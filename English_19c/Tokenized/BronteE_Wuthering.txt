1801
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
just
returned
from
a
visit
to
my
landlord
 
the
solitary
neighbour
that
I
shall
be
troubled
with
.
<EOS>
This
is
certainly
a
beautiful
country
!
<EOS>
In
all
England
,
I
do
not
believe
that
I
could
have
fixed
on
a
situation
so
completely
removed
from
the
stir
of
society
.
<EOS>
A
perfect
misanthropist
's
heaven
:
and
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
and
I
are
such
a
suitable
pair
to
divide
the
desolation
between
us
.
<EOS>
A
capital
fellow
!
<EOS>
He
little
imagined
how
my
heart
warmed
towards
him
when
I
beheld
his
black
eyes
withdraw
so
suspiciously
under
their
brows
,
as
I
rode
up
,
and
when
his
fingers
sheltered
themselves
,
with
a
jealous
resolution
,
still
further
in
his
waistcoat
,
as
I
announced
my
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Heathcliff
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
A
nod
was
the
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Lockwood
,
your
new
tenant
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
do
myself
the
honour
of
calling
as
soon
as
possible
after
my
arrival
,
to
express
the
hope
that
I
have
not
inconvenienced
you
by
my
perseverance
in
soliciting
the
occupation
of
Thrushcross
Grange
<EOS>
:
I
heard
yesterday
you
had
had
some
thoughts
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Thrushcross
Grange
is
my
own
,
sir
,
"
he
interrupted
,
wincing
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
allow
any
one
to
inconvenience
me
,
if
I
could
hinder
it
 
walk
in
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
"
walk
in
"
was
uttered
with
closed
teeth
,
and
expressed
the
sentiment
,
"
Go
to
the
Deuce
:
"
even
the
gate
over
which
he
leant
manifested
no
sympathising
movement
to
the
words
;
and
I
think
that
circumstance
determined
me
to
accept
the
invitation
<EOS>
:
I
felt
interested
in
a
man
who
seemed
more
exaggeratedly
reserved
than
myself
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
saw
my
horse
's
breast
fairly
pushing
the
barrier
,
he
did
put
out
his
hand
to
unchain
it
,
and
then
sullenly
preceded
me
up
the
causeway
,
calling
,
as
we
entered
the
court
,
 
"
Joseph
,
take
Mr.
Lockwood
's
horse
;
and
bring
up
some
wine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
we
have
the
whole
establishment
of
domestics
,
I
suppose
,
"
was
the
reflection
suggested
by
this
compound
order
.
"
<EOS>
No
wonder
the
grass
grows
up
between
the
flags
,
and
cattle
are
the
only
hedge
-
cutters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Joseph
was
an
elderly
,
nay
,
an
old
man
:
very
old
,
perhaps
,
though
hale
and
sinewy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Lord
help
us
!
"
<EOS>
he
soliloquised
in
an
undertone
of
peevish
displeasure
,
while
relieving
me
of
my
horse
:
looking
,
meantime
,
in
my
face
so
sourly
that
I
charitably
conjectured
he
must
have
need
of
divine
aid
to
digest
his
dinner
,
and
his
pious
ejaculation
had
no
reference
to
my
unexpected
advent
.
  
<EOS>
Wuthering
Heights
is
the
name
of
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
dwelling
.
<EOS>
"
Wuthering
"
being
a
significant
provincial
adjective
,
descriptive
of
the
atmospheric
tumult
to
which
its
station
is
exposed
in
stormy
weather
.
<EOS>
Pure
,
bracing
ventilation
they
must
have
up
there
at
all
times
,
indeed
<EOS>
:
one
may
guess
the
power
of
the
north
wind
blowing
over
the
edge
,
by
the
excessive
slant
of
a
few
stunted
firs
at
the
end
of
the
house
;
and
by
a
range
of
gaunt
thorns
all
stretching
their
limbs
one
way
,
as
if
craving
alms
of
the
sun
.
<EOS>
Happily
,
the
architect
had
foresight
to
build
it
strong
:
the
narrow
windows
are
deeply
set
in
the
wall
,
and
the
corners
defended
with
large
jutting
stones
.
  
<EOS>
Before
passing
the
threshold
,
I
paused
to
admire
a
quantity
of
grotesque
carving
lavished
over
the
front
,
and
especially
about
the
principal
door
;
above
which
,
among
a
wilderness
of
crumbling
griffins
and
shameless
little
boys
,
I
detected
the
date
"
1500
,
"
and
the
name
"
Hareton
Earnshaw
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
made
a
few
comments
,
and
requested
a
short
history
of
the
place
from
the
surly
owner
;
but
his
attitude
at
the
door
appeared
to
demand
my
speedy
entrance
,
or
complete
departure
,
and
I
had
no
desire
to
aggravate
his
impatience
previous
to
inspecting
the
penetralium
.
  
<EOS>
One
stop
brought
us
into
the
family
sitting
-
room
,
without
any
introductory
lobby
or
passage
:
they
call
it
here
"
the
house
"
pre
-
eminently
.
<EOS>
It
includes
kitchen
and
parlour
,
generally
;
but
I
believe
at
Wuthering
Heights
<EOS>
the
kitchen
is
forced
to
retreat
altogether
into
another
quarter
:
at
least
I
distinguished
a
chatter
of
tongues
,
and
a
clatter
of
culinary
utensils
,
deep
within
;
and
I
observed
no
signs
of
roasting
,
boiling
,
or
baking
,
about
the
huge
fireplace
;
nor
any
glitter
of
copper
saucepans
and
tin
cullenders
on
the
walls
.
<EOS>
One
end
,
indeed
,
reflected
splendidly
both
light
and
heat
from
ranks
of
immense
pewter
dishes
,
interspersed
with
silver
jugs
and
tankards
,
towering
row
after
row
,
on
a
vast
oak
dresser
,
to
the
very
roof
.
<EOS>
The
latter
had
never
been
under
-
drawn
:
its
entire
anatomy
lay
bare
to
an
inquiring
eye
,
except
where
a
frame
of
wood
laden
with
oatcakes
and
clusters
of
legs
of
beef
,
mutton
,
and
ham
,
concealed
it
.
<EOS>
Above
the
chimney
were
sundry
villainous
old
guns
,
and
a
couple
of
horse
-
pistols
:
and
,
by
way
of
ornament
,
three
gaudily
-
painted
canisters
disposed
along
its
ledge
.
<EOS>
The
floor
was
of
smooth
,
white
stone
;
the
chairs
,
high
-
backed
,
primitive
structures
,
painted
green
:
one
or
two
heavy
black
ones
lurking
in
the
shade
.
<EOS>
In
an
arch
under
the
dresser
reposed
a
huge
,
liver
-
coloured
bitch
pointer
,
surrounded
by
a
swarm
of
squealing
puppies
;
and
other
dogs
haunted
other
recesses
.
  
<EOS>
The
apartment
and
furniture
would
have
been
nothing
extraordinary
as
belonging
to
a
homely
,
northern
farmer
,
with
a
stubborn
countenance
,
and
stalwart
limbs
set
out
to
advantage
in
knee
-
breeches
and
gaiters
.
<EOS>
Such
an
individual
seated
in
his
arm
-
chair
,
his
mug
of
ale
frothing
on
the
round
table
before
him
,
is
to
be
seen
in
any
circuit
of
five
or
six
miles
among
these
hills
,
if
you
go
at
the
right
time
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Heathcliff
forms
a
singular
contrast
to
his
abode
and
style
of
living
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
dark
-
skinned
gipsy
in
aspect
,
in
dress
and
manners
<EOS>
a
gentleman
:
<EOS>
that
is
,
as
much
a
gentleman
as
many
a
country
squire
:
<EOS>
rather
slovenly
,
perhaps
,
yet
not
looking
amiss
with
his
negligence
,
because
he
has
an
erect
and
handsome
figure
;
and
rather
morose
.
<EOS>
Possibly
,
some
people
might
suspect
him
of
a
degree
of
under
-
bred
pride
;
I
have
a
sympathetic
chord
within
that
tells
me
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort
<EOS>
:
I
know
,
by
instinct
,
his
reserve
springs
from
an
aversion
to
showy
displays
of
feeling
 
to
manifestations
of
mutual
kindliness
.
<EOS>
He
'll
love
and
hate
equally
under
cover
,
and
esteem
it
a
species
of
impertinence
to
be
loved
or
hated
again
.
<EOS>
No
,
I
'm
running
on
too
fast
<EOS>
:
I
bestow
my
own
attributes
over
-
liberally
on
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
may
have
entirely
dissimilar
reasons
for
keeping
his
hand
out
of
the
way
when
he
meets
a
would
-
be
acquaintance
,
to
those
which
actuate
me
.
<EOS>
Let
me
hope
my
constitution
is
almost
peculiar
:
my
dear
mother
used
to
say
I
should
never
have
a
comfortable
home
;
and
only
last
summer
I
proved
myself
perfectly
unworthy
of
one
.
  
<EOS>
While
enjoying
a
month
of
fine
weather
at
the
sea
-
coast
,
I
was
thrown
into
the
company
of
a
most
fascinating
creature
:
a
real
goddess
in
my
eyes
,
as
long
as
she
took
no
notice
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
"
never
told
my
love
"
vocally
;
still
,
if
looks
have
language
,
the
merest
idiot
might
have
guessed
I
was
over
head
and
ears
:
she
understood
me
at
last
,
and
looked
a
return
 
the
sweetest
of
all
imaginable
looks
.
<EOS>
And
what
did
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
confess
it
with
shame
 
shrunk
icily
into
myself
,
like
a
snail
;
at
every
glance
retired
colder
and
farther
;
till
finally
the
poor
innocent
was
led
to
doubt
her
own
senses
,
and
,
overwhelmed
with
confusion
at
her
supposed
mistake
,
persuaded
her
mamma
to
decamp
.
<EOS>
By
this
curious
turn
of
disposition
I
have
gained
the
reputation
of
deliberate
heartlessness
;
how
undeserved
,
I
alone
can
appreciate
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
a
seat
at
the
end
of
the
hearthstone
opposite
that
towards
which
my
landlord
advanced
,
and
filled
up
an
interval
of
silence
by
attempting
to
caress
the
canine
mother
,
who
had
left
her
nursery
,
and
was
sneaking
wolfishly
to
the
back
of
my
legs
,
her
lip
curled
up
,
and
her
white
teeth
watering
for
a
snatch
.
<EOS>
My
caress
provoked
a
long
,
guttural
gnarl
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
let
the
dog
alone
,
"
growled
Mr.
Heathcliff
in
unison
,
checking
fiercer
demonstrations
with
a
punch
of
his
foot
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
not
accustomed
to
be
spoiled
 
not
kept
for
a
pet
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
striding
to
a
side
door
,
he
shouted
again
,
"
Joseph
!
"
  
<EOS>
Joseph
mumbled
indistinctly
in
the
depths
of
the
cellar
,
but
gave
no
intimation
of
ascending
;
so
his
master
dived
down
to
him
,
leaving
me
_
vis
-
a
-
vis
_
the
ruffianly
bitch
and
a
pair
of
grim
shaggy
sheep
-
dogs
,
who
shared
with
her
a
jealous
guardianship
over
all
my
movements
.
<EOS>
Not
anxious
to
come
in
contact
with
their
fangs
,
I
sat
still
;
but
,
imagining
they
would
scarcely
understand
tacit
insults
<EOS>
,
I
unfortunately
indulged
in
winking
and
making
faces
at
the
trio
,
and
some
turn
of
my
physiognomy
so
irritated
madam
,
that
she
suddenly
broke
into
a
fury
and
leapt
on
my
knees
.
<EOS>
I
flung
her
back
,
and
hastened
to
interpose
the
table
between
us
.
<EOS>
This
proceeding
aroused
the
whole
hive
:
half
-
a
-
dozen
four
-
footed
fiends
,
of
various
sizes
and
ages
,
issued
from
hidden
dens
to
the
common
centre
.
<EOS>
I
felt
my
heels
and
coat
-
laps
peculiar
subjects
of
assault
;
and
parrying
off
the
larger
combatants
as
effectually
as
I
could
with
the
poker
,
I
was
constrained
to
demand
,
aloud
,
assistance
from
some
of
the
household
in
re
-
establishing
peace
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
and
his
man
climbed
the
cellar
steps
with
vexatious
phlegm
<EOS>
:
I
do
n't
think
they
moved
one
second
faster
than
usual
,
though
the
hearth
was
an
absolute
tempest
of
worrying
and
yelping
.
<EOS>
Happily
,
an
inhabitant
of
the
kitchen
made
more
despatch
:
<EOS>
a
lusty
dame
,
with
tucked
-
up
gown
,
bare
arms
,
and
fire
-
flushed
cheeks
,
rushed
into
the
midst
of
us
flourishing
a
frying
-
pan
:
and
used
that
weapon
,
and
her
tongue
,
to
such
purpose
,
that
the
storm
subsided
magically
,
and
she
only
remained
,
heaving
like
a
sea
after
a
high
wind
,
when
her
master
entered
on
the
scene
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
is
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
eyeing
me
in
a
manner
that
I
could
ill
endure
,
after
this
inhospitable
treatment
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
the
devil
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
I
muttered
.
<EOS>
"
The
herd
of
possessed
swine
could
have
had
no
worse
spirits
in
them
than
those
animals
of
yours
,
sir
.
<EOS>
You
might
as
well
leave
a
stranger
with
a
brood
of
tigers
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
wo
n't
meddle
with
persons
who
touch
nothing
,
"
he
remarked
,
putting
the
bottle
before
me
,
and
restoring
the
displaced
table
.
<EOS>
"
The
dogs
do
right
to
be
vigilant
.
<EOS>
Take
a
glass
of
wine
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
bitten
,
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
been
,
I
would
have
set
my
signet
on
the
biter
.
<EOS>
"
Heathcliff
's
countenance
relaxed
into
a
grin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
are
flurried
,
Mr.
Lockwood
.
<EOS>
Here
,
take
a
little
wine
.
<EOS>
Guests
are
so
exceedingly
rare
in
this
house
that
I
and
my
dogs
,
I
am
willing
to
own
,
hardly
know
how
to
receive
them
.
<EOS>
Your
health
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
bowed
and
returned
the
pledge
;
beginning
to
perceive
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
sit
sulking
for
the
misbehaviour
of
a
pack
of
curs
;
besides
,
I
felt
loth
to
yield
the
fellow
further
amusement
at
my
expense
;
since
his
humour
took
that
turn
.
<EOS>
He
 
probably
swayed
by
prudential
consideration
of
the
folly
of
offending
a
good
tenant
 
relaxed
a
little
in
the
laconic
style
of
chipping
off
his
pronouns
and
auxiliary
verbs
,
and
introduced
what
he
supposed
would
be
a
subject
of
interest
to
me
,
 
a
discourse
on
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
my
present
place
of
retirement
.
<EOS>
I
found
him
very
intelligent
on
the
topics
we
touched
;
and
before
I
went
home
,
I
was
encouraged
so
far
as
to
volunteer
another
visit
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
evidently
wished
no
repetition
of
my
intrusion
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
,
notwithstanding
.
<EOS>
It
is
astonishing
how
sociable
I
feel
myself
compared
with
him
.
    
<EOS>
Yesterday
afternoon
set
in
misty
and
cold
.
<EOS>
I
had
half
a
mind
to
spend
it
by
my
study
fire
,
instead
of
wading
through
heath
and
mud
to
Wuthering
Heights
.
<EOS>
On
coming
up
from
dinner
,
however
,
(
N.B.
 
I
dine
between
twelve
and
one
o'clock
;
the
housekeeper
,
a
matronly
lady
,
taken
as
a
fixture
along
with
the
house
,
could
not
,
or
would
not
,
comprehend
my
request
that
I
might
be
served
at
five
)
 
on
mounting
the
stairs
with
this
lazy
intention
,
and
stepping
into
the
room
,
I
saw
a
servant
-
girl
on
her
knees
surrounded
by
brushes
and
coal
-
scuttles
,
and
raising
an
infernal
dust
as
she
extinguished
the
flames
with
heaps
of
cinders
.
<EOS>
This
spectacle
drove
me
back
immediately
;
I
took
my
hat
,
and
,
after
a
four
-
miles
'
walk
,
arrived
at
Heathcliff
's
garden
-
gate
just
in
time
to
escape
the
first
feathery
flakes
of
a
snow
-
shower
.
  
<EOS>
On
that
bleak
hill
-
top
the
earth
was
hard
with
a
black
frost
,
and
the
air
made
me
shiver
through
every
limb
.
<EOS>
Being
unable
to
remove
the
chain
,
I
jumped
over
,
and
,
running
up
the
flagged
causeway
bordered
with
straggling
gooseberry
-
bushes
,
knocked
vainly
for
admittance
,
till
my
knuckles
tingled
and
the
dogs
howled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wretched
inmates
!
<EOS>
"
I
ejaculated
,
mentally
,
"
you
deserve
perpetual
isolation
from
your
species
for
your
churlish
inhospitality
.
<EOS>
At
least
,
I
would
not
keep
my
doors
barred
in
the
day
-
time
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
 
I
will
get
in
!
"
<EOS>
So
resolved
,
I
grasped
the
latch
and
shook
it
vehemently
.
<EOS>
Vinegar
-
faced
Joseph
projected
his
head
from
a
round
window
of
the
barn
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
ye
for
?
"
<EOS>
he
shouted
.
<EOS>
"
T

<EOS>
Go

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
nobody
inside
to
open
the
door
?
<EOS>
"
I
hallooed
,
responsively
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
nobbut

and
shoo'll

"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
Can
not
you
tell
her
whom
I
am
,
eh
,
Joseph
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
-
ne

!
<EOS>
I
'll
hae
no

"
muttered
the
head
,
vanishing
.
  
<EOS>
The
snow
began
to
drive
thickly
.
<EOS>
I
seized
the
handle
to
essay
another
trial
;
when
a
young
man
without
coat
,
and
shouldering
a
pitchfork
,
appeared
in
the
yard
behind
.
<EOS>
He
hailed
me
to
follow
him
,
and
,
after
marching
through
a
wash
-
house
,
and
a
paved
area
containing
a
coal
-
shed
,
pump
,
and
pigeon
-
cot
,
we
at
length
arrived
in
the
huge
,
warm
,
cheerful
apartment
where
I
was
formerly
received
.
<EOS>
It
glowed
delightfully
in
the
radiance
of
an
immense
fire
,
compounded
of
coal
,
peat
,
and
wood
;
and
near
the
table
,
laid
for
a
plentiful
evening
meal
,
I
was
pleased
to
observe
the
"
missis
,
"
an
individual
whose
existence
I
had
never
previously
suspected
.
<EOS>
I
bowed
and
waited
,
thinking
she
would
bid
me
take
a
seat
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
me
,
leaning
back
in
her
chair
,
and
remained
motionless
and
mute
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rough
weather
!
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
,
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
the
door
must
bear
the
consequence
of
your
servants
'
leisure
attendance
:
I
had
hard
work
to
make
them
hear
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
never
opened
her
mouth
.
<EOS>
I
stared
 
<EOS>
she
stared
also
:
at
any
rate
,
she
kept
her
eyes
on
me
in
a
cool
,
regardless
manner
,
exceedingly
embarrassing
and
disagreeable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
gruffly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
'll
be
in
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
obeyed
;
and
hemmed
,
and
called
the
villain
Juno
,
who
deigned
,
at
this
second
interview
,
to
move
the
extreme
tip
of
her
tail
,
in
token
of
owning
my
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
beautiful
animal
!
<EOS>
"
I
commenced
again
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
intend
parting
with
the
little
ones
,
madam
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
not
mine
,
"
said
the
amiable
hostess
,
more
repellingly
than
Heathcliff
himself
could
have
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
your
favourites
are
among
these
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
continued
,
turning
to
an
obscure
cushion
full
of
something
like
cats
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
strange
choice
of
favourites
!
"
<EOS>
she
observed
scornfully
.
  
<EOS>
Unluckily
,
it
was
a
heap
of
dead
rabbits
.
<EOS>
I
hemmed
once
more
,
and
drew
closer
to
the
hearth
,
repeating
my
comment
on
the
wildness
of
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
not
have
come
out
,
"
she
said
,
rising
and
reaching
from
the
chimney
-
piece
two
of
the
painted
canisters
.
  
<EOS>
Her
position
before
was
sheltered
from
the
light
;
now
,
I
had
a
distinct
view
of
her
whole
figure
and
countenance
.
<EOS>
She
was
slender
,
and
apparently
scarcely
past
girlhood
:
an
admirable
form
,
and
the
most
exquisite
little
face
that
I
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
beholding
;
small
features
,
very
fair
;
flaxen
ringlets
,
or
rather
golden
,
hanging
loose
on
her
delicate
neck
;
and
eyes
,
<EOS>
had
they
been
agreeable
in
expression
,
that
would
have
been
irresistible
:
fortunately
for
my
susceptible
heart
,
the
only
sentiment
they
evinced
hovered
between
scorn
and
a
kind
of
desperation
,
singularly
unnatural
to
be
detected
there
.
<EOS>
The
canisters
were
almost
out
of
her
reach
;
I
made
a
motion
to
aid
her
;
she
turned
upon
me
as
a
miser
might
turn
if
any
one
attempted
to
assist
him
in
counting
his
gold
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
your
help
,
"
she
snapped
;
"
I
can
get
them
for
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
!
<EOS>
"
I
hastened
to
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Were
you
asked
to
tea
?
"
<EOS>
she
demanded
,
tying
an
apron
over
her
neat
black
frock
,
and
standing
with
a
spoonful
of
the
leaf
poised
over
the
pot
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad
to
have
a
cup
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Were
you
asked
?
"
she
repeated
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
I
said
,
half
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
proper
person
to
ask
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
flung
the
tea
back
,
spoon
and
all
,
and
resumed
her
chair
in
a
pet
;
her
forehead
corrugated
,
and
her
red
under
-
lip
pushed
out
,
like
a
child
's
ready
to
cry
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
young
man
had
slung
on
to
his
person
a
decidedly
shabby
upper
garment
,
and
,
erecting
himself
before
the
blaze
,
looked
down
on
me
from
the
corner
of
his
eyes
,
for
all
the
world
as
if
there
were
some
mortal
feud
unavenged
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
doubt
whether
he
were
a
servant
or
not
:
his
dress
and
speech
were
both
rude
,
entirely
devoid
of
the
superiority
observable
in
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Heathcliff
;
his
thick
brown
curls
were
rough
and
uncultivated
,
his
whiskers
encroached
bearishly
over
his
cheeks
,
and
his
hands
were
embrowned
like
those
of
a
common
labourer
:
still
his
bearing
was
free
,
almost
haughty
,
and
he
showed
none
of
a
domestic
's
assiduity
in
attending
on
the
lady
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
In
the
absence
of
clear
proofs
of
his
condition
,
I
deemed
it
best
to
abstain
from
noticing
his
curious
conduct
;
and
,
five
minutes
afterwards
,
the
entrance
of
Heathcliff
relieved
me
,
in
some
measure
,
from
my
uncomfortable
state
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
sir
,
I
am
come
,
according
to
promise
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
,
assuming
the
cheerful
;
"
and
I
fear
I
shall
be
weather
-
bound
for
half
an
hour
,
if
you
can
afford
me
shelter
during
that
space
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Half
an
hour
<EOS>
?
"
he
said
,
shaking
the
white
flakes
from
his
clothes
;
"
I
wonder
you
should
select
the
thick
of
a
snow
-
storm
to
ramble
about
in
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
that
you
run
a
risk
of
being
lost
in
the
marshes
?
<EOS>
People
familiar
with
these
moors
often
miss
their
road
on
such
evenings
;
and
I
can
tell
you
there
is
no
chance
of
a
change
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
can
get
a
guide
among
your
lads
,
and
he
might
stay
at
the
Grange
till
morning
 
<EOS>
could
you
spare
me
one
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
could
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
I
must
trust
to
my
own
sagacity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Umph
!
"
  
"
Are
you
going
to
mak
'
the
tea
?
"
demanded
he
of
the
shabby
coat
,
shifting
his
ferocious
gaze
from
me
to
the
young
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
_
<EOS>
he
_
<EOS>
to
have
any
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
appealing
to
Heathcliff
.
  
<EOS>
"
Get
it
ready
,
will
you
?
"
was
the
answer
,
uttered
so
savagely
that
I
started
.
<EOS>
The
tone
in
which
the
words
were
said
revealed
a
genuine
bad
nature
.
<EOS>
I
no
longer
felt
inclined
to
call
Heathcliff
a
capital
fellow
.
<EOS>
When
the
preparations
were
finished
,
he
invited
me
with
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
sir
,
bring
forward
your
chair
.
"
<EOS>
And
we
all
,
including
the
rustic
youth
,
drew
round
the
table
:
an
austere
silence
prevailing
while
we
discussed
our
meal
.
  
<EOS>
I
thought
,
if
I
had
caused
the
cloud
,
it
was
my
duty
to
make
an
effort
to
dispel
it
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
every
day
sit
so
grim
and
taciturn
;
and
it
was
impossible
<EOS>
,
however
ill
-
tempered
they
might
be
,
that
the
universal
scowl
they
wore
was
their
every
-
day
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
strange
,
"
I
began
,
<EOS>
in
the
interval
of
swallowing
one
cup
of
tea
and
receiving
another
 
"
it
is
strange
how
custom
can
mould
our
tastes
and
ideas
:
many
could
not
imagine
the
existence
of
happiness
in
a
life
of
such
complete
exile
from
the
world
as
you
spend
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
;
yet
,
I
'll
venture
to
say
,
that
,
surrounded
by
your
family
,
and
with
your
amiable
lady
as
the
presiding
genius
over
your
home
and
heart
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
My
amiable
lady
!
"
<EOS>
he
interrupted
,
with
an
almost
diabolical
sneer
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
is
she
 
my
amiable
lady
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
your
wife
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
yes
 
oh
,
you
would
intimate
that
her
spirit
has
taken
the
post
of
ministering
angel
,
and
guards
the
fortunes
of
Wuthering
Heights
,
even
when
her
body
is
gone
.
<EOS>
Is
that
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Perceiving
myself
in
a
blunder
,
I
attempted
to
correct
it
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
seen
there
was
too
great
a
disparity
between
the
ages
of
the
parties
to
make
it
likely
that
they
were
man
and
wife
.
<EOS>
One
was
about
forty
:
a
period
of
mental
vigour
at
which
men
seldom
cherish
the
delusion
of
being
married
for
love
by
girls
:
that
dream
is
reserved
for
the
solace
of
our
declining
years
.
<EOS>
The
other
did
not
look
seventeen
.
  
<EOS>
Then
it
flashed
upon
me
 
<EOS>
"
The
clown
at
my
elbow
,
who
is
drinking
his
tea
out
of
a
basin
and
eating
his
bread
with
unwashed
hands
,
may
be
her
husband
:
<EOS>
Heathcliff
junior
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
Here
is
the
consequence
of
being
buried
alive
:
she
has
thrown
herself
away
upon
that
boor
from
sheer
ignorance
that
better
individuals
existed
!
<EOS>
A
sad
pity
 
<EOS>
I
must
beware
how
I
cause
her
to
regret
her
choice
.
<EOS>
"
The
last
reflection
may
seem
conceited
;
it
was
not
.
<EOS>
My
neighbour
struck
me
as
bordering
on
repulsive
;
I
knew
,
through
experience
,
that
I
was
tolerably
attractive
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Heathcliff
is
my
daughter
-
in
-
law
,
"
said
Heathcliff
,
corroborating
my
surmise
.
<EOS>
He
turned
,
as
he
spoke
,
a
peculiar
look
in
her
direction
:
a
look
of
hatred
;
unless
he
has
a
most
perverse
set
of
facial
muscles
that
will
not
,
like
those
of
other
people
,
interpret
the
language
of
his
soul
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
certainly
 
I
see
now
:
you
are
the
favoured
possessor
of
the
beneficent
fairy
,
"
I
remarked
,
turning
to
my
neighbour
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
worse
than
before
:
the
youth
grew
crimson
,
and
clenched
his
fist
,
with
every
appearance
of
a
meditated
assault
.
<EOS>
But
he
seemed
to
recollect
himself
presently
,
and
smothered
the
storm
in
a
brutal
curse
,
muttered
on
my
behalf
:
which
,
however
,
I
took
care
not
to
notice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Unhappy
in
your
conjectures
,
sir
,
"
observed
my
host
;
"
we
neither
of
us
have
the
privilege
of
owning
your
good
fairy
;
her
mate
is
dead
.
<EOS>
I
said
she
was
my
daughter
-
in
-
law
:
therefore
,
she
must
have
married
my
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
this
young
man
is
 
"
  
"
Not
my
son
,
assuredly
.
"
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
smiled
again
,
as
if
it
were
rather
too
bold
a
jest
to
attribute
the
paternity
of
that
bear
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Hareton
Earnshaw
,
"
growled
the
other
;
"
and
I
'd
counsel
you
to
respect
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
shown
no
disrespect
,
"
was
my
reply
,
laughing
internally
at
the
dignity
with
which
he
announced
himself
.
  
<EOS>
He
fixed
his
eye
on
me
longer
than
I
cared
to
return
the
stare
,
for
fear
I
might
be
tempted
either
to
box
his
ears
or
render
my
hilarity
audible
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
feel
unmistakably
out
of
place
in
that
pleasant
family
circle
.
<EOS>
The
dismal
spiritual
atmosphere
overcame
,
and
more
than
neutralised
,
the
glowing
physical
comforts
round
me
;
and
I
resolved
to
be
cautious
how
I
ventured
under
those
rafters
a
third
time
.
  
<EOS>
The
business
of
eating
being
concluded
,
and
no
one
uttering
a
word
of
sociable
conversation
,
I
approached
a
window
to
examine
the
weather
.
<EOS>
A
sorrowful
sight
I
saw
:
dark
night
coming
down
prematurely
,
and
sky
and
hills
mingled
in
one
bitter
whirl
of
wind
and
suffocating

<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
it
possible
for
me
to
get
home
now
without
a
guide
,
"
I
could
not
help
exclaiming
.
<EOS>
"
The
roads
will
be
buried
already
;
and
,
if
they
were
bare
,
I
could
scarcely
distinguish
a
foot
in
advance

<EOS>
"
  
"
Hareton
,
drive
those
dozen
sheep
into
the
barn
porch
.
<EOS>
They
'll
be
covered
if
left
in
the
fold
all
night
:
and
put
a
plank
before
them

"
said
Heathcliff
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
must
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
I
continued
,
with
rising
irritation
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
reply
to
my
question
;
and
on
looking
round
I
saw
only
Joseph
bringing
in
a
pail
of
porridge
for
the
dogs
,
and
Mrs.
Heathcliff
leaning
over
the
fire
,
diverting
herself
with
burning
a
bundle
of
matches
which
had
fallen
from
the
chimney
-
piece
as
she
restored
the
tea
-
canister
to
its
place
.
<EOS>
The
former
,
when
he
had
deposited
his
burden
,
took
a
critical
survey
of
the
room
,
and
in
cracked
tones
grated
out
 
"
Aw

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
imagined
,
for
a
moment
,
that
this
piece
of
eloquence
was
addressed
to
me
;
and
,
sufficiently
enraged
,
stepped
towards
the
aged
rascal
with
an
intention
of
kicking
him
out
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
however
,
checked
me
by
her
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
scandalous
old
hypocrite
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
not
afraid
of
being
carried
away
bodily
,
whenever
you
mention
the
devil

<EOS>
I
warn
you
to
refrain
from
provoking
me
,
or
I
'll
ask
your
abduction
as
a
special
favour

<EOS>
Stop
!
<EOS>
look
here
,
Joseph
,
"
she
continued
,
taking
a
long
,
dark
book
from
a
shelf
;
"
I
'll
show
you
how
far
I
've
progressed
in
the
Black
Art

I
shall
soon
be
competent
to
make
a
clear
house
of
it

<EOS>
The
red
cow
did
n't
die
by
chance
;
and
your
rheumatism
can
hardly
be
reckoned
among
providential
visitations
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
wicked
,
wicked
!
"
<EOS>
gasped
the
elder
;
"
may
the
Lord
deliver
us
from
evil
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No

seriously

Go

I

looking

"
  
<EOS>
The
little
witch
put
a
mock
malignity
into
her
beautiful
eyes
,
and
Joseph
,
trembling
with
sincere
horror
,
hurried
out
,
praying
,
and
ejaculating
"
wicked
"
as
he
went
.
<EOS>
I
thought
her
conduct
must
be
prompted
by
a
species
of
dreary
fun
;
and
,
now
that
we
were
alone
,
I
endeavoured
to
interest
her
in
my
distress
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
"
I
said
earnestly
,
"
you
must
excuse
me
for
troubling
you
.
<EOS>
I
presume
,
because
,
with
that
face
,
I
'm
sure
you
can
not
help
being
good
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
Do
point
out
some
landmarks
by
which
I
may
know
my
way
home
<EOS>
:
I
have
no
more
idea
how
to
get
there
than
you
would
have
how
to
get
to
London
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
the
road
you
came
,
"
she
answered
,
ensconcing
herself
in
a
chair
,
with
a
candle
,
and
the
long
book
open
before
her
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
brief
advice
,
but
as
sound
as
I
can
give
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
if
you
hear
of
me
being
discovered
dead
in
a
bog
or
a
pit
full
of
snow
,
your
conscience
wo
n't
whisper
that
it
is
partly
your
fault
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
so
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
escort
you
.
<EOS>
They
would
n't
let
me
go
to
the
end
of
the
garden
wall
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
<EOS>
_
!
<EOS>
I
should
be
sorry
to
ask
you
to
cross
the
threshold
,
for
my
convenience
,
on
such
a
night
,
"
I
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
tell
me
my
way
,
not
to
_
show
_
it
:
or
else
to
persuade
Mr.
Heathcliff
to
give
me
a
guide
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
?
<EOS>
There
is
himself
,
Earnshaw
,
Zillah
,
Joseph
and
I.
<EOS>
Which
would
you
have
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
there
no
boys
at
the
farm
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
those
are
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
it
follows
that
I
am
compelled
to
stay
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
you
may
settle
with
your
host
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
to
make
no
more
rash
journeys
on
these
hills
,
"
cried
Heathcliff
's
stern
voice
from
the
kitchen
entrance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
staying
here
,
I
do
n't
keep
accommodations
for
visitors
:
you
must
share
a
bed
with
Hareton
or
Joseph
,
if
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
sleep
on
a
chair
in
this
room
,
"
I
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
!
<EOS>
A
stranger
is
a
stranger
,
be
he
rich
or
poor
:
it
will
not
suit
me
to
permit
any
one
the
range
of
the
place
while
I
am
off
guard
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
unmannerly
wretch
.
  
<EOS>
With
this
insult
my
patience
was
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
I
uttered
an
expression
of
disgust
,
and
pushed
past
him
into
the
yard
,
running
against
Earnshaw
in
my
haste
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
dark
that
I
could
not
see
the
means
of
exit
;
<EOS>
and
,
as
I
wandered
round
,
I
heard
another
specimen
of
their
civil
behaviour
amongst
each
other
.
<EOS>
At
first
the
young
man
appeared
about
to
befriend
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
with
him
as
far
as
the
park
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
go
with
him
to
hell
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
his
master
,
or
whatever
relation
he
bore
.
"
<EOS>
And
who
is
to
look
after
the
horses
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
man
's
life
is
of
more
consequence
than
one
evening
's
neglect
of
the
horses
:
somebody
must
go
,
"
murmured
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
more
kindly
than
I
expected
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
your
command
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Hareton
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
set
store
on
him
,
you
'd
better
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
hope
his
ghost
will
haunt
you
;
and
I
hope
Mr.
Heathcliff
will
never
get
another
tenant
till
the
Grange
is
a
ruin
,
"
she
answered
,
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hearken
,
hearken
,
shoo
's
cursing
on
'
em
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Joseph
,
towards
whom
I
had
been
steering
.
  
<EOS>
He
sat
within
earshot
,
milking
the
cows
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
,
which
I
seized
unceremoniously
,
and
,
calling
out
that
I
would
send
it
back
on
the
morrow
,
rushed
to
the
nearest
postern
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maister
,
maister
,
he
's
staling
t
'
lanthern
!
"
<EOS>
shouted
the
ancient
,
pursuing
my
retreat
.
"
<EOS>
Hey
,
Gnasher
!
<EOS>
Hey
,
dog
!
<EOS>
Hey
Wolf
,
holld
him
,
holld
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
On
opening
the
little
door
,
two
hairy
monsters
flew
at
my
throat
,
bearing
me
down
,
and
extinguishing
the
light
;
while
a
mingled
guffaw
from
Heathcliff
and
Hareton
put
the
copestone
on
my
rage
and
humiliation
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
the
beasts
seemed
more
bent
on
stretching
their
paws
,
and
yawning
,
and
flourishing
their
tails
,
than
devouring
me
alive
;
but
they
would
suffer
no
resurrection
,
and
I
was
forced
to
lie
till
their
malignant
masters
pleased
to
deliver
me
:
then
,
hatless
and
trembling
with
wrath
,
I
ordered
the
miscreants
to
let
me
out
 
on
their
peril
to
keep
me
one
minute
longer
 
with
several
incoherent
threats
of
retaliation
that
,
in
their
indefinite
depth
of
virulency
,
smacked
of
King
Lear
.
  
<EOS>
The
vehemence
of
my
agitation
brought
on
a
copious
bleeding
at
the
nose
,
and
still
Heathcliff
laughed
,
and
still
I
scolded
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
would
have
concluded
the
scene
,
had
there
not
been
one
person
at
hand
rather
more
rational
than
myself
,
and
more
benevolent
than
my
entertainer
.
<EOS>
This
was
Zillah
,
the
stout
housewife
;
who
at
length
issued
forth
to
inquire
into
the
nature
of
the
uproar
.
<EOS>
She
thought
that
some
of
them
had
been
laying
violent
hands
on
me
;
and
,
not
daring
to
attack
her
master
,
she
turned
her
vocal
artillery
against
the
younger
scoundrel
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr.
Earnshaw
,
"
she
cried
,
"
I
wonder
what
you
'll
have
agait
next
?
<EOS>
Are
we
going
to
murder
folk
on
our
very
door
-
stones
?
<EOS>
I
see
this
house
will
never
do
for
me
 
look
at
t
'
poor
lad
,
he
's
fair
choking
!
<EOS>
Wisht
,
wisht
;
you
mun'n"t
go
on
so
.
<EOS>
Come
in
,
and
I
'll
cure
that
:
there
now
,
hold
ye
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
With
these
words
she
suddenly
splashed
a
pint
of
icy
water
down
my
neck
,
and
pulled
me
into
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
followed
,
his
accidental
merriment
expiring
quickly
in
his
habitual
moroseness
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
sick
exceedingly
,
and
dizzy
,
and
faint
;
and
thus
compelled
perforce
to
accept
lodgings
under
his
roof
.
<EOS>
He
told
Zillah
to
give
me
a
glass
of
brandy
,
and
then
passed
on
to
the
inner
room
;
while
she
condoled
with
me
on
my
sorry
predicament
,
and
having
obeyed
his
orders
,
whereby
I
was
somewhat
revived
,
ushered
me
to
bed
.
    
<EOS>
While
leading
the
way
upstairs
,
she
recommended
that
I
should
hide
the
candle
,
and
not
make
a
noise
;
for
her
master
had
an
odd
notion
about
the
chamber
she
would
put
me
in
,
and
never
let
anybody
lodge
there
willingly
.
<EOS>
I
asked
the
reason
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
know
,
she
answered
:
she
had
only
lived
there
a
year
or
two
;
and
they
had
so
many
queer
goings
on
,
she
could
not
begin
to
be
curious
.
  
<EOS>
Too
stupefied
to
be
curious
myself
,
I
fastened
my
door
and
glanced
round
for
the
bed
.
<EOS>
The
whole
furniture
consisted
of
a
chair
,
a
clothes
-
press
,
and
a
large
oak
case
,
with
squares
cut
out
near
the
top
resembling
coach
windows
.
<EOS>
Having
approached
this
structure
,
I
looked
inside
,
and
perceived
it
to
be
a
singular
sort
of
old
-
fashioned
couch
,
very
conveniently
designed
to
obviate
the
necessity
for
every
member
of
the
family
having
a
room
to
himself
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
it
formed
a
little
closet
,
and
the
ledge
of
a
window
,
which
it
enclosed
,
served
as
a
table
.
<EOS>
I
slid
back
the
panelled
sides
,
got
in
with
my
light
,
pulled
them
together
again
,
and
felt
secure
against
the
vigilance
of
Heathcliff
,
and
every
one
else
.
  
<EOS>
The
ledge
,
where
I
placed
my
candle
,
had
a
few
mildewed
books
piled
up
in
one
corner
;
and
it
was
covered
with
writing
scratched
on
the
paint
.
<EOS>
This
writing
,
however
,
was
nothing
but
<EOS>
a
name
repeated
in
all
kinds
of
characters
,
large
and
small
 
_
Catherine
Earnshaw
_
,
here
and
there
varied
to
_
Catherine
Heathcliff
_
,
and
then
again
to
_
Catherine
Linton
_
.
  
<EOS>
In
vapid
listlessness
I
leant
my
head
against
the
window
,
and
continued
spelling
over
Catherine
Earnshaw
 
Heathcliff
 
Linton
,
till
my
eyes
closed
;
but
they
had
not
rested
five
minutes
when
a
glare
of
white
letters
started
from
the
dark
,
as
vivid
as
spectres
 
the
air
swarmed
with
Catherines
;
and
rousing
myself
to
dispel
the
obtrusive
name
,
I
discovered
my
candle
-
wick
reclining
on
one
of
the
antique
volumes
,
and
perfuming
the
place
with
an
odour
of
roasted
calf
-
skin
.
<EOS>
I
snuffed
it
off
,
and
,
very
ill
at
ease
under
the
influence
of
cold
and
lingering
nausea
,
sat
up
and
spread
open
the
injured
tome
on
my
knee
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
Testament
,
in
lean
type
,
and
smelling
dreadfully
musty
:
a
fly
-
leaf
bore
the
inscription
 
<EOS>
"
Catherine
Earnshaw
,
her
book
,
"
and
a
date
some
quarter
of
a
century
back
.
<EOS>
I
shut
it
,
and
took
up
another
and
another
,
till
I
had
examined
all
.
<EOS>
Catherine
's
library
was
select
,
and
its
state
of
dilapidation
proved
it
to
have
been
well
used
,
though
not
altogether
for
a
legitimate
purpose
:
scarcely
one
chapter
had
escaped
,
a
pen
-
and
-
ink
commentary
 
at
least
the
appearance
of
one
 
covering
every
morsel
of
blank
that
the
printer
had
left
.
<EOS>
Some
were
detached
sentences
;
other
parts
took
the
form
of
a
regular
diary
,
scrawled
in
an
unformed
,
childish
hand
.
<EOS>
At
the
top
of
an
extra
page
(
quite
a
treasure
,
probably
,
when
first
lighted
on
)
I
was
greatly
amused
to
behold
an
excellent
caricature
of
my
friend
Joseph
,
 
rudely
,
yet
powerfully
sketched
.
<EOS>
An
immediate
interest
kindled
within
me
for
the
unknown
Catherine
,
and
I
began
forthwith
to
decipher
her
faded
hieroglyphics
.
  
<EOS>
"
An
awful
Sunday
,
"
commenced
the
paragraph
beneath
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
my
father
were
back
again
.
<EOS>
Hindley
is
a
detestable
substitute
 
his
conduct
to
Heathcliff
is
atrocious
 
H.
<EOS>
and
I
are
going
to
rebel
 
<EOS>
we
took
our
initiatory
step
this
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
day
had
been
flooding
with
rain
;
we
could
not
go
to
church
,
so
<EOS>
Joseph
must
needs
get
up
a
congregation
in
the
garret
;
and
,
while
Hindley
and
his
wife
basked
downstairs
before
a
comfortable
fire
 
doing
anything
but
reading
their
Bibles
,
I
'll
answer
for
it
 
Heathcliff
,
myself
,
and
the
unhappy
ploughboy
were
commanded
to
take
our
prayer
-
books
,
and
mount
:
<EOS>
we
were
ranged
in
a
row
,
on
a
sack
of
corn
,
groaning
and
shivering
,
and
hoping
that
Joseph
would
shiver
too
,
so
that
he
might
give
us
a
short
homily
for
his
own
sake
.
<EOS>
A
vain
idea
!
<EOS>
The
service
lasted
precisely
three
hours
;
and
yet
my
brother
had
the
face
to
exclaim
,
when
he
saw
us
descending
,
"
What
,
done
already
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
Sunday
evenings
we
used
to
be
permitted
to
play
,
if
we
did
not
make
much
noise
;
now
a
mere
titter
is
sufficient
to
send
us
into
corners
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
You
forget
you
have
a
master
here
,
"
says
the
tyrant
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
demolish
the
first
who
puts
me
out
of
temper
!
<EOS>
I
insist
on
perfect
sobriety
and
silence
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
boy
!
<EOS>
was
that
you
?
<EOS>
Frances
darling
,
pull
his
hair
as
you
go
by
<EOS>
:
I
heard
him
snap
his
fingers
.
"
<EOS>
Frances
pulled
his
hair
heartily
,
and
then
went
and
seated
herself
on
her
husband
's
knee
,
and
there
they
were
,
like
two
babies
,
kissing
and
talking
nonsense
by
the
hour
 
foolish
palaver
that
we
should
be
ashamed
of
.
<EOS>
We
made
ourselves
as
snug
as
our
means
allowed
in
the
arch
of
the
dresser
.
<EOS>
I
had
just
fastened
our
pinafores
together
,
and
hung
them
up
for
a
curtain
,
when
in
comes
Joseph
,
on
an
errand
from
the
stables
.
<EOS>
He
tears
down
my
handiwork
,
boxes
my
ears
,
and
croaks
:
  
"
<EOS>
"
T
'
maister
nobbut
just
buried
,
and
Sabbath

o'ered
,

<EOS>
i

and

<EOS>
Shame

<EOS>

<EOS>
,

<EOS>
there

ye'll
read
'em
:
sit
ye
down
,
and
think
o
'
yer
sowls
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Saying
this
,
he
compelled
us
so
to
square
our
positions
that
we
might
receive
from
the
far
-
off
fire
a
dull
ray
to
show
us
the
text
of
the
lumber
he
thrust
upon
us
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
the
employment
.
<EOS>
I
took
my
dingy
volume
by
the
scroop
,
and
hurled
it
into
the
dog
-
kennel
,
vowing
I
hated
a
good
book
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
kicked
his
to
the
same
place
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
hubbub
!
  
<EOS>
"
"
Maister
Hindley
!
"
shouted
our
chaplain
.
<EOS>
"
Maister
,
coom
hither
!
<EOS>
Miss
Cathy
's
riven
th
'
 
back
off

Th

<EOS>
"
It
's
fair
flaysome
that
ye
let
'em
go
on
this
gait
.
<EOS>
Ech
!
<EOS>
th
'

<EOS>
but
he

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hindley
hurried
up
from
his
paradise
on
the
hearth
,
and
seizing
one
of
us
by
the
collar
,
and
the
other
by
the
arm
,
hurled
both
into
the
back
-
kitchen
<EOS>
;
where
,
Joseph
asseverated
,
"
owd
Nick
"
would
fetch
us
as
sure
as
we
were
living
:
and
,
so
comforted
,
we
each
sought
a
separate
nook
to
await
his
advent
.
<EOS>
I
reached
this
book
,
and
a
pot
of
ink
from
a
shelf
,
and
pushed
the
house
-
door
ajar
to
give
me
light
,
and
I
have
got
the
time
on
with
writing
for
twenty
minutes
;
but
my
companion
is
impatient
,
and
proposes
that
we
should
appropriate
the
dairywoman
's
cloak
,
and
have
a
scamper
on
the
moors
,
under
its
shelter
.
<EOS>
A
pleasant
suggestion
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
if
the
surly
old
man
come
in
,
he
may
believe
his
prophecy
verified
 
<EOS>
we
can
not
be
damper
,
or
colder
,
in
the
rain
than
we
are
here
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
I
suppose
Catherine
fulfilled
her
project
,
for
the
next
sentence
took
up
another
subject
:
she
waxed
lachrymose
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
little
did
I
dream
that
Hindley
would
ever
make
me
cry
so
!
<EOS>
"
she
wrote
.
<EOS>
"
My
head
aches
,
till
I
can
not
keep
it
on
the
pillow
;
and
still
I
ca
n't
give
over
.
<EOS>
Poor
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
Hindley
calls
him
a
vagabond
,
and
wo
n't
let
him
sit
with
us
,
nor
eat
with
us
any
more
;
and
,
he
says
,
he
and
I
must
not
play
together
,
and
threatens
to
turn
him
out
of
the
house
if
we
break
his
orders
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
blaming
our
father
(
how
dared
he
?
)
for
treating
H.
too
liberally
;
and
swears
he
will
reduce
him
to
his
right
place
 
<EOS>
"
     
I
began
to
nod
drowsily
over
the
dim
page
:
my
eye
wandered
from
manuscript
to
print
.
<EOS>
I
saw
a
red
ornamented
title
 
"
Seventy
Times
Seven
,
and
the
First
of
the
Seventy
-
First
.
<EOS>
A
Pious
Discourse
delivered
by
the
Reverend
Jabez
Branderham
,
in
the
Chapel
of
Gimmerden
Sough
.
"
<EOS>
And
while
I
was
,
half
-
consciously
,
worrying
my
brain
to
guess
what
Jabez
Branderham
would
make
of
his
subject
,
I
sank
back
in
bed
,
and
fell
asleep
.
<EOS>
Alas
,
for
the
effects
of
bad
tea
and
bad
temper
!
<EOS>
What
else
could
it
be
that
made
me
pass
such
a
terrible
night
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
remember
another
that
I
can
at
all
compare
with
it
since
I
was
capable
of
suffering
.
  
<EOS>
I
began
to
dream
,
almost
before
I
ceased
to
be
sensible
of
my
locality
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
morning
;
and
I
had
set
out
on
my
way
home
,
with
Joseph
for
a
guide
.
<EOS>
The
snow
lay
yards
deep
in
our
road
;
and
,
as
we
floundered
on
,
my
companion
wearied
me
with
constant
reproaches
that
I
had
not
brought
a
pilgrim
's
staff
:
telling
me
that
I
could
never
get
into
the
house
without
one
,
and
boastfully
flourishing
a
heavy
-
headed
cudgel
,
which
I
understood
to
be
so
denominated
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
I
considered
it
absurd
that
I
should
need
such
a
weapon
to
gain
admittance
into
my
own
residence
.
<EOS>
Then
a
new
idea
flashed
across
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
going
there
:
we
were
journeying
to
hear
the
famous
Jabez
Branderham
preach
,
from
the
text
 
"
Seventy
Times
Seven
;
"
and
either
Joseph
,
the
preacher
,
or
I
had
committed
the
"
First
of
the
Seventy
-
First
,
"
and
were
to
be
publicly
exposed
and
excommunicated
.
  
<EOS>
We
came
to
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
I
have
passed
it
really
in
my
walks
,
twice
or
thrice
;
it
lies
in
a
hollow
,
between
two
hills
:
an
elevated
hollow
,
near
a
swamp
,
whose
peaty
moisture
is
said
to
answer
all
the
purposes
of
embalming
on
the
few
corpses
deposited
there
.
<EOS>
The
roof
has
been
kept
whole
hitherto
;
but
as
the
clergyman
's
stipend
is
only
twenty
pounds
per
annum
,
and
a
house
with
two
rooms
,
threatening
speedily
to
determine
into
one
,
no
clergyman
will
undertake
the
duties
of
pastor
:
especially
as
it
is
currently
reported
that
his
flock
would
rather
let
him
starve
than
increase
the
living
by
one
penny
from
their
own
pockets
.
<EOS>
However
,
in
my
dream
,
Jabez
had
a
full
and
attentive
congregation
;
and
he
preached
 
good
God
!
<EOS>
what
a
sermon
;
divided
into
_
four
hundred
and
ninety
_
parts
,
each
fully
equal
to
an
ordinary
address
from
the
pulpit
,
and
each
discussing
a
separate
sin
!
<EOS>
Where
he
searched
for
them
,
I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
private
manner
of
interpreting
the
phrase
,
and
it
seemed
necessary
the
brother
should
sin
different
sins
on
every
occasion
.
<EOS>
They
were
of
the
most
curious
character
:
odd
transgressions
that
I
never
imagined
previously
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
weary
I
grow
.
<EOS>
How
I
writhed
,
and
yawned
,
and
nodded
,
and
revived
!
<EOS>
How
I
pinched
and
pricked
myself
,
and
rubbed
my
eyes
,
and
stood
up
,
and
sat
down
again
,
and
nudged
Joseph
to
inform
me
if
he
would
_
ever
_
have
done
.
<EOS>
I
was
condemned
to
hear
all
out
:
finally
,
he
reached
the
"
_
First
of
the
Seventy
-
First
_
.
"
<EOS>
At
that
crisis
,
a
sudden
inspiration
descended
on
me
;
I
was
moved
to
rise
and
denounce
Jabez
Branderham
as
the
sinner
of
the
sin
that
no
Christian
need
pardon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
I
exclaimed
,
"
sitting
here
within
these
four
walls
,
at
one
stretch
,
I
have
endured
and
forgiven
the
four
hundred
and
ninety
heads
of
your
discourse
.
<EOS>
Seventy
times
seven
times
have
I
plucked
up
my
hat
and
been
about
to
depart
 
Seventy
times
seven
times
<EOS>
have
you
preposterously
forced
me
to
resume
my
seat
.
<EOS>
The
four
hundred
and
ninety
-
first
is
too
much
.
<EOS>
Fellow
-
martyrs
,
have
at
him
!
<EOS>
Drag
him
down
,
and
crush
him
to
atoms
,
that
the
place
which
knows
him
may
know
him
no
more
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
Thou
art
the
Man
_
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jabez
,
after
a
solemn
pause
,
leaning
over
his
cushion
.
"
<EOS>
Seventy
times
seven
times
didst
<EOS>
thou
gapingly
contort
thy
visage
 
seventy
times
seven
<EOS>
did
I
take
counsel
with
my
soul
 
Lo
,
this
is
human
weakness
:
this
also
may
be
absolved
!
<EOS>
The
First
of
the
Seventy
-
First
is
come
.
<EOS>
Brethren
,
execute
upon
him
the
judgment
written
.
<EOS>
Such
honour
have
all
His
saints
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
concluding
word
,
the
whole
assembly
,
exalting
their
pilgrim
's
staves
,
rushed
round
me
in
a
body
;
and
I
,
having
no
weapon
to
raise
in
self
-
defence
,
commenced
grappling
with
Joseph
,
my
nearest
and
most
ferocious
assailant
,
for
his
.
<EOS>
In
the
confluence
of
the
multitude
,
several
clubs
crossed
;
blows
,
aimed
at
me
,
fell
on
other
sconces
.
<EOS>
Presently
the
whole
chapel
resounded
with
rappings
and
counter
rappings
:
every
man
's
hand
was
against
his
neighbour
;
and
Branderham
,
unwilling
to
remain
idle
,
poured
forth
his
zeal
in
a
shower
of
loud
taps
on
the
boards
of
the
pulpit
,
which
responded
so
smartly
that
,
at
last
,
to
my
unspeakable
relief
,
they
woke
me
.
<EOS>
And
what
was
it
that
had
suggested
the
tremendous
tumult
?
<EOS>
What
had
played
Jabez
's
part
in
the
row
?
<EOS>
Merely
the
branch
of
a
fir
-
tree
that
touched
my
lattice
as
the
blast
wailed
by
,
and
rattled
its
dry
cones
against
the
panes
!
<EOS>
I
listened
doubtingly
an
instant
;
detected
the
disturber
,
then
turned
and
dozed
,
and
dreamt
again
:
if
possible
,
still
more
disagreeably
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
This
time
,
I
remembered
I
was
lying
in
the
oak
closet
,
and
I
heard
distinctly
the
gusty
wind
,
and
the
driving
of
the
snow
;
I
heard
,
also
,
the
fir
bough
repeat
its
teasing
sound
,
and
ascribed
it
to
the
right
cause
:
but
it
annoyed
me
so
much
,
that
I
resolved
to
silence
it
,
if
possible
;
and
,
I
thought
,
I
rose
and
endeavoured
to
unhasp
the
casement
.
<EOS>
The
hook
was
soldered
into
the
staple
:
a
circumstance
observed
by
me
when
awake
,
but
forgotten
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
stop
it
,
nevertheless
!
"
I
muttered
,
knocking
my
knuckles
through
the
glass
,
and
stretching
an
arm
out
to
seize
the
importunate
branch
;
instead
of
which
,
my
fingers
closed
on
the
fingers
of
a
little
,
ice
-
cold
hand
!
<EOS>
The
intense
horror
of
nightmare
came
over
me
:
I
tried
to
draw
back
my
arm
,
but
the
hand
clung
to
it
,
and
a
most
melancholy
voice
sobbed
,
"
Let
me
in
 
let
me
in
!
"
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
I
asked
,
struggling
,
meanwhile
,
to
disengage
myself
.
"
<EOS>
Catherine
Linton
,
"
it
replied
,
shiveringly
(
why
did
I
think
of
_
Linton
_
?
<EOS>
I
had
read
_
Earnshaw
_
twenty
times
for
Linton
)
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
come
home
:
I
'd
lost
my
way
on
the
moor
!
"
<EOS>
As
it
spoke
,
I
discerned
,
obscurely
,
a
child
's
face
looking
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
Terror
made
me
cruel
;
and
,
finding
it
useless
to
attempt
shaking
the
creature
off
,
I
pulled
its
wrist
on
to
the
broken
pane
,
and
rubbed
it
to
and
fro
till
the
blood
ran
down
and
soaked
the
bedclothes
:
still
it
wailed
,
"
Let
me
in
!
"
and
maintained
its
tenacious
gripe
,
almost
maddening
me
with
fear
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
at
length
.
<EOS>
"
Let
_
me
<EOS>
_
go
,
if
you
want
me
to
let
you
in
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
fingers
relaxed
,
I
snatched
mine
through
the
hole
,
hurriedly
piled
the
books
up
in
a
pyramid
against
it
,
and
stopped
my
ears
to
exclude
the
lamentable
prayer
.
<EOS>
I
seemed
to
keep
them
closed
above
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
yet
,
the
instant
I
listened
again
,
there
was
the
doleful
cry
moaning
on
!
"
<EOS>
Begone
!
"
<EOS>
I
shouted
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
never
let
you
in
,
not
if
you
beg
for
twenty
years
.
"
<EOS>
"
It
is
twenty
years
,
"
mourned
the
voice
:
"
twenty
years
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
a
waif
for
twenty
years

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thereat
began
a
feeble
scratching
outside
,
and
the
pile
of
books
moved
as
if
thrust
forward
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
jump
up
;
but
could
not
stir
a
limb
;
and
so
yelled
aloud
,
in
a
frenzy
of
fright
.
<EOS>
To
my
confusion
,
I
discovered
the
yell
was
not
ideal
:
hasty
footsteps
approached
my
chamber
door
;
somebody
pushed
it
open
,
with
a
vigorous
hand
,
and
a
light
glimmered
through
the
squares
at
the
top
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
I
sat
shuddering
yet
,
and
wiping
the
perspiration
from
my
forehead
:
the
intruder
appeared
to
hesitate
,
and
muttered
to
himself
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
he
said
,
in
a
half
-
whisper
,
plainly
not
expecting
an
answer
,
"
Is
any
one
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
considered
it
best
to
confess
my
presence
;
for
I
knew
Heathcliff
's
accents
,
and
feared
he
might
search
further
,
if
I
kept
quiet
.
<EOS>
With
this
intention
,
I
turned
and
opened
the
panels
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
soon
forget
the
effect
my
action
produced
.
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
stood
near
the
entrance
,
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
;
with
a
candle
dripping
over
his
fingers
,
and
his
face
as
white
as
the
wall
behind
him
.
<EOS>
The
first
creak
of
the
oak
startled
him
like
an
electric
shock
:
the
light
leaped
from
his
hold
to
a
distance
of
some
feet
,
and
his
agitation
was
so
extreme
,
that
he
could
hardly
pick
it
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
only
your
guest
,
sir
,
"
I
called
out
,
desirous
to
spare
him
the
humiliation
of
exposing
his
cowardice
further
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
the
misfortune
to
scream
in
my
sleep
,
owing
to
a
frightful
nightmare
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
I
disturbed
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
God
confound
you
,
Mr.
Lockwood
!
<EOS>
I
wish
you
were
at
the
 
"
commenced
my
host
,
setting
the
candle
on
a
chair
,
because
he
found
it
impossible
to
hold
it
steady
.
"
<EOS>
And
who
showed
you
up
into
this
room
?
<EOS>
"
he
continued
,
crushing
his
nails
into
his
palms
,
and
grinding
his
teeth
to
subdue
the
maxillary
convulsions
.
<EOS>
"
Who
was
it
?
<EOS>
I
've
a
good
mind
to
turn
them
out
of
the
house
this
moment
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
your
servant
Zillah
,
"
I
replied
,
flinging
myself
on
to
the
floor
,
and
rapidly
resuming
my
garments
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
care
if
you
did
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
;
she
richly
deserves
it
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
she
wanted
to
get
another
proof
that
the
place
was
haunted
,
at
my
expense
.
<EOS>
Well
,
it
is
 
swarming
with
ghosts
and
goblins
!
<EOS>
You
have
reason
in
shutting
it
up
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
No
one
will
thank
you
for
a
doze
in
such
a
den
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
asked
Heathcliff
,
"
and
what
are
you
doing
?
<EOS>
Lie
down
and
finish
out
the
night
,
since
you
_
are
_
here
;
but
,
for
heaven
's
sake
!
<EOS>
do
n't
repeat
that
horrid
noise
:
nothing
could
excuse
it
,
unless
you
were
having
your
throat
cut
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
the
little
fiend
had
got
in
at
the
window
,
she
probably
would
have
strangled
me
!
<EOS>
"
I
returned
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
going
to
endure
the
persecutions
of
your
hospitable
ancestors
again
.
<EOS>
Was
not
the
Reverend
Jabez
Branderham
akin
to
you
on
the
mother
's
side
?
<EOS>
And
that
minx
,
Catherine
Linton
,
or
Earnshaw
,
or
however
she
was
called
 
<EOS>
she
must
have
been
a
changeling
 
wicked
little
soul
!
<EOS>
She
told
me
she
had
been
walking
the
earth
these
twenty
years
:
<EOS>
a
just
punishment
for
her
mortal
transgressions
<EOS>
,
I
've
no
doubt
!
"
  
<EOS>
Scarcely
were
these
words
uttered
when
I
recollected
the
association
of
Heathcliff
's
with
Catherine
's
name
in
the
book
,
which
had
completely
slipped
from
my
memory
,
till
thus
awakened
.
<EOS>
I
blushed
at
my
inconsideration
:
but
,
without
showing
further
consciousness
of
the
offence
,
I
hastened
to
add
 
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
sir
,
I
passed
the
first
part
of
the
night
in
 
<EOS>
"
Here
I
stopped
afresh
 
<EOS>
I
was
about
to
say
"
perusing
those
old
volumes
,
"
then
it
would
have
revealed
my
knowledge
of
their
written
,
as
well
as
their
printed
,
contents
;
so
,
correcting
myself
,
I
went
on
 
"
in
spelling
over
the
name
scratched
on
that
window
-
ledge
.
<EOS>
A
monotonous
occupation
,
calculated
to
set
me
asleep
,
like
counting
,
or
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
_
<EOS>
can
_
<EOS>
you
mean
by
talking
in
this
way
to
_
me
_
!
<EOS>
"
thundered
Heathcliff
with
savage
vehemence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
 
how
_
dare
<EOS>
_
you
,
under
my
roof
?
 
<EOS>
God
!
<EOS>
he
's
mad
to
speak
so
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
struck
his
forehead
with
rage
.
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
whether
to
resent
this
language
or
pursue
my
explanation
;
but
he
seemed
so
powerfully
affected
that
I
took
pity
and
proceeded
with
my
dreams
;
affirming
I
had
never
heard
the
appellation
of
"
Catherine
Linton
"
before
,
but
reading
it
often
over
produced
an
impression
which
personified
itself
when
I
had
no
longer
my
imagination
under
control
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
gradually
fell
back
into
the
shelter
of
the
bed
,
as
I
spoke
;
finally
sitting
down
almost
concealed
behind
it
.
<EOS>
I
guessed
,
however
,
by
his
irregular
and
intercepted
breathing
,
that
he
struggled
to
vanquish
an
excess
of
violent
emotion
.
<EOS>
Not
liking
to
show
him
that
I
had
heard
the
conflict
,
I
continued
my
toilette
rather
noisily
,
looked
at
my
watch
,
and
soliloquised
on
the
length
of
the
night
:
"
Not
three
o'clock
yet
!
<EOS>
I
could
have
taken
oath
<EOS>
it
had
been
six
.
<EOS>
Time
stagnates
here
:
we
must
surely
have
retired
to
rest
at
eight
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Always
at
nine
in
winter
,
and
rise
at
four
,
"
said
my
host
,
suppressing
a
groan
:
<EOS>
and
,
as
I
fancied
,
by
the
motion
of
his
arm
's
shadow
,
dashing
a
tear
from
his
eyes
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Lockwood
,
"
he
added
,
"
you
may
go
into
my
room
:
you
'll
only
be
in
the
way
,
coming
down
-
stairs
so
early
:
and
your
childish
outcry
has
sent
sleep
to
the
devil
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
for
me
,
too
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
walk
in
the
yard
till
daylight
,
and
then
I
'll
be
off
;
and
you
need
not
dread
a
repetition
of
my
intrusion
.
<EOS>
I
'm
now
quite
cured
of
seeking
pleasure
in
society
,
be
it
country
or
town
.
<EOS>
A
sensible
man
ought
to
find
sufficient
company
in
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Delightful
company
!
"
muttered
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
Take
the
candle
,
and
go
where
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
shall
join
you
directly
.
<EOS>
Keep
out
of
the
yard
,
though
,
the
dogs
are
unchained
;
and
the
house
 
Juno
mounts
sentinel
there
,
and
 
nay
,
you
can
only
ramble
about
the
steps
and
passages
.
<EOS>
But
,
away
with
you
!
<EOS>
I
'll
come
in
two
minutes
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
obeyed
,
so
far
as
to
quit
the
chamber
;
when
,
ignorant
where
the
narrow
lobbies
led
,
I
stood
still
,
and
was
witness
,
involuntarily
,
to
a
piece
of
superstition
on
the
part
of
my
landlord
which
belied
,
oddly
,
his
apparent
sense
.
<EOS>
He
got
on
to
the
bed
,
and
wrenched
open
the
lattice
,
bursting
,
as
he
pulled
at
it
,
into
an
uncontrollable
passion
of
tears
.
<EOS>
"
Come
in
!
<EOS>
come
in
!
"
<EOS>
he
sobbed
.
<EOS>
"
Cathy
,
do
come
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
do
 
_
once
_
more
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
heart
's
darling
!
<EOS>
hear
me
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
this
_
time
,
Catherine
,
at
last
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
spectre
showed
a
spectre
's
ordinary
caprice
:
it
gave
no
sign
of
being
;
but
the
snow
and
wind
whirled
wildly
through
,
even
reaching
my
station
,
and
blowing
out
the
light
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
such
anguish
in
the
gush
of
grief
that
accompanied
this
raving
,
that
my
compassion
made
me
overlook
its
folly
,
and
I
drew
off
,
half
angry
to
have
listened
at
all
,
and
vexed
at
having
related
my
ridiculous
nightmare
,
since
it
produced
that
agony
;
though
_
why
_
was
beyond
my
comprehension
.
<EOS>
I
descended
cautiously
to
the
lower
regions
,
and
landed
in
the
back
-
kitchen
,
where
a
gleam
of
fire
,
raked
compactly
together
,
enabled
me
to
rekindle
my
candle
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
stirring
except
a
brindled
,
grey
cat
,
which
crept
from
the
ashes
,
and
saluted
me
with
a
querulous
mew
.
  
<EOS>
Two
benches
,
shaped
in
sections
of
a
circle
,
nearly
enclosed
the
hearth
;
on
one
of
these
I
stretched
myself
,
and
Grimalkin
mounted
the
other
.
<EOS>
We
were
both
of
us
<EOS>
nodding
ere
<EOS>
any
one
invaded
our
retreat
,
and
then
it
was
Joseph
,
shuffling
down
a
wooden
ladder
that
vanished
in
the
roof
,
through
a
trap
:
the
ascent
to
his
garret
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
He
cast
a
sinister
look
at
the
little
flame
which
I
had
enticed
to
play
between
the
ribs
,
swept
the
cat
from
its
elevation
,
and
bestowing
himself
in
the
vacancy
,
commenced
the
operation
of
stuffing
a
three
-
inch
pipe
with
tobacco
.
<EOS>
My
presence
in
his
sanctum
was
evidently
esteemed
a
piece
of
impudence
too
shameful
for
remark
:
he
silently
applied
the
tube
to
his
lips
,
folded
his
arms
,
and
puffed
away
.
<EOS>
I
let
him
enjoy
the
luxury
unannoyed
;
and
after
sucking
out
his
last
wreath
,
and
heaving
a
profound
sigh
,
he
got
up
,
and
departed
as
solemnly
as
he
came
.
  
<EOS>
A
more
elastic
footstep
entered
next
;
and
now
I
opened
my
mouth
for
a
"
good
-
morning
,
"
but
closed
it
again
,
the
salutation
unachieved
;
for
Hareton
Earnshaw
was
performing
his
orison
_
sotto
voce
_
,
in
a
series
of
curses
directed
against
every
object
he
touched
,
while
he
rummaged
a
corner
for
a
spade
or
shovel
to
dig
through
the
drifts
.
<EOS>
He
glanced
over
the
back
of
the
bench
,
dilating
his
nostrils
,
and
thought
as
little
of
exchanging
civilities
with
me
as
with
my
companion
the
cat
.
<EOS>
I
guessed
,
by
his
preparations
,
that
egress
was
allowed
,
and
,
leaving
my
hard
couch
,
made
a
movement
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
He
noticed
this
,
and
thrust
at
an
inner
door
with
the
end
of
his
spade
,
intimating
by
an
inarticulate
sound
that
there
was
the
place
where
I
must
go
,
if
I
changed
my
locality
.
  
<EOS>
It
opened
into
the
house
,
where
the
females
were
already
astir
;
<EOS>
Zillah
urging
flakes
of
flame
up
the
chimney
with
a
colossal
bellows
;
and
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
kneeling
on
the
hearth
,
reading
a
book
by
the
aid
of
the
blaze
.
<EOS>
She
held
her
hand
interposed
between
the
furnace
-
heat
and
her
eyes
,
and
seemed
absorbed
in
her
occupation
;
desisting
from
it
only
to
chide
the
servant
for
covering
her
with
sparks
,
or
to
push
away
a
dog
,
now
and
then
,
that
snoozled
its
nose
overforwardly
into
her
face
.
<EOS>
I
was
surprised
to
see
Heathcliff
there
also
.
<EOS>
He
stood
by
the
fire
,
his
back
towards
me
,
just
finishing
a
stormy
scene
with
poor
Zillah
;
who
ever
and
anon
interrupted
her
labour
to
pluck
up
the
corner
of
her
apron
,
and
heave
an
indignant
groan
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
,
you
worthless
 
"
he
broke
out
as
I
entered
,
turning
to
his
daughter
-
in
-
law
,
and
employing
an
epithet
as
harmless
as
duck
,
or
sheep
,
but
generally
represented
by
a
dash
 
.
<EOS>
"
There
you
are
,
at
your
idle
tricks
again
!
<EOS>
The
rest
of
them
do
earn
their
bread
 
<EOS>
you
live
on
my
charity
!
<EOS>
Put
your
trash
away
,
and
find
something
to
do
.
<EOS>
You
shall
pay
me
for
the
plague
of
having
you
eternally
in
my
sight
 
<EOS>
do
you
hear
,
damnable
jade
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
put
my
trash
away
,
because
you
can
make
me
if
I
refuse
,
"
answered
the
young
lady
,
closing
her
book
,
and
throwing
it
on
a
chair
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
'll
not
do
anything
,
though
you
should
swear
your
tongue
out
,
except
what
I
please
!
"
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
lifted
his
hand
,
and
the
speaker
sprang
to
a
safer
distance
,
obviously
acquainted
with
its
weight
.
<EOS>
Having
no
desire
to
be
entertained
by
a
cat
-
and
-
dog
combat
,
I
stepped
forward
briskly
,
as
if
eager
to
partake
the
warmth
of
the
hearth
,
and
innocent
of
any
knowledge
of
the
interrupted
dispute
.
<EOS>
Each
had
enough
decorum
to
suspend
further
hostilities
:
Heathcliff
placed
his
fists
,
out
of
temptation
,
in
his
pockets
;
Mrs.
Heathcliff
curled
her
lip
,
and
walked
to
a
seat
far
off
,
where
she
kept
her
word
by
playing
the
part
of
a
statue
during
the
remainder
of
my
stay
.
<EOS>
That
was
not
long
.
<EOS>
I
declined
joining
their
breakfast
,
and
,
at
the
first
gleam
of
dawn
,
took
an
opportunity
of
escaping
into
the
free
air
,
now
clear
,
and
still
,
and
cold
as
impalpable
ice
.
  
<EOS>
My
landlord
halloed
for
me
to
stop
ere
<EOS>
I
reached
the
bottom
of
the
garden
,
and
offered
to
accompany
me
across
the
moor
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
he
did
,
for
the
whole
hill
-
back
was
one
billowy
,
white
ocean
;
the
swells
and
falls
not
indicating
corresponding
rises
and
depressions
in
the
ground
:
<EOS>
many
pits
,
at
least
,
were
filled
to
a
level
;
and
entire
ranges
of
mounds
,
the
refuse
of
the
quarries
,
blotted
from
the
chart
which
my
yesterday
's
walk
left
pictured
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
had
remarked
on
one
side
of
the
road
,
at
intervals
of
six
or
seven
yards
,
a
line
of
upright
stones
,
continued
through
the
whole
length
of
the
barren
:
these
were
erected
and
daubed
with
lime
on
purpose
to
serve
as
guides
in
the
dark
,
and
also
when
a
fall
,
like
the
present
,
confounded
the
deep
swamps
on
either
hand
with
the
firmer
path
:
but
,
excepting
a
dirty
dot
pointing
up
here
and
there
,
all
traces
of
their
existence
had
vanished
:
and
my
companion
found
it
necessary
to
warn
me
frequently
to
steer
to
the
right
or
left
,
<EOS>
when
I
imagined
I
was
following
,
correctly
,
the
windings
of
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
We
exchanged
little
conversation
,
and
he
halted
at
the
entrance
of
Thrushcross
Park
,
saying
,
I
could
make
no
error
there
.
<EOS>
Our
adieux
were
limited
to
a
hasty
bow
,
and
then
I
pushed
forward
,
trusting
to
my
own
resources
;
for
the
porter
's
lodge
is
untenanted
as
yet
.
<EOS>
The
distance
from
the
gate
to
the
grange
is
two
miles
;
I
believe
I
managed
to
make
it
four
,
<EOS>
what
with
losing
myself
among
the
trees
,
and
sinking
up
to
the
neck
in
snow
:
<EOS>
a
predicament
which
only
those
who
have
experienced
it
can
appreciate
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
whatever
were
my
wanderings
,
the
clock
chimed
twelve
as
I
entered
the
house
;
and
that
gave
exactly
an
hour
for
every
mile
of
the
usual
way
from
Wuthering
Heights
.
  
<EOS>
My
human
fixture
and
her
satellites
rushed
to
welcome
me
;
exclaiming
,
tumultuously
<EOS>
,
they
had
completely
given
me
up
:
everybody
conjectured
that
I
perished
last
night
;
and
they
were
wondering
how
they
must
set
about
the
search
for
my
remains
.
<EOS>
I
bid
them
be
quiet
,
now
that
they
saw
me
returned
,
and
,
benumbed
to
my
very
heart
<EOS>
,
I
dragged
up
-
stairs
;
whence
,
after
putting
on
dry
clothes
,
and
pacing
to
and
fro
thirty
or
forty
minutes
,
to
restore
the
animal
heat
,
I
adjourned
to
my
study
,
feeble
as
a
kitten
:
almost
too
much
so
to
enjoy
the
cheerful
fire
and
smoking
coffee
which
the
servant
had
prepared
for
my
refreshment
.
    
<EOS>
What
vain
weathercocks
we
are
!
<EOS>
I
,
who
had
determined
to
hold
myself
independent
of
all
social
intercourse
,
and
thanked
my
stars
that
,
at
length
,
I
had
lighted
on
a
spot
where
it
was
next
to
impracticable
 
I
,
weak
wretch
,
after
maintaining
till
dusk
a
struggle
with
low
spirits
and
solitude
,
was
finally
compelled
to
strike
my
colours
;
and
under
pretence
of
gaining
information
concerning
the
necessities
of
my
establishment
,
I
desired
Mrs.
Dean
,
when
she
brought
in
supper
,
to
sit
down
while
I
ate
it
;
hoping
sincerely
she
would
prove
a
regular
gossip
,
and
either
rouse
me
to
animation
or
lull
me
to
sleep
by
her
talk
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
lived
here
a
considerable
time
,
"
I
commenced
;
"
did
you
not
say
sixteen
years
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eighteen
,
sir
:
<EOS>
I
came
when
the
mistress
was
married
,
to
wait
on
her
;
after
she
died
,
the
master
retained
me
for
his
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
ensued
a
pause
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
a
gossip
,
I
feared
;
unless
about
her
own
affairs
,
and
those
could
hardly
interest
me
.
<EOS>
However
,
having
studied
for
an
interval
,
with
a
fist
on
either
knee
,
and
a
cloud
of
meditation
over
her
ruddy
countenance
,
she
ejaculated
 
"
Ah
,
times
are
greatly
changed
since
then
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
remarked
,
"
you
've
seen
a
good
many
alterations
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
:
and
troubles
too
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
'll
turn
the
talk
on
my
landlord
's
family
!
<EOS>
"
I
thought
to
myself
.
"
<EOS>
A
good
subject
to
start
!
<EOS>
And
that
pretty
girl
-
widow
,
I
should
like
to
know
her
history
:
whether
she
be
a
native
of
the
country
,
or
,
as
is
more
probable
,
an
exotic
that
the
surly
_
indigenae
_
will
not
recognise
for
kin
.
"
<EOS>
With
this
intention
I
asked
Mrs.
Dean
why
Heathcliff
let
Thrushcross
Grange
,
and
preferred
living
in
a
situation
and
residence
so
much
inferior
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
he
not
rich
enough
to
keep
the
estate
in
good
order
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rich
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
she
returned
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
nobody
knows
what
money
,
and
every
year
it
increases
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
he
's
rich
enough
to
live
in
a
finer
house
than
this
:
but
he
's
very
near
 
close
-
handed
;
and
,
if
he
had
meant
to
flit
to
Thrushcross
Grange
,
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
a
good
tenant
he
could
not
have
borne
to
miss
the
chance
of
getting
a
few
hundreds
more
.
<EOS>
It
is
strange
people
should
be
so
greedy
,
when
they
are
alone
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
had
a
son
,
it
seems
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
had
one
 
<EOS>
he
is
dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
that
young
lady
,
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
is
his
widow
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
did
she
come
from
originally
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
she
is
my
late
master
's
daughter
:
<EOS>
Catherine
Linton
was
her
maiden
name
.
<EOS>
I
nursed
her
,
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
I
did
wish
Mr.
Heathcliff
would
remove
here
,
and
then
we
might
have
been
together
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
Catherine
Linton
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
,
astonished
.
<EOS>
But
a
minute
's
reflection
convinced
me
it
was
not
my
ghostly
Catherine
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
"
I
continued
,
"
my
predecessor
's
name
was
Linton
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
is
that
Earnshaw
:
Hareton
Earnshaw
,
who
lives
with
Mr.
Heathcliff
?
<EOS>
Are
they
relations
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
he
is
the
late
Mrs.
Linton
's
nephew
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
young
lady
's
cousin
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
and
her
husband
was
her
cousin
also
:
one
on
the
mother
's
,
the
other
on
the
father
's
side
<EOS>
:
Heathcliff
married
Mr.
Linton
's
sister
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
the
house
at
Wuthering
Heights
has
"
Earnshaw
"
carved
over
the
front
door
.
<EOS>
Are
they
an
old
family
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Very
old
,
sir
;
and
Hareton
is
the
last
of
them
,
as
our
Miss
Cathy
is
of
us
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
of
the
Lintons
.
<EOS>
Have
you
been
to
Wuthering
Heights
?
<EOS>
I
beg
pardon
for
asking
;
but
I
should
like
to
hear
how
she
is
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Heathcliff
?
<EOS>
she
looked
very
well
,
and
very
handsome
;
yet
,
I
think
,
not
very
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
I
do
n't
wonder
!
<EOS>
And
how
did
you
like
the
master
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
rough
fellow
,
rather
,
Mrs.
Dean
.
<EOS>
Is
not
that
his
character
?
  
<EOS>
"
Rough
as
a
saw
-
edge
,
and
hard
as
whinstone
!
<EOS>
The
less
you
meddle
with
him
the
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
must
have
had
some
ups
and
downs
in
life
to
make
him
such
a
churl
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
anything
of
his
history
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
cuckoo
's
,
sir
 
<EOS>
I
know
all
about
it
:
except
where
he
was
born
,
and
who
were
his
parents
,
and
how
he
got
his
money
at
first
.
<EOS>
And
Hareton
has
been
cast
out
like
an
unfledged
dunnock
!
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
lad
is
the
only
one
in
all
this
parish
that
does
not
guess
how
he
has
been
cheated
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mrs.
Dean
,
it
will
be
a
charitable
deed
to
tell
me
something
of
my
neighbours
:
<EOS>
I
feel
I
shall
not
rest
if
I
go
to
bed
;
so
be
good
enough
to
sit
and
chat
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I
'll
just
fetch
a
little
sewing
,
and
then
I
'll
sit
as
long
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
But
you
've
caught
cold
<EOS>
:
I
saw
you
shivering
,
and
you
must
have
some
gruel
to
drive
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
worthy
woman
bustled
off
,
and
I
crouched
nearer
the
fire
;
my
head
felt
hot
,
and
the
rest
of
me
chill
:
<EOS>
moreover
,
I
was
excited
,
almost
to
a
pitch
of
foolishness
,
through
my
nerves
and
brain
.
<EOS>
This
caused
me
to
feel
,
not
uncomfortable
,
but
rather
fearful
(
as
I
am
still
)
of
serious
effects
from
the
incidents
of
to
-
day
and
yesterday
.
<EOS>
She
returned
presently
,
bringing
a
smoking
basin
and
a
basket
of
work
;
and
,
having
placed
the
former
on
the
hob
,
drew
in
her
seat
,
evidently
pleased
to
find
me
so
companionable
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
came
to
live
here
,
she
commenced
 
waiting
no
farther
invitation
to
her
story
 
<EOS>
I
was
almost
always
at
Wuthering
Heights
;
because
my
mother
had
nursed
Mr.
Hindley
Earnshaw
,
that
was
Hareton
's
father
,
and
I
got
used
to
playing
with
the
children
<EOS>
:
I
ran
errands
too
,
and
helped
to
make
hay
,
and
hung
about
the
farm
ready
for
anything
that
anybody
would
set
me
to
.
<EOS>
One
fine
summer
morning
 
<EOS>
it
was
the
beginning
of
harvest
,
I
remember
 
Mr.
Earnshaw
,
the
old
master
,
came
down
-
stairs
,
dressed
for
a
journey
;
and
,
after
he
had
told
Joseph
what
was
to
be
done
during
the
day
,
he
turned
to
Hindley
,
and
Cathy
,
and
me
 
<EOS>
for
<EOS>
I
sat
eating
my
porridge
with
them
 
<EOS>
and
he
said
,
speaking
to
his
son
,
"
Now
,
my
bonny
man
,
I
'm
going
to
Liverpool
to
-
day
,
what
shall
I
bring
you
?
<EOS>
You
may
choose
what
you
like
:
only
let
it
be
little
,
for
I
shall
walk
there
and
back
:
sixty
miles
each
way
<EOS>
,
that
is
a
long
spell
!
"
<EOS>
Hindley
named
a
fiddle
,
and
then
he
asked
Miss
Cathy
;
she
was
hardly
six
years
old
,
but
she
could
ride
any
horse
in
the
stable
,
and
she
chose
a
whip
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
forget
me
;
for
he
had
a
kind
heart
,
though
he
was
rather
severe
sometimes
.
<EOS>
He
promised
to
bring
me
a
pocketful
of
apples
and
pears
,
and
then
he
kissed
his
children
,
said
good
-
bye
,
and
set
off
.
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
a
long
while
to
us
all
 
the
three
days
of
his
absence
 
and
often
did
little
Cathy
ask
when
he
would
be
home
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Earnshaw
expected
him
by
supper
-
time
on
the
third
evening
,
and
she
put
the
meal
off
hour
after
hour
;
there
were
no
signs
of
his
coming
,
however
,
and
at
last
the
children
got
tired
of
running
down
to
the
gate
to
look
.
<EOS>
Then
it
grew
dark
;
she
would
have
had
them
to
bed
,
but
they
begged
sadly
to
be
allowed
to
stay
up
;
and
,
just
about
eleven
o'clock
,
<EOS>
the
door
-
latch
was
raised
quietly
,
and
in
stepped
the
master
.
<EOS>
He
threw
himself
into
a
chair
,
laughing
and
groaning
,
and
bid
them
all
stand
off
,
for
he
was
nearly
killed
 
he
would
not
have
such
another
walk
for
the
three
kingdoms
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
at
the
end
of
it
to
be
flighted
to
death
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
opening
his
great
-
coat
,
which
he
held
bundled
up
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
"
See
here
,
wife
!
<EOS>
I
was
never
so
beaten
with
anything
in
my
life
:
but
you
must
e'en
take
it
as
a
gift
of
God
;
though
it
's
as
dark
almost
as
if
it
came
from
the
devil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
crowded
round
,
and
over
Miss
Cathy
's
head
I
had
a
peep
at
a
dirty
,
ragged
,
black
-
haired
child
;
big
enough
both
to
walk
and
talk
:
indeed
,
its
face
looked
older
than
Catherine
's
;
yet
when
it
was
set
on
its
feet
,
it
only
stared
round
,
and
repeated
over
and
over
again
some
gibberish
that
nobody
could
understand
.
<EOS>
I
was
frightened
,
and
Mrs.
Earnshaw
was
ready
to
fling
it
out
of
doors
:
she
did
fly
up
,
asking
how
he
could
fashion
to
bring
that
gipsy
brat
into
the
house
,
when
they
had
their
own
bairns
to
feed
and
fend
for
?
<EOS>
What
he
meant
to
do
with
it
,
and
whether
he
were
mad
?
<EOS>
The
master
tried
to
explain
the
matter
;
but
he
was
really
half
dead
with
fatigue
,
and
all
that
I
could
make
out
,
amongst
her
scolding
,
was
a
tale
of
his
seeing
it
starving
,
and
houseless
,
and
as
good
as
dumb
,
in
the
streets
of
Liverpool
,
where
he
picked
it
up
and
inquired
for
its
owner
.
<EOS>
Not
a
soul
knew
to
whom
it
belonged
,
he
said
;
and
his
money
and
time
being
both
limited
,
he
thought
it
better
to
take
it
home
with
him
at
once
,
than
run
into
vain
expenses
there
:
because
he
was
determined
he
would
not
leave
it
as
he
found
it
.
<EOS>
Well
,
the
conclusion
was
,
that
my
mistress
grumbled
herself
calm
;
and
Mr.
Earnshaw
told
me
to
wash
it
,
and
give
it
clean
things
,
and
let
it
sleep
with
the
children
.
  
<EOS>
Hindley
and
Cathy
contented
themselves
with
looking
and
listening
till
peace
was
restored
:
then
,
both
began
searching
their
father
's
pockets
for
the
presents
he
had
promised
them
.

The
former
was
a
boy
of
fourteen
,
but
when
he
drew
out
what
had
been
a
fiddle
,
crushed
to
morsels
in
the
great
-
coat
,
he
blubbered
aloud
;
and
Cathy
,
when
she
learned
the
master
had
lost
her
whip
in
attending
on
the
stranger
,
showed
her
humour
by
grinning
and
spitting
at
the
stupid
little
thing
;
earning
for
her
pains
a
sound
blow
from
her
father
,
to
teach
her
cleaner
manners
.
<EOS>
They
entirely
refused
to
have
it
in
bed
with
them
,
or
even
in
their
room
;
and
I
had
no
more
sense
,
so
I
put
it
on
the
landing
of
the
stairs
,
hoping
it
might
be
gone
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
By
chance
,
or
else
attracted
by
hearing
his
voice
,
it
crept
to
Mr.
Earnshaw
's
door
,
and
there
he
found
it
on
quitting
his
chamber
.
<EOS>
Inquiries
were
made
as
to
how
it
got
there
;
I
was
obliged
to
confess
,
and
in
recompense
for
my
cowardice
and
inhumanity
was
sent
out
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
Heathcliff
's
first
introduction
to
the
family
.
<EOS>
On
coming
back
a
few
days
afterwards
(
for
I
did
not
consider
my
banishment
perpetual
)
,
I
found
they
had
christened
him
"
Heathcliff
"
:
it
was
the
name
of
a
son
who
died
in
childhood
,
and
it
has
served
him
ever
since
,
both
for
Christian
and
surname
.
<EOS>
Miss
Cathy
<EOS>
and
he
were
now
very
thick
;
but
Hindley
hated
him
:
and
to
say
the
truth
I
did
the
same
;
and
we
plagued
and
went
on
with
him
shamefully
:
for
I
was
n't
reasonable
enough
to
feel
my
injustice
,
and
the
mistress
never
put
in
a
word
on
his
behalf
when
she
saw
him
wronged
.
  
<EOS>
He
seemed
a
sullen
,
patient
child
;
hardened
,
perhaps
,
to
ill
-
treatment
:
he
would
stand
Hindley
's
blows
without
winking
or
shedding
a
tear
,
and
my
pinches
moved
him
only
to
draw
in
a
breath
and
open
his
eyes
,
as
if
he
had
hurt
himself
by
accident
,
and
nobody
was
to
blame
.
<EOS>
This
endurance
made
old
Earnshaw
furious
,
when
he
discovered
his
son
persecuting
the
poor
fatherless
child
,
as
he
called
him
.
<EOS>
He
took
to
Heathcliff
strangely
,
believing
all
he
said
(
for
that
matter
,
he
said
precious
little
,
and
generally
the
truth
)
,
and
petting
him
up
far
above
Cathy
,
who
was
too
mischievous
and
wayward
for
a
favourite
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
from
the
very
beginning
,
he
bred
bad
feeling
in
the
house
;
and
at
Mrs.
Earnshaw
's
death
,
which
happened
in
less
than
two
years
after
,
the
young
master
had
learned
to
regard
his
father
as
an
oppressor
rather
than
a
friend
,
and
Heathcliff
as
a
usurper
of
his
parent
's
affections
and
his
privileges
;
and
he
grew
bitter
with
brooding
over
these
injuries
.
<EOS>
I
sympathised
a
while
;
but
when
the
children
fell
ill
of
the
measles
,
and
I
had
to
tend
them
,
and
take
on
me
the
cares
of
a
woman
at
once
,
I
changed
my
idea
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
was
dangerously
sick
;
and
while
he
lay
at
the
worst
he
would
have
me
constantly
by
his
pillow
:
I
suppose
he
felt
I
did
a
good
deal
for
him
,
and
he
had
n't
wit
to
guess
that
I
was
compelled
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
will
say
this
,
he
was
the
quietest
child
that
ever
nurse
watched
over
.
<EOS>
The
difference
between
him
and
the
others
forced
me
to
be
less
partial
.
<EOS>
Cathy
and
her
brother
harassed
me
terribly
:
he
was
as
uncomplaining
as
a
lamb
;
though
hardness
,
not
gentleness
,
made
him
give
little
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
He
got
through
,
and
the
doctor
affirmed
it
was
in
a
great
measure
owing
to
me
,
and
praised
me
for
my
care
.
<EOS>
I
was
vain
of
his
commendations
,
and
softened
towards
the
being
by
whose
means
I
earned
them
,
and
thus
Hindley
lost
his
last
ally
:
still
I
could
n't
dote
on
Heathcliff
,
and
I
wondered
often
what
my
master
saw
to
admire
so
much
in
the
sullen
boy
;
who
never
,
to
my
recollection
,
repaid
his
indulgence
by
any
sign
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
insolent
to
his
benefactor
,
he
was
simply
insensible
;
though
knowing
perfectly
the
hold
he
had
on
his
heart
,
and
conscious
he
had
only
to
speak
and
all
the
house
would
be
obliged
to
bend
to
his
wishes
.
<EOS>
As
an
instance
,
I
remember
Mr.
Earnshaw
once
bought
a
couple
of
colts
at
the
parish
fair
,
and
gave
the
lads
each
one
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
took
the
handsomest
,
but
it
soon
fell
lame
,
and
when
he
discovered
it
,
he
said
to
Hindley
    
<EOS>
"
You
must
exchange
horses
with
me
:
I
do
n't
like
mine
;
and
if
you
wo
n't
I
shall
tell
your
father
of
the
three
thrashings
you
've
given
me
this
week
,
and
show
him
my
arm
,
which
is
black
to
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hindley
put
out
his
tongue
,
and
cuffed
him
over
the
ears
.
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
do
it
at
once
,
"
he
persisted
,
escaping
to
the
porch
(
they
were
in
the
stable
)
:
"
you
will
have
to
:
<EOS>
and
if
I
speak
of
these
blows
,
you
'll
get
them
again
with
interest
.
"
<EOS>
"
Off
,
dog
!
"
cried
Hindley
,
threatening
him
with
an
iron
weight
used
for
weighing
potatoes
and
hay
.
"
<EOS>
Throw
it
,
"
he
replied
,
standing
still
,
"
and
then
I
'll
tell
how
you
boasted
that
you
would
turn
me
out
of
doors
as
soon
as
he
died
,
and
see
whether
he
will
not
turn
you
out
directly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hindley
threw
it
,
hitting
him
on
the
breast
,
and
down
he
fell
,
but
staggered
up
immediately
,
breathless
and
white
;
and
,
had
not
I
prevented
it
,
he
would
have
gone
just
so
to
the
master
,
and
got
full
revenge
by
letting
his
condition
plead
for
him
,
intimating
who
had
caused
it
.
<EOS>
"
Take
my
colt
,
Gipsy
,
then
!
"
said
young
Earnshaw
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
pray
that
he
may
break
your
neck
:
take
him
,
and
be
damned
,
you
beggarly
interloper
!
<EOS>
and
wheedle
my
father
out
of
all
he
has
<EOS>
:
only
afterwards
show
him
what
you
are
,
imp
of
Satan
.
 
<EOS>
And
take
that
<EOS>
,
I
hope
he
'll
kick
out
your
brains
!
"
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
had
gone
to
loose
the
beast
,
and
shift
it
to
his
own
stall
;
he
was
passing
behind
it
,
when
Hindley
finished
his
speech
by
knocking
him
under
its
feet
,
and
without
stopping
to
examine
whether
his
hopes
were
fulfilled
,
ran
away
as
fast
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
I
was
surprised
to
witness
how
coolly
the
child
gathered
himself
up
,
and
went
on
with
his
intention
;
exchanging
saddles
and
all
,
and
then
sitting
down
on
a
bundle
of
hay
to
overcome
the
qualm
which
the
violent
blow
occasioned
,
before
he
entered
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
persuaded
him
easily
to
let
me
lay
the
blame
of
his
bruises
on
the
horse
:
he
minded
little
what
tale
was
told
since
he
had
what
he
wanted
.
<EOS>
He
complained
so
seldom
,
indeed
,
of
such
stirs
as
these
,
that
I
really
thought
him
not
vindictive
:
I
was
deceived
completely
,
as
you
will
hear
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
time
Mr.
Earnshaw
began
to
fail
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
active
and
healthy
,
yet
his
strength
left
him
suddenly
;
and
when
he
was
confined
to
the
chimney
-
corner
he
grew
grievously
irritable
.
<EOS>
A
nothing
vexed
him
;
and
suspected
slights
of
his
authority
nearly
threw
him
into
fits
.
<EOS>
This
was
especially
to
be
remarked
<EOS>
if
any
one
attempted
to
impose
upon
,
or
domineer
over
,
his
favourite
:
he
was
painfully
jealous
lest
a
word
should
be
spoken
amiss
to
him
;
seeming
to
have
got
into
his
head
the
notion
that
,
because
he
liked
Heathcliff
,
all
hated
,
and
longed
to
do
him
an
ill
-
turn
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
disadvantage
to
the
lad
;
for
the
kinder
among
us
did
not
wish
to
fret
the
master
,
so
we
humoured
his
partiality
;
and
that
humouring
was
rich
nourishment
to
the
child
's
pride
and
black
tempers
.
<EOS>
Still
it
became
in
a
manner
necessary
;
twice
,
or
thrice
,
Hindley
's
manifestation
of
scorn
,
while
his
father
was
near
,
roused
the
old
man
to
a
fury
:
he
seized
his
stick
to
strike
him
,
and
shook
with
rage
that
he
could
not
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
our
curate
(
we
had
a
curate
then
who
made
the
living
answer
by
teaching
the
little
Lintons
and
Earnshaws
,
and
farming
his
bit
of
land
himself
)
advised
that
the
young
man
should
be
sent
to
college
;
and
Mr.
Earnshaw
agreed
,
though
with
a
heavy
spirit
,
for
he
said
 
"
Hindley
was
nought
,
and
would
never
thrive
as
where
he
wandered
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
hoped
heartily
we
should
have
peace
now
.
<EOS>
It
hurt
me
to
think
the
master
should
be
made
uncomfortable
by
his
own
good
deed
.
<EOS>
I
fancied
the
discontent
of
age
and
disease
arose
from
his
family
disagreements
;
as
he
would
have
it
that
it
did
:
really
,
you
know
,
sir
,
it
was
in
his
sinking
frame
.
<EOS>
We
might
have
got
on
tolerably
,
notwithstanding
,
but
for
two
people
 
Miss
Cathy
,
and
Joseph
,
the
servant
<EOS>
:
you
saw
him
,
I
daresay
,
up
yonder
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
and
is
yet
most
likely
,
the
wearisomest
self
-
righteous
Pharisee
that
ever
ransacked
a
Bible
to
rake
the
promises
to
himself
and
fling
the
curses
to
his
neighbours
.
<EOS>
By
his
knack
of
sermonising
and
pious
discoursing
,
he
contrived
to
make
a
great
impression
on
Mr.
Earnshaw
;
and
the
more
feeble
the
master
became
,
the
more
influence
he
gained
.
<EOS>
He
was
relentless
in
worrying
him
about
his
soul
's
concerns
,
and
about
ruling
his
children
rigidly
.
<EOS>
He
encouraged
him
to
regard
Hindley
as
a
reprobate
;
and
,
night
after
night
,
he
regularly
grumbled
out
a
long
string
of
tales
against
Heathcliff
and
Catherine
:
always
minding
to
flatter
Earnshaw
's
weakness
by
heaping
the
heaviest
blame
on
the
latter
.
  
<EOS>
Certainly
she
had
ways
with
her
such
as
<EOS>
I
never
saw
a
child
take
up
before
;
and
she
put
all
of
us
past
our
patience
fifty
times
and
oftener
in
a
day
:
from
the
hour
she
came
down
-
stairs
till
the
hour
she
went
to
bed
,
we
had
not
a
minute
's
security
that
she
would
n't
be
in
mischief
.
<EOS>
Her
spirits
were
always
at
high
-
water
mark
,
her
tongue
always
going
 
singing
,
laughing
,
and
plaguing
everybody
who
would
not
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
A
wild
,
wicked
slip
<EOS>
she
was
 
<EOS>
but
she
had
the
bonniest
eye
,
the
sweetest
smile
,
and
lightest
foot
in
the
parish
:
<EOS>
and
,
after
all
,
I
believe
she
meant
no
harm
;
for
when
once
she
made
you
cry
in
good
earnest
,
it
seldom
happened
that
she
would
not
keep
you
company
,
and
oblige
you
to
be
quiet
that
you
might
comfort
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
much
too
fond
of
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
The
greatest
punishment
we
could
invent
for
her
was
to
keep
her
separate
from
him
:
yet
she
got
chided
more
than
any
of
us
on
his
account
.
<EOS>
In
play
,
she
liked
exceedingly
to
act
the
little
mistress
;
using
her
hands
freely
,
and
commanding
her
companions
:
she
did
so
to
me
,
but
I
would
not
bear
slapping
and
ordering
;
and
so
I
let
her
know
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr.
Earnshaw
did
not
understand
jokes
from
his
children
:
he
had
always
been
strict
and
grave
with
them
;
and
Catherine
,
on
her
part
,
had
no
idea
why
her
father
should
be
crosser
and
less
patient
in
his
ailing
condition
than
he
was
in
his
prime
.
<EOS>
His
peevish
reproofs
wakened
in
her
a
naughty
delight
to
provoke
him
:
she
was
never
so
happy
as
when
we
were
all
scolding
her
at
once
,
and
she
defying
us
with
her
bold
,
saucy
look
,
and
her
ready
words
;
turning
Joseph
's
religious
curses
into
ridicule
,
baiting
me
,
and
doing
just
what
her
father
hated
most
 
showing
how
her
pretended
insolence
,
which
he
thought
real
,
had
more
power
over
Heathcliff
than
his
kindness
:
how
the
boy
would
do
_
<EOS>
her
_
bidding
in
anything
,
and
_
<EOS>
his
_
<EOS>
only
when
it
suited
his
own
inclination
.
<EOS>
After
behaving
as
badly
as
possible
all
day
,
she
sometimes
came
fondling
to
make
it
up
at
night
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
Cathy
,
"
the
old
man
would
say
,
"
I
can
not
love
thee
,
thou'rt
worse
than
thy
brother
.
<EOS>
Go
,
say
thy
prayers
,
child
,
and
ask
God
's
pardon
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
thy
mother
<EOS>
and
I
must
rue
that
we
ever
reared
thee
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
made
her
cry
,
at
first
;
and
then
being
repulsed
continually
hardened
her
,
and
she
laughed
if
I
told
her
to
say
she
was
sorry
for
her
faults
,
and
beg
to
be
forgiven
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
hour
came
,
at
last
,
that
ended
Mr.
Earnshaw
's
troubles
on
earth
.
<EOS>
He
died
quietly
in
his
chair
one
October
evening
,
seated
by
the
fire
-
side
.
<EOS>
A
high
wind
blustered
round
the
house
,
and
roared
in
the
chimney
:
it
sounded
wild
and
stormy
,
yet
it
was
not
cold
,
and
we
were
all
together
 
I
,
a
little
removed
from
the
hearth
,
busy
at
my
knitting
,
and
Joseph
reading
his
Bible
near
the
table
(
for
the
servants
generally
sat
in
the
house
then
,
after
their
work
was
done
)
.
<EOS>
Miss
Cathy
had
been
sick
,
and
that
made
her
still
;
she
leant
against
her
father
's
knee
,
and
Heathcliff
was
lying
on
the
floor
with
his
head
in
her
lap
.
<EOS>
I
remember
the
master
,
before
he
fell
into
a
doze
,
stroking
her
bonny
hair
 
<EOS>
it
pleased
him
rarely
to
see
her
gentle
 
and
saying
,
"
Why
canst
thou
not
always
be
a
good
lass
,
Cathy
?
"
<EOS>
And
she
turned
her
face
up
to
his
,
and
laughed
,
and
answered
,
"
Why
can
not
you
always
be
a
good
man
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
vexed
again
,
she
kissed
his
hand
,
and
said
she
would
sing
him
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
She
began
singing
very
low
,
till
his
fingers
dropped
from
hers
,
and
his
head
sank
on
his
breast
.
<EOS>
Then
I
told
her
to
hush
,
and
not
stir
,
for
fear
she
should
wake
him
.
<EOS>
We
all
kept
as
mute
as
mice
a
full
half
-
hour
,
and
should
have
done
so
longer
,
only
Joseph
,
having
finished
his
chapter
,
got
up
and
said
that
he
must
rouse
the
master
for
prayers
and
bed
.
<EOS>
He
stepped
forward
,
and
called
him
by
name
,
and
touched
his
shoulder
;
but
he
would
not
move
:
so
he
took
the
candle
and
looked
at
him
.
<EOS>
I
thought
there
was
something
wrong
as
he
set
down
the
light
;
and
seizing
the
children
each
by
an
arm
,
whispered
them
to
"
frame
up
-
stairs
,
and
make
little
din
 
<EOS>
they
might
pray
alone
that
evening
 
he
had
summut
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
bid
father
good
-
night
first
,
"
said
Catherine
,
putting
her
arms
round
his
neck
,
before
we
could
hinder
her
.
<EOS>
The
poor
thing
discovered
her
loss
directly
 
<EOS>
she
screamed
out
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
's
dead
,
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
he
's
dead
!
"
<EOS>
And
they
both
set
up
a
heart
-
breaking
cry
.
  
<EOS>
I
joined
my
wail
to
theirs
,
loud
and
bitter
;
but
Joseph
asked
what
we
could
be
thinking
of
to
roar
in
that
way
over
a
saint
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
to
put
on
my
cloak
and
run
to
Gimmerton
for
the
doctor
and
the
parson
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
guess
the
use
that
either
would
be
of
,
then
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
went
,
through
wind
and
rain
,
and
brought
one
,
the
doctor
,
back
with
me
;
the
other
said
he
would
come
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Leaving
Joseph
to
explain
matters
,
I
ran
to
the
children
's
room
:
their
door
was
ajar
,
I
saw
they
had
never
lain
down
,
though
it
was
past
midnight
;
but
they
were
calmer
,
and
did
not
need
me
to
console
them
.
<EOS>
The
little
souls
were
comforting
each
other
with
better
thoughts
than
I
could
have
hit
on
:
no
parson
in
the
world
ever
pictured
heaven
so
beautifully
as
they
did
,
in
their
innocent
talk
;
and
,
while
I
sobbed
and
listened
,
I
could
not
help
wishing
we
were
all
there
safe
together
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Hindley
came
home
to
the
funeral
;
and
 
a
thing
that
amazed
us
,
and
set
the
neighbours
gossiping
right
and
left
 
he
brought
a
wife
with
him
.
<EOS>
What
she
was
,
and
where
she
was
born
,
he
never
informed
us
:
<EOS>
probably
,
she
had
neither
money
nor
name
to
recommend
her
,
or
he
would
scarcely
have
kept
the
union
from
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
not
one
that
would
have
disturbed
the
house
much
on
her
own
account
.
<EOS>
Every
object
she
saw
,
the
moment
she
crossed
the
threshold
,
appeared
to
delight
her
;
and
every
circumstance
that
took
place
about
her
:
except
the
preparing
for
the
burial
,
and
the
presence
of
the
mourners
.
<EOS>
I
thought
she
was
half
silly
,
from
her
behaviour
while
that
went
on
:
she
ran
into
her
chamber
,
and
made
me
come
with
her
,
though
I
should
have
been
dressing
the
children
:
and
there
she
sat
shivering
and
clasping
her
hands
,
and
asking
repeatedly
 
"
Are
they
gone
yet
?
"
<EOS>
Then
she
began
describing
with
hysterical
emotion
the
effect
it
produced
on
her
to
see
black
;
and
started
,
and
trembled
,
and
,
at
last
,
fell
a
-
weeping
 
and
<EOS>
when
I
asked
what
was
the
matter
,
answered
,
she
did
n't
know
;
but
she
felt
so
afraid
of
dying
!
<EOS>
I
imagined
her
as
little
likely
to
die
as
myself
.
<EOS>
She
was
rather
thin
,
but
young
,
and
fresh
-
complexioned
,
and
her
eyes
sparkled
as
bright
as
diamonds
.
<EOS>
I
did
remark
,
to
be
sure
,
that
mounting
the
stairs
made
her
breathe
very
quick
;
that
the
least
sudden
noise
set
her
all
in
a
quiver
,
and
that
she
coughed
troublesomely
sometimes
:
but
I
knew
nothing
of
what
these
symptoms
portended
,
and
had
no
impulse
to
sympathise
with
her
.
<EOS>
We
do
n't
in
general
take
to
foreigners
here
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
unless
they
take
to
us
first
.
  
<EOS>
Young
Earnshaw
was
altered
considerably
in
the
three
years
of
his
absence
.
<EOS>
He
had
grown
sparer
,
and
lost
his
colour
,
and
spoke
and
dressed
quite
differently
;
and
,
on
the
very
day
of
his
return
,
he
told
Joseph
and
me
we
must
thenceforth
quarter
ourselves
in
the
back
-
kitchen
,
and
leave
the
house
for
him
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
would
have
carpeted
and
papered
a
small
spare
room
for
a
parlour
;
but
his
wife
expressed
such
pleasure
at
the
white
floor
and
huge
glowing
fireplace
,
at
the
pewter
dishes
and
delf
-
case
,
and
dog
-
kennel
,
and
the
wide
space
there
was
to
move
about
in
where
they
usually
sat
,
that
he
thought
it
unnecessary
to
her
comfort
,
and
so
dropped
the
intention
.
  
<EOS>
She
expressed
pleasure
,
too
,
at
finding
a
sister
among
her
new
acquaintance
;
and
she
prattled
to
Catherine
,
and
kissed
her
,
and
ran
about
with
her
,
and
gave
her
quantities
of
presents
,
at
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
Her
affection
tired
very
soon
,
however
,
and
when
she
grew
peevish
,
Hindley
became
tyrannical
.
<EOS>
A
few
words
from
her
,
evincing
a
dislike
to
Heathcliff
,
were
enough
to
rouse
in
him
all
his
old
hatred
of
the
boy
.
<EOS>
He
drove
him
from
their
company
to
the
servants
,
deprived
him
of
the
instructions
of
the
curate
,
and
insisted
that
he
should
labour
out
of
doors
instead
;
compelling
him
to
do
so
as
hard
as
any
other
lad
on
the
farm
.
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
bore
his
degradation
pretty
well
at
first
,
because
Cathy
taught
him
what
she
learnt
,
and
worked
or
played
with
him
in
the
fields
.
<EOS>
They
both
promised
fair
to
grow
up
as
rude
as
savages
;
the
young
master
being
entirely
negligent
how
they
behaved
,
and
what
they
did
,
so
they
kept
clear
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
even
have
seen
after
their
going
to
church
on
Sundays
,
only
Joseph
and
the
curate
reprimanded
his
carelessness
when
they
absented
themselves
;
and
that
reminded
him
to
order
Heathcliff
a
flogging
,
and
Catherine
a
fast
from
dinner
or
supper
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
one
of
their
chief
amusements
to
run
away
to
the
moors
in
the
morning
and
remain
there
all
day
,
and
the
after
punishment
grew
a
mere
thing
to
laugh
at
.
<EOS>
The
curate
might
set
as
many
chapters
as
he
pleased
for
Catherine
to
get
by
heart
,
and
Joseph
might
thrash
Heathcliff
till
his
arm
ached
;
they
forgot
everything
the
minute
they
were
together
again
:
at
least
the
minute
they
had
contrived
some
naughty
plan
of
revenge
;
and
many
a
time
I
've
cried
to
myself
to
watch
them
growing
more
reckless
daily
,
and
I
not
daring
to
speak
a
syllable
,
for
fear
of
losing
the
small
power
I
still
retained
over
the
unfriended
creatures
.
<EOS>
One
Sunday
evening
,
it
chanced
that
they
were
banished
from
the
sitting
-
room
,
for
making
a
noise
,
or
a
light
offence
of
the
kind
;
and
when
I
went
to
call
them
to
supper
,
I
could
discover
them
nowhere
.
<EOS>
We
searched
the
house
,
above
and
below
,
and
the
yard
and
stables
;
they
were
invisible
:
and
,
at
last
,
Hindley
in
a
passion
told
us
to
bolt
the
doors
,
and
swore
nobody
should
let
them
in
that
night
.
<EOS>
The
household
went
to
bed
;
and
I
,
too
,
anxious
to
lie
down
,
opened
my
lattice
and
put
my
head
out
to
hearken
,
though
it
rained
:
determined
to
admit
them
in
spite
of
the
prohibition
,
should
they
return
.
<EOS>
In
a
while
,
I
distinguished
steps
coming
up
the
road
,
and
the
light
of
a
lantern
glimmered
through
the
gate
.
<EOS>
I
threw
a
shawl
over
my
head
and
ran
to
prevent
them
from
waking
Mr.
Earnshaw
by
knocking
.
<EOS>
There
was
Heathcliff
,
by
himself
:
it
gave
me
a
start
to
see
him
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Miss
Catherine
?
<EOS>
"
I
cried
hurriedly
.
"
<EOS>
No
accident
,
I
hope
?
"
<EOS>
"
At
Thrushcross
Grange
,
"
he
answered
;
"
and
I
would
have
been
there
too
,
but
they
had
not
the
manners
to
ask
me
to
stay
.
"
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
will
catch
it
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
said
:
"
you
'll
never
be
content
till
you
're
sent
about
your
business
.
<EOS>
What
in
the
world
led
you
wandering
to
Thrushcross
Grange
?
"
<EOS>
"
Let
me
get
off
my
wet
clothes
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
all
about
it
,
<EOS>
Nelly
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
I
bid
him
beware
of
rousing
the
master
,
and
while
he
undressed
<EOS>
and
I
waited
to
put
out
the
candle
<EOS>
,
he
continued
 
<EOS>
"
Cathy
and
I
escaped
from
the
wash
-
house
to
have
a
ramble
at
liberty
,
and
getting
a
glimpse
of
the
Grange
lights
,
we
thought
we
would
just
go
and
see
whether
the
Lintons
passed
their
Sunday
evenings
standing
shivering
in
corners
,
while
their
father
and
mother
sat
eating
and
drinking
,
and
singing
and
laughing
,
and
burning
their
eyes
out
before
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
they
do
?
<EOS>
Or
reading
sermons
,
and
being
catechised
by
their
manservant
,
and
set
to
learn
a
column
of
Scripture
names
,
if
they
do
n't
answer
properly
?
"
<EOS>
"
Probably
not
,
"
I
responded
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
good
children
,
no
doubt
,
and
do
n't
deserve
the
treatment
you
receive
,
for
your
bad
conduct
.
"
"
Do
n't
ca
nt
,
Nelly
,
"
he
said
:
"
nonsense
!
<EOS>
We
ran
from
the
top
of
the
Heights
to
the
park
,
without
stopping
 
Catherine
completely
beaten
in
the
race
,
because
she
was
barefoot
.
<EOS>
You
'll
have
to
seek
for
her
shoes
in
the
bog
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
We
crept
through
a
broken
hedge
,
groped
our
way
up
the
path
,
and
planted
ourselves
on
a
flower
-
plot
under
the
drawing
-
room
window
.
<EOS>
The
light
came
from
thence
;
they
had
not
put
up
the
shutters
,
and
the
curtains
were
only
half
closed
.
<EOS>
Both
of
us
were
able
to
look
in
by
standing
on
the
basement
,
and
clinging
to
the
ledge
,
and
we
saw
 
ah
!
<EOS>
it
was
beautiful
 
a
splendid
place
carpeted
with
crimson
,
and
crimson
-
covered
chairs
and
tables
,
and
a
pure
white
ceiling
bordered
by
gold
,
a
shower
of
glass
-
drops
hanging
in
silver
chains
from
the
centre
,
and
shimmering
with
little
soft
tapers
.
<EOS>
Old
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Linton
were
not
there
;
Edgar
and
his
sisters
had
it
entirely
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
Should
n't
they
have
been
happy
?
<EOS>
We
should
have
thought
ourselves
in
heaven
!
<EOS>
And
now
,
guess
what
your
good
children
were
doing
?
<EOS>
Isabella
 
<EOS>
I
believe
she
is
eleven
,
a
year
younger
than
Cathy
 
lay
screaming
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
,
shrieking
as
if
witches
were
running
red
-
hot
needles
into
her
.
<EOS>
Edgar
stood
on
the
hearth
weeping
silently
,
and
in
the
middle
of
the
table
sat
a
little
dog
,
shaking
its
paw
and
yelping
;
which
,
from
their
mutual
accusations
,
we
understood
they
had
nearly
pulled
in
two
between
them
.
<EOS>
The
idiots
!
<EOS>
That
was
their
pleasure
!
<EOS>
to
quarrel
who
should
hold
a
heap
of
warm
hair
,
and
each
begin
to
cry
because
both
,
after
struggling
to
get
it
,
refused
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
We
laughed
outright
at
the
petted
things
;
we
did
despise
them
!
<EOS>
When
would
you
catch
me
wishing
to
have
what
Catherine
wanted
?
<EOS>
or
find
us
by
ourselves
,
seeking
entertainment
in
yelling
,
and
sobbing
,
and
rolling
on
the
ground
,
divided
by
the
whole
room
?
<EOS>
I
'd
not
exchange
,
for
a
thousand
lives
,
my
condition
here
,
for
Edgar
Linton
's
at
Thrushcross
Grange
 
not
if
I
might
have
the
privilege
of
flinging
Joseph
off
the
highest
gable
,
and
painting
the
house
-
front
with
Hindley
's
blood
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
hush
!
"
<EOS>
I
interrupted
.
<EOS>
"
Still
you
have
not
told
me
,
Heathcliff
,
how
Catherine
is
left
behind
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
we
laughed
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
The
Lintons
heard
us
,
and
with
one
accord
they
shot
like
arrows
to
the
door
;
there
was
silence
,
and
then
a
cry
,
"
Oh
,
mamma
,
mamma
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
papa
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
mamma
,
come
here
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
papa
,
oh
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
They
really
did
howl
out
something
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
We
made
frightful
noises
to
terrify
them
still
more
,
and
then
we
dropped
off
the
ledge
,
because
somebody
was
drawing
the
bars
,
and
we
felt
we
had
better
flee
.
<EOS>
I
had
Cathy
by
the
hand
,
and
was
urging
her
on
,
when
all
at
once
she
fell
down
.
<EOS>
"
Run
,
Heathcliff
,
run
!
"
<EOS>
she
whispered
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
let
the
bull
-
dog
loose
,
and
he
holds
me
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
devil
had
seized
her
ankle
,
Nelly
:
I
heard
his
abominable
snorting
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
yell
out
 
no
!
<EOS>
she
would
have
scorned
to
do
it
,
if
she
had
been
spitted
on
the
horns
of
a
mad
cow
.
<EOS>
I
did
,
though
:
I
vociferated
curses
enough
to
annihilate
any
fiend
in
Christendom
;
and
I
got
a
stone
and
thrust
it
between
his
jaws
,
and
tried
with
all
my
might
to
cram
it
down
his
throat
.
<EOS>
A
beast
of
a
servant
came
up
with
a
lantern
,
at
last
,
shouting
 
"
Keep
fast
,
Skulker
,
keep
fast
!
"
<EOS>
He
changed
his
note
,
however
,
when
he
saw
Skulker
's
game
.
<EOS>
The
dog
was
throttled
off
;
his
huge
,
purple
tongue
hanging
half
a
foot
out
of
his
mouth
,
and
his
pendent
lips
streaming
with
bloody
slaver
.
<EOS>
The
man
took
Cathy
up
;
she
was
sick
:
not
from
fear
,
I
'm
certain
,
but
from
pain
.
<EOS>
He
carried
her
in
;
I
followed
,
grumbling
execrations
and
vengeance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
prey
,
Robert
?
<EOS>
"
hallooed
Linton
from
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Skulker
has
caught
a
little
girl
,
sir
,
"
he
replied
;
"
and
there
's
a
lad
here
,
"
he
added
,
making
a
clutch
at
me
,
"
who
looks
an
out
-
and
-
outer
!
<EOS>
Very
like
the
robbers
were
for
putting
them
through
the
window
to
open
the
doors
to
the
gang
after
all
were
asleep
,
that
they
might
murder
us
at
their
ease
.
<EOS>
Hold
your
tongue
,
you
foul
-
mouthed
thief
,
you
!
<EOS>
you
shall
go
to
the
gallows
for
this
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
,
sir
,
do
n't
lay
by
your
gun
.
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
Robert
,
"
said
the
old
fool
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
rascals
knew
that
yesterday
was
my
rent
-
day
:
they
thought
to
have
me
cleverly
.
<EOS>
Come
in
;
I
'll
furnish
them
a
reception
.
<EOS>
There
,
John
,
fasten
the
chain
.
<EOS>
Give
Skulker
some
water
,
Jenny
.
<EOS>
To
beard
a
magistrate
in
his
stronghold
,
and
on
the
Sabbath
,
too
!
<EOS>
Where
will
their
insolence
stop
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
dear
Mary
,
look
here
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afraid
,
it
is
but
a
boy
 
yet
the
villain
scowls
so
plainly
in
his
face
;
would
it
not
be
a
kindness
to
the
country
to
hang
him
at
once
,
before
he
shows
his
nature
in
acts
as
well
as
features
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
pulled
me
under
the
chandelier
,
and
Mrs.
Linton
placed
her
spectacles
on
her
nose
and
raised
her
hands
in
horror
.
<EOS>
The
cowardly
children
crept
nearer
also
,
Isabella
lisping
 
"
Frightful
thing
!
<EOS>
Put
him
in
the
cellar
,
papa
.
<EOS>
He
's
exactly
like
the
son
of
the
fortune
-
teller
that
stole
my
tame
pheasant
.
<EOS>
Is
n't
he
,
Edgar
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
While
they
examined
me
,
Cathy
came
round
;
she
heard
the
last
speech
,
and
laughed
.
<EOS>
Edgar
Linton
,
after
an
inquisitive
stare
,
collected
sufficient
wit
to
recognise
her
.
<EOS>
They
see
us
at
church
,
you
know
,
though
we
seldom
meet
them
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
Miss
Earnshaw
?
"
<EOS>
he
whispered
to
his
mother
,
"
and
look
how
Skulker
has
bitten
her
 
how
her
foot
bleeds
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
"
Miss
Earnshaw
?
<EOS>
Nonsense
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
dame
;
"
Miss
Earnshaw
scouring
the
country
with
a
gipsy
!
<EOS>
And
yet
,
my
dear
,
the
child
is
in
mourning
 
surely
it
is
 
and
she
may
be
lamed
for
life
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
What
culpable
carelessness
in
her
brother
!
"
exclaimed
Mr.
Linton
,
turning
from
me
to
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
understood
from
Shielders
"
"
(
that
was
the
curate
,
sir
)
"
"
that
he
lets
her
grow
up
in
absolute
heathenism
.
<EOS>
But
who
is
this
?
<EOS>
Where
did
she
pick
up
this
companion
?
<EOS>
Oho
!
<EOS>
I
declare
he
is
that
strange
acquisition
<EOS>
my
late
neighbour
made
,
in
his
journey
to
Liverpool
 
a
little
Lascar
,
or
an
American
or
Spanish
castaway
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
A
wicked
boy
,
at
all
events
,
"
remarked
the
old
lady
,
"
and
quite
unfit
for
a
decent
house
!
<EOS>
Did
you
notice
his
language
,
Linton
?
<EOS>
I
'm
shocked
that
my
children
should
have
heard
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
recommenced
cursing
 
do
n't
be
angry
,
Nelly
 
<EOS>
and
so
Robert
was
ordered
to
take
me
off
.
<EOS>
I
refused
to
go
without
Cathy
;
he
dragged
me
into
the
garden
,
pushed
the
lantern
into
my
hand
,
assured
me
that
Mr.
Earnshaw
should
be
informed
of
my
behaviour
,
and
,
bidding
me
march
directly
,
secured
the
door
again
.
<EOS>
The
curtains
were
still
looped
up
at
one
corner
,
and
I
resumed
my
station
as
spy
;
because
,
if
Catherine
had
wished
to
return
,
I
intended
shattering
their
great
glass
panes
to
a
million
of
fragments
,
unless
they
let
her
out
.
<EOS>
She
sat
on
the
sofa
quietly
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
took
off
the
grey
cloak
of
the
dairy
-
maid
which
we
had
borrowed
for
our
excursion
,
shaking
her
head
and
expostulating
with
her
,
I
suppose
:
she
was
a
young
lady
,
and
they
made
a
distinction
between
her
treatment
and
mine
.
<EOS>
Then
the
woman
-
servant
brought
a
basin
of
warm
water
,
and
washed
her
feet
;
and
Mr.
Linton
mixed
a
tumbler
of
negus
,
and
Isabella
emptied
a
plateful
of
cakes
into
her
lap
,
and
Edgar
stood
gaping
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
Afterwards
,
they
dried
and
combed
her
beautiful
hair
,
and
gave
her
a
pair
of
enormous
slippers
,
and
wheeled
her
to
the
fire
;
and
I
left
her
,
as
merry
as
she
could
be
,
dividing
her
food
between
the
little
dog
and
Skulker
,
whose
nose
she
pinched
as
he
ate
;
and
kindling
a
spark
of
spirit
in
the
vacant
blue
eyes
of
the
Lintons
 
a
dim
reflection
from
her
own
enchanting
face
.
<EOS>
I
saw
they
were
full
of
stupid
admiration
;
she
is
so
immeasurably
superior
to
them
 
to
everybody
on
earth
,
is
she
not
,
Nelly
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
will
more
come
of
this
business
than
you
reckon
on
,
"
I
answered
,
covering
him
up
and
extinguishing
the
light
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
incurable
,
Heathcliff
;
and
Mr.
Hindley
will
have
to
proceed
to
extremities
,
see
if
he
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
"
My
words
came
truer
than
I
desired
.
<EOS>
The
luckless
adventure
made
Earnshaw
furious
.
<EOS>
And
then
Mr.
Linton
,
to
mend
matters
,
paid
us
a
visit
himself
on
the
morrow
,
and
read
the
young
master
such
a
lecture
on
the
road
he
guided
his
family
,
that
he
was
stirred
to
look
about
him
,
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
received
no
flogging
,
but
he
was
told
that
the
first
word
he
spoke
to
Miss
Catherine
should
ensure
a
dismissal
;
and
Mrs.
Earnshaw
undertook
to
keep
her
sister
-
in
-
law
in
due
restraint
when
she
returned
home
;
employing
art
,
not
force
:
with
force
she
would
have
found
it
impossible
.
    
<EOS>
Cathy
stayed
at
Thrushcross
Grange
five
weeks
:
till
Christmas
.
<EOS>
By
that
time
her
ankle
was
thoroughly
cured
,
and
her
manners
much
improved
.
<EOS>
The
mistress
visited
her
often
in
the
interval
,
and
commenced
her
plan
of
reform
by
trying
to
raise
her
self
-
respect
with
fine
clothes
and
flattery
,
which
she
took
readily
;
so
that
,
instead
of
a
wild
,
hatless
little
savage
jumping
into
the
house
,
and
rushing
to
squeeze
us
all
breathless
,
there
"
lighted
from
a
handsome
black
pony
a
very
dignified
person
,
with
brown
ringlets
falling
from
the
cover
of
a
feathered
beaver
,
and
a
long
cloth
habit
,
which
she
was
obliged
to
hold
up
with
both
hands
that
she
might
sail
in
.
<EOS>
Hindley
lifted
her
from
her
horse
,
exclaiming
delightedly
,
"
Why
,
Cathy
,
you
are
quite
a
beauty
!
<EOS>
I
should
scarcely
have
known
you
:
you
look
like
a
lady
now
.
<EOS>
Isabella
Linton
is
not
to
be
compared
with
her
,
is
she
,
Frances
?
"
<EOS>
"
Isabella
has
not
her
natural
advantages
,
"
replied
his
wife
:
"
<EOS>
but
she
must
mind
and
not
grow
wild
again
here
.
<EOS>
Ellen
,
help
Miss
Catherine
off
with
her
things
 
<EOS>
Stay
,
dear
,
you
will
disarrange
your
curls
 
<EOS>
let
me
untie
your
hat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
removed
the
habit
,
and
there
shone
forth
beneath
a
grand
plaid
silk
frock
,
white
trousers
,
and
burnished
shoes
;
and
,
while
her
eyes
sparkled
joyfully
when
the
dogs
came
bounding
up
to
welcome
her
,
she
dared
hardly
touch
them
lest
they
should
fawn
upon
her
splendid
garments
.
<EOS>
She
kissed
me
gently
<EOS>
:
I
was
all
flour
making
the
Christmas
cake
,
and
it
would
not
have
done
to
give
me
a
hug
;
and
then
she
looked
round
for
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Earnshaw
watched
anxiously
their
meeting
;
thinking
it
would
enable
them
to
judge
,
in
some
measure
,
what
grounds
they
had
for
hoping
to
succeed
in
separating
the
two
friends
.
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
was
hard
to
discover
,
at
first
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
careless
,
and
uncared
for
,
before
Catherine
's
absence
,
he
had
been
ten
times
more
so
since
.
<EOS>
Nobody
but
I
even
did
him
the
kindness
to
call
him
a
dirty
boy
,
and
bid
him
wash
himself
,
once
a
week
;
and
children
of
his
age
seldom
have
a
natural
pleasure
in
soap
and
water
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
not
to
mention
his
clothes
,
which
had
seen
three
months
'
service
in
mire
and
dust
,
and
his
thick
uncombed
hair
,
the
surface
of
his
face
and
hands
was
dismally
beclouded
.
<EOS>
He
might
well
skulk
behind
the
settle
,
on
beholding
<EOS>
such
a
bright
,
graceful
damsel
enter
the
house
,
instead
of
a
rough
-
headed
counterpart
of
himself
,
as
he
expected
.
<EOS>
"
Is
Heathcliff
not
here
?
"
<EOS>
she
demanded
,
pulling
off
her
gloves
,
and
displaying
fingers
wonderfully
whitened
with
doing
nothing
and
staying
indoors
.
  
<EOS>
"
Heathcliff
,
you
may
come
forward
,
"
cried
Mr.
Hindley
,
enjoying
his
discomfiture
,
and
gratified
to
see
what
a
forbidding
young
blackguard
he
would
be
compelled
to
present
himself
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
come
and
wish
Miss
Catherine
welcome
,
like
the
other
servants
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Cathy
,
catching
a
glimpse
of
her
friend
in
his
concealment
,
flew
to
embrace
him
;
she
bestowed
seven
or
eight
kisses
on
his
cheek
within
the
second
,
and
then
stopped
,
and
drawing
back
,
burst
into
a
laugh
,
exclaiming
,
"
Why
,
how
very
black
and
cross
you
look
!
<EOS>
and
how
 
how
funny
and
grim
!
<EOS>
But
that
's
because
I
'm
used
to
Edgar
and
Isabella
Linton
.
<EOS>
Well
,
Heathcliff
,
have
you
forgotten
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
some
reason
to
put
the
question
,
for
shame
and
pride
threw
double
gloom
over
his
countenance
,
and
kept
him
immovable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shake
hands
,
Heathcliff
,
"
said
Mr.
Earnshaw
,
condescendingly
;
"
once
in
a
way
that
is
permitted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
,
"
replied
the
boy
,
finding
his
tongue
at
last
;
"
I
shall
not
stand
to
be
laughed
at
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
bear
it
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
would
have
broken
from
the
circle
,
but
Miss
Cathy
seized
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
mean
to
laugh
at
you
,
"
she
said
;
"
I
could
not
hinder
myself
:
Heathcliff
,
shake
hands
at
least
!
<EOS>
What
are
you
sulky
for
?
<EOS>
It
was
only
that
you
looked
odd
.
<EOS>
If
you
wash
your
face
and
brush
your
hair
,
it
will
be
all
right
:
but
you
are
so
dirty
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
gazed
concernedly
at
the
dusky
fingers
she
held
in
her
own
,
and
also
at
her
dress
;
which
she
feared
had
gained
no
embellishment
from
its
contact
with
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
have
touched
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
answered
,
following
her
eye
and
snatching
away
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
as
dirty
as
I
please
:
<EOS>
and
I
like
to
be
dirty
,
and
I
will
be
dirty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
he
dashed
headforemost
out
of
the
room
,
amid
the
merriment
of
the
master
and
mistress
,
and
to
the
serious
disturbance
of
Catherine
;
who
could
not
comprehend
how
her
remarks
should
have
produced
such
an
exhibition
of
bad
temper
.
  
<EOS>
After
playing
lady's
-
maid
to
the
new
-
comer
,
and
putting
my
cakes
in
the
oven
,
and
making
the
house
and
kitchen
cheerful
with
great
fires
,
befitting
Christmas
-
eve
,
I
prepared
to
sit
down
and
amuse
myself
by
singing
carols
,
all
alone
;
regardless
of
Joseph
's
affirmations
that
he
considered
the
merry
tunes
I
chose
as
next
door
to
songs
.
<EOS>
He
had
retired
to
private
prayer
in
his
chamber
,
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Earnshaw
were
engaging
Missy
's
attention
by
sundry
gay
trifles
bought
for
her
to
present
to
the
little
Lintons
,
as
an
acknowledgment
of
their
kindness
.
<EOS>
They
had
invited
them
to
spend
the
morrow
at
Wuthering
Heights
,
and
the
invitation
had
been
accepted
,
on
one
condition
:
Mrs.
Linton
begged
that
her
darlings
might
be
kept
carefully
apart
from
that
"
naughty
swearing
boy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
I
remained
solitary
.
<EOS>
I
smelt
the
rich
scent
of
the
heating
spices
;
and
admired
the
shining
kitchen
utensils
,
the
polished
clock
,
decked
in
holly
,
the
silver
mugs
ranged
on
a
tray
ready
to
be
filled
with
mulled
ale
for
supper
;
and
above
all
,
the
speckless
purity
of
my
particular
care
 
the
scoured
and
well
-
swept
floor
.
<EOS>
I
gave
due
inward
applause
to
every
object
,
and
then
I
remembered
how
old
Earnshaw
used
to
come
in
when
all
was
tidied
,
and
call
me
a
ca
nt
lass
,
and
slip
a
shilling
into
my
hand
as
a
Christmas
-
box
;
and
from
that
I
went
on
to
think
of
his
fondness
for
Heathcliff
,
and
his
dread
lest
he
should
suffer
neglect
after
death
had
removed
him
:
and
that
naturally
led
me
to
consider
the
poor
lad
's
situation
now
,
and
from
singing
I
changed
my
mind
to
crying
.
<EOS>
It
struck
me
soon
,
however
,
there
would
be
more
sense
in
endeavouring
to
repair
some
of
his
wrongs
than
shedding
tears
over
them
:
I
got
up
and
walked
into
the
court
to
seek
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
far
;
I
found
him
smoothing
the
glossy
coat
of
the
new
pony
in
the
stable
,
and
feeding
the
other
beasts
,
according
to
custom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Make
haste
,
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
"
the
kitchen
is
so
comfortable
;
and
Joseph
is
up
-
stairs
:
make
haste
,
and
let
me
dress
you
smart
before
Miss
Cathy
comes
out
,
and
then
you
can
sit
together
,
with
the
whole
hearth
to
yourselves
,
and
have
a
long
chatter
till
bedtime
.
"
  
He
proceeded
with
his
task
,
and
never
turned
his
head
towards
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
 
<EOS>
are
you
coming
?
<EOS>
"
I
continued
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
little
cake
for
each
of
you
,
nearly
enough
;
and
you
'll
need
half
-
an
-
hour
's
donning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
waited
five
minutes
,
but
getting
no
answer
left
him
.
<EOS>
Catherine
supped
with
her
brother
and
sister
-
in
-
law
:
<EOS>
Joseph
and
I
joined
at
an
unsociable
meal
,
seasoned
with
reproofs
on
one
side
and
sauciness
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
His
cake
and
cheese
remained
on
the
table
all
night
for
the
fairies
.
<EOS>
He
managed
to
continue
work
till
nine
o'clock
,
and
then
marched
dumb
and
dour
to
his
chamber
.
<EOS>
Cathy
sat
up
late
,
having
a
world
of
things
to
order
for
the
reception
of
her
new
friends
:
she
came
into
the
kitchen
once
to
speak
to
her
old
one
;
but
he
was
gone
,
and
she
only
stayed
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
with
him
,
and
then
went
back
.
<EOS>
In
the
morning
he
rose
early
;
and
,
as
it
was
a
holiday
,
carried
his
ill
-
humour
on
to
the
moors
;
not
re
-
appearing
till
the
family
were
departed
for
church
.
<EOS>
Fasting
and
reflection
seemed
to
have
brought
him
to
a
better
spirit
.
<EOS>
He
hung
about
me
for
a
while
,
and
having
screwed
up
his
courage
,
exclaimed
abruptly
 
"
Nelly
,
make
me
decent
,
I
'm
going
to
be
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
High
time
,
Heathcliff
,
"
I
said
;
"
you
_
have
<EOS>
_
grieved
<EOS>
Catherine
<EOS>
:
she
's
sorry
she
ever
came
home
,
I
daresay
!
<EOS>
It
looks
as
if
you
envied
her
,
because
she
is
more
thought
of
than
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
notion
of
_
envying
<EOS>
_
Catherine
was
incomprehensible
to
him
,
but
the
notion
of
grieving
her
he
understood
clearly
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
she
say
she
was
grieved
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
,
looking
very
serious
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
cried
when
I
told
her
you
were
off
again
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
_
I
_
cried
last
night
,
"
he
returned
,
"
and
I
had
more
reason
to
cry
than
she
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
:
you
had
the
reason
of
going
to
bed
with
a
proud
heart
and
an
empty
stomach
,
"
said
I.
"
Proud
people
breed
sad
sorrows
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
you
be
ashamed
of
your
touchiness
,
you
must
ask
pardon
,
mind
,
when
she
comes
in
.
<EOS>
You
must
go
up
and
offer
to
kiss
her
,
and
say
 
you
know
best
what
to
say
;
only
do
it
heartily
,
and
not
as
if
you
thought
her
converted
into
a
stranger
by
her
grand
dress
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
though
I
have
dinner
to
get
ready
,
I
'll
steal
time
to
arrange
you
so
that
Edgar
Linton
shall
look
quite
a
doll
beside
you
:
and
that
he
does
.
<EOS>
You
are
younger
,
and
yet
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
you
are
taller
and
twice
as
broad
across
the
shoulders
;
you
could
knock
him
down
in
a
twinkling
;
do
n't
you
feel
that
you
could
?
"
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
's
face
brightened
a
moment
;
then
it
was
overcast
afresh
,
and
he
sighed
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Nelly
,
if
I
knocked
him
down
twenty
times
,
that
would
n't
make
him
less
handsome
or
me
more
so
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
light
hair
and
a
fair
skin
,
and
was
dressed
and
behaved
as
well
,
and
had
a
chance
of
being
as
rich
as
he
will
be
!
"
  
"
And
cried
for
mamma
at
every
turn
,
"
I
added
,
"
and
trembled
if
a
country
lad
heaved
his
fist
against
you
,
and
sat
at
home
all
day
for
a
shower
of
rain
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Heathcliff
,
you
are
showing
a
poor
spirit
!
<EOS>
Come
to
the
glass
,
and
I
'll
let
you
see
what
you
should
wish
.
<EOS>
Do
you
mark
those
two
lines
between
your
eyes
;
and
those
thick
brows
,
that
,
instead
of
rising
arched
,
sink
in
the
middle
;
and
that
couple
of
black
fiends
,
so
deeply
buried
,
who
never
open
their
windows
boldly
,
but
lurk
glinting
under
them
,
like
devil
's
spies
?
<EOS>
Wish
and
learn
to
smooth
away
the
surly
wrinkles
,
to
raise
your
lids
frankly
,
and
change
the
fiends
to
confident
,
innocent
angels
,
suspecting
and
doubting
nothing
,
and
always
seeing
friends
where
they
are
not
sure
of
foes
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
get
the
expression
of
a
vicious
cur
that
appears
to
know
the
kicks
it
gets
are
its
desert
,
and
yet
hates
all
the
world
,
as
well
as
the
kicker
,
for
what
it
suffers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
other
words
,
I
must
wish
for
Edgar
Linton
's
great
blue
eyes
and
even
forehead
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
 
and
that
wo
n't
help
me
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
good
heart
will
help
you
to
a
bonny
face
,
my
lad
,
"
<EOS>
I
continued
,
"
if
you
were
a
regular
black
;
and
a
bad
one
will
turn
the
bonniest
into
something
worse
than
ugly
.
<EOS>
And
now
that
we
've
done
washing
,
and
combing
,
and
sulking
 
tell
me
whether
you
do
n't
think
yourself
rather
handsome
?
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
You
're
fit
for
a
prince
in
disguise
.
<EOS>
Who
knows
but
your
father
was
Emperor
of
China
,
and
your
mother
an
Indian
queen
,
each
of
them
able
to
buy
up
,
with
one
week
's
income
,
Wuthering
Heights
and
Thrushcross
Grange
together
?
<EOS>
And
you
were
kidnapped
by
wicked
sailors
and
brought
to
England
.
<EOS>
Were
I
in
your
place
,
I
would
frame
high
notions
of
my
birth
;
and
the
thoughts
of
what
I
was
should
give
me
courage
and
dignity
to
support
the
oppressions
of
a
little
farmer
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
I
chattered
on
;
and
Heathcliff
gradually
lost
his
frown
and
began
to
look
quite
pleasant
,
when
all
at
once
our
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
rumbling
sound
moving
up
the
road
and
entering
the
court
.
<EOS>
He
ran
to
the
window
and
I
to
the
door
,
just
in
time
to
behold
the
two
Lintons
descend
from
the
family
carriage
,
smothered
in
cloaks
and
furs
,
and
the
Earnshaws
dismount
from
their
horses
:
they
often
rode
to
church
in
winter
.
<EOS>
Catherine
took
a
hand
of
each
of
the
children
,
and
brought
them
into
the
house
and
set
them
before
the
fire
,
which
quickly
put
colour
into
their
white
faces
.
  
<EOS>
I
urged
my
companion
to
hasten
now
and
show
his
amiable
humour
,
and
he
willingly
obeyed
;
but
ill
luck
would
have
it
that
,
as
he
opened
the
door
leading
from
the
kitchen
on
one
side
,
Hindley
opened
it
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
They
met
,
and
the
master
,
irritated
at
seeing
him
clean
and
cheerful
,
or
,
perhaps
,
eager
to
keep
his
promise
to
Mrs.
Linton
,
shoved
him
back
with
a
sudden
thrust
,
and
angrily
bade
Joseph
"
keep
the
fellow
out
of
the
room
 
send
him
into
the
garret
till
dinner
is
over
.
<EOS>
He
'll
be
cramming
his
fingers
in
the
tarts
and
stealing
the
fruit
,
if
left
alone
with
them
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
sir
,
"
I
could
not
avoid
answering
,
"
he
'll
touch
nothing
,
not
he
:
and
I
suppose
he
must
have
his
share
of
the
dainties
as
well
as
we
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
shall
have
his
share
of
my
hand
,
if
I
catch
him
downstairs
till
dark
,
"
cried
Hindley
.
<EOS>
"
Begone
,
you
vagabond
!
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
you
are
attempting
the
coxcomb
,
are
you
?
<EOS>
Wait
till
I
get
hold
of
those
elegant
locks
 
<EOS>
see
if
I
wo
n't
pull
them
a
bit
longer
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
long
enough
already
,
"
observed
Master
Linton
,
peeping
from
the
doorway
;
"
I
wonder
they
do
n't
make
his
head
ache
.
<EOS>
It
's
like
a
colt
's
mane
over
his
eyes
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
ventured
this
remark
without
any
intention
to
insult
;
but
Heathcliff
's
violent
nature
was
not
prepared
to
endure
the
appearance
of
impertinence
from
one
whom
he
seemed
to
hate
,
even
then
,
as
a
rival
.
<EOS>
He
seized
a
tureen
of
hot
apple
sauce
(
the
first
thing
that
came
under
his
gripe
)
and
dashed
it
full
against
the
speaker
's
face
and
neck
;
who
instantly
commenced
a
lament
that
brought
Isabella
and
Catherine
hurrying
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Earnshaw
snatched
up
the
culprit
directly
and
conveyed
him
to
his
chamber
;
where
,
doubtless
,
he
administered
a
rough
remedy
to
cool
the
fit
of
passion
,
for
he
appeared
red
and
breathless
.
<EOS>
I
got
the
dishcloth
,
and
rather
spitefully
scrubbed
Edgar
's
nose
and
mouth
,
affirming
it
served
him
right
for
meddling
.
<EOS>
His
sister
began
weeping
to
go
home
,
and
Cathy
stood
by
confounded
,
blushing
for
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
not
have
spoken
to
him
!
"
<EOS>
she
expostulated
with
Master
Linton
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
in
a
bad
temper
,
and
now
you
've
spoilt
your
visit
;
and
he
'll
be
flogged
<EOS>
:
I
hate
him
to
be
flogged
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
eat
my
dinner
.
<EOS>
Why
did
you
speak
to
him
,
Edgar
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
,
"
sobbed
the
youth
,
escaping
from
my
hands
,
and
finishing
the
remainder
of
the
purification
with
his
cambric
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
"
I
promised
mamma
that
I
would
n't
say
one
word
to
him
,
and
I
did
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
do
n't
cry
,
"
replied
Catherine
,
contemptuously
;
"
you
're
not
killed
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
make
more
mischief
;
my
brother
is
coming
:
be
quiet
!
<EOS>
Hush
,
Isabella
!
<EOS>
Has
anybody
hurt
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
there
,
children
 
to
your
seats
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hindley
,
bustling
in
.
<EOS>
"
That
brute
of
a
lad
has
warmed
me
nicely
.
<EOS>
Next
time
,
Master
Edgar
,
take
the
law
into
your
own
fists
 
it
will
give
you
an
appetite
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
little
party
recovered
its
equanimity
at
sight
of
the
fragrant
feast
.
<EOS>
They
were
hungry
after
their
ride
,
and
easily
consoled
,
since
no
real
harm
had
befallen
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Earnshaw
carved
bountiful
platefuls
,
and
the
mistress
made
them
merry
with
lively
talk
.
<EOS>
I
waited
behind
her
chair
,
and
was
pained
to
behold
Catherine
,
with
dry
eyes
and
an
indifferent
air
,
commence
cutting
up
the
wing
of
a
goose
before
her
.
"
<EOS>
An
unfeeling
child
,
"
I
thought
to
myself
;
"
how
lightly
she
dismisses
her
old
playmate
's
troubles
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
imagined
her
to
be
so
selfish
.
"
<EOS>
She
lifted
a
mouthful
to
her
lips
:
then
she
set
it
down
again
:
her
cheeks
flushed
,
and
the
tears
gushed
over
them
.
<EOS>
She
slipped
her
fork
to
the
floor
,
and
hastily
dived
under
the
cloth
to
conceal
her
emotion
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
call
her
unfeeling
long
;
for
I
perceived
she
was
in
purgatory
throughout
the
day
,
and
wearying
to
find
an
opportunity
of
getting
by
herself
,
or
paying
a
visit
to
Heathcliff
,
who
had
been
locked
up
by
the
master
:
as
I
discovered
,
on
endeavouring
to
introduce
to
him
a
private
mess
of
victuals
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
evening
we
had
a
dance
.
<EOS>
Cathy
begged
that
he
might
be
liberated
then
,
as
Isabella
Linton
had
no
partner
:
her
entreaties
were
vain
,
and
I
was
appointed
to
supply
the
deficiency
.
<EOS>
We
got
rid
of
all
gloom
in
the
excitement
of
the
exercise
,
and
our
pleasure
was
increased
by
the
arrival
of
the
Gimmerton
band
,
mustering
fifteen
strong
:
<EOS>
a
trumpet
,
a
trombone
,
clarionets
,
bassoons
,
French
horns
,
and
a
bass
viol
,
besides
singers
.
<EOS>
They
go
the
rounds
of
all
the
respectable
houses
,
and
receive
contributions
every
Christmas
,
and
we
esteemed
it
a
first
-
rate
treat
to
hear
them
.
<EOS>
After
the
usual
carols
had
been
sung
,
we
set
them
to
songs
and
glees
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Earnshaw
loved
the
music
,
and
so
they
gave
us
plenty
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
loved
it
too
:
but
she
said
it
sounded
sweetest
at
the
top
of
the
steps
,
and
she
went
up
in
the
dark
:
<EOS>
I
followed
.
<EOS>
They
shut
the
house
door
below
,
never
noting
our
absence
,
it
was
so
full
of
people
.
<EOS>
She
made
no
stay
at
the
stairs'-head
,
but
mounted
farther
,
to
the
garret
where
Heathcliff
was
confined
,
and
called
him
.
<EOS>
He
stubbornly
declined
answering
for
a
while
:
she
persevered
,
and
finally
persuaded
him
to
hold
communion
with
her
through
the
boards
.
<EOS>
I
let
the
poor
things
converse
unmolested
,
till
I
supposed
the
songs
were
going
to
cease
,
and
the
singers
to
get
some
refreshment
:
then
I
clambered
up
the
ladder
to
warn
her
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
finding
her
outside
,
I
heard
her
voice
within
.
<EOS>
The
little
monkey
had
crept
by
the
skylight
of
one
garret
,
along
the
roof
,
into
the
skylight
of
the
other
,
and
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
I
could
coax
her
out
again
.
<EOS>
When
she
did
come
,
Heathcliff
came
with
her
,
and
she
insisted
that
I
should
take
him
into
the
kitchen
,
as
my
fellow
-
servant
had
gone
to
a
neighbour
's
,
to
be
removed
from
the
sound
of
our
"
devil
's
psalmody
,
"
as
it
pleased
him
to
call
it
.
<EOS>
I
told
them
I
intended
by
no
means
to
encourage
their
tricks
:
but
as
the
prisoner
had
never
broken
his
fast
since
yesterday
's
dinner
,
I
would
wink
at
his
cheating
Mr.
Hindley
that
once
.
<EOS>
He
went
down
:
I
set
him
a
stool
by
the
fire
,
and
offered
him
a
quantity
of
good
things
:
but
he
was
sick
and
could
eat
little
,
and
my
attempts
to
entertain
him
were
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
He
leant
his
two
elbows
on
his
knees
,
and
his
chin
on
his
hands
and
remained
rapt
in
dumb
meditation
.
<EOS>
On
my
inquiring
the
subject
of
his
thoughts
,
he
answered
gravely
 
"
I
'm
trying
to
settle
how
I
shall
pay
Hindley
back
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
how
long
I
wait
,
if
I
can
only
do
it
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
not
die
before
I
do
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
shame
,
Heathcliff
!
"
said
I.
<EOS>
"
It
is
for
God
to
punish
wicked
people
;
we
should
learn
to
forgive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
God
wo
n't
have
the
satisfaction
that
I
shall
,
"
he
returned
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
wish
I
knew
the
best
way
!
<EOS>
Let
me
alone
,
and
I
'll
plan
it
out
:
while
I
'm
thinking
of
that
I
do
n't
feel
pain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
I
forget
these
tales
can
not
divert
you
.
<EOS>
I
'm
annoyed
how
I
should
dream
of
chattering
on
at
such
a
rate
;
and
your
gruel
cold
,
and
you
nodding
for
bed
!
<EOS>
I
could
have
told
Heathcliff
's
history
,
all
that
you
need
hear
,
in
half
a
dozen
words
.
"
     
<EOS>
Thus
interrupting
herself
,
the
housekeeper
rose
,
and
proceeded
to
lay
aside
her
sewing
;
but
I
felt
incapable
of
moving
from
the
hearth
,
and
I
was
very
far
from
nodding
.
"
<EOS>
Sit
still
,
Mrs.
Dean
,
"
I
cried
;
"
do
sit
still
another
half
-
hour
.
<EOS>
You
've
done
just
right
to
tell
the
story
leisurely
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
method
I
like
;
and
you
must
finish
it
in
the
same
style
.
<EOS>
I
am
interested
in
every
character
you
have
mentioned
,
more
or
less
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
clock
is
on
the
stroke
of
eleven
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
matter
 
I
'm
not
accustomed
to
go
to
bed
in
the
long
hours
.
<EOS>
One
or
two
is
early
enough
for
a
person
who
lies
till
ten
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
n't
lie
till
ten
.
<EOS>
There
's
the
very
prime
of
the
morning
gone
long
before
that
time
.
<EOS>
A
person
who
has
not
done
one
-
half
his
day
's
work
by
ten
o'clock
,
runs
a
chance
of
leaving
the
other
half
undone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nevertheless
,
Mrs.
Dean
,
resume
your
chair
;
because
to
-
morrow
I
intend
lengthening
the
night
till
afternoon
.
<EOS>
I
prognosticate
for
myself
an
obstinate
cold
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Well
,
you
must
allow
me
to
leap
over
some
three
years
;
during
that
space
Mrs.
Earnshaw
 
"
  
"
No
,
no
,
I
'll
allow
nothing
of
the
sort
!
<EOS>
Are
you
acquainted
with
the
mood
of
mind
in
which
,
if
you
were
seated
alone
,
and
the
cat
licking
its
kitten
on
the
rug
before
you
,
you
would
watch
the
operation
so
intently
that
puss
's
neglect
of
one
ear
would
put
you
seriously
out
of
temper
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
A
terribly
lazy
mood
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
a
tiresomely
active
one
.
<EOS>
It
is
mine
,
at
present
;
and
,
therefore
,
continue
minutely
.
<EOS>
I
perceive
that
people
in
these
regions
acquire
over
people
in
towns
the
value
that
a
spider
in
a
dungeon
does
over
a
spider
in
a
cottage
,
to
their
various
occupants
;
and
yet
the
deepened
attraction
is
not
entirely
owing
to
the
situation
of
the
looker
-
on
.
<EOS>
They
_
do
_
live
more
in
earnest
,
<EOS>
more
in
themselves
,
and
less
in
surface
,
change
,
and
frivolous
external
things
.
<EOS>
I
could
fancy
a
love
for
life
here
almost
possible
;
and
I
was
a
fixed
unbeliever
in
any
love
of
a
year
's
standing
.
<EOS>
One
state
resembles
setting
a
hungry
man
down
to
a
single
dish
,
on
which
he
may
concentrate
his
entire
appetite
and
do
it
justice
;
the
other
,
introducing
him
to
a
table
laid
out
by
French
cooks
<EOS>
:
he
can
perhaps
extract
as
much
enjoyment
from
the
whole
;
but
each
part
is
a
mere
atom
in
his
regard
and
remembrance
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
here
we
are
the
same
as
anywhere
else
,
when
you
get
to
know
us
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Dean
,
somewhat
puzzled
at
my
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
"
I
responded
;
"
you
,
my
good
friend
,
are
a
striking
evidence
against
that
assertion
.
<EOS>
Excepting
a
few
provincialisms
of
slight
consequence
,
you
have
no
marks
of
the
manners
which
I
am
habituated
to
consider
as
peculiar
to
your
class
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
have
thought
a
great
deal
more
than
<EOS>
the
generality
of
servants
think
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
compelled
to
cultivate
your
reflective
faculties
for
want
of
occasions
for
frittering
your
life
away
in
silly
trifles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dean
laughed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
esteem
myself
a
steady
,
reasonable
kind
of
body
,
"
she
said
;
"
not
exactly
from
living
among
the
hills
and
seeing
one
set
of
faces
,
and
one
series
of
actions
,
from
year
's
end
to
year
's
end
;
but
I
have
undergone
sharp
discipline
,
which
has
taught
me
wisdom
;
and
then
,
I
have
read
more
than
you
would
fancy
,
Mr.
Lockwood
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
open
a
book
in
this
library
that
I
have
not
looked
into
,
and
got
something
out
of
also
:
unless
it
be
that
range
of
Greek
and
Latin
,
and
that
of
French
;
and
those
I
know
one
from
another
:
it
is
as
much
as
you
can
expect
of
a
poor
man
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
However
,
if
I
am
to
follow
my
story
in
true
gossip
's
fashion
,
I
had
better
go
on
;
and
instead
of
leaping
three
years
,
I
will
be
content
to
pass
to
the
next
summer
 
the
summer
of
1778
,
that
is
nearly
twenty
-
three
years
ago
.
"
    
<EOS>
On
the
morning
of
a
fine
June
day
my
first
bonny
little
nursling
,
and
the
last
of
the
ancient
Earnshaw
stock
,
was
born
.
<EOS>
We
were
busy
with
the
hay
in
a
far
-
away
field
,
when
the
girl
that
usually
brought
our
breakfasts
came
running
an
hour
too
soon
across
the
meadow
and
up
the
lane
,
calling
me
as
she
ran
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
such
a
grand
bairn
!
<EOS>
"
she
panted
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
finest
lad
that
ever
breathed
!
<EOS>
But
the
doctor
says
missis
must
go
:
he
says
she
's
been
in
a
consumption
these
many
months
.
<EOS>
I
heard
him
tell
Mr.
Hindley
:
and
now
she
has
nothing
to
keep
her
,
and
she
'll
be
dead
before
winter
.
<EOS>
You
must
come
home
directly
.
<EOS>
You
're
to
nurse
it
,
Nelly
:
to
feed
it
with
sugar
and
milk
,
and
take
care
of
it
day
and
night
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
were
you
,
because
it
will
be
all
yours
when
there
is
no
missis
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
is
she
very
ill
?
"
<EOS>
I
asked
,
flinging
down
my
rake
and
tying
my
bonnet
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
guess
she
is
;
yet
she
looks
bravely
,
"
replied
the
girl
,
"
and
she
talks
as
if
she
thought
of
living
to
see
it
grow
a
man
.
<EOS>
She
's
out
of
her
head
for
joy
,
it
's
such
a
beauty
!
<EOS>
If
I
were
her
<EOS>
I
'm
certain
<EOS>
I
should
not
die
<EOS>
:
I
should
get
better
at
the
bare
sight
of
it
,
in
spite
of
Kenneth
.
<EOS>
I
was
fairly
mad
at
him
.
<EOS>
Dame
Archer
brought
the
cherub
down
to
master
,
in
the
house
,
and
his
face
just
began
to
light
up
,
when
the
old
croaker
steps
forward
,
and
says
he
 
<EOS>
"
Earnshaw
,
it
's
a
blessing
your
wife
has
been
spared
to
leave
you
this
son
.
<EOS>
When
she
came
,
I
felt
convinced
we
should
n't
keep
her
long
;
and
now
,
I
must
tell
you
,
the
winter
will
probably
finish
her
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
take
on
,
and
fret
about
it
too
much
:
it
ca
n't
be
helped
.
<EOS>
And
besides
,
you
should
have
known
better
than
to
choose
such
a
rush
of
a
lass
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
did
the
master
answer
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
swore
:
<EOS>
but
I
did
n't
mind
him
,
I
was
straining
to
see
the
bairn
,
"
and
she
began
again
to
describe
it
rapturously
.
<EOS>
I
,
as
zealous
as
herself
,
hurried
eagerly
home
to
admire
,
on
my
part
;
though
I
was
very
sad
for
Hindley
's
sake
.
<EOS>
He
had
room
in
his
heart
only
for
two
idols
 
his
wife
and
himself
:
he
doted
on
both
,
and
adored
one
,
and
I
could
n't
conceive
how
he
would
bear
the
loss
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
got
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
there
he
stood
at
the
front
door
;
and
,
as
I
passed
in
,
I
asked
,
"
how
was
the
baby
?
"
  
"
Nearly
ready
to
run
about
,
Nell
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
,
putting
on
a
cheerful
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
the
mistress
?
<EOS>
"
I
ventured
to
inquire
;
"
the
doctor
says
she
's
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Damn
the
doctor
!
"
<EOS>
he
interrupted
,
reddening
.
<EOS>
"
Frances
is
quite
right
:
she
'll
be
perfectly
well
by
this
time
next
week
.
<EOS>
Are
you
going
up
-
stairs
?
<EOS>
will
you
tell
her
that
I
'll
come
,
if
she
'll
promise
not
to
talk
.
<EOS>
I
left
her
because
she
would
not
hold
her
tongue
;
and
she
must
 
tell
her
Mr.
Kenneth
says
she
must
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
delivered
this
message
to
Mrs.
Earnshaw
;
she
seemed
in
flighty
spirits
,
and
replied
merrily
,
"
I
hardly
spoke
a
word
,
Ellen
,
and
there
he
has
gone
out
twice
,
crying
.
<EOS>
Well
,
say
I
promise
I
wo
n't
speak
:
but
that
does
not
bind
me
not
to
laugh
at
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
soul
!
<EOS>
Till
within
a
week
of
her
death
that
gay
heart
never
failed
her
;
and
her
husband
persisted
doggedly
,
nay
,
furiously
,
in
affirming
her
health
improved
every
day
.
<EOS>
When
Kenneth
warned
him
that
his
medicines
were
useless
at
that
stage
of
the
malady
,
and
he
need
n't
put
him
to
further
expense
by
attending
her
,
he
retorted
,
"
I
know
you
need
not
 
<EOS>
she
's
well
 
<EOS>
she
does
not
want
any
more
attendance
from
you
!
<EOS>
She
never
was
in
a
consumption
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
fever
;
and
it
is
gone
:
her
pulse
is
as
slow
as
mine
now
,
and
her
cheek
as
cool
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
told
his
wife
the
same
story
,
and
she
seemed
to
believe
him
;
but
one
night
,
while
leaning
on
his
shoulder
,
in
the
act
of
saying
she
thought
she
should
be
able
to
get
up
to
-
morrow
,
a
fit
of
coughing
<EOS>
took
her
 
a
very
slight
one
 
<EOS>
he
raised
her
in
his
arms
;
she
put
her
two
hands
about
his
neck
,
her
face
changed
,
and
she
was
dead
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
girl
had
anticipated
,
the
child
Hareton
fell
wholly
into
my
hands
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Earnshaw
,
provided
he
saw
him
healthy
and
never
heard
him
cry
,
was
contented
,
as
far
as
regarded
him
.
<EOS>
For
himself
,
he
grew
desperate
:
<EOS>
his
sorrow
was
of
that
kind
that
will
not
lament
.
<EOS>
He
neither
wept
nor
prayed
;
he
cursed
and
defied
:
execrated
God
and
man
,
and
gave
himself
up
to
reckless
dissipation
.
<EOS>
The
servants
could
not
bear
his
tyrannical
and
evil
conduct
long
:
<EOS>
Joseph
and
I
were
the
only
two
that
would
stay
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
the
heart
to
leave
my
charge
;
and
besides
,
you
know
,
I
had
been
his
foster
-
sister
,
and
excused
his
behaviour
more
readily
than
a
stranger
would
.
<EOS>
Joseph
remained
to
hector
over
tenants
and
labourers
;
and
because
it
was
his
vocation
to
be
where
he
had
plenty
of
wickedness
to
reprove
.
  
<EOS>
The
master
's
bad
ways
and
bad
companions
formed
a
pretty
example
for
Catherine
and
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
His
treatment
of
the
latter
was
enough
to
make
a
fiend
of
a
saint
.
<EOS>
And
,
truly
,
it
appeared
as
if
the
lad
_
were
_
possessed
of
something
diabolical
at
that
period
.
<EOS>
He
delighted
to
witness
Hindley
degrading
himself
past
redemption
;
and
became
daily
more
notable
for
savage
sullenness
and
ferocity
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
half
tell
what
an
infernal
house
we
had
.
<EOS>
The
curate
dropped
calling
,
and
nobody
decent
came
near
us
,
at
last
;
unless
Edgar
Linton
's
visits
to
Miss
Cathy
might
be
an
exception
.
<EOS>
At
fifteen
she
was
the
queen
of
the
country
-
side
;
she
had
no
peer
;
and
she
did
turn
out
a
haughty
,
headstrong
creature
!
<EOS>
I
own
I
did
not
like
her
,
after
infancy
was
past
;
and
I
vexed
her
frequently
by
trying
to
bring
down
her
arrogance
:
she
never
took
an
aversion
to
me
,
though
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
wondrous
constancy
to
old
attachments
:
even
Heathcliff
kept
his
hold
on
her
affections
unalterably
;
and
young
Linton
,
with
all
his
superiority
,
found
it
difficult
to
make
an
equally
deep
impression
.
<EOS>
He
was
my
late
master
:
<EOS>
that
is
his
portrait
over
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
It
used
to
hang
on
one
side
,
and
his
wife
's
on
the
other
;
but
hers
has
been
removed
,
or
else
you
might
see
something
of
what
she
was
.
<EOS>
Can
you
make
that
out
?
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dean
raised
the
candle
,
and
I
discerned
a
soft
-
featured
face
,
exceedingly
resembling
the
young
lady
at
the
Heights
,
but
more
pensive
and
amiable
in
expression
.
<EOS>
It
formed
a
sweet
picture
.
<EOS>
The
long
light
hair
curled
slightly
on
the
temples
;
the
eyes
were
large
and
serious
;
the
figure
almost
too
graceful
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
marvel
how
Catherine
Earnshaw
could
forget
her
first
friend
for
such
an
individual
.
<EOS>
I
marvelled
much
how
he
,
with
a
mind
to
correspond
with
his
person
,
could
fancy
my
idea
of
Catherine
Earnshaw
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
agreeable
portrait
,
"
I
observed
to
the
house
-
keeper
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
answered
;
"
but
he
looked
better
when
he
was
animated
;
that
is
his
everyday
countenance
:
he
wanted
spirit
in
general
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
had
kept
up
her
acquaintance
with
the
Lintons
since
her
five
-
weeks
'
residence
among
them
;
and
as
she
had
no
temptation
to
show
her
rough
side
in
their
company
,
and
had
the
sense
to
be
ashamed
of
being
rude
where
she
experienced
such
invariable
courtesy
,
she
imposed
unwittingly
on
the
old
lady
and
gentleman
by
her
ingenious
cordiality
;
gained
the
admiration
of
Isabella
,
and
the
heart
and
soul
of
her
brother
:
acquisitions
that
flattered
her
from
the
first
 
<EOS>
for
she
was
full
of
ambition
 
and
led
her
to
adopt
a
double
character
without
exactly
intending
to
deceive
any
one
.
<EOS>
In
the
place
where
she
heard
Heathcliff
termed
a
"
vulgar
young
ruffian
,
"
and
"
worse
than
a
brute
,
"
she
took
care
not
to
act
like
him
;
but
at
home
she
had
small
inclination
to
practise
politeness
that
would
only
be
laughed
at
,
and
restrain
an
unruly
nature
when
it
would
bring
her
neither
credit
nor
praise
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Edgar
seldom
mustered
courage
to
visit
Wuthering
Heights
openly
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
terror
of
Earnshaw
's
reputation
,
and
shrunk
from
encountering
him
;
and
yet
he
was
always
received
with
our
best
attempts
at
civility
:
the
master
himself
avoided
offending
him
,
knowing
why
he
came
;
and
if
he
could
not
be
gracious
,
kept
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
I
rather
think
his
appearance
there
was
distasteful
to
Catherine
;
she
was
not
artful
,
never
played
the
coquette
,
and
had
evidently
an
objection
to
her
two
friends
meeting
at
all
;
for
when
Heathcliff
expressed
contempt
of
Linton
in
his
presence
,
she
could
not
half
coincide
,
as
she
did
in
his
absence
;
and
when
Linton
evinced
disgust
and
antipathy
to
Heathcliff
,
she
dared
not
treat
his
sentiments
with
indifference
,
as
if
depreciation
of
her
playmate
were
of
scarcely
any
consequence
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
've
had
many
a
laugh
at
her
perplexities
and
untold
troubles
,
which
she
vainly
strove
to
hide
from
my
mockery
.
<EOS>
That
sounds
ill
-
natured
:
but
she
was
so
proud
it
became
really
impossible
to
pity
her
distresses
,
till
she
should
be
chastened
into
more
humility
.
<EOS>
She
did
bring
herself
,
finally
,
to
confess
,
and
to
confide
in
me
:
there
was
not
a
soul
else
that
she
might
fashion
into
an
adviser
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Hindley
had
gone
from
home
one
afternoon
,
and
Heathcliff
presumed
to
give
himself
a
holiday
on
the
strength
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
reached
the
age
of
sixteen
then
,
I
think
,
and
without
having
bad
features
,
or
being
deficient
in
intellect
,
he
contrived
to
convey
an
impression
of
inward
and
outward
repulsiveness
that
his
present
aspect
retains
no
traces
of
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
he
had
by
that
time
lost
the
benefit
of
his
early
education
:
continual
hard
work
,
begun
soon
and
concluded
late
,
had
extinguished
any
curiosity
he
once
possessed
in
pursuit
of
knowledge
,
and
any
love
for
books
or
learning
.
<EOS>
His
childhood
's
sense
of
superiority
,
instilled
into
him
by
the
favours
of
old
Mr.
Earnshaw
,
was
faded
away
.
<EOS>
He
struggled
long
to
keep
up
an
equality
with
Catherine
in
her
studies
,
and
yielded
with
poignant
though
silent
regret
:
but
he
yielded
completely
;
and
there
was
no
prevailing
on
him
to
take
a
step
in
the
way
of
moving
upward
,
when
he
found
he
must
,
necessarily
,
sink
beneath
his
former
level
.
<EOS>
Then
personal
appearance
sympathised
with
mental
deterioration
:
he
acquired
a
slouching
gait
and
ignoble
look
;
his
naturally
reserved
disposition
was
exaggerated
into
an
almost
idiotic
excess
of
unsociable
moroseness
;
and
he
took
a
grim
pleasure
,
apparently
,
in
exciting
the
aversion
rather
than
the
esteem
of
his
few
acquaintances
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
and
he
were
constant
companions
still
at
his
seasons
of
respite
from
labour
;
but
he
had
ceased
to
express
his
fondness
for
her
in
words
,
and
recoiled
with
angry
suspicion
from
her
girlish
caresses
,
as
if
conscious
there
could
be
no
gratification
in
lavishing
such
marks
of
affection
on
him
.
<EOS>
On
the
before
-
named
occasion
he
came
into
the
house
to
announce
his
intention
of
doing
nothing
,
while
I
was
assisting
Miss
Cathy
to
arrange
her
dress
:
she
had
not
reckoned
on
his
taking
it
into
his
head
to
be
idle
;
and
imagining
she
would
have
the
whole
place
to
herself
,
she
managed
,
by
some
means
,
to
inform
Mr.
Edgar
of
her
brother
's
absence
,
and
was
then
preparing
to
receive
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cathy
,
are
you
busy
this
afternoon
?
"
asked
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
anywhere
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
is
raining
,
"
she
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
have
you
that
silk
frock
on
,
then
?
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Nobody
coming
here
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
know
of
,
"
stammered
Miss
:
"
but
you
should
be
in
the
field
now
,
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
hour
past
dinnertime
:
I
thought
you
were
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hindley
does
not
often
free
us
from
his
accursed
presence
,
"
observed
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
work
any
more
to
-
day
:
I
'll
stay
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
Joseph
will
tell
,
"
she
suggested
;
"
you
'd
better
go
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Joseph
is
loading
lime
on
the
further
side
of
Penistone
Crags
;
it
will
take
him
till
dark
,
and
he
'll
never
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
,
saying
,
he
lounged
to
the
fire
,
and
sat
down
.
<EOS>
Catherine
reflected
an
instant
,
with
knitted
brows
 
<EOS>
she
found
it
needful
to
smooth
the
way
for
an
intrusion
.
<EOS>
"
Isabella
and
Edgar
Linton
talked
of
calling
this
afternoon
,
"
she
said
,
at
the
conclusion
of
a
minute
's
silence
.
"
<EOS>
As
it
rains
,
I
hardly
expect
them
;
but
they
may
come
,
and
if
they
do
,
you
run
the
risk
of
being
scolded
for
no
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Order
Ellen
to
say
you
are
engaged
,
Cathy
<EOS>
,
"
he
persisted
;
"
do
n't
turn
me
out
for
those
pitiful
,
silly
friends
of
yours
!
<EOS>
I
'm
on
the
point
,
sometimes
,
of
complaining
that
they
 
<EOS>
but
I
'll
not
 
"
  
"
That
they
what
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Catherine
,
gazing
at
him
with
a
troubled
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Nelly
!
"
<EOS>
she
added
petulantly
,
jerking
her
head
away
from
my
hands
,
"
you
've
combed
my
hair
quite
out
of
curl
!
<EOS>
That
's
enough
;
let
me
alone
.
<EOS>
What
are
you
on
the
point
of
complaining
about
,
Heathcliff
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
 
only
look
at
the
almanack
on
that
wall
;
"
he
pointed
to
a
framed
sheet
hanging
near
the
window
,
and
continued
,
"
The
crosses
are
for
the
evenings
you
have
spent
with
the
Lintons
,
the
dots
for
those
spent
with
me
.
<EOS>
Do
you
see
?
<EOS>
I
've
marked
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
very
foolish
:
as
if
I
took
notice
!
"
replied
Catherine
,
in
a
peevish
tone
.
"
<EOS>
And
where
is
the
sense
of
that
?
"
  
"
To
show
that
I
_
do
_
take
notice
,
"
said
Heathcliff
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
should
I
always
be
sitting
with
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
demanded
,
growing
more
irritated
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
good
do
I
get
?
<EOS>
What
do
you
talk
about
?
<EOS>
You
might
be
dumb
,
or
a
baby
,
for
anything
you
say
to
amuse
me
,
or
for
anything
you
do
,
either
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
told
me
before
that
I
talked
too
little
,
or
that
you
disliked
my
company
,
Cathy
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Heathcliff
,
in
much
agitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
company
at
all
,
when
people
know
nothing
and
say
nothing
,
"
she
muttered
.
  
<EOS>
Her
companion
rose
up
,
but
he
had
n't
time
to
express
his
feelings
further
,
for
a
horse
's
feet
were
heard
on
the
flags
,
and
having
knocked
gently
,
young
Linton
entered
,
his
face
brilliant
with
delight
at
the
unexpected
summon
she
had
received
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
Catherine
marked
the
difference
between
her
friends
,
as
one
came
in
and
the
other
went
out
.
<EOS>
The
contrast
resembled
what
you
see
in
exchanging
a
bleak
,
hilly
,
coal
country
for
a
beautiful
fertile
valley
;
and
his
voice
and
greeting
were
as
opposite
as
his
aspect
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
sweet
,
low
manner
of
speaking
,
and
pronounced
his
words
as
you
do
:
that
's
less
gruff
than
we
talk
here
,
and
softer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
come
too
soon
,
am
I
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
casting
a
look
at
me
:
I
had
begun
to
wipe
the
plate
,
and
tidy
some
drawers
at
the
far
end
in
the
dresser
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
answered
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
doing
there
,
Nelly
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
work
,
Miss
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
(
Mr.
Hindley
had
given
me
directions
to
make
a
third
party
in
any
private
visits
Linton
chose
to
pay
.
)
  
<EOS>
She
stepped
behind
me
and
whispered
crossly
,
"
Take
yourself
and
your
dusters
off
;
when
company
are
in
the
house
,
servants
do
n't
commence
scouring
and
cleaning
in
the
room
where
they
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
good
opportunity
,
now
that
master
is
away
,
"
I
answered
aloud
:
"
he
hates
me
to
be
fidgeting
over
these
things
in
his
presence
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
Mr.
Edgar
will
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
you
to
be
fidgeting
in
_
<EOS>
my
_
presence
,
"
exclaimed
the
young
lady
imperiously
,
not
allowing
her
guest
time
to
speak
:
she
had
failed
to
recover
her
equanimity
since
the
little
dispute
with
Heathcliff
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
for
it
,
Miss
Catherine
,
"
was
my
response
;
and
I
proceeded
assiduously
with
my
occupation
.
  
<EOS>
She
,
supposing
Edgar
could
not
see
her
,
snatched
the
cloth
from
my
hand
,
and
pinched
me
,
with
a
prolonged
wrench
,
very
spitefully
on
the
arm
.
<EOS>
I
've
said
I
did
not
love
her
,
and
rather
relished
mortifying
her
vanity
now
<EOS>
and
then
:
besides
,
she
hurt
me
extremely
;
so
I
started
up
from
my
knees
,
and
screamed
out
,
"
Oh
,
Miss
,
that
's
a
nasty
trick
!
<EOS>
You
have
no
right
to
nip
me
,
and
I
'm
not
going
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
touch
you
,
<EOS>
you
lying
creature
!
"
<EOS>
cried
she
,
her
fingers
tingling
to
repeat
the
act
,
and
her
ears
red
with
rage
.
<EOS>
She
never
had
power
to
conceal
her
passion
,
it
always
set
her
whole
complexion
in
a
blaze
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
retorted
,
showing
a
decided
purple
witness
to
refute
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
stamped
her
foot
,
wavered
a
moment
,
and
then
,
irresistibly
impelled
by
the
naughty
spirit
within
her
,
slapped
me
on
the
cheek
:
<EOS>
a
stinging
blow
that
filled
both
eyes
with
water
.
  
<EOS>
"
Catherine
,
love
!
<EOS>
Catherine
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Linton
,
greatly
shocked
at
the
double
fault
of
falsehood
and
violence
which
his
idol
had
committed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
the
room
,
Ellen
!
"
<EOS>
she
repeated
,
trembling
all
over
.
  
<EOS>
Little
Hareton
,
who
followed
me
everywhere
,
and
was
sitting
near
me
on
the
floor
,
at
seeing
my
tears
commenced
crying
himself
,
and
sobbed
out
complaints
against
"
wicked
aunt
Cathy
,
"
which
drew
her
fury
on
to
his
unlucky
head
:
<EOS>
she
seized
his
shoulders
,
and
shook
him
till
the
poor
child
waxed
livid
,
and
Edgar
thoughtlessly
laid
hold
of
her
hands
to
deliver
him
.
<EOS>
In
an
instant
one
was
wrung
free
,
and
the
astonished
young
man
felt
it
applied
over
his
own
ear
in
a
way
that
could
not
be
mistaken
for
jest
.
<EOS>
He
drew
back
in
consternation
.
<EOS>
I
lifted
Hareton
in
my
arms
,
and
walked
off
to
the
kitchen
with
him
,
leaving
the
door
of
communication
open
,
for
I
was
curious
to
watch
how
they
would
settle
their
disagreement
.
<EOS>
The
insulted
visitor
moved
to
the
spot
where
he
had
laid
his
hat
,
pale
and
with
a
quivering
lip
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
to
myself
.
"
<EOS>
Take
warning
and
begone
!
<EOS>
It
's
a
kindness
to
let
you
have
a
glimpse
of
her
genuine
disposition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
?
"
demanded
Catherine
,
advancing
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
He
swerved
aside
,
and
attempted
to
pass
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
go
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
energetically
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
and
shall
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
in
a
subdued
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
persisted
,
grasping
the
handle
;
"
not
yet
,
Edgar
Linton
:
sit
down
;
you
shall
not
leave
me
in
that
temper
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
miserable
all
night
,
and
I
wo
n't
be
miserable
for
you
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
stay
after
you
have
struck
me
?
"
asked
Linton
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
was
mute
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
made
me
afraid
and
ashamed
of
you
,
"
he
continued
;
"
I
'll
not
come
here
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
Her
eyes
began
to
glisten
and
her
lids
to
twinkle
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
told
a
deliberate
untruth
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
recovering
her
speech
;
"
I
did
nothing
deliberately
.
<EOS>
Well
,
go
,
if
you
please
 
get
away
!
<EOS>
And
now
I
'll
cry
 
<EOS>
I
'll
cry
myself
sick
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
dropped
down
on
her
knees
by
a
chair
,
and
set
to
weeping
in
serious
earnest
.
<EOS>
Edgar
persevered
in
his
resolution
as
far
as
the
court
;
there
he
lingered
.
<EOS>
I
resolved
to
encourage
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
is
dreadfully
wayward
,
sir
,
"
I
called
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
bad
as
any
marred
child
:
you
'd
better
be
riding
home
,
or
else
she
will
be
sick
,
only
to
grieve
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
soft
thing
looked
askance
through
the
window
:
he
possessed
the
power
to
depart
as
much
as
a
cat
possesses
the
power
to
leave
a
mouse
half
killed
,
or
a
bird
half
eaten
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
I
thought
,
there
will
be
no
saving
him
:
he
's
doomed
,
and
flies
to
his
fate
!
<EOS>
And
so
it
was
:
he
turned
abruptly
,
hastened
into
the
house
again
,
shut
the
door
behind
him
;
and
when
I
went
in
a
while
after
to
inform
them
that
Earnshaw
had
come
home
rabid
drunk
,
ready
to
pull
the
whole
place
about
our
ears
(
his
ordinary
frame
of
mind
in
that
condition
)
,
I
saw
the
quarrel
had
merely
effected
a
closer
intimacy
 
had
broken
the
outworks
of
youthful
timidity
,
and
enabled
them
to
forsake
the
disguise
of
friendship
,
and
confess
themselves
lovers
.
  
<EOS>
Intelligence
of
Mr.
Hindley
's
arrival
drove
Linton
speedily
to
his
horse
,
and
Catherine
to
her
chamber
.
<EOS>
I
went
to
hide
little
Hareton
,
and
to
take
the
shot
out
of
the
master
's
fowling
-
piece
,
which
he
was
fond
of
playing
with
in
his
insane
excitement
,
to
the
hazard
of
the
lives
of
any
who
provoked
,
or
even
attracted
his
notice
too
much
;
and
I
had
hit
upon
the
plan
of
removing
it
,
that
he
might
do
less
mischief
if
he
did
go
the
length
of
firing
the
gun
.
    
<EOS>
He
entered
,
vociferating
oaths
dreadful
to
hear
;
and
caught
me
in
the
act
of
stowing
his
son
away
in
the
kitchen
cupboard
.
<EOS>
Hareton
was
impressed
with
a
wholesome
terror
of
encountering
either
his
wild
beast
's
fondness
or
his
madman
's
rage
;
for
in
one
he
ran
a
chance
of
being
squeezed
and
kissed
to
death
,
and
in
the
other
of
being
flung
into
the
fire
,
or
dashed
against
the
wall
;
and
the
poor
thing
remained
perfectly
quiet
wherever
I
chose
to
put
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
I
've
found
it
out
at
last
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hindley
,
pulling
me
back
by
the
skin
of
my
neck
,
like
a
dog
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
heaven
and
hell
,
you
've
sworn
between
you
to
murder
that
child
!
<EOS>
I
know
how
it
is
,
now
,
that
he
is
always
out
of
my
way
.
<EOS>
But
,
with
the
help
of
Satan
,
I
shall
make
you
swallow
the
carving
-
knife
,
Nelly
!
<EOS>
You
need
n't
laugh
;
for
I
've
just
crammed
Kenneth
,
head
-
downmost
,
in
the
Black
-
horse
marsh
;
and
two
is
the
same
as
one
 
<EOS>
and
I
want
to
kill
some
of
you
<EOS>
:
I
shall
have
no
rest
till
I
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
like
the
carving
-
knife
,
Mr.
Hindley
,
"
I
answered
;
"
it
has
been
cutting
red
herrings
.
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
be
shot
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'd
rather
be
damned
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
;
"
and
so
you
shall
.
<EOS>
No
law
in
England
can
hinder
a
man
from
keeping
his
house
decent
,
and
mine
's
abominable
!
<EOS>
Open
your
mouth
.
"
<EOS>
He
held
the
knife
in
his
hand
,
and
pushed
its
point
between
my
teeth
:
but
,
for
my
part
,
I
was
never
much
afraid
of
his
vagaries
.
<EOS>
I
spat
out
,
and
affirmed
it
tasted
detestably
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
take
it
on
any
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
he
,
releasing
me
,
"
I
see
that
hideous
little
villain
is
not
Hareton
:
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Nell
.
<EOS>
If
it
be
,
he
deserves
flaying
alive
for
not
running
to
welcome
me
,
and
for
screaming
as
if
I
were
a
goblin
.
<EOS>
Unnatural
cub
,
come
hither
!
<EOS>
I
'll
teach
thee
to
impose
on
a
good
-
hearted
,
deluded
father
.
<EOS>
Now
,
do
n't
you
think
the
lad
would
be
handsomer
cropped
?
<EOS>
It
makes
a
dog
fiercer
,
and
I
love
something
fierce
 
<EOS>
get
me
a
scissors
 
something
fierce
and
trim
!
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
's
infernal
affectation
 
<EOS>
devilish
conceit
<EOS>
it
is
,
to
cherish
our
ears
 
we
're
asses
enough
without
them
.
<EOS>
Hush
,
child
,
hush
!
<EOS>
Well
then
,
it
is
my
darling
!
<EOS>
wisht
,
dry
thy
eyes
 
<EOS>
there
's
a
joy
;
kiss
me
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
it
wo
n't
?
<EOS>
Kiss
me
,
Hareton
!
<EOS>
Damn
thee
,
kiss
me
!
<EOS>
By
God
,
as
if
I
would
rear
such
a
monster
!
<EOS>
As
sure
as
I
'm
living
,
I
'll
break
the
brat
's
neck
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Hareton
was
squalling
and
kicking
in
his
father
's
arms
with
all
his
might
,
and
redoubled
his
yells
when
he
carried
him
up
-
stairs
and
lifted
him
over
the
banister
.
<EOS>
I
cried
out
that
he
would
frighten
the
child
into
fits
,
and
ran
to
rescue
him
.
<EOS>
As
I
reached
them
,
Hindley
leant
forward
on
the
rails
to
listen
to
a
noise
below
;
almost
forgetting
what
he
had
in
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
is
that
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
hearing
some
one
approaching
the
stairs'-foot
.
<EOS>
I
leant
forward
also
,
for
the
purpose
of
signing
to
Heathcliff
,
whose
step
I
recognised
,
not
to
come
further
;
and
,
at
the
instant
when
my
eye
quitted
Hareton
,
he
gave
a
sudden
spring
,
delivered
himself
from
the
careless
grasp
that
held
him
,
and
fell
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
scarcely
time
to
experience
a
thrill
of
horror
before
we
saw
that
the
little
wretch
was
safe
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
arrived
underneath
just
at
the
critical
moment
;
by
a
natural
impulse
he
arrested
his
descent
,
and
setting
him
on
his
feet
,
looked
up
to
discover
the
author
of
the
accident
.
<EOS>
A
miser
who
has
parted
with
a
lucky
lottery
ticket
for
five
shillings
,
and
finds
next
day
he
has
lost
in
the
bargain
five
thousand
pounds
,
could
not
show
a
blanker
countenance
than
he
did
on
beholding
the
figure
of
Mr.
Earnshaw
above
.
<EOS>
It
expressed
,
plainer
than
words
could
do
,
the
intensest
anguish
at
having
made
himself
the
instrument
of
thwarting
his
own
revenge
.
<EOS>
Had
it
been
dark
,
I
daresay
he
would
have
tried
to
remedy
the
mistake
by
smashing
Hareton
's
skull
on
the
steps
;
but
,
we
witnessed
his
salvation
;
and
I
was
presently
below
with
my
precious
charge
pressed
to
my
heart
.
<EOS>
Hindley
descended
more
leisurely
,
sobered
and
abashed
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
your
fault
,
Ellen
,
"
he
said
;
"
you
should
have
kept
him
out
of
sight
:
you
should
have
taken
him
from
me
!
<EOS>
Is
he
injured
anywhere
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Injured
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
angrily
;
"
if
he
is
not
killed
,
he
'll
be
an
idiot
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
his
mother
does
not
rise
from
her
grave
to
see
how
you
use
him
.
<EOS>
You
're
worse
than
a
heathen
 
treating
your
own
flesh
and
blood
in
that
manner
!
"
<EOS>
He
attempted
to
touch
the
child
,
who
,
on
finding
himself
with
me
,
sobbed
off
his
terror
directly
.
<EOS>
At
the
first
finger
his
father
laid
on
him
,
however
,
he
shrieked
again
louder
than
before
,
and
struggled
as
if
he
would
go
into
convulsions
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
meddle
with
him
!
"
<EOS>
I
continued
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
hates
you
 
<EOS>
they
all
hate
you
 
<EOS>
that
's
the
truth
!
<EOS>
A
happy
family
you
have
;
and
a
pretty
state
you
're
come
to
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
come
to
a
prettier
,
yet
,
Nelly
,
"
laughed
the
misguided
man
,
recovering
his
hardness
.
<EOS>
"
At
present
,
convey
yourself
and
him
away
.
<EOS>
And
hark
you
,
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
clear
you
too
quite
from
my
reach
and
hearing
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
murder
you
to
-
night
;
unless
,
perhaps
,
I
set
the
house
on
fire
:
but
that
's
as
my
fancy
goes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
While
saying
this
he
took
a
pint
bottle
of
brandy
from
the
dresser
,
and
poured
some
into
a
tumbler
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
do
n't
!
<EOS>
"
I
entreated
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Hindley
,
do
take
warning
.
<EOS>
Have
mercy
on
this
unfortunate
boy
,
if
you
care
nothing
for
yourself
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Any
one
will
do
better
for
him
than
I
shall
,
"
he
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
mercy
on
your
own
soul
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
endeavouring
to
snatch
the
glass
from
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
I
!
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
I
shall
have
great
pleasure
in
sending
it
to
perdition
to
punish
its
Maker
,
"
exclaimed
the
blasphemer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
's
to
its
hearty
damnation
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
drank
the
spirits
and
impatiently
bade
us
go
;
terminating
his
command
with
a
sequel
of
horrid
imprecations
too
bad
to
repeat
or
remember
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
pity
he
can
not
kill
himself
with
drink
,
"
observed
Heathcliff
,
muttering
an
echo
of
curses
back
when
the
door
was
shut
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
doing
his
very
utmost
;
but
his
constitution
defies
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kenneth
says
he
would
wager
his
mare
that
he
'll
outlive
any
man
on
this
side
Gimmerton
,
and
go
to
the
grave
a
hoary
sinner
;
unless
some
happy
chance
out
of
the
common
course
befall
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
went
into
the
kitchen
,
and
sat
down
to
lull
my
little
lamb
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
,
as
I
thought
,
walked
through
to
the
barn
.
<EOS>
It
turned
out
afterwards
that
he
only
got
as
far
as
the
other
side
the
settle
,
when
he
flung
himself
on
a
bench
by
the
wall
,
removed
from
the
fire
and
remained
silent
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
rocking
Hareton
on
my
knee
,
and
humming
a
song
that
began
,
    
<EOS>
It
was
far
in
the
night
,
and
the
bairnies
grat
,
The
mither
beneath
the
mools
heard
that
,
  
when
Miss
Cathy
,
who
had
listened
to
the
hubbub
from
her
room
,
put
her
head
in
,
and
whispered
,
 
"
Are
you
alone
,
Nelly
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Miss
,
"
I
replied
.
  
<EOS>
She
entered
and
approached
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
I
,
supposing
she
was
going
to
say
something
,
looked
up
.
<EOS>
The
expression
of
her
face
seemed
disturbed
and
anxious
.
<EOS>
Her
lips
were
half
asunder
,
as
if
she
meant
to
speak
,
and
she
drew
a
breath
;
but
it
escaped
in
a
sigh
instead
of
a
sentence
.
<EOS>
I
resumed
my
song
;
not
having
forgotten
her
recent
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
's
Heathcliff
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
interrupting
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
About
his
work
in
the
stable
,
"
was
my
answer
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
contradict
me
;
perhaps
he
had
fallen
into
a
doze
.
<EOS>
There
followed
another
long
pause
,
during
which
I
perceived
a
drop
or
two
trickle
from
Catherine
's
cheek
to
the
flags
.
<EOS>
Is
she
sorry
for
her
shameful
conduct
?
 
<EOS>
I
asked
myself
.
<EOS>
That
will
be
a
novelty
:
but
she
may
come
to
the
point
 
as
she
will
 
<EOS>
I
sha'n't
help
her
!
<EOS>
No
,
she
felt
small
trouble
regarding
any
subject
,
save
her
own
concerns
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cried
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
unhappy
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
pity
,
"
observed
I.
"
<EOS>
You
're
hard
to
please
;
so
many
friends
and
so
few
cares
,
and
ca
n't
make
yourself
content
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nelly
,
will
you
keep
a
secret
for
me
?
"
<EOS>
she
pursued
,
kneeling
down
by
me
,
and
lifting
her
winsome
eyes
to
my
face
with
that
sort
of
look
which
turns
off
bad
temper
,
even
when
one
has
all
the
right
in
the
world
to
indulge
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
worth
keeping
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
less
sulkily
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
it
worries
me
,
and
I
must
let
it
out
!
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
what
I
should
do
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
,
Edgar
Linton
has
asked
me
to
marry
him
,
and
I
've
given
him
an
answer
.
<EOS>
Now
,
before
I
tell
you
whether
it
was
a
consent
or
denial
,
you
tell
me
which
it
ought
to
have
been
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Really
,
Miss
Catherine
,
how
can
I
know
?
<EOS>
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
considering
the
exhibition
you
performed
in
his
presence
this
afternoon
,
I
might
say
it
would
be
wise
to
refuse
him
:
since
he
asked
you
after
that
,
he
must
either
be
hopelessly
stupid
or
a
venturesome
fool
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
talk
so
,
I
wo
n't
tell
you
any
more
,
"
she
returned
,
peevishly
rising
to
her
feet
.
<EOS>
"
I
accepted
him
,
Nelly
.
<EOS>
Be
quick
,
and
say
whether
I
was
wrong
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
accepted
him
!
<EOS>
Then
what
good
is
it
discussing
the
matter
?
<EOS>
You
have
pledged
your
word
,
and
can
not
retract
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
say
whether
I
should
have
done
so
 
do
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
in
an
irritated
tone
;
chafing
her
hands
together
,
and
frowning
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
many
things
to
be
considered
before
that
question
can
be
answered
properly
,
"
I
said
,
sententiously
.
<EOS>
"
First
and
foremost
,
do
you
love
Mr.
Edgar
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
can
help
it
?
<EOS>
Of
course
I
do
,
"
she
answered
.
  
<EOS>
Then
I
put
her
through
the
following
catechism
:
for
a
girl
of
twenty
-
two
it
was
not
injudicious
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
love
him
,
Miss
Cathy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
I
do
 
<EOS>
that
's
sufficient
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
;
you
must
say
why
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
,
because
he
is
handsome
,
and
pleasant
to
be
with
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bad
!
"
was
my
commentary
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
because
he
is
young
and
cheerful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bad
,
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
because
he
loves
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indifferent
,
coming
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
will
be
rich
,
and
I
shall
like
to
be
the
greatest
woman
of
the
neighbourhood
,
and
I
shall
be
proud
of
having
such
a
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Worst
of
all
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
say
how
you
love
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
everybody
loves
 
You
're
silly
,
Nelly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
 
Answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
love
the
ground
under
his
feet
,
and
the
air
over
his
head
,
and
everything
he
touches
,
and
every
word
he
says
.
<EOS>
I
love
all
his
looks
,
and
all
his
actions
,
and
him
entirely
and
altogether
.
<EOS>
There
now
!
"
  
"
And
why
?
"
  
"
Nay
;
you
are
making
a
jest
of
it
:
it
is
exceedingly
ill
-
natured
!
<EOS>
It
's
no
jest
to
me
!
"
said
the
young
lady
,
scowling
,
and
turning
her
face
to
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
far
from
jesting
,
Miss
Catherine
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
You
love
Mr.
Edgar
because
he
is
handsome
,
and
young
,
and
cheerful
,
and
rich
,
and
loves
you
.
<EOS>
The
last
,
however
,
goes
for
nothing
:
you
would
love
him
without
that
,
probably
;
and
with
it
you
would
n't
,
unless
he
possessed
the
four
former
attractions
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
to
be
sure
not
:
I
should
only
pity
him
 
hate
him
,
perhaps
,
if
he
were
ugly
,
and
a
clown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
are
several
other
handsome
,
rich
young
men
in
the
world
:
handsomer
,
possibly
,
and
richer
than
he
is
.
<EOS>
What
should
hinder
you
from
loving
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
there
be
any
,
they
are
out
of
my
way
:
I
've
seen
none
like
Edgar
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
see
some
;
and
he
wo
n't
always
be
handsome
,
and
young
,
and
may
not
always
be
rich
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
now
;
and
I
have
only
to
do
with
the
present
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
speak
rationally
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
that
settles
it
:
if
you
have
only
to
do
with
the
present
,
marry
Mr.
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
your
permission
for
that
 
<EOS>
I
_
shall
_
marry
him
:
<EOS>
and
yet
you
have
not
told
me
whether
I
'm
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
right
;
if
people
be
right
to
marry
only
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
let
us
hear
what
you
are
unhappy
about
.
<EOS>
Your
brother
will
be
pleased
;
the
old
lady
and
gentleman
will
not
object
,
I
think
;
you
will
escape
from
a
disorderly
,
comfortless
home
into
a
wealthy
,
respectable
one
;
and
you
love
Edgar
,
and
Edgar
loves
you
.
<EOS>
All
seems
smooth
and
easy
:
where
is
the
obstacle
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Here
_
!
<EOS>
and
_
here
_
!
<EOS>
"
replied
Catherine
,
striking
one
hand
on
her
forehead
,
and
the
other
on
her
breast
:
"
in
whichever
place
the
soul
lives
.
<EOS>
In
my
soul
and
in
my
heart
,
I
'm
convinced
I
'm
wrong
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
very
strange
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
make
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
secret
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
will
not
mock
at
me
,
I
'll
explain
it
:
I
ca
n't
do
it
distinctly
;
but
I
'll
give
you
a
feeling
of
how
I
feel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
seated
herself
by
me
again
:
her
countenance
grew
sadder
and
graver
,
and
her
clasped
hands
trembled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nelly
,
do
you
never
dream
queer
dreams
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
suddenly
,
after
some
minutes
'
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
now
and
then
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
so
do
I.
<EOS>
I
've
dreamt
in
my
life
dreams
that
have
stayed
with
me
ever
after
,
and
changed
my
ideas
<EOS>
:
they
've
gone
through
and
through
me
,
like
wine
through
water
,
and
altered
the
colour
of
my
mind
.
<EOS>
And
this
is
one
:
I
'm
going
to
tell
it
 
but
take
care
not
to
smile
at
any
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
do
n't
,
Miss
Catherine
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
.
<EOS>
"
We
're
dismal
enough
without
conjuring
up
ghosts
and
visions
to
perplex
us
.
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
<EOS>
be
merry
and
like
yourself
!
<EOS>
Look
at
little
Hareton
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
he
's
_
dreaming
nothing
dreary
.
<EOS>
How
sweetly
he
smiles
in
his
sleep
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
and
how
sweetly
his
father
curses
in
his
solitude
!
<EOS>
You
remember
him
,
I
daresay
,
when
he
was
just
such
another
as
that
chubby
thing
:
nearly
as
young
and
innocent
.
<EOS>
However
,
Nelly
,
I
shall
oblige
you
to
listen
:
it
's
not
long
;
and
I
've
no
power
to
be
merry
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
hear
it
,
I
wo
n't
hear
it
!
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
,
hastily
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
superstitious
about
dreams
then
,
and
am
still
;
and
Catherine
had
an
unusual
gloom
in
her
aspect
,
that
made
me
dread
something
from
which
I
might
shape
a
prophecy
,
and
foresee
a
fearful
catastrophe
.
<EOS>
She
was
vexed
,
but
she
did
not
proceed
.
<EOS>
Apparently
taking
up
another
subject
,
she
recommenced
in
a
short
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
in
heaven
,
Nelly
,
I
should
be
extremely
miserable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
you
are
not
fit
to
go
there
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
All
sinners
would
be
miserable
in
heaven
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
not
for
that
.
<EOS>
I
dreamt
once
that
I
was
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
I
wo
n't
hearken
to
your
dreams
,
Miss
Catherine
!
<EOS>
I
'll
go
to
bed
,
"
I
interrupted
again
.
  
<EOS>
She
laughed
,
and
held
me
down
;
for
I
made
a
motion
to
leave
my
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
nothing
,
"
cried
she
:
"
I
was
only
going
to
say
that
heaven
did
not
seem
to
be
my
home
;
and
I
broke
my
heart
with
weeping
to
come
back
to
earth
;
and
the
angels
were
so
angry
that
they
flung
me
out
into
the
middle
of
the
heath
on
the
top
of
Wuthering
Heights
;
where
I
woke
sobbing
for
joy
.
<EOS>
That
will
do
to
explain
my
secret
,
as
well
as
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
've
no
more
business
to
marry
Edgar
Linton
than
I
have
to
be
in
heaven
;
and
if
the
wicked
man
in
there
had
not
brought
Heathcliff
so
low
,
I
should
n't
have
thought
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
would
degrade
me
to
marry
Heathcliff
now
;
so
he
shall
never
know
how
I
love
him
:
and
that
,
not
because
he
's
handsome
,
Nelly
,
but
because
he
's
more
myself
than
I
am
.
<EOS>
Whatever
our
souls
are
made
of
,
his
and
mine
are
the
same
;
and
Linton
's
is
as
different
as
a
moonbeam
from
lightning
,
or
frost
from
fire
.
"
  
<EOS>
Ere
this
speech
ended
I
became
sensible
of
Heathcliff
's
presence
.
<EOS>
Having
noticed
a
slight
movement
,
I
turned
my
head
,
and
saw
him
rise
from
the
bench
,
and
steal
out
noiselessly
.
<EOS>
He
had
listened
till
he
heard
Catherine
say
it
would
degrade
her
to
marry
him
,
and
then
he
stayed
to
hear
no
further
.
<EOS>
My
companion
,
sitting
on
the
ground
,
was
prevented
by
the
back
of
the
settle
from
remarking
his
presence
or
departure
;
but
I
started
,
and
bade
her
hush
!
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
gazing
nervously
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
Joseph
is
here
,
"
I
answered
,
catching
opportunely
the
roll
of
his
cartwheels
up
the
road
;
"
and
Heathcliff
will
come
in
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
sure
whether
he
were
not
at
the
door
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
could
n't
overhear
me
at
the
door
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Give
me
Hareton
,
while
you
get
the
supper
,
and
when
it
is
ready
ask
me
to
sup
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
cheat
my
uncomfortable
conscience
,
and
be
convinced
that
Heathcliff
has
no
notion
of
these
things
.
<EOS>
He
has
not
,
has
he
?
<EOS>
He
does
not
know
what
being
in
love
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
no
reason
that
he
should
not
know
,
as
well
as
you
,
"
I
returned
;
"
and
if
you
are
his
choice
,
he
'll
be
the
most
unfortunate
creature
that
ever
was
born
!
<EOS>
As
soon
as
you
become
Mrs.
Linton
,
he
loses
friend
,
and
love
,
and
all
!
<EOS>
Have
you
considered
how
you
'll
bear
the
separation
,
and
how
he
'll
bear
to
be
quite
deserted
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
Because
,
Miss
Catherine
 
"
  
"
He
quite
deserted
!
<EOS>
we
separated
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
with
an
accent
of
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
to
separate
us
,
pray
?
<EOS>
They
'll
meet
the
fate
of
Milo
!
<EOS>
Not
as
long
as
I
live
,
Ellen
:
for
no
mortal
creature
.
<EOS>
Every
Linton
on
the
face
of
the
earth
might
melt
into
nothing
before
I
could
consent
to
forsake
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
's
not
what
I
intend
 
<EOS>
that
's
not
what
I
mean
!
<EOS>
I
should
n't
be
Mrs.
Linton
<EOS>
were
such
a
price
demanded
!
<EOS>
He
'll
be
as
much
to
me
as
he
has
been
all
his
lifetime
.
<EOS>
Edgar
must
shake
off
his
antipathy
,
and
tolerate
him
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
He
will
,
when
he
learns
my
true
feelings
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Nelly
,
I
see
now
you
think
me
a
selfish
wretch
;
but
did
it
never
strike
you
that
if
Heathcliff
and
I
married
,
we
should
be
beggars
?
<EOS>
whereas
,
if
I
marry
Linton
I
can
aid
Heathcliff
to
rise
,
and
place
him
out
of
my
brother
's
power
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
your
husband
's
money
,
Miss
Catherine
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
find
him
not
so
pliable
as
you
calculate
upon
:
and
,
though
I
'm
hardly
a
judge
,
I
think
that
's
the
worst
motive
you
've
given
yet
for
being
the
wife
of
young
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
,
"
retorted
she
;
"
it
is
the
best
!
<EOS>
The
others
were
the
satisfaction
of
my
whims
:
and
for
Edgar
's
sake
,
too
,
to
satisfy
him
.
<EOS>
This
is
for
the
sake
of
one
who
comprehends
in
his
person
my
feelings
to
Edgar
and
myself
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
express
it
;
but
surely
you
and
everybody
have
a
notion
that
there
is
or
should
be
an
existence
of
yours
beyond
you
.
<EOS>
What
were
the
use
of
my
creation
,
if
I
were
entirely
contained
here
?
<EOS>
My
great
miseries
in
this
world
have
been
Heathcliff
's
miseries
,
and
I
watched
and
felt
each
from
the
beginning
:
my
great
thought
in
living
is
himself
.
<EOS>
If
all
else
perished
,
and
_
<EOS>
he
_
remained
,
<EOS>
_
I
_
should
still
continue
to
be
;
and
if
all
else
remained
,
and
he
were
annihilated
,
the
universe
would
turn
to
a
mighty
stranger
:
<EOS>
I
should
not
seem
a
part
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
love
for
Linton
is
like
the
foliage
in
the
woods
<EOS>
:
time
will
change
it
,
I
'm
well
aware
,
as
winter
changes
the
trees
.
<EOS>
My
love
for
Heathcliff
resembles
the
eternal
rocks
beneath
:
a
source
of
little
visible
delight
,
but
necessary
.
<EOS>
Nelly
,
I
_
am
_
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
He
's
always
,
always
in
my
mind
:
not
as
a
pleasure
,
any
more
than
I
am
always
a
pleasure
to
myself
,
but
as
my
own
being
.
<EOS>
So
do
n't
talk
of
our
separation
again
:
it
is
impracticable
;
and
 
"
  
She
paused
,
and
hid
her
face
in
the
folds
of
my
gown
;
but
I
jerked
it
forcibly
away
.
<EOS>
I
was
out
of
patience
with
her
folly
!
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
can
make
any
sense
of
your
nonsense
,
Miss
,
"
I
said
,
"
it
only
goes
to
convince
me
that
you
are
ignorant
of
the
duties
you
undertake
in
marrying
;
or
else
that
you
are
a
wicked
,
unprincipled
girl
.
<EOS>
But
trouble
me
with
no
more
secrets
:
<EOS>
I
'll
not
promise
to
keep
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
keep
that
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
'll
not
promise
,
"
I
repeated
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
about
to
insist
,
when
the
entrance
of
Joseph
finished
our
conversation
;
and
Catherine
removed
her
seat
to
a
corner
,
and
nursed
Hareton
,
while
I
made
the
supper
.
<EOS>
After
it
was
cooked
,
my
fellow
-
servant
and
I
began
to
quarrel
who
should
carry
some
to
Mr.
Hindley
;
and
we
did
n't
settle
it
till
all
was
nearly
cold
.
<EOS>
Then
we
came
to
the
agreement
that
we
would
let
him
ask
,
if
he
wanted
any
;
for
we
feared
particularly
to
go
into
his
presence
when
he
had
been
some
time
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
is
n't
that
nowt
comed
in
fro
'
th
'
 
field
,
be
this
time
?
<EOS>
What
is
he
about
?
<EOS>
girt
idle
seeght
!
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
old
man
,
looking
round
for
Heathcliff
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
call
him
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
in
the
barn
,
I
've
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
went
and
called
,
but
got
no
answer
.
<EOS>
On
returning
,
I
whispered
to
Catherine
that
he
had
heard
a
good
part
of
what
she
said
,
I
was
sure
;
and
told
how
I
saw
him
quit
the
kitchen
just
as
she
complained
of
her
brother
's
conduct
regarding
him
.
<EOS>
She
jumped
up
in
a
fine
fright
,
flung
Hareton
on
to
the
settle
,
and
ran
to
seek
for
her
friend
herself
;
not
taking
leisure
to
consider
why
she
was
so
flurried
,
or
how
her
talk
would
have
affected
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
absent
such
a
while
that
Joseph
proposed
we
should
wait
no
longer
.
<EOS>
He
cunningly
conjectured
they
were
staying
away
in
order
to
avoid
hearing
his
protracted
blessing
.
<EOS>
They
were
"
ill
eneugh
for
ony
fahl
manners
,
"
he
affirmed
.
<EOS>
And
on
their
behalf
he
added
that
night
a
special
prayer
to
the
usual
quarter
-
of
-
an
-
hour
's
supplication
before
meat
,
and
would
have
tacked
another
to
the
end
of
the
grace
,
had
not
his
young
mistress
broken
in
upon
him
with
a
hurried
command
that
he
must
run
down
the
road
,
and
,
wherever
Heathcliff
had
rambled
,
find
and
make
him
re
-
enter
directly
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
him
,
and
I
_
must
_
,
before
I
go
upstairs
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
the
gate
is
open
:
he
is
somewhere
out
of
hearing
;
for
he
would
not
reply
,
though
I
shouted
at
the
top
of
the
fold
as
loud
as
I
could
.
"
  
<EOS>
Joseph
objected
at
first
;
she
was
too
much
in
earnest
,
however
,
to
suffer
contradiction
;
and
at
last
he
placed
his
hat
on
his
head
,
and
walked
grumbling
forth
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
Catherine
paced
up
and
down
the
floor
,
exclaiming
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
where
he
is
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
where
he
can
be
!
<EOS>
What
did
I
say
,
Nelly
?
<EOS>
I
've
forgotten
.
<EOS>
Was
he
vexed
at
my
bad
humour
this
afternoon
?
<EOS>
Dear
!
<EOS>
tell
me
what
I
've
said
to
grieve
him
?
<EOS>
I
do
wish
he
'd
come
.
<EOS>
I
do
wish
he
would
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
noise
for
nothing
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
cried
,
though
rather
uneasy
myself
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
trifle
scares
you
!
<EOS>
It
's
surely
no
great
cause
of
alarm
that
Heathcliff
should
take
a
moonlight
saunter
on
the
moors
,
or
even
lie
too
sulky
to
speak
to
us
in
the
hay
-
loft
.
<EOS>
I
'll
engage
he
's
lurking
there
.
<EOS>
See
if
I
do
n't
ferret
him
out
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
departed
to
renew
my
search
;
its
result
was
disappointment
,
and
Joseph
's
quest
ended
in
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yon
lad
gets
war

"
<EOS>
observed
he
on
re
-
entering
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He

"

interrupted
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
Have

<EOS>

"
  
<EOS>
It
_
was
_
a
very
dark
evening
for
summer
:
the
clouds
appeared
inclined
to
thunder
,
and
I
said
we
had
better
all
sit
down
;
the
approaching
rain
would
be
certain
to
bring
him
home
without
further
trouble
.
<EOS>
However
,
Catherine
would
not
be
persuaded
into
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
She
kept
wandering
to
and
fro
,
from
the
gate
to
the
door
,
in
a
state
of
agitation
which
permitted
no
repose
;
and
at
length
took
up
a
permanent
situation
on
one
side
of
the
wall
,
near
the
road
:
where
,
heedless
of
my
expostulations
and
the
growling
thunder
,
and
the
great
drops
that
began
to
plash
around
her
,
she
remained
,
calling
at
intervals
,
and
then
listening
,
and
then
crying
outright
.
<EOS>
She
beat
Hareton
,
or
any
child
,
at
a
good
passionate
fit
of
crying
.
  
<EOS>
About
midnight
,
while
we
still
sat
up
,
the
storm
came
rattling
over
the
Heights
in
full
fury
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
violent
wind
,
as
well
as
thunder
,
and
either
one
or
the
other
split
a
tree
off
at
the
corner
of
the
building
:
a
huge
bough
fell
across
the
roof
,
and
knocked
down
a
portion
of
the
east
chimney
-
stack
,
sending
a
clatter
of
stones
and
soot
into
the
kitchen
-
fire
.
<EOS>
We
thought
a
bolt
had
fallen
in
the
middle
of
us
;
and
Joseph
swung
on
to
his
knees
,
beseeching
the
Lord
to
remember
the
patriarchs
Noah
and
Lot
,
and
,
as
in
former
times
,
spare
the
righteous
,
though
he
smote
the
ungodly
.
<EOS>
I
felt
some
sentiment
that
it
must
be
a
judgment
on
us
also
.
<EOS>
The
Jonah
,
in
my
mind
,
was
Mr.
Earnshaw
;
and
I
shook
the
handle
of
his
den
that
I
might
ascertain
if
he
were
yet
living
.
<EOS>
He
replied
audibly
enough
,
in
a
fashion
which
made
my
companion
vociferate
,
more
clamorously
than
before
,
that
a
wide
distinction
might
be
drawn
between
saints
like
himself
and
sinners
like
his
master
.
<EOS>
But
the
uproar
passed
away
in
twenty
minutes
,
leaving
us
all
unharmed
;
excepting
Cathy
,
who
got
thoroughly
drenched
for
her
obstinacy
in
refusing
to
take
shelter
,
and
standing
bonnetless
and
shawl
-
less
to
catch
as
much
water
as
she
could
with
her
hair
and
clothes
.
<EOS>
She
came
in
and
lay
down
on
the
settle
,
all
soaked
as
she
was
,
turning
her
face
to
the
back
,
and
putting
her
hands
before
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Miss
!
"
I
exclaimed
,
touching
her
shoulder
;
"
you
are
not
bent
on
getting
your
death
,
are
you
?
<EOS>
Do
you
know
what
o'clock
it
is
?
<EOS>
Half
-
past
twelve
.
<EOS>
Come
,
come
to
bed
!
<EOS>
there
's
no
use
waiting
any
longer
on
that
foolish
boy
:
<EOS>
he
'll
be
gone
to
Gimmerton
,
and
he
'll
stay
there
now
.
<EOS>
He
guesses
<EOS>
we
should
n't
wait
for
him
till
this
late
hour
:
at
least
,
he
guesses
that
only
Mr.
Hindley
would
be
up
;
and
he
'd
rather
avoid
having
the
door
opened
by
the
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
nay
,
he
's
noan
at
Gimmerton
,
"
said
Joseph
.
<EOS>
"
I
's
niver
wonder
<EOS>
but
he
's
at
t
'
bothom
of
a
bog
-
hoile
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
Yah

<EOS>
t

Scripture
ses

<EOS>
"
And
he
began
quoting
several
texts
,
referring
us
to
chapters
and
verses
where
we
might
find
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
,
having
vainly
begged
the
wilful
girl
to
rise
and
remove
her
wet
things
,
left
him
preaching
and
her
shivering
,
and
betook
myself
to
bed
with
little
Hareton
,
who
slept
as
fast
as
if
everyone
had
been
sleeping
round
him
.
<EOS>
I
heard
Joseph
read
on
a
while
afterwards
;
then
I
distinguished
his
slow
step
on
the
ladder
,
and
then
I
dropped
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
Coming
down
somewhat
later
than
usual
,
I
saw
,
by
the
sunbeams
piercing
the
chinks
of
the
shutters
,
Miss
Catherine
still
seated
near
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
The
house
-
door
was
ajar
,
too
;
light
entered
from
its
unclosed
windows
;
Hindley
had
come
out
,
and
stood
on
the
kitchen
hearth
,
haggard
and
drowsy
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
ails
you
,
Cathy
?
"
<EOS>
he
was
saying
when
I
entered
:
"
you
look
as
dismal
as
a
drowned
whelp
.
<EOS>
Why
are
you
so
damp
and
pale
,
child
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
wet
,
"
she
answered
reluctantly
,
"
and
I
'm
cold
,
that
's
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
she
is
naughty
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
,
perceiving
the
master
to
be
tolerably
sober
.
<EOS>
"
She
got
steeped
in
the
shower
of
yesterday
evening
,
and
there
she
has
sat
the
night
through
,
and
I
could
n't
prevail
on
her
to
stir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Earnshaw
stared
at
us
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
The
night
through
,
"
he
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
What
kept
her
up
?
<EOS>
not
fear
of
the
thunder
,
surely
?
<EOS>
That
was
over
hours
since
.
"
  
<EOS>
Neither
of
us
wished
to
mention
Heathcliff
's
absence
,
as
long
as
we
could
conceal
it
;
so
I
replied
,
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
how
she
took
it
into
her
head
to
sit
up
;
and
she
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
morning
was
fresh
and
cool
;
I
threw
back
the
lattice
,
and
presently
the
room
filled
with
sweet
scents
from
the
garden
;
but
Catherine
called
peevishly
to
me
,
"
Ellen
,
shut
the
window
.
<EOS>
I
'm
starving
!
"
<EOS>
And
her
teeth
chattered
as
she
shrank
closer
to
the
almost
extinguished
embers
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
ill
,
"
said
Hindley
,
taking
her
wrist
;
"
I
suppose
that
's
the
reason
she
would
not
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Damn
it
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
be
troubled
with
more
sickness
here
.
<EOS>
What
took
you
into
the
rain
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Running
after
t
'
lads
,
as
usuald
!
"
croaked
Joseph
,
catching
an
opportunity
from
our
hesitation
to
thrust
in
his
evil
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
war

I

Never

of

Heathcliff

but

directing
his
discourse
to
me
)

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Silence
,
eavesdropper
!
"
cried
Catherine
;
"
none
of
your
insolence
before
me
!
<EOS>
Edgar
Linton
came
yesterday
by
chance
,
Hindley
;
and
it
was
_
<EOS>
I
_
who
told
him
to
be
off
:
because
I
knew
you
would
not
like
to
have
met
him
as
you
were
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
lie
,
Cathy
,
no
doubt
,
"
answered
her
brother
,
"
and
you
are
a
confounded
simpleton
!
<EOS>
But
never
mind
Linton
at
present
:
tell
me
,
were
you
not
with
Heathcliff
last
night
?
<EOS>
Speak
the
truth
,
now
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
be
afraid
of
harming
him
:
though
I
hate
him
as
much
as
ever
,
he
did
me
a
good
turn
a
short
time
since
that
will
make
my
conscience
tender
of
breaking
his
neck
.
<EOS>
To
prevent
it
,
I
shall
send
him
about
his
business
this
very
morning
;
and
after
he
's
gone
,
I
'd
advise
you
all
to
look
sharp
<EOS>
:
I
shall
only
have
the
more
humour
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
Heathcliff
last
night
,
"
answered
Catherine
,
beginning
to
sob
bitterly
:
"
and
if
you
do
turn
him
out
of
doors
,
I
'll
go
with
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
perhaps
,
you
'll
never
have
an
opportunity
:
perhaps
,
he
's
gone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
she
burst
into
uncontrollable
grief
,
and
the
remainder
of
her
words
were
inarticulate
.
  
<EOS>
Hindley
lavished
on
her
a
torrent
of
scornful
abuse
,
and
bade
her
get
to
her
room
immediately
,
or
she
should
n't
cry
for
nothing
!
<EOS>
I
obliged
her
to
obey
;
and
I
shall
never
forget
what
a
scene
she
acted
when
we
reached
her
chamber
:
it
terrified
me
.
<EOS>
I
thought
she
was
going
mad
,
and
I
begged
Joseph
to
run
for
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
It
proved
the
commencement
of
delirium
:
Mr.
Kenneth
,
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
,
pronounced
her
dangerously
ill
;
she
had
a
fever
.
<EOS>
He
bled
her
,
and
he
told
me
to
let
her
live
on
whey
and
water
-
gruel
,
and
take
care
<EOS>
she
did
not
throw
herself
downstairs
or
out
of
the
window
;
and
then
he
left
:
for
he
had
enough
to
do
in
the
parish
,
where
two
or
three
miles
was
the
ordinary
distance
between
cottage
and
cottage
.
  
<EOS>
Though
I
can
not
say
I
made
a
gentle
nurse
,
and
Joseph
and
the
master
were
no
better
,
and
though
our
patient
was
as
wearisome
and
headstrong
as
a
patient
could
be
,
she
weathered
it
through
.
<EOS>
Old
Mrs.
Linton
paid
us
several
visits
,
to
be
sure
,
and
set
things
to
rights
,
and
scolded
and
ordered
us
all
;
and
when
Catherine
was
convalescent
,
she
insisted
on
conveying
her
to
Thrushcross
Grange
:
for
which
deliverance
we
were
very
grateful
.
<EOS>
But
the
poor
dame
had
reason
to
repent
of
her
kindness
:
she
and
her
husband
both
took
the
fever
,
and
died
within
a
few
days
of
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
Our
young
lady
returned
to
us
saucier
and
more
passionate
,
and
haughtier
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
had
never
been
heard
of
since
the
evening
of
the
thunder
-
storm
;
and
,
one
day
,
I
had
the
misfortune
,
when
she
had
provoked
me
exceedingly
,
to
lay
the
blame
of
his
disappearance
on
her
:
<EOS>
where
indeed
it
belonged
,
as
she
well
knew
.
<EOS>
From
that
period
,
for
several
months
,
she
ceased
to
hold
any
communication
with
me
,
save
in
the
relation
of
a
mere
servant
.
<EOS>
Joseph
fell
under
a
ban
also
:
he
would
speak
his
mind
,
and
lecture
her
all
the
same
as
if
she
were
a
little
girl
;
and
she
esteemed
herself
a
woman
,
and
our
mistress
,
and
thought
that
her
recent
illness
gave
her
a
claim
to
be
treated
with
consideration
.
<EOS>
Then
the
doctor
had
said
that
she
would
not
bear
crossing
much
;
she
ought
to
have
her
own
way
;
and
it
was
nothing
less
than
murder
in
her
eyes
for
any
one
to
presume
to
stand
up
and
contradict
her
.
<EOS>
From
Mr.
Earnshaw
and
his
companions
she
kept
aloof
;
and
tutored
by
Kenneth
,
and
serious
threats
of
a
fit
that
often
attended
her
rages
,
her
brother
allowed
her
whatever
she
pleased
to
demand
,
and
generally
avoided
aggravating
her
fiery
temper
.
<EOS>
He
was
rather
too
indulgent
in
humouring
her
caprices
;
not
from
affection
,
but
from
pride
:
he
wished
earnestly
to
see
her
bring
honour
to
the
family
by
an
alliance
with
the
Lintons
,
and
as
long
as
she
let
him
alone
<EOS>
she
might
trample
on
us
like
slaves
,
for
aught
he
cared
!
<EOS>
Edgar
Linton
,
as
multitudes
have
been
before
and
will
be
after
him
,
was
infatuated
:
and
believed
himself
the
happiest
man
alive
on
the
day
he
led
her
to
Gimmerton
Chapel
,
three
years
subsequent
to
his
father
's
death
.
  
<EOS>
Much
against
my
inclination
,
I
was
persuaded
to
leave
Wuthering
Heights
and
accompany
her
here
.
<EOS>
Little
Hareton
was
nearly
five
years
old
,
and
I
had
just
begun
to
teach
him
his
letters
.
<EOS>
We
made
a
sad
parting
;
but
Catherine
's
tears
were
more
powerful
than
ours
.
<EOS>
When
I
refused
to
go
,
and
when
she
found
her
entreaties
did
not
move
me
,
she
went
lamenting
to
her
husband
and
brother
.
<EOS>
The
former
offered
me
munificent
wages
;
the
latter
ordered
me
to
pack
up
:
he
wanted
no
women
in
the
house
,
he
said
,
now
that
there
was
no
mistress
;
and
as
to
Hareton
,
the
curate
should
take
him
in
hand
,
by
-
and
-
by
.
<EOS>
And
so
I
had
<EOS>
but
one
choice
left
:
to
do
as
I
was
ordered
.
<EOS>
I
told
the
master
he
got
rid
of
all
decent
people
only
to
run
to
ruin
a
little
faster
;
I
kissed
Hareton
,
said
good
-
by
;
and
since
then
he
has
been
a
stranger
:
and
it
's
very
queer
to
think
it
,
but
<EOS>
I
've
no
doubt
he
has
completely
forgotten
all
about
Ellen
Dean
,
and
that
he
was
ever
more
than
all
the
world
to
her
<EOS>
and
she
to
him
!
     
<EOS>
At
this
point
of
the
housekeeper
's
story
she
chanced
to
glance
towards
the
time
-
piece
over
the
chimney
;
and
was
in
amazement
on
seeing
the
minute
-
hand
measure
half
-
past
one
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
hear
of
staying
a
second
longer
:
in
truth
,
I
felt
rather
disposed
to
defer
the
sequel
of
her
narrative
myself
.
<EOS>
And
now
that
she
is
vanished
to
her
rest
,
and
I
have
meditated
for
another
hour
or
two
,
I
shall
summon
courage
to
go
also
,
in
spite
of
aching
laziness
of
head
and
limbs
.
    
<EOS>
A
charming
introduction
to
a
hermit
's
life
!
<EOS>
Four
weeks
'
torture
,
tossing
,
and
sickness
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
these
bleak
winds
and
bitter
northern
skies
,
and
impassable
roads
,
and
dilatory
country
surgeons
!
<EOS>
And
oh
,
this
dearth
of
the
human
physiognomy
!
<EOS>
and
,
worse
than
all
,
the
terrible
intimation
of
Kenneth
that
I
need
not
expect
to
be
out
of
doors
till
spring
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
has
just
honoured
me
with
a
call
.
<EOS>
About
seven
days
ago
he
sent
me
a
brace
of
grouse
 
the
last
of
the
season
.
<EOS>
Scoundrel
!
<EOS>
He
is
not
altogether
guiltless
in
this
illness
of
mine
;
and
that
I
had
a
great
mind
to
tell
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
how
could
I
offend
a
man
who
was
charitable
enough
to
sit
at
my
bedside
a
good
hour
,
and
talk
on
some
other
subject
than
pills
and
draughts
,
blisters
and
leeches
?
<EOS>
This
is
quite
an
easy
interval
.
<EOS>
I
am
too
weak
to
read
;
yet
I
feel
as
if
I
could
enjoy
something
interesting
.
<EOS>
Why
not
have
up
Mrs.
Dean
to
finish
her
tale
?
<EOS>
I
can
recollect
its
chief
incidents
,
as
far
as
she
had
gone
.
<EOS>
Yes
:
I
remember
her
hero
had
run
off
,
and
never
been
heard
of
for
three
years
;
and
the
heroine
was
married
.
<EOS>
I
'll
ring
:
she
'll
be
delighted
to
find
me
capable
of
talking
cheerfully
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dean
came
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
wants
twenty
minutes
,
sir
,
to
taking
the
medicine
,
"
she
commenced
.
  
<EOS>
"
Away
,
away
with
it
!
"
I
replied
;
"
I
desire
to
have
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
The
doctor
says
you
must
drop
the
powders
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
With
all
my
heart
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
interrupt
me
.
<EOS>
Come
and
take
your
seat
here
.
<EOS>
Keep
your
fingers
from
that
bitter
phalanx
of
vials
.
<EOS>
Draw
your
knitting
out
of
your
pocket
 
that
will
do
 
now
continue
the
history
of
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
from
where
you
left
off
,
to
the
present
day
.
<EOS>
Did
he
finish
his
education
on
the
Continent
,
and
come
back
a
gentleman
?
<EOS>
or
did
he
get
a
sizar
's
place
at
college
,
or
escape
to
America
,
and
earn
honours
by
drawing
blood
from
his
foster
-
country
?
<EOS>
or
make
a
fortune
more
promptly
on
the
English
highways
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
have
done
a
little
in
all
these
vocations
,
Mr.
Lockwood
;
but
I
could
n't
give
my
word
for
any
.
<EOS>
I
stated
before
that
I
did
n't
know
how
he
gained
his
money
;
neither
am
I
aware
of
the
means
he
took
to
raise
his
mind
from
the
savage
ignorance
into
which
it
was
sunk
:
but
,
with
your
leave
,
I
'll
proceed
in
my
own
fashion
,
if
you
think
it
will
amuse
and
not
weary
you
.
<EOS>
Are
you
feeling
better
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
good
news
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
I
got
Miss
Catherine
and
myself
to
Thrushcross
Grange
;
and
,
to
my
agreeable
disappointment
,
she
behaved
infinitely
better
than
I
dared
to
expect
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
almost
over
-
fond
of
Mr.
Linton
;
and
even
to
his
sister
she
showed
plenty
of
affection
.
<EOS>
They
were
both
very
attentive
to
her
comfort
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
thorn
bending
to
the
honeysuckles
,
but
the
honeysuckles
embracing
the
thorn
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
mutual
concessions
:
one
stood
erect
,
and
the
others
yielded
:
and
who
can
be
ill
-
natured
and
bad
-
tempered
when
they
encounter
neither
opposition
nor
indifference
?
<EOS>
I
observed
that
Mr.
Edgar
had
a
deep
-
rooted
fear
of
ruffling
her
humour
.
<EOS>
He
concealed
it
from
her
;
but
if
ever
he
heard
me
answer
sharply
,
or
saw
any
other
servant
grow
cloudy
at
some
imperious
order
of
hers
,
he
would
show
his
trouble
by
a
frown
of
displeasure
that
never
darkened
on
his
own
account
.
<EOS>
He
many
a
time
spoke
sternly
to
me
about
my
pertness
;
and
averred
that
the
stab
of
a
knife
could
not
inflict
a
worse
pang
than
he
suffered
at
seeing
his
lady
vexed
.
<EOS>
Not
to
grieve
a
kind
master
,
I
learned
to
be
less
touchy
;
and
,
for
the
space
of
half
a
year
,
the
gunpowder
lay
as
harmless
as
sand
,
because
no
fire
came
near
to
explode
it
.
<EOS>
Catherine
had
seasons
of
gloom
and
silence
now
and
then
:
they
were
respected
with
sympathising
silence
by
her
husband
,
who
ascribed
them
to
an
alteration
in
her
constitution
,
produced
by
her
perilous
illness
;
as
she
was
never
subject
to
depression
of
spirits
before
.
<EOS>
The
return
of
sunshine
was
welcomed
by
answering
sunshine
from
him
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
may
assert
that
they
were
really
in
possession
of
deep
and
growing
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
It
ended
.
<EOS>
Well
,
we
_
must
_
be
for
ourselves
in
the
long
run
;
the
mild
and
generous
are
only
more
justly
selfish
than
the
domineering
;
and
it
ended
when
circumstances
caused
each
to
feel
that
the
one
's
interest
was
not
the
chief
consideration
in
the
other
's
thoughts
.
<EOS>
On
a
mellow
evening
in
September
,
I
was
coming
from
the
garden
with
a
heavy
basket
of
apples
which
I
had
been
gathering
.
<EOS>
It
had
got
dusk
,
and
the
moon
looked
over
the
high
wall
of
the
court
,
causing
undefined
shadows
to
lurk
in
the
corners
of
the
numerous
projecting
portions
of
the
building
.
<EOS>
I
set
my
burden
on
the
house
-
steps
by
the
kitchen
-
door
,
and
lingered
to
rest
,
and
drew
in
a
few
more
breaths
of
the
soft
,
sweet
air
;
my
eyes
were
on
the
moon
,
and
my
back
to
the
entrance
,
when
I
heard
a
voice
behind
me
say
,
 
"
Nelly
,
is
that
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
deep
voice
,
and
foreign
in
tone
;
yet
there
was
something
in
the
manner
of
pronouncing
my
name
which
made
it
sound
familiar
.
<EOS>
I
turned
about
to
discover
who
spoke
,
fearfully
;
for
the
doors
were
shut
,
and
I
had
seen
nobody
on
approaching
the
steps
.
<EOS>
Something
stirred
in
the
porch
;
and
,
moving
nearer
,
I
distinguished
a
tall
man
dressed
in
dark
clothes
,
with
dark
face
and
hair
.
<EOS>
He
leant
against
the
side
,
and
held
his
fingers
on
the
latch
as
if
intending
to
open
for
himself
.
<EOS>
"
Who
can
it
be
?
<EOS>
"
I
thought
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Earnshaw
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
The
voice
has
no
resemblance
to
his
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
waited
here
an
hour
,
"
he
resumed
,
while
I
continued
staring
;
"
and
the
whole
of
that
time
all
round
has
been
as
still
as
death
.
<EOS>
I
dared
not
enter
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
me
?
<EOS>
Look
,
I
'm
not
a
stranger
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
ray
fell
on
his
features
;
the
cheeks
were
sallow
,
and
half
covered
with
black
whiskers
;
the
brows
lowering
,
the
eyes
deep
-
set
and
singular
.
<EOS>
I
remembered
the
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
,
uncertain
whether
to
regard
him
as
a
worldly
visitor
,
and
I
raised
my
hands
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
you
come
back
?
<EOS>
Is
it
really
you
?
<EOS>
Is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Heathcliff
,
"
he
replied
,
glancing
from
me
up
to
the
windows
,
which
reflected
a
score
of
glittering
moons
,
but
showed
no
lights
from
within
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Are
they
at
home
?
<EOS>
where
is
she
?
<EOS>
Nelly
,
you
are
not
glad
!
<EOS>
you
need
n't
be
so
disturbed
.
<EOS>
Is
she
here
?
<EOS>
Speak
!
<EOS>
I
want
to
have
one
word
with
her
 
your
mistress
.
<EOS>
Go
,
and
say
some
person
from
Gimmerton
desires
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
will
she
take
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
What
will
she
do
?
<EOS>
The
surprise
bewilders
me
 
<EOS>
it
will
put
her
out
of
her
head
!
<EOS>
And
you
_
are
_
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
But
altered
!
<EOS>
Nay
,
there
's
no
comprehending
it
.
<EOS>
Have
you
been
for
a
soldier
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
and
carry
my
message
,
"
he
interrupted
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
in
hell
till
you
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
lifted
the
latch
,
and
I
entered
;
but
when
I
got
to
the
parlour
where
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Linton
were
,
I
could
not
persuade
myself
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
At
length
I
resolved
on
making
an
excuse
to
ask
if
they
would
have
the
candles
lighted
,
and
I
opened
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
They
sat
together
in
a
window
whose
lattice
lay
back
against
the
wall
,
and
displayed
,
beyond
the
garden
trees
,
and
the
wild
green
park
,
the
valley
of
Gimmerton
,
with
a
long
line
of
mist
winding
nearly
to
its
top
(
for
very
soon
after
you
pass
the
chapel
,
as
you
may
have
noticed
,
the
sough
that
runs
from
the
marshes
joins
a
beck
which
follows
the
bend
of
the
glen
)
.
<EOS>
Wuthering
Heights
rose
above
this
silvery
vapour
;
but
our
old
house
was
invisible
;
it
rather
dips
down
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
Both
the
room
and
its
occupants
,
and
the
scene
they
gazed
on
,
looked
wondrously
peaceful
.
<EOS>
I
shrank
reluctantly
from
performing
my
errand
;
and
was
actually
going
away
leaving
it
unsaid
,
after
having
put
my
question
about
the
candles
,
when
a
sense
of
my
folly
compelled
me
to
return
,
and
mutter
,
<EOS>
"
A
person
from
Gimmerton
wishes
to
see
you
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
he
want
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Linton
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
question
him
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
close
the
curtains
,
Nelly
,
"
she
said
;
"
and
bring
up
tea
.
<EOS>
I
'll
be
back
again
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
quitted
the
apartment
;
Mr.
Edgar
inquired
,
carelessly
,
who
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
Some
one
mistress
does
not
expect
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
Heathcliff
 
<EOS>
you
recollect
him
,
sir
 
who
used
to
live
at
Mr.
Earnshaw
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
the
gipsy
 
the
ploughboy
?
<EOS>
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
not
say
so
to
Catherine
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
you
must
not
call
him
by
those
names
,
master
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
She
'd
be
sadly
grieved
to
hear
you
.
<EOS>
She
was
nearly
heartbroken
when
he
ran
off
.
<EOS>
I
guess
his
return
will
make
a
jubilee
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
walked
to
a
window
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
that
overlooked
the
court
.
<EOS>
He
unfastened
it
,
and
leant
out
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
were
below
,
for
he
exclaimed
quickly
:
"
Do
n't
stand
there
,
love
!
<EOS>
Bring
the
person
in
,
if
it
be
anyone
particular
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
I
heard
the
click
of
the
latch
,
and
Catherine
flew
up
-
stairs
,
breathless
and
wild
;
too
excited
to
show
gladness
:
<EOS>
indeed
,
by
her
face
,
you
would
rather
have
surmised
an
awful
calamity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Edgar
,
Edgar
!
"
she
panted
,
flinging
her
arms
round
his
neck
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Edgar
darling
!
<EOS>
Heathcliff
's
come
back
 
<EOS>
he
is
!
"
<EOS>
And
she
tightened
her
embrace
to
a
squeeze
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
cried
her
husband
,
crossly
,
"
do
n't
strangle
me
for
that
!
<EOS>
He
never
struck
me
as
such
a
marvellous
treasure
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
need
to
be
frantic
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
did
n't
like
him
,
"
she
answered
,
repressing
a
little
the
intensity
of
her
delight
.
"
<EOS>
Yet
,
for
my
sake
,
you
must
be
friends
now
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
him
to
come
up
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
"
he
said
,
"
into
the
parlour
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
else
?
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
He
looked
vexed
,
and
suggested
the
kitchen
as
a
more
suitable
place
for
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
eyed
him
with
a
droll
expression
 
half
angry
,
half
laughing
at
his
fastidiousness
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
added
,
after
a
while
;
"
I
can
not
sit
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
Set
two
tables
here
,
Ellen
:
one
for
your
master
and
Miss
Isabella
,
being
gentry
;
the
other
for
Heathcliff
and
myself
,
being
of
the
lower
orders
.
<EOS>
Will
that
please
you
,
dear
?
<EOS>
Or
must
I
have
a
fire
lighted
elsewhere
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
give
directions
.
<EOS>
I
'll
run
down
and
secure
my
guest
.
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
the
joy
is
too
great
to
be
real
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
about
to
dart
off
again
;
but
Edgar
arrested
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
You
_
bid
him
step
up
,
"
he
said
,
addressing
me
;
"
and
,
Catherine
,
try
to
be
glad
,
without
being
absurd
.
<EOS>
The
whole
household
need
not
witness
the
sight
of
your
welcoming
a
runaway
servant
as
a
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
descended
,
and
found
Heathcliff
waiting
under
the
porch
,
evidently
anticipating
an
invitation
to
enter
.
<EOS>
He
followed
my
guidance
without
waste
of
words
,
and
I
ushered
him
into
the
presence
of
the
master
and
mistress
,
whose
flushed
cheeks
betrayed
signs
of
warm
talking
.
<EOS>
But
the
lady
's
glowed
with
another
feeling
when
her
friend
appeared
at
the
door
<EOS>
:
she
sprang
forward
,
took
both
his
hands
,
and
led
him
to
Linton
;
and
then
she
seized
Linton
's
reluctant
fingers
and
crushed
them
into
his
.
<EOS>
Now
,
fully
revealed
by
the
fire
and
candlelight
,
I
was
amazed
,
more
than
ever
,
to
behold
the
transformation
of
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
He
had
grown
a
tall
,
athletic
,
well
-
formed
man
;
beside
whom
my
master
seemed
quite
slender
and
youth
-
like
.
<EOS>
His
upright
carriage
suggested
the
idea
of
his
having
been
in
the
army
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
was
much
older
in
expression
and
decision
of
feature
than
Mr.
Linton
's
;
it
looked
intelligent
,
and
retained
no
marks
of
former
degradation
.
<EOS>
A
half
-
civilised
ferocity
lurked
yet
in
the
depressed
brows
and
eyes
full
of
black
fire
,
but
it
was
subdued
;
and
his
manner
was
even
dignified
:
quite
divested
of
roughness
,
though
stern
for
grace
.
<EOS>
My
master
's
surprise
equalled
or
exceeded
mine
:
he
remained
for
a
minute
at
a
loss
how
to
address
the
ploughboy
,
as
he
had
called
him
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
dropped
his
slight
hand
,
and
stood
looking
at
him
coolly
till
he
chose
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
at
length
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
,
recalling
old
times
,
would
have
me
give
you
a
cordial
reception
;
and
,
of
course
,
I
am
gratified
when
anything
occurs
to
please
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
also
,
"
answered
Heathcliff
,
"
especially
if
it
be
anything
in
which
I
have
a
part
.
<EOS>
I
shall
stay
an
hour
or
two
willingly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
a
seat
opposite
Catherine
,
who
kept
her
gaze
fixed
on
him
<EOS>
as
if
she
feared
he
would
vanish
were
she
to
remove
it
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
raise
his
to
her
often
:
a
quick
glance
now
and
then
sufficed
;
but
it
flashed
back
,
each
time
more
confidently
,
the
undisguised
delight
he
drank
from
hers
.
<EOS>
They
were
too
much
absorbed
in
their
mutual
joy
to
suffer
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
Not
so
Mr.
Edgar
<EOS>
:
he
grew
pale
with
pure
annoyance
:
a
feeling
that
reached
its
climax
when
his
lady
rose
,
and
stepping
across
the
rug
,
seized
Heathcliff
's
hands
again
,
and
laughed
like
one
beside
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
think
it
a
dream
to
-
morrow
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
be
able
to
believe
that
I
have
seen
,
and
touched
,
and
spoken
to
you
once
more
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
cruel
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
you
do
n't
deserve
this
welcome
.
<EOS>
To
be
absent
and
silent
for
three
years
,
and
never
to
think
of
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
little
more
than
you
have
thought
of
me
,
"
he
murmured
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
of
your
marriage
,
Cathy
,
not
long
since
;
and
,
while
waiting
in
the
yard
below
,
I
meditated
this
plan
 
just
to
have
one
glimpse
of
your
face
,
a
stare
of
surprise
,
perhaps
,
and
pretended
pleasure
;
afterwards
settle
my
score
with
Hindley
;
and
then
prevent
the
law
by
doing
execution
on
myself
.
<EOS>
Your
welcome
has
put
these
ideas
out
of
my
mind
;
but
beware
of
meeting
me
with
another
aspect
next
time
!
<EOS>
Nay
,
you
'll
not
drive
me
off
again
.
<EOS>
You
were
really
sorry
for
me
,
were
you
?
<EOS>
Well
,
there
was
cause
.
<EOS>
I
've
fought
through
a
bitter
life
since
I
last
heard
your
voice
;
and
you
must
forgive
me
,
for
I
struggled
only
for
you
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Catherine
,
unless
we
are
to
have
cold
tea
,
please
to
come
to
the
table
,
"
interrupted
Linton
,
striving
to
preserve
his
ordinary
tone
,
and
a
due
measure
of
politeness
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
will
have
a
long
walk
,
wherever
he
may
lodge
to
-
night
;
and
I
'm
thirsty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
took
her
post
before
the
urn
;
and
Miss
Isabella
came
,
summoned
by
the
bell
;
then
,
having
handed
their
chairs
forward
,
I
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
meal
hardly
endured
ten
minutes
.
<EOS>
Catherine
's
cup
was
never
filled
:
she
could
neither
eat
nor
drink
.
<EOS>
Edgar
had
made
a
slop
in
his
saucer
,
and
scarcely
swallowed
a
mouthful
.
<EOS>
Their
guest
did
not
protract
his
stay
that
evening
above
an
hour
longer
.
<EOS>
I
asked
,
as
he
departed
,
if
he
went
to
Gimmerton
?
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
"
he
answered
:
"
Mr.
Earnshaw
invited
me
,
when
I
called
this
morning
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Earnshaw
invited
_
him
_
!
<EOS>
and
_
he
_
called
on
Mr.
Earnshaw
!
<EOS>
I
pondered
this
sentence
painfully
,
after
he
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Is
he
turning
out
a
bit
of
a
hypocrite
,
and
coming
into
the
country
to
work
mischief
under
a
cloak
?
<EOS>
I
mused
:
<EOS>
I
had
a
presentiment
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
he
had
better
have
remained
away
.
  
<EOS>
About
the
middle
of
the
night
,
I
was
wakened
from
my
first
nap
by
Mrs.
Linton
gliding
into
my
chamber
,
taking
a
seat
on
my
bedside
,
and
pulling
me
by
the
hair
to
rouse
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
rest
,
Ellen
,
"
she
said
,
by
way
of
apology
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
want
some
living
creature
to
keep
me
company
in
my
happiness
!
<EOS>
Edgar
is
sulky
,
because
I
'm
glad
of
a
thing
that
does
not
interest
him
:
he
refuses
to
open
his
mouth
,
except
to
utter
pettish
,
silly
speeches
;
and
he
affirmed
I
was
cruel
and
selfish
for
wishing
to
talk
when
he
was
so
sick
and
sleepy
.
<EOS>
He
always
contrives
to
be
sick
at
the
least
cross
!
<EOS>
I
gave
a
few
sentences
of
commendation
to
Heathcliff
,
and
he
,
either
for
a
headache
or
a
pang
of
envy
,
began
to
cry
:
so
I
got
up
and
left
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
use
is
it
praising
Heathcliff
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
As
lads
they
had
an
aversion
to
each
other
,
and
Heathcliff
would
hate
just
as
much
to
hear
him
praised
:
it
's
human
nature
.
<EOS>
Let
Mr.
Linton
alone
about
him
,
unless
you
would
like
an
open
quarrel
between
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
does
it
not
show
great
weakness
?
"
pursued
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
envious
:
I
never
feel
hurt
at
the
brightness
of
Isabella
's
yellow
hair
and
the
whiteness
of
her
skin
,
at
her
dainty
elegance
,
and
the
fondness
all
the
family
exhibit
for
her
.
<EOS>
Even
you
,
Nelly
,
if
we
have
a
dispute
sometimes
,
you
back
Isabella
at
once
;
and
I
yield
like
a
foolish
mother
<EOS>
:
I
call
her
a
darling
,
and
flatter
her
into
a
good
temper
.
<EOS>
It
pleases
her
brother
to
see
us
cordial
,
and
that
pleases
me
.
<EOS>
But
they
are
very
much
alike
:
they
are
spoiled
children
,
and
fancy
the
world
was
made
for
their
accommodation
;
and
though
I
humour
both
,
I
think
a
smart
chastisement
might
improve
them
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
mistaken
,
Mrs.
Linton
,
"
said
I.
<EOS>
"
They
humour
you
:
I
know
what
there
would
be
to
do
if
they
did
not
.
<EOS>
You
can
well
afford
to
indulge
their
passing
whims
as
long
as
their
business
is
to
anticipate
all
your
desires
.
<EOS>
You
may
,
however
,
fall
out
,
at
last
,
over
something
of
equal
consequence
to
both
sides
;
and
then
those
you
term
weak
are
very
capable
of
being
as
obstinate
as
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
we
shall
fight
to
the
death
,
<EOS>
sha'n't
we
,
Nelly
?
<EOS>
"
she
returned
,
laughing
.
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
I
have
such
faith
in
Linton
's
love
,
that
I
believe
I
might
kill
him
,
and
he
would
n't
wish
to
retaliate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
advised
her
to
value
him
the
more
for
his
affection
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
she
answered
,
"
but
he
need
n't
resort
to
whining
for
trifles
.
<EOS>
It
is
childish
and
,
instead
of
melting
into
tears
because
I
said
that
Heathcliff
was
now
worthy
of
anyone
's
regard
,
and
it
would
honour
the
first
gentleman
in
the
country
to
be
his
friend
,
he
ought
to
have
said
it
for
me
,
and
been
delighted
from
sympathy
.
<EOS>
He
must
get
accustomed
to
him
,
and
he
may
as
well
like
him
:
considering
how
Heathcliff
has
reason
to
object
to
him
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
he
behaved
excellently
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
his
going
to
Wuthering
Heights
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
reformed
in
every
respect
,
apparently
:
quite
a
Christian
:
offering
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
to
his
enemies
all
around
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
explained
it
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
as
much
as
you
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
called
to
gather
information
concerning
me
from
you
,
supposing
you
resided
there
still
;
and
Joseph
told
Hindley
,
who
came
out
and
fell
to
questioning
him
of
what
he
had
been
doing
,
and
how
he
had
been
living
;
and
finally
,
desired
him
to
walk
in
.
<EOS>
There
were
some
persons
sitting
at
cards
;
Heathcliff
joined
them
;
my
brother
lost
some
money
to
him
,
and
,
finding
him
plentifully
supplied
,
he
requested
that
he
would
come
again
in
the
evening
:
to
which
he
consented
.
<EOS>
Hindley
is
too
reckless
to
select
his
acquaintance
prudently
:
he
does
n't
trouble
himself
to
reflect
on
the
causes
he
might
have
for
mistrusting
one
whom
he
has
basely
injured
.
<EOS>
But
Heathcliff
affirms
his
principal
reason
for
resuming
a
connection
with
his
ancient
persecutor
is
a
wish
to
install
himself
in
quarters
at
walking
distance
from
the
Grange
,
and
an
attachment
to
the
house
where
we
lived
together
;
and
likewise
a
hope
that
I
shall
have
more
opportunities
of
seeing
him
there
than
I
could
have
if
he
settled
in
Gimmerton
.
<EOS>
He
means
to
offer
liberal
payment
for
permission
to
lodge
at
the
Heights
;
and
doubtless
my
brother
's
covetousness
will
prompt
him
to
accept
the
terms
:
he
was
always
greedy
;
though
what
he
grasps
with
one
hand
he
flings
away
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
nice
place
for
a
young
man
to
fix
his
dwelling
in
!
"
<EOS>
said
I.
<EOS>
"
Have
you
no
fear
of
the
consequences
,
Mrs.
Linton
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
for
my
friend
,
"
she
replied
:
"
his
strong
head
will
keep
him
from
danger
;
a
little
for
Hindley
:
but
he
ca
n't
be
made
morally
worse
than
he
is
;
and
I
stand
between
him
and
bodily
harm
.
<EOS>
The
event
of
this
evening
has
reconciled
me
to
God
and
humanity
!
<EOS>
I
had
risen
in
angry
rebellion
against
Providence
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
've
endured
very
,
very
bitter
misery
,
Nelly
!
<EOS>
If
that
creature
knew
how
bitter
,
he
'd
be
ashamed
to
cloud
its
removal
with
idle
petulance
.
<EOS>
It
was
kindness
for
him
which
induced
me
to
bear
it
alone
:
had
I
expressed
the
agony
I
frequently
felt
,
he
would
have
been
taught
to
long
for
its
alleviation
as
ardently
as
I.
<EOS>
However
,
it
's
over
,
and
I
'll
take
no
revenge
on
his
folly
;
I
can
afford
to
suffer
anything
hereafter
!
<EOS>
Should
the
meanest
thing
alive
slap
me
on
the
cheek
,
I
'd
not
only
turn
the
other
,
but
I
'd
ask
pardon
for
provoking
it
;
and
,
as
a
proof
,
I
'll
go
make
my
peace
with
Edgar
instantly
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
!
<EOS>
I
'm
an
angel
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
this
self
-
complacent
conviction
she
departed
;
and
the
success
of
her
fulfilled
resolution
was
obvious
on
the
morrow
:
Mr.
Linton
had
not
only
abjured
his
peevishness
(
though
his
spirits
seemed
still
subdued
by
Catherine
's
exuberance
of
vivacity
)
,
but
he
ventured
no
objection
to
her
taking
Isabella
with
her
to
Wuthering
Heights
in
the
afternoon
;
and
she
rewarded
him
with
such
a
summer
of
sweetness
and
affection
in
return
as
made
the
house
a
paradise
for
several
days
;
both
master
and
servants
profiting
from
the
perpetual
sunshine
.
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
<EOS>
I
should
say
in
future
 
used
the
liberty
of
visiting
at
Thrushcross
Grange
cautiously
,
at
first
:
<EOS>
he
seemed
estimating
how
far
its
owner
would
bear
his
intrusion
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
also
,
deemed
it
judicious
to
moderate
her
expressions
of
pleasure
in
receiving
him
;
and
he
gradually
established
his
right
to
be
expected
.
<EOS>
He
retained
a
great
deal
of
the
reserve
for
which
his
boyhood
was
remarkable
;
and
that
served
to
repress
all
startling
demonstrations
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
My
master
's
uneasiness
experienced
a
lull
,
and
further
circumstances
diverted
it
into
another
channel
for
a
space
.
  
<EOS>
His
new
source
of
trouble
sprang
from
the
not
anticipated
misfortune
of
Isabella
Linton
evincing
a
sudden
and
irresistible
attraction
towards
the
tolerated
guest
.
<EOS>
She
was
at
that
time
a
charming
young
lady
of
eighteen
;
infantile
in
manners
,
though
possessed
of
keen
wit
,
keen
feelings
,
and
a
keen
temper
,
too
,
if
irritated
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
,
who
loved
her
tenderly
,
was
appalled
at
this
fantastic
preference
.
<EOS>
Leaving
aside
the
degradation
of
an
alliance
with
a
nameless
man
,
and
the
possible
fact
that
his
property
,
in
default
of
heirs
male
,
might
pass
into
such
a
one
's
power
,
he
had
sense
to
comprehend
Heathcliff
's
disposition
:
to
know
that
,
though
his
exterior
was
altered
,
his
mind
was
unchangeable
and
unchanged
.
<EOS>
And
he
dreaded
that
mind
<EOS>
:
it
revolted
him
:
he
shrank
forebodingly
from
the
idea
of
committing
Isabella
to
its
keeping
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
recoiled
still
more
<EOS>
had
he
been
aware
that
her
attachment
rose
unsolicited
,
and
was
bestowed
where
it
awakened
no
reciprocation
of
sentiment
;
for
the
minute
he
discovered
its
existence
he
laid
the
blame
on
Heathcliff
's
deliberate
designing
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
all
remarked
,
during
some
time
,
that
Miss
Linton
fretted
and
pined
over
something
.
<EOS>
She
grew
cross
and
wearisome
;
snapping
at
and
teasing
Catherine
continually
,
at
the
imminent
risk
of
exhausting
her
limited
patience
.
<EOS>
We
excused
her
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
on
the
plea
of
ill
-
health
:
she
was
dwindling
and
fading
before
our
eyes
.
<EOS>
But
one
day
,
when
she
had
been
peculiarly
wayward
,
rejecting
her
breakfast
,
complaining
that
the
servants
did
not
do
what
she
told
them
;
that
the
mistress
would
allow
her
to
be
nothing
in
the
house
,
and
Edgar
neglected
her
;
that
she
had
caught
a
cold
with
the
doors
being
left
open
,
and
we
let
the
parlour
fire
go
out
on
purpose
to
vex
her
,
with
a
hundred
yet
more
frivolous
accusations
,
Mrs.
Linton
peremptorily
insisted
that
she
should
get
to
bed
;
and
,
having
scolded
her
heartily
,
threatened
to
send
for
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
Mention
of
Kenneth
caused
her
to
exclaim
,
instantly
,
that
her
health
was
perfect
,
and
it
was
only
Catherine
's
harshness
which
made
her
unhappy
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
say
I
am
harsh
,
you
naughty
fondling
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
mistress
,
amazed
at
the
unreasonable
assertion
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
surely
losing
your
reason
.
<EOS>
When
have
I
been
harsh
,
tell
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yesterday
,
"
sobbed
Isabella
,
"
and
now
!
"
  
"
Yesterday
!
"
said
her
sister
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
On
what
occasion
?
"
  
"
In
our
walk
along
the
moor
:
you
told
me
to
ramble
where
I
pleased
,
while
you
sauntered
on
with
Mr.
Heathcliff
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
that
's
your
notion
of
harshness
?
"
said
Catherine
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
no
hint
that
your
company
was
superfluous
?
<EOS>
We
did
n't
care
whether
you
kept
with
us
or
not
;
I
merely
thought
Heathcliff
's
talk
would
have
nothing
entertaining
for
your
ears
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
"
wept
the
young
lady
;
"
you
wished
me
away
,
because
you
knew
I
liked
to
be
there
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
sane
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Linton
,
appealing
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
repeat
our
conversation
,
word
for
word
,
Isabella
;
and
you
point
out
any
charm
it
could
have
had
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mind
the
conversation
,
"
she
answered
:
"
I
wanted
to
be
with
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
?
"
said
Catherine
,
perceiving
her
hesitate
to
complete
the
sentence
.
  
<EOS>
"
With
him
:
and
I
wo
n't
be
always
sent
off
!
"
<EOS>
she
continued
,
kindling
up
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
dog
in
the
manger
,
Cathy
,
and
desire
no
one
to
be
loved
but
yourself
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
an
impertinent
little
monkey
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Linton
,
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
'll
not
believe
this
idiotcy
!
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
that
you
can
covet
the
admiration
of
Heathcliff
 
that
you
consider
him
an
agreeable
person
!
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
misunderstood
you
,
Isabella
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
you
have
not
,
"
said
the
infatuated
girl
.
<EOS>
"
I
love
him
more
than
ever
<EOS>
you
loved
Edgar
,
and
he
might
love
me
,
if
you
would
let
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
be
you
for
a
kingdom
,
then
!
"
<EOS>
Catherine
declared
,
emphatically
:
and
she
seemed
to
speak
sincerely
.
"
<EOS>
Nelly
,
help
me
to
convince
her
of
her
madness
.
<EOS>
Tell
her
what
Heathcliff
is
:
an
unreclaimed
creature
,
without
refinement
,
without
cultivation
;
an
arid
wilderness
of
furze
and
whinstone
.
<EOS>
I
'd
as
soon
put
that
little
canary
into
the
park
on
a
winter
's
day
,
as
recommend
you
to
bestow
your
heart
on
him
!
<EOS>
It
is
deplorable
ignorance
of
his
character
,
child
,
and
nothing
else
,
which
makes
that
dream
enter
your
head
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
do
n't
imagine
that
he
conceals
depths
of
benevolence
and
affection
beneath
a
stern
exterior
!
<EOS>
He
's
not
a
rough
diamond
 
<EOS>
a
pearl
-
containing
oyster
of
a
rustic
<EOS>
:
he
's
a
fierce
,
pitiless
,
wolfish
man
.
<EOS>
I
never
say
to
him
,
"
Let
this
or
that
enemy
alone
,
because
it
would
be
ungenerous
or
cruel
to
harm
them
;
"
I
say
,
"
Let
them
alone
,
because
_
I
_
should
hate
them
to
be
wronged
:
"
<EOS>
and
he
'd
crush
you
like
a
sparrow
's
egg
,
Isabella
,
if
he
found
you
a
troublesome
charge
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
could
n't
love
a
Linton
;
and
yet
he
'd
be
quite
capable
of
marrying
your
fortune
and
expectations
:
<EOS>
avarice
is
growing
with
him
a
besetting
sin
.
<EOS>
There
's
my
picture
:
and
I
'm
his
friend
 
so
much
so
,
that
had
he
thought
seriously
to
catch
you
,
I
should
,
perhaps
,
have
held
my
tongue
,
and
let
you
fall
into
his
trap
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Linton
regarded
her
sister
-
in
-
law
with
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
shame
!
<EOS>
for
shame
!
<EOS>
"
she
repeated
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
worse
than
twenty
foes
,
you
poisonous
friend
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
wo
n't
believe
me
,
then
?
"
said
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
You
think
I
speak
from
wicked
selfishness
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
certain
you
do
,
"
retorted
Isabella
;
"
and
I
shudder
at
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
cried
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
Try
for
yourself
,
if
that
be
your
spirit
:
I
have
done
,
and
yield
the
argument
to
your
saucy
insolence
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
And
I
must
suffer
for
her
egotism
!
"
<EOS>
she
sobbed
,
as
Mrs.
Linton
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
All
,
all
is
against
me
:
she
has
blighted
my
single
consolation
.
<EOS>
But
she
uttered
falsehoods
,
did
n't
she
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
is
not
a
fiend
:
he
has
an
honourable
soul
,
and
a
true
one
,
or
how
could
he
remember
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Banish
him
from
your
thoughts
,
Miss
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
bird
of
bad
omen
:
no
mate
for
you
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
spoke
strongly
,
and
yet
I
ca
n't
contradict
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
better
acquainted
with
his
heart
than
I
,
or
any
one
besides
;
and
she
never
would
represent
him
as
worse
than
he
is
.
<EOS>
Honest
people
do
n't
hide
their
deeds
.
<EOS>
How
has
he
been
living
?
<EOS>
how
has
he
got
rich

They

Hindley

on

does
nothing

I

it

<EOS>
Now
,
Miss
Linton
,
Joseph
is
an
old
rascal
,
but
no
liar
;
and
,
if
his
account
of
Heathcliff
's
conduct
be
true
,
you
would
never
think
of
desiring
such
a
husband
,
would
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
leagued
with
the
rest
,
Ellen
!
"
<EOS>
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
listen
to
your
slanders
.
<EOS>
What
malevolence
you
must
have
to
wish
to
convince
me
that
there
is
no
happiness
in
the
world
!
"
  
<EOS>
Whether
she
would
have
got
over
this
fancy
if
left
to
herself
,
or
persevered
in
nursing
it
perpetually
,
I
can
not
say
:
she
had
little
time
to
reflect
.
<EOS>
The
day
after
,
there
was
a
justice
-
meeting
at
the
next
town
;
my
master
was
obliged
to
attend
;
and
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
aware
of
his
absence
,
called
rather
earlier
than
usual
.
<EOS>
Catherine
and
Isabella
were
sitting
in
the
library
,
on
hostile
terms
,
but
silent
:
<EOS>
the
latter
alarmed
at
her
recent
indiscretion
,
and
the
disclosure
she
had
made
of
her
secret
feelings
in
a
transient
fit
of
passion
;
the
former
,
on
mature
consideration
,
really
offended
with
her
companion
;
and
,
if
she
laughed
again
at
her
pertness
,
inclined
to
make
it
no
laughing
matter
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
did
laugh
as
she
saw
Heathcliff
pass
the
window
.
<EOS>
I
was
sweeping
the
hearth
,
and
I
noticed
a
mischievous
smile
on
her
lips
.
<EOS>
Isabella
,
absorbed
in
her
meditations
,
or
a
book
,
remained
till
the
door
opened
;
and
it
was
too
late
to
attempt
an
escape
,
which
she
would
gladly
have
done
<EOS>
had
it
been
practicable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
that
's
right
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
mistress
,
gaily
,
pulling
a
chair
to
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
Here
are
two
people
sadly
in
need
of
a
third
to
thaw
the
ice
between
them
;
and
you
are
the
very
one
we
should
both
of
us
choose
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
,
I
'm
proud
to
show
you
,
at
last
,
somebody
that
dotes
on
you
more
than
myself
.
<EOS>
I
expect
you
to
feel
flattered
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
it
's
not
Nelly
;
do
n't
look
at
her
!
<EOS>
My
poor
little
sister
-
in
-
law
is
breaking
her
heart
by
mere
contemplation
of
your
physical
and
moral
beauty
.
<EOS>
It
lies
in
your
own
power
to
be
Edgar
's
brother
!
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
Isabella
,
you
sha'n't
run
off
,
"
she
continued
,
arresting
,
with
feigned
playfulness
,
the
confounded
girl
,
who
had
risen
indignantly
.
<EOS>
"
We
were
quarrelling
like
cats
about
you
,
Heathcliff
;
and
I
was
fairly
beaten
in
protestations
of
devotion
and
admiration
:
and
,
moreover
,
I
was
informed
that
if
I
would
but
have
the
manners
to
stand
aside
,
my
rival
,
as
she
will
have
herself
to
be
,
would
shoot
a
shaft
into
your
soul
that
would
fix
you
for
ever
,
and
send
my
image
into
eternal
oblivion
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Catherine
!
"
said
Isabella
,
calling
up
her
dignity
,
and
disdaining
to
struggle
from
the
tight
grasp
that
held
her
,
"
I
'd
thank
you
to
adhere
to
the
truth
and
not
slander
me
,
even
in
joke
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
be
kind
enough
to
bid
this
friend
of
yours
release
me
:
she
forgets
that
you
and
I
are
not
intimate
acquaintances
;
and
what
amuses
her
is
painful
to
me
beyond
expression
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
guest
answered
nothing
,
but
took
his
seat
,
and
looked
thoroughly
indifferent
what
sentiments
she
cherished
concerning
him
,
she
turned
and
whispered
an
earnest
appeal
for
liberty
to
her
tormentor
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Linton
in
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
be
named
a
dog
in
the
manger
again
.
<EOS>
You
_
shall
_
stay
:
now
then
!
<EOS>
Heathcliff
,
why
do
n't
you
evince
satisfaction
at
my
pleasant
news
?
<EOS>
Isabella
swears
that
the
love
Edgar
has
for
me
is
nothing
to
that
she
entertains
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
she
made
some
speech
of
the
kind
;
did
she
not
,
Ellen
?
<EOS>
And
she
has
fasted
ever
since
the
day
before
yesterday
's
walk
,
from
sorrow
and
rage
that
I
despatched
her
out
of
your
society
under
the
idea
of
its
being
unacceptable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
belie
her
,
"
said
Heathcliff
,
twisting
his
chair
to
face
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
wishes
to
be
out
of
my
society
now
,
at
any
rate
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
he
stared
hard
at
the
object
of
discourse
,
as
one
might
do
at
a
strange
repulsive
animal
:
a
centipede
from
the
Indies
,
for
instance
,
which
curiosity
leads
one
to
examine
in
spite
of
the
aversion
it
raises
.
<EOS>
The
poor
thing
could
n't
bear
that
;
she
grew
white
and
red
in
rapid
succession
,
and
,
while
tears
beaded
her
lashes
,
bent
the
strength
of
her
small
fingers
to
loosen
the
firm
clutch
of
Catherine
;
and
perceiving
that
as
fast
as
she
raised
one
finger
off
her
arm
another
closed
down
,
and
she
could
not
remove
the
whole
together
,
she
began
to
make
use
of
her
nails
;
and
their
sharpness
presently
ornamented
the
detainer
's
with
crescents
of
red
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
tigress
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mrs.
Linton
,
setting
her
free
,
and
shaking
her
hand
with
pain
.
<EOS>
"
Begone
,
for
God
's
sake
,
and
hide
your
vixen
face
!
<EOS>
How
foolish
to
reveal
those
talons
to
him
.
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
fancy
the
conclusions
he
'll
draw
?
<EOS>
Look
,
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
they
are
instruments
that
will
do
execution
 
you
must
beware
of
your
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
wrench
them
off
her
fingers
,
if
they
ever
menaced
me
,
"
he
answered
,
brutally
,
when
the
door
had
closed
after
her
.
"
<EOS>
But
what
did
you
mean
by
teasing
the
creature
in
that
manner
,
Cathy
?
<EOS>
You
were
not
speaking
the
truth
,
were
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
I
was
,
"
she
returned
.
"
<EOS>
She
has
been
dying
for
your
sake
several
weeks
,
and
raving
about
you
this
morning
,
and
pouring
forth
a
deluge
of
abuse
,
because
I
represented
your
failings
in
a
plain
light
,
for
the
purpose
of
mitigating
her
adoration
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
notice
it
further
:
I
wished
to
punish
her
sauciness
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
I
like
her
too
well
,
my
dear
Heathcliff
,
to
let
you
absolutely
seize
and
devour
her
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
like
her
too
ill
to
attempt
it
,
"
said
he
,
"
except
in
a
very
ghoulish
fashion
.
<EOS>
You
'd
hear
of
odd
things
if
I
lived
alone
with
that
mawkish
,
waxen
face
:
the
most
ordinary
would
be
painting
on
its
white
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
,
and
turning
the
blue
eyes
black
,
every
day
or
two
:
they
detestably
resemble
Linton
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Delectably
!
"
observed
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
dove
's
eyes
 
<EOS>
angel
's
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
her
brother
's
heir
,
is
she
not
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
after
a
brief
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
sorry
to
think
so
,
"
returned
his
companion
.
<EOS>
"
Half
a
dozen
nephews
shall
erase
her
title
,
please
heaven
!
<EOS>
Abstract
your
mind
from
the
subject
at
present
<EOS>
:
you
are
too
prone
to
covet
your
neighbour
's
goods
;
remember
_
this
_
neighbour
's
goods
are
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
they
were
_
mine
_
,
they
would
be
none
the
less
that
,
"
said
Heathcliff
;
"
but
though
Isabella
Linton
may
be
silly
,
she
is
scarcely
mad
;
and
,
in
short
,
we
'll
dismiss
the
matter
,
as
you
advise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
From
their
tongues
they
did
dismiss
it
;
and
Catherine
,
probably
,
from
her
thoughts
.
<EOS>
The
other
,
I
felt
certain
,
recalled
it
often
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
I
saw
him
smile
to
himself
 
grin
<EOS>
rather
 
and
lapse
into
ominous
musing
whenever
Mrs.
Linton
had
occasion
to
be
absent
from
the
apartment
.
  
<EOS>
I
determined
to
watch
his
movements
.
<EOS>
My
heart
invariably
cleaved
to
the
master
's
,
in
preference
to
Catherine
's
side
:
with
reason
I
imagined
,
for
he
was
kind
,
and
trustful
,
and
honourable
;
and
she
 
<EOS>
she
could
not
be
called
_
opposite
_
,
yet
she
seemed
to
allow
herself
such
wide
latitude
,
that
I
had
little
faith
in
her
principles
,
and
still
less
sympathy
for
her
feelings
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
something
to
happen
which
might
have
the
effect
of
freeing
both
Wuthering
Heights
and
the
Grange
of
Mr.
Heathcliff
quietly
;
leaving
us
as
we
had
been
prior
to
his
advent
.
<EOS>
His
visits
were
a
continual
nightmare
to
me
;
and
,
I
suspected
,
to
my
master
also
.
<EOS>
His
abode
at
the
Heights
was
an
oppression
past
explaining
.
<EOS>
I
felt
that
God
had
forsaken
the
stray
sheep
there
to
its
own
wicked
wanderings
,
and
an
evil
beast
prowled
between
it
and
the
fold
,
waiting
his
time
to
spring
and
destroy
.
    
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
while
meditating
on
these
things
in
solitude
,
I
've
got
up
in
a
sudden
terror
,
and
put
on
my
bonnet
to
go
see
how
all
was
at
the
farm
.
<EOS>
I
've
persuaded
my
conscience
that
it
was
a
duty
to
warn
him
how
people
talked
regarding
his
ways
;
and
then
I
've
recollected
his
confirmed
bad
habits
,
and
,
hopeless
of
benefiting
him
,
have
flinched
from
re
-
entering
the
dismal
house
,
doubting
if
I
could
bear
to
be
taken
at
my
word
.
  
<EOS>
One
time
I
passed
the
old
gate
,
going
out
of
my
way
,
on
a
journey
to
Gimmerton
.
<EOS>
It
was
about
the
period
that
my
narrative
has
reached
:
a
bright
frosty
afternoon
;
the
ground
bare
,
and
the
road
hard
and
dry
.
<EOS>
I
came
to
a
stone
where
the
highway
branches
off
on
to
the
moor
at
your
left
hand
;
a
rough
sand
-
pillar
,
with
the
letters
W.
H.
cut
on
its
north
side
,
on
the
east
,
G.
,
and
<EOS>
on
the
south
-
west
,
T.
G.
It
serves
as
a
guide
-
post
to
the
Grange
,
the
Heights
,
and
village
.
<EOS>
The
sun
shone
yellow
on
its
grey
head
,
reminding
me
of
summer
;
and
I
can
not
say
why
,
but
all
at
once
a
gush
of
child
's
sensations
flowed
into
my
heart
.
<EOS>
Hindley
and
I
held
it
a
favourite
spot
twenty
years
before
.
<EOS>
I
gazed
long
at
the
weather
-
worn
block
;
and
,
stooping
down
,
perceived
a
hole
near
the
bottom
still
full
of
snail
-
shells
and
pebbles
,
which
we
were
fond
of
storing
there
with
more
perishable
things
;
and
,
as
fresh
as
reality
,
it
appeared
that
I
beheld
my
early
playmate
seated
on
the
withered
turf
:
his
dark
,
square
head
bent
forward
,
and
his
little
hand
scooping
out
the
earth
with
a
piece
of
slate
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Hindley
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
,
involuntarily
.
<EOS>
I
started
:
my
bodily
eye
was
cheated
into
a
momentary
belief
that
the
child
lifted
its
face
and
stared
straight
into
mine
!
<EOS>
It
vanished
in
a
twinkling
;
but
immediately
I
felt
an
irresistible
yearning
to
be
at
the
Heights
.
<EOS>
Superstition
urged
me
to
comply
with
this
impulse
:
supposing
he
should
be
dead
!
<EOS>
I
thought
 
or
should
die
soon
!
 
<EOS>
supposing
it
were
a
sign
of
death
!
<EOS>
The
nearer
I
got
to
the
house
the
more
agitated
I
grew
;
and
on
catching
sight
of
it
I
trembled
in
every
limb
.
<EOS>
The
apparition
had
outstripped
me
:
it
stood
looking
through
the
gate
.
<EOS>
That
was
my
first
idea
on
observing
an
elf
-
locked
,
brown
-
eyed
boy
setting
his
ruddy
countenance
against
the
bars
.
<EOS>
Further
reflection
suggested
this
must
be
Hareton
,
_
<EOS>
my
_
Hareton
,
not
altered
greatly
since
I
left
him
,
ten
months
since
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
thee
,
darling
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
,
forgetting
instantaneously
my
foolish
fears
.
<EOS>
"
Hareton
,
it
's
Nelly
!
<EOS>
Nelly
,
thy
nurse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
retreated
out
of
arm
's
length
,
and
picked
up
a
large
flint
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
to
see
thy
father
,
Hareton
,
"
I
added
,
guessing
from
the
action
that
Nelly
,
if
she
lived
in
his
memory
at
all
,
was
not
recognised
as
one
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
raised
his
missile
to
hurl
it
;
I
commenced
a
soothing
speech
,
but
could
not
stay
his
hand
:
the
stone
struck
my
bonnet
;
and
then
ensued
,
from
the
stammering
lips
of
the
little
fellow
,
a
string
of
curses
,
which
,
whether
he
comprehended
them
or
not
,
were
delivered
with
practised
emphasis
,
and
distorted
his
baby
features
into
a
shocking
expression
of
malignity
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
certain
this
grieved
more
than
angered
me
.
<EOS>
Fit
to
cry
<EOS>
,
I
took
an
orange
from
my
pocket
,
and
offered
it
to
propitiate
him
.
<EOS>
He
hesitated
,
and
then
snatched
it
from
my
hold
;
as
if
he
fancied
I
only
intended
to
tempt
and
disappoint
him
.
<EOS>
I
showed
another
,
keeping
it
out
of
his
reach
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
has
taught
you
those
fine
words
,
my
bairn
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
curate
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Damn
the
curate
,
and
thee
!
<EOS>
Gie
me
that
,
"
he
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
us
where
you
got
your
lessons
,
and
you
shall
have
it
,
"
said
I.
<EOS>
"
Who
's
your
master
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Devil
daddy
,
"
was
his
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
learn
from
daddy
?
<EOS>
"
I
continued
.
  
<EOS>
He
jumped
at
the
fruit
;
I
raised
it
higher
.
<EOS>
"
What
does
he
teach
you
?
"
<EOS>
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Naught
,
"
said
he
,
"
but
to
keep
out
of
his
gait
.
<EOS>
Daddy
can
not
bide
me
,
because
I
swear
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
and
the
devil
teaches
you
to
swear
at
daddy
?
<EOS>
"
I
observed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
 
nay
,
"
he
drawled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
,
then
?
"
  
"
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
asked
if
he
liked
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
"
<EOS>
he
answered
again
.
  
<EOS>
Desiring
to
have
his
reasons
for
liking
him
,
I
could
only
gather
the
sentences
 
<EOS>
"
I
known't
:
<EOS>
he
pays
dad
back
what
he
gies
to
me
 
<EOS>
he
curses
daddy
for
cursing
me
.
<EOS>
He
says
I
mun
do
as
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
the
curate
does
not
teach
you
to
read
and
write
,
then
?
"
I
pursued
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
was
told
the
curate
should
have
his
 
teeth
dashed
down
his
 
throat
,
<EOS>
if
he
stepped
over
the
threshold
 
Heathcliff
had
promised
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
put
the
orange
in
his
hand
,
and
bade
him
tell
his
father
that
a
woman
called
Nelly
Dean
was
waiting
to
speak
with
him
,
by
the
garden
gate
.
<EOS>
He
went
up
the
walk
,
and
entered
the
house
;
but
,
instead
of
Hindley
,
Heathcliff
appeared
on
the
door
-
stones
;
and
I
turned
directly
and
ran
down
the
road
as
hard
as
ever
I
could
race
,
making
no
halt
till
I
gained
the
guide
-
post
,
and
feeling
as
scared
as
if
I
had
raised
a
goblin
.
<EOS>
This
is
not
much
connected
with
Miss
Isabella
's
affair
:
except
that
it
urged
me
to
resolve
further
on
mounting
vigilant
guard
,
and
doing
my
utmost
to
check
the
spread
of
such
bad
influence
at
the
Grange
:
even
though
I
should
wake
a
domestic
storm
,
by
thwarting
Mrs.
Linton
's
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
time
Heathcliff
came
my
young
lady
chanced
to
be
feeding
some
pigeons
in
the
court
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
spoken
a
word
to
her
sister
-
in
-
law
for
three
days
;
but
she
had
likewise
dropped
her
fretful
complaining
,
and
we
found
it
a
great
comfort
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
had
not
the
habit
of
bestowing
a
single
unnecessary
civility
on
Miss
Linton
,
I
knew
.
<EOS>
Now
,
as
soon
as
he
beheld
her
,
his
first
precaution
was
to
take
a
sweeping
survey
of
the
house
-
front
.
<EOS>
I
was
standing
by
the
kitchen
-
window
,
but
I
drew
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
He
then
stepped
across
the
pavement
to
her
,
and
said
something
:
she
seemed
embarrassed
,
and
desirous
of
getting
away
;
to
prevent
it
,
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm
.
<EOS>
She
averted
her
face
:
he
apparently
put
some
question
which
she
had
no
mind
to
answer
.
<EOS>
There
was
another
rapid
glance
at
the
house
,
and
supposing
himself
unseen
,
the
scoundrel
had
the
impudence
to
embrace
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Judas
!
<EOS>
Traitor
!
<EOS>
"
I
ejaculated
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
hypocrite
,
too
,
are
you
?
<EOS>
A
deliberate
deceiver
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
,
Nelly
?
"
said
Catherine
's
voice
at
my
elbow
:
I
had
been
over
-
intent
on
watching
the
pair
outside
to
mark
her
entrance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
worthless
friend
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
answered
,
warmly
:
"
the
sneaking
rascal
yonder
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
he
has
caught
a
glimpse
of
us
 
<EOS>
he
is
coming
in
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
will
he
have
the
heart
to
find
a
plausible
excuse
for
making
love
to
Miss
,
when
he
told
you
he
hated
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
saw
Isabella
tear
herself
free
,
and
run
into
the
garden
;
and
a
minute
after
,
Heathcliff
opened
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
withhold
giving
some
loose
to
my
indignation
;
but
Catherine
angrily
insisted
on
silence
,
and
threatened
to
order
me
out
of
the
kitchen
,
if
I
dared
to
be
so
presumptuous
as
to
put
in
my
insolent
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
hear
you
,
people
might
think
you
were
the
mistress
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
You
want
setting
down
in
your
right
place
!
<EOS>
Heathcliff
,
what
are
you
about
,
raising
this
stir
?
<EOS>
I
said
you
must
let
Isabella
alone
!
 
<EOS>
I
beg
you
will
,
unless
you
are
tired
of
being
received
here
,
and
wish
Linton
to
draw
the
bolts
against
you
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
forbid
that
he
should
try
!
"
answered
the
black
villain
.
<EOS>
I
detested
him
just
then
.
<EOS>
"
God
keep
him
meek
and
patient
!
<EOS>
Every
day
I
grow
madder
after
sending
him
to
heaven
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
said
Catherine
,
shutting
the
inner
door
!
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
vex
me
.
<EOS>
Why
have
you
disregarded
my
request
?
<EOS>
Did
she
come
across
you
on
purpose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
to
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
growled
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
right
to
kiss
her
,
if
she
chooses
;
and
you
have
no
right
to
object
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
_
your
_
husband
:
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
you
_
need
n't
be
jealous
of
me
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
jealous
of
you
,
"
replied
the
mistress
;
"
I
'm
jealous
for
you
.
<EOS>
Clear
your
face
:
you
sha'n't
scowl
at
me
!
<EOS>
If
you
like
Isabella
,
you
shall
marry
her
.
<EOS>
But
do
you
like
her
?
<EOS>
Tell
the
truth
,
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
There
,
you
wo
n't
answer
.
<EOS>
I
'm
certain
you
do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
would
Mr.
Linton
approve
of
his
sister
marrying
that
man
?
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Linton
should
approve
,
"
returned
my
lady
,
decisively
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
might
spare
himself
the
trouble
,
"
said
Heathcliff
:
"
I
could
do
as
well
without
his
approbation
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
you
,
Catherine
,
I
have
a
mind
to
speak
a
few
words
now
,
while
we
are
at
it
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
be
aware
that
I
<EOS>
_
know
<EOS>
_
you
have
treated
me
infernally
 
infernally
!
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
?
<EOS>
And
if
you
flatter
yourself
that
I
do
n't
perceive
it
,
you
are
a
fool
;
and
if
you
think
I
can
be
consoled
by
sweet
words
,
you
are
an
idiot
:
and
<EOS>
if
you
fancy
I
'll
suffer
unrevenged
,
I
'll
convince
you
of
the
contrary
,
in
a
very
little
while
!
<EOS>
Meantime
,
thank
you
for
telling
me
your
sister
-
in
-
law
's
secret
:
<EOS>
I
swear
I
'll
make
the
most
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
stand
you
aside
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
new
phase
of
his
character
is
this
?
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Linton
,
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
treated
you
infernally
 
<EOS>
and
you
'll
take
your
revenge
!
<EOS>
How
will
you
take
it
,
ungrateful
brute
?
<EOS>
How
have
I
treated
you
infernally
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
seek
no
revenge
on
you
,
"
replied
Heathcliff
,
less
vehemently
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
the
plan
.
<EOS>
The
tyrant
grinds
down
his
slaves
and
they
do
n't
turn
against
him
;
they
crush
those
beneath
them
.
<EOS>
You
are
welcome
to
torture
me
to
death
for
your
amusement
,
only
allow
me
to
amuse
myself
a
little
in
the
same
style
,
and
refrain
from
insult
as
much
as
you
are
able
.
<EOS>
Having
levelled
my
palace
,
do
n't
erect
a
hovel
and
complacently
admire
your
own
charity
in
giving
me
that
for
a
home
.
<EOS>
If
I
imagined
you
really
wished
me
to
marry
Isabel
,
I
'd
cut
my
throat
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
the
evil
is
that
I
am
_
not
_
jealous
,
is
it
?
"
cried
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
wo
n't
repeat
my
offer
of
a
wife
:
it
is
as
bad
as
offering
Satan
a
lost
soul
.
<EOS>
Your
bliss
lies
,
like
his
,
in
inflicting
misery
.
<EOS>
You
prove
it
.
<EOS>
Edgar
is
restored
from
the
ill
-
temper
he
gave
way
to
at
your
coming
;
I
begin
to
be
secure
and
tranquil
;
and
you
,
restless
to
know
us
at
peace
,
appear
resolved
on
exciting
a
quarrel
.
<EOS>
Quarrel
with
Edgar
,
if
you
please
,
Heathcliff
,
and
deceive
his
sister
<EOS>
:
you
'll
hit
on
exactly
the
most
efficient
method
of
revenging
yourself
on
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
conversation
ceased
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
sat
down
by
the
fire
,
flushed
and
gloomy
.
<EOS>
The
spirit
which
served
her
was
growing
intractable
:
she
could
neither
lay
nor
control
it
.
<EOS>
He
stood
on
the
hearth
with
folded
arms
,
brooding
on
his
evil
thoughts
;
and
in
this
position
I
left
them
to
seek
the
master
,
who
was
wondering
what
kept
Catherine
below
so
long
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ellen
,
"
said
he
,
when
I
entered
,
"
have
you
seen
your
mistress
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
she
's
in
the
kitchen
,
sir
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
sadly
put
out
by
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
behaviour
:
and
,
indeed
,
I
do
think
it
's
time
to
arrange
his
visits
on
another
footing
.
<EOS>
There
's
harm
in
being
too
soft
,
and
now
it
's
come
to
this
 
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
related
the
scene
in
the
court
,
and
,
as
near
as
I
dared
,
the
whole
subsequent
dispute
.
<EOS>
I
fancied
it
could
not
be
very
prejudicial
to
Mrs.
Linton
;
unless
she
made
it
so
afterwards
,
by
assuming
the
defensive
for
her
guest
.
<EOS>
Edgar
Linton
had
difficulty
in
hearing
me
to
the
close
.
<EOS>
His
first
words
revealed
that
he
did
not
clear
his
wife
of
blame
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
insufferable
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
disgraceful
that
she
should
own
him
for
a
friend
,
and
force
his
company
on
me
!
<EOS>
Call
me
two
men
out
of
the
hall
,
Ellen
.
<EOS>
Catherine
shall
linger
no
longer
to
argue
with
the
low
ruffian
 
<EOS>
I
have
humoured
her
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
descended
,
and
bidding
the
servants
wait
in
the
passage
,
went
,
followed
by
me
,
to
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
Its
occupants
had
recommenced
their
angry
discussion
:
Mrs.
Linton
,
at
least
,
was
scolding
with
renewed
vigour
;
Heathcliff
had
moved
to
the
window
,
and
hung
his
head
,
somewhat
cowed
by
her
violent
rating
apparently
.
<EOS>
He
saw
the
master
first
,
and
made
a
hasty
motion
that
she
should
be
silent
;
which
she
obeyed
,
abruptly
,
on
discovering
the
reason
of
his
intimation
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
this
?
"
said
Linton
,
addressing
her
;
"
what
notion
of
propriety
must
you
have
to
remain
here
,
after
the
language
which
has
been
held
to
you
by
that
blackguard
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
because
it
is
his
ordinary
talk
you
think
nothing
of
it
:
you
are
habituated
to
his
baseness
,
and
,
perhaps
,
imagine
I
can
get
used
to
it
too
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
been
listening
at
the
door
,
Edgar
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
mistress
,
in
a
tone
particularly
calculated
to
provoke
her
husband
,
implying
both
carelessness
and
contempt
of
his
irritation
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
,
who
had
raised
his
eyes
at
the
former
speech
,
gave
a
sneering
laugh
at
the
latter
;
on
purpose
,
it
seemed
,
to
draw
Mr.
Linton
's
attention
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
succeeded
;
but
Edgar
did
not
mean
to
entertain
him
with
any
high
flights
of
passion
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
so
far
forbearing
with
you
,
sir
,
"
he
said
quietly
;
"
not
that
I
was
ignorant
of
your
miserable
,
degraded
character
,
but
I
felt
you
were
only
partly
responsible
for
that
;
and
Catherine
wishing
to
keep
up
your
acquaintance
,
I
acquiesced
 
foolishly
.
<EOS>
Your
presence
is
a
moral
poison
that
would
contaminate
the
most
virtuous
:
for
that
cause
,
and
to
prevent
worse
consequences
,
I
shall
deny
you
hereafter
admission
into
this
house
,
and
give
notice
now
that
I
require
your
instant
departure
.
<EOS>
Three
minutes
'
delay
will
render
it
involuntary
and
ignominious
.
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
measured
the
height
and
breadth
of
the
speaker
with
an
eye
full
of
derision
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cathy
,
this
lamb
of
yours
threatens
like
a
bull
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
in
danger
of
splitting
its
skull
against
my
knuckles
.
<EOS>
By
God
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
,
I
'm
mortally
sorry
that
you
are
not
worth
knocking
down
!
"
  
<EOS>
My
master
glanced
towards
the
passage
,
and
signed
me
to
fetch
the
men
:
he
had
no
intention
of
hazarding
a
personal
encounter
.
<EOS>
I
obeyed
the
hint
;
but
Mrs.
Linton
,
suspecting
something
,
followed
;
and
when
I
attempted
to
call
them
,
she
pulled
me
back
,
slammed
the
door
to
,
and
locked
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fair
means
!
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
in
answer
to
her
husband
's
look
of
angry
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
not
courage
to
attack
him
,
make
an
apology
,
or
allow
yourself
to
be
beaten
.
<EOS>
It
will
correct
you
of
feigning
more
valour
than
you
possess
.
<EOS>
No
,
I
'll
swallow
the
key
before
you
shall
get
it
!
<EOS>
I
'm
delightfully
rewarded
for
my
kindness
to
each
!
<EOS>
After
constant
indulgence
of
one
's
weak
nature
,
and
the
other
's
bad
one
,
I
earn
for
thanks
two
samples
of
blind
ingratitude
,
stupid
to
absurdity
!
<EOS>
Edgar
,
I
was
defending
you
and
yours
;
and
I
wish
Heathcliff
may
flog
you
sick
,
for
daring
to
think
an
evil
thought
of
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
did
not
need
the
medium
of
a
flogging
to
produce
that
effect
on
the
master
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
wrest
the
key
from
Catherine
's
grasp
,
and
for
safety
she
flung
it
into
the
hottest
part
of
the
fire
;
whereupon
Mr.
Edgar
was
taken
with
a
nervous
trembling
,
and
his
countenance
grew
deadly
pale
.
<EOS>
For
his
life
he
could
not
avert
that
excess
of
emotion
:
mingled
anguish
and
humiliation
overcame
him
completely
.
<EOS>
He
leant
on
the
back
of
a
chair
,
and
covered
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
heavens
!
<EOS>
In
old
days
this
would
win
you
knighthood
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
vanquished
!
<EOS>
we
are
vanquished
!
<EOS>
Heathcliff
would
as
soon
lift
a
finger
at
you
as
the
king
would
march
his
army
against
a
colony
of
mice
.
<EOS>
Cheer
up
!
<EOS>
you
sha'n't
be
hurt
!
<EOS>
Your
type
is
not
a
lamb
,
it
's
a
sucking
leveret
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
joy
of
the
milk
-
blooded
coward
,
Cathy
!
"
said
her
friend
.
<EOS>
"
I
compliment
you
on
your
taste
.
<EOS>
And
that
is
the
slavering
,
shivering
thing
you
preferred
to
me
!
<EOS>
I
would
not
strike
him
with
my
fist
,
but
I
'd
kick
him
with
my
foot
,
and
experience
considerable
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Is
he
weeping
,
or
is
he
going
to
faint
for
fear
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
fellow
approached
and
gave
the
chair
on
which
Linton
rested
a
push
.
<EOS>
He
'd
better
have
kept
his
distance
:
my
master
quickly
sprang
erect
,
and
struck
him
full
on
the
throat
a
blow
that
would
have
levelled
a
slighter
man
.
<EOS>
It
took
his
breath
for
a
minute
;
and
while
he
choked
,
Mr.
Linton
walked
out
by
the
back
door
into
the
yard
,
and
from
thence
to
the
front
entrance
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
you
've
done
with
coming
here
,
"
cried
Catherine
.
"
<EOS>
Get
away
,
now
;
he
'll
return
with
a
brace
of
pistols
and
half
-
a
-
dozen
assistants
.
<EOS>
If
he
did
overhear
us
,
of
course
he
'd
never
forgive
you
.
<EOS>
You
've
played
me
an
ill
turn
,
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
But
go
 
make
haste
!
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
see
Edgar
at
bay
than
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
suppose
I
'm
going
with
that
blow
burning
in
my
gullet
?
"
he
thundered
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
hell
,
no
!
<EOS>
I
'll
crush
his
ribs
in
like
a
rotten
hazel
-
nut
before
I
cross
the
threshold
!
<EOS>
If
I
do
n't
floor
him
now
,
I
shall
murder
him
some
time
;
so
,
as
you
value
his
existence
,
let
me
get
at
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
coming
,
"
I
interposed
,
framing
a
bit
of
a
lie
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
coachman
and
the
two
gardeners
;
you
'll
surely
not
wait
to
be
thrust
into
the
road
by
them
!
<EOS>
Each
has
a
bludgeon
;
and
master
will
,
very
likely
,
be
watching
from
the
parlour
-
windows
to
see
that
they
fulfil
his
orders
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
gardeners
and
coachman
were
there
:
but
Linton
was
with
them
.
<EOS>
They
had
already
entered
the
court
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
,
on
the
second
thoughts
,
resolved
to
avoid
a
struggle
against
three
underlings
:
he
seized
the
poker
,
smashed
the
lock
from
the
inner
door
,
and
made
his
escape
as
they
tramped
in
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
,
who
was
very
much
excited
,
bade
me
accompany
her
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
know
my
share
in
contributing
to
the
disturbance
,
and
I
was
anxious
to
keep
her
in
ignorance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
nearly
distracted
,
Nelly
!
"
she
exclaimed
,
throwing
herself
on
the
sofa
.
"
<EOS>
A
thousand
smiths
'
hammers
are
beating
in
my
head
!
<EOS>
Tell
Isabella
to
shun
me
;
this
uproar
is
owing
to
her
;
and
should
she
or
any
one
else
aggravate
my
anger
at
present
,
I
shall
get
wild
.
<EOS>
And
,
Nelly
,
say
to
Edgar
,
if
you
see
him
again
to
-
night
,
that
I
'm
in
danger
of
being
seriously
ill
.
<EOS>
I
wish
it
may
prove
true
.
<EOS>
He
has
startled
and
distressed
me
shockingly
!
<EOS>
I
want
to
frighten
him
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
might
come
and
begin
a
string
of
abuse
or
complainings
;
I
'm
certain
I
should
recriminate
,
and
God
knows
where
we
should
end
!
<EOS>
Will
you
do
so
,
my
good
<EOS>
Nelly
?
<EOS>
You
are
aware
that
I
am
no
way
blamable
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
What
possessed
him
to
turn
listener
?
<EOS>
Heathcliff
's
talk
was
outrageous
,
after
you
left
us
;
but
I
could
soon
have
diverted
him
from
Isabella
,
and
the
rest
meant
nothing
.
<EOS>
Now
all
is
dashed
wrong
;
by
the
fool
's
craving
to
hear
evil
of
self
,
that
haunts
some
people
like
a
demon
!
<EOS>
Had
Edgar
never
gathered
our
conversation
,
he
would
never
have
been
the
worse
for
it
.
<EOS>
Really
,
when
he
opened
on
me
in
that
unreasonable
tone
of
displeasure
after
I
had
scolded
Heathcliff
till
I
was
hoarse
for
him
,
I
did
not
care
hardly
what
they
did
to
each
other
;
especially
as
I
felt
that
,
however
the
scene
closed
,
we
should
all
be
driven
asunder
for
nobody
knows
how
long
!
<EOS>
Well
,
if
I
can
not
keep
Heathcliff
for
my
friend
 
if
Edgar
will
be
mean
and
jealous
,
I
'll
try
to
break
their
hearts
by
breaking
my
own
.
<EOS>
That
will
be
a
prompt
way
of
finishing
all
,
when
I
am
pushed
to
extremity
!
<EOS>
But
it
's
a
deed
to
be
reserved
for
a
forlorn
hope
;
I
'd
not
take
Linton
by
surprise
with
it
.
<EOS>
To
this
point
he
has
been
discreet
in
dreading
to
provoke
me
;
you
must
represent
the
peril
of
quitting
that
policy
,
and
remind
him
of
my
passionate
temper
,
verging
,
when
kindled
,
on
frenzy
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
could
dismiss
that
apathy
out
of
that
countenance
,
and
look
rather
more
anxious
about
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
stolidity
with
which
I
received
these
instructions
was
,
no
doubt
,
rather
exasperating
:
for
they
were
delivered
in
perfect
sincerity
;
but
I
believed
a
person
who
could
plan
the
turning
of
her
fits
of
passion
to
account
,
beforehand
,
might
,
by
exerting
her
will
,
manage
to
control
herself
tolerably
,
even
while
under
their
influence
;
and
I
did
not
wish
to
"
frighten
"
her
husband
,
as
she
said
,
and
multiply
his
annoyances
for
the
purpose
of
serving
her
selfishness
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
said
nothing
when
I
met
the
master
coming
towards
the
parlour
;
but
I
took
the
liberty
of
turning
back
to
listen
whether
they
would
resume
their
quarrel
together
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
speak
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
Remain
where
you
are
,
Catherine
,
"
he
said
;
without
any
anger
in
his
voice
,
but
with
much
sorrowful
despondency
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
stay
.
<EOS>
I
am
neither
come
to
wrangle
nor
be
reconciled
;
but
I
wish
just
to
learn
whether
,
after
this
evening
's
events
,
you
intend
to
continue
your
intimacy
with
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
for
mercy
's
sake
,
"
interrupted
the
mistress
,
stamping
her
foot
,
"
for
mercy
's
sake
,
let
us
hear
no
more
of
it
now
!
<EOS>
Your
cold
blood
can
not
be
worked
into
a
fever
:
your
veins
are
full
of
ice
-
water
;
but
mine
are
boiling
,
and
the
sight
of
such
chillness
makes
them
dance
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
get
rid
of
me
,
answer
my
question
,
"
persevered
Mr.
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
answer
it
;
and
that
violence
does
not
alarm
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
found
that
you
can
be
as
stoical
as
anyone
,
when
you
please
.
<EOS>
Will
you
give
up
Heathcliff
hereafter
,
or
will
you
give
up
me
?
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
for
you
to
be
_
<EOS>
my
_
friend
and
_
<EOS>
his
_
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
;
and
I
absolutely
_
require
_
to
know
which
you
choose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
require
to
be
let
alone
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Catherine
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
I
demand
it
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
I
can
scarcely
stand
?
<EOS>
Edgar
,
you
 
<EOS>
you
leave
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
rang
the
bell
till
it
broke
with
a
twang
;
I
entered
leisurely
.
<EOS>
It
was
enough
to
try
the
temper
of
a
saint
,
such
senseless
,
wicked
rages
!
<EOS>
There
she
lay
dashing
her
head
against
the
arm
of
the
sofa
,
and
grinding
her
teeth
,
so
that
you
might
fancy
she
would
crash
them
to
splinters
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
stood
looking
at
her
in
sudden
compunction
and
fear
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
to
fetch
some
water
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
breath
for
speaking
.
<EOS>
I
brought
a
glass
full
;
and
as
she
would
not
drink
,
I
sprinkled
it
on
her
face
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
seconds
she
stretched
herself
out
stiff
,
and
turned
up
her
eyes
,
while
her
cheeks
,
at
once
blanched
and
livid
,
assumed
the
aspect
of
death
.
<EOS>
Linton
looked
terrified
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
in
the
world
the
matter
,
"
I
whispered
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
want
him
to
yield
,
though
I
could
not
help
being
afraid
in
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
blood
on
her
lips
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
shuddering
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
answered
,
tartly
.
<EOS>
And
I
told
him
how
she
had
resolved
,
previous
to
his
coming
,
on
exhibiting
a
fit
of
frenzy
.
<EOS>
I
incautiously
gave
the
account
aloud
,
and
she
heard
me
;
for
she
started
up
 
her
hair
flying
over
her
shoulders
,
her
eyes
flashing
,
the
muscles
of
her
neck
and
arms
standing
out
preternaturally
.
<EOS>
I
made
up
my
mind
for
broken
bones
,
at
least
;
but
she
only
glared
about
her
for
an
instant
,
and
then
rushed
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
master
directed
me
to
follow
;
I
did
,
to
her
chamber
-
door
:
she
hindered
me
from
going
further
by
securing
it
against
me
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
never
offered
to
descend
to
breakfast
next
morning
,
I
went
to
ask
whether
she
would
have
some
carried
up
.
"
<EOS>
No
!
"
<EOS>
she
replied
,
peremptorily
.
<EOS>
The
same
question
was
repeated
at
dinner
and
tea
;
and
again
on
the
morrow
after
,
and
received
the
same
answer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
,
on
his
part
,
spent
his
time
in
the
library
,
and
did
not
inquire
concerning
his
wife
's
occupations
.
<EOS>
Isabella
and
he
had
had
an
hour
's
interview
,
during
which
he
tried
to
elicit
from
her
some
sentiment
of
proper
horror
for
Heathcliff
's
advances
:
but
he
could
make
nothing
of
her
evasive
replies
,
and
was
obliged
to
close
the
examination
unsatisfactorily
;
adding
,
however
,
a
solemn
warning
,
that
if
she
were
so
insane
as
to
encourage
that
worthless
suitor
,
it
would
dissolve
all
bonds
of
relationship
between
herself
and
him
.
    
<EOS>
While
Miss
Linton
moped
about
the
park
and
garden
,
always
silent
,
and
almost
always
in
tears
;
and
her
brother
shut
himself
up
among
books
that
he
never
opened
 
wearying
,
I
guessed
,
with
a
continual
vague
expectation
that
Catherine
,
repenting
her
conduct
,
would
come
of
her
own
accord
to
ask
pardon
,
and
seek
a
reconciliation
 
and
_
<EOS>
she
_
fasted
pertinaciously
,
under
the
idea
,
probably
,
that
at
every
meal
Edgar
was
ready
to
choke
for
her
absence
,
and
pride
alone
held
him
from
running
to
cast
himself
at
her
feet
;
I
went
about
my
household
duties
,
convinced
that
the
Grange
had
but
one
sensible
soul
in
its
walls
,
and
that
lodged
in
my
body
.
<EOS>
I
wasted
no
condolences
on
Miss
,
nor
any
expostulations
on
my
mistress
;
nor
did
I
pay
much
attention
to
the
sighs
of
my
master
,
who
yearned
to
hear
his
lady
's
name
,
since
he
might
not
hear
her
voice
.
<EOS>
I
determined
they
should
come
about
as
they
pleased
for
me
;
and
though
it
was
a
tiresomely
slow
process
,
I
began
to
rejoice
at
length
in
a
faint
dawn
of
its
progress
:
as
I
thought
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
,
on
the
third
day
,
unbarred
her
door
,
and
having
finished
the
water
in
her
pitcher
and
decanter
,
desired
a
renewed
supply
,
and
a
basin
of
gruel
,
for
she
believed
she
was
dying
.
<EOS>
That
I
set
down
as
a
speech
meant
for
Edgar
's
ears
;
I
believed
no
such
thing
,
so
I
kept
it
to
myself
and
brought
her
some
tea
and
dry
toast
.
<EOS>
She
ate
and
drank
eagerly
,
and
sank
back
on
her
pillow
again
,
clenching
her
hands
and
groaning
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
will
die
,
"
she
exclaimed
,
"
since
no
one
cares
anything
about
me
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
not
taken
that
.
"
<EOS>
Then
a
good
while
after
I
heard
her
murmur
,
"
No
,
I
'll
not
die
 
<EOS>
he
'd
be
glad
 
<EOS>
he
does
not
love
me
at
all
 
<EOS>
he
would
never
miss
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
want
anything
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
still
preserving
my
external
composure
,
in
spite
of
her
ghastly
countenance
and
strange
,
exaggerated
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
apathetic
being
doing
?
<EOS>
"
she
demanded
,
pushing
the
thick
entangled
locks
from
her
wasted
face
.
"
<EOS>
Has
he
fallen
into
a
lethargy
,
or
is
he
dead
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Neither
,
"
replied
I
;
"
if
you
mean
Mr.
Linton
.
<EOS>
He
's
tolerably
well
,
I
think
,
though
his
studies
occupy
him
rather
more
than
they
ought
:
he
is
continually
among
his
books
,
since
he
has
no
other
society
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
spoken
so
if
I
had
known
her
true
condition
,
but
I
could
not
get
rid
of
the
notion
that
she
acted
a
part
of
her
disorder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Among
his
books
!
"
she
cried
,
confounded
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
dying
!
<EOS>
I
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
!
<EOS>
My
God
!
does
he
know
how
I
'm
altered
?
<EOS>
"
continued
she
,
staring
at
her
reflection
in
a
mirror
hanging
against
the
opposite
wall
.
<EOS>
"
Is
that
Catherine
Linton
?
<EOS>
He
imagines
me
in
a
pet
 
in
play
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
Can
not
you
inform
him
that
it
is
frightful
earnest
?
<EOS>
Nelly
,
if
it
be
not
too
late
,
as
soon
as
I
learn
how
he
feels
,
I
'll
choose
between
these
two
:
either
to
starve
at
once
 
that
would
be
no
punishment
unless
he
had
a
heart
 
or
to
recover
,
and
leave
the
country
.
<EOS>
Are
you
speaking
the
truth
about
him
now
?
<EOS>
Take
care
.
<EOS>
Is
he
actually
so
utterly
indifferent
for
my
life
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
ma'am
,
<EOS>
"
I
answered
,
"
the
master
has
no
idea
of
your
being
deranged
;
and
of
course
he
does
not
fear
that
you
will
let
yourself
die
of
hunger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
not
?
<EOS>
Can
not
you
tell
him
I
will
?
"
she
returned
.
"
<EOS>
Persuade
him
!
<EOS>
speak
of
your
own
mind
:
<EOS>
say
you
are
certain
I
will
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
you
forget
,
Mrs.
Linton
,
"
I
suggested
,
"
that
you
have
eaten
some
food
with
a
relish
this
evening
,
and
to
-
morrow
you
will
perceive
its
good
effects
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
only
sure
it
would
kill
him
,
"
she
interrupted
,
"
I
'd
kill
myself
directly
!
<EOS>
These
three
awful
nights
I
've
never
closed
my
lids
 
<EOS>
and
oh
,
I
've
been
tormented
!
<EOS>
I
've
been
haunted
,
Nelly
!
<EOS>
But
I
begin
to
fancy
<EOS>
you
do
n't
like
me
.
<EOS>
How
strange
!
<EOS>
I
thought
,
though
everybody
hated
and
despised
each
other
,
they
could
not
avoid
loving
me
.
<EOS>
And
they
have
all
turned
to
enemies
in
a
few
hours
:
<EOS>
they
have
,
I
'm
positive
;
the
people
here
.
<EOS>
How
dreary
to
meet
death
,
surrounded
by
their
cold
faces
!
<EOS>
Isabella
,
terrified
and
repelled
,
afraid
to
enter
the
room
<EOS>
,
it
would
be
so
dreadful
to
watch
Catherine
go
.
<EOS>
And
Edgar
standing
solemnly
by
to
see
it
over
;
then
offering
prayers
of
thanks
to
God
for
restoring
peace
to
his
house
,
and
going
back
to
his
_
books
<EOS>
_
!
<EOS>
What
in
the
name
of
all
that
feels
has
he
to
do
with
_
books
<EOS>
_
,
when
I
am
dying
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
bear
the
notion
which
I
had
put
into
her
head
of
Mr.
Linton
's
philosophical
resignation
.
<EOS>
Tossing
about
,
she
increased
her
feverish
bewilderment
to
madness
,
and
tore
the
pillow
with
her
teeth
;
then
raising
herself
up
all
burning
,
desired
that
I
would
open
the
window
.
<EOS>
We
were
in
the
middle
of
winter
,
the
wind
blew
strong
from
the
north
-
east
,
and
I
objected
.
<EOS>
Both
the
expressions
flitting
over
her
face
,
and
the
changes
of
her
moods
,
began
to
alarm
me
terribly
;
and
brought
to
my
recollection
her
former
illness
,
and
the
doctor
's
injunction
that
she
should
not
be
crossed
.
<EOS>
A
minute
previously
she
was
violent
;
now
,
supported
on
one
arm
,
and
not
noticing
my
refusal
to
obey
her
,
she
seemed
to
find
childish
diversion
in
pulling
the
feathers
from
the
rents
she
had
just
made
,
and
ranging
them
on
the
sheet
according
to
their
different
species
:
her
mind
had
strayed
to
other
associations
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
turkey
's
,
"
she
murmured
to
herself
;
"
and
this
is
a
wild
duck
's
;
and
this
is
a
pigeon
's
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
they
put
pigeons
'
feathers
in
the
pillows
 
no
wonder
I
could
n't
die
!
<EOS>
Let
me
take
care
to
throw
it
on
the
floor
when
I
lie
down
.
<EOS>
And
here
is
a
moor
-
cock
's
;
and
this
 
<EOS>
I
should
know
it
among
a
thousand
 
<EOS>
it
's
a
lapwing
's
.
<EOS>
Bonny
bird
;
wheeling
over
our
heads
in
the
middle
of
the
moor
.
<EOS>
It
wanted
to
get
to
its
nest
,
for
the
clouds
had
touched
the
swells
,
and
it
felt
rain
coming
.
<EOS>
This
feather
was
picked
up
from
the
heath
,
the
bird
was
not
shot
<EOS>
:
we
saw
its
nest
in
the
winter
,
full
of
little
skeletons
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
set
a
trap
over
it
,
and
the
old
ones
dared
not
come
.
<EOS>
I
made
him
promise
he
'd
never
shoot
a
lapwing
after
that
,
and
he
did
n't
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
here
are
more
!
<EOS>
Did
he
shoot
my
lapwings
,
Nelly
?
<EOS>
Are
they
red
,
any
of
them
?
<EOS>
Let
me
look
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
over
with
that
baby
-
work
!
"
<EOS>
I
interrupted
,
dragging
the
pillow
away
,
and
turning
the
holes
towards
the
mattress
,
for
she
was
removing
its
contents
by
handfuls
.
"
<EOS>
Lie
down
and
shut
your
eyes
:
you
're
wandering
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
mess
!
<EOS>
The
down
is
flying
about
like
snow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
went
here
and
there
collecting
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
in
you
,
Nelly
,
"
she
continued
dreamily
,
"
an
aged
woman
:
you
have
grey
hair
and
bent
shoulders
.
<EOS>
This
bed
is
the
fairy
cave
under
Penistone
crags
,
and
you
are
gathering
elf
-
bolts
to
hurt
our
heifers
;
pretending
,
while
I
am
near
,
that
they
are
only
locks
of
wool
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
you
'll
come
to
fifty
years
hence
:
<EOS>
I
know
you
are
not
so
now
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
wandering
<EOS>
:
you
're
mistaken
,
or
else
<EOS>
I
should
believe
you
really
_
were
_
<EOS>
that
withered
hag
,
and
<EOS>
I
should
think
I
_
was
_
under
Penistone
Crags
;
and
I
'm
conscious
it
's
night
,
and
there
are
two
candles
on
the
table
making
the
black
press
shine
like
jet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
black
press
?
<EOS>
where
is
that
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
talking
in
your
sleep
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
against
the
wall
,
as
it
always
is
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
It
_
does
_
appear
odd
 
<EOS>
I
see
a
face
in
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
press
in
the
room
,
and
never
was
,
"
said
I
,
resuming
my
seat
,
and
looping
up
the
curtain
that
I
might
watch
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
see
that
face
?
<EOS>
"
she
inquired
,
gazing
earnestly
at
the
mirror
.
  
<EOS>
And
say
what
I
could
,
I
was
incapable
of
making
her
comprehend
it
to
be
her
own
;
so
I
rose
and
covered
it
with
a
shawl
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
behind
there
still
!
"
<EOS>
she
pursued
,
anxiously
.
"
<EOS>
And
it
stirred
.
<EOS>
Who
is
it
?
<EOS>
I
hope
it
will
not
come
out
when
you
are
gone
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Nelly
,
the
room
is
haunted
!
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
of
being
alone
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
took
her
hand
in
mine
,
and
bid
her
be
composed
;
for
a
succession
of
shudders
convulsed
her
frame
,
and
she
would
keep
straining
her
gaze
towards
the
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
nobody
here
!
<EOS>
"
I
insisted
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
_
yourself
_
,
Mrs.
Linton
:
you
knew
it
a
while
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Myself
!
<EOS>
"
she
gasped
,
"
and
the
clock
is
striking
twelve
!
<EOS>
It
's
true
,
then
!
<EOS>
that
's
dreadful
!
"
  
<EOS>
Her
fingers
clutched
the
clothes
,
and
gathered
them
over
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
attempted
to
steal
to
the
door
with
an
intention
of
calling
her
husband
;
but
I
was
summoned
back
by
a
piercing
shriek
 
<EOS>
the
shawl
had
dropped
from
the
frame
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
is
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
cried
I.
"
<EOS>
Who
is
coward
now
?
<EOS>
Wake
up
!
<EOS>
That
is
the
glass
 
<EOS>
the
mirror
,
Mrs.
Linton
;
and
you
see
yourself
in
it
,
and
there
am
I
too
by
your
side
.
"
  
<EOS>
Trembling
and
bewildered
<EOS>
,
she
held
me
fast
,
but
the
horror
gradually
passed
from
her
countenance
;
its
paleness
gave
place
to
a
glow
of
shame
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
I
thought
I
was
at
home
,
"
she
sighed
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
was
lying
in
my
chamber
at
Wuthering
Heights
.
<EOS>
Because
I
'm
weak
,
my
brain
got
confused
,
and
I
screamed
unconsciously
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
say
anything
;
but
stay
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
dread
sleeping
:
my
dreams
appal
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
sound
sleep
would
do
you
<EOS>
good
,
ma'am
<EOS>
,
"
I
answered
:
"
<EOS>
and
I
hope
this
suffering
will
prevent
your
trying
starving
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
if
I
were
but
in
my
own
bed
in
the
old
house
!
"
she
went
on
bitterly
,
wringing
her
hands
.
"
<EOS>
And
that
wind
sounding
in
the
firs
by
the
lattice
.
<EOS>
Do
let
me
feel
it
 
<EOS>
it
comes
straight
down
the
moor
 
<EOS>
do
let
me
have
one
breath
!
"
<EOS>
To
pacify
her
I
held
the
casement
ajar
a
few
seconds
.
<EOS>
A
cold
blast
rushed
through
;
I
closed
it
,
and
returned
to
my
post
.
<EOS>
She
lay
still
now
,
her
face
bathed
in
tears
.
<EOS>
Exhaustion
of
body
had
entirely
subdued
her
spirit
:
our
fiery
Catherine
was
no
better
than
a
wailing
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
is
it
since
I
shut
myself
in
here
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
suddenly
reviving
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
Monday
evening
,
"
I
replied
,
"
and
this
is
Thursday
night
,
or
rather
Friday
morning
,
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
of
the
same
week
?
<EOS>
"
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
that
brief
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Long
enough
to
live
on
nothing
but
cold
water
and
ill
-
temper
,
"
observed
I.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
seems
a
weary
number
of
hours
,
"
she
muttered
doubtfully
:
"
it
must
be
more
.
<EOS>
I
remember
being
in
the
parlour
after
they
had
quarrelled
,
and
Edgar
being
cruelly
provoking
,
and
me
running
into
this
room
desperate
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
ever
I
had
barred
the
door
,
utter
blackness
overwhelmed
me
,
and
I
fell
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
explain
to
Edgar
<EOS>
how
certain
I
felt
of
having
a
fit
,
or
going
raging
mad
,
if
he
persisted
in
teasing
me
!
<EOS>
I
had
no
command
of
tongue
,
or
brain
,
and
he
did
not
guess
my
agony
,
perhaps
<EOS>
:
it
barely
left
me
sense
to
try
to
escape
from
him
and
his
voice
.
<EOS>
Before
I
recovered
sufficiently
to
see
and
hear
,
it
began
to
be
dawn
,
and
,
Nelly
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
thought
,
and
what
has
kept
recurring
and
recurring
till
I
feared
for
my
reason
.
<EOS>
I
thought
as
I
lay
there
,
with
my
head
against
that
table
leg
,
and
my
eyes
dimly
discerning
the
grey
square
of
the
window
,
that
I
was
enclosed
in
the
oak
-
panelled
bed
at
home
;
and
my
heart
ached
with
some
great
grief
which
,
just
waking
,
I
could
not
recollect
.
<EOS>
I
pondered
,
and
worried
myself
to
discover
what
it
could
be
,
and
,
most
strangely
,
the
whole
last
seven
years
of
my
life
grew
a
blank
!
<EOS>
I
did
not
recall
that
they
had
been
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
child
;
my
father
was
just
buried
,
and
my
misery
arose
from
the
separation
that
Hindley
had
ordered
between
me
and
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
I
was
laid
alone
,
for
the
first
time
;
and
,
rousing
from
a
dismal
doze
after
a
night
of
weeping
,
I
lifted
my
hand
to
push
the
panels
aside
:
it
struck
the
table
-
top
!
<EOS>
I
swept
it
along
the
carpet
,
and
then
memory
burst
in
:
<EOS>
my
late
anguish
was
swallowed
in
a
paroxysm
of
despair
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
why
I
felt
so
wildly
wretched
:
it
must
have
been
temporary
derangement
;
for
there
is
scarcely
cause
.
<EOS>
But
,
supposing
at
twelve
years
old
I
had
been
wrenched
from
the
Heights
,
and
every
early
association
,
and
my
all
in
all
,
as
Heathcliff
was
at
that
time
,
and
been
converted
at
a
stroke
into
Mrs.
Linton
,
the
lady
of
Thrushcross
Grange
,
and
the
wife
of
a
stranger
:
an
exile
,
and
outcast
,
thenceforth
,
from
what
had
been
my
world
.
<EOS>
You
may
fancy
a
glimpse
of
the
abyss
where
I
grovelled
!
<EOS>
Shake
your
head
as
you
will
,
Nelly
,
you
have
helped
to
unsettle
me
!
<EOS>
You
should
have
spoken
to
Edgar
,
indeed
you
should
,
and
compelled
him
to
leave
me
quiet
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
'm
burning
!
<EOS>
I
wish
I
were
out
of
doors
!
<EOS>
I
wish
I
were
a
girl
again
,
half
savage
and
hardy
,
and
free
;
and
laughing
at
injuries
,
not
maddening
under
them
!
<EOS>
Why
am
I
so
changed
?
<EOS>
why
does
my
blood
rush
into
a
hell
of
tumult
at
a
few
words
?
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
should
be
myself
were
I
once
among
the
heather
on
those
hills
.
<EOS>
Open
the
window
again
wide
:
fasten
it
open
!
<EOS>
Quick
,
why
do
n't
you
move
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
wo
n't
give
you
your
death
of
cold
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
give
me
a
chance
of
life
,
you
mean
,
"
she
said
,
sullenly
.
"
<EOS>
However
,
I
'm
not
helpless
yet
;
I
'll
open
it
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
sliding
from
the
bed
before
I
could
hinder
her
,
she
crossed
the
room
,
walking
very
uncertainly
,
threw
it
back
,
and
bent
out
,
careless
of
the
frosty
air
that
cut
about
her
shoulders
as
keen
as
a
knife
.
<EOS>
I
entreated
,
and
finally
attempted
to
force
her
to
retire
.
<EOS>
But
I
soon
found
her
delirious
strength
much
surpassed
mine
<EOS>
(
she
was
delirious
,
I
became
convinced
by
her
subsequent
actions
and
ravings
)
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
moon
,
and
everything
beneath
lay
in
misty
darkness
:
not
a
light
gleamed
from
any
house
,
far
or
near
all
had
been
extinguished
long
ago
:
and
those
at
Wuthering
Heights
were
never
visible
 
<EOS>
still
she
asserted
she
caught
their
shining
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
eagerly
,
"
that
's
my
room
with
the
candle
in
it
,
and
the
trees
swaying
before
it
;
and
the
other
candle
is
in
Joseph
's
garret
.
<EOS>
Joseph
sits
up
late
,
does
n't
he
?
<EOS>
He
's
waiting
till
I
come
home
that
he
may
lock
the
gate
.
<EOS>
Well
,
he
'll
wait
a
while
yet
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
rough
journey
,
and
a
sad
heart
to
travel
it
;
and
we
must
pass
by
Gimmerton
Kirk
to
go
that
journey
!
<EOS>
We
've
braved
its
ghosts
often
together
,
and
dared
each
other
to
stand
among
the
graves
and
ask
them
to
come
.
<EOS>
But
,
Heathcliff
,
if
I
dare
you
now
,
will
you
venture
?
<EOS>
If
you
do
,
I
'll
keep
you
.
<EOS>
I
'll
not
lie
there
by
myself
:
they
may
bury
me
twelve
feet
deep
,
and
throw
the
church
down
over
me
,
but
I
wo
n't
rest
till
you
are
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
never
will
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
,
and
resumed
with
a
strange
smile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
considering
 
he
'd
<EOS>
rather
I
'd
come
to
him
!
<EOS>
Find
a
way
,
then
!
<EOS>
not
through
that
kirkyard
.
<EOS>
You
are
slow
!
<EOS>
Be
content
,
you
always
followed
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
Perceiving
it
vain
to
argue
against
her
insanity
,
I
was
planning
how
I
could
reach
something
to
wrap
about
her
,
without
quitting
my
hold
of
herself
(
for
I
could
not
trust
her
alone
by
the
gaping
lattice
)
,
when
,
to
my
consternation
,
I
heard
the
rattle
of
the
door
-
handle
,
and
Mr.
Linton
entered
.
<EOS>
He
had
only
then
come
from
the
library
;
and
,
in
passing
through
the
lobby
,
had
noticed
our
talking
and
been
attracted
by
curiosity
,
or
fear
,
to
examine
what
it
signified
,
at
that
late
hour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
,
checking
the
exclamation
risen
to
his
lips
at
the
sight
which
met
him
,
and
the
bleak
atmosphere
of
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
"
My
poor
mistress
is
ill
,
and
she
quite
masters
me
:
I
can
not
manage
her
at
all
;
pray
,
come
and
persuade
her
to
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Forget
your
anger
,
for
she
's
hard
to
guide
any
way
but
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Catherine
ill
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
hastening
to
us
.
"
<EOS>
Shut
the
window
,
Ellen
!
<EOS>
Catherine
!
<EOS>
why
 
"
  
He
was
silent
.
<EOS>
The
haggardness
of
Mrs.
Linton
's
appearance
smote
him
speechless
,
and
he
could
only
glance
from
her
to
me
in
horrified
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
been
fretting
here
,
"
I
continued
,
"
and
eating
scarcely
anything
,
and
never
complaining
:
she
would
admit
none
of
us
till
this
evening
,
and
so
we
could
n't
inform
you
of
her
state
,
as
we
were
not
aware
of
it
ourselves
;
but
it
is
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
felt
I
uttered
my
explanations
awkwardly
;
the
master
frowned
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
nothing
,
is
it
,
Ellen
Dean
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
account
more
clearly
for
keeping
me
ignorant
of
this
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
took
his
wife
in
his
arms
,
and
looked
at
her
with
anguish
.
  
<EOS>
At
first
she
gave
him
no
glance
of
recognition
:
he
was
invisible
to
her
abstracted
gaze
.
<EOS>
The
delirium
was
not
fixed
,
however
;
having
weaned
her
eyes
from
contemplating
the
outer
darkness
,
by
degrees
she
centred
her
attention
on
him
,
and
discovered
who
it
was
that
held
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
are
come
,
are
you
,
Edgar
Linton
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
with
angry
animation
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
one
of
those
things
that
are
ever
found
when
least
wanted
,
and
when
you
are
wanted
,
never
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
shall
have
plenty
of
lamentations
now
 
<EOS>
I
see
we
shall
 
<EOS>
but
they
ca
n't
keep
me
from
my
narrow
home
out
yonder
:
<EOS>
my
resting
-
place
,
where
I
'm
bound
before
spring
is
over
!
<EOS>
There
it
is
:
not
among
the
Lintons
,
mind
,
under
the
chapel
-
roof
,
but
in
the
open
air
,
with
a
head
-
stone
;
and
you
may
please
yourself
whether
you
go
to
them
or
come
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Catherine
,
what
have
you
done
?
"
commenced
the
master
.
"
<EOS>
Am
I
nothing
to
you
any
more
?
<EOS>
Do
you
love
that
wretch
Heath
 
"
  
"
Hush
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
this
moment
!
<EOS>
You
mention
that
name
<EOS>
and
I
end
the
matter
instantly
by
a
spring
from
the
window
!
<EOS>
What
you
touch
at
present
you
may
have
;
but
my
soul
will
be
on
that
hill
-
top
before
you
lay
hands
on
me
again
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
you
,
Edgar
:
<EOS>
I
'm
past
wanting
you
.
<EOS>
Return
to
your
books
.
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
you
possess
a
consolation
,
for
all
you
had
in
me
is
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
mind
wanders
,
sir
,
"
I
interposed
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
talking
nonsense
the
whole
evening
;
but
let
her
have
quiet
,
and
proper
attendance
,
and
she
'll
rally
.
<EOS>
Hereafter
,
we
must
be
cautious
how
we
vex
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
desire
no
further
advice
from
you
,
"
answered
Mr.
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
You
knew
your
mistress
's
nature
,
and
you
encouraged
me
to
harass
her
.
<EOS>
And
not
to
give
me
one
hint
of
how
she
has
been
these
three
days
!
<EOS>
It
was
heartless
!
<EOS>
Months
of
sickness
could
not
cause
such
a
change
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
began
to
defend
myself
,
thinking
it
too
bad
to
be
blamed
for
another
's
wicked
waywardness
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
Mrs.
Linton
's
nature
to
be
headstrong
and
domineering
,
"
cried
I
:
"
but
I
did
n't
know
that
you
wished
to
foster
her
fierce
temper
!
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
that
,
to
humour
her
,
I
should
wink
at
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
I
performed
the
duty
of
a
faithful
servant
in
telling
you
,
and
I
have
got
a
faithful
servant
's
wages
!
<EOS>
Well
,
it
will
teach
me
to
be
careful
next
time
.
<EOS>
Next
time
you
may
gather
intelligence
for
yourself
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
next
time
you
bring
a
tale
to
me
<EOS>
you
shall
quit
my
service
,
Ellen
Dean
,
"
he
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'd
rather
hear
nothing
about
it
,
I
suppose
,
then
,
Mr.
Linton
?
"
said
I.
"
Heathcliff
has
your
permission
to
come
a
-
courting
to
Miss
,
and
to
drop
in
at
every
opportunity
your
absence
offers
,
on
purpose
to
poison
the
mistress
against
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Confused
as
Catherine
was
,
her
wits
were
alert
at
applying
our
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Nelly
has
played
traitor
,
"
she
exclaimed
,
passionately
.
"
<EOS>
Nelly
is
my
hidden
enemy
.
<EOS>
You
witch
!
<EOS>
So
you
do
seek
elf
-
bolts
to
hurt
us
!
<EOS>
Let
me
go
,
and
I
'll
make
her
rue
!
<EOS>
I
'll
make
her
howl
a
recantation
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
maniac
's
fury
kindled
under
her
brows
;
she
struggled
desperately
to
disengage
herself
from
Linton
's
arms
.
<EOS>
I
felt
no
inclination
to
tarry
the
event
;
and
,
resolving
to
seek
medical
aid
on
my
own
responsibility
,
I
quitted
the
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
In
passing
the
garden
to
reach
the
road
,
at
a
place
where
a
bridle
hook
is
driven
into
the
wall
,
I
saw
something
white
moved
irregularly
,
evidently
by
another
agent
than
the
wind
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
my
hurry
,
I
stayed
to
examine
it
,
lest
ever
after
I
should
have
the
conviction
impressed
on
my
imagination
that
it
was
a
creature
of
the
other
world
.
<EOS>
My
surprise
and
perplexity
were
great
on
discovering
,
by
touch
more
than
vision
,
Miss
Isabella
's
springer
,
Fanny
,
suspended
by
a
handkerchief
,
and
nearly
at
its
last
gasp
.
<EOS>
I
quickly
released
the
animal
,
and
lifted
it
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
it
follow
its
mistress
up
-
stairs
when
she
went
to
bed
;
and
wondered
much
how
it
could
have
got
out
there
,
and
what
mischievous
person
had
treated
it
so
.
<EOS>
While
untying
the
knot
round
the
hook
,
it
seemed
to
me
that
I
repeatedly
caught
the
beat
of
horses
'
feet
galloping
at
some
distance
;
but
there
were
such
a
number
of
things
to
occupy
my
reflections
that
I
hardly
gave
the
circumstance
a
thought
:
though
it
was
a
strange
sound
,
in
that
place
,
at
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kenneth
was
fortunately
just
issuing
from
his
house
to
see
a
patient
in
the
village
as
I
came
up
the
street
;
and
my
account
of
Catherine
Linton
's
malady
induced
him
to
accompany
me
back
immediately
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
plain
rough
man
;
and
he
made
no
scruple
to
speak
his
doubts
of
her
surviving
this
second
attack
;
unless
she
were
more
submissive
to
his
directions
than
she
had
shown
herself
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nelly
Dean
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
ca
n't
help
fancying
there
's
an
extra
cause
for
this
.
<EOS>
What
has
there
been
to
do
at
the
Grange
?
<EOS>
We
've
odd
reports
up
here
.
<EOS>
A
stout
,
hearty
lass
like
Catherine
does
not
fall
ill
for
a
trifle
;
and
that
sort
of
people
should
not
either
.
<EOS>
It
's
hard
work
bringing
them
through
fevers
,
and
such
things
.
<EOS>
How
did
it
begin
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
master
will
inform
you
,
"
I
answered
;
"
but
you
are
acquainted
with
the
Earnshaws
'
violent
dispositions
,
and
Mrs.
Linton
caps
them
all
.
<EOS>
I
may
say
this
;
it
commenced
in
a
quarrel
.
<EOS>
She
was
struck
during
a
tempest
of
passion
with
a
kind
of
fit
.
<EOS>
That
's
her
account
,
at
least
:
for
she
flew
off
in
the
height
of
it
,
and
locked
herself
up
.
<EOS>
Afterwards
,
she
refused
to
eat
,
and
now
she
alternately
raves
and
remains
in
a
half
dream
;
knowing
those
about
her
,
but
having
her
mind
filled
with
all
sorts
of
strange
ideas
and
illusions
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Linton
will
be
sorry
?
"
observed
Kenneth
,
interrogatively
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sorry
?
<EOS>
he
'll
break
his
heart
<EOS>
should
anything
happen
!
<EOS>
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
alarm
him
more
than
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
told
him
to
beware
,
"
said
my
companion
;
"
and
he
must
bide
the
consequences
of
neglecting
my
warning
!
<EOS>
Has
n't
he
been
intimate
with
Mr.
Heathcliff
lately
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Heathcliff
frequently
visits
at
the
Grange
,
"
answered
I
,
"
though
more
on
the
strength
of
the
mistress
having
known
him
when
a
boy
,
than
because
the
master
likes
his
company
.
<EOS>
At
present
he
's
discharged
from
the
trouble
of
calling
;
owing
to
some
presumptuous
aspirations
after
Miss
Linton
which
he
manifested
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
think
he
'll
be
taken
in
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
does
Miss
Linton
turn
a
cold
shoulder
on
him
?
"
was
the
doctor
's
next
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
in
her
confidence
,
"
returned
I
,
reluctant
to
continue
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
she
's
a
sly
one
,
"
he
remarked
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
keeps
her
own
counsel
!
<EOS>
But
she
's
a
real
little
fool
.
<EOS>
I
have
it
from
good
authority
that
last
night
(
and
a
pretty
night
it
was
!
)
<EOS>
she
and
Heathcliff
were
walking
in
the
plantation
at
the
back
of
your
house
above
two
hours
;
and
he
pressed
her
not
to
go
in
again
,
but
just
mount
his
horse
and
away
with
him
!
<EOS>
My
informant
said
she
could
only
put
him
off
by
pledging
her
word
of
honour
to
be
prepared
on
their
first
meeting
after
that
:
when
it
was
to
be
he
did
n't
hear
;
but
you
urge
Mr.
Linton
to
look
sharp
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
news
filled
me
with
fresh
fears
;
I
outstripped
Kenneth
,
and
ran
most
of
the
way
back
.
<EOS>
The
little
dog
was
yelping
in
the
garden
yet
.
<EOS>
I
spared
a
minute
to
open
the
gate
for
it
,
but
instead
of
going
to
the
house
door
,
it
coursed
up
and
down
snuffing
the
grass
,
and
would
have
escaped
to
the
road
,
had
I
not
seized
it
and
conveyed
it
in
with
me
.
<EOS>
On
ascending
to
Isabella
's
room
,
my
suspicions
were
confirmed
:
it
was
empty
.
<EOS>
Had
I
been
a
few
hours
sooner
Mrs.
Linton
's
illness
might
have
arrested
her
rash
step
.
<EOS>
But
what
could
be
done
now
?
<EOS>
There
was
a
bare
possibility
of
overtaking
them
if
pursued
instantly
.
<EOS>
_
I
_
could
not
pursue
them
,
however
;
and
I
dared
not
rouse
the
family
,
and
fill
the
place
with
confusion
;
still
less
unfold
the
business
to
my
master
,
absorbed
as
he
was
in
his
present
calamity
,
and
having
no
heart
to
spare
for
a
second
grief
!
<EOS>
I
saw
nothing
for
it
but
to
hold
my
tongue
,
and
suffer
matters
to
take
their
course
;
and
Kenneth
being
arrived
,
I
went
with
a
badly
composed
countenance
to
announce
him
.
<EOS>
Catherine
lay
in
a
troubled
sleep
<EOS>
:
her
husband
had
succeeded
in
soothing
the
excess
of
frenzy
;
he
now
hung
over
her
pillow
,
watching
every
shade
and
every
change
of
her
painfully
expressive
features
.
  
<EOS>
The
doctor
,
on
examining
the
case
for
himself
,
spoke
hopefully
to
him
of
its
having
a
favourable
termination
,
if
we
could
only
preserve
around
her
perfect
and
constant
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
To
me
,
he
signified
the
threatening
danger
was
not
so
much
death
,
as
permanent
alienation
of
intellect
.
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
close
my
eyes
that
night
,
nor
did
Mr.
Linton
:
indeed
,
we
never
went
to
bed
;
and
the
servants
were
all
up
long
before
the
usual
hour
,
moving
through
the
house
with
stealthy
tread
,
and
exchanging
whispers
as
they
encountered
each
other
in
their
vocations
.
<EOS>
Every
one
was
active
but
Miss
Isabella
;
and
they
began
to
remark
how
sound
she
slept
:
<EOS>
her
brother
,
too
,
asked
if
she
had
risen
,
and
seemed
impatient
for
her
presence
,
and
hurt
that
she
showed
so
little
anxiety
for
her
sister
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
I
trembled
lest
he
should
send
me
to
call
her
;
but
I
was
spared
the
pain
of
being
the
first
proclaimant
of
her
flight
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
maids
,
a
thoughtless
girl
,
who
had
been
on
an
early
errand
to
Gimmerton
,
came
panting
up
-
stairs
,
open
-
mouthed
,
and
dashed
into
the
chamber
,
crying
:
"
Oh
,
dear
,
dear
!
<EOS>
What
mun
we
have
next
?
<EOS>
Master
,
master
,
our
young
lady
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hold
your
noise
!
"
<EOS>
cried
,
I
hastily
,
enraged
at
her
clamorous
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
lower
,
Mary
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
matter
?
"
said
Mr.
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
What
ails
your
young
lady
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
gone
,
she
's
gone
!
<EOS>
Yon
'
Heathcliff
's
run
off
wi
'
her
!
"
<EOS>
gasped
the
girl
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
true
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Linton
,
rising
in
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
:
how
has
the
idea
entered
your
head
?
<EOS>
Ellen
Dean
,
go
and
seek
her
.
<EOS>
It
is
incredible
:
it
can
not
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
he
took
the
servant
to
the
door
,
and
then
repeated
his
demand
to
know
her
reasons
for
such
an
assertion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
met
on
the
road
a
lad
that
fetches
milk
here
,
"
she
stammered
,
"
and
he
asked
whether
we
were
n't
in
trouble
at
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
meant
for
missis
's
sickness
,
so
I
answered
,
yes
.
<EOS>
Then
says
he
,
"
There
's
somebody
gone
after
'em
,
I
guess
?
<EOS>
"
I
stared
.
<EOS>
He
saw
I
knew
nought
about
it
,
and
he
told
how
a
gentleman
and
lady
had
stopped
to
have
a
horse
's
shoe
fastened
at
a
blacksmith
's
shop
,
two
miles
out
of
Gimmerton
,
not
very
long
after
midnight
!
<EOS>
and
how
the
blacksmith
's
lass
had
got
up
to
spy
who
they
were
:
she
knew
them
both
directly
.
<EOS>
And
she
noticed
the
man
 
Heathcliff
<EOS>
it
was
,
she
felt
certain
:
nob'dy
could
mistake
him
,
besides
 
put
a
sovereign
in
her
father
's
hand
for
payment
.
<EOS>
The
lady
had
a
cloak
about
her
face
;
but
having
desired
a
sup
of
water
,
while
she
drank
it
fell
back
,
and
she
saw
her
very
plain
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
held
both
bridles
as
they
rode
on
,
and
they
set
their
faces
from
the
village
,
and
went
as
fast
as
the
rough
roads
would
let
them
.
<EOS>
The
lass
said
nothing
to
her
father
,
but
she
told
it
all
over
Gimmerton
this
morning
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
ran
and
peeped
,
for
form
's
sake
,
into
Isabella
's
room
;
confirming
,
when
I
returned
,
the
servant
's
statement
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
had
resumed
his
seat
by
the
bed
;
on
my
re
-
entrance
,
he
raised
his
eyes
,
read
the
meaning
of
my
blank
aspect
,
and
dropped
them
without
giving
an
order
,
or
uttering
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
we
to
try
any
measures
for
overtaking
and
bringing
her
back
,
"
I
inquired
.
<EOS>
"
How
should
we
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
went
of
her
own
accord
,
"
answered
the
master
;
"
she
had
a
right
to
go
if
she
pleased
.
<EOS>
Trouble
me
no
more
about
her
.
<EOS>
Hereafter
she
is
only
my
sister
in
name
:
not
because
I
disown
her
,
but
because
she
has
disowned
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
that
was
all
he
said
on
the
subject
<EOS>
:
he
did
not
make
single
inquiry
further
,
or
mention
her
in
any
way
,
except
directing
me
to
send
what
property
she
had
in
the
house
to
her
fresh
home
,
wherever
it
was
,
when
I
knew
it
.
    
<EOS>
For
two
months
the
fugitives
remained
absent
;
in
those
two
months
,
Mrs.
Linton
encountered
and
conquered
the
worst
shock
of
what
was
denominated
a
brain
fever
.
<EOS>
No
mother
could
have
nursed
an
only
child
more
devotedly
than
Edgar
tended
her
.
<EOS>
Day
and
night
he
was
watching
,
and
patiently
enduring
all
the
annoyances
that
irritable
nerves
and
a
shaken
reason
could
inflict
;
and
,
though
Kenneth
remarked
that
what
he
saved
from
the
grave
would
only
recompense
his
care
by
forming
the
source
of
constant
future
anxiety
 
in
fact
,
that
his
health
and
strength
were
being
sacrificed
to
preserve
a
mere
ruin
of
humanity
 
he
knew
no
limits
in
gratitude
and
joy
when
Catherine
's
life
was
declared
out
of
danger
;
and
hour
after
hour
he
would
sit
beside
her
,
tracing
the
gradual
return
to
bodily
health
,
and
flattering
his
too
sanguine
hopes
with
the
illusion
that
her
mind
would
settle
back
to
its
right
balance
also
,
and
she
would
soon
be
entirely
her
former
self
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
time
she
left
her
chamber
was
at
the
commencement
of
the
following
March
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
had
put
on
her
pillow
,
in
the
morning
,
a
handful
of
golden
crocuses
;
her
eye
,
long
stranger
to
any
gleam
of
pleasure
,
caught
them
in
waking
,
and
shone
delighted
as
she
gathered
them
eagerly
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
These
are
the
earliest
flowers
at
the
Heights
,
"
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
They
remind
me
of
soft
thaw
winds
,
and
warm
sunshine
,
and
nearly
melted
snow
.
<EOS>
Edgar
,
is
there
not
a
south
wind
,
and
is
not
the
snow
almost
gone
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
snow
is
quite
gone
down
here
,
darling
,
"
replied
her
husband
;
"
and
I
only
see
two
white
spots
on
the
whole
range
of
moors
:
the
sky
is
blue
,
and
the
larks
are
singing
,
and
the
becks
and
brooks
are
all
brim
full
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
last
spring
at
this
time
,
I
was
longing
to
have
you
under
this
roof
;
now
,
I
wish
you
were
a
mile
or
two
up
those
hills
<EOS>
:
the
air
blows
so
sweetly
,
I
feel
that
it
would
cure
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
be
there
<EOS>
but
once
more
,
"
said
the
invalid
;
"
and
then
you
'll
leave
me
,
and
I
shall
remain
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Next
spring
you
'll
long
again
to
have
me
under
this
roof
,
and
you
'll
look
back
and
think
you
were
happy
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Linton
lavished
on
her
the
kindest
caresses
,
and
tried
to
cheer
her
by
the
fondest
words
;
but
,
vaguely
regarding
the
flowers
,
she
let
the
tears
collect
on
her
lashes
and
stream
down
her
cheeks
unheeding
.
<EOS>
We
knew
she
was
really
better
,
and
,
therefore
,
decided
that
long
confinement
to
a
single
place
produced
much
of
this
despondency
,
and
it
might
be
partially
removed
by
a
change
of
scene
.
<EOS>
The
master
told
me
to
light
a
fire
in
the
many
-
weeks
'
deserted
parlour
,
and
to
set
an
easy
-
chair
in
the
sunshine
by
the
window
;
and
then
he
brought
her
down
,
and
she
sat
a
long
while
enjoying
the
genial
heat
,
and
,
as
we
expected
,
revived
by
the
objects
<EOS>
round
her
:
<EOS>
which
,
though
familiar
,
were
free
from
the
dreary
associations
investing
her
hated
sick
chamber
.
<EOS>
By
evening
she
seemed
greatly
exhausted
;
yet
no
arguments
could
persuade
her
to
return
to
that
apartment
,
and
I
had
to
arrange
the
parlour
sofa
for
her
bed
,
till
another
room
could
be
prepared
.
<EOS>
To
obviate
the
fatigue
of
mounting
and
descending
the
stairs
,
we
fitted
up
this
,
where
you
lie
at
present
 
on
the
same
floor
with
the
parlour
;
and
she
was
soon
strong
enough
to
move
from
one
to
the
other
,
leaning
on
Edgar
's
arm
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
I
thought
myself
,
she
might
recover
,
so
waited
on
as
she
was
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
double
cause
to
desire
it
,
for
on
her
existence
depended
that
of
another
:
we
cherished
the
hope
that
in
a
little
while
Mr.
Linton
's
heart
would
be
gladdened
,
and
his
lands
secured
from
a
stranger
's
gripe
,
by
the
birth
of
an
heir
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
mention
that
Isabella
sent
to
her
brother
,
some
six
weeks
from
her
departure
,
a
short
note
,
announcing
her
marriage
with
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
dry
and
cold
;
but
at
the
bottom
was
dotted
in
with
pencil
an
obscure
apology
,
and
an
entreaty
for
kind
remembrance
and
reconciliation
,
if
her
proceeding
had
offended
him
:
asserting
that
she
could
not
help
it
then
,
and
being
done
,
she
had
now
no
power
to
repeal
it
.
<EOS>
Linton
did
not
reply
to
this
,
I
believe
;
and
,
in
a
fortnight
more
,
I
got
a
long
letter
,
which
I
considered
odd
,
coming
from
the
pen
of
a
bride
just
out
of
the
honeymoon
.
<EOS>
I
'll
read
it
:
for
I
keep
it
yet
.
<EOS>
Any
relic
of
the
dead
is
precious
,
if
they
were
valued
living
.
     
<EOS>
DEAR
ELLEN
,
it
begins
,
 
<EOS>
I
came
last
night
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
and
heard
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
Catherine
has
been
,
and
is
yet
,
very
ill
.
<EOS>
I
must
not
write
to
her
,
I
suppose
,
and
my
brother
is
either
too
angry
or
too
distressed
to
answer
what
I
sent
him
.
<EOS>
Still
,
I
must
write
to
somebody
,
and
the
only
choice
left
me
is
you
.
  
<EOS>
Inform
Edgar
that
I
'd
give
the
world
to
see
his
face
again
 
that
my
heart
returned
to
Thrushcross
Grange
in
twenty
-
four
hours
after
I
left
it
,
and
is
there
at
this
moment
,
full
of
warm
feelings
for
him
,
and
Catherine
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
follow
it
though
_
 
<EOS>
(
these
words
are
underlined
)
 
<EOS>
they
need
not
expect
me
,
and
they
may
draw
what
conclusions
they
please
;
taking
care
,
however
,
to
lay
nothing
at
the
door
of
my
weak
will
or
deficient
affection
.
  
<EOS>
The
remainder
of
the
letter
is
for
yourself
alone
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
ask
you
two
questions
:
the
first
is
,
 
How
did
you
contrive
to
preserve
the
common
sympathies
of
human
nature
when
you
resided
here
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
recognise
any
sentiment
which
those
around
share
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
second
question
I
have
great
interest
in
<EOS>
;
it
is
this
 
Is
Mr.
Heathcliff
a
man
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
is
he
mad
?
<EOS>
And
if
not
,
is
he
a
devil
?
<EOS>
I
sha'n't
tell
my
reasons
for
making
this
inquiry
;
but
I
beseech
you
to
explain
,
if
you
can
,
what
I
have
married
:
that
is
,
when
you
call
to
see
me
;
and
you
must
call
,
Ellen
,
very
soon
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
write
,
but
come
,
and
bring
me
something
from
Edgar
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
you
shall
hear
how
I
have
been
received
in
my
new
home
,
as
I
am
led
to
imagine
the
Heights
will
be
.
<EOS>
It
is
to
amuse
myself
that
I
dwell
on
such
subjects
as
the
lack
of
external
comforts
:
they
never
occupy
my
thoughts
,
except
at
the
moment
when
I
miss
them
.
<EOS>
I
should
laugh
and
dance
for
joy
,
if
I
found
their
absence
was
the
total
of
my
miseries
,
and
the
rest
was
an
unnatural
dream
!
  
<EOS>
The
sun
set
behind
the
Grange
as
we
turned
on
to
the
moors
;
by
that
,
I
judged
it
to
be
six
o'clock
;
and
my
companion
halted
half
an
hour
,
to
inspect
the
park
,
and
the
gardens
,
and
,
probably
,
the
place
itself
,
as
well
as
he
could
;
so
it
was
dark
when
we
dismounted
in
the
paved
yard
of
the
farm
-
house
,
and
your
old
fellow
-
servant
,
Joseph
,
issued
out
to
receive
us
by
the
light
of
a
dip
candle
.
<EOS>
He
did
it
with
a
courtesy
that
redounded
to
his
credit
.
<EOS>
His
first
act
was
to
elevate
his
torch
to
a
level
with
my
face
,
squint
malignantly
,
project
his
under
-
lip
,
and
turn
away
.
<EOS>
Then
he
took
the
two
horses
,
and
led
them
into
the
stables
;
reappearing
for
the
purpose
of
locking
the
outer
gate
,
as
if
we
lived
in
an
ancient
castle
.
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
stayed
to
speak
to
him
,
and
I
entered
the
kitchen
 
<EOS>
a
dingy
,
untidy
hole
<EOS>
;
I
daresay
you
would
not
know
it
,
it
is
so
changed
since
it
was
in
your
charge
.
<EOS>
By
the
fire
stood
a
ruffianly
child
,
strong
in
limb
and
dirty
in
garb
,
with
a
look
of
Catherine
in
his
eyes
and
about
his
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
Edgar
's
legal
nephew
,
"
I
reflected
 
"
mine
in
a
manner
;
I
must
shake
hands
,
and
 
yes
 
I
must
kiss
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
right
to
establish
a
good
understanding
at
the
beginning
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
approached
,
and
,
attempting
to
take
his
chubby
fist
,
said
 
"
How
do
you
do
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
replied
in
a
jargon
I
did
not
comprehend
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
and
I
be
friends
,
Hareton
?
<EOS>
"
was
my
next
essay
at
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
An
oath
,
and
a
threat
to
set
Throttler
on
me
if
I
did
not
"
frame
off
"
rewarded
my
perseverance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hey
,
Throttler
,
lad
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
the
little
wretch
,
rousing
a
half
-
bred
bull
-
dog
from
its
lair
in
a
corner
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
wilt
thou
be
ganging
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
authoritatively
.
  
<EOS>
Love
for
my
life
urged
a
compliance
;
I
stepped
over
the
threshold
to
wait
till
the
others
should
enter
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
was
nowhere
visible
;
and
Joseph
,
whom
I
followed
to
the
stables
,
and
requested
to
accompany
me
in
,
after
staring
and
muttering
to
himself
,
screwed
up
his
nose
and
replied
 
"
Mim
!
mim
!
<EOS>
mim
!
<EOS>
Did
iver
Christian
body
hear
aught
like
it
?
<EOS>
Mincing
un
'
munching
!
<EOS>
How
can
I
tell
whet
ye
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
I
wish
you
to
come
with
me
into
the
house
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
,
thinking
him
deaf
,
yet
highly
disgusted
at
his
rudeness
.
  
<EOS>
"
None
<EOS>
o
'
me
!
<EOS>
I
getten
summut
else
to
do
,
"
he
answered
,
and
continued
his
work
;
moving
his
lantern
jaws
meanwhile
,
and
surveying
my
dress
and
countenance
(
the
former
a
great
deal
too
fine
,
but
the
latter
,
I
'm
sure
,
as
sad
as
he
could
desire
)
with
sovereign
contempt
.
  
<EOS>
I
walked
round
the
yard
,
and
through
a
wicket
,
to
another
door
,
at
which
I
took
the
liberty
of
knocking
,
<EOS>
in
hopes
some
more
civil
servant
might
show
himself
.
<EOS>
After
a
short
suspense
,
it
was
opened
by
a
tall
,
gaunt
man
,
without
neckerchief
,
and
otherwise
extremely
slovenly
;
his
features
were
lost
in
masses
of
shaggy
hair
that
hung
on
his
shoulders
;
and
_
his
_
eyes
,
too
,
were
like
a
ghostly
Catherine
's
with
all
their
beauty
annihilated
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
your
business
here
?
<EOS>
"
he
demanded
,
grimly
.
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
name
was
Isabella
Linton
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
seen
me
before
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
'm
lately
married
to
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
and
he
has
brought
me
here
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
by
your
permission
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
come
back
,
then
?
"
asked
the
hermit
,
glaring
like
a
hungry
wolf
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
we
came
just
now
,
"
I
said
;
"
but
he
left
me
by
the
kitchen
door
;
and
when
I
would
have
gone
in
,
your
little
boy
played
sentinel
over
the
place
,
and
frightened
me
off
by
the
help
of
a
bull
-
dog
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
well
<EOS>
the
hellish
villain
has
kept
his
word
!
"
<EOS>
growled
my
future
host
,
searching
the
darkness
beyond
me
in
expectation
of
discovering
Heathcliff
;
and
then
he
indulged
in
a
soliloquy
of
execrations
,
and
threats
of
what
he
would
have
done
had
the
"
fiend
"
deceived
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
repented
having
tried
this
second
entrance
,
and
was
almost
inclined
to
slip
away
before
he
finished
cursing
,
but
ere
<EOS>
I
could
execute
that
intention
,
he
ordered
me
in
,
and
shut
and
re
-
fastened
the
door
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
fire
,
and
that
was
all
the
light
in
the
huge
apartment
,
whose
floor
had
grown
a
uniform
grey
;
and
the
once
brilliant
pewter
-
dishes
,
which
used
to
attract
my
gaze
when
I
was
a
girl
,
partook
of
a
similar
obscurity
,
created
by
tarnish
and
dust
.
<EOS>
I
inquired
whether
I
might
call
the
maid
,
and
be
conducted
to
a
bedroom
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Earnshaw
vouchsafed
no
answer
.
<EOS>
He
walked
up
and
down
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
apparently
quite
forgetting
my
presence
;
and
his
abstraction
was
evidently
so
deep
,
and
his
whole
aspect
so
misanthropical
,
that
I
shrank
from
disturbing
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
You
'll
not
be
surprised
,
Ellen
,
at
my
feeling
particularly
cheerless
,
seated
in
worse
than
solitude
on
that
inhospitable
hearth
,
and
remembering
that
four
miles
distant
lay
my
delightful
home
,
containing
the
only
people
I
loved
on
earth
;
and
there
might
as
well
be
the
Atlantic
to
part
us
,
instead
of
those
four
miles
<EOS>
:
I
could
not
overpass
them
!
<EOS>
I
questioned
with
myself
 
where
must
I
turn
for
comfort
?
<EOS>
and
 
mind
you
do
n't
tell
Edgar
,
or
Catherine
 
above
every
sorrow
beside
,
this
rose
pre
-
eminent
:
despair
at
finding
nobody
who
could
or
would
be
my
ally
against
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
I
had
sought
shelter
at
Wuthering
Heights
,
almost
gladly
,
because
I
was
secured
by
that
arrangement
from
living
alone
with
him
;
but
he
knew
the
people
we
were
coming
amongst
,
and
he
did
not
fear
their
intermeddling
.
  
<EOS>
I
sat
and
thought
a
doleful
time
:
the
clock
struck
eight
,
and
nine
,
and
still
my
companion
paced
to
and
fro
,
his
head
bent
on
his
breast
,
and
perfectly
silent
,
unless
a
groan
or
a
bitter
ejaculation
forced
itself
out
at
intervals
.
<EOS>
I
listened
to
detect
a
woman
's
voice
in
the
house
,
and
filled
the
interim
with
wild
regrets
and
dismal
anticipations
,
which
,
at
last
,
spoke
audibly
in
irrepressible
sighing
and
weeping
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
aware
how
openly
I
grieved
,
till
Earnshaw
halted
opposite
,
in
his
measured
walk
,
and
gave
me
a
stare
of
newly
-
awakened
surprise
.
<EOS>
Taking
advantage
of
his
recovered
attention
,
I
exclaimed
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
tired
with
my
journey
,
and
I
want
to
go
to
bed
!
<EOS>
Where
is
the
maid
-
servant
?
<EOS>
Direct
me
to
her
,
as
she
wo
n't
come
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
none
,
"
he
answered
;
"
you
must
wait
on
yourself
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
must
I
sleep
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
sobbed
;
I
was
beyond
regarding
self
-
respect
,
weighed
down
by
fatigue
and
wretchedness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Joseph
will
show
you
Heathcliff
's
chamber
,
"
said
he
;
"
open
that
door
 
<EOS>
he
's
in
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
obey
,
but
he
suddenly
arrested
me
,
and
added
in
the
strangest
tone
 
<EOS>
"
Be
so
good
as
to
turn
your
lock
,
and
draw
your
bolt
 
do
n't
omit
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
why
,
Mr.
Earnshaw
?
"
I
did
not
relish
the
notion
of
deliberately
fastening
myself
in
with
Heathcliff
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
,
pulling
from
his
waistcoat
a
curiously
-
constructed
pistol
,
having
a
double
-
edged
spring
knife
attached
to
the
barrel
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
great
tempter
to
a
desperate
man
,
is
it
not
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
resist
going
up
with
this
every
night
,
and
trying
his
door
.
<EOS>
If
once
I
find
it
open
<EOS>
he
's
done
for
<EOS>
;
I
do
it
invariably
,
even
though
the
minute
before
I
have
been
recalling
a
hundred
reasons
that
should
make
me
refrain
:
it
is
some
devil
that
urges
me
to
thwart
my
own
schemes
by
killing
him
.
<EOS>
You
fight
against
that
devil
for
love
as
long
as
you
may
;
when
the
time
comes
,
not
all
the
angels
in
heaven
shall
save
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
surveyed
the
weapon
inquisitively
.
<EOS>
A
hideous
notion
struck
me
:
how
powerful
I
should
be
possessing
such
an
instrument
!
<EOS>
I
took
it
from
his
hand
,
and
touched
the
blade
.
<EOS>
He
looked
astonished
at
the
expression
my
face
assumed
during
a
brief
second
:
it
was
not
horror
,
it
was
covetousness
.
<EOS>
He
snatched
the
pistol
back
,
jealously
;
shut
the
knife
,
and
returned
it
to
its
concealment
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
if
you
tell
him
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
Put
him
on
his
guard
,
and
watch
for
him
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
terms
we
are
on
<EOS>
,
I
see
:
his
danger
does
not
shock
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
has
Heathcliff
done
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
"
<EOS>
In
what
has
he
wronged
you
,
to
warrant
this
appalling
hatred
?
<EOS>
Would
n't
it
be
wiser
to
bid
him
quit
the
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
thundered
Earnshaw
;
"
<EOS>
should
he
offer
to
leave
me
,
he
's
a
dead
man
:
persuade
him
to
attempt
it
,
and
you
are
a
murderess
!
<EOS>
Am
I
to
lose
_
all
_
,
without
a
chance
of
retrieval
?
<EOS>
Is
Hareton
to
be
a
beggar
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
damnation
!
<EOS>
I
_
will
_
have
it
back
;
and
I
'll
have
_
<EOS>
his
_
gold
too
;
and
then
his
blood
;
and
hell
shall
have
his
soul
!
<EOS>
It
will
be
ten
times
blacker
with
that
guest
than
ever
<EOS>
it
was
before
!
"
  
<EOS>
You
've
acquainted
me
,
Ellen
,
with
your
old
master
's
habits
.
<EOS>
He
is
clearly
on
the
verge
of
madness
:
he
was
so
last
night
at
least
.
<EOS>
I
shuddered
to
be
near
him
,
and
thought
on
the
servant
's
ill
-
bred
moroseness
as
comparatively
agreeable
.
<EOS>
He
now
recommenced
his
moody
walk
,
and
I
raised
the
latch
,
and
escaped
into
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
Joseph
was
bending
over
the
fire
,
peering
into
a
large
pan
that
swung
above
it
;
and
a
wooden
bowl
of
oatmeal
stood
on
the
settle
close
by
.
<EOS>
The
contents
of
the
pan
began
to
boil
,
and
he
turned
to
plunge
his
hand
into
the
bowl
;
I
conjectured
that
this
preparation
was
probably
for
our
supper
,
and
,
being
hungry
<EOS>
,
I
resolved
it
should
be
eatable
;
so
,
crying
out
sharply
,
"
_
<EOS>
I
'll
_
make
the
porridge
!
<EOS>
"
I
removed
the
vessel
out
of
his
reach
,
and
proceeded
to
take
off
my
hat
and
riding
-
habit
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Earnshaw
,
"
I
continued
,
"
directs
me
to
wait
on
myself
:
I
will
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
going
to
act
the
lady
among
you
,
for
fear
I
should
starve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gooid
Lord
!
"
<EOS>
he
muttered
,
sitting
down
,
and
stroking
his
ribbed
stockings
from
the
knee
to
the
ankle
.
<EOS>
"
If
there
's
to
be
fresh
ortherings
 
<EOS>
just
when
I
getten
used
to
two
maisters
,
<EOS>
if
I
mun
hev
'
a
_
mistress
_
set
o'er
my
heead
,
it
's
like
time
to
be
flitting
.
<EOS>
I
niver
_
<EOS>
did
_
think
to
see
t
'
day
that
I
mud
lave
th
'
 
owld
place
 
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
it
's
nigh
at
hand
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
lamentation
drew
no
notice
from
me
:
I
went
briskly
to
work
,
sighing
to
remember
a
period
when
it
would
have
been
all
merry
fun
;
but
compelled
speedily
to
drive
off
the
remembrance
.
<EOS>
It
racked
me
to
recall
past
happiness
and
the
greater
peril
<EOS>
there
was
of
conjuring
up
its
apparition
,
the
quicker
the
thible
ran
round
,
and
the
faster
the
handfuls
of
meal
fell
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
Joseph
beheld
my
style
of
cookery
with
growing
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thear
!
"
<EOS>
he
ejaculated
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hareton
,

<EOS>
It

"
  
<EOS>
It
_
was
_
rather
a
rough
mess
,
<EOS>
I
own
,
when
poured
into
the
basins
;
four
had
been
provided
,
and
a
gallon
pitcher
of
new
milk
was
brought
from
the
dairy
,
which
Hareton
seized
and
commenced
drinking
and
spilling
from
the
expansive
lip
.
<EOS>
I
expostulated
,
and
desired
that
he
should
have
his
in
a
mug
;
affirming
that
I
could
not
taste
the
liquid
treated
so
dirtily
.
<EOS>
The
old
cynic
chose
to
be
vastly
offended
at
this
nicety
;
assuring
me
,
repeatedly
,
that
"
the
barn
was
every
bit
as
good
"
as
I
,
"
and
every
bit
as
wollsome
,
"
and
wondering
how
I
could
fashion
to
be
so
conceited
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
infant
ruffian
continued
sucking
;
and
glowered
up
at
me
defyingly
,
as
he
slavered
into
the
jug
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
my
supper
in
another
room
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Have
you
no
place
you
call
a
parlour
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
_
Parlour
_
!
"
<EOS>
he
echoed
,
sneeringly
,
"
<EOS>
_
parlour
_
!
<EOS>
Nay

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
shall
go
up
-
stairs
,
"
I
answered
;
"
show
me
a
chamber
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
put
my
basin
on
a
tray
,
and
went
myself
to
fetch
some
more
milk
.
<EOS>
With
great
grumblings
,
the
fellow
rose
,
and
preceded
me
in
my
ascent
<EOS>
:
we
mounted
to
the
garrets
;
he
opened
a
door
,
now
and
then
,
to
look
into
the
apartments
we
passed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
rahm
,
"
he
said
,
at
last
,
flinging
back
a
cranky
board
on
hinges
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
weel
eneugh
to
ate
a
few
porridge
in
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
pack
o

"
  
<EOS>
The
"
rahm
"
was
a
kind
of
lumber
-
hole
smelling
strong
of
malt
and
grain
;
various
sacks
of
which
articles
were
piled
around
,
leaving
a
wide
,
bare
space
in
the
middle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
man
,
"
I
exclaimed
,
facing
him
angrily
,
"
this
is
not
a
place
to
sleep
in
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
see
my
bed

room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
Bed

"
<EOS>
he
repeated
,
in
a
tone
of
mockery
.
<EOS>
"
Yah

"
  
<EOS>
He
pointed
into
the
second
garret
,
only
differing
from
the
first
in
being
more
naked
about
the
walls
,
and
having
a
large
,
low
,
curtainless
bed
,
with
an
indigo
-
coloured
quilt
,
at
one
end
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
I
want
with
yours
?
<EOS>
"
I
retorted
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
Mr.
Heathcliff
does
not
lodge
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
does
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh

Maister
_
Hathecliff

"
<EOS>
cried
he
,
as
if
making
a
new
discovery
.
"
<EOS>
Could

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
a
nice
house
,
Joseph
,
"
I
could
not
refrain
from
observing
,
"
and
pleasant
inmates
;
and
I
think
the
concentrated
essence
of
all
the
madness
in
the
world
took
up
its
abode
in
my
brain
the
day
I
linked
my
fate
with
theirs
!
<EOS>
However
,
that
is
not
to
the
present
purpose
 
there
are
other
rooms
.
<EOS>
For
heaven
's
sake
be
quick
,
and
let
me
settle
somewhere
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
made
no
reply
to
this
adjuration
;
only
plodding
doggedly
down
the
wooden
steps
,
and
halting
,
before
an
apartment
which
,
from
that
halt
and
the
superior
quality
of
its
furniture
,
I
conjectured
to
be
the
best
one
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
carpet
 
<EOS>
a
good
one
,
but
the
pattern
was
obliterated
by
dust
;
a
fireplace
hung
with
cut
-
paper
,
dropping
to
pieces
;
a
handsome
oak
-
bedstead
with
ample
crimson
curtains
of
rather
expensive
material
and
modern
make
;
<EOS>
but
they
had
evidently
experienced
rough
usage
:
the
vallances
hung
in
festoons
,
wrenched
from
their
rings
,
and
the
iron
rod
supporting
them
was
bent
in
an
arc
on
one
side
,
causing
the
drapery
to
trail
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
The
chairs
were
also
damaged
,
many
of
them
severely
;
and
deep
indentations
deformed
the
panels
of
the
walls
.
<EOS>
I
was
endeavouring
to
gather
resolution
for
entering
and
taking
possession
,
when
my
fool
of
a
guide
announced
,
 
"
This
here
is
t
'
maister
's
.
<EOS>
"
My
supper
by
this
time
was
cold
,
my
appetite
gone
,
and
my
patience
exhausted
.
<EOS>
I
insisted
on
being
provided
instantly
with
a
place
of
refuge
,
and
means
of
repose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whear
the
divil
?
<EOS>
"
began
the
religious
elder
.
"
<EOS>
The
Lord
bless

!
<EOS>
The

<EOS>
Whear

<EOS>

<EOS>
i
'

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
so
vexed
<EOS>
,
I
flung
my
tray
and
its
contents
on
the
ground
;
and
then
seated
myself
at
the
stairs'-head
,
hid
my
face
in
my
hands
,
and
cried
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ech
!

<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Joseph
.
<EOS>
"
Weel

<EOS>

<EOS>
I
nobbut

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
he
went
on
scolding
to
his
den
beneath
,
taking
the
candle
with
him
;
and
I
remained
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
The
period
of
reflection
succeeding
this
silly
action
compelled
me
to
admit
the
necessity
of
smothering
my
pride
and
choking
my
wrath
,
and
bestirring
myself
to
remove
its
effects
.
<EOS>
An
unexpected
aid
presently
appeared
in
the
shape
of
Throttler
,
whom
I
now
recognised
as
a
son
of
our
old
Skulker
:
it
had
spent
its
whelphood
at
the
Grange
,
and
was
given
by
my
father
to
Mr.
Hindley
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
it
knew
me
:
it
pushed
its
nose
against
mine
by
way
of
salute
,
and
then
hastened
to
devour
the
porridge
;
while
I
groped
from
step
to
step
,
collecting
the
shattered
earthenware
,
and
drying
the
spatters
of
milk
from
the
banister
with
my
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
Our
labours
were
scarcely
over
when
I
heard
Earnshaw
's
tread
in
the
passage
;
my
assistant
tucked
in
his
tail
,
and
pressed
to
the
wall
;
I
stole
into
the
nearest
doorway
.
<EOS>
The
dog
's
endeavour
to
avoid
him
was
unsuccessful
;
as
I
guessed
by
a
scutter
down
-
stairs
,
and
a
prolonged
,
piteous
yelping
.
<EOS>
I
had
better
luck
:
he
passed
on
,
entered
his
chamber
,
and
shut
the
door
.
<EOS>
Directly
after
Joseph
came
up
with
Hareton
,
to
put
him
to
bed
.
<EOS>
I
had
found
shelter
in
Hareton
's
room
,
and
the
old
man
,
on
seeing
me
,
said
,
 
"
They
's
rahm
for
<EOS>
boath
ye
un
'
yer
pride
<EOS>
,
now
,
I
sud
think

<EOS>
It

'
<EOS>
Him
as
allus
maks
a
third
,
i
'
sich
ill
company
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gladly
did
I
take
advantage
of
this
intimation
;
and
the
minute
I
flung
myself
into
a
chair
,
by
the
fire
,
I
nodded
,
and
slept
.
<EOS>
My
slumber
was
deep
and
sweet
,
though
over
far
too
soon
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
awoke
me
;
he
had
just
come
in
,
and
demanded
,
in
his
loving
manner
,
what
I
was
doing
there
?
<EOS>
I
told
him
the
cause
of
my
staying
up
<EOS>
so
late
 
that
he
had
the
key
of
our
room
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
The
adjective
<EOS>
_
our
_
gave
mortal
offence
.
<EOS>
He
swore
it
was
not
,
nor
ever
should
be
,
mine
;
and
he
'd
 
<EOS>
but
I
'll
not
repeat
his
language
,
nor
describe
his
habitual
conduct
:
he
is
ingenious
and
unresting
in
seeking
to
gain
my
abhorrence
!
<EOS>
I
sometimes
wonder
at
him
with
an
intensity
that
deadens
my
fear
:
<EOS>
yet
,
I
assure
you
,
a
tiger
or
a
venomous
serpent
could
not
rouse
terror
in
me
equal
to
that
which
he
wakens
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
of
Catherine
's
illness
,
and
accused
my
brother
of
causing
it
promising
that
I
should
be
Edgar
's
proxy
in
suffering
,
till
he
could
get
hold
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
hate
him
 
<EOS>
I
am
wretched
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
a
fool
!
<EOS>
Beware
of
uttering
one
breath
of
this
to
any
one
at
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
I
shall
expect
you
every
day
 
do
n't
disappoint
me
!
 
<EOS>
ISABELLA
.
    
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
had
perused
this
epistle
<EOS>
I
went
to
the
master
,
and
informed
him
that
his
sister
had
arrived
at
the
Heights
,
and
sent
me
a
letter
expressing
her
sorrow
for
Mrs.
Linton
's
situation
,
and
her
ardent
desire
to
see
him
;
with
a
wish
that
he
would
transmit
to
her
,
as
early
as
possible
,
some
token
of
forgiveness
by
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Forgiveness
!
"
said
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
forgive
her
,
Ellen
.
<EOS>
You
may
call
at
Wuthering
Heights
this
afternoon
,
if
you
like
,
and
say
that
I
am
not
angry
,
but
I
'm
sorry
to
have
lost
her
;
especially
as
I
can
never
think
she
'll
be
happy
.
<EOS>
It
is
out
of
the
question
my
going
to
see
her
,
however
:
we
are
eternally
divided
;
and
should
she
really
wish
to
oblige
me
,
let
her
persuade
the
villain
she
has
married
to
leave
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
wo
n't
write
her
a
little
note
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
imploringly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
needless
.
<EOS>
My
communication
with
Heathcliff
's
family
shall
be
as
sparing
as
his
with
mine
.
<EOS>
It
shall
not
exist
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Edgar
's
coldness
depressed
me
exceedingly
;
and
all
the
way
from
the
Grange
I
puzzled
my
brains
how
to
put
more
heart
into
what
he
said
,
when
I
repeated
it
;
and
how
to
soften
his
refusal
of
even
a
few
lines
to
console
Isabella
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
she
had
been
on
the
watch
for
me
since
morning
:
<EOS>
I
saw
her
looking
through
the
lattice
as
I
came
up
the
garden
causeway
,
and
I
nodded
to
her
;
but
she
drew
back
,
as
if
afraid
of
being
observed
.
<EOS>
I
entered
without
knocking
.
<EOS>
There
never
was
such
a
dreary
,
dismal
scene
as
the
formerly
cheerful
house
presented
!
<EOS>
I
must
confess
,
that
if
I
had
been
in
the
young
lady
's
place
,
I
would
,
at
least
,
have
swept
the
hearth
,
and
wiped
the
tables
with
a
duster
.
<EOS>
But
she
already
partook
of
the
pervading
spirit
of
neglect
which
encompassed
her
.
<EOS>
Her
pretty
face
was
wan
and
listless
;
her
hair
uncurled
:
<EOS>
some
locks
hanging
lankly
down
,
and
some
carelessly
twisted
round
her
head
.
<EOS>
Probably
she
had
not
touched
her
dress
since
yester
evening
.
<EOS>
Hindley
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
sat
at
a
table
,
turning
over
some
papers
in
his
pocket
-
book
;
but
he
rose
when
I
appeared
,
asked
me
how
I
did
,
quite
friendly
,
and
offered
me
a
chair
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
only
thing
there
that
seemed
decent
;
and
I
thought
he
never
looked
better
.
<EOS>
So
much
had
circumstances
altered
their
positions
,
that
he
would
certainly
have
struck
a
stranger
as
a
born
and
bred
gentleman
;
and
his
wife
as
a
thorough
little
slattern
!
<EOS>
She
came
forward
eagerly
to
greet
me
,
and
held
out
one
hand
to
take
the
expected
letter
.
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
.
<EOS>
She
would
n't
understand
the
hint
,
but
followed
me
to
a
sideboard
,
where
I
went
to
lay
my
bonnet
,
and
importuned
me
in
a
whisper
to
give
her
directly
what
I
had
brought
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
guessed
the
meaning
of
her
manoeuvres
,
and
said
 
"
If
you
have
got
anything
for
Isabella
(
as
no
doubt
you
have
,
Nelly
)
,
give
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
You
need
n't
make
a
secret
of
it
:
we
have
no
secrets
between
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
have
nothing
,
"
I
replied
,
thinking
it
best
to
speak
the
truth
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
My
master
bid
me
tell
his
sister
that
she
must
not
expect
either
a
letter
or
a
visit
from
him
at
present
.
<EOS>
He
sends
his
love
,
ma'am
,
and
his
wishes
for
your
happiness
,
and
his
pardon
for
the
grief
you
have
occasioned
;
but
he
thinks
that
after
this
time
his
household
and
the
household
here
should
drop
intercommunication
,
as
nothing
could
come
of
keeping
it
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Heathcliff
's
lip
quivered
slightly
,
and
she
returned
to
her
seat
in
the
window
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
took
his
stand
on
the
hearthstone
,
near
me
,
and
began
to
put
questions
concerning
Catherine
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
as
much
as
I
thought
proper
of
her
illness
,
and
he
extorted
from
me
,
by
cross
-
examination
,
most
of
the
facts
connected
with
its
origin
.
<EOS>
I
blamed
her
,
as
she
deserved
,
for
bringing
it
all
on
herself
;
and
ended
by
hoping
that
he
would
follow
Mr.
Linton
's
example
and
avoid
future
interference
with
his
family
,
for
good
or
evil
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Linton
is
now
just
recovering
,
"
I
said
;
"
she
'll
never
be
like
she
was
,
but
her
life
is
spared
;
and
if
you
really
have
a
regard
for
her
,
you
'll
shun
crossing
her
way
again
:
<EOS>
nay
,
you
'll
move
out
of
this
country
entirely
;
and
that
you
may
not
regret
it
,
I
'll
inform
you
Catherine
Linton
is
as
different
now
from
your
old
friend
Catherine
Earnshaw
,
as
that
young
lady
is
different
from
me
.
<EOS>
Her
appearance
is
changed
greatly
,
her
character
much
more
so
;
and
the
person
who
is
compelled
,
of
necessity
,
to
be
her
companion
,
will
only
sustain
his
affection
hereafter
by
the
remembrance
of
what
she
once
was
,
by
common
humanity
,
and
a
sense
of
duty
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
quite
possible
,
"
remarked
Heathcliff
,
forcing
himself
to
seem
calm
:
"
quite
possible
that
your
master
should
have
nothing
but
common
humanity
and
a
sense
of
duty
to
fall
back
upon
.
<EOS>
But
do
you
imagine
that
I
shall
leave
Catherine
to
his
_
duty
_
and
_
humanity
_
?
<EOS>
and
can
you
compare
my
feelings
respecting
Catherine
to
his
?
<EOS>
Before
you
leave
this
house
,
I
must
exact
a
promise
from
you
that
you
'll
get
me
an
interview
with
her
:
consent
,
or
refuse
,
I
_
will
_
see
her
!
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
"
I
replied
,
"
you
must
not
:
you
never
shall
,
through
my
means
.
<EOS>
Another
encounter
between
you
and
the
master
would
kill
her
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
With
your
aid
that
may
be
avoided
,
"
he
continued
;
"
and
should
there
be
danger
of
such
an
event
 
<EOS>
should
he
be
the
cause
of
adding
a
single
trouble
more
to
her
existence
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
think
I
shall
be
justified
in
going
to
extremes
!
<EOS>
I
wish
you
had
sincerity
enough
to
tell
me
whether
Catherine
would
suffer
greatly
from
his
loss
:
the
fear
that
she
would
restrains
me
.
<EOS>
And
there
you
see
the
distinction
between
our
feelings
:
had
he
been
in
my
place
,
and
I
in
his
,
though
I
hated
him
with
a
hatred
that
turned
my
life
to
gall
<EOS>
,
I
never
would
have
raised
a
hand
against
him
.
<EOS>
You
may
look
incredulous
,
if
you
please
!
<EOS>
I
never
would
have
banished
him
from
her
society
as
long
as
she
desired
his
.
<EOS>
The
moment
her
regard
ceased
,
I
would
have
torn
his
heart
out
,
and
drunk
his
blood
!
<EOS>
But
,
till
then
 
if
you
do
n't
believe
me
,
you
do
n't
know
me
 
till
then
<EOS>
,
I
would
have
died
by
inches
before
I
touched
a
single
hair
of
his
head
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
"
I
interrupted
,
"
you
have
no
scruples
in
completely
ruining
all
hopes
of
her
perfect
restoration
,
by
thrusting
yourself
into
her
remembrance
now
,
when
she
has
nearly
forgotten
you
,
and
involving
her
in
a
new
tumult
of
discord
and
distress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
suppose
she
has
nearly
forgotten
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Nelly
!
<EOS>
you
know
she
has
not
!
<EOS>
You
know
as
well
as
I
do
,
that
for
every
thought
she
spends
on
Linton
she
spends
a
thousand
on
me
!
<EOS>
At
a
most
miserable
period
of
my
life
,
I
had
a
notion
of
the
kind
:
it
haunted
me
on
my
return
to
the
neighbourhood
last
summer
;
but
only
her
own
assurance
could
make
me
admit
the
horrible
idea
again
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
Linton
would
be
nothing
,
nor
Hindley
,
nor
all
the
dreams
that
ever
I
dreamt
.
<EOS>
Two
words
would
comprehend
my
future
 
_
death
_
and
_
hell
<EOS>
_
:
<EOS>
existence
,
after
losing
her
,
would
be
hell
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
was
a
fool
to
fancy
for
a
moment
that
she
valued
Edgar
Linton
's
attachment
more
than
mine
.
<EOS>
If
he
loved
with
all
the
powers
of
his
puny
being
,
he
could
n't
love
as
much
in
eighty
years
as
I
could
in
a
day
.
<EOS>
And
Catherine
has
a
heart
as
deep
as
I
have
:
the
sea
could
be
as
readily
contained
in
that
horse
-
trough
as
her
whole
affection
be
monopolised
by
him
.
<EOS>
Tush
!
<EOS>
He
is
scarcely
a
degree
dearer
to
her
than
her
dog
,
or
her
horse
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
in
him
to
be
loved
like
me
:
how
can
she
love
in
him
what
he
has
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Catherine
and
Edgar
are
as
fond
of
each
other
as
any
two
people
can
be
,
"
cried
Isabella
,
with
sudden
vivacity
.
<EOS>
"
No
one
has
a
right
to
talk
in
that
manner
,
and
I
wo
n't
hear
my
brother
depreciated
in
silence
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
brother
is
wondrous
fond
of
you
too
,
is
n't
he
?
"
<EOS>
observed
Heathcliff
,
scornfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
turns
you
adrift
on
the
world
with
surprising
alacrity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
aware
of
what
I
suffer
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
tell
him
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
telling
him
something
,
then
:
you
have
written
,
have
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
say
that
I
was
married
,
I
did
write
 
you
saw
the
note
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
nothing
since
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
young
lady
is
looking
sadly
the
worse
for
her
change
of
condition
,
"
I
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
Somebody
's
love
comes
short
in
her
case
,
obviously
;
whose
,
I
may
guess
;
but
,
perhaps
,
I
should
n't
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
should
guess
it
was
her
own
,
"
said
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
She
degenerates
into
a
mere
slut
!
<EOS>
She
is
tired
of
trying
to
please
me
uncommonly
early
.
<EOS>
You
'd
hardly
credit
it
,
but
the
very
morrow
of
our
wedding
she
was
weeping
to
go
home
.
<EOS>
However
,
she
'll
suit
this
house
so
much
the
better
for
not
being
over
nice
,
and
I
'll
take
care
<EOS>
she
does
not
disgrace
me
by
rambling
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
returned
I
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
you
'll
consider
that
Mrs.
Heathcliff
is
accustomed
to
be
looked
after
and
waited
on
;
and
that
she
has
been
brought
up
like
an
only
daughter
,
whom
every
one
was
ready
to
serve
.
<EOS>
You
must
let
her
have
a
maid
to
keep
things
tidy
about
her
,
and
you
must
treat
her
kindly
.
<EOS>
Whatever
be
your
notion
of
Mr.
Edgar
,
you
can
not
doubt
that
she
has
a
capacity
for
strong
attachments
,
or
she
would
n't
have
abandoned
the
elegancies
,
and
comforts
,
and
friends
of
her
former
home
,
to
fix
contentedly
,
in
such
a
wilderness
as
this
,
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
abandoned
them
under
a
delusion
,
"
he
answered
;
"
picturing
in
me
a
hero
of
romance
,
and
expecting
unlimited
indulgences
from
my
chivalrous
devotion
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
regard
her
in
the
light
of
a
rational
creature
,
so
obstinately
has
she
persisted
in
forming
a
fabulous
notion
of
my
character
and
acting
on
the
false
impressions
she
cherished
.
<EOS>
But
,
at
last
,
I
think
she
begins
to
know
me
:
I
do
n't
perceive
the
silly
smiles
and
grimaces
that
provoked
me
at
first
;
and
the
senseless
incapability
of
discerning
that
I
was
in
earnest
when
I
gave
her
my
opinion
of
her
infatuation
and
herself
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
marvellous
effort
of
perspicacity
to
discover
that
I
did
not
love
her
.
<EOS>
I
believed
,
at
one
time
,
no
lessons
could
teach
her
that
!
<EOS>
And
yet
it
is
poorly
learnt
;
for
this
morning
she
announced
,
as
a
piece
of
appalling
intelligence
,
that
I
had
actually
succeeded
in
making
her
hate
me
!
<EOS>
A
positive
labour
of
Hercules
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
!
<EOS>
If
it
be
achieved
,
I
have
cause
to
return
thanks
.
<EOS>
Can
I
trust
your
assertion
,
Isabella
?
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
you
hate
me
?
<EOS>
If
I
let
you
alone
for
half
a
day
,
wo
n't
you
come
sighing
and
wheedling
to
me
again
?
<EOS>
I
daresay
she
would
<EOS>
rather
I
had
seemed
all
tenderness
before
you
:
it
wounds
her
vanity
to
have
the
truth
exposed
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
care
who
knows
that
the
passion
was
wholly
on
one
side
:
<EOS>
and
I
never
told
her
a
lie
about
it
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
accuse
me
of
showing
one
bit
of
deceitful
softness
.
<EOS>
The
first
thing
she
saw
me
do
,
on
coming
out
of
the
Grange
,
was
to
hang
up
her
little
dog
;
and
when
she
pleaded
for
it
,
the
first
words
I
uttered
were
a
wish
that
I
had
the
hanging
of
every
being
belonging
to
her
,
except
one
:
<EOS>
possibly
she
took
that
exception
for
herself
.
<EOS>
But
no
brutality
disgusted
her
:
I
suppose
she
has
an
innate
admiration
of
it
,
if
only
her
precious
person
were
secure
from
injury
!
<EOS>
Now
,
was
it
not
the
depth
of
absurdity
 
of
genuine
idiotcy
,
for
that
pitiful
,
slavish
,
mean
-
minded
brach
to
dream
that
I
could
love
her
?
<EOS>
Tell
your
master
,
Nelly
,
that
I
never
,
in
all
my
life
,
met
with
such
an
abject
thing
as
she
is
.
<EOS>
She
even
disgraces
the
name
of
Linton
;
and
I
've
sometimes
relented
,
from
pure
lack
of
invention
,
in
my
experiments
on
what
she
could
endure
,
and
still
creep
shamefully
cringing
back
!
<EOS>
But
tell
him
,
also
,
to
set
his
fraternal
and
magisterial
heart
at
ease
:
that
I
keep
strictly
within
the
limits
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
I
have
avoided
,
up
to
this
period
,
giving
her
the
slightest
right
to
claim
a
separation
;
and
,
what
's
more
,
she
'd
thank
nobody
for
dividing
us
.
<EOS>
If
she
desired
to
go
,
she
might
:
the
nuisance
of
her
presence
outweighs
the
gratification
to
be
derived
from
tormenting
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
"
said
I
,
"
this
is
the
talk
of
a
madman
;
your
wife
,
most
likely
,
is
convinced
you
are
mad
;
and
,
for
that
reason
,
she
has
borne
with
you
hitherto
:
<EOS>
but
now
that
you
say
she
may
go
,
she
'll
doubtless
avail
herself
of
the
permission
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
so
bewitched
,
ma'am
,
are
you
,
as
to
remain
with
him
of
your
own
accord
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Take
care
,
Ellen
!
"
answered
Isabella
,
her
eyes
sparkling
irefully
<EOS>
;
there
was
no
misdoubting
by
their
expression
the
full
success
of
her
partner
's
endeavours
to
make
himself
detested
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
put
faith
in
a
single
word
he
speaks
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
lying
fiend
!
<EOS>
a
monster
,
and
not
a
human
being
!
<EOS>
I
've
been
told
I
might
leave
him
before
;
and
I
've
made
the
attempt
,
but
I
dare
not
repeat
it
!
<EOS>
Only
,
Ellen
,
promise
you
'll
not
mention
a
syllable
of
his
infamous
conversation
to
my
brother
or
Catherine
.
<EOS>
Whatever
he
may
pretend
,
he
wishes
to
provoke
Edgar
to
desperation
:
he
says
he
has
married
me
on
purpose
to
obtain
power
over
him
;
and
he
sha'n't
obtain
it
 
<EOS>
I
'll
die
first
!
<EOS>
I
just
hope
,
I
pray
,
that
he
may
forget
his
diabolical
prudence
and
kill
me
!
<EOS>
The
single
pleasure
I
can
imagine
is
to
die
,
or
to
see
him
dead
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
 
that
will
do
for
the
present
!
"
said
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
called
upon
in
a
court
of
law
,
you
'll
remember
her
language
,
Nelly
!
<EOS>
And
take
a
good
look
at
that
countenance
<EOS>
:
she
's
near
the
point
which
would
suit
me
.
<EOS>
No
;
you
're
not
fit
to
be
your
own
guardian
,
Isabella
,
now
;
and
<EOS>
I
,
being
your
legal
protector
,
must
retain
you
in
my
custody
,
however
distasteful
the
obligation
may
be
.
<EOS>
Go
up
-
stairs
;
I
have
something
to
say
to
Ellen
Dean
in
private
.
<EOS>
That
's
not
the
way
:
up
-
stairs
,
I
tell
you
!
<EOS>
Why
,
this
is
the
road
upstairs
,
child
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
seized
,
and
thrust
her
from
the
room
;
and
returned
muttering
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
pity
!
<EOS>
I
have
no
pity
!
<EOS>
The
more
the
worms
writhe
,
the
more
I
yearn
to
crush
out
their
entrails
!
<EOS>
It
is
a
moral
teething
;
and
I
grind
with
greater
energy
in
proportion
to
the
increase
of
pain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
understand
what
the
word
pity
means
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
hastening
to
resume
my
bonnet
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
feel
a
touch
of
it
in
your
life
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Put
that
down
!
"
<EOS>
he
interrupted
,
perceiving
my
intention
to
depart
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
going
yet
.
<EOS>
Come
here
now
,
Nelly
:
I
must
either
persuade
or
compel
you
to
aid
me
in
fulfilling
my
determination
to
see
Catherine
,
and
that
without
delay
.
<EOS>
I
swear
that
I
meditate
no
harm
:
<EOS>
I
do
n't
desire
to
cause
any
disturbance
,
or
to
exasperate
or
insult
Mr.
Linton
;
I
only
wish
to
hear
from
herself
how
she
is
,
and
why
she
has
been
ill
;
and
to
ask
if
anything
that
I
could
do
would
be
of
use
to
her
.
<EOS>
Last
night
I
was
in
the
Grange
garden
six
hours
,
and
I
'll
return
there
to
-
night
;
and
every
night
I
'll
haunt
the
place
,
and
<EOS>
every
day
,
till
I
find
an
opportunity
of
entering
.
<EOS>
If
Edgar
Linton
meets
me
,
I
shall
not
hesitate
to
knock
him
down
,
and
give
him
enough
to
insure
his
quiescence
while
I
stay
.
<EOS>
If
his
servants
oppose
me
,
I
shall
threaten
them
off
with
these
pistols
.
<EOS>
But
would
n't
it
be
better
to
prevent
my
coming
in
contact
with
them
,
or
their
master
?
<EOS>
And
you
could
do
it
so
easily
.
<EOS>
I
'd
warn
you
when
I
came
,
and
then
you
might
let
me
in
unobserved
,
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
,
and
watch
till
I
departed
,
your
conscience
quite
calm
:
you
would
be
hindering
mischief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
protested
against
playing
that
treacherous
part
in
my
employer
's
house
:
<EOS>
and
,
besides
,
I
urged
the
cruelty
and
selfishness
of
his
destroying
Mrs.
Linton
's
tranquillity
for
his
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
commonest
occurrence
startles
her
painfully
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
all
nerves
,
and
she
could
n't
bear
the
surprise
,
I
'm
positive
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
persist
,
sir
!
<EOS>
or
else
I
shall
be
obliged
to
inform
my
master
of
your
designs
;
and
he
'll
take
measures
to
secure
his
house
and
its
inmates
from
any
such
unwarrantable
intrusions
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
I
'll
take
measures
to
secure
you
,
woman
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Heathcliff
;
"
you
shall
not
leave
Wuthering
Heights
till
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
foolish
story
to
assert
that
Catherine
could
not
bear
to
see
me
;
and
as
to
surprising
her
,
I
do
n't
desire
it
<EOS>
:
you
must
prepare
her
 
ask
her
if
I
may
come
.
<EOS>
You
say
she
never
mentions
my
name
,
and
that
I
am
never
mentioned
to
her
.
<EOS>
To
whom
should
she
mention
me
if
I
am
a
forbidden
topic
in
the
house
?
<EOS>
She
thinks
you
are
all
spies
for
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
've
no
doubt
she
's
in
hell
among
you
!
<EOS>
I
guess
by
her
silence
,
as
much
as
anything
,
what
she
feels
.
<EOS>
You
say
she
is
often
restless
,
and
anxious
-
looking
:
is
that
a
proof
of
tranquillity
?
<EOS>
You
talk
of
her
mind
being
unsettled
.
<EOS>
How
the
devil
could
it
be
otherwise
in
her
frightful
isolation
?
<EOS>
And
that
insipid
,
paltry
creature
attending
her
from
_
duty
_
and
_
humanity
_
!
<EOS>
From
_
pity
_
and
_
charity
_
!
<EOS>
He
might
as
well
plant
an
oak
in
a
flower
-
pot
,
and
expect
it
to
thrive
,
as
imagine
he
can
restore
her
to
vigour
in
the
soil
of
his
shallow
cares
?
<EOS>
Let
us
settle
it
at
once
:
will
you
stay
here
,
and
am
I
to
fight
my
way
to
Catherine
over
Linton
and
his
footman
?
<EOS>
Or
will
you
be
my
friend
,
as
you
have
been
hitherto
,
and
do
what
I
request
?
<EOS>
Decide
!
<EOS>
because
there
is
no
reason
for
my
lingering
another
minute
,
if
you
persist
in
your
stubborn
ill
-
nature
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
I
argued
and
complained
,
and
flatly
refused
him
fifty
times
;
but
in
the
long
run
he
forced
me
to
an
agreement
.
<EOS>
I
engaged
to
carry
a
letter
from
him
to
my
mistress
;
and
should
she
consent
,
I
promised
to
let
him
have
intelligence
of
Linton
's
next
absence
from
home
,
when
he
might
come
,
and
get
in
as
he
was
able
:
<EOS>
I
would
n't
be
there
,
and
my
fellow
-
servants
should
be
equally
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
Was
it
right
or
wrong
?
<EOS>
I
fear
it
was
wrong
,
though
expedient
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
prevented
another
explosion
by
my
compliance
;
and
I
thought
,
too
,
it
might
create
a
favourable
crisis
in
Catherine
's
mental
illness
:
<EOS>
and
then
I
remembered
Mr.
Edgar
's
stern
rebuke
of
my
carrying
tales
;
and
I
tried
to
smooth
away
all
disquietude
on
the
subject
,
by
affirming
,
with
frequent
iteration
,
that
that
betrayal
of
trust
,
if
it
merited
so
harsh
an
appellation
,
should
be
the
last
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
,
my
journey
homeward
was
sadder
than
my
journey
thither
;
and
many
misgivings
I
had
,
ere
I
could
prevail
on
myself
to
put
the
missive
into
Mrs.
Linton
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
But
here
is
Kenneth
;
I
'll
go
down
,
and
tell
him
how
much
better
you
are
.
<EOS>
My
history
is
_
dree
_
,
as
we
say
,
and
will
serve
to
while
away
another
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Dree
,
and
dreary
!
<EOS>
I
reflected
as
the
good
woman
descended
to
receive
the
doctor
:
and
not
exactly
of
the
kind
which
I
should
have
chosen
to
amuse
me
.
<EOS>
But
never
mind
!
<EOS>
I
'll
extract
wholesome
medicines
from
Mrs.
Dean
's
bitter
herbs
;
and
firstly
,
let
me
beware
of
the
fascination
that
lurks
in
Catherine
Heathcliff
's
brilliant
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
in
a
curious
taking
if
I
surrendered
my
heart
to
that
young
person
,
and
the
daughter
turned
out
a
second
edition
of
the
mother
.
    
<EOS>
Another
week
over
 
<EOS>
and
I
am
so
many
days
nearer
health
,
and
spring
!
<EOS>
I
have
now
heard
all
my
neighbour
's
history
,
at
different
sittings
,
as
the
housekeeper
could
spare
time
from
more
important
occupations
.
<EOS>
I
'll
continue
it
in
her
own
words
,
only
a
little
condensed
.
<EOS>
She
is
,
on
the
whole
,
a
very
fair
narrator
,
and
I
do
n't
think
I
could
improve
her
style
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
evening
,
she
said
,
the
evening
of
my
visit
to
the
Heights
,
I
knew
,
as
well
as
if
I
saw
him
,
that
Mr.
Heathcliff
was
about
the
place
;
and
I
shunned
going
out
,
because
I
still
carried
his
letter
in
my
pocket
,
and
did
n't
want
to
be
threatened
or
teased
any
more
.
<EOS>
I
had
made
up
my
mind
not
to
give
it
till
my
master
went
somewhere
,
as
I
could
not
guess
how
its
receipt
would
affect
Catherine
.
<EOS>
The
consequence
was
,
that
it
did
not
reach
her
before
the
lapse
of
three
days
.
<EOS>
The
fourth
was
Sunday
,
and
I
brought
it
into
her
room
after
the
family
were
gone
to
church
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
manservant
left
to
keep
the
house
with
me
,
and
we
generally
made
a
practice
of
locking
the
doors
during
the
hours
of
service
;
but
on
that
occasion
the
weather
was
so
warm
and
pleasant
that
I
set
them
wide
open
,
and
,
to
fulfil
my
engagement
,
as
I
knew
who
would
be
coming
,
I
told
my
companion
that
the
mistress
wished
very
much
for
some
oranges
,
and
he
must
run
over
to
the
village
and
get
a
few
,
to
be
paid
for
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
departed
,
and
I
went
up
-
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
sat
in
a
loose
white
dress
,
with
a
light
shawl
over
her
shoulders
,
in
the
recess
of
the
open
window
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
Her
thick
,
long
hair
had
been
partly
removed
at
the
beginning
of
her
illness
,
and
now
she
wore
it
simply
combed
in
its
natural
tresses
over
her
temples
and
neck
.
<EOS>
Her
appearance
was
altered
,
as
I
had
told
Heathcliff
;
but
when
she
was
calm
,
there
seemed
unearthly
beauty
in
the
change
.
<EOS>
The
flash
of
her
eyes
had
been
succeeded
by
a
dreamy
and
melancholy
softness
;
they
no
longer
gave
the
impression
of
looking
at
the
objects
around
her
:
they
appeared
always
to
gaze
beyond
,
and
far
beyond
 
<EOS>
you
would
have
said
out
of
this
world
.
<EOS>
Then
,
the
paleness
of
her
face
 
its
haggard
aspect
having
vanished
as
she
recovered
flesh
 
and
the
peculiar
expression
arising
from
her
mental
state
,
though
painfully
suggestive
of
their
causes
,
added
to
the
touching
interest
which
she
awakened
;
and
 
invariably
to
me
,
I
know
,
and
to
any
person
who
saw
her
,
I
should
think
 
refuted
more
tangible
proofs
of
convalescence
,
and
stamped
her
as
one
doomed
to
decay
.
  
<EOS>
A
book
lay
spread
on
the
sill
before
her
,
and
the
scarcely
perceptible
wind
fluttered
its
leaves
at
intervals
.
<EOS>
I
believe
Linton
had
laid
it
there
:
for
she
never
endeavoured
to
divert
herself
with
reading
,
or
occupation
of
any
kind
,
and
he
would
spend
many
an
hour
in
trying
to
entice
her
attention
to
some
subject
which
had
formerly
been
her
amusement
.
<EOS>
She
was
conscious
of
his
aim
,
and
in
her
better
moods
endured
his
efforts
placidly
,
only
showing
their
uselessness
by
now
and
then
suppressing
a
wearied
sigh
,
and
checking
him
at
last
with
the
saddest
of
smiles
and
kisses
.
<EOS>
At
other
times
,
she
would
turn
petulantly
away
,
and
hide
her
face
in
her
hands
,
or
even
push
him
off
angrily
;
and
then
he
took
care
to
let
her
alone
,
for
he
was
certain
of
doing
no
good
.
  
<EOS>
Gimmerton
chapel
bells
were
still
ringing
;
and
the
full
,
mellow
flow
of
the
beck
in
the
valley
came
soothingly
on
the
ear
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
sweet
substitute
for
the
yet
absent
murmur
of
the
summer
foliage
,
which
drowned
that
music
about
the
Grange
when
the
trees
were
in
leaf
.
<EOS>
At
Wuthering
Heights
it
always
sounded
on
quiet
days
following
a
great
thaw
or
a
season
of
steady
rain
.
<EOS>
And
of
Wuthering
Heights
Catherine
was
thinking
as
she
listened
:
that
is
,
if
she
thought
or
listened
at
all
;
but
she
had
the
vague
,
distant
look
I
mentioned
before
,
which
expressed
no
recognition
of
material
things
either
by
ear
or
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
letter
for
you
,
Mrs.
Linton
,
"
I
said
,
gently
inserting
it
in
one
hand
that
rested
on
her
knee
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
read
it
immediately
,
because
it
wants
an
answer
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
break
the
seal
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
answered
,
without
altering
the
direction
of
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
opened
it
 
<EOS>
it
was
very
short
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
"
I
continued
,
"
read
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
drew
away
her
hand
,
and
let
it
fall
.
<EOS>
I
replaced
it
in
her
lap
,
and
stood
waiting
till
it
should
please
her
to
glance
down
;
but
that
movement
was
so
long
delayed
that
at
last
I
resumed
 
"
Must
I
read
it
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
It
is
from
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
start
and
a
troubled
gleam
of
recollection
,
and
a
struggle
to
arrange
her
ideas
.
<EOS>
She
lifted
the
letter
,
and
seemed
to
peruse
it
;
and
when
she
came
to
the
signature
she
sighed
:
yet
still
I
found
she
had
not
gathered
its
import
,
for
,
upon
my
desiring
to
hear
her
reply
,
she
merely
pointed
to
the
name
,
and
gazed
at
me
with
mournful
and
questioning
eagerness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
he
wishes
to
see
you
,
"
said
I
,
guessing
her
need
of
an
interpreter
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
in
the
garden
by
this
time
,
and
impatient
to
know
what
answer
I
shall
bring
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
I
spoke
,
I
observed
a
large
dog
lying
on
the
sunny
grass
beneath
raise
its
ears
as
if
about
to
bark
,
and
then
smoothing
them
back
,
announce
,
by
a
wag
of
the
tail
,
that
some
one
approached
whom
it
did
not
consider
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
bent
forward
,
and
listened
breathlessly
.
<EOS>
The
minute
after
a
step
traversed
the
hall
;
the
open
house
was
too
tempting
for
Heathcliff
to
resist
walking
in
<EOS>
:
most
likely
he
supposed
that
I
was
inclined
to
shirk
my
promise
,
and
so
resolved
to
trust
to
his
own
audacity
.
<EOS>
With
straining
eagerness
Catherine
gazed
towards
the
entrance
of
her
chamber
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
hit
the
right
room
directly
:
she
motioned
me
to
admit
him
,
but
he
found
it
out
ere
I
could
reach
the
door
,
and
in
a
stride
or
two
was
at
her
side
,
and
had
her
grasped
in
his
arms
.
  
<EOS>
He
neither
spoke
nor
loosed
his
hold
for
some
five
minutes
,
during
which
period
he
bestowed
more
kisses
than
ever
he
gave
in
his
life
before
<EOS>
,
I
daresay
:
<EOS>
but
then
my
mistress
had
kissed
him
first
,
and
I
plainly
saw
that
he
could
hardly
bear
,
for
downright
agony
,
to
look
into
her
face
!
<EOS>
The
same
conviction
had
stricken
him
as
me
,
from
the
instant
he
beheld
her
,
that
there
was
no
prospect
of
ultimate
recovery
there
 
<EOS>
she
was
fated
,
sure
to
die
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Cathy
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
life
!
<EOS>
how
can
I
bear
it
?
<EOS>
"
was
the
first
sentence
he
uttered
,
in
a
tone
that
did
not
seek
to
disguise
his
despair
.
<EOS>
And
now
he
stared
at
her
so
earnestly
that
I
thought
the
very
intensity
of
his
gaze
would
bring
tears
into
his
eyes
;
but
they
burned
with
anguish
:
they
did
not
melt
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
now
?
"
said
Catherine
,
leaning
back
,
and
returning
his
look
with
a
suddenly
clouded
brow
:
<EOS>
her
humour
was
a
mere
vane
for
constantly
varying
caprices
.
<EOS>
"
You
and
Edgar
have
broken
my
heart
,
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
And
you
both
come
to
bewail
the
deed
to
me
,
as
if
you
were
the
people
to
be
pitied
!
<EOS>
I
shall
not
pity
you
,
not
I.
<EOS>
You
have
killed
me
 
and
thriven
on
it
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
How
strong
you
are
!
<EOS>
How
many
years
do
you
mean
to
live
after
I
am
gone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
had
knelt
on
one
knee
to
embrace
her
;
he
attempted
to
rise
,
but
she
seized
his
hair
,
and
kept
him
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
hold
you
,
"
she
continued
,
bitterly
,
"
till
we
were
both
dead
!
<EOS>
I
should
n't
care
what
you
suffered
.
<EOS>
I
care
nothing
for
your
sufferings
.
<EOS>
Why
should
n't
you
suffer
?
<EOS>
I
do
!
<EOS>
Will
you
forget
me
?
<EOS>
Will
you
be
happy
when
I
am
in
the
earth
?
<EOS>
Will
you
say
twenty
years
hence
,
"
That
's
the
grave
of
Catherine
Earnshaw
?
<EOS>
I
loved
her
long
ago
,
and
was
wretched
to
lose
her
;
but
it
is
past
.
<EOS>
I
've
loved
many
others
since
:
my
children
are
dearer
to
me
than
she
was
;
and
,
at
death
,
I
shall
not
rejoice
that
I
am
going
to
her
<EOS>
:
I
shall
be
sorry
that
I
must
leave
them
!
"
<EOS>
Will
you
say
so
,
Heathcliff
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
torture
me
till
I
'm
as
mad
as
yourself
,
"
cried
he
,
wrenching
his
head
free
,
and
grinding
his
teeth
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
,
to
a
cool
spectator
,
made
a
strange
and
fearful
picture
.
<EOS>
Well
might
Catherine
deem
that
heaven
would
be
a
land
of
exile
to
her
,
unless
with
her
mortal
body
she
cast
away
her
moral
character
also
.
<EOS>
Her
present
countenance
had
a
wild
vindictiveness
in
its
white
cheek
,
and
a
bloodless
lip
and
scintillating
eye
;
and
she
retained
in
her
closed
fingers
a
portion
of
the
locks
she
had
been
grasping
.
<EOS>
As
to
her
companion
,
while
raising
himself
with
one
hand
,
he
had
taken
her
arm
with
the
other
;
and
so
inadequate
was
his
stock
of
gentleness
to
the
requirements
of
her
condition
,
that
on
his
letting
go
<EOS>
I
saw
four
distinct
impressions
left
blue
in
the
colourless
skin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
possessed
with
a
devil
,
"
he
pursued
,
savagely
,
"
to
talk
in
that
manner
to
me
when
you
are
dying
?
<EOS>
Do
you
reflect
that
all
those
words
will
be
branded
in
my
memory
,
and
eating
deeper
eternally
after
you
have
left
me
?
<EOS>
You
know
you
lie
to
say
I
have
killed
you
:
and
,
Catherine
,
you
know
that
I
could
as
soon
forget
you
as
my
existence
!
<EOS>
Is
it
not
sufficient
for
your
infernal
selfishness
,
that
while
you
are
at
peace
I
shall
writhe
in
the
torments
of
hell
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
be
at
peace
,
"
moaned
Catherine
,
<EOS>
recalled
to
a
sense
of
physical
weakness
by
the
violent
,
unequal
throbbing
of
her
heart
,
which
beat
visibly
and
audibly
under
this
excess
of
agitation
.
<EOS>
She
said
nothing
further
till
the
paroxysm
was
over
;
then
she
continued
,
more
kindly
    
"
I
'm
not
wishing
you
greater
torment
than
I
have
,
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
us
never
to
be
parted
:
and
should
a
word
of
mine
distress
you
hereafter
,
think
I
feel
the
same
distress
underground
,
and
for
my
own
sake
,
forgive
me
!
<EOS>
Come
here
and
kneel
down
again
!
<EOS>
You
never
harmed
me
in
your
life
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
if
you
nurse
anger
,
that
will
be
worse
to
remember
than
my
harsh
words
!
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
come
here
again
?
<EOS>
Do
!
"
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
went
to
the
back
of
her
chair
,
and
leant
over
,
but
not
so
far
as
to
let
her
see
his
face
,
which
was
livid
with
emotion
.
<EOS>
She
bent
round
to
look
at
him
;
he
would
not
permit
it
:
turning
abruptly
<EOS>
,
he
walked
to
the
fireplace
,
where
he
stood
,
silent
,
with
his
back
towards
us
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
's
glance
followed
him
suspiciously
:
every
movement
woke
a
new
sentiment
in
her
.
<EOS>
After
a
pause
and
a
prolonged
gaze
,
she
resumed
;
addressing
me
in
accents
of
indignant
disappointment
:
    
"
Oh
,
you
see
,
<EOS>
Nelly
,
he
would
not
relent
a
moment
to
keep
me
out
of
the
grave
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
That
_
is
how
I
'm
loved
!
<EOS>
Well
,
never
mind
.
<EOS>
That
is
not
_
my
_
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
I
shall
love
mine
yet
;
and
take
him
with
me
:
he
's
in
my
soul
.
<EOS>
And
,
"
added
she
musingly
,
"
the
thing
that
irks
me
most
is
this
shattered
prison
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
I
'm
tired
of
being
enclosed
here
.
<EOS>
I
'm
wearying
to
escape
into
that
glorious
world
,
and
to
be
always
there
:
not
seeing
it
dimly
through
tears
,
and
yearning
for
it
through
the
walls
of
an
aching
heart
:
but
really
with
it
,
and
in
it
.
<EOS>
Nelly
,
you
think
you
are
better
and
more
fortunate
than
I
;
in
full
health
and
strength
:
you
are
sorry
for
me
 
very
soon
that
will
be
altered
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
sorry
for
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
incomparably
beyond
and
above
you
all
.
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
_
wonder
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
he
wo
n't
be
near
me
!
"
<EOS>
She
went
on
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
he
wished
it
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
,
dear
!
<EOS>
you
should
not
be
sullen
now
.
<EOS>
Do
come
to
me
,
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
her
eagerness
she
rose
and
supported
herself
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
.
<EOS>
At
that
earnest
appeal
he
turned
to
her
,
looking
absolutely
desperate
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
,
wide
and
wet
,
at
last
flashed
fiercely
on
her
;
his
breast
heaved
convulsively
.
<EOS>
An
instant
they
held
asunder
,
and
then
how
they
met
I
hardly
saw
,
but
Catherine
made
a
spring
,
and
he
caught
her
,
and
they
were
locked
in
an
embrace
from
which
I
thought
my
mistress
would
never
be
released
alive
:
in
fact
,
to
my
eyes
,
she
seemed
directly
insensible
.
<EOS>
He
flung
himself
into
the
nearest
seat
,
and
on
my
approaching
hurriedly
to
ascertain
if
she
had
fainted
,
he
gnashed
at
me
,
and
foamed
like
a
mad
dog
,
and
gathered
her
to
him
with
greedy
jealousy
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
feel
as
if
I
were
in
the
company
of
a
creature
of
my
own
species
:
it
appeared
that
he
would
not
understand
,
though
I
spoke
to
him
;
so
I
stood
off
,
and
held
my
tongue
,
in
great
perplexity
.
  
<EOS>
A
movement
of
Catherine
's
relieved
me
a
little
presently
:
she
put
up
her
hand
to
clasp
his
neck
,
and
bring
her
cheek
to
his
as
he
held
her
;
while
he
,
in
return
,
covering
her
with
frantic
caresses
,
said
wildly
    
"
You
teach
me
now
how
cruel
you
've
been
 
cruel
and
false
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Why
_
did
you
despise
me
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Why
_
did
you
betray
your
own
heart
,
Cathy
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
one
word
of
comfort
.
<EOS>
You
deserve
this
.
<EOS>
You
have
killed
yourself
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
you
may
kiss
me
,
and
cry
;
and
wring
out
my
kisses
and
tears
<EOS>
:
they
'll
blight
you
 
<EOS>
they
'll
damn
you
.
<EOS>
You
loved
me
 
then
<EOS>
what
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
right
<EOS>
_
had
you
to
leave
me
?
<EOS>
What
right
 
answer
me
 
for
the
poor
fancy
you
felt
for
Linton
?
<EOS>
Because
misery
and
degradation
,
and
death
,
and
nothing
that
God
or
Satan
could
inflict
would
have
parted
us
,
_
<EOS>
you
_
,
of
your
own
will
,
did
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
broken
your
heart
 
_
you
_
have
broken
it
;
and
in
breaking
it
,
you
have
broken
mine
.
<EOS>
So
much
the
worse
for
me
that
I
am
strong
.
<EOS>
Do
I
want
to
live
?
<EOS>
What
kind
of
living
will
it
be
when
you
 
<EOS>
oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
would
_
you
<EOS>
_
like
to
live
with
your
soul
in
the
grave
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
alone
.
<EOS>
Let
me
alone
,
"
sobbed
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
've
done
wrong
,
I
'm
dying
for
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
enough
!
<EOS>
You
left
me
too
:
but
I
wo
n't
upbraid
you
!
<EOS>
I
forgive
you
.
<EOS>
Forgive
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
hard
to
forgive
,
and
to
look
at
those
eyes
,
and
feel
those
wasted
hands
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Kiss
me
again
;
and
do
n't
let
me
see
your
eyes
!
<EOS>
I
forgive
what
you
have
done
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
love
_
<EOS>
my
_
murderer
 
<EOS>
but
_
yours
<EOS>
_
!
<EOS>
How
can
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
silent
 
<EOS>
their
faces
hid
against
each
other
,
and
washed
by
each
other
's
tears
.
<EOS>
At
least
,
I
suppose
the
weeping
was
on
both
sides
;
as
it
seemed
Heathcliff
could
weep
on
a
great
occasion
like
this
.
  
<EOS>
I
grew
very
uncomfortable
,
meanwhile
;
for
the
afternoon
wore
fast
away
,
the
man
whom
I
had
sent
off
returned
from
his
errand
,
and
I
could
distinguish
,
by
the
shine
of
the
western
sun
up
the
valley
,
a
concourse
thickening
outside
Gimmerton
chapel
porch
.
  
<EOS>
"
Service
is
over
,
"
I
announced
.
<EOS>
"
My
master
will
be
here
in
half
an
hour
.
"
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
groaned
a
curse
,
and
strained
Catherine
closer
:
she
never
moved
.
  
<EOS>
Ere
long
I
perceived
a
group
of
the
servants
passing
up
the
road
towards
the
kitchen
wing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
was
not
far
behind
;
he
opened
the
gate
himself
and
sauntered
slowly
up
,
probably
enjoying
the
lovely
afternoon
that
breathed
as
soft
as
summer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
he
is
here
,
"
I
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
For
heaven
's
sake
,
hurry
down
!
<EOS>
You
'll
not
meet
any
one
on
the
front
stairs
.
<EOS>
Do
be
quick
;
and
stay
among
the
trees
till
he
is
fairly
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
,
Cathy
,
"
said
Heathcliff
,
seeking
to
extricate
himself
from
his
companion
's
arms
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
I
live
,
I
'll
see
you
again
before
you
are
asleep
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
stray
five
yards
from
your
window
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
go
!
"
<EOS>
she
answered
,
holding
him
as
firmly
as
her
strength
allowed
.
<EOS>
"
You
_
shall
_
<EOS>
not
,
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
one
hour
,
"
he
pleaded
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
for
one
minute
,
"
she
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
<EOS>
must
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
Linton
will
be
up
immediately
,
"
persisted
the
alarmed
intruder
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
have
risen
,
and
unfixed
her
fingers
by
the
act
 
she
clung
fast
,
gasping
<EOS>
:
there
was
mad
resolution
in
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
she
shrieked
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
,
do
n't
go
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
last
time
!
<EOS>
Edgar
will
not
hurt
us
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
,
I
shall
die
!
<EOS>
I
shall
die
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Damn
the
fool
!
<EOS>
There
he
is
,
"
cried
Heathcliff
,
sinking
back
into
his
seat
.
"
<EOS>
Hush
,
my
darling
!
<EOS>
Hush
,
hush
,
Catherine
!
<EOS>
I
'll
stay
.
<EOS>
If
he
shot
me
so
,
I
'd
expire
with
a
blessing
on
my
lips
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
there
they
were
fast
again
.
<EOS>
I
heard
my
master
mounting
the
stairs
 
<EOS>
the
cold
sweat
ran
from
my
forehead
:
I
was
horrified
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
listen
to
her
ravings
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
passionately
.
<EOS>
"
She
does
not
know
what
she
says
.
<EOS>
Will
you
ruin
her
,
because
she
has
not
wit
to
help
herself
?
<EOS>
Get
up
!
<EOS>
You
could
be
free
instantly
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
most
diabolical
deed
that
ever
you
did
.
<EOS>
We
are
all
done
for
 
master
,
mistress
,
and
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
wrung
my
hands
,
and
cried
out
;
and
Mr.
Linton
hastened
his
step
at
the
noise
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
my
agitation
,
I
was
sincerely
glad
to
observe
that
Catherine
's
arms
had
fallen
relaxed
,
and
her
head
hung
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
fainted
,
or
dead
,
"
I
thought
:
"
so
much
the
better
.
<EOS>
Far
better
that
she
should
be
dead
,
than
lingering
a
burden
and
a
misery
-
maker
to
all
about
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Edgar
sprang
to
his
unbidden
guest
,
blanched
with
astonishment
and
rage
.
<EOS>
What
he
meant
to
do
I
can
not
tell
;
however
,
the
other
stopped
all
demonstrations
,
at
once
,
by
placing
the
lifeless
-
looking
form
in
his
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
there
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Unless
you
be
a
fiend
,
help
her
first
 
<EOS>
then
you
shall
speak
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
walked
into
the
parlour
,
and
sat
down
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
summoned
me
,
and
with
great
difficulty
,
and
after
resorting
to
many
means
,
we
managed
to
restore
her
to
sensation
;
but
she
was
all
bewildered
;
she
sighed
,
and
moaned
,
and
knew
nobody
.
<EOS>
Edgar
,
in
his
anxiety
for
her
,
forgot
her
hated
friend
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
.
<EOS>
I
went
,
at
the
earliest
opportunity
,
and
besought
him
to
depart
;
affirming
that
Catherine
was
better
,
and
he
should
hear
from
me
in
the
morning
how
she
passed
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
refuse
to
go
out
of
doors
,
"
he
answered
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
shall
stay
in
the
garden
:
<EOS>
and
,
Nelly
,
mind
you
keep
your
word
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
under
those
larch
-
trees
.
<EOS>
Mind
!
<EOS>
or
I
pay
another
visit
,
whether
Linton
be
in
or
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
sent
a
rapid
glance
through
the
half
-
open
door
of
the
chamber
,
and
,
ascertaining
that
what
I
stated
was
apparently
true
,
delivered
the
house
of
his
luckless
presence
.
    
<EOS>
About
twelve
o'clock
that
night
was
born
the
Catherine
you
saw
at
Wuthering
Heights
:
a
puny
,
seven
-
months
'
child
;
and
two
hours
after
the
mother
died
,
having
never
recovered
sufficient
consciousness
to
miss
Heathcliff
,
or
know
Edgar
.
<EOS>
The
latter
's
distraction
at
his
bereavement
is
a
subject
too
painful
to
be
dwelt
on
;
its
after
-
effects
showed
how
deep
the
sorrow
sunk
.
<EOS>
A
great
addition
,
in
my
eyes
,
was
his
being
left
without
an
heir
.
<EOS>
I
bemoaned
that
,
as
I
gazed
on
the
feeble
orphan
;
and
I
mentally
abused
old
Linton
for
(
what
was
only
natural
partiality
)
<EOS>
the
securing
his
estate
to
his
own
daughter
,
instead
of
his
son
's
.
<EOS>
An
unwelcomed
infant
<EOS>
it
was
,
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
It
might
have
wailed
out
of
life
,
and
nobody
cared
a
morsel
,
during
those
first
hours
of
existence
.
<EOS>
We
redeemed
the
neglect
afterwards
;
but
its
beginning
was
as
friendless
as
its
end
is
likely
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
Next
morning
 
bright
and
cheerful
out
of
doors
 
stole
softened
in
through
the
blinds
of
the
silent
room
,
and
suffused
the
couch
and
its
occupant
with
a
mellow
,
tender
glow
.
<EOS>
Edgar
Linton
had
his
head
laid
on
the
pillow
,
and
his
eyes
shut
.
<EOS>
His
young
and
fair
features
were
almost
as
deathlike
as
those
of
the
form
beside
him
,
and
almost
as
fixed
:
but
_
his
_
was
the
hush
of
exhausted
anguish
,
and
_
hers
_
of
perfect
peace
.
<EOS>
Her
brow
smooth
,
her
lids
closed
,
her
lips
wearing
the
expression
of
a
smile
;
no
angel
in
heaven
could
be
more
beautiful
than
she
appeared
.
<EOS>
And
I
partook
of
the
infinite
calm
in
which
she
lay
<EOS>
:
my
mind
was
never
in
a
holier
frame
than
while
I
gazed
on
that
untroubled
image
of
Divine
rest
.
<EOS>
I
instinctively
echoed
the
words
she
had
uttered
a
few
hours
before
:
"
Incomparably
beyond
and
above
us
all
!
<EOS>
Whether
still
on
earth
or
now
in
heaven
,
her
spirit
is
at
home
with
God
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
if
it
be
a
peculiarity
in
me
,
but
I
am
seldom
otherwise
than
happy
while
watching
in
the
chamber
of
death
<EOS>
,
should
no
frenzied
or
despairing
mourner
share
the
duty
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
see
a
repose
that
neither
earth
nor
hell
can
break
,
and
I
feel
an
assurance
of
the
endless
and
shadowless
hereafter
 
<EOS>
the
Eternity
they
have
entered
 
where
life
is
boundless
in
its
duration
,
and
love
in
its
sympathy
,
and
joy
in
its
fulness
.
<EOS>
I
noticed
on
that
occasion
how
much
selfishness
there
is
even
in
a
love
like
Mr.
Linton
's
,
when
he
so
regretted
Catherine
's
blessed
release
!
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
one
might
have
doubted
,
after
the
wayward
and
impatient
existence
<EOS>
she
had
led
,
whether
she
merited
a
haven
of
peace
at
last
.
<EOS>
One
might
doubt
in
seasons
of
cold
reflection
;
but
not
then
,
in
the
presence
of
her
corpse
.
<EOS>
It
asserted
its
own
tranquillity
,
which
seemed
a
pledge
of
equal
quiet
to
its
former
inhabitant
.
  
<EOS>
Do
you
believe
such
people
are
happy
in
the
other
world
,
sir
?
<EOS>
I
'd
give
a
great
deal
to
know
.
  
<EOS>
I
declined
answering
Mrs.
Dean
's
question
,
which
struck
me
as
something
heterodox
.
<EOS>
She
proceeded
:
  
<EOS>
Retracing
the
course
of
Catherine
Linton
,
I
fear
we
have
no
right
to
think
she
is
;
but
we
'll
leave
her
with
her
Maker
.
  
<EOS>
The
master
looked
asleep
,
and
I
ventured
soon
after
sunrise
to
quit
the
room
and
steal
out
to
the
pure
refreshing
air
.
<EOS>
The
servants
thought
me
gone
to
shake
off
the
drowsiness
of
my
protracted
watch
;
in
reality
,
my
chief
motive
was
seeing
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
remained
among
the
larches
all
night
,
he
would
have
heard
nothing
of
the
stir
at
the
Grange
;
unless
,
perhaps
,
he
might
catch
the
gallop
of
the
messenger
going
to
Gimmerton
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
come
nearer
,
he
would
probably
be
aware
,
from
the
lights
flitting
to
and
fro
,
and
the
opening
and
shutting
of
the
outer
doors
,
that
all
was
not
right
within
.
<EOS>
I
wished
,
yet
feared
,
to
find
him
.
<EOS>
I
felt
the
terrible
news
must
be
told
,
and
I
longed
to
get
it
over
;
but
how
to
do
it
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
.
<EOS>
He
was
there
 
at
least
,
a
few
yards
further
in
the
park
;
leant
against
an
old
ash
-
tree
,
his
hat
off
,
and
his
hair
soaked
with
the
dew
that
had
gathered
on
the
budded
branches
,
and
fell
pattering
round
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
standing
a
long
time
in
that
position
,
for
I
saw
a
pair
of
ousels
passing
and
repassing
scarcely
three
feet
from
him
,
busy
in
building
their
nest
,
and
regarding
his
proximity
no
more
than
that
of
a
piece
of
timber
.
<EOS>
They
flew
off
at
my
approach
,
and
he
raised
his
eyes
and
spoke
:
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
dead
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
;
"
I
've
not
waited
for
you
to
learn
that
.
<EOS>
Put
your
handkerchief
away
 
do
n't
snivel
before
me
.
<EOS>
Damn
you
all
!
<EOS>
she
wants
none
of
your
tears
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
weeping
as
much
for
him
as
her
<EOS>
:
we
do
sometimes
pity
creatures
that
have
none
of
the
feeling
either
for
themselves
or
others
.
<EOS>
When
I
first
looked
into
his
face
,
I
perceived
that
he
had
got
intelligence
of
the
catastrophe
;
and
a
foolish
notion
struck
me
that
his
heart
was
quelled
and
he
prayed
,
because
his
lips
moved
and
his
gaze
was
bent
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
she
's
dead
!
"
<EOS>
I
answered
,
checking
my
sobs
and
drying
my
cheeks
.
"
<EOS>
Gone
to
heaven
,
I
hope
;
where
we
may
,
<EOS>
every
one
,
join
her
,
if
we
take
due
warning
and
leave
our
evil
ways
to
follow
good
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
_
<EOS>
she
_
take
due
warning
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Heathcliff
,
attempting
a
sneer
.
<EOS>
"
Did
she
die
like
a
saint
?
<EOS>
Come
,
give
me
a
true
history
of
the
event
.
<EOS>
How
did
 
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
endeavoured
to
pronounce
the
name
,
but
could
not
manage
it
;
and
compressing
his
mouth
he
held
a
silent
combat
with
his
inward
agony
,
defying
,
meanwhile
,
my
sympathy
with
an
unflinching
,
ferocious
stare
.
<EOS>
"
How
did
she
die
?
<EOS>
"
he
resumed
,
at
last
 
fain
,
notwithstanding
his
hardihood
,
to
have
a
support
behind
him
;
for
,
after
the
struggle
,
he
trembled
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
to
his
very
finger
-
ends
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
wretch
!
<EOS>
"
I
thought
;
"
you
have
a
heart
and
nerves
the
same
as
your
brother
men
!
<EOS>
Why
should
you
be
anxious
to
conceal
them
?
<EOS>
Your
pride
can
not
blind
God
!
<EOS>
You
tempt
him
to
wring
them
,
till
he
forces
a
cry
of
humiliation
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Quietly
as
a
lamb
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
answered
,
aloud
.
"
<EOS>
She
drew
a
sigh
,
and
stretched
herself
,
like
a
child
reviving
,
and
sinking
again
to
sleep
;
and
five
minutes
after
I
felt
one
little
pulse
at
her
heart
,
and
nothing
more
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
 
did
she
ever
mention
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
hesitating
,
as
if
he
dreaded
the
answer
to
his
question
would
introduce
details
that
he
could
not
bear
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
senses
never
returned
:
she
recognised
nobody
from
the
time
you
left
her
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
She
lies
with
a
sweet
smile
on
her
face
;
and
her
latest
ideas
wandered
back
to
pleasant
early
days
.
<EOS>
Her
life
closed
in
a
gentle
dream
 
<EOS>
may
she
wake
as
kindly
in
the
other
world
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
she
wake
in
torment
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
with
frightful
vehemence
,
stamping
his
foot
,
and
groaning
in
a
sudden
paroxysm
of
ungovernable
passion
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
she
's
a
liar
to
the
end
!
<EOS>
Where
is
she
?
<EOS>
Not
_
there
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
not
in
heaven
 
not
perished
 
<EOS>
where
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
said
you
cared
nothing
for
my
sufferings
!
<EOS>
And
I
pray
one
prayer
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
it
till
my
tongue
stiffens
 
Catherine
Earnshaw
,
may
you
not
rest
as
long
as
I
am
living
;
you
said
I
killed
you
 
<EOS>
haunt
me
,
then
!
<EOS>
The
murdered
_
do
_
haunt
their
murderers
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
ghosts
_
have
_
wandered
on
earth
.
<EOS>
Be
with
me
always
 
take
any
form
 
<EOS>
drive
me
mad
!
<EOS>
only
_
do
_
not
leave
me
in
this
abyss
,
where
I
can
not
find
you
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
it
is
unutterable
!
<EOS>
I
_
can
not
_
live
without
my
life
!
<EOS>
I
_
can
not
_
live
without
my
soul
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
dashed
his
head
against
the
knotted
trunk
;
and
,
lifting
up
his
eyes
,
howled
,
not
like
a
man
,
but
like
a
savage
beast
being
goaded
to
death
with
knives
and
spears
.
<EOS>
I
observed
several
splashes
of
blood
about
the
bark
of
the
tree
,
and
his
hand
and
forehead
were
both
stained
;
probably
the
scene
I
witnessed
was
a
repetition
of
others
acted
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
It
hardly
moved
my
compassion
 
<EOS>
it
appalled
me
:
still
,
I
felt
reluctant
to
quit
him
so
.
<EOS>
But
the
moment
he
recollected
himself
enough
to
notice
me
watching
,
he
thundered
a
command
for
me
to
go
,
and
I
obeyed
.
<EOS>
He
was
beyond
my
skill
to
quiet
or
console
!
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
's
funeral
was
appointed
to
take
place
on
the
Friday
following
her
decease
;
and
till
then
her
coffin
remained
uncovered
,
and
strewn
with
flowers
and
scented
leaves
,
in
the
great
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Linton
spent
his
days
and
nights
there
,
a
sleepless
guardian
;
and
 
a
circumstance
concealed
from
all
but
me
 
<EOS>
Heathcliff
spent
his
nights
,
at
least
,
outside
,
equally
a
stranger
to
repose
.
<EOS>
I
held
no
communication
with
him
:
still
,
I
was
conscious
of
his
design
to
enter
,
if
he
could
;
and
on
the
Tuesday
,
a
little
after
dark
,
when
my
master
,
from
sheer
fatigue
,
had
been
compelled
to
retire
a
couple
of
hours
,
I
went
and
opened
one
of
the
windows
;
moved
by
his
perseverance
to
give
him
a
chance
of
bestowing
on
the
faded
image
of
his
idol
one
final
adieu
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
omit
to
avail
himself
of
the
opportunity
,
cautiously
and
briefly
;
too
cautiously
to
betray
his
presence
by
the
slightest
noise
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
should
n't
have
discovered
that
he
had
been
there
,
except
for
the
disarrangement
of
the
drapery
about
the
corpse
's
face
,
and
for
observing
on
the
floor
a
curl
of
light
hair
,
fastened
with
a
silver
thread
;
which
,
on
examination
,
I
ascertained
to
have
been
taken
from
a
locket
hung
round
Catherine
's
neck
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
had
opened
the
trinket
and
cast
out
its
contents
,
replacing
them
by
a
black
lock
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
I
twisted
the
two
,
and
enclosed
them
together
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Earnshaw
was
,
of
course
,
invited
to
attend
the
remains
of
his
sister
to
the
grave
;
he
sent
no
excuse
,
but
he
never
came
;
so
that
,
besides
her
husband
,
the
mourners
were
wholly
composed
of
tenants
and
servants
.
<EOS>
Isabella
was
not
asked
.
  
<EOS>
The
place
of
Catherine
's
interment
,
to
the
surprise
of
the
villagers
,
was
neither
in
the
chapel
under
the
carved
monument
of
the
Lintons
,
nor
yet
by
the
tombs
of
her
own
relations
,
outside
.
<EOS>
It
was
dug
on
a
green
slope
in
a
corner
of
the
kirk
-
yard
,
where
the
wall
is
so
low
that
heath
and
bilberry
-
plants
have
climbed
over
it
from
the
moor
;
and
peat
-
mould
almost
buries
it
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
lies
in
the
same
spot
now
;
and
they
have
each
a
simple
headstone
above
,
and
a
plain
grey
block
at
their
feet
,
to
mark
the
graves
.
    
<EOS>
That
Friday
made
the
last
of
our
fine
days
for
a
month
.
<EOS>
In
the
evening
the
weather
broke
:
<EOS>
the
wind
shifted
from
south
to
north
-
east
,
and
brought
rain
first
,
and
then
sleet
and
snow
.
<EOS>
On
the
morrow
one
could
hardly
imagine
that
there
had
been
three
weeks
of
summer
:
the
primroses
and
crocuses
were
hidden
under
wintry
drifts
;
the
larks
were
silent
,
the
young
leaves
of
the
early
trees
smitten
and
blackened
.
<EOS>
And
dreary
,
and
chill
,
and
dismal
,
that
morrow
did
creep
over
!
<EOS>
My
master
kept
his
room
;
I
took
possession
of
the
lonely
parlour
,
converting
it
into
a
nursery
:
<EOS>
and
there
I
was
,
sitting
with
the
moaning
doll
of
a
child
laid
on
my
knee
;
rocking
it
to
and
fro
,
and
watching
,
meanwhile
,
the
still
driving
flakes
build
up
the
uncurtained
window
,
when
the
door
opened
,
and
some
person
entered
,
out
of
breath
and
laughing
!
<EOS>
My
anger
was
greater
than
my
astonishment
for
a
minute
.
<EOS>
I
supposed
it
one
of
the
maids
,
and
I
cried
 
"
Have
done
!
<EOS>
How
dare
you
show
your
giddiness
here
;
What
would
Mr.
Linton
say
if
he
heard
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
!
"
answered
a
familiar
voice
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
know
Edgar
is
in
bed
,
and
I
can
not
stop
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
the
speaker
came
forward
to
the
fire
,
panting
and
holding
her
hand
to
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
run
the
whole
way
from
Wuthering
Heights
!
"
<EOS>
she
continued
,
after
a
pause
;
"
except
where
I
've
flown
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
count
the
number
of
falls
I
've
had
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
'm
aching
all
over
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
alarmed
!
<EOS>
There
shall
be
an
explanation
as
soon
as
I
can
give
it
;
only
just
have
the
goodness
to
step
out
and
order
the
carriage
to
take
me
on
to
Gimmerton
,
and
tell
a
servant
to
seek
up
a
few
clothes
in
my
wardrobe
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
intruder
was
Mrs.
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
seemed
in
no
laughing
predicament
:
her
hair
streamed
on
her
shoulders
,
dripping
with
snow
and
water
;
she
was
dressed
in
the
girlish
dress
she
commonly
wore
,
befitting
her
age
more
than
her
position
:
a
low
frock
with
short
sleeves
,
and
nothing
on
either
head
or
neck
.
<EOS>
The
frock
was
of
light
silk
,
and
clung
to
her
with
wet
,
and
her
feet
were
protected
merely
by
thin
slippers
;
add
to
this
a
deep
cut
under
one
ear
,
which
only
the
cold
prevented
from
bleeding
profusely
,
a
white
face
scratched
and
bruised
,
and
a
frame
hardly
able
to
support
itself
through
fatigue
;
and
you
may
fancy
my
first
fright
was
not
much
allayed
when
I
had
had
leisure
to
examine
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
young
lady
,
"
I
exclaimed
,
"
I
'll
stir
nowhere
,
and
hear
nothing
,
till
you
have
removed
every
article
of
your
clothes
,
and
put
on
dry
things
;
and
certainly
you
shall
not
go
to
Gimmerton
to
-
night
,
so
it
is
needless
to
order
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
shall
,
"
she
said
;
"
walking
or
riding
:
<EOS>
yet
I
've
no
objection
to
dress
myself
decently
.
<EOS>
And
 
ah
,
see
how
it
flows
down
my
neck
now
!
<EOS>
The
fire
does
make
it
smart
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
insisted
on
my
fulfilling
her
directions
,
before
she
would
let
me
touch
her
;
and
not
till
after
the
coachman
had
been
instructed
to
get
ready
,
and
a
maid
set
to
pack
up
some
necessary
attire
,
did
I
obtain
her
consent
for
binding
the
wound
and
helping
to
change
her
garments
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Ellen
,
"
she
said
,
when
my
task
was
finished
and
she
was
seated
in
an
easy
-
chair
on
the
hearth
,
with
a
cup
of
tea
before
her
,
"
you
sit
down
opposite
me
,
and
put
poor
Catherine
's
baby
away
:
I
do
n't
like
to
see
it
!
<EOS>
You
must
n't
think
I
care
little
for
Catherine
,
because
I
behaved
so
foolishly
on
entering
:
I
've
cried
,
too
,
<EOS>
bitterly
 
yes
,
more
than
any
one
else
has
reason
to
cry
.
<EOS>
We
parted
unreconciled
,
you
remember
,
and
I
sha'n't
forgive
myself
.
<EOS>
But
,
for
all
that
,
I
was
not
going
to
sympathise
with
him
 
the
brute
beast
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
give
me
the
poker
!
<EOS>
This
is
the
last
thing
of
his
I
have
about
me
:
"
she
slipped
the
gold
ring
from
her
third
finger
,
and
threw
it
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
smash
it
!
"
<EOS>
she
continued
,
striking
it
with
childish
spite
,
"
and
then
I
'll
burn
it
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
took
and
dropped
the
misused
article
among
the
coals
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
he
shall
buy
another
,
if
he
gets
me
back
again
.
<EOS>
He
'd
be
capable
of
coming
to
seek
me
,
to
tease
Edgar
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
stay
,
lest
that
notion
should
possess
his
wicked
head
!
<EOS>
And
besides
,
Edgar
has
not
been
kind
,
has
he
?
<EOS>
And
I
wo
n't
come
suing
for
his
assistance
;
nor
will
I
bring
him
into
more
trouble
.
<EOS>
Necessity
compelled
me
to
seek
shelter
here
;
though
,
if
I
had
not
learned
he
was
out
of
the
way
,
I
'd
have
halted
at
the
kitchen
,
washed
my
face
,
warmed
myself
,
got
you
to
bring
what
I
wanted
,
and
departed
again
to
anywhere
out
of
the
reach
of
my
accursed
 
of
that
incarnate
goblin
!
<EOS>
Ah
,
he
was
in
such
a
fury
!
<EOS>
If
he
had
caught
me
!
<EOS>
It
's
a
pity
Earnshaw
is
not
his
match
in
strength
:
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
run
till
I
'd
seen
him
all
but
demolished
,
had
Hindley
been
able
to
do
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
do
n't
talk
so
fast
,
Miss
!
<EOS>
"
I
interrupted
;
"
you
'll
disorder
the
handkerchief
I
have
tied
round
your
face
,
and
make
the
cut
bleed
again
.
<EOS>
Drink
your
tea
,
and
take
breath
,
and
give
over
laughing
:
<EOS>
laughter
is
sadly
out
of
place
under
this
roof
,
and
in
your
condition
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
An
undeniable
truth
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
that
child
!
<EOS>
It
maintains
a
constant
wail
 
send
it
out
of
my
hearing
for
an
hour
;
I
sha'n't
stay
any
longer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
rang
the
bell
,
and
committed
it
to
a
servant
's
care
;
and
then
I
inquired
what
had
urged
her
to
escape
from
Wuthering
Heights
in
such
an
unlikely
plight
,
and
where
she
meant
to
go
,
as
she
refused
remaining
with
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ought
,
and
I
wished
to
remain
,
"
answered
she
,
"
to
cheer
Edgar
and
take
care
of
the
baby
,
for
two
things
,
and
because
the
Grange
is
my
right
home
.
<EOS>
But
I
tell
you
he
would
n't
let
me
!
<EOS>
Do
you
think
he
could
bear
to
see
me
grow
fat
and
merry
 
could
bear
to
think
that
we
were
tranquil
,
and
not
resolve
on
poisoning
our
comfort
?
<EOS>
Now
,
I
have
the
satisfaction
of
being
sure
that
he
detests
me
,
to
the
point
of
its
annoying
him
seriously
to
have
me
within
ear
-
shot
or
eyesight
:
<EOS>
I
notice
,
when
I
enter
his
presence
,
the
muscles
of
his
countenance
are
involuntarily
distorted
into
an
expression
of
hatred
;
partly
arising
from
his
knowledge
of
the
good
causes
I
have
to
feel
that
sentiment
for
him
,
and
partly
from
original
aversion
.
<EOS>
It
is
strong
enough
to
make
me
feel
pretty
certain
that
he
would
not
chase
me
over
England
,
supposing
I
contrived
a
clear
escape
;
and
therefore
I
must
get
quite
away
.
<EOS>
I
've
recovered
from
my
first
desire
to
be
killed
by
him
:
I
'd
rather
he
'd
kill
himself
!
<EOS>
He
has
extinguished
my
love
effectually
,
and
so
I
'm
at
my
ease
.
<EOS>
I
can
recollect
yet
how
I
loved
him
;
and
can
dimly
imagine
that
I
could
still
be
loving
him
,
if
 
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
Even
if
he
had
doted
on
me
,
the
devilish
nature
would
have
revealed
its
existence
somehow
.
<EOS>
Catherine
had
an
awfully
perverted
taste
to
esteem
him
so
dearly
,
knowing
him
so
well
.
<EOS>
Monster
!
<EOS>
would
that
he
could
be
blotted
out
of
creation
,
and
out
of
my
memory
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
hush
!
<EOS>
He
's
a
human
being
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Be
more
charitable
:
there
are
worse
men
than
he
is
yet
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
not
a
human
being
,
"
she
retorted
;
"
and
he
has
no
claim
on
my
charity
.
<EOS>
I
gave
him
my
heart
,
and
he
took
and
pinched
it
to
death
,
and
flung
it
back
to
me
.
<EOS>
People
feel
with
their
hearts
,
Ellen
:
and
since
he
has
destroyed
mine
,
I
have
not
power
to
feel
for
him
:
and
I
would
not
,
though
he
groaned
from
this
to
his
dying
day
,
and
wept
tears
of
blood
for
Catherine
!
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
,
indeed
,
I
would
n't
!
"
<EOS>
And
here
Isabella
began
to
cry
;
but
,
immediately
dashing
the
water
from
her
lashes
,
she
recommenced
.
<EOS>
"
You
asked
,
what
has
driven
me
to
flight
at
last
?
<EOS>
I
was
compelled
to
attempt
it
,
because
I
had
succeeded
in
rousing
his
rage
a
pitch
above
his
malignity
.
<EOS>
Pulling
out
the
nerves
with
red
hot
pincers
requires
more
coolness
than
knocking
on
the
head
.
<EOS>
He
was
worked
up
to
forget
the
fiendish
prudence
he
boasted
of
,
and
proceeded
to
murderous
violence
.
<EOS>
I
experienced
pleasure
in
being
able
to
exasperate
him
:
the
sense
of
pleasure
woke
my
instinct
of
self
-
preservation
,
so
I
fairly
broke
free
;
and
if
ever
I
come
into
his
hands
again
<EOS>
he
is
welcome
to
a
signal
revenge
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yesterday
,
you
know
,
Mr.
Earnshaw
should
have
been
at
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
He
kept
himself
sober
for
the
purpose
 
tolerably
sober
:
not
going
to
bed
mad
at
six
o'clock
and
getting
up
drunk
at
twelve
.
<EOS>
Consequently
,
he
rose
,
in
suicidal
low
spirits
,
as
fit
for
the
church
as
for
a
dance
;
and
instead
,
he
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
swallowed
gin
or
brandy
by
tumblerfuls
.
  
<EOS>
"
Heathcliff
 
<EOS>
I
shudder
to
name
him
!
<EOS>
has
been
a
stranger
in
the
house
from
last
Sunday
till
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
angels
have
fed
him
,
or
his
kin
beneath
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
tell
;
but
he
has
not
eaten
a
meal
with
us
for
nearly
a
week
.
<EOS>
He
has
just
come
home
at
dawn
,
and
gone
up
-
stairs
to
his
chamber
;
locking
himself
in
 
as
if
anybody
dreamt
of
coveting
his
company
!
<EOS>
There
he
has
continued
,
praying
like
a
Methodist
:
only
the
deity
he
implored
is
senseless
dust
and
ashes
;
and
God
,
when
addressed
,
was
curiously
confounded
with
his
own
black
father
!
<EOS>
After
concluding
these
precious
orisons
 
and
they
lasted
generally
till
he
grew
hoarse
and
his
voice
was
strangled
in
his
throat
 
<EOS>
he
would
be
off
again
;
always
straight
down
to
the
Grange
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
Edgar
did
not
send
for
a
constable
,
and
give
him
into
custody
!
<EOS>
For
me
,
grieved
as
I
was
about
Catherine
,
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
regarding
this
season
of
deliverance
from
degrading
oppression
as
a
holiday
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
recovered
spirits
sufficient
to
bear
Joseph
's
eternal
lectures
without
weeping
,
and
to
move
up
and
down
the
house
less
with
the
foot
of
a
frightened
thief
than
formerly
.
<EOS>
You
would
n't
think
that
I
should
cry
at
anything
Joseph
could
say
;
but
he
and
Hareton
are
detestable
companions
.
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
sit
with
Hindley
,
and
hear
his
awful
talk
,
than
with
"
t
'
little
maister
"
and
his
staunch
supporter
,
that
odious
old
man
!
<EOS>
When
Heathcliff
is
in
,
I
'm
often
obliged
to
seek
the
kitchen
and
their
society
,
or
starve
among
the
damp
uninhabited
chambers
;
when
he
is
not
,
as
was
the
case
this
week
,
I
establish
a
table
and
chair
at
one
corner
of
the
house
fire
,
and
never
mind
how
Mr.
Earnshaw
may
occupy
himself
;
and
he
does
not
interfere
with
my
arrangements
.
<EOS>
He
is
quieter
now
than
he
used
to
be
,
if
no
one
provokes
him
:
more
sullen
and
depressed
,
and
less
furious
.
<EOS>
Joseph
affirms
he
's
sure
he
's
an
altered
man
:
<EOS>
that
the
Lord
has
touched
his
heart
,
and
he
is
saved
"
<EOS>
so
as
by
fire
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
puzzled
to
detect
signs
of
the
favourable
change
:
<EOS>
but
it
is
not
my
business
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yester
-
evening
I
sat
in
my
nook
reading
some
old
books
till
late
on
towards
twelve
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
so
dismal
to
go
up
-
stairs
,
with
the
wild
snow
blowing
outside
,
and
my
thoughts
continually
reverting
to
the
kirk
-
yard
and
the
new
-
made
grave
!
<EOS>
I
dared
hardly
lift
my
eyes
from
the
page
before
me
,
that
melancholy
scene
so
instantly
usurped
its
place
.
<EOS>
Hindley
sat
opposite
,
his
head
leant
on
his
hand
;
perhaps
meditating
on
the
same
subject
.
<EOS>
He
had
ceased
drinking
at
a
point
below
irrationality
,
and
had
neither
stirred
nor
spoken
during
two
or
three
hours
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
sound
through
the
house
but
the
moaning
wind
,
which
shook
the
windows
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
the
faint
crackling
of
the
coals
,
and
the
click
of
my
snuffers
as
I
removed
at
intervals
the
long
wick
of
the
candle
.
<EOS>
Hareton
and
Joseph
were
probably
fast
asleep
in
bed
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
,
very
sad
:
and
while
I
read
I
sighed
,
for
it
seemed
as
if
all
joy
had
vanished
from
the
world
,
never
to
be
restored
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
doleful
silence
was
broken
at
length
by
the
sound
of
the
kitchen
latch
:
Heathcliff
had
returned
from
his
watch
earlier
than
usual
;
owing
,
I
suppose
,
to
the
sudden
storm
.
<EOS>
That
entrance
was
fastened
,
and
we
heard
him
coming
round
to
get
in
by
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
rose
with
an
irrepressible
expression
of
what
I
felt
on
my
lips
,
which
induced
my
companion
,
who
had
been
staring
towards
the
door
,
to
turn
and
look
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
'll
keep
him
out
five
minutes
,
"
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
object
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
No
,
you
may
keep
him
out
the
whole
night
for
me
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Do
!
<EOS>
put
the
key
in
the
lock
,
and
draw
the
bolts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Earnshaw
accomplished
this
ere
his
guest
reached
the
front
;
he
then
came
and
brought
his
chair
to
the
other
side
of
my
table
,
leaning
over
it
,
and
searching
in
my
eyes
for
a
sympathy
with
the
burning
hate
that
gleamed
from
his
:
as
he
both
looked
and
felt
like
an
assassin
,
he
could
n't
exactly
find
that
;
but
he
discovered
enough
to
encourage
him
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
You
,
and
I
,
"
he
said
,
"
have
each
a
great
debt
to
settle
with
the
man
out
yonder
!
<EOS>
If
we
were
neither
of
us
cowards
,
we
might
combine
to
discharge
it
.
<EOS>
Are
you
as
soft
as
your
brother
?
<EOS>
Are
you
willing
to
endure
to
the
last
,
and
not
once
attempt
a
repayment
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
'm
weary
of
enduring
now
,
"
I
replied
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
'd
be
glad
of
a
retaliation
that
would
n't
recoil
on
myself
;
but
treachery
and
violence
are
spears
pointed
at
both
ends
;
they
wound
those
who
resort
to
them
worse
than
their
enemies
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
Treachery
and
violence
are
a
just
return
for
treachery
and
violence
!
"
cried
Hindley
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
I
'll
ask
you
to
do
nothing
;
but
sit
still
and
be
dumb
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
now
,
can
you
?
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
you
would
have
as
much
pleasure
as
I
in
witnessing
the
conclusion
of
the
fiend
's
existence
;
he
'll
be
_
your
_
death
unless
you
overreach
him
;
and
he
'll
be
_
<EOS>
my
_
ruin
.
<EOS>
Damn
the
hellish
villain
!
<EOS>
He
knocks
at
the
door
as
if
he
were
master
here
already
!
<EOS>
Promise
to
hold
your
tongue
,
and
before
that
clock
strikes
 
<EOS>
it
wants
three
minutes
of
one
 
<EOS>
you
're
a
free
woman
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
took
the
implements
which
I
described
to
you
in
my
letter
from
his
breast
,
and
would
have
turned
down
the
candle
.
<EOS>
I
snatched
it
away
,
however
,
and
seized
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
'll
not
hold
my
tongue
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
;
"
you
must
n't
touch
him
.
<EOS>
Let
the
door
remain
shut
,
and
be
quiet
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
No
!
<EOS>
I
've
formed
my
resolution
,
and
by
God
I
'll
execute
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
desperate
being
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
do
you
a
kindness
in
spite
of
yourself
,
and
Hareton
justice
!
<EOS>
And
you
need
n't
trouble
your
head
to
screen
me
;
Catherine
is
gone
.
<EOS>
Nobody
alive
would
regret
me
,
or
be
ashamed
,
though
I
cut
my
throat
this
minute
 
<EOS>
and
it
's
time
to
make
an
end
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
might
as
well
have
struggled
with
a
bear
,
or
reasoned
with
a
lunatic
.
<EOS>
The
only
resource
left
me
was
to
run
to
a
lattice
and
warn
his
intended
victim
of
the
fate
which
awaited
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
You
'd
better
seek
shelter
somewhere
else
to
-
night
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
,
in
rather
a
triumphant
tone
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Earnshaw
has
a
mind
to
shoot
you
,
if
you
persist
in
endeavouring
to
enter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
You
'd
better
open
the
door
,
you
 
<EOS>
"
he
answered
,
addressing
me
by
some
elegant
term
that
I
do
n't
care
to
repeat
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
shall
not
meddle
in
the
matter
,
"
I
retorted
again
.
<EOS>
"
Come
in
and
get
shot
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
've
done
my
duty
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
With
that
I
shut
the
window
and
returned
to
my
place
by
the
fire
;
having
too
small
a
stock
of
hypocrisy
at
my
command
to
pretend
any
anxiety
for
the
danger
that
menaced
him
.
<EOS>
Earnshaw
swore
passionately
at
me
:
affirming
that
I
loved
the
villain
yet
;
and
calling
me
all
sorts
of
names
for
the
base
spirit
I
evinced
.
<EOS>
And
I
,
in
my
secret
heart
(
and
conscience
never
reproached
me
)
,
thought
what
a
blessing
it
would
be
for
_
him
<EOS>
_
should
Heathcliff
put
him
out
of
misery
;
and
what
a
blessing
for
_
me
_
<EOS>
should
he
send
Heathcliff
to
his
right
abode
!
<EOS>
As
I
sat
nursing
these
reflections
,
the
casement
behind
me
was
banged
on
to
the
floor
by
a
blow
from
the
latter
individual
,
and
his
black
countenance
looked
blightingly
through
.
<EOS>
The
stanchions
stood
too
close
to
suffer
his
shoulders
to
follow
,
and
I
smiled
,
exulting
in
my
fancied
security
.
<EOS>
His
hair
and
clothes
were
whitened
with
snow
,
and
his
sharp
cannibal
teeth
,
revealed
by
cold
and
wrath
,
gleamed
through
the
dark
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Isabella
,
let
me
in
,
or
I
'll
make
you
repent
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
"
girned
,
"
as
Joseph
calls
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
can
not
commit
murder
,
"
I
replied
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Hindley
stands
sentinel
with
a
knife
and
loaded
pistol
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Let
me
in
by
the
kitchen
door
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Hindley
will
be
there
before
me
,
"
<EOS>
I
answered
:
"
and
that
's
a
poor
love
of
yours
that
can
not
bear
a
shower
of
snow
!
<EOS>
We
were
left
at
peace
in
our
beds
as
long
as
the
summer
moon
shone
,
but
the
moment
a
blast
of
winter
returns
,
you
must
run
for
shelter
!
<EOS>
Heathcliff
,
if
I
were
you
,
I
'd
go
stretch
myself
over
her
grave
and
die
like
a
faithful
dog
.
<EOS>
The
world
is
surely
not
worth
living
in
now
,
is
it
?
<EOS>
You
had
distinctly
impressed
on
me
the
idea
that
Catherine
was
the
whole
joy
of
your
life
:
I
ca
n't
imagine
how
you
think
of
surviving
her
loss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
He
's
there
,
is
he
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
my
companion
,
rushing
to
the
gap
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
can
get
my
arm
out
I
can
hit
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
,
Ellen
,
you
'll
set
me
down
as
really
wicked
;
but
you
do
n't
know
all
,
so
do
n't
judge
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
aided
or
abetted
an
attempt
on
even
_
his
_
life
for
anything
.
<EOS>
Wish
that
he
were
dead
,
I
must
;
and
therefore
I
was
fearfully
disappointed
,
and
unnerved
by
terror
for
the
consequences
of
my
taunting
speech
,
when
he
flung
himself
on
Earnshaw
's
weapon
and
wrenched
it
from
his
grasp
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
charge
exploded
,
and
the
knife
,
in
springing
back
,
closed
into
its
owner
's
wrist
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
pulled
it
away
by
main
force
,
slitting
up
the
flesh
as
it
passed
on
,
and
thrust
it
dripping
into
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
He
then
took
a
stone
,
struck
down
the
division
between
two
windows
,
and
sprang
in
.
<EOS>
His
adversary
had
fallen
senseless
with
excessive
pain
and
the
flow
of
blood
,
that
gushed
from
an
artery
or
a
large
vein
.
<EOS>
The
ruffian
kicked
and
trampled
on
him
,
and
dashed
his
head
repeatedly
against
the
flags
,
holding
me
with
one
hand
,
meantime
,
to
prevent
me
summoning
Joseph
.
<EOS>
He
exerted
preterhuman
self
-
denial
in
abstaining
from
finishing
him
completely
;
but
getting
out
of
breath
,
he
finally
desisted
,
and
dragged
the
apparently
inanimate
body
on
to
the
settle
.
<EOS>
There
he
tore
off
the
sleeve
of
Earnshaw
's
coat
,
and
bound
up
the
wound
with
brutal
roughness
;
spitting
and
cursing
during
the
operation
as
energetically
as
he
had
kicked
before
.
<EOS>
Being
at
liberty
,
I
lost
no
time
in
seeking
the
old
servant
;
who
,
having
gathered
by
degrees
the
purport
of
my
hasty
tale
,
hurried
below
,
gasping
,
as
he
descended
the
steps
two
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
What
is
ther
to
do
,
now
?
<EOS>
what
is
ther
to
do
,
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
There
's
this
to
do
,
"
thundered
Heathcliff
,
"
that
your
master
's
mad
;
and
should
he
last
another
month
,
I
'll
have
him
to
an
asylum
.
<EOS>
And
how
the
devil
did
you
come
to
fasten
me
out
<EOS>
,
you
toothless
hound
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
stand
muttering
and
mumbling
there
.
<EOS>
Come
,
I
'm
not
going
to
nurse
him
.
<EOS>
Wash
that
stuff
away
;
and
mind
the
sparks
of
your
candle
 
<EOS>
it
is
more
than
half
brandy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
And
so
ye've
been
murthering
on
him
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Joseph
,
lifting
his
hands
and
eyes
in
horror
.
<EOS>
"
If
iver
I
seed
a
seeght
loike
this
!
<EOS>
May
the
Lord
 
"
  
"
Heathcliff
gave
him
a
push
on
to
his
knees
in
the
middle
of
the
blood
,
and
flung
a
towel
to
him
;
but
instead
of
proceeding
to
dry
it
up
,
he
joined
his
hands
and
began
a
prayer
,
which
excited
my
laughter
from
its
odd
phraseology
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
the
condition
of
mind
to
be
shocked
at
nothing
:
in
fact
,
I
was
as
reckless
as
some
malefactors
show
themselves
at
the
foot
of
the
gallows
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Oh
,
I
forgot
you
,
"
said
the
tyrant
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
do
that
.
<EOS>
Down
with
you
.
<EOS>
And
you
conspire
with
him
against
me
,
do
you
,
viper
?
<EOS>
There
,
that
is
work
fit
for
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
shook
me
till
my
teeth
rattled
,
and
pitched
me
beside
Joseph
,
who
steadily
concluded
his
supplications
,
and
then
rose
,
vowing
he
would
set
off
for
the
Grange
directly
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
was
a
magistrate
,
and
though
he
had
fifty
wives
dead
,
he
should
inquire
into
this
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
obstinate
in
his
resolution
,
that
Heathcliff
deemed
it
expedient
to
compel
from
my
lips
a
recapitulation
of
what
had
taken
place
;
standing
over
me
,
heaving
with
malevolence
,
as
I
reluctantly
delivered
the
account
in
answer
to
his
questions
.
<EOS>
It
required
a
great
deal
of
labour
to
satisfy
the
old
man
that
Heathcliff
was
not
the
aggressor
;
especially
with
my
hardly
-
wrung
replies
.
<EOS>
However
,
Mr.
Earnshaw
soon
convinced
him
that
he
was
alive
still
;
Joseph
hastened
to
administer
a
dose
of
spirits
,
and
by
their
succour
his
master
presently
regained
motion
and
consciousness
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
,
aware
that
his
opponent
was
ignorant
of
the
treatment
received
while
insensible
,
called
him
deliriously
intoxicated
;
and
said
he
should
not
notice
his
atrocious
conduct
further
,
but
advised
him
to
get
to
bed
.
<EOS>
To
my
joy
,
he
left
us
,
after
giving
this
judicious
counsel
,
and
Hindley
stretched
himself
on
the
hearthstone
.
<EOS>
I
departed
to
my
own
room
,
marvelling
that
I
had
escaped
so
easily
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
morning
,
when
I
came
down
,
about
half
an
hour
before
noon
,
Mr.
Earnshaw
was
sitting
by
the
fire
,
deadly
sick
;
his
evil
genius
,
almost
as
gaunt
and
ghastly
,
leant
against
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
Neither
appeared
inclined
to
dine
,
and
,
having
waited
till
all
was
cold
on
the
table
,
I
commenced
alone
.
<EOS>
Nothing
hindered
me
from
eating
heartily
,
and
I
experienced
a
certain
sense
of
satisfaction
and
superiority
,
as
,
at
intervals
,
I
cast
a
look
towards
my
silent
companions
,
and
felt
the
comfort
of
a
quiet
conscience
within
me
.
<EOS>
After
I
had
done
,
I
ventured
on
the
unusual
liberty
of
drawing
near
the
fire
,
going
round
Earnshaw
's
seat
,
and
kneeling
in
the
corner
beside
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Heathcliff
did
not
glance
my
way
,
and
I
gazed
up
,
and
contemplated
his
features
almost
as
confidently
as
if
they
had
been
turned
to
stone
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
,
that
I
once
thought
so
manly
,
and
that
I
now
think
so
diabolical
,
was
shaded
with
a
heavy
cloud
;
his
basilisk
eyes
were
nearly
quenched
by
sleeplessness
,
and
weeping
,
perhaps
,
for
the
lashes
<EOS>
were
wet
then
:
his
lips
devoid
of
their
ferocious
sneer
,
and
sealed
in
an
expression
of
unspeakable
sadness
.
<EOS>
Had
it
been
another
,
I
would
have
covered
my
face
in
the
presence
of
such
grief
.
<EOS>
In
_
his
_
case
,
I
was
gratified
;
and
,
ignoble
as
it
seems
to
insult
a
fallen
enemy
,
I
could
n't
miss
this
chance
of
sticking
in
a
dart
:
<EOS>
his
weakness
was
the
only
time
when
I
could
taste
the
delight
of
paying
wrong
for
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fie
,
fie
,
Miss
!
<EOS>
"
I
interrupted
.
<EOS>
"
One
might
suppose
you
had
never
opened
a
Bible
in
your
life
.
<EOS>
If
God
afflict
your
enemies
,
surely
that
ought
to
suffice
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
both
mean
and
presumptuous
to
add
your
torture
to
his
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
general
I
'll
allow
that
it
would
be
,
Ellen
,
"
she
continued
;
"
but
what
misery
laid
on
Heathcliff
could
content
me
,
unless
I
have
a
hand
in
it
?
<EOS>
I
'd
<EOS>
rather
he
suffered
less
,
if
I
might
cause
his
sufferings
and
<EOS>
he
might
_
know
_
that
I
was
the
cause
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
owe
him
so
much
.
<EOS>
On
only
one
condition
can
I
hope
to
forgive
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
if
I
may
take
an
eye
for
an
eye
,
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
;
for
every
wrench
of
agony
return
a
wrench
:
reduce
him
to
my
level
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
the
first
to
injure
,
make
him
the
first
to
implore
pardon
;
and
then
 
why
then
,
Ellen
,
I
might
show
you
some
generosity
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
utterly
impossible
I
can
ever
be
revenged
,
and
therefore
I
can
not
forgive
him
.
<EOS>
Hindley
wanted
some
water
,
and
I
handed
him
a
glass
,
and
asked
him
how
he
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Not
as
ill
as
I
wish
,
"
he
replied
.
"
<EOS>
But
leaving
out
my
arm
,
every
inch
of
me
is
as
sore
as
if
I
had
been
fighting
with
a
legion
of
imps
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Yes
,
no
wonder
,
"
was
my
next
remark
.
<EOS>
"
Catherine
used
to
boast
that
she
stood
between
you
and
bodily
harm
:
she
meant
that
certain
persons
would
not
hurt
you
for
fear
of
offending
her
.
<EOS>
It
's
well
<EOS>
people
do
n't
_
really
_
rise
from
their
grave
,
or
,
last
night
,
she
might
have
witnessed
a
repulsive
scene
!
<EOS>
Are
not
you
bruised
,
and
cut
over
your
chest
and
shoulders
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
I
ca
n't
say
,
"
he
answered
,
"
but
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
Did
he
dare
to
strike
me
when
I
was
down
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
"
He
trampled
on
and
kicked
you
,
and
dashed
you
on
the
ground
,
"
I
whispered
.
"
<EOS>
And
his
mouth
watered
to
tear
you
with
his
teeth
;
because
he
's
only
half
man
:
not
so
much
,
and
the
rest
fiend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Earnshaw
looked
up
,
like
me
,
to
the
countenance
of
our
mutual
foe
;
who
,
absorbed
in
his
anguish
,
seemed
insensible
to
anything
around
him
:
the
longer
he
stood
,
the
plainer
his
reflections
revealed
their
blackness
through
his
features
.
  
"
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
if
God
would
but
give
me
strength
to
strangle
him
in
my
last
agony
,
I
'd
go
to
hell
with
joy
,
"
groaned
the
impatient
man
,
writhing
to
rise
,
and
sinking
back
in
despair
,
convinced
of
his
inadequacy
for
the
struggle
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Nay
,
it
's
enough
that
he
has
murdered
one
of
you
,
"
I
observed
aloud
.
"
<EOS>
At
the
Grange
,
every
one
knows
your
sister
would
have
been
living
now
<EOS>
had
it
not
been
for
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
it
is
preferable
to
be
hated
than
loved
by
him
.
<EOS>
When
I
recollect
how
happy
we
were
 
<EOS>
how
happy
Catherine
was
before
he
came
 
<EOS>
I
'm
fit
to
curse
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Most
likely
,
Heathcliff
noticed
more
the
truth
of
what
was
said
,
than
the
spirit
of
the
person
who
said
it
.
<EOS>
His
attention
was
roused
,
I
saw
,
for
his
eyes
rained
down
tears
among
the
ashes
,
and
he
drew
his
breath
in
suffocating
sighs
.
<EOS>
I
stared
full
at
him
,
and
laughed
scornfully
.
<EOS>
The
clouded
windows
of
hell
flashed
a
moment
towards
me
;
the
fiend
which
usually
looked
out
,
however
,
was
so
dimmed
and
drowned
that
I
did
not
fear
to
hazard
another
sound
of
derision
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Get
up
,
and
begone
out
of
my
sight
,
"
said
the
mourner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
guessed
he
uttered
those
words
,
at
least
,
though
his
voice
was
hardly
intelligible
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
loved
Catherine
too
;
and
her
brother
requires
attendance
,
which
,
for
her
sake
,
I
shall
supply
.
<EOS>
Now
,
that
she
's
dead
,
I
see
her
in
Hindley
:
Hindley
has
exactly
her
eyes
,
if
you
had
not
tried
to
gouge
them
out
,
and
made
them
black
and
red
;
and
her
 
"
  
"
"
Get
up
,
wretched
idiot
,
before
I
stamp
you
to
death
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
making
a
movement
that
caused
me
to
make
one
also
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
But
then
,
"
I
continued
,
holding
myself
ready
to
flee
,
"
if
poor
Catherine
had
trusted
you
,
and
assumed
the
ridiculous
,
contemptible
,
degrading
title
of
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
she
would
soon
have
presented
a
similar
picture
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
would
n't
have
borne
your
abominable
behaviour
quietly
:
her
detestation
and
disgust
must
have
found
voice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
back
of
the
settle
and
Earnshaw
's
person
interposed
between
me
and
him
;
so
instead
of
endeavouring
to
reach
me
,
he
snatched
a
dinner
-
knife
from
the
table
and
flung
it
at
my
head
.
<EOS>
It
struck
beneath
my
ear
,
and
stopped
the
sentence
I
was
uttering
;
but
,
pulling
it
out
,
I
sprang
to
the
door
and
delivered
another
;
which
I
hope
went
a
little
deeper
than
his
missile
.
<EOS>
The
last
glimpse
I
caught
of
him
was
a
furious
rush
on
his
part
,
checked
by
the
embrace
of
his
host
;
and
both
fell
locked
together
on
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
In
my
flight
through
the
kitchen
I
bid
Joseph
speed
to
his
master
;
I
knocked
over
Hareton
,
who
was
hanging
a
litter
of
puppies
from
a
chair
-
back
in
the
doorway
;
and
,
blessed
as
a
soul
escaped
from
purgatory
,
I
bounded
,
leaped
,
and
flew
down
the
steep
road
;
then
,
quitting
its
windings
,
shot
direct
across
the
moor
,
rolling
over
banks
,
and
wading
through
marshes
:
precipitating
myself
,
in
fact
,
towards
the
beacon
-
light
of
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
And
far
rather
would
I
be
condemned
to
a
perpetual
dwelling
in
the
infernal
regions
than
,
even
for
one
night
,
abide
beneath
the
roof
of
Wuthering
Heights
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Isabella
ceased
speaking
,
and
took
a
drink
of
tea
;
then
she
rose
,
and
bidding
me
put
on
her
bonnet
,
and
a
great
shawl
I
had
brought
,
and
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
my
entreaties
for
her
to
remain
another
hour
,
she
stepped
on
to
a
chair
,
kissed
Edgar
's
and
Catherine
's
portraits
,
bestowed
a
similar
salute
on
me
,
and
descended
to
the
carriage
,
accompanied
by
Fanny
,
who
yelped
wild
with
joy
at
recovering
her
mistress
.
<EOS>
She
was
driven
away
,
never
to
revisit
this
neighbourhood
:
but
a
regular
correspondence
was
established
between
her
and
my
master
when
things
were
more
settled
.
<EOS>
I
believe
her
new
abode
was
in
the
south
,
near
London
;
there
she
had
a
son
born
a
few
months
subsequent
to
her
escape
.
<EOS>
He
was
christened
Linton
,
and
,
from
the
first
,
she
reported
him
to
be
an
ailing
,
peevish
creature
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
meeting
me
one
day
in
the
village
,
inquired
where
she
lived
.
<EOS>
I
refused
to
tell
.
<EOS>
He
remarked
that
it
was
not
of
any
moment
,
only
she
must
beware
of
coming
to
her
brother
:
she
should
not
be
with
him
,
if
he
had
to
keep
her
himself
.
<EOS>
Though
I
would
give
no
information
,
he
discovered
,
through
some
of
the
other
servants
,
both
her
place
of
residence
and
the
existence
of
the
child
.
<EOS>
Still
,
he
did
n't
molest
her
:
for
which
forbearance
she
might
thank
his
aversion
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
He
often
asked
about
the
infant
,
when
he
saw
me
;
and
on
hearing
its
name
,
smiled
grimly
,
and
observed
:
"
They
wish
me
to
hate
it
too
,
do
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
they
wish
you
to
know
anything
about
it
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
'll
have
it
,
"
he
said
,
"
when
I
want
it
.
<EOS>
They
may
reckon
on
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
Fortunately
its
mother
died
before
the
time
arrived
;
some
thirteen
years
after
the
decease
of
Catherine
,
when
Linton
was
twelve
,
or
a
little
more
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
day
succeeding
Isabella
's
unexpected
visit
I
had
no
opportunity
of
speaking
to
my
master
:
he
shunned
conversation
,
and
was
fit
for
discussing
nothing
.
<EOS>
When
I
could
get
him
to
listen
,
I
saw
it
pleased
him
that
his
sister
had
left
her
husband
;
whom
he
abhorred
with
an
intensity
which
the
mildness
of
his
nature
would
scarcely
seem
to
allow
.
<EOS>
So
deep
and
sensitive
was
his
aversion
,
that
he
refrained
from
going
anywhere
where
he
was
likely
to
see
or
hear
of
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
Grief
,
and
that
together
,
transformed
him
into
a
complete
hermit
:
he
threw
up
his
office
of
magistrate
,
ceased
even
to
attend
church
,
avoided
the
village
on
all
occasions
,
and
spent
a
life
of
entire
seclusion
within
the
limits
of
his
park
and
grounds
;
only
varied
by
solitary
rambles
on
the
moors
,
and
visits
to
the
grave
of
his
wife
,
mostly
at
evening
,
or
early
morning
before
other
wanderers
were
abroad
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
too
good
to
be
thoroughly
unhappy
long
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
did
n't
pray
for
Catherine
's
soul
to
haunt
him
.
<EOS>
Time
brought
resignation
,
and
a
melancholy
sweeter
than
common
joy
.
<EOS>
He
recalled
her
memory
with
ardent
,
tender
love
,
and
hopeful
aspiring
to
the
better
world
;
where
he
doubted
not
she
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
And
he
had
earthly
consolation
and
affections
also
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
days
,
I
said
,
he
seemed
regardless
of
the
puny
successor
to
the
departed
:
that
coldness
melted
as
fast
as
snow
in
April
,
and
ere
the
tiny
thing
could
stammer
a
word
or
totter
a
step
<EOS>
it
wielded
a
despot
's
sceptre
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
It
was
named
Catherine
;
but
he
never
called
it
the
name
in
full
,
as
he
had
never
called
the
first
Catherine
short
:
probably
because
Heathcliff
had
a
habit
of
doing
so
.
<EOS>
The
little
one
was
always
Cathy
:
<EOS>
it
formed
to
him
a
distinction
from
the
mother
,
and
yet
a
connection
with
her
;
and
his
attachment
sprang
from
its
relation
to
her
,
far
more
than
from
its
being
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
I
used
to
draw
a
comparison
between
him
and
Hindley
Earnshaw
,
and
perplex
myself
to
explain
satisfactorily
why
their
conduct
was
so
opposite
in
similar
circumstances
.
<EOS>
They
had
both
been
fond
husbands
,
and
were
both
attached
to
their
children
;
and
I
could
not
see
how
they
should
n't
both
have
taken
the
same
road
,
for
good
or
evil
.
<EOS>
But
,
I
thought
in
my
mind
,
Hindley
,
with
apparently
the
stronger
head
,
has
shown
himself
sadly
the
worse
and
the
weaker
man
.
<EOS>
When
his
ship
struck
,
the
captain
abandoned
his
post
;
and
the
crew
,
instead
of
trying
to
save
her
,
rushed
into
riot
and
confusion
,
leaving
no
hope
for
their
luckless
vessel
.
<EOS>
Linton
,
on
the
contrary
,
displayed
the
true
courage
of
a
loyal
and
faithful
soul
:
he
trusted
God
;
and
God
comforted
him
.
<EOS>
One
hoped
,
and
the
other
despaired
:
<EOS>
they
chose
their
own
lots
,
and
were
righteously
doomed
to
endure
them
.
<EOS>
But
you
'll
not
want
to
hear
my
moralising
,
Mr.
Lockwood
;
you
'll
judge
,
as
well
as
I
can
,
all
these
things
:
at
least
,
you
'll
think
you
will
,
and
that
's
the
same
.
<EOS>
The
end
of
Earnshaw
was
what
might
have
been
expected
;
it
followed
fast
on
his
sister
's
:
there
were
scarcely
six
months
between
them
.
<EOS>
We
,
at
the
Grange
,
never
got
a
very
succinct
account
of
his
state
preceding
it
;
all
that
I
did
learn
was
on
occasion
of
going
to
aid
in
the
preparations
for
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kenneth
came
to
announce
the
event
to
my
master
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Nelly
,
"
said
he
,
riding
into
the
yard
one
morning
,
too
early
not
to
alarm
me
with
an
instant
presentiment
of
bad
news
,
"
it
's
yours
and
my
turn
to
go
into
mourning
at
present
.
<EOS>
Who
's
given
us
the
slip
now
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
<EOS>
I
asked
in
a
flurry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
guess
!
"
<EOS>
he
returned
,
dismounting
,
and
slinging
his
bridle
on
a
hook
by
the
door
.
"
<EOS>
And
nip
up
the
corner
of
your
apron
<EOS>
:
I
'm
certain
you
'll
need
it
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
surely
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
would
you
have
tears
for
him
?
"
said
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
Heathcliff
's
a
tough
young
fellow
<EOS>
:
he
looks
blooming
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
've
just
seen
him
.
<EOS>
He
's
rapidly
regaining
flesh
since
he
lost
his
better
half
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
,
then
,
Mr.
Kenneth
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hindley
Earnshaw
!
<EOS>
Your
old
friend
Hindley
,
"
he
replied
,
"
and
my
wicked
gossip
:
though
he
's
been
too
wild
for
me
this
long
while
.
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
I
said
we
should
draw
water
.
<EOS>
But
cheer
up
!
<EOS>
He
died
true
to
his
character
:
drunk
as
a
lord
.
<EOS>
Poor
lad
!
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
,
too
.
<EOS>
One
ca
n't
help
missing
an
old
companion
:
though
he
had
the
worst
tricks
with
him
that
ever
man
imagined
,
and
has
done
me
many
a
rascally
turn
.
<EOS>
He
's
barely
twenty
-
seven
<EOS>
,
it
seems
;
that
's
your
own
age
:
who
would
have
thought
you
were
born
in
one
year
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
confess
this
blow
was
greater
to
me
than
the
shock
of
Mrs.
Linton
's
death
:
ancient
associations
lingered
round
my
heart
;
I
sat
down
in
the
porch
and
wept
as
for
a
blood
relation
,
desiring
Mr.
Kenneth
to
get
another
servant
to
introduce
him
to
the
master
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
hinder
myself
from
pondering
on
the
question
 
<EOS>
"
Had
he
had
fair
play

Whatever
I
did
,
that
idea
would
bother
me
:
it
was
so
tiresomely
pertinacious
that
I
resolved
on
requesting
leave
to
go
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
and
assist
in
the
last
duties
to
the
dead
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
was
extremely
reluctant
to
consent
,
but
I
pleaded
eloquently
for
the
friendless
condition
in
which
he
lay
;
and
I
said
my
old
master
and
foster
-
brother
had
a
claim
on
my
services
as
strong
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
reminded
him
that
the
child
Hareton
was
his
wife
's
nephew
,
and
,
in
the
absence
of
nearer
kin
,
he
ought
to
act
as
its
guardian
;
and
he
ought
to
and
must
inquire
how
the
property
was
left
,
and
look
over
the
concerns
of
his
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
He
was
unfit
for
attending
to
such
matters
then
,
but
he
bid
me
speak
to
his
lawyer
;
and
at
length
permitted
me
to
go
.
<EOS>
His
lawyer
had
been
Earnshaw
's
also
:
I
called
at
the
village
,
and
asked
him
to
accompany
me
.
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
,
and
advised
that
Heathcliff
should
be
let
alone
;
affirming
,
if
the
truth
were
known
,
Hareton
would
be
found
little
else
than
a
beggar
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
father
died
in
debt
,
"
he
said
;
"
the
whole
property
is
mortgaged
,
and
the
sole
chance
for
the
natural
heir
is
to
allow
him
an
opportunity
of
creating
some
interest
in
the
creditor
's
heart
,
that
he
may
be
inclined
to
deal
leniently
towards
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
When
I
reached
the
Heights
,
I
explained
that
I
had
come
to
see
everything
carried
on
decently
;
and
Joseph
,
who
appeared
in
sufficient
distress
,
expressed
satisfaction
at
my
presence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
said
he
did
not
perceive
that
I
was
wanted
;
but
I
might
stay
and
order
the
arrangements
for
the
funeral
,
if
I
chose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Correctly
,
"
he
remarked
,
"
that
fool
's
body
should
be
buried
at
the
cross
-
roads
,
without
ceremony
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
I
happened
to
leave
him
ten
minutes
yesterday
afternoon
,
and
in
that
interval
he
fastened
the
two
doors
of
the
house
against
me
,
and
he
has
spent
the
night
in
drinking
himself
to
death
deliberately
!
<EOS>
We
broke
in
this
morning
,
for
we
heard
him
sporting
like
a
horse
;
and
there
he
was
,
laid
over
the
settle
:
flaying
and
scalping
would
not
have
wakened
him
.
<EOS>
I
sent
for
Kenneth
,
and
he
came
;
but
not
till
the
beast
had
changed
into
carrion
<EOS>
:
he
was
both
dead
and
cold
,
and
stark
;
and
so
you
'll
allow
it
was
useless
making
more
stir
about
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
servant
confirmed
this
statement
,
but
muttered
:
  
"
I
'd
rayther
he
'd
goan
hisseln
for
t
'
doctor
!
<EOS>
I
sud
ha
'
taen
tent
o
'
t
'
maister
better
nor
him
 
and
he
warn't
<EOS>
deead
when
I
left
<EOS>
,
naught
o
'
t
'
soart
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
insisted
on
the
funeral
being
respectable
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
said
I
might
have
my
own
way
there
too
:
only
,
he
desired
me
to
remember
that
the
money
for
the
whole
affair
came
out
of
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
He
maintained
a
hard
,
careless
deportment
,
indicative
of
neither
joy
nor
sorrow
:
if
anything
,
it
expressed
a
flinty
gratification
at
a
piece
of
difficult
work
successfully
executed
.
<EOS>
I
observed
once
,
indeed
,
something
like
exultation
in
his
aspect
:
it
was
just
when
the
people
were
bearing
the
coffin
from
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
hypocrisy
to
represent
a
mourner
:
and
previous
to
following
with
Hareton
,
he
lifted
the
unfortunate
child
on
to
the
table
and
muttered
,
with
peculiar
gusto
,
"
Now
,
my
bonny
lad
,
you
are
_
mine
_
!
<EOS>
And
we
'll
see
if
one
tree
wo
n't
grow
as
crooked
as
another
,
with
the
same
wind
to
twist
it
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
unsuspecting
thing
was
pleased
at
this
speech
:
he
played
with
Heathcliff
's
whiskers
,
and
stroked
his
cheek
;
but
I
divined
its
meaning
,
and
observed
tartly
,
"
That
boy
must
go
back
with
me
to
Thrushcross
Grange
,
sir
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
in
the
world
less
yours
than
he
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
Linton
say
so
?
<EOS>
"
he
demanded
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
 
he
has
ordered
me
to
take
him
,
"
I
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
the
scoundrel
,
"
we
'll
not
argue
the
subject
now
:
<EOS>
but
I
have
a
fancy
to
try
my
hand
at
rearing
a
young
one
;
so
intimate
to
your
master
that
I
must
supply
the
place
of
this
with
my
own
,
if
he
attempt
to
remove
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
engage
to
let
Hareton
go
undisputed
;
but
I
'll
be
pretty
sure
to
make
the
other
come
!
<EOS>
Remember
to
tell
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
hint
was
enough
to
bind
our
hands
.
<EOS>
I
repeated
its
substance
on
my
return
;
and
Edgar
Linton
,
little
interested
at
the
commencement
,
spoke
no
more
of
interfering
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
aware
that
he
could
have
done
it
to
any
purpose
,
had
he
been
ever
so
willing
.
  
<EOS>
The
guest
was
now
the
master
of
Wuthering
Heights
:
he
held
firm
possession
,
and
proved
to
the
attorney
 
who
,
in
his
turn
,
proved
it
to
Mr.
Linton
 
that
Earnshaw
had
mortgaged
every
yard
of
land
he
owned
for
cash
to
supply
his
mania
for
gaming
;
and
he
,
Heathcliff
,
was
the
mortgagee
.
<EOS>
In
that
manner
Hareton
,
who
should
now
be
the
first
gentleman
in
the
neighbourhood
,
was
reduced
to
a
state
of
complete
dependence
on
his
father
's
inveterate
enemy
;
and
lives
in
his
own
house
as
a
servant
,
deprived
of
the
advantage
of
wages
:
quite
unable
to
right
himself
,
because
of
his
friendlessness
,
and
his
ignorance
that
he
has
been
wronged
.
    
<EOS>
The
twelve
years
,
continued
Mrs.
Dean
,
following
that
dismal
period
were
the
happiest
of
my
life
:
my
greatest
troubles
in
their
passage
rose
from
our
little
lady
's
trifling
illnesses
,
which
she
had
to
experience
in
common
with
all
children
,
rich
and
poor
.
<EOS>
For
the
rest
,
after
the
first
six
months
,
she
grew
like
a
larch
,
and
could
walk
and
talk
too
,
in
her
own
way
,
before
the
heath
blossomed
a
second
time
over
Mrs.
Linton
's
dust
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
most
winning
thing
that
ever
brought
sunshine
into
a
desolate
house
:
a
real
beauty
in
face
,
with
the
Earnshaws
'
handsome
dark
eyes
,
but
the
Lintons
'
fair
skin
and
small
features
,
and
yellow
curling
hair
.
<EOS>
Her
spirit
was
high
,
though
not
rough
,
and
qualified
by
a
heart
sensitive
and
lively
to
excess
in
its
affections
.
<EOS>
That
capacity
for
intense
attachments
reminded
me
of
her
mother
:
still
she
did
not
resemble
her
:
<EOS>
for
she
could
be
soft
and
mild
as
a
dove
,
and
she
had
a
gentle
voice
and
pensive
expression
:
her
anger
was
never
furious
;
her
love
never
fierce
<EOS>
:
it
was
deep
and
tender
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
must
be
acknowledged
,
she
had
faults
to
foil
her
gifts
.
<EOS>
A
propensity
to
be
saucy
was
one
;
and
a
perverse
will
,
that
indulged
children
invariably
acquire
,
whether
they
be
good
tempered
or
cross
.
<EOS>
If
a
servant
chanced
to
vex
her
,
it
was
always
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
tell
papa
!
"
<EOS>
And
if
he
reproved
her
,
even
by
a
look
,
you
would
have
thought
it
a
heart
-
breaking
business
<EOS>
:
I
do
n't
believe
he
ever
did
speak
a
harsh
word
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
took
her
education
entirely
on
himself
,
and
made
it
an
amusement
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
curiosity
and
a
quick
intellect
made
her
an
apt
scholar
:
she
learned
rapidly
and
eagerly
,
and
did
honour
to
his
teaching
.
  
<EOS>
Till
she
reached
the
age
of
thirteen
<EOS>
she
had
not
once
been
beyond
the
range
of
the
park
by
herself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
would
take
her
with
him
a
mile
or
so
outside
,
on
rare
occasions
;
but
he
trusted
her
to
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
Gimmerton
was
an
unsubstantial
name
in
her
ears
;
the
chapel
,
the
only
building
she
had
approached
or
entered
,
except
her
own
home
.
<EOS>
Wuthering
Heights
and
Mr.
Heathcliff
did
not
exist
for
her
:
she
was
a
perfect
recluse
;
and
,
apparently
,
perfectly
contented
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
indeed
,
while
surveying
the
country
from
her
nursery
window
,
she
would
observe
    
"
Ellen
<EOS>
,
how
long
will
it
be
before
I
can
walk
to
the
top
of
those
hills
?
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
lies
on
the
other
side
 
is
it
the
sea
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
Miss
Cathy
,
"
I
would
answer
;
"
it
is
hills
again
,
just
like
these
.
"
  
"
And
what
are
those
golden
rocks
like
<EOS>
when
you
stand
under
them
?
<EOS>
"
she
once
asked
.
  
<EOS>
The
abrupt
descent
of
Penistone
Crags
particularly
attracted
her
notice
;
especially
when
the
setting
sun
shone
on
it
and
the
topmost
heights
,
and
the
whole
extent
of
landscape
besides
lay
in
shadow
.
<EOS>
I
explained
that
they
were
bare
masses
of
stone
,
with
hardly
enough
earth
in
their
clefts
to
nourish
a
stunted
tree
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
are
they
bright
so
long
after
it
is
evening
here
?
<EOS>
"
she
pursued
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
they
are
a
great
deal
higher
up
than
we
are
,
"
replied
I
;
"
you
could
not
climb
them
,
they
are
too
high
and
steep
.
<EOS>
In
winter
the
frost
is
always
there
before
it
comes
to
us
;
and
deep
into
summer
I
have
found
snow
under
that
black
hollow
on
the
north
-
east
side
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
have
been
on
them
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
gleefully
.
"
<EOS>
Then
I
can
go
,
too
,
when
I
am
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Has
papa
been
,
Ellen
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
would
tell
you
,
Miss
,
"
I
answered
,
hastily
,
"
that
they
are
not
worth
the
trouble
of
visiting
.
<EOS>
The
moors
,
where
you
ramble
with
him
,
are
much
nicer
;
and
Thrushcross
Park
is
the
finest
place
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
know
the
park
,
and
I
do
n't
know
those
,
"
she
murmured
to
herself
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
should
delight
to
look
round
me
from
the
brow
of
that
tallest
point
:
my
little
pony
Minny
shall
take
me
some
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
One
of
the
maids
mentioning
the
Fairy
Cave
,
quite
turned
her
head
with
a
desire
to
fulfil
this
project
:
she
teased
Mr.
Linton
about
it
;
and
he
promised
she
should
have
the
journey
when
she
got
older
.
<EOS>
But
Miss
Catherine
measured
her
age
by
months
,
and
,
"
Now
,
am
I
old
enough
to
go
to
Penistone
Crags
?
<EOS>
"
was
the
constant
question
in
her
mouth
.
<EOS>
The
road
thither
wound
close
by
Wuthering
Heights
.
<EOS>
Edgar
had
not
the
heart
to
pass
it
;
so
she
received
as
constantly
the
answer
,
"
Not
yet
,
love
:
not
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
said
Mrs.
Heathcliff
lived
above
a
dozen
years
after
quitting
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Her
family
were
of
a
delicate
constitution
:
she
and
Edgar
both
lacked
the
ruddy
health
that
you
will
generally
meet
in
these
parts
.
<EOS>
What
her
last
illness
was
,
I
am
not
certain
:
<EOS>
I
conjecture
,
they
died
of
the
same
thing
,
a
kind
of
fever
,
slow
at
its
commencement
,
but
incurable
,
and
rapidly
consuming
life
towards
the
close
.
<EOS>
She
wrote
to
inform
her
brother
of
the
probable
conclusion
of
a
four
-
months
'
indisposition
under
which
she
had
suffered
,
and
entreated
him
to
come
to
her
,
if
possible
;
for
she
had
much
to
settle
,
and
she
wished
to
bid
him
adieu
,
and
deliver
Linton
safely
into
his
hands
.
<EOS>
Her
hope
was
that
Linton
might
be
left
with
him
,
as
he
had
been
with
her
:
his
father
,
she
would
fain
convince
herself
,
had
no
desire
to
assume
the
burden
of
his
maintenance
or
education
.
<EOS>
My
master
hesitated
not
a
moment
in
complying
with
her
request
:
<EOS>
reluctant
as
he
was
to
leave
home
at
ordinary
calls
,
he
flew
to
answer
this
;
commanding
Catherine
to
my
peculiar
vigilance
,
in
his
absence
,
with
reiterated
orders
that
she
must
not
wander
out
of
the
park
,
even
under
my
escort
he
did
not
calculate
on
her
going
unaccompanied
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
away
three
weeks
.
<EOS>
The
first
day
or
two
my
charge
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
library
,
too
sad
for
either
reading
or
playing
:
in
that
quiet
state
she
caused
me
little
trouble
;
but
it
was
succeeded
by
an
interval
of
impatient
,
fretful
weariness
;
and
being
too
busy
,
and
too
old
then
,
to
run
up
and
down
amusing
her
<EOS>
,
I
hit
on
a
method
by
which
she
might
entertain
herself
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
send
her
on
her
travels
round
the
grounds
 
now
on
foot
,
and
now
on
a
pony
;
indulging
her
with
a
patient
audience
of
all
her
real
and
imaginary
adventures
when
she
returned
.
  
<EOS>
The
summer
shone
in
full
prime
;
and
she
took
such
a
taste
for
this
solitary
rambling
that
she
often
contrived
to
remain
out
from
breakfast
till
tea
;
and
then
the
evenings
were
spent
in
recounting
her
fanciful
tales
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
fear
her
breaking
bounds
;
because
the
gates
were
generally
locked
,
and
I
thought
she
would
scarcely
venture
forth
alone
,
if
they
had
stood
wide
open
.
<EOS>
Unluckily
,
my
confidence
proved
misplaced
.
<EOS>
Catherine
came
to
me
,
one
morning
,
at
eight
o'clock
,
and
said
she
was
that
day
an
Arabian
merchant
,
going
to
cross
the
Desert
with
his
caravan
;
and
I
must
give
her
plenty
of
provision
for
herself
and
beasts
:
a
horse
,
and
three
camels
,
personated
by
a
large
hound
and
a
couple
of
pointers
.
<EOS>
I
got
together
good
store
of
dainties
,
and
slung
them
in
a
basket
on
one
side
of
the
saddle
;
and
she
sprang
up
as
gay
as
a
fairy
,
sheltered
by
her
wide
-
brimmed
hat
and
gauze
veil
from
the
July
sun
,
and
trotted
off
with
a
merry
laugh
,
mocking
my
cautious
counsel
to
avoid
galloping
,
and
come
back
early
.
<EOS>
The
naughty
thing
never
made
her
appearance
at
tea
.
<EOS>
One
traveller
,
the
hound
,
being
an
old
dog
and
fond
of
its
ease
,
returned
;
but
neither
Cathy
,
nor
the
pony
,
nor
the
two
pointers
were
visible
in
any
direction
:
I
despatched
emissaries
down
this
path
,
and
that
path
,
and
at
last
went
wandering
in
search
of
her
myself
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
labourer
working
at
a
fence
round
a
plantation
,
on
the
borders
of
the
grounds
.
<EOS>
I
inquired
of
him
if
he
had
seen
our
young
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
saw
her
at
morn
,
"
he
replied
:
"
she
would
have
me
to
cut
her
a
hazel
switch
,
and
then
she
leapt
her
Galloway
over
the
hedge
yonder
,
where
it
is
lowest
,
and
galloped
out
of
sight
.
"
  
<EOS>
You
may
guess
how
I
felt
at
hearing
this
news
.
<EOS>
It
struck
me
directly
she
must
have
started
for
Penistone
Crags
.
<EOS>
"
What
will
become
of
her
?
<EOS>
"
I
ejaculated
,
pushing
through
a
gap
which
the
man
was
repairing
,
and
making
straight
to
the
high
-
road
.
<EOS>
I
walked
as
if
for
a
wager
,
mile
after
mile
,
till
a
turn
brought
me
in
view
of
the
Heights
;
but
no
Catherine
could
I
detect
,
far
or
near
.
<EOS>
The
Crags
lie
about
a
mile
and
a
half
beyond
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
place
,
and
that
is
four
from
the
Grange
,
so
I
began
to
fear
night
would
fall
ere
<EOS>
I
could
reach
them
.
"
<EOS>
And
what
if
she
should
have
slipped
in
clambering
among
them
,
"
I
reflected
,
"
and
been
killed
,
or
broken
some
of
her
bones
?
<EOS>
"
My
suspense
was
truly
painful
;
and
,
at
first
,
it
gave
me
delightful
relief
to
observe
,
in
hurrying
by
the
farmhouse
,
Charlie
,
the
fiercest
of
the
pointers
,
lying
under
a
window
,
with
swelled
head
and
bleeding
ear
.
<EOS>
I
opened
the
wicket
and
ran
to
the
door
,
knocking
vehemently
for
admittance
.
<EOS>
A
woman
whom
I
knew
,
and
who
formerly
lived
at
Gimmerton
,
answered
:
she
had
been
servant
there
since
the
death
of
Mr.
Earnshaw
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
she
,
"
you
are
come
a
-
seeking
your
little
mistress
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
frightened
.
<EOS>
She
's
here
safe
:
<EOS>
but
I
'm
glad
it
is
n't
the
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
at
home
then
,
is
he
?
<EOS>
"
I
panted
,
quite
breathless
with
quick
walking
and
alarm
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
she
replied
:
"
both
he
and
Joseph
are
off
,
and
I
think
they
wo
n't
return
this
hour
or
more
.
<EOS>
Step
in
and
rest
you
a
bit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
entered
,
and
beheld
my
stray
lamb
seated
on
the
hearth
,
rocking
herself
in
a
little
chair
that
had
been
her
mother
's
when
a
child
.
<EOS>
Her
hat
was
hung
against
the
wall
,
and
she
seemed
perfectly
at
home
,
laughing
and
chattering
,
in
the
best
spirits
imaginable
,
to
Hareton
 
now
a
great
,
strong
lad
of
eighteen
 
who
stared
at
her
with
considerable
curiosity
and
astonishment
:
<EOS>
comprehending
precious
little
of
the
fluent
succession
of
remarks
and
questions
which
her
tongue
never
ceased
pouring
forth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
Miss
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
,
concealing
my
joy
under
an
angry
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
your
last
ride
,
till
papa
comes
back
.
<EOS>
I
'll
not
trust
you
over
the
threshold
again
,
you
naughty
,
naughty
girl
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aha
,
Ellen
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
gaily
,
jumping
up
and
running
to
my
side
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
a
pretty
story
to
tell
to
-
night
;
and
so
you
've
found
me
out
.
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
been
here
in
your
life
before
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Put
that
hat
on
,
and
home
at
once
,
"
said
I.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
dreadfully
grieved
at
you
,
Miss
Cathy
:
you
've
done
extremely
wrong
!
<EOS>
It
's
no
use
pouting
and
crying
:
that
wo
n't
repay
the
trouble
I
've
had
,
scouring
the
country
after
you
.
<EOS>
To
think
how
Mr.
Linton
charged
me
to
keep
you
in
;
and
you
stealing
off
so
!
<EOS>
It
shows
you
are
a
cunning
little
fox
,
and
nobody
will
put
faith
in
you
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
done
?
"
sobbed
she
,
instantly
checked
.
<EOS>
"
Papa
charged
me
nothing
:
he
'll
not
scold
me
,
Ellen
 
<EOS>
he
's
never
cross
,
like
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
!
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tie
the
riband
.
<EOS>
Now
,
let
us
have
no
petulance
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
for
shame
!
<EOS>
You
thirteen
years
old
,
and
such
a
baby
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
exclamation
was
caused
by
her
pushing
the
hat
from
her
head
,
and
retreating
to
the
chimney
out
of
my
reach
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
said
the
servant
,
"
do
n't
be
hard
on
the
bonny
lass
,
Mrs.
Dean
.
<EOS>
We
made
her
stop
:
she
'd
fain
have
ridden
forwards
,
afeard
you
should
be
uneasy
.
<EOS>
Hareton
offered
to
go
with
her
,
and
I
thought
he
should
:
it
's
a
wild
road
over
the
hills
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hareton
,
during
the
discussion
,
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
too
awkward
to
speak
;
though
he
looked
as
if
he
did
not
relish
my
intrusion
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
am
I
to
wait
?
<EOS>
"
I
continued
,
disregarding
the
woman
's
interference
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
dark
in
ten
minutes
.
<EOS>
Where
is
the
pony
,
Miss
Cathy
?
<EOS>
And
where
is
Phoenix
?
<EOS>
I
shall
leave
you
,
unless
you
be
quick
;
so
please
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
pony
is
in
the
yard
,
"
she
replied
,
"
and
Phoenix
is
shut
in
there
.
<EOS>
He
's
bitten
 
and
so
is
Charlie
.
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
tell
you
all
about
it
;
but
you
are
in
a
bad
temper
,
and
do
n't
deserve
to
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
picked
up
her
hat
,
and
approached
to
reinstate
it
;
but
perceiving
that
the
people
of
the
house
took
her
part
,
she
commenced
capering
round
the
room
;
and
on
my
giving
chase
,
ran
like
a
mouse
over
and
under
and
behind
the
furniture
,
rendering
it
ridiculous
for
me
to
pursue
.
<EOS>
Hareton
and
the
woman
laughed
,
and
she
joined
them
,
and
waxed
more
impertinent
still
;
till
I
cried
,
in
great
irritation
,
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Miss
Cathy
,
if
you
were
aware
whose
house
this
is
you
'd
be
glad
enough
to
get
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
_
<EOS>
your
_
father
's
,
is
n't
it
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
turning
to
Hareton
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
he
replied
,
looking
down
,
and
blushing
bashfully
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
stand
a
steady
gaze
from
her
eyes
,
though
they
were
just
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whose
then
 
your
master
's
?
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
He
coloured
deeper
,
with
a
different
feeling
,
muttered
an
oath
,
and
turned
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
his
master
?
<EOS>
"
continued
the
tiresome
girl
,
appealing
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
He
talked
about
"
our
house
,
"
and
"
our
folk
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
he
had
been
the
owner
's
son
.
<EOS>
And
he
never
said
Miss
:
he
should
have
done
,
should
n't
he
,
if
he
's
a
servant
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hareton
grew
black
as
a
thunder
-
cloud
at
this
childish
speech
.
<EOS>
I
silently
shook
my
questioner
,
and
at
last
succeeded
in
equipping
her
for
departure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
get
my
horse
,
"
she
said
,
addressing
her
unknown
kinsman
as
she
would
one
of
the
stable
-
boys
at
the
Grange
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
may
come
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
where
the
goblin
-
hunter
rises
in
the
marsh
,
and
to
hear
about
the
_
fairishes
_
,
as
you
call
them
:
but
make
haste
!
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
Get
my
horse
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
'll
see
thee
damned
before
I
be
_
thy
_
servant
!
"
growled
the
lad
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
see
me
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
what
_
!
"
asked
Catherine
in
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Damned
 
thou
saucy
witch
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
Miss
Cathy
!
<EOS>
you
see
you
have
got
into
pretty
company
,
"
I
interposed
.
<EOS>
"
Nice
words
to
be
used
to
a
young
lady
!
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
begin
to
dispute
with
him
.
<EOS>
Come
,
let
us
seek
for
Minny
ourselves
,
and
begone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Ellen
,
"
cried
she
,
staring
fixed
in
astonishment
,
"
how
dare
he
speak
so
to
me
?
<EOS>
Must
n't
he
be
made
to
do
as
I
ask
him
?
<EOS>
You
wicked
creature
,
I
shall
tell
papa
what
you
said
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
then
!
"
  
<EOS>
Hareton
did
not
appear
to
feel
this
threat
;
so
the
tears
sprang
into
her
eyes
with
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
You
bring
the
pony
,
"
she
exclaimed
,
turning
to
the
woman
,
"
and
let
my
dog
free
this
moment
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Softly
,
Miss
,
"
answered
she
addressed
;
"
you
'll
lose
nothing
by
being
civil
.
<EOS>
Though
Mr.
Hareton
,
there
,
be
not
the
master
's
son
,
he
's
your
cousin
:
and
I
was
never
hired
to
serve
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
He
_
my
cousin
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Cathy
,
with
a
scornful
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
,
"
responded
her
reprover
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Ellen
!
<EOS>
do
n't
let
them
say
such
things
,
"
she
pursued
in
great
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
Papa
is
gone
to
fetch
my
cousin
from
London
:
my
cousin
is
a
gentleman
's
son
.
<EOS>
That
my
 
"
she
stopped
,
and
wept
outright
;
upset
at
the
bare
notion
of
relationship
with
such
a
clown
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
hush
!
"
<EOS>
I
whispered
;
"
people
can
have
many
cousins
and
of
all
sorts
,
Miss
Cathy
,
without
being
any
the
worse
for
it
;
only
they
need
n't
keep
their
company
,
if
they
be
disagreeable
and
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
not
 
<EOS>
he
's
not
my
cousin
,
Ellen
!
<EOS>
"
she
went
on
,
gathering
fresh
grief
from
reflection
,
and
flinging
herself
into
my
arms
for
refuge
from
the
idea
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
much
vexed
at
her
and
the
servant
for
their
mutual
revelations
;
having
no
doubt
of
Linton
's
approaching
arrival
,
communicated
by
the
former
,
being
reported
to
Mr.
Heathcliff
;
and
feeling
as
confident
that
Catherine
's
first
thought
on
her
father
's
return
would
be
to
seek
an
explanation
of
the
latter
's
assertion
concerning
her
rude
-
bred
kindred
.
<EOS>
Hareton
,
recovering
from
his
disgust
at
being
taken
for
a
servant
,
seemed
moved
by
her
distress
;
and
,
having
fetched
the
pony
round
to
the
door
,
he
took
,
to
propitiate
her
,
a
fine
crooked
-
legged
terrier
whelp
from
the
kennel
,
and
putting
it
into
her
hand
,
bid
her
whist
!
<EOS>
for
he
meant
nought
.
<EOS>
Pausing
in
her
lamentations
,
she
surveyed
him
with
a
glance
of
awe
and
horror
,
then
burst
forth
anew
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
scarcely
refrain
from
smiling
at
this
antipathy
to
the
poor
fellow
;
who
was
a
well
-
made
,
athletic
youth
,
good
-
looking
in
features
,
and
stout
and
healthy
,
but
attired
in
garments
befitting
his
daily
occupations
of
working
on
the
farm
and
lounging
among
the
moors
after
rabbits
and
game
.
<EOS>
Still
,
I
thought
I
could
detect
in
his
physiognomy
a
mind
owning
better
qualities
than
his
father
ever
possessed
.
<EOS>
Good
things
lost
amid
a
wilderness
of
weeds
,
to
be
sure
,
whose
rankness
far
over
-
topped
their
neglected
growth
;
yet
,
notwithstanding
,
evidence
of
a
wealthy
soil
,
that
might
yield
luxuriant
crops
under
other
and
favourable
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
I
believe
,
had
not
treated
him
physically
ill
;
thanks
to
his
fearless
nature
,
which
offered
no
temptation
to
that
course
of
oppression
:
he
had
none
of
the
timid
susceptibility
that
would
have
given
zest
to
ill
-
treatment
,
in
Heathcliff
's
judgment
.
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
have
bent
his
malevolence
on
making
him
a
brute
:
he
was
never
taught
to
read
or
write
;
never
rebuked
for
any
bad
habit
which
did
not
annoy
his
keeper
;
never
led
a
single
step
towards
virtue
,
or
guarded
by
a
single
precept
against
vice
.
<EOS>
And
from
what
I
heard
,
Joseph
contributed
much
to
his
deterioration
,
by
a
narrow
-
minded
partiality
which
prompted
him
to
flatter
and
pet
him
,
as
a
boy
,
because
he
was
the
head
of
the
old
family
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
accusing
Catherine
Earnshaw
and
Heathcliff
,
when
children
,
of
putting
the
master
past
his
patience
,
and
compelling
him
to
seek
solace
in
drink
by
what
he
termed
their
"
offald
ways
,
"
so
at
present
he
laid
the
whole
burden
of
Hareton
's
faults
on
the
shoulders
of
the
usurper
of
his
property
.
<EOS>
If
the
lad
swore
,
he
would
n't
correct
him
:
nor
however
culpably
he
behaved
.
<EOS>
It
gave
Joseph
satisfaction
,
apparently
,
to
watch
him
go
the
worst
lengths
:
he
allowed
that
the
lad
was
ruined
:
that
his
soul
was
abandoned
to
perdition
;
but
then
he
reflected
that
Heathcliff
must
answer
for
it
.
<EOS>
Hareton
's
blood
would
be
required
at
his
hands
;
and
there
lay
immense
consolation
in
that
thought
.
<EOS>
Joseph
had
instilled
into
him
a
pride
of
name
,
and
of
his
lineage
;
he
would
,
had
he
dared
,
have
fostered
hate
between
him
and
the
present
owner
of
the
Heights
:
but
his
dread
of
that
owner
amounted
to
superstition
;
and
he
confined
his
feelings
regarding
him
to
muttered
innuendoes
and
private
comminations
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
pretend
to
be
intimately
acquainted
with
the
mode
of
living
customary
in
those
days
at
Wuthering
Heights
:
I
only
speak
from
hearsay
;
for
I
saw
little
.
<EOS>
The
villagers
affirmed
Mr.
Heathcliff
was
_
near
_
,
and
a
cruel
hard
landlord
to
his
tenants
;
but
the
house
,
inside
,
had
regained
its
ancient
aspect
of
comfort
under
female
management
,
and
the
scenes
of
riot
common
in
Hindley
's
time
were
not
now
enacted
within
its
walls
.
<EOS>
The
master
was
too
gloomy
to
seek
companionship
with
any
people
,
good
or
bad
;
and
he
is
yet
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
is
not
making
progress
with
my
story
.
<EOS>
Miss
Cathy
rejected
the
peace
-
offering
of
the
terrier
,
and
demanded
her
own
dogs
,
Charlie
and
Phoenix
.
<EOS>
They
came
limping
and
hanging
their
heads
;
and
we
set
out
for
home
,
sadly
out
of
sorts
,
every
one
of
us
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
wring
from
my
little
lady
how
she
had
spent
the
day
;
except
that
,
as
I
supposed
,
the
goal
of
her
pilgrimage
was
Penistone
Crags
;
and
she
arrived
without
adventure
to
the
gate
of
the
farm
-
house
,
when
Hareton
happened
to
issue
forth
,
attended
by
some
canine
followers
,
who
attacked
her
train
.
<EOS>
They
had
a
smart
battle
,
before
their
owners
could
separate
them
:
that
formed
an
introduction
.
<EOS>
Catherine
told
Hareton
who
she
was
,
and
where
she
was
going
;
and
asked
him
to
show
her
the
way
:
finally
,
beguiling
him
to
accompany
her
.
<EOS>
He
opened
the
mysteries
of
the
Fairy
Cave
,
and
twenty
other
queer
places
.
<EOS>
But
,
being
in
disgrace
,
I
was
not
favoured
with
a
description
of
the
interesting
objects
she
saw
.
<EOS>
I
could
gather
,
however
,
that
her
guide
had
been
a
favourite
till
she
hurt
his
feelings
by
addressing
him
as
a
servant
;
and
Heathcliff
's
housekeeper
hurt
hers
by
calling
him
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
Then
the
language
he
had
held
to
her
rankled
in
her
heart
;
<EOS>
she
who
was
always
"
love
,
"
and
"
darling
,
"
and
"
queen
,
"
and
"
angel
,
"
with
everybody
at
the
Grange
,
to
be
insulted
so
shockingly
by
a
stranger
!
<EOS>
She
did
not
comprehend
it
;
and
hard
work
I
had
to
obtain
a
promise
that
she
would
not
lay
the
grievance
before
her
father
.
<EOS>
I
explained
how
he
objected
to
the
whole
household
at
the
Heights
,
and
how
sorry
he
would
be
to
find
she
had
been
there
;
but
I
insisted
most
on
the
fact
,
that
if
she
revealed
my
negligence
of
his
orders
,
he
would
perhaps
be
so
angry
that
I
should
have
to
leave
;
and
Cathy
could
n't
bear
that
prospect
:
she
pledged
her
word
,
and
kept
it
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
she
was
a
sweet
little
girl
.
    
<EOS>
A
letter
,
edged
with
black
,
announced
the
day
of
my
master
's
return
.
<EOS>
Isabella
was
dead
;
and
he
wrote
to
bid
me
get
mourning
for
his
daughter
,
and
arrange
a
room
,
and
other
accommodations
,
for
his
youthful
nephew
.
<EOS>
Catherine
ran
wild
with
joy
at
the
idea
of
welcoming
her
father
back
;
and
indulged
most
sanguine
anticipations
of
the
innumerable
excellencies
of
her
"
real
"
cousin
.
<EOS>
The
evening
of
their
expected
arrival
came
.
<EOS>
Since
early
morning
she
had
been
busy
ordering
her
own
small
affairs
;
and
now
attired
in
her
new
black
frock
 
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
her
aunt
's
death
impressed
her
with
no
definite
sorrow
 
<EOS>
she
obliged
me
,
by
constant
worrying
,
to
walk
with
her
down
through
the
grounds
to
meet
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Linton
is
just
six
months
younger
than
I
am
,
"
she
chattered
,
as
we
strolled
leisurely
over
the
swells
and
hollows
of
mossy
turf
,
under
shadow
of
the
trees
.
<EOS>
"
How
delightful
it
will
be
to
have
him
for
a
playfellow
!
<EOS>
Aunt
Isabella
sent
papa
a
beautiful
lock
of
his
hair
;
it
was
lighter
than
mine
 
more
flaxen
,
and
quite
as
fine
.
<EOS>
I
have
it
carefully
preserved
in
a
little
glass
box
;
and
I
've
often
thought
what
a
pleasure
it
would
be
to
see
its
owner
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
am
happy
 
and
papa
,
dear
,
dear
papa
!
<EOS>
Come
,
Ellen
,
let
us
run
!
<EOS>
come
,
run
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
ran
,
and
returned
and
ran
again
,
many
times
before
my
sober
footsteps
reached
the
gate
,
and
then
she
seated
herself
on
the
grassy
bank
beside
the
path
,
and
tried
to
wait
patiently
;
but
that
was
impossible
:
she
could
n't
be
still
a
minute
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
they
are
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
see
,
some
dust
on
the
road
 
they
are
coming
!
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
When
will
they
be
here
?
<EOS>
May
we
not
go
a
little
way
 
<EOS>
half
a
mile
,
Ellen
,
only
just
half
a
mile
?
<EOS>
Do
say
<EOS>
Yes
:
to
that
clump
of
birches
at
the
turn
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
refused
staunchly
.
<EOS>
At
length
her
suspense
was
ended
:
the
travelling
carriage
rolled
in
sight
.
<EOS>
Miss
Cathy
shrieked
and
stretched
out
her
arms
as
soon
as
she
caught
her
father
's
face
looking
from
the
window
.
<EOS>
He
descended
,
nearly
as
eager
as
herself
;
and
a
considerable
interval
elapsed
<EOS>
ere
they
had
a
thought
to
spare
for
any
but
themselves
.
<EOS>
While
they
exchanged
caresses
I
took
a
peep
in
to
see
after
Linton
.
<EOS>
He
was
asleep
in
a
corner
,
wrapped
in
a
warm
,
fur
-
lined
cloak
,
as
if
it
had
been
winter
.
<EOS>
A
pale
,
delicate
,
effeminate
boy
,
who
might
have
been
taken
for
my
master
's
younger
brother
,
so
strong
was
the
resemblance
:
but
there
was
a
sickly
peevishness
in
his
aspect
that
Edgar
Linton
never
had
.
<EOS>
The
latter
saw
me
looking
;
and
having
shaken
hands
,
advised
me
to
close
the
door
,
and
leave
him
undisturbed
;
for
the
journey
had
fatigued
him
.
<EOS>
Cathy
would
fain
have
taken
one
glance
,
but
her
father
told
her
to
come
,
and
they
walked
together
up
the
park
,
while
I
hastened
before
to
prepare
the
servants
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
darling
,
"
said
Mr.
Linton
,
addressing
his
daughter
,
as
they
halted
at
the
bottom
of
the
front
steps
:
"
your
cousin
is
not
so
strong
or
so
merry
as
you
are
,
and
he
has
lost
his
mother
,
remember
,
a
very
short
time
since
;
therefore
,
do
n't
expect
him
to
play
and
run
about
with
you
directly
.
<EOS>
And
do
n't
harass
him
much
by
talking
:
let
him
be
quiet
this
evening
,
at
least
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
papa
,
"
answered
Catherine
:
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
want
to
see
him
;
and
he
has
n't
once
looked
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
carriage
stopped
;
and
the
sleeper
being
roused
,
was
lifted
to
the
ground
by
his
uncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
your
cousin
Cathy
,
Linton
,
"
he
said
,
putting
their
little
hands
together
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
fond
of
you
already
;
and
mind
you
do
n't
grieve
her
by
crying
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Try
to
be
cheerful
now
;
the
travelling
is
at
an
end
,
and
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
rest
and
amuse
yourself
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
to
bed
,
then
,
"
answered
the
boy
,
shrinking
from
Catherine
's
salute
;
and
he
put
his
fingers
to
remove
incipient
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
there
's
a
good
child
,
"
I
whispered
,
leading
him
in
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
make
her
weep
too
 
see
how
sorry
she
is
for
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
it
was
sorrow
for
him
,
but
his
cousin
put
on
as
sad
a
countenance
as
himself
,
and
returned
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
All
three
entered
,
and
mounted
to
the
library
,
where
tea
was
laid
ready
.
<EOS>
I
proceeded
to
remove
Linton
's
cap
and
mantle
,
and
placed
him
on
a
chair
by
the
table
;
but
he
was
no
sooner
seated
than
he
began
to
cry
afresh
.
<EOS>
My
master
inquired
what
was
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
sit
on
a
chair
,
"
sobbed
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
to
the
sofa
,
then
,
and
Ellen
shall
bring
you
some
tea
,
"
answered
his
uncle
patiently
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
greatly
tried
,
during
the
journey
,
I
felt
convinced
,
by
his
fretful
ailing
charge
.
<EOS>
Linton
slowly
trailed
himself
off
,
and
lay
down
.
<EOS>
Cathy
carried
a
footstool
and
her
cup
to
his
side
.
<EOS>
At
first
she
sat
silent
;
but
that
could
not
last
:
she
had
resolved
to
make
a
pet
of
her
little
cousin
,
as
she
would
have
him
to
be
;
and
she
commenced
stroking
his
curls
,
and
kissing
his
cheek
,
and
offering
him
tea
in
her
saucer
,
like
a
baby
.
<EOS>
This
pleased
him
,
for
he
was
not
much
better
:
he
dried
his
eyes
,
and
lightened
into
a
faint
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
'll
do
very
well
,
"
said
the
master
to
me
,
after
watching
them
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
,
if
we
can
keep
him
,
Ellen
.
<EOS>
The
company
of
a
child
of
his
own
age
will
instil
new
spirit
into
him
soon
,
and
by
wishing
for
strength
he
'll
gain
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
if
we
can
keep
him
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
mused
to
myself
;
and
sore
misgivings
came
over
me
that
there
was
slight
hope
of
that
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
I
thought
,
how
ever
will
that
weakling
live
at
Wuthering
Heights
?
<EOS>
Between
his
father
and
Hareton
,
what
playmates
and
instructors
they
'll
be
.
<EOS>
Our
doubts
were
presently
decided
 
even
earlier
than
I
expected
.
<EOS>
I
had
just
taken
the
children
up
-
stairs
,
after
tea
was
finished
,
and
seen
Linton
asleep
 
<EOS>
he
would
not
suffer
me
to
leave
him
till
<EOS>
that
was
the
case
 
<EOS>
I
had
come
down
,
and
was
standing
by
the
table
in
the
hall
,
lighting
a
bedroom
candle
for
Mr.
Edgar
,
when
a
maid
stepped
out
of
the
kitchen
and
informed
me
that
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
servant
Joseph
was
at
the
door
,
and
wished
to
speak
with
the
master
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
ask
him
what
he
wants
first
,
"
I
said
,
in
considerable
trepidation
.
<EOS>
"
A
very
unlikely
hour
to
be
troubling
people
,
and
the
instant
they
have
returned
from
a
long
journey
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
the
master
can
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Joseph
had
advanced
through
the
kitchen
as
I
uttered
these
words
,
and
now
presented
himself
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
He
was
donned
in
his
Sunday
garments
,
with
his
most
sanctimonious
and
sourest
face
,
and
,
holding
his
hat
in
one
hand
,
and
his
stick
in
the
other
,
he
proceeded
to
clean
his
shoes
on
the
mat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
evening
,
Joseph
,
"
I
said
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
What
business
brings
you
here
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
Maister
Linton
<EOS>
I
mun
spake
to
,
"
he
answered
,
waving
me
disdainfully
aside
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Linton
is
going
to
bed
;
unless
you
have
something
particular
to
say
,
I
'm
sure
he
wo
n't
hear
it
now
,
"
I
continued
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
sit
down
in
there
,
and
entrust
your
message
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Which
is
his
rahm
?
<EOS>
"
pursued
the
fellow
,
surveying
the
range
of
closed
doors
.
  
<EOS>
I
perceived
he
was
bent
on
refusing
my
mediation
,
so
very
reluctantly
I
went
up
to
the
library
,
and
announced
the
unseasonable
visitor
,
advising
that
he
should
be
dismissed
till
next
day
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
had
no
time
to
empower
me
to
do
so
,
for
Joseph
mounted
close
at
my
heels
,
and
,
pushing
into
the
apartment
,
planted
himself
at
the
far
side
of
the
table
,
with
his
two
fists
clapped
on
the
head
of
his
stick
,
and
began
in
an
elevated
tone
,
as
if
anticipating
opposition
    
<EOS>
"
Hathecliff
has
sent
me
for
his
lad
,
and
I
munn't
goa
back
<EOS>
"
bout
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edgar
Linton
was
silent
a
minute
;
an
expression
of
exceeding
sorrow
overcast
his
features
:
he
would
have
pitied
the
child
on
his
own
account
;
but
,
recalling
Isabella
's
hopes
and
fears
,
and
anxious
wishes
for
her
son
,
and
her
commendations
of
him
to
his
care
,
he
grieved
bitterly
at
the
prospect
of
yielding
him
up
,
and
searched
in
his
heart
how
it
might
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
No
plan
offered
itself
:
the
very
exhibition
of
any
desire
to
keep
him
would
have
rendered
the
claimant
more
peremptory
:
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
resign
him
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
was
not
going
to
rouse
him
from
his
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
"
he
answered
calmly
,
"
that
his
son
shall
come
to
Wuthering
Heights
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
is
in
bed
,
and
too
tired
to
go
the
distance
now
.
<EOS>
You
may
also
tell
him
that
the
mother
of
Linton
desired
him
to
remain
under
my
guardianship
;
and
,
at
present
,
his
health
is
very
precarious
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Noa
!
"
said
Joseph
,
giving
a
thud
with
his
prop
on
the
floor
,
and
assuming
an
authoritative
air
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Noa
!
<EOS>
that
means
naught
.
<EOS>
Hathecliff
maks

count
o

nor

but
he
'll

his

I

<EOS>
him
 
soa
now
<EOS>
ye
knaw

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
to
-
night
!
"
answered
Linton
decisively
.
"
<EOS>
Walk
down
stairs
at
once
,
and
repeat
to
your
master
what
I
have
said
.
<EOS>
Ellen
,
show
him
down
.
<EOS>
Go
 
"
  
And
,
aiding
the
indignant
elder
with
a
lift
by
the
arm
,
he
rid
the
room
of
him
and
closed
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Varrah
weell
!
"
<EOS>
shouted
Joseph
,
as
he
slowly
drew
off
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
-
morn
,
he
's
come
hisseln
,
and
thrust
_
him
_
out
,
if
ye
darr
!
"
    
<EOS>
To
obviate
the
danger
of
this
threat
being
fulfilled
,
Mr.
Linton
commissioned
me
to
take
the
boy
home
early
,
on
Catherine
's
pony
;
and
,
said
he
 
"
As
we
shall
now
have
no
influence
over
his
destiny
,
good
or
bad
,
you
must
say
nothing
of
where
he
is
gone
to
my
daughter
:
she
can
not
associate
with
him
hereafter
,
and
it
is
better
for
her
to
remain
in
ignorance
of
his
proximity
;
lest
she
should
be
restless
,
and
anxious
to
visit
the
Heights
.
<EOS>
Merely
tell
her
his
father
sent
for
him
suddenly
,
and
he
has
been
obliged
to
leave
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
Linton
was
very
reluctant
to
be
roused
from
his
bed
at
five
o'clock
,
and
astonished
to
be
informed
that
he
must
prepare
for
further
travelling
;
but
I
softened
off
the
matter
by
stating
that
he
was
going
to
spend
some
time
with
his
father
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
who
wished
to
see
him
so
much
,
he
did
not
like
to
defer
the
pleasure
till
he
should
recover
from
his
late
journey
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
in
strange
perplexity
.
"
<EOS>
Mamma
never
told
me
I
had
a
father
.
<EOS>
Where
does
he
live
?
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
stay
with
uncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
lives
a
little
distance
from
the
Grange
,
"
I
replied
;
"
just
beyond
those
hills
:
not
so
far
,
but
you
may
walk
over
here
when
you
get
hearty
.
<EOS>
And
you
should
be
glad
to
go
home
,
and
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
You
must
try
to
love
him
,
as
you
did
your
mother
,
and
then
he
will
love
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
have
I
not
heard
of
him
before
?
"
asked
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
mamma
and
he
live
together
,
as
other
people
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
had
business
to
keep
him
in
the
north
,
"
I
answered
,
"
and
your
mother
's
health
required
her
to
reside
in
the
south
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
did
n't
mamma
speak
to
me
about
him
?
"
persevered
the
child
.
<EOS>
"
She
often
talked
of
uncle
,
and
I
learnt
to
love
him
long
ago
.
<EOS>
How
am
I
to
love
papa
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
all
children
love
their
parents
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Your
mother
,
perhaps
,
thought
you
would
want
to
be
with
him
if
she
mentioned
him
often
to
you
.
<EOS>
Let
us
make
haste
.
<EOS>
An
early
ride
on
such
a
beautiful
morning
is
much
preferable
to
an
hour
's
more
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Is
_
she
_
to
go
with
us
,
"
he
demanded
,
"
the
little
girl
I
saw
yesterday
?
"
  
"
Not
now
,
"
replied
I.
  
"
<EOS>
Is
uncle
?
"
<EOS>
he
continued
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
shall
be
your
companion
there
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
Linton
sank
back
on
his
pillow
and
fell
into
a
brown
study
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
go
without
uncle
,
"
he
cried
at
length
:
"
I
ca
n't
tell
where
you
mean
to
take
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
attempted
to
persuade
him
of
the
naughtiness
of
showing
reluctance
to
meet
his
father
;
still
he
obstinately
resisted
any
progress
towards
dressing
,
and
I
had
to
call
for
my
master
's
assistance
in
coaxing
him
out
of
bed
.
<EOS>
The
poor
thing
was
finally
got
off
,
with
several
delusive
assurances
that
his
absence
should
be
short
:
that
Mr.
Edgar
and
Cathy
would
visit
him
,
and
other
promises
,
equally
ill
-
founded
,
which
I
invented
and
reiterated
at
intervals
throughout
the
way
.
<EOS>
The
pure
heather
-
scented
air
,
the
bright
sunshine
,
and
the
gentle
canter
of
Minny
,
relieved
his
despondency
after
a
while
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
put
questions
concerning
his
new
home
,
and
its
inhabitants
,
with
greater
interest
and
liveliness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Wuthering
Heights
as
pleasant
a
place
as
Thrushcross
Grange
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
,
turning
to
take
a
last
glance
into
the
valley
,
whence
a
light
mist
mounted
and
formed
a
fleecy
cloud
on
the
skirts
of
the
blue
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
so
buried
in
trees
,
"
I
replied
,
"
and
it
is
not
quite
so
large
,
but
you
can
see
the
country
beautifully
all
round
;
and
the
air
is
healthier
for
you
 
fresher
and
drier
.
<EOS>
You
will
,
perhaps
,
think
the
building
old
and
dark
at
first
;
though
it
is
a
respectable
house
:
the
next
best
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
And
you
will
have
such
nice
rambles
on
the
moors
.
<EOS>
Hareton
Earnshaw
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
Miss
Cathy
's
other
cousin
,
and
<EOS>
so
yours
in
a
manner
 
will
show
you
all
the
sweetest
spots
;
and
you
can
bring
a
book
in
fine
weather
,
and
make
a
green
hollow
your
study
;
and
,
now
and
then
,
your
uncle
may
join
you
in
a
walk
:
he
does
,
frequently
,
walk
out
on
the
hills
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
is
my
father
like
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Is
he
as
young
and
handsome
as
uncle
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
as
young
,
"
said
I
;
"
but
he
has
black
hair
and
eyes
,
and
looks
sterner
;
and
he
is
taller
and
bigger
altogether
.
<EOS>
He
'll
not
seem
to
you
so
gentle
and
kind
at
first
,
perhaps
,
because
it
is
not
his
way
:
<EOS>
still
,
mind
you
,
be
frank
and
cordial
with
him
;
and
naturally
he
'll
be
fonder
of
you
than
any
uncle
,
for
you
are
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Black
hair
and
eyes
!
"
<EOS>
mused
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
fancy
him
.
<EOS>
Then
I
am
not
like
him
,
am
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
much
,
"
I
answered
:
not
a
morsel
,
I
thought
,
surveying
with
regret
the
white
complexion
and
slim
frame
of
my
companion
,
and
his
large
languid
eyes
 
<EOS>
his
mother
's
eyes
,
save
that
,
unless
a
morbid
touchiness
kindled
them
a
moment
,
they
had
not
a
vestige
of
her
sparkling
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
strange
that
he
should
never
come
to
see
mamma
and
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
murmured
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Has
he
ever
seen
me
?
<EOS>
If
he
has
,
I
must
have
been
a
baby
.
<EOS>
I
remember
not
a
single
thing
about
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Master
Linton
,
"
said
I
,
"
three
hundred
miles
is
a
great
distance
;
and
ten
years
seem
very
different
in
length
to
a
grown
-
up
person
compared
with
what
they
do
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
probable
Mr.
Heathcliff
proposed
going
from
summer
to
summer
,
but
never
found
a
convenient
opportunity
;
and
now
it
is
too
late
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
trouble
him
with
questions
on
the
subject
:
it
will
disturb
him
,
for
no
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
was
fully
occupied
with
his
own
cogitations
for
the
remainder
of
the
ride
,
till
we
halted
before
the
farmhouse
garden
-
gate
.
<EOS>
I
watched
to
catch
his
impressions
in
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
surveyed
the
carved
front
and
low
-
browed
lattices
,
the
straggling
gooseberry
-
bushes
and
crooked
firs
,
with
solemn
intentness
,
and
then
shook
his
head
:
his
private
feelings
entirely
disapproved
of
the
exterior
of
his
new
abode
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
sense
to
postpone
complaining
:
there
might
be
compensation
within
.
<EOS>
Before
he
dismounted
,
I
went
and
opened
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
was
half
-
past
six
;
the
family
had
just
finished
breakfast
:
the
servant
was
clearing
and
wiping
down
the
table
.
<EOS>
Joseph
stood
by
his
master
's
chair
telling
some
tale
concerning
a
lame
horse
;
and
Hareton
was
preparing
for
the
hayfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hallo
,
Nelly
!
"
said
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
when
he
saw
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
feared
I
should
have
to
come
down
and
fetch
my
property
myself
.
<EOS>
You
've
brought
it
,
have
you
?
<EOS>
Let
us
see
what
we
can
make
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
got
up
and
strode
to
the
door
:
Hareton
and
Joseph
followed
in
gaping
curiosity
.
<EOS>
Poor
Linton
ran
a
frightened
eye
over
the
faces
of
the
three
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sure
-
ly
,
"
said
Joseph
after
a
grave
inspection
,
"
he
's
swopped
wi
'
ye
,
Maister
,
an
'
yon
's
his
lass
!
"
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
,
having
stared
his
son
into
an
ague
of
confusion
,
uttered
a
scornful
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
!
<EOS>
what
a
beauty
!
<EOS>
what
a
lovely
,
charming
thing
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
Hav'n"t
<EOS>
they
reared
it
on
snails
and
sour
milk
,
Nelly
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
damn
my
soul
!
<EOS>
but
that
's
worse
than
I
expected
 
and
the
devil
knows
I
was
not
sanguine
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
bid
the
trembling
and
bewildered
child
get
down
,
and
enter
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
thoroughly
comprehend
the
meaning
of
his
father
's
speech
,
or
whether
it
were
intended
for
him
:
indeed
,
he
was
not
yet
certain
that
the
grim
,
sneering
stranger
was
his
father
.
<EOS>
But
he
clung
to
me
with
growing
trepidation
;
and
on
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
taking
a
seat
and
bidding
him
"
come
hither
<EOS>
"
he
hid
his
face
on
my
shoulder
and
wept
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
tut
!
<EOS>
"
said
Heathcliff
,
stretching
out
a
hand
and
dragging
him
roughly
between
his
knees
,
and
then
holding
up
his
head
by
the
chin
.
<EOS>
"
None
of
that
nonsense
!
<EOS>
We
're
not
going
to
hurt
thee
,
Linton
 
is
n't
that
thy
name
?
<EOS>
Thou
art
thy
mother
's
child
,
entirely
!
<EOS>
Where
is
my
share
in
thee
,
puling
chicken
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
off
the
boy
's
cap
and
pushed
back
his
thick
flaxen
curls
,
felt
his
slender
arms
and
his
small
fingers
;
during
which
examination
Linton
ceased
crying
,
and
lifted
his
great
blue
eyes
to
inspect
the
inspector
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
me
?
"
asked
Heathcliff
,
having
satisfied
himself
that
the
limbs
were
all
equally
frail
and
feeble
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Linton
,
with
a
gaze
of
vacant
fear
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
heard
of
me
,
I
daresay
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
replied
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
<EOS>
What
a
shame
of
your
mother
,
never
to
waken
your
filial
regard
for
me
!
<EOS>
You
are
my
son
,
then
,
I
'll
tell
you
;
and
your
mother
was
a
wicked
slut
to
leave
you
in
ignorance
of
the
sort
of
father
you
possessed
.
<EOS>
Now
,
do
n't
wince
,
and
colour
up
!
<EOS>
Though
it
is
something
to
see
you
have
not
white
blood
.
<EOS>
Be
a
good
lad
;
and
I
'll
do
for
you
.
<EOS>
Nelly
,
if
you
be
tired
you
may
sit
down
;
if
not
,
get
home
again
.
<EOS>
I
guess
you
'll
report
what
you
hear
and
see
to
the
cipher
at
the
Grange
;
and
this
thing
wo
n't
be
settled
while
you
linger
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
replied
I
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
you
'll
be
kind
to
the
boy
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
or
you
'll
not
keep
him
long
;
and
he
's
all
you
have
akin
in
the
wide
world
,
that
you
will
ever
know
 
remember
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
very
kind
to
him
,
you
need
n't
fear
,
"
he
said
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
Only
nobody
else
must
be
kind
to
him
:
I
'm
jealous
of
monopolising
his
affection
.
<EOS>
And
,
to
begin
my
kindness
,
Joseph
,
bring
the
lad
some
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Hareton
,
you
infernal
calf
,
begone
to
your
work
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
Nell
,
"
he
added
,
when
they
had
departed
,
"
my
son
is
prospective
owner
of
your
place
,
and
I
should
not
wish
him
to
die
till
I
was
certain
of
being
his
successor
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
's
_
mine
_
,
and
I
want
the
triumph
of
seeing
_
my
_
descendant
fairly
lord
of
their
estates
;
<EOS>
my
child
hiring
their
children
to
till
their
fathers
'
lands
for
wages
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
sole
consideration
which
can
make
me
endure
the
whelp
:
I
despise
him
for
himself
,
and
hate
him
for
the
memories
he
revives
!
<EOS>
But
that
consideration
is
sufficient
:
he
's
as
safe
with
me
,
and
shall
be
tended
as
carefully
as
your
master
tends
his
own
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
room
up
-
stairs
,
furnished
for
him
in
handsome
style
;
I
've
engaged
a
tutor
,
also
,
to
come
three
times
a
week
,
from
twenty
miles
'
distance
,
to
teach
him
what
he
pleases
to
learn
.
<EOS>
I
've
ordered
Hareton
to
obey
him
:
and
in
fact
I
've
arranged
everything
with
a
view
to
preserve
the
superior
and
the
gentleman
in
him
,
above
his
associates
.
<EOS>
I
do
regret
,
however
,
that
he
so
little
deserves
the
trouble
:
if
I
wished
any
blessing
in
the
world
,
it
was
to
find
him
a
worthy
object
of
pride
;
and
I
'm
bitterly
disappointed
with
the
whey
-
faced
,
whining
wretch
!
"
  
<EOS>
While
he
was
speaking
,
Joseph
returned
bearing
a
basin
of
milk
-
porridge
,
and
placed
it
before
Linton
:
who
stirred
round
the
homely
mess
with
a
look
of
aversion
,
and
affirmed
he
could
not
eat
it
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
old
man
-
servant
shared
largely
in
his
master
's
scorn
of
the
child
;
though
he
was
compelled
to
retain
the
sentiment
in
his
heart
,
because
Heathcliff
plainly
meant
his
underlings
to
hold
him
in
honour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
not
ate
it
?
<EOS>
"
repeated
he
,
peering
in
Linton
's
face
,
and
subduing
his
voice
to
a
whisper
,
for
fear
of
being
overheard
.
"
<EOS>
But
Maister
Hareton
nivir
ate
naught
else
,
when
he
wer
a
little
'
un
;
and
what
wer
gooid
enough
for
him
's
gooid
enough
for
ye
<EOS>
,
I
's
rayther
think
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
sha'n't
_
eat
it
!
"
<EOS>
answered
Linton
,
snappishly
.
<EOS>
"
Take
it
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
Joseph
snatched
up
the
food
indignantly
,
and
brought
it
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
aught
ails
th
'
 
victuals
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
thrusting
the
tray
under
Heathcliff
's
nose
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
should
ail
them
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wah
!
"
answered
Joseph
,
"
yon
dainty
chap
says
he
cannut
ate
'em
.
<EOS>
But
I
guess
it
's
raight
!
<EOS>
His
mother
wer
just
soa
 
<EOS>
we
wer
a'most
too
mucky
to
sow
t
'
corn
for
makking
her
breead
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
mention
his
mother
to
me
,
"
said
the
master
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Get
him
something
that
he
can
eat
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
What
is
his
usual
food
,
Nelly
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
suggested
boiled
milk
or
tea
;
and
the
housekeeper
received
instructions
to
prepare
some
.
<EOS>
Come
,
I
reflected
,
his
father
's
selfishness
may
contribute
to
his
comfort
.
<EOS>
He
perceives
his
delicate
constitution
,
and
the
necessity
of
treating
him
tolerably
.
<EOS>
I
'll
console
Mr.
Edgar
by
acquainting
him
with
the
turn
Heathcliff
's
humour
has
taken
.
<EOS>
Having
no
excuse
for
lingering
longer
,
I
slipped
out
,
while
Linton
was
engaged
in
timidly
rebuffing
the
advances
of
a
friendly
sheep
-
dog
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
too
much
on
the
alert
to
be
cheated
:
as
I
closed
the
door
,
I
heard
a
cry
,
and
a
frantic
repetition
of
the
words
    
"
Do
n't
leave
me
!
<EOS>
I
'll
not
stay
here
!
<EOS>
I
'll
not
stay
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
Then
the
latch
was
raised
and
fell
:
<EOS>
they
did
not
suffer
him
to
come
forth
.
<EOS>
I
mounted
Minny
,
and
urged
her
to
a
trot
;
and
so
my
brief
guardianship
ended
.
    
<EOS>
We
had
sad
work
with
little
Cathy
that
day
:
she
rose
in
high
glee
,
eager
to
join
her
cousin
,
and
such
passionate
tears
and
lamentations
followed
the
news
of
his
departure
that
Edgar
himself
was
obliged
to
soothe
her
,
by
affirming
he
should
come
back
soon
<EOS>
:
he
added
,
however
,
"
if
I
can
get
him
"
;
and
there
were
no
hopes
of
that
.
<EOS>
This
promise
poorly
pacified
her
;
but
time
was
more
potent
;
and
though
still
at
intervals
she
inquired
of
her
father
when
Linton
would
return
,
before
she
did
see
him
again
his
features
had
waxed
so
dim
in
her
memory
that
she
did
not
recognise
him
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
chanced
to
encounter
the
housekeeper
of
Wuthering
Heights
,
in
paying
business
visits
to
Gimmerton
,
I
used
to
ask
how
the
young
master
got
on
;
for
he
lived
almost
as
secluded
as
Catherine
herself
,
and
was
never
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
I
could
gather
from
her
that
he
continued
in
weak
health
,
and
was
a
tiresome
inmate
.
<EOS>
She
said
Mr.
Heathcliff
seemed
to
dislike
him
ever
longer
and
worse
,
though
he
took
some
trouble
to
conceal
it
:
he
had
an
antipathy
to
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
and
could
not
do
at
all
with
his
sitting
in
the
same
room
with
him
<EOS>
many
minutes
together
.
<EOS>
There
seldom
passed
much
talk
between
them
:
Linton
learnt
his
lessons
and
spent
his
evenings
in
a
small
apartment
they
called
the
parlour
:
or
else
lay
in
bed
all
day
:
for
he
was
constantly
getting
coughs
,
and
colds
,
and
aches
,
and
pains
of
some
sort
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
never
know
such
a
fainthearted
creature
,
"
added
the
woman
;
"
nor
one
so
careful
of
hisseln
.
<EOS>
He
_
will
_
go
on
,
if
I
leave
the
window
open
a
bit
late
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
's
killing
,
a
breath
of
night
air
!
<EOS>
And
he
must
have
a
fire
in
the
middle
of
summer
;
and
Joseph
's
bacca
-
pipe
is
poison
;
and
he
must
always
have
sweets
and
dainties
,
and
always
milk
,
milk
for
ever
 
heeding
naught
how
the
rest
of
us
are
pinched
in
winter
;
and
there
he
'll
sit
,
wrapped
in
his
furred
cloak
in
his
chair
by
the
fire
,
with
some
toast
and
water
or
other
slop
on
the
hob
to
sip
at
;
and
if
Hareton
,
for
pity
,
comes
to
amuse
him
 
<EOS>
Hareton
is
not
bad
-
natured
,
though
he
's
rough
 
<EOS>
they
're
sure
to
part
,
one
swearing
and
the
other
crying
.
<EOS>
I
believe
the
master
would
relish
Earnshaw
's
thrashing
him
to
a
mummy
,
if
he
were
not
his
son
;
and
I
'm
certain
he
would
be
fit
to
turn
him
out
of
doors
,
if
he
knew
half
the
nursing
he
gives
hisseln
.
<EOS>
But
then
he
wo
n't
go
into
danger
of
temptation
:
he
never
enters
the
parlour
,
and
should
Linton
show
those
ways
in
the
house
where
he
is
,
he
sends
him
up
-
stairs
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
divined
,
from
this
account
,
that
utter
lack
of
sympathy
had
rendered
young
Heathcliff
selfish
and
disagreeable
,
if
he
were
not
so
originally
;
and
my
interest
in
him
,
consequently
,
decayed
:
though
still
I
was
moved
with
a
sense
of
grief
at
his
lot
,
and
a
wish
that
he
had
been
left
with
us
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Edgar
encouraged
me
to
gain
information
:
he
thought
a
great
deal
about
him
,
I
fancy
,
and
would
have
run
some
risk
to
see
him
;
and
he
told
me
once
to
ask
the
housekeeper
whether
he
ever
came
into
the
village
?
<EOS>
She
said
he
had
only
been
twice
,
on
horseback
,
accompanying
his
father
;
and
both
times
he
pretended
to
be
quite
knocked
up
for
three
or
four
days
afterwards
.
<EOS>
That
housekeeper
left
,
if
I
recollect
rightly
,
two
years
after
he
came
;
and
another
,
whom
I
did
not
know
,
was
her
successor
;
she
lives
there
still
.
  
<EOS>
Time
wore
on
at
the
Grange
in
its
former
pleasant
way
till
Miss
Cathy
reached
sixteen
.
<EOS>
On
the
anniversary
of
her
birth
we
never
manifested
any
signs
of
rejoicing
,
because
it
was
also
the
anniversary
of
my
late
mistress
's
death
.
<EOS>
Her
father
invariably
spent
that
day
alone
in
the
library
;
and
walked
,
at
dusk
,
as
far
as
Gimmerton
kirkyard
,
where
he
would
frequently
prolong
his
stay
beyond
midnight
.
<EOS>
Therefore
Catherine
was
thrown
on
her
own
resources
for
amusement
.
<EOS>
This
twentieth
of
March
was
a
beautiful
spring
day
,
and
when
her
father
had
retired
,
my
young
lady
came
down
dressed
for
going
out
,
and
said
she
asked
to
have
a
ramble
on
the
edge
of
the
moor
with
me
<EOS>
:
Mr.
Linton
had
given
her
leave
,
if
we
went
only
a
short
distance
and
were
back
within
the
hour
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
make
haste
,
Ellen
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
where
I
wish
to
go
;
where
a
colony
of
moor
-
game
are
settled
:
I
want
to
see
whether
they
have
made
their
nests
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
must
be
a
good
distance
up
,
"
I
answered
;
"
they
do
n't
breed
on
the
edge
of
the
moor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
's
not
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
gone
very
near
with
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
put
on
my
bonnet
and
sallied
out
,
thinking
nothing
more
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
She
bounded
before
me
,
and
returned
to
my
side
,
and
was
off
again
like
a
young
greyhound
;
and
,
at
first
,
I
found
plenty
of
entertainment
in
listening
to
the
larks
singing
far
and
near
,
and
enjoying
the
sweet
,
warm
sunshine
;
and
watching
her
,
my
pet
and
my
delight
,
with
her
golden
ringlets
flying
loose
behind
,
and
her
bright
cheek
,
as
soft
and
pure
in
its
bloom
as
a
wild
rose
,
and
her
eyes
radiant
with
cloudless
pleasure
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
happy
creature
,
and
an
angel
,
in
those
days
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
pity
she
could
not
be
content
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
I
,
"
<EOS>
where
are
your
moor
-
game
,
Miss
Cathy
?
<EOS>
We
should
be
at
them
:
<EOS>
the
Grange
park
-
fence
is
a
great
way
off
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
a
little
further
 
only
a
little
further
,
Ellen
,
"
was
her
answer
,
continually
.
<EOS>
"
Climb
to
that
hillock
,
pass
that
bank
,
and
by
the
time
you
reach
the
other
side
I
shall
have
raised
the
birds
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
there
were
so
many
hillocks
and
banks
to
climb
and
pass
,
that
,
at
length
,
I
began
to
be
weary
,
and
told
her
we
must
halt
,
and
retrace
our
steps
.
<EOS>
I
shouted
to
her
,
as
she
had
outstripped
me
a
long
way
;
she
either
did
not
hear
or
did
not
regard
,
for
she
still
sprang
on
,
and
I
was
compelled
to
follow
.
<EOS>
Finally
,
she
dived
into
a
hollow
;
and
before
I
came
in
sight
of
her
again
,
she
was
two
miles
nearer
Wuthering
Heights
than
her
own
home
;
and
I
beheld
a
couple
of
persons
arrest
her
,
one
of
whom
I
felt
convinced
was
Mr.
Heathcliff
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Cathy
had
been
caught
in
the
fact
of
plundering
,
or
,
at
least
,
hunting
out
the
nests
of
the
grouse
.
<EOS>
The
Heights
were
Heathcliff
's
land
,
and
he
was
reproving
the
poacher
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
neither
taken
any
nor
found
any
,
"
she
said
,
as
I
toiled
to
them
,
expanding
her
hands
in
corroboration
of
the
statement
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
to
take
them
;
but
papa
told
me
there
were
quantities
up
here
,
and
I
wished
to
see
the
eggs
.
"
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
glanced
at
me
with
an
ill
-
meaning
smile
,
expressing
his
acquaintance
with
the
party
,
and
,
consequently
,
his
malevolence
towards
it
,
and
demanded
who
"
papa
"
was
?
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Linton
of
Thrushcross
Grange
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
did
not
know
me
,
or
you
would
n't
have
spoken
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
suppose
papa
is
highly
esteemed
and
respected
,
then
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
sarcastically
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Catherine
,
gazing
curiously
on
the
speaker
.
<EOS>
"
That
man
I
've
seen
before
.
<EOS>
Is
he
your
son
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
pointed
to
Hareton
,
the
other
individual
,
who
had
gained
nothing
but
increased
bulk
and
strength
by
the
addition
of
two
years
to
his
age
:
he
seemed
as
awkward
and
rough
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Cathy
,
"
I
interrupted
,
"
it
will
be
three
hours
instead
of
one
that
we
are
out
,
presently
.
<EOS>
We
really
must
go
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
that
man
is
not
my
son
,
"
answered
Heathcliff
,
pushing
me
aside
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
one
,
and
you
have
seen
him
before
too
;
and
,
though
your
nurse
is
in
a
hurry
,
I
think
both
you
and
she
would
be
the
better
for
a
little
rest
.
<EOS>
Will
you
just
turn
this
nab
of
heath
,
and
walk
into
my
house
?
<EOS>
You
'll
get
home
earlier
for
the
ease
;
and
you
shall
receive
a
kind
welcome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
whispered
Catherine
<EOS>
that
she
must
n't
,
on
any
account
,
accede
to
the
proposal
:
it
was
entirely
out
of
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
aloud
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
tired
of
running
,
and
the
ground
is
dewy
:
I
ca
n't
sit
here
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
,
Ellen
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
says
I
have
seen
his
son
.
<EOS>
He
's
mistaken
,
I
think
;
but
I
guess
where
he
lives
:
at
the
farmhouse
I
visited
in
coming
from
Penistone
Crags
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Nelly
,
hold
your
tongue
 
it
will
be
a
treat
for
her
to
look
in
on
us
.
<EOS>
Hareton
,
get
forwards
with
the
lass
.
<EOS>
You
shall
walk
with
me
,
Nelly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
she
's
not
going
to
any
such
place
,
"
I
cried
,
struggling
to
release
my
arm
,
which
he
had
seized
:
but
she
was
almost
at
the
door
-
stones
already
,
scampering
round
the
brow
at
full
speed
.
<EOS>
Her
appointed
companion
did
not
pretend
to
escort
her
:
he
shied
off
by
the
road
-
side
,
and
vanished
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
it
's
very
wrong
,
"
I
continued
:
"
<EOS>
you
know
you
mean
no
good
.
<EOS>
And
there
she
'll
see
Linton
,
and
all
will
be
told
as
soon
as
ever
we
return
;
and
I
shall
have
the
blame
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
her
to
see
Linton
,
"
he
answered
;
"
he
's
looking
better
these
few
days
;
it
's
not
often
he
's
fit
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
And
we
'll
soon
persuade
her
to
keep
the
visit
secret
:
<EOS>
where
is
the
harm
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
harm
of
it
is
,
that
her
father
would
hate
me
if
he
found
I
suffered
her
to
enter
your
house
;
and
I
am
convinced
you
have
a
bad
design
in
encouraging
her
to
do
so
,
"
I
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
design
is
as
honest
as
possible
.
<EOS>
I
'll
inform
you
of
its
whole
scope
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
That
the
two
cousins
may
fall
in
love
,
and
get
married
.
<EOS>
I
'm
acting
generously
to
your
master
:
<EOS>
his
young
chit
has
no
expectations
,
and
should
she
second
my
wishes
<EOS>
she
'll
be
provided
for
at
once
as
joint
successor
with
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
Linton
died
,
"
I
answered
,
"
and
his
life
is
quite
uncertain
,
Catherine
would
be
the
heir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
she
would
not
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
clause
in
the
will
to
secure
it
so
:
his
property
would
go
to
me
;
but
,
to
prevent
disputes
,
I
desire
their
union
,
and
am
resolved
to
bring
it
about
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
'm
resolved
she
shall
never
approach
your
house
with
me
again
,
"
I
returned
,
as
we
reached
the
gate
,
where
Miss
Cathy
waited
our
coming
.
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
bade
<EOS>
me
be
quiet
;
and
,
preceding
us
up
the
path
,
<EOS>
hastened
to
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
My
young
lady
gave
him
several
looks
,
as
if
she
could
not
exactly
make
up
her
mind
what
to
think
of
him
;
but
now
he
smiled
when
he
met
her
eye
,
and
softened
his
voice
in
addressing
her
;
and
I
was
foolish
enough
to
imagine
the
memory
of
her
mother
might
disarm
him
from
desiring
her
injury
.
<EOS>
Linton
stood
on
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
out
walking
in
the
fields
,
for
his
cap
was
on
,
and
he
was
calling
to
Joseph
to
bring
him
dry
shoes
.
<EOS>
He
had
grown
tall
of
his
age
,
still
wanting
some
months
of
sixteen
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
pretty
yet
,
and
his
eye
and
complexion
brighter
than
I
remembered
them
,
though
with
merely
temporary
lustre
borrowed
from
the
salubrious
air
and
genial
sun
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
who
is
that
?
"
asked
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
turning
to
Cathy
.
"
<EOS>
Can
you
tell
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Your
son
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
having
doubtfully
surveyed
,
first
one
and
then
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
answered
he
:
"
<EOS>
but
is
this
the
only
time
you
have
beheld
him
?
<EOS>
Think
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
have
a
short
memory
.
<EOS>
Linton
,
do
n't
you
recall
your
cousin
,
that
you
used
to
tease
us
so
with
wishing
to
see
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
Linton
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Cathy
,
kindling
into
joyful
surprise
at
the
name
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
that
little
Linton
?
<EOS>
He
's
taller
than
I
am
!
<EOS>
Are
you
Linton
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
youth
stepped
forward
,
and
acknowledged
himself
:
<EOS>
she
kissed
him
fervently
,
and
they
gazed
with
wonder
at
the
change
time
had
wrought
in
the
appearance
of
each
.
<EOS>
Catherine
had
reached
her
full
height
;
her
figure
was
both
plump
and
slender
,
elastic
as
steel
,
and
her
whole
aspect
sparkling
with
health
and
spirits
.
<EOS>
Linton
's
looks
and
movements
were
very
languid
,
and
his
form
extremely
slight
;
but
there
was
a
grace
in
his
manner
that
mitigated
these
defects
,
and
rendered
him
not
unpleasing
.
<EOS>
After
exchanging
numerous
marks
of
fondness
with
him
,
his
cousin
went
to
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
who
lingered
by
the
door
,
dividing
his
attention
between
the
objects
inside
and
those
that
lay
without
:
pretending
,
that
is
,
to
observe
the
latter
,
and
really
noting
the
former
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
my
uncle
,
then
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
reaching
up
to
salute
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
liked
you
,
though
you
were
cross
at
first
.
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
visit
at
the
Grange
with
Linton
?
<EOS>
To
live
all
these
years
such
close
neighbours
,
and
never
see
us
,
is
odd
:
what
have
you
done
so
for
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
visited
it
once
or
twice
too
often
before
you
were
born
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
There
 
damn
it
!
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
kisses
to
spare
,
give
them
to
Linton
:
they
are
thrown
away
on
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Naughty
Ellen
!
"
exclaimed
Catherine
,
flying
to
attack
me
next
with
her
lavish
caresses
.
"
<EOS>
Wicked
Ellen
!
<EOS>
to
try
to
hinder
me
from
entering
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
take
this
walk
every
morning
in
future
:
<EOS>
may
I
,
uncle
?
<EOS>
and
sometimes
bring
papa
.
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
be
glad
to
see
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
replied
the
uncle
,
with
a
hardly
suppressed
grimace
,
resulting
from
his
deep
aversion
to
both
the
proposed
visitors
.
"
<EOS>
But
stay
,
"
he
continued
,
turning
towards
the
young
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
I
think
of
it
,
I
'd
better
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
has
a
prejudice
against
me
:
we
quarrelled
at
one
time
of
our
lives
,
with
unchristian
ferocity
;
and
,
if
you
mention
coming
here
to
him
,
he
'll
put
a
veto
on
your
visits
altogether
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
you
must
not
mention
it
,
unless
you
be
careless
of
seeing
your
cousin
hereafter
<EOS>
:
you
may
come
,
if
you
will
,
but
you
must
not
mention
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
quarrel
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Catherine
,
considerably
crestfallen
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
thought
me
too
poor
to
we
d
his
sister
,
"
answered
Heathcliff
,
"
and
was
grieved
that
I
got
her
:
his
pride
was
hurt
,
and
he
'll
never
forgive
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
wrong
!
"
said
the
young
lady
:
"
some
time
I
'll
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
But
Linton
and
I
have
no
share
in
your
quarrel
.
<EOS>
I
'll
not
come
here
,
then
;
he
shall
come
to
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
too
far
for
me
,
"
murmured
her
cousin
:
"
to
walk
four
miles
would
kill
me
.
<EOS>
No
,
come
here
,
Miss
Catherine
,
now
<EOS>
and
then
:
not
every
morning
,
<EOS>
but
once
or
twice
a
week
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
father
launched
towards
his
son
a
glance
of
bitter
contempt
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
Nelly
,
I
shall
lose
my
labour
,
"
he
muttered
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Catherine
,
as
the
ninny
calls
her
,
will
discover
his
value
,
and
send
him
to
the
devil
.
<EOS>
Now
,
if
it
had
been
Hareton
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
that
,
twenty
times
a
day
,
I
covet
Hareton
,
with
all
his
degradation
?
<EOS>
I
'd
have
loved
the
lad
<EOS>
had
he
been
some
one
else
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
he
's
safe
from
_
her
_
love
.
<EOS>
I
'll
pit
him
against
that
paltry
creature
,
unless
it
bestir
itself
briskly
.
<EOS>
We
calculate
it
will
scarcely
last
till
it
is
eighteen
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
confound
the
vapid
thing
!
<EOS>
He
's
absorbed
in
drying
his
feet
,
and
never
looks
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
Linton
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
father
,
"
answered
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
nothing
to
show
your
cousin
anywhere
about
,
not
even
a
rabbit
or
a
weasel
's
nest
?
<EOS>
Take
her
into
the
garden
,
before
you
change
your
shoes
;
and
into
the
stable
to
see
your
horse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
n't
you
rather
sit
here
?
"
asked
Linton
,
addressing
Cathy
in
a
tone
which
expressed
reluctance
to
move
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
she
replied
,
casting
a
longing
look
to
the
door
,
and
evidently
eager
to
be
active
.
  
<EOS>
He
kept
his
seat
,
and
shrank
closer
to
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
rose
,
and
went
into
the
kitchen
,
and
from
thence
to
the
yard
,
calling
out
for
Hareton
.
<EOS>
Hareton
responded
,
and
presently
the
two
re
-
entered
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
had
been
washing
himself
,
as
was
visible
by
the
glow
on
his
cheeks
and
his
wetted
hair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
'll
ask
_
you
_
,
uncle
,
"
cried
Miss
Cathy
,
recollecting
the
housekeeper
's
assertion
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
my
cousin
,
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
,
replied
,
"
your
mother
's
nephew
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
like
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
looked
queer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
not
a
handsome
lad
?
"
<EOS>
he
continued
.
  
<EOS>
The
uncivil
little
thing
stood
on
tiptoe
,
and
whispered
a
sentence
in
Heathcliff
's
ear
.
<EOS>
He
laughed
;
Hareton
darkened
:
<EOS>
I
perceived
he
was
very
sensitive
to
suspected
slights
,
and
had
obviously
a
dim
notion
of
his
inferiority
.
<EOS>
But
his
master
or
guardian
chased
the
frown
by
exclaiming
    
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
the
favourite
among
us
,
Hareton
!
<EOS>
She
says
you
are
a
 
<EOS>
What
was
it
?
<EOS>
Well
,
something
very
flattering
.
<EOS>
Here
!
<EOS>
you
go
with
her
round
the
farm
.
<EOS>
And
behave
like
a
gentleman
,
mind
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
use
any
bad
words
;
and
do
n't
stare
when
the
young
lady
is
not
looking
at
you
,
and
be
ready
to
hide
your
face
when
she
is
;
and
,
when
you
speak
,
say
your
words
slowly
,
and
keep
your
hands
out
of
your
pockets
.
<EOS>
Be
off
,
and
entertain
her
as
nicely
as
you
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
watched
the
couple
walking
past
the
window
.
<EOS>
Earnshaw
had
his
countenance
completely
averted
from
his
companion
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
studying
the
familiar
landscape
with
a
stranger
's
and
an
artist
's
interest
.
<EOS>
Catherine
took
a
sly
look
at
him
,
expressing
small
admiration
.
<EOS>
She
then
turned
her
attention
to
seeking
out
objects
of
amusement
for
herself
,
and
tripped
merrily
on
,
lilting
a
tune
to
supply
the
lack
of
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
tied
his
tongue
,
"
observed
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
He
'll
not
venture
a
single
syllable
all
the
time
!
<EOS>
Nelly
,
you
recollect
me
at
his
age
 
<EOS>
nay
,
some
years
younger
.
<EOS>
Did
I
ever
look
so
stupid
:
so
"
gaumless
,
"
as
Joseph
calls
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Worse
,
"
I
replied
,
"
because
more
sullen
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
a
pleasure
in
him
,
"
he
continued
,
reflecting
aloud
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
satisfied
my
expectations
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
a
born
fool
I
should
not
enjoy
it
half
so
much
.
<EOS>
But
he
's
no
fool
;
and
I
can
sympathise
with
all
his
feelings
,
having
felt
them
myself
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
he
suffers
now
,
for
instance
,
exactly
:
it
is
merely
a
beginning
of
what
he
shall
suffer
,
though
.
<EOS>
And
he
'll
never
be
able
to
emerge
from
his
bathos
of
coarseness
and
ignorance
.
<EOS>
I
've
got
him
faster
than
his
scoundrel
of
a
father
secured
me
,
and
lower
;
for
he
takes
a
pride
in
his
brutishness
.
<EOS>
I
've
taught
him
to
scorn
everything
extra
-
animal
as
silly
and
weak
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
Hindley
would
be
proud
of
his
son
,
if
he
could
see
him
?
<EOS>
almost
as
proud
as
I
am
of
mine
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
this
difference
;
one
is
gold
put
to
the
use
of
paving
-
stones
,
and
the
other
is
tin
polished
to
ape
a
service
of
silver
.
<EOS>
_
Mine
_
has
nothing
valuable
about
it
;
yet
I
shall
have
the
merit
of
making
it
go
as
far
as
such
poor
stuff
can
go
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
His
_
had
first
-
rate
qualities
,
and
they
are
lost
:
rendered
worse
than
unavailing
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
regret
;
he
would
have
more
than
any
<EOS>
but
I
are
aware
of
.
<EOS>
And
the
best
of
it
is
,
Hareton
is
damnably
fond
of
me
!
<EOS>
You
'll
own
that
I
've
outmatched
Hindley
there
.
<EOS>
If
the
dead
villain
could
rise
from
his
grave
to
abuse
me
for
his
offspring
's
wrongs
,
I
should
have
the
fun
of
seeing
the
said
offspring
fight
him
back
again
,
indignant
that
he
should
dare
to
rail
at
the
one
friend
he
has
in
the
world
!
"
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
chuckled
a
fiendish
laugh
at
the
idea
.
<EOS>
I
made
no
reply
,
because
I
saw
that
he
expected
none
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
our
young
companion
,
who
sat
too
removed
from
us
to
hear
what
was
said
,
began
to
evince
symptoms
of
uneasiness
,
probably
repenting
that
he
had
denied
himself
the
treat
of
Catherine
's
society
for
fear
of
a
little
fatigue
.
<EOS>
His
father
remarked
the
restless
glances
wandering
to
the
window
,
and
the
hand
irresolutely
extended
towards
his
cap
.
  
<EOS>
"
Get
up
,
you
idle
boy
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
with
assumed
heartiness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Away
after
them
!
<EOS>
they
are
just
at
the
corner
,
by
the
stand
of
hives
.
"
  
<EOS>
Linton
gathered
his
energies
,
and
left
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
The
lattice
was
open
,
and
,
as
he
stepped
out
,
I
heard
Cathy
inquiring
of
her
unsociable
attendant
<EOS>
what
was
that
inscription
over
the
door
?
<EOS>
Hareton
stared
up
,
and
scratched
his
head
like
a
true
clown
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
some
damnable
writing
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
read
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
read
it
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Catherine
<EOS>
;
"
I
can
read
it
:
it
's
English
.
<EOS>
But
I
want
to
know
why
it
is
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
Linton
giggled
:
the
first
appearance
of
mirth
he
had
exhibited
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
does
not
know
his
letters
,
"
he
said
to
his
cousin
.
"
<EOS>
Could
you
believe
in
the
existence
of
such
a
colossal
dunce
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
all
as
he
should
be
?
"
asked
Miss
Cathy
,
seriously
;
"
or
is
he
simple
:
not
right
?
<EOS>
I
've
questioned
him
twice
now
,
and
each
time
he
looked
so
stupid
<EOS>
I
think
he
does
not
understand
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
understand
him
,
I
'm
sure
!
"
  
<EOS>
Linton
repeated
his
laugh
,
and
glanced
at
Hareton
tauntingly
;
who
certainly
did
not
seem
quite
clear
of
comprehension
at
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
the
matter
but
laziness
;
is
there
,
Earnshaw
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
My
cousin
fancies
you
are
an
idiot
.
<EOS>
There
you
experience
the
consequence
of
scorning
"
book
-
larning
,
"
as
you
would
say
.
<EOS>
Have
you
noticed
,
Catherine
,
his
frightful
Yorkshire
pronunciation
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
where
the
devil
is
the
use
on't
?
"
<EOS>
growled
Hareton
,
more
ready
in
answering
his
daily
companion
.
<EOS>
He
was
about
to
enlarge
further
,
but
the
two
youngsters
broke
into
a
noisy
fit
of
merriment
:
<EOS>
my
giddy
miss
being
delighted
to
discover
that
she
might
turn
his
strange
talk
to
matter
of
amusement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
use
of
the
devil
in
that
sentence
?
"
tittered
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
Papa
told
you
not
to
say
any
bad
words
,
and
you
ca
n't
open
your
mouth
without
one
.
<EOS>
Do
try
to
behave
like
a
gentleman
,
now
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
thou
were
n't
more
a
lass
than
a
lad
,
I
'd
fell
thee
this
minute
,
I
would
;
pitiful
lath
of
a
crater
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
the
angry
boor
,
retreating
,
while
his
face
burnt
with
mingled
rage
and
mortification
!
<EOS>
for
he
was
conscious
of
being
insulted
,
and
embarrassed
how
to
resent
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
having
overheard
the
conversation
,
as
well
as
I
,
smiled
when
he
saw
him
go
;
but
immediately
afterwards
cast
a
look
of
singular
aversion
on
the
flippant
pair
,
who
remained
chattering
in
the
door
-
way
:
the
boy
finding
animation
enough
while
discussing
Hareton
's
faults
and
deficiencies
,
and
relating
anecdotes
of
his
goings
on
;
and
the
girl
relishing
his
pert
and
spiteful
sayings
,
without
considering
the
ill
-
nature
they
evinced
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
dislike
,
more
than
to
compassionate
Linton
,
and
to
excuse
his
father
in
some
measure
for
holding
him
cheap
.
  
<EOS>
We
stayed
till
afternoon
:
I
could
not
tear
Miss
Cathy
away
sooner
;
but
happily
my
master
had
not
quitted
his
apartment
,
and
remained
ignorant
of
our
prolonged
absence
.
<EOS>
As
we
walked
home
,
I
would
fain
have
enlightened
my
charge
on
the
characters
of
the
people
we
had
quitted
:
but
she
got
it
into
her
head
that
I
was
prejudiced
against
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
she
cried
,
"
you
take
papa
's
side
,
Ellen
:
<EOS>
you
are
partial
I
know
;
or
else
you
would
n't
have
cheated
me
so
many
years
into
the
notion
that
Linton
lived
a
long
way
from
here
.
<EOS>
I
'm
really
extremely
angry
;
only
I
'm
so
pleased
I
ca
n't
show
it
!
<EOS>
But
you
must
hold
your
tongue
about
_
my
_
uncle
;
he
's
my
uncle
,
remember
;
and
I
'll
scold
papa
for
quarrelling
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
she
ran
on
,
till
I
relinquished
the
endeavour
to
convince
her
of
her
mistake
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
mention
the
visit
that
night
,
because
she
did
not
see
Mr.
Linton
.
<EOS>
Next
day
it
all
came
out
,
sadly
to
my
chagrin
;
and
still
I
was
not
altogether
sorry
<EOS>
:
I
thought
the
burden
of
directing
and
warning
would
be
more
efficiently
borne
by
him
than
me
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
too
timid
in
giving
satisfactory
reasons
for
his
wish
that
she
should
shun
connection
with
the
household
of
the
Heights
,
and
Catherine
liked
good
reasons
for
every
restraint
that
harassed
her
petted
will
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
after
the
morning
's
salutations
,
"
guess
whom
I
saw
yesterday
,
in
my
walk
on
the
moors
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
papa
,
you
started
!
<EOS>
you
've
not
done
right
,
have
you
,
now
?
<EOS>
I
saw
 
but
listen
,
and
you
shall
hear
how
I
found
you
out
;
and
Ellen
,
who
is
in
league
with
you
,
and
yet
pretended
to
pity
me
<EOS>
so
,
when
I
kept
hoping
,
and
was
always
disappointed
about
Linton
's
coming
back
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
gave
a
faithful
account
of
her
excursion
and
its
consequences
;
and
my
master
,
though
he
cast
more
than
one
reproachful
look
at
me
,
said
nothing
till
she
had
concluded
.
<EOS>
Then
he
drew
her
to
him
,
and
asked
if
she
knew
why
he
had
concealed
Linton
's
near
neighbourhood
from
her
?
<EOS>
Could
she
think
it
was
to
deny
her
a
pleasure
that
she
might
harmlessly
enjoy
?
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
because
you
disliked
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
"
she
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
believe
I
care
more
for
my
own
feelings
than
yours
,
Cathy
?
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
was
not
because
I
disliked
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
but
because
Mr.
Heathcliff
dislikes
me
;
and
is
a
most
diabolical
man
,
delighting
to
wrong
and
ruin
those
he
hates
,
if
they
give
him
the
slightest
opportunity
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
you
could
not
keep
up
an
acquaintance
with
your
cousin
without
being
brought
into
contact
with
him
;
and
I
knew
he
would
detest
you
on
my
account
;
so
for
your
own
good
,
and
nothing
else
,
I
took
precautions
that
you
should
not
see
Linton
again
.
<EOS>
I
meant
to
explain
this
some
time
as
you
grew
older
,
and
I
'm
sorry
I
delayed
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Mr.
Heathcliff
was
quite
cordial
,
papa
,
"
observed
Catherine
,
not
at
all
convinced
;
"
and
he
did
n't
object
to
our
seeing
each
other
:
he
said
I
might
come
to
his
house
when
I
pleased
;
only
I
must
not
tell
you
,
because
you
had
quarrelled
with
him
,
and
would
not
forgive
him
for
marrying
aunt
Isabella
.
<EOS>
And
you
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
are
the
one
to
be
blamed
:
he
is
willing
to
let
us
be
friends
,
at
least
;
Linton
and
I
;
and
you
are
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
master
,
perceiving
that
she
would
not
take
his
word
for
her
uncle
-
in
-
law
's
evil
disposition
,
gave
a
hasty
sketch
of
his
conduct
to
Isabella
,
and
the
manner
in
which
Wuthering
Heights
became
his
property
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
to
discourse
long
upon
the
topic
;
for
though
he
spoke
little
of
it
,
he
still
felt
the
same
horror
and
detestation
of
his
ancient
enemy
that
had
occupied
his
heart
ever
since
Mrs.
Linton
's
death
.
<EOS>
"
She
might
have
been
living
yet
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
him
!
"
was
his
constant
bitter
reflection
;
and
,
in
his
eyes
,
Heathcliff
seemed
a
murderer
.
<EOS>
Miss
Cathy
 
<EOS>
conversant
with
no
bad
deeds
except
her
own
slight
acts
of
disobedience
,
injustice
,
and
passion
,
arising
from
hot
temper
and
thoughtlessness
,
and
repented
of
on
the
day
they
were
committed
 
was
amazed
at
the
blackness
of
spirit
that
could
brood
on
and
cover
revenge
for
years
,
and
deliberately
prosecute
its
plans
without
a
visitation
of
remorse
.
<EOS>
She
appeared
so
deeply
impressed
and
shocked
at
this
new
view
of
human
nature
 
excluded
from
all
her
studies
and
all
her
ideas
till
now
 
that
Mr.
Edgar
deemed
it
unnecessary
to
pursue
the
subject
.
<EOS>
He
merely
added
:
"
You
will
know
hereafter
,
darling
,
why
I
wish
you
to
avoid
his
house
and
family
;
now
return
to
your
old
employments
and
amusements
,
and
think
no
more
about
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
kissed
her
father
,
and
sat
down
quietly
to
her
lessons
for
a
couple
of
hours
,
according
to
custom
;
then
she
accompanied
him
into
the
grounds
,
and
the
whole
day
passed
as
usual
:
but
in
the
evening
,
when
she
had
retired
to
her
room
,
and
I
went
to
help
her
to
undress
<EOS>
,
I
found
her
crying
,
on
her
knees
by
the
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
fie
,
silly
child
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
any
real
griefs
you
'd
be
ashamed
to
waste
a
tear
on
this
little
contrariety
.
<EOS>
You
never
had
one
shadow
of
substantial
sorrow
,
Miss
Catherine
.
<EOS>
Suppose
,
for
a
minute
,
that
master
and
I
were
dead
,
and
you
were
by
yourself
in
the
world
:
<EOS>
how
would
you
feel
,
then
?
<EOS>
Compare
the
present
occasion
with
such
an
affliction
as
that
,
and
be
thankful
for
the
friends
you
have
,
instead
of
coveting
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
crying
for
myself
,
Ellen
,
"
she
answered
,
"
it
's
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
expected
to
see
me
again
to
-
morrow
,
and
there
he
'll
be
so
disappointed
:
and
he
'll
wait
for
me
,
and
I
sha'n't
come
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
"
do
you
imagine
he
has
thought
as
much
of
you
as
you
have
of
him
?
<EOS>
Has
n't
he
Hareton
for
a
companion
?
<EOS>
Not
one
in
a
hundred
would
weep
at
losing
a
relation
they
had
just
seen
twice
,
for
two
afternoons
.
<EOS>
Linton
will
conjecture
how
it
is
,
and
trouble
himself
no
further
about
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
may
I
not
write
a
note
to
tell
him
why
I
can
not
come
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
rising
to
her
feet
.
"
<EOS>
And
just
send
those
books
I
promised
to
lend
him
?
<EOS>
His
books
are
not
as
nice
as
mine
,
and
he
wanted
to
have
them
extremely
,
when
I
told
him
how
interesting
they
were
.
<EOS>
May
I
not
,
Ellen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
replied
I
with
decision
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
would
write
to
you
,
and
there
'd
never
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
No
,
Miss
Catherine
,
the
acquaintance
must
be
dropped
entirely
:
so
papa
expects
,
and
I
shall
see
that
it
is
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
can
one
little
note
 
?
<EOS>
"
she
recommenced
,
putting
on
an
imploring
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Silence
!
<EOS>
"
I
interrupted
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
not
begin
with
your
little
notes
.
<EOS>
Get
into
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
threw
at
me
a
very
naughty
look
,
so
naughty
that
I
would
not
kiss
her
good
-
night
at
first
<EOS>
:
I
covered
her
up
,
and
shut
her
door
,
in
great
displeasure
;
but
,
repenting
half
-
way
,
I
returned
softly
,
and
lo
!
<EOS>
there
was
Miss
standing
at
the
table
with
a
bit
of
blank
paper
before
her
and
a
pencil
in
her
hand
,
which
she
guiltily
slipped
out
of
sight
on
my
entrance
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
get
nobody
to
take
that
,
Catherine
,
"
I
said
,
"
if
you
write
it
;
and
at
present
I
shall
put
out
your
candle
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
set
the
extinguisher
on
the
flame
,
receiving
as
I
did
so
a
slap
on
my
hand
and
a
petulant
"
cross
thing
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
then
quitted
her
again
,
and
she
drew
the
bolt
in
one
of
her
worst
,
most
peevish
humours
.
<EOS>
The
letter
was
finished
and
forwarded
to
its
destination
by
a
milk
-
fetcher
who
came
from
the
village
;
but
that
I
did
n't
learn
till
some
time
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Weeks
passed
on
,
and
Cathy
recovered
her
temper
;
though
she
grew
wondrous
fond
of
stealing
off
to
corners
by
herself
and
often
,
if
I
came
near
her
suddenly
while
reading
,
she
would
start
and
bend
over
the
book
,
evidently
desirous
to
hide
it
;
and
I
detected
edges
of
loose
paper
sticking
out
beyond
the
leaves
.
<EOS>
She
also
got
a
trick
of
coming
down
early
in
the
morning
and
lingering
about
the
kitchen
,
as
if
she
were
expecting
the
arrival
of
something
;
and
she
had
a
small
drawer
in
a
cabinet
in
the
library
,
which
she
would
trifle
over
for
hours
,
and
whose
key
she
took
special
care
to
remove
when
she
left
it
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
,
as
she
inspected
this
drawer
,
I
observed
that
the
playthings
and
trinkets
which
recently
formed
its
contents
were
transmuted
into
bits
of
folded
paper
.
<EOS>
My
curiosity
and
suspicions
were
roused
;
I
determined
to
take
a
peep
at
her
mysterious
treasures
;
so
,
at
night
,
as
soon
as
she
and
my
master
were
safe
upstairs
,
I
searched
,
and
readily
found
among
my
house
keys
one
that
would
fit
the
lock
.
<EOS>
Having
opened
,
I
emptied
the
whole
contents
into
my
apron
,
and
took
them
with
me
to
examine
at
leisure
in
my
own
chamber
.
<EOS>
Though
I
could
not
but
suspect
,
I
was
still
surprised
to
discover
that
they
were
a
mass
of
correspondence
 
daily
almost
<EOS>
,
it
must
have
been
 
from
Linton
Heathcliff
:
<EOS>
answers
to
documents
forwarded
by
her
.
<EOS>
The
earlier
dated
were
embarrassed
and
short
;
gradually
,
however
,
they
expanded
into
copious
love
-
letters
,
foolish
,
as
the
age
of
the
writer
rendered
natural
,
yet
with
touches
here
and
there
which
I
thought
were
borrowed
from
a
more
experienced
source
.
<EOS>
Some
of
them
struck
me
as
singularly
odd
compounds
of
ardour
and
flatness
;
commencing
in
strong
feeling
,
and
concluding
in
the
affected
,
wordy
style
that
a
schoolboy
might
use
to
a
fancied
,
incorporeal
sweetheart
.
<EOS>
Whether
they
satisfied
Cathy
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
;
but
they
appeared
very
worthless
trash
to
me
.
<EOS>
After
turning
over
as
many
as
I
thought
proper
,
I
tied
them
in
a
handkerchief
and
set
them
aside
,
relocking
the
vacant
drawer
.
  
<EOS>
Following
her
habit
,
my
young
lady
descended
early
,
and
visited
the
kitchen
:
I
watched
her
go
to
the
door
,
on
the
arrival
of
a
certain
little
boy
;
and
,
while
the
dairymaid
filled
his
can
,
she
tucked
something
into
his
jacket
pocket
,
and
plucked
something
out
.
<EOS>
I
went
round
by
the
garden
,
and
laid
wait
for
the
messenger
;
who
fought
valorously
to
defend
his
trust
,
and
we
spilt
the
milk
between
us
;
but
I
succeeded
in
abstracting
the
epistle
;
and
,
threatening
serious
consequences
if
he
did
not
look
sharp
home
,
I
remained
under
the
wall
and
perused
Miss
Cathy
's
affectionate
composition
.
<EOS>
It
was
more
simple
and
more
eloquent
than
her
cousin
's
:
very
pretty
and
very
silly
.
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
,
and
went
meditating
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
day
being
wet
,
she
could
not
divert
herself
with
rambling
about
the
park
;
so
,
at
the
conclusion
of
her
morning
studies
,
she
resorted
to
the
solace
of
the
drawer
.
<EOS>
Her
father
sat
reading
at
the
table
;
and
I
,
on
purpose
,
had
sought
a
bit
of
work
in
some
unripped
fringes
of
the
window
-
curtain
,
keeping
my
eye
steadily
fixed
on
her
proceedings
.
<EOS>
Never
did
any
bird
flying
back
to
a
plundered
nest
,
which
it
had
left
brimful
of
chirping
young
ones
,
express
more
complete
despair
,
in
its
anguished
cries
and
flutterings
,
than
she
by
her
single
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
and
the
change
that
transfigured
her
late
happy
countenance
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
looked
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
,
love
?
<EOS>
Have
you
hurt
yourself
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
His
tone
and
look
assured
her
_
<EOS>
he
_
had
not
been
the
discoverer
of
the
hoard
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
papa
!
<EOS>
"
she
gasped
.
"
<EOS>
Ellen
!
<EOS>
Ellen
!
<EOS>
come
up
-
stairs
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sick
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
obeyed
her
summons
,
and
accompanied
her
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Ellen
!
<EOS>
you
have
got
them
,
"
she
commenced
immediately
,
dropping
on
her
knees
,
when
we
were
enclosed
alone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
give
them
to
me
,
and
I
'll
never
,
never
do
so
again
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
tell
papa
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
told
papa
,
Ellen
?
<EOS>
say
you
have
not
?
<EOS>
I
've
been
exceedingly
naughty
,
but
I
wo
n't
do
it
any
more
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
grave
severity
in
my
manner
I
bade
her
stand
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
,
"
I
exclaimed
,
"
Miss
Catherine
,
you
are
tolerably
far
on
<EOS>
,
it
seems
:
you
may
well
be
ashamed
of
them
!
<EOS>
A
fine
bundle
of
trash
you
study
in
your
leisure
hours
,
to
be
sure
<EOS>
:
why
,
it
's
good
enough
to
be
printed
!
<EOS>
And
what
do
you
suppose
the
master
will
think
when
I
display
it
before
him
?
<EOS>
I
hav'n"t
shown
it
yet
,
but
you
need
n't
imagine
I
shall
keep
your
ridiculous
secrets
.
<EOS>
For
shame
!
<EOS>
and
you
must
have
led
the
way
in
writing
such
absurdities
:
he
would
not
have
thought
of
beginning
,
I
'm
certain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
!
<EOS>
I
did
n't
!
"
<EOS>
sobbed
Cathy
,
fit
to
break
her
heart
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
once
think
of
loving
him
till
 
"
  
"
_
Loving
_
!
"
<EOS>
cried
I
,
as
scornfully
as
I
could
utter
the
word
.
"
<EOS>
_
Loving
_
!
<EOS>
Did
anybody
ever
hear
the
like
!
<EOS>
I
might
just
as
well
talk
of
loving
the
miller
who
comes
once
a
year
to
buy
our
corn
.
<EOS>
Pretty
loving
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
both
times
together
you
have
seen
Linton
hardly
four
hours
in
your
life
!
<EOS>
Now
here
is
the
babyish
trash
.
<EOS>
I
'm
going
with
it
to
the
library
;
and
we
'll
see
what
your
father
says
to
such
_
loving
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
sprang
at
her
precious
epistles
,
but
I
held
them
above
my
head
;
and
then
she
poured
out
further
frantic
entreaties
that
I
would
burn
them
 
<EOS>
do
anything
rather
than
show
them
.
<EOS>
And
being
really
fully
as
much
inclined
to
laugh
as
scold
 
<EOS>
for
I
esteemed
it
all
girlish
vanity
 
<EOS>
I
at
length
relented
in
a
measure
,
and
asked
,
 
"
If
I
consent
to
burn
them
,
will
you
promise
faithfully
neither
to
send
nor
receive
a
letter
again
,
nor
a
book
(
for
I
perceive
you
have
sent
him
books
)
,
nor
locks
of
hair
,
nor
rings
,
nor
playthings
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't
send
playthings
,
"
cried
Catherine
,
her
pride
overcoming
her
shame
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
anything
at
all
,
then
,
my
lady
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Unless
you
will
,
here
I
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
promise
,
Ellen
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
catching
my
dress
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
put
them
in
the
fire
,
do
,
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
when
I
proceeded
to
open
a
place
with
the
poker
the
sacrifice
was
too
painful
to
be
borne
.
<EOS>
She
earnestly
supplicated
that
I
would
spare
her
one
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
or
two
,
Ellen
,
to
keep
for
Linton
's
sake
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
unknotted
the
handkerchief
,
and
commenced
dropping
them
in
from
an
angle
,
and
the
flame
curled
up
the
chimney
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
one
,
you
cruel
wretch
!
<EOS>
"
she
screamed
,
darting
her
hand
into
the
fire
,
and
drawing
forth
some
half
-
consumed
fragments
,
at
the
expense
of
her
fingers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
have
some
to
exhibit
to
papa
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
answered
,
shaking
back
the
rest
into
the
bundle
,
and
turning
anew
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
She
emptied
her
blackened
pieces
into
the
flames
,
and
motioned
me
to
finish
the
immolation
.
<EOS>
It
was
done
;
I
stirred
up
the
ashes
,
and
interred
them
under
a
shovelful
of
coals
;
and
she
mutely
,
and
with
a
sense
of
intense
injury
,
retired
to
her
private
apartment
.
<EOS>
I
descended
to
tell
my
master
that
the
young
lady
's
qualm
of
sickness
was
almost
gone
,
but
I
judged
it
best
for
her
to
lie
down
a
while
.
<EOS>
She
would
n't
dine
;
but
she
reappeared
at
tea
,
pale
,
and
red
about
the
eyes
,
and
marvellously
subdued
in
outward
aspect
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
I
answered
the
letter
by
a
slip
of
paper
,
inscribed
,
"
Master
Heathcliff
is
requested
to
send
no
more
notes
to
Miss
Linton
,
as
she
will
not
receive
them
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
henceforth
,
the
little
boy
came
with
vacant
pockets
.
    
<EOS>
Summer
drew
to
an
end
,
and
early
autumn
:
it
was
past
Michaelmas
,
but
the
harvest
was
late
that
year
,
and
a
few
of
our
fields
were
still
uncleared
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
and
his
daughter
would
frequently
walk
out
among
the
reapers
;
at
the
carrying
of
the
last
sheaves
they
stayed
till
dusk
,
and
the
evening
happening
to
be
chill
and
damp
,
my
master
caught
a
bad
cold
,
that
settled
obstinately
on
his
lungs
,
and
confined
him
indoors
throughout
the
whole
of
the
winter
,
nearly
without
intermission
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Cathy
,
frightened
from
her
little
romance
,
had
been
considerably
sadder
and
duller
since
its
abandonment
;
and
her
father
insisted
on
her
reading
less
,
and
taking
more
exercise
.
<EOS>
She
had
his
companionship
no
longer
;
I
esteemed
it
a
duty
to
supply
its
lack
,
as
much
as
possible
,
with
mine
:
an
inefficient
substitute
;
for
I
could
only
spare
two
or
three
hours
,
from
my
numerous
diurnal
occupations
,
to
follow
her
footsteps
,
and
then
my
society
was
obviously
less
desirable
than
his
.
  
<EOS>
On
an
afternoon
in
October
,
or
the
beginning
of
November
 
a
fresh
watery
afternoon
,
when
the
turf
and
paths
were
rustling
with
moist
,
withered
leaves
,
and
the
cold
blue
sky
was
half
hidden
by
clouds
 
dark
grey
streamers
,
rapidly
mounting
from
the
west
,
and
boding
abundant
rain
 
<EOS>
I
requested
my
young
lady
to
forego
her
ramble
,
because
I
was
certain
of
showers
.
<EOS>
She
refused
;
and
I
unwillingly
donned
a
cloak
,
and
took
my
umbrella
to
accompany
her
on
a
stroll
to
the
bottom
of
the
park
:
a
formal
walk
which
she
generally
affected
if
low
-
spirited
 
and
that
she
invariably
was
when
Mr.
Edgar
had
been
worse
than
ordinary
,
a
thing
never
known
from
his
confession
,
but
guessed
both
by
her
and
me
from
his
increased
silence
and
the
melancholy
of
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
She
went
sadly
on
<EOS>
:
there
was
no
running
or
bounding
now
,
though
the
chill
wind
might
well
have
tempted
her
to
race
.
<EOS>
And
often
,
from
the
side
of
my
eye
,
I
could
detect
her
raising
a
hand
,
and
brushing
something
off
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
I
gazed
round
for
a
means
of
diverting
her
thoughts
.
<EOS>
On
one
side
of
the
road
rose
a
high
,
rough
bank
,
where
hazels
and
stunted
oaks
,
with
their
roots
half
exposed
,
held
uncertain
tenure
:
the
soil
was
too
loose
for
the
latter
;
and
strong
winds
had
blown
some
nearly
horizontal
.
<EOS>
In
summer
Miss
Catherine
delighted
to
climb
along
these
trunks
,
and
sit
in
the
branches
,
swinging
twenty
feet
above
the
ground
;
and
I
,
pleased
with
her
agility
and
her
light
,
childish
heart
,
still
considered
it
proper
to
scold
every
time
I
caught
her
at
such
an
elevation
,
but
so
that
she
knew
there
was
no
necessity
for
descending
.
<EOS>
From
dinner
to
tea
she
would
lie
in
her
breeze
-
rocked
cradle
,
doing
nothing
except
singing
old
songs
 
<EOS>
my
nursery
lore
 
to
herself
,
or
watching
the
birds
,
joint
tenants
,
feed
and
entice
their
young
ones
to
fly
:
or
nestling
with
closed
lids
,
<EOS>
half
thinking
,
half
dreaming
,
happier
than
words
can
express
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
,
Miss
!
"
I
exclaimed
,
pointing
to
a
nook
under
the
roots
of
one
twisted
tree
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Winter
is
not
here
yet
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
little
flower
up
yonder
,
the
last
bud
from
the
multitude
of
bluebells
that
clouded
those
turf
steps
in
July
with
a
lilac
mist
.
<EOS>
Will
you
clamber
up
,
and
pluck
it
to
show
to
papa
?
"
<EOS>
Cathy
stared
a
long
time
at
the
lonely
blossom
trembling
in
its
earthy
shelter
,
and
replied
,
at
length
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
'll
not
touch
it
:
but
it
looks
melancholy
,
does
it
not
,
Ellen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
observed
,
"
about
as
starved
and
suckless
as
you
:
your
cheeks
are
bloodless
;
let
us
take
hold
of
hands
and
run
.
<EOS>
You
're
so
low
,
I
daresay
I
shall
keep
up
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
repeated
,
and
continued
sauntering
on
,
pausing
at
intervals
to
muse
over
a
bit
of
moss
,
or
a
tuft
of
blanched
grass
,
or
a
fungus
spreading
its
bright
orange
among
the
heaps
of
brown
foliage
;
and
,
ever
and
anon
,
her
hand
was
lifted
to
her
averted
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Catherine
,
why
are
you
crying
,
love
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
approaching
and
putting
my
arm
over
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
n't
cry
because
papa
has
a
cold
;
be
thankful
it
is
nothing
worse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
now
put
no
further
restraint
on
her
tears
;
her
breath
was
stifled
by
sobs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
will
be
something
worse
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
what
shall
I
do
when
papa
<EOS>
and
you
leave
me
,
and
I
am
by
myself
?
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
forget
your
words
,
Ellen
;
they
are
always
in
my
ear
.
<EOS>
How
life
will
be
changed
,
how
dreary
the
world
will
be
,
when
papa
and
you
are
dead
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
can
tell
whether
you
wo
n't
die
before
us
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
wrong
to
anticipate
evil
.
<EOS>
We
'll
hope
there
are
years
and
years
to
come
before
any
of
us
go
:
master
is
young
,
and
I
am
strong
,
and
hardly
forty
-
five
.
<EOS>
My
mother
lived
till
eighty
,
a
canty
dame
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
And
suppose
Mr.
Linton
were
spared
till
he
saw
sixty
,
that
would
be
more
years
than
you
have
counted
,
Miss.
<EOS>
And
would
it
not
be
foolish
to
mourn
a
calamity
above
twenty
years
beforehand
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
Aunt
Isabella
was
younger
than
papa
,
"
she
remarked
,
gazing
up
with
timid
hope
to
seek
further
consolation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aunt
Isabella
had
not
you
and
me
to
nurse
her
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
n't
as
happy
as
Master
:
<EOS>
she
had
n't
as
much
to
live
for
.
<EOS>
All
you
need
do
,
is
to
wait
well
on
your
father
,
and
cheer
him
by
letting
him
see
you
cheerful
;
and
avoid
giving
him
anxiety
on
any
subject
:
mind
that
,
Cathy
!
<EOS>
I
'll
not
disguise
but
you
might
kill
him
if
you
were
wild
and
reckless
,
and
cherished
a
foolish
,
fanciful
affection
for
the
son
of
a
person
who
would
be
glad
to
have
him
in
his
grave
;
and
allowed
him
to
discover
that
you
fretted
over
the
separation
he
has
judged
it
expedient
to
make
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fret
about
nothing
on
earth
except
papa
's
illness
,
"
answered
my
companion
.
<EOS>
"
I
care
for
nothing
in
comparison
with
papa
.
<EOS>
And
I
'll
never
 
never
 
<EOS>
oh
,
never
,
while
I
have
my
senses
,
do
an
act
or
say
a
word
to
vex
him
.
<EOS>
I
love
him
better
than
myself
,
Ellen
;
and
I
know
it
by
this
:
I
pray
every
night
that
I
may
live
after
him
;
because
I
would
rather
be
miserable
than
that
he
should
be
:
that
proves
I
love
him
better
than
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
words
,
"
I
replied
.
"
<EOS>
But
deeds
must
prove
it
also
;
and
after
he
is
well
,
remember
you
do
n't
forget
resolutions
formed
in
the
hour
of
fear
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
we
talked
,
we
neared
a
door
that
opened
on
the
road
;
and
my
young
lady
,
lightening
into
sunshine
again
,
climbed
up
and
seated
herself
on
the
top
of
the
wall
,
reaching
over
to
gather
some
hips
that
bloomed
scarlet
on
the
summit
branches
of
the
wild
-
rose
trees
shadowing
the
highway
side
:
the
lower
fruit
had
disappeared
,
but
only
birds
could
touch
the
upper
,
except
from
Cathy
's
present
station
.
<EOS>
In
stretching
to
pull
them
,
her
hat
fell
off
;
and
as
the
door
was
locked
,
she
proposed
scrambling
down
to
recover
it
.
<EOS>
I
bid
her
be
cautious
lest
she
got
a
fall
,
and
she
nimbly
disappeared
.
<EOS>
But
the
return
was
no
such
easy
matter
:
the
stones
were
smooth
and
neatly
cemented
,
and
the
rose
-
bushes
and
black
-
berry
stragglers
could
yield
no
assistance
in
re
-
ascending
.
<EOS>
I
,
like
a
fool
,
did
n't
recollect
that
,
till
I
heard
her
laughing
and
exclaiming
 
"
Ellen
!
<EOS>
you
'll
have
to
fetch
the
key
,
or
else
I
must
run
round
to
the
porter
's
lodge
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
scale
the
ramparts
on
this
side
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
where
you
are
,
"
<EOS>
I
answered
;
"
I
have
my
bundle
of
keys
in
my
pocket
:
perhaps
I
may
manage
to
open
it
;
if
not
,
I
'll
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
amused
herself
with
dancing
to
and
fro
before
the
door
,
while
I
tried
all
the
large
keys
in
succession
.
<EOS>
I
had
applied
the
last
,
and
found
that
none
would
do
;
so
,
repeating
my
desire
that
she
would
remain
there
,
I
was
about
to
hurry
home
as
fast
as
I
could
,
when
an
approaching
sound
arrested
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
trot
of
a
horse
;
Cathy
's
dance
stopped
also
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
that
?
<EOS>
"
I
whispered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ellen
,
I
wish
you
could
open
the
door
,
"
whispered
back
my
companion
,
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ho
,
Miss
Linton
!
"
cried
a
deep
voice
(
the
rider
's
)
,
"
I
'm
glad
to
meet
you
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
in
haste
to
enter
,
for
I
have
an
explanation
to
ask
and
obtain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
sha'n't
speak
to
you
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
"
answered
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Papa
says
you
are
a
wicked
man
,
and
you
hate
both
him
and
me
;
and
Ellen
says
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
nothing
to
the
purpose
,
"
said
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
(
He
it
was
.
)
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
hate
my
son
,
I
suppose
;
and
it
is
concerning
him
that
I
demand
your
attention
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
you
have
cause
to
blush
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
months
since
,
were
you
not
in
the
habit
of
writing
to
Linton
?
<EOS>
making
love
in
play
,
eh
?
<EOS>
You
deserved
,
both
of
you
,
flogging
for
that
!
<EOS>
You
especially
,
the
elder
;
and
less
sensitive
,
as
it
turns
out
.
<EOS>
I
've
got
your
letters
,
and
if
you
give
me
any
pertness
I
'll
send
them
to
your
father
.
<EOS>
I
presume
you
grew
weary
of
the
amusement
and
dropped
it
,
did
n't
you
?
<EOS>
Well
,
you
dropped
Linton
with
it
into
a
Slough
of
Despond
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
earnest
:
in
love
,
really
.
<EOS>
As
true
as
I
live
,
he
's
dying
for
you
;
breaking
his
heart
at
your
fickleness
:
not
figuratively
,
but
actually
.
<EOS>
Though
Hareton
has
made
him
a
standing
jest
for
six
weeks
,
and
I
have
used
more
serious
measures
,
and
attempted
to
frighten
him
out
of
his
idiotcy
,
he
gets
worse
daily
;
and
he
'll
be
under
the
sod
before
summer
,
unless
you
restore
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
lie
so
glaringly
to
the
poor
child
?
<EOS>
"
I
called
from
the
inside
.
"
<EOS>
Pray
ride
on
!
<EOS>
How
can
you
deliberately
get
up
such
paltry
falsehoods
?
<EOS>
Miss
Cathy
,
I
'll
knock
the
lock
off
with
a
stone
:
you
wo
n't
believe
that
vile
nonsense
.
<EOS>
You
can
feel
in
yourself
<EOS>
it
is
impossible
that
a
person
should
die
for
love
of
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
aware
there
were
eavesdroppers
,
"
muttered
the
detected
villain
.
"
<EOS>
Worthy
Mrs.
Dean
,
I
like
you
,
but
I
do
n't
like
your
double
-
dealing
,
"
he
added
aloud
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
could
_
you
<EOS>
_
lie
so
glaringly
as
to
affirm
<EOS>
I
hated
the
"
poor
child
"
?
<EOS>
and
invent
bugbear
stories
to
terrify
her
from
my
door
-
stones
?
<EOS>
Catherine
Linton
(
the
very
name
warms
me
)
,
my
bonny
lass
,
I
shall
be
from
home
all
this
week
;
go
and
see
if
have
not
spoken
truth
<EOS>
:
do
,
there
's
a
darling
!
<EOS>
Just
imagine
your
father
in
my
place
,
and
Linton
in
yours
;
then
think
how
you
would
value
your
careless
lover
if
he
refused
to
stir
a
step
to
comfort
you
,
when
your
father
himself
entreated
him
;
and
do
n't
,
from
pure
stupidity
,
fall
into
the
same
error
.
<EOS>
I
swear
,
on
my
salvation
,
he
's
going
to
his
grave
,
and
none
but
you
can
save
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
lock
gave
way
and
I
issued
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
swear
Linton
is
dying
,
"
repeated
Heathcliff
,
looking
hard
at
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
grief
and
disappointment
are
hastening
his
death
.
<EOS>
Nelly
,
if
you
wo
n't
let
her
go
,
you
can
walk
over
yourself
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
not
return
till
this
time
next
week
;
and
I
think
your
master
himself
would
scarcely
object
to
her
visiting
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
"
said
I
,
taking
Cathy
by
the
arm
and
half
forcing
her
to
re
-
enter
;
for
she
lingered
,
viewing
with
troubled
eyes
the
features
of
the
speaker
,
too
stern
to
express
his
inward
deceit
.
  
<EOS>
He
pushed
his
horse
close
,
and
,
bending
down
,
observed
 
"
Miss
Catherine
<EOS>
,
I
'll
own
to
you
that
I
have
little
patience
with
Linton
;
and
Hareton
and
Joseph
have
less
.
<EOS>
I
'll
own
that
he
's
with
a
harsh
set
.
<EOS>
He
pines
for
kindness
,
as
well
as
love
;
and
a
kind
word
from
you
would
be
his
best
medicine
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
mind
Mrs.
Dean
's
cruel
cautions
;
but
be
generous
,
and
contrive
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
dreams
of
you
day
and
night
,
and
can
not
be
persuaded
that
you
do
n't
hate
him
,
since
you
neither
write
nor
call
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
closed
the
door
,
and
rolled
a
stone
to
assist
the
loosened
lock
in
holding
it
;
and
spreading
my
umbrella
,
I
drew
my
charge
underneath
:
for
the
rain
began
to
drive
through
the
moaning
branches
of
the
trees
,
and
warned
us
to
avoid
delay
.
<EOS>
Our
hurry
prevented
any
comment
on
the
encounter
with
Heathcliff
,
as
we
stretched
towards
home
;
but
I
divined
instinctively
that
Catherine
's
heart
was
clouded
now
in
double
darkness
.
<EOS>
Her
features
were
so
sad
,
they
did
not
seem
hers
:
she
evidently
regarded
what
she
had
heard
as
every
syllable
true
.
  
<EOS>
The
master
had
retired
to
rest
before
we
came
in
.
<EOS>
Cathy
stole
to
his
room
to
inquire
how
he
was
;
he
had
fallen
asleep
.
<EOS>
She
returned
,
and
asked
me
to
sit
with
her
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
We
took
our
tea
together
;
and
afterwards
she
lay
down
on
the
rug
,
and
told
me
not
to
talk
,
for
she
was
weary
.
<EOS>
I
got
a
book
,
and
pretended
to
read
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
supposed
me
absorbed
in
my
occupation
,
she
recommenced
her
silent
weeping
:
it
appeared
,
at
present
,
her
favourite
diversion
.
<EOS>
I
suffered
her
to
enjoy
it
a
while
;
then
I
expostulated
:
deriding
and
ridiculing
all
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
assertions
about
his
son
,
as
if
I
were
certain
she
would
coincide
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
I
had
n't
skill
to
counteract
the
effect
his
account
had
produced
:
it
was
just
what
he
intended
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
right
,
Ellen
,
"
she
answered
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
shall
never
feel
at
ease
till
I
know
.
<EOS>
And
I
must
tell
Linton
it
is
not
my
fault
that
I
do
n't
write
,
and
convince
him
that
I
shall
not
change
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
use
were
anger
and
protestations
against
her
silly
credulity
?
<EOS>
We
parted
that
night
 
hostile
;
but
next
day
beheld
me
on
the
road
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
by
the
side
of
my
wilful
young
mistress
's
pony
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
bear
to
witness
her
sorrow
:
to
see
her
pale
,
dejected
countenance
,
and
heavy
eyes
:
and
I
yielded
,
in
the
faint
hope
that
Linton
himself
might
prove
,
by
his
reception
of
us
,
how
little
of
the
tale
was
founded
on
fact
.
    
<EOS>
The
rainy
night
had
ushered
in
a
misty
morning
 
<EOS>
half
frost
,
half
drizzle
 
and
temporary
brooks
crossed
our
path
 
gurgling
from
the
uplands
.
<EOS>
My
feet
were
thoroughly
wetted
;
I
was
cross
and
low
;
exactly
the
humour
suited
for
making
the
most
of
these
disagreeable
things
.
<EOS>
We
entered
the
farm
-
house
by
the
kitchen
way
,
to
ascertain
whether
Mr.
Heathcliff
were
really
absent
:
because
I
put
slight
faith
in
his
own
affirmation
.
  
<EOS>
Joseph
seemed
sitting
in
a
sort
of
elysium
alone
,
beside
a
roaring
fire
;
a
quart
of
ale
on
the
table
near
him
,
bristling
with
large
pieces
of
toasted
oat
-
cake
;
and
his
black
,
short
pipe
in
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
Catherine
ran
to
the
hearth
to
warm
herself
.
<EOS>
I
asked
if
the
master
was
in
?
<EOS>
My
question
remained
so
long
unanswered
,
that
I
thought
the
old
man
had
grown
deaf
,
and
repeated
it
louder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Na
 
ay
!
"
<EOS>
he
snarled
,
or
rather
screamed
through
his
nose
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Na
 
ay
!
<EOS>
yah
muh
goa
back
whear
yah
coom
frough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Joseph
!
"
cried
a
peevish
voice
,
simultaneously
with
me
,
from
the
inner
room
.
<EOS>
"
How
often
am
I
to
call
you
?
<EOS>
There
are
only
a
few
red
ashes
now
.
<EOS>
Joseph
!
<EOS>
come
this
moment
.
"
  
<EOS>
Vigorous
puffs
,
and
a
resolute
stare
into
the
grate
,
declared
he
had
no
ear
for
this
appeal
.
<EOS>
The
housekeeper
and
Hareton
were
invisible
;
one
gone
on
an
errand
,
and
the
other
at
his
work
,
probably
.
<EOS>
We
knew
Linton
's
tones
,
and
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
hope
you
'll
die
in
a
garret
,
starved
to
death
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
boy
,
mistaking
our
approach
for
that
of
his
negligent
attendant
.
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
on
observing
his
error
:
his
cousin
flew
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
you
,
Miss
Linton
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
raising
his
head
from
the
arm
of
the
great
chair
,
in
which
he
reclined
.
"
<EOS>
No
 
do
n't
kiss
me
:
it
takes
my
breath
.
<EOS>
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
Papa
said
you
would
call
,
"
continued
he
,
after
recovering
a
little
from
Catherine
's
embrace
;
while
she
stood
by
looking
very
contrite
.
"
<EOS>
Will
you
shut
the
door
,
if
you
please
?
<EOS>
you
left
it
open
;
and
those
 
those
_
detestable
_
creatures
wo
n't
bring
coals
to
the
fire
.
<EOS>
It
's
so
cold
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
stirred
up
the
cinders
,
and
fetched
a
scuttleful
myself
.
<EOS>
The
invalid
complained
of
being
covered
with
ashes
;
but
he
had
a
tiresome
cough
,
and
looked
feverish
and
ill
,
so
I
did
not
rebuke
his
temper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Linton
,
"
murmured
Catherine
,
when
his
corrugated
brow
relaxed
,
"
are
you
glad
to
see
me
?
<EOS>
Can
I
do
you
any
good
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
you
come
before
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
come
,
instead
of
writing
.
<EOS>
It
tired
me
dreadfully
writing
those
long
letters
.
<EOS>
I
'd
far
rather
have
talked
to
you
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
can
neither
bear
to
talk
,
nor
anything
else
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
where
Zillah
is
!
<EOS>
Will
you
"
(
looking
at
me
)
<EOS>
"
step
into
the
kitchen
and
see
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
received
no
thanks
for
my
other
service
;
and
being
unwilling
to
run
to
and
fro
at
his
behest
<EOS>
,
I
replied
 
<EOS>
"
Nobody
is
out
there
but
Joseph
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
drink
,
"
he
exclaimed
fretfully
,
turning
away
.
<EOS>
"
Zillah
is
constantly
gadding
off
to
Gimmerton
since
papa
went
:
it
's
miserable
!
<EOS>
And
I
'm
obliged
to
come
down
here
 
<EOS>
they
resolved
never
to
hear
me
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
your
father
attentive
to
you
,
Master
Heathcliff
?
"
I
asked
,
perceiving
Catherine
to
be
checked
in
her
friendly
advances
.
  
<EOS>
"
Attentive
?
<EOS>
He
makes
them
a
little
more
attentive
at
least
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
The
wretches
!
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
Miss
Linton
,
that
brute
Hareton
laughs
at
me
!
<EOS>
I
hate
him
!
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
hate
them
all
:
they
are
odious
beings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Cathy
began
searching
for
some
water
;
she
lighted
on
a
pitcher
in
the
dresser
,
filled
a
tumbler
,
and
brought
it
.
<EOS>
He
bid
her
add
a
spoonful
of
wine
from
a
bottle
on
the
table
;
and
having
swallowed
a
small
portion
,
appeared
more
tranquil
,
and
said
she
was
very
kind
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
are
you
glad
to
see
me
?
"
<EOS>
asked
she
,
reiterating
her
former
question
and
pleased
to
detect
the
faint
dawn
of
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
.
<EOS>
It
's
something
new
to
hear
a
voice
like
yours
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
been
vexed
,
because
you
would
n't
come
.
<EOS>
And
papa
swore
it
was
owing
to
me
:
he
called
me
a
pitiful
,
shuffling
,
worthless
thing
;
and
said
you
despised
me
;
and
if
he
had
been
in
my
place
,
he
would
be
more
the
master
of
the
Grange
than
your
father
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
But
you
do
n't
despise
me
,
do
you
,
<EOS>
Miss
 
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
say
Catherine
,
or
Cathy
,
"
interrupted
my
young
lady
.
<EOS>
"
Despise
you
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
Next
to
papa
and
Ellen
,
I
love
you
better
than
anybody
living
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
love
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
though
;
and
I
dare
not
come
when
he
returns
:
will
he
stay
away
many
days
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
many
,
"
answered
Linton
;
"
but
he
goes
on
to
the
moors
frequently
,
since
the
shooting
season
commenced
;
and
you
might
spend
an
hour
or
two
with
me
in
his
absence
.
<EOS>
Do
say
you
will
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
not
be
peevish
with
you
:
you
'd
not
provoke
me
,
and
you
'd
always
be
ready
to
help
me
,
would
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Catherine
,
stroking
his
long
soft
hair
:
"
if
I
could
only
get
papa
's
consent
,
I
'd
spend
half
my
time
with
you
.
<EOS>
Pretty
Linton
!
<EOS>
I
wish
you
were
my
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
you
would
like
me
as
well
as
your
father
?
"
<EOS>
observed
he
,
more
cheerfully
.
"
<EOS>
But
papa
says
you
would
love
me
better
than
him
and
all
the
world
<EOS>
,
if
you
were
my
wife
;
so
I
'd
rather
you
were
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
should
never
love
anybody
better
than
papa
,
"
she
returned
gravely
.
"
<EOS>
And
people
hate
their
wives
,
sometimes
;
but
not
their
sisters
and
brothers
:
and
if
you
were
the
latter
,
you
would
live
with
us
,
and
papa
would
be
as
fond
of
you
as
he
is
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Linton
denied
that
people
ever
hated
their
wives
;
but
Cathy
affirmed
they
did
,
and
,
in
her
wisdom
,
instanced
his
own
father
's
aversion
to
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
I
endeavoured
to
stop
her
thoughtless
tongue
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
succeed
till
everything
she
knew
was
out
.
<EOS>
Master
Heathcliff
,
much
irritated
,
asserted
her
relation
was
false
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
told
me
;
and
papa
does
not
tell
falsehoods
,
"
she
answered
pertly
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
My
_
papa
scorns
yours
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
calls
him
a
sneaking
fool
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yours
is
a
wicked
man
,
"
retorted
Catherine
;
"
and
you
are
very
naughty
to
dare
to
repeat
what
he
says
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
wicked
to
have
made
Aunt
Isabella
leave
him
as
she
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
did
n't
leave
him
,
"
said
the
boy
;
"
you
sha'n't
contradict
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
did
,
"
cried
my
young
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'll
tell
you
something
!
"
said
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
mother
hated
your
father
:
now
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
"
exclaimed
Catherine
,
too
enraged
to
continue
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
she
loved
mine
,
"
added
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
little
liar
!
<EOS>
I
hate
you
now
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
panted
,
and
her
face
grew
red
with
passion
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
did
!
<EOS>
she
did
!
"
<EOS>
sang
Linton
,
sinking
into
the
recess
of
his
chair
,
and
leaning
back
his
head
to
enjoy
the
agitation
of
the
other
disputant
,
who
stood
behind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
Master
Heathcliff
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
;
"
that
's
your
father
's
tale
,
too
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
is
n't
:
you
hold
your
tongue
!
"
<EOS>
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
She
did
,
she
did
,
Catherine
!
<EOS>
she
did
,
she
did
!
"
  
<EOS>
Cathy
,
beside
herself
,
gave
the
chair
a
violent
push
,
and
caused
him
to
fall
against
one
arm
.
<EOS>
He
was
immediately
seized
by
a
suffocating
cough
that
soon
ended
his
triumph
.
<EOS>
It
lasted
so
long
that
it
frightened
even
me
.
<EOS>
As
to
his
cousin
,
she
wept
with
all
her
might
,
aghast
at
the
mischief
she
had
done
:
though
she
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
held
him
till
the
fit
exhausted
itself
.
<EOS>
Then
he
thrust
me
away
,
and
leant
his
head
down
silently
.
<EOS>
Catherine
quelled
her
lamentations
also
,
took
a
seat
opposite
,
and
looked
solemnly
into
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
feel
now
,
Master
Heathcliff
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
after
waiting
ten
minutes
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
_
<EOS>
she
_
felt
as
I
do
<EOS>
,
"
he
replied
:
"
spiteful
,
cruel
thing
!
<EOS>
Hareton
never
touches
me
:
he
never
struck
me
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
And
I
was
better
to
-
day
:
and
there
 
"
his
voice
died
in
a
whimper
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
I
_
did
n't
strike
you
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Cathy
,
chewing
her
lip
to
prevent
another
burst
of
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
He
sighed
and
moaned
like
one
under
great
suffering
,
and
kept
it
up
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
on
purpose
to
distress
his
cousin
apparently
,
for
whenever
he
caught
a
stifled
sob
from
her
he
put
renewed
pain
and
pathos
into
the
inflexions
of
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
<EOS>
I
hurt
you
,
Linton
,
"
she
said
at
length
,
racked
beyond
endurance
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
could
n't
have
been
hurt
by
that
little
push
,
and
I
had
no
idea
<EOS>
that
you
could
,
either
:
you
're
not
much
,
are
you
,
Linton
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
me
go
home
thinking
<EOS>
I
've
done
you
harm
.
<EOS>
Answer
!
<EOS>
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
speak
to
you
,
<EOS>
"
he
murmured
;
"
you
've
hurt
me
so
that
I
shall
lie
awake
all
night
choking
with
this
cough
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
it
you
'd
know
what
it
was
;
but
_
you
'll
_
be
comfortably
asleep
while
I
'm
in
agony
,
and
nobody
near
me
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
you
would
like
to
pass
those
fearful
nights
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
began
to
wail
aloud
,
for
very
pity
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Since
you
are
in
the
habit
of
passing
dreadful
nights
,
"
I
said
,
"
it
wo
n't
be
Miss
who
spoils
your
ease
:
you
'd
be
the
same
<EOS>
had
she
never
come
.
<EOS>
However
,
she
shall
not
disturb
you
again
;
and
perhaps
you
'll
get
quieter
when
we
leave
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Must
I
go
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Catherine
dolefully
,
bending
over
him
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
want
me
to
go
,
Linton
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
alter
what
you
've
done
,
"
he
replied
pettishly
,
shrinking
from
her
,
"
unless
you
alter
it
for
the
worse
by
teasing
me
into
a
fever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
I
must
go
?
<EOS>
"
she
repeated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
alone
,
at
least
,
"
said
he
;
"
I
ca
n't
bear
your
talking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
lingered
,
and
resisted
my
persuasions
to
departure
a
tiresome
while
;
but
as
he
neither
looked
up
nor
spoke
,
she
finally
made
a
movement
to
the
door
,
and
I
followed
.
<EOS>
We
were
recalled
by
a
scream
.
<EOS>
Linton
had
slid
from
his
seat
on
to
the
hearthstone
,
and
lay
writhing
in
the
mere
perverseness
of
an
indulged
plague
of
a
child
,
determined
to
be
as
grievous
and
harassing
as
it
can
.
<EOS>
I
thoroughly
gauged
his
disposition
from
his
behaviour
,
and
saw
at
once
it
would
be
folly
to
attempt
humouring
him
.
<EOS>
Not
so
my
companion
:
she
ran
back
in
terror
,
knelt
down
,
and
cried
,
and
soothed
,
and
entreated
,
till
he
grew
quiet
from
lack
of
breath
:
by
no
means
from
compunction
at
distressing
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
lift
him
on
to
the
settle
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
he
may
roll
about
as
he
pleases
:
we
ca
n't
stop
to
watch
him
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
satisfied
,
Miss
Cathy
,
that
you
are
not
the
person
to
benefit
him
;
and
that
his
condition
of
health
is
not
occasioned
by
attachment
to
you
.
<EOS>
Now
,
then
,
there
he
is
!
<EOS>
Come
away
:
as
soon
as
he
knows
there
is
nobody
by
to
care
for
his
nonsense
,
he
'll
be
glad
to
lie
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
placed
a
cushion
under
his
head
,
and
offered
him
some
water
;
he
rejected
the
latter
,
and
tossed
uneasily
on
the
former
,
as
if
it
were
a
stone
or
a
block
of
wood
.
<EOS>
She
tried
to
put
it
more
comfortably
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
do
with
that
,
"
he
said
;
"
it
's
not
high
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
brought
another
to
lay
above
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
too
high
,
"
murmured
the
provoking
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
must
I
arrange
it
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
despairingly
.
  
<EOS>
He
twined
himself
up
to
her
,
as
she
half
knelt
by
the
settle
,
and
converted
her
shoulder
into
a
support
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
that
wo
n't
do
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
content
with
the
cushion
,
Master
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
Miss
has
wasted
too
much
time
on
you
already
:
we
can
not
remain
five
minutes
longer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
we
can
!
"
replied
Cathy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
good
and
patient
now
.
<EOS>
He
's
beginning
to
think
I
shall
have
far
greater
misery
<EOS>
than
he
will
to
-
night
,
if
I
believe
he
is
the
worse
for
my
visit
:
and
then
I
dare
not
come
again
.
<EOS>
Tell
the
truth
about
it
,
Linton
;
for
I
musn't
come
,
if
I
have
hurt
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
come
,
to
cure
me
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
come
,
because
you
have
hurt
me
:
you
know
you
have
extremely
!
<EOS>
I
was
not
as
ill
when
you
entered
as
I
am
at
present
 
<EOS>
was
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
've
made
yourself
ill
by
crying
and
being
in
a
passion
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
do
it
all
,
"
said
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
However
,
we
'll
be
friends
now
.
<EOS>
And
you
want
me
:
you
would
wish
to
see
me
sometimes
,
really
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
I
did
,
"
he
replied
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
Sit
on
the
settle
and
let
me
lean
on
your
knee
.
<EOS>
That
's
as
mamma
used
to
do
,
whole
afternoons
together
.
<EOS>
Sit
quite
still
and
do
n't
talk
:
but
you
may
sing
a
song
,
if
you
can
sing
;
or
you
may
say
a
nice
long
interesting
ballad
 
one
of
those
you
promised
to
teach
me
;
or
a
story
.
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
have
a
ballad
,
though
:
begin
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
repeated
the
longest
she
could
remember
.
<EOS>
The
employment
pleased
both
mightily
.
<EOS>
Linton
would
have
another
,
and
after
that
another
,
notwithstanding
my
strenuous
objections
;
and
so
they
went
on
until
the
clock
struck
twelve
,
and
we
heard
Hareton
in
the
court
,
returning
for
his
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
to
-
morrow
,
Catherine
,
will
you
be
here
to
-
morrow
?
"
asked
young
Heathcliff
,
holding
her
frock
as
she
rose
reluctantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
I
answered
,
"
nor
next
day
neither
.
<EOS>
"
She
,
however
,
gave
a
different
response
evidently
,
for
his
forehead
cleared
as
she
stooped
and
whispered
in
his
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
go
to
-
morrow
,
recollect
,
Miss
!
<EOS>
"
I
commenced
,
when
we
were
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
dreaming
of
it
,
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
smiled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
'll
take
good
care
,
"
I
continued
:
"
I
'll
have
that
lock
mended
,
and
you
can
escape
by
no
way
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
get
over
the
wall
,
"
she
said
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Grange
is
not
a
prison
,
Ellen
,
and
you
are
not
my
gaoler
.
<EOS>
And
besides
,
I
'm
almost
seventeen
:
I
'm
a
woman
.
<EOS>
And
I
'm
certain
Linton
would
recover
quickly
if
he
had
me
to
look
after
him
.
<EOS>
I
'm
older
than
he
is
,
you
know
,
and
wiser
:
<EOS>
less
childish
,
am
I
not
?
<EOS>
And
he
'll
soon
do
as
I
direct
him
,
with
some
slight
coaxing
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
pretty
little
darling
when
he
's
good
.
<EOS>
I
'd
make
such
a
pet
of
him
,
if
he
were
mine
.
<EOS>
We
should
never
quarrel
,
should
we
after
we
were
used
to
each
other
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
like
him
,
Ellen
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Like
him
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
The
worst
-
tempered
bit
of
a
sickly
slip
that
ever
struggled
into
its
teens
.
<EOS>
Happily
,
as
Mr.
Heathcliff
conjectured
,
he
'll
not
win
twenty
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
he
'll
see
spring
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
And
small
loss
to
his
family
whenever
he
drops
off
.
<EOS>
And
lucky
it
is
for
us
that
his
father
took
him
:
the
kinder
he
was
treated
,
the
more
tedious
and
selfish
he
'd
be
.
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
you
have
no
chance
of
having
him
for
a
husband
,
Miss
Catherine
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
companion
waxed
serious
at
hearing
this
speech
.
<EOS>
To
speak
of
his
death
so
regardlessly
wounded
her
feelings
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
younger
than
I
,
"
she
answered
,
after
a
protracted
pause
of
meditation
,
"
and
he
ought
to
live
the
longest
:
he
will
 
he
must
live
as
long
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
He
's
as
strong
now
as
when
he
first
came
into
the
north
;
I
'm
positive
of
that
.
<EOS>
It
's
only
a
cold
that
ails
him
,
the
same
as
papa
has
.
<EOS>
You
say
papa
will
get
better
,
and
why
should
n't
he
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
I
cried
,
"
<EOS>
after
all
,
we
need
n't
trouble
ourselves
;
for
listen
,
Miss
,
 
and
mind
,
I
'll
keep
my
word
,
 
if
you
attempt
going
to
Wuthering
Heights
again
,
with
or
without
me
,
I
shall
inform
Mr.
Linton
,
and
,
unless
he
allow
it
,
the
intimacy
with
your
cousin
must
not
be
revived
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
revived
,
"
muttered
Cathy
,
sulkily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Must
not
be
continued
,
then
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
'll
see
,
"
was
her
reply
,
and
she
set
off
at
a
gallop
,
leaving
me
to
toil
in
the
rear
.
  
<EOS>
We
both
reached
home
before
our
dinner
-
time
;
my
master
supposed
we
had
been
wandering
through
the
park
,
and
therefore
he
demanded
no
explanation
of
our
absence
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
entered
I
hastened
to
change
my
soaked
shoes
and
stockings
;
but
sitting
such
awhile
at
the
Heights
had
done
the
mischief
.
<EOS>
On
the
succeeding
morning
I
was
laid
up
,
and
during
three
weeks
I
remained
incapacitated
for
attending
to
my
duties
:
a
calamity
never
experienced
prior
to
that
period
,
and
never
,
I
am
thankful
to
say
,
since
.
  
<EOS>
My
little
mistress
behaved
like
an
angel
in
coming
to
wait
on
me
,
and
cheer
my
solitude
;
the
confinement
brought
me
exceedingly
low
.
<EOS>
It
is
wearisome
,
to
a
stirring
active
body
:
but
few
have
slighter
reasons
for
complaint
than
I
had
.
<EOS>
The
moment
Catherine
left
Mr.
Linton
's
room
she
appeared
at
my
bedside
.
<EOS>
Her
day
was
divided
between
us
;
no
amusement
usurped
a
minute
:
she
neglected
her
meals
,
her
studies
,
and
her
play
;
and
she
was
the
fondest
nurse
that
ever
watched
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
had
a
warm
heart
,
when
she
loved
her
father
so
,
to
give
so
much
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
said
her
days
were
divided
between
us
;
but
the
master
retired
early
,
and
I
generally
needed
nothing
after
six
o'clock
,
<EOS>
thus
the
evening
was
her
own
.
<EOS>
Poor
thing
!
<EOS>
I
never
considered
what
she
did
with
herself
after
tea
.
<EOS>
And
though
frequently
,
when
she
looked
in
to
bid
me
good
-
night
,
I
remarked
a
fresh
colour
in
her
cheeks
and
a
pinkness
over
her
slender
fingers
,
instead
of
fancying
the
line
borrowed
from
a
cold
ride
across
the
moors
,
I
laid
it
to
the
charge
of
a
hot
fire
in
the
library
.
    
<EOS>
At
the
close
of
three
weeks
I
was
able
to
quit
my
chamber
and
move
about
the
house
.
<EOS>
And
on
the
first
occasion
of
my
sitting
up
in
the
evening
I
asked
Catherine
to
read
to
me
,
because
my
eyes
were
weak
.
<EOS>
We
were
in
the
library
,
the
master
having
gone
to
bed
:
she
consented
,
rather
unwillingly
,
I
fancied
;
and
imagining
my
sort
of
books
did
not
suit
her
,
I
bid
her
please
herself
in
the
choice
of
what
she
perused
.
<EOS>
She
selected
one
of
her
own
favourites
,
and
got
forward
steadily
about
an
hour
;
then
came
frequent
questions
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ellen
,
are
not
you
tired
?
<EOS>
Had
n't
you
better
lie
down
now
?
<EOS>
You
'll
be
sick
,
keeping
up
so
long
,
Ellen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
dear
,
I
'm
not
tired
,
"
I
returned
,
continually
.
  
<EOS>
Perceiving
me
immovable
,
she
essayed
another
method
of
showing
her
disrelish
for
her
occupation
.
<EOS>
It
changed
to
yawning
,
and
stretching
,
and
    
"
Ellen
,
I
'm
tired
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
over
then
and
talk
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
That
was
worse
:
she
fretted
and
sighed
,
and
looked
at
her
watch
till
eight
,
and
finally
went
to
her
room
,
completely
overdone
with
sleep
;
judging
by
her
peevish
,
heavy
look
,
and
the
constant
rubbing
she
inflicted
on
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
following
night
she
seemed
more
impatient
still
;
and
on
the
third
from
recovering
my
company
she
complained
of
a
headache
,
and
left
me
.
<EOS>
I
thought
her
conduct
odd
;
and
having
remained
alone
a
long
while
,
I
resolved
on
going
and
inquiring
whether
she
were
better
,
and
asking
her
to
come
and
lie
on
the
sofa
,
instead
of
up
-
stairs
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
No
Catherine
could
I
discover
up
-
stairs
,
and
none
below
.
<EOS>
The
servants
affirmed
they
had
not
seen
her
.
<EOS>
I
listened
at
Mr.
Edgar
's
door
;
all
was
silence
.
<EOS>
I
returned
to
her
apartment
,
extinguished
my
candle
,
and
seated
myself
in
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
The
moon
shone
bright
;
a
sprinkling
of
snow
covered
the
ground
,
and
I
reflected
that
she
might
,
possibly
,
have
taken
it
into
her
head
to
walk
about
the
garden
,
for
refreshment
.
<EOS>
I
did
detect
a
figure
creeping
along
the
inner
fence
of
the
park
;
but
it
was
not
my
young
mistress
:
on
its
emerging
into
the
light
,
I
recognised
one
of
the
grooms
.
<EOS>
He
stood
a
considerable
period
,
viewing
the
carriage
-
road
through
the
grounds
;
then
started
off
at
a
brisk
pace
,
as
if
he
had
detected
something
,
and
reappeared
presently
,
leading
Miss
's
pony
;
and
there
she
was
,
just
dismounted
,
and
walking
by
its
side
.
<EOS>
The
man
took
his
charge
stealthily
across
the
grass
towards
the
stable
.
<EOS>
Cathy
entered
by
the
casement
-
window
of
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
glided
noiselessly
up
to
where
I
awaited
her
.
<EOS>
She
put
the
door
gently
too
,
slipped
off
her
snowy
shoes
,
untied
her
hat
,
and
was
proceeding
,
unconscious
of
my
espionage
,
to
lay
aside
her
mantle
,
when
I
suddenly
rose
and
revealed
myself
.
<EOS>
The
surprise
petrified
her
an
instant
:
she
uttered
an
inarticulate
exclamation
,
and
stood
fixed
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Miss
Catherine
,
"
I
began
,
too
vividly
impressed
by
her
recent
kindness
to
break
into
a
scold
,
"
where
have
you
been
riding
out
at
this
hour
?
<EOS>
And
why
should
you
try
to
deceive
me
by
telling
a
tale
?
<EOS>
Where
have
you
been
?
<EOS>
Speak
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
the
bottom
of
the
park
,
"
she
stammered
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
tell
a
tale
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
nowhere
else
?
"
I
demanded
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
was
the
muttered
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Catherine
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
,
sorrowfully
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
you
have
been
doing
wrong
,
or
you
would
n't
be
driven
to
uttering
an
untruth
to
me
.
<EOS>
That
does
grieve
me
.
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
be
three
months
ill
,
than
hear
you
frame
a
deliberate
lie
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
sprang
forward
,
and
bursting
into
tears
,
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Ellen
,
I
'm
so
afraid
of
you
being
angry
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Promise
not
to
be
angry
,
and
you
shall
know
the
very
truth
:
I
hate
to
hide
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
sat
down
in
the
window
-
seat
;
I
assured
her
I
would
not
scold
,
whatever
her
secret
might
be
,
and
I
guessed
it
,
of
course
;
so
she
commenced
    
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
Ellen
,
and
I
've
never
missed
going
a
day
since
you
fell
ill
;
except
thrice
before
,
and
twice
after
you
left
your
room
.
<EOS>
I
gave
Michael
books
and
pictures
to
prepare
Minny
every
evening
,
and
to
put
her
back
in
the
stable
:
you
must
n't
scold
him
either
,
mind
.
<EOS>
I
was
at
the
Heights
by
half
-
past
six
,
and
generally
stayed
till
half
-
past
eight
,
and
then
galloped
home
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
to
amuse
myself
that
I
went
:
<EOS>
I
was
often
wretched
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
Now
<EOS>
and
then
I
was
happy
:
once
in
a
week
perhaps
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
I
expected
there
would
be
sad
work
persuading
you
to
let
me
keep
my
word
to
Linton
:
for
I
had
engaged
to
call
again
next
day
,
when
we
quitted
him
;
but
,
as
you
stayed
up
-
stairs
on
the
morrow
,
I
escaped
that
trouble
.
<EOS>
While
Michael
was
refastening
the
lock
of
the
park
door
in
the
afternoon
,
I
got
possession
of
the
key
,
and
told
him
how
my
cousin
wished
me
to
visit
him
,
because
he
was
sick
,
and
could
n't
come
to
the
Grange
;
and
how
papa
would
object
to
my
going
:
<EOS>
and
then
I
negotiated
with
him
about
the
pony
.
<EOS>
He
is
fond
of
reading
,
and
he
thinks
of
leaving
soon
to
get
married
;
so
he
offered
,
if
I
would
lend
him
books
out
of
the
library
,
to
do
what
I
wished
:
<EOS>
but
I
preferred
giving
him
my
own
,
and
that
satisfied
him
better
.
  
<EOS>
"
On
my
second
visit
Linton
seemed
in
lively
spirits
;
and
Zillah
(
that
is
their
housekeeper
)
made
us
a
clean
room
and
a
good
fire
,
and
told
us
that
,
as
Joseph
was
out
at
a
prayer
-
meeting
and
Hareton
Earnshaw
was
off
with
his
dogs
 
robbing
our
woods
of
pheasants
,
as
I
heard
afterwards
 
we
might
do
what
we
liked
.
<EOS>
She
brought
me
some
warm
wine
and
gingerbread
,
and
appeared
exceedingly
good
-
natured
,
and
Linton
sat
in
the
arm
-
chair
,
and
I
in
the
little
rocking
chair
on
the
hearth
-
stone
,
and
we
laughed
and
talked
so
merrily
,
and
found
so
much
to
say
:
we
planned
where
we
would
go
,
and
what
we
would
do
in
summer
.
<EOS>
I
need
n't
repeat
that
,
because
you
would
call
it
silly
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
time
,
however
,
we
were
near
quarrelling
.
<EOS>
He
said
the
pleasantest
manner
of
spending
a
hot
July
day
was
lying
from
morning
till
evening
on
a
bank
of
heath
in
the
middle
of
the
moors
,
with
the
bees
humming
dreamily
about
among
the
bloom
,
and
the
larks
singing
high
up
overhead
,
and
the
blue
sky
and
bright
sun
shining
steadily
and
cloudlessly
.
<EOS>
That
was
his
most
perfect
idea
of
heaven
's
happiness
:
mine
was
rocking
in
a
rustling
green
tree
,
with
a
west
wind
blowing
,
and
bright
white
clouds
flitting
rapidly
above
;
and
not
only
larks
,
but
throstles
,
and
blackbirds
,
and
linnets
,
and
cuckoos
pouring
out
music
on
every
side
,
and
the
moors
seen
at
a
distance
,
broken
into
cool
dusky
dells
;
but
close
by
great
swells
of
long
grass
undulating
in
waves
to
the
breeze
;
and
woods
and
sounding
water
,
and
the
whole
world
awake
and
wild
with
joy
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
all
to
lie
in
an
ecstasy
of
peace
;
I
wanted
all
to
sparkle
and
dance
in
a
glorious
jubilee
.
<EOS>
I
said
his
heaven
would
be
only
half
alive
;
and
he
said
mine
would
be
drunk
:
I
said
I
should
fall
asleep
in
his
;
and
he
said
he
could
not
breathe
in
mine
,
and
began
to
grow
very
snappish
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
we
agreed
to
try
both
,
as
soon
as
the
right
weather
came
;
and
then
we
kissed
each
other
and
were
friends
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
sitting
still
an
hour
,
I
looked
at
the
great
room
with
its
smooth
uncarpeted
floor
,
and
thought
how
nice
it
would
be
to
play
in
,
if
we
removed
the
table
;
and
I
asked
Linton
to
call
Zillah
in
to
help
us
,
and
we
'd
have
a
game
at
blindman's
-
buff
;
she
should
try
to
catch
us
:
<EOS>
you
used
to
,
you
know
,
Ellen
.
<EOS>
He
would
n't
:
there
was
no
pleasure
in
it
,
he
said
;
but
he
consented
to
play
at
ball
with
me
.
<EOS>
We
found
two
in
a
cupboard
,
among
a
heap
of
old
toys
,
tops
,
and
hoops
,
and
battledores
and
shuttlecocks
.
<EOS>
One
was
marked
C.
,
and
the
other
H.
;
I
wished
to
have
the
C.
,
because
that
stood
for
Catherine
,
and
the
H.
might
be
for
Heathcliff
,
his
name
;
but
the
bran
came
out
of
H.
,
and
Linton
did
n't
like
it
.
<EOS>
I
beat
him
constantly
:
and
he
got
cross
again
,
and
coughed
,
and
returned
to
his
chair
.
<EOS>
That
night
,
though
,
he
easily
recovered
his
good
humour
:
he
was
charmed
with
two
or
three
pretty
songs
 
_
your
_
songs
,
Ellen
;
and
when
I
was
obliged
to
go
,
he
begged
and
entreated
me
to
come
the
following
evening
;
and
I
promised
.
<EOS>
Minny
<EOS>
and
I
went
flying
home
as
light
as
air
;
<EOS>
and
I
dreamt
of
Wuthering
Heights
and
my
sweet
,
darling
cousin
,
till
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
morrow
I
was
sad
;
partly
because
you
were
poorly
,
and
partly
that
I
wished
my
father
knew
,
and
approved
of
my
excursions
:
but
it
was
beautiful
moonlight
after
tea
;
and
,
as
I
rode
on
,
the
gloom
cleared
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
another
happy
evening
,
I
thought
to
myself
;
and
what
delights
me
more
,
my
pretty
Linton
will
.
<EOS>
I
trotted
up
their
garden
,
and
was
turning
round
to
the
back
,
when
that
fellow
Earnshaw
met
me
,
took
my
bridle
,
and
bid
me
go
in
by
the
front
entrance
.
<EOS>
He
patted
Minny
's
neck
,
and
said
she
was
a
bonny
beast
,
and
appeared
as
if
he
wanted
me
to
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
only
told
him
to
leave
my
horse
alone
,
or
else
it
would
kick
him
.
<EOS>
He
answered
in
his
vulgar
accent
,
"
It
would
n't
do
mitch
hurt
if
it
did
;
"
and
surveyed
its
legs
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
I
was
half
inclined
to
make
it
try
;
however
,
he
moved
off
to
open
the
door
,
and
,
as
he
raised
the
latch
,
he
looked
up
to
the
inscription
above
,
and
said
,
with
a
stupid
mixture
of
awkwardness
and
elation
:
"
<EOS>
Miss
Catherine
!
<EOS>
I
can
read
yon
,
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Wonderful
,
"
I
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pray
let
us
hear
you
 
<EOS>
you
_
are
_
grown
clever
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
spelt
,
and
drawled
over
by
syllables
,
the
name
 
"
Hareton
Earnshaw
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
"
And
the
figures
?
<EOS>
"
I
cried
,
encouragingly
,
perceiving
that
he
came
to
a
dead
halt
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
can
not
tell
them
yet
,
"
he
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Oh
,
you
dunce
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
laughing
heartily
at
his
failure
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
fool
stared
,
with
a
grin
hovering
about
his
lips
,
and
a
scowl
gathering
over
his
eyes
,
as
if
uncertain
whether
he
might
not
join
in
my
mirth
:
whether
it
were
not
pleasant
familiarity
,
or
what
it
really
was
,
contempt
.
<EOS>
I
settled
his
doubts
,
by
suddenly
retrieving
my
gravity
and
desiring
him
to
walk
away
,
for
I
came
to
see
Linton
,
not
him
.
<EOS>
He
reddened
 
I
saw
that
by
the
moonlight
 
dropped
his
hand
from
the
latch
,
and
skulked
off
,
a
picture
of
mortified
vanity
.
<EOS>
He
imagined
himself
to
be
as
accomplished
as
Linton
,
I
suppose
,
because
he
could
spell
his
own
name
;
and
was
marvellously
discomfited
that
I
did
n't
think
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Stop
,
Miss
Catherine
,
dear
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
interrupted
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
scold
,
but
I
do
n't
like
your
conduct
there
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
remembered
that
Hareton
was
your
cousin
as
much
as
Master
Heathcliff
,
you
would
have
felt
how
improper
it
was
to
behave
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
At
least
,
it
was
praiseworthy
ambition
for
him
to
desire
to
be
as
accomplished
as
Linton
;
and
probably
he
did
not
learn
merely
to
show
off
:
you
had
made
him
ashamed
of
his
ignorance
before
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
;
and
he
wished
to
remedy
it
and
please
you
.
<EOS>
To
sneer
at
his
imperfect
attempt
was
very
bad
breeding
.
<EOS>
Had
you
been
brought
up
in
his
circumstances
,
would
you
be
less
rude
?
<EOS>
He
was
as
quick
and
as
intelligent
a
child
as
ever
you
were
;
and
I
'm
hurt
that
he
should
be
despised
now
,
because
that
base
Heathcliff
has
treated
him
so
unjustly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Ellen
,
you
wo
n't
cry
about
it
,
will
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
surprised
at
my
earnestness
.
"
<EOS>
But
wait
,
and
you
shall
hear
if
he
conned
his
A
B
C
to
please
me
;
and
if
it
were
worth
while
being
civil
to
the
brute
.
<EOS>
I
entered
;
Linton
was
lying
on
the
settle
,
and
half
got
up
to
welcome
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
'm
ill
to
-
night
,
Catherine
,
love
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
you
must
have
all
the
talk
,
and
let
me
listen
.
<EOS>
Come
,
and
sit
by
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
sure
you
would
n't
break
your
word
,
and
I
'll
make
you
promise
again
,
before
you
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
now
that
I
must
n't
tease
him
,
as
he
was
ill
;
and
I
spoke
softly
and
put
no
questions
,
and
avoided
irritating
him
in
any
way
.
<EOS>
I
had
brought
some
of
my
nicest
books
for
him
:
he
asked
me
to
read
a
little
of
one
,
and
I
was
about
to
comply
,
when
Earnshaw
burst
the
door
open
:
having
gathered
venom
with
reflection
.
<EOS>
He
advanced
direct
to
us
,
seized
Linton
by
the
arm
,
and
swung
him
off
the
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Get
to
thy
own
room
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
in
a
voice
almost
inarticulate
with
passion
;
and
his
face
looked
swelled
and
furious
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Take
her
there
if
she
comes
to
see
thee
:
<EOS>
thou
shalln't
keep
me
out
of
this
.
<EOS>
Begone
wi
'
ye
both
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
swore
at
us
,
and
left
Linton
no
time
to
answer
,
nearly
throwing
him
into
the
kitchen
;
and
he
clenched
his
fist
as
I
followed
,
seemingly
longing
to
knock
me
down
.
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
for
a
moment
,
and
I
let
one
volume
fall
;
he
kicked
it
after
me
,
and
shut
us
out
.
<EOS>
I
heard
a
malignant
,
crackly
laugh
by
the
fire
,
and
turning
,
beheld
that
odious
Joseph
standing
rubbing
his
bony
hands
,
and
quivering
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I

"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Where
must
we
go
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
of
my
cousin
,
disregarding
the
old
wretch
's
mockery
.
  
<EOS>
"
Linton
was
white
and
trembling
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
pretty
then
,
Ellen
:
<EOS>
oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
he
looked
frightful
;
for
his
thin
face
and
large
eyes
were
wrought
into
an
expression
of
frantic
,
powerless
fury
.
<EOS>
He
grasped
the
handle
of
the
door
,
and
shook
it
:
it
was
fastened
inside
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
If
you
do
n't
let
me
in
,
I
'll
kill
you
!
 
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
let
me
in
,
I
'll
kill
you
!
"
<EOS>
he
rather
shrieked
than
said
.
<EOS>
"
Devil
!
<EOS>
devil
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
kill
you
 
I
'll
kill
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Joseph
uttered
his
croaking
laugh
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Thear
,
that
's
t
'
father
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
father

<EOS>
We
've
allas

<EOS>

"
feard
 
<EOS>
he

not

at
thee
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
took
hold
of
Linton
's
hands
,
and
tried
to
pull
him
away
;
but
he
shrieked
so
shockingly
that
I
dared
not
proceed
.
<EOS>
At
last
his
cries
were
choked
by
a
dreadful
fit
of
coughing
;
blood
gushed
from
his
mouth
,
and
he
fell
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
I
ran
into
the
yard
,
sick
with
terror
;
and
called
for
Zillah
,
as
loud
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
She
soon
heard
me
:
she
was
milking
the
cows
in
a
shed
behind
the
barn
,
and
hurrying
from
her
work
,
she
inquired
what
there
was
to
do
?
<EOS>
I
had
n't
breath
to
explain
;
dragging
her
in
,
I
looked
about
for
Linton
.
<EOS>
Earnshaw
had
come
out
to
examine
the
mischief
he
had
caused
,
and
he
was
then
conveying
the
poor
thing
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
Zillah
and
I
ascended
after
him
;
but
he
stopped
me
at
the
top
of
the
steps
,
and
said
I
should
n't
go
in
:
I
must
go
home
.
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
that
he
had
killed
Linton
,
and
I
_
would
_
enter
.
<EOS>
Joseph
locked
the
door
,
and
declared
I
should
do
"
no
sich
stuff
,
"
and
asked
me
whether
I
were
"
bahn
to
be
as
mad
as
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
stood
crying
till
the
housekeeper
reappeared
.
<EOS>
She
affirmed
he
would
be
better
in
a
bit
,
but
he
could
n't
do
with
that
shrieking
and
din
;
and
she
took
me
,
and
nearly
carried
me
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ellen
,
I
was
ready
to
tear
my
hair
off
my
head
!
<EOS>
I
sobbed
and
wept
so
that
my
eyes
were
almost
blind
;
and
the
ruffian
you
have
such
sympathy
with
stood
opposite
:
presuming
every
now
and
then
to
bid
me
"
wisht
,
"
and
denying
that
it
was
his
fault
;
and
,
finally
,
frightened
by
my
assertions
that
I
would
tell
papa
,
and
that
he
should
be
put
in
prison
and
hanged
,
he
commenced
blubbering
himself
,
and
hurried
out
to
hide
his
cowardly
agitation
.
<EOS>
Still
,
I
was
not
rid
of
him
:
when
at
length
they
compelled
me
to
depart
,
and
I
had
got
some
hundred
yards
off
the
premises
,
he
suddenly
issued
from
the
shadow
of
the
road
-
side
,
and
checked
Minny
and
took
hold
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Miss
Catherine
<EOS>
,
I
'm
ill
grieved
,
"
he
began
,
"
but
it
's
rayther
too
bad
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
gave
him
a
cut
with
my
whip
,
thinking
perhaps
he
would
murder
me
.
<EOS>
He
let
go
,
thundering
one
of
his
horrid
curses
,
and
I
galloped
home
more
than
half
out
of
my
senses
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
bid
you
good
-
night
that
evening
,
and
I
did
n't
go
to
Wuthering
Heights
the
next
:
<EOS>
I
wished
to
go
exceedingly
;
but
I
was
strangely
excited
,
and
dreaded
to
hear
that
Linton
was
dead
,
sometimes
;
and
sometimes
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
encountering
Hareton
.
<EOS>
On
the
third
day
I
took
courage
:
at
least
,
I
could
n't
bear
longer
suspense
,
and
stole
off
once
more
.
<EOS>
I
went
at
five
o'clock
,
and
walked
;
fancying
I
might
manage
to
creep
into
the
house
,
and
up
to
Linton
's
room
,
unobserved
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
dogs
gave
notice
of
my
approach
.
<EOS>
Zillah
received
me
,
and
saying
"
the
lad
was
mending
nicely
,
"
showed
me
into
a
small
,
tidy
,
carpeted
apartment
,
where
,
to
my
inexpressible
joy
,
I
beheld
Linton
laid
on
a
little
sofa
,
reading
one
of
my
books
.
<EOS>
But
he
would
neither
speak
to
me
nor
look
at
me
,
through
a
whole
hour
,
Ellen
<EOS>
:
he
has
such
an
unhappy
temper
.
<EOS>
And
what
quite
confounded
me
,
when
he
did
open
his
mouth
,
it
was
to
utter
the
falsehood
that
I
had
occasioned
the
uproar
,
and
Hareton
was
not
to
blame
!
<EOS>
Unable
to
reply
,
except
passionately
,
I
got
up
and
walked
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
sent
after
me
a
faint
"
Catherine
!
"
<EOS>
He
did
not
reckon
on
being
answered
so
:
but
I
would
n't
turn
back
;
and
the
morrow
was
the
second
day
on
which
I
stayed
at
home
,
nearly
determined
to
visit
him
no
more
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
so
miserable
going
to
bed
and
getting
up
,
and
never
hearing
anything
about
him
,
that
my
resolution
melted
into
air
before
it
was
properly
formed
.
<EOS>
It
had
appeared
wrong
to
take
the
journey
once
;
now
it
seemed
wrong
to
refrain
.
<EOS>
Michael
came
to
ask
if
he
must
saddle
Minny
;
I
said
"
Yes
,
"
and
considered
myself
doing
a
duty
as
she
bore
me
over
the
hills
.
<EOS>
I
was
forced
to
pass
the
front
windows
to
get
to
the
court
:
it
was
no
use
trying
to
conceal
my
presence
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Young
master
is
in
the
house
,
"
said
Zillah
,
as
she
saw
me
making
for
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
I
went
in
;
Earnshaw
was
there
also
,
but
he
quitted
the
room
directly
.
<EOS>
Linton
sat
in
the
great
arm
-
chair
half
asleep
;
walking
up
to
the
fire
,
I
began
in
a
serious
tone
,
partly
meaning
it
to
be
true
    
"
<EOS>
"
As
you
do
n't
like
me
,
Linton
,
and
as
you
think
I
come
on
purpose
to
hurt
you
,
and
pretend
that
I
do
so
<EOS>
every
time
,
this
is
our
last
meeting
:
let
us
say
good
-
bye
;
and
tell
Mr.
Heathcliff
that
you
have
no
wish
to
see
me
,
and
that
he
must
n't
invent
any
more
falsehoods
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Sit
down
and
take
your
hat
off
,
Catherine
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
so
much
happier
than
I
am
,
you
ought
to
be
better
.
<EOS>
Papa
talks
enough
of
my
defects
,
and
shows
enough
scorn
of
me
,
to
make
it
natural
I
should
doubt
myself
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
I
am
not
altogether
as
worthless
as
he
calls
me
,
frequently
;
and
then
I
feel
so
cross
and
bitter
,
I
hate
everybody
!
<EOS>
I
am
worthless
,
and
bad
in
temper
,
and
bad
in
spirit
,
almost
always
;
and
,
if
you
choose
,
you
may
say
<EOS>
good
-
bye
<EOS>
:
you
'll
get
rid
of
an
annoyance
.
<EOS>
Only
,
Catherine
,
do
me
this
justice
:
believe
that
if
I
might
be
as
sweet
,
and
as
kind
,
and
as
good
as
you
are
,
I
would
be
;
as
willingly
,
and
more
so
,
than
as
happy
and
as
healthy
.
<EOS>
And
believe
that
your
kindness
has
made
me
love
you
deeper
than
if
I
deserved
your
love
:
and
though
I
could
n't
,
and
can
not
help
showing
my
nature
to
you
,
I
regret
it
and
repent
it
;
and
shall
regret
and
repent
it
till
I
die
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
felt
he
spoke
the
truth
;
and
I
felt
I
must
forgive
him
:
and
,
though
we
should
quarrel
the
next
moment
,
I
must
forgive
him
again
.
<EOS>
We
were
reconciled
;
but
we
cried
,
both
of
us
,
the
whole
time
I
stayed
:
not
entirely
for
sorrow
;
yet
I
_
was
_
<EOS>
sorry
Linton
had
that
distorted
nature
.
<EOS>
He
'll
never
let
his
friends
be
at
ease
,
and
he
'll
never
be
at
ease
himself
!
<EOS>
I
have
always
gone
to
his
little
parlour
,
since
that
night
;
because
his
father
returned
the
day
after
.
  
<EOS>
"
About
three
times
,
I
think
,
we
have
been
merry
and
hopeful
,
as
we
were
the
first
evening
;
the
rest
of
my
visits
were
dreary
and
troubled
:
now
with
his
selfishness
and
spite
,
and
now
with
his
sufferings
:
but
I
've
learned
to
endure
the
former
with
nearly
as
little
resentment
as
the
latter
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
purposely
avoids
me
:
<EOS>
I
have
hardly
seen
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
Last
Sunday
,
indeed
,
coming
earlier
than
usual
,
I
heard
him
abusing
poor
Linton
cruelly
for
his
conduct
of
the
night
before
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
tell
how
he
knew
of
it
,
unless
he
listened
.
<EOS>
Linton
had
certainly
behaved
provokingly
:
however
,
it
was
the
business
of
nobody
but
me
,
and
I
interrupted
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
lecture
by
entering
and
telling
him
so
.
<EOS>
He
burst
into
a
laugh
,
and
went
away
,
saying
he
was
glad
I
took
that
view
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Since
then
,
I
've
told
Linton
he
must
whisper
his
bitter
things
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Ellen
,
you
have
heard
all
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
be
prevented
from
going
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
except
by
inflicting
misery
on
two
people
;
whereas
,
if
you
'll
only
not
tell
papa
,
my
going
need
disturb
the
tranquillity
of
none
.
<EOS>
You
'll
not
tell
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
It
will
be
very
heartless
,
if
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
make
up
my
mind
on
that
point
by
to
-
morrow
,
Miss
Catherine
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
It
requires
some
study
;
and
so
I
'll
leave
you
to
your
rest
,
and
go
think
it
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
it
over
aloud
,
in
my
master
's
presence
;
walking
straight
from
her
room
to
his
,
and
relating
the
whole
story
:
with
the
exception
of
her
conversations
with
her
cousin
,
and
any
mention
of
Hareton
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
was
alarmed
and
distressed
,
more
than
he
would
acknowledge
to
me
.
<EOS>
In
the
morning
,
Catherine
learnt
my
betrayal
of
her
confidence
,
and
she
learnt
also
that
her
secret
visits
were
to
end
.
<EOS>
In
vain
she
wept
and
writhed
against
the
interdict
,
and
implored
her
father
to
have
pity
on
Linton
:
all
she
got
to
comfort
her
was
a
promise
that
he
would
write
and
give
him
leave
to
come
to
the
Grange
when
he
pleased
;
but
explaining
that
he
must
no
longer
expect
to
see
Catherine
at
Wuthering
Heights
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
had
he
been
aware
of
his
nephew
's
disposition
and
state
of
health
,
he
would
have
seen
fit
to
withhold
even
that
slight
consolation
.
    
<EOS>
"
These
things
happened
last
winter
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs.
Dean
;
"
hardly
more
than
a
year
ago
.
<EOS>
Last
winter
,
I
did
not
think
,
at
another
twelve
months
'
end
,
I
should
be
amusing
a
stranger
to
the
family
with
relating
them
!
<EOS>
Yet
,
who
knows
how
long
you
'll
be
a
stranger
?
<EOS>
You
're
too
young
to
rest
always
contented
,
living
by
yourself
;
and
I
some
way
fancy
no
one
could
see
Catherine
Linton
and
not
love
her
.
<EOS>
You
smile
;
but
why
do
you
look
so
lively
and
interested
when
I
talk
about
her
?
<EOS>
and
why
have
you
asked
me
to
hang
her
picture
over
your
fireplace
?
<EOS>
and
why
 
?
"
  
"
Stop
,
my
good
friend
!
"
I
cried
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
very
possible
that
_
I
_
should
love
her
;
but
would
she
love
me
?
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
too
much
to
venture
my
tranquillity
by
running
into
temptation
:
and
then
my
home
is
not
here
.
<EOS>
I
'm
of
the
busy
world
,
and
to
its
arms
I
must
return
.
<EOS>
Go
on
.
<EOS>
Was
Catherine
obedient
to
her
father
's
commands
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
,
"
continued
the
housekeeper
.
"
<EOS>
Her
affection
for
him
was
still
the
chief
sentiment
in
her
heart
;
and
he
spoke
without
anger
:
he
spoke
in
the
deep
tenderness
of
one
about
to
leave
his
treasure
amid
perils
and
foes
,
where
his
remembered
words
would
be
the
only
aid
that
he
could
bequeath
to
guide
her
.
<EOS>
He
said
to
me
,
a
few
days
afterwards
,
"
I
wish
my
nephew
would
write
,
Ellen
,
or
call
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
sincerely
,
what
you
think
of
him
:
is
he
changed
for
the
better
,
or
is
there
a
prospect
of
improvement
,
as
he
grows
a
man
?
"
  
"
"
He
's
very
delicate
,
sir
,
"
I
replied
;
"
and
scarcely
likely
to
reach
manhood
:
but
this
I
can
say
,
he
does
not
resemble
his
father
;
and
if
Miss
Catherine
had
the
misfortune
to
marry
him
,
he
would
not
be
beyond
her
control
:
unless
she
were
extremely
and
foolishly
indulgent
.
<EOS>
However
,
master
,
you
'll
have
plenty
of
time
to
get
acquainted
with
him
and
see
whether
he
would
suit
her
:
it
wants
four
years
and
more
to
his
being
of
age
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Edgar
sighed
;
and
,
walking
to
the
window
,
looked
out
towards
Gimmerton
Kirk
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
misty
afternoon
,
but
the
February
sun
shone
dimly
,
and
we
could
just
distinguish
the
two
fir
-
trees
in
the
yard
,
and
the
sparely
-
scattered
gravestones
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
prayed
often
,
"
he
half
soliloquised
,
"
for
the
approach
of
what
is
coming
;
and
now
I
begin
to
shrink
,
and
fear
it
.
<EOS>
I
thought
the
memory
of
the
hour
<EOS>
I
came
down
that
glen
<EOS>
a
bridegroom
would
be
less
sweet
than
the
anticipation
that
I
was
soon
,
in
a
few
months
,
or
,
possibly
,
weeks
,
to
be
carried
up
,
and
laid
in
its
lonely
hollow
!
<EOS>
Ellen
,
I
've
been
very
happy
with
my
little
Cathy
:
through
winter
nights
and
summer
days
she
was
a
living
hope
at
my
side
.
<EOS>
But
I
've
been
as
happy
musing
by
myself
among
those
stones
,
under
that
old
church
:
lying
,
through
the
long
June
evenings
,
on
the
green
mound
of
her
mother
's
grave
,
and
wishing
 
yearning
for
the
time
when
I
might
lie
beneath
it
.
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
for
Cathy
?
<EOS>
How
must
I
quit
her
?
<EOS>
I
'd
not
care
one
moment
for
Linton
being
Heathcliff
's
son
;
nor
for
his
taking
her
from
me
,
if
he
could
console
her
for
my
loss
.
<EOS>
I
'd
not
care
that
Heathcliff
gained
his
ends
,
and
triumphed
in
robbing
me
of
my
last
blessing
!
<EOS>
But
should
Linton
be
unworthy
 
only
a
feeble
tool
to
his
father
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
abandon
her
to
him
!
<EOS>
And
,
hard
though
it
be
to
crush
her
buoyant
spirit
,
I
must
persevere
in
making
her
sad
while
I
live
,
and
leaving
her
solitary
when
I
die
.
<EOS>
Darling
!
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
resign
her
to
God
,
and
lay
her
in
the
earth
before
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Resign
her
to
God
as
it
is
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
I
answered
,
"
and
<EOS>
if
we
should
lose
you
 
which
may
He
forbid
 
under
His
providence
<EOS>
,
I
'll
stand
her
friend
and
counsellor
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
Miss
Catherine
is
a
good
girl
:
I
do
n't
fear
that
she
will
go
wilfully
wrong
;
and
people
who
do
their
duty
are
always
finally
rewarded
.
"
  
<EOS>
Spring
advanced
;
yet
my
master
gathered
no
real
strength
,
though
he
resumed
his
walks
in
the
grounds
with
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
To
her
inexperienced
notions
,
this
itself
was
a
sign
of
convalescence
;
and
then
his
cheek
was
often
flushed
,
and
his
eyes
were
bright
;
she
felt
sure
of
his
recovering
.
<EOS>
On
her
seventeenth
birthday
,
he
did
not
visit
the
churchyard
:
it
was
raining
,
and
I
observed
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
surely
not
go
out
to
-
night
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
answered
,
 
"
No
,
I
'll
defer
it
this
year
a
little
longer
.
"
<EOS>
He
wrote
again
to
Linton
,
expressing
his
great
desire
to
see
him
;
and
,
had
the
invalid
been
presentable
,
<EOS>
I
've
no
doubt
his
father
would
have
permitted
him
to
come
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
being
instructed
,
he
returned
an
answer
,
intimating
that
Mr.
Heathcliff
objected
to
his
calling
at
the
Grange
;
but
his
uncle
's
kind
remembrance
delighted
him
,
and
he
hoped
to
meet
him
sometimes
in
his
rambles
,
and
personally
to
petition
that
his
cousin
and
he
might
not
remain
long
so
utterly
divided
.
  
<EOS>
That
part
of
his
letter
was
simple
,
and
probably
his
own
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
knew
he
could
plead
eloquently
for
Catherine
's
company
,
then
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
ask
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
she
may
visit
here
;
but
am
I
never
to
see
her
,
because
my
father
forbids
me
to
go
to
her
home
,
and
you
forbid
her
to
come
to
mine
?
<EOS>
Do
,
now
and
then
,
ride
with
her
towards
the
Heights
;
and
let
us
exchange
a
few
words
,
in
your
presence
!
<EOS>
We
have
done
nothing
to
deserve
this
separation
;
and
you
are
not
angry
with
me
:
you
have
no
reason
to
dislike
me
,
you
allow
,
yourself
.
<EOS>
Dear
uncle
!
<EOS>
send
me
a
kind
note
to
-
morrow
,
and
leave
to
join
you
anywhere
you
please
,
except
at
Thrushcross
Grange
.
<EOS>
I
believe
an
interview
would
convince
you
that
my
father
's
character
is
not
mine
:
he
affirms
I
am
more
your
nephew
than
his
son
;
and
though
I
have
faults
which
render
me
unworthy
of
Catherine
,
she
has
excused
them
,
and
for
her
sake
,
you
should
also
.
<EOS>
You
inquire
after
my
health
 
<EOS>
it
is
better
;
but
while
I
remain
cut
off
from
all
hope
,
and
doomed
to
solitude
,
or
the
society
of
those
who
never
did
and
never
will
like
me
,
how
can
I
be
cheerful
and
well
?
"
  
<EOS>
Edgar
,
though
he
felt
for
the
boy
,
could
not
consent
to
grant
his
request
;
because
he
could
not
accompany
Catherine
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
in
summer
,
perhaps
,
they
might
meet
:
meantime
,
he
wished
him
to
continue
writing
at
intervals
,
and
engaged
to
give
him
what
advice
and
comfort
<EOS>
he
was
able
by
letter
;
being
well
aware
of
his
hard
position
in
his
family
.
<EOS>
Linton
complied
;
and
had
he
been
unrestrained
,
would
probably
have
spoiled
all
by
filling
his
epistles
with
complaints
and
lamentations
:
but
his
father
kept
a
sharp
watch
over
him
;
and
,
of
course
,
insisted
on
every
line
that
my
master
sent
being
shown
;
so
,
instead
of
penning
his
peculiar
personal
sufferings
and
distresses
,
the
themes
constantly
uppermost
in
his
thoughts
,
he
harped
on
the
cruel
obligation
of
being
held
asunder
from
his
friend
and
love
;
and
gently
intimated
that
Mr.
Linton
must
allow
an
interview
soon
,
or
he
should
fear
he
was
purposely
deceiving
him
with
empty
promises
.
  
<EOS>
Cathy
was
a
powerful
ally
at
home
;
and
between
them
they
at
length
persuaded
my
master
to
acquiesce
in
their
having
a
ride
or
a
walk
together
about
once
a
week
,
under
my
guardianship
,
and
on
the
moors
nearest
the
Grange
:
for
June
found
him
still
declining
.
<EOS>
Though
he
had
set
aside
yearly
a
portion
of
his
income
for
my
young
lady
's
fortune
,
he
had
a
natural
desire
that
she
might
retain
 
or
at
least
return
in
a
short
time
to
 
the
house
of
her
ancestors
;
and
he
considered
her
only
prospect
of
doing
that
was
by
a
union
with
his
heir
;
he
had
no
idea
that
the
latter
was
failing
almost
as
fast
as
himself
;
nor
had
any
one
,
I
believe
:
no
doctor
visited
the
Heights
,
and
no
one
saw
Master
Heathcliff
to
make
report
of
his
condition
among
us
.
<EOS>
I
,
for
my
part
,
began
to
fancy
my
forebodings
were
false
,
and
that
he
must
be
actually
rallying
,
when
he
mentioned
riding
and
walking
on
the
moors
,
and
seemed
so
earnest
in
pursuing
his
object
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
picture
a
father
treating
a
dying
child
as
tyrannically
and
wickedly
as
I
afterwards
learned
Heathcliff
had
treated
him
,
to
compel
this
apparent
eagerness
:
his
efforts
redoubling
the
more
imminently
his
avaricious
and
unfeeling
plans
were
threatened
with
defeat
by
death
.
    
<EOS>
Summer
was
already
past
its
prime
,
when
Edgar
reluctantly
yielded
his
assent
to
their
entreaties
,
and
Catherine
and
I
set
out
on
our
first
ride
to
join
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
close
,
sultry
day
:
devoid
of
sunshine
,
but
with
a
sky
too
dappled
and
hazy
to
threaten
rain
:
and
our
place
of
meeting
had
been
fixed
at
the
guide
-
stone
,
by
the
cross
-
roads
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
there
,
however
,
a
little
herd
-
boy
,
despatched
as
a
messenger
,
told
us
that
,
 
"
Maister
Linton
wer
just
o
<EOS>
'
this
side
th
'
 
Heights
:
and
he
'd
be
mitch
obleeged
to
us
to
gang
on
a
bit
further
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
Master
Linton
has
forgot
the
first
injunction
of
his
uncle
,
"
<EOS>
I
observed
:
"
he
bid
us
keep
on
the
Grange
land
,
and
here
we
are
off
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
we
'll
turn
our
horses
'
heads
round
when
we
reach
him
,
"
answered
my
companion
;
"
our
excursion
shall
lie
towards
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
when
we
reached
him
,
and
that
was
scarcely
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
his
own
door
,
we
found
he
had
no
horse
;
and
we
were
forced
to
dismount
,
and
leave
ours
to
graze
.
<EOS>
He
lay
on
the
heath
,
awaiting
our
approach
,
and
did
not
rise
till
we
came
within
a
few
yards
.
<EOS>
Then
he
walked
so
feebly
,
and
looked
so
pale
,
that
I
immediately
exclaimed
,
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Master
Heathcliff
,
you
are
not
fit
for
enjoying
a
ramble
this
morning
.
<EOS>
How
ill
you
do
look
!
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
surveyed
him
with
grief
and
astonishment
:
she
changed
the
ejaculation
of
joy
on
her
lips
to
one
of
alarm
;
and
the
congratulation
on
their
long
-
postponed
meeting
to
an
anxious
inquiry
,
whether
he
were
worse
than
usual
?
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
 
better
 
better
!
"
<EOS>
he
panted
,
trembling
,
and
retaining
her
hand
as
if
he
needed
its
support
,
while
his
large
blue
eyes
wandered
timidly
over
her
;
the
hollowness
round
them
transforming
to
haggard
wildness
the
languid
expression
they
once
possessed
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
been
worse
,
"
persisted
his
cousin
;
"
worse
than
when
I
saw
you
last
;
you
are
thinner
,
and
 
"
  
"
I
'm
tired
,
"
he
interrupted
,
hurriedly
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
hot
for
walking
,
let
us
rest
here
.
<EOS>
And
,
in
the
morning
,
I
often
feel
sick
 
<EOS>
papa
says
I
grow
so
fast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Badly
satisfied
,
Cathy
sat
down
,
and
he
reclined
beside
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
something
like
your
paradise
,
"
said
she
,
making
an
effort
at
cheerfulness
.
<EOS>
"
You
recollect
the
two
days
we
agreed
to
spend
in
the
place
and
way
each
thought
pleasantest
?
<EOS>
This
is
nearly
yours
,
only
there
are
clouds
;
but
then
they
are
so
soft
and
mellow
:
it
is
nicer
than
sunshine
.
<EOS>
Next
week
,
if
you
can
,
we
'll
ride
down
to
the
Grange
Park
,
and
try
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
Linton
did
not
appear
to
remember
what
she
talked
of
<EOS>
and
he
had
evidently
great
difficulty
in
sustaining
any
kind
of
conversation
.
<EOS>
His
lack
of
interest
in
the
subjects
she
started
,
and
his
equal
incapacity
to
contribute
to
her
entertainment
,
were
so
obvious
that
she
could
not
conceal
her
disappointment
.
<EOS>
An
indefinite
alteration
had
come
over
his
whole
person
and
manner
.
<EOS>
The
pettishness
that
might
be
caressed
into
fondness
,
had
yielded
to
a
listless
apathy
;
there
was
less
of
the
peevish
temper
of
a
child
which
frets
and
teases
on
purpose
to
be
soothed
,
and
more
of
the
self
-
absorbed
moroseness
of
a
confirmed
invalid
,
repelling
consolation
,
and
ready
to
regard
the
good
-
humoured
mirth
of
others
as
an
insult
.
<EOS>
Catherine
perceived
,
as
well
as
I
did
,
that
he
held
it
rather
a
punishment
,
than
a
gratification
,
to
endure
our
company
;
and
she
made
no
scruple
of
proposing
,
presently
,
to
depart
.
<EOS>
That
proposal
,
unexpectedly
,
roused
Linton
from
his
lethargy
,
and
threw
him
into
a
strange
state
of
agitation
.
<EOS>
He
glanced
fearfully
towards
the
Heights
,
begging
she
would
remain
another
half
-
hour
,
at
least
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
think
,
"
said
Cathy
,
"
you
'd
be
more
comfortable
at
home
than
sitting
here
;
and
I
can
not
amuse
you
to
-
day
<EOS>
,
I
see
,
by
my
tales
,
and
songs
,
and
chatter
:
you
have
grown
wiser
than
I
,
in
these
six
months
;
you
have
little
taste
for
my
diversions
now
:
or
else
,
if
I
could
amuse
you
,
I
'd
willingly
stay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
to
rest
yourself
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
,
Catherine
,
do
n't
think
or
say
that
I
'm
_
<EOS>
very
_
<EOS>
unwell
<EOS>
:
it
is
the
heavy
weather
and
heat
that
make
me
dull
;
and
I
walked
about
,
before
you
came
,
a
great
deal
for
me
.
<EOS>
Tell
uncle
<EOS>
I
'm
in
tolerable
health
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
him
that
_
you
_
say
so
,
Linton
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
affirm
that
you
are
,
"
observed
my
young
lady
,
wondering
at
his
pertinacious
assertion
of
what
was
evidently
an
untruth
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
be
here
again
next
Thursday
,
"
continued
he
,
shunning
her
puzzled
gaze
.
"
<EOS>
And
give
him
my
thanks
for
permitting
you
to
come
 
my
best
thanks
,
Catherine
.
<EOS>
And
 
and
,
if
you
_
did
_
meet
my
father
,
and
he
asked
you
about
me
,
do
n't
lead
him
to
suppose
that
I
've
been
extremely
silent
and
stupid
:
do
n't
look
sad
and
downcast
,
as
you
are
doing
 
he
'll
be
angry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
care
nothing
for
his
anger
,
"
exclaimed
Cathy
,
imagining
she
would
be
its
object
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
,
"
said
her
cousin
,
shuddering
.
"
<EOS>
_
Do
n't
_
provoke
him
against
me
,
Catherine
,
for
he
is
very
hard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
severe
to
you
,
Master
Heathcliff
?
"
<EOS>
I
inquired
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Has
he
grown
weary
of
indulgence
,
and
passed
from
passive
to
active
hatred
?
"
  
<EOS>
Linton
looked
at
me
,
but
did
not
answer
;
and
,
after
keeping
her
seat
by
his
side
another
ten
minutes
,
during
which
his
head
fell
drowsily
on
his
breast
,
and
he
uttered
nothing
except
suppressed
moans
of
exhaustion
or
pain
,
Cathy
began
to
seek
solace
in
looking
for
bilberries
,
and
sharing
the
produce
of
her
researches
with
me
:
she
did
not
offer
them
to
him
,
for
she
saw
further
notice
would
only
weary
and
annoy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
half
-
an
-
hour
now
,
Ellen
?
"
<EOS>
she
whispered
in
my
ear
,
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
tell
why
we
should
stay
.
<EOS>
He
's
asleep
,
and
papa
will
be
wanting
us
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
we
must
not
leave
him
asleep
,
"
I
answered
;
"
wait
till
he
wakes
,
and
be
patient
.
<EOS>
You
were
mighty
eager
to
set
off
,
but
your
longing
to
see
poor
Linton
has
soon
evaporated
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
_
he
_
wish
to
see
me
?
"
returned
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
his
crossest
humours
,
formerly
,
I
liked
him
better
than
I
do
in
his
present
curious
mood
.
<EOS>
It
's
just
as
if
it
were
a
task
he
was
compelled
to
perform
 
this
interview
 
for
fear
his
father
should
scold
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
hardly
going
to
come
to
give
Mr.
Heathcliff
pleasure
;
whatever
reason
he
may
have
for
ordering
Linton
to
undergo
this
penance
.
<EOS>
And
,
though
I
'm
glad
he
's
better
in
health
,
I
'm
sorry
he
's
so
much
less
pleasant
,
and
so
much
less
affectionate
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
_
<EOS>
he
is
_
better
in
health
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
answered
;
"
because
he
always
made
such
a
great
deal
of
his
sufferings
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
tolerably
well
,
as
he
told
me
to
tell
papa
;
but
he
's
better
,
very
likely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
you
differ
with
me
,
Miss
Cathy
,
"
I
remarked
;
"
I
should
conjecture
him
to
be
far
worse
.
"
  
<EOS>
Linton
here
started
from
his
slumber
in
bewildered
terror
,
and
asked
if
any
one
had
called
his
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Catherine
;
"
unless
in
dreams
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
conceive
how
you
manage
to
doze
out
of
doors
,
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
heard
my
father
,
"
he
gasped
,
glancing
up
to
the
frowning
nab
above
us
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
sure
nobody
spoke
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
sure
,
"
replied
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
Ellen
and
I
were
disputing
concerning
your
health
.
<EOS>
Are
you
truly
stronger
,
Linton
,
than
when
we
separated
in
winter
?
<EOS>
If
you
be
,
I
'm
certain
one
thing
is
not
stronger
 
<EOS>
your
regard
for
me
<EOS>
:
speak
,
 
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
tears
gushed
from
Linton
's
eyes
as
he
answered
,
"
Yes
,
yes
,
I
am
!
"
<EOS>
And
,
still
under
the
spell
of
the
imaginary
voice
,
his
gaze
wandered
up
and
down
to
detect
its
owner
.
  
<EOS>
Cathy
rose
.
<EOS>
"
For
to
-
day
we
must
part
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
wo
n't
conceal
that
I
have
been
sadly
disappointed
with
our
meeting
;
though
I
'll
mention
it
to
nobody
<EOS>
but
you
:
<EOS>
not
that
I
stand
in
awe
of
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hush
,
"
murmured
Linton
;
"
for
God
's
sake
,
hush
!
<EOS>
He
's
coming
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
clung
to
Catherine
's
arm
,
striving
to
detain
her
;
but
at
that
announcement
she
hastily
disengaged
herself
,
and
whistled
to
Minny
,
who
obeyed
her
like
a
dog
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
here
next
Thursday
,
"
she
cried
,
springing
to
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
Quick
,
Ellen
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
we
left
him
,
scarcely
conscious
of
our
departure
,
<EOS>
so
absorbed
was
he
in
anticipating
his
father
's
approach
.
  
<EOS>
Before
we
reached
home
,
Catherine
's
displeasure
softened
into
a
perplexed
sensation
of
pity
and
regret
,
largely
blended
with
vague
,
uneasy
doubts
about
Linton
's
actual
circumstances
,
physical
and
social
:
in
which
I
partook
,
though
I
counselled
her
not
to
say
much
;
for
a
second
journey
would
make
us
better
judges
.
<EOS>
My
master
requested
an
account
of
our
ongoings
.
<EOS>
His
nephew
's
offering
of
thanks
was
duly
delivered
,
Miss
Cathy
gently
touching
on
the
rest
:
I
also
threw
little
light
on
his
inquiries
,
for
I
hardly
knew
what
to
hide
and
what
to
reveal
.
    
<EOS>
Seven
days
glided
away
,
every
one
marking
its
course
by
the
henceforth
rapid
alteration
of
Edgar
Linton
's
state
.
<EOS>
The
havoc
that
months
had
previously
wrought
was
now
emulated
by
the
inroads
of
hours
.
<EOS>
Catherine
we
would
fain
have
deluded
yet
;
but
her
own
quick
spirit
refused
to
delude
her
:
it
divined
in
secret
,
and
brooded
on
the
dreadful
probability
,
gradually
ripening
into
certainty
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
the
heart
to
mention
her
ride
,
when
Thursday
came
round
;
I
mentioned
it
for
her
,
and
obtained
permission
to
order
her
out
of
doors
:
for
the
library
,
where
her
father
stopped
a
short
time
daily
 
<EOS>
the
brief
period
he
could
bear
to
sit
up
 
and
his
chamber
,
had
become
her
whole
world
.
<EOS>
She
grudged
each
moment
that
did
not
find
her
bending
over
his
pillow
,
or
seated
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
Her
countenance
grew
wan
with
watching
and
sorrow
,
and
my
master
gladly
dismissed
her
to
what
he
flattered
himself
would
be
a
happy
change
of
scene
and
society
;
drawing
comfort
from
the
hope
that
she
would
not
now
be
left
entirely
alone
after
his
death
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
a
fixed
idea
<EOS>
,
I
guessed
by
several
observations
he
let
fall
,
that
,
as
his
nephew
resembled
him
in
person
,
he
would
resemble
him
in
mind
;
for
Linton
's
letters
bore
few
or
no
indications
of
his
defective
character
.
<EOS>
And
I
,
through
pardonable
weakness
,
refrained
from
correcting
the
error
;
asking
myself
what
good
there
would
be
in
disturbing
his
last
moments
with
information
that
he
had
neither
power
nor
opportunity
to
turn
to
account
.
  
<EOS>
We
deferred
our
excursion
till
the
afternoon
;
a
golden
afternoon
of
August
:
every
breath
from
the
hills
so
full
of
life
,
that
it
seemed
whoever
respired
it
,
though
dying
,
might
revive
.
<EOS>
Catherine
's
face
was
just
like
the
landscape
 
shadows
and
sunshine
flitting
over
it
in
rapid
succession
;
but
the
shadows
rested
longer
,
and
the
sunshine
was
more
transient
;
and
her
poor
little
heart
reproached
itself
for
even
that
passing
forgetfulness
of
its
cares
.
  
<EOS>
We
discerned
Linton
watching
at
the
same
spot
he
had
selected
before
.
<EOS>
My
young
mistress
alighted
,
and
told
me
that
,
as
she
was
resolved
to
stay
a
very
little
while
,
I
had
better
hold
the
pony
and
remain
on
horseback
;
but
I
dissented
:
I
would
n't
risk
losing
sight
of
the
charge
committed
to
me
a
minute
;
so
we
climbed
the
slope
of
heath
together
.
<EOS>
Master
Heathcliff
received
us
with
greater
animation
on
this
occasion
:
not
the
animation
of
high
spirits
though
,
nor
yet
of
joy
;
it
looked
more
like
fear
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
late
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
speaking
short
and
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
Is
not
your
father
very
ill
?
<EOS>
I
thought
you
would
n't
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
Why
_
wo
n't
you
be
candid
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Catherine
,
swallowing
her
greeting
.
<EOS>
"
Why
can
not
you
say
at
once
you
do
n't
want
me
?
<EOS>
It
is
strange
,
Linton
,
that
for
the
second
time
you
have
brought
me
here
on
purpose
,
apparently
to
distress
us
both
,
and
for
no
reason
besides
!
"
  
<EOS>
Linton
shivered
,
and
glanced
at
her
,
half
supplicating
,
half
ashamed
;
but
his
cousin
's
patience
was
not
sufficient
to
endure
this
enigmatical
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
_
is
_
very
ill
,
"
she
said
;
"
and
why
am
I
called
from
his
bedside
?
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
you
send
to
absolve
me
from
my
promise
,
when
you
wished
I
would
n't
keep
it
?
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
I
desire
an
explanation
:
<EOS>
playing
and
trifling
are
completely
banished
out
of
my
mind
;
and
I
ca
n't
dance
attendance
on
your
affectations
now
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
affectations
!
"
<EOS>
he
murmured
;
"
what
are
they
?
<EOS>
For
heaven
's
sake
,
Catherine
,
do
n't
look
so
angry
!
<EOS>
Despise
me
as
much
as
you
please
;
I
am
a
worthless
,
cowardly
wretch
:
I
ca
n't
be
scorned
enough
;
but
I
'm
too
mean
for
your
anger
.
<EOS>
Hate
my
father
,
and
spare
me
for
contempt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
"
cried
Catherine
in
a
passion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Foolish
,
silly
boy
!
<EOS>
And
there
!
<EOS>
he
trembles
:
as
if
I
were
really
going
to
touch
him
!
<EOS>
You
need
n't
bespeak
contempt
,
Linton
:
anybody
will
have
it
spontaneously
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
Get
off
!
<EOS>
I
shall
return
home
:
it
is
folly
dragging
you
from
the
hearth
-
stone
,
and
pretending
 
what
do
we
pretend
?
<EOS>
Let
go
my
frock
!
<EOS>
If
I
pitied
you
for
crying
and
looking
so
very
frightened
,
you
should
spurn
such
pity
.
<EOS>
Ellen
,
tell
him
how
disgraceful
this
conduct
is
.
<EOS>
Rise
,
and
do
n't
degrade
yourself
into
an
abject
reptile
 
<EOS>
_
do
n't
_
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
streaming
face
and
an
expression
of
agony
,
Linton
had
thrown
his
nerveless
frame
along
the
ground
:
he
seemed
convulsed
with
exquisite
terror
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
he
sobbed
,
"
I
can
not
bear
it
!
<EOS>
Catherine
,
Catherine
<EOS>
,
I
'm
a
traitor
,
too
,
and
I
dare
not
tell
you
!
<EOS>
But
leave
me
,
and
I
shall
be
killed
!
<EOS>
_
Dear
_
Catherine
,
my
life
is
in
your
hands
:
and
you
have
said
you
loved
me
,
and
if
you
did
,
it
would
n't
harm
you
.
<EOS>
You
'll
not
go
,
then
?
<EOS>
kind
,
sweet
,
good
Catherine
!
<EOS>
And
perhaps
you
_
will
_
consent
 
<EOS>
and
he
'll
let
me
die
with
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
My
young
lady
,
on
witnessing
his
intense
anguish
,
stooped
to
raise
him
.
<EOS>
The
old
feeling
of
indulgent
tenderness
overcame
her
vexation
,
and
she
grew
thoroughly
moved
and
alarmed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Consent
to
what
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
"
<EOS>
To
stay
!
<EOS>
tell
me
the
meaning
of
this
strange
talk
,
and
I
will
.
<EOS>
You
contradict
your
own
words
,
and
distract
me
!
<EOS>
Be
calm
and
frank
,
and
confess
at
once
all
that
weighs
on
your
heart
.
<EOS>
You
would
n't
injure
me
,
Linton
,
would
you
?
<EOS>
You
would
n't
let
any
enemy
hurt
me
,
if
you
could
prevent
it
?
<EOS>
I
'll
believe
you
are
a
coward
,
for
yourself
,
but
not
a
cowardly
betrayer
of
your
best
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
my
father
threatened
me
,
"
gasped
the
boy
,
clasping
his
attenuated
fingers
,
"
and
I
dread
him
 
<EOS>
I
dread
him
!
<EOS>
I
_
dare
_
not
tell
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
well
!
"
said
Catherine
,
with
scornful
compassion
,
"
keep
your
secret
:
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
'm
_
no
coward
.
<EOS>
Save
yourself
:
<EOS>
I
'm
not
afraid
!
"
  
<EOS>
Her
magnanimity
provoked
his
tears
:
he
wept
wildly
,
kissing
her
supporting
hands
,
and
yet
could
not
summon
courage
to
speak
out
.
<EOS>
I
was
cogitating
what
the
mystery
might
be
,
and
determined
Catherine
should
never
suffer
to
benefit
him
or
any
one
else
,
by
my
good
will
;
when
,
hearing
a
rustle
among
the
ling
,
I
looked
up
and
saw
Mr.
Heathcliff
almost
close
upon
us
,
descending
the
Heights
.
<EOS>
He
did
n't
cast
a
glance
towards
my
companions
,
though
they
were
sufficiently
near
for
Linton
's
sobs
to
be
audible
;
but
hailing
me
in
the
almost
hearty
tone
he
assumed
to
none
besides
,
and
the
sincerity
of
which
I
could
n't
avoid
doubting
,
he
said
    
"
It
is
something
to
see
you
so
near
to
my
house
,
Nelly
.
<EOS>
How
are
you
at
the
Grange
?
<EOS>
Let
us
hear
.
<EOS>
The
rumour
goes
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
lower
tone
,
"
that
Edgar
Linton
is
on
his
death
-
bed
:
perhaps
they
exaggerate
his
illness
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
my
master
is
dying
,
"
<EOS>
I
replied
:
"
it
is
true
enough
.
<EOS>
A
sad
thing
it
will
be
for
us
all
,
but
a
blessing
for
him
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
will
he
last
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
he
continued
,
looking
at
the
two
young
people
,
who
were
fixed
under
his
eye
 
<EOS>
Linton
appeared
as
if
he
could
not
venture
to
stir
or
raise
his
head
,
and
Catherine
could
not
move
,
on
his
account
 
"
because
that
lad
yonder
seems
determined
to
beat
me
;
and
I
'd
thank
his
uncle
to
be
quick
,
and
go
before
him
!
<EOS>
Hallo
!
<EOS>
has
the
whelp
been
playing
that
game
long
?
<EOS>
I
_
<EOS>
did
_
give
him
some
lessons
about
snivelling
.
<EOS>
Is
he
pretty
lively
with
Miss
Linton
generally
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lively
?
<EOS>
no
 
he
has
shown
the
greatest
distress
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
To
see
him
,
I
should
say
,
that
instead
of
rambling
with
his
sweetheart
on
the
hills
,
he
ought
to
be
in
bed
,
under
the
hands
of
a
doctor
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
shall
be
,
in
a
day
or
two
,
"
muttered
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
But
first
 
get
up
,
Linton
!
<EOS>
Get
up
!
"
<EOS>
he
shouted
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
grovel
on
the
ground
there
up
,
this
moment
!
"
  
<EOS>
Linton
had
sunk
prostrate
again
in
another
paroxysm
of
helpless
fear
,
caused
by
his
father
's
glance
towards
him
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
:
there
was
nothing
else
to
produce
such
humiliation
.
<EOS>
He
made
several
efforts
to
obey
,
but
his
little
strength
was
annihilated
for
the
time
,
and
he
fell
back
again
with
a
moan
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
advanced
,
and
lifted
him
to
lean
against
a
ridge
of
turf
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
he
,
with
curbed
ferocity
,
"
I
'm
getting
angry
and
if
you
do
n't
command
that
paltry
spirit
of
yours
 
<EOS>
_
damn
<EOS>
_
you
!
<EOS>
get
up
directly
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
father
,
"
he
panted
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
,
let
me
alone
,
or
I
shall
faint
.
<EOS>
I
've
done
as
you
wished
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
Catherine
will
tell
you
that
I
 
that
I
 
have
been
cheerful
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
keep
by
me
,
Catherine
;
give
me
your
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Take
mine
,
"
said
his
father
;
"
stand
on
your
feet
.
<EOS>
There
now
 
she
'll
lend
you
her
arm
<EOS>
:
that
's
right
,
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
You
would
imagine
I
was
the
devil
himself
,
Miss
Linton
,
to
excite
such
horror
.
<EOS>
Be
so
kind
as
to
walk
home
with
him
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
He
shudders
if
I
touch
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Linton
dear
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Catherine
,
"
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
go
to
Wuthering
Heights
:
papa
has
forbidden
me
.
<EOS>
He
'll
not
harm
you
:
why
are
you
so
afraid
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
never
re
-
enter
that
house
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
_
not
_
to
re
-
enter
it
without
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
cried
his
father
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
respect
Catherine
's
filial
scruples
.
<EOS>
Nelly
,
take
him
in
,
and
I
'll
follow
your
advice
concerning
the
doctor
,
without
delay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
do
well
,
"
replied
I.
"
<EOS>
But
I
must
remain
with
my
mistress
:
to
mind
your
son
is
not
my
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
stiff
,
"
said
Heathcliff
,
"
I
know
that
<EOS>
:
but
you
'll
force
me
to
pinch
the
baby
and
make
it
scream
before
it
moves
your
charity
.
<EOS>
Come
,
then
,
my
hero
.
<EOS>
Are
you
willing
to
return
,
escorted
by
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
approached
once
more
,
and
made
as
if
he
would
seize
the
fragile
being
;
but
,
shrinking
back
,
Linton
clung
to
his
cousin
,
and
implored
her
to
accompany
him
,
with
a
frantic
importunity
that
admitted
no
denial
.
<EOS>
However
I
disapproved
,
I
could
n't
hinder
her
:
indeed
,
how
could
she
have
refused
him
herself
?
<EOS>
What
was
filling
him
with
dread
<EOS>
we
had
no
means
of
discerning
;
but
there
he
was
,
powerless
under
its
gripe
,
and
any
addition
seemed
capable
of
shocking
him
into
idiotcy
.
<EOS>
We
reached
the
threshold
;
Catherine
walked
in
,
and
I
stood
waiting
till
she
had
conducted
the
invalid
to
a
chair
,
expecting
her
out
immediately
;
when
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
pushing
me
forward
,
exclaimed
 
"
My
house
is
not
stricken
with
the
plague
,
Nelly
;
and
I
have
a
mind
to
be
hospitable
to
-
day
:
sit
down
,
and
allow
me
to
shut
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
shut
and
locked
it
also
.
<EOS>
I
started
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
tea
before
you
go
home
,
"
he
added
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
by
myself
.
<EOS>
Hareton
is
gone
with
some
cattle
to
the
Lees
,
and
Zillah
and
Joseph
are
off
on
a
journey
of
pleasure
;
and
,
though
I
'm
used
to
being
alone
,
I
'd
rather
have
some
interesting
company
,
if
I
can
get
it
.
<EOS>
Miss
Linton
,
take
your
seat
by
_
him
_
.
<EOS>
I
give
you
what
I
have
:
the
present
is
hardly
worth
accepting
;
but
I
have
nothing
else
to
offer
.
<EOS>
It
is
Linton
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
How
she
does
stare
!
<EOS>
It
's
odd
what
a
savage
feeling
<EOS>
I
have
to
anything
that
seems
afraid
of
me
!
<EOS>
Had
I
been
born
where
laws
are
less
strict
and
tastes
less
dainty
,
I
should
treat
myself
to
a
slow
vivisection
of
those
two
,
as
an
evening
's
amusement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
drew
in
his
breath
,
struck
the
table
,
and
swore
to
himself
,
"
By
hell
!
<EOS>
I
hate
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
afraid
of
you
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Catherine
,
who
could
not
hear
the
latter
part
of
his
speech
.
<EOS>
She
stepped
close
up
;
her
black
eyes
flashing
with
passion
and
resolution
.
"
<EOS>
Give
me
that
key
:
I
will
have
it
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
eat
or
drink
here
,
if
I
were
starving
.
"
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
had
the
key
in
his
hand
that
remained
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
He
looked
up
,
seized
with
a
sort
of
surprise
at
her
boldness
;
or
,
possibly
,
reminded
,
by
her
voice
and
glance
,
of
the
person
from
whom
she
inherited
it
.
<EOS>
She
snatched
at
the
instrument
,
and
half
succeeded
in
getting
it
out
of
his
loosened
fingers
:
but
her
action
recalled
him
to
the
present
;
he
recovered
it
speedily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Catherine
Linton
,
"
he
said
,
"
stand
off
,
or
I
shall
knock
you
down
;
and
,
that
will
make
Mrs.
Dean
mad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Regardless
of
this
warning
,
she
captured
his
closed
hand
and
its
contents
again
.
<EOS>
"
We
_
will
_
go
!
"
<EOS>
she
repeated
,
exerting
her
utmost
efforts
to
cause
the
iron
muscles
to
relax
;
and
finding
that
her
nails
made
no
impression
,
she
applied
her
teeth
pretty
sharply
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
glanced
at
me
a
glance
that
kept
me
from
interfering
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Catherine
was
too
intent
on
his
fingers
to
notice
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
opened
them
suddenly
,
and
resigned
the
object
of
dispute
;
but
,
ere
she
had
well
secured
it
,
he
seized
her
with
the
liberated
hand
,
and
,
pulling
her
on
his
knee
,
administered
with
the
other
a
shower
of
terrific
slaps
on
both
sides
of
the
head
,
each
sufficient
to
have
fulfilled
his
threat
,
had
she
been
able
to
fall
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
diabolical
violence
I
rushed
on
him
furiously
.
"
<EOS>
You
villain
!
<EOS>
"
I
began
to
cry
,
"
you
villain
!
"
<EOS>
A
touch
on
the
chest
silenced
me
:
<EOS>
I
am
stout
,
and
soon
put
out
of
breath
;
and
,
what
with
that
and
the
rage
,
I
staggered
dizzily
back
and
felt
ready
to
suffocate
,
or
to
burst
a
blood
-
vessel
.
<EOS>
The
scene
was
over
in
two
minutes
;
Catherine
,
released
,
put
her
two
hands
to
her
temples
,
and
looked
just
as
if
she
were
not
sure
whether
her
ears
were
off
or
on
.
<EOS>
She
trembled
like
a
reed
,
poor
thing
,
and
leant
against
the
table
perfectly
bewildered
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
how
to
chastise
children
,
you
see
,
"
said
the
scoundrel
,
grimly
,
as
he
stooped
to
repossess
himself
of
the
key
,
which
had
dropped
to
the
floor
.
<EOS>
"
Go
to
Linton
now
,
as
I
told
you
;
and
cry
at
your
ease
!
<EOS>
I
shall
be
your
father
,
to
-
morrow
 
<EOS>
all
the
father
you
'll
have
in
a
few
days
 
<EOS>
and
you
shall
have
plenty
of
that
.
<EOS>
You
can
bear
plenty
;
you
're
no
weakling
:
you
shall
have
a
daily
taste
,
if
I
catch
such
a
devil
of
a
temper
in
your
eyes
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
Cathy
ran
to
me
instead
of
Linton
,
and
knelt
down
and
put
her
burning
cheek
on
my
lap
,
weeping
aloud
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
had
shrunk
into
a
corner
of
the
settle
,
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
,
congratulating
himself
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
that
the
correction
had
alighted
on
another
than
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
perceiving
us
all
confounded
,
rose
,
and
expeditiously
made
the
tea
himself
.
<EOS>
The
cups
and
saucers
were
laid
ready
.
<EOS>
He
poured
it
out
,
and
handed
me
a
cup
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wash
away
your
spleen
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
help
your
own
naughty
pet
and
mine
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
poisoned
,
though
I
prepared
it
.
<EOS>
I
'm
going
out
to
seek
your
horses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Our
first
thought
,
on
his
departure
,
was
to
force
an
exit
somewhere
.
<EOS>
We
tried
the
kitchen
door
,
but
that
was
fastened
outside
:
we
looked
at
the
windows
 
<EOS>
they
were
too
narrow
for
even
Cathy
's
little
figure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Master
Linton
,
"
I
cried
,
seeing
we
were
regularly
imprisoned
,
"
you
know
what
your
diabolical
father
is
after
,
and
you
shall
tell
us
,
or
I
'll
box
your
ears
,
as
he
has
done
your
cousin
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Linton
,
you
must
tell
,
"
said
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
for
your
sake
I
came
;
and
it
will
be
wickedly
ungrateful
if
you
refuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
some
tea
,
I
'm
thirsty
,
and
then
I
'll
tell
you
,
"
he
answered
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dean
,
go
away
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
you
standing
over
me
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Catherine
,
you
are
letting
your
tears
fall
into
my
cup
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
drink
that
.
<EOS>
Give
me
another
.
"
<EOS>
Catherine
pushed
another
to
him
,
and
wiped
her
face
.
<EOS>
I
felt
disgusted
at
the
little
wretch
's
composure
,
since
he
was
no
longer
in
terror
for
himself
.
<EOS>
The
anguish
he
had
exhibited
on
the
moor
subsided
as
soon
as
ever
he
entered
Wuthering
Heights
;
so
I
guessed
he
had
been
menaced
with
an
awful
visitation
of
wrath
if
he
failed
in
decoying
us
there
;
and
,
that
accomplished
,
he
had
no
further
immediate
fears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
wants
us
to
be
married
,
"
he
continued
,
after
sipping
some
of
the
liquid
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
knows
your
papa
would
n't
let
us
marry
now
;
and
he
's
afraid
of
my
dying
if
we
wait
;
so
we
are
to
be
married
in
the
morning
,
and
you
are
to
stay
here
all
night
;
and
,
if
you
do
as
he
wishes
,
you
shall
return
home
next
day
,
and
take
me
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
you
with
her
,
pitiful
changeling
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
_
You
_
marry
?
<EOS>
Why
,
the
man
is
mad
!
<EOS>
or
he
thinks
us
fools
,
every
one
.
<EOS>
And
do
you
imagine
that
beautiful
young
lady
,
that
healthy
,
hearty
girl
,
will
tie
herself
to
a
little
perishing
monkey
like
you
?
<EOS>
Are
you
cherishing
the
notion
that
anybody
,
let
alone
Miss
Catherine
Linton
,
would
have
you
for
a
husband
?
<EOS>
You
want
whipping
for
bringing
us
in
here
at
all
,
with
your
dastardly
puling
tricks
:
and
 
do
n't
look
so
silly
,
now
!
<EOS>
I
've
a
very
good
mind
to
shake
you
severely
,
for
your
contemptible
treachery
,
and
your
imbecile
conceit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
give
him
a
slight
shaking
;
but
it
brought
on
the
cough
,
and
he
took
to
his
ordinary
resource
of
moaning
and
weeping
,
and
Catherine
rebuked
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
all
night
?
<EOS>
No
,
"
she
said
,
looking
slowly
round
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ellen
,
I
'll
burn
that
door
down
<EOS>
but
I
'll
get
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
she
would
have
commenced
the
execution
of
her
threat
directly
,
but
Linton
was
up
in
alarm
for
his
dear
self
again
.
<EOS>
He
clasped
her
in
his
two
feeble
arms
sobbing
:
 
"
Wo
n't
you
have
me
,
and
save
me
?
<EOS>
not
let
me
come
to
the
Grange
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
darling
Catherine
!
<EOS>
you
must
n't
go
and
leave
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
You
_
must
_
obey
my
father
 
<EOS>
you
_
must
_
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
obey
my
own
,
"
she
replied
,
"
and
relieve
him
from
this
cruel
suspense
.
<EOS>
The
whole
night
!
<EOS>
What
would
he
think
?
<EOS>
He
'll
be
distressed
already
.
<EOS>
I
'll
either
break
or
burn
a
way
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Be
quiet
!
<EOS>
You
're
in
no
danger
;
but
if
you
hinder
me
 
Linton
,
I
love
papa
better
than
you
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
mortal
terror
he
felt
of
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
anger
restored
to
the
boy
his
coward
's
eloquence
.
<EOS>
Catherine
was
near
distraught
:
still
,
she
persisted
that
she
must
go
home
,
and
tried
entreaty
in
her
turn
,
persuading
him
to
subdue
his
selfish
agony
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
thus
occupied
,
our
jailor
re
-
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
beasts
have
trotted
off
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
 
now
Linton
!
<EOS>
snivelling
again
?
<EOS>
What
has
she
been
doing
to
you
?
<EOS>
Come
,
come
 
have
done
,
and
get
to
bed
.
<EOS>
In
a
month
or
two
,
my
lad
,
you
'll
be
able
to
pay
her
back
her
present
tyrannies
with
a
vigorous
hand
.
<EOS>
You
're
pining
for
pure
love
,
are
you
not
?
<EOS>
nothing
else
in
the
world
:
<EOS>
and
she
shall
have
you
!
<EOS>
There
,
to
bed
!
<EOS>
Zillah
wo
n't
be
here
to
-
night
;
you
must
undress
yourself
.
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
hold
your
noise
!
<EOS>
Once
in
your
own
room
,
I
'll
not
come
near
you
:
you
need
n't
fear
.
<EOS>
By
chance
,
you
've
managed
tolerably
.
<EOS>
I
'll
look
to
the
rest
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
spoke
these
words
,
holding
the
door
open
for
his
son
to
pass
,
and
the
latter
achieved
his
exit
exactly
as
a
spaniel
might
which
suspected
the
person
who
attended
on
it
of
designing
a
spiteful
squeeze
.
<EOS>
The
lock
was
re
-
secured
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
approached
the
fire
,
where
my
mistress
and
I
stood
silent
.
<EOS>
Catherine
looked
up
,
and
instinctively
raised
her
hand
to
her
cheek
:
his
neighbourhood
revived
a
painful
sensation
.
<EOS>
Anybody
else
would
have
been
incapable
of
regarding
the
childish
act
with
sternness
,
but
he
scowled
on
her
and
muttered
 
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
are
not
afraid
of
me
?
<EOS>
Your
courage
is
well
disguised
:
you
seem
damnably
afraid
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
am
_
afraid
now
,
<EOS>
"
she
replied
,
"
because
,
if
I
stay
,
papa
will
be
miserable
:
and
how
can
I
endure
making
him
miserable
 
when
he
 
when
he
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
let
_
<EOS>
me
<EOS>
_
go
home
!
<EOS>
I
promise
to
marry
Linton
:
<EOS>
papa
would
like
me
to
:
and
I
love
him
.
<EOS>
Why
should
you
wish
to
force
me
to
do
what
I
'll
willingly
do
of
myself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
him
dare
to
force
you
,
"
I
cried
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
law
in
the
land
,
thank
God
!
<EOS>
there
is
;
though
we
be
in
an
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
place
.
<EOS>
I
'd
inform
if
he
were
my
own
son
:
and
it
's
felony
without
benefit
of
clergy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Silence
!
"
said
the
ruffian
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
the
devil
with
your
clamour
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
_
you
_
to
speak
.
<EOS>
Miss
Linton
,
I
shall
enjoy
myself
remarkably
in
thinking
your
father
will
be
miserable
:
I
shall
not
sleep
for
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
You
could
have
hit
on
no
surer
way
of
fixing
your
residence
under
my
roof
for
the
next
twenty
-
four
hours
than
informing
me
that
such
an
event
would
follow
.
<EOS>
As
to
your
promise
to
marry
Linton
,
I
'll
take
care
<EOS>
you
shall
keep
it
;
for
you
shall
not
quit
this
place
till
it
is
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Send
Ellen
,
then
,
to
let
papa
know
I
'm
safe
!
"
exclaimed
Catherine
,
weeping
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
Or
marry
me
now
.
<EOS>
Poor
papa
!
<EOS>
Ellen
,
he
'll
think
we
're
lost
.
<EOS>
What
shall
we
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
he
!
<EOS>
He
'll
think
you
are
tired
of
waiting
on
him
,
and
run
off
for
a
little
amusement
,
"
answered
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
deny
that
you
entered
my
house
of
your
own
accord
,
in
contempt
of
his
injunctions
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
quite
natural
that
you
should
desire
amusement
at
your
age
;
and
that
you
would
weary
of
nursing
a
sick
man
,
and
that
man
_
<EOS>
only
_
your
father
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
his
happiest
days
were
over
when
your
days
began
.
<EOS>
He
cursed
you
,
I
dare
say
,
for
coming
into
the
world
(
I
did
,
at
least
)
;
and
it
would
just
do
if
he
cursed
you
as
_
<EOS>
he
_
went
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
'd
join
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
love
you
!
<EOS>
How
should
I
?
<EOS>
Weep
away
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
can
see
,
it
will
be
your
chief
diversion
hereafter
;
unless
Linton
make
amends
for
other
losses
:
and
your
provident
parent
appears
to
fancy
he
may
.
<EOS>
His
letters
of
advice
and
consolation
entertained
me
vastly
.
<EOS>
In
his
last
he
recommended
my
jewel
to
be
careful
of
his
;
and
kind
to
her
when
he
got
her
.
<EOS>
Careful
and
kind
 
<EOS>
that
's
paternal
.
<EOS>
But
Linton
requires
his
whole
stock
of
care
and
kindness
for
himself
.
<EOS>
Linton
can
play
the
little
tyrant
well
.
<EOS>
He
'll
undertake
to
torture
any
number
of
cats
,
if
their
teeth
be
drawn
and
their
claws
pared
.
<EOS>
You
'll
be
able
to
tell
his
uncle
fine
tales
of
his
_
kindness
_
,
when
you
get
home
again
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
right
there
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
;
"
explain
your
son
's
character
.
<EOS>
Show
his
resemblance
to
yourself
:
and
then
,
I
hope
,
Miss
Cathy
will
think
twice
before
she
takes
the
cockatrice
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
much
mind
speaking
of
his
amiable
qualities
now
<EOS>
,
"
he
answered
;
"
because
she
must
either
accept
him
or
remain
a
prisoner
,
and
you
along
with
her
,
till
your
master
dies
.
<EOS>
I
can
detain
you
both
,
quite
concealed
,
here
.
<EOS>
If
you
doubt
,
encourage
her
to
retract
her
word
,
and
you
'll
have
an
opportunity
of
judging
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
retract
my
word
,
"
said
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
marry
him
within
this
hour
,
if
I
may
go
to
Thrushcross
Grange
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
you
're
a
cruel
man
,
but
you
're
not
a
fiend
;
and
you
wo
n't
,
from
_
mere
_
malice
,
destroy
irrevocably
all
my
happiness
.
<EOS>
If
papa
thought
I
had
left
him
on
purpose
,
and
if
he
died
before
I
returned
,
could
I
bear
to
live
?
<EOS>
I
've
given
over
crying
:
<EOS>
but
I
'm
going
to
kneel
here
,
at
your
knee
;
and
I
'll
not
get
up
,
and
I
'll
not
take
my
eyes
from
your
face
till
you
look
back
at
me
!
<EOS>
No
,
do
n't
turn
away
!
<EOS>
_
do
look
_
!
<EOS>
you
'll
see
nothing
to
provoke
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
hate
you
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
angry
that
you
struck
me
.
<EOS>
Have
you
never
loved
_
anybody
_
<EOS>
in
all
your
life
,
uncle
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
never
_
?
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
must
look
once
.
<EOS>
I
'm
so
wretched
,
you
ca
n't
help
being
sorry
and
pitying
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
your
eft
's
fingers
off
;
and
move
,
or
I
'll
kick
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Heathcliff
,
brutally
repulsing
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
rather
be
hugged
by
a
snake
.
<EOS>
How
the
devil
can
you
dream
of
fawning
on
me
?
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
_
detest
<EOS>
_
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
:
shook
himself
,
indeed
,
as
if
his
flesh
crept
with
aversion
;
and
thrust
back
his
chair
;
while
I
got
up
,
and
opened
my
mouth
,
to
commence
a
downright
torrent
of
abuse
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
rendered
dumb
in
the
middle
of
the
first
sentence
,
by
a
threat
that
I
should
be
shown
into
a
room
by
myself
the
very
next
syllable
I
uttered
.
<EOS>
It
was
growing
dark
 
<EOS>
we
heard
a
sound
of
voices
at
the
garden
-
gate
.
<EOS>
Our
host
hurried
out
instantly
:
<EOS>
_
he
_
had
his
wits
about
him
;
_
we
_
had
not
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
talk
of
two
or
three
minutes
,
and
he
returned
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
had
been
your
cousin
Hareton
,
"
I
observed
to
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
would
arrive
!
<EOS>
Who
knows
but
he
might
take
our
part
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
three
servants
sent
to
seek
you
from
the
Grange
,
"
said
Heathcliff
,
overhearing
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
opened
a
lattice
and
called
out
:
but
I
could
swear
that
chit
is
glad
you
did
n't
.
<EOS>
She
's
glad
to
be
obliged
to
stay
,
I
'm
certain
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
learning
the
chance
we
had
missed
,
we
both
gave
vent
to
our
grief
without
control
;
and
he
allowed
us
to
wail
on
till
nine
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Then
he
bid
us
go
upstairs
,
through
the
kitchen
,
to
Zillah
's
chamber
;
and
I
whispered
my
companion
to
obey
:
perhaps
we
might
contrive
to
get
through
the
window
there
,
or
into
a
garret
,
and
out
by
its
skylight
.
<EOS>
The
window
,
however
,
was
narrow
,
like
those
below
,
and
the
garret
trap
was
safe
from
our
attempts
;
for
we
were
fastened
in
as
before
.
<EOS>
We
neither
of
us
lay
down
:
<EOS>
Catherine
took
her
station
by
the
lattice
,
and
watched
anxiously
for
morning
;
a
deep
sigh
being
the
only
answer
I
could
obtain
to
my
frequent
entreaties
that
she
would
try
to
rest
.
<EOS>
I
seated
myself
in
a
chair
,
and
rocked
to
and
fro
,
passing
harsh
judgment
on
my
many
derelictions
of
duty
;
from
which
,
it
struck
me
then
,
all
the
misfortunes
of
my
employers
sprang
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
case
,
in
reality
,
I
am
aware
;
but
it
was
,
in
my
imagination
,
that
dismal
night
;
and
I
thought
Heathcliff
himself
less
guilty
than
I.
  
<EOS>
At
seven
o'clock
he
came
,
and
inquired
if
Miss
Linton
had
risen
.
<EOS>
She
ran
to
the
door
immediately
,
and
answered
,
"
Yes
.
"
<EOS>
"
Here
,
then
,
"
he
said
,
opening
it
,
and
pulling
her
out
.
<EOS>
I
rose
to
follow
,
but
he
turned
the
lock
again
.
<EOS>
I
demanded
my
release
.
  
<EOS>
"
Be
patient
,
"
he
replied
;
"
I
'll
send
up
your
breakfast
in
a
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
thumped
on
the
panels
,
and
rattled
the
latch
angrily
and
Catherine
asked
why
I
was
still
shut
up
?
<EOS>
He
answered
,
I
must
try
to
endure
it
another
hour
,
and
they
went
away
.
<EOS>
I
endured
it
two
or
three
hours
;
at
length
,
I
heard
a
footstep
:
<EOS>
not
Heathcliff
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
brought
you
something
to
eat
,
"
said
a
voice
;
"
oppen
t
'
door
!
"
  
<EOS>
Complying
eagerly
,
I
beheld
Hareton
,
laden
with
food
enough
to
last
me
all
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tak
'
it
,
"
he
added
,
thrusting
the
tray
into
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
one
minute
,
"
I
began
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
cried
he
,
and
retired
,
regardless
of
any
prayers
I
could
pour
forth
to
detain
him
.
  
<EOS>
And
there
I
remained
enclosed
the
whole
day
,
and
the
whole
of
the
next
night
;
and
another
,
and
another
.
<EOS>
Five
nights
and
four
days
<EOS>
I
remained
,
altogether
,
seeing
nobody
but
Hareton
once
every
morning
;
and
he
was
a
model
of
a
jailor
:
surly
,
and
dumb
,
and
deaf
to
every
attempt
at
moving
his
sense
of
justice
or
compassion
.
    
<EOS>
On
the
fifth
morning
,
or
rather
afternoon
,
a
different
step
approached
 
lighter
and
shorter
;
and
,
this
time
,
the
person
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
was
Zillah
;
donned
in
her
scarlet
shawl
,
with
a
black
silk
bonnet
on
her
head
,
and
a
willow
-
basket
swung
to
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dean
!
<EOS>
"
she
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
there
is
a
talk
about
you
at
Gimmerton
.
<EOS>
I
never
thought
<EOS>
but
you
were
sunk
in
the
Blackhorse
marsh
,
and
missy
with
you
,
till
master
told
me
you
'd
been
found
,
and
he
'd
lodged
you
here
!
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
and
you
must
have
got
on
an
island
,
sure
?
<EOS>
And
how
long
were
you
in
the
hole
?
<EOS>
Did
master
save
you
,
Mrs.
Dean
?
<EOS>
But
you
're
not
so
thin
 
<EOS>
you
've
not
been
so
poorly
,
have
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
master
is
a
true
scoundrel
!
<EOS>
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
shall
answer
for
it
.
<EOS>
He
need
n't
have
raised
that
tale
:
it
shall
all
be
laid
bare
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
asked
Zillah
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
his
tale
:
they
tell
that
in
the
village
 
about
your
being
lost
in
the
marsh
;
and
I
calls
to
Earnshaw
,
when
I
come
in
 
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
they
's
queer
things
,
Mr.
Hareton
,
happened
since
I
went
off
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
sad
pity
of
that
likely
young
lass
,
and
ca
nt
Nelly
Dean
.
"
<EOS>
He
stared
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
had
not
heard
aught
,
so
I
told
him
the
rumour
.
<EOS>
The
master
listened
,
and
he
just
smiled
to
himself
,
and
said
,
"
If
they
have
been
in
the
marsh
,
they
are
out
now
,
Zillah
.
<EOS>
Nelly
Dean
is
lodged
,
at
this
minute
,
in
your
room
.
<EOS>
You
can
tell
her
to
flit
,
when
you
go
up
;
here
is
the
key
.
<EOS>
The
bog
-
water
got
into
her
head
,
and
she
would
have
run
home
quite
flighty
;
but
I
fixed
her
till
she
came
round
to
her
senses
.
<EOS>
You
can
bid
her
go
to
the
Grange
at
once
,
if
she
be
able
,
and
carry
a
message
from
me
,
that
her
young
lady
will
follow
in
time
to
attend
the
squire
's
funeral
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Edgar
is
not
dead
?
"
I
gasped
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Zillah
,
Zillah
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
sit
you
down
,
my
good
mistress
,
"
she
replied
;
"
you
're
right
sickly
yet
.
<EOS>
He
's
not
dead
;
Doctor
Kenneth
thinks
he
may
last
another
day
.
<EOS>
I
met
him
on
the
road
and
asked
.
"
  
<EOS>
Instead
of
sitting
down
,
I
snatched
my
outdoor
things
,
and
hastened
below
,
for
the
way
was
free
.
<EOS>
On
entering
the
house
,
I
looked
about
for
some
one
to
give
information
of
Catherine
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
filled
with
sunshine
,
and
the
door
stood
wide
open
;
but
nobody
seemed
at
hand
.
<EOS>
As
I
hesitated
whether
to
go
off
at
once
,
or
return
and
seek
my
mistress
,
a
slight
cough
drew
my
attention
to
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
Linton
lay
on
the
settle
,
sole
tenant
,
sucking
a
stick
of
sugar
-
candy
,
and
pursuing
my
movements
with
apathetic
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Miss
Catherine
?
<EOS>
"
I
demanded
sternly
,
supposing
I
could
frighten
him
into
giving
intelligence
,
by
catching
him
thus
,
alone
.
<EOS>
He
sucked
on
like
an
innocent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
gone
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
replied
;
<EOS>
"
she
's
upstairs
:
<EOS>
she
's
not
to
go
;
we
wo
n't
let
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
let
her
,
little
idiot
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
Direct
me
to
her
room
immediately
,
or
I
'll
make
you
sing
out
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
would
make
you
sing
out
,
if
you
attempted
to
get
there
,
"
he
answered
.
"
<EOS>
He
says
I
'm
not
to
be
soft
with
Catherine
:
she
's
my
wife
,
and
it
's
shameful
that
she
should
wish
to
leave
me
.
<EOS>
He
says
she
hates
me
and
wants
me
to
die
,
that
she
may
have
my
money
;
but
she
sha
n't
have
it
:
and
she
sha
n't
go
home
!
<EOS>
She
never
shall
!
 
<EOS>
she
may
cry
,
and
be
sick
as
much
as
she
pleases
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
resumed
his
former
occupation
,
closing
his
lids
,
as
if
he
meant
to
drop
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
"
Master
Heathcliff
,
"
<EOS>
I
resumed
,
"
have
you
forgotten
all
Catherine
's
kindness
to
you
last
winter
,
when
you
affirmed
you
loved
her
,
and
when
she
brought
you
books
and
sung
you
songs
,
and
came
many
a
time
through
wind
and
snow
to
see
you
?
<EOS>
She
wept
to
miss
one
evening
,
because
you
would
be
disappointed
;
and
you
felt
then
that
she
was
a
hundred
times
too
good
to
you
:
and
now
you
believe
the
lies
your
father
tells
,
though
you
know
he
detests
you
both
.
<EOS>
And
you
join
him
against
her
.
<EOS>
That
's
fine
gratitude
,
is
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
corner
of
Linton
's
mouth
fell
,
and
he
took
the
sugar
-
candy
from
his
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
she
come
to
Wuthering
Heights
because
she
hated
you
?
<EOS>
"
I
continued
.
<EOS>
"
Think
for
yourself
!
<EOS>
As
to
your
money
,
she
does
not
even
know
that
you
will
have
any
.
<EOS>
And
you
say
she
's
sick
;
and
yet
you
leave
her
alone
,
up
there
in
a
strange
house
!
<EOS>
You
who
have
felt
what
it
is
to
be
so
neglected
!
<EOS>
You
could
pity
your
own
sufferings
;
and
she
pitied
them
,
too
;
but
you
wo
n't
pity
hers
!
<EOS>
I
shed
tears
,
Master
Heathcliff
<EOS>
,
you
see
 
an
elderly
woman
,
and
a
servant
merely
 
and
you
,
after
pretending
such
affection
,
and
having
reason
to
worship
her
almost
,
store
every
tear
you
have
for
yourself
,
and
lie
there
quite
at
ease
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
're
a
heartless
,
selfish
boy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
stay
with
her
,
"
he
answered
crossly
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
stay
by
myself
.
<EOS>
She
cries
so
I
ca
n't
bear
it
.
<EOS>
And
she
wo
n't
give
over
,
though
I
say
I
'll
call
my
father
.
<EOS>
I
did
call
him
once
,
and
he
threatened
to
strangle
her
if
she
was
not
quiet
;
but
she
began
again
the
instant
he
left
the
room
,
moaning
and
grieving
all
night
long
,
though
I
screamed
for
vexation
that
I
could
n't
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr.
Heathcliff
out
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
perceiving
that
the
wretched
creature
had
no
power
to
sympathize
with
his
cousin
's
mental
tortures
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
in
the
court
,
"
he
replied
,
"
talking
to
Doctor
Kenneth
;
who
says
uncle
is
dying
,
truly
,
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
,
for
I
shall
be
master
of
the
Grange
after
him
.
<EOS>
Catherine
always
spoke
of
it
as
her
house
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
hers
!
<EOS>
It
's
mine
:
papa
says
everything
she
has
is
mine
.
<EOS>
All
her
nice
books
are
mine
;
she
offered
to
give
me
them
,
and
her
pretty
birds
,
and
her
pony
Minny
,
if
I
would
get
the
key
of
our
room
,
and
let
her
out
;
but
I
told
her
she
had
nothing
to
give
,
they
were
all
,
all
mine
.
<EOS>
And
then
she
cried
,
and
took
a
little
picture
from
her
neck
,
and
said
I
should
have
that
;
two
pictures
in
a
gold
case
,
on
one
side
her
mother
,
and
on
the
other
uncle
,
when
they
were
young
.
<EOS>
That
was
yesterday
 
<EOS>
I
said
they
were
mine
,
too
;
and
tried
to
get
them
from
her
.
<EOS>
The
spiteful
thing
would
n't
let
me
:
she
pushed
me
off
,
and
hurt
me
.
<EOS>
I
shrieked
out
 
that
frightens
<EOS>
her
 
<EOS>
she
heard
papa
coming
,
and
she
broke
the
hinges
and
divided
the
case
,
and
gave
me
her
mother
's
portrait
;
the
other
she
attempted
to
hide
:
but
papa
asked
what
was
the
matter
,
and
I
explained
it
.
<EOS>
He
took
the
one
I
had
away
,
and
ordered
her
to
resign
hers
to
me
;
she
refused
,
and
he
 
he
struck
her
down
,
and
wrenched
it
off
the
chain
,
and
crushed
it
with
his
foot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
were
you
pleased
to
see
her
struck
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
:
having
my
designs
in
encouraging
his
talk
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
winked
,
"
he
answered
:
"
I
wink
to
see
my
father
strike
a
dog
or
a
horse
,
he
does
it
so
hard
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
was
glad
at
first
 
<EOS>
she
deserved
punishing
for
pushing
me
:
but
when
papa
was
gone
,
she
made
me
come
to
the
window
and
showed
me
her
cheek
cut
on
the
inside
,
against
her
teeth
,
and
her
mouth
filling
with
blood
;
and
then
she
gathered
up
the
bits
of
the
picture
,
and
went
and
sat
down
with
her
face
to
the
wall
,
and
she
has
never
spoken
to
me
since
:
<EOS>
and
I
sometimes
think
she
ca
n't
speak
for
pain
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
to
think
so
;
but
she
's
a
naughty
thing
for
crying
continually
;
and
she
looks
so
pale
and
wild
<EOS>
,
I
'm
afraid
of
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
can
get
the
key
if
you
choose
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
when
I
am
up
-
stairs
,
"
he
answered
;
"
but
I
ca
n't
walk
up
-
stairs
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
what
apartment
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
he
cried
,
"
I
sha
n't
tell
_
you
_
where
it
is
.
<EOS>
It
is
our
secret
.
<EOS>
Nobody
,
neither
Hareton
nor
Zillah
,
is
to
know
.
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
you
've
tired
me
 
<EOS>
go
away
,
go
away
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
turned
his
face
on
to
his
arm
,
and
shut
his
eyes
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
considered
it
best
to
depart
without
seeing
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
and
bring
a
rescue
for
my
young
lady
from
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
it
,
the
astonishment
of
my
fellow
-
servants
to
see
me
,
and
their
joy
also
,
was
intense
;
and
when
they
heard
that
their
little
mistress
was
safe
,
two
or
three
were
about
to
hurry
up
and
shout
the
news
at
Mr.
Edgar
's
door
:
<EOS>
but
I
bespoke
the
announcement
of
it
myself
.
<EOS>
How
changed
I
found
him
,
even
in
those
few
days
!
<EOS>
He
lay
an
image
of
sadness
and
resignation
awaiting
his
death
.
<EOS>
Very
young
he
looked
:
though
his
actual
age
was
thirty
-
nine
,
one
would
have
called
him
ten
years
younger
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
Catherine
;
for
he
murmured
her
name
.
<EOS>
I
touched
his
hand
,
and
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Catherine
is
coming
,
dear
master
!
"
<EOS>
I
whispered
;
"
she
is
alive
and
well
;
and
will
be
here
,
I
hope
,
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
trembled
at
the
first
effects
of
this
intelligence
:
he
half
rose
up
,
looked
eagerly
round
the
apartment
,
and
then
sank
back
in
a
swoon
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
recovered
,
I
related
our
compulsory
visit
,
and
detention
at
the
Heights
.
<EOS>
I
said
Heathcliff
forced
me
to
go
in
:
which
was
not
quite
true
.
<EOS>
I
uttered
as
little
as
possible
against
Linton
;
nor
did
I
describe
all
his
father
's
brutal
conduct
 
<EOS>
my
intentions
being
to
add
no
bitterness
,
if
I
could
help
it
,
to
his
already
over
-
flowing
cup
.
  
<EOS>
He
divined
that
one
of
his
enemy
's
purposes
was
to
secure
the
personal
property
,
as
well
as
the
estate
,
to
his
son
:
or
rather
himself
;
yet
why
he
did
not
wait
till
his
decease
was
a
puzzle
to
my
master
,
because
ignorant
how
nearly
he
and
his
nephew
would
quit
the
world
together
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
felt
that
his
will
had
better
be
altered
:
<EOS>
instead
of
leaving
Catherine
's
fortune
at
her
own
disposal
,
he
determined
to
put
it
in
the
hands
of
trustees
for
her
use
during
life
,
and
for
her
children
,
if
she
had
any
,
after
her
.
<EOS>
By
that
means
,
it
could
not
fall
to
Mr.
Heathcliff
should
Linton
die
.
  
<EOS>
Having
received
his
orders
,
I
despatched
a
man
to
fetch
the
attorney
,
and
four
more
,
provided
with
serviceable
weapons
,
to
demand
my
young
lady
of
her
jailor
.
<EOS>
Both
parties
were
delayed
very
late
.
<EOS>
The
single
servant
returned
first
.
<EOS>
He
said
Mr.
Green
,
the
lawyer
,
was
out
when
he
arrived
at
his
house
,
and
he
had
to
wait
two
hours
for
his
re
-
entrance
;
and
then
Mr.
Green
told
him
he
had
a
little
business
in
the
village
that
must
be
done
;
but
he
would
be
at
Thrushcross
Grange
before
morning
.
<EOS>
The
four
men
came
back
unaccompanied
also
.
<EOS>
They
brought
word
that
Catherine
was
ill
:
too
ill
to
quit
her
room
;
and
Heathcliff
would
not
suffer
them
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
I
scolded
the
stupid
fellows
well
for
listening
to
that
tale
,
which
I
would
not
carry
to
my
master
;
resolving
to
take
a
whole
bevy
up
to
the
Heights
,
at
day
-
light
,
and
storm
it
literally
,
unless
the
prisoner
were
quietly
surrendered
to
us
.
<EOS>
Her
father
_
shall
_
see
her
,
I
vowed
,
and
vowed
again
,
if
that
devil
be
killed
on
his
own
doorstones
in
trying
to
prevent
it
!
  
<EOS>
Happily
,
I
was
spared
the
journey
and
the
trouble
.
<EOS>
I
had
gone
down
-
stairs
at
three
o'clock
to
fetch
a
jug
of
water
;
and
was
passing
through
the
hall
with
it
in
my
hand
,
when
a
sharp
knock
at
the
front
door
made
me
jump
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
is
Green
,
"
I
said
,
recollecting
myself
 
"
only
Green
,
"
and
I
went
on
,
intending
to
send
somebody
else
to
open
it
;
but
the
knock
was
repeated
:
not
loud
,
and
still
importunately
.
<EOS>
I
put
the
jug
on
the
banister
and
hastened
to
admit
him
myself
.
<EOS>
The
harvest
moon
shone
clear
outside
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
My
own
sweet
little
mistress
sprang
on
my
neck
sobbing
,
"
Ellen
,
Ellen
!
<EOS>
Is
papa
alive
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
cried
:
"
yes
,
my
angel
,
he
is
,
God
be
thanked
,
you
are
safe
with
us
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
run
,
breathless
as
she
was
,
up
-
stairs
to
Mr.
Linton
's
room
;
but
I
compelled
her
to
sit
down
on
a
chair
,
and
made
her
drink
,
and
washed
her
pale
face
,
chafing
it
into
a
faint
colour
with
my
apron
.
<EOS>
Then
I
said
I
must
go
first
,
and
tell
of
her
arrival
;
imploring
her
to
say
,
she
should
be
happy
with
young
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
She
stared
,
but
soon
comprehending
why
I
counselled
her
to
utter
the
falsehood
,
she
assured
me
she
would
not
complain
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
n't
abide
to
be
present
at
their
meeting
.
<EOS>
I
stood
outside
the
chamber
-
door
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
hardly
ventured
near
the
bed
,
then
.
<EOS>
All
was
composed
,
however
:
Catherine
's
despair
was
as
silent
as
her
father
's
joy
.
<EOS>
She
supported
him
calmly
,
in
appearance
;
and
he
fixed
on
her
features
his
raised
eyes
that
seemed
dilating
with
ecstasy
.
  
<EOS>
He
died
blissfully
,
Mr.
Lockwood
:
he
died
so
.
<EOS>
Kissing
her
cheek
,
he
murmured
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
her
;
and
you
,
darling
child
,
shall
come
to
us
!
"
and
never
stirred
or
spoke
again
;
but
continued
that
rapt
,
radiant
gaze
,
till
his
pulse
imperceptibly
stopped
and
his
soul
departed
.
<EOS>
None
could
have
noticed
the
exact
minute
of
his
death
,
it
was
so
entirely
without
a
struggle
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
Catherine
had
spent
her
tears
,
or
whether
the
grief
were
too
weighty
to
let
them
flow
,
she
sat
there
dry
-
eyed
till
the
sun
rose
:
she
sat
till
noon
,
and
would
still
have
remained
brooding
over
that
deathbed
,
but
I
insisted
on
her
coming
away
and
taking
some
repose
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
<EOS>
I
succeeded
in
removing
her
,
for
at
dinner
-
time
<EOS>
appeared
the
lawyer
,
having
called
at
Wuthering
Heights
to
get
his
instructions
how
to
behave
.
<EOS>
He
had
sold
himself
to
Mr.
Heathcliff
:
that
was
the
cause
of
his
delay
in
obeying
my
master
's
summons
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
no
thought
of
worldly
affairs
crossed
the
latter
's
mind
,
to
disturb
him
,
after
his
daughter
's
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Green
took
upon
himself
to
order
everything
and
everybody
about
the
place
.
<EOS>
He
gave
all
the
servants
but
me
,
notice
to
quit
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
carried
his
delegated
authority
to
the
point
of
insisting
that
Edgar
Linton
should
not
be
buried
beside
his
wife
,
but
in
the
chapel
,
with
his
family
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
will
,
however
,
to
hinder
that
,
and
my
loud
protestations
against
any
infringement
of
its
directions
.
<EOS>
The
funeral
was
hurried
over
;
Catherine
,
Mrs.
Linton
Heathcliff
now
,
was
suffered
to
stay
at
the
Grange
till
her
father
's
corpse
had
quitted
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
told
me
that
her
anguish
had
at
last
spurred
Linton
to
incur
the
risk
of
liberating
her
.
<EOS>
She
heard
the
men
I
sent
disputing
at
the
door
,
and
she
gathered
the
sense
of
Heathcliff
's
answer
.
<EOS>
It
drove
her
desperate
.
<EOS>
Linton
who
had
been
conveyed
up
to
the
little
parlour
soon
after
I
left
,
was
terrified
into
fetching
the
key
before
his
father
re
-
ascended
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
cunning
to
unlock
and
re
-
lock
the
door
,
without
shutting
it
;
and
when
he
should
have
gone
to
bed
,
he
begged
to
sleep
with
Hareton
,
and
his
petition
was
granted
for
once
.
<EOS>
Catherine
stole
out
before
break
of
day
.
<EOS>
She
dared
not
try
the
doors
lest
the
dogs
should
raise
an
alarm
;
she
visited
the
empty
chambers
and
examined
their
windows
;
and
,
luckily
,
lighting
on
her
mother
's
,
she
got
easily
out
of
its
lattice
,
and
on
to
the
ground
,
by
means
of
the
fir
-
tree
close
by
.
<EOS>
Her
accomplice
suffered
for
his
share
in
the
escape
,
notwithstanding
his
timid
contrivances
.
    
<EOS>
The
evening
after
the
funeral
,
my
young
lady
and
I
were
seated
in
the
library
;
now
musing
mournfully
 
one
of
us
despairingly
 
on
our
loss
,
now
venturing
conjectures
as
to
the
gloomy
future
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
just
agreed
the
best
destiny
which
could
await
Catherine
would
be
a
permission
to
continue
resident
at
the
Grange
;
at
least
during
Linton
's
life
:
he
being
allowed
to
join
her
there
,
and
I
to
remain
as
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
That
seemed
rather
too
favourable
an
arrangement
to
be
hoped
for
;
and
yet
I
did
hope
,
and
began
to
cheer
up
under
the
prospect
of
retaining
my
home
and
my
employment
,
and
,
above
all
,
my
beloved
young
mistress
;
when
a
servant
 
one
of
the
discarded
ones
,
not
yet
departed
 
rushed
hastily
in
,
and
said
"
that
devil
Heathcliff
"
was
coming
through
the
court
:
should
he
fasten
the
door
in
his
face
?
  
<EOS>
If
we
had
been
mad
enough
to
order
that
proceeding
,
we
had
not
time
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
ceremony
of
knocking
or
announcing
his
name
:
he
was
master
,
and
availed
himself
of
the
master
's
privilege
to
walk
straight
in
,
without
saying
a
word
.
<EOS>
The
sound
of
our
informant
's
voice
directed
him
to
the
library
;
he
entered
and
motioning
him
out
,
shut
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
same
room
into
which
he
had
been
ushered
,
as
a
guest
,
eighteen
years
before
:
the
same
moon
shone
through
the
window
;
and
the
same
autumn
landscape
lay
outside
.
<EOS>
We
had
not
yet
lighted
a
candle
,
but
all
the
apartment
was
visible
,
even
to
the
portraits
on
the
wall
:
<EOS>
the
splendid
head
of
Mrs.
Linton
,
and
the
graceful
one
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
advanced
to
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
Time
had
little
altered
his
person
either
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
same
man
:
his
dark
face
rather
sallower
and
more
composed
,
his
frame
a
stone
or
two
heavier
,
perhaps
,
and
no
other
difference
.
<EOS>
Catherine
had
risen
with
an
impulse
to
dash
out
,
when
she
saw
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
arresting
her
by
the
arm
.
"
<EOS>
No
more
runnings
away
!
<EOS>
Where
would
you
go
?
<EOS>
I
'm
come
to
fetch
you
home
;
and
I
hope
you
'll
be
a
dutiful
daughter
and
not
encourage
my
son
to
further
disobedience
.
<EOS>
I
was
embarrassed
how
to
punish
him
when
I
discovered
his
part
in
the
business
:
he
's
such
a
cobweb
,
a
pinch
would
annihilate
him
;
but
you
'll
see
by
his
look
that
he
has
received
his
due
!
<EOS>
I
brought
him
down
one
evening
,
the
day
before
yesterday
,
and
just
set
him
in
a
chair
,
and
never
touched
him
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
sent
Hareton
out
,
and
we
had
the
room
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
In
two
hours
,
I
called
Joseph
to
carry
him
up
again
;
and
since
then
my
presence
is
as
potent
on
his
nerves
as
a
ghost
;
and
I
fancy
he
sees
me
often
,
though
I
am
not
near
.
<EOS>
Hareton
says
he
wakes
and
shrieks
in
the
night
by
the
hour
together
,
and
calls
you
to
protect
him
from
me
;
and
,
whether
you
like
your
precious
mate
,
or
not
,
you
must
come
:
he
's
your
concern
now
;
I
yield
all
my
interest
in
him
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
let
Catherine
continue
here
,
"
I
pleaded
,
"
and
send
Master
Linton
to
her
?
<EOS>
As
you
hate
them
both
,
you
'd
not
miss
them
:
they
can
only
be
a
daily
plague
to
your
unnatural
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
seeking
a
tenant
for
the
Grange
,
"
he
answered
;
"
and
I
want
my
children
about
me
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
that
lass
owes
me
her
services
for
her
bread
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
going
to
nurture
her
in
luxury
and
idleness
after
Linton
is
gone
.
<EOS>
Make
haste
and
get
ready
,
now
;
and
do
n't
oblige
me
to
compel
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
,
"
said
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Linton
is
all
I
have
to
love
in
the
world
,
and
though
you
have
done
what
you
could
to
make
him
hateful
to
me
,
and
me
to
him
,
you
can
not
make
us
hate
each
other
.
<EOS>
And
I
defy
you
to
hurt
him
when
I
am
by
,
and
I
defy
you
to
frighten
me
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
boastful
champion
,
"
replied
Heathcliff
;
"
but
I
do
n't
like
you
well
enough
to
hurt
him
:
you
shall
get
the
full
benefit
of
the
torment
,
as
long
as
it
lasts
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
I
who
will
make
him
hateful
to
you
 
<EOS>
it
is
his
own
sweet
spirit
.
<EOS>
He
's
as
bitter
as
gall
at
your
desertion
and
its
consequences
:
do
n't
expect
thanks
for
this
noble
devotion
.
<EOS>
I
heard
him
draw
a
pleasant
picture
to
Zillah
of
what
he
would
do
if
he
were
as
strong
as
I
:
the
inclination
is
there
,
and
his
very
weakness
will
sharpen
his
wits
to
find
a
substitute
for
strength
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
has
a
bad
nature
,
"
said
Catherine
:
"
he
's
your
son
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
glad
I
've
a
better
,
to
forgive
it
;
and
I
know
he
loves
me
,
and
for
that
reason
I
love
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
_
<EOS>
you
_
have
_
nobody
_
to
love
you
;
and
,
however
miserable
you
make
us
,
we
shall
still
have
the
revenge
of
thinking
that
your
cruelty
arises
from
your
greater
misery
.
<EOS>
You
_
are
_
miserable
,
are
you
not
?
<EOS>
Lonely
,
like
the
devil
,
and
envious
like
him
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Nobody
_
loves
you
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
nobody
_
will
cry
for
you
when
you
die
!
<EOS>
I
would
n't
be
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
spoke
with
a
kind
of
dreary
triumph
:
she
seemed
to
have
made
up
her
mind
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
her
future
family
,
and
draw
pleasure
from
the
griefs
of
her
enemies
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
be
sorry
to
be
yourself
presently
,
"
said
her
father
-
in
-
law
,
"
if
you
stand
there
another
minute
.
<EOS>
Begone
,
witch
,
and
get
your
things
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
scornfully
withdrew
.
<EOS>
In
her
absence
I
began
to
beg
for
Zillah
's
place
at
the
Heights
,
offering
to
resign
mine
to
her
;
but
he
would
suffer
it
on
no
account
.
<EOS>
He
bid
me
be
silent
;
and
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
allowed
himself
a
glance
round
the
room
and
a
look
at
the
pictures
.
<EOS>
Having
studied
Mrs.
Linton
's
,
he
said
 
"
I
shall
have
that
home
.
<EOS>
Not
because
I
need
it
,
but
 
"
He
turned
abruptly
to
the
fire
,
and
continued
,
with
what
,
for
lack
of
a
better
word
,
I
must
call
a
smile
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
did
yesterday
!
<EOS>
I
got
the
sexton
,
who
was
digging
Linton
's
grave
,
to
remove
the
earth
off
her
coffin
lid
,
and
I
opened
it
.
<EOS>
I
thought
,
once
,
I
would
have
stayed
there
:
when
I
saw
her
face
again
 
<EOS>
it
is
hers
yet
!
 
<EOS>
he
had
hard
work
to
stir
me
;
but
he
said
it
would
change
if
the
air
blew
on
it
,
and
so
I
struck
one
side
of
the
coffin
loose
,
and
covered
it
up
:
not
Linton
's
side
,
damn
him
!
<EOS>
I
wish
he
'd
been
soldered
in
lead
.
<EOS>
And
I
bribed
the
sexton
to
pull
it
away
when
I
'm
laid
there
,
and
slide
mine
out
too
;
I
'll
have
it
made
so
:
and
then
by
the
time
Linton
gets
to
us
he
'll
not
know
which
is
which
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
very
wicked
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
;
"
were
you
not
ashamed
to
disturb
the
dead
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
disturbed
nobody
,
Nelly
,
"
he
replied
;
"
and
I
gave
some
ease
to
myself
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
a
great
deal
more
comfortable
now
;
and
you
'll
have
a
better
chance
of
keeping
me
underground
,
when
I
get
there
.
<EOS>
Disturbed
her
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
she
has
disturbed
me
,
night
and
day
,
through
eighteen
years
 
incessantly
 
remorselessly
 
till
yesternight
;
and
yesternight
<EOS>
I
was
tranquil
.
<EOS>
I
dreamt
<EOS>
I
was
sleeping
the
last
sleep
by
that
sleeper
,
with
my
heart
stopped
and
my
cheek
frozen
against
hers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
she
had
been
dissolved
into
earth
,
or
worse
,
what
would
you
have
dreamt
of
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
dissolving
with
her
,
and
being
more
happy
still
!
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
suppose
I
dread
any
change
of
that
sort
?
<EOS>
I
expected
such
a
transformation
on
raising
the
lid
 
<EOS>
but
I
'm
better
pleased
that
it
should
not
commence
till
I
share
it
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
unless
I
had
received
a
distinct
impression
of
her
passionless
features
,
that
strange
feeling
would
hardly
have
been
removed
.
<EOS>
It
began
oddly
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
was
wild
after
she
died
;
and
eternally
,
from
dawn
to
dawn
,
praying
her
to
return
to
me
her
spirit
!
<EOS>
I
have
a
strong
faith
in
ghosts
:
I
have
a
conviction
that
they
can
,
and
do
,
exist
among
us
!
<EOS>
The
day
she
was
buried
,
there
came
a
fall
of
snow
.
<EOS>
In
the
evening
I
went
to
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
It
blew
bleak
as
winter
 
<EOS>
all
round
was
solitary
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
fear
that
her
fool
of
a
husband
would
wander
up
the
glen
so
late
;
and
no
one
else
had
business
to
bring
them
there
.
<EOS>
Being
alone
,
and
conscious
two
yards
of
loose
earth
was
the
sole
barrier
between
us
,
I
said
to
myself
 
"
I
'll
have
her
in
my
arms
again
!
<EOS>
If
she
be
cold
,
I
'll
think
it
is
this
north
wind
that
chills
_
me
_
;
and
if
she
be
motionless
,
it
is
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
I
got
a
spade
from
the
tool
-
house
,
and
began
to
delve
with
all
my
might
 
<EOS>
it
scraped
the
coffin
;
I
fell
to
work
with
my
hands
;
the
wood
commenced
cracking
about
the
screws
;
I
was
on
the
point
of
attaining
my
object
,
when
it
seemed
that
I
heard
a
sigh
from
some
one
above
,
close
at
the
edge
of
the
grave
,
and
bending
down
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
can
only
get
this
off
,
"
I
muttered
,
"
I
wish
they
may
shovel
in
the
earth
over
us
both
!
"
<EOS>
and
I
wrenched
at
it
more
desperately
still
.
<EOS>
There
was
another
sigh
,
close
at
my
ear
.
<EOS>
I
appeared
to
feel
the
warm
breath
of
it
displacing
the
sleet
-
laden
wind
.
<EOS>
I
knew
no
living
thing
in
flesh
and
blood
was
by
;
but
,
as
certainly
as
you
perceive
the
approach
to
some
substantial
body
in
the
dark
,
though
it
can
not
be
discerned
,
so
certainly
I
felt
that
Cathy
was
there
:
not
under
me
,
but
on
the
earth
.
<EOS>
A
sudden
sense
of
relief
flowed
from
my
heart
through
every
limb
.
<EOS>
I
relinquished
my
labour
of
agony
,
and
turned
consoled
at
once
:
unspeakably
consoled
.
<EOS>
Her
presence
was
with
me
:
it
remained
while
I
re
-
filled
the
grave
,
and
led
me
home
.
<EOS>
You
may
laugh
,
if
you
will
;
but
I
was
sure
I
should
see
her
there
.
<EOS>
I
was
sure
she
was
with
me
,
and
I
could
not
help
talking
to
her
.
<EOS>
Having
reached
the
Heights
,
I
rushed
eagerly
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
was
fastened
;
and
,
I
remember
,
that
accursed
Earnshaw
and
my
wife
opposed
my
entrance
.
<EOS>
I
remember
stopping
to
kick
the
breath
out
of
him
,
and
then
hurrying
up
-
stairs
,
to
my
room
and
hers
.
<EOS>
I
looked
round
impatiently
 
<EOS>
I
felt
her
by
me
 
<EOS>
I
could
_
<EOS>
almost
_
see
her
,
and
yet
I
_
could
not
_
!
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
sweat
blood
then
,
from
the
anguish
of
my
yearning
 
from
the
fervour
of
my
supplications
to
have
but
one
glimpse
!
<EOS>
I
had
not
one
.
<EOS>
She
showed
herself
,
as
she
often
was
in
life
,
a
devil
to
me
!
<EOS>
And
,
since
then
,
sometimes
more
and
sometimes
less
,
I
've
been
the
sport
of
that
intolerable
torture
!
<EOS>
Infernal
!
<EOS>
keeping
my
nerves
at
such
a
stretch
that
,
if
they
had
not
resembled
catgut
,
they
would
long
ago
have
relaxed
to
the
feebleness
of
Linton
's
.
<EOS>
When
I
sat
in
the
house
with
Hareton
,
it
seemed
that
on
going
out
I
should
meet
her
;
when
I
walked
on
the
moors
I
should
meet
her
coming
in
.
<EOS>
When
I
went
from
home
I
hastened
to
return
;
she
_
must
_
be
somewhere
at
the
Heights
<EOS>
,
I
was
certain
!
<EOS>
And
when
I
slept
in
her
chamber
 
<EOS>
I
was
beaten
out
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
lie
there
;
for
the
moment
I
closed
my
eyes
,
she
was
either
outside
the
window
,
or
sliding
back
the
panels
,
or
entering
the
room
,
or
even
resting
her
darling
head
on
the
same
pillow
as
she
did
when
a
child
;
and
I
must
open
my
lids
to
see
.
<EOS>
And
so
I
opened
and
closed
them
a
hundred
times
a
night
 
to
be
always
disappointed
!
<EOS>
It
racked
me
!
<EOS>
I
've
often
groaned
aloud
,
till
that
old
rascal
Joseph
no
doubt
believed
that
my
conscience
was
playing
the
fiend
inside
of
me
.
<EOS>
Now
,
since
I
've
seen
her
,
I
'm
pacified
 
a
little
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
strange
way
of
killing
:
not
by
inches
,
but
by
fractions
of
hairbreadths
,
to
beguile
me
with
the
spectre
of
a
hope
through
eighteen
years
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
paused
and
wiped
his
forehead
;
his
hair
clung
to
it
,
wet
with
perspiration
;
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
red
embers
of
the
fire
,
the
brows
not
contracted
,
but
raised
next
the
temples
;
diminishing
the
grim
aspect
of
his
countenance
,
but
imparting
a
peculiar
look
of
trouble
,
and
a
painful
appearance
of
mental
tension
towards
one
absorbing
subject
.
<EOS>
He
only
half
addressed
me
,
and
I
maintained
silence
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
like
to
hear
him
talk
!
<EOS>
After
a
short
period
he
resumed
his
meditation
on
the
picture
,
took
it
down
and
leant
it
against
the
sofa
to
contemplate
it
at
better
advantage
;
and
while
so
occupied
Catherine
entered
,
announcing
that
she
was
ready
,
when
her
pony
should
be
saddled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Send
that
over
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Heathcliff
to
me
;
then
turning
to
her
,
he
added
:
"
You
may
do
without
your
pony
:
it
is
a
fine
evening
,
and
you
'll
need
no
ponies
at
Wuthering
Heights
;
for
what
journeys
you
take
,
your
own
feet
will
serve
you
.
<EOS>
Come
along
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
Ellen
!
"
whispered
my
dear
little
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
kissed
me
,
her
lips
felt
like
ice
.
<EOS>
"
Come
and
see
me
,
Ellen
;
do
n't
forget
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
care
you
do
no
such
thing
,
Mrs.
Dean
!
"
said
her
new
father
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
wish
to
speak
to
you
I
'll
come
here
.
<EOS>
I
want
none
of
your
prying
at
my
house
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
signed
her
to
precede
him
;
and
casting
back
a
look
that
cut
my
heart
,
she
obeyed
.
<EOS>
I
watched
them
,
from
the
window
,
walk
down
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
fixed
Catherine
's
arm
under
his
:
though
she
disputed
the
act
at
first
evidently
;
and
with
rapid
strides
he
hurried
her
into
the
alley
,
whose
trees
concealed
them
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
paid
a
visit
to
the
Heights
,
but
I
have
not
seen
her
since
she
left
:
<EOS>
Joseph
held
the
door
in
his
hand
when
I
called
to
ask
after
her
,
and
would
n't
let
me
pass
.
<EOS>
He
said
Mrs.
Linton
was
"
thrang
,
"
and
the
master
was
not
in
.
<EOS>
Zillah
has
told
me
something
of
the
way
they
go
on
,
otherwise
I
should
hardly
know
who
was
dead
and
who
living
.
<EOS>
She
thinks
Catherine
haughty
,
and
does
not
like
her
,
I
can
guess
by
her
talk
.
<EOS>
My
young
lady
asked
some
aid
of
her
when
she
first
came
;
but
Mr.
Heathcliff
told
her
to
follow
her
own
business
,
and
let
his
daughter
-
in
-
law
look
after
herself
;
and
Zillah
willingly
acquiesced
,
being
a
narrow
-
minded
,
selfish
woman
.
<EOS>
Catherine
evinced
a
child
's
annoyance
at
this
neglect
;
repaid
it
with
contempt
,
and
thus
enlisted
my
informant
among
her
enemies
,
as
securely
as
if
she
had
done
her
some
great
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
long
talk
with
Zillah
about
six
weeks
ago
,
a
little
before
you
came
,
one
day
when
we
foregathered
on
the
moor
;
and
this
is
what
she
told
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
first
thing
Mrs.
Linton
did
,
"
she
said
,
"
on
her
arrival
at
the
Heights
,
was
to
run
up
-
stairs
,
without
even
wishing
good
-
evening
to
me
and
Joseph
;
she
shut
herself
into
Linton
's
room
,
and
remained
till
morning
.
<EOS>
Then
,
while
the
master
and
Earnshaw
were
at
breakfast
,
she
entered
the
house
,
and
asked
all
in
a
quiver
if
the
doctor
might
be
sent
for
?
<EOS>
her
cousin
was
very
ill
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
We
know
that
!
"
<EOS>
answered
Heathcliff
;
"
but
his
life
is
not
worth
a
farthing
,
and
I
wo
n't
spend
a
farthing
on
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
But
I
can
not
tell
how
to
do
,
"
she
said
;
"
and
if
nobody
will
help
me
,
he
'll
die
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Walk
out
of
the
room
,
"
cried
the
master
,
"
and
let
me
never
hear
a
word
more
about
him
!
<EOS>
None
here
care
what
becomes
of
him
;
if
you
do
,
act
the
nurse
;
if
you
do
not
,
lock
him
up
and
leave
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
she
began
to
bother
me
,
and
I
said
I
'd
had
enough
plague
with
the
tiresome
thing
;
we
each
had
our
tasks
,
and
hers
was
to
wait
on
Linton
<EOS>
:
Mr.
Heathcliff
bid
me
leave
that
labour
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
they
managed
together
,
I
ca
n't
tell
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
he
fretted
a
great
deal
,
and
moaned
hisseln
night
and
day
;
and
she
had
precious
little
rest
:
one
could
guess
by
her
white
face
and
heavy
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
sometimes
came
into
the
kitchen
all
wildered
like
,
and
looked
as
if
she
would
fain
beg
assistance
;
but
I
was
not
going
to
disobey
the
master
:
<EOS>
I
never
dare
disobey
him
,
Mrs.
Dean
;
and
,
though
I
thought
it
wrong
that
Kenneth
should
not
be
sent
for
,
it
was
no
concern
of
mine
either
to
advise
or
complain
,
and
I
always
refused
to
meddle
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
,
after
we
had
gone
to
bed
,
I
've
happened
to
open
my
door
again
and
seen
her
sitting
crying
on
the
stairs'-top
;
and
then
I
've
shut
myself
in
quick
,
for
fear
of
being
moved
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
I
did
pity
her
then
,
I
'm
sure
:
still
I
did
n't
wish
to
lose
my
place
,
you
know
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
last
,
one
night
she
came
boldly
into
my
chamber
,
and
frightened
me
out
of
my
wits
,
by
saying
,
"
Tell
Mr.
Heathcliff
that
his
son
is
dying
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
he
is
,
this
time
.
<EOS>
Get
up
,
instantly
,
and
tell
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Having
uttered
this
speech
,
she
vanished
again
.
<EOS>
I
lay
a
quarter
of
an
hour
listening
and
trembling
.
<EOS>
Nothing
stirred
 
the
house
was
quiet
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
mistaken
,
I
said
to
myself
.
<EOS>
He
's
got
over
it
.
<EOS>
I
need
n't
disturb
them
;
and
I
began
to
doze
.
<EOS>
But
my
sleep
was
marred
a
second
time
by
a
sharp
ringing
of
the
bell
 
<EOS>
the
only
bell
we
have
,
put
up
on
purpose
for
Linton
;
and
the
master
called
to
me
to
see
what
was
the
matter
,
and
inform
them
that
he
would
n't
have
that
noise
repeated
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
delivered
Catherine
's
message
.
<EOS>
He
cursed
to
himself
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
came
out
with
a
lighted
candle
,
and
proceeded
to
their
room
.
<EOS>
I
followed
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Heathcliff
was
seated
by
the
bedside
,
with
her
hands
folded
on
her
knees
.
<EOS>
Her
father
-
in
-
law
went
up
,
held
the
light
to
Linton
's
face
,
looked
at
him
,
and
touched
him
;
afterwards
he
turned
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Now
 
Catherine
,
"
he
said
,
"
how
do
you
feel
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
dumb
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
How
do
you
feel
,
Catherine
?
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
He
's
safe
,
and
I
'm
free
,
"
she
answered
:
"
I
should
feel
well
 
<EOS>
but
,
"
she
continued
,
with
a
bitterness
she
could
n't
conceal
,
"
you
have
left
me
so
long
to
struggle
against
death
alone
,
that
I
feel
and
see
only
death
!
<EOS>
I
feel
like
death
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
she
looked
like
it
,
too
!
<EOS>
I
gave
her
a
little
wine
.
<EOS>
Hareton
and
Joseph
,
who
had
been
wakened
by
the
ringing
and
the
sound
of
feet
,
and
heard
our
talk
from
outside
,
now
entered
.
<EOS>
Joseph
was
fain
,
I
believe
,
of
the
lad
's
removal
;
Hareton
seemed
a
thought
bothered
:
though
he
was
more
taken
up
with
staring
at
Catherine
than
thinking
of
Linton
.
<EOS>
But
the
master
bid
him
get
off
to
bed
again
:
we
did
n't
want
his
help
.
<EOS>
He
afterwards
made
Joseph
remove
the
body
to
his
chamber
,
and
told
me
to
return
to
mine
,
and
Mrs.
Heathcliff
remained
by
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
morning
,
he
sent
me
to
tell
her
she
must
come
down
to
breakfast
:
she
had
undressed
,
and
appeared
going
to
sleep
,
and
said
she
was
ill
;
at
which
I
hardly
wondered
.
<EOS>
I
informed
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
and
he
replied
,
 
"
Well
,
let
her
be
till
after
the
funeral
;
and
go
up
now
and
then
to
get
her
what
is
needful
;
and
,
as
soon
as
she
seems
better
,
tell
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Cathy
stayed
upstairs
a
fortnight
,
according
to
Zillah
;
who
visited
her
twice
a
day
,
and
would
have
been
rather
more
friendly
,
but
her
attempts
at
increasing
kindness
were
proudly
and
promptly
repelled
.
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
went
up
once
,
to
show
her
Linton
's
will
.
<EOS>
He
had
bequeathed
the
whole
of
his
,
and
what
had
been
her
,
moveable
property
,
to
his
father
:
the
poor
creature
was
threatened
,
or
coaxed
,
into
that
act
during
her
week
's
absence
,
when
his
uncle
died
.
<EOS>
The
lands
,
being
a
minor
,
he
could
not
meddle
with
.
<EOS>
However
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
has
claimed
and
kept
them
in
his
wife
's
right
and
his
also
:
I
suppose
legally
;
at
any
rate
,
Catherine
,
destitute
of
cash
and
friends
,
can
not
disturb
his
possession
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
,
"
said
Zillah
,
"
ever
approached
her
door
,
except
that
once
,
but
I
;
and
nobody
asked
anything
about
her
.
<EOS>
The
first
occasion
of
her
coming
down
into
the
house
was
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
She
had
cried
out
,
when
I
carried
up
her
dinner
,
that
she
could
n't
bear
any
longer
being
in
the
cold
;
and
I
told
her
the
master
was
going
to
Thrushcross
Grange
,
and
Earnshaw
and
I
need
n't
hinder
her
from
descending
;
so
,
as
soon
as
she
heard
Heathcliff
's
horse
trot
off
,
she
made
her
appearance
,
donned
in
black
,
and
her
yellow
curls
combed
back
behind
her
ears
as
plain
as
a
Quaker
<EOS>
:
she
could
n't
comb
them
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Joseph
and
I
generally
go
to
chapel
on
Sundays
:
"
the
kirk
,
you
know
,
has
no
minister
now
,
explained
Mrs.
Dean
;
and
they
call
the
Methodists
'
or
Baptists
'
place
(
I
ca
n't
say
which
it
is
)
at
Gimmerton
,
a
chapel
.
"
<EOS>
Joseph
had
gone
,
"
she
continued
,
"
but
I
thought
proper
to
bide
at
home
.
<EOS>
Young
folks
are
always
the
better
for
an
elder
's
over
-
looking
;
and
Hareton
,
with
all
his
bashfulness
,
is
n't
a
model
of
nice
behaviour
.
<EOS>
I
let
him
know
that
his
cousin
would
very
likely
sit
with
us
,
and
she
had
been
always
used
to
see
the
Sabbath
respected
;
so
he
had
as
good
leave
his
guns
and
bits
of
indoor
work
alone
,
while
she
stayed
.
<EOS>
He
coloured
up
at
the
news
,
and
cast
his
eyes
over
his
hands
and
clothes
.
<EOS>
The
train
-
oil
and
gunpowder
were
shoved
out
of
sight
in
a
minute
.
<EOS>
I
saw
he
meant
to
give
her
his
company
;
and
I
guessed
,
by
his
way
,
he
wanted
to
be
presentable
;
<EOS>
so
,
laughing
,
as
I
durst
not
laugh
when
the
master
is
by
,
I
offered
to
help
him
,
if
he
would
,
and
joked
at
his
confusion
.
<EOS>
He
grew
sullen
,
and
began
to
swear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mrs.
Dean
,
"
Zillah
went
on
,
seeing
me
not
pleased
by
her
manner
<EOS>
,
"
you
happen
think
your
young
lady
too
fine
for
Mr.
Hareton
;
and
happen
you
're
right
:
<EOS>
but
I
own
I
should
love
well
to
bring
her
pride
a
peg
lower
.
<EOS>
And
what
will
all
her
learning
and
her
daintiness
do
for
her
,
now
?
<EOS>
She
's
as
poor
as
you
or
I
:
<EOS>
poorer
,
I
'll
be
bound
:
you
're
saying
,
and
I
'm
doing
my
little
all
that
road
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hareton
allowed
Zillah
to
give
him
her
aid
;
and
she
flattered
him
into
a
good
humour
;
so
,
when
Catherine
came
,
half
forgetting
her
former
insults
,
he
tried
to
make
himself
agreeable
,
by
the
housekeeper
's
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
Missis
walked
in
,
"
she
said
,
"
as
chill
as
an
icicle
,
and
as
high
as
a
princess
.
<EOS>
I
got
up
and
offered
her
my
seat
in
the
arm
-
chair
.
<EOS>
No
,
she
turned
up
her
nose
at
my
civility
.
<EOS>
Earnshaw
rose
,
too
,
and
bid
her
come
to
the
settle
,
and
sit
close
by
the
fire
:
he
was
sure
she
was
starved
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
've
been
starved
a
month
and
more
,
"
she
answered
,
resting
on
the
word
as
scornful
as
she
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
she
got
a
chair
for
herself
,
and
placed
it
at
a
distance
from
both
of
us
.
<EOS>
Having
sat
till
she
was
warm
,
she
began
to
look
round
,
and
discovered
a
number
of
books
on
the
dresser
;
she
was
instantly
upon
her
feet
again
,
stretching
to
reach
them
:
but
they
were
too
high
up
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
,
after
watching
her
endeavours
a
while
,
at
last
summoned
courage
to
help
her
;
she
held
her
frock
,
and
he
filled
it
with
the
first
that
came
to
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
a
great
advance
for
the
lad
.
<EOS>
She
did
n't
thank
him
;
still
,
he
felt
gratified
that
she
had
accepted
his
assistance
,
and
ventured
to
stand
behind
as
she
examined
them
,
and
even
to
stoop
and
point
out
what
struck
his
fancy
in
certain
old
pictures
which
they
contained
;
nor
was
he
daunted
by
the
saucy
style
in
which
she
jerked
the
page
from
his
finger
:
he
contented
himself
with
going
a
bit
farther
back
and
looking
at
her
instead
of
the
book
.
<EOS>
She
continued
reading
,
or
seeking
for
something
to
read
.
<EOS>
His
attention
became
,
by
degrees
,
quite
centred
in
the
study
of
her
thick
silky
curls
:
<EOS>
her
face
he
could
n't
see
,
and
she
could
n't
see
him
.
<EOS>
And
,
perhaps
,
not
quite
awake
to
what
he
did
,
but
attracted
like
a
child
to
a
candle
,
at
last
he
proceeded
from
staring
to
touching
;
he
put
out
his
hand
and
stroked
one
curl
,
as
gently
as
if
it
were
a
bird
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
stuck
a
knife
into
her
neck
,
she
started
round
in
such
a
taking
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Get
away
this
moment
!
<EOS>
How
dare
you
touch
me
?
<EOS>
Why
are
you
stopping
there
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
in
a
tone
of
disgust
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
endure
you
!
<EOS>
I
'll
go
upstairs
again
,
if
you
come
near
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Hareton
recoiled
,
looking
as
foolish
as
he
could
do
:
he
sat
down
in
the
settle
very
quiet
,
and
she
continued
turning
over
her
volumes
another
half
hour
;
finally
,
Earnshaw
crossed
over
,
and
whispered
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Will
you
ask
her
to
read
to
us
,
Zillah
?
<EOS>
I
'm
stalled
of
doing
naught
;
and
I
do
like
 
<EOS>
I
could
like
to
hear
her
!
<EOS>
Dunnot
say
I
wanted
it
,
but
ask
of
yourseln
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Mr
.
Hareton
wishes
you
would
read
to
us
,
ma'am
,
"
I
said
,
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
'd
take
it
very
kind
 
<EOS>
he
'd
be
much
obliged
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
frowned
;
and
looking
up
,
answered
    
"
"
Mr
.
Hareton
,
and
the
whole
set
of
you
,
will
be
good
enough
to
understand
that
I
reject
any
pretence
at
kindness
<EOS>
you
have
the
hypocrisy
to
offer
!
<EOS>
I
despise
you
,
and
will
have
nothing
to
say
to
any
of
you
!
<EOS>
When
I
would
have
given
my
life
for
one
kind
word
,
even
to
see
one
of
your
faces
,
you
all
kept
off
.
<EOS>
But
I
wo
n't
complain
to
you
!
<EOS>
I
'm
driven
down
here
by
the
cold
;
not
either
to
amuse
you
or
enjoy
your
society
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
What
could
I
ha
'
done
?
"
began
Earnshaw
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
was
I
to
blame
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
Oh
!
you
are
an
exception
,
"
answered
Mrs.
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
missed
such
a
concern
as
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
But
I
offered
more
than
once
,
and
asked
,
"
he
said
,
kindling
up
at
her
pertness
,
"
I
asked
Mr.
Heathcliff
to
let
me
wake
for
you
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
Be
silent
!
<EOS>
I
'll
go
out
of
doors
,
or
anywhere
,
rather
than
have
your
disagreeable
voice
in
my
ear
!
"
said
my
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hareton
muttered
she
might
go
to
hell
,
for
him
!
<EOS>
and
unslinging
his
gun
,
restrained
himself
from
his
Sunday
occupations
no
longer
.
<EOS>
He
talked
now
,
freely
enough
;
and
she
presently
saw
fit
to
retreat
to
her
solitude
:
but
the
frost
had
set
in
,
and
,
in
spite
of
her
pride
,
she
was
forced
to
condescend
to
our
company
,
more
and
more
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
took
care
<EOS>
there
should
be
no
further
scorning
at
my
good
nature
<EOS>
:
ever
since
,
I
've
been
as
stiff
as
herself
;
and
she
has
no
lover
or
liker
among
us
:
and
she
does
not
deserve
one
;
for
,
let
them
say
the
least
word
to
her
,
and
she
'll
curl
back
without
respect
of
any
one
.
<EOS>
She
'll
snap
at
the
master
himself
,
and
as
good
as
dares
him
to
thrash
her
;
and
the
more
hurt
she
gets
,
the
more
venomous
she
grows
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
first
,
on
hearing
this
account
from
Zillah
,
I
determined
to
leave
my
situation
,
take
a
cottage
,
and
get
Catherine
to
come
and
live
with
me
:
but
Mr.
Heathcliff
would
as
soon
permit
that
as
he
would
set
up
Hareton
in
an
independent
house
;
and
I
can
see
no
remedy
,
at
present
,
unless
she
could
marry
again
;
and
that
scheme
it
does
not
come
within
my
province
to
arrange
.
     
<EOS>
Thus
ended
Mrs.
Dean
's
story
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
doctor
's
prophecy
,
I
am
rapidly
recovering
strength
;
and
though
it
be
only
the
second
week
in
January
,
I
propose
getting
out
on
horseback
in
a
day
or
two
,
and
riding
over
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
to
inform
my
landlord
that
I
shall
spend
the
next
six
months
in
London
;
and
,
if
he
likes
,
he
may
look
out
for
another
tenant
to
take
the
place
after
October
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
pass
another
winter
here
for
much
.
    
<EOS>
Yesterday
was
bright
,
calm
,
and
frosty
.
<EOS>
I
went
to
the
Heights
as
I
proposed
:
my
housekeeper
entreated
me
to
bear
a
little
note
from
her
to
her
young
lady
,
and
I
did
not
refuse
,
for
the
worthy
woman
was
not
conscious
of
anything
odd
in
her
request
.
<EOS>
The
front
door
stood
open
,
but
the
jealous
gate
was
fastened
,
as
at
my
last
visit
;
I
knocked
and
invoked
Earnshaw
from
among
the
garden
-
beds
;
he
unchained
it
,
and
I
entered
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
is
as
handsome
a
rustic
as
need
be
seen
.
<EOS>
I
took
particular
notice
of
him
this
time
;
but
then
he
does
his
best
apparently
to
make
the
least
of
his
advantages
.
  
<EOS>
I
asked
if
Mr.
Heathcliff
were
at
home
?
<EOS>
He
answered
,
No
;
but
he
would
be
in
at
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
It
was
eleven
o'clock
,
and
I
announced
my
intention
of
going
in
and
waiting
for
him
;
at
which
he
immediately
flung
down
his
tools
and
accompanied
me
,
in
the
office
of
watchdog
,
not
as
a
substitute
for
the
host
.
  
<EOS>
We
entered
together
;
Catherine
was
there
,
making
herself
useful
in
preparing
some
vegetables
for
the
approaching
meal
;
she
looked
more
sulky
and
less
spirited
than
when
I
had
seen
her
first
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
raised
her
eyes
to
notice
me
,
and
continued
her
employment
with
the
same
disregard
to
common
forms
of
politeness
as
before
;
never
returning
my
bow
and
good
-
morning
by
the
slightest
acknowledgment
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
does
not
seem
so
amiable
,
"
I
thought
,
"
as
Mrs.
Dean
would
persuade
me
to
believe
.
<EOS>
She
's
a
beauty
,
it
is
true
;
but
not
an
angel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Earnshaw
surlily
bid
her
remove
her
things
to
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
"
Remove
them
yourself
,
"
she
said
,
pushing
them
from
her
as
soon
as
she
had
done
;
and
retiring
to
a
stool
by
the
window
,
where
she
began
to
carve
figures
of
birds
and
beasts
out
of
the
turnip
-
parings
in
her
lap
.
<EOS>
I
approached
her
,
pretending
to
desire
a
view
of
the
garden
;
and
,
as
I
fancied
,
adroitly
dropped
Mrs.
Dean
's
note
on
to
her
knee
,
unnoticed
by
Hareton
 
<EOS>
but
she
asked
aloud
,
"
What
is
that
?
"
<EOS>
And
chucked
it
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
letter
from
your
old
acquaintance
,
the
housekeeper
at
the
Grange
,
"
I
answered
;
annoyed
at
her
exposing
my
kind
deed
,
and
fearful
lest
it
should
be
imagined
a
missive
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
She
would
gladly
have
gathered
it
up
at
this
information
,
but
Hareton
beat
her
;
he
seized
and
put
it
in
his
waistcoat
,
saying
Mr.
Heathcliff
should
look
at
it
first
.
<EOS>
Thereat
,
Catherine
silently
turned
her
face
from
us
,
and
,
very
stealthily
,
drew
out
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
and
applied
it
to
her
eyes
;
and
her
cousin
,
after
struggling
awhile
to
keep
down
his
softer
feelings
,
pulled
out
the
letter
and
flung
it
on
the
floor
beside
her
,
as
ungraciously
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
Catherine
caught
and
perused
it
eagerly
;
then
she
put
a
few
questions
to
me
concerning
the
inmates
,
rational
and
irrational
,
of
her
former
home
;
and
gazing
towards
the
hills
,
murmured
in
soliloquy
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
be
riding
Minny
down
there
!
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
be
climbing
up
there
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
'm
tired
 
<EOS>
I
'm
_
stalled
_
,
Hareton
!
"
<EOS>
And
she
leant
her
pretty
head
back
against
the
sill
,
with
half
a
yawn
and
half
a
sigh
,
and
lapsed
into
an
aspect
of
abstracted
sadness
:
neither
caring
nor
knowing
whether
we
remarked
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
"
I
said
,
after
sitting
some
time
mute
,
"
you
are
not
aware
that
I
am
an
acquaintance
of
yours
?
<EOS>
so
intimate
that
I
think
it
strange
<EOS>
you
wo
n't
come
and
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
My
housekeeper
never
wearies
of
talking
about
and
praising
you
;
and
she
'll
be
greatly
disappointed
if
I
return
with
no
news
of
or
from
you
,
except
that
you
received
her
letter
and
said
nothing
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
appeared
to
wonder
at
this
speech
,
and
asked
,
    
"
Does
Ellen
like
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
very
well
,
"
I
replied
,
hesitatingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
tell
her
,
"
she
continued
,
"
that
I
would
answer
her
letter
,
but
I
have
no
materials
for
writing
:
not
even
a
book
from
which
I
might
tear
a
leaf
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
books
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
contrive
to
live
here
without
them
?
<EOS>
if
I
may
take
the
liberty
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
Though
provided
with
a
large
library
,
I
'm
frequently
very
dull
at
the
Grange
;
take
my
books
away
,
and
I
should
be
desperate
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
always
reading
,
when
I
had
them
,
"
said
Catherine
;
"
and
Mr.
Heathcliff
never
reads
;
so
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
destroy
my
books
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
had
a
glimpse
of
one
for
weeks
.
<EOS>
Only
once
,
I
searched
through
Joseph
's
store
of
theology
,
to
his
great
irritation
;
and
once
,
Hareton
,
I
came
upon
a
secret
stock
in
your
room
 
<EOS>
some
Latin
and
Greek
,
and
some
tales
and
poetry
:
<EOS>
all
old
friends
.
<EOS>
I
brought
the
last
here
 
<EOS>
and
you
gathered
them
,
as
a
magpie
gathers
silver
spoons
,
for
the
mere
love
of
stealing
!
<EOS>
They
are
of
no
use
to
you
;
or
else
you
concealed
them
in
the
bad
spirit
that
,
as
you
can
not
enjoy
them
,
nobody
else
shall
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
_
your
_
envy
counselled
Mr.
Heathcliff
to
rob
me
of
my
treasures
?
<EOS>
But
I
've
most
of
them
written
on
my
brain
and
printed
in
my
heart
,
and
you
can
not
deprive
me
of
those
!
"
  
<EOS>
Earnshaw
blushed
crimson
when
his
cousin
made
this
revelation
of
his
private
literary
accumulations
,
and
stammered
an
indignant
denial
of
her
accusations
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Hareton
is
desirous
of
increasing
his
amount
of
knowledge
,
"
I
said
,
coming
to
his
rescue
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
not
_
envious
_
,
but
_
emulous
_
of
your
attainments
.
<EOS>
He
'll
be
a
clever
scholar
in
a
few
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
wants
me
to
sink
into
a
dunce
,
meantime
,
"
answered
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
hear
him
trying
to
spell
and
read
to
himself
,
and
pretty
blunders
he
makes
!
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
repeat
Chevy
Chase
as
you
did
yesterday
:
it
was
extremely
funny
.
<EOS>
I
heard
you
;
and
I
heard
you
turning
over
the
dictionary
to
seek
out
the
hard
words
,
and
then
cursing
because
you
could
n't
read
their
explanations
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
young
man
evidently
thought
it
too
bad
that
he
should
be
laughed
at
for
his
ignorance
,
and
then
laughed
at
for
trying
to
remove
it
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
similar
notion
;
and
,
remembering
Mrs.
Dean
's
anecdote
of
his
first
attempt
at
enlightening
the
darkness
in
which
he
had
been
reared
,
I
observed
,
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
we
have
each
had
a
commencement
,
and
each
stumbled
and
tottered
on
the
threshold
;
had
our
teachers
scorned
instead
of
aiding
us
,
we
should
stumble
and
totter
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
<EOS>
she
replied
,
"
I
do
n't
wish
to
limit
his
acquirements
:
still
,
he
has
no
right
to
appropriate
what
is
mine
,
and
make
it
ridiculous
to
me
with
his
vile
mistakes
and
mispronunciations
!
<EOS>
Those
books
,
both
prose
and
verse
,
are
consecrated
to
me
by
other
associations
;
and
I
hate
to
have
them
debased
and
profaned
in
his
mouth
!
<EOS>
Besides
,
of
all
,
he
has
selected
my
favourite
pieces
that
I
love
the
most
to
repeat
,
as
if
out
of
deliberate
malice
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hareton
's
chest
heaved
in
silence
a
minute
<EOS>
:
he
laboured
under
a
severe
sense
of
mortification
and
wrath
,
which
it
was
no
easy
task
to
suppress
.
<EOS>
I
rose
,
and
,
from
a
gentlemanly
idea
of
relieving
his
embarrassment
,
took
up
my
station
in
the
doorway
,
surveying
the
external
prospect
as
I
stood
.
<EOS>
He
followed
my
example
,
and
left
the
room
;
but
presently
reappeared
,
bearing
half
a
dozen
volumes
in
his
hands
,
which
he
threw
into
Catherine
's
lap
,
exclaiming
<EOS>
,
 
"
Take
them
!
<EOS>
I
never
want
to
hear
,
or
read
,
or
think
of
them
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
have
them
now
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
connect
them
with
you
,
and
hate
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
opened
one
that
had
obviously
been
often
turned
over
,
and
read
a
portion
in
the
drawling
tone
of
a
beginner
;
then
laughed
,
and
threw
it
from
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
listen
,
"
she
continued
,
provokingly
,
commencing
a
verse
of
an
old
ballad
in
the
same
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
But
his
self
-
love
would
endure
no
further
torment
:
<EOS>
I
heard
,
and
not
altogether
disapprovingly
,
a
manual
check
given
to
her
saucy
tongue
.
<EOS>
The
little
wretch
had
done
her
utmost
to
hurt
her
cousin
's
sensitive
though
uncultivated
feelings
,
and
a
physical
argument
was
the
only
mode
he
had
of
balancing
the
account
,
and
repaying
its
effects
on
the
inflictor
.
<EOS>
He
afterwards
gathered
the
books
and
hurled
them
on
the
fire
.
<EOS>
I
read
in
his
countenance
what
anguish
it
was
to
offer
that
sacrifice
to
spleen
.
<EOS>
I
fancied
that
as
they
consumed
,
he
recalled
the
pleasure
they
had
already
imparted
,
and
the
triumph
and
ever
-
increasing
pleasure
he
had
anticipated
from
them
;
and
I
fancied
I
guessed
the
incitement
to
his
secret
studies
also
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
content
with
daily
labour
and
rough
animal
enjoyments
,
till
Catherine
crossed
his
path
.
<EOS>
Shame
at
her
scorn
,
and
hope
of
her
approval
,
were
his
first
prompters
to
higher
pursuits
;
and
instead
of
guarding
him
from
one
and
winning
him
to
the
other
,
his
endeavours
to
raise
himself
had
produced
just
the
contrary
result
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
that
's
all
the
good
that
such
a
brute
as
you
can
get
from
them
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Catherine
,
sucking
her
damaged
lip
,
and
watching
the
conflagration
with
indignant
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'd
<EOS>
_
better
<EOS>
_
hold
your
tongue
,
now
<EOS>
,
"
he
answered
fiercely
.
  
<EOS>
And
his
agitation
precluded
further
speech
;
he
advanced
hastily
to
the
entrance
,
where
I
made
way
for
him
to
pass
.
<EOS>
But
ere
he
had
crossed
the
door
-
stones
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
coming
up
the
causeway
,
encountered
him
,
and
laying
hold
of
his
shoulder
asked
,
 
"
What
's
to
do
now
,
my
lad
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Naught
,
naught
,
"
he
said
,
and
broke
away
to
enjoy
his
grief
and
anger
in
solitude
.
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
gazed
after
him
,
and
sighed
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
odd
if
I
thwart
myself
,
"
he
muttered
,
unconscious
that
I
was
behind
him
.
"
<EOS>
But
when
I
look
for
his
father
in
his
face
,
I
find
_
her
_
every
day
more
!
<EOS>
How
the
devil
is
he
so
like
?
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
bear
to
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
bent
his
eyes
to
the
ground
,
and
walked
moodily
in
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
restless
,
anxious
expression
in
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
I
had
never
remarked
there
before
;
and
he
looked
sparer
in
person
.
<EOS>
His
daughter
-
in
-
law
,
on
perceiving
him
through
the
window
,
immediately
escaped
to
the
kitchen
,
so
that
I
remained
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
out
of
doors
again
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
"
he
said
,
in
reply
to
my
greeting
;
"
from
selfish
motives
partly
:
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
could
readily
supply
your
loss
in
this
desolation
.
<EOS>
I
've
wondered
more
than
once
what
brought
you
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
An
idle
whim
,
I
fear
,
<EOS>
sir
,
"
was
my
answer
;
"
or
else
an
idle
whim
is
going
to
spirit
me
away
.
<EOS>
I
shall
set
out
for
London
next
week
;
and
I
must
give
you
warning
that
I
feel
no
disposition
to
retain
Thrushcross
Grange
beyond
the
twelve
months
I
agreed
to
rent
it
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
shall
not
live
there
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
indeed
;
you
're
tired
of
being
banished
from
the
world
,
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
be
coming
to
plead
off
paying
for
a
place
you
wo
n't
occupy
,
your
journey
is
useless
:
I
never
relent
in
exacting
my
due
from
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
coming
to
plead
off
nothing
about
it
,
"
I
exclaimed
,
considerably
irritated
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Should
you
wish
it
,
I
'll
settle
with
you
now
,
"
and
I
drew
my
note
-
book
from
my
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
he
replied
,
coolly
;
"
you
'll
leave
sufficient
behind
to
cover
your
debts
,
if
you
fail
to
return
:
I
'm
not
in
such
a
hurry

<EOS>
Sit
down
and
take
your
dinner
with
us
;
a
guest
that
is
safe
from
repeating
his
visit
can
generally
be
made
welcome
.
<EOS>
Catherine
!
<EOS>
bring
the
things
in
<EOS>
:
where
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
reappeared
,
bearing
a
tray
of
knives
and
forks
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
get
your
dinner
with
Joseph
,
"
muttered
Heathcliff
,
aside
,
"
and
remain
in
the
kitchen
till
he
is
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
obeyed
his
directions
very
punctually
:
perhaps
she
had
no
temptation
to
transgress
.
<EOS>
Living
among
clowns
and
misanthropists
,
she
probably
can
not
appreciate
a
better
class
of
people
when
she
meets
them
.
  
<EOS>
With
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
grim
and
saturnine
,
on
the
one
hand
,
and
Hareton
,
absolutely
dumb
,
on
the
other
,
I
made
a
somewhat
cheerless
meal
,
and
bade
adieu
early
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
departed
by
the
back
way
,
to
get
a
last
glimpse
of
Catherine
and
annoy
old
Joseph
;
but
Hareton
received
orders
to
lead
up
my
horse
,
and
my
host
himself
escorted
me
to
the
door
,
so
I
could
not
fulfil
my
wish
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
dreary
life
gets
over
in
that
house
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
reflected
,
while
riding
down
the
road
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
realisation
of
something
more
romantic
than
a
fairy
tale
it
would
have
been
for
Mrs.
Linton
Heathcliff
,
had
she
<EOS>
and
I
struck
up
an
attachment
,
as
her
good
nurse
desired
,
and
migrated
together
into
the
stirring
atmosphere
of
the
town
!
"
    
<EOS>
1802
.
 
<EOS>
This
September
I
was
invited
to
devastate
the
moors
of
a
friend
in
the
north
,
and
on
my
journey
to
his
abode
,
I
unexpectedly
came
within
fifteen
miles
of
Gimmerton
.
<EOS>
The
ostler
at
a
roadside
public
-
house
was
holding
a
pail
of
water
to
refresh
my
horses
,
when
a
cart
of
very
green
oats
,
newly
reaped
,
passed
by
,
and
he
remarked
,
 
"
Yon
's
frough
Gimmerton
,
nah
!
<EOS>
They
're
allas
three
wick
"
after
other
folk
wi
'
ther
harvest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gimmerton
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
 
my
residence
in
that
locality
had
already
grown
dim
and
dreamy
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
know
.
<EOS>
How
far
is
it
from
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Happen
fourteen
mile
o'er
th
'
 
hills
;
and
a
rough
road
,
"
he
answered
.
  
<EOS>
A
sudden
impulse
seized
me
to
visit
Thrushcross
Grange
.
<EOS>
It
was
scarcely
noon
,
and
I
conceived
that
I
might
as
well
pass
the
night
under
my
own
roof
as
in
an
inn
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
could
spare
a
day
easily
to
arrange
matters
with
my
landlord
,
and
thus
save
myself
the
trouble
of
invading
the
neighbourhood
again
.
<EOS>
Having
rested
awhile
,
I
directed
my
servant
to
inquire
the
way
to
the
village
;
and
,
with
great
fatigue
to
our
beasts
,
we
managed
the
distance
in
some
three
hours
.
  
<EOS>
I
left
him
there
,
and
proceeded
down
the
valley
alone
.
<EOS>
The
grey
church
looked
greyer
,
and
the
lonely
churchyard
lonelier
.
<EOS>
I
distinguished
a
moor
-
sheep
cropping
the
short
turf
on
the
graves
.
<EOS>
It
was
sweet
,
warm
weather
 
too
warm
for
travelling
;
but
the
heat
did
not
hinder
me
from
enjoying
the
delightful
scenery
above
and
below
:
had
I
seen
it
nearer
August
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
it
would
have
tempted
me
to
waste
a
month
among
its
solitudes
.
<EOS>
In
winter
nothing
more
dreary
,
in
summer
nothing
more
divine
,
than
those
glens
shut
in
by
hills
,
and
those
bluff
,
bold
swells
of
heath
.
  
<EOS>
I
reached
the
Grange
before
sunset
,
and
knocked
for
admittance
;
but
the
family
had
retreated
into
the
back
premises
,
I
judged
,
by
one
thin
,
blue
wreath
,
curling
from
the
kitchen
chimney
,
and
they
did
not
hear
.
<EOS>
I
rode
into
the
court
.
<EOS>
Under
the
porch
,
a
girl
of
nine
or
ten
sat
knitting
,
and
an
old
woman
reclined
on
the
housesteps
,
smoking
a
meditative
pipe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Mrs.
Dean
within
?
<EOS>
"
I
demanded
of
the
dame
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mistress
Dean
?
<EOS>
Nay
!
"
<EOS>
she
answered
,
"
she
does
n't
bide
here
:
shoo
's
up
at
th
'
Heights
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
the
housekeeper
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
continued
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eea
,
aw
keep
th
'
 
hause
,
"
she
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'm
Mr.
Lockwood
,
the
master
.
<EOS>
Are
there
any
rooms
to
lodge
me
in
,
I
wonder
?
<EOS>
I
wish
to
stay
all
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
T
'
maister
!
<EOS>
"
she
cried
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whet
,
whoiver
knew
yah
wur
coming
?
<EOS>
Yah
sud
ha
'
send
word
.
<EOS>
They
's
nowt
norther
dry
nor
mensful
<EOS>
abaht
t
'
place
<EOS>
:
nowt
there
is
n't
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
threw
down
her
pipe
and
bustled
in
,
the
girl
followed
,
and
I
entered
too
;
soon
perceiving
that
her
report
was
true
,
and
,
moreover
,
that
I
had
almost
upset
her
wits
by
my
unwelcome
apparition
,
I
bade
her
be
composed
.
<EOS>
I
would
go
out
for
a
walk
;
and
,
meantime
she
must
try
to
prepare
a
corner
of
a
sitting
-
room
for
me
to
sup
in
,
and
a
bedroom
to
sleep
in
.
<EOS>
No
sweeping
and
dusting
,
only
good
fire
and
dry
sheets
were
necessary
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
willing
to
do
her
best
;
though
she
thrust
the
hearth
-
brush
into
the
grates
in
mistake
for
the
poker
,
and
malappropriated
several
other
articles
of
her
craft
:
but
I
retired
,
confiding
in
her
energy
for
a
resting
-
place
against
my
return
.
<EOS>
Wuthering
Heights
was
the
goal
of
my
proposed
excursion
.
<EOS>
An
afterthought
brought
me
back
,
when
I
had
quitted
the
court
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
well
at
the
Heights
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
of
the
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eea
,
f'r
owt
ee
knaw
!
"
<EOS>
she
answered
,
skurrying
away
with
a
pan
of
hot
cinders
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
asked
why
Mrs.
Dean
had
deserted
the
Grange
,
but
it
was
impossible
to
delay
her
at
such
a
crisis
,
so
I
turned
away
and
made
my
exit
,
rambling
leisurely
along
,
with
the
glow
of
a
sinking
sun
behind
,
and
the
mild
glory
of
a
rising
moon
in
front
 
one
fading
,
and
the
other
brightening
 
as
I
quitted
the
park
,
and
climbed
the
stony
by
-
road
branching
off
to
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
dwelling
.
<EOS>
Before
I
arrived
in
sight
of
it
,
all
that
remained
of
day
was
a
beamless
amber
light
along
the
west
:
but
I
could
see
every
pebble
on
the
path
,
and
every
blade
of
grass
,
by
that
splendid
moon
.
<EOS>
I
had
neither
to
climb
the
gate
nor
to
knock
 
<EOS>
it
yielded
to
my
hand
.
<EOS>
That
is
an
improvement
,
I
thought
.
<EOS>
And
I
noticed
another
,
by
the
aid
of
my
nostrils
;
a
fragrance
of
stocks
and
wallflowers
wafted
on
the
air
from
amongst
the
homely
fruit
-
trees
.
  
<EOS>
Both
doors
and
lattices
were
open
;
and
yet
,
as
is
usually
the
case
in
a
coal
-
district
,
a
fine
red
fire
illumined
the
chimney
:
the
comfort
which
the
eye
derives
from
it
renders
the
extra
heat
endurable
.
<EOS>
But
the
house
of
Wuthering
Heights
is
so
large
that
the
inmates
have
plenty
of
space
for
withdrawing
out
of
its
influence
;
and
accordingly
what
inmates
there
were
had
stationed
themselves
not
far
from
one
of
the
windows
.
<EOS>
I
could
both
see
them
and
hear
them
talk
before
I
entered
,
and
looked
and
listened
in
consequence
;
being
moved
thereto
by
a
mingled
sense
of
curiosity
and
envy
,
that
grew
as
I
lingered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Con-_trary
_
!
"
said
a
voice
as
sweet
as
a
silver
bell
.
<EOS>
"
That
for
the
third
time
,
you
dunce
!
<EOS>
I
'm
not
going
to
tell
you
again
.
<EOS>
Recollect
,
or
I
'll
pull
your
hair
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Contrary
,
then
,
"
answered
another
,
in
deep
but
softened
tones
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
kiss
me
,
for
minding
so
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
read
it
over
first
correctly
,
without
a
single
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
male
speaker
began
to
read
:
he
was
a
young
man
,
respectably
dressed
and
seated
at
a
table
,
having
a
book
before
him
.
<EOS>
His
handsome
features
glowed
with
pleasure
,
and
his
eyes
kept
impatiently
wandering
from
the
page
to
a
small
white
hand
over
his
shoulder
,
which
recalled
him
by
a
smart
slap
on
the
cheek
,
whenever
its
owner
detected
such
signs
of
inattention
.
<EOS>
Its
owner
stood
behind
;
her
light
,
shining
ringlets
blending
,
at
intervals
,
with
his
brown
looks
,
as
she
bent
to
superintend
his
studies
;
and
her
face
 
<EOS>
it
was
lucky
he
could
not
see
her
face
,
or
he
would
never
have
been
so
steady
.
<EOS>
I
could
;
<EOS>
and
I
bit
my
lip
in
spite
,
at
having
thrown
away
the
chance
I
might
have
had
of
doing
something
besides
staring
at
its
smiting
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
The
task
was
done
,
not
free
from
further
blunders
;
but
the
pupil
claimed
a
reward
,
and
received
at
least
five
kisses
;
which
,
however
,
he
generously
returned
.
<EOS>
Then
they
came
to
the
door
,
and
from
their
conversation
I
judged
they
were
about
to
issue
out
and
have
a
walk
on
the
moors
.
<EOS>
I
supposed
I
should
be
condemned
in
Hareton
Earnshaw
's
heart
,
if
not
by
his
mouth
,
to
the
lowest
pit
in
the
infernal
regions
<EOS>
if
I
showed
my
unfortunate
person
in
his
neighbourhood
then
;
and
feeling
very
mean
and
malignant
,
I
skulked
round
to
seek
refuge
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
There
was
unobstructed
admittance
on
that
side
also
;
and
at
the
door
sat
my
old
friend
Nelly
Dean
,
sewing
and
singing
a
song
;
which
was
often
interrupted
from
within
by
harsh
words
of
scorn
and
intolerance
,
uttered
in
far
from
musical
accents
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
rayther

<EOS>
by
th
'
 
haulf
,

'em

"
said
the
tenant
of
the
kitchen
,
in
answer
to
an
unheard
speech
of
Nelly
's
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
blazing
shame
,
that
I
can
not
oppen

<EOS>
Poor

"
<EOS>
he
added
,
with
a
groan
;
"
he
's
witched
:
I
'm
sartin
on't
.
<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
"
No

<EOS>
or
we
should
be
sitting
in
flaming
fagots
,
I
suppose
,
"
retorted
the
singer
.
<EOS>
"
But
wisht

old
man
,
and
read
your
Bible
like
a
Christian
,
and
never

<EOS>
This
is
"
Fairy
Annie
's
Wedding
"
 
a
bonny
tune
 
<EOS>
it
goes
to
a
dance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dean
was
about
to
recommence
,
when
I
advanced
;
and
recognising
me
directly
,
she
jumped
to
her
feet
,
crying
 
"
Why
,
bless
you
,
Mr.
Lockwood
!
<EOS>
How
could
you
think
of
returning
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
All
's
shut
up
at
Thrushcross
Grange
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
given
us
notice
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
arranged
to
be
accommodated
there
,
for
as
long
as
I
shall
stay
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
depart
again
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
And
how
are
you
transplanted
here
,
Mrs.
Dean
?
<EOS>
tell
me
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Zillah
left
,
and
Mr.
Heathcliff
wished
me
to
come
,
soon
after
you
went
to
London
,
and
stay
till
you
returned
.
<EOS>
But
,
step
in
,
pray
!
<EOS>
Have
you
walked
from
Gimmerton
this
evening
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
From
the
Grange
,
"
I
replied
;
"
and
while
they
make
me
lodging
room
there
,
I
want
to
finish
my
business
with
your
master
;
because
I
do
n't
think
of
having
another
opportunity
in
a
hurry
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
business
,
sir
?
"
said
Nelly
,
conducting
me
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
gone
out
at
present
,
and
wo
n't
return
soon
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
About
the
rent
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
then
it
is
with
Mrs.
Heathcliff
you
must
settle
,
"
she
observed
;
"
or
rather
with
me
.
<EOS>
She
has
not
learnt
to
manage
her
affairs
yet
,
and
I
act
for
her
<EOS>
:
there
's
nobody
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
looked
surprised
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
have
not
heard
of
Heathcliff
's
death
,
I
see
,
"
she
continued
.
  
<EOS>
"
Heathcliff
dead
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
,
astonished
.
"
How
long
ago
?
"
  
"
Three
months
since
:
but
sit
down
,
and
let
me
take
your
hat
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
Stop
,
you
have
had
nothing
to
eat
,
have
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
nothing
:
I
have
ordered
supper
at
home
.
<EOS>
You
sit
down
too
.
<EOS>
I
never
dreamt
of
his
dying
!
<EOS>
Let
me
hear
how
it
came
to
pass
.
<EOS>
You
say
you
do
n't
expect
them
back
for
some
time
 
the
young
people
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
I
have
to
scold
them
every
evening
for
their
late
rambles
:
but
they
do
n't
care
for
me
.
<EOS>
At
least
,
have
a
drink
of
our
old
ale
;
it
will
do
you
good
:
<EOS>
you
seem
weary
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
hastened
to
fetch
it
before
I
could
refuse
,
and
I
heard
Joseph
asking
whether
"
it
warn't
a
crying
scandal
that
she
should
have
followers
at
her
time
of
life
?
<EOS>
And
then
,
to
get
them
jocks
out
o
'
t
'
maister
's
cellar
!
<EOS>
He
fair
shaamed
to
"
bide
still
and
see
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
stay
to
retaliate
,
but
re
-
entered
in
a
minute
,
bearing
a
reaming
silver
pint
,
whose
contents
I
lauded
with
becoming
earnestness
.
<EOS>
And
afterwards
she
furnished
me
with
the
sequel
of
Heathcliff
's
history
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
"
queer
"
end
,
as
she
expressed
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
summoned
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
within
a
fortnight
of
your
leaving
us
,
she
said
;
and
I
obeyed
joyfully
,
for
Catherine
's
sake
.
<EOS>
My
first
interview
with
her
grieved
and
shocked
me
<EOS>
:
she
had
altered
so
much
since
our
separation
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
did
not
explain
his
reasons
for
taking
a
new
mind
about
my
coming
here
;
he
only
told
me
he
wanted
me
,
and
he
was
tired
of
seeing
Catherine
<EOS>
:
I
must
make
the
little
parlour
my
sitting
-
room
,
and
keep
her
with
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
enough
if
he
were
obliged
to
see
her
once
or
twice
a
day
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
pleased
at
this
arrangement
;
and
,
by
degrees
,
I
smuggled
over
a
great
number
of
books
,
and
other
articles
,
that
had
formed
her
amusement
at
the
Grange
;
and
flattered
myself
we
should
get
on
in
tolerable
comfort
.
<EOS>
The
delusion
did
not
last
long
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
contented
at
first
,
in
a
brief
space
grew
irritable
and
restless
.
<EOS>
For
one
thing
,
she
was
forbidden
to
move
out
of
the
garden
,
and
it
fretted
her
sadly
to
be
confined
to
its
narrow
bounds
as
spring
drew
on
;
for
another
,
in
following
the
house
,
I
was
forced
to
quit
her
frequently
,
and
she
complained
of
loneliness
<EOS>
:
she
preferred
quarrelling
with
Joseph
in
the
kitchen
to
sitting
at
peace
in
her
solitude
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
mind
their
skirmishes
:
but
Hareton
was
often
obliged
to
seek
the
kitchen
also
,
when
the
master
wanted
to
have
the
house
to
himself
!
<EOS>
and
though
in
the
beginning
she
either
left
it
at
his
approach
,
or
quietly
joined
in
my
occupations
,
and
shunned
remarking
or
addressing
him
 
and
though
he
was
always
as
sullen
and
silent
as
possible
 
after
a
while
,
she
changed
her
behaviour
,
and
became
incapable
of
letting
him
alone
:
talking
at
him
;
commenting
on
his
stupidity
and
idleness
;
expressing
her
wonder
how
he
could
endure
the
life
he
lived
 
how
he
could
sit
a
whole
evening
staring
into
the
fire
,
and
dozing
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
just
like
a
dog
,
is
he
not
,
Ellen
?
"
<EOS>
she
once
observed
,
"
or
a
cart
-
horse
?
<EOS>
He
does
his
work
,
eats
his
food
,
and
sleeps
eternally
!
<EOS>
What
a
blank
,
dreary
mind
he
must
have
!
<EOS>
Do
you
ever
dream
,
Hareton
?
<EOS>
And
,
if
you
do
,
what
is
it
about
?
<EOS>
But
you
ca
n't
speak
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
Then
she
looked
at
him
;
but
he
would
neither
open
his
mouth
nor
look
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
,
perhaps
,
dreaming
now
,
"
she
continued
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
twitched
his
shoulder
as
Juno
twitches
hers
.
<EOS>
Ask
him
,
Ellen
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Hareton
will
ask
the
master
to
send
you
up
-
stairs
,
if
you
do
n't
behave
!
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
only
twitched
his
shoulder
but
clenched
his
fist
,
as
if
tempted
to
use
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
why
Hareton
never
speaks
,
when
I
am
in
the
kitchen
,
"
she
exclaimed
,
on
another
occasion
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
afraid
I
shall
laugh
at
him
.
<EOS>
Ellen
,
what
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
He
began
to
teach
himself
to
read
once
;
and
,
because
I
laughed
,
he
burned
his
books
,
and
dropped
it
:
was
he
not
a
fool
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Were
not
you
naughty
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
;
"
answer
me
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
was
,
"
she
went
on
;
"
but
I
did
not
expect
him
to
be
so
silly
.
<EOS>
Hareton
,
if
I
gave
you
a
book
,
would
you
take
it
now
?
<EOS>
I
'll
try
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
placed
one
she
had
been
perusing
on
his
hand
;
he
flung
it
off
,
and
muttered
,
if
she
did
not
give
over
,
he
would
break
her
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
shall
put
it
here
,
"
she
said
,
"
in
the
table
-
drawer
;
and
I
'm
going
to
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
she
whispered
me
to
watch
whether
he
touched
it
,
and
departed
.
<EOS>
But
he
would
not
come
near
it
;
and
so
I
informed
her
in
the
morning
,
to
her
great
disappointment
.
<EOS>
I
saw
she
was
sorry
for
his
persevering
sulkiness
and
indolence
:
her
conscience
reproved
her
for
frightening
him
off
improving
himself
:
she
had
done
it
effectually
.
<EOS>
But
her
ingenuity
was
at
work
to
remedy
the
injury
:
while
I
ironed
,
or
pursued
other
such
stationary
employments
as
I
could
not
well
do
in
the
parlour
,
she
would
bring
some
pleasant
volume
and
read
it
aloud
to
me
.
<EOS>
When
Hareton
was
there
,
she
generally
paused
in
an
interesting
part
,
and
left
the
book
lying
about
:
that
she
did
repeatedly
;
but
he
was
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
,
and
,
instead
of
snatching
at
her
bait
,
in
wet
weather
he
took
to
smoking
with
Joseph
;
and
they
sat
like
automatons
,
one
on
each
side
of
the
fire
,
the
elder
happily
too
deaf
to
understand
her
wicked
nonsense
,
as
he
would
have
called
it
,
the
younger
doing
his
best
to
seem
to
disregard
it
.
<EOS>
On
fine
evenings
the
latter
followed
his
shooting
expeditions
,
and
Catherine
yawned
and
sighed
,
and
teased
me
to
talk
to
her
,
and
ran
off
into
the
court
or
garden
the
moment
I
began
;
and
,
as
a
last
resource
,
cried
,
and
said
she
was
tired
of
living
:
her
life
was
useless
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
who
grew
more
and
more
disinclined
to
society
,
had
almost
banished
Earnshaw
from
his
apartment
.
<EOS>
Owing
to
an
accident
at
the
commencement
of
March
,
he
became
for
some
days
a
fixture
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
His
gun
burst
while
out
on
the
hills
by
himself
;
a
splinter
cut
his
arm
,
and
he
lost
a
good
deal
of
blood
before
he
could
reach
home
.
<EOS>
The
consequence
was
that
,
perforce
,
he
was
condemned
to
the
fireside
and
tranquillity
,
till
he
made
it
up
again
.
<EOS>
It
suited
Catherine
to
have
him
there
:
at
any
rate
,
it
made
her
hate
her
room
up
-
stairs
more
than
ever
:
and
she
would
compel
me
to
find
out
business
below
,
that
she
might
accompany
me
.
  
<EOS>
On
Easter
Monday
,
Joseph
went
to
Gimmerton
fair
with
some
cattle
;
and
,
in
the
afternoon
,
I
was
busy
getting
up
linen
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
Earnshaw
sat
,
morose
as
usual
,
at
the
chimney
corner
,
and
my
little
mistress
was
beguiling
an
idle
hour
with
drawing
pictures
on
the
window
-
panes
,
varying
her
amusement
by
smothered
bursts
of
songs
,
and
whispered
ejaculations
,
and
quick
glances
of
annoyance
and
impatience
in
the
direction
of
her
cousin
,
who
steadfastly
smoked
,
and
looked
into
the
grate
.
<EOS>
At
a
notice
that
I
could
do
with
her
no
longer
intercepting
my
light
,
she
removed
to
the
hearthstone
.
<EOS>
I
bestowed
little
attention
on
her
proceedings
,
but
,
presently
,
I
heard
her
begin
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
found
out
,
Hareton
,
that
I
want
 
that
I
'm
glad
 
that
I
should
like
you
to
be
my
cousin
now
,
if
you
had
not
grown
so
cross
to
me
,
and
so
rough
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hareton
returned
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hareton
,
Hareton
,
Hareton
!
<EOS>
do
you
hear
?
<EOS>
"
she
continued
.
  
<EOS>
"
Get
off
wi
'
ye
!
"
<EOS>
he
growled
,
with
uncompromising
gruffness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
take
that
pipe
,
"
she
said
,
cautiously
advancing
her
hand
and
abstracting
it
from
his
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
Before
he
could
attempt
to
recover
it
,
it
was
broken
,
and
behind
the
fire
.
<EOS>
He
swore
at
her
and
seized
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
<EOS>
,
"
she
cried
,
"
you
must
listen
to
me
first
;
and
I
ca
n't
speak
while
those
clouds
are
floating
in
my
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
go
to
the
devil
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
ferociously
,
"
and
let
me
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
persisted
,
"
I
wo
n't
:
I
ca
n't
tell
what
to
do
to
make
you
talk
to
me
;
and
you
are
determined
not
to
understand
.
<EOS>
When
I
call
you
stupid
,
I
do
n't
mean
anything
:
I
do
n't
mean
that
I
despise
you
.
<EOS>
Come
,
you
shall
take
notice
of
me
,
Hareton
:
you
are
my
cousin
,
and
you
shall
own
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
naught
to
do
wi
'
you
and
your
mucky
pride
,
and
your
damned
mocking
tricks
!
"
<EOS>
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
to
hell
,
body
and
soul
,
before
I
look
sideways
after
you
again
.
<EOS>
Side
out
o
'
t
'
gate
,
now
,
this
minute
!
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
frowned
,
and
retreated
to
the
window
-
seat
chewing
her
lip
,
and
endeavouring
,
by
humming
an
eccentric
tune
,
to
conceal
a
growing
tendency
to
sob
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
be
friends
with
your
cousin
,
Mr.
Hareton
,
"
<EOS>
I
interrupted
,
"
since
she
repents
of
her
sauciness
.
<EOS>
It
would
do
you
a
great
deal
of
good
:
it
would
make
you
another
man
to
have
her
for
a
companion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
companion
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
;
"
when
she
hates
me
,
and
does
not
think
me
fit
to
wipe
her
shoon
!
<EOS>
Nay
,
if
it
made
me
a
king
,
I
'd
not
be
scorned
for
seeking
her
good
-
will
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
I
who
hate
you
,
it
is
you
who
hate
me
!
"
<EOS>
wept
Cathy
,
no
longer
disguising
her
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
You
hate
me
as
much
as
Mr.
Heathcliff
does
,
and
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
damned
liar
,
"
began
Earnshaw
:
"
<EOS>
why
have
I
made
him
angry
,
by
taking
your
part
,
then
,
a
hundred
times
?
<EOS>
and
that
when
you
sneered
at
and
despised
me
,
and
 
Go
on
plaguing
me
,
and
I
'll
step
in
yonder
,
and
say
you
worried
me
out
of
the
kitchen
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
you
took
my
part
,
"
she
answered
,
drying
her
eyes
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
was
miserable
and
bitter
at
everybody
;
but
now
I
thank
you
,
and
beg
you
to
forgive
me
:
what
can
I
do
besides
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
returned
to
the
hearth
,
and
frankly
extended
her
hand
.
<EOS>
He
blackened
and
scowled
like
a
thunder
-
cloud
,
and
kept
his
fists
resolutely
clenched
,
and
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
by
instinct
,
must
have
divined
it
was
obdurate
perversity
,
and
not
dislike
,
that
prompted
this
dogged
conduct
;
for
,
after
remaining
an
instant
undecided
,
she
stooped
and
impressed
on
his
cheek
a
gentle
kiss
.
<EOS>
The
little
rogue
thought
I
had
not
seen
her
,
and
,
drawing
back
<EOS>
,
she
took
her
former
station
by
the
window
,
quite
demurely
.
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
reprovingly
,
and
then
she
blushed
and
whispered
 
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
what
should
I
have
done
,
Ellen
?
<EOS>
He
would
n't
shake
hands
,
and
he
would
n't
look
:
<EOS>
I
must
show
him
some
way
that
I
like
him
 
that
I
want
to
be
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Whether
the
kiss
convinced
Hareton
,
I
can
not
tell
:
<EOS>
he
was
very
careful
,
for
some
minutes
,
that
his
face
should
not
be
seen
,
and
when
he
did
raise
it
,
he
was
sadly
puzzled
where
to
turn
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
employed
herself
in
wrapping
a
handsome
book
neatly
in
white
paper
,
and
having
tied
it
with
a
bit
of
ribbon
,
and
addressed
it
to
"
Mr.
Hareton
Earnshaw
,
"
she
desired
me
to
be
her
ambassadress
,
and
convey
the
present
to
its
destined
recipient
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
tell
him
,
if
he
'll
take
it
,
I
'll
come
and
teach
him
to
read
it
right
,
"
she
said
;
"
and
,
if
he
refuse
it
,
I
'll
go
upstairs
,
and
never
tease
him
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
carried
it
,
and
repeated
the
message
;
anxiously
watched
by
my
employer
.
<EOS>
Hareton
would
not
open
his
fingers
,
so
I
laid
it
on
his
knee
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
strike
it
off
,
either
.
<EOS>
I
returned
to
my
work
.
<EOS>
Catherine
leaned
her
head
and
arms
on
the
table
,
till
she
heard
the
slight
rustle
of
the
covering
being
removed
;
then
she
stole
away
,
and
quietly
seated
herself
beside
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
He
trembled
,
and
his
face
glowed
:
<EOS>
all
his
rudeness
and
all
his
surly
harshness
had
deserted
him
:
<EOS>
he
could
not
summon
courage
,
at
first
,
to
utter
a
syllable
in
reply
to
her
questioning
look
,
and
her
murmured
petition
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
you
forgive
me
,
Hareton
,
do
.
<EOS>
You
can
make
me
so
happy
by
speaking
that
little
word
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
muttered
something
inaudible
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
'll
be
my
friend
?
"
<EOS>
added
Catherine
,
interrogatively
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
you
'll
be
ashamed
of
me
every
day
of
your
life
,
"
he
answered
;
"
and
the
more
ashamed
,
the
more
you
know
me
;
and
I
can
not
bide
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
wo
n't
be
my
friend
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
smiling
as
sweet
as
honey
,
and
creeping
close
up
.
  
<EOS>
I
overheard
no
further
distinguishable
talk
,
but
,
on
looking
round
again
,
I
perceived
two
such
radiant
countenances
bent
over
the
page
of
the
accepted
book
,
that
I
did
not
doubt
the
treaty
had
been
ratified
on
both
sides
;
and
the
enemies
were
,
thenceforth
,
sworn
allies
.
  
<EOS>
The
work
they
studied
was
full
of
costly
pictures
;
and
those
and
their
position
had
charm
enough
to
keep
them
unmoved
till
Joseph
came
home
.
<EOS>
He
,
poor
man
,
was
perfectly
aghast
at
the
spectacle
of
Catherine
seated
on
the
same
bench
with
Hareton
Earnshaw
,
leaning
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
;
and
confounded
at
his
favourite
's
endurance
of
her
proximity
:
it
affected
him
too
deeply
to
allow
an
observation
on
the
subject
that
night
.
<EOS>
His
emotion
was
only
revealed
by
the
immense
sighs
he
drew
,
as
he
solemnly
spread
his
large
Bible
on
the
table
,
and
overlaid
it
with
dirty
bank
-
notes
from
his
pocket
-
book
,
the
produce
of
the
day
's
transactions
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
summoned
Hareton
from
his
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tak
'
these
in
to
t
'
maister
,
lad
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
bide
there
.
<EOS>
I
's
gang
up
to
my
own
rahm
.
<EOS>
This
hoile
's
neither
mensful
nor
seemly
for
us
:
we
mun
side
out
and
seearch
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Catherine
,
"
I
said
,
"
we
must
"
side
out
"
too
:
<EOS>
I
've
done
my
ironing
.
<EOS>
Are
you
ready
to
go
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
eight
o'clock
!
"
<EOS>
she
answered
,
rising
unwillingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hareton
,
I
'll
leave
this
book
upon
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
I
'll
bring
some
more
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ony
books
that
yah
leave
<EOS>
,
I
shall
tak
'
into
th
'
 
hahse
,
"
said
Joseph
,
"
and
it
'll
be
mitch
<EOS>
if
yah
find
'em
agean
;
soa
,
yah
may
plase
yerseln
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Cathy
threatened
that
his
library
should
pay
for
hers
;
and
,
smiling
as
she
passed
Hareton
,
went
singing
up
-
stairs
:
lighter
of
heart
,
I
venture
to
say
,
than
ever
she
had
been
under
that
roof
before
;
except
,
perhaps
,
during
her
earliest
visits
to
Linton
.
  
<EOS>
The
intimacy
thus
commenced
grew
rapidly
;
though
it
encountered
temporary
interruptions
.
<EOS>
Earnshaw
was
not
to
be
civilized
with
a
wish
,
and
my
young
lady
was
no
philosopher
,
and
no
paragon
of
patience
;
but
both
their
minds
tending
to
the
same
point
 
one
loving
and
desiring
to
esteem
,
and
the
other
loving
and
desiring
to
be
esteemed
 
they
contrived
in
the
end
to
reach
it
.
  
<EOS>
You
see
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
it
was
easy
enough
to
win
Mrs.
Heathcliff
's
heart
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
I
'm
glad
you
did
not
try
.
<EOS>
The
crown
of
all
my
wishes
will
be
the
union
of
those
two
.
<EOS>
I
shall
envy
no
one
on
their
wedding
day
:
there
wo
n't
be
a
happier
woman
than
myself
in
England
!
    
<EOS>
On
the
morrow
of
that
Monday
,
Earnshaw
being
still
unable
to
follow
his
ordinary
employments
,
and
therefore
remaining
about
the
house
,
I
speedily
found
it
would
be
impracticable
to
retain
my
charge
beside
me
,
as
heretofore
.
<EOS>
She
got
downstairs
before
me
,
and
out
into
the
garden
,
where
she
had
seen
her
cousin
performing
some
easy
work
;
and
when
I
went
to
bid
them
come
to
breakfast
<EOS>
,
I
saw
she
had
persuaded
him
to
clear
a
large
space
of
ground
from
currant
and
gooseberry
bushes
,
and
they
were
busy
planning
together
an
importation
of
plants
from
the
Grange
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
terrified
at
the
devastation
which
had
been
accomplished
in
a
brief
half
-
hour
;
the
black
-
currant
trees
were
the
apple
of
Joseph
's
eye
,
and
she
had
just
fixed
her
choice
of
a
flower
-
bed
in
the
midst
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
<EOS>
That
will
be
all
shown
to
the
master
,
"
I
exclaimed
,
"
the
minute
it
is
discovered
.
<EOS>
And
what
excuse
have
you
to
offer
for
taking
such
liberties
with
the
garden
?
<EOS>
We
shall
have
a
fine
explosion
on
the
head
of
it
:
see
if
we
do
n't
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Hareton
,
I
wonder
you
should
have
no
more
wit
than
to
go
and
make
that
mess
at
her
bidding
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
forgotten
they
were
Joseph
's
,
"
answered
Earnshaw
,
rather
puzzled
;
"
but
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
him
I
did
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
always
ate
our
meals
with
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
I
held
the
mistress
's
post
in
making
tea
and
carving
;
so
I
was
indispensable
at
table
.
<EOS>
Catherine
usually
sat
by
me
,
but
to
-
day
she
stole
nearer
to
Hareton
;
and
I
presently
saw
she
would
have
no
more
discretion
in
her
friendship
than
she
had
in
her
hostility
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
mind
you
do
n't
talk
with
and
notice
your
cousin
too
much
,
"
were
my
whispered
instructions
as
we
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
certainly
annoy
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
and
he
'll
be
mad
at
you
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
going
to
,
"
she
answered
.
  
<EOS>
The
minute
after
,
she
had
sidled
to
him
,
and
was
sticking
primroses
in
his
plate
of
porridge
.
  
<EOS>
He
dared
not
speak
to
her
there
:
he
dared
hardly
look
;
and
yet
she
went
on
teasing
,
till
he
was
twice
on
the
point
of
being
provoked
to
laugh
.
<EOS>
I
frowned
,
and
then
she
glanced
towards
the
master
:
whose
mind
was
occupied
on
other
subjects
than
his
company
,
as
his
countenance
evinced
;
and
she
grew
serious
for
an
instant
,
scrutinizing
him
with
deep
gravity
.
<EOS>
Afterwards
she
turned
,
and
recommenced
her
nonsense
;
at
last
,
Hareton
uttered
a
smothered
laugh
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
started
;
his
eye
rapidly
surveyed
our
faces
,
Catherine
met
it
with
her
accustomed
look
of
nervousness
and
yet
defiance
,
which
he
abhorred
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
well
you
are
out
of
my
reach
,
"
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
What
fiend
possesses
you
to
stare
back
at
me
,
continually
,
with
those
infernal
eyes
?
<EOS>
Down
with
them
!
<EOS>
and
do
n't
remind
me
of
your
existence
again
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
had
cured
you
of
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
me
,
"
muttered
Hareton
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
?
"
demanded
the
master
.
  
<EOS>
Hareton
looked
at
his
plate
,
and
did
not
repeat
the
confession
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
looked
at
him
a
bit
,
and
then
silently
resumed
his
breakfast
and
his
interrupted
musing
.
<EOS>
We
had
nearly
finished
,
and
the
two
young
people
prudently
shifted
wider
asunder
,
so
I
anticipated
no
further
disturbance
during
that
sitting
:
when
Joseph
appeared
at
the
door
,
revealing
by
his
quivering
lip
and
furious
eyes
that
the
outrage
committed
on
his
precious
shrubs
was
detected
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
seen
Cathy
and
her
cousin
about
the
spot
before
he
examined
it
,
for
while
his
jaws
worked
like
those
of
a
cow
chewing
its
cud
,
and
rendered
his
speech
difficult
to
understand
,
he
began
:
    
"
<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Now

"
interrupted
Heathcliff
,
"
cut
it
short
!
<EOS>
What

<EOS>
I
'll
interfere
in
no

<EOS>
"

Joseph
.
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
He
's
forgotten
all
I
've
done
for
him
,
and
made
on
him
,
and
goan
and
riven
up
a
whole
row
o
'
t
'
<EOS>
grandest
currant
-
trees
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
garden
!
"
<EOS>
and
here
he
lamented
outright
;
unmanned
by
a
sense
of
his
bitter
injuries
,
and
Earnshaw
's
ingratitude
and
dangerous
condition
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
the
fool
drunk
?
"
asked
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
Hareton
,
is
it
you
<EOS>
he
's
finding
fault
with
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
pulled
up
two
or
three
bushes
,
"
replied
the
young
man
;
"
but
I
'm
going
to
set
'em
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
have
you
pulled
them
up
?
"
said
the
master
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
wisely
put
in
her
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
wanted
to
plant
some
flowers
there
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
the
only
person
to
blame
,
for
I
wished
him
to
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
the
devil
gave
_
you
<EOS>
_
leave
to
touch
a
stick
about
the
place
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
her
father
-
in
-
law
,
much
surprised
.
"
<EOS>
And
who
ordered
_
you
_
to
obey
her
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
turning
to
Hareton
.
  
<EOS>
The
latter
was
speechless
;
his
cousin
replied
 
<EOS>
"
You
should
n't
grudge
a
few
yards
of
earth
for
me
to
ornament
,
when
you
have
taken
all
my
land
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
land
,
insolent
slut
!
<EOS>
You
never
had
any
,
"
said
Heathcliff
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
my
money
<EOS>
,
"
she
continued
;
returning
his
angry
glare
,
and
meantime
biting
a
piece
of
crust
,
the
remnant
of
her
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
"
Silence
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
"
Get
done
,
and
begone
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
Hareton
's
land
,
and
his
money
,
"
pursued
the
reckless
thing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hareton
and
I
are
friends
now
;
and
I
shall
tell
him
all
about
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
master
seemed
confounded
a
moment
:
he
grew
pale
,
and
rose
up
,
eyeing
her
all
the
while
,
with
an
expression
of
mortal
hate
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
strike
me
,
Hareton
will
strike
you
,
"
she
said
;
"
so
you
may
as
well
sit
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
Hareton
does
not
turn
you
out
of
the
room
,
I
'll
strike
him
to
hell
,
"
thundered
Heathcliff
.
"
<EOS>
Damnable
witch
!
<EOS>
dare
you
pretend
to
rouse
him
against
me
?
<EOS>
Off
with
her
!
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
?
<EOS>
Fling
her
into
the
kitchen
!
<EOS>
I
'll
kill
her
,
Ellen
Dean
,
if
you
let
her
come
into
my
sight
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
Hareton
tried
,
under
his
breath
,
to
persuade
her
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
Drag
her
away
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
savagely
.
"
<EOS>
Are
you
staying
to
talk
?
"
<EOS>
And
he
approached
to
execute
his
own
command
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
not
obey
you
,
wicked
man
,
any
more
,
"
said
Catherine
;
"
and
he
'll
soon
detest
you
as
much
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wisht
!
wisht
!
<EOS>
"
muttered
the
young
man
,
reproachfully
;
"
I
will
not
hear
you
speak
so
to
him
.
<EOS>
Have
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
wo
n't
let
him
strike
me
?
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
then
,
"
he
whispered
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
too
late
:
Heathcliff
had
caught
hold
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
_
you
_
go
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
Earnshaw
.
"
<EOS>
Accursed
witch
!
<EOS>
this
time
she
has
provoked
me
when
I
could
not
bear
it
;
and
I
'll
make
her
repent
it
for
ever
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
his
hand
in
her
hair
;
Hareton
attempted
to
release
her
locks
,
entreating
him
not
to
hurt
her
that
once
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
's
black
eyes
flashed
;
he
seemed
ready
to
tear
Catherine
in
pieces
,
and
I
was
just
worked
up
to
risk
coming
to
the
rescue
,
when
of
a
sudden
his
fingers
relaxed
;
he
shifted
his
grasp
from
her
head
to
her
arm
,
and
gazed
intently
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
Then
he
drew
his
hand
over
his
eyes
,
stood
a
moment
to
collect
himself
apparently
,
and
turning
anew
to
Catherine
,
said
,
with
assumed
calmness
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
learn
to
avoid
putting
me
in
a
passion
,
or
I
shall
really
murder
you
some
time
!
<EOS>
Go
with
Mrs.
Dean
,
and
keep
with
her
;
and
confine
your
insolence
to
her
ears
.
<EOS>
As
to
Hareton
Earnshaw
,
if
I
see
him
listen
to
you
,
I
'll
send
him
seeking
his
bread
where
he
can
get
it
!
<EOS>
Your
love
will
make
him
an
outcast
and
a
beggar
.
<EOS>
Nelly
,
take
her
;
and
leave
me
,
all
of
you
!
<EOS>
Leave
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
led
my
young
lady
out
:
<EOS>
she
was
too
glad
of
her
escape
to
resist
;
the
other
followed
,
and
Mr.
Heathcliff
had
the
room
to
himself
till
dinner
.
<EOS>
I
had
counselled
Catherine
to
dine
up
-
stairs
;
but
,
as
soon
as
he
perceived
her
vacant
seat
,
he
sent
me
to
call
her
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
to
none
of
us
,
ate
very
little
,
and
went
out
directly
afterwards
,
intimating
that
he
should
not
return
before
evening
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
new
friends
established
themselves
in
the
house
during
his
absence
;
where
I
heard
Hareton
sternly
check
his
cousin
,
on
her
offering
a
revelation
of
her
father
-
in
-
law
's
conduct
to
his
father
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
would
n't
suffer
a
word
to
be
uttered
in
his
disparagement
:
if
he
were
the
devil
,
it
did
n't
signify
;
he
would
stand
by
him
;
and
he
'd
rather
she
would
abuse
himself
,
as
she
used
to
,
than
begin
on
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
Catherine
was
waxing
cross
at
this
;
but
he
found
means
to
make
her
hold
her
tongue
,
by
asking
how
she
would
like
_
him
_
to
speak
ill
of
her
father
?
<EOS>
Then
she
comprehended
that
Earnshaw
took
the
master
's
reputation
home
to
himself
;
and
was
attached
by
ties
stronger
than
reason
could
break
 
chains
,
forged
by
habit
,
which
it
would
be
cruel
to
attempt
to
loosen
.
<EOS>
She
showed
a
good
heart
,
thenceforth
,
in
avoiding
both
complaints
and
expressions
of
antipathy
concerning
Heathcliff
;
and
confessed
to
me
her
sorrow
that
she
had
endeavoured
to
raise
a
bad
spirit
between
him
and
Hareton
:
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
do
n't
believe
she
has
ever
breathed
a
syllable
,
in
the
latter
's
hearing
,
against
her
oppressor
since
.
  
<EOS>
When
this
slight
disagreement
was
over
,
they
were
friends
again
,
and
as
busy
as
possible
in
their
several
occupations
of
pupil
and
teacher
.
<EOS>
I
came
in
to
sit
with
them
,
after
I
had
done
my
work
;
and
I
felt
so
soothed
and
comforted
to
watch
them
,
<EOS>
that
I
did
not
notice
how
time
got
on
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
they
both
appeared
in
a
measure
my
children
<EOS>
:
I
had
long
been
proud
of
one
;
and
now
,
I
was
sure
,
the
other
would
be
a
source
of
equal
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
His
honest
,
warm
,
and
intelligent
nature
shook
off
rapidly
the
clouds
of
ignorance
and
degradation
in
which
it
had
been
bred
;
and
Catherine
's
sincere
commendations
acted
as
a
spur
to
his
industry
.
<EOS>
His
brightening
mind
brightened
his
features
,
and
added
spirit
and
nobility
to
their
aspect
:
I
could
hardly
fancy
it
<EOS>
the
same
individual
<EOS>
I
had
beheld
on
the
day
I
discovered
my
little
lady
at
Wuthering
Heights
,
after
her
expedition
to
the
Crags
.
<EOS>
While
I
admired
and
they
laboured
,
dusk
drew
on
,
and
with
it
returned
the
master
.
<EOS>
He
came
upon
us
quite
unexpectedly
,
entering
by
the
front
way
,
and
had
a
full
view
of
the
whole
three
,
ere
we
could
raise
our
heads
to
glance
at
him
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
reflected
,
there
was
never
a
pleasanter
,
or
more
harmless
sight
;
and
it
will
be
a
burning
shame
to
scold
them
.
<EOS>
The
red
fire
-
light
glowed
on
their
two
bonny
heads
,
and
revealed
their
faces
animated
with
the
eager
interest
of
children
;
for
,
though
he
was
twenty
-
three
and
she
eighteen
,
each
had
so
much
of
novelty
to
feel
and
learn
,
that
neither
experienced
nor
evinced
the
sentiments
of
sober
disenchanted
maturity
.
  
<EOS>
They
lifted
their
eyes
together
,
to
encounter
Mr.
Heathcliff
<EOS>
:
perhaps
you
have
never
remarked
that
their
eyes
are
precisely
similar
,
and
they
are
those
of
Catherine
Earnshaw
.
<EOS>
The
present
Catherine
has
no
other
likeness
to
her
,
except
a
breadth
of
forehead
,
and
a
certain
arch
of
the
nostril
that
makes
her
appear
rather
haughty
,
whether
she
will
or
not
.
<EOS>
With
Hareton
the
resemblance
is
carried
farther
:
it
is
singular
at
all
times
,
_
then
_
it
was
particularly
striking
;
because
his
senses
were
alert
,
and
his
mental
faculties
wakened
to
unwonted
activity
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
this
resemblance
disarmed
Mr.
Heathcliff
:
he
walked
to
the
hearth
in
evident
agitation
;
but
it
quickly
subsided
as
he
looked
at
the
young
man
:
or
,
I
should
say
,
altered
its
character
;
for
it
was
there
yet
.
<EOS>
He
took
the
book
from
his
hand
,
and
glanced
at
the
open
page
,
then
returned
it
without
any
observation
;
merely
signing
Catherine
away
:
her
companion
lingered
very
little
behind
her
,
and
I
was
about
to
depart
also
,
but
he
bid
me
sit
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
poor
conclusion
,
is
it
not
?
"
<EOS>
he
observed
,
having
brooded
awhile
on
the
scene
he
had
just
witnessed
:
"
an
absurd
termination
to
my
violent
exertions
?
<EOS>
I
get
levers
and
mattocks
to
demolish
the
two
houses
,
and
train
myself
to
be
capable
of
working
like
Hercules
,
and
when
everything
is
ready
and
in
my
power
,
I
find
the
will
to
lift
a
slate
off
either
roof
has
vanished
!
<EOS>
My
old
enemies
have
not
beaten
me
;
now
would
be
the
precise
time
to
revenge
myself
on
their
representatives
:
I
could
do
it
;
and
none
could
hinder
me
.
<EOS>
But
where
is
the
use
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
for
striking
<EOS>
:
I
ca
n't
take
the
trouble
to
raise
my
hand
!
<EOS>
That
sounds
as
if
I
had
been
labouring
the
whole
time
only
to
exhibit
a
fine
trait
of
magnanimity
.
<EOS>
It
is
far
from
being
the
case
:
I
have
lost
the
faculty
of
enjoying
their
destruction
,
and
I
am
too
idle
to
destroy
for
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nelly
,
there
is
a
strange
change
approaching
;
I
'm
in
its
shadow
at
present
.
<EOS>
I
take
so
little
interest
in
my
daily
life
that
I
hardly
remember
to
eat
and
drink
.
<EOS>
Those
two
who
have
left
the
room
are
the
only
objects
which
retain
a
distinct
material
appearance
to
me
;
and
that
appearance
causes
me
pain
,
amounting
to
agony
.
<EOS>
About
_
<EOS>
her
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
speak
;
and
I
do
n't
desire
to
think
;
but
I
earnestly
wish
she
were
invisible
:
her
presence
invokes
only
maddening
sensations
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
moves
me
differently
:
<EOS>
and
yet
if
I
could
do
it
without
seeming
insane
,
I
'd
never
see
him
again
!
<EOS>
You
'll
perhaps
think
me
rather
inclined
to
become
so
,
"
he
added
,
making
an
effort
to
smile
,
"
if
I
try
to
describe
the
thousand
forms
of
past
associations
and
ideas
he
awakens
or
embodies
.
<EOS>
But
you
'll
not
talk
of
what
I
tell
you
;
and
my
mind
is
so
eternally
secluded
in
itself
,
it
is
tempting
at
last
to
turn
it
out
to
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
Five
minutes
ago
Hareton
seemed
a
personification
of
my
youth
,
not
a
human
being
;
I
felt
to
him
in
such
a
variety
of
ways
,
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
have
accosted
him
rationally
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
his
startling
likeness
to
Catherine
connected
him
fearfully
with
her
.
<EOS>
That
,
however
,
which
you
may
suppose
the
most
potent
to
arrest
my
imagination
,
is
actually
the
least
:
for
what
is
not
connected
with
her
to
me
?
<EOS>
and
what
does
not
recall
her
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
look
down
to
this
floor
,
but
her
features
are
shaped
in
the
flags
!
<EOS>
In
every
cloud
,
in
every
tree
 
filling
the
air
at
night
,
and
caught
by
glimpses
in
every
object
by
day
 
I
am
surrounded
with
her
image
!
<EOS>
The
most
ordinary
faces
of
men
and
women
 
my
own
features
 
<EOS>
mock
me
with
a
resemblance
.
<EOS>
The
entire
world
is
a
dreadful
collection
of
memoranda
that
she
did
exist
,
and
that
I
have
lost
her
!
<EOS>
Well
,
Hareton
's
aspect
was
the
ghost
of
my
immortal
love
;
of
my
wild
endeavours
to
hold
my
right
;
my
degradation
,
my
pride
,
my
happiness
,
and
my
anguish
    
"
<EOS>
But
it
is
frenzy
to
repeat
these
thoughts
to
you
:
only
it
will
let
you
know
why
,
with
a
reluctance
to
be
always
alone
,
his
society
is
no
benefit
;
rather
an
aggravation
of
the
constant
torment
I
suffer
:
and
it
partly
contributes
to
render
me
regardless
how
he
and
his
cousin
go
on
together
.
<EOS>
I
can
give
them
no
attention
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
do
you
mean
by
a
_
change
_
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
alarmed
at
his
manner
:
though
he
was
neither
in
danger
of
losing
his
senses
,
nor
dying
,
according
to
my
judgment
:
he
was
quite
strong
and
healthy
;
and
,
as
to
his
reason
,
from
childhood
he
had
a
delight
in
dwelling
on
dark
things
,
and
entertaining
odd
fancies
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
had
a
monomania
on
the
subject
of
his
departed
idol
;
but
on
every
other
point
his
wits
were
as
sound
as
mine
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
know
that
till
it
comes
,
"
he
said
;
"
I
'm
only
half
conscious
of
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
feeling
of
illness
,
have
you
?
"
<EOS>
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Nelly
,
I
have
not
,
"
he
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
not
afraid
of
death
?
<EOS>
"
I
pursued
.
  
<EOS>
"
Afraid
?
<EOS>
No
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
neither
a
fear
,
nor
a
presentiment
,
nor
a
hope
of
death
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
?
<EOS>
With
my
hard
constitution
and
temperate
mode
of
living
,
and
unperilous
occupations
,
I
ought
to
,
and
probably
_
shall
_
,
remain
above
ground
till
there
is
scarcely
a
black
hair
on
my
head
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
can
not
continue
in
this
condition
!
<EOS>
I
have
to
remind
myself
to
breathe
 
almost
to
remind
my
heart
to
beat
!
<EOS>
And
it
is
like
bending
back
a
stiff
spring
<EOS>
:
it
is
by
compulsion
that
I
do
the
slightest
act
not
prompted
by
one
thought
;
and
by
compulsion
that
I
notice
anything
alive
or
dead
,
which
is
not
associated
with
one
universal
idea
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
single
wish
,
and
my
whole
being
and
faculties
are
yearning
to
attain
it
.
<EOS>
They
have
yearned
towards
it
so
long
,
and
so
unwaveringly
,
that
I
'm
convinced
it
will
be
reached
 
and
soon
 
because
it
has
devoured
my
existence
:
I
am
swallowed
up
in
the
anticipation
of
its
fulfilment
.
<EOS>
My
confessions
have
not
relieved
me
;
but
they
may
account
for
some
otherwise
unaccountable
phases
of
humour
which
I
show
.
<EOS>
O
God
!
<EOS>
It
is
a
long
fight
;
I
wish
it
were
over
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
began
to
pace
the
room
,
muttering
terrible
things
to
himself
,
till
I
was
inclined
to
believe
,
as
he
said
Joseph
did
,
that
conscience
had
turned
his
heart
to
an
earthly
hell
.
<EOS>
I
wondered
greatly
how
it
would
end
.
<EOS>
Though
he
seldom
before
had
revealed
this
state
of
mind
,
even
by
looks
,
it
was
his
habitual
mood
,
I
had
no
doubt
:
he
asserted
it
himself
;
but
not
a
soul
,
from
his
general
bearing
,
would
have
conjectured
the
fact
.
<EOS>
You
did
not
when
you
saw
him
,
Mr.
Lockwood
:
<EOS>
and
at
the
period
of
which
I
speak
,
he
was
just
the
same
as
then
;
only
fonder
of
continued
solitude
,
and
perhaps
still
more
laconic
in
company
.
    
<EOS>
For
some
days
after
that
evening
Mr.
Heathcliff
shunned
meeting
us
at
meals
;
yet
he
would
not
consent
formally
to
exclude
Hareton
and
Cathy
.
<EOS>
He
had
an
aversion
to
yielding
so
completely
to
his
feelings
,
choosing
rather
to
absent
himself
;
and
eating
once
in
twenty
-
four
hours
seemed
sufficient
sustenance
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
One
night
,
after
the
family
were
in
bed
,
I
heard
him
go
downstairs
,
and
out
at
the
front
door
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
hear
him
re
-
enter
,
and
in
the
morning
I
found
he
was
still
away
.
<EOS>
We
were
in
April
then
:
the
weather
was
sweet
and
warm
,
the
grass
as
green
as
showers
and
sun
could
make
it
,
and
the
two
dwarf
apple
-
trees
near
the
southern
wall
in
full
bloom
.
<EOS>
After
breakfast
,
Catherine
insisted
on
my
bringing
a
chair
and
sitting
with
my
work
under
the
fir
-
trees
at
the
end
of
the
house
;
and
she
beguiled
Hareton
,
who
had
perfectly
recovered
from
his
accident
,
to
dig
and
arrange
her
little
garden
,
which
was
shifted
to
that
corner
by
the
influence
of
Joseph
's
complaints
.
<EOS>
I
was
comfortably
revelling
in
the
spring
fragrance
around
,
and
the
beautiful
soft
blue
overhead
,
when
my
young
lady
,
who
had
run
down
near
the
gate
to
procure
some
primrose
roots
for
a
border
,
returned
only
half
laden
,
and
informed
us
that
Mr.
Heathcliff
was
coming
in
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
spoke
to
me
,
<EOS>
"
she
added
,
with
a
perplexed
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
say
?
"
asked
Hareton
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
told
me
to
begone
as
fast
as
I
could
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
looked
so
different
from
his
usual
look
that
I
stopped
a
moment
to
stare
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
he
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
almost
bright
and
cheerful
.
<EOS>
No
,
_
<EOS>
almost
_
<EOS>
nothing
 
<EOS>
_
very
much
<EOS>
_
excited
,
and
wild
,
and
glad
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Night
-
walking
amuses
him
,
then
,
"
I
remarked
,
affecting
a
careless
manner
:
in
reality
as
surprised
as
she
was
,
and
anxious
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
her
statement
;
for
to
see
the
master
looking
glad
would
not
be
an
every
-
day
spectacle
.
<EOS>
I
framed
an
excuse
to
go
in
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
stood
at
the
open
door
;
he
was
pale
,
and
he
trembled
:
<EOS>
yet
,
certainly
,
he
had
a
strange
joyful
glitter
in
his
eyes
,
that
altered
the
aspect
of
his
whole
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
have
some
breakfast
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
hungry
,
rambling
about
all
night
!
<EOS>
"
I
wanted
to
discover
where
he
had
been
,
but
I
did
not
like
to
ask
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
'm
not
hungry
,
"
he
answered
,
averting
his
head
,
and
speaking
rather
contemptuously
,
as
if
he
guessed
I
was
trying
to
divine
the
occasion
of
his
good
humour
.
  
<EOS>
I
felt
perplexed
:
I
did
n't
know
whether
it
were
not
a
proper
opportunity
to
offer
a
bit
of
admonition
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
it
right
to
wander
out
of
doors
,
"
I
observed
,
"
instead
of
being
in
bed
:
it
is
not
wise
,
at
any
rate
this
moist
season
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
you
'll
catch
a
bad
cold
or
a
fever
:
you
have
something
the
matter
with
you
now
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
but
what
I
can
bear
,
"
he
replied
;
"
and
with
the
greatest
pleasure
,
provided
you
'll
leave
me
alone
:
get
in
,
and
do
n't
annoy
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
obeyed
:
and
,
in
passing
,
I
noticed
he
breathed
as
fast
as
a
cat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
<EOS>
"
I
reflected
to
myself
,
"
we
shall
have
a
fit
of
illness
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
conceive
what
he
has
been
doing
.
"
  
<EOS>
That
noon
he
sat
down
to
dinner
with
us
,
and
received
a
heaped
-
up
plate
from
my
hands
,
as
if
he
intended
to
make
amends
for
previous
fasting
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
neither
cold
nor
fever
,
Nelly
,
"
he
remarked
,
in
allusion
to
my
morning
's
speech
;
"
and
I
'm
ready
to
do
justice
to
the
food
you
give
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
was
going
to
commence
eating
,
when
the
inclination
appeared
to
become
suddenly
extinct
.
<EOS>
He
laid
them
on
the
table
,
looked
eagerly
towards
the
window
,
then
rose
and
went
out
.
<EOS>
We
saw
him
walking
to
and
fro
in
the
garden
while
we
concluded
our
meal
,
and
Earnshaw
said
he
'd
go
and
ask
why
he
would
not
dine
<EOS>
:
he
thought
we
had
grieved
him
some
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
is
he
coming
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Catherine
,
when
her
cousin
returned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
he
answered
;
"
but
he
's
not
angry
:
he
seemed
rarely
pleased
indeed
;
only
I
made
him
impatient
by
speaking
to
him
twice
;
and
then
he
bid
me
be
off
to
you
:
<EOS>
he
wondered
how
I
could
want
the
company
of
anybody
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
set
his
plate
to
keep
warm
on
the
fender
;
and
after
an
hour
or
two
he
re
-
entered
,
when
the
room
was
clear
,
in
no
degree
calmer
:
<EOS>
the
same
unnatural
 
<EOS>
it
was
unnatural
 
appearance
of
joy
under
his
black
brows
;
the
same
bloodless
hue
,
and
his
teeth
visible
,
now
and
then
,
in
a
kind
of
smile
;
his
frame
shivering
,
not
as
one
shivers
with
chill
or
weakness
,
but
as
a
tight
-
stretched
cord
vibrates
 
a
strong
thrilling
,
rather
than
trembling
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
ask
what
is
the
matter
,
I
thought
;
or
who
should
?
<EOS>
And
I
exclaimed
 
"
Have
you
heard
any
good
news
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
?
<EOS>
You
look
uncommonly
animated
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
should
good
news
come
from
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
animated
with
hunger
;
and
,
seemingly
,
I
must
not
eat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
dinner
is
here
,
"
I
returned
;
"
why
wo
n't
you
get
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
it
now
,
"
he
muttered
,
hastily
:
"
I
'll
wait
till
supper
.
<EOS>
And
,
Nelly
,
once
for
all
,
let
me
beg
you
to
warn
Hareton
and
the
other
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
be
troubled
by
nobody
:
I
wish
to
have
this
place
to
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
some
new
reason
for
this
banishment
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
why
you
are
so
queer
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
?
<EOS>
Where
were
you
last
night
?
<EOS>
I
'm
not
putting
the
question
through
idle
curiosity
,
but
 
"
  
"
You
are
putting
the
question
through
very
idle
curiosity
,
"
he
interrupted
,
with
a
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
Yet
I
'll
answer
it
.
<EOS>
Last
night
I
was
on
the
threshold
of
hell
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
,
I
am
within
sight
of
my
heaven
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
eyes
on
it
:
hardly
three
feet
to
sever
me
!
<EOS>
And
now
you
'd
better
go
!
<EOS>
You
'll
neither
see
nor
hear
anything
to
frighten
you
,
if
you
refrain
from
prying
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Having
swept
the
hearth
and
wiped
the
table
,
I
departed
;
more
perplexed
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
quit
the
house
again
that
afternoon
,
and
no
one
intruded
on
his
solitude
;
till
,
at
eight
o'clock
,
I
deemed
it
proper
,
though
unsummoned
,
to
carry
a
candle
and
his
supper
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
leaning
against
the
ledge
of
an
open
lattice
,
but
not
looking
out
:
his
face
was
turned
to
the
interior
gloom
.
<EOS>
The
fire
had
smouldered
to
ashes
;
the
room
was
filled
with
the
damp
,
mild
air
of
the
cloudy
evening
;
and
so
still
,
that
not
only
the
murmur
of
the
beck
down
Gimmerton
was
distinguishable
,
but
its
ripples
and
its
gurgling
over
the
pebbles
,
or
through
the
large
stones
which
it
could
not
cover
.
<EOS>
I
uttered
an
ejaculation
of
discontent
at
seeing
the
dismal
grate
,
and
commenced
shutting
the
casements
,
one
after
another
,
till
I
came
to
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
Must
I
close
this
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
in
order
to
rouse
him
;
for
he
would
not
stir
.
  
<EOS>
The
light
flashed
on
his
features
as
I
spoke
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
I
can
not
express
what
a
terrible
start
<EOS>
I
got
by
the
momentary
view
!
<EOS>
Those
deep
black
eyes
!
<EOS>
That
smile
,
and
ghastly
paleness
!
<EOS>
It
appeared
to
me
,
not
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
but
a
goblin
;
and
,
in
my
terror
,
I
let
the
candle
bend
towards
the
wall
,
and
it
left
me
in
darkness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
close
it
,
"
he
replied
,
in
his
familiar
voice
.
<EOS>
"
There
,
that
is
pure
awkwardness
!
<EOS>
Why
did
you
hold
the
candle
horizontally
?
<EOS>
Be
quick
,
and
bring
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hurried
out
in
a
foolish
state
of
dread
,
and
said
to
Joseph
 
"
The
master
wishes
you
to
take
him
a
light
and
rekindle
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
For
I
dared
not
go
in
myself
again
just
then
.
  
<EOS>
Joseph
rattled
some
fire
into
the
shovel
,
and
went
:
but
he
brought
it
back
immediately
,
with
the
supper
-
tray
in
his
other
hand
,
explaining
that
Mr.
Heathcliff
was
going
to
bed
,
and
he
wanted
nothing
to
eat
till
morning
.
<EOS>
We
heard
him
mount
the
stairs
directly
;
he
did
not
proceed
to
his
ordinary
chamber
,
but
turned
into
that
with
the
panelled
bed
:
its
window
,
as
I
mentioned
before
,
is
wide
enough
for
anybody
to
get
through
;
and
it
struck
me
that
he
plotted
another
midnight
excursion
,
of
which
he
had
<EOS>
rather
we
had
no
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
a
ghoul
or
a
vampire
?
<EOS>
"
I
mused
.
<EOS>
I
had
read
of
such
hideous
incarnate
demons
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
set
myself
to
reflect
how
I
had
tended
him
in
infancy
,
and
watched
him
grow
to
youth
,
and
followed
him
almost
through
his
whole
course
;
and
what
absurd
nonsense
it
was
to
yield
to
that
sense
of
horror
.
<EOS>
"
But
where
did
he
come
from
,
the
little
dark
thing
,
harboured
by
a
good
man
to
his
bane
?
"
<EOS>
muttered
Superstition
,
as
I
dozed
into
unconsciousness
.
<EOS>
And
I
began
,
half
dreaming
,
to
weary
myself
with
imagining
some
fit
parentage
for
him
;
and
,
repeating
my
waking
meditations
,
I
tracked
his
existence
over
again
,
with
grim
variations
;
at
last
,
picturing
his
death
and
funeral
:
of
which
,
all
I
can
remember
is
,
being
exceedingly
vexed
at
having
the
task
of
dictating
an
inscription
for
his
monument
,
and
consulting
the
sexton
about
it
;
and
,
as
he
had
no
surname
,
and
we
could
not
tell
his
age
,
we
were
obliged
to
content
ourselves
with
the
single
word
,
"
Heathcliff
.
"
<EOS>
That
came
true
:
we
were
.
<EOS>
If
you
enter
the
kirkyard
,
you
'll
read
,
on
his
headstone
,
only
that
,
and
the
date
of
his
death
.
  
<EOS>
Dawn
restored
me
to
common
sense
.
<EOS>
I
rose
,
and
went
into
the
garden
,
as
soon
as
I
could
see
,
to
ascertain
if
there
were
any
footmarks
under
his
window
.
<EOS>
There
were
none
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
stayed
at
home
,
"
I
thought
,
"
and
he
'll
be
all
right
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
I
prepared
breakfast
for
the
household
,
as
was
my
usual
custom
,
but
told
Hareton
and
Catherine
to
get
theirs
ere
<EOS>
the
master
came
down
,
for
he
lay
late
.
<EOS>
They
preferred
taking
it
out
of
doors
,
under
the
trees
,
and
I
set
a
little
table
to
accommodate
them
.
  
<EOS>
On
my
re
-
entrance
,
I
found
Mr.
Heathcliff
below
.
<EOS>
He
and
Joseph
were
conversing
about
some
farming
business
;
he
gave
clear
,
minute
directions
concerning
the
matter
discussed
,
but
he
spoke
rapidly
,
and
turned
his
head
continually
aside
,
and
had
the
same
excited
expression
,
even
more
exaggerated
.
<EOS>
When
Joseph
quitted
the
room
he
took
his
seat
in
the
place
he
generally
chose
,
and
I
put
a
basin
of
coffee
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
drew
it
nearer
,
and
then
rested
his
arms
on
the
table
,
and
looked
at
the
opposite
wall
,
as
I
supposed
,
surveying
one
particular
portion
,
up
and
down
,
with
glittering
,
restless
eyes
,
and
with
such
eager
interest
that
he
stopped
breathing
during
half
a
minute
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
now
,
"
I
exclaimed
,
pushing
some
bread
against
his
hand
,
"
eat
and
drink
that
,
while
it
is
hot
:
it
has
been
waiting
near
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
did
n't
notice
me
,
and
yet
he
smiled
.
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
have
seen
him
gnash
his
teeth
than
smile
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
master
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
,
"
do
n't
,
for
God
's
sake
,
stare
as
if
you
saw
an
unearthly
vision
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
,
for
God
's
sake
,
shout
so
loud
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Turn
round
,
and
tell
me
,
are
we
by
ourselves
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
was
my
answer
;
"
of
course
we
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
Still
,
I
involuntarily
obeyed
him
,
as
if
I
was
not
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
With
a
sweep
of
his
hand
he
cleared
a
vacant
space
in
front
among
the
breakfast
things
,
and
leant
forward
to
gaze
more
at
his
ease
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
I
perceived
he
was
not
looking
at
the
wall
;
for
when
I
regarded
him
alone
,
it
seemed
exactly
that
he
gazed
at
something
within
two
yards
'
distance
.
<EOS>
And
whatever
it
was
,
it
communicated
,
apparently
,
both
pleasure
and
pain
in
exquisite
extremes
:
at
least
the
anguished
,
yet
raptured
,
expression
of
his
countenance
suggested
that
idea
.
<EOS>
The
fancied
object
was
not
fixed
,
either
:
his
eyes
pursued
it
with
unwearied
diligence
,
and
,
even
in
speaking
to
me
,
were
never
weaned
away
.
<EOS>
I
vainly
reminded
him
of
his
protracted
abstinence
from
food
:
if
he
stirred
to
touch
anything
in
compliance
with
my
entreaties
,
if
he
stretched
his
hand
out
to
get
a
piece
of
bread
,
his
fingers
clenched
before
they
reached
it
,
and
remained
on
the
table
,
forgetful
of
their
aim
.
  
<EOS>
I
sat
,
a
model
of
patience
,
trying
to
attract
his
absorbed
attention
from
its
engrossing
speculation
;
till
he
grew
irritable
,
and
got
up
,
asking
why
I
would
not
allow
him
to
have
his
own
time
in
taking
his
meals
?
and
saying
that
on
the
next
occasion
I
need
n't
wait
:
<EOS>
I
might
set
the
things
down
and
go
.
<EOS>
Having
uttered
these
words
he
left
the
house
,
slowly
sauntered
down
the
garden
path
,
and
disappeared
through
the
gate
.
  
<EOS>
The
hours
crept
anxiously
by
:
another
evening
came
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
retire
to
rest
till
late
,
and
when
I
did
,
I
could
not
sleep
.
<EOS>
He
returned
after
midnight
,
and
,
instead
of
going
to
bed
,
shut
himself
into
the
room
beneath
.
<EOS>
I
listened
,
and
tossed
about
,
and
,
finally
,
dressed
and
descended
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
irksome
to
lie
there
,
harassing
my
brain
with
a
hundred
idle
misgivings
.
  
<EOS>
I
distinguished
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
step
,
restlessly
measuring
the
floor
,
and
he
frequently
broke
the
silence
by
a
deep
inspiration
,
resembling
a
groan
.
<EOS>
He
muttered
detached
words
also
;
the
only
one
I
could
catch
was
the
name
of
Catherine
,
coupled
with
some
wild
term
of
endearment
or
suffering
;
and
spoken
as
one
would
speak
to
a
person
present
;
low
and
earnest
,
and
wrung
from
the
depth
of
his
soul
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
courage
to
walk
straight
into
the
apartment
;
but
I
desired
to
divert
him
from
his
reverie
,
and
therefore
fell
foul
of
the
kitchen
fire
,
stirred
it
,
and
began
to
scrape
the
cinders
.
<EOS>
It
drew
him
forth
sooner
than
I
expected
.
<EOS>
He
opened
the
door
immediately
,
and
said
 
"
Nelly
,
come
here
 
is
it
morning
?
<EOS>
Come
in
with
your
light
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
striking
four
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
You
want
a
candle
to
take
up
-
stairs
:
you
might
have
lit
one
at
this
fire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
n't
wish
to
go
up
-
stairs
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
and
kindle
_
me
_
a
fire
,
and
do
anything
there
is
to
do
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
blow
the
coals
red
first
,
before
I
can
carry
any
,
"
I
replied
,
getting
a
chair
and
the
bellows
.
  
<EOS>
He
roamed
to
and
fro
,
meantime
,
in
a
state
approaching
distraction
;
his
heavy
sighs
succeeding
each
other
so
thick
as
to
leave
no
space
for
common
breathing
between
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
day
breaks
I
'll
send
for
Green
,
"
he
said
;
"
I
wish
to
make
some
legal
inquiries
of
him
while
I
can
bestow
a
thought
on
those
matters
,
and
while
I
can
act
calmly
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
written
my
will
yet
;
and
how
to
leave
my
property
<EOS>
I
can
not
determine
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
annihilate
it
from
the
face
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
talk
so
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
"
I
interposed
.
<EOS>
"
Let
your
will
be
a
while
:
you
'll
be
spared
to
repent
of
your
many
injustices
yet
!
<EOS>
I
never
expected
that
your
nerves
would
be
disordered
:
they
are
,
at
present
,
marvellously
so
,
however
;
and
almost
entirely
through
your
own
fault
.
<EOS>
The
way
you
've
passed
these
three
last
days
might
knock
up
a
Titan
.
<EOS>
Do
take
some
food
,
and
some
repose
.
<EOS>
You
need
only
look
at
yourself
in
a
glass
to
see
how
you
require
both
.
<EOS>
Your
cheeks
are
hollow
,
and
your
eyes
blood
-
shot
,
like
a
person
starving
with
hunger
and
going
blind
with
loss
of
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
my
fault
that
I
can
not
eat
or
rest
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
it
is
through
no
settled
designs
.
<EOS>
I
'll
do
both
,
as
soon
as
I
possibly
can
.
<EOS>
But
you
might
as
well
bid
a
man
struggling
in
the
water
rest
within
arms
'
length
of
the
shore
!
<EOS>
I
must
reach
it
first
,
and
then
I
'll
rest
.
<EOS>
Well
,
never
mind
Mr.
Green
:
as
to
repenting
of
my
injustices
,
I
've
done
no
injustice
,
and
I
repent
of
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
'm
too
happy
;
and
yet
I
'm
not
happy
enough
.
<EOS>
My
soul
's
bliss
kills
my
body
,
but
does
not
satisfy
itself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Happy
,
master
?
"
I
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Strange
happiness
!
<EOS>
If
you
would
hear
me
without
being
angry
,
I
might
offer
some
advice
that
would
make
you
happier
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
"
<EOS>
Give
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
aware
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
"
I
said
,
"
that
from
the
time
you
were
thirteen
years
old
you
have
lived
a
selfish
,
unchristian
life
;
and
probably
hardly
had
a
Bible
in
your
hands
during
all
that
period
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
forgotten
the
contents
of
the
book
,
and
you
may
not
have
space
to
search
it
now
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
hurtful
to
send
for
some
one
 
<EOS>
some
minister
of
any
denomination
<EOS>
,
it
does
not
matter
which
 
to
explain
it
,
and
show
you
how
very
far
you
have
erred
from
its
precepts
;
and
how
unfit
you
will
be
for
its
heaven
,
unless
a
change
takes
place
before
you
die
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
rather
obliged
than
angry
,
Nelly
,
"
he
said
,
"
<EOS>
for
you
remind
me
of
the
manner
in
which
I
desire
to
be
buried
.
<EOS>
It
is
to
be
carried
to
the
churchyard
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
You
and
Hareton
may
,
if
you
please
,
accompany
me
:
and
mind
,
particularly
,
to
notice
that
the
sexton
obeys
my
directions
concerning
the
two
coffins
!
<EOS>
No
minister
need
come
;
nor
need
anything
be
said
over
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
I
have
nearly
attained
_
my
_
heaven
;
and
that
of
others
is
altogether
unvalued
and
uncoveted
by
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
supposing
you
persevered
in
your
obstinate
fast
,
and
died
by
that
means
,
and
they
refused
to
bury
you
in
the
precincts
of
the
kirk
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
shocked
at
his
godless
indifference
.
<EOS>
"
How
would
you
like
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
wo
n't
do
that
,
"
he
replied
:
"
<EOS>
if
they
did
,
you
must
have
me
removed
secretly
;
and
if
you
neglect
it
you
shall
prove
,
practically
,
that
the
dead
are
not
annihilated
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
heard
the
other
members
of
the
family
stirring
he
retired
to
his
den
,
and
I
breathed
freer
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
afternoon
,
while
Joseph
and
Hareton
were
at
their
work
,
he
came
into
the
kitchen
again
,
and
,
with
a
wild
look
,
bid
me
come
and
sit
in
the
house
:
he
wanted
somebody
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
declined
;
telling
him
plainly
that
his
strange
talk
and
manner
frightened
me
,
and
I
had
neither
the
nerve
nor
the
will
to
be
his
companion
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
think
me
a
fiend
,
"
he
said
,
with
his
dismal
laugh
:
"
something
too
horrible
to
live
under
a
decent
roof
.
"
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
Catherine
,
who
was
there
,
and
who
drew
behind
me
at
his
approach
,
he
added
,
half
sneeringly
,
 
"
Will
_
you
_
come
,
chuck
?
<EOS>
I
'll
not
hurt
you
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
to
you
I
've
made
myself
worse
than
the
devil
.
<EOS>
Well
,
there
is
_
one
<EOS>
_
who
wo
n't
shrink
from
my
company
!
<EOS>
By
God
!
<EOS>
she
's
relentless
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
damn
it
!
<EOS>
It
's
unutterably
too
much
for
flesh
and
blood
to
bear
 
even
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
solicited
the
society
of
no
one
more
.
<EOS>
At
dusk
he
went
into
his
chamber
.
<EOS>
Through
the
whole
night
,
and
far
into
the
morning
,
we
heard
him
groaning
and
murmuring
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Hareton
was
anxious
to
enter
;
but
I
bid
him
fetch
Mr.
Kenneth
,
and
he
should
go
in
and
see
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
came
,
and
I
requested
admittance
and
tried
to
open
the
door
,
I
found
it
locked
;
and
Heathcliff
bid
us
be
damned
.
<EOS>
He
was
better
,
and
would
be
left
alone
;
so
the
doctor
went
away
.
  
<EOS>
The
following
evening
was
very
wet
:
indeed
,
it
poured
down
till
day
-
dawn
;
and
,
as
I
took
my
morning
walk
round
the
house
,
I
observed
the
master
's
window
swinging
open
,
and
the
rain
driving
straight
in
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
be
in
bed
,
I
thought
:
those
showers
would
drench
him
through
.
<EOS>
He
must
either
be
up
or
out
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
make
no
more
ado
,
I
'll
go
boldly
and
look
.
"
  
<EOS>
Having
succeeded
in
obtaining
entrance
with
another
key
,
I
ran
to
unclose
the
panels
,
for
the
chamber
was
vacant
;
quickly
pushing
them
aside
,
I
peeped
in
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
was
there
 
laid
on
his
back
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
met
mine
so
keen
and
fierce
,
I
started
;
and
then
he
seemed
to
smile
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
think
him
dead
:
but
his
face
and
throat
were
washed
with
rain
;
the
bed
-
clothes
dripped
,
and
he
was
perfectly
still
.
<EOS>
The
lattice
,
flapping
to
and
fro
,
had
grazed
one
hand
that
rested
on
the
sill
;
no
blood
trickled
from
the
broken
skin
,
and
when
I
put
my
fingers
to
it
,
I
could
doubt
no
more
:
<EOS>
he
was
dead
and
stark
!
  
<EOS>
I
hasped
the
window
;
I
combed
his
black
long
hair
from
his
forehead
;
I
tried
to
close
his
eyes
:
to
extinguish
,
if
possible
,
that
frightful
,
life
-
like
gaze
of
exultation
before
any
one
else
beheld
it
.
<EOS>
They
would
not
shut
:
they
seemed
to
sneer
at
my
attempts
;
and
his
parted
lips
and
sharp
white
teeth
sneered
too
!
<EOS>
Taken
with
another
fit
of
cowardice
,
I
cried
out
for
Joseph
.
<EOS>
Joseph
shuffled
up
and
made
a
noise
,
but
resolutely
refused
to
meddle
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Th
'
divil
's
harried
off
his
soul
,
"
he
cried
,
"
and
<EOS>
he
may
hev
'
his
carcass
into
t
'
bargin
,
for
aught
I
care
!
<EOS>
Ech
!
<EOS>
what
a
wicked
'
un
he
looks
,
girning
at
death
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
old
sinner
grinned
in
mockery
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
intended
to
cut
a
caper
round
the
bed
;
but
suddenly
composing
himself
,
he
fell
on
his
knees
,
and
raised
his
hands
,
and
returned
thanks
that
the
lawful
master
and
the
ancient
stock
were
restored
to
their
rights
.
  
<EOS>
I
felt
stunned
by
the
awful
event
;
and
my
memory
unavoidably
recurred
to
former
times
with
a
sort
of
oppressive
sadness
.
<EOS>
But
poor
Hareton
,
the
most
wronged
,
was
the
only
one
who
really
suffered
much
.
<EOS>
He
sat
by
the
corpse
all
night
,
weeping
in
bitter
earnest
.
<EOS>
He
pressed
its
hand
,
and
kissed
the
sarcastic
,
savage
face
that
every
one
else
shrank
from
contemplating
;
and
bemoaned
him
with
that
strong
grief
which
springs
naturally
from
a
generous
heart
,
though
it
be
tough
as
tempered
steel
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kenneth
was
perplexed
to
pronounce
of
what
disorder
the
master
died
.
<EOS>
I
concealed
the
fact
of
his
having
swallowed
nothing
for
four
days
,
fearing
it
might
lead
to
trouble
,
and
then
,
I
am
persuaded
,
he
did
not
abstain
on
purpose
:
it
was
the
consequence
of
his
strange
illness
,
not
the
cause
.
  
<EOS>
We
buried
him
,
to
the
scandal
of
the
whole
neighbourhood
,
as
he
wished
.
<EOS>
Earnshaw
and
I
,
the
sexton
,
and
six
men
to
carry
the
coffin
,
comprehended
the
whole
attendance
.
<EOS>
The
six
men
departed
when
they
had
let
it
down
into
the
grave
:
we
stayed
to
see
it
covered
.
<EOS>
Hareton
,
with
a
streaming
face
,
dug
green
sods
,
and
laid
them
over
the
brown
mould
himself
:
at
present
it
is
as
smooth
and
verdant
as
its
companion
mounds
 
<EOS>
and
I
hope
its
tenant
sleeps
as
soundly
.
<EOS>
But
the
country
folks
,
if
you
ask
them
,
would
swear
on
the
Bible
that
he
_
walks
_
:
there
are
those
who
speak
to
having
met
him
near
the
church
,
and
on
the
moor
,
and
even
within
this
house
.
<EOS>
Idle
tales
,
you
'll
say
,
and
<EOS>
so
say
I.
<EOS>
Yet
that
old
man
by
the
kitchen
fire
affirms
he
has
seen
two
on
'em
looking
out
of
his
chamber
window
on
every
rainy
night
since
his
death
:
 
and
an
odd
thing
happened
to
me
about
a
month
ago
.
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
the
Grange
one
evening
 
<EOS>
a
dark
evening
,
threatening
thunder
 
and
,
just
at
the
turn
of
the
Heights
,
I
encountered
a
little
boy
with
a
sheep
and
two
lambs
before
him
;
he
was
crying
terribly
;
and
I
supposed
the
lambs
were
skittish
,
and
would
not
be
guided
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
,
my
little
man
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
Heathcliff
and
a
woman
yonder
,
under
t
'
nab
,
"
he
blubbered
,
"
un
'
<EOS>
I
darnut
pass
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
saw
nothing
;
but
neither
the
sheep
nor
he
would
go
on
<EOS>
so
I
bid
him
take
the
road
lower
down
.
<EOS>
He
probably
raised
the
phantoms
from
thinking
,
as
he
traversed
the
moors
alone
,
on
the
nonsense
he
had
heard
his
parents
and
companions
repeat
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
still
,
I
do
n't
like
being
out
in
the
dark
now
;
and
I
do
n't
like
being
left
by
myself
in
this
grim
house
:
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
it
;
I
shall
be
glad
when
they
leave
it
,
and
shift
to
the
Grange
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
going
to
the
Grange
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
answered
Mrs.
Dean
,
"
as
soon
as
they
are
married
,
and
that
will
be
on
New
Year
's
Day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
who
will
live
here
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Joseph
will
take
care
of
the
house
,
and
,
perhaps
,
a
lad
to
keep
him
company
.
<EOS>
They
will
live
in
the
kitchen
,
and
the
rest
will
be
shut
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
the
use
of
such
ghosts
as
choose
to
inhabit
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
observed
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
"
said
Nelly
,
shaking
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
the
dead
are
at
peace
:
but
it
is
not
right
to
speak
of
them
with
levity
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
that
moment
the
garden
gate
swung
to
;
the
ramblers
were
returning
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
They
_
are
afraid
of
nothing
,
"
I
grumbled
,
watching
their
approach
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
Together
,
they
would
brave
Satan
and
all
his
legions
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
they
stepped
on
to
the
door
-
stones
,
and
halted
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
moon
 
or
,
more
correctly
,
at
each
other
by
her
light
 
<EOS>
I
felt
irresistibly
impelled
to
escape
them
again
;
and
,
pressing
a
remembrance
into
the
hand
of
Mrs.
Dean
,
and
disregarding
her
expostulations
at
my
rudeness
,
I
vanished
through
the
kitchen
as
they
opened
the
house
-
door
;
and
so
should
have
confirmed
Joseph
in
his
opinion
of
his
fellow
-
servant
's
gay
indiscretions
,
<EOS>
had
he
not
fortunately
recognised
me
for
a
respectable
character
by
the
sweet
ring
of
a
sovereign
at
his
feet
.
  
<EOS>
My
walk
home
was
lengthened
by
a
diversion
in
the
direction
of
the
kirk
.
<EOS>
When
beneath
its
walls
,
I
perceived
decay
had
made
progress
,
even
in
seven
months
:
many
a
window
showed
black
gaps
deprived
of
glass
;
and
slates
jutted
off
here
and
there
,
beyond
the
right
line
of
the
roof
,
to
be
gradually
worked
off
in
coming
autumn
storms
.
  
<EOS>
I
sought
,
and
soon
discovered
,
the
three
headstones
on
the
slope
next
the
moor
:
the
middle
one
grey
,
and
half
buried
in
the
heath
;
Edgar
Linton
's
only
harmonized
by
the
turf
and
moss
creeping
up
its
foot
;
Heathcliff
's
still
bare
.
  
<EOS>
I
lingered
round
them
,
under
that
benign
sky
:
watched
the
moths
fluttering
among
the
heath
and
harebells
,
listened
to
the
soft
wind
breathing
through
the
grass
,
and
wondered
how
any
one
could
ever
imagine
unquiet
slumbers
for
the
sleepers
in
that
quiet
earth
.
