Dombey
and
Son
 
DOMBEY
sat
in
the
corner
of
the
darkened
room
in
the
great
arm
-
chair
by
the
bedside
,
and
Son
lay
tucked
up
warm
in
a
little
basket
bedstead
,
carefully
disposed
on
a
low
settee
immediately
in
front
of
the
fire
and
close
to
it
,
as
if
his
constitution
were
analogous
to
that
of
a
muffin
,
and
it
was
essential
to
toast
him
brown
while
he
was
very
new
.
  
<EOS>
Dombey
was
about
eight
-
and
-
forty
years
of
age
.
<EOS>
Son
about
eight
-
and
-
forty
minutes
.
<EOS>
Dombey
was
rather
bald
,
rather
red
,
and
though
a
handsome
well
-
made
man
,
too
stern
and
pompous
in
appearance
,
to
be
prepossessing
.
<EOS>
Son
was
very
bald
,
and
very
red
,
and
though
(
of
course
)
an
undeniably
fine
infant
,
somewhat
crushed
and
spotty
in
his
general
effect
,
as
yet
.
<EOS>
On
the
brow
of
Dombey
,
Time
and
his
brother
Care
had
set
some
marks
,
as
on
a
tree
that
was
to
come
down
in
good
time
---
remorseless
twins
they
are
for
striding
through
their
human
forests
,
<EOS>
notching
as
they
go
---
while
the
countenance
of
Son
was
crossed
and
recrossed
with
a
thousand
little
creases
,
which
the
same
deceitful
Time
would
take
delight
in
smoothing
out
and
wearing
away
with
the
flat
part
of
his
scythe
,
as
a
preparation
of
the
surface
for
his
deeper
operations
.
  
<EOS>
Dombey
,
exulting
in
the
long
-
looked
-
for
event
,
jingled
and
jingled
the
heavy
gold
watch
-
chain
that
depended
from
below
his
trim
blue
coat
,
whereof
the
buttons
sparkled
phosphorescently
in
the
feeble
rays
of
the
distant
fire
.
<EOS>
Son
,
with
his
little
fists
curled
up
and
clenched
,
seemed
,
in
his
feeble
way
,
to
be
squaring
at
existence
for
having
come
upon
him
so
unexpectedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
house
will
once
again
,
Mrs
Dombey
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
be
not
only
in
name
but
in
fact
Dombey
and
Son
;
Dom
-
bey
and
Son
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
words
had
such
a
softening
influence
,
that
he
appended
a
term
of
endearment
to
Mrs
Dombey
's
name
(
though
not
without
some
hesitation
,
as
being
a
man
but
little
used
to
that
form
of
address
)
:
and
said
,
"
Mrs
Dombey
,
my
---
my
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
transient
flush
of
faint
surprise
overspread
the
sick
lady
's
face
as
she
raised
her
eyes
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
christened
Paul
,
my
---
Mrs
Dombey
---
of
course
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
feebly
echoed
,
"
Of
course
,
"
or
rather
expressed
it
by
the
motion
of
her
lips
,
and
closed
her
eyes
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
father
's
name
,
Mrs
Dombey
,
and
his
grandfather
's
!
<EOS>
I
wish
his
grandfather
were
alive
this
day
!
"
<EOS>
And
again
he
said
"
Dom
-
bey
and
Son
,
"
in
exactly
the
same
tone
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
Those
three
words
conveyed
the
one
idea
of
Mr
Dombey
's
life
.
<EOS>
The
earth
was
made
for
Dombey
and
Son
to
trade
in
,
and
the
sun
and
moon
were
made
to
give
them
light
.
<EOS>
Rivers
and
seas
were
formed
to
float
their
ships
;
rainbows
gave
them
promise
of
fair
weather
;
winds
blew
for
or
against
their
enterprises
;
stars
and
planets
circled
in
their
orbits
,
to
preserve
inviolate
a
system
of
which
they
were
the
centre
.
<EOS>
Common
abbreviations
took
new
meanings
in
his
eyes
,
and
had
sole
reference
to
them
:
AD
had
no
concern
with
anno
Domini
,
but
stood
for
anno
Dombei
---
and
Son
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
risen
,
as
his
father
had
before
him
,
in
the
course
of
life
and
death
,
from
Son
to
Dombey
,
and
for
nearly
twenty
years
had
been
the
sole
representative
of
the
firm
.
<EOS>
Of
those
years
he
had
been
married
,
ten
---
married
,
as
some
said
,
to
a
lady
with
no
heart
to
give
him
;
whose
happiness
was
in
the
past
,
and
who
was
content
to
bind
her
broken
spirit
to
the
dutiful
and
meek
endurance
of
the
present
.
<EOS>
Such
idle
talk
was
little
likely
to
reach
the
ears
of
Mr
Dombey
,
whom
it
nearly
concerned
;
and
probably
no
one
in
the
world
would
have
received
it
with
such
utter
incredulity
as
he
,
if
it
had
reached
him
.
<EOS>
Dombey
and
Son
had
often
dealt
in
hides
,
but
never
in
hearts
.
<EOS>
They
left
that
fancy
ware
to
boys
and
girls
,
and
boarding
-
schools
and
books
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
would
have
reasoned
:
That
a
matrimonial
alliance
with
himself
must
,
in
the
nature
of
things
,
be
gratifying
and
honourable
to
any
woman
of
common
sense
.
<EOS>
That
the
hope
of
giving
birth
to
a
new
partner
in
such
a
house
,
could
not
fail
to
awaken
a
glorious
and
stirring
ambition
in
the
breast
of
the
least
ambitious
of
her
sex
.
<EOS>
That
Mrs
Dombey
had
entered
on
that
social
contract
of
matrimony
:
almost
necessarily
part
of
a
genteel
and
wealthy
station
,
even
without
reference
to
the
perpetuation
of
family
firms
:
with
her
eyes
fully
open
to
these
advantages
.
<EOS>
That
Mrs
Dombey
had
had
daily
practical
knowledge
of
his
position
in
society
.
<EOS>
That
Mrs
Dombey
had
always
sat
at
the
head
of
his
table
,
and
done
the
honours
of
his
house
in
a
remarkably
lady
-
like
and
becoming
manner
.
<EOS>
That
Mrs
Dombey
must
have
been
happy
.
<EOS>
That
she
could
n't
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
Or
,
at
all
events
,
with
one
drawback
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
That
he
would
have
allowed
.
<EOS>
With
only
one
;
but
that
one
certainly
involving
much
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
married
ten
years
,
and
until
this
present
day
on
which
Mr
Dombey
sat
jingling
and
jingling
his
heavy
gold
watch
-
chain
in
the
great
arm
-
chair
by
the
side
of
the
bed
,
had
had
no
issue
.
   
<EOS>
---
To
speak
of
;
none
worth
mentioning
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
girl
some
six
years
before
,
and
the
child
,
who
had
stolen
into
the
chamber
unobserved
,
was
now
crouching
timidly
,
in
a
corner
whence
she
could
see
her
mother
's
face
.
<EOS>
But
what
was
a
girl
to
Dombey
and
Son
!
<EOS>
In
the
capital
of
the
House
's
name
and
dignity
,
such
a
child
was
merely
a
piece
of
base
coin
that
could
n't
be
invested
---
a
bad
Boy
---
nothing
more
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
cup
of
satisfaction
was
so
full
at
this
moment
,
however
,
that
he
felt
he
could
afford
a
drop
or
two
of
its
contents
,
even
to
sprinkle
on
the
dust
in
the
by
-
path
of
his
little
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
So
he
said
,
"
Florence
,
you
may
go
and
look
at
your
pretty
brother
,
if
you
like
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
touch
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
child
glanced
keenly
at
the
blue
coat
and
stiff
white
cravat
,
which
,
with
a
pair
of
creaking
boots
and
a
very
loud
ticking
watch
,
embodied
her
idea
of
a
father
;
but
her
eyes
returned
to
her
mother
's
face
immediately
,
and
she
neither
moved
nor
answered
.
  
<EOS>
Next
moment
,
the
lady
had
opened
her
eyes
and
seen
the
child
;
and
the
child
had
run
towards
her
;
and
,
standing
on
tip
-
toe
,
the
better
to
hide
her
face
in
her
embrace
,
had
clung
about
her
with
a
desperate
affection
very
much
at
variance
with
her
years
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
Lord
bless
me
!
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
rising
testily
.
<EOS>
"
A
very
ill
-
advised
and
feverish
proceeding
this
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
I
had
better
ask
Doctor
Peps
if
he
'll
have
the
goodness
to
step
up
stairs
again
perhaps
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
down
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
down
.
<EOS>
I
need
n't
beg
you
,
"
he
added
,
pausing
for
a
moment
at
the
settee
before
the
fire
,
"
to
take
particular
care
of
this
young
gentleman
,
Mrs
<EOS>
---
"
  
"
Blockitt
,
Sir
?
"
suggested
the
nurse
,
a
simpering
piece
of
faded
gentility
,
who
did
not
presume
to
state
her
name
as
a
fact
,
but
merely
offered
it
as
a
mild
suggestion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
this
young
gentleman
,
Mrs
Blockitt
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
Sir
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
remember
when
Miss
Florence
was
born
---
"
  
"
Ay
,
ay
,
ay
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
bending
over
the
basket
bedstead
,
and
slightly
bending
his
brows
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Miss
Florence
was
all
very
well
,
but
this
is
another
matter
.
<EOS>
This
young
gentleman
has
to
accomplish
a
destiny
.
<EOS>
A
destiny
,
little
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
As
he
thus
apostrophised
the
infant
he
raised
one
of
his
hands
to
his
lips
,
and
kissed
it
;
then
,
seeming
to
fear
that
the
action
involved
some
compromise
of
his
dignity
,
went
,
awkwardly
enough
,
away
.
  
<EOS>
Doctor
Parker
Peps
,
one
of
the
Court
Physicians
,
and
a
man
of
immense
reputation
for
assisting
at
the
increase
of
great
families
,
was
walking
up
and
down
the
drawing
-
room
with
his
hands
behind
him
,
to
the
unspeakable
admiration
of
the
family
Surgeon
,
who
had
regularly
puffed
the
case
for
the
last
six
weeks
,
among
all
his
patients
,
friends
,
and
acquaintances
,
as
one
to
which
he
was
in
hourly
expectation
day
and
night
of
being
summoned
,
in
conjunction
with
Doctor
Parker
Peps
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
"
said
Doctor
Parker
Peps
in
a
round
,
deep
,
sonorous
voice
,
muffled
for
the
occasion
,
like
the
knocker
;
"
do
you
find
that
your
dear
lady
is
at
all
roused
by
your
visit
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stimulated
as
it
were
?
"
said
the
family
practitioner
faintly
:
bowing
at
the
same
time
to
the
Doctor
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
Excuse
my
putting
in
a
word
,
but
this
is
a
valuable
connexion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
was
quite
discomfited
by
the
question
.
<EOS>
He
had
thought
so
little
of
the
patient
,
that
he
was
not
in
a
condition
to
answer
it
.
<EOS>
He
said
that
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
him
,
if
Doctor
Parker
Peps
would
walk
up
stairs
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
!
<EOS>
We
must
not
disguise
from
you
,
Sir
,
"
said
Doctor
Parker
Peps
,
"
that
there
is
a
want
of
power
in
Her
Grace
the
Duchess
<EOS>
---
I
beg
your
pardon
;
I
confound
names
;
I
should
say
,
in
your
amiable
lady
.
<EOS>
That
there
is
a
certain
degree
of
languor
,
and
a
general
absence
of
elasticity
,
which
we
would
rather
---
not
---
"
  
"
See
,
"
interposed
the
family
practitioner
with
another
inclination
of
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
so
,
"
said
Doctor
Parker
Peps
,
"
which
we
would
rather
not
see
.
<EOS>
It
would
appear
that
the
system
of
Lady
Cankaby
---
excuse
me
:
I
should
say
of
Mrs
Dombey
:
<EOS>
I
confuse
the
names
of
cases
---
"
  
"
So
very
numerous
,
"
murmured
the
family
practitioner
---
"
ca
n't
be
expected
I
'm
sure
---
quite
wonderful
if
otherwise
<EOS>
---
Doctor
Parker
Peps
's
West
-
End
practice
---
"
  
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
"
quite
so
.
<EOS>
It
would
appear
,
I
was
observing
,
that
the
system
of
our
patient
has
sustained
a
shock
,
from
which
it
can
only
hope
to
rally
by
a
great
and
strong
---
"
   
"
And
vigorous
,
"
murmured
the
family
practitioner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
so
,
"
assented
the
Doctor
---
"
and
vigorous
effort
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pilkins
here
,
who
from
his
position
of
medical
adviser
in
this
family
---
no
one
better
qualified
to
fill
that
position
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
murmured
the
family
practitioner
.
"
<EOS>
"
Praise
from
Sir
Hubert
Stanley
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
are
good
enough
,
"
returned
Doctor
Parker
Peps
,
"
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pilkins
who
,
from
his
position
,
is
best
acquainted
with
the
patient
's
constitution
in
its
normal
state
(
an
acquaintance
very
valuable
to
us
in
forming
our
opinions
on
these
occasions
)
,
is
of
opinion
,
with
me
,
that
Nature
must
be
called
upon
to
make
a
vigorous
effort
in
this
instance
;
and
that
if
our
interesting
friend
the
Countess
of
Dombey
---
I
beg
your
pardon
;
Mrs
Dombey
---
should
not
be
---
"
  
"
Able
,
"
said
the
family
practitioner
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
make
that
effort
successfully
,
"
said
Doctor
Parker
Peps
,
"
then
a
crisis
might
arise
,
which
we
should
both
sincerely
deplore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
they
stood
for
a
few
seconds
looking
at
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Then
,
on
the
motion
---
made
in
dumb
show
---
of
Doctor
Parker
Peps
,
they
went
up
stairs
;
the
family
practitioner
opening
the
room
door
for
that
distinguished
professional
,
and
following
him
out
,
with
most
obsequious
politeness
.
  
<EOS>
To
record
of
Mr
Dombey
that
he
was
not
in
his
way
affected
by
this
intelligence
,
would
be
to
do
him
an
injustice
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
man
of
whom
it
could
properly
be
said
that
he
was
ever
startled
or
shocked
;
but
he
certainly
had
a
sense
within
him
,
that
if
his
wife
should
sicken
and
decay
,
he
would
be
very
sorry
,
and
that
he
would
find
a
something
gone
from
among
his
plate
and
furniture
,
and
other
household
possessions
,
which
was
well
worth
the
having
,
and
could
not
be
lost
without
sincere
regret
.
<EOS>
Though
it
would
be
a
cool
,
business
-
like
,
gentlemanly
,
self
-
possessed
regret
,
no
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
His
meditations
on
the
subject
were
soon
interrupted
,
first
by
the
rustling
of
garments
on
the
staircase
,
and
then
by
the
sudden
whisking
into
the
room
of
a
lady
rather
past
the
middle
age
than
otherwise
,
but
dressed
in
a
very
juvenile
manner
,
particularly
as
to
the
tightness
of
her
bodice
,
who
,
running
up
to
him
with
a
kind
of
screw
in
her
face
and
carriage
,
expressive
of
suppressed
emotion
,
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
,
and
said
in
a
choking
voice
,
  
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Paul
!
<EOS>
He
's
quite
a
Dombey
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
!
"
returned
her
brother
---
for
Mr
Dombey
was
her
brother
---
"
<EOS>
I
think
he
is
like
the
family
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
agitate
yourself
,
Louisa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
foolish
of
me
,
"
said
Louisa
,
sitting
down
,
and
taking
out
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
"
but
he
's
---
<EOS>
he
's
such
a
perfect
Dombey
!
<EOS>
I
never
saw
anything
like
it
in
my
life
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
is
this
about
Fanny
,
herself
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
How
is
Fanny
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Paul
,
"
returned
Louisa
,
"
it
's
nothing
whatever
.
<EOS>
Take
my
word
,
it
's
nothing
whatever
.
<EOS>
There
is
exhaustion
,
certainly
,
but
nothing
like
what
I
underwent
myself
,
either
with
George
or
Frederick
.
<EOS>
An
effort
is
necessary
.
<EOS>
That
's
all
.
<EOS>
If
dear
Fanny
were
a
Dombey
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
But
I
dare
say
she
'll
make
it
;
I
have
no
doubt
she
'll
make
it
.
<EOS>
Knowing
it
to
be
required
of
her
,
as
a
duty
,
of
course
she
'll
make
it
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Paul
,
it
's
very
weak
and
silly
of
me
,
I
know
,
to
be
so
trembly
and
shaky
from
head
to
foot
;
but
I
am
so
very
queer
that
I
must
ask
you
for
a
glass
of
wine
and
a
morsel
of
that
cake
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
should
have
fallen
out
of
the
staircase
window
as
I
came
down
from
seeing
dear
Fanny
,
and
that
tiddy
ickle
sing
.
<EOS>
"
These
last
words
originated
in
a
sudden
vivid
reminiscence
of
the
baby
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
succeeded
by
a
gentle
tap
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Chick
,
"
said
a
very
bland
female
voice
outside
,
"
how
are
you
now
,
my
dear
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Paul
,
"
said
Louisa
in
a
low
voice
,
as
she
rose
from
her
seat
,
"
it
's
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
The
kindest
creature
!
<EOS>
I
never
could
have
got
here
without
her
!
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
,
my
brother
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
Paul
,
my
dear
,
my
very
particular
friend
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
lady
thus
specially
presented
,
was
a
long
lean
figure
,
wearing
such
a
faded
air
that
she
seemed
not
to
have
been
made
in
what
linen
-
drapers
call
"
fast
colours
"
originally
,
and
to
have
,
by
little
and
little
,
washed
out
.
<EOS>
But
for
this
she
might
have
been
described
as
the
very
pink
of
general
propitiation
and
politeness
.
<EOS>
From
a
long
habit
of
listening
admirably
to
everything
that
was
said
in
her
presence
,
and
looking
at
the
speakers
as
if
she
were
mentally
engaged
in
taking
off
impressions
of
their
images
upon
her
soul
,
never
to
part
with
the
same
but
with
life
,
her
head
had
quite
settled
on
one
side
.
<EOS>
Her
hands
had
contracted
a
spasmodic
habit
of
raising
themselves
of
their
own
accord
as
in
involuntary
admiration
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
liable
to
a
similar
affection
.
<EOS>
She
had
the
softest
voice
that
ever
was
heard
;
and
her
nose
,
stupendously
aquiline
,
had
a
little
knob
in
the
very
centre
or
key
-
stone
of
the
bridge
,
whence
it
tended
downwards
towards
her
face
,
as
in
an
invincible
determination
never
to
turn
up
at
anything
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
's
dress
,
though
perfectly
genteel
and
good
,
had
a
certain
character
of
angularity
and
scantiness
.
<EOS>
She
was
accustomed
to
wear
odd
weedy
little
flowers
in
her
bonnets
and
caps
.
<EOS>
Strange
grasses
were
sometimes
perceived
in
her
hair
;
and
it
was
observed
by
the
curious
,
of
all
her
collars
,
frills
,
tuckers
,
wristbands
,
and
other
gossamer
articles
---
indeed
of
everything
she
wore
which
had
two
ends
to
it
intended
to
unite
---
that
the
two
ends
were
never
on
good
terms
,
and
would
n't
quite
meet
without
a
struggle
.
<EOS>
She
had
furry
articles
for
winter
wear
,
as
tippets
,
boas
,
and
muffs
,
which
stood
up
on
end
in
a
rampant
manner
,
and
were
not
at
all
sleek
.
<EOS>
She
was
much
given
to
the
carrying
about
of
small
bags
with
snaps
to
them
<EOS>
,
that
went
off
like
little
pistols
when
they
were
shut
up
;
and
when
full
-
dressed
,
she
wore
round
her
neck
the
barrenest
of
lockets
,
representing
a
fishy
old
eye
,
with
no
approach
to
speculation
in
it
.
<EOS>
These
and
other
appearances
of
a
similar
nature
,
had
served
to
propagate
the
opinion
,
that
Miss
Tox
was
a
lady
of
what
is
called
a
limited
independence
,
which
she
turned
to
the
best
account
.
<EOS>
Possibly
her
mincing
gait
encouraged
the
belief
,
and
suggested
that
her
clipping
a
step
of
ordinary
compass
into
two
or
three
,
originated
in
her
habit
of
making
the
most
of
everything
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
with
a
prodigious
curtsey
,
"
that
to
have
the
honour
of
being
presented
to
Mr
Dombey
<EOS>
is
a
distinction
which
I
have
long
sought
,
but
very
little
expected
at
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Mrs
Chick
---
may
I
say
Louisa
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
took
Miss
Tox
's
hand
in
hers
,
rested
the
foot
of
her
wine
-
glass
upon
it
,
repressed
a
tear
,
and
said
in
a
low
voice
"
Bless
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Louisa
then
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
"
my
sweet
friend
<EOS>
,
how
are
you
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Better
,
"
Mrs
Chick
returned
.
<EOS>
"
Take
some
wine
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
almost
as
anxious
as
I
have
been
,
and
must
want
it
,
I
am
sure
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
of
course
officiated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Tox
,
Paul
,
"
pursued
Mrs
Chick
,
still
retaining
her
hand
,
"
knowing
how
much
I
have
been
interested
in
the
anticipation
of
the
event
of
to
-
day
,
has
been
working
at
a
little
gift
for
Fanny
,
which
I
promised
to
present
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
a
pin
-
cushion
for
the
toilette
table
,
Paul
,
but
I
do
say
,
and
will
say
,
and
must
say
,
that
Miss
Tox
has
very
prettily
adapted
the
sentiment
to
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
call
"
Welcome
little
Dombey
"
Poetry
,
myself
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
the
device
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
device
,
"
returned
Louisa
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
do
me
the
justice
to
remember
,
my
dear
Louisa
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
in
a
tone
of
low
and
earnest
entreaty
,
"
that
nothing
but
<EOS>
the
---
I
have
some
difficulty
in
expressing
myself
---
the
dubiousness
of
the
result
would
have
induced
me
to
take
so
great
<EOS>
a
liberty
:
"
<EOS>
Welcome
,
Master
Dombey
,
"
would
have
been
much
more
congenial
to
my
feelings
,
as
I
am
sure
you
know
.
<EOS>
But
the
uncertainty
attendant
on
angelic
strangers
<EOS>
,
will
,
I
hope
,
excuse
what
must
otherwise
appear
an
unwarrantable
familiarity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
made
a
graceful
bend
as
she
spoke
,
in
favour
of
Mr
Dombey
,
which
that
gentleman
graciously
acknowledged
.
<EOS>
Even
the
sort
of
recognition
of
Dombey
and
Son
,
conveyed
in
the
foregoing
conversation
,
was
so
palatable
to
him
,
that
his
sister
,
Mrs
Chick
---
though
he
affected
to
consider
her
a
weak
good
-
natured
person
---
had
perhaps
more
influence
over
him
than
anybody
else
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
with
a
sweet
smile
,
"
after
this
,
I
forgive
Fanny
everything
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
declaration
in
a
Christian
spirit
,
and
Mrs
Chick
felt
that
it
did
her
good
.
<EOS>
Not
that
she
had
anything
particular
to
forgive
in
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
nor
indeed
anything
at
all
,
except
her
having
married
her
brother
---
in
itself
a
species
of
audacity
---
and
her
having
,
in
the
course
of
events
,
given
birth
to
a
girl
instead
of
a
boy
:
which
,
as
Mrs
Chick
had
frequently
observed
,
was
not
quite
what
she
had
expected
of
her
,
and
was
not
a
pleasant
return
for
all
the
attention
and
distinction
she
had
met
with
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
being
hastily
summoned
out
of
the
room
at
this
moment
,
the
two
ladies
were
left
alone
together
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
immediately
became
spasmodic
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
would
admire
my
brother
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
<EOS>
so
before
-
hand
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Louisa
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
's
hands
and
eyes
expressed
how
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
as
to
his
property
,
my
dear
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
with
deep
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
m
---
mense
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
his
deportment
,
my
dear
Louisa
!
"
said
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
presence
!
<EOS>
His
dignity
!
<EOS>
No
portrait
that
I
have
ever
seen
of
any
one
has
been
half
so
replete
with
those
qualities
.
<EOS>
Something
so
stately
,
you
know
:
<EOS>
so
uncompromising
:
so
very
wide
across
the
chest
:
so
upright
!
<EOS>
A
pecuniary
Duke
of
York
,
my
love
,
and
nothing
short
of
it
!
"
said
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
I
should
designate
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
Paul
!
"
exclaimed
his
sister
,
as
he
returned
,
"
you
look
quite
pale
!
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
Louisa
,
that
they
tell
me
that
Fanny
---
"
  
"
Now
,
my
dear
Paul
,
"
returned
his
sister
rising
,
"
do
n't
believe
it
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
reliance
on
my
experience
,
Paul
,
you
may
rest
<EOS>
assured
that
there
is
nothing
wanting
but
an
effort
on
Fanny
's
part
.
<EOS>
And
that
effort
,
"
she
continued
,
taking
off
her
bonnet
,
and
adjusting
her
cap
and
gloves
,
in
a
business
-
like
manner
<EOS>
,
"
she
must
be
encouraged
,
and
really
,
if
necessary
,
urged
to
make
.
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
Paul
,
come
up
stairs
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
who
,
besides
being
generally
influenced
by
his
sister
for
the
reason
already
mentioned
,
had
really
faith
in
her
as
an
experienced
and
bustling
matron
,
acquiesced
:
and
followed
her
,
at
once
,
to
the
sick
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
The
lady
lay
upon
her
bed
as
he
had
left
her
,
clasping
her
little
daughter
to
her
breast
.
<EOS>
The
child
clung
close
about
her
,
with
the
same
intensity
as
before
,
and
never
raised
her
head
,
or
moved
her
soft
cheek
from
her
mother
's
face
,
or
looked
on
those
who
stood
around
,
or
spoke
,
or
moved
,
or
shed
a
tear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Restless
without
the
little
girl
,
"
the
Doctor
whispered
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
We
found
it
best
to
have
her
in
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
such
a
solemn
stillness
round
the
bed
;
and
the
two
medical
attendants
seemed
to
look
on
the
impassive
form
with
so
much
compassion
and
so
little
hope
,
that
Mrs
Chick
was
for
the
moment
diverted
from
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
But
presently
summoning
courage
,
and
what
she
called
presence
of
mind
,
she
sat
down
by
the
bedside
,
and
said
in
the
low
precise
tone
of
one
who
endeavours
to
awaken
a
sleeper
:
  
"
<EOS>
Fanny
!
<EOS>
Fanny
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
sound
in
answer
but
the
loud
ticking
of
Mr
Dombey
's
watch
and
Doctor
Parker
Peps
's
watch
,
which
seemed
in
the
silence
to
be
running
a
race
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fanny
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
with
assumed
lightness
,
"
<EOS>
here
's
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
come
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
speak
to
him
?
<EOS>
They
want
to
lay
your
little
boy
---
the
baby
,
Fanny
,
you
know
;
you
have
hardly
seen
him
yet
,
I
think
---
in
bed
;
but
they
ca
n't
till
you
rouse
yourself
a
little
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
it
's
time
you
roused
yourself
a
little
?
<EOS>
Eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
bent
her
ear
to
the
bed
,
and
listened
:
at
the
same
time
looking
round
at
the
bystanders
,
and
holding
up
her
finger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
<EOS>
"
she
repeated
,
"
what
was
it
<EOS>
you
said
,
Fanny
?
<EOS>
I
did
n't
hear
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
No
word
or
sound
in
answer
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
watch
and
Dr
Parker
Peps
's
watch
seemed
to
be
racing
faster
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
really
,
Fanny
my
dear
,
"
said
the
sister
-
in
-
law
,
altering
her
position
,
and
speaking
less
confidently
,
and
more
earnestly
,
in
spite
of
herself
,
"
I
shall
have
to
be
quite
cross
with
you
,
if
you
do
n't
rouse
yourself
.
<EOS>
It
's
necessary
for
you
to
make
an
effort
,
and
perhaps
a
very
great
and
painful
effort
which
you
are
not
disposed
to
make
;
but
this
is
a
world
of
effort
you
know
,
Fanny
,
and
we
must
never
yield
,
when
so
much
depends
upon
us
.
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
Try
!
<EOS>
I
must
really
scold
you
if
you
do
n't
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
race
in
the
ensuing
pause
was
fierce
and
furious
.
<EOS>
The
watches
seemed
to
jostle
,
and
to
trip
each
other
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fanny
!
<EOS>
"
said
Louisa
,
glancing
round
,
with
a
gathering
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
Only
open
your
eyes
to
show
me
that
you
hear
and
understand
me
;
will
you
?
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
,
gentlemen
,
what
is
to
be
done
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
two
medical
attendants
exchanged
a
look
across
the
bed
;
and
the
Physician
,
stooping
down
,
whispered
in
the
child
's
ear
.
<EOS>
Not
having
understood
the
purport
of
his
whisper
,
the
little
creature
turned
her
perfectly
colourless
face
,
and
deep
dark
eyes
towards
him
;
but
without
loosening
her
hold
in
the
least
.
  
<EOS>
The
whisper
was
repeated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mama
!
"
said
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
The
little
voice
,
familiar
and
dearly
loved
,
awakened
some
show
of
consciousness
,
even
at
that
ebb
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
,
the
closed
eye
-
lids
trembled
,
and
the
nostril
quivered
,
and
the
faintest
shadow
of
a
smile
was
seen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mama
!
"
cried
the
child
sobbing
aloud
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
Mama
!
<EOS>
oh
dear
Mama
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Doctor
gently
brushed
the
scattered
ringlets
of
the
child
,
aside
from
the
face
and
mouth
of
the
mother
.
<EOS>
Alas
how
calm
they
lay
there
;
how
little
breath
there
was
to
stir
them
!
  
<EOS>
Thus
,
clinging
fast
to
that
slight
spar
within
her
arms
,
the
mother
drifted
out
upon
the
dark
and
unknown
sea
that
rolls
round
all
the
world
.

In
which
Timely
Provision
is
made
for
an
Emergency
that
will
sometimes
arise
in
the

regulated
Families
 
<EOS>
"
I
SHALL
never
cease
to
congratulate
myself
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
"
on
having
said
,
when
I
little
thought
what
was
in
store
for
us
,
---
really
as
if
I
was
inspired
by
something
,
---
that
I
forgave
poor
dear
Fanny
everything
.
<EOS>
Whatever
happens
,
that
must
always
be
a
comfort
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
made
this
impressive
observation
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
after
having
descended
thither
from
the
inspection
of
the
Mantua
-
Makers
up
stairs
,
who
were
busy
on
the
family
mourning
.
<EOS>
She
delivered
it
for
the
behoof
of
Mr
Chick
,
who
was
a
stout
bald
gentleman
,
with
a
very
large
face
,
and
his
hands
continually
in
his
pockets
,
and
who
had
a
tendency
in
his
nature
to
whistle
and
hum
tunes
,
which
,
sensible
of
the
indecorum
of
such
sounds
in
a
house
of
grief
,
he
was
at
some
pains
to
repress
at
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
over
-
exert
yourself
,
Loo
,
"
said
Mr
Chick
,
"
or
you
'll
be
laid
up
with
spasms
<EOS>
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
Right
tol
loor
rul
!
<EOS>
Bless
my
soul
,
I
forgot
!
<EOS>
We
're
here
one
day
and
gone
the
next
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
contented
herself
with
a
glance
of
reproof
,
and
then
proceeded
with
the
thread
of
her
discourse
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
hope
this
heart
-
rending
occurrence
will
be
a
warning
to
all
of
us
,
to
accustom
ourselves
to
rouse
ourselves
,
and
to
make
efforts
in
time
where
they
're
required
of
us
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
moral
in
everything
,
if
we
would
only
avail
ourselves
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
our
own
faults
if
we
lose
sight
of
this
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Chick
invaded
the
grave
silence
which
ensued
on
this
remark
with
the
singularly
inappropriate
air
of
"
A
cobbler
there
was
;
"
and
checking
himself
,
in
some
confusion
,
observed
,
that
it
was
undoubtedly
our
own
faults
if
we
did
n't
improve
such
melancholy
occasions
as
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
Which
might
be
better
improved
,
I
should
think
,
Mr
C
,
"
retorted
his
helpmate
,
after
a
short
pause
,
"
than
by
the
introduction
,
either
of
the
college
hornpipe
,
or
the
equally
unmeaning
and
unfeeling
remark
of
rump
-
te
-
iddity
,
bow
-
wow
-
wow
!
"
---
which
Mr
Chick
had
indeed
indulged
in
under
his
breath
,
and
which
Mrs
Chick
repeated
in
a
tone
of
withering
scorn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Merely
habit
,
my
dear
,
"
pleaded
Mr
Chick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
Habit
!
"
returned
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
're
a
rational
being
,
do
n't
make
such
ridiculous
excuses
.
<EOS>
Habit
!
<EOS>
If
I
was
to
get
a
habit
(
as
you
call
it
)
of
walking
on
the
ceiling
,
like
the
flies
,
I
should
hear
enough
of
it
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
appeared
so
probable
that
such
a
habit
might
be
attended
with
some
degree
of
notoriety
,
that
Mr
Chick
did
n't
venture
to
dispute
the
position
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
's
the
Baby
,
Loo
?
"
asked
Mr
Chick
:
to
change
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
Baby
do
you
mean
?
"
answered
Mrs
Chick
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
the
morning
I
have
had
,
with
that
dining
-
room
down
stairs
one
mass
of
babies
,
no
one
in
their
senses
would
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
mass
of
babies
!
"
repeated
Mr
Chick
,
staring
with
an
alarmed
expression
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
occurred
to
most
men
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
"
that
poor
dear
Fanny
being
no
more
,
it
becomes
necessary
to
provide
a
Nurse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
Ah
!
"
said
Mr
Chick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Toor
-
rul
---
<EOS>
such
is
life
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
suited
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
am
not
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
;
"
nor
likely
to
be
,
so
far
as
I
can
see
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
of
course
,
the
child
is
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
Going
to
the
very
Deuce
,
"
said
Mr
Chick
,
thoughtfully
,
"
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Admonished
,
however
,
that
he
had
committed
himself
,
by
the
indignation
expressed
in
Mrs
Chick
's
countenance
at
the
idea
of
a
Dombey
going
there
;
and
thinking
to
atone
for
his
misconduct
by
a
bright
suggestion
,
he
added
:
  
"
<EOS>
Could
n't
something
temporary
be
done
with
a
teapot
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
he
had
meant
to
bring
the
subject
prematurely
to
a
close
,
he
could
not
have
done
it
more
effectually
.
<EOS>
After
looking
at
him
for
some
moments
in
silent
resignation
,
Mrs
Chick
walked
majestically
to
the
window
and
peeped
through
the
blind
,
attracted
by
the
sound
of
wheels
.
<EOS>
Mr
Chick
,
finding
that
his
destiny
was
,
for
the
time
,
against
him
,
said
no
more
,
and
walked
off
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
always
thus
with
Mr
Chick
.
<EOS>
He
was
often
in
the
ascendant
himself
,
and
at
those
times
punished
Louisa
roundly
.
<EOS>
In
their
matrimonial
bickerings
they
were
,
upon
the
whole
,
a
well
-
matched
,
fairly
-
balanced
,
give
-
and
-
take
couple
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
,
generally
speaking
,
very
difficult
to
have
betted
on
the
winner
.
<EOS>
Often
when
Mr
Chick
seemed
beaten
,
he
would
suddenly
make
a
start
,
turn
the
tables
,
clatter
them
about
the
ears
of
Mrs
Chick
,
and
carry
all
before
him
.
<EOS>
Being
liable
himself
to
similar
unlookedfor
checks
from
Mrs
Chick
,
their
little
contests
usually
possessed
a
character
of
uncertainty
that
was
very
animating
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
had
arrived
on
the
wheels
just
now
alluded
to
,
and
came
running
into
the
room
in
a
breathless
condition
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Louisa
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
"
is
the
vacancy
still
unsupplied
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
good
soul
,
yes
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
my
dear
Louisa
,
"
returned
Miss
Tox
,
"
I
hope
and
believe
---
but
in
one
moment
,
my
dear
,
I
'll
introduce
the
party
.
"
  
<EOS>
Running
down
stairs
again
as
fast
as
she
had
run
up
,
Miss
Tox
got
the
party
out
of
the
hackney
-
coach
,
and
soon
returned
with
it
under
convoy
.
  
<EOS>
It
then
appeared
that
she
had
used
the
word
,
not
in
its
legal
or
business
acceptation
,
when
it
merely
expresses
an
individual
,
but
as
a
noun
of
multitude
,
or
signifying
many
:
for
Miss
Tox
escorted
a
plump
rosy
-
cheeked
wholesome
apple
-
faced
young
woman
,
with
an
infant
in
her
arms
;
a
younger
woman
not
so
plump
,
but
apple
-
faced
also
,
who
led
a
plump
and
apple
-
faced
child
in
each
hand
;
another
plump
and
also
apple
-
faced
boy
who
walked
by
himself
;
and
finally
,
a
plump
and
apple
-
faced
man
,
who
carried
in
his
arms
another
plump
and
apple
-
faced
boy
,
whom
he
stood
down
on
the
floor
,
and
admonished
,
in
a
husky
whisper
,
to
"
kitch
hold
of
his
brother
Johnny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Louisa
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
"
knowing
your
great
anxiety
,
and
wishing
to
relieve
it
<EOS>
,
I
posted
off
myself
to
the
Queen
Charlotte
's
Royal
Married
Females
,
which
you
had
forgot
,
and
put
the
question
,
Was
there
anybody
there
that
they
thought
would
suit
?
<EOS>
No
,
they
saidthere
was
not
.
<EOS>
When
they
gave
me
that
answer
,
I
do
assure
you
,
my
dear
,
I
was
almost
driven
to
despair
on
your
account
.
<EOS>
But
it
did
so
happen
,
that
one
of
the
Royal
Married
Females
,
hearing
the
inquiry
,
reminded
the
matron
of
another
who
had
gone
to
her
own
home
,
and
who
,
she
said
,
would
in
all
likelihood
be
most
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
The
moment
I
heard
this
,
and
had
it
corroborated
by
the
matron
---
excellent
references
and
unimpeachable
character
---
I
got
the
address
,
my
dear
,
and
posted
off
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Like
the
dear
good
Tox
,
you
are
!
"
said
Louisa
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
returned
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
so
.
<EOS>
Arriving
at
the
house
<EOS>
(
the
cleanest
place
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
You
might
eat
your
dinner
off
the
floor
)
,
I
found
the
whole
family
sitting
at
table
;
and
feeling
that
no
account
of
them
could
be
half
so
comfortable
to
you
and
Mr
Dombey
as
the
sight
of
them
all
together
<EOS>
,
I
brought
them
all
away
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
pointing
out
the
apple
-
faced
man
,
"
is
the
father
.
<EOS>
Will
you
have
the
goodness
to
come
a
little
forward
,
Sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
apple
-
faced
man
having
sheepishly
complied
with
this
request
,
stood
chuckling
and
grinning
in
a
front
row
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
his
wife
,
of
course
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
singling
out
the
young
woman
with
the
baby
.
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Polly
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
pretty
well
,
I
thank
you
,
Ma'am
,
"
said
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
By
way
of
bringing
her
out
dexterously
,
Miss
Tox
had
made
the
inquiry
as
in
condescension
to
an
old
acquaintance
whom
she
had
n't
seen
for
a
fortnight
or
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
,
m
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
other
young
woman
is
her
unmarried
sister
who
lives
with
them
,
and
would
take
care
of
her
children
.
<EOS>
Her
name
's
Jemima
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
,
Jemima
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
pretty
well
,
I
thank
you
,
Ma'am
,
"
returned
Jemima
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
glad
indeed
to
hear
it
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
'll
keep
so
.
<EOS>
Five
children

<EOS>
Youngest

weeks

<EOS>
The
fine
little
boy
with
the
blister
on
his
nose
is
the
eldest
.
<EOS>
The
blister
,
I
believe
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
looking
round
upon
the
family
,
"
is
not
constitutional
,
but
accidental
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
apple
-
faced
man
was
understood
to
growl
,
"
Flat
iron
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Sir
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
"
did
you
?

<EOS>
"
  
"
Flat

"
he
repeated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
quite
true
.
<EOS>
I
forgot
.
<EOS>
The
little
creature
,
in
his
mother
's
absence
,
smelt
a
warm
flat
iron
.
<EOS>
You
're
quite
right
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
You
were
going
to
have
the
goodness
to
inform
me
,
when
we
arrived
at
the
door
that
you
were
by
trade
,
a
---
"
  
"
Stoker
,
"
said
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
choker
!
<EOS>
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
quite
aghast
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stoker
,
"
said
the
man
.
"
<EOS>
Stream
ingine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
-
h
!
<EOS>
Yes
!
"
returned
Miss
Tox
,
looking
thoughtfully
at
him
,
and
seeming
still
to
have
but
a
very
imperfect
understanding
of
his
meaning
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
do
you
like
it
,
Sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Which
,
Mum
?
"
said
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
,
"
replied
Miss
Tox
.
"
<EOS>
Your
trade
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
Pretty
well
,
Mum
.
<EOS>
The
ashes
sometimes
gets
in
here
;
"
touching
his
chest
:
"
and
makes
a
man
speak
gruff
,
as
at
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
ashes
,
Mum
,
not
crustiness
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
seemed
to
be
so
little
enlightened
by
this
reply
,
as
to
find
a
difficulty
in
pursuing
the
subject
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Chick
relieved
her
,
by
entering
into
a
close
private
examination
of
Polly
,
her
children
,
her
marriage
certificate
,
testimonials
,
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
Polly
coming
out
unscathed
from
this
ordeal
,
Mrs
Chick
withdrew
with
her
report
to
her
brother
's
room
,
and
as
an
emphatic
comment
on
it
,
and
corroboration
of
it
,
carried
the
two
rosiest
little
Toodles
with
her
,
Toodle
being
the
family
name
of
the
apple
-
faced
family
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
had
remained
in
his
own
apartment
since
the
death
of
his
wife
,
absorbed
in
visions
of
the
youth
,
education
,
and
destination
of
his
baby
son
.
<EOS>
Something
lay
at
the
bottom
of
his
cool
heart
,
colder
and
heavier
than
its
ordinary
load
;
but
it
was
more
a
sense
of
the
child
's
loss
than
his
own
,
awakening
within
him
an
almost
angry
sorrow
.
<EOS>
That
the
life
and
progress
on
which
he
built
such
hopes
,
should
be
endangered
in
the
outset
by
<EOS>
so
mean
a
want
;
that
Dombey
and
Son
should
be
tottering
for
a
nurse
,
was
a
sore
humiliation
.
<EOS>
And
yet
in
his
pride
and
jealousy
,
he
viewed
with
so
much
bitterness
the
thought
of
being
dependent
for
the
very
first
step
towards
the
accomplishment
of
his
soul
's
desire
,
on
a
hired
serving
-
woman
who
would
be
to
the
child
,
for
the
time
,
all
that
even
his
alliance
could
have
made
his
own
wife
,
that
in
every
new
rejection
of
a
candidate
he
felt
a
secret
pleasure
.
<EOS>
The
time
had
now
come
,
however
,
when
he
could
no
longer
be
divided
between
these
two
sets
of
feelings
.
<EOS>
The
less
so
,
as
there
seemed
to
be
no
flaw
in
the
title
of
Polly
Toodle
after
his
sister
had
set
it
forth
,
with
many
commendations
on
the
indefatigable
friendship
of
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
"
These
children
look
healthy
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
But
to
think
of
their
some
day
claiming
a
sort
of
relationship
to
Paul!Take
them
away
,
Louisa
!
<EOS>
Let
me
see
this
woman
and
her
husband
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
bore
off
the
tender
pair
of
Toodles
,
and
presently
returned
with
that
tougher
couple
whose
presence
her
brother
had
commanded
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
good
woman
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
turning
round
in
his
easy
chair
,
as
one
piece
,
and
not
as
a
man
with
limbs
and
joints
,
"
I
understandyou
are
poor
,
and
wish
to
earn
money
by
nursing
the
little
boy
,
my
son
,
who
has
been
so
prematurely
deprived
of
what
can
never
be
replaced
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
objection
to
your
adding
to
the
comforts
of
your
family
by
that
means
.
<EOS>
So
far
as
I
can
tell
,
you
seem
to
be
a
deserving
object
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
impose
one
or
two
conditions
on
you
,
before
you
enter
my
house
in
that
capacity
.
<EOS>
while
you
are
here
,
I
must
stipulate
that
you
are
always
known
as
---
say
as
Richards
---
an
ordinary
name
,
and
convenient
.
<EOS>
Have
you
any
objection
to
be
known
as
Richards
?
<EOS>
You
had
better
consult
your
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
husband
did
nothing
but
chuckle
and
grin
,
and
continually
draw
his
right
hand
across
his
mouth
,
moistening
the
palm
,
Mrs
Toodle
,
after
nudging
him
twice
or
thrice
in
vain
,
dropped
a
curtsey
and
replied
"
that
perhaps
if
she
was
to
be
called
out
of
her
name
,
it
would
be
considered
in
the
wages
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
of
course
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
I
desire
to
make
it
a
question
of
wages
,
altogether
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Richards
,
if
you
nurse
my
bereaved
child
,
Iwish
you
to
remember
this
always
.
<EOS>
You
will
receive
a
liberal
stipend
in
return
for
the
discharge
of
certain
duties
,
in
the
performance
of
which
,
I
wish
you
to
see
as
little
of
your
family
as
possible
.
<EOS>
When
those
duties
cease
to
be
required
and
rendered
,
and
the
stipend
ceases
to
be
paid
,
there
is
an
end
of
all
relations
between
us
.
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Toodle
seemed
doubtful
about
it
;
and
as
to
Toodle
himself
,
he
had
evidently
no
doubt
whatever
,
that
he
was
all
abroad
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
children
of
your
own
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
at
all
in
this
bargain
that
you
need
become
attached
to
my
child
,
or
that
my
child
need
become
attached
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
expect
or
desire
anything
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
Quite
the
reverse
.
<EOS>
When
you
go
away
from
here
,
you
will
have
concluded
what
is
a
mere
matter
of
bargain
and
sale
,
hiring
and
letting
:
and
will
stay
away
.
<EOS>
The
child
will
cease
to
remember
you
;
and
you
will
cease
,
if
you
please
,
to
remember
the
child
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Toodle
,
with
a
little
more
colour
in
her
cheeks
than
she
had
had
before
,
said
"
she
hoped
she
knew
her
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
do
,
Richards
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
you
know
it
very
well
.
<EOS>
Indeed
it
is
so
plain
and
obvious
that
it
could
hardly
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Louisa
,
my
dear
,
arrange
with
Richards
about
money
,
and
let
her
have
it
when
and
how
she
pleases
.
<EOS>
Mr
what's
-
your
name
,
a
word
with
you
,
if
you
please
!
"
  
<EOS>
Thus
arrested
on
the
threshold
as
he
was
following
his
wife
out
of
the
room
,
Toodle
returned
and
confronted
Mr
Dombey
alone
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
strong
,
loose
,
round
-
shouldered
,
shuffling
,
shaggy
fellow
,
on
whom
his
clothes
sat
negligently
:
with
a
good
deal
of
hair
and
whisker
,
deepened
in
its
natural
tint
,
perhaps
by
smoke
and
coal
-
dust
:
hard
knotty
hands
:
and
a
square
forehead
,
as
coarse
in
grain
as
the
bark
of
an
oak
.
<EOS>
A
thorough
contrast
in
all
respects
to
Mr
Dombey
,
who
was
one
of
those
close
-
shaved
close
-
cut
moneyed
gentlemen
who
are
glossy
and
crisp
like
new
bank
-
notes
,
and
who
seem
to
be
artificially
braced
and
tightened
as
by
the
stimulating
action
of
golden
shower
-
baths
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
son
,
I
believe
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Four
on
'em
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Four
hims
and
a
her
.
<EOS>
All
alive
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
's
as
much
as
you
can
afford
to
keep
them
!
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
hardly
afford
but
one
thing
in
the
world
less
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
lose
'em
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
read
?
"
asked
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
not
partick'ler
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Write
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
chalk
,
Sir
?
"
  
"
With
anything
?
"
  
"
I
could
make
shift
to
chalk
a
little
bit
,
I
think
,
if
I
was
put
to
it
,
"
said
Toodle
after
some
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
you
are
two
or
three
and
thirty
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thereabouts
,
I
suppose
,
Sir
,
"
answered
Toodle
,
after
more
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
do
n't
you
learn
?
"
asked
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
'm
a
going
to
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
One
of
my
little
boys
is
a
going
to
learn
me
,
when
he
's
old
enough
,
and
been
to
school
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
after
looking
at
him
attentively
,
and
with
no
great
favour
,
as
he
stood
gazing
round
the
room
(
principally
round
the
ceiling
)
and
still
drawing
his
hand
across
and
across
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
"
You
heard
what
I
said
to
your
wife
just
now
?
"
  
"
Polly
heerd
it
,
"
said
Toodle
,
jerking
his
hat
over
his
shoulder
in
the
direction
of
the
door
,
with
an
air
of
perfect
confidence
in
his
better
half
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
's
all
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
you
appear
to
leave
everything
to
her
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
frustrated
in
his
intention
of
impressing
his
views
still
more
distinctly
on
the
husband
,
as
the
stronger
character
,
"
I
suppose
it
is
of
no
use
my
saying
anything
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
a
bit
,
"
said
Toodle
.
<EOS>
"
Polly
heerd
it
.
<EOS>
She
's
awake
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
detain
you
any
longer
then
,
"
returned
Mr
Dombey
disappointed
.
<EOS>
"
Where
have
you
worked
all
your
life
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mostly
underground
,
Sir
,
'
till
I
got
married
.
<EOS>
I
come
to
the
level
then
.
<EOS>
I
'm
a
going
on
one
of
these
here
railroads
when
they
comes
into
full
play
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
last
straw
breaks
the
laden
camel
's
back
,
this
piece
of
underground
information
crushed
the
sinking
spirits
of
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
He
motioned
his
child
's
foster
-
father
to
the
door
,
who
departed
by
no
means
unwillingly
:
and
then
turning
the
key
,
paced
up
and
down
the
room
in
solitary
wretchedness
.
<EOS>
For
all
his
starched
,
impenetrable
dignity
and
composure
,
he
wiped
blinding
tears
from
his
eyes
as
he
did
so
;
and
often
said
,
with
an
emotion
of
which
he
would
not
,
for
the
world
,
have
had
a
witness
,
"
Poor
little
fellow
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
may
have
been
characteristic
of
Mr
Dombey
's
pride
,
that
he
pitied
himself
through
the
child
.
<EOS>
Not
poor
me
.
<EOS>
Not
poor
widower
,
confiding
by
constraint
in
the
wife
of
an
ignorant
Hind
who
has
been
working
"
mostly
underground
"
all
his
life
,
and
yet
at
whose
door
Death
had
never
knocked
,
and
at
whose
poor
table
four
sons
daily
sit
---
but
poor
little
fellow
!
  
<EOS>
Those
words
being
on
his
lips
,
it
occurred
to
him
---
and
it
is
an
instance
of
the
strong
attraction
with
which
his
hopes
and
fears
and
all
his
thoughts
were
tending
to
one
centre
---
that
a
great
temptation
was
being
placed
in
this
woman
's
way
.
<EOS>
Her
infant
was
a
boy
too
.
<EOS>
Now
,
would
it
be
possible
for
her
to
change
them
?
  
<EOS>
Though
he
was
soon
satisfied
that
he
had
dismissed
the
idea
as
romantic
and
unlikely
---
though
possible
,
there
was
no
denying
---
he
could
not
help
pursuing
it
so
far
as
to
entertain
within
himself
a
picture
of
what
his
condition
would
be
,
if
he
should
discover
such
an
imposture
when
he
was
grown
old
.
<EOS>
Whether
a
man
so
situated
,
would
be
able
to
pluck
away
the
result
of
so
many
years
of
usage
,
confidence
,
and
belief
,
from
the
impostor
,
and
endow
a
stranger
with
it
?
  
<EOS>
As
his
unusual
emotion
subsided
,
these
misgivings
gradually
melted
away
,
though
so
much
of
their
shadow
remained
behind
,
that
he
wasconstant
in
his
resolution
to
look
closely
after
Richards
himself
,
without
appearing
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Being
now
in
an
easier
frame
of
mind
,
he
regarded
the
woman
's
station
as
rather
an
advantageous
circumstance
than
otherwise
,
by
placing
,
in
itself
,
a
broad
distance
between
her
and
the
child
,
and
rendering
their
separation
easy
and
natural
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
terms
were
ratified
and
agreed
upon
between
Mrs
Chick
and
Richards
,
with
the
assistance
of
Miss
Tox
;
and
Richards
being
with
much
ceremony
invested
with
the
Dombey
baby
,
as
if
it
were
an
Order
,
resigned
her
own
,
with
many
tears
and
kisses
,
to
Jemima
.
<EOS>
Glasses
of
wine
were
then
produced
,
to
sustain
the
drooping
spirits
of
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
take
a
glass
yourself
,
Sir
,
wo
n't
you
?
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
as
Toodle
appeared
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
Mum
,
"
said
Toodle
,
"
since
you
are
suppressing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
're
very
glad
to
leave
your
dear
good
wife
in
such
a
comfortable
home
,
ai
n't
you
,
Sir
?
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
nodding
and
winking
at
him
stealthily
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mum
,
"
said
Toodle
.
<EOS>
"
Here
's
wishing
of
her
back
agin
.
"
  
Polly
cried
more
than
ever
at
this
.
<EOS>
So
Mrs
Chick
,
who
had
her
matronly
apprehensions
that
this
indulgence
in
grief
might
be
prejudicial
to
the
little
Dombey
<EOS>
(
"
acid
,
indeed
,
"
she
whispered
Miss
Tox
)
,
hastened
to
the
rescue
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
little
child
will
thrive
charmingly
with
your
sister
Jemima
,
Richards
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
;
"
and
you
have
only
to
make
an
effort
<EOS>
---
this
is
a
world
of
effort
,
you
know
,
Richards
---
to
be
very
happy
indeed
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
already
measured
for
your
mourning
,
have
n't
you
,
Richards
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ye
---
es
,
Ma'am

"
sobbed
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
'll
fit
beautifully
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
"
for
the
same
young
person
has
made
me
many
dresses
.
<EOS>
The
very
best
materials
,
too
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lor
,
you
'll
be
so
smart
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
"
that
your
husband
wo
n't
know
you
;
<EOS>
will
you
,
Sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
know
her
,
"
said
Toodle
,
gruffly
,
"
anyhows
and
anywheres
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Toodle
was
evidently
not
to
be
bought
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
living
,
Richards
,
you
know
,
"
pursued
Mrs
Chick
,
"
why
the
very
best
of
everything
will
be
at
your
disposal
.
<EOS>
You
will
order
your
little
dinner
every
day
;
and
anything
you
take
a
fancy
to
,
I
'm
sure
will
be
as
readily
provided
as
if
you
were
a
Lady

<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
to
be
sure
!
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
keeping
up
the
ball
with
great
sympathy
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
to
porter
!
<EOS>
---
quite
unlimited
,
will
it

Louisa

"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
!
"
returned
Mrs
Chick
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
a
little
abstinence
,
you
know
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
in
point
of
vegetables
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
pickles
,
perhaps
,
"
suggested
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
"
With
such
exceptions
,
"
said
Louisa
,
"
she
'll
consult
her
choice
entirely
,
and
be
under
no
restraint
at
all
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
then
,
of
course
,
you
know
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
"
however
fond
<EOS>
she
is
of
her
own
dear
little
child
---
<EOS>
and
I
'm
sure
<EOS>
,
Louisa
,
you
do
n't
blame
her
for
being
fond
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
!
"
cried
Mrs
Chick
,
benignantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Still
,
"
resumed
Miss
Tox
,
"
she
naturally
must
be
interested
in
her
young
charge
,
and
must
consider
it
a
privilege
to
see
a
little
cherub
closely
connected
with
the
superior
classes
,
gradually
unfolding
itself
from
day
to
day
at
one
common
fountain
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
so
,
Louisa
?
"
  
"
Most
undoubtedly
!
"
said
Mrs
Chick
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
love
,
she
's
already
quite
contented
and
comfortable
,
and
means
to
say
good
-
bye
to
her
sister
Jemima
and
her
little
pets
,
and
her
good
honest
husband
,
with
a
light
heart
and
a
smile
;
do
n't
she
,
my
dear
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
!
"
cried
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
she
does
!
"
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
which
,
however
,
poor
Polly
embraced
them
all
round
in
great
distress
,
and
finally
ran
away
to
avoid
any
more
particular
leave
-
taking
between
herself
and
the
children
.
<EOS>
But
the
stratagem
hardly
succeeded
as
well
as
it
deserved
;
for
the
smallest
boy
but
one
divining
her
intent
,
immediately
began
swarming
up
stairs
after
her
---
if
that
word
of
doubtful
etymology
be
admissible
---
on
his
arms
and
legs
;
while
the
eldest
(
known
in
the
family
by
the
name
of
Biler
,
in
remembrance
of
the
steam
engine
)
beat
a
demoniacal
tattoo
with
his
boots
,
expressive
of
grief
;
in
which
he
was
joined
by
the
rest
of
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
A
quantity
of
oranges
and
halfpence
thrust
indiscriminately
on
each
young
Toodle
,
checked
the
first
violence
of
their
regret
,
and
the
family
were
speedily
transported
to
their
own
home
,
by
means
of
the
hackney
-
coach
kept
in
waiting
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
The
children
,
under
the
guardianship
of
Jemima
,
blocked
up
the
window
,
and
dropped
out
oranges
and
halfpence
all
the
way
along
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toodle
himself
preferred
to
ride
behind
among
the
spikes
,
as
being
the
mode
of
conveyance
to
which
he
was
best
accustomed

In

,
as
a
Man
and

Father
,
is
seen
at
the
Head

<EOS>
THE
funeral
of
the
deceased
lady
having
been
"
performed
"
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
the
undertaker
,
as
well
as
of
the
neighbourhood
at
large
,
which
is
generally
disposed
to
be
captious
on
such
a
point
,
and
is
prone
to
take
offence
at
any
omissions
or
short
-
comings
in
the
ceremonies
,
the
various
members
of
Mr
Dombey
's
household
subsided
into
their
several
places
in
the
domestic
system
.
<EOS>
That
small
world
,
like
the
great
one
out
of
doors
,
had
the
capacity
of
easily
forgetting
its
dead
;
and
when
the
cook
had
said
she
was
a
quiet
-
tempered
lady
,
and
the
house
-
keeper
had
said
it
was
the
common
lot
,
and
the
butler
had
said
who
'd
have
thought
it
,
and
the
housemaid
had
said
she
could
n't
hardly
believe
it
,
and
the
footman
had
said
it
seemed
exactly
like
a
dream
,
they
had
quite
worn
the
subject
out
,
and
began
to
think
their
mourning
was
wearing
rusty
too
.
  
<EOS>
On
Richards
,
who
was
established
up
stairs
in
a
state
of
honourable
captivity
,
the
dawn
of
her
new
life
seemed
to
break
cold
and
grey
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
house
was
a
large
one
,
on
the
shady
side
of
a
tall
,
dark
,
dreadfully
genteel
street
in
the
region
between
Portland
Place
and
Bryanstone
Square
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
corner
house
,
with
great
wide
areas
containing
cellars
frowned
upon
by
barred
window
,
and
leered
at
by
crooked
-
eyed
doors
leading
to
dustbins
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
house
of
dismal
state
,
with
a
circular
back
to
it
,
containing
a
whole
suit
of
drawing
-
rooms
looking
upon
a
gravelled
yard
,
where
two
gaunt
trees
,
with
blackened
trunks
and
branches
,
rattled
rather
than
rustled
,
their
leaves
were
so
smoke
-
dried
.
<EOS>
The
summer
sun
was
never
on
the
street
,
but
in
the
morning
about
breakfast
-
time
,
when
it
came
with
the
water
-
carts
and
the
old
-
clothes
men
,
and
the
people
with
geraniums
,
and
the
umbrella
-
mender
,
and
the
man
who
trilled
the
little
bell
of
the
Dutch
clock
as
he
went
along
.
<EOS>
It
was
soon
gone
again
to
return
no
more
that
day
;
and
the
bands
of
music
and
the
straggling
Punch
's
shows
going
after
it
,
left
it
a
prey
to
the
most
dismal
of
organs
,
and
white
mice
;
with
now
and
then
a
porcupine
,
to
vary
the
entertainments
;
until
the
butlers
whose
families
were
dining
out
,
began
to
stand
at
the
house
-
doors
in
the
twilight
,
and
the
lamplighter
made
his
nightly
failure
in
attempting
to
brighten
up
the
street
with
gas
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
as
blank
a
house
inside
as
outside
.
<EOS>
When
the
funeral
was
over
,
Mr
Dombey
ordered
the
furniture
to
be
covered
up
---
perhaps
to
preserve
it
for
the
son
with
whom
his
plans
were
all
associated
---
and
the
rooms
to
be
ungarnished
,
saving
such
as
he
retained
for
himself
on
the
ground
floor
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
mysterious
shapes
were
made
of
tables
and
chairs
,
heaped
together
in
the
middle
of
rooms
,
and
covered
over
with
great
winding
-
sheets
.
<EOS>
Bell
-
handles
,
window
-
blinds
,
and
looking
-
glasses
,
being
papered
up
in
journals
,
daily
and
weekly
,
obtruded
fragmentary
accounts
of
deaths
and
dreadful
murders
.
<EOS>
Every
chandelier
or
lustre
,
muffled
in
Holland
,
looked
like
a
monstrous
tear
depending
from
the
ceiling
's
eye
.
<EOS>
Odours
,
as
from
vaults
and
damp
places
,
came
out
of
the
chimneys
.
<EOS>
The
dead
and
buried
lady
was
awful
in
a
picture
-
frame
of
ghastly
bandages
.
<EOS>
Every
gust
of
wind
that
rose
,
brought
eddying
round
the
corner
from
the
neighbouring
mews
,
some
fragments
of
the
straw
that
had
been
strewn
before
the
house
when
she
was
ill
,
mildewed
remains
of
which
were
still
cleaving
to
the
neighbourhood
;
and
these
,
being
always
drawn
by
some
invisible
attraction
to
the
threshold
of
the
dirty
house
to
let
immediately
opposite
,
addressed
a
dismal
eloquence
to
Mr
Dombey
's
windows
.
  
<EOS>
The
apartments
which
Mr
Dombey
reserved
for
his
own
inhabiting
,
were
attainable
from
the
hall
,
and
consisted
of
a
sitting
-
room
;
a
library
,
which
was
in
fact
a
dressing
-
room
,
so
that
the
smell
of
hot
-
pressed
paper
,
vellum
morocco
,
and
Russia
leather
,
contended
in
it
with
the
smell
of
divers
pairs
of
boots
;
and
a
kind
of
conservatory
or
little
glass
breakfast
-
room
beyond
,
commanding
a
prospect
of
the
trees
before
mentioned
,
and
,
generally
speaking
,
of
a
few
prowling
cats
.
<EOS>
These
three
rooms
opened
upon
one
another
.
<EOS>
In
the
morning
,
when
Mr
Dombey
was
at
his
breakfast
in
one
or
other
of
the
two
first
-
mentioned
of
them
,
as
well
as
in
the
afternoon
when
he
came
home
to
dinner
,
a
bell
was
rung
for
Richards
to
repair
to
this
glass
chamber
,
and
there
walk
to
and
fro
with
her
young
charge
.
<EOS>
From
the
glimpses
she
caught
of
Mr
Dombey
at
these
times
,
sitting
in
the
dark
distance
,
looking
out
towards
the
infant
from
among
the
dark
heavy
furniture
---
the
house
had
been
inhabited
for
years
by
his
father
,
and
in
many
of
its
appointments
was
old
-
fashioned
and
grim
---
she
began
to
entertain
ideas
of
him
in
his
solitary
state
,
as
if
he
were
a
lone
prisoner
in
a
cell
,
or
a
strange
apparition
that
was
not
to
be
accosted
or
understood
.
  
<EOS>
Little
Paul
Dombey
's
foster
-
mother
had
led
this
life
herself
,
and
had
carried
little
Paul
through
it
for
some
weeks
;
and
had
returned
up
stairs
one
day
from
a
melancholy
saunter
through
the
dreary
rooms
of
state
<EOS>
(
she
never
went
out
without
Mrs
Chick
,
who
called
on
fine
mornings
,
usually
accompanied
by
Miss
Tox
,
to
take
her
and
Baby
for
an
airing
---
or
in
other
words
,
to
march
them
gravely
up
and
down
the
pavement
;
like
a
walking
funeral
)
;
when
,
as
she
was
sitting
in
her
own
room
,
the
door
was
slowly
and
quietly
opened
,
and
a
dark
-
eyed
little
girl
looked
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
Miss
Florence
<EOS>
come
home
from
her
aunt
's
,
no
doubt
,
"
thought
Richards
,
who
had
never
seen
the
child
before
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hope
<EOS>
I
see
you
well
,
<EOS>
Miss.
"
  
"
Is
that
my
brother
?
"
asked
the
child
,
pointing
to
the
Baby
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
pretty
,
"
answered
Richards
.
<EOS>
"
Come
and
kiss
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
child
,
instead
of
advancing
,
looked
her
earnestly
in
the
face
,
and
said
:
  
"
What
have
you
done
with
my
Mama
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
the
little
creeter
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Richards
,
"
what
a
sad
question
!
<EOS>
I
done
?
<EOS>
Nothing
,
<EOS>
Miss.
"
  
"
What
have
they
done
with
my
Mama
?
"
inquired
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
such
a
melting
thing
in
all
my
life
!
"
<EOS>
said
Richards
,
who
naturally
substituted
for
this
child
one
of
her
own
,
inquiring
for
herself
in
like
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Come
nearer
here
,
my
dear
Miss
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afraid
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
afraid
of
you
,
"
said
the
child
,
drawing
nearer
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
want
to
know
what
they
have
done
with
my
Mama
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
darling
,
"
said
Richards
,
"
you
wear
that
pretty
black
frock
in
remembrance
of
your
Mama
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
remember
my
Mama
,
"
returned
the
child
,
with
tears
springing
to
her
eyes
,
"
in
any
frock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
people
put
on
black
,
to
remember
people
when
they
're
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
gone
?
"
asked
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
and
sit
down
by
me
,
"
said
Richards
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
a
story
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
quick
perception
that
it
was
intended
to
relate
to
what
she
had
asked
,
little
Florence
laid
aside
the
bonnet
she
had
held
in
her
hand
until
now
,
and
sat
down
on
a
stool
at
the
Nurse
's
feet
,
looking
up
into
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Once
upon
a
time
,
"
said
Richards
,
"
there
was
a
lady
---
a
very
good
lady
,
and
her
little
daughter
dearly
loved
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
good
lady
and
her
little
daughter
dearly
loved
her
,
"
repeated
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
,
when
Good
thought
it
right
that
it
should
be
so
,
was
taken
ill
and
died
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
child
shuddered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Died
,
never
to
be
seen
again
by
any
one
on
earth
,
and
was
buried
in
the
ground
where
the
trees
grow
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
cold
ground
?
"
said
the
child
,
shuddering
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
<EOS>
The
warm
ground
,
"
returned
Polly
,
seizing
her
advantage
,
"
where
the
ugly
little
seeds
turn
into
beautiful
flowers
,
and
into
grass
,
and
corn
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
all
besides
.
<EOS>
Where
good
people
turn
into
bright
angels
,
and
fly
away
to
Heaven
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
child
,
who
had
drooped
her
head
,
raised
it
again
,
and
sat
looking
at
her
intently
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
;
let
me
see
,
"
said
Polly
,
not
a
little
flurried
between
this
earnest
scrutiny
,
her
desire
to
comfort
the
child
,
her
sudden
success
,
and
her
very
slight
confidence
in
her
own
powers
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
,
when
this
lady
died
,
wherever
they
took
her
,
or
wherever
they
put
her
,
she
went
to
GOD
!
<EOS>
and
she
prayed
to
Him
,
this
lady
did
,
"
said
Polly
,
affecting
herself
beyond
measure
;
being
heartily
in
earnest
,
"
to
teach
her
little
daughter
to
be
sure
of
that
in
her
heart
:
and
to
know
that
she
was
happy
there
and
loved
her
still
:
and
to
hope
and
try
---
<EOS>
Oh
,
all
her
life
---
to
meet
her
there
one
day
,
<EOS>
never
,
never
,
never
to
part
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
my
Mama
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
child
,
springing
up
,
and
clasping
her
round
the
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
child
's
heart
,
"
said
Polly
,
drawing
her
to
her
breast
:
"
the
little
daughter
's
heart
was
so
full
of
the
truth
of
this
,
that
even
when
she
heard
it
from
a
strange
nurse
that
could
n't
tell
it
right
,
but
was
a
poor
mother
herself
and
that
was
all
,
she
found
a
comfort
in
it
---
did
n't
feel
so
lonely
---
sobbed
and
cried
upon
her
bosom
---
took
kindly
to
the
baby
lying
in
her
lap
---
and
---
there
,
there
,
there
!
"
<EOS>
said
Polly
,
smoothing
the
child
's
curls
and
dropping
tears
upon
them
.
<EOS>
"
There
,
poor
dear
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
well
,
Miss
Floy
!
<EOS>
And
wo
n't
your
Pa
be
angry
neither
!
<EOS>
"
cried
a
quick
voice
at
the
door
,
proceeding
from
a
short
,
brown
,
womanly
girl
of
fourteen
,
with
a
little
snub
nose
,
and
black
eyes
like
jet
beads
.
<EOS>
"
When
it
was
'
tickerlerly
given
out
that
you
was
n't
to
go
and
worrit
the
wet
nurse
.
"
  
"
She
do
n't
worry
me
,
"
was
the
surprised
rejoinder
of
Polly
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
fond
of
children
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
but
begging
your
pardon
,
Mrs
Richards
,
that
do
n't
matter
,
you
know
<EOS>
,
"
returned
the
black
-
eyed
girl
,
who
was
so
desperately
sharp
and
biting
that
she
seemed
to
make
one
's
eyes
water
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
be
very
fond
of
pennywinkles
,
Mrs
Richards
,
but
it
do
n't
follow
that
I
'm
to
have
'em
for
tea
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
do
n't
matter
,
"
said
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
thank'ee
,
Mrs
Richards
,
do
n't
it
!
"
returned
the
sharp
girl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Remembering
,
however
,
if
you
'll
be
so
good
,
that
Miss
Floy
's
under
my
charge
,
and
Master
Paul
's
under
your'n
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
still
we
need
n't
quarrel
,
"
said
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
Mrs
Richards
,
"
rejoined
Spitfire
.
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
I
do
n't
wish
it
,
we
need
n't
stand
upon
that
footing
,
Miss
Floy
being
a
permanency
,
Master
Paul
a
temporary
.
"
<EOS>
Spitfire
made
use
of
none
but
comma
pauses
;
shooting
out
whatever
she
had
to
say
in
one
sentence
,
and
in
one
breath
,
if
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Florence
has
just
come
home
,
has
n't
she
?
"
asked
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mrs
Richards
,
just
come
,
and
here
,
Miss
Floy
,
before
you
've
been
in
the
house
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
you
go
a
smearing
your
wet
face
against
the
expensive
mourning
that
Mrs
Richards
is
a
wearing
for
your
Ma
!
"
<EOS>
With
this
remonstrance
,
young
Spitfire
,
whose
real
name
was
Susan
Nipper
,
detached
the
child
from
her
new
friend
by
a
wrench
---
as
if
she
were
a
tooth
.
<EOS>
But
she
seemed
to
do
it
,
more
in
the
excessively
sharp
exercise
of
her
official
functions
,
than
with
any
deliberate
unkindness
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
'll
be
quite
happy
,
now
she
has
come
home
again
,
"
said
Polly
,
nodding
to
her
with
an
encouraging
smile
upon
her
wholesome
face
,
"
and
will
be
so
pleased
to
see
her
dear
Papa
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lork
,
Mr
Richards
!
"
cried
Miss
Nipper
,
taking
up
her
words
with
a
jerk
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
.
<EOS>
See
her
dear
Papa
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
her
do
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
she
then
?
"
asked
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lork
,
Mrs
Richards
,
no
,
her
Pa
's
a
deal
too
wrapped
up
in
somebody
else
,
and
before
there
was
a
somebody
else
to
be
wrapped
up
in
she
never
was
a
favourite
,
girls
are
thrown
away
in
this
house
,
Mrs
Richards
,
I
assure
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
child
looked
quickly
from
one
nurse
to
the
other
,
as
if
she
understood
and
felt
what
was
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
surprise
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Polly
.
"
<EOS>
Has
n't
Mr
Dombey
seen
her
since
---
"
  
"
No
,
"
interrupted
Susan
Nipper
.
<EOS>
"
Not
once
since
,
and
he
had
n't
hardly
set
his
eyes
upon
her
before
that
for
months
and
months
,
and
I
do
n't
think
he
'd
have
known
her
for
his
own
child
if
he
had
met
her
in
the
streets
,
or
would
know
her
for
his
own
child
if
he
was
to
meet
her
in
the
streets
to
-
morrow
,
Mrs
Richards
,
as
to
me
,
"
said
Spitfire
,
with
a
giggle
,
"
I
doubt
if
he
's
aweer
of
my
existence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
dear
!
"
said
Richards
;
meaning
,
not
Miss
Nipper
,
but
the
little
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
there
's
a
Tartar
within
a
hundred
miles
of
where
we
're
now
in
conversation
,
I
can
tell
you
,
Mrs
Richards
,
present
company
always
excepted
too
,
"
said
Susan
Nipper
;
"
wish
you
good
morning
,
Mrs
Richards
,
now
Miss
Floy
<EOS>
,
you
come
along
with
me
,
and
do
n't
go
hanging
back
like
a
naughty
wicked
child
that
judgments
is
no
example
to
,
do
n't
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
spite
of
being
thus
adjured
,
and
in
spite
also
of
some
hauling
on
the
part
of
Susan
Nipper
,
tending
towards
the
dislocation
of
her
right
shoulder
,
little
Florence
broke
away
,
and
kissed
her
new
friend
,
affectionately
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
child
.
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
!
<EOS>
I
shall
come
to
see
you
again
soon
,
and
you
'll
come
to
see
me
?
<EOS>
Susan
will
let
us
.
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
,
Susan
?
"
  
<EOS>
Spitfire
seemed
to
be
in
the
main
a
good
-
natured
little
body
,
although
a
disciple
of
that
school
of
trainers
of
the
young
idea
which
holds
that
childhood
,
like
money
,
must
be
shaken
and
rattled
and
jostled
about
a
good
deal
to
keep
it
bright
.
<EOS>
For
,
being
thus
appealed
to
with
some
endearing
gestures
and
caresses
,
she
folded
her
small
arms
and
shook
her
head
,
and
conveyed
a
relenting
expression
into
her
very
-
wide
-
open
black
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
right
of
you
to
ask
it
,
Miss
Floy
,
<EOS>
for
you
know
I
ca
n't
refuse
you
,
but
Mrs
Richards
and
me
will
see
what
can
be
done
,
if
Mrs
Richards
likes
,
I
may
wish
,
you
see
,
to
take
a
voyage
to
Chaney
,
Mrs
Richards
,
but
I
may
n't
know
how
to
leave
the
London
Docks
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Richards
assented
to
the
proposition
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
house
ai
n't
so
exactly
ringing
with
merry
-
making
,
"
said
Miss
Nipper
,
"
<EOS>
that
one
need
be
lonelier
than
one
must
be
.
<EOS>
Your
Toxes
and
your
Chickses
may
draw
out
my
two
front
double
teeth
,
Mrs
Richards
,
but
that
's
no
reason
why
I
need
offer
<EOS>
'em
the
whole
set
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
proposition
was
also
assented
to
by
Richards
,
as
an
obvious
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
'm
agreeable
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
said
Susan
Nipper
,
"
to
live
friendly
,
Mrs
Richards
,
while
Master
Paul
continues
a
permanency
,
if
the
means
can
be
planned
out
without
going
openly
against
orders
,
but
goodness
gracious
ME
,
Miss
Floy
<EOS>
,
you
have
n't
got
your
things
off
yet
,
<EOS>
you
naughty
child
,
you
have
n't
,
come
along
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
Susan
Nipper
,
in
a
transport
of
coercion
,
made
a
charge
at
her
young
ward
,
and
swept
her
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
child
,
in
her
grief
and
neglect
,
was
so
gentle
,
so
quiet
,
and
uncomplaining
;
was
possessed
of
so
much
affection
that
no
one
seemed
to
care
to
have
,
and
so
much
sorrowful
intelligence
that
no
one
seemed
to
mind
or
think
about
the
wounding
of
;
that
Polly
's
heart
was
sore
when
she
was
left
alone
again
.
<EOS>
In
the
simple
passage
that
had
taken
place
between
herself
and
the
motherless
little
girl
,
her
own
motherly
heart
had
been
touched
no
less
than
the
child
's
;
and
she
felt
,
as
the
child
did
,
that
there
was
something
of
confidence
and
interest
between
them
from
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
Nothwithstanding
Mr
Toodle
's
great
reliance
on
Polly
<EOS>
,
she
was
perhaps
in
point
of
artificial
accomplishments
very
little
his
superior
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
a
good
plain
sample
of
a
nature
that
is
ever
,
in
the
mass
,
better
,
truer
,
higher
,
nobler
,
quicker
to
feel
,
and
much
more
constant
to
retain
,
all
tenderness
and
pity
,
self
-
denial
and
devotion
,
than
the
nature
of
men
.
<EOS>
And
,
perhaps
,
unlearned
as
she
was
,
she
could
have
brought
a
dawning
knowledge
home
to
Mr
Dombey
at
that
early
day
,
which
would
not
then
have
struck
him
in
the
end
like
lightning
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
is
from
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
Polly
only
thought
,
at
that
time
,
of
improving
on
her
successful
propitiation
of
Miss
Nipper
,
and
devising
some
means
of
having
little
Florence
beside
her
,
lawfully
,
and
without
rebellion
.
<EOS>
An
opening
happened
to
present
itself
that
very
night
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
been
rung
down
into
the
glass
room
as
usual
,
and
had
walked
about
and
about
it
a
long
time
,
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
,
when
,
to
her
great
surprise
and
dismay
<EOS>
,
Mr
Dombey
came
out
,
suddenly
,
and
stopped
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
evening
,
Richards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Just
the
same
austere
,
stiff
gentleman
,
as
he
had
appeared
to
her
on
that
first
day
.
<EOS>
Such
a
hard
-
looking
gentleman
,
that
she
involuntarily
dropped
her
eyes
and
her
curtsey
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
Master
Paul
,
Richards
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
thriving
,
Sir
,
and
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
looks
so
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
glancing
with
great
interest
at
the
tiny
face
she
uncovered
for
his
observation
,
and
yet
affecting
to
be
half
careless
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
They
give
you
everything
you
want
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
thank
you
,
Sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
suddenly
appended
such
an
obvious
hesitation
to
this
reply
,
however
,
that
Mr
Dombey
,
who
had
turned
away
,
stopped
,
and
turned
round
again
,
inquiringly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
nothing
is
so
good
for
making
children
lively
and
cheerful
,
Sir
,
as
seeing
other
children
playing
about
'
em
,
"
observed
Polly
,
taking
courage
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
mentioned
to
you
,
Richards
,
when
you
came
here
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
with
a
frown
,
"
that
I
wished
you
to
see
as
little
of
your
family
as
possible
.
<EOS>
You
can
continue
your
walk
if
you
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
disappeared
into
his
inner
room
;
and
Polly
had
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
he
had
thoroughly
misunderstood
her
object
,
and
that
she
had
fallen
into
disgrace
without
the
least
advancement
of
her
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
Next
night
,
she
found
him
walking
about
the
conservatory
when
she
came
down
.
<EOS>
As
she
stopped
at
the
door
,
checked
by
this
unusual
sight
,
and
uncertain
whether
to
advance
or
retreat
,
he
called
her
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
really
think
that
sort
of
society
is
good
the
child
,
"
he
said
sharply
,
as
if
there
had
been
no
interval
since
she
proposed
it
,
"
where
's
Miss
Florence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
could
be
better
than
Miss
Florence
,
Sir
,
"
said
Polly
eagerly
,
"
but
I
understood
from
her
little
maid
that
they
were
not
to
---
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
rang
the
bell
,
and
walked
till
it
was
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
them
always
to
let
Miss
Florence
be
with
Richards
when
she
chooses
,
and
go
out
with
her
,
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
Tell
them
to
let
the
children
be
together
,
when
Richards
wishes
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
iron
was
now
hot
,
and
Richards
striking
on
it
boldly
---
it
was
a
good
cause
and
she
was
bold
in
it
,
though
instinctively
afraid
of
MrDombey
---
<EOS>
requested
that
Miss
Florence
might
be
sent
down
then
and
there
,
to
make
friends
with
here
little
brother
.
  
<EOS>
She
feigned
to
be
dandling
the
child
as
the
servant
retired
on
this
errand
,
but
she
thought
that
she
saw
Mr
Dombey
's
colour
changed
;
that
the
expression
of
his
face
quite
altered
;
that
he
turned
,
hurriedly
,
as
if
to
gainsay
what
he
had
said
,
or
she
had
said
,
or
both
,
and
was
only
deterred
by
very
shame
.
  
<EOS>
And
she
was
right
.
<EOS>
The
last
time
he
had
seen
his
slighted
child
,
there
had
been
that
in
the
sad
embrace
between
her
and
her
dying
mother
,
which
was
at
once
a
revelation
and
a
reproach
to
him
.
<EOS>
Let
him
be
absorbed
as
he
would
in
the
Son
on
whom
he
built
such
high
hopes
,
he
could
not
forget
that
closing
scene
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
forget
that
he
had
had
no
part
in
it
.
<EOS>
That
,
at
the
bottom
of
its
clear
depths
of
tenderness
and
truth
,
lay
those
two
figures
clasped
in
each
other
's
arms
,
while
he
stood
on
the
bank
above
them
,
looking
down
a
mere
spectator
---
not
a
sharer
with
them
---
quite
shut
out
.
  
<EOS>
Unable
to
exclude
these
things
from
his
remembrance
,
or
to
keep
his
mind
free
from
such
imperfect
shapes
of
the
meaning
with
which
they
were
fraught
,
as
were
able
to
make
themselves
visible
to
him
through
the
mist
of
his
pride
,
his
previous
feelings
of
indifference
towards
little
Florence
changed
into
an
uneasiness
of
an
extraordinary
kind
.
<EOS>
He
almost
felt
as
if
she
watched
and
distrusted
him
.
<EOS>
As
if
she
held
the
clue
to
something
secret
in
his
breast
,
of
the
nature
of
which
he
was
hardly
informed
himself
.
<EOS>
As
if
she
had
an
innate
knowledge
of
one
jarring
and
discordant
string
within
him
,
and
her
very
breath
could
sound
it
.
  
<EOS>
His
feeling
about
the
child
had
been
negative
from
her
birth
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
conceived
an
aversion
to
her
:
it
had
not
been
worth
his
while
or
in
his
humour
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
been
a
positively
disagreeable
object
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
now
he
was
ill
at
ease
about
her
.
<EOS>
She
troubled
his
peace
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
preferred
to
put
her
idea
aside
altogether
,
if
he
had
known
how
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
---
who
shall
decide
on
such
mysteries
!
---
he
was
afraid
that
he
might
come
to
hate
her
.
  
<EOS>
When
little
Florence
timidly
presented
herself
,
Mr
Dombey
stopped
in
his
pacing
up
and
down
and
looked
towards
her
.
<EOS>
Had
he
looked
with
greater
interest
and
with
a
father
's
eye
,
he
might
have
read
in
her
keen
glance
the
impulses
and
fears
that
made
her
waver
;
the
passionate
desire
to
run
clinging
to
him
,
crying
,
as
she
hid
her
face
in
his
embrace
,
"
Oh
father
,
try
to
love
me
!
<EOS>
there
's
no
one
else
!
"
<EOS>
the
dread
of
a
repulse
;
the
fear
of
being
too
bold
,
and
of
offending
him
;
the
pitiable
need
in
which
she
stood
of
some
assurance
and
encouragement
;
and
how
her
overcharged
young
heart
was
wandering
to
find
some
natural
resting
-
place
,
for
its
sorrow
and
affection
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
saw
nothing
of
this
.
<EOS>
He
saw
her
pause
irresolutely
at
the
door
and
look
towards
him
;
and
he
saw
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
"
he
said
,
"
come
in
:
<EOS>
what
is
the
child
afraid
of
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
came
in
;
and
after
glancing
round
her
for
a
moment
with
an
uncertain
air
,
stood
pressing
her
small
hands
hard
together
,
close
within
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
here
,
Florence
,
"
said
her
father
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
who
I
am
?
"
  
"
Yes
,
Papa
.
"
  
"
Have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
tears
that
stood
in
her
eyes
as
she
raised
them
quickly
to
his
face
,
were
frozen
by
the
expression
it
wore
.
<EOS>
She
looked
down
again
,
and
put
out
her
trembling
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
took
it
loosely
in
his
own
,
and
stood
looking
down
upon
her
for
a
moment
,
as
if
he
knew
as
little
as
the
child
,
what
to
say
or
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
<EOS>
Be
a
good
girl
,
"
he
said
,
patting
her
on
the
head
,
and
regarding
her
as
it
were
by
stealth
with
a
disturbed
and
doubtful
look
.
<EOS>
"
Go
to
Richards
!
<EOS>
Go
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
little
daughter
hesitated
for
another
instant
as
though
she
would
have
clung
about
him
still
,
or
had
some
lingering
hope
that
he
might
raise
her
in
his
arms
and
kiss
her
.
<EOS>
She
looked
up
in
his
face
once
more
.
<EOS>
He
thought
how
like
her
expression
was
then
,
to
what
it
had
been
when
she
looked
round
at
the
Doctor
---
that
night
---
and
instinctively
dropped
her
hand
and
turned
away
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
difficult
to
perceive
that
Florence
was
at
a
great
disadvantage
in
her
father
's
presence
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
only
a
constraint
upon
the
child
's
mind
,
but
even
upon
the
natural
grace
and
freedom
of
her
actions
.
<EOS>
Still
Polly
persevered
with
all
the
better
heart
for
seeing
this
;
and
,
judging
of
Mr
Dombey
by
herself
,
had
great
confidence
in
the
mute
appeal
of
poor
little
Florence
's
mourning
dress
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
hard
indeed
,
"
thought
Polly
,
"
if
he
takes
only
to
one
little
motherless
child
,
when
he
has
another
,
and
that
a
girl
,
before
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
,
Polly
kept
her
before
his
eyes
,
as
long
as
she
could
,
and
managed
so
well
with
little
Paul
,
as
to
make
it
very
plain
that
he
was
all
the
livelier
for
his
sister
's
company
.
<EOS>
When
it
was
time
to
withdraw
up
stairs
again
,
she
would
have
sent
Florence
into
the
inner
room
to
say
good
-
night
to
her
father
,
but
the
child
was
timid
and
drew
back
:
and
when
she
urged
her
again
,
said
,
spreading
her
hands
before
her
eyes
,
as
if
to
shut
out
her
own
unworthiness
,
"
Oh
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
He
do
n't
want
me
.
<EOS>
He
do
n't
want
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
little
altercation
between
them
had
attracted
the
notice
of
Mr
Dombey
,
who
inquired
from
the
table
where
he
was
sitting
at
his
wine
,
what
the
matter
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Florence
was
afraid
of
interrupting
,
Sir
,
if
she
came
in
to
say
good
-
night
,
"
said
Richards
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
does
n't
matter
,
"
returned
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
let
her
come
and
go
without
regarding
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
child
shrunk
as
she
listened
---
and
was
gone
before
her
humble
friend
looked
round
again
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
Polly
triumphed
not
a
little
in
the
success
of
her
well
-
intentioned
scheme
,
and
in
the
address
with
which
she
had
brought
it
to
bear
:
whereof
she
made
a
full
disclosure
to
Spitfire
when
she
was
once
more
safely
intrenched
up
stairs
.
<EOS>
Miss
Nipper
received
that
proof
of
her
confidence
,
as
well
as
the
prospect
of
their
free
association
for
the
future
,
rather
coldly
,
and
was
anything
but
enthusiastic
in
her
demonstrations
of
joy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
would
have
been
pleased
,
"
said
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
Mrs
Richards
,
I
'm
very
well
pleased
,
thank
you
,
"
returned
Susan
,
who
had
suddenly
become
so
very
upright
that
she
seemed
to
have
put
an
additional
bone
in
her
stays
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
show
it
,
"
said
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
Being
only
a
permanency
<EOS>
I
could
n't
be
expected
to
show
it
like
a
temporary
,
"
said
Susan
Nipper
.
<EOS>
"
Temporaries
carries
it
all
before
'em
here
,
I
find
,
but
though
there
's
a
excellent
party
-
wall
between
this
house
and
the
next
,
I
may
n't
exactly
like
to
go
to
it
,
Mrs
Richards
,
notwithstanding

the
offices
of
Dombey
and
Son
were
within
the
liberties
of
the
City
of
London
,
and
within
hearing
of
Bow
Bells
,
when
their
clashing
voices
were
not
drowned
by
the
uproar
in
the
streets
,
yet
were
there
hints
of
adventurous
and
romantic
story
to
be
observed
in
some
of
the
adjacent
objects
.
<EOS>
Gog
and
Magog
held
their
state
within
ten
minutes
'
walk
;
the
Royal
Exchange
was
close
at
hand
;
the
Bank
of
England
,
with
its
vaults
of
gold
and
silver
"
down
among
the
dead
men
"
underground
,
was
their
magnificent
neighbour
.
<EOS>
Just
round
the
corner
stood
the
rich
East
India
House
,
teeming
with
suggestions
of
precious
stuffs
and
stones
,
tigers
,
elephants
,
howdahs
,
hookahs
,
umbrellas
,
palm
trees
,
palanquins
,
and
gorgeous
princes
of
a
brown
complexion
sitting
on
carpets
,
with
their
slippers
very
much
turned
up
at
the
toes
.
<EOS>
Anywhere
in
the
immediate
vicinity
there
might
be
seen
pictures
of
ships
speeding
away
full
sail
to
all
parts
of
the
world
;
outfitting
ware
-
houses
ready
to
pack
off
anybody
anywhere
,
fully
equipped
in
half
an
hour
;
and
little
timber
midshipmen
in
obsolete
naval
uniforms
,
eternally
employed
outside
the
shop
doors
of
nautical
instrument
-
makers
in
taking
observations
of
the
hackney
coaches
.
  
<EOS>
Sole
master
and
proprietor
of
one
of
these
effigies
---
of
that
which
might
be
called
,
familiarly
,
the
woodenest
---
of
that
which
thrust
itself
out
above
the
pavement
,
right
leg
<EOS>
foremost
,
with
a
suavity
the
least
endurable
,
and
had
the
shoe
buckles
and
flapped
waistcoat
the
least
reconcileable
to
human
reason
,
and
bore
at
its
right
eye
the
most
offensively
disproportionate
piece
of
machinery
---
sole
master
and
proprietor
of
that
midshipman
,
and
proud
of
him
too
,
an
elderly
gentleman
in
a
Welsh
wig
had
paid
house
-
rent
,
taxes
,
and
dues
,
for
more
years
than
many
a
full
-
grown
midshipman
of
flesh
and
blood
has
numbered
in
his
life
;
and
midshipmen
who
have
attained
a
pretty
green
old
age
,
have
not
been
wanting
in
the
English
navy
.
  
<EOS>
The
stock
-
in
-
trade
of
this
old
gentleman
comprised
chronometers
,
barometers
,
telescopes
,
compasses
,
charts
,
maps
,
sextants
,
quadrants
,
and
specimens
of
every
kind
of
instrument
used
in
the
working
of
a
ship
's
course
,
or
the
keeping
of
a
ship
's
reckoning
,
or
the
prosecuting
of
a
ship
's
discoveries
.
<EOS>
Objects
in
brass
and
glass
were
in
his
drawers
and
on
his
shelves
,
which
none
but
the
initiated
could
have
found
the
top
of
,
or
guessed
the
use
of
,
or
having
once
examined
,
could
have
ever
got
back
again
into
their
mahogany
nests
without
assistance
.
<EOS>
Everything
was
jammed
into
the
tightest
cases
,
fitted
into
the
narrowest
corners
,
fenced
up
behind
the
most
impertinent
cushions
,
and
screwed
into
the
acutest
angles
,
to
prevent
its
philosophical
composure
from
being
disturbed
by
the
rolling
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
Such
extraordinary
precautions
were
taken
in
every
instance
to
save
room
,
and
keep
the
thing
compact
;
and
so
much
practical
navigation
was
fitted
,
and
cushioned
,
and
screwed
into
every
box
(
whether
the
box
was
a
mere
slab
,
as
some
were
,
or
something
between
a
cocked
hat
and
a
star
-
fish
,
as
others
were
,
and
those
quite
mild
and
modest
boxes
as
compared
with
others
)
;
that
the
shop
itself
,
partaking
of
the
general
infection
,
seemed
almost
to
become
a
snug
,
sea
-
going
,
ship
-
shape
concern
,
wanting
only
good
sea
-
room
,
in
the
event
of
an
unexpected
launch
,
to
work
its
way
securely
to
any
desert
island
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
Many
minor
incidents
in
the
household
life
of
the
Ships'Instrument
-
maker
who
was
proud
of
his
little
midshipman
,
assisted
and
bore
out
this
fancy
.
<EOS>
His
acquaintance
lying
chiefly
among
ship
-
chandlers
and
so
forth
<EOS>
,
he
had
always
plenty
of
the
veritable
ships
'
biscuit
on
his
table
.
<EOS>
It
was
familiar
with
dried
meats
and
tongues
,
possessing
an
extraordinary
flavour
of
rope
yarn
.
<EOS>
Pickles
were
produced
upon
it
,
in
great
wholesale
jars
,
with
"
dealer
in
all
kinds
of
Ships
'
Provisions
"
on
the
label
;
spirits
were
set
forth
in
case
bottles
with
no
throats
.
<EOS>
Old
prints
of
ships
with
alphabetical
references
to
their
various
mysteries
,
hung
in
frames
upon
the
walls
;
the
Tartar
Frigate
under
weigh
,
was
on
the
plates
;
outlandish
shells
,
seaweeds
,
and
mosses
,
decorated
the
chimney
-
piece
;
the
little
wainscotted
back
parlour
was
lighted
by
a
sky
-
light
,
like
a
cabin
.
  
<EOS>
Here
he
lived
too
,
in
skipper
-
like
state
,
all
alone
with
his
nephew
Walter
:
a
boy
of
fourteen
who
looked
quite
enough
like
a
midshipman
,
to
carry
out
the
prevailing
idea
.
<EOS>
But
there
it
ended
,
for
Solomon
Gills
himself
(
more
generally
called
old
Sol
)
was
far
from
having
a
maritime
appearance
.
<EOS>
To
say
nothing
of
his
Welsh
wig
,
which
was
as
plain
and
stubborn
<EOS>
a
Welsh
wig
as
ever
was
worn
,
and
in
which
he
looked
like
anything
but
a
Rover
,
he
was
a
slow
,
quiet
-
spoken
,
thoughtful
old
fellow
,
with
eyes
as
red
as
if
they
had
been
small
suns
looking
at
you
through
a
fog
;
and
a
newly
-
awakened
manner
,
such
as
he
might
have
acquired
by
having
stared
for
three
or
four
days
successively
through
every
optical
instrument
in
his
shop
,
and
suddenly
came
back
to
the
world
again
,
to
find
it
green
.
<EOS>
The
only
change
ever
known
in
his
outward
man
,
was
from
a
complete
suit
of
coffee
-
colour
cut
very
square
,
and
ornamented
with
glaring
buttons
,
to
the
same
suit
of
coffee
-
colour
minus
the
inexpressibles
,
which
were
then
of
a
pale
nankeen
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
very
precise
shirt
-
frill
,
and
carried
a
pair
of
first
-
rate
spectacles
on
his
forehead
,
and
a
tremendous
chronometer
in
his
fob
,
rather
than
doubt
which
precious
possession
,
he
would
have
believed
in
a
conspiracy
against
it
on
the
part
of
all
the
clocks
and
watches
in
the
City
,
and
even
of
the
very
Sun
itself
.
<EOS>
Such
as
he
was
,
such
he
had
been
in
the
shop
and
parlour
behind
the
little
midshipman
,
for
years
upon
years
;
going
regularly
aloft
to
bed
every
night
in
a
howling
garret
remote
from
the
lodgers
,
where
,
when
gentlemen
of
England
who
lived
below
at
ease
had
little
or
no
idea
of
the
state
of
the
weather
,
it
often
blew
great
guns
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
half
-
past
five
o'clock
,
and
an
autumn
afternoon
,
when
the
reader
and
Solomon
Gills
become
acquainted
.
<EOS>
Solomon
Gills
is
in
the
act
of
seeing
what
time
it
is
by
the
unimpeachable
chronometer
.
<EOS>
The
usual
daily
clearance
has
been
making
in
the
City
for
an
hour
or
more
;
and
the
human
tide
is
still
rolling
westward
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
streets
have
thinned
,
"
as
Mr
Gills
says
,
"
very
much
.
"
<EOS>
It
threatens
to
be
wet
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
All
the
weather
-
glasses
in
the
ship
are
in
low
spirits
,
and
the
rain
already
shines
upon
the
cocked
hat
of
the
wooden
midshipman
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
's
Walter
,
I
wonder
!
"
said
Solomon
Gills
,
after
he
had
carefully
put
up
the
chronometer
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
's
dinner
been
ready
,
half
an
hour
,
and
no
Walter
!
"
  
<EOS>
Turning
round
upon
his
stool
behind
the
counter
,
Mr
Gills
looked
out
among
the
instruments
in
the
window
,
to
see
if
his
nephew
might
be
crossing
the
road
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
among
the
bobbing
umbrellas
,
and
he
certainly
was
not
the
newspaper
boy
in
the
oilskin
cap
who
was
slowly
working
his
way
along
the
piece
of
brass
outside
,
writing
his
name
over
Mr
Gills'name
with
his
forefinger
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
did
n't
know
he
was
too
fond
of
me
to
make
a
run
of
it
,
and
go
and
enter
himself
aboard
ship
against
my
wishes
,
I
should
begin
to
be
fidgetty
,
"
said
Mr
Gills
,
tapping
two
or
three
weather
-
glasses
with
his
knuckles
.

<EOS>
A

merry

,
fresh
with
running
home
in

rain
;
fair

bright

As

on

said
Solomon
good

,

it

be
odd
if

been
ready
this
half

waiting

<EOS>
At
this
word
of
command
,
the
Welsh
wig
and
its
wearer
were
borne
without
resistance
into
the
back
parlour
,
as
at
the
head
of
a
boarding
party
of
five
hundred
men
;
and
Uncle
Sol
and
his
nephew
were
speedily
engaged
on
a
fried
sole
with
a
prospect
of
steak
to
follow
.
  
<EOS>
"

Solomon

He
draws
his

<EOS>

And
a

the
Uncle

the

<EOS>
"
For

the

<EOS>
Long

<EOS>
The
uncle
nodded
his
head
with
great
satisfaction
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
"
he
said
,
"
let
's
hear
something
about
the

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
there
's
not
much
to
be
told
about
the
Firm

Uncle
,
"
said
the
boy
,
plying
his
knife
and
fork
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
precious
dark
set
of
offices
,
and
in
the
room
where
I
sit
,
there
's
a
high
fender
,
and
an
iron
safe
,
and
some
cards
about
ships
that
are
going
to
sail
,
and
an
almanack
,
and
some
desks
and
stools
,
and
an
inkbottle
,
and
some
books

and
some
boxes

and
a
lot
of
cobwebs
,
and
in
one
of
'em
,
just
over
my
head
,
a
shrivelled
-
up
blue

bottle
that
looks
as
if
it
had
hung
there
ever
so
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing

said
the
uncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
No

nothing
else

except
an
old
bird

cage
<EOS>
(
I
wonder
how

<EOS>
"
No

such

"
said
old
Sol
,
looking
wistfully
at
his
nephew
out
of
the
fog
that
always
seemed
to
hang
about
him
,
and
laying
an
unctuous
emphasis
upon
the
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
plenty
of
that
I
suppose
,
"
returned
his
nephew
carelessly
;
"
but
all
that
sort
of
thing
's
in
Mr
Carker
's
room
,
or
Mr
Morfin
's
,
or
Mr
Dombey
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Has
Mr
Dombey
been
there
to

day

"
inquired
the
Uncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
!
<EOS>
In
and
out
all
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
n't
take
any
notice
of
you
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
he
did
.
<EOS>
He
walked
up
to
my
seat
<EOS>
---
I
wish
he
was
n't
so
solemn
and
stiff
,
Uncle
,
and
said
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
are
the
son
of
Mr
Gills
the
Ships
'
Instrument
-
maker
.
"
<EOS>
"
Nephew

Sir
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
said
nephew
,
boy
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
take
my
oath
<EOS>
he
said
Son
,
uncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
mistaken
<EOS>
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
It
's
no
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
's
no
matter
,
but
he
need
n't
have
been
so
sharp
,
I
thought
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
harm
in
it
though
he
did
say
Son
.
<EOS>
Then
he
told
me
that
you
had
spoken
to
him
about
me
,
and
that
he
had
found
me
employment
in
the
House
accordingly
,
and
that
I
was
expected
to
be
attentive
and
punctual
,
and
then
he
went
away
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
did
n't
seem
to
like
me
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
,
I
suppose
,
"
observed
the
Instrument
-
maker
,
"
that
you
did
n't
seem
to
like
him
much
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Uncle
,
"
returned
the
boy
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Perhaps
so
;
I
never
thought
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Solomon
looked
a
little
graver
as
he
finished
his
dinner
,
and
glanced
from
time
to
time
at
the
boy
's
bright
face
.
<EOS>
When
dinner
was
done
,
and
the
cloth
was
cleared
away
(
the
entertainment
had
been
brought
from
a
neighbouring
eating
-
house
)
,
he
lighted
a
candle
,
and
went
down
below
into
a
little
cellar
,
while
his
nephew
,
standing
on
the
mouldy
staircase
,
dutifully
held
the
light
.
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
groping
here
and
there
,
he
presently
returned
with
a
very
ancient
-
looking
bottle
,
covered
with
dust
and
dirt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Uncle
Sol
!
"
said
the
boy
,
"
what
are
you
about
?
<EOS>
that
's
the
wonderful
Madeira
!
<EOS>
---
there
's
only
one
more
bottle
!
"
  
<EOS>
Uncle
Sol
nodded
his
head
,
implying
that
he
knew
very
well
what
he
was
about
;
and
having
drawn
the
cork
in
solemn
silence
,
filled
two
glasses
and
set
the
bottle
and
a
third
clean
glass
on
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
drink
the
other
bottle
,
Wally
,
"
he
said
,
"
when
you
come
to
good
fortune
;
when
you
are
a
thriving
,
respected
,
happy
man
;
when
the
start
in
life
you
have
made
to
-
day
shall
have
brought
you
,
as
I
pray
Heaven
it
may
!
---
to
a
smooth
part
of
the
course
you
have
to
run
,
my
child
.
<EOS>
My
love
to
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Some
of
the
fog
that
hung
about
old
Sol
seemed
to
have
got
into
his
throat
;
for
he
spoke
huskily
.
<EOS>
His
hand
shook
too
,
as
he
clinked
his
glass
against
his
nephew
's
.
<EOS>
But
having
once
got
the
wine
to
his
lips
,
he
tossed
it
off
like
a
man
,
and
smacked
them
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Uncle
,
"
said
the
boy
,
affecting
to
make
light
of
it
,
while
the
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
,
"
for
the
honour
you
have
done
me
,
et
cetera
,
et
cetera
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
beg
to
propose
Mr
Solomon
Gills
with
three
times
three
and
one
cheer
more
.
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
<EOS>
and
you
'll
return
thanks
,
Uncle
,
when
we
drink
the
last
bottle
together
;
wo
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
They
clinked
their
glasses
again
;
and
Walter
,
who
was
hoarding
his
wine
,
took
a
sip
of
it
,
and
held
the
glass
up
to
his
eye
with
as
critical
an
air
as
he
could
possibly
assume
.
  
<EOS>
His
Uncle
sat
looking
at
him
for
some
time
in
silence
.
<EOS>
When
their
eyes
at
last
met
,
he
began
at
once
to
pursue
the
theme
that
had
occupied
his
thoughts
,
aloud
,
as
if
he
had
been
speaking
all
the
while
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Walter
,
"
he
said
,
"
in
truth
this
business
is
merely
a
habit
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
accustomed
to
the
habit
that
I
could
hardly
live
if
I
relinquished
it
:
<EOS>
but
there
's
nothing
doing
,
nothing
doing
.
<EOS>
When
that
uniform
was
worn
,
"
pointing
out
towards
the
little
midshipman
,
"
then
indeed
,
fortunes
were
to
be
made
,
and
were
made
.
<EOS>
But
competition
,
competition
---
new
invention
,
new
invention
---
alteration
,
alteration
---
the
world
's
gone
past
me

<EOS>
I
hardly
know
where
I
am
myself
;
much
less
where
my
customers
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
Never
mind
'em
,
Uncle
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Since
you
came
home
from
weekly
boarding
-
school
at
Peckham
,
for
instance
---
and
that
's
ten
days
,
"
said
Solomon
,
"
<EOS>
I
do
n't
remember
more
than
one
person
that
has
come
into
the
shop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Two
,
Uncle
,
do
n't
you
recollect
?
<EOS>
There
was
the
man
who
came
to
ask
for
change
for
a
sovereign
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
one
,
"
said
Solomon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Uncle
!
<EOS>
do
n't
you
call
the
women
anybody

who
came
to
ask
the
way
to
Mile

End
Turnpike

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
's
true
,
"
said
solomon
,
"
I
forgot
her
.
<EOS>
Two
persons
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
sure
,
they
did
n't
buy
anything
,
"
cried
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
They
did
n't
buy
anything
,
"
said
Solomon
,
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
want
anything
,
"
cried
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
If
they
had
,
they
'd
gone
to
another
shop
,
"
said
Solomon
,
in
the
same
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
were
two
of
'em
,
Uncle
,
"
cried
the
boy
,
as
if
that
were
a
great
triumph
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
said
only
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Wally
,
"
resumed
the
old
man
,
after
a
short
pause
:
"
not
being
like
the
Savages
who
came
on
Robinson
Crusoe
's
Island
,
we
ca
n't
live
on
a
man
who
asks
for
change
for
a
sovereign
,
and
a
woman
who
inquires
the
way
to
Mile
-
End
Turnpike
.
<EOS>
As
I
said
just
now
,
the
world
has
gone
past
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
blame
it
;
but
I
no
longer
understand
it
.
<EOS>
Tradesmen
are
not
the
same
as
they
used
to
be
,
apprentices
are
not
the
same
,
business
is
not
the
same
,
business
commodities
are
not
the
same

<EOS>
Seven
-
eighths
of
my
stock
is
old

fashioned

<EOS>
I
am
an
old
-
fashioned
man
in
an
old
-
fashioned
shop
,
in
a
street
that
is
not
the
same
as
I
remember
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
fallen
behind
the
time
,
and
am
too
old
to
catch
it
again
.
<EOS>
Even
the
noise
it
makes
a
long
way
ahead
,
confuses
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Walter
was
going
to
speak
,
but
his
Uncle
held
up
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Therefore
,
Wally
---
therefore
it
is
that
I
am
anxious
you
should
be
early
in
the
busy
world
,
and
on
the
world
's
track

<EOS>
I
am
only
the
ghost
of
this
business
---
its
substance
vanished
long
ago
;
and
when
I
die
,
its
ghost
will
be
laid
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
clearly
no
inheritance
for
you
then
,
I
have
thought
it
best
to
use
for
your
advantage
,
almost
the
only
fragment
of
the
old
connexion
that
stands
by
me
,
thought
long
habit

<EOS>
Some
people
suppose
me
to
be
wealthy

<EOS>
I
wish
for
your
sake
they
were
right

But
whatever
I
leave
behind
me

whatever
I
can
give
you

you
in
such
a

are
in
the
road

use
well

make
the
most
of

Be
diligent

like
it

a
steady

everything

to
deserve

Indeed
I
will

said
the

,
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
said
Solomon
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
it
,
"
and
he
applied
himself
to
a
second
glass
of
the
old
Madeira
,
with
increased
relish
.
"
<EOS>
As
to
the
Sea
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
that
's
well
enough
in
fiction
,
wally
,
but
it
wo
n't
do
in
fact
:
it
wo
n't
do
at
all

<EOS>
It
's
natural
enough
that
you
should
think
about
it
,
associating
it
with
all
these
familiar
things
;
but
it
wo
n't
do
,
it
wo
n't
do

"
  
<EOS>
Solomon
Gills
rubbed
his
hands
with
an
air
of
stealthy
enjoyment
,
as
he
talked
of
the
sea
,
though
;
and
looked
on
the
sea
-
faring
objects
about
him
with
inexpressible
complacency
.
  
<EOS>
"
Think
of
this
wine
for
instance
,
"
said
old
Sol
,
"
which
has
been
to
the
East
Indies
and
back
<EOS>
,
I
'm
not
able
to
say
how
often
,
and
has
been
once
round
the
world
.
<EOS>
Think
of
the
pitch
-
dark
nights
,
the
roaring
winds
,
and
rolling
seas
:
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
thunder
,
lightning
,
rain
,
hail
,
storm
of
all
kinds
,
"
said
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
said
Solomon
,
---
"
that
this
wine
has
passed
through
.
<EOS>
Think
what
a
straining
and
creaking
of
timbers
and
masts
:
<EOS>
what
a
whistling
and
howling
of
the
gale
through
ropes
and
rigging
:
"
  
"
<EOS>
What
a
clambering
aloft
of
men
,
vying
with
each
other
who
shall
lie
out
first
upon
the
yards
to
furl
the
icy
sails
,
while
the
ship
rolls
and
pitches
,
like
mad
!
"
cried
his
nephew
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Exactly
so
,
"
said
Solomon
:
"
has
gone
on
,
over
the
old
cask
that
held
this
wine
.
<EOS>
Why
,
when
the
charming
Sally
went
down
in
the
---
"
  
"
In
the
Baltic
Sea
,
in
the
dead
of
the
night
;
five
-
and
-
twenty
minutes
past
twelve
when
the
captain
's
watch
stopped
in
his
pocket
;
he
lying
dead
against
the
main
-
mast
---
on
the
fourteenth
of
February
,
seventeen
forty
-
nine

"
<EOS>
cried
Walter
,
with
great
animation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
to
be
sure
!
"
<EOS>
cried
old
Sol
,
"
quite
right
!
<EOS>
Then
,
there
were
five
hundred
casks
of
such
wine
aboard
;
and
all
hands
(
except
the
first
mate
,
first
lieutenant
,
two
seamen
,
and
a
lady
,
in
a
leaky
boat
)
going
to
work
to
stave
the
casks
,
got
drunk
and
died
drunk
,
singing
,
"
Rule
Britannia
,
"
when
she
settled
and
went
down
,
and
ending
with
one
awful
scream
in
chorus
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
But
when
the
George
the
Second
drove
ashore
,
uncle
,
on
the
coast
of
Cornwall
,
in
a
dismal
gale
,
two
hours
before
daybreak
,
on
the
fourth
of
March
,
"
seventy
-
one
,
she
had
near
two
hundred
horses
aboard
;
and
the
horses
breaking
loose
down
below
,
early
in
the
gale
,
and
tearing
to
and
fro
,
and
trampling
each
other
to
death
,
made
such
noises
,
and
set
up
such
human
cries
,
that
the
crew
believing
the
ship
to
be
full
of
devils
,
some
of
the
best
men
,
losing
heart
and
head
,
went
overboard
in
despair
,
and
only
two
were
left
alive
,
at
last
,
to
tell
the
tale
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
when
,
"
said
old
Sol
,
"
when
the
Polyphemus

Private
West
India

burden
three
hundred
and
fifty
tons
,
Captain

John
Brown

.
<EOS>
Owners

Wiggs
and

"
cried
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
same
,
"
said
Sol
;
"
when
she
took
fire
,
four
days
'
sail
with
a
fair
wind
out
of
Jamaica
Harbour
,
in
the
night
---
"
  
"
There
were
two
brothers
on
board
,
"
interposed
his
nephew
,
speaking
very
fast
and
loud
,
"
and
there
not
being
room
for
both
of
them
in
the
only
boat
that
was
n't
swamped
,
neither
of
them
would
consent
to
go
,
until
the
elder
took
the
younger
by
the
waist
and
flung
him
in
.
<EOS>
And
then
the
younger
rising
in
the
boat
,
cried
out
,
"
Dear
Edward
,
think
of
your
promised
wife
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
'm
only
a
boy
.
<EOS>
No
one
waits
at
home
for
me
.
<EOS>
Leap
down
into
my
place
!
"
and
flung
himself
in
the
sea
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
kindling
eye
and
heightened
colour
of
the
boy
,
who
had
risen
from
his
seat
in
the
earnestness
of
what
he
said
and
felt
,
seemed
to
remind
old
Sol
of
something
he
had
forgotten
,
or
that
his
encircling
mist
had
hitherto
shut
out
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
proceeding
with
any
more
anecdotes
,
as
he
had
evidently
intended
but
a
moment
before
,
he
gave
a
short
dry
cough
,
and
said
,
"
Well
!
suppose
we
change
the
subject
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
truth
was
,
that
the
simple
-
minded
uncle
in
his
secret
attraction
towards
the
marvellous
and
adventurous
---
of
which
he
was
,
in
some
sort
,
a
distant
relation
,
by
his
trade
---
had
greatly
encouraged
the
same
attraction
in
the
nephew
;
and
that
everything
that
had
ever
been
put
before
the
boy
to
deter
him
from
a
life
of
adventure
,
had
had
the
usual
unaccountable
effect
of
sharpening
his
taste
for
it
.
<EOS>
This
is
invariable
.
<EOS>
It
would
seem
as
if
there
never
was
a
book
written
,
or
a
story
told
,
expressly
with
the
object
of
keeping
boys
on
shore
,
which
did
not
lure
and
charm
them
to
the
ocean
,
as
a
matter
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
But
an
addition
to
the
little
party
now
made
its
appearance
,
in
the
shape
of
a
gentleman
in
a
wide
suit
of
blue
,
with
a
hook
instead
of
a
hand
attached
to
his
right
wrist
;
very
bushy
black
eyebrows
;
and
a
thick
stick
in
his
left
hand
,
covered
all
over
(
like
his
nose
)
with
knobs
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
loose
black
silk
handkerchief
round
his
neck
,
and
such
a
very
large
coarse
shirt
collar
,
that
it
looked
like
a
small
sail
.
<EOS>
He
was
evidently
the
person
for
whom
the
spare
wine
-
glass
was
intended
,
and
evidently
knew
it
;
for
having
taken
off
his
rough
outer
coat
,
and
hung
up
,
on
a
particular
pet
behind
the
door
,
such
a
hard
glazed
hat
as
a
sympathetic
person
's
head
might
ache
at
the
sight
of
,
and
which
left
a
red
rim
round
his
own
forehead
as
if
he
had
been
wearing
a
tight
basin
,
he
brought
a
chair
to
where
the
clean
glass
was
,
and
sat
himself
down
behind
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
usually
addressed
as
Captain
,
this
visitor
;
and
had
been
a
pilot
,
or
a
skipper
,
or
a
privateers
-
man
,
or
all
three
perhaps
;
and
was
a
very
salt
-
looking
man
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
His
face
,
remarkable
for
a
brown
solidity
,
brightened
as
he
shook
hands
with
uncle
and
nephew
;
but
he
seemed
to
be
of
a
laconic
disposition
,
and
merely
said
:
  
"
How
goes
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
well
,
"
said
Mr
Gills
,
pushing
the
bottle
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
it
up
,
and
having
surveyed
and
smelt
it
,
said
with
extraordinary
expression
:
  
"
<EOS>
The
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
,
"
returned
the
Instrument
-
maker
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
that
he
whistled
as
he
filled
his
glass
,
and
seemed
to
think
they
were
making
holiday
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wal'r
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
arranging
his
hair
(
which
was
thin
)
with
his
hook
,
and
then
pointing
it
at
the
Instrument
-
maker
,
"
Look
at
him
!
<EOS>
Love
!
<EOS>
Honour
!
<EOS>
And
Obey
!
<EOS>
Overhaul
your
catechism
till
you
find
that
passage
,
and
when
found
turn
the
leaf
down
.
<EOS>
Success
,
my
boy
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
so
perfectly
satisfied
both
with
his
quotation
and
his
reference
to
it
,
that
he
could
not
help
repeating
the
words
again
in
a
low
voice
,
and
saying
he
had
forgotten
'em
these
forty
year
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
never
wanted
two
or
three
words
in
my
life
that
I
did
n't
know
where
to
lay
my
hand
upon
'em
,
Gills
,
"
he
observed
.
<EOS>
"
It
comes
of
not
wasting
language
as
some
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
reflection
perhaps
reminded
him
that
he
had
better
,
like
young
Norval
's
father
,
"
increase
his
store
.
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
he
became
silent
,
and
remained
so
,
until
old
Sol
went
out
into
the
shop
to
light
it
up
,
when
he
turned
to
Walter
,
and
said
,
without
any
introductory
remark
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
could
make
a
clock
if
he
tried
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
wonder
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
returned
the
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
it
would
go
!
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
,
making
a
species
of
serpent
in
the
air
with
his
hook
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lord
,
how
that
clock
would
go
!
"
  
<EOS>
For
a
moment
or
two
he
seemed
quite
lost
in
contemplating
the
pace
of
this
ideal
timepiece
,
and
sat
looking
at
the
boy
as
if
his
face
were
the
dial
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
's
chockfull
of
science
,
"
he
observed
,
waving
his
hook
towards
the
stock
-
in
-
trade
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Look'ye
here
!
<EOS>
Here
's
a
collection
of
'em
.
<EOS>
Earth
,
air
,
or
water
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
one
.
<EOS>
Only
say
where
you
'll
have
it
.
<EOS>
Up
in
a
balloon
?
<EOS>
There
you
are
.
<EOS>
Down
in
a
bell
?
<EOS>
There
you
are
.
<EOS>
D'ye
want
to
put
the
North
Star
in
a
pair
of
scales
and
weigh
it
?
<EOS>
He
'll
do
it
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
gathered
from
these
remarks
that
Captain
Cuttle
's
reverence
for
the
stock
of
instruments
was
profound
,
and
that
his
philosophy
knew
little
or
no
distinction
between
trading
in
it
and
inventing
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
with
a
sigh
,
"
it
's
a
fine
thing
to
understand
'em
.
<EOS>
And
yet
it
's
a
fine
thing
not
to
understand
'em
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
which
is
best
.
<EOS>
It
's
so
comfortable
to
sit
here
and
feel
that
you
might
be
weighed
,
measured
,
magnified
,
electrified
,
polarized
,
played
the
very
devil
with
:
and
never
know
how
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Nothing
short
of
the
wonderful
Madeira
,
combined
with
the
occasion
(
which
rendered
it
desirable
to
improve
and
expand
Walter
's
mind
)
,
could
have
ever
loosened
his
tongue
to
the
extent
of
giving
utterance
to
this
prodigious
oration
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
quite
amazed
himself
at
the
manner
in
which
it
opened
up
to
view
the
sources
of
the
taciturn
delight
,
he
had
had
in
eating
Sunday
dinners
in
that
parlour
for
ten
years
.
<EOS>
Becoming
a
sadder
and
a
wiser
man
,
he
mused
and
held
his
peace
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
cried
the
subject
of
his
admiration
,
returning
.
<EOS>
"
Before
you
have
your
glass
of
grog

Ned

we
must
finish

filling
his

Yes

said

more

<EOS>
We

Walter

Why

Some
of

talking

day

they
do

Uncle

Captain

lowering
his
voice

that
he
's
taken
a
dislike
to
her

that
she
's
left

unnoticed

among
the
servants

and
that
his
mind
's
so
set
all
the
while
upon
having
his
son
in
the
House
,
that
although
he
's
only
a
baby
now
,
he
is
going
to
have
balances
struck
oftener
than
formerly
,
and
the
books
kept
closer
than
they
used
to
be
,
and
has
even
been
seen
(
when
he
thought
he
was
n't
)
walking
in
the
Docks
,
looking
at
his
ships
and
property
and
all
that
,
as
if
he
was
exulting
like
,
over
what
he
and
his
son
will
possess
together

That
's
what
they
say

Of

I
do
n't
know

"
He

all

said
the
Instrumentmaker

the

still
reddening
and
laughing

<EOS>
LITTLE
Paul
,
suffering
no
contamination
,
from
the
blood
of
the
Toodles
,
grew
stouter
and
stronger
every
day
.
<EOS>
Every
day
,
too
,
he
was
more
and
more
ardently
cherished
by
Miss
Tox
,
whose
devotion
was
so
far
appreciated
by
Mr
Dombey
that
he
began
to
regard
her
as
a
woman
of
great
natural
good
sense
,
whose
feelings
did
her
credit
and
deserved
encouragement
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
lavish
of
this
condescension
,
that
he
not
only
bowed
to
her
,
in
a
particular
manner
,
on
several
occasions
,
but
even
entrusted
such
stately
recognitions
of
her
to
his
sister
as
"
pray
tell
your
friend
,
Louisa
,
that
she
is
very
good
,
"
or
"
mention
to
Miss
Tox
,
Louisa
,
that
I
am
obliged
to
her
;
"
specialities
which
made
a
deep
impression
on
the
lady
thus
distinguished
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
was
often
in
the
habit
of
assuring
Mrs
Chick
,
that
"
nothing
could
exceed
her
interest
in
all
connected
with
the
development
of
that
sweet
child
;
"
and
an
observer
of
Miss
Tox
's
proceedings
might
have
inferred
so
much
without
declaratory
confirmation
.
<EOS>
She
would
preside
over
the
innocent
repasts
of
the
young
heir
,
with
ineffable
satisfaction
,
almost
with
an
air
of
joint
proprietorship
with
Richards
in
the
entertainment
.
<EOS>
At
the
little
ceremonies
of
the
bath
and
toilette
,
she
assisted
with
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
The
administration
of
infantine
doses
of
physic
awakened
all
the
active
sympathy
of
her
character
;
and
being
on
one
occasion
secreted
in
a
cupboard
(
whither
she
had
fled
in
modesty
)
,
when
Mr
Dombey
was
introduced
into
the
nursery
by
his
sister
,
to
behold
his
son
,
in
the
course
of
preparation
for
bed
,
taking
a
short
walk
uphill
over
Richards
's
gown
,
in
a
short
and
airy
linen
jacket
,
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
was
so
transported
beyond
the
ignorant
present
as
to
be
unable
to
refrain
from
crying
out
,
"
<EOS>
Is
he
not
beautiful
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey!Is
he
not
a
Cupid
,
Sir
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
almost
sinking
behind
the
closet
door
with
confusion
and
blushes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Louisa
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
one
day
,
to
his
sister
,
"
<EOS>
I
really
think
I
must
present
your
friend
with
some
little
token
,
on
the
occasion
of
Paul
's
christening
.
<EOS>
She
has
exerted
herself
so
warmly
in
the
child
's
behalf
from
the
first
,
and
seems
to
understand
her
position
so
thoroughly
(
a
very
rare
merit
in
this
world
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
)
,
that
it
would
really
be
agreeable
to
me
to
notice
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Let
it
be
no
detraction
from
the
merits
of
Miss
Tox
,
to
hint
that
in
Mr
Dombey
's
eyes
,
as
in
some
others
that
occasionally
see
the
light
,
they
only
achieved
that
mighty
piece
of
knowledge
,
the
understanding
of
their
own
position
,
who
showed
a
fitting
reverence
for
his
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
so
much
their
merit
that
they
knew
themselves
,
as
that
they
knew
him
,
and
bowed
low
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Paul
,
"
returned
his
sister
,
"
you
do
Miss
Tox
but
justice
,
as
a
man
of
your
penetration
was
sure
,
I
knew
,
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
believe
if
there
are
three
words
in
the
English
language
for
which
she
has
a
respect
amounting
almost
to
veneration
,
those
words
are
,
Dombey
and
Son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
I
believe
it
.
<EOS>
It
does
Miss
Tox
credit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
as
to
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
token
,
my
dear
Paul
,
"
pursued
his
sister
,
"
<EOS>
all
I
can
say
is
that
anything
you
give
Miss
Tox
will
be
hoarded
and
prized
,
I
am
sure
,
like
a
relic
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
a
way
,
my
dear
Paul
,
of
showing
your
sense
of
Miss
Tox
's
friendliness
in
a
still
more
flattering
and
acceptable
manner
,
if
you
should
be
so
inclined
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
that
?
"
asked
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Godfathers
,
of
course
,
"
continued
Mrs
Chick
,
"
are
important
in
point
of
connexion
and
influence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
why
they
should
be
,
to
my
son
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
coldly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
my
dear
Paul
,
"
retorted
Mrs
Chick
,
with
an
extraordinary
show
of
animation
,
to
cover
the
suddenness
of
her
conversion
;
"
and
spoken
like
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
expected
nothing
else
from
you
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
known
that
such
would
have
been
your
opinion
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
;
"
here
Mrs
Chick
flattered
again
,
as
not
quite
comfortably
feeling
her
way
;
"
perhaps
that
is
a
reason
why
you
might
have
the
less
objection
to
allowing
Miss
Tox
to
be
godmother
to
the
dear
thing
,
if
it
were
only
as
deputy
and
proxy
for
some
one
else
.
<EOS>
That
it
would
be
received
as
a
great
honour
and
distinction
,
Paul
,
I
need
not
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Louisa
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
after
a
short
pause
,
"
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
not
,
"
cried
Mrs
Chick
,
hastening
to
anticipate
a
refusal
,
"
I
never
thought
it
was
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
looked
at
her
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
flurry
me
,
my
dear
Paul
,
"
said
his
sister
;
"
for
that
destroys
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
far
from
strong
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
quite
myself
,
since
poor
dear
Fanny
departed
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
glanced
at
the
pocket
-
handkerchief
which
his
sister
applied
to
her
eyes
,
and
resumed
:
  
"
It
is
not
to
be
supposed
,
I
say
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
I
say
,
"
murmured
Mrs
Chick
,
"
that
I
never
thought
it
was
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
Heaven
,
Louisa
!
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
Paul
,
"
she
remonstrated
with
tearful
dignity
,
"
I
must
really
be
allowed
to
speak
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
so
clever
,
or
so
reasoning
,
or
so
eloquent
,
or
so
anything
,
as
you
are
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
very
well
.
<EOS>
So
much
the
worse
for
me
.
<EOS>
But
if
they
were
the
last
words
.
<EOS>
I
had
to
utter
---
and
last
words
should
be
very
solemn
to
you
and
me
,
Paul
,
after
poor
dear
Fanny
<EOS>
---
I
should
still
say
I
never
thought
it
was
.
<EOS>
And
what
is
more
,
"
added
Mrs
Chick
with
increased
dignity
,
as
if
she
had
withheld
her
crushing
argument
until
now
,
"
I
never
did
think
it
was
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
walked
to
the
window
and
back
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
to
be
supposed
,
Louisa
,
"
he
said
(
Mrs
Chick
had
nailed
her
colours
to
the
mast
,
and
repeated
"
I
know
it
is
n't
,
"
but
he
took
no
notice
of
it
)
,
"
but
that
there
are
many
persons
who
,
supposing
that
I
recognised
any
claim
at
all
in
such
a
case
,
have
a
claim
upon
me
superior
to
Miss
Tox
's
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
I
recognise
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
Paul
and
myself
will
be
able
,
when
the
time
comes
,
to
hold
our
own
---
the
house
,
in
other
words
,
will
be
able
to
hold
its
own
,
and
maintain
its
own
,
and
hand
down
its
own
of
itself
,
and
without
any
such
common
-
place
aids
.
<EOS>
The
kind
of
foreign
help
which
people
usually
seek
for
their
children
,
I
can
afford
to
despise
;
being
above
it
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
So
that
Paul
's
infancy
and
childhood
pass
away
well
,
and
<EOS>
I
see
him
becoming
qualified
without
waste
of
time
for
the
career
on
which
he
is
destined
to
enter
,
I
am
satisfied
.
<EOS>
He
will
make
what
powerful
friends
he
pleases
in
after
-
life
,
when
he
is
actively
maintaining
---
and
extending
,
if
that
is
possible
---
the
dignity
and
credit
of
the
Firm
.
<EOS>
Until
then
,
I
am
enough
for
him
,
perhaps
,
and
all
in
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
wish
that
people
should
step
in
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
would
much
rather
show
my
sense
of
the
obliging
conduct
of
a
deserving
person
like
your
friend
.
<EOS>
Therefore
let
it
be
so
;
and
your
husband
and
myself
will
do
well
enough
for
the
other
sponsors
,
I
dare
say
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
these
remarks
,
delivered
with
great
majesty
and
grandeur
,
Mr
Dombey
had
truly
revealed
the
secret
feelings
of
his
breast
.
<EOS>
An
indescribable
distrust
of
anybody
stepping
in
between
himself
and
his
son
;
a
haughty
dread
of
having
any
rival
or
partner
in
the
boy
's
respect
and
deference
;
a
sharp
misgiving
,
recently
acquired
,
that
he
was
not
infallible
in
his
power
of
bending
and
binding
human
wills
;
as
sharp
a
jealousy
of
any
second
check
or
cross
;
these
were
,
at
that
time
,
the
master
keys
of
his
soul
.
<EOS>
In
all
his
life
,
he
had
never
made
a
friend
.
<EOS>
His
cold
and
distant
nature
had
neither
sought
one
nor
found
one
.
<EOS>
And
now
when
that
nature
concentrated
its
whole
force
so
strongly
on
a
partial
scheme
of
parental
interest
and
ambition
,
it
seemed
as
if
its
icy
current
,
instead
of
being
released
by
this
influence
,
and
running
clear
and
free
,
had
thawed
for
but
an
instant
to
admit
its
burden
,
and
then
frozen
with
it
into
one
unyielding
block
.
  
<EOS>
Elevated
thus
to
the
godmothership
of
little
Paul
,
<EOS>
in
virtue
of
her
insignificance
,
Miss
Tox
was
from
that
hour
chosen
and
appointed
to
office
;
and
Mr
Dombey
further
signified
his
pleasure
that
the
ceremony
,
already
long
delayed
,
should
take
place
without
further
postponement
.
<EOS>
His
sister
,
who
had
been
far
from
anticipating
so
signal
a
success
,
withdrew
as
soon
as
she
could
,
to
communicate
it
to
her
best
of
friends
;
and
Mr
Dombey
was
left
alone
in
his
library
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
anything
but
solitude
in
the
nursery
;
for
there
,
Mrs
Chick
and
Miss
Tox
were
enjoying
a
social
evening
,
so
much
to
the
disgust
of
Miss
Susan
Nipper
,
that
that
young
lady
embraced
every
opportunity
of
making
wry
faces
behind
the
door
.
<EOS>
Her
feelings
were
so
much
excited
on
the
occasion
,
that
she
found
it
indispensable
to
afford
them
this
relief
,
even
without
having
the
comfort
of
any
audience
or
sympathy
whatever
.
<EOS>
As
the
knight
-
errants
of
old
relieved
their
minds
by
carving
their
mistress
's
names
in
deserts
,
and
wildernesses
,
and
other
savage
places
where
there
was
no
probability
of
there
ever
being
anybody
to
red
them
,
so
did
Miss
Susan
Nipper
curl
her
snub
nose
into
drawers
and
wardrobes
,
put
away
winks
of
disparagement
in
cupboards
,
shed
derisive
squints
into
stone
pitchers
,
and
contradict
and
call
names
out
in
the
passage
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
interlopers
,
however
,
blissfully
unconscious
of
the
young
lady
's
sentiments
,
saw
little
Paul
safe
through
all
the
stages
of
undressing
,
airy
exercise
,
supper
and
bed
;
and
then
sat
down
to
tea
before
the
fire
.
<EOS>
The
two
children
now
lay
,
through
the
good
offices
of
Polly
,
in
one
room
;
and
it
was
not
until
the
ladies
were
established
at
their
tea
-
table
that
happening
to
look
towards
the
little
beds
<EOS>
,
they
thought
of
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
sound
she
sleeps
!
"
said
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
know
,
my
dear
,
she
takes
a
great
deal
of
exercise
in
the
course
of
the
day
,
"
returned
Mrs
Chicks
,
"
playing
about
little
Paul
so
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
curious
child
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
retorted
Mrs
Chick
,
in
a
low
voice
:
"
Her
mama
,
all
over
!
"
  
"
Indeed
!
"
said
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
dear
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
tone
of
most
extraordinary
compassion
Miss
Tox
said
it
in
,
though
she
had
no
distinct
idea
<EOS>
why
,
except
that
it
was
expected
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Florence
will
never
,
never
,
never
,
be
a
Dombey
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
"
not
if
she
lives
to
be
a
thousand
years
old
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
elevated
her
eyebrows
,
and
was
again
full
of
commiseration
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
quite
fret
and
worry
myself
about
her
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
with
a
sigh
of
modest
merit
.
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
n't
see
what
is
to
become
of
her
when
she
grows
older
,
or
what
position
she
is
to
take
.
<EOS>
She
do
n't
gain
on
her
papa
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
How
can
one
expect
she
should
,
when
she
is
so
very
unlike
a
Dombey
?
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
looked
as
if
she
saw
no
way
out
of
such
a
cogent
argument
as
that
,
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
the
child
,
you
see
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
in
deep
confidence
,
"
has
poor
Fanny
's
nature
.
<EOS>
She
'll
never
make
an
effort
in
after
-
life
<EOS>
I
'll
venture
to
say
.
<EOS>
Never
!
<EOS>
she
'll
never
wind
and
twine
herself
about
her
papa
's
heart
like

Like

suggested
Miss
Tox

Never

Mrs

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Never

<EOS>
Poor
Fanny

<EOS>
Yet

how
I
loved
her

<EOS>
"
You
must
not
distress
yourself

my

said
Miss

in
a
soothing
voice

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
really
!
<EOS>
You
have
too
much
feeling

We
have
all
our

Mrs

,
weeping
and
shaking
her
head

I
dare
say
we

I
never

What
a
satisfaction
it
was
to
Mrs
Chick
---
a
common
-
place
piece
of
<EOS>
folly
enough
,
compared
with
whom
her
sister
-
in
-
law
had
been
a
very
angel
of
womanly
intelligence
and
gentleness
---
to
patronise
and
be
tender
to
the
memory
of
that
lady
:
in
exact
pursuance
of
her
conduct
to
her
in
her
lifetime
:
and
to
thoroughly
believe
herself
,
and
take
herself
in
and
make
herself
uncommonly
comfortable
on
the
strength
of
her
toleration!What
a
mighty
pleasant
virtue
toleration
should
be
when
we
are
right
,
to
be
so
very
pleasant
when
we
are
wrong
,
and
quite
unable
to
demonstrate
how
we
come
to
be
invested
with
the
privilege
of
exercising
it
!
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
was
yet
drying
her
eyes
and
shaking
her
head
,
when
Richards
made
bold
to
caution
her
that
Miss
Florence
was
awake
and
sitting
in
her
bed
.
<EOS>
She
had
risen
,
as
the
nurse
said
,
and
the
lashes
of
her
eyes
were
wet
with
tears
.
<EOS>
But
no
one
saw
them
glistening
save
Polly
.
<EOS>
No
one
else
leant
over
her
,
and
whispered
soothing
words
to
her
,
or
was
near
enough
to
hear
the
flutter
of
her
beating
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
nurse
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
child
,
looking
earnestly
up
in
her
face
,
"
let
me
lie
by
my
brother
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
pet
?
"
said
Richards
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
think
he
loves
me
,
"
cried
the
child
wildly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
me
lie
by
him
.
<EOS>
Pray
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
interposed
with
some
motherly
words
about
going
to
sleep
like
a
dear
,
but
Florence
repeated
her
supplication
,
with
a
frightened
look
,
and
in
a
voice
broken
by
sobs
and
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
wake
him
,
"
she
said
,
covering
her
face
and
hanging
down
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
only
touch
him
with
my
hand
,
and
go
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
pray
,
pray
,
let
me
lie
by
my
brother
to
-
night
,
for
I
believe
he
's
fond
of
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
Richards
took
her
without
a
word
,
and
carrying
her
to
the
little
bed
in
which
the
infant
was
sleeping
,
laid
her
down
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
She
crept
as
near
him
as
she
could
without
disturbing
his
rest
;
and
stretching
out
one
arm
so
that
it
timidly
embraced
his
neck
,
and
hiding
her
face
on
the
other
,
over
which
her
damp
and
scattered
hair
fell
loose
,
lay
motionless
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
little
thing
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
;
"
she
has
been
dreaming
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
This
trivial
incident
had
so
interrupted
the
current
of
conversation
,
that
it
was
difficult
of
resumption
;
and
Mrs
Chick
moreover
had
been
so
affected
by
the
contemplation
of
her
own
tolerant
nature
,
that
she
was
not
in
spirits
.
<EOS>
The
two
friends
accordingly
soon
made
an
end
of
their
tea
,
and
a
servant
was
despatched
to
fetch
a
hackney
cabriolet
for
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
had
great
experience
in
hackney
cabs
,
and
her
starting
in
one
was
generally
work
of
time
,
as
she
was
systematic
in
the
preparatory
arrangements
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
the
goodness
,
if
you
please
,
Towlinson
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
"
first
of
all

to
carry
out
a
pen

ink
and
take
his

legibly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes

Miss

said
Towlinson

<EOS>
"
Then

Towlinson

Miss

have
the

turn
the

<EOS>
Which

said
Miss

apart
to
Mrs

<EOS>
"
Yes

Miss

said
Towlinson
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

trouble
you
also
,
if

said
Miss
Tox
,
"
with
this
card
and
this
shilling

<EOS>
He
's
to
drive
to
the
card
,
and
is
to
understand
that
he
will
not
on
any
account
have
more

the
shilling

<EOS>
"
  
"
No

Miss

"
said
Towlinson
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
---
I
'm
sorry
to
give
you
so
much
trouble
,
Towlinson

said
Miss
Tox
,
looking
at
him
pensively
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
Miss
,
"
said
Towlinson
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mention
to
the
man
,
then
,
if
you
please
,
Towlinson
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
"
That
the
lady
's
uncle
is
a
magistrate
,
and
that
if
he
gives
her
any
of
his
impertinence
he
will
be
punished
terribly
.
<EOS>
You
can
pretend
to
say
that
,
if
you
please
,
Towlinson
,
in
a
friendly
way
,
and
because
you
know
it
was
done
to
another
man
,
who
died
.
"
  
"
Certainly
,
Miss

"
said
Towlinson
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
good
night
to
my
sweet
,
sweet
,
sweet
,
godson
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
with
a
soft
shower
of
kisses
at
each
repetition
of
the
adjective
;
"
and
Louisa
,
my
dear
friend
,
promise
me
to
take
a
little
something
warm
before
you
go
to
bed

and
not

distress
yourself

<EOS>

<EOS>
It
was
with
extreme
difficulty
that
Nipper
,
the
black
-
eyed
,
who
looked
on
steadfastly
,
contained
herself
at
this
crisis
,
and
,
until
the
subsequent
departure
of
Mrs
Chick
.
<EOS>
But
the
nursery
being
at
length
free
of
visitors
,
she
made
herself
some
recompense
for
her
late
restraint
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
keep
me
in
a
strait
-
waistcoat
for
six
weeks
,
"
said
Nipper
,
"
and
when
I
got
it
off
<EOS>
I

only
be
more
aggravated

who

And

Polly

<EOS>
"
Oh

cried
Susan
Nipper
,
affecting
to
salute
the
door
by
which
the
ladies
had
departed
.
<EOS>
"
Never

Do

<EOS>
"
I

beholden

said
Susan

who
was
not
by
any
means
discriminating
in
her
wrath

A

may
tell
a
person
to
dive
off
a
bridge
head
foremost
into
five

and
-
forty
feet
of
water

Mrs

a

be
very
far
from
diving

<EOS>
"
There
now

said
Polly

you

angry

round
on
me

It

very

keep
their
tempers

be
soft

spoken

Mrs
Richards

returned
Susan
,
slightly
mollified
,
"
When
their
child
's
made
as
much
of
as
a
prince
,
and
is
petted
and
patted
till
it
wishes
its
friends
further

but
when
a
sweet
young
pretty
innocent
,
that
never
ought
to
have
a
cross
word
spoken
to

of
it

is

is
very

My

you
naughty

sinful
child

if

your

call

hobgoblins

<EOS>
Here
Miss
Nipper
made
a
horrible
lowing
,
supposed
to
issue
from
a
conscientious
goblin
of
the
bull
species
,
impatient
to
discharge
the
severe
duty
of
his
position
.
<EOS>
Having
further
composed
her
young
charge
by
covering
her
head
with
the
bed
-
clothes
,
and
making
three
or
four
angry
dabs
at
the
pillow
,
she
folded
her
arms
,
and
screwed
up
her
mouth
,
and
sat
looking
at
the
fire
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Though
little
Paul
was
said
,
in
nursery
phrase
,
"
to
take
a
deal
of
notice
for
his
age
,
"
he
took
as
little
notice
of
all
this
as
of
the
preparations
for
his
christening
on
the
next
day
but
one
;
which
nevertheless
went
on
about
him
,
as
to
his
personal
apparel
,
and
that
of
his
sister
and
the
two
nurses
,
with
great
activity
.
<EOS>
Neither
did
he
,
on
the
arrival
of
the
appointed
morning
,
show
any
sense
of
its
importance
;
being
,
on
the
contrary
,
unusually
inclined
to
sleep
,
and
unusually
inclined
to
take
it
ill
in
his
attendants
that
they
dressed
him
to
go
out
.
  
<EOS>
It
happened
to
be
an
iron
-
grey
autumnal
day
,
with
a
shrewd
east
wind
blowing
---
a
day
in
keeping
with
the
proceedings
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
represented
in
himself
the
wind
,
the
shade
,
and
the
autumn
of
the
christening
.
<EOS>
He
stood
in
his
library
to
receive
the
company
,
as
hard
land
cold
as
the
weather
;
and
when
he
looked
out
through
the
glass
room
,
at
came
fluttering
down
,
as
if
he
blighted
them
.
   
<EOS>
Ugh
!
<EOS>
They
were
black
,
cold
rooms
;
and
seemed
to
be
in
mourning
,
like
the
inmates
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
books
precisely
matched
as
to
size
,
and
drawn
up
in
line
,
like
soldiers
,
looked
in
their
cold
,
hard
,
slippery
uniforms
,
as
if
they
had
but
one
idea
among
them
,
and
that
was
a
freezer
.
<EOS>
The
bookcase
,
glazed
and
locked
,
repudiated
all
familiarities
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pitt
,
in
bronze
on
the
top
with
no
trace
of
his
celestial
origin
about
him
,
guarded
the
unattainable
treasure
like
an
enchanted
Moor
.
<EOS>
A
dusty
urn
at
each
high
corner
,
dug
up
from
an
ancient
tomb
,
preached
desolation
and
decay
,
as
from
two
pulpits
;
and
the
chimmey
-
glass
,
reflecting
Mr
Dombey
and
his
portrait
at
one
blow
,
seemed
fraught
with
melancholy
meditations
.
  
<EOS>
The
stiff
and
stark
fire
-
irons
appeared
to
claim
a
nearer
relationship
than
anything
else
there
to
Mr
Dombey
,
with
his
buttoned
coat
,
his
white
cravat
,
is
heavy
gold
watch
-
chain
,
and
his
creaking
boots
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
before
the
arrival
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Chick
,
his
lawful
relatives
,
who
soon
presented
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Paul
,
"
Mrs
Chick
murmured
,
as
she
embraced
him
,
"
the
beginning
,
I
hope
,
of
many
joyful
days
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Louisa

said
Mr
Dombey
,
grimly
.
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Mr
John
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Sir

"
said
Chick
.
  
<EOS>
He
gave
Mr
Dombey
his
hand
,
as
if
he
feared
it
might
electrify
him
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
took
it
as
if
it
were
a
fish
,
or
seaweed
,
or
some
such
clammy
substance
,
and
immediately
returned
it
to
him
with
exalted
politeness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
Louisa
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
slightly
turning
his
head
in
his
cravat
,
as
if
it
were
a
socket
,
"
you
would
have
preferred
a
fire
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
Paul
,
no

said
Mrs
chick
,
who
had
much
ado
to
keep
her
teeth
from
chattering
;
"
not
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
John
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
you
are
not
sensible
of
any
chill

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
John
,
who
had
already
got
both
his
hands
in
his
pockets
over
the
wrists
,
and
was
on
the
very
threshold
of
that
same
canine
chorus
which
had
given
Mrs
Chick
so
much
offence
on
a
former
occasion
,
protested
that
he
was
perfectly
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
He
added
in
a
low
voice
,
"
With
my
tiddle
tol
toor

---
when
he
was
providentially
stopped
by
Towlinson
,
who
announced
:
  
"
Miss

<EOS>
And
enter
that
fair
enslaver
,
with
a
blue
nose
and
indescribably
frosty
face
,
referable
to
her
being
very
thinly
clad
in
a
maze
of
fluttering
odds
and
ends
,
to
do
honour
to
the
ceremony

<EOS>
"
How

said
Mr
Dombey

Miss
Tox
,
in
the
midst
of
her
spreading
gauzes
,
went
down
altogether
like
an
opera
-
glass
shutting
-
up
;
she
curtseyed
so
low
,
in
acknowledgment
of
Mr
Dombey
's
advancing
a
step
or
two
to
meet
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
never
forget
this
occasion
,
Sir
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
softly
.
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
impossible
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Louisa
,
I
can
hardly
believe
the
evidence
of
my
senses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
Miss
Tox
could
believe
the
evidence
of
one
of
her
senses
,
it
was
a
very
cold
day
.
<EOS>
That
was
quite
clear
.
<EOS>
She
took
an
early
opportunity
of
promoting
the
circulation
in
the
tip
of
her
nose
by
secretly
chafing
it
with
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
lest
,
by
its
very
low
temperature
,
it
should
disagreeably
astonish
the
baby
when
she
came
to
kiss
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
baby
soon
appeared
,
carried
in
great
glory
by
Richards
;
while
Florence
,
in
custody
of
that
active
young
constable
,
Susan
Nipper
,
brought
up
the
rear
.
<EOS>
Though
the
whole
nursery
party
were
dressed
by
this
time
in
lighter
mourning
than
at
first
,
there
was
enough
in
the
appearance
of
the
bereaved
children
to
make
the
day
no
brighter
.
<EOS>
The
baby
too
<EOS>
---
it
might
have
been
Miss
Tox
's
nose
---
began
to
cry
.
<EOS>
Thereby
,
as
it
happened
,
preventing
Mr
chick
from
the
awkward
fulfilment
of
a
very
honest
purpose
he
had
;
which
was
,
to
make
much
of
Florence
.
<EOS>
For
this
gentleman
,
insensible
to
the
superior
claims
of
a
perfect
Dombey
(
perhaps
on
account
of
having
the
honour
to
be
united
to
a
Dombey
himself
,
and
being
familiar
with
excellence
)
,
really
liked
her
,
and
showed
that
he
liked
her
,
and
was
about
to
show
it
in
his
own
way
now
,
when
Paul
cried
,
and
his
helpmate
stopped
him
short
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
Florence
,
child
!
"
said
her
aunt
,
briskly
,
"
what
are
you
doing
,
love
?
<EOS>
Show
yourself
to
him
.
<EOS>
Engage
his
attention
,
my
dear
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
atmosphere
became
or
might
have
become
colder
and
colder
,
when
Mr
Dombey
stood
frigidly
watching
his
little
daughter
,
who
,
clapping
her
hands
,
and
standing
on
tip
-
toe
before
the
throne
of
his
son
and
heir
,
lured
him
to
bend
down
from
his
high
estate
,
and
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
Some
honest
act
of
Richards
's
may
have
aided
the
effect
,
but
he
did
look
down
,
and
held
his
peace
.
<EOS>
As
his
sister
hid
behind
her
nurse
,
he
followed
her
with
his
eyes
;
and
when
she
peeped
out
with
a
merry
cry
to
him
,
he
sprang
up
and
crowed
lustily
---
laughing
outright
when
she
ran
in
upon
him
;
and
seeming
to
fondle
her
curls
with
his
tiny
hands
,
while
she
smothered
him
with
kisses
.
  
<EOS>
Was
Mr
Dombey
pleased
to
see
this
?
<EOS>
He
testified
no
pleasure
by
the
relaxation
of
a
nerve
;
but
outward
tokens
of
any
king
of
feeling
were
unusual
with
him
.
<EOS>
If
any
sunbeam
stole
into
the
room
to
light
the
children
at
their
play
,
it
never
reached
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
looked
on
so
fixedly
and
coldly
,
that
the
warm
light
vanished
even
from
the
laughing
eyes
of
little
Florence
,
when
,
at
last
,
they
happened
to
meet
his
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
dull
,
grey
,
autumn
day
indeed
,
and
in
a
minute
's
pause
and
silence
that
took
place
,
the
leaves
fell
sorrowfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
John
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
referring
to
his
watch
,
and
assuming
his
hat
and
gloves
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Take
my
sister
,
if
you
please
:
my
arm
to
-
day
is
Miss
Tox
's
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
go
first
with
Master
Paul
,
Richards
.
<EOS>
Be
very
careful
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
Mr
Dombey
's
carriage
,
Dombey
and
Son
,
Miss
Tox
,
Mrs
Chick
,
Richards
,
and
Florence
.
<EOS>
In
a
little
carriage
following
it
,
Susan
Nipper
and
the
owner
Mr
Chick
.
<EOS>
Susan
looking
out
of
window
,
without
intermission
,
as
a
relief
from
the
embarrassment
of
confronting
the
large
face
of
that
he
gentleman
,
and
thinking
whenever
anything
rattled
that
he
was
putting
up
in
paper
an
appropriate
pecuniary
compliment
for
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Once
upon
the
road
to
church
,
Mr
Dombey
clapped
his
hands
for
the
amusement
of
his
son
.
<EOS>
At
which
instance
of
parental
enthusiasm
Miss
Tox
was
enchanted
.
<EOS>
But
exclusive
of
this
incident
,
the
chief
difference
between
the
christening
party
and
a
party
in
a
mourning
coach
,
consisted
in
the
colours
of
the
carriage
and
horses
.
  
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
church
steps
,
they
were
received
by
a
portentous
beadle
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
dismounting
first
to
help
the
ladies
out
,
and
standing
near
him
at
the
church
door
,
looked
like
another
beadle
.
<EOS>
A
beadle
less
gorgeous
but
more
dreadful
;
the
beadle
of
private
life
;
the
beadle
of
our
business
and
our
bosoms
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
's
hand
trembled
as
she
slipped
it
through
Mr
Dombey
's
arm
,
and
felt
herself
escorted
up
the
steps
,
preceded
by
a
cocked
hat
and
a
Babylonian
collar
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
for
a
moment
like
that
other
solemn
institution
,
"
Wilt
thou
have
this
man
,
Lucretia
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Please
to
bring
the
child
in
quick
out
of
the
air
there
,
"
whispered
the
beadle
,
holding
open
the
inner
door
of
the
church
.
  
<EOS>
Little
Paul
might
have
asked
with
Hamlet
"
into
my
grave
?
"
<EOS>
so
chill
and
earthy
was
the
place
.
<EOS>
The
tall
shrouded
pulpit
and
reading
desk
;
the
dreary
perspective
of
empty
pews
stretching
away
under
the
galleries
,
and
empty
benches
mounting
to
the
roof
and
lost
in
the
shadow
of
the
great
grim
organ
;
the
dusty
matting
and
cold
stone
slabs
;
the
grisly
free
seats
in
the
aisles
;
and
the
damp
corner
by
the
bell
-
rope
,
where
the
black
trestles
used
for
funerals
were
stowed
away
,
along
with
some
shovels
and
baskets
,
and
a
coil
or
two
of
deadly
-
looking
rope
;
the
strange
,
unusual
,
uncomfortable
smell
,
and
the
cadaverous
light
;
were
all
in
unison
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
cold
and
dismal
scene
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
wedding
just
on
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
beadle
,
"
but
it
'll
be
over
directly
,
if
you
'll
walk
into
the
westry
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Before
he
turned
again
to
lead
the
way
,
he
gave
Mr
Dombey
a
bow
and
a
half
smile
of
recognition
,
importing
that
he
(
the
beadle
)
remembered
to
have
had
the
pleasure
of
attending
on
him
when
he
buried
his
wife
,
and
hoped
he
had
enjoyed
himself
since
.
  
<EOS>
The
very
wedding
looking
dismal
as
they
passed
in
front
of
the
altar
.
<EOS>
The
bride
was
too
old
and
the
bridegroom
too
young
,
and
a
superannuated
beau
with
one
eye
and
an
eye
-
glass
stuck
in
its
blank
companion
,
was
giving
away
the
lady
,
while
the
friends
were
shivering
.
<EOS>
In
the
vestry
the
fire
was
smoking
;
and
an
over
-
aged
and
over
-
worked
and
under
-
paid
attorney
's
clerk
,
"
making
a
search
,
"
was
running
his
forefinger
down
the
parchment
pages
of
an
immense
register
(
one
of
a
long
series
of
similar
volumes
)
gorged
with
burials
.
<EOS>
Over
the
fireplace
was
a
ground
-
plan
of
the
vaults
underneath
the
church
;
and
Mr
Chick
,
skimming
the
literary
portion
of
it
aloud
,
by
way
of
enlivening
the
company
,
read
the
reference
to
Mrs
Dombey
's
tomb
in
full
,
before
he
could
stop
himself
.
  
<EOS>
After
another
cold
interval
,
a
wheezy
little
pew
-
opener
afflicted
with
an
asthma
,
appropriate
to
the
churchyard
,
if
not
to
the
church
,
summoned
them
to
the
font
.
<EOS>
Here
they
waited
some
little
time
while
the
marriage
party
enrolled
themselves
;
and
meanwhile
the
wheezy
little
pew
-
opener
---
partly
in
consequence
of
her
infirmity
,
and
partly
that
the
marriage
party
might
not
forget
her
---
went
about
the
building
coughing
like
a
grampus
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
the
clerk
(
the
only
cheerful
-
looking
object
there
,
and
was
an
undertaker
)
came
up
with
a
jug
of
warm
water
,
and
said
something
,
as
he
poured
it
into
the
font
,
about
taking
the
chill
off
;
which
millions
of
gallons
boiling
hot
could
not
have
done
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Then
the
clergyman
,
an
amiable
and
mild
-
looking
young
curate
,
but
obviously
afraid
of
the
baby
,
appeared
like
the
principal
character
in
a
ghost
-
story
,
"
a
tall
figure
all
in
white
;
"
at
sight
of
whom
Paul
rent
the
air
with
his
cries
,
and
never
left
again
till
he
was
taken
out
black
in
the
face
.
  
<EOS>
Even
when
that
event
had
happened
,
to
the
great
relief
of
everybody
,
he
was
heard
under
the
portico
,
during
the
rest
of
the
ceremony
,
now
fainter
,
now
louder
,
now
hushed
,
now
bursting
forth
again
with
an
irrepressible
sense
of
his
wrongs
.
<EOS>
This
so
distracted
the
attention
of
the
two
ladies
,
that
Mrs
Chick
was
constantly
deploying
into
the
centre
aisle
,
to
send
out
messages
by
the
pew
-
opener
,
while
Miss
Tox
kept
her
Prayer
-
book
open
at
the
Gunpowder
Plot
,
and
occasionally
read
responses
from
that
service
.
  
<EOS>
During
the
whole
of
these
proceedings
,
Mr
Dombey
remained
as
impassive
and
gentlemanly
as
ever
,
and
perhaps
assisted
in
making
it
so
cold
,
that
the
young
curate
smoked
at
the
mouth
as
he
read
.
<EOS>
The
only
time
that
he
unbent
his
visage
in
the
least
,
was
when
the
clergyman
,
in
delivering
(
very
unaffectedly
and
simply
)
the
closing
exhortation
,
relative
to
the
future
examination
of
the
child
by
the
sponsors
,
happened
to
rest
his
eye
on
Mr
Chick
;
and
then
Mr
Dombey
might
have
been
seen
to
express
by
a
majestic
look
,
that
he
would
like
to
catch
him
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
well
for
Mr
Dombey
,
if
he
had
thought
of
his
own
dignity
a
little
less
;
and
had
thought
of
the
great
origin
and
purpose
of
the
ceremony
in
which
he
took
so
formal
and
so
stiff
<EOS>
a
part
,
a
little
more
.
<EOS>
His
arrogance
contrasted
strangely
with
its
history
.
  
<EOS>
When
it
was
all
over
,
he
again
gave
his
arm
to
Miss
Tox
,
and
conducted
her
to
the
vestry
,
where
he
informed
the
clergyman
how
much
pleasure
it
would
have
given
him
to
have
solicited
the
honour
of
his
company
at
dinner
,
but
for
the
unfortunate
state
of
his
household
affairs
.
<EOS>
The
register
signed
,
and
the
fees
paid
,
and
the
pew
-
opener
(
whose
cough
was
very
bad
again
)
remembered
,
and
the
beadle
gratified
,
and
the
sexton
(
who
was
accidentally
on
the
door
-
steps
,
looking
with
great
interest
at
the
weather
)
not
forgotten
,
they
got
into
the
carriage
again
,
and
drove
home
in
the
same
bleak
fellowship
.
  
<EOS>
There
they
found
Mr
Pitt
turning
up
his
nose
at
a
cold
collation
,
set
forth
in
a
cold
pomp
of
glass
and
silver
,
and
looking
more
like
a
dead
dinner
lying
in
state
than
a
social
refreshment
.
<EOS>
On
their
arrival
Miss
Tox
produced
a
mug
for
her
godson
,
and
Mr
Chick
a
knife
and
fork
and
spoon
in
a
case
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
also
produced
a
bracelet
for
Miss
Tox
;
and
,
on
the
receipt
of
this
token
,
Miss
Tox
was
tenderly
affected
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
John
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
will
you
take
the
bottom
of
the
table
,
if
you
please
?
<EOS>
What
have
you
got
there
,
Mr
John
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
got
a
cold
fillet
of
veal
here
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Chick
,
rubbing
his
numbed
hands
hard
together
.
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
got
there
,
Sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
returned
Mr
Dombey
,
"
is
some
cold
preparation
of
calf
's
head
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
I
see
cold
fowls
---
ham
---
patties
---
salad
---
lobster
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
will
do
me
the
honour
of
taking
some
wine
?
<EOS>
Champagne
to
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
toothache
in
everything
.
<EOS>
The
wine
was
so
bitter
cold
that
it
forced
a
little
scream
from
Miss
Tox
,
which
she
had
great
difficulty
in
turning
into
a
"
Hem
!
"
<EOS>
The
veal
had
come
from
such
an
airy
pantry
,
that
the
first
taste
of
it
had
struck
a
sensation
as
of
cold
lead
to
Mr
Chick
's
extremities
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
alone
remained
unmoved
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
been
hung
up
for
sale
at
a
Russian
fair
as
a
specimen
of
a
frozen
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
The
prevailing
influence
was
too
much
even
for
his
sister
.
<EOS>
She
made
no
effort
at
flattery
or
small
talk
,
and
directed
all
her
efforts
to
looking
as
warm
as
she
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Chick
,
making
a
desperate
plunge
,
after
a
long
silence
,
and
filling
a
glass
of
sherry
;
<EOS>
"
I
shall
drink
this
,
if
you
'll
allow
me
,
Sir
,
to
little
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
him
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
Miss
Tox
,
taking
a
sip
of
wine
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
little
Dombey
!
<EOS>
"
murmured
Mrs
Chick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
John
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
with
severe
gravity
,
"
my
son
would
feel
and
express
himself
obliged
to
you
,
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
,
if
he
could
appreciate
the
favour
you
have
done
him
.
<EOS>
He
will
prove
,
in
time
to
come
,
I
trust
,
equal
to
any
responsibility
that
the
obliging
disposition
of
his
relations
and
friends
,
in
private
,
or
the
onerous
nature
of
our
position
,
in
public
,
may
impose
upon
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
tone
in
which
this
was
said
admitting
of
nothing
more
<EOS>
,
Mr
Chick
relapsed
into
low
spirits
and
silence
.
<EOS>
Not
so
Miss
Tox
,
who
,
having
listened
to
Mr
Dombey
with
even
a
more
emphatic
attention
than
usual
,
and
with
a
more
expressive
tendency
of
her
head
to
one
side
,
now
leant
across
the
table
,
and
said
to
Mrs
Chick
softly
:
  
"
Louisa
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Onerous
nature
of
our
position
in
public

Expose

said
Mrs
Chick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
Miss
Tox
,
"
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
It
was
more
rounded
and
flowing
.
<EOS>
Obliging
disposition
of
relations

in
private

or
onerous
nature
of

impose
upon
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Impose
upon
him
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
tox
struck
her
delicate
hands
together
lightly
,
in
triumph
;
and
added
,
casting
up
her
eyes
,
"
eloquence
indeed
!

<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
had
issued
orders
for
the
attendance
of
Richards
,
who
now
entered
curtseying
,
but
without
the
baby
;
Paul
being
asleep
after
the
fatigues
of
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
having
delivered
a
glass
of
wine
to
this
vassal
,
addressed
her
in
the
following
words
:
Miss
Tox
previously
settling
her
head
on
one
side
,
and
making
other
little
arrangements
for
engraving
them
on
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
During
the
six
months
or
so
,
Richards
,
which
have
seen
you
an
inmate
of
this
house
,
you
have
done
your
duty
.
<EOS>
Desiring
to
connect
some
little
service
to
you
with
this
occasion
,
I
considered
how
I
could
best
effect
that
object
,
and
I
also
advised
with
my
sister
,
Mrs
---
"
  
"
Chick
,
"
interposed
the
gentleman
of
that
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
hush
if
you
please
!
"
said
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
about
to
say
to
you
,
Richards
,
"
resumed
Mr
Dombey
,
with
an
appalling
glance
at
Mr
John
,
"
that
I
was
further
assisted
in
my
decision
,
by
the
recollection
of
a
conversation
I
held
with
your
husband
in
this
room
,
on
the
occasion
of
your
being
hired
,
when
he
disclosed
to
me
the
melancholy
fact
that
your
family
,
himself
at
the
head
,
were
sunk
and
steeped
in
ignorance
.
"
  
<EOS>
Richards
quailed
under
the
magnificence
of
the
reproof
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
far
from
being
friendly
,
"
pursued
Mr
Dombey
,
"
to
what
is
called
by
persons
of
levelling
sentiments
,
general
education
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
necessary
that
the
inferior
classes
should
continue
to
be
taught
to
know
their
position
,
and
to
conduct
themselves
properly
.
<EOS>
So
far
I
approve
of
schools
.
<EOS>
Having
the
power
of
nominating
a
child
on
the
foundation
of
an
ancient
establishment
,
called
(
from
a
worshipful
company
)
<EOS>
the
Charitable
Grinders
;
where
not
only
is
a
wholesome
education
bestowed
upon
the
scholars
,
but
where
a
dress
and
badge
is
likewise
provided
for
them
;
I
have
(
first
communicating
,
through
Mrs
chick
,
with
your
family
)
nominated
your
eldest
son
to
an
existing
vacancy
;
and
he
has
this
day
,
I
am
informed
,
assumed
the
habit
.
<EOS>
The
number
of
her
son
,
I
believe
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
turning
to
his
sister
and
speaking
of
the
child
as
if
he
were
a
hackney
-
coach
,
"
is
one
hundred
and
forty
-
seven
.
<EOS>
Louisa
,
you
can
tell
her

"
  
<EOS>
"
One
hundred

seven

"
said
Mrs
Chick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
dress
,
Richards
,
is
a
nice
,
warm
,
blue
baize
tailed
coat
and
cap
,
turned
up
with
orange

coloured
binding
;
red
worsted

and
very
strong
leather
small

<EOS>
One

the

"
said
Mrs

,
with
enthusiasm
,
"
and
be
grateful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
Richards

"
said
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
indeed
,
you
may
be
proud
.
<EOS>
The
Charitable
Grinders
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
am
very
much
obliged
,
Sir
,
"
returned
Richards
faintly
,
"
and
take
it
very
kind
that
you
should
remember
my
little
ones
.
<EOS>
"
At
the
same
time
a
vision
of
Biler
as
a
charitable
Grinder
,
with
his
very
small
legs
encased
in
the
serviceable
clothing
described
by
Mrs
Chick
,
swam
before
Richards
's
eyes
,
and
made
them
water
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
have
so
much
feeling
,
Richards
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
makes
one
almost
hope
,
it
really
does
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
who
prided
herself
on
taking
trustful
views
of
human
nature
,
"
that
there
may
yet
be
some
faint
spark
of
gratitude
and
right
feeling
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Richards
deferred
to
these
compliments
by
curtseying
and
murmuring
her
thanks
;
but
finding
it
quite
impossible
to
recover
her
spirits
from
the
disorder
into
which
they
had
been
thrown
by
the
image
of
her
son
in
his
precocious
nether
garments
,
she
gradually
approached
the
door
and
was
heartily
relieved
to
escape
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
Such
temporary
indications
of
a
partial
thaw
that
had
appeared
with
her
,
vanished
with
her
;
and
the
frost
set
in
again
,
as
cold
and
hard
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Mr
Chick
was
twice
heard
to
hum
a
tune
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
,
but
on
both
occasions
it
was
a
fragment
of
the
Dead
March
in
Saul
.
<EOS>
The
party
seemed
to
get
colder
and
colder
,
and
to
be
gradually
resolving
itself
into
a
congealed
and
solid
state
,
like
the
collation
round
which
it
was
assembled
.
<EOS>
At
length
Mrs
Chick
looked
at
Miss
Tox
,
and
Miss
Tox
returned
the
look
,
and
they
both
rose
and
said
it
was
really
time
to
go
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
receiving
this
announcement
with
perfect
equanimity
<EOS>
,
they
took
leave
of
that
gentleman
,
and
presently
departed
under
the
protection
of
Mr
Chick
;
who
,
when
they
had
turned
their
backs
upon
the
house
and
left
its
master
in
his
usual
solitary
state
,
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
threw
himself
back
in
the
carriage
,
and
whistled
"
With
a
hey
ho
chevy
!
<EOS>
"
all
through
;
conveying
into
his
face
as
he
did
so
,
an
expression
of
such
gloomy
and
terrible
defiance
,
that
Mrs
Chick
dared
not
protest
,
or
in
any
way
molest
him
.
  
<EOS>
Richards
,
though
she
had
little
Paul
on
her
lap
,
could
not
forget
her
own
first
-
born
.
<EOS>
She
felt
it
was
ungrateful
;
but
the
influence
of
the
day
fell
even
on
the
Charitable
Grinders
,
and
she
could
hardly
help
regarding
his
pewter
badge
,
number
one
hundred
and
forty
-
seven
,
as
,
somehow
,
a
part
of
its
formality
and
sternness
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
,
too
,
in
the
nursery
,
of
his
"
blessed
legs
,
"
and
was
again
troubled
by
his
spectre
in
uniform
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
I
would
n't
give
,
"
said
Polly
,
"
to
see
the
poor
little
dear
before
he
gets
used
to
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
,
I
tell
you
what
,
Mrs
Richards
,
"
retorted
Nipper
,
who
had
been
admitted
to
her
confidence
,
"
see
him
and
make
your
mind
easy
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dombey
would
n't
like
it
,
"
said
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
would
n't
he
,
Mrs
Richards
!
"
retorted
Nipper
,
"
he
'd
like
it
very
much
,
I
think
,
when
he
was
asked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
ask
him
,
I
suppose
,
at
all
?
"
said
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mrs
Richards
,
quite
contrairy
,
"
returned
Susan
,
"
and
them
tow
inspectors
Tox
and
Chick
,
not
intending
to
be
on
duty
to
-
morrow
,
<EOS>
as
I
heard
'em
say
,
me
and
Miss
Floy
will
go
along
with
you
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
welcome
,
<EOS>
Mrs
Richards
,
if
you
like
,
for
we
may
as
well
walk
there
,
as
up
and
down
a
street
,
and
better
too
.
"
   
<EOS>
Polly
rejected
the
idea
pretty
stoutly
at
first
;
but
by
little
and
little
she
began
to
entertain
it
,
as
she
entertained
more
and
more
distinctly
the
forbidden
pictures
of
her
children
,
and
her
own
home
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
arguing
that
there
could
be
no
great
harm
in
calling
for
a
moment
at
the
door
,
she
yielded
to
the
Nipper
proposition
.
  
<EOS>
The
matter
being
settled
thus
,
little
Paul
began
to
cry
most
piteously
,
as
if
he
had
a
foreboding
that
no
good
would
come
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
with
the
child
?
"
asked
Susan
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
cold
,
I
think
,
"
said
Polly
,
walking
with
him
to
and
fro
,
and
hushing
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
bleak
autumnal
afternoon
indeed
;
and
as
she
walked
,
and
hushed
,
and
,
glancing
through
the
dreary
windown
,
pressed
the
little
fellow
closer
to
her
breast
,
the
withered
leaves
came
showering
down
.

<EOS>
Paul
's
Second
Deprivation
 
<EOS>
POLLY
was
beset
by
so
many
misgivings
in
the
morning
,
that
but
for
the
incessant
promptings
of
her
black
-
eyed
companion
,
she
would
have
abandoned
all
thoughts
of
the
expedition
,
and
formally
petitioned
for
leave
to
see
number
one
hundred
and
forty
-
seven
,
under
the
awful
shadow
of
Mr
Dombey
's
roof
.
<EOS>
But
Susan
who
was
personally
disposed
in
favour
of
the
excursion
,
and
who
(
like
Tony
Lumpkin
)
,
if
she
could
bear
the
disappointments
of
other
people
with
tolerable
fortitude
,
could
not
abide
to
disappoint
herself
,
threw
so
many
ingenious
doubts
in
the
way
of
this
second
thought
,
and
stimulated
the
original
intention
with
so
many
ingenious
arguments
,
that
almost
as
soon
as
Mr
Dombey
's
stately
back
was
turned
,
and
that
gentleman
was
pursuing
his
daily
road
towards
the
City
,
his
unconscious
son
was
on
his
way
to
Staggs
's
Gardens
.
  
<EOS>
This
euphonious
locality
was
situated
in
a
suburb
,
known
by
the
inhabitants
of
Staggs
's
Gardens
by
the
name
of
Camberling
Town
;
a
designation
which
the
Strangers
'
Map
of
London
,
as
printed
(
with
a
view
to
pleasant
and
commodious
reference
)
on
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
,
condenses
,
with
some
show
of
reason
,
into
Camden
Town
.
<EOS>
Hither
the
two
nurses
bent
their
steps
,
accompanied
by
their
charges
;
<EOS>
Richards
carrying
Paul
,
of
course
,
and
Susan
leading
little
Florence
by
the
hand
,
and
giving
her
such
jerks
and
pokes
from
time
to
time
,
as
she
considered
it
wholesome
to
administer
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
shock
of
a
great
earthquake
had
,
just
at
that
period
,
rent
the
whole
neighbourhood
to
its
centre
.
<EOS>
Traces
of
its
course
were
visible
on
every
side
.
<EOS>
Houses
were
knocked
down
;
streets
broken
through
and
stopped
;
deep
pits
and
trenches
dug
in
the
ground
;
enormous
heaps
of
earth
and
clay
thrown
up
;
buildings
that
were
undermined
and
shaking
,
propped
by
great
beams
of
wood
.
<EOS>
Here
,
a
chaos
of
carts
,
overthrown
and
jumbled
together
,
lay
topsy
-
turvy
at
the
bottom
of
a
steep
unnatural
hill
;
there
,
confused
treasures
of
iron
soaked
and
rusted
in
something
that
had
accidentally
become
a
pond
.
<EOS>
Everywhere
were
bridges
that
led
nowhere
;
thoroughfares
that
were
wholly
impassable
;
Babel
towers
of
chimneys
,
wanting
half
their
height
;
temporary
wooden
houses
and
enclosures
,
in
the
most
unlikely
situations
;
carcases
of
ragged
tenements
,
and
fragments
of
unfinished
walls
and
arches
,
and
piles
of
scaffolding
,
and
wildernesses
of
bricks
,
and
giant
forms
of
cranes
,
and
tripods
straddling
above
nothing
.
<EOS>
There
were
a
hundred
thousand
shapes
and
substances
of
incompleteness
,
wildly
mingled
out
of
their
places
,
upside
down
,
burrowing
in
the
earth
,
aspiring
in
the
air
,
mouldering
in
the
water
,
and
unintelligible
as
any
dream
.
<EOS>
Hot
springs
and
fiery
eruptions
,
the
usual
attendants
upon
earthquakes
,
lent
their
contributions
of
confusion
to
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Boiling
water
hissed
and
heaved
within
dilapidated
walls
;
whence
,
also
,
the
glare
and
roar
of
flames
came
issuing
forth
;
and
mounds
of
ashes
blocked
up
rights
of
way
,
and
wholly
changed
the
law
and
custom
of
the
neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
yet
unfinished
and
unopened
Railroad
was
in
progress
;
and
,
from
the
very
core
of
all
this
dire
disorder
,
trailed
smoothly
away
,
upon
its
mighty
course
of
civilisation
and
improvement
.
  
<EOS>
But
as
yet
,
the
neighbourhood
was
shy
to
own
the
Railroad
.
<EOS>
One
or
two
bold
speculators
had
projected
streets
;
and
one
had
built
a
little
,
but
had
stopped
among
the
mud
and
ashes
to
consider
farther
of
it
.
<EOS>
A
bran
-
new
Tavern
,
redolent
of
fresh
mortar
and
size
,
and
fronting
nothing
at
all
,
had
taken
for
its
sign
The
Railway
Arms
;
but
that
might
be
rash
enterprise
---
and
then
it
hoped
to
sell
drink
to
the
workmen
.
<EOS>
So
,
the
Excavators
'
House
of
Call
had
sprung
up
from
a
beer
-
shop
;
and
the
old
-
established
Ham
and
Beef
Shop
had
become
the
Railway
Eating
House
,
with
a
roast
leg
of
pork
daily
,
through
interested
motives
of
a
similar
immediate
and
popular
description
.
<EOS>
Lodging
-
house
keepers
were
favourable
in
like
manner
;
and
for
the
like
reasons
were
not
to
be
trusted
.
<EOS>
The
general
belief
was
very
slow
.
<EOS>
There
were
frowzy
fields
,
and
cow
-
houses
,
and
dunghills
,
and
dustheaps
,
and
ditches
,
and
gardens
,
and
summer
-
houses
,
and
carpet
-
beating
grounds
,
at
the
very
door
of
the
Railway
.
<EOS>
Little
tumuli
of
oyster
shells
in
the
oyster
season
,
and
of
lobster
shells
in
the
lobster
season
,
and
of
broken
crockery
and
faded
cabbage
leaves
in
all
seasons
,
encroached
upon
its
high
places
.
<EOS>
Posts
,
and
rails
,
and
old
cautions
to
trespassers
,
and
backs
of
mean
houses
,
and
patches
of
wretched
vegetation
,
stared
it
out
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
the
better
for
it
,
or
thought
of
being
so
.
<EOS>
If
the
miserable
waste
ground
lying
near
it
could
have
laughed
,
it
would
have
laughed
it
to
scorn
,
like
many
of
the
miserable
neighbours
.
  
<EOS>
Staggs
's
Gardens
was
uncommonly
incredulous
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
row
of
houses
,
with
little
squalid
patches
of
ground
before
them
,
fenced
off
with
old
doors
,
barrel
staves
,
scraps
of
tarpaulin
,
and
dead
bushes
;
with
bottomless
tin
kettles
and
exhausted
iron
fenders
,
thrust
into
the
gaps
.
<EOS>
Here
,
the
Staggs
's
Gardeners
trained
scarlet
beans
,
kept
fowls
and
rabbits
,
erected
rotten
summer
-
houses
(
one
was
an
old
boat
)
,
dried
clothes
,
and
smoked
pipes
.
<EOS>
Some
were
of
opinion
that
Staggs
's
Gardens
derived
its
name
from
a
deceased
capitalist
,
one
Mr
Staggs
,
who
had
built
it
for
his
delectation
.
<EOS>
Others
,
who
had
a
natural
taste
for
the
country
,
held
that
it
dated
from
those
rural
times
when
the
antlered
herd
,
under
the
familiar
denomination
of
Staggses
,
had
resorted
to
its
shady
precincts
.
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
Staggs
's
Gardens
was
regarded
by
its
population
as
a
sacred
grove
not
to
be
withered
by
railroads
;
and
so
confident
were
they
generally
of
its
long
outliving
any
such
ridiculous
inventions
,
that
the
master
chimney
-
sweeper
at
the
corner
,
who
was
understood
to
take
the
lead
in
the
local
politics
of
the
Gardens
,
had
publicly
declared
that
on
the
occasion
of
the
Railroad
opening
,
if
ever
it
did
open
,
two
of
his
boys
should
ascend
the
flues
of
his
dwelling
,
with
instructions
to
hail
the
failure
with
derisive
jeers
from
the
chimney
-
pots
.
  
<EOS>
To
this
unhallowed
spot
,
the
very
name
of
which
had
hitherto
been
carefully
concealed
from
Mr
Dombey
by
his
sister
,
was
little
Paul
now
borne
by
Fate
and
Richards
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
my
house
,
Susan
,
"
said
Polly
,
pointing
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
,
indeed
,
Mrs
Richards
?
"
said
Susan
,
condescendingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
there
's
my
sister
Jemima
at
the
door
,
I
do
declare
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Polly
,
"
with
my
own
sweet
precious
baby
in
her
arms
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
sight
added
such
an
extensive
pair
of
wings
to
Polly
's
impatience
,
that
she
set
off
down
the
Gardens
at
a
run
,
and
bouncing
on
Jemima
,
changed
babies
with
her
in
a
twinkling
;
to
the
utter
astonishment
of
that
young
damsel
,
on
whom
the
heir
of
the
Dombeys
seemed
to
have
fallen
from
the
clouds
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Polly
!
"
cried
Jemima
.
<EOS>
"
You
!
<EOS>
what
a
turn
you
have
given
me
!
<EOS>
who
'd
have
thought
it
!
<EOS>
come
along
in
Polly
!
<EOS>
How
well
you
do
look
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
The
children
will
go
half
wild
to
see
you
Polly
,
that
they
will
.
"
  
<EOS>
That
they
did
,
if
one
might
judge
from
the
noise
they
made
,
and
the
way
in
which
they
dashed
at
Polly
and
dragged
her
to
a
low
chair
in
the
chimney
corner
,
where
her
own
honest
apple
face
became
immediately
the
centre
of
a
bunch
of
smaller
pippins
,
all
laying
their
rosy
cheeks
close
to
it
,
and
all
evidently
the
growth
of
the
same
tree
.
<EOS>
As
to
Polly
,
she
was
full
as
noisy
and
vehement
as
the
children
;
and
it
was
not
until
she
was
quite
out
of
breath
,
and
her
hair
was
hanging
all
about
her
flushed
face
,
and
her
new
christening
attire
was
very
much
dishevelled
,
that
any
pause
took
place
in
the
confusion
.
<EOS>
Even
then
,
the
smallest
Toodle
but
one
remained
in
her
lap
,
holding
on
tight
with
both
arms
<EOS>
round
her
neck
;
while
the
smallest
Toodle
but
two
mounted
on
the
back
of
the
chair
,
and
made
desperate
efforts
,
with
one
leg
in
the
air
,
to
kiss
her
round
the
corner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
!
<EOS>
there
's
a
pretty
little
lady
come
to
see
you
,
"
said
Polly
;
"
and
see
how
quiet
she
is
!
<EOS>
what
a
beautiful
little
lady
,
ai
n't
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
This
reference
to
Florence
,
who
had
been
standing
by
the
door
not
unobservant
of
what
passed
,
directed
the
attention
of
the
younger
branches
towards
her
;
and
had
likewise
the
happy
effect
of
leading
to
the
formal
recognition
of
Miss
Nipper
,
who
was
not
quite
free
from
a
misgiving
that
she
had
been
already
slighted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
do
come
in
and
sit
down
a
minute
,
Susan
,
please
,
"
said
Polly
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
my
sister
Jemima
,
this
is
.
<EOS>
Jemima
,
I
do
n't
know
what
I
should
ever
do
with
myself
,
if
it
was
n't
for
Susan
Nipper
;
I
should
n't
be
here
now
but
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
do
sit
down
,
Miss
Nipper
,
if
you
please
,
"
quoth
Jemima
.
   
<EOS>
Susan
took
the
extreme
corner
of
a
chair
,
with
a
stately
and
ceremonious
aspect
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
was
so
glad
to
see
anybody
in
all
my
life
;
now
really
I
never
was
,
Miss
Nipper
,
"
said
Jemima
.
  
<EOS>
Susan
relaxing
,
took
a
little
more
of
the
chair
,
and
smiled
graciously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
untie
your
bonnet
-
strings
,
and
make
yourself
at
home
,
Miss
Nipper
,
please
,
"
entreated
Jemima
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
it
's
a
poorer
place
than
you
're
used
to
;
but
yoy'll
make
allowances
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
black
-
eyed
was
so
softened
by
this
deferential
behaviour
,
that
she
caught
up
little
Miss
Toodle
who
was
running
past
,
and
took
her
to
Banbury
Cross
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
where
's
my
pretty
boy
?
"
said
Polly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
poor
fellow
?
<EOS>
I
came
all
this
way
to
see
him
in
his
new
clothes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
what
a
pity
!
"
cried
Jemima
.
<EOS>
"
He
'll
break
his
heart
,
when
he
hears
his
mother
has
been
here
.
<EOS>
He
's
at
school
,
Polly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gone
already
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
He
went
for
the
first
time
yesterday
,
for
fear
he
should
lose
any
learning
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
half
-
holding
,
Polly
:
if
you
could
only
stop
till
he
comes
home
---
you
and
Miss
Nipper
,
least
-
ways
,
"
said
Jemima
,
mindful
in
good
time
of
the
dignity
of
the
black
-
eyed
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
does
he
look
,
Jemima
,
bless
him
!
"
<EOS>
faltered
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
really
he
do
n't
look
so
bad
as
you
'd
suppose
,
"
returned
Jemima
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Polly
,
with
emotion
,
"
I
knew
his
legs
must
be
too
short
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
legs
is
short
,
"
returned
Jemima
;
"
especially
behind
;
but
they
'll
get
longer
,
Polly
,
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
slow
,
prospective
kind
of
consolation
;
but
the
cheerfulness
and
good
nature
with
which
it
was
administered
,
gave
it
a
value
it
did
not
intrinsically
possess
.
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
silence
,
Polly
asked
,
in
a
more
sprightly
manner
:
  
"
<EOS>
And
where
's
Father
,
<EOS>
Jemima
dear
?
"
<EOS>
---
for
by
that
patriarchal
appellation
,
Mr
Toodle
was
generally
known
in
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
again
!
"
said
Jemima
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
pity
!
<EOS>
Father
took
his
dinner
with
him
this
morning
,
and
is
n't
coming
home
till
night
.
<EOS>
But
he
's
always
talking
of
you
,
Polly
,
and
telling
the
children
about
you
;
and
is
the
peaceablest
,
patientest
,
best
-
temperedest
soul
in
the
world
,
as
he
always
was
and
will
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
Jemima
,
"
cried
the
simple
Polly
;
delighted
by
the
speech
,
and
disappointed
by
the
absence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
you
need
n't
thank
me
,
Polly
,
"
said
her
sister
,
giving
her
a
sound
kiss
upon
the
cheek
,
and
then
dancing
little
Paul
cheerfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
the
same
of
you
sometimes
,
and
think
it
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
spite
of
the
double
disappointment
,
it
was
impossible
to
regard
in
the
light
of
a
failure
a
visit
which
was
greeted
with
such
a
reception
;
so
the
sisters
talked
hopefully
about
family
matters
,
and
about
Biler
,
and
about
all
his
brothers
and
sisters
:
while
the
black
-
eyed
,
having
performed
several
journeys
to
Banbury
Cross
and
back
,
took
sharp
note
of
the
furniture
,
the
Dutch
clock
,
the
cupboard
,
the
castle
on
the
mantel
-
piece
with
red
and
green
windows
in
it
,
susceptible
of
illumination
by
a
candle
-
end
within
;
and
the
pair
of
small
black
velvet
kittens
,
each
with
a
lady
's
reticule
in
its
mouth
;
regarded
by
the
Staggs
's
Gardeners
as
prodigies
of
imitative
art
.
<EOS>
The
conversation
soon
becoming
general
lest
the
black
-
eyed
should
go
off
at
score
and
turn
sarcastic
,
that
young
lady
related
to
Jemima
a
summary
of
everything
she
knew
concerning
Mr
Dombey
,
his
prospects
,
family
,
pursuits
,
and
character
.
<EOS>
Also
an
exact
inventory
of
her
personal
wardrobe
,
and
some
account
of
her
principal
relations
and
friends
.
<EOS>
Having
relieved
her
mind
of
these
disclosures
,
she
partook
of
shrimps
and
porter
,
and
evinced
a
disposition
to
swear
eternal
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
Little
Florence
herself
was
not
behind
-
hand
in
improving
the
occasion
:
for
,
being
conducted
forth
by
young
Toodles
to
inspect
some
toad
-
stools
and
other
curiosities
of
the
Gardens
<EOS>
,
she
entered
with
them
,
heart
and
soul
,
on
the
formation
of
a
temporary
breakwater
across
a
small
green
pool
that
had
collected
in
a
corner
.
<EOS>
She
was
still
busily
engaged
in
that
labour
,
when
sought
and
found
by
Susan
;
who
,
such
was
her
sense
of
duty
,
even
under
the
humanizing
influence
of
shrimps
,
delivered
a
moral
address
to
her
(
punctuated
with
thumps
)
on
her
degenerate
nature
,
while
washing
her
face
and
hands
;
and
predicted
that
she
would
bring
the
grey
hairs
of
her
family
in
general
,
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
After
some
delay
,
occasioned
by
a
pretty
long
confidential
interview
above
stairs
on
pecuniary
subjects
,
between
Polly
and
Jemima
,
an
interchange
of
babies
was
again
effected
---
for
Polly
had
all
this
time
retained
her
own
child
,
and
Jemima
little
Paul
---
and
the
visitors
took
leave
.
  
<EOS>
But
first
the
young
Toodles
,
victims
of
a
pious
fraud
,
were
deluded
into
repairing
in
a
body
to
a
chandler
's
shop
in
the
neighbourhood
,
for
the
ostensible
purpose
of
spending
a
penny
;
and
when
the
coast
was
quite
clear
,
Polly
fled
;
Jemima
calling
after
her
that
if
they
could
only
go
round
towards
the
City
Road
on
their
way
back
,
they
would
be
sure
to
meet
little
Biler
coming
from
school
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
that
we
might
make
time
to
go
a
little
round
in
that
direction
,
Susan
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
,
Polly
,
when
they
halted
to
take
breath
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
,
Mrs
Richards
?
"
returned
Susan
.
  
<EOS>
It
's
getting
on
towards
our
dinner
time
you
know
,
said
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
But
lunch
had
rendered
her
companion
more
than
indifferent
to
this
grave
consideration
,
so
she
allowed
no
weight
to
it
,
and
they
resolved
to
go
"
a
little
round
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
it
happened
that
poor
Biler
's
life
had
been
,
since
yesterday
morning
,
rendered
weary
by
the
costume
of
the
Charitable
Grinders
.
<EOS>
The
youth
of
the
streets
could
not
endure
it
.
<EOS>
No
young
vagabond
could
be
brought
to
bear
its
contemplation
for
a
moment
,
without
throwing
himself
upon
the
unoffending
wearer
,
and
doing
him
a
mischief
.
<EOS>
His
social
existence
had
been
more
like
that
of
an
early
Christian
,
than
an
innocent
child
of
the
nineteenth
century
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
stoned
in
the
streets
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
overthrown
into
gutters
;
bespattered
with
mud
;
violently
flattened
against
posts
.
<EOS>
Entire
strangers
to
his
person
had
lifted
his
yellow
cap
off
his
head
and
cast
it
to
the
winds
.
<EOS>
His
legs
had
not
only
undergone
verbal
criticisms
and
revilings
,
but
had
been
handled
and
pinched
.
<EOS>
That
very
morning
,
he
had
received
a
perfectly
unsolicited
black
eye
on
his
way
to
the
Grinders
'
establishment
,
and
had
been
punished
for
it
by
the
master
:
a
superannuated
old
Grinder
of
savage
disposition
,
who
had
been
appointed
schoolmaster
because
he
did
n't
know
anything
,
and
was
n't
fit
for
anything
,
and
for
whose
cruel
cane
all
chubby
little
boys
had
a
perfect
fascination
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
it
fell
out
that
Biler
,
on
his
way
home
,
sought
unfrequented
paths
;
and
slunk
along
by
narrow
passages
and
back
streets
,
to
avoid
his
tormentors
.
<EOS>
Being
compelled
to
emerge
into
the
main
road
,
his
ill
fortune
brought
him
at
last
where
a
small
party
of
boys
,
headed
by
a
ferocious
young
butcher
,
were
lying
in
wait
for
any
means
of
pleasurable
excitement
that
might
happen
.
<EOS>
These
,
finding
a
Charitable
Grinder
in
the
midst
of
them
---
unaccountably
delivered
over
,
as
it
were
,
into
their
hands
---
set
up
a
general
yell
and
rushed
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
so
fell
out
likewise
,
that
,
at
the
same
time
,
Polly
,
looking
hopelessly
along
the
road
before
her
,
after
a
good
hour
's
walk
,
had
said
it
was
no
use
going
any
further
,
when
suddenly
she
saw
this
sight
.
<EOS>
She
no
sooner
saw
it
than
,
uttering
a
hasty
exclamation
,
and
giving
Master
Dombey
to
the
black
-
eyed
,
she
started
to
the
rescue
of
her
unhappy
little
son
.
  
<EOS>
Surprises
,
like
misfortunes
,
rarely
come
alone
.
<EOS>
The
astonished
Susan
Nipper
and
her
two
young
charges
were
rescued
by
the
bystanders
from
under
the
very
wheels
of
a
passing
carriage
before
they
knew
what
had
happened
;
and
at
that
moment
(
it
was
market
day
)
<EOS>
a
thundering
alarm
of
"
Mad
Bull
"
was
raised
.
  
<EOS>
With
a
wild
confusion
before
her
,
of
people
running
up
and
down
,
and
shouting
,
and
wheels
running
over
them
,
and
boys
fighting
,
and
mad
bulls
coming
up
,
and
the
nurse
in
the
midst
of
all
these
dangers
being
torn
to
pieces
,
Florence
screamed
and
ran
.
<EOS>
She
ran
till
she
was
exhausted
,
urging
Susan
to
do
the
same
;
and
then
,
stopping
and
wringing
her
hands
as
she
remembered
they
had
left
the
other
nurse
behind
,
found
,
with
a
sensation
of
terror
not
to
be
described
,
that
she
was
quite
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Susan
!
Susan
!
"
cried
Florence
,
clapping
her
hands
in
the
very
ecstasy
of
her
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
where
are
they
?
<EOS>
where
are
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
are
they
?
"
said
an
old
woman
,
coming
hobbling
across
as
fast
as
she
could
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
run
away
from
'
em
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
frightened
,
"
answered
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
what
I
did
.
<EOS>
I
thought
they
were
with
me
.
<EOS>
Where
are
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
took
her
by
the
wrist
,
and
said
,
"
I
'll
show
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
a
very
ugly
old
woman
,
with
red
rims
round
her
eyes
,
and
a
mouth
that
mumbled
and
chattered
of
itself
when
she
was
not
speaking
.
<EOS>
She
was
miserably
dressed
,
and
carried
some
skins
over
her
arm
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
have
followed
Florence
some
little
way
at
all
events
,
for
she
had
lost
her
breath
;
and
this
made
her
uglier
still
,
as
she
stood
trying
to
regain
it
:
working
her
shrivelled
yellow
face
and
throat
into
all
sorts
of
contortions
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
was
afraid
of
her
,
and
looked
,
hesitating
,
up
the
street
,
of
which
she
had
almost
reached
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
solitary
place
---
more
a
back
road
than
a
street
---
and
there
was
no
one
in
it
but
herself
and
the
old
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
be
frightened
now
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
still
holding
her
tight
.
<EOS>
"
Come
along
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
do
n't
know
you
.
<EOS>
What
's
your
name
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Brown
,
"
said
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
Mrs
Brown
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Are
they
near
here
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Florence
,
beginning
to
be
led
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Susan
an't
far
off
,
"
said
Good
Mrs
Brown
;
"
and
the
others
are
close
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
anybody
hurt
?
"
cried
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
"
said
Good
Mrs
Brown
.
  
<EOS>
The
child
shed
tears
of
delight
on
hearing
this
,
and
accompanied
the
old
woman
willingly
;
though
she
could
not
help
glancing
at
her
face
as
they
went
along
---
particularly
at
that
industrious
mouth
---
and
wondering
whether
Bad
Mrs
Brown
,
if
there
were
such
a
person
,
was
at
all
like
her
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
not
gone
far
,
but
had
gone
by
some
very
uncomfortable
places
,
such
as
brick
-
fields
and
tile
-
yards
,
when
the
old
woman
turned
down
a
dirty
lane
,
where
the
mud
lay
in
deep
black
ruts
in
the
middle
of
the
road
.
<EOS>
She
stopped
before
a
shabby
little
house
,
as
closely
shut
up
as
a
house
that
was
full
of
cracks
and
crevices
could
be
.
<EOS>
Opening
the
door
with
a
key
she
took
out
of
her
bonnet
,
she
pushed
the
child
before
her
into
a
back
room
,
where
there
was
a
great
heap
of
rags
of
different
colours
lying
on
the
floor
;
a
heap
of
bones
,
and
a
heap
of
sifted
dust
or
cinders
;
but
there
was
no
furniture
at
all
,
and
the
walls
and
ceiling
were
quite
black
.
  
<EOS>
The
child
became
so
terrified
that
she
was
stricken
speechless
,
and
looked
as
though
about
to
swoon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
do
n't
be
a
young
mule
,
"
said
Good
Mrs
Brown
,
reviving
her
with
a
shake
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
a
going
to
hurt
you
.
<EOS>
Sit
upon
the
rags
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
obeyed
her
,
holding
out
her
folded
hands
,
in
mute
supplication
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
a
going
to
keep
you
,
even
,
above
an
hour
,
"
said
Mrs
Brown
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
D'ye
understand
what
I
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
child
answered
with
great
difficulty
,
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
Good
Mrs
Brown
,
taking
her
own
seat
on
the
bones
,
"
do
n't
vex
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
,
I
tell
you
I
wo
n't
hurt
you
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
do
,
I
'll
kill
you
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
you
killed
at
any
time
---
even
if
you
was
in
your
own
bed
at
home
.
<EOS>
Now
let
's
know
who
you
are
,
and
what
you
are
,
and
all
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
's
threats
and
promises
;
the
dread
of
giving
her
offence
;
and
the
habit
,
unusual
to
a
child
,
but
almost
natural
to
Florence
now
,
of
being
quiet
,
and
repressing
what
she
felt
,
and
feared
,
and
hoped
;
enabled
her
to
do
this
bidding
,
and
to
tell
her
little
history
,
or
what
she
knew
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Brown
listened
attentively
,
until
she
had
finished
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
your
name
's
Dombey
,
eh
?
"
said
Mrs
Brown
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
that
pretty
frock
,
Miss
Dombey
,
"
said
Good
Mrs
Brown
,
"
and
that
little
bonnet
,
and
a
petticoat
or
two
,
and
anything
else
you
can
spare
.
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
Take
'em
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
obeyed
,
as
fast
as
her
trembling
hands
would
allow
;
keeping
,
all
the
while
,
a
frightened
eye
on
Mrs
Brown
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
divested
herself
of
all
the
articles
of
apparel
mentioned
by
that
lady
,
Mrs
B
examined
them
at
leisure
,
and
seemed
tolerably
well
satisfied
with
their
quality
and
value
.
  
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
running
her
eyes
over
the
child
's
slight
figure
,
"
I
do
n't
see
anything
else
---
except
the
shoes
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
the
shoes
,
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
little
Florence
took
them
off
with
equal
alacrity
,
only
too
glad
to
have
any
more
means
of
conciliation
about
her
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
then
produced
some
wretched
substitutes
from
the
bottom
of
the
heap
of
rags
,
which
she
turned
up
for
that
purpose
;
together
with
a
girl
's
cloak
,
quite
worn
out
and
very
old
;
and
the
crushed
remains
of
a
bonnet
that
had
probably
been
picked
up
from
some
ditch
or
dunghill
.
<EOS>
In
this
dainty
raiment
,
she
instructed
Florence
to
dress
herself
;
and
as
such
preparation
seemed
a
prelude
to
her
release
,
the
child
complied
with
increased
readiness
,
if
possible
.
  
<EOS>
In
hurriedly
putting
on
the
bonnet
,
if
that
may
be
called
a
bonnet
which
was
more
like
a
pad
to
carry
loads
on
,
she
caught
it
in
her
hair
which
grew
luxuriantly
,
and
could
not
immediately
disentangle
it
.
<EOS>
Good
Mrs
Brown
whipped
out
a
large
pair
or
scissors
,
and
fell
into
an
unaccountable
state
of
excitement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
could
n't
you
let
me
be
,
"
said
Mrs
Brown
,
"
when
I
was
contented
?
<EOS>
You
little
fool
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
I
have
done
,
"
panted
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
help
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Could
n't
help
it
!
"
cried
Mrs
Brown
.
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
expect
I
can
help
it
?
<EOS>
Why
,
Lord
!
"
said
the
old
woman
,
ruffling
her
curls
with
a
furious
pleasure
,
"
anybody
but
me
would
have
had
'em
off
first
of
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
was
so
relieved
to
find
that
it
was
only
her
hair
and
not
her
head
which
Mrs
Brown
coveted
,
that
she
offered
no
resistance
or
entreaty
,
and
merely
raised
her
mild
eyes
towards
the
face
of
that
good
soul
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
n't
once
had
a
gal
of
my
own
---
beyond
seas
now
---
that
was
proud
of
her
hair
,
"
said
Mrs
Brown
,
"
I
'd
have
had
every
lock
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
's
far
away
,
she
's
far
away
!
<EOS>
Oho
!
Oho
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Brown
's
was
not
a
melodious
cry
,
but
,
accompanied
with
a
wild
tossing
up
of
her
lean
arms
<EOS>
,
it
was
full
of
passionate
grief
,
and
thrilled
to
the
heart
of
Florence
,
whom
it
frightened
more
than
ever
.
<EOS>
It
had
its
part
,
perhaps
,
in
saving
her
curls
;
for
Mrs
Brown
,
after
hovering
about
her
with
the
scissors
for
some
moments
,
like
a
new
kind
of
butterfly
,
bade
her
<EOS>
hide
them
under
the
bonnet
and
let
no
trace
of
them
escape
to
tempt
her
.
<EOS>
Having
accomplished
this
victory
over
herself
,
Mrs
Brown
resumed
her
seat
on
the
bones
,
and
smoked
a
very
short
black
pipe
,
mowing
and
mumbling
all
the
time
,
as
if
she
were
eating
the
stem
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
pipe
was
smoked
out
,
she
gave
the
child
a
rabbitskin
to
carry
,
that
she
might
appear
the
more
like
her
ordinary
companion
,
and
told
her
that
she
was
now
going
to
lead
her
to
a
public
street
whence
she
could
inquire
her
way
to
her
friends
.
<EOS>
But
she
cautioned
her
,
with
threats
of
summary
and
deadly
vengeance
in
case
of
disobedience
,
not
to
talk
to
strangers
,
nor
to
repair
to
her
own
home
(
which
may
have
been
too
near
for
Mrs
Brown
's
convenience
)
,
but
to
her
father
's
office
in
the
City
;
also
to
wait
at
the
street
corner
where
she
would
be
left
,
until
the
clock
struck
three
.
<EOS>
These
directions
Mrs
brown
enforced
with
assurances
that
there
would
be
potent
eyes
and
ears
in
her
employment
cognizant
of
all
she
did
;
and
these
directions
Florence
promised
faithfully
and
earnestly
to
observe
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
,
Mrs
Brown
,
issuing
forth
,
conducted
her
changed
and
ragged
little
friend
through
a
labyrinth
of
narrow
streets
and
lanes
and
alleys
,
which
emerged
,
after
a
long
time
,
upon
a
stable
yard
,
with
a
gateway
at
the
end
,
whence
the
roar
of
a
great
thoroughfare
made
itself
audible
.
<EOS>
Pointing
out
this
gateway
,
and
informing
Florence
that
when
the
clocks
struck
three
she
was
to
go
to
the
left
,
Mrs
Brown
,
after
making
a
parting
grasp
at
her
hair
which
seemed
involuntary
and
quite
beyond
her
own
control
,
told
her
she
knew
what
to
do
,
and
bade
her
go
and
do
it
:
remembering
that
she
was
watched
.
  
<EOS>
With
a
lighter
heart
,
but
still
sore
afraid
,
Florence
felt
herself
released
,
and
tripped
off
to
the
corner
.
<EOS>
When
she
reached
it
,
she
looked
back
and
saw
the
head
of
Good
Mrs
Brown
peeping
out
of
the
low
wooden
passage
,
where
she
had
issued
her
parting
injunctions
;
likewise
the
first
of
Good
Mrs
Brown
shaking
towards
her
.
<EOS>
But
though
she
often
looked
back
afterwards
---
every
minute
,
at
least
,
in
her
nervous
recollection
of
the
old
woman
---
she
could
not
see
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
remained
there
,
looked
at
the
bustle
in
the
street
,
and
more
and
more
bewildered
by
it
;
and
in
the
meanwhile
the
clocks
appeared
to
have
made
up
their
minds
never
to
strike
three
any
more
.
<EOS>
At
last
the
steeples
rang
out
three
o'clock
;
there
was
one
close
by
,
so
she
could
n't
be
mistaken
;
and
<EOS>
---
after
often
looking
over
her
shoulder
,
and
often
going
a
little
way
,
and
as
often
coming
back
again
,
lest
the
all
-
powerful
spies
of
Mrs
Brown
should
take
offence
---
she
hurried
off
,
as
fast
as
she
could
in
her
slipshod
shoes
,
holding
the
rabbit
-
skin
tight
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
All
she
knew
of
her
father
's
offices
was
that
they
belonged
to
Dombey
and
Son
,
and
that
that
was
a
great
power
belonging
to
the
City
.
<EOS>
So
she
could
only
ask
the
way
to
Dombey
and
Son
's
in
the
City
;
and
as
she
generally
made
inquiry
of
children
---
being
afraid
to
ask
grown
people
---
she
got
very
little
satisfaction
indeed
.
<EOS>
But
by
dint
of
asking
her
way
to
the
City
after
a
while
,
and
dropping
the
rest
of
her
inquiry
for
the
present
,
she
really
did
advance
,
by
slow
degrees
,
towards
the
heart
of
that
great
region
which
is
governed
by
the
terrible
Lord
Mayor
.
  
<EOS>
Tired
of
walking
,
repulsed
and
pushed
about
,
stunned
by
the
noise
and
confusion
,
anxious
for
her
brother
and
the
nurses
,
terrified
by
what
she
had
undergone
,
and
<EOS>
the
prospect
of
encountering
her
angry
father
in
such
an
altered
state
;
perplexed
and
frightened
alike
by
what
had
passed
,
and
what
was
passing
,
and
what
was
yet
before
her
;
Florence
went
upon
her
weary
way
with
tearful
eyes
,
and
once
or
twice
could
not
help
stopping
to
ease
her
bursting
heart
by
crying
bitterly
.
<EOS>
But
few
people
noticed
her
at
those
times
,
in
the
garb
she
wore
:
or
if
they
did
,
believed
that
she
was
tutored
to
excite
compassion
,
and
passed
on
.
<EOS>
Florence
,
too
,
called
to
her
aid
all
the
firmness
and
self
-
reliance
of
a
character
that
her
sad
experience
had
prematurely
formed
and
tried
:
and
keeping
the
end
she
had
in
view
steadily
before
her
,
steadily
pursued
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
full
two
hours
later
in
the
afternoon
than
when
she
had
started
on
this
strange
adventure
,
when
escaping
from
the
clash
and
clangour
of
a
narrow
street
full
of
carts
and
waggons
,
she
peeped
into
a
kind
of
wharf
or
landing
-
place
upon
the
river
-
side
,
where
there
were
a
great
many
packages
,
casks
,
and
boxes
,
strewn
about
;
a
large
pair
of
wooden
scales
;
and
a
little
wooden
house
on
wheels
,
outside
of
which
,
looking
at
the
neighbouring
masts
and
boats
,
a
stout
man
stood
whistling
,
with
his
pen
behind
his
ear
,
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
as
if
his
day
's
work
were
nearly
done
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
then
!
"
said
this
man
,
happening
to
turn
round
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
n't
got
anything
for
you
,
little
girl
.
<EOS>
Be
off
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
is
this
the
City
?
"
asked
the
trembling
daughter
of
the
Dombeys
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
It
's
the
City
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
well
enough
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
Be
off
!
<EOS>
We
have
n't
got
anything
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
anything
,
thank
you
,
"
<EOS>
was
the
timid
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Except
to
know
the
way
to
Dombey
and
Son
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
who
had
been
strolling
carelessly
towards
her
,
seemed
surprised
by
this
reply
,
and
looking
attentively
in
her
face
,
rejoined
:
  
"
Why
,
what
can
you
want
with
Dombey
and
Son
's
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
know
the
way
there
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
looked
at
her
yet
more
curiously
,
and
rubbed
the
back
of
his
head
so
hard
in
his
wonderment
that
he
knocked
his
own
hat
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
Joe
!
"
he
called
to
another
man
---
a
labourer
---
as
he
picked
it
up
and
put
it
on
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Joe
it
is
!
"
said
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
's
that
young
spark
of
Dombey
's
who
's
been
watching
the
shipment
of
them
goods
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
gone
,
by
t'other
gate
,
"
said
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Call
him
back
a
minute
.
"
  
<EOS>
Joe
ran
up
an
archway
,
bawling
as
he
went
,
and
very
soon
returned
with
a
blithe
-
looking
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
Dombey
's
jockey
,
an't
you
?
"
said
the
first
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
in
Dombey
's
House
,
Mr
Clark
,
"
returned
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look'ye
here
,
then
,
"
said
Mr
Clark
.
  
<EOS>
Obedient
to
the
indication
of
Mr
Clark
's
hand
,
the
boy
approached
towards
Florence
,
wondering
,
as
well
he
might
,
what
he
had
to
do
with
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
,
who
had
heard
what
passed
,
and
who
,
besides
the
relief
of
so
suddenly
considering
herself
safe
at
her
journey
's
end
,
felt
reassured
beyond
all
measure
by
his
lively
youthful
face
and
manner
,
ran
eagerly
up
to
him
,
leaving
one
of
the
slipshod
shoes
upon
the
ground
and
caught
his
hand
in
both
of
hers
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
lost
,
if
you
please
!
"
said
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lost
!
"
cried
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
was
lost
this
morning
,
a
long
way
from
here
---
and
I
have
had
my
clothes
taken
away
,
since
---
<EOS>
and
I
am
not
dressed
in
my
own
now
---
and
<EOS>
my
name
is
Florence
Dombey
,
my
little
brother
's
only
sister
---
<EOS>
and
,
oh
dear
,
dear
,
take
care
of
me
,
if
you
please
!
"
<EOS>
sobbed
Florence
,
giving
full
vent
to
the
childish
feelings
she
had
so
long
suppressed
,
and
bursting
into
tears
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
her
miserable
bonnet
falling
off
,
her
hair
came
tumbling
down
about
her
face
:
moving
to
speechless
admiration
and
commiseration
,
young
Walter
,
nephew
of
Solomon
Gills
,
Ships
'
Instrument
-
maker
in
general
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Clark
stood
rapt
in
amazement
:
observing
under
his
breath
<EOS>
,
I
never
saw
such
a
start
on
this
wharf
before
.
<EOS>
Walter
picked
up
the
shoe
,
and
put
it
on
the
little
foot
as
the
Prince
in
the
story
might
have
fitted
Cinderella
's
slipper
on
.
<EOS>
He
hung
the
rabbit
-
skin
over
his
left
arm
;
gave
the
right
to
Florence
:
and
felt
,
not
to
say
like
Richard
Whittington
---
that
is
a
tame
comparison
---
<EOS>
but
like
Saint
George
of
England
,
with
the
dragon
lying
dead
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
cry
,
Miss
Dombey
,
"
said
Walter
,
in
a
transport
of
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
wonderful
thing
for
me
that
I
am
here
!
<EOS>
You
are
as
safe
now
as
if
you
were
guarded
by
a
whole
boat
's
crew
of
picked
men
from
a
man
-
of
-
war
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
do
n't
cry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
cry
any
more
,
"
said
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
only
crying
for
joy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Crying
for
joy
!
"
<EOS>
thought
Walter
,
"
and
I
'm
the
cause
of
it!Come
along
,
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
There
's
the
other
shoe
off
now!Take
<EOS>
mine
,
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
said
Florence
,
checking
him
in
the
act
of
impetuously
pulling
off
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
These
do
better
.
<EOS>
These
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
Walter
,
glancing
at
her
foot
,
"
mine
are
a
mile
too
large
.
<EOS>
What
am
I
thinking
about
!
<EOS>
You
never
could
walk
in
mine
!
<EOS>
Come
along
,
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
the
villain
who
will
dare
molest
you
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
Walter
,
looking
immensely
fierce
,
led
off
Florence
,
looking
very
happy
;
and
they
went
arm
-
in
-
arm
along
the
streets
,
perfectly
indifferent
to
any
astonishment
that
their
appearance
might
or
did
excite
by
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
growing
dark
and
foggy
,
and
beginning
to
rain
too
;
but
they
cared
nothing
for
this
:
being
both
wholly
absorbed
in
the
late
adventures
of
Florence
,
which
she
related
with
the
innocent
good
faith
and
confidence
of
her
years
,
while
Walter
listened
as
if
,
far
from
the
mud
and
grease
of
Thames
Street
,
they
were
rambling
alone
among
the
broad
leaves
and
tall
trees
of
some
desert
island
in
the
tropics
---
as
he
very
likely
fancied
,
for
the
time
,
they
were
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
we
far
to
go
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Florence
at
last
,
lifting
up
her
eyes
to
her
companion
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
bye
<EOS>
,
"
said
Walter
,
stopping
,
"
let
me
see
;
where
are
we
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
know
.
<EOS>
But
the
offices
are
shut
up
now
,
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
There
's
nobody
there
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
has
gone
home
long
ago
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
must
go
home
too
?
<EOS>
or
,
stay
.
<EOS>
Suppose
I
take
you
to
my
uncle
's
,
where
I
live
<EOS>
---
it
's
very
near
here
---
and
go
to
your
house
in
a
coach
to
tell
them
you
are
safe
,
and
bring
you
back
some
clothes
.
<EOS>
Wo
n't
that
be
best
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
,
"
answered
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
?
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
?
"
  
<EOS>
As
they
stood
deliberating
in
the
street
,
a
man
passed
them
,
who
glanced
quickly
at
Walter
as
he
went
by
,
as
if
he
recognised
him
;
but
seeming
to
correct
that
first
impression
,
he
passed
on
without
stopping
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
think
it
's
Mr
Carker
,
"
said
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Carker
in
our
House
.
<EOS>
Not
Carker
our
manager
,
Miss
Dombey
---
the
other
Carker
;
the
junior
---
Halloa
!
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
Walter
Gay
?
"
said
the
other
,
stopping
and
returning
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
believe
it
,
with
such
a
strange
companion
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
stood
near
a
lamp
,
listening
with
surprise
to
Walter
's
hurried
explanation
,
he
presented
a
remarkable
contrast
to
the
two
youthful
figures
arm
-
in
-
arm
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
old
,
but
his
hair
was
white
;
his
body
was
bent
,
or
bowed
as
if
by
the
weight
of
some
great
trouble
:
and
there
were
deep
lines
in
his
worn
and
melancholy
face
.
<EOS>
The
fire
of
his
eyes
,
the
expression
of
his
features
,
the
very
voice
in
which
he
spoke
,
were
all
subdued
and
quenched
,
as
if
the
spirit
within
him
lay
in
ashes
.
<EOS>
He
was
respectably
,
though
very
plainly
dressed
,
in
black
;
but
his
clothes
,
moulded
to
the
general
character
of
his
figure
,
seemed
to
shrink
and
abase
themselves
upon
him
,
and
to
join
in
the
sorrowful
solicitation
which
the
whole
man
from
head
to
foot
expressed
,
to
be
left
unnoticed
,
and
alone
in
his
humility
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
his
interest
in
youth
and
hopefulness
was
not
extinguished
with
the
other
embers
of
his
soul
<EOS>
,
for
he
watched
the
boy
's
earnest
countenance
as
he
spoke
with
unusual
sympathy
,
though
with
an
inexplicable
show
of
trouble
and
compassion
,
which
escaped
into
his
looks
,
however
hard
he
strove
to
hold
it
prisoner
.
<EOS>
When
Walter
,
in
conclusion
,
put
to
him
the
question
he
had
put
to
Florence
,
he
still
stood
glancing
at
him
with
the
same
expression
,
as
if
he
had
read
some
fate
upon
his
face
,
mournfully
at
variance
with
its
present
brightness
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
advise
,
Mr
Carker
?
"
said
Walter
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
You
always
give
me
good
advice
,
you
know
,
when
you
do
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
That
's
not
often
,
though
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
your
own
idea
is
the
best
,
"
he
answered
:
looking
from
Florence
to
Walter
,
and
back
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Carker
,
"
said
Walter
,
brightening
with
a
generous
thought
,
"
Come
!
<EOS>
Here
's
chance
for
you
.
<EOS>
Go
you
to
Mr
Dombey
's
and
be
the
messenger
of
good
news
.
<EOS>
It
may
do
you
some
good
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
I
'll
remain
at
home
.
<EOS>
You
shall
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
!
"
returned
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Why
not
,
Mr
Carker
?
"
said
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
He
merely
shook
him
by
the
hand
in
answer
;
he
seemed
in
a
manner
ashamed
and
afraid
even
to
do
that
;
and
bidding
him
good
night
,
and
advising
him
to
make
haste
,
turned
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Miss
Dombey
,
"
said
Walter
,
looking
after
him
as
they
turned
away
also
,
"
we
'll
go
to
my
uncle
's
as
quick
as
we
can
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
hear
Mr
Dombey
speak
of
Mr
Carker
the
junior
,
Miss
Florence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returned
the
child
,
mildly
,
"
<EOS>
I
do
n't
often
hear
papa
speak
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
true
!
<EOS>
more
shame
for
him
,
"
thought
Walter
.
<EOS>
After
a
minute
's
pause
,
during
which
he
had
been
looking
down
upon
the
gentle
patient
little
face
moving
on
at
his
side
,
he
bestirred
himself
with
his
accustomed
boyish
animation
and
restlessness
to
change
the
subject
;
and
one
of
the
unfortunate
shoes
coming
off
again
opportunely
,
proposed
to
carry
Florence
to
his
uncle
's
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
Florence
,
though
very
tired
,
laughingly
declined
the
proposal
,
lest
he
should
let
her
fall
;
and
as
they
were
already
near
the
wooden
midshipman
,
and
as
Walter
went
on
to
cite
various
precedents
,
from
shipwrecks
and
other
moving
accidents
,
where
younger
boys
than
he
had
triumphantly
rescued
and
carried
off
older
girls
than
Florence
,
they
were
still
in
full
conversation
about
it
when
they
arrived
at
the
instrument
-
maker
's
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Holloa
,
Uncle
Sol
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Walter
,
bursting
into
the
shop
,
and
speaking
incoherently
and
out
of
breath
,
from
that
time
forth
,
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
wonderful
adventure
!
<EOS>
Here
's
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
daughter
lost
in
the
streets
,
and
robbed
of
her
clothes
by
an
old
witch
of
a
woman
---
found
by
me
---
brought
home
to
our
parlour
to
rest
---
look
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
Heaven
!
"
said
Uncle
Sol
,
starting
back
against
his
favourite
compass
-
case
.
<EOS>
"
It
ca
n't
be
!
<EOS>
Well
,
I
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
,
nor
anybody
else
,
"
said
Walter
,
anticipating
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
Nobody
would
,
nobody
could
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Here
!
<EOS>
just
help
me
lift
the
little
sofa
near
the
fire
,
will
you
,
Uncle
Sol
---
take
care
of
the
plates
---
cut
some
dinner
for
her
,
will
you
,
uncle
---
throw
those
shoes
under
the
grate
.
<EOS>
Miss
Florence
---
put
your
feet
on
the
fender
to
dry
---
<EOS>
how
damp
they
are
---
here
's
an
adventure
,
uncle
,
eh
?
---
<EOS>
God
bless
my
soul
,
how
hot
I
am
!
"
  
<EOS>
Solomon
Gills
was
quite
as
hot
,
by
sympathy
,
and
in
excessive
bewilderment
.
<EOS>
He
patted
Florence
's
head
,
pressed
her
to
eat
,
pressed
her
to
drink
,
rubbed
the
soles
of
her
feet
with
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
heated
at
the
fire
,
followed
his
locomotive
nephew
with
his
eyes
,
and
ears
,
and
had
no
clear
perception
of
anything
except
that
he
was
being
constantly
knocked
against
and
tumbled
over
by
that
excited
young
gentleman
,
as
he
darted
about
the
room
attempting
to
accomplish
twenty
things
at
once
,
and
doing
nothing
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
wait
a
minute
,
uncle
,
"
he
continued
,
catching
up
a
candle
,
"
till
I
run
up
stairs
,
and
get
another
jacket
on
,
and
then
I
'll
be
off
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
uncle
,
is
n't
this
an
adventure
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
boy
,
"
said
Solomon
,
who
,
with
his
spectacles
on
his
forehead
and
the
great
chronometer
in
his
pocket
,
was
incessantly
oscillating
between
Florence
on
the
sofa
and
his
nephew
in
all
parts
of
the
parlour
,
<EOS>
"
it
's
the
most
extraordinary
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
,
but
do
,
uncle
,
please
---
do
,
Miss
Florence
---
dinner
,
you
know
,
uncle
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
,
"
cried
Solomon
,
cutting
instantly
into
a
leg
of
mutton
,
as
if
he
were
catering
for
a
giant
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
care
of
her
,
Wally
!
<EOS>
I
understand
.
<EOS>
Pretty
dear
!
<EOS>
Famished
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
You
go
and
get
ready
.
<EOS>
Lord
bless
me
!
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Whittington

Mayor

"
  
<EOS>
Walter
was
not
very
long
in
mounting
to
his
lofty
garret
and
descending
from
it
,
but
in
the
meantime
Florence
,
overcome
by
fatigue
,
had
sunk
into
a
doze
before
the
fire
.
<EOS>
The
short
interval
of
quiet
,
though
only
a
few
minutes
in
duration
,
enabled
Solomon
gills
so
far
to
collect
his
wits
as
to
make
some
little
arrangements
for
her
comfort
,
and
to
darken
the
room
,
and
to
screen
her
from
the
blaze
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
when
the
boy
returned
,
she
was
sleeping
peacefully
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
capital
!
"
<EOS>
he
whispered
,
giving
Solomon
such
a
hug
that
it
squeezed
a
new
expression
into
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
Now
I
'm
off
.
<EOS>
I
'll
just
take
a
crust
of
bread
with
me
,
for
I
'm
very
hungry
---
and
---
do
n't
wake
her
,
Uncle
Sol
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Solomon
.
<EOS>
Pretty
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
,
indeed
!
"
cried
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
such
a
face
,
Uncle
Sol
.
<EOS>
Now
I
'm
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
"
said
Solomon
,
greatly
relieved
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Uncle
Sol
,
"
cried
Walter
,
putting
his
face
in
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
he
is
again
,
"
said
Solomon
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
does
she
look
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
happy
,
"
said
Solomon
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
famous
!
<EOS>
now
I
'm
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
are
,
"
said
Solomon
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Uncle
Sol
,
"
cried
Walter
,
reappearing
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
he
is
again
!
"
said
Solomon
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
met
Mr
Carker
the
junior
in
the
street
,
queerer
than
ever
.
<EOS>
He
bade
me
good
-
bye
,
but
came
behind
us
here
<EOS>
---
there
's
an
odd
thing
!
<EOS>
---
for
when
we
reached
the
shop
door
,
I
looked
round
,
and
saw
him
going
quietly
away
,
like
a
servant
who
had
seen
me
home
,
or
a
faithful
dog
.
<EOS>
How
does
she
look
now
,
uncle
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
much
the
same
as
before
,
Wally
,
"
replied
Uncle
Sol
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
.
<EOS>
Now
I
am
off
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
this
time
he
really
was
:
and
Solomon
Gills
,
<EOS>
with
no
appetite
for
dinner
,
sat
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
,
watching
Florence
in
her
slumber
,
building
a
great
many
airy
castles
of
the
most
fantastic
architecture
;
and
looking
,
in
the
dim
shade
,
and
in
the
close
vicinity
of
all
the
instruments
,
like
a
magician
disguised
in
a
Welsh
wig
and
a
suit
of
coffee
colour
,
who
held
the
child
in
an
enchanted
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
Walter
proceeded
towards
Mr
Dombey
's
house
at
a
pace
seldom
achieved
by
a
hack
horse
from
the
stand
;
and
yet
with
his
head
out
of
window
every
two
or
three
minutes
,
in
impatient
remonstrance
with
the
driver
.
<EOS>
Arriving
at
his
journey
's
end
,
he
leaped
out
,
and
breathlessly
announcing
his
errand
to
the
servant
,
followed
him
straight
into
the
library
,
where
there
was
a
great
confusion
of
tongues
,
and
where
Mr
Dombey
,
his
sister
,
and
Miss
Tox
,
Richards
,
and
Nipper
,
were
all
congregated
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Sir
,
"
said
Walter
,
rushing
up
to
him
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
'm
happy
to
say
it
's
all
right
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Miss
Dombey
's
found
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
with
his
open
face
,
and
flowing
hair
,
and
sparkling
eyes
,
panting
with
pleasure
and
excitement
,
was
wonderfully
opposed
to
Mr
Dombey
,
as
he
sat
confronting
him
in
his
library
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
,
Louisa
,
that
she
would
certainly
be
found
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
looking
slightly
over
his
shoulder
at
that
lady
,
who
wept
in
company
with
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
Let
the
servants
know
that
no
further
steps
are
necessary
.
<EOS>
This
boy
who
brings
the
information
,
is
young
Gay
,
from
the
office
.
<EOS>
How
was
my
daughter
found
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
I
know
how
she
was
lost
.
<EOS>
"
Here
he
looked
majestically
at
Richards
.
"
<EOS>
But
how
was
she
found
?
<EOS>
Who
found
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
believe
I
found
Miss
dombey
,
Sir
,
"
said
Walter
modestly
;
"
at
least
I
do
n't
know
that
I
can
claim
the
merit
of
having
exactly
found
her
,
Sir
,
but
I
was
the
fortunate
instrument
of
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
What
do
you
mean
,
Sir
,
"
interrupted
Mr
Dombey
,
regarding
the
boy
's
evident
pride
and
pleasure
in
his
share
of
the
transaction
with
an
instinctive
dislike
,
"
by
not
having
exactly
found
my
daughter
,
and
by
being
a
fortunate
instrument
?
<EOS>
Be
plain
and
coherent
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
quite
out
of
Walter
's
power
to
be
coherent
;
but
he
rendered
himself
as
explanatory
as
he
could
,
in
his
breathless
state
,
and
stated
why
he
had
come
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
hear
this
,
girl
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
sternly
to
the
black
-
eyed
.
<EOS>
"
Take
what
is
necessary
,
and
return
immediately
with
this
young
man
to
fetch
Miss
Florence
home
.
<EOS>
Gay
,
you
will
be
rewarded
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
thank
you
,
Sir
,
"
said
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
was
not
thinking
of
any
reward
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
boy
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
suddenly
and
almost
fiercely
;
"
and
what
you
think
of
,
or
affect
to
think
of
,
is
of
little
consequence
.
<EOS>
You
have
done
well
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
undo
it
.
<EOS>
Louisa
,
please
to
give
the
lad
some
wine
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
glance
followed
Walter
Gay
with
sharp
disfavour
,
as
he
left
the
room
under
the
pilotage
of
Mrs
Chick
;
and
it
may
be
that
his
mind
's
eye
followed
him
with
no
greater
relish
,
as
he
rode
back
to
his
uncle
's
with
Miss
Susan
Nipper
.
  
<EOS>
There
they
found
that
Florence
,
much
refreshed
by
sleep
,
had
dined
,
and
greatly
improved
the
acquaintance
of
Solomon
Gills
,
with
whom
she
was
on
terms
of
perfect
confidence
and
ease
.
<EOS>
The
black
-
eyed
(
who
had
cried
so
much
that
she
might
now
be
called
the
red
-
eyed
,
and
who
was
very
silent
and
depressed
)
caught
her
in
her
arms
without
a
word
of
contradiction
or
reproach
,
and
made
a
very
hysterical
meeting
of
it
.
<EOS>
Then
converting
the
parlour
,
for
the
nonce
,
into
a
private
tiring
room
,
she
dressed
her
,
with
great
care
,
in
proper
clothes
;
and
presently
led
her
forth
,
as
like
a
Dombey
as
her
natural
disqualifications
admitted
of
her
being
made
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
!
"
said
Florence
,
running
up
to
Solomon
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
very
good
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Old
Sol
was
quite
delighted
,
and
kissed
her
like
her
grandfather
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
Walter
!
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
<EOS>
"
said
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
!
<EOS>
"
said
Walter
,
giving
both
his
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
never
forget
you
,
"
pursued
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
indeed
I
never
will
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
Walter
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
innocence
of
her
grateful
heart
,
the
child
lifted
up
her
face
to
his
.
<EOS>
Walter
,
bending
down
his
own
,
raised
it
again
,
all
red
and
burning
;
and
looked
at
Uncle
Sol
,
quite
sheepishly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
's
Walter
?
"
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
Walter
!
"
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
Walter
!
"
<EOS>
"
Shake
hands
once
more
,
Walter
!
<EOS>
"
This
was
still
Florence
's
cry
,
after
she
was
shut
up
with
her
little
maid
,
in
the
coach
.
<EOS>
And
when
the
coach
at
length
moved
off
,
Walter
on
the
door
-
step
gaily
returned
the
waving
of
her
handkerchief
,
while
the
wooden
midshipman
behind
him
seemed
,
like
himself
,
intent
upon
that
coach
alone
,
excluding
all
the
other
passing
coaches
from
his
observation
.
  
<EOS>
In
good
time
Mr
Dombey
's
mansion
was
gained
again
,
and
again
there
was
a
noise
of
tongues
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
Again
,
too
,
the
coach
was
ordered
to
wait
---
"
for
Mrs
Richards
,
"
one
of
Susan
's
fellow
-
servants
ominously
whispered
,
as
she
passed
with
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
The
entrance
of
the
lost
child
made
a
slight
sensation
,
but
not
much
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
who
had
never
found
her
,
kissed
her
once
upon
the
forehead
,
and
cautioned
her
not
to
run
away
again
,
or
wander
anywhere
with
treacherous
attendants
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
stopped
in
her
lamentations
on
the
corruption
of
human
nature
,
even
when
beckoned
to
the
paths
of
virtue
by
a
Charitable
Grinder
;
and
received
her
with
a
welcome
something
short
of
the
reception
due
to
none
but
perfect
Dombeys
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
regulated
her
feelings
by
the
models
before
her
.
<EOS>
Richards
,
the
culprit
Richards
,
alone
poured
out
her
heart
in
broken
words
of
welcome
,
and
bowed
herself
over
the
little
wandering
head
as
if
she
really
loved
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Richards
!
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
with
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
been
much
more
satisfactory
to
those
who
wish
to
think
well
of
their
fellow
creatures
,
and
much
more
becoming
in
you
,
if
you
had
shown
some
proper
feeling
,
in
time
,
for
the
little
child
that
is
now
going
to
be
prematurely
deprived
of
its
natural
nourishment
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cut
off
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
in
a
plaintive
whisper
,
"
from
one
common
fountain
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
was
my
ungrateful
case
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
solemnly
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
had
your
reflections
,
Richards
<EOS>
,
I
should
feel
as
if
the
Charitable
Grinders
'
dress
would
blight
my
child
,
and
the
education
choke
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
the
matter
of
that
---
but
Mrs
Chick
did
n't
know
it
<EOS>
---
he
had
been
pretty
well
blighted
by
the
dress
already
;
and
as
to
the
education
,
even
its
retributive
effect
might
be
produced
in
time
,
for
it
was
a
storm
of
sobs
and
blows
.
  
<EOS>
"
Louisa
!
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
necessary
to
prolong
these
observations
.
<EOS>
The
woman
is
discharged
and
paid
.
<EOS>
You
leave
this
house
,
Richards
,
for
taking
my
son
---
my
son
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
emphatically
repeating
these
two
words
,
"
into
haunts
and
into
society
which
are
not
to
be
thought
of
without
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
accident
which
befel
Miss
Florence
this
morning
,
I
regard
that
as
,
in
one
great
sense
,
a
happy
and
fortunate
circumstance
;
inasmuch
as
,
but
for
that
occurrence
,
I
never
could
have
known
---
and
from
your
own
lips
too
---
of
what
you
had
been
guilty
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
Louisa
,
the
other
nurse
,
the
young
person
,
"
here
Miss
Nipper
sobbed
aloud
,
"
being
so
much
younger
,
and
necessarily
influenced
by
Paul
's
nurse
,
may
remain
.
<EOS>
Have
the
goodness
to
direct
that
this
woman
's
coach
is
paid
to
"
---
Mr
Dombey
stopped
and
winced
---
"
to
Staggs
's
Gardens
.
"
  
<EOS>
Polly
moved
towards
the
door
,
with
Florence
holding
to
her
dress
,
and
crying
to
her
in
the
most
pathetic
manner
not
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
dagger
in
the
haughty
father
's
heart
,
an
arrow
in
his
brain
,
to
see
how
the
flesh
and
blood
he
could
not
disown
,
clung
to
this
obscure
stranger
,
and
he
sitting
by
.
<EOS>
Not
that
he
cared
to
whom
his
daughter
turned
,
or
from
whom
turned
away
.
<EOS>
The
swift
sharp
agony
struck
through
him
,
as
he
thought
of
what
his
son
might
do
.
  
<EOS>
His
son
cried
lustily
that
night
,
at
all
events
.
<EOS>
Sooth
to
say
,
poor
Paul
had
better
reason
for
his
tears
than
sons
of
that
age
often
have
,
for
he
had
lost
his
second
mother
---
<EOS>
his
first
,
so
far
as
he
knew
---
by
a
stroke
as
sudden
as
that
natural
affliction
which
had
darkened
the
beginning
of
his

At

his

A
Bird's

Glimpse
of
Miss
Tox
's
Dwelling
-
place
;
also
of
the
State
of
Miss
Tox
's
Affections
 
<EOS>
MISS
TOX
inhabited
a
dark
little
house
that
had
been
squeezed
,
at
some
remote
period
of
English
History
,
into
a
fashionable
neighbourhood
at
the
west
end
of
the
town
,
where
it
stood
in
the
shad
like
a
poor
relation
of
the
great
street
round
the
corner
,
coldly
looked
down
upon
by
mighty
mansions
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
exactly
in
a
court
,
and
it
was
not
exactly
in
a
yard
;
but
it
was
in
the
dullest
of
No
-
Thoroughfares
,
rendered
anxious
and
haggard
by
distant
double
knocks
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
this
retirement
,
where
grass
grew
between
the
chinks
in
the
stone
pavement
,
was
Princess
's
Place
;
and
in
Princess
's
Place
was
Princess
's
Chapel
,
with
a
tinkling
bell
,
where
sometimes
as
many
as
five
-
and
-
twenty
people
attended
service
on
a
Sunday
.
<EOS>
The
Princess
's
Arms
was
also
there
,
and
much
resorted
to
by
splendid
footmen
.
<EOS>
A
sedan
chair
was
kept
inside
the
railing
before
the
Princess
's
Arms
,
but
it
had
never
come
out
within
the
memory
of
man
;
and
on
fine
mornings
,
the
top
of
every
rail
(
there
were
eight
-
and
-
forty
,
as
Miss
Tox
had
often
counted
)
was
decorated
with
a
pewter
-
pot
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
another
private
house
besides
Miss
Tox
's
in
Princess
's
Place
:
not
to
mention
an
immense
pair
of
gates
,
with
an
immense
pair
of
lion
-
headed
knockers
on
them
,
which
were
never
opened
by
any
chance
,
and
were
supposed
to
constitute
a
disused
entrance
to
somebody
's
stables
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
there
was
a
smack
of
stabling
in
the
air
of
Princess
's
Place
;
and
Miss
Tox
's
bedroom
(
which
was
at
the
back
)
commanded
a
vista
of
Mews
,
where
hostlers
,
at
whatever
sort
of
work
engaged
,
were
continually
accompanying
themselves
with
effervescent
noises
;
and
where
the
most
domestic
and
confidential
garments
of
coachmen
and
their
wives
and
families
,
usually
hung
,
like
Macbeth
's
banners
,
on
the
outward
walls
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
other
private
house
in
Princess
's
Place
,
tenanted
by
a
retired
butler
who
had
married
a
housekeeper
,
apartments
were
let
Furnished
,
to
a
single
gentleman
:
to
wit
,
a
wooden
-
featured
,
blue
-
faced
Major
,
with
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
,
in
whom
Miss
Tox
recognised
,
as
she
herself
expressed
it
,
"
something
so
truly
military
;
"
and
between
whom
and
herself
,
an
occasional
interchange
of
newspapers
and
pamphlets
,
and
such
Platonic
dalliance
,
was
effected
through
the
medium
of
a
dark
servant
of
the
Major
's
,
who
Miss
Tox
was
quite
content
to
classify
as
a
"
native
,
"
without
connecting
him
with
any
geographical
idea
whatever
.
   
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
never
was
a
smaller
entry
and
staircase
,
than
the
entry
and
staircase
of
Miss
Tox
's
house
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
taken
altogether
,
from
top
to
bottom
,
it
was
the
most
inconvenient
little
house
in
England
,
and
the
crookedest
;
but
then
,
Miss
Tox
said
,
<EOS>
what
a
situation
!
<EOS>
There
was
very
little
daylight
to
be
got
there
in
the
winter
:
<EOS>
no
sun
at
the
best
of
times
<EOS>
:
air
was
out
of
the
question
,
and
traffic
was
walled
out
.
<EOS>
Still
Miss
Tox
said
,
think
of
the
situation
!
<EOS>
So
said
the
blue
-
faced
Major
,
whose
eyes
were
starting
out
of
his
head
:
who
gloried
in
Princess
's
Place
:
and
who
delighted
to
turn
the
conversation
at
his
club
,
whenever
he
could
,
to
something
connected
with
some
of
the
great
people
in
the
great
street
round
the
corner
,
that
he
might
have
the
satisfaction
of
saying
they
were
his
neighbours
.
  
<EOS>
The
dingy
tenement
inhabited
by
Miss
Tox
was
her
own
;
having
been
devised
and
bequeathed
to
her
by
the
deceased
owner
of
the
fishy
eye
in
the
locket
,
of
whom
a
miniature
portrait
,
with
a
powdered
head
and
a
pigtail
,
balanced
the
kettleholder
on
opposite
sides
of
the
parlour
fireplace
.
<EOS>
The
greater
part
of
the
furniture
was
of
the
powdered
-
head
and
pig
-
tail
period
:
comprising
a
platewarmer
,
always
languishing
and
sprawling
its
four
attenuated
bow
legs
in
somebody
's
way
;
and
an
obsolete
harpsichord
,
illuminated
round
the
maker
's
name
with
a
painted
garland
of
sweet
peas
.
  
<EOS>
Although
Major
Bagstock
had
arrived
at
what
is
called
in
polite
literature
,
the
grand
meridian
of
life
,
and
was
proceeding
on
his
journey
down
-
hill
with
hardly
any
throat
,
and
a
very
rigid
pair
of
jaw
-
bones
,
and
long
-
flapped
elephantine
ears
,
and
his
eyes
and
complexion
in
the
state
of
artificial
excitement
already
mentioned
,
he
was
mightily
proud
of
awakening
an
interest
in
Miss
Tox
,
and
tickled
his
vanity
with
the
fiction
that
she
was
a
splendid
woman
,
who
had
her
eye
on
him
.
<EOS>
This
he
had
several
times
hinted
at
the
club
:
in
connexion
with
little
jocularities
,
of
which
old
Joe
Bagstock
,
old
Joey
Bagstock
,
old
J
Bagstock
,
old
Josh
Bagstock
,
or
so
forth
,
was
the
perpetual
theme
:
<EOS>
it
being
,
as
it
were
,
the
Major
's
stronghold
and
donjon
-
keep
of
light
humour
,
to
be
on
the
most
familiar
terms
with
his
own
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
Joey
B
,
Sir
,
"
the
Major
would
say
,
with
a
flourish
of
his
walking
-
stick
,
"
is
worth
a
dozen
of
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
a
few
more
of
the
Bagstock
breed
among
you
,
Sir
,
you
'd
be
none
the
worse
for
it
.
<EOS>
Old
Joe
,
Sir
,
need
n't
look
far
for
a
wife
even
now
,
if
he
was
on
the
look
-
out
;
but
he
's
hard
-
hearted
,
Sir
,
is
Joe
---
he
's
tough
,
Sir
,
tough
,
and
de
-
vilish
sly
!
"
<EOS>
After
such
a
declaration
wheezing
sounds
would
be
heard
;
and
the
Major
's
blue
would
deepen
into
purple
,
while
his
eyes
strained
and
started
convulsively
.
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
his
very
liberal
laudation
of
himself
,
however
,
the
Major
was
selfish
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
doubted
whether
there
ever
was
a
more
entirely
selfish
person
at
heart
;
or
at
stomach
is
perhaps
a
better
expression
,
seeing
that
he
was
more
decidedly
endowed
with
that
latter
organ
than
with
the
former
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
idea
of
being
overlooked
or
slighted
by
anybody
;
least
of
all
,
had
he
the
remotest
comprehension
of
being
over
-
looked
and
slighted
by
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
,
Miss
Tox
,
as
it
appeared
,
forgot
him
---
gradually
forgot
him
.
<EOS>
She
began
to
forget
him
soon
after
her
discovery
of
the
Toodle
family
.
<EOS>
She
continued
to
forget
him
up
to
the
time
of
the
christening
.
<EOS>
She
went
on
forgetting
him
with
compound
interest
after
that
.
<EOS>
Something
or
somebody
had
superseded
him
as
a
source
of
interest
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
morning
,
Ma'am
,
"
said
the
Major
,
meeting
Miss
Tox
in
Princess
's
Place
,
some
weeks
after
the
changes
chronicled
in
the
last
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
morning
,
Sir
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
;
very
coldly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Joe
Bagstock
,
Ma'am
,
"
observed
the
Major
,
with
his
usual
gallantry
,
"
has
not
had
the
happiness
of
bowing
to
you
at
your
window
,
for
a
considerable
period
.
<EOS>
Joe
has
been
hardly
used
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
His
sun
has
been
behind
a
cloud
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
inclined
her
head
;
but
very
coldly
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Joe
's
luminary
has
been
out
of
town
,
Ma'am
,
perhaps
,
"
inquired
the
Major
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
?
out
of
town
?
<EOS>
oh
no
,
I
have
not
been
out
of
town
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
much
engaged
lately
.
<EOS>
My
time
is
nearly
all
devoted
to
some
very
intimate
friends
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
I
have
none
to
spare
,
even
now
.
<EOS>
Good
morning
,
Sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
Miss
Tox
,
with
her
most
fascinating
step
and
carriage
,
disappeared
from
Princess
's
Place
,
the
Major
stood
looking
after
her
with
a
bluer
face
than
ever
:
muttering
and
growling
some
not
at
all
complimentary
remarks
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
damme
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Major
,
rolling
his
lobster
eyes
round
and
round
Princess
's
Place
,
and
apostrophizing
its
fragrant
air
,
"
six
months
ago
<EOS>
,
the
woman
loved
the
ground
Joe
Bagstock
walked
on
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
meaning
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
decided
,
after
some
consideration
,
that
it
meant
man
-
traps
;
that
it
meant
plotting
and
snaring
;
that
Miss
Tox
was
digging
pitfalls
.
"
<EOS>
But
you
wo
n't
catch
Joe
,
Ma'am
,
"
said
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
tough
,
Ma'am
,
tough
,
is
JB
.
<EOS>
Tough
,
and
de
-
vilish
sly
!
"
<EOS>
over
which
reflection
he
chuckled
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
But
still
,
when
that
day
and
many
other
days
were
gone
and
past
,
it
seemed
that
Miss
Tox
took
no
heed
whatever
of
the
Major
,
and
thought
nothing
at
all
about
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
wo
nt
,
once
upon
a
time
,
to
look
out
at
one
of
her
little
dark
windows
by
accident
,
and
blushingly
return
the
Major
's
greeting
;
but
now
,
she
never
gave
the
Major
a
chance
,
and
cared
nothing
at
all
whether
he
looked
over
the
way
or
not
.
<EOS>
Other
changes
had
come
to
pass
too
.
<EOS>
The
Major
,
standing
in
the
shade
of
his
own
apartment
,
could
make
out
that
an
air
of
greater
smartness
had
recently
come
over
Miss
Tox
's
house
;
that
a
new
cage
with
gilded
wires
had
been
provided
for
the
ancient
little
canary
bird
;
that
divers
ornaments
,
cut
out
of
coloured
card
-
boards
and
paper
,
seemed
to
decorate
the
chimney
-
piece
and
tables
;
that
a
plant
or
two
had
suddenly
sprung
up
in
the
windows
;
that
Miss
Tox
occasionally
practised
on
the
harpsichord
,
whose
garland
of
sweet
peas
was
always
displayed
ostentatiously
,
crowned
with
the
Copenhagen
and
Bird
Waltzes
in
a
Music
Book
of
Miss
Tox
's
own
copying
.
  
<EOS>
Over
and
above
all
this
,
Miss
Tox
had
long
been
dressed
with
uncommon
care
and
elegance
in
slight
mourning
.
<EOS>
But
this
helped
the
Major
out
of
his
difficulty
;
and
he
determined
within
himself
that
she
had
come
into
a
small
legacy
,
and
grown
proud
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
very
next
day
after
he
had
eased
his
mind
by
arriving
at
this
decision
,
that
the
Major
,
sitting
at
his
breakfast
,
saw
an
apparition
so
tremendous
and
wonderful
in
Miss
Tox
's
little
drawing
-
room
,
that
he
remained
for
some
time
rooted
to
his
chair
;
then
,
rushing
into
the
next
room
,
returned
with
a
double
-
barrelled
opera
-
glass
,
through
which
he
surveyed
it
intently
for
some
minutes
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
Baby
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Major
,
shutting
up
the
glass
again
,
"
for
fifty
thousand
pounds
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
could
n't
forget
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
do
nothing
but
whistle
,
and
stare
to
that
extent
,
that
his
eyes
compared
with
what
they
now
became
,
had
been
in
former
times
quite
cavernous
and
sunken
.
<EOS>
Day
after
day
,
two
,
three
,
four
times
a
week
,
this
Baby
reappeared
.
<EOS>
The
Major
continued
to
stare
and
whistle
.
<EOS>
To
all
other
intents
and
purposes
he
was
alone
in
Princess
's
Place
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
has
ceased
to
mind
what
he
did
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
been
black
as
well
as
blue
,
and
it
would
have
been
of
no
consequence
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
perseverance
with
which
she
walked
out
of
Princess
's
Place
to
fetch
this
baby
and
its
nurse
,
and
walked
back
with
them
,
and
walked
home
with
them
again
,
and
continually
mounted
guard
over
them
;
and
the
perseverance
with
which
she
nursed
it
herself
,
and
fed
it
,
and
played
with
it
,
and
froze
its
young
blood
with
airs
upon
the
harpsichord
;
was
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
At
about
this
same
period
,
too
,
she
was
seized
with
a
passion
for
looking
at
a
certain
bracelet
;
also
with
a
passion
for
looking
at
the
moon
,
of
which
she
would
take
long
observations
from
her
chamber
window
.
<EOS>
But
whatever
she
looked
at
;
sun
,
moon
,
stars
,
or
bracelet
;
she
looked
no
more
at
the
Major
.
<EOS>
And
the
Major
whistled
,
and
stared
,
and
wondered
,
and
dodged
about
his
room
,
and
could
make
nothing
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
quite
win
my
brother
Paul
's
heart
,
and
that
's
the
truth
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
one
day
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
turned
pale
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
grows
more
like
Paul
every
day
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
returned
no
other
reply
than
by
taking
the
little
Paul
in
her
arms
,
and
making
his
cockade
perfectly
flat
and
limp
with
her
caresses
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
mother
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
"
whose
acquaintance
I
was
to
have
made
through
you
,
<EOS>
does
he
at
all
resemble
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
at
all
,
"
returned
Louisa
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
---
she
was
pretty
,
I
believe
?
"
<EOS>
faltered
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
poor
dear
Fanny
was
interesting
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
after
some
judicial
consideration
.
"
<EOS>
Certainly
interesting
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
that
air
of
commanding
superiority
which
one
would
somehow
expect
,
almost
as
a
matter
of
course
,
to
find
in
my
brother
's
wife
;
nor
had
she
that
strength
and
vigour

Miss
Tox
heaved
a
deep
sigh
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
she
was
pleasing
:
"
said
Mrs
Chick
:
"
<EOS>
extremely
so
.
<EOS>
And
she
meant
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
,
how
well
poor
Fanny
meant
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You

cried
Miss

to
little
Paul

You

If
the
Major
could
have
known
how
many
hopes
and
ventures
,
what
a
multitude
of
plans
and
speculations
,
rested
on
that
baby
head
;
and
could
have
seen
them
hovering
,
in
all
their
heterogeneous
confusion
and
disorder
,
round
the
puckered
cap
of
the
unconscious
little
Paul
;
he
might
have
stared
indeed
.
<EOS>
Then
would
he
have
recognised
,
among
the
crowd
,
some
few
ambitious
motes
and
beams
belonging
to
Miss
Tox
;
then
would
he
perhaps
have
understood
the
nature
of
that
lady
's
faltering
investment
in
the
Dombey
Firm
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
child
himself
could
have
awakened
in
the
night
,
and
seen
,
gathered
about
his
cradle
-
curtains
,
faint
reflections
of
the
dreams
that
other
people
had
of
him
,
they
might
have
scared
him
,
with
good
reason
.
<EOS>
But
he
slumbered
on
,
alike
unconscious
of
the
kind
intentions
of
Miss
Tox
,
the
wonder
of
the
Major
,
the
early
sorrows
of
his
sister
,
and
the
stern
visions
of
his
father
;
and
innocent
that
any
spot
of
earth
contained
a
Dombey
or
a
Son

Progress

BENEATH
the
watching
and
attentive
eyes
of
Time
---
so
far
another
Major
<EOS>
---
Paul
's
slumbers
gradually
changed
.
<EOS>
More
and
more
light
broke
in
upon
them
;
distincter
and
distincter
dreams
disturbed
them
;
an
accumulating
crowd
of
objects
and
impressions
swarmed
about
his
rest
;
and
so
he
passed
from
babyhood
to
childhood
,
and
became
a
talking
,
walking
,
wondering
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
downfall
and
banishment
of
Richards
,
the
nursery
may
be
said
to
have
been
put
into
commission
:
as
a
Public
Department
is
sometimes
,
when
no
individual
Atlas
can
be
found
to
support
it
.
<EOS>
The
Commissioners
were
,
of
course
,
Mrs
Chick
and
Miss
Tox
:
who
devoted
themselves
to
their
duties
with
such
astonishing
ardour
that
Major
Bagstock
had
every
day
some
new
reminder
of
his
being
forsaken
,
while
Mr
Chick
,
bereft
of
domestic
supervision
,
cast
himself
upon
the
gay
world
,
dined
at
clubs
and
coffee
-
houses
,
smelt
of
smoke
on
three
different
occasions
,
went
to
the
play
by
himself
,
and
in
short
,
loosened
(
as
Mrs
Chick
once
told
him
)
every
social
bond
,
and
moral
obligation
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
,
in
spite
of
his
early
promise
,
all
this
vigilance
and
care
could
not
make
little
Paul
a
thriving
boy
.
<EOS>
Naturally
delicate
,
perhaps
,
he
pined
and
wasted
after
the
dismissal
of
his
nurse
,
and
,
for
a
long
time
,
seemed
but
to
wait
his
opportunity
of
gliding
through
their
hands
,
and
seeking
his
lost
mother
.
<EOS>
This
dangerous
ground
in
his
steeple
-
chase
towards
manhood
passed
,
he
still
found
it
very
rough
riding
,
and
was
grievously
beset
by
all
the
obstacles
in
his
course
.
<EOS>
Every
tooth
was
a
break
-
neck
fence
,
and
every
pimple
in
the
measles
a
stone
wall
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
down
in
every
fit
of
the
hooping
-
cough
,
and
rolled
upon
and
crushed
by
a
whole
field
of
small
diseases
,
that
came
trooping
on
each
other
's
heels
to
prevent
his
getting
up
again
.
<EOS>
Some
bird
of
prey
got
into
his
throat
instead
of
the
thrush
;
and
the
very
chickens
turning
ferocious
---
if
they
have
anything
to
do
with
that
infant
malady
to
which
they
lend
their
name
---
worried
him
like
tiger
-
cats
.
  
<EOS>
The
chill
of
Paul
's
christening
had
struck
home
,
perhaps
to
some
sensitive
part
of
his
nature
,
which
could
not
recover
itself
in
the
cold
shade
of
his
father
;
but
he
was
an
unfortunate
child
from
that
day
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Wickam
often
said
she
never
see
a
dear
so
put
upon
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Wickam
was
a
waiter
's
wife
---
which
would
seem
equivalent
to
being
any
other
man
's
widow
---
whose
application
for
an
engagement
in
Mr
Dombey
's
service
had
been
favourably
considered
,
on
account
of
the
apparent
impossibility
of
her
having
any
followers
,
or
any
one
to
follow
;
and
who
,
from
within
a
day
or
two
of
Paul
's
sharp
weaning
,
had
been
engaged
as
his
nurse
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Wickam
was
a
meek
woman
,
of
a
fair
complexion
,
with
her
eyebrows
always
elevated
,
and
her
head
always
drooping
;
who
was
always
ready
to
pity
herself
,
or
to
be
pitied
,
or
to
pity
anybody
else
;
and
who
had
a
surprising
natural
gift
of
viewing
all
subjects
in
an
utterly
forlorn
and
pitiable
light
,
and
bringing
dreadful
precedents
to
bear
upon
them
,
and
deriving
the
greatest
consolation
from
the
exercise
of
that
talent
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
hardly
necessary
to
observe
,
that
no
touch
of
this
quality
ever
reached
the
magnificent
knowledge
of
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
remarkable
,
indeed
,
if
any
had
;
when
no
one
in
the
house
---
not
even
Mrs
Chick
or
Miss
Tox
---
dared
ever
whisper
to
him
that
there
had
,
on
any
one
occasion
,
been
the
least
reason
for
uneasiness
in
reference
to
little
Paul
.
<EOS>
He
had
settled
,
within
himself
,
that
the
child
must
necessarily
pass
through
a
certain
routine
of
minor
maladies
,
and
that
the
sooner
he
did
so
the
better
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
have
bought
him
off
,
or
provided
a
substitute
,
as
in
the
case
of
an
unlucky
drawing
for
the
militia
,
he
would
have
been
glad
to
do
so
on
liberal
terms
.
<EOS>
But
as
this
was
not
feasible
,
he
merely
wondered
,
in
his
haughty
manner
,
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
what
Nature
meant
by
it
;
and
comforted
himself
with
the
reflection
that
there
was
another
milestone
passed
upon
the
road
,
and
that
the
great
end
of
the
journey
lay
so
much
the
nearer
.
<EOS>
For
the
feeling
uppermost
in
his
mind
,
now
and
constantly
intensifying
,
and
increasing
in
it
as
Paul
grew
older
,
was
impatience
.
<EOS>
Impatience
for
the
time
to
come
,
when
his
visions
of
their
united
consequence
and
grandeur
would
be
triumphantly
realized
.
  
<EOS>
Some
Philosophers
tell
us
that
selfishness
is
at
the
root
of
our
best
loves
and
affections
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
young
child
was
,
from
the
beginning
,
so
distinctly
important
to
him
as
a
part
of
his
own
greatness
,
or
(
which
is
the
same
thing
)
of
the
greatness
of
Dombey
and
Son
,
that
there
is
no
doubt
his
parental
affection
might
have
been
easily
traced
,
like
many
a
goodly
super
-
structure
of
fair
fame
,
to
a
very
low
foundation
.
<EOS>
But
he
loved
his
son
with
all
the
love
he
had
.
<EOS>
If
there
were
a
warm
place
in
his
frosty
heart
,
his
son
occupied
it
;
if
its
very
hard
surface
could
receive
the
impression
of
any
image
,
the
image
of
that
son
was
there
;
though
not
so
much
as
an
infant
,
or
as
a
boy
,
but
as
a
grown
man
---
the
"
Son
"
of
the
Firm
.
<EOS>
Therefore
he
was
impatient
to
advance
into
the
future
,
and
to
hurry
over
the
intervening
passages
of
his
history
.
<EOS>
Therefore
he
had
little
or
no
anxiety
about
them
,
in
spite
of
his
love
;
feeling
as
if
the
boy
had
a
charmed
life
,
and
must
become
the
man
with
whom
he
held
such
constant
communication
in
his
thoughts
,
and
for
whom
he
planned
and
projected
,
as
for
an
existing
reality
,
every
day
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
Paul
grew
to
be
nearly
five
years
old
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
pretty
little
fellow
;
though
there
was
something
wan
and
wistful
in
his
small
face
,
that
gave
occasion
to
many
significant
shakes
of
Mrs
Wickam
's
head
,
and
many
long
-
drawn
inspirations
of
Mrs
Wickam
's
breath
.
<EOS>
His
temper
gave
abundant
promise
of
being
imperious
in
after
-
life
;
and
he
had
as
hopeful
an
apprehension
of
his
own
importance
,
and
the
rightful
subservience
of
all
other
things
and
persons
to
it
,
as
heart
could
desire
.
<EOS>
He
was
childish
and
sportive
enough
at
times
,
and
not
of
a
sullen
disposition
;
but
he
had
a
strange
,
old
-
fashioned
,
thoughtful
way
,
at
other
times
,
of
sitting
brooding
in
his
miniature
armchair
,
when
he
looked
(
and
talked
)
like
one
of
those
terrible
little
Beings
in
the
Fairy
tales
,
who
,
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
or
two
hundred
years
of
age
,
fantastically
represent
the
children
for
whom
they
have
been
substituted
.
<EOS>
He
would
frequently
be
stricken
with
this
precocious
mood
upstairs
in
the
nursery
;
and
would
sometimes
lapse
into
it
suddenly
,
exclaiming
that
he
was
tired
:
even
while
playing
with
Florence
,
or
driving
Miss
Tox
in
single
harness
.
<EOS>
But
at
no
time
did
he
fall
into
it
so
surely
,
as
when
,
his
little
chair
being
carried
down
into
his
father
's
room
,
he
sat
there
with
him
after
dinner
,
by
the
fire
.
<EOS>
They
were
the
strangest
pair
at
such
a
time
that
ever
firelight
shone
upon
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
so
erect
and
solemn
,
gazing
at
the
blaze
;
his
little
image
,
with
an
old
,
old
face
,
peering
into
the
red
perspective
with
the
fixed
and
rapt
attention
of
a
sage
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
entertaining
complicated
worldly
schemes
and
plans
;
the
little
image
entertaining
Heaven
knows
what
wild
fancies
,
half
-
formed
thoughts
,
and
wandering
speculations
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
stiff
with
starch
and
arrogance
;
the
little
image
by
inheritance
,
and
in
unconscious
imitation
.
<EOS>
The
two
so
very
much
alike
,
and
yet
so
monstrously
contrasted
.
  
<EOS>
On
one
of
these
occasions
,
when
they
had
both
been
perfectly
quiet
for
a
long
time
,
and
Mr
Dombey
only
knew
that
the
child
was
awake
by
occasionally
glancing
at
his
eye
,
where
the
bright
fire
was
sparkling
like
a
jewel
,
little
Paul
broke
silence
thus
:
  
"
Papa
!
<EOS>
what
's
money
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
abrupt
question
had
such
immediate
reference
to
the
subject
of
Mr
Dombey
's
thoughts
,
that
Mr
Dombey
was
quite
disconcerted
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
money
,
Paul
?
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Money
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
child
,
laying
his
hands
upon
the
elbows
of
his
little
chair
,
and
turning
the
old
face
up
towards
Mr
Dombey
's
;
"
what
is
money
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
was
in
a
difficulty
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
liked
to
give
him
some
explanation
involving
the
terms
circulating
-
medium
,
currency
,
depreciation
of
currency
,
paper
,
bullion
,
rates
of
exchange
,
value
of
precious
metals
in
the
market
,
and
so
forth
;
but
looking
down
at
the
little
chair
,
and
seeing
what
a
long
way
down
it
was
,
he
answered
:
"
Gold
,
and
silver
,
and
copper
.
<EOS>
Guineas
,
shillings
,
half
-
pence
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
they
are
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
I
know
what
they
are
,
"
said
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
that
,
Papa
.
<EOS>
I
mean
what
's
money
after
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
Heaven
and
Earth
<EOS>
,
how
old
his
face
was
as
he
turned
it
up
again
towards
his
father
's
!
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
money
after
all
!
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
backing
his
chair
a
little
,
that
he
might
the
better
gaze
in
sheer
amazement
at
the
presumptuous
atom
that
propounded
such
an
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
Papa
,
what
can
it
do
?
"
returned
Paul
,
folding
his
arms
(
they
were
hardly
long
enough
to
fold
)
,
and
looking
at
the
fire
,
and
up
at
him
,
and
at
the
fire
,
and
up
at
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
drew
his
chair
back
to
its
former
place
,
and
patted
him
on
the
head
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
know
better
by
-
and
-
by
,
my
man
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Money
,
Paul
,
can
do
anything
.
"
<EOS>
He
took
hold
of
the
little
hand
,
and
beat
it
softly
against
one
of
his
own
,
as
he
said
so
.
  
<EOS>
But
Paul
got
his
hand
free
as
soon
as
he
could
;
and
rubbing
it
gently
to
and
fro
on
the
elbow
of
his
chair
,
as
if
his
wit
were
in
the
palm
,
and
he
were
sharpening
it
---
and
looking
at
the
fire
again
,
as
though
the
fire
had
been
his
adviser
and
prompter
---
<EOS>
repeated
,
after
a
short
pause
:
   
<EOS>
"
Anything
,
Papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Anything
---
almost
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anything
means
everything
,
do
n't
it
,
Papa
?
"
asked
his
son
:
not
observing
,
or
possibly
not
understanding
,
the
qualification
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
includes
it
:
<EOS>
yes
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
money
save
me
my
Mama
?
"
returned
the
child
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
cruel
,
is
it
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Cruel
!
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
settling
his
neckcloth
,
and
seeming
to
resent
the
idea
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
A
good
thing
ca
n't
be
cruel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
's
a
good
thing
,
and
can
do
anything
,
"
said
the
little
fellow
,
thoughtfully
,
as
he
looked
back
at
the
fire
,
"
I
wonder
why
it
did
n't
save
me
my
Mama
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
did
n't
ask
the
question
of
his
father
this
time
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
had
seen
,
with
a
child
's
quickness
,
that
it
had
already
made
his
father
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
But
he
repeated
the
thought
aloud
,
as
if
it
were
quite
an
old
one
to
him
,
and
had
troubled
him
very
much
;
and
sat
with
his
chin
resting
on
his
hand
,
still
cogitating
and
looking
for
an
explanation
in
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
having
recovered
from
his
surprise
,
not
to
say
his
alarm
(
for
it
was
the
very
first
occasion
on
which
the
child
had
ever
broached
the
subject
of
his
mother
to
him
,
though
he
had
had
him
sitting
by
his
side
,
in
this
same
manner
,
evening
after
evening
)
,
expounded
to
him
how
that
money
,
though
a
very
potent
spirit
,
never
to
be
disparaged
on
any
account
whatever
,
could
not
keep
people
alive
whose
time
was
come
to
die
;
and
how
that
we
must
all
die
,
unfortunately
,
even
in
the
City
,
though
we
were
never
so
rich
.
<EOS>
But
how
that
money
caused
us
to
be
honoured
,
feared
,
respected
,
courted
,
and
admired
,
and
made
us
powerful
and
glorious
in
the
eyes
of
all
men
;
and
how
that
it
could
,
very
often
,
even
keep
off
death
,
for
a
long
time
together
.
<EOS>
How
,
for
example
,
it
had
secured
to
his
Mama
the
services
of
Mr
Pilkins
,
by
which
he
,
Paul
,
had
often
profited
himself
;
likewise
of
the
great
Doctor
Parker
Peps
,
whom
he
had
never
known
.
<EOS>
And
how
it
could
do
all
,
that
could
be
done
.
<EOS>
This
,
with
more
to
the
same
purpose
,
Mr
Dombey
instilled
into
the
mind
of
his
son
,
who
listened
attentively
,
and
seemed
to
understand
the
greater
part
of
what
was
said
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
ca
n't
make
me
strong
and
quite
well
,
either
,
Papa
;
can
it
?
"
asked
Paul
,
after
a
short
silence
;
rubbing
his
tiny
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
are
strong
and
quite
well
,
"
returned
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
the
age
of
the
face
that
was
turned
up
again
,
with
an
expression
,
half
of
melancholy
,
half
of
slyness
,
on
it
!
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
as
strong
and
<EOS>
well
as
such
little
people
usually
are
?
<EOS>
Eh
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Florence
is
older
than
I
am
,
but
I
'm
not
as
strong
and
well
as
Florence
,
I
know
,
"
returned
the
child
;
"
but
I
believe
that
when
Florence
was
as
little
as
me
,
she
could
play
a
great
deal
longer
at
a
time
without
tiring
herself
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
tired
sometimes
,
"
said
little
Paul
,
warming
his
hands
,
and
looking
in
between
the
bars
of
the
grate
,
as
if
some
ghostly
puppet
-
show
were
performing
there
,
"
and
my
bones
ache
<EOS>
so
(
Wickam
says
it
's
my
bones
)
,
that
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
<EOS>
But
that
's
at
night
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
drawing
his
own
chair
closer
to
his
son
's
,
and
laying
his
hand
gently
on
his
back
;
"
little
people
should
be
tired
at
night
,
for
then
they
sleep
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
not
at
night
,
Papa
,
"
returned
the
child
,
"
it
's
in
the
day
;
and
I
lie
down
in
Florence
's
lap
,
and
she
sings
to
me
.
<EOS>
At
night
I
dream
about
such
curi
-
ous
things
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
he
went
on
,
warming
his
hands
again
,
and
thinking
about
them
,
like
an
old
man
or
a
young
goblin
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
was
so
astonished
,
and
so
uncomfortable
,
and
so
perfectly
at
loss
how
to
pursue
the
conversation
,
that
he
could
only
sit
looking
at
his
son
by
the
light
of
the
fire
,
with
his
hand
resting
on
his
back
,
as
if
it
were
detained
there
by
some
magnetic
attraction
.
<EOS>
Once
he
advanced
his
other
hand
,
and
turned
the
contemplative
face
towards
his
own
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
But
it
sought
the
fire
again
as
soon
as
he
released
it
;
and
remained
,
addressed
towards
the
flickering
blaze
,
until
the
nurse
appeared
,
to
summon
him
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
Florence
to
come
for
me
,
"
said
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
come
with
your
poor
Nurse
Wickam
,
Master
Paul
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
that
attendant
,
with
great
pathos
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
wo
n't
,
"
replied
Paul
,
composing
himself
in
his
armchair
again
,
like
the
master
of
house
.
  
<EOS>
Invoking
a
blessing
upon
his
innocence
,
Mrs
Wickam
withdrew
,
and
presently
Florence
appeared
in
her
stead
.
<EOS>
The
child
immediately
started
up
with
sudden
readiness
and
animation
,
and
raised
towards
his
father
in
bidding
him
good
night
,
a
countenance
so
much
brighter
,
so
much
younger
,
and
so
much
more
childlike
altogether
,
that
Mr
Dombey
,
while
he
felt
greatly
reassured
by
the
change
,
was
quite
amazed
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
After
they
had
left
the
room
together
,
he
thought
he
heard
a
soft
voice
singing
;
and
remembering
that
Paul
had
said
his
sister
sung
to
him
,
he
had
the
curiosity
to
open
the
door
and
listen
,
and
look
after
them
.
<EOS>
She
was
toiling
up
the
great
,
wide
,
vacant
staircase
,
with
him
in
her
arms
;
his
head
was
lying
on
her
shoulder
,
one
of
his
arms
thrown
negligently
round
her
neck
.
<EOS>
So
they
went
,
toiling
up
;
she
singing
all
the
way
,
and
Paul
sometimes
crooning
out
a
feeble
accompaniment
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
looked
after
them
until
they
reached
the
top
of
the
staircase
---
not
without
halting
to
rest
by
the
way
---
and
passed
out
of
his
sight
;
and
then
he
still
stood
gazing
upwards
,
until
the
dull
rays
of
the
moon
,
glimmering
in
a
melancholy
manner
through
the
dim
skylight
,
sent
him
back
to
his
own
room
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
and
Miss
Tox
were
convoked
in
council
at
dinner
next
day
;
and
when
the
cloth
was
removed
,
Mr
Dombey
opened
the
proceedings
by
requiring
to
be
informed
,
without
any
gloss
or
reservation
,
whether
there
was
anything
the
matter
with
Paul
,
and
what
Mr
Pilkins
said
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
the
child
is
hardly
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
as
stout
as
I
could
wish
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
With
your
usual
happy
discrimination
,
my
dear
Paul
,
"
returned
Mrs
Chick
,
"
you
have
hit
the
point
at
once
.
<EOS>
Our
darling
is
not
altogether
as
stout
as
we
could
wish
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
that
his
mind
is
too
much
for
him
.
<EOS>
His
soul
is
a
great
deal
too
large
for
his
frame
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
the
way
in
which
that
dear
child
talks
!
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
shaking
her
head
;
"
no
one
would
believe
.
<EOS>
His
expressions
,
Lucretia
,
only
yesterday
upon
the
subject
of
Funerals
!
---
"
  
"
I
am
afraid
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
interrupting
her
testily
,
"
that
some
of
those
persons
upstairs
suggest
improper
subjects
to
the
child
.
<EOS>
He
was
speaking
to
me
last
night
about
his
---
about
his
Bones
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
laying
an
irritated
stress
upon
the
word
.
<EOS>
"
What
on
earth
has
anybody
to
do
with
the
---
with
the
---
Bones
of
my
son
?
<EOS>
He
is
not
a
living
skeleton
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
far
from
it
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
with
unspeakable
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
returned
her
brother
.
<EOS>
"
Funerals
again
!
<EOS>
who
talks
to
the
child
of
funerals
?
<EOS>
We
are
not
undertakers
,
or
mutes
,
or
grave
-
diggers
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
far
from
it
,
"
interposed
Mrs
Chick
,
with
the
same
profound
expression
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
who
puts
such
things
into
his
head
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
Really
I
was
quite
dismayed
and
shocked
last
night
.
<EOS>
Who
puts
such
things
into
his
head
,
Louisa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Paul
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
after
a
moment
's
silence
,
"
it
is
of
no
use
inquiring
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
,
I
will
tell
you
candidly
,
that
Wickam
is
a
person
of
very
cheerful
spirit
,
or
what
one
would
call
a
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
daughter
of
Momus
,
"
Miss
Tox
softly
suggested
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Exactly
so
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
;
"
<EOS>
but
she
is
exceedingly
attentive
and
useful
,
and
not
at
all
presumptuous
;
indeed
I
never
saw
a
more
biddable
woman
.
<EOS>
If
the
dear
child
,
"
pursued
Mrs
Chick
,
in
the
tone
of
one
who
was
summing
up
what
had
been
previously
quite
agreed
upon
,
instead
of
saying
it
all
for
the
first
time
,
"
is
a
little
weakened
by
that
last
attack
,
and
is
not
in
quite
such
vigorous
health
as
we
could
wish
;
and
if
he
has
some
temporary
weakness
in
his
system
,
and
does
occasionally
seem
about
to
lose
,
for
the
moment
,
the
use
of
his

"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
was
afraid
to
say
limbs
,
after
Mr
Dombey
's
recent
objection
to
bones
,
and
therefore
waited
for
a
suggestion
from
Miss
Tox
,
who
,
true
to
her
office
,
hazarded
"
members
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Members
!
"
repeated
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
medical
gentleman
mentioned
legs
this
morning
,
my
dear
Louisa
,
did
he
not
?
"
said
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
of
course
he
did
,
my
love
,
"
retorted
Mrs
Chick
,
mildly
reproachful
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
ask
me
?
<EOS>
You
heard
him
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
if
our
dear
Paul
should
lose
,
for
the
moment
,
the
use
of
his
legs
,
these
are
casualties
common
to
many
children
at
his
time
of
life
,
and
not
to
be
prevented
by
any
care
or
caution
.
<EOS>
The
sooner
you
understand
that
,
Paul
,
and
admit
that
,
the
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
you
must
know
,
Louisa
,
"
observed
Mr
Dombey
,
"
that
I
do
n't
question
your
natural
devotion
to
,
and
regard
for
,
the
future
head
of
my
house
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pilkins
saw
Paul
this
morning
,
I
believe
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
did
,
"
returned
his
sister
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
and
myself
were
present
,
Miss
Tox
and
myself
are
always
present
.
<EOS>
We
make
a
point
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pilkins
has
seen
him
for
some
days
past
,
and
a
very
clever
man
I
believe
him
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
says
it
is
nothing
to
speak
of
;
which
I
can
confirm
,
if
that
is
any
consolation
;
but
he
recommended
,
to
-
day
,
sea
-
air
.
<EOS>
Very
wisely
,
Paul
,
I
feel
convinced
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Sea
-
air
,
"
repeated
Mr
Dombey
,
looking
at
his
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
to
be
made
uneasy
by
,
in
that
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
.
<EOS>
"
My
George
and
Frederick
were
both
ordered
sea
-
air
,
when
they
were
about
his
age
;
and
I
have
been
ordered
it
myself
a
great
many
times
.
<EOS>
I
quite
agree
with
you
,
Paul
,
that
perhaps
topics
may
be
incautiously
mentioned
upstairs
before
him
,
which
it
would
be
as
well
for
his
little
mind
not
to
expatiate
upon
;
but
I
really
do
n't
see
how
that
is
to
be
helped
in
the
case
of
a
child
of
his
quickness
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
a
common
child
,
there
would
be
nothing
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
say
I
think
,
with
Miss
Tox
,
that
a
short
absence
from
this
house
,
the
air
of
Brighton
,
and
the
bodily
and
mental
training
of
so
judicious
a
person
as
Mrs
Pipchin
for
instance
---
"
  
"
Who
is
Mrs
Pipchin
,
Louisa
?
"
asked
Mr
Dombey
;
aghast
at
this
familiar
introduction
of
a
name
he
had
never
heard
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Pipchin
,
my
dear
Paul
,
"
returned
his
sister
,
"
is
an
elderly
lady
---
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
knows
her
whole
history
---
who
has
for
some
time
devoted
all
the
energies
of
her
mind
,
with
the
greatest
success
,
to
the
study
and
treatment
of
infancy
,
and
who
has
been
extremely
well
connected
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
broke
his
heart
in
---
how
did
you
say
her
husband
broke
his
heart
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
I
forget
the
precise
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
In
pumping
water
out
of
the
Peruvian
Mines
,
"
replied
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
being
a
Pumper
himself
,
of
course
,
"
said
Mrs
chick
,
glancing
at
her
brother
;
and
it
really
did
seem
necessary
to
offer
the
explanation
,
for
Miss
Tox
had
spoken
of
him
as
if
he
had
died
at
the
handle
;
"
but
having
invested
money
in
the
speculation
,
which
failed
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
Mrs
Pipchin
's
management
of
children
is
quite
astonishing
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
it
commended
in
private
circles
ever
since
I
was
---
<EOS>
dear
me
---
how
high
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
's
eye
wandered
about
the
bookcase
near
the
bust
of
Mr
Pitt
,
which
was
about
ten
feet
from
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
should
say
of
Mrs
Pipchin
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
observed
Miss
Tox
,
with
an
ingenuous
blush
,
"
having
been
so
pointedly
referred
to
,
that
the
encomium
which
has
been
passed
upon
her
by
your
sweet
sister
is
well
merited
.
<EOS>
Many
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
now
grown
up
to
be
interesting
members
of
society
,
have
been
indebted
to
her
care
.
<EOS>
The
humble
individual
who
addresses
you
was
once
under
her
charge
.
<EOS>
I
believe
Juvenile
nobility
itself
is
no
stranger
to
her
establishment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
understand
that
this
respectable
matron
keeps
an
establishment
,
Miss
Tox
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Dombey
,
condescendingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
really
do
n't
know
,
"
rejoined
that
lady
,
"
whether
I
am
justified
in
calling
it
so
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
a
Preparatory
School
by
any
means
.
<EOS>
Should
I
express
my
meaning
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
with
peculiar
sweetness
,
"
if
I
designated
it
<EOS>
an
infantine
Boarding
-
House
of
a
very
select
description
?

On
an
exceedingly
limited
and
particular
scale
,
"
suggested
Mrs
Chick
,
with
a
glance
at
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
Exclusion
itself
!
"
said
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
this
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
's
husband
having
broken
his
heart
of
the
Peruvian
mines
was
good
.
<EOS>
It
had
a
rich
sound
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
Mr
Dombey
was
in
a
state
almost
amounting
to
consternation
at
the
idea
of
Paul
remaining
<EOS>
where
he
was
one
hour
after
his
removal
had
been
recommended
by
the
medical
practitioner
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
stoppage
and
delay
upon
the
road
the
child
must
traverse
,
slowly
at
the
best
,
before
the
goal
was
reached
.
<EOS>
Their
recommendation
of
Mrs
Pipchin
had
great
weight
with
him
;
for
he
knew
that
they
were
jealous
of
any
interference
with
their
charge
,
and
he
never
for
a
moment
took
it
into
account
that
they
might
be
solicitous
to
divide
a
responsibility
,
of
which
he
had
,
as
shown
just
now
,
his
own
established
views
.
<EOS>
Broke
his
heart
of
the
Peruvian
mines
,
mused
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
Well
,
a
very
respectable
way
of
doing
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Supposing
we
should
decide
,
on
to
-
morrow
's
inquiries
,
to
send
Paul
down
to
Brighton
to
this
lady
,
who
would
go
with
him
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Dombey
,
after
some
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
you
could
send
the
child
anywhere
at
present
without
Florence
,
my
dear
Paul
,
"
returned
his
sister
,
hesitating
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
an
infatuation
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
's
very
young
,
you
know
,
and
has
his
fancies
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
turned
his
head
away
,
and
going
slowly
to
the
bookcase
,
and
unlocking
it
,
brought
back
a
book
to
read
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anybody
else
,
Louisa
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
without
looking
up
,
and
turning
over
the
leaves
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wickam
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
Wickam
would
be
quite
sufficient
,
I
should
say
,
"
returned
his
sister
.
<EOS>
"
Paul
being
in
such
hands
as
Mrs
Pipchin
's
,
you
could
hardly
send
anybody
who
would
be
a
further
check
upon
her
.
<EOS>
You
would
go
down
yourself
once
a
-
week
at
least
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
;
and
sat
looking
at
one
page
for
an
hour
afterwards
,
without
reading
one
word
.
  
<EOS>
This
celebrated
Mrs
Pipchin
was
a
marvellous
ill
-
favoured
,
ill
-
conditioned
old
lady
,
of
a
stooping
figure
,
with
a
mottled
face
,
like
bad
marble
,
a
hook
nose
,
and
a
hard
grey
eye
,
that
looked
as
if
it
might
have
been
hammered
at
on
an
anvil
without
sustaining
any
injury
.
<EOS>
Forty
years
at
least
had
elapsed
since
the
Peruvian
mines
had
been
the
death
of
Mr
Pipchin
;
but
his
relict
still
wore
black
bombazeen
,
of
such
a
lustreless
,
deep
,
dead
,
sombre
shade
,
that
gas
itself
could
n't
light
her
up
after
dark
,
and
her
presence
was
a
quencher
to
any
number
of
candles
.
<EOS>
She
was
generally
spoken
of
as
"
a
great
manager
"
of
children
;
and
the
secret
of
her
management
was
,
to
give
them
everything
that
they
did
n't
like
,
and
nothing
that
they
did
---
which
was
found
to
sweeten
their
dispositions
very
much
.
<EOS>
She
was
such
a
bitter
old
lady
,
that
one
was
tempted
to
believe
there
had
been
some
mistake
in
the
application
of
the
Peruvian
machinery
,
and
that
all
her
waters
of
gladness
and
milk
of
human
kindness
,
had
been
pumped
out
dry
,
instead
of
the
mines
.
  
<EOS>
The
Castle
of
this
ogress
and
child
-
queller
was
in
a
steep
by
-
street
at
righton
;
where
the
soil
was
more
than
usually
chalky
,
flinty
,
and
sterile
,
and
the
houses
were
more
than
usually
brittle
and
thin
;
where
the
small
frontgardens
had
the
unaccountable
property
of
producing
nothing
but
marigolds
,
whatever
was
sown
in
them
;
and
where
snails
were
constantly
discovered
holding
on
to
the
street
doors
,
and
other
public
places
they
were
not
expected
to
ornament
,
with
the
tenacity
of
cupping
-
glasses
.
<EOS>
In
the
winter
time
the
air
could
n't
be
got
out
of
the
Castle
,
and
in
the
summer
time
it
could
n't
be
got
in
.
<EOS>
There
was
such
a
continual
reverberation
of
wind
in
it
,
that
it
sounded
like
a
great
shell
,
which
the
inhabitants
were
obliged
to
hold
to
their
ears
night
and
day
,
whether
they
liked
it
or
no
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
,
naturally
,
a
freshsmelling
house
;
and
in
the
window
of
the
front
parlour
,
which
was
never
opened
,
Mrs
Pipchin
kept
a
collection
of
plants
in
pots
,
which
imparted
an
earthy
flavour
of
their
own
to
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
However
choice
examples
of
their
kind
,
too
,
these
plants
were
of
a
kind
peculiarly
adapted
to
the
embowerment
of
Mrs
Pipchin
.
<EOS>
There
were
half
-
a
-
dozen
specimens
of
the
cactus
,
writhing
round
bits
of
lath
,
like
hairy
serpents
;
another
specimen
shooting
out
broad
claws
,
like
a
green
lobster
;
several
creeping
vegetables
,
possessed
of
sticky
and
adhesive
leaves
;
and
one
uncomfortable
flower
-
pot
hanging
to
the
ceiling
,
which
appeared
to
have
boiled
over
,
and
tickling
people
underneath
with
its
long
green
ends
,
reminded
them
of
spiders
---
in
which
Mrs
Pipchin
's
dwelling
was
uncommonly
prolific
,
though
perhaps
it
challenged
competition
still
more
proudly
,
in
the
season
,
in
point
of
earwigs
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
's
scale
of
charges
being
high
,
however
,
to
all
who
could
afford
to
pay
,
and
Mrs
Pipchin
very
seldom
sweetening
the
equable
acidity
of
her
nature
in
favour
of
anybody
,
she
was
held
to
be
an
old
lady
of
remarkable
firmness
,
who
was
quite
scientific
in
her
knowledge
of
the
childish
character
.
<EOS>
On
this
reputation
,
and
on
the
broken
heart
of
Mr
Pipchin
,
she
had
contrived
,
taking
one
year
with
another
,
to
eke
out
a
tolerable
sufficient
living
since
her
husband
's
demise
.
<EOS>
Within
three
days
after
Mrs
Chick
's
first
allusion
to
her
,
this
excellent
old
lady
had
the
satisfaction
of
anticipating
a
handsome
addition
to
her
current
receipts
,
from
the
pocket
of
Mr
Dombey
;
and
of
receiving
Florence
and
her
little
brother
Paul
,
as
inmates
of
the
Castle
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
and
Miss
Tox
,
who
had
brought
them
down
on
the
previous
night
(
which
they
all
passed
at
an
Hotel
)
,
had
just
driven
away
from
the
door
,
on
their
journey
home
again
;
and
Mrs
Pipchin
,
with
her
back
to
the
fire
,
stood
,
reviewing
the
new
-
comers
,
like
an
old
soldier
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
's
middle
-
aged
niece
,
her
good
-
natured
and
devoted
slave
,
but
possessing
a
gaunt
and
ironbound
aspect
,
and
much
afflicted
with
boils
on
her
nose
,
was
divesting
Master
Bitherstone
of
the
clean
collar
he
had
worn
on
parade
.
<EOS>
Miss
Pankey
,
the
only
other
little
boarder
at
present
,
had
that
moment
been
walked
off
to
the
Castle
Dungeon
(
an
empty
apartment
at
the
back
,
devoted
to
correctional
purposes
)
,
for
having
sniffed
thrice
,
in
the
presence
of
visitors
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Pipchin
to
Paul
,
"
how
do
you
think
you
shall
like
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
like
you
at
all
,
"
replied
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
This
is
n't
my
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
It
's
mine
,
"
retorted
Mrs
Pipchin
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
very
nasty
one
,
"
said
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
worse
place
in
it
than
this
though
,
"
said
Mrs
Pipchin
,
"
where
we
shut
up
our
bad
boys
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
he
ever
been
in
it
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Paul
:
pointing
out
Master
Bitherstone
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
nodded
assent
;
and
Paul
had
enough
to
do
,
for
the
rest
of
that
day
,
in
surveying
Master
Bitherstone
from
head
to
foot
,
and
watching
all
the
workings
of
his
countenance
,
with
the
interest
attaching
to
a
boy
of
mysterious
and
terrible
experiences
.
  
<EOS>
At
one
o'clock
there
was
a
dinner
,
chiefly
of
the
farinaceous
and
vegetable
kind
,
when
Miss
Pankey
(
a
mild
little
blue
-
eyed
morsel
of
a
child
,
who
was
shampoo'd
<EOS>
every
morning
,
and
seemed
in
danger
of
being
rubbed
away
,
altogether
)
was
led
in
from
captivity
by
the
ogress
herself
,
and
instructed
that
nobody
who
sniffed
before
visitors
ever
went
to
Heaven
.
<EOS>
When
this
great
truth
had
been
thoroughly
impressed
upon
her
,
she
was
regaled
with
rice
;
and
subsequently
repeated
the
form
of
grace
established
in
the
Castle
,
in
which
there
was
a
special
clause
,
thanking
Mrs
Pipchin
for
a
good
dinner
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
's
niece
,
Berinthia
,
took
cold
pork
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
,
whose
constitution
required
warm
nourishment
,
made
a
special
repast
of
mutton
-
chops
,
which
were
brought
in
hot
and
hot
,
between
two
plates
,
and
smelt
very
nice
.
  
<EOS>
As
it
rained
after
dinner
,
and
they
could
n't
go
out
walking
on
the
beach
,
and
Mrs
Pipchin
's
constitution
required
rest
after
chops
,
they
went
away
with
Berry
(
otherwise
Berinthia
)
to
the
Dungeon
;
an
empty
room
looking
out
upon
a
chalk
wall
and
a
water
-
butt
,
and
made
ghastly
by
a
ragged
fireplace
without
any
stove
in
it
.
<EOS>
Enlivened
by
company
,
however
,
this
was
the
best
place
after
all
;
for
Berry
played
with
them
there
,
and
seemed
to
enjoy
a
game
at
romps
as
much
as
they
did
;
until
Mrs
Pipchin
knocking
angrily
at
the
wall
,
like
the
Cock
Lane
Ghost
revived
,
they
left
off
,
and
Berry
told
them
stories
in
a
whisper
until
twilight
.
  
<EOS>
For
tea
there
was
plenty
of
milk
and
water
,
and
bread
and
butter
,
with
a
little
black
tea
-
pot
for
Mrs
Pipchin
and
Berry
,
and
buttered
toast
unlimited
for
Mrs
Pipchin
,
which
was
brought
in
,
hot
and
hot
,
like
the
chops
.
<EOS>
Though
Mrs
Pipchin
got
very
greasy
,
outside
,
over
this
dish
,
it
did
n't
seem
to
lubricate
her
internally
,
at
all
;
for
she
was
as
fierce
as
ever
,
and
the
hard
grey
eye
knew
no
softening
.
  
<EOS>
After
tea
,
Berry
brought
out
a
little
work
-
box
,
with
the
Royal
Pavilion
on
the
lid
,
and
fell
to
working
busily
;
while
Mrs
Pipchin
,
having
put
on
her
spectacles
and
opened
a
great
volume
bound
in
green
baize
,
began
to
nod
.
<EOS>
And
whenever
Mrs
Pipchin
caught
herself
falling
forward
into
the
fire
,
and
woke
up
,
she
filliped
Master
Bitherstone
on
the
nose
for
nodding
too
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
it
was
the
children
's
bedtime
,
and
after
prayers
they
went
to
bed
.
<EOS>
As
little
Miss
Pankey
was
afraid
of
sleeping
alone
in
the
dark
,
Mrs
Pipchin
always
made
a
point
of
driving
her
up
stairs
herself
,
like
a
sheep
;
and
it
was
cheerful
to
hear
Miss
Pankey
moaning
long
afterwards
,
in
the
least
eligible
chamber
,
and
Mrs
Pipchin
now
and
then
going
in
to
shake
her
.
<EOS>
At
about
halfpast
nine
o'clock
the
odour
of
a
warm
sweet
-
bread
(
Mrs
Pipchin
's
constitution
would
n't
go
to
sleep
without
sweet
-
bread
)
<EOS>
diversified
the
prevailing
fragrance
of
the
house
,
which
Mrs
Wickam
said
was
"
a
smell
of
building
;
"
and
slumber
fell
upon
the
Castle
shortly
after
.
  
<EOS>
The
breakfast
next
morning
was
like
the
tea
over
night
,
except
that
Mrs
Pipchin
took
her
roll
instead
of
toast
,
and
seemed
a
little
more
irate
when
it
was
over
.
<EOS>
Master
Bitherstone
read
aloud
to
the
rest
a
pedigree
from
Genesis
(
judi
-
ciously
selected
by
Mrs
Pipchin
)
,
getting
over
the
names
with
the
ease
and
clearness
of
a
person
tumbling
up
the
treadmill
.
<EOS>
That
done
,
Miss
Pankey
was
borne
away
to
be
shampoo'd
;
and
Master
Bitherstone
to
have
something
else
done
to
him
with
salt
water
,
from
which
he
always
returned
very
blue
and
dejected
.
<EOS>
Paul
and
Florence
went
out
in
the
meantime
on
the
beach
with
Wickam
---
who
was
constantly
in
tears
---
and
at
about
noon
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
presided
over
some
Early
Readings
.
<EOS>
It
being
a
part
of
Mrs
Pipchin
's
system
not
to
encourage
a
child
's
mind
to
develop
and
expand
itself
like
a
young
flower
,
but
to
open
it
by
force
like
an
oyster
,
the
moral
of
these
lessons
was
usually
of
a
violent
and
stunning
character
:
the
hero
---
a
naughty
boy
---
seldom
,
in
the
mildest
catastrophe
,
being
finished
off
by
anything
less
than
a
lion
,
or
a
bear
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
life
at
Mrs
Pipchin
's
.
<EOS>
On
Saturday
Mr
Dombey
came
down
;
and
Florence
and
Paul
would
go
to
his
Hotel
,
and
have
tea
.
<EOS>
They
passed
the
whole
of
Sunday
with
him
,
and
generally
rode
out
before
dinner
;
and
on
these
occasions
Mr
Dombey
seemed
to
grow
,
like
Falstaff
's
assailants
,
and
instead
of
being
one
man
in
buckram
,
to
become
a
dozen
.
<EOS>
Sunday
evening
was
the
most
melancholy
evening
in
the
week
;
for
Mrs
Pipchin
always
made
a
point
of
being
particularly
cross
on
Sunday
nights
.
<EOS>
Miss
Pankey
was
generally
brought
back
from
an
aunt
's
at
Rottingdean
,
in
deep
distress
;
and
Master
Bitherstone
,
whose
relatives
were
all
in
India
,
and
who
was
required
to
sit
,
between
the
services
,
in
an
erect
position
with
his
head
against
the
parlour
wall
,
neither
moving
hand
nor
foot
,
suffered
so
acutely
in
his
young
spirits
that
he
once
asked
Florence
,
on
a
Sunday
night
,
if
she
could
give
him
any
idea
of
the
way
back
to
Bengal
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
generally
said
that
Mrs
Pipchin
was
a
woman
of
system
with
children
;
and
no
doubt
she
was
.
<EOS>
Certainly
the
wild
ones
went
home
tame
enough
,
after
sojourning
for
a
few
months
beneath
her
hospitable
roof
.
<EOS>
It
was
generally
said
,
too
,
that
it
was
highly
creditable
of
Mrs
Pipchin
to
have
devoted
herself
to
this
way
of
life
,
and
to
have
made
such
a
sacrifice
of
her
feelings
,
and
such
a
resolute
stand
against
her
troubles
,
when
Mr
Pipchin
broke
his
heart
in
the
Peruvian
mines
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
exemplary
old
lady
,
Paul
would
sit
staring
in
his
little
arm
-
chair
by
the
fire
,
for
any
length
of
time
.
<EOS>
He
never
seemed
to
know
what
weariness
was
,
when
he
was
looking
fixedly
at
Mrs
Pipchin
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
fond
of
her
;
he
was
not
afraid
of
her
;
but
in
those
old
,
old
moods
of
his
,
she
seemed
to
have
a
grotesque
attraction
for
him
.
<EOS>
There
he
would
sit
,
looking
at
her
,
and
warming
his
hands
,
and
looking
at
her
,
until
he
sometimes
quite
confounded
Mrs
Pipchin
,
Ogress
as
she
was
.
<EOS>
Once
she
asked
him
,
when
they
were
alone
,
what
he
was
thinking
about
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
"
said
Paul
,
without
the
least
reserve
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
are
you
thinking
about
me
?
"
asked
Mrs
Pipchin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
thinking
how
old
you
must
be
,
"
said
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
n't
say
such
things
as
that
,
young
gentleman
,
"
returned
the
dame
.
<EOS>
"
That
'll
never
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
asked
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
it
's
not
polite
,
"
said
Mrs
Pipchin
,
snappishly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
polite
?
"
said
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
polite
,
"
said
Paul
,
innocently
,
"
to
eat
all
the
mutton
-
chops
and
toast
,
Wickam
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Wickam
,
"
retorted
Mrs
Pipchin
,
colouring
,
"
is
a
wicked
,
impudent
,
boldfaced
hussy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
you
mind
,
Sir
,
"
retorted
Mrs
Pipchin
.
"
<EOS>
Remember
the
story
of
the
little
boy
that
was
gored
to
death
by
a
mad
bull
for
asking
questions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
the
bull
was
mad
,
"
said
Paul
,
"
how
did
he
know
that
the
boy
had
asked
questions
?
<EOS>
Nobody
can
go
and
whisper
secrets
to
a
mad
bull
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
that
story
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
believe
it
,
Sir
?
"
repeated
Mrs
Pipchin
,
amazed
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
if
it
should
happen
to
have
been
a
tame
bull
,
you
little
Infidel
?
"
said
Mrs
Pipchen
.
  
<EOS>
As
Paul
had
not
considered
the
subject
in
that
light
,
and
had
founded
his
conclusions
on
the
alleged
lunacy
of
the
bull
,
he
allowed
himself
to
be
put
down
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
But
he
sat
turning
it
over
in
his
mind
,
with
such
an
obvious
intention
of
fixing
Mrs
Pipchin
presently
,
that
even
that
hardy
old
lady
deemed
it
prudent
to
retreat
until
he
should
have
forgotten
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
From
that
time
,
Mrs
Pipchin
appeared
to
have
something
of
the
same
odd
kind
of
attraction
towards
Paul
,
as
Paul
had
towards
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
make
him
move
his
chair
to
her
side
of
the
fire
,
instead
of
sitting
opposite
;
and
there
he
would
remain
in
a
nook
between
Mrs
Pipchin
and
the
fender
,
with
all
the
light
of
his
little
face
absorbed
into
the
black
bombazeen
drapery
,
studying
every
line
and
wrinkle
of
her
countenance
,
and
peering
at
the
hard
grey
eye
,
until
Mrs
Pipchin
was
sometimes
fain
to
shut
it
on
pretence
of
dozing
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
had
an
old
black
cat
,
who
generally
lay
coiled
upon
the
centre
foot
of
the
fender
,
purring
egotistically
,
and
winking
at
the
fire
until
the
contracted
pupils
of
his
eyes
were
like
two
notes
of
admiration
.
<EOS>
The
good
old
lady
might
have
been
---
not
to
record
it
disrespectfully
---
a
witch
,
and
Paul
and
the
cat
her
two
familiars
,
as
they
all
sat
by
the
fire
together
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
quite
in
keeping
with
the
appearance
of
the
party
if
they
had
all
sprung
up
the
chimney
in
a
high
wind
one
night
,
and
never
been
heard
of
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
never
came
to
pass
.
<EOS>
The
cat
,
and
Paul
,
and
Mrs
Pipchin
,
were
constantly
to
be
found
in
their
usual
places
after
dark
;
and
Paul
,
eschewing
the
companionship
of
Master
Bitherstone
,
went
on
studying
Mrs
Pipchin
,
and
the
cat
,
and
the
fire
,
night
after
night
,
as
if
they
were
a
book
of
necromancy
,
in
three
volumes
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Wickam
put
her
own
construction
on
Paul
's
eccentricities
:
and
being
confirmed
in
her
low
spirits
by
a
perplexed
view
of
chimneys
from
the
room
where
she
was
accustomed
to
sit
,
and
by
the
noise
of
the
wind
,
and
by
the
general
dulness
(
gashliness
was
Mrs
Wickam
's
strong
expression
)
of
her
present
life
,
deduced
the
most
dismal
reflections
from
the
foregoing
premises
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
part
of
Mrs
Pipchin
's
policy
to
prevent
her
own
"
young
hussy
"
---
that
was
Mrs
Pipchin
's
generic
name
for
female
servant
---
from
communicating
with
Mrs
Wickam
:
to
which
end
she
devoted
much
of
her
time
to
concealing
herself
behind
doors
,
and
springing
out
on
that
devoted
maiden
,
whenever
she
made
an
approach
towards
Mrs
Wickam
's
apartment
.
<EOS>
But
Berry
was
free
to
hold
what
converse
she
could
in
that
quarter
consistently
with
the
discharge
of
the
multifarious
duties
at
which
she
toiled
incessantly
from
morning
to
night
;
and
to
Berry
Mrs
Wickam
unburdened
her
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
pretty
fellow
he
is
when
he
's
asleep
!
"
<EOS>
said
Berry
,
stopping
to
look
at
Paul
in
bed
,
one
night
when
she
took
up
Mrs
Wickam
's
supper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
sighed
Mrs
Wickam
.
<EOS>
"
He
need
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
he
's
not
ugly
when
he
's
awake
,
"
observed
Berry
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Ma'am
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
.
<EOS>
No
more
was
my
uncle
's
Betsey
Jane
,
"
said
Mrs
Wickam
.
  
<EOS>
Berry
looked
as
if
she
would
like
to
trace
the
connexion
of
ideas
between
Paul
Dombey
and
Mrs
Wickam
's
Uncle
's
Betsey
Jane
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
's
wife
,
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Wickam
went
on
to
say
,
"
died
just
like
his
mama
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
's
child
took
on
just
as
Master
Paul
do
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
's
child
made
people
's
blood
run
cold
,
sometimes
,
she
did
!
"
  
<EOS>
R"How
!
"
<EOS>
asked
Berry
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
have
sat
up
all
night
alone
with
Betsey
Jane
!
"
said
Mrs
Wickam
,
"
not
if
you
'd
have
put
Wickam
into
business
next
morning
for
himself
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
have
done
it
,
Miss
Berry
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Berry
naturally
asked
why
not
?
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Wickam
,
agreeably
to
the
usage
of
some
ladies
in
her
condition
,
pursued
her
own
branch
of
the
subject
without
any
compunction
.
  
<EOS>
"
Betsey
Jane
,
"
said
Mrs
Wickam
,
"
was
as
sweet
a
child
as
I
could
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
wish
to
see
a
sweeter
.
<EOS>
Everything
that
a
child
could
have
in
the
way
of
illnesses
,
Betsey
Jane
had
come
through
.
<EOS>
The
cramps
was
as
common
to
her
,
"
said
Mrs
Wickam
,
"
as
biles
is
to
yourself
,
Miss
Berry
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Miss
Berry
involuntarily
wrinkled
her
nose
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
Betsey
Jane
,
"
said
Mrs
Wickam
,
lowering
her
voice
,
and
looking
round
the
room
,
and
towards
Paul
in
bed
,
"
had
been
minded
,
in
her
cradle
,
by
her
departed
mother
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
say
how
,
nor
I
could
n't
say
when
,
nor
I
could
n't
say
whether
the
dear
child
knew
it
or
not
,
but
Betsey
Jane
had
been
watched
by
her
mother
,
Miss
Berry
!
<EOS>
You
may
say
nonsense
!
<EOS>
I
an't
offended
,
Miss.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
may
be
able
to
think
in
your
own
conscience
that
it
is
nonsense
;
you
'll
find
your
spirits
all
the
better
for
it
in
this
<EOS>
---
you
'll
excuse
my
being
so
free
---
in
this
burying
-
ground
of
a
place
;
which
is
wearing
of
me
down
.
<EOS>
Master
Paul
's
a
little
restless
in
his
sleep
.
<EOS>
Pat
his
back
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
think
,
"
said
Berry
,
gently
doing
what
she
was
asked
,
"
that
he
has
been
nursed
by
his
mother
,
too
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Betsey
Jane
,
"
returned
Mrs
Wickam
in
her
most
solemn
tones
,
"
was
put
upon
as
that
child
has
been
put
upon
,
and
changed
as
that
child
has
changed
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
her
sit
,
often
and
often
,
think
,
think
,
thinking
,
like
him

<EOS>
I
have
seen
her
look
,
often
and
often
,
old

old
,
old
,
like
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
her
,
many
a
time
,
talk
just
like
him
.
<EOS>
I
consider
that
child
and
Betsey
Jane
on
the
same
footing
entirely
,
Miss
Berry
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Is
your
uncle
's
child
alive
?
"
asked
Berry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Miss
,
she
is
alive
,
"
returned
Mrs
Wickam
with
an
air
of
triumph
,
for
it
was
evident
Miss
Berry
expected
the
reverse
;
"
and
is
married
to
a
silverchaser
.
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
Miss
,
SHE
is
alive
,
"
said
Mrs
Wickam
,
laying
strong
stress
on
her
nominative
case
.
  
<EOS>
It
being
clear
that
somebody
was
dead
,
Mrs
Pipchin
's
niece
inquired
who
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
wish
to
make
you
uneasy
,
"
returned
Mrs
Wickam
,
pursuing
her
supper
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
ask
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
surest
way
of
being
asked
again
.
<EOS>
Miss
Berry
repeated
her
question
,
therefore
;
and
after
some
resistance
,
and
reluctance
,
Mrs
Wickam
laid
down
her
knife
,
and
again
glancing
round
the
room
and
at
Paul
in
bed
,
replied
:
  
"
<EOS>
She
took
fancies
to
people
;
whimsical
fancies
,
some
of
them
;
others
,
affections
that
one
might
expect
to
see
---
only
stronger
than
common
.
<EOS>
They
all
died
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
so
very
unexpected
and
awful
to
Mrs
Pipchin
's
niece
,
that
she
sat
upright
on
the
hard
edge
of
the
bedstead
,
breathing
short
,
and
surveying
her
informant
with
looks
of
undisguised
alarm
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Wickam
shook
her
left
fore
-
finger
stealthily
towards
the
bed
where
Florence
lay
;
then
turned
it
upside
down
,
and
made
several
emphatic
points
at
the
floor
;
immediately
below
which
was
the
parlour
in
which
Mrs
Pipchin
habitually
consumed
the
toast
.
  
<EOS>
"
Remember
my
words
,
Miss
Berry
,
"
said
Mrs
Wickam
,
"
and
be
thankful
that
Master
Paul
is
not
too
fond
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
,
that
he
's
not
too
fond
of
me
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
;
though
there
is
n't
much
to
live
for
---
you
'll
excuse
my
being
so
free
---
in
this
jail
of
a
house
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Berry
's
emotion
might
have
led
to
her
patting
Paul
too
hard
on
the
back
,
or
might
have
produced
a
cessation
of
that
soothing
monotony
,
but
he
turned
in
his
bed
just
now
,
and
,
presently
awaking
,
sat
up
in
it
with
his
hair
hot
and
wet
from
the
effects
of
some
childish
dream
,
and
asked
for
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
out
of
her
own
bed
at
the
first
sound
of
his
voice
;
and
bending
over
his
pillow
immediately
,
sang
him
to
sleep
again
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Wickam
shaking
her
head
,
and
letting
fall
several
tears
,
pointed
out
the
little
group
to
Berry
,
and
turned
her
eyes
up
to
the
ceiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
Miss
!
"
said
Wickam
,
softly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
Your
aunt
is
an
old
lady
,
Miss
Berry
,
and
it
's
what
you
must
have
looked
for
,
often
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
consolatory
farewell
,
Mrs
Wickam
accompanied
with
a
look
of
heartfelt
anguish
;
and
being
left
alone
with
the
two
children
again
,
and
becoming
conscious
that
the
wind
was
blowing
mournfully
<EOS>
,
she
indulged
in
melancholy
---
that
cheapest
and
most
accessible
of
luxuries
---
until
she
was
overpowered
by
slumber
.
  
<EOS>
Although
the
niece
of
Mrs
Pipchin
did
not
expect
to
find
that
exemplary
dragon
prostrate
on
the
hearth
-
rug
when
she
went
down
stairs
,
she
was
relieved
to
find
her
unusually
fractious
and
severe
,
and
with
every
present
appearance
of
intending
to
live
a
long
time
to
be
a
comfort
to
all
who
knew
her
.
<EOS>
Nor
had
she
any
symptoms
of
declining
,
in
the
course
of
the
ensuing
week
,
when
the
constitutional
viands
still
continued
to
disappear
in
regular
succession
,
notwithstanding
that
Paul
studied
her
as
attentively
as
ever
,
and
occupied
his
usual
seat
between
the
black
skirts
and
the
fender
,
with
unwavering
constancy
.
  
<EOS>
But
as
Paul
himself
was
no
stronger
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
than
he
had
been
on
his
first
arrival
,
though
he
looked
much
healthier
in
the
face
,
a
little
carriage
was
got
for
him
,
in
which
he
could
lie
at
his
ease
,
with
an
alphabet
and
other
elementary
works
of
reference
,
and
be
wheeled
down
to
the
sea
-
side
.
<EOS>
Consistent
in
his
odd
tastes
,
the
child
set
aside
a
ruddy
-
faced
lad
who
was
proposed
as
the
drawer
of
this
carriage
,
and
selected
,
instead
,
his
grandfather
---
a
weazen
,
old
,
crab
-
faced
man
,
in
a
suit
of
battered
oilskin
,
who
had
got
tough
and
stringy
from
long
pickling
in
salt
water
,
and
who
smelt
like
a
weedy
sea
-
beach
when
the
tide
is
out
.
  
<EOS>
With
this
notable
attendant
to
pull
him
along
,
and
Florence
always
walking
by
his
side
,
and
the
despondent
Wickam
bringing
up
the
rear
,
he
went
down
to
the
margin
of
the
ocean
every
day
;
and
there
he
would
sit
or
lie
in
his
carriage
for
hours
together
:
never
so
distressed
as
by
the
company
of
children
---
Florence
alone
excepted
,
always
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
away
,
if
you
please
,
"
he
would
say
to
any
child
who
came
to
bear
him
company
.
"
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
but
I
do
n't
want
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Some
small
voice
,
near
his
ear
,
would
ask
him
how
he
was
,
perhaps
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
well
<EOS>
,
I
thank
you
,
"
he
would
answer
.
"
<EOS>
But
you
had
better
go
and
play
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
he
would
turn
his
head
,
and
watch
the
child
away
,
and
say
to
Florence
,
"
We
do
n't
want
any
others
,
do
we
?
<EOS>
Kiss
me
,
Floy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
even
a
dislike
,
at
such
times
,
to
the
company
of
Wickam
,
and
was
well
pleased
when
she
strolled
away
,
as
she
generally
did
,
to
pick
up
shells
and
acquaintances
.
<EOS>
His
favourite
spot
was
quite
a
lonely
one
,
far
away
from
most
loungers
;
and
with
Florence
sitting
by
his
side
at
work
,
or
reading
to
him
,
or
talking
to
him
,
and
the
wind
blowing
on
his
face
,
and
the
water
coming
up
among
the
wheels
of
his
bed
,
he
wanted
nothing
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
Floy
,
"
he
said
one
day
,
"
where
's
India
,
where
that
boy
's
friends
live
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
a
long
,
long
distance
off
,
"
said
Florence
,
raising
her
eyes
from
her
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
Weeks
off
?
"
asked
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dear
.
<EOS>
Many
weeks
'
journey
,
night
and
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
in
India
,
Floy
,
"
said
Paul
,
after
being
silent
for
a
minute
,
"
I
should
---
what
is
that
Mama
did
?
<EOS>
I
forget
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Loved
me
!
"
<EOS>
answered
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
I
love
you
now
,
Floy
?
<EOS>
What
is
it
?
<EOS>
---
Died
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
in
India
,
I
should
die
,
Floy
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
hurriedly
put
her
work
aside
,
and
laid
her
head
down
on
his
pillow
,
caressing
him
.
<EOS>
And
so
would
she
,
she
said
,
if
he
were
there
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
better
soon
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
am
a
great
deal
better
now
!
"
<EOS>
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
that
.
<EOS>
I
mean
that
I
should
die
of
being
so
sorry
and
so
lonely
,
Floy
!
"
  
<EOS>
Another
time
,
in
the
same
place
,
he
fell
asleep
,
and
slept
quietly
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
Awaking
suddenly
,
he
listened
,
started
up
,
and
sat
listening
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
asked
him
what
he
thought
he
heard
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
know
what
it
says
,
"
he
answered
,
looking
steadily
in
her
face
.
"
<EOS>
The
sea
,
Floy
<EOS>
,
what
is
it
that
it
keeps
on
saying
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
told
him
that
it
was
only
the
noise
of
the
rolling
waves
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
know
that
they
are
always
saying
something
.
<EOS>
Always
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
What
place
is
over
there
?
"
<EOS>
He
rose
up
,
looking
eagerly
at
the
horizon
.
  
<EOS>
She
told
him
that
there
was
another
country
opposite
,
but
he
said
he
did
n't
mean
that
:
he
meant
farther
away
---
farther
away
!
  
<EOS>
Very
often
afterwards
,
in
the
midst
of
their
talk
,
he
would
break
off
,
to
try
to
understand
what
it
was
that
the
waves
were
always
saying
;
and
would
rise
up
in
his
couch
to
look
towards
that
invisible
region
,
far
away
.
    
Chapter
9
.
<EOS>
In
which
the
Wooden
Midshipman
gets
into
Trouble
 
THAT
spice
of
romance
and
love
of
the
marvellous
,
of
which
there
was
a
pretty
strong
infusion
in
the
nature
of
young
Walter
Gay
,
and
which
the
guardianship
of
his
uncle
,
old
Solomon
Gills
,
had
not
very
much
weakened
by
the
waters
of
stern
practical
experience
,
was
the
occasion
of
his
attaching
an
uncommon
and
delightful
interest
to
the
adventure
of
Florence
with
good
Mrs
Brown
.
<EOS>
He
pampered
and
cherished
it
in
his
memory
,
especially
that
part
of
it
with
which
he
had
been
associated
:
until
it
became
the
spoiled
child
of
his
fancy
,
and
took
its
own
way
,
and
did
what
it
liked
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
recollection
of
those
incidents
,
and
his
own
share
in
them
,
may
have
been
made
the
more
captivating
,
perhaps
,
by
the
weekly
dreamings
of
old
Sol
and
Captain
Cuttle
on
Sundays
.
<EOS>
Hardly
a
Sunday
passed
,
without
mysterious
references
being
made
by
one
or
other
of
those
worthy
chums
to
Richard
Whittington
;
and
the
latter
gentleman
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
purchase
a
ballad
of
considerable
antiquity
,
that
had
long
fluttered
among
many
others
,
chiefly
expressive
of
maritime
sentiments
,
on
a
dead
wall
in
the
Commercial
Roads
:
which
poetical
performances
set
forth
the
courtship
and
nuptials
of
a
promising
young
coal
-
whipper
with
a
certain
"
lovely
Peg
,
"
the
accomplished
daughter
of
the
master
and
part
-
owner
of
a
Newcastle
collier
.
<EOS>
In
this
stirring
legend
,
Captain
Cuttle
descried
a
profound
metaphysical
bearing
on
the
case
of
Walter
and
Florence
;
and
it
excited
him
so
much
,
that
on
very
festive
occasions
,
as
birthdays
and
few
other
non
-
Dominical
holidays
,
he
would
roar
through
the
whole
song
in
the
little
back
parlour
;
making
an
amazing
shake
on
the
word
Pe
-
e
-
eg
,
with
which
every
verse
concluded
,
in
compliment
to
the
heroine
of
the
piece
.
  
<EOS>
But
a
frank
,
free
-
spirited
,
open
-
hearted
boy
,
is
not
much
given
to
analysing
the
nature
of
his
own
feelings
,
however
strong
their
hold
upon
him
:
and
<EOS>
Walter
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
decide
this
point
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
great
affection
for
the
wharf
where
he
had
encountered
Florence
,
and
for
the
streets
(
albeit
not
enchanting
in
themselves
)
by
which
they
had
come
home
.
<EOS>
The
shoes
that
had
so
often
tumbled
off
by
way
,
he
preserved
in
his
own
room
;
and
,
sitting
in
the
little
back
parlour
of
an
evening
,
he
had
drawn
a
whole
gallery
of
fancy
portraits
of
good
Mrs
Brown
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
he
became
a
little
smarter
in
his
dress
after
that
memorable
occasion
;
and
he
certainly
liked
in
his
leisure
time
to
walk
towards
that
quarter
of
the
town
where
Mr
Dombey
's
house
was
situated
,
on
the
vague
chance
of
passing
little
Florence
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
But
the
sentiment
of
all
this
was
as
boyish
and
innocent
as
could
be
.
<EOS>
Florence
was
very
pretty
,
and
it
is
pleasant
to
admire
a
pretty
face
.
<EOS>
Florence
was
defenceless
and
weak
,
and
it
was
a
proud
thought
that
he
had
been
able
to
render
her
any
protection
and
assistantce
.
<EOS>
Florence
was
the
most
grateful
little
creature
in
the
world
,
and
it
was
delightful
to
see
her
bright
gratitude
beaming
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
Florence
was
neglected
and
coldly
looked
upon
,
and
his
breast
was
full
of
youthful
interest
for
the
slighted
child
in
her
dull
,
stately
home
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
it
came
about
that
,
perhaps
some
half
-
a
-
dozen
times
in
the
course
of
the
year
,
Walter
pulled
off
his
hat
to
Florence
in
the
street
,
and
Florence
would
stop
to
shake
hands
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Wickam
(
who
,
with
a
characteristic
alteration
of
his
name
,
invariably
spoke
of
him
as
"
Young
Graves
'
)
was
so
well
used
to
this
,
knowing
the
story
of
their
acquaintance
,
that
she
took
no
heed
of
it
at
all
.
<EOS>
Miss
Nipper
,
on
the
other
hand
,
rather
looked
out
for
these
occasions
:
<EOS>
her
sensitive
young
heart
being
secretly
propitiated
by
Walter
's
good
looks
,
and
inclining
to
the
belief
that
its
sentiments
were
responded
to
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
Walter
,
so
far
from
forgetting
or
losing
sight
of
his
acquaintance
with
Florence
,
only
remembered
it
better
and
better
.
<EOS>
As
to
its
adventurous
beginning
,
and
all
those
little
circumstances
which
gave
it
a
distinctive
character
and
relish
,
he
took
them
into
account
,
more
as
a
pleasant
story
very
agreeable
to
his
imagination
,
and
not
to
be
dismissed
from
it
,
than
as
a
part
of
any
matter
of
fact
with
which
he
was
concerned
.
<EOS>
They
set
off
Florence
very
much
,
to
his
fancy
;
but
not
himself
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
thought
(
and
then
he
walked
very
fast
)
<EOS>
what
a
grand
thing
it
would
have
been
for
him
to
have
been
going
to
sea
on
the
day
after
that
first
meeting
,
and
to
have
gone
,
and
to
have
done
wonders
there
,
and
to
have
stopped
away
a
long
time
,
and
to
have
come
back
an
Admiral
of
all
the
colours
of
the
dolphin
,
or
at
least
a
Post
-
Captain
with
epaulettes
of
insupportable
brightness
,
and
have
married
Florence
(
then
a
beautiful
young
woman
)
in
spite
of
Mr
Dombey
's
teeth
,
cravat
,
and
watch
-
chain
,
and
borne
her
away
to
the
blue
shores
of
somewhere
or
other
,
triumphantly
.
<EOS>
But
these
flights
of
fancy
seldom
burnished
the
brass
plate
of
Dombey
and
Son
's
Offices
into
a
tablet
of
golden
hope
,
or
shed
a
brilliant
lustre
on
their
dirty
skylights
;
and
when
the
Captain
and
Uncle
Sol
talked
about
Richard
Whittington
and
masters
'
daughters
,
Walter
felt
that
he
understood
his
true
position
at
Dombey
and
Son
's
much
better
than
they
did
.
  
<EOS>
So
it
was
that
he
went
on
doing
what
he
had
to
do
from
day
to
day
,
in
a
cheerful
,
pains
-
taking
,
merry
spirit
;
and
saw
through
the
sanguine
complexion
of
Uncle
Sol
and
Captain
Cuttle
;
and
yet
entertained
a
thousand
indistinct
and
visionary
fancies
of
his
own
,
to
which
theirs
were
word
-
a
-
day
probabilities
.
<EOS>
Such
was
his
condition
at
the
Pipchin
period
,
when
he
looked
a
little
older
than
of
yore
,
but
not
much
;
and
was
the
same
light
-
footed
,
light
-
hearted
,
lightheaded
lad
,
as
when
he
charged
into
the
parlour
at
the
head
of
Uncle
Sol
and
the
imaginary
boarders
,
and
lighted
him
to
bring
up
the
Madeira
.
  
<EOS>
"
Uncle
Sol
'
,
said
Walter
,
"
I
do
n't
think
you
're
well
.
<EOS>
You
have
n't
eaten
any
breakfast
.
<EOS>
I
shall
bring
a
doctor
to
you
,
if
you
go
on
like
this
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
ca
n't
give
me
what
I
want
,
my
boy
,
"
said
Uncle
Sol
.
<EOS>
"
At
least
he
is
in
good
practice
if
he
can
---
<EOS>
and
then
he
would
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
Uncle
?
<EOS>
Customers
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
"
returned
Solomon
,
with
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
Customers
would
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Confound
it
,
Uncle
!
"
said
Walter
,
putting
down
his
breakfast
cup
with
a
clatter
,
and
striking
his
hand
on
the
table
:
"
<EOS>
when
I
see
the
people
going
up
and
down
the
street
in
shoals
all
day
,
and
passing
and
re
-
passing
the
shop
every
minute
,
by
scores
,
I
feel
half
tempted
to
rush
out
,
collar
somebody
,
bring
him
in
,
and
make
him
buy
fifty
pounds
'
worth
of
instruments
for
ready
money
.
<EOS>
What
are
you
looking
in
at
the
door
for
?
<EOS>
---
"
continued
Walter
,
apostrophizing
an
old
gentleman
with
a
powdered
head
(
inaudibly
to
him
of
course
)
,
who
was
staring
at
a
ship
's
telescope
with
all
his
might
and
main
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
no
use
.
<EOS>
I
could
do
that
.
<EOS>
Come
in
and
buy
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
,
however
,
having
satiated
his
curiosity
,
walked
calmly
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
he
goes
!
"
said
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
way
with'em
all
.
<EOS>
But
,
Uncle
---
I
say
,
uncle
Sol
"
---
for
the
old
man
was
meditating
,
and
had
not
responded
to
his
first
appeal
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
cast
down
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
out
of
spirits
,
Uncle
.
<EOS>
When
orders
do
come
,
they
'll
come
in
such
a
crowd
,
you
wo
n't
be
able
to
execute
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
past
executing
'em
,
whenever
they
come
,
my
boy
,
"
returned
Solomon
Gills
.
<EOS>
"
They
'll
never
come
to
this
shop
again
,
till
I
am
out
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Uncle
!
<EOS>
You
musn't
<EOS>
really
,
you
know
!
urged
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
!
"
  
<EOS>
Old
Sol
endeavoured
to
assume
a
cherry
look
,
and
smiled
across
the
little
table
at
him
as
pleasantly
as
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
more
than
usual
<EOS>
the
matter
<EOS>
;
is
there
,
Uncle
?
"
said
Walter
,
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
tea
tray
and
bending
over
,
to
speak
the
more
confidentially
and
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Be
open
with
me
,
Uncle
,
if
there
is
,
and
tell
me
all
about
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no

"
returned
Old
Sol
.
<EOS>
"
More
than
usual
?
<EOS>
No
,
no
.
<EOS>
what
should
there
be
the
matter
more
than
usual
?
"
   
<EOS>
Walter
answered
with
an
incredulous
shake
of
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
I
want
to
know
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
you
ask
me
!
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
Uncle
,
when
I
see
you
like
this
,
I
am
quite
sorry
that
I
live
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Old
Sol
opened
his
eyes
involuntarily
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Though
nobody
ever
was
happier
than
I
am
and
always
have
been
with
you
,
I
am
quite
sorry
that
I
live
with
you
,
when
I
see
you
with
anything
on
your
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
little
dull
at
such
times
,
I
know
,
"
observed
Solomon
,
meekly
rubbing
his
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
mean
,
Uncle
Sol
,
"
pursued
Walter
,
bending
over
a
little
more
to
pat
him
on
the
shoulder
,
"
is
,
that
then
I
feel
you
ought
to
have
,
sitting
here
and
pouring
out
the
tea
instead
of
me
,
a
nice
little
dumpling
of
a
wife
,
you
know
,
---
a
comfortable
,
capital
,
cosey
old
lady
,
who
was
just
a
match
for
you
,
and
knew
how
to
manage
you
,
and
keep
you
in
good
heart
.
<EOS>
Here
am
I
,
as
loving
a
nephew
as
ever
was
<EOS>
(
I
am
sure
I
ought
to
be
!
)
<EOS>
but
I
am
only
a
nephew
,
and
I
ca
n't
be
such
a
companion
to
you
when
you
're
low
and
out
of
sorts
as
she
would
have
made
herself
,
years
ago
,
though
I
'm
sure
I
'd
give
any
money
if
I
could
cheer
you
up
.
<EOS>
And
so
I
say
,
when
I
see
you
with
anything
on
your
mind
,
that
I
feel
quite
sorry
<EOS>
you
have
n't
got
somebody
better
about
you
than
a
blundering
young
rough
-
and
-
tough
boy
like
me
,
who
has
got
the
will
to
console
you
,
Uncle
,
but
has
n't
got
the
way
---
<EOS>
has
n't
got
the
way
,
"
repeated
Walter
,
reaching
over
further
yet
,
to
shake
his
uncle
by
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wally
,
my
dear
boy
,
"
said
Solomon
,
"
if
the
cosey
little
old
lady
had
taken
her
place
in
this
parlour
five
and
forty
years
ago
,
I
never
could
have
been
fonder
of
her
than
I
am
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
,
Uncle
Sol
,
"
returned
Walter
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
bless
you
,
I
know
that
.
<EOS>
But
you
would
n't
have
had
the
whole
weight
of
any
uncomfortable
secrets
if
she
had
been
with
you
,
because
she
would
have
known
how
to
relieve
you
of'em
,
and
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
you
do
,
"
returned
the
instrument
-
maker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
what
's
the
matter
,
Uncle
Sol
?
"
said
Walter
,
coaxingly
.
<EOS>
"
Come
!
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
Solomon
Gills
persisted
that
there
was
nothing
the
matter
;
and
maintained
it
so
resolutely
,
that
his
nephew
had
no
resource
but
to
make
a
very
indifferent
imitation
of
believing
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
I
can
say
is
,
Uncle
Sol
,
that
if
there
is
"
  
"
But
there
is
n't
"
said
Solomon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
Then
I
've
no
more
to
say
;
and
that
's
lucky
,
for
my
time
's
up
for
going
to
business
.
<EOS>
I
shall
look
in
by
-
and
-
by
when
I
'm
out
,
to
see
how
you
get
on
,
Uncle
.
<EOS>
And
mind
,
Uncle
!
<EOS>
I
'll
never
believe
you
again
,
and
never
tell
you
anything
more
about
Mr
Carker
the
Junior
,
if
I
find
out
that
you
have
been
deceiving
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
Solomon
Gills
laughingly
defied
him
to
find
out
anything
of
the
kind
;
and
Walter
,
revolving
in
his
thoughts
all
sorts
of
impracticable
ways
of
making
fortunes
and
placing
the
wooden
midshipman
in
a
position
of
independence
,
betook
himself
to
the
offices
of
Dombey
and
Son
with
a
heavier
countenance
than
he
usually
carried
there
.
  
<EOS>
There
lived
in
those
days
,
round
the
corner
---
in
Bishopsgate
Street
<EOS>
Without
---
one
Brogley
,
sworn
broker
and
appraiser
,
who
kept
a
shop
where
every
description
of
second
-
hand
furniture
was
exhibited
in
the
most
uncomfortable
aspect
,
and
under
circumstances
and
in
combinations
the
most
completely
foreign
to
its
purpose
.
<EOS>
Dozens
of
chairs
hooked
on
to
washing
-
stands
,
which
with
difficulty
poised
themselves
on
the
shoulders
of
sideboards
,
which
in
their
turn
stood
upon
the
wrong
side
of
dining
-
tables
,
gymnastic
with
their
legs
upward
on
the
tops
of
other
dining
-
tables
,
were
among
its
most
reasonable
arrangements
.
<EOS>
A
banquet
array
of
dish
-
covers
,
wine
-
glasses
,
and
decanters
was
generally
to
be
seen
,
spread
forth
upon
the
bosom
of
a
four
-
post
bedstead
,
for
the
entertainment
of
such
genial
company
as
half
-
a
-
dozen
pokers
,
and
a
hall
lamp
.
<EOS>
A
set
of
window
curtains
with
no
windows
belonging
to
them
,
would
be
seen
gracefully
draping
a
barricade
of
chests
of
drawers
,
loaded
with
little
jars
from
chemists
'
shops
;
while
a
homeless
hearthrug
severed
from
its
natural
companion
the
fireside
,
braved
the
shrewd
east
wind
in
its
adversity
,
and
trembled
in
melancholy
accord
with
the
shrill
complainings
of
a
cabinet
piano
,
wasting
away
,
a
string
a
day
,
and
faintly
resounding
to
the
noises
of
the
street
in
its
jangling
and
distracted
brain
.
<EOS>
Of
motionless
clocks
that
never
stirred
a
finger
,
and
seemed
as
incapable
of
being
successfully
wound
up
,
as
the
pecuniary
affairs
of
their
former
owners
,
there
was
always
great
choice
in
Mr
Brogley
's
shop
;
and
various
looking
-
glasses
,
accidentally
placed
at
compound
interest
of
reflection
and
refraction
,
presented
to
the
eye
an
eternal
perspective
of
bankruptcy
and
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Brogley
himself
was
a
moist
-
eyed
,
pink
-
complexioned
,
crisp
-
haired
man
,
of
a
bulky
figure
and
an
easy
temper
---
for
that
class
of
Caius
Marius
who
sits
upon
the
ruins
of
other
people
's
Carthages
,
can
keep
up
his
spirits
well
enough
.
<EOS>
He
had
looked
in
at
Solomon
's
shop
sometimes
to
ask
a
question
about
articles
in
Solomon
's
way
of
business
;
and
Walter
knew
him
sufficiently
to
give
him
good
day
when
they
met
in
the
street
,
but
as
that
was
the
extent
of
the
broker
's
acquaintance
with
Solomon
Gills
also
,
Walter
was
not
a
little
surprised
when
he
came
back
in
the
course
of
the
forenoon
,
agreeably
to
his
promise
,
to
find
Mr
Brogley
sitting
in
the
back
parlour
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
his
hat
hanging
up
behind
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Uncle
Sol
!
"
said
Walter
.
<EOS>
The
old
man
was
sitting
ruefully
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
,
with
his
spectacles
over
his
eyes
,
for
a
wonder
,
instead
on
his
forehead
.
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
Solomon
shook
his
head
,
and
waved
one
hand
towards
the
broker
as
,
introducing
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anything
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Walter
,
with
a
catching
in
his
breath
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
.
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
the
matter
,
"
said
Mr
Brogley
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
let
it
put
you
out
of
the
way
.
"
  
<EOS>
Walter
looked
from
the
broker
to
his
uncle
in
mute
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
"
said
Mr
Brogley
,
"
there
's
a
little
payment
on
a
bond
debt
---
three
hundred
and
seventy
odd
,
over
due
:
<EOS>
and
I
'm
in
possession
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
possession
!
"
cried
Walter
,
looking
round
at
the
shop
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr
Brogley
,
in
confidential
assent
,
and
nodding
his
head
as
if
he
would
urge
the
advisability
of
their
all
being
comfortable
together
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
an
execution
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
it
put
you
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
I
come
myself
,
because
of
keeping
it
quiet
and
sociable
.
<EOS>
You
know
me
.
<EOS>
It
's
quite
private
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Uncle
Sol
!
"
faltered
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wally
,
my
boy
,
"
returned
his
uncle
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
Such
a
calamity
never
happened
to
me
before
.
<EOS>
I
'm
an
old
man
to
begin
.
"
<EOS>
Pushing
up
his
spectacles
again
(
for
they
were
useless
any
longer
to
conceal
his
emotion
)
,
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hand
,
and
sobbed
aloud
,
and
his
tears
fell
down
upon
his
coffee
-
coloured
waistcoat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Uncle
Sol
!
<EOS>
Pray
!
<EOS>
oh
do
n't
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Walter
,
who
really
felt
a
thrill
of
terror
in
seeing
the
old
man
weep
.
<EOS>
"
For
God
's
sake
do
n't
do
that
.
<EOS>
Mr
Brogley
,
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
recommend
you
looking
up
a
friend
or
so
,
"
said
Mr
Brogley
,
"
and
talking
it
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Walter
,
catching
at
anything
.
"
<EOS>
Certainly
!
<EOS>
Thankee
.
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
's
the
man
,
Uncle
.
<EOS>
Wait
till
I
run
to
Captain
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
Keep
your
eye
upon
my
Uncle
,
will
you
,
Mr
Brogley
,
and
make
him
as
comfortable
as
you
can
while
I
am
gone
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
despair
,
Uncle
Sol
.
<EOS>
Try
and
keep
a
good
heart
,
there
's
a
dear
fellow
!
"
  
<EOS>
Saying
this
with
great
fervour
,
and
disregarding
the
old
man
's
broken
remonstrances
,
Walter
dashed
out
of
the
shop
again
as
hard
as
he
could
go
;
and
having
hurried
round
to
the
office
to
excuse
himself
on
the
plea
of
his
uncle
's
sudden
illness
,
set
off
,
full
speed
,
for
Captain
Cuttle
's
residence
.
  
<EOS>
Everything
seemed
altered
as
he
ran
along
the
streets
.
<EOS>
There
were
the
usual
entanglement
and
noise
of
carts
,
drays
,
omni
-
buses
,
waggons
,
and
foot
passengers
,
but
the
misfortune
that
had
fallen
on
the
wooden
midshipman
made
it
strange
and
new
.
<EOS>
Houses
and
shopswere
different
from
what
they
used
to
be
,
and
bore
Mr
Brogley
's
warrant
on
their
fronts
in
large
character
.
<EOS>
The
broker
seemed
to
have
got
hold
of
the
very
churches
;
for
their
spires
rose
into
the
sky
with
an
unwonted
air
.
<EOS>
Even
the
sky
itself
was
changed
,
and
had
an
execution
in
it
plainly
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
lived
on
the
brink
of
a
little
canal
near
the
India
Docks
,
where
there
was
a
swivel
bridge
which
opened
now
and
then
to
let
some
wandering
monster
of
a
ship
come
roaming
up
the
street
like
a
stranded
leviathan
.
<EOS>
The
gradual
change
from
land
to
water
,
on
the
approach
to
Captain
Cuttle
's
lodgings
,
was
curious
.
<EOS>
It
began
with
the
erection
of
flag
-
staffs
,
as
appurtenances
to
public
-
houses
;
then
came
slop
-
sellers
'
shops
,
with
Guernsey
shirts
,
sou'wester
hats
,
and
canvas
pantaloons
,
at
once
the
tightest
and
the
loosest
of
their
order
,
hanging
up
outside
.
<EOS>
These
were
succeeded
by
anchor
and
chain
-
cable
forges
,
where
sledge
-
hammers
were
dinging
upon
iron
all
day
long
.
<EOS>
Then
came
rows
of
houses
,
with
little
vanesurmounted
masts
uprearing
themselves
from
among
the
scarlet
beans
.
<EOS>
Then
ditches
.
<EOS>
Then
pollard
willows
.
<EOS>
Then
more
ditches
.
<EOS>
Then
unaccountable
patches
of
dirty
water
,
hardly
to
be
descried
,
for
the
ships
that
covered
them
.
<EOS>
Then
,
the
air
was
perfumed
with
chips
;
and
all
other
trades
were
swallowed
up
in
mast
,
oar
,
and
block
-
making
,
and
boat
-
building
.
<EOS>
Then
,
the
ground
grew
marshy
and
unsettled
.
<EOS>
Then
,
there
was
nothing
to
be
smelt
but
rum
and
sugar
.
<EOS>
Then
,
Captain
Cuttle
's
lodgings
---
at
once
a
first
floor
and
a
top
story
,
in
Brig
Place
---
were
close
before
you
.
  
<EOS>
The
captain
was
one
of
those
timber
-
looking
men
,
suits
of
oak
as
well
as
hearts
,
whom
it
is
almost
impossible
for
the
liveliest
imagination
to
separate
from
any
part
of
their
dress
,
however
insignificant
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
when
Walter
knocked
at
the
door
,
and
the
Captain
instantly
poked
his
head
out
of
one
of
his
little
front
windows
,
and
hailed
him
,
with
the
hard
glazed
hat
already
on
it
,
and
the
shirt
-
collar
like
a
sail
,
and
the
wide
suite
of
blue
,
all
standing
as
usual
,
Walter
was
as
fully
persuaded
that
he
was
always
in
that
state
,
as
if
the
Captain
had
been
a
bird
and
those
had
been
his
feathers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wal'r
,
my
lad
!
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Stand
by
and
knock
again
.
<EOS>
Hard
!
<EOS>
It
's
washing
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
Walter
,
in
his
impatience
,
gave
a
prodigious
thump
with
the
knocker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hard
it
is
!
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
,
and
immediately
drew
in
his
head
,
as
if
he
expected
a
squall
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
mistaken
:
for
a
widow
lady
,
with
her
sleeves
rolled
up
to
her
shoulders
,
and
her
arms
frothy
with
soap
-
suds
and
smoking
with
hot
water
,
replied
to
the
summons
with
startling
rapidity
.
<EOS>
Before
she
looked
at
Walter
she
looked
at
the
knocker
,
and
then
,
measuring
him
with
her
eyes
from
head
to
foot
,
said
she
wondered
he
had
left
any
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
's
at
home
,
I
know
,
"
said
Walter
with
a
conciliatory
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
?
<EOS>
"
replied
the
widow
lady
.
"
<EOS>
In
-
deed
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
just
been
speaking
to
me
,
"
said
Walter
,
in
breathless
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
he
?
<EOS>
"
replied
the
widow
lady
.
"
<EOS>
Then
p'raps
you
'll
give
him
Mrs
MacStinger
's
respects
,
and
say
that
the
next
time
he
lowers
himself
and
his
lodgings
by
talking
out
of
winder
she
'll
thank
him
to
come
down
and
open
the
door
too
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
MacStinger
spoke
loud
,
and
listened
for
any
observations
that
might
be
offered
from
the
first
floor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
mention
it
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
if
you
'll
have
the
goodness
to
let
me
in
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
For
he
was
repelled
by
a
wooden
fortification
extending
across
the
doorway
,
and
put
there
to
prevent
the
little
Mac
Stingers
in
their
moments
of
recreation
from
tumbling
down
the
steps
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
boy
that
can
knock
my
door
down
,
"
said
Mrs
MacStinger
,
contemptuously
,
"
can
get
over
that
,
I
should
hope
!
"
<EOS>
But
Walter
,
taking
this
as
a
permission
to
enter
,
and
getting
over
it
,
Mrs
MacStinger
immediately
demanded
whether
an
Englishwoman
's
house
was
her
castle
or
not
;
and
whether
she
was
to
be
broke
in
upon
by
"
raff
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
these
subjects
her
thirst
for
information
was
still
very
importunate
,
when
Walter
,
having
made
his
way
up
the
little
staircase
through
an
artificial
fog
occasioned
by
the
washing
,
which
covered
the
banisters
with
a
clammy
perspiration
,
entered
Captain
Cuttle
's
room
,
and
found
that
gentleman
in
ambush
behind
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
owed
her
a
penny
,
Wal'r
,
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
,
in
a
low
voice
,
and
with
visible
marks
of
trepidation
on
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Done
her
a
world
of
good
turns
,
and
the
children
too
.
<EOS>
Vixen
at
times
,
though
.
<EOS>
Whew
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
go
away
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
said
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dursn't
do
it
,
Wal'r
,
"
returned
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
She
'd
find
me
out
,
wherever
I
went
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
.
<EOS>
How
's
Gills
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
was
dining
(
in
his
hat
)
off
cold
loin
of
mutton
,
porter
,
and
some
smoking
hot
potatoes
,
which
he
had
cooked
himself
,
and
took
out
of
a
little
saucepan
before
the
fire
as
he
wanted
them
.
<EOS>
He
unscrewed
his
hook
at
dinnertime
,
and
screwed
a
knife
into
its
wooden
socket
instead
,
with
which
he
had
already
begun
to
peel
one
of
these
potatoes
for
Walter
.
<EOS>
His
rooms
were
very
small
,
and
strongly
impregnated
with
tobacco
-
smoke
,
but
snug
enough
:
everything
being
stowed
away
,
as
if
there
were
an
earthquake
regularly
every
half
-
hour
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
's
Gills
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
Walter
,
who
had
by
this
time
recovered
his
breath
,
and
lost
his
spirits
---
or
such
temporary
spirits
as
his
rapid
journey
had
given
him
---
looked
at
his
questioner
for
a
moment
,
said
"
Oh
,
Captain
Cuttle
!
"
and
burst
into
tears
.
  
<EOS>
No
words
can
describe
the
Captain
's
consternation
at
this
sight
.
<EOS>
Mrs
MacStinger
faded
into
nothing
before
it
.
<EOS>
He
dropped
the
potato
and
the
fork
---
and
would
have
dropped
the
knife
too
if
he
could
---
and
sat
gazing
at
the
boy
,
as
if
he
expected
to
hear
next
moment
that
a
gulf
had
opened
in
the
City
,
which
had
swallowed
up
his
old
friend
,
coffee
-
coloured
suit
,
buttons
,
chronometer
,
spectacles
and
all
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
Walter
told
him
what
was
really
the
matter
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
,
started
up
into
full
activity
.
<EOS>
He
emptied
out
of
a
little
tin
canister
on
the
top
shelf
of
the
cupboard
,
his
whole
stock
of
ready
money
(
amounting
to
thirteen
pounds
and
half
-
a
-
crown
)
,
which
he
transferred
to
one
of
the
pockets
of
his
square
blue
coat
;
further
enriched
that
repository
with
the
contents
of
his
plate
chest
,
consisting
of
two
withered
atomies
of
tea
-
spoons
,
and
an
obsolete
pair
of
knock
-
knee'd
sugar
-
tongs
;
pulled
up
his
immense
doublecased
silver
watch
from
the
depths
in
which
it
reposed
,
to
assure
himself
that
that
valuable
was
sound
and
whole
;
re
-
attached
the
hook
to
his
right
wrist
;
and
seizing
the
stick
covered
over
with
knobs
,
bade
Walter
come
along
.
  
<EOS>
Remembering
,
however
,
in
the
midst
of
his
virtuous
excitement
,
that
Mrs
MacStinger
might
be
lying
in
wait
below
,
Captain
Cuttle
hesitated
at
last
,
not
without
glancing
at
the
window
,
as
if
he
had
some
thoughts
of
escaping
by
that
unusual
means
of
egress
,
rather
than
encounter
his
terrible
enemy
.
<EOS>
He
decided
,
however
,
in
favour
of
stratagem
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wal'r
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
with
a
timid
wink
,
"
go
afore
,
my
lad
.
<EOS>
Sing
out
,
"
good
-
bye
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
when
you
're
in
the
passage
,
and
shut
the
door
.
<EOS>
Then
wait
at
the
corner
of
the
street
'
till
you
see
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
These
directions
were
not
issued
without
a
previous
knowledge
of
the
enemy
's
tactics
,
for
when
Walter
got
down
stairs
,
Mrs
MacStinger
glided
out
of
the
little
back
kitchen
,
like
an
avenging
spirit
.
<EOS>
But
not
gliding
out
upon
the
Captain
,
as
she
had
expected
,
she
merely
made
a
further
allusion
to
the
knocker
,
and
glided
in
again
.
  
<EOS>
Some
five
minutes
elapsed
before
Captain
Cuttle
could
summon
courage
to
attempt
his
escape
;
for
Walter
waited
so
long
at
the
street
corner
,
looking
back
at
the
house
,
before
there
were
any
symptoms
of
the
hard
glazed
hat
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
Captain
burst
out
of
the
door
with
the
suddenness
of
an
explosion
,
and
coming
towards
him
at
a
great
pace
,
and
never
once
looking
over
his
shoulder
,
pretended
,
as
soon
as
they
were
well
out
of
the
street
,
to
whistle
a
tune
.
  
<EOS>
"
Uncle
much
hove
down
,
Wal'r
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
Captain
,
as
they
were
walking
along
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
so
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
seen
him
this
morning
,
you
would
never
have
forgotten
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Walk
fast
,
Wal'r
,
my
lad
,
"
returned
the
Captain
,
mending
his
pace
;
"
and
walk
the
same
all
the
days
of
your
life
.
<EOS>
Over
-
haul
the
catechism
for
that
advice
,
and
keep
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
was
too
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
of
Solomon
Gills
,
mingled
perhaps
with
some
reflections
on
his
late
escape
from
Mrs
MacStinger
,
to
offer
any
further
quotations
on
the
way
for
Walter
's
moral
improvement
.
<EOS>
They
interchanged
no
other
word
until
they
arrived
at
old
Sol
's
door
,
where
the
unfortunate
wooden
midshipman
,
with
his
instrument
at
his
eye
,
seemed
to
be
surveying
the
whole
horizon
in
search
of
some
friend
to
help
him
out
of
his
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gills
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
Captain
,
hurrying
into
the
back
parlour
,
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
quite
tenderly
.
<EOS>
"
Lay
your
head
well
to
the
wind
,
and
we
'll
fight
through
it
.
<EOS>
All
you
've
got
to
do
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
with
the
solemnity
of
a
man
who
was
delivering
himself
of
one
of
the
most
precious
practical
tenets
ever
discovered
by
human
wisdom
,
"
is
to
lay
your
head
well
to
the
wind
,
and
we
'll
fight
through
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Old
Sol
returned
the
pressure
of
his
hand
,
and
thanked
him
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
then
,
with
a
gravity
suitable
to
the
nature
of
the
occasion
,
put
down
upon
the
table
the
two
tea
-
spoons
and
the
sugar
-
tongs
,
the
silver
watch
,
and
the
ready
money
;
and
asked
Mr
Brogley
,
the
broker
,
what
the
damage
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
!
<EOS>
What
do
you
make
of
it
?
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Lord
help
you
!
"
<EOS>
returned
the
broker
;
"
you
do
n't
suppose
that
property
's
of
any
use
,
do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
inquired
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
The
amount
's
three
hundred
and
seventy
,
odd
,
"
replied
the
broker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
returned
the
Captain
,
though
he
was
evidently
dismayed
by
the
figures
:
"
all
's
fish
that
comes
to
your
net
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Mr
Brogley
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
sprats
an't
whales
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
philosophy
of
this
observation
seemed
to
strike
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
He
ruminated
for
a
minute
;
eyeing
the
broker
,
meanwhile
,
as
a
deep
genius
;
and
then
called
the
instrument
-
maker
aside
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gills
,
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
what
's
the
bearings
of
this
business
?
<EOS>
Who
's
the
creditor
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hush
!
"
returned
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
Come
away
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
speak
before
Wally
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
matter
of
security
for
Wally
's
father
---
an
old
bond
.
<EOS>
I
've
paid
a
good
deal
of
it
,
Ned
,
but
the
times
are
so
bad
with
me
that
I
ca
n't
do
more
just
now
.
<EOS>
I
've
foreseen
it
,
but
I
could
n't
help
it
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
before
Wally
,
for
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
got
some
money
,
have
n't
you
?
"
whispered
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
---
oh
yes
---
I
've
got
some
,
"
returned
old
Sol
,
first
putting
his
hands
into
his
empty
pockets
,
and
then
squeezing
his
Welsh
wig
between
them
,
as
if
he
thought
he
might
wring
some
gold
out
of
it
;
"
but
I
---
the
little
I
have
got
,
is
n't
convertible
,
Ned
;
it
ca
n't
be
got
at
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
trying
to
do
something
with
it
for
Wally
,
and
I
'm
old
fashioned
,
and
behind
the
time
.
<EOS>
It
's
here
and
there
,
and
---
and
,
in
short
,
it
's
as
good
as
nowhere
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
looking
in
bewilderment
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
so
much
the
air
of
a
half
-
witted
person
who
had
been
hiding
his
money
in
a
variety
of
places
,
and
had
forgotten
where
,
that
the
Captain
followed
his
eyes
,
not
without
a
faint
hope
that
he
might
remember
some
few
hundred
pounds
concealed
up
the
chimney
,
or
down
in
the
cellar
.
<EOS>
But
Solomon
Gills
knew
better
than
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
behind
the
time
altogether
,
my
dear
Ned
,
"
said
Sol
,
in
resigned
despair
,
"
a
long
way
.
<EOS>
It
's
no
use
my
lagging
on
so
far
behind
it
.
<EOS>
The
stock
had
better
be
sold
---
it
's
worth
more
than
this
debt
---
and
I
had
better
go
and
die
somewhere
,
on
the
balance
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
any
energy
left
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
understand
things
.
<EOS>
This
had
better
be
the
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
Let'em
sell
the
stock
and
take
him
down
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
pointing
feebly
to
the
wooden
midshipman
,
"
and
let
us
both
be
broken
up
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
d'ye
mean
to
do
with
Wal'r
?
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
There
,
there
!
<EOS>
Sit
ye
down
,
Gills
,
sit
ye
down
,
and
let
me
think
o
'
this
.
<EOS>
If
I
warn't
a
man
on
a
small
annuity
,
that
was
large
enough
till
to
-
day
,
I
had
n't
need
to
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
you
only
lay
your
head
well
to
the
wind
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
again
administering
that
unanswerable
piece
of
consolation
,
"
and
you
're
all
right
!
"
  
<EOS>
Old
Sol
thanked
him
from
his
heart
,
and
went
and
laid
it
against
the
back
parlour
fire
-
place
instead
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
walked
up
and
down
the
shop
for
some
time
,
cogitating
profoundly
,
and
bringing
his
bushy
black
eyebrows
to
bear
so
heavily
on
his
nose
,
like
clouds
setting
on
a
mountain
,
that
Walter
was
afraid
to
offer
any
interruption
to
the
current
of
his
reflections
.
<EOS>
Mr
Brogley
,
who
was
averse
to
being
any
constraint
upon
the
party
,
and
who
had
an
ingenious
cast
of
mind
,
went
,
softly
whistling
,
among
,
the
stock
;
rattling
weather
-
glasses
,
shaking
compasses
as
if
they
were
physic
,
catching
up
keys
with
loadstones
,
looking
through
telescopes
,
endeavouring
to
make
himself
acquainted
with
the
use
of
the
globes
setting
parallel
rulers
astride
on
to
his
nose
,
and
amusing
himself
with
other
philosophical
transactions
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wal'r
?
"
said
the
Captain
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
,
Captain
Cuttle
?
"
cried
Walter
,
with
great
animation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
this
way
,
my
lad
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Stock
's
one
security
.
<EOS>
I
'm
another
.
<EOS>
Your
governor
's
the
man
to
advance
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dombey
!
"
<EOS>
faltered
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
nodded
gravely
.
"
<EOS>
Look
at
him
,
"
he
said
,
"
Look
at
Gills
.
<EOS>
If
they
was
to
sell
of
these
things
now
,
he
'd
die
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
he
would

<EOS>
We
must
n't
leave
a
stone
unturned
---
and
there
's
a
stone
for
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
stone
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
!
<EOS>
faltered
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
run
round
to
the
office
,
first
of
all

and
see
if
he
's
there
,
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
,
clapping
him
on
the
back
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quick
!
"
  
<EOS>
Walter
felt
he
must
not
dispute
the
command
---
a
glance
at
his
uncle
would
have
determined
him
if
he
had
felt
otherwise
---
and
disappeared
to
execute
it
.
<EOS>
He
soon
returned
,
out
of
breath
,
to
say
that
Mr
Dombey
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
It
was
Saturday
,
and
he
had
gone
to
Brighton
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
,
Wal'r
!
"
said
the
Captain
,
who
seemed
to
have
prepared
himself
for
this
contingency
in
his
absence
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
go
to
Brighton
.
<EOS>
I
'll
back
you
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
I
'll
back
you
,
Wal'r
.
<EOS>
We
'll
go
to
Brighton
by
the
afternoon
's
coach
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
the
application
must
be
made
to
Mr
Dombey
at
all
,
which
was
awful
to
think
of
,
Walter
felt
that
he
would
rather
prefer
it
alone
and
unassisted
,
than
backed
by
the
personal
influence
of
Captain
Cuttle
,
to
which
he
hardly
thought
Mr
Dombey
would
attach
much
weight
.
<EOS>
But
as
the
Captain
appeared
to
be
of
quite
another
opinion
,
and
was
bent
upon
it
,
and
as
his
friendship
was
too
zealous
and
serious
to
be
trifled
with
by
one
so
much
younger
than
himself
,
he
forbore
to
hint
the
least
objection
.
<EOS>
Cuttle
,
therefore
,
taking
a
hurried
leave
of
Solomon
Gills
,
and
returning
the
ready
money
,
the
tea
-
spoons
,
the
sugar
-
tongs
,
and
the
silver
watch
,
to
his
pocket
---
with
a
view
,
as
Walter
thought
,
with
horror
,
to
making
a
gorgeous
impression
on
Mr
Dombey
---
bore
him
off
to
the
coach
-
office
,
without
a
minute
's
delay
,
and
repeatedly
assured
him
,
on
the
road
,
that
he
would
stick
by
him
to
the
last
.

Containing

<EOS>
MAJOR
BAGSTOCK
,
after
long
and
frequent
observation
of
Paul
,
across
Princess
's
Place
,
through
his
double
-
barrelled
opera
-
glass
;
and
after
receiving
many
minute
reports
,
daily
,
weekly
,
and
monthly
,
on
that
subject
,
from
the
native
who
kept
himself
in
constant
communication
with
Miss
Tox
's
maid
for
that
purpose
;
came
to
the
conclusion
that
Dombey
,
Sir
,
was
a
man
to
be
known
,
and
that
JB
was
the
boy
to
make
his
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
,
however
,
maintaining
her
reserved
behaviour
,
and
frigidly
declining
to
understand
the
Major
whenever
he
called
(
which
he
often
did
)
on
any
little
fishing
excursion
connected
with
this
project
,
the
Major
,
in
spite
of
his
constitutional
toughness
and
slyness
,
was
fain
to
leave
the
accomplishment
of
his
desire
in
some
measure
to
chance
,
"
which
,
"
as
he
was
used
to
observe
with
chuckles
at
his
club
,
"
has
been
fifty
to
one
in
favour
of
Joey
B
,
Sir
,
ever
since
his
elder
brother
died
of
Yellow
Jack
in
the
West
Indies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
some
time
coming
to
his
aid
in
the
present
instance
,
but
it
befriended
him
at
last
.
<EOS>
When
the
dark
servant
,
with
full
particulars
,
reported
Miss
Tox
absent
on
Brighton
service
,
the
Major
was
suddenly
touched
with
affectionate
reminiscences
of
his
friend
Bill
Bitherstone
of
Bengal
,
who
had
written
to
ask
him
,
if
he
ever
went
that
way
,
to
bestow
a
call
upon
his
only
son
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
same
dark
servant
reported
Paul
at
Mrs
Pipchin
's
,
and
the
Major
,
referring
to
the
letter
favoured
by
Master
Bitherstone
on
his
arrival
in
England
---
to
which
he
had
never
had
the
least
idea
of
paying
any
attention
---
saw
the
opening
that
presented
itself
,
he
was
made
so
rabid
by
the
gout
,
with
which
he
happened
to
be
then
laid
up
,
that
he
threw
a
footstool
at
the
dark
servant
in
return
for
his
intelligence
,
and
swore
he
would
be
the
death
of
the
rascal
before
he
had
done
with
him
:
which
the
dark
servant
was
more
than
half
disposed
to
believe
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
the
Major
being
released
from
his
fit
,
went
one
Saturday
growling
down
to
Brighton
,
with
the
native
behind
him
;
apostrophizing
Miss
Tox
all
the
way
,
and
gloating
over
the
prospect
of
carrying
by
storm
the
distinguished
friend
to
whom
she
attached
so
much
mystery
,
and
for
whom
she
had
deserted
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
,
Ma'am
,
would
you
!
"
said
the
Major
,
straining
with
vindictiveness
,
and
swelling
every
already
swollen
vein
in
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
Would
you
give
Joey
B
the
go
-
by
,
Ma'am
?
<EOS>
Not
yet
,
ma'am
,
not
yet

<EOS>
Damme

<EOS>
Joe

<EOS>
You

Ma'am

<EOS>
Tough
,
Sir
,
tough
is
Joseph
.
<EOS>
Tough
,
and
de
-
vilish
sly
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
very
tough
indeed
Master
Bitherstone
found
him
,
when
he
took
that
young
gentleman
out
for
a
walk
.
<EOS>
But
the
Major
,
with
his
complexion
like
a
Stilton
cheese
,
and
his
eyes
like
a
prawn
's
,
went
roving
about
,
perfectly
indifferent
to
Master
Bitherstone
's
amusement
,
and
dragging
Master
Bitherstone
along
,
while
he
looked
about
him
high
and
low
,
for
Mr
Dombey
and
his
children
.
  
<EOS>
In
good
time
the
Major
,
previously
instructed
by
Mrs
Pipchin
,
spied
out
Paul
and
Florence
,
and
bore
down
upon
them
;
there
being
a
stately
gentleman
(
Mr
Dombey
,
doubtless
)
in
their
company
.
<EOS>
Charging
with
Master
Bitherstone
into
the
very
heart
of
the
little
squadron
,
it
fell
out
,
of
course
,
that
Master
Bitherstone
spoke
to
his
fellow
-
sufferers
.
<EOS>
Upon
that
the
Major
stopped
to
notice
and
admire
them
;
remembered
with
amazement
that
he
had
seen
and
spoken
to
them
at
his
friend
Miss
Tox
's
in
Princess
's
Place
;
opined
that
Paul
was
a
devilish
fine
fellow
,
and
his
own
little
friend
;
inquired
if
he
remembered
Joey
B
the
Major
;
and
finally
,
with
a
sudden
recollection
of
the
conventionalities
of
life
,
turned
and
apologised
to
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
my
little
friend
here
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Major
,
"
makes
a
boy
of
me
again
.
<EOS>
An
old
soldier
,
Sir
---
Major
Bagstock
,
at
your
service
---
is
not
ashamed
to
confess
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
the
Major
lifted
his
hat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Damme
,
Sir
,
"
cried
the
Major
with
sudden
warmth
,
"
I
envy
you
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
recollected
himself
,
and
added
,
"
Excuse
my
freedom
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
begged
he
would
n't
mention
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
An
old

said
the
Major
,
"
a

<EOS>

I

Mr

"

said
the
Major
,
"
it

<EOS>
It

a
name
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Major
firmly
,
as
if
he
defied
Mr
Dombey
to
contradict
him
,
and
would
feel
it
his
painful
duty
to
bully
him
if
he
did
,
"
that
is
known
and
honoured
in
the
British
possessions

It
is
a

that
a
man
is
proud
to
recognise
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
adulatory
in
Joseph
Bagstock

Sir

<EOS>
His
Royal
Highness
the
Duke

observed
on

<EOS>
By

said
the
Major
,
solemnly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
good
enough
to
rate
it
higher
than
it
deserves

perhaps

returned
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
No

"
said
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
My
little
friend
here

nothing

That

said
the
Major
in
a
lower
tone
,
"
will
live
in
history
.
<EOS>
That
boy
,
Sir
,
is
not
a
common
production

<EOS>
Take
care

,
Mr
Dombey

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
seemed
to
intimate
that
he
would
endeavour
to
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
is
a
boy
here
,
Sir
,
"
pursued
the
Major
,
confidentially
,
and
giving
him
a
thrust
with
his
cane
.
<EOS>
"
Son
of
Bitherstone
of
Bengal
.
<EOS>
Bill
Bitherstone
formerly
of

<EOS>
That
boy

<EOS>
Wherever
you
went

Sir
,
you
heard

Bill
Bitherstone

<EOS>
Am

boy
's
defects

<EOS>
By
no
means
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
fool

Sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
glanced
at
the
libelled
Master
Bitherstone
,
of
whom
he
knew
at
least
as
much
as
the
Major
did
,
and
said
,
in
quite
a
complacent
manner
,
"
Really
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
what
he
is
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
fool

<EOS>
Joe
Bagstock
never
minces
matters
.
<EOS>
The
son
of
my
old
friend
Bill
Bitherstone
,
of
Bengal
,
is
a
born
fool
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
Here
the
Major
laughed
till
he
was
almost
black
.
<EOS>
"
My
little
friend
is
destined
for
a
public
school
,
I
presume
,
Mr
Dombey
?
"
said
the
Major
when
he
had
recovered
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
quite
decided
,
"
returned
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
He
is
delicate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
's
delicate
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Major
,
"
you
are
right
.
<EOS>
None
but
the
tough
fellows
could
live
through
it
,
Sir
,
at
Sandhurst
.
<EOS>
We
put
each
other
to
the
torture
there
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
We
roasted
the
new
fellows
at
a
slow
fire
,
and
hung'em
out
of
a
three
pair
of
stairs
window
,
with
their
heads
downwards
.
<EOS>
Joseph
Bagstock
,
Sir
,
was
held
out
of
the
window
by
the
heels
of
his
boots
,
for
thirteen
minutes
by
the
college
clock
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
might
have
appealed
to
his
countenance
,
in
corroboration
of
this
story
.
<EOS>
It
certainly
looked
as
if
he
had
hung
out
a
little
too
long
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
made
us
what
we
were
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Major
,
settling
his
shirt
frill
.
<EOS>
"
We
were
iron
,
Sir
,
and
it
forged
us
.
<EOS>
Are
you
remaining
here
,
Mr
Dombey
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
generally
come
down
once
a
week
,
Major
,
"
returned
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
I
stay
at
the
Bedford
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
the
honour
of
calling
at
the
Bedford
,
Sir
,
if
you
'll
permit
me
,
"
said
the
Major
.
"
<EOS>
Joey
B
,
Sir
,
is
not
in
general
a
calling
man
,
but
Mr
Dombey
's
is
not
a
common
name
.
<EOS>
I
am
much
indebted
to
my
little
friend
,
Sir
,
for
the
honour
of
this
introduction
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
made
a
very
gracious
reply
;
and
Major
Bagstock
,
having
patted
Paul
on
the
head
,
and
said
of
Florence
that
her
eyes
would
play
the
Devil
with
the
youngsters
before
long
---
"
and
the
oldsters
too
,
Sir
,
if
you
come
to
that
,
"
added
the
Major
,
chuckling
very
much
---
stirred
up
Master
Bitherstone
with
his
walking
-
stick
,
and
departed
with
that
young
gentleman
,
at
a
kind
of
half
-
trot
;
rolling
his
head
and
coughing
with
great
dignity
,
as
he
staggered
away
,
with
his
legs
very
wide
asunder
.
  
<EOS>
In
fulfilment
of
his
promise
,
the
Major
afterwards
called
on
Mr
Dombey
;
and
Mr
Dombey
,
having
referred
to
the
army
list
,
afterwards
called
on
the
Major
.
<EOS>
Then
the
Major
called
at
Mr
Dombey
's
house
in
town
;
and
came
down
again
,
in
the
same
coach
as
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
Mr
Dombey
and
the
Major
got
on
uncommonly
well
together
,
and
uncommonly
fast
:
and
Mr
Dombey
observed
of
the
Major
,
to
his
sister
,
that
besides
being
quite
a
military
man
he
was
really
something
more
,
as
he
had
a
very
admirable
idea
of
the
importance
of
things
unconnected
with
his
own
profession
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
Mr
Dombey
,
bringing
down
Miss
Tox
and
Mrs
Chick
to
see
the
children
,
and
finding
the
Major
again
at
Brighton
,
invited
him
to
dinner
at
the
Bedford
,
and
complimented
Miss
Tox
highly
,
beforehand
,
on
her
neighbour
and
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
palpitation
of
the
heart
which
these
allusions
occasioned
her
,
they
were
anything
but
disagreeable
to
Miss
Tox
,
as
they
enabled
her
to
be
extremely
interesting
,
and
to
manifest
an
occasional
incoherence
and
distraction
which
she
was
not
at
all
unwilling
to
display
.
<EOS>
The
Major
gave
her
abundant
opportunities
of
exhibiting
this
emotion
:
being
profuse
in
his
complaints
,
at
dinner
,
of
her
desertion
of
him
and
Princess
's
Place
:
and
as
he
appeared
to
derive
great
enjoyment
from
making
them
,
they
all
got
on
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
None
the
worse
on
account
of
the
Major
taking
charge
of
the
whole
conversation
,
and
showing
as
great
an
appetite
in
that
respect
as
in
regard
of
the
various
dainties
on
the
table
,
among
which
he
may
be
almost
said
to
have
wallowed
:
greatly
to
the
aggravation
of
his
inflammatory
tendencies
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
habitual
silence
and
reserve
yielding
readily
to
this
usurpation
<EOS>
,
the
Major
felt
that
he
was
coming
out
and
shining
:
<EOS>
and
in
the
flow
of
spirits
thus
engendered
,
rang
such
an
infinite
number
of
new
changes
on
his
own
name
that
he
quite
astonished
himself
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
they
were
all
very
well
pleased
.
<EOS>
The
Major
was
considered
to
possess
an
inexhaustible
fund
of
conversation
;
and
when
he
took
a
late
farewell
,
after
a
long
rubber
,
Mr
Dombey
again
complimented
the
blushing
Miss
Tox
on
her
neighbour
and
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
But
all
the
way
home
to
his
own
hotel
,
the
Major
incessantly
said
to
himself
,
and
of
himself
,
"
<EOS>
Sly
,
Sir
---
sly
,
Sir
---
de
-
vil
-
ish
sly
!
"
<EOS>
And
when
he
got
there
,
sat
down
in
a
chair
,
and
fell
into
a
silent
fit
of
laughter
,
with
which
he
was
sometimes
seized
,
and
which
was
always
particularly
awful
.
<EOS>
It
held
him
so
long
on
this
occasion
that
the
dark
servant
,
who
stood
watching
him
at
a
distance
,
but
dared
not
for
his
life
approach
,
twice
or
thrice
gave
him
over
for
lost
.
<EOS>
His
whole
form
,
but
especially
his
face
and
head
,
dilated
beyond
all
former
experience
;
and
presented
to
the
dark
man
's
view
,
nothing
but
a
heavy
mass
of
indigo
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
burst
into
a
violent
paroxysm
of
coughing
,
and
when
that
was
a
little
better
burst
into
such
ejaculations
as
the
following
:
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
,
Ma'am
,
would
you
?
<EOS>
Mrs
Dombey
,
eh
,
Ma'am
?
<EOS>
I
think
not
,
Ma'am
.
<EOS>
Not
while
Joe
B
can
put
a
spoke
in
your
wheel
,
Ma'am
.
<EOS>
JB
's
even
with
you
now
,
Ma'am
.
<EOS>
He
is
n't
altogether
bowled
out
,
yet
,
Sir
,
is
n't
Bagstock
.
<EOS>
She
's
deep
,
Sir
,
deep
,
but
Josh
is
deeper
.
<EOS>
Wide
awake
is
old
Joe
---
broad
awake
,
and
staring
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
doubt
of
this
last
assertion
being
true
,
and
to
a
very
fearful
extent
;
as
it
continued
to
be
during
the
greater
part
of
that
night
,
which
the
Major
chiefly
passed
in
similar
exclamations
,
diversified
with
fits
of
coughing
and
choking
that
startled
the
whole
house
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
day
after
this
occasion
(
being
Sunday
)
<EOS>
when
,
as
Mr
Dombey
,
Mrs
Chick
,
and
Miss
Tox
were
sitting
at
breakfast
,
still
eulogising
the
Major
,
Florence
came
running
in
:
her
face
suffused
with
a
bright
colour
,
and
her
eyes
sparkling
joyfully
:
and
cried
,
  
"
Papa
!
<EOS>
papa
!
<EOS>
Here
's
Walter
!
<EOS>
and
he
wo
n't
come
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
cried
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
What
does
she
mean
?
<EOS>
What
is
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Walter
,
Papa
!
"
said
Florence
timidly
;
sensible
of
having
approached
the
presence
with
too
much
familiarity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
found
me
when
I
was
lost
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
she
mean
young
Gay
,
Louisa
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Dombey
,
knitting
his
brows
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Really
,
this
child
's
manners
have
become
very
boisterous
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
mean
young
Gay
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
See
what
it
is
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
hurried
into
the
passage
,
and
returned
with
the
information
that
it
was
young
Gay
,
accompanied
by
a
very
strange
-
looking
person
;
and
that
young
Gay
said
he
would
not
take
the
liberty
of
coming
in
,
hearing
Mr
Dombey
was
at
breakfast
,
but
would
wait
until
Mr
Dombey
should
signify
that
he
might
approach
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
the
boy
to
come
in
now
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
Gay
,
what
is
the
matter
?
<EOS>
Who
sent
you
down
here
?
<EOS>
Was
there
nobody
else
to
come
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Sir
,
"
returned
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
been
sent
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
so
bold
as
to
come
on
my
own
account
,
which
I
hope
you
'll
pardon
when
I
mention
the
cause
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Mr
Dombey
without
attending
to
what
he
said
,
was
looking
impatiently
on
either
side
of
him
(
as
if
he
were
a
pillar
in
his
way
)
at
some
object
behind
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
that
?
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
made
some
mistake
in
the
door
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
'm
very
sorry
to
intrude
with
any
one
,
Sir
,
"
cried
Walter
,
hastily
:
"
but
this
is
---
this
is
Captain
Cuttle
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Wal'r
,
my
lad
,
"
observed
the
Captain
in
a
deep
voice
:
"
stand
by
!
"
  
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
the
Captain
,
coming
a
little
further
in
,
brought
out
his
wide
suit
of
blue
,
his
conspicuous
shirt
-
collar
,
and
his
knobby
nose
in
full
relief
,
and
stood
bowing
to
Mr
Dombey
,
and
waving
his
hook
politely
to
the
ladies
,
with
the
hard
glazed
hat
in
his
one
hand
,
and
a
red
equator
round
his
head
which
it
had
newly
imprinted
there
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
regarded
this
phenomenon
with
amazement
and
indignation
,
and
seemed
by
his
looks
to
appeal
to
Mrs
Chick
and
Miss
Tox
against
it
.
<EOS>
Little
Paul
,
who
had
come
in
after
Florence
,
backed
towards
Miss
Tox
as
the
Captain
waved
his
hook
,
and
stood
on
the
defensive
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Gay
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
got
to
say
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Again
the
Captain
observed
,
as
a
general
opening
of
the
conversation
that
could
not
fail
to
propitiate
all
parties
,
"
Wal'r
,
stand
by
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
Sir
,
"
began
Walter
,
trembling
,
and
looking
down
at
the
ground
,
"
that
I
take
a
very
great
liberty
in
coming
---
indeed
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
should
hardly
have
had
the
courage
to
ask
to
see
you
,
Sir
,
even
after
coming
down
,
I
am
afraid
,
if
I
had
not
overtaken
Miss
Dombey
,
and
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
!
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
following
his
eyes
as
he
glanced
at
the
attentive
Florence
,
and
frowning
unconsciously
as
she
encouraged
him
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
if
you
please
.
"
  
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
observed
the
Captain
,
considering
it
incumbent
on
him
,
as
a
point
of
good
breeding
,
to
support
Mr
Dombey
.
"
<EOS>
Well
said
!
<EOS>
Go
on
,
Wal'r
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
ought
to
have
been
withered
by
the
look
which
Mr
Dombey
bestowed
upon
him
in
acknowledgment
of
his
patronage
.
<EOS>
But
quite
innocent
of
this
,
he
closed
one
eye
in
reply
,
and
gave
Mr
Dombey
to
understand
by
certain
significant
motions
of
his
hook
,
that
Walter
was
a
little
bashful
at
first
,
and
might
be
expected
to
come
out
shortly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
entirely
a
private
and
personal
matter
,
that
has
brought
me
here
,
Sir
,
"
continued
Walter
,
faltering
,
"
and
Captain
Cuttle
---
"
  
"
Here
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
the
Captain
,
as
an
assurance
that
he
was
at
hand
,
and
might
be
relied
upon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
a
very
old
friend
of
my
poor
uncle
's
,
and
a
most
excellent
man
,
Sir
,
"
pursued
Walter
,
raising
his
eyes
with
a
look
of
entreaty
in
the
Captain
's
behalf
,
"
<EOS>
was
so
good
as
to
offer
to
come
with
me
,
which
I
could
hardly
refuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
observed
the
Captain
complacently
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
.
<EOS>
No
call
for
refusing
.
<EOS>
Go
on
,
Wal'r
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
therefore
,
Sir
,
"
said
Walter
,
venturing
to
meet
Mr
Dombey
's
eye
,
and
proceeding
with
better
courage
in
the
very
desperation
of
the
case
,
now
that
there
was
no
avoiding
it
,
"
therefore
I
have
come
,
with
him
,
Sir
,
to
say
that
my
poor
old
uncle
is
in
very
great
affliction
and
distress
.
<EOS>
That
,
through
the
gradual
loss
of
his
business
,
and
not
being
able
to
make
a
payment
,
the
apprehension
of
which
has
weighed
very
heavily
upon
his
mind
,
months
and
months
,
as
indeed
<EOS>
I
know
,
Sir
,
he
has
an
execution
in
his
house
,
and
is
in
danger
of
losing
all
he
has
,
and
breaking
his
heart
.
<EOS>
And
that
if
you
would
,
in
your
kindness
,
and
in
your
old
knowledge
of
him
as
a
respectable
man
,
do
anything
to
help
him
out
of
his
difficulty
,
Sir
,
we
never
could
thank
you
enough
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Walter
's
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
he
spoke
;
and
so
did
those
of
Florence
.
<EOS>
Her
father
saw
them
glistening
,
though
he
appeared
to
look
at
Walter
only
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
very
large
sum
,
Sir
,
"
said
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
More
than
three
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
is
quite
beaten
down
by
his
misfortune
,
it
lies
so
heavy
on
him
;
and
is
quite
unable
to
do
anything
for
his
own
relief
.
<EOS>
He
does
n't
even
know
yet
,
that
I
have
come
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
would
wish
me
to
say
,
Sir
,
"
added
Walter
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
"
exactly
what
it
is
I
want
.
<EOS>
I
really
do
n't
know
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
There
is
my
uncle
's
stock
,
on
which
I
believe
I
may
say
,
confidently
,
there
are
no
other
demands
,
and
there
is
Captain
Cuttle
,
who
would
wish
to
be
security
too
.
<EOS>
I
---
<EOS>
I
hardly
like
to
mention
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
such
earnings
as
mine
;
but
if
you
would
allow
them
---
accumulate
---
payment
---
advance
---
uncle
---
frugal
,
honourable
,
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Walter
trailed
off
,
through
these
broken
sentences
,
into
silence
:
and
stood
,
with
downcast
head
,
before
his
employer
.
  
<EOS>
Considering
this
a
favourable
moment
for
the
display
of
the
valuables
,
Captain
Cuttle
advanced
to
the
table
;
and
clearing
a
space
among
the
breakfast
-
cups
at
Mr
Dombey
's
elbow
,
produced
the
silver
watch
,
the
ready
money
,
the
teaspoons
,
and
the
sugar
-
tongs
;
and
piling
them
up
into
a
heap
that
they
might
look
as
precious
as
possible
,
delivered
himself
of
these
words
:
  
"
<EOS>
Half
a
loaf
's
better
than
no
bread
,
and
the
same
remark
holds
good
with
crumbs
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
few
.
<EOS>
Annuity
of
one
hundred
pound
prannum
also
ready
to
be
made
over
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
a
man
chock
full
of
science
in
the
world
,
it
's
old
Sol
Gills
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
a
lad
of
promise
---
one
flowing
,
"
added
the
Captain
,
in
one
of
his
happy
quotations
,
"
with
milk
and
honey
<EOS>
---
it
's
his
nevy
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
then
withdrew
to
his
former
place
,
where
he
stood
arranging
his
scattered
locks
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
given
the
finishing
touch
to
a
difficult
performance
.
  
<EOS>
When
Walter
ceased
to
speak
,
Mr
Dombey
's
eyes
were
attracted
to
little
Paul
,
who
,
seeing
his
sister
hanging
down
her
head
and
silently
weeping
in
her
commiseration
for
the
distress
she
had
heard
described
,
went
over
to
her
,
and
tried
to
comfort
her
:
looking
at
Walter
and
his
father
as
he
did
so
,
with
a
very
expressive
face
.
<EOS>
After
the
momentary
distraction
of
Captain
Cuttle
's
address
,
which
he
regarded
with
lofty
indifference
,
Mr
Dombey
again
turned
his
eyes
upon
his
son
,
and
sat
steadily
regarding
the
child
,
for
some
moments
,
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
was
this
debt
contracted
for
?
"
asked
Mr
Dombey
,
at
length
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
the
creditor
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
do
n't
know
,
"
replied
the
Captain
,
putting
his
hand
on
Walter
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
It
came
of
helping
a
man
that
's
dead
now
,
and
that
's
cost
my
friend
<EOS>
Gills
many
a
hundred
pound
already
.
<EOS>
More
particulars
in
private
,
if
agreeable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
People
who
have
enough
to
do
to
hold
their
own
way
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
unobservant
of
the
Captain
's
mysterious
signs
behind
Walter
,
and
still
looking
at
his
son
,
"
had
better
be
content
with
their
own
obligations
and
difficulties
,
and
not
increase
them
by
engaging
for
other
men
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
act
of
dishonesty
and
presumption
,
too
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
sternly
;
"
great
presumption
;
for
the
wealthy
could
do
no
more
.
<EOS>
Paul
,
come
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
child
obeyed
:
and
Mr
Dombey
took
him
on
his
knee
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
money
now
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
Look
at
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
Paul
,
whose
eyes
had
wandered
to
his
sister
,
and
to
Walter
,
looked
his
father
in
the
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
money
now
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
;
"
as
much
money
as
young
Gay
has
talked
about
;
what
would
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
it
to
his
old
uncle
,
"
returned
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lend
it
to
his
old
uncle
,
eh
?
"
retorted
Mr
Dombey
.
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
When
you
are
old
enough
,
you
know
,
you
will
share
my
money
,
and
we
shall
use
it
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dombey
and
Son
,
"
interrupted
Paul
,
who
had
been
tutored
early
in
the
phrase
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dombey
and
Son
,
"
repeated
his
father
.
"
<EOS>
Would
you
like
to
begin
to
be
Dombey
and
Son
,
now
,
and
lend
this
money
to
young
Gay
's
uncle
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
you
please
,
Papa
!
"
said
Paul
:
"
and
so
would
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Girls
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
have
nothing
to
do
with
Dombey
and
Son
.
<EOS>
Would
you
like
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Papa
,
yes
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
shall
do
it
,
"
returned
his
father
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
see
,
Paul
,
"
he
added
,
dropping
his
voice
,
"
how
powerful
money
is
,
and
how
anxious
people
are
to
get
it
.
<EOS>
Young
Gay
comes
all
this
way
to
beg
for
money
,
and
you
,
who
are
so
grand
and
great
,
having
got
it
,
are
going
to
let
him
have
it
,
as
a
great
favour
and
obligation
.
"
  
<EOS>
Paul
turned
up
the
old
face
for
a
moment
,
in
which
there
was
a
sharp
understanding
of
the
reference
conveyed
in
these
words
:
but
it
was
a
young
and
childish
face
immediately
afterwards
,
when
he
slipped
down
from
his
father
's
knee
,
and
ran
to
tell
Florence
not
to
cry
any
more
,
for
he
was
going
to
let
young
Gay
have
the
money
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
then
turned
to
a
side
-
table
,
and
wrote
a
note
and
sealed
it
.
<EOS>
During
the
interval
,
Paul
and
Florence
whispered
to
Walter
,
and
Captain
Cuttle
beamed
on
the
three
,
with
such
aspiring
and
ineffably
presumptuous
thoughts
as
Mr
Dombey
never
could
have
believed
in
.
<EOS>
The
note
being
finished
,
Mr
Dombey
turned
round
to
his
former
place
,
and
held
it
out
to
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
that
,
"
he
said
,
"
the
first
thing
to
-
morrow
morning
,
to
Mr
Carker
.
<EOS>
He
will
immediately
take
care
that
one
of
my
people
releases
your
uncle
from
his
present
position
,
by
paying
the
amount
at
issue
;
and
that
such
arrangements
are
made
for
its
repayment
as
may
be
consistent
with
your
uncle
's
circumstances
.
<EOS>
You
will
consider
that
this
is
done
for
you
by
Master
Paul
.
"
  
<EOS>
Walter
,
in
the
emotion
of
holding
in
his
hand
the
means
of
releasing
his
good
uncle
from
his
trouble
,
would
have
endeavoured
to
express
something
of
his
gratitude
and
joy
.
<EOS>
But
Mr
Dombey
stopped
him
short
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
consider
that
it
is
done
,
"
he
repeated
,
"
by
Master
Paul
.
<EOS>
I
have
explained
that
to
him
,
and
he
understands
it
.
<EOS>
I
wish
no
more
to
be
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
As
he
motioned
towards
the
door
,
Walter
could
only
bow
his
head
and
retire
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
,
seeing
that
the
Captain
appeared
about
to
do
the
same
,
interposed
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Sir
,
"
she
said
,
addressing
Mr
Dombey
,
at
whose
munificence
both
she
and
Mrs
Chick
were
shedding
tears
copiously
;
"
I
think
you
have
overlooked
something
.
<EOS>
Pardon
me
,
Mr
Dombey
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
in
the
nobility
of
your
character
,
and
its
exalted
scope
,
you
have
omitted
a
matter
of
detail
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
Miss
Tox
!
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
with
theInstrument
,
"
pursued
Miss
Tox
,
glancing
at
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
has
left
upon
the
table
,
at
your
elbow
"
  
"
Good
Heaven
!
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
sweeping
the
Captain
's
property
from
him
,
as
if
it
were
so
much
crumb
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
Take
these
things
away
.
<EOS>
I
am
obliged
to
you
,
Miss
Tox
;
it
is
like
your
usual
discretion
.
<EOS>
Have
the
goodness
to
take
these
things
away
,
Sir
!
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
felt
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
comply
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
so
much
struck
by
the
magnanimity
of
Mr
Dombey
,
in
refusing
treasures
lying
heaped
up
to
his
hand
,
that
when
he
had
deposited
the
teaspoons
and
sugar
-
tongs
in
one
pocket
,
and
the
ready
money
in
another
,
and
had
lowered
the
great
watch
down
slowly
into
its
proper
vault
,
he
could
not
refrain
from
seizing
that
gentleman
's
right
hand
in
his
own
solitary
left
,
and
while
he
held
it
open
with
his
powerful
fingers
,
bringing
the
hook
down
upon
its
palm
in
a
transport
of
admiration
.
<EOS>
At
this
touch
of
warm
feeling
and
cold
iron
,
Mr
Dombey
shivered
all
over
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
then
kissed
his
hook
to
the
ladies
several
times
,
with
great
elegance
and
gallantry
;
and
having
taken
a
particular
leave
of
Paul
and
Florence
,
accompanied
Walter
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Florence
was
running
after
them
in
the
earnestness
of
her
heart
,
to
send
some
message
to
old
Sol
,
when
Mr
Dombey
,
called
her
back
,
and
bade
her
stay
where
she
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
never
be
a
Dombey
,
my
dear
child
!
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
with
pathetic
reproachfulness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Aunt
,
"
said
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
thankful
to
Papa
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
would
have
run
and
thrown
her
arms
about
his
neck
if
she
had
dared
;
but
as
she
did
not
dare
,
she
glanced
with
thankful
eyes
towards
him
,
as
he
sat
musing
;
sometimes
bestowing
an
uneasy
glance
on
her
,
but
,
for
the
most
part
,
watching
Paul
,
who
walked
about
the
room
with
the
new
-
blown
dignity
of
having
let
young
Gay
have
the
money
.
  
<EOS>
And
young
Gay
---
Walter
---
<EOS>
what
of
him
?
  
<EOS>
He
was
overjoyed
to
purge
the
old
man
's
hearth
from
bailiffs
and
brokers
,
and
to
hurry
back
to
his
uncle
with
the
good
tidings
.
<EOS>
He
was
overjoyed
to
have
it
all
arranged
and
settled
next
day
before
noon
;
and
to
sit
down
at
evening
in
the
little
back
parlour
with
old
Sol
and
Captain
Cuttle
;
and
to
see
the
instrument
-
maker
already
reviving
,
and
hopeful
for
the
future
,
and
feeling
that
the
wooden
midshipman
was
his
own
again
.
<EOS>
But
without
the
least
impeachment
of
his
gratitude
to
Mr
Dombey
,
it
must
be
confessed
that
Walter
was
humbled
and
cast
down
.
<EOS>
It
is
when
our
budding
hopes
are
nipped
beyond
recovery
by
some
rough
wind
,
that
we
are
the
most
disposed
to
picture
to
ourselves
<EOS>
what
flowers
they
might
have
borne
,
if
they
had
flourished
;
and
now
,
when
Walter
found
himself
cut
off
from
that
great
Dombey
height
,
by
the
depth
of
a
new
and
terrible
tumble
,
and
felt
that
all
his
old
wild
fancies
had
been
scattered
to
the
winds
in
the
fall
,
he
began
to
suspect
that
they
might
have
led
him
on
to
harmless
visions
of
aspiring
to
Florence
in
the
remote
distance
of
time
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
viewed
the
subject
in
quite
a
different
light
.
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
entertain
a
belief
that
the
interview
at
which
he
had
assisted
was
so
very
satisfactory
and
encouraging
,
as
to
be
only
a
step
or
two
removed
from
a
regular
betrothal
of
Florence
to
Walter
;
and
that
the
late
transaction
had
immensely
forwarded
,
if
not
thoroughly
established
,
the
Whittingtonian
hopes
.
<EOS>
Stimulated
by
this
conviction
,
and
by
the
improvement
in
the
spirits
of
his
old
friend
,
and
by
his
own
consequent
gaiety
,
he
even
attempted
,
in
favouring
them
with
the
ballad
of
"
Lovely
Peg
"
for
the
third
time
in
one
evening
,
to
make
an
extemporaneous
substitution
of
the
name
"
Florence
;
"
but
finding
this
difficult
,
on
account
of
the
word
Peg
invariably
rhyming
to
leg
(
in
which
personal
beauty
the
original
was
described
as
having
excelled
all
competitors
)
,
he
hit
upon
the
happy
thought
of
changing
it
to
Fle
---
<EOS>
e
---
eg
;
which
he
accordingly
did
,
with
an
archness
almost
supernatural
,
and
a
voice
quite
vociferous
,
notwithstanding
that
the
time
was
close
at
hand
when
he
must
seek
the
abode
of
the
dreadful
Mrs
MacStinger
.

Paul
's
Introduction
to
a
New
Scene
 
<EOS>
MRS
PIPCHIN
'S
constitution
was
made
of
such
hard
metal
,
in
spite
of
its
liability
to
the
fleshly
weaknesses
of
standing
in
need
of
repose
after
chops
,
and
of
requiring
to
be
coaxed
to
sleep
by
the
soporific
agency
of
sweet
-
breads
,
that
it
utterly
set
at
naught
the
predictions
of
Mrs
Wickam
,
and
showed
no
symptoms
of
decline
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
as
Paul
's
rapt
interest
inthe
old
lady
continued
unabated
,
Mrs
Wickam
would
not
budge
an
inch
from
the
position
she
had
taken
up
.
<EOS>
Fortifying
and
entrenching
herself
on
the
strong
ground
of
her
uncle
's
Betsey
Jane
,
she
advised
Miss
Berry
,
as
a
friend
,
to
prepare
herself
for
the
worst
;
and
forewarned
her
that
her
aunt
might
,
at
any
time
,
be
expected
to
go
off
suddenly
,
like
a
powder
-
mill
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Berry
took
it
all
in
good
part
,
and
drudged
and
slaved
away
as
usual
;
perfectly
convinced
that
Mrs
Pipchin
was
one
of
the
most
meritorious
persons
in
the
world
,
and
making
every
day
innumerable
sacrifices
of
herself
upon
the
altar
of
that
noble
old
woman
.
<EOS>
But
all
these
immolations
of
Berry
were
somehow
carried
to
the
credit
of
Mrs
Pipchin
by
Mrs
Pipchin
's
friends
and
admirers
;
and
were
made
to
harmonise
with
,
and
carry
out
,
that
melancholy
fact
of
the
deceased
Mr
Pipchin
having
broken
his
heart
in
the
Peruvian
mines
.
  
<EOS>
For
example
,
there
was
an
honest
grocer
and
general
dealer
in
the
retail
line
of
business
,
between
whom
and
Mrs
Pipchin
there
was
a
small
memorandum
book
,
with
a
greasy
red
cover
,
perpetually
in
question
,
and
concerning
which
divers
secret
councils
and
conferences
were
continually
being
held
between
the
parties
to
the
register
,
on
the
mat
in
the
passage
,
and
with
closed
doors
in
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
there
wanting
dark
hints
from
Master
Bitherstone
(
whose
temper
had
been
made
re
-
vengeful
by
the
solar
heats
of
India
acting
on
his
blood
)
,
of
balances
unsettled
,
and
of
a
failure
,
on
one
occasion
with
his
memory
,
in
the
supply
of
moist
sugar
at
tea
-
time
.
<EOS>
This
grocer
being
a
bachelor
,
and
not
a
man
who
looked
upon
the
surface
for
beauty
,
had
once
made
honourable
offers
for
the
hand
of
Berry
,
which
Mrs
Pipchin
had
,
with
contumely
and
scorn
,
rejected
.
<EOS>
Everybody
said
how
laudable
this
was
in
Mrs
Pipchin
,
relict
of
a
man
who
had
died
of
the
Peruvian
mines
;
and
what
a
staunch
,
high
,
independent
spirit
the
old
lady
had
.
<EOS>
But
nobody
said
anything
about
poor
Berry
,
who
cried
for
six
weeks
(
being
soundly
rated
by
her
good
aunt
all
the
time
)
,
and
lapsed
into
a
state
of
hopeless
spinsterhood
.
   
<EOS>
"
Berry
's
very
fond
of
you
<EOS>
,
ai
n't
she
?
"
<EOS>
Paul
once
asked
Mrs
Pipchin
when
they
were
sitting
by
the
fire
with
the
cat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mrs
Pipchin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
asked
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
!
"
returned
the
disconcerted
old
lady
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
ask
such
things
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
why
are
you
fond
of
your
sister
Florence
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
she
's
very
good
,
"
said
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
nobody
like
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
"
retorted
Mrs
Pipchin
,
shortly
,
"
and
there
's
nobody
like
me
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ai
n't
there
really
though
?
"
asked
Paul
,
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
,
and
looking
at
her
very
hard
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
old
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
that
,
"
observed
Paul
,
rubbing
his
hands
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
very
good
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
did
n't
dare
to
ask
him
why
,
lest
she
should
receive
some
perfectly
annihilating
answer
.
<EOS>
But
as
a
compensation
to
her
wounded
feelings
,
she
harassed
Master
Bitherstone
to
that
extent
until
bed
-
time
,
that
he
began
that
very
night
to
make
arrangements
for
an
overland
return
to
India
,
by
Secreting
from
his
supper
a
quarter
of
a
round
of
bread
and
a
fragment
of
moist
Dutch
cheese
,
as
the
beginning
of
a
stock
of
provision
to
support
him
on
the
voyage
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
had
kept
watch
and
ward
over
little
Paul
and
his
sister
for
nearly
twelve
months
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
home
twice
,
but
only
for
a
few
days
;
and
had
been
constant
in
their
weekly
visits
to
Mr
Dombey
at
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
By
little
and
little
Paul
had
grown
stronger
,
and
had
become
able
to
dispense
with
his
carriage
;
though
he
still
looked
thin
and
delicate
;
and
still
remained
the
same
old
,
quiet
,
dreamy
child
that
he
had
been
when
first
consigned
to
Mrs
Pipchin
's
care
.
<EOS>
One
Saturday
afternoon
,
at
dusk
,
great
consternation
was
occasioned
in
the
castle
by
the
unlooked
-
for
announcement
of
Mr
Dombey
as
a
visitor
to
Mrs
Pipchin
.
<EOS>
The
population
of
the
parlour
was
immediately
swept
up
stairs
as
on
the
wings
of
a
whirlwind
,
and
after
much
slamming
of
bedroom
doors
,
and
trampling
overhead
,
and
some
knocking
about
of
Master
Bitherstone
by
Mrs
Pipchin
,
as
a
relief
to
the
perturbation
of
her
spirits
,
the
black
bombazeen
garments
of
the
worthy
old
lady
darkened
the
audience
-
chamber
where
Mr
Dombey
was
contemplating
the
vacant
arm
-
chair
of
his
son
and
heir
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Pipchin
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
How
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Pipchin
,
"
I
am
pretty
well
,
considering
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
always
used
that
form
of
words
.
<EOS>
It
meant
,
considering
her
virtues
,
sacrifices
,
and
so
forth
.

n't
expect
,
Sir
,
to
be
very
well
,
"
said
Mrs
Pipchin
,
taking
a
chair
and
fetching
her
breath
;
"
but
such
health
as
I
have
<EOS>
,
I
am
grateful
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
inclined
his
head
with
the
satisfied
air
of
a
patron
,
who
felt
that
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
for
which
he
paid
so
much
a
quarter
.
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
silence
he
went
on
to
say
:
  
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
,
I
have
taken
the
liberty
of
calling
,
to
consult
you
in
reference
to
my
son
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
it
in
my
mind
to
do
so
for
some
time
past
;
but
have
deferred
it
from
time
to
time
,
in
order
that
his
health
might
be
thoroughly
re
-
established
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
misgivings
on
that
subject
,
Mrs
Pipchin
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Brighton
has
proved
very
beneficial
,
Sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Pipchin
.
"
<EOS>
Very
beneficial
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
purpose
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
his
remaining
at
Brighton
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
rubbed
her
hands
,
and
bent
her
grey
eyes
on
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
pursued
Mr
Dombey
,
stretching
out
his
forefinger
,
"
but
possibly
that
he
should
now
make
a
change
,
and
lead
different
kind
of
life
here
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
Mrs
Pipchin
,
that
is
the
object
of
my
visit
.
<EOS>
My
son
is
getting
on
,
Mrs
Pipchin
.
<EOS>
Really
he
is
getting
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
melancholy
in
the
triumphant
air
with
which
Mr
Dombey
said
this
.
<EOS>
It
showed
how
long
Paul
's
childish
life
had
been
to
him
,
and
how
his
hopes
were
set
upon
a
later
stage
of
his
existence
.
<EOS>
Pity
may
appear
a
strange
word
to
connect
with
any
one
so
haughty
and
so
cold
,
and
yet
he
seemed
a
worthy
subject
for
it
at
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Six
years
old
!
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
settling
his
neckcloth
---
perhaps
to
hide
an
irrepressible
smile
that
rather
seemed
to
strike
upon
the
surface
of
his
face
and
glance
away
,
as
finding
no
resting
-
place
,
than
to
play
there
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
six
will
be
changed
to
sixteen
,
before
we
have
time
to
look
about
us
.
"
  
"
Ten
years
,
"
croaked
the
unsympathetic
Pipchin
,
with
a
frosty
glistening
of
her
hard
grey
eye
,
and
a
dreary
shaking
of
her
bent
head
,
"
is
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
depends
on
circumstances
,
"
returned
Mr
Dombey
;
"
at
all
events
,
Mrs
Pipchin
,
my
son
is
six
years
old
,
and
there
is
no
doubt
,
I
fear
,
that
in
his
studies
he
is
behind
many
children
of
his
age
---
or
his
youth
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
quickly
answering
what
he
mistrusted
was
a
shrewd
twinkle
of
the
frosty
eye
<EOS>
,
"
his
youth
is
a
more
appropriate
expression
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Mrs
Pipchin
,
instead
of
being
behind
his
peers
,
my
son
ought
to
be
before
them
;
far
before
them
.
<EOS>
There
is
an
eminence
ready
for
him
to
mount
upon
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
of
chance
or
doubt
in
the
course
before
my
son
.
<EOS>
His
way
in
life
was
clear
and
prepared
,
and
marked
out
before
he
existed
.
<EOS>
The
education
of
such
a
young
gentleman
must
not
be
delayed
.
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
left
imperfect
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
very
steadily
and
seriously
undertaken
,
Mrs
Pipchin
.
"
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Pipchin
,
"
I
can
say
nothing
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
quite
sure
,
Mrs
Pipchin
,
"
returned
Mr
Dombey
,
approvingly
,
"
that
a
person
of
your
good
sense
could
not
,
and
would
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
great
deal
of
nonsense
---
and
worse
---
<EOS>
talked
about
young
people
not
being
pressed
too
hard
at
first
,
and
being
tempted
on
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Pipchin
,
impatiently
rubbing
her
hooked
nose
.
<EOS>
"
It
never
was
thought
of
in
my
time
,
and
it
has
no
business
to
be
thought
of
now
.
<EOS>
My
opinion
is
"
keep'em
at
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
My
good
madam
,
"
returned
Mr
Dombey
,
"
you
have
not
acquired
your
reputation
undeservedly
;
and
I
beg
you
to
believe
,
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
,
that
I
am
more
than
satisfied
with
your
excellent
system
of
management
,
and
shall
have
the
greatest
pleasure
in
commending
it
whenever
my
poor
commendation
"
---
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
loftiness
when
he
affected
to
disparage
his
own
importance
,
passed
all
bounds
---
"
can
be
of
any
service
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
thinking
of
Doctor
Blimber
's
,
Mrs
Pipchin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
neighbour
,
Sir
?
"
said
Mrs
Pipchin
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
the
Doctor
's
is
an
excellent
establishment
.
<EOS>
I
've
heard
that
it
's
very
strictly
conducted
,
and
there
is
nothing
but
learning
going
on
from
morning
to
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
it
's
very
expensive
,
"
added
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
's
very
expensive
,
Sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Pipchin
,
catching
at
the
fact
,
as
if
in
omitting
that
,
she
had
omitted
one
of
its
leading
merits
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
some
communication
with
the
Doctor
,
Mrs
Pipchin
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
hitching
his
chair
anxiously
a
little
nearer
to
the
fire
,
"
and
he
does
not
consider
Paul
at
all
too
young
for
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
mentioned
several
instances
of
boys
in
Greek
at
about
the
same
age
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
any
little
uneasiness
in
my
own
mind
,
Mrs
Pipchin
,
on
the
subject
of
this
change
,
it
is
not
on
that
head
.
<EOS>
My
son
not
having
known
a
mother
has
gradually
concentrated
much
---
too
much
---
of
his
childish
affection
on
his
sister
.
<EOS>
Whether
their
separation
---
"
Mr
Dombey
said
no
more
,
but
sat
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hoity
-
toity
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Pipchin
,
shaking
out
her
black
bombazeen
skirts
,
and
plucking
up
all
the
ogress
within
her
.
<EOS>
"
If
she
do
n't
like
it
,
Mr
Dombey
,
she
must
be
taught
to
lump
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
good
lady
apologised
immediately
afterwards
for
using
so
common
a
figure
of
speech
,
but
said
(
and
truly
)
<EOS>
that
that
was
the
way
she
reasoned
with
'em
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
waited
until
Mrs
Pipchin
had
done
bridling
and
shaking
her
head
,
and
frowning
down
a
legion
of
Bitherstones
and
Pankeys
;
and
then
said
quietly
,
but
correctively
,
"
He
,
my
good
madam
,
he
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
's
system
would
have
applied
very
much
the
same
mode
of
cure
to
any
uneasiness
on
the
part
of
Paul
,
too
;
but
as
the
hard
grey
eye
was
sharp
enough
to
see
that
the
recipe
,
however
Mr
Dombey
might
admit
its
efficacy
in
the
case
of
the
daughter
,
was
not
a
sovereign
remedy
for
the
son
,
she
argued
the
point
;
and
contended
that
change
,
and
new
society
,
and
the
different
form
of
life
he
would
lead
at
Doctor
Blimber
's
,
and
the
studies
he
would
have
to
master
,
would
very
soon
prove
sufficient
alienations
.
<EOS>
As
this
chimed
in
with
Mr
Dombey
's
own
hope
and
belief
,
it
gave
that
gentleman
a
still
higher
opinion
of
Mrs
Pipchin
's
understanding
:
and
as
Mrs
Pipchin
,
at
the
same
time
,
bewailed
the
loss
of
her
dear
little
friend
(
which
was
not
an
overwhelming
shock
to
her
,
as
she
had
long
expected
it
,
and
had
not
looked
,
in
the
beginning
,
for
his
remaining
with
her
longer
than
three
months
)
,
he
formed
an
equally
good
opinion
of
Mrs
Pipchin
's
disinterestedness
.
<EOS>
It
was
plain
that
he
had
given
the
subject
anxious
consideration
,
for
he
had
formed
a
plan
,
which
he
announced
to
the
ogress
,
of
sending
Paul
to
the
Doctor
's
as
a
weekly
boarder
for
the
first
half
year
,
during
which
time
Florence
would
remain
at
the
castle
,
that
she
might
receive
her
brother
there
,
on
Saturdays
.
<EOS>
This
would
wean
him
by
degrees
,
Mr
Dombey
said
;
probably
with
a
recollection
of
his
not
having
been
weaned
by
degrees
on
a
former
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
finished
the
interview
by
expressing
his
hope
that
Mrs
Pipchin
would
still
remain
in
office
as
general
superintendent
and
overseer
of
his
son
,
pending
his
studies
at
Brighton
;
and
having
kissed
Paul
,
and
shaken
hands
with
Florence
,
and
beheld
Master
Bitherstone
in
his
collar
of
state
,
and
made
Miss
Pankey
cry
by
patting
her
on
the
head
(
in
which
region
she
was
uncommonly
tender
,
on
account
of
a
habit
Mrs
Pipchin
had
of
sounding
it
with
her
knuckles
,
like
a
cask
)
,
he
withdrew
to
his
hotel
and
dinner
:
resolved
that
Paul
,
now
that
he
was
getting
so
old
and
well
,
should
begin
a
vigorous
course
of
education
forthwith
,
to
qualify
him
for
the
position
in
which
he
was
to
shine
;
and
that
Doctor
Blimber
should
take
him
in
hand
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
Whenever
a
young
gentleman
was
taken
in
hand
by
Doctor
Blimber
,
he
might
consider
himself
sure
of
a
pretty
tight
squeeze
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
only
undertook
the
charge
of
ten
young
gentlemen
,
but
he
had
,
always
ready
,
a
supply
of
learning
for
a
hundred
,
on
the
lowest
estimate
;
and
it
was
at
once
the
business
and
delight
of
his
life
to
gorge
the
unhappy
ten
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
In
fact
,
Doctor
Blimber
's
establishment
was
a
great
hot
-
house
,
in
which
there
was
a
forcing
apparatus
incessantly
at
work
.
<EOS>
All
the
boys
blew
before
their
time
.
<EOS>
Mental
green
-
peas
were
produced
at
Christmas
,
and
intellectual
asparagus
all
the
year
round
.
<EOS>
Mathematical
gooseberries
(
very
sour
ones
too
)
were
common
at
untimely
seasons
,
and
from
mere
sprouts
of
bushes
,
under
Doctor
Blimber
's
cultivation
.
<EOS>
Every
description
of
Greek
and
Latin
vegetable
was
got
off
the
driest
twigs
of
boys
,
under
the
frostiest
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Nature
was
of
no
consequence
at
all
.
<EOS>
No
matter
what
a
young
gentleman
was
intended
to
bear
,
Doctor
Blimber
made
him
bear
to
pattern
,
somehow
or
other
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
all
very
pleasant
and
ingenious
,
but
the
system
of
forcing
was
attended
with
its
usual
disadvantages
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
the
right
taste
about
the
premature
productions
,
and
they
did
n't
keep
well
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
one
young
gentleman
,
with
a
swollen
nose
and
an
excessively
large
head
(
the
oldest
of
the
ten
who
had
"
gone
through
"
everything
)
,
suddenly
left
off
blowing
one
day
,
and
remained
in
the
establishment
a
mere
stalk
.
<EOS>
And
people
did
say
that
the
Doctor
had
rather
overdone
it
with
young
Toots
,
and
that
when
he
began
to
have
whiskers
he
left
off
having
brains
.
  
<EOS>
There
young
Toots
was
,
at
any
rate
;
possessed
of
the
gruffest
of
voices
and
the
shrillest
of
minds
;
sticking
ornamental
pins
into
his
shirt
,
and
keeping
a
ring
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
to
put
on
his
little
finger
by
stealth
,
when
the
pupils
went
out
walking
;
constantly
falling
in
love
by
sight
with
nurserymaids
,
who
had
no
idea
of
his
existence
;
and
looking
at
the
gas
-
lighted
world
over
the
little
iron
bars
in
the
left
-
hand
corner
window
of
the
front
three
pairs
of
stairs
,
after
bed
-
time
,
like
a
greatly
overgrown
cherub
who
had
sat
up
aloft
much
too
long
.
  
<EOS>
The
Doctor
was
a
portly
gentleman
in
a
suit
of
black
,
with
strings
at
his
knees
,
and
stockings
below
them
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
bald
head
,
highly
polished
;
a
deep
voice
;
and
a
chin
so
very
double
,
that
it
was
a
wonder
how
he
ever
managed
to
shave
into
the
creases
.
<EOS>
He
had
likewise
a
pair
of
little
eyes
that
were
always
half
shut
up
,
and
a
mouth
that
was
always
half
expanded
into
a
grin
,
as
if
he
had
,
that
moment
,
posed
a
boy
,
and
were
waiting
to
convict
him
from
his
own
lips
.
<EOS>
Insomuch
,
that
when
the
Doctor
put
his
right
hand
into
the
breast
of
his
coat
,
and
with
his
other
hand
behind
him
,
and
a
scarcely
perceptible
wag
of
his
head
,
made
the
commonest
observation
to
a
nervous
stranger
,
it
was
like
a
sentiment
from
the
sphynx
,
and
settled
his
business
.
  
<EOS>
The
Doctor
's
was
a
mighty
fine
house
,
fronting
the
sea
.
<EOS>
Not
a
joyful
style
of
house
within
,
but
quite
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
Sad
-
coloured
curtains
,
whose
proportions
were
spare
and
lean
,
hid
themselves
despondently
behind
the
windows
.
<EOS>
The
tables
and
chairs
were
put
away
in
rows
,
like
figures
in
a
sum
:
<EOS>
fires
were
so
rarely
lighted
in
the
rooms
of
ceremony
,
that
they
felt
like
wells
,
and
a
visitor
represented
the
bucket
;
the
dining
-
room
seemed
the
last
place
in
the
world
where
any
eating
or
drinking
was
likely
to
occur
;
there
was
no
sound
through
all
the
house
but
the
ticking
of
a
great
clock
in
the
hall
,
which
made
itself
audible
in
the
very
garrets
:
and
sometimes
a
dull
crying
of
young
gentlemen
at
their
lessons
,
like
the
murmurings
of
an
assemblage
of
melancholy
pigeons
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Blimber
,
too
,
although
a
slim
and
graceful
maid
,
did
no
soft
violence
to
the
gravity
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
light
nonsense
about
Miss
Blimber
.
<EOS>
She
kept
her
hair
short
and
crisp
,
and
wore
spectacles
.
<EOS>
She
was
dry
and
sandy
with
working
in
the
graves
of
deceased
languages
.
<EOS>
None
of
your
live
languages
for
Miss
Blimber
.
<EOS>
They
must
be
dead
<EOS>
---
stone
dead
---
and
then
Miss
Blimber
dug
them
up
like
a
Ghoul
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Blimber
,
her
mama
,
was
not
learned
herself
,
but
she
pretended
to
be
,
and
that
did
quite
as
well
.
<EOS>
She
said
at
evening
parties
,
that
if
she
could
have
known
Cicero
,
she
thought
she
could
have
died
contented
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
steady
joy
of
her
life
to
see
the
Doctor
's
young
gentlemen
go
out
walking
,
unlike
all
other
young
gentlemen
,
in
the
largest
possible
shirt
-
collars
,
and
the
stiffest
possible
cravats
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
classical
,
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
,
Doctor
Blimber
's
assistant
,
he
was
a
kind
of
human
barrel
-
organ
,
with
a
little
list
of
tunes
at
which
he
was
continually
working
,
over
and
over
again
,
without
any
variation
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
been
fitted
up
with
a
change
of
barrels
,
perhaps
,
in
early
life
,
if
his
destiny
had
been
favourable
;
but
it
had
not
been
;
and
he
had
only
one
,
with
which
,
in
a
monotonous
round
,
it
was
his
occupation
to
bewilder
the
young
ideas
of
Doctor
Blimber
's
young
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
The
young
gentlemen
were
prematurely
full
of
carking
anxieties
.
<EOS>
They
knew
no
rest
from
the
pursuit
of
stony
-
hearted
verbs
,
savage
noun
-
substantives
,
inflexible
syntactic
passages
,
and
ghosts
of
exercises
that
appeared
to
them
in
their
dreams
.
<EOS>
Under
the
forcing
system
,
a
young
gentleman
usually
took
leave
of
his
spirits
in
three
weeks
.
<EOS>
He
had
all
the
cares
of
the
world
on
his
head
in
three
months
.
<EOS>
He
conceived
bitter
sentiments
against
his
parents
or
guardians
in
four
;
he
was
an
old
misanthrope
,
in
five
;
envied
Curtius
that
blessed
refuge
in
the
earth
,
in
six
;
and
at
the
end
of
the
first
twelvemonth
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
,
from
which
he
never
afterwards
departed
,
that
all
the
fancies
of
the
poets
,
and
lessons
of
the
sages
,
were
a
mere
collection
of
words
and
grammar
,
and
had
no
other
meaning
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
went
on
blow
,
blow
,
blowing
,
in
the
Doctor
's
hot
-
house
,
all
the
time
;
and
the
Doctor
's
glory
and
reputation
were
great
,
when
he
took
his
wintry
growth
home
to
his
relations
and
friends
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
the
Doctor
's
door
-
steps
one
day
,
Paul
stood
with
a
fluttering
heart
,
and
with
his
small
right
hand
in
his
father
's
.
<EOS>
His
other
hand
was
locked
in
that
of
Florence
.
<EOS>
How
tight
the
tiny
pressure
of
that
one
;
and
how
loose
and
cold
the
other
!
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Pinchin
hovered
behind
the
victim
,
with
her
sable
plumage
and
her
hooked
beak
,
like
a
bird
of
ill
-
omen
.
<EOS>
She
was
out
of
breath
---
for
Mr
Dombey
,
full
of
great
thoughts
,
had
walked
fast
---
and
she
croaked
hoarsely
as
she
waited
for
the
opening
of
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Paul
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
exultingly
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
way
indeed
to
be
Dombey
and
Son
,
and
have
money
.
<EOS>
You
are
almost
a
man
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Almost
,
"
returned
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
Even
his
childish
agitation
could
not
master
the
sly
and
quaint
yet
touching
look
,
with
which
he
accompanied
the
reply
.
  
<EOS>
It
brought
a
vague
expression
of
dissatisfaction
into
Mr
Dombey
's
face
;
but
the
door
being
opened
,
it
was
quickly
gone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Blimber
is
at
home
,
I
believe
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
The
man
said
yes
;
and
as
they
passed
in
,
looked
at
Paul
as
if
he
were
a
little
mouse
,
and
the
house
were
a
trap
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
weak
-
eyed
young
man
,
with
the
first
faint
streaks
or
early
dawn
of
a
grin
on
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
It
was
mere
imbecility
;
but
Mrs
Pipchin
took
it
into
her
head
that
it
was
impudence
,
and
made
a
snap
at
him
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
laugh
behind
the
gentleman
's
back
?
"
said
Mrs
Pipchin
.
"
<EOS>
And
what
do
you
take
me
for
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
a
laughing
at
nobody
,
and
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
take
you
for
nothing
,
Ma'am
,
"
returned
the
young
man
,
in
consternation
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
pack
of
idle
dogs
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs
Pipchin
,
"
only
fit
to
be
turnspits
.
<EOS>
Go
and
tell
your
master
that
Mr
Dombey
's
here
,
or
it
'll
be
worse
for
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
weak
-
eyed
young
man
went
,
very
meekly
,
to
discharge
himself
of
this
commission
;
and
soon
came
back
to
invite
them
to
the
Doctor
's
study
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
laughing
again
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Pipchin
,
when
it
came
to
her
turn
,
bringing
up
the
rear
,
to
pass
him
in
the
hall
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
,
returned
the
young
man
,
grievously
oppressed
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
such
a
thing
as
this
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
,
Mrs
Pipchin
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
looking
round
.
"
<EOS>
Softly
!
<EOS>
Pray
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
,
in
her
deference
,
merely
muttered
at
the
young
man
as
she
passed
on
,
and
said
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
he
was
a
precious
fellow
"
---
leaving
the
young
man
,
who
was
all
meekness
and
incapacity
,
affected
even
to
tears
by
the
incident
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Pipchin
had
a
way
of
falling
foul
of
all
meek
people
;
and
her
friends
said
who
could
wonder
at
it
,
after
the
Peruvian
mines
!
  
<EOS>
The
Doctor
was
sitting
in
his
portentous
study
,
with
a
globe
at
each
knee
,
books
all
round
him
,
Homer
over
the
door
,
and
Minerva
on
the
mantel
-
shelf
.
"
<EOS>
And
how
do
you
do
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
to
Mr
Dombey
;
"
and
how
is
my
little
friend
?
"
<EOS>
Grave
as
an
organ
was
the
Doctor
's
speech
;
and
when
he
ceased
,
the
great
clock
in
the
hall
seemed
(
to
Paul
at
least
)
to
take
him
up
,
and
to
go
on
saying
,
"
how
,
is
,
my
,
lit
,
tle
,
friend
?
<EOS>
how
,
is
,
my
,
lit
,
tle
,
friend
?
"
<EOS>
over
and
over
and
over
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
little
friend
being
something
too
small
to
be
seen
at
all
from
where
the
Doctor
sat
,
over
the
books
on
his
table
,
the
Doctor
made
several
futile
attempts
to
get
a
view
of
him
round
the
legs
;
which
Mr
Dombey
perceiving
,
relieved
the
Doctor
from
his
embarrassment
by
taking
Paul
up
in
his
arms
,
and
sitting
him
on
another
little
table
,
over
against
the
Doctor
,
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
said
the
Doctor
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
his
hand
in
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
I
see
my
little
friend
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
,
my
little
friend
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
clock
in
the
hall
would
n't
subscribe
to
this
alteration
in
the
form
of
words
,
but
continued
to
repeat
"
how
,
is
,
my
,
lit
,
tle
,
friend
?
<EOS>
how
,
is
,
my
,
lit
,
tle
,
friend
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
I
thank
you
,
Sir
,
"
returned
Paul
,
answering
the
clock
quite
as
much
as
the
Doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
said
Doctor
Blimber
.
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
make
a
man
of
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
,
Paul
?
"
added
Mr
Dombey
;
<EOS>
Paul
being
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
make
a
man
of
him
?
"
repeated
the
Doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
rather
be
a
child
,
"
replied
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
said
the
Doctor
.
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
child
sat
on
the
table
looking
at
him
,
with
a
curious
expression
of
suppressed
emotion
in
his
face
,
and
beating
one
hand
proudly
on
his
knee
as
if
he
had
the
rising
tears
beneath
it
,
and
crushed
them
.
<EOS>
But
his
other
hand
strayed
a
little
way
the
while
,
a
little
farther
---
farther
from
him
yet
---
until
it
lighted
on
the
neck
of
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
why
,
"
it
seemed
to
say
,
and
then
the
steady
look
was
broken
up
and
gone
;
the
working
lip
was
loosened
;
and
the
tears
came
streaming
forth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Pipchin
,
"
said
his
father
,
in
a
querulous
manner
,
"
I
am
really
very
sorry
to
see
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
away
from
him
,
do
,
Miss
Dombey
,
"
quoth
the
matron
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
blandly
nodding
his
head
,
to
keep
Mrs
Pipchin
back
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ne
-
ver
mind
<EOS>
;
we
shall
substitute
new
cares
and
new
impressions
,
Mr
Dombey
,
very
shortly
.
<EOS>
You
would
still
wish
my
little
friend
to
acquire
"
  
"
Everything
,
if
you
please
,
Doctor
,
"
returned
Mr
Dombey
,
firmly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
who
,
with
his
half
-
shut
eyes
,
and
his
usual
smile
,
seemed
to
survey
Paul
with
the
sort
of
interest
that
might
attach
to
some
choice
little
animal
he
was
going
to
stuff
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
exactly
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
We
shall
impart
a
great
variety
of
information
to
our
little
friend
,
and
bring
him
quickly
forward
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
Quite
a
virgin
soil
,
I
believe
you
said
,
Mr
Dombey
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Except
some
ordinary
preparation
at
home
,
and
from
this
lady
,
"
replied
Mr
Dombey
,
introducing
Mrs
Pipchin
,
who
instantly
communicated
a
rigidity
to
her
whole
muscular
system
,
and
snorted
defiance
beforehand
,
in
case
the
Doctor
should
disparage
her
;
"
except
so
far
,
Paul
has
,
as
yet
,
applied
himself
to
no
studies
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
Doctor
Blimber
inclined
his
head
,
in
gentle
tolerance
of
such
insignificant
poaching
as
Mrs
Pipchin
's
,
and
said
he
was
glad
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
much
more
satisfactory
,
he
observed
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
to
begin
at
the
foundation
.
<EOS>
And
again
he
leered
at
Paul
,
as
if
he
would
have
liked
to
tackle
him
with
the
Greek
alphabet
on
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
circumstance
,
indeed
,
Doctor
Blimber
,
"
pursued
Mr
Dombey
,
glancing
at
his
little
son
,
"
and
the
interview
I
have
already
had
the
pleasure
of
holding
with
you
,
renders
any
further
explanation
,
and
consequently
,
and
further
intrusion
on
your
valuable
time
,
so
unnecessary
,
that
---
"
   
"
Now
,
Miss
Dombey
!
"
said
the
acid
Pipchin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Permit
me
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
"
one
moment
.
<EOS>
Allow
me
to
present
Mrs
Blimber
and
my
daughter
,
who
will
be
associated
with
the
domestic
life
of
our
young
Pilgrim
to
Parnassus
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Blimber
,
"
for
the
lady
,
who
had
perhaps
been
in
waiting
,
opportunely
entered
,
followed
by
her
daughter
,
that
fair
Sexton
in
spectacles
,
"
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
Cornelia
,
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
my
love
,
"
pursued
the
Doctor
,
turning
to
his
wife
,
"
is
so
confiding
as
to
---
do
you
see
our
little
friend
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Blimber
,
in
an
excess
of
politeness
,
of
which
Mr
Dombey
was
the
object
,
apparently
did
not
,
for
she
was
backing
against
the
little
friend
,
and
very
much
endangering
his
position
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
But
,
on
this
hint
,
she
turned
to
admire
his
classical
and
intellectual
lineaments
,
and
turning
again
to
Mr
Dombey
,
said
,
with
a
sigh
,
that
she
envied
his
dear
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
Like
a
bee
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Blimber
,
with
uplifted
eyes
,
"
about
to
plunge
into
a
garden
of
the
choicest
flowers
,
and
sip
the
sweets
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
Virgil
,
Horace
,
Ovid
,
Terence
,
Plautus
,
Cicero
.
<EOS>
What
a
world
of
honey
have
we
here
.
<EOS>
It
may
appear
remarkable
,
Mr
Dombey
,
in
one
who
is
a
wife
---
the
wife
of
such
a
husband
---
"
  
"
Hush
,
hush
,
"
said
Doctor
Blimber
.
<EOS>
"
Fie
for
shame
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dombey
will
forgive
the
partiality
of
a
wife
,
"
said
Mrs
Blimber
,
with
an
engaging
smile
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
answered
"
Not
at
all
:
"
applying
those
words
,
it
is
to
be
presumed
,
to
the
partiality
,
and
not
to
the
forgiveness
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
And
it
may
seem
remarkable
in
one
who
is
a
mother
also
,
"
resumed
Mrs
Blimber
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
such
a
mother
,
"
observed
Mr
Dombey
,
bowing
with
some
confused
idea
of
being
complimentary
to
Cornelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
really
,
"
pursued
Mrs
Blimber
,
"
I
think
if
I
could
have
known
Cicero
,
and
been
his
friend
,
and
talked
with
him
in
his
retirement
at
Tusculum
(
beautiful
Tusculum
!
)
,
I
could
have
died
contented
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
learned
enthusiasm
is
so
very
contagious
,
that
Mr
Dombey
half
believed
this
was
exactly
his
case
;
and
even
Mrs
Pipchin
,
who
was
not
,
as
we
have
seen
,
of
an
accommodating
disposition
generally
,
gave
utterance
to
a
little
sound
between
a
groan
and
a
sigh
,
as
if
she
would
have
said
that
nobody
but
Cicero
could
have
proved
a
lasting
consolation
under
that
failure
of
the
Peruvian
Mines
,
but
that
he
indeed
would
have
been
a
very
Davy
-
lamp
of
refuge
.
  
<EOS>
Cornelia
looked
at
Mr
Dombey
through
her
spectacles
,
as
if
she
would
have
liked
to
crack
a
few
quotations
with
him
from
the
authority
in
question
.
<EOS>
But
this
design
,
if
she
entertained
it
,
was
frustrated
by
a
knock
at
the
room
-
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
that
?
"
said
the
Doctor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
Come
in
,
Toots
:
come
in
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
Toots
bowed
.
<EOS>
"
Quite
a
coincidence
!
"
said
Doctor
Blimber
.
<EOS>
"
Here
we
have
the
beginning
and
the
end
.
<EOS>
Alpha
and
Omega
.
<EOS>
Our
head
boy
,
Mr
Dombey
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Doctor
might
have
called
him
their
head
and
shoulders
boy
,
for
he
was
at
least
that
much
taller
than
any
of
the
rest
.
<EOS>
He
blushed
very
much
at
finding
himself
among
strangers
,
and
chuckled
aloud
.
  
<EOS>
"
An
addition
to
our
little
Portico
,
Toots
,
"
said
the
Doctor
;
"
Mr
Dombey
's
son
.
"
  
<EOS>
Young
Toots
blushed
again
:
and
finding
,
from
a
solemn
silence
which
prevailed
that
he
was
expected
to
say
something
,
said
to
Paul
,
"
How
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
in
a
voice
so
deep
,
and
a
manner
so
sheepish
,
that
if
a
lamb
had
roared
it
could
n't
have
been
more
surprising
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
Mr
Feeder
,
if
you
please
,
Toots
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
"
to
prepare
a
few
introductory
volumes
for
Mr
Dombey
's
Son
,
and
to
allot
him
a
convenient
seat
for
study
.
<EOS>
My
dear
,
I
believe
Mr
Dombey
has
not
seen
the
dormitories
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
Mr
Dombey
will
walk
up
stairs
,
"
said
Mrs
Blimber
,
"
I
shall
be
more
than
proud
to
show
him
the
dominions
of
the
drowsy
god
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
Mrs
Blimber
,
who
was
a
lady
of
great
suavity
,
and
a
wiry
figure
,
and
who
wore
a
cap
composed
of
sky
-
blue
materials
,
proceeded
up
stairs
with
Mr
Dombey
and
Cornelia
;
Mrs
Pipchin
following
,
and
looking
out
sharp
for
her
enemy
the
footman
.
  
<EOS>
While
they
were
gone
,
Paul
sat
upon
the
table
,
holding
Florence
by
the
hand
,
and
glancing
timidly
from
the
Doctor
round
and
round
the
room
,
while
the
Doctor
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
with
his
hand
in
his
breast
as
usual
,
held
a
book
from
him
at
arm
's
length
,
and
read
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
very
awful
in
this
manner
of
reading
.
<EOS>
It
was
such
a
determined
,
unimpassioned
,
inflexible
,
coldblooded
way
of
going
to
work
.
<EOS>
It
left
the
Doctor
's
countenance
exposed
to
view
;
and
when
the
Doctor
smiled
auspiciously
at
his
author
,
or
knit
his
brows
,
or
shook
his
head
and
made
wry
faces
at
him
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
Do
n't
tell
me
,
Sir
;
I
know
better
,
"
it
was
terrific
.
  
<EOS>
Toots
,
too
,
had
no
business
to
be
outside
the
door
,
ostentatiously
examining
the
wheels
in
his
watch
,
and
counting
his
half
-
crowns
.
<EOS>
But
that
did
n't
last
long
;
for
Doctor
Blimber
,
happening
to
change
the
position
of
his
tight
plump
legs
,
as
if
he
were
going
to
get
up
,
Toots
swiftly
vanished
,
and
appeared
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
and
his
conductress
were
soon
heard
coming
down
stairs
again
,
talking
all
the
way
;
and
presently
they
reentered
the
Doctor
's
study
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Mr
Dombey
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
laying
down
his
book
,
"
that
the
arrangements
meet
your
approval
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
excellent
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
fair
,
indeed
,
"
said
Mrs
Pipchin
,
in
a
low
voice
;
never
disposed
to
give
too
much
encouragement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Pipchin
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
wheeling
round
,
"
will
,
with
your
permission
,
Doctor
and
Mrs
Blimber
,
visit
Paul
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whenever
Mrs
Pipchin
pleases
,
"
observed
the
Doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Always
happy
to
see
her
,
"
said
Mrs
Blimber
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
I
have
given
all
the
trouble
I
need
,
and
may
take
my
leave
.
<EOS>
Paul
,
my
child
,
"
he
went
close
to
him
,
as
he
sat
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
Papa
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
limp
and
careless
little
hand
that
Mr
Dombey
took
in
his
,
was
singularly
out
of
keeping
with
the
wistful
face
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
no
part
in
its
sorrowful
expression
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
addressed
to
him
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
.
<EOS>
To
Florence
---
all
to
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
If
Mr
Dombey
in
his
insolence
of
wealth
,
had
ever
made
an
enemy
,
hard
to
appease
and
cruelly
vindictive
in
his
hate
,
even
such
an
enemy
might
have
received
the
pang
that
wrung
his
proud
heart
then
,
as
compensation
for
his
injury
.
   
<EOS>
He
bent
down
over
his
boy
,
and
kissed
him
.
<EOS>
If
his
sight
were
dimmed
as
he
did
so
,
by
something
that
for
a
moment
blurred
the
little
face
,
and
made
it
indistinct
to
him
,
his
mental
vision
may
have
been
,
for
that
short
time
,
the
clearer
perhaps
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
see
you
soon
,
Paul
.
<EOS>
You
are
free
on
Saturdays
and
Sundays
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
papa
,
"
returned
Paul
:
looking
at
his
sister
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
Saturdays
and
Sundays
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
'll
try
and
learn
a
great
deal
here
,
and
be
a
clever
man
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
;
"
wo
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
try
,
"
returned
the
child
wearily
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
'll
soon
be
grown
up
now
!
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
very
soon
!
"
replied
the
child
.
<EOS>
Once
more
the
old
,
old
look
passed
rapidly
across
his
features
like
a
strange
light
.
<EOS>
It
fell
on
Mrs
Pipchin
,
and
extinguished
itself
in
her
black
dress
.
<EOS>
That
excellent
ogress
stepped
forward
to
take
leave
and
to
bear
off
Florence
,
which
she
had
long
been
thirsting
to
do
.
<EOS>
The
move
on
her
part
roused
Mr
Dombey
,
whose
eyes
were
fixed
on
Paul
.
<EOS>
After
patting
him
on
the
head
,
and
pressing
his
small
hand
again
,
he
took
leave
of
Doctor
Blimber
,
Mrs
Blimber
,
and
Miss
Blimber
,
with
his
usual
polite
frigidity
,
and
walked
out
of
the
study
.
  
<EOS>
Despite
his
entreaty
that
they
would
not
think
of
stirring
,
Doctor
Blimber
,
Mrs
Blimber
,
and
Miss
Blimber
all
pressed
forward
to
attend
him
to
the
hall
;
and
thus
Mrs
Pipchin
got
into
a
state
of
entanglement
with
Miss
Blimber
and
the
Doctor
,
and
was
crowded
out
of
the
study
before
she
could
clutch
Florence
.
<EOS>
To
which
happy
accident
<EOS>
Paul
stood
afterwards
indebted
for
the
dear
remembrance
,
that
Florence
ran
back
to
throw
her
arms
round
his
neck
,
and
that
hers
was
the
last
face
in
the
doorway
:
turned
towards
him
with
a
smile
of
encouragement
,
the
brighter
for
the
tears
through
which
it
beamed
.
  
<EOS>
It
made
his
childish
bosom
heave
and
swell
when
it
was
gone
;
and
sent
the
globes
,
the
books
,
blind
Homer
and
Minerva
,
swimming
round
the
room
.
<EOS>
But
they
stopped
,
all
of
a
sudden
;
and
then
he
heard
the
loud
clock
in
the
hall
still
gravely
inquiring
"
how
,
is
,
my
,
lit
,
tle
,
friend
?
<EOS>
how
,
is
,
my
,
lit
,
tle
,
friend
?
<EOS>
"
as
it
had
done
before
.
  
<EOS>
He
sat
,
with
folded
hands
,
upon
his
pedestal
,
silently
listening
.
<EOS>
But
he
might
have
answered
"
weary
,
weary
!
<EOS>
very
lonely
,
very
sad
!
"
<EOS>
And
there
,
with
an
aching
void
in
his
young
heart
,
and
all
outside
so
cold
,
and
bare
,
and
strange
,
Paul
sat
as
if
he
had
taken
life
unfurnished
,
and
the
upholsterer
were
never
coming
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
12
.
<EOS>
Paul
's
Education
 
<EOS>
AFTER
the
lapse
of
some
minutes
,
which
appeared
an
immense
time
to
little
Paul
Dombey
on
the
table
,
Doctor
Blimber
came
back
.
<EOS>
The
Doctor
's
walk
was
stately
,
and
calculated
to
impress
the
juvenile
mind
with
solemn
feelings
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
sort
of
march
;
but
when
the
Doctor
put
out
his
right
foot
,
he
gravely
turned
upon
his
axis
,
with
a
semi
-
circular
sweep
towards
the
left
;
and
when
he
put
out
his
left
foot
,
he
turned
in
the
same
manner
towards
the
right
.
<EOS>
So
that
he
seemed
,
at
every
stride
he
took
,
to
look
about
him
as
though
he
were
saying
,
"
Can
anybody
have
the
goodness
to
indicate
any
subject
,
in
any
direction
,
on
which
I
am
uninformed
?
<EOS>
I
rather
think
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Blimber
and
Miss
Blimber
came
back
in
the
Doctor
's
company
;
and
the
Doctor
,
lifting
his
new
pupil
off
the
table
,
delivered
him
over
to
Miss
Blimber
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cornelia
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
"
Dombey
will
be
your
charge
at
first
.
<EOS>
Bring
him
on
,
Cornelia
,
bring
him
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Blimber
received
her
young
ward
from
the
Doctor
's
hands
;
and
Paul
,
feeling
that
the
spectacles
were
surveying
him
,
cast
down
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
old
are
you
,
Dombey
?
"
said
Miss
Blimber
.
  
<EOS>
"
Six
,
"
answered
Paul
,
wondering
,
as
he
stole
a
glance
at
the
young
lady
,
why
her
hair
did
n't
grow
long
like
Florence
's
,
and
why
she
was
like
a
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
much
do
you
know
of
your
Latin
Grammmar
,
Dombey
?
"
said
Miss
Blimber
.
  
<EOS>
"
None
of
it
,
"
answered
Paul
.
<EOS>
Feeling
that
the
answer
was
a
shock
to
Miss
Blimber
's
sensibility
,
he
looked
up
at
the
three
faces
that
were
looking
down
at
him
,
and
said
:
  
"
I
hav'n't
been
well
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
a
weak
child
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
learn
a
Latin
Grammar
when
I
was
out
,
every
day
,
with
old
Glubb
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
'd
tell
old
Glubb
to
come
and
see
me
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
dreadful
low
name
!
"
said
Mrs
Blimber
.
<EOS>
"
Unclassical
to
a
degree
!
<EOS>
Who
is
the
monster
,
child
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
monster
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
Glubb
,
"
said
Mrs
Blimber
,
with
a
great
disrelish
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
no
more
a
monster
than
you
are
,
"
returned
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
cried
the
Doctor
,
in
a
terrible
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Aye
,
aye
,
aye
?
<EOS>
Aha
!
<EOS>
What
's
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Paul
was
dreadful
frightened
;
but
still
he
made
a
stand
for
the
absent
Glubb
,
though
he
did
it
trembling
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
very
nice
old
man
,
Ma'am
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
used
to
draw
my
couch
.
<EOS>
He
knows
all
about
the
deep
sea
,
and
the
fish
that
are
in
it
,
and
the
great
monsters
that
come
and
lie
on
rocks
in
the
sun
,
and
dive
into
the
water
again
when
they
're
startled
,
blowing
and
splashing
so
,
that
they
can
be
heard
for
miles
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
creatures
,
"
said
Paul
,
warming
with
his
subject
,
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
many
yards
long
,
and
I
forget
their
names
,
but
Florence
knows
,
that
pretend
to
be
in
distress
;
and
when
a
man
goes
near
them
,
out
of
compassion
,
they
open
their
great
jaws
,
and
attack
him
.
<EOS>
But
all
he
has
got
to
do
,
"
said
Paul
,
boldly
tendering
this
information
to
the
very
Doctor
himself
,
"
is
to
keep
on
turning
as
he
runs
away
,
and
then
,
as
they
turn
slowly
,
because
they
are
so
long
,
and
ca
n't
bend
,
he
's
sure
to
beat
them
.
<EOS>
And
though
old
Glubb
do
n't
know
why
the
sea
should
make
me
think
of
my
Mama
<EOS>
that
's
dead
,
or
what
it
is
that
it
is
always
saying
---
always
saying
!
<EOS>
he
knows
a
great
deal
about
it
.
<EOS>
And
I
wish
,
"
the
child
concluded
with
a
sudden
falling
of
his
countenance
,
and
failing
in
his
animation
,
as
he
looked
like
one
forlorn
,
upon
the
three
strange
face
,
"
that
you
'd
let
old
Glubb
come
here
to
see
me
,
for
I
know
him
very
well
,
and
he
knows
me
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
said
the
Doctor
,
shaking
his
head
:
"
this
is
bad
,
but
study
will
do
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Blimber
opined
,
with
something
like
a
shiver
,
that
he
was
an
unaccountable
child
;
and
,
allowing
for
the
difference
of
visage
,
looked
at
him
pretty
much
as
Mrs
Pipchin
had
been
used
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
him
round
the
house
,
Cornelia
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
"
and
familiarise
him
with
his
new
sphere
.
<EOS>
Go
with
that
young
lady
,
Dombey
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dombey
obeyed
;
giving
his
hand
to
the
abstruse
Cornelia
,
and
looking
at
her
sideways
,
with
timid
curiosity
,
as
they
went
away
together
.
<EOS>
For
her
spectacles
,
by
reason
of
the
glistening
of
the
glasses
,
made
her
so
mysterious
,
that
he
did
n't
know
where
she
was
looking
,
and
was
not
indeed
quite
sure
that
she
had
any
eyes
at
all
behind
them
.
  
<EOS>
Cornelia
took
him
first
to
the
schoolroom
,
which
was
situated
at
the
back
of
the
hall
,
and
was
approached
through
two
baize
doors
,
which
deadened
and
muffled
the
young
gentlemen
's
voices
.
<EOS>
Here
,
there
were
eight
young
gentlemen
in
various
stages
of
mental
prostration
,
all
very
hard
at
work
,
and
very
grave
indeed
.
<EOS>
Toots
,
as
an
old
hand
,
had
a
desk
to
himself
in
one
corner
:
and
a
magnificent
man
,
of
immense
age
,
he
looked
,
in
Paul
's
young
eyes
,
behind
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
,
who
sat
at
another
little
desk
,
had
his
Virgil
stop
on
,
and
was
slowly
grinding
that
tune
to
four
young
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
Of
the
remaining
four
,
two
who
grasped
their
foreheads
convulsively
,
were
engaged
in
solving
mathematical
problems
;
one
with
his
face
like
a
dirty
window
,
from
much
crying
,
was
endeavouring
to
flounder
through
a
hopeless
number
of
lines
before
dinner
;
and
one
sat
looking
at
his
task
in
stony
stupefaction
and
despair
---
which
it
seemed
had
been
his
condition
ever
since
breakfast
time
.
  
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
a
new
boy
did
not
create
the
sensation
that
might
have
been
expected
.
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
(
who
was
in
the
habit
of
shaving
his
head
for
coolness
,
and
had
nothing
but
little
bristles
on
it
)
,
gave
him
a
bony
hand
,
and
told
him
he
was
glad
to
see
him
---
which
Paul
would
have
been
very
glad
to
have
told
him
,
if
he
could
have
done
so
with
the
least
sincerity
.
<EOS>
Then
Paul
,
instructed
by
Cornelia
,
shook
hands
with
the
four
young
gentlemen
at
Mr
Feeder
's
desk
;
then
with
the
two
young
gentlemen
at
work
on
the
problems
,
who
were
very
feverish
;
then
with
the
gentleman
at
work
against
time
,
who
was
very
inky
;
and
lastly
with
the
young
gentleman
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
,
who
was
flabby
and
quite
cold
.
  
<EOS>
Paul
having
been
already
introduced
to
Toots
,
that
pupil
merely
chuckled
and
breathed
hard
,
as
his
custom
was
,
and
pursued
the
occupation
in
which
he
was
engaged
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
severe
one
;
for
on
account
of
his
having
"
gone
through
"
so
much
(
in
more
senses
than
one
)
,
and
also
of
his
having
,
as
before
hinted
,
left
off
blowing
in
his
prime
,
Toots
now
had
licence
to
pursue
his
own
course
of
study
:
which
was
chiefly
to
write
long
letters
to
himself
from
persons
of
distinction
,
addressed
"
P
Toots
,
Esquire
,
Brighton
,
Sussex
,
"
and
to
preserve
them
in
his
desk
with
great
care
.
  
<EOS>
These
ceremonies
passed
,
Cornelia
led
Paul
up
stairs
to
the
top
of
the
house
;
which
was
rather
a
slow
journey
,
on
account
of
Paul
being
obliged
to
land
both
feet
on
every
stair
,
before
he
mounted
another
.
<EOS>
But
they
reached
their
journey
's
end
at
last
;
and
there
,
in
a
front
room
,
looking
over
the
wild
sea
,
Cornelia
showed
him
a
nice
little
bed
with
white
hangings
,
close
to
the
window
,
on
which
there
was
already
beautifully
written
on
a
card
in
round
text
---
down
strokes
very
thick
,
and
up
strokes
very
fine
---
DOMBEY
;
while
two
other
little
bed
-
steads
in
the
same
room
were
announced
,
through
like
means
,
as
respectively
appertaining
unto
BRIGGS
and
TOZER
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
they
got
down
stairs
again
into
the
hall
,
Paul
saw
the
weak
-
eyed
young
man
who
had
given
that
mortal
offence
to
Mrs
Pipchin
,
suddenly
seize
a
very
large
drumstick
,
and
fly
at
a
gong
that
was
hanging
up
,
as
if
he
had
gone
mad
,
or
wanted
vengeance
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
receiving
warning
,
however
,
or
being
instantly
taken
into
custody
,
the
young
man
left
off
unchecked
,
after
having
made
a
dreadful
noise
.
<EOS>
Then
Cornelia
Blimber
said
to
Dombey
that
dinner
would
be
ready
in
a
quarter
of
an
your
,
and
perhaps
he
had
better
go
into
the
schoolroom
among
his
"
friends
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
Dombey
,
deferentially
passing
the
great
clock
which
was
still
as
anxious
as
ever
to
know
how
he
found
himself
,
opened
the
schoolroom
door
a
very
little
way
,
and
strayed
in
like
a
lost
boy
:
shutting
it
after
him
with
some
difficulty
.
<EOS>
His
friends
were
all
dispersed
about
the
room
except
the
stony
friend
,
who
remained
immoveable
.
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
was
stretching
himself
in
his
grey
gown
,
as
if
,
regardless
of
expense
,
he
were
resolved
to
pull
the
sleeves
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
Heigh
ho
hum
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Feeder
,
shaking
himself
like
a
cart
-
horse
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
me
,
dear
me
!
<EOS>
Ya
-
a
-
a
-
ah
!
"
  
<EOS>
Paul
was
quite
alarmed
by
Mr
Feeder
's
yawning
;
it
was
done
on
such
a
great
scale
,
and
he
was
so
terribly
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
All
the
boys
too
(
Toots
excepted
)
seemed
knocked
up
,
and
were
getting
ready
for
dinner
---
some
newly
tying
their
neck
-
cloths
,
which
were
very
stiff
indeed
;
and
others
washing
their
hands
or
brushing
their
hair
,
in
an
adjoining
ante
-
chamber
---
as
if
they
did
n't
think
they
should
enjoy
it
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
Young
Toots
who
was
ready
beforehand
,
and
had
therefore
nothing
to
do
,
and
had
leisure
to
bestow
upon
Paul
,
said
,
with
heavy
good
nature
:
  
"
Sit
down
,
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Sir
,
"
said
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
His
endeavouring
to
hoist
himself
on
to
a
very
high
window
-
seat
,
and
his
slipping
down
again
,
appeared
to
prepare
Toots
's
mind
for
the
reception
of
a
discovery
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
very
small
chap
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Sir
,
I
'm
small
,
"
returned
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
Toots
had
lifted
him
into
the
seat
,
and
done
it
kindly
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
your
tailor
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Toots
,
after
looking
at
him
for
some
moments
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
woman
that
has
made
my
clothes
as
yet
,
"
said
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
My
sister
's
dressmaker
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
tailor
's
Burgess
and
Co.
,
"
said
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fash'nable
.
<EOS>
But
very
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Paul
had
wit
enough
to
shake
his
head
,
as
if
he
would
have
said
it
was
easy
to
see
that
;
and
indeed
he
thought
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
father
's
regularly
rich
,
ai
n't
he
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Sir
,
"
said
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
Dombey
and
Son
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
which
?
"
demanded
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
Son
,
Sir
?
"
replied
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
made
one
or
two
attempts
,
in
a
low
voice
,
to
fix
the
firm
in
his
mind
;
but
not
quite
succeeding
,
said
he
would
get
Paul
to
mention
the
name
again
to
-
morrow
morning
,
as
it
was
rather
important
.
<EOS>
And
indeed
he
purposed
nothing
less
than
writing
himself
a
private
and
confidential
letter
from
Dombey
and
Son
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
other
pupils
(
always
excepting
the
stony
boy
)
gathered
round
.
<EOS>
They
were
polite
,
but
pale
;
and
spoke
low
;
and
they
were
so
depressed
in
their
spirits
,
that
in
comparison
with
the
general
tone
of
that
company
,
Master
Bitherstone
was
a
perfect
Miller
,
or
complete
Jest
Book
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
had
a
sense
of
injury
upon
him
,
too
,
had
Bitherstone
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
sleep
in
my
room
,
do
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
a
solemn
young
gentleman
,
whose
shirt
-
collar
curled
up
the
lobes
of
his
ears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Master
Briggs
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tozer
,
"
said
the
young
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
Paul
answered
yes
;
and
Tozer
pointing
out
the
stony
pupil
,
said
that
was
Briggs
.
<EOS>
Paul
had
already
felt
certain
that
it
must
be
either
Briggs
or
Tozer
,
though
he
did
n't
know
why
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
yours
a
strong
constitution
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Tozer
.
  
<EOS>
Paul
said
he
thought
not
.
<EOS>
Tozer
replied
that
he
thought
not
also
judging
from
Paul
's
looks
,
and
that
it
was
a
pity
,
for
it
need
be
.
<EOS>
He
then
asked
Paul
if
he
were
going
to
begin
with
Cornelia
;
and
on
Paul
saying
"
Yes
,
"
all
the
young
gentlemen
(
Briggs
excepted
)
gave
a
low
groan
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
drowned
in
the
tintinnabulation
of
the
gong
,
which
sounding
again
with
great
fury
,
there
was
a
general
move
towards
the
dining
-
room
;
still
excepting
Briggs
the
story
boy
,
who
remained
where
he
was
,
and
as
he
was
;
and
on
its
way
to
whom
Paul
presently
encountered
a
round
of
bread
,
genteelly
served
on
a
plate
and
napkin
,
and
with
a
silver
fork
lying
crosswise
on
the
top
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Doctor
Blimber
was
already
in
his
place
in
the
dining
-
room
,
at
the
top
of
the
table
,
with
Miss
Blimber
and
Mrs
Blimber
on
either
side
of
him
.
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
in
a
black
coat
was
at
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
Paul
's
chair
was
next
to
Miss
Blimber
;
but
it
being
found
,
when
he
sat
in
it
,
that
his
eyebrows
were
not
much
above
the
level
of
the
table
-
cloth
,
some
books
were
brought
in
from
the
Doctor
's
study
,
on
which
he
was
elevated
,
and
on
which
he
always
sat
from
that
time
---
carrying
them
in
and
out
himself
on
after
occasions
,
like
a
little
elephant
and
castle
.
  
<EOS>
Grace
having
been
said
by
the
Doctor
,
dinner
began
.
<EOS>
There
was
some
nice
soup
;
also
roast
meat
,
boiled
meat
,
vegetables
,
pie
,
and
cheese
.
<EOS>
Every
young
gentleman
had
a
massive
silver
fork
,
and
a
napkin
;
and
all
the
arrangements
were
stately
and
handsome
.
<EOS>
In
particular
,
there
was
a
butler
in
a
blue
coat
and
bright
buttons
,
who
gave
quite
a
winey
flavour
to
the
table
beer
;
he
poured
it
out
so
superbly
.
  
<EOS>
Nobody
spoke
,
unless
spoken
to
,
except
Doctor
Blimber
,
Mrs
Blimber
,
and
Miss
Blimber
,
who
conversed
occasionally
.
<EOS>
Whenever
a
young
gentleman
was
not
actually
engaged
with
his
knife
and
fork
or
spoon
,
his
eye
,
with
an
irresistible
attraction
,
sought
the
eye
of
doctor
Blimber
,
Mrs
Blimber
,
or
Miss
Blimber
,
and
modestly
rested
there
.
<EOS>
Toots
appeared
to
be
the
only
exception
to
this
rule
.
<EOS>
He
sat
next
Mr
Feeder
on
Paul
's
side
of
the
table
,
and
frequently
looked
behind
and
before
the
intervening
boys
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
Paul
.
   
<EOS>
Only
once
during
dinner
was
there
any
conversation
that
included
the
young
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
It
happened
at
the
epoch
of
the
cheese
,
when
the
Doctor
,
having
taken
a
glass
of
port
wine
,
and
hemmed
twice
or
thrice
,
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
It
is
remarkable
,
Mr
Feeder
,
that
the
Romans
---
"
   
At
the
mention
of
this
terrible
people
,
their
implacable
enemies
,
every
young
gentleman
fastened
his
gaze
upon
the
Doctor
,
with
an
assumption
of
the
deepest
interest
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
number
who
happened
to
be
drinking
,
and
who
caught
the
Doctor
's
eye
glaring
at
him
through
the
side
of
his
tumbler
,
left
off
so
hastily
that
he
was
convulsed
for
some
moments
,
and
in
the
sequel
ruined
Doctor
Blimber
's
point
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
remarkable
,
Mr
Feeder
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
beginning
again
slowly
,
"
that
the
Romans
,
in
those
gorgeous
and
profuse
entertainments
of
which
we
read
in
the
days
of
the
Emperors
,
when
luxury
had
attained
a
height
unknown
before
or
since
,
and
when
whole
provinces
were
ravaged
to
supply
the
splendid
means
of
one
Imperial
Banquet
---
"
  
Here
the
offender
,
who
had
been
swelling
and
straining
,
and
waiting
,
in
vain
for
a
full
stop
,
broke
out
violently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Johnson
,
"
said
Mr
Feeder
,
in
a
low
reproachful
voice
,
"
take
some
water
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Doctor
,
looking
very
stern
,
made
a
pause
until
the
water
was
brought
,
and
then
resumed
:
  
"
<EOS>
And
when
,
Mr
Feeder
---
"
  
<EOS>
But
Mr
Feeder
,
who
saw
that
Johnson
must
break
out
again
,
and
who
knew
that
the
Doctor
would
never
come
to
a
period
before
the
young
gentlemen
until
he
had
finished
all
he
meant
to
say
,
could
n't
keep
his
eye
off
Johnson
;
and
thus
was
caught
in
the
fact
of
not
looking
at
the
Doctor
,
who
consequently
stopped
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Feeder
,
reddening
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Doctor
Blimber
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
when
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
raising
his
voice
,
"
when
,
Sir
,
as
we
read
,
and
have
no
reason
to
doubt
---
incredible
as
it
may
appear
to
the
vulgar
of
our
time
---
the
brother
of
Vitellius
prepared
for
him
a
feast
,
in
which
were
served
,
of
fish
,
two
thousand
dishes

<EOS>
"
Take

Mr

Of

Or
try
a

said
Mr
Feeder
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
one
dish

"
pursued
Doctor
Blimber
,
raising
his
voice
still
higher
as
he
looked
all
<EOS>
round
the
table
,
"
called
,
from
its
enormous
dimensions

the

"

burst

said
Mr
Feeder

<EOS>
"
You
had
better
let
it
come

<EOS>
"
  
"
And
the
spawn
of
the
lamprey
,
brought

the
Carpathian
Sea

"
pursued
the
Doctor
,
in
his
severest
voice
;
"
when
we
read
of
costly
entertainments
such
as
these
,
and
still
remember

that

What

A

the

<EOS>
But
Johnson
,
unable
to
suppress
it
any
longer
,
burst
at
that
moment
into
such
an
overwhelming
fit
of
coughing
,
that
although
both
his
immediate
neighbours
thumped
him
on
the
back
,
and
Mr
Feeder
himself
held
a
glass
of
water
to
his
lips
,
and
the
butler
walked
him
up
and
down
several
times
between
his
own
chair
and
the
sideboard
,
like
a
sentry
,
it
was
full
five
minutes
before
he
was
moderately
composed
,
and
then
there
was
a
profound
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
said
Doctor
Blimber
,
"
rise
for
Grace
!
<EOS>
Cornelia
,
lift
Dombey
down
"
---
nothing
of
whom
but
his
scalp
was
accordingly
seen
above
the
tablecloth
.
"
<EOS>
Johnson
will
repeat
to
me
to
-
morrow
morning
before
breakfast
,
without
book
,
and
from
the
Greek
Testament
,
the
first
chapter
of
the
Epistle
of
Saint
Paul
to
the
Ephesians
.
<EOS>
We
will
resume
our
studies
,
Mr
Feeder
,
in
half
-
anhour
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
young
gentlemen
bowed
and
withdrew
.
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
did
likewise
.
<EOS>
During
the
half
-
hour
,
the
young
gentlemen
,
broken
into
pairs
,
loitered
arm
-
in
-
arm
up
and
down
a
small
piece
of
ground
behind
the
house
,
or
endeavoured
to
kindle
a
spark
of
animation
in
the
breast
of
Briggs
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
happened
so
vulgar
as
play
.
<EOS>
Punctually
at
the
appointed
time
,
the
gong
was
sounded
,
and
the
studies
,
under
the
joint
auspices
of
Doctor
Blimber
and
Mr
Feeder
,
were
resumed
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
Olympic
game
of
lounging
up
and
down
had
been
cut
shorter
than
usual
that
day
,
on
Johnson
's
account
,
they
all
went
out
for
a
walk
before
tea
.
<EOS>
Even
Briggs
(
though
he
had
n't
begun
yet
)
<EOS>
partook
of
this
dissipation
;
in
the
enjoyment
of
which
he
looked
over
the
cliff
two
or
three
times
darkly
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Blimber
accompanied
them
;
and
Paul
had
the
honour
of
being
taken
in
tow
by
the
Doctor
himself
:
a
distinguished
state
of
things
,
in
which
he
looked
very
little
and
feeble
.
  
<EOS>
Tea
was
served
in
a
style
no
less
polite
than
the
dinner
;
and
after
tea
,
the
young
gentlemen
rising
and
bowing
as
before
,
withdrew
to
fetch
up
the
unfinished
tasks
of
that
day
,
or
to
get
up
the
already
looming
tasks
of
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Mr
Feeder
withdrew
to
his
own
room
;
and
Paul
sat
in
a
corner
wondering
whether
Florence
was
thinking
of
him
,
and
what
they
were
all
about
at
Mrs
Pipchin
's
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
who
had
been
detained
by
an
important
letter
from
the
Duke
of
Wellington
,
found
Paul
out
after
a
time
;
and
having
looked
at
him
for
a
long
while
,
as
before
,
inquired
if
he
was
fond
of
waistcoats
.
  
<EOS>
Paul
said
"
Yes
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
So
am
I
,
"
said
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
No
word
more
spake
Toots
that
night
;
but
he
stood
looking
at
Paul
as
if
he
liked
him
;
and
as
there
was
company
in
that
,
and
Paul
was
not
inclined
to
talk
,
it
answered
his
purpose
better
than
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
At
eight
o'clock
or
so
,
the
gong
sounded
again
for
prayers
in
the
dining
-
room
,
where
the
butler
afterwards
presided
over
a
side
-
table
,
on
which
bread
and
cheese
and
been
were
spread
for
such
young
gentlemen
as
desired
to
partake
of
those
refreshments
.
<EOS>
The
ceremonies
concluded
by
the
Doctor
's
saying
,
"
Gentlemen
,
we
will
resume
our
studies
at
seven
to
-
morrow
;
"
and
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
Paul
saw
Cornelia
Blimber
's
eye
"
and
saw
that
it
was
upon
him
.
<EOS>
When
the
Doctor
had
said
these
words
,
"
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
we
will
resume
our
studies
at
even
to
-
morrow
,
"
the
pupils
bowed
again
,
and
went
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
confidence
of
their
own
room
up
stairs
,
Briggs
said
his
head
ached
ready
to
split
,
and
that
he
should
wish
himself
dead
if
it
was
n't
for
his
mother
,
and
a
blackbird
he
had
at
home
.
<EOS>
Tozer
did
n't
say
much
,
but
he
sighed
a
good
deal
,
and
told
Paul
to
look
out
,
for
his
turn
would
come
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
After
uttering
those
prophetic
words
,
he
undressed
himself
moodily
,
and
got
into
bed
.
<EOS>
Briggs
was
in
his
bed
too
,
and
Paul
in
his
bed
too
,
before
the
weak
-
eyed
young
man
appeared
to
take
away
the
candle
,
when
he
wished
them
good
night
and
pleasant
dreams
.
<EOS>
But
his
benevolent
wishes
were
in
vain
,
as
far
as
Briggs
and
Tozer
were
concerned
;
for
Paul
,
who
lay
awake
for
a
long
while
,
and
often
woke
afterwards
,
found
that
Briggs
was
ridden
by
his
lesson
as
a
nightmare
:
and
that
Tozer
,
whose
mind
was
affected
in
his
sleep
by
similar
causes
,
in
a
minor
degree
,
talked
unknown
tongues
,
or
scraps
of
Greek
and
Latin
<EOS>
---
it
was
all
one
to
Paul
---
which
,
in
the
silence
of
night
,
had
an
inexpressibly
wicked
and
guilty
effect
.
  
<EOS>
Paul
had
sunk
into
a
sweet
sleep
,
and
dreamed
that
he
was
walking
hand
in
hand
with
Florence
through
beautiful
gardens
,
when
they
came
to
a
large
sunflower
which
suddenly
expanded
itself
into
a
gong
,
and
began
to
sound
.
<EOS>
Opening
his
eyes
,
he
found
that
it
was
a
dark
,
windy
morning
,
with
a
drizzling
rain
:
and
that
the
real
gong
was
giving
dreadful
note
of
preparation
,
down
in
the
hall
.
  
<EOS>
So
he
got
up
directly
,
and
found
Briggs
with
hardly
any
eyes
,
for
nightmare
and
grief
had
made
his
face
puffy
,
putting
his
boots
,
on
:
while
Tozer
stood
shivering
and
rubbing
his
shoulders
in
a
very
bad
humour
.
<EOS>
Poor
Paul
could
n't
dress
himself
easily
,
not
being
used
to
it
,
and
asked
them
if
they
would
have
the
goodness
to
tie
some
strings
for
him
;
but
as
Briggs
merely
said
"
Bother
!
"
<EOS>
and
Tozer
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
!
"
he
went
down
when
he
was
otherwise
ready
,
to
the
next
story
,
where
he
saw
a
pretty
young
woman
in
leather
gloves
,
cleaning
a
stove
.
<EOS>
The
young
woman
seemed
surprised
at
his
appearance
,
and
asked
him
where
his
mother
was
.
<EOS>
When
Paul
told
her
she
was
dead
,
she
took
her
gloves
off
,
and
did
what
he
wanted
;
and
furthermore
rubbed
his
hands
to
warm
them
;
and
gave
him
a
kiss
;
and
told
him
whenever
he
wanted
anything
of
that
sort
---
meaning
in
the
dressing
way
---
to
ask
for
"
Melia
;
which
Paul
,
thanking
her
very
much
,
said
he
certainly
would
.
<EOS>
He
then
proceeded
softly
on
his
journey
down
stairs
,
towards
the
room
in
which
the
young
gentlemen
resumed
their
studies
,
when
,
passing
by
a
door
that
stood
ajar
,
a
voice
from
within
cried
,
"
Is
that
Dombey
?
"
<EOS>
On
Paul
replying
,
"
Yes
,
ma'am
:
"
<EOS>
for
he
knew
the
voice
to
be
Miss
Blimber
's
:
Miss
Blimber
said
,
"
Come
in
,
Dombey
.
"
<EOS>
And
in
he
went
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Blimber
presented
exactly
the
appearance
she
had
presented
yesterday
,
except
that
she
wore
a
shawl
.
<EOS>
Her
little
light
curls
were
as
crisp
as
ever
,
and
she
had
already
her
spectacles
on
,
which
made
Paul
wonder
whether
she
went
to
bed
in
them
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
cool
little
sitting
-
room
of
her
own
up
there
,
with
some
books
in
it
,
and
no
fire
.
<EOS>
But
Miss
Blimber
was
never
cold
,
and
never
sleepy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Dombey
,
"
said
Miss
Blimber
,
"
I
am
going
out
for
a
constitutional
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Paul
wondered
what
that
was
,
and
why
she
did
n't
send
the
footman
out
to
get
it
in
such
unfavourable
weather
.
<EOS>
But
he
made
no
observation
on
the
subject
:
his
attention
being
devoted
to
a
little
pile
of
new
books
on
which
Miss
Blimber
appeared
to
have
been
recently
engaged
.
  
<EOS>
"
These
are
yours
,
Dombey
,
"
said
Miss
Blimber
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
of
'em
,
Ma'am
?
"
said
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
returned
Miss
Blimber
;
"
and
Mr
Feeder
will
look
you
out
some
more
very
soon
,
if
you
are
as
studious
as
I
expect
you
will
be
,
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Ma'am
,
"
said
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
out
for
a
constitutional
,
"
resumed
Miss
Blimber
;
"
and
while
I
am
gone
,
that
is
to
say
in
the
interval
between
this
and
breakfast
,
Dombey
,
I
wish
you
to
read
over
what
I
have
marked
in
these
books
,
and
to
tell
me
if
you
quite
understand
what
you
have
got
to
learn
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
lose
time
,
Dombey
,
for
you
have
none
to
spare
,
but
take
them
down
stairs
and
begin
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
Ma'am
,
"
answered
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
so
many
of
them
,
that
although
Paul
put
one
hand
under
the
bottom
book
and
his
other
hand
and
his
chin
on
the
top
book
,
and
hugged
them
all
closely
,
the
middle
book
slipped
out
before
he
reached
the
door
,
and
then
they
all
tumbled
down
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Miss
Blimber
said
,
"
Oh
,
Dombey
,
Dombey
,
this
is
really
very
careless
!
"
and
piled
them
up
afresh
for
him
;
and
this
time
,
by
dint
of
balancing
them
with
great
nicety
,
Paul
got
out
of
the
room
,
and
down
a
few
stairs
before
two
of
them
escaped
again
.
<EOS>
But
he
held
the
rest
so
tight
,
that
he
only
left
one
more
on
the
first
floor
,
and
one
in
the
passage
;
and
when
he
had
got
the
main
body
down
into
the
school
-
room
,
he
set
off
up
stairs
again
to
collect
the
stragglers
.
<EOS>
Having
at
last
amassed
the
whole
library
,
and
climbed
into
his
place
,
he
fell
to
work
,
encouraged
by
a
remark
from
Tozer
to
the
effect
that
he
"
was
in
for
it
now
;
"
which
was
the
only
interruption
he
received
till
breakfast
time
.
<EOS>
At
that
meal
,
for
which
he
had
no
appetite
,
everything
was
quite
as
solemn
and
genteel
as
at
the
other
;
and
when
it
was
finished
,
he
followed
Miss
Blimber
up
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Dombey
,
"
said
Miss
Blimber
.
<EOS>
"
How
have
you
got
on
with
those
books
?
"
  
<EOS>
They
comprised
a
little
English
,
and
a
deal
of
Latin
---
names
of
things
,
declensions
of
articles
and
substantives
,
exercises
thereon
,
and
preliminary
rules
---
a
trifle
of
orthography
,
a
glance
at
ancient
history
,
a
wink
or
two
at
modern
ditto
,
a
few
tables
,
two
or
three
weights
and
measures
,
and
a
little
general
information
.
<EOS>
When
poor
Paul
had
spelt
out
number
two
,
he
found
he
had
no
idea
of
number
one
;
fragments
whereof
afterwards
obtruded
themselves
into
number
three
,
which
slided
into
number
four
,
which
grafted
itself
on
to
number
two
.
<EOS>
So
that
whether
twenty
Romuluses
made
a
Remus
,
or
hic
haec
hoc
was
troy
weight
,
or
a
verb
always
agreed
with
an
ancient
Briton
,
or
three
times
four
was
Taurus
a
bull
,
were
open
questions
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Dombey
,
Dombey
!
"
said
Miss
Blimber
,
"
this
is
very
shocking
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
"
said
Paul
,
"
I
think
if
I
might
sometimes
talk
a
little
to
old
Glubb
,
I
should
be
able
to
do
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nonsense
,
Dombey
,
"
said
Miss
Blimber
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
This
is
not
the
place
for
Glubbs
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
You
must
take
the
books
down
,
I
suppose
,
Dombey
,
one
by
one
,
and
perfect
yourself
in
the
day
's
instalment
of
subject
A
,
before
you
turn
at
all
to
subject
B.
<EOS>
And
now
take
away
the
top
book
,
if
you
please
,
Dombey
,
and
return
when
you
are
master
of
the
theme
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Blimber
expressed
her
opinions
on
the
subject
of
Paul
's
uninstructed
state
with
a
gloomy
delight
,
as
if
she
had
expected
this
result
,
and
were
glad
to
find
that
they
must
be
in
constant
communication
.
<EOS>
Paul
withdrew
with
the
top
task
,
as
he
was
told
,
and
laboured
away
at
it
,
down
below
;
sometimes
remembering
every
word
of
it
,
and
sometimes
forgetting
it
all
,
and
everything
else
besides
:
until
at
last
he
ventured
up
stairs
again
to
repeat
the
lesson
,
when
it
was
nearly
all
driven
out
of
his
head
before
he
began
,
by
Miss
Blimber
's
shutting
up
the
book
,
and
saying
,
"
Go
on
,
Dombey
!
"
<EOS>
a
proceeding
so
suggestive
of
the
knowledge
inside
of
her
,
that
Paul
looked
upon
the
young
lady
with
consternation
,
as
a
kind
of
learned
Guy
Faux
,
or
artificial
Bogle
,
stuffed
full
of
scholastic
straw
.
  
<EOS>
He
acquitted
himself
very
well
,
nevertheless
;
and
Miss
Blimber
,
commending
him
as
giving
promise
of
getting
on
fast
,
immediately
provided
him
with
subject
B
;
from
which
he
passed
to
C
,
and
even
D
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
It
was
hard
work
,
resuming
his
studies
,
soon
after
dinner
;
and
he
felt
giddy
and
confused
and
drowsy
and
dull
.
<EOS>
But
all
the
other
young
gentlemen
had
similar
sensations
,
and
were
obliged
to
resume
their
studies
too
,
if
there
were
any
comfort
in
that
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
wonder
that
the
great
clock
in
the
hall
,
instead
of
being
constant
to
its
first
inquiry
,
never
said
,
"
Gentlemen
,
we
will
now
resume
our
studies
,
"
for
that
phrase
was
often
enough
repeated
in
its
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
The
studies
went
round
like
a
mighty
wheel
,
and
the
young
gentlemen
were
always
stretched
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
After
tea
there
were
exercises
again
,
and
preparations
for
next
day
by
candlelight
.
<EOS>
And
in
due
course
there
was
bed
;
where
,
but
for
that
resumption
of
the
studies
which
took
place
in
dreams
,
were
rest
and
sweet
forgetfulness
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
Saturdays
!
<EOS>
Oh
happy
Saturdays
,
when
Florence
always
came
at
noon
,
and
never
would
,
in
any
weather
,
stay
away
,
though
Mrs
Pipchin
snarled
and
growled
,
and
worried
her
bitterly
.
<EOS>
Those
Saturdays
,
were
Sabbaths
for
at
least
two
little
Christians
among
all
the
Jews
,
and
did
the
holy
Sabbath
work
of
strengthening
and
knitting
up
a
brother
's
and
a
sister
's
love
.
  
<EOS>
Not
even
Sunday
nights
---
the
heavy
Sunday
nights
,
whose
shadow
darkened
the
first
waking
burst
of
light
on
Sunday
mornings
---
could
mar
those
precious
Saturdays
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
the
great
sea
-
shore
,
where
they
sat
,
and
strolled
together
;
or
whether
it
was
only
Mrs
Pipchin
's
dull
back
room
,
in
which
she
sang
to
him
so
softly
,
with
his
drowsy
head
upon
her
arm
;
Paul
never
cared
.
<EOS>
It
was
Florence
.
<EOS>
That
was
all
he
thought
of
.
<EOS>
So
,
on
Sunday
nights
,
when
the
Doctor
's
dark
door
stood
agape
to
swallow
him
up
for
another
week
,
the
time
was
come
for
taking
leave
of
Florence
;
no
one
else
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Wickam
had
been
drafted
home
to
the
house
in
town
,
and
Miss
Nipper
,
now
a
smart
young
woman
,
had
come
down
.
<EOS>
To
many
a
single
combat
with
Mrs
Pipchin
,
did
Miss
Nipper
gallantly
devote
herself
;
and
if
ever
Mrs
Pipchin
in
all
her
life
had
found
her
match
,
she
had
found
it
now
.
<EOS>
Miss
Nipper
threw
away
the
scabbard
the
first
morning
she
arose
in
Mrs
Pipchin
's
house
.
<EOS>
She
asked
and
gave
no
quarter
.
<EOS>
She
said
it
must
be
war
,
and
war
it
was
;
and
Mrs
Pipchin
lived
from
that
time
in
the
midst
of
surprises
,
harassings
,
and
defiances
,
and
skirmishing
attacks
that
came
bouncing
in
upon
her
from
the
passage
,
even
in
unguarded
moments
of
chops
,
and
carried
desolation
to
her
very
toast
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Nipper
had
returned
one
Sunday
night
with
Florence
,
from
walking
back
with
Paul
to
the
Doctor
's
,
when
Florence
took
from
her
bosom
a
little
piece
of
paper
,
on
which
she
had
pencilled
down
some
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
See
here
,
Susan
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
These
are
the
names
of
the
little
books
that
Paul
brings
home
to
do
those
long
exercises
with
,
when
he
is
so
tired
.
<EOS>
I
copied
them
last
night
while
he
was
writing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
shew'em
to
me
,
Miss
Floy
,
if
you
please
,
"
returned
Nipper
,
"
<EOS>
I
'd
as
soon
see
Mrs
Pipchin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
buy
them
for
me
,
Susan
,
if
you
will
,
tomorrow
morning
.
<EOS>
I
have
money
enough
,
"
said
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
goodness
gracious
me
,
Miss
Floy
,
"
returned
Miss
Nipper
,
"
how
can
you
talk
like
that
,
when
you
have
books
upon
books
already
,
and
masterses
and
missesses
a
teaching
of
you
everything
continual
,
though
my
belief
is
that
your
Pa
,
Miss
Dombey
,
never
would
have
learnt
you
nothing
,
never
would
have
thought
of
it
,
unless
you
'd
asked
him
---
when
he
could
n't
well
refuse
;
but
giving
consent
when
asked
,
and
offering
when
unasked
,
Miss
,
is
quite
two
things
;
I
may
not
have
my
objections
to
a
young
man
's
keeping
company
with
me
,
and
when
he
puts
the
question
,
may
say
"
yes
,
"
but
that
's
not
saying
"
would
you
be
so
kind
as
like
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
you
can
buy
me
the
books
,
Susan
;
and
you
will
,
when
you
know
I
want
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Miss
,
and
why
do
you
want'em
?
"
replied
Nipper
;
adding
,
in
a
lower
voice
,
"
If
it
was
to
fling
at
Mrs
Pipchin
's
head
,
I
'd
buy
a
cart
-
load
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
could
perhaps
give
Paul
some
help
,
Susan
,
if
I
had
these
books
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
and
make
the
coming
week
a
little
easier
to
him
.
<EOS>
At
least
I
want
to
try
.
<EOS>
So
buy
them
for
me
,
dear
,
and
<EOS>
I
will
never
forget
how
kind
it
was
of
you
to
do
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
must
have
been
a
harder
heart
than
Susan
Nipper
's
that
could
have
rejected
the
little
purse
Florence
held
out
with
these
words
,
or
the
gentle
look
of
entreaty
with
which
she
seconded
her
petition
.
<EOS>
Susan
put
the
purse
in
her
pocket
without
reply
,
and
trotted
out
at
once
upon
her
errand
.
  
<EOS>
The
books
were
not
easy
to
procure
:
and
the
answer
at
several
shops
was
,
either
that
they
were
just
out
of
them
,
or
that
they
never
kept
them
,
or
that
they
had
had
a
great
many
last
month
,
or
that
they
expected
a
great
many
next
week
.
<EOS>
But
Susan
was
not
easily
baffled
inn
such
an
enterprise
;
and
having
entrapped
a
white
-
haired
youth
,
in
a
black
calico
apron
,
from
a
library
where
she
was
known
,
to
accompany
her
in
her
quest
,
she
led
him
such
a
life
in
going
up
and
down
,
that
he
exerted
himself
to
the
utmost
,
if
it
were
only
to
get
rid
of
her
;
and
finally
enabled
her
to
return
home
in
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
With
these
treasures
then
,
after
her
own
daily
lessons
were
over
,
florence
sat
down
at
night
to
track
Paul
's
footsteps
through
the
thorny
ways
of
learning
;
and
being
possessed
of
a
naturally
quick
and
sound
capacity
,
and
taught
by
that
most
wonderful
of
masters
,
love
,
it
was
not
long
before
she
gained
upon
Paul
's
heels
,
and
caught
and
passed
him
.
  
<EOS>
Not
a
word
of
this
was
breathed
to
Mrs
Pipchin
:
but
many
a
night
when
they
were
all
in
bed
,
and
when
Miss
Nipper
,
with
her
hair
in
papers
and
herself
asleep
in
some
uncomfortable
attitude
,
reposed
unconscious
by
her
side
;
and
when
the
chinking
ashes
in
the
grate
were
cold
and
grey
;
and
when
the
candles
were
burnt
down
and
guttering
out
;
---
Florence
tried
so
hard
to
be
a
substitute
for
one
small
Dombey
,
that
her
fortitude
and
perseverance
might
have
almost
won
her
a
free
right
to
bear
the
name
herself
.
  
<EOS>
And
high
was
her
reward
,
<EOS>
when
one
Saturday
evening
,
as
little
Paul
was
sitting
down
as
usual
to
"
resume
his
studies
,
"
she
sat
down
by
his
side
,
and
showed
him
all
that
was
so
rough
,
made
smooth
,
and
all
that
was
so
dark
,
made
clear
and
plain
,
before
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
but
a
startled
look
in
Paul
's
wan
face
---
a
flush
---
a
smile
---
and
then
a
close
embrace
---
but
God
knows
how
her
heart
leapt
up
at
this
rich
payment
for
her
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Floy
!
"
cried
her
brother
,
"
how
I
love
you
!
<EOS>
How
I
love
you
,
Floy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
you
,
dear
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
am
sure
of
that
,
Floy
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
said
no
more
about
it
,
but
all
that
evening
sat
close
by
her
,
very
quiet
;
and
in
the
night
he
called
out
from
his
little
room
within
hers
,
three
or
four
times
,
that
he
loved
her
.
  
<EOS>
Regularly
,
after
that
,
Florence
was
prepared
to
sit
down
with
Paul
on
Saturday
night
,
and
patiently
assist
him
through
so
much
as
they
could
anticipate
together
,
of
his
next
week
's
work
.
<EOS>
The
cheering
thought
that
he
was
labouring
on
where
Florence
had
just
toiled
before
him
,
would
,
of
itself
,
have
been
a
stimulant
to
Paul
in
the
perpetual
resumption
of
his
studies
;
but
coupled
with
the
actual
lightening
of
his
load
,
consequent
on
this
assistance
,
it
saved
him
,
possibly
,
from
sinking
underneath
the
burden
which
the
fair
Cornelia
Blimber
piled
upon
his
back
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
Miss
Blimber
meant
to
be
too
hard
upon
him
,
or
that
Doctor
Blimber
meant
to
bear
too
heavily
on
the
young
gentlemen
in
general
.
<EOS>
Cornelia
merely
held
the
faith
in
which
she
had
been
bred
;
and
the
Doctor
,
in
some
partial
confusion
of
his
ideas
,
regarded
the
young
gentlemen
as
if
they
were
all
Doctors
,
and
were
born
grown
up
.
<EOS>
Comforted
by
the
applause
of
the
young
gentlemen
's
nearest
relations
,
and
urged
on
by
their
blind
vanity
and
illconsidered
haste
,
it
would
have
been
strange
if
Doctor
Blimber
had
discovered
his
mistake
,
or
trimmed
his
swelling
sails
to
any
other
tack
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
in
the
case
of
Paul
.
<EOS>
When
Doctor
Blimber
said
he
made
great
progress
,
and
was
naturally
clever
,
Mr
Dombey
was
more
bent
than
ever
on
his
being
forced
and
crammed
.
<EOS>
In
the
case
of
Briggs
,
when
Doctor
Blimber
reported
that
he
did
not
make
great
progress
yet
,
and
was
not
naturally
clever
,
Briggs
senior
was
inexorable
in
the
same
purpose
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
however
high
and
false
the
temperature
at
which
the
Doctor
kept
his
hothouse
,
the
owners
of
the
plants
were
always
ready
to
lend
a
helping
hand
at
the
bellows
,
and
to
stir
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
Such
spirits
as
he
had
in
the
outset
,
Paul
soon
lost
of
course
.
<EOS>
But
he
retained
all
that
was
strange
,
and
old
,
and
thoughtful
to
the
in
his
character
:
and
under
circumstances
so
favourable
to
the
development
of
those
tendencies
,
became
even
more
strange
,
and
old
,
and
thoughtful
,
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
difference
was
,
that
he
kept
his
character
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
grew
more
thoughtful
and
reserved
,
every
day
;
and
had
no
such
curiosity
in
any
living
member
of
the
Doctor
's
household
,
as
he
had
had
in
Mrs
Pipchin
.
<EOS>
He
loved
to
be
alone
;
and
in
those
short
intervals
when
he
was
not
occupied
with
his
books
,
liked
nothing
so
well
as
wandering
about
the
house
by
himself
,
or
sitting
on
the
stairs
,
listening
to
the
great
clock
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
He
was
intimate
with
all
the
paper
-
hanging
in
the
house
;
saw
things
that
no
one
else
saw
in
the
patterns
;
found
out
miniature
tigers
and
lions
running
up
the
bedroom
walls
,
and
squinting
faces
leering
in
the
squares
and
diamonds
of
the
floor
-
cloth
.
  
<EOS>
The
solitary
child
lived
on
,
surrounded
by
this
arabesque
work
of
his
musing
fancy
,
and
no
one
understood
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Blimber
thought
him
"
odd
,
"
and
sometimes
the
servants
said
among
themselves
that
little
Dombey
"
moped
;
"
but
that
was
all
.
  
<EOS>
Unless
young
Toots
had
some
idea
on
the
subject
,
to
the
expression
of
which
he
was
wholly
unequal
.
<EOS>
Ideas
,
like
ghosts
(
according
to
the
common
notion
of
ghosts
)
,
must
be
spoken
to
a
little
before
they
will
explain
themselves
;
and
Toots
had
long
left
off
asking
any
questions
of
his
own
mind
.
<EOS>
Some
mist
there
may
have
been
,
issuing
from
that
leaden
casket
,
his
cranium
,
which
,
if
it
could
have
taken
shape
and
form
,
would
have
become
a
genie
;
but
it
could
not
;
and
it
only
so
far
followed
the
example
of
the
smoke
in
the
Arabian
story
,
as
to
roll
out
in
a
thick
cloud
,
and
there
hang
and
hover
.
<EOS>
But
it
left
a
little
figure
visible
upon
a
lonely
shore
,
and
Toots
was
always
staring
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
would
say
to
Paul
,
fifty
times
a
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
well
,
Sir
,
thank
you
,
"
Paul
would
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shake
hands
,
"
would
be
Toots
's
next
advance
.
  
<EOS>
Which
Paul
,
of
course
,
would
immediately
do
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
generally
said
again
,
after
a
long
interval
of
staring
and
hard
breathing
,
"
How
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
To
which
Paul
again
replied
,
"
Quite
well
,
Sir
,
thank
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
One
evening
Mr
Toots
was
sitting
at
his
desk
,
oppressed
by
correspondence
,
when
a
great
purpose
seemed
to
flash
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
laid
down
his
pen
,
and
went
off
to
seek
Paul
,
whom
he
found
at
last
,
after
a
long
search
,
looking
through
the
window
of
his
little
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Toots
,
speaking
the
moment
he
entered
the
room
,
lest
he
should
forget
it
;
"
what
do
you
think
about
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
think
about
a
great
many
things
,
"
replied
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
,
though
?
"
said
Toots
,
appearing
to
consider
that
fact
in
itself
surprising
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
to
die
,
"
said
Paul
,
looking
up
into
his
face
---
   
Mr
Toots
started
,
and
seemed
much
disturbed
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
Do
n't
you
think
you
would
rather
die
on
a
moonlight
night
when
the
sky
was
quite
clear
,
and
the
wind
blowing
,
as
it
did
last
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
said
,
looking
doubtfully
at
Paul
,
and
shaking
his
head
,
that
he
did
n't
know
about
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
blowing
,
at
least
,
"
said
Paul
,
"
but
sounding
in
the
air
like
the
sea
sounds
in
the
shells
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
beautiful
night
.
<EOS>
When
I
had
listened
to
the
water
for
a
long
time
,
I
got
up
and
looked
out
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
boat
over
there
,
in
the
full
light
of
the
moon
;
a
boat
with
a
sail
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
child
looked
at
him
so
steadfastly
,
and
spoke
so
earnestly
,
that
Mr
Toots
,
feeling
himself
called
upon
to
say
something
about
this
boat
,
said
,
"
Smugglers
.
"
<EOS>
But
with
an
impartial
remembrance
of
there
being
two
sides
to
every
question
,
he
added
,
"
or
Preventive
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
boat
with
a
sail
,
"
repeated
Paul
,
"
in
the
full
light
of
the
moon
.
<EOS>
The
sail
like
an
arm
,
all
silver
.
<EOS>
It
went
away
into
the
distance
,
and
what
do
you
think
it
seemed
to
do
as
it
moved
with
the
waves
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pitch
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
seemed
to
beckon
,
"
said
the
child
,
"
to
beckon
me
to
come
!
<EOS>
---
There
she
is
!
<EOS>
There
she
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
Toots
was
almost
beside
himself
with
dismay
at
this
sudden
exclamation
,
after
what
had
gone
before
,
and
cried
"
Who
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
sister
Florence
!
"
cried
Paul
,
"
looking
up
here
,
and
waving
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
sees
me
---
she
sees
me
!
<EOS>
Good
night
<EOS>
,
dear
,
good
night
,
good
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
quick
transition
to
a
state
of
unbounded
pleasure
,
as
he
stood
at
his
window
,
kissing
and
clapping
his
hands
:
and
the
way
in
which
the
light
retreated
from
his
features
as
she
passed
out
of
his
view
,
and
left
a
patient
melancholy
on
the
little
face
:
were
too
remarkable
wholly
to
escape
even
Toots
's
notice
.
<EOS>
Their
interview
being
interrupted
at
this
moment
by
a
visit
from
Mrs
Pipchin
,
who
usually
brought
her
black
skirts
to
bear
upon
Paul
just
before
dusk
,
once
or
twice
a
week
,
Toots
had
no
opportunity
of
improving
the
occasion
:
but
it
left
so
marked
an
impression
on
his
mind
that
he
twice
returned
,
after
having
exchanged
the
usual
salutations
,
to
ask
Mrs
Pipchin
how
she
did
.
<EOS>
This
the
irascible
old
lady
conceived
to
be
a
deeply
-
devised
and
longmeditated
insult
,
originating
in
the
diabolical
invention
of
the
weak
-
eyed
young
man
down
-
stairs
,
against
whom
she
accordingly
lodged
a
formal
complaint
with
Doctor
Blimber
that
very
night
;
who
mentioned
to
the
young
man
that
if
he
ever
did
it
again
,
he
should
be
obliged
to
part
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
evenings
being
longer
now
,
Paul
stole
up
to
his
window
every
evening
to
look
out
for
Florence
.
<EOS>
She
always
passed
and
repassed
at
a
certain
time
,
until
she
saw
him
;
and
their
mutual
recognition
was
a
gleam
of
sunshine
in
Paul
's
daily
life
.
<EOS>
Often
after
dark
,
one
other
figure
walked
alone
before
the
Doctor
's
house
.
<EOS>
He
rarely
joined
them
on
the
Saturday
now
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
He
would
rather
come
unrecognised
,
and
look
up
at
the
windows
where
his
son
was
qualifying
for
a
man
;
and
wait
,
and
watch
,
and
plan
,
and
hope
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
!
could
he
but
have
seen
,
or
seen
as
others
did
,
the
slight
spare
boy
above
,
watching
the
waves
and
clouds
at
twilight
,
with
his
earnest
eyes
,
and
breasting
the
window
of
his
solitary
cage
when
birds
flew
by
,
as
if
he
would
have
emulated
them
,
and
soared
away
!

<EOS>
MR
DOMBEY
'S
offices
were
in
a
court
where
there
was
an
old
-
established
stall
of
choice
fruit
at
the
corner
:
where
perambulating
merchants
,
of
both
sexes
,
offered
for
sale
at
any
time
between
the
hours
of
ten
and
five
,
slippers
,
pocket
-
books
,
sponges
,
dogs
'
collars
,
and
Windsor
soap
,
and
sometimes
a
pointer
or
an
oil
-
painting
.
  
<EOS>
The
pointer
always
came
that
way
,
with
a
view
to
the
Stock
Exchange
,
where
a
sporting
taste
(
originating
generally
in
bets
of
new
hats
)
is
much
in
vogue
.
<EOS>
The
other
commodities
were
addressed
to
the
general
public
;
but
they
were
never
offered
by
the
vendors
to
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
When
he
appeared
,
the
dealers
in
those
wares
fell
off
respectfully
.
<EOS>
The
principal
slipper
and
dogs
'
collar
man
---
who
considered
himself
a
public
character
,
and
whose
portrait
was
screwed
on
to
an
artist
's
door
in
Cheapside
---
threw
up
his
forefinger
to
the
brim
of
his
hat
as
Mr
Dombey
went
by
.
<EOS>
The
ticket
-
porter
,
if
he
were
not
absent
on
a
job
,
always
ran
officiously
before
to
open
Mr
Dombey
's
office
door
as
wide
as
possible
,
and
hold
it
open
,
with
his
hat
off
,
while
he
entered
.
   
<EOS>
The
clerks
within
were
not
a
whit
behind
-
hand
in
their
demonstrations
of
respect
.
<EOS>
A
solemn
hush
prevailed
,
as
Mr
Dombey
passed
through
the
outer
office
.
<EOS>
The
wit
of
the
Counting
-
House
became
in
a
moment
as
mute
,
as
the
row
of
leathern
fire
-
buckets
hanging
up
behind
him
.
<EOS>
Such
vapid
and
flat
daylight
as
filtered
through
the
ground
-
glass
windows
and
skylight
,
leaving
a
black
sediment
upon
the
panes
,
showed
the
books
and
papers
,
and
the
figures
bending
over
them
,
enveloped
in
a
studious
gloom
,
and
as
much
abstracted
in
appearance
,
from
the
world
without
,
as
if
they
were
assembled
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
;
while
a
mouldy
little
strong
room
in
the
obscure
perspective
,
where
a
shady
lamp
was
always
burning
,
might
have
represented
the
cavern
of
some
ocean
-
monster
,
looking
on
with
a
red
eye
at
these
mysteries
of
the
deep
.
   
<EOS>
When
Perch
the
messenger
,
whose
place
was
on
a
little
bracket
,
like
a
timepiece
,
saw
Mr
Dombey
come
in
---
or
rather
when
he
felt
that
he
was
coming
,
for
he
had
usually
an
instinctive
sense
of
his
approach
---
he
hurried
into
Mr
Dombey
's
room
,
stirred
the
fire
,
quarried
fresh
coals
from
the
bowels
of
the
coal
-
box
,
hung
the
newspaper
to
air
upon
the
fender
,
put
the
chair
ready
,
and
screen
in
its
place
,
and
was
round
upon
his
heel
on
the
instant
of
Mt.
Dombey
's
entrance
,
to
take
his
great
-
coat
and
hat
,
and
hang
them
up
.
<EOS>
Then
Perch
took
the
newspaper
,
and
gave
it
a
turn
or
two
in
his
hands
before
the
fire
,
and
laid
it
,
deferentially
,
at
Mr
Dombey
's
elbow
.
<EOS>
And
so
little
objection
had
Perch
to
doing
deferential
in
thelast
degree
,
that
if
he
might
have
laid
himself
at
Mr
Dombey
's
feet
,
or
might
have
called
him
by
some
such
title
as
used
to
be
bestowed
upon
the
Caliph
Haroun
Alraschid
,
he
would
have
been
all
the
better
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
As
this
honour
would
have
been
an
innovation
and
an
experiment
,
Perch
was
fain
to
content
himself
by
expressing
as
well
as
he
could
,
in
his
manner
,
You
are
the
light
of
my
Eyes
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
Breath
of
my
Soul
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
commander
of
the
Faithful
Perch
!
<EOS>
With
this
imperfect
happiness
to
cheer
him
,
he
would
shut
the
door
softly
,
walk
away
on
tiptoe
,
and
leave
his
great
chief
to
be
stared
at
,
through
a
dome
-
shaped
window
in
the
leads
,
by
ugly
chimney
-
pots
and
backs
of
houses
,
and
especially
by
the
bold
window
of
a
hair
-
cutting
saloon
on
a
first
floor
,
where
a
waxen
effigy
,
bald
as
a
Mussulman
in
the
morning
,
and
covered
after
eleven
o'clock
in
the
day
,
with
luxuriant
hair
and
whiskers
in
the
latest
Christian
fashion
,
showed
him
the
wrong
side
of
its
head
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
Between
Mr
Dombey
and
the
common
world
,
as
it
was
accessible
through
the
medium
of
the
outer
office
---
to
which
Mr
Dombey
's
presence
in
his
own
room
may
be
said
to
have
struck
like
damp
,
or
cold
air
<EOS>
---
there
were
two
degrees
of
descent
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
in
his
own
office
was
the
first
step
;
Mr
Morfin
,
in
his
own
office
,
was
the
second
.
<EOS>
Each
of
these
gentlemen
occupied
a
little
chamber
like
a
bath
-
room
,
opening
from
the
passage
outside
Mr
Dombey
's
door
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
,
as
Grand
Vizier
,
inhabited
the
room
that
was
nearest
to
the
Sultan
.
<EOS>
Mr
Morfin
,
as
an
officer
of
inferior
state
,
inhabited
the
room
that
was
nearest
to
the
clerks
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
last
mentioned
was
a
cheerful
-
looking
,
hazel
-
eyed
elderly
bachelor
:
gravely
attired
,
as
to
his
upper
man
,
in
black
;
and
as
to
his
legs
,
in
pepper
-
and
-
salt
colour
.
<EOS>
His
dark
hair
was
just
touched
here
and
there
with
specks
of
grey
,
as
though
the
tread
of
Time
had
splashed
it
;
and
his
whiskers
were
already
white
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
mighty
respect
for
Mr
Dombey
,
and
rendered
him
due
homage
;
but
as
he
was
of
a
genial
temper
himself
,
and
never
wholly
at
his
ease
in
that
stately
presence
,
he
was
disquieted
by
no
jealousy
of
the
many
conferences
enjoyed
by
Mr
Carker
,
and
felt
a
secret
satisfaction
in
having
duties
to
discharge
,
which
rarely
exposed
him
to
be
singled
out
for
such
distinction
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
great
musical
amateur
in
his
way
---
after
business
;
and
had
a
paternal
affection
for
his
violoncello
,
which
was
once
in
every
week
transported
from
Islington
,
his
place
of
abode
,
to
a
certain
club
-
room
hard
by
the
Bank
,
where
quartettes
of
the
most
tormenting
and
excruciating
nature
were
executed
every
Wednesday
evening
by
a
private
party
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
was
a
gentleman
thirty
-
eight
or
forty
years
old
,
of
a
florid
complexion
,
and
with
two
unbroken
rows
of
glistening
teeth
,
whose
regularity
and
whiteness
were
quite
distressing
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
escape
the
observation
of
them
,
for
he
showed
them
whenever
he
spoke
;
and
bore
so
wide
a
smile
upon
his
countenance
(
a
smile
,
however
,
very
rarely
,
indeed
,
extending
beyond
his
mouth
)
,
that
there
was
something
in
it
like
the
snarl
of
a
cat
.
<EOS>
He
affected
a
stiff
white
cravat
,
after
the
example
of
his
principal
,
and
was
always
closely
buttoned
up
and
tightly
dressed
.
<EOS>
His
manner
towards
Mr
Dombey
was
deeply
conceived
and
perfectly
expressed
.
<EOS>
He
was
familiar
with
him
,
in
the
very
extremity
of
his
sense
of
the
distance
between
them
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
to
a
man
in
your
position
from
a
man
in
mine
,
there
is
no
show
of
subservience
compatible
with
the
transaction
of
business
between
us
,
that
I
should
think
sufficient
.
<EOS>
I
frankly
tell
you
,
Sir
,
I
give
it
up
altogether
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
could
not
satisfy
my
own
mind
;
and
Heaven
knows
,
Mr
Dombey
,
you
can
afford
to
dispense
with
the
endeavour
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
had
carried
these
words
about
with
him
,
printed
on
a
placard
,
and
had
constantly
offered
it
to
Mr
Dombey
's
perusal
on
the
breast
of
his
coat
,
he
could
not
have
been
more
explicit
than
he
was
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
Carker
the
Manager
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
the
Junior
,
Walter
's
friend
,
was
his
brother
;
two
or
three
years
older
than
he
,
but
widely
removed
in
station
.
<EOS>
The
younger
brother
's
post
was
on
the
top
of
the
official
ladder
;
the
elder
brother
's
at
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
The
elder
brother
never
gained
a
stave
,
or
raised
his
foot
to
mount
one
.
<EOS>
Young
men
passed
above
his
head
,
and
rose
and
rose
;
but
he
was
always
at
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
He
was
quite
resigned
to
occupy
that
low
conditions
:
never
complained
of
it
:
and
certainly
never
hoped
to
escape
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
this
morning
?
"
said
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
,
entering
Mr
Dombey
's
room
soon
after
his
arrival
one
day
:
with
a
bundle
of
papers
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Carker
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
rising
from
his
chair
,
and
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
anything
there
for
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
I
need
trouble
you
,
"
returned
Carker
,
turning
over
the
papers
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
committee
to
-
day
at
three
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
one
at
three
,
three
-
quarters
,
"
added
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Catch
you
forgetting
anything
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Carker
,
still
turning
over
his
papers
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
Mr
Paul
inherits
your
memory
,
he
'll
be
a
troublesome
customer
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
One
of
you
is
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
an
accurate
memory
of
your
own
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
I
!
"
returned
the
manager
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
only
capital
of
a
man
like
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
did
not
look
less
pompous
or
at
all
displeased
,
as
he
stood
leaning
against
the
chimneypiece
,
surveying
his
(
of
course
unconscious
)
clerk
,
from
head
to
foot
.
<EOS>
The
stiffness
and
nicety
of
Mr
Carker
's
dress
,
and
a
certain
arrogance
of
manner
,
either
natural
to
him
or
imitated
from
a
pattern
not
far
off
,
gave
great
additional
effect
to
his
humility
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
a
man
who
would
contend
against
the
power
that
vanquished
him
,
if
he
could
,
but
who
was
utterly
borne
down
by
the
greatness
and
superiority
of
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Morfin
here
?
"
asked
Mr
Dombey
after
a
short
pause
,
during
which
Mr
Carker
had
been
fluttering
his
papers
,
and
muttering
little
abstracts
of
their
contents
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Morfin
's
here
,
"
he
answered
,
looking
up
with
his
widest
and
most
sudden
smile
;

humming
musical
recollections
---
of
his
last
night
's
quartette
party
,
I
suppose
---
through
the
walls
between
us
and
driving
me
half
mad
.
<EOS>
I
wish
he
'd
make
a
bonfire
of
his
violoncello
,
and
burn
his
music
-
books
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
respect
nobody
,
Carker
,
I
think
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Carker
,
with
another
wide
and
most
feline
show
of
his
teeth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Not
many
people
<EOS>
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
answer
perhaps
,
"
he
murmured
,
as
if
he
were
only
thinking
it
,
"
for
more
than
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
dangerous
quality
,
if
real
;
and
a
not
less
dangerous
one
,
if
feigned
.
<EOS>
But
Mr
Dombey
hardly
seemed
to
think
so
,
as
he
still
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
drawn
up
to
his
full
height
,
and
looking
at
his
head
-
clerk
with
a
dignified
composure
,
in
which
there
seemed
to
lurk
a
stronger
latent
sense
of
power
than
usual
.
  
<EOS>
"
Talking
of
Morfin
,
"
resumed
Mr
Carker
,
taking
out
one
paper
from
the
rest
,
"
he
reports
a
junior
dead
in
the
agency
at
Barbados
,
and
purposes
to
reserve
a
passage
in
the
Son
and
Heir
<EOS>
---
she
'll
sail
in
a
month
or
so
---
for
the
successor
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
care
who
goes
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
We
have
nobody
of
that
sort
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
shook
his
head
with
supreme
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
very
precious
appointment
,
"
observed
Mr
Carker
,
taking
up
a
pen
,
with
which
to
endorse
a
memorandum
on
the
back
of
the
paper
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
may
bestow
it
on
some
orphan
nephew
of
a
musical
friend
.
<EOS>
It
may
perhaps
stop
his
fiddle
-
playing
,
if
he
has
a
gift
that
way
.
<EOS>
Who
's
that
?
<EOS>
Come
in
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr
Carker
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
you
were
here
,
Sir
,
"
answered
Walter
,
appearing
with
some
letters
in
his
hand
,
unopened
,
and
newly
arrived
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
the
Junior
,
Sir
---
"
  
At
the
mention
of
this
name
,
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
was
,
or
affected
to
be
touched
to
the
quick
with
shame
and
humiliation
.
<EOS>
He
cast
his
eyes
full
on
Mr
Dombey
with
an
altered
and
apologetic
look
,
abased
them
on
the
ground
,
and
remained
for
a
moment
without
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
Sir
,
"
he
said
suddenly
and
angrily
,
turning
on
Walter
,
"
that
you
had
been
before
requested
not
to
drag
Mr
Carker
the
Junior
into
your
conversation
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
returned
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
only
going
to
say
that
Mr
Carker
the
Junior
had
told
me
he
believed
you
were
gone
out
,
or
I
should
not
have
knocked
at
the
door
when
you
were
engaged
with
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
These
are
letters
for
Mr
Dombey
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
well
,
Sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
,
plucking
them
sharply
from
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Go
about
your
business
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
in
taking
them
with
so
little
ceremony
,
Mr
Carker
dropped
one
on
the
floor
,
and
did
not
see
what
he
had
done
;
neither
did
Mr
Dombey
observe
the
letter
lying
near
his
feet
.
<EOS>
Walter
hesitated
for
a
moment
,
thinking
that
one
or
other
of
them
would
notice
it
;
but
finding
that
neither
did
,
he
stopped
.
<EOS>
came
back
,
picked
it
up
,
and
laid
it
himself
on
Mr
Dombey
's
desk
.
<EOS>
The
letters
were
post
-
letters
;
and
it
happened
that
the
one
in
question
was
Mrs
Pipchin
's
regular
report
,
directed
as
usual
---
for
Mrs
Pipchin
was
but
an
indifferent
penwoman
---
by
Florence
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
having
his
attention
silently
called
to
this
letter
by
Walter
,
started
,
and
looked
fiercely
at
him
,
as
if
he
believed
that
he
had
purposely
selected
it
from
all
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
leave
the
room
,
Sir
!
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
haughtily
.
  
<EOS>
He
crushed
the
letter
in
his
hand
;
and
having
watched
Walter
out
at
the
door
,
put
it
in
his
pocket
without
breaking
the
seal
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
somebody
to
send
to
the
West
Indies
,
you
were
saying
,
"
observed
Mr
Dombey
,
hurriedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Send
young
Gay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
,
very
good
indeed
.
<EOS>
Nothing
easier
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
without
any
show
of
surprise
,
and
taking
up
the
pen
to
reendorse
the
letter
,
as
coolly
as
he
had
done
before
.
"
<EOS>
"
Send
young
Gay
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Call
him
back
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
was
quick
to
do
so
,
and
Walter
was
quick
to
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gay
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
turning
a
little
to
look
at
him
over
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
Here
is
a
---
"
  
"
An
opening
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
with
his
mouth
stretched
to
the
utmost
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
West
Indies
.
<EOS>
At
Barbados
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
send
you
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
scorning
to
embellish
the
bare
truth
,
"
to
fill
a
junior
situation
in
the
counting
-
house
at
Barbados
.
<EOS>
Let
your
uncle
know
from
me
,
that
I
have
chosen
you
to
go
to
the
West
Indies
.
"
  
<EOS>
Walter
's
breath
was
so
completely
taken
away
by
his
astonishment
,
that
he
could
hardly
find
enough
for
the
repetition
of
the
words
"
West
Indies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Somebody
must
go
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
and
you
are
young
and
healthy
,
and
your
uncle
's
circumstances
are
not
good
.
<EOS>
Tell
your
uncle
that
you
are
appointed
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
go
yet
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
an
interval
of
a
month
---
or
two
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
remain
there
,
Sir
?
"
inquired
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
remain
there
,
Sir
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Mr
Dombey
,
turning
a
little
more
round
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
What
does
he
mean
,
Carker
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Live
there
,
Sir
,
"
faltered
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
returned
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
Walter
bowed
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
resuming
his
letters
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
explain
to
him
in
good
time
about
the
usual
outfit
and
so
forth
,
Carker
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
He
need
n't
wait
,
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
wait
,
Gay
,
"
observed
Mr
Carker
:
bare
to
the
gums
.
  
<EOS>
"
Unless
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
stopping
in
his
reading
without
looking
off
the
letter
,
and
seeming
to
listen
.
<EOS>
"
Unless
he
has
anything
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
Sir
,
"
returned
Walter
,
agitated
and
confused
,
and
almost
stunned
,
as
an
infinite
variety
of
pictures
presented
themselves
to
his
mind
;
among
which
Captain
Cuttle
,
in
his
glazed
hat
,
transfixed
with
astonishment
at
Mrs
MacStinger
's
,
and
his
uncle
bemoaning
his
loss
in
the
little
back
parlour
,
held
prominent
places
.
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
---
I
---
I
am
much
obliged
,
Sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
need
n't
wait
,
Carker
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
And
as
Mr
Carker
again
echoed
the
words
,
and
also
collected
his
papers
as
if
he
were
going
away
too
,
Walter
felt
that
his
lingering
any
longer
would
be
an
unpardonable
intrusion
---
especially
as
he
had
nothing
to
say
---
and
therefore
walked
out
quite
confounded
.
  
<EOS>
Going
along
the
passage
,
with
the
mingled
consciousness
and
helplessness
of
a
dream
,
he
heard
Mr
Dombey
's
door
shut
again
,
as
Mr
Carker
came
out
:
and
immediately
afterwards
that
gentleman
called
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bring
your
friend
Mr
Carker
the
Junior
to
my
room
,
Sir
,
if
you
please
.
"
  
<EOS>
Walter
went
to
the
outer
office
and
apprised
Mr
Carker
the
Junior
of
his
errand
,
who
accordingly
came
out
from
behind
a
partition
where
he
sat
alone
in
one
corner
,
and
returned
with
him
to
the
room
of
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
.
  
<EOS>
That
gentleman
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
and
his
hands
under
his
coat
-
tails
,
looking
over
his
white
cravat
,
as
unpromisingly
as
Mr
Dombey
himself
could
have
looked
.
<EOS>
He
received
them
without
any
change
in
his
attitude
or
softening
of
his
harsh
and
black
expression
:
merely
signing
to
Walter
to
close
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
John
Carker
,
"
said
the
Manager
,
when
this
was
done
,
turning
suddenly
upon
his
brother
,
with
his
two
rows
of
teeth
bristling
as
if
he
would
have
bitten
him
,
"
what
is
the
league
between
you
and
his
young
man
,
in
virtue
of
which
I
am
haunted
and
hunted
by
the
mention
of
your
name
?
<EOS>
Is
it
not
enough
for
you
,
John
Carker
,
that
I
am
your
near
relation
,
and
ca
n't
detach
myself
from
that
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
Say
disgrace
,
James
,
"
interposed
the
other
in
a
low
voice
,
finding
that
he
stammered
for
a
word
.
<EOS>
"
You
mean
it
,
and
have
reason
,
say
disgrace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
From
that
disgrace
,
"
assented
his
brother
with
keen
emphasis
,
"
but
is
the
fact
to
be
blurted
out
and
trumpeted
,
and
proclaimed
continually
in
the
presence
of
the
very
House
!
<EOS>
In
moments
of
confidence
too
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
your
name
is
calculated
harmonise
in
this
place
with
trust
and
confidence
,
John
Carker
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returned
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
James
.
<EOS>
God
knows
I
have
no
such
thought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
thought
,
then
?
"
said
his
brother
,
"
and
why
do
you
thrust
yourself
in
my
way
?
<EOS>
Have
n't
you
injured
me
enough
already
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
injured
you
,
James
,
wilfully
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
my
brother
,
"
said
the
Manager
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
injury
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
undo
it
,
James
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
could
and
would
.
"
  
<EOS>
During
this
conversation
,
Walter
had
looked
from
one
brother
to
the
other
,
with
pain
and
amazement
.
<EOS>
He
who
was
the
Senior
in
years
,
and
Junior
in
the
house
,
stood
,
with
his
eyes
cast
upon
the
ground
,
and
his
head
bowed
,
humbly
listening
to
the
reproaches
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
Though
these
were
rendered
very
bitter
by
the
tone
and
look
with
which
they
were
accompanied
,
and
by
the
presence
of
Walter
whom
they
so
much
surprised
and
shocked
,
he
entered
no
other
protest
against
them
than
by
slightly
raising
his
right
hand
in
a
deprecatory
manner
,
as
if
he
would
have
said
,
"
Spare
me
!
"
<EOS>
So
,
had
they
been
blows
,
and
he
a
brave
man
,
under
strong
constraint
,
and
weakened
by
bodily
suffering
,
he
might
have
stood
before
the
executioner
.
  
<EOS>
Generous
and
quick
in
all
his
emotions
,
and
regarding
himself
as
the
innocent
occasion
of
these
taunts
,
Walter
now
struck
in
,
with
all
the
earnestness
he
felt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Carker
,
"
he
said
,
addressing
himself
to
the
Manager
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
indeed
,
this
is
my
fault
solely
.
<EOS>
In
a
kind
of
heedlessness
,
for
which
I
can
not
blame
myself
enough
,
I
have
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
mentioned
Mr
Carker
the
Junior
much
oftener
than
was
necessary
;
and
have
allowed
his
name
sometimes
to
slip
through
my
lips
,
when
it
was
against
your
express
wish
.
<EOS>
But
it
has
been
my
own
mistake
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
We
have
never
exchanged
one
word
upon
the
subject
---
very
few
,
indeed
,
on
any
subject
.
<EOS>
And
it
has
not
been
,
"
added
Walter
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
"
all
heedlessness
on
my
part
,
Sir
;
for
I
have
felt
an
interest
in
Mr
Carker
ever
since
I
have
been
here
,
and
have
hardly
been
able
to
help
speaking
of
him
sometimes
,
when
I
have
thought
of
him
so
much
!
"
  
<EOS>
Walter
said
this
from
his
soul
,
and
with
the
very
breath
of
honour
.
<EOS>
For
he
looked
upon
the
bowed
head
,
and
the
downcast
eyes
,
and
upraised
hand
,
and
thought
,
"
I
have
felt
it
;
and
why
should
I
not
avow
it
in
behalf
of
this
unfriended
,
broken
man
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
truth
,
you
have
avoided
me
,
Mr
Carker
,
"
said
Walter
,
with
the
tears
rising
to
his
eyes
;
so
true
was
his
compassion
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
to
my
disappointment
and
regret
.
<EOS>
When
I
first
came
here
,
and
ever
since
,
I
am
sure
I
have
tried
to
be
as
much
your
friend
,
as
one
of
my
age
could
presume
to
be
;
but
it
has
been
of
no
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
observe
,
"
said
the
Manager
,
taking
him
up
quickly
,
"
it
will
be
of
still
less
use
,
<EOS>
Gay
,
if
you
persist
in
forcing
Mr
John
Carker
's
name
on
people
's
attention
.
<EOS>
That
is
not
the
way
to
befriend
Mr
John
Carker
.
<EOS>
Ask
him
if
he
thinks
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
no
service
to
me
,
"
said
the
brother
.
<EOS>
"
It
only
leads
to
such
a
conversation
as
the
present
,
which
I
need
not
say
I
could
have
well
spared
.
<EOS>
No
one
can
be
a
better
friend
to
me
:
"
he
spoke
here
very
distinctly
,
as
if
he
would
impress
it
upon
Walter
:
"
than
in
forgetting
me
,
and
leaving
me
to
go
my
way
,
unquestioned
and
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
memory
not
being
retentive
,
Gay
,
of
what
you
are
told
by
others
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
,
warming
himself
with
great
and
increased
satisfaction
,
"
I
thought
it
well
that
you
should
be
told
this
from
the
best
authority
,
"
nodding
towards
his
brother
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
likely
to
forget
it
now
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
That
's
all
,
Gay
.
<EOS>
You
can
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
Walter
passed
out
at
the
door
,
and
was
about
to
close
it
after
him
,
when
,
hearing
the
voice
of
the
brothers
again
,
and
also
the
mention
of
his
own
name
,
he
stood
irresolutely
,
with
his
hand
upon
the
lock
,
and
the
door
ajar
,
uncertain
whether
to
return
or
go
away
.
<EOS>
In
this
position
he
could
not
help
overhearing
what
followed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Think
of
me
more
leniently
,
if
you
can
,
James
,
"
said
John
Carker
,
"
when
I
tell
you
I
have
had
---
how
could
I
help
having
,
with
my
history
,
written
here
"
---
striking
himself
upon
the
breast
---
"
my
whole
heart
awakened
by
my
observation
of
that
boy
,
Walter
Gay
.
<EOS>
I
saw
in
him
when
he
first
came
here
,
almost
my
other
self
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
other
self
!
"
repeated
the
Manager
,
disdainfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
as
I
am
,
but
as
I
was
when
I
first
came
here
too
;
as
sanguine
,
giddy
,
youthful
,
inexperienced
;
flushed
with
the
same
restless
and
adventurous
fancies
;
and
full
of
the
same
qualities
,
fraught
with
the
same
capacity
of
leading
on
to
good
or
evil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
said
his
brother
,
with
some
hidden
and
sarcastic
meaning
in
his
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
strike
me
sharply
;
and
your
hand
is
steady
,
and
your
thrust
is
very
deep
,
"
returned
the
other
,
speaking
(
or
so
Walter
thought
)
as
if
some
cruel
weapon
actually
stabbed
him
as
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
"
I
imagined
all
this
when
he
was
a
boy
.
<EOS>
I
believed
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
truth
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
saw
him
lightly
walking
on
the
edge
of
an
unseen
gulf
where
so
many
others
walk
with
equal
gaiety
,
and
from
which
---
"
  
"
The
old
excuse
,
"
interrupted
his
brother
,
as
he
stirred
the
fire
.
"
<EOS>
So
many
.
<EOS>
Go
on
.
<EOS>
Say
,
so
many
fall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
From
which
ONE
traveller
fell
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
who
set
forward
,
on
his
way
,
a
boy
like
him
,
and
missed
his
footing
more
and
more
,
and
slipped
a
little
and
a
little
lower
,
and
went
on
stumbling
still
,
until
he
fell
headlong
and
found
himself
below
a
shattered
man
.
<EOS>
Think
what
I
suffered
,
when
I
watched
that
boy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
only
yourself
to
thank
for
it
,
"
returned
the
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
myself
,
"
he
assented
with
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
seek
to
divide
the
blame
or
shame
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
divided
the
shame
,
"
James
Carker
muttered
through
his
teeth
.
<EOS>
And
through
so
many
and
such
close
teeth
,
he
could
mutter
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
James
,
"
returned
his
brother
,
speaking
for
the
first
time
in
an
accent
of
reproach
,
and
seeming
,
by
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
to
have
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
,
"
I
have
been
,
since
then
,
a
useful
foil
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
trodden
on
me
freely
in
your
climbing
up
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
spurn
me
with
your
heel
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
silence
ensued
.
<EOS>
After
a
time
,
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
was
heard
rustling
among
his
papers
,
as
if
he
had
resolved
to
bring
the
interview
to
a
conclusion
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
his
brother
withdrew
nearer
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
watched
him
with
such
trembling
and
such
fear
,
as
was
some
little
punishment
to
me
,
until
he
passed
the
place
where
I
first
fell
;
and
then
,
though
I
had
been
his
father
,
I
believe
I
never
could
have
thanked
God
more
devoutly
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
dare
to
warn
him
,
and
advise
him
;
but
if
I
had
seen
direct
cause
,
I
would
have
shown
him
my
example
.
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
to
be
seen
speaking
with
him
,
lest
it
should
be
thought
I
did
him
harm
,
and
tempted
him
to
evil
,
and
corrupted
him
:
or
lest
I
really
should
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
such
contagion
in
me
;
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
Piece
out
my
history
,
in
connexion
with
young
Walter
Gay
,
and
what
he
has
made
me
feel
;
and
think
of
me
more
leniently
,
James
,
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
these
words
he
came
out
to
where
Walter
was
standing
.
<EOS>
He
turned
a
little
paler
when
he
saw
him
there
,
and
paler
yet
when
Walter
caught
him
by
the
hand
,
and
said
in
a
whisper
:
  
"
Mr
Carker
,
pray
let
me
thank
you
!
<EOS>
Let
me
say
how
much
I
feel
for
you
!
<EOS>
How
sorry
I
am
,
to
have
been
the
unhappy
cause
of
all
this
!
<EOS>
How
I
almost
look
upon
you
now
as
my
protector
and
guardian
!
<EOS>
How
very
,
very
much
,
I
feel
obliged
to
you
and
pity
you
!
"
said
Walter
,
squeezing
both
his
hands
,
and
hardly
knowing
,
in
his
agitation
,
what
he
did
or
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Morfin
's
room
being
close
at
hand
and
empty
,
and
the
door
wide
open
,
they
moved
thither
by
one
accord
:
the
passage
being
seldom
free
from
some
one
passing
to
or
fro
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
there
,
and
Walter
saw
in
Mr
Carker
's
face
some
traces
of
the
emotion
within
,
he
almost
felt
as
if
he
had
never
seen
the
face
before
;
it
was
so
greatly
changed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Walter
,
"
he
said
,
laying
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
far
removed
from
you
,
and
may
I
ever
be
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
what
I
am
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
you
are
!
"
appeared
to
hang
on
Walter
's
lips
,
as
he
regarded
him
attentively
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
begun
,
"
said
Carker
,
"
before
my
twenty
-
first
birthday
---
led
up
to
,
long
before
,
but
not
begun
till
near
that
time
.
<EOS>
I
had
robbed
them
when
I
came
of
age
.
<EOS>
I
robbed
them
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Before
my
twenty
-
second
birthday
,
it
was
all
found
out
;
and
then
,
Walter
,
from
all
men
's
society
,
I
died
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Again
his
last
few
words
hung
trembling
upon
Walter
's
lips
,
but
he
could
neither
utter
them
,
nor
any
of
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
House
was
very
good
to
me
.
<EOS>
May
Heaven
reward
the
old
man
for
his
forbearance
!
<EOS>
This
one
,
too
,
his
son
,
who
was
then
newly
in
the
firm
,
where
I
had
held
great
trust
!
<EOS>
I
was
called
into
that
room
which
is
now
his
---
I
have
never
entered
it
since
---
and
came
out
,
what
you
know
me
.
<EOS>
For
many
years
I
sat
in
my
present
seat
,
alone
as
now
,
but
then
a
known
and
recognised
example
to
the
rest
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
merciful
to
me
,
and
I
lived
.
<EOS>
Time
has
altered
that
part
of
my
poor
expiation
;
and
I
think
,
except
the
three
heads
of
the
House
,
there
is
no
one
here
who
knows
my
story
rightly
.
<EOS>
Before
the
little
boy
grows
up
,
and
has
it
told
to
him
,
my
corner
may
be
vacant
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
that
it
might
be
so
!
<EOS>
This
is
the
only
change
to
me
since
that
day
,
when
I
felt
all
youth
,
and
hope
,
and
good
men
's
company
,
behind
me
in
that
room
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
Walter
!
<EOS>
Keep
you
,
and
all
dear
to
you
,
in
honesty
,
or
strike
them
dead
!
"
  
<EOS>
Some
recollection
of
his
trembling
from
head
to
foot
,
as
if
with
excessive
cold
,
and
of
his
bursting
into
tears
,
was
all
that
Walter
could
add
to
this
,
when
he
tried
to
recall
exactly
what
had
passed
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
When
Walter
saw
him
next
,
he
was
bending
over
his
desk
in
his
old
silent
,
drooping
,
humbled
way
.
<EOS>
Then
,
observing
him
at
his
work
,
and
feeling
how
resolved
he
evidently
was
that
no
further
intercource
should
arise
between
them
,
and
thinking
again
and
again
on
all
he
had
seen
and
heard
that
morning
in
so
short
a
time
,
<EOS>
in
connexion
with
the
history
of
both
the
Carkers
,
Walter
could
hardly
believe
that
he
was
under
orders
for
the
West
Indies
,
and
would
soon
be
lost
to
Uncle
Sol
,
and
Captain
Cuttle
,
and
to
glimpses
few
and
far
between
of
Florence
Dombey
---
<EOS>
no
,
he
meant
Paul
---
<EOS>
and
to
all
he
loved
,
and
liked
,
and
looked
for
,
in
his
daily
life
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
true
,
and
the
news
had
already
penetrated
to
the
outer
office
;
for
while
he
sat
with
a
heavy
heart
,
pondering
on
these
things
,
and
resting
his
head
upon
his
arm
,
Perch
the
messenger
,
descending
from
his
mahogany
bracket
,
and
jogging
his
elbow
,
begged
his
pardon
,
but
wished
to
say
in
his
ear
,
Did
he
think
he
could
arrange
to
send
home
to
England
a
jar
of
preserved
Ginger
,
cheap
,
for
Mrs
Perch
's
own
eating
,
in
the
course
of
her
recovery
from
her
next
confinement

Home
for
the
Holidays
 
WHEN
the
Midsummer
vacation
approached
,
no
indecent
manifestations
of
joy
were
exhibited
by
the
leaden
-
eyed
young
gentlemen
assembled
at
Doctor
Blimber
's
.
<EOS>
Any
such
violent
expression
as
"
breaking
up
,
"
would
have
been
quite
inapplicable
to
that
polite
establishment
.
<EOS>
The
young
gentlemen
oozed
away
,
semi
-
annually
,
to
their
own
homes
;
but
they
never
broke
up
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
scorned
the
action
.
  
<EOS>
Tozer
,
who
was
constantly
galled
and
tormented
by
a
starched
white
cambric
neckerchief
,
which
he
wore
at
the
express
desire
of
Mrs
Tozer
,
his
parent
,
who
,
designing
him
for
the
Church
,
was
of
opinion
that
he
could
n't
be
in
that
forward
state
of
preparation
too
soon
---
Tozer
said
,
indeed
,
that
choosing
between
two
evils
<EOS>
,
he
thought
he
would
rather
stay
where
he
was
,
than
go
home
.
<EOS>
However
inconsistent
this
declaration
might
appear
with
that
passage
in
Tozer
's
Essay
on
the
subject
,
wherein
he
had
observed
"
that
the
thoughts
of
home
and
all
its
recollections
,
awakened
in
his
mind
the
most
pleasing
emotions
of
anticipation
and
delight
,
"
and
had
also
likened
himself
to
a
Roman
General
,
flushed
with
a
recent
victory
over
the
Iceni
,
or
laden
with
Carthaginian
spoil
,
advancing
within
a
few
hours
'
march
of
the
Capitol
,
presupposed
,
for
the
purposes
of
the
simile
,
to
be
the
dwelling
-
place
of
Mrs
Tozer
,
still
it
was
very
sincerely
made
.
<EOS>
For
it
seemed
that
Tozer
had
a
dreadful
uncle
,
who
not
only
volunteered
examinations
of
him
,
in
the
holidays
,
on
abstruse
points
,
but
twisted
innocent
events
and
things
,
and
wrenched
them
to
the
same
fell
purpose
.
<EOS>
So
that
if
this
uncle
took
him
to
the
Play
,
or
,
on
a
similar
pretence
of
kindness
,
carried
him
to
see
a
Giant
,
or
a
Dwarf
,
or
a
Conjuror
,
or
anything
,
Tozer
knew
he
had
read
up
some
classical
allusion
to
the
subject
before
-
hand
,
and
was
thrown
into
a
state
of
mortal
apprehension
:
not
foreseeing
where
he
might
break
out
,
or
what
authority
he
might
not
quote
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
Briggs
,
his
father
made
no
show
of
artifice
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
never
would
leave
him
alone
.
<EOS>
So
numerous
and
severe
were
the
mental
trials
of
that
unfortunate
youth
in
vacation
time
,
that
the
friends
of
the
family
(
then
resident
near
Bays
-
water
,
London
)
seldom
approached
the
ornamental
piece
of
water
in
Kensington
Gardens
,
without
a
vague
expectation
of
seeing
Master
Briggs
's
hat
floating
on
the
surface
,
and
an
unfinished
exercise
lying
on
the
bank
.
<EOS>
Briggs
,
therefore
,
was
not
at
all
sanguine
on
the
subject
of
holidays
;
and
these
two
sharers
of
little
Paul
's
bedroom
were
so
fair
a
sample
of
the
young
gentlemen
in
general
,
that
the
most
elastic
among
them
contemplated
the
arrival
of
those
festive
periods
with
genteel
resignation
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
far
otherwise
with
little
Paul
.
<EOS>
The
end
of
these
first
holidays
was
to
witness
his
separation
from
Florence
,
but
who
ever
looked
forward
to
the
end
of
holidays
whose
beginning
was
not
yet
come
!
<EOS>
Not
Paul
,
assuredly
.
<EOS>
As
the
happy
time
drew
near
,
the
lions
and
tigers
climbing
up
the
bedroom
walls
,
became
quite
tame
and
frolicsome
.
<EOS>
The
grim
sly
faces
in
the
squares
and
diamonds
of
the
floor
-
cloth
,
relaxed
and
peeped
out
at
him
with
less
wicked
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
grave
old
clock
had
more
of
personal
interest
in
the
tone
of
its
formal
inquiry
;
and
the
restless
sea
went
rolling
on
all
night
,
to
the
sounding
of
a
melancholy
strain
---
yet
it
was
pleasant
too
---
that
rose
and
fell
with
the
waves
,
and
rocked
him
,
as
it
were
,
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
,
seemed
to
think
that
he
,
too
,
would
enjoy
the
holidays
very
much

<EOS>
Mr
Toots
projected
a
life
of
holidays
from
that
time
forth
;
for
,
as
he
regularly
informed
Paul
every
day
,
it
was
his
"
last
half
"
at
Doctor
Blimber
's
,
and
he
was
going
to
begin
to
come
into
his
property
directly
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
perfectly
understood
between
Paul
and
Mr
Toots
,
that
they
were
intimate
friends
,
notwithstanding
their
distance
in
point
of
years
and
station
.
<EOS>
As
the
vacation
approached
,
and
Mr
Toots
breathed
harder
and
stared
oftener
in
Paul
's
society
,
than
he
had
done
before
,
Paul
knew
that
he
meant
he
was
sorry
they
were
going
to
lose
sight
of
each
other
,
and
felt
very
much
obliged
to
him
for
his
patronage
and
good
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
even
understood
by
Doctor
Blimber
,
Mrs
Blimber
,
and
Miss
Blimber
,
as
well
as
by
the
young
gentlemen
in
general
,
that
Toots
had
somehow
constituted
himself
protector
and
guardian
of
Dombey
,
and
the
circumstance
became
so
notorious
,
even
to
Mrs
Pipchin
,
that
the
good
old
creature
cherished
feelings
of
bitterness
and
jealousy
against
Toots
;
and
,
in
the
sanctuary
of
her
own
home
,
repeatedly
denounced
him
as
a
"
chuckle
-
headed
noodle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whereas
the
innocent
Toots
had
no
more
idea
of
awakening
Mrs
Pipchin
's
wrath
,
than
he
had
of
any
other
definite
possibility
or
proposition
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
he
was
disposed
to
consider
her
rather
a
remarkable
character
,
with
many
points
of
interest
about
her
.
<EOS>
For
this
reason
he
smiled
on
her
with
so
much
urbanity
,
and
asked
her
how
she
did
,
so
often
,
in
the
course
of
her
visits
to
little
Paul
,
that
at
last
she
one
night
told
him
plainly
,
she
was
n't
used
to
it
,
whatever
he
might
think
;
and
she
could
not
,
and
she
would
not
bear
it
,
either
from
himself
or
any
other
puppy
then
existing
:
<EOS>
at
which
unexpected
acknowledgment
of
his
civilities
,
Mr
Toots
was
so
alarmed
that
he
secreted
himself
in
a
retired
spot
until
she
had
gone
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
ever
again
face
the
doughty
Mrs
Pipchin
,
under
Doctor
Blimber
's
roof
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
within
two
or
three
weeks
of
the
holidays
,
when
,
one
day
,
Cornelia
Blimber
called
Paul
into
her
room
,
and
said
,
"
Dombey
,
I
am
going
to
send
home
your
analysis
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Ma'am
,
"
returned
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
I
mean
,
do
you
,
Dombey
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Miss
Blimber
,
looking
hard
at
him
through
the
spectacles
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Ma'am
,
"
said
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dombey
,
Dombey
,
"
said
Miss
Blimber
,
"
I
begin
to
be
afraid
you
are
a
sad
boy
.
<EOS>
When
you
do
n't
know
the
meaning
of
an
expression
,
why
do
n't
you
seek
for
information
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Pipchin
told
me
I
was
n't
to
ask
questions
,
"
returned
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
beg
you
not
to
mention
Mrs
Pipchin
to
me
,
on
any
account
,
Dombey
,
"
returned
Miss
Blimber
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
think
of
allowing
it
.
<EOS>
The
course
of
study
here
,
is
very
far
removed
from
anything
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
A
repetition
of
such
allusions
would
make
it
necessary
for
me
to
request
to
hear
,
without
a
mistake
,
before
breakfast
-
time
to
-
morrow
morning
,
from
Verbum
personale
down
to
simillima
cygno
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
,
Ma'am
---
"
began
little
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
trouble
you
not
to
tell
me
that
you
did
n't
mean
,
if
you
please
,
Dombey
,
"
said
Miss
Blimber
,
who
preserved
an
awful
politeness
in
her
admonitions
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
line
of
argument
I
could
n't
dream
of
permitting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Paul
felt
it
safest
to
say
nothing
at
all
,
so
he
only
looked
at
Miss
Blimber
's
spectacles
.
<EOS>
Miss
Blimber
having
shaken
her
head
at
him
gravely
,
referred
to
a
paper
lying
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Analysis
of
the
character
of
P
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
If
my
recollection
serves
me
,
"
said
Miss
Blimber
breaking
off
,
"
the
word
analysis
as
opposed
to
synthesis
,
is
thus
defined
by
Walker
.
<EOS>
"
The
resolution
of
an
object
,
whether
of
the
senses
or
of
the
intellect
,
into
its
first
elements
.
"
As
opposed
to
synthesis
,
you
observe
.
<EOS>
Now
you
know
what
analysis
is
,
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dombey
did
n't
seem
to
be
absolutely
blinded
by
the
light
let
in
upon
his
intellect
,
but
he
made
Miss
Blimber
a
little
bow
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Analysis
,
"
"
resumed
Miss
Blimber
,
casting
her
eye
over
the
paper
,
"
"
of
the
character
of
P
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
I
find
that
the
natural
capacity
of
Dombey
is
extremely
good
;
and
that
his
general
disposition
to
study
may
be
stated
in
an
equal
ratio
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
taking
eight
as
our
standard
and
highest
number
,
I
find
these
qualities
in
Dombey
stated
each
at
six
three
-
fourths
!
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Blimber
paused
to
see
how
Paul
received
this
news
.
<EOS>
Being
undecided
whether
six
three
-
fourths
meant
six
pounds
fifteen
,
or
sixpence
three
farthings
,
or
six
foot
three
,
or
three
quarters
past
six
,
or
six
somethings
that
he
had
n't
learnt
yet
,
with
three
unknown
something
elses
over
,
Paul
rubbed
his
hands
and
looked
straight
at
Miss
Blimber
.
<EOS>
It
happened
to
answer
as
well
as
anything
else
he
could
have
done
;
and
Cornelia
proceeded
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Violence
two
.
<EOS>
Selfishness
two
.
<EOS>
Inclination
to
low
company
,
as
evinced
in
the
case
of
a
person
named
Glubb
,
originally
seven
,
but
since
reduced
.
<EOS>
Gentlemanly
demeanour
four
,
and
improving
with
advancing
years
.
<EOS>
"
Now
what
I
particularly
wish
to
call
your
attention
to
,
Dombey
,
is
the
general
observation
at
the
close
of
this
analysis
.
"
  
<EOS>
Paul
set
himself
to
follow
it
with
great
care
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
It
may
be
generally
observed
of
Dombey
,
"
"
said
Miss
Blimber
,
<EOS>
reading
in
a
loud
voice
,
and
at
every
second
word
directing
her
spectacles
towards
the
little
figure
before
her
:
"
"
that
his
abilities
and
inclinations
are
good
,
and
that
he
has
made
as
much
progress
as
under
the
circumstances
could
have
been
expected
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
to
be
lamented
of
this
young
gentleman
that
he
is
singular
(
what
is
usually
termed
old
-
fashioned
)
in
his
character
and
conduct
,
and
that
without
presenting
anything
in
either
which
distinctly
calls
for
reprobation
,
he
is
often
very
unlike
other
young
gentlemen
of
his
age
and
social
position
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Dombey
,
"
said
Miss
Blimber
,
laying
down
the
paper
,
"
do
you
understand
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
do
,
Ma'am
,
"
said
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
analysis
,
you
see
,
Dombey
,
"
Miss
Blimber
continued
,
is
going
to
be
sent
home
to
your
respected
parent
.
<EOS>
It
will
naturally
be
very
painful
to
him
to
find
that
you
are
singular
in
your
character
and
conduct
.
<EOS>
It
is
naturally
painful
to
us
;
for
we
ca
n't
like
you
,
you
know
,
Dombey
,
as
well
as
we
could
wish
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
touched
the
child
upon
a
tender
point
.
<EOS>
He
had
secretly
become
more
and
more
solicitous
from
day
to
day
,
as
the
time
of
his
departure
drew
more
near
,
that
all
the
house
should
like
him
.
<EOS>
From
some
hidden
reason
,
very
imperfectly
understood
by
himself
---
if
understood
at
all
---
he
felt
a
gradually
increasing
impulse
of
affection
,
towards
almost
everything
and
everybody
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
to
think
that
they
would
be
quite
indifferent
to
him
when
he
was
gone
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
them
to
remember
him
kindly
;
and
he
had
made
it
his
business
even
to
conciliate
a
great
hoarse
shaggy
dog
,
chained
up
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
who
had
previously
been
the
terror
of
his
life
;
that
even
he
might
miss
him
when
he
was
no
longer
there
.
  
<EOS>
Little
thinking
that
in
this
,
he
only
showed
again
the
difference
between
himself
and
his
compeers
<EOS>
,
poor
tiny
Paul
set
it
forth
to
Miss
Blimber
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
begged
her
,
in
despite
of
the
official
analysis
,
to
have
the
goodness
to
try
and
like
him
.
<EOS>
To
Mrs
Blimber
,
who
had
joined
them
,
he
preferred
the
same
petition
:
and
when
that
lady
could
not
forbear
,
even
in
his
presence
,
from
giving
utterance
to
her
often
-
repeated
opinion
,
that
he
was
an
odd
child
,
Paul
told
her
that
he
was
sure
she
was
quite
right
;
that
he
thought
it
must
be
his
bones
,
but
he
did
n't
know
;
and
that
he
hoped
she
would
overlook
it
,
for
he
was
fond
of
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
so
fond
,
"
said
Paul
,
with
a
mixture
of
timidity
and
perfect
frankness
,
which
was
one
of
the
most
peculiar
and
most
engaging
qualities
of
the
child
,
"
not
so
fond
as
I
am
of
Florence
,
of
course
;
that
could
never
be
.
<EOS>
You
could
n't
expect
that
,
could
you
,
Ma'am
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
the
old
-
fashioned
little
soul
!
"
cried
Mrs
Blimber
,
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
like
everybody
here
very
much
,
"
pursued
Paul
,
"
and
I
should
grieve
to
go
away
,
and
think
that
any
one
was
glad
that
I
was
gone
,
or
did
n't
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Blimber
was
now
quite
sure
that
Paul
was
the
oddest
child
in
the
world
;
and
when
she
told
the
Doctor
what
had
passed
,
the
Doctor
did
not
controvert
his
wife
's
opinion
.
<EOS>
But
he
said
,
as
he
had
said
before
,
when
Paul
first
came
,
that
study
would
do
much
;
and
he
also
said
,
as
he
had
said
on
that
occasion
,
"
Bring
him
on
,
Cornelia
!
<EOS>
Bring
him
on
!
"
  
<EOS>
Cornelia
had
always
brought
him
on
as
vigorously
as
she
could
;
and
Paul
had
had
a
hard
life
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
over
and
above
the
getting
through
his
tasks
,
he
had
long
had
another
purpose
always
present
to
him
,
and
to
which
he
still
held
fast
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
to
be
a
gentle
,
useful
,
quiet
little
fellow
,
always
striving
to
secure
the
love
and
attachment
of
the
rest
;
and
though
he
was
yet
often
to
be
seen
at
his
old
post
on
the
stairs
,
or
watching
the
waves
and
clouds
from
his
solitary
window
,
he
was
oftener
found
,
too
,
among
the
other
boys
,
modestly
rendering
them
some
little
voluntary
service
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
came
to
pass
,
that
even
among
those
rigid
and
absorbed
young
anchorites
,
who
mortified
themselves
beneath
the
roof
of
Doctor
Blimber
,
Paul
was
an
object
of
general
interest
;
a
fragile
little
plaything
that
they
all
liked
,
and
that
no
one
would
have
thought
of
treating
roughly
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
change
his
nature
,
or
re
-
write
the
analysis
;
and
so
they
all
agreed
that
Dombey
was
old
-
fashioned
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
some
immunities
,
however
,
attaching
to
the
character
enjoyed
by
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
They
could
have
better
spared
a
newer
-
fashioned
child
,
and
that
alone
was
much
.
<EOS>
When
the
others
only
bowed
to
Doctor
Blimber
and
family
on
retiring
for
the
night
,
Paul
would
stretch
out
his
morsel
of
a
hand
,
and
boldly
shake
the
Doctor
's
;
also
Mrs
Blimber
's
;
also
Cornelia
's
.
<EOS>
If
anybody
was
to
be
begged
off
from
impending
punishment
,
Paul
was
always
the
delegate
.
<EOS>
The
weak
-
eyed
young
man
himself
had
once
consulted
him
,
in
reference
to
a
little
breakage
of
glass
and
china
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
darkly
rumoured
that
the
butler
,
regarding
him
with
favour
such
as
that
stern
man
had
never
shown
before
to
mortal
boy
,
had
sometimes
mingled
porter
with
his
table
-
beer
to
make
him
strong
.
  
<EOS>
Over
and
above
these
extensive
privileges
,
Paul
had
free
right
of
entry
to
Mr
Feeder
's
room
,
from
which
apartment
he
had
twice
led
Mr
Toots
into
the
open
air
in
a
state
of
faintness
,
consequent
on
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
smoke
a
very
blunt
cigar
:
one
of
a
bundle
which
that
young
gentleman
had
covertly
purchased
on
the
shingle
from
a
most
desperate
smuggler
,
who
had
acknowledged
,
in
confidence
,
that
two
hundred
pounds
was
the
price
set
upon
his
head
,
dead
or
alive
,
by
the
Custom
House
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
snug
room
,
Mr
Feeder
's
,
with
his
bed
in
another
little
room
inside
of
it
;
and
a
flute
,
which
Mr
Feeder
could
n't
play
yet
,
but
was
going
to
make
a
point
of
learning
,
he
said
,
hanging
up
over
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
There
were
some
books
in
it
,
too
,
and
a
fishing
-
rod
;
for
Mr
Feeder
said
he
should
certainly
make
a
point
of
learning
to
fish
,
when
he
could
find
time
.
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
had
amassed
,
with
similar
intentions
,
a
beautiful
little
curly
secondhand
key
-
bugle
,
a
chess
-
board
and
men
,
a
Spanish
Grammar
,
a
set
of
sketching
materials
,
and
a
pair
of
boxing
-
gloves
.
<EOS>
The
art
of
self
-
defence
Mr
Feeder
said
he
should
undoubtedly
make
a
point
of
learning
,
as
he
considered
it
the
duty
of
every
man
to
do
;
for
it
might
lead
to
the
protection
of
a
female
in
distress
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mr
Feeder
's
great
possession
was
a
large
green
jar
of
snuff
,
which
Mr
Toots
had
brought
down
as
a
present
,
at
the
close
of
the
last
vacation
;
and
for
which
he
had
paid
a
high
price
,
as
having
been
the
genuine
property
of
the
Prince
Regent
.
<EOS>
Neither
Mr
Toots
not
Mr
Feeder
could
partake
of
this
or
any
other
snuff
,
even
in
the
most
stinted
and
moderate
degree
,
without
being
seized
with
convulsions
of
sneezing
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
it
was
their
great
delight
to
moisten
a
box
-
full
with
cold
tea
,
stir
it
up
on
a
piece
of
parchment
with
a
paper
-
knife
,
and
devote
themselves
to
its
consumption
then
and
there
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
which
cramming
of
their
noses
,
they
endured
surprising
torments
with
the
constancy
of
martyrs
:
and
,
drinking
table
-
beer
at
intervals
,
felt
all
the
glories
of
dissipation
.
  
<EOS>
To
little
Paul
sitting
silent
in
their
company
,
and
by
the
side
of
his
chief
patron
,
Mr
Toots
,
there
was
a
dread
charm
in
these
reckless
occasions
:
and
when
Mr
Feeder
spoke
of
the
dark
mysteries
of
London
,
and
told
Mr
Toots
that
he
was
going
to
observe
it
himself
closely
in
all
its
ramifications
in
the
approaching
holidays
,
and
for
that
purpose
had
made
arrangements
to
board
with
two
old
maiden
ladies
at
Peckham
,
Paul
regarded
him
as
if
he
were
the
hero
of
some
book
of
travels
or
wild
adventure
,
and
was
almost
afraid
of
such
a
slashing
person
.
  
<EOS>
Going
into
this
room
one
evening
,
when
the
holidays
were
very
near
,
Paul
found
Mr
Feeder
filling
up
the
blanks
in
some
printed
letters
,
while
some
others
,
already
filled
up
and
strewn
before
him
,
were
being
folded
and
sealed
by
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
said
,
"
Aha
,
Dombey
,
there
you
are
,
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
---
for
they
were
always
kind
to
him
,
and
glad
to
see
him
---
and
then
said
,
tossing
one
of
the
letters
towards
him
,
"
<EOS>
And
there
you
are
,
too
,
Dombey
.
<EOS>
That
's
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mine
,
Sir
?
"
said
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
invitation
,
"
returned
Mr
Feeder
.
  
<EOS>
Paul
,
looking
at
it
,
found
,
in
copper
-
plate
print
,
with
the
exception
of
his
own
name
and
the
date
,
which
were
in
Mr
Feeder
's
Penmanship
,
that
Doctor
and
Mrs
Blimber
requested
the
pleasure
of
Mr
P
Dombey
's
company
at
an
early
party
on
Wednesday
Evening
the
Seventeenth
Instant
;
and
that
the
hour
was
half
-
past
seven
o'clock
;
and
that
the
object
was
Quadrilles
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
also
showed
him
,
by
holding
up
a
companion
sheet
of
paper
,
that
Doctor
and
Mrs
Blimber
requested
the
pleasure
of
Mr
Toots
's
company
at
an
early
party
on
Wednesday
Evening
the
Seventeenth
Instant
,
when
the
hour
was
half
-
past
seven
o'clock
,
and
when
the
object
was
Quadrilles
.
<EOS>
He
also
found
,
on
glancing
at
the
table
where
Mr
Feeder
sat
,
that
the
pleasure
of
Mr
Briggs
's
company
,
and
of
Mr
Tozer
's
company
,
and
of
every
young
gentleman
's
company
,
was
requested
by
Doctor
and
Mrs
Blimber
on
the
same
genteel
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
then
told
him
,
to
his
great
joy
,
that
his
sister
was
invited
,
and
that
it
was
a
half
-
yearly
event
,
and
that
,
as
the
holidays
began
that
day
,
he
could
go
away
with
his
sister
after
the
party
,
if
he
liked
,
which
Paul
interrupted
him
to
say
he
would
like
,
very
much
.
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
then
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
would
be
expected
to
inform
Doctor
and
Mrs
Blimber
,
in
superfine
small
-
hand
,
that
Mr
P
Dombey
would
be
happy
to
have
the
honour
of
waiting
on
them
,
in
accordance
with
their
polite
invitation
.
<EOS>
Lastly
,
Mr
Feeder
said
,
he
had
better
not
refer
to
the
festive
occasion
,
in
the
hearing
of
Doctor
and
Mrs
Blimber
;
as
these
preliminaries
,
and
the
whole
of
the
arrangements
,
were
conducted
on
principles
of
classicality
and
high
breeding
;
and
that
Doctor
and
Mrs
Blimber
on
the
one
hand
,
and
the
young
gentlemen
on
the
other
,
were
supposed
,
in
their
scholastic
capacities
,
not
to
have
the
least
idea
of
what
was
in
the
wind
.
  
<EOS>
Paul
thanked
Mr
Feeder
for
these
hints
,
and
pocketing
his
invitation
,
sat
down
on
a
stool
by
the
side
of
Mr
Toots
as
usual
.
<EOS>
But
Paul
's
head
,
which
had
long
been
ailing
more
or
less
,
and
was
sometimes
very
heavy
and
painful
,
felt
so
uneasy
that
night
,
that
he
was
obliged
to
support
it
on
his
hand
.
<EOS>
And
yet
it
dropped
so
,
that
by
little
and
little
it
sunk
on
Mr
Toots
's
knee
,
and
rested
there
,
as
if
it
had
no
care
to
be
ever
lifted
up
again
.
  
<EOS>
That
was
no
reason
why
he
should
be
deaf
,
but
he
must
have
been
,
he
thought
,
for
,
by
and
by
<EOS>
,
he
heard
Mr
Feeder
calling
in
his
ear
,
and
gently
shaking
him
to
rouse
his
attention
.
<EOS>
And
when
he
raised
his
head
,
quite
scared
,
and
looked
about
him
<EOS>
,
he
found
that
Doctor
Blimber
had
come
into
the
room
;
and
that
the
window
was
open
,
and
that
his
forehead
was
wet
with
sprinkled
water
;
though
how
all
this
had
been
done
without
his
knowledge
,
was
very
curious
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
Come
,
come
!
<EOS>
That
's
well
!
<EOS>
How
is
my
little
friend
now
?
"
said
Doctor
Blimber
,
encouragingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
quite
well
,
thank
you
,
Sir
,
"
said
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
seemed
to
be
something
the
matter
with
the
floor
,
for
he
could
n't
stand
upon
it
steadily
;
and
with
the
walls
too
,
for
they
were
inclined
to
turn
round
and
round
,
and
could
only
be
stopped
by
being
looked
at
very
hard
indeed
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
's
head
had
the
appearance
of
being
at
once
bigger
and
farther
off
than
was
quite
natural
:
and
when
he
took
Paul
in
his
arms
,
to
carry
him
up
stairs
,
Paul
observed
with
astonishment
that
the
door
was
in
quite
a
different
place
from
that
in
which
he
had
expected
to
find
it
,
and
almost
thought
,
at
first
,
that
Mr
Toots
was
going
to
walk
straight
up
the
chimney
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
very
kind
of
Mr
Toots
to
carry
him
to
the
top
of
the
house
so
tenderly
;
and
Paul
told
him
that
it
was
.
<EOS>
But
Mr
Toots
said
he
would
do
a
great
deal
more
than
that
,
if
he
could
;
and
indeed
he
did
more
as
it
was
:
for
he
helped
Paul
to
undress
,
and
helped
him
to
bed
,
in
the
kindest
manner
possible
,
and
then
sat
down
by
the
bedside
and
chuckled
very
much
;
while
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
,
leaning
over
the
bottom
of
the
bedstead
,
set
all
the
little
bristles
on
his
head
bolt
upright
with
his
bony
hands
,
and
then
made
believe
to
spar
at
Paul
with
great
science
,
on
account
of
his
being
all
right
again
,
which
was
so
uncommonly
facetious
,
and
kind
too
in
Mr
Feeder
,
that
Paul
,
not
being
able
to
make
up
his
mind
whether
it
was
best
to
laugh
or
cry
at
him
,
did
both
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
How
Mr
Toots
melted
away
,
and
Mr
Feeder
changed
into
Mrs
Pipchin
,
Paul
never
thought
of
asking
;
neither
was
he
at
all
curious
to
know
;
but
when
he
saw
Mrs
Pipchin
standing
at
the
bottom
of
the
bed
,
instead
of
Mr
Feeder
,
he
cried
out
,
"
Mrs
Pipchin
,
do
n't
tell
Florence
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
tell
Florence
<EOS>
what
,
my
little
Paul
?
"
said
Mrs
Pipchin
,
coming
round
to
the
bedside
,
and
sitting
down
in
the
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
About
me
,
"
said
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Mrs
Pipchin
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
I
mean
to
do
when
I
grow
up
,
Mrs
Pipchin
?
"
inquired
Paul
,
turning
his
face
towards
her
on
his
pillow
,
and
resting
his
chin
wistfully
on
his
folded
hands
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
could
n't
guess
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
"
said
Paul
,
"
to
put
my
money
all
together
in
one
Bank
,
never
try
to
get
any
more
,
go
away
into
the
country
with
my
darling
Florence
,
have
a
beautiful
garden
,
fields
,
and
woods
,
and
live
there
with
her
all
my
life
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
"
cried
Mrs
Pipchin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
I
mean
to
do
,
when
I
---
"
He
stopped
,
and
pondered
for
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
's
grey
eye
scanned
his
thoughtful
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
grow
up
,
"
said
Paul
.
<EOS>
Then
he
went
on
immediately
to
tell
Mrs
Pipchin
all
about
the
party
,
about
Florence
's
invitation
,
about
the
pride
he
would
have
in
the
admiration
that
would
be
felt
for
her
by
all
the
boys
,
about
their
being
so
kind
to
him
and
fond
of
him
,
about
his
being
so
fond
of
them
,
and
about
his
being
so
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
Then
he
told
Mrs
Pipchin
about
the
analysis
,
and
about
his
being
certainly
old
-
fashioned
,
and
took
Mrs
Pipchin
's
opinion
on
that
point
,
and
whether
she
knew
why
it
was
,
and
what
it
meant
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
denied
the
fact
altogether
,
as
the
shortest
way
of
getting
out
of
the
difficulty
;
but
Paul
was
far
from
satisfied
with
that
reply
,
and
looked
so
searchingly
at
Mrs
Pipchin
for
a
truer
answer
,
that
she
was
obliged
to
get
up
and
look
out
of
the
window
to
avoid
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
certain
calm
Apothecary
,
who
attended
at
the
establishment
when
any
of
the
young
gentlemen
were
ill
,
and
somehow
he
got
into
the
room
and
appeared
at
the
bedside
,
with
Mrs
Blimber
.
<EOS>
How
they
came
there
,
or
how
long
they
had
been
there
,
Paul
did
n't
know
;
but
when
he
saw
them
,
he
sat
up
in
bed
,
and
answered
all
the
Apothecary
's
questions
at
full
length
,
and
whispered
to
him
that
Florence
was
not
to
know
anything
about
it
,
if
he
pleased
,
and
that
he
had
set
his
mind
upon
her
coming
to
the
party
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
chatty
with
the
Apothecary
,
and
they
parted
excellent
friends
.
<EOS>
Lying
down
again
with
his
eyes
shut
,
he
heard
the
Apothecary
say
,
out
of
the
room
and
quite
a
long
way
off
---
or
he
dreamed
it
---
that
there
was
a
want
of
vital
power
(
what
was
that
,
Paul
wondered
)
and
great
constitutional
weakness
.
<EOS>
That
as
the
little
fellow
had
set
his
heart
on
parting
with
his
school
-
mates
on
the
seventeenth
,
it
would
be
better
to
indulge
the
fancy
if
he
grew
no
worse
.
<EOS>
That
he
was
glad
to
hear
from
Mrs
Pipchin
,
that
the
little
fellow
would
go
to
his
friends
in
London
on
the
eighteenth
.
<EOS>
That
he
would
write
to
Mr
Dombey
,
when
he
should
have
gained
a
better
knowledge
of
the
case
,
and
before
that
day
.
<EOS>
That
there
was
no
immediate
cause
for
---
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
Paul
lost
that
word
.
<EOS>
And
that
the
little
fellow
had
a
fine
mind
,
but
was
an
old
-
fashioned
boy
.
  
<EOS>
What
old
fashion
could
that
be
,
Paul
wondered
with
a
palpitating
heart
,
that
was
so
visibly
expressed
in
him
;
so
plainly
seen
by
so
many
people
!
  
<EOS>
He
could
neither
make
it
out
,
not
trouble
himself
long
with
the
effort
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
was
again
beside
him
,
if
she
had
ever
been
away
(
he
thought
she
had
gone
out
with
the
Doctor
,
but
it
was
all
a
dream
perhaps
)
,
and
presently
a
bottle
and
glass
got
into
her
hands
magically
,
and
she
poured
out
the
contents
for
him
.
<EOS>
After
that
,
he
had
some
real
good
jelly
,
which
Mrs
Blimber
brought
to
him
herself
;
and
then
he
was
so
well
,
that
Mrs
Pipchin
went
home
,
at
his
urgent
solicitation
,
and
Briggs
and
Tozer
came
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Poor
Briggs
grumbled
terribly
about
his
own
analysis
,
which
could
hardly
have
discomposed
him
more
if
it
had
been
a
chemical
process
;
but
he
was
very
good
to
Paul
,
and
so
was
Tozer
,
and
so
were
all
the
rest
,
for
they
everyone
looked
in
before
going
to
bed
,
and
said
,
"
How
are
you
now
,
Dombey
?
"
<EOS>
"
Cheer
up
,
little
Dombey
!
"
<EOS>
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
After
Briggs
had
got
into
bed
,
he
lay
awake
for
a
long
time
,
still
bemoaning
his
analysis
,
and
saying
he
knew
it
was
all
wrong
,
and
they
could
n't
have
analysed
a
murderer
worse
,
and
how
would
Doctor
Blimber
like
it
if
his
pocket
-
money
depended
on
it
?
<EOS>
It
was
very
easy
,
Briggs
said
,
to
make
a
galley
-
slave
of
a
boy
all
the
half
-
year
,
and
then
score
him
up
idle
;
and
to
crib
two
dinners
a
-
week
out
of
his
board
,
and
then
score
him
up
greedy
:
but
that
was
n't
going
to
be
submitted
to
,
he
believed
,
was
it
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
  
<EOS>
Before
the
weak
-
eyed
young
man
performed
on
the
gong
next
morning
,
he
came
up
stairs
to
Paul
and
told
him
he
was
to
lie
still
,
which
Paul
very
gladly
did
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
reappeared
a
little
before
the
Apothecary
,
and
a
little
after
the
good
young
woman
whom
Paul
had
seen
cleaning
the
stove
on
that
first
morning
(
how
long
ago
it
seemed
now
!
)
<EOS>
had
brought
him
his
breakfast
.
<EOS>
There
was
another
consultation
a
long
way
off
,
or
else
Paul
dreamed
it
again
;
and
then
the
Apothecary
,
coming
back
with
Doctor
and
Mrs
Blimber
,
said
:
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
think
,
Doctor
Blimber
,
we
may
release
this
young
gentleman
from
his
books
just
now
;
the
vacation
being
so
very
near
at
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
,
"
said
Doctor
Blimber
.
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
you
will
inform
Cornelia
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Assuredly
,
"
said
Mrs
Blimber
.
  
<EOS>
The
Apothecary
bending
down
,
looked
closely
into
Paul
's
eyes
,
and
felt
his
head
,
and
his
pulse
,
and
his
heart
,
with
so
much
interest
and
care
,
that
Paul
said
,
"
Thank
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Our
little
friend
,
"
observed
Doctor
Blimber
,
"
has
never
complained
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
!
"
replied
the
Apothecary
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
not
likely
to
complain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
find
him
greatly
better
?
"
said
Doctor
Blimber
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
he
is
greatly
better
,
Sir
,
"
returned
the
Apothecary
.
  
<EOS>
Paul
had
begun
to
speculate
,
in
his
own
odd
way
,
on
the
subject
that
might
occupy
the
Apothecary
's
mind
just
at
that
moment
;
so
musingly
had
he
answered
the
two
questions
of
Doctor
Blimber
.
<EOS>
But
the
Apothecary
happening
to
meet
his
little
patient
's
eyes
,
as
the
latter
set
off
on
that
mental
expedition
,
and
coming
instantly
out
of
his
abstraction
with
a
cheerful
smile
,
Paul
smiled
in
return
and
abandoned
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
lay
in
bed
all
that
day
,
dozing
and
dreaming
,
and
looking
at
Mr
Toots
:
but
got
up
on
the
next
,
and
went
down
stairs
.
<EOS>
Lo
and
behold
,
there
was
something
the
matter
with
the
great
clock
;
and
a
workman
on
a
pair
of
steps
had
taken
its
face
off
,
and
was
poking
instruments
into
the
works
by
the
light
of
a
candle
!
<EOS>
This
was
a
great
event
for
Paul
,
who
sat
down
on
the
bottom
stair
,
and
watched
the
operation
attentively
:
now
and
then
glancing
at
the
clock
face
,
leaning
all
askew
,
against
the
wall
hard
by
,
and
feeling
a
little
confused
by
a
suspicion
that
it
was
ogling
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
workman
on
the
steps
was
very
civil
;
and
as
he
said
,
when
he
observed
Paul
,
"
How
do
you
do
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
Paul
got
into
conversation
with
him
,
and
told
him
he
had
n't
been
quite
well
lately
.
<EOS>
The
ice
being
thus
broken
,
Paul
asked
him
a
multitude
of
questions
about
chimes
and
clocks
:
as
,
whether
people
watched
up
in
the
lonely
church
steeples
by
night
to
make
them
strike
,
and
how
the
bells
were
rung
when
people
dies
,
and
whether
those
were
different
bells
from
wedding
bells
,
or
only
sounded
dismal
in
the
fancies
of
the
living
.
<EOS>
Finding
that
his
new
acquaintance
was
not
very
well
informed
on
the
subject
of
the
Curfew
Bell
of
ancient
days
,
Paul
gave
him
an
account
of
that
institution
;
and
also
asked
him
,
as
a
practical
man
,
what
he
thought
about
King
Alfred
's
idea
of
measuring
time
by
the
burning
of
candles
;
to
which
the
workman
replied
,
that
he
thought
it
would
be
the
ruin
of
the
clock
trade
if
it
was
to
come
up
again
.
<EOS>
In
fine
,
Paul
looked
on
,
until
the
clock
had
quite
recovered
its
familiar
aspect
,
and
resumed
its
sedate
inquiry
:
when
the
workman
,
putting
away
his
tools
in
a
long
basket
,
bade
him
good
day
,
and
went
away
.
<EOS>
Though
not
before
he
had
whispered
something
,
on
the
door
-
mat
,
to
the
footman
,
in
which
there
was
the
phrase
"
old
-
fashioned
"
---
for
Paul
heard
it
.
  
<EOS>
What
could
that
old
fashion
be
,
that
seemed
to
make
the
people
sorry
!
<EOS>
what
could
it
be
!
  
<EOS>
Having
nothing
to
learn
now
,
he
thought
of
this
frequently
;
though
not
so
often
as
he
might
have
done
,
if
he
had
had
fewer
things
to
think
of
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
a
great
many
;
and
was
always
thinking
,
all
day
long
.
  
<EOS>
First
,
there
was
Florence
coming
to
the
party
.
<EOS>
Florence
would
see
that
the
boys
were
fond
of
him
;
and
that
would
make
her
happy
.
<EOS>
This
was
his
great
theme
.
<EOS>
Let
Florence
once
be
sure
that
they
were
gentle
and
good
to
him
,
and
that
he
had
become
a
little
favourite
among
them
,
and
then
she
would
always
think
of
the
time
he
had
passed
there
,
without
being
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
Florence
might
be
all
the
happier
too
for
that
perhaps
,
when
he
came
back
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
came
back
!
<EOS>
Fifty
times
a
day
,
his
noiseless
little
feet
went
up
the
stairs
to
his
own
room
,
as
he
collected
every
book
and
scrap
,
and
trifle
that
belonged
to
him
,
and
put
them
all
together
there
,
down
to
the
minutest
thing
,
for
taking
home!There
was
no
shade
of
coming
back
on
little
Paul
;
<EOS>
no
preparation
for
it
,
or
other
reference
to
it
,
grew
out
of
anything
he
thought
or
did
,
except
this
slight
one
in
connexion
with
his
sister
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
he
had
to
think
of
everything
familiar
to
him
,
in
his
contemplative
moods
and
in
his
wanderings
about
the
house
,
as
being
to
be
parted
with
;
and
hence
the
many
things
he
had
to
think
of
,
all
day
long
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
to
peep
into
those
rooms
up
-
stairs
,
and
think
how
solitary
they
would
be
when
he
was
gone
,
and
wonder
through
how
many
silent
days
,
weeks
,
months
,
and
years
,
they
would
continue
just
as
grave
and
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
He
had
to
think
---
would
any
other
child
(
old
-
fashioned
,
like
himself
)
stray
there
at
any
time
,
to
whom
the
same
grotesque
distortions
of
pattern
and
furniture
would
manifest
themselves
;
and
would
anybody
tell
that
boy
of
little
Dombey
,
who
had
been
there
once
?
  
<EOS>
He
had
to
think
of
a
portrait
on
the
stairs
,
which
always
looked
earnestly
after
him
as
he
went
away
,
eyeing
it
over
his
shoulder
:
and
which
,
when
he
passed
it
in
the
company
of
any
one
,
still
seemed
to
gaze
at
him
,
and
not
at
his
companion
.
<EOS>
He
had
much
to
think
of
,
in
association
with
a
print
that
hung
up
in
another
place
,
where
,
in
the
centre
of
a
wondering
group
,
one
figure
that
he
knew
,
a
figure
with
a
light
about
its
head
---
benignant
,
mild
,
and
merciful
---
stood
pointing
upward
.
  
<EOS>
At
his
own
bedroom
window
,
there
were
crowds
of
thoughts
that
mixed
with
these
,
and
came
on
,
one
upon
another
,
like
the
rolling
waves
.
<EOS>
Where
those
wild
birds
lived
,
that
were
always
hovering
out
at
sea
in
troubled
weather
;
where
the
clouds
rose
and
first
began
;
whence
<EOS>
the
wind
issued
on
its
rushing
flight
,
and
where
it
stopped
;
whether
the
spot
where
he
and
Florence
had
so
often
sat
,
and
watched
,
and
talked
about
these
things
,
could
ever
be
exactly
as
it
used
to
be
without
them
;
whether
it
could
ever
be
the
same
to
Florence
,
if
he
were
in
some
distant
place
,
and
she
were
sitting
there
alone
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
to
think
,
too
,
of
Mr
Toots
,
and
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
;
of
all
the
boys
;
and
of
Doctor
Blimber
,
Mrs
Blimber
,
and
Miss
Blimber
;
of
home
,
and
of
his
aunt
and
Miss
Tox
;
of
his
father
,
Dombey
and
Son
,
Walter
with
the
poor
old
uncle
who
had
got
the
money
he
wanted
,
and
that
gruff
-
voiced
Captain
with
the
iron
hand
.
<EOS>
Besides
all
this
,
he
had
a
number
of
little
visits
to
pay
,
in
the
course
of
the
day
;
to
the
schoolroom
,
to
Doctor
Blimber
's
study
,
to
Mrs
Blimber
's
private
a
apartment
,
to
Miss
Blimber
's
,
and
to
the
dog
.
<EOS>
For
he
was
free
of
the
whole
house
now
,
to
range
it
as
he
chose
;
and
,
in
his
desire
to
part
with
everybody
on
affectionate
terms
,
he
attended
,
in
his
way
,
to
them
all
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
found
places
in
books
for
Briggs
,
who
was
always
losing
them
;
sometimes
he
looked
up
words
in
dictionaries
for
other
young
gentlemen
who
were
in
extremity
;
sometimes
he
held
skeins
of
silk
for
Mrs
Blimber
to
wind
;
sometimes
he
put
Cornelia
's
desk
to
rights
;
sometimes
he
would
even
creep
into
the
Doctor
's
study
,
and
,
sitting
on
the
carpet
near
his
learned
feet
,
turn
the
globes
softly
,
and
go
round
the
world
,
or
take
a
flight
among
the
far
-
off
stars
.
  
<EOS>
In
those
days
immediately
before
the
holidays
,
in
short
,
when
the
other
young
gentlemen
were
labouring
for
dear
life
through
a
general
resumption
of
the
studies
of
the
whole
half
-
year
,
Paul
was
such
a
privileged
pupil
as
had
never
been
seen
in
that
house
before
.
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
believe
it
himself
;
but
his
liberty
lasted
from
hour
to
hour
,
and
from
day
to
day
;
and
little
Dombey
was
caressed
by
everyone
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Blimber
was
so
particular
about
him
,
that
he
requested
Johnson
to
retire
from
the
dinner
-
table
one
day
,
for
having
thoughtlessly
spoken
to
him
as
"
poor
little
Dombey
;
"
which
Paul
thought
rather
hard
and
severe
,
though
he
had
flushed
at
the
moment
,
and
wondered
why
Johnson
should
pity
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
more
questionable
justice
,
Paul
thought
,
in
the
Doctor
,
from
his
having
certainly
overheard
that
great
authority
give
his
assent
on
the
previous
evening
,
to
the
proposition
(
stated
by
Mrs
Blimber
)
that
poor
dear
little
Dombey
was
more
old
-
fashioned
than
ever
.
<EOS>
And
now
it
was
that
Paul
began
to
think
it
must
surely
be
old
-
fashioned
to
be
very
thin
,
and
light
,
and
easily
tired
,
and
soon
disposed
to
lie
down
anywhere
and
rest
;
for
he
could
n't
help
feeling
that
these
were
more
and
more
his
habits
every
day
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
the
party
-
day
arrived
;
and
Doctor
Blimber
said
at
breakfast
,
"
Gentlemen
,
we
will
resume
our
studies
on
the
twenty
-
fifth
of
next
month
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
immediately
threw
off
his
allegiance
,
and
put
on
his
ring
:
and
mentioning
the
Doctor
in
casual
conversation
shortly
afterwards
,
spoke
of
him
as
"
Blimber
!
"
<EOS>
This
act
of
freedom
inspired
the
older
pupils
with
admiration
and
envy
;
but
the
younger
spirits
were
appalled
,
and
seemed
to
marvel
that
no
beam
fell
down
and
crushed
him
.
  
<EOS>
Not
the
least
allusion
was
made
to
the
ceremonies
of
the
evening
,
either
at
breakfast
or
at
dinner
;
but
there
was
a
bustle
in
the
house
all
day
,
and
in
the
course
of
his
perambulations
,
Paul
made
acquaintance
with
various
strange
benches
and
candlesticks
,
and
met
a
harp
in
a
green
greatcoat
standing
on
the
landing
outside
the
drawing
-
room
door
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
queer
,
too
,
about
Mrs
Blimber
's
head
at
dinner
-
time
,
as
if
she
had
screwed
her
hair
up
too
tight
;
and
though
Miss
Blimber
showed
a
graceful
bunch
of
plaited
hair
on
each
temple
,
she
seemed
to
have
her
own
little
curls
in
paper
underneath
,
and
in
a
play
-
bill
too
:
for
Paul
read
"
Theatre
Royal
"
over
one
of
her
sparkling
spectacles
,
and
"
Brighton
"
over
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
grand
array
of
white
waistcoats
and
cravats
in
the
young
gentlemen
's
bedrooms
as
evening
approached
;
and
such
a
smell
of
singed
hair
,
that
Doctor
Blimber
sent
up
the
footman
with
his
compliments
,
and
wished
to
know
if
the
house
was
on
fire
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
only
the
hairdresser
curling
the
young
gentlemen
,
and
over
-
heating
his
tongs
in
the
ardour
of
business
.
  
<EOS>
When
Paul
was
dressed
---
which
was
very
soon
done
,
for
he
felt
unwell
and
drowsy
,
and
was
not
able
to
stand
about
it
very
long
---
he
went
down
into
the
drawing
-
room
;
where
he
found
Doctor
Blimber
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
full
dressed
,
but
with
a
dignified
and
unconcerned
demeanour
,
as
if
he
thought
it
barely
possible
that
one
or
two
people
might
drop
in
by
and
by
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
Mrs
Blimber
appeared
,
looking
lovely
,
Paul
thought
;
and
attired
in
such
a
number
of
skirts
that
it
was
quite
an
excursion
to
walk
round
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Blimber
came
down
soon
after
her
mama
;
a
little
squeezed
in
appearance
,
but
very
charming
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
and
Mr
Feeder
were
the
next
arrivals
.
<EOS>
Each
of
these
gentlemen
brought
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
as
if
he
lived
somewhere
else
;
and
when
they
were
announced
by
the
butler
,
Doctor
Blimber
said
,
"
Aye
,
aye
,
aye
!
<EOS>
God
bless
my
soul
!
"
and
seemed
extremely
glad
to
see
them
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
was
one
blaze
of
jewellery
and
buttons
:
and
he
felt
the
circumstance
so
strongly
,
that
when
he
had
shaken
hands
with
the
Doctor
,
and
had
bowed
to
Mrs
Blimber
and
Miss
Blimber
,
he
took
Paul
aside
,
and
said
,
"
What
do
you
think
of
this
,
Dombey
?
"
  
<EOS>
But
notwithstanding
this
modest
confidence
in
himself
,
Mr
Toots
appeared
to
be
involved
in
a
good
deal
of
uncertainty
whether
,
on
the
whole
,
it
was
judicious
to
button
the
bottom
button
of
his
waistcoat
,
and
whether
,
on
a
calm
revision
of
all
the
circumstances
,
it
was
best
to
wear
his
wristbands
turned
up
or
turned
down
.
<EOS>
Observing
that
Mr
Feeder
's
were
turned
up
,
Mr
Toots
turned
his
up
;
but
the
wristbands
of
the
next
arrival
being
turned
down
,
Mr
Toots
turned
his
down
.
<EOS>
The
differences
in
point
of
waistcoat
buttoning
,
not
only
at
the
bottom
,
but
at
the
top
too
,
became
so
numerous
and
complicated
as
the
arrivals
thickened
,
that
Mr
Toots
was
continually
fingering
that
article
of
dress
,
as
if
he
were
performing
on
some
instrument
;
and
appeared
to
find
the
incessant
execution
it
demanded
,
quite
bewildering
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
young
gentlemen
,
tightly
cravatted
,
curled
,
and
pumped
,
and
with
their
best
hats
in
their
hands
,
having
been
at
different
times
announced
and
introduced
,
Mr
Baps
,
the
dancing
-
master
,
came
,
accompanied
by
Mrs
Baps
,
to
whom
Mrs
Blimber
was
extremely
kind
and
condescending
.
<EOS>
Mr
Baps
was
a
very
gentleman
,
with
a
slow
and
measured
manner
of
speaking
;
and
before
he
had
stood
under
the
lamp
five
minutes
,
he
began
to
talk
to
Toots
(
who
had
been
silently
comparing
pumps
with
him
)
about
what
you
were
to
do
with
your
raw
materials
when
they
came
into
your
ports
in
return
for
your
drain
of
gold
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
to
whom
the
question
seemed
perplexing
,
suggested
"
Cook
'
em
.
"
<EOS>
But
Mr
Baps
did
not
appear
to
think
that
would
do
.
  
<EOS>
Paul
now
slipped
away
from
the
cushioned
corner
of
a
sofa
,
which
had
been
his
post
of
observation
,
and
went
down
stairs
into
the
tea
-
room
to
be
ready
for
Florence
,
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
nearly
a
fortnight
,
as
he
had
remained
at
Doctor
Blimber
's
on
the
previous
Saturday
and
Sunday
,
lest
he
should
take
cold
.
<EOS>
Presently
she
came
:
looking
so
beautiful
in
her
simple
ball
dress
,
with
her
fresh
flowers
in
her
hand
,
that
when
she
knelt
down
on
the
ground
to
take
Paul
round
the
neck
and
kiss
him
<EOS>
(
for
there
was
no
one
there
,
but
his
friend
and
another
young
woman
waiting
to
serve
out
the
tea
)
,
he
could
hardly
make
up
his
mind
to
let
her
go
again
,
or
to
take
away
her
bright
and
loving
eyes
from
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
is
the
matter
,
Floy
?
"
asked
Paul
,
almost
sure
that
he
saw
a
tear
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
darling
;
nothing
,
"
returned
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
Paul
touched
her
cheek
gently
with
his
finger
---
and
it
was
a
tear
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
Floy
!
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
'll
go
home
together
,
and
I
'll
nurse
you
,
love
,
"
said
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nurse
me
!
"
echoed
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
Paul
could
n't
understand
what
that
had
to
do
with
it
,
not
why
the
two
young
women
looked
on
so
seriously
,
nor
why
Florence
turned
away
her
face
for
a
moment
,
and
then
turned
it
back
,
lighted
up
again
with
smiles
.
  
<EOS>
"
Floy
,
"
said
Paul
,
holding
a
ringlet
of
her
dark
hair
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
dear
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
have
grown
old
-
fashioned
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
sister
laughed
,
and
fondled
him
,
and
told
him
"
No
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Because
I
know
they
say
so
,
"
returned
Paul
,
"
and
I
want
to
know
what
they
mean
,
Floy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
a
loud
double
knock
coming
at
the
door
,
and
Florence
hurrying
to
the
table
,
there
was
no
more
said
between
them
.
<EOS>
Paul
wondered
again
when
he
saw
his
friend
whisper
to
Florence
,
as
if
she
were
comforting
her
;
but
a
new
arrival
put
that
out
of
his
head
speedily
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
,
Lady
Skettles
,
and
Master
Skettles
.
<EOS>
Master
Skettles
was
to
be
a
new
boy
after
the
vacation
,
and
Fame
had
been
busy
,
in
Mr
Feeder
's
room
,
with
his
father
,
who
was
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
of
whom
Mr
Feeder
had
said
that
when
he
did
catch
the
Speaker
's
eye
(
which
he
had
been
expected
to
do
for
three
or
four
years
)
,
it
was
anticipated
that
he
would
rather
touch
up
the
Radicals
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
room
is
this
now
,
for
instance
?
"
said
Lady
Skettles
to
Paul
's
friend
,
'
Melia
.
  
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Blimber
's
study
,
ma'am
,
"
was
the
reply
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Skettles
took
a
panoramic
survey
of
it
through
her
glass
,
and
said
to
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
,
with
a
nod
of
approval
,
"
Very
good
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
assented
,
but
Master
Skettles
looked
suspicious
and
doubtful
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
this
little
creature
,
now
,
"
said
Lady
Skettles
,
turning
to
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
Is
he
one
of
the
---
"
  
"
Young
gentlemen
,
ma'am
;
yes
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Paul
's
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
your
name
,
my
pale
child
?
"
said
Lady
Skettles
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dombey
,
"
answered
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
immediately
interposed
,
and
said
that
he
had
had
the
honour
of
meeting
Paul
's
father
at
a
public
dinner
,
and
that
he
hoped
he
was
very
well
.
<EOS>
Then
Paul
heard
him
say
to
Lady
Skettles
,
"
City
---
very
rich
---
most
respectable
---
Doctor
mentioned
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
he
said
to
Paul
,
"
Will
you
tell
your
good
papa
that
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
rejoiced
to
hear
that
he
was
very
well
,
and
sent
him
his
best
compliments
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Sir
,
"
answered
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
my
brave
boy
,
"
said
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
.
<EOS>
"
Barnet
,
"
to
Master
Skettles
,
who
was
revenging
himself
for
the
studies
to
come
,
on
the
plum
-
cake
,
"
this
is
a
young
gentleman
you
ought
to
know
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
young
gentleman
you
may
know
,
Barnet
,
"
said
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
,
with
an
emphasis
on
the
permission
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
eyes
!
<EOS>
What
hair
!
<EOS>
What
a
lovely
face
!
"
exclaimed
Lady
Skettles
softly
,
as
she
looked
at
Florence
through
her
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
sister
,
"
said
Paul
,
presenting
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
satisfaction
of
the
Skettleses
was
now
complete
.
<EOS>
And
as
Lady
Skettles
had
conceived
,
at
first
sight
,
a
liking
for
Paul
,
they
all
went
up
stairs
together
:
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
taking
care
of
Florence
,
and
young
Barnet
following
.
  
<EOS>
Young
Barnet
did
not
remain
long
in
the
background
after
they
had
reached
the
drawing
-
room
,
for
Dr
Blimber
had
him
out
in
no
time
,
dancing
with
Florence
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
appear
to
Paul
to
be
particularly
happy
,
or
particularly
anything
but
sulky
,
or
to
care
much
what
he
was
about
;
but
as
Paul
heard
Lady
Skettles
say
to
Mrs
Blimber
,
while
she
beat
time
with
her
fan
,
that
her
dear
boy
was
evidently
smitten
to
death
by
that
angel
of
a
child
,
Miss
Dombey
,
it
would
seem
that
Skettles
Junior
was
in
a
state
of
bliss
,
without
showing
it
.
  
<EOS>
Little
Paul
thought
it
a
singular
coincidence
that
nobody
had
occupied
his
place
among
the
pillows
;
and
that
when
he
came
into
the
room
again
,
they
should
all
make
way
for
him
to
go
back
to
it
,
remembering
it
was
his
.
<EOS>
Nobody
stood
before
him
either
,
when
they
observed
that
he
liked
to
see
Florence
dancing
,
but
they
left
the
space
in
front
quite
clear
,
so
that
he
might
follow
her
with
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
They
were
so
kind
too
,
even
the
strangers
,
of
whom
there
were
soon
a
great
many
,
that
they
came
and
spoke
to
him
every
now
and
then
,
and
asked
him
how
he
was
,
and
if
his
head
ached
,
and
whether
he
was
tired
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
much
obliged
to
them
for
all
their
kindness
and
attention
,
and
reclining
propped
up
in
his
corner
,
with
Mrs
Blimber
and
Lady
Skettles
on
the
same
sofa
,
and
Florence
coming
and
sitting
by
his
side
as
soon
as
every
dance
was
ended
,
he
looked
on
very
happily
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
would
have
sat
by
him
all
night
,
and
would
not
have
danced
at
all
of
her
own
accord
,
but
Paul
made
her
,
by
telling
her
how
much
it
pleased
him
.
<EOS>
And
he
told
her
the
truth
,
too
;
for
his
small
heart
swelled
,
and
his
face
glowed
,
when
he
saw
how
much
they
all
admired
her
,
and
how
she
was
the
beautiful
little
rosebud
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
From
his
nest
among
the
pillows
,
Paul
could
see
and
hear
almost
everything
that
passed
,
as
if
the
whole
were
being
done
for
his
amusement
.
<EOS>
Among
other
little
incidents
that
the
observed
,
he
observed
Mr
Baps
the
dancing
-
master
get
into
conversation
with
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
,
and
very
soon
ask
him
,
as
he
had
asked
Mr
Toots
,
what
you
were
to
do
with
your
raw
materials
,
when
they
came
into
your
ports
in
return
for
your
drain
of
gold
---
which
was
such
a
mystery
to
Paul
that
he
was
quite
desirous
to
know
what
ought
to
be
done
with
them
.
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
had
much
to
say
upon
the
question
,
and
said
it
;
but
it
did
not
appear
to
solve
the
question
,
for
Mr
Baps
retorted
,
Yes
,
but
supposing
Russia
stepped
in
with
her
tallows
;
which
struck
Sir
Barnet
almost
dumb
,
for
he
could
only
shake
his
head
after
that
,
and
say
,
Why
then
you
must
fall
back
upon
your
cottons
,
he
supposed
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
looked
after
Mr
Baps
when
he
went
to
cheer
up
Mrs
Baps
<EOS>
(
who
,
being
quite
deserted
,
was
pretending
to
look
over
the
music
-
book
of
the
gentleman
who
played
the
harp
)
,
as
if
he
thought
him
a
remarkable
kind
of
man
;
and
shortly
afterwards
he
said
so
in
those
words
to
Doctor
Blimber
,
and
inquired
if
he
might
take
the
liberty
of
asking
who
he
was
,
and
whether
he
had
ever
been
in
the
Board
of
Trade
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Blimber
answered
no
,
he
believed
not
;
and
that
in
fact
he
was
a
Professor
of
---
   
"
Of
something
connected
with
statistics
,
I
'll
swear
?
"
<EOS>
observed
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
no
,
Sir
Barnet
,
"
replied
Doctor
Blimber
,
rubbing
his
chin
.
<EOS>
No
,
not
exactly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Figures
of
some
sort
,
I
would
venture
a
bet
,
"
said
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
yes
,
"
said
Doctor
Blimber
,
"
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
not
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
Mr
Baps
is
a
very
worthy
sort
of
man
,
Sir
Barnet
,
and
<EOS>
---
in
fact
he
's
our
professor
of
dancing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Paul
was
amazed
to
see
that
this
piece
of
information
quite
altered
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
'
opinion
of
Mr
Baps
,
and
that
Sir
Barnet
flew
into
a
perfect
rage
,
and
glowered
at
Mr
Baps
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
even
went
so
far
as
to
D
Mr
Baps
to
Lady
Skettles
,
in
telling
her
what
had
happened
,
and
to
say
that
it
was
like
his
most
con
-
sum
-
mate
and
confoun
-
ded
impudence
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
another
thing
that
Paul
observed
.
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
,
after
imbibing
several
custard
-
cups
of
negus
,
began
to
enjoy
himself
.
<EOS>
The
dancing
in
general
was
ceremonious
,
and
the
music
rather
solemn
---
a
little
like
church
music
in
fact
---
but
after
the
custard
---
cups
,
Mr
Feeder
told
Mr
Toots
that
he
was
going
to
throw
a
little
spirit
into
the
thing
.
<EOS>
After
that
,
Mr
Feeder
not
only
began
to
dance
as
if
he
meant
dancing
and
nothing
else
,
but
secretly
to
stimulate
the
music
to
perform
wild
tunes
.
<EOS>
Further
,
he
became
particular
in
his
attentions
to
the
ladies
;
and
dancing
with
Miss
Blimber
,
whispered
to
her
---
whispered
to
her
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
though
not
so
softly
<EOS>
but
that
Paul
heard
him
say
<EOS>
this
remarkable
poetry
,
  
"
Had
I
a
heart
for
falsehood
framed
,
I
ne'er
could
injure
You
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
Paul
heard
him
repeat
to
young
ladies
in
succession
.
<EOS>
Well
might
Mr
Feeder
say
to
Mr
Toots
,
that
he
was
afraid
he
should
be
the
worse
for
it
to
-
morrow
!
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Blimber
was
a
little
alarmed
by
this
---
comparatively
speaking
---
profligate
behaviour
;
and
especially
by
the
alteration
in
the
character
of
the
music
,
which
,
beginning
to
comprehend
low
melodies
that
were
popular
in
the
streets
,
might
not
unnaturally
be
supposed
to
give
offence
to
Lady
Skettles
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Skettles
was
so
very
kind
as
to
beg
Mrs
Blimber
not
to
mention
it
;
and
to
receive
her
explanation
that
Mr
Feeder
's
spirits
sometimes
betrayed
him
into
excesses
on
these
occasions
,
with
the
greatest
courtesy
and
politeness
;
observing
,
that
he
seemed
a
very
nice
sort
of
person
for
his
situation
,
and
that
she
particularly
liked
the
unassuming
style
of
his
hair
---
which
(
as
already
hinted
)
was
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
long
.
  
<EOS>
Once
,
when
there
was
a
pause
in
the
dancing
,
Lady
Skettles
told
Paul
that
he
seemed
very
fond
of
music
.
<EOS>
Paul
replied
,
That
he
was
;
and
if
she
was
too
,
she
ought
to
hear
his
sister
,
Florence
,
sing
.
<EOS>
Lady
Skettles
presently
discovered
that
she
was
dying
with
anxiety
to
have
that
gratification
;
and
though
Florence
was
at
first
very
much
frightened
at
being
asked
to
sing
before
so
many
people
,
and
begged
earnestly
to
be
excused
,
yet
,
on
Paul
calling
her
to
him
,
and
saying
,
"
Do
,
Floy!Please
!
<EOS>
For
me
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
went
straight
to
the
piano
,
and
began
.
<EOS>
When
they
all
drew
a
little
away
,
that
Paul
might
see
her
;
and
when
he
saw
her
sitting
there
all
alone
,
so
young
,
and
good
,
and
beautiful
,
and
kind
to
him
;
and
heard
her
thrilling
voice
,
so
natural
and
sweet
,
and
such
a
golden
link
between
him
and
all
his
life
's
love
and
happiness
,
rising
out
of
the
silence
;
he
turned
his
face
away
,
and
hid
his
tears
.
<EOS>
Not
,
as
he
told
them
when
they
spoke
to
him
,
not
that
the
music
was
too
plaintive
or
too
sorrowful
,
but
it
was
so
dear
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
loved
Florence
!
<EOS>
How
could
they
help
it
!
<EOS>
Paul
had
known
beforehand
that
they
must
and
would
;
and
sitting
in
his
cushioned
corner
,
with
calmly
folded
hands
,
and
one
leg
loosely
doubled
under
him
,
few
would
have
thought
what
triumph
and
delight
expanded
his
childish
bosom
while
he
watched
her
,
or
what
a
sweet
tranquillity
he
felt
.
<EOS>
Lavish
encomiums
on
"
Dombey
's
sister
"
reached
his
ears
from
all
the
boys
:
admiration
of
the
self
-
possessed
and
modest
little
beauty
was
on
every
lip
:
reports
of
her
intelligence
and
accomplishments
floated
past
him
,
constantly
;
and
,
as
if
borne
in
upon
the
air
of
the
summer
night
,
there
was
a
half
-
intelligible
sentiment
diffused
around
,
referring
to
Florence
and
himself
,
and
breathing
sympathy
for
both
,
that
soothed
and
touched
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
why
.
<EOS>
For
all
that
the
child
observed
,
and
felt
,
and
thought
,
that
night
---
the
present
and
the
absent
;
what
was
then
and
what
had
been
---
were
blended
like
the
colours
in
the
rainbow
,
or
in
the
plumage
of
rich
birds
when
the
sun
is
shining
on
them
,
or
in
the
softening
sky
when
the
same
sun
is
setting
.
<EOS>
The
many
things
he
had
had
to
think
of
lately
,
passed
before
him
in
the
music
;
not
as
claiming
his
attention
over
again
,
or
as
likely
evermore
to
occupy
it
,
but
as
peacefully
disposed
of
and
gone
.
<EOS>
A
solitary
window
,
gazed
through
years
ago
,
looked
out
upon
an
ocean
,
miles
and
miles
away
;
upon
its
waters
,
fancies
,
busy
with
him
only
yesterday
,
were
hushed
and
lulled
to
rest
like
broken
waves
.
<EOS>
The
same
mysterious
murmur
he
had
wondered
at
,
when
lying
on
his
couch
upon
the
beach
,
he
thought
he
still
heard
sounding
through
his
sister
's
song
,
and
through
the
hum
of
voices
,
and
the
tread
of
feet
,
and
having
some
part
in
the
faces
flitting
by
,
and
even
in
the
heavy
gentleness
of
Mr
Toots
,
who
frequently
came
up
to
shake
him
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
Through
the
universal
kindness
he
still
thought
he
heard
it
,
speaking
to
him
;
and
even
his
oldfashioned
reputation
seemed
to
be
allied
to
it
,
he
knew
not
how
.
<EOS>
Thus
little
Paul
sat
musing
,
listening
,
looking
on
,
and
dreaming
;
and
was
very
happy
.
  
<EOS>
Until
the
time
arrived
for
taking
leave
:
<EOS>
and
then
,
indeed
,
there
was
a
sensation
in
the
party
.
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
brought
up
Skettles
Junior
to
shake
hands
with
him
,
and
asked
him
if
he
would
remember
to
tell
his
good
papa
,
with
his
best
compliments
,
that
he
,
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
,
had
said
he
hoped
the
two
young
gentlemen
would
become
intimately
acquainted
.
<EOS>
Lady
Skettles
kissed
him
,
and
parted
his
hair
upon
his
brow
,
and
held
him
in
her
arms
;
and
even
Mrs
Baps
---
poor
Mrs
Baps
!
<EOS>
Paul
was
glad
of
that
---
came
over
from
beside
the
music
-
book
of
the
gentleman
who
played
the
harp
,
and
took
leave
of
him
quite
as
heartily
as
anybody
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
Doctor
Blimber
,
"
said
Paul
,
stretching
out
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
my
little
friend
,
"
returned
the
Doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
Sir
,
"
said
Paul
,
looking
innocently
up
into
his
awful
face
.
<EOS>
"
Ask
them
to
take
care
of
Diogenes
,
if
you
please
.
"
  
<EOS>
Diogenes
was
the
dog
:
who
had
never
in
his
life
received
a
friend
into
his
confidence
,
before
Paul
.
<EOS>
The
Doctor
promised
that
every
attention
should
be
paid
to
Diogenes
in
Paul
's
absence
,
and
Paul
having
again
thanked
him
,
and
shaken
hands
with
him
,
bade
adieu
to
Mrs
Blimber
and
Cornelia
with
such
heartfelt
earnestness
that
Mrs
Blimber
forgot
from
that
moment
to
mention
Cicero
to
Lady
Skettles
,
though
she
had
fully
intended
it
all
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Cornelia
,
taking
both
Paul
's
hands
in
hers
,
said
,
"
Dombey
,
Dombey
,
you
have
always
been
my
favourite
pupil
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
And
it
showed
,
Paul
thought
,
how
easily
one
might
do
injustice
to
a
person
;
for
Miss
Blimber
meant
it
---
though
she
was
a
Forcer
.
  
<EOS>
A
buzz
then
went
round
among
the
young
gentlemen
,
of
"
Dombey
's
going
!
"
<EOS>
"
Little
Dombey
's
going
!
"
<EOS>
and
there
was
a
general
move
after
Paul
and
Florence
down
the
staircase
and
into
the
hall
,
in
which
the
whole
Blimber
family
were
included
.
<EOS>
Such
a
circumstance
<EOS>
,
Mr
Feeder
said
aloud
,
as
had
never
happened
in
the
case
of
any
former
young
gentleman
within
his
experience
;
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
if
this
were
sober
fact
or
custard
-
cups
.
<EOS>
The
servants
,
with
the
butler
at
their
head
,
had
all
an
interest
in
seeing
Little
Dombey
go
;
and
even
the
weak
-
eyed
young
man
,
taking
out
his
books
and
trunks
to
the
coach
that
was
to
carry
him
and
Florence
to
Mrs
Pipchin
's
for
the
night
,
melted
visibly
.
  
<EOS>
Not
even
the
influence
of
the
softer
passion
on
the
young
gentlemen
---
and
they
all
,
to
a
boy
,
doated
on
Florence
---
could
restrain
them
from
taking
quite
a
noisy
leave
of
Paul
;
waving
hats
after
him
,
pressing
downstairs
to
shake
hands
with
him
,
crying
individually
"
Dombey
,
do
n't
forget
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
indulging
in
many
such
ebullitions
of
feeling
,
uncommon
among
those
young
Chesterfields
.
<EOS>
Paul
whispered
Florence
,
as
she
wrapped
him
up
before
the
door
was
opened
,
Did
she
hear
them
?
<EOS>
Would
she
ever
forget
it
?
<EOS>
Was
she
glad
to
know
it
?
<EOS>
And
a
lively
delight
was
in
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Once
,
for
a
last
look
,
he
turned
and
gazed
upon
the
faces
thus
addressed
to
him
,
surprised
to
see
how
shining
and
how
bright
,
and
numerous
they
were
,
and
how
they
were
all
piled
and
heaped
up
,
as
faces
are
at
crowded
theatres
.
<EOS>
They
swam
before
him
as
he
looked
,
like
faces
in
an
agitated
glass
;
and
next
moment
he
was
in
the
dark
coach
outside
,
holding
close
to
Florence
.
<EOS>
From
that
time
,
whenever
he
thought
of
Doctor
Blimber
's
,
it
came
back
as
he
had
seen
it
in
this
last
view
;
and
it
never
seemed
to
be
a
real
place
again
,
but
always
a
dream
,
full
of
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
not
quite
the
last
of
Doctor
Blimber
's
,
however
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
else
.
<EOS>
There
was
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
Who
,
unexpectedly
letting
down
one
of
the
coach
-
windows
,
and
looking
in
,
said
,
with
a
most
egregious
chuckle
,
"
Is
Dombey
there
?
"
and
immediately
put
it
up
again
,
without
waiting
for
an
answer
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
quite
the
last
of
Mr
Toots
,
even
;
for
before
the
coachman
could
drive
off
,
he
as
suddenly
let
down
the
other
window
,
and
looking
in
with
a
precisely
similar
chuckle
,
said
in
a
precisely
similar
tone
of
voice
,
"
Is
Dombey
there
?
"
and
disappeared
precisely
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
How
Florence
laughed
!
<EOS>
Paul
often
remembered
it
,
and
laughed
himself
whenever
he
did
so
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
much
,
soon
afterwards
---
next
day
,
and
after
that
---
which
Paul
could
only
recollect
confusedly
.
<EOS>
As
,
why
they
stayed
at
Mrs
Pipchin
's
days
and
nights
,
instead
of
going
home
;
why
he
lay
in
bed
,
with
Florence
sitting
by
his
side
;
whether
that
had
been
his
father
in
the
room
,
or
only
a
tall
shadow
on
the
wall
;
whether
he
had
heard
his
doctor
say
,
of
some
one
,
that
if
they
had
removed
him
before
the
occasion
on
which
he
had
built
up
fancies
,
strong
in
proportion
to
his
own
weakness
,
it
was
very
possible
he
might
have
pined
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
even
remember
whether
he
had
often
said
to
Florence
,
"
Oh
Floy
,
take
me
home
,
and
never
leave
me
!
"
<EOS>
but
he
thought
he
had
.
<EOS>
He
fancied
sometimes
he
had
heard
himself
repeating
,
"
Take
me
home
,
Floy
!
<EOS>
take
me
home
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
he
could
remember
,
when
he
got
home
,
and
was
carried
up
the
well
-
remembered
stairs
,
that
there
had
been
the
rumbling
of
a
coach
for
many
hours
together
,
while
he
lay
upon
the
seat
,
with
Florence
still
beside
him
,
and
old
Mrs
Pipchin
sitting
opposite
.
<EOS>
He
remembered
his
old
bed
too
,
when
they
laid
him
down
in
it
:
his
aunt
,
Miss
Tox
,
and
Susan
:
but
there
was
something
else
,
and
recent
too
,
that
still
perplexed
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
Florence
,
if
you
please
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
To
Florence
by
herself
,
for
a
moment
!
"
  
She
bent
down
over
him
,
and
the
others
stood
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Floy
,
my
pet
,
was
n't
that
Papa
in
the
hall
,
when
they
brought
me
from
the
coach
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dear
.
"
  
"
He
did
n't
cry
,
and
go
into
his
room
,
Floy
,
did
he
,
when
he
saw
me
coming
in
?
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
shook
her
head
,
and
pressed
her
lips
against
his
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
glad
he
did
n't
cry
,
"
said
little
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
he
did
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
tell
them
that
I
asked
.

Chapter
15
.
<EOS>
Amazing
Artfulness
of
Captain
Cuttle
,
and
a
new
Pursuit
for
Walter
Gay
 
<EOS>
WALTER
could
not
,
for
several
days
,
decide
what
to
do
in
the
Barbados
business
;
and
even
cherished
some
faint
hope
that
Mr
Dombey
might
not
have
meant
what
he
had
said
,
or
that
he
might
change
his
mind
,
and
tell
him
he
was
not
to
go
.
<EOS>
But
as
nothing
occurred
to
give
this
idea
(
which
was
sufficiently
improbable
in
itself
)
any
touch
of
confirmation
,
and
as
time
was
slipping
by
,
and
he
had
none
to
lose
,
he
felt
that
he
must
act
,
without
hesitating
any
longer
.
  
<EOS>
Walter
's
chief
difficulty
was
,
how
to
break
the
change
in
his
affairs
to
Uncle
Sol
,
to
whom
he
was
sensible
it
would
be
a
terrible
blow
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
greater
difficulty
in
dashing
Uncle
Sol
's
spirits
with
such
an
astounding
piece
of
intelligence
,
because
they
had
lately
recovered
very
much
,
and
the
old
man
had
become
so
cheerful
,
that
the
little
back
parlour
was
itself
again
.
<EOS>
Uncle
Sol
had
paid
the
first
appointed
portion
of
the
debt
to
Mr
Dombey
,
and
was
hopeful
of
working
his
way
through
the
rest
;
and
to
cast
him
down
afresh
,
when
he
had
sprung
up
so
manfully
from
his
troubles
,
was
a
very
distressing
necessity
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
it
would
never
do
to
run
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
must
know
of
it
beforehand
:
and
how
to
tell
him
was
the
point
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
question
of
going
or
not
going
,
Walter
did
not
consider
that
he
had
any
power
of
choice
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
had
truly
told
him
that
he
was
young
,
and
that
his
uncle
's
circumstances
were
not
good
;
and
Mr
Dombey
had
plainly
expressed
,
in
the
glance
with
which
he
had
accompanied
that
reminder
,
that
if
he
declined
to
go
he
might
stay
at
home
if
he
chose
,
but
not
in
his
counting
-
house
.
<EOS>
His
uncle
and
he
lay
under
a
great
obligation
to
Mr
Dombey
,
which
was
of
Walter
's
own
soliciting
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
begun
in
secret
to
despair
of
ever
winning
that
gentleman
's
favour
,
and
might
have
thought
that
he
was
now
and
then
disposed
to
put
a
slight
upon
him
,
which
was
hardly
just
.
<EOS>
But
what
would
have
been
duty
without
that
,
was
still
duty
with
it
---
or
Walter
thought
so
---
and
duty
must
be
done
.
  
<EOS>
When
Mr
Dombey
had
looked
at
him
,
and
told
him
he
was
young
,
and
that
his
uncle
's
circumstances
were
not
good
,
there
had
been
an
expression
of
disdain
in
his
face
;
a
contemptuous
and
disparaging
assumption
that
he
would
be
quite
content
to
live
idly
on
a
reduced
old
man
,
which
stung
the
boy
's
generous
soul
.
<EOS>
Determined
to
assure
Mr
Dombey
,
in
so
far
as
it
was
possible
to
give
him
the
assurance
without
expressing
it
in
words
,
that
indeed
he
mistook
his
nature
,
Walter
had
been
anxious
to
show
even
more
cheerfulness
and
activity
after
the
West
Indian
interview
than
he
had
shown
before
:
if
that
were
possible
,
in
one
of
his
quick
and
zealous
disposition
.
<EOS>
He
was
too
young
and
inexperienced
to
think
,
that
possibly
this
very
quality
in
him
was
not
agreeable
to
Mr
Dombey
,
and
that
it
was
no
stepping
-
stone
to
his
good
opinion
to
be
elastic
and
hopeful
of
pleasing
under
the
shadow
of
his
powerful
displeasure
,
whether
it
were
right
or
wrong
.
<EOS>
But
it
may
have
been
---
it
may
have
been
---
that
the
great
man
thought
himself
defied
in
this
new
exposition
of
an
honest
spirit
,
and
purposed
to
bring
it
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
at
last
and
at
least
,
Uncle
Sol
must
be
told
,
"
thought
Walter
,
with
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
And
as
Walter
was
apprehensive
that
his
voice
might
perhaps
quaver
a
little
,
and
that
his
countenance
might
not
be
quite
as
hopeful
as
he
could
wish
it
to
be
,
if
he
told
the
old
man
himself
,
and
saw
the
first
effects
of
his
communication
on
his
wrinkled
face
,
he
resolved
to
avail
himself
of
the
services
of
that
powerful
mediator
,
Captain
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
Sunday
coming
round
,
he
set
off
therefore
,
after
breakfast
,
once
more
to
beat
up
Captain
Cuttle
's
quarters
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
unpleasant
to
remember
,
on
the
way
thither
,
that
Mrs
MacStinger
resorted
to
a
great
distance
every
Sunday
morning
,
to
attend
the
ministry
of
the
Reverend
Melchisedech
Howler
,
who
,
having
been
one
day
discharged
from
the
West
India
Docks
on
a
false
suspicion
<EOS>
(
got
up
expressly
against
him
by
the
general
enemy
)
of
screwing
gimlets
into
puncheons
,
and
applying
his
lips
to
the
orifice
,
had
announced
the
destruction
of
the
world
for
that
day
two
years
,
at
ten
in
the
morning
,
and
opened
a
front
parlour
for
the
reception
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
Ranting
persuasion
,
upon
whom
,
on
the
first
occasion
of
their
assemblage
,
the
admonitions
of
the
Reverend
Melchisedech
had
produced
so
powerful
an
effect
,
that
,
in
their
rapturous
performance
of
a
sacred
jig
,
which
closed
the
service
,
the
whole
flock
broke
through
into
a
kitchen
below
,
and
disabled
a
mangle
belonging
to
one
of
the
fold
.
  
<EOS>
This
the
Captain
,
in
a
moment
of
uncommon
conviviality
,
had
confided
to
Walter
and
his
uncle
,
between
the
repetitions
of
lovely
Peg
,
on
the
night
when
Brogley
the
broker
was
paid
out
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
himself
was
punctual
in
his
attendance
at
a
church
in
his
own
neighbourhood
,
which
hoisted
the
Union
Jack
every
Sunday
morning
;
and
where
he
was
good
enough
---
the
lawful
beadle
being
infirm
---
to
keep
an
eye
upon
the
boys
,
over
whom
he
exercised
great
power
,
in
virtue
of
his
mysterious
hook
.
<EOS>
Knowing
the
regularity
of
the
Captain
's
habits
,
Walter
made
all
the
haste
he
could
,
that
he
might
anticipate
his
going
out
;
and
he
made
such
good
speed
,
that
he
had
the
pleasure
,
on
turning
into
Brig
Place
,
to
behold
the
broad
blue
coat
and
waistcoat
hanging
out
of
the
Captain
's
open
window
,
to
air
in
the
sun
.
  
<EOS>
It
appeared
incredible
that
the
coat
and
waistcoat
could
be
seen
by
mortal
eyes
without
the
Captain
:
but
he
certainly
was
not
in
them
,
<EOS>
otherwise
his
legs
---
the
houses
in
Brig
Place
not
being
lofty
---
would
have
obstructed
the
street
door
,
which
was
perfectly
clear
.
<EOS>
Quite
wondering
at
this
discovery
,
Walter
gave
a
single
knock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stinger
,
"
he
distinctly
heard
the
Captain
say
,
up
in
his
room
,
as
if
that
were
no
business
of
his
.
<EOS>
Therefore
Walter
gave
two
knocks
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cuttle
,
"
he
heard
the
Captain
say
upon
that
;
and
immediately
afterwards
the
Captain
,
in
his
clean
shirt
and
braces
,
with
his
neckerchief
hanging
loosely
round
his
throat
like
a
coil
of
rope
,
and
his
glazed
hat
on
,
appeared
at
the
window
,
leaning
out
over
the
broad
blue
coat
and
waistcoat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wal'r
!
"
cried
the
Captain
,
looking
down
upon
him
in
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
returned
Walter
,
"
only
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
,
my
lad
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
Captain
,
with
great
concern
.
<EOS>
"
Gills
an't
been
and
sprung
nothing
again
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
uncle
's
all
right
,
Captain
Cuttle
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
expressed
his
gratification
,
and
said
he
would
come
down
below
and
open
the
door
,
which
he
did
.
  
<EOS>
"
Though
you
're
early
,
Wal'r
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
eyeing
him
still
doubtfully
,
when
they
got
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
fact
is
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
said
Walter
,
sitting
down
,
<EOS>
"
I
was
afraid
you
would
have
gone
out
,
and
I
want
to
benefit
by
your
friendly
counsel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
shall
,
"
said
the
Captain
;
"
what
'll
you
take
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
take
your
opinion
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
returned
Walter
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
's
the
only
thing
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
on
then
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
With
a
will
,
my
lad
!
"
  
<EOS>
Walter
related
to
him
what
had
happened
;
and
the
difficulty
in
which
he
felt
respecting
his
uncle
,
and
the
relief
it
would
be
to
him
if
Captain
Cuttle
,
in
his
kindness
,
would
help
him
to
smooth
it
away
;
Captain
Cuttle
's
infinite
consternation
and
astonishment
at
the
prospect
unfolded
to
him
,
gradually
swallowing
that
gentleman
up
,
until
it
left
his
face
quite
vacant
,
and
the
suit
of
blue
,
the
glazed
hat
,
and
the
hook
,
apparently
without
an
owner
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
pursued
Walter
,
"
for
myself
<EOS>
,
I
am
young
,
as
Mr
Dombey
said
,
and
not
to
be
considered
.
<EOS>
I
am
to
fight
my
way
through
the
world
,
I
know
;
but
there
are
two
points
I
was
thinking
,
as
I
came
along
,
that
I
should
by
very
particular
about
,
in
respect
to
my
uncle
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
I
deserve
to
be
the
pride
and
delight
of
his
life
<EOS>
---
you
believe
me
,
I
know
---
but
I
am
.
<EOS>
Now
,
do
n't
you
think
I
am
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
seemed
to
make
an
endeavour
to
rise
from
the
depths
of
his
astonishment
,
and
get
back
to
his
face
;
but
the
effort
being
ineffectual
,
the
glazed
hat
merely
nodded
with
a
mute
,
unutterable
meaning
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
live
and
have
my
health
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
and
I
am
not
afraid
of
that
,
still
,
when
I
leave
England
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
hope
to
see
my
uncle
again
.
<EOS>
He
is
old
,
Captain
Cuttle
;
and
besides
,
his
life
is
a
life
of
custom
"
  
"
Steady
,
Wal'r
!
<EOS>
Of
a
want
of
custom
?
"
said
the
Captain
,
suddenly
reappearing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Too
true
,
"
returned
Walter
,
shaking
his
head
:
"
but
I
meant
a
life
of
habit
,
Captain
Cuttle
---
that
sort
of
custom
.
<EOS>
And
if
(
as
you
very
truly
said
,
I
am
sure
)
<EOS>
he
would
have
died
the
sooner
for
the
loss
of
the
stock
,
and
all
those
objects
to
which
he
has
been
accustomed
for
so
many
years
,
do
n't
you
think
he
might
die
a
little
sooner
for
the
loss
of
"
  
"
Of
his
Nevy
,
"
interposed
the
Captain
.
"
<EOS>
Right
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
"
said
Walter
,
trying
to
speak
gaily
,
"
we
must
do
our
best
to
make
him
believe
that
the
separation
is
but
a
temporary
one
,
after
all
;
but
as
I
know
better
,
or
dread
that
I
know
better
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
and
as
I
have
so
many
reasons
for
regarding
him
with
affection
,
and
duty
,
and
honour
,
I
am
afraid
I
should
make
but
<EOS>
a
very
poor
hand
at
that
,
if
I
tried
to
persuade
him
of
it
.
<EOS>
That
's
my
great
reason
for
wishing
you
to
break
it
out
to
him
;
and
that
's
the
first
point
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
her
off
a
point
or
so
!
"
<EOS>
observed
the
Captain
,
in
a
contemplative
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
say
,
Captain
Cuttle
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stand
by
!
"
returned
the
Captain
,
thoughtfully
.
  
<EOS>
Walter
paused
to
ascertain
if
the
Captain
had
any
particular
information
to
add
to
this
,
but
as
he
said
no
more
,
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
the
second
point
,
Captain
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
I
am
not
a
favourite
with
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
tried
to
do
my
best
,
and
I
have
always
done
it
;
but
he
does
not
like
me
.
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
help
his
likings
and
dislikings
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
only
say
that
I
am
certain
he
does
not
like
me
.
<EOS>
He
does
not
send
me
to
this
post
as
a
good
one
;
he
disdains
to
represent
it
as
being
better
than
it
is
;
and
I
doubt
very
much
if
it
will
ever
lead
me
to
advancement
in
the
House
---
whether
it
does
not
,
on
the
contrary
,
dispose
of
me
for
ever
,
and
put
me
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
Now
,
we
must
say
nothing
of
this
to
my
uncle
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
but
must
make
it
out
to
be
as
favourable
and
promising
as
we
can
;
and
when
I
tell
you
what
it
really
is
<EOS>
,
I
only
do
so
,
that
in
case
any
means
should
ever
arise
of
lending
me
a
hand
,
so
far
off
,
I
may
have
one
friend
at
home
who
knows
my
real
situation
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Wal'r
,
my
boy
,
"
replied
the
Captain
,
"
in
the
Proverbs
of
Solomon
you
will
find
the
following
words
,
"
May
we
never
want
a
friend
in
need
,
nor
a
bottle
to
give
him
!
"
<EOS>
When
found
,
make
a
note
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
the
Captain
stretched
out
his
hand
to
Walter
,
with
an
air
of
downright
good
faith
that
spoke
volumes
;
at
the
same
time
repeating
(
for
he
felt
proud
of
the
accuracy
and
pointed
application
of
his
quotation
)
,
"
When
found
,
make
a
note
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
said
Walter
,
taking
the
immense
fist
extended
to
him
by
the
Captain
in
both
his
hands
,
which
it
completely
filled
,
"
next
to
my
Uncle
Sol
<EOS>
,
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
one
on
earth
in
whom
I
can
more
safely
trust
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
mere
going
away
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
I
do
n't
care
for
that
;
why
should
I
care
for
that
!
<EOS>
If
I
were
free
to
seek
my
own
fortune
---
if
I
were
free
to
go
as
a
common
sailor
---
if
I
were
free
to
venture
on
my
own
account
to
the
farthest
end
of
the
world
---
I
would
gladly
go
!
<EOS>
I
would
have
gladly
gone
,
years
ago
,
and
taken
my
chance
of
what
might
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
against
my
uncle
's
wishes
,
and
against
the
plans
he
had
formed
for
me
;
and
there
was
an
end
of
that
.
<EOS>
But
what
I
feel
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
is
that
we
have
been
a
little
mistaken
all
along
,
and
that
,
so
far
as
any
improvement
in
my
prospects
is
concerned
,
I
am
no
better
off
now
than
I
was
when
I
first
entered
Dombey
's
House
-
perhaps
a
little
worse
,
for
the
House
may
have
been
kindly
inclined
towards
me
them
,
and
it
certainly
is
not
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Turn
again
,
Whittington
,
"
muttered
the
disconsolate
Captain
after
looking
at
Walter
for
some
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
"
replied
Walter
laughing
,
"
and
turn
a
great
many
times
,
too
Captain
Cuttle
<EOS>
,
I
'm
afraid
,
before
such
fortune
as
his
ever
turns
up
again
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
complain
,
"
he
added
,
in
his
lively
,
animated
,
energetic
way
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
complain
of
.
<EOS>
I
am
provided
for
.
<EOS>
I
can
live
.
<EOS>
When
I
leave
my
uncle
,
I
leave
him
to
you
;
and
I
can
leave
him
to
no
one
better
,
Captain
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
told
you
all
this
because
I
despair
,
not
I
;
it
's
to
convince
you
that
I
ca
n't
pick
and
choose
in
Dombey
's
House
,
and
that
where
I
am
sent
,
there
I
must
go
,
and
what
I
am
offered
,
that
I
must
take
.
<EOS>
It
's
better
for
my
uncle
that
I
should
be
sent
away
;
for
Mr
Dombey
is
a
valuable
friend
to
him
,
as
he
proved
himself
,
you
know
when
,
Captain
Cuttle
;
and
I
am
persuaded
he
wo
n't
be
less
valuable
when
he
has
n't
me
there
,
every
day
,
to
awaken
his
dislike
.
<EOS>
So
hurrah
for
the
West
Indies
,
Captain
Cuttle
!
<EOS>
How
does
that
tune
go
that
the
sailors
sing
?
  
<EOS>
"
For
the
Port
of
Barbados
,
Boys!Cheerily
!
  
<EOS>
Leaving
old
England
behind
us
,
Boys!Cheerily
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
the
Captain
roared
in
chorus
---
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
cheerily
,
cheerily!Oh
cheer
---
<EOS>
i
---
ly

"
  
<EOS>
The
last
line
reaching
the
quick
ears
of
an
ardent
skipper
not
quite
sober
,
who
lodged
opposite
,
and
who
instantly
sprung
out
of
bed
,
threw
up
his
window
,
and
joined
in
,
across
the
street
,
at
the
top
of
his
voice
,
produced
a
fine
effect
.
<EOS>
When
it
was
impossible
to
sustain
the
concluding
note
any
longer
,
the
skipper
bellowed
forth
a
terrific
"
ahoy
!
"
<EOS>
intended
in
part
as
a
friendly
greeting
,
and
in
part
to
show
that
he
was
not
at
all
breathed
.
<EOS>
That
done
,
he
shut
down
his
window
,
and
went
to
bed
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
said
Walter
,
handing
him
the
blue
coat
and
waistcoat
,
and
bustling
very
much
,
"
if
you
'll
come
and
break
the
news
to
Uncle
Sol
(
which
he
ought
to
have
known
,
days
upon
days
ago
,
by
rights
)
,
I
'll
leave
you
at
the
door
,
you
know
,
and
walk
about
until
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
however
,
scarcely
appeared
to
relish
the
commission
,
or
to
be
by
any
means
confident
of
his
powers
of
executing
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
arranged
the
future
life
and
adventures
of
Walter
so
very
differently
,
and
so
entirely
to
his
own
satisfaction
;
he
had
felicitated
himself
so
often
on
the
sagacity
and
foresight
displayed
in
that
arrangement
,
and
had
found
it
so
complete
and
perfect
in
all
its
parts
;
that
to
suffer
it
to
go
to
pieces
all
at
once
,
and
even
to
assist
in
breaking
it
up
,
required
a
great
effort
of
his
resolution
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
too
,
found
it
difficult
to
unload
his
old
ideas
upon
the
subject
,
and
to
take
a
perfectly
new
cargo
on
board
,
with
that
rapidity
which
the
circumstances
required
,
or
without
jumbling
and
confounding
the
two
.
<EOS>
Consequently
,
instead
of
putting
on
his
coat
and
waistcoat
with
anything
like
the
impetuosity
that
could
alone
have
kept
pace
with
Walter
's
mood
,
he
declined
to
invest
himself
with
those
garments
at
all
at
present
;
and
informed
Walter
that
on
such
a
serious
matter
,
he
must
be
allowed
to
"
bite
his
nails
a
bit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
an
old
habit
of
mine
,
Wal'r
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
any
time
these
fifty
year
.
<EOS>
When
you
see
Ned

his

Wal'r
,
then
you
may
know
that
Ned
Cuttle

aground
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thereupon
the
Captain
put
his
iron
hook
between
his
teeth
,
as
if
it
were
a
hand
;
and
with
an
air
of
wisdom
and
profundity
that
was
the
very
concentration
and
sublimation
of
all
philosophical
reflection
and
grave
inquiry
,
applied
himself
to
the
consideration
of
the
subject
in
its
various
branches
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
friend
of
mine
,
"
murmured
the
Captain
,
in
an
absent
manner
,
"
but
he
's
at
present
coasting
round
to
Whitby
<EOS>
,
that
would
deliver
such
an
opinion
on
this
subject
,
or
any
other
that
could
be
named
,
as
would
give
Parliament
six
and
beat
'em
.
<EOS>
Been
knocked
overboard
,
that
man
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
twice
,
and
none
the
worse
for
it
.
<EOS>
Was
beat
in
his
apprenticeship
,
for
three
weeks
(
off
and
on
)
,
about
the
head
with
a
ringbolt
.
<EOS>
And
yet
a
clearer
-
minded
man
do
n't
walk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
respect
for
Captain
Cuttle
,
Walter
could
not
help
inwardly
rejoicing
at
the
absence
of
this
sage
,
and
devoutly
hoping
that
his
limpid
intellect
might
not
be
brought
to
bear
on
his
difficulties
until
they
were
quite
settled
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
was
to
take
and
show
that
man
the
buoy
at
the
Nore
,
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
in
the
same
tone
,
"
and
ask
him
his
opinion
of
it
,
Wal'r
,
he
'd
give
you
an
opinion
that
was
no
more
like
that
buoy
than
your
uncle
's
buttons
are
.
<EOS>
There
ai
n't
a
man
that
walks
---
certainly
not
on
two
legs
---
that
can
come
near
him
.
<EOS>
Not
near
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
his
name
,
Captain
Cuttle
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Walter
,
determined
to
be
interested
in
the
Captain
's
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
name
's
Bunsby
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
Lord
,
it
might
be
anything
for
the
matter
of
that
,
with
such
a
mind
as
his
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
exact
idea
which
the
Captain
attached
to
this
concluding
piece
of
praise
,
he
did
not
further
elucidate
;
neither
did
Walter
seek
to
draw
it
forth
.
<EOS>
For
on
his
beginning
to
review
,
with
the
vivacity
natural
to
himself
and
to
his
situation
,
the
leading
points
in
his
own
affairs
,
he
soon
discovered
that
the
Captain
had
relapsed
into
his
former
profound
state
of
mind
;
and
that
while
he
eyed
him
steadfastly
from
beneath
his
bushy
eyebrows
,
he
evidently
neither
saw
not
heard
him
,
but
remained
immersed
in
cogitation
.
  
<EOS>
In
fact
,
Captain
Cuttle
was
labouring
with
such
great
designs
,
that
far
from
being
aground
,
he
soon
got
off
into
the
deepest
of
water
,
and
could
find
no
bottom
to
his
penetration
.
<EOS>
By
degrees
it
became
perfectly
plain
to
the
Captain
that
there
was
some
mistake
here
;
that
it
was
undoubtedly
much
more
likely
to
be
Walter
's
mistake
than
his
;
that
if
there
were
really
any
West
India
scheme
afoot
,
it
was
a
very
different
one
from
what
Walter
,
who
was
young
and
rash
,
supposed
;
and
could
only
be
some
new
device
for
making
his
fortune
with
unusual
celerity
.
<EOS>
"
Or
if
there
should
be
any
little
hitch
between
'
em
,
"
thought
the
Captain
,
meaning
between
Walter
and
Mr
Dombey
,
"
it
only
wants
a
word
in
season
from
a
friend
of
both
parties
,
to
set
it
right
and
smooth
,
and
make
all
taut
again
.
"
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
's
deduction
from
these
considerations
was
,
that
as
he
already
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
knowing
Mr
Dombey
,
from
having
spent
a
very
agreeable
half
-
hour
in
his
company
at
Brighton
(
on
the
morning
when
they
borrowed
the
money
)
;
and
that
,
as
a
couple
of
men
of
the
world
,
who
understood
each
other
,
and
were
mutually
disposed
to
make
things
comfortable
,
could
easily
arrange
any
little
difficulty
of
this
sort
,
and
come
at
the
real
facts
;
the
friendly
thing
for
him
to
do
would
be
,
without
saving
anything
about
it
to
Walter
at
present
,
just
to
step
up
to
Mr
Dombey
's
house
---
say
to
the
servant
"
Would
ye
be
so
good
,
<EOS>
my
lad
,
as
report
Cap'en
Cuttle
here
?
<EOS>
"
---
meet
Mr
Dombey
in
a
confidential
spirit
---
hook
him
by
the
button
-
hole
---
talk
it
over
---
make
it
all
right
---
and
come
away
triumphant
!
  
<EOS>
As
these
reflections
presented
themselves
to
the
Captain
's
mind
,
and
by
slow
degrees
assumed
this
shape
and
form
,
his
visage
cleared
like
a
doubtful
morning
when
it
gives
place
to
a
bright
noon
.
<EOS>
His
eyebrows
,
which
had
been
in
the
highest
degree
portentous
,
smoothed
their
rugged
bristling
aspect
,
and
became
serene
;
his
eyes
,
which
had
been
nearly
closed
in
the
severity
of
his
mental
exercise
,
opened
freely
;
a
smile
which
had
been
at
first
but
three
specks
---
one
at
the
right
-
hand
corner
of
his
mouth
,
and
one
at
the
corner
of
each
eye
---
gradually
overspread
his
whole
face
,
and
rippling
up
into
his
forehead
,
lifted
the
glazed
hat
:
as
if
that
too
had
been
aground
with
Captain
Cuttle
,
and
were
now
,
like
him
,
happily
afloat
again
.
  
<EOS>
Finally
the
Captain
left
off
biting
his
nails
,
and
said
,
"
Now
,
Wal'r
,
my
boy
,
you
may
help
me
on
with
them
slops
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
which
the
Captain
meant
his
coat
and
waistcoat
.
  
<EOS>
Walter
little
imagined
why
the
Captain
was
so
particular
in
the
arrangement
of
his
cravat
,
as
to
twist
the
pendent
ends
into
a
sort
of
pigtail
,
and
pass
them
through
a
massive
gold
ring
with
a
picture
of
a
tomb
upon
it
,
and
a
neat
iron
railing
,
and
a
tree
,
in
memory
of
some
deceased
friend
.
<EOS>
Nor
why
the
Captain
pulled
up
his
shirt
-
collar
to
the
utmost
limits
allowed
by
the
Irish
linen
below
,
and
by
so
doing
decorated
himself
with
a
complete
pair
of
blinkers
;
nor
why
he
changed
his
shoes
,
and
put
on
an
unparalleled
pair
of
ankle
-
jacks
,
which
he
only
wore
on
extraordinary
occasions
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
being
at
length
attired
to
his
own
complete
satisfaction
,
and
having
glanced
at
himself
from
head
to
foot
in
a
shaving
-
glass
which
he
removed
from
a
nail
for
that
purpose
,
took
up
his
knotted
stick
,
and
said
he
was
ready
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
's
walk
was
more
complacent
than
usual
when
they
got
out
into
the
street
;
but
this
Walter
supposed
to
be
the
effect
of
the
ankle
-
jacks
,
and
took
little
heed
of
.
<EOS>
Before
they
had
gone
very
far
,
they
encountered
a
woman
selling
flowers
;
when
the
Captain
stopping
short
,
as
if
struck
by
a
happy
idea
,
made
a
purchase
of
a
largest
bundle
in
her
basket
:
a
most
glorious
nosegay
,
fan
-
shaped
,
some
two
feet
and
a
half
round
,
and
composed
of
all
the
jolliest
-
looking
flowers
that
blow
.
  
<EOS>
Armed
with
this
little
token
which
he
designed
for
Mr
Dombey
,
Captain
Cuttle
walked
on
with
Walter
until
they
reached
the
Instrument
-
maker
's
door
,
before
which
they
both
paused
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
going
in
?
"
said
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
returned
the
Captain
,
who
felt
that
Walter
must
be
got
rid
of
before
he
proceeded
any
further
,
and
that
he
had
better
time
his
projected
visit
somewhat
later
in
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
wo
n't
forget
anything
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returned
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
upon
my
walk
at
once
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
<EOS>
and
then
I
shall
be
out
of
the
way
,
Captain
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
a
good
long
'
un
,
my
lad
!
"
replied
the
Captain
,
calling
after
him
.
<EOS>
Walter
waved
his
hand
in
assent
,
and
went
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
His
way
was
nowhere
in
particular
;
but
he
thought
he
would
go
out
into
the
fields
,
where
he
could
reflect
upon
the
unknown
life
before
him
,
and
resting
under
some
tree
,
ponder
quietly
.
<EOS>
He
knew
no
better
fields
than
those
near
Hampstead
,
and
no
better
means
of
getting
at
them
than
by
passing
Mr
Dombey
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
as
stately
and
as
dark
as
ever
,
when
he
went
by
and
glanced
up
at
its
frowning
front
.
<EOS>
The
blinds
were
all
pulled
down
,
but
the
upper
windows
stood
wide
open
,
and
the
pleasant
air
stirring
those
curtains
and
waving
them
to
and
fro
,
was
the
only
sign
of
animation
in
the
whole
exterior
.
<EOS>
Walter
walked
softly
as
he
passed
,
and
was
glad
when
he
had
left
the
house
a
door
or
two
behind
.
  
<EOS>
He
looked
back
then
;
with
the
interest
he
had
always
felt
for
the
place
since
the
adventure
of
the
lost
child
,
years
ago
;
and
looked
especially
at
those
upper
windows
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
thus
engaged
,
a
chariot
drove
to
the
door
,
and
a
portly
gentleman
in
black
,
with
a
heavy
watch
-
chain
,
alighted
,
and
went
in
.
<EOS>
When
he
afterwards
remembered
this
gentleman
and
his
equipage
together
,
Walter
had
no
doubt
he
was
a
physician
;
and
then
he
wondered
who
was
ill
;
but
the
discovery
did
not
occur
to
him
until
he
had
walked
some
distance
,
thinking
listlessly
of
other
things
.
   
<EOS>
Though
still
,
of
what
the
house
had
suggested
to
him
;
for
Walter
pleased
himself
with
thinking
that
perhaps
the
time
might
come
,
when
the
beautiful
child
who
was
his
old
friend
and
had
always
been
so
grateful
to
him
<EOS>
and
so
glad
to
see
him
since
<EOS>
,
might
interest
her
brother
in
his
behalf
and
influence
his
fortunes
for
the
better
.
<EOS>
He
liked
to
imagine
this
---
more
,
at
that
moment
,
for
the
pleasure
of
imagining
her
continued
remembrance
of
him
,
than
for
any
worldly
profit
he
might
gain
:
but
another
and
more
sober
fancy
whispered
to
him
that
if
he
were
alive
then
,
he
would
be
beyond
the
sea
and
forgotten
;
she
married
,
rich
,
proud
,
happy
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
more
reason
why
she
should
remember
him
with
any
interest
in
such
an
altered
state
of
things
,
than
any
plaything
she
ever
had
.
<EOS>
No
,
not
so
much
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
Walter
so
idealised
the
pretty
child
whom
he
had
found
wandering
in
the
rough
streets
,
and
so
identified
her
with
her
innocent
gratitude
of
that
night
and
the
simplicity
and
truth
of
its
expression
,
that
he
blushed
for
himself
as
a
libeller
when
he
argued
that
she
could
ever
grow
proud
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
his
meditations
were
of
that
fantastic
order
that
it
seemed
hardly
less
libellous
in
him
to
imagine
her
grown
a
woman
:
to
think
of
her
as
anything
but
the
same
artless
,
gentle
,
winning
little
creature
,
that
she
had
been
in
the
days
of
good
Mrs
Brown
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
Walter
found
out
that
to
reason
with
himself
about
Florence
at
all
,
was
to
become
very
unreasonable
indeed
;
and
that
he
could
do
not
better
than
preserve
her
image
in
his
mind
as
something
precious
,
unattainable
,
unchangeable
,
and
indefinite
---
indefinite
in
all
its
power
of
giving
him
pleasure
,
and
restraining
him
like
an
angel
's
hand
from
anything
unworthy
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
stroll
in
the
fields
that
Walter
took
that
day
,
listening
to
the
birds
,
and
the
Sunday
bells
,
and
the
softened
murmur
of
the
town
---
breathing
sweet
scents
;
glancing
sometimes
at
the
dim
horizon
beyond
which
his
voyage
and
his
place
of
destination
lay
;
then
looking
round
on
the
green
English
grass
and
the
home
landscape
.
<EOS>
But
he
hardly
once
thought
,
even
of
going
away
,
distinctly
;
and
seemed
to
put
off
reflection
idly
,
from
hour
to
hour
,
and
from
minute
to
minute
,
while
he
yet
went
on
reflecting
all
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
Walter
had
left
the
fields
behind
him
,
and
was
plodding
homeward
in
the
same
abstracted
mood
,
when
he
heard
a
shout
from
a
man
,
and
then
a
woman
's
voice
calling
to
him
loudly
by
name
.
<EOS>
Turning
quickly
in
his
surprise
,
he
saw
that
a
hackney
-
coach
,
going
in
the
contrary
direction
,
had
stopped
at
no
great
distance
;
that
the
coachman
was
looking
back
from
his
box
and
making
signals
to
him
with
his
whip
;
and
that
a
young
woman
inside
was
leaning
out
of
the
window
,
and
beckoning
with
immense
energy
.
<EOS>
Running
up
to
this
coach
,
he
found
that
the
young
woman
was
Miss
Nipper
,
and
that
Miss
Nipper
was
in
such
a
flutter
as
to
be
almost
beside
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Staggs
's
Gardens
,
Mr
Walter
!
"
said
Miss
Nipper
:
"
if
you
please
,
oh
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
"
cried
Walter
;
"
what
is
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr
Walter
,
Staggs
's
Gardens
,
if
you
please
!
"
said
Susan
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
cried
the
coachman
,
appealing
to
Walter
,
with
a
sort
of
exulting
despair
;
"
that
's
the
way
the
young
lady
's
been
a
goin'
on
for
up'ards
of
a
mortal
hour
,
and
me
continivally
backing
out
of
no
thoroughfares
,
where
she
would
drive
up
.
<EOS>
I
've
had
a
many
fares
in
this
coach
,
first
and
last
,
but
never
such
a
fare
as
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
want
to
go
to
Staggs
's
Gardens
,
Susan
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
She
wants
to
go
there
!
<EOS>
WHERE
IS
IT
?
<EOS>
"
growled
the
coachman
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
where
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Susan
,
wildly
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Walter
,
I
was
there
once
myself
,
along
with
Miss
Floy
and
our
poor
darling
Master
Paul
,
on
the
very
day
when
you
found
Miss
Floy
in
the
City
,
for
we
lost
her
coming
home
,
Mrs
Richards
and
me
,
and
a
mad
bull
,
and
Mrs
Richards
's
eldest
,
and
though
I
went
there
afterwards
<EOS>
,
I
ca
n't
remember
where
it
is
,
I
think
it
's
sunk
into
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mr
Walter
,
do
n't
desert
me
,
Staggs
's
Gardens
,
if
you
please
!
<EOS>
Miss
Floy
's
darling
---
all
our
darlings

little

meek

meek
Master
Paul

<EOS>
Oh
Mr
Walter
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
God

"
cried
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
Is
he
very
ill
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
pretty
flower
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Susan
,
wringing
her
hands
,
"
has
took
the
fancy
that
he
'd
like
to
see
his
old
nurse
,
and
I
've
come
to
bring
her
to
his
bedside
,
Mrs
Staggs
,
of
Polly
Toodle
's
Gardens
,
some
one
pray
!
"
  
<EOS>
Greatly
moved
by
what
he
heard
,
and
catching
Susan
's
earnestness
immediately
,
Walter
,
now
that
he
understood
the
nature
of
her
errand
,
dashed
into
it
with
such
ardour
that
the
coachman
had
enough
to
do
to
follow
closely
as
he
ran
before
,
inquiring
here
and
there
and
everywhere
,
the
way
to
Staggs
's
Gardens
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
such
place
as
Staggs
's
Gardens
.
<EOS>
It
had
vanished
from
the
earth
.
<EOS>
Where
the
old
rotten
summer
-
houses
once
had
stood
,
places
now
reared
their
heads
,
and
granite
columns
of
gigantic
girth
opened
a
vista
to
the
railway
world
beyond
.
<EOS>
The
miserable
waste
ground
,
where
the
refuse
-
matter
had
been
heaped
of
yore
,
was
swallowed
up
and
gone
;
and
in
its
frowsy
stead
were
tiers
of
warehouses
,
crammed
with
rich
goods
and
costly
merchandise
.
<EOS>
The
old
by
-
streets
now
swarmed
with
passengers
and
vehicles
of
every
kind
:
the
new
streets
that
had
stopped
disheartened
in
the
mud
and
waggon
-
ruts
,
formed
towns
within
themselves
,
originating
wholesome
comforts
and
conveniences
belonging
to
themselves
,
and
never
tried
nor
thought
of
until
they
sprung
into
existence
.
<EOS>
Bridges
that
had
led
to
nothing
,
led
to
villas
,
gardens
,
churches
,
healthy
public
walks
.
<EOS>
The
carcasses
of
houses
,
and
beginnings
of
new
thoroughfares
,
had
started
off
upon
the
line
at
steam
's
own
speed
,
and
shot
away
into
the
country
in
a
monster
train
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
neighbourhood
which
had
hesitated
to
acknowledge
the
railroad
in
its
straggling
days
,
that
had
grown
wise
and
penitent
,
as
any
Christian
might
in
such
a
case
,
and
now
boasted
of
its
powerful
and
prosperous
relation
.
<EOS>
There
were
railway
patterns
in
its
drapers
'
shops
,
and
railway
journals
in
the
windows
of
its
newsmen
.
<EOS>
There
were
railway
hotels
,
office

houses

lodging

;
railway

railway
streets
and
buildings
,
railway
hangers
-
on

parasites
,
and
flatterers
out
of
all
calculation
.
<EOS>
There
was
even
railway
time
observed
in
clocks
,
as
if
the
sun
itself
had
given
in
.
<EOS>
Among
the
vanquished
was
the
master
chimney
-
sweeper
,
whilome
incredulous
at
Staggs
's
Gardens
,
who
now
lived
in
a
stuccoed
house
three
stories
high
,
and
gave
himself
out
,
with
golden
flourishes
upon
a
varnished
board
,
as
contractor
for
the
cleansing
of
railway
chimneys
by
machinery
.
  
<EOS>
To
and
from
the
heart
of
this
great
change
,
all
day
and
night
,
throbbing
currents
rushed
and
returned
incessantly
like
its
life
's
blood
.
<EOS>
Crowds
of
people
and
mountains
of
goods
,
departing
and
arriving
scores
upon
scores
of
times
in
every
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
,
produced
a
fermentation
in
the
place
that
was
always
in
action
.
<EOS>
The
very
houses
seemed
disposed
to
pack
up
and
take
trips
.
<EOS>
Wonderful
Members
of
Parliament
,
who
,
little
more
than
twenty
years
before
,
had
made
themselves
merry
with
the
wild
railroad
theories
of
engineers
,
and
given
them
the
liveliest
rubs
in
cross
-
examination
,
went
down
into
the
north
with
their
watches
in
their
hands
,
and
sent
on
messages
before
by
the
electric
telegraph
,
to
say
that
they
were
coming
.
<EOS>
Night
and
day
<EOS>
the
conquering
engines
rumbled
at
their
distant
work
,
or
,
advancing
smoothly
to
their
journey
's
end
,
and
gliding
like
tame
dragons
into
the
allotted
corners
grooved
out
to
the
inch
for
their
reception
,
stood
bubbling
and
trembling
there
,
making
the
walls
quake
,
as
if
they
were
dilating
with
the
secret
knowledge
of
great
powers
yet
unsuspected
in
them
,
and
strong
purposes
not
yet
achieved
.
  
<EOS>
But
Staggs
's
Gardens
had
been
cut
up
root
and
branch
.
<EOS>
Oh
woe
the
day
when
"
not
a
rood
of
English
ground
"
---
laid
out
in
Staggs
's
Gardens
---
is
secure
!
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
after
much
fruitless
inquiry
,
Walter
,
followed
by
the
coach
and
Susan
,
found
a
man
who
had
once
resided
in
that
vanished
land
,
and
who
was
no
other
than
the
master
sweep
before
referred
to
,
grown
stout
,
and
knocking
a
double
knock
at
his
own
door
.
<EOS>
He
knowed
Toodle
,
he
said
,
well
.
<EOS>
Belonged
to
the
Railroad
,
did
n't
he
?
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
yes
!
"
cried
Susan
Nipper
from
the
coach
window
.
  
<EOS>
Where
did
he
live
now
?
<EOS>
hastily
inquired
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
He
lived
in
the
Company
's
own
Buildings
,
second
turning
to
the
right
,
down
the
yard
,
cross
over
,
and
take
the
second
on
the
right
again
.
<EOS>
It
was
number
eleven
;
they
could
n't
mistake
it
;
but
if
they
did
,
they
had
only
to
ask
for
Toodle
,
Engine
Fireman
,
and
any
one
would
show
them
which
was
his
house
.
<EOS>
At
this
unexpected
stroke
of
success
,
Susan
Nipper
dismounted
from
the
coach
with
all
speed
,
took
Walter
's
arm
,
and
set
off
at
a
breathless
pace
on
foot
;
leaving
the
coach
there
to
await
their
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
the
little
boy
been
long
ill
,
Susan
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Walter
,
as
they
hurried
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ailing
for
a
deal
of
time
,
but
no
one
knew
how
much
,
"
said
Susan
;
adding
,
with
excessive
sharpness
,
"
Oh
,
them
Blimbers
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Blimbers
?
"
echoed
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
forgive
myself
at
such
a
time
as
this
,
Mr
Walter
,
"
said
Susan
,
"
and
when
there
's
so
much
serious
distress
to
think
about
,
if
I
rested
hard
on
any
one
,
especially
on
them
that
little
darling
<EOS>
Paul
speaks
well
of
,
but
I
may
wish
that
the
family
was
set
to
work
in
a
stony
soil
to
make
new
roads
,
and
that
Miss
Blimber
went
in
front
,
and
had
the
pickaxe
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Nipper
then
took
breath
,
and
went
on
faster
than
before
,
as
if
this
extraordinary
aspiration
had
relieved
her
.
<EOS>
Walter
,
who
had
by
this
time
no
breath
of
his
own
to
spare
,
hurried
along
without
asking
any
more
questions
;
and
they
soon
,
in
their
impatience
,
burst
in
at
a
little
door
and
came
into
a
clean
parlour
full
of
children
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
's
Mrs
Richards
?
"
exclaimed
Susan
Nipper
,
looking
round
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
Mrs
Richards
,
Mrs
Richards
,
come
along
with
me
,
my
dear
creetur
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
if
it
an't
Susan
!
"
cried
Polly
,
rising
with
her
honest
face
and
motherly
figure
from
among
the
group
,
in
great
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mrs
Richards
,
it
's
me
,
"
said
Susan
,
"
and
I
wish
it
was
n't
,
though
I
may
not
seem
to
flatter
when
I
say
so
,
but
little
Master
Paul
is
very
ill
,
and
told
his
Pa
to
-
day
that
he
would
like
to
see
the
face
of
his
old
nurse
,
and
him
and
Miss
Floy
hope
you
'll
come
along
with
me
---
and
Mr
Walter
,
Mrs
Richards
---
<EOS>
forgetting
what
is
past
,
and
do
a
kindness
to
the
sweet
dear
that
is
withering
away
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mrs
Richards
,
withering
away
!
"
<EOS>
Susan
Nipper
crying
,
Polly
shed
tears
to
see
her
,
and
to
hear
what
she
had
said
;
and
all
the
children
gathered
round
(
including
numbers
of
new
babies
)
;
and
Mr
Toodle
,
who
had
just
come
home
from
Birmingham
,
and
was
eating
his
dinner
out
of
a
basin
,
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
put
on
his
wife
's
bonnet
and
shawl
for
her
,
which
were
hanging
up
behind
the
door
;
then
tapped
her
on
the
back
;
and
said
,
with
more
fatherly
feeling
than
eloquence
,
"
Polly!cut
away
!
"
  
<EOS>
So
they
got
back
to
the
coach
,
long
before
the
coachman
expected
them
;
and
Walter
,
putting
Susan
and
Mrs
Richards
inside
,
took
his
seat
on
the
box
himself
that
there
might
be
no
more
mistakes
,
and
deposited
them
safely
in
the
hall
of
Mr
Dombey
's
house
---
where
,
by
the
bye
,
he
saw
a
mighty
nosegay
lying
,
which
reminded
him
of
the
one
Captain
Cuttle
had
purchased
in
his
company
that
morning
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
lingered
to
know
more
of
the
young
invalid
,
or
waited
any
length
of
time
to
see
if
he
could
render
the
least
service
;
but
,
painfully
sensible
that
such
conduct
would
be
looked
upon
by
Mr
Dombey
as
presumptuous
and
forward
,
he
returned
slowly
,
sadly
,
anxiously
,
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
gone
five
minutes
'
walk
from
the
door
,
when
a
man
came
running
after
him
,
and
begged
him
to
return
.
<EOS>
Walter
retraced
his
steps
as
quickly
as
he
could
,
and
entered
the
gloomy
house
with
a
sorrowful
foreboding
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
16
.
<EOS>
What
the
Waves
were
always
saying
 
PAUL
had
never
risen
from
his
little
bed
.
<EOS>
He
lay
there
,
listening
to
the
noises
in
the
street
,
quite
tranquilly
;
not
caring
much
how
the
time
went
,
but
watching
it
and
watching
everything
about
him
with
observing
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
sunbeams
struck
into
his
room
through
the
rustling
blinds
,
and
quivered
on
the
opposite
wall
like
golden
water
,
he
knew
that
evening
was
coming
on
,
and
that
the
sky
was
red
and
beautiful
.
<EOS>
As
the
reflection
died
away
,
and
a
gloom
went
creeping
up
the
wall
,
he
watched
it
deepen
,
deepen
,
deepen
,
into
night
.
<EOS>
Then
he
thought
how
the
long
streets
were
dotted
with
lamps
,
and
how
the
peaceful
stars
were
shining
overhead
.
<EOS>
His
fancy
had
a
strange
tendency
to
wander
to
the
river
,
which
he
knew
was
flowing
through
the
great
city
;
and
now
he
thought
how
black
it
was
,
and
how
deep
it
would
look
,
reflecting
the
hosts
of
stars
---
and
more
than
all
,
how
steadily
it
rolled
away
to
meet
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
As
it
grew
later
in
the
night
,
and
footsteps
in
the
street
became
so
rare
that
he
could
hear
them
coming
,
count
them
as
they
passed
,
and
lose
them
in
the
hollow
distance
,
he
would
lie
and
watch
the
many
-
coloured
ring
about
the
candle
,
and
wait
patiently
for
day
.
<EOS>
His
only
trouble
was
,
the
swift
and
rapid
river
.
<EOS>
He
felt
forced
,
sometimes
,
to
try
to
stop
it
---
to
stem
it
with
his
childish
hands
---
or
choke
its
way
with
sand
---
and
when
he
saw
it
coming
on
,
resistless
,
he
cried
out
!
<EOS>
But
a
word
from
Florence
,
who
was
always
at
his
side
,
restored
him
to
himself
;
and
leaning
his
poor
head
upon
her
breast
,
he
told
Floy
of
his
dream
,
and
smiled
.
  
<EOS>
When
day
began
to
dawn
again
,
he
watched
for
the
sun
;
and
when
its
cheerful
light
began
to
sparkle
in
the
room
,
he
pictured
to
himself
---
pictured
!
<EOS>
he
saw
---
the
high
church
towers
rising
up
into
the
morning
sky
,
the
town
reviving
,
waking
,
starting
into
life
once
more
,
the
river
glistening
as
it
rolled
(
but
rolling
fast
as
ever
)
,
and
the
country
bright
with
dew
.
<EOS>
Familiar
sounds
and
cries
came
by
degrees
into
the
street
below
;
the
servants
in
the
house
were
roused
and
busy
;
faces
looked
in
at
the
door
,
and
voices
asked
his
attendants
softly
how
he
was
.
<EOS>
Paul
always
answered
for
himself
,
"
I
am
better
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
great
deal
better
,
thank
you
!
<EOS>
Tell
Papa
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
By
little
and
little
,
he
got
tired
of
the
bustle
of
the
day
,
the
noise
of
carriages
and
carts
,
and
people
passing
and
repassing
;
and
would
fall
asleep
,
or
be
troubled
with
a
restless
and
uneasy
sense
again
---
the
child
could
hardly
tell
whether
this
were
in
his
sleeping
or
his
waking
moments
---
of
that
rushing
river
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
will
it
never
stop
,
Floy
?
"
he
would
sometimes
ask
her
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
bearing
me
away
,
I
think
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
Floy
could
always
soothe
and
reassure
him
;
and
it
was
his
daily
delight
to
make
her
lay
her
head
down
on
his
pillow
,
and
take
some
rest
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
always
watching
me
,
Floy
.
<EOS>
Let
me
watch
you
,
now
!
<EOS>
"
They
would
prop
him
up
with
cushions
in
a
corner
of
his
bed
,
and
there
he
would
recline
the
while
she
lay
beside
him
:
bending
forward
oftentimes
to
kiss
her
,
and
whispering
to
those
who
were
near
that
she
was
tired
,
and
how
she
had
sat
up
so
many
night
beside
him
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
,
the
flush
of
the
day
,
in
its
heat
and
light
,
would
gradually
decline
;
and
again
the
golden
water
would
be
dancing
on
the
wall
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
visited
by
as
many
as
three
grave
doctors
---
they
used
to
assemble
downstairs
,
and
come
up
together
---
and
the
room
was
so
quiet
,
and
Paul
was
so
observant
of
them
(
though
he
never
asked
of
anybody
what
they
said
)
,
that
he
even
knew
the
difference
in
the
sound
of
their
watches
.
<EOS>
But
his
interest
centred
in
Sir
Parker
Peps
,
who
always
took
his
seat
on
the
side
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
For
Paul
had
heard
them
say
long
ago
,
that
that
gentleman
had
been
with
his
mama
when
she
clasped
Florence
in
her
arms
,
and
died
.
<EOS>
And
he
could
not
forget
it
,
now
.
<EOS>
He
liked
him
for
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
afraid
.
  
<EOS>
The
people
round
him
changed
as
unaccountably
as
on
that
first
night
at
Doctor
Blimber
's
---
except
Florence
;
Florence
never
changed
---
and
what
had
been
Sir
Parker
Peps
,
was
now
his
father
,
sitting
with
his
head
upon
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Old
Mrs
Pipchin
dozing
in
an
easy
chair
,
often
changed
to
Miss
Tox
,
or
his
aunt
;
and
Paul
was
quite
content
to
shut
his
eyes
again
,
and
see
what
happened
next
without
emotion
.
<EOS>
But
this
figure
with
its
head
upon
its
hand
returned
so
often
,
and
remained
so
long
,
and
sat
so
still
and
solemn
,
never
speaking
,
never
being
spoken
to
,
and
rarely
lifting
up
its
face
,
that
Paul
began
to
wonder
languidly
,
if
it
were
real
;
and
in
the
night
-
time
saw
it
sitting
there
,
with
fear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Floy
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
,
dearest
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
<EOS>
at
the
bottom
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
there
,
except
Papa
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
figure
lifted
up
its
head
,
and
rose
,
and
coming
to
the
beside
,
said
:
"
My
own
boy
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Paul
looked
it
in
the
face
,
and
thought
,
was
this
his
father
?
<EOS>
But
the
face
so
altered
to
his
thinking
,
thrilled
while
he
gazed
,
as
if
it
were
in
pain
;
and
before
he
could
reach
out
both
his
hands
to
take
it
between
them
,
and
draw
it
towards
him
,
the
figure
turned
away
quickly
from
the
little
bed
,
and
went
out
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Paul
looked
at
Florence
with
a
fluttering
heart
,
but
he
knew
what
she
was
going
to
say
,
and
stopped
her
with
his
face
against
her
lips
.
<EOS>
The
next
time
he
observed
the
figure
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
the
bed
,
he
called
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
so
sorry
for
me
,
dear
Papa
!
<EOS>
Indeed
I
am
quite
happy
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
father
coming
and
bending
down
to
him
---
which
he
did
quickly
,
and
without
first
pausing
by
the
bedside
---
Paul
held
him
round
the
neck
,
and
repeated
those
words
to
him
several
times
,
and
very
earnestly
;
and
Paul
never
saw
him
in
his
room
again
at
any
time
,
whether
it
were
day
or
night
,
but
he
called
out
,
"
Do
n't
be
so
sorry
for
me
!
<EOS>
Indeed
I
am
quite
happy
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
was
the
beginning
of
his
always
saying
in
the
morning
that
he
was
a
great
deal
better
,
and
that
they
were
to
tell
his
father
so
.
  
<EOS>
How
many
times
the
golden
water
danced
upon
the
wall
;
how
many
nights
the
dark
,
dark
river
rolled
towards
the
sea
in
spite
of
him
;
Paul
never
counted
,
never
sought
to
know
.
<EOS>
If
their
kindness
,
or
his
sense
of
it
,
could
have
increased
,
they
were
more
kind
,
and
he
more
grateful
every
day
;
but
whether
they
were
many
days
or
few
,
appeared
of
little
moment
now
,
to
the
gentle
boy
.
   
<EOS>
One
night
he
had
been
thinking
of
his
mother
,
and
her
picture
in
the
drawing
-
room
down
stairs
,
and
thought
she
must
have
loved
sweet
Florence
better
than
his
father
did
,
to
have
held
her
in
her
arms
when
she
felt
that
she
was
dying
---
for
even
he
,
her
brother
,
who
had
such
dear
love
for
her
,
could
have
no
greater
wish
than
that
.
<EOS>
The
train
of
thought
suggested
to
him
to
inquire
if
he
had
ever
seen
his
mother
;
for
he
could
not
remember
whether
they
had
told
him
,
yes
or
no
,
the
river
running
very
fast
,
and
confusing
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Floy
,
did
I
ever
see
mama
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
darling
,
why
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Did
I
ever
see
any
kind
face
,
like
mama
's
,
looking
at
me
when
I
was
a
baby
,
Floy
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
asked
,
incredulously
,
as
if
he
had
some
vision
of
a
face
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
dear
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whose
,
Floy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
old
nurse
's
.
<EOS>
Often
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
is
my
old
nurse
?
"
said
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
Is
she
dead
too
?
<EOS>
Floy
,
are
we
all
dead
,
except
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
hurry
in
the
room
,
for
an
instant
---
longer
,
perhaps
;
but
it
seemed
no
more
---
then
all
was
still
again
;
and
Florence
,
with
her
face
quite
colourless
,
but
smiling
,
held
his
head
upon
her
arm
.
<EOS>
Her
arm
trembled
very
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
Show
me
that
old
nurse
,
Floy
,
if
you
please
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
here
,
darling
.
<EOS>
She
shall
come
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Floy
!
"
  
<EOS>
Paul
closed
his
eyes
with
those
words
,
and
fell
asleep
.
<EOS>
When
he
awoke
,
the
sun
was
high
,
and
the
broad
day
was
clear
and
warm
.
<EOS>
He
lay
a
little
,
looking
at
the
windows
,
which
were
open
,
and
the
curtains
rustling
in
the
air
,
and
waving
to
and
fro
:
then
he
said
,
"
Floy
,
is
it
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
Is
she
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Some
one
seemed
to
go
in
quest
of
her
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
Susan
.
<EOS>
Paul
thought
he
heard
her
telling
him
when
he
had
closed
his
eyes
again
,
that
she
would
soon
be
back
;
but
he
did
not
open
them
to
see
.
<EOS>
She
kept
her
word
---
perhaps
she
had
never
been
away
---
but
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
a
noise
of
footsteps
on
the
stairs
,
and
then
Paul
woke
---
woke
mind
and
body
---
and
sat
upright
in
his
bed
.
<EOS>
He
saw
them
now
about
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
grey
mist
before
them
,
as
there
had
been
sometimes
in
the
night
.
<EOS>
He
knew
them
every
one
,
and
called
them
by
their
names
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
is
this
?
<EOS>
Is
this
my
old
nurse
?
"
said
the
child
,
regarding
with
a
radiant
smile
,
a
figure
coming
in
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
.
<EOS>
No
other
stranger
would
have
shed
those
tears
at
sight
of
him
,
and
called
him
her
dear
boy
,
her
pretty
boy
,
her
own
poor
blighted
child
.
<EOS>
No
other
woman
would
have
stooped
down
by
his
bed
,
and
taken
up
his
wasted
hand
,
and
put
it
to
her
lips
and
breast
,
as
one
who
had
some
right
to
fondle
it
.
<EOS>
No
other
woman
would
have
so
forgotten
everybody
there
but
him
and
Floy
,
and
been
so
full
of
tenderness
and
pity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Floy
!
<EOS>
this
is
a
kind
good
face
!
"
said
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
see
again
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
go
away
,
old
nurse
!
<EOS>
Stay
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
senses
were
all
quickened
,
and
he
heard
a
name
he
knew
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
was
that
,
who
said
"
Walter
"
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
looking
round
.
<EOS>
"
Some
one
said
Walter
.
<EOS>
Is
he
here
?
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
him
very
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
Nobody
replied
directly
;
but
his
father
soon
said
to
Susan
,
"
Call
him
back
,
then
:
let
him
come
up
!
"
<EOS>
After
a
short
pause
of
expectation
,
during
which
he
looked
with
smiling
interest
and
wonder
,
on
his
nurse
,
and
saw
that
she
had
not
forgotten
Floy
,
Walter
was
brought
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
His
open
face
and
manner
,
and
his
cheerful
eyes
,
had
always
made
him
a
favourite
with
Paul
;
and
when
Paul
saw
him
,
he
stretched
out
his
hand
,
and
said
"
Good
-
bye
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
my
child
!
"
said
Mrs
Pipchin
,
hurrying
to
his
bed
's
head
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
good
-
bye
?
"
  
<EOS>
For
an
instant
,
Paul
looked
at
her
with
the
wistful
face
with
which
he
had
so
often
gazed
upon
her
in
his
corner
by
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
yes
,
"
he
said
placidly
,
"
<EOS>
good
-
bye
!
<EOS>
Walter
dear
,
good
-
bye
!
"
<EOS>
---
turning
his
head
to
where
he
stood
,
and
putting
out
his
hand
again
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Papa
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
felt
his
father
's
breath
upon
his
check
,
before
the
words
had
parted
from
his
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
Remember
Walter
,
dear
papa
,
"
he
whispered
,
looking
in
his
face
.
"
<EOS>
Remember
Walter
.
<EOS>
I
was
fond
of
Walter
!
"
<EOS>
The
feeble
hand
waved
in
the
air
,
as
if
it
cried
"
good
-
bye!'to
Walter
once
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
lay
me
down
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
,
Floy
,
come
close
to
me
,
and
let
me
see
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Sister
and
brother
wound
their
arms
around
each
other
,
and
the
golden
light
came
streaming
in
,
and
fell
upon
them
,
locked
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
fast
the
river
runs
,
between
its
green
banks
and
the
rushes
,
Floy
!
<EOS>
But
it
's
very
near
the
sea
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
waves!They
always
said
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
Presently
he
told
her
that
the
motion
of
the
boat
upon
the
stream
was
lulling
him
to
rest
.
<EOS>
How
green
the
banks
were
now
,
how
bright
the
flowers
growing
on
them
,
and
how
tall
the
rushes
!
<EOS>
Now
the
boat
was
out
at
sea
,
but
gliding
smoothly
on
.
<EOS>
And
now
there
was
a
shore
before
him
.
<EOS>
Who
stood
on
the
bank
!
---
   
<EOS>
He
put
his
hands
together
,
as
he
had
been
used
to
do
at
his
prayers
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
remove
his
arms
to
do
it
;
but
they
saw
him
fold
them
<EOS>
so
,
behind
her
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mama
is
like
you
,
Floy
.
<EOS>
I
know
her
by
the
face
!
<EOS>
But
tell
them
that
the
print
upon
the
stairs
at
school
is
not
divine
enough
.
<EOS>
The
light
about
the
head
is
shining
on
me
as
I
go
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
golden
ripple
on
the
wall
came
back
again
,
and
nothing
else
stirred
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
old
,
old
fashion
!
<EOS>
The
fashion
that
came
in
with
our
first
garments
,
and
will
last
unchanged
until
our
race
has
run
its
course
,
and
the
wide
firmament
is
rolled
up
like
a
scroll
.
<EOS>
The
old
,
old
fashion
---
Death
!
  
<EOS>
Oh
thank
God
,
all
who
see
it
,
for
that
older
fashion
yet
,
of
Immortality
!
<EOS>
And
look
upon
us
,
angels
of
young
children
,
with
regards
not
quite
estranged
,
when
the
swift
river
bears
us
to
the
ocean

Chapter

.
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
does
a
little
Business
for
the
Young
People
 
CAPTAIN
CUTTLE
,
in
the
exercise
of
that
surprising
talent
for
deep
-
laid
and
unfathomable
scheming
,
with
which
(
as
is
not
unusual
in
men
of
transparent
simplicity
)
<EOS>
he
sincerely
believed
himself
to
be
endowed
by
nature
,
had
gone
to
Mr
Dombey
's
house
on
the
eventful
Sunday
,
winking
all
the
way
as
a
vent
for
his
superfluous
sagacity
,
and
had
presented
himself
in
the
full
lustre
of
the
ankle
-
jacks
before
the
eyes
of
Towlinson
.
<EOS>
Hearing
from
that
individual
,
to
his
great
concern
,
of
the
impending
calamity
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
in
his
delicacy
,
sheered
off
again
confounded
;
merely
handing
in
the
nosegay
as
a
small
mark
of
his
solicitude
,
and
leaving
his
respectful
compliments
for
the
family
in
general
,
which
he
accompanied
with
an
expression
of
his
hope
that
they
would
lay
their
heads
well
to
the
wind
under
existing
circumstances
,
and
a
friendly
intimation
that
he
would
"
look
up
again
'
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
's
compliments
were
never
heard
of
any
more
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
's
nosegay
,
after
lying
in
the
hall
all
night
,
was
swept
into
the
dust
-
bin
next
morning
;
and
the
Captain
's
sly
arrangement
,
involved
in
one
catastrophe
with
greater
hopes
and
loftier
designs
,
was
crushed
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
So
when
an
avalanche
bears
down
a
mountain
-
forest
,
twigs
and
bushes
suffer
with
the
trees
,
and
all
perish
together
.
  
<EOS>
When
Walter
returned
home
on
the
Sunday
evening
from
his
long
walk
,
and
its
memorable
close
,
he
was
too
much
occupied
at
first
by
the
tidings
he
had
to
give
them
,
and
by
the
emotions
naturally
awakened
in
his
breast
by
the
scene
through
which
he
had
passed
,
to
observe
either
that
his
uncle
was
evidently
unacquainted
with
the
intelligence
the
Captain
had
undertaken
to
impart
,
or
that
the
Captain
made
signals
with
his
hook
,
warning
him
to
avoid
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Not
that
the
Captain
's
signals
were
calculated
to
have
proved
very
comprehensible
,
however
attentively
observed
;
for
,
like
those
Chinese
sages
who
are
said
in
their
conferences
to
write
certain
learned
words
in
the
air
that
are
wholly
impossible
of
pronunciation
,
the
Captain
made
such
waves
and
flourishes
as
nobody
without
a
previous
knowledge
of
his
mystery
,
would
have
been
at
all
likely
to
understand
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
however
,
becoming
cognisant
of
what
had
happened
,
relinquished
these
attempts
,
as
he
perceived
the
slender
chance
that
now
existed
of
his
being
able
to
obtain
a
little
easy
chat
with
Mr
Dombey
before
the
period
of
Walter
's
departure
.
<EOS>
But
in
admitting
to
himself
,
with
a
disappointed
and
crestfallen
countenance
,
that
Sol
Gills
must
be
told
,
and
that
Walter
must
go
---
taking
the
case
for
the
present
as
he
found
it
,
and
not
having
it
enlightened
or
improved
beforehand
by
the
knowing
management
of
a
friend
---
the
Captain
still
felt
an
unabated
confidence
that
he
,
Ned
Cuttle
,
was
the
man
for
Mr
Dombey
;
and
that
,
to
set
Walter
's
fortunes
quite
square
,
nothing
was
wanted
but
that
they
two
should
come
together
.
<EOS>
For
the
Captain
never
could
forget
how
well
he
and
Mr
Dombey
had
got
on
at
Brighton
;
with
what
nicety
each
of
them
had
put
in
a
word
when
it
was
wanted
;
how
exactly
they
had
taken
one
another
's
measure
;
nor
how
Ned
Cuttle
had
pointed
out
that
resource
in
the
first
extremity
,
and
had
brought
the
interview
to
the
desired
termination
.
<EOS>
On
all
these
grounds
the
Captain
soothed
himself
with
thinking
that
though
Ned
Cuttle
was
forced
by
the
pressure
of
events
to
"
stand
by
"
almost
useless
for
the
present
,
Ned
would
fetch
up
with
a
wet
sail
in
good
time
,
and
carry
all
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
Under
the
influence
of
this
good
-
natured
delusion
,
Captain
Cuttle
even
went
to
far
as
to
revolve
in
his
own
bosom
,
while
he
sat
looking
at
Walter
and
listening
with
a
tear
on
his
shirt
-
collar
to
what
he
related
,
whether
it
might
not
be
at
once
genteel
and
politic
to
give
Mr
Dombey
a
verbal
invitation
,
whenever
they
should
meet
,
to
come
and
cut
his
mutton
in
Brig
Place
on
some
day
of
his
own
naming
,
and
enter
on
the
question
of
his
young
friend
's
prospects
over
a
social
glass
.
<EOS>
But
the
uncertain
temper
of
Mrs
MacStinger
,
and
the
possibility
of
her
setting
up
her
rest
in
the
passage
during
such
an
entertainment
,
and
there
delivering
some
homily
of
an
uncomplimentary
nature
,
operated
as
a
check
on
the
Captain
's
hospitable
thoughts
,
and
rendered
him
timid
of
giving
them
encouragement
.
  
<EOS>
One
fact
was
quite
clear
to
the
Captain
,
as
Walter
,
sitting
thoughtfully
over
his
untasted
dinner
,
dwelt
on
all
that
had
happened
;
namely
,
that
however
Walter
's
modesty
might
stand
in
the
way
of
his
perceiving
it
himself
,
he
was
as
one
might
say
,
a
member
of
Mrs
Dombey
's
family
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
,
in
his
own
person
,
connected
with
the
incident
he
so
pathetically
described
;
he
had
been
by
name
remembered
and
commended
in
close
association
with
it
;
and
his
fortunes
must
have
a
particular
interest
in
his
employer
's
eyes
.
<EOS>
If
the
Captain
had
any
lurking
doubt
whatever
of
his
own
conclusions
,
he
had
not
the
least
doubt
that
they
were
good
conclusions
for
the
peace
of
mind
of
the
Instrument
-
maker
.
<EOS>
Therefore
he
availed
himself
of
so
favourable
a
movement
for
breaking
the
West
Indian
Intelligence
to
his
old
friend
,
as
a
piece
of
extraordinary
preferment
;
declaring
that
for
his
part
he
would
freely
give
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
(
if
he
had
it
)
for
Walter
's
gain
in
the
long
-
run
,
and
that
he
had
no
doubt
such
an
investment
would
yield
a
handsome
premium
.
  
<EOS>
Solomon
Gills
was
at
first
stunned
by
the
communication
,
which
fell
upon
the
little
back
-
parlour
like
a
thunderbolt
,
and
tore
up
the
hearth
savagely
.
<EOS>
But
the
Captain
flashed
such
golden
prospects
before
his
dim
sight
:
hinted
so
mysteriously
at
Whittingtonian
consequences
;
laid
such
emphasis
on
what
Walter
had
just
now
told
them
:
and
appealed
to
it
so
confidently
as
a
corroboration
of
his
predictions
,
and
a
great
advance
towards
the
realisation
of
the
romantic
legend
of
Lovely
Peg
:
that
he
bewildered
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
Walter
,
for
his
part
,
feigned
to
be
so
full
of
hope
and
ardour
,
and
so
sure
of
coming
home
again
soon
,
and
backed
up
the
Captain
with
such
expressive
shakings
of
his
head
and
rubbings
of
his
hands
,
that
Solomon
,
looking
first
at
him
and
then
at
Captain
Cuttle
,
began
to
think
he
ought
to
be
transported
with
joy
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
'm
behind
the
time
<EOS>
,
you
understand
,
"
he
observed
in
apology
,
passing
his
hand
nervously
down
the
whole
row
of
bright
buttons
on
his
coat
,
and
then
up
again
,
as
if
they
were
beads
and
he
were
telling
them
twice
over
:
"
and
I
would
rather
have
my
dear
boy
here
.
<EOS>
It
's
an
old
-
fashioned
notion
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
He
was
always
fond
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
He
's
"
---
and
he
looked
wistfully
at
Walter
<EOS>
---
"
he
's
glad
to
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Uncle
Sol
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Walter
,
quickly
,
"
if
you
say
that
,
I
wo
n't
go
.
<EOS>
No
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
I
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
If
my
uncle
thinks
I
could
be
glad
to
leave
him
,
though
I
was
going
to
be
made
Governor
of
all
the
Islands
in
the
West
Indies
<EOS>
,
that
's
enough
.
<EOS>
I
'm
a
fixture
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Wal'r
,
my
lad
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Steady
!
<EOS>
Sol
Gills
,
take
an
observation
of
your
nevy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Following
with
his
eyes
the
majestic
action
of
the
Captain
's
hook
,
the
old
man
looked
at
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
is
a
certain
craft
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
with
a
magnificent
sense
of
the
allegory
into
which
he
was
soaring
,
"
a
-
going
to
put
out
on
a
certain
voyage
.
<EOS>
What
name
is
wrote
upon
that
craft
indelibly
?
<EOS>
Is
it
The
Gay
?
<EOS>
or
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
raising
his
voice
as
much
as
to
say
,
observe
the
point
of
this
,
"
is
it
The
Gills
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ned
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
drawing
Walter
to
his
side
,
and
taking
his
arm
tenderly
through
his
,
"
I
know
.
<EOS>
I
know
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
know
that
Wally
considers
me
more
than
himself
always
.
<EOS>
That
's
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
When
I
say
he
is
glad
to
go
,
I
mean
I
hope
he
is
.
<EOS>
Eh
?
<EOS>
look
you
,
Ned
,
and
you
too
,
Wally
,
my
dear
,
this
is
new
and
unexpected
to
me
;
and
I
'm
afraid
my
being
behind
the
time
,
and
poor
,
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
<EOS>
Is
it
really
good
fortune
for
him
,
do
you
tell
me
,
now
?
"
said
the
old
man
,
looking
anxiously
from
one
to
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Really
and
truly
?
<EOS>
Is
it
?
<EOS>
I
can
reconcile
myself
to
almost
anything
that
advances
Wally
,
but
I
wo
n't
have
Wally
putting
himself
at
any
disadvantage
for
me
,
or
keeping
anything
from
me
.
<EOS>
You
,
Ned
Cuttle
!
"
said
the
old
man
,
fastening
on
the
Captain
,
to
the
manifest
confusion
of
that
diplomatist
;
"
are
you
dealing
plainly
by
your
old
friend
?
<EOS>
Speak
out
,
Ned
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
behind
?
<EOS>
Ought
he
to
go
?
<EOS>
How
do
you
know
it
first
,
and
why
?
<EOS>
"
  
As
it
was
a
contest
of
affection
and
self
-
denial
,
Walter
struck
in
with
infinite
effect
,
to
the
Captain
's
relief
;
and
between
them
they
tolerably
reconciled
old
Sol
Gills
,
by
continued
talking
,
to
the
project
;
or
rather
so
confused
him
,
that
nothing
,
not
even
the
pain
of
separation
,
was
distinctly
clear
to
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
much
time
to
balance
the
matter
;
for
on
the
very
next
day
,
Walter
received
from
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
,
the
necessary
credentials
for
his
passage
and
outfit
,
together
with
the
information
that
the
Son
and
Heir
would
said
in
a
fortnight
,
or
within
a
day
or
two
afterwards
at
latest
.
<EOS>
In
the
hurry
of
preparation
:
which
Walter
purposely
enhanced
as
much
as
possible
:
the
old
man
lost
what
little
self
-
possession
he
ever
had
;
and
so
the
time
of
departure
drew
on
rapidly
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
who
did
not
fail
to
make
himself
acquainted
with
all
that
passed
,
through
inquiries
of
Walter
from
day
to
day
,
found
the
time
still
tending
on
towards
his
going
away
,
without
any
occasion
offering
itself
,
or
seeming
likely
to
offer
itself
,
for
a
better
understanding
of
his
position
.
<EOS>
It
was
after
much
consideration
of
this
fact
,
and
much
pondering
over
such
an
unfortunate
combination
of
circumstances
,
that
a
bright
idea
occurred
to
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
Suppose
he
made
a
call
on
Mr
Carker
,
and
tried
to
find
out
from
him
how
the
land
really
lay
!
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
liked
this
idea
very
much
.
<EOS>
It
came
upon
him
in
a
moment
of
inspiration
,
as
he
was
smoking
an
early
pipe
in
Brig
Place
after
breakfast
;
and
it
was
worthy
of
the
tobacco
.
<EOS>
It
would
quiet
his
conscience
,
which
was
an
honest
one
,
and
was
made
a
little
uneasy
by
what
Walter
had
confided
to
him
,
and
what
Sol
Gills
had
said
;
and
it
would
be
a
deep
,
shrewd
act
of
friendship
.
<EOS>
He
would
sound
Mr
Carker
carefully
,
and
say
much
or
little
,
just
as
he
read
that
gentleman
's
character
,
and
discovered
that
they
got
on
well
together
or
the
reverse
.
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
without
the
fear
of
Walter
before
his
eyes
(
who
he
knew
was
at
home
packing
)
,
Captain
Cuttle
again
assumed
his
ankle
-
jacks
and
mourning
brooch
,
and
issued
forth
on
this
second
expedition
.
<EOS>
He
purchased
no
propitiatory
nosegay
on
the
present
occasion
,
as
he
was
going
to
a
place
of
business
;
but
he
put
a
small
sunflower
in
his
button
-
hole
to
give
himself
an
agreeable
relish
of
the
country
;
and
with
this
,
and
the
knobby
stick
,
and
the
glazed
hat
,
bore
down
upon
the
offices
of
Dombey
and
Son
.
  
<EOS>
After
taking
a
glass
of
warm
rum
-
and
-
water
at
a
tavern
close
by
,
to
collect
his
thoughts
,
the
Captain
made
a
rush
down
the
court
,
lest
its
good
effects
should
evaporate
,
and
appeared
suddenly
to
Mr
Perch
.
  
<EOS>
"
Matey
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
in
persuasive
accents
.
<EOS>
"
One
of
your
Governors
is
named
Carker
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Perch
admitted
it
;
but
gave
him
to
understand
,
as
in
official
duty
bound
,
that
all
his
Governors
were
engaged
,
and
never
expected
to
be
disengaged
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look'ee
here
,
mate
,
"
said
the
Captain
in
his
ear
;
"
my
name
's
Cap'en
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
would
have
hooked
Perch
gently
to
him
,
but
Mr
Perch
eluded
the
attempt
;
not
so
much
in
design
,
as
in
starting
at
the
sudden
thought
that
such
a
weapon
unexpectedly
exhibited
to
Mrs
Perch
might
,
in
her
then
condition
,
be
destructive
to
that
lady
's
hopes
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
be
so
good
as
just
report
Cap'en
Cuttle
here
,
when
you
get
a
chance
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
I
'll
wait
.
"
  
<EOS>
Saying
which
,
the
Captain
took
his
seat
on
Mr
Perch
's
bracket
,
and
drawing
out
his
handkerchief
from
the
crown
of
the
glazed
hat
,
which
he
jammed
between
his
knees
(
without
injury
to
its
shape
,
for
nothing
human
could
bend
it
)
,
rubbed
his
head
well
all
over
,
and
appeared
refreshed
.
<EOS>
He
subsequently
arranged
his
hair
with
his
hook
,
and
sat
looking
round
the
office
,
contemplating
the
clerks
with
a
serene
respect
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
's
equanimity
was
so
impenetrable
,
and
he
was
altogether
so
mysterious
<EOS>
a
being
,
that
Perch
the
messenger
was
daunted
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
name
was
it
you
said
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Mr
Perch
,
bending
down
over
him
as
he
sat
on
the
bracket
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cap'en
,
"
in
a
deep
hoarse
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr
Perch
,
keeping
time
with
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
said
Mr
Perch
,
in
the
same
tone
,
for
he
caught
it
,
and
could
n't
help
it
;
the
Captain
,
in
his
diplomacy
,
was
so
impressive
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
see
if
he
's
disengaged
now
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
may
be
for
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
my
lad
,
I
wo
n't
detain
him
longer
than
a
minute
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
nodding
with
all
the
weighty
importance
that
he
felt
within
him
.
<EOS>
Perch
,
soon
returning
,
said
,
"
Will
Captain
Cuttle
walk
this
way
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
,
standing
on
the
hearth
-
rug
before
the
empty
fireplace
,
which
was
ornamented
with
a
castellated
sheet
of
brown
paper
,
looked
at
the
Captain
as
he
came
in
,
with
no
very
special
encouragement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Carker
?
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
showing
all
his
teeth
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
liked
his
answering
with
a
smile
;
it
looked
pleasant
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
began
the
Captain
,
rolling
his
eyes
slowly
round
the
little
room
,
and
taking
in
as
much
of
it
as
his
shirt
-
collar
permitted
;
"
I
'm
a
seafaring
man
myself
,
Mr
Carker
,
and
Wal'r
,
as
is
on
your
books
here
,
is
almost
a
son
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Walter
Gay
?
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
showing
all
his
teeth
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wal'r
Gay
it
is
,
"
replied
the
Captain
,
"
right
!
"
<EOS>
The
Captain
's
manner
expressed
a
warm
approval
of
Mr
Carker
's
quickness
of
perception
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
intimate
friend
of
his
and
his
uncle
's
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
you
may
have
heard
your
head
Governor
mention
my
name
?
---
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
with
a
still
wider
demonstration
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
resumed
the
Captain
,
"
I
've
the
pleasure
of
his
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
I
waited
upon
him
down
on
the
Sussex
coast
there
,
with
my
young
friend
Wal'r
,
when
---
in
short
,
when
there
was
a
little
accommodation
wanted
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Captain
nodded
his
head
in
a
manner
that
was
at
once
comfortable
,
easy
,
and
expressive
.
<EOS>
"
You
remember
,
I
dare
say
?
"
  
"
I
think
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
"
I
had
the
honour
of
arranging
the
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
!
"
returned
the
Captain
.
"
<EOS>
Right
again
!
<EOS>
you
had
.
<EOS>
Now
I
've
took
the
liberty
of
coming
here
---
"
  
"
Wo
n't
you
sit
down
?
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
"
returned
the
Captain
,
availing
himself
of
the
offer
.
<EOS>
"
A
man
does
get
more
way
upon
himself
,
perhaps
,
in
his
conversation
,
when
he
sits
down
.
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
take
a
cheer
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
thank
you
,
"
said
the
Manager
,
standing
,
perhaps
from
the
force
of
winter
habit
,
with
his
back
against
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
looking
down
upon
the
Captain
with
an
eye
in
every
tooth
and
gum
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
taken
the
liberty
,
you
were
going
to
say
---
though
it
's
none
---
"
  
"
Thank'ee
kindly
,
my
lad
,
"
returned
the
Captain
:
"
of
coming
here
,
on
account
of
my
friend
Wal'r
.
<EOS>
Sol
Gills
,
his
uncle
,
is
a
man
of
science
,
and
in
science
he
may
be
considered
a
clipper
;
but
he
ai
n't
what
I
should
altogether
call
a
able
seaman
---
not
a
man
of
practice
.
<EOS>
Wal'r
is
as
trim
a
lad
as
ever
stepped
;
but
he
's
a
little
down
by
the
head
in
one
respect
,
and
that
is
modesty
.
<EOS>
Now
what
I
should
wish
to
put
to
you
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
lowering
his
voice
,
and
speaking
in
a
kind
of
confidential
growl
,
"
in
a
friendly
way
,
entirely
between
you
and
me
,
and
for
my
own
private
reckoning
,
'
till
your
head
Governor
has
wore
round
a
bit
,
and
I
can
come
alongside
of
him
,
is
this
.
<EOS>
---
Is
everything
right
and
comfortable
here
,
and
is
Wal'r
out'ard
bound
with
a
pretty
fair
wind
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
now
,
Captain
Cuttle
?
"
returned
Carker
,
gathering
up
his
skirts
and
settling
himself
in
his
position
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
practical
man
;
what
do
you
think
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
acuteness
and
significance
of
the
Captain
's
eye
as
he
cocked
it
in
reply
,
no
words
short
of
those
unutterable
Chinese
words
before
referred
to
could
describe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
Captain
,
unspeakably
encouraged
,
"
what
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
Am
I
right
or
wrong
?
"
  
<EOS>
So
much
had
the
Captain
expressed
in
his
eye
,
emboldened
and
incited
by
Mr
Carker
's
smiling
urbanity
,
that
he
felt
himself
in
as
fair
a
condition
to
put
the
question
,
as
if
he
had
expressed
his
sentiments
with
the
utmost
elaboration
.
  
<EOS>
"
Right
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
"
I
have
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Out'ard
bound
with
fair
weather
,
then
,
I
say
,
"
cried
Captain
Cuttle
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
smiled
assent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wind
right
astarn
,
and
plenty
of
it
,
"
pursued
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
smiled
assent
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
!
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
,
greatly
relieved
and
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
know'd
<EOS>
how
she
headed
,
well
enough
;
I
told
Wal'r
so
.
<EOS>
Thank'ee
,
thank'ee
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Gay
has
brilliant
prospects
,
"
observed
Mr
Carker
,
stretching
his
mouth
wider
yet
:
"
all
the
world
before
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
the
world
and
his
wife
too
,
as
the
saying
is
,
"
returned
the
delighted
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
word
"
wife
"
(
which
he
had
uttered
without
design
)
,
the
Captain
stopped
,
cocked
his
eye
again
,
and
putting
the
glazed
hat
on
the
top
of
the
knobby
stick
,
gave
it
a
twirl
,
and
looked
sideways
at
his
always
smiling
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
bet
a
gill
of
old
Jamaica
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
eyeing
him
attentively
,
"
that
I
know
what
you
're
smiling
at
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
took
his
cue
,
and
smiled
the
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
goes
no
farther
?
"
said
the
Captain
,
making
a
poke
at
the
door
with
the
knobby
stick
to
assure
himself
that
it
was
shut
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
an
inch
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
thinking
of
a
capital
F
perhaps
?
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
did
n't
deny
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anything
about
a
L
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
or
a
O
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
still
smiled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
right
again
?
"
inquired
the
Captain
in
a
whisper
,
with
the
scarlet
circle
on
his
forehead
swelling
in
his
triumphant
joy
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
,
in
reply
,
still
smiling
,
and
now
nodding
assent
,
Captain
Cuttle
rose
and
squeezed
him
by
the
hand
,
assuring
him
,
warmly
,
that
they
were
on
the
same
tack
,
and
that
as
for
him
(
Cuttle
)
he
had
laid
his
course
that
way
all
along
.
"
<EOS>
He
know'd
<EOS>
her
first
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
with
all
the
secrecy
and
gravity
that
the
subject
demanded
,
"
in
an
uncommon
manner
---
you
remember
his
finding
her
in
the
street
when
she
was
a'most
<EOS>
a
babby
<EOS>
---
he
has
liked
her
ever
since
,
and
she
him
,
as
much
as
two
such
youngsters
can
.
<EOS>
We
've
always
said
,
Sol
Gills
and
me
,
that
they
was
cut
out
for
each
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
cat
,
or
a
monkey
,
or
a
hyena
,
or
a
death's
-
head
,
could
not
have
shown
the
Captain
more
teeth
at
one
time
,
than
Mr
Carker
showed
him
at
this
period
of
their
interview
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
general
in
-
draught
that
way
,
"
observed
the
happy
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
Wind
and
water
sets
in
that
direction
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
Look
at
his
being
present
t
"
other
day
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Most
favourable
to
his
hopes
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
at
his
being
towed
along
in
the
wake
of
that
day
!
"
pursued
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
Why
what
can
cut
him
adrift
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
replied
Mr
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
right
again
,
"
returned
the
Captain
,
giving
his
hand
another
squeeze
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
it
is
.
<EOS>
So
!
steady
!
<EOS>
There
's
a
son
gone
:
pretty
little
creetur
.
<EOS>
Ai
n't
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
there
's
a
son
gone
,
"
said
the
acquiescent
Carker
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pass
the
word
,
and
there
's
another
ready
for
you
,
"
quoth
the
Captain
.
"
<EOS>
Nevy
of
a
scientific
uncle
!
<EOS>
Nevy
of
Sol
Gills!Wal'r
!
<EOS>
Wal'r
,
as
is
already
in
your
business
!
<EOS>
And
"
---
said
the
Captain
,
rising
gradually
to
a
quotation
he
was
preparing
for
a
final
burst
,
"
who
---
comes
from
Sol
Gills
's
daily
,
to
your
business
,
and
your
buzzums
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
's
complacency
as
he
gently
jogged
Mr
Carker
with
his
elbow
,
on
concluding
each
of
the
foregoing
short
sentences
,
could
be
surpassed
by
nothing
but
the
exultation
with
which
he
fell
back
and
eyed
him
when
he
had
finished
this
brilliant
display
of
eloquence
and
sagacity
;
his
great
blue
waistcoat
heaving
with
the
throes
of
such
a
masterpiece
,
and
his
nose
in
a
state
of
violent
inflammation
from
the
same
cause
.
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
right
?
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
bending
down
at
the
knees
,
for
a
moment
,
in
an
odd
manner
,
as
if
he
were
falling
together
to
hug
the
whole
of
himself
at
once
,
"
your
views
in
reference
to
Walter
Gay
are
thoroughly
and
accurately
right
.
<EOS>
I
understand
that
we
speak
together
in
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Honour
!
"
interposed
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
Not
a
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
him
or
any
one
?
"
pursued
the
Manager
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
frowned
and
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
merely
for
your
own
satisfaction
and
guidance
---
and
guidance
,
of
course
,
"
repeated
Mr
Carker
,
"
with
a
view
to
your
future
proceedings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
kindly
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
listening
with
great
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
,
that
's
the
fact
.
<EOS>
You
have
hit
the
probabilities
exactly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
with
regard
to
your
head
Governor
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
why
an
interview
had
better
come
about
nat'ral
between
us
.
<EOS>
There
's
time
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
,
with
his
mouth
from
ear
to
ear
,
repeated
,
"
Time
enough
.
"
<EOS>
Not
articulating
the
words
,
but
bowing
his
head
affably
,
and
forming
them
with
his
tongue
and
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
as
I
know
---
it
's
what
I
always
said
---
that
Wal'r
's
in
a
way
to
make
his
fortune
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
make
his
fortune
,
"
Mr
Carker
repeated
,
in
the
same
dumb
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
as
Wal'r
's
going
on
this
little
voyage
is
,
as
I
may
say
,
in
his
day
's
work
,
and
a
part
of
his
general
expectations
here
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
his
general
expectations
here
,
"
assented
Mr
Carker
,
dumbly
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
so
long
as
I
know
that
,
"
pursued
the
Captain
,
"
there
's
no
hurry
,
and
<EOS>
my
mind
's
at
ease
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
still
blandly
assenting
in
the
same
voiceless
manner
,
Captain
Cuttle
was
strongly
confirmed
in
his
opinion
that
he
was
one
of
the
most
agreeable
men
he
had
ever
met
,
and
that
even
Mr
Dombey
might
improve
himself
on
such
a
model
.
<EOS>
With
great
heartiness
,
therefore
,
the
Captain
once
again
extended
his
enormous
hand
(
not
unlike
an
old
block
in
colour
)
,
and
gave
him
a
grip
that
left
upon
his
smoother
flesh
a
proof
impression
of
the
chinks
and
crevices
with
which
the
Captain
's
palm
was
liberally
tattooed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Farewell
!
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
I
an't
a
man
of
many
words
,
but
I
take
it
very
kind
of
you
to
be
so
friendly
,
and
above
-
board
.
<EOS>
You
'll
excuse
me
if
I
've
been
at
all
intruding
,
will
you
?
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
returned
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
.
<EOS>
My
berth
an't
very
roomy
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
turning
back
again
,
"
<EOS>
but
it
's
tolerably
snug
;
and
if
you
was
to
find
yourself
near
Brig
Place
,
number
nine
,
at
any
time
---
will
you
make
a
note
of
it
?
<EOS>
---
and
would
come
up
stairs
,
without
minding
what
was
said
by
the
person
at
the
door
,
I
should
be
proud
to
see
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
hospitable
invitation
,
the
Captain
said
"
Good
day
!
"
and
walked
out
and
shut
the
door
;
leaving
Mr
Carker
still
reclining
against
the
chimney
-
piece
.
<EOS>
In
whose
sly
look
and
watchful
manner
;
in
whose
false
mouth
,
stretched
but
not
laughing
;
in
whose
spotless
cravat
and
very
whiskers
;
even
in
whose
silent
passing
of
his
soft
hand
over
his
white
linen
and
his
smooth
face
;
there
was
something
desperately
cat
-
like
.
  
<EOS>
The
unconscious
Captain
walked
out
in
a
state
of
self
-
glorification
that
imparted
quite
a
new
cut
to
the
broad
blue
suit
.
<EOS>
"
Stand
by
,
Ned
!
"
said
the
Captain
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
done
a
little
business
for
the
youngsters
to
-
day
,
my
lad
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
his
exultation
,
and
in
his
familiarity
,
present
and
prospective
,
with
the
House
,
the
Captain
,
when
he
reached
the
outer
office
,
could
not
refrain
from
rallying
Mr
Perch
a
little
,
and
asking
him
whether
he
thought
everybody
was
still
engaged
.
<EOS>
But
not
to
be
bitter
on
a
man
who
had
done
his
duty
,
the
Captain
whispered
in
his
ear
,
that
if
he
felt
disposed
for
a
glass
of
rum
-
and
-
water
,
and
would
follow
,
he
would
be
happy
to
bestow
the
same
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
Before
leaving
the
premises
,
the
Captain
,
somewhat
to
the
astonishment
of
the
clerks
,
looked
round
from
a
central
point
of
view
,
and
took
a
general
survey
of
the
office
as
part
and
parcel
of
a
project
in
which
his
young
friend
was
nearly
interested
.
<EOS>
The
strong
-
room
excited
his
especial
admiration
;
but
,
that
he
might
not
appear
too
particular
,
he
limited
himself
to
an
approving
glance
,
and
,
with
a
graceful
recognition
of
the
clerks
as
a
body
,
that
was
full
of
politeness
and
patronage
,
passed
out
into
the
court
.
<EOS>
Being
promptly
joined
by
Mr
Perch
,
he
conveyed
that
gentleman
to
the
tavern
,
and
fulfilled
his
pledge
---
hastily
,
for
Perch
's
time
was
precious
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
give
you
for
a
toast
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"

<EOS>
"
Wal'r

repeated
the
Captain
,
in
a
voice
of
thunder
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Perch
,
who
seemed
to
remember
having
heard
in
infancy
that
there
was
once
a
poet
of
that
name
,
made
no
objection
;
but
he
was
much
astonished
at
the
Captain
's
coming
into
the
City
to
propose
to
poet
;
indeed
,
if
he
had
proposed
to
put
a
poet
's
statue
up
---
say
Shakespeare
's
for
example
---
in
a
civic
thoroughfare
,
he
could
hardly
have
done
a
greater
outrage
to
Mr
Perch
's
experience
.
<EOS>
On
the
whole
,
he
was
such
a
mysterious
and
incomprehensible
character
,
that
Mr
Perch
decided
not
to
mention
him
to
Mrs
Perch
at
all
,
in
case
of
giving
rise
to
any
disagreeable
consequences
.
  
<EOS>
Mysterious
and
incomprehensible
,
the
Captain
,
with
that
lively
sense
upon
him
of
having
done
a
little
business
for
the
youngsters
,
remained
all
day
,
even
to
his
most
intimate
friends
;
and
but
that
Walter
attributed
his
winks
and
grins
,
and
other
such
pantomimic
reliefs
of
himself
,
to
his
satisfaction
in
the
success
of
their
innocent
deception
upon
old
Sol
Gills
,
he
would
assuredly
have
betrayed
himself
before
night
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
however
,
he
kept
his
own
secret
;
and
went
home
late
from
the
Instrument
-
maker
's
house
,
wearing
the
glazed
hat
so
much
on
one
side
,
and
carrying
such
a
beaming
expression
in
his
eyes
,
that
Mrs
MacStinger
(
who
might
have
been
brought
up
at
Doctor
Blimber
's
,
she
was
such
a
Roman
matron
)
fortified
herself
,
at
the
first
glimpse
of
him
,
behind
the
open
street
door
,
and
refused
to
come
out
to
the
contemplation
of
her
blessed
infants
,
until
he
was
securely
lodged
in
his
own
room
.

Father
and
Daughter
 
THERE
is
a
hush
through
Mr
Dombey
's
house
.
<EOS>
Servants
gliding
up
and
downstairs
rustle
,
but
make
no
sound
of
footsteps
.
<EOS>
They
talk
together
constantly
,
and
sit
long
at
meals
,
making
much
of
their
meat
and
drink
,
and
enjoying
themselves
after
a
grim
unholy
fashion
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Wickam
,
with
her
eyes
suffused
with
tears
,
relates
melancholy
anecdotes
;
and
tells
them
how
she
always
said
at
Mrs
Pipchin
's
that
it
would
be
so
,
and
takes
more
table
-
ale
tan
usual
,
and
is
very
sorry
but
sociable
.
<EOS>
Cook
's
state
of
mind
is
similar
.
<EOS>
She
promises
a
little
fry
for
supper
,
and
struggles
about
equally
against
her
feelings
and
the
onions
.
<EOS>
Towlinson
begins
to
think
there
's
a
fate
in
it
,
and
wants
to
know
if
anybody
can
tell
him
of
any
good
that
ever
came
of
living
in
a
corner
house
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
all
of
them
as
having
happened
a
long
time
ago
;
though
yet
the
child
lies
,
calm
and
beautiful
,
upon
his
little
bed
.
  
<EOS>
After
dark
there
come
some
visitors
---
noiseless
visitors
,
with
shoes
of
felt
---
who
have
been
there
before
;
and
with
them
comes
that
bed
of
rest
which
is
so
strange
a
one
for
infant
sleepers
.
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
the
bereaved
father
has
not
been
seen
even
by
this
attendant
;
for
he
sits
in
an
inner
corner
of
his
own
dark
room
when
any
one
is
there
,
and
never
seems
to
move
at
other
times
,
except
to
pace
it
to
and
fro
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
morning
it
is
whispered
among
the
household
that
he
was
heard
to
go
up
stairs
in
the
dead
night
,
and
that
he
stayed
there
---
in
the
room
---
until
the
sun
was
shining
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
offices
in
the
City
,
the
ground
-
glass
windows
are
made
more
dim
by
shutters
;
and
while
the
lighted
lamps
upon
the
desks
are
half
extinguished
by
the
day
that
wanders
in
,
the
day
is
half
extinguished
by
the
lamps
,
and
an
unusual
gloom
prevails
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
much
business
done
.
<EOS>
The
clerks
are
indisposed
to
work
;
and
they
make
assignations
to
eat
chops
in
the
afternoon
,
and
go
up
the
river
.
<EOS>
Perch
,
the
messenger
,
stays
long
upon
his
errands
;
and
finds
himself
in
bars
of
public
-
houses
,
invited
thither
by
friends
,
and
holding
forth
on
the
uncertainty
of
human
affairs
.
<EOS>
He
goes
home
to
Ball
's
Pond
earlier
in
the
evening
than
usual
,
and
treats
Mrs
Perch
to
a
veal
cutlet
and
scotch
ale
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
treats
no
one
;
neither
is
he
treated
;
but
alone
in
his
own
room
he
shows
his
teeth
all
day
;
and
it
would
seem
that
there
is
something
gone
from
Mr
Carker
's
path
---
some
obstacle
reremoved
---
which
clears
his
way
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
Now
the
rosy
children
living
opposite
to
Mr
Dombey
's
house
,
peep
from
their
nursery
windows
down
into
the
street
;
for
there
are
four
black
horses
at
his
door
,
with
feathers
on
their
heads
;
and
feathers
tremble
on
the
carriage
that
they
draw
;
and
these
,
and
an
array
of
men
with
scarves
and
staves
,
attract
a
crowd
.
<EOS>
The
juggler
who
was
going
to
twirl
the
basin
,
puts
his
loose
coat
on
again
over
his
fine
dress
;
and
his
trudging
wife
,
one
-
sided
with
her
heavy
baby
in
her
arms
,
loiters
to
see
the
company
come
out
.
<EOS>
But
closer
to
her
dingy
breast
she
presses
her
baby
,
when
the
burden
that
is
so
easily
carried
is
borne
forth
;
and
the
youngest
of
the
rosy
children
at
the
high
window
opposite
,
needs
no
restraining
hand
to
check
her
in
her
glee
,
when
,
pointing
with
her
dimpled
finger
,
she
looks
into
her
nurse
's
face
,
and
asks
"
What
's
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
among
the
knot
of
servants
dressed
in
mourning
,
and
the
weeping
women
,
Mr
Dombey
passes
through
the
hall
to
the
other
carriage
that
is
waiting
to
receive
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
"
brought
down
,
"
these
observes
think
,
by
sorrow
and
distress
of
mind
.
<EOS>
His
walk
is
as
erect
,
his
bearing
is
as
stiff
as
ever
it
has
been
.
<EOS>
He
hides
his
face
behind
no
handkerchief
,
and
looks
before
him
.
<EOS>
But
that
his
face
is
something
sunk
and
rigid
,
and
is
pale
,
it
bears
the
same
expression
as
of
old
.
<EOS>
He
takes
his
place
within
the
carriage
,
and
three
other
gentlemen
follow
.
<EOS>
Then
the
grand
funeral
moves
slowly
down
the
street
.
<EOS>
The
feathers
are
yet
nodding
in
the
distance
,
when
the
juggler
has
the
basin
spinning
on
a
cane
,
and
has
the
same
crowd
to
admire
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
juggler
's
wife
is
less
alert
than
usual
with
the
money
-
box
,
for
a
child
's
burial
<EOS>
has
set
her
thinking
that
perhaps
the
baby
underneath
her
shabby
shawl
may
not
grow
up
to
be
a
man
,
and
wear
a
sky
-
blue
fillet
round
his
head
,
and
salmon
-
coloured
worsted
drawers
,
and
tumble
in
the
mud
.
  
<EOS>
The
feathers
wind
their
gloomy
way
along
the
streets
,
and
come
within
the
sound
of
a
church
bell
.
<EOS>
In
this
same
church
,
the
pretty
boy
received
all
that
will
soon
be
left
of
him
on
earth
---
a
name
.
<EOS>
All
of
him
that
is
dead
,
they
lay
there
,
near
the
perishable
substance
of
his
mother
.
<EOS>
It
is
well
.
<EOS>
Their
ashes
lie
where
Florence
in
her
walks
---
oh
lonely
,
lonely
walks
!
---
may
pass
them
any
day
.
  
<EOS>
The
service
over
,
and
the
clergyman
withdrawn
<EOS>
,
Mr
Dombey
looks
round
,
demanding
in
a
low
voice
,
whether
the
person
who
has
been
requested
to
attend
to
receive
instructions
for
the
tablet
,
is
there
?
  
<EOS>
Some
one
comes
forward
,
and
says
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
intimates
where
he
would
have
it
placed
;
and
shows
him
,
with
his
hand
upon
the
wall
,
the
shape
and
size
;
and
how
it
is
to
follow
the
memorial
to
the
mother
.
<EOS>
Then
,
with
his
pencil
,
he
writes
out
the
inscription
,
and
gives
it
to
him
:
adding
,
"
I
wish
to
have
it
done
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
done
immediately
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
really
nothing
to
inscribe
but
name
and
age
,
you
see
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
bows
,
glancing
at
the
paper
,
but
appears
to
hesitate
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
not
observing
his
hesitation
,
turns
away
,
and
leads
towards
the
porch
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Sir
;
"
a
touch
falls
gently
on
his
mourning
cloak
;
"
but
as
you
wish
it
done
immediately
,
and
it
may
be
put
in
hand
when
I
get
back
---
"
  
"
Well
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
be
so
good
as
read
it
over
again
?
<EOS>
I
think
there
's
a
mistake
'
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
statuary
gives
him
back
the
paper
,
and
points
out
,
with
his
pocket
rule
,
the
words
,
"
beloved
and
only
child
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
should
be
,
"
son
,
"
I
think
,
Sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
.
<EOS>
Of
course
.
<EOS>
Make
the
correction
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
father
,
with
a
hastier
step
,
pursues
his
way
to
the
coach
.
<EOS>
When
the
other
three
,
who
follow
closely
,
take
their
seats
,
his
face
is
hidden
for
the
first
time
---
shaded
by
his
cloak
.
<EOS>
Nor
do
they
see
it
any
more
that
day
.
<EOS>
He
alights
first
,
and
passes
immediately
into
his
own
room
.
<EOS>
The
other
mourners
(
who
are
only
Mr
Chick
,
and
two
of
the
medical
attendants
)
proceed
upstairs
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
to
be
received
by
Mrs
Chick
and
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
And
what
the
face
is
,
in
the
shut
-
up
chamber
underneath
:
or
what
the
thoughts
are
:
what
the
heart
is
,
what
the
contest
or
the
suffering
:
no
one
knows
.
  
<EOS>
The
chief
thing
that
they
know
below
stairs
,
in
the
kitchen
,
is
that
"
it
seems
like
Sunday
.
<EOS>
"
They
can
hardly
persuade
themselves
but
that
there
is
something
unbecoming
,
if
not
wicked
,
in
the
conduct
of
the
people
out
of
doors
,
who
pursue
their
ordinary
occupations
,
and
wear
everyday
attire
.
<EOS>
It
is
quite
a
novelty
to
have
the
blinds
up
,
and
the
shutters
open
:
and
they
make
themselves
dismally
comfortable
over
bottles
of
wine
,
which
are
freely
broached
as
on
a
festival
.
<EOS>
They
are
much
inclines
to
moralise
.
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
proposes
with
a
sigh
,
"
Amendment
to
us
all
"
for
which
,
as
Cook
says
with
another
sigh
,
"
There
's
room
enough
,
God
knows
.
<EOS>
"
In
the
evening
,
Mrs
Chick
and
Miss
Tox
take
to
needlework
again
.
<EOS>
In
the
evening
also
,
Mr
Towlinson
goes
out
to
take
the
air
,
accompanied
by
the
housemaid
,
who
has
not
yet
tried
her
mourning
bonnet
.
<EOS>
They
are
very
tender
to
each
other
at
dusky
street
-
corners
,
and
Towlinson
has
visions
of
leading
an
altered
and
blameless
existence
as
a
serious
greengrocer
in
Oxford
Market
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
sounder
sleep
and
deeper
rest
in
Mr
Dombey
's
house
to
-
night
,
than
there
has
been
for
many
nights
.
<EOS>
The
morning
sun
awakens
the
old
household
,
settled
down
once
more
in
their
old
ways
.
<EOS>
The
rosy
children
opposite
run
past
with
hoops
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
splendid
wedding
in
the
church
.
<EOS>
The
juggler
's
wife
is
active
with
the
money
-
box
in
another
quarter
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
The
mason
sings
and
whistles
as
he
chips
out
P
-
A
-
U
-
L
in
the
marble
slab
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
And
can
it
be
that
in
a
world
so
full
and
busy
<EOS>
,
the
loss
of
one
weak
creature
makes
a
void
in
any
heart
,
so
wide
and
deep
that
nothing
but
the
width
and
depth
of
vast
eternity
can
fill
it
up
!
<EOS>
Florence
,
in
her
innocent
affliction
,
might
have
answered
,
"
Oh

brother

<EOS>
oh
my
dearly
loved
and
loving
brother

<EOS>
Only
friend

companion

my
slighted
childhood

<EOS>
Could
any
less
idea
shed
the
light
already
dawning
on
your
early
grave
,
or
give
birth
to
the
softened
sorrow
that
is
springing
into
life
beneath
this
rain
of
tears

<EOS>
"
My
dear
child

said
Mrs
Chick
,
who
held
it
as
a
duty
incumbent
on
her
,
to
improve
the
occasion
,
"
when
you
are
as
old
as
I
am

<EOS>
"
Which
will
be
the
prime
of
life

"
observed
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
then
,
"
pursued
Mrs
Chick
,
gently
squeezing
Miss
Tox
's
hand
in
acknowledgment
of
her
friendly
remark
,
"
you
will
then
know
that
all
grief
is
unavailing
,
and
that
it
is
our
duty
to
submit
.

<EOS>
"
I
will
try

dear
aunt

<EOS>
I
do
try

answered
Florence
,
sobbing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it

said
Mrs
Chick
,
"
because

my

Miss

pursued
Mrs

,
"
we

<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
,
Lucretia
!
"
returned
Mrs
Chick
.
<EOS>
"
How
very
monstrous
!
<EOS>
Misanthrope
,
is
the
word
I
want
.
<EOS>
The
idea
!
<EOS>
Misplaced
affection
!
<EOS>
I
say
,
if
any
misanthrope
were
to
put
,
in
my
presence
,
the
question
"
Why
were
we
born
?
<EOS>
"
I
should
reply
,
"
To
make
an
effort
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
Very
good
indeed
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
much
impressed
by
the
originality
of
the
sentiment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Unhappily
,
"
pursued
Mrs
Chick
,
"
we
have
a
warning
under
our
own
eyes
.
<EOS>
We
have
but
too
much
reason
to
suppose
,
<EOS>
my
dear
child
,
that
if
an
effort
had
been
made
in
time
,
in
this
family
,
a
train
of
the
most
trying
and
distressing
circumstances
might
have
been
avoided
.
<EOS>
Nothing
shall
ever
persuade
me
,
"
observed
the
good
matron
,
with
a
resolute
air
,
"
but
that
if
that
effort
had
been
made
by
poor
dear
Fanny
,
the
poor
dear
darling
child
would
at
least
have
had
a
stronger
constitution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
abandoned
herself
to
her
feelings
for
half
a
moment
;
but
,
as
a
practical
illustration
of
her
doctrine
,
brought
herself
up
short
,
in
the
middle
of
a
sob
,
and
went
on
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Therefore
,
Florence
,
pray
let
us
see
that
you
have
some
strength
of
mind
,
and
do
not
selfishly
aggravate
the
distress
in
which
your
poor
Papa
is
plunged
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
aunt
!
<EOS>
"
said
Florence
,
kneeling
quickly
down
before
her
,
that
she
might
the
better
and
more
earnestly
look
into
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
more
about
Papa
.
<EOS>
Pray
tell
me
about
him!Is
he
quite
heartbroken
?
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
was
of
a
tender
nature
,
and
there
was
something
in
this
appeal
that
moved
her
very
much
.
<EOS>
Whether
she
saw
it
in
a
succession
,
on
the
part
of
the
neglected
child
,
to
the
affectionate
concern
so
often
expressed
by
her
dead
brother
---
or
a
love
that
sought
to
twine
itself
about
the
heart
that
had
loved
him
,
and
that
could
not
bear
to
be
shut
out
from
sympathy
with
such
a
sorrow
,
in
such
sad
community
of
love
and
grief
---
or
whether
she
only
recognised
the
earnest
and
devoted
spirit
which
,
although
discarded
and
repulsed
,
was
wrung
with
tenderness
long
unreturned
,
and
in
the
waste
and
solitude
of
this
bereavement
cried
to
him
to
seek
a
comfort
in
it
,
and
to
give
some
,
by
some
small
response
---
<EOS>
whatever
may
have
been
her
understanding
of
it
,
it
moved
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
For
the
moment
she
forgot
the
majesty
of
Mrs
Chick
,
and
,
patting
Florence
hastily
on
the
cheek
,
turned
aside
and
suffered
the
tears
to
gush
from
her
eyes
,
without
waiting
for
a
lead
from
that
wise
matron
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
herself
lost
,
for
a
moment
,
the
presence
of
mind
on
which
she
so
much
prided
herself
;
and
remained
mute
,
looking
on
the
beautiful
young
face
that
had
so
long
,
so
steadily
,
and
patiently
,
been
turned
towards
the
little
bed
.
<EOS>
But
recovering
her
voice
---
which
was
synonymous
with
her
presence
of
mind
,
indeed
they
were
one
and
the
same
thing
<EOS>
---
she
replied
with
dignity
:
  
"
Florence
,
my
dear
child
,
your
poor
Papa
is
peculiar
at
times
;
and
to
question
me
about
him
,
is
to
question
me
upon
a
subject
which
I
really
do
not
pretend
to
understand
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
as
much
influence
with
your
Papa
as
anybody
has
.
<EOS>
Still
,
all
I
can
say
is
,
that
he
has
said
very
little
to
me
;
and
that
I
have
only
seen
him
once
or
twice
for
a
minute
at
a
time
,
and
indeed
have
hardly
seen
him
then
,
for
his
room
has
been
dark
.
<EOS>
I
have
said
to
your
Papa
,
"
Paul
!
"
<EOS>
---
that
is
the
exact
expression
I
used
---
"
Paul
!
<EOS>
why
do
you
not
take
something
stimulating
?
"
<EOS>
Your
Papa
's
reply
has
always
been
,
"
Louisa
,
have
the
goodness
to
leave
me
.
<EOS>
I
want
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
am
better
by
myself
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
was
to
be
put
upon
my
oath
to
-
morrow
,
Lucretia
,
before
a
magistrate
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
"
I
have
no
doubt
I
could
venture
to
swear
to
those
identical
words
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
expressed
her
admiration
by
saying
,
"
My
Louisa
is
ever
methodical
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
Florence
,
"
resumed
her
aunt
,
"
literally
nothing
has
passed
between
your
poor
Papa
and
myself
,
until
to
-
day
;
when
I
mentioned
to
your
Papa
that
Sir
Barnet
and
Lady
Skettles
had
written
exceedingly
kind
notes
---
our
sweet
boy!Lady
Skettles
loved
him
like
a
<EOS>
---
where
's
my
pocket
handkerchief
?
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
produced
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
Exceedingly
kind
notes
,
proposing
that
you
should
visit
them
for
change
of
scene
.
<EOS>
Mentioning
to
your
Papa
that
I
thought
Miss
Tox
and
myself
might
now
go
home
(
in
which
he
quite
agreed
)
,
I
inquired
if
he
had
any
objection
to
your
accepting
this
invitation
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
"
No
,
Louisa
,
not
the
least
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
Florence
raised
her
tearful
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
the
same
time
,
if
you
would
prefer
staying
here
,
Florence
,
to
paying
this
visit
at
present
,
or
to
going
home
with
me
---
"
  
"
I
should
much
prefer
it
,
aunt
,
"
was
the
faint
rejoinder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
then
,
child
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
"
you
can
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
strange
choice
,
I
must
say
.
<EOS>
But
you
always
were
strange
.
<EOS>
Anybody
else
at
your
time
of
life
,
and
after
what
has
passed
---
my
dear
Miss
Tox
,
I
have
lost
my
pocket
handkerchief
again
---
would
be
glad
to
leave
here
,
one
would
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
should
not
life
to
feel
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
as
if
the
house
was
avoided
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
like
to
think
that
the
---
his
---
the
rooms
up
stairs
were
quite
empty
and
dreary
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
stay
here
,
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
Oh
my
brother
!
<EOS>
oh
my
brother
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
natural
emotion
,
not
to
be
suppressed
;
and
it
would
make
way
even
between
the
fingers
of
the
hands
with
which
she
covered
up
her
face
.
<EOS>
The
overcharged
and
heavy
-
laden
breast
must
sometimes
have
that
vent
,
or
the
poor
wounded
solitary
heart
within
it
would
have
fluttered
like
a
bird
with
broken
wings
,
and
sunk
down
in
the
dust
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
child
!
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
after
a
pause
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
on
any
account
say
anything
unkind
to
you
,
and
that
I
'm
sure
you
know
.
<EOS>
You
will
remain
here
,
then
,
and
do
exactly
as
you
like
.
<EOS>
No
one
will
interfere
with
you
,
Florence
,
or
wish
to
interfere
with
you
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
shook
her
head
in
sad
assent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
sooner
begun
to
advise
your
poor
Papa
that
he
really
ought
to
seek
some
distraction
and
restoration
in
a
temporary
change
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
"
than
he
told
me
he
had
already
formed
the
intention
of
going
into
the
country
for
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
hope
he
'll
go
very
soon
.
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
go
too
soon
.
<EOS>
But
I
suppose
there
are
some
arrangements
connected
with
his
private
papers
and
so
forth
,
consequent
on
the
affliction
that
has
tried
us
all
so
much
---
I
ca
n't
think
what
's
become
of
mine
:
Lucretia
,
lend
me
yours
,
my
dear
---
that
may
occupy
him
for
one
or
two
evenings
in
his
own
room
.
<EOS>
Your
papa
's
a
Dombey
,
child
,
if
ever
there
was
one
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
drying
both
her
eyes
at
once
with
great
care
on
opposite
corners
of
Miss
Tox
's
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
'll
make
an
effort
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
fear
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
nothing
,
aunt
,
"
said
Florence
,
trembling
,
"
I
might
do
to
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
,
my
dear
child
,
"
interposed
Mrs
Chick
,
hastily
,
"
what
are
you
talking
about
?
<EOS>
If
your
Papa
said
to
Me
---
I
have
given
you
his
exact
words
,
"
Louisa
,
I
want
nothing
;
I
am
better
by
myself
"
---
what
do
you
think
he
'd
say
to
you
?
<EOS>
You
must
n't
show
yourself
to
him
,
child
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
dream
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aunt
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
I
will
go
and
lie
down
on
my
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
approved
of
this
resolution
,
and
dismissed
her
with
a
kiss
.
<EOS>
But
Miss
Tox
,
on
a
faint
pretence
of
looking
for
the
mislaid
handkerchief
,
went
upstairs
after
her
;
and
tried
in
a
few
stolen
minutes
to
comfort
her
,
in
spite
of
great
discouragement
from
Susan
Nipper
.
<EOS>
For
Miss
Nipper
,
in
her
burning
zeal
,
disparaged
Miss
Tox
as
a
crocodile
;
yet
her
sympathy
seemed
genuine
,
and
had
at
least
the
vantage
-
ground
of
disinterestedness
---
there
was
little
favour
to
be
won
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
And
was
there
no
one
nearer
and
dearer
than
Susan
,
to
uphold
the
striving
heart
in
its
anguish
?
<EOS>
Was
there
no
other
neck
to
clasp
;
<EOS>
no
other
face
to
turn
to
?
<EOS>
no
one
else
to
say
a
soothing
word
to
such
deep
sorrow
?
<EOS>
Was
Florence
so
alone
in
the
bleak
world
that
nothing
else
remained
to
her
?
<EOS>
Nothing
.
<EOS>
Stricken
motherless
and
brotherless
at
once
---
for
in
the
loss
of
little
Paul
,
that
first
and
greatest
loss
fell
heavily
upon
her
---
this
was
the
only
help
she
had
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
who
can
tell
how
much
she
needed
help
at
first
!
  
<EOS>
At
first
,
when
the
house
subsided
into
its
accustomed
course
,
and
they
had
all
gone
away
,
except
the
servants
,
and
her
father
shut
up
in
his
own
rooms
,
Florence
could
do
nothing
but
weep
,
and
wander
up
and
down
,
and
sometimes
,
in
a
sudden
pang
of
desolate
remembrance
,
fly
to
her
own
chamber
,
wring
her
hands
,
lay
her
face
down
on
her
bed
,
and
know
no
consolation
:
nothing
but
the
bitterness
and
cruelty
of
grief
.
<EOS>
This
commonly
ensued
upon
the
recognition
of
some
spot
or
object
very
tenderly
associated
with
him
;
and
it
made
the
miserable
house
,
at
first
,
a
place
of
agony
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
in
the
nature
of
pure
love
to
burn
so
fiercely
and
unkindly
long
.
<EOS>
The
flame
that
in
its
grosser
composition
has
the
taint
of
earth
,
may
prey
upon
the
breast
that
gives
it
shelter
;
but
the
sacred
fire
from
heaven
is
as
gentle
in
the
heart
,
as
when
it
rested
on
the
heads
of
the
assembled
twelve
,
and
showed
each
man
his
brother
,
brightened
and
unhurt
.
<EOS>
The
image
conjured
up
,
there
soon
returned
the
placid
face
,
the
softened
voice
,
the
loving
looks
,
the
quiet
trustfulness
and
peace
;
and
Florence
,
though
she
wept
still
,
wept
more
tranquilly
,
and
courted
the
remembrance
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
very
long
before
the
golden
water
,
dancing
on
the
wall
,
in
the
old
place
,
at
the
old
serene
time
,
had
her
calm
eye
fixed
upon
it
as
it
ebbed
away
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
very
long
before
that
room
again
knew
her
,
often
;
sitting
there
alone
,
as
patient
and
as
mild
as
when
she
had
watched
beside
the
little
bed
.
<EOS>
When
any
sharp
sense
of
its
being
empty
smote
upon
her
,
she
could
kneel
beside
it
,
and
<EOS>
prayGOD
<EOS>
---
it
was
the
pouring
out
of
her
full
heart
---
to
let
one
angel
love
her
and
remember
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
very
long
before
,
in
the
midst
of
the
dismal
house
so
wide
and
dreary
,
her
low
voice
in
the
twilight
,
slowly
and
stopping
sometimes
,
touched
the
old
air
to
which
he
had
so
often
listened
,
with
his
drooping
head
upon
her
arm
.
<EOS>
And
after
that
,
and
when
it
was
quite
dark
,
a
little
strain
of
music
trembled
in
the
room
:
so
softly
played
and
sung
,
that
it
was
more
like
the
mournful
recollection
of
what
she
had
done
at
his
request
on
that
last
night
,
than
the
reality
repeated
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
repeated
,
often
---
very
often
,
in
the
shadowy
solitude
;
and
broken
murmurs
of
the
strain
still
trembled
on
the
keys
,
when
the
sweet
voice
was
hushed
in
tears
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
she
gained
heart
to
look
upon
the
work
with
which
her
fingers
had
been
busy
by
his
side
on
the
sea
-
shore
;
and
thus
it
was
not
very
long
before
she
took
to
it
again
---
with
something
of
a
human
love
for
it
,
as
if
it
had
been
sentient
and
had
known
him
;
and
,
sitting
in
a
window
,
near
her
mother
's
picture
,
in
the
unused
room
so
long
deserted
,
wore
away
the
thoughtful
hours
.
  
<EOS>
Why
did
the
dark
eyes
turn
so
often
from
this
work
to
where
the
rosy
children
lived
?
<EOS>
They
were
not
immediately
suggestive
of
her
loss
;
for
they
were
all
girls
:
four
little
sisters
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
motherless
like
her
---
and
had
a
father
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
easy
to
know
when
he
had
gone
out
and
was
expected
home
,
for
the
elder
child
was
always
dressed
and
waiting
for
him
at
the
drawing
-
room
window
,
or
in
the
balcony
;
and
when
he
appeared
,
her
expectant
face
lighted
up
with
joy
,
while
the
others
at
the
high
window
,
and
always
on
the
watch
too
,
clapped
their
hands
,
and
drummed
them
on
the
sill
,
and
called
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
elder
child
would
come
down
to
the
hall
,
and
put
her
hand
in
his
,
and
lead
him
up
the
stairs
;
and
Florence
would
see
her
afterwards
sitting
by
his
side
,
or
on
his
knee
,
or
hanging
coaxingly
about
his
neck
and
talking
to
him
:
and
though
they
were
always
gay
together
,
he
would
often
watch
her
face
as
if
he
thought
her
like
her
mother
that
was
dead
.
<EOS>
Florence
would
sometimes
look
no
more
at
this
,
and
bursting
into
tears
would
hide
behind
the
curtain
as
if
she
were
frightened
,
or
would
hurry
from
the
window
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
could
not
help
returning
;
and
her
work
would
soon
fall
unheeded
from
her
hands
again
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
house
that
had
been
empty
,
years
ago
,
It
had
remained
so
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
and
while
she
had
been
away
from
home
,
this
family
had
taken
it
;
and
it
was
repaired
and
newly
painted
;
and
there
were
birds
and
flowers
about
it
;
and
it
looked
very
different
from
its
old
self
.
<EOS>
But
she
never
thought
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
children
and
their
father
were
all
in
all
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
dined
,
she
could
see
them
,
through
the
open
windows
,
go
down
with
their
governess
or
nurse
,
and
cluster
round
the
table
;
and
in
the
still
summer
weather
,
the
sound
of
their
childish
voices
and
clear
laughter
would
come
ringing
across
the
street
,
into
the
drooping
air
of
the
room
in
which
she
sat
.
<EOS>
Then
they
would
climb
and
clamber
up
stairs
with
him
,
and
romp
about
him
on
the
sofa
,
or
group
themselves
at
his
knee
,
a
very
nosegay
of
little
faces
,
while
he
seemed
to
tell
them
some
story
.
<EOS>
Or
they
would
come
running
out
into
the
balcony
;
and
then
Florence
would
hide
herself
quickly
,
lest
it
should
check
them
in
their
joy
,
to
see
her
in
her
black
dress
,
sitting
there
alone
.
  
<EOS>
The
elder
child
remained
with
her
father
when
the
rest
had
gone
away
,
and
made
his
tea
for
him
---
<EOS>
happy
little
housekeeper
<EOS>
she
was
then
!
<EOS>
---
and
sat
conversing
with
him
,
sometimes
at
the
window
,
sometimes
in
the
room
,
until
the
candles
came
.
<EOS>
He
made
her
his
companion
,
though
she
was
some
years
younger
than
Florence
;
and
she
could
be
as
staid
and
pleasantly
demure
,
with
her
little
book
or
work
-
box
,
as
a
woman
.
<EOS>
When
they
had
candles
,
Florence
from
her
own
dark
room
was
not
afraid
to
look
again
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
time
came
for
the
child
to
say
"
Good
night
,
papa
,
"
and
go
to
bed
,
Florence
would
sob
and
tremble
as
she
raised
her
face
to
him
,
and
could
look
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Though
still
she
would
turn
,
again
and
again
,
before
going
to
bed
herself
,
from
the
simple
air
that
had
lulled
him
to
rest
so
often
,
long
ago
,
and
from
the
other
low
soft
broken
strain
of
music
,
back
to
that
house
.
<EOS>
But
that
she
ever
thought
of
it
,
or
watched
it
,
was
a
secret
which
she
kept
within
her
own
young
breast
.
  
<EOS>
And
did
that
breast
of
Florence
---
<EOS>
Florence
,
so
ingenuous
and
true
---
so
worthy
of
the
love
that
he
had
borne
her
,
and
had
whispered
in
his
last
faint
words
---
whose
guileless
heart
was
mirrored
in
the
beauty
of
her
face
,
and
breathed
in
every
accent
of
her
gentle
voice
---
did
that
young
breast
hold
any
other
secret
?
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
One
more
.
  
<EOS>
When
no
one
in
the
house
was
stirring
,
and
the
lights
were
all
extinguished
,
she
would
softly
leave
her
own
room
,
and
with
noiseless
feet
descend
the
staircase
,
and
approach
her
father
's
door
.
<EOS>
Against
it
,
scarcely
breathing
,
she
would
rest
her
face
and
head
,
and
press
her
lips
,
in
the
yearning
of
her
love
.
<EOS>
She
crouched
upon
the
cold
stone
floor
outside
it
,
every
night
,
to
listen
even
for
his
breath
;
and
in
her
one
absorbing
wish
to
be
allowed
to
show
him
some
affection
,
to
be
a
consolation
to
him
,
to
win
him
over
to
the
endurance
of
some
tenderness
from
her
,
his
solitary
child
,
she
would
have
knelt
down
at
his
feet
,
if
she
had
dared
,
in
humble
supplication
.
  
<EOS>
No
one
knew
it
.
<EOS>
No
one
thought
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
ever
closed
,
and
he
shut
up
within
.
<EOS>
He
went
out
once
or
twice
,
and
it
was
said
in
the
house
that
he
was
very
soon
going
on
his
country
journey
;
but
he
lived
in
those
rooms
,
and
lived
alone
,
and
never
saw
her
,
or
inquired
for
her
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
did
not
even
know
that
she
was
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
,
about
a
week
after
the
funeral
,
Florence
was
sitting
at
her
work
,
when
Susan
appeared
,
with
a
face
half
laughing
and
half
crying
to
announce
a
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
visitor
!
<EOS>
To
me
,
Susan
!
"
said
Florence
,
looking
up
in
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
is
a
wonder
,
ai
n't
it
now
,
Miss
Floy
?
"
said
Susan
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
wish
you
had
a
many
visitors
<EOS>
,
I
do
,
indeed
,
for
you
'd
be
all
the
better
for
it
,
and
it
's
my
opinion
that
the
sooner
you
and
me
goes
even
to
them
<EOS>
old
Skettleses
,
Miss
,
the
better
for
both
<EOS>
,
I
may
not
wish
to
live
in
crowds
,
Miss
Floy
,
but
still
I
'm
not
a
oyster
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
do
Miss
Nipper
justice
,
she
spoke
more
for
her
young
mistress
than
herself
;
and
her
face
showed
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
visitor
,
Susan
,
"
said
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
Susan
,
with
an
hysterical
explosion
that
was
as
much
a
laugh
as
a
sob
,
and
as
much
a
sob
as
a
laugh
,
answered
,
  
"
Mr
Toots
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
smile
that
appeared
on
Florence
's
face
passed
from
it
in
a
moment
,
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
<EOS>
But
at
any
rate
it
was
a
smile
,
and
that
gave
great
satisfaction
to
Miss
Nipper
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
own
feelings
exactly
,
Miss
Floy
,
"
said
Susan
,
putting
her
apron
to
her
eyes
,
and
shaking
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
Immediately
I
see
that
Innocent
in
the
Hall
,
Miss
Floy
<EOS>
,
I
burst
out
laughing
first
,
and
then
I
choked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Susan
Nipper
involuntarily
proceeded
to
do
the
like
again
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Mr
Toots
,
who
had
come
up
stairs
after
her
,
all
unconscious
of
the
effect
he
produced
,
announced
himself
with
his
knuckles
on
the
door
,
and
walked
in
very
briskly
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
d'ye
do
,
Miss
Dombey
?
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
well
,
I
thank
you
;
how
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
---
than
whom
there
were
few
better
fellows
in
the
world
,
though
there
may
have
been
one
or
two
brighter
spirits
---
had
laboriously
invented
this
long
burst
of
discourse
with
the
view
of
relieving
the
feelings
both
of
Florence
and
himself
.
<EOS>
But
finding
that
he
had
run
through
his
property
,
as
it
were
,
in
an
injudicious
manner
,
by
squandering
the
whole
before
taking
a
chair
,
or
before
Florence
had
uttered
a
word
,
or
before
he
had
well
got
in
at
the
door
,
he
deemed
it
advisable
to
begin
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
d'ye
do
,
Miss
Dombey
?
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
well
,
I
thank
you
;
how
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
gave
him
her
hand
,
and
said
she
was
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
well
indeed
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
taking
a
chair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
indeed
,
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
remember
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
after
reflecting
a
little
,
"
that
I
was
ever
better
,
thank
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
kind
of
you
to
come
,
"
said
Florence
,
taking
up
her
work
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
responded
with
a
chuckle
.
<EOS>
Thinking
that
might
be
too
lively
,
he
corrected
it
with
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
Thinking
that
might
be
too
melancholy
,
he
corrected
it
with
a
chuckle
.
<EOS>
Not
thoroughly
pleasing
himself
with
either
mode
of
reply
,
he
breathed
hard
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
very
kind
to
my
dear
brother
,
"
said
Florence
,
obeying
her
own
natural
impulse
to
relieve
him
by
saying
so
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
often
talked
to
me
about
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
of
no
consequence
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Warm
,
ai
n't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
beautiful
weather
,
"
replied
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
agrees
with
me
!
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
was
so
well
as
I
find
myself
at
present
,
I
'm
obliged
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
stating
this
curious
and
unexpected
fact
,
Mr
Toots
fell
into
a
deep
well
of
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
left
Dr
Blimber
's
,
I
think
?
"
said
Florence
,
trying
to
help
him
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
hope
so
,
"
returned
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
And
tumbled
in
again
.
  
<EOS>
He
remained
at
the
bottom
,
apparently
drowned
,
for
at
least
ten
minutes
.
<EOS>
At
the
expiration
of
that
period
,
he
suddenly
floated
,
and
said
,
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Good
morning
,
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Florence
,
rising
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
though
.
<EOS>
No
,
not
just
at
present
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
sitting
down
again
,
most
unexpectedly
.
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
---
I
say
,
Miss
Dombey
!
"
  
"
Do
n't
be
afraid
to
speak
to
me
,
"
said
Florence
,
with
a
quiet
smile
,
"
I
should
be
very
glad
if
you
would
talk
about
my
brother
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
,
though
?
"
retorted
Mr
Toots
,
with
sympathy
in
every
fibre
of
his
otherwise
expressionless
face
.
"
Poor
Dombey
!
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
never
thought
that
Burgess
and
Co.
---
fashionable
tailors
(
but
very
dear
)
,
that
we
used
to
talk
about
---
would
make
this
suit
of
clothes
for
such
a
purpose
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
was
dressed
in
mourning
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Dombey
!
<EOS>
I
say
!
<EOS>
Miss
Dombey
!
"
<EOS>
blubbered
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
friend
he
took
to
very
much
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
'd
like
to
have
him
,
perhaps
,
as
a
sort
of
keepsake
.
<EOS>
You
remember
his
remembering
Diogenes
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
!
<EOS>
oh
yes
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Dombey
!
<EOS>
So
do
I
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
seeing
Florence
in
tears
,
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
beyond
this
point
,
and
had
nearly
tumbled
into
the
well
again
.
<EOS>
But
a
chuckle
saved
him
on
the
brink
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
he
proceeded
,
"
Miss
Dombey
!
<EOS>
I
could
have
had
him
stolen
for
ten
shillings
,
if
they
had
n't
given
him
up
:
<EOS>
and
I
would
:
<EOS>
but
they
were
glad
to
get
rid
of
him
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
If
you
'd
like
to
have
him
,
he
's
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
brought
him
on
purpose
for
you
.
<EOS>
He
ai
n't
a
lady
's
dog
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
but
you
wo
n't
mind
that
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
fact
Diogenes
was
at
that
moment
,
as
they
presently
ascertained
from
looking
down
into
the
street
,
staring
through
the
window
of
a
hackney
cabriolet
,
into
which
,
for
conveyance
to
that
spot
,
he
had
been
ensnared
,
on
a
false
pretence
of
rats
among
the
straw
.
<EOS>
Sooth
to
say
,
he
was
as
unlike
a
lady
's
dog
as
might
be
;
and
in
his
gruff
anxiety
to
get
out
,
presented
an
appearance
sufficiently
unpromising
,
as
he
gave
short
yelps
out
of
one
side
of
his
mouth
,
and
overbalancing
himself
by
the
intensity
of
every
one
of
those
efforts
,
tumbled
down
into
the
straw
,
and
then
sprung
panting
up
again
,
putting
out
his
tongue
,
as
if
he
had
come
express
to
a
Dispensary
to
be
examined
for
his
health
.
  
<EOS>
But
though
Diogenes
was
as
ridiculous
a
dog
as
one
would
meet
with
on
a
summer
's
day
;
a
blundering
,
ill
-
favoured
,
clumsy
,
bullet
-
headed
dog
,
continually
acting
on
a
wrong
idea
that
there
was
an
enemy
in
the
neighbourhood
,
whom
it
was
meritorious
to
bark
at
;
<EOS>
and
though
he
was
far
from
good
-
tempered
,
and
certainly
was
not
clever
,
and
had
hair
all
over
his
eyes
,
and
a
comic
nose
,
and
an
inconsistent
tail
,
and
a
gruff
voice
;
he
was
dearer
to
Florence
,
in
virtue
of
that
parting
remembrance
of
him
,
and
that
request
that
he
might
be
taken
care
of
,
than
the
most
valuable
and
beautiful
of
his
kind
.
<EOS>
So
dear
,
indeed
,
was
this
same
ugly
Diogenes
,
and
so
welcome
to
her
,
that
she
took
the
jewelled
hand
of
Mr
Toots
and
kissed
it
in
her
gratitude
.
<EOS>
And
when
Diogenes
,
released
,
came
tearing
up
the
stairs
and
bouncing
into
the
room
(
such
a
business
as
there
was
first
,
to
get
him
out
of
the
cabriolet
!
)
,
dived
under
all
the
furniture
,
and
wound
a
long
iron
chain
,
that
dangled
from
his
neck
,
round
legs
of
chairs
and
tables
,
and
then
tugged
at
it
until
his
eyes
became
unnaturally
visible
,
in
consequence
of
their
nearly
starting
out
of
his
head
;
and
when
he
growled
at
Mr
Toots
,
who
affected
familiarity
;
and
went
pell
-
mell
at
Towlinson
,
morally
convinced
that
he
was
the
enemy
whom
he
had
barked
at
round
the
corner
all
his
life
and
had
never
seen
yet
;
Florence
was
as
pleased
with
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
miracle
of
discretion
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
was
so
overjoyed
by
the
success
of
his
present
,
and
was
so
delighted
to
see
Florence
bending
down
over
Diogenes
,
smoothing
his
coarse
back
with
her
little
delicate
hand
---
<EOS>
Diogenes
graciously
allowing
it
from
the
first
moment
of
their
acquaintance
---
that
he
felt
it
difficult
to
take
leave
,
and
would
,
no
doubt
,
have
been
a
much
longer
time
in
making
up
his
mind
to
do
so
,
if
he
had
not
been
assisted
by
Diogenes
himself
,
who
suddenly
took
it
into
his
head
to
bay
Mr
Toots
,
and
to
make
short
runs
at
him
with
his
mouth
open
.
<EOS>
Not
exactly
seeing
his
way
to
the
end
of
these
demonstrations
,
and
sensible
that
they
placed
the
pantaloons
constructed
by
the
art
of
Burgess
and
Co.
in
jeopardy
,
Mr
Toots
,
with
chuckles
,
lapsed
out
at
the
door
:
by
which
,
after
looking
in
again
two
or
three
times
,
without
any
object
at
all
,
and
being
on
each
occasion
greeted
with
a
fresh
run
from
Diogenes
,
he
finally
took
himself
off
and
got
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
then
,
Di
!
<EOS>
Dear
Di
!
<EOS>
Make
friends
with
your
new
mistress
.
<EOS>
Let
us
love
each
other
,
Di
!
"
said
Florence
fondling
his
shaggy
head
.
<EOS>
And
Di
,
the
rough
and
gruff
,
as
if
his
hairy
hide
were
pervious
to
the
tear
that
dropped
upon
it
,
and
his
dog
's
heart
melted
as
it
fell
,
put
his
nose
up
to
her
face
,
and
swore
fidelity
.
  
<EOS>
Diogenes
<EOS>
the
man
did
not
speak
plainer
to
Alexander
the
Great
than
Diogenes
<EOS>
the
dog
spoke
to
Florence
.
<EOS>
He
subscribed
to
the
offer
of
his
little
mistress
cheerfully
,
and
devoted
himself
to
her
service
.
<EOS>
A
banquet
was
immediately
provided
for
him
in
a
corner
;
and
when
he
had
eaten
and
drunk
his
fill
,
he
went
to
the
window
where
Florence
was
sitting
,
looking
on
,
rose
up
on
his
hind
legs
,
with
his
awkward
fore
paws
on
her
shoulders
,
licked
her
face
and
hands
,
nestled
his
great
head
against
her
heart
,
and
wagged
his
tail
till
he
was
tired
.
<EOS>
Finally
,
Diogenes
coiled
himself
up
at
her
feet
and
went
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
Although
Miss
Nipper
was
nervous
in
regard
of
dogs
,
and
felt
it
necessary
to
come
into
the
room
with
her
skirts
carefully
collected
about
her
,
as
if
she
were
crossing
a
brook
on
stepping
-
stones
;
also
to
utter
little
screams
and
stand
up
on
chairs
when
Diogenes
stretched
himself
:
she
was
in
her
own
manner
affected
by
the
kindness
of
Mr
Toots
,
and
could
not
see
Florence
so
alive
to
the
attachment
and
society
of
this
rude
friend
of
little
Paul
's
,
without
some
mental
comments
thereupon
that
brought
the
water
to
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
as
a
part
of
her
reflections
,
may
have
been
,
in
the
association
of
ideas
,
connected
with
the
dog
;
but
,
at
any
rate
,
after
observing
Diogenes
and
his
mistress
all
the
evening
,
and
after
exerting
herself
with
much
good
-
will
to
provide
Diogenes
a
bed
in
an
ante
-
chamber
outside
his
mistress
's
door
,
she
said
hurriedly
to
Florence
,
before
leaving
her
for
the
night
:
  
"
Your
Pa
's
a
going
off
,
Miss
Floy
,
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
morning
,
Susan
?
"
  
"
Yes
,
Miss
;
that
's
the
orders
.
<EOS>
Early
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
"
asked
Florence
,
without
looking
at
her
,
"
where
Papa
is
going
,
Susan
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
exactly
,
Miss.
<EOS>
He
's
going
to
meet
that
precious
Major
first
,
and
I
must
say
if
I
was
acquainted
with
any
Major
myself
(
which
Heavens
forbid
)
,
it
should
n't
be
a
blue
one
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
Susan
!
"
urged
Florence
gently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Miss
Floy
,
"
returned
Miss
Nipper
,
who
was
full
of
burning
indignation
,
and
minded
her
stops
even
less
than
usual
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
blue
he
is
,
and
while
I
was
a
Christian
,
although
humble
,
I
would
have
natural
-
coloured
friends
,
or
none
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
appeared
from
what
she
added
and
had
gleaned
downstairs
,
that
Mrs
Chick
had
proposed
the
Major
for
Mr
Dombey
's
companion
,
and
that
Mr
Dombey
,
after
some
hesitation
,
had
invited
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Talk
of
him
being
a
change
,
indeed
!
"
observed
Miss
Nipper
to
herself
with
boundless
contempt
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
's
a
change
give
me
a
constancy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Good
night
,
Susan
,
"
said
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
my
darling
dear
Miss
Floy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
tone
of
commiseration
smote
the
chord
so
often
roughly
touched
,
but
never
listened
to
while
she
or
any
one
looked
on
.
<EOS>
Florence
left
alone
,
laid
her
head
upon
her
hand
,
and
pressing
the
other
over
her
swelling
heart
,
held
free
communication
with
her
sorrows
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
wet
night
;
and
the
melancholy
rain
fell
pattering
and
dropping
with
a
wearied
sound
.
<EOS>
A
sluggish
wind
was
blowing
,
and
went
moaning
round
the
house
,
as
if
it
were
in
pain
or
grief
.
<EOS>
A
shrill
noise
quivered
through
the
trees
.
<EOS>
While
she
sat
weeping
,
it
grew
late
,
and
dreary
midnight
tolled
out
from
the
steeples
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
was
little
more
than
a
child
in
years
---
not
yet
fourteen
---
and
the
loneliness
and
gloom
of
such
an
hour
in
the
great
house
where
Death
had
lately
made
its
own
tremendous
devastation
,
might
have
set
an
older
fancy
brooding
on
vague
terrors
.
<EOS>
But
her
innocent
imagination
was
too
full
of
one
theme
to
admit
them
.
<EOS>
Nothing
wandered
in
her
thoughts
but
love
---
a
wandering
love
,
indeed
,
and
cast
away
---
but
turning
always
to
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
in
the
dropping
of
the
rain
,
the
moaning
of
the
wind
,
the
shuddering
of
the
trees
,
the
striking
of
the
solemn
clocks
,
that
shook
this
one
thought
,
or
diminished
its
interest
.
<EOS>
Her
recollections
of
the
dear
dead
boy
---
and
they
were
never
absent
---
were
itself
;
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
And
oh
,
to
be
shut
out
:
to
be
so
lost
:
never
to
have
looked
into
her
father
's
face
or
touched
him
since
that
hour
!
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
go
to
bed
,
poor
child
,
and
never
had
gone
yet
,
since
then
,
without
making
her
nightly
pilgrimage
to
his
door
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
a
strange
sad
sight
,
to
see
her
now
,
stealing
lightly
down
the
stairs
through
the
thick
gloom
,
and
stopping
at
it
with
a
beating
heart
,
and
blinded
eyes
,
and
hair
that
fell
down
loosely
and
unthought
of
;
and
touching
it
outside
with
her
wet
cheek
.
<EOS>
But
the
night
covered
it
,
and
no
one
knew
.
  
<EOS>
The
moment
that
she
touched
the
door
on
this
night
,
Florence
found
that
it
was
open
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
it
stood
open
,
though
by
but
a
hair's
-
breadth
:
and
there
was
a
light
within
.
<EOS>
The
first
impulse
of
the
timid
child
---
and
she
yielded
to
it
---
was
to
retire
swiftly
.
<EOS>
Her
next
,
to
go
back
,
and
to
enter
;
and
this
second
impulse
held
her
in
irresolution
on
the
stair
-
case
.
  
<EOS>
In
its
standing
open
,
even
by
so
much
as
that
chink
,
there
seemed
to
be
hope
.
<EOS>
There
was
encouragement
in
seeing
a
ray
of
light
from
within
,
stealing
through
the
dark
stern
door
-
way
,
and
falling
in
a
thread
upon
the
marble
floor
.
<EOS>
She
turned
back
,
hardly
knowing
what
she
did
,
but
urged
on
by
the
love
within
her
,
and
the
trial
they
had
undergone
together
,
but
not
shared
:
and
with
her
hands
a
little
raised
and
trembling
,
glided
in
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
sat
at
his
old
table
in
the
middle
room
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
arranging
some
papers
,
and
destroying
others
,
and
the
latter
lay
in
fragile
ruins
before
him
.
<EOS>
The
rain
dripped
heavily
upon
the
glass
panes
in
the
outer
room
,
where
he
had
so
often
watched
poor
Paul
,
a
baby
;
and
the
low
complainings
of
the
wind
were
heard
without
.
  
<EOS>
But
not
by
him
.
<EOS>
He
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
table
,
so
immersed
in
thought
,
that
a
far
heavier
tread
than
the
light
foot
of
his
child
could
make
,
might
have
failed
to
rouse
him
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
turned
towards
her
.
<EOS>
By
the
waning
lamp
,
and
at
the
haggard
hour
,
it
looked
worn
and
dejected
;
and
in
the
utter
loneliness
surrounding
him
,
there
was
an
appeal
to
Florence
that
struck
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
!
<EOS>
Papa
!
<EOS>
speak
to
me
,
dear
Papa
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
started
at
her
voice
,
and
leaped
up
from
his
seat
.
<EOS>
She
was
close
before
him
,
with
extended
arms
,
but
he
fell
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
come
here
?
<EOS>
What
has
frightened
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
If
anything
had
frightened
her
,
it
was
the
face
he
turned
upon
her
.
<EOS>
The
glowing
love
within
the
breast
of
his
young
daughter
froze
before
it
,
and
she
stood
and
looked
at
him
as
if
stricken
into
stone
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
not
one
touch
of
tenderness
or
pity
in
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
one
gleam
of
interest
,
parental
recognition
,
or
relenting
in
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
change
in
it
,
but
not
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
The
old
indifference
and
cold
constraint
had
given
place
to
something
:
what
,
she
never
thought
and
did
not
dare
to
think
,
and
yet
she
felt
it
in
its
force
,
and
knew
it
well
without
a
name
:
that
as
it
looked
upon
her
,
seemed
to
cast
a
shadow
on
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
Did
he
see
before
him
the
successful
rival
of
his
son
,
in
health
and
life
?
<EOS>
Did
he
look
upon
his
own
successful
rival
of
his
son
,
in
that
son
's
affection
?
<EOS>
Did
a
mad
jealousy
and
withered
pride
,
poison
sweet
remembrances
that
should
have
endeared
and
made
her
precious
to
him
?
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
that
it
was
gall
to
him
to
look
upon
her
in
her
beauty
and
her
promise
:
thinking
of
his
infant
boy
!
  
<EOS>
Florence
had
no
such
thoughts
.
<EOS>
But
love
is
quick
to
know
when
it
is
spurned
and
hopeless
:
and
hope
died
out
of
hers
,
as
she
stood
looking
in
her
father
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
,
Florence
,
are
you
frightened
?
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
the
matter
,
that
you
come
here
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
came
,
Papa
---
"
  
"
Against
my
wishes
.
<EOS>
Why
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
saw
he
knew
why
:
it
was
written
broadly
on
his
face
:
and
dropped
her
head
upon
her
hands
with
one
prolonged
low
cry
.
  
<EOS>
Let
him
remember
it
in
that
room
,
years
to
come
.
<EOS>
It
has
faded
from
the
air
,
before
he
breaks
the
silence
.
<EOS>
It
may
pass
as
quickly
from
his
brain
,
as
he
believes
,
but
it
is
there
.
<EOS>
Let
him
remember
it
in
that
room
,
years
to
come
!
  
<EOS>
He
took
her
by
the
arm
.
<EOS>
His
hand
was
cold
,
and
loose
,
and
scarcely
closed
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
tired
,
I
dare
say
,
"
he
said
,
taking
up
the
light
,
and
leading
her
towards
the
door
,
"
and
want
rest
.
<EOS>
We
all
want
rest
.
<EOS>
Go
,
Florence
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
dreaming
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
dream
she
had
had
,
was
over
then
,
God
help
her
!
<EOS>
and
she
felt
that
it
could
never
more
come
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
remain
here
to
light
you
up
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
The
whole
house
is
yours
above
there
,
"
said
her
father
,
slowly
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
its
mistress
now
.
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Still
covering
her
face
,
she
sobbed
,
and
answered
"
Good
night
,
dear
papa
,
"
and
silently
ascended
.
<EOS>
Once
she
looked
back
as
if
she
would
have
returned
to
him
,
but
for
fear
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
momentary
thought
,
too
hopeless
to
encourage
;
and
her
father
stood
there
with
the
light
---
hard
,
unresponsive
,
motionless
---
until
the
fluttering
dress
of
his
fair
child
was
lost
in
the
darkness
.
  
<EOS>
Let
him
remember
it
in
that
room
,
years
to
come
.
<EOS>
The
rain
that
falls
upon
the
roof
:
the
wind
that
mourns
outside
the
door
:
may
have
foreknowledge
in
their
melancholy
sound
.
<EOS>
Let
him
remember
it
in
that
room
,
years
to
come
!
  
<EOS>
The
last
time
he
had
watched
her
,
from
the
same
place
,
winding
up
those
stairs
,
she
had
had
her
brother
in
her
arms
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
move
his
heart
towards
her
now
,
it
steeled
it
:
but
he
went
into
his
room
,
and
locked
his
door
,
and
sat
down
in
his
chair
,
and
cried
for
his
lost
boy
.
  
<EOS>
Diogenes
was
broad
awake
upon
his
post
,
and
waiting
for
his
little
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Di
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
Di
!
<EOS>
Love
me

Diogenes
already
loved
her
for
her
own
,
and
did
n't
care
how
much
he
showed
it
.
<EOS>
So
he
made
himself
vastly
ridiculous
by
performing
a
variety
of
uncouth
bounces
in
the
ante
-
chamber
,
and
concluded
,
when
poor
Florence
was
at
last
asleep
,
and
dreaming
of
the
rosy
children
opposite
,
by
scratching
open
her
bedroom
door
:
rolling
up
his
bed
into
a
pillow
:
lying
down
on
the
boards
,
at
the
full
length
of
his
tether
,
with
his
head
towards
her
:
and
looking
lazily
at
her
,
upside
down
,
out
of
the
tops
of
his
eyes
,
until
from
winking
and
winking
he
fell
asleep
himself
,
and
dreamed
,
with
gruff
barks
,
of
his
enemy

Walter
goes
away
 
THE
Wooden
Midshipman
at
the
Instrument
-
maker
's
door
,
like
the
hard
-
hearted
little
midshipman
he
was
,
remained
supremely
indifferent
to
Walter
's
going
away
,
even
when
the
very
last
day
of
his
sojourn
in
the
back
parlour
was
on
the
decline
.
<EOS>
With
his
quadrant
at
his
round
black
knob
of
an
eye
,
and
his
figure
in
its
old
attitude
of
indomitable
alacrity
,
the
midshipman
displayed
his
elfin
small
-
clothes
to
the
best
advantage
,
and
,
absorbed
in
scientific
pursuits
,
had
no
sympathy
with
worldly
concerns
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
far
the
creature
of
circumstances
,
that
a
dry
day
covered
him
with
dust
,
and
a
misty
day
peppered
him
with
little
bits
of
soot
,
and
a
wet
day
brightened
up
his
tarnished
uniform
for
the
moment
,
and
a
very
hot
day
blistered
him
;
but
otherwise
he
was
a
callous
,
obdurate
,
conceited
midshipman
,
intent
on
his
own
discoveries
,
and
caring
as
little
for
what
went
on
about
him
,
terrestrially
,
as
Archimedes
at
the
taking
of
Syracuse
.
  
<EOS>
Such
a
midshipman
he
seemed
to
be
,
at
least
,
in
the
then
position
of
domestic
affairs
.
<EOS>
Walter
eyed
him
kindly
many
a
time
in
passing
in
and
out
;
and
poor
old
Sol
,
when
Walter
was
not
there
,
would
come
and
lean
against
the
doorpost
,
resting
his
weary
wig
as
near
the
shoe
-
buckles
of
the
guardian
genius
of
his
trade
and
shop
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
But
no
fierce
idol
with
a
mouth
from
ear
to
ear
,
and
a
murderous
visage
made
of
parrot
's
feathers
,
was
ever
more
indifferent
to
the
appeals
of
its
savage
votaries
,
than
was
the
midshipman
to
these
marks
of
attachment
.
  
<EOS>
Walter
's
heart
felt
heavy
as
he
looked
round
his
old
bedroom
,
up
among
the
parapets
and
chimney
-
pots
,
and
thought
that
one
more
night
already
darkening
would
close
his
acquaintance
with
it
,
perhaps
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Dismantled
of
his
little
stock
of
books
and
pictures
,
it
looked
coldly
and
reproachfully
on
him
for
his
desertion
,
and
had
already
a
foreshadowing
upon
it
of
its
coming
strangeness
.
<EOS>
"
A
few
hours
more
,
"
thought
Walter
,
"
and
no
dream
I
ever
had
here
when
I
was
a
schoolboy
will
be
so
little
mine
as
this
old
room
.
<EOS>
The
dream
may
come
back
in
my
sleep
,
and
I
may
return
waking
to
this
place
,
it
may
be
:
but
the
dream
at
least
will
serve
no
other
master
,
and
the
room
may
have
a
score
,
and
every
one
of
them
may
change
,
neglect
,
misuse
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
his
uncle
was
not
to
be
left
alone
in
the
little
back
parlour
,
where
he
was
then
sitting
by
himself
;
for
Captain
Cuttle
,
considerate
in
his
roughness
,
stayed
away
against
his
will
,
purposely
that
they
should
have
some
talk
together
unobserved
:
<EOS>
so
Walter
,
newly
returned
home
from
his
last
day
's
bustle
,
descended
briskly
,
to
bear
him
company
.
  
<EOS>
"
Uncle
,
"
he
said
gaily
,
laying
his
hand
upon
the
old
man
's
shoulder
,
"
what
shall
I
send
you
home
from
Barbados
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hope
,
my
dear
Wally
.
<EOS>
Hope
that
we
shall
meet
again
,
on
this
side
of
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Send
me
as
much
of
that
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
will
,
Uncle
<EOS>
:
I
have
enough
and
to
spare
,
and
I
'll
not
be
chary
of
it
!
<EOS>
And
as
to
lively
turtles
,
and
limes
for
Captain
Cuttle
's
punch
,
and
preserves
for
you
on
Sundays
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
,
why
I
'll
send
you
ship
-
loads
,
Uncle
:
when
I
'm
rich
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
Old
Sol
wiped
his
spectacles
,
and
faintly
smiled
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
Uncle
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Walter
,
merrily
,
and
clapping
him
half
a
dozen
times
more
upon
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
You
cheer
up
me
!
<EOS>
I
'll
cheer
up
you
!
<EOS>
We
'll
be
as
gay
as
larks
to
-
morrow
morning
,
Uncle
,
and
we
'll
fly
as
high
!
<EOS>
As
to
my
anticipations
,
they
are
singing
out
of
sight
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wally
,
my
dear
boy
,
"
returned
the
old
man
,
I
'll
do
my
best
,
I
'll
do
my
best
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
your
best
,
Uncle
,
"
said
Walter
,
with
his
pleasant
laugh
,
"
is
the
best
best
that
I
know
.
<EOS>
You
'll
not
forget
what
you
're
to
send
me
,
Uncle
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Wally
,
no
,
"
replied
the
old
man
;
"
everything
I
hear
about
Miss
Dombey
,
now
that
she
is
left
alone
,
poor
lamb
,
I
'll
write
.
<EOS>
I
fear
it
wo
n't
be
much
though
,
Wally
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
Uncle
,
"
said
Walter
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
"
I
have
just
been
up
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
ay
?
<EOS>
"
murmured
the
old
man
,
raising
his
eyebrows
,
and
his
spectacles
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
to
see
her
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
though
I
could
have
seen
her
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
if
I
had
asked
,
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
being
out
of
town
:
but
to
say
a
parting
word
to
Susan
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
might
venture
to
do
that
,
you
know
,
under
the
circumstances
,
and
remembering
when
I
saw
Miss
Dombey
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
boy
,
yes
,
"
replied
his
Uncle
,
rousing
himself
from
a
temporary
abstraction
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
saw
her
,
"
pursued
Walter
,
"
<EOS>
Susan
,
I
mean
:
and
I
told
her
I
was
off
and
away
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
Uncle
,
that
you
had
always
had
an
interest
in
Miss
Dombey
since
that
night
when
she
was
here
,
and
always
wished
her
well
and
happy
,
and
always
would
be
proud
and
glad
to
serve
her
in
the
least
<EOS>
:
I
thought
I
might
say
that
,
you
know
,
under
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
boy
,
yes
,
"
replied
his
Uncle
,
in
the
tone
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
added
,
"
pursued
Walter
,
"
that
if
she
---
Susan
,
I
mean
---
could
ever
let
you
know
,
either
through
herself
,
or
Mrs
Richards
,
or
anybody
else
who
might
be
coming
this
way
,
that
Miss
Dombey
was
well
and
happy
,
you
would
take
it
very
kindly
,
and
would
write
so
much
to
me
,
and
I
should
take
it
very
kindly
too
.
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
Uncle
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
I
scarcely
slept
all
last
night
through
thinking
of
doing
this
;
and
could
not
make
up
my
kind
when
I
was
out
,
whether
to
do
it
or
not
;
and
yet
I
am
sure
it
is
the
true
feeling
of
my
heart
,
and
I
should
have
been
quite
miserable
afterwards
if
I
had
not
relieved
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
honest
voice
and
manner
corroborated
what
he
said
,
and
quite
established
its
ingenuousness
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
,
if
you
ever
see
her
,
Uncle
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
I
mean
Miss
Dombey
now
---
and
perhaps
you
may
,
who
knows
!
<EOS>
---
tell
her
how
much
I
felt
for
her
;
how
much
I
used
to
think
of
her
when
I
was
here
;
how
I
spoke
of
her
,
with
the
tears
in
my
eyes
,
uncle
,
on
this
last
night
before
I
went
away
.
<EOS>
Tell
her
that
I
said
I
never
could
forget
her
gentle
manner
,
or
her
beautiful
face
,
or
her
sweet
kind
disposition
that
was
better
than
all
.
<EOS>
And
as
I
did
n't
take
them
from
a
woman
's
feet
,
or
a
young
lady
's
:
only
a
little
innocent
child
's
,
"
said
Walter
:
<EOS>
"
tell
her
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
,
Uncle
,
that
I
kept
those
shoes
---
she
'll
remember
how
often
they
fell
off
,
that
night
---
and
took
them
away
with
me
as
a
remembrance
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
at
that
very
moment
going
out
at
the
door
in
one
of
Walter
's
trunks
.
<EOS>
A
porter
carrying
off
his
baggage
on
a
truck
for
shipment
at
the
docks
on
board
the
Son
and
Heir
,
had
got
possession
of
them
;
and
wheeled
them
away
under
the
very
eye
of
the
insensible
Midshipman
before
their
owner
had
well
finished
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
But
that
ancient
mariner
might
have
been
excused
his
insensibility
to
the
treasure
as
it
rolled
away
.
<EOS>
For
,
under
his
eye
at
the
same
moment
,
accurately
within
his
range
of
observation
,
coming
full
into
the
sphere
of
his
startled
and
intensely
wide
-
awake
look
-
out
,
were
Florence
and
Susan
Nipper
:
Florence
looking
up
into
his
face
half
timidly
,
and
receiving
the
whole
shock
of
his
wooden
ogling
!
  
<EOS>
More
than
this
,
they
passed
into
the
shop
,
and
passed
in
at
the
parlour
door
before
they
were
observed
by
anybody
but
the
Midshipman
.
<EOS>
And
Walter
,
having
his
back
to
the
door
,
would
have
known
nothing
of
their
apparition
even
then
,
but
for
seeing
his
uncle
spring
out
of
his
own
chair
,
and
nearly
tumble
over
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Uncle
!
"
exclaimed
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
Old
Solomon
replied
,
"
Miss
Dombey
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Walter
,
looking
round
and
starting
up
in
his
turn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
!
"
  
Why
,
it
was
so
possible
and
so
actual
,
that
,
while
the
words
were
on
his
lips
,
Florence
hurried
past
him
;
took
Uncle
Sol
's
snuff
-
coloured
lappels
,
one
in
each
hand
;
kissed
him
on
the
cheek
;
and
turning
,
gave
her
hand
to
Walter
with
a
simple
truth
and
earnestness
that
was
her
own
,
and
no
one
else
's
in
the
world
!
  
<EOS>
"
Going
away
,
Walter
!
"
said
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Miss
Dombey
,
"
he
replied
,
but
not
so
hopefully
as
he
endeavoured
:
"
I
have
a
voyage
before
me
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
your
Uncle
,
"
said
Florence
,
looking
back
at
Solomon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
sorry
you
are
going
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
see
he
is
!
<EOS>
Dear
Walter
,
I
am
very
sorry
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Goodness
knows
,
"
exclaimed
Miss
Nipper
,
"
there
's
a
many
we
could
spare
instead
,
if
numbers
is
a
object
,
Mrs
Pipchin
as
a
overseer
would
come
cheap
at
her
weight
in
gold
,
and
if
a
knowledge
of
black
slavery
should
be
required
,
them
Blimbers
is
the
very
people
for
the
sitiwation
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
Miss
Nipper
untied
her
bonnet
strings
,
and
after
looking
vacantly
for
some
moments
into
a
little
black
teapot
that
was
set
forth
with
the
usual
homely
service
on
the
table
,
shook
her
head
and
a
tin
canister
,
and
began
unasked
to
make
the
tea
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Florence
had
turned
again
to
the
Instrument
-
maker
,
who
was
as
full
of
admiration
as
surprise
.
"
<EOS>
So
grown
!
"
said
old
Sol
.
"
<EOS>
So
improved
!
<EOS>
And
yet
not
altered!Just
the
same
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
"
said
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ye
---
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
returned
old
Sol
,
rubbing
his
hands
slowly
,
and
considering
the
matter
half
aloud
,
as
something
pensive
in
the
bright
eyes
looking
at
him
arrested
his
attention
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
that
expression
was
in
the
younger
face
,
too
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
me
,
"
said
Florence
with
a
smile
,
"
and
what
a
little
creature
I
was
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
young
lady
,
"
returned
the
Instrument
-
maker
,
"
<EOS>
how
could
I
forget
you
,
often
as
I
have
thought
of
you
and
heard
of
you
since
!
<EOS>
At
the
very
moment
,
indeed
,
when
you
came
in
,
Wally
was
talking
about
you
to
me
,
and
leaving
messages
for
you
,
and
---
"
  
"
Was
he
?
"
said
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Walter
!
<EOS>
Oh
thank
you
,
Walter
!
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
you
might
be
going
away
and
hardly
thinking
of
me
;
"
and
again
she
gave
him
her
little
hand
so
freely
<EOS>
and
so
faithfully
that
Walter
held
it
for
some
moments
in
his
own
,
and
could
not
bear
to
let
it
go
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
Walter
did
not
hold
it
as
he
might
have
held
it
once
,
nor
did
its
touch
awaken
those
old
day
-
dreams
of
his
boyhood
that
had
floated
past
him
sometimes
even
lately
,
and
confused
him
with
their
indistinct
and
broken
shapes
.
<EOS>
The
purity
and
innocence
of
her
endearing
manner
,
and
its
perfect
trustfulness
,
and
the
undisguised
regard
for
him
that
lay
so
deeply
seated
in
her
constant
eyes
,
and
glowed
upon
her
fair
face
through
the
smile
that
shaded
---
for
alas
!
<EOS>
it
was
a
smile
too
sad
to
brighten
---
it
,
were
not
of
their
romantic
race
.
<EOS>
They
brought
back
to
his
thoughts
the
early
deathbed
he
had
seen
her
tending
,
and
the
love
the
child
had
borne
her
;
and
on
the
wings
of
such
remembrances
she
seemed
to
rise
up
,
far
above
his
idle
fancies
,
into
clearer
and
serener
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
am
afraid
I
must
call
you
Walter
's
Uncle
,
Sir
,
"
said
Florence
to
the
old
man
,
"
if
you
'll
let
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
young
lady
,
"
cried
old
Sol
.
<EOS>
"
Let
you
!
<EOS>
Good
gracious
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
always
knew
you
by
that
name
,
and
talked
of
you
,
"
said
Florence
,
glancing
round
,
and
sighing
gently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
nice
old
parlour
!
<EOS>
Just
the
same
!
<EOS>
How
well
I
recollect
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Old
Sol
looked
first
at
her
,
then
at
his
nephew
,
and
then
rubbed
his
hands
,
and
rubbed
his
spectacles
,
and
said
below
his
breath
,
"
Ah
!
time
,
time
,
time
!
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
short
silence
:
during
which
Susan
Nipper
skilfully
impounded
two
extra
cups
and
saucers
from
the
cupboard
,
and
awaited
the
drawing
of
the
tea
with
a
thoughtful
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
tell
Walter
's
Uncle
,
"
said
Florence
,
laying
her
hand
timidly
upon
the
old
man
's
as
it
rested
on
the
table
,
to
bespeak
his
attention
,
"
something
that
I
am
anxious
about
.
<EOS>
He
is
going
to
be
left
alone
,
and
if
he
will
allow
me
---
not
to
take
Walter
's
place
,
for
that
I
could
n't
do
,
but
to
be
his
true
friend
and
help
him
if
I
ever
can
while
Walter
is
away
,
I
shall
be
very
much
obliged
to
him
indeed
.
<EOS>
Will
you
?
<EOS>
May
<EOS>
I
,
Walter
's
Uncle
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
Instrument
-
maker
,
without
speaking
,
put
her
hand
to
his
lips
,
and
Susan
Nipper
,
leaning
back
with
her
arms
crossed
,
in
the
chair
of
presidency
into
which
she
had
voted
herself
,
bit
one
end
of
her
bonnet
strings
,
and
heaved
a
gentle
sigh
as
she
looked
up
at
the
skylight
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
let
me
come
to
see
you
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
when
I
can
;
and
you
will
tell
me
everything
about
yourself
and
Walter
;
and
you
will
have
no
secrets
from
Susan
when
she
comes
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
,
but
will
confide
in
us
,
and
trust
us
,
and
rely
upon
us
.
<EOS>
And
you
'll
try
to
let
us
be
a
comfort
to
you
?
<EOS>
Will
you
,
Walter
's
Uncle
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
sweet
face
looking
into
his
,
the
gentle
pleading
eyes
,
<EOS>
the
soft
voice
,
and
the
light
touch
on
his
arm
made
the
more
winning
by
a
child
's
respect
and
honour
for
his
age
,
that
gave
to
all
an
air
of
graceful
doubt
and
modest
hesitation
---
these
,
and
her
natural
earnestness
,
so
overcame
the
poor
old
Instrument
-
maker
,
that
he
only
answered
:
  
"
<EOS>
Wally
!
say
a
word
for
me
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
'm
very
grateful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Walter
,
"
returned
Florence
with
her
quiet
smile
.
<EOS>
"
Say
nothing
for
him
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
understand
him
very
well
,
and
we
must
learn
to
talk
together
without
you
,
dear
Walter
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
regretful
tone
in
which
she
said
these
latter
words
,
touched
Walter
more
than
all
the
rest
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Florence
,
"
he
replied
,
with
an
effort
to
recover
the
cheerful
manner
he
had
preserved
while
talking
with
his
uncle
,
"
I
know
no
more
than
my
uncle
,
what
to
say
in
acknowledgment
of
such
kindness
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
But
what
could
I
say
,
after
all
,
if
I
had
the
power
of
talking
for
an
hour
,
except
that
it
is
like
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Susan
Nipper
began
upon
a
new
part
of
her
bonnet
string
,
and
nodded
at
the
skylight
,
in
approval
of
the
sentiment
expressed
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
but
,
Walter
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
there
is
something
that
I
wish
to
say
to
you
before
you
go
away
,
and
you
must
call
me
Florence
,
if
you
please
,
and
not
speak
like
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Like
a
stranger
!
"
returned
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
speak
so
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
at
least
,
I
could
n't
feel
like
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
but
that
is
not
enough
,
and
is
not
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
For
,
Walter
,
"
added
Florence
,
bursting
into
tears
,
"
he
liked
you
very
much
,
and
said
before
he
died
that
he
was
fond
of
you
,
and
said
"
Remember
Walter
!
"
<EOS>
and
if
you
'll
be
a
brother
to
me
,
Walter
,
now
that
he
is
gone
and
I
have
none
on
earth
,
I
'll
be
your
sister
all
my
life
,
and
think
of
you
like
one
wherever
we
may
be
!
<EOS>
This
is
what
I
wished
to
say
,
dear
Walter
,
but
I
can
not
say
it
as
I
would
,
because
my
heart
is
full
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
in
its
fulness
and
its
sweet
simplicity
,
she
held
out
both
her
hands
to
him
.
<EOS>
Walter
taking
them
,
stooped
down
and
touched
the
tearful
face
that
neither
shrunk
nor
turned
away
,
nor
reddened
as
he
did
so
,
but
looked
up
at
him
with
confidence
and
truth
.
<EOS>
In
that
one
moment
,
every
shadow
of
doubt
or
agitation
passed
away
from
Walter
's
soul
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
responded
to
her
innocent
appeal
,
beside
the
dead
child
's
bed
:
and
,
in
the
solemn
presence
he
had
seen
there
,
pledged
himself
to
cherish
and
protect
her
very
image
,
in
his
banishment
,
with
brotherly
regard
;
to
garner
up
her
simple
faith
,
inviolate
;
and
hold
himself
degraded
if
he
breathed
upon
it
any
thought
that
was
not
in
her
own
breast
when
she
gave
it
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Susan
Nipper
,
who
had
bitten
both
her
bonnet
strings
at
once
,
and
imparted
a
great
deal
of
private
emotion
to
the
skylight
,
during
this
transaction
,
now
changed
the
subject
by
inquiring
who
took
milk
and
who
took
sugar
;
and
being
enlightened
on
these
points
,
poured
out
the
tea
.
<EOS>
They
all
four
gathered
socially
about
the
little
table
,
and
took
tea
under
that
young
lady
's
active
superintendence
;
and
the
presence
of
Florence
in
the
back
parlour
,
brightened
the
Tartar
frigate
on
the
wall
.
  
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
ago
Walter
,
for
his
life
,
would
have
hardly
called
her
by
her
name
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
do
so
now
when
she
entreated
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
think
of
her
being
there
,
without
a
lurking
misgiving
that
it
would
have
been
better
if
she
had
not
come
.
<EOS>
He
could
calmly
think
how
beautiful
she
was
,
how
full
of
promise
,
what
a
home
<EOS>
some
happy
man
would
find
in
such
a
heart
one
day
.
<EOS>
He
could
reflect
upon
his
own
place
in
that
heart
,
with
pride
;
and
with
a
brave
determination
,
if
not
to
deserve
it
---
he
still
thought
that
far
above
him
---
never
to
deserve
it
less
.
  
<EOS>
Some
fairy
influence
must
surely
have
hovered
round
the
hands
of
Susan
Nipper
when
she
made
the
tea
,
engendering
the
tranquil
air
that
reigned
in
the
back
parlour
during
its
discussion
.
<EOS>
Some
counter
-
influence
must
surely
have
hovered
round
the
hands
of
Uncle
Sol
's
chronometer
,
and
moved
them
faster
than
the
Tartar
frigate
ever
went
before
the
wind
.
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
the
visitors
had
a
coach
in
waiting
at
a
quiet
corner
not
far
off
;
and
the
chronometer
,
on
being
incidentally
referred
to
,
gave
such
a
positive
opinion
that
it
had
been
waiting
a
long
time
,
that
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
the
fact
,
especially
when
stated
on
such
unimpeachable
authority
.
<EOS>
If
Uncle
Sol
had
been
going
to
be
hanged
by
his
own
time
,
he
never
would
have
allowed
that
the
chronometer
was
too
fast
,
by
the
least
fraction
of
a
second
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
at
parting
recapitulated
to
the
old
man
all
that
she
had
said
before
,
and
bound
him
to
their
compact
.
<EOS>
Uncle
Sol
attended
her
lovingly
to
the
legs
of
the
Wooden
Midshipman
,
and
there
resigned
her
to
Walter
,
who
was
ready
to
escort
her
and
Susan
Nipper
to
the
coach
.
  
<EOS>
"
Walter
,
"
said
Florence
by
the
way
,
"
I
have
been
afraid
to
ask
before
your
uncle
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
you
will
be
absent
very
long
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
I
fear
so
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
signified
as
much
,
I
thought
,
when
he
appointed
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
a
favour
,
Walter
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Florence
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
and
looking
anxiously
in
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
appointment
?
"
returned
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
Walter
would
have
given
anything
to
have
answered
in
the
affirmative
,
but
his
face
answered
before
his
lips
could
,
and
Florence
was
too
attentive
to
it
not
to
understand
its
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
you
have
scarcely
been
a
favourite
with
papa
,
"
she
said
,
timidly
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
reason
,
"
replied
Walter
,
smiling
,
"
<EOS>
Why
I
should
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
reason
,
Walter
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
reason
,
"
said
Walter
,
understanding
what
she
meant
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
many
people
employed
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Between
Mr
Dombey
and
a
young
man
like
me
,
there
's
a
wide
space
of
separation
.
<EOS>
If
I
do
my
duty
,
I
do
what
I
ought
,
and
do
no
more
than
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Had
Florence
any
misgiving
of
which
she
was
hardly
conscious
:
any
misgiving
that
had
sprung
into
an
indistinct
and
undefined
existence
since
that
recent
night
when
she
had
gone
down
to
her
father
's
room
:
that
Walter
's
accidental
interest
in
her
,
and
early
knowledge
of
her
,
might
have
involved
him
in
that
powerful
displeasure
and
dislike
?
<EOS>
Had
Walter
<EOS>
any
such
idea
,
or
any
sudden
thought
that
it
was
in
her
mind
at
that
moment
?
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
hinted
at
it
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
spoke
at
all
,
for
some
short
time
.
<EOS>
Susan
,
walking
on
the
other
side
of
Walter
,
eyed
them
both
sharply
;
and
certainly
Miss
Nipper
's
thoughts
travelled
in
that
direction
,
and
very
confidently
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
come
back
very
soon
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
perhaps
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
come
back
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
an
old
man
,
and
find
you
an
old
lady
.
<EOS>
But
I
hope
for
better
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
"
said
Florence
,
after
a
moment
,
"
will
---
will
recover
from
his
grief
,
and
---
speak
more
freely
to
me
one
day
,
perhaps
;
and
if
he
should
,
I
will
tell
how
much
I
wish
to
see
you
back
again
,
and
ask
him
to
recall
you
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
touching
modulation
in
these
words
about
her
father
,
that
Walter
understood
too
well
.
  
<EOS>
The
coach
being
close
at
hand
,
he
would
have
left
her
without
speaking
,
for
now
he
felt
what
parting
;
but
Florence
held
his
hand
when
she
was
seated
,
and
then
he
found
there
was
a
little
packet
in
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
Walter
,
"
she
said
,
looking
full
upon
him
with
her
affectionate
eyes
,
"
like
you
,
I
hope
for
better
things
.
<EOS>
I
will
pray
for
them
,
and
believe
that
they
will
arrive
.
<EOS>
I
made
this
little
gift
for
Paul
.
<EOS>
Pray
take
it
with
my
love
,
and
do
not
look
at
it
until
you
are
gone
away
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
God
bless
you
,
Walter!never
forget
me
.
<EOS>
You
are
my
brother
,
dear
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
glad
that
Susan
Nipper
came
between
them
,
or
he
might
have
left
her
with
a
sorrowful
remembrance
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
glad
too
that
she
did
not
look
out
of
the
coach
again
,
but
waved
the
little
hand
to
him
instead
,
as
long
as
he
could
see
it
.
  
<EOS>
In
spite
of
her
request
,
he
could
not
help
opening
the
packet
that
night
when
he
went
to
bed
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
purse
:
and
there
was
money
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
Bright
rose
the
sun
next
morning
,
from
his
absence
in
strange
countries
,
and
up
rose
Walter
with
it
to
receive
the
Captain
,
who
was
already
at
the
door
:
having
turned
out
earlier
than
was
necessary
,
in
order
to
get
under
weigh
while
Mrs
MacStinger
was
yet
slumbering
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
pretended
to
be
in
tip
-
top
spirits
,
and
brought
a
very
smoky
tongue
in
one
of
the
pockets
of
the
broad
blue
coat
for
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
,
Wal'r
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
When
they
took
their
seats
at
table
,
"
if
your
uncle
's
the
man
I
think
him
,
he
'll
bring
out
the
last
bottle
of
the
Madeira
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
Ned
,
"
returned
the
old
man
.
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
That
shall
be
opened
when
Walter
comes
home
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
said
!
"
cried
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
Hear
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
it
lies
,
"
said
Sol
Gills
,
"
down
in
the
little
cellar
,
covered
with
dirt
and
cobwebs
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
dirt
and
cobwebs
over
you
and
me
perhaps
,
Ned
,
before
it
sees
the
light
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hear
him
!
"
cried
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
morality
!
<EOS>
Wal'r
<EOS>
my
lad
.
<EOS>
Train
up
a
fig
-
tree
in
the
way
it
should
go
,
and
when
you
are
old
sit
under
the
shade
on
it
.
<EOS>
Overhaul
<EOS>
the
---
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
the
Captain
on
second
thoughts
,
"
<EOS>
I
an't
quite
certain
<EOS>
where
that
's
to
be
found
,
but
when
found
,
make
a
note
of
.
<EOS>
Sol
Gills
,
heave
ahead
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
,
or
somewhere
,
it
shall
lie
,
Ned
,
until
Wally
comes
back
to
claim
it
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
I
meant
to
say
.
"
  
"
And
well
said
too
,
"
returned
the
Captain
;
"
and
if
we
three
do
n't
crack
that
bottle
in
company
,
I
'll
give
you
two
leave
to
drink
my
allowance
!
"
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
Captain
's
excessive
joviality
,
he
made
but
a
poor
hand
at
the
smoky
tongue
,
though
he
tried
very
hard
,
when
anybody
looked
at
him
,
to
appear
as
if
he
were
eating
with
a
vast
appetite
.
<EOS>
He
was
terribly
afraid
,
likewise
,
of
being
left
alone
with
either
uncle
or
nephew
;
appearing
to
consider
that
his
only
chance
of
safety
as
to
keeping
up
appearances
,
was
in
there
being
always
three
together
.
<EOS>
This
terror
on
the
part
of
the
Captain
,
reduced
him
to
such
ingenious
evasions
as
running
to
the
door
,
when
Solomon
went
to
put
his
coat
on
,
under
pretence
of
having
seen
an
extraordinary
hackney
-
coach
pass
:
and
darting
out
into
the
road
when
Walter
went
up
stairs
to
take
leave
of
the
lodgers
,
on
a
feint
of
smelling
fire
in
a
neighbouring
chimney
.
<EOS>
These
artifices
Captain
Cuttle
deemed
inscrutable
by
any
uninspired
observer
.
  
<EOS>
Walter
was
coming
down
from
his
parting
expedition
up
stairs
,
and
was
crossing
the
shop
to
go
back
to
the
little
parlour
,
when
he
saw
a
faded
face
he
knew
,
looking
in
at
the
door
,
and
darted
towards
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Carker
!
"
cried
Walter
,
pressing
the
hand
of
John
Carker
the
Junior
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
come
in
!
<EOS>
This
is
kind
of
you
,
to
be
here
so
early
to
say
good
-
bye
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
knew
how
glad
it
would
make
me
to
shake
hands
with
you
,
once
,
before
going
away
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
how
glad
I
am
to
have
this
opportunity
.
<EOS>
Pray
come
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
likely
that
we
may
ever
meet
again
,
Walter
,
"
returned
the
other
,
gently
resisting
his
invitation
,
"
and
I
am
glad
of
this
opportunity
too
.
<EOS>
I
may
venture
to
speak
to
you
,
and
to
take
you
by
the
hand
,
on
the
eve
of
separation
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
have
to
resist
your
frank
approaches
,
Walter
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
melancholy
in
his
smile
as
he
said
it
,
that
showed
he
had
found
some
company
and
friendship
for
his
thoughts
even
in
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Mr
Carker
!
"
returned
Walter
,
"
Why
did
your
resist
them
?
<EOS>
You
could
have
done
me
nothing
but
good
,
I
am
very
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
If
there
were
any
good
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
could
do
on
this
earth
,
I
would
do
it
,
Walter
,
for
you
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
you
from
day
to
day
,
has
been
at
once
happiness
and
remorse
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
the
pleasure
has
outweighed
the
pain
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
,
now
,
by
knowing
what
I
lose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
in
,
Mr
Carker
,
and
make
acquaintance
with
my
good
old
uncle
,
"
urged
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
talked
to
him
about
you
,
and
he
will
be
glad
to
tell
you
all
he
hears
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
,
"
said
Walter
,
noticing
his
hesitation
,
and
speaking
with
embarrassment
himself
:
"
<EOS>
I
have
not
told
him
anything
about
our
last
conversation
,
Mr
Carker
;
not
even
him
,
believe
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
grey
Junior
pressed
his
hand
,
and
tears
rose
in
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
ever
make
acquaintance
with
him
,
Walter
,
"
he
returned
,
"
it
will
be
that
I
may
hear
tidings
of
you
.
<EOS>
Rely
on
my
not
wronging
your
forbearance
and
consideration
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
to
wrong
it
,
not
to
tell
him
all
the
truth
,
before
I
sought
a
word
of
confidence
from
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
no
friend
or
acquaintance
except
you
:
and
even
for
your
sake
,
am
little
likely
to
make
any
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
you
had
suffered
me
to
be
your
friend
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
always
wished
it
,
Mr
Carker
,
as
you
know
;
but
never
half
so
much
as
now
,
when
we
are
going
to
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
enough
,
"
replied
the
other
,
"
that
you
have
been
the
friend
of
my
own
breast
,
and
that
when
I
have
avoided
you
most
,
my
heart
inclined
the
most
towards
you
,
and
was
fullest
of
you
.
<EOS>
Walter
,
good
-
bye
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
Mr
Carker
.
<EOS>
Heaven
be
with
you
,
Sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Walter
,
with
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
,
"
said
the
other
,
retaining
his
hand
while
he
spoke
;
"
if
when
you
come
back
,
you
miss
me
from
my
old
corner
,
and
should
hear
from
any
one
where
I
am
lying
,
come
and
look
upon
my
grave
.
<EOS>
Think
that
I
might
have
been
as
honest
and
as
happy
as
you
!
<EOS>
And
let
me
think
,
when
I
know
my
time
is
coming
on
,
that
some
one
like
my
former
self
may
stand
there
,
for
a
moment
,
and
remember
me
with
pity
and
forgiveness!Walter
,
good
-
bye
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
figure
crept
like
a
shadow
down
the
bright
,
sun
-
lighted
street
,
so
cheerful
yet
<EOS>
so
solemn
in
the
early
summer
morning
;
and
slowly
passed
away
.
  
<EOS>
The
relentless
chronometer
at
last
announced
that
Walter
must
turn
his
back
upon
the
Wooden
Midshipman
:
<EOS>
and
away
they
went
,
himself
,
his
uncle
,
and
the
Captain
,
in
a
hackney
-
coach
to
a
wharf
,
where
they
were
to
take
steam
-
boat
for
some
Reach
down
the
river
,
the
name
of
which
,
as
the
Captain
gave
it
out
,
was
a
hopeless
mystery
to
the
ears
of
landsmen
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
this
Reach
(
whither
the
ship
had
repaired
by
last
night
's
tide
)
,
they
were
boarded
by
various
excited
watermen
,
and
among
others
by
a
dirty
Cyclops
of
the
Captain
's
acquaintance
,
who
,
with
his
one
eye
,
had
made
the
Captain
out
some
mile
and
a
half
off
,
and
had
been
exchanging
unintelligible
roars
with
him
ever
since
.
<EOS>
Becoming
the
lawful
prize
of
this
personage
,
who
was
frightfully
hoarse
and
constitutionally
in
want
of
shaving
,
they
were
all
three
put
aboard
the
Son
and
Heir
.
<EOS>
And
the
Son
and
Heir
was
in
a
pretty
state
of
confusion
,
with
sails
lying
all
bedraggled
on
the
wet
decks
,
loose
ropes
tripping
people
up
,
men
in
red
shirts
running
barefoot
to
and
fro
,
casks
blockading
every
foot
of
space
,
and
,
in
the
thickest
of
the
fray
,
a
black
cook
in
a
black
caboose
up
to
his
eyes
in
vegetables
and
blinded
with
smoke
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
immediately
drew
Walter
into
a
corner
,
and
with
a
great
effort
,
that
made
his
face
very
red
,
pulled
up
the
silver
watch
,
which
was
so
big
,
and
so
tight
in
his
pocket
,
that
it
came
out
like
a
bung
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wal'r
said
the
Captain
,
handing
it
over
,
and
shaking
him
heartily
by
the
hand
,
"
a
parting
gift
,
my
lad
.
<EOS>
Put
it
back
half
an
hour
every
morning
,
and
about
another
quarter
towards
the
afternoon
,
and
it
's
a
watch
that
'll
do
you
credit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Cuttle
!
<EOS>
I
could
n't
think
of
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Walter
,
detaining
him
,
for
he
was
running
away
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pray
take
it
back
.
<EOS>
I
have
one
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Wal'r
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
suddenly
diving
into
one
of
his
pockets
and
bringing
up
the
two
teaspoons
and
the
sugar
-
tongs
,
with
which
he
had
armed
himself
to
meet
such
an
objection
,
"
take
this
here
trifle
of
plate
,
instead
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
no
,
I
could
n't
indeed
!
"
cried
Walter
,
"
a
thousand
thanks
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
throw
them
away
,
Captain
Cuttle
!
"
<EOS>
for
the
Captain
was
about
to
jerk
them
overboard
.
<EOS>
"
They
'll
be
of
much
more
use
to
you
than
me
.
<EOS>
Give
me
your
stick
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
thought
I
should
like
to
have
it
.
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
Captain
Cuttle
!
<EOS>
Take
care
of
my
uncle
!
<EOS>
Uncle
Sol
,
God
bless
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
over
the
side
in
the
confusion
,
before
Walter
caught
another
glimpse
of
either
;
and
when
he
ran
up
to
the
stern
,
and
looked
after
them
,
he
saw
his
uncle
hanging
down
his
head
in
the
boat
,
and
Captain
Cuttle
rapping
him
on
the
back
with
the
great
silver
watch
<EOS>
(
it
must
have
been
very
painful
)
,
and
gesticulating
hopefully
with
the
teaspoons
and
sugartongs
.
<EOS>
Catching
sight
of
Walter
,
Captain
Cuttle
dropped
the
property
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
with
perfect
unconcern
,
being
evidently
oblivious
of
its
existence
,
and
pulling
off
the
glazed
hat
hailed
him
lustily
.
<EOS>
The
glazed
hat
made
quite
a
show
in
the
sun
with
its
glistening
,
and
the
Captain
continued
to
wave
it
until
he
could
be
seen
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Then
the
confusion
on
board
,
which
had
been
rapidly
increasing
,
reached
its
height
;
two
or
three
other
boats
went
away
with
a
cheer
;
the
sails
shone
bright
and
full
above
,
as
Walter
watched
them
spread
their
surface
to
the
favourable
breeze
;
the
water
flew
in
sparkles
from
the
prow
;
and
off
upon
her
voyage
went
the
Son
and
Heir
,
as
hopefully
and
trippingly
as
many
another
son
and
heir
,
gone
down
,
had
started
on
his
way
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
Day
after
day
,
old
Sol
and
Captain
Cuttle
kept
her
reckoning
in
the
little
back
parlour
and
worked
out
her
course
,
with
the
chart
spread
before
them
on
the
round
table
.
<EOS>
At
night
,
when
old
Sol
climbed
upstairs
,
so
lonely
,
to
the
attic
where
it
sometimes
blew
great
guns
,
he
looked
up
at
the
stars
and
listened
to
the
wind
,
and
kept
a
longer
watch
than
would
have
fallen
to
his
lot
on
board
the
ship
.
<EOS>
The
last
bottle
of
the
old
Madeira
,
which
had
had
its
cruising
days
,
and
known
its
dangers
of
the
deep
,
lay
silently
beneath
its
dust
and
cobwebs
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
undisturbed
.

Mr
Dombey
goes
upon
a
Journey
 
<EOS>
"
MR
DOMBEY
,
Sir

"
said
Major
Bagstock
,
"
<EOS>
Joey
B
is
not
in
general
a
man
of
sentiment
,
for
Joseph
is
tough
.
<EOS>
But
Joe
has
his
feelings
,
Sir
,
and
when
they
are
awakened
---
Damme
,
Mr
Dombey
,
"
cried
the
Major
with
sudden
ferocity
,
"
this
is
weakness
,
and
I
wo
n't
submit
to
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Major
Bagstock
delivered
himself
of
these
expressions
on
receiving
Mr
Dombey
as
his
guest
at
the
head
of
his
own
staircase
in
Princess
's
Place
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
has
come
to
breakfast
with
the
Major
,
previous
to
their
setting
forth
on
their
trip
;
and
the
ill
-
starred
Native
had
already
undergone
a
world
of
misery
arising
out
of
the
muffins
,
while
,
in
connexion
with
the
general
question
of
boiled
eggs
,
life
was
a
burden
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
for
an
old
soldier
of
the
Bagstock
breed
,
"
observed
the
Major
,
relapsing
into
a
mild
state
,
"
to
deliver
himself
up
,
a
prey
to
his
own
emotions
;
but
---
damme
,
Sir
,
"
cried
the
Major
,
in
another
spasm
of
ferocity
,
"
I
condole
with
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
's
purple
visage
deepened
in
its
hue
,
and
the
Major
's
lobster
eyes
stood
out
in
bolder
relief
,
as
he
shook
Mr
Dombey
by
the
hand
,
imparting
to
that
peaceful
action
as
defiant
a
character
as
if
it
had
been
the
prelude
to
his
immediately
boxing
Mr
Dombey
for
a
thousand
pounds
a
side
and
the
championship
of
England
.
<EOS>
With
a
rotatory
motion
of
his
head
,
and
a
wheeze
very
like
the
cough
of
a
horse
,
the
Major
then
conducted
his
visitor
to
the
sitting
-
room
,
and
there
welcomed
him
(
having
now
composed
his
feelings
)
with
the
freedom
and
frankness
of
a
travelling
companion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dombey

"
said
the
Major
,
"
I
'm
glad
to
see
you

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
There
are
not
many
men

J
Bagstock
would
say
that

for
Josh
is
blunt

<EOS>
Sir

it
's
his
nature

but
Joey
B
is
proud
to

Major

returned
Mr

,
"
you

<EOS>
"
No

said
the

,
"
Devil

That

my

If

Joe

you
in
very
different
quarters
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
old
Joe
<EOS>
yet
,
I
find
.
<EOS>
But
this
occasion
,
being
special
,
is
a
source
of
pride
to
me
.
<EOS>
By
the
Lord
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Major
resolutely
,
"
it
's
an
honour
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
in
his
estimation
of
himself
and
his
money
,
felt
that
this
was
very
true
,
and
therefore
did
not
dispute
the
point
.
<EOS>
But
the
instinctive
recognition
of
such
a
truth
by
the
Major
,
and
his
plain
avowal
of
it
,
were
very
agreeable
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
confirmation
to
Mr
Dombey
,
if
he
has
required
any
,
of
his
not
being
mistaken
in
the
Major
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
assurance
to
him
that
his
power
extended
beyond
his
own
immediate
sphere
;
and
that
the
Major
,
as
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
,
had
a
no
less
becoming
sense
of
it
,
than
the
beadle
of
the
Royal
Exchange
.
  
<EOS>
And
if
it
were
ever
consolatory
to
know
this
,
or
the
like
of
this
,
it
was
consolatory
then
,
when
the
impotence
of
his
will
,
the
instability
of
his
hopes
,
the
feebleness
of
wealth
,
had
been
so
direfully
impressed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
What
could
it
do
,
his
boy
had
asked
him
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
thinking
of
the
baby
question
,
he
could
hardly
forbear
inquiring
,
himself
,
what
could
it
do
indeed
:
what
had
it
done
?
  
<EOS>
But
these
were
lonely
thoughts
,
bred
late
at
night
in
the
sullen
despondency
and
gloom
of
his
retirement
,
and
pride
easily
found
its
reassurance
in
many
testimonies
to
the
truth
,
as
unimpeachable
and
precious
as
the
Major
's
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
in
his
friendlessness
,
inclined
to
the
Major
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
said
that
he
warmed
towards
him
,
but
he
thawed
a
little
.
<EOS>
The
Major
had
had
some
part
---
and
not
too
much
---
in
the
days
by
the
seaside
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
of
the
world
,
and
knew
some
great
people
.
<EOS>
He
talked
much
,
and
told
stories
;
and
Mr
Dombey
was
disposed
to
regard
him
as
a
choice
spirit
who
shone
in
society
,
and
who
had
not
that
poisonous
ingredient
of
poverty
with
which
choice
spirits
in
general
are
too
much
adulterated
.
<EOS>
His
station
was
undeniable
.
<EOS>
Altogether
the
Major
was
a
creditable
companion
,
well
accustomed
to
a
life
of
leisure
,
and
to
such
places
as
that
they
were
about
to
visit
,
and
having
an
air
of
gentlemanly
ease
about
him
that
mixed
well
enough
with
his
own
City
character
,
and
did
not
compete
with
it
at
all
.
<EOS>
If
Mr
Dombey
had
any
lingering
idea
that
the
Major
,
as
a
man
accustomed
,
in
the
way
of
his
calling
,
to
make
light
of
the
ruthless
had
<EOS>
that
hand
lately
crushed
his
hopes
,
might
unconsciously
impart
some
useful
philosophy
to
him
,
and
scare
away
his
weak
regrets
,
he
hid
it
from
himself
,
and
left
it
lying
at
the
bottom
of
his
pride
,
unexamined
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
my
scoundrel
?
"
said
the
Major
,
looking
wrathfully
round
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
Native
,
who
had
no
particular
name
,
but
answered
to
any
vituperative
epithet
,
presented
himself
instantly
at
the
door
and
ventured
to
come
no
nearer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
villain
!
"
said
the
choleric
Major
,
"
where
's
the
breakfast
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
dark
servant
disappeared
in
search
of
it
,
and
was
quickly
heard
reascending
the
stairs
in
such
a
tremulous
state
,
that
the
plates
and
dishes
on
the
tray
he
carried
,
trembling
sympathetically
as
he
came
,
rattled
again
,
all
the
way
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dombey
,
"
said
the
Major
,
glancing
at
the
Native
as
he
arranged
the
table
,
and
encouraging
him
with
an
awful
shake
of
his
fist
when
he
upset
a
spoon
,
"
here
is
a
devilled
grill
,
a
savoury
pie
,
a
dish
of
kidneys
,
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
Pray
sit
down
.
<EOS>
Old
Joe
can
give
you
nothing
but
camp
fare
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
excellent
fare
,
Major
,
"
replied
his
guest
;
and
not
in
mere
politeness
either
;
for
the
Major
always
took
the
best
possible
care
of
himself
,
and
indeed
ate
rather
more
of
rich
meats
than
was
good
for
him
,
insomuch
that
his
Imperial
complexion
was
mainly
referred
by
the
faculty
to
that
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
looking
over
the
way
,
Sir
,
"
observed
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
our
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
Miss
Tox
,
"
retorted
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Charming
woman
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Major
,
with
a
fat
laugh
rising
in
his
short
throat
,
and
nearly
suffocating
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Tox
is
a
very
good
sort
of
person
,
I
believe
,
"
replied
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
The
haughty
coldness
of
the
reply
seemed
to
afford
Major
Bagstock
infinite
delight
.
<EOS>
He
swelled
and
swelled
,
exceedingly
:
and
even
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
for
a
moment
,
to
rub
his
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Old
Joe
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Major
,
"
was
a
bit
of
a
favourite
in
that
quarter
once
.
<EOS>
But
Joe
has
had
his
day
.
<EOS>
J
Bagstock
is
extinguished
---
outrivalled
---
floored
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
,
Dombey
.
"
<EOS>
The
Major
paused
in
his
eating
,
and
looked
mysteriously
indignant
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
de
-
vilish
ambitious
woman
,
Sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
said
"
Indeed
?
"
<EOS>
with
frigid
indifference
:
mingled
perhaps
with
some
contemptuous
incredulity
as
to
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
having
the
presumption
to
harbour
such
a
superior
quality
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
woman
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Major
,
"
is
,
in
her
way
,
a
Lucifer
.
<EOS>
Joey
B
has
had
his
day
,
Sir
,
but
he
keeps
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
sees
,
does
Joe
.
<EOS>
His
Royal
Highness
the
late
Duke
of
York
observed
of
Joey
,
at
a
levee
,
that
he
saw
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
accompanied
this
with
such
a
look
,
and
,
between
eating
,
drinking
,
hot
tea
,
devilled
grill
,
muffins
,
and
meaning
,
was
altogether
so
swollen
and
inflamed
about
the
head
,
that
even
Mr
Dombey
showed
some
anxiety
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
ridiculous
old
spectacle
,
Sir
,
"
pursued
the
Major
,
"
aspires
.
<EOS>
She
aspires
sky
-
high
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Matrimonially
,
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
her
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
that
,
Dombey
,
"
returned
the
Major
in
a
warning
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
not
,
Major
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
The
Major
gave
no
answer
but
the
horse
's
cough
,
and
went
on
eating
vigorously
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
taken
an
interest
in
your
household
,
"
said
the
Major
,
stopping
short
again
,
"
and
has
been
a
frequent
visitor
at
your
house
for
some
time
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Mr
Dombey
with
great
stateliness
,
"
Miss
Tox
was
originally
received
there
,
at
the
time
of
Mrs
Dombey
's
death
,
as
a
friend
of
my
sister
's
;
and
being
a
well
-
behaved
person
,
and
showing
a
liking
for
the
poor
infant
<EOS>
,
she
was
permitted
---
I
may
say
encouraged
---
to
repeat
her
visits
with
my
sister
,
and
gradually
to
occupy
a
kind
of
footing
of
familiarity
in
the
family
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
was
making
a
great
and
valuable
concession
,
"
I
have
a
respect
for
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
so
obliging
as
to
render
many
little
services
in
my
house
:
trifling
and
insignificant
services
perhaps
,
Major
,
but
not
to
be
disparaged
on
that
account
:
<EOS>
and
I
hope
I
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
enabled
to
acknowledge
them
by
such
attention
and
notice
as
it
has
been
in
my
power
to
bestow
.
<EOS>
I
hold
myself
indebted
to
Miss
Tox
,
Major
,
"
added
Mr
Dombey
,
with
a
slight
wave
of
his
hand
,
"
for
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dombey
,
"
said
the
Major
,
warmly
:
"
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
No
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
Joseph
Bagstock
can
never
permit
that
assertion
to
pass
uncontradicted
.
<EOS>
Your
knowledge
of
old
Joe
,
Sir
,
such
as
he
is
,
and
old
Joe
's
knowledge
of
you
,
Sir
,
had
its
origin
in
a
noble
fellow
,
Sir
---
in
a
great
creature
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Dombey
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
Major
,
with
a
struggle
which
it
was
not
very
difficult
to
parade
,
his
whole
life
being
a
struggle
against
all
kinds
of
apoplectic
symptoms
,
"
we
knew
each
other
through
your
boy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
seemed
touched
,
as
it
is
not
improbable
the
Major
designed
he
should
be
,
by
this
allusion
.
<EOS>
He
looked
down
and
sighed
:
and
<EOS>
the
Major
,
rousing
himself
fiercely
,
again
said
,
in
reference
to
the
state
of
mind
into
which
he
felt
himself
in
danger
of
falling
,
that
this
was
weakness
,
and
nothing
should
induce
him
to
submit
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
friend
has
a
remote
connexion
with
that
event
,
"
said
the
Major
,
"
and
all
the
credit
that
belongs
to
her
,
JB
is
willing
to
give
her
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
which
,
Ma'am
,
"
he
added
,
raising
his
eyes
from
his
plate
,
and
casting
them
across
Princess
's
Place
,
to
where
Miss
Tox
was
at
that
moment
visible
at
her
window
watering
her
flowers
,
"
you
're
a
scheming
jade
,
Ma'am
,
and
your
ambition
is
a
piece
of
monstrous
impudence
.
<EOS>
If
it
only
made
yourself
ridiculous
,
Ma'am
,
"
said
the
Major
,
rolling
his
head
at
the
unconscious
Miss
Tox
,
while
his
starting
eyes
appeared
to
make
a
leap
towards
her
,
"
you
might
do
that
to
your
heart
's
content
,
Ma'am
,
without
any
objection
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
on
the
part
of
Bagstock
.
<EOS>
"
Here
the
Major
laughed
frightfully
up
in
the
tips
of
his
ears
and
in
the
veins
of
his
head
.
"
<EOS>
But
when
,
Ma'am
,
"
said
the
Major
,
"
you
compromise
other
people
,
and
generous
,
unsuspicious
people
too
,
as
a
repayment
for
their
condescension
,
you
stir
the
blood
of
old
Joe
in
his
body
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Major
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
reddening
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
you
do
not
hint
at
anything
so
absurd
on
the
part
of
Miss
Tox
as
---
"
  
"
Dombey
,
"
returned
the
Major
,
"
<EOS>
I
hint
at
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
Joey
B
has
lived
in
the
world
,
Sir
:
lived
in
the
world
with
his
eyes
open
,
Sir
,
and
his
ears
cocked
:
and
Joe
tells
you
,
Dombey
,
that
there
's
a
de
-
vilish
artful
and
ambitious
woman
over
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
involuntarily
glanced
over
the
way
;
and
an
angry
glance
he
sent
in
that
direction
,
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
on
such
a
subject
that
shall
pass
the
lips
of
Joseph
Bagstock
,
"
said
the
Major
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
Joe
is
not
a
talebearer
,
but
there
are
times
when
he
must
speak
,
when
he
will
speak
!
<EOS>
---
confound
your
arts
,
Ma'am
,
"
cried
the
Major
,
again
apostrophising
his
fair
neighbour
,
with
great
ire
,
---
"
when
the
provocation
is
too
strong
to
admit
of
his
remaining
silent
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
emotion
of
this
outbreak
threw
the
Major
into
a
paroxysm
of
horse
's
coughs
,
which
held
him
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
On
recovering
he
added
:
  
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
Dombey
,
as
you
have
invited
Joe
---
old
Joe
,
who
has
no
other
merit
,
Sir
,
but
that
he
is
tough
and
hearty
---
to
be
your
guest
and
guide
at
Leamington
,
command
him
in
any
way
you
please
,
and
he
is
wholly
yours
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Major
,
wagging
his
double
chin
with
a
jocose
air
,
"
what
it
is
you
people
see
in
Joe
to
make
you
hold
him
in
such
great
request
,
all
of
you
;
but
this
I
know
,
Sir
,
that
if
he
was
n't
pretty
tough
,
and
obstinate
in
his
refusals
,
you
'd
kill
him
among
you
with
your
invitations
and
so
forth
,
in
double
-
quick
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
in
a
few
words
,
expressed
his
sense
of
the
preference
he
received
over
those
other
distinguished
members
of
society
who
were
clamouring
for
the
possession
of
Major
Bagstock
.
<EOS>
But
the
Major
cut
him
short
by
giving
him
to
understand
that
he
followed
his
own
inclinations
,
and
that
they
had
risen
up
in
a
body
and
said
with
one
accord
,
"
JB
,
Dombey
is
the
man
for
you
to
choose
as
a
friend
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
being
by
this
time
in
a
state
of
repletion
,
with
essence
of
savoury
pie
oozing
out
at
the
corners
of
his
eyes
,
and
devilled
grill
and
kidneys
tightening
his
cravat
:
and
the
time
moreover
approaching
for
the
departure
of
the
railway
train
to
Birmingham
,
by
which
they
were
to
leave
town
:
the
Native
got
him
into
his
great
-
coat
with
immense
difficulty
,
and
buttoned
him
up
until
his
face
looked
staring
and
gasping
,
over
the
top
of
that
garment
,
as
if
he
were
in
a
barrel
.
<EOS>
The
Native
then
handed
him
separately
,
and
with
a
decent
interval
between
each
supply
,
his
wash
-
leather
gloves
,
his
thick
stick
,
and
his
hat
;
which
latter
article
the
Major
wore
with
a
rakish
air
on
one
side
of
his
head
,
by
way
of
toning
down
his
remarkable
visage
.
<EOS>
The
Native
had
previously
packed
,
in
all
possible
and
impossible
parts
of
Mr
Dombey
's
chariot
,
which
was
in
waiting
,
an
unusual
quantity
of
carpet
-
bags
and
small
portmanteaus
,
no
less
apoplectic
in
appearance
than
the
Major
himself
:
and
having
filled
his
own
pockets
with
Seltzer
water
,
East
India
sherry
,
sandwiches
,
shawls
,
telescopes
,
maps
,
and
newspapers
,
any
or
all
of
which
light
baggage
the
Major
might
require
at
any
instant
of
the
journey
,
he
announced
that
everything
was
ready
.
<EOS>
To
complete
the
equipment
of
this
unfortunate
foreigner
(
currently
believed
to
be
a
prince
in
his
own
country
)
,
when
he
took
his
seat
in
the
rumble
by
the
side
of
Mr
Towlinson
,
a
pile
of
the
Major
's
cloaks
and
great
-
coats
was
hurled
upon
him
by
the
landlord
,
who
aimed
at
him
from
the
pavement
with
those
great
missiles
like
a
Titan
,
and
so
covered
him
up
,
that
he
proceeded
,
in
a
living
tomb
,
to
the
railroad
station
.
  
<EOS>
But
before
the
carriage
moved
away
,
and
while
the
Native
was
in
the
act
of
sepulture
,
Miss
Tox
appearing
at
her
window
,
waved
a
lily
-
white
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
received
this
parting
salutation
very
coldly
---
very
coldly
even
for
him
---
and
honouring
her
with
the
slightest
possible
inclination
of
his
head
,
leaned
back
in
the
carriage
with
a
very
discontented
look
.
<EOS>
His
marked
behaviour
seemed
to
afford
the
Major
(
who
was
all
politeness
in
his
recognition
of
Miss
Tox
)
unbounded
satisfaction
;
and
he
sat
for
a
long
time
afterwards
,
leering
,
and
choking
,
like
an
over
-
fed
Mephistopheles
.
  
<EOS>
During
the
bustle
of
preparation
at
the
railway
,
Mr
Dombey
and
the
major
walked
up
and
down
the
platform
side
by
side
;
the
former
taciturn
and
gloomy
,
and
the
latter
entertaining
him
,
or
entertaining
himself
,
with
a
variety
of
anecdotes
and
reminiscences
,
in
most
of
which
<EOS>
Joe
Bagstock
was
the
principal
performer
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
the
two
observed
that
in
the
course
of
these
walks
,
they
attracted
the
attention
of
a
working
man
who
was
standing
near
the
engine
,
and
who
touched
his
hat
every
time
they
passed
;
for
Mr
Dombey
habitually
looked
over
the
vulgar
herd
,
not
at
them
;
and
the
Major
was
looking
,
at
the
time
,
into
the
core
of
one
of
his
stories
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
this
man
stepped
before
them
as
they
turned
round
,
and
pulling
his
hat
off
,
and
keeping
it
off
,
ducked
his
head
to
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Beg
your
pardon
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
man
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
hope
you
're
a
doin'
pretty
well
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
a
canvass
suit
abundantly
besmeared
with
coal
-
dust
and
oil
,
and
cinders
in
his
whiskers
,
and
a
smell
of
half
-
slaked
ashes
all
over
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
bad
-
looking
fellow
,
nor
even
what
could
be
fairly
called
a
dirty
-
looking
fellow
,
in
spite
of
this
;
and
,
in
short
,
he
was
Mr
Toodle
,
professionally
clothed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
the
honour
of
stokin
'
of
you
down
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Toodle
.
<EOS>
"
Beg
your
pardon
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
find
yourself
a
coming
round
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
looked
at
him
,
in
return
for
his
tone
of
interest
,
as
if
a
man
like
that
would
make
his
very
eyesight
dirty
.
  
<EOS>
"
'
Scuse
the
liberty
,
Sir
,
"
said
Toodle
,
seeing
he
was
not
clearly
remembered
,
"
but
my
wife
Polly
,
as
was
called
Richards
in
your
family
---
"
  
A
change
in
Mr
Dombey
's
face
,
which
seemed
to
express
recollection
of
him
,
and
so
it
did
,
but
it
expressed
in
a
much
stronger
degree
and
angry
sense
of
humiliation
,
stopped
Mr
Toodle
short
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
wife
wants
money
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
speaking
(
but
that
he
always
did
)
haughtily
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
thank'ee
,
Sir
,
"
returned
Toodle
,
"
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
she
does
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
was
stopped
short
now
in
his
turn
:
and
awkwardly
:
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sir
,
"
said
Toodle
,
turning
his
oilskin
cap
round
and
round
;
"
we
're
a
doin'
pretty
well
,
Sir
;
we
have
n't
no
cause
to
complain
in
the
worldly
way
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
We
've
had
four
more
since
then
,
Sir
,
but
we
rubs
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
would
have
rubbed
on
to
his
own
carriage
,
though
in
so
doing
he
had
rubbed
the
stoker
underneath
the
wheels
;
but
his
attention
was
arrested
by
something
in
connexion
with
the
cap
still
going
slowly
round
and
round
in
the
man
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
lost
one
babby
,
"
observed
Toodle
,
"
there
's
no
denyin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lately
,
"
added
Mr
Dombey
,
looking
at
the
cap
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sir
,
up'ard
of
three
years
ago
,
but
all
the
rest
is
hearty
.
<EOS>
And
in
the
matter
o
'
readin
'
,
Sir
,
"
said
Toodle
,
ducking
again
,
as
if
to
remind
Mr
Dombey
of
what
had
passed
between
them
on
that
subject
long
ago
<EOS>
,
"
them
boys
o
'
mine
,
they
learned
me
,
among
'em
,
arter
all
.
<EOS>
They
've
made
a
wery
tolerable
scholar
of
me
,
Sir
,
them
boys
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
Major
!
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Beg
your
pardon
,
Sir
,
"
resumed
Toodle
,
taking
a
step
before
them
and
deferentially
stopping
them
again
,
still
cap
in
hand
:
"
I
would
n't
have
troubled
you
with
such
a
pint
except
as
a
way
of
gettin
'
in
the
name
of
my
son
Biler
---
christened
Robin
---
him
as
you
was
so
good
as
to
make
a
Charitable
Grinder
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
man
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
in
his
severest
manner
.
<EOS>
"
What
about
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Sir
,
"
returned
Toodle
,
shaking
his
head
with
a
face
of
great
anxiety
and
distress
,
"
I
'm
forced
to
say
,
Sir
,
that
he
's
gone
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
gone
wrong
,
has
he
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
with
a
hard
kind
of
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
fell
into
bad
company
,
you
see
,
gentlemen
,
"
pursued
the
father
,
looking
wistfully
at
both
,
and
evidently
taking
the
Major
into
the
conversation
with
the
hope
of
having
his
sympathy
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
got
into
bad
ways
.
<EOS>
God
send
he
may
come
to
again
,
gentlemen
,
but
he
's
on
the
wrong
track
now
!
<EOS>
You
could
hardly
be
off
hearing
of
it
somehow
,
Sir
,
"
said
Toodle
,
again
addressing
Mr
Dombey
individually
;
"
and
it
's
better
<EOS>
I
should
out
and
say
my
boy
's
gone
rather
wrong
.
<EOS>
Polly
's
dreadful
down
about
it
,
genelmen
,
"
said
Toodle
with
the
same
dejected
look
,
and
another
appeal
to
the
Major
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
son
of
this
man
's
whom
I
caused
to
be
educated
,
Major
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
giving
him
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
The
usual
return
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
advice
from
plain
old
Joe
,
and
never
educate
that
sort
of
people
,
Sir
,
"
returned
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
Damme
,
Sir
,
it
never
does
!
<EOS>
I
always
fails
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
simple
father
was
beginning
to
submit
that
he
hoped
his
son
,
the
quondam
Grinder
,
huffed
and
cuffed
,
and
flogged
and
badged
,
and
taught
,
as
parrots
are
,
by
a
brute
jobbed
into
his
place
of
schoolmaster
with
as
much
fitness
for
it
as
a
hound
,
might
not
have
been
educated
on
quite
a
right
plan
in
some
undiscovered
respect
,
when
Mr
Dombey
angrily
repeating
"
The
usual
return
!
"
led
the
Major
away
.
<EOS>
And
the
Major
being
heavy
to
hoist
into
Mr
Dombey
's
carriage
elevated
in
midair
,
and
having
to
stop
and
swear
that
he
would
flay
the
Native
alive
,
and
break
very
bone
in
his
skin
,
and
visit
other
physical
torments
upon
him
,
every
time
he
could
n't
get
his
foot
on
the
step
,
and
fell
back
on
that
dark
exile
,
had
barely
time
before
they
started
to
repeat
hoarsely
that
it
would
never
do
:
that
it
always
failed
:
and
that
if
he
were
to
educate
"
his
own
vagabond
,
"
he
would
certainly
be
hanged
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
assented
bitterly
;
but
there
was
something
more
in
his
bitterness
,
and
in
his
moody
way
of
falling
back
in
the
carriage
,
and
looking
with
knitted
brows
at
the
changing
objects
without
,
that
the
failure
of
that
noble
educational
system
administered
by
the
Grinders
'
Company
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
upon
the
man
's
rough
cap
a
piece
of
new
crape
,
and
he
had
assured
himself
,
from
his
manner
and
his
answers
,
that
he
wore
it
for
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
So
!
<EOS>
from
high
to
low
,
at
home
or
abroad
,
from
Florence
in
his
great
house
to
the
coarse
churl
who
was
feeding
the
fire
then
smoking
before
them
,
every
one
set
up
some
claim
or
other
to
a
share
in
his
dead
boy
,
and
was
a
bidder
against
him!Could
he
ever
forget
how
that
woman
had
wept
over
his
pillow
,
and
called
him
her
own
child
!
<EOS>
or
how
he
,
waking
from
his
sleep
,
had
asked
for
her
,
and
had
raised
himself
in
his
bed
and
brightened
when
she
came
in
!
  
<EOS>
To
think
of
this
presumptuous
raker
among
coals
and
ashes
going
on
before
there
,
with
his
sign
of
mourning
!
<EOS>
To
think
that
he
dared
to
enter
,
even
by
a
common
show
like
that
,
into
the
trial
and
disappointment
of
a
proud
gentleman
's
secret
heart
!
<EOS>
To
think
that
this
lost
child
,
who
was
to
have
divided
with
him
his
riches
,
and
his
projects
,
and
his
power
,
and
allied
with
whom
he
was
to
have
shut
out
all
the
world
as
with
a
double
door
of
gold
,
should
have
let
in
such
a
herd
to
insult
him
with
their
knowledge
of
his
defeated
hopes
,
and
their
boasts
of
claiming
community
of
feeling
with
himself
,
so
far
removed
:
if
not
of
having
crept
into
the
place
wherein
he
would
have
lorded
it
,
alone
!
  
<EOS>
He
found
no
pleasure
or
of
relief
in
the
journey
.
<EOS>
Tortured
by
these
thoughts
he
carried
monotony
with
him
,
through
the
rushing
landscape
,
and
hurried
headlong
,
not
through
a
rich
and
varied
country
,
but
a
wilderness
of
blighted
plans
and
gnawing
jealousies
.
<EOS>
The
very
speed
at
which
the
train
was
whirled
along
mocked
the
swift
course
of
the
young
life
that
had
been
borne
away
so
steadily
and
so
inexorably
to
its
foredoomed
end
.
<EOS>
The
power
that
forced
itself
upon
its
iron
way
---
its
own
---
defiant
of
all
paths
and
roads
,
piercing
through
the
heart
of
every
obstacle
,
and
dragging
living
creatures
of
all
classes
,
ages
,
and
degrees
behind
it
,
was
a
type
of
the
triumphant
monster
,
Death
.
  
<EOS>
Away
,
with
a
shriek
,
and
a
roar
,
and
a
rattle
,
from
the
town
,
burrowing
among
the
dwellings
of
men
and
making
the
streets
hum
,
flashing
out
into
the
meadows
for
a
moment

mining
in
through
the
damp
earth

booming
on
in
darkness

heavy

bursting

objects
close

and
almost
in

ever
flying
from
the
traveller

and
a
deceitful
distance
ever
moving
slowly
within
him
:
like
as
in
the
track
of
the
remorseless
monster
,
Death
!

Through

on

by

by

lies

smooths

it
at

away

with
a
shriek

and
a
rattle

and
no
trace
to
leave
behind
but
dust

like

track

Death

<EOS>
Breasting
the
wind

light

the

sunshine
,
away

and
still
away

it
rolls

fierce

smooth

massive

crossing

fall
like

an

Away

onward

:
glimpses

of
houses

rich

of

small

insignificant

are
left

they
do

but
such
glimpses

Death

Away
,
with
a
shriek
,
and
a

a
rattle
,
plunging
down
into
the
earth
again

and
working
on
in
such
a
storm

energy
and
perseverance
,
that
amidst
the
darkness

whirlwind
the
motion
seems
reversed

to
tend
furiously
backward

until
a
ray

light

its

flying
past
like
a
fierce

<EOS>
Away
once

into

through
the

with
a
shrill
yell
of
exultation

roaring

rattling

tearing
on

spurning
everything
with
its
dark
breath
,
sometimes
pausing
for
a
minute
where
a
crowd
of
faces
are
,
that
in
a
minute
more
are
not
;
sometimes
lapping
water
greedily
,
and
before
the
spout
at
which
it
drinks
has
ceased
to
drip
upon
the
ground
,
shrieking
,
roaring
,
rattling
through
the
purple
distance
!
  
<EOS>
Louder
and
louder
<EOS>
yet
,
it
shrieks
and
cries
as
it
comes
tearing
on
resistless
to
the
goal
:
and
now
its
way
,
still
like
the
way
of
Death
,
is
strewn
with
ashes
thickly
.
<EOS>
Everything
around
is
blackened
.
<EOS>
There
are
dark
pools
of
water
,
muddy
lanes
,
and
miserable
habitations
far
below
.
<EOS>
There
are
jagged
walls
and
falling
houses
close
at
hand
,
and
through
the
battered
roofs
and
broken
windows
,
wretched
rooms
are
seen
,
where
want
and
fever
hide
themselves
in
many
wretched
shapes
,
while
smoke
and
crowded
gables
,
and
distorted
chimneys
,
and
deformity
of
brick
and
mortar
penning
up
deformity
of
mind
and
body
,
choke
the
murky
distance
.
<EOS>
As
Mr
Dombey
looks
out
of
his
carriage
window
,
it
is
never
in
his
thoughts
that
the
monster
who
has
brought
him
there
has
let
the
light
of
day
in
on
these
things
:
not
made
or
caused
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
journey
's
fitting
end
,
and
might
have
been
the
end
of
everything
;
it
was
so
ruinous
and
dreary
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
pursuing
the
one
course
of
thought
,
he
had
the
one
relentless
monster
still
before
him
.
<EOS>
All
things
looked
black
,
and
cold
,
and
deadly
upon
him
,
and
he
on
them
.
<EOS>
He
found
a
likeness
to
his
misfortune
everywhere
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
remorseless
triumph
going
on
about
him
,
and
it
galled
and
stung
him
in
his
pride
and
jealousy
,
<EOS>
whatever
form
it
took
:
<EOS>
though
most
of
all
when
it
divided
with
him
the
love
and
memory
of
his
lost
boy
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
face
<EOS>
---
he
had
looked
upon
it
,
on
the
previous
night
,
and
it
on
him
with
eyes
that
read
his
soul
,
though
they
were
dim
with
tears
,
and
hidden
soon
behind
two
quivering
hands
---
that
often
had
attended
him
in
fancy
,
on
this
ride
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
it
,
with
the
expression
of
last
night
,
timidly
pleading
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
reproachful
,
but
there
was
something
of
doubt
,
almost
of
hopeful
incredulity
in
it
,
which
,
as
he
once
more
saw
that
fade
away
into
a
desolate
certainty
of
his
dislike
,
was
like
reproach
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
trouble
to
him
to
think
of
this
face
of
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
Because
he
felt
any
new
compunction
towards
it
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Because
the
feeling
it
awakened
in
him
---
of
which
he
had
had
some
old
foreshadowing
in
older
times
---
was
full
-
formed
now
,
and
spoke
out
plainly
,
moving
him
too
much
,
and
threatening
to
grow
too
strong
for
his
composure
.
<EOS>
Because
the
face
was
abroad
,
in
the
expression
of
defeat
and
persecution
that
seemed
to
encircle
him
like
the
air
.
<EOS>
Because
it
barbed
the
arrow
of
that
cruel
and
remorseless
enemy
on
which
his
thoughts
so
ran
,
and
put
into
its
grasp
a
double
-
handed
sword
.
<EOS>
Because
he
knew
full
well
,
in
his
own
breast
,
as
he
stood
there
,
tinging
the
scene
of
transition
before
him
with
the
morbid
colours
of
his
own
mind
,
and
making
it
a
ruin
and
a
picture
of
decay
,
instead
of
hopeful
change
,
and
promise
of
better
things
,
that
life
had
quite
as
much
to
do
with
his
complainings
as
death
.
<EOS>
One
child
was
gone
,
and
one
child
left
.
<EOS>
Why
was
the
object
of
his
hope
removed
instead
of
her
?
  
<EOS>
The
sweet
,
calm
,
gentle
presence
in
his
fancy
,
moved
him
to
no
reflection
but
that
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
unwelcome
to
him
from
the
first
;
she
was
an
aggravation
of
his
bitterness
now
.
<EOS>
If
his
son
had
been
his
only
child
,
and
the
same
blow
had
fallen
on
him
,
it
would
have
been
heavy
to
bear
;
but
infinitely
lighter
than
now
,
when
it
might
have
fallen
on
her
(
whom
he
could
have
lost
,
or
he
believed
it
,
without
a
pang
)
,
and
had
not
.
<EOS>
Her
loving
and
innocent
face
rising
before
him
,
and
had
no
softening
or
winning
influence
.
<EOS>
He
rejected
the
angel
,
and
took
up
with
the
tormenting
spirit
crouching
in
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
Her
patience
,
goodness
,
youth
,
devotion
,
love
,
were
as
so
many
atoms
in
the
ashes
upon
which
he
set
his
heel
.
<EOS>
He
saw
her
image
in
the
blight
and
blackness
all
around
him
,
not
irradiating
but
deepening
the
gloom
.
<EOS>
More
than
once
upon
this
journey
,
and
how
again
as
he
stood
pondering
at
this
journey
's
end
,
tracing
figures
in
the
dust
with
his
stick
,
the
thought
came
into
his
mind
,
<EOS>
what
was
there
he
could
interpose
between
himself
and
it
?
  
<EOS>
The
Major
,
who
had
been
blowing
and
panting
all
the
way
down
,
like
another
engine
,
and
whose
eye
had
often
wandered
from
his
newspaper
to
leer
at
the
prospect
,
as
if
there
were
a
procession
of
discomfited
Miss
Toxes
pouring
out
in
the
smoke
of
the
train
,
and
flying
away
over
the
fields
to
hide
themselves
in
any
place
of
refuge
,
aroused
his
friend
by
informing
him
that
the
post
-
horses
were
harnessed
and
the
carriage
ready
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dombey
,
"
said
the
Major
,
rapping
him
on
the
arm
with
his
cane
,
"
do
n't
be
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
bad
habit
.
<EOS>
Old
Joe
,
Sir
,
would
n't
be
as
tough
as
you
see
him
,
if
he
had
ever
encouraged
it
.
<EOS>
You
are
too
great
<EOS>
a
man
,
Dombey
,
to
be
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
In
your
position
,
Sir
,
you
're
far
above
that
kind
of
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
even
in
his
friendly
remonstrances
,
thus
consulting
the
dignity
and
honour
of
Mr
Dombey
,
and
showing
a
lively
sense
of
their
importance
,
Mr
Dombey
felt
more
than
ever
disposed
to
defer
to
a
gentleman
possessing
so
much
good
sense
and
such
a
well
-
regulated
mind
;
accordingly
he
made
an
effort
to
listen
to
the
Major
's
stories
,
as
they
trotted
along
the
turnpike
road
;
and
the
Major
,
finding
both
the
pace
and
the
road
a
great
deal
better
adapted
to
his
conversational
powers
than
the
mode
of
travelling
they
had
just
relinquished
,
came
out
for
his
entertainment
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
flow
of
spirits
and
conversation
,
only
interrupted
by
his
usual
plethoric
symptoms
,
and
by
intervals
of
lunch
,
and
from
time
to
time
by
some
violent
assault
upon
the
Native
,
who
wore
a
pair
of
ear
-
rings
in
his
dark
-
brown
ears
,
and
on
whom
his
European
clothes
sat
with
an
outlandish
impossibility
of
adjustment
---
being
,
of
their
own
accord
,
and
without
any
reference
to
the
tailor
's
art
,
long
where
they
ought
to
be
short
,
short
where
they
ought
to
be
long
,
tight
where
they
ought
to
be
loose
,
and
loose
where
they
ought
to
be
tight
---
and
to
which
he
imparted
a
new
grace
,
whenever
the
Major
attacked
him
,
by
shrinking
into
them
like
a
shrivelled
nut
,
or
a
cold
monkey
---
in
this
flow
of
spirits
and
conversation
,
the
Major
continued
all
day
:
so
that
when
evening
came
on
,
and
found
them
trotting
through
the
green
and
leafy
road
near
Leamington
,
the
Major
's
voice
,
what
with
talking
and
eating
and
chuckling
and
choking
,
appeared
to
be
in
the
box
under
the
rumble
,
or
in
some
neighbouring
hay
-
stack
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
the
Major
improve
it
at
the
Royal
Hotel
,
where
rooms
and
dinner
had
been
ordered
,
and
where
he
so
oppressed
his
organs
of
speech
by
eating
and
drinking
,
that
when
he
retired
to
bed
he
had
no
voice
at
all
,
except
to
cough
with
,
and
could
only
make
himself
intelligible
to
the
dark
servant
by
gasping
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
not
only
rose
next
morning
,
however
,
like
a
giant
refreshed
,
but
conducted
himself
,
at
breakfast
,
like
a
giant
refreshing
.
<EOS>
At
this
meal
they
arranged
their
daily
habits
.
<EOS>
The
Major
was
to
take
the
responsibility
or
ordering
everything
to
eat
and
drink
;
and
they
were
to
have
a
late
breakfast
together
every
morning
,
and
a
late
dinner
together
every
day
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
would
prefer
remaining
in
his
own
room
,
or
walking
in
the
country
by
himself
,
on
that
first
day
of
their
sojourn
at
Leamington
;
but
next
morning
he
would
be
happy
to
accompany
the
Major
to
the
Pump
-
room
,
and
about
the
town
.
<EOS>
So
they
parted
until
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
retired
to
nurse
his
wholesome
thoughts
in
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
The
Major
,
attended
by
the
Native
carrying
a
camp
-
stool
,
a
great
-
coast
,
and
an
umbrella
,
swaggered
up
and
down
through
all
the
public
places
:
looking
into
subscription
books
to
find
out
who
was
there
,
looking
up
old
ladies
by
whom
he
was
much
admired
,
reporting
JB
tougher
than
ever
,
and
puffing
his
rich
friend
Dombey
wherever
he
went
.
<EOS>
There
never
was
a
man
who
stood
by
a
friend
more
staunchly
than
the
Major
,
when
in
puffing
him
,
he
puffed
himself
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
surprising
how
much
new
conversation
the
Major
had
to
let
off
at
dinner
-
time
,
and
what
occasion
he
gave
Mr
Dombey
to
admire
his
social
qualities
.
<EOS>
At
breakfast
next
morning
,
he
knew
the
contents
of
the
latest
newspapers
received
;
and
mentioned
several
subjects
in
connexion
with
them
,
on
which
his
opinion
had
recently
been
sought
by
persons
of
such
power
and
might
,
that
they
were
only
to
be
obscurely
hinted
at
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
who
had
been
so
long
shut
up
within
himself
,
and
who
had
rarely
,
at
any
time
,
overstepped
the
enchanted
circle
within
which
the
operations
of
Dombey
and
Son
were
conducted
,
began
to
think
this
an
improvement
on
his
solitary
life
;
and
in
place
of
excusing
himself
for
another
day
,
as
he
had
thought
of
doing
when
alone
,
walked
out
with
the
Major
arm
-
in
-
arm
.

New
Faces
 
<EOS>
THE
Major
,
more
blue
-
faced
and
staring
---
more
over
-
ripe
,
as
it
were
,
than
ever
---
and
giving
vent
,
every
now
and
then
,
to
one
of
the
horse
's
coughs
,
not
so
much
of
necessity
as
in
a
spontaneous
explosion
of
importance
,
walked
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
Mr
Dombey
up
the
sunny
side
of
the
way
,
with
his
cheeks
swelling
over
his
tight
stock
,
his
legs
majestically
wide
apart
,
and
his
great
head
wagging
from
side
to
side
,
as
if
he
were
remonstrating
within
himself
for
being
such
a
captivating
object
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
walked
many
yards
,
before
the
Major
encountered
somebody
else
he
knew
,
nor
many
yards
farther
before
the
Major
encountered
somebody
else
he
knew
,
but
he
merely
shook
his
fingers
at
them
as
he
passed
,
and
led
Mr
Dombey
on
:
pointing
out
the
localities
as
they
went
,
and
enlivening
the
walk
with
any
current
scandal
suggested
by
them
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
manner
the
Major
and
Mr
Dombey
were
walking
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
much
to
their
own
satisfaction
,
when
they
beheld
advancing
towards
them
,
a
wheeled
chair
,
in
which
a
lady
was
seated
,
indolently
steering
her
carriage
by
a
kind
of
rudder
in
front
,
while
it
was
propelled
by
some
unseen
power
in
the
rear
.
<EOS>
Although
the
lady
was
not
young
,
she
was
very
blooming
in
the
face
---
quite
rosy
---
and
her
dress
and
attitude
were
perfectly
juvenile
.
<EOS>
Walking
by
the
side
of
the
chair
,
and
carrying
her
gossamer
parasol
with
a
proud
and
weary
air
,
as
if
so
great
an
effort
must
be
soon
abandoned
and
the
parasol
dropped
,
sauntered
a
much
younger
lady
,
very
handsome
,
<EOS>
very
haughty
,
very
wilful
,
who
tossed
her
head
and
drooped
her
eyelids
,
as
though
,
if
there
were
anything
in
all
the
world
worth
looking
into
,
save
a
mirror
,
it
certainly
was
not
the
earth
or
sky
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
the
devil
have
we
here
,
Sir
!
"
cried
the
Major
,
stopping
as
this
little
cavalcade
drew
near
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Edith
!
<EOS>
"
drawled
the
lady
in
the
chair
,
"
Major
Bagstock
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
Major
no
sooner
heard
the
voice
,
than
he
relinquished
Mr
Dombey
's
arm
,
darted
forward
,
took
the
hand
of
the
lady
in
the
chair
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
With
no
less
gallantry
,
the
Major
folded
both
his
gloves
upon
his
heart
,
and
bowed
low
to
the
other
lady
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
the
chair
having
stopped
,
the
motive
power
became
visible
in
the
shape
of
a
flushed
page
pushing
behind
,
who
seemed
to
have
in
part
outgrown
and
in
part
out
-
pushed
his
strength
,
for
when
he
stood
upright
<EOS>
he
was
tall
,
and
wan
,
and
thin
,
and
his
plight
appeared
the
more
forlorn
from
his
having
injured
the
shape
of
his
hat
,
by
butting
at
the
carriage
with
his
head
to
urge
it
forward
,
as
is
sometimes
done
by
elephants
in
Oriental
countries
.
  
<EOS>
"
Joe
Bagstock
,
"
said
the
Major
to
both
ladies
,
"
is
a
proud
and
happy
man
for
the
rest
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
false
creature
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
old
lady
in
the
chair
,
insipidly
.
<EOS>
"
Where
do
you
come
from
?
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
suffer
old
Joe
to
present
a
friend
,
Ma'am
,
"
said
the
Major
,
promptly
,
"
as
a
reason
for
being
tolerated
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
Mrs
Skewton
.
<EOS>
"
The
lady
in
the
chair
was
gracious
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
Mrs
Granger
.
<EOS>
"
The
lady
with
the
parasol
was
faintly
conscious
of
Mr
Dombey
's
taking
off
his
hat
,
and
bowing
low
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
delighted
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Major
,
"
to
have
this
opportunity
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
seemed
in
earnest
,
for
he
looked
at
all
the
three
,
and
leered
in
his
ugliest
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Skewton
,
Dombey
,
"
said
the
Major
,
"
makes
havoc
in
the
heart
of
old
Josh
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
signified
that
he
did
n't
wonder
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
perfidious
goblin
,
"
said
the
lady
in
the
chair
,
"
have
done
!
<EOS>
How
long
have
you
been
here
,
bad
man
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
day
,
"
replied
the
Major
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
can
you
be
a
day
,
or
even
a
minute
,
"
returned
the
lady
,
slightly
settling
her
false
curls
and
false
eyebrows
with
her
fan
,
and
showing
her
false
teeth
,
set
off
by
her
false
complexion
,
"
in
the
garden
of
what's
-
its
-
name
---
"
  
"
Eden
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
Mama
,
"
interrupted
the
younger
lady
,
scornfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Edith
,
"
said
the
other
,
"
I
can
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
can
remember
those
frightful
names
---
without
having
your
whole
Soul
and
Being
inspired
by
the
sight
of
Nature
;
by
the
perfume
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
rustling
a
handkerchief
that
was
faint
and
sickly
with
essences
,
"
of
her
artless
breath
,
you
creature
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
discrepancy
between
Mrs
Skewton
's
fresh
enthusiasm
of
words
,
and
forlornly
faded
manner
,
was
hardly
less
observable
than
that
between
her
age
,
which
was
about
seventy
,
and
her
dress
,
which
would
have
been
youthful
for
twenty
-
seven
.
<EOS>
Her
attitude
in
the
wheeled
chair
(
which
she
never
varied
)
was
one
in
which
she
had
been
taken
in
a
barouche
,
some
fifty
years
before
,
by
a
then
fashionable
artist
who
had
appended
to
his
published
sketch
the
name
of
Cleopatra
:
in
consequence
of
a
discovery
made
by
the
critics
of
the
time
,
that
it
bore
an
exact
resemblance
to
that
Princess
as
she
reclined
on
board
her
galley
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
was
a
beauty
then
,
and
bucks
threw
wine
-
glasses
over
their
heads
by
dozens
in
her
honor
.
<EOS>
The
beauty
and
the
barouche
had
both
passed
away
,
but
she
still
preserved
the
attitude
,
and
for
this
reason
expressly
,
maintained
the
wheeled
chair
and
the
butting
page
:
there
being
nothing
whatever
,
except
the
attitude
,
to
prevent
her
from
walking
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dombey
is
devoted
to
Nature
,
I
trust
?
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
settling
her
diamond
brooch
.
<EOS>
And
by
the
way
,
she
chiefly
lived
upon
the
reputation
of
some
diamonds
,
and
her
family
connexions
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
friend
Dombey
,
Ma'am
,
"
returned
the
Major
,
"
may
be
devoted
to
her
in
secret
,
but
a
man
who
is
paramount
in
the
greatest
city
in
the
universe
---
"
  
"
No
one
can
be
a
stranger
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
to
Mr
Dombey
's
immense
influence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
Mr
Dombey
acknowledged
the
compliment
with
a
bend
of
his
head
,
the
younger
lady
glancing
at
him
,
met
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
reside
here
,
Madam
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
addressing
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
we
have
been
to
a
great
many
places
.
<EOS>
To
Irrigate
and
Scarborough
,
and
into
Devonshire

<EOS>
We

been

<EOS>
Mama

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Edith
of
course

"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
with
a
ghastly
archness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
found
that
there
is
any
change
in
such
places
,
"
was
the
answer
,
delivered
with
supreme
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
libel
me
.
<EOS>
There
is
only
one
change
,
Mr
Dombey
,
"
observed
Mrs
Skewton
,
with
a
mincing
sigh
,
"
for
which
I
really
care
,
and
that
I
fear
I
shall
never
be
permitted
to
enjoy

<EOS>
People

not
spare
one
.
<EOS>
But
seclusion
and
contemplation
are
my
what

<EOS>
his

name
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
If
you
mean
Paradise
,
Mama
,
you
had
better
say
so
,
to
render
yourself
intelligible
,
"
said
the
younger
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Edith
,
"
returned
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
<EOS>
you
know
that
I
am
wholly
dependent
upon
you
for
those
odious
names
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
Mr
Dombey
,
Nature
intended
me
for
an
Arcadian
.
<EOS>
I
am
thrown
away
in
society
.
<EOS>
Cows
are
my
passion
.
<EOS>
What
I
have
ever
sighed
for
,
has
been
to
retreat
to
a
Swiss
farm
,
and
live
entirely
surrounded
by
cows
---
and
china
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
curious
association
of
objects
,
suggesting
a
remembrance
of
the
celebrated
bull
who
got
by
mistake
into
a
crockery
shop
,
was
received
with
perfect
gravity
by
Mr
Dombey
,
who
intimated
his
opinion
that
Nature
was
,
no
doubt
,
a
very
respectable
institution
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
want
,
"
drawled
Mrs
Skewton
,
pinching
her
shrivelled
throat
,
"
is
heart
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
frightfully
true
in
one
sense
,
if
not
in
that
in
which
she
used
the
phrase
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
want
,
is
frankness
,
confidence
,
less
conventionality
,
and
freer
play
of
soul

<EOS>
We
are
so
dreadfully
artificial
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
were
,
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
I
want
Nature
everywhere
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
so
extremely
charming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nature
is
inviting
us
away
now
,
Mama

"
said
the
younger
lady
,
curling
her
handsome
lip
.
<EOS>
At
this
hint
,
the
wan
page
,
who
had
been
surveying
the
party
over
the
top
of
the
chair
,
vanished
behind
it
,
as
if
the
ground
had
swallowed
him
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
moment
,
Withers
!
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
as
the
chair
began
to
move
;
calling
to
the
page
with
all
the
languid
dignity
with
which
she
had
called
in
days
of
yore
to
a
coachman
with
a
wig
,
cauliflower
nosegay
,
and
silk
stockings
.
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
staying
,
abomination
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
was
staying
at
the
Royal
Hotel
,
with
his
friend
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
come
and
see
us
any
evening
when
you
are
good
,
"
lisped
Mrs
Skewton
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
Mr
Dombey
will
honour
us
,
we
shall
be
happy
.
<EOS>
Withers
,
go
on
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
again
pressed
to
his
blue
lips
the
tips
of
the
fingers
that
were
disposed
on
the
ledge
of
the
wheeled
chair
with
careful
carelessness
,
after
the
Cleopatra
model
:
and
Mr
Dombey
bowed
.
<EOS>
The
elder
lady
honoured
them
both
with
a
very
gracious
smile
and
a
girlish
wave
of
her
hand
;
the
younger
lady
with
the
very
slightest
inclination
of
her
head
that
common
courtesy
allowed
.
  
<EOS>
The
last
glimpse
of
the
wrinkled
face
of
the
mother
,
with
that
patched
colour
on
it
which
the
sun
made
infinitely
more
haggard
and
dismal
than
any
want
of
colour
could
have
been
,
and
of
the
proud
beauty
of
the
daughter
with
her
graceful
figure
and
erect
deportment
,
engendered
such
an
involuntary
disposition
on
the
part
of
both
the
Major
and
Mr
Dombey
to
look
after
them
,
that
they
both
turned
at
the
same
moment
.
<EOS>
The
Page
,
nearly
as
much
aslant
as
his
own
shadow
,
was
toiling
after
the
chair
,
uphill
,
like
a
slow
battering
-
ram
;
<EOS>
the
top
of
Cleopatra
's
bonnet
was
fluttering
in
exactly
the
same
corner
to
the
inch
as
before
;
and
the
Beauty
,
loitering
by
herself
a
little
in
advance
,
expressed
in
all
her
elegant
form
,
from
head
to
foot
,
the
same
supreme
disregard
of
everything
and
everybody
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
<EOS>
what

"
said
the
Major
,
as
they
resumed
their
walk
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If

Mr

<EOS>
"
Genteel

said
the
Major
,
stopping
short
,

staring
in
his
companion
's
face

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The

<EOS>
The
Major
gave
a
flourish
with
his
stick
and
walked
on
again
,
in
despair
of
being
able
to
say
what
you
came
to
,
if
you
came
to
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

Mr

short
pause

"
Edith

returned
the

stopping
short
again
,

punching
a
mark
in
the
ground
with
his
cane
,
to
represent
her

married
(
at
eighteen

<EOS>
Granger

whom
the

indicated

another
punch

"

the

,
tapping
the

rolling
his

The

ran
the
representative
of

through
and
through
the
body
with
his
walking

stick
,

went
on
again

carrying
his

over
his
shoulder

asked
Mr

making
another
halt

shutting

putting

passing
his

into

smoothing

shouldering

the

<EOS>
"
There

Mr

sought

came
over

Mr

raising
his

"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
heaved
his
shoulders
,
and
his
cheeks
,
and
laughed
more
like
an
over
-
fed
Mephistopheles
than
ever
,
as
he
said
the
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Provided
the

made

said
Mr
Dombey
coldly
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
Gad

said
the
Major
,
"
the
Bagstock
breed
are
not
accustomed

obstacle

<EOS>
Though
it
's
true
enough
that
Edith
might
have
married
twin
-
ty
times
,
but
for
being
proud

Sir

Proud

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
seemed
,
by
his
face
,
to
think
no
worse
of
her
for
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
great
quality
after
all

"
said
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
By

it

quality

<EOS>
Dombey

<EOS>
You

proud
yourself

your
friend

Old
Joe

respects
you
for
it

Sir

"
  
<EOS>
With
this
tribute
to
the
character
of
his
ally
,
which
seemed
to
be
wrung
from
him
by
the
force
of
circumstances
and
the
irresistible
tendency
of
their
conversation
,
the
Major
closed
the
subject
,
and
glided
into
a
general
exposition
of
the
extent
to
which
he
had
been
beloved
and
doated
on
by
splendid
women
and
brilliant
creatures
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
day
<EOS>
but
one
,
Mr
Dombey
and
the
Major
encountered
the
Honourable
Mrs
Skewton
and
her
daughter
in
the
Pump
-
room
;
on
the
day
after
,
they
met
them
again
very
near
the
place
where
they
had
met
them
first
.
<EOS>
After
meeting
them
thus
,
three
or
four
times
in
all
,
it
became
a
point
of
mere
civility
to
old
acquaintances
that
the
Major
should
go
there
one
evening
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
had
to
originally
intended
to
pay
visits
,
but
on
the
Major
announcing
this
intention
,
he
said
he
would
have
the
pleasure
of
accompanying
him
.
<EOS>
So
the
Major
told
the
Native
to
go
round
before
dinner
,
and
say
,
with
his
and
Mr
Dombey
's
compliments
,
that
they
would
have
the
honour
of
visiting
the
ladies
that
same
evening
,
if
the
ladies
were
alone
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
which
message
,
the
Native
brought
back
a
very
small
note
with
a
very
large
quantity
of
scent
about
it
,
indited
by
the
Honourable
Mrs
Skewton
to
Major
Bagstock
,
and
briefly
saying
,
"
You
are
a
shocking
bear
,
and
I
have
a
great
mind
not
to

The
Honourable
Mrs
Skewton
and
her
daughter
,
Mrs
Granger
,
resided
,
while
at
Leamington
,
in
lodgings
that
were
fashionable
enough
and
dear
enough
,
but
rather
limited
in
point
of
space
and
conveniences
;
so
that
the
Honourable
Mrs
Skewton
,
being
in
bed
,
had
her
feet
in
the
window
and
her
head
in
the
fireplace
,
while
the
Honourable
Mrs
Skewton
's
maid
was
quartered
in
a
closet
within
the
drawing
-
room
,
so
extremely
small
,
that
,
to
avoid
developing
the
whole
of
its
accommodations
,
she
was
obliged
to
writhe
in
and
out
of
the
door
like
a
beautiful
serpent
.
<EOS>
Withers
,
the
wan
page
,
slept
out
of
the
house
immediately
under
the
tiles
at
a
neighbouring
milk
-
shop
;
and
the
wheeled
chair
,
which
was
the
stone
of
that
young
Sisyphus
,
passed
the
night
in
a
shed
belonging
to
the
same
dairy
,
where
new
-
laid
eggs
were
produced
by
the
poultry
connected
with
the
establishment
,
who
roosted
on
a
broken
donkey
-
cart
,
persuaded
,
to
all
appearance
,
that
it
grew
there
,
and
was
a
species
of
tree
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
and
the
Major
found
Mrs
Skewton
arranged
,
as
Cleopatra
,
among
the
cushions
of
a
sofa
:
very
airily
dressed
;
and
certainly
not
resembling
Shakspeare
's
Cleopatra
,
whom
age
could
not
wither
.
<EOS>
On
their
way
up
stairs
they
had
heard
the
sound
of
a
harp
,
but
it
had
ceased
on
their
being
announced
,
and
Edith
now
stood
beside
it
handsomer
and
haughtier
than
ever
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
remarkable
characteristic
of
this
lady
's
beauty
that
it
appeared
to
vaunt
and
assert
itself
without
her
aid
,
and
against
her
will
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
was
beautiful
:
it
was
impossible
that
it
could
be
otherwise
:
but
she
seemed
with
her
own
pride
to
defy
her
very
self
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
she
held
cheap
,
attractions
that
could
only
call
forth
admiration
that
was
worthless
to
her
,
or
whether
she
designed
to
render
them
more
precious
to
admirers
by
this
usage
of
them
,
those
to
whom
they
were
precious
seldom
paused
to
consider
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Mrs
Granger
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
advancing
a
step
towards
her
,
"
we
are
not
the
cause
of
<EOS>
your
ceasing
to
play
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
You
?
<EOS>
oh
no
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
not
go
on
then
,
my
dearest
Edith
?
"
said
Cleopatra
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
left
off
as
I
began
---
of
my
own
fancy
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
exquisite
indifference
of
her
manner
in
saying
this
:
an
indifference
quite
removed
from
dulness
or
insensibility
,
for
it
was
pointed
with
proud
purpose
:
was
well
set
off
by
the
carelessness
with
which
she
drew
her
hand
across
the
strings
,
and
came
from
that
part
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
Mr
Dombey
,
"
said
her
languishing
mother
,
playing
with
a
hand
-
screen
,
"
that
occasionally
my
dearest
Edith
and
myself
actually
almost
differ
---
"
  
"
Not
quite
,
sometimes
,
Mama
?
"
<EOS>
said
Edith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
never
quite
,
my
darling
!
<EOS>
Fie
,
fie
,
it
would
break
my
heart
,
"
returned
her
mother
,
making
a
faint
attempt
to
pat
her
with
the
screen
,
which
Edith
made
no
movement
to
meet
,
"
---
about
these
cold
conventionalities
of
manner
that
are
observed
in
little
things
?
<EOS>
Why
are
we
not
more
natural
?
<EOS>
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
With
all
those
yearnings
,
and
gushings
,
and
impulsive
throbbings
that
we
have
implanted
in
our
souls
,
and
which
are
so
very
charming
<EOS>
,
why
are
we
not
more
natural
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
said
it
was
very
true
,
very
true
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
could
be
more
natural
<EOS>
I
suppose
if
we
tried
?
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
thought
it
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
Devil
a
bit
,
Ma'am
,
"
said
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
We
could
n't
afford
it
.
<EOS>
Unless
the
world
was
peopled
with
JB

tough
and
blunt
old
Joes
,
Ma'am
,
plain
red
herrings
with
hard
roes
,
Sir
---
we
could
n't
afford
it
.
<EOS>
It
would
n't
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
naughty
Infidel
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
be
mute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cleopatra
commands
,
"
returned
the
Major
,
kissing
his
hand
,
"
and
Antony
Bagstock
obeys
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
man
has
no
sensitiveness
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
cruelly
holding
up
the
hand
-
screen
so
as
to
shut
the
Major
out
.
"
<EOS>
No
sympathy
.
<EOS>
And
what
do
we
live
for
but
sympathy
!
<EOS>
What
else
is
so
extremely
charming
!
<EOS>
Without
that
gleam
of
sunshine
on
our
cold
cold
earth
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
arranging
her
lace
tucker
,
and
complacently
observing
the
effect
of
her
bare
lean
arm
,
looking
upward
from
the
wrist
,
"
how
could
we
possibly
bear
it
?
<EOS>
In
short
,
obdurate
man
!
"
<EOS>
glancing
at
the
Major
,
round
the
screen
,
"
I
would
have
my
world
all
heart
;
and
Faith
is
so
excessively
charming
,
that
I
wo
n't
allow
you
to
disturb
it
,
do
you
hear
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
replied
that
it
was
hard
in
Cleopatra
to
require
the
world
to
be
all
heart
,
and
yet
to
appropriate
to
herself
the
hearts
of
all
the
world
;
which
obliged
Cleopatra
to
remind
him
that
flattery
was
insupportable
to
her
,
and
that
if
he
had
the
boldness
to
address
her
in
that
strain
any
more
,
she
would
positively
send
him
home
.

Withers

,
at
this
period
,
handing
round
the
tea

Mr
Dombey
again
addressed
himself
to
Edith
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
not
much
company
here
,
it
would
seem
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
in
his
own
portentous
gentlemanly
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
not
.
<EOS>
We
see
none
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
really
,
"
observed
Mrs
Skewton
from
her
couch
,
"
there
are
no
people
here
just
now
with
whom
we
care
to
associate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
not
enough
heart
,
"
said
Edith
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
The
very
twilight
of
a
smile
:
so
singularly
were
its
light
and
darkness
blended
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Edith
rallies
me
<EOS>
,
you
see
!
"
said
her
mother
,
shaking
her
head
:
which
shook
a
little
of
itself
sometimes
,
as
if
the
palsy
twinkled
now
and
then
in
opposition
to
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
Wicked
one
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
here
before
,
if
I
am
not
mistaken
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
Still
to
Edith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
several
times
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
have
been
everywhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
beautiful
country

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
is

Everybody
says
so

"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
cousin
Feenix
raves
about
it
,
Edith
,
"
interposed
her
mother
from
her
couch
.
  
<EOS>
The
daughter
slightly
turned
her
graceful
head
,
and
raising
her
eyebrows
by
a
hair's
-
breadth
,
as
if
her
cousin
Feenix
were
of
all
the
mortal
world
the
least
to
be
regarded
,
turned
her
eyes
again
towards
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
for
the
credit
of
my
good
taste
,
that
I
am
tired
of
the
neighbourhood
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
almost
reason
to
be
,
Madam
,
"
he
replied
,
glancing
at
a
variety
of
landscape
drawings
,
of
which
he
had
already
recognised
several
as
representing
neighbouring
points
of
view
,
and
which
were
strewn
abundantly
about
the
room
,
"
if
these
beautiful
productions
are
from
your
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
gave
him
no
reply
,
but
sat
in
a
disdainful
beauty
,
quite
amazing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
they
that
interest
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
Are
they
yours
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
play
,
I
already
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
sing
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
answered
all
these
questions
with
a
strange
reluctance
;
and
with
that
remarkable
air
of
opposition
to
herself
,
already
noticed
as
belonging
to
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
was
not
embarrassed
,
but
wholly
self
-
possessed
.
<EOS>
Neither
did
she
seem
to
wish
to
avoid
the
conversation
,
for
she
addressed
her
face
,
and
---
so
far
as
she
could
---
her
manner
also
,
to
him
;
and
continued
to
do
so
,
when
he
was
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
many
resources
against
weariness
at
least
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whatever
their
efficiency
may
be
,
"
she
returned
,
"
you
know
them
all
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
hope
to
prove
them
all
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
with
solemn
gallantry
,
laying
down
a
drawing
he
had
held
,
and
motioning
towards
the
harp
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
certainly
!
<EOS>
If
you
desire
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
rose
as
she
spoke
,
and
crossing
by
her
mother
's
couch
,
and
directing
a
stately
look
towards
her
,
which
was
instantaneous
in
its
duration
,
but
inclusive
(
if
any
one
had
seen
it
)
of
a
multitude
of
expressions
,
among
which
that
of
the
twilight
smile
,
without
the
smile
itself
,
overshadowed
all
the
rest
,
went
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
major
,
who
was
quite
forgiven
by
this
time
,
had
wheeled
a
little
table
up
to
Cleopatra
,
and
was
sitting
down
to
play
picquet
with
her
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
not
knowing
the
game
,
sat
down
to
watch
them
for
his
edification
until
Edith
should
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
going
to
have
some
music
,
Mr
Dombey
,
I
hope
?
"
said
Cleopatra
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Granger
has
been
kind
enough
to
promise
so
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
That
's
very
nice

<EOS>
Do
you
propose
,

"
  
<EOS>
"
No

said
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
Could

do
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
a

"
replied
the
lady
,
"
and
my
hand
's
destroyed

<EOS>
You
are
fond
of
music
,
Mr
Dombey

<EOS>
"
  
"
Eminently
so
,
"
was
Mr
Dombey
's
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
It
's
very
nice
,
"
said
Cleopatra
,
looking
at
her
cards
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
much
heart
in
it
---
undeveloped
recollections
of
a
previous
state
of
existence
---
and
all
that
---
which
is
so
truly
charming
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
"
simpered
Cleopatra
,
reversing
the
knave
of
clubs
,
who
had
come
into
her
game
with
his
heels
uppermost
,
"
that
if
anything
could
tempt
me
to
put
a
period
to
my
life
,
it
would
be
curiosity
to
find
out
what
it
's
all
about
,
and
what
it
means
;
there
are
so
many
provoking
mysteries
,
really
,
that
are
hidden
from
us
.
<EOS>
Major
,
you
to
play
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
played
;
and
Mr
Dombey
,
looking
on
for
his
instruction
,
would
soon
have
been
in
a
state
of
dire
confusion
,
but
that
he
gave
no
attention
to
the
game
whatever
,
and
sat
wondering
instead
when
Edith
would
come
back
.
  
<EOS>
She
came
at
last
,
and
sat
down
to
her
harp
,
and
Mr
Dombey
rose
and
stood
beside
her
,
listening
.
<EOS>
He
had
little
taste
for
music
,
and
no
knowledge
of
the
strain
she
played
,
but
he
saw
her
bending
over
it
,
and
perhaps
he
heard
among
the
sounding
strings
some
distant
music
of
his
own
,
that
tamed
the
monster
of
the
iron
road
,
and
made
it
less
inexorable
.
  
<EOS>
Cleopatra
had
a
sharp
eye
,
verily
,
at
picquet
.
<EOS>
It
glistened
like
a
bird
's
,
and
did
not
fix
itself
upon
the
game
,
but
pierced
the
room
from
end
to
end
,
and
gleamed
on
harp
,
performer
,
listener
,
everything
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
haughty
beauty
had
concluded
,
she
arose
,
and
receiving
Mr
Dombey
's
thanks
and
compliments
in
exactly
the
same
manner
as
before
,
went
with
scarcely
any
pause
to
the
piano
,
and
began
there
.
  
<EOS>
Edith
Granger
,
any
song
but
that
!
<EOS>
Edith
Granger
,
you
are
very
handsome
,
and
your
touch
upon
the
keys
is
brilliant
,
and
your
voice
is
deep
and
rich
;
but
not
the
air
that
his
neglected
daughter
sang
to
his
dead
son
!
  
<EOS>
Alas
,
he
knows
it
not
;
and
if
he
did
,
what
air
of
hers
would
stir
him
,
rigid
man
!
<EOS>
Sleep
lonely
Florence

sleep

Peace
in
thy
dreams

although
the
night
has
turned
dark

gathering

threaten
to
discharge
themselves

A
Trifle
of
Management
by
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
 
<EOS>
MR
CARKER
<EOS>
the
Manager
sat
at
his
desk
,
smooth
and
soft
as
usual
,
reading
those
letters
which
were
reserved
for
him
to
open
,
backing
them
occasionally
with
such
memoranda
and
references
as
their
business
purport
required
,
and
parcelling
them
out
into
little
heaps
for
distribution
through
the
several
departments
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
The
post
had
come
in
heavy
that
morning
,
and
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
had
a
good
deal
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
The
general
action
of
a
man
so
engaged
---
pausing
to
look
over
a
bundle
of
papers
in
his
hand
,
dealing
them
round
in
various
portions
,
taking
up
another
bundle
and
examining
its
contents
with
knitted
brows
and
pursed
-
out
lips
---
dealing
,
and
sorting
,
and
pondering
by
turns
---
would
easily
suggest
some
whimsical
resemblance
to
a
player
at
cards
.
<EOS>
The
face
of
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
was
in
good
keeping
with
such
a
fancy
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
face
of
a
man
who
studied
his
play
,
warily
:
who
made
himself
master
of
all
the
strong
and
weak
points
of
the
game
:
who
registered
the
cards
in
his
mind
as
they
fell
about
him
,
knew
exactly
what
was
on
them
,
what
they
missed
,
and
what
they
made
:
who
was
crafty
to
find
out
what
the
other
players
held
,
and
who
never
betrayed
his
own
hand
.
  
<EOS>
The
letters
were
in
various
languages
,
but
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
read
them
all
.
<EOS>
If
there
had
been
anything
in
the
offices
of
Dombey
and
Son
that
he
could
not
read
,
there
would
have
been
a
card
wanting
in
the
pack
.
<EOS>
He
read
almost
at
a
glance
,
and
made
combinations
of
one
letter
with
another
and
one
business
with
another
as
he
went
on
,
adding
new
matter
to
the
heaps
---
much
as
a
man
would
know
the
cards
at
sight
,
and
work
out
their
combinations
in
his
mind
after
they
were
turned
.
<EOS>
Something
too
deep
for
a
partner
,
and
much
too
deep
for
an
adversary
,
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
sat
in
the
rays
of
the
sun
that
came
down
slanting
on
him
through
the
skylight
,
playing
his
game
alone
.
  
<EOS>
And
although
it
is
not
among
the
instincts
wild
or
domestic
of
the
cat
tribe
to
play
at
cards
,
feline
from
sole
to
crown
was
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
,
as
he
basked
in
the
strip
of
summer
-
light
and
warmth
that
shone
upon
his
table
and
the
ground
as
if
they
were
a
crooked
dial
-
plate
,
and
himself
the
only
figure
on
it
.
<EOS>
With
hair
and
whiskers
deficient
in
colour
at
all
times
,
but
feebler
than
common
in
the
rich
sunshine
,
and
more
like
the
coat
of
a
sandy
tortoise
-
shell
cat
;
with
long
nails
,
nicely
pared
and
sharpened
;
with
a
natural
antipathy
to
any
speck
of
dirt
,
which
made
him
pause
sometimes
and
watch
the
falling
motes
of
dust
,
and
rub
them
off
his
smooth
white
hand
or
glossy
linen
:
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
,
sly
of
manner
,
sharp
of
tooth
,
soft
of
foot
,
watchful
of
eye
,
oily
of
tongue
,
cruel
of
heart
,
nice
of
habit
,
sat
with
a
dainty
steadfastness
and
patience
at
his
work
,
as
if
he
were
waiting
at
a
mouse
's
hole
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
the
letter
were
disposed
of
,
excepting
one
which
he
reserved
for
a
particular
audience
.
<EOS>
Having
locked
the
more
confidential
correspondence
in
a
drawer
,
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
rang
his
bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
youanswer
it
?
<EOS>
"
was
his
reception
of
his
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
messenger
is
out
,
and
I
am
the
next
,
"
was
the
submissive
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
next
?
"
<EOS>
muttered
the
Manager
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
Creditable
to
me
!
<EOS>
There
!
"
  
<EOS>
Pointing
to
the
heaps
of
opened
letters
,
he
turned
disdainfully
away
,
in
his
elbow
-
chair
,
and
broke
the
seal
of
that
one
which
he
held
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
trouble
you
,
James
,
"
said
the
brother
,
gathering
them
up
,
"
but
"
  
"
Oh
!
you
have
something
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
.
<EOS>
Well
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
did
not
raise
his
eyes
or
turn
them
on
his
brother
,
but
kept
them
on
his
letter
,
though
without
opening
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
he
repeated
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
uneasy
about
Harriet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Harriet
who
?
<EOS>
what
Harriet
?
<EOS>
I
know
nobody
of
that
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
well
,
and
has
changed
very
much
of
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
changed
very
much
,
a
great
many
years
ago
,
"
replied
the
Manager
;
"
and
that
is
all
I
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
if
you
would
hear
me
---
"
  
"
Why
should
I
hear
you
,
Brother
John
?
"
returned
the
Manager
,
laying
a
sarcastic
emphasis
on
those
two
words
,
and
throwing
up
his
head
,
but
not
lifting
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
Harriet
Carker
made
her
choice
many
years
ago
between
her
two
brothers
.
<EOS>
She
may
repent
it
,
but
she
must
abide
by
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
mistake
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
she
does
repent
it
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
black
ingratitude
in
me
to
hint
at
such
a
thing
,
"
returned
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Though
believe
me
,
James
,
I
am
as
sorry
for
her
sacrifice
as
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
I
?
"
exclaimed
the
Manager
.
<EOS>
"
As
I
?
"
  
"
As
sorry
for
her
choice
---
for
what
you
call
her
choice
---
as
you
are
angry
at
it
,
"
said
the
Junior
.
  
<EOS>
"
Angry
?
"
repeated
the
other
,
with
a
wide
show
of
his
teeth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Displeased
.
<EOS>
Whatever
word
you
like
best
.
<EOS>
You
know
my
meaning
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
offence
in
my
intention
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
offence
in
everything
you
do
,
"
replied
his
brother
,
glancing
at
him
with
a
sudden
scowl
,
which
in
a
moment
gave
place
to
a
wider
smile
than
the
last
.
<EOS>
"
Carry
those
papers
away
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
am
busy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
politeness
was
so
much
more
cutting
than
his
wrath
,
that
the
Junior
went
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
But
stopping
at
it
,
and
looking
round
,
he
said
:
  
"
When
Harriet
tried
in
vain
to
plead
for
me
with
you
,
on
your
first
just
indignation
,
and
my
first
disgrace
;
and
when
she
left
you
,
James
,
to
follow
my
broken
fortunes
,
and
devote
herself
,
in
her
mistaken
affection
,
to
a
ruined
brother
,
because
without
her
he
had
no
one
,
and
was
lost
;
she
was
young
and
pretty
.
<EOS>
I
think
if
you
could
see
her
now
---
if
you
would
go
and
see
her
---
she
would
move
your
admiration
and
compassion
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Manager
inclined
his
head
,
and
showed
his
teeth
,
as
who
should
say
,
in
answer
to
some
careless
small
-
talk
,
"
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
Is
that
the
case
?
"
but
said
never
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
thought
in
those
days
:
you
and
I
both
:
that
she
would
marry
young
,
and
lead
a
happy
and
light
-
hearted
life
,
"
pursued
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
if
you
knew
how
cheerfully
she
cast
those
hopes
away
;
how
cheerfully
she
has
gone
forward
on
the
path
she
took
,
and
never
once
looked
back
;
you
never
could
say
again
that
her
name
was
strange
in
your
ears
.
<EOS>
Never
!
"
  
<EOS>
Again
the
Manager
inclined
his
head
,
and
showed
his
teeth
,
and
seemed
to
say
,
"
Remarkable
indeed
!
<EOS>
You
quite
surprise
me
!
"
<EOS>
And
again
he
uttered
never
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
go
on
?
"
said
John
Carker
,
mildly
.
  
<EOS>
"
On
your
way
?
"
replied
his
smiling
brother
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
have
the
goodness
.
"
  
<EOS>
John
Carker
,
with
a
sigh
,
was
passing
slowly
out
at
the
door
,
when
his
brother
's
voice
detained
him
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
she
has
gone
,
and
goes
,
her
own
way
cheerfully
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
throwing
the
still
unfolded
letter
on
his
desk
,
and
putting
his
hands
firmly
in
his
pockets
,
"
you
may
tell
her
that
I
go
as
cheerfully
on
mine
.
<EOS>
If
she
has
never
once
looked
back
,
you
may
tell
her
that
I
have
,
sometimes
,
to
recall
her
taking
part
with
you
,
and
that
my
resolution
is
no
easier
to
wear
away
;
"
he
smiled
very
sweetly
here
;
"
than
marble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
her
nothing
of
you
.
<EOS>
We
never
speak
about
you
.
<EOS>
Once
a
year
,
on
your
birthday
,
Harriet
says
always
,
"
Let
us
remember
James
by
name
,
and
wish
him
happy
,
"
but
we
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
it
then
,
if
you
please
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
repeat
it
too
often
,
as
a
lesson
to
you
to
avoid
the
subject
in
speaking
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
Harriet
Carker
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
such
person
.
<EOS>
Youmay
have
a
sister
;
make
much
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
none
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
took
up
the
letter
again
,
and
waved
it
with
a
smile
of
mock
courtesy
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
Unfolding
it
as
his
brother
withdrew
,
and
looking
darkly
after
him
as
he
left
the
room
,
he
once
more
turned
round
in
his
elbow
-
chair
,
and
applied
himself
to
a
diligent
perusal
of
its
contents
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
writing
of
his
great
chief
,
Mr
Dombey
,
and
dated
from
Leamington
.
<EOS>
Though
he
was
a
quick
reader
of
all
other
letters
,
Mr
Carker
read
this
slowly
;
weighing
the
words
as
he
went
,
and
bringing
every
tooth
in
his
head
to
bear
upon
them
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
read
it
through
once
,
he
turned
it
over
again
,
and
picked
out
these
passages
.
<EOS>
"
I
find
myself
benefited
by
the
change
,
and
am
not
yet
inclined
to
name
any
time
for
my
return
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
Carker
,
you
would
arrange
to
come
down
once
and
see
me
here
,
and
let
me
know
how
things
are
going
on
,
in
person
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
omitted
to
speak
to
you
about
young
Gay
.
<EOS>
If
not
gone
per
Son
and
Heir
,
or
if
Son
and
Heir
still
lying
in
the
Docks
,
appoint
some
other
young
man
and
keep
him
in
the
City
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
decided
.
"
<EOS>
"
Now
that
's
unfortunate
!
"
said
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
,
expanding
his
mouth
,
as
if
it
were
made
of
India
-
rubber
:
"
for
he
is
far
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Still
that
passage
,
which
was
in
a
postscript
,
attracted
his
attention
and
his
teeth
,
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
he
said
,
"
my
good
friend
Captain
Cuttle
mentioned
something
about
being
towed
along
in
the
wake
of
that
day
.
<EOS>
What
a
pity
he
's
so
far
away
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
refolded
the
letter
,
and
was
sitting
trifling
with
it
,
standing
it
long
-
wise
and
broad
-
wise
on
his
table
,
and
turning
it
over
and
over
on
all
sides
---
doing
pretty
much
the
same
thing
,
perhaps
,
by
its
contents
---
when
Mr
Perch
the
messenger
knocked
softly
at
the
door
,
and
coming
in
on
tiptoe
,
bending
his
body
at
every
step
as
if
it
were
the
delight
of
his
life
to
bow
,
laid
some
papers
on
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
please
to
be
engaged
,
Sir
?
"
asked
Mr
Perch
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
and
deferentially
putting
his
head
on
one
side
,
like
a
man
who
felt
he
had
no
business
to
hold
it
up
in
such
a
presence
,
and
would
keep
it
as
much
out
of
the
way
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
wants
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Perch
,
in
a
soft
voice
,
"
really
nobody
,
Sir
,
to
speak
of
at
present
.
<EOS>
Mr
Gills
the
Ship
's
Instrument
-
maker
,
Sir
,
has
looked
in
,
about
a
little
matter
of
payment
,
he
says
:
<EOS>
but
I
mentioned
to
him
,
Sir
,
that
you
was
engaged
several
deep
;
several
deep
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Perch
coughed
once
behind
his
hand
,
and
waited
for
further
orders
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anybody
else
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Perch
,
"
I
would
n't
of
my
own
self
take
the
liberty
of
mentioning
,
Sir
,
that
there
was
anybody
else
;
but
that
same
young
lad
that
was
here
yesterday
,
Sir
,
and
last
week
,
has
been
hanging
about
the
place
;
and
it
looks
,
Sir
,
"
added
Mr
Perch
,
stopping
to
shut
the
door
,
"
dreadful
unbusiness
-
like
to
see
him
whistling
to
the
sparrows
down
the
court
,
and
making
of
'em
answer
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
said
he
wanted
something
to
do
,
did
n't
you
,
Perch
?
"
asked
Mr
Carker
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
looking
at
that
officer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Perch
,
coughing
behind
his
hand
again
<EOS>
,
"
his
expression
certainly
were
that
he
was
in
wants
of
a
sitiwation
,
and
that
he
considered
something
might
be
done
for
him
about
the
Docks
,
being
used
to
fishing
with
a
rod
and
line
:
<EOS>
but
---
"
Mr
Perch
shock
his
head
very
dubiously
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
he
say
when
he
comes
?
"
asked
Mr
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Perch
,
coughing
another
cough
behind
his
hand
,
which
was
always
his
resource
as
an
expression
of
humility
when
nothing
else
occurred
to
him
,
"
<EOS>
his
observation
generally
air
that
he
would
humbly
wish
to
see
one
of
the
gentlemen
,
and
that
he
wants
to
earn
a
living
.
<EOS>
But
you
see
,
Sir
,
"
added
Perch
,
dropping
his
voice
to
a
whisper
,
and
turning
,
in
the
inviolable
nature
of
his
confidence
,
to
give
the
door
a
thrust
with
his
hand
and
knee
,
as
if
that
would
shut
it
any
more
when
it
was
shut
already
,
"
it
's
hardly
to
be
bore
,
<EOS>
Sir
,
that
a
common
lad
like
that
should
come
a
prowling
here
,
and
saying
that
his
mother
nursed
our
House
's
young
gentleman
,
and
that
he
hopes
our
House
will
give
him
a
chance
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
Sir
,
"
observed
Mr
Perch
,
"
that
although
Mrs
Perch
was
at
that
time
nursing
as
thriving
a
little
girl
,
Sir
,
as
we
've
ever
took
the
liberty
of
adding
to
our
family
,
I
would
n't
have
made
so
free
<EOS>
as
drop
a
hint
of
her
being
capable
of
imparting
nourishment
,
not
if
it
was
never
so
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
grinned
at
him
like
a
shark
,
but
in
an
absent
,
thoughtful
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whether
,
"
submitted
Mr
Perch
,
after
a
short
silence
,
and
another
cough
,
"
it
might
n't
be
best
for
me
to
tell
him
,
that
if
he
was
seen
here
any
more
he
would
be
given
into
custody
;
and
to
keep
to
it
!
<EOS>
With
respect
to
bodily
fear
,
"
said
Mr
Perch
,
"
<EOS>
I
'm
so
timid
,
myself
,
by
nature
,
Sir
,
and
my
nerves
is
so
unstrung
by
Mrs
Perch
's
state
,
that
I
could
take
my
affidavit
easy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
this
fellow
,
Perch
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
Bring
him
in
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Begging
your
pardon
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Perch
,
hesitating
at
the
door
,
"
he
's
rough
,
Sir
,
in
appearance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
.
<EOS>
If
he
's
there
,
bring
him
in
.
<EOS>
I
'll
see
Mr
Gills
directly
.
<EOS>
Ask
him
to
wait
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Perch
bowed
;
and
shutting
the
door
,
as
precisely
and
carefully
as
if
he
were
not
coming
back
for
a
week
,
went
on
his
quest
among
the
sparrows
in
the
court
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
gone
,
Mr
Carker
assumed
his
favourite
attitude
before
the
fire
-
place
,
and
stood
looking
at
the
door
;
presenting
,
with
his
under
lip
tucked
into
the
smile
that
showed
his
whole
row
of
upper
teeth
,
a
singularly
crouching
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
The
messenger
was
not
long
in
returning
,
followed
by
a
pair
of
heavy
boots
that
came
bumping
along
the
passage
like
boxes
.
<EOS>
With
the
unceremonious
words
"
Come
along
with
you
!
"
<EOS>
---
a
very
unusual
form
of
introduction
from
his
lips
---
Mr
Perch
then
ushered
into
the
presence
a
strong
-
built
lad
of
fifteen
,
with
a
round
red
face
,
a
round
sleek
head
,
round
black
eyes
,
round
limbs
,
and
round
body
,
who
,
to
carry
out
the
general
rotundity
of
his
appearance
,
had
a
round
hat
in
his
hand
,
without
a
particle
of
brim
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
Obedient
to
a
nod
from
Mr
Carker
,
Perch
had
no
sooner
confronted
the
visitor
with
that
gentleman
than
he
withdrew
.
<EOS>
The
moment
they
were
face
to
face
alone
,
Mr
Carker
,
without
a
word
of
preparation
,
took
him
by
the
throat
,
and
shook
him
until
his
head
seemed
loose
upon
his
shoulders
.
  
<EOS>
The
boy
,
who
in
the
midst
of
his
astonishment
could
not
help
staring
wildly
at
the
gentleman
with
so
many
white
teeth
who
was
choking
him
,
and
at
the
office
walls
,
as
though
determined
,
if
he
were
choked
,
that
his
last
look
should
be
at
the
mysteries
for
his
intrusion
into
which
he
was
paying
such
a
severe
penalty
,
at
last
contrived
to
utter
---
   
"
Come
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
You
let
me
alone
,
will
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
you
alone
!
"
said
Mr
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
I
have
got
you
,
have
I
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
There
was
no
doubt
of
that
,
and
tightly
too
.
<EOS>
"
You
dog
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
through
his
set
jaws
,
"
I
'll
strangle
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Biler
whimpered
,
would
he
though
?
<EOS>
oh
no
<EOS>
he
would
n't
---
<EOS>
and
what
was
he
doing
of
---
and
why
did
n't
he
strangle
somebody
of
his
own
size
and
not
him
:
but
Biler
was
quelled
by
the
extraordinary
nature
of
his
reception
,
and
,
as
his
head
became
stationary
,
and
he
looked
the
gentleman
in
the
face
,
or
rather
in
the
teeth
,
and
saw
him
snarling
at
him
<EOS>
,
he
so
far
forgot
his
manhood
as
to
cry
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
done
nothing
to
you
,
Sir
,
"
said
Biler
,
otherwise
Rob
,
otherwise
Grinder
,
and
always
Toodle
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
young
scoundrel
!
"
replied
Mr
Carker
,
slowly
releasing
him
,
and
moving
back
a
step
into
his
favourite
position
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
daring
to
come
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
no
harm
,
Sir
,
"
whimpered
Rob
,
putting
one
hand
to
his
throat
,
and
the
knuckles
of
the
other
to
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
never
come
again
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
I
only
wanted
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Work
,
young
Cain
that
you
are
!
"
repeated
Mr
Carker
,
eyeing
him
narrowly
.
<EOS>
"
An't
you
the
idlest
vagabond
in
London
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
impeachment
,
while
it
much
affected
Mr
Toodle
Junior
,
attached
to
his
character
so
justly
,
that
he
could
not
say
a
word
in
denial
.
<EOS>
He
stood
looking
at
the
gentleman
,
therefore
,
with
a
frightened
,
self
-
convicted
,
and
remorseful
air
.
<EOS>
As
to
his
looking
at
him
,
it
may
be
observed
that
he
was
fascinated
by
Mr
Carker
,
and
never
took
his
round
eyes
off
him
for
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
An't
you
a
thief
?
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
with
his
hands
behind
him
in
his
pockets
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sir
,
"
pleaded
Rob
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
!
"
said
Mr
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
an't
indeed
,
Sir
,
"
whimpered
Rob
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
did
such
a
thing
as
thieve
,
Sir
,
if
you
'll
believe
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
've
been
going
wrong
,
Sir
,
ever
since
I
took
to
bird
-
catching
and
walking
-
matching
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
a
cove
might
think
,
"
said
Mr
Toodle
Junior
,
with
a
burst
of
penitence
,
"
that
singing
birds
was
innocent
company
,
but
nobody
knows
what
harm
is
in
them
little
creeturs
and
what
they
brings
you
down
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
seemed
to
have
brought
him
down
to
a
velveteen
jacket
and
trousers
very
much
the
worse
for
wear
,
a
particularly
small
red
waistcoat
like
a
gorget
,
an
interval
of
blue
check
,
and
the
hat
before
mentioned
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
an't
been
home
twenty
times
since
them
birds
got
their
will
of
me
,
"
said
Rob
,
"
and
that
's
ten
months
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
go
home
when
everybody
's
miserable
to
see
me
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
,
"
said
Biler
,
blubbering
outright
,
and
smearing
his
eyes
with
his
coat
-
cuff
,
"
that
I
have
n't
been
and
drownded
myself
over
and
over
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
All
of
which
,
including
his
expression
of
surprise
at
not
having
achieved
this
last
scarce
performance
,
the
boy
said
,
just
as
if
the
teeth
of
Mr
Carker
drew
it
out
of
him
,
and
he
had
no
power
of
concealing
anything
with
that
battery
of
attraction
in
full
play
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
nice
young
gentleman
!
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
shaking
his
head
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
hemp
-
seed
sown
for
you
,
my
fine
fellow
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
,
Sir
,
"
returned
the
wretched
Biler
,
blubbering
again
,
and
again
having
recourse
to
his
coat
-
cuff
:
"
I
should
n't
care
,
sometimes
,
if
it
was
growed
too
.
<EOS>
My
misfortunes
all
began
in
wagging
,
Sir
;
but
what
could
I
do
,
exceptin
'
wag
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Excepting
what
?
"
said
Mr
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wag
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Wagging
from
school
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
pretending
to
go
there
,
and
not
going
?
"
said
Mr
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Sir
,
that
's
wagging
,
Sir
,
"
returned
the
quondam
Grinder
,
much
affected
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
chivied
through
the
streets
,
Sir
,
when
I
went
there
,
and
pounded
when
I
got
there
.
<EOS>
So
I
wagged
and
hid
myself
,
and
that
began
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
mean
to
tell
me
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
taking
him
by
the
throat
again
,
holding
him
out
at
arm's
-
length
,
and
surveying
him
in
silence
for
some
moments
,
"
that
you
want
a
place
,
do
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
thankful
to
be
tried
,
Sir
,
"
returned
Toodle
Junior
,
faintly
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
pushed
him
backward
into
a
corner
---
the
boy
submitting
quietly
,
hardly
venturing
to
breathe
,
and
never
once
removing
his
eyes
from
his
face
---
and
rang
the
bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
Mr
Gills
to
come
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Perch
was
too
deferential
to
express
surprise
or
recognition
of
the
figure
in
the
corner
:
and
Uncle
Sol
appeared
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Gills
!
<EOS>
"
said
Carker
,
with
a
smile
,
"
sit
down
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
You
continue
to
enjoy
your
health
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Sir
,
"
returned
Uncle
Sol
,
taking
out
his
pocket
-
book
,
and
handing
over
some
notes
as
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
ails
me
in
body
but
old
age
.
<EOS>
Twenty
-
five
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
as
punctual
and
exact
,
Mr
Gills
,
"
replied
the
smiling
Manager
,
taking
a
paper
from
one
of
his
many
drawers
,
and
making
an
endorsement
on
it
,
while
Uncle
Sol
looked
over
him
,
"
as
one
of
your
own
chronometers
.
<EOS>
Quite
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Son
and
Heir
has
not
been
spoken
,
I
find
by
the
list
,
Sir
,
"
said
Uncle
Sol
,
with
a
slight
addition
to
the
usual
tremor
in
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Son
and
Heir
has
not
been
spoken
,
"
returned
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
There
seems
to
have
been
tempestuous
weather
,
Mr
Gills
,
and
she
has
probably
been
driven
out
of
her
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
safe
,
I
trust
in
Heaven
!
"
said
old
Sol
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
safe
,
I
trust
in
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
assented
Mr
Carker
in
that
voiceless
manner
of
his
:
which
made
the
observant
young
Toodle
tremble
again
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Gills
,
"
he
added
aloud
,
throwing
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
"
you
must
miss
your
nephew
very
much
?
"
  
<EOS>
Uncle
Sol
,
standing
by
him
,
shook
his
head
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Gills
,
"
said
Carker
,
with
his
soft
hand
playing
round
his
mouth
,
and
looking
up
into
the
Instrument
-
maker
's
face
,
"
it
would
be
company
to
you
to
have
a
young
fellow
in
your
shop
just
now
,
and
it
would
be
obliging
me
if
you
would
give
one
house
-
room
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
No
,
to
be
sure
,
"
he
added
quickly
,
in
anticipation
of
what
the
old
man
was
going
to
say
,
"
there
's
not
much
business
doing
there
,
I
know
;
but
you
can
make
him
clean
the
place
out
,
polish
up
the
instruments
;
drudge
,
Mr
Gills
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
lad
!
"
  
<EOS>
Sol
Gills
pulled
down
his
spectacles
from
his
forehead
to
his
eyes
,
and
looked
at
Toodle
Junior
standing
upright
in
the
corner
:
<EOS>
his
head
presenting
the
appearance
(
which
it
always
did
)
of
having
been
newly
drawn
out
of
a
bucket
of
cold
water
;
his
small
waistcoat
rising
and
falling
quickly
in
the
play
of
this
emotions
;
and
his
eyes
intently
fixed
on
Mr
Carker
,
without
the
least
reference
to
his
proposed
master
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
him
house
-
room
,
Mr
Gills
?
"
said
the
Manager
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Sol
,
without
being
quite
enthusiastic
on
the
subject
,
replied
that
he
was
glad
of
any
opportunity
,
however
slight
,
to
oblige
Mr
Carker
,
whose
wish
on
such
a
point
was
a
command
:
and
that
the
Wooden
Midshipman
would
consider
himself
happy
to
receive
in
his
berth
any
visitor
of
Mr
Carker
's
selecting
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
bared
himself
to
the
tops
and
bottoms
of
his
gums
:
making
the
watchful
Toodle
Junior
tremble
more
and
more
:
and
acknowledged
the
Instrument
-
maker
's
politeness
in
his
most
affable
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
dispose
of
him
so
,
then
,
Mr
Gills
,
"
he
answered
,
rising
,
and
shaking
the
old
man
by
the
hand
,
"
until
I
make
up
my
mind
what
to
do
with
him
,
and
what
he
deserves
.
<EOS>
As
I
consider
myself
responsible
for
him
,
Mr
Gills
,
<EOS>
"
here
he
smiled
a
wide
smile
at
Rob
,
who
shock
before
it
:
"
I
shall
be
glad
if
you
'll
look
sharply
after
him
,
and
report
his
behaviour
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
'll
ask
a
question
or
two
of
his
parents
as
I
ride
home
this
afternoon
---
respectable
people
---
to
confirm
some
particulars
in
his
own
account
of
himself
;
and
that
done
,
<EOS>
Mr
Gills
,
I
'll
send
him
round
to
you
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
smile
at
parting
was
so
full
of
teeth
,
that
it
confused
old
Sol
,
and
made
him
vaguely
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
He
went
home
,
thinking
of
raging
seas
,
foundering
ships
,
drowning
men
,
an
ancient
bottle
of
Madeira
never
brought
to
light
,
and
other
dismal
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
boy
!
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
putting
his
hand
on
young
Toodle
's
shoulder
,
and
bringing
him
out
into
the
middle
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
heard
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Rob
said
,
"
Yes
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
understand
,
"
pursued
his
patron
,
"
that
if
you
ever
deceive
or
play
tricks
with
me
,
you
had
better
have
drowned
yourself
,
indeed
,
once
for
all
,
before
you
came
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
in
any
branch
of
mental
acquisition
that
Rob
seemed
to
understand
better
than
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
lied
to
me
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
"
in
anything
,
never
come
in
my
way
again
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
you
may
let
me
find
you
waiting
for
me
somewhere
near
your
mother
's
house
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
I
shall
leave
this
at
five
o'clock
,
and
ride
there
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
Now
,
give
me
the
address
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Rob
repeated
it
slowly
,
as
Mr
Carker
wrote
it
down
.
<EOS>
Rob
even
spelt
it
over
a
second
time
,
letter
by
letter
,
as
if
he
thought
that
the
omission
of
a
dot
or
scratch
would
lead
to
his
destruction
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
then
handed
him
out
of
the
room
;
and
Rob
,
keeping
his
round
eyes
fixed
upon
his
patron
to
the
last
,
vanished
for
the
time
being
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
did
a
great
deal
of
business
in
the
course
of
the
day
,
and
bestowed
his
teeth
upon
a
great
many
people
.
<EOS>
In
the
office
,
in
the
court
,
in
the
street
,
and
on
'
Change
,
they
glistened
and
bristled
to
a
terrible
extent
.
<EOS>
Five
o'clock
arriving
,
and
with
it
Mr
Carker
's
bay
horse
,
they
got
on
horseback
,
and
went
gleaming
up
Cheapside
.
  
<EOS>
As
no
one
can
easily
ride
fast
,
even
if
inclined
to
do
so
,
through
the
press
and
throng
of
the
City
at
that
hour
,
and
as
Mr
Carker
was
not
inclined
,
he
went
leisurely
along
,
picking
his
way
among
the
carts
and
carriages
,
avoiding
whenever
he
could
<EOS>
the
wetter
and
more
dirty
places
in
the
over
-
watered
road
,
and
taking
infinite
pains
to
keep
himself
and
his
steed
clean
.
<EOS>
Glancing
at
the
passers
-
by
while
he
was
thus
ambling
on
his
way
,
he
suddenly
encountered
the
round
eyes
of
the
sleek
-
headed
Rob
intently
fixed
upon
his
face
as
if
they
had
never
been
taken
off
,
while
the
boy
himself
,
with
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
twisted
up
like
a
speckled
eel
and
girded
round
his
waist
,
made
a
very
conspicuous
demonstration
of
being
prepared
to
attend
upon
him
,
at
whatever
pace
he
might
think
proper
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
This
attention
,
however
flattering
,
being
one
of
an
unusual
kind
,
and
attracting
some
notice
from
the
other
passengers
,
Mr
Carker
took
advantage
of
a
clearer
thoroughfare
and
a
cleaner
road
,
and
broke
into
a
trot
.
<EOS>
Rob
immediately
did
the
same
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
presently
tried
a
canter
;
Rob
was
still
in
attendance
.
<EOS>
Then
a
short
gallop
;
it
was
all
one
to
the
boy
.
<EOS>
Whenever
Mr
Carker
turned
his
eyes
to
that
side
of
the
road
,
he
still
saw
Toodle
Junior
holding
his
course
,
apparently
without
distress
,
and
working
himself
along
by
the
elbows
after
the
most
approved
manner
of
professional
gentlemen
who
get
over
the
ground
for
wagers
.
  
<EOS>
Ridiculous
as
this
attendance
was
,
it
was
a
sign
of
an
influence
established
over
the
boy
,
and
therefore
Mr
Carker
,
affecting
not
to
notice
it
,
rode
away
into
the
neighbourhood
of
Mr
Toodle
's
house
.
<EOS>
On
his
slackening
his
pace
here
,
Rob
appeared
before
him
to
point
out
the
turnings
;
and
when
he
called
to
a
man
at
a
neighbouring
gateway
to
hold
his
horse
,
pending
his
visit
to
the
Buildings
that
had
succeeded
Staggs
's
Gardens
,
Rob
dutifully
held
the
stirrup
,
while
the
Manager
dismounted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
taking
him
by
the
shoulder
,
"
come
along
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
prodigal
son
was
evidently
nervous
of
visiting
the
parental
abode
;
but
Mr
Carker
pushing
him
on
before
,
he
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
open
the
right
door
,
and
suffer
himself
to
be
walked
into
the
midst
of
his
brothers
and
sisters
,
mustered
in
overwhelming
force
round
the
family
tea
-
table
.
<EOS>
At
sight
of
the
prodigal
in
the
grasp
of
a
stranger
,
these
tender
relations
united
in
a
general
howl
,
which
smote
upon
the
prodigal
's
breast
so
sharply
when
he
saw
his
mother
stand
up
among
them
,
pale
and
trembling
,
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
,
that
he
lent
his
own
voice
to
the
chorus
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
doubting
now
that
the
stranger
,
if
not
Mr
Ketch
in
person
,
was
one
of
that
company
,
the
whole
of
the
young
family
wailed
the
louder
,
while
its
more
infantine
members
,
unable
to
control
the
transports
of
emotion
appertaining
to
their
time
of
life
,
threw
themselves
on
their
backs
like
young
birds
when
terrified
by
a
hawk
,
and
kicked
violently
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
poor
Polly
making
herself
audible
,
said
,
with
quivering
lips
,
"
Oh
Rob
,
my
poor
boy
,
what
have
you
done
at
last
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
mother
,
"
cried
Rob
,
in
a
piteous
voice
,
"
ask
the
gentleman
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
alarmed
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
"
I
want
to
do
him
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
announcement
,
Polly
,
who
had
not
cried
yet
,
began
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
The
elder
Toodles
,
who
appeared
to
have
been
meditating
a
rescue
,
unclenched
their
fists
.
<EOS>
The
younger
Toodles
clustered
round
their
mother
's
gown
,
and
peeped
from
under
their
own
chubby
arms
at
their
desperado
brother
and
his
unknown
friend
.
<EOS>
Everybody
blessed
the
gentleman
with
the
beautiful
teeth
,
who
wanted
to
do
good
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
fellow
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
to
Polly
,
giving
him
a
gentle
shake
,
"
is
your
son
,
eh
,
Ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Sir
,
"
sobbed
Polly
,
with
a
curtsey
;
"
yes
,
Sir
,
"
  
"
A
bad
son
<EOS>
,
I
am
afraid
?
"
said
Mr
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
a
bad
son
to
me
,
Sir
,
"
returned
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
whom
then
?
"
said
Mr
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
a
little
wild
,
Sir
,
"
returned
Polly
,
checking
the
baby
,
who
was
making
convulsive
efforts
with
his
arms
and
legs
to
launch
himself
on
Biler
,
through
the
ambient
air
,
"
and
has
gone
with
wrong
companions
:
but
I
hope
he
has
seen
the
misery
of
that
,
Sir
,
and
will
do
well
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
looked
at
Polly
,
and
the
clean
room
,
and
the
clean
children
,
and
the
simple
Toodle
face
,
combined
of
father
and
mother
,
that
was
reflected
and
repeated
everywhere
about
him
---
and
seemed
to
have
achieved
the
real
purpose
of
his
visit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
husband
,
I
take
it
,
is
not
at
home
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Polly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
down
the
line
at
present
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
prodigal
Rob
seemed
very
much
relieved
to
hear
it
:
though
still
in
the
absorption
of
all
his
faculties
in
his
patron
,
he
hardly
took
his
eyes
from
Mr
Carker
's
face
,
unless
for
a
moment
at
a
time
to
steal
a
sorrowful
glance
at
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
"
I
'll
tell
you
how
I
have
stumbled
on
this
boy
of
yours
,
and
who
I
am
,
and
what
I
am
going
to
do
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
Mr
Carker
did
,
in
his
own
way
;
saying
that
he
at
first
intended
to
have
accumulated
nameless
terrors
on
his
presumptuous
head
,
for
coming
to
the
whereabout
of
Dombey
and
Son
.
<EOS>
That
he
had
relented
,
in
consideration
of
his
youth
,
his
professed
contribution
,
and
his
friends
.
<EOS>
That
he
was
afraid
he
took
a
rash
step
in
doing
anything
for
the
boy
,
and
one
that
might
expose
him
to
the
censure
of
the
prudent
;
but
that
he
did
it
of
himself
and
for
himself
,
and
risked
the
consequences
single
-
handed
;
and
that
his
mother
's
past
connection
with
Mr
Dombey
's
family
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
and
that
Mr
Dombey
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
but
that
he
,
Mr
Carker
,
was
the
be
-
all
and
the
end
-
all
of
this
business
.
<EOS>
Taking
great
credit
to
himself
for
his
goodness
,
and
receiving
no
less
from
all
the
family
then
present
,
Mr
Carker
signified
,
indirectly
but
still
pretty
plainly
,
that
Rob
's
implicit
fidelity
,
attachment
,
and
devotion
,
were
for
evermore
his
due
,
and
the
least
homage
he
could
receive
.
<EOS>
And
with
this
great
truth
Rob
himself
was
so
impressed
,
that
standing
gazing
on
his
patron
with
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks
,
he
nodded
his
shiny
head
until
it
seemed
almost
as
loose
as
it
had
done
under
the
same
patron
's
hands
that
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Polly
,
who
had
passed
Heaven
knows
how
many
sleepless
nights
on
account
of
this
her
dissipated
firstborn
,
and
had
not
seen
him
for
weeks
and
weeks
,
could
have
almost
kneeled
to
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
,
as
to
a
Good
Spirit
---
in
spite
of
his
teeth
.
<EOS>
But
Mr
Carker
rising
to
depart
,
she
only
thanked
him
with
her
mother
's
prayers
and
blessings
;
thanks
so
rich
when
paid
out
of
the
Heart
's
mint
,
especially
for
any
service
Mr
Carker
had
rendered
,
that
he
might
have
given
back
a
large
amount
of
change
,
and
yet
been
overpaid
.
  
<EOS>
As
that
gentleman
made
his
way
among
the
crowding
children
to
the
door
,
Rob
retreated
on
his
mother
,
and
took
her
and
the
baby
in
the
same
repentant
hug
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
try
hard
,
dear
mother
,
now
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
soul
I
will
!
"
said
Rob
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
do
,
my
dear
boy
!
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
will
,
for
our
sakes
and
your
own
!
"
cried
Polly
,
kissing
him
.
"
<EOS>
But
you
're
coming
back
to
speak
to
me
,
when
you
have
seen
the
gentleman
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
mother
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rob
hesitated
,
and
looked
down
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Father
---
when
's
he
coming
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
till
two
o'clock
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
come
back
,
mother
dear
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rob
.
<EOS>
And
passing
through
the
shrill
cry
of
his
brothers
and
sisters
in
reception
of
this
promise
,
he
followed
Mr
Carker
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
who
had
heard
this
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
bad
father
,
have
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sir
!
"
returned
Rob
,
amazed
.
<EOS>
"
There
ai
n't
a
better
nor
a
kinder
father
going
,
than
mine
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
want
to
see
him
then
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
his
patron
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
such
a
difference
between
a
father
and
a
mother
,
Sir
,
"
said
Rob
,
after
faltering
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
could
n't
hardly
believe
yet
that
I
was
going
to
do
better
---
though
I
know
he
'd
try
to
---
but
a
mother
---
she
always
believes
what
's
good
,
Sir
;
at
least
I
know
my
mother
does
,
God
bless
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
's
mouth
expanded
,
but
he
said
no
more
until
he
was
mounted
on
his
horse
,
and
had
dismissed
the
man
who
held
it
,
when
,
looking
down
from
the
saddle
steadily
into
the
attentive
and
watchful
face
of
the
boy
,
he
said
:
  
"
You
'll
come
to
me
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
you
shall
be
shown
where
that
old
gentleman
lives
;
that
old
gentleman
who
was
with
me
this
morning
;
where
you
are
going
,
as
you
heard
me
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
Sir
,
"
returned
Rob
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
great
interest
in
that
old
gentleman
,
and
in
serving
him
,
you
serve
me
,
boy
<EOS>
,
do
you
understand
?
<EOS>
Well
,
"
he
added
,
interrupting
him
,
for
he
saw
his
round
face
brighten
when
he
was
told
that
:
"
I
see
you
do
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
all
about
that
old
gentleman
,
and
how
he
goes
on
from
day
to
day
---
for
I
am
anxious
to
be
of
service
to
him
---
and
especially
who
comes
there
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
?
"
   
<EOS>
Rob
nodded
his
steadfast
face
,
and
said
"
Yes
,
Sir
,
"
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
know
that
he
has
friends
who
are
attentive
to
him
,
and
that
they
do
n't
desert
him
---
<EOS>
for
he
lives
very
much
alone
now
,
poor
fellow
;
but
that
they
are
fond
of
him
,
and
of
his
nephew
who
has
gone
abroad
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
very
young
lady
who
may
perhaps
come
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
I
want
particularly
to
know
all
about
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
care
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
take
care
,
"
returned
his
patron
,
bending
forward
to
advance
his
grinning
face
closer
to
the
boy
's
,
and
pat
him
on
the
shoulder
with
the
handle
of
his
whip
:
"
take
care
<EOS>
you
talk
about
affairs
of
mine
to
nobody
but
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
nobody
in
the
world
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Rob
,
shaking
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Neither
there
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
pointing
to
the
place
they
had
just
left
,
"
nor
anywhere
else
.
<EOS>
I
'll
try
how
true
and
grateful
you
can
be
.
<EOS>
I
'll
prove
you

"
<EOS>
Making
this
,
by
his
display
of
teeth
and
by
the
action
of
his
head
,
as
much
a
threat
as
a
promise
,
he
turned
from
Rob
's
eyes
,
which
were
nailed
upon
him
as
if
he
had
won
the
boy
by
a
charm
,
body
and
soul
,
and
rode
away
.
<EOS>
But
again
becoming
conscious
,
after
trotting
a
short
distance
,
that
his
devoted
henchman
,
girt
as
before
,
was
yielding
him
the
same
attendance
,
to
the
great
amusement
of
sundry
spectators
,
he
reined
up
,
and
ordered
him
off
.
<EOS>
To
insure
his
obedience
,
he
turned
in
the
saddle
and
watched
him
as
he
retired
.
<EOS>
It
was
curious
to
see
that
even
then
Rob
could
not
keep
his
eyes
wholly
averted
from
his
patron
's
face
,
but
,
constantly
turning
and
turning
again
to
look
after
him
,
involved
himself
in
a
tempest
of
buffetings
and
jostlings
from
the
other
passengers
in
the
street
:
of
which
,
in
the
pursuit
of
the
one
paramount
idea
,
he
was
perfectly
heedless
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
rode
on
at
a
foot
-
pace
,
with
the
easy
air
of
one
who
had
performed
all
the
business
of
the
day
in
a
satisfactory
manner
,
and
got
it
comfortably
off
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Complacent
and
affable
as
man
could
be
,
Mr
Carker
picked
his
way
along
the
streets
and
hummed
a
soft
tune
as
he
went
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
purr
,
he
was
so
glad
.
  
<EOS>
And
in
some
sort
,
Mr
Carker
,
in
his
fancy
,
basked
upon
a
hearth
too
.
<EOS>
Coiled
up
snugly
at
certain
feet
,
he
was
ready
for
a
spring
,
or
for
a
tear
,
or
for
a
scratch
,
or
for
a
velvet
touch
,
as
the
humour
took
him
and
occasion
served
.
<EOS>
Was
there
any
bird
in
a
cage
,
that
came
in
for
a
share
of
his
regards
?
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
young
lady
!
<EOS>
"
thought
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
,
through
his
song
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ay
!
<EOS>
when
I
saw
her
last
,
she
was
a
little
child
.
<EOS>
With
dark
eyes
and
hair
,
I
recollect
,
and
a
good
face
;
a
very
good
face
!
<EOS>
I
dare
say
she
's
pretty
.
"
  
<EOS>
More
affable
and
pleasant
yet
,
and
humming
his
song
until
his
many
teeth
vibrated
to
it
,
Mr
Carker
picked
his
way
along
,
and
turned
at
last
into
the
shady
street
where
Mr
Dombey
's
house
stood
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
so
busy
,
winding
webs
round
good
faces
,
and
obscuring
them
with
meshes
,
that
he
hardly
thought
of
being
at
this
point
of
his
ride
,
until
,
glancing
down
the
cold
perspective
of
tall
houses
,
he
reined
in
his
horse
quickly
within
a
few
yards
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
But
to
explain
why
Mr
Carker
reined
in
his
horse
quickly
,
and
what
he
looked
at
in
no
small
surprise
,
a
few
digressive
words
are
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
emancipated
from
the
Blimber
thraldom
and
coming
into
the
possession
of
a
certain
portion
of
his
worldly
wealth
,
"
<EOS>
which
,
"
as
he
had
been
wo
nt
,
during
his
last
half
-
year
's
probation
,
to
communicate
to
Mr
Feeder
every
evening
as
a
new
discovery
,
"
the
executors
could
n't
keep
him
out
of
,
"
had
applied
himself
,
with
great
diligence
,
to
the
science
of
Life
.
<EOS>
Fired
with
a
noble
emulation
to
pursue
a
brilliant
and
distinguished
career
,
Mr
Toots
had
furnished
a
choice
set
of
apartments
;
had
established
among
them
a
sporting
bower
,
embellished
with
the
portraits
of
winning
horses
,
in
which
he
took
no
particle
of
interest
;
and
a
divan
,
which
made
him
poorly
.
<EOS>
In
this
delicious
abode
,
Mr
Toots
devoted
himself
to
the
cultivation
of
those
gentle
arts
which
refine
and
humanise
existence
,
his
chief
instructor
in
which
was
an
interesting
character
called
the
Game
Chicken
,
who
was
always
to
be
heard
of
at
the
bar
of
the
Black
Badger
,
wore
a
shaggy
white
great
-
coat
in
the
warmest
weather
,
and
knocked
Mr
Toots
about
the
head
three
times
a
week
,
for
the
small
consideration
of
ten
and
six
per
visit
.
   
<EOS>
The
Game
Chicken
,
who
was
quite
the
Apollo
of
Mr
Toots
's
Pantheon
,
had
introduced
to
him
a
marker
who
taught
billiards
,
a
Life
Guard
who
taught
fencing
,
a
job
-
master
who
taught
riding
,
a
Cornish
gentleman
who
was
up
to
anything
in
the
athletic
line
,
and
two
or
three
other
friends
connected
no
less
intimately
with
the
fine
arts
.
<EOS>
Under
whose
auspices
Mr
Toots
could
hardly
fail
to
improve
apace
,
and
under
whose
tuition
he
went
to
work
.
  
<EOS>
But
however
it
came
about
<EOS>
,
it
came
to
pass
,
even
while
these
gentlemen
had
the
gloss
of
novelty
upon
them
,
that
Mr
Toots
felt
,
he
did
n't
know
how
,
unsettled
and
uneasy
.
<EOS>
There
were
husks
in
his
corn
,
that
even
Game
Chickens
could
n't
peck
up
;
gloomy
giants
in
his
leisure
,
that
even
Game
Chickens
could
n't
knock
down
.
<EOS>
Nothing
seemed
to
do
Mr
Toots
so
much
good
as
incessantly
leaving
cards
at
Mr
Dombey
's
door
.
<EOS>
No
tax
-
gatherer
in
the
British
dominions
---
that
wide
-
spread
territory
on
which
the
sun
never
sets
,
and
where
the
tax
-
gatherer
never
goes
to
bed
---
was
more
regular
and
persevering
in
his
calls
than
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
never
went
up
stairs
;
and
always
performed
the
same
ceremonies
,
richly
dressed
for
the
purpose
,
at
the
hall
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Good
morning
!
<EOS>
"
would
be
Mr
Toots
's
first
remark
to
the
servant
.
"
<EOS>
For
Mr
Dombey
,
"
would
be
Mr
Toots
's
next
remark
,
as
he
handed
in
a
card
.
"
<EOS>
For
Miss
Dombey
,
"
would
be
his
next
,
as
he
handed
in
another
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
would
then
turn
round
as
if
to
go
away
;
but
the
man
knew
him
by
this
time
,
and
knew
he
would
n't
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
Mr
Toots
would
say
,
as
if
a
thought
had
suddenly
descended
on
him
.
"
<EOS>
Is
the
young
woman
at
home
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
would
rather
think
she
was
,
but
would
n't
quite
know
.
<EOS>
Then
he
would
ring
a
bell
that
rang
upstairs
,
and
would
look
up
the
staircase
,
and
would
say
,
yes
,
she
was
at
home
,
and
was
coming
down
.
<EOS>
Then
Miss
Nipper
would
appear
,
and
the
man
would
retire
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
How
de
do
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
would
say
,
with
a
chuckle
and
a
blush
.
  
<EOS>
Susan
would
thank
him
,
and
say
she
was
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
's
Diogenes
going
on
?
"
would
be
Mr
Toot
's
second
interrogation
.
  
<EOS>
Very
well
indeed
.
<EOS>
Miss
Florence
was
fonder
and
fonder
of
him
every
day
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
was
sure
to
hail
this
with
a
burst
of
chuckles
,
like
the
opening
of
a
bottle
of
some
effervescent
beverage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Florence
is
quite
well
,
Sir
,
"
Susan
would
add
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
of
no
consequence
,
thank'ee
,
"
was
the
invariable
reply
of
Mr
Toots
;
and
when
he
had
said
so
,
he
always
went
away
very
fast
.
  
<EOS>
Now
it
is
certain
that
Mr
Toots
had
a
filmy
something
in
his
mind
,
which
led
him
to
conclude
that
if
he
could
aspire
successfully
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
to
the
hand
of
Florence
,
he
would
be
fortunate
and
blest
.
<EOS>
It
is
certain
that
Mr
Toots
,
by
some
remote
and
roundabout
road
,
had
got
to
that
point
,
and
that
there
he
made
a
stand
.
<EOS>
His
heart
was
wounded
;
he
was
touched
;
he
was
in
love
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
a
desperate
attempt
,
one
night
,
and
had
sat
up
all
night
for
the
purpose
,
to
write
an
acrostic
on
Florence
,
which
affected
him
to
tears
in
the
conception
.
<EOS>
But
he
never
proceeded
in
the
execution
further
than
the
words
"
<EOS>
For
when
I
gaze
,
"
---
the
flow
of
imagination
in
which
he
had
previously
written
down
the
initial
letters
of
the
other
seven
lines
,
deserting
him
at
that
point
.
  
<EOS>
Beyond
devising
that
very
artful
and
politic
measure
of
leaving
a
card
for
Mr
Dombey
daily
,
the
brain
of
Mr
Toots
had
not
worked
much
in
reference
to
the
subject
that
held
his
feelings
prisoner
.
<EOS>
But
deep
consideration
at
length
assured
Mr
Toots
that
an
important
step
to
gain
,
was
,
the
conciliation
of
Miss
Susan
Nipper
,
preparatory
to
giving
her
some
inkling
of
his
state
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
A
little
light
and
playful
gallantry
towards
this
lady
seemed
the
means
to
employ
in
that
early
chapter
of
the
history
,
for
winning
her
to
his
interests
.
<EOS>
Not
being
able
quite
to
make
up
his
mind
about
it
,
he
consulted
the
Chicken
---
without
taking
that
gentleman
into
his
confidence
;
merely
informing
him
that
a
friend
in
Yorkshire
had
written
to
him
(
Mr
Toots
)
for
his
opinion
on
such
a
question
.
<EOS>
The
Chicken
replying
that
his
opinion
always
was
,
"
Go
in
and
win
,
"
and
further
,
"
When
your
man
's
before
you
and
your
work
cut
out
,
go
in
and
do
it
,
"
Mr
Toots
considered
this
a
figurative
way
of
supporting
his
own
view
of
the
case
,
and
heroically
resolved
to
kiss
Miss
Nipper
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
the
next
day
,
therefore
,
Mr
Toots
,
putting
into
requisition
some
of
the
greatest
marvels
that
Burgess
and
Co.
had
ever
turned
out
,
went
off
to
Mr
Dombey
's
upon
this
design
.
<EOS>
But
his
heart
failed
him
so
much
as
he
approached
the
scene
of
action
,
that
,
although
he
arrived
on
the
ground
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
it
was
six
before
he
knocked
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Everything
happened
as
usual
,
down
to
the
point
where
Susan
said
her
young
mistress
was
well
,
and
Mr
Toots
said
it
was
of
no
consequence
.
<EOS>
To
her
amazement
,
Mr
Toots
,
instead
of
going
off
like
a
rocket
,
after
that
observation
,
lingered
and
chuckled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
'd
like
to
walk
up
stairs
,
Sir
!
"
said
Susan
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
think
I
will
come
in
!
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
But
instead
of
walking
up
stairs
,
the
bold
Toots
made
an
awkward
plunge
at
Susan
when
the
door
was
shut
,
and
embracing
that
fair
creature
,
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
along
with
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Susan
,
"
or
I
'll
tear
your
eyes
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
another
!
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
along
with
you
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Susan
,
giving
him
a
push
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Innocents
like
you
,
too
!
<EOS>
Who
'll
begin
next
?
<EOS>
Go
along
,
Sir
!
"
  
<EOS>
Susan
was
not
in
any
serious
strait
,
for
she
could
hardly
speak
for
laughing
;
but
Diogenes
,
on
the
staircase
,
hearing
a
rustling
against
the
wall
,
and
a
shuffling
of
feet
,
and
seeing
through
the
banisters
that
there
was
some
contention
going
on
,
and
foreign
invasion
in
the
house
,
formed
a
different
opinion
,
dashed
down
to
the
rescue
,
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
had
Mr
Toots
by
the
leg
.
  
<EOS>
Susan
screamed
,
laughed
,
opened
the
street
-
door
,
and
ran
down
stairs
;
the
bold
Toots
tumbled
staggering
out
into
the
street
,
with
Diogenes
holding
on
to
one
leg
of
his
pantaloons
,
as
if
Burgess
and
Co.
were
his
cooks
,
and
had
provided
that
dainty
morsel
for
his
holiday
entertainment
;
Diogenes
shaken
off
,
rolled
over
and
over
in
the
dust
,
got
up
again
,
whirled
round
the
giddy
Toots
and
snapped
at
him
:
and
all
this
turmoil
,
Mr
Carker
,
reining
up
his
horse
and
sitting
a
little
at
a
distance
,
saw
to
his
amazement
,
<EOS>
issue
from
the
stately
house
of
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
remained
watching
the
discomfited
Toots
,
when
Diogenes
was
called
in
,
and
the
door
shut
:
and
while
that
gentleman
,
taking
refuge
in
a
doorway
near
at
hand
,
bound
up
the
torn
leg
of
his
pantaloons
with
a
costly
silk
handkerchief
that
had
formed
part
of
his
expensive
outfit
for
the
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
riding
up
,
with
his
most
propitiatory
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
are
not
hurt
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
thank
you
,
"
replied
Mr
Toots
,
raising
his
flushed
face
,
"
it
's
of
no
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
would
have
signified
,
if
he
could
,
that
he
liked
it
very
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
the
dog
's
teeth
have
entered
the
leg
,
Sir
---
"
began
Carker
,
with
a
display
of
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
it
's
all
quite
right
.
<EOS>
It
's
very
comfortable
,
thank
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
pleasure
of
knowing
Mr
Dombey
,
"
observed
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
though
?
"
rejoined
the
blushing
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
allow
me
,
perhaps
,
to
apologise
,
in
his
absence
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
taking
off
his
hat
,
"
for
such
a
misadventure
,
and
to
wonder
how
it
can
possibly
have
happened
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
is
so
much
gratified
by
this
politeness
,
and
the
lucky
chance
of
making
friends
with
a
friend
of
Mr
Dombey
,
that
he
pulls
out
his
card
-
case
,
which
he
never
loses
an
opportunity
of
using
,
and
hands
his
name
and
address
to
Mr
Carker
:
who
responds
to
that
courtesy
by
giving
him
his
own
,
and
with
that
they
part
.
  
<EOS>
As
Mr
Carker
picks
his
way
so
softly
past
the
house
,
glancing
up
at
the
windows
,
and
trying
to
make
out
the
pensive
face
behind
the
curtain
looking
at
the
children
opposite
,
the
rough
head
of
Diogenes
came
clambering
up
close
by
it
,
and
the
dog
,
regardless
of
all
soothing
,
barks
and
growls
,
and
makes
at
him
from
that
height
,
as
if
he
would
spring
down
and
tear
him
limb

Well

your

along

Chapter

<EOS>
Florence
solitary
,
and
the
Midshipman
mysterious
 
FLORENCE
lived
alone
in
the
great
dreary
house
,
and
day
succeeded
day
,
and
still
she
lived
alone
;
and
the
blank
walls
looked
down
upon
her
with
a
vacant
stare
,
as
if
they
had
a
Gorgon
-
like
mind
to
stare
her
youth
and
beauty
into
stone
.
  
<EOS>
No
magic
dwelling
-
place
in
magic
story
,
shut
up
in
the
heart
of
a
thick
wood
,
was
ever
more
solitary
and
deserted
to
the
fancy
,
than
was
her
father
's
mansion
in
its
grim
reality
,
as
it
stood
lowering
on
the
street
:
always
by
night
,
when
lights
were
shining
from
neighbouring
windows
,
a
blot
upon
its
scanty
brightness
;
always
by
day
,
a
frown
upon
its
never
-
smiling
face
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
not
two
dragon
sentries
keeping
ward
before
the
gate
of
this
abode
,
as
in
magic
legend
are
usually
found
on
duty
over
the
wronged
innocence
imprisoned
;
but
besides
a
glowering
visage
,
with
its
thin
lips
parted
wickedly
,
that
surveyed
all
comers
from
above
the
archway
of
the
door
,
there
was
a
monstrous
fantasy
of
rusty
iron
,
curling
and
twisting
like
a
petrifaction
of
an
arbour
over
the
threshold
,
budding
in
spikes
and
corkscrew
points
,
and
bearing
,
one
on
either
side
,
two
ominous
extinguishers
,
<EOS>
that
seemed
to
say
,
"
Who
enter
here
,
leave
light
behind
!
<EOS>
"
There
were
no
talismanic
characters
engraven
on
the
portal
,
but
the
house
was
now
so
neglected
in
appearance
,
that
boys
chalked
the
railings
and
the
pavement
---
particularly
round
the
corner
where
the
side
wall
was
---
and
drew
ghosts
on
the
stable
door
;
and
being
sometimes
driven
off
by
Mr
Towlinson
,
made
portraits
of
him
,
in
return
,
with
his
ears
growing
out
horizontally
from
under
his
hat
.
<EOS>
Noise
ceased
to
be
,
within
the
shadow
of
the
roof
.
<EOS>
The
brass
band
that
came
into
the
street
once
a
week
,
in
the
morning
,
never
brayed
a
note
in
at
those
windows
;
but
all
such
company
,
down
to
a
poor
little
piping
organ
of
weak
intellect
,
with
an
imbecile
party
of
automaton
dancers
,
waltzing
in
and
out
at
folding
-
doors
,
fell
off
from
it
with
one
accord
,
and
shunned
it
as
a
hopeless
place
.
  
<EOS>
The
spell
upon
it
was
more
wasting
than
the
spell
that
used
to
set
enchanted
houses
sleeping
once
upon
a
time
but
left
their
waking
freshness
unimpaired
.
  
<EOS>
The
passive
desolation
of
disuse
was
everywhere
silently
manifest
about
it
.
<EOS>
Within
doors
,
curtains
,
drooping
heavily
,
lost
their
old
folds
and
shapes
,
and
hung
like
cumbrous
palls
.
<EOS>
Hecatombs
of
furniture
,
still
piled
and
covered
up
,
shrunk
like
imprisoned
and
forgotten
men
,
and
changed
insensibly
.
<EOS>
Mirrors
were
dim
as
with
the
breath
of
years
.
<EOS>
Patterns
of
carpets
faded
and
became
perplexed
and
faint
,
like
the
memory
of
those
years
'
trifling
incidents
.
<EOS>
Boards
,
starting
at
unwonted
footsteps
,
creaked
and
shook
.
<EOS>
Keys
rusted
in
the
locks
of
doors
.
<EOS>
Damp
started
on
the
walls
,
and
as
the
stains
came
out
,
the
pictures
seemed
to
go
in
and
secrete
themselves
.
<EOS>
Mildew
and
mould
began
to
lurk
in
closets
.
<EOS>
Fungus
trees
grew
in
corners
of
the
cellars
.
<EOS>
Dust
accumulated
,
nobody
knew
whence
nor
how
;
spiders
,
moths
,
and
grubs
were
heard
of
every
day
.
<EOS>
An
exploratory
blackbeetle
now
and
then
was
found
immovable
upon
the
stairs
,
or
in
an
upper
room
,
as
wondering
how
he
got
there
.
<EOS>
Rats
began
to
squeak
and
scuffle
in
the
night
time
,
through
dark
galleries
they
mined
behind
the
panelling
.
  
<EOS>
The
dreary
magnificence
of
the
state
rooms
,
seen
imperfectly
by
the
doubtful
light
admitted
through
closed
shutters
,
would
have
answered
well
enough
for
an
enchanted
abode
.
<EOS>
Such
as
the
tarnished
paws
of
gilded
lions
,
stealthily
put
out
from
beneath
their
wrappers
;
the
marble
lineaments
of
busts
on
pedestals
,
fearfully
revealing
themselves
through
veils
;
the
clocks
that
never
told
the
time
,
or
,
if
wound
up
by
any
chance
,
told
it
wrong
,
and
struck
unearthly
numbers
,
which
are
not
upon
the
dial
;
the
accidental
tinklings
among
the
pendant
lustres
,
more
startling
than
alarm
-
bells
;
the
softened
sounds
and
laggard
air
that
made
their
way
among
these
objects
,
and
a
phantom
crowd
of
others
,
shrouded
and
hooded
,
and
made
spectral
of
shade
.
<EOS>
But
,
besides
,
there
was
the
great
staircase
,
where
the
lord
of
the
place
so
rarely
set
his
foot
,
and
by
which
his
little
child
had
gone
up
to
Heaven
.
<EOS>
There
were
other
staircases
and
passages
where
no
one
went
for
weeks
together
;
there
were
two
closed
rooms
associated
with
dead
members
of
the
family
,
and
with
whispered
recollections
of
them
;
and
to
all
the
house
but
Florence
,
there
was
a
gentle
figure
moving
through
the
solitude
and
gloom
,
that
gave
to
every
lifeless
thing
a
touch
of
present
human
interest
and
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
For
Florence
lived
alone
in
the
deserted
house
,
and
day
succeeded
day
,
and
still
she
lived
alone
,
and
the
cold
walls
looked
down
upon
her
with
a
vacant
stare
,
as
if
they
had
a
Gorgon
-
like
mind
to
stare
her
youth
and
beauty
into
stone
.
  
<EOS>
The
grass
began
to
grow
upon
the
roof
,
and
in
the
crevices
of
the
basement
paving
.
<EOS>
A
scaly
crumbling
vegetation
sprouted
round
the
window
-
sills
.
<EOS>
Fragments
of
mortar
lost
their
hold
upon
the
insides
of
the
unused
chimneys
,
and
came
dropping
down
.
<EOS>
The
two
trees
with
the
smoky
trunks
were
blighted
high
up
,
and
the
withered
branches
domineered
above
the
leaves
.
<EOS>
Through
the
whole
building
white
had
turned
yellow
,
yellow
nearly
black
;
and
since
the
time
when
the
poor
lady
died
,
it
had
slowly
become
a
dark
gap
in
the
long
monotonous
street
.
  
<EOS>
But
Florence
bloomed
there
,
like
the
king
's
fair
daughter
in
the
story
.
<EOS>
Her
books
,
her
music
,
and
her
daily
teachers
,
were
<EOS>
her
only
real
companions
,
Susan
Nipper
and
Diogenes
excepted
:
of
whom
the
former
,
in
her
attendance
on
the
studies
of
her
young
mistress
,
began
to
grow
quite
learned
herself
,
while
the
latter
,
softened
possibly
by
the
same
influences
,
would
lay
his
head
upon
the
window
-
ledge
,
and
placidly
open
and
shut
his
eyes
upon
the
street
,
all
through
a
summer
morning
;
sometimes
pricking
up
his
head
to
look
with
great
significance
after
some
noisy
dog
in
a
cart
,
who
was
barking
his
way
along
,
and
sometimes
,
with
an
exasperated
and
unaccountable
recollection
of
his
supposed
enemy
in
the
neighbourhood
,
rushing
to
the
door
,
whence
,
after
a
deafening
disturbance
,
he
would
come
jogging
back
with
a
ridiculous
complacency
that
belonged
to
him
,
and
lay
his
jaw
upon
the
window
-
ledge
again
,
with
the
air
of
a
dog
who
had
done
a
public
service
.
  
<EOS>
So
Florence
lived
in
her
wilderness
of
a
home
,
within
the
circle
of
her
innocent
pursuits
and
thoughts
,
and
nothing
harmed
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
go
down
to
her
father
's
rooms
now
,
and
think
of
him
,
and
suffer
her
loving
heart
humbly
to
approach
him
,
without
fear
of
repulse
.
<EOS>
She
could
look
upon
the
objects
that
had
surrounded
him
in
his
sorrow
,
and
could
nestle
near
his
chair
,
and
not
dread
the
glance
that
she
so
well
remembered
.
<EOS>
She
could
render
him
such
little
tokens
of
her
duty
and
service
,
as
putting
everything
in
order
for
him
with
her
own
hands
,
binding
little
nosegays
for
his
table
,
changing
them
as
one
by
one
they
withered
,
and
he
did
not
come
back
,
preparing
something
for
him
every
day
,
and
leaving
some
timid
mark
of
her
presence
near
his
usual
seat
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
,
it
was
a
little
painted
stand
for
his
watch
;
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
she
would
be
afraid
to
leave
it
,
and
would
substitute
some
other
trifle
of
her
making
not
so
likely
to
attract
his
eye
.
<EOS>
Waking
in
the
night
,
perhaps
,
she
would
tremble
at
the
thought
of
his
coming
home
and
angrily
rejecting
it
,
and
would
hurry
down
with
slippered
feet
and
quickly
beating
heart
,
and
bring
it
away
.
<EOS>
At
another
time
,
she
would
only
lay
her
face
upon
his
desk
,
and
leave
a
kiss
there
,
and
a
tear
.
  
<EOS>
Still
no
one
knew
of
this
.
<EOS>
Unless
the
household
found
it
out
when
she
was
not
there
---
and
they
all
held
Mr
Dombey
's
rooms
in
awe
---
it
was
as
deep
a
secret
in
her
breast
as
what
had
gone
before
it
.
<EOS>
Florence
stole
into
those
rooms
at
twilight
,
early
in
the
morning
,
and
at
times
when
meals
were
served
downstairs
.
<EOS>
And
although
they
were
in
every
nook
the
better
and
the
brighter
for
her
care
,
she
entered
and
passed
out
as
quietly
as
any
sunbeam
,
excepting
that
she
left
her
light
behind
.
  
<EOS>
Shadowy
company
attended
Florence
up
and
down
the
echoing
house
,
and
sat
with
her
in
the
dismantled
rooms
.
<EOS>
As
if
her
life
were
an
enchanted
vision
,
there
arose
out
of
her
solitude
ministering
thoughts
,
that
made
it
fanciful
and
unreal
.
<EOS>
She
imagined
so
often
what
her
life
would
have
been
if
her
father
could
have
loved
her
<EOS>
and
she
had
been
a
favourite
child
,
<EOS>
that
sometimes
,
for
the
moment
,
she
almost
believed
it
was
so
,
and
,
borne
on
by
the
current
of
that
pensive
fiction
,
seemed
to
remember
how
they
had
watched
her
brother
in
his
grave
together
;
how
they
had
freely
shared
his
heart
between
them
;
how
they
were
united
in
the
dear
remembrance
of
him
;
how
they
often
spoke
about
him
yet
;
and
her
kind
father
,
looking
at
her
gently
,
told
her
of
their
common
hope
and
trust
in
God
.
<EOS>
At
other
times
she
pictured
to
herself
her
mother
yet
alive
.
<EOS>
And
oh
the
happiness
of
falling
on
her
neck
,
and
clinging
to
her
with
the
love
and
confidence
of
all
her
soul
!
<EOS>
And
oh
the
desolation
of
the
solitary
house
again
,
with
evening
coming
on
,
and
no
one
there
!
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
one
thought
,
scarcely
shaped
out
to
herself
,
yet
fervent
and
strong
within
her
,
that
upheld
Florence
when
she
strove
,
and
filled
her
true
young
heart
,
so
sorely
tried
,
with
constancy
of
purpose
.
<EOS>
Into
her
mind
,
as
into
all
others
contending
with
the
great
affliction
of
our
mortal
nature
,
there
had
stolen
solemn
wonderings
and
hopes
,
arising
in
the
dim
world
beyond
the
present
life
,
and
murmuring
,
like
faint
music
,
of
recognition
in
the
far
-
off
land
between
her
brother
and
her
mother
:
of
some
present
consciousness
in
both
of
her
:
<EOS>
some
love
and
commiseration
for
her
:
and
some
knowledge
of
her
as
she
went
her
way
upon
the
earth
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
soothing
consolation
to
Florence
to
give
shelter
to
these
thoughts
,
until
one
day
<EOS>
---
it
was
soon
after
she
had
last
seen
her
father
in
his
own
room
,
late
at
night
---
the
fancy
came
upon
her
,
that
,
in
weeping
for
his
alienated
heart
,
she
might
stir
the
spirits
of
the
dead
against
him
.
<EOS>
Wild
,
weak
,
childish
,
as
it
may
have
been
to
think
so
,
and
to
tremble
at
the
half
-
formed
thought
,
it
was
the
impulse
of
her
loving
nature
;
and
from
that
hour
Florence
strove
against
the
cruel
wound
in
her
breast
,
and
tried
to
think
of
him
whose
hand
had
made
it
only
with
hope
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
did
not
know
---
she
held
to
it
from
that
time
---
how
much
she
loved
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
young
,
and
had
no
mother
,
and
had
never
learned
,
by
some
fault
or
misfortune
,
how
to
express
to
him
that
she
loved
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
patient
,
and
would
try
to
gain
that
art
in
time
,
and
win
him
to
a
better
knowledge
of
his
only
child
.
  
<EOS>
This
became
the
purpose
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
The
morning
sun
shone
down
upon
the
faded
house
,
and
found
the
resolution
bright
and
fresh
within
the
bosom
of
its
solitary
mistress
.
<EOS>
Through
all
the
duties
of
the
day
,
it
animated
her
;
for
Florence
hoped
that
the
more
she
knew
,
and
the
more
accomplished
she
became
,
the
more
glad
he
would
be
when
he
came
to
know
and
like
her
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
she
wondered
,
with
a
swelling
heart
and
rising
tear
,
whether
she
was
proficient
enough
in
anything
to
surprise
him
when
they
should
become
companions
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
she
tried
to
think
if
there
were
any
kind
of
knowledge
that
would
bespeak
his
interest
more
readily
than
another
.
<EOS>
Always
:
at
her
books
,
her
music
,
and
her
work
:
in
her
morning
walks
,
and
in
her
nightly
prayers
:
she
had
her
engrossing
aim
in
view
.
<EOS>
Strange
study
for
a
child
,
to
learn
the
road
to
a
hard
parent
's
heart
!
  
<EOS>
There
were
many
careless
loungers
through
the
street
,
as
the
summer
evening
deepened
into
night
,
who
glanced
across
the
road
at
the
sombre
house
,
and
saw
the
youthful
figure
at
the
window
,
such
a
contrast
to
it
,
looking
upward
at
the
stars
as
they
began
to
shine
,
who
would
have
slept
the
worse
if
they
had
known
on
what
design
she
mused
so
steadfastly
.
<EOS>
The
reputation
of
the
mansion
as
a
haunted
house
,
would
not
have
been
the
gayer
with
some
humble
dwellers
elsewhere
,
who
were
struck
by
its
external
gloom
in
passing
and
repassing
on
their
daily
avocations
,
and
so
named
it
,
if
they
could
have
read
its
story
in
the
darkening
face
.
<EOS>
But
Florence
held
her
sacred
purpose
,
unsuspected
and
unaided
:
and
studied
only
how
to
bring
her
father
to
the
understanding
that
she
loved
him
,
and
made
no
appeal
against
him
in
any
wandering
thought
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
Florence
lived
alone
in
the
deserted
house
,
and
day
succeeded
day
,
and
still
she
lived
alone
,
and
the
monotonous
walls
looked
down
upon
her
with
a
stare
,
as
if
they
had
a
Gorgon
-
like
intent
to
stare
her
youth
and
beauty
into
stone
.
  
<EOS>
Susan
Nipper
stood
opposite
to
her
young
mistress
one
morning
,
as
she
folded
and
sealed
a
note
she
had
been
writing
:
and
showed
in
her
looks
an
approving
knowledge
of
its
contents
.
  
<EOS>
"
Better
late
than
never
,
dear
Miss
Floy
,
"
said
Susan
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
do
say
,
that
even
a
visit
to
them
old
Skettleses
will
be
a
God
-
send
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
good
of
Sir
Barnet
and
Lady
Skettles
,
Susan
,
"
returned
Florence
,
with
a
mild
correction
of
that
young
lady
's
familiar
mention
of
the
family
in
question
,
"
to
repeat
their
invitation
so
kindly
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Nipper
,
who
was
perhaps
the
most
thoroughgoing
partisan
on
the
face
of
the
earth
,
and
who
carried
her
partisanship
into
all
matters
great
or
small
,
and
perpetually
waged
war
with
it
against
society
,
screwed
up
her
lips
and
shook
her
head
,
as
a
protest
against
any
recognition
of
disinterestedness
in
the
Skettleses
,
and
a
plea
in
bar
that
they
would
have
valuable
consideration
for
their
kindness
,
in
the
company
of
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
know
what
they
're
about
,
if
ever
people
did
,
"
murmured
Miss
Nipper
,
drawing
in
her
breath
,
"
oh
!
trust
them
Skettleses
for
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
very
anxious
to
go
to
Fulham
,
Susan
,
I
confess
,
"
said
Florence
thoughtfully
:
"
<EOS>
but
it
will
be
right
to
go
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
will
be
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Much
better
,
"
interposed
Susan
,
with
another
emphatic
shake
of
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
though
I
would
prefer
to
have
gone
when
there
was
no
one
there
,
instead
of
in
this
vacation
time
,
when
it
seems
there
are
some
young
people
staying
in
the
house
<EOS>
,
I
have
thankfully
said
yes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
For
which
I
say
,
<EOS>
Miss
Floy
,
Oh
be
joyful
!
"
returned
Susan
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
h
---

"
  
<EOS>
This
last
ejaculation
,
with
which
Miss
Nipper
frequently
wound
up
a
sentence
,
at
about
that
epoch
of
time
,
was
supposed
below
the
level
of
the
hall
to
have
a
general
reference
to
Mr
Dombey
,
and
to
be
expressive
of
a
yearning
in
Miss
Nipper
to
favour
that
gentleman
with
a
piece
of
her
mind
.
<EOS>
But
she
never
explained
it
;
and
it
had
,
in
consequence
,
the
charm
of
mystery
,
in
addition
to
the
advantage
of
the
sharpest
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
it
is
before
we
have
any
news
of
Walter
,
Susan
!
"
<EOS>
observed
Florence
,
after
a
moment
's
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Long
indeed
,
Miss
Floy
!
"
replied
her
maid
.
"
<EOS>
And
Perch
said
,
when
he
came
just
now
to
see
for
letters
---
but
what
signifies
what
he
says
!
"
exclaimed
Susan
,
reddening
and
breaking
off
.
"
<EOS>
Much
he
knows
about
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
raised
her
eyes
quickly
,
and
a
flush
overspread
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
n't
,
"
said
Susan
Nipper
,
evidently
struggling
with
some
latent
anxiety
and
alarm
,
and
looking
full
at
her
young
mistress
,
while
endeavouring
to
work
herself
into
a
state
of
resentment
with
the
unoffending
Mr
Perch
's
image
,
"
if
I
had
n't
more
manliness
than
that
insipidest
of
his
sex
,
I
'd
never
take
pride
in
my
hair
again
,
but
turn
it
up
behind
my
ears
,
and
wear
coarse
caps
,
without
a
bit
of
border
,
until
death
released
me
from
my
insignificance
.
<EOS>
I
may
not
be
a
Amazon
,
Miss
Floy
,
and
would
n't
so
demean
myself
by
such
disfigurement
,
but
anyways
I
'm
not
a
giver
up
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Give
up
!
<EOS>
What
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Florence
,
with
a
face
of
terror
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
nothing
,
Miss
,
"
said
Susan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
gracious
,
nothing!It
's
only
that
wet
curl
-
paper
of
a
man
Perch
,
that
any
one
might
almost
make
away
with
,
with
a
touch
,
and
really
it
would
be
a
blessed
event
for
all
parties
if
some
one
would
take
pity
on
him
,
and
would
have
the
goodness
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
he
give
up
the
ship
,
Susan
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Florence
,
very
pale
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Miss
,
"
returned
Susan
,
"
I
should
like
to
see
him
make
so
bold
as
do
it
to
my
face
!
<EOS>
No
,
Miss
,
but
he
goes
on
about
some
bothering
ginger
that
Mr
Walter
was
to
send
to
Mrs
Perch
,
and
shakes
his
dismal
head
,
and
says
he
hopes
it
may
be
coming
;
anyhow
,
he
says
,
it
ca
n't
come
now
in
time
for
the
intended
occasion
,
but
may
do
for
next
,
which
really
,
"
said
Miss
Nipper
,
with
aggravated
scorn
,
"
puts
me
out
of
patience
with
the
man
,
for
though
I
can
bear
a
great
deal
,
I
am
not
a
camel
,
neither
am
I
,
"
added
Susan
,
after
a
moment
's
consideration
,
"
if
I
know
myself
,
a
dromedary
neither
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
else
does
he
say
,
Susan
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Florence
,
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
tell
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
if
I
would
n't
tell
you
anything
,
Miss
Floy
,
and
everything
!
"
said
Susan
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Miss
,
he
says
that
there
begins
to
be
a
general
talk
about
the
ship
,
and
that
they
have
never
had
a
ship
on
that
voyage
half
so
long
unheard
of
,
and
that
the
Captain
's
wife
was
at
the
office
yesterday
,
and
seemed
a
little
put
out
about
it
,
but
any
one
could
say
that
,
we
knew
nearly
that
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
visit
Walter
's
uncle
,
"
said
Florence
,
hurriedly
,
"
before
I
leave
home
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
and
see
him
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Let
us
walk
there
,
directly
,
Susan
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Nipper
having
nothing
to
urge
against
the
proposal
,
but
being
perfectly
acquiescent
,
they
were
soon
equipped
,
and
in
the
streets
,
and
on
their
way
towards
the
little
Midshipman
.
  
<EOS>
The
state
of
mind
in
which
poor
Walter
had
gone
to
Captain
Cuttle
's
,
on
the
day
when
Brogley
the
broker
came
into
possession
,
and
when
there
seemed
to
him
to
be
an
execution
in
the
very
steeples
,
was
pretty
much
the
same
as
that
in
which
Florence
now
took
her
way
to
Uncle
Sol
's
;
with
this
difference
,
that
Florence
suffered
the
added
pain
of
thinking
that
she
had
been
,
perhaps
,
the
innocent
occasion
of
involving
Walter
in
peril
,
and
all
to
whom
he
was
dear
,
herself
included
,
in
an
agony
of
suspense
.
<EOS>
For
the
rest
,
uncertainty
and
danger
seemed
written
upon
everything
.
<EOS>
The
weathercocks
on
spires
and
housetops
were
mysterious
with
hints
of
stormy
wind
,
and
pointed
,
like
so
many
ghostly
fingers
,
out
to
dangerous
seas
,
where
fragments
of
great
wrecks
were
drifting
,
perhaps
,
and
helpless
men
were
rocked
upon
them
into
a
sleep
as
deep
as
the
unfathomable
waters
.
<EOS>
When
Florence
came
into
the
City
,
and
passed
gentlemen
who
were
talking
together
,
she
dreaded
to
hear
them
speaking
of
the
ship
,
and
saying
it
was
lost
.
<EOS>
Pictures
and
prints
of
vessels
fighting
with
the
rolling
waves
filled
her
with
alarm
.
<EOS>
The
smoke
and
clouds
,
though
moving
gently
,
moved
too
fast
for
her
apprehensions
,
and
made
her
fear
there
was
a
tempest
blowing
at
that
moment
on
the
ocean
.
  
<EOS>
Susan
Nipper
may
or
may
not
have
been
affected
similarly
,
but
having
her
attention
much
engaged
in
struggles
with
boys
,
whenever
there
was
any
press
of
people
---
for
,
between
that
grade
of
human
kind
and
herself
,
there
was
some
natural
animosity
that
invariably
broke
out
,
whenever
they
came
together
<EOS>
---
it
would
seem
that
she
had
not
much
leisure
on
the
road
for
intellectual
operations
.
  
<EOS>
Arriving
in
good
time
abreast
of
the
Wooden
Midshipman
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
,
and
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
cross
the
street
,
they
were
a
little
surprised
at
first
to
see
,
at
the
Instrument
-
maker
's
door
,
a
round
-
headed
lad
,
with
his
chubby
face
addressed
towards
the
sky
,
who
,
as
they
looked
at
him
,
suddenly
thrust
into
his
capacious
mouth
two
fingers
of
each
hand
,
and
with
the
assistance
of
that
machinery
whistled
,
with
astonishing
shrillness
,
to
some
pigeons
at
a
considerable
elevation
in
the
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Richards
's
eldest
,
Miss
!
"
said
Susan
,
"
and
the
worrit
of
Mrs
Richards
's
life
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
Polly
had
been
to
tell
Florence
of
the
resuscitated
prospects
of
her
son
and
heir
,
Florence
was
prepared
for
the
meeting
:
<EOS>
so
,
a
favourable
moment
presenting
itself
,
they
both
hastened
across
,
without
any
further
contemplation
of
Mrs
Richards
's
bane
.
<EOS>
That
sporting
character
,
unconscious
of
their
approach
,
again
whistled
with
his
utmost
might
,
and
then
yelled
in
a
rapture
of
excitement
,
"
Strays
!
<EOS>
Whoo
-
oop!Strays
!
"
which
identification
had
such
an
effect
upon
the
conscious
-
stricken
pigeons
,
that
instead
of
going
direct
to
some
town
in
the
North
of
England
,
as
appeared
to
have
been
their
original
intention
,
they
began
to
wheel
and
falter
;
whereupon
Mrs
Richards
's
firstborn
pierced
them
with
another
whistle
,
and
again
yelled
,
in
a
voice
that
rose
above
the
turmoil
of
the
street
,
"
Strays
!
<EOS>
Whoo
-
oop
!
<EOS>
Strays
!
"
  
<EOS>
From
this
transport
,
he
was
abruptly
recalled
to
terrestrial
objects
,
by
a
poke
from
Miss
Nipper
,
which
sent
him
into
the
shop
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
this
the
way
you
show
your
penitence
,
when
Mrs
Richards
has
been
fretting
for
you
months
and
months
?
"
said
Susan
,
following
the
poke
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
's
Mr
Gills
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Rob
,
who
smoothed
his
first
rebellious
glance
at
Miss
Nipper
when
he
saw
Florence
following
,
put
his
knuckles
to
his
hair
,
in
honour
of
the
latter
,
and
said
to
the
former
,
that
Mr
Gills
was
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fetch
him
home
,
"
said
Miss
Nipper
,
with
authority
,
"
and
say
that
my
young
lady
's
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
where
he
's
gone
,
"
said
Rob
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
your
penitence
?
"
cried
Susan
,
with
stinging
sharpness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
how
can
I
go
and
fetch
him
when
I
do
n't
know
where
to
go
?
<EOS>
"
whimpered
the
baited
Rob
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
be
so
unreasonable
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
Mr
Gills
say
when
he
should
be
home
?
"
asked
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Miss
,
"
replied
Rob
,
with
another
application
of
his
knuckles
to
his
hair
.
"
<EOS>
He
said
he
should
be
home
early
in
the
afternoon
;
in
about
a
couple
of
hours
from
now
,
<EOS>
Miss.
"
  
"
Is
he
very
anxious
about
his
nephew
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Susan
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Miss
,
"
returned
Rob
,
preferring
to
address
himself
to
Florence
and
slighting
Nipper
;
"
I
should
say
he
was
very
much
so
.
<EOS>
He
ai
n't
indoors
,
Miss
,
not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
together
.
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
settle
in
one
place
five
minutes
.
<EOS>
He
goes
about
,
like
a
---
just
like
a
stray
,
"
said
Rob
,
stooping
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
pigeons
through
the
window
,
and
checking
himself
,
with
his
fingers
half
-
way
to
his
mouth
,
on
the
verge
of
another
whistle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
a
friend
of
Mr
Gills
,
called
Captain
Cuttle
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Florence
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
"
Him
with
a
hook
,
Miss
?
"
rejoined
Rob
,
with
an
illustrative
twist
of
his
left
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
<EOS>
Miss.
He
was
here
the
day
before
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Has
he
not
been
here
since
?
"
asked
Susan
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Miss
,
"
returned
Rob
,
still
addressing
his
reply
to
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
Walter
's
uncle
has
gone
there
,
Susan
,
"
observed
Florence
,
turning
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
Captain
Cuttle
's
,
Miss
?
"
interposed
Rob
;
"
no
,
he
's
not
gone
there
,
<EOS>
Miss.
Because
he
left
particular
word
that
if
Captain
Cuttle
called
,
I
should
tell
him
how
surprised
he
was
,
not
to
have
seen
him
yesterday
,
and
should
make
him
stop
till
he
came
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
where
Captain
Cuttle
lives
?
"
asked
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
Rob
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
and
turning
to
a
greasy
parchment
book
on
the
shop
desk
,
read
the
address
aloud
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
again
turned
to
her
maid
and
took
counsel
with
her
in
a
low
voice
,
while
Rob
the
round
-
eyed
,
mindful
of
his
patron
's
secret
charge
,
looked
on
and
listened
.
<EOS>
Florence
proposed
that
they
should
go
to
Captain
Cuttle
's
house
;
hear
from
his
own
lips
,
what
he
thought
of
the
absence
of
any
tidings
of
the
Son
and
Heir
;
and
bring
him
,
if
they
could
,
to
comfort
Uncle
Sol
.
<EOS>
Susan
at
first
objected
slightly
,
on
the
score
of
distance
;
but
a
hackney
-
coach
being
mentioned
by
her
mistress
,
withdrew
that
opposition
,
and
gave
in
her
assent
.
<EOS>
There
were
some
minutes
of
discussion
between
them
before
they
came
to
this
conclusion
,
during
which
the
staring
Rob
paid
close
attention
to
both
speakers
,
and
inclined
his
ear
to
each
by
turns
,
as
if
he
were
appointed
arbitrator
of
the
arguments
.
  
<EOS>
In
fine
,
Rob
was
despatched
for
a
coach
,
the
visitors
keeping
shop
meanwhile
;
and
when
he
brought
it
,
they
got
into
it
,
leaving
word
for
Uncle
Sol
that
they
would
be
sure
to
call
again
,
on
their
way
back
.
<EOS>
Rob
having
stared
after
the
coach
until
it
was
as
invisible
as
the
pigeons
had
now
become
,
sat
down
behind
the
desk
with
a
most
assiduous
demeanour
;
and
in
order
that
he
might
forget
nothing
of
what
had
transpired
,
made
notes
of
it
on
various
small
scraps
of
paper
,
with
a
vast
expenditure
of
ink
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
danger
of
these
documents
betraying
anything
,
if
accidentally
lost
;
for
long
before
a
word
was
dry
,
it
became
as
profound
a
mystery
to
Rob
,
as
if
he
had
had
no
part
whatever
in
its
production
.
  
<EOS>
While
he
was
yet
busy
with
these
labours
,
the
hackney
-
coach
,
after
encountering
unheard
-
of
difficulties
from
swivel
-
bridges
,
soft
roads
,
impassable
canals
,
caravans
of
casks
,
settlements
of
scarlet
-
beans
and
little
wash
-
houses
,
and
many
such
obstacles
abounding
in
that
country
,
stopped
at
the
corner
of
Brig
Place
.
<EOS>
Alighting
here
,
Florence
and
Susan
Nipper
walked
down
the
street
,
and
sought
out
the
abode
of
Captain
Cuttle
.
  
<EOS>
It
happened
by
evil
chance
to
be
one
of
Mrs
MacStinger
's
great
cleaning
days
.
<EOS>
On
these
occasions
,
Mrs
MacStinger
was
knocked
up
by
the
policeman
at
a
quarter
before
three
in
the
morning
,
and
rarely
succumbed
before
twelve
o'clock
next
night
.
<EOS>
The
chief
object
of
this
institution
appeared
to
be
,
that
Mrs
MacStinger
should
move
all
the
furniture
into
the
back
garden
at
early
dawn
,
walk
about
the
house
in
pattens
all
day
,
and
move
the
furniture
back
again
after
dark
.
<EOS>
These
ceremonies
greatly
fluttered
those
doves
the
young
MacStingers
,
who
were
not
only
unable
at
such
times
to
find
any
resting
-
place
for
the
soles
of
their
feet
,
but
generally
came
in
for
a
good
deal
of
pecking
from
the
maternal
bird
during
the
progress
of
the
solemnities
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
moment
when
Florence
and
Susan
Nipper
presented
themselves
at
Mrs
MacStinger
's
door
,
that
worthy
but
redoubtable
female
was
in
the
act
of
conveying
Alexander
MacStinger
,
aged
two
years
and
three
months
,
along
the
passage
for
forcible
deposition
in
a
sitting
posture
on
the
street
pavement
;
Alexander
being
black
in
the
face
with
holding
his
breath
after
punishment
,
and
a
cool
paving
-
stone
being
usually
found
to
act
as
a
powerful
restorative
in
such
cases
.
  
<EOS>
The
feelings
of
Mrs
MacStinger
,
as
a
woman
and
a
mother
,
were
outraged
by
the
look
of
pity
for
Alexander
which
she
observed
on
Florence
's
face
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
Mrs
MacStinger
asserting
those
finest
emotions
of
our
nature
,
in
preference
to
weakly
gratifying
her
curiosity
,
shook
and
buffeted
Alexander
both
before
and
during
the
application
of
the
paving
-
stone
,
and
took
no
further
notice
of
the
strangers
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Florence
,
when
the
child
had
found
his
breath
again
,
and
was
using
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
this
Captain
Cuttle
's
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mrs
MacStinger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
Number
Nine
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Florence
,
hesitating
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
said
it
was
n't
Number
Nine
?
"
said
Mrs
MacStinger
.
  
<EOS>
Susan
Nipper
instantly
struck
in
,
and
begged
to
inquire
what
Mrs
MacStinger
meant
by
that
,
and
if
she
knew
whom
she
was
talking
to
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
MacStinger
in
retort
,
looked
at
her
all
over
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
with
Captain
Cuttle
,
I
should
wish
to
know
?
"
said
Mrs
MacStinger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Should
you
?
<EOS>
Then
I
'm
sorry
that
you
wo
n't
be
satisfied
,
"
returned
Miss
Nipper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
Susan
!
<EOS>
If
you
please
!
"
said
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
can
have
the
goodness
to
tell
us
where
Captain
Cuttle
lives
,
ma'am
,
as
he
do
n't
live
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
says
he
do
n't
live
here
?
"
retorted
the
implacable
MacStinger
.
<EOS>
"
I
said
it
was
n't
Cap'en
Cuttle
's
house
---
<EOS>
and
it
ai
n't
his
house
---
and
forbid
it
,
that
it
ever
should
be
his
house
---
for
Cap'en
Cuttle
do
n't
know
how
to
keep
a
house
---
and
do
n't
deserve
to
have
a
house
<EOS>
---
it
's
my
house
---
and
when
I
let
the
upper
floor
to
Cap'en
Cuttle
,
oh
I
do
a
thankless
thing
,
and
cast
pearls
before
swine
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
MacStinger
pitched
her
voice
for
the
upper
windows
in
offering
these
remarks
,
and
cracked
off
each
clause
sharply
by
itself
as
if
from
a
rifle
possessing
an
infinity
of
barrels
.
<EOS>
After
the
last
shot
,
the
Captain
's
voice
was
heard
to
say
,
in
feeble
remonstrance
from
his
own
room
,
"
Steady
below
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Since
you
want
Cap'en
Cuttle
,
there
he
is
!
"
said
Mrs
MacStinger
,
with
an
angry
motion
of
her
hand
.
<EOS>
On
Florence
making
bold
to
enter
,
without
any
more
parley
,
and
on
Susan
following
,
Mrs
MacStinger
recommenced
her
pedestrian
exercise
in
pattens
,
and
Alexander
MacStinger
(
still
on
the
paving
-
stone
)
,
who
had
stopped
in
his
crying
to
attend
to
the
conversation
,
began
to
wail
again
,
entertaining
himself
during
that
dismal
performance
,
which
was
quite
mechanical
,
with
a
general
survey
of
the
prospect
,
terminating
in
the
hackney
-
coach
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
in
his
own
apartment
was
sitting
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
legs
drawn
up
under
his
chair
,
on
a
very
small
desolate
island
,
lying
about
midway
in
an
ocean
of
soap
and
water
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
's
windows
had
been
cleaned
,
the
walls
had
been
cleaned
,
the
stove
had
been
cleaned
,
and
everything
,
the
stove
excepted
,
was
wet
,
and
shining
with
soft
soap
and
sand
:
the
smell
of
which
dry
-
saltery
impregnated
the
air
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
dreary
scene
,
the
Captain
,
cast
away
upon
his
island
,
looked
round
on
the
waste
of
waters
with
a
rueful
countenance
,
and
seemed
waiting
for
some
friendly
bark
to
come
that
way
,
and
take
him
off
.
   
<EOS>
But
when
the
Captain
,
directing
his
forlorn
visage
towards
the
door
,
saw
Florence
appear
with
her
maid
,
no
words
can
describe
his
astonishment
.
<EOS>
Mrs
MacStinger
's
eloquence
having
rendered
all
other
sounds
but
imperfectly
distinguishable
,
he
had
looked
for
no
rarer
visitor
than
the
potboy
or
the
milkman
;
wherefore
,
when
Florence
appeared
,
and
coming
to
the
confines
of
the
island
,
put
her
hand
in
his
,
the
Captain
stood
up
,
aghast
,
as
if
he
supposed
her
,
for
the
moment
,
to
be
some
young
member
of
the
Flying
Dutchman
's
family
.
  
<EOS>
Instantly
recovering
his
self
-
possession
,
however
,
the
Captain
's
first
care
was
to
place
her
on
dry
land
,
which
he
happily
accomplished
,
with
one
motion
of
his
arm
.
<EOS>
Issuing
forth
,
then
,
upon
the
main
,
Captain
Cuttle
took
Miss
Nipper
round
the
waist
,
and
bore
her
to
the
island
also
.
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
then
,
with
great
respect
and
admiration
,
raised
the
hand
of
Florence
to
his
lips
,
and
standing
off
a
little
(
for
the
island
was
not
large
enough
for
three
)
,
beamed
on
her
from
the
soap
and
water
like
a
new
description
of
Triton
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
amazed
to
see
us
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Florence
,
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
The
inexpressibly
gratified
Captain
kissed
his
hook
in
reply
,
and
growled
,
as
if
a
choice
and
delicate
compliment
were
included
in
the
words
,
"
Stand
by
!
<EOS>
Stand
by
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
could
n't
rest
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
without
coming
to
ask
you
what
you
think
about
dear
Walter
---
who
is
my
brother
now
---
and
whether
there
is
anything
to
fear
,
and
whether
you
will
not
go
and
console
his
poor
uncle
every
day
,
until
we
have
some
intelligence
of
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
these
words
Captain
Cuttle
,
as
by
an
involuntary
gesture
,
clapped
his
hand
to
his
head
,
on
which
the
hard
glazed
hat
was
not
,
and
looked
discomfited
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
fears
for
Walter
's
safety
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Florence
,
from
whose
face
the
Captain
(
so
enraptured
he
was
with
it
)
could
not
take
his
eyes
:
while
she
,
in
her
turn
,
looked
earnestly
at
him
,
to
be
assured
of
the
sincerity
of
his
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Heart's
-
delight
,
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
I
am
not
afeard
.
<EOS>
Wal'r
is
a
lad
<EOS>
as'll
go
through
a
deal
o
'
hard
weather
.
<EOS>
Wal'r
is
a
lad
<EOS>
as'll
bring
as
much
success
to
that
'
ere
brig
as
a
lad
<EOS>
is
capable
on
.
<EOS>
Wal'r
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
his
eyes
glistening
with
the
praise
of
his
young
friend
,
and
his
hook
raised
to
announce
a
beautiful
quotation
,
"
is
what
you
may
call
a
out'ard
and
visible
sign
of
an
in'ard
and
spirited
grasp
,
and
when
found
make
a
note
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
,
who
did
not
quite
understand
this
,
though
the
Captain
evidently
thought
it
full
of
meaning
,
and
highly
satisfactory
,
mildly
looked
to
him
for
something
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
afeard
,
my
Heart's
-
delight
,
"
resumed
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
been
most
uncommon
bad
weather
in
them
latitudes
,
there
's
no
denyin
'
,
and
they
have
drove
and
drove
and
been
beat
off
,
may
be
t'other
side
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
the
ship
's
a
good
ship
,
and
the
lad
's
a
good
lad
;
and
it
ai
n't
easy
,
<EOS>
thank
the
Lord
,
"
the
Captain
made
a
little
bow
,
"
to
break
up
hearts
of
oak
,
whether
they
're
in
brigs
or
buzzums
.
<EOS>
Here
we
have
'em
both
ways
,
which
is
bringing
it
up
with
a
round
turn
,
and
so
I
ai
n't
a
bit
afeard
as
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
As
yet
?
"
repeated
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
,
"
returned
the
Captain
,
kissing
his
iron
hand
;
"
and
afore
I
begin
to
be
,
my
Heart's
-
delight
,
Wal'r
will
have
wrote
home
from
the
island
,
or
from
some
port
or
another
,
and
made
all
taut
and
ship
-
shape
.
<EOS>
And
with
regard
to
old
Sol
Gills
,
"
here
the
Captain
became
solemn
,
"
who
I
'll
stand
by
,
and
not
desert
until
death
doe
us
part
,
and
when
the
stormy
winds
do
blow
,
do
blow
,
do
blow
---
overhaul
the
Catechism
,
"
said
the
Captain
parenthetically
,
"
and
there
you
'll
find
them
expressions
---
if
it
would
console
Sol
Gills
to
have
the
opinion
of
a
seafaring
man
as
has
got
a
mind
equal
to
any
undertaking
that
he
puts
it
alongside
of
,
and
as
was
all
but
smashed
in
his
'
prenticeship
,
and
of
which
the
name
is
Bunsby
,
that
'
ere
man
shall
give
him
such
an
opinion
in
his
own
parlour
<EOS>
as'll
stun
him
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
,
vauntingly
,
"
as
much
as
if
he
'd
gone
and
knocked
his
head
again
a
door
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
take
this
gentleman
to
see
him
,
and
let
us
hear
what
he
says
,
"
cried
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
go
with
us
now
?
<EOS>
We
have
a
coach
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Again
the
Captain
clapped
his
hand
to
his
head
,
on
which
the
hard
glazed
hat
was
not
,
and
looked
discomfited
.
<EOS>
But
at
this
instant
a
most
remarkable
phenomenon
occurred
.
<EOS>
The
door
opening
,
without
any
note
of
preparation
,
and
apparently
of
itself
,
the
hard
glazed
hat
in
question
skimmed
into
the
room
like
a
bird
,
and
alighted
heavily
at
the
Captain
's
feet
.
<EOS>
The
door
then
shut
as
violently
as
it
had
opened
,
and
nothing
ensued
in
explanation
of
the
prodigy
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
picked
up
his
hat
,
and
having
turned
it
over
with
a
look
of
interest
and
welcome
,
began
to
polish
it
on
his
sleeve
.
<EOS>
While
doing
so
,
the
Captain
eyed
his
visitors
intently
,
and
said
in
a
low
voice
:
  
"
<EOS>
You
see
I
should
have
bore
down
on
Sol
Gills
yesterday
,
and
this
morning
,
but
she
<EOS>
---
she
took
it
away
and
kep
it
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
long
and
short
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
did
,
for
goodness
sake
?
"
asked
Susan
Nipper
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
lady
of
the
house
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
the
Captain
,
in
a
gruff
whisper
,
and
making
signals
of
secrecy
.
<EOS>
"
We
had
some
words
about
the
swabbing
of
these
here
planks
,
and
she
---
in
short
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
eyeing
the
door
,
and
relieving
himself
with
a
long
breath
,
"
she
stopped
my
liberty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
wish
she
had
me
to
deal
with
!
"
said
Susan
,
reddening
with
the
energy
of
the
wish
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
stop
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
,
do
you
think
,
my
dear
?
"
rejoined
the
Captain
,
shaking
his
head
doubtfully
,
but
regarding
the
desperate
courage
of
the
fair
aspirant
with
obvious
admiration
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
It
's
difficult
navigation
.
<EOS>
She
's
very
hard
to
carry
on
with
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
You
never
can
tell
how
she
'll
head
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
She
's
full
one
minute
,
and
round
upon
you
next
.
<EOS>
And
when
she
is
a
tartar
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
with
the
perspiration
breaking
out
upon
his
forehead
---
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
but
a
whistle
emphatic
enough
for
the
conclusion
of
the
sentence
,
so
the
Captain
whistled
tremulously
.
<EOS>
After
which
he
again
shook
his
head
,
and
recurring
to
his
admiration
of
Miss
Nipper
's
devoted
bravery
,
timidly
repeated
,
"
Would
you
,
do
you
think
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Susan
only
replied
with
a
bridling
smile
,
but
that
was
so
very
full
of
defiance
,
that
there
is
no
knowing
how
long
Captain
Cuttle
might
have
stood
entranced
in
its
contemplation
,
if
Florence
in
her
anxiety
had
not
again
proposed
their
immediately
resorting
to
the
oracular
Bunsby
.
<EOS>
Thus
reminded
of
his
duty
,
Captain
Cuttle
put
on
the
glazed
hat
firmly
,
took
up
another
knobby
stick
,
with
which
he
had
supplied
the
place
of
that
one
given
to
Walter
,
and
offering
his
arm
to
Florence
,
prepared
to
cut
his
way
through
the
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
It
turned
out
,
however
,
that
Mrs
MacStinger
had
already
changed
her
course
,
and
that
she
headed
,
as
the
Captain
had
remarked
she
often
did
,
in
quite
a
new
direction
.
<EOS>
For
when
they
got
downstairs
,
they
found
that
exemplary
woman
beating
the
mats
on
the
doorsteps
,
with
Alexander
,
still
upon
the
paving
-
stone
,
dimly
looming
through
a
fog
of
dust
;
and
so
absorbed
was
Mrs
MacStinger
in
her
household
occupation
,
that
when
Captain
Cuttle
and
his
visitors
passed
,
she
beat
the
harder
,
and
neither
by
word
nor
gesture
showed
any
consciousness
of
their
vicinity
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
was
so
well
pleased
with
this
easy
escape
---
although
the
effect
of
the
door
-
mats
on
him
was
like
a
copious
administration
of
snuff
,
and
made
him
sneeze
until
the
tears
ran
down
his
face
---
that
he
could
hardly
believe
his
good
fortune
;
but
more
than
once
,
between
the
door
and
the
hackney
-
coach
,
looked
over
his
shoulder
,
with
an
obvious
apprehension
of
Mrs
MacStinger
's
giving
chase
yet
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
they
got
to
the
corner
of
Brig
Place
without
any
molestation
from
that
terrible
fire
-
ship
;
and
the
Captain
mounting
the
coach
-
box
---
for
his
gallantry
would
not
allow
him
to
ride
inside
with
the
ladies
,
though
besought
to
do
so
<EOS>
---
piloted
the
driver
on
his
course
for
Captain
Bunsby
's
vessel
,
which
was
called
the
Cautious
Clara
,
and
was
lying
hard
by
Ratcliffe
.
  
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
wharf
off
which
this
great
commander
's
ship
was
jammed
in
among
some
five
hundred
companions
,
whose
tangled
rigging
looked
like
monstrous
cobwebs
half
swept
down
,
Captain
Cuttle
appeared
at
the
coach
-
window
,
and
invited
Florence
and
Miss
Nipper
to
accompany
him
on
board
;
observing
that
Bunsby
was
to
the
last
degree
soft
-
hearted
in
respect
of
ladies
,
and
that
nothing
would
so
much
tend
to
bring
his
expansive
intellect
into
a
state
of
harmony
as
their
presentation
to
the
Cautious
Clara
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
readily
consented
;
and
the
Captain
,
taking
her
little
hand
in
his
prodigious
palm
,
led
her
,
with
a
mixed
expression
of
patronage
,
paternity
,
pride
,
and
ceremony
,
that
was
pleasant
to
see
,
over
several
very
dirty
decks
,
until
,
coming
to
the
Clara
,
they
found
that
cautious
craft
(
which
lay
outside
the
tier
)
with
her
gangway
removed
,
and
half
-
a
-
dozen
feet
of
river
interposed
between
herself
and
her
nearest
neighbour
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
,
from
Captain
Cuttle
's
explanation
,
that
the
great
Bunsby
,
like
himself
,
was
cruelly
treated
by
his
landlady
,
and
that
when
her
usage
of
him
for
the
time
being
was
so
hard
that
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
,
he
set
this
gulf
between
them
as
a
last
resource
.
  
<EOS>
"
Clara
a
-
hoy
!
"
cried
the
Captain
,
putting
a
hand
to
each
side
of
his
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
-
hoy
!
"
cried
a
boy
,
like
the
Captain
's
echo
,
tumbling
up
from
below
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bunsby
aboard
?
"
cried
the
Captain
,
hailing
the
boy
in
a
stentorian
voice
,
as
if
he
were
half
-
a
-
mile
off
instead
of
two
yards
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
!
"
cried
the
boy
,
in
the
same
tone
.
  
<EOS>
The
boy
then
shoved
out
a
plank
to
Captain
Cuttle
,
who
adjusted
it
carefully
,
and
led
Florence
across
:
returning
presently
for
Miss
Nipper
.
<EOS>
So
they
stood
upon
the
deck
of
the
Cautious
Clara
,
in
whose
standing
rigging
,
divers
fluttering
articles
of
dress
were
curing
,
in
company
with
a
few
tongues
and
some
mackerel
.
  
<EOS>
Immediately
there
appeared
,
coming
slowly
up
above
the
bulk
-
head
of
the
cabin
,
another
bulk
-
head
---
human
,
and
very
large
---
with
one
stationary
eye
in
the
mahogany
face
,
and
one
revolving
one
,
on
the
principle
of
some
lighthouses
.
<EOS>
This
head
was
decorated
with
shaggy
hair
,
like
oakum
,
which
had
no
governing
inclination
towards
the
north
,
east
,
west
,
or
south
,
but
inclined
to
all
four
quarters
of
the
compass
,
and
to
every
point
upon
it
.
<EOS>
The
head
was
followed
by
a
perfect
desert
of
chin
,
and
by
a
shirt
-
collar
and
neckerchief
,
and
by
a
dreadnought
pilot
-
coat
,
and
by
a
pair
of
dreadnought
pilot
-
trousers
,
whereof
the
waistband
was
so
very
broad
and
high
,
that
it
became
a
succedaneum
for
a
waistcoat
:
being
ornamented
near
the
wearer
's
breast
-
bone
with
some
massive
wooden
buttons
,
like
backgammon
men
.
<EOS>
As
the
lower
portions
of
these
pantaloons
became
revealed
,
Bunsby
stood
confessed
;
his
hands
in
their
pockets
,
which
were
of
vast
size
;
and
his
gaze
directed
,
not
to
Captain
Cuttle
or
the
ladies
,
but
the
mast
-
head
.
  
<EOS>
The
profound
appearance
of
this
philosopher
,
who
was
bulky
and
strong
,
and
on
whose
extremely
red
face
an
expression
of
taciturnity
sat
enthroned
,
not
inconsistent
with
his
character
,
in
which
that
quality
was
proudly
conspicuous
,
almost
daunted
Captain
Cuttle
,
though
on
familiar
terms
with
him
.
<EOS>
Whispering
to
Florence
that
Bunsby
had
never
in
his
life
expressed
surprise
,
and
was
considered
not
to
know
what
it
meant
,
the
Captain
watched
him
as
he
eyed
his
mast
-
head
,
and
afterwards
swept
the
horizon
;
and
when
the
revolving
eye
seemed
to
be
coming
round
in
his
direction
,
said
:
  
"
Bunsby
,
my
lad
<EOS>
,
how
fares
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
deep
,
gruff
,
husky
utterance
,
which
seemed
to
have
no
connexion
with
Bunsby
,
and
certainly
had
not
the
least
effect
upon
his
face
,
replied
,
"
Aye
,
aye
,
shipmet
<EOS>
,
how
goes
it
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
Bunsby
's
right
hand
and
arm
,
emerging
from
a
pocket
,
shook
the
Captain
's
,
and
went
back
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bunsby
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
striking
home
at
once
,
"
here
you
are
;
a
man
of
mind
,
and
a
man
as
can
give
as
opinion
.
<EOS>
Here
's
a
young
lady
as
wants
to
take
that
opinion
,
in
regard
of
my
friend
Wal'r
;
likewise
my
t'other
friend
,
Sol
Gills
,
which
is
a
character
for
you
to
come
within
hail
of
,
<EOS>
being
a
man
of
science
,
which
is
the
mother
of
inwention
,
and
knows
no
law
.
<EOS>
Bunsby
,
will
you
wear
,
to
oblige
me
,
and
come
along
with
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
great
commander
,
who
seemed
by
the
expression
of
his
visage
to
be
always
on
the
look
-
out
for
something
in
the
extremest
distance
,
and
to
have
no
ocular
knowledge
of
anything
within
ten
miles
,
made
no
reply
whatever
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
is
a
man
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
addressing
himself
to
his
fair
auditors
,
and
indicating
the
commander
with
his
outstretched
hook
,
"
that
has
fell
down
more
than
any
man
alive
;
that
has
had
more
accidents
happen
to
his
own
self
than
the
Seamen
's
Hospital
to
all
hands
;
that
took
as
many
spars
and
bars
and
bolts
about
the
outside
of
his
head
when
he
was
young
,
as
you
'd
want
a
order
for
on
Chatham
-
yard
to
build
a
pleasure
-
yacht
with
;
and
yet
that
got
his
opinions
in
that
way
<EOS>
,
it
's
my
belief
,
for
there
an't
<EOS>
nothing
like
'em
afloat
or
ashore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
stolid
commander
appeared
,
by
a
very
slight
vibration
in
his
elbows
,
to
express
some
satisfaction
in
this
encomium
;
but
if
his
face
had
been
as
distant
as
his
gaze
was
,
it
could
hardly
have
enlightened
the
beholders
less
in
reference
to
anything
that
was
passing
in
his
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shipmet
,
"
said
Bunsby
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
and
stooping
down
to
look
out
under
some
interposing
spar
,
"
what
'll
the
ladies
drink
?
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
whose
delicacy
was
shocked
by
such
an
inquiry
in
connection
with
Florence
,
drew
the
sage
aside
,
and
seeming
to
explain
in
his
ear
,
accompanied
him
below
;
where
,
that
he
might
not
take
offence
,
the
Captain
drank
a
dram
himself
,
which
Florence
and
Susan
,
glancing
down
the
open
skylight
,
saw
the
sage
,
with
difficulty
finding
room
for
himself
between
his
berth
and
a
very
little
brass
fireplace
,
serve
out
for
self
and
friend
.
<EOS>
They
soon
reappeared
on
deck
,
and
Captain
Cuttle
,
triumphing
in
the
success
of
his
enterprise
,
conducted
Florence
back
to
the
coach
,
while
Bunsby
followed
,
escorting
Miss
Nipper
,
whom
he
hugged
upon
the
way
(
much
to
that
young
lady
's
indignation
)
with
his
pilot
-
coated
arm
,
like
a
blue
bear
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
put
his
oracle
inside
,
and
gloried
so
much
in
having
secured
him
,
and
having
got
that
mind
into
a
hackney
-
coach
,
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
often
peeping
in
at
Florence
through
the
little
window
behind
the
driver
,
and
testifying
his
delight
in
smiles
,
and
also
in
taps
upon
his
forehead
,
to
hint
to
her
that
the
brain
of
Bunsby
was
hard
at
it
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
Bunsby
,
still
hugging
Miss
Nipper
(
for
his
friend
,
the
Captain
,
had
not
exaggerated
the
softness
of
his
heart
)
,
uniformly
preserved
his
gravity
of
deportment
,
and
showed
no
other
consciousness
of
her
or
anything
.
  
<EOS>
Uncle
Sol
,
who
had
come
home
,
received
them
at
the
door
,
and
ushered
them
immediately
into
the
little
back
parlour
:
strangely
altered
by
the
absence
of
Walter
.
<EOS>
On
the
table
,
and
about
the
room
,
were
the
charts
and
maps
on
which
the
heavy
-
hearted
Instrument
-
maker
had
again
and
again
tracked
the
missing
vessel
across
the
sea
,
and
on
which
,
with
a
pair
of
compasses
that
he
still
had
in
his
hand
,
he
had
been
measuring
,
a
minute
before
,
how
far
she
must
have
driven
,
to
have
driven
here
or
there
:
and
trying
to
demonstrate
that
a
long
time
must
elapse
before
hope
was
exhausted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whether
she
can
have
run
,
"
said
Uncle
Sol
,
looking
wistfully
over
the
chart
;
"
but
no
,
that
's
almost
impossible
.
<EOS>
Or
whether
she
can
have
been
forced
by
stress
of
weather
,
---
but
that
's
not
reasonably
likely
.
<EOS>
Or
whether
there
is
any
hope
she
so
far
changed
her
course
as
---
but
even
I
can
hardly
hope
that
!
"
<EOS>
With
such
broken
suggestions
,
poor
old
Uncle
Sol
roamed
over
the
great
sheet
before
him
,
and
could
not
find
a
speck
of
hopeful
probability
in
it
large
enough
to
set
one
small
point
of
the
compasses
upon
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
saw
immediately
---
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
help
seeing
---
that
there
was
a
singular
indescribable
change
in
the
old
man
,
and
that
while
his
manner
was
far
more
restless
and
unsettled
than
usual
,
there
was
yet
a
curious
,
contradictory
decision
in
it
,
that
perplexed
her
very
much
.
<EOS>
She
fancied
once
that
he
spoke
wildly
,
and
at
random
;
for
on
her
saying
she
regretted
not
to
have
seen
him
when
she
had
been
there
before
that
morning
,
he
at
first
replied
that
he
had
been
to
see
her
,
and
directly
afterwards
seemed
to
wish
to
recall
that
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
to
see
me
?
"
said
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
-
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
young
lady
,
"
returned
Uncle
Sol
,
looking
at
her
and
away
from
her
in
a
confused
manner
.
<EOS>
"
I
wished
to
see
you
with
my
own
eyes
,
and
to
hear
you
with
my
own
ears
,
once
more
before
---
"
There
he
stopped
.
  
<EOS>
"
Before
when
?
<EOS>
Before
what
?
"
said
Florence
,
putting
her
hand
upon
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
say
"
before
?
"
<EOS>
"
replied
old
Sol
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
did
,
I
must
have
meant
before
we
should
have
news
of
my
dear
boy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
well
,
"
said
Florence
,
tenderly
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
so
very
anxious
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
are
not
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
as
well
,
"
returned
the
old
man
,
shutting
up
his
right
hand
,
and
holding
it
out
to
show
her
:
"
as
well
and
firm
as
any
man
at
my
time
of
life
can
hope
to
be
.
<EOS>
See
!
<EOS>
It
's
steady
.
<EOS>
Is
its
master
not
as
capable
of
resolution
and
fortitude
as
many
a
younger
man
?
<EOS>
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
We
shall
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
that
in
his
manner
more
than
in
his
words
,
though
they
remained
with
her
too
,
which
impressed
Florence
so
much
,
that
she
would
have
confided
her
uneasiness
to
Captain
Cuttle
at
that
moment
,
if
the
Captain
had
not
seized
that
moment
for
expounding
the
state
of
circumstances
on
which
the
opinion
of
the
sagacious
Bunsby
was
requested
,
and
entreating
that
profound
authority
to
deliver
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
Bunsby
,
whose
eye
continued
to
be
addressed
to
somewhere
about
the
half
-
way
house
between
London
and
Gravesend
,
two
or
three
times
put
out
his
rough
right
arm
,
as
seeking
to
wind
it
for
inspiration
round
the
fair
form
of
Miss
Nipper
;
but
that
young
female
having
withdrawn
herself
,
in
displeasure
,
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
,
the
soft
heart
of
the
Commander
of
the
Cautious
Clara
met
with
no
response
to
its
impulses
.
<EOS>
After
sundry
failures
in
this
wise
,
the
Commander
,
addressing
himself
to
nobody
,
thus
spake
;
or
rather
the
voice
within
him
said
of
its
own
accord
,
and
quite
independent
of
himself
,
as
if
he
were
possessed
by
a
gruff
spirit
:
  
"
My
name
's
Jack
Bunsby
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
christened
John
,
"
cried
the
delighted
Captain
Cuttle
.
"
<EOS>
Hear
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
I
says
,
"
pursued
the
voice
,
after
some
deliberation
,
"
I
stands
to
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
with
Florence
on
his
arm
,
nodded
at
the
auditory
,
and
seemed
to
say
,
"
Now
he
's
coming
out
.
<EOS>
This
is
what
I
meant
when
I
brought
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whereby
,
"
proceeded
the
voice
,
"
why
not
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
what
odds
?
<EOS>
Can
any
man
say
otherwise
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Awast
then
!
"
  
When
it
had
pursued
its
train
of
argument
to
this
point
,
the
voice
stopped
,
and
rested
.
<EOS>
It
then
proceeded
very
slowly
,
thus
:
   
<EOS>
"
Do
I
believe
that
this
here
Son
and
Heir
's
gone
down
,
my
lads
?
<EOS>
Mayhap
.
<EOS>
Do
I
say
so
?
<EOS>
Which
?
<EOS>
If
a
skipper
stands
out
by
Sen
"
George
's
Channel
,
making
for
the
Downs
,
what
's
right
ahead
of
him
?
<EOS>
The
Goodwins
.
<EOS>
He
is
n't
forced
to
run
upon
the
Goodwins
,
but
he
may
.
<EOS>
The
bearings
of
this
observation
lays
in
the
application
on
it
.
<EOS>
That
an't
no
part
of
my
duty
.
<EOS>
Awast
then
,
keep
a
bright
look
-
out
for'ard
,
and
good
luck
to
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
voice
here
went
out
of
the
back
parlour
and
into
the
street
,
taking
the
Commander
of
the
Cautious
Clara
with
it
,
and
accompanying
him
on
board
again
with
all
convenient
expedition
,
where
he
immediately
turned
in
,
and
refreshed
his
mind
with
a
nap
.
  
<EOS>
The
students
of
the
sage
's
precepts
,
left
to
their
own
application
of
his
wisdom
upon
a
principle
which
was
the
main
leg
of
the
Bunsby
tripod
,
as
it
is
perchance
of
some
other
oracular
stools
---
looked
upon
one
another
in
a
little
uncertainty
;
while
Rob
the
Grinder
,
who
had
taken
the
innocent
freedom
of
peering
in
,
and
listening
,
through
the
skylight
in
the
roof
,
came
softly
down
from
the
leads
,
in
a
state
of
very
dense
confusion
.
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
however
,
whose
admiration
of
Bunsby
was
,
if
possible
,
enhanced
by
the
splendid
manner
in
which
he
had
justified
his
reputation
and
come
through
this
solemn
reference
,
proceeded
to
explain
that
Bunsby
meant
nothing
but
confidence
;
that
Bunsby
had
no
misgivings
;
and
that
such
an
opinion
as
that
man
had
given
,
coming
from
such
a
mind
as
his
,
was
Hope
's
own
anchor
,
with
good
roads
to
cast
it
in
.
<EOS>
Florence
endeavoured
to
believe
that
the
Captain
was
right
;
but
the
Nipper
,
with
her
arms
tight
folded
,
shook
her
head
in
resolute
denial
,
and
had
no
more
trust
in
Bunsby
than
in
Mr
Perch
himself
.
  
<EOS>
The
philosopher
seemed
to
have
left
Uncle
Sol
pretty
much
where
he
had
found
him
,
for
he
still
went
roaming
about
the
watery
world
,
compasses
in
hand
,
and
discovering
no
rest
for
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
pursuance
of
a
whisper
in
his
ear
from
Florence
,
while
the
old
man
was
absorbed
in
this
pursuit
,
that
Captain
Cuttle
laid
his
heavy
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
cheer
,
Sol
Gills
?
"
cried
the
Captain
,
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
so
-
so
,
Ned
,
"
returned
the
Instrument
-
maker
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
remembering
,
all
this
afternoon
,
that
on
the
very
day
when
my
boy
entered
Dombey
's
house
and
came
home
late
to
dinner
,
sitting
just
there
where
you
stand
,
we
talked
of
storm
and
shipwreck
,
and
I
could
hardly
turn
him
from
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
meeting
the
eyes
of
Florence
,
which
were
fixed
with
earnest
scrutiny
upon
his
face
,
the
old
man
stopped
and
smiled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stand
by
,
old
friend
!
"
cried
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
Look
alive
!
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
,
Sol
Gills
;
arter
I
've
convoyed
Heart's
-
delight
safe
home
,
"
here
the
Captain
kissed
his
hook
to
Florence
,
"
I
'll
come
back
and
take
you
in
tow
for
the
rest
of
this
blessed
day
.
<EOS>
You
'll
come
and
eat
your
dinner
along
with
me
,
Sol
,
somewheres
or
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
to
-
day
,
Ned
!
"
said
the
old
man
quickly
,
and
appearing
to
be
unaccountably
startled
by
the
proposition
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
do
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
returned
the
Captain
,
gazing
at
him
in
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
have
so
much
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
---
<EOS>
I
mean
to
think
of
,
and
arrange
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
do
it
,
Ned
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
out
again
,
and
be
alone
,
and
turn
my
mind
to
many
things
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
looked
at
the
Instrument
-
maker
,
and
looked
at
Florence
,
and
again
at
the
Instrument
-
maker
.
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
,
then
,
"
he
suggested
,
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
Think
of
me
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Say
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
come
here
early
,
mind
,
Sol
Gills
,
"
stipulated
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
.
<EOS>
The
first
thing
to
-
morrow
morning
,
"
said
old
Sol
;
"
and
now
good
-
bye
,
Ned
Cuttle
,
and
God
bless
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Squeezing
both
the
Captain
's
hands
,
with
uncommon
fervour
,
as
he
said
it
,
the
old
man
turned
to
Florence
,
folded
hers
in
his
own
,
and
put
them
to
his
lips
;
then
hurried
her
out
to
the
coach
with
very
singular
precipitation
.
<EOS>
Altogether
,
he
made
such
an
effect
on
Captain
Cuttle
that
the
Captain
lingered
behind
,
and
instructed
Rob
to
be
particularly
gentle
and
attentive
to
his
master
until
the
morning
:
which
injunction
he
strengthened
with
the
payment
of
one
shilling
down
,
and
the
promise
of
another
sixpence
before
noon
next
day
.
<EOS>
This
kind
office
performed
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
who
considered
himself
the
natural
and
lawful
body
-
guard
of
Florence
,
mounted
the
box
with
a
mighty
sense
of
his
trust
,
and
escorted
her
home
.
<EOS>
At
parting
,
he
assured
her
that
he
would
stand
by
Sol
Gills
,
close
and
true
;
and
once
again
inquired
of
Susan
Nipper
,
unable
to
forget
her
gallant
words
in
reference
to
Mrs
MacStinger
,
"
Would
you
,
do
you
think
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
though
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
the
desolate
house
had
closed
upon
the
two
,
the
Captain
's
thoughts
reverted
to
the
old
Instrument
-
maker
,
and
he
felt
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
instead
of
going
home
,
he
walked
up
and
down
the
street
several
times
,
and
,
eking
out
his
leisure
until
evening
,
dined
late
at
a
certain
angular
little
tavern
in
the
City
,
with
a
public
parlour
like
a
wedge
,
to
which
glazed
hats
much
resorted
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
's
principal
intention
was
to
pass
Sol
Gills
's
after
dark
,
and
look
in
through
the
window
:
which
he
did
.
<EOS>
The
parlour
door
stood
open
,
and
he
could
see
his
old
friend
writing
busily
and
steadily
at
the
table
within
,
while
the
little
Midshipman
,
already
sheltered
from
the
night
dews
,
watched
him
from
the
counter
;
under
which
Rob
the
Grinder
made
his
own
bed
,
preparatory
to
shutting
the
shop
.
<EOS>
Reassured
by
the
tranquillity
that
reigned
within
the
precincts
of
the
wooden
mariner
,
the
Captain
headed
for
Brig
Place
,
resolving
to
weigh
anchor
betimes
in
the
morning
.

Chapter
24

<EOS>
The
Study
of
a
Loving
Heart
 
SIR
BARNET
and
Lady
Skettles
,
very
good
people
,
resided
in
a
pretty
villa
at
Fulham
,
on
the
banks
of
the
Thames
;
which
was
one
of
the
most
desirable
residences
in
the
world
when
a
rowing
-
match
happened
to
be
going
past
,
but
had
its
little
inconveniences
at
other
times
,
among
which
may
be
enumerated
the
occasional
appearance
of
the
river
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
the
contemporaneous
disappearance
of
the
lawn
and
shrubbery
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Barnett
Skettles
expressed
his
personal
consequence
chiefly
through
an
antique
gold
snuff
-
box
,
and
a
ponderous
silk
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
which
he
had
an
imposing
manner
of
drawing
out
of
his
pocket
like
a
banner
,
and
using
with
both
hands
at
once
.
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
's
object
in
life
was
constantly
to
extend
the
range
of
his
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Like
a
heavy
body
dropped
into
water
---
not
to
disparage
so
worthy
a
gentleman
by
the
comparison
<EOS>
---
it
was
in
the
nature
of
things
that
Sir
Barnet
must
spread
an
ever
-
widening
circle
about
him
,
until
there
was
no
room
left
.
<EOS>
Or
,
like
a
sound
in
air
,
the
vibration
of
which
,
according
to
the
speculation
of
an
ingenious
modern
philosopher
,
may
go
on
travelling
for
ever
through
the
interminable
fields
of
space
,
nothing
but
coming
to
the
end
of
his
moral
tether
could
stop
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
in
his
voyage
of
discovery
through
the
social
system
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
was
proud
of
making
people
acquainted
with
people
.
<EOS>
He
liked
the
thing
for
its
own
sake
,
and
it
advanced
his
favourite
object
too
.
<EOS>
For
example
,
if
Sir
Barnet
had
the
good
fortune
to
get
hold
of
a
raw
recruit
,
or
a
country
gentleman
,
and
ensnared
him
to
his
hospitable
villa
,
Sir
Barnet
would
say
to
him
,
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
,
"
Now
,
my
dear
Sir
,
is
there
anybody
you
would
like
to
know
?
<EOS>
Who
is
there
you
would
wish
to
meet
?
<EOS>
Do
you
take
any
interest
in
writing
people
,
or
in
painting
or
sculpturing
people
,
or
in
acting
people
,
or
in
anything
of
that
sort
?
"
<EOS>
Possibly
the
patient
answered
yes
,
and
mentioned
somebody
,
of
whom
Sir
Barnet
had
no
more
personal
knowledge
than
of
Ptolemy
the
Great
.
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
replied
,
that
nothing
on
earth
was
easier
,
as
he
knew
him
very
well
:
immediately
called
on
the
aforesaid
somebody
,
left
his
card
,
wrote
a
short
note
,
---
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Sir
---
penalty
of
your
eminent
position
---
friend
at
my
house
naturally
desirous
---
Lady
Skettles
and
myself
participate
---
trust
that
genius
being
superior
to
ceremonies
,
you
will
do
us
the
distinguished
favour
of
giving
us
the
pleasure
,
"
&
c.
,
&
c.
---
and
so
killed
a
brace
of
birds
with
one
stone
,
dead
as
door
-
nails
.
  
<EOS>
With
the
snuff
-
box
and
banner
in
full
force
,
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
propounded
his
usual
inquiry
to
Florence
on
the
first
morning
of
her
visit
.
<EOS>
When
Florence
thanked
him
,
and
said
there
was
no
one
in
particular
whom
she
desired
to
see
<EOS>
,
it
was
natural
she
should
think
with
a
pang
,
of
poor
lost
Walter
.
<EOS>
When
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
,
urging
his
kind
offer
,
said
,
"
My
dear
Miss
Dombey
,
are
you
sure
you
can
remember
no
one
whom
your
good
papa
---
to
whom
I
beg
you
to
present
the
best
compliments
of
myself
and
Lady
Skettles
when
you
write
---
might
wish
you
to
know
?
<EOS>
"
it
was
natural
,
perhaps
,
that
her
poor
head
should
droop
a
little
,
and
that
her
voice
should
tremble
as
it
softly
answered
in
the
negative
.
  
<EOS>
Skettles
Junior
,
much
stiffened
as
to
his
cravat
,
and
sobered
down
as
to
his
spirits
,
was
at
home
for
the
holidays
,
and
appeared
to
feel
himself
aggrieved
by
the
solicitude
of
his
excellent
mother
that
he
should
be
attentive
to
Florence
.
<EOS>
Another
and
a
deeper
injury
under
which
the
soul
of
young
Barnet
chafed
,
was
the
company
of
Dr
and
Mrs
Blimber
,
who
had
been
invited
on
a
visit
to
the
paternal
roof
-
tree
,
and
of
whom
the
young
gentleman
often
said
he
would
have
preferred
their
passing
the
vacation
at
Jericho
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anybody
you
can
suggest
now
,
Doctor
Blimber
?
"
said
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
,
turning
to
that
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
,
Sir
Barnet
,
"
returned
Doctor
Blimber
.
<EOS>
"
Really
I
am
not
aware
that
there
is
,
in
particular
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
know
my
fellow
-
men
in
general
,
Sir
Barnet
.
<EOS>
What
does
Terence
say
?
<EOS>
Any
one
who
is
the
parent
of
a
son
is
interesting
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
Mrs
Blimber
any
wish
to
see
any
remarkable
person
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Sir
Barnet
,
courteously
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Blimber
replied
,
with
a
sweet
smile
and
a
shake
of
her
sky
-
blue
cap
,
that
if
Sir
Barnet
could
have
made
her
known
to
Cicero
,
she
would
have
troubled
him
;
but
such
an
introduction
not
being
feasible
,
and
she
already
enjoying
the
friendship
of
himself
and
his
amiable
lady
,
and
possessing
with
the
Doctor
her
husband
their
joint
confidence
in
regard
to
their
dear
son
---
here
young
Barnet
was
observed
to
curl
his
nose
---
she
asked
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
was
fain
,
under
these
circumstances
,
to
content
himself
for
the
time
with
the
company
assembled
.
<EOS>
Florence
was
glad
of
that
;
for
she
had
a
study
to
pursue
among
them
,
and
it
lay
too
near
her
heart
,
and
was
too
precious
and
momentous
,
to
yield
to
any
other
interest
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
some
children
staying
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Children
who
were
as
frank
and
happy
with
fathers
and
with
mothers
as
those
rosy
faces
opposite
home
.
<EOS>
Children
who
had
no
restraint
upon
their
love
,
and
freely
showed
it
.
<EOS>
Florence
sought
to
learn
their
secret
;
sought
to
find
out
what
it
was
she
had
missed
;
what
simple
art
they
knew
,
and
she
knew
not
;
how
she
could
be
taught
by
them
to
show
her
father
that
she
loved
him
,
and
to
win
his
love
again
.
  
<EOS>
Many
a
day
did
Florence
thoughtfully
observe
these
children
.
<EOS>
On
many
a
bright
morning
did
she
leave
her
bed
when
the
glorious
sun
rose
,
and
walking
up
and
down
upon
the
river
's
bank
,
before
any
one
in
the
house
was
stirring
,
look
up
at
the
windows
of
their
rooms
,
and
think
of
them
,
asleep
,
so
gently
tended
and
affectionately
thought
of
.
<EOS>
Florence
would
feel
more
lonely
then
,
than
in
the
great
house
all
alone
;
and
would
think
sometimes
that
she
was
better
there
than
here
,
and
that
there
was
greater
peace
in
hiding
herself
than
in
mingling
with
others
of
her
age
,
and
finding
how
unlike
them
all
she
was
.
<EOS>
But
attentive
to
her
study
,
though
it
touched
her
to
the
quick
at
every
little
leaf
she
turned
in
the
hard
book
,
Florence
remained
among
them
,
and
tried
with
patient
hope
,
to
gain
the
knowledge
that
she
wearied
for
.
  
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
how
to
gain
it
!
<EOS>
how
to
know
the
charm
in
its
beginning!There
were
daughters
here
,
who
rose
up
in
the
morning
,
and
lay
down
to
rest
at
night
,
possessed
of
fathers
'
hearts
already
.
<EOS>
They
had
no
repulse
to
overcome
,
no
coldness
to
dread
,
no
frown
to
smooth
away
.
<EOS>
As
the
morning
advanced
,
and
the
windows
opened
one
by
one
,
and
the
dew
began
to
dry
upon
the
flowers
and
grass
,
and
youthful
feet
began
to
move
upon
the
lawn
,
Florence
,
glancing
round
at
the
bright
faces
,
thought
what
was
there
she
could
learn
from
these
children
?
<EOS>
It
was
too
late
to
learn
from
them
;
each
could
approach
her
father
fearlessly
,
and
put
up
her
lips
to
meet
the
ready
kiss
,
and
wind
her
arm
about
the
neck
that
bent
down
to
caress
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
begin
by
being
so
bold
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
could
it
be
that
there
was
less
and
less
hope
as
she
studied
more
and
more
!
  
<EOS>
She
remembered
well
,
that
even
the
old
woman
who
had
robbed
her
when
a
little
child
---
whose
image
and
whose
house
,
and
all
she
had
said
and
done
,
were
stamped
upon
her
recollection
,
with
the
enduring
sharpness
of
a
fearful
impression
made
at
that
early
period
of
life
---
had
spoken
fondly
of
her
daughter
,
and
how
terribly
even
she
had
cried
out
in
the
pain
of
hopeless
separation
from
her
child
.
<EOS>
But
her
own
mother
,
she
would
think
again
,
when
she
recalled
this
,
had
loved
her
well
.
<EOS>
Then
,
sometimes
,
when
her
thoughts
reverted
swiftly
to
the
void
between
herself
and
her
father
,
Florence
would
tremble
,
and
the
tears
would
start
upon
her
face
,
as
she
pictured
to
herself
her
mother
living
on
,
and
coming
also
to
dislike
her
,
because
of
her
wanting
the
unknown
grace
that
should
conciliate
that
father
naturally
,
and
had
never
done
so
from
her
cradle
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
this
imagination
did
wrong
to
her
mother
's
memory
,
and
had
no
truth
in
it
,
or
base
to
rest
upon
;
and
yet
she
tried
so
hard
to
justify
him
,
and
to
find
the
whole
blame
in
herself
,
that
she
could
not
resist
its
passing
,
like
a
wild
cloud
,
through
the
distance
of
her
mind
.
   
<EOS>
There
came
among
the
other
visitors
,
soon
after
Florence
,
one
beautiful
girl
,
three
or
four
years
younger
than
she
,
who
was
an
orphan
child
,
and
who
was
accompanied
by
her
aunt
,
a
grey
-
haired
lady
,
who
spoke
much
to
Florence
,
and
who
greatly
liked
(
but
that
they
all
did
)
to
hear
her
sing
of
an
evening
,
and
would
always
sit
near
her
at
that
time
,
with
motherly
interest
.
<EOS>
They
had
only
been
two
days
in
the
house
,
when
Florence
,
being
in
an
arbour
in
the
garden
one
warm
morning
,
musingly
observant
of
a
youthful
group
upon
the
turf
,
through
some
intervening
boughs
,
and
wreathing
flowers
for
the
head
of
one
little
creature
among
them
who
was
the
pet
and
plaything
of
the
rest
,
heard
this
same
lady
and
her
niece
,
in
placing
up
and
down
a
sheltered
nook
close
by
,
speak
of
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Florence
an
orphan
like
me
,
aunt
?
"
said
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
She
has
no
mother
,
but
her
father
is
living
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
in
mourning
for
her
poor
mama
,
now
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
child
quickly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
for
her
only
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
she
no
other
brother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
sister
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
,
very
sorry
!
"
said
the
little
girl
.
  
<EOS>
As
they
stopped
soon
afterwards
to
watch
some
boats
,
and
had
been
silent
in
the
meantime
,
Florence
,
who
had
risen
when
she
heard
her
name
,
and
had
gathered
up
her
flowers
to
go
and
meet
them
,
that
they
might
know
of
her
being
within
hearing
,
resumed
her
seat
and
work
,
expecting
to
hear
no
more
;
but
the
conversation
recommenced
next
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Florence
is
a
favourite
with
every
one
here
,
and
deserves
to
be
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
the
child
,
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
is
her
papa
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
aunt
replied
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
that
she
did
not
know
.
<EOS>
Her
tone
of
voice
arrested
Florence
,
who
had
started
from
her
seat
again
;
and
held
her
fastened
to
the
spot
,
with
her
work
hastily
caught
up
to
her
bosom
,
and
her
two
hands
saving
it
from
being
scattered
on
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
in
England
,
I
hope
,
aunt
?
"
said
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
know
he
is
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Has
he
ever
been
here
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
not
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Is
he
coming
here
to
see
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
lame
,
or
blind
,
or
ill
,
aunt
?
"
asked
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
The
flowers
that
Florence
held
to
her
breast
began
to
fall
when
she
heard
those
words
,
so
wonderingly
spoken
.
<EOS>
She
held
them
closer
;
and
her
face
hung
down
upon
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Kate
,
"
said
the
lady
,
after
another
moment
of
silence
,
"
I
will
tell
you
the
whole
truth
about
Florence
as
I
have
heard
it
,
and
believe
it
to
be
.
<EOS>
Tell
no
one
else
,
my
dear
,
because
it
may
be
little
known
here
,
and
your
doing
so
would
give
her
pain
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
will
!
"
exclaimed
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
never
will
,
"
returned
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
trust
you
as
myself
.
<EOS>
I
fear
then
,
Kate
,
that
Florence
's
father
cares
little
for
her
,
very
seldom
sees
her
,
never
was
kind
to
her
in
her
life
,
and
now
quite
shuns
her
and
avoids
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
love
him
dearly
if
he
would
suffer
her
,
but
he
will
not
---
though
for
no
fault
of
hers
;
and
she
is
greatly
to
be
loved
and
pitied
by
all
gentle
hearts
.
"
  
<EOS>
More
of
the
flowers
that
Florence
held
,
fell
scattering
on
the
ground
;
those
that
remained
were
wet
,
but
not
with
dew
;
and
her
face
dropped
upon
her
laden
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Florence
!
<EOS>
Dear
,
good
Florence
!
"
cried
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
why
I
have
told
you
this
,
Kate
?
"
said
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
may
be
very
kind
to
her
,
and
take
great
care
to
try
to
please
her
.
<EOS>
Is
that
the
reason
,
aunt
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Partly
,
"
said
the
lady
,
"
but
not
all
.
<EOS>
Though
we
see
her
so
cheerful
;
with
a
pleasant
smile
for
every
one
;
ready
to
oblige
us
all
,
and
bearing
her
part
in
every
amusement
here
:
she
can
hardly
be
quite
happy
,
do
you
think
she
can
,
Kate
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
not
,
"
said
the
little
girl
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
can
understand
,
"
pursued
the
lady
,
"
why
her
observation
of
children
who
have
parents
who
are
fond
of
them
,
and
proud
of
them
---
like
many
here
,
just
now
---
should
make
her
sorrowful
in
secret
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dear
aunt
<EOS>
,
"
said
the
child
,
"
I
understand
that
very
well
.
<EOS>
Poor
Florence
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
More
flowers
strayed
upon
the
ground
,
and
those
she
yet
held
to
her
breast
trembled
as
if
a
wintry
wind
were
rustling
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
Kate
,
"
said
the
lady
,
whose
voice
was
serious
,
but
very
calm
and
sweet
,
and
had
so
impressed
Florence
from
the
first
moment
of
her
hearing
it
,
"
of
all
the
youthful
people
here
,
you
are
her
natural
and
harmless
friend
<EOS>
;
you
have
not
the
innocent
means
,
that
happier
children
have
---
"
  
"
There
are
none
happier
,
aunt
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
child
,
who
seemed
to
cling
about
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
<EOS>
As
other
children
have
,
dear
Kate
,
of
reminding
her
of
her
misfortune
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
would
have
you
,
when
you
try
to
be
her
little
friend
,
try
all
the
more
for
that
,
and
feel
that
the
bereavement
you
sustained
---
thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
before
you
knew
its
weight
---
gives
you
claim
and
hold
upon
poor
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
not
without
a
parent
's
love
,
aunt
,
and
I
never
have
been
,
"
said
the
child
,
"
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
However
that
may
be
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
the
lady
,
"
your
misfortune
is
a
lighter
one
than
Florence
's
;
for
not
an
orphan
in
the
wide
world
can
be
so
deserted
as
the
child
who
is
an
outcast
from
a
living
parent
's
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
flowers
were
scattered
on
the
ground
like
dust
;
the
empty
hands
were
spread
upon
the
face
;
and
orphaned
Florence
,
shrinking
down
upon
the
ground
,
wept
long
and
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
But
true
of
heart
and
resolute
in
her
good
purpose
,
Florence
held
to
it
as
her
dying
mother
held
by
her
upon
the
day
that
gave
Paul
life
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
how
much
she
loved
him
.
<EOS>
However
long
the
time
in
coming
,
and
however
slow
the
interval
,
she
must
try
to
bring
that
knowledge
to
her
father
's
heart
one
day
or
other
.
<EOS>
Meantime
she
must
be
careful
in
no
thoughtless
word
,
or
look
,
or
burst
of
feeling
awakened
by
any
chance
circumstance
,
to
complain
against
him
,
or
to
give
occasion
for
these
whispers
to
his
prejudice
.
  
<EOS>
Even
in
the
response
she
made
the
orphan
child
,
to
whom
she
was
attracted
strongly
,
and
whom
she
had
such
occasion
to
remember
,
Florence
was
mindful
of
him
.
<EOS>
If
she
singled
her
out
too
plainly
(
Florence
thought
)
from
among
the
rest
,
she
would
confirm
---
in
one
mind
certainly
:
perhaps
in
more
---
the
belief
that
he
was
cruel
and
unnatural
.
<EOS>
Her
own
delight
was
no
set
-
off
to
this
.
<EOS>
What
she
had
overheard
was
a
reason
,
not
for
soothing
herself
,
but
for
saving
him
;
and
Florence
did
it
,
in
pursuance
of
the
study
of
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
so
always
.
<EOS>
If
a
book
were
read
aloud
,
and
there
were
anything
in
the
story
that
pointed
at
an
unkind
father
,
she
was
in
pain
for
their
application
of
it
to
him
;
not
for
herself
.
<EOS>
So
with
any
trifle
of
an
interlude
that
was
acted
,
or
picture
that
was
shown
,
or
game
that
was
played
,
among
them
.
<EOS>
The
occasions
for
such
tenderness
towards
him
were
so
many
,
that
her
mind
misgave
her
often
,
it
would
indeed
be
better
to
go
back
to
the
old
house
,
and
live
again
within
the
shadow
of
its
dull
walls
,
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
How
few
who
saw
sweet
Florence
,
in
her
spring
of
womanhood
,
the
modest
little
queen
of
those
small
revels
,
imagined
what
a
load
of
sacred
care
lay
heavy
in
her
breast
!
<EOS>
How
few
of
those
who
stiffened
in
her
father
's
freezing
atmosphere
,
suspected
what
a
heap
of
fiery
coals
was
piled
upon
his
head
!
  
<EOS>
Florence
pursued
her
study
patiently
,
and
,
failing
to
acquire
the
secret
of
the
nameless
grace
she
sought
,
among
the
youthful
company
who
were
assembled
in
the
house
,
often
walked
out
alone
,
in
the
early
morning
,
among
the
children
of
the
poor
.
<EOS>
But
still
she
found
them
all
too
far
advanced
to
learn
from
.
<EOS>
They
had
won
their
household
places
long
ago
,
and
did
not
stand
without
,
as
she
did
,
with
a
bar
across
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
one
man
whom
she
several
times
observed
at
work
very
early
,
and
often
with
a
girl
of
about
her
own
age
seated
near
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
very
poor
man
,
who
seemed
to
have
no
regular
employment
,
but
now
went
roaming
about
the
banks
of
the
river
when
the
tide
was
low
,
looking
out
for
bits
and
scraps
in
the
mud
;
and
now
worked
at
the
unpromising
little
patch
of
garden
-
ground
before
his
cottage
;
and
now
tinkered
up
a
miserable
old
boat
that
belonged
to
him
;
or
did
some
job
of
that
kind
for
a
neighbour
,
as
chance
occurred
.
<EOS>
Whatever
the
man
's
labour
,
the
girl
was
never
employed
;
but
sat
,
when
she
was
with
him
,
in
a
listless
,
moping
state
,
and
idle
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
had
often
wished
to
speak
to
this
man
;
yet
she
had
never
taken
courage
to
do
so
,
as
he
made
no
movement
towards
her
.
<EOS>
But
one
morning
when
she
happened
to
come
upon
him
suddenly
,
from
a
by
-
path
among
some
pollard
willows
which
terminated
in
the
little
shelving
piece
of
stony
ground
that
lay
between
his
dwelling
and
the
water
,
where
he
was
bending
over
a
fire
he
had
made
to
caulk
the
old
boat
which
was
lying
bottom
upwards
,
close
by
<EOS>
,
he
raised
his
head
at
the
sound
of
her
footstep
,
and
gave
her
Good
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
morning
,
"
said
Florence
,
approaching
nearer
,
"
you
are
at
work
early
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
be
glad
to
be
often
at
work
earlier
,
Miss
,
if
I
had
work
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
so
hard
to
get
?
"
asked
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
find
it
so
,
"
replied
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
glanced
to
where
the
girl
was
sitting
,
drawn
together
,
with
her
elbows
on
her
knees
,
and
her
chin
on
her
hands
,
and
said
:
  
"
Is
that
your
daughter
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
raised
his
head
quickly
,
and
looking
towards
the
girl
with
a
brightened
face
,
nodded
to
her
,
and
said
"
Yes
.
"
<EOS>
Florence
looked
towards
her
too
,
and
gave
her
a
kind
salutation
;
the
girl
muttered
something
in
return
,
ungraciously
and
sullenly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
in
want
of
employment
also
?
"
said
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
The
man
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
Miss
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
work
for
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
there
only
you
two
,
then
?
"
inquired
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
us
two
,
"
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
mother
has
been
dead
these
ten
year
.
<EOS>
Martha
!
<EOS>
"
(
he
lifted
up
his
head
again
,
and
whistled
to
her
)
"
wo
n't
you
say
a
word
to
the
pretty
young
lady
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
girl
made
an
impatient
gesture
with
her
cowering
shoulders
,
and
turned
her
head
another
way
.
<EOS>
Ugly
,
misshapen
,
peevish
,
ill
-
conditioned
,
ragged
,
dirty
---
but
beloved
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes!Florence
had
seen
her
father
's
look
towards
her
,
and
she
knew
whose
look
it
had
no
likeness
to
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
she
's
worse
this
morning
,
my
poor
girl
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
man
,
suspending
his
work
,
and
contemplating
his
ill
-
favoured
child
,
with
a
compassion
that
was
the
more
tender
for
being
rough
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
ill
,
then
!
"
said
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
The
man
drew
a
deep
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
my
Martha
's
had
five
short
days
'
good
health
,
"
he
answered
,
looking
at
her
still
,
"
in
as
many
long
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
<EOS>
and
more
than
that
,
John
,
"
said
a
neighbour
,
who
had
come
down
to
help
him
with
the
boat
.
  
<EOS>
"
More
than
that
,
you
say
,
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
other
,
pushing
back
his
battered
hat
,
and
drawing
his
hand
across
his
forehead
.
"
<EOS>
Very
like
.
<EOS>
It
seems
long
,
long
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
the
more
the
time
,
"
pursued
the
neighbour
,
"
the
more
you
've
favoured
and
humoured
her
,
John
,
till
she
's
got
to
be
a
burden
to
herself
,
and
everybody
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
to
me
,
"
said
her
father
,
falling
to
his
work
again
.
<EOS>
"
Not
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
could
feel
---
who
better
?
<EOS>
---
how
truly
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
She
drew
a
little
closer
to
him
,
and
would
have
been
glad
to
touch
his
rugged
hand
,
and
thank
him
for
his
goodness
to
the
miserable
object
that
he
looked
upon
with
eyes
so
different
from
any
other
man
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
would
favour
my
poor
girl
---
to
call
it
favouring
---
if
I
did
n't
?
"
said
the
father
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
cried
the
neighbour
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
reason
,
John
.
<EOS>
But
you!You
rob
yourself
to
give
to
her
.
<EOS>
You
bind
yourself
hand
and
foot
on
her
account
.
<EOS>
You
make
your
life
miserable
along
of
her
.
<EOS>
And
what
does
she
care
!
<EOS>
You
do
n't
believe
she
knows
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
father
lifted
up
his
head
again
,
and
whistled
to
her
.
<EOS>
Martha
made
the
same
impatient
gesture
with
her
crouching
shoulders
,
in
reply
;
and
he
was
glad
and
happy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
for
that
,
Miss
,
"
said
the
neighbour
,
with
a
smile
,
in
which
there
was
more
of
secret
sympathy
than
he
expressed
;
"
only
to
get
that
,
he
never
lets
her
out
of
his
sight
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Because
the
day'll
come
,
and
has
been
coming
a
long
while
,
"
observed
the
other
,
bending
low
over
his
work
,
"
when
to
get
half
as
much
from
that
unfort'nate
child
of
mine
---
to
get
the
trembling
of
a
finger
,
or
the
waving
of
a
hair
---
would
be
to
raise
the
dead
.
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
softly
put
some
money
near
his
hand
on
the
old
boat
,
and
left
him
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
Florence
began
to
think
,
<EOS>
if
she
were
to
fall
ill
,
if
she
were
to
fade
like
her
dear
brother
,
would
he
then
know
that
she
had
loved
him
;
would
she
then
grow
dear
to
him
;
would
he
come
to
her
bedside
,
when
she
was
weak
and
dim
of
sight
,
and
take
her
into
his
embrace
,
and
cancel
all
the
past
?
<EOS>
Would
he
so
forgive
her
,
in
that
changed
condition
,
for
not
having
been
able
to
lay
open
her
childish
heart
to
him
,
as
to
make
it
easy
to
relate
with
what
emotions
she
had
gone
out
of
his
room
that
night
;
what
she
had
meant
to
say
if
she
had
had
the
courage
;
and
how
she
had
endeavoured
,
afterwards
,
to
learn
the
way
she
never
knew
in
infancy
?
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
she
thought
if
she
were
dying
,
he
would
relent
.
<EOS>
She
thought
,
that
if
she
lay
,
serene
and
not
unwilling
to
depart
,
upon
the
bed
that
was
curtained
round
with
recollections
of
their
darling
boy
,
he
would
be
touched
home
,
and
would
say
,
"
Dear
Florence
,
live
for
me
,
and
we
will
love
each
other
as
we
might
have
done
,
and
be
as
happy
as
we
might
have
been
these
many
years
!
"
<EOS>
She
thought
that
if
she
heard
such
words
from
him
,
and
had
her
arms
clasped
round
him
,
she
could
answer
with
a
smile
,
"
It
is
too
late
for
anything
but
this
;
I
never
could
be
happier
,
dear
father
!
"
<EOS>
and
so
leave
him
,
with
a
blessing
on
her
lips
.
  
<EOS>
The
golden
water
she
remembered
on
the
wall
,
appeared
to
Florence
,
in
the
light
of
such
reflections
,
only
as
a
current
flowing
on
to
rest
,
and
to
a
region
where
the
dear
ones
,
gone
before
,
were
waiting
,
hand
in
hand
;
and
often
when
she
looked
upon
the
darker
river
rippling
at
her
feet
,
she
thought
with
awful
wonder
,
but
not
terror
,
of
that
river
which
her
brother
had
so
often
said
was
bearing
him
away
.
  
<EOS>
The
father
and
his
sick
daughter
were
yet
fresh
in
Florence
's
mind
,
and
,
indeed
,
that
incident
was
not
a
week
old
,
when
Sir
Barnet
and
his
lady
going
out
walking
in
the
lanes
one
afternoon
,
proposed
to
her
to
bear
them
company
.
<EOS>
Florence
readily
consenting
,
Lady
Skettles
ordered
out
young
Barnet
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
For
nothing
delighted
Lady
Skettles
so
much
,
as
beholding
her
eldest
son
with
Florence
on
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
Barnet
,
to
say
the
truth
,
appeared
to
entertain
an
opposite
sentiment
on
the
subject
,
and
on
such
occasions
frequently
expressed
himself
audibly
,
though
indefinitely
,
in
reference
to
"
a
parcel
of
girls
.
<EOS>
"
As
it
was
not
easy
to
ruffle
her
sweet
temper
,
however
,
Florence
generally
reconciled
the
young
gentleman
to
his
fate
after
a
few
minutes
,
and
they
strolled
on
amicably
:
Lady
Skettles
and
Sir
Barnet
<EOS>
following
,
in
a
state
of
perfect
complacency
and
high
gratification
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
order
of
procedure
on
the
afternoon
in
question
:
and
Florence
had
almost
succeeded
in
overruling
the
present
objections
of
Skettles
Junior
to
his
destiny
,
when
a
gentleman
on
horseback
came
riding
by
,
looked
at
them
earnestly
as
he
passed
,
drew
in
his
rein
,
wheeled
round
,
an
came
riding
back
again
,
hat
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
The
gentleman
had
looked
particularly
at
Florence
;
and
when
the
little
party
stopped
,
on
his
riding
back
,
he
bowed
to
her
,
before
saluting
Sir
Barnet
and
his
lady
.
<EOS>
Florence
had
no
remembrance
of
having
ever
seen
him
,
but
she
started
involuntarily
when
he
came
near
her
,
and
drew
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
horse
is
perfectly
quiet
,
I
assure
you
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
,
but
something
in
the
gentleman
himself
---
Florence
could
not
have
said
what
---
that
made
her
recoil
as
if
she
had
been
stung
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
honour
to
address
Miss
Dombey
,
I
believe
?
"
said
the
gentleman
,
with
a
most
persuasive
smile
.
<EOS>
On
Florence
inclining
her
head
,
he
added
,
"
My
name
is
Carker
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
hope
to
be
remembered
by
Miss
Dombey
,
except
by
name
.
<EOS>
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
,
sensible
of
a
strange
inclination
to
shiver
,
though
the
day
was
hot
,
presented
him
to
her
host
and
hostess
;
by
whom
he
was
very
graciously
received
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
pardon
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
"
a
thousand
times
!
<EOS>
But
I
am
going
down
to
-
morrow
morning
to
Mr
Dombey
,
at
Leamington
,
and
if
Miss
Dombey
can
intrust
me
with
any
commission
,
need
<EOS>
I
say
how
very
happy
I
shall
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
immediately
divining
that
Florence
would
desire
to
write
a
letter
to
her
father
,
proposed
to
return
,
and
besought
Mr
Carker
to
come
home
and
dine
in
his
riding
gear
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
had
the
misfortune
to
be
engaged
to
dinner
,
but
if
Miss
Dombey
wished
to
write
,
nothing
would
delight
him
more
than
to
accompany
them
back
,
and
to
be
her
faithful
slave
in
waiting
as
long
as
she
pleased
.
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
with
his
widest
smile
,
and
bent
down
close
to
her
to
pat
his
horse
's
neck
,
Florence
meeting
his
eyes
,
saw
,
rather
than
heard
him
say
,
"
There
is
no
news
of
the
ship
!
"
  
<EOS>
Confused
,
frightened
,
shrinking
from
him
,
and
not
even
sure
that
he
had
said
those
words
<EOS>
,
for
he
seemed
to
have
shown
them
to
her
in
some
extraordinary
manner
through
his
smile
,
instead
of
uttering
them
,
Florence
faintly
said
that
she
was
obliged
to
him
,
but
she
would
not
write
;
she
had
nothing
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
to
send
,
Miss
Dombey
?
"
said
the
man
of
teeth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
but
my
---
but
my
dear
love
---
if
you
please
.
"
  
<EOS>
Disturbed
as
Florence
was
,
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
face
with
an
imploring
and
expressive
look
,
that
plainly
besought
him
,
if
he
knew
---
which
he
as
plainly
did
---
that
any
message
between
her
and
her
father
was
an
uncommon
charge
,
but
that
one
most
of
all
,
to
spare
her
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
smiled
and
bowed
low
,
and
being
charged
by
Sir
Barnet
with
the
best
compliments
of
himself
and
Lady
Skettles
,
took
his
leave
and
rode
away
:
leaving
a
favourable
impression
on
that
worthy
couple
.
<EOS>
Florence
was
seized
with
such
a
shudder
as
he
went
,
that
Sir
Barnet
,
adopting
the
popular
superstition
,
supposed
somebody
was
passing
over
her
grave
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
,
turning
a
corner
,
on
the
instant
,
looked
back
,
and
bowed
,
and
disappeared
,
as
if
he
rode
off
to
the
churchyard
straight
,
to
do
it
.

Strange
News
of
Uncle
Sol
 
CAPTAIN
CUTTLE
,
though
no
sluggard
,
did
not
turn
out
so
early
on
the
morning
after
he
had
seen
Sol
Gills
,
through
the
shop
-
window
,
writing
in
the
parlour
,
with
the
Midshipman
upon
the
counter
,
and
Rob
the
Grinder
making
up
his
bed
below
it
,
but
that
the
clocks
struck
six
as
he
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
,
and
took
a
survey
of
his
little
chamber
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
's
eyes
must
have
done
severe
duty
,
if
he
usually
opened
them
as
wide
on
awaking
as
he
did
that
morning
;
and
were
but
roughly
rewarded
for
their
vigilance
,
if
he
generally
rubbed
them
half
as
hard
.
<EOS>
But
the
occasion
was
no
common
one
,
for
Rob
the
Grinder
had
certainly
never
stood
in
the
doorway
of
Captain
Cuttle
's
bedroom
before
,
and
in
it
he
stood
then
,
panting
at
the
Captain
,
with
a
flushed
and
touzled
air
of
bed
about
him
,
that
greatly
heightened
both
his
colour
and
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
Holloa
!
"
roared
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
Before
Rob
could
stammer
a
word
in
answer
,
Captain
Cuttle
turned
out
,
all
in
a
heap
,
and
covered
the
boy
's
mouth
with
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Steady
,
my
lad
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
do
n't
ye
speak
a
word
to
me
as
yet
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
looking
at
his
visitor
in
great
consternation
,
gently
shouldered
him
into
the
next
room
,
after
laying
this
injunction
upon
him
;
and
disappearing
for
a
few
moments
<EOS>
,
forthwith
returned
in
the
blue
suit
.
<EOS>
Holding
up
his
hand
in
token
of
the
injunction
not
yet
being
taken
off
,
Captain
Cuttle
walked
up
to
the
cupboard
,
and
poured
himself
out
a
dram
;
a
counterpart
of
which
he
handed
to
the
messenger
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
then
stood
himself
up
in
a
corner
,
against
the
wall
,
as
if
to
forestall
the
possibility
of
being
knocked
backwards
by
the
communication
that
was
to
be
made
to
him
;
and
having
swallowed
his
liquor
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
messenger
,
and
his
face
as
pale
as
his
face
could
be
,
requested
him
to
"
heave
ahead
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
mean
,
tell
you
,
Captain
?
"
asked
Rob
,
who
had
been
greatly
impressed
by
these
precautions
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
said
Rob
,
"
I
ai
n't
got
much
to
tell
.
<EOS>
But
look
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
Rob
produced
a
bundle
of
keys
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
surveyed
them
,
remained
in
his
corner
,
and
surveyed
the
messenger
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
look
here
!
"
<EOS>
pursued
Rob
.
  
<EOS>
The
boy
produced
a
sealed
packet
,
which
Captain
Cuttle
stared
at
as
he
had
stared
at
the
keys
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
woke
this
morning
,
Captain
,
"
said
Rob
,
"
which
was
about
a
quarter
after
five
<EOS>
,
I
found
these
on
my
pillow
.
<EOS>
The
shop
-
door
was
unbolted
and
unlocked
,
and
Mr
Gills
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gone
!
"
<EOS>
roared
the
Captain
.
   
<EOS>
"
Flowed
,
sir
,
"
returned
Rob
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
's
voice
was
so
tremendous
,
and
he
came
out
of
his
corner
with
such
way
on
him
,
that
Rob
retreated
before
him
into
another
corner
:
holding
out
the
keys
and
packet
,
to
prevent
himself
from
being
run
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
For
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
sir
,
"
cried
Rob
,
"
is
on
the
keys
,
and
on
the
packet
too
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
and
honour
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
I
do
n't
know
anything
more
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
may
die
if
I
do
!
<EOS>
Here
's
a
sitiwation
for
a
lad
that
's
just
got
a
sitiwation
,
"
cried
the
unfortunate
Grinder
,
screwing
his
cuff
into
his
face
;
"
his
master
bolted
with
his
place
,
and
him
blamed
for
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
These
lamentations
had
reference
to
Captain
Cuttle
's
gaze
,
or
rather
glare
,
which
was
full
of
vague
suspicions
,
threatenings
,
and
denunciations
.
<EOS>
Taking
the
proffered
packet
from
his
hand
,
the
Captain
opened
it
and
read
as
follows
:
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Ned
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
Enclosed
is
my
will
!
"
<EOS>
The
Captain
turned
it
over
,
with
a
doubtful
look
---
"
and
Testament
.
<EOS>
---
Where
's
the
Testament
?
"
said
the
Captain
,
instantly
impeaching
the
ill
-
fated
Grinder
.
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
done
with
that
,
my
lad
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
it
,
"
whimpered
Rod
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
keep
on
suspecting
an
innocent
lad
,
Captain
.
<EOS>
I
never
touched
the
Testament
.
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
shook
his
head
,
implying
that
somebody
must
be
made
answerable
for
it
;
and
gravely
proceeded
:
---
   
"
Which
do
n't
break
open
for
a
year
,
or
until
you
have
decisive
intelligence
of
my
dear
Walter
,
who
is
dear
to
you
Ned
,
too
,
<EOS>
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Captain
paused
and
shook
his
head
in
some
emotion
;
then
,
as
a
re
-
establishment
of
his
dignity
in
this
trying
position
,
looked
with
exceeding
sternness
at
the
Grinder
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
should
never
hear
of
me
,
or
see
me
more
,
Ned
,
remember
an
old
friend
as
he
will
remember
you
to
the
last
---
kindly
;
and
at
least
until
the
period
I
have
mentioned
has
expired
,
keep
a
home
in
the
old
place
for
Walter
.
<EOS>
There
are
no
debts
,
the
loan
from
Dombey
's
house
is
paid
off
,
and
all
my
keys
I
send
with
this
.
<EOS>
Keep
this
quite
,
and
make
no
inquiry
for
me
;
it
is
useless
.
<EOS>
So
no
more
,
dear
Ned
,
from
your
true
friend
,
Solomon
Gills
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Captain
took
a
long
breath
,
and
then
read
these
words
,
written
below
:
"
<EOS>
"
The
boy
Rob
,
well
recommended
,
as
I
told
you
,
from
Dombey
's
house
.
<EOS>
If
all
else
should
come
to
the
hammer
,
take
care
,
Ned
,
of
the
little
Midshipman
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
To
convey
to
posterity
any
idea
of
the
manner
in
which
the
Captain
,
after
turning
this
letter
over
and
over
,
and
reading
it
a
score
of
times
,
sat
down
in
his
chair
,
and
held
a
court
-
martial
on
the
subject
in
his
own
mind
,
would
require
the
united
genius
of
all
the
great
men
,
who
,
discarding
their
own
untoward
days
,
have
determined
to
go
down
to
posterity
,
and
have
never
got
there
.
<EOS>
At
first
the
Captain
was
too
much
confounded
and
distressed
to
think
of
anything
but
the
letter
itself
;
and
even
when
his
thoughts
began
to
glance
upon
the
various
attendant
facts
,
they
might
,
perhaps
,
as
well
have
occupied
themselves
with
their
former
theme
,
for
any
light
they
reflected
on
them
.
<EOS>
In
this
state
of
mind
,
Captain
Cuttle
having
the
Grinder
before
the
court
,
and
no
one
else
,
found
it
a
great
relief
to
decide
,
generally
,
that
he
was
an
object
of
suspicion
:
which
the
Captain
so
clearly
expressed
in
his
visage
,
that
Rob
remonstrated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
,
Captain
!
"
cried
the
Grinder
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
how
you
can
!
<EOS>
what
have
I
done
to
be
looked
at
,
like
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lad
,
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
do
n't
you
sing
out
afore
<EOS>
you
're
hurt
.
<EOS>
And
do
n't
you
commit
yourself
,
whatever
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
been
and
committed
nothing
,
Captain
!
"
answered
Rob
.
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
her
free
,
then
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
impressively
,
"
and
ride
easy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
deep
sense
of
the
responsibility
imposed
upon
him
,
and
the
necessity
of
thoroughly
fathoming
this
mysterious
affair
,
as
became
a
man
in
his
relations
with
the
parties
,
Captain
Cuttle
resolved
to
go
down
and
examine
the
premises
,
and
to
keep
the
Grinder
with
him
.
<EOS>
Considering
that
youth
as
under
arrest
at
present
,
the
Captain
was
in
some
doubt
whether
it
might
not
be
expedient
to
handcuff
him
,
or
tie
his
ankles
together
,
or
attach
a
weight
to
his
legs
;
but
not
being
clear
as
to
the
legality
of
such
formalities
,
the
Captain
decided
merely
to
hold
him
by
the
shoulder
all
the
way
,
and
knock
him
down
if
he
made
any
objection
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
he
made
none
,
and
consequently
got
to
the
Instrument
-
maker
's
house
without
being
placed
under
any
more
stringent
restraint
.
<EOS>
As
the
shutters
were
not
yet
taken
down
,
the
Captain
's
first
care
was
to
have
the
shop
opened
;
and
when
the
daylight
was
freely
admitted
,
he
proceeded
,
with
its
aid
,
to
further
investigation
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
's
first
care
was
to
establish
himself
in
a
chair
in
the
shop
,
as
President
of
the
solemn
tribunal
that
was
sitting
within
him
;
and
to
require
Rob
to
lie
down
in
his
bed
under
the
counter
,
show
exactly
where
he
discovered
the
keys
and
packet
when
he
awoke
<EOS>
,
how
he
found
the
door
when
he
went
to
try
it
,
how
he
started
off
to
Brig
Place
---
cautiously
preventing
the
latter
imitation
from
being
carried
farther
than
the
threshold
---
and
so
on
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
.
<EOS>
When
all
this
had
been
done
several
times
,
the
Captain
shook
his
head
and
seemed
to
think
the
matter
had
a
bad
look
.
  
<EOS>
Next
,
the
Captain
,
with
some
indistinct
idea
of
finding
a
body
,
instituted
a
strict
search
over
the
whole
house
;
groping
in
the
cellars
with
a
lighted
candle
,
thrusting
his
hook
behind
doors
,
bringing
his
head
into
violent
contact
with
beams
,
and
covering
himself
with
cobwebs
.
<EOS>
Mounting
up
to
the
old
man
's
bed
-
room
,
they
found
that
he
had
not
been
in
bed
on
the
previous
night
,
but
had
merely
lain
down
on
the
coverlet
,
as
was
evident
from
the
impression
yet
remaining
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
think
,
Captain
,
"
said
Rob
,
looking
round
the
room
,
"
that
when
Mr
Gills
was
going
in
and
out
so
often
,
these
last
few
days
,
he
was
taking
little
things
away
,
piecemeal
,
not
to
attract
attention
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
"
said
the
Captain
,
mysteriously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
so
,
my
lad
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
returned
Rob
,
looking
about
,
"
I
do
n't
see
his
shaving
tackle
.
<EOS>
Nor
his
brushes
,
Captain
.
<EOS>
Nor
no
shirts
.
<EOS>
Nor
yet
his
shoes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
each
of
these
articles
was
mentioned
,
Captain
Cuttle
took
particular
notice
of
the
corresponding
department
of
the
Grinder
,
lest
he
should
appear
to
have
been
in
recent
use
,
or
should
prove
to
be
in
present
possession
thereof
.
<EOS>
But
Rob
had
no
occasion
to
shave
,
certainly
was
not
brushed
,
and
wore
the
clothes
he
had
worn
for
a
long
time
past
,
beyond
all
possibility
of
mistake
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
should
you
say
,
"
said
the
Captain
---
"
not
committing
yourself
---
about
his
time
of
sheering
off
?
<EOS>
Hey
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
think
,
Captain
,
"
returned
Rob
,
"
that
he
must
have
gone
pretty
soon
after
I
began
to
snore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
o'clock
was
that
?
"
said
the
Captain
,
prepared
to
be
very
particular
about
the
exact
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
tell
,
Captain
!
"
answered
Rob
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
that
I
'm
a
heavy
sleeper
at
first
,
and
a
light
one
towards
morning
;
and
if
Mr
Gills
has
come
through
the
shop
near
daybreak
,
though
ever
so
much
on
tip
-
toe
,
I
'm
pretty
sure
I
should
have
heard
him
shut
the
door
at
all
events
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
mature
consideration
of
this
evidence
,
Captain
Cuttle
began
to
think
that
the
Instrument
-
maker
must
have
vanished
of
his
own
accord
;
to
which
logical
conclusion
he
was
assisted
by
the
letter
addressed
to
himself
,
which
,
as
being
unquestionably
in
the
old
man
's
handwriting
,
would
seem
,
with
no
great
forcing
,
to
bear
the
construction
,
that
he
arranged
of
his
own
will
,
to
go
,
and
so
went
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
had
next
to
consider
where
and
why
?
<EOS>
and
as
there
was
no
way
whatsoever
that
he
saw
to
the
solution
of
the
first
difficulty
,
he
confined
his
media
-
tuitions
to
the
second
.
  
<EOS>
Remembering
the
old
man
's
curious
manner
,
and
the
farewell
he
had
taken
of
him
;
unaccountably
fervent
at
the
time
,
but
quite
intelligible
now
:
a
terrible
apprehension
strengthened
on
the
Captain
,
that
,
overpowered
by
his
anxieties
and
regrets
for
Walter
,
he
had
been
driven
to
commit
suicide
.
<EOS>
Unequal
to
the
wear
and
tear
of
daily
life
,
as
he
had
often
professed
himself
to
be
,
and
shaken
as
he
no
doubt
<EOS>
was
by
the
uncertainty
and
deferred
hope
he
had
undergone
<EOS>
,
it
seemed
no
violently
strained
misgiving
,
but
only
too
probable
.
  
<EOS>
Free
from
debt
,
and
with
no
fear
for
his
personal
liberty
,
or
the
seizure
of
his
goods
,
what
else
but
such
a
state
of
madness
could
have
hurried
him
away
alone
and
secretly
?
<EOS>
As
to
his
carrying
some
apparel
with
him
,
if
he
had
really
done
so
---
and
they
were
not
even
sure
of
that
---
he
might
have
done
so
,
the
Captain
argued
,
to
prevent
inquiry
,
to
distract
attention
from
his
probable
fate
,
or
to
ease
the
very
mind
that
was
now
revolving
all
these
possibilities
.
<EOS>
Such
,
reduced
into
plain
language
,
and
condensed
within
a
small
compass
,
was
the
final
result
and
substance
of
Captain
Cuttle
's
deliberations
:
which
took
a
long
time
to
arrive
at
this
pass
,
and
were
,
like
some
more
public
deliberations
,
very
discursive
and
disorderly
.
  
<EOS>
Dejected
and
despondent
in
the
extreme
<EOS>
,
Captain
Cuttle
felt
it
just
to
release
Rob
from
the
arrest
in
which
he
had
placed
him
,
and
to
enlarge
him
,
subject
to
a
kind
of
honourable
inspection
which
he
still
resolved
to
exercise
;
and
having
hired
a
man
,
from
Brogley
the
Broker
,
to
sit
in
the
shop
during
their
absence
,
the
Captain
,
taking
Rob
with
him
,
issued
forth
upon
a
dismal
quest
after
the
mortal
remains
of
Solomon
Gills
.
  
<EOS>
Not
a
station
-
house
or
bone
-
house
,
or
work
-
house
in
the
metropolis
escaped
a
visitation
from
the
hard
glazed
hat
.
<EOS>
Along
the
wharves
,
among
the
shipping
on
the
bank
-
side
,
up
the
river
,
down
the
river
,
here
,
there
,
everywhere
,
it
went
gleaming
where
men
were
thickest
,
like
the
hero
's
helmet
in
an
epic
battle
.
<EOS>
For
a
whole
week
the
Captain
read
of
all
the
found
and
missing
people
in
all
the
newspapers
and
handbills
,
and
went
forth
on
expeditions
at
all
hours
of
the
day
to
identify
Solomon
Gills
,
in
poor
little
ship
-
boys
who
had
fallen
over
-
board
,
an
in
tall
foreigners
with
dark
beards
who
had
taken
poison
---
"
to
make
sure
,
"
Captain
Cuttle
said
,
"
that
it
warn't
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
sure
thing
that
it
never
was
,
and
that
the
good
Captain
had
no
other
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
at
last
abandoned
these
attempts
as
hopeless
,
and
set
himself
to
consider
what
was
to
be
done
next
.
<EOS>
After
several
new
perusals
of
his
poor
friend
's
letter
,
he
considered
that
the
maintenance
of
"
a
home
in
the
old
place
for
Walter
"
was
the
primary
duty
imposed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
the
Captain
's
decision
was
,
that
he
would
keep
house
on
the
premises
of
Solomon
Gills
himself
,
and
would
go
into
the
instrument
-
business
,
and
see
what
came
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
as
this
step
involved
the
relinquishment
of
his
apartments
at
Mrs
MacStinger
's
,
and
he
knew
that
resolute
woman
would
never
hear
of
his
deserting
them
,
the
Captain
took
the
desperate
determination
of
running
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
look
ye
here
,
my
lad
,
"
said
the
Captain
to
Rob
,
when
he
had
matured
this
notable
scheme
,
"
to
-
morrow
,
I
sha
n't
be
found
in
this
here
roadstead
till
night
---
not
till
arter
midnight
p'rhaps
.
<EOS>
But
you
keep
watch
till
you
hear
me
knock
,
and
the
moment
you
do
,
turn
-
to
,
and
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
good
,
Captain
,
"
said
Rob
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
continue
to
be
rated
on
these
here
books
,
"
pursued
the
Captain
condescendingly
,
"
and
I
do
n't
say
<EOS>
but
what
you
may
get
promotion
,
if
you
and
me
should
pull
together
with
a
will
.
<EOS>
But
the
moment
you
hear
me
knock
to
-
morrow
night
,
whatever
time
it
is
,
turn
-
to
and
show
yourself
smart
with
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
sure
to
do
it
,
Captain
,
"
replied
Rob
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
you
understand
,
"
resumed
the
Captain
,
coming
back
again
to
enforce
this
charge
upon
his
mind
,
"
there
may
be
,
for
anything
I
can
say
,
a
chase
;
and
I
might
be
took
while
I
was
waiting
,
if
you
did
n't
show
yourself
smart
with
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Rob
again
assured
the
Captain
that
he
would
be
prompt
and
wakeful
;
and
the
Captain
having
made
this
prudent
arrangement
,
went
home
to
Mrs
MacStinger
's
for
the
last
time
.
  
<EOS>
The
sense
the
Captain
had
of
its
being
the
last
time
,
and
of
the
awful
purpose
hidden
beneath
his
blue
waistcoat
,
inspired
him
with
such
a
mortal
dread
of
Mrs
MacStinger
,
that
the
sound
of
that
lady
's
foot
down
stairs
at
any
time
of
the
day
,
was
sufficient
to
throw
him
into
a
fit
of
trembling
.
<EOS>
It
fell
out
,
too
,
that
Mrs
MacStinger
was
in
a
charming
temper
---
mild
and
placid
as
a
house
-
lamb
;
and
Captain
Cuttle
's
conscience
suffered
terrible
twinges
,
when
she
came
up
to
inquire
if
she
could
cook
him
nothing
for
his
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
nice
small
kidney
-
pudding
now
,
Cap'en
Cuttle
,
"
said
his
landlady
:
"
or
a
sheep
's
heart
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
mind
my
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
thank'ee
,
Ma'am
,
"
returned
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
a
roast
fowl
,
"
said
Mrs
MacStinger
,
"
with
a
bit
of
weal
stuffing
and
some
egg
sauce
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Cap'en
Cuttle!Give
yourself
a
little
treat
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
thank'ee
,
Ma'am
,
"
returned
the
Captain
very
humbly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I'am
sure
you
're
out
of
sorts
,
and
want
to
be
stimulated
,
"
said
Mrs
MacStinger
.
<EOS>
"
Why
not
have
,
for
once
in
a
way
,
a
bottle
of
sherry
wine
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Ma'am
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
the
Captain
,
"
if
you
'd
be
so
good
as
take
a
glass
or
two
,
I
think
I
would
try
that
.
<EOS>
Would
you
do
me
the
favour
,
Ma'am
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
torn
to
pieces
by
his
conscience
,
"
to
accept
a
quarter
's
rent
ahead
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
so
,
Cap'en
Cuttle
?
"
retorted
Mrs
MacStinger
---
sharply
,
as
the
Captain
thought
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
was
frightened
to
death
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
would
,
Ma'am
,
"
he
said
with
submission
,
"
it
would
oblige
me
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
keep
my
money
very
well
.
<EOS>
It
pays
itself
out
.
<EOS>
I
should
take
it
kind
if
you
'd
comply
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Cap'en
Cuttle
,
"
said
the
unconscious
MacStinger
,
rubbing
her
hands
,
"
you
can
do
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
for
me
,
with
my
family
,
to
refuse
,
no
more
than
it
is
to
ask
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
would
you
,
Ma'am
.
"
said
the
Captain
,
taking
down
the
tin
canister
in
which
he
kept
his
cash
,
from
the
top
shelf
of
the
cupboard
,
"
be
so
good
as
offer
eighteen
-
pence
a
-
piece
to
the
little
family
all
round
?
<EOS>
If
you
could
make
it
convenient
,
Ma'am
,
to
pass
the
word
presently
for
them
children
to
come
for'ard
,
in
a
body
,
I
should
be
glad
to
see
'
em
.
"
  
<EOS>
These
innocent
MacStingers
were
so
many
daggers
to
the
Captain
's
breast
,
when
they
appeared
in
a
swarm
,
and
tore
at
him
with
the
confiding
trustfulness
he
so
little
deserved
.
<EOS>
The
eye
of
Alexander
MacStinger
,
who
had
been
his
favourite
,
was
insupportable
to
the
Captain
;
the
voice
of
Juliana
MacStinger
,
who
was
the
picture
of
her
mother
,
made
a
coward
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
kept
up
appearances
,
nevertheless
,
tolerably
well
,
and
for
an
hour
or
two
was
very
hardly
used
and
roughly
handled
by
the
young
MacStingers
:
who
in
their
childish
frolics
,
did
a
little
damage
also
to
the
glazed
hat
,
by
sitting
in
it
,
two
at
a
time
,
as
in
a
nest
,
and
drumming
on
the
inside
of
the
crown
with
their
shoes
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
Captain
sorrowfully
dismissed
them
:
taking
leave
of
these
cherubs
with
the
poignant
remorse
and
grief
of
a
man
who
was
going
to
execution
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
silence
of
night
,
the
Captain
packed
up
his
heavier
property
in
a
chest
,
which
he
locked
,
intending
to
leave
it
there
,
in
all
probability
for
ever
,
but
on
the
forlorn
chance
of
one
day
finding
a
man
sufficiently
bold
and
desperate
to
come
and
ask
for
it
.
<EOS>
Of
his
lighter
necessaries
,
the
Captain
made
a
bundle
;
and
disposed
his
plate
about
his
person
,
ready
for
flight
.
<EOS>
At
the
hour
of
midnight
,
when
Brig
Place
was
buried
in
slumber
,
and
Mrs
MacStinger
was
lulled
in
sweet
oblivion
,
with
her
infants
around
her
,
the
guilty
Captain
,
stealing
down
on
tiptoe
,
in
the
dark
,
opened
the
door
,
closed
it
softly
after
him
,
and
took
to
his
heels
.
  
<EOS>
Pursued
by
the
image
of
Mrs
MacStinger
springing
out
of
bed
,
and
,
regardless
of
costume
,
following
and
bringing
him
back
;
pursued
also
by
a
consciousness
of
his
enormous
crime
;
Captain
Cuttle
held
on
at
a
great
pace
,
and
allowed
no
grass
to
grow
under
his
feet
,
between
Brig
Place
and
the
Instrument
-
maker
's
door
.
<EOS>
It
opened
when
he
knocked
---
for
Rob
was
on
the
watch
---
and
when
it
was
bolted
and
locked
behind
him
,
Captain
Cuttle
felt
comparatively
safe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whew
!
"
cried
the
Captain
,
looking
round
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
breather
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
the
matter
,
is
there
,
Captain
?
"
cried
the
gaping
Rob
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
!
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
,
after
changing
colour
,
and
listening
to
a
passing
footstep
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
mind
ye
,
my
lad
;
if
any
lady
,
except
either
of
them
two
as
you
see
t'other
day
,
ever
comes
and
asks
for
Cap'en
Cuttle
,
be
sure
to
report
no
person
of
that
name
known
,
nor
never
heard
of
here
;
observe
them
orders
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
care
,
Captain
,
"
returned
Rob
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
say
---
if
you
liked
,
"
hesitated
the
Captain
,
"
that
you
'd
read
in
the
paper
that
a
Cap'en
of
that
name
was
gone
to
Australia
,
emigrating
,
along
with
a
whole
ship
's
complement
of
people
as
had
all
swore
never
to
come
back
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rob
nodded
his
understanding
of
these
instructions
;
and
Captain
Cuttle
promising
to
make
a
man
of
him
,
if
he
obeyed
orders
,
dismissed
him
,
yawning
,
to
his
bed
under
the
counter
,
and
went
aloft
to
the
chamber
of
Solomon
Gills
.
  
<EOS>
What
the
Captain
suffered
next
day
,
whenever
a
bonnet
passed
,
or
how
often
he
darted
out
of
the
shop
to
elude
imaginary
MacStingers
,
and
sought
safety
in
the
attic
,
can
not
be
told
.
<EOS>
But
to
avoid
the
fatigues
attendant
on
this
means
of
self
-
preservation
,
the
Captain
curtained
the
glass
door
of
communication
between
the
shop
and
parlour
,
on
the
inside
,
fitted
a
key
to
it
from
the
bunch
that
had
been
sent
to
him
:
and
cut
a
small
hole
of
espial
in
the
wall
.
<EOS>
The
advantage
of
this
fortification
is
obvious
.
<EOS>
On
a
bonnet
appearing
,
the
Captain
instantly
slipped
into
his
garrison
,
locked
himself
up
,
and
took
a
secret
observation
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Finding
it
a
false
alarm
,
the
Captain
instantly
slipped
out
again
.
<EOS>
And
the
bonnets
in
the
street
were
so
very
numerous
,
and
alarms
were
so
inseparable
from
their
appearance
,
that
the
Captain
was
almost
incessantly
slipping
in
and
out
all
day
long
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
found
time
,
however
,
in
the
midst
of
this
fatiguing
service
to
inspect
the
stock
;
in
connexion
with
which
he
had
the
general
idea
(
very
laborious
to
Rob
)
that
too
much
friction
could
not
be
bestowed
upon
it
,
and
that
it
could
not
be
made
too
bright
.
<EOS>
He
also
ticketed
a
few
attractive
-
looking
articles
at
a
venture
,
at
prices
ranging
from
ten
shillings
to
fifty
pounds
,
and
exposed
them
in
the
window
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
public
.
  
<EOS>
After
effecting
these
improvements
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
surrounded
by
the
instruments
,
began
to
feel
scientific
:
and
looked
up
at
the
stars
at
night
,
through
the
skylight
,
when
he
was
smoking
his
pipe
in
the
little
back
parlour
before
going
to
bed
,
as
if
he
had
established
a
kind
of
property
in
them
.
<EOS>
As
a
tradesman
in
the
City
,
too
,
he
began
to
have
an
interest
in
the
Lord
Mayor
,
and
the
Sheriffs
,
and
in
Public
Companies
;
and
felt
bound
to
read
the
quotations
of
the
Funds
every
day
,
though
he
was
unable
to
make
out
,
on
any
principle
of
navigation
,
what
the
figures
meant
,
and
could
have
very
well
dispensed
with
the
fractions
.
<EOS>
Florence
,
the
Captain
waited
on
,
with
his
strange
news
of
Uncle
Sol
,
immediately
after
taking
possession
of
the
Midshipman
;
but
she
was
away
from
home
.
<EOS>
So
the
Captain
sat
himself
down
in
his
altered
station
of
life
,
with
no
company
but
Rob
the
Grinder
;
and
losing
count
of
time
,
as
men
do
when
great
changes
come
upon
them
,
thought
musingly
of
Walter
,
and
of
Solomon
Gills
,
and
even
of
Mrs
MacStinger
herself
,
as
among
the
things
that
had
been
.

Mr

the

just
arrived
at

just
introduced

showed
the

trusted

said
the

lowering
his

but
not
lowering
it
so
much
as
to
render
it
inaudible
to
that

Mr

snapped
at

<EOS>
In

<EOS>
Exactly

<EOS>
Mr
Carker
's
excessively
friendly
inclinations
towards
the
Major
,
and
Mr
Carker
's
admiration
of
his
roughness
,
toughness
,
and
plainness
,
gleamed
out
of
every
tooth
in
Mr
Carker
's
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Major
,
"
<EOS>
you
and
Dombey
have
the
devil
's
own
amount
of
business
to
talk
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
,
Major
,
"
observed
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dombey
,
"
said
the
Major
,
defiantly
,
"
I
know
better
;
a
man
of
your
mark
---
the
Colossus
of
commerce
---
is
not
to
be
interrupted
.
<EOS>
Your
moments
are
precious
.
<EOS>
We
shall
meet
at
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
In
the
interval
,
old
Joseph
will
be
scare
.
<EOS>
The
dinner
-
hour
is
a
sharp
seven
,
Mr
Carker
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
the
Major
,
greatly
swollen
as
to
his
face
,
withdrew
;
but
immediately
putting
in
his
head
at
the
door
again
,
said
:
  
"
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
Dombey
,
have
you
any
message
to
'
em
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
in
some
embarrassment
,
and
not
without
a
glance
at
the
courteous
keeper
of
his
business
confidence
,
entrusted
the
Major
with
his
compliments
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
the
Lord
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Major
,
"
you
must
make
it
something
warmer
than
that
,
or
old
Joe
will
be
far
from
welcome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Regards
then
,
if
you
will
,
Major
,
"
returned
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Damme
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Major
,
shaking
his
shoulders
and
his
great
cheeks
jocularly
<EOS>
:
"
make
it
something
warmer
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
you
please
,
then
,
Major
,
"
observed
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
friend
is
sly
,
Sir
,
sly
,
Sir
,
de
-
vilish
sly
,
"
said
the
Major
staring
round
the
door
at
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
So
is
Bagstock
.
"
<EOS>
But
stopping
in
the
midst
of
a
chuckle
,
and
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
,
the
Major
solemnly
exclaimed
,
as
he
struck
himself
on
the
chest
,
"
Dombey
!
<EOS>
I
envy
your
feelings
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
"
and
withdrew
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
found
the
gentleman
a
great
resource
,
"
said
Carker
,
following
his
with
his
teeth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
great
indeed
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
friends
here
,
no
doubt
,
"
pursued
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
I
perceive
,
from
what
he
has
said
,
that
you
go
into
society
here
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
"
smiling
horribly
,
"
I
am
so
very
glad
that
you
go
into
society
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
acknowledged
this
display
of
interest
on
the
part
of
his
second
in
command
,
by
twirling
his
watch
-
chain
,
and
slightly
moving
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
formed
for
society
.
"
said
Carker
,
"
Of
all
the
men
<EOS>
I
know
,
you
are
the
best
adapted
,
by
nature
and
by
position
,
for
society
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
I
have
been
frequently
amazed
that
you
should
have
held
it
at
arm
's
length
so
long
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
my
reasons
,
Carker
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
alone
,
and
indifferent
to
it
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
great
social
qualifications
yourself
,
and
are
the
more
likely
to
have
been
surprised
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
!
"
returned
the
other
,
with
ready
self
-
disparagement
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
another
matter
in
the
case
of
a
man
like
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
come
into
comparison
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
put
his
hand
to
his
neckcloth
,
settled
his
chin
in
it
,
coughed
,
and
stood
looking
at
his
faithful
friend
and
servant
for
a
few
moments
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
,
Carker
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
at
length
:
<EOS>
making
as
if
he
swallowed
something
a
little
too
large
for
his
throat
:
"
to
present
you
to
my
---
to
the
Major
's
friends
.
<EOS>
Highly
agreeable
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ladies
among
them
,
I
presume
?
"
insinuated
the
smooth
Manager
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
all
---
that
is
to
say
,
they
are
both
---
ladies
,
"
replied
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
two
?
"
smiled
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
only
two
.
<EOS>
I
have
confined
my
visits
to
their
residence
,
and
have
made
no
other
acquaintance
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sisters
,
perhaps
?
"
quoth
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
and
daughter
,
"
replied
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
As
Mr
Dombey
dropped
his
eyes
,
and
adjusted
his
neck
-
cloth
again
,
the
smiling
face
of
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
became
in
a
moment
,
and
without
any
stage
of
transition
,
transformed
into
a
most
intent
and
frowning
face
,
scanning
his
closely
,
and
with
an
ugly
sneer
.
<EOS>
As
Mr
Dombey
raised
his
eyes
,
it
changed
back
,
no
less
quickly
,
to
its
old
expression
,
and
showed
him
every
gum
of
which
it
stood
possessed
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
,
"
said
Carker
,
"
I
shall
be
delighted
to
know
them
.
<EOS>
Speaking
of
daughters
,
I
have
seen
Miss
Dombey
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
sudden
rush
of
blood
to
Mr
Dombey
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
took
the
liberty
of
waiting
on
her
,
"
said
Carker
,
"
to
inquire
if
she
could
charge
me
with
any
little
commission
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
so
fortunate
as
to
be
the
bearer
of
any
<EOS>
but
her
---
but
her
dear
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Wolf
's
face
that
it
was
then
,
with
even
the
hot
tongue
revealing
itself
through
the
stretched
mouth
,
as
the
eyes
encountered
Mr
Dombey
's
!
  
<EOS>
"
What
business
intelligence
is
there
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
latter
gentleman
,
after
a
silence
,
during
which
Mr
Carker
had
produced
some
memoranda
and
other
papers
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
very
little
,
"
returned
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
the
whole
we
have
not
had
our
usual
good
fortune
of
late
,
but
that
is
of
little
moment
to
you
.
<EOS>
At
Lloyd
's
,
they
give
up
the
Son
and
Heir
for
lost
.
<EOS>
Well
,
she
was
insured
,
from
her
keel
to
her
masthead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Carker
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
taking
a
chair
near
him
,
"
I
can
not
say
that
young
man
,
Gay
,
ever
impressed
me
favourably
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nor
me
,
"
interposed
the
Manager
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
wish
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
without
heeding
the
interruption
,
"
he
had
never
gone
on
board
that
ship
.
<EOS>
I
wish
he
had
never
been
sent
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
pity
you
did
n't
say
so
,
in
good
time
,
is
it
not
?
"
<EOS>
retorted
Carker
,
coolly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
However
,
I
think
it
's
all
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
I
really
think
it
's
all
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
Did
I
mention
that
there
was
something
like
a
little
confidence
between
Miss
Dombey
and
myself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
sternly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
,
"
returned
Mr
Carker
,
after
an
impressive
pause
,
"
that
wherever
Gay
is
,
he
is
much
better
where
he
is
,
<EOS>
that
at
home
here
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
,
or
could
be
,
in
your
place
,
I
should
be
satisfied
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
satisfied
of
it
myself
.
<EOS>
Miss
Dombey
is
confiding
and
young
---
perhaps
hardly
proud
enough
,
for
your
daughter
---
if
she
have
a
fault
.
<EOS>
Not
that
that
is
much
though
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
Will
you
check
these
balances
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
leaned
back
in
his
chair
,
instead
of
bending
over
the
papers
that
were
laid
before
him
,
and
looked
the
Manager
steadily
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
The
Manager
,
with
his
eyelids
slightly
raised
,
affected
to
be
glancing
at
his
figures
,
and
to
await
the
leisure
of
his
principal
.
<EOS>
He
showed
that
he
affected
this
,
as
if
from
great
delicacy
,
and
with
a
design
to
spare
Mr
Dombey
's
feelings
;
and
the
latter
,
as
he
looked
at
him
,
was
cognizant
of
his
intended
consideration
,
and
felt
that
but
for
it
,
this
confidential
Carker
would
have
said
a
great
deal
more
,
which
he
,
Mr
Dombey
,
was
too
proud
to
ask
for
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
way
in
business
,
often
.
<EOS>
Little
by
little
,
Mr
Dombey
's
gaze
relaxed
,
and
his
attention
became
diverted
to
the
papers
before
him
;
but
while
busy
with
the
occupation
they
afforded
him
,
he
frequently
stopped
,
and
looked
at
Mr
Carker
again
.
<EOS>
Whenever
he
did
so
,
Mr
Carker
was
demonstrative
,
as
before
,
in
his
delicacy
,
and
impressed
it
on
his
great
chief
more
and
more
.
  
<EOS>
While
they
were
thus
engaged
;
and
under
the
skilful
culture
of
the
Manager
,
angry
thoughts
in
reference
to
poor
Florence
brooded
and
bred
in
Mr
Dombey
's
breast
,
usurping
the
place
of
the
cold
dislike
that
generally
reigned
there
;
Major
Bagstock
,
much
admired
by
the
old
ladies
of
Leamington
,
and
followed
by
the
Native
,
carrying
the
usual
amount
of
light
baggage
,
straddled
along
the
shady
side
of
the
way
,
to
make
a
morning
call
on
Mrs
Skewton
.
<EOS>
It
being
mid
-
day
when
the
Major
reached
the
bower
of
Cleopatra
,
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
find
his
Princess
on
her
usual
sofa
,
languishing
over
a
cup
of
coffee
,
with
the
room
so
darkened
and
shaded
for
her
more
luxurious
repose
,
that
Withers
,
who
was
in
attendance
on
her
,
loomed
like
a
phantom
page
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
insupportable
creature
is
this
,
coming
in
?
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
Go
away
,
whoever
you
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
the
heart
to
banish
JB
.
<EOS>
Ma'am
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
Major
,
halting
midway
,
to
remonstrate
,
with
his
cane
over
his
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
it
's
you
,
is
it
?
<EOS>
On
second
thoughts
,
you
may
enter
,
"
observed
Cleopatra
.
  
<EOS>
The
Major
entered
accordingly
,
and
advancing
to
the
sofa
pressed
her
charming
hand
to
his
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
"
said
Cleopatra
,
listlessly
waving
her
fan
,
"
a
long
way
off
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
come
too
near
me
,
for
I
am
frightfully
faint
and
sensitive
this
morning
,
and
you
smell
of
the
Sun
.
<EOS>
You
are
absolutely
tropical
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
George
,
Ma'am
,
"
said
the
Major
,
"
the
time
has
been
when
Joseph
Bagstock
has
been
grilled
and
blistered
by
the
Sun
;
the
time
was
,
when
he
was
forced
,
Ma'am
,
into
such
full
blow
,
by
high
hothouse
heat
in
the
West
Indies
,
that
he
was
known
as
the
Flower
.
<EOS>
A
man
never
heard
of
Bagstock
,
Ma'am
,
in
those
days
;
he
heard
of
the
Flower
---
the
Flower
of
Ours
.
<EOS>
The
Flower
may
have
faded
,
more
or
less
,
Ma'am
,
"
observed
the
Major
,
dropping
into
a
much
nearer
chair
than
had
been
indicated
by
his
cruel
Divinity
,
"
but
it
is
a
tough
plant
yet
,
and
constant
as
the
evergreen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
the
Major
,
under
cover
of
the
dark
room
,
shut
up
one
eye
,
rolled
his
head
like
a
Harlequin
,
and
,
in
his
great
self
-
satisfaction
,
perhaps
went
nearer
to
the
confines
of
apoplexy
than
he
had
ever
gone
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Mrs
Granger
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Cleopatra
of
her
page
.
  
<EOS>
Withers
believed
she
was
in
her
own
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
.
<EOS>
"
Go
away
,
and
shut
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
am
engaged
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
Withers
disappeared
,
Mrs
Skewton
turned
her
head
languidly
towards
the
Major
,
without
otherwise
moving
,
and
asked
him
how
his
friend
was
?
  
<EOS>
"
Dombey
,
Ma'am
,
"
returned
the
Major
,
with
a
facetious
gurgling
in
his
throat
,
"
is
as
well
as
a
man
in
his
condition
can
be
.
<EOS>
His
condition
is
a
desperate
one
,
Ma'am
.
<EOS>
He
is
touched
,
is
Dombey
!
<EOS>
Touched
!
"
cried
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
bayonetted
through
the
body
.
"
  
<EOS>
Cleopatra
cast
a
sharp
look
at
the
Major
,
that
contrasted
forcibly
with
the
affected
drawl
in
which
she
presently
said
---
   
"
<EOS>
Major
Bagstock
,
although
I
know
<EOS>
but
little
of
the
world
,
---
nor
can
I
really
regret
my
inexperience
,
for
I
fear
it
is
a
false
place
,
full
of
withering
conventionalities
:
where
Nature
is
but
little
regarded
,
and
where
the
music
of
the
heart
,
and
the
gushing
of
the
soul
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
,
which
is
so
truly
poetical
,
is
seldom
heard
,
---
<EOS>
I
can
not
misunderstand
your
meaning
.
<EOS>
There
is
an
allusion
to
Edith
---
to
my
extremely
dear
child
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
tracing
the
outline
of
her
eyebrows
with
her
forefinger
,
"
in
your
words
,
to
which
the
tenderest
of
chords
vibrates
excessively
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bluntness
,
Ma'am
,
"
returned
the
Major
,
"
has
ever
been
the
characteristic
of
the
Bagstock
breed
.
<EOS>
You
are
right
,
Joe
admits
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
that
allusion
,
"
pursued
Cleopatra
,
"
would
involve
one
of
the
most
---
if
not
positively
the
most
---
touching
,
and
thrilling
,
and
sacred
emotions
of
which
our
sadly
-
fallen
nature
is
susceptible
,
I
conceive
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
laid
his
hand
upon
his
lips
,
and
wafted
a
kiss
to
Cleopatra
,
as
if
to
identify
the
emotion
in
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
that
I
am
weak
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
am
wanting
in
that
energy
,
which
should
sustain
a
mama
:
not
to
say
a
parent
:
on
such
a
subject
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
trimming
her
lips
with
the
laced
edge
of
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
can
hardly
approach
a
topic
so
excessively
momentous
to
my
dearest
Edith
without
a
feeling
of
faintness
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
bad
man
,
as
you
have
boldly
remarked
upon
it
,
and
as
it
has
occasioned
me
great
anguish
:
"
Mrs
Skewton
touched
her
left
side
with
her
fan
:
"
I
will
not
shrink
from
my
duty
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
,
under
cover
of
the
dimness
,
swelled
,
and
swelled
,
and
rolled
his
purple
face
about
,
and
winked
his
lobster
eye
,
until
he
fell
into
a
fit
of
wheezing
,
which
obliged
him
to
rise
and
take
a
turn
or
two
about
the
room
,
before
his
fair
friend
could
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dombey
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
when
she
at
length
resumed
,
"
was
obliging
enough
,
now
many
weeks
ago
,
to
do
us
the
honour
of
visiting
us
here
;
in
company
,
my
dear
Major
,
with
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
acknowledge
---
<EOS>
let
me
be
open
---
that
it
is
my
failing
to
be
the
creature
of
impulse
,
and
to
wear
my
heart
,
as
it
were
,
outside
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
failing
full
well
.
<EOS>
My
enemy
can
not
know
it
better
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
penitent
;
I
would
rather
not
be
frozen
by
the
heartless
world
,
and
am
content
to
bear
this
imputation
justly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
arranged
her
tucker
,
pinched
her
wiry
throat
to
give
it
a
soft
surface
,
and
went
on
,
with
great
complacency
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
gave
me
(
my
dearest
Edith
too
,
I
am
sure
)
<EOS>
infinite
pleasure
to
receive
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
As
a
friend
of
yours
,
my
dear
Major
,
we
were
naturally
disposed
to
be
prepossessed
in
his
favour
;
and
I
fancied
that
I
observed
an
amount
of
Heart
in
Mr
Dombey
,
that
was
excessively
refreshing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
devilish
little
heart
in
Dombey
now
,
Ma'am
,
"
said
the
Major
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wretched
man
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Skewton
,
looking
at
him
languidly
,
"
pray
be
silent
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
JB
is
dumb
,
Ma'am
,
"
said
the
Major
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dombey
,
"
pursued
Cleopatra
,
smoothing
the
rosy
hue
upon
her
cheeks
,
"
accordingly
repeated
his
visit
;
and
possibly
finding
some
attraction
in
the
simplicity
and
primitiveness
of
our
tastes
---
<EOS>
for
there
is
always
a
charm
in
nature
<EOS>
---
it
is
so
very
sweet
---
became
one
of
our
little
circle
every
evening
.
<EOS>
Little
did
I
think
of
the
awful
responsibility
into
which
I
plunged
when
I
encouraged
Mr
Dombey
---
to
---
"
   
"
To
beat
up
these
quarters
,
Ma'am
,
"
suggested
Major
Bagstock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Coarse
person
!
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
you
anticipate
my
meaning
,
though
in
odious
language
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Mrs
Skewton
rested
her
elbow
on
the
little
table
at
her
side
,
and
suffering
her
wrist
to
droop
in
what
she
considered
a
graceful
and
becoming
manner
,
dangled
her
fan
to
and
fro
,
and
lazily
admired
her
hand
while
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
agony
I
have
endured
,
"
she
said
mincingly
,
"
as
the
truth
has
by
degrees
dawned
upon
me
,
has
been
too
exceedingly
terrific
to
dilate
upon
.
<EOS>
My
whole
existence
is
bound
up
in
my
sweetest
Edith
;
and
to
see
her
change
from
day
to
day
---
<EOS>
my
beautiful
pet
,
who
has
positively
garnered
up
her
heart
since
the
death
of
that
most
delightful
creature
,
Granger
---
is
the
most
affecting
thing
in
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
's
world
was
not
a
very
trying
one
,
if
one
might
judge
of
it
by
the
influence
of
its
most
affecting
circumstance
upon
her
;
but
this
by
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Edith
,
"
simpered
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
who
is
the
perfect
pearl
of
my
life
,
is
said
to
resemble
me
.
<EOS>
I
believe
we
are
alike
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
one
man
in
the
world
who
never
will
admit
that
any
one
resembles
you
,
Ma'am

"
said
the
Major
;
"
and
that
man
's
name
is
Old
Joe
Bagstock
.
"
  
<EOS>
Cleopatra
made
as
if
she
would
brain
the
flatterer
with
her
fan
,
but
relenting
,
smiled
upon
him
and
proceeded
:
  
"
If
my
charming
girl
inherits
any
advantages
from
me
,
wicked
one
!
"
<EOS>
:
the
Major
was
the
wicked
one
:
"
she
inherits
also
my
foolish
nature
.
<EOS>
She
has
great
force
of
character
---
mines
has
been
said
to
be
immense
,
though
I
do
n't
believe
it
---
but
once
moved
,
she
is
susceptible
and
sensitive
to
the
last
extent
.
<EOS>
What
are
my
feelings
when
I
see
her
pining
!
<EOS>
They
destroy
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
advancing
his
double
chin
,
and
pursing
up
his
blue
lips
into
a
soothing
expression
,
affected
the
profoundest
sympathy
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
confidence
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
that
has
subsisted
between
us
---
the
free
development
of
soul
,
and
openness
of
sentiment
---
is
touching
to
think
of
.
<EOS>
We
have
been
more
like
sisters
than
mama

child

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
JB
's
own
sentiment

observed
the
Major
,
"
expressed
by
JB
fifty
thousand
times
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
interrupt
,
rude
man
!
"
said
Cleopatra
.
<EOS>
"
What
are
my
feelings
,
then
,
when
I
find
that
there
is
one
subject
avoided
by
us
!
<EOS>
That
there
is
a
what's
-
his
-
name
---
a
gulf
---
opened
between
us
.
<EOS>
That
my
own
artless
Edith
is
changed
to
<EOS>
me!They
are
of
the
most
poignant
description
,
of
course
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
left
his
chair
,
and
took
one
nearer
to
the
little
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
From
day
to
day
I
see
this
,
my
dear
Major
,
"
proceeded
Mrs
Skewton
.
<EOS>
"
From
day
to
day
I
feel
this
.
<EOS>
From
hour
to
hour
I
reproach
myself
for
that
excess
of
faith
and
trustfulness
which
has
led
to
such
distressing
consequences
;
and
almost
from
minute
to
minute
,
I
hope
that
Mr
Dombey
may
explain
himself
,
and
relieve
the
torture
I
undergo
,
which
is
extremely
wearing
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
happens
,
my
dear
Major
;
I
am
the
salve
of
remorse
---
take
care
of
the
coffee
-
cup
:
<EOS>
you
are
so
very
awkward
---
<EOS>
my
darling
Edith
is
an
altered
being
;
and
I
really
do
n't
see
what
is
to
be
done
,
or
what
good
creature
I
can
advise
with
.
"
  
<EOS>
Major
Bagstock
,
encouraged
perhaps
by
the
softened
and
confidential
tone
into
which
Mrs
Skewton
,
after
several
times
lapsing
into
it
for
a
moment
,
seemed
now
to
have
subsided
for
good
,
stretched
out
his
hand
across
the
little
table
,
and
said
with
a
leer
,
  
"
Advise
with
Joe
,
Ma'am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
you
aggravating
monster
,
"
said
Cleopatra
,
giving
one
hand
to
the
Major
,
and
tapping
his
knuckles
with
her
fan
,
which
she
held
in
the
other
:
"
why
do
n't
you
talk
to
me
?
<EOS>
you
know
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
tell
me
something
to
the
purpose
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
laughed
,
and
kissed
the
hand
she
had
bestowed
upon
him
,
and
laughed
again
immensely
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
as
much
Heart
in
Mr
Dombey
as
I
gave
him
credit
for
?
"
languished
Cleopatra
tenderly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
think
he
is
in
earnest
,
my
dear
Major
?
<EOS>
Would
you
recommend
his
being
spoken
to
,
or
his
being
left
alone
?
<EOS>
Now
tell
me
,
like
a
dear
man
,
what
would
you
advise
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
marry
him
to
Edith
Granger
,
Ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
chuckled
the
Major
,
hoarsely
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mysterious
creature
!
"
returned
Cleopatra
,
bringing
her
fan
to
bear
upon
the
Major
's
nose
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
we
marry
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
marry
him
to
Edith
Granger
,
Ma'am
,
I
say
?
<EOS>
"
chuckled
the
Major
again
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
returned
no
answer
in
words
,
but
smiled
upon
the
Major
with
so
much
archness
and
vivacity
,
that
that
gallant
officer
considering
himself
challenged
,
would
have
imprinted
a
kiss
on
her
exceedingly
red
lips
,
but
for
her
interposing
the
fan
with
a
very
winning
and
juvenile
dexterity
.
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
in
modesty
;
it
might
have
been
in
apprehension
of
some
danger
to
their
bloom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dombey
,
Ma'am
,
"
said
the
Major
,
"
is
a
great
catch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mercenary
wretch
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Cleopatra
,
with
a
little
shriek
,
"
I
am
shocked
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
Dombey
,
Ma'am
,
"
pursued
the
Major
,
thrusting
forward
his
head
,
and
distending
his
eyes
,
"
is
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
Joseph
says
it
;
Bagstock
knows
it
;
JB
keeps
him
to
the
mark
.
<EOS>
Leave
Dombey
to
himself
,
Ma'am

<EOS>
Dombey
is
safe
,
Ma'am
.
<EOS>
Do
as
you
have
done
;
do
no
more

and
trust
to
JB
for
the
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
really
think
so
,
my
dear
Major
?
"
returned
Cleopatra
,
who
had
eyed
him
very
cautiously
,
and
very
searchingly
,
in
spite
of
her
listless
bearing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sure
of
it
,
Ma'am
,
"
rejoined
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Cleopatra
the
peerless
,
and
her
Antony
Bagstock
,
will
often
speak
of
this
,
triumphantly
,
when
sharing
the
elegance
and
wealth
of
Edith
Dombey
's
establishment
.
<EOS>
Dombey
's
right
-
hand
man

Ma'am

said
the
Major
,
stopping
abruptly
in
a
chuckle
,
and
becoming
serious
,
"
has
arrived
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
This
morning

"
said
Cleopatra
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
morning

Ma'am

"
returned
the
Major
.
"
<EOS>
And
Dombey
's
anxiety
for
his
arrival
,
ma'am
,
is
to
be
referred
---
take
JB
's
word
for
this
;
for
Joe
is
de
-
vilish
sly
"
---
the
Major
tapped
his
nose
,
and
screwed
up
one
of
his
eyes
tight
:
which
did
not
enhance
his
native
beauty
---
"
to
his
desire
that
what
is
in
the
wind
should
become
known
to
him
,
without
Dombey
's
telling
and
consulting
him
.
<EOS>
For
Dombey
is
as
proud
,
Ma'am
,
"
said
the
Major
,
"
as
Lucifer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
charming
quality
,
"
lisped
Mrs
Skewton
;
"
reminding
one
of
dearest
Edith
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
Ma'am
,
"
said
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
thrown
out
hints
already
,
and
the
right
-
hand
man
understands
'em
;
and
I
'll
throw
out
more
,
before
the
day
is
done
.
<EOS>
Dombey
projected
this
morning
a
ride
to
Warwick
Castle
,
and
to
Kenilworth
,
to
-
morrow
,
to
be
preceded
by
a
breakfast
with
us
.
<EOS>
I
undertook
the
delivery
of
this
invitation
.
<EOS>
Will
you
honour
us
so
far
,
Ma'am
?
"
said
the
Major
,
swelling
with
shortness
of
breath
and
slyness
,
as
he
produced
a
note
,
addressed
to
the
Honourable
Mrs
Skewton
,
by
favour
of
Major
Bagstock
,
wherein
hers
ever
faithfully
,
Paul
Dombey
,
besought
her
and
her
amiable
and
accomplished
daughter
to
consent
to
the
proposed
excursion
;
and
in
a
postscript
unto
which
,
the
same
ever
faithfully
Paul
Dombey
entreated
to
be
recalled
to
the
remembrance
of
Mrs
Granger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
said
Cleopatra
,
suddenly
,
"
Edith
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
loving
mother
can
scarcely
be
described
as
resuming
her
insipid
and
affected
air
when
she
made
this
exclamation
;
for
she
had
never
cast
it
off
;
nor
was
it
likely
that
she
ever
would
or
could
,
in
any
other
place
than
in
the
grave
.
<EOS>
But
hurriedly
dismissing
whatever
shadow
of
earnestness
,
or
faint
confession
of
a
purpose
,
laudable
or
wicked
,
that
her
face
,
or
voice
,
or
manner
,
had
,
for
the
moment
,
betrayed
,
she
lounged
upon
the
couch
,
her
most
insipid
and
most
languid
self
again
,
as
Edith
entered
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Edith
,
so
beautiful
and
stately
,
but
so
cold
and
so
repelling
.
<EOS>
Who
,
slightly
acknowledging
the
presence
of
Major
Bagstock
,
and
directing
a
keen
glance
at
her
mother
,
drew
back
the
curtain
from
a
window
,
and
sat
down
there
,
looking
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Edith
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
where
on
earth
have
you
been
?
<EOS>
I
have
wanted
you
,
my
love
,
most
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
said
you
were
engaged
,
and
I
stayed
away
,
"
she
answered
,
without
turning
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
cruel
to
Old
Joe
,
Ma'am
,
"
said
the
Major
in
his
gallantry
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
very
cruel
,
I
know
,
"
she
said
,
still
looking
out
---
and
said
with
such
calm
disdain
,
that
the
Major
was
discomfited
,
and
could
think
of
nothing
in
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Major
Bagstock
,
my
darling
Edith
,
"
drawled
her
mother
,
"
who
is
generally
the
most
useless
and
disagreeable
creature
in
the
world
:
as
you
know
---
"
  
"
It
is
surely
not
worth
<EOS>
while
,
Mama
,
"
said
Edith
,
looking
round
,
"
to
observe
these

<EOS>
The
quite
scorn
that
sat
upon
her
handsome
face
---
<EOS>
a
scorn
that
evidently
lighted
on
herself
,
no
less
than
them
---
was
so
intense
and
deep
,
that
her
mother
's
simper
,
for
the
instant
,
though
of
a
hardy
constitution
,
drooped
before
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
darling
girl
,
"
she
began
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
woman
yet
?
<EOS>
"
said
Edith
,
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
very
odd
you
are
to
-
day
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
Pray
let
me
say
,
my
love
,
that
Major
Bagstock
has
brought
the
kindest
of
notes
from
Mr
Dombey
,
proposing
that
we
should
breakfast
with
him
to
-
morrow
,
and
ride
to
Warwick
and
Kenilworth
.
<EOS>
Will
you
go
,
Edith
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
will
I
go
!
"
<EOS>
she
repeated
,
turning
very
red
,
and
breathing
quickly
as
she
looked
round
at
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
would
,
my
own
,
"
observed
the
latter
carelessly
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
as
you
say
,
quite
a
form
to
ask
.
<EOS>
Here
is
Mr
Dombey
's
letter
,
Edith
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
desire
to
read
it
,
"
was
her
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
perhaps
I
had
better
answer
it
myself
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
though
I
had
thought
of
asking
you
to
be
my
secretary
,
darling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
Edith
made
no
movement
and
no
answer
,
Mrs
Skewton
begged
the
Major
to
wheel
her
little
table
nearer
,
and
to
set
open
the
desk
it
contained
,
and
to
take
out
pen
and
paper
for
her
;
all
which
congenial
offices
of
gallantry
the
Major
discharged
,
with
much
submission
and
devotion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
regards
,
Edith
,
my
dear
?
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
pausing
,
pen
in
hand
,
at
the
postscript
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
you
will
,
Mama
,
"
she
answered
,
without
turning
her
head
,
and
with
supreme
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
wrote
what
she
would
,
without
seeking
for
any
more
explicit
directions
,
and
handed
her
letter
to
the
Major
,
who
receiving
it
as
a
precious
charge
,
made
a
show
of
laying
it
near
his
heart
,
but
was
fain
to
put
it
in
the
pocket
of
his
pantaloons
on
account
of
the
insecurity
of
his
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
The
Major
then
took
a
very
polished
and
chivalrous
farewell
of
both
ladies
,
which
the
elder
one
acknowledged
in
her
usual
manner
,
while
the
younger
,
sitting
with
her
face
addressed
to
the
window
,
bent
her
head
so
slightly
that
it
would
have
been
a
greater
compliment
to
the
Major
to
have
made
no
sign
at
all
,
and
to
have
left
him
to
infer
that
he
had
not
been
heard
or
thought
of
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
alteration
in
her
,
Sir
,
"
mused
the
Major
on
his
way
back
;
on
which
expedition
---
the
afternoon
being
sunny
and
hot
---
he
ordered
the
Native
and
the
light
baggage
to
the
front
,
and
walked
in
the
shadow
of
that
expatriated
prince
:
"
as
to
alteration
,
Sir
,
and
pining
,
and
so
forth
,
that
wo
n't
go
down
with
Joseph
Bagstock
.
<EOS>
None
of
that
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
do
here
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
there
being
something
of
a
division
between
'em
---
or
a
gulf
as
the
mother
calls
it
---
damme
,
Sir
,
that
seems
true
enough
.
<EOS>
And
it
's
odd
enough
!
<EOS>
Well
,
Sir
!
"
panted
the
Major
,
"
<EOS>
Edith
Granger
and
Dombey
are
well
matched
;
let
'em
fight
it
out
!
<EOS>
Bagstock
backs
the
winner
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
Major
,
by
saying
these
latter
words
aloud
,
in
the
vigour
of
his
thoughts
,
caused
the
unhappy
Native
to
stop
,
and
turn
round
,
in
the
belief
that
he
was
personally
addressed
.
<EOS>
Exasperated
to
the
last
degree
by
this
act
of
insubordination
,
the
Major
(
though
he
was
swelling
with
enjoyment
of
his
own
humour
,
at
the
moment
of
its
occurrence
)
instantly
thrust
his
cane
among
the
Native
's
ribs
,
and
continued
to
stir
him
up
,
at
short
intervals
,
all
the
way
to
the
Hotel
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
was
the
Major
less
exasperated
as
he
dressed
for
dinner
,
during
which
operation
the
dark
servant
underwent
the
pelting
of
a
shower
of
miscellaneous
objects
,
varying
in
size
from
a
boot
to
a
hairbrush
,
and
including
everything
that
came
within
his
master
's
reach
.
<EOS>
For
the
Major
plumbed
himself
on
having
the
Native
in
a
perfect
state
of
drill
,
and
visited
the
least
departure
from
strict
discipline
with
this
kind
of
fatigue
duty
.
<EOS>
Add
to
this
,
that
he
maintained
the
Native
about
his
person
as
a
counter
-
irritant
against
the
gout
,
and
all
other
vexations
,
mental
as
well
as
bodily
;
and
the
Native
would
appear
to
have
earned
his
pay
---
which
was
not
large
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
Major
having
disposed
of
all
the
missiles
that
were
convenient
to
his
hand
,
and
having
called
the
Native
so
many
new
names
as
must
have
given
him
great
occasion
to
marvel
at
the
resources
of
the
English
language
,
submitted
to
have
his
cravat
put
on
;
and
being
dressed
,
and
finding
himself
in
a
brisk
flow
of
spirits
after
this
exercise
,
went
downstairs
to
enliven
"
Dombey
"
and
his
right
-
hand
man
.
  
<EOS>
Dombey
was
not
yet
in
the
room
,
but
the
right
-
hand
man
was
there
,
and
his
dental
treasures
were
,
as
usual
,
ready
for
the
Major
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
!
"
said
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
How
have
you
passed
the
time
since
I
had
the
happiness
of
meeting
you
?
<EOS>
Have
you
walked
at
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
saunter
of
barely
half
an
hour
's
duration
,
"
returned
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
so
much
occupied
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Business
,
eh
?
"
said
the
Major
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
variety
of
little
matters
necessary
to
be
gone
through
,
"
replied
Carker
.
"
<EOS>
But
do
you
know
---
this
is
quite
unusual
with
me
,
educated
in
a
distrustful
school
,
and
who
am
not
generally
disposed
to
be
communicative
,
"
he
said
,
breaking
off
,
and
speaking
in
a
charming
tone
of
frankness
---
"
<EOS>
but
I
feel
quite
confidential
with
you
,
Major
Bagstock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
me
honour
,
Sir
,
"
returned
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
then
,
"
pursued
Carker
,
"
that
I
have
not
found
my
friend
---
our
friend
<EOS>
,
I
ought
rather
to
call
him
---
"
  
"
Meaning
Dombey
,
Sir
?
"
cried
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
me
,
Mr
Carker
,
standing
here
!
<EOS>
JB
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
puffy
enough
to
see
,
and
blue
enough
;
and
Mr
Carker
intimated
that
he
had
that
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
see
a
man
,
Sir
,
who
would
go
through
fire
and
water
to
serve
Dombey
,
"
returned
Major
Bagstock
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
smiled
,
and
said
he
was
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
Major
,
"
he
proceeded
:
"
to
resume
where
I
left
off
:
that
I
have
not
found
our
friend
so
attentive
to
business
to
-
day
,
as
usual
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
?
"
observed
the
delighted
Major
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
found
him
a
little
abstracted
,
and
with
this
attention
disposed
to
wander
,
"
said
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
Jove
,
Sir
,
"
cried
the
Major
,
"
there
's
a
lady
in
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
I
begin
to
believe
there
really
is
,
"
returned
Carker
;
"
I
thought
you
might
be
jesting
when
you
seemed
to
hint
at
it
;
for
I
know
you
military
men
---
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
gave
the
horse
's
cough
,
and
shook
his
head
and
shoulders
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
Well
!
<EOS>
we
are
gay
dogs
,
there
's
no
denying
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
seized
Mr
Carker
by
the
button
-
hole
,
and
with
starting
eyes
whispered
in
his
ear
,
that
she
was
a
woman
of
extraordinary
charms
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
That
she
was
a
young
widow
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
That
she
was
of
a
fine
family
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
That
Dombey
was
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
her
,
Sir
,
and
that
it
would
be
a
good
match
on
both
sides
;
for
she
has
beauty
,
blood
,
and
talent
,
and
Dombey
had
fortune
;
and
what
more
could
any
couple
have
?
<EOS>
Hearing
Mr
Dombey
's
footsteps
without
,
the
Major
cut
himself
short
by
saying
,
that
Mr
Carker
would
see
her
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
would
judge
for
himself
;
and
between
his
mental
excitement
,
and
the
exertion
of
saying
all
this
in
wheezy
whispers
,
the
Major
sat
gurgling
in
the
throat
and
watering
at
the
eyes
,
until
dinner
was
ready
.
  
<EOS>
The
Major
,
like
some
other
noble
animals
,
exhibited
himself
to
great
advantage
at
feeding
-
time
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
,
he
shone
resplendent
at
one
end
of
the
table
,
supported
by
the
milder
lustre
of
Mr
Dombey
at
the
other
;
while
Carker
on
one
side
lent
his
ray
to
either
light
,
or
suffered
it
to
merge
into
both
,
as
occasion
arose
.
  
<EOS>
During
the
first
course
or
two
,
the
Major
was
usually
grave
;
for
the
Native
,
in
obedience
to
general
orders
,
secretly
issued
,
collected
every
sauce
and
cruet
round
him
,
and
gave
him
a
great
deal
to
do
,
in
taking
out
the
stoppers
,
and
mixing
up
the
contents
in
his
plate
.
<EOS>
Besides
which
,
the
Native
had
private
zests
and
flavours
on
a
side
-
table
,
with
which
the
Major
daily
scorched
himself
;
to
say
nothing
of
strange
machines
out
of
which
he
spirted
unknown
liquids
into
the
Major
's
drink
.
<EOS>
But
on
this
occasion
,
Major
Bagstock
,
even
amidst
these
many
occupations
,
found
time
to
be
social
;
and
his
sociality
consisted
in
excessive
slyness
for
the
behoof
of
Mr
Carker
,
and
the
betrayal
of
Mr
Dombey
's
state
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dombey
,
"
said
the
Major
,
"
you
do
n't
eat
;
what
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
returned
that
gentleman
,
"
I
am
doing
very
well
;
I
have
no
great
appetite
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Dombey
,
what
's
become
of
it
?
"
asked
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
Where
's
it
gone
?
<EOS>
You
have
n't
left
it
with
our
friends
,
I
'll
swear
,
for
I
can
answer
for
their
having
none
to
-
day
at
luncheon
.
<EOS>
I
can
answer
for
one
of
'em
,
at
least
:
I
wo
n't
say
which
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
the
Major
winked
at
Carker
,
and
became
so
frightfully
sly
,
that
his
dark
attendant
was
obliged
to
pat
him
on
the
back
,
without
orders
,
or
he
would
probably
have
disappeared
under
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
later
stage
of
the
dinner
:
that
is
to
say
,
when
the
Native
stood
at
the
Major
's
elbow
ready
to
serve
the
first
bottle
of
champagne
:
the
Major
became
still
slyer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fill
this
to
the
brim
,
you
scoundrel
,
"
said
the
Major
,
holding
up
his
glass
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fill
Mr
Carker
's
to
the
brim
too
.
<EOS>
And
Mr
Dombey
's
too
.
<EOS>
By
Gad
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
the
Major
,
winking
at
his
new
friend
,
while
Mr
Dombey
looked
into
his
plate
with
a
conscious
air
,
"
we
'll
consecrate
this
glass
of
wine
to
a
Divinity
whom
Joe
is
proud
to
know
,
and
at
a
distance
humbly
and
reverently
to
admire
.
<EOS>
Edith
,
"
said
the
Major
,
"
is
her
name
;
angelic
Edith
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
angelic
Edith
!
"
cried
the
smiling
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Edith
,
by
all
means
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
The
entrance
of
the
waiters
with
new
dishes
caused
the
Major
to
be
slyer
yet
,
but
in
a
more
serious
vein
.
<EOS>
"
For
though
among
ourselves
,
Joe
Bagstock
mingles
jest
and
earnest
on
this
subject
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Major
,
laying
his
finger
on
his
lips
,
and
speaking
half
apart
to
Carker
,
"
he
holds
that
name
too
sacred
to
be
made
the
property
of
these
fellows
,
or
of
any
fellows
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
,
Sir
,
while
they
are
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
respectful
and
becoming
on
the
Major
's
part
,
and
Mr
Dombey
plainly
felt
it
so
.
<EOS>
Although
embarrassed
in
his
own
frigid
way
,
by
the
Major
's
allusions
,
Mr
Dombey
has
no
objection
to
such
rallying
,
it
was
clear
,
but
rather
courted
it
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
Major
had
been
pretty
near
the
truth
,
when
he
had
divined
that
morning
that
the
great
man
who
was
too
haughty
formally
to
consult
with
,
or
confide
in
his
prime
minister
,
on
such
a
matter
,
yet
wished
him
to
be
fully
possessed
of
it
.
<EOS>
Let
this
be
how
it
may
,
he
often
glanced
at
Mr
Carker
while
the
Major
plied
his
light
artillery
,
and
seemed
watchful
of
its
effect
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
Major
,
having
secured
an
attentive
listener
,
and
a
smiler
who
had
not
his
match
in
all
the
world
---
"
in
short
,
a
de
-
vilish
intelligent
and
agreeable
fellow
,
"
as
he
often
afterwards
declared
---
was
not
going
to
let
him
off
with
a
little
slyness
personal
to
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
on
the
removal
of
the
cloth
,
the
Major
developed
himself
as
a
choice
spirit
in
the
broader
and
more
comprehensive
range
of
narrating
regimental
stories
,
and
cracking
regimental
jokes
,
which
he
did
with
such
prodigal
exuberance
,
that
Carker
was
(
or
feigned
to
be
)
quite
exhausted
with
laughter
and
admiration
:
while
Mr
Dombey
looked
on
over
his
starched
cravat
,
like
the
Major
's
proprietor
,
or
like
a
stately
showman
who
was
glad
to
see
his
bear
dancing
well
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
Major
was
too
hoarse
with
meat
and
drink
,
and
the
display
of
his
social
powers
,
to
render
himself
intelligible
any
longer
,
they
adjourned
to
coffee
.
<EOS>
After
which
,
the
Major
inquired
of
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
,
with
little
apparent
hope
of
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
if
he
played
picquet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
play
picquet
a
little
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Backgammon
,
perhaps
?
"
observed
the
Major
,
hesitating
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
play
backgammon
a
little
too
,
"
replied
the
man
of
teeth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Carker
plays
at
all
games
,
I
believe
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
laying
himself
on
a
sofa
like
a
man
of
wood
,
without
a
hinge
or
a
joint
in
him
;
"
and
plays
them
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
sooth
,
he
played
the
two
in
question
,
to
such
perfection
,
that
the
Major
was
astonished
,
and
asked
him
,
at
random
,
if
he
played
chess
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
play
chess
a
little
,
"
answered
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
sometimes
played
,
and
won
a
game
---
it
's
a
mere
trick
---
without
seeing
the
board
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
Gad
,
Sir
!
"
said
the
Major
,
staring
,
<EOS>
"
you
are
a
contrast
to
Dombey
,
who
plays
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
He
!
"
returned
the
Manager
.
<EOS>
"
He
has
never
had
occasion
to
acquire
such
little
arts
.
<EOS>
To
men
like
me
,
they
are
sometimes
useful
.
<EOS>
As
at
present
,
Major
Bagstock
,
when
they
enable
me
to
take
a
hand
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
might
be
only
the
false
mouth
,
so
smooth
and
wide
;
and
yet
there
seemed
to
lurk
beneath
the
humility
and
subserviency
of
this
short
speech
,
a
something
like
a
snarl
;
and
,
for
a
moment
,
one
might
have
thought
that
the
white
teeth
were
prone
to
bite
the
hand
they
fawned
upon
.
<EOS>
But
the
Major
thought
nothing
about
it
;
and
Mr
Dombey
lay
meditating
with
his
eyes
half
shut
,
during
the
whole
of
the
play
,
which
lasted
until
bed
-
time
.
  
<EOS>
By
that
time
,
Mr
Carker
,
though
the
winner
,
had
mounted
high
into
the
Major
's
good
opinion
,
insomuch
that
when
he
left
the
Major
at
his
own
room
before
going
to
bed
,
the
Major
as
a
special
attention
,
sent
the
Native
---
who
always
rested
on
a
mattress
spread
upon
the
ground
at
his
master
's
door
---
along
the
gallery
,
to
light
him
to
his
room
in
state
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
faint
blur
on
the
surface
of
the
mirror
in
Mr
Carker
's
chamber
,
and
its
reflection
was
,
perhaps
,
a
false
one
.
<EOS>
But
it
showed
,
that
night
,
the
image
of
a
man
,
who
saw
,
in
his
fancy
,
a
crowd
of
people
slumbering
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
,
like
the
poor
Native
at
his
master
's
door
:
who
picked
his
way
among
them
:
looking
down
,
maliciously
enough
:
but
trod
upon
no
upturned
face
---
as
yet
.

<EOS>
Deeper
Shadows
 
<EOS>
Mr
CARKER
the
Manger
rose
with
the
lark
,
and
went
out
,
walking
in
the
summer
day
.
<EOS>
His
meditations
---
and
he
meditated
with
contracted
brows
while
he
strolled
along
---
hardly
seemed
to
soar
as
high
as
the
lark
,
or
to
mount
in
that
direction
;
rather
they
kept
close
to
their
nest
upon
the
earth
,
and
looked
about
,
among
the
dust
and
worms
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
not
a
bird
in
the
air
,
singing
unseen
,
farther
beyond
the
reach
of
human
eye
than
Mr
Carker
's
thoughts
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
face
so
perfectly
under
control
,
that
few
could
say
more
,
in
distinct
terms
,
of
its
expression
,
than
that
it
smiled
or
that
it
pondered
.
<EOS>
It
pondered
now
,
intently
.
<EOS>
As
the
lark
rose
higher
,
he
sank
deeper
in
thought
.
<EOS>
As
the
lark
poured
out
her
melody
clearer
and
stronger
,
he
fell
into
a
graver
and
profounder
silence
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
when
the
lark
came
headlong
down
,
with
an
accumulating
stream
of
song
,
and
dropped
among
the
green
wheat
near
him
,
rippling
in
the
breath
of
the
morning
like
a
river
,
he
sprang
up
from
his
reverie
,
and
looked
round
with
a
sudden
smile
,
as
courteous
and
as
soft
as
if
he
had
had
numerous
observers
to
propitiate
;
nor
did
he
relapse
,
after
being
thus
awakened
;
but
clearing
his
face
,
like
one
who
bethought
himself
that
it
might
otherwise
wrinkle
and
tell
tales
,
went
smiling
on
,
as
if
for
practice
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
with
an
eye
to
first
impressions
,
Mr
Carker
was
very
carefully
and
trimly
dressed
,
that
morning
.
<EOS>
Though
always
somewhat
formal
,
in
his
dress
,
in
intimation
of
the
great
man
whom
he
served
,
he
stopped
short
of
the
extent
of
Mr
Dombey
's
stiffness
:
at
once
perhaps
because
he
knew
it
to
be
ludicrous
,
and
because
in
doing
so
he
found
another
means
of
expressing
his
sense
of
the
difference
and
distance
between
them
.
<EOS>
Some
people
quoted
him
indeed
,
in
this
respect
,
as
a
pointed
commentary
,
and
not
a
flattering
one
,
on
his
icy
patron
---
but
the
world
is
prone
to
misconstruction
,
and
Mr
Carker
was
not
accountable
for
its
bad
propensity
.
  
<EOS>
Clean
and
florid
:
with
his
light
complexion
,
fading
as
it
were
,
in
the
sun
,
and
his
dainty
step
enhancing
the
softness
of
the
turf
:
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
strolled
about
meadows
,
and
green
lanes
,
and
glided
among
avenues
of
trees
,
until
it
was
time
to
return
to
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Taking
a
nearer
way
back
,
Mr
Carker
pursued
,
airing
his
teeth
,
and
said
aloud
as
he
did
so
,
"
Now
to
see
the
second
Mrs
Dombey
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
strolled
beyond
the
town
,
and
re
-
entered
it
by
a
pleasant
walk
,
where
there
was
a
deep
shade
of
leafy
trees
,
and
where
there
were
a
few
benches
here
and
there
for
those
who
chose
to
rest
.
<EOS>
It
not
being
a
place
of
general
resort
at
any
hour
,
and
wearing
at
that
time
of
the
still
morning
the
air
of
being
quite
deserted
and
retired
,
Mr
Carker
had
it
,
or
thought
he
had
it
,
all
to
himself
.
<EOS>
So
,
with
the
whim
of
an
idle
man
,
to
whom
there
yet
remained
twenty
minutes
for
reaching
a
destination
easily
accessible
in
ten
,
Mr
Carker
threaded
the
great
boles
of
the
trees
,
and
went
passing
in
and
out
,
before
this
one
and
behind
that
,
weaving
a
chain
of
footsteps
on
the
dewy
ground
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
found
he
was
mistaken
in
supposing
<EOS>
there
was
no
one
in
the
grove
,
for
as
he
softly
rounded
the
trunk
of
one
large
tree
,
on
which
the
obdurate
bark
was
knotted
and
overlapped
like
the
hide
of
a
rhinoceros
or
some
kindred
monster
of
the
ancient
days
before
the
Flood
,
he
saw
an
unexpected
figure
sitting
on
a
bench
near
at
hand
,
about
which
,
in
another
moment
,
he
would
have
wound
the
chain
he
was
making
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
that
of
a
lady
,
elegantly
dressed
and
very
handsome
,
whose
dark
proud
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
ground
,
and
in
whom
some
passion
or
struggle
was
raging
.
<EOS>
For
as
she
sat
looking
down
,
she
held
a
corner
of
her
under
lip
within
her
mouth
,
her
bosom
heaved
,
her
nostril
quivered
,
her
head
trembled
,
indignant
tears
were
on
her
cheek
,
and
her
foot
was
set
upon
the
moss
as
though
she
would
have
crushed
it
into
nothing
.
<EOS>
And
yet
almost
the
self
-
same
glance
that
showed
him
this
,
showed
him
the
self
-
same
lady
rising
with
a
scornful
air
of
weariness
and
lassitude
,
and
turning
away
with
nothing
expressed
in
face
or
figure
but
careless
beauty
and
imperious
disdain
.
  
<EOS>
A
withered
and
very
ugly
old
woman
,
dressed
not
so
much
like
a
gipsy
as
like
any
of
that
medley
race
of
vagabonds
who
tramp
about
the
country
,
begging
,
and
stealing
,
and
tinkering
,
and
weaving
rushes
,
by
turns
,
or
all
together
,
had
been
observing
the
lady
,
too
;
for
,
as
she
rose
,
this
second
figure
strangely
confronting
the
first
,
scrambled
up
from
the
ground
---
out
of
it
,
it
almost
appeared
---
and
stood
in
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
tell
your
fortune
,
my
pretty
lady
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
munching
with
her
jaws
,
as
if
the
Death
's
Head
beneath
her
yellow
skin
were
impatient
to
get
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
tell
it
for
myself
,
"
was
the
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
pretty
lady
;
but
not
right
.
<EOS>
You
did
n't
tell
it
right
when
you
were
sitting
there
.
<EOS>
I
see
you
!
<EOS>
Give
me
a
piece
of
silver
,
pretty
lady
,
and
I
'll
tell
your
fortune
true
.
<EOS>
There
's
riches
,
pretty
lady
,
in
your
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
returned
the
lady
,
passing
her
with
a
dark
smile
,
and
a
proud
step
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
it
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
give
me
nothing
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
give
me
nothing
to
tell
your
fortune
,
pretty
lady
?
<EOS>
How
much
will
you
give
me
not
to
tell
it
,
then
?
<EOS>
Give
me
something
,
or
I
'll
call
it
after
you
!
"
<EOS>
croaked
the
old
woman
,
passionately
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
,
whom
the
lady
was
about
to
pass
close
,
slinking
against
his
tree
as
she
crossed
to
gain
the
path
,
advanced
so
as
to
meet
her
,
and
pulling
off
his
hat
as
she
went
by
,
bade
the
old
women
hold
her
peace
.
<EOS>
The
lady
acknowledged
his
interference
with
an
inclination
of
the
head
,
and
went
her
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
give
me
something
then
,
or
I
'll
call
it
after
her
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
the
old
woman
,
throwing
up
her
arms
,
and
pressing
forward
against
his
outstretched
hand
.
"
Or
come
,
"
she
added
,
dropping
her
voice
suddenly
,
looking
at
him
earnestly
,
and
seeming
in
a
moment
to
forget
the
object
of
her
wrath
,
"
give
me
something
,
or
I
'll
call
it
after
you
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
After
me
,
old
lady
!
"
returned
the
Manager
,
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
woman
,
steadfast
in
her
scrutiny
,
and
holding
out
her
shrivelled
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
know
?
"
demanded
Carker
,
throwing
her
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
who
the
handsome
lady
is
?
"
  
<EOS>
Munching
like
that
sailor
's
wife
of
yore
,
who
had
chestnuts
in
her
lap
,
and
scowling
like
the
witch
who
asked
for
some
in
vain
,
the
old
woman
picked
the
shilling
up
,
and
going
backwards
,
like
a
crab
,
or
like
a
heap
of
crabs
:
for
her
alternately
expanding
and
contracting
hands
might
have
represented
two
of
that
species
,
and
her
creeping
face
,
some
half
-
a
-
dozen
more
:
crouched
on
the
veinous
root
of
an
old
tree
,
pulled
out
a
short
black
pipe
from
within
the
crown
of
her
bonnet
,
lighted
it
with
a
match
,
and
smoked
in
silence
,
looking
fixedly
at
her
questioner
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
laughed
,
and
turned
upon
his
heel
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
said
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
One
child
dead
,
and
one
child
living
:
<EOS>
one
wife
dead
,
and
one
wife
coming
.
<EOS>
Go
and
meet
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
spite
of
himself
,
the
Manager
looked
round
again
,
and
stopped
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
,
who
had
not
removed
her
pipe
,
and
was
munching
and
mumbling
while
she
smoked
,
as
if
in
conversation
with
in
invisible
familiar
,
pointed
with
her
finger
in
the
direction
he
was
going
,
and
laughed
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
was
that
you
said
,
Bedlamite
?
"
<EOS>
he
demanded
.
  
<EOS>
The
woman
mumbled
,
and
chattered
,
and
smoked
,
and
still
pointed
before
him
;
but
remained
silent
.
<EOS>
Muttering
a
farewell
that
was
not
complimentary
,
Mr
Carker
pursued
his
way
;
but
as
he
turned
out
of
that
place
,
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
root
of
the
old
tree
,
he
could
yet
see
the
finger
pointing
before
him
,
and
thought
he
heard
the
woman
screaming
,
"
Go
and
meet
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
Preparations
for
a
choice
repast
were
completed
,
he
found
,
at
the
hotel
;
and
Mr
Dombey
,
and
the
Major
,
and
the
breakfast
,
were
awaiting
the
ladies
.
<EOS>
Individual
constitution
has
much
to
do
with
the
development
of
such
facts
,
no
doubt
;
but
in
this
case
,
appetite
carried
it
hollow
over
the
tender
passion
;
Mr
Dombey
being
very
cool
and
collected
,
and
the
Major
fretting
and
fuming
in
a
state
of
violent
heat
and
irritation
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
door
was
thrown
open
by
the
Native
,
and
,
after
a
pause
,
occupied
by
her
languishing
along
the
gallery
,
a
very
blooming
,
but
not
very
youthful
lady
,
appeared
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mr
Dombey
,
"
said
the
lady
,
"
I
am
afraid
we
are
late
,
but
Edith
has
been
out
already
looking
for
a
favourable
point
of
view
for
a
sketch
,
and
kept
me
waiting
for
her
.
<EOS>
Falsest
of
Majors

"
giving
him
her
little
finger
,
"
how
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
let
me
gratify
my
friend
Carker
:
"
Mr
Dombey
unconsciously
emphasised
the
word
friend
,
as
saying
"
no
really
;
I
do
allow
him
to
take
credit
for
that
distinction
;
"
"
by
presenting
him
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
heard
me
mention
Mr
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
charmed
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
graciously
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
was
charmed
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
Would
he
have
been
more
charmed
on
Mr
Dombey
's
behalf
,
if
Mrs
Skewton
had
been
(
as
he
at
first
supposed
her
)
<EOS>
the
Edith
whom
they
had
toasted
over
night
?
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
where
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
is
Edith
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mrs
Skewton
,
looking
round
.
"
<EOS>
Still
at
the
door
,
giving
Withers
orders
about
the
mounting
of
those
drawings
!
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr
Dombey
,
will
you
have
the
kindness
---
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
was
already
gone
to
seek
her
.
<EOS>
Next
moment
he
returned
,
bearing
on
his
arm
the
same
elegantly
dressed
and
very
handsome
lady
whom
Mr
Carker
had
encountered
underneath
the
trees
.
  
<EOS>
"
Carker
---
"
began
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
But
their
recognition
of
each
other
was
so
manifest
,
that
Mr
Dombey
stopped
surprised
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
obliged
to
the
gentleman
,
"
said
Edith
,
with
a
stately
bend
,
"
for
sparing
me
some
annoyance
from
an
importunate
beggar
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
obliged
to
my
good
fortune
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
bowing
low
,
"
for
the
opportunity
of
rendering
so
slight
a
service
to
one
whose
servant
I
am
proud
to
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
her
eye
rested
on
him
for
an
instant
,
and
then
lighted
on
the
ground
,
he
saw
in
its
bright
and
searching
glance
a
suspicion
that
he
had
not
come
up
at
the
moment
of
his
interference
,
but
had
secretly
observed
her
sooner
.
<EOS>
As
he
saw
that
,
she
saw
in
his
eye
that
her
distrust
was
not
without
foundation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Really
,
"
cried
Mrs
Skewton
,
who
had
taken
this
opportunity
of
inspecting
Mr
Carker
through
her
glass
,
and
satisfying
herself
(
as
she
lisped
audibly
to
the
Major
)
that
he
was
all
heart
;
"
really
now
,
this
is
one
of
the
most
enchanting
coincidences
that
I
ever
heard
of
.
<EOS>
The
idea
!
<EOS>
My
dearest
Edith
,
there
is
such
an
obvious
destiny
in
it
,
that
really
one
might
almost
be
induced
to
cross
one
's
arms
upon
one
's
frock
,
and
say
,
like
those
wicked
Turks
,
there
is
no
What's
-
his
-
name
but
Thingummy
,
and
What
-
<EOS>
you
-
may
-
call
-
it
is
his
prophet
!
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
deigned
no
revision
of
this
extraordinary
quotation
from
the
Koran
,
but
Mr
Dombey
felt
it
necessary
to
offer
a
few
polite
remarks
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
gives
me
great
pleasure
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
with
cumbrous
gallantry
,
"
that
a
gentleman
so
nearly
connected
with
myself
as
Carker
is
,
should
have
had
the
honour
and
happiness
of
rendering
the
least
assistance
to
Mrs
Granger
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
bowed
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
But
it
gives
me
some
pain
,
and
it
occasions
me
to
be
really
envious
of
Carker
;
"
he
unconsciously
laid
stress
on
these
words
,
as
sensible
that
they
must
appear
to
involve
a
very
surprising
proposition
;
"
envious
of
Carker
,
that
I
had
not
that
honour
and
that
happiness
myself
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
bowed
again
.
<EOS>
Edith
,
saving
for
a
curl
of
her
lip
,
was
motionless
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
the
Lord
,
Sir
,
"
cried
the
Major
,
bursting
into
speech
at
sight
of
the
waiter
,
who
was
come
to
announce
breakfast
,
"
it
's
an
extraordinary
thing
to
me
that
no
one
can
have
the
honour
and
happiness
of
shooting
all
such
beggars
through
the
head
without
being
brought
to
book
for
it
.
<EOS>
But
here
's
an
arm
for
Mrs
Granger
if
she
'll
do
JB
the
honour
to
accept
it
;
and
the
greatest
service
Joe
can
render
you
,
ma'am
,
just
now
,
is
,
to
lead
you
in
to
table
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
,
the
Major
gave
his
arm
to
Edith
;
Mr
Dombey
led
the
way
with
Mrs
Skewton
;
Mr
Carker
went
last
,
smiling
on
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
rejoiced
,
Mr
Carker
,
"
said
the
lady
-
mother
,
at
breakfast
,
after
another
approving
survey
of
him
through
her
glass
,
"
that
you
have
timed
your
visit
so
happily
,
as
to
go
with
us
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
most
enchanting
expedition
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Any
expedition
would
be
enchanting
in
such
society
,
"
returned
Carker
;
"
but
I
believe
it
is
,
in
itself
,
full
of
interest
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
cried
Mrs
Skewton
,
with
a
faded
little
scream
of
rapture
,
"
the
Castle
is
charming
!
<EOS>
---
associations
of
the
Middle
Ages
---
and
all
that
---
which
is
so
truly
exquisite
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
doat
upon
the
Middle
Ages
,
Mr
Carker
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
much
,
indeed
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Such
charming
times
!
"
cried
Cleopatra
.
"
<EOS>
So
full
of
faith!So
vigorous
and
forcible
!
<EOS>
So
picturesque
!
<EOS>
So
perfectly
removed
from
commonplace
!
<EOS>
Oh
dear
!
<EOS>
If
they
would
only
leave
us
a
little
more
of
the
poetry
of
existence
in
these
terrible
days
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
was
looking
sharp
after
Mr
Dombey
all
the
time
she
said
this
,
who
was
looking
at
Edith
:
who
was
listening
,
but
who
never
lifted
up
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
dreadfully
real
,
Mr
Carker
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
;
"
are
we
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
Few
people
has
less
reason
to
complain
of
their
reality
than
Cleopatra
,
who
had
as
much
that
was
false
about
her
as
could
well
go
to
the
composition
of
anybody
with
a
real
individual
existence
.
<EOS>
But
Mr
Carker
commiserated
our
reality
nevertheless
,
and
agreed
that
we
were
very
hardly
used
in
that
regard
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pictures
at
the
Castle
,
quite
divine
!
"
said
Cleopatra
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
doat
upon
pictures
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
with
solemn
encouragement
of
his
Manager
,
"
that
Carker
has
a
very
good
taste
for
pictures
;
quite
a
natural
power
of
appreciating
them
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
very
creditable
artist
himself
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
delighted
,
I
am
sure
,
with
Mrs
Granger
's
taste
and
skill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Damme
,
Sir
!
"
cried
Major
Bagstock
,
"
my
opinion
is
,
that
you
're
the
admirable
Carker
,
and
can
do
anything
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
smiled
Carker
,
with
humility
,
"
you
are
much
too
sanguine
,
Major
Bagstock
.
<EOS>
I
can
do
very
little
.
<EOS>
But
Mr
Dombey
is
so
generous
in
his
estimation
of
any
trivial
accomplishment
<EOS>
a
man
like
myself
may
find
it
almost
necessary
to
acquire
,
and
to
which
,
in
his
very
different
sphere
,
he
is
far
superior
,
that
---
"
Mr
Carker
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
deprecating
further
praise
,
and
said
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
Edith
never
raised
her
eyes
,
unless
to
glance
towards
her
mother
when
that
lady
's
fervent
spirit
shone
forth
in
words
.
<EOS>
But
as
Carker
ceased
,
she
looked
at
Mr
Dombey
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
only
;
but
with
a
transient
gleam
of
scornful
wonder
on
her
face
,
not
lost
on
one
observer
,
who
was
smiling
round
the
board
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
caught
the
dark
eyelash
in
its
descent
,
and
took
the
opportunity
of
arresting
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
to
Warwick
often
,
unfortunately
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Several
times
"
  
"
The
visit
will
be
tedious
to
you
,
I
am
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
no
;
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
You
are
like
your
cousin
Feenix
,
my
dearest
Edith
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
been
to
Warwick
Castle
fifty
times
,
if
he
has
been
there
once
;
yet
if
he
came
to
Leamington
to
-
morrow
---
I
wish
he
would
,
dear
angel
!
<EOS>
---
he
would
make
his
fifty
-
second
visit
next
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
all
enthusiastic
,
are
we
not
,
mama
?
"
<EOS>
said
Edith
,
with
a
cold
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Too
much
so
,
for
our
peace
,
perhaps
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
her
mother
;
"
but
we
wo
n't
complain
.
<EOS>
Our
own
emotions
are
our
recompense
.
<EOS>
If
,
as
your
cousin
Feenix
says
,
the
sword
wears
out
the
what's
-
its
-
name
---
"
  
"
The
scabbard
,
perhaps
,
"
said
Edith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
---
a
little
too
fast
,
it
is
because
it
is
bright
and
glowing
,
you
know
,
my
dearest
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
heaved
a
gentle
sigh
,
supposed
to
cast
a
shadow
on
the
surface
of
that
dagger
of
lath
,
whereof
her
susceptible
bosom
was
the
sheath
:
and
leaning
her
head
on
one
side
,
in
the
Cleopatra
manner
,
looked
with
pensive
affection
on
her
darling
child
.
  
<EOS>
Edith
had
turned
her
face
towards
Mr
Dombey
when
he
first
addressed
her
,
and
had
remained
in
that
attitude
,
while
speaking
to
her
mother
,
and
while
her
mother
spoke
to
her
,
as
though
offering
him
her
attention
,
if
he
had
anything
more
to
say
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
the
manner
of
this
simple
courtesy
:
almost
defiant
,
and
giving
it
the
character
of
being
rendered
on
compulsion
,
or
as
a
matter
of
traffic
to
which
she
was
a
reluctant
party
:
again
not
lost
upon
that
same
observer
who
was
smiling
round
the
board
.
<EOS>
It
set
him
thinking
of
her
as
he
had
first
seen
her
,
when
she
had
believed
herself
to
be
alone
among
the
trees
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
having
nothing
else
to
say
,
proposed
---
the
breakfast
being
now
finished
,
and
the
Major
gorged
,
like
any
Boa
Constrictor
---
that
they
should
start
.
<EOS>
A
barouche
being
in
waiting
,
according
to
the
orders
of
that
gentleman
,
the
two
ladies
,
the
Major
and
himself
,
took
their
seats
in
it
;
the
Native
and
the
wan
page
mounted
the
box
,
Mr
Towlinson
being
left
behind
;
and
Mr
Carker
,
on
horseback
,
brought
up
the
rear
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
cantered
behind
the
carriage
,
at
the
distance
of
a
hundred
yards
or
so
,
and
watched
it
,
during
all
the
ride
,
as
if
he
were
a
cat
,
indeed
,
and
its
four
occupants
,
mice
.
<EOS>
Whether
he
looked
to
one
side
of
the
road
,
or
to
the
other
---
over
distant
landscape
,
with
its
smooth
undulations
,
wind
-
mills
,
corn
,
grass
,
bean
fields
,
wild
-
flowers
,
farm
-
yards
,
hayricks
,
and
the
spire
among
the
wood
---
or
upwards
in
the
sunny
air
,
where
butterflies
were
sporting
round
his
head
,
and
birds
were
pouring
out
their
songs
---
or
downward
,
where
the
shadows
of
the
branches
interlaced
,
and
made
a
trembling
carpet
on
the
road
---
or
onward
,
where
the
overhanging
trees
formed
aisles
and
arches
,
dim
with
the
softened
light
that
steeped
through
leaves
---
<EOS>
one
corner
of
his
eye
was
ever
on
the
formal
head
of
Mr
Dombey
,
addressed
towards
him
,
and
the
feather
in
the
bonnet
,
drooping
so
neglectfully
and
scornfully
between
them
;
much
as
he
had
seen
the
haughty
eyelids
droop
;
not
least
so
,
when
the
face
met
that
now
fronting
it
.
<EOS>
Once
,
and
once
only
,
did
his
wary
glance
release
these
objects
;
and
that
was
,
when
a
leap
over
a
low
hedge
,
and
a
gallop
across
a
field
,
enabled
him
to
anticipate
the
carriage
coming
by
the
road
,
and
to
be
standing
ready
,
at
the
journey
's
end
,
to
hand
the
ladies
out
.
<EOS>
Then
,
and
but
then
,
he
met
her
glance
for
an
instant
in
her
first
surprise
;
but
when
he
touched
her
,
in
alighting
,
with
his
soft
white
hand
,
it
overlooked
him
altogether
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
was
bent
on
taking
charge
of
Mr
Carker
herself
,
and
showing
him
the
beauties
of
the
Castle
.
<EOS>
She
was
determined
to
have
his
arm
,
and
the
Major
's
too
.
<EOS>
It
would
do
that
incorrigible
creature
:
<EOS>
who
was
the
most
barbarous
infidel
in
point
of
poetry
:
good
to
be
in
such
company
.
<EOS>
This
chance
arrangement
left
Mr
Dombey
at
liberty
to
escort
Edith
:
which
he
did
,
stalking
before
them
through
the
apartments
with
a
gentlemanly
solemnity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Those
darling
byegone
times
,
Mr
Carker
,
"
said
Cleopatra
,
"
with
their
delicious
fortresses
,
and
their
dear
old
dungeons
,
and
their
delightful
places
of
torture
,
and
their
romantic
vengeances
,
and
their
picturesque
assaults
and
sieges
,
and
everything
that
makes
life
truly
charming
!
<EOS>
How
dreadfully
we
have
degenerated
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
we
have
fallen
off
deplorably
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
The
peculiarity
of
their
conversation
was
,
that
Mrs
Skewton
,
in
spite
of
her
ecstasies
,
and
Mr
Carker
,
in
spite
of
his
urbanity
,
were
both
intent
on
watching
Mr
Dombey
and
Edith
.
<EOS>
With
all
their
conversational
endowments
,
they
spoke
somewhat
distractedly
,
and
at
random
in
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
no
Faith
left
,
positively
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
advancing
her
shrivelled
ear
;
for
Mr
Dombey
was
saying
something
to
Edith
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
no
Faith
in
he
<EOS>
dear
old
Barons
,
who
were
the
most
delightful
creatures
---
or
in
the
dear
old
Priests
,
who
were
the
most
warlike
of
men
---
or
even
in
the
days
of
that
inestimable
Queen
Bess
,
upon
the
wall
there
,
which
were
so
extremely
golden
.
<EOS>
Dear
creature
!
<EOS>
She

I

Eighth

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
admire
him
very
much
,
"
said
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
bluff
!
"
cried
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
was
n't
he
?
<EOS>
So
burly
.
<EOS>
So
truly
English
.
<EOS>
Such
a
picture
,
too
,
he
makes
,
with
his
dear
little
peppy
eyes
,
and
his
benevolent
chin
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
ma'am
!
"
said
Carker
,
stopping
short
;
"
but
if
you
speak
of
pictures
,
there
's
a
composition
!
<EOS>
What
gallery
in
the
world
can
produce
the
counterpart
of
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
smiling
gentleman
thus
spake
,
he
pointed
through
a
doorway
to
where
Mr
Dombey
and
Edith
were
standing
alone
in
the
centre
of
another
room
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
not
interchanging
a
word
or
a
look
.
<EOS>
Standing
together
,
arm
in
arm
,
they
had
the
appearance
of
being
more
divided
than
if
seas
had
rolled
between
them
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
difference
even
in
the
pride
of
the
two
,
that
removed
them
farther
from
each
other
,
than
if
one
had
been
the
proudest
and
the
other
the
humblest
specimen
of
humanity
in
all
creation
.
<EOS>
He
,
self
-
important
,
unbending
,
formal
,
austere
.
<EOS>
She
,
lovely
and
graceful
in
an
uncommon
degree
,
but
totally
regardless
of
herself
and
him
and
everything
around
,
and
spurning
her
own
attractions
with
her
haughty
brow
and
lip
,
as
if
they
were
a
badge
or
livery
she
hated
.
<EOS>
So
unmatched
were
they
,
and
opposed
,
so
forced
and
linked
together
by
a
chain
which
adverse
hazard
and
mischance
had
forged
:
that
fancy
might
have
imagined
the
pictures
on
the
walls
around
them
,
startled
by
the
unnatural
conjunction
,
and
observant
of
it
in
their
several
expressions
.
<EOS>
Grim
knights
and
warriors
looked
scowling
on
them
.
<EOS>
A
churchman
,
with
his
hand
upraised
,
denounced
the
mockery
of
such
a
couple
coming
to
God
's
altar
.
<EOS>
Quiet
waters
in
landscapes
,
with
the
sun
reflected
in
their
depths
,
asked
,
if
better
means
of
escape
were
not
at
hand
,
was
there
no
drowning
left
?
<EOS>
Ruins
cried
,
"
Look
here
,
and
see
what
We
are
,
wedded
to
uncongenial
Time
!
"
<EOS>
Animals
,
opposed
by
nature
,
worried
one
another
,
as
a
moral
to
them
.
<EOS>
Loves
and
Cupids
took
to
flight
afraid
,
and
Martyrdom
had
no
such
torment
in
its
painted
history
of
suffering
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
Mrs
Skewton
was
so
charmed
by
the
sight
to
which
Mr
Carker
invoked
her
attention
,
that
she
could
not
refrain
from
saying
,
half
aloud
,
how
sweet
,
how
very
full
of
soul
it
was
!
<EOS>
Edith
,
overhearing
,
looked
round
,
and
flushed
indignant
scarlet
to
her
hair
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Edith
knows
I
was
admiring
her
!
"
said
Cleopatra
,
tapping
her
,
almost
timidly
,
on
the
back
with
her
parasol
.
<EOS>
"
Sweet
pet
!
"
  
<EOS>
Again
Mr
Carker
saw
the
strife
he
had
witnessed
so
unexpectedly
among
the
trees
.
<EOS>
Again
he
saw
the
haughty
languor
and
indifference
come
over
it
,
and
hide
it
like
a
cloud
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
raise
her
eyes
to
him
;
but
with
a
slight
peremptory
motion
of
them
,
seemed
to
bid
her
mother
come
near
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
thought
it
expedient
to
understand
the
hint
,
and
advancing
quickly
,
with
her
two
cavaliers
,
kept
near
her
daughter
from
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
now
,
having
nothing
to
distract
his
attention
,
began
to
discourse
upon
the
pictures
and
to
select
the
best
,
and
point
them
out
to
Mr
Dombey
:
speaking
with
his
usual
familiar
recognition
of
Mr
Dombey
's
greatness
,
and
rendering
homage
by
adjusting
his
eye
-
glass
for
him
,
or
finding
out
the
right
place
in
his
catalogue
,
or
holding
his
stick
,
or
the
like
.
<EOS>
These
services
did
not
so
much
originate
with
Mr
Carker
,
in
truth
,
as
with
Mr
Dombey
himself
,
who
was
apt
to
assert
his
chieftainship
by
saying
,
with
subdued
authority
,
and
in
an
easy
way
---
for
him
---
"
Here
,
Carker
,
have
the
goodness
to
assist
me
,
will
you
?
"
<EOS>
which
the
smiling
gentleman
always
did
with
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
They
made
the
tour
of
the
pictures
,
the
walls
,
crow
's
nest
,
and
so
forth
;
and
as
they
were
still
one
little
party
,
and
the
Major
was
rather
in
the
shade
:
being
sleepy
during
the
process
of
digestion
:
Mr
Carker
became
communicative
and
agreeable
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
he
addressed
himself
for
the
most
part
to
Mrs
Skewton
;
but
as
that
sensitive
lady
was
in
such
ecstasies
with
the
works
of
art
,
after
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
,
that
she
could
do
nothing
but
yawn
(
they
were
such
perfect
inspirations
,
she
observed
as
a
reason
for
that
mark
of
rapture
)
,
he
transferred
his
attentions
to
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
said
little
beyond
an
occasional
"
Very
true
,
Carker
,
"
or
"
Indeed
,
Carker
,
"
but
he
tacitly
encouraged
Carker
to
proceed
,
and
inwardly
approved
of
his
behaviour
very
much
:
deeming
it
as
well
that
somebody
should
talk
,
and
thinking
that
his
remarks
,
which
were
,
as
one
might
say
,
a
branch
of
the
parent
establishment
,
might
amuse
Mrs
Granger
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
,
who
possessed
an
excellent
discretion
,
never
took
the
liberty
of
addressing
that
lady
,
direct
;
but
she
seemed
to
listen
,
though
she
never
looked
at
him
;
and
once
or
twice
,
when
he
was
emphatic
in
his
peculiar
humility
,
the
twilight
smile
stole
over
her
face
,
not
as
a
light
,
but
as
a
deep
black
shadow
.
  
<EOS>
Warwick
Castle
being
at
length
pretty
well
exhausted
,
and
the
Major
very
much
so
:
to
say
nothing
of
Mrs
Skewton
,
whose
peculiar
demonstrations
of
delight
had
become
very
frequent
indeed
:
the
carriage
was
again
put
in
requisition
,
and
they
rode
to
several
admired
points
of
view
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
ceremoniously
observed
of
one
of
these
,
that
a
sketch
,
however
slight
,
from
the
fair
hand
of
Mrs
Granger
,
would
be
a
remembrance
to
him
of
that
agreeable
day
:
though
he
wanted
no
artificial
remembrance
,
he
was
sure
<EOS>
(
here
Mr
Dombey
made
another
of
his
bows
)
,
which
he
must
always
highly
value
.
<EOS>
Withers
the
lean
having
Edith
's
sketch
-
book
under
his
arm
,
was
immediately
called
upon
by
Mrs
Skewton
to
produce
the
same
:
and
the
carriage
stopped
,
that
Edith
might
make
the
drawing
,
which
Mr
Dombey
was
to
put
away
among
his
treasures
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
afraid
I
trouble
you
too
much
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
.
<EOS>
Where
would
you
wish
it
taken
from
?
"
<EOS>
she
answered
,
turning
to
him
with
the
same
enforced
attention
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
with
another
bow
,
which
cracked
the
starch
in
his
cravat
,
would
beg
to
leave
that
to
the
Artist
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
you
chose
for
yourself
,
"
said
Edith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
then
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
we
say
from
here
.
<EOS>
It
appears
a
good
spot
for
the
purpose
,
or
---
Carker
,
what
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
happened
to
be
in
the
foreground
,
at
some
little
distance
,
a
grove
of
trees
,
not
unlike
that
in
which
Mr
Carker
had
made
his
chain
of
footsteps
in
the
morning
,
and
with
a
seat
under
one
tree
,
greatly
resembling
,
in
the
general
character
of
its
situation
,
the
point
where
his
chain
had
broken
.
  
<EOS>
"
Might
I
venture
to
suggest
to
Mrs
Granger
,
"
said
Carker
,
"
that
that
is
an
interesting
---
almost
a
curious
---
point
of
view
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
followed
the
direction
of
his
riding
-
whip
with
her
eyes
,
and
raised
them
quickly
to
his
face
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
second
glance
they
had
exchanged
since
their
introduction
;
and
would
have
been
exactly
like
the
first
,
but
that
its
expression
was
plainer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
like
that
?
"
said
Edith
to
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
charmed
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
to
Edith
.
  
<EOS>
Therefore
the
carriage
was
driven
to
the
spot
where
Mr
Dombey
was
to
be
charmed
;
and
Edith
,
without
moving
from
her
seat
,
and
opening
her
sketch
-
book
with
her
usual
proud
indifference
,
began
to
sketch
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
pencils
are
all
pointless
,
"
she
said
,
stopping
and
turning
them
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
allow
me
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Or
Carker
will
do
it
better
,
as
he
understands
these
things
.
<EOS>
Carker
,
have
the
goodness
to
see
to
these
pencils
for
Mrs
Granger
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
rode
up
close
to
the
carriage
-
door
on
Mrs
Granger
's
side
,
and
letting
the
rein
fall
on
his
horse
's
neck
,
took
the
pencils
from
her
hand
with
a
smile
and
a
bow
,
and
sat
in
the
saddle
leisurely
mending
them
.
<EOS>
Having
done
so
,
he
begged
to
be
allowed
to
hold
them
,
and
to
hand
them
to
her
as
they
were
required
;
and
thus
Mr
Carker
,
with
many
commendations
of
Mrs
Granger
's
extraordinary
skill
---
especially
in
trees
---
remained
close
at
her
side
,
looking
over
the
drawing
as
she
made
it
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
in
the
meantime
stood
bolt
upright
in
the
carriage
like
a
highly
respectable
ghost
,
looking
on
too
;
while
Cleopatra
and
the
Major
dallied
as
two
ancient
doves
might
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
satisified
with
that
,
or
shall
I
finish
it
a
little
more
?
<EOS>
"
said
Edith
,
showing
the
sketch
to
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
begged
that
it
might
not
be
touched
;
it
was
perfection
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
most
extraordinary
,
"
said
Carker
,
bringing
every
one
of
his
red
gums
to
bear
upon
his
praise
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
prepared
for
anything
so
beautiful
,
and
so
unusual
altogether
.
"
  
This
might
have
applied
to
the
sketcher
no
less
than
to
the
sketch
;
but
Mr
Carker
's
manner
was
openness
itself
---
not
as
to
his
mouth
alone
,
but
as
to
his
whole
spirit
.
<EOS>
So
it
continued
to
be
while
the
drawing
was
laid
aside
for
Mr
Dombey
,
and
while
the
sketching
materials
were
put
up
;
then
he
handed
in
the
pencils
(
which
were
received
with
a
distant
acknowledgment
of
his
help
,
but
without
a
look
)
,
and
tightening
his
rein
,
fell
back
,
and
followed
the
carriage
again
.
  
<EOS>
Thinking
,
perhaps
,
as
he
rode
,
that
even
this
trivial
sketch
had
been
made
and
delivered
to
its
owner
,
as
if
it
had
been
bargained
for
and
bought
.
<EOS>
Thinking
,
perhaps
,
that
although
she
had
assented
with
such
perfect
readiness
to
his
request
,
her
haughty
face
,
bent
over
the
drawing
,
or
glancing
at
the
distant
objects
represented
in
it
,
had
been
the
face
of
a
proud
woman
,
engaged
in
a
sordid
and
miserable
transaction
.
<EOS>
Thinking
,
perhaps
,
of
such
things
:
but
smiling
certainly
,
and
while
he
seemed
to
look
about
him
freely
,
in
enjoyment
of
the
air
and
exercise
,
keeping
always
that
sharp
corner
of
his
eye
upon
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
A
stroll
among
the
haunted
ruins
of
Kenilworth
,
and
more
rides
to
more
points
of
view
;
most
of
which
,
Mrs
Skewton
reminded
Mr
Dombey
,
Edith
had
already
sketched
,
as
he
had
seen
in
looking
over
her
drawings
:
<EOS>
brought
the
day
's
expedition
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
and
Edith
were
driven
to
their
own
lodgings
;
Mr
Carker
was
graciously
invited
by
Cleopatra
to
return
thither
with
Mr
Dombey
and
the
Major
,
in
the
evening
,
to
hear
some
of
Edith
's
music
;
and
the
three
gentlemen
repaired
to
their
hotel
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
The
dinner
was
the
counterpart
of
yesterday
's
,
except
that
the
Major
was
twenty
-
four
hours
more
triumphant
and
less
mysterious
.
<EOS>
Edith
was
toasted
again
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
was
again
agreeably
embarrassed
.
<EOS>
And
Mr
Carker
was
full
of
interest
and
praise
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
no
other
visitors
at
Mrs
Skewton
's
.
<EOS>
Edith
's
drawings
were
strewn
about
the
room
,
a
little
more
abundantly
than
usual
perhaps
;
and
Withers
,
the
wan
page
,
handed
round
a
little
stronger
tea
.
<EOS>
The
harp
was
there
;
the
piano
was
there
;
and
Edith
sang
and
played
.
<EOS>
But
even
the
music
was
played
by
Edith
to
Mr
Dombey
's
order
,
as
it
were
,
in
the
same
uncompromising
way
.
<EOS>
As
thus
.
  
<EOS>
"
Edith
,
my
dearest
love
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
half
an
hour
after
tea
,
"
Mr
Dombey
is
dying
to
hear
you
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dombey
has
life
enough
left
to
say
so
for
himself
,
mama
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
immensely
obliged
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
wish
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Piano
?
<EOS>
"
hesitated
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whatever
you
please
.
<EOS>
You
have
only
to
choose
.
"
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
she
began
with
the
piano
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
same
with
the
harp
;
the
same
with
her
singing
;
the
same
with
the
selection
of
the
pieces
that
she
sang
and
played
.
<EOS>
Such
frigid
and
constrained
,
yet
prompt
and
pointed
acquiescence
with
the
wishes
he
imposed
upon
her
,
and
on
no
one
else
,
was
sufficiently
remarkable
to
penetrate
through
all
the
mysteries
of
picquet
,
and
impress
itself
on
Mr
Carker
's
keen
attention
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
Mr
Dombey
was
evidently
proud
of
his
power
,
and
liked
to
show
it
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
Mr
Carker
played
so
well
---
some
games
with
the
Major
,
and
some
with
Cleopatra
,
whose
vigilance
of
eye
in
respect
of
Mr
Dombey
and
Edith
<EOS>
no
lynx
could
have
surpassed
---
that
he
even
heightened
his
position
in
the
lady
-
mother
's
good
graces
;
and
when
on
taking
leave
he
regretted
that
he
would
be
obliged
to
return
to
London
next
morning
,
Cleopatra
trusted
:
community
of
feeling
not
being
met
with
every
day
:
that
it
was
far
from
being
the
last
time
they
would
meet
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
with
an
expressive
look
at
the
couple
in
the
distance
,
as
he
drew
towards
the
door
,
following
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
who
had
taken
a
stately
leave
of
Edith
,
bent
,
or
made
some
approach
to
a
bend
,
over
Cleopatra
's
couch
,
and
said
,
in
a
low
voice
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
requested
Mrs
Granger
's
permission
to
call
on
her
to
-
morrow
morning
---
for
a
purpose
---
and
she
has
appointed
twelve
o'clock
.
<EOS>
May
I
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
finding
you
at
home
,
madam
,
afterwards
?
"
  
<EOS>
Cleopatra
was
so
much
fluttered
and
moved
,
by
hearing
this
,
of
course
,
incomprehensible
speech
,
that
she
could
only
shut
her
eyes
,
and
shake
her
head
,
and
give
Mr
Dombey
her
hand
;
which
Mr
Dombey
,
not
exactly
knowing
what
to
do
with
,
dropped
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dombey
,
come
along
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
Major
,
looking
in
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
Damme
,
Sir
,
old
Joe
has
a
great
mind
to
propose
an
alteration
in
the
name
of
the
Royal
Hotel
,
and
that
it
should
be
called
the
Tree
Jolly
Bachelors
,
in
honour
of
ourselves
and
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
With
this
the
Major
slapped
Mr
Dombey
on
the
back
,
and
winking
over
his
shoulder
at
the
ladies
,
with
a
frightful
tendency
of
blood
to
the
head
,
carried
him
off
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
reposed
on
her
sofa
,
and
Edith
sat
apart
,
by
her
harp
,
in
silence
.
<EOS>
The
mother
,
trifling
with
her
fan
,
looked
stealthily
at
the
daughter
more
than
once
,
but
the
daughter
,
brooding
gloomily
with
downcast
eyes
,
was
not
to
be
disturbed
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
they
remained
for
a
long
hour
,
without
a
word
,
until
Mrs
Skewton
's
maid
appeared
,
according
to
custom
,
to
prepare
her
gradually
for
night
.
<EOS>
At
night
,
she
should
have
been
a
skeleton
,
with
dart
and
hour
-
glass
,
rather
than
a
woman
,
this
attendant
;
for
her
touch
was
as
the
touch
of
Death
.
<EOS>
The
painted
object
shrivelled
underneath
her
hand
;
the
form
collapsed
,
the
hair
dropped
off
,
the
arched
dark
eyebrows
changed
to
scanty
tufts
of
grey
;
the
pale
lips
shrunk
,
the
skin
became
cadaverous
and
loose
;
an
old
,
worn
,
yellow
,
nodding
woman
,
with
red
eyes
,
alone
remained
in
Cleopatra
's
place
,
huddled
up
,
like
a
slovenly
bundle
,
in
a
greasy
flannel
gown
.
  
<EOS>
The
very
voice
was
changed
,
as
it
addressed
Edith
,
when
they
were
alone
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
tell
me
,
"
it
said
sharply
,
"
that
he
is
coming
here
to
-
morrow
by
appointment
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
you
know
it
,
"
returned
Edith
,
"
Mother
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
mocking
emphasis
she
laid
on
that
one
word
!
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
he
has
bought
me
,
"
she
resumed
.
<EOS>
"
Or
that
he
will
,
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
has
considered
of
his
bargain
;
he
has
shown
it
to
his
friend
;
he
is
even
rather
proud
of
it
;
he
thinks
that
it
will
suit
him
,
and
may
be
had
sufficiently
cheap
;
and
he
will
buy
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
God
,
that
I
have
lived
for
this
,
and
that
I
feel
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Compress
into
one
handsome
face
the
conscious
self
-
abasement
,
and
the
burning
indignation
of
a
hundred
women
,
strong
in
passion
and
in
pride
;
and
there
it
hid
itself
with
two
white
shuddering
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
returned
the
angry
mother
.
"
<EOS>
Have
n't
you
from
a
child
---
"
  
"
A
child
!
"
said
Edith
,
looking
at
her
,
"
when
was
I
a
child
?
<EOS>
What
childhood
did
you
ever
leave
to
me
?
<EOS>
I
was
a
woman
---
artful
,
designing
,
mercenary
,
laying
snares
for
men
---
before
I
knew
myself
,
or
you
,
or
even
understood
the
base
and
wretched
aim
of
every
new
display
I
learnt
.
<EOS>
You
gave
birth
to
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Look
upon
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
in
her
pride
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
as
she
spoke
,
she
struck
her
hand
upon
her
beautiful
bosom
,
as
though
she
would
have
beaten
down
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
at
me
,
"
she
said
,
"
who
have
never
known
what
it
is
to
have
an
honest
heart
,
and
love
.
<EOS>
Look
at
me
,
taught
to
scheme
and
plot
when
children
play
;
and
married
in
my
youth
---
an
old
age
of
design
---
to
one
for
whom
I
had
no
feeling
but
indifference
.
<EOS>
Look
at
me
,
whom
he
left
a
widow
,
dying
before
his
inheritance
descended
to
him
---
a
judgment
on
you
!
<EOS>
well
deserved
!
---
and
tell
me
what
has
been
my
life
for
ten
years
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
making
every
effort
to
endeavour
to
secure
to
you
a
good
establishment
,
"
rejoined
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
That
has
been
your
life
.
<EOS>
And
now
you
have
got
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
slave
in
a
market
;
there
is
no
horse
in
a
fair
:
so
shown
and
offered
and
examined
and
paraded
,
mother
,
as
I
have
been
,
for
ten
shameful
years
,
"
cried
Edith
,
with
a
burning
brow
,
and
the
same
bitter
emphasis
on
the
one
word
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
it
not
so
?
<EOS>
Have
I
been
made
the
bye
-
word
of
all
kinds
of
men
?
<EOS>
Have
fools
,
have
profligates
,
have
boys
,
have
dotards
,
dangled
after
me
,
and
one
by
one
rejected
me
,
and
fallen
off
,
because
you
were
too
plain
with
all
your
cunning
:
yes
,
and
too
true
,
with
all
those
false
pretences
:
until
we
have
almost
come
to
be
notorious
?
<EOS>
The
licence
of
look
and
touch
,
"
she
said
,
with
flashing
eyes
,
"
have
I
submitted
to
it
,
in
half
the
places
of
resort
upon
the
map
of
England
.
<EOS>
Have
I
been
hawked
and
vended
here
<EOS>
and
there
until
<EOS>
the
last
grain
of
self
-
respect
is
dead
within
me
,
and
I
loathe
myself
?
<EOS>
Has
this
been
my
late
childhood
?
<EOS>
I
had
none
before
.
<EOS>
Do
not
tell
me
that
I
had
,
to

night
,
of
all
nights
in
my
life
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
have
been
well
married
,
"
said
her
mother
,
"
twenty
times
at
least
,
Edith
,
if
you
had
given
encouragement
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
<EOS>
Who
takes
me
,
refuse
that
I
am
,
and
as
I
well
deserve
to
be
,
"
she
answered
,
raising
her
head
,
and
trembling
in
her
energy
of
shame
and
stormy
pride
,
"
shall
take
me
,
as
this
man
does
,
with
no
art
of
mine
put
forth
to
lure
him
.
<EOS>
He
sees
me
at
the
auction
,
and
he
thinks
it
well
to
buy
me
.
<EOS>
Let
him
!
<EOS>
When
he
came
to
view
me
---
perhaps
to
bid
---
he
required
to
see
the
roll
of
my
accomplishments
.
<EOS>
I
gave
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
would
have
me
show
one
of
them
,
to
justify
his
purchase
to
his
men
<EOS>
,
I
require
of
him
to
say
which
he
demands
,
and
I
exhibit
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
do
no
more
.
<EOS>
He
makes
the
purchase
of
his
own
will
,
and
with
his
own
sense
of
its
worth
,
and
the
power
of
his
money
;
and
I
hope
it
may
never
disappoint
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
vaunted
and
pressed
the
bargain
;
neither
have
you
,
so
far
as
I
have
been
able
to
prevent
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
talk
strangely
to
-
night
,
Edith
,
to
your
own
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
so
to
me
;
stranger
to
me
than
you
,
"
said
Edith
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
my
education
was
completed
long
ago
.
<EOS>
I
am
too
old
now
,
and
have
fallen
too
low
,
by
degrees
,
to
take
a
new
course
,
and
to
stop
yours
,
and
to
help
myself
.
<EOS>
The
germ
of
all
that
purifies
a
woman
's
breast
,
and
makes
it
true
and
good
,
has
never
stirred
in
mine
,
and
I
have
nothing
else
to
sustain
me
when
I
despise
myself
.
<EOS>
"
There
had
been
a
touching
sadness
in
her
voice
,
but
it
was
gone
,
when
she
went
on
to
say
,
with
a
curled
lip
,
"
So
,
as
we
are
genteel
and
poor
,
I
am
content
that
we
should
be
made
rich
by
these
means
;
all
I
say
is
,
I
have
kept
the
only
purpose
I
have
had
the
strength
to
form
---
I
had
almost
said
the
power
,
with
you
at
my
side
,
mother
---
and
have
not
tempted
this
man
on
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
This
man
!
<EOS>
You
speak
,
"
said
her
mother
,
"
as
if
you
hated
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
thought
I
loved
him
,
did
you
not
?
"
<EOS>
she
answered
,
stopping
on
her
way
across
the
room
,
and
looking
round
.
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you
,
"
she
continued
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
mother
,
"
who
already
knows
us
thoroughly
,
and
reads
us
right
,
and
before
whom
I
have
even
less
of
self
-
respect
or
confidence
than
before
my
own
inward
self
;
being
so
much
degraded
by
his
knowledge
of
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
an
attack
,
I
suppose
,
"
returned
her
mother
coldly
,
"
on
poor
,
unfortunate
what's
-
his
-
name
---
Mr
Carker
!
<EOS>
Your
want
of
self

respect
and
confidence
,
my
dear
,
in
reference
to
that
person
(
who
is
very
agreeable
,
it
strikes
me
)
,
is
not
likely
to
have
much
effect
on
your
establishment

<EOS>
Why
do
you
look
at
me
so
hard
?
<EOS>
Are
you
ill
?
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
suddenly
let
fall
her
face
,
as
if
it
had
been
stung
,
and
while
she
pressed
her
hands
upon
it
,
a
terrible
tremble
crept
over
her
whole
frame
.
<EOS>
It
was
quickly
gone
;
and
with
her
usual
step
,
she
passed
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
maid
who
should
have
been
a
skeleton
,
then
reappeared
,
and
giving
one
arm
to
her
mistress

who
appeared
to
have
taken
off
her
manner
with
her
charms
,
and
to
have
put
on
paralysis
with
her
flannel
gown
,
collected
the
ashes
of
Cleopatra

carried
them
away
in

ready
for

"
So

said
Florence
to
the
excellent
Nipper
,
"
when
we
are
going
back
to
our
quiet

<EOS>
Susan
drew
in
her
breath
with
an
amount
of
expression
not
easily
described
,
and
further
relieving
her
feelings
with
a
smart
cough
,
answered
,
"
Very
quiet
indeed

Miss

Excessive
so

<EOS>
"
When
I
was

said
Florence
,
thoughtfully
,
and
after
musing
for
some
moments
,
"
did
you
ever
see
that
gentleman

has
taken
the
trouble
to
ride
down

three

three

Three
times

Miss

returned
the
Nipper
.
<EOS>
"
Once
when
you
was
out
a
walking
with
them
Sket

Florence
gently
looked
at
her
,
and
Miss
Nipper
checked
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
With
Sir
Barnet
and
his
lady

I
mean
to
say
,
Miss

and
the
young
gentleman

And
two
evenings
since
then

<EOS>
"
When
I
was
a
child
,
and
when
company
used
to
come
to
visit
papa

did
you
ever
see
that
gentleman
at
home

Susan

asked
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Miss
,
"
returned
her
maid
,
after
considering
,
"
I
really
could
n't
say
I
ever
did
.
<EOS>
When
your
poor
dear
ma
died
,
Miss
Floy
,
I
was
very
new
in
the
family
,
you
see
,
and
my
element
:
"
the
Nipper
bridled
,
as
opining
that
her
merits
had
been
always
designedly
extinguished
by
Mr
Dombey
:
"
was
the
floor
below
the
attics
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
sure
,
"
said
Florence
,
still
thoughtfully
;
"
you
are
not
likely
to
have
known
who
came
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
quite
forgot
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
,
Miss
,
but
what
we
talked
about
the
family
and
visitors

"
said
Susan
,
"
and
but
what
I
heard
much
said
,
although
the
nurse
before
Mrs
Richards
did
make
unpleasant
remarks
when
I
was
in
company
,
and
hint
at
little
Pitchers
,
but
that
could
only
be
attributed
,
poor
thing

"
observed
Susan
,
with
composed
forbearance
,
"
to
habits
of
intoxication
,
for
which
she
was
required
to
leave
,
and
did

<EOS>
Florence
,
who
was
seated
at
her
chamber
window
,
with
her
face
resting
on
her
hand
,
sat
looking
out
,
and
hardly
seemed
to
hear
what
Susan
said
,
she
was
so
lost
in
thought
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
all
events

Miss

said
Susan
,
"
I
remember
very
well

this

great
a

It

affairs
in
the
City

and
managed
the
whole

and
that
your
Pa
minded
him
more
than
anybody
,
which
,
begging
your
pardon
,
Miss
Floy
,
he
might
easy
do
,
for
he
never
minded
anybody
else

<EOS>
I
knew
that
,
Pitcher
as
I
might
have
been
.
"
  
<EOS>
Susan
Nipper
,
with
an
injured
remembrance
of
the
nurse
before
Mrs
Richards
,
emphasised
"
Pitcher
"
strongly
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
that
Mr
Carker
has
not
fallen
off
,
Miss

"
she
pursued
,
"
but
has
stood
his
ground
,
and
kept
his
credit
with
your
Pa
,
I
know
from
what
is
always
said
among
our
people
by
that
Perch
,
whenever
he
comes
to
the
house
;
and
though
he
's
the
weakest
weed
in
the
world
,
Miss
Floy
,
and
no
one
can
have
a
moment
's
patience
with
the
man
,
he
knows
what
goes
on
in
the
City
tolerable
well
,
and
says
that
your
Pa
does
nothing
without
Mr
Carker
,
and
leaves
all
to
Mr
Carker
,
and
acts
according
to
Mr
Carker
,
and
has
Mr
Carker
always
at
his
elbow
,
and
I
do
believe
that
he
believes
(
that
washiest
of
Perches
!
)
<EOS>
that
after
your
Pa
,
the
Emperor
of
India
is
the
child
unborn
to
Mr
Carker
.
"
  
<EOS>
Not
a
word
of
this
was
lost
on
Florence
,
who
,
with
an
awakened
interest
in
Susan
's
speech
,
no
longer
gazed
abstractedly
on
the
prospect
without
,
but
looked
at
her
,
and
listened
with
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Susan
,
"
she
said
,
when
that
young
lady
had
concluded
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
in
Papa
's
confidence
,
and
is
his
friend
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
's
mind
ran
high
on
this
theme
,
and
had
done
for
some
days
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
,
in
the
two
visits
with
which
he
had
followed
up
his
first
one
,
had
assumed
a
confidence
between
himself
and
her
---
a
right
on
his
part
to
be
mysterious
and
stealthy
,
in
telling
her
that
the
ship
was
still
unheard
of
---
a
kind
of
mildly
restrained
power
and
authority
over
her
---
that
made
her
wonder
,
and
caused
her
great
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
means
of
repelling
it
,
or
of
freeing
herself
from
the
web
he
was
gradually
winding
about
her
;
for
that
would
have
required
some
art
and
knowledge
of
the
world
,
opposed
to
such
address
is
his
;
and
Florence
had
none
.
<EOS>
True
,
he
had
said
no
more
to
her
than
that
there
was
no
news
of
the
ship
,
and
that
he
feared
the
worst
;
but
how
he
came
to
know
that
she
was
interested
in
the
ship
,
and
why
he
had
the
right
to
signify
his
knowledge
to
her
,
so
insidiously
and
darkly
<EOS>
,
troubled
Florence
very
much
.
  
<EOS>
This
conduct
on
the
part
of
Mr
Carker
,
and
her
habit
of
often
considering
it
with
wonder
and
uneasiness
,
began
to
invest
him
with
an
uncomfortable
fascination
in
Florence
's
thoughts
.
<EOS>
A
more
distinct
remembrance
of
his
features
,
voice
,
and
manner
:
which
she
sometimes
courted
,
as
a
means
of
reducing
him
to
the
level
of
a
real
personage
,
capable
of
exerting
no
greater
charm
over
her
than
another
:
did
not
remove
the
vague
impression
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
never
frowned
,
or
looked
upon
her
with
an
air
of
dislike
or
animosity
,
but
was
always
smiling
and
serene
.
  
<EOS>
Again
,
Florence
,
in
pursuit
of
her
strong
purpose
with
reference
to
her
father
,
and
her
steady
resolution
to
believe
that
she
was
herself
unwittingly
to
blame
for
their
so
cold
and
distant
relations
,
would
recall
to
mind
that
this
gentleman
was
his
confidential
friend
,
and
would
think
,
with
an
anxious
heart
,
could
her
struggling
tendency
to
dislike
and
fear
him
be
a
part
of
that
misfortune
in
her
,
which
had
turned
her
father
's
love
adrift
,
and
left
her
so
alone
?
<EOS>
She
dreaded
that
it
might
be
;
sometimes
believed
it
was
:
then
she
resolved
that
she
would
try
to
conquer
this
wrong
feeling
;
persuaded
herself
that
she
was
honoured
and
encouraged
by
the
notice
of
her
father
's
friend
;
and
hoped
that
patient
observation
of
him
and
trust
in
him
would
lead
her
bleeding
feet
along
that
stony
road
which
ended
in
her
father
's
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
,
with
no
one
to
advise
her
---
for
she
could
advise
with
no
one
without
seeming
to
complain
against
him
---
gentle
Florence
tossed
on
an
uneasy
sea
of
doubt
and
hope
;
and
Mr
Carker
,
like
a
scaly
monster
of
the
deep
,
swam
down
below
,
and
kept
his
shining
eye
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
had
a
new
reason
in
all
this
for
wishing
to
be
at
home
again
.
<EOS>
Her
lonely
life
was
better
suited
to
her
course
of
timid
hope
and
doubt
;
and
she
feared
sometimes
,
that
in
her
absence
she
might
miss
some
hopeful
chance
of
testifying
her
affection
for
her
father
.
<EOS>
Heaven
knows
,
she
might
have
set
her
mind
at
rest
,
poor
child
!
<EOS>
on
this
last
point
;
but
her
slighted
love
was
fluttering
within
her
,
and
,
even
in
her
sleep
,
it
flew
away
in
dreams
,
and
nestled
,
like
a
wandering
bird
<EOS>
come
home
,
upon
her
father
's
neck
.
  
<EOS>
Of
Walter
she
thought
often
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
how
often
,
when
the
night
was
gloomy
,
and
the
wind
was
blowing
round
<EOS>
the
house!But
hope
was
strong
in
her
breast
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
difficult
for
the
young
and
ardent
,
even
with
such
experience
as
hers
,
to
imagine
youth
and
ardour
quenched
like
a
weak
flame
,
and
the
bright
day
of
life
merging
into
night
,
at
noon
,
that
hope
was
strong
yet
.
<EOS>
Her
tears
fell
frequently
for
Walter
's
sufferings
;
but
rarely
for
his
supposed
death
,
and
never
long
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
written
to
the
old
Instrument
-
maker
,
but
had
received
no
answer
to
her
note
:
which
indeed
required
none
.
<EOS>
Thus
matters
stood
with
Florence
on
the
morning
when
she
was
going
home
,
gladly
,
to
her
old
secluded
life
.
  
<EOS>
Doctor
and
Mrs
Blimber
,
accompanied
(
much
against
his
will
)
by
their
valued
charge
,
Master
Barnet
,
were
already
gone
back
to
Brighton
,
where
that
young
gentleman
and
his
fellow
-
pilgrims
to
Parnassus
were
then
,
no
doubt
,
in
the
continual
resumption
of
their
studies
.
<EOS>
The
holiday
time
was
past
and
over
;
most
of
the
juvenile
guests
at
the
villa
had
taken
their
departure
:
and
Florence
's
long
visit
was
come
to
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
one
guest
,
however
,
albeit
not
resident
within
the
house
,
who
had
been
very
constant
in
his
attention
to
the
family
,
and
who
still
remained
devoted
to
them
.
<EOS>
This
was
Mr
Toots
,
who
after
renewing
,
some
weeks
ago
,
the
acquaintance
he
had
had
the
happiness
of
forming
with
Skettles
Junior
,
on
the
night
when
he
burst
the
Blimberian
bonds
and
soared
into
freedom
with
his
ring
on
,
called
regularly
every
other
day
,
and
left
a
perfect
pack
of
cards
at
the
hall
-
door
;
so
many
indeed
,
that
the
ceremony
was
quite
a
deal
on
the
part
of
Mr
Toots
,
and
a
hand
at
whist
on
the
part
of
the
servant
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
likewise
,
with
the
bold
and
happy
idea
of
preventing
the
family
from
forgetting
him
(
but
there
is
reason
to
suppose
that
this
expedient
originated
in
the
teeming
brain
of
the
Chicken
)
,
had
established
a
six
-
oared
cutter
,
manned
by
aquatic
friends
of
the
Chicken
's
and
steered
by
that
illustrious
character
in
person
,
who
wore
a
bright
red
fireman
's
coat
for
the
purpose
,
and
concealed
the
perpetual
black
eye
with
which
he
was
afflicted
,
beneath
a
green
shade
.
<EOS>
Previous
to
the
institution
of
this
equipage
,
Mr
Toots
sounded
the
Chicken
on
a
hypothetical
case
,
as
,
supposing
the
Chicken
to
be
enamoured
of
a
young
lady
named
Mary
,
and
to
have
conceived
the
intention
of
starting
a
boat
of
his
own
,
what
would
he
call
that
boat
?
<EOS>
The
Chicken
replied
,
with
divers
strong
asseverations
,
that
he
would
either
christen
it
Poll
or
The
Chicken
's
Delight
.
<EOS>
Improving
on
this
idea
,
Mr
Toots
,
after
deep
study
and
the
exercise
of
much
invention
,
resolved
to
call
his
boat
The
Toots
's
Joy
,
as
a
delicate
compliment
to
Florence
,
of
which
no
man
knowing
the
parties
,
could
possibly
miss
the
appreciation
.
  
<EOS>
Stretched
on
a
crimson
cushion
in
his
gallant
bark
,
with
his
shoes
in
the
air
,
Mr
Toots
,
in
the
exercise
of
his
project
,
had
come
up
the
river
,
day
after
day
,
and
week
after
week
,
and
had
flitted
to
and
fro
,
near
Sir
Barnet
's
garden
,
and
had
caused
his
crew
to
cut
across
and
across
the
river
at
sharp
angles
,
for
his
better
exhibition
to
any
lookers
-
out
from
Sir
Barnet
's
windows
,
and
had
had
such
evolutions
performed
by
the
Toots
's
Joy
as
had
filled
all
the
neighbouring
part
of
the
water
-
side
with
astonishment
.
<EOS>
But
whenever
he
saw
any
one
in
Sir
Barnet
's
garden
on
the
brink
of
the
river
,
Mr
Toots
always
feigned
to
be
passing
there
,
by
a
combination
of
coincidences
of
the
most
singular
and
unlikely
description
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
,
Toots
?
"
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
would
say
,
waving
his
hand
from
the
lawn
,
while
the
artful
Chicken
steered
close
in
shore
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
de
do
,
Sir
Barnet
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
would
answer
,
"
What
a
surprising
thing
that
I
should
see
you
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
in
his
sagacity
,
always
said
this
,
as
if
,
instead
of
that
being
Sir
Barnet
's
house
,
it
were
some
deserted
edifice
on
the
banks
of
the
Nile
,
or
Ganges
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
was
so
surprised
!
"
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
would
exclaim
.
<EOS>
---
"
Is
Miss
Dombey
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
Whereupon
Florence
would
appear
,
perhaps
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Diogenes
is
quite
well
,
Miss
Dombey
,
"
Mr
Toots
would
cry
.
<EOS>
"
I
called
to
ask
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
very
much
!
"
<EOS>
the
pleasant
voice
of
Florence
would
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
come
ashore
,
Toots
?
"
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
would
say
then
.
<EOS>
"
Come
!
<EOS>
you
're
in
no
hurry
.
<EOS>
Come
and
see
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
of
no
consequence
,
thank
you
!
"
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
would
blushingly
rejoin
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
Miss
Dombey
might
like
to
know
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
"
<EOS>
And
poor
Mr
Toots
,
who
was
dying
to
accept
the
invitation
,
but
had
n't
the
courage
to
do
it
,
signed
to
the
Chicken
,
with
an
aching
heart
,
and
away
went
the
Joy
,
cleaving
the
water
like
an
arrow
.
  
<EOS>
The
Joy
was
lying
in
a
state
of
extraordinary
splendour
,
at
the
garden
steps
,
on
the
morning
of
Florence
's
departure
.
<EOS>
When
she
went
down
stairs
to
take
leave
,
after
her
talk
with
Susan
,
she
found
Mr
Toots
awaiting
her
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
de
do
,
Miss
Dombey
?
"
said
the
stricken
Toots
,
always
dreadfully
disconcerted
when
the
desire
of
his
heart
was
gained
,
and
he
was
speaking
to
her
;
"
thank
you
,
<EOS>
I
'm
very
well
indeed
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
're
the
same
,
so
was
Diogenes
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
,
"
said
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
it
's
of
no
consequence
,
"
retorted
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
perhaps
you
would
n't
mind
,
in
this
fine
weather
,
coming
home
by
water
,
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
There
's
plenty
of
room
in
the
boat
for
your
maid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
"
said
Florence
,
hesitating
.
<EOS>
"
I
really
am
---
but
I
would
rather
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
of
no
consequence
,
"
retorted
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
morning
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
wait
and
see
Lady
Skettles
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Florence
,
kindly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
thank
you
,
"
returned
Mr
Toots
,
"
it
's
of
no
consequence
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
shy
was
Mr
Toots
on
such
occasions
,
and
<EOS>
so
flurried!But
<EOS>
Lady
Skettles
entering
at
the
moment
,
Mr
Toots
was
suddenly
seized
with
a
passion
for
asking
her
how
she
did
,
and
hoping
she
was
very
well
;
nor
could
Mr
Toots
by
any
possibility
leave
off
shaking
hands
with
her
,
until
Sir
Barnet
appeared
:
to
whom
he
immediately
clung
with
the
tenacity
of
desperation
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
losing
,
to
-
day
,
Toots
,
"
said
Sir
Barnet
,
turning
towards
Florence
,
"
the
light
of
our
house
,
I
assure
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
of
no
conseqI
<EOS>
mean
<EOS>
yes
,
to
be
sure
,
"
faltered
the
embarrassed
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
GOODmorning
!
"
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
emphatic
nature
of
this
farewell
,
Mr
Toots
,
instead
of
going
away
,
stood
leering
about
him
,
vacantly
.
<EOS>
Florence
,
to
relieve
him
,
bade
adieu
,
with
many
thanks
,
to
Lady
Skettles
,
and
gave
her
arm
to
Sir
Barnet
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
beg
of
you
,
my
dear
Miss
Dombey
,
"
said
her
host
,
as
he
conducted
her
to
the
carriage
,
"
to
present
my
best
compliments
to
your
dear
Papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
distressing
to
Florence
to
receive
the
commission
,
for
she
felt
as
if
she
were
imposing
on
Sir
Barnet
by
allowing
him
to
believe
that
a
kindness
rendered
to
her
,
was
rendered
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
As
she
could
not
explain
,
however
,
she
bowed
her
head
and
thanked
him
;
and
again
she
thought
that
the
dull
home
,
free
from
such
embarrassments
,
and
such
reminders
of
her
sorrow
,
was
her
natural
and
best
retreat
.
  
<EOS>
Such
of
her
late
friends
and
companions
as
were
yet
remaining
at
the
villa
,
came
running
from
within
,
and
from
the
garden
,
to
say
<EOS>
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
attached
to
her
,
and
very
earnest
in
taking
leave
of
her
.
<EOS>
Even
the
household
were
sorry
for
her
going
,
and
the
servants
came
nodding
and
curtseying
round
the
carriage
door
.
<EOS>
As
Florence
looked
round
on
the
kind
faces
,
and
saw
among
them
those
of
Sir
Barnet
and
his
lady
,
and
of
Mr
Toots
,
who
was
chuckling
and
staring
at
her
from
a
distance
,
she
was
reminded
of
the
night
when
Paul
and
she
had
come
from
Doctor
Blimber
's
:
and
when
the
carriage
drove
away
,
her
face
was
wet
with
tears
.
  
<EOS>
Sorrowful
tears
,
but
tears
of
consolation
,
too
;
for
all
the
softer
memories
connected
with
the
dull
old
house
to
which
she
was
returning
made
it
dear
to
her
,
as
they
rose
up
.
<EOS>
How
long
it
seemed
since
she
had
wandered
through
the
silent
rooms
:
since
she
had
last
crept
,
softly
and
afraid
,
into
those
her
father
occupied
:
since
she
had
felt
the
solemn
but
yet
soothing
influence
of
the
beloved
dead
in
every
action
of
her
daily
life
!
<EOS>
This
new
farewell
reminded
her
,
besides
,
of
her
parting
with
poor
Walter
:
of
his
looks
and
words
that
night
:
and
of
the
gracious
blending
she
had
noticed
in
him
,
of
tenderness
for
those
he
left
behind
,
with
courage
and
high
spirit
.
<EOS>
His
little
history
was
associated
with
the
old
house
too
,
and
gave
it
a
new
claim
and
hold
upon
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Even
Susan
Nipper
softened
towards
the
home
of
so
many
years
,
as
they
were
on
their
way
towards
it
.
<EOS>
Gloomy
as
it
was
,
and
rigid
justice
as
she
rendered
to
its
gloom
<EOS>
,
she
forgave
it
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
it
again
,
I
do
n't
deny
,
Miss
,
"
said
the
Nipper
.
<EOS>
"
There
ai
n't
much
in
it
to
boast
of
,
but
I
would
n't
have
it
burnt
or
pulled
down
,
neither
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
glad
to
go
through
the
old
rooms
,
wo
n't
you
,
Susan
?
"
said
Florence
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Miss
,
"
returned
the
Nipper
,
softening
more
and
more
towards
the
house
,
as
they
approached
it
nearer
,
"
I
wo
n't
deny
but
what
I
shall
,
though
I
shall
hate
'em
again
,
to
-
morrow
,
very
likely
.
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
felt
that
,
for
her
,
there
was
greater
peace
within
it
than
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
It
was
better
and
easier
to
keep
her
secret
shut
up
there
,
among
the
tall
dark
walls
,
than
to
carry
it
abroad
into
the
light
,
and
try
to
hide
it
from
a
crowd
of
happy
eyes
.
<EOS>
It
was
better
to
pursue
the
study
of
her
loving
heart
,
alone
,
and
find
no
new
discouragements
in
loving
hearts
about
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
easier
to
hope
,
and
pray
,
and
love
on
,
all
uncared
for
,
yet
with
constancy
and
patience
,
in
the
tranquil
sanctuary
of
such
remembrances
:
although
it
mouldered
,
rusted
,
and
decayed
about
her
:
than
in
a
new
scene
,
let
its
gaiety
be
what
it
would
.
<EOS>
She
welcomed
back
her
old
enchanted
dream
of
life
,
and
longed
for
the
old
dark
door
to
close
upon
her
,
once
again
.
  
<EOS>
Full
of
such
thoughts
,
they
turned
into
the
long
and
sombre
street
.
<EOS>
Florence
was
not
on
that
side
of
the
carriage
which
was
nearest
to
her
home
,
and
as
the
distance
lessened
between
them
and
it
,
she
looked
out
of
her
window
for
the
children
over
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
thus
engaged
,
when
an
exclamation
from
Susan
caused
her
to
turn
quickly
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Gracious
me
!
"
cried
Susan
,
breathless
,
<EOS>
"
where
's
our
house
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Our
house
!
"
said
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
Susan
,
drawing
in
her
head
from
the
window
,
thrust
it
out
again
,
drew
it
in
again
as
the
carriage
stopped
,
and
stared
at
her
mistress
in
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
labyrinth
of
scaffolding
raised
all
round
the
house
from
the
basement
to
the
roof
.
<EOS>
Loads
of
bricks
and
stones
,
and
heaps
of
mortar
,
and
piles
of
wood
,
blocked
up
half
the
width
and
length
of
the
broad
street
at
the
side
.
<EOS>
Ladders
were
raised
against
the
walls
:
labourers
were
climbing
up
and
down
;
men
were
at
work
upon
the
steps
of
the
scaffolding
:
painters
and
decorators
were
busy
inside
;
great
rolls
of
ornamental
paper
were
being
delivered
from
a
cart
at
the
door
;
an
upholsterer
's
waggon
also
stopped
the
way
;
no
furniture
was
to
be
seen
through
the
gaping
and
broken
windows
in
any
of
the
rooms
;
nothing
but
workmen
,
and
the
implements
of
their
several
trades
swarming
from
the
kitchens
to
the
garrets
.
<EOS>
Inside
and
outside
alike
:
bricklayers
,
painters
,
carpenters
,
masons
:
hammer
,
hod
,
brush
,
pickaxe
,
saw
,
and
trowel
:
all
at
work
together
,
in
full
chorus
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
descended
from
the
coach
,
half
doubting
if
it
were
,
or
could
be
the
right
house
,
until
she
recognized
Towlinson
,
with
a
sun
-
burnt
face
,
standing
at
the
door
to
receive
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
Miss.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
are
great
alterations
going
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Miss
,
great
alterations
,
"
said
Towlinson
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
passed
him
as
if
she
were
in
a
dream
,
and
hurried
up
stairs
.
<EOS>
The
garish
light
was
in
the
long
-
darkened
drawing
-
room
,
and
there
were
steps
and
platforms
,
and
men
in
paper
caps
,
in
the
high
places
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
's
picture
was
gone
with
the
rest
of
the
moveables
,
and
on
the
mark
where
it
had
been
,
was
scrawled
in
chalk
,
"
<EOS>
this
room
in
-
panel
.
<EOS>
Green
and
gold
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
staircase
was
a
labyrinth
of
posts
and
planks
like
the
out
-
side
of
the
house
,
and
a
whole
Olympus
of
plumbers
and
glaziers
was
reclining
in
various
attitudes
,
on
the
skylight
.
<EOS>
Her
own
room
was
not
yet
touched
within
,
but
there
were
beams
and
boards
raised
against
it
without
,
baulking
the
daylight
.
<EOS>
She
went
up
swiftly
to
that
other
bedroom
,
where
the
little
bed
was
;
and
a
dark
giant
of
a
man
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
and
his
head
tied
up
in
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
was
staring
in
at
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
here
that
Susan
Nipper
,
who
had
been
in
quest
of
Florence
,
found
her
,
and
said
,
would
she
go
down
stairs
to
her
Papa
,
who
wished
to
speak
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
home
!
<EOS>
and
wishing
to
speak
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Florence
,
trembling
.
  
<EOS>
Susan
,
who
was
infinitely
more
distraught
than
Florence
herself
,
repeated
her
errand
;
and
Florence
,
pale
and
agitated
,
hurried
down
again
,
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
.
<EOS>
She
thought
upon
the
way
down
,
would
she
dare
to
kiss
him
?
<EOS>
The
longing
of
her
heart
resolved
her
,
and
she
thought
she
would
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
might
have
heard
that
heart
beat
,
when
it
came
into
his
presence
.
<EOS>
One
instant
,
and
it
would
have
beat
against
his
breast
---
   
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
alone
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
ladies
there
;
and
Florence
stopped
.
<EOS>
Striving
so
hard
with
her
emotion
,
that
if
her
brute
friend
Di
had
not
burst
in
and
overwhelmed
her
with
his
caresses
as
a
welcome
home
---
at
which
one
of
the
ladies
gave
a
little
scream
,
and
that
diverted
her
attention
from
herself
---
she
would
have
swooned
upon
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Florence
,
"
said
her
father
,
putting
out
his
hand
:
<EOS>
so
stiffly
that
it
held
her
off
:
"
how
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
took
the
hand
between
her
own
,
and
putting
it
timidly
to
her
lips
,
yielded
to
its
withdrawal
.
<EOS>
It
touched
the
door
in
shutting
it
,
with
quite
as
much
endearment
as
it
had
touched
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
dog
is
that
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
displeased
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
dog
,
Papa
---
from
Brighton
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
"
said
Mr
Dombey
;
and
a
cloud
passed
over
his
face
,
for
he
understood
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
very
good
-
tempered
,
"
said
Florence
,
addressing
herself
with
her
natural
grace
and
sweetness
to
the
two
lady
strangers
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
only
glad
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
Pray
forgive
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
saw
in
the
glance
they
interchanged
,
that
the
lady
who
had
screamed
,
and
who
was
seated
,
was
old
;
and
that
the
other
lady
,
who
stood
near
her
Papa
,
was
very
beautiful
,
and
of
an
elegant
figure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
said
her
father
,
turning
to
the
first
,
and
holding
out
his
hand
,
"
this
is
my
daughter
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Charming
,
I
am
sure
,
"
observed
the
lady
,
putting
up
her
glass
.
"
<EOS>
So
natural
!
<EOS>
My
darling
Florence
,
you
must
kiss
me
,
if
you
please
.
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
having
done
so
,
turned
towards
the
other
lady
,
by
whom
her
father
stood
waiting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Edith
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
this
is
my
daughter
Florence
.
<EOS>
Florence
,
this
lady
will
soon
be
your
Mama
.
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
started
,
and
looked
up
at
the
beautiful
face
in
a
conflict
of
emotions
,
among
which
the
tears
that
name
awakened
,
struggled
for
a
moment
with
surprise
,
interest
,
admiration
,
and
an
indefinable
sort
of
fear
.
<EOS>
Then
she
cried
out
,
"
Oh
,
Papa
,
may
you
be
happy
!
<EOS>
may
you
be
very
,
very
happy
all
your
life
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
fell
weeping
on
the
lady
's
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
short
silence
.
<EOS>
The
beautiful
lady
,
who
at
first
had
seemed
to
hesitate
whether
or
no
she
should
advance
to
Florence
,
held
her
to
her
breast
,
and
pressed
the
hand
with
which
she
clasped
her
,
close
about
her
waist
,
as
if
to
reassure
her
and
comfort
her
.
<EOS>
Not
one
word
passed
the
lady
's
lips
.
<EOS>
She
bent
her
head
down
over
Florence
,
and
she
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
,
but
she
said
no
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
go
on
through
the
rooms
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
and
see
how
our
workmen
are
doing
?
<EOS>
Pray
allow
me
,
my
dear
madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
said
this
in
offering
his
arm
to
Mrs
Skewton
,
who
had
been
looking
at
Florence
through
her
glass
,
as
though
picturing
to
herself
what
she
might
be
made
,
by
the
fashion
---
from
her
own
copious
storehouse
,
no
doubt
---
of
a
little
more
Heart
and
Nature
.
<EOS>
Florence
was
still
sobbing
on
the
lady
's
breast
,
and
holding
to
her
,
when
Mr
Dombey
was
heard
to
say
from
the
Conservatory
:
  
"
Let
us
ask
Edith
.
<EOS>
Dear
me
,
where
is
she
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Edith
,
my
dear
!
"
cried
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
where
are
you
?
<EOS>
Looking
for
Mr
Dombey
somewhere
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
We
are
here
,
my
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
beautiful
lady
released
her
hold
of
Florence
,
and
pressing
her
lips
once
more
upon
her
face
,
withdrew
hurriedly
,
and
joined
them
.
<EOS>
Florence
remained
standing
in
the
same
place
:
happy
,
sorry
,
joyful
,
and
in
tears
,
she
knew
not
how
,
or
how
long
,
but
all
at
once
:
when
her
new
Mama
came
back
,
and
took
her
in
her
arms
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Florence
,
"
said
the
lady
,
hurriedly
,
and
looking
into
her
face
with
great
earnestness
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
begin
by
hating
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
hating
you
,
Mama
?
"
cried
Florence
,
winding
her
arm
round
her
neck
,
and
returning
the
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
Begin
by
thinking
well
of
me
,
"
said
the
beautiful
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Begin
by
believing
that
I
will
try
to
make
you
happy
,
and
that
I
am
prepared
to
love
you
,
Florence
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
We
shall
meet
again
soon
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
stay
here
,
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Again
she
pressed
her
to
her
breast
---
she
had
spoken
in
a
rapid
manner
,
but
firmly
---
and
Florence
saw
her
rejoin
them
in
the
other
room
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
Florence
began
to
hope
that
she
would
learn
from
her
new
and
beautiful
Mama
,
how
to
gain
her
father
's
love
;
and
in
her
sleep
that
night
,
in
her
lost
old
home
,
her
own
Mama
smiled
radiantly
upon
the
hope
,
and
blessed
it
.

The
Opening

all
unconscious

any
such
rare
appearances

Mr

as
scaffoldings

handkerchiefs

glaring
in

Tox
,
and
one
little
silver
scoopful
on
behalf
of
the
teapot
---
a
flight
of
fancy
in
which
good
housekeepers
delight
;
went
up
stairs
to
set
forth
the
bird
waltz
on
the
harpsichord
,
to
water
and
arrange
the
plants
,
to
dust
the
nick
-
nacks
,
and
according
to
her
daily
custom
,
to
make
her
little
drawing
-
room
the
garland
of
Princess
's
Place
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
endued
herself
with
a
pair
of
ancient
gloves
,
like
dead
leaves
,
in
which
she
was
accustomed
to
perform
these
avocations
---
hidden
from
human
sight
at
other
times
in
a
table
drawer
---
and
went
methodically
to
work
;
beginning
with
the
bird
waltz
;
passing
,
by
a
natural
association
of
ideas
,
to
her
bird
---
a
very
high
-
shouldered
canary
,
stricken
in
years
,
and
much
rumpled
,
but
a
piercing
singer
,
as
Princess
's
Place
well
knew
;
taking
,
next
in
order
,
the
little
china
ornaments
,
paper
fly
-
cages
,
and
so
forth
;
and
coming
round
,
in
good
time
,
to
the
plants
,
which
generally
required
to
be
snipped
here
and
there
with
a
pair
of
scissors
,
for
some
botanical
reason
that
was
very
powerful
with
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
was
slow
in
coming
to
the
plants
,
this
morning
.
<EOS>
The
weather
was
warm
,
the
wind
southerly
;
and
there
was
a
sigh
of
the
summer
-
time
in
Princess
's
Place
,
that
turned
Miss
Tox
's
thoughts
upon
the
country
.
<EOS>
The
pot
-
boy
attached
to
the
Princess
's
Arms
had
come
out
with
a
can
and
trickled
water
,
in
a
flowing
pattern
,
all
over
Princess
's
Place
,
and
it
gave
the
weedy
ground
a
fresh
scent
---
quite
a
growing
scent
,
Miss
Tox
said
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
tiny
blink
of
sun
peeping
in
from
the
great
street
round
the
corner
,
and
the
smoky
sparrows
hopped
over
it
and
back
again
,
brightening
as
they
passed
:
or
bathed
in
it
,
like
a
stream
,
and
became
glorified
sparrows
,
unconnected
with
chimneys
.
<EOS>
Legends
in
praise
of
Ginger
-
Beer
,
with
pictorial
representations
of
thirsty
customers
submerged
in
the
effervescence
,
or
stunned
by
the
flying
corks
,
were
conspicuous
in
the
window
of
the
Princess
's
Arms
.
<EOS>
They
were
making
late
hay
,
somewhere
out
of
town
;
and
though
the
fragrance
had
a
long
way
to
come
,
and
many
counter
fragrances
to
contend
with
among
the
dwellings
of
the
poor
<EOS>
(
may
God
reward
the
worthy
gentlemen
who
stickle
for
the
Plague
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
wisdom
of
our
ancestors
,
and
who
do
their
little
best
to
keep
those
dwellings
miserable
!
)
,
yet
it
was
wafted
faintly
into
Princess
's
Place
,
whispering
of
Nature
and
her
wholesome
air
,
as
such
things
will
,
even
unto
prisoners
and
captives
,
and
those
who
are
desolate
and
oppressed
,
in
very
spite
of
aldermen
and
knights
to
boot
:
at
whose
sage
nod
---
and
how
they
nod
!
---
the
rolling
world
stands
still
!
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
sat
down
upon
the
widow
-
seat
,
and
thought
of
her
good
papa
deceased
---
<EOS>
Mr
Tox
,
of
the
Customs
Department
of
the
public
service
;
and
of
her
childhood
,
passed
at
a
seaport
,
among
a
considerable
quantity
of
cold
tar
,
and
some
rusticity
.
<EOS>
She
fell
into
a
softened
remembrance
of
meadows
,
in
old
time
,
gleaming
with
buttercups
,
like
so
many
inverted
firmaments
of
golden
stars
;
and
how
she
had
made
chains
of
dandelion
-
stalks
for
youthful
vowers
of
eternal
constancy
,
dressed
chiefly
in
nankeen
;
and
how
soon
those
fetters
had
withered
and
broken
.
  
<EOS>
Sitting
on
the
window
-
seat
,
and
looking
out
upon
the
sparrows
and
the
blink
of
sun
,
Miss
Tox
thought
likewise
of
her
good
mama
<EOS>
deceased
---
sister
to
the
owner
of
the
powdered
head
and
pigtail
---
of
her
virtues
and
her
rheumatism
.
<EOS>
And
when
a
man
with
bulgy
legs
,
and
a
rough
voice
,
and
a
heavy
basket
on
his
head
that
crushed
his
hat
into
a
mere
black
muffin
,
came
crying
flowers
down
Princess
's
Place
,
making
his
timid
little
roots
of
daisies
shudder
in
the
vibration
of
every
yell
he
gave
,
as
though
he
had
been
an
ogre
,
hawking
little
children
<EOS>
,
summer
recollections
were
so
strong
upon
Miss
Tox
,
that
she
shook
her
head
,
and
murmured
she
would
be
comparatively
old
before
she
knew
it
---
which
seemed
likely
.
   
<EOS>
In
her
pensive
mood
,
Miss
Tox
's
thoughts
went
wandering
on
Mr
Dombey
's
track
;
probably
because
the
Major
had
returned
home
to
his
lodgings
opposite
,
and
had
just
bowed
to
her
from
his
window
.
<EOS>
What
other
reason
could
Miss
Tox
have
for
connecting
Mr
Dombey
with
her
summer
days
and
dandelion
fetters
?
<EOS>
Was
he
more
cheerful
?
<EOS>
thought
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
Was
he
reconciled
to
the
decrees
of
fate
?
<EOS>
Would
he
ever
marry
again
?
<EOS>
and
if
yes
,
whom
?
<EOS>
What
sort
of
person
now
!
  
<EOS>
A
flush
---
it
was
warm
weather
---
overspread
Miss
Tox
's
face
,
as
,
while
entertaining
these
meditations
,
she
turned
her
head
,
and
was
surprised
by
the
reflection
of
her
thoughtful
image
in
the
chimney
-
glass
.
<EOS>
Another
flush
succeeded
when
she
saw
a
little
carriage
drive
into
Princess
's
Place
,
and
make
straight
for
her
own
door
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
arose
,
took
up
her
scissors
hastily
,
and
so
coming
,
at
last
,
to
the
plants
,
was
very
busy
with
them
when
Mrs
Chick
entered
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
my
sweetest
friend
!
"
exclaimed
Miss
Tox
,
with
open
arms
.
  
<EOS>
A
little
stateliness
was
mingled
with
Miss
Tox
's
sweetest
friend
's
demeanour
,
but
she
kissed
Miss
Tox
,
and
said
,
"
<EOS>
Lucretia
,
thank
you
,
I
am
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
the
same
.
<EOS>
Hem
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
was
labouring
under
a
peculiar
little
monosyllabic
cough
;
a
sort
of
primer
,
or
easy
introduction
to
the
art
of
coughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
call
very
early
,
and
how
kind
that
is
,
my
dear
!
"
pursued
Miss
Tox
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
have
you
breakfasted
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Lucretia
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
<EOS>
I
took
an
early
breakfast
"
---
the
good
lady
seemed
curious
on
the
subject
of
Princess
's
Place
,
and
looked
all
round
it
as
she
spoke
---
"
with
my
brother
,
who
has
come
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
better
,
I
trust
,
my
love
,
"
faltered
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
greatly
better
,
thank
you
.
<EOS>
Hem
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Louisa
must
be
careful
of
that
cough
,
"
remarked
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
nothing
,
"
returned
Mrs
Chick
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
merely
change
of
weather
.
<EOS>
We
must
expect
change
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Of
weather
?
"
asked
Miss
Tox
,
in
her
simplicity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
everything
,
"
returned
Mrs
Chick
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
we
must
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
world
of
change
.
<EOS>
Any
one
would
surprise
me
very
much
,
Lucretia
,
and
would
greatly
alter
my
opinion
of
their
understanding
,
if
they
attempted
to
contradict
or
evade
what
is
so
perfectly
evident
.
<EOS>
Change
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mrs
Chick
,
with
severe
philosophy
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
gracious
me
,
what
is
there
that
does
not
change
!
<EOS>
even
the
silkworm
,
who
I
am
sure
might
be
supposed
not
to
trouble
itself
about
such
subjects
,
changes
into
all
sorts
of
unexpected
things
continually
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
Louisa
,
"
said
the
mild
Miss
Tox
,
"
is
ever
happy
in
her
illustrations
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
so
kind
,
Lucretia
,
"
returned
Mrs
Chick
,
a
little
softened
,
"
as
to
say
so
,
and
to
think
so
<EOS>
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
I
hope
neither
of
us
may
ever
have
any
cause
to
lessen
our
opinion
of
the
other
,
Lucretia
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
it
,
"
returned
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
coughed
as
before
,
and
drew
lines
on
the
carpet
with
the
ivory
end
of
her
parasol
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
,
who
had
experience
of
her
fair
friend
,
and
knew
that
under
the
pressure
of
any
slight
fatigue
or
vexation
she
was
prone
to
a
discursive
kind
of
irritability
,
availed
herself
of
the
pause
,
to
change
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
my
dear
Louisa
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
"
but
<EOS>
have
I
caught
sight
of
the
manly
form
of
Mr
Chick
in
the
carriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
there
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
"
but
pray
leave
him
there
.
<EOS>
He
has
his
newspaper
,
and
would
be
quite
contented
for
the
next
two
hours
.
<EOS>
Go
on
with
your
flowers
,
Lucretia
,
and
allow
me
to
sit
here
and
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
Louisa
knows
,
"
observed
Miss
Tox
,
"
that
between
friends
like
ourselves
,
any
approach
to
ceremony
would
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
Therefore
---
"
Therefore
Miss
Tox
finished
the
sentence
,
not
in
words
but
action
;
and
putting
on
her
gloves
again
,
which
she
had
taken
off
,
and
arming
herself
once
more
with
her
scissors
,
began
to
snip
and
clip
among
the
leaves
with
microscopic
industry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Florence
has
returned
home
also
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
after
sitting
silent
for
some
time
,
with
her
head
on
one
side
,
and
her
parasol
sketching
on
the
floor
;
"
and
really
Florence
is
a
great
deal
too
old
now
,
to
continue
to
lead
that
solitary
life
to
which
she
has
been
accustomed
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
is
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
very
little
respect
,
indeed
,
for
anybody
who
could
advocate
a
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
Whatever
my
wishes
might
be
,
I
could
not
respect
them
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
command
our
feelings
to
such
an
extent
as
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
assented
,
without
being
particular
as
to
the
intelligibility
of
the
proposition
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
she
's
a
strange
girl
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
"
and
if
my
brother
Paul
can
not
feel
perfectly
comfortable
in
her
society
,
after
all
the
sad
things
that
have
happened
,
and
<EOS>
all
the
terrible
disappointments
that
have
been
undergone
,
then
,
what
is
the
reply
?
<EOS>
That
he
must
make
an
effort
.
<EOS>
That
he
is
bound
to
make
an
effort
.
<EOS>
We
have
always
been
a
family
remarkable
for
effort
.
<EOS>
Paul
is
at
the
head
of
the
family
;
almost
the
only
representative
of
it
left
---
for
what
am
I
---
I
am
of
no
consequence
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
love
,
"
remonstrated
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
dried
her
eyes
,
which
were
,
for
the
moment
,
overflowing
;
and
proceeded
:
  
"
<EOS>
And
consequently
he
is
more
than
ever
bound
to
make
an
effort
.
<EOS>
And
though
his
having
done
so
,
comes
upon
me
with
a
sort
of
shock
---
for
mine
is
a
very
weak
and
foolish
nature
;
which
is
anything
but
a
blessing
I
am
sure
;
I
often
wish
my
heart
was
a
marble
slab
,
or
a
paving
-
stone
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
My
sweet
Louisa
,
"
remonstrated
Miss
Tox
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Still
,
it
is
a
triumph
to
me
to
know
that
he
is
so
true
to
himself
,
and
to
his
name
of
Dombey
;
although
,
of
course
,
I
always
knew
he
would
be
.
<EOS>
I
only
hope
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
after
a
pause
,
"
that
she
may
be
worthy
of
the
name
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
filled
a
little
green
watering
-
pot
from
a
jug
,
and
happening
to
look
up
when
she
had
done
so
,
was
so
surprised
by
the
amount
of
expression
Mrs
Chick
had
conveyed
into
her
face
,
and
was
bestowing
upon
her
,
that
she
put
the
little
watering
-
pot
on
the
table
for
the
present
,
and
sat
down
near
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Louisa
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
"
will
it
be
the
least
satisfaction
to
you
,
if
I
venture
to
observe
in
reference
to
that
remark
,
that
I
,
as
a
humble
individual
,
think
your
sweet
niece
in
every
way
most
promising
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
Lucretia
?
"
returned
Mrs
Chick
,
with
increased
stateliness
of
manner
.
<EOS>
"
To
what
remark
of
mine
,
my
dear
,
do
you
refer
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
being
worthy
of
her
name
,
my
love
.
"
replied
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
with
solemn
patience
,
"
I
have
not
expressed
myself
with
clearness
,
Lucretia
,
the
fault
of
course
is
mine
.
<EOS>
There
is
,
perhaps
,
no
reason
why
I
should
express
myself
at
all
,
except
the
intimacy
that
has
subsisted
between
us
,
and
which
I
very
much
hope
,
Lucretia
---
<EOS>
confidently
hope
---
nothing
will
occur
to
disturb
.
<EOS>
Because
,
why
should
I
do
anything
else
?
<EOS>
There
is
no
reason
;
it
would
be
absurd
.
<EOS>
But
I
wish
to
express
myself
clearly
,
Lucretia
;
and
therefore
to
go
back
to
that
remark
,
I
must
beg
to
say
that
it
was
not
intended
to
relate
to
Florence
,
in
any
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Indeed
!
"
returned
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
shortly
and
decisively
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
my
dear
,
"
rejoined
her
meek
friend
;
"
but
I
can
not
have
understood
it
.
<EOS>
I
fear
I
am
dull
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
looked
round
the
room
and
over
the
way
;
at
the
plants
,
at
the
bird
,
at
the
watering
-
pot
,
at
almost
everything
within
view
,
except
Miss
Tox
;
and
finally
dropping
her
glance
upon
Miss
Tox
,
for
a
moment
,
on
its
way
to
the
ground
,
said
,
looking
meanwhile
with
elevated
eyebrows
at
the
carpet
:
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
speak
,
Lucretia
,
of
her
being
worthy
of
the
name
,
I
speak
of
my
brother
Paul
's
second
wife
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
already
said
,
in
effect
,
if
not
in
the
very
words
I
now
use
,
that
it
is
his
intention
to
marry
a
second
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
left
her
seat
in
a
hurry
,
and
returned
to
her
plants
;
clipping
among
the
stems
and
leaves
,
with
as
little
favour
as
a
barber
working
at
so
many
pauper
heads
of
hair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whether
she
will
be
fully
sensible
of
the
distinction
conferred
upon
her
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
in
a
lofty
tone
,
"
is
quite
another
question
.
<EOS>
I
hope
she
may
be
.
<EOS>
We
are
bound
to
think
well
of
one
another
in
this
world
,
and
I
hope
she
may
be
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
advised
with
myself
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
advised
with
,
I
have
no
doubt
my
advice
would
have
been
cavalierly
received
,
and
therefore
it
is
infinitely
better
as
it
is
.
<EOS>
I
much
prefer
it
as
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
,
with
head
bent
down
,
still
clipped
among
the
plants
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
,
with
energetic
shakings
of
her
own
head
from
time
to
time
,
continued
to
hold
forth
,
as
if
in
defiance
of
somebody
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
my
brother
Paul
had
consulted
with
me
,
which
he
sometimes
does
---
or
rather
,
sometimes
used
to
do
;
for
he
will
naturally
do
that
no
more
now
,
and
this
is
a
circumstance
which
I
regard
as
a
relief
from
responsibility
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
hysterically
,
"
for
I
thank
Heaven
<EOS>
I
am
not
jealous
---
"
here
Mrs
Chick
again
shed
tears
:
"
if
my
brother
Paul
had
come
to
me
,
and
had
said
,
"
Louisa
,
what
kind
of
qualities
would
you
advise
me
to
look
out
for
,
in
a
wife
?
<EOS>
"
I
should
certainly
have
answered
,
"
Paul
,
you
must
have
family
,
you
must
have
beauty
,
you
must
have
dignity
,
you
must
have
connexion
.
<EOS>
"
Those
are
the
words
I
should
have
used
.
<EOS>
You
might
have
led
me
to
the
block
immediately
afterwards
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
as
if
that
consequence
were
highly
probable
,
"
but
I
should
have
used
them
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
said
,
"
Paul
!
<EOS>
You
to
marry
a
second
time
without
family
!
<EOS>
You
to
marry
without
beauty
!
<EOS>
You
to
marry
without
dignity
!
<EOS>
You
to
marry
without
connexion!There
is
nobody
in
the
world
,
not
mad
,
who
could
dream
of
daring
to
entertain
such
a
preposterous
idea
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
Miss
Tox
stopped
clipping
;
and
with
her
head
among
the
plants
,
listened
attentively
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
Miss
Tox
thought
there
was
hope
in
this
exordium
,
and
the
warmth
of
Mrs
Chick
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
adopted
this
course
of
argument
,
"
pursued
the
discreet
lady
,
"
because
I
trust
I
am
not
a
fool
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
claim
to
be
considered
a
person
of
superior
intellect
---
though
I
believe
some
people
have
been
extraordinary
enough
to
consider
me
so
;
one
so
little
humoured
as
I
am
,
would
very
soon
be
disabused
of
any
such
notion
;
but
I
trust
I
am
not
a
downright
fool
.
<EOS>
And
to
tell
ME
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
with
ineffable
disdain
,
"
that
my
brother
Paul
Dombey
could
ever
contemplate
the
possibility
of
uniting
himself
to
anybody
<EOS>
---
I
do
n't
care
who
"
---
she
was
more
sharp
and
emphatic
in
that
short
clause
than
in
any
other
part
of
her
discourse
---
"
not
possessing
these
requisites
,
would
be
to
insult
what
understanding
I
have
got
,
as
much
as
if
I
was
to
be
told
that
I
was
born
and
bred
an
elephant
,
which
I
may
be
told
next
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
with
resignation
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
n't
surprise
me
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
expect
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
moment
's
silence
that
ensued
,
Miss
Tox
's
scissors
gave
a
feeble
clip
or
two
:
but
Miss
Tox
's
face
was
still
invisible
,
and
Miss
Tox
's
morning
gown
was
agitated
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
looked
sideways
at
her
,
through
the
intervening
plants
,
and
went
on
to
say
,
in
a
tone
of
bland
conviction
,
and
as
one
dwelling
on
a
point
of
fact
that
hardly
required
to
be
stated
:
  
"
Therefore
,
of
course
my
brother
Paul
has
done
what
was
to
be
expected
of
him
,
and
what
anybody
might
have
foreseen
he
would
do
,
if
he
entered
the
marriage
state
again
.
<EOS>
I
confess
it
takes
me
rather
by
surprise
,
however
gratifying
;
because
when
Paul
went
out
of
town
I
had
no
idea
at
all
that
he
would
form
any
attachment
out
of
town
,
and
he
certainly
had
no
attachment
when
he
left
here
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
seems
to
be
extremely
desirable
in
every
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
the
mother
is
a
most
genteel
and
elegant
creature
,
and
I
have
no
right
whatever
to
dispute
the
policy
of
her
living
with
them
:
which
is
Paul
's
affair
,
not
mine
---
and
as
to
Paul
's
choice
,
herself
,
I
have
only
seen
her
picture
yet
,
but
that
is
beautiful
indeed
.
<EOS>
Her
name
is
beautiful
too
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
shaking
her
head
with
energy
,
and
arranging
herself
in
her
chair;"Edith
<EOS>
is
at
once
uncommon
,
as
it
strike
me
,
and
distinguished
.
<EOS>
Consequently
,
Lucretia
,
I
have
no
doubt
you
will
be
happy
to
hear
that
the
marriage
is
to
take
place
immediately
---
of
course
,
you
will
:
<EOS>
"
great
emphasis
again
:
"
and
that
you
are
delighted
with
this
change
in
the
condition
of
my
brother
,
who
has
shown
you
a
great
deal
of
pleasant
attention
at
various
times
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
made
no
verbal
answer
,
but
took
up
the
little
watering
-
pot
with
a
trembling
hand
,
and
looked
vacantly
round
as
if
considering
what
article
of
furniture
would
be
improved
by
the
contents
.
<EOS>
The
room
door
opening
at
this
crisis
of
Miss
Tox
's
feelings
,
she
started
,
laughed
aloud
,
and
fell
into
the
arms
of
the
person
entering
;
happily
insensible
alike
of
Mrs
Chick
's
indignant
countenance
and
of
the
Major
at
his
window
over
the
way
,
who
had
his
double
-
barrelled
eye
-
glass
in
full
action
,
and
whose
face
and
figure
were
dilated
with
Mephistophelean
joy
.
  
<EOS>
Not
so
the
expatriated
Native
,
amazed
supporter
of
Miss
Tox
's
swooning
form
,
who
,
coming
straight
upstairs
,
with
a
polite
inquiry
touching
Miss
Tox
's
health
(
in
exact
pursuance
of
the
Major
's
malicious
instructions
)
,
had
accidentally
arrived
in
the
very
nick
of
time
to
catch
the
delicate
burden
in
his
arms
,
and
to
receive
the
contents
of
the
little
watering
-
pot
in
his
shoe
;
both
of
which
circumstances
,
coupled
with
his
consciousness
of
being
closely
watched
by
the
wrathful
Major
,
who
had
threatened
the
usual
penalty
in
regard
of
every
bone
in
his
skin
in
case
of
any
failure
,
combined
to
render
him
a
moving
spectacle
of
mental
and
bodily
distress
.
  
<EOS>
For
some
moments
,
this
afflicted
foreigner
remained
clasping
Miss
Tox
to
his
heart
,
with
an
energy
of
action
in
remarkable
opposition
to
his
disconcerted
face
,
while
that
poor
lady
trickled
slowly
down
upon
him
the
very
last
sprinklings
of
the
little
watering
-
pot
,
as
if
he
were
a
delicate
exotic
(
which
indeed
he
was
)
,
and
might
be
almost
expected
to
blow
while
the
gentle
rain
descended
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
,
at
length
recovering
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
interpose
,
commanded
him
to
drop
Miss
Tox
upon
the
sofa
and
withdraw
;
and
the
exile
promptly
obeying
,
she
applied
herself
to
promote
Miss
Tox
's
recovery
.
  
<EOS>
But
none
of
that
gentle
concern
which
usually
characterises
the
daughters
of
Eve
in
their
tending
of
each
other
;
none
of
that
freemasonry
in
fainting
,
by
which
they
are
generally
bound
together
in
a
mysterious
bond
of
sisterhood
;
was
visible
in
Mrs
Chick
's
demeanour
.
<EOS>
Rather
like
the
executioner
who
restores
the
victim
to
sensation
previous
to
proceeding
with
the
torture
(
or
was
wo
nt
to
do
so
,
in
the
good
old
times
for
which
all
true
men
wear
perpetual
mourning
)
,
did
Mrs
Chick
administer
the
smelling
-
bottle
,
the
slapping
on
the
hands
,
the
dashing
of
cold
water
on
the
face
,
and
the
other
proved
remedies
.
<EOS>
And
when
,
at
length
,
Miss
Tox
opened
her
eyes
,
and
gradually
became
restored
to
animation
and
consciousness
<EOS>
,
Mrs
Chick
drew
off
as
form
a
criminal
,
and
reversing
the
precedent
of
the
murdered
king
of
Denmark
,
regarded
her
more
in
anger
than
in
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lucretia
!
"
said
Mrs
Chick
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
attempt
to
disguise
what
I
feel
.
<EOS>
My
eyes
are
opened
,
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
believed
this
,
if
a
Saint
had
told
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
foolish
to
give
way
to
faintness
,
"
Miss
Tox
faltered
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
better
presently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
better
presently
,
Lucretia
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Mrs
Chick
,
with
exceeding
scorn
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
suppose
I
am
blind
?
<EOS>
Do
you
imagine
I
am
in
my
second
childhood
?
<EOS>
No
,
Lucretia!I
am
obliged
to
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
directed
an
imploring
,
helpless
kind
of
look
towards
her
friend
,
and
put
her
handkerchief
before
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
any
one
had
told
me
this
yesterday
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
with
majesty
,
"
or
even
half
-
an
-
hour
ago
,
I
should
have
been
tempted
,
I
almost
believe
,
to
strike
them
to
the
earth
,
<EOS>
Lucretia
Tox
,
my
eyes
are
opened
to
you
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
The
scales
:
"
here
Mrs
Chick
cast
down
an
imaginary
pair
,
such
as
are
commonly
used
in
grocers
'
shops
:
"
have
fallen
from
my
sight
.
<EOS>
The
blindness
of
my
confidence
is
past
,
Lucretia
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
abused
and
played
upon
,
and
evasion
is
quite
out
of
the
question
now
,
I
assure
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
to
what
do
you
allude
so
cruelly
,
my
love
?
"
asked
Miss
Tox
,
through
her
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lucretia
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
"
ask
your
own
heart
.
<EOS>
I
must
entreat
you
not
to
address
me
by
any
such
familiar
term
as
you
have
just
used
,
if
you
please

<EOS>
I
have
some
self

respect
left

think
otherwise

<EOS>
"
Oh

Louisa

cried
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
speak
to
me
like
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
speak
to
you
like
that

"
<EOS>
retorted
Mrs
Chick
,
who
,
in
default
of
having
any
particular
argument
to
sustain
herself
upon
,
relied
principally
on
such
repetitions
for
her
most
withering
effects
.
<EOS>
"
Like
that
!
<EOS>
You
may
well
say
like
that
,
indeed
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
sobbed
pitifully
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
idea
!
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
"
of
your
having
basked
at
my
brother
's
fireside
,
like
a
serpent
,
and
would
yourself
,
through
me
,
almost
into
his
confidence
,
Lucretia
,
that
you
might
,
in
secret
,
entertain
designs
upon
him
,
and
dare
to
aspire
to
contemplate
the
possibility
of
his
uniting
himself
to
you
!
<EOS>
Why
,
it
is
and
idea
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
with
sarcastic
dignity
,
"
the
absurdity
of
which
almost
relieves
its
treachery
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Pray
,
Louisa

"
urged
Miss
Tox
,
"
do
not
say
such
dreadful
things

<EOS>
"
Dreadful
things

repeated
Mrs
Chick
.
"
<EOS>
Dreadful
things!Is
it
not
a
fact

Lucretia
,
that
you
have
just
now
been
unable

command
your
feelings

before
me

whose
eyes
you
had
so
completely
closed

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
no
complaint

sobbed
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
nothing

<EOS>
If
I
have
been
a
little
overpowered
by
your
news

Louisa

and
have
ever
had
any
lingering
thought
that
Mr
Dombey
was
inclined
to
be
particular
towards
me

surely
you
will
not
condemn
me

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
going
to
say

"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
addressing
herself
to
the
whole
of
the
furniture
,
in
a
comprehensive
glance
of
resignation
and
appeal
,
"
She
is
going

it

Miss

Nor

But

in

Yes

cried
Mrs

,
looking
round
the
room
with
a
prophetic
smile

"
that

Mrs

In

Miss

,

and
only
in
my
own
defence
against
your
unkind
words

my
dear
Louisa
<EOS>

I
would
merely
ask
you
if
you
have
n't
often
favoured
such
a
fancy

even
said
it

happen

for
anything

tell

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
point

"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
rising
,
not
as
if
she
were
going
to
stop
at
the
floor
,
but
as
if
she
were
about
to
soar
up
,
high
,
into
her
native
skies

"
beyond
which
endurance
becomes
ridiculous

not
culpable

<EOS>
I
can
bear
much

not
too
much

<EOS>
What
spell
was
on
me
when
I
came
into
this
house
this
day
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know

I
had
a
presentiment
---
a
dark
presentiment
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
with
a
shiver
,
"
that
something
was
going
to
happen
.
<EOS>
Well
may
I
have
had
that
foreboding
,
Lucretia
,
when
my
confidence
of
many
years
is
destroyed
in
an
instant
,
when
my
eyes
are
opened
all
at
once
,
and
when
I
find
you
revealed
in
your
true
colours
.
<EOS>
Lucretia
,
I
have
been
mistaken
in
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
better
for
us
both
that
this
subject
should
end
here
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
well
,
and
I
shall
ever
wish
you
well
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
an
individual
who
desires
to
be
true
to
herself
in
her
own
poor
position
,
whatever
that
position
may
be
,
or
may
not
be
---
and
as
the
sister
of
my
brother
---
and
as
the
sister
-
in
-
law
of
my
brother
's
wife
---
and
as
a
connexion
by
marriage
of
my
brother
's
wife
's
mother
---
may
I
be
permitted
to
add
,
as
a
Dombey
?
<EOS>
---
I
can
wish
you
nothing
else
but
good
morning
.
"
  
<EOS>
These
words
,
delivered
with
cutting
suavity
,
tempered
and
chastened
by
a
lofty
air
of
moral
rectitude
,
carried
the
speaker
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
There
she
inclined
her
head
in
a
ghostly
and
statue
-
like
manner
,
and
so
withdrew
to
her
carriage
,
to
seek
comfort
and
consolation
in
the
arms
of
Mr
Chick
her
lord
.
  
<EOS>
Figuratively
speaking
,
that
is
to
say
:
for
the
arms
of
Mr
Chick
were
full
of
his
newspaper
.
<EOS>
Neither
did
that
gentleman
address
his
eyes
towards
his
wife
otherwise
than
by
stealth
.
<EOS>
Neither
did
he
offer
any
consolation
whatever
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
sat
reading
,
and
humming
fag
ends
of
tunes
,
and
sometimes
glancing
furtively
at
her
without
delivering
himself
of
a
word
,
good
,
bad
,
or
indifferent
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Mrs
Chick
sat
swelling
and
bridling
,
and
tossing
her
head
,
as
if
she
were
still
repeating
that
solemn
formula
of
farewell
to
Lucretia
Tox
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
she
said
aloud
,
"
Oh
the
extent
to
which
her
eyes
had
been
opened
that
day
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
which
your
eyes
have
been
opened
,
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Mr
Chick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
talk
to
me
!
"
said
Mrs
Chick
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
can
bear
to
see
me
in
this
state
,
and
not
ask
me
what
the
matter
is
,
you
had
better
hold
your
tongue
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
,
my
dear
?
"
asked
Mr
Chick
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
think
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
in
a
state
of
soliloquy
,
"
that
she
should
ever
have
conceived
the
base
idea
of
connecting
herself
with
our
family
by
a
marriage
with
Paul
!
<EOS>
To
think
that
when
she
was
playing
at
horses
with
that
dear
child
who
is
now
in
his
grave
---
I
never
liked
it
at
the
time
---
she
should
have
been
hiding
such
a
double
-
faced
design
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
she
was
never
afraid
that
something
would
happen
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
fortunate
if
nothing
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
thought
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Chick
slowly
,
after
rubbing
the
bridge
of
his
nose
for
some
time
with
his
newspaper
,
"
that
you
had
gone
on
the
same
tack
yourself
,
all
along
,
until
this
morning
;
and
had
thought
it
would
be
a
convenient
thing
enough
,
if
it
could
have
been
brought
about
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
instantly
burst
into
tears
,
and
told
Mr
Chick
that
if
he
wished
to
trample
upon
her
with
his
boots
,
he
had
better
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
with
Lucretia
Tox
I
have
done
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
after
abandoning
herself
to
her
feelings
for
some
minutes
,
to
Mr
Chick
's
great
terror
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
bear
to
resign
Paul
's
confidence
in
favour
of
one
<EOS>
who
,
I
hope
and
trust
,
may
be
deserving
of
it
,
and
with
whom
he
has
a
perfect
right
to
replace
poor
Fanny
if
he
chooses
;
I
can
bear
to
be
informed
,
in
Paul
's
cool
manner
,
of
such
a
change
in
his
plans
,
and
never
to
be
consulted
until
all
is
settled
and
determined
;
but
deceit
I
can
not
bear
,
and
with
Lucretia
Tox
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
It
is
better
as
it
is
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
piously
;
"
much
better
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
a
long
time
before
I
could
have
accommodated
myself
comfortably
with
her
,
after
this
;
and
I
really
do
n't
know
,
as
Paul
is
going
to
be
very
grand
,
and
these
are
people
of
condition
,
that
she
would
have
been
quite
presentable
,
and
might
not
have
compromised
myself
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
providence
in
everything
;
everything
works
for
the
best
;
I
have
been
triedto
-
day
,
but
,
upon
the
whole
I
do
n't
regret
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
which
Christian
spirit
,
Mrs
Chick
dried
her
eyes
,
and
smoothed
her
lap
,
and
sat
as
became
a
person
calm
under
a
great
wrong
.
<EOS>
Mr
Chick
,
feeling
his
unworthiness
no
doubt
,
took
an
early
opportunity
of
being
set
down
at
a
street
corner
and
walking
away
,
whistling
,
with
his
shoulders
very
much
raised
,
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
.
  
<EOS>
While
poor
excommunicated
Miss
Tox
,
who
,
if
she
were
a
fawner
and
toad
-
eater
,
was
at
least
an
honest
and
a
constant
one
,
and
had
ever
borne
a
faithful
friendship
towards
her
impeacher
,
and
had
been
truly
absorbed
and
swallowed
up
in
devotion
to
the
magnificence
of
Mr
Dombey
---
while
poor
excommunicated
Miss
Tox
watered
her
plants
with
her
tears
,
and
felt
that
it
was
winter
in
Princess
's
Place

The
Interval
before
the
Marriage
 
<EOS>
ALTHOUGH
<EOS>
the
enchanted
house
was
not
more
,
and
the
working
world
had
broken
into
it
,
and
was
hammering
and
crashing
and
tramping
up
and
down
stairs
all
day
long
,
keeping
Diogenes
in
an
incessant
paroxysm
of
barking
,
from
sunrise
to
sunset
---
evidently
convinced
that
his
enemy
had
got
the
better
of
him
at
last
,
and
was
then
sacking
the
premises
in
triumphant
defiance
<EOS>
---
there
was
,
at
first
,
no
other
great
change
in
the
method
of
Florence
's
life
.
<EOS>
At
night
,
when
the
work
-
people
went
away
,
the
house
was
dreary
and
deserted
again
;
and
Florence
,
listening
to
their
voices
echoing
through
the
hall
and
staircase
as
they
departed
,
pictured
to
herself
the
cheerful
homes
to
which
they
were
returning
,
and
the
children
who
were
waiting
for
them
,
and
was
glad
to
think
that
they
were
merry
and
well
pleased
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
She
welcomed
back
the
evening
silence
as
on
old
friend
,
but
it
came
now
with
an
altered
face
,
and
looked
more
kindly
on
her
.
<EOS>
Fresh
hope
was
in
it
.
<EOS>
The
beautiful
lady
who
had
soothed
and
caressed
her
,
in
the
very
room
in
which
her
heart
had
been
so
wrung
,
was
a
spirit
of
promise
to
her
.
<EOS>
Soft
shadows
of
the
bright
life
dawning
,
when
her
father
's
affection
should
be
gradually
won
,
and
all
,
or
much
should
be
restored
,
of
what
she
had
lost
on
the
dark
day
when
a
mother
's
love
had
faded
with
a
mother
's
last
breath
on
her
cheek
,
moved
about
her
in
the
twilight
and
were
welcome
company
.
<EOS>
Peeping
at
the
rosy
children
her
neighbours
,
it
was
a
new
and
precious
sensation
to
think
that
they
might
soon
speak
together
and
know
each
other
;
when
she
would
not
fear
,
as
of
old
,
to
show
herself
before
them
,
lest
they
should
be
grieved
to
see
her
in
her
black
dress
sitting
there
alone
!
  
<EOS>
In
her
thoughts
of
her
new
mother
,
and
in
the
love
and
trust
overflowing
her
pure
heart
towards
her
,
Florence
loved
her
own
dead
mother
more
and
more
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
fear
of
setting
up
a
rival
in
her
breast
.
<EOS>
The
new
flower
sprang
from
the
deep
-
planted
and
long
-
cherished
root
,
she
knew
.
<EOS>
Every
gentle
word
that
had
fallen
from
the
lips
of
the
beautiful
lady
,
sounded
to
Florence
like
an
echo
of
the
voice
long
hushed
and
silent
.
<EOS>
How
could
she
love
that
memory
less
for
living
tenderness
,
when
it
was
her
memory
of
all
parental
tenderness
and
love
!
  
<EOS>
Florence
was
,
one
day
,
sitting
reading
in
her
room
,
and
thinking
of
the
lady
and
her
promised
visit
soon
---
for
her
book
turned
on
a
kindred
subject
---
<EOS>
when
,
raising
her
eyes
,
she
saw
her
standing
in
the
doorway
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mama
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Florence
,
joyfully
meeting
her
.
<EOS>
"
Come
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
Mama
yet
,
"
returned
the
lady
,
with
a
serious
smile
,
as
she
encircled
Florence
's
neck
with
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
very
soon
to
be
,
"
cried
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
soon
now
,
Florence
:
very
soon
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
bent
her
head
a
little
,
so
as
to
press
the
blooming
cheek
of
Florence
against
her
own
,
and
for
some
few
moments
remained
thus
silent
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
very
tender
in
her
manner
,
that
Florence
was
even
more
sensible
of
it
than
on
the
first
occasion
of
their
meeting
.
  
<EOS>
She
led
Florence
to
a
chair
beside
her
,
and
sat
down
:
Florence
looking
in
her
face
,
quite
wondering
at
its
beauty
,
and
willingly
leaving
her
hand
in
hers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
been
alone
,
Florence
,
since
I
was
here
last
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
!
"
smiled
Florence
,
hastily
.
  
<EOS>
She
hesitated
and
cast
down
her
eyes
;
for
her
new
Mama
was
very
earnest
in
her
look
,
and
the
look
was
intently
and
thoughtfully
fixed
upon
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
---
am
used
to
be
alone
,
"
said
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mind
it
at
all
.
<EOS>
Di
and
I
pass
whole
days
together
,
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
Florence
might
have
said
,
whole
weeks
and
months
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Di
your
maid
,
love
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dog
,
Mama
,
"
said
Florence
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
Susan
is
my
maid
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
these
are
your
rooms
,
"
said
Edith
,
looking
round
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
shown
these
rooms
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
them
improved
,
Florence
.
<EOS>
They
shall
be
made
the
prettiest
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
might
change
them
,
Mama
,
"
returned
Florence
;
"
there
is
one
up
stairs
<EOS>
I
should
like
much
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
this
not
high
enough
,
dear
girl
?
"
asked
Edith
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
other
was
my
brother
's
room
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
and
I
am
very
fond
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
spoken
to
Papa
about
it
when
I
came
home
,
and
found
the
workmen
here
,
and
everything
changing
:
<EOS>
but
---
"
  
Florence
dropped
her
eyes
,
lest
the
same
look
should
make
her
falter
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
---
but
I
was
afraid
it
might
distress
him
;
and
as
you
said
you
would
be
here
again
soon
,
Mama
,
and
are
the
mistress
of
everything
,
I
determined
to
take
courage
and
ask
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
sat
looking
at
her
,
with
her
brilliant
eyes
intent
upon
her
face
,
until
Florence
raising
her
own
,
she
,
in
her
turn
,
withdrew
her
gaze
,
and
turned
it
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
that
Florence
thought
how
different
this
lady
's
beauty
was
,
from
what
she
had
supposed
.
<EOS>
She
had
thought
it
of
a
proud
and
lofty
kind
;
yet
her
manner
was
so
subdued
and
gentle
,
that
if
she
had
been
of
Florence
's
own
age
and
character
,
it
scarcely
could
have
invited
confidence
more
.
  
<EOS>
Except
when
a
constrained
and
singular
reserve
crept
over
her
;
and
then
she
seemed
(
but
Florence
hardly
understood
this
,
though
she
could
not
choose
but
notice
it
,
and
think
about
it
)
as
if
she
were
humbled
before
Florence
,
and
ill
at
ease
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
said
that
she
was
not
her
Mama
yet
,
and
when
Florence
had
called
her
the
mistress
of
everything
there
,
this
change
in
her
was
quick
and
startling
;
and
now
,
while
the
eyes
of
Florence
rested
on
her
face
,
she
sat
as
though
she
would
have
shrunk
and
hidden
from
her
,
rather
than
as
one
about
to
love
and
cherish
her
,
in
right
of
such
a
near
connexion
.
  
<EOS>
She
gave
Florence
her
ready
promise
,
about
her
new
room
,
and
said
she
would
give
directions
about
it
herself
.
<EOS>
She
then
asked
some
questions
concerning
poor
Paul
;
and
when
they
had
sat
in
conversation
for
some
time
,
told
Florence
she
had
come
to
take
her
to
her
own
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
come
to
London
now
,
my
mother
and
I
,
"
said
Edith
,
"
and
you
shall
stay
with
us
until
I
am
married
.
<EOS>
I
wish
that
we
should
know
and
trust
each
other
,
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
said
Florence
,
"
dear
Mama
.
<EOS>
How
much
I
thank
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
say
now
,
for
it
may
be
the
best
opportunity
,
"
continued
Edith
,
looking
round
to
see
that
they
were
quite
alone
,
and
speaking
in
a
lower
voice
,
"
that
when
I
am
married
,
and
have
gone
away
for
some
weeks
,
I
shall
be
easier
at
heart
if
you
will
come
home
here
.
<EOS>
No
matter
who
invites
you
to
stay
elsewhere
,
come
home
here
.
<EOS>
It
is
better
to
be
alone
then
---
what
I
would
say
is
,
"
she
added
,
checking
herself
,
"
<EOS>
that
I
know
well
you
are
best
at
home
,
dear
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
come
home
on
the
very
day
,
Mama

<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
so
.
<EOS>
I
rely
on
that
promise
.
<EOS>
Now
,
prepare
to
come
with
me
,
dear
girl
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
me
down
stairs
when
you
are
ready
.
"
   
<EOS>
Slowly
and
<EOS>
thoughtfully
did
Edith
wander
alone
through
the
mansion
of
which
she
was
so
soon
to
be
the
lady
:
and
little
heed
took
she
of
all
the
elegance
and
splendour
<EOS>
it
began
to
display
.
<EOS>
The
same
indomitable
haughtiness
of
soul
,
the
same
proud
scorn
expressed
in
eye
and
lip
,
the
same
fierce
beauty
,
only
tamed
by
a
sense
of
its
own
little
worth
,
and
of
the
little
worth
of
everything
around
it
,
went
through
the
grand
saloons
and
halls
,
that
had
got
loose
among
the
shady
trees
,
and
raged
and
rent
themselves
.
<EOS>
The
mimic
roses
on
the
walls
and
floors
were
set
round
with
sharp
thorns
,
that
tore
her
breast
;
in
every
scrap
of
gold
so
dazzling
to
the
eye
,
she
saw
some
hateful
atom
of
her
purchase
-
money
;
the
broad
high
mirrors
showed
her
,
at
full
length
,
a
women
with
a
noble
quality
yet
dwelling
in
her
nature
,
who
was
too
false
to
her
better
self
,
and
too
debased
and
lost
,
to
save
herself
.
<EOS>
She
believed
that
all
this
was
so
plain
,
more
or
less
,
to
all
eyes
,
that
she
had
no
resource
or
power
of
self
-
assertion
but
in
pride
:
and
with
this
pride
,
which
tortured
her
own
heart
night
and
day
,
she
fought
her
fate
out
,
braved
it
,
and
defied
it
.
  
<EOS>
Was
this
the
woman
whom
Florence
---
an
innocent
girl
,
strong
only
in
her
earnestness
and
simple
truth
---
could
so
impress
and
quell
,
that
by
her
side
she
was
another
creature
,
with
her
tempest
of
passion
hushed
,
and
<EOS>
her
very
pride
itself
subdued
?
<EOS>
Was
this
the
woman
who
now
sat
beside
her
in
a
carriage
,
with
her
arms
entwined
,
and
who
,
while
she
courted
and
entreated
her
to
love
and
trust
her
,
drew
her
fair
head
to
nestle
on
her
breast
,
and
would
have
laid
down
life
to
shield
it
from
wrong
or
harm
?
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
Edith
!
<EOS>
it
were
well
to
die
,
indeed
,
at
such
a
time!Better
and
happier
far
,
perhaps
,
to
die
so
,
Edith
,
than
to
live
on
to
the
end
!
  
<EOS>
The
Honourable
Mrs
Skewton
,
who
was
thinking
of
anything
rather
than
of
such
sentiments
---
for
,
like
many
genteel
persons
who
have
existed
at
various
times
,
she
set
her
face
against
death
altogether
,
and
objected
to
the
mention
of
any
such
low
and
levelling
upstart
---
had
borrowed
a
house
in
Brook
Street
,
Grosvenor
Square
,
from
a
stately
relative
(
one
of
the
Feenix
brood
)
,
who
was
out
of
town
,
and
who
did
not
object
to
lending
it
,
in
the
handsomest
manner
,
for
nuptial
purposes
,
as
the
loan
implied
his
final
release
and
acquittance
from
all
further
loans
and
gifts
to
Mrs
Skewton
and
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
It
being
necessary
for
the
credit
of
the
family
to
make
a
handsome
appearance
at
such
a
time
,
Mrs
Skewton
,
with
the
assistance
of
an
accommodating
tradesman
resident
in
the
parish
of
Mary
-
le
-
bone
,
who
lent
out
all
sorts
of
articles
to
the
nobility
and
gentry
,
from
a
service
of
plate
to
an
army
of
foot
-
men
,
clapped
into
this
house
a
silver
-
headed
butler
(
who
was
charged
extra
on
that
account
,
as
having
the
appearance
of
an
ancient
family
retainer
)
,
two
very
tall
young
men
in
livery
,
and
a
select
staff
of
kitchen
-
servants
;
so
that
a
legend
arose
,
downstairs
,
that
Withers
the
page
,
released
at
once
from
his
numerous
household
duties
,
and
from
the
propulsion
of
the
wheeled
-
chair
(
inconsistent
with
the
metropolis
)
,
<EOS>
had
been
several
times
observed
to
rub
his
eyes
and
pinch
his
limbs
,
as
if
he
misdoubted
his
having
overslept
himself
at
the
Leamington
milkman
's
,
and
being
still
in
a
celestial
dream
.
<EOS>
A
variety
of
requisites
in
plate
and
china
being
also
conveyed
to
the
same
establishment
from
the
same
convenient
source
,
with
several
miscellaneous
articles
,
including
a
neat
chariot
and
a
pair
of
bays
,
Mrs
Skewton
cushioned
herself
on
the
principal
sofa
,
in
the
Cleopatra
attitude
,
and
held
her
court
in
fair
state
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
,
"
said
Mr
Skewton
,
on
the
entrance
of
her
daughter
and
her
charge
,
"
is
my
charming
Florence
?
<EOS>
You
must
come
and
kiss
me
,
Florence
,
if
you
please
,
my
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
Florence
was
timidly
stooping
to
pick
out
a
place
in
the
white
part
of
Mrs
Skewton
's
face
,
when
that
lady
presented
her
ear
,
and
relieved
her
of
her
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Edith
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
positively
,
I
---
stand
a
little
more
in
the
light
,
my
sweetest
Florence
,
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
blushingly
complied
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
remember
,
dearest
Edith
,
"
said
her
mother
,
"
what
you
were
when
you
were
about
the
same
age
as
our
exceedingly
precious
Florence
,
or
a
few
years
younger
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
long
forgotten
,
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
For
positively
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
I
do
think
that
I
see
a
decided
resemblance
to
what
you
were
then
,
in
our
extremely
fascinating
young
friend
.
<EOS>
And
it
shows
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
in
a
lower
voice
,
which
conveyed
her
opinion
that
Florence
was
in
a
very
unfinished
state
,
"
what
cultivation
will
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
does
,
indeed
,
"
was
Edith
's
stern
reply
.
  
<EOS>
Her
mother
eyed
her
sharply
for
a
moment
,
and
feeling
herself
on
unsafe
ground
,
said
,
as
a
diversion
:
  
<EOS>
"
My
charming
Florence
,
you
must
come
and
kiss
me
once
more
,
if
you
please
,
my
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
complied
,
of
course
,
and
again
imprinted
her
lips
or
Mrs
Skewton
's
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
have
heard
,
<EOS>
no
doubt
,
my
darling
pet
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
detaining
her
hand
,
"
that
your
Papa
,
whom
we
all
perfectly
adore
and
dote
upon
,
is
to
be
married
to
my
dearest
Edith
this
day
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
it
would
be
very
soon
,
"
returned
Florence
,
"
but
not
exactly
when
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
darling
Edith
,
"
urged
her
mother
,
gaily
,
"
is
it
possible
you
have
not
told
Florence
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
tell
Florence
?
"
<EOS>
She
returned
,
so
suddenly
and
harshly
,
that
Florence
could
scarcely
believe
it
was
the
same
voice
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
then
told
Florence
,
as
another
and
safer
diversion
,
that
her
father
was
coming
to
dinner
,
and
that
he
would
no
doubt
be
charmingly
surprised
to
see
her
;
as
he
had
spoken
last
night
of
dressing
in
the
City
,
and
had
known
nothing
of
Edith
's
design
,
the
execution
of
which
,
according
to
Mrs
Skewton
's
expectation
,
would
throw
him
into
a
perfect
ecstasy
.
<EOS>
Florence
was
troubled
to
hear
this
;
and
her
distress
became
so
keen
,
as
the
dinner
-
hour
approached
,
that
if
she
had
known
how
to
frame
an
entreaty
to
be
suffered
to
return
home
,
without
involving
her
father
in
her
explanation
,
she
would
have
hurried
back
on
foot
,
bareheaded
,
breathless
,
and
alone
,
rather
than
incur
the
risk
of
meeting
his
displeasure
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
time
drew
nearer
,
she
could
hardly
breathe
.
<EOS>
She
dared
not
approach
a
window
,
lest
he
should
see
her
from
the
street
.
<EOS>
She
dared
not
go
up
stairs
to
hide
her
emotion
,
lest
,
in
passing
out
at
the
door
,
she
should
meet
him
unexpectedly
;
besides
which
dread
,
she
left
as
though
she
never
could
come
back
again
if
she
were
summoned
to
his
presence
.
<EOS>
In
this
conflict
of
fears
,
she
was
sitting
by
Cleopatra
's
couch
,
endeavouring
to
understand
and
to
reply
to
the
bald
discourse
of
that
lady
,
when
she
heard
his
foot
upon
the
stair
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
him
now
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Florence
,
starting
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
coming
!
"
  
<EOS>
Cleopatra
,
who
in
her
juvenility
was
always
playfully
disposed
,
and
who
in
her
self
-
engrossment
did
not
trouble
herself
about
the
nature
of
this
agitation
,
pushed
Florence
behind
her
couch
,
and
dropped
a
shawl
over
her
,
preparatory
to
giving
Mr
Dombey
a
rapture
of
surprise
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
quickly
done
,
that
in
a
moment
Florence
heard
his
awful
step
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
He
saluted
his
intended
mother
-
in
-
law
,
and
his
intended
bride
.
<EOS>
The
strange
sound
of
his
voice
thrilled
through
the
whole
frame
of
his
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Dombey
,
"
said
Cleopatra
,
"
come
here
and
tell
me
how
your
pretty
Florence
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Florence
is
very
well
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
advancing
towards
the
couch
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
home
?
"
  
"
At
home
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Dombey
,
"
returned
Cleopatra
,
with
bewitching
vivacity
;
"
now
are
you
sure
you
are
not
deceiving
me
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
my
dearest
Edith
will
say
to
me
when
I
make
such
a
declaration
,
but
upon
my
honour
I
am
afraid
you
are
the
falsest
of
men
,
my
dear
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Though
he
had
been
;
and
had
been
detected
on
the
spot
,
in
the
most
enormous
falsehood
that
was
ever
said
or
done
;
he
could
hardly
have
been
more
disconcerted
than
he
was
,
when
Mrs
Skewton
plucked
the
shawl
away
,
and
Florence
,
pale
and
trembling
,
rose
before
him
like
a
ghost
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
yet
recovered
his
presence
of
mind
,
when
Florence
had
run
up
to
him
,
clasped
her
hands
round
his
neck
,
kissed
his
face
,
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
looked
round
as
if
to
refer
the
matter
to
somebody
else
,
but
Edith
had
gone
after
Florence
,
instantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
confess
,
my
dear
Dombey
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
giving
him
her
hand
,
"
that
you
never
were
more
surprised
and
pleased
in
your
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
was
more
surprised
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
pleased
,
my
dearest
Dombey
?
"
returned
Mrs
Skewton
,
holding
up
her
fan
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
---
yes
,
I
am
exceedingly
glad
to
meet
Florence
here
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
consider
gravely
about
it
for
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
more
decidedly
,
"
Yes
,
I
really
am
very
glad
indeed
to
meet
Florence
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wonder
how
she
comes
here
?
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
do
n't
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Edith
,
perhaps
---
"
suggested
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
wicked
guesser
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Cleopatra
,
shaking
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
cunning
,
cunning
man
!
<EOS>
One
should
n't
tell
these
things
;
your
sex
,
my
dear
Dombey
,
are
so
vain
,
and
so
apt
to
abuse
our
weaknesses
;
but
you
know
my
open
soul
---
very
well
;
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
addressed
to
one
of
the
very
tall
young
men
who
announced
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
Edith
,
my
dear
Dombey
,
"
she
continued
in
a
whisper
,
"
when
she
can
not
have
you
near
her
---
and
as
I
tell
her
,
she
can
not
expect
that
always
---
will
at
least
have
near
her
something
or
somebody
belonging
to
you
.
<EOS>
Well
,
how
extremely
natural
that
is
!
<EOS>
And
in
this
spirit
,
nothing
would
keep
her
from
riding
off
to
-
day
to
fetch
our
darling
Florence
.
<EOS>
Well
,
how
excessively
charming
that
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
waited
for
an
answer
,
Mr
Dombey
answered
,
"
Eminently
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
,
my
dear
Dombey
,
for
that
proof
of
heart
!
"
cried
Cleopatra
,
squeezing
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
growing
too
serious!Take
me
down
stairs
,
like
an
angel
,
and
let
us
see
what
these
people
intend
to
give
us
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
Bless
you
,
dear
Dombey
!
"
  
<EOS>
Cleopatra
skipping
off
her
couch
with
tolerable
briskness
,
after
the
last
benediction
,
Mr
Dombey
took
her
arm
in
his
and
led
her
ceremoniously
down
stairs
;
one
of
the
very
tall
young
men
on
hire
,
whose
organ
of
veneration
was
imperfectly
developed
,
thrusting
his
tongue
into
his
cheek
,
for
the
entertainment
of
the
other
very
tall
young
man
on
hire
,
as
the
couple
turned
into
the
dining
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
and
Edith
were
already
there
,
and
sitting
side
by
side
.
<EOS>
Florence
would
have
risen
when
her
father
entered
,
to
resign
her
chair
to
him
;
but
Edith
openly
put
her
hand
upon
her
arm
,
and
Mr
Dombey
took
an
opposite
place
at
the
round
table
.
  
<EOS>
The
conversation
was
almost
entirely
sustained
by
Mrs
Skewton
.
<EOS>
Florence
hardly
dared
to
raise
her
eyes
,
lest
they
should
reveal
the
traces
of
tears
;
far
less
dared
to
speak
;
and
Edith
never
uttered
one
word
,
unless
in
answer
to
a
question
.
<EOS>
Verily
,
Cleopatra
worked
hard
,
for
the
establishment
that
was
so
nearly
clutched
;
and
verily
it
should
have
been
a
rich
one
to
reward
her
!
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
your
preparations
are
nearly
finished
at
last
,
my
dear
Dombey
?
<EOS>
"
said
Cleopatra
,
when
the
dessert
was
put
upon
the
table
,
and
the
silver
-
headed
butler
had
withdrawn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Even
the
lawyers
'
preparations
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
madam
,
"
replied
Mr
Dombey
;
"
the
deed
of
settlement
,
the
professional
gentlemen
inform
me
,
is
now
ready
,
and
as
I
was
mentioning
to
you
,
<EOS>
Edith
has
only
to
do
us
the
favour
to
suggest
her
own
time
for
its
execution
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
sat
like
a
handsome
statue
;
as
cold
,
as
silent
,
and
as
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
love
,
"
said
Cleopatra
,
"
do
you
hear
what
Mr
Dombey
says
?
<EOS>
Ah
,
my
dear
Dombey
!
"
<EOS>
aside
to
that
gentleman
,
"
how
her
absence
,
as
the
time
approaches
,
reminds
me
of
the
days
,
when
that
most
agreeable
of
creatures
,
her
papa
,
was
in
your
situation
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
suggest
.
<EOS>
It
shall
be
when
you
please
,
"
said
Edith
,
scarcely
looking
over
the
table
at
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
?
"
suggested
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Or
would
next
day
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
suit
your
engagements
better
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
engagements
.
<EOS>
I
am
always
at
your
disposal
.
<EOS>
Let
it
be
when
you
like
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
engagements
,
my
dear
Edith
!
"
remonstrated
her
mother
,
"
when
you
are
in
a
most
terrible
state
of
flurry
all
day
long
,
and
have
a
thousand
and
one
appointments
with
all
sorts
of
tradespeople
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
of
your
making
,
"
returned
Edith
,
turning
on
her
with
a
slight
contraction
of
her
brow
.
<EOS>
"
You
and
Mr
Dombey
can
arrange
between
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
true
indeed
,
my
love
,
and
most
considerate
of
you
!
"
said
Cleopatra
.
<EOS>
"
My
darling
Florence
,
you
must
really
come
and
kiss
me
once
more
,
if
you
please
,
my
dear
!
"
  
<EOS>
Singular
coincidence
,
that
these
gushes
of
interest
in
Florence
hurried
Cleopatra
away
from
almost
every
dialogue
in
which
Edith
had
a
share
,
however
trifling
!
<EOS>
Florence
had
certainly
never
undergone
so
much
embracing
,
and
perhaps
had
never
been
,
unconsciously
,
so
useful
in
her
life
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
was
far
from
quarrelling
,
in
his
own
breast
,
with
the
manner
of
his
beautiful
betrothed
.
<EOS>
He
had
that
good
reason
for
sympathy
with
haughtiness
and
coldness
,
which
is
found
in
a
fellow
-
feeling
.
<EOS>
It
flattered
him
to
think
how
these
deferred
to
him
,
in
Edith
's
case
,
and
seemed
to
have
no
will
apart
from
his
.
<EOS>
It
flattered
him
to
picture
to
himself
,
this
proud
and
stately
woman
doing
the
honours
of
his
house
,
and
chilling
his
guests
after
his
own
manner
.
<EOS>
The
dignity
of
Dombey
and
Son
would
be
heightened
and
maintained
,
indeed
,
in
such
hands
.
  
<EOS>
So
thought
Mr
Dombey
,
when
he
was
left
alone
at
the
dining
-
table
,
and
mused
upon
his
past
and
future
fortunes
:
finding
no
uncongeniality
in
an
air
of
scant
and
gloomy
state
that
pervaded
the
room
,
in
colour
a
dark
brown
,
with
black
hatchments
of
pictures
blotching
the
walls
,
and
twenty
-
four
black
chairs
,
with
almost
as
many
nails
in
them
as
so
many
coffins
,
waiting
like
mutes
,
upon
the
threshold
of
the
Turkey
carpet
;
and
two
exhausted
negroes
holding
up
two
withered
branches
of
candelabra
on
the
sideboard
,
and
a
musty
smell
prevailing
as
if
the
ashes
of
ten
thousand
dinners
were
entombed
in
the
sarcophagus
below
it
.
<EOS>
The
owner
of
the
house
lived
much
abroad
;
the
air
of
England
seldom
agreed
long
with
a
member
of
the
Feenix
family
;
and
the
room
had
gradually
put
itself
into
deeper
and
still
deeper
mourning
for
him
,
until
it
was
become
so
funereal
as
to
want
nothing
but
a
body
in
it
to
be
quite
complete
.
  
<EOS>
No
bad
representation
of
the
body
,
for
the
nonce
,
in
his
unbending
form
,
if
not
in
his
attitude
,
Mr
Dombey
looked
down
into
the
cold
depths
of
the
dead
sea
of
mahogany
on
which
the
fruit
dishes
and
decanters
lay
at
anchor
:
as
if
the
subjects
of
his
thoughts
were
rising
towards
the
surface
one
by
one
,
and
plunging
down
again
.
<EOS>
Edith
was
there
in
all
her
majesty
of
brow
and
figure
;
and
close
to
her
came
Florence
,
with
her
timid
head
turned
to
him
,
as
it
had
been
,
for
an
instant
,
when
she
left
the
room
;
and
Edith
's
eyes
upon
her
,
and
Edith
's
hand
put
out
protectingly
.
<EOS>
A
little
figure
in
a
low
arm
-
chair
came
springing
next
into
the
light
,
and
looked
upon
him
wonderingly
,
with
its
bright
eyes
and
its
old
-
young
face
,
gleaming
as
in
the
flickering
of
an
evening
fire
.
<EOS>
Again
came
Florence
close
upon
it
,
and
absorbed
his
whole
attention
.
<EOS>
Whether
as
a
fore
-
doomed
difficulty
and
disappointment
to
him
;
whether
as
a
rival
who
had
crossed
him
in
his
way
,
and
might
again
;
whether
as
his
child
,
of
whom
,
in
his
successful
wooing
,
he
could
stoop
to
think
,
as
claiming
,
at
such
a
time
,
to
be
no
more
estranged
;
or
whether
as
a
hint
to
him
that
the
mere
appearance
of
caring
for
his
own
blood
should
be
maintained
in
his
new
relations
;
he
best
knew
.
<EOS>
Indifferently
well
,
perhaps
,
at
best
;
for
marriage
company
and
marriage
altars
,
and
ambitious
scenes
---
still
blotted
here
and
there
with
Florence
---
always
Florence
---
turned
up
so
fast
,
and
so
confusedly
,
that
he
rose
,
and
went
up
stairs
,
to
escape
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
quite
late
at
night
before
candles
were
brought
;
for
at
present
they
made
Mrs
Skewton
's
head
ache
,
she
complained
;
and
in
the
meantime
Florence
and
Mrs
Skewton
talked
together
(
Cleopatra
being
very
anxious
to
keep
her
close
to
herself
)
,
or
Florence
touched
the
piano
softly
for
Mrs
Skewton
's
delight
;
to
make
no
mention
of
a
few
occasions
in
the
course
of
the
evening
,
when
that
affectionate
lady
was
impelled
to
solicit
another
kiss
,
and
which
always
happened
after
Edith
had
said
anything
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
many
,
however
,
for
Edith
sat
apart
by
an
open
window
during
the
whole
time
(
in
spite
of
her
mother
's
fears
that
she
would
take
cold
)
,
and
remained
there
until
Mr
Dombey
took
leave
.
<EOS>
He
was
serenely
gracious
to
Florence
when
he
did
so
;
and
Florence
went
to
bed
in
a
room
within
Edith
's
,
so
happy
and
hopeful
,
that
she
thought
of
her
late
self
as
if
it
were
some
other
poor
deserted
girl
who
was
to
be
pitied
for
her
sorrow
;
and
in
her
pity
,
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
The
week
fled
fast
.
<EOS>
There
were
drives
to
milliners
,
dress
-
makers
,
jewellers
,
lawyers
,
florists
,
pastry
-
cooks
;
and
Florence
was
always
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
Florence
was
to
go
to
the
wedding
.
<EOS>
Florence
was
to
cast
off
her
mourning
,
and
to
wear
a
brilliant
dress
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
The
milliner
's
intentions
on
the
subject
of
this
dress
<EOS>
---
the
milliner
was
a
Frenchwoman
,
and
greatly
resembled
Mrs
Skewton
---
were
so
chaste
and
elegant
,
that
Mrs
Skewton
bespoke
one
like
it
for
herself
.
<EOS>
The
milliner
said
it
would
become
her
to
admiration
,
and
that
all
the
world
would
take
her
for
the
young
lady
's
sister
.
  
<EOS>
The
week
fled
faster
.
<EOS>
Edith
looked
at
nothing
and
cared
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
Her
rich
dresses
came
home
,
and
were
tried
on
,
and
were
loudly
commended
by
Mrs
Skewton
and
the
milliners
,
and
were
put
away
without
a
word
from
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
made
their
plans
for
every
day
,
and
executed
them
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
Edith
sat
in
the
carriage
when
they
went
to
make
purchases
;
sometimes
,
when
it
was
absolutely
necessary
,
she
went
into
the
shops
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Skewton
conducted
the
whole
business
,
whatever
it
happened
to
be
:
and
Edith
looked
on
as
uninterested
and
with
as
much
apparent
indifference
as
if
she
had
no
concern
in
it
.
<EOS>
Florence
might
perhaps
have
thought
she
was
haughty
and
listless
,
but
that
she
was
never
so
to
her
.
<EOS>
So
Florence
quenched
her
wonder
in
her
gratitude
whenever
it
broke
out
,
and
soon
subdued
it
.
   
<EOS>
The
week
fled
faster
.
<EOS>
It
had
nearly
winged
its
flight
away
.
<EOS>
The
last
night
of
the
week
,
the
night
before
the
marriage
was
come
.
<EOS>
In
the
dark
room
---
for
Mrs
Skewton
's
head
was
no
better
yet
,
though
she
expected
to
recover
permanently
to
-
morrow
---
were
that
lady
,
Edith
,
and
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
Edith
was
at
her
open
window
looking
out
into
the
street
;
Mr
Dombey
and
Cleopatra
were
talking
softly
on
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
It
was
growing
late
;
and
Florence
being
fatigued
,
had
gone
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Dombey
,
"
said
Cleopatra
,
"
you
will
leave
me
Florence
to
-
morrow
,
when
you
deprive
me
of
my
sweetest
Edith
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
said
he
would
,
with
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
have
her
about
me
,
here
,
while
you
are
both
at
Paris
,
and
to
think
that
,
at
her
age
,
I
am
assisting
in
the
formation
of
her
mind
,
my
dear
Dombey
,
"
said
Cleopatra
,
"
will
be
a
perfect
balm
to
me
in
the
extremely
shattered
state
to
which
I
shall
be
reduced
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
turned
her
head
suddenly
.
<EOS>
Her
listless
manner
was
exchanged
,
in
a
moment
,
to
one
of
burning
interest
,
and
,
unseen
in
the
darkness
,
she
attended
closely
to
their
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
would
be
delighted
to
leave
Florence
in
such
admirable
guardianship
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Dombey
,
"
returned
Cleopatra
,
"
a
thousand
thanks
for
your
good
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
feared
you
were
going
,
with
malice
aforethought
,
as
the
dreadful
lawyers
say
---
those
horrid
proses
!
<EOS>
---
to
condemn
me
to
utter
solitude
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
me
so
great
an
injustice
,
my
dear
madam
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
my
charming
Florence
tells
me
so
positively
she
must
go
home
to
-
morrow
,
"
returned
Cleopatra
,
"
that
I
began
to
be
afraid
,
my
dearest
Dombey
,
you
were
quite
a
Bashaw
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
madam
!
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
I
have
laid
no
commands
on
Florence
;
and
if
I
had
,
there
are
no
commands
like
your
wish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Dombey
,
"
replied
Cleopatra
,
"
what
a
courtier
you
are
!
<EOS>
Though
I
'll
not
say
so
,
either
;
for
courtiers
have
no
heart
,
and
yours
pervades
your
charming
life
and
character
.
<EOS>
And
are
you
really
going
so
early
,
my
dear
Dombey
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
it
was
late
,
and
Mr
Dombey
feared
he
must
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
this
a
fact
,
or
is
it
all
a
dream
!
"
lisped
Cleopatra
.
"
<EOS>
Can
I
believe
,
my
dearest
Dombey
,
that
you
are
coming
back
to
-
morrow
morning
to
deprive
me
of
my
sweet
companion
;
my
own
Edith
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
who
was
accustomed
to
take
things
literally
,
reminded
Mrs
Skewton
that
they
were
to
meet
first
at
the
church
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
pang
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
of
consigning
a
child
,
even
to
you
,
my
dear
Dombey
,
is
one
of
the
most
excruciating
imaginable
;
and
combined
with
a
naturally
delicate
constitution
,
and
the
extreme
stupidity
of
the
pastry
-
cook
who
has
undertaken
the
breakfast
,
is
almost
too
much
for
my
poor
strength
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
rally
,
my
dear
Dombey
,
in
the
morning
;
do
not
fear
for
me
,
or
be
uneasy
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
Heaven
bless
you
!
<EOS>
My
dearest
Edith
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
archly
.
<EOS>
"
Somebody
is
going
,
pet
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
,
who
had
turned
her
head
again
towards
the
window
,
and
whose
interest
in
their
conversation
had
ceased
,
rose
up
in
her
place
,
but
made
no
advance
towards
him
,
and
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
with
a
lofty
gallantry
adapted
to
his
dignity
and
the
occasion
,
betook
his
creaking
boots
towards
her
,
put
her
hand
to
his
lips
,
said
,
"
To
-
morrow
morning
<EOS>
I
shall
have
the
happiness
of
claiming
this
hand
as
Mrs
Dombey
's
,
"
and
bowed
himself
solemnly
out
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
rang
for
candles
as
soon
as
the
house
-
door
had
closed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
With
the
candles
appeared
her
maid
,
with
the
juvenile
dress
that
was
to
delude
the
world
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
The
dress
had
savage
retribution
in
it
,
as
such
dresses
ever
have
,
and
made
her
infinitely
older
and
more
hideous
than
her
greasy
flannel
gown
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Skewton
tried
it
on
with
mincing
satisfaction
;
smirked
at
her
cadaverous
self
in
the
glass
,
as
she
thought
of
its
killing
effect
upon
the
Major
;
and
suffering
her
maid
to
take
it
off
again
,
and
to
prepare
her
for
repose
,
tumbled
into
ruins
like
a
house
of
painted
cards
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
Edith
remained
at
the
dark
window
looking
out
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
When
she
and
her
mother
were
at
last
left
alone
,
she
moved
from
it
for
the
first
time
that
evening
,
and
came
opposite
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
yawning
,
shaking
,
peevish
figure
of
the
mother
,
with
her
eyes
raised
to
confront
the
proud
erect
form
of
the
daughter
,
whose
glance
of
fire
was
bent
downward
upon
her
,
had
a
conscious
air
upon
it
,
that
no
levity
or
temper
could
conceal
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
tired
to
death
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
be
trusted
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
You
are
worse
than
a
child
.
<EOS>
Child
!
<EOS>
No
child
would
be
half
so
obstinate
and
undutiful
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
me
,
mother
,
"
returned
Edith
,
passing
these
words
by
with
a
scorn
that
would
not
descend
to
trifle
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
remain
alone
here
,
until
I
return
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Must
remain
alone
here
,
Edith
,
until
you
return
!
"
repeated
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Or
in
that
name
upon
which
I
shall
call
to
-
morrow
to
witness
what
I
do
,
so
falsely
,
and
so
shamefully
,
I
swear
I
will
refuse
the
hand
of
this
man
in
the
church
.
<EOS>
If
I
do
not
,
may
I
fall
dead
upon
the
pavement
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
mother
answered
with
a
look
of
quick
alarm
,
in
no
degree
diminished
by
the
look
she
met
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
enough
,
"
said
Edith
,
steadily
,
"
that
we
are
what
we
are
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
no
youth
and
truth
dragged
down
to
my
level
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
no
guileless
nature
undermined
,
corrupted
,
and
perverted
,
to
amuse
the
leisure
of
a
world
of
mothers
.
<EOS>
You
know
my
meaning
.
<EOS>
Florence
must
go
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
an
idiot
,
Edith
,
"
cried
her
angry
mother
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
expect
there
can
ever
be
peace
for
you
in
that
house
,
till
she
is
married
,
and
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
me
,
or
ask
yourself
,
if
I
ever
expect
peace
in
that
house
,
"
said
her
daughter
,
"
and
you
know
the
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
am
I
to
be
told
to
-
night
,
after
all
my
pains
and
labour
,
and
when
you
are
going
,
through
me
,
to
be
rendered
independent
,
"
her
mother
almost
shrieked
in
her
passion
,
while
her
palsied
head
shook
like
a
leaf
,
"
that
there
is
corruption
and
contagion
in
me
,
and
that
I
am
not
fit
company
for
a
girl!What
<EOS>
are
you
,
pray
?
<EOS>
What
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
put
the
question
to
myself
,
"
said
Edith
,
ashy
pale
,
and
pointing
to
the
window
,
"
more
than
once
when
I
have
been
sitting
there
,
and
something
in
the
faded
likeness
of
my
sex
has
wandered
past
outside
;
and
God
knows
I
have
met
with
my
reply
.
<EOS>
Oh
mother
,
mother
,
if
you
had
but
left
me
to
my
natural
heart
when
I
too
was
a
girl
---
a
younger
girl
than
Florence
---
how
different
I
might
have
been
!
"
  
<EOS>
Sensible
that
any
show
of
anger
was
useless
here
,
her
mother
restrained
herself
,
and
fell
a
whimpering
,
and
bewailed
that
she
had
lived
too
long
,
and
that
her
only
child
had
cast
her
off
,
and
that
duty
towards
parents
was
forgotten
in
these
evil
days
,
and
that
she
had
heard
unnatural
taunts
,
and
cared
for
life
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
one
is
to
go
on
living
through
continual
scenes
like
this
,
"
she
whined
,
"
I
am
sure
it
would
be
much
better
for
me
to
think
of
some
means
of
putting
an
end
to
my
existence
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
The
idea
of
your
being
my
daughter
,
Edith
,
and
addressing
me
in
such
a
strain
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Between
us
,
mother
,
"
returned
Edith
,
mournfully
,
"
the
time
for
mutual
reproaches
is
past
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
do
you
revive
it
?
<EOS>
"
whimpered
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
you
are
lacerating
me
in
the
cruellest
manner
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
sensitive
I
am
to
unkindness
.
<EOS>
At
such
a
moment
,
too
,
when
I
have
so
much
to
think
of
,
and
am
naturally
anxious
to
appear
to
the
best
advantage
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
at
you
,
Edith
.
<EOS>
To
make
your
mother
a
fright
upon
your
wedding
-
day
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
bent
the
same
fixed
look
upon
her
,
as
she
sobbed
and
rubbed
her
eyes
;
and
said
in
the
same
low
steady
voice
,
which
had
neither
risen
nor
fallen
since
she
first
addressed
her
,
"
I
have
said
that
Florence
must
go
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
her
go
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
afflicted
and
affrighted
parent
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
am
willing
she
should
go
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
girl
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
so
much
to
me
,
that
rather
than
communicate
,
or
suffer
to
be
communicated
to
her
,
one
grain
of
the
evil
that
is
in
my
breast
,
mother
,
I
would
renounce
you
,
as
I
would
(
if
you
gave
me
cause
)
<EOS>
renounce
him
in
the
church
to
-
morrow
,
"
replied
Edith
.
"
<EOS>
Leave
her
alone
.
<EOS>
She
shall
not
,
while
I
can
interpose
,
be
tampered
with
and
tainted
by
the
lessons
I
have
learned
.
<EOS>
This
is
no
hard
condition
on
this
bitter
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
proposed
it
in
a
filial
manner
,
Edith
,
"
whined
her
mother
,
"
perhaps
not
;
very
likely
not
.
<EOS>
But
such
extremely
cutting
words
---
"
  
"
They
are
past
and
at
an
end
between
us
now
,
"
said
Edith
.
<EOS>
"
Take
your
own
way
,
mother
;
share
as
you
please
in
what
you
have
gained
;
spend
,
enjoy
,
make
much
of
it
;
and
be
as
happy
as
you
will
.
<EOS>
The
object
of
our
lives
is
won
.
<EOS>
Henceforth
let
us
wear
it
silently
.
<EOS>
My
lips
are
closed
upon
the
past
from
this
hour
.
<EOS>
I
forgive
you
your
part
in
to
-
morrow
's
wickedness
.
<EOS>
May
God
forgive
my
own
!
"
  
<EOS>
Without
a
tremor
in
her
voice
,
or
frame
,
and
passing
onward
with
a
foot
that
set
itself
upon
the
neck
of
every
soft
emotion
,
she
bade
her
mother
good
night
,
and
repaired
to
her
own
room
.
  
<EOS>
But
not
to
rest
;
for
there
was
no
rest
in
the
tumult
of
her
agitation
when
alone
.
<EOS>
To
and
fro
,
and
to
and
fro
,
and
to
and
fro
again
,
five
hundred
times
,
among
the
splendid
preparations
for
her
adornment
on
the
morrow
;
with
her
dark
hair
shaken
down
,
her
dark
eyes
flashing
with
a
raging
light
,
her
broad
white
bosom
red
with
the
cruel
grasp
of
the
relentless
hand
with
which
she
spurned
it
from
her
,
pacing
up
and
down
with
an
averted
head
,
as
if
she
would
avoid
the
sight
of
her
own
fair
person
,
and
divorce
herself
from
its
companionship
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
in
the
dead
time
of
the
night
before
her
bridal
,
Edith
Granger
wrestled
with
her
unquiet
spirit
,
tearless
,
friendless
,
silent
,
proud
,
and
uncomplaining
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
it
happened
that
she
touched
the
open
door
which
led
into
the
room
where
Florence
lay
.
  
<EOS>
She
started
,
stopped
,
and
looked
in
.
  
<EOS>
A
light
was
burning
there
,
and
showed
her
Florence
in
her
bloom
of
innocence
and
beauty
,
fast
asleep
.
<EOS>
Edith
held
her
breath
,
and
felt
herself
drawn
on
towards
her
.
  
<EOS>
Drawn
nearer
,
nearer
,
nearer
yet
;
at
last
,
drawn
so
near
,
that
stooping
down
,
she
pressed
her
lips
to
the
gentle
hand
that
lay
outside
the
bed
,
and
put
it
softly
to
her
neck
.
<EOS>
Its
touch
was
like
the
prophet
's
rod
of
old
upon
the
rock
.
<EOS>
Her
tears
sprung
forth
beneath
it
,
as
she
sunk
upon
her
knees
,
and
laid
her
aching
head
and
streaming
hair
upon
the
pillow
by
its
side
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
Edith
Granger
passed
the
night
before
her
bridal
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
sun
found
her
on
her
bridal
morning
.

Chapter

<EOS>
The
Wedding
 
DAWN
,
with
its
passionless
blank
face
,
steals
shivering
to
the
church
beneath
which
lies
the
dust
of
little
Paul
and
his
mother
,
and
looks
in
at
the
windows
.
<EOS>
It
is
cold
and
dark
.
<EOS>
Night
crouches
yet
,
upon
the
pavement
,
and
broods
,
sombre
and
heavy
,
in
nooks
and
corners
of
the
building
.
<EOS>
The
steeple
-
clock
,
perched
up
above
the
houses
,
emerging
from
beneath
another
of
the
countless
ripples
in
the
tide
of
time
that
regularly
roll
and
break
on
the
eternal
shore
,
is
greyly
visible
,
like
a
stone
beacon
,
recording
how
the
sea
flows
on
;
but
within
doors
,
dawn
,
at
first
,
can
only
peep
at
night
,
and
see
that
it
is
there
.
  
<EOS>
Hovering
feebly
round
the
church
,
and
looking
in
,
dawn
moans
and
weeps
for
its
short
reign
,
and
its
tears
trickle
on
the
window
-
glass
,
and
the
trees
against
the
church
-
wall
bow
their
heads
,
and
wring
their
many
hands
in
sympathy
.
<EOS>
Night
,
growing
pale
before
it
,
gradually
fades
out
of
the
church
,
but
lingers
in
the
vaults
below
,
and
sits
upon
the
coffins
.
<EOS>
And
now
comes
bright
day
,
burnishing
the
steeple
-
clock
,
and
reddening
the
spire
,
and
drying
up
the
tears
of
dawn
,
and
stifling
its
complaining
;
and
the
scared
dawn
,
following
the
night
,
and
chasing
it
from
its
last
refuge
,
shrinks
into
the
vaults
itself
and
hides
,
with
a
frightened
face
,
among
the
dead
,
until
night
returns
,
refreshed
,
to
drive
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
the
mice
,
who
have
been
busier
with
the
prayer
-
books
than
their
proper
owners
,
and
with
the
hassocks
,
more
worn
by
their
little
teeth
by
human
knees
,
hide
their
bright
eyes
in
their
holes
,
and
gather
close
together
in
affright
at
the
resounding
clashing
of
the
church
-
door
.
<EOS>
For
the
beadle
,
that
man
of
power
,
comes
early
this
morning
with
the
sexton
;
and
Mrs
Miff
,
the
wheezy
little
pew
-
opener
---
a
mighty
dry
old
lady
,
sparely
dressed
,
with
not
an
inch
of
fulness
anywhere
about
her
---
is
also
here
,
and
has
been
waiting
at
the
church
-
gate
half
-
an
-
hour
,
as
her
place
is
,
for
the
beadle
.
  
<EOS>
A
vinegary
face
has
Mrs
Miff
,
and
a
mortified
bonnet
,
and
eke
a
thirsty
soul
for
sixpences
and
shillings
.
<EOS>
Beckoning
to
stray
people
to
come
into
pews
,
has
given
Mrs
Miff
an
air
of
mystery
;
and
there
is
reservation
in
the
eye
of
Mrs
Miff
,
as
always
knowing
of
a
softer
seat
,
but
having
her
suspicions
of
the
fee
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
such
fact
as
Mr
Miff
,
nor
has
there
been
,
these
twenty
years
,
and
Mrs
Miff
would
rather
not
allude
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
held
some
bad
opinions
,
it
would
seem
,
about
free
seats
,
and
though
Mrs
Miff
hopes
he
may
be
gone
upwards
,
she
could
n't
positively
undertake
to
say
so
.
  
<EOS>
Busy
is
Mrs
Miff
this
morning
at
the
church
-
door
,
beating
and
dusting
the
altar
-
cloth
,
the
carpet
,
and
the
cushions
;
and
much
has
Mrs
Miff
to
say
,
about
the
wedding
they
are
going
to
have
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Miff
is
told
,
that
the
new
furniture
and
alterations
in
the
house
cost
full
five
thousand
pound
if
they
cost
a
penny
;
and
Mrs
Miff
has
heard
,
upon
the
best
authority
,
that
the
lady
has
n't
got
a
sixpence
wherewithal
to
bless
herself
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Miff
remembers
,
likewise
,
as
if
it
had
happened
yesterday
,
the
first
wife
's
funeral
,
and
then
the
christening
,
and
then
the
other
funeral
;
and
Mrs
Miff
says
,
by
-
the
-
bye
<EOS>
she
'll
soap
-
and
-
water
that
'
ere
tablet
presently
,
against
the
company
<EOS>
arrive
.
<EOS>
Mr
Sownds
,
the
Beadle
,
who
is
sitting
in
the
sun
upon
the
church
steps
all
this
time
(
and
seldom
does
anything
else
,
except
,
in
cold
weather
,
sitting
by
the
fire
)
,
approves
of
Mrs
Miff
's
discourse
,
and
asks
if
Mrs
Miff
has
heard
it
said
,
that
the
lady
is
uncommon
handsome
?
<EOS>
The
information
Mrs
Miff
has
received
,
being
of
this
nature
,
Mr
Sownds
the
Beadle
,
who
,
though
orthodox
and
corpulent
,
is
still
an
admirer
of
female
beauty
,
observes
,
with
unction
,
<EOS>
yes
,
he
hears
she
is
a
spanker
---
an
expression
that
seems
somewhat
forcible
to
Mrs
Miff
,
or
would
,
from
any
lips
but
those
of
Mr
Sownds
the
Beadle
.
  
<EOS>
In
Mr
Dombey
's
house
,
at
this
same
time
,
there
is
great
stir
and
bustle
,
more
especially
among
the
women
:
not
one
of
whom
has
had
a
wink
of
sleep
since
four
o'clock
,
and
all
of
whom
were
fully
dressed
before
six
.
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
is
an
object
of
greater
consideration
than
usual
to
the
housemaid
,
and
the
cook
says
at
breakfast
-
time
that
one
wedding
makes
many
,
which
the
housemaid
ca
n't
believe
,
and
do
n't
think
true
at
all
.
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
reserves
his
sentiments
on
this
question
;
being
rendered
something
gloomy
by
the
engagement
of
a
foreigner
with
whiskers
(
Mr
Towlinson
is
whiskerless
himself
)
,
who
has
been
hired
to
accompany
the
happy
pair
to
Paris
,
and
who
is
busy
packing
the
new
chariot
.
<EOS>
In
respect
of
this
personage
,
Mr
Towlinson
admits
,
presently
,
that
he
never
knew
of
any
good
that
ever
come
of
foreigners
;
and
being
charged
by
the
ladies
with
prejudice
,
says
,
look
at
Bonaparte
who
was
at
the
head
of
'em
,
and
see
what
he
was
always
up
<EOS>
to!Which
<EOS>
the
housemaid
says
is
very
true
.
  
<EOS>
The
pastry
-
cook
is
hard
at
work
in
the
funeral
room
in
Brook
Street
,
and
the
very
tall
young
men
are
busy
looking
on
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
very
tall
young
men
already
smells
of
sherry
,
and
his
eyes
have
a
tendency
to
become
fixed
in
his
head
,
and
to
stare
at
objects
without
seeing
them
.
<EOS>
The
very
tall
young
man
is
conscious
of
this
failing
in
himself
;
and
informs
his
comrade
that
it
's
his
"
exciseman
.
<EOS>
"
The
very
tall
young
man
would
say
excitement
,
but
his
speech
is
hazy
.
  
<EOS>
The
men
who
play
the
bells
have
got
scent
of
the
marriage
;
and

In

attires
himself

behold
the

splendour
from

secret
corner

thither
to
convey
the
Chicken

Mr

desperate
intent

Now

<EOS>
The

much

astonished
Chicken

in

dips
his

into
a

Besides

Truly

Mr

Truly
,
Mrs

has
cause
to
pounce
on
an
unlucky
dwarf
child
,
with
a
giant
baby
,
who
peeps
in
at
the
porch

drive
her
forth
with
indignation

<EOS>
Cousin
Feenix
has
come
over
from
abroad
,
expressly
to
attend
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
Cousin
Feenix
was
a
man
about
town
,
forty
years
ago
;
but
he
is
still
so
juvenile
in
figure
and
in
manner
,
and
so
well
got
up
,
that
strangers
are
amazed
when
they
discover
latent
wrinkles
in
his
lordship
's
face
,
and
crows
'
feet
in
his
eyes
;
and
first
observe
him
,
not
exactly
certain
when
he
walks
across
a
room
,
of
going
quite
straight
to
where
he
wants
to
go
.
<EOS>
But
Cousin
Feenix
,
getting
up
at
half
-
past
seven
o'clock
or
so
,
is
quite
another
thing
from
Cousin
Feenix
got
up
;
and
very
dim
,
indeed
,
he
looks
,
while
being
shaved
at
Long

Hotel

in
Bond

<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
leaves
his
dressing

room
,
amidst
a
general
whisking
away
of
the
women
on
the
staircase
,
who
disperse
in
all
directions
,
with
a
great
rustling
of
skirts
,
except
Mrs
Perch
,
who
,
being
(
but
that
she
always
is
)
in
an
interesting
situation
,
is
not
nimble
,
and
is
obliged
to
face
him
,
and
is
ready
to
sink
with
confusion
as
she
curtseys
;

may
Heaven
avert
all
evil
consequences
from
the
house
of
Perch

<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
walks
up
to
the

to

his

<EOS>
Gorgeous
are
Mr

's
new
blue

fawn

lilac
waistcoat

a
whisper
goes
about
the

that
Mr

hair
is
curled
.
  
<EOS>
A
double
knock
announces
the
arrival
of
the
Major
,
who
is
orgeous
too
,
and
wears
a
whole
geranium
in
his
button

has
his
hair
curled
tight

crisp
,
<EOS>
as

in

<EOS>
Sir

has
half
a
mind
to
make
a
double
marriage
of
it
,
Sir
,
and
take
the
mother
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
smiles
;
but
faintly
,
even
for
him
;
for
Mr
Dombey
feels
that
he
is
going
to
be
related
to
the
mother
,
and
that
,
under
those
circumstances
,
she
is
not
to
be
joked
about
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dombey
,
"
says
the
Major
,
seeing
this

"
I

I

"
you

,
than
any
man

England

"
  
<EOS>
Here
again
Mr
Dombey
's
assent
is
qualified
;
because
he
is
going
to
confer
a
great
distinction
on
a
lady

,
no

,
she
is
to
be
envied
most

"
As

speaking
out

I
tell

at

a

must
blurt
out
what
he
feels

put
a
muzzle
on

Joseph
Bagstock
tells
you
to
your
face

Dombey

he
tells

concludes

great

"
  
<EOS>
"

says
Mr

Not

<EOS>
"
Dombey

says
the

with
appropriate

That

did
me
the
honour

observe

Sir

to
His
Royal
Highness

Duke

<EOS>
Now
enters
Mr
Carker

gorgeous
likewise

and
smiling
like
a
wedding

guest
indeed
.
<EOS>
He
can
scarcely
let
Mr
Dombey
's
hand
go
,
he
is
so
congratulatory
;
and
he
shakes
the
Major
's
hand
so
heartily
at
the
same
time

that
his
voice
shakes
too

in
accord
with
his

it
comes
sliding
from

"
I

says
Mr
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
afraid
I
might
be
a
few
seconds
after
the
appointed
time

I

delayed

procession

waggons

I
took

riding
round

Brook
Street

---
this
to
Mr
Dombey

"
to
leave
a

poor
rarities

flowers
for
Mrs

<EOS>
A

so
distinguished

be
invited
here

is
proud
to
offer
some
homage
in
acknowledgment

his
vassalage

and
as
I
have
no

Mrs
Dombey
is
overwhelmed
with
what
is
costly

magnificent

with
a
strange
glance
at
his
patron

I

find
favour

condescending

And
if

says
the
Major

putting
down
his
coffee

cup

looking
at

watch

"
it

<EOS>
Forth
,
in
a
barouche

ride
Mr
Dombey

Major
Bagstock
,
and
Mr
Carker
,
to
the
church

<EOS>
Mr
Sownds
the
Beadle
has
long
risen
from
the
steps
,
and
is
in
waiting
with
his
cocked
hat
in
his
hand

<EOS>
Mrs
Miff
curtseys
and
proposes
chairs
in
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
prefers
remaining
in
the
church
.
<EOS>
As
he
looks
up
at
the
organ
,
Miss
Tox
in
the
gallery
shrinks
behind
the
fat
leg
of
a
cherub
on
a
monument
,
with
cheeks
like
a
young
Wind
.
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
on
the
contrary
,
stands
up
and
waves
his
hook
,
in
token
of
welcome
and
encouragement
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
informs
the
Chicken
,
behind
his
hand
,
that
the
middle
gentleman
,
he
in
the
fawn
-
coloured
pantaloons
,
is
the
father
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
The
Chicken
hoarsely
whispers
Mr
Toots
that
he
's
as
stiff
a
cove
as
ever
he
see
,
but
that
it
is
within
the
resources
of
Science
to
double
him
up
,
with
one
blow
in
the
waistcoat
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Sownds
and
Mrs
Miff
are
eyeing
Mr
Dombey
from
a
little
distance
,
when
the
noise
of
approaching
wheels
is
heard
,
and
Mr
Sownds
goes
out
;
Mrs
Miff
,
meeting
Mr
Dombey
's
eye
as
it
is
withdrawn
from
the
presumptuous
maniac
up
stairs
,
who
salutes
him
with
so
much
urbanity
,
drops
a
curtsey
,
and
informs
him
that
she
believes
his
"
good
lady
"
is
come
.
<EOS>
Then
there
is
a
crowding
and
a
whispering
at
the
door
,
and
the
good
lady
enters
,
with
a
haughty
step
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
no
sign
upon
her
face
,
of
last
night
's
suffering
;
there
is
no
trace
in
her
manner
,
of
the
woman
on
the
bended
knees
reposing
her
wild
head
,
in
beautiful
abandonment
,
upon
the
pillow
of
the
sleeping
girl
.
<EOS>
That
girl
,
all
gentle
and
lovely
,
is
at
her
side
---
a
striking
contrast
to
her
own
disdainful
and
defiant
figure
,
standing
there
,
composed
,
erect
,
inscrutable
of
will
,
resplendent
and
majestic
in
the
zenith
of
its
charms
,
yet
beating
down
,
and
treading
on
,
the
admiration
that
it
challenges
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
pause
while
Mr
Sownds
the
Beadle
glides
into
the
vestry
for
the
clergyman
and
clerk
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
Mrs
Skewton
speaks
to
Mr
Dombey
:
more
distinctly
and
emphatically
than
her
custom
is
,
and
moving
at
the
same
time
,
close
to

"
My
dear
Dombey
,
"
said
the
good
Mama
,
"
<EOS>
I
fear
I
must
relinquish
darling
Florence
after
all
,
and
suffer
her
to
go
home
,
as
she
herself
proposed
.
<EOS>
After
my
loss
of
to
-
day
,
my
dear
Dombey
,
I
feel
I
shall
not
have
spirits
,
even
for
her
society
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Had
she
not
better
stay
with
you
?
"
returns
the
Bridegroom
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
my
dear
Dombey
.
<EOS>
No
,
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
better
alone
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
my
dearest
Edith
will
be
her
natural
and
constant
guardian
when
you
return
,
and
I
had
better
not
encroach
upon
her
trust
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
She
might
be
jealous
.
<EOS>
Eh
,
dear
Edith
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
affectionate
Mama
Presses
her
daughter
's
arm
,
as
she
says
this
;
perhaps
entreating
her
attention
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
serious
,
my
dear
Dombey
,
"
she
resumes
,
"
I
will
relinquish
our
dear
child
,
and
not
inflict
my
gloom
upon
her
.
<EOS>
We
have
settled
that
,
just
now
.
<EOS>
She
fully
understands
,
dear
Dombey
.
<EOS>
Edith
,
my
dear
,
---
she
fully
understands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Again
,
the
good
mother
presses
her
daughter
's
arm
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
offers
no
additional
remonstrance
;
for
the
clergyman
and
clerk
appear
;
and
Mrs
Miff
,
and
Mr
Sownds
the
Beadle
,
group
the
party
in
their
proper
places
at
the
altar
rails
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Who
giveth
this
woman
to
be
married
to
this
man
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
Cousin
Feenix
does
that
.
<EOS>
He
has
come
from
Baden
-
Baden
or
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Confound
it
,
"
Cousin
Feenix
says
---
good
-
natured
creature
,
Cousin
Feenix
---
"
when
we
do
get
a
rich
City
fellow
into
the
family
,
let
us
show
him
some
attention
;
let
us
do
something
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
give
this
woman
to
be
married
to
this
man
,
"
saith
Cousin
Feenix
therefore
.
<EOS>
Cousin
Feenix
,
meaning
to
go
in
a
straight
line
,
but
turning
off
sideways
by
reason
of
his
wilful
legs
,
gives
the
wrong
woman
to
be
married
to
this
man
,
at
first
---
to
wit
,
a
bridesmaid
of
some
condition
,
distantly
connected
with
the
family
,
and
ten
years
Mrs
Skewton
's
junior
---
but
Mrs
Miff
,
interposing
her
mortified
bonnet
,
dexterously
turns
him
back
,
and
runs
him
,
as
on
castors
,
full
at
the
"
good
lady
:
"
whom
Cousin
Feenix
giveth
to
be
married
to
this
man
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
And
will
they
in
the
sight
of
heaven
---
?
   
<EOS>
Aye
,
that
they
will
:
Mr
Dombey
says
he
will
.
<EOS>
And
what
says
Edith
?
<EOS>
She
will
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
from
that
day
forward
,
for
better
for
worse
,
for
richer
for
poorer
,
in
sickness
and
in
health
,
to
love
and
to
cherish
,
till
death
do
them
<EOS>
part
,
they
plight
their
troth
to
one
another
,
and
are
married
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
firm
,
free
hand
,
the
Bride
subscribes
her
name
in
the
register
,
when
they
adjourn
to
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
There
an't
a
many
ladies
come
here
,
"
Mrs
Miff
says
with
a
curtsey
---
to
look
at
Mrs
Miff
,
at
such
a
season
,
is
to
make
her
mortified
bonnet
go
down
with
a
dip
---
"
writes
their
names
like
this
good
lady
!
"
<EOS>
Mr
Sownds
the
Beadle
thinks
it
is
a
truly
spanking
signature
,
and
worthy
of
the
writer
---
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
between
himself
and
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
signs
too
,
but
unapplauded
,
for
her
hand
shakes
.
<EOS>
All
the
party
sign
;
Cousin
Feenix
last
;
who
puts
his
noble
name
into
a
wrong
place
,
and
enrols
himself
as
having
been
born
that
morning
.
  
<EOS>
The
Major
now
salutes
the
Bride
right
gallantly
,
and
carries
out
that
branch
of
military
tactics
in
reference
to
all
the
ladies
:
notwithstanding
Mrs
Skewton
's
being
extremely
hard
to
kiss
,
and
squeaking
shrilly
in
the
sacred
edifice
.
<EOS>
The
example
is
followed
by
Cousin
Feenix
,
and
even
by
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
Lastly
,
Mr
Carker
,
with
his
white
teeth
glistening
,
approaches
Edith
,
more
as
if
he
meant
to
bite
her
,
than
to
taste
the
sweets
that
linger
on
her
lips
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
glow
upon
her
proud
cheek
,
and
a
flashing
in
her
eyes
,
that
may
be
meant
to
stay
him
;
but
it
does
not
,
for
he
salutes
her
as
the
rest
have
done
,
and
wishes
her
all
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
wishes
,
"
says
he
in
a
low
voice
,
"
are
not
superfluous
,
applied
to
such
a
union
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
,
Sir
,
"
she
answers
,
with
a
curled
lip
,
and
a
heaving
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
does
Edith
feel
still
,
as
on
the
night
when
she
knew
that
Mr
Dombey
would
return
to
offer
his
alliance
,
that
Carker
knows
her
thoroughly
,
and
reads
her
right
,
and
that
she
is
more
degraded
by
his
knowledge
of
her
,
than
by
aught
else
?
<EOS>
Is
it
for
this
reason
that
her
haughtiness
shrinks
beneath
his
smile
,
like
snow
within
the
hand
that
grasps
it
firmly
,
and
that
her
imperious
glance
droops
in
meeting
his
,
and
seeks
the
ground
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
proud
to
see
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
with
a
servile
stooping
of
his
neck
,
which
the
revelations
making
by
his
eyes
and
teeth
proclaim
to
be
a
lie
,
"
I
am
proud
to
see
that
my
humble
offering
is
graced
by
Mrs
Dombey
's
hand
,
and
permitted
to
hold
so
favoured
a
place
in
so
joyful
an
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Though
she
bends
her
head
,
in
answer
,
there
is
something
in
the
momentary
action
of
her
hand
,
as
if
she
would
crush
the
flowers
it
holds
,
and
fling
them
,
with
contempt
,
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
But
,
she
puts
the
hand
through
the
arm
of
her
new
husband
,
who
has
been
standing
near
,
conversing
with
the
Major
,
and
is
proud
again
,
and
motionless
,
and
silent
.
  
<EOS>
The
carriages
are
once
more
at
the
church
door
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
with
his
bride
upon
his
arm
,
conducts
her
through
the
twenty
families
of
little
women
who
are
on
the
steps
,
and
every
one
of
whom
remembers
the
fashion
and
the
colour
of
her
every
article
of
dress
from
that
moment
,
and
reproduces
it
on
her
doll
,
who
is
for
ever
being
married
.
<EOS>
Cleopatra
and
Cousin
Feenix
enter
the
same
carriage
.
<EOS>
The
Major
hands
into
a
second
carriage
,
Florence
,
and
the
bridesmaid
who
so
narrowly
escaped
being
given
away
by
mistake
,
and
then
enters
it
himself
,
and
is
followed
by
Mr
Carker
.
<EOS>
Horses
prance
and
caper
;
coachmen
and
footmen
shine
in
fluttering
favours
,
flowers
,
and
new
-
made
liveries
.
<EOS>
Away
they
dash
and
rattle
through
the
streets
:
<EOS>
and
as
they
pass
along
,
a
thousand
heads
are
turned
to
look
at
them
,
and
a
thousand
sober
moralists
revenge
themselves
for
not
being
married
too
,
that
morning
,
by
reflecting
that
these
people
little
think
such
happiness
ca
n't
last
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
emerges
from
behind
the
cherub
's
leg
,
when
all
is
quiet
,
and
comes
slowly
down
from
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
's
eyes
are
red
,
and
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
is
damp
.
<EOS>
She
is
wounded
,
but
not
exasperated
,
and
she
hopes
they
may
be
happy
.
<EOS>
She
quite
admits
to
herself
the
beauty
of
the
bride
,
and
her
own
comparatively
feeble
and
faded
attractions
;
but
the
stately
image
of
Mr
Dombey
in
his
lilac
waistcoat
,
and
his
fawn
-
coloured
pantaloons
,
is
present
to
her
mind
,
and
Miss
Tox
<EOS>
weeps
afresh
,
behind
her
veil
,
on
her
way
home
to
Princess
's
Place
.
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
having
joined
in
all
the
amens
and
responses
,
with
a
devout
growl
,
feels
much
improved
by
his
religious
exercises
;
and
in
a
peaceful
frame
of
mind
,
pervades
the
body
of
the
church
,
glazed
hat
in
hand
,
and
reads
the
tablet
to
the
memory
of
little
Paul
.
<EOS>
The
gallant
Mr
Toots
,
attended
by
the
faithful
Chicken
,
leaves
the
building
in
torments
of
love
.
<EOS>
The
Chicken
is
as
yet
unable
to
elaborate
a
scheme
for
winning
Florence
,
but
his
first
idea
has
gained
possession
of
him
,
and
he
thinks
the
doubling
up
of
Mr
Dombey
would
be
a
move
in
the
right
direction
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
servants
come
out
of
their
hiding
-
places
,
and
prepare
to
rush
to
Brook
Street
,
when
they
are
delayed
by
symptoms
of
indisposition
on
the
part
of
Mrs
Perch
,
who
entreats
a
glass
of
water
,
and
becomes
alarming
;
Mrs
Perch
gets
better
soon
,
however
,
and
is
borne
away
;
and
Mrs
Miff
,
and
Mr
Sownds
the
Beadle
,
sit
upon
the
steps
to
count
what
they
have
gained
by
the
affair
,
and
talk
it
over
,
while
the
sexton
tolls
a
funeral
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
the
carriages
arrive
at
the
Bride
's
residence
,
and
the
players
on
the
bells
begin
to
jingle
,
and
the
band
strikes
up
,
and
Mr
Punch
,
that
model
of
connubial
bliss
,
salutes
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Now
,
the
people
run
and
push
,
and
press
round
in
a
gaping
throng
,
while
Mr
Dombey
,
leading
Mrs
Dombey
by
the
hand
,
advances
solemnly
into
the
Feenix
Halls
.
<EOS>
Now
,
the
rest
of
the
wedding
party
alight
,
and
enter
after
them
.
<EOS>
And
why
does
Mr
Carker
,
passing
through
the
people
to
the
hall
-
door
,
think
of
the
old
woman
who
called
to
him
in
the
Grove
that
morning
?
<EOS>
Or
why
does
Florence
,
as
she
passes
,
think
,
with
a
tremble
,
of
her
childhood
,
when
she
was
lost
,
and
of
the
visage
of
good
Mrs
Brown
?
  
<EOS>
Now
,
there
are
more
congratulations
on
this
happiest
of
days
,
and
more
company
,
though
not
much
;
and
now
they
leave
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
range
themselves
at
table
in
the
dark
-
brown
dining
-
room
,
which
no
confectioner
can
brighten
up
,
let
him
garnish
the
exhausted
negroes
with
as
many
flowers
and
love
-
knots
as
he
will
.
  
<EOS>
The
pastry
-
cook
has
done
his
duty
like
a
man
,
though
,
and
a
rich
breakfast
is
set
forth
.
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Chick
have
joined
the
party
,
among
others
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
admires
that
Edith
should
be
,
by
nature
,
such
a
perfect
Dombey
;
and
is
affable
and
confidential
to
Mrs
Skewton
,
whose
mind
is
relieved
of
a
great
load
,
and
who
takes
her
share
of
the
champagne
.
<EOS>
The
very
tall
young
man
who
suffered
from
excitement
early
,
is
better
;
but
a
vague
sentiment
of
repentance
has
seized
upon
him
,
and
he
hates
the
other
very
tall
young
man
,
and
wrests
dishes
from
him
by
violence
,
and
takes
a
grim
delight
in
disobliging
the
company
.
<EOS>
The
company
are
cool
and
calm
,
and
do
not
outrage
the
black
hatchments
of
pictures
looking
down
upon
them
,
by
any
excess
of
mirth
.
<EOS>
Cousin
Feenix
and
the
Major
are
the
gayest
there
;
but
Mr
Carker
has
a
smile
for
the
whole
table
.
<EOS>
He
has
an
especial
smile
for
the
Bride
,
who
very
,
very
seldom
meets
it
.
  
<EOS>
Cousin
Feenix
rises
,
when
the
company
have
breakfasted
,
and
the
servants
have
left
the
room
;
and
wonderfully
young
he
looks
,
with
his
white
wristbands
almost
covering
his
hands
(
otherwise
rather
bony
)
,
and
the
bloom
of
the
champagne
in
his
cheeks
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
honour
,
"
says
Cousin
Feenix
,
"
although
it
's
an
unusual
sort
of
thing
is
a
private
gentleman
's
house
,
I
must
beg
leave
to
call
upon
you
to
drink
what
is
usually
called
a
---
in
fact
a
toast
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
very
hoarsely
indicates
his
approval
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
,
bending
his
head
forward
over
the
table
in
the
direction
of
Cousin
Feenix
,
smiles
and
nods
a
great
many
times
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
---
in
fact
it
's
not
a
---
"
Cousin
Feenix
beginning
again
,
thus
,
comes
to
a
dead
stop
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hear
,
hear
!
"
says
the
Major
,
in
a
tone
of
conviction
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
softly
claps
his
hands
,
and
bending
forward
over
the
table
again
,
smiles
and
nods
a
great
many
more
times
than
before
,
as
if
he
were
particularly
struck
by
this
last
observation
,
and
desired
personally
to
express
his
sense
of
the
good
it
has
done
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
says
Cousin
Feenix
,
"
an
occasion
in
fact
,
when
the
general
usages
of
life
may
be
a
little
departed
from
,
without
impropriety
;
and
although
I
never
was
an
orator
in
my
life
,
and
when
I
was
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
had
the
honour
of
seconding
the
address
,
was
---
in
fact
,
was
laid
up
for
a
fort
-
night
with
the
consciousness
of
failure
---
"
  
<EOS>
The
Major
and
Mr
Carker
are
so
much
delighted
by
this
fragment
of
personal
history
,
that
Cousin
Feenix
laughs
,
and
addressing
them
individually
,
goes
on
to
say
:
  
"
<EOS>
And
in
point
of
fact
,
when
I
was
devilish
ill
---
still
,
you
know
,
I
feel
that
a
duty
devolves
upon
me
.
<EOS>
And
when
a
duty
devolves
upon
an
Englishman
,
he
is
bound
to
get
out
of
it
,
in
my
opinion
,
in
the
best
way
he
can
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
our
family
has
had
the
gratification
,
to
-
day
,
of
connecting
itself
,
in
the
person
of
my
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
,
whom
I
now
see
---
in
point
of
fact
,
present
---
"
  
<EOS>
Here
there
is
general
applause
.
  
<EOS>
"
Present
,
"
repeats
Cousin
Feenix
,
feeling
that
it
is
a
neat
point
which
will
bear
repetition
,
---
"
with

<EOS>
Cousin
Feenix
bows
to
Mr
Dombey
;
Mr
Dombey
solemnly
returns
the
bow
;
everybody
is
more
or
less
gratified
and
affected
by
this
extraordinary
,
and
perhaps
unprecedented
,
appeal
to
the
feelings

<EOS>
"
I
have
not

says
Cousin
Feenix
,
"
enjoyed
those
opportunities
which
I
could
have
desired
,
of
cultivating
the
acquaintance
of
my
friend
Dombey
,
and
studying
those
qualities
which
do
equal
honour
to
his
head
,
and
,
in
point
of
fact
,
to
his
heart
;
for
it
has
been
my
misfortune
to
be
,
as
we
used
to
say
in
my
time
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
when
it
was
not
the
custom
to
allude
to
the
Lords
,
and
when
the
order

parliamentary
proceedings
was
perhaps
better
observed
than
it
is
now
---

in
point

fact

says
Cousin
Feenix
,
cherishing
his
joke
,
with
great
slyness
,
and
finally
bringing
it
out
with
a
jerk
,

in
another
place

<EOS>
The
Major
falls
into
convulsions
,
and
is
recovered
with
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
know
sufficient
of
my
friend
Dombey
,
"
resumes
Cousin
Feenix
in
a
graver
tone
,
as
if
he
had
suddenly
become
a
sadder
and
wiser
man
,
"
to
know
that
he
is
,
in
point
of
fact
,
what
may
be
emphatically
called
a
---
a
merchant
---
a
British
merchant

and
a
---
and
a
man
.
<EOS>
And
although
I
have
been
resident
abroad
for
some
years
(
it
would
give
me
great
pleasure
to
receive
my
friend
Dombey

everybody

at
Baden

Baden

and
to
have
an
opportunity

making
'em
known

Duke

<EOS>
,
still
I
know
enough
,
I
flatter
myself
,
of
my
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
,
to
know
that
she
possesses
every
requisite
to
make
a
man
happy
,
and
that
her
marriage
with
my
friend
Dombey
is
one
of
inclination
and
affection
on
both
sides
.

<EOS>
Many
smiles
and
nods
from
Mr
Carker

<EOS>
"
Therefore
,
"
says
Cousin
Feenix
,
"
I
congratulate
the
family

which
I
am
a
member

on
the
acquisition

<EOS>
I
congratulate
my

on
his
union

my
lovely

accomplished
relative

possesses
every

man
happy

I
take
the
liberty
of
calling
on
you
all
,
in
point
of
fact
,
to
congratulate
both
my
friend
Dombey

my
lovely

accomplished
relative

occasion

<EOS>
The
speech
of
Cousin
Feenix
is
received
with
great
applause
,
and
Mr
Dombey
returns
thanks
on
behalf
of
himself
and
Mrs
Dombey
.

JB
shortly
afterwards
proposes
Mr

The
breakfast
languishes
when
that
is
done
,
the
violated
hatchments
are
avenged
,
and
Edith
rises
to
assume
her
travelling
dress
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
servants
in
the
meantime
,
have
been
breakfasting
below
.
<EOS>
Champagne
has
grown
too
common
among
them
to
be
mentioned
,
and
roast
fowls
,
raised
pies
,
and
lobster
-
salad
,
have
become
mere
drugs
.
<EOS>
The
very
tall
young
man
has
recovered
his
spirits
,
and
again
alludes
to
the
exciseman
.
<EOS>
His
comrade
's
eye
begins
to
emulate
his
own
,
and
he
,
too
,
stares
at
objects
without
taking
cognizance
thereof
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
general
redness
in
the
faces
of
the
ladies
;
in
the
face
of
Mrs
Perch
particularly
,
who
is
joyous
and
beaming
,
and
lifted
so
far
above
the
cares
of
life
,
that
if
she
were
asked
just
now
to
direct
a
wayfarer
to
Ball
's
Pond
,
where
her
own
cares
lodge
,
she
would
have
some
difficulty
in
recalling
the
way
.
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
has
proposed
the
happy
pair
;
to
which
the
silver
-
headed
butler
has
responded
neatly
,
and
with
emotion
;
for
he
half
begins
to
think
he
is
an
old
retainer
of
the
family
,
and
that
he
is
bound
to
be
affected
by
these
changes
.
<EOS>
The
whole
party
,
and
especially
the
ladies
,
are
very
frolicsome
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
cook
,
who
generally
takes
the
lead
in
society
,
has
said
,
it
is
impossible
to
settle
down
after
this
,
and
why
not
go
,
in
a
party
,
to
the
play
?
<EOS>
Everybody
(
Mrs
Perch
included
)
has
agreed
to
this
:
even
the
Native
,
who
is
tigerish
in
his
drink
,
and
who
alarms
the
ladies
(
Mrs
Perch
particularly
)
by
the
rolling
of
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
very
tall
young
men
has
even
proposed
a
ball
after
the
play
,
and
it
presents
itself
to
no
one
(
Mrs
Perch
included
)
in
the
light
of
an
impossibility
.
<EOS>
Words
have
arisen
between
the
housemaid
and
Mr
Towlinson
;
she
,
on
the
authority
of
an
old
saw
,
asserting
marriages
to
be
made
in
Heaven
:
he
,
affecting
to
trace
the
manufacture
elsewhere
;
he
,
supposing
that
she
says
so
,
because
she
thinks
of
being
married
her
own
self
:
she
,
saying
,
Lord
forbid
,
at
any
rate
,
that
she
should
ever
marry
him
.
<EOS>
To
calm
these
flying
taunts
,
the
silver
-
headed
butler
rises
to
propose
the
health
of
Mr
Towlinson
,
whom
to
know
is
to
esteem
,
and
to
esteem
is
to
wish
well
settled
in
life
with
the
object
of
his
choice
,
wherever
(
here
the
silver
-
headed
butler
eyes
the
housemaid
)
<EOS>
she
may
be
.
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
returns
thanks
in
a
speech
replete
with
feeling
,
of
which
the
peroration
turns
on
foreigners
,
regarding
whom
he
says
they
may
find
favour
,
sometimes
with
weak
and
inconstant
intellects
that
can
be
led
away
by
hair
,
but
all
he
hopes
,
is
,
he
may
never
hear
of
no
foreigner
never
boning
nothing
out
of
no
travelling
chariot
.
<EOS>
The
eye
of
Mr
Towlinson
is
so
severe
and
so
expressive
here
,
that
the
housemaid
is
turning
hysterical
,
when
she
and
all
the
rest
,
roused
by
the
intelligence
that
the
Bride
is
going
away
,
hurry
upstairs
to
witness
her
departure
.
  
<EOS>
The
chariot
is
at
the
door
;
the
Bride
is
descending
to
the
hall
,
where
Mr
Dombey
waits
for
her
.
<EOS>
Florence
is
ready
on
the
staircase
to
depart
too
;
and
Miss
Nipper
,
who
has
held
a
middle
state
between
the
parlour
and
the
kitchen
,
is
prepared
to
accompany
her
.
<EOS>
As
Edith
appears
,
Florence
hastens
towards
her
,
to
bid
her
farewell
.
  
<EOS>
Is
Edith
cold
,
that
she
should
tremble
!
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
unnatural
or
unwholesome
in
the
touch
of
Florence
,
that
the
beautiful
form
recedes
and
contracts
,
as
if
it
could
not
bear
<EOS>
it!Is
there
so
much
hurry
in
this
going
away
,
that
Edith
,
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
,
sweeps
on
,
and
is
gone
!
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
,
overpowered
by
her
feelings
as
a
mother
,
sinks
on
her
sofa
in
the
Cleopatra
attitude
,
when
the
clatter
of
the
chariot
wheels
is
lost
,
and
sheds
several
tears
.
<EOS>
The
Major
,
coming
with
the
rest
of
the
company
from
table
,
endeavours
to
comfort
her
;
but
she
will
not
be
comforted
on
any
terms
,
and
so
the
Major
takes
his
leave
.
<EOS>
Cousin
Feenix
takes
his
leave
,
and
Mr
Carker
takes
his
leave
.
<EOS>
The
guests
all
go
away
.
<EOS>
Cleopatra
,
left
alone
,
feels
a
little
giddy
from
her
strong
emotion
,
and
falls
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
Giddiness
prevails
below
stairs
too
.
<EOS>
The
very
tall
young
man
whose
excitement
came
on
so
soon
,
appears
to
have
his
head
glued
to
the
table
in
the
pantry
,
and
can
not
be
detached
from
it
.
<EOS>
A
violent
revulsion
has
taken
place
in
the
spirits
of
Mrs
Perch
,
who
is
low
on
account
of
Mr
Perch
,
and
tells
cook
that
she
fears
he
is
not
so
much
attached
to
his
home
,
as
he
used
to
be
,
when
they
were
only
nine
in
family
.
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
has
a
singing
in
his
ears
and
a
large
wheel
going
round
and
round
inside
his
head
.
<EOS>
The
housemaid
wishes
it
was
n't
wicked
to
with
that
one
was
dead
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
general
delusion
likewise
,
in
these
lower
regions
,
on
the
subject
of
time
;
everybody
conceiving
that
it
ought
to
be
,
at
the
earliest
,
ten
o'clock
at
night
,
whereas
it
is
not
yet
three
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
A
shadowy
idea
of
wickedness
committed
,
haunts
every
individual
in
the
party
;
and
each
one
secretly
thinks
the
other
a
companion
in
guilt
,
whom
it
would
be
agreeable
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
No
man
or
woman
has
the
hardihood
to
hint
at
the
projected
visit
to
the
play
.
<EOS>
Any
one
reviving
the
notion
of
the
ball
,
would
be
scouted
as
a
malignant
idiot
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
sleeps
up
stairs
,
two
hours
afterwards
,
and
naps
are
not
yet
over
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
The
hatchments
in
the
dining
-
room
look
down
on
crumbs
,
dirty
plates
,
spillings
of
wine
,
half
-
thawed
ice
,
stale
discoloured
heel
-
taps

scraps
of
lobster
,
drumsticks
of
fowls

and
pensive
jellies
,
gradually
resolving
themselves
into
a
lukewarm
gummy
soup

<EOS>
The
marriage
is
,
by
this
time
,
almost
as
denuded
to
its
show
and
garnish
as
the
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
servants
moralise
so
much
about
it
,
and
are
so
repentant
over
their
early
tea
,
at
home
,
that
by
eight
o'clock
or
so
,
they
settle
down
into
confirmed
seriousness
;
and
Mr
Perch
,
arriving
at
that
time
from
the
City
,
fresh
and
jocular
,
with
a
white
waistcoat
and
a
comic
song
,
ready
to
spend
the
evening
,
and
prepared
for
any
amount
of
dissipation
,
is
amazed
to
find
himself
coldly
received
,
and
Mrs
Perch
but
poorly
,
and
to
have
the
pleasing
duty
of
escorting
that
lady
home
by
the
next
omnibus

Night

<EOS>
Florence
having
rambled
through
the
handsome
house
,
from
room
to
room
,
seeks
her
own
chamber
,
where
the
care
of
Edith
has
surrounded
her
with
luxuries
and
comforts
;
and
divesting
herself
of
her
handsome
dress
,
puts
on
her
old
simple
mourning
for
dear
Paul
,
and
sits
down
to
read
,
with
Diogenes
winking
and
blinking
on
the
ground
beside
her
.
<EOS>
But
Florence
can
not
read
to

night

<EOS>
The
house
seems
strange

new

there
are
loud
echoes
in
it

<EOS>
There
is
a
shadow
on
her
heart

she
knows
not
why

what

it

heavy

Florence
shuts
her
book

gruff
Diogenes

who
takes
that
for
a
signal
,
puts
his
paws
upon
her
lap

and
rubs
his
ears
against
her
caressing
hands
.
<EOS>
But
Florence
can
not
see
him
plainly
,
in
a
little
time
,
for
there
is
a
mist
between
her
eyes
and
him

her
dead
brother

dead
mother
shine
in
it
like
angels

taken

driving
a

While

Night

like

Pale

again
comes
peeping

giving
place

sees
night

follows
it

cower

The
Wooden
Midshipman
goes
to
Pieces
 
<EOS>
HONEST
Captain
Cuttle
,
as
the
weeks
flew
over
him
in
his
fortified
retreat
,
by
no
means
abated
any
of
his
prudent
provisions
against
surprise
,
because
of
the
non
-
appearance
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
argued
that
his
present
security
was
too
profound
and
wonderful
to
endure
much
longer
;
he
knew
that
when
the
wind
stood
in
a
fair
quarter
,
the
weathercock
was
seldom
nailed
there
;
and
he
was
too
well
acquainted
with
the
determined
and
dauntless
character
of
Mrs
MacStinger
,
to
doubt
that
that
heroic
woman
had
devoted
herself
to
the
task
of
his
discovery
and
capture
.
<EOS>
Trembling
beneath
the
weight
of
these
reasons
,
Captain
Cuttle
lived
a
very
close
and
retired
life
;
seldom
stirring
abroad
until
after
dark
;
venturing
even
then
only
into
the
obscurest
streets
;
never
going
forth
at
all
on
Sundays
;
and
both
within
and
without
the
walls
of
his
retreat
,
avoiding
bonnets
,
as
if
they
were
worn
by
raging
lions
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
never
dreamed
that
in
the
event
of
his
being
pounced
upon
by
Mrs
MacStinger
,
in
his
walks
,
it
would
be
possible
to
offer
resistance
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
it
could
not
be
done
.
<EOS>
He
saw
himself
,
in
his
mind
's
eye
,
put
meekly
in
a
hackney
-
coach
,
and
carried
off
to
his
old
lodgings
.
<EOS>
He
foresaw
that
,
once
immured
there
,
he
was
a
lost
man
:
<EOS>
his
hat
gone
;
<EOS>
Mrs
MacStinger
watchful
of
him
day
and
night
;
reproaches
heaped
upon
his
head
,
before
the
infant
family
;
himself
the
guilty
object
of
suspicion
and
distrust
;
an
ogre
in
the
children
's
eyes
,
and
in
their
mother
's
a
detected
traitor
.
  
<EOS>
A
violent
perspiration
,
and
a
lowness
of
spirits
always
came
over
the
Captain
as
this
gloomy
picture
presented
itself
to
his
imagination
.
<EOS>
It
generally
did
so
previous
to
his
stealing
out
of
doors
at
night
for
air
and
exercise
.
<EOS>
Sensible
of
the
risk
<EOS>
he
ran
,
the
Captain
took
leave
of
Rob
,
at
those
times
,
with
the
solemnity
which
became
a
man
who
might
never
return
:
exhorting
him
,
in
the
event
of
his
(
the
Captain
's
)
being
lost
sight
of
,
for
a
time
,
to
tread
in
the
paths
of
virtue
,
and
keep
the
brazen
instruments
well
polished
.
  
<EOS>
But
not
to
throw
away
a
chance
;
and
to
secure
to
himself
a
means
,
in
case
of
the
worst
,
of
holding
communication
with
the
external
world
;
Captain
Cuttle
soon
conceived
the
happy
idea
of
teaching
Rob
the
Grinder
some
secret
signal
,
by
which
that
adherent
might
make
his
presence
and
fidelity
known
to
his
commander
,
in
the
hour
of
adversity
.
<EOS>
After
much
cogitation
,
the
Captain
decided
in
favour
of
instructing
him
to
whistle
the
marine
melody
,
"
Oh
cheerily
,
cheerily
!
"
<EOS>
and
Rob
the
Grinder
attaining
a
point
as
near
perfection
in
that
accomplishment
as
a
landsman
could
hope
to
reach
,
the
Captain
impressed
these
mysterious
instructions
on
his
mind
:
  
"
<EOS>
Now
,
my
lad
,
stand
by
!
<EOS>
If
ever
I
'm
took
---
"
   
"
Took
,
Captain
!
"
interposed
Rob
,
with
his
round
eyes
wide
open
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
darkly
,
"
if
ever
I
goes
away
,
meaning
to
come
back
to
supper
,
and
do
n't
come
within
hail
again
twenty
-
four
hours
arter
my
loss
,
go
you
to
Brig
Place
and
whistle
that
'
ere
tune
near
my
old
moorings
---
not
as
if
you
was
a
meaning
of
it
<EOS>
,
you
understand
,
but
as
if
you
'd
drifted
there
,
promiscuous
.
<EOS>
If
I
answer
in
that
tune
,
you
sheer
off
,
my
lad
,
and
come
back
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
arterwards
;
if
I
answer
in
another
tune
,
do
you
stand
off
and
on
,
and
wait
till
I
throw
out
further
signals
.
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
them
orders
,
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
stand
off
and
on
of
,
Captain
?
"
inquired
Rob
.
<EOS>
"
The
horse
-
road
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
smart
lad
for
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
Captain
,
eyeing
him
sternly
,
"
as
do
n't
know
his
own
native
alphabet
!
<EOS>
Go
away
a
bit
and
come
back
again
alternate
---
d'ye
<EOS>
understand
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Captain
,
"
said
Rob
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
my
lad
,
then
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
relenting
.
<EOS>
"
Do
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
That
he
might
do
it
the
better
,
Captain
Cuttle
sometimes
condescended
,
of
an
evening
after
the
shop
was
shut
,
to
rehearse
this
scene
:
retiring
into
the
parlour
for
the
purpose
,
as
into
the
lodgings
of
a
supposititious
MacStinger
,
and
carefully
observing
the
behaviour
of
his
ally
,
from
the
hole
of
espial
he
had
cut
in
the
wall
.
<EOS>
Rob
the
Grinder
discharged
himself
of
his
duty
with
so
much
exactness
and
judgment
,
when
thus
put
to
the
proof
,
that
the
Captain
presented
him
,
at
divers
times
,
with
seven
sixpences
,
in
token
of
satisfaction
;
and
gradually
felt
stealing
over
his
spirit
the
resignation
of
a
man
who
had
made
provision
for
the
worst
,
and
taken
every
reasonable
precaution
against
an
unrelenting
fate
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
the
Captain
did
not
tempt
ill
-
fortune
,
by
being
a
whit
more
venturesome
than
before
.
<EOS>
Though
he
considered
it
a
point
of
good
breeding
in
himself
,
as
a
general
friend
of
the
family
,
to
attend
Mr
Dombey
's
wedding
(
of
which
he
had
heard
from
Mr
Perch
)
,
and
to
show
that
gentleman
a
pleasant
and
approving
countenance
from
the
gallery
,
he
had
repaired
to
the
church
in
a
hackney
cabriolet
with
both
windows
up
;
and
might
have
scrupled
even
to
make
that
venture
,
in
his
dread
of
Mrs
MacStinger
,
but
that
the
lady
's
attendance
on
the
ministry
of
the
Reverend
Melchisedech
rendered
it
peculiarly
unlikely
that
she
would
be
found
in
communion
with
the
Establishment
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
got
safe
home
again
,
and
fell
into
the
ordinary
routine
of
his
new
life
,
without
encountering
any
more
direct
alarm
from
the
enemy
,
than
was
suggested
to
him
by
the
daily
bonnets
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
But
other
subjects
began
to
lay
heavy
on
the
Captain
's
mind
.
<EOS>
Walter
's
ship
was
still
unheard
of
.
<EOS>
No
news
came
of
old
Sol
Gills
.
<EOS>
Florence
did
not
even
know
of
the
old
man
's
disappearance
,
and
Captain
Cuttle
had
not
the
heart
to
tell
her
.
<EOS>
Indeed
the
Captain
,
as
his
own
hopes
of
the
generous
,
handsome
,
gallant
-
hearted
youth
,
whom
he
had
loved
,
according
to
his
rough
manner
,
from
a
child
,
began
to
fade
,
and
faded
more
and
more
from
day
to
day
,
shrink
with
instinctive
pain
from
the
thought
of
exchanging
a
word
with
Florence
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
had
good
news
to
carry
to
her
,
the
honest
Captain
would
have
braved
the
newly
decorated
house
and
splendid
furniture
---
though
these
,
connected
with
the
lady
he
had
seen
at
church
,
were
awful
to
him
---
and
made
his
away
into
her
presence
.
<EOS>
With
a
dark
horizon
gathering
around
their
common
hopes
,
however
,
that
darkened
every
hour
,
the
Captain
almost
felt
as
if
he
were
a
new
misfortune
and
affliction
to
her
;
and
was
scarcely
less
afraid
of
a
visit
from
Florence
,
than
from
Mrs
MacStinger
herself
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
chill
dark
autumn
evening
,
and
Captain
Cuttle
had
ordered
a
fire
to
be
kindled
in
the
little
back
parlour
,
now
more
than
ever
like
the
cabin
of
a
ship
.
<EOS>
The
rain
fell
fast
,
and
the
wind
blew
hard
;
and
straying
out
on
the
house
-
top
by
that
stormy
bedroom
of
his
old
friend
,
to
take
an
observation
of
the
weather
,
the
Captain
's
heart
died
within
him
,
when
he
saw
how
wild
and
desolate
it
was
.
<EOS>
Not
that
he
associated
the
weather
of
that
time
with
poor
Walter
's
destiny
,
or
doubted
that
if
Providence
had
doomed
him
to
be
lost
and
shipwrecked
,
it
was
over
,
long
ago
;
but
that
beneath
an
outward
influence
,
quite
distinct
from
the
subject
-
matter
of
his
thoughts
,
the
Captain
's
spirits
sank
,
and
his
hopes
turned
pale
,
as
those
of
wiser
men
had
often
done
before
him
,
and
will
often
do
again
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
addressing
his
face
to
the
sharp
wind
and
slanting
rain
,
looked
up
at
the
heavy
scud
that
was
flying
fast
over
the
wilderness
of
house
-
tops
,
and
looked
for
something
cheery
there
in
vain
.
<EOS>
The
prospect
near
at
hand
was
no
better
.
<EOS>
In
sundry
tea
-
chests
and
other
rough
boxes
at
his
feet
,
the
pigeons
of
Rob
the
Grinder
were
cooing
like
so
many
dismal
breezes
getting
up
.
<EOS>
A
crazy
weathercock
of
a
midshipman
,
with
a
telescope
at
his
eye
,
once
visible
from
the
street
,
but
long
bricked
out
,
creaked
and
complained
upon
his
rusty
pivot
as
the
shrill
blast
spun
him
round
and
round
,
and
sported
with
him
cruelly
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
Captain
's
coarse
blue
vest
the
cold
raindrops
started
like
steel
beads
;
and
he
could
hardly
maintain
himself
aslant
against
the
stiff
Nor'-Wester
that
came
pressing
against
him
,
importunate
to
topple
him
over
the
parapet
,
and
throw
him
on
the
pavement
below
.
<EOS>
If
there
were
any
Hope
alive
that
evening
,
the
Captain
thought
,
as
he
held
his
hat
on
,
it
certainly
kept
house
,
and
was
n't
out
of
doors
;
so
the
Captain
,
shaking
his
head
in
a
despondent
manner
,
went
in
to
look
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
descended
slowly
to
the
little
back
parlour
,
and
,
seated
in
his
accustomed
chair
,
looked
for
it
in
the
fire
;
but
it
was
not
there
,
though
the
fire
was
bright
.
<EOS>
He
took
out
his
tobacco
-
box
and
pipe
,
and
composing
himself
to
smoke
,
looked
for
it
in
the
red
glow
from
the
bowl
,
and
in
the
wreaths
of
vapour
that
curled
upward
from
his
lips
;
but
there
was
not
so
much
as
an
atom
of
the
rust
of
Hope
's
anchor
in
either
.
<EOS>
He
tried
a
glass
of
grog
;
but
melancholy
truth
was
at
the
bottom
of
that
well
,
and
he
could
n't
finish
it
.
<EOS>
He
made
a
turn
or
two
in
the
shop
,
and
looked
for
Hope
among
the
instruments
;
but
they
obstinately
worked
out
reckonings
for
the
missing
ship
,
in
spite
of
any
opposition
he
could
offer
,
that
ended
at
the
bottom
of
the
lone
sea
.
  
<EOS>
The
wind
still
rushing
,
and
the
rain
still
pattering
,
against
the
closed
shutters
,
the
Captain
brought
to
before
the
Wooden
Midshipman
upon
the
counter
,
and
thought
,
as
he
dried
the
little
officer
's
uniform
with
his
sleeve
,
how
many
years
the
Midshipman
had
seen
,
during
which
few
changes
---
hardly
any
---
had
transpired
among
his
ship
's
company
;
how
the
changes
had
come
all
together
,
one
day
,
as
it
might
be
;
and
of
what
a
sweeping
kind
they
were
.
<EOS>
Here
was
the
little
society
of
the
back
parlour
broken
up
,
and
scattered
far
and
wide
.
<EOS>
Here
was
no
audience
for
Lovely
Peg
,
even
if
there
had
been
anybody
to
sing
it
,
which
there
was
not
,
for
the
Captain
was
as
morally
certain
that
nobody
but
he
could
execute
that
ballad
,
as
he
was
that
he
had
not
the
spirit
,
under
existing
circumstances
,
to
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
bright
face
of
"
Wal'r
"
in
the
house
;
---
here
the
Captain
transferred
his
sleeve
for
a
moment
from
the
Midshipman
's
uniform
to
his
own
cheek
;
---
the
familiar
wig
and
buttons
of
Sol
Gills
were
a
vision
of
the
past
;
Richard
Whittington
was
knocked
on
the
head
;
and
every
plan
and
project
,
in
connexion
with
the
Midshipman
,
lay
drifting
,
without
mast
or
rudder
,
on
the
waste
of
waters
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
Captain
,
with
a
dejected
face
,
stood
revolving
these
thoughts
,
and
polishing
the
Midshipman
,
partly
in
the
tenderness
of
old
acquaintance
,
and
partly
in
the
absence
of
his
mind
,
a
knocking
at
the
shop
-
door
communicated
a
frightful
start
to
the
frame
of
Rob
the
Grinder
,
seated
on
the
counter
,
whose
large
eyes
had
been
intently
fixed
on
the
Captain
's
face
,
and
who
had
been
debating
within
himself
,
for
the
five
hundredth
time
,
whether
the
Captain
could
have
done
a
murder
,
that
he
had
such
an
evil
conscience
,
and
was
always
running
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
,
softly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Somebody
's
knuckles
,
Captain
,
"
answered
Rob
the
Grinder
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
with
an
abashed
and
guilty
air
,
immediately
sneaked
on
tiptoe
to
the
little
parlour
and
locked
himself
in
.
<EOS>
Rob
,
opening
the
door
,
would
have
parleyed
with
the
visitor
on
the
threshold
if
the
visitor
had
come
in
female
guise
;
but
the
figure
being
of
the
male
sex
,
and
Rob
's
orders
only
applying
to
women
,
Rob
held
the
door
open
and
allowed
it
to
enter
:
which
it
did
very
quickly
,
glad
to
get
out
of
the
driving
rain
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
job
for
Burgess
and
Co.
at
any
rate
,
"
said
the
visitor
,
looking
over
his
shoulder
compassionately
at
his
own
legs
,
which
were
very
wet
and
covered
with
splashes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
-
de
-
do
,
Mr
Gills
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
salutation
was
addressed
to
the
Captain
,
now
emerging
from
the
back
parlour
with
a
most
transparent
and
utterly
futile
affectation
of
coming
out
by
accident
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
"
the
gentleman
went
on
to
say
in
the
same
breath
;
"
I
'm
very
well
indeed
,
myself
,
I
'm
much
obliged
to
you
.
<EOS>
My
name
is
Toots
,
---
Mister
Toots
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
remembered
to
have
seen
this
young
gentleman
at
the
wedding
,
and
made
him
a
bow
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
replied
with
a
chuckle
;
and
being
embarrassed
,
as
he
generally
was
,
breathed
hard
,
shook
hands
with
the
Captain
for
a
long
time
,
and
then
falling
on
Rob
the
Grinder
,
in
the
absence
of
any
other
resource
,
shook
hands
with
him
in
a
most
affectionate
and
cordial
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
;
I
should
like
to
speak
a
word
to
you
,
Mr
Gills
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
Toots
at
length
,
with
surprising
presence
of
mind
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
<EOS>
Miss
DOM
you
know
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
with
responsive
gravity
and
mystery
,
immediately
waved
his
hook
towards
the
little
parlour
,
whither
Mr
Toots
followed
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
though
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
looking
up
in
the
Captain
's
face
as
he
sat
down
in
a
chair
by
the
fire
,
which
the
Captain
placed
for
him
;
"
you
do
n't
happen
to
know
the
Chicken
at
all
;
do
you
,
Mr
Gills
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Chicken
?
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Game
Chicken
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
shaking
his
head
<EOS>
,
Mr
Toots
explained
that
the
man
alluded
to
was
the
celebrated
public
character
who
had
covered
himself
and
his
country
with
glory
in
his
contest
with
the
Nobby
Shropshire
One
;
but
this
piece
of
information
did
not
appear
to
enlighten
the
Captain
very
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
he
's
outside
:
that
's
all
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
of
no
consequence
;
he
wo
n't
get
very
wet
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
pass
the
word
for
him
in
a
moment
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
you
would
have
the
goodness
to
let
him
sit
in
the
shop
with
your
young
man
,
"
chuckled
Mr
Toots
,
"
I
should
be
glad
;
because
,
you
know
,
he
's
easily
offended
,
and
the
damp
's
rather
bad
for
his
stamina
.
<EOS>
I
'll
call
him
in
,
Mr
Gills
.
<EOS>
"
  
With
that
,
Mr
Toots
repairing
to
the
shop
-
door
,
sent
a
peculiar
whistle
into
the
night
,
which
produced
a
stoical
gentleman
in
a
shaggy
white
great
-
coat
and
a
flat
-
brimmed
hat
,
with
very
short
hair
,
a
broken
nose
,
and
a
considerable
tract
of
bare
and
sterile
country
behind
each
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
Chicken
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
The
compliant
Chicken
spat
out
some
small
pieces
of
straw
on
which
he
was
regaling
himself
,
and
took
in
a
fresh
supply
from
a
reserve
he
carried
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
an't
no
drain
of
nothing
short
handy
,
is
there
?
"
said
the
Chicken
,
generally
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
here
sluicing
night
is
hard
lines
to
a
man
as
lives
on
his
condition
.
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
proffered
a
glass
of
rum
,
which
the
Chicken
,
throwing
back
his
head
,
emptied
into
himself
,
as
into
a
cask
,
after
proposing
the
brief
sentiment
,
"
Towards
us
!
"
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
and
the
Captain
returning
then
to
the
parlour
,
and
taking
their
seats
before
the
fire
<EOS>
,
Mr
Toots
began
:
  
"
Mr
Gills
---
"
  
"
Awast
!
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
My
name
's
Cuttle
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
looked
greatly
disconcerted
,
while
the
Captain
proceeded
gravely
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Cap'en
Cuttle
is
my
name
,
and
England
is
my
nation
,
this
here
is
my
dwelling
-
place
,
and
blessed
be
creation
---
Job
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
as
an
index
to
his
authority
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
could
n't
see
Mr
Gills
,
could
I
?
"
said
Mr
Toots
;
"
because
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
could
see
Sol
Gills
,
young
gen'l'm'n
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
impressively
,
and
laying
his
heavy
hand
on
Mr
Toots
's
knee
,
"
old
Sol
,
mind
you
---
with
your
own
eyes
---
<EOS>
as
you
sit
there
---
you
'd
be
welcome
to
me
,
than
a
wind
astarn
,
to
a

becalmed

<EOS>
But
you
ca
n't
see
Sol
Gills
.
<EOS>
And
why
ca
n't
you
see
Sol
Gills
?
"
said
the
Captain
,
apprised
by
the
face
of
Mr
Toots
that
he
was
making
a
profound
impression
on
that
gentleman
's
mind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Because
he
's
inwisible
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
in
his
agitation
was
going
to
reply
that
it
was
of
no
consequence
at
all
.
<EOS>
But
he
corrected
himself
,
and
said
,
"
Lor
bless
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
there
man
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
has
left
me
in
charge
here
by
a
piece
of
writing
,
but
though
he
was
a'most
as
good
as
my
sworn
brother
,
I
know
no
more
where
he
's
gone
,
or
why
he
's
gone
;
if
so
be
to
seek
his
nevy
,
or
if
so
be
along
of
being
not
quite
settled
in
his
mind
;
than
you
do
.
<EOS>
One
morning
at
daybreak
,
he
went
over
the
side
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
without
a
splash
,
without
a
ripple
.
<EOS>
I
have
looked
for
that
man
high
and
low
,
and
never
set
eyes
,
nor
ears
,
nor
nothing
else
,
upon
him
,
from
that
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
good
Gracious
,
Miss
Dombey
do
n't
know
---
"
Mr
Toots
began
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
ask
you
,
as
a
feeling
heart
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
dropping
his
voice
,
"
why
should
she
know
?
<EOS>
why
should
she
be
made
to
know
,
until
such
time
as
there
warn't
<EOS>
any
help
for
it
?
<EOS>
She
took
to
old
Sol
Gills
,
did
that
sweet
creetur
,
with
a
kindness
,
with
a
affability
,
with
a
<EOS>
---
what
's
the
good
of
saying
so
?
<EOS>
you
know
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
hope
so
,
"
chuckled
Mr
Toots
,
with
a
conscious
blush
that
suffused
his
whole
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
come
here
from
her
?
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
,
"
chuckled
Mr
Toots
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
all
I
need
observe
,
is
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
that
you
know
a
angel
,
and
are
chartered
bya
angel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
instantly
seized
the
Captain
's
hand
,
and
requested
the
favour
of
his
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
and
honour
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
earnestly
,
"
I
should
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
if
you
'd
improve
my
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
know
you
,
Captain
,
very
much
.
<EOS>
I
really
am
in
want
of
a
friend
,
I
am
.
<EOS>
Little
Dombey
was
my
friend
at
old
Blimber
's
,
and
would
have
been
now
,
if
he
'd
have
lived
.
<EOS>
The
Chicken
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
in
a
forlorn
whisper
,
"
is
very
well
---
admirable
in
his
way
---
<EOS>
the
sharpest
man
perhaps
in
the
world
<EOS>
;
there
's
not
a
move
he
is
n't
up
to
,
everybody
says
so
---
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
know
---
he
's
not
everything
.
<EOS>
So
she
isan
angel
,
Captain
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
an
angel
anywhere
,
it
's
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
've
always
said
.
<EOS>
Really
though
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
I
should
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
if
you
'd
cultivate
my
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
received
this
proposal
in
a
polite
manner
,
but
still
without
committing
himself
to
its
acceptance
;
merely
observing
,
"
Aye
,
aye
,
my
lad
.
<EOS>
We
shall
see
,
we
shall
see
;
"
and
reminding
Mr
Toots
of
his
immediate
mission
,
by
inquiring
to
what
he
was
indebted
for
the
honour
of
that
visit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
the
fact
is
,
"
replied
Mr
Toots
,
"
that
it
's
the
young
woman
I
come
from
.
<EOS>
Not
Miss
Dombey
---
Susan
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
nodded
his
head
once
,
with
a
grave
expression
of
face
,
indicative
of
his
regarding
that
young
woman
with
serious
respect
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
'll
tell
you
how
it
happens
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
I
go
and
call
sometimes
,
on
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
go
there
on
purpose
,
you
know
,
but
I
happen
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
very
often
;
and
when
I
find
myself
there
,
why
---
why
I
call
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nat'rally
,
"
observed
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
I
called
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
and
honour
,
I
do
n't
think
it
's
possible
to
form
an
idea
of
the
angel
Miss
Dombey
was
this
afternoon
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
answered
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
,
implying
that
it
might
not
be
easy
to
some
people
,
but
was
quite
so
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
was
coming
out
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
the
young
woman
,
in
the
most
unexpected
manner
,
took
me
into
the
pantry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
seemed
,
for
the
moment
,
to
object
to
this
proceeding
:
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
looked
at
Mr
Toots
with
a
distrustful
,
if
not
threatening
visage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
she
brought
out
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
this
newspaper
.
<EOS>
She
told
me
that
she
had
kept
it
from
Miss
Dombey
all
day
,
on
account
of
something
that
was
in
it
,
about
somebody
that
she
and
Dombey
used
to
know
;
and
then
she
read
the
passage
to
me
.
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Then
she
said
---
wait
a
minute
;
what
was
it
she
said
,
though
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
endeavouring
to
concentrate
his
mental
powers
on
this
question
,
unintentionally
fixed
the
Captain
's
eye
,
and
was
so
much
discomposed
by
its
stern
expression
,
that
his
difficulty
in
resuming
the
thread
of
his
subject
was
enhanced
to
a
painful
extent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Mr
Toots
after
long
consideration
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
ah!Yes
!
<EOS>
She
said
that
she
hoped
there
was
a
bare
possibility
that
it
might
n't
be
true
;
and
that
as
she
could
n't
very
well
come
out
herself
,
without
surprising
Miss
Dombey
,
would
I
go
down
to
Mr
Solomon
Gills
the
Instrument
-
maker
's
in
this
street
,
who
was
the
party
's
uncle
,
and
ask
whether
he
believed
it
was
true
,
or
had
heard
anything
else
in
the
City
.
<EOS>
She
said
,
if
he
could
n't
speak
to
me
,
no
doubt
Captain
Cuttle
could
.
<EOS>
By
the
bye
!
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
as
the
discovery
flashed
upon
him
,
"
you
,
you
know
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
glanced
at
the
newspaper
in
Mr
Toots
's
hand
,
and
breathed
short
and
hurriedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
pursued
Mr
Toots
,
"
<EOS>
the
reason
why
I
'm
rather
late
is
,
because
I
went
up
as
far
as
Finchley
first
,
to
get
some
uncommonly
fine
chickweed
that
grows
there
,
for
Miss
Dombey
's
bird
.
<EOS>
But
I
came
on
here
,
directly
afterwards
.
<EOS>
You
've
seen
the
paper
,
I
suppose
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
who
had
become
cautious
of
reading
the
news
,
lest
he
should
find
himself
advertised
at
full
length
by
Mrs
MacStinger
,
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
read
the
passage
to
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
making
a
sign
in
the
affirmative
,
Mr
Toots
read
as
follows
,
from
the
Shipping
Intelligence
:
  
"
<EOS>
"
Southampton
.
<EOS>
The
barque
Defiance
,
Henry
James
,
Commander
,
arrived
in
this
port
to
-
day
,
with
a
cargo
of
sugar
,
coffee
,
and
rum
,
reports
that
being
becalmed
on
the
sixth
day
of
her
passage
home
from
Jamaica
,
in
"
---
in
such
and
such
a
latitude
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
after
making
a
feeble
dash
at
the
figures
,
and
tumbling
over
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
"
cried
the
Captain
,
striking
his
clenched
hand
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
Heave
ahead
,
my
lad
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
---
latitude
,
"
repeated
Mr
Toots
,
with
a
startled
glance
at
the
Captain
,
"
and
longitude
so
-
and
-
so
,
---
"
the
look
-
out
observed
,
half
an
hour
before
sunset
,
some
fragments
of
a
wreck
,
drifting
at
about
the
distance
of
a
mile
.
<EOS>
The
weather
being
clear
,
and
the
barque
making
no
way
,
a
boat
was
hoisted
out
,
with
orders
to
inspect
the
same
,
when
they
were
found
to
consist
of
sundry
large
spars
,
and
a
part
of
the
main
rigging
of
an
English
brig
,
of
about
five
hundred
tons
burden
,
together
with
a
portion
of
the
stern
on
which
the
words
and
letters
"
Son
and
H
---
"
were
yet
plainly
legible
.
<EOS>
No
vestige
of
any
dead
body
was
to
be
seen
upon
the
floating
fragments
.
<EOS>
Log
of
the
Defiance
states
,
that
a
breeze
springing
up
in
the
night
,
the
wreck
was
seen
no
more
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
doubt
that
all
surmises
as
to
the
fate
of
the
missing
vessel
,
the
Son
and
Heir
,
port
of
London
,
bound
for
Barbadoes
,
are
now
set
at
rest
for
ever
;
that
she
broke
up
in
the
last
hurricane
;
and
that
every
soul
on
board
perished
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Captain
Cuttle
,
like
all
mankind
,
little
knew
how
much
hope
had
survived
within
him
under
discouragement
,
until
he
felt
its
death
-
shock
.
<EOS>
During
the
reading
of
the
paragraph
,
and
for
a
minute
or
two
afterwards
,
he
sat
with
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
modest
Mr
Toots
,
like
a
man
entranced
;
then
,
suddenly
rising
,
and
putting
on
his
glazed
hat
,
which
,
in
his
visitor
's
honour
,
he
had
laid
upon
the
table
,
the
Captain
turned
his
back
,
and
bent
his
head
down
on
the
little
chimneypiece
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
upon
my
word
and
honour
,
"
cried
Mr
Toots
,
whose
tender
heart
was
moved
by
the
Captain
's
unexpected
distress
,
"
this
is
a
most
wretched
sort
of
affair
this
world
is

<EOS>
Somebody
's
always
dying
,
or
going
and
doing
something
uncomfortable
in
it

<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
never
should
have
looked
forward
so
much
,
to
coming
into
my
property
,
if
I
had
known
this

I
never
saw
such
a
world

It
's
a
great
deal
worse

Blimber

<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
without
altering
his
position
,
signed
to
Mr
Toots
not
to
mind
him
;
and
presently
turned
round
,
with
his
glazed
hat
thrust
back
upon
his
ears
,
and
his
hand
composing
and
smoothing
his
brown
face

,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
farewell
!
<EOS>
Wal'r
<EOS>
my
child
,
my
boy
,
and
man
,
I
loved
you
!
<EOS>
He
warn't
<EOS>
my
flesh
and
blood
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
looking
at
the
fire
---
<EOS>
"
I
an't
got
none
---
but
something
of
what
a
father
feels
when
he
loses
a
son
,
I
feel
in
losing
Wal'r
.
<EOS>
For
why
?
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
Because
it
an't
one
loss
,
but
a
round
dozen
.
<EOS>
Where
's
that
there
young
school
-
boy
with
the
rosy
face
and
curly
hair
,
that
used
to
be
as
merry
in
this
here
parlour
,
come
round
every
week
,
as
a
piece
of
music
?
<EOS>
Gone
down
with
Wal'r
.
<EOS>
Where
's
that
there
fresh
lad
,
that
nothing
could
n't
tire
nor
put
out
,
and
that
sparkled
up
and
blushed
so
,
when
we
joked
him
about
Heart
's
Delight
,
that
he
was
beautiful
to
look
at
?
<EOS>
Gone
down
with
Wal'r
.
<EOS>
Where
's
that
there
man
's
spirit
,
all
afire
,
that
would
n't
see
the
old
man
hove
down
for
a
minute
,
and
cared
nothing
for
itself
?
<EOS>
Gone
down
with
Wal'r
.
<EOS>
It
an't
one
Wal'r
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
dozen
Wal'rs
that
I
know'd
and
loved
,
all
holding
round
his
neck
when
he
went
down
,
and
they
're
a
-
holding
round
mine
now
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
sat
silent
:
folding
and
refolding
the
newspaper
as
small
as
possible
upon
his
knee
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
Sol
Gills
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
gazing
at
the
fire
,
"
poor
nevyless
old
Sol
,
where
are
you
got
to
!
<EOS>
you
was
left
in
charge
of
me
;
his
last
words
was
,
"
Take
care
of
my
uncle
!
"
<EOS>
What
came
over
you
,
Sol
,
when
you
went
and
gave
the
go
-
bye
to
Ned
Cuttle
;
and
what
am
I
to
put
in
my
accounts
<EOS>
that
he
's
a
looking
down
upon
,
respecting
you
!
<EOS>
Sol
Gills
,
Sol
Gills
!
"
said
the
Captain
,
shaking
his
head
slowly
,
"
catch
sight
of
that
there
newspaper
,
away
from
home
,
with
no
one
as
know'd
Wal'r
by
,
to
say
a
word
;
and
broadside
to
you
broach
,
and
down
you
pitch
,
head
foremost
!
"
  
<EOS>
Drawing
a
heavy
sigh
,
the
Captain
turned
to
Mr
Toots
,
and
roused
himself
to
a
sustained
consciousness
of
that
gentleman
's
presence
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lad
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
you
must
tell
the
young
woman
honestly
that
this
here
fatal
news
is
too
correct
.
<EOS>
They
do
n't
romance
,
you
see
,
on
such
pints
.
<EOS>
It
's
entered
on
the
ship
's
log
,
and
that
's
the
truest
book
as
a
man
can
write
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
morning
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
I
'll
step
out
and
make
inquiries
;
but
they
'll
lead
to
no
good
.
<EOS>
They
ca
n't
do
it
.
<EOS>
If
you
'll
give
me
a
look
-
in
in
the
forenoon
,
you
shall
know
what
I
have
heerd
;
but
tell
the
young
woman
from
Cap'en
Cuttle
,
that
it
's
over
.
<EOS>
Over
!
"
<EOS>
And
the
Captain
,
hooking
off
his
glazed
hat
,
pulled
his
handkerchief
out
of
the
crown
,
wiped
his
grizzled
head
despairingly
,
and
tossed
the
handkerchief
in
again
,
with
the
indifference
of
deep
dejection
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
<EOS>
really
I
am
dreadfully
sorry
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
I
am
,
though
I
was
n't
acquainted
with
the
party
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
Miss
Dombey
will
be
very
much
affected
,
Captain
Gills
---
I
mean
Mr
Cuttle
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Lord
love
you
,
"
returned
the
Captain
,
with
something
of
compassion
for
Mr
Toots
's
innocence
.
<EOS>
"
When
she
warn't
no
higher
than
that
,
they
were
as
fond
of
one
another
as
two
young
doves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Were
they
though
!
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
with
a
considerably
lengthened
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
were
made
for
one
another
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
mournfully
;
"
but
what
signifies
that
now
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
and
honour
,
"
cried
Mr
Toots
,
blurting
out
his
words
through
a
singular
combination
of
awkward
chuckles
and
emotion
,
"
I
'm
even
more
sorry
than
I
was
before
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
Captain
Gills
,
I
---
I
positively
adore
Miss
Dombey
;
---
I
---
I
am
perfectly
sore
with
loving
her
;
"
the
burst
with
which
this
confession
forced
itself
out
of
the
unhappy
Mr
Toots
,
bespoke
the
vehemence
of
his
feelings
;
"
but
what
would
be
the
good
of
my
regarding
her
in
this
manner
,
if
I
was
n't
truly
sorry
for
her
feeling
pain
<EOS>
,
whatever
was
the
cause
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mine
an't
<EOS>
a
selfish
affection
<EOS>
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
in
the
confidence
engendered
by
his
having
been
a
witness
of
the
Captain
's
tenderness
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
sort
of
thing
with
me
,
Captain
Gills
,
that
if
I
could
be
run
over
---
or
---
or
trampled
upon
---
or
---
or
thrown
off
a
very
high
place
---
or
anything
of
that
sort
---
for
Miss
Dombey
's
sake
,
it
would
be
the
most
delightful
thing
that
could
happen
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
All
this
,
Mr
Toots
said
in
a
suppressed
voice
,
to
prevent
its
reaching
the
jealous
ears
of
the
Chicken
,
who
objected
to
the
softer
emotions
;
<EOS>
which
effort
of
restraint
,
coupled
with
the
intensity
of
his
feelings
,
made
him
red
to
the
tips
of
his
ears
,
and
caused
him
to
present
such
an
affecting
spectacle
of
disinterested
love
to
the
eyes
of
Captain
Cuttle
,
that
the
good
Captain
patted
him
consolingly
on
the
back
,
and
bade
him
cheer
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
it
's
kind
of
you
,
in
the
midst
of
your
own
troubles
,
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
I
'm
very
much
obliged
to
you
.
<EOS>
As
I
said
before
,
I
really
want
a
friend
,
and
should
be
glad
to
have
your
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Although
I
am
very
well
off
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
with
energy
,
"
you
ca
n't
think
what
a
miserable
Beast
I
am
.
<EOS>
The
hollow
crowd
,
you
know
,
when
they
see
me
with
the
Chicken
,
and
characters
of
distinction
like
that
,
suppose
me
to
be
happy
;
but
I
'm
wretched
.
<EOS>
I
suffer
for
Miss
Dombey
,
Captain
Gills
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
get
through
my
meals
;
I
have
no
pleasure
in
my
tailor
;
I
often
cry
when
I
'm
alone
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
it
'll
be
a
satisfaction
to
me
to
come
back
to
-
morrow
,
or
to
come
back
fifty
times
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
with
these
words
,
shook
the
Captain
's
hand
;
and
disguising
such
traces
of
his
agitation
as
could
be
disguised
on
so
short
a
notice
,
before
the
Chicken
's
penetrating
glance
,
rejoined
that
eminent
gentleman
in
the
shop
.
<EOS>
The
Chicken
,
who
was
apt
to
be
jealous
of
his
ascendancy
,
eyed
Captain
Cuttle
with
anything
but
favour
as
he
took
leave
of
Mr
Toots
;
but
followed
his
patron
without
being
otherwise
demonstrative
of
his
ill
-
will
:
leaving
the
Captain
oppressed
with
sorrow
;
and
Rob
the
Grinder
elevated
with
joy
,
on
account
of
having
had
the
honour
of
staring
for
nearly
half
an
hour
at
the
conqueror
of
the
Nobby
Shropshire
One
.
  
<EOS>
Long
after
Rob
was
fast
asleep
in
his
bed
under
the
counter
,
the
Captain
sat
looking
at
the
fire
;
and
long
after
there
was
no
fire
to
look
at
the
Captain
sat
gazing
on
the
rusty
bars
,
with
unavailing
thoughts
of
Walter
and
old
Sol
crowding
through
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Retirement
to
the
stormy
chamber
at
the
top
of
the
house
brought
no
rest
with
it
;
and
the
Captain
rose
up
in
the
morning
,
sorrowful
and
unrefreshed
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
City
offices
were
open
,
the
Captain
issued
forth
to
the
counting
-
house
of
Dombey
and
Son
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
opening
of
the
Midshipman
's
windows
that
morning
.
<EOS>
Rob
the
Grinder
,
by
the
Captain
's
orders
,
left
the
shutters
closed
,
and
the
house
was
as
a
house
of
death
.
  
<EOS>
It
chanced
that
Mr
Carker
was
entering
the
office
,
as
Captain
Cuttle
arrived
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Receiving
the
Manager
's
benison
gravely
and
silently
,
Captain
Cuttle
made
bold
to
accompany
him
into
his
own
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
taking
up
his
usual
position
before
the
fireplace
,
and
keeping
on
his
sat
,
"
this
is
a
bad
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
received
the
news
as
was
in
print
yesterday
,
Sir
?
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
"
we
have
received
it
!
<EOS>
It
was
accurately
stated
.
<EOS>
The
underwriters
suffer
a
considerable
loss
.
<EOS>
We
are
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
No
help
!
<EOS>
Such
is
life
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
pared
his
nails
delicately
with
a
penknife
,
and
smiled
at
the
Captain
,
who
was
standing
by
the
door
looking
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
excessively
regret
poor
Gay
,
"
said
Carker
,
"
and
the
crew
.
<EOS>
I
understand
there
were
some
of
our
very
best
men
among
'em
.
<EOS>
It
always
happens
so
.
<EOS>
Many
men
with
families
too
.
<EOS>
A
comfort
to
reflect
that
poor
Gay
had
no
family
,
Captain
Cuttle
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
stood
rubbing
his
chin
,
and
looking
at
the
Manager
.
<EOS>
The
Manager
glanced
at
the
unopened
letters
lying
on
his
desk
,
and
took
up
the
newspaper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anything
I
can
do
for
you
,
Captain
Cuttle
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
looking
off
it
,
with
a
smiling
and
expressive
glance
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
could
set
my
mind
at
rest
,
<EOS>
Sir
,
on
something
it
's
uneasy
about
,
"
returned
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
"
exclaimed
the
Manager
,
"
what
's
that
?
<EOS>
Come
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
I
must
trouble
you
to
be
quick
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
am
much
engaged
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lookee
here
<EOS>
,
Sir
"
said
the
Captain
,
advancing
a
step
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Afore
my
friend
Wal'r
went
on
this
here
disastrous
voyage
"
  
"
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
interposed
the
smiling
Manager
,
"
do
n't
talk
about
disastrous
voyages
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
We
have
nothing
to
do
with
disastrous
voyages
here
,
my
good
fellow
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
begun
very
early
on
your
day
's
allowance
,
Captain
,
if
you
do
n't
remember
that
there
are
hazards
in
all
voyages
whether
by
sea
or
land
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
made
uneasy
by
the
supposition
that
young
what's
-
his
-
name
was
lost
in
bad
weather
that
was
got
up
against
him
in
these
offices
---
are
you
?
<EOS>
Fie
,
Captain
!
<EOS>
Sleep
,
and
soda
-
water
,
are
the
best
cures
for
such
uneasiness
as
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
lad
,
"
returned
the
Captain
,
slowly
---
<EOS>
"
you
are
a'most
a
lad
to
me
,
and
so
I
do
n't
ask
your
pardon
for
that
slip
of
a
word
,
---
<EOS>
if
you
find
any
pleasure
in
this
here
sport
,
you
an't
<EOS>
the
gentleman
I
took
you
for
,
<EOS>
and
if
you
an't
<EOS>
the
gentleman
I
took
you
for
,
may
be
my
mind
<EOS>
has
call
to
be
uneasy
.
<EOS>
Now
this
is
what
it
is
,
Mr
Carker
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Afore
that
poor
lad
went
away
,
according
to
orders
,
he
told
me
that
he
warn't
<EOS>
a
going
away
for
his
own
good
,
or
for
promotion
,
<EOS>
he
know'd
.
<EOS>
It
was
my
belief
that
he
was
wrong
,
and
I
told
him
so
,
and
I
come
here
,
your
head
governor
being
absent
,
to
ask
a
question
or
two
of
you
in
a
civil
way
,
for
my
own
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Them
questions
you
answered
---
free
.
<EOS>
Now
it
'll
ease
my
mind
to
know
,
when
all
is
over
,
as
it
is
,
and
when
what
ca
n't
be
cured
must
be
endoored
---
for
which
,
as
a
scholar
,
you
'll
overhaul
the
book
it
's
in
,
and
thereof
make
a
note
---
to
know
once
more
,
in
a
word
,
that
I
warn't
mistaken
;
that
I
warn't
<EOS>
back'ard
in
my
duty
when
I
did
n't
tell
the
old
man
what
Wal'r
told
me
;
and
that
the
wind
was
truly
in
his
sail
,
when
he
highsted
of
it
for
Barbadoes
Harbour
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
in
the
goodness
of
his
nature
,
"
when
I
was
here
last
,
we
was
very
pleasant
together
.
<EOS>
If
I
ai
n't
been
altogether
so
pleasant
myself
this
morning
,
on
account
of
this
poor
lad
,
and
if
I
have
chafed
again
any
observation
of
yours
that
I
might
have
fended
off
,
my
name
is
Ed'ard
Cuttle
,
and
I
ask
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
returned
the
Manager
,
with
all
possible
politeness
,
"
I
must
ask
you
to
do
me
a
favour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
it
,
Sir
?
"
inquired
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
have
the
goodness
to
walk
off
,
if
you
please
,
"
rejoined
the
Manager
,
stretching
forth
his
arm
,
"
and
to
carry
your
jargon
somewhere
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
Every
knob
in
the
Captain
's
face
turned
white
with
astonishment
and
indignation
;
even
the
red
rim
on
his
forehead
faded
,
like
a
rainbow
among
the
gathering
clouds
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
said
the
Manager
,
shaking
his
forefinger
at
him
,
and
showing
him
all
his
teeth
,
but
still
amiably
smiling
,
"
I
was
much
too
lenient
with
you
when
you
came
here
before
.
<EOS>
You
belong
to
an
artful
and
audacious
set
of
people
.
<EOS>
In
my
desire
to
save
young
what's
-
his
-
name
from
being
kicked
out
this
place
,
neck
and
crop
,
my
good
Captain
,
I
tolerated
you
;
but
for
once
,
and
only
once
.
<EOS>
Now
,
go
,
my
friend
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
was
absolutely
rooted
to
the
ground
,
and
speechless
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
,
"
said
the
good
-
humoured
Manager
,
gathering
up
his
skirts
,
and
standing
astride
upon
the
hearth
-
rug
,
"
like
a
sensible
fellow
,
and
let
us
have
no
turning
out
,
or
any
such
violent
measures
.
<EOS>
If
Mr
Dombey
were
here
,
Captain
,
you
might
be
obliged
to
leave
in
a
more
ignominious
manner
,
possibly
.
<EOS>
I
merely
say
,
Go
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
laying
his
ponderous
hand
upon
his
chest
,
to
assist
himself
in
fetching
a
deep
breath
,
looked
at
Mr
Carker
from
head
to
foot
,
and
looked
round
the
little
room
,
as
if
he
did
not
clearly
understand
where
he
was
,
or
in
what
company
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
deep
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
pursued
Carker
,
with
the
easy
and
vivacious
frankness
of
a
man
of
the
world
who
knew
the
world
too
well
to
be
ruffled
by
any
discovery
of
misdoing
,
when
it
did
not
immediately
concern
himself
;
"
but
you
are
not
quite
out
of
soundings
,
either
---
<EOS>
neither
you
nor
your
absent
friend
,
Captain
.
<EOS>
What
have
you
done
with
your
absent
friend
,
hey
?
"
  
<EOS>
Again
the
Captain
laid
his
hand
upon
his
chest
.
<EOS>
After
drawing
another
deep
breath
,
he
conjured
himself
to
"
stand
by
!
"
<EOS>
But
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
hatch
nice
little
plots
,
and
hold
nice
little
councils
,
and
make
nice
little
appointments
,
and
receive
nice
little
visitors
,
too
,
Captain
,
hey
?
"
said
Carker
,
bending
his
brows
upon
him
,
without
showing
his
teeth
any
the
less
:
"
<EOS>
but
it
's
a
bold
measure
to
come
here
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Not
like
your
discretion
!
<EOS>
You
conspirators
,
and
hiders
,
and
runners
-
away
,
should
know
better
than
that
.
<EOS>
Will
you
oblige
me
by
going
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lad
,
"
gasped
the
Captain
,
in
a
choked
and
trembling
voice
,
and
with
a
curious
action
going
on
in
the
ponderous
fist
;
"
there
's
a
many
words
I
could
wish
to
say
to
you
,
but
I
do
n't
rightly
know
where
they
're
stowed
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
My
young
friend
,
Wal'r
,
was
drownded
only
last
night
,
according
to
my
reckoning
,
and
it
puts
me
out
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
But
you
and
me
will
come
alongside
o
'
one
another
again
,
my
lad
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
holding
up
his
hook
,
"
if
we
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
anything
but
shrewd
in
you
,
my
good
fellow
,
if
we
do
,
"
returned
the
Manager
,
with
the
same
frankness
;
"
for
you
may
rely
,
I
give
you
fair
warning
,
upon
my
detecting
and
exposing
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
pretend
to
be
a
more
moral
man
than
my
neighbours
,
my
good
Captain
;
but
the
confidence
of
this
house
,
or
of
any
member
of
this
house
,
is
not
to
be
abused
and
undermined
while
I
have
eyes
and
ears
.
<EOS>
Good
day
!
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
nodding
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
looking
at
him
steadily
(
Mr
Carker
looked
full
as
steadily
at
the
Captain
)
,
went
out
of
the
office
and
left
him
standing
astride
before
the
fire
,
as
calm
and
pleasant
as
if
there
were
no
more
spots
upon
his
soul
than
on
his
pure
white
linen
,
and
his
smooth
sleek
skin
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
glanced
,
in
passing
through
the
outer
counting
-
house
,
at
the
desk
where
he
knew
poor
Walter
had
been
used
to
sit
,
now
occupied
by
another
young
boy
,
with
a
face
almost
as
fresh
and
hopeful
as
his
on
the
day
when
they
tapped
the
famous
last
bottle
but
one
of
the
old
Madeira
,
in
the
little
back
parlour
.
<EOS>
The
association
of
ideas
,
thus
awakened
,
did
the
Captain
a
great
deal
of
good
;
it
softened
him
in
the
very
height
of
his
anger
,
and
brought
the
tears
into
his
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
Wooden
Midshipman
's
again
,
and
sitting
down
in
a
corner
of
the
dark
shop
,
the
Captain
's
indignation
,
strong
as
it
was
,
could
make
no
head
against
his
grief
.
<EOS>
Passion
seemed
not
only
to
do
wrong
and
violence
to
the
memory
of
the
dead
,
but
to
be
infected
by
death
,
and
to
droop
and
decline
beside
it
.
<EOS>
All
the
living
knaves
and
liars
in
the
world
,
were
nothing
to
the
honesty
and
truth
of
one
dead
friend
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
thing
the
honest
Captain
made
out
clearly
,
in
this
state
of
mind
,
besides
the
loss
of
Walter
was
,
that
with
him
almost
the
whole
world
of
Captain
Cuttle
had
been
drowned
.
<EOS>
If
he
reproached
himself
sometimes
,
and
keenly
too
,
for
having
ever
connived
at
Walter
's
innocent
deceit
,
he
thought
at
least
as
often
of
the
Mr
Carker
whom
no
sea
could
ever
render
up
;
and
the
Mr
Dombey
,
whom
he
now
began
to
perceive
was
as
far
beyond
human
recall
;
and
the
"
Heart
's
Delight
,
"
with
whom
he
must
never
forgather
again
;
and
the
Lovely
Peg
,
that
teak
-
built
and
trim
ballad
,
that
had
gone
ashore
upon
a
rock
,
and
split
into
mere
planks
and
beams
of
rhyme
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
sat
in
the
dark
shop
,
thinking
of
these
things
,
to
the
entire
exclusion
of
his
own
injury
;
and
looking
with
as
sad
an
eye
upon
the
ground
,
as
if
in
contemplation
of
their
actual
fragments
as
they
floated
past
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
Captain
was
not
unmindful
,
for
all
that
,
of
such
decent
and
respectful
observances
in
memory
of
poor
Walter
,
as
he
felt
within
his
power
.
<EOS>
Rousing
himself
,
and
rousing
Rob
the
Grinder
(
who
in
the
unnatural
twilight
was
fast
asleep
)
,
the
Captain
sallied
forth
with
his
attendant
at
his
heels
,
and
the
door
-
key
in
his
pocket
,
and
repairing
to
one
of
those
convenient
slop
-
selling
establishments
of
which
there
is
abundant
choice
at
the
eastern
end
of
London
,
purchased
on
the
spot
two
suits
of
mourning
---
one
for
Rob
the
Grinder
,
which
was
immensely
too
small
,
and
one
for
himself
,
which
was
immensely
too
large
.
<EOS>
He
also
provided
Rob
with
a
species
of
hat
,
greatly
to
be
admired
for
its
symmetry
and
usefulness
,
as
well
as
for
a
happy
blending
of
the
mariner
with
the
coal
-
heaver
;
which
is
usually
termed
a
sou'wester
;
and
which
was
something
of
a
novelty
in
connexion
with
the
instrument
business
.
<EOS>
In
their
several
garments
,
which
the
vendor
declared
to
be
such
a
miracle
in
point
of
fit
as
nothing
but
a
rare
combination
of
fortuitous
circumstances
ever
brought
about
,
and
the
fashion
of
which
was
unparalleled
within
the
memory
of
the
oldest
inhabitant
,
the
Captain
and
Grinder
immediately
arrayed
themselves
:
presenting
a
spectacle
fraught
with
wonder
to
all
who
beheld
it
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
altered
form
,
the
Captain
received
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
took
aback
,
my
lad
,
at
present
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
and
will
only
confirm
that
there
ill
news
.
<EOS>
Tell
the
young
woman
to
break
it
gentle
to
the
young
lady
,
and
for
neither
of
'em
never
to
think
of
me
no
more
---
'
special
,
mind
you
,
that
is
---
though
I
will
think
of
them
,
when
night
comes
on
a
hurricane
and
seas
is
mountains
rowling
,
for
which
overhaul
your
Doctor
Watts
,
brother
,
and
when
found
make
a
note
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
reserved
,
until
some
fitter
time
,
the
consideration
of
Mr
Toots
's
offer
of
friendship
,
and
thus
dismissed
him
.
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
's
spirits
were
so
low
,
in
truth
,
that
he
half
determined
,
that
day
,
to
take
no
further
precautions
against
surprise
from
Mrs
MacStinger
,
but
to
abandon
himself
recklessly
to
chance
,
and
be
indifferent
to
what
might
happen
.
<EOS>
As
evening
came
on
,
he
fell
into
a
better
frame
of
mind
,
however
;
and
spoke
much
of
Walter
to
Rob
the
Grinder
,
whose
attention
and
fidelity
he
likewise
incidentally
commended
.
<EOS>
Rob
did
not
blush
to
hear
the
Captain
earnest
in
his
praises
,
but
sat
staring
at
him
,
and
affecting
to
snivel
with
sympathy
,
and
making
a
feint
of
being
virtuous
,
and
treasuring
up
every
word
he
said
(
like
a
young
spy
as
he
was
)
with
very
promising
deceit
.
  
<EOS>
When
Rob
had
turned
in
,
and
was
fast
asleep
,
the
Captain
trimmed
the
candle
,
put
on
his
spectacles
---
he
had
felt
it
appropriate
to
take
to
spectacles
on
entering
into
the
Instrument
Trade
,
though
his
eyes
were
like
a
hawk
's
---
and
opened
the
prayer
-
book
at
the
Burial
Service
.
<EOS>
And
reading
softly
to
himself
,
in
the
little
back
parlour
,
and
stopping
now
and
then
to
wipe
his
eyes
,
the
Captain
,
in
a
true
and
simple
spirit
,
committed
Walter
's
body
to
the
deep
.

Contrasts
 
<EOS>
TURN
we
our
eyes
upon
two
homes
;
not
lying
side
by
side
,
but
wide
apart
,
though
both
within
easy
range
and
reach
of
the
great
city
of
London
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
is
situated
in
the
green
and
wooded
country
near
Norwood
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
a
mansion
;
it
is
of
no
pretensions
as
to
size
;
but
it
is
beautifully
arranged
,
and
tastefully
kept
.
<EOS>
The
lawn
,
the
soft
,
smooth
slope
,
the
flower
-
garden
,
the
clumps
of
trees
where
graceful
forms
of
ash
and
willow
are
not
wanting
,
the
conservatory
,
the
rustic
verandah
with
sweet
-
smelling
creeping
plants
entwined
about
the
pillars
,
the
simple
exterior
of
the
house
,
the
well
-
ordered
offices
,
though
all
upon
the
diminutive
scale
proper
to
a
mere
cottage
,
bespeak
an
amount
of
elegant
comfort
within
,
that
might
serve
for
a
palace
.
<EOS>
This
indication
is
not
without
warrant
;
for
within
it
is
a
house
of
refinement
and
luxury
.
<EOS>
Rich
colours
,
excellently
blended
,
meet
the
eye
at
every
turn
;
in
the
furniture
---
its
proportions
admirably
devised
to
suit
the
shapes
and
sizes
of
the
small
rooms
;
on
the
walls
;
upon
the
floors
;
tingeing
and
subduing
the
light
that
comes
in
through
the
odd
glass
doors
and
windows
here
and
there
.
<EOS>
There
are
a
few
choice
prints
and
pictures
too
;
in
quaint
nooks
and
recesses
there
is
no
want
of
books
;
and
there
are
games
of
skill
and
chance
set
forth
on
tables
---
fantastic
chessmen
,
dice
,
backgammon
,
cards
,
and
billiards
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
amidst
this
opulence
of
comfort
,
there
is
something
in
the
general
air
that
is
not
well
.
<EOS>
Is
it
that
the
carpets
and
the
cushions
are
too
soft
and
noiseless
,
so
that
those
who
move
or
repose
among
them
seem
to
act
by
stealth
?
<EOS>
Is
it
that
the
prints
and
pictures
do
not
commemorate
great
thoughts
or
deeds
,
or
render
nature
in
the
poetry
of
landscape
,
hall
,
or
hut
,
but
are
of
one
voluptuous
cast
---
mere
shows
of
form
and
colour
---
and
no
more
?
<EOS>
Is
it
that
the
books
have
all
their
gold
outside
,
and
that
the
titles
of
the
greater
part
qualify
them
to
be
companions
of
the
prints
and
pictures
?
<EOS>
Is
it
that
the
completeness
and
the
beauty
of
the
place
are
here
and
there
belied
by
an
affectation
of
humility
,
in
some
unimportant
and
inexpensive
regard
,
which
is
as
false
as
the
face
of
the
too
truly
painted
portrait
hanging
yonder
,
or
its
original
at
breakfast
in
his
easy
chair
below
it
?
<EOS>
Or
is
it
that
,
with
the
daily
breath
of
that
original
and
master
of
all
here
,
there
issues
forth
some
subtle
portion
of
himself
,
which
gives
a
vague
expression
of
himself
to
everything
about
him
?
  
<EOS>
It
is
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
who
sits
in
the
easy
chair
.
<EOS>
A
gaudy
parrot
in
a
burnished
cage
upon
the
table
tears
at
the
wires
with
her
beak
,
and
goes
walking
,
upside
down
,
in
its
dome
-
top
,
shaking
her
house
and
screeching
;
but
Mr
Carker
is
indifferent
to
the
bird
,
and
looks
with
a
musing
smile
at
a
picture
on
the
opposite
wall
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
most
extraordinary
accidental
likeness
,
certainly
,
"
says
he
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
is
a
Juno
;
perhaps
a
Potiphar
's
Wife
;
perhaps
some
scornful
Nymph
---
<EOS>
according
as
the
Picture
Dealers
found
the
market
,
when
they
christened
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
figure
of
a
woman
,
supremely
handsome
,
who
,
turning
away
,
but
with
her
face
addressed
to
the
spectator
,
flashes
her
proud
glance
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
like
Edith
.
  
<EOS>
With
a
passing
gesture
of
his
hand
at
the
picture
---
what
!
<EOS>
a
menace
?
<EOS>
No
;
yet
something
like
it
.
<EOS>
A
wave
as
of
triumph
?
<EOS>
No
;
yet
more
like
that
.
<EOS>
An
insolent
salute
wafted
from
his
lips
?
<EOS>
No
;
yet
like
that
too
---
he
resumes
his
breakfast
,
and
calls
to
the
chafing
and
imprisoned
bird
,
who
coming
down
into
a
pendant
gilded
hoop
within
the
cage
,
like
a
great
wedding
-
ring
,
swings
in
it
,
for
his
delight
.
  
<EOS>
The
second
home
is
on
the
other
side
of
London
,
near
to
where
the
busy
great
north
road
of
bygone
days
is
silent
and
almost
deserted
,
except
by
wayfarers
who
toil
along
on
foot
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
poor
,
small
house
,
barely
and
sparely
furnished
,
but
very
clean
;
and
there
is
even
an
attempt
to
decorate
it
,
shown
in
the
homely
flowers
trained
about
the
porch
and
in
the
narrow
garden
.
<EOS>
The
neighbourhood
in
which
it
stands
has
as
little
of
the
country
to
recommend
it
,
as
it
has
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
It
is
neither
of
the
town
nor
country
.
<EOS>
The
former
,
like
the
giant
in
his
travelling
boots
,
has
made
a
stride
and
passed
it
,
and
has
set
his
brick
-
and
-
mortar
heel
a
long
way
in
advance
;
but
the
intermediate
space
between
the
giant
's
feet
,
as
yet
,
is
only
blighted
country
,
and
not
town
;
and
,
here
,
among
a
few
tall
chimneys
belching
smoke
all
day
and
night
,
and
among
the
brick
-
fields
and
the
lanes
where
turf
is
cut
,
and
where
the
fences
tumble
down
,
and
where
the
dusty
nettles
grow
,
and
where
a
scrap
or
two
of
hedge
may
yet
be
seen
,
and
where
the
bird
-
catcher
still
comes
occasionally
,
though
he
swears
every
time
to
come
no
more
---
this
second
home
is
to
be
found
.
  
<EOS>
She
who
inhabits
it
,
is
she
who
left
the
first
in
her
devotion
to
an
outcast
brother
.
<EOS>
She
withdrew
from
that
home
its
redeeming
spirit
,
and
from
its
master
's
breast
his
solitary
angel
:
but
though
his
liking
for
her
is
gone
,
after
this
ungrateful
slight
as
he
considers
it
;
and
though
he
abandons
her
altogether
in
return
,
an
old
idea
of
her
is
not
quite
forgotten
even
by
him
.
<EOS>
Let
her
flower
-
garden
,
in
which
he
never
sets
his
foot
,
but
which
is
yet
maintained
,
among
all
his
costly
alterations
,
as
if
she
had
quitted
it
but
yesterday
,
bear
witness
!
  
<EOS>
Harriet
Carker
has
changed
since
then
,
and
on
her
beauty
there
has
fallen
a
heavier
shade
than
Time
of
his
unassisted
self
can
cast
,
all
-
potent
as
he
is
---
the
shadow
of
anxiety
and
sorrow
,
and
the
daily
struggle
of
a
poor
existence
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
beauty
still
;
and
still
a
gentle
,
quiet
,
and
retiring
beauty
that
must
be
sought
out
,
<EOS>
for
it
can
not
vaunt
itself
;
if
it
could
,
it
would
be
what
it
is
,
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
This
slight
,
small
,
patient
figure
,
neatly
dressed
in
homely
stuffs
,
and
indicating
nothing
but
the
dull
,
household
virtues
,
that
have
so
little
in
common
with
the
received
idea
of
heroism
and
greatness
,
unless
,
indeed
,
any
ray
of
them
should
shine
through
the
lives
of
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
,
when
it
becomes
a
constellation
and
is
tracked
in
Heaven
straightway
---
this
slight
,
small
,
patient
figure
,
leaning
on
the
man
still
young
but
worn
and
grey
,
is
she
,
his
sister
,
who
,
of
all
the
world
,
went
over
to
him
in
his
shame
and
put
her
hand
in
his
,
and
with
a
sweet
composure
and
determination
,
led
him
hopefully
upon
his
barren
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
early
,
John
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
go
so
early
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
many
minutes
earlier
than
usual
,
Harriet
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
the
time
to
spare
,
I
should
like
,
I
think
---
it
's
a
fancy
---
to
walk
once
by
the
house
where
I
took
leave
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
ever
seen
or
known
him
,
John
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
better
as
it
is
,
my
dear
,
remembering
his
fate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
could
not
regret
it
more
,
though
I
had
known
him
.
<EOS>
Is
not
your
sorrow
mine
?
<EOS>
And
if
I
had
,
perhaps
you
would
feel
that
I
was
a
better
companion
to
you
in
speaking
about
him
,
than
I
may
seem
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
sister
!
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
within
the
range
of
rejoicing
or
regret
,
in
which
I
am
not
sure
of
your
companionship
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
think
not
,
John
,
for
surely
there
is
nothing
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
could
you
be
better
to
me
,
or
nearer
to
me
then
,
than
you
are
in
this
,
or
anything
?
"
said
her
brother
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
feel
that
you
did
know
him
,
Harriet
,
and
that
you
shared
my
feelings
towards
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
drew
the
hand
which
had
been
resting
on
his
shoulder
,
round
his
neck
,
and
answered
,
with
some
hesitation
:
  
"
No
,
not
quite
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
,
true
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
;
"
you
think
I
might
have
done
him
no
harm
if
I
had
allowed
myself
to
know
him
better
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Think
!
<EOS>
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Designedly
,
Heaven
knows
I
would
not
,
"
he
replied
,
shaking
his
head
mournfully
;
"
but
his
reputation
was
too
precious
to
be
perilled
by
such
association
.
<EOS>
Whether
you
share
that
knowledge
,
or
do
not
,
my
dear
---
"
  
"
I
do
not
,
"
she
said
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
still
the
truth
,
Harriet
,
and
my
mind
<EOS>
is
lighter
when
I
think
of
him
for
that
which
made
it
so
much
heavier
then
.
"
<EOS>
He
checked
himself
in
his
tone
of
melancholy
,
and
smiled
upon
her
as
he
said
"
Good
-
bye
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
dear
John
!
<EOS>
In
the
evening
,
at
the
old
time
and
place
,
I
shall
meet
you
as
usual
on
your
way
home
.
<EOS>
Goodbye
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
cordial
face
she
lifted
up
to
his
to
kiss
him
,
was
his
home
,
his
life
,
his
universe
,
and
yet
it
was
a
portion
of
his
punishment
and
grief
;
for
in
the
cloud
he
saw
upon
it
---
though
serene
and
calm
as
any
radiant
cloud
at
sunset
---
and
<EOS>
in
the
constancy
and
devotion
of
her
life
,
and
in
the
sacrifice
she
had
made
of
ease
,
enjoyment
,
and
hope
,
he
saw
the
bitter
fruits
of
his
old
crime
,
for
ever
ripe
and
fresh
.
  
<EOS>
She
stood
at
the
door
looking
after
him
,
with
her
hands
loosely
clasped
in
each
other
,
as
he
made
his
way
over
the
frowzy
and
uneven
patch
of
ground
which
lay
before
their
house
,
which
had
once
(
and
not
long
ago
)
been
a
pleasant
meadow
,
and
was
now
a
very
waste
,
with
a
disorderly
crop
of
beginnings
of
mean
houses
,
rising
out
of
the
rubbish
,
as
if
they
had
been
unskilfully
sown
there
.
<EOS>
Whenever
he
looked
back
---
<EOS>
as
once
or
twice
he
did
---
<EOS>
her
cordial
face
shone
like
a
light
upon
his
heart
;
but
when
he
plodded
on
his
way
,
and
saw
her
not
,
the
tears
were
in
her
eyes
as
she
stood
watching
him
.
  
<EOS>
Her
pensive
form
was
not
long
idle
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
There
was
daily
duty
to
discharge
,
and
daily
work
to
do
---
for
such
commonplace
spirits
that
are
not
heroic
,
often
work
hard
with
their
hands
---
and
Harriet
was
soon
busy
with
her
household
tasks
.
<EOS>
These
discharged
,
and
the
poor
house
made
quite
neat
and
orderly
,
she
counted
her
little
stock
of
money
,
with
an
anxious
face
,
and
went
out
thoughtfully
to
buy
some
necessaries
for
their
table
,
planning
and
contriving
,
as
she
went
,
how
to
save
.
<EOS>
So
sordid
are
the
lives
of
such
low
natures
,
who
are
not
only
not
heroic
to
their
valets
and
waiting
-
women
,
but
have
neither
valets
nor
waiting
-
women
to
be
heroic
to
withal
!
  
<EOS>
While
she
was
absent
,
and
there
was
no
one
in
the
house
,
there
approached
it
by
a
different
way
from
that
the
brother
had
taken
,
a
gentleman
,
a
very
little
past
his
prime
of
life
perhaps
,
but
of
a
healthy
florid
hue
,
an
upright
presence
,
and
a
bright
clear
aspect
,
that
was
gracious
and
good
-
humoured
.
<EOS>
His
eyebrows
were
still
black
,
and
so
was
much
of
his
hair
;
the
sprinkling
of
grey
observable
among
the
latter
,
graced
the
former
very
much
,
and
showed
his
broad
frank
brow
and
honest
eyes
to
great
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
After
knocking
once
at
the
door
,
and
obtaining
no
response
,
this
gentleman
sat
down
on
a
bench
in
the
little
porch
to
wait
.
<EOS>
A
certain
skilful
action
of
his
fingers
as
he
hummed
some
bars
,
and
beat
time
on
the
seat
beside
him
,
seemed
to
denote
the
musician
;
and
the
extraordinary
satisfaction
he
derived
from
humming
something
very
slow
and
long
,
which
had
no
recognisable
tune
,
seemed
to
denote
that
he
was
a
scientific
one
.
  
<EOS>
The
gentleman
was
still
twirling
a
theme
,
which
seemed
to
go
round
and
round
and
round
,
and
in
and
in
and
in
,
and
to
involve
itself
like
a
corkscrew
twirled
upon
a
table
,
without
getting
any
nearer
to
anything
,
when
Harriet
appeared
returning
.
<EOS>
He
rose
up
as
she
advanced
,
and
stood
with
his
head
uncovered
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
come
again
,
Sir
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
faltering
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
take
that
liberty
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
for
five
minutes
of
your
leisure
?
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
she
opened
the
door
,
and
gave
him
admission
to
the
little
parlour
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
sat
down
there
,
drew
his
chair
to
the
table
over
against
her
,
and
said
,
in
a
voice
that
perfectly
corresponded
to
his
appearance
,
and
with
a
simplicity
that
was
very
engaging
:
  
"
<EOS>
Miss
Harriet
,
you
can
not
be
proud
.
<EOS>
You
signified
to
me
,
when
I
called
t'other
morning
,
that
you
were
.
<EOS>
Pardon
me
if
I
say
that
I
looked
into
your
face
while
you
spoke
,
and
that
it
contradicted
you
.
<EOS>
I
look
into
it
again
,
"
he
added
,
laying
his
hand
gently
on
her
arm
,
for
an
instant
,
"
and
it
contradicts
you
more
and
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
somewhat
confused
and
agitated
,
and
could
make
no
ready
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
mirror
of
truth
,
"
said
her
visitor
,
"
and
gentleness
.
<EOS>
Excuse
my
trusting
to
it
,
and
returning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
manner
of
saying
these
words
,
divested
them
entirely
of
the
character
of
compliments
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
plain
,
grave
,
unaffected
,
and
sincere
,
that
she
bent
her
head
,
as
if
at
once
to
thank
him
,
and
acknowledge
his
sincerity
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
disparity
between
our
ages
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
"
and
the
plainness
of
my
purpose
,
empower
me
<EOS>
,
I
am
glad
to
think
,
to
speak
my
mind
.
<EOS>
That
is
my
mind
;
and
so
you
see
me
for
the
second
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
kind
of
pride
,
Sir
,
"
She
returned
,
after
a
moment
's
silence
,
"
or
what
may
be
supposed
to
be
pride
,
which
is
mere
duty
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
cherish
no
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
yourself
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
---
pardon
me
---
"
suggested
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
your
brother
John
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Proud
of
his
love
,
I
am
,
"
said
Harriet
,
looking
full
upon
her
visitor
,
and
changing
her
manner
on
the
instant
---
<EOS>
not
that
it
was
less
composed
and
quiet
,
but
that
there
was
a
deep
impassioned
earnestness
in
it
that
made
the
very
tremble
in
her
voice
a
part
of
her
firmness
,
"
and
proud
of
him
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
you
who
strangely
know
the
story
of
his
life
,
and
repeated
it
to
me
when
you
were
here
last
---
"
  
"
Merely
to
make
my
way
into
your
confidence
,
"
interposed
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
heaven
's
sake
,
do
n't
suppose
---
"
  
"
I
am
sure
,
"
she
said
,
"
you
revived
it
,
in
my
hearing
,
with
a
kind
and
good
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
,
"
returned
her
visitor
,
pressing
her
hand
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
do
me
justice
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
You
were
going
to
say
,
that
I
,
who
know
the
story
of
John
Carker
's
life
---
"
  
"
May
think
it
pride
in
me
,
"
she
continued
,
"
when
I
say
that
I
am
proud
of
him
!
<EOS>
I
am
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
time
was
,
when
I
was
not
---
when
I
could
not
be
---
<EOS>
but
that
is
past
.
<EOS>
The
humility
of
many
years
,
the
uncomplaining
expiation
,
the
true
repentance
,
the
terrible
regret
,
the
pain
<EOS>
I
know
he
has
even
in
my
affection
,
which
he
think
has
cost
me
dear
,
though
Heaven
knows
I
am
happy
,
but
for
his
sorrow
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
oh
,
Sir
,
after
what
I
have
seen
,
let
me
conjure
you
,
if
you
are
in
any
place
of
power
,
and
are
ever
wronged
,
never
,
for
any
wrong
,
inflict
a
punishment
that
can
not
be
recalled
;
while
there
is
a
GOD
above
us
to
work
changes
in
the
hearts
He
made
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
brother
is
an
altered
man
,
"
returned
the
gentleman
,
compassionately
.
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
I
do
n't
doubt
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
an
altered
man
when
he
did
wrong
,
"
said
Harriet
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
an
altered
man
again
,
and
is
his
true
self
now
,
believe
me
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
we
go
on
,
"
said
her
visitor
,
rubbing
his
forehead
,
in
an
absent
manner
,
with
his
hand
,
and
then
drumming
thoughtfully
on
the
table
,
"
we
go
on
in
our
clockwork
routine
,
from
day
to
day
,
and
ca
n't
make
out
,
or
follow
,
these
changes
.
<EOS>
They
---
they
're
a
metaphysical
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
We
---
we
have
n't
leisure
for
it
.
<EOS>
We
---
we
have
n't
courage
.
<EOS>
They
're
not
taught
at
schools
or
colleges
,
and
we
do
n't
know
how
to
set
about
it
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
we
are
so
dd
business
-
like
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
walking
to
the
window
,
and
back
,
and
sitting
down
again
,
in
a
state
of
extreme
dissatisfaction
and
vexation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
rubbing
his
forehead
again
;
and
drumming
on
the
table
as
before
,
"
I
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
a
jog
-
trot
life
,
the
same
from
day
to
day
,
would
reconcile
one
to
anything
.
<EOS>
One
do
n't
see
anything
,
one
do
n't
hear
anything
,
one
do
n't
know
anything
;
that
's
the
fact
.
<EOS>
We
go
on
taking
everything
for
granted
,
and
so
we
go
on
,
until
whatever
we
do
,
good
,
bad
,
or
indifferent
,
we
do
from
habit
.
<EOS>
Habit
is
all
I
shall
have
to
report
,
when
I
am
called
upon
to
plead
to
my
conscience
,
on
my
death
-
bed
.
"
<EOS>
Habit
,
"
says
I
;
"
I
was
deaf
,
dumb
,
blind
,
and
paralytic
,
to
a
million
things
,
from
habit
.
"
<EOS>
"
Very
business
-
like
indeed
,
Mr
What's
-
your
-
name
,
"
says
Conscience
,
"
but
it
wo
n't
do
here
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
The
gentleman
got
up
and
walked
to
the
window
again
and
back
:
seriously
uneasy
,
though
giving
his
uneasiness
this
peculiar
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Harriet
,
"
he
said
,
resuming
his
chair
,
"
I
wish
you
would
let
me
serve
you
.
<EOS>
Look
at
me
;
I
ought
to
look
honest
,
for
I
know
I
am
so
,
at
present
.
<EOS>
Do
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
answered
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
every
word
you
have
said
,
"
he
returned
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
full
of
self
-
reproach
that
I
might
have
known
this
and
seen
this
,
and
known
you
and
seen
you
,
any
time
these
dozen
years
,
and
that
I
never
have
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
how
I
ever
got
here
---
<EOS>
creature
that
I
am
,
not
only
of
my
own
habit
,
but
of
other
people's!But
<EOS>
having
done
so
,
let
me
do
something
.
<EOS>
I
ask
it
in
all
honour
and
respect
.
<EOS>
You
inspire
me
with
both
,
in
the
highest
degree
.
<EOS>
Let
me
do
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
contented
,
Sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
not
quite
,
"
returned
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
quite
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
little
comforts
that
might
smooth
your
life
,
and
his
.
<EOS>
And
his
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
,
fancying
that
had
made
some
impression
on
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
in
the
habit
of
thinking
that
there
was
nothing
wanting
to
be
done
for
him
;
that
it
was
all
settled
and
over
;
in
short
,
of
not
thinking
at
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
different
now
.
<EOS>
Let
me
do
something
for
him
.
<EOS>
You
too
,
"
said
the
visitor
,
with
careful
delicacy
,
"
have
need
to
watch
your
health
closely
,
for
his
sake
,
and
I
fear
it
fails
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Whoever
you
may
be
,
Sir
,
"
answered
Harriet
,
raising
her
eyes
to
his
face
,
"
I
am
deeply
grateful
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
feel
certain
that
in
all
you
say
,
you
have
no
object
in
the
world
but
kindness
to
us
.
<EOS>
But
years
have
passed
since
we
began
this
life
;
and
to
take
from
my
brother
any
part
of
what
has
so
endeared
him
to
me
,
and
so
proved
his
better
resolution
---
any
fragment
of
the
merit
of
his
unassisted
,
obscure
,
and
forgotten
reparation
---
would
be
to
diminish
the
comfort
it
will
be
to
him
and
me
,
when
that
time
comes
to
each
of
us
,
of
which
you
spoke
just
now
.
<EOS>
I
thank
you
better
with
these
tears
than
any
words
.
<EOS>
Believe
it
,
pray
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
gentleman
was
moved
,
and
put
the
hand
she
held
out
,
to
his
lips
,
much
as
a
tender
father
might
kiss
the
hand
of
a
dutiful
child
.
<EOS>
But
more
reverently
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
the
day
should
ever
come
,
"
said
Harriet
,
"
when
he
is
restored
,
in
part
,
to
the
position
he
lost
"
  
"
Restored
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
gentleman
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
that
be
hoped
for
?
<EOS>
In
whose
hands
does
the
power
of
any
restoration
lie
?
<EOS>
It
is
no
mistake
of
mine
,
surely
,
to
suppose
that
his
having
gained
the
priceless
blessing
of
his
life
,
is
one
cause
of
the
animosity
shown
to
him
by
his
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
touch
upon
a
subject
that
is
never
breathed
between
us
;
not
even
between
us
,
"
said
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
forgiveness
,
"
said
the
visitor
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
known
it
.
<EOS>
I
entreat
to
you
to
forget
that
I
have
done
so
,
inadvertently
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
as
I
dare
urge
no
more
---
as
I
am
no
sure
that
I
have
a
right
to
do
so
---
though
Heaven
knows
,
even
that
doubt
may
be
habit
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
rubbing
his
head
,
as
despondently
as
before
,
"
let
me
;
though
a
stranger
,
yet
no
stranger
;
ask
two
favours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
they
?
"
<EOS>
she
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
first
,
that
if
you
should
see
cause
to
change
your
resolution
,
you
will
suffer
me
to
be
as
your
right
hand
.
<EOS>
My
name
shall
then
be
at
your
service
:
it
is
useless
now
,
and
always
insignificant
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Our
choice
of
friends
,
"
she
answered
,
smiling
faintly
,
"
is
not
so
great
,
that
I
need
any
time
for
consideration
.
<EOS>
I
can
promise
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
second
,
that
you
will
allow
me
sometimes
,
say
every
Monday
morning
,
at
nine
o'clock
---
<EOS>
habit
again
---
I
must
be
business
-
like
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
with
a
whimsical
inclination
to
quarrel
with
himself
on
that
head
,
"
in
walking
past
,
to
see
you
at
the
door
or
window
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
ask
to
come
in
,
as
your
brother
will
be
gone
out
at
that
hour
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
ask
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
merely
ask
to
see
,
for
the
satisfaction
of
my
own
mind
,
that
you
are
well
,
and
without
intrusion
to
remind
you
,
by
the
sight
of
me
,
that
you
have
a
friend
---
an
elderly
friend
,
grey
-
haired
already
,
and
fast
growing
greyer
---
whom
you
may
ever
command
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
cordial
face
looked
up
in
his
;
confided
in
it
;
and
promised
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
as
before
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
rising
,
"
that
you
purpose
not
to
mention
my
visit
to
John
Carker
,
lest
he
should
be
at
all
distressed
by
my
acquaintance
with
his
history
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
it
,
for
it
is
out
of
the
ordinary
course
of
things
,
and
---
habit
again
!
"
said
the
gentleman
,
checking
himself
impatiently
,
"
as
if
there
were
no
better
course
than
the
ordinary
course
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
he
turned
to
go
,
and
walking
,
bareheaded
,
to
the
outside
of
the
little
porch
,
took
leave
of
her
with
such
a
happy
mixture
of
unconstrained
respect
and
unaffected
interest
,
as
no
breeding
could
have
taught
,
no
truth
mistrusted
,
and
nothing
but
a
pure
and
single
heart
expressed
.
  
<EOS>
Many
half
-
forgotten
emotions
were
awakened
in
the
sister
's
mind
by
this
visit
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
very
long
since
any
other
visitor
had
crossed
their
threshold
;
it
was
so
very
long
since
any
voice
of
sympathy
had
made
sad
music
in
her
ears
;
that
the
stranger
's
figure
remained
present
to
her
,
hours
afterwards
,
when
she
sat
at
the
window
,
plying
her
needle
;
and
his
words
seemed
newly
spoken
,
again
and
again
.
<EOS>
He
had
touched
the
spring
that
opened
her
whole
life
;
and
if
she
lost
him
for
a
short
space
,
it
was
only
among
the
many
shapes
of
the
one
great
recollection
of
which
that
life
was
made
.
  
<EOS>
Musing
and
working
by
turns
;
now
constraining
herself
to
be
steady
at
her
needle
for
a
long
time
together
,
and
now
letting
her
work
fall
,
unregarded
,
on
her
lap
,
and
straying
wheresoever
her
busier
thoughts
led
,
Harriet
Carker
found
the
hours
glide
by
her
,
and
the
day
steal
on
.
<EOS>
The
morning
,
which
had
been
bright
and
clear
,
gradually
became
overcast
;
a
sharp
wind
set
in
;
the
rain
fell
heavily
;
and
a
dark
mist
drooping
over
the
distant
town
,
hid
it
from
the
view
.
  
<EOS>
She
often
looked
with
compassion
,
at
such
a
time
,
upon
the
stragglers
who
came
wandering
into
London
,
by
the
great
highway
hard
by
,
and
who
,
footsore
and
weary
,
and
gazing
fearfully
at
the
huge
town
before
them
,
as
if
foreboding
that
their
misery
there
would
be
but
as
a
drop
of
water
in
the
sea
,
or
as
a
grain
of
sea
-
sand
on
the
shore
,
went
shrinking
on
,
cowering
before
the
angry
weather
,
and
looking
as
if
the
very
elements
rejected
them
.
<EOS>
Day
after
day
,
such
travellers
crept
past
,
but
always
,
as
she
thought
,
in
one
direction
---
always
towards
the
town
.
<EOS>
Swallowed
up
in
one
phase
or
other
of
its
immensity
,
towards
which
they
seemed
impelled
by
a
desperate
fascination
,
they
never
returned
.
<EOS>
Food
for
the
hospitals
,
the
churchyards
,
the
prisons
,
the
river
,
fever
,
madness
,
vice
,
and
death
,
---
they
passed
on
to
the
monster
,
roaring
in
the
distance
,
and
were
lost
.
  
<EOS>
The
chill
wind
was
howling
,
and
the
rain
was
falling
,
and
the
day
was
darkening
moodily
,
when
Harriet
,
raising
her
eyes
from
the
work
on
which
she
had
long
since
been
engaged
with
unremitting
constancy
,
saw
one
of
these
travellers
approaching
.
  
<EOS>
A
woman
.
<EOS>
A
solitary
woman
of
some
thirty
years
of
age
;
tall
;
well
formed
;
handsome
;
miserably
dressed
;
the
soil
of
many
country
roads
in
varied
weather
---
dust
,
chalk
,
clay
,
gravel
---
clotted
on
her
grey
cloak
by
the
streaming
wet
;
no
bonnet
on
her
head
,
nothing
to
defend
her
rich
black
hair
from
the
rain
,
but
a
torn
handkerchief
;
with
the
fluttering
ends
of
which
,
and
with
her
hair
,
the
wind
blinded
her
so
that
she
often
stopped
to
push
them
back
,
and
look
upon
the
way
she
was
going
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
in
the
act
of
doing
so
,
when
Harriet
observed
her
.
<EOS>
As
her
hands
,
parting
on
her
sunburnt
forehead
,
swept
across
her
face
,
and
threw
aside
the
hindrances
that
encroached
upon
it
,
there
was
a
reckless
and
regardless
beauty
in
it
:
a
dauntless
and
depraved
indifference
to
more
than
weather
:
a
carelessness
of
what
was
cast
upon
her
bare
head
from
Heaven
or
earth
:
that
coupled
with
her
misery
and
loneliness
,
touched
the
heart
of
her
fellow
-
woman
.
<EOS>
She
thought
of
all
that
was
perverted
and
debased
within
her
,
no
less
than
without
:
of
modest
graces
of
the
mind
,
hardened
and
steeled
,
like
these
attractions
of
the
person
:
of
the
many
gifts
of
the
Creator
flung
to
the
winds
like
the
wild
hair
;
of
all
the
beautiful
ruin
upon
which
the
storm
was
beating
and
the
night
was
coming
.
  
<EOS>
Thinking
of
this
,
she
did
not
turn
away
with
a
delicate
indignation
---
too
many
of
her
own
compassionate
and
tender
sex
too
often
do
---
but
pitied
her
.
  
<EOS>
Her
fallen
sister
came
on
,
looking
far
before
her
,
trying
with
her
eager
eyes
to
pierce
the
mist
in
which
the
city
was
enshrouded
,
and
glancing
,
now
and
then
,
from
side
to
side
,
with
the
bewildered
and
uncertain
aspect
of
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
Though
her
tread
was
bold
and
courageous
,
she
was
fatigued
,
and
after
a
moment
of
irresolution
,
sat
down
upon
a
heap
of
stones
;
seeking
no
shelter
from
the
rain
,
but
letting
it
rain
on
her
as
it
would
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
now
opposite
the
house
;
raising
her
head
after
resting
it
for
a
moment
on
both
hands
,
her
eyes
met
those
of
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
moment
,
Harriet
was
at
the
door
:
and
the
other
,
rising
from
her
seat
at
her
beck
,
came
slowly
,
and
with
no
conciliatory
look
,
towards
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
rest
in
the
rain
?
"
said
Harriet
,
gently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
have
no
other
resting
-
place
,
"
was
the
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
are
many
places
of
shelter
near
here
.
<EOS>
This
,
"
referring
to
the
little
porch
,
"
is
better
than
where
you
were
.
<EOS>
You
are
very
welcome
to
rest
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
wanderer
looked
at
her
,
in
doubt
and
surprise
,
but
without
any
expression
of
thankfulness
;
and
sitting
down
,
and
taking
off
one
of
her
worn
shoes
to
beat
out
the
fragments
of
stone
and
dust
that
were
inside
,
showed
that
her
foot
was
cut
and
bleeding
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
uttering
an
expression
of
pity
,
the
traveller
looked
up
with
a
contemptuous
and
incredulous
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
's
a
torn
foot
to
such
as
me
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
what
's
a
torn
foot
in
such
as
me
,
to
such
as
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
and
wash
it
,
"
answered
Harriet
,
mildly
,
"
and
let
me
give
you
something
to
bind
it
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
woman
caught
her
arm
,
and
drawing
it
before
her
own
eyes
,
hid
them
against
it
,
and
wept
.
<EOS>
Not
like
a
woman
,
but
like
a
stern
man
surprised
into
that
weakness
;
with
a
violent
heaving
of
her
breast
,
and
struggle
for
recovery
,
that
showed
how
unusual
the
emotion
was
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
submitted
to
be
led
into
the
house
,
and
,
evidently
more
in
gratitude
than
in
any
care
for
herself
,
washed
and
bound
the
injured
place
.
<EOS>
Harriet
then
put
before
her
fragments
of
her
own
frugal
dinner
,
and
when
she
had
eaten
of
them
,
though
sparingly
,
besought
her
,
before
resuming
her
road
(
which
she
showed
her
anxiety
to
do
)
,
to
dry
her
clothes
before
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Again
,
more
in
gratitude
than
with
any
evidence
of
concern
in
her
own
behalf
,
she
sat
down
in
front
of
it
,
and
unbinding
the
handkerchief
about
her
head
,
and
letting
her
thick
wet
hair
fall
down
below
her
waist
,
sat
drying
it
with
the
palms
of
her
hands
,
and
looking
at
the
blaze
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
are
thinking
"
she
said
,
lifting
her
head
suddenly
,
"
that
I
used
to
be
handsome
,
once
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
was
---
<EOS>
I
know
I
was
.
<EOS>
Look
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
held
up
her
hair
roughly
with
both
hands
;
seizing
it
as
if
she
would
have
torn
it
out
;
then
,
threw
it
down
again
,
and
flung
it
back
as
though
it
were
a
heap
of
serpents
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
a
stranger
in
this
place
?
"
asked
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
stranger
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
returned
,
stopping
between
each
short
reply
,
and
looking
at
the
fire
.
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Ten
or
a
dozen
years
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
no
almanack
where
I
have
been
.
<EOS>
Ten
or
a
dozen
years
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
this
part
.
<EOS>
It
's
much
altered
since
I
went
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
been
far
?
"
  
"
Very
far
.
<EOS>
Months
upon
months
over
the
sea
,
and
far
away
even
then
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
where
convicts
go
,
"
she
added
looking
full
upon
her
entertainer
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
one
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Heaven
help
you
and
forgive
you
!
"
<EOS>
was
the
gentle
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Heaven
help
me
and
forgive
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
returned
,
nodding
her
head
at
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
If
man
would
help
some
of
us
a
little
more
,
God
would
forgive
us
all
the
sooner
perhaps
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
she
was
softened
by
the
earnest
manner
,
and
the
cordial
face
so
full
of
mildness
and
so
free
from
judgment
,
of
her
,
and
said
,
less
hardily
:
  
<EOS>
"
We
may
be
about
the
same
age
,
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
older
,
it
is
not
above
a
year
or
two
.
<EOS>
Oh
think
of
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
opened
her
arms
,
as
though
the
exhibition
of
her
outward
form
would
show
the
moral
wretch
she
was
;
and
letting
them
drop
at
her
sides
,
hung
down
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
we
may
not
hope
to
repair
;
it
is
never
too
late
to
amend
,
"
said
Harriet
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
penitent
---
"
  
"
No
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
be
.
<EOS>
I
am
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
Why
should
Ibe
penitent
,
and
all
the
world
go
free
?
<EOS>
They
talk
to
me
of
my
penitence
.
<EOS>
Who
's
penitent
for
the
wrongs
that
have
been
done
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
rose
up
,
bound
her
handkerchief
about
her
head
,
and
turned
to
move
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
?
"
said
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yonder
,
"
she
answered
,
pointing
with
her
hand
.
"
<EOS>
To
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
any
home
to
go
to
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
a
mother
.
<EOS>
She
's
as
much
a
mother
,
as
her
dwelling
is
a
home
,
"
she
answered
with
a
bitter
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
this
,
"
cried
Harriet
,
putting
money
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Try
to
do
well
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
little
,
but
for
one
day
it
may
keep
you
from
harm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
married
?
"
said
the
other
,
faintly
,
as
she
took
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
live
here
with
my
brother
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
much
to
spare
,
or
I
would
give
you
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
let
me
kiss
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Seeing
no
scorn
or
repugnance
in
her
face
,
the
object
of
her
charity
bent
over
her
as
she
asked
the
question
,
and
pressed
her
lips
against
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
Once
more
she
caught
her
arm
,
and
covered
her
eyes
with
it
;
and
then
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
Gone
into
the
deepening
night
,
and
howling
wind
,
and
pelting
rain
;
urging
her
way
on
towards
the
mist
-
enshrouded
city
where
the
blurred
lights
gleamed
;
and
with
her
black
hair
,
and
disordered
head
-
gear
,
fluttering
round
her
reckless
face
.

Chapter

<EOS>
Another
Mother
and
Daughter
 
IN
an
ugly
and
dark
room
,
an
old
woman
,
ugly
and
dark
too
,
sat
listening
to
the
wind
and
rain
,
and
crouching
over
a
meagre
fire
.
<EOS>
More
constant
to
the
last
-
named
occupation
than
the
first
,
she
never
changed
her
attitude
,
unless
,
when
any
stray
drops
of
rain
fell
hissing
on
the
smouldering
embers
,
to
raise
her
head
with
an
awakened
attention
to
the
whistling
and
pattering
outside
,
and
gradually
to
let
it
fall
again
lower
and
lower
and
lower
as
she
sunk
into
a
brooding
state
of
thought
,
in
which
the
noises
of
the
night
were
as
indistinctly
regarded
as
is
the
monotonous
rolling
of
a
sea
by
one
who
sits
in
contemplation
on
its
shore
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
light
in
the
room
<EOS>
save
that
which
the
fire
afforded
.
<EOS>
Glaring
sullenly
from
time
to
time
like
the
eye
of
a
fierce
beast
half
asleep
,
it
revealed
no
objects
that
needed
to
be
jealous
of
a
better
display
.
<EOS>
A
heap
of
rags
,
a
heap
of
bones
,
a
wretched
bed
,
two
or
three
mutilated
chairs
or
stools
,
the
black
walls
and
blacker
ceiling
,
were
all
its
winking
brightness
shone
upon
.
<EOS>
As
the
old
woman
,
with
a
gigantic
and
distorted
image
of
herself
thrown
half
upon
the
wall
behind
her
,
half
upon
the
roof
above
,
sat
bending
over
the
few
loose
bricks
within
which
it
was
pent
,
on
the
damp
hearth
of
the
chimney
---
<EOS>
for
there
was
no
stove
<EOS>
---
she
looked
as
if
she
were
watching
at
some
witch
's
altar
for
a
favourable
token
;
and
but
that
the
movement
of
her
chattering
jaws
and
trembling
chin
was
too
frequent
and
too
fast
for
the
slow
flickering
of
the
fire
,
it
would
have
seemed
an
illusion
wrought
by
the
light
,
as
it
came
and
went
,
upon
a
face
as
motionless
as
the
form
to
which
it
belonged
.
  
<EOS>
If
Florence
could
have
stood
within
the
room
and
looked
upon
the
original
of
the
shadow
thrown
upon
the
wall
and
roof
,
as
it
cowered
thus
over
the
fire
,
a
glance
might
have
sufficed
to
recall
the
figure
of
Good
Mrs
Brown
;
notwithstanding
that
her
childish
recollection
of
that
terrible
old
woman
was
as
grotesque
and
exaggerated
a
presentment
of
the
truth
,
perhaps
,
as
the
shadow
on
the
wall
.
<EOS>
But
Florence
was
not
there
to
look
on
;
and
Good
Mrs
Brown
remained
unrecognised
,
and
sat
staring
at
her
fire
,
unobserved
.
  
<EOS>
Attracted
by
a
louder
sputtering
than
usual
,
as
the
rain
came
hissing
down
the
chimney
in
a
little
stream
,
the
old
woman
raised
her
head
,
impatiently
,
to
listen
afresh
.
<EOS>
And
this
time
she
did
not
drop
it
again
;
for
there
was
a
hand
upon
the
door
,
and
a
footstep
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
looking
over
her
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
who
brings
you
news
,
"
was
the
answer
,
in
a
woman
's
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
News
?
<EOS>
Where
from
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
From
abroad
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
From
beyond
seas
?
"
cried
the
old
woman
,
starting
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
from
beyond
seas
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
raked
the
fire
together
,
hurriedly
,
and
going
close
to
her
visitor
who
had
entered
,
and
shut
the
door
,
and
who
now
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
put
her
hand
upon
the
drenched
cloak
,
and
turned
the
unresisting
figure
,
so
as
to
have
it
in
the
full
light
of
the
fire
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
find
what
she
had
expected
,
whatever
that
might
be
;
for
she
let
the
cloak
go
again
,
and
uttered
a
querulous
cry
of
disappointment
and
misery
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
asked
her
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oho
!
Oho
!
"
cried
old
woman
,
turning
her
face
upward
,
with
a
terrible
howl
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
asked
the
visitor
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
my
gal
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
old
woman
,
tossing
up
her
arms
,
and
clasping
her
hands
above
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
's
my
Alice
?
<EOS>
Where
's
my
handsome
daughter
?
<EOS>
They
've
been
the
death
of
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
've
not
been
the
death
of
her
yet
,
if
your
name
's
Marwood
,
"
said
the
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
seen
my
gal
,
then
?
"
cried
the
old
woman
.
"
<EOS>
Has
she
wrote
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
said
you
could
n't
read
,
"
returned
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
more
I
can
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
old
woman
,
wringing
her
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
no
light
here
?
"
said
the
other
,
looking
round
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
,
mumbling
and
shaking
her
head
,
and
muttering
to
herself
about
her
handsome
daughter
,
brought
a
candle
from
a
cupboard
in
the
corner
,
and
thrusting
it
into
the
fire
with
a
trembling
hand
,
lighted
it
with
some
difficulty
and
set
it
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
Its
dirty
wick
burnt
dimly
at
first
,
being
choked
in
its
own
grease
;
and
when
the
bleared
eyes
and
failing
sight
of
the
old
woman
could
distinguish
anything
by
its
light
,
her
visitor
was
sitting
with
her
arms
folded
,
her
eyes
turned
downwards
,
and
a
handkerchief
she
had
worn
upon
her
head
lying
on
the
table
by
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
sent
to
me
by
word
of
mouth
then
,
my
gal
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
"
mumbled
the
old
woman
,
after
waiting
for
some
moments
.
<EOS>
"
What
did
she
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Look
,
"
returned
the
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
repeated
the
word
in
a
scared
uncertain
way
;
and
,
shading
her
eyes
,
looked
at
the
speaker
,
round
the
room
,
and
at
the
speaker
once
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
said
look
again
,
mother
;
"
and
the
speaker
fixed
her
eyes
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
Again
the
old
woman
looked
round
the
room
,
and
at
her
visitor
,
and
round
the
room
once
more
.
<EOS>
Hastily
seizing
the
candle
,
and
rising
from
her
seat
,
she
held
it
to
the
visitor
's
face
,
uttered
a
loud
cry
,
set
down
the
light
,
and
fell
upon
her
neck
!
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
gal
!
<EOS>
It
's
my
Alice
!
<EOS>
It
's
my
handsome
daughter
,
living
an
come
back
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
the
old
woman
,
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
upon
the
breast
that
coldly
suffered
her
embrace
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
gal
!
<EOS>
It
's
my
Alice
!
<EOS>
It
's
my
handsome
daughter
,
living
and
come
back
!
"
<EOS>
she
screamed
again
,
dropping
on
the
floor
before
her
,
clasping
her
knees
,
laying
her
head
against
them
,
and
still
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
with
every
frantic
demonstration
of
which
her
vitality
was
capable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
mother
,
"
returned
Alice
,
stooping
forward
for
a
moment
and
kissing
her
,
but
endeavouring
,
even
in
the
act
,
to
disengage
herself
from
her
embrace
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
here
,
at
last
.
<EOS>
Let
go
,
mother
;
let
go
.
<EOS>
Get
up
,
and
sit
in
your
chair
.
<EOS>
What
good
does
this
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
come
back
harder
than
she
went
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
mother
,
looking
up
in
her
face
,
and
still
holding
to
her
knees
.
<EOS>
"
She
do
n't
care
for
me
!
<EOS>
after
all
these
years
,
and
all
the
wretched
life
I
've
led
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
mother
!
"
said
Alice
,
shaking
her
ragged
skirts
to
detach
the
old
woman
from
them
:
"
there
are
two
sides
to
that
.
<EOS>
There
have
been
years
for
me
as
well
as
you
,
and
there
has
been
wretchedness
for
me
as
well
as
you
.
<EOS>
Get
up
,
get
up
!
"
  
<EOS>
Her
mother
rose
,
and
cried
,
and
wrung
her
hands
,
and
stood
at
a
little
distance
gazing
on
her
.
<EOS>
Then
she
took
the
candle
again
,
and
going
round
her
,
surveyed
her
from
head
to
foot
,
making
a
low
moaning
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
Then
she
put
the
candle
down
,
resumed
her
chair
,
and
beating
her
hands
together
to
a
kind
of
weary
tune
,
and
rolling
herself
from
side
to
side
,
continued
moaning
and
wailing
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
got
up
,
took
off
her
wet
cloak
,
and
laid
it
aside
.
<EOS>
That
done
,
she
sat
down
as
before
,
and
with
her
arms
folded
,
and
her
eyes
gazing
at
the
fire
,
remained
silently
listening
with
a
contemptuous
face
to
her
old
mother
's
inarticulate
complainings
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
expect
to
see
me
return
as
youthful
as
I
went
away
,
mother
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
at
length
,
turning
her
eyes
upon
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
think
a
foreign
life
,
like
mine
,
was
good
for
good
looks
?
<EOS>
One
would
believe
so
,
to
hear
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
an't
that
!
"
cried
the
mother
.
<EOS>
"
She
knows
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
then
?
"
returned
the
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
It
had
best
be
something
that
do
n't
last
,
mother
,
or
my
way
out
<EOS>
is
easier
than
my
way
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hear
that
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
mother
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
all
these
years
she
threatens
to
desert
me
in
the
moment
of
her
coming
back
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
mother
,
for
the
second
time
,
there
have
been
years
for
me
as
well
as
you
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
Come
back
harder
?
<EOS>
Of
course
I
have
come
back
harder
.
<EOS>
What
else
did
you
expect
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Harder
to
me
!
<EOS>
To
her
own
dear
mother
!
"
cried
the
old
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
who
began
to
harden
me
,
if
my
own
dear
mother
did
n't
,
"
she
returned
,
sitting
with
her
folded
arms
,
and
knitted
brows
,
and
compressed
lips
as
if
she
were
bent
on
excluding
,
by
force
,
every
softer
feeling
from
her
breast
.
"
<EOS>
Listen
,
mother
,
to
a
word
or
two
.
<EOS>
If
we
understand
each
other
now
,
we
shall
not
fall
out
any
more
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
I
went
away
a
girl
,
and
have
come
back
a
woman
.
<EOS>
I
went
away
undutiful
enough
,
and
have
come
back
not
better
,
you
may
swear
.
<EOS>
But
have
you
been
very
dutiful
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
!
"
cried
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
my
gal
!
<EOS>
A
mother
dutiful
to
her
own
child
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
sounds
unnatural
,
do
n't
it
?
"
returned
the
daughter
,
looking
coldly
on
her
with
her
stern
,
regardless
,
hardy
,
beautiful
face
;
"
but
I
have
thought
of
it
sometimes
,
in
the
course
of
my
lone
years
,
till
I
have
got
used
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
some
talk
about
duty
first
and
last
;
but
it
has
always
been
of
my
duty
to
other
people
.
<EOS>
I
have
wondered
now
and
then
---
to
pass
away
the
time
---
whether
no
one
ever
owed
any
duty
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
mother
sat
mowing
,
and
mumbling
,
and
shaking
her
head
,
but
whether
angrily
or
remorsefully
,
or
in
denial
,
or
only
in
her
physical
infirmity
,
did
not
appear
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
child
called
Alice
Marwood
,
"
said
the
daughter
,
with
a
laugh
,
and
looking
down
at
herself
in
terrible
derision
of
herself
,
"
born
,
among
poverty
and
neglect
,
and
nursed
in
it
.
<EOS>
Nobody
taught
her
,
nobody
stepped
forward
to
help
her
,
nobody
cared
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
!
"
echoed
the
mother
,
pointing
to
herself
,
and
striking
her
breast
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
only
care
she
knew
,
"
returned
the
daughter
,
"
was
to
be
beaten
,
and
stinted
,
and
abused
sometimes
;
and
she
might
have
done
better
without
that
.
<EOS>
She
lived
in
homes
like
this
,
and
in
the
streets
,
with
a
crowd
of
little
wretches
like
herself
;
and
yet
she
brought
good
looks
out
of
this
childhood
.
<EOS>
So
much
the
worse
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
better
have
been
hunted
and
worried
to
death
for
ugliness
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
on
!
<EOS>
go
on
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
on
,
"
returned
the
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
girl
called
Alice
Marwood
.
<EOS>
She
was
handsome
.
<EOS>
She
was
taught
too
late
,
and
taught
all
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
was
too
well
cared
for
,
too
well
trained
,
too
well
helped
on
,
too
much
looked
after
.
<EOS>
You
were
very
fond
of
her
---
you
were
better
off
then
.
<EOS>
What
came
to
that
girl
comes
to
thousands
every
year
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
ruin
,
and
she
was
born
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
After
all
these
years
!
"
whined
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
My
gal
begins
with
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
'll
soon
have
ended
,
"
said
the
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
criminal
called
Alice
Marwood
---
a
girl
still
,
but
deserted
and
an
outcast
.
<EOS>
And
she
was
tried
,
and
she
was
sentenced
.
<EOS>
And
lord
,
how
the
gentlemen
in
the
Court
talked
about
it
!
<EOS>
and
how
grave
the
judge
was
on
her
duty
,
and
on
her
having
perverted
the
gifts
of
nature
---
as
if
he
did
n't
know
better
than
anybody
there
,
that
they
had
been
made
curses
to
her
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
how
he
preached
about
the
strong
arm
of
the
Law
---
<EOS>
so
very
strong
to
save
her
,
when
she
was
an
innocent
and
helpless
little
wretch
;
and
how
solemn
and
religious
it
all
was
.
<EOS>
I
have
thought
of
that
,
many
times
since
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
folded
her
arms
tightly
on
her
breast
,
and
laughed
in
a
tone
that
made
the
howl
of
the
old
woman
musical
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
Alice
Marwood
was
transported
,
mother
,
"
she
pursued
,
"
and
was
sent
to
learn
her
duty
,
where
there
was
twenty
times
less
duty
,
and
more
wickedness
,
and
wrong
,
and
infamy
,
than
here
.
<EOS>
And
Alice
Marwood
is
come
back
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Such
a
woman
as
she
ought
to
be
,
after
all
this
.
<EOS>
In
good
time
,
there
will
be
more
solemnity
,
and
more
fine
talk
,
and
more
strong
arm
,
most
likely
,
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
her
;
but
the
gentlemen
need
n't
be
afraid
of
being
thrown
out
of
work
.
<EOS>
There
's
crowds
of
little
wretches
,
boy
and
girl
,
growing
up
in
any
of
the
streets
they
live
in
,
that
'll
keep
them
to
till
they
've
made
their
fortunes
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
leaned
her
elbows
on
the
table
,
and
resting
her
face
upon
her
two
hands
,
made
a
show
of
being
in
great
distress
---
or
really
was
,
perhaps
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
I
have
done
,
mother
,
"
said
the
daughter
,
with
a
motion
of
her
head
,
as
if
in
dismissal
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
enough
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
you
and
I
talk
of
being
dutiful
,
whatever
we
do
.
<EOS>
Your
childhood
was
like
mine
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
So
much
the
worse
for
both
of
us
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
blame
you
,
or
to
defend
myself
;
why
should
I
?
<EOS>
That
's
all
over
long
ago
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
a
woman
---
not
a
girl
,
now
---
and
you
and
I
need
n't
make
a
show
of
our
history
,
like
the
gentlemen
in
the
Court
.
<EOS>
We
know
all
about
it
well
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lost
and
degraded
as
she
was
,
there
was
a
beauty
in
her
,
both
of
face
and
form
,
which
,
even
in
its
worst
expression
,
could
not
but
be
recognised
as
such
by
any
one
regarding
her
with
the
least
attention
.
<EOS>
As
she
subsided
into
silence
,
and
her
face
which
had
been
harshly
agitated
,
quieted
down
;
while
her
dark
eyes
,
fixed
upon
the
fire
,
exchanged
the
reckless
light
that
had
animated
them
,
for
one
that
was
softened
by
something
like
sorrow
;
there
shone
through
all
her
wayworn
misery
and
fatigue
,
a
ray
of
the
departed
radiance
of
the
fallen
angel
.
  
<EOS>
Her
mother
,
after
watching
her
for
some
time
without
speaking
,
ventured
to
steal
her
withered
hand
a
little
nearer
to
her
across
the
table
;
and
finding
that
she
permitted
this
,
to
touch
her
face
and
smooth
her
hair
.
<EOS>
With
the
feeling
as
it
seemed
,
that
the
old
woman
was
at
least
sincere
in
this
show
of
interest
,
Alice
made
no
movement
to
check
her
;
so
,
advancing
by
degrees
,
she
bound
up
her
daughter
's
hair
afresh
,
took
off
her
wet
shoes
,
if
they
deserved
the
name
,
spread
something
dry
upon
her
shoulders
,
and
hovered
humbly
about
her
,
muttering
to
herself
,
as
she
recognised
her
old
features
and
expression
more
and
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
poor
,
mother
,
I
see
,
"
said
Alice
,
looking
round
,
when
she
had
sat
thus
for
some
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bitter
poor
,
my
deary
,
"
replied
the
old
woman
.
  
<EOS>
She
admired
her
daughter
,
and
was
afraid
of
her
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
her
admiration
,
such
as
it
was
,
had
originated
long
ago
,
when
she
first
found
anything
that
was
beautiful
appearing
in
the
midst
of
the
squalid
fight
of
her
existence
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
her
fear
was
referable
,
in
some
sort
,
to
the
retrospect
she
had
so
lately
heard
.
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
might
,
she
stood
,
submissively
and
deferentially
,
before
her
child
,
and
inclined
her
head
,
as
if
in
a
pitiful
entreaty
to
be
spared
any
further
reproach
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
have
you
lived
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
begging
,
my
deary
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
pilfering
,
mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sometimes
,
Ally
---
in
a
very
small
way
.
<EOS>
I
am
old
and
timid
.
<EOS>
I
have
taken
trifles
from
children
now
and
then
,
my
deary
,
but
not
often
.
<EOS>
I
have
tramped
about
the
country
,
pet
,
and
I
know
what
I
know
.
<EOS>
I
have
watched
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Watched
?
"
returned
the
daughter
,
looking
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hung
about
a
family
,
my
deary
,
"
said
the
mother
,
even
more
humbly
and
submissively
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
family
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
darling
,
Do
n't
be
angry
with
me
,
I
did
it
for
the
love
of
you
.
<EOS>
In
memory
of
my
poor
gal
beyond
seas
.
<EOS>
"
She
put
out
her
hand
deprecatingly
,
and
drawing
it
back
again
,
laid
it
on
her
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
Years
ago
,
my
deary
,
"
she
pursued
,
glancing
timidly
at
the
attentive
and
stern
face
opposed
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
came
across
his
little
child
,
by
chance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whose
child
?
"
  
"
Not
his
,
Alice
deary
;
do
n't
look
at
me
like
that
;
not
his
.
<EOS>
How
could
it
be
his
?
<EOS>
You
know
he
has
none
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whose
then
?
"
returned
the
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
You
said
his
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
Ally
;
you
frighten
me
,
deary
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
---
only
Mr
Dombey
's
.
<EOS>
Since
then
,
darling
,
I
have
seen
them
often
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
uttering
his
last
word
,
the
old
woman
shrunk
and
recoiled
,
as
if
with
a
sudden
fear
that
her
daughter
would
strike
her
.
<EOS>
But
though
the
daughter
's
face
was
fixed
upon
her
,
and
expressed
the
most
vehement
passion
,
she
remained
still
:
except
that
she
clenched
her
arms
tighter
and
tighter
within
each
other
,
on
her
bosom
,
as
if
to
restrain
them
by
that
means
from
doing
an
injury
to
herself
,
or
some
one
else
,
in
the
blind
fury
of
the
wrath
that
suddenly
possessed
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Little
he
thought
who
I
was
!
"
said
the
old
woman
,
shaking
her
clenched
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
little
he
cared
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
her
daughter
,
between
her
teeth
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
we
were
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
"
face
to
face
.
<EOS>
I
spoke
to
him
,
and
he
spoke
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
sat
and
watched
him
as
he
went
away
down
a
long
grove
of
trees
:
and
at
every
step
he
took
<EOS>
,
I
cursed
him
soul
and
body
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
will
thrive
in
spite
of
that
,
"
returned
the
daughter
disdainfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
he
is
thriving
,
"
said
the
mother
.
  
<EOS>
She
held
her
peace
;
for
the
face
and
form
before
her
were
unshaped
by
range
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
the
bosom
would
burst
with
the
emotions
that
strove
within
it
.
<EOS>
The
effort
that
constrained
and
held
it
pent
up
,
was
no
less
formidable
than
the
rage
itself
:
no
less
bespeaking
the
violent
and
dangerous
character
of
the
woman
who
made
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
succeeded
,
and
she
asked
,
after
a
silence
:
  
"
Is
he
married
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
deary
,
"
said
the
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Going
to
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
know
of
,
deary
.
<EOS>
But
his
master
and
friend
is
married
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
we
may
give
him
joy
!
<EOS>
We
may
give
'em
all
joy
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
old
woman
,
hugging
herself
with
her
lean
arms
in
her
exultation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nothing
but
joy
to
us
will
come
of
that
marriage
.
<EOS>
Mind
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
daughter
looked
at
her
for
an
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
wet
and
tired
:
hungry
and
thirsty
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
hobbling
to
the
cupboard
;
"
and
there
's
little
here
,
and
little

---
diving
down
into
her
pocket
,
and
jingling
a
few
half
-
pence
on
the
table
---
"
little
here
.
<EOS>
Have
you
any
money
,
Alice
,
deary
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
covetous
,
sharp
,
eager
face
with
which
she
asked
the
question
and
looked
on
,
as
her
daughter
took
out
of
her
bosom
the
little
gift
she
had
so
lately
received
,
told
almost
as
much
of
the
history
of
this
parent
and
child
as
the
child
herself
had
told
in
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
said
the
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
this
,
but
for
charity
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
for
charity
,
eh
,
deary
?
"
said
the
old
woman
,
bending
greedily
over
the
table
to
look
at
the
money
,
which
she
appeared
distrustful
of
her
daughter
's
still
retaining
in
her
hand
,
and
gazing
on
.
"
<EOS>
Humph
!
<EOS>
six
and
six
is
twelve
,
and
six
eighteen
 
<EOS>
---
so
---
we
must
take
the
most
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
buy
something
to
eat
and
drink
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
greater
alacrity
than
might
have
been
expected
in
one
of
her
appearance
---
for
age
and
misery
seemed
to
have
made
her
as
decrepit
as
ugly
---
she
began
to
occupy
her
trembling
hands
in
tying
an
old
bonnet
on
her
head
,
and
folding
a
torn
shawl
about
herself
:
still
eyeing
the
money
in
her
daughter
's
hand
,
with
the
same
sharp
desire
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
joy
is
to
come
to
us
of
this
marriage
,
mother
?
"
asked
the
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
told
me
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
joy
,
"
she
replied
,
attiring
herself
,
with
fumbling
fingers
,
"
of
no
love
at
all
,
and
much
pride
and
hate
,
my
deary
.
<EOS>
The
joy
of
confusion
and
strife
among
'em
,
proud
as
they
are
,
and
of
daughter
-
danger
,
Alice
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
danger
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
what
I
have
seen
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
know
!
"
chuckled
the
mother
.
<EOS>
"
Let
some
look
to
it
.
<EOS>
Let
some
be
upon
their
guard
.
<EOS>
My
gal
may
keep
good
company
yet
!
"
  
<EOS>
Then
,
seeing
that
in
the
wondering
earnestness
with
which
her
daughter
regarded
her
,
her
hand
involuntarily
closed
upon
the
money
,
the
old
woman
made
more
speed
to
secure
it
,
and
hurriedly
added
,
"
but
I
'll
go
buy
something
;
I
'll
go
buy
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
stood
with
her
hand
stretched
out
before
her
daughter
,
her
daughter
,
glancing
again
at
the
money
,
put
it
to
her
lips
before
parting
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
Ally
!
<EOS>
Do
you
kiss
it
?
<EOS>
"
chuckled
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
like
me
---
I
often
do
,
<EOS>
Oh
,
it
's
so
good
to
us
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
squeezing
her
own
tarnished
halfpence
up
to
her
bag
of
a
throat
,
"
so
good
to
us
in
everything
but
not
coming
in
heaps
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
kiss
it
,
mother
,
"
said
the
daughter
,
"
or
<EOS>
I
did
then
<EOS>
---
I
do
n't
know
that
I
ever
did
before

for
the
giver
's
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
giver
,
eh
,
deary
?
<EOS>
"
retorted
the
old
woman
,
whose
dimmed
eyes
glistened
as
she
took
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Aye
!
<EOS>
I
'll
kiss
it
for
the
giver
's
sake
,
too
,
when
the
giver
can
make
it
go
farther
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
go
spend
it
,
deary
.
<EOS>
I
'll
be
back
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
say
you
know
a
great
deal
,
mother
,
"
said
the
daughter
,
following
her
to
the
door
with
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
grown
very
wise
since
we
parted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Know
!
"
croaked
the
old
woman
,
coming
back
a
step
or
two
,
"
I
know
more
than
you
think
.
<EOS>
I
know
more
than
he
thinks
,
deary
,
as
I
'll
tell
you
by
and
bye
.
<EOS>
I
know
all
about
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
daughter
smiled
incredulously
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
of
his
brother
,
Alice
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
stretching
out
her
neck
with
a
leer
of
malice
absolutely
frightful
,
"
who
might
have
been
where
you
have
been
---
for
stealing
money
---
and
who
lives
with
his
sister
,
over
yonder
,
by
the
north
road
out
of
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
  
"
By
the
north
road
out
of
London
,
deary

<EOS>
You
shall
see
the
house
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
It
an't
much
to
boast
of
,
genteel
as
his
own
is
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
cried
the
old
woman
,
shaking
her
head
and
laughing
;
for
her
daughter
had
started
up
,
"
not
now
;
it
's
too
far
off
;
it
's
by
the
milestone
,
where
the
stones
are
heaped
;
---
to
-
morrow
,
deary
,
if
it
's
fine
,
and
you
are
in
the
humour
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
go
spend
---
"
  
"
Stop
!
"
and
the
daughter
flung
herself
upon
her
,
with
her
former
passion
raging
like
a
fire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
sister
is
a
fair
-
faced
Devil
,
with
brown
hair
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
,
amazed
and
terrified
,
nodded
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
the
shadow
of
him
in
her
face
!
<EOS>
It
's
a
red
house
standing
by
itself
.
<EOS>
Before
the
door
there
is
a
small
green
porch
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
the
old
woman
nodded
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
which
I
sat
to
-
day
!
<EOS>
Give
me
back
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
!
<EOS>
Deary
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
back
the
money
,
or
you
'll
be
hurt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
forced
it
from
the
old
woman
's
hand
as
she
spoke
,
and
utterly
indifferent
to
her
complainings
and
entreaties
,
threw
on
the
garments
she
had
taken
of
,
and
hurried
out
,
with
headlong
speed
.
  
<EOS>
The
mother
followed
,
limping
after
her
as
she
could
,
and
expostulating
with
no
more
effect
upon
her
than
upon
the
wind
and
rain
and
darkness
that
encompassed
them
.
<EOS>
Obdurate
and
fierce
in
her
own
purpose
,
and
indifferent
to
all
besides
,
the
daughter
defied
the
weather
and
the
distance
,
as
if
she
had
known
no
travel
or
fatigue
,
and
made
for
the
house
where
she
had
been
relieved
.
<EOS>
After
some
quarter
of
an
hour
's
walking
,
the
old
woman
,
spent
and
out
of
breath
,
ventured
to
hold
by
her
skirts
;
but
she
ventured
no
more
,
and
they
travelled
on
in
silence
through
the
wet
and
gloom
.
<EOS>
If
the
mother
now
and
then
uttered
a
word
of
complaint
,
she
stifled
it
lest
her
daughter
should
break
away
from
her
and
leave
her
behind
;
and
the
daughter
was
dumb
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
within
an
hour
or
so
of
midnight
,
when
they
left
the
regular
streets
behind
them
,
and
entered
on
the
deeper
gloom
of
that
neutral
ground
where
the
house
was
situated
.
<EOS>
The
town
lay
in
the
distance
,
lurid
and
lowering
;
the
bleak
wind
howled
over
the
open
space
;
all
around
was
black
,
wild
,
desolate
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
fit
place
for
me
!
"
said
the
daughter
,
stopping
to
look
back
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
so
,
when
I
was
here
before
,
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Alice
,
my
deary
,
"
cried
the
mother
,
pulling
her
gently
by
the
skirt
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
now
,
mother
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
give
the
money
back
,
my
darling
;
please
do
n't
.
<EOS>
We
ca
n't
afford
it
.
<EOS>
We
want
supper
,
deary
.
<EOS>
Money
is
money
,
whoever
gives
it
.
<EOS>
Say
what
you
will
,
but
keep
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
See
there
!
"
<EOS>
was
all
the
daughter
's
answer
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
house
I
mean
.
<EOS>
Is
that
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
nodded
in
the
affirmative
;
and
a
few
more
paces
brought
them
to
the
threshold
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
light
of
fire
and
candle
in
the
room
where
Alice
had
sat
to
dry
her
clothes
;
and
on
her
knocking
at
the
door
,
John
Carker
appeared
from
that
room
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
surprised
to
see
such
visitors
at
such
an
hour
,
and
asked
Alice
what
she
wanted
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
your
sister
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
woman
who
gave
me
money
to
-
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
the
sound
of
her
raised
voice
,
Harriet
came
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
here
!
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
answered
,
wondering
.
  
<EOS>
The
face
that
had
humbled
itself
before
her
,
looked
on
her
now
with
such
invincible
hatred
and
defiance
;
and
the
hand
that
had
gently
touched
her
arm
,
was
clenched
with
such
a
show
of
evil
purpose
,
as
if
it
would
gladly
strangle
her
;
that
she
drew
close
to
her
brother
for
protection
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
could
speak
with
you
,
and
not
know
you
!
<EOS>
That
I
could
come
near
you
,
and
not
feel
what
blood
was
running
in
your
veins
,
by
the
tingling
of
my
own
!
"
<EOS>
said
Alice
,
with
a
menacing
gesture
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
What
have
I
done
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Done
!
"
returned
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
sat
me
by
your
fire
;
you
have
given
me
food
and
money
;
you
have
bestowed
your
compassion
on
me
!
<EOS>
You
!
<EOS>
whose
name
I
spit
upon
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
,
with
a
malevolence
that
made
her
ugliness
quite
awful
,
shook
her
withered
hand
at
the
brother
and
sister
in
confirmation
of
her
daughter
,
but
plucked
her
by
the
skirts
again
,
nevertheless
,
imploring
her
to
keep
the
money
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
dropped
a
tear
upon
your
hand
,
may
it
wither
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
up!If
<EOS>
I
spoke
a
gentle
word
in
your
hearing
<EOS>
,
may
it
deafen
you!If
<EOS>
I
touched
you
with
my
lips
,
may
the
touch
be
poison
to
you!A
curse
upon
this
roof
that
gave
me
shelter
!
<EOS>
Sorrow
and
shame
upon
your
head
!
<EOS>
Ruin
upon
all
belonging
to
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
said
the
words
,
she
threw
the
money
down
upon
the
ground
,
and
spurned
it
with
her
foot
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tread
it
in
the
dust
:
I
would
n't
take
it
if
it
paved
my
way
to
Heaven
!
<EOS>
I
would
the
bleeding
foot
that
brought
me
here
to
-
day
,
had
rotted
off
,
before
it
led
me
to
your
house
!
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
,
pale
and
trembling
,
restrained
her
brother
,
and
suffered
her
to
go
on
uninterrupted
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
well
that
I
should
be
pitied
and
forgiven
by
you
,
or
any
one
of
your
name
,
in
the
first
hour
of
my
return
!
<EOS>
It
was
well
that
you
should
act
the
kind
good
lady
to
me
!
<EOS>
I
'll
thank
you
when
I
die
;
I
'll
pray
for
you
,
and
all
your
race
,
you
may
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
fierce
action
of
her
hand
,
as
if
she
sprinkled
hatred
on
the
ground
,
and
with
it
devoted
those
who
were
standing
there
to
destruction
,
she
looked
up
once
at
the
black
sky
,
and
strode
out
into
the
wild
night
.
  
<EOS>
The
mother
,
who
had
plucked
at
her
skirts
again
and
again
in
vain
,
and
had
eyed
the
money
lying
on
the
threshold
with
an
absorbing
greed
that
seemed
to
concentrate
her
faculties
upon
it
,
would
have
prowled
about
,
until
the
house
was
dark
,
and
then
groped
in
the
mire
on
the
chance
of
repossessing
herself
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
daughter
drew
her
away
,
and
they
set
forth
,
straight
,
on
their
return
to
their
dwelling
;
the
old
woman
whimpering
and
bemoaning
their
loss
upon
the
road
,
are
fretfully
bewailing
,
as
openly
as
she
dared
,
the
undutiful
conduct
of
her
handsome
girl
in
depriving
her
of
a
supper
,
on
the
very
first
night
of
their
reunion
.
  
<EOS>
Supperless
to
bed
she
went
,
saving
for
a
few
coarse
fragments
;
and
those
she
sat
mumbling
and
munching
over
a
scrap
of
fire
,
long
after
her
undutiful
daughter
lay
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
Were
this
miserable
mother
,
and
this
miserable
daughter
,
only
the
reduction
to
their
lowest
grade
,
of
certain
social
vices
sometimes
prevailing
higher
up
?
<EOS>
In
this
round
world
of
many
circles
within
circles
,
do
we
make
a
weary
journey
from
the
high
grade
to
the
low
,
to
find
at
last
that
they
lie
close
together
,
that
the
two
extremes
touch
,
and
that
our
journey
's
end
is
but
our
starting
-
place
?
<EOS>
Allowing
for
great
difference
of
stuff
and
texture
,
was
the
pattern
of
this
woof
repeated
among
gentle
blood
at
all
?

Say

And
Cleopatra

The
Happy

THE
dark
blot

<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
mansion
,
if
it
be
a
gap
among
the
other
houses
any

,
is
only
so
because

be

never

Lights
are
sparkling
in
the
windows
this
evening
,
and
the
ruddy
glow
of
fires
is
warm
and
bright
upon
the
hangings
and
soft
carpets
,
and
the
dinner
waits
to
be
served
,
and
the
dinnertable
is
handsomely
set
forth
,
though
only
for
four
persons
,
and
the
sideboard
is
cumbrous
with
plate
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
first
time
that
the
house
has
been
arranged
for
occupation
since
its
late
changes
,
and
the
happy
pair
are
looked
for
every

Only
second
to
the
wedding
morning
,
in
the
interest
and
expectation
it
engenders
among
the
household
,
is
this
evening
of

Mrs
Perch
is
in
the
kitchen
taking
tea
;
and
has
made
the
tour
of
the
establishment
,
and
priced
the
silks
and
damasks
by
the
yard
,
and
exhausted
every
interjection
in
the
dictionary
and
out
of
it
expressive
of
admiration
and
wonder
.
<EOS>
The
upholsterer
's
foreman
,
who
has
left
his
hat
,
with
a
pocket

handkerchief
in
it
,
both
smelling
strongly
of
varnish
,
under
a
chair
in
the
hall
,
lurks
about
the
house
,
gazing
upwards
at
the
cornices
,
and
downward
at
the
carpets
,
and
occasionally
,
in
a
silent
transport
of
enjoyment
,
taking
a
rule
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
skirmishingly
measuring
expensive
objects
,
with
unutterable
feelings
.
<EOS>
Cook
is
in
high
spirits
,
and
says
give
her
a
place
where
there
's
plenty
of
company
(
as
she
'll
bet
you
sixpence
there
will
be
now
)
,
for
she
is
of
a
lively
disposition
,
and
she
always
was
from
a
child
,
and
she
do
n't
mind
who
knows
it
;
<EOS>
which
sentiment
elicits
from
the
breast
of
Mrs
Perch
a
responsive
murmur
of
support
and
approbation
.
<EOS>
All
the
housemaid
hopes
is
,
happiness
for
'em
---
but
marriage
is
a
lottery
,
and
the
more
she
thinks
about
it
,
the
more
she
feels
the
independence
and
the
safety
of
a
single
life
.
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
is
saturnine
and
grim
,
and
says
that
's
his
opinion
too
,
and
give
him
War
besides
,
and
down
with
the
French
---
for
this
young
man
has
a
general
impression
that
every
foreigner
is
a
Frenchman
and
must
be
by
the
laws
of
nature
.
  
<EOS>
At
each
new
sound
of
wheels
,
they
all
stop
,
whatever
they
are
saying
,
and
listen
;
and
more
than
once
there
is
a
general
starting
up
and
a
cry
of
"
Here
they
are
!
"
<EOS>
But
here
they
are
not
yet
;
and
Cook
begins
to
mourn
over
the
dinner
,
which
has
been
put
back
twice
,
and
the
upholsterer
's
foreman
still
goes
lurking
about
the
rooms
,
undisturbed
in
his
blissful
reverie
!
  
<EOS>
Florence
is
ready
to
receive
her
father
and
her
new
mama
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
emotions
that
are
throbbing
in
her
breast
originate
in
pleasure
or
in
pain
,
she
hardly
knows
.
<EOS>
But
the
fluttering
heart
sends
added
colour
to
her
cheeks
,
and
brightness
to
her
eyes
;
and
they
say
down
stairs
,
drawing
their
heads
together
<EOS>
---
for
they
always
speak
softly
when
they
speak
of
her
---
how
beautiful
Miss
Florence
looks
to
-
night
,
and
what
a
sweet
young
lady
she
has
grown
,
poor
dear
!
<EOS>
A
pause
succeeds
;
and
then
Cook
,
feeling
,
as
president
,
that
her
sentiments
are
waited
for
,
wonders
whether
---
and
there
stops
.
<EOS>
The
housemaid
wonders
too
,
and
so
does
Mrs
Perch
,
who
has
the
happy
social
faculty
of
always
wondering
when
other
people
wonder
,
without
being
at
all
particular
what
she
wonders
at
.
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
,
who
now
descries
an
opportunity
of
bringing
down
the
spirits
of
the
ladies
to
his
own
level
,
says
wait
and
see
<EOS>
;
he
wishes
some
people
were
well
out
of
this
.
<EOS>
Cook
leads
a
sigh
then
,
and
a
murmur
of
"
Ah
,
it
's
a
strange
world
,
it
is
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
and
when
it
has
gone
round
the
table
,
adds
persuasively
,
"
but
Miss
Florence
ca
n't
well
be
the
worse
for
any
change
,
Tom
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
's
rejoinder
,
pregnant
with
frightful
meaning
,
is
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
ca
n't
she
though
!
"
<EOS>
and
sensible
that
a
mere
man
can
scarcely
be
more
prophetic
,
or
improve
upon
that
,
he
holds
his
peace
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
,
prepared
to
greet
her
darling
daughter
and
dear
son
-
in

law
with
open
arms
,
is
appropriately
attired
for
that
purpose
in
a
very
youthful
costume
,
with
short
sleeves
.
<EOS>
At
present
,
however
,
her
ripe
charms
are
blooming
in
the
shade
of
her
own
apartments
,
whence
she
has
not
emerged
since
she
took
possession
of
them
a
few
hours
ago
,
and
where
she
is
fast
growing
fretful
,
on
account
of
the
postponement
of
dinner
.
<EOS>
The
maid
who
ought
to
be
a
skeleton
,
but
is
in
truth
a
buxom
damsel
,
is
,
on
the
other
hand
,
in
a
most
amiable
state
:
considering
her
quarterly
stipend
much
safer
than
heretofore
,
and
foreseeing
a
great
improvement
in
her
board
and
lodging
.
  
<EOS>
Where
are
the
happy
pair
,
for
whom
this
brave
home
is
waiting
?
<EOS>
Do
steam
,
tide
,
wind
,
and
horses
,
all
abate
their
speed
,
to
linger
on
such
happiness
?
<EOS>
Does
the
swarm
of
loves
and
graces
hovering
about
them
retard
their
progress
by
its
numbers
?
<EOS>
Are
there
so
many
flowers
in
their
happy
path
,
that
they
can
scarcely
move
along
,
without
entanglement
in
thornless
roses
,
and
sweetest
briar
?
  
<EOS>
They
are
here
at
last
!
<EOS>
The
noise
of
wheels
is
heard
,
grows
louder
,
and
a
carriage
drives
up
to
the
door
!
<EOS>
A
thundering
knock
from
the
obnoxious
foreigner
anticipates
the
rush
of
Mr
Towlinson
and
party
to
open
it
;
and
Mr
Dombey
and
his
bride
alight
,
and
walk
in
arm
in
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
sweetest
Edith
!
<EOS>
"
cries
an
agitated
voice
upon
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dearest
Dombey
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
short
sleeves
wreath
themselves
about
the
happy
couple
in
turn
,
and
embrace
them
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
had
come
down
to
the
hall
too
,
but
did
not
advance
:
reserving
her
timid
welcome
until
these
nearer
and
dearer
transports
should
subside
.
<EOS>
But
the
eyes
of
Edith
sought
her
out
,
upon
the
threshold
;
and
dismissing
her
sensitive
parent
with
a
slight
kiss
on
the
cheek
,
she
hurried
on
to
Florence
and
embraced
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Florence
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
putting
out
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
As
Florence
,
trembling
,
raised
it
to
her
lips
,
she
met
his
glance
.
<EOS>
The
look
was
cold
and
distant
enough
,
but
it
stirred
her
heart
to
think
that
she
observed
in
it
something
more
of
interest
than
he
had
ever
shown
before
.
<EOS>
It
even
expressed
a
kind
of
faint
surprise
,
and
not
a
disagreeable
surprise
,
at
sight
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
dared
not
raise
her
eyes
to
his
any
more
;
but
she
felt
that
he
looked
at
her
once
again
,
and
hot
less
favourably
.
<EOS>
Oh
what
a
thrill
of
joy
shot
through
her
,
awakened
by
even
this
intangible
and
baseless
confirmation
of
her
hope
that
she
would
learn
to
win
him
,
through
her
new
and
beautiful
mama
!
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
be
long
dressing
,
Mrs
Dombey
,
I
presume
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
ready
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
them
send
up
dinner
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
Mr
Dombey
stalked
away
to
his
own
dressingroom
,
and
Mrs
Dombey
went
upstairs
to
hers
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
and
Florence
repaired
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
where
that
excellent
mother
considered
it
incumbent
on
her
to
shed
a
few
irrepressible
tears
,
supposed
to
be
forced
from
her
by
her
daughter
's
felicity
;
and
which
she
was
still
drying
,
very
gingerly
,
with
a
laced
corner
of
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
when
her
son
-
in
-
law
appeared
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
,
my
dearest
Dombey
,
did
you
find
that
delightfullest
of
cities
,
Paris
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
subduing
her
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
cold
,
"
returned
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gay
as
ever
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
of
course
.
"
  
"
Not
particularly
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
dull
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fie
,
my
dearest
Dombey
!
"
<EOS>
archly
;
"
dull
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
made
that
impression
upon
me
,
madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
with
grave
politeness
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
Mrs
Dombey
found
it
dull
too
.
<EOS>
She
mentioned
once
or
twice
that
she
thought
it
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
naughty
girl
!
"
cried
Mrs
Skewton
,
rallying
her
dear
child
,
who
now
entered
,
"
what
dreadfully
heretical
things
have
you
been
saying
about
Paris
?
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
raised
her
eyebrows
with
an
air
of
weariness
;
and
passing
the
folding
-
doors
which
were
thrown
open
to
display
the
suite
of
rooms
in
their
new
and
handsome
garniture
,
and
barely
glancing
at
them
as
she
passed
,
sat
down
by
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Dombey
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
how
charmingly
these
people
have
carried
out
every
idea
that
we
hinted
.
<EOS>
They
have
made
a
perfect
palace
of
the
house
,
positively
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
handsome
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
looking
round
.
<EOS>
"
I
directed
that
no
expense
should
be
spared
;
and
all
that
money
could
do
,
has
been
done
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
can
it
not
do
,
dear
Dombey
?
"
observed
Cleopatra
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
powerful
,
madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
He
looked
in
his
solemn
way
towards
his
wife
,
but
not
a
word
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Mrs
Dombey
,
"
addressing
her
after
a
moment
's
silence
,
with
especial
distinctness
;
"
that
these
alterations
meet
with
your
approval
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
as
handsome
as
they
can
be
,
"
she
returned
,
with
haughty
carelessness
.
<EOS>
"
They
should
be
so
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
And
I
suppose
they
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
An
expression
of
scorn
was
habitual
to
the
proud
face
,
and
seemed
inseparable
from
it
;
but
the
contempt
with
which
it
received
any
appeal
to
admiration
,
respect
,
or
consideration
on
the
ground
of
his
riches
,
no
matter
how
slight
or
ordinary
in
itself
,
was
a
new
and
different
expression
,
unequalled
in
intensity
by
any
other
of
which
it
was
capable
.
<EOS>
Whether
Mr
Dombey
,
wrapped
in
his
own
greatness
,
was
at
all
aware
of
this
,
or
no
,
there
had
not
been
wanting
opportunities
already
for
his
complete
enlightenment
;
and
at
that
moment
it
might
have
been
effected
by
the
one
glance
of
the
dark
eye
that
lighted
on
him
,
after
it
had
rapidly
and
scornfully
surveyed
the
theme
of
his
self
-
glorification
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
read
in
that
one
glance
that
nothing
that
his
wealth
could
do
,
though
it
were
increased
ten
thousand
fold
,
could
win
him
for
its
own
sake
,
one
look
of
softened
recognition
from
the
defiant
woman
,
linked
to
him
,
but
arrayed
with
her
whole
soul
against
him
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
read
in
that
one
glance
that
even
for
its
sordid
and
mercenary
influence
upon
herself
,
she
spurned
it
,
while
she
claimed
its
utmost
power
as
her
right
,
her
bargain
---
as
the
base
and
worthless
recompense
for
which
she
had
become
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
read
in
it
that
,
ever
baring
her
own
head
for
the
lightning
of
her
own
contempt
and
pride
to
strike
,
the
most
innocent
allusion
to
the
power
of
his
riches
degraded
her
anew
,
sunk
her
deeper
in
her
own
respect
,
and
made
the
blight
and
waste
within
her
more
complete
.
  
<EOS>
But
dinner
was
announced
,
and
Mr
Dombey
led
down
Cleopatra
;
Edith
and
his
daughter
following
.
<EOS>
Sweeping
past
the
gold
and
silver
demonstration
on
the
sideboard
as
if
it
were
heaped
-
up
dirt
,
and
deigning
to
bestow
no
look
upon
the
elegancies
around
her
,
she
took
her
place
at
his
board
for
the
first
time
,
and
sat
,
like
a
statue
,
at
the
feast
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
being
a
good
deal
in
the
statue
way
himself
,
was
well
enough
pleased
to
see
his
handsome
wife
immovable
and
proud
and
cold
.
<EOS>
Her
deportment
being
always
elegant
and
graceful
,
this
as
a
general
behavior
was
agreeable
and
congenial
to
him
.
<EOS>
Presiding
,
therefore
,
with
his
accustomed
dignity
,
and
not
at
all
reflecting
on
his
wife
by
any
warmth
or
hilarity
of
his
own
,
he
performed
his
share
of
the
honours
of
the
table
with
a
cool
satisfaction
;
and
the
installation
dinner
,
though
not
regarded
downstairs
as
a
great
success
,
or
very
promising
beginning
,
passed
off
,
above
,
in
a
sufficiently
polite
,
genteel
,
and
frosty
manner
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
tea
,
Mrs
Skewton
,
who
affected
to
be
quite
overcome
and
worn
out
by
her
emotions
of
happiness
,
arising
in
the
contemplation
of
her
dear
child
united
to
the
man
of
her
heart
,
but
who
,
there
is
reason
to
suppose
,
found
this
family
party
somewhat
dull
,
as
she
yawned
for
one
hour
continually
behind
her
fan
,
retired
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Edith
,
also
,
silently
withdrew
and
came
back
no
more
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
it
happened
that
Florence
,
who
had
been
upstairs
to
have
some
conversation
with
Diogenes
,
returning
to
the
drawing
-
room
with
her
little
work
-
basket
,
found
no
one
there
but
her
father
,
who
was
walking
to
and
fro
,
in
dreary
magnificence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
go
away
,
papa
?
"
said
Florence
faintly
,
hesitating
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returned
Mr
Dombey
,
looking
round
over
his
shoulder
;
"
you
can
come
and
go
here
,
Florence
,
as
you

This
is
not
my
private
room

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
entered
,
and
sat
down
at
a
distant
little
table
with
her
work
:
finding
herself
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
---
for
the
very
first
time
within
her
memory
from
her
infancy
to
that
hour
---
alone
with
her
father
,
as
his
companion
.
<EOS>
She
,
his
natural
companion
,
his
only
child
,
who
in
her
lonely
life
and
grief
had
known
the
suffering
of
a
breaking
heart
;
who
,
in
her
rejected
love
,
had
never
breathed
his
name
to
God
at
night
,
but
with
a
tearful
blessing
,
heavier
on
him
than
a
curse
;
who
had
prayed
to
die
young
,
so
she
might
only
die
in
his
arms
;
who
had
,
all
through
,
repaid
the
agony
of
slight
and
coldness
,
and
dislike
,
with
patient
unexacting
love
,
excusing
him
,
and
pleading
for
him
,
like
his
better
angel
!
  
<EOS>
She
trembled
,
and
her
eyes
were
dim
.
<EOS>
His
figure
seemed
to
grow
in
height
and
bulk
before
her
as
he
paced
the
room
:
now
it
was
all
blurred
and
indistinct
;
now
clear
again
,
and
plain
;
and
now
she
seemed
to
think
that
this
had
happened
,
just
the
same
,
a
multitude
of
years
ago
.
<EOS>
She
yearned
towards
him
,
and
yet
shrunk
from
his
approach
.
<EOS>
Unnatural
emotion
in
a
child
,
innocent
of
wrong
!
<EOS>
Unnatural
the
hand
that
had
directed
the
sharp
plough
,
which
furrowed
up
her
gentle
nature
for
the
sowing
of
its
seeds
!
  
<EOS>
Bent
upon
not
distressing
or
offending
him
by
her
distress
,
Florence
controlled
herself
,
and
sat
quietly
at
her
work
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
more
turns
across
and
across
the
room
,
he
left
off
pacing
it
;
and
withdrawing
into
a
shadowy
corner
at
some
distance
,
where
there
was
an
easy
chair
,
covered
his
head
with
a
handkerchief
,
and
composed
himself
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
enough
for
Florence
to
sit
there
watching
him
;
turning
her
eyes
towards
his
chair
from
time
to
time
;
watching
him
with
her
thoughts
,
when
her
face
was
intent
upon
her
work
;
and
sorrowfully
glad
to
think
that
he
could
sleep
,
while
she
was
there
,
and
that
he
was
not
made
restless
by
her
strange
and
long
-
forbidden
presence
.
  
<EOS>
What
would
have
been
her
thoughts
if
she
had
known
that
he
was
steadily
regarding
her
;
that
the
veil
upon
his
face
,
by
accident
or
by
design
,
was
so
adjusted
that
his
sight
was
free
,
and
that
it
never
wandered
from
her
face
an
instant
!
<EOS>
That
when
she
looked
towards
him
,
in
the
obscure
dark
corner
,
her
speaking
eyes
,
more
earnest
and
pathetic
in
their
voiceless
speech
than
all
the
orators
of
all
the
world
,
and
impeaching
him
more
nearly
in
their
mute
address
,
met
his
,
and
did
not
know
it
!
<EOS>
That
when
she
bent
her
head
again
over
her
work
,
he
drew
his
breath
more
easily
,
but
with
the
same
attention
looked
upon
her
still
---
upon
her
white
brow
and
her
falling
hair
,
and
busy
hands
;
and
once
attracted
,
seemed
to
have
no
power
to
turn
his
eyes
away
!
  
<EOS>
And
what
were
his
thoughts
meanwhile
?
<EOS>
With
what
emotions
did
he
prolong
the
attentive
gaze
covertly
directed
on
his
unknown
daughter
?
<EOS>
Was
there
reproach
to
him
in
the
quiet
figure
and
the
mild
eyes
?
<EOS>
Had
he
begun
to
feel
her
disregarded
claims
,
and
did
they
touch
him
home
at
last
,
and
waken
him
to
some
sense
of
his
cruel
injustice
?
  
<EOS>
There
are
yielding
moments
in
the
lives
of
the
sternest
and
harshest
men
,
though
such
men
often
keep
their
secret
well
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
her
in
her
beauty
,
almost
changed
into
a
woman
without
his
knowledge
,
may
have
struck
out
some
such
moments
even
in
his
life
of
pride
.
<EOS>
Some
passing
thought
that
he
had
had
a
happy
home
within
his
reach
---
had
had
a
household
spirit
bending
at
his
feet
---
had
overlooked
it
in
his
stiffnecked
sullen
arrogance
,
and
wandered
away
and
lost
himself
,
may
have
engendered
them
.
<EOS>
Some
simple
eloquence
distinctly
heard
,
though
only
uttered
in
her
eyes
,
unconscious
that
he
read
them
,
as
"
By
the
death
-
beds
I
have
tended
,
by
the
childhood
I
have
suffered
,
by
our
meeting
in
this
dreary
house
at
midnight
,
by
the
cry
wrung
from
me
in
the
anguish
of
my
heart
,
oh
,
father
,
turn
to
me
and
seek
a
refuge
in
my
love
before
it
is
too
late
!
"
may
have
arrested
them
.
<EOS>
Meaner
and
lower
thoughts
,
as
that
his
dead
boy
was
now
superseded
by
new
ties
,
and
he
could
forgive
the
having
been
supplanted
in
his
affection
,
may
have
occasioned
them
.
<EOS>
The
mere
association
of
her
as
an
ornament
,
with
all
the
ornament
and
pomp
about
him
,
may
have
been
sufficient
.
<EOS>
But
as
he
looked
,
he
softened
to
her
,
more
and
more
.
<EOS>
As
he
looked
,
she
became
blended
with
the
child
he
had
loved
,
and
he
could
hardly
separate
the
two
.
<EOS>
As
he
looked
,
he
saw
her
for
an
instant
by
a
clearer
and
a
brighter
light
,
not
bending
over
that
child
's
pillow
as
his
rival
---
monstrous
thought
---
<EOS>
but
as
the
spirit
of
his
home
,
and
in
the
action
tending
himself
no
less
,
as
he
sat
once
more
with
his
bowed
-
down
head
upon
his
hand
at
the
foot
of
the
little
bed
.
<EOS>
He
felt
inclined
to
speak
to
her
,
and
call
her
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
words
"
Florence
,
come
here
!
"
were
rising
to
his
lips
---
but
slowly
and
with
difficulty
,
they
were
so
very
strange
---
when
they
were
checked
and
stifled
by
a
footstep
on
the
stair
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
his
wife
's
.
<EOS>
She
had
exchanged
her
dinner
dress
for
a
loose
robe
,
and
unbound
her
hair
,
which
fell
freely
about
her
neck
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
not
the
change
in
her
that
startled
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Florence
,
dear
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
have
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
sat
down
by
the
side
of
Florence
,
she
stooped
and
kissed
her
hand
.
<EOS>
He
hardly
knew
his
wife
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
changed
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
merely
that
her
smile
was
new
to
him
---
though
that
he
had
never
seen
:
but
her
manner
,
the
tone
of
her
voice
,
the
light
of
her
eyes
,
the
interest
,
and
confidence
,
and
winning
wish
to
please
,
expressed
in
all
<EOS>
---
this
was
not
Edith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Softly
,
dear
Mama
.
<EOS>
Papa
is
asleep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
Edith
now
.
<EOS>
She
looked
towards
the
corner
where
he
was
,
and
he
knew
that
face
and
manner
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
scarcely
thought
you
could
be
here
,
Florence
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
,
how
altered
and
how
softened
,
in
an
instant
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
left
here
early
,
"
pursued
Edith
,
"
purposely
to
sit
up
stairs
and
talk
with
you
.
<EOS>
But
,
going
to
your
room
,
I
found
my
bird
was
flown
,
and
I
have
been
waiting
there
ever
since
,
expecting
its
return
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
it
had
been
a
bird
,
indeed
,
she
could
not
have
taken
it
more
tenderly
and
gently
to
her
breast
,
than
she
did
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
dear
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
will
not
expect
to
find
me
,
I
suppose
,
when
he
wakes
,
"
hesitated
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
he
will
,
Florence
?
"
said
Edith
,
looking
full
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
drooped
her
head
,
and
rose
,
and
put
up
her
workbasket
.
<EOS>
Edith
drew
her
hand
through
her
arm
,
and
they
went
out
of
the
room
like
sisters
.
<EOS>
Her
very
step
was
different
and
new
to
him
,
Mr
Dombey
thought
,
as
his
eyes
followed
her
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
He
sat
in
his
shadowy
corner
so
long
,
that
the
church
clocks
struck
the
hour
three
times
before
he
moved
that
night
.
<EOS>
All
that
while
his
face
was
still
intent
upon
the
spot
where
Florence
had
been
seated
.
<EOS>
The
room
grew
darker
,
as
the
candles
waned
and
went
out
;
but
a
darkness
gathered
on
his
face
,
exceeding
any
that
the
night
could
cast
,
and
rested
there
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
and
Edith
,
seated
before
the
fire
in
the
remote
room
where
little
Paul
had
died
,
talked
together
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
Diogenes
,
who
was
of
the
party
,
had
at
first
objected
to
the
admission
of
Edith
,
and
,
even
in
deference
to
his
mistress
's
wish
,
had
only
permitted
it
under
growling
protest
.
<EOS>
But
,
emerging
by
little
and
little
from
the
ante
-
room
,
whither
he
had
retired
in
dudgeon
,
he
soon
appeared
to
comprehend
,
that
with
the
most
amiable
intensions
he
had
made
one
of
those
mistakes
which
will
occasionally
arise
in
the
best
-
regulated
dogs
'
minds
;
as
a
friendly
apology
for
which
he
stuck
himself
up
on
end
between
the
two
,
in
a
very
hot
place
in
front
of
the
fire
,
and
sat
panting
at
it
,
with
his
tongue
out
,
and
a
most
imbecile
expression
of
countenance
,
listening
to
the
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
It
turned
,
at
first
,
on
Florence
's
books
and
favourite
pursuits
,
and
on
the
manner
in
which
she
had
beguiled
the
interval
since
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
The
last
theme
opened
up
to
her
a
subject
which
lay
very
near
her
heart
,
and
she
said
,
with
the
tears
starting
to
her
eyes
:
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mama
!
<EOS>
I
have
had
a
great
sorrow
since
that
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
a
great
sorrow
,
Florence
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Poor
Walter
is
drowned
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
spread
her
hands
before
her
face
,
and
wept
with
all
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Many
as
were
the
secret
tears
which
Walter
's
fate
had
cost
her
,
they
flowed
yet
,
when
she
thought
or
spoke
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
tell
me
,
dear
,
"
said
Edith
,
soothing
her
.
<EOS>
"
Who
was
Walter
?
<EOS>
What
was
he
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
my
brother
,
Mama
.
<EOS>
After
dear
Paul
died
,
we
said
we
would
be
brother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
I
had
known
him
a
long
time
---
from
a
little
child
.
<EOS>
He
knew
Paul
,
who
liked
him
very
much
;
Paul
said
,
almost
at
the
last
,
"
Take
care
of
Walter
,
dear
papa!I
was
fond
of
him
!
"
<EOS>
Walter
had
been
brought
in
to
see
him
,
and
was
there
then
---
in
this
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
he
take
care
of
Walter
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Edith
,
sternly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
?
<EOS>
He
appointed
him
to
go
abroad
.
<EOS>
He
was
drowned
in
shipwreck
on
his
voyage
,
"
said
Florence
,
sobbing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
he
know
that
he
is
dead
?
"
asked
Edith
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
,
Mama
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
means
of
knowing
.
<EOS>
Dear
Mama
!
"
cried
Florence
,
clinging
to
her
as
for
help
,
and
hiding
her
face
upon
her
bosom
,
"
I
know
that
you
have
seen
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
Stay
!
<EOS>
Stop
,
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
Edith
turned
so
pale
,
and
spoke
so
earnestly
,
that
Florence
did
not
need
her
restraining
hand
upon
her
lips
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
all
about
Walter
first
;
let
me
understand
this
history
all
through
.
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
related
it
,
and
everything
belonging
to
it
,
even
down
to
the
friendship
of
Mr
Toots
,
of
whom
she
could
hardly
speak
in
her
distress
without
a
tearful
smile
,
although
she
was
deeply
grateful
to
him
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
concluded
her
account
,
to
the
whole
of
which
Edith
,
holding
her
hand
,
listened
with
close
attention
,
and
when
a
silence
had
succeeded
,
Edith
said
:
  
"
What
is
it
that
you
know
I
have
seen
,
Florence
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
am
not
,
"
said
Florence
,
with
the
same
mute
appeal
,
and
the
same
quick
concealment
of
her
face
as
before
,
"
that
I
am
not
a
favourite
child
,
Mama
.
<EOS>
I
never
have
been
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
known
how
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
have
missed
the
way
,
and
had
no
one
to
show
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
let
me
learn
from
you
how
to
become
dearer
to
Papa
.
<EOS>
Teach
me
!
<EOS>
you
,
who
can
so
well
!
"
and
clinging
close
to
her
,
with
some
broken
fervent
words
of
gratitude
and
endearment
,
Florence
,
relived
of
her
sad
secret
,
wept
long
,
but
not
as
painfully
as
of
yore
,
within
the
encircling
arms
of
her
new
mother
.
  
<EOS>
Pale
even
to
her
lips
,
and
with
a
face
that
strove
for
composure
until
its
proud
beauty
was
as
fixed
as
death
<EOS>
,
Edith
looked
down
upon
the
weeping
girl
,
and
once
kissed
her
.
<EOS>
Then
gradually
disengaging
herself
,
and
putting
Florence
away
,
she
said
,
stately
,
and
quiet
as
a
marble
image
,
and
in
a
voice
that
deepened
as
she
spoke
,
but
had
no
other
token
of
emotion
in
it
:
  
<EOS>
"
Florence
,
you
do
not
know
me
!
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
that
you
should
learn
from
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
learn
from
you
?
"
<EOS>
repeated
Florence
,
in
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
should
teach
you
how
to
love
,
or
be
loved
,
Heaven
forbid
!
"
said
Edith
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
could
teach
me
,
that
were
better
;
but
it
is
too
late
.
<EOS>
You
are
dear
to
me
,
Florence
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
that
anything
could
ever
be
so
dear
to
me
,
as
you
are
in
this
little
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
saw
that
Florence
would
have
spoken
here
,
so
checked
her
with
her
hand
,
and
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
your
true
friend
always
.
<EOS>
I
will
cherish
you
,
as
much
,
if
not
as
well
as
any
one
in
this
world
could
.
<EOS>
You
may
trust
in
me
---
I
know
it
<EOS>
and
I
say
it
,
dear
,
---
with
the
whole
confidence
even
of
your
pure
heart
.
<EOS>
There
are
hosts
of
women
whom
he
might
have
married
,
better
and
truer
in
all
other
respects
than
I
am
,
Florence
;
but
there
is
not
one
who
could
come
here
,
his
wife
,
whose
heart
could
beat
with
greater
truth
to
you
than
mine
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
dear
Mama
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
From
that
first
most
happy
day
I
have
known
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Most
happy
day
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Edith
seemed
to
repeat
the
words
involuntarily
,
and
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
Though
the
merit
is
not
mine
,
for
I
thought
little
of
you
until
I
saw
you
,
let
the
undeserved
reward
be
mine
in
your
trust
and
love
.
<EOS>
And
in
this
---
in
this
,
Florence
;
on
the
first
night
of
my
taking
up
my
abode
here
;
I
am
led
on
as
it
is
best
I
should
be
,
to
say
it
for
the
first
and
last
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
,
without
knowing
why
,
felt
almost
afraid
to
hear
her
proceed
,
but
kept
her
eyes
riveted
on
the
beautiful
face
so
fixed
upon
her
own
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
seek
to
find
in
me
,
"
said
Edith
,
laying
her
hand
upon
her
breast
,
"
what
is
not
here
.
<EOS>
Never
if
you
can
help
it
,
Florence
,
fall
off
from
me
because
it
is
not
here
.
<EOS>
Little
by
little
you
will
know
me
better
,
and
the
time
will
come
when
you
will
know
me
,
as
I
know
myself
.
<EOS>
Then
,
be
as
lenient
to
me
as
you
can
,
and
do
not
turn
to
bitterness
the
only
sweet
remembrance
I
shall
have
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
tears
that
were
visible
in
her
eyes
as
she
kept
them
fixed
on
Florence
,
showed
that
the
composed
face
was
but
as
a
handsome
mask
;
but
she
preserved
it
,
and
continued
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
what
you
say
,
and
know
how
true
it
is
.
<EOS>
But
believe
me
---
you
will
soon
,
if
you
can
not
now
---
there
is
no
one
on
this
earth
less
qualified
to
set
it
right
or
help
you
,
Florence
,
than
I.
Never
ask
me
why
,
or
speak
to
me
about
it
or
of
my
husband
,
more
.
<EOS>
There
should
be
,
so
far
,
as
division
,
and
a
silence
between
us
two
,
like
the
grave
itself
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
sat
for
some
time
silent
;
Florence
scarcely
venturing
to
breathe
meanwhile
,
as
dim
and
imperfect
shadows
of
the
truth
,
and
all
its
daily
consequences
,
chased
each
other
through
her
terrified
,
yet
incredulous
imagination
.
<EOS>
Almost
as
soon
as
she
had
ceased
to
speak
,
Edith
's
face
began
to
subside
from
its
set
composure
to
that
quieter
and
more
relenting
aspect
,
which
it
usually
wore
when
she
and
Florence
were
alone
together
.
<EOS>
She
shaded
it
,
after
this
change
,
with
her
hands
;
and
when
she
arose
,
and
with
an
affectionate
embrace
bade
Florence
good
night
,
went
quickly
,
and
without
looking
round
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
Florence
was
in
bed
,
and
the
room
was
dark
except
for
the
glow
of
the
fire
,
Edith
returned
,
and
saying
that
she
could
not
sleep
,
and
that
her
dressing
-
room
was
lonely
,
drew
a
chair
upon
the
hearth
,
and
watched
the
embers
as
they
died
away
.
<EOS>
Florence
watched
them
too
from
her
bed
,
until
they
,
and
the
noble
figure
before
them
,
crowned
with
its
flowing
hair
,
and
in
its
thoughtful
eyes
reflecting
back
their
light
,
became
confused
and
indistinct
,
and
finally
were
lost
in
slumber
.
  
<EOS>
In
her
sleep
,
however
,
Florence
could
not
lose
an
undefined
impression
of
what
had
so
recently
passed
.
<EOS>
It
formed
the
subject
of
her
dreams
,
and
haunted
her
;
now
in
one
shape
,
now
in
another
;
but
always
oppressively
;
and
with
a
sense
of
fear
.
<EOS>
She
dreamed
of
seeking
her
father
in
wildernesses
,
of
following
his
track
up
fearful
heights
,
and
down
into
deep
mines
and
caverns
;
of
being
charged
with
something
that
would
release
him
from
extraordinary
suffering
---
she
knew
not
what
,
or
why
---
yet
never
being
able
to
attain
the
goal
and
set
him
free
.
<EOS>
Then
she
saw
him
dead
,
upon
that
very
bed
,
and
in
that
very
room
,
and
knew
that
he
had
never
loved
her
to
the
last
,
and
fell
upon
his
cold
breast
,
passionately
weeping
.
<EOS>
Then
a
prospect
opened
,
and
a
river
flowed
,
and
a
plaintive
voice
she
knew
,
cried
,
"
It
is
running
on
,
Floy
!
<EOS>
It
has
never
stopped
!
<EOS>
You
are
moving
with
it
!
"
<EOS>
And
she
saw
him
at
a
distance
stretching
out
his
arms
towards
her
,
while
a
figure
such
as
Walter
's
used
to
be
,
stood
near
him
,
awfully
serene
and
still
.
<EOS>
In
every
vision
,
Edith
came
and
went
,
sometimes
to
her
joy
,
sometimes
to
her
sorrow
,
until
they
were
along
upon
the
brink
of
a
dark
grave
,
and
Edith
pointing
down
,
she
looked
and
saw
---
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
another
Edith
lying
at
the
bottom
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
terror
of
this
dream
,
she
cried
out
and
awoke
,
she
thought
.
<EOS>
A
soft
voice
seemed
to
whisper
in
her
ear
,
<EOS>
"
Florence
,
dear
Florence
,
it
is
nothing
but
a
dream
!
"
and
stretching
out
her
arms
,
she
returned
the
caress
of
her
new
mama
,
who
then
went
out
at
the
door
in
the
light
of
the
grey
morning
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
,
Florence
sat
up
wondering
whether
this
had
really
taken
place
or
not
;
but
she
was
only
certain
that
it
was
grey
morning
indeed
,
and
that
the
blackened
ashes
of
the
fire
were
on
the
hearth
,
and
that
she
was
alone
.
  
<EOS>
So
passed
the
night
on
which
the
happy
pair
came
home
.

Chapter

<EOS>
Housewarming
 
MANY
succeeding
days
passed
in
like
manner
;
except
that
there
were
numerous
visits
received
and
paid
,
and
that
Mrs
Skewton
held
little
levees
in
her
own
apartments
,
at
which
Major
Bagstock
was
a
frequent
attendant
,
and
that
Florence
encountered
no
second
look
from
her
father
,
although
she
saw
him
every
day
.
<EOS>
Nor
had
she
much
communication
in
words
with
her
new
mama
,
who
was
imperious
and
proud
to
all
the
house
but
her
<EOS>
---
Florence
could
not
but
observe
that
---
and
who
,
although
she
always
sent
for
her
or
went
to
her
when
she
came
home
from
visiting
,
and
would
always
go
into
her
room
at
night
,
before
retiring
to
rest
,
however
late
the
hour
,
and
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
being
with
her
,
was
often
her
silent
and
thoughtful
companion
for
a
long
time
together
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
,
who
had
hoped
for
so
much
from
this
marriage
,
could
not
help
sometimes
comparing
the
bright
house
with
the
faded
dreary
place
out
of
which
it
had
arisen
,
and
wondering
when
,
in
any
shape
,
it
would
begin
to
be
a
home
;
for
that
it
was
no
home
then
,
for
any
one
,
though
everything
went
on
luxuriously
and
regularly
,
she
had
always
a
secret
misgiving
.
<EOS>
Many
an
hour
of
sorrowful
reflection
by
day
and
night
,
and
many
a
tear
of
blighted
hope
,
Florence
bestowed
upon
the
assurance
her
new
mama
had
given
her
so
strongly
,
that
there
was
no
one
on
the
earth
more
powerless
than
herself
to
teach
her
how
to
win
her
father
's
heart
.
<EOS>
And
soon
Florence
began
to
think
---
resolved
to
think
would
be
the
truer
phrase
<EOS>
---
that
as
no
one
knew
so
well
,
how
hopeless
of
being
subdued
or
changed
her
father
's
coldness
to
her
was
,
so
she
had
given
her
this
warning
,
and
forbidden
the
subject
in
very
compassion
.
<EOS>
Unselfish
here
,
as
in
her
every
act
and
fancy
,
Florence
preferred
to
bear
the
pain
of
this
new
wound
,
rather
than
encourage
any
faint
foreshadowings
of
the
truth
as
it
concerned
her
father
;
tender
of
him
,
even
in
her
wandering
thoughts
.
<EOS>
As
for
his
home
,
she
hoped
it
would
become
a
better
one
,
when
its
state
of
novelty
and
transition
should
be
over
;
and
for
herself
,
thought
little
and
lamented
less
.
  
<EOS>
If
none
of
the
new
family
were
particularly
at
home
in
private
,
it
was
resolved
that
Mrs
Dombey
at
least
should
be
at
home
in
public
,
without
delay
.
<EOS>
A
series
of
entertainments
in
celebration
of
the
late
nuptials
,
and
in
cultivation
of
society
,
were
arranged
,
chiefly
by
Mr
Dombey
and
Mrs
Skewton
;
and
it
was
settled
that
the
festive
proceedings
should
commence
by
Mrs
Dombey
's
being
at
home
upon
a
certain
evening
,
and
by
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Dombey
's
requesting
the
honour
of
the
company
of
a
great
many
incongruous
people
to
dinner
on
the
same
day
.
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
Mr
Dombey
produced
a
list
of
sundry
eastern
magnates
who
were
to
be
bidden
to
this
feast
on
his
behalf
;
to
which
Mrs
Skewton
,
acting
for
her
dearest
child
,
who
was
haughtily
careless
on
the
subject
,
subjoined
a
western
list
,
comprising
Cousin
Feenix
,
not
yet
returned
to
Baden
-
Baden
,
greatly
to
the
detriment
of
his
personal
estate
;
and
a
variety
of
moths
of
various
degrees
and
ages
,
who
had
,
at
various
times
,
fluttered
round
the
light
of
her
fair
daughter
,
or
herself
,
without
any
lasting
injury
to
their
wings
.
<EOS>
Florence
was
enrolled
as
a
member
of
the
dinner
-
party
,
by
Edith
's
command
---
elicited
by
a
moment
's
doubt
and
hesitation
on
the
part
of
Mrs
Skewton
;
and
Florence
,
with
a
wondering
heart
,
and
with
a
quick
instinctive
sense
of
everything
that
grated
on
her
father
in
the
least
,
took
her
silent
share
in
the
proceedings
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
The
proceedings
commenced
by
Mr
Dombey
,
in
a
cravat
of
extraordinary
height
and
stiffness
,
walking
restlessly
about
the
drawing
-
room
until
the
hour
appointed
for
dinner
;
punctual
to
which
,
an
East
India
Director
,
of
immense
wealth
,
in
a
waistcoat
apparently
constructed
in
serviceable
deal
by
some
plain
carpenter
,
but
really
engendered
in
the
tailor
's
art
,
and
composed
of
the
material
called
nankeen
,
arrived
and
was
received
by
Mr
Dombey
alone
.
<EOS>
The
next
stage
of
the
proceedings
was
Mr
Dombey
's
sending
his
compliments
to
Mrs
Dombey
,
with
a
correct
statement
of
the
time
;
and
the
next
,
the
East
India
Director
's
falling
prostrate
,
in
a
conversational
point
of
view
,
and
as
Mr
Dombey
was
not
the
man
to
pick
him
up
,
staring
at
the
fire
until
rescue
appeared
in
the
person
of
Mrs
Skewton
;
whom
the
director
,
as
a
pleasant
start
in
life
for
the
evening
,
mistook
for
Mrs
Dombey
,
and
greeted
with
enthusiasm
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
arrival
was
a
Bank
Director
,
reputed
to
be
able
to
buy
up
anything
---
human
Nature
generally
,
if
he
should
take
it
in
his
head
to
influence
the
money
market
in
that
direction
---
but
who
was
a
wonderfully
modest
-
spoken
man
,
almost
boastfully
so
,
and
mentioned
his
"
little
place
"
at
Kingston
-
uponThames
,
and
its
just
being
barely
equal
to
giving
Dombey
a
bed
and
a
chop
,
if
he
would
come
and
visit
it
.
<EOS>
Ladies
,
he
said
,
it
was
not
for
a
man
who
lived
in
his
quiet
way
to
take
upon
himself
to
invite
---
but
if
Mrs
Skewton
and
her
daughter
,
Mrs
Dombey
,
should
ever
find
themselves
in
that
direction
,
and
would
do
him
the
honour
to
look
at
a
little
bit
of
a
shrubbery
they
would
find
there
,
and
a
poor
little
flower
-
bed
or
so
,
and
a
humble
apology
for
a
pinery
,
and
two
or
three
little
attempts
of
that
sort
without
any
pretension
,
they
would
distinguish
him
very
much
.
<EOS>
Carrying
out
his
character
,
this
gentleman
was
very
plainly
dressed
,
in
a
wisp
of
cambric
for
a
neckcloth
,
big
shoes
,
a
coat
that
was
too
loose
for
him
,
and
a
pair
of
trousers
that
were
too
spare
;
and
mention
being
made
of
the
Opera
by
Mrs
Skewton
,
he
said
he
very
seldom
went
there
,
for
he
could
n't
afford
it
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
greatly
to
delight
and
exhilarate
him
to
say
so
:
and
he
beamed
on
his
audience
afterwards
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
excessive
satisfaction
twinkling
in
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
Now
Mrs
Dombey
appeared
,
beautiful
and
proud
,
and
as
disdainful
and
defiant
to
them
all
as
if
the
bridal
wreath
upon
her
head
had
been
a
garland
of
steel
spikes
put
on
to
force
concession
from
her
which
she
would
die
sooner
than
yield
.
<EOS>
With
her
was
Florence
.
<EOS>
When
they
entered
together
,
the
shadow
of
the
night
of
the
return
again
darkened
Mr
Dombey
's
face
.
<EOS>
But
unobserved
:
for
Florence
did
not
venture
to
raise
her
eyes
to
his
,
and
Edith
's
indifference
was
too
supreme
to
take
the
least
heed
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
arrivals
quickly
became
numerous
.
<EOS>
More
directors
,
chairmen
of
public
companies
,
elderly
ladies
carrying
burdens
on
their
heads
for
full
dress
,
Cousin
Feenix
,
Major
Bagstock
,
friends
of
Mrs
Skewton
,
with
the
same
bright
bloom
on
their
complexion
,
and
very
precious
necklaces
on
very
withered
necks
.
<EOS>
Among
these
,
a
young
lady
of
sixty
-
five
,
remarkably
coolly
dressed
as
to
her
back
and
shoulders
,
who
spoke
with
an
engaging
lisp
,
and
whose
eyelids
would
n't
keep
up
well
,
without
a
great
deal
of
trouble
on
her
part
,
and
whose
manners
had
that
indefinable
charm
which
so
frequently
attaches
to
the
giddiness
of
youth
.
<EOS>
As
the
greater
part
of
Mr
Dombey
's
list
were
disposed
to
be
taciturn
,
and
the
greater
part
of
Mrs
Dombey
's
list
were
disposed
to
be
talkative
,
and
there
was
no
sympathy
between
them
,
Mrs
Dombey
's
list
,
by
magnetic
agreement
,
entered
into
a
bond
of
union
against
Mr
Dombey
's
list
,
who
,
wandering
about
the
rooms
in
a
desolate
manner
,
or
seeking
refuge
in
corners
,
entangled
themselves
with
company
coming
in
,
and
became
barricaded
behind
sofas
,
and
had
doors
opened
smartly
from
without
against
their
heads
,
and
under
went
every
sort
of
discomfiture
.
  
<EOS>
When
dinner
was
announced
,
Mr
Dombey
took
down
an
old
lady
like
a
crimson
velvet
pincushion
stuffed
with
bank
notes
,
who
might
have
been
the
identical
old
lady
of
Threadneedle
Street
,
she
was
so
rich
,
and
looked
so
unaccommodating
;
Cousin
Feenix
took
down
Mrs
Dombey
;
Major
Bagstock
took
down
Mrs
Skewton
;
the
young
thing
with
the
shoulders
was
bestowed
,
as
an
extinguisher
,
upon
the
East
India
Director
;
and
the
remaining
ladies
were
left
on
view
in
the
drawing
-
room
by
remaining
gentlemen
,
until
a
forlorn
hope
volunteered
to
conduct
them
downstairs
,
and
those
brave
spirits
with
their
captives
blocked
up
the
dining
-
room
door
,
shutting
out
seven
mild
men
in
the
stony
-
hearted
hall
.
<EOS>
When
all
the
rest
were
got
in
and
were
seated
,
one
of
these
mild
men
still
appeared
,
in
smiling
confusion
,
totally
destitute
and
unprovided
for
,
and
escorted
by
the
butler
,
made
the
complete
circuit
of
the
table
twice
before
his
chair
could
be
found
,
which
it
finally
was
,
on
Mrs
Dombey
's
left
hand
;
after
which
the
mild
man
never
held
up
his
head
again
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
the
spacious
dining
-
room
,
with
the
company
seated
round
the
glittering
table
,
busy
with
their
glittering
spoons
,
and
knives
and
forks
,
and
plates
,
might
have
been
taken
for
a
grown
-
up
exposition
of
Tom
Tiddler
's
ground
,
where
children
pick
up
gold
and
silver
.
<EOS>
MrDombey
,
as
Tiddler
,
looked
his
character
to
admiration
;
and
the
long
plateau
of
precious
metal
frosted
,
separating
him
from
Mrs
Dombey
,
whereon
frosted
Cupids
offered
scentless
flowers
to
each
of
them
,
<EOS>
was
allegorical
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
Cousin
Feenix
was
in
great
force
,
and
looked
astonishingly
young
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
sometimes
thoughtless
in
his
good
humour
---
his
memory
occasionally
wandering
like
his
legs
---
and
on
this
occasion
caused
the
company
to
shudder
.
<EOS>
It
happened
thus
.
<EOS>
The
young
lady
with
the
back
,
who
regarded
Cousin
Feenix
with
sentiments
of
tenderness
,
had
entrapped
the
East
India
Director
into
leading
her
to
the
Chair
next
him
;
in
return
for
which
good
office
,
she
immediately
abandoned
the
Director
,
who
,
being
shaded
on
the
other
side
by
a
gloomy
black
velvet
hat
surmounting
a
bony
and
speechless
female
with
a
fan
,
yielded
to
a
depression
of
spirits
and
withdrew
into
himself
.
<EOS>
Cousin
Feenix
and
the
young
lady
were
very
lively
and
humorous
,
and
the
young
lady
laughed
so
much
at
something
Cousin
Feenix
related
to
her
,
that
Major
Bagstock
begged
leave
to
inquire
on
behalf
of
Mrs
Skewton
<EOS>
(
they
were
sitting
opposite
,
a
little
lower
down
)
,
whether
that
might
not
be
considered
public
property
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
upon
my
life
,
"
said
Cousin
Feenix
,
"
there
's
nothing
in
it
;
it
really
is
not
worth
repeating
;
in
point
of
fact
,
it
's
merely
an
anecdote
of
Jack
Adams
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
my
friend
Dombey
;
"
for
the
general
attention
was
concentrated
on
Cousin
Feenix
;
"
may
remember
Jack
Adams
,
Jack
Adams
,
not
Joe
;
that
was
his
brother
.
<EOS>
Jack
---
little
Jack
---
man
with
a
cast
in
his
eye
,
and
slight
impediment
in
his
speech
---
man
who
sat
for
somebody
's
borough
.
<EOS>
We
used
to
call
him
in
my
parliamentary
time
W
P
Adams
,
in
consequence
of
his
being
Warming
Pan
for
a
young
fellow
who
was
in
his
minority
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
my
friend
Dombey
may
have
known
the
man
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
who
was
as
likely
to
have
known
Guy
Fawkes
,
replied
in
the
negative
.
<EOS>
But
one
of
the
seven
mild
men
unexpectedly
leaped
into
distinction
,
by
saying
he
had
known
him
,
and
adding
---
"
always
wore
Hessian
boots
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
,
"
said
Cousin
Feenix
,
bending
forward
to
see
the
mild
man
,
and
smile
encouragement
at
his
down
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
Jack
.
<EOS>
Joe
wore
---
"
  
"
Tops
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
mild
man
,
rising
in
public
estimation
every
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
said
Cousin
Feenix
,
"
you
were
intimate
with
'
em
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
them
both
,
"
said
the
mild
man
.
<EOS>
With
whom
Mr
Dombey
immediately
took
wine
.
  
<EOS>
"
Devilish
good
fellow
,
Jack
!
"
said
Cousin
Feenix
,
again
bending
forward
,
and
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Excellent
,
"
returned
the
mild
man
,
becoming
bold
on
his
success
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
One
of
the
best
fellows
I
ever
knew
.
"
  
"
No
doubt
you
have
heard
the
story
?
"
said
Cousin
Feenix
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
know
,
"
replied
the
bold
mild
man
,
"
when
I
have
heard
your
Ludship
tell
it
.
<EOS>
"
With
that
,
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
smiled
at
the
ceiling
,
as
knowing
it
by
heart
,
and
being
already
tickled
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
point
of
fact
,
it
's
nothing
of
a
story
in
itself
,
"
said
Cousin
Feenix
,
addressing
the
table
with
a
smile
,
and
a
gay
shake
of
his
head
,
"
and
not
worth
a
word
of
preface
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
illustrative
of
the
neatness
of
Jack
's
humour
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
that
Jack
was
invited
down
to
a
marriage
---
which
I
think
took
place
in
Barkshire
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shropshire
,
"
said
the
bold
mild
man
,
finding
himself
appealed
to
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
?
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
In
point
of
fact
it
might
have
been
in
any
shire
,
"
said
Cousin
Feenix
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
my
friend
being
invited
down
to
this
marriage
in
Anyshire
,
"
with
a
pleasant
sense
of
the
readiness
of
this
joke
,
"
goes
.
<EOS>
Just
as
some
of
us
,
having
had
the
honour
of
being
invited
to
the
marriage
of
my
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
with
my
friend
Dombey
,
did
n't
require
to
be
asked
twice
,
and
were
devilish
glad
to
be
present
on
so
interesting
an
occasion
.
<EOS>
---
Goes
---
Jack
goes
.
<EOS>
Now
,
this
marriage
was
,
in
point
of
fact
,
the
marriage
of
an
uncommonly
fine
girl
with
a
man
for
whom
she
did
n't
care
a
button
,
but
whom
she
accepted
on
account
of
his
property
,
which
was
immense
.
<EOS>
When
Jack
returned
to
town
,
after
the
nuptials
,
a
man
he
knew
,
meeting
him
in
the
lobby
of
the
House
of
Commons
,
says
,
"
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Jack
,
how
are
the
ill
-
matched
couple
?
"
<EOS>
"
Illmatched
,
"
says
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
perfectly
fair
and
equal
transaction
.
<EOS>
She
is
regularly
bought
,
and
you
may
take
your
oath
<EOS>
he
is
as
regularly
sold
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
In
his
full
enjoyment
of
this
culminating
point
of
his
story
,
the
shudder
,
which
had
gone
all
round
the
table
like
an
electric
spark
,
struck
Cousin
Feenix
,
and
he
stopped
.
<EOS>
Not
a
smile
occasioned
by
the
only
general
topic
of
conversation
broached
that
day
,
appeared
on
any
face
.
<EOS>
A
profound
silence
ensued
;
and
the
wretched
mild
man
,
who
had
been
as
innocent
of
any
real
foreknowledge
of
the
story
as
the
child
unborn
,
had
the
exquisite
misery
of
reading
in
every
eye
that
he
was
regarded
as
the
prime
mover
of
the
mischief
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
face
was
a
changeful
one
,
and
being
cast
in
its
mould
of
state
that
day
,
showed
litter
other
apprehension
of
the
story
,
if
any
,
than
that
which
he
expressed
when
he
said
solemnly
,
amidst
the
silence
,
that
it
was
"
Very
good
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
rapid
glance
from
Edith
towards
Florence
,
but
otherwise
she
remained
,
externally
,
impassive
and
unconscious
.
  
<EOS>
Through
the
various
stages
of
rich
meats
and
wines
,
continual
gold
and
silver
,
dainties
of
earth
,
air
,
fire
,
and
water
,
heaped
-
up
fruits
,
and
that
unnecessary
article
in
Mr
Dombey
's
banquets
---
ice
---
the
dinner
slowly
made
its
way
:
the
later
stages
being
achieved
to
the
sonorous
music
of
incessant
double
knocks
,
announcing
the
arrival
of
visitors
,
whose
portion
of
the
feast
was
limited
to
the
smell
thereof
.
<EOS>
When
Mrs
Dombey
rose
,
it
was
a
sight
to
see
her
lord
,
with
stiff
throat
and
erect
head
,
hold
the
door
open
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
ladies
;
and
to
see
how
she
swept
past
him
with
his
daughter
on
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
was
a
grave
sight
,
being
the
decanters
,
in
a
state
of
dignity
;
and
the
East
India
Director
was
a
forlorn
sight
near
the
unoccupied
end
of
the
table
,
in
a
state
of
solitude
;
and
the
Major
was
a
military
sight
,
relating
stories
of
the
Duke
of
York
to
six
of
the
seven
mild
men
(
the
ambitious
one
was
utterly
quenched
)
;
and
the
Bank
Director
was
a
lowly
sight
,
making
a
plan
of
his
little
attempt
at
a
pinery
,
with
dessertknives
,
for
a
group
of
admirers
;
and
Cousin
Feenix
was
a
thoughtful
sight
,
as
he
smoothed
his
long
wristbands
and
stealthily
adjusted
his
wig
.
<EOS>
But
all
these
sights
were
of
short
duration
,
being
speedily
broken
up
by
coffee
,
and
the
desertion
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
throng
in
the
state
-
rooms
upstairs
,
increasing
every
minute
;
but
still
Mr
Dombey
's
list
of
visitors
appeared
to
have
some
native
impossibility
of
amalgamation
with
Mrs
Dombey
's
list
,
and
no
one
could
have
doubted
which
was
which
.
<EOS>
The
single
exception
to
this
rule
perhaps
was
Mr
Carker
,
who
now
smiled
among
the
company
,
and
who
,
as
he
stood
in
the
circle
that
was
gathered
about
Mrs
Dombey
---
watchful
of
her
,
of
them
,
his
chief
,
Cleopatra
and
the
Major
,
Florence
,
and
everything
around
---
appeared
at
ease
with
both
divisions
of
guests
,
and
not
marked
as
exclusively
belonging
to
either
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
had
a
dread
of
him
,
which
made
his
presence
in
the
room
a
nightmare
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
avoid
the
recollection
of
it
,
for
her
eyes
were
drawn
towards
him
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
by
an
attraction
of
dislike
and
distrust
that
she
could
not
resist
.
<EOS>
Yet
her
thoughts
were
busy
with
other
things
;
for
as
she
sat
apart
---
not
unadmired
or
unsought
,
but
in
the
gentleness
of
her
quiet
spirit
---
she
felt
how
little
part
her
father
had
in
what
was
going
on
,
and
saw
,
with
pain
,
how
ill
at
ease
he
seemed
to
be
,
and
how
little
regarded
he
was
as
he
lingered
about
near
the
door
,
for
those
visitors
whom
he
wished
to
distinguish
with
particular
attention
,
and
took
them
up
to
introduce
them
to
his
wife
,
who
received
them
with
proud
coldness
,
but
showed
no
interest
or
wish
to
please
,
and
never
,
after
the
bare
ceremony
of
reception
,
in
consultation
of
his
wishes
,
or
in
welcome
of
his
friends
,
opened
her
lips
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
less
perplexing
or
painful
to
Florence
,
that
she
who
acted
thus
,
treated
her
so
kindly
and
with
such
loving
consideration
,
that
it
almost
seemed
an
ungrateful
return
on
her
part
even
to
know
of
what
was
passing
before
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
Happy
Florence
would
have
been
,
might
she
have
ventured
to
bear
her
father
company
,
by
so
much
as
a
look
:
and
happy
Florence
was
,
in
little
suspecting
the
main
cause
of
his
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
But
afraid
of
seeming
to
know
that
he
was
placed
at
any
disadvantage
,
lest
he
should
be
resentful
of
that
knowledge
;
and
divided
between
her
impulse
towards
him
,
and
her
grateful
affection
for
Edith
<EOS>
;
she
scarcely
dared
to
raise
her
eyes
towards
either
.
<EOS>
Anxious
and
unhappy
for
them
both
<EOS>
,
the
thought
stole
on
her
through
the
crowd
,
that
it
might
have
been
better
for
them
if
this
noise
of
tongues
and
tread
of
feet
had
never
come
there
,
---
if
the
old
dulness
and
decay
had
never
been
replaced
by
novelty
and
splendour
,
---
if
the
neglected
child
had
found
no
friend
in
Edith
,
but
had
lived
her
solitary
life
,
unpitied
and
forgotten
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
had
some
such
thoughts
too
,
but
they
were
not
so
quietly
developed
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
This
good
matron
had
been
outraged
in
the
first
instance
by
not
receiving
an
invitation
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
That
blow
partially
recovered
,
she
had
gone
to
a
vast
expense
to
make
such
a
figure
before
Mrs
Dombey
at
home
,
as
should
dazzle
the
senses
of
that
lady
,
and
heap
mortification
,
mountains
high
,
on
the
head
of
Mrs
Skewton
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
made
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
to
Mr
Chick
,
"
of
no
more
account
than
Florence
!
<EOS>
Who
takes
the
smallest
notice
of
me
?
<EOS>
No
one
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
one
,
my
dear
,
"
assented
Mr
Chick
,
who
was
seated
by
the
side
of
Mrs
Chick
against
the
wall
,
and
could
console
himself
,
even
there
,
by
softly
whistling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
it
at
all
appear
as
if
I
was
wanted
here
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Chick
,
with
flashing
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
,
I
do
n't
think
it
does
,
"
said
Mr
Chick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Paul
's
mad
!
"
said
Mrs
Chick
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Chick
whistled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Unless
you
are
a
monster
,
which
I
sometimes
think
you
are
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
with
candour
,
"
do
n't
sit
there
humming
tunes
.
<EOS>
How
any
one
with
the
most
distant
feelings
of
a
man
,
can
see
that
mother
-
in
-
law
of
Paul

,
dressed
as
she
is
,
going
on
like
that
,
with
Major
Bagstock

for
whom
,
among
other
precious
things
,
we
are
indebted
to
your

My
Lucretia
Tox
,
my
dear
!
"
said
Mr
Chick
,
astounded
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
retorted
Mrs
Chick
,
with
great
severity
<EOS>
,
"
your
Lucretia
Tox
---
I
say
how
anybody
can
see
that
mother
-
in
-
law
of
Paul
's
,
and
that
haughty
wife
of
Paul
's
,
and
these
indecent
old
frights
with
their
backs
and
shoulders
,
and
in
short
this
at
home
generally
,
and
hum
---
,
"
on
which
word
Mrs
Chick
laid
a
scornful
emphasis
that
made
Mr
Chick
start
,
"
<EOS>
is
<EOS>
,
I
thank
Heaven
,
a
mystery
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Chick
screwed
his
mouth
into
a
form
irreconcilable
with
humming
or
whistling
,
and
looked
very
contemplative
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
hope
I
know
what
is
due
to
myself
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
swelling
with
indignation
,
"
though
Paul
has
forgotten
what
is
due
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
to
sit
here
,
a
member
of
this
family
,
to
be
taken
no
notice
of
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
the
dirt
under
Mrs
Dombey
's
feet
,
yet
---
not
quite
yet
,
"
said
Mrs
Chick
,
as
if
she
expected
to
become
so
,
about
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
shall
go
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
(
whatever
I
may
think
)
that
this
affair
has
been
got
up
solely
to
degrade
and
insult
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
merely
go
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
missed
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
rose
erect
with
these
words
,
and
took
the
arm
of
Mr
Chick
,
who
escorted
her
from
the
room
,
after
half
an
hour
's
shady
sojourn
there
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
due
to
her
penetration
to
observe
that
she
certainly
was
not
missed
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
was
not
the
only
indignant
guest
;
for
Mr
Dombey
's
list
(
still
constantly
in
difficulties
)
were
,
as
a
body
,
indignant
with
Mrs
Dombey
's
list
for
looking
at
them
through
eyeglasses
,
and
audibly
wondering
who
all
those
people
were
;
while
Mrs
Dombey
's
list
complained
of
weariness
,
and
the
young
thing
with
the
shoulders
,
deprived
of
the
attentions
of
that
gay
youth
Cousin
Feenix
(
who
went
away
from
the
dinnertable
)
,
confidentially
alleged
to
thirty
or
forty
friends
that
she
was
bored
to
death
.
<EOS>
All
the
old
ladies
with
the
burdens
on
their
heads
,
had
greater
or
less
cause
of
complaint
against
Mrs
Dombey
;
and
the
Directors
and
Chairmen
coincided
in
thinking
that
if
Dombey
must
marry
,
he
had
better
have
married
somebody
nearer
his
own
age
,
not
quite
so
handsome
,
and
a
little
better
off
.
<EOS>
The
general
opinion
among
this
class
of
gentlemen
was
,
that
it
was
a
weak
thing
in
Dombey
,
and
he
'd
live
to
repent
it
.
<EOS>
Hardly
anybody
there
,
except
the
mild
men
,
stayed
,
or
went
away
,
without
considering
himself
or
herself
neglected
and
aggrieved
by
Mr
Dombey
or
Mrs
Dombey
;
and
the
speechless
female
in
the
black
velvet
hat
was
found
to
have
been
stricken
mute
,
because
the
lady
in
the
crimson
velvet
had
been
handed
down
before
her
.
<EOS>
The
nature
even
of
the
mild
men
got
corrupted
,
either
from
their
curdling
it
with
too
much
lemonade
,
or
from
the
general
inoculation
that
prevailed
;
and
they
made
sarcastic
jokes
to
one
another
,
and
whispered
disparagement
on
stairs
and
in
bye
-
places
.
<EOS>
The
general
dissatisfaction
and
discomfort
so
diffused
itself
,
that
the
assembled
footmen
in
the
hall
were
as
well
acquainted
with
it
as
the
company
above
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
very
linkmen
outside
got
hold
of
it
,
and
compared
the
party
to
a
funeral
out
of
mourning
,
with
none
of
the
company
remembered
in
the
will
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
the
guests
were
all
gone
,
and
the
linkmen
too
;
and
the
street
,
crowded
so
long
with
carriages
,
was
clear
;
and
the
dying
lights
showed
no
one
in
the
rooms
,
but
Mr
Dombey
and
Mr
Carker
,
who
were
talking
together
apart
,
and
Mrs
Dombey
and
her
mother
:
the
former
seated
on
an
ottoman
;
the
latter
reclining
in
the
Cleopatra
attitude
,
awaiting
the
arrival
of
her
maid
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
having
finished
his
communication
to
Carker
,
the
latter
advanced
obsequiously
to
take
leave
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
trust
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
the
fatigues
of
this
delightful
evening
will
not
inconvenience
Mrs
Dombey
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Dombey
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
advancing
,
"
has
sufficiently
spared
herself
fatigue
,
to
relieve
you
from
any
anxiety
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
I
regret
to
say
,
Mrs
Dombey
,
that
I
could
have
wished
you
had
fatigued
yourself
a
little
more
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
with
a
supercilious
glance
,
that
it
seemed
not
worth
her
while
to
protract
,
and
turned
away
her
eyes
without
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
,
Madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
that
you
should
not
have
thought
it
your
duty
---
<EOS>
"
  
She
looked
at
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
duty
,
Madam
,
"
pursued
Mr
Dombey
,
"
to
have
received
my
friends
with
a
little
more
deference
.
<EOS>
Some
of
those
whom
you
have
been
pleased
to
slight
to
-
night
in
a
very
marked
manner
,
Mrs
Dombey
,
confer
a
distinction
upon
you
,
I
must
tell
you
,
in
any
visit
they
pay
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
that
there
is
some
one
here
?
<EOS>
"
she
returned
,
now
looking
at
him
steadily
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
Carker
!
<EOS>
I
beg
that
you
do
not
.
<EOS>
I
insist
that
you
do
not
,
"
cried
Mr
Dombey
,
stopping
that
noiseless
gentleman
in
his
withdrawal
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
,
Madam
,
as
you
know
,
possesses
my
confidence
.
<EOS>
He
is
as
well
acquainted
as
myself
with
the
subject
on
which
I
speak
.
<EOS>
I
beg
to
tell
you
,
for
your
information
,
Mrs
Dombey
,
that
I
consider
these
wealthy
and
important
persons
confer
a
distinction
upon
me
:
"
and
Mr
Dombey
drew
himself
up
,
as
having
now
rendered
them
of
the
highest
possible
importance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
,
"
she
repeated
,
bending
her
disdainful
,
steady
gaze
upon
him
,
"
do
you
know
that
there
is
some
one
here
,
Sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
entreat
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
stepping
forward
,
"
I
must
beg
,
I
must
demand
,
to
be
released
.
<EOS>
Slight
and
unimportant
as
this
difference
is
---
"
  
Mrs
Skewton
,
who
had
been
intent
upon
her
daughter
's
face
,
took
him
up
here
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
sweetest
Edith
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
my
dearest
Dombey
;
our
excellent
friend
Mr
Carker
,
for
so
I
am
sure
I
ought
to
mention
him
---
"
  
Mr
Carker
murmured
,
"
Too
much
honour
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
---
has
used
the
very
words
that
were
in
my
mind
,
and
that
I
have
been
dying
,
these
ages
,
for
an
opportunity
of
introducing
.
<EOS>
Slight
and
unimportant
!
<EOS>
My
sweetest
Edith
,
and
my
dearest
Dombey
,
do
we
not
know
that
any
difference
between
you
two
---
<EOS>
No
,
Flowers
;
not
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Flowers
was
the
maid
,
who
,
finding
gentlemen
present
,
retreated
with
precipitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
any
difference
between
you
two
,
"
resumed
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
with
the
Heart
you
possess
in
common
,
and
the
excessively
charming
bond
of
feeling
that
there
is
between
you
,
must
be
slight
and
unimportant
?
<EOS>
What
words
could
better
define
the
fact
?
<EOS>
None
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
am
glad
to
take
this
slight
occasion
---
this
trifling
occasion
,
that
is
so
replete
with
Nature
,
and
your
individual
characters
,
and
all
that
---
so
truly
calculated
to
bring
the
tears
into
a
parent
's
eyes
---
to
say
that
I
attach
no
importance
to
them
in
the
least
,
except
as
developing
these
minor
elements
of
Soul
;
and
that
,
unlike
most
mamas
-
inlaw
(
that
odious
phrase
,
dear
Dombey
!
)
<EOS>
as
they
have
been
represented
to
me
to
exist
in
this
<EOS>
I
fear
too
artificial
world
,
I
never
shall
attempt
to
interpose
between
you
,
at
such
a
time
,
and
never
can
much
regret
,
after
all
,
such
little
flashes
of
the
torch
of
What's
-
his
-
name
---
not
Cupid
,
but
the
other
delightful
creature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
sharpness
in
the
good
mother
's
glance
at
both
her
children
as
she
spoke
,
that
may
have
been
expressive
of
a
direct
and
well
-
considered
purpose
hidden
between
these
rambling
words
.
<EOS>
That
purpose
,
providently
to
detach
herself
in
the
beginning
from
all
the
clankings
of
their
chain
that
were
to
come
,
and
to
shelter
herself
with
the
fiction
of
her
innocent
belief
in
their
mutual
affection
,
and
their
adaptation
to
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
pointed
out
to
Mrs
Dombey
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
in
his
most
stately
manner
,
"
that
in
her
conduct
thus
early
in
our
married
life
,
to
which
I
object
,
and
which
,
I
request
,
may
be
corrected
.
<EOS>
Carker
,
"
with
a
nod
of
dismissal
,
"
good
night
to
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
bowed
to
the
imperious
form
of
the
Bride
,
whose
sparkling
eye
was
fixed
upon
her
husband
;
and
stopping
at
Cleopatra
's
couch
on
his
way
out
,
raised
to
his
lips
the
hand
she
graciously
extended
to
him
,
in
lowly
and
admiring
homage
.
  
<EOS>
If
his
handsome
wife
had
reproached
him
,
or
even
changed
countenance
,
or
broken
the
silence
in
which
she
remained
,
by
one
word
,
now
that
they
were
alone
(
for
Cleopatra
made
off
with
all
speed
)
,
Mr
Dombey
would
have
been
equal
to
some
assertion
of
his
case
against
her
.
<EOS>
But
the
intense
,
unutterable
,
withering
scorn
,
with
which
,
after
looking
upon
him
,
she
dropped
her
eyes
,
as
if
he
were
too
worthless
and
indifferent
to
her
to
be
challenged
with
a
syllable
---
the
ineffable
disdain
and
haughtiness
in
which
she
sat
before
him
---
<EOS>
the
cold
inflexible
resolve
with
which
her
every
feature
seemed
to
bear
him
down
,
and
put
him
by
---
these
<EOS>
,
he
had
no
resource
against
;
and
he
left
her
,
with
her
whole
overbearing
beauty
concentrated
on
despising
him
.
  
<EOS>
Was
he
coward
enough
to
watch
her
,
an
hour
afterwards
,
on
the
old
well
staircase
,
where
he
had
once
seen
Florence
in
the
moonlight
,
toiling
up
with
Paul
?
<EOS>
Or
was
he
in
the
dark
by
accident
,
when
,
looking
up
,
he
saw
her
coming
,
with
a
light
,
from
the
room
where
Florence
lay
,
and
marked
again
the
face
so
changed
,
which
he
could
not
subdue
?
  
<EOS>
But
it
could
never
alter
as
his
own
did
.
<EOS>
It
never
,
in
its
utmost
pride
and
passion
,
knew
the
shadow
that
had
fallen
on
his
,
in
the
dark
corner
,
on
the
night
of
the
return
;
and
often
since
;
and
which
deepened
on
it
now
as
he
looked
up
.

More

FLORENCE
,
Edith
,
and
Mrs
Skewton
were
together
next
day
,
and
the
carriage
was
waiting
at
the
door
to
take
them
out
.
<EOS>
For
Cleopatra
had
her
galley
again
now
,
and
Withers
,
no
longer
the
wan
,
stood
upright
in
a
pigeon
-
breasted
jacket
and
military
trousers
,
behind
her
wheel
-
less
chair
at
dinner
-
time
,
and
butted
no
more
.
<EOS>
The
hair
of
Withers
was
radiant
with
pomatum
,
in
these
days
of
down
,
and
he
wore
kid
gloves
and
smelt
of
the
water
of
Cologne
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
assembled
in
Cleopatra
's
room
.
<EOS>
The
Serpent
of
old
Nile
(
not
to
mention
her
disrespectfully
)
was
reposing
on
her
sofa
,
sipping
her
morning
chocolate
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
and
Flowers
the
Maid
was
fastening
on
her
youthful
cuffs
and
frills
,
and
performing
a
kind
of
private
coronation
ceremony
on
her
,
with
a
peach
-
coloured
velvet
bonnet
;
the
artificial
roses
in
which
nodded
to
uncommon
advantage
,
as
the
palsy
trifled
with
them
,
like
a
breeze
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
am
a
little
nervous
this
morning
,
Flowers
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
.
<EOS>
"
My
hand
quite
shakes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
the
life
of
the
party
last
night
,
<EOS>
Ma'am

you
know

returned
Flowers
,
"
and
you
suffer
for
it
,
to

day
,
you
see

"
  
<EOS>
Edith
,
who
had
beckoned
Florence
to
the
window
,
and
was
looking
out
,
with
her
back
turned
on
the
toilet
of
her
esteemed
mother
,
suddenly
withdrew
from
it
,
as
if
it
had
lightened
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
darling
child
,
"
cried
Cleopatra
,
languidly
,
"
you
are
not
nervous
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
tell
me
,
my
dear
Edith
,
that
you
,
so
enviably
self

possessed
,
are
beginning
to
be
a
martyr
too

your
unfortunately
constituted

Withers
,
some
one
at
the
door
.

<EOS>
"
Card
,
Ma'am

"
said
Withers
,
taking
it
towards
Mrs
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
out
,
"
she
said
without
looking
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
love
,
"
drawled
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
how
very
odd
to
send
that
message
without
seeing
the
name

<EOS>
Bring
it
here

Withers

<EOS>
Dear
me

my

Mr

<EOS>
That
very
sensible

<EOS>
"
I
am
going
out

"
repeated
Edith
,
in
so
imperious
a
tone
that
Withers
,
going
to
the
door
,
imperiously
informed
the
servant
who
was
waiting
,
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Dombey
is
going
out
.
<EOS>
Get
along
with
you
,
"
and
shut
it
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
servant
came
back
after
a
short
absence
,
and
whispered
to
Withers
again
,
who
once
more
,
and
not
very
willingly
,
presented
himself
before
Mrs
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
Ma'am
,
Mr
Carker
sends
his
respectful
compliments
,
and
begs
you
would
spare
him
one
minute
,
if
you
could
---
for
business
,
Ma'am
,
if
you
please

<EOS>
"
Really
,
my
love
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
in
her
mildest
manner
;
for
her
daughter
's
face
was
threatening
;
"
if
you
would
allow
me
to
offer
a
word
,
I
should
recommend
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
Show
him
this
way
,
"
said
Edith
.
<EOS>
As
Withers
disappeared
to
execute
the
command
,
she
added
,
frowning
on
her
mother
,
"
As
he
comes
at
your
recommendation
,
let
him
come
to
your
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
---
shall
I
go
away
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Florence
,
hurriedly
.
  
<EOS>
Edith
nodded
<EOS>
yes
,
but
on
her
way
to
the
door
Florence
met
the
visitor
coming
in
.
<EOS>
With
the
same
disagreeable
mixture
of
familiarity
and
forbearance
with
which
he
had
first
addressed
her
,
he
addressed
her
now
in
his
softest
manner
---
hoped
she
was
quite
well
---
needed
not
to
ask
,
with
such
looks
to
anticipate
the
answer
---
had
scarcely
had
the
honour
to
know
her
,
last
night
,
she
was
so
greatly
changed
---
and
held
the
door
open
for
her
to
pass
out
;
with
a
secret
sense
of
power
in
her
shrinking
from
him
,
that
all
the
deference
and
politeness
of
his
manner
could
not
quite
conceal
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
bowed
himself
for
a
moment
over
Mrs
Skewton
's
condescending
hand
,
and
lastly
bowed
to
Edith
.
<EOS>
Coldly
returning
his
salute
without
looking
at
him
,
and
neither
seating
herself
nor
inviting
him
to
be
seated
,
she
waited
for
him
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
Entrenched
in
her
pride
and
power
,
and
with
all
the
obduracy
of
her
spirit
summoned
about
her
,
still
her
old
conviction
that
she
and
her
mother
had
been
known
by
this
man
in
their
worst
colours
,
from
their
first
acquaintance
;
that
every
degradation
she
had
suffered
in
her
own
eyes
was
plain
to
him
as
to
herself
;
that
he
read
her
life
as
though
it
were
a
vile
book
,
and
fluttered
the
leaves
before
her
in
slight
looks
and
tones
of
voice
which
no
one
else
could
detect
;
weakened
and
undermined
her
.
<EOS>
Proudly
as
she
opposed
herself
to
him
,
with
her
commanding
face
exacting
his
humility
,
her
disdainful
lip
repulsing
him
,
her
bosom
angry
at
his
intrusion
,
and
the
dark
lashes
of
her
eyes
sullenly
veiling
their
light
,
that
no
ray
of
it
might
shine
upon
him
---
and
submissively
as
he
stood
before
her
,
with
an
entreating
injured
manner
,
but
with
complete
submission
to
her
will
---
she
knew
,
in
her
own
soul
,
that
the
cases
were
reversed
,
and
that
the
triumph
and
superiority
were
his
,
and
that
he
knew
it
full
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
presumed
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
"
to
solicit
an
interview
,
and
I
have
ventured
to
describe
it
as
being
one
of
business
,
because
---
"
  
"
Perhaps
you
are
charged
by
Mr
Dombey
with
some
message
of
reproof
,
"
said
Edith
.
<EOS>
"
You
possess
Mr
Dombey
's
confidence
in
such
an
unusual
degree
,
Sir
,
that
you
would
scarcely
surprise
me
if
that
were
your
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
message
to
the
lady
who
sheds
a
lustre
upon
his
name
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
entreat
that
lady
,
on
my
own
behalf
,
to
be
just
to
a
very
humble
claimant
for
justice
at
her
hands
---
a
mere
dependant
of
Mr
Dombey
's
---
which
is
a
position
of
humility
;
and
to
reflect
upon
my
perfect
helplessness
last
night
,
and
the
impossibility
of
my
avoiding
the
share
that
was
forced
upon
me
in
a
very
painful
occasion
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Edith
,
"
hinted
Cleopatra
in
a
low
voice
,
as
she
held
her
eye
-
glass
aside
,
"
<EOS>
really
very
charming
of
Mr
What'shis
-
name
.
<EOS>
And
full
of
heart
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
I
do
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
appealing
to
Mrs
Skewton
with
a
look
of
grateful
deference
,
---
<EOS>
"
I
do
venture
to
call
it
a
painful
occasion
,
though
merely
because
it
was
so
to
me
,
who
had
the
misfortune
to
be
present
.
<EOS>
So
light
a
difference
,
as
between
the
principals
---
between
those
who
love
each
other
with
disinterested
devotion
,
and
would
make
any
sacrifice
of
self
,
in
such
a
cause
---
is
nothing
.
<EOS>
As
Mrs
Skewton
herself
expressed
,
with
so
much
truth
and
feeling
last
night
,
it
is
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
could
not
look
at
him
,
but
she
said
after
a
few
moments
,
  
"
And
<EOS>
your
business
,
Sir
---
"
  
"
Edith
,
my
pet
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
all
this
time
Mr
Carker
is
standing
!
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr
Carker
,
take
a
seat
,
I
beg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
offered
no
reply
to
the
mother
,
but
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
proud
daughter
,
as
though
he
would
only
be
bidden
by
her
,
and
was
resolved
to
be
bidden
by
her
.
<EOS>
Edith
,
in
spite
of
herself
,
sat
down
,
and
slightly
motioned
with
her
hand
to
him
to
be
seated
too
.
<EOS>
No
action
could
be
colder
,
haughtier
,
more
insolent
in
its
air
of
supremacy
and
disrespect
,
but
she
had
struggled
against
even
that
concession
ineffectually
,
and
it
was
wrested
from
her
.
<EOS>
That
was
enough
!
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
sat
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
be
allowed
,
Madam
,
"
said
Carker
,
turning
his
white
teeth
on
Mrs
Skewton
like
a
light
---
<EOS>
"
a
lady
of
your
excellent
sense
and
quick
feeling
will
give
me
credit
,
for
good
reason
,
I
am
sure
---
to
address
what
I
have
to
say
,
to
Mrs
Dombey
,
and
to
leave
her
to
impart
it
to
you
who
are
her
best
and
dearest
friend
---
next
to
Mr
Dombey
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
would
have
retired
,
but
Edith
stopped
her
.
<EOS>
Edith
would
have
stopped
him
too
,
and
indignantly
ordered
him
to
speak
openly
or
not
at
all
,
but
that
he
said
,
in
a
low
voice
---
"
Miss
Florence
---
the
young
lady
who
has
just
left
the
room
---
"
  
Edith
suffered
him
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
now
.
<EOS>
As
he
bent
forward
,
to
be
nearer
,
with
the
utmost
show
of
delicacy
and
respect
,
and
with
his
teeth
persuasively
arrayed
,
in
a
selfdepreciating
smile
,
she
felt
as
if
she
could
have
struck
him
dead
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Florence
's
position
<EOS>
,
"
he
began
,
"
has
been
an
unfortunate
one
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
difficulty
in
alluding
to
it
to
you
,
whose
attachment
to
her
father
is
naturally
watchful
and
jealous
of
every
word
that
applies
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
Always
distinct
and
soft
in
speech
,
no
language
could
describe
the
extent
of
his
distinctness
and
softness
,
when
he
said
these
words
,
or
came
to
any
others
of
a
similar
import
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
as
one
who
is
devoted
to
Mr
Dombey
in
his
different
way
,
and
whose
life
is
passed
in
admiration
of
Mr
Dombey
's
character
,
may
I
say
,
without
offence
to
your
tenderness
as
a
wife
,
that
Miss
Florence
has
unhappily
been
neglected
---
by
her
father
?
<EOS>
May
I
say
by
her
father
?
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
replied
,
"
I
know
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
it
!
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
with
a
great
appearance
of
relief
.
<EOS>
"
It
removes
a
mountain
from
my
breast
.
<EOS>
May
I
hope
you
know
how
the
neglect
originated
;
in
what
an
amiable
phase
of
Mr
Dombey
's
pride
---
character
I
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
pass
that
by
,
Sir
,
"
she
returned
,
"
and
come
the
sooner
to
the
end
of
what
you
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Indeed
,
I
am
sensible
,
Madam
,
"
replied
Carker
,
---
"
trust
me
,
I
am
deeply
sensible
,
that
Mr
Dombey
can
require
no
justification
in
anything
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
,
kindly
judge
of
my
breast
by
your
own
,
and
you
will
forgive
my
interest
in
him
,
if
in
its
excess
,
it
goes
at
all
astray
.
"
  
<EOS>
What
a
stab
to
her
proud
heart
,
to
sit
there
,
face
to
face
with
him
,
and
have
him
tendering
her
false
oath
at
the
altar
again
and
again
for
her
acceptance
,
and
pressing
it
upon
her
like
the
dregs
of
a
sickening
cup
<EOS>
she
could
not
own
her
loathing
of
,
or
turn
away
from
!
<EOS>
How
shame
,
remorse
,
and
passion
raged
within
her
,
when
,
upright
and
majestic
in
her
beauty
before
him
,
she
knew
that
in
her
spirit
she
was
down
at
his
feet
!
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Florence
,
"
said
Carker
,
"
left
to
the
care
---
if
one
may
call
it
care
---
of
servants
and
mercenary
people
,
in
every
way
her
inferiors
,
necessarily
wanted
some
guide
and
compass
in
her
younger
days
,
and
,
naturally
,
for
want
of
them
,
has
been
indiscreet
,
and
has
in
some
degree
forgotten
her
station
.
<EOS>
There
was
some
folly
about
one
Walter
,
a
common
lad
,
who
is
fortunately
dead
now
:
and
some
very
undesirable
association
,
I
regret
to
say
,
with
certain
coasting
sailors
,
of
anything
but
good
repute
,
and
a
runaway
old
bankrupt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
the
circumstances
,
Sir
,
"
said
Edith
,
flashing
her
disdainful
glance
upon
him
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
know
that
you
pervert
them
.
<EOS>
You
may
not
know
it
,
I
hope
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
"
I
believe
that
nobody
knows
them
so
well
as
I.
Your
generous
and
ardent
nature
,
Madam
---
the
same
nature
which
is
so
nobly
imperative
in
vindication
of
your
beloved
and
honoured
husband
,
and
which
has
blessed
him
as
even
his
merits
deserve
<EOS>
---
I
must
respect
,
defer
to
,
bow
before
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
regards
the
circumstances
,
which
is
indeed
the
business
I
presumed
to
solicit
your
attention
to
,
I
can
have
no
doubt
,
since
,
in
the
execution
of
my
trust
as
Mr
Dombey
's
confidential
---
I
presume
to
say

friend
,
I
have
fully
ascertained
them
.
<EOS>
In
my
execution
of
that
trust
;
in
my
deep
concern
,
which
you
can
so
well
understand
,
for
everything
relating
to
him
,
intensified
,
if
you
will
(
for
I
fear
I
labour
under
your
displeasure
)
,
by
the
lower
motive
of
desire
to
prove
my
diligence
,
and
make
myself
the
more
acceptable
;
I
have
long
pursued
these
circumstances
by
myself
and
trustworthy
instruments
,
and
have
innumerable
and
most
minute
proofs
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
raised
her
eyes
no
higher
than
his
mouth
,
but
she
saw
the
means
of
mischief
vaunted
in
every
tooth
it
contained
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
Madam
<EOS>
,
"
he
continued
,
"
if
in
my
perplexity
,
I
presume
to
take
counsel
with
you
,
and
to
consult
your
pleasure
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
observed
that
you
are
greatly
interested
in
Miss
Florence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
was
there
in
her
he
had
not
observed
,
and
did
not
know
?
<EOS>
Humbled
and
yet
maddened
by
the
thought
,
in
every
new
presentment
of
it
<EOS>
,
however
faint
,
she
pressed
her
teeth
upon
her
quivering
lip
to
force
composure
on
it
,
and
distantly
inclined
her
head
in
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
interest
,
Madam
---
so
touching
an
evidence
of
everything
associated
with
Mr
Dombey
being
dear
to
you
---
induces
me
to
pause
before
I
make
him
acquainted
with
these
circumstances
,
which
,
as
yet
,
he
does
not
know
.
<EOS>
It
so
far
shakes
me
,
if
I
may
make
the
confession
,
in
my
allegiance
,
that
on
the
intimation
of
the
least
desire
to
that
effect
from
you
,
I
would
suppress
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
raised
her
head
quickly
,
and
starting
back
,
bent
her
dark
glance
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
met
it
with
his
blandest
and
most
deferential
smile
,
and
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
that
as
I
describe
them
,
they
are
perverted
.
<EOS>
I
fear
not
---
I
fear
not
:
but
let
us
assume
that
they
are
.
<EOS>
The
uneasiness
I
have
for
some
time
felt
on
the
subject
,
arises
in
this
:
that
the
mere
circumstance
of
such
association
often
repeated
,
on
the
part
of
Miss
Florence
,
however
innocently
and
confidingly
,
would
be
conclusive
with
Mr
Dombey
,
already
predisposed
against
her
,
and
would
lead
him
to
take
some
step
<EOS>
(
I
know
he
has
occasionally
contemplated
it
)
of
separation
and
alienation
of
her
from
his
home
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
bear
with
me
,
and
remember
my
intercourse
with
Mr
Dombey
,
and
my
knowledge
of
him
,
and
my
reverence
for
him
,
almost
from
childhood
,
when
I
say
that
if
he
has
a
fault
,
it
is
a
lofty
stubbornness
,
rooted
in
that
noble
pride
and
sense
of
power
which
belong
to
him
,
and
which
we
must
all
defer
to
;
which
is
not
assailable
like
the
obstinacy
of
other
characters
;
and
which
grows
upon
itself
from
day
to
day
,
and
year
to
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
bent
her
glance
upon
him
still
;
but
,
look
as
steadfast
as
she
would
,
her
haughty
nostrils
dilated
,
and
her
breath
came
somewhat
deeper
,
and
her
lip
would
slightly
curl
,
as
he
described
that
in
his
patron
to
which
they
must
all
bow
down
.
<EOS>
He
saw
it
;
and
though
his
expression
did
not
change
,
she
knew
he
saw
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Even
so
slight
an
incident
as
last
night
's
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
"
if
I
might
refer
to
it
once
more
,
would
serve
to
illustrate
my
meaning
,
better
than
a
greater
one
.
<EOS>
Dombey
and
Son
know
neither
time
,
nor
place
,
nor
season
,
but
bear
them
all
down
.
<EOS>
But
I
rejoice
in
its
occurrence
,
for
it
has
opened
the
way
for
me
to
approach
Mrs
Dombey
with
this
subject
to
-
day
,
even
if
it
has
entailed
upon
me
the
penalty
of
her
temporary
displeasure
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
in
the
midst
of
my
uneasiness
and
apprehension
on
this
subject
,
I
was
summoned
by
Mr
Dombey
to
Leamington
.
<EOS>
There
I
saw
you
.
<EOS>
There
I
could
not
help
knowing
what
relation
you
would
shortly
occupy
towards
him
---
to
his
enduring
happiness
and
yours
.
<EOS>
There
I
resolved
to
await
the
time
of
your
establishment
at
home
here
,
and
to
do
as
I
have
now
done
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
at
heart
,
no
fear
that
I
shall
be
wanting
in
my
duty
to
Mr
Dombey
,
<EOS>
if
I
bury
what
I
know
in
your
breast
;
for
where
there
is
but
one
heart
and
mind
between
two
persons
---
as
in
such
a
marriage
---
one
almost
represents
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
can
acquit
my
conscience
therefore
,
almost
equally
,
by
confidence
,
on
such
a
theme
,
in
you
or
him
.
<EOS>
For
the
reasons
I
have
mentioned
I
would
select
you
.
<EOS>
May
I
aspire
to
the
distinction
of
believing
that
my
confidence
is
accepted
,
and
that
I
am
relieved
from
my
responsibility
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
long
remembered
the
look
she
gave
him
---
who
could
see
it
,
and
forget
it
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
the
struggle
that
ensued
within
her
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
said
:
  
"
I
accept
it
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
You
will
please
to
consider
this
matter
at
an
end
,
and
that
it
goes
no
farther
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
bowed
low
,
and
rose
.
<EOS>
She
rose
too
,
and
he
took
leave
with
all
humility
.
<EOS>
But
Withers
,
meeting
him
on
the
stairs
,
stood
amazed
at
the
beauty
of
his
teeth
,
and
at
his
brilliant
smile
;
and
as
he
rode
away
upon
his
white
-
legged
horse
,
the
people
took
him
for
a
dentist
,
<EOS>
such
was
the
dazzling
show
he
made
.
<EOS>
The
people
took
her
,
when
she
rode
out
in
her
carriage
presently
,
for
a
great
lady
,
as
happy
as
she
was
rich
and
fine
.
<EOS>
But
they
had
not
seen
her
,
just
before
,
in
her
own
room
with
no
one
by
;
and
they
had
not
heard
her
utterance
of
the
three
words
,
"
Oh
Florence
,
Florence
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
,
reposing
on
her
sofa
,
and
sipping
her
chocolate
,
had
heard
nothing
but
the
low
word
business
,
for
which
she
had
a
mortal
aversion
,
insomuch
that
she
had
long
banished
it
from
her
vocabulary
,
and
had
gone
nigh
,
in
a
charming
manner
and
with
an
immense
amount
of
heart
,
to
say
nothing
of
soul
,
to
ruin
divers
milliners
and
others
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
Therefore
Mrs
Skewton
asked
no
questions
,
and
showed
no
curiosity
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
peach
-
velvet
bonnet
gave
her
sufficient
occupation
out
of
doors
;
for
being
perched
on
the
back
of
her
head
,
and
the
day
being
rather
windy
,
it
was
frantic
to
escape
from
Mrs
Skewton
's
company
,
and
would
be
coaxed
into
no
sort
of
compromise
.
<EOS>
When
the
carriage
was
closed
,
and
the
wind
shut
out
,
the
palsy
played
among
the
artificial
roses
again
like
an
almshouse
-
full
of
superannuated
zephyrs
;
and
altogether
Mrs
Skewton
had
enough
to
do
,
and
got
on
but
indifferently
.
  
<EOS>
She
got
on
no
better
towards
night
;
for
when
Mrs
Dombey
,
in
her
dressing
-
room
,
had
been
dressed
and
waiting
for
her
half
an
hour
,
and
Mr
Dombey
,
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
had
paraded
himself
into
a
state
of
solemn
fretfulness
(
they
were
all
three
going
out
to
dinner
)
,
<EOS>
Flowers
the
Maid
appeared
with
a
pale
face
to
Mrs
Dombey
,
saying
:
  
"
If
you
please
,
Ma'am
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
but
I
ca
n't
do
nothing
with
missis
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
asked
Edith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Ma'am
,
"
replied
the
frightened
maid
,
"
I
hardly
know
.
<EOS>
She
's
making
faces
!
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
hurried
with
her
to
her
mother
's
room
.
<EOS>
Cleopatra
was
arrayed
in
full
dress
,
with
the
diamonds
,
short
sleeves
,
rouge
,
curls
,
teeth
,
and
other
juvenility
all
complete
;
but
Paralysis
was
not
to
be
deceived
,
had
known
her
for
the
object
of
its
errand
,
and
had
struck
her
at
her
glass
,
where
she
lay
like
a
horrible
doll
that
had
tumbled
down
.
  
<EOS>
They
took
her
to
pieces
in
very
shame
,
and
put
the
little
of
her
that
was
real
on
a
bed
.
<EOS>
Doctors
were
sent
for
,
and
soon
came
.
<EOS>
Powerful
remedies
were
resorted
to
;
opinions
given
that
she
would
rally
from
this
shock
,
but
would
not
survive
another
;
and
there
she
lay
speechless
,
and
staring
at
the
ceiling
for
days
;
sometimes
making
inarticulate
sounds
in
answer
to
such
questions
as
did
she
know
who
were
present
,
and
the
like
:
sometimes
giving
no
reply
either
by
sign
or
gesture
,
or
in
her
unwinking
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
she
began
to
recover
consciousness
,
and
in
some
degree
the
power
of
motion
,
though
not
yet
of
speech
.
<EOS>
One
day
the
use
of
her
right
hand
returned
;
and
showing
it
to
her
maid
who
was
in
attendance
on
her
,
and
appearing
very
uneasy
in
her
mind
,
she
made
signs
for
a
pencil
and
some
paper
.
<EOS>
This
the
maid
immediately
provided
,
thinking
she
was
going
to
make
a
will
,
or
write
some
last
request
;
and
Mrs
Dombey
being
from
home
,
the
maid
awaited
the
result
with
solemn
feelings
.
  
<EOS>
After
much
painful
scrawling
and
erasing
,
and
putting
in
of
wrong
characters
,
which
seemed
to
tumble
out
of
the
pencil
of
their
own
accord
,
the
old
woman
produced
this
document
:
  
"
Rose
-
coloured
curtains
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
maid
being
perfectly
transfixed
,
and
with
tolerable
reason
,
Cleopatra
amended
the
manuscript
by
adding
two
words
more
,
when
it
stood
thus
:
  
"
Rose
-
coloured
curtains
for
doctors
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
maid
now
perceived
remotely
that
she
wished
these
articles
to
be
provided
for
the
better
presentation
of
her
complexion
to
the
faculty
;
and
as
those
in
the
house
who
knew
her
best
,
had
no
doubt
of
the
correctness
of
this
opinion
,
which
she
was
soon
able
to
establish
for
herself
,
the
rose
-
coloured
curtains
were
added
to
her
bed
,
and
she
mended
with
increased
rapidity
from
that
hour
.
<EOS>
She
was
soon
able
to
sit
up
,
in
curls
and
a
laced
cap
and
night
-
gown
,
and
to
have
a
little
artificial
bloom
dropped
into
the
hollow
caverns
of
her
cheeks
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
tremendous
sight
to
see
this
old
woman
in
her
finery
leering
and
mincing
at
Death
,
and
playing
off
her
youthful
tricks
upon
him
as
if
he
had
been
the
Major
;
but
an
alteration
in
her
mind
that
ensued
on
the
paralytic
stroke
was
fraught
with
as
much
matter
for
reflection
,
and
was
quite
as
ghastly
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
the
weakening
of
her
intellect
made
her
more
cunning
and
false
than
before
,
or
whether
it
confused
her
between
what
she
had
assumed
to
be
and
what
she
really
had
been
,
or
whether
it
had
awakened
any
glimmering
of
remorse
,
which
could
neither
struggle
into
light
nor
get
back
into
total
darkness
,
or
whether
,
in
the
jumble
of
her
faculties
,
a
combination
of
these
effects
had
been
shaken
up
,
which
is
perhaps
the
more
likely
supposition
,
the
result
was
this
:
---
That
she
became
hugely
exacting
in
respect
of
Edith
's
affection
and
gratitude
and
attention
to
her
;
highly
laudatory
of
herself
as
a
most
inestimable
parent
;
and
very
jealous
of
having
any
rival
in
Edith
's
regard
.
<EOS>
Further
,
in
place
of
remembering
that
compact
made
between
them
for
an
avoidance
of
the
subject
,
she
constantly
alluded
to
her
daughter
's
marriage
as
a
proof
of
her
being
an
incomparable
mother
;
and
all
this
,
with
the
weakness
and
peevishness
of
such
a
state
,
always
serving
for
a
sarcastic
commentary
on
her
levity
and
youthfulness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Mrs
Dombey
?
<EOS>
"
she
would
say
to
her
maid
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gone
out
,
Ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

"
La
bless
you

no
,
Ma'am

Mrs
Dombey
has
only
gone
out
for
a
ride
with
Miss
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Florence
.
<EOS>
Who
's
Miss
Florence
?
<EOS>
Do

me
about

Florence

What
's
Miss
Florence
to
her
,
compared
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
apposite
display
of
the
diamonds
,
or
the
peach
-
velvet
bonnet
(
she
sat
in
the
bonnet
to
receive
visitors
,
weeks
before
she
could
stir
out
of
doors
)
,
or
the
dressing
of
her
up
in
some
gaud
or
other
,
usually
stopped
the
tears
that
began
to
flow
hereabouts
;
and
she
would
remain
in
a
complacent
state
until
Edith
came
to
see
her
;
when
,
at
a
glance
of
the
proud
face
,
she
would
relapse
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
am
sure
,
Edith
!
"
<EOS>
she
would
cry
,
shaking
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
,
mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Matter

<EOS>
I
really
do
n't
know
what
is
the
matter
.
<EOS>
The
world
is
coming
to
such
an
artificial
and
ungrateful
state
,
that
I
begin
to
think
there
's
no
Heart

or
anything
of
that
sort
---
left
in
it

positively
.

Withers
is
more
a
child
to
me
than
you
are
.
<EOS>
He
attends
to
me
much
more
than
my
own
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
almost
wish
I
did
n't
look
so
young
---
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
---
and
then
perhaps
I
should
be
more
considered

"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh

impatiently

making
you
a
companion

no

not

all
this

<EOS>
"
You

"
Then
put
your
arms
round
my
neck
,
and
kiss
me
;
and
show
me
,
Edith

that
you
know
there

out

no

Major

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
sometimes
,
when
Edith
went
nearer
to
her
,
and
bending
down
her
stately
head
,
put
her
cold
cheek
to
hers
,
the
mother
would
draw
back
as
if
she
were
afraid
of
her
,
and
would
fall
into
a
fit
of
trembling
,
and
cry
out
that
there
was
a
wandering
in
her
wits
.
<EOS>
And
sometimes
she
would
entreat
her
,
with
humility
,
to
sit
down
on
the
chair
beside
her
bed
,
and
would
look
at
her
(
as
she
sat
there
brooding
)
with
a
face
that
even
the
rosecoloured
curtains
could
not
make
otherwise
than
seared
and
wild
.
  
<EOS>
The
rose
-
coloured
curtains
blushed
,
in
course
of
time
,
on
Cleopatra
's
bodily
recovery
,
and
on
her
dress
---
more
juvenile
than
ever
to
repair
the
ravages
of
illness
---
and
on
the
rouge
,
and
on
the
teeth
,
and
on
the
curls
,
and
on
the
diamonds
,
and
the
short
sleeves
,
and
the
whole
wardrobe
of
the
doll
that
had
tumbled
down
before
the
mirror
.
<EOS>
They
blushed
,
too
,
now
and
then
,
upon
an
indistinctness
in
her
speech
which
she
turned
off
with
a
girlish
giggle
,
and
on
an
occasional
failing
in
her
memory
,
that
had
no
rule
in
it
,
but
came
and
went
fantastically
,
as
if
in
mockery
of
her
fantastic
self
.
  
<EOS>
But
they
never
blushed
upon
a
change
in
the
new
manner
of
her
thought
and
speech
towards

And
though
that
daughter
often
came
within
their

they
never
blushed
upon
her
loveliness
irradiated

of
filial

its
stern

THE
forlorn
Miss
Tox
,
abandoned
by
her
friend
Louisa
Chick
,
and
bereft
of
Mr
Dombey
's
countenance
---
for
on
delicate
pair
of
wedding
cards
,
united
by
a
silver
thread
,
graced
the
chimney
-
glass
in
Princess
's
Place
,
or
the
harpsichord
,
or
any
of
those
little
posts
of
display
which
Lucretia
reserved
for
holiday
occupation
---
became
depressed
in
her
spirits
,
and
suffered
much
from
melancholy
.
<EOS>
For
a
time
the
Bird
Waltz
was
unheard
in
Princess
's
Place
,
the
plants
were
neglected
,
and
dust
collected
on
the
miniature
of
Miss
Tox
's
ancestor
with
the
powdered
head
and
pigtail
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
,
however
,
was
not
of
an
age
or
of
a
disposition
long
to
abandon
herself
to
unavailing
regrets
.
<EOS>
Only
two
notes
of
the
harpsichord
were
dumb
from
disuse
when
the
Bird
Waltz
again
warbled
and
trilled
in
the
crooked
drawing
-
room
:
only
one
slip
of
geranium
fell
a
victim
to
imperfect
nursing
,
before
she
was
gardening
at
her
green
baskets
again
,
regularly
every
morning
;
the
powdered
-
headed
ancestor
had
not
been
under
a
cloud
for
more
than
six
weeks
,
when
Miss
Tox
breathed
on
his
benignant
visage
,
and
polished
him
up
with
a
piece
of
wash
-
leather
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
Miss
Tox
was
lonely
,
and
at
a
loss
.
<EOS>
Her
attachments
,
however
ludicrously
shown
,
were
real
and
strong
;
and
she
was
,
as
she
expressed
it
,
"
deeply
hurt
by
the
unmerited
contumely
she
had
met
with
from
Louisa
.
"
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
such
thing
as
anger
in
Miss
Tox
's
composition
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
ambled
on
through
life
,
in
her
soft
-
spoken
way
,
without
any
opinions
,
she
had
,
at
least
,
got
so
far
without
any
harsh
passions
.
<EOS>
The
mere
sight
of
Louisa
Chick
in
the
street
one
day
,
at
a
considerable
distance
,
so
overpowered
her
milky
nature
,
that
she
was
fain
to
seek
immediate
refuge
in
a
pastrycook
's
,
and
there
,
in
a
musty
little
back
room
usually
devoted
to
the
consumption
of
soups
,
and
pervaded
by
an
ox
-
tail
atmosphere
,
relieve
her
feelings
by
weeping
plentifully
.
  
<EOS>
Against
Mr
Dombey
Miss
Tox
hardly
felt
that
she
had
any
reason
of
complaint
.
<EOS>
Her
sense
of
that
gentleman
's
magnificence
was
such
,
that
once
removed
from
him
,
she
felt
as
if
her
distance
always
had
been
immeasurable
,
and
as
if
he
had
greatly
condescended
in
tolerating
her
at
all
.
<EOS>
No
wife
could
be
too
handsome
or
too
stately
for
him
,
according
to
Miss
Tox
's
sincere
opinion
.
<EOS>
It
was
perfectly
natural
that
in
looking
for
one
,
he
should
look
high
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
with
tears
laid
down
this
proposition
,
and
fully
admitted
it
,
twenty
times
a
day
.
<EOS>
She
never
recalled
the
lofty
manner
in
which
Mr
Dombey
had
made
her
subservient
to
his
convenience
and
caprices
,
and
had
graciously
permitted
her
to
be
one
of
the
nurses
of
his
little
son
.
<EOS>
She
only
thought
,
in
her
own
words
,
"
that
she
had
passed
a
great
many
happy
hours
in
that
house
,
which
she
must
ever
remember
with
gratification
,
and
that
she
could
never
cease
to
regard
Mr
Dombey
as
one
of
the
most
impressive
and
dignified
to
men
.
"
  
<EOS>
Cut
off
,
however
,
from
the
implacable
Louisa
,
and
being
shy
of
the
Major
(
whom
she
viewed
with
some
distrust
now
)
,
Miss
Tox
found
it
very
irksome
to
know
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
in
Mr
Dombey
's
establishment
.
<EOS>
And
as
she
really
had
got
into
the
habit
of
considering
Dombey
and
Son
as
the
pivot
on
which
the
world
in
general
turned
,
she
resolved
,
rather
than
be
ignorant
of
intelligence
which
so
strongly
interested
her
,
to
cultivate
her
old
acquaintance
,
Mrs
Richards
,
who
she
knew
,
since
her
last
memorable
appearance
before
Mr
Dombey
,
was
in
the
habit
of
sometimes
holding
communication
with
his
servants
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
Miss
Tox
,
in
seeking
out
the
Toodle
family
,
had
the
tender
motive
hidden
in
her
breast
of
having
somebody
to
whom
she
could
talk
about
Mr
Dombey
,
no
matter
how
humble
that
somebody
might
be
.
  
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
towards
the
Toodle
habitation
Miss
Tox
directed
her
steps
one
evening
,
what
time
Mr
Toodle
,
cindery
and
swart
,
was
refreshing
himself
with
tea
,
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toodle
had
only
three
stages
of
existence
.
<EOS>
He
was
either
taking
refreshment
in
the
bosom
just
mentioned
,
or
he
was
tearing
through
the
country
at
from
twenty
-
five
to
fifty
miles
an
hour
,
or
he
was
sleeping
after
his
fatigues
.
<EOS>
He
was
always
in
a
whirlwind
or
a
calm
,
and
a
peaceable
,
contented
,
easy
-
going
man
<EOS>
Mr
Toodle
was
in
either
state
,
who
seemed
to
have
made
over
all
his
own
inheritance
of
fuming
and
fretting
to
the
engines
with
which
he
was
connected
,
which
panted
,
and
gasped
,
and
chafed
,
and
wore
themselves
out
,
in
a
most
unsparing
manner
,
while
Mr
Toodle
led
a
mild
and
equable
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
Polly
,
my
gal
,
"
said
Mr
Toodle
,
with
a
young
Toodle
on
each
knee
,
and
two
more
making
tea
for
him
,
and
plenty
more
scattered
about
---
<EOS>
Mr
Toodle
was
never
out
of
children
,
but
always
kept
a
good
supply
on
hand
---
"
you
an't
seen
our
Biler
lately
,
have
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Polly
,
"
but
he
's
almost
certain
to
look
in
tonight
.
<EOS>
It
's
his
right
evening
,
and
he
's
very
regular
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
said
Mr
Toodle
,
relishing
his
meal
infinitely
,
"
as
our
Biler
is
a
doin'
now
about
as
well
as
a
boy
can
do
,
eh
,
Polly
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
he
's
a
doing
beautiful
!
"
<EOS>
responded
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
an't
got
to
be
at
all
secret
-
like
---
<EOS>
has
he
,
Polly
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Mr
Toodle
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Mrs
Toodle
,
plumply
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
he
an't
got
to
be
at
all
secret
-
like
,
Polly
,
"
observed
Mr
Toodle
in
his
slow
and
measured
way
,
and
shovelling
in
his
bread
and
butter
with
a
clasp
knife
,
as
if
he
were
stoking
himself
,
"
because
that
do
n't
look
well
;
do
it
,
Polly
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
of
course
it
do
n't
,
father
.
<EOS>
How
can
you
ask
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
boys
and
gals
,
"
said
Mr
Toodle
,
looking
round
upon
his
family
,
"
wotever
you
're
up
to
in
a
honest
way
<EOS>
,
it
's
my
opinion
as
you
ca
n't
do
better
than
be
open
.
<EOS>
If
you
find
yourselves
in
cuttings
or
in
tunnels
,
do
n't
you
play
no
secret
games
.
<EOS>
Keep
your
whistles
going
,
and
let
's
know
where
you
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
rising
Toodles
set
up
a
shrill
murmur
,
expressive
of
their
resolution
to
profit
by
the
paternal
advice
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
makes
you
say
this
along
of
Rob
,
father
?
"
asked
his
wife
,
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Polly
,
old
'
ooman
,
"
said
Mr
Toodle
,
"
I
do
n't
know
as
I
said
it
partickler
along
o
'
Rob
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
I
starts
light
with
Rob
only
;
I
comes
to
a
branch
;
I
takes
on
what
I
finds
there
;
and
a
whole
train
of
ideas
gets
coupled
on
to
him
,
afore
<EOS>
I
knows
where
I
am
,
or
where
they
comes
from
.
<EOS>
What
a
Junction
a
man
's
thoughts
is
,
"
said
Mr
Toodle
,
"
to
-
be
-
sure
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
profound
reflection
Mr
Toodle
washed
down
with
a
pint
mug
of
tea
,
and
proceeded
to
solidify
with
a
great
weight
of
bread
and
butter
;
charging
his
young
daughters
meanwhile
,
to
keep
plenty
of
hot
water
in
the
pot
,
as
he
was
uncommon
dry
,
and
should
take
the
indefinite
quantity
of
"
a
sight
of
mugs
,
"
before
his
thirst
was
appeased
.
  
<EOS>
In
satisfying
himself
,
however
,
Mr
Toodle
was
not
regardless
of
the
younger
branches
about
him
,
who
,
although
they
had
made
their
own
evening
repast
,
were
on
the
look
-
out
for
irregular
morsels
,
as
possessing
a
relish
.
<EOS>
These
he
distributed
now
and
then
to
the
expectant
circle
,
by
holding
out
great
wedges
of
bread
and
butter
,
to
be
bitten
at
by
the
family
in
lawful
succession
,
and
by
serving
out
small
doses
of
tea
in
like
manner
with
a
spoon
;
which
snacks
had
such
a
relish
in
the
mouths
of
these
young
Toodles
,
that
,
after
partaking
of
the
same
,
they
performed
private
dances
of
ecstasy
among
themselves
,
and
stood
on
one
leg
apiece
,
and
hopped
,
and
indulged
in
other
saltatory
tokens
of
gladness
.
<EOS>
These
vents
for
their
excitement
found
,
they
gradually
closed
about
Mr
Toodle
again
,
and
eyed
him
hard
as
he
got
through
more
bread
and
butter
and
tea
;
affecting
,
however
,
to
have
no
further
expectations
of
their
own
in
reference
to
those
viands
,
but
to
be
conversing
on
foreign
subjects
,
and
whispering
confidently
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toodle
,
in
the
midst
of
this
family
group
,
and
setting
an
awful
example
to
his
children
in
the
way
of
appetite
,
was
conveying
the
two
young
Toodles
on
his
knees
to
Birmingham
by
special
engine
,
and
was
contemplating
the
rest
over
a
barrier
of
bread
and
butter
,
when
Rob
the
Grinder
,
in
his
sou'wester
hat
and
mourning
slops
,
presented
himself
,
and
was
received
with
a
general
rush
of
brothers
and
sisters
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
mother
!
<EOS>
"
said
Rob
,
dutifully
kissing
her
;
"
how
are
you
,
mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
my
boy
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Polly
,
giving
him
a
hug
and
a
pat
on
the
back
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Secret
!
<EOS>
Bless
you
,
father
,
not
he
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
intended
for
Mr
Toodle
's
private
edification
,
but
<EOS>
Rob
the
Grinder
,
whose
withers
were
not
unwrung
,
caught
the
words
as
they
were
spoken
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
father
's
been
a
saying
something
more
again
me
,
has
he
?
"
cried
the
injured
innocent
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
a
hard
thing
it
is
that
when
a
cove
has
once
gone
a
little
wrong
,
a
cove
's
own
father
should
be
always
a
throwing
it
in
his
face
behind
his
back
!
<EOS>
It
's
enough
,
"
cried
Rob
,
resorting
to
his
coat
-
cuff
in
anguish
of
spirit
,
"
to
make
a
cove
go
and
do
something
out
of
spite
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
poor
boy
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Polly
<EOS>
,
"
father
did
n't
mean
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
father
did
n't
mean
anything
,
"
blubbered
the
injured
Grinder
,
"
why
did
he
go
and
say
anything
,
mother
?
<EOS>
Nobody
thinks
half
so
bad
of
me
as
my
own
father
does
.
<EOS>
What
a
unnatural
thing
!
<EOS>
I
wish
somebody'd
take
and
chop
my
head
off
.
<EOS>
Father
would
n't
mind
doing
it
,
I
believe
,
and
<EOS>
I
'd
much
rather
he
did
that
than
t'other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
these
desperate
words
all
the
young
Toodles
shrieked
;
a
pathetic
effect
,
which
the
Grinder
improved
by
ironically
adjuring
them
not
to
cry
for
him
,
for
they
ought
to
hate
him
,
they
ought
,
if
they
was
good
boys
and
girls
;
and
this
so
touched
the
youngest
Toodle
but
one
,
who
was
easily
moved
,
that
it
touched
him
not
only
in
his
spirit
but
in
his
wind
too
;
making
him
so
purple
that
Mr
Toodle
in
consternation
carried
him
out
to
the
water
-
butt
,
and
would
have
put
him
under
the
tap
,
but
for
his
being
recovered
by
the
sight
of
that
instrument
.
  
<EOS>
Matters
having
reached
this
point
,
Mr
Toodle
explained
,
and
the
virtuous
feelings
of
his
son
being
thereby
calmed
,
they
shook
hands
,
and
harmony
reigned
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
do
as
I
do
,
Biler
,
my
boy
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
his
father
,
returning
to
his
tea
with
new
strength
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank'ee

father

<EOS>
Master

I
had
tea
together

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how

said
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well

Money

<EOS>
He
'll
never

He
has
such

He
ai
n't
a

I
'll
say
that
for

<EOS>
But
that

<EOS>
"
Not

cried
his

;
while
Mr
Toodle
opened
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
in

place

"
returned
the
Grinder
,
with
a
wink
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
wonder

friends

know

but
never
you
mind

mother

just
now

I
'm
all
right

all

"
  
<EOS>
The
indisputable
proof
afforded
in
these
hints
,
and
in
the
Grinder
's
mysterious
manner
,
of
his
not
being
subject
to
that
failing
which
Mr
Toodle
had
,
by
implication
,
attributed
to
him
,
might
have
led
to
a
renewal
of
his
wrongs
,
and
of
the
sensation
in
the
family
,
but
for
the
opportune
arrival
of
another
visitor
,
who
,
to
Polly
's
great
surprise
,
appeared
at
the
door
,
smiling
patronage
and
friendship
on
all
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Mrs
Richards
?
"
said
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
see
you

<EOS>
May
I
come
in

"
   
<EOS>
The
cheery
face
of
Mrs
Richards
shone
with
a
hospitable
reply
,
and
Miss
Tox
,
accepting
the
proffered
chair
,
and
gracefully
recognising
Mr
Toodle
on
her
way
to
it
,
united
her
bonnet
strings
,
and
said
that
in
the
first
place
she
must
beg
the
dear
children
,
one
and
all
,
to
come
and
kiss
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
ill
-
starred
youngest
Toodle
but
one
,
who
would
appear
,
from
the
frequency
of
his
domestic
troubles
,
to
have
been
born
under
an
unlucky
planet
,
was
prevented
from
performing
his
part
in
this
general
salutation
by
having
fixed
the
sou'wester
hat
(
with
which
he
had
been
previously
trifling
)
deep
on
his
head
,
hind
side
before
,
and
being
unable
to
get
it
off
again
;
which
accident
presenting
to
his
terrified
imagination
a
dismal
picture
of
his
passing
the
rest
of
his
days
in
darkness
,
and
in
hopeless
seclusion
from
his
friends
and
family
,
caused
him
to
struggle
with
great
violence
,
and
to
utter
suffocating
cries
.
<EOS>
Being
released
,
his
face
was
discovered
to
be
very
hot
,
and
red
,
and
damp
;
and
Miss
Tox
took
him
on
her
lap
,
much
exhausted
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
almost
forgotten
me
,
Sir
,
I
dare
say
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
to
Mr
Toodle
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Ma'am
,
no
,
"
said
Toodle
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
've
all
on
us
got
a
little
older
since
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
how
do
you
find
yourself
,
Sir

"
inquired
Miss
Tox
,
blandly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hearty
,
Ma'am

thank'ee

"
replied
Toodle
.
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
find
yourself
,
Ma'am

<EOS>
Do
the
rheumaticks
keep
off
pretty
well
,
Ma'am

<EOS>
We
must
all
expect
to
grow
into
'em
,
as
we
gets
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you

"
said
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
felt
any
inconvenience
from
that
disorder
yet

<EOS>

You

returned
Mr

<EOS>
"
Many

<EOS>
There
was
my
mother
---
"
But
catching
his
wife
's
eye
here
,
Mr
Toodle
judiciously
buried
the
rest
in
another
mug
of
tea
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
mean
to
say
,
Mrs
Richards

cried
Miss
Tox
,
looking
at
Rob

"
that
that
is
your

Eldest

said
Polly

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes

indeed

it
is

<EOS>
That
's
the
little
fellow

ma'am

that
was
the
innocent
cause
of
so
much

<EOS>
"
This

Ma'am

said
Toodle
,
"
is
him
with
the
short
legs

they
was

"
said
Mr
Toodle
,
with
a
touch
of
poetry
in
his
tone
,
"
unusual
short
for
leathers
---
as
Mr
Dombey
made
a
Grinder
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
recollection
of
almost
overpowered
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
The
subject
of
it
had
a
peculiar
interest
for
her
directly
.
<EOS>
She
asked
him
to
shake
hands
,
and
congratulated
his
mother
on
his
frank
,
ingenuous
face
.
<EOS>
Rob
,
overhearing
her
,
called
up
a
look
,
to
justify
the
eulogium
,
but
it
was
hardly
the
right
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
Mrs
Richards
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
---
"
<EOS>
and
you

addressing
Toodle
---
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell

that
a
little
distance

interposed
itself
between

of
my

that
where
I
used
to
visit
a
good
deal

I
do
not
visit
now

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Polly
,
who
,
with
a
woman
's
tact
,
understood
that
at
once
,
expressed
as
much
in
a
little
look
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toodle
,
who
had
not
the
faintest
idea
of
what
Miss
Tox
was
talking
about
,
expressed
that
also
,
in
a
stare
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
"
how
our
little
coolness
has
arisen
is
of
no
moment
,
and
does
not
require
to
be
discussed
.
<EOS>
It
is
sufficient
for
me
to
say
,
that
I
have
the
greatest
possible
respect
for
,
and
interest
in
,
Mr
Dombey
;
"
Miss
Tox
's
voice
faltered
;
"
and
everything
that
relates
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toodle
,
enlightened
,
shook
his
head
,
and
said
he
had
heerd
it
said
,
and
,
for
his
own
part
,
he
did
think
,
as
Mr
Dombey
was
a
difficult
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't

so

Sir

Miss

Let
me
entreat
you
not
to
say
so

Sir

either
now

or
at
any
future

<EOS>
Such
observations
can
not

be
very
painful
to
me
;
and
to
a
gentleman
,
whose
mind
is
constituted
as
,
I
am
quite
sure
yours
is
,
can
afford
no
permanent
satisfaction

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toodle
,
who
had
not
entertained
the
least
doubt
of
offering
a
remark
that
would
received
with
acquiescence
,
was
greatly
confounded
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
that
I
wish
to
say
,
Mrs
Richards
,
"
resumed
Miss
Tox
,
---
"
and
I
address
myself
to
you
too

Sir

is
this
.
<EOS>
That
any
intelligence
of
the
proceedings
of
the
family
,
of
the
welfare
of
the
family
,
of
the
health
of
the
family
,
that
reaches
you

will
be
always
most
acceptable
to
me

<EOS>
That
I
shall
be
always
very
glad
to
chat
with
Mrs
Richards
about
the
family
,
and
about
old
times
.
<EOS>
And
as
Mrs
Richards
and
I
never
had
the
least
difference
(
though
I
could
wish
now
that
we
had
been
better
acquainted
,
but
I
have
no
one
but
myself
to
blame
for
that
)
<EOS>
,
I
hope
she
will
not
object
to
our
being
very
good
friends
now
,
and
to
my
coming
backwards
and
forwards
here
,
when
I
like
,
without
being
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
really
hope
,
Mrs
Richards
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
earnestly
,
"
that
you
will
take
this

as
I
mean
it
,
like
a
good

humoured
creature
,
as
you
always
were
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Polly
was
gratified
,
and
showed
it
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toodle
did
n't
know
whether
he
was
gratified
or
not
,
and
preserved
a
stolid
calmness
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Mrs
Richards
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
---
"
<EOS>
and
I
hope
you
see
too
<EOS>
,
Sir
---
there
are
many
little
ways
in
which
I
can
be
slightly
useful
to
you
,
if
you
will
make
no
stranger
of
me
;
and
in
which
I
shall
be
delighted
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
For
instance
,
I
can
teach
your
children
something
.
<EOS>
I
shall
bring
a
few
little
books
,
if
you
'll
allow
me
,
and
some
work
,
and
of
an
evening
now
and
<EOS>
then
,
they
'll
learn
---
<EOS>
dear
me
,
they
'll
learn
a
great
deal
,
I
trust
,
and
be
a
credit
to
their
teacher
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toodle
,
who
had
a
great
respect
for
learning
,
jerked
his
head
approvingly
at
his
wife
,
and
moistened
his
hands
with
dawning
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
not
being
a
stranger
,
I
shall
be
in
nobody
's
way
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
"
and
everything
will
go
on
just
as
if
I
were
not
here
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Richards
will
do
her
mending
,
or
her
ironing
,
or
her
nursing
,
whatever
it
is
,
without
minding
me
:
and
you
'll
smoke
your
pipe
,
too
,
if
you
're
so
disposed
,
Sir
,
wo
n't
you
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
Mum
,
"
said
Mr
Toodle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
'll
take
my
bit
of
backer
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
good
of
you
to
say
so
,
Sir
,
"
rejoined
Miss
Tox
,
"
and
I
really
do
assure
you
now
,
unfeignedly
,
that
it
will
be
a
great
comfort
to
me
,
and
that
whatever
good
I
may
be
fortunate
enough
to
do
the
children
,
you
will
more
than
pay
back
to
me
,
if
you
'll
enter
into
this
little
bargain
comfortably
,
and
easily
,
and
good
-
naturedly
,
without
another
word
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
bargain
was
ratified
on
the
spot
;
and
Miss
Tox
found
herself
so
much
at
home
already
,
that
without
delay
she
instituted
a
preliminary
examination
of
the
children
all
roundwhich
Mr
Toodle
much
admired
---
and
booked
their
ages
,
names
,
and
acquirements
,
on
a
piece
of
paper
.
<EOS>
This
ceremony
,
and
a
little
attendant
gossip
prolonged
the
time
until
after
their
usual
hour
of
going
to
bed
,
and
detained
Mrs
Tox
at
the
Toodle
fireside
until
it
was
too
late
for
her
to
walk
home
alone
.
<EOS>
The
gallant
Grinder
,
however
,
being
still
there
,
politely
offered
to
attend
her
to
her
own
door
;
and
as
it
was
something
to
Miss
Tox
to
be
seen
home
by
a
youth
whom
Mr
Dombey
had
first
inducted
into
those
manly
garments
which
are
rarely
mentioned
by
name
,
she
very
readily
accepted
the
proposal
.
  
<EOS>
After
shaking
hands
with
Mr
Toodle
and
Polly
,
and
kissing
all
the
children
,
Miss
Tox
left
the
house
,
therefore
,
with
unlimited
popularity
,
and
carrying
away
with
her
so
light
a
heart
that
it
might
have
given
Mrs
Chick
offence
if
that
good
lady
could
have
weighed
it
.
  
<EOS>
Rob
the
Grinder
,
in
his
modesty
,
would
have
walked
behind
,
but
Miss
Tox
desired
him
to
keep
beside
her
,
for
conversational
purposes
;
and
,
as
she
afterwards
expressed
it
to
his
mother
,
"
drew
him
out
"
upon
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
He
drew
out
so
bright
,
and
clear
,
and
shining
,
that
Miss
Tox
was
charmed
with
him
.
<EOS>
The
more
Miss
Tox
drew
him
out
,
the
finer
he
came
---
like
wire
.
<EOS>
There
never
was
better
or
more
<EOS>
promising
youth
---
a
more
affectionate
,
steady
,
prudent
,
sober
,
honest
,
meek
,
candid
young
man
---
<EOS>
than
Rob
drew
out
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
glad
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
arrived
at
her
own
door
,
"
to
know
you

<EOS>
I
hope
you
'll
consider
me
your

that
you
'll
come

see
me
as
often

you

Do

<EOS>
"
Yes

returned
Rob

"
  
"
Very
laudable
indeed

"
said
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
to
hear
it

<EOS>
Put
this
half

crown
into
it

if
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
thank
you

Ma'am

replied
Rob
,
"
but
really
I
could
n't
think
of
depriving
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
commend
your
independent
spirit

"
said
Miss
Tox
,
"
but
<EOS>
it
's
no
deprivation
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
offended
if
you
do
n't
take
it
,
as
a
mark
of
my
good
-
will

<EOS>
Good
night

Good

<EOS>
Who
ran
sniggering
off
to
get
change
,
and
tossed
it
way
with
a
pieman

<EOS>
But
they
never
taught
honour
at
the
Grinders'School
,
where
the
system
that
prevailed
was
particularly
strong
in
the
engendering
of
hypocrisy
.
<EOS>
Insomuch
,
that
many
of
the
friends
and
masters
of
past
Grinders
said
,
if
this
were
what
came
of
education
for
the
common
people
,
let
have
none
.
  
<EOS>
Some
more
rational
said
,
let
us
have
a
better
one
.
<EOS>
But
the
governing
powers
of
the
Grinders
'
Company
were
always
ready
for
them
,
by
picking
out
a
few
boys
who
had
turned
out
well
,
in
spite
of
the
system
,
and
roundly
asserting
that
they
could
have
only
turned
out
well
because
of
it
.
<EOS>
Which
settled
the
business
of
those
objectors
out

established
the
glory
of
the

Edward
Cuttle
,
Mariner
 
TIME
,
sure
of
foot
and
strong
of
will
,
had
so
pressed
onward
,
that
the
year
enjoined
by
the
old
Instrument
-
maker
,
as
the
term
during
which
his
friend
should
refrain
from
opening
the
sealed
packet
accompanying
the
letter
he
had
left
for
him
,
was
now
nearly
expired
,
and
Captain
Cuttle
began
to
look
at
it
,
of
an
evening
,
with
feelings
of
mystery
and
uneasiness
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
in
his
honour
,
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
opening
the
parcel
one
hour
before
the
expiration
of
the
term
,
as
he
would
have
thought
of
opening
himself
,
to
study
his
own
anatomy
.
<EOS>
He
merely
brought
it
out
,
at
a
certain
stage
of
his
first
evening
pipe
,
laid
it
on
the
table
,
and
sat
gazing
at
the
outside
of
it
,
through
the
smoke
,
in
silent
gravity
,
for
two
or
three
hours
at
a
spell
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
when
he
had
contemplated
it
thus
for
a
pretty
long
while
,
the
Captain
would
hitch
his
chair
,
by
degrees
,
farther
and
farther
off
,
as
if
to
get
beyond
the
range
of
its
fascination
;
but
if
this
were
his
design
,
he
never
succeeded
:
for
even
when
he
was
brought
up
by
the
parlour
wall
,
the
packet
still
attracted
him
;
or
if
his
eyes
,
in
thoughtful
wandering
,
roved
to
the
ceiling
or
the
fire
,
its
image
immediately
followed
,
and
posted
itself
conspicuously
among
the
coals
,
or
took
up
an
advantageous
position
on
the
whitewash
.
  
<EOS>
In
respect
of
Heart
's
Delight
,
the
Captain
's
parental
regard
and
admiration
knew
no
change
.
<EOS>
But
since
his
last
interview
with
Mr
Carker
,
Captain
Cuttle
had
come
to
entertain
doubts
whether
his
former
intervention
in
behalf
of
that
young
lady
and
his
dear
boy
Wal'r
,
had
proved
altogether
so
favourable
as
he
could
have
wished
,
and
as
he
at
the
time
believed
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
was
troubled
with
a
serious
misgiving
that
he
had
done
more
harm
than
good
,
in
short
;
and
in
his
remorse
and
modesty
he
made
the
best
atonement
he
could
think
of
,
by
putting
himself
out
of
the
way
doing
any
harm
to
any
one
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
throwing
himself
overboard
for
a
dangerous
person
.
  
<EOS>
Self
-
buried
,
therefore
,
among
the
instruments
,
the
Captain
never
went
near
Mr
Dombey
's
house
,
or
reported
himself
in
any
way
to
Florence
or
Miss
Nipper
.
<EOS>
He
even
severed
himself
from
Mr
Perch
,
on
the
occasion
of
his
next
visit
,
by
dryly
informing
that
gentleman
,
that
the
thanked
him
for
his
company
,
but
had
cut
himself
adrift
from
all
such
acquaintance
,
as
he
did
n't
know
what
magazine
he
might
n't
blow
up
,
without
meaning
of
it
.
<EOS>
In
this
self
-
imposed
retirement
,
the
Captain
passed
whole
days
and
weeks
without
interchanging
a
word
with
any
one
<EOS>
but
Rob
the
Grinder
,
whom
he
esteemed
as
a
pattern
of
disinterested
attachment
and
fidelity
.
<EOS>
In
this
retirement
,
the
Captain
,
gazing
at
the
packet
of
an
evening
,
would
sit
smoking
,
and
thinking
of
Florence
and
poor
Walter
,
until
they
both
seemed
to
his
homely
fancy
to
be
dead
,
and
to
have
passed
away
into
eternal
youth
,
the
beautiful
and
innocent
children
of
his
first
remembrance
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
did
not
,
however
,
in
his
musings
,
neglect
his
own
improvement
,
or
the
mental
culture
of
Rob
the
Grinder
.
<EOS>
That
young
man
was
generally
required
to
read
out
of
some
book
to
the
Captain
,
for
one
hour
,
every
evening
;
and
as
the
Captain
implicitly
believed
that
all
books
were
true
,
he
accumulated
,
by
this
means
,
many
remarkable
facts
.
<EOS>
On
Sunday
nights
,
the
Captain
always
read
for
himself
,
before
going
to
bed
,
a
certain
Divine
Sermon
once
delivered
on
a
Mount
;
and
although
he
was
accustomed
to
quote
the
text
,
without
book
,
after
his
own
manner
,
he
appeared
to
read
it
with
as
reverent
an
understanding
of
its
heavenly
spirit
,
as
if
he
had
got
it
all
by
heart
in
Greek
,
and
had
been
able
to
write
any
number
of
fierce
theological
disquisitions
on
its
every
phrase
.
  
<EOS>
Rob
the
Grinder
,
whose
reverence
for
the
inspired
writings
,
under
the
admirable
system
of
the
Grinders
'
School
,
had
been
developed
by
a
perpetual
bruising
of
his
intellectual
shins
against
all
the
proper
names
of
all
the
tribes
of
Judah
,
and
by
the
monotonous
repetition
of
hard
verses
,
especially
by
way
of
punishment
,
and
by
the
parading
of
him
at
six
years
old
in
leather
breeches
,
three
times
a
Sunday
,
very
high
up
,
in
a
very
hot
church
,
with
a
great
organ
buzzing
against
his
drowsy
head
,
like
an
exceedingly
busy
bee
---
Rob
the
Grinder
made
a
mighty
show
of
being
edified
when
the
Captain
ceased
to
read
,
and
generally
yawned
and
nodded
while
the
reading
was
in
progress
.
<EOS>
The
latter
fact
being
never
so
much
as
suspected
by
the
good
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
also
,
as
a
man
of
business
,
took
to
keeping
books
.
<EOS>
In
these
he
entered
observations
on
the
weather
,
and
on
the
currents
of
the
waggons
and
other
vehicles
:
which
he
observed
,
in
that
quarter
,
to
set
westward
in
the
morning
and
during
the
greater
part
of
the
day
,
and
eastward
towards
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
stragglers
appearing
in
one
week
,
who
"
spoke
him
"
---
so
the
captain
entered
it
---
on
the
subject
of
spectacles
,
and
who
,
without
positively
purchasing
,
said
they
would
look
in
again
,
the
Captain
decided
that
the
business
was
improving
,
and
made
an
entry
in
the
day
-
book
to
that
effect
:
the
wind
then
blowing
(
which
he
first
recorded
)
pretty
fresh
,
west
and
by
north
;
having
changed
in
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
the
Captain
's
chief
difficulties
was
Mr
Toots
,
who
called
frequently
,
and
who
without
saying
much
seemed
to
have
an
idea
that
the
little
back
parlour
was
an
eligible
room
to
chuckle
in
,
as
he
would
sit
and
avail
himself
of
its
accommodations
in
that
regard
by
the
half
-
hour
together
,
without
at
all
advancing
in
intimacy
with
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
rendered
cautious
by
his
late
experience
,
was
unable
quite
to
satisfy
his
mind
<EOS>
whether
Mr
Toots
was
the
mild
subject
he
appeared
to
be
,
or
was
a
profoundly
artful
and
dissimulating
hypocrite
.
<EOS>
His
frequent
reference
to
Miss
Dombey
was
suspicious
;
but
the
Captain
had
a
secret
kindness
for
Mr
Toots
's
apparent
reliance
on
him
,
and
forbore
to
decide
against
him
for
the
present
;
merely
eyeing
him
,
with
a
sagacity
not
to
be
described
,
whenever
he
approached
the
subject
that
was
nearest
to
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Gills
,
"
blurted
out
Mr
Toots
,
one
day
all
at
once
,
as
his
manner
was
,
"
do
you
think
you
could
think
favourably
of
that
proposition
of
mine
,
and
give
me
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
tell
you
what
it
is
,
my
lad
,
"
replied
the
Captain
,
who
had
at
length
concluded
on
a
course
of
action
;
"
I
've
been
turning
that
there
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Captain
Gills
,
it
's
very
kind
of
you
,
"
retorted
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
much
obliged
to
you
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
and
honour
,
Captain
Gills
,
it
would
be
a
charity
to
give
me
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
It
really
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
brother
,
"
argued
the
Captain
slowly
,
"
I
do
n't
know
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
never
can
know
me
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
replied
Mr
Toots
,
steadfast
to
his
point
,
"
if
you
do
n't
give
me
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
seemed
struck
by
the
originality
and
power
of
this
remark
,
and
looked
at
Mr
Toots
as
if
he
thought
there
was
a
great
deal
more
in
him
than
he
had
expected
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
said
,
my
lad
,
"
observed
the
captain
,
nodding
his
head
thoughtfully
;
"
and
true
.
<EOS>
Now
look'ee
here
:
You
've
made
some
observations
to
me
,
which
gives
me
to
understand
as
you
admire
a
certain
sweet
creetur
.
<EOS>
Hey
?
"
  
"
Captain
Gills
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
gesticulating
violently
with
the
hand
in
which
he
held
his
hat
,
"
Admiration
is
not
the
word
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
honour
,
you
have
no
conception
what
my
feelings
are
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
be
dyed
black
,
and
made
Miss
Dombey
's
slave
,
I
should
consider
it
a
compliment
.
<EOS>
If
,
at
the
sacrifice
of
all
my
property
,
I
could
get
transmigrated
into
Miss
Dombey
's
dog
---
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
really
think
I
should
never
leave
off
wagging
my
tail
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
so
perfectly
happy
,
Captain
Gills
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
said
it
with
watery
eyes
,
and
pressed
his
hat
against
his
bosom
with
deep
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lad
,
"
returned
the
Captain
,
moved
to
compassion
,
"
if
you
're
in
arnest
---
"
  
"
Captain
Gills
,
"
cried
Mr
Toots
,
"
I
'm
in
such
a
state
of
mind
,
and
am
so
dreadfully
in
earnest
,
that
if
I
could
swear
to
it
upon
a
hot
piece
of
iron
,
or
a
live
coal
,
or
melted
lead
,
or
burning
sealing
-
wax
,
or
anything
of
that
sort
,
I
should
be
glad
to
hurt
myself
,
as
a
relief
to
my
feelings
.
"
<EOS>
And
Mr
Toots
looked
hurriedly
about
the
room
,
as
if
for
some
sufficiently
painful
means
of
accomplishing
his
dread
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
pushed
his
glazed
hat
back
upon
his
head
,
stroked
his
face
down
with
his
heavy
hand
---
making
his
nose
more
mottled
in
the
process
---
and
planting
himself
before
Mr
Toots
,
and
hooking
him
by
the
lapel
of
his
coat
,
addressed
him
in
these
words
,
while
Mr
Toots
looked
up
into
his
face
,
with
much
attention
and
some
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
're
in
arnest
,
you
see
,
my
lad
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
you
're
a
object
of
clemency
,
and
clemency
is
the
brightest
jewel
in
the
crown
of
a
Briton
's
head
,
for
which
you
'll
overhaul
the
constitution
as
laid
down
in
Rule
Britannia
,
and
,
when
found
,
that
is
the
charter
as
them
garden
angels
was
a
singing
of
,
<EOS>
so
many
times
over
.
<EOS>
Stand
by
!
<EOS>
This
here
proposal
<EOS>
o
'
you'rn
takes
me
a
little
aback
.
<EOS>
And
why
?
<EOS>
Because
I
holds
my
own
only
,
you
understand
,
in
these
here
waters
,
and
have
n't
got
no
consort
,
and
may
be
do
n't
wish
for
none
.
<EOS>
Steady
!
<EOS>
You
hailed
me
first
,
along
of
a
certain
young
lady
,
as
you
was
chartered
by
.
<EOS>
Now
if
you
and
me
is
to
keep
one
another
's
company
at
all
,
that
there
young
creetur
's
name
must
never
be
named
nor
referred
to
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
harm
may
n't
have
been
done
by
naming
of
it
too
free
,
afore
now
,
and
thereby
I
brings
up
short
.
<EOS>
D'ye
make
me
out
pretty
clear
,
brother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
'll
excuse
me
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
replied
Mr
Toots
,
"
if
I
do
n't
quite
follow
you
sometimes
.
<EOS>
But
upon
my
word
I
---
it
's
a
hard
thing
,
Captain
Gills
,
not
to
be
able
to
mention
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
I
really
have
got
such
a
dreadful
load
here
!
"
<EOS>
---
Mr
Toots
pathetically
touched
his
shirt
-
front
with
both
hands
---
"
that
I
feel
night
and
day
,
exactly
as
if
somebody
was
sitting
upon
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Them
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
is
the
terms
I
offer
.
<EOS>
If
they
're
hard
upon
you
,
brother
,
as
mayhap
they
are
,
give
'em
a
wide
berth
,
sheer
off
,
and
part
company
cheerily
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Gills
,
"
returned
Mr
Toots
,
"
I
hardly
know
how
it
is
,
but
after
what
you
told
me
when
I
came
here
,
for
the
first
time
,
I
---
I
feel
that
I
'd
rather
think
about
Miss
Dombey
in
your
society
than
talk
about
her
in
almost
anybody
else
's
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
Captain
Gills
,
if
you
'll
give
me
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
,
I
shall
be
very
happy
to
accept
it
on
your
own
conditions
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
be
honourable
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
holding
back
his
extended
hand
for
a
moment
,
"
and
therefore
I
am
obliged
to
say
that
I
can
not
help
thinking
about
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
It
's
impossible
for
me
to
make
a
promise
not
to
think
about
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lad
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
whose
opinion
of
Mr
Toots
was
much
improved
by
this
candid
avowal
,
"
a
man
's
thoughts
is
like
the
winds
,
and
<EOS>
nobody
ca
n't
answer
for
'em
for
certain
,
any
length
of
time
together
.
<EOS>
Is
it
a
treaty
as
to
words
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
words
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
returned
Mr
Toots
,
"
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
bind
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
gave
Captain
Cuttle
his
hand
upon
it
,
then
and
there
;
and
the
Captain
with
a
pleasant
and
gracious
show
of
condescension
,
bestowed
his
acquaintance
upon
him
formally
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
seemed
much
relieved
and
gladdened
by
the
acquisition
,
and
chuckled
rapturously
during
the
remainder
of
his
visit
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
for
his
part
,
was
not
ill
pleased
to
occupy
that
position
of
patronage
,
and
was
exceedingly
well
satisfied
by
his
own
prudence
and
foresight
.
  
<EOS>
But
rich
as
Captain
Cuttle
was
in
the
latter
quality
,
he
received
a
surprise
that
same
evening
from
a
no
less
ingenuous
and
simple
youth
,
than
Rob
the
Grinder
.
<EOS>
That
artless
lad
,
drinking
tea
at
the
same
table
,
and
bending
meekly
over
his
cup
and
saucer
,
having
taken
sidelong
observations
of
his
master
for
some
time
,
who
was
reading
the
newspaper
with
great
difficulty
,
but
much
dignity
,
through
his
glasses
,
broke
silence
by
saying
---
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Captain
,
but
you
may
n't
be
in
want
of
any
pigeons
,
may
you
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
lad
,
"
replied
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
was
wishing
to
dispose
of
mine
,
Captain
,
"
said
Rob
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
?
"
cried
the
Captain
,
lifting
up
his
bushy
eyebrows
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
'm
going
,
Captain
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
Rob
.
  
<EOS>
"
Going
?
<EOS>
Where
are
you
going
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
Captain
,
looking
round
at
him
over
the
glasses
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
?
<EOS>
did
n't
you
know
that
I
was
going
to
leave
you
,
Captain
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Rob
,
with
a
sneaking
smile
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
put
down
the
paper
,
took
off
his
spectacles
,
and
brought
his
eyes
to
bear
on
the
deserter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
Captain
,
I
am
going
to
give
you
warning
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
'd
have
known
that
beforehand
,
perhaps
,
"
said
Rob
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
and
getting
up
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
could
be
so
good
as
provide
yourself
soon
,
Captain
,
it
would
be
a
great
convenience
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
could
n't
provide
yourself
by
to
-
morrow
morning
,
I
am
afraid
,
Captain
:
<EOS>
could
you
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
're
a
going
to
desert
your
colours
,
are
you
,
my
lad
?
"
said
the
Captain
,
after
a
long
examination
of
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
very
hard
upon
a
cove
,
Captain
,
"
cried
the
tender
Rob
,
injured
and
indignant
in
a
moment
,
"
that
he
ca
n't
give
lawful
warning
,
without
being
frowned
at
in
that
way
,
and
called
a
deserter
.
<EOS>
You
have
n't
any
right
to
call
a
poor
cove
names
,
Captain
.
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
because
I
'm
a
servant
and
you
're
a
master
,
<EOS>
that
you
're
to
go
and
libel
me
.
<EOS>
What
wrong
have
I
done
?
<EOS>
Come
,
Captain
,
let
me
know
what
my
crime
is
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
stricken
Grinder
wept
,
and
put
his
coat
-
cuff
in
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Captain
,
"
cried
the
injured
youth
,
"
give
my
crime
a
name
!
<EOS>
What
have
I
been
and
done
?
<EOS>
Have
I
stolen
any
of
the
property
?
<EOS>
have
I
set
the
house
a
-
fire
?
<EOS>
If
I
have
,
why
do
n't
you
give
me
in
charge
,
and
try
it
?
<EOS>
But
to
take
away
the
character
of
a
lad
that
's
been
a
good
servant
to
you
,
because
he
ca
n't
afford
to
stand
in
his
own
light
for
your
good
,
what
a
injury
<EOS>
it
is
,
and
what
a
bad
return
for
faithful
service
!
<EOS>
This
is
the
way
young
coves
is
spiled
and
drove
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
at
you
,
Captain
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
All
of
which
the
Grinder
howled
forth
in
a
lachrymose
whine
,
and
backing
carefully
towards
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
've
got
another
berth
,
have
you
,
<EOS>
my
lad
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
Captain
,
eyeing
him
intently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Captain
,
since
you
put
it
in
that
shape
,
I
have
got
another
berth
,
"
cried
Rob
,
backing
more
and
more
;
"
a
better
berth
than
I
've
got
here
,
and
one
where
I
do
n't
so
much
as
want
your
good
word
,
Captain
,
which
is
fort'nate
for
me
,
after
all
the
dirt
you
've
<EOS>
throw'd
at
me
,
because
I
'm
poor
,
and
ca
n't
afford
to
stand
in
my
own
light
for
your
good
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
have
got
another
berth
;
and
if
it
was
n't
for
leaving
you
unprovided
,
Captain
,
I
'd
go
to
it
now
,
sooner
than
I
'd
take
them
names
from
you
,
because
I
'm
poor
,
and
ca
n't
afford
to
stand
in
my
own
light
for
your
good
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
reproach
me
for
being
poor
,
and
not
standing
in
my
own
light
for
your
good
,
Captain
?
<EOS>
How
can
you
so
demean
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
ye
here
,
my
boy
,
"
replied
the
peaceful
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
pay
out
no
more
of
them
words
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
do
n't
you
pay
in
no
more
of
your
words
,
Captain
,
"
retorted
the
roused
innocent
,
getting
louder
in
his
whine
,
and
backing
into
the
shop
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
sooner
you
took
my
blood
than
my
character
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
pursued
the
Captain
calmly
,
"
you
have
heerd
,
may
be
,
of
such
a
thing
as
a
rope
's
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
have
I
though
,
Captain
?
"
cried
the
taunting
Grinder
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
I
have
n't
.
<EOS>
I
never
heerd
of
any
such
a
article
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
it
's
my
belief
as
you
'll
know
more
about
it
pretty
soon
,
if
you
do
n't
keep
a
bright
look
-
out
.
<EOS>
I
can
read
your
signals
,
my
lad
.
<EOS>
You
may
go
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
may
go
at
once
,
may
I
,
Captain
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Rob
,
exulting
in
his
success
.
"
<EOS>
But
mind
!
<EOS>
I
never
asked
to
go
at
once
,
Captain
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
to
take
away
my
character
again
,
because
you
send
me
off
of
your
own
accord
.
<EOS>
And
you
're
not
to
stop
any
of
my
wages
,
Captain
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
employer
settled
the
last
point
by
producing
the
tin
canister
and
telling
the
Grinder
's
money
out
in
full
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
Rob
,
snivelling
and
sobbing
,
and
grievously
wounded
in
his
feelings
,
took
up
the
pieces
one
by
one
,
with
a
sob
and
a
snivel
for
each
,
and
tied
them
up
separately
in
knots
in
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
;
then
he
ascended
to
the
roof
of
the
house
and
filled
his
hat
and
pockets
with
pigeons
;
then
,
came
down
to
his
bed
under
the
counter
and
made
up
his
bundle
,
snivelling
and
sobbing
louder
as
if
he
were
cut
to
the
heart
by
old
associations
;
then
he
whined
,
"
Good
night
,
Captain
.
<EOS>
I
leave
you
without
malice
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
going
out
upon
the
door
-
step
,
pulled
the
little
Midshipman
's
nose
as
a
parting
indignity
,
and
went
away
down
the
street
grinning
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
left
to
himself
,
resumed
his
perusal
of
the
news
as
if
nothing
unusual
or
unexpected
had
taken
place
,
and
went
reading
on
with
the
greatest
assiduity
.
<EOS>
But
never
a
word
did
Captain
Cuttle
understand
,
though
he
read
a
vast
number
,
for
Rob
the
Grinder
was
scampering
up
one
column
and
down
another
all
through
the
newspaper
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
doubtful
whether
the
worthy
Captain
had
ever
felt
himself
quite
abandoned
until
now
;
but
now
,
old
Sol
Gills
,
Walter
,
and
Heart
's
Delight
were
lost
to
him
indeed
,
and
now
Mr
Carker
deceived
and
jeered
him
cruelly
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
represented
in
the
false
Rob
,
to
whom
he
had
held
forth
many
a
time
on
the
recollections
that
were
warm
within
him
;
he
had
believed
in
the
false
Rob
,
and
had
been
glad
to
believe
in
him
;
he
had
made
a
companion
of
him
as
the
last
of
the
old
ship
's
company
;
he
had
taken
the
command
of
the
little
Midshipman
with
him
at
his
right
hand
;
he
had
meant
to
do
his
duty
by
him
,
and
had
felt
almost
as
kindly
towards
the
boy
as
if
they
had
been
shipwrecked
and
cast
upon
a
desert
place
together
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
that
the
false
Rob
had
brought
distrust
,
treachery
,
and
meanness
into
the
very
parlour
,
which
was
a
kind
of
sacred
place
,
Captain
Cuttle
felt
as
if
the
parlour
might
have
gone
down
next
,
and
not
surprised
him
much
by
its
sinking
,
or
given
him
any
very
great
concern
.
  
<EOS>
Therefore
Captain
Cuttle
read
the
newspaper
with
profound
attention
and
no
comprehension
,
and
therefore
Captain
Cuttle
said
nothing
whatever
about
Rob
to
himself
,
or
admitted
to
himself
that
he
was
thinking
about
him
,
or
would
recognise
in
the
most
distant
manner
that
Rob
had
anything
to
do
with
his
feeling
as
lonely
as
Robinson
Crusoe
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
same
composed
,
business
-
like
way
,
the
Captain
stepped
over
to
Leadenhall
Market
in
the
dusk
,
and
effected
an
arrangement
with
a
private
watchman
on
duty
there
,
to
come
and
put
up
and
take
down
the
shutters
of
the
Wooden
Midshipman
every
night
and
morning
.
<EOS>
He
then
called
in
at
the
eating
-
house
to
diminish
by
one
half
the
daily
rations
theretofore
supplied
to
the
Midshipman
,
and
at
the
publichouse
to
stop
the
traitor
's
beer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
young
man
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
in
explanation
to
the
young
lady
at
the
bar
,
"
my
young
man
having
bettered
himself
,
<EOS>
Miss.
"
<EOS>
Lastly
,
the
Captain
resolved
to
take
possession
of
the
bed
under
the
counter
,
and
to
turn
in
there
o
'
nights
instead
of
up
stairs
,
as
sole
guardian
of
the
property
.
  
<EOS>
From
this
,
bed
Captain
Cuttle
daily
rose
thenceforth
,
and
clapped
on
his
glazed
hat
at
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
with
the
solitary
air
of
Crusoe
finishing
his
toilet
with
his
goat
-
skin
cap
;
and
although
his
fears
of
a
visitation
from
the
savage
tribe
,
MacStinger
,
were
somewhat
cooled
,
as
similar
apprehensions
on
the
part
of
that
lone
mariner
used
to
be
by
the
lapse
of
a
long
interval
without
any
symptoms
of
the
cannibals
,
he
still
observed
a
regular
routine
of
defensive
operations
,
and
never
encountered
a
bonnet
without
previous
survey
from
his
castle
of
retreat
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
(
during
which
he
received
no
call
from
Mr
Toots
,
who
wrote
to
say
he
was
out
of
town
)
<EOS>
his
own
voice
began
to
have
a
strange
sound
in
his
ears
;
and
he
acquired
such
habits
of
profound
meditation
from
much
polishing
and
stowing
away
of
the
stock
,
and
from
much
sitting
behind
the
counter
reading
,
or
looking
out
of
window
,
that
the
red
rim
made
on
his
forehead
by
the
hard
glazed
hat
,
sometimes
ached
again
with
excess
of
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
The
year
being
now
expired
,
Captain
Cuttle
deemed
it
expedient
to
open
the
packet
;
but
as
he
had
always
designed
doing
this
in
the
presence
of
Rob
the
Grinder
,
who
had
brought
it
to
him
,
and
as
he
had
an
idea
that
it
would
be
regular
and
<EOS>
ship
-
shape
to
open
it
in
the
presence
of
somebody
,
he
was
sadly
put
to
it
for
want
of
a
witness
.
<EOS>
In
this
difficulty
,
he
hailed
one
day
with
unusual
delight
the
announcement
in
the
Shipping
Intelligence
of
the
arrival
of
the
Cautious
Clara
,
Captain
John
Bunsby
,
from
a
coasting
voyage
;
and
to
that
philosopher
immediately
dispatched
a
letter
by
post
,
enjoining
inviolable
secrecy
as
to
his
place
of
residence
,
and
requesting
to
be
favoured
with
an
early
visit
,
in
the
evening
season
.
  
<EOS>
Bunsby
,
who
was
one
of
those
sages
who
act
upon
conviction
,
took
some
days
to
get
the
conviction
thoroughly
into
his
mind
,
that
he
had
received
a
letter
to
this
effect
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
had
grappled
with
the
fact
,
and
mastered
it
,
he
promptly
sent
his
boy
with
the
message
,
"
He
's
a
coming
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
Who
being
instructed
to
deliver
those
words
and
disappear
,
fulfilled
his
mission
like
a
tarry
spirit
,
charged
with
a
mysterious
warning
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
well
pleased
to
receive
it
,
made
preparation
of
pipes
and
rum
and
water
,
and
awaited
his
visitor
in
the
back
parlour
.
<EOS>
At
the
hour
of
eight
,
a
deep
lowing
,
as
of
a
nautical
Bull
,
outside
the
shop
-
door
,
succeeded
by
the
knocking
of
a
stick
on
the
panel
,
announced
to
the
listening
ear
of
Captain
Cuttle
,
that
Bunsby
was
alongside
:
whom
he
instantly
admitted
,
shaggy
and
loose
,
and
with
his
stolid
mahogany
visage
,
as
usual
,
appearing
to
have
no
consciousness
of
anything
before
it
,
but
to
be
attentively
observing
something
that
was
taking
place
in
quite
another
part
of
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bunsby
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
grasping
him
by
the
hand
,
"
what
cheer
,
my
lad
,
what
cheer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shipmet
,
"
replied
the
voice
within
Bunsby
,
unaccompanied
by
any
sign
on
the
part
of
the
Commander
himself
,
"
hearty
,
hearty
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bunsby
!
"
said
the
Captain
,
rendering
irrepressible
homage
to
his
genius
,
"
here
you
are
!
<EOS>
a
man
as
can
give
an
opinion
as
is
brighter
than
di'monds
---
and
give
me
the
lad
with
the
tarry
trousers
as
shines
to
me
like
di'monds
bright
,
for
which
you
'll
overhaul
the
Stanfell
's
Budget
,
and
when
found
make
a
note
.
<EOS>
Here
you
are
,
a
man
as
gave
an
opinion
in
this
here
very
place
,
that
has
come
true
,
every
letter
on
it
,
"
which
the
Captain
sincerely
believed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
?
"
growled
Bunsby
.
  
<EOS>
"
Every
letter
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
why
?
"
growled
Bunsby
,
looking
at
his
friend
for
the
first
time
.
"
Which
way
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
why
not
?
<EOS>
Therefore
.
<EOS>
"
With
these
oracular
words
---
they
seemed
almost
to
make
the
Captain
giddy
;
they
launched
him
upon
such
a
sea
of
speculation
and
conjecture
---
the
sage
submitted
to
be
helped
off
with
his
pilotcoat
,
and
accompanied
his
friend
into
the
back
parlour
,
where
his
hand
presently
alighted
on
the
rum
-
bottle
,
from
which
he
brewed
a
stiff
glass
of
grog
;
and
presently
afterwards
on
a
pipe
,
which
he
filled
,
lighted
,
and
began
to
smoke
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
imitating
his
visitor
in
the
matter
of
these
particulars
,
though
the
rapt
and
imperturbable
manner
of
the
great
Commander
was
far
above
his
powers
,
sat
in
the
opposite
corner
of
the
fireside
,
observing
him
respectfully
,
and
as
if
he
waited
for
some
encouragement
or
expression
of
curiosity
on
Bunsby
's
part
which
should
lead
him
to
his
own
affairs
.
<EOS>
But
as
the
mahogany
philosopher
gave
no
evidence
of
being
sentient
of
anything
but
warmth
and
tobacco
,
except
once
,
when
taking
his
pipe
from
his
lips
to
make
room
for
his
glass
,
he
incidentally
remarked
with
exceeding
gruffness
,
that
his
name
was
Jack
Bunsby
---
a
declaration
that
presented
but
small
opening
for
conversation
---
the
Captain
bespeaking
his
attention
in
a
short
complimentary
exordium
,
narrated
the
whole
history
of
Uncle
Sol
's
departure
,
with
the
change
it
had
produced
in
his
own
life
and
fortunes
;
and
concluded
by
placing
the
packet
on
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
long
pause
,
Mr
Bunsby
nodded
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Open
?
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
Bunsby
nodded
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
accordingly
broke
the
seal
,
and
disclosed
to
view
two
folded
papers
,
of
which
he
severally
read
the
endorsements
,
thus
:
"
Last
Will
and
Testament
of
Solomon
Gills
.
"
<EOS>
"
Letter
for
Ned
Cuttle
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bunsby
,
with
his
eye
on
the
coast
of
Greenland
,
seemed
to
listen
for
the
contents
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
therefore
hemmed
to
clear
his
throat
,
and
read
the
letter
aloud
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
My
dear
Ned
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
When
I
left
home
for
the
West
Indies
"
"
  
Here
the
Captain
stopped
,
and
looked
hard
at
Bunsby
,
who
looked
fixedly
at
the
coast
of
Greenland
.
   
---
"
"
in
forlorn
search
of
intelligence
of
my
dear
boy
,
I
knew
that
if
you
were
acquainted
with
my
design
,
you
would
thwart
it
,
or
accompany
me
;
and
therefore
I
kept
it
secret
.
<EOS>
If
you
ever
read
this
letter
,
Ned
,
I
am
likely
to
be
dead
.
<EOS>
You
will
easily
forgive
an
old
friend
's
folly
then
,
and
will
feel
for
the
restlessness
and
uncertainty
in
which
he
wandered
away
on
such
a
wild
voyage
.
<EOS>
So
no
more
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
little
hope
that
my
poor
boy
will
ever
read
these
words
,
or
gladden
your
eyes
with
the
sight
of
his
frank
face
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
;
no
more
,
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
,
sorrowfully
meditating
;
"
no
more
.
<EOS>
There
he
lays
,
all
his
days
---
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Bunsby
,
who
had
a
musical
ear
,
suddenly
bellowed
,
"
In
the
Bays
of
Biscay
,
O
!
"
<EOS>
which
so
affected
the
good
Captain
,
as
an
appropriate
tribute
to
departed
worth
,
that
he
shook
him
by
the
hand
in
acknowledgment
,
and
was
fain
to
wipe
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
!
"
said
the
Captain
with
a
sigh
,
as
the
Lament
of
Bunsby
ceased
to
ring
and
vibrate
in
the
skylight
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Affliction
sore
,
long
time
he
bore
,
and
let
us
overhaul
the
wollume
,
and
there
find
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Physicians
,
"
observed
Bunsby
,
"
was
in
vain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
what
's
the
good
o
'
<EOS>
them
in
two
or
three
hundred
fathoms
o
'
water
!
"
<EOS>
Then
returning
to
the
letter
,
he
read
on
:
---
"
<EOS>
"
But
if
he
should
be
by
,
when
it
is
opened
;
"
"
the
Captain
involuntarily
looked
round
,
and
shook
his
head
;
"
"
or
should
know
of
it
at
any
other
time
;
"
"
the
Captain
shook
his
head
again
;
"
"
my
blessing
on
him
!
<EOS>
In
case
the
accompanying
paper
is
not
legally
written
,
it
matters
very
little
,
for
there
is
no
one
interested
but
you
and
he
,
and
my
plain
wish
is
,
that
if
he
is
living
he
should
have
what
little
there
may
be
,
and
if
(
as
I
fear
)
<EOS>
otherwise
,
that
you
should
have
it
,
Ned
.
<EOS>
You
will
respect
my
wish
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
for
it
,
and
for
all
your
friendliness
besides
,
to
SOLOMON
GILLS
.
<EOS>
"
Bunsby
!
"
said
the
Captain
,
appealing
to
him
solemnly
,
"
what
do
you
make
of
this
?
<EOS>
There
you
sit
,
a
man
as
has
had
his
head
broke
from
infancy
up'ards
,
and
has
got
a
new
opinion
into
it
at
every
seam
as
has
been
opened
.
<EOS>
Now
,
what
do
you
make
o
'
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
so
be
,
"
returned
Bunsby
,
with
unusual
promptitude
,
"
as
he
's
dead
,
my
opinion
is
he
wo
n't
come
back
no
more
.
<EOS>
If
so
be
as
he
's
alive
,
my
opinion
is
he
will
.
<EOS>
Do
I
say
he
will
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Why
not
?
<EOS>
Because
the
bearings
of
this
obserwation
lays
in
the
application
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bunsby
!
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
,
who
would
seem
to
have
estimated
the
value
of
his
distinguished
friend
's
opinions
in
proportion
to
the
immensity
of
the
difficulty
he
experienced
in
making
anything
out
of
them
;
"
Bunsby
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
quite
confounded
by
admiration
,
"
you
carry
a
weight
of
mind
easy
,
as
would
swamp
one
of
my
tonnage
soon
.
<EOS>
But
in
regard
o
'
this
here
will
,
I
do
n't
mean
to
take
no
steps
towards
the
property
---
Lord
forbid
!
---
<EOS>
except
to
keep
it
for
a
more
rightful
owner
;
and
I
hope
yet
as
the
rightful
owner
,
Sol
Gills
,
is
living
and
'll
come
back
,
strange
as
it
is
that
he
ai
n't
forwarded
no
dispatches
.
<EOS>
Now
,
what
is
your
opinion
,
Bunsby
,
as
to
stowing
of
these
here
papers
away
again
,
and
marking
outside
as
they
was
opened
,
such
a
day
,
in
the
presence
of
John
Bunsby
and
Ed'ard
Cuttle
?
"
  
<EOS>
Bunsby
,
descrying
no
objection
,
on
the
coast
of
Greenland
or
elsewhere
,
to
this
proposal
,
it
was
carried
into
execution
;
and
that
great
man
,
bringing
his
eye
into
the
present
for
a
moment
,
affixed
his
sign
-
manual
to
the
cover
,
totally
abstaining
,
with
characteristic
modesty
,
from
the
use
of
capital
letters
.
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
having
attached
his
own
left
-
handed
signature
,
and
locked
up
the
packet
in
the
iron
safe
,
entreated
his
guest
to
mix
another
glass
and
smoke
another
pipe
;
and
doing
the
like
himself
,
fell
a
musing
over
the
fire
on
the
possible
fortunes
of
the
poor
old
Instrument
-
maker
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
a
surprise
occurred
,
so
overwhelming
and
terrific
that
Captain
Cuttle
,
unsupported
by
the
presence
of
Bunsby
,
must
have
sunk
beneath
it
,
and
been
a
lost
man
from
that
fatal
hour
.
  
<EOS>
How
the
Captain
,
even
in
the
satisfaction
of
admitting
such
a
guest
,
could
have
only
shut
the
door
,
and
not
locked
it
,
of
which
negligence
he
was
undoubtedly
guilty
,
is
one
of
those
questions
that
must
for
ever
remain
mere
points
of
speculation
,
or
vague
charges
against
destiny
.
<EOS>
But
by
that
unlocked
door
,
at
this
quiet
moment
,
did
the
fell
MacStinger
dash
into
the
parlour
,
bringing
Alexander
MacStinger
in
her
parental
arms
,
and
confusion
and
vengeance
(
not
to
mention
Juliana
MacStinger
,
and
the
sweet
child
's
brother
,
Charles
MacStinger
,
popularly
known
about
the
scenes
of
his
youthful
sports
,
as
Chowley
)
in
her
train
.
<EOS>
She
came
so
swiftly
and
so
silently
,
like
a
rushing
air
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
East
India
Docks
,
that
Captain
Cuttle
found
himself
in
the
very
act
of
sitting
looking
at
her
,
before
the
calm
face
with
which
he
had
been
meditating
,
changed
to
one
of
horror
and
dismay
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
moment
Captain
Cuttle
understood
the
full
extent
of
his
misfortune
,
self
-
preservation
dictated
an
attempt
at
flight
.
<EOS>
Darting
at
little
door
which
opened
from
the
parlour
on
the
steep
little
range
of
cellar
-
steps
,
the
Captain
made
a
rush
,
head
-
foremost
,
at
the
latter
,
like
a
man
indifferent
to
bruises
and
contusions
,
who
only
sought
to
hide
himself
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
In
this
gallant
effort
he
would
probably
have
succeeded
,
but
for
the
affectionate
dispositions
of
Juliana
and
Chowley
,
who
pinning
him
by
the
legs
---
one
of
those
dear
children
holding
on
to
each
---
claimed
him
as
their
friend
,
with
lamentable
cries
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
Mrs
MacStinger
,
who
never
entered
upon
any
action
of
importance
without
previously
inverting
Alexander
MacStinger
,
to
bring
him
within
the
range
of
a
brisk
battery
of
slaps
,
and
then
sitting
him
down
to
cool
as
the
reader
first
beheld
him
,
performed
that
solemn
rite
,
as
if
on
this
occasion
it
were
a
sacrifice
to
the
Furies
;
and
having
deposited
the
victim
on
the
floor
,
made
at
the
Captain
with
a
strength
of
purpose
that
appeared
to
threaten
scratches
to
the
interposing
Bunsby
.
  
<EOS>
The
cries
of
the
two
elder
MacStingers
,
and
the
wailing
of
young
Alexander
,
who
may
be
said
to
have
passed
a
piebald
childhood
,
forasmuch
as
he
was
black
in
the
face
during
one
half
of
that
fairy
period
of
existence
,
combined
to
make
this
visitation
the
more
awful
.
<EOS>
But
when
silence
reigned
again
,
and
the
Captain
,
in
a
violent
perspiration
,
stood
meekly
looking
at
Mrs
MacStinger
,
its
terrors
were
at
their
height
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Cap'en
Cuttle
,
Cap'en
Cuttle
!
"
said
Mrs
MacStinger
,
making
her
chin
rigid
,
and
shaking
it
in
unison
with
what
,
but
for
the
weakness
of
her
sex
,
might
be
described
as
her
fist
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Cap'en
Cuttle
,
Cap'en
Cuttle
,
do
you
dare
to
look
me
in
the
face
,
and
not
be
struck
down
in
the
herth
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
who
looked
anything
but
daring
,
feebly
muttered
"
Stand
by
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
I
was
a
weak
of
trusting
Fool
when
I
took
you
under
my
roof
,
<EOS>
Cap'en
Cuttle
,
I
was
!
"
cried
Mrs
MacStinger
.
<EOS>
"
To
think
of
the
benefits
I
've
showered
on
that
man
,
and
the
way
in
which
I
brought
my
children
up
to
love
and
honour
him
as
if
he
was
a
father
to
'em
,
when
there
an't
a
'
ousekeeper
,
no
nor
a
lodger
in
our
street
,
do
n't
know
that
I
lost
money
by
that
man
,
and
by
his
guzzlings
and
his
muzzlings
"
---
<EOS>
Mrs
MacStinger
used
the
last
word
for
the
joint
sake
of
alliteration
and
aggravation
,
rather
than
for
the
expression
of
any
idea
---
"
and
when
they
cried
out
one
and
all
,
shame
upon
him
for
putting
upon
an
industrious
woman
,
up
early
and
late
for
the
good
of
her
young
family
,
and
keeping
her
poor
place
so
clean
that
a
individual
might
have
ate
his
dinner
,
yes
,
and
his
tea
too
,
if
he
was
so
disposed
,
off
any
one
of
the
floors
or
stairs
,
in
spite
of
all
his
guzzlings
and
his
muzzlings
,
<EOS>
such
was
the
care
and
pains
bestowed
upon
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
MacStinger
stopped
to
fetch
her
breath
;
and
her
face
flushed
with
triumph
in
this
second
happy
introduction
of
of
Captain
Cuttle
's
muzzlings
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
runs
awa
-
a

a

"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
MacStinger
,
with
a
lengthening
out
of
the
last
syllable
that
made
the
unfortunate
Captain
regard
himself
as
the
meanest
of
men
;
"
and
keeps
away
a
twelvemonth
!
<EOS>
From
a
woman
!
<EOS>
Sitch

n't
the
courage

"
long
syllable
again
;
"
but
steals
away
,
like
a
felion
.
<EOS>
Why
,
if
that
baby
of
mine
,
"
said
Mrs
MacStinger
,
with
sudden
rapidity
,
"
was
to
offer
to
go
and
steal
away
,
I
'd
do
my
duty
as
a
mother
by
him
,
till
he
was
covered
with
wales
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
young
Alexander
,
interpreting
this
into
a
positive
promise
,
to
be
shortly
redeemed
,
tumbled
over
with
fear
and
grief
,
and
lay
upon
the
floor
,
exhibiting
the
soles
of
his
shoes
and
making
such
a
deafening
outcry
,
that
Mrs
MacStinger
found
it
necessary
to
take
him
up
in
her
arms
,
where
she
quieted
him
,
ever
and
anon
,
as
he
broke
out
again
,
by
a
shake
that
seemed
enough
to
loosen
his
teeth
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
pretty
sort
of
man
is
Cap'en
Cuttle
,
"
said
Mrs
MacStinger
,
with
a
sharp
stress
on
the
first
syllable
of
the
Captain
's
name
,
"
to
take
on
for
---
and
to
lose
sleep
for

and
to
faint
along

and
to
think

forsooth

and
to
go
up

down
the

asking
questions
after

<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
Ha

<EOS>
Cap'en
Cuttle

"
said
Mrs
MacStinger
,
with
severe
reaction
in
her
voice
and
manner
,
"
I
wish
to
know
if
you
're
a

coming

"
  
<EOS>
The
frightened
Captain
looked
into
his
hat
,
as
if
he
saw
nothing
for
it
but
to
put
it
on
,
and
give
himself
up

<EOS>
"
Cap'en
Cuttle
,
"
repeated
Mrs
MacStinger
,
in
the
same
determined
manner
,
"
I
wish
to
know
if
you
're
a
-
coming
home
,
Sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
seemed
quite
ready
to
go
,
but
faintly
suggested
something
to
the
effect
of
"
not
making
so
much
noise
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
aye
,
"
said
Bunsby
,
in
a
soothing
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Awast
,
my
lass
,
awast
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
may
YOU
be
,
if
you
please
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Mrs
MacStinger
,
with
chaste
loftiness
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
lodge
at
Number
Nine
,
Brig
Place
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
My
memory
may
be
bad
,
but
not
with
me
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
Mrs
Jollson
lived
at
Number
Nine
before
me
,
and
perhaps
you
're
mistaking
me
for
her
.
<EOS>
That
is
my
only
ways
of
accounting
for
your
familiarity
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
come
,
my
lass
,
awast
,
awast
!
"
said
Bunsby
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
could
hardly
believe
it
,
even
of
this
great
man
,
though
he
saw
it
done
with
his
waking
eyes
;
but
Bunsby
,
advancing
boldly
,
put
his
shaggy
blue
arm
round
Mrs
MacStinger
,
and
so
softened
her
by
his
magic
way
of
doing
it
,
and
by
these
few
words
---
he
said
no
more
---
that
she
melted
into
tears
,
after
looking
upon
him
for
a
few
moments
,
and
observed
that
a
child
might
conquer
her
now
,
she
was
so
low
in
her
courage
.
  
<EOS>
Speechless
and
utterly
amazed
<EOS>
,
the
Captain
saw
him
gradually
persuade
this
inexorable
woman
into
the
shop
,
return
for
rum
and
water
and
a
candle
,
take
them
to
her
,
and
pacify
her
without
appearing
to
utter
one
word
.
<EOS>
Presently
he
looked
in
with
his
pilot
-
coat
on
,
and
said
,
"
Cuttle
,
I
'm
a
-
going
to
act
as
convoy
home
;
"
and
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
more
to
his
confusion
than
if
he
had
been
put
in
irons
himself
,
for
safe
transport
to
Brig
Place
,
saw
the
family
pacifically
filing
off
,
with
Mrs
MacStinger
at
their
head
.
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
time
to
take
down
his
canister
,
and
stealthily
convey
some
money
into
the
hands
of
Juliana
MacStinger
,
his
former
favourite
,
and
Chowley
,
who
had
the
claim
upon
him
that
he
was
naturally
of
a
maritime
build
,
before
the
Midshipman
was
abandoned
by
them
all
;
and
Bunsby
whispering
that
he
'd
carry
on
smart
,
and
hail
Ned
Cuttle
again
before
he
went
aboard
,
shut
the
door
upon
himself
,
as
the
last
member
of
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
Some
uneasy
ideas
that
he
must
be
walking
in
his
sleep
,
or
that
he
had
been
troubled
with
phantoms
,
and
not
a
family
of
flesh
and
blood
,
beset
the
Captain
at
first
,
when
he
went
back
to
the
little
parlour
,
and
found
himself
alone
.
<EOS>
Illimitable
faith
in
,
and
immeasurable
admiration
of
,
the
Commander
of
the
Cautious
Clara
,
succeeded
,
and
threw
the
Captain
into
a
wondering
trance
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
as
time
wore
on
,
and
Bunsby
failed
to
reappear
,
the
Captain
began
to
entertain
uncomfortable
doubts
of
another
kind
.
<EOS>
Whether
Bunsby
had
been
artfully
decoyed
to
Brig
Place
,
and
was
there
detained
in
safe
custody
as
hostage
for
his
friend
;
in
which
case
it
would
become
the
Captain
,
as
a
man
of
honour
,
to
release
him
,
by
the
sacrifice
of
his
own
liberty
.
<EOS>
Whether
he
had
been
attacked
and
defeated
by
Mrs
MacStinger
,
and
was
ashamed
to
show
himself
after
his
discomfiture
.
<EOS>
Whether
Mrs
MacStinger
,
thinking
better
of
it
,
in
the
uncertainty
of
her
temper
,
had
turned
back
to
board
the
Midshipman
again
,
and
Bunsby
,
pretending
to
conduct
her
by
a
short
cut
,
was
endeavouring
to
lose
the
family
amid
the
wilds
and
savage
places
of
the
City
.
<EOS>
Above
all
,
what
it
would
behove
him
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
to
do
,
in
case
of
his
hearing
no
more
,
either
of
the
MacStingers
or
of
Bunsby
,
which
,
in
these
wonderful
and
unforeseen
conjunctions
of
events
,
might
possibly
happen
.
  
<EOS>
He
debated
all
this
until
he
was
tired
;
and
still
no
Bunsby
.
<EOS>
He
made
up
his
bed
under
the
counter
,
all
ready
for
turning
in
;
and
still
no
Bunsby
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
when
the
Captain
had
given
him
up
,
for
that
night
at
least
,
and
had
begun
to
undress
,
the
sound
of
approaching
wheels
was
heard
,
and
,
stopping
at
the
door
,
was
succeeded
by
Bunsby
's
hail
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
trembled
to
think
that
Mrs
MacStinger
was
not
to
be
got
rid
of
,
and
had
been
brought
back
in
a
coach
.
  
<EOS>
But
no
.
<EOS>
Bunsby
was
accompanied
by
nothing
but
a
large
box
,
which
he
hauled
into
the
shop
with
his
own
hands
,
and
as
soon
as
he
had
hauled
in
,
sat
upon
.
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
knew
it
for
the
chest
he
had
left
at
Mrs
MacStinger
's
house
,
and
looking
,
candle
in
hand
,
at
Bunsby
more
attentively
,
believed
that
he
was
three
sheets
in
the
wind
,
or
,
it
plain
words
,
drunk
.
<EOS>
It
was
difficult
,
however
,
to
be
sure
of
this
;
the
Commander
having
no
trace
of
expression
in
his
face
when
sober
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cuttle
,
"
said
the
Commander
,
getting
off
the
chest
,
and
opening
the
lid
,
"
are
these
here
your
traps
?
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
looked
in
and
identified
his
property
.
  
<EOS>
"
Done
pretty
taut
and
trim
,
hey
,
shipmet
?
"
said
Bunsby
.
  
<EOS>
The
grateful
and
bewildered
Captain
grasped
him
by
the
hand
,
and
was
launching
into
a
reply
expressive
of
his
astonished
feelings
,
when
Bunsby
disengaged
himself
by
a
jerk
of
his
wrist
,
and
seemed
to
make
an
effort
to
wink
with
his
revolving
eye
,
the
only
effect
of
which
attempt
,
in
his
condition
,
was
nearly
to
overbalance
him
.
<EOS>
He
then
abruptly
opened
the
door
,
and
shot
away
to
rejoin
the
Cautious
Clara
with
all
speed
---
supposed
to
be
his
invariable
custom
,
whenever
he
considered
he
had
made
a
point
.
  
<EOS>
As
it
was
not
his
humour
to
be
often
sought
,
Captain
Cuttle
decided
not
to
go
or
send
to
him
next
day
,
or
until
he
should
make
his
gracious
pleasure
known
in
such
wise
,
or
failing
that
,
until
some
little
time
should
have
elapsed
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
therefore
,
renewed
his
solitary
life
next
morning
,
and
thought
profoundly
,
many
mornings
,
noons
,
and
nights
,
of
old
Sol
Gills
,
and
Bunsby
's
sentiments
concerning
him
,
and
the
hopes
there
were
of
his
return
.
<EOS>
Much
of
such
thinking
strengthened
Captain
Cuttle
's
hopes
;
and
he
humoured
them
and
himself
by
watching
for
the
Instrument
-
maker
at
the
door
as
he
ventured
to
do
now
,
in
his
strange
liberty
---
and
setting
his
chair
in
its
place
,
and
arranging
the
little
parlour
as
it
used
to
be
,
in
case
he
should
come
home
unexpectedly
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
,
in
his
thoughtfulness
,
took
down
a
certain
little
miniature
of
Walter
as
a
schoolboy
,
from
its
accustomed
nail
,
lest
it
should
shock
the
old
man
on
his
return
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
had
his
presentiments
,
too
,
sometimes
,
that
he
would
come
on
such
a
day
;
and
one
particular
Sunday
,
even
ordered
a
double
allowance
of
dinner
,
he
was
so
sanguine
.
<EOS>
But
come
,
old
Solomon
did
not
;
and
still
the
neighbours
noticed
how
the
seafaring
man
in
the
glazed
hat
,
stood
at
the
shop
-
door
of
an
evening
,
looking
up
and
down
the
street
.

Chapter

<EOS>
Domestic
Relations
 
<EOS>
IT
was
not
in
the
nature
of
things
that
a
man
of
Mr
Dombey
's
mood
,
opposed
to
such
a
spirit
as
he
had
raised
against
himself
,
should
be
softened
in
the
imperious
asperity
of
his
temper
;
or
that
the
cold
hard
armour
of
pride
in
which
he
lived
encased
,
should
be
made
more
flexible
by
constant
collision
with
haughty
scorn
and
defiance
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
curse
of
such
a
nature
---
it
is
a
main
part
of
the
heavy
retribution
on
itself
it
bears
within
itself
---
<EOS>
that
while
deference
and
concession
swell
its
evil
qualities
,
and
are
the
food
it
grows
upon
,
resistance
and
a
questioning
of
its
exacting
claims
,
foster
it
too
,
no
less
.
<EOS>
The
evil
that
is
in
it
finds
equally
its
means
of
growth
and
propagation
in
opposites
.
<EOS>
It
draws
support
and
life
from
sweets
and
bitters
;
bowed
down
before
,
or
unacknowledged
,
it
still
enslaves
the
breast
in
which
it
has
its
throne
;
and
,
worshipped
or
rejected
,
is
as
hard
a
master
as
the
Devil
in
dark
fables
.
  
<EOS>
Towards
his
first
wife
,
Mr
Dombey
,
in
his
cold
and
lofty
arrogance
,
had
borne
himself
like
the
removed
Being
he
almost
conceived
himself
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
"
Mr
Dombey
"
with
her
when
she
first
saw
him
,
and
he
was
"
Mr
Dombey
"
when
she
died
.
<EOS>
He
had
asserted
his
greatness
during
their
whole
married
life
,
and
she
had
meekly
recognised
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
kept
his
distant
seat
of
state
on
the
top
of
his
throne
,
and
she
her
humble
station
on
its
lowest
step
;
and
much
good
it
had
done
him
,
so
to
live
in
solitary
bondage
to
his
one
idea
!
<EOS>
He
had
imagined
that
the
proud
character
of
his
second
wife
would
have
been
added
to
his
own
---
would
have
merged
into
it
,
and
exalted
his
greatness
.
<EOS>
He
had
pictured
himself
haughtier
than
ever
,
with
Edith
's
haughtiness
subservient
to
his
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
entertained
the
possibility
of
its
arraying
itself
against
him
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
when
he
found
it
rising
in
his
path
at
every
step
and
turn
of
his
daily
life
,
fixing
its
cold
,
defiant
,
and
contemptuous
face
upon
him
,
this
pride
of
his
,
instead
of
withering
,
or
hanging
down
its
head
beneath
the
shock
,
put
forth
new
shoots
,
became
more
concentrated
and
intense
,
more
gloomy
,
sullen
,
irksome
,
and
unyielding
,
than
it
had
ever
been
before
.
  
<EOS>
Who
wears
such
armour
,
too
,
bears
with
him
ever
another
heavy
retribution
.
<EOS>
It
is
of
proof
against
conciliation
,
love
,
and
confidence
!
<EOS>
against
all
gentle
sympathy
from
without
,
all
trust
,
all
tenderness
,
all
soft
emotion
;
but
to
deep
stabs
in
the
selflove
,
it
is
as
vulnerable
as
the
bare
breast
to
steel
;
and
such
tormenting
festers
rankle
there
,
as
follow
on
no
other
wounds
,
no
,
though
dealt
with
the
mailed
hand
of
Pride
itself
,
on
weaker
pride
,
disarmed
and
thrown
down
.
  
<EOS>
Such
wounds
were
his
.
<EOS>
He
felt
them
sharply
,
in
the
solitude
of
his
old
rooms
;
whither
he
now
began
often
to
retire
again
,
and
pass
long
solitary
hours
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
his
fate
to
be
ever
proud
and
powerful
;
ever
humbled
and
powerless
where
he
would
be
most
strong
.
<EOS>
Who
seemed
fated
to
work
out
that
doom
?
  
<EOS>
Who
?
<EOS>
Who
was
it
who
could
win
his
wife
as
she
had
won
his
boy
?
<EOS>
Who
was
it
who
had
shown
him
that
new
victory
,
as
he
sat
in
the
dark
corner
?
<EOS>
Who
was
it
<EOS>
whose
least
word
did
what
his
utmost
means
could
not
?
<EOS>
Who
was
it
who
,
unaided
by
his
love
,
regard
or
notice
,
thrived
and
grew
beautiful
when
those
so
aided
died
?
<EOS>
Who
could
it
be
,
but
the
same
child
at
whom
he
had
often
glanced
uneasily
in
her
motherless
infancy
,
with
a
kind
of
dread
,
lest
he
might
come
to
hate
her
;
and
of
whom
his
foreboding
was
fulfilled
,
for
he
DID
hate
her
in
his
heart
?
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
he
would
have
it
hatred
,
and
he
made
it
hatred
,
though
some
sparkles
of
the
light
in
which
she
had
appeared
before
him
on
the
memorable
night
of
his
return
home
with
his
Bride
,
occasionally
hung
about
her
still
.
<EOS>
He
knew
now
that
she
was
beautiful
;
he
did
not
dispute
that
she
was
graceful
and
winning
,
and
that
in
the
bright
dawn
of
her
womanhood
she
had
come
upon
him
,
a
surprise
.
<EOS>
But
he
turned
even
this
against
her
.
<EOS>
In
his
sullen
and
unwholesome
brooding
,
the
unhappy
man
,
with
a
dull
perception
of
his
alienation
from
all
hearts
,
and
a
vague
yearning
for
what
he
had
all
his
life
repelled
,
made
a
distorted
picture
of
his
rights
and
wrongs
,
and
justified
himself
with
it
against
her
.
<EOS>
The
worthier
she
promised
to
be
of
him
<EOS>
,
the
greater
claim
he
was
disposed
to
ante
-
date
upon
her
duty
and
submission
?
<EOS>
When
had
she
ever
shown
him
duty
and
submission
?
<EOS>
Did
she
grace
his
life
---
or
Edith
's
?
<EOS>
Had
her
attractions
been
manifested
first
to
him
---
or
Edith
?
<EOS>
Why
,
he
and
she
had
never
been
,
from
her
birth
,
like
father
and
child
!
<EOS>
They
had
always
been
estranged
.
<EOS>
She
had
crossed
him
every
way
and
everywhere
.
<EOS>
She
was
leagued
against
him
now
.
<EOS>
Her
very
beauty
softened
natures
that
were
obdurate
to
him
,
and
insulted
him
with
an
unnatural
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
have
been
that
in
all
this
there
were
mutterings
of
an
awakened
feeling
in
his
breast
,
however
selfishly
aroused
by
his
position
of
disadvantage
,
in
comparison
with
what
she
might
have
made
his
life
.
<EOS>
But
he
silenced
the
distant
thunder
with
the
rolling
of
his
sea
of
pride
.
<EOS>
He
would
bear
nothing
but
his
pride
.
<EOS>
And
in
his
pride
,
a
heap
of
inconsistency
,
and
misery
,
and
self
-
inflicted
torment
,
he
hated
her
.
  
<EOS>
To
the
moody
,
stubborn
,
sullen
demon
,
that
possessed
him
,
his
wife
opposed
her
different
pride
in
its
full
force
.
<EOS>
They
never
could
have
led
a
happy
life
together
;
but
nothing
could
have
made
it
more
unhappy
,
than
the
wilful
and
determined
warfare
of
such
elements
.
<EOS>
His
pride
was
set
upon
maintaining
his
magnificent
supremacy
,
and
forcing
recognition
of
it
from
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
been
racked
to
death
,
and
turned
but
<EOS>
her
haughty
glance
of
calm
inflexible
disdain
upon
him
,
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
Such
recognition
from
Edith
!
<EOS>
He
little
knew
through
what
a
storm
and
struggle
she
had
been
driven
onward
to
the
crowning
honour
of
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
little
knew
how
much
she
thought
she
had
conceded
,
when
she
suffered
him
to
call
her
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
was
resolved
to
show
her
that
he
was
supreme
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
no
will
but
his
.
<EOS>
Proud
<EOS>
he
desired
that
she
should
be
,
but
she
must
be
proud
for
,
not
against
him
.
<EOS>
As
he
sat
alone
,
hardening
,
he
would
often
hear
her
go
out
and
come
home
,
treading
the
round
of
London
life
with
no
more
heed
of
his
liking
or
disliking
,
pleasure
or
displeasure
,
than
if
he
had
been
her
groom
.
<EOS>
Her
cold
supreme
indifference
---
his
own
unquestioned
attribute
usurped
---
stung
him
more
than
any
other
kind
of
treatment
could
have
done
;
and
he
determined
to
bend
her
to
his
magnificent
and
stately
will
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
long
communing
with
these
thoughts
,
when
one
night
he
sought
her
in
her
own
apartment
,
after
he
had
heard
her
return
home
late
.
<EOS>
She
was
alone
,
in
her
brilliant
dress
,
and
had
but
that
moment
come
from
her
mother
's
room
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
melancholy
and
pensive
,
when
he
came
upon
her
;
but
it
marked
him
at
the
door
;
for
,
glancing
at
the
mirror
before
it
,
he
saw
immediately
,
as
in
a
picture
-
frame
,
the
knitted
brow
,
and
darkened
beauty
that
he
knew
so
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Dombey
,
"
he
said
,
entering
,
"
I
must
beg
leave
to
have
a
few
words
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
,
"
she
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
time
like
the
present
,
Madam
,
"
he
returned
.
<EOS>
"
You
mistake
your
position
.
<EOS>
I
am
used
to
choose
my
own
times
;
not
to
have
them
chosen
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
scarcely
understand
who
and
what
I
am
,
Mrs
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
she
answered
,
"
that
I
understand
you
very
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
upon
him
as
she
said
so
,
and
folding
her
white
arms
,
sparkling
with
gold
and
gems
,
upon
her
swelling
breast
,
turned
away
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
If
she
had
been
less
handsome
,
and
less
stately
in
her
cold
composure
,
she
might
not
have
had
the
power
of
impressing
him
with
the
sense
of
disadvantage
that
penetrated
through
his
utmost
pride
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
the
power
,
and
he
felt
it
keenly
.
<EOS>
He
glanced
round
the
room
:
saw
how
the
splendid
means
of
personal
adornment
,
and
the
luxuries
of
dress
,
were
scattered
here
and
there
,
and
disregarded
;
<EOS>
not
in
mere
caprice
and
carelessness
(
or
so
he
thought
)
,
<EOS>
but
in
a
steadfast
haughty
disregard
of
costly
things
:
and
felt
it
more
and
more
.
<EOS>
Chaplets
of
flowers
,
plumes
of
feathers
,
jewels
,
laces
,
silks
and
satins
;
look
where
he
would
,
he
saw
riches
,
despised
,
poured
out
,
and
made
of
no
account
.
<EOS>
The
very
diamonds
---
a
marriage
gift
---
that
rose
and
fell
impatiently
upon
her
bosom
,
seemed
to
pant
to
break
the
chain
that
clasped
them
round
her
neck
,
and
roll
down
on
the
floor
where
she
might
tread
upon
them
.
  
<EOS>
He
felt
his
disadvantage
,
and
he
showed
it
.
<EOS>
Solemn
and
strange
among
his
wealth
of
colour
and
voluptuous
glitter
,
strange
and
constrained
towards
its
haughty
mistress
,
whose
repellent
beauty
it
repeated
,
and
presented
all
around
him
,
as
in
so
many
fragments
of
a
mirror
<EOS>
,
he
was
conscious
of
embarrassment
and
awkwardness
.
<EOS>
Nothing
that
ministered
to
her
disdainful
self
-
possession
could
fail
to
gall
him
.
<EOS>
Galled
and
irritated
with
himself
,
he
sat
down
,
and
went
on
in
no
improved
humour
:
  
"
Mrs
Dombey
,
it
is
very
necessary
that
there
should
be
some
understanding
arrived
at
between
us
.
<EOS>
Your
conduct
does
not
please
Me
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
merely
glanced
at
him
again
,
and
again
averted
her
eyes
;
but
she
might
have
spoken
for
an
hour
,
and
expressed
less
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
,
Mrs
Dombey
,
does
not
please
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
taken
occasion
to
request
that
it
may
be
corrected
.
<EOS>
I
now
insist
upon
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
chose
a
fitting
occasion
for
your
first
remonstrance
,
Sir
,
and
you
adopt
a
fitting
manner
,
and
a
fitting
word
for
your
second
.
<EOS>
You
insist
!
<EOS>
To
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
with
his
most
offensive
air
of
state
,
"
I
have
made
you
my
wife
.
<EOS>
You
bear
my
name
.
<EOS>
You
are
associated
with
my
position
and
my
reputation
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
the
world
in
general
may
be
disposed
to
think
you
honoured
by
that
association
;
but
I
will
say
that
I
am
accustomed
to
"
insist
,
"
to
my
connections
and
dependents
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Which
may
you
be
pleased
to
consider
me
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Possibly
I
may
think
that
my
wife
should
partake
---
or
does
partake
,
and
can
not
help
herself
---
of
both
characters
,
Mrs
Dombey
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
bent
her
eyes
upon
him
steadily
,
and
set
her
trembling
lips
.
<EOS>
He
saw
her
bosom
throb
,
and
saw
her
face
flush
and
turn
white
.
<EOS>
All
this
he
could
know
,
and
did
:
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
know
that
one
word
was
whispering
in
the
deep
recesses
of
her
heart
,
to
keep
her
quiet
;
and
that
the
word
was
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
Blind
idiot
,
rushing
to
a
precipice
!
<EOS>
He
thought
she
stood
in
awe
of
him
!
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
too
expensive
,
Madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
extravagant
.
<EOS>
You
waste
a
great
deal
of
money
---
or
what
would
be
a
great
deal
in
the
pockets
of
most
gentlemen
---
in
cultivating
a
kind
of
society
that
is
useless
to
me
,
and
,
indeed
,
that
upon
the
whole
is
disagreeable
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
insist
upon
a
total
change
in
all
these
respects
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
in
the
novelty
of
possessing
a
tithe
of
such
means
as
Fortune
has
placed
at
your
disposal
,
ladies
are
apt
to
run
into
a
sudden
extreme
.
<EOS>
There
has
been
more
than
enough
of
that
extreme
.
<EOS>
I
beg
that
Mrs
Granger
's
very
different
experiences
may
now
come
to
the
instruction
of
Mrs
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Still
the
fixed
look
,
the
trembling
lips
,
the
throbbing
breast
,
the
face
now
crimson
and
now
white
;
and
still
the
deep
whisper
Florence
,
Florence
,
speaking
to
her
in
the
beating
of
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
His
insolence
of
self
-
importance
dilated
as
he
saw
this
alteration
in
her
.
<EOS>
Swollen
no
less
by
her
past
scorn
of
him
,
and
his
so
recent
feeling
of
disadvantage
,
than
by
her
present
submission
(
as
he
took
it
to
be
)
,
it
became
too
mighty
for
his
breast
,
and
burst
all
bounds
.
<EOS>
Why
,
who
could
long
resist
his
lofty
will
and
pleasure
!
<EOS>
He
had
resolved
to
conquer
her
,
and
look
here
!
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
further
please
,
Madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
in
a
tone
of
sovereign
command
,
"
to
understand
distinctly
,
that
I
am
to
be
deferred
to
and
obeyed
.
<EOS>
That
I
must
have
a
positive
show
and
confession
of
deference
before
the
world
,
Madam
.
<EOS>
I
am
used
to
this
.
<EOS>
I
require
it
as
my
right
.
<EOS>
In
short
I
will
have
it
.
<EOS>
I
consider
it
no
unreasonable
return
for
the
worldly
advancement
that
has
befallen
you
;
and
I
believe
nobody
will
be
surprised
,
either
at
its
being
required
from
you
,
or
at
your
making
it
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
To
Me
---
To
Me
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
with
emphasis
.
  
<EOS>
No
word
from
her
.
<EOS>
No
change
in
her
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
learnt
from
your
mother
,
Mrs
Dombey
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
with
magisterial
importance
,
"
what
no
doubt
you
know
,
namely
,
that
Brighton
is
recommended
for
her
health
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
has
been
so
good
"
  
<EOS>
She
changed
suddenly
.
<EOS>
Her
face
and
bosom
glowed
as
if
the
red
light
of
an
angry
sunset
had
been
flung
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Not
unobservant
of
the
change
,
and
putting
his
own
interpretation
upon
it
,
Mr
Dombey
resumed
:
  
"
Mr
Carker
has
been
so
good
as
to
go
down
and
secure
a
house
there
,
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
On
the
return
of
the
establishment
to
London
,
I
shall
take
such
steps
for
its
better
management
as
I
consider
necessary
.
<EOS>
One
of
these
,
will
be
the
engagement
at
Brighton
<EOS>
(
if
it
is
to
be
effected
)
,
of
a
very
respectable
reduced
person
there
,
a
Mrs
Pipchin
,
formerly
employed
in
a
situation
of
trust
in
my
family
,
to
act
as
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
An
establishment
like
this
,
presided
over
but
nominally
,
Mrs
Dombey
,
requires
a
competent
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
changed
her
attitude
before
he
arrived
at
these
words
,
and
now
sat
---
still
looking
at
him
fixedly
---
turning
a
bracelet
round
and
round
upon
her
arm
;
not
winding
it
about
with
a
light
,
womanly
touch
,
but
pressing
and
dragging
it
over
the
smooth
skin
,
until
the
white
limb
showed
a
bar
of
red
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
observed
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
---
"
and
this
concludes
what
I
deem
it
necessary
to
say
to
you
at
present
,
Mrs
Dombey
<EOS>
---
I
observed
a
moment
ago
,
Madam
,
that
my
allusion
to
Mr
Carker
was
received
in
a
peculiar
manner
.
<EOS>
On
the
occasion
of
my
happening
to
point
out
to
you
,
before
that
confidential
agent
,
the
objection
I
had
to
your
mode
of
receiving
my
visitors
,
you
were
pleased
to
object
to
his
presence
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
to
get
the
better
of
that
objection
,
Madam
,
and
to
accustom
yourself
to
it
very
probably
on
many
similar
occasions
;
unless
you
adopt
the
remedy
which
is
in
your
own
hands
,
of
giving
me
no
cause
of
complaint
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
who
,
after
the
emotion
he
had
just
seen
,
set
great
store
by
this
means
of
reducing
his
proud
wife
,
and
who
was
perhaps
sufficiently
willing
to
exhibit
his
power
to
that
gentleman
in
a
new
and
triumphant
aspect
,
"
Mr
Carker
being
in
my
confidence
,
Mrs
Dombey
,
may
very
well
be
in
yours
to
such
an
extent
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
Mrs
Dombey
,
"
he
continued
,
after
a
few
moments
,
during
which
,
in
his
increasing
haughtiness
,
he
had
improved
on
his
idea
,
"
I
may
not
find
it
necessary
ever
to
intrust
Mr
Carker
with
any
message
of
objection
or
remonstrance
to
you
;
but
as
it
would
be
derogatory
to
my
position
and
reputation
to
be
frequently
holding
trivial
disputes
with
a
lady
upon
whom
I
have
conferred
the
highest
distinction
that
it
is
in
my
power
to
bestow
,
I
shall
not
scruple
to
avail
myself
of
his
services
if
I
see
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
he
thought
,
rising
in
his
moral
magnificence
,
and
rising
a
stiffer
and
more
impenetrable
man
than
ever
,
"
she
knows
me
and
my
resolution
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
hand
that
had
so
pressed
the
bracelet
was
laid
heavily
upon
her
breast
,
but
she
looked
at
him
still
,
with
an
unaltered
face
,
and
said
in
a
low
voice
:
  
"
<EOS>
Wait
!
<EOS>
For
God
's
sake
!
<EOS>
I
must
speak
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Why
did
she
not
,
and
what
was
the
inward
struggle
that
rendered
her
incapable
of
doing
so
,
for
minutes
,
while
,
in
the
strong
constraint
she
put
upon
her
face
,
it
was
as
fixed
as
any
statue
's
---
looking
upon
him
with
neither
yielding
nor
unyielding
,
liking
nor
hatred
,
pride
nor
humility
:
nothing
but
a
searching
gaze
?
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
ever
tempt
you
to
seek
my
hand
?
<EOS>
Did
I
ever
use
any
art
to
win
you
?
<EOS>
Was
I
ever
more
conciliating
to
you
when
you
pursued
me
,
than
I
have
been
since
our
marriage
?
<EOS>
Was
I
ever
other
to
you
than
I
am
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
wholly
unnecessary
,
Madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
to
enter
upon
such
discussions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
think
I
loved
you
?
<EOS>
Did
you
know
I
did
not
?
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
care
,
Man
!
<EOS>
for
my
heart
,
or
propose
to
yourself
to
win
the
worthless
thing
?
<EOS>
Was
there
any
poor
pretence
of
any
in
our
bargain
?
<EOS>
Upon
your
side
,
or
on
mine
?
"
  
"
These
questions
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
are
all
wide
of
the
purpose
,
Madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
moved
between
him
and
the
door
to
prevent
his
going
away
,
and
drawing
her
majestic
figure
to
its
height
,
looked
steadily
upon
him
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
answer
each
of
them
.
<EOS>
You
answer
me
before
I
speak
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
How
can
you
help
it
;
you
who
know
the
miserable
truth
as
well
as
I
?
<EOS>
Now
,
tell
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
loved
you
to
devotion
,
could
I
do
more
than
render
up
my
whole
will
and
being
to
you
,
as
you
have
just
demanded
?
<EOS>
If
my
heart
were
pure
and
all
untried
,
and
you
its
idol
,
could
you
ask
more
;
could
you
have
more
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Possibly
not
,
Madam
,
"
he
returned
coolly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
how
different
I
am
.
<EOS>
You
see
me
looking
on
you
now
,
and
you
can
read
the
warmth
of
passion
for
you
that
is
breathing
in
my
face
.
"
<EOS>
Not
a
curl
of
the
proud
lip
,
not
a
flash
of
the
dark
eye
,
nothing
but
the
same
intent
and
searching
look
,
accompanied
these
words
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
my
general
history
.
<EOS>
You
have
spoken
of
my
mother
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
you
can
degrade
,
or
bend
or
break
,
me
to
submission
and
obedience
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
smiled
,
as
he
might
have
smiled
at
an
inquiry
whether
he
thought
he
could
raise
ten
thousand
pounds
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
there
is
anything
unusual
here
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
slight
motion
of
her
hand
before
her
brow
,
which
did
not
for
a
moment
flinch
from
its
immovable
and
otherwise
expressionless
gaze
,
"
as
I
know
there
are
unusual
feelings
here
,
"
raising
the
hand
she
pressed
upon
her
bosom
,
and
heavily
returning
it
,
"
consider
that
there
is
no
common
meaning
in
the
appeal
I
am
going
to
make
you
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
for
I
am
going
;
"
she
said
it
as
in
prompt
reply
to
something
in
his
face
;
"
to
appeal
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
with
a
slightly
condescending
bend
of
his
chin
that
rustled
and
crackled
his
stiff
cravat
,
sat
down
on
a
sofa
that
was
near
him
,
to
hear
the
appeal
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
can
believe
that
I
am
of
such
a
nature
now
,
"
---
he
fancied
he
saw
tears
glistening
in
her
eyes
,
and
he
thought
,
complacently
,
that
he
had
forced
them
from
her
,
though
none
fell
on
her
cheek
,
and
she
regarded
him
as
steadily
as
ever
,
---
"
as
would
make
what
I
now
say
almost
incredible
to
myself
,
said
to
any
man
who
had
become
my
husband
,
but
,
above
all
,
said
to
you
,
<EOS>
you
may
,
perhaps
,
attach
the
greater
weight
to
it
.
<EOS>
In
the
dark
end
to
which
we
are
tending
,
and
may
come
,
we
shall
not
involve
ourselves
alone
(
that
might
not
be
much
)
but
others
.
"
  
<EOS>
Others
!
<EOS>
He
knew
at
whom
that
word
pointed
,
and
frowned
heavily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
speak
to
you
for
the
sake
of
others
.
<EOS>
Also
your
own
sake
;
and
for
mine
.
<EOS>
Since
our
marriage
,
you
have
been
arrogant
to
me
;
and
I
have
repaid
you
in
kind
.
<EOS>
You
have
shown
to
me
and
every
one
around
us
,
every
day
and
hour
,
that
you
think
I
am
graced
and
distinguished
by
your
alliance
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
so
,
and
have
shown
that
too
.
<EOS>
It
seems
you
do
not
understand
,
or
(
so
far
as
your
power
can
go
)
intend
that
each
of
us
shall
take
a
separate
course
;
and
you
expect
from
me
instead
,
a
homage
you
will
never
have
.
"
  
<EOS>
Although
her
face
was
still
the
same
,
there
was
emphatic
confirmation
of
this
"
Never
"
in
the
very
breath
she
drew
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
no
tenderness
towards
you
;
that
you
know
.
<EOS>
You
would
care
nothing
for
it
,
if
I
did
or
could
.
<EOS>
I
know
as
well
that
you
feel
none
towards
me
.
<EOS>
But
we
are
linked
together
;
and
in
the
knot
that
ties
us
,
as
I
have
said
,
others
are
bound
up
.
<EOS>
We
must
both
die
;
we
are
both
connected
with
the
dead
already
,
each
by
a
little
child
.
<EOS>
Let
us
forbear
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
took
a
long
respiration
,
as
if
he
would
have
said
,
Oh
!
<EOS>
was
this
all
!
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
wealth
,
"
she
went
on
,
turning
paler
as
she
watched
him
,
while
her
eyes
grew
yet
more
lustrous
in
their
earnestness
,
"
that
could
buy
these
words
of
me
,
and
the
meaning
that
belongs
to
them
.
<EOS>
Once
cast
away
as
idle
breath
,
no
wealth
or
power
can
bring
them
back
.
<EOS>
I
mean
them
;
I
have
weighed
them
;
and
I
will
be
true
to
what
I
undertake
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
promise
to
forbear
on
your
part
,
I
will
promise
to
forbear
on
mine
.
<EOS>
We
are
a
most
unhappy
pair
,
in
whom
,
from
different
causes
,
every
sentiment
that
blesses
marriage
,
or
justifies
it
,
is
rooted
out
;
but
in
the
course
of
time
,
some
friendship
,
or
some
fitness
for
each
other
,
may
arise
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
will
try
to
hope
so
,
if
you
will
make
the
endeavour
too
;
and
I
will
look
forward
to
a
better
and
a
happier
use
of
age
than
I
have
made
of
youth
or
prime
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Throughout
she
had
spoken
in
a
low
plain
voice
,
that
neither
rose
nor
fell
;
ceasing
<EOS>
,
she
dropped
the
hand
with
which
she
had
enforced
herself
to
be
so
passionless
and
distinct
,
but
not
the
eyes
with
which
she
had
so
steadily
observed
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
with
his
utmost
dignity
,
"
I
can
not
entertain
any
proposal
of
this
extraordinary
nature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
yet
,
without
the
least
change
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
rising
as
he
spoke
,
"
consent
to
temporise
or
treat
with
you
,
Mrs
Dombey
,
upon
a
subject
as
to
which
you
are
in
possession
of
my
opinions
and
expectations
.
<EOS>
I
have
stated
my
ultimatum
,
Madam
,
and
have
only
to
request
your
very
serious
attention
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
To
see
the
face
change
to
its
old
expression
,
deepened
in
intensity
!
<EOS>
To
see
the
eyes
droop
as
from
some
mean
and
odious
object
!
<EOS>
To
see
the
lighting
of
the
haughty
brow
!
<EOS>
To
see
scorn
,
anger
,
indignation
,
and
abhorrence
starting
into
sight
,
and
the
pale
blank
earnestness
vanish
like
a
mist
!
<EOS>
He
could
not
choose
but
look
,
although
he
looked
to
his
dismay
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
,
Sir
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
pointing
with
an
imperious
hand
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
Our
first
and
last
confidence
is
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
make
us
stranger
to
each
other
than
we
are
henceforth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
take
my
rightful
course
,
Madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
undeterred
,
you
may
be
sure
,
by
any
general
declamation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
turned
her
back
upon
him
,
and
,
without
reply
,
sat
down
before
her
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
place
my
reliance
on
your
improved
sense
of
duty
,
and
more
correct
feeling
,
and
better
reflection
,
Madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
She
answered
not
one
word
.
<EOS>
He
saw
no
more
expression
of
any
heed
of
him
,
in
the
mirror
,
than
if
he
had
been
an
unseen
spider
on
the
wall
,
or
beetle
on
the
floor
,
or
rather
,
than
if
he
had
been
the
one
or
other
,
seen
and
crushed
when
she
last
turned
from
him
,
and
forgotten
among
the
ignominious
and
dead
vermin
of
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
He
looked
back
,
as
he
went
out
at
the
door
,
upon
the
welllighted
and
luxurious
room
,
the
beautiful
and
glittering
objects
everywhere
displayed
,
the
shape
of
Edith
in
its
rich
dress
seated
before
her
glass
,
and
the
face
of
Edith
as
the
glass
presented
it
to
him
;
and
betook
himself
to
his
old
chamber
of
cogitation
,
carrying
away
with
him
a
vivid
picture
in
his
mind
of
all
these
things
,
and
a
rambling
and
unaccountable
speculation
(
such
as
sometimes
comes
into
a
man
's
head
)
<EOS>
how
they
would
all
look
when
he
saw
them
next
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
rest
,
Mr
Dombey
was
very
taciturn
,
and
very
dignified
,
and
very
confident
of
carrying
out
his
purpose
;
and
remained
so
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
design
accompanying
the
family
to
Brighton
;
but
he
graciously
informed
Cleopatra
at
breakfast
,
on
the
morning
of
departure
,
which
arrived
a
day
or
two
afterwards
,
that
he
might
be
expected
down
,
soon
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
time
to
be
lost
in
getting
Cleopatra
to
any
place
recommended
as
being
salutary
;
for
,
indeed
,
she
seemed
upon
the
wane
,
and
turning
of
the
earth
,
earthy
.
  
<EOS>
Without
having
undergone
any
decided
second
attack
of
her
malady
,
the
old
woman
seemed
to
have
crawled
backward
in
her
recovery
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
She
was
more
lean
and
shrunken
,
more
uncertain
in
her
imbecility
,
and
made
stranger
confusions
in
her
mind
and
memory
.
<EOS>
Among
other
symptoms
of
this
last
affliction
,
she
fell
into
the
habit
of
confounding
the
names
of
her
two
sons
-
in
-
law
,
the
living
and
the
deceased
;
and
in
general
called
Mr
Dombey
,
either
"
Grangeby
,
"
or
"
Domber
,
"
or
indifferently
,
both
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
was
youthful
,
very
youthful
still
;
and
in
her
youthfulness
appeared
at
breakfast
,
before
going
away
,
in
a
new
bonnet
made
express
,
and
a
travelling
robe
that
was
embroidered
and
braided
like
an
old
baby
's
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
easy
to
put
her
into
a
fly
-
away
bonnet
now
,
or
to
keep
the
bonnet
in
its
place
on
the
back
of
her
poor
nodding
head
,
when
it
was
got
on
.
<EOS>
In
this
instance
,
it
had
not
only
the
extraneous
effect
of
being
always
on
one
side
,
but
of
being
perpetually
tapped
on
the
crown
by
Flowers
the
maid
,
who
attended
in
the
background
during
breakfast
to
perform
that
duty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
dearest
Grangeby
,
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
"
you
must
posively
prom
,
<EOS>
"
she
cut
some
of
her
words
short
,
and
cut
out
others
altogether
,
"
come
down
very
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
just
now
,
Madam
,
"
returned
Mr
Dombey
,
loudly
and
laboriously
,
"
that
I
am
coming
in
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
,
Domber
!
"
  
<EOS>
Here
the
Major
,
who
was
come
to
take
leave
of
the
ladies
,
and
who
was
staring
through
his
apoplectic
eyes
at
Mrs
Skewton
's
face
,
with
the
disinterested
composure
of
an
immortal
being
,
said
:
  
"
<EOS>
Begad
,
Ma'am
,
you
do
n't
ask
old
Joe
to
come
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sterious
wretch
,
who
's
he
?
"
lisped
Cleopatra
.
<EOS>
But
a
tap
on
the
bonnet
from
Flowers
seeming
to
jog
her
memory
,
she
added
,
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
You
mean
yourself
,
you
naughty
creature
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Devilish
queer
,
Sir
,
"
whispered
the
Major
to
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Bad
case
.
<EOS>
Never
did
wrap
up
enough
;
"
the
Major
being
buttoned
to
the
chin
.
<EOS>
"
Why
who
should
JB
mean
by
Joe
,
but
old
Joe
Bagstock
---
Joseph
---
your
slave
---
Joe
,
Ma'am
?
<EOS>
Here!Here
's
the
man
!
<EOS>
Here
are
the
Bagstock
bellows
,
Ma'am
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
Major
,
striking
himself
a
sounding
blow
on
the
chest
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Edith
---
Grangeby
---
it
's
most
trordinry
thing
,
"
said
Cleopatra
,
pettishly
,
"
that
Major
---
"
  
"
Bagstock
!
JB
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
Major
,
seeing
that
she
faltered
for
his
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
do
n't
matter
,
"
said
Cleopatra
.
<EOS>
"
Edith
,
my
love
,
you
know
I
never
could
remember
names
---
what
was
it
?
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
most
trordinry
thing
that
so
many
people
want
to
come
down
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
going
for
long
.
<EOS>
I
'm
coming
back
.
<EOS>
Surely
they
can
wait
,
till
I
come
back
!
"
  
<EOS>
Cleopatra
looked
all
round
the
table
as
she
said
it
,
and
appeared
very
uneasy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
have
visitors
---
really
do
n't
want
visitors
,
"
she
said
;
"
little
repose
---
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
---
is
what
I
quire
.
<EOS>
No
odious
brutes
must
proach
me
till
I
've
shaken
off
this
numbness
;
"
and
in
a
grisly
resumption
of
her
coquettish
ways
,
she
made
a
dab
at
the
Major
with
her
fan
,
but
overset
Mr
Dombey
's
breakfast
cup
instead
,
which
was
in
quite
a
different
direction
.
  
<EOS>
Then
she
called
for
Withers
,
and
charged
him
to
see
particularly
that
word
was
left
about
some
trivial
alterations
in
her
room
,
which
must
be
all
made
before
she
came
back
,
and
which
must
be
set
about
immediately
,
as
there
was
no
saying
how
soon
she
might
come
back
;
for
she
had
a
great
many
engagements
,
and
all
sorts
of
people
to
call
upon
.
<EOS>
Withers
received
these
directions
with
becoming
deference
,
and
gave
his
guarantee
for
their
execution
;
but
when
he
withdrew
a
pace
or
two
behind
her
,
it
appeared
as
if
he
could
n't
help
looking
strangely
at
the
Major
,
who
could
n't
help
looking
strangely
at
Mr
Dombey
,
who
could
n't
help
looking
strangely
at
Cleopatra
,
who
could
n't
help
nodding
her
bonnet
over
one
eye
,
and
rattling
her
knife
and
fork
upon
her
plate
in
using
them
,
as
if
she
were
playing
castanets
.
  
<EOS>
Edith
alone
never
lifted
her
eyes
to
any
face
at
the
table
,
and
never
seemed
dismayed
by
anything
her
mother
said
or
did
.
<EOS>
She
listened
to
her
disjointed
talk
,
or
at
least
,
turned
her
head
towards
her
when
addressed
;
replied
in
a
few
low
words
when
necessary
;
and
sometimes
stopped
her
when
she
was
rambling
,
or
brought
her
thoughts
back
with
a
monosyllable
,
to
the
point
from
which
they
had
strayed
.
<EOS>
The
mother
,
however
unsteady
in
other
things
,
was
constant
in
this
---
that
she
was
always
observant
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
look
at
the
beautiful
face
,
in
its
marble
stillness
and
severity
,
now
with
a
kind
of
fearful
admiration
;
now
in
a
giggling
foolish
effort
to
move
it
to
a
smile
;
now
with
capricious
tears
and
jealous
shakings
of
her
head
,
as
imagining
herself
neglected
by
it
;
always
with
an
attraction
towards
it
,
that
never
fluctuated
like
her
other
ideas
,
but
had
constant
possession
of
her
.
<EOS>
From
Edith
she
would
sometimes
look
at
Florence
,
and
back
again
at
Edith
,
in
a
manner
that
was
wild
enough
;
and
sometimes
she
would
try
to
look
elsewhere
,
as
if
to
escape
from
her
daughter
's
face
;
but
back
to
it
she
seemed
forced
to
come
,
although
it
never
sought
hers
unless
sought
,
or
troubled
her
with
one
single
glance
.

The
breakfast
concluded
,
Mrs
Skewton
,
affecting
to
lean
girlishly
upon
the
Major
's
arm
,
but
heavily
supported
on
the
other
side
by
Flowers
the
maid
,
and
propped
up
behind
by
Withers
the
page
,
was
conducted
to
the
carriage
,
which
was
to
take
her
,
Florence
,
and
Edith
to
Brighton
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
is
Joseph
absolutely
banished
?
"
said
the
Major
,
thrusting
in
his
purple
face
over
the
steps
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Damme
,
Ma'am
,
is
Cleopatra
so
hard
-
hearted
as
to
forbid
her
faithful
Antony
Bagstock
to
approach
the
presence
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
along

"
<EOS>
said
Cleopatra
,
"
I

<EOS>
You

"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
Joseph
,
he
may
live
in
hope
,
Ma'am

"
said
the
Major
;
"
or
he
'll
die
in
despair
.
"
   
<EOS>
Cleopatra
shuddered
,
and
leaned
back
.
<EOS>
"
Edith
,
my
dear

"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
---
"
  
"
What
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Such
dreadful
words
,
"
said
Cleopatra
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
uses
such
dreadful
words
!
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
signed
to
him
to
retire
,
gave
the
word
to
go
on
,
and
left
the
objectionable
Major
to
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
To
whom
he
returned
,
whistling
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Major
,
with
his
hands
behind
him
,
and
his
legs
very
wide
asunder
,
"
a
fair
friend
of
ours
has
removed
to
Queer
Street
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
Major
?
"
inquired
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
say
,
Dombey
,
"
returned
the
Major
,
"
that
you
'll
soon
be
an
orphan
-
in
-
law
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
appeared
to
relish
this
waggish
description
of
himself
so
very
little
,
that
the
Major
wound
up
with
the
horse
's
cough
,
as
an
expression
of
gravity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Damme
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Major
,
"
there
is
no
use
in
disguising
a
fact
.
<EOS>
Joe
is
blunt
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
That
's
his
nature
.
<EOS>
If
you
take
old
Josh
at
all

you
take
him

you

him

a

of

close

toothed

<EOS>
Dombey

"
said
the
Major
,
"
your
wife

mother

on
the
move
,
Sir

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
,
"
returned
Mr
Dombey
,
with
much
philosophy
,
"
that
Mrs
Skewton
is
shaken
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Shaken
,
Dombey

"
said
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
Smashed

"
  
<EOS>
"
Change
,
however
,
"
pursued
Mr
Dombey
,
"
and
attention
may
do
much
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
believe
it
,
Sir
,
"
returned
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Damme
,
Sir
,
she
never
wrapped
up
enough
.
<EOS>
If
a
man
do
n't
wrap
up
,
"
said
the
Major
,
taking
in
another
button
of
his
buff
waistcoat
,
"
he
has
nothing
to
fall
back
upon

<EOS>
But
some

<EOS>
They

do
it

<EOS>
Damme

they
will

<EOS>
They
're
obstinate

<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
,
Dombey
,
it
may
not
be
ornamental
;
it
may
not
be
refined
;
it
may
be
rough
and
tough
;
but
a
little
of
the
genuine
old
English
Bagstock
stamina
,
Sir
,
would
do
all
the
good
in
the
world
to
the
human
breed
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
imparting
this
precious
piece
of
information
,
the
Major
,
who
was
certainly
true
-
blue
,
whatever
other
endowments
he
may
have
possessed
or
wanted
,
coming
within
the
"
genuine
old
English
"
classification
,
which
has
never
been
exactly
ascertained
,
took
his
lobster
-
eyes
and
his
apoplexy
to
the
club
,
and
choked
there
all
day
.
  
<EOS>
Cleopatra
,
at
one
time
fretful
,
at
another
self
-
complacent
,
sometimes
awake
,
sometimes
asleep
,
and
at
all
times
juvenile
,
reached
Brighton
the
same
night
,
fell
to
pieces
as
usual
,
and
was
put
away
in
bed
;
where
a
gloomy
fancy
might
have
pictured
a
more
potent
skeleton
than
the
maid
,
who
should
have
been
one
,
watching
at
the
rose
-
coloured
curtains
,
which
were
carried
down
to
shed
their
bloom
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
settled
in
high
council
of
medical
authority
that
she
should
take
a
carriage
airing
every
day
,
and
that
it
was
important
she
should
get
out
every
day
,
and
walk
if
she
could
.
<EOS>
Edith
was
ready
to
attend
her
---
always
ready
to
attend
her
,
with
the
same
mechanical
attention
and
immoveable
beauty
---
and
they
drove
out
alone
;
for
Edith
had
an
uneasiness
in
the
presence
of
Florence
,
now
that
her
mother
was
worse
,
and
told
Florence
,
with
a
kiss
,
that
she
would
rather
they
two
went
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
,
on
one
particular
day
,
was
in
the
irresolute
,
exacting
,
jealous
temper
that
had
developed
itself
on
her
recovery
from
her
first
attack
.
<EOS>
After
sitting
silent
in
the
carriage
watching
Edith
for
some
time
,
she
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
passionately
.
<EOS>
The
hand
was
neither
given
nor
withdrawn
,
but
simply
yielded
to
her
raising
of
it
,
and
being
released
,
dropped
down
again
,
almost
as
if
it
were
insensible
.
<EOS>
At
this
she
began
to
whimper
and
moan
,
and
say
what
a
mother
she
had
been
,
and
how
she
was
forgotten
!
<EOS>
This
she
continued
to
do
at
capricious
intervals
,
even
when
they
had
alighted
:
when
she
herself
was
halting
along
with
the
joint
support
of
Withers
and
a
stick
,
and
Edith
was
walking
by
her
side
,
and
the
carriage
slowly
following
at
a
little
distance
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
bleak
,
lowering
,
windy
day
,
and
they
were
out
upon
the
Downs
with
nothing
but
a
bare
sweep
of
land
between
them
and
the
sky
.
<EOS>
The
mother
,
with
a
querulous
satisfaction
in
the
monotony
of
her
complaint
,
was
still
repeating
it
in
a
low
voice
from
time
to
time
,
and
the
proud
form
of
her
daughter
moved
beside
her
slowly
,
when
there
came
advancing
over
a
dark
ridge
before
them
,
two
other
figures
,
which
in
the
distance
,
were
so
like
an
exaggerated
imitation
of
their
own
,
that
Edith
stopped
.
  
<EOS>
Almost
as
she
stopped
,
the
two
figures
stopped
;
and
that
one
which
to
Edith
's
thinking
was
like
a
distorted
shadow
of
her
mother
,
spoke
to
the
other
,
earnestly
,
and
with
a
pointing
hand
towards
them
.
<EOS>
That
one
seemed
inclined
to
turn
back
,
but
the
other
,
in
which
Edith
recognised
enough
that
was
like
herself
to
strike
her
with
an
unusual
feeling
,
not
quite
free
from
fear
,
came
on
;
and
then
they
came
on
together
.
  
<EOS>
The
greater
part
of
this
observation
,
she
made
while
walking
towards
them
,
for
her
stoppage
had
been
momentary
.
<EOS>
Nearer
observation
sowed
her
that
they
were
poorly
dressed
,
as
wanderers
about
the
country
;
that
the
younger
woman
carried
knitted
work
or
some
such
goods
for
sale
;
and
that
the
old
one
toiled
on
empty
-
handed
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
,
however
far
removed
she
was
in
dress
,
in
dignity
,
in
beauty
<EOS>
,
Edith
could
not
but
compare
the
younger
woman
with
herself
,
still
.
<EOS>
It
may
have
been
that
she
saw
upon
her
face
some
traces
which
she
knew
were
lingering
in
her
own
soul
,
if
not
yet
written
on
that
index
;
but
,
as
the
woman
came
on
,
returning
her
gaze
,
fixing
her
shining
eyes
upon
her
,
undoubtedly
presenting
something
of
her
own
air
and
stature
,
and
appearing
to
reciprocate
her
own
thoughts
,
she
felt
a
chill
creep
over
her
,
as
if
the
day
were
darkening
,
and
the
wind
were
colder
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
now
come
up
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
holding
out
her
hand
importunately
,
stopped
to
beg
of
Mrs
Skewton
.
<EOS>
The
younger
one
stopped
too
,
and
she
and
Edith
looked
in
one
another
's
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
that
you
have
to
sell
?
"
said
Edith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
this
,
"
returned
the
woman
,
holding
out
her
wares
,
without
looking
at
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
sold
myself
long
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lady
,
do
n't
believe
her
,
"
croaked
the
old
woman
to
Mrs
Skewton
;
"
do
n't
believe
what
she
says
.
<EOS>
She
loves
to
talk
like
that
.
<EOS>
She
's
my
handsome
and
undutiful
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
gives
me
nothing
but
reproaches
,
my
lady
,
for
all
I
have
done
for
her
.
<EOS>
Look
at
her
now
,
my
lady
,
how
she
turns
upon
her
poor
old
mother
with
her
looks
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
Mrs
Skewton
drew
her
purse
out
with
a
trembling
hand
,
and
eagerly
fumbled
for
some
money
,
which
the
other
old
woman
greedily
watched
for
---
their
heads
all
but
touching
,
in
their
hurry
and
decrepitude
---
<EOS>
Edith
interposed
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
you
,
"
addressing
the
old
woman
,
"
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes

my
lady
,
"
with
a
curtsey
.
"
Down
in
Warwickshire
.
<EOS>
The
morning
among
the
trees
.
<EOS>
When
you
would
n't
give
me
nothing

<EOS>
But
the
gentleman
,
he
give
me
something

<EOS>
Oh

bless

"
<EOS>
mumbled
the
old
woman
,
holding
up
her
skinny
hand
,
and
grinning
frightfully
at
her
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
of
no
use
attempting
to
stay
me
,
Edith
!
"
said
Mrs
Skewton
,
angrily
anticipating
an
objection
from
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
nothing
about

<EOS>
I
wo
n't
be
dissuaded

<EOS>
I

"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes

my

chattered
the
old
woman
,
holding
out
her
avaricious
hand
.

"
Thankee

And
treated

my
good

said
Mrs
Skewton
,
whimpering
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
There

<EOS>
Shake
hands

<EOS>

<EOS>
And
now

can
go

addressing
the
daughter
,
"
you
'll
show
more
gratitude
,
and
natural
what'sits

all
the

Come

"
  
<EOS>
As
the
ruin
of
Cleopatra
tottered
off
whimpering
,
and
wiping
its
eyes
with
a
gingerly
remembrance
of
rouge
in
their
neighbourhood
,
the
old
woman
hobbled
another
way
,
mumbling
and
counting
her
money
.
<EOS>
Not
one
word
more
,
nor
one
other
gesture
,
had
been
exchanged
between
Edith
and
the
younger
woman
,
but
neither
had
removed
her
eyes
from
the
other
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
They
had
remained
confronted
until
now
,
when
Edith
,
as
awakening
from
a
dream
,
passed
slowly
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're

muttered
her
shadow
,
looking
after
her
;
"

good

And

New

<EOS>
ALL
is
going
on
as
it
was
wo
nt
.
<EOS>
The
waves
are
hoarse
with
repetition
of
their
mystery
;
the
dust
lies
piled
upon
the
shore
;
the
sea
-
birds
soar
and
hover
;
the
winds
and
clouds
go
forth
upon
their
trackless
flight
;
the
white
arms
beckon
,
in
the
moonlight
to
the
invisible
country
far
away

<EOS>
With
a
tender
melancholy
pleasure
,
Florence
finds
herself
again
on
the
old
ground
so
sadly
trodden
,
yet
so
happily
,
and
thinks
of
him
in
the
quiet
place
,
where
he
and
she
have
many
and
many
a
time
conversed
together
,
with
the
water
welling
up
about
his
couch
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
as
she
sits
pensive
there
,
she
hears
in
the
wild
low
murmur
of
the
sea
,
his
little
story
told
again
,
his
very
words
repeated
;
and
finds
that
all
her
life
and
hopes
,
and
griefs
,
since
---
in
the
solitary
house
,
and
in
the
pageant
it
has
changed
to

have
a
portion
in
the
burden
of
the
marvellous
song

And
gentle
Mr

wanders
at

looking
wistfully
towards
the
figure

he
dotes
upon

and
has
followed
there
,
but
can
not
in
his
delicacy
disturb
at
such
a
time
,
likewise
hears
the
requiem
of
little
Dombey
on
the
waters
,
rising
and
falling
in
the
lulls
of
their
eternal
madrigal
in
praise
of
Florence
.
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
and
he
faintly
understands
,
poor
Mr
Toots
,
that
they
are
saying
something
of
a
time
when
he
was
sensible
of
being
brighter
and
not
addle
-
brained
;
and
the
tears
rising
in
his
eyes
when
he
fears
that
he
is
dull
and
stupid
now
,
and
good
for
little
but
to
be
laughed
at
,
diminish
his
satisfaction
in
their
soothing
reminder
that
he
is
relieved
from
present
responsibility
to
the
Chicken
,
by
the
absence
of
that
game
head
of
poultry
in
the
country
,
training
(
at
Toots
's
cost
)
for
his
great
mill
with
the
Larkey
Boy
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mr
Toots
takes
courage
,
when
they
whisper
a
kind
thought
to
him
;
and
by
slow
degrees
and
with
many
indecisive
stoppages
on
the
way
,
approaches
Florence
.
<EOS>
Stammering
and
blushing
,
Mr
Toots
affects
amazement
when
he
comes
near
her
,
and
says
(
having
followed
close
on
the
carriage
in
which
she
travelled
,
every
inch
of
the
way
from
London
,
loving
even
to
be
choked
by
the
dust
of
its
wheels
)
that
he
never
was
so
surprised
in
all
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
've
brought
Diogenes
,
too
,
Miss
Dombey
!
"
says
Mr
Toots
,
thrilled
through
and
through
by
the
touch
of
the
small
hand
so
pleasantly
and
frankly
given
him
.
  
<EOS>
No
doubt
Diogenes
is
there
,
and
no
doubt
Mr
Toots
has
reason
to
observe
him
,
for
he
comes
straightway
at
Mr
Toots
's
legs
,
and
tumbles
over
himself
in
the
desperation
with
which
he
makes
at
him
,
like
a
very
dog
of
Montargis
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
checked
by
his
sweet
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
"
Down
,
Di
,
down
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
who
first
made
us
friends
,
Di

<EOS>
For
shame
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
Well
may
Di
lay
his
loving
cheek
against
her
hand
,
and
run
off
,
and
run
back
,
and
run
round
her
,
barking
,
and
run
headlong
at
anybody
coming
by
,
to
show
his
devotion
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
would
run
headlong
at
anybody
,
too
.
<EOS>
A
military
gentleman
goes
past
,
and
Mr
Toots
would
like
nothing
better
than
to
run
at
him
,
full
tilt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Diogenes
is
quite
in
his
native
air
,
is
n't
he
,
Miss
Dombey
?
"
says
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
assents
,
with
a
grateful
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dombey
,
"
says
Mr
Toots
,
"
beg
your
pardon
,
but
if
you
would
like
to
walk
to
Blimber
's
,
I
---
I
'm
going
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
puts
her
arm
in
that
of
Mr
Toots
without
a
word
,
and
they
walk
away
together
,
with
Diogenes
going
on
before
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
's
legs
shake
under
him
;
and
though
he
is
splendidly
dressed
,
he
feels
misfits
,
and
sees
wrinkles
,
in
the
masterpieces
of
Burgess
and
Co.
,
and
wishes
he
had
put
on
that
brightest
pair
of
boots
.
  
<EOS>
Doctor
Blimber
's
house
,
outside
,
has
as
scholastic
and
studious
an
air
as
ever
:
and
up
there
is
the
window
where
she
used
to
look
for
the
pale
face
,
and
where
the
pale
face
brightened
when
it
saw
her
,
and
the
wasted
little
hand
waved
kisses
as
she
passed
.
<EOS>
The
door
is
opened
by
the
same
weakeyed
young
man
,
whose
imbecility
of
grin
at
sight
of
Mr
Toots
is
feebleness
of
character
personified
.
<EOS>
They
are
shown
into
the
Doctor
's
study
,
where
blind
Homer
and
Minerva
give
them
audience
as
of
yore
,
to
the
sober
ticking
of
the
great
clock
in
the
hall
;
and
where
the
globes
stand
still
in
their
accustomed
places
,
as
if
the
world
were
stationary
too
,
and
nothing
in
it
ever
perished
in
obedience
to
the
universal
law
,
that
,
while
it
keeps
it
on
the
roll
,
calls
everything
to
earth
.
  
<EOS>
And
here
is
Doctor
Blimber
,
with
his
learned
legs
;
and
here
is
Mrs
Blimber
,
with
her
sky
-
blue
cap
;
and
here
is
Cornelia
,
with
her
sandy
little
row
of
curls
,
and
her
bright
spectacles
,
still
working
like
a
sexton
in
the
graves
of
languages
.
<EOS>
Here
is
the
table
upon
which
he
sat
forlorn
and
strange
,
the
"
new
boy
"
of
the
school
;
and
hither
comes
the
distant
cooing
of
the
old
boys
,
at
their
old
lives
in
the
old
room
on
the
old
principle
!
  
<EOS>
"
Toots
,
"
says
Doctor
Blimber
,
"
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
,
Toots
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
chuckles
in
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Also
to
see
you
,
Toots
,
in
such
good
company
,
"
says
Doctor
Blimber
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
with
a
scarlet
visage
,
explains
that
he
has
met
Miss
Dombey
by
accident
,
and
that
Miss
Dombey
wishing
,
like
himself
,
to
see
the
old
place
,
they
have
come
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
like
,
"
says
Doctor
Blimber
,
"
to
step
among
our
young
friends
,
Miss
Dombey
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
All
fellow
-
students
of
yours
,
Toots
,
once
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
have
no
new
disciples
in
our
little
portico
,
my
dear
,
"
says
Doctor
Blimber
to
Cornelia
,
"
since
Mr
Toots
left
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Except
Bitherstone
,
"
returns
Cornelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
truly
,
"
says
the
Doctor
.
<EOS>
"
Bitherstone
is
new
to
Mr
Toots
.
"
  
<EOS>
New
to
Florence
,
too
,
almost
;
for
,
in
the
schoolroom
,
Bitherstone
---
no
longer
Master
Bitherstone
of
Mrs
Pipchin
's
---
shows
in
collars
and
a
neckcloth
,
and
wears
a
watch
.
<EOS>
But
Bitherstone
,
born
beneath
some
Bengal
star
of
ill
-
omen
,
is
extremely
inky
;
and
his
Lexicon
has
got
so
dropsical
from
constant
reference
,
that
it
wo
n't
shut
,
and
yawns
as
if
it
really
could
not
bear
to
be
so
bothered
.
<EOS>
So
does
Bitherstone
its
master
,
forced
at
Doctor
Blimber
's
highest
pressure
;
but
in
the
yawn
of
Bitherstone
there
is
malice
and
snarl
,
and
he
has
been
heard
to
say
that
he
wishes
he
could
catch
"
old
Blimber
"
in
India
.
<EOS>
He
'd
precious
soon
find
himself
carried
up
the
country
by
a
few
of
his
(
Bitherstone
's
)
Coolies
,
and
handed
over
to
the
Thugs
;
he
can
tell
him
that
.
  
<EOS>
Briggs
is
still
grinding
in
the
mill
of
knowledge
;
and
Tozer
,
too
;
and
Johnson
,
too
;
and
all
the
rest
;
the
older
pupils
being
principally
engaged
in
forgetting
,
with
prodigious
labour
,
everything
they
knew
when
they
were
younger
.
<EOS>
All
are
as
polite
and
as
pale
as
ever
;
and
among
them
,
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
,
with
his
bony
hand
and
bristly
head
,
is
still
hard
at
it
:
with
his
Herodotus
stop
on
just
at
present
,
and
his
other
barrels
on
a
shelf
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
A
mighty
sensation
is
created
,
even
among
these
grave
young
gentlemen
,
by
a
visit
from
the
emancipated
Toots
;
who
is
regarded
with
a
kind
of
awe
,
as
one
who
has
passed
the
Rubicon
,
and
is
pledged
never
to
come
back
,
and
concerning
the
cut
of
whose
clothes
,
and
fashion
of
whose
jewellery
,
whispers
go
about
,
behind
hands
;
the
bilious
Bitherstone
,
who
is
not
of
Mr
Toots
's
time
,
affecting
to
despise
the
latter
to
the
smaller
boys
,
and
saying
he
knows
better
,
and
that
he
should
like
to
see
him
coming
that
sort
of
thing
in
Bengal
,
where
his
mother
has
got
an
emerald
belonging
to
him
that
was
taken
out
of
the
footstool
of
a
Rajah
.
<EOS>
Come
now
!
  
<EOS>
Bewildering
emotions
are
awakened
also
by
the
sight
of
Florence
,
with
whom
every
young
gentleman
immediately
falls
in
love
,
again
:
except
,
as
aforesaid
,
the
bilious
Bitherstone
,
who
declines
to
do
so
,
out
of
contradiction
.
<EOS>
Black
jealousies
of
Mr
Toots
arise
,
and
Briggs
is
of
opinion
that
he
an't
so
very
old
after
all
.
<EOS>
But
this
disparaging
insinuation
is
speedily
made
nought
by
Mr
Toots
saying
aloud
to
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
,
"
How
are
you
,
Feeder
?
"
and
asking
him
to
come
and
dine
with
him
to
-
day
at
the
Bedford
;
in
right
of
which
feats
he
might
set
up
as
Old
Parr
,
if
he
chose
,
unquestioned
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
much
shaking
of
hands
,
and
much
bowing
,
and
a
great
desire
on
the
part
of
each
young
gentleman
to
take
Toots
down
in
Miss
Dombey
's
good
graces
;
and
then
,
Mr
Toots
having
bestowed
a
chuckle
on
his
old
desk
,
Florence
and
he
<EOS>
withdraw
with
Mrs
Blimber
and
Cornelia
;
and
Doctor
Blimber
is
heard
to
observe
behind
them
as
he
comes
out
last
,
and
shuts
the
door
,
"
Gentlemen
,
we
will
now
resume
our
studies
.
<EOS>
"
For
that
and
little
else
is
what
the
Doctor
hears
the
sea
say
,
or
has
heard
it
saying
all
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
then
steals
away
and
goes
upstairs
to
the
old
bedroom
with
Mrs
Blimber
and
Cornelia
;
Mr
Toots
,
who
feels
that
neither
he
nor
anybody
else
is
wanted
there
,
stands
talking
to
the
Doctor
at
the
study
-
door
,
or
rather
hearing
the
Doctor
talk
to
him
,
and
wondering
how
he
ever
thought
the
study
a
great
sanctuary
,
and
the
Doctor
,
with
his
round
turned
legs
,
like
a
clerical
pianoforte
,
an
awful
man
.
<EOS>
Florence
soon
comes
down
and
takes
leave
;
Mr
Toots
takes
leave
;
and
Diogenes
,
who
has
been
worrying
the
weak
-
eyed
young
man
pitilessly
all
the
time
,
shoots
out
at
the
door
,
and
barks
a
glad
defiance
down
the
cliff
;
while
'
Melia
,
and
another
of
the
Doctor
's
female
domestics
,
look
out
of
an
upper
window
,
laughing
"
at
that
there
Toots
,
"
and
saying
of
Miss
Dombey
,
"
<EOS>
But
really
though
,
now
---
ai
n't
she
like
her
brother
<EOS>
,
only
prettier
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
who
saw
when
Florence
came
down
that
there
were
tears
upon
her
face
,
is
desperately
anxious
and
uneasy
,
and
at
first
fears
that
he
did
wrong
in
proposing
the
visit
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
soon
relieved
by
her
saying
she
is
very
glad
to
have
been
there
again
,
and
by
her
talking
quite
cheerfully
about
it
all
,
as
they
walked
on
by
the
sea
.
<EOS>
What
with
the
voices
there
,
and
her
sweet
voice
,
when
they
come
near
Mr
Dombey
's
house
,
and
Mr
Toots
must
leave
her
,
he
is
so
enslaved
that
he
has
not
a
scarp
of
free
-
will
left
;
when
she
gives
him
her
hand
at
parting
,
he
can
not
let
it
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dombey
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
says
Mr
Toots
,
in
a
sad
fluster
,
"
but
if
you
would
allow
me
to
---
to

"
  
The
smiling
and
unconscious
look
of
Florence
brings
him
to
a
dead
stop
.
  
<EOS>
"
If

says
Mr

<EOS>
Florence
looks
at
him
inquiringly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dombey

"
says
Mr
Toots
,
who
feels
that
he
is
in

it
now

"
I

Oh

cries
Florence

for

moment
quite
alarmed

distressed

"
Oh

Stop

Mr
Toots
is
dreadfully
abashed

and
his
mouth
opens
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
so
good

<EOS>
and
here
the
ingenuous
face
smiles
upon
him
with
the
pleasantest
look
of
honesty
in
the
world

Poor
Mr
Toots
goes
home
to
his
Hotel
in
a
state
of
desperation
,
locks
himself
into
his
bedroom
,
flings
himself
upon
his
bed

and
lies
there
for
a
long
time
;
as
if
it
were
of
the
greatest
consequence

nevertheless

<EOS>
But
Mr
Feeder
,
BA

is
coming

dinner

which
happens
well

Mr
Toots
,
or
there
is
no
knowing

he
might
get
up
again

<EOS>
Mr
Toots
is
obliged
to
get
up

hospitable
entertainment

and
good
cheer
)
,
opens
Mr
Toots
's
heart
,
and
warms
him
to
conversation
.
<EOS>
He
does
not
tell
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
,
what
passed
at
the
corner
of
the
Square
;
but
when
Mr
Feeder
asks
him
"
When
it
is
to
come
off
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
replies
,
"
that
there
are
certain
subjects
"
---
which
brings
Mr
Feeder
down
a
peg
or
two
immediately
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
adds
,
that
he
do
n't
know
what
right
Blimber
had
to
notice
his
being
in
Miss
Dombey
's
company
,
and
that
if
he
thought
he
meant
impudence
by
it
,
he
'd
have
him
out
,
Doctor
or
no
Doctor
;
but
he
supposes
it
's
only
his
ignorance
.
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
says
he
has
no
doubt
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
,
however
,
as
an
intimate
friend
,
is
not
excluded
from
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
merely
requires
that
it
should
be
mentioned
mysteriously
,
and
with
feeling
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
glasses
of
wine
,
he
gives
Miss
Dombey
's
health
,
observing
,
"
Feeder
,
you
have
no
idea
of
the
sentiments
with
which
I
propose
that
toast
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
replies
,
"
Oh
,
yes
,
I
have
,
my
dear
Toots
;
and
greatly
they
redound
to
your
honour
,
old
boy
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
is
then
agitated
by
friendship
,
and
shakes
hands
;
and
says
,
if
ever
Toots
wants
a
brother
,
he
knows
where
to
find
him
,
either
by
post
or
parcel
.
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
likewise
says
,
that
if
he
may
advise
,
he
would
recommend
Mr
Toots
to
learn
the
guitar
,
or
,
at
least
the
flute
;
for
women
like
music
,
when
you
are
paying
your
addresses
to
'em
,
and
he
has
found
the
advantage
of
it
himself
.
  
<EOS>
This
brings
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
,
to
the
confession
that
he
has
his
eye
upon
Cornelia
Blimber
.
<EOS>
He
informs
Mr
Toots
that
he
do
n't
object
to
spectacles
,
and
that
if
the
Doctor
were
to
do
the
handsome
thing
and
give
up
the
business
,
why
,
there
they
are
---
provided
for
.
<EOS>
He
says
it
's
his
opinion
that
when
a
man
has
made
a
handsome
sum
by
his
business
,
he
is
bound
to
give
it
up
;
and
that
Cornelia
would
be
an
assistance
in
it
which
any
man
might
be
proud
of
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
replies
by
launching
wildly
out
into
Miss
Dombey
's
praises
,
and
by
insinuations
that
sometimes
he
thinks
he
should
like
to
blow
his
brains
out
.
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
strongly
urges
that
it
would
be
a
rash
attempt
,
and
shows
him
,
as
a
reconcilement
to
existence
,
Cornelia
's
portrait
,
spectacles
and
all
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
these
quiet
spirits
pass
the
evening
;
and
when
it
has
yielded
place
to
night
,
Mr
Toots
walks
home
with
Mr
Feeder
,
and
parts
with
him
at
Doctor
Blimber
's
door
.
<EOS>
But
Mr
Feeder
only
goes
up
the
steps
,
and
when
Mr
Toots
is
gone
,
comes
down
again
,
to
stroll
upon
the
beach
alone
,
and
think
about
his
prospects
.
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
plainly
hears
the
waves
informing
him
,
as
he
loiters
along
,
that
Doctor
Blimber
will
give
up
the
business
;
and
he
feels
a
soft
romantic
pleasure
in
looking
at
the
outside
of
the
house
,
and
thinking
that
the
Doctor
will
first
paint
it
,
and
put
it
into
thorough
repair
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
is
likewise
roaming
up
and
down
,
outside
the
casket
that
contains
his
jewel
;
and
in
a
deplorable
condition
of
mind
,
and
not
unsuspected
by
the
police
,
gazes
at
a
window
where
he
sees
a
light
,
and
which
he
has
no
doubt
<EOS>
is
Florence
's
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
,
for
that
is
Mrs
Skewton
's
room
;
and
<EOS>
while
Florence
,
sleeping
in
another
chamber
,
dreams
lovingly
,
in
the
midst
of
the
old
scenes
,
and
their
old
associations
live
again
,
the
figure
which
in
grim
reality
is
substituted
for
the
patient
boy
's
on
the
same
theatre
,
once
more
to
connect
it
---
but
how
differently
!
---
with
decay
and
death
,
is
stretched
there
,
wakeful
and
complaining
.
<EOS>
Ugly
and
haggard
it
lies
upon
its
bed
of
unrest
;
and
by
it
,
in
the
terror
of
her
unimpassioned
loveliness
---
for
it
has
terror
in
the
sufferer
's
failing
eyes
---
sits
Edith
.
<EOS>
What
do
the
waves
say
,
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
,
to
them
?
  
<EOS>
"
Edith
,
what
is
that
stone
arm
raised
to
strike
me
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
,
mother
,
but
your
fancy
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
my
fancy
!
<EOS>
Everything
is
my
fancy
.
<EOS>
Look
!
<EOS>
Is
it
possible
that
you
do
n't
see
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
mother
,
there
is
nothing
.
<EOS>
Should
I
sit
unmoved
,
if
there
were
any
such
thing
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Unmoved
?
"
<EOS>
looking
wildly
at
her
---
"
it
's
gone
now
---
and
why
are
you
so
unmoved
?
<EOS>
That
is
not
my
fancy
,
Edith
.
<EOS>
It
turns
me
cold
to
see
you
sitting
at
my
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
,
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sorry
!
<EOS>
You
seem
always
sorry
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
for
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
she
cries
;
and
tossing
her
restless
head
from
side
to
side
upon
her
pillow
,
runs
on
about
neglect
,
and
the
mother
she
has
been
,
and
the
mother
<EOS>
the
good
old
creature
was
,
whom
they
met
,
and
the
cold
return
the
daughters
of
such
mothers
make
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
her
incoherence
,
she
stops
,
looks
at
her
daughter
,
cries
out
that
her
wits
are
going
,
and
hides
her
face
upon
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Edith
,
in
compassion
,
bends
over
her
and
speaks
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
sick
old
woman
clutches
her
round
the
neck
,
and
says
,
with
a
look
of
horror
,
  
<EOS>
"
Edith
!
<EOS>
we
are
going
home
soon
;
going
back
.
<EOS>
You
mean
that
I
shall
go
home
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
mother
,
yes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
he
said
---
what's
-
his
-
name
,
I
never
could
remember
names
---
Major
---
that
dreadful
word
,
when
we
came
away
---
it
's
not
true
?
<EOS>
Edith
!
"
<EOS>
with
a
shriek
and
a
stare
,
"
it
's
not
that
that
is
the
matter
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Night
after
night
,
the
lights
burn
in
the
window
,
and
the
figure
lies
upon
the
bed
,
and
Edith
sits
beside
it
,
and
the
restless
waves
are
calling
to
them
both
the
whole
night
long
.
<EOS>
Night
after
night
,
the
waves
are
hoarse
with
repetition
of
their
mystery
;
the
dust
lies
piled
upon
the
shore
;
the
sea
-
birds
soar
and
hover
;
the
winds
and
clouds
are
on
their
trackless
flight
;
the
white
arms
beckon
,
in
the
moonlight
,
to
the
invisible
country
far
away
.
  
<EOS>
And
still
the
sick
old
woman
looks
into
the
corner
,
where
the
stone
arm
---
part
of
a
figure
of
some
tomb
,
she
says
---
is
raised
to
strike
her
.
<EOS>
At
last
it
falls
;
and
then
a
dumb
old
woman
lies
upon
the
bed
,
and
she
is
crooked
and
shrunk
up
,
and
half
of
her
is
dead
.
  
<EOS>
Such
is
the
figure
,
painted
and
patched
for
the
sun
to
mock
,
that
is
drawn
slowly
through
the
crowd
from
day
to
day
;
looking
,
as
it
goes
,
for
the
good
old
creature
who
was
such
a
mother
,
and
making
mouths
as
it
peers
among
the
crowd
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Such
is
the
figure
that
is
often
wheeled
down
to
the
margin
of
the
sea
,
and
stationed
there
;
but
on
which
no
wind
can
blow
freshness
,
and
for
which
the
murmur
of
the
ocean
has
no
soothing
word
.
<EOS>
She
lies
and
listens
to
it
by
the
hour
;
but
its
speech
is
dark
and
gloomy
to
her
,
and
a
dread
is
on
her
face
,
and
when
her
eyes
wander
over
the
expanse
,
they
see
but
a
broad
stretch
of
desolation
between
earth
and
heaven
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
she
seldom
sees
,
and
when
she
does
,
is
angry
with
and
mows
at
.
<EOS>
Edith
is
beside
her
always
,
and
keeps
Florence
away
;
and
Florence
,
in
her
bed
at
night
,
trembles
at
the
thought
of
death
in
such
a
shape
,
and
often
wakes
and
listens
,
thinking
it
has
come
.
<EOS>
No
one
attends
on
her
<EOS>
but
Edith
.
<EOS>
It
is
better
that
few
eyes
should
see
her
;
and
her
daughter
watches
alone
by
the
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
A
shadow
even
on
that
shadowed
face
,
a
sharpening
even
of
the
sharpened
features
,
and
a
thickening
of
the
veil
before
the
eyes
into
a
pall
that
shuts
out
the
dim
world
,
is
come
.
<EOS>
Her
wandering
hands
upon
the
coverlet
join
feebly
palm
to
palm
,
and
move
towards
her
daughter
;
and
a
voice
not
like
hers
,
not
like
any
voice
that
speaks
our
mortal
language
---
says
,
"
For
I
nursed
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
,
without
a
tear
,
kneels
down
to
bring
her
voice
closer
to
the
sinking
head
,
and
answers
:
  
"
<EOS>
Mother
,
can
you
hear
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Staring
wide
,
she
tries
to
nod
in
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
recollect
the
night
before
I
married
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
head
is
motionless
,
but
it
expresses
somehow
that
she
does
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
then
I
forgave
your
part
in
it
,
and
prayed
God
to
forgive
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
that
the
past
was
at
an
end
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
say
so
now
,
again
.
<EOS>
Kiss
me
,
mother
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
touches
the
white
lips
,
and
for
a
moment
all
is
still
.
<EOS>
A
moment
afterwards
,
her
mother
,
with
her
girlish
laugh
,
and
the
skeleton
of
the
Cleopatra
manner
,
rises
in
her
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Draw
the
rose
-
coloured
curtains
.
<EOS>
There
is
something
else
upon
its
flight
besides
the
wind
and
clouds
.
<EOS>
Draw
the
rosecoloured
curtains
close
!
  
<EOS>
Intelligence
of
the
event
is
sent
to
Mr
Dombey
in
town
,
who
waits
upon
Cousin
Feenix
(
not
yet
able
to
make
up
his
mind
for
Baden
-
Baden
)
,
who
has
just
received
it
too
.
<EOS>
A
goodnatured
creature
like
Cousin
Feenix
is
the
very
man
for
a
marriage
or
a
funeral
,
and
his
position
in
the
family
renders
it
right
that
he
should
be
consulted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dombey
,
"
said
Cousin
Feenix
,
"
upon
my
soul
,
I
am
very
much
shocked
to
see
you
on
such
a
melancholy
occasion
.
<EOS>
My
poor
aunt
!
<EOS>
She
was
a
devilish
lively
woman
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
replies
,
"
Very
much
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
made
up
,
"
says
Cousin
Feenix
,
"
really
young
,
you
know
,
considering
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
on
the
day
of
your
marriage
,
I
thought
she
was
good
for
another
twenty
years
.
<EOS>
In
point
of
fact
,
I
said
so
to
a
man
at
Brook
's
---
<EOS>
little
Billy
Joper
---
you
know
him
,
no
doubt
---
man
with
a
glass
in
his
eye
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
bows
a
negative
.
"
<EOS>
In
reference
to
the
obsequies
,
"
he
hints
,
"
whether
there
is
any
suggestion
"
  
"
Well
,
upon
my
life
,
"
says
Cousin
Feenix
,
stroking
his
chin
,
which
he
has
just
enough
of
hand
below
his
wristbands
to
do
;
"
I
really
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
Mausoleum
down
at
my
place
,
in
the
park
,
but
I
'm
afraid
it
's
in
bad
repair
,
and
,
in
point
of
fact
,
in
a
devil
of
a
state
.
<EOS>
But
for
being
a
little
out
at
elbows
,
I
should
have
had
it
put
to
rights
;
but
I
believe
the
people
come
and
make
pic
-
nic
parties
there
inside
the
iron
railings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
is
clear
that
this
wo
n't
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
an
uncommon
good
church
in
the
village
,
"
says
Cousin
Feenix
,
thoughtfully
;
"
pure
specimen
of
the
AngloNorman
style
,
and
admirably
well
sketched
too
by
Lady
Jane
Finchbury
---
woman
with
tight
stays
---
<EOS>
but
they
've
spoilt
it
with
whitewash
,
I
understand
,
and
it
's
a
long
journey
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
Brighton
itself
,
"
Mr
Dombey
suggests
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
honour
,
Dombey
,
I
do
n't
think
we
could
do
better
,
"
says
Cousin
Feenix
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
on
the
spot
,
you
see
,
and
a
very
cheerful
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
when
,
"
hints
Mr
Dombey
,
"
would
it
be
convenient
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
make
a
point
,
"
says
Cousin
Feenix
,
"
of
pledging
myself
for
any
day
you
think
best
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
great
pleasure
(
melancholy
pleasure
,
of
course
)
in
following
my
poor
aunt
to
the
confines
of
the
in
point
of
fact
,
to
the
grave
,
"
says
Cousin
Feenix
,
failing
in
the
other
turn
of
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
Monday
do
for
leaving
town
?
"
says
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Monday
would
suit
me
to
perfection
,
"
replies
Cousin
Feenix
.
<EOS>
Therefore
Mr
Dombey
arranges
to
take
Cousin
Feenix
down
on
that
day
,
and
presently
takes
his
leave
,
attended
to
the
stairs
by
Cousin
Feenix
,
who
says
,
at
parting
,
<EOS>
"
I
'm
really
excessively
sorry
,
Dombey
,
that
you
should
have
so
much
trouble
about
it
;
"
to
which
Mr
Dombey
answers
,
"
Not
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
the
appointed
time
,
Cousin
Feenix
and
Mr
Dombey
meet
,
and
go
down
to
Brighton
,
and
representing
,
in
their
two
selves
,
all
the
other
mourners
for
the
deceased
lady
's

Cousin

sitting
in

recognises
innumerable

on

takes
no

notice

in

checking

At
the
ceremony
Cousin
Feenix
is
depressed
,
observing
,
that
these
are
the
occasions
to
make
a
man
think
,
in
point
of
fact
,
that
he
is
getting
shaky
;
and
his
eyes
are
really
moistened
,
when
it
is
over
.
<EOS>
But
he
soon
recovers
;
and
so
do
the
rest
of
Mrs
Skewton
's
relatives
and
friends
,
of
whom
the
Major
continually
tells
the
club
that
she
never
did
wrap
up
enough
;
while
the
young
lady
with
the
back
,
who
has
so
much
trouble
with
her
eyelids
,
says
,
with
a
little
scream
,
that
she
must
have
been
enormously
old
,
and
that
she
died
of
all
kinds
of
horrors
,
and
you
must
n't
mention
it
.
  
<EOS>
So
Edith
's
mother
lies
unmentioned
of
her
dear
friends
,
who
are
deaf
to
the
waves
that
are
hoarse
with
repetition
of
their
mystery
,
and
blind
to
the
dust
that
is
piled
upon
the
shore
,
and
to
the
white
arms
that
are
beckoning
,
in
the
moonlight
,
to
the
invisible
country
far
away

<EOS>
But
all
goes
on
,
as
it
was
wo
nt
,
upon
the
margin
of
the
unknown
sea
;
and
edith
standing
there
alone
,
and
listening
to
its
waves
,
has
dank
weed
cast
up

feet

sou'wester

dressed
in
a
substantial
suit
of

which
,
while
it
affected
to
be
a

sober
and
demure
livery
indeed
,
was
really
as

-
satisfied
and
confident
a
one
as

need
desire
to
make
,
Rob
the
Grinder
,
thus
transformed
as
to
his
outer
man
,
and
all
regardless
within
of
the
Captain
and
the
Midshipman
,
except
when
he
devoted
a
few
minutes
of
his
leisure
time
to
crowing
over
those
inseparable
worthies
,
and
recalling
,
with
much
applauding
music
from
that
brazen
instrument
,
his
conscience
,
the
triumphant
manner
in
which
he
had
disembarrassed
himself
of
their
company
,
now
served
his
patron
,
Mr
Carker
.
<EOS>
Inmate
of
Mr
Carker
's
house
,
and
serving
about
his
person
<EOS>
,
Rob
kept
his
round
eyes
on
the
white
teeth
with
fear
and
trembling
,
and
felt
that
he
had
need
to
open
them
wider
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
quaked
more
,
through
his
whole
being
,
before
the
teeth
,
though
he
had
come
into
the
service
of
some
powerful
enchanter
,
and
they
had
been
his
strongest
spell
.
<EOS>
The
boy
had
a
sense
of
power
and
authority
in
this
patron
of
his
that
engrossed
his
whole
attention
and
exacted
his
most
implicit
submission
and
obedience
.
<EOS>
He
hardly
considered
himself
safe
in
thinking
about
him
when
he
was
absent
,
lest
he
should
feel
himself
immediately
taken
by
the
throat
again
,
as
on
the
morning
when
he
first
became
bound
to
him
,
and
should
see
every
one
of
the
teeth
finding
him
out
,
and
taking
him
with
every
fancy
of
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Face
to
face
with
him
,
Rob
had
no
more
doubt
that
Mr
Carker
read
his
secret
thoughts
,
or
that
he
could
read
them
by
the
least
exertion
of
his
will
if
he
were
so
inclined
,
than
he
had
that
Mr
Carker
saw
him
when
he
looked
at
him
.
<EOS>
The
ascendancy
was
so
complete
,
and
held
him
in
such
enthralment
,
that
,
hardly
daring
to
think
at
all
,
but
with
his
mind
filled
with
a
constantly
dilating
impression
of
his
patron
's
irresistible
command
over
him
,
and
power
of
doing
anything
with
him
,
he
would
stand
watching
his
pleasure
,
and
trying
to
anticipate
his
orders
,
in
a
state
of
mental
suspension
,
as
to
all
other
things
.
  
<EOS>
Rob
had
not
informed
himself
perhaps
---
in
his
then
state
of
mind
it
would
have
been
an
act
of
no
common
temerity
to
inquire
---
whether
he
yielded
so
completely
to
this
influence
in
any
part
,
because
he
had
floating
suspicions
of
his
patron
's
being
a
master
of
certain
treacherous
arts
in
which
he
had
himself
been
a
poor
scholar
at
the
Grinders
'
School
.
<EOS>
But
certainly
Rob
admired
him
,
as
well
as
feared
him
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
,
perhaps
,
was
better
acquainted
with
the
sources
of
his
power
,
which
lost
nothing
by
his
management
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
very
night
when
he
left
the
Captain
's
service
,
Rob
,
after
disposing
of
his
pigeons
,
and
even
making
a
bad
bargain
in
his
hurry
,
had
gone
straight
down
to
Mr
Carker
's
house
,
and
hotly
presented
himself
before
his
new
master
with
a
glowing
face
that
seemed
to
expect
commendation
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
scapegrace
!
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
glancing
at
his
bundle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
left
your
situation
and
come
to
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
if
you
please
,
Sir
,
"
faltered
Rob
,
"
you
said
,
you
know
,
when
I
come
here
last
---
"
  
"
I
said
,
"
returned
Mr
Carker
,
"
what
did
I
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
If
you
please
,
Sir
,
you
did
n't
say
nothing
at
all
,
Sir
,
"
returned
Rob
,
warned
by
the
manner
of
this
inquiry
,
and
very
much
disconcerted
.
  
<EOS>
His
patron
looked
at
him
with
a
wide
display
of
gums
,
and
shaking
his
forefinger
,
observed
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
come
to
an
evil
end
,
my
vagabond
friend
,
I
foresee
.
<EOS>
There
's
ruin
in
store
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
if
you
please
,
do
n't
,
Sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rob
,
with
his
legs
trembling
under
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
,
Sir
,
I
only
want
to
work
for
you
,
Sir
,
and
to
wait
upon
you
,
Sir
,
and
to
do
faithful
whatever
I
'm
bid
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
do
faithfully
whatever
you
are
bid
,
"
returned
his
patron
,
"
if
you
have
anything
to
do
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
know
that
,
Sir
,
"
pleaded
the
submissive
Rob
;
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
of
that
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
If
you
'll
only
be
so
good
as
try
me
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
And
if
ever
you
find
me
out
,
Sir
,
doing
anything
against
your
wishes
,
I
give
you
leave
to
kill
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
dog
!
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
and
smiling
at
him
serenely
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
nothing
to
what
I
'd
do
to
you
if
you
tried
to
deceive
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
abject
Grinder
,
"
I
'm
sure
you
would
be
down
upon
me
dreadful
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
attempt
for
to
go
and
do
it
,
Sir
,
not
if
I
was
bribed
with
golden
guineas
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Thoroughly
checked
in
his
expectations
of
commendation
,
the
crestfallen
Grinder
stood
looking
at
his
patron
,
and
vainly
endeavouring
not
to
look
at
him
,
with
the
uneasiness
which
a
cur
will
often
manifest
in
a
similar
situation
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
have
left
your
old
service
,
and
come
here
to
ask
me
to
take
you
into
mine
,
eh
?
"
said
Mr
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
if
you
please
,
Sir
,
"
returned
Rob
,
who
,
in
doing
so
,
had
acted
on
his
patron
's
own
instructions
,
but
dared
not
justify
himself
by
the
least
insinuation
to
that
effect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
"
You
know
me
,
boy
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Please
,
Sir
,
yes
,
Sir
,
"
returned
Rob
,
fumbling
with
his
hat
,
and
still
fixed
by
Mr
Carker
's
eye
,
and
fruitlessly
endeavouring
to
unfix
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
nodded
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Take
care
,
then
!
"
  
<EOS>
Rob
expressed
in
a
number
of
short
bows
his
lively
understanding
of
this
caution
,
and
was
bowing
himself
back
to
the
door
,
greatly
relieved
by
the
prospect
of
getting
on
the
outside
of
it
,
when
his
patron
stopped
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
calling
him
roughly
back
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
---
shut
that
door
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rob
obeyed
as
if
his
life
had
depended
on
his
alacrity
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
used
to
eaves
-
dropping
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
what
that
means
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Listening
,
Sir
?
"
Rob
hazarded
,
after
some
embarrassed
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
His
patron
nodded
.
"
<EOS>
And
watching
,
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
do
such
a
thing
here
,
Sir
,
"
answered
Rob
;
"
upon
my
word
and
honour
,
I
would
n't
,
Sir
,
I
wish
I
may
die
if
I
would
,
Sir
,
for
anything
that
could
be
promised
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
should
consider
it
is
as
much
as
all
the
world
was
worth
,
to
offer
to
do
such
a
thing
,
unless
I
was
ordered
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
not
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
used
,
too
,
to
babbling
and
tattling
,
"
said
his
patron
with
perfect
coolness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Beware
of
that
here
,
or
you
're
a
lost
rascal
,
"
and
he
smiled
again
,
and
again
cautioned
him
with
his
forefinger
.
  
<EOS>
The
Grinder
's
breath
came
short
and
thick
with
consternation
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
protest
the
purity
of
his
intentions
,
but
could
only
stare
at
the
smiling
gentleman
in
a
stupor
of
submission
,
with
which
the
smiling
gentleman
seemed
well
enough
satisfied
,
for
he
ordered
him
down
stairs
,
after
observing
him
for
some
moments
in
silence
,
and
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
was
retained
in
his
employment
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
manner
of
Rob
the
Grinder
's
engagement
by
Mr
Carker
,
and
his
awe
-
stricken
devotion
to
that
gentleman
had
strengthened
and
increased
,
if
possible
,
with
every
minute
of
his
service
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
service
of
some
months
'
duration
,
when
early
one
morning
,
Rob
opened
the
garden
gate
to
Mr
Dombey
,
who
was
come
to
breakfast
with
his
master
,
by
appointment
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
his
master
himself
came
,
hurrying
forth
to
receive
the
distinguished
guest
,
and
give
him
welcome
with
all
his
teeth
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
thought
,
"
said
Carker
,
when
he
had
assisted
him
to
alight
from
his
horse
,
"
to
see
you
here
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
This
is
an
extraordinary
day
in
my
calendar
.
<EOS>
No
occasion
is
very
special
to
a
man
like
you
,
who
may
do
anything
;
but
to
a
man
like
me
,
the
case
is
widely
different
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
tasteful
place
here
,
Carker
's
said
Mr
Dombey
,
condescending
to
stop
upon
the
lawn
,
to
look
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
afford
to
say
so
,
"
returned
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
in
his
lofty
patronage
,
"
any
one
might
say
so
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
it
goes
,
it
is
a
very
commodious
and
well
-
arranged
place
---
quite
elegant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
it
goes
,
truly
,
"
returned
Carker
,
with
an
air
of
disparagement
.
<EOS>
"
It
wants
that
qualification
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
we
have
said
enough
about
it
;
and
though
you
can
afford
to
praise
it
,
I
thank
you
none
the
less
.
<EOS>
Will
you
walk
in
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
entering
the
house
,
noticed
,
as
he
had
reason
to
do
,
the
complete
arrangement
of
the
rooms
,
and
the
numerous
contrivances
for
comfort
and
effect
that
abounded
there
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
,
in
his
ostentation
of
humility
,
received
this
notice
with
a
deferential
smile
,
and
said
he
understood
its
delicate
meaning
,
and
appreciated
it
,
but
in
truth
the
cottage
was
good
enough
for
one
in
his
position
---
better
,
perhaps
,
than
such
a
man
should
occupy
,
poor
as
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
perhaps
to
you
,
who
are
so
far
removed
,
it
really
does
look
better
than
it
is
,
"
he
said
,
with
his
false
mouth
distended
to
its
fullest
stretch
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
as
monarchs
imagine
attractions
in
the
lives
of
beggars
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
directed
a
sharp
glance
and
a
sharp
smile
at
Mr
Dombey
as
he
spoke
,
and
a
sharper
glance
,
and
a
sharper
smile
yet
,
when
Mr
Dombey
,
drawing
himself
up
before
the
fire
,
in
the
attitude
so
often
copied
by
his
second
in
command
,
looked
round
at
the
pictures
on
thewalls
.
<EOS>
Cursorily
as
his
cold
eye
wandered
over
them
,
Carker
's
keen
glance
accompanied
his
,
and
kept
pace
with
his
,
marking
exactly
where
it
went
,
and
what
it
saw
.
<EOS>
As
it
rested
on
one
picture
in
particular
,
Carker
hardly
seemed
to
breathe
,
his
sidelong
scrutiny
was
so
catlike
and
vigilant
,
but
the
eye
of
his
great
chief
passed
from
that
,
as
from
the
others
,
and
appeared
no
more
impressed
by
it
than
by
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
Carker
looked
at
it
---
it
was
the
picture
that
resembled
Edith
---
as
if
it
were
a
living
thing
;
and
with
a
wicked
,
silent
laugh
upon
his
face
,
that
seemed
in
part
addressed
to
it
,
though
it
was
all
derisive
of
the
great
man
standing
so
unconscious
beside
him
.
<EOS>
Breakfast
was
soon
set
upon
the
table
:
and
,
inviting
Mr
Dombey
to
a
chair
which
had
its
back
towards
this
picture
,
he
took
his
own
seat
opposite
to
it
as
usual
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
was
even
graver
than
it
was
his
custom
to
be
,
and
quite
silent
.
<EOS>
The
parrot
,
swinging
in
the
gilded
hoop
within
her
gaudy
cage
,
attempted
in
vain
to
attract
notice
,
for
Carker
was
too
observant
of
his
visitor
to
heed
her
;
and
the
visitor
,
abstracted
in
meditation
,
looked
fixedly
,
not
to
say
sullenly
,
over
his
stiff
neckcloth
,
without
raising
his
eyes
from
the
table
-
cloth
.
<EOS>
As
to
Rob
,
who
was
in
attendance
,
all
his
faculties
and
energies
were
so
locked
up
in
observation
of
his
master
,
that
he
scarcely
ventured
to
give
shelter
to
the
thought
that
the
visitor
was
the
great
gentleman
before
whom
he
had
been
carried
as
a
certificate
of
the
family
health
,
in
his
childhood
,
and
to
whom
he
had
been
indebted
for
his
leather
smalls
.
  
<EOS>
"
Allow
me
,
"
said
Carker
suddenly
,
"
to
ask
how
Mrs
Dombey
is
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
leaned
forward
obsequiously
,
as
he
made
the
inquiry
,
with
his
chin
resting
on
his
hand
;
and
at
the
same
time
his
eyes
went
up
to
the
picture
,
as
if
he
said
to
it
,
"
Now
,
see
,
how
I
will
lead
him
on
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
reddened
as
he
answered
:
  
"
Mrs
Dombey
is
quite
well
.
<EOS>
You
remind
me
,
Carker
,
of
some
conversation
that
I
wish
to
have
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Robin
,
you
can
leave
us
,
"
said
his
master
,
at
whose
mild
tones
Robin
started
and
disappeared
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
his
patron
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
remember
that
boy
,
of
course
?
"
he
added
,
when
the
immeshed
Grinder
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
with
magnificent
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
likely
that
a
man
like
you
would
.
<EOS>
Hardly
possible
,
"
murmured
Carker
.
"
<EOS>
But
he
is
one
of
that
family
from
whom
you
took
a
nurse
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
may
remember
having
generously
charged
yourself
with
his
education
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
that
boy
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
with
a
frown
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
does
little
credit
to
his
education
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
he
is
a
young
rip
,
I
am
afraid
,
"
returned
Carker
,
with
a
shrug
.
"
<EOS>
He
bears
that
character
.
<EOS>
But
the
truth
is
,
I
took
him
into
my
service
because
,
being
able
to
get
no
other
employment
,
he
conceived
(
had
been
taught
at
home
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
)
that
he
had
some
sort
of
claim
upon
you
,
and
was
constantly
trying
to
dog
your
heels
with
his
petition
.
<EOS>
And
although
my
defined
and
recognised
connexion
with
your
affairs
is
merely
of
a
business
character
,
still
I
have
that
spontaneous
interest
in
everything
belonging
to
you
,
<EOS>
that
---
"
  
He
stopped
again
,
as
if
to
discover
whether
he
had
led
Mr
Dombey
far
enough
yet
.
<EOS>
And
again
,
with
his
chin
resting
on
his
hand
,
he
leered
at
the
picture
.
  
<EOS>
"
Carker
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
I
am
sensible
that
you
do
not
limit
your
---
"
  
"
Service
,
"
suggested
his
smiling
entertainer
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
prefer
to
say
your
regard
,
"
observed
Mr
Dombey
;
very
sensible
,
as
he
said
so
,
that
he
was
paying
him
a
handsome
and
flattering
compliment
,
"
to
our
mere
business
relations
.
<EOS>
Your
consideration
for
my
feelings
,
hopes
and
disappointments
,
in
the
little
instance
you
have
just
now
mentioned
,
is
an
example
in
point
.
<EOS>
I
am
obliged
to
you
,
Carker
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
bent
his
head
slowly
,
and
very
softly
rubbed
his
hands
,
as
if
he
were
afraid
by
any
action
to
disturb
the
current
of
Mr
Dombey
's
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
allusion
to
it
is
opportune
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
after
a
little
hesitation
;
"
for
it
prepares
the
way
to
what
I
was
beginning
to
say
to
you
,
and
reminds
me
that
that
involves
no
absolutely
new
relations
between
us
,
although
it
may
involve
more
personal
confidence
on
my
part
than
I
have
hitherto
---
"
  
"
Distinguished
me
with
,
"
suggested
Carker
,
bending
his
head
again
:
"
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
to
you
how
honoured
I
am
;
for
a
man
like
you
well
knows
how
much
honour
he
has
in
his
power
to
bestow
at
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mrs
Dombey
and
myself
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
passing
this
compliment
with
august
self
-
denial
,
"
are
not
quite
agreed
upon
some
points
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
appear
to
understand
each
other
yet
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Dombey
has
something
to
learn
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mrs
Dombey
is
distinguished
by
many
rare
attractions
;
and
has
been
accustomed
,
no
doubt
,
to
receive
much
adulation
,
"
said
the
smooth
,
sleek
watcher
of
his
slightest
look
and
tone
.
<EOS>
"
But
where
there
is
affection
,
duty
,
and
respect
,
any
little
mistakes
engendered
by
such
causes
are
soon
set
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
thoughts
instinctively
flew
back
to
the
face
that
had
looked
at
him
in
his
wife
's
dressing
-
room
,
when
an
imperious
hand
was
stretched
towards
the
door
;
and
remembering
the
affection
,
duty
,
and
respect
,
expressed
in
it
,
he
felt
the
blood
rush
to
his
own
face
quite
as
plainly
as
the
watchful
eyes
upon
him
saw
it
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Dombey
and
myself
,
"
he
went
on
to
say
,
"
had
some
discussion
,
before
Mrs
Skewton
's
death
,
upon
the
cause
of
my
dissatisfaction
;
of
which
you
will
have
formed
a
general
understanding
from
having
been
a
witness
of
what
passed
between
Mrs
Dombeyand
myself
on
the
evening
when
you
were
at
our
---
at
my
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
so
much
regretted
being
present
,
"
said
the
smiling
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Proud
as
a
man
in
my
position
necessarily
must
be
of
your
familiar
notice
---
though
I
give
you
no
credit
for
it
;
you
may
do
anything
you
please
without
losing
caste
-
and
honoured
as
I
was
by
an
early
presentation
to
Mrs
Dombey
,
before
she
was
made
eminent
by
bearing
your
name
<EOS>
,
I
almost
regretted
that
night
,
I
assure
you
,
that
I
had
been
the
object
of
such
especial
good
fortune
.
"
  
<EOS>
That
any
man
could
,
under
any
possible
circumstances
,
regret
the
being
distinguished
by
his
condescension
and
patronage
,
was
a
moral
phenomenon
which
Mr
Dombey
could
not
comprehend
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
responded
,
with
a
considerable
accession
of
dignity
.
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
And
why
,
Carker
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
,
"
returned
the
confidential
agent
,
"
that
Mrs
Dombey
,
never
very
much
disposed
to
regard
me
with
favourable
interest
---
<EOS>
one
in
my
position
could
not
expect
that
,
from
a
lady
naturally
proud
,
and
whose
pride
becomes
her
so
well
---
may
not
easily
forgive
my
innocent
part
in
that
conversation
.
<EOS>
Your
displeasure
is
no
light
matter
,
you
must
remember
;
and
to
be
visited
with
it
before
a
third
party
---
"
  
"
Carker
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
arrogantly
;
<EOS>
"
I
presume
that
I
am
the
first
consideration
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Can
there
be
a
doubt
about
it
?
<EOS>
"
replied
the
other
,
with
the
impatience
of
a
man
admitting
a
notorious
and
incontrovertible
fact
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Dombey
becomes
a
secondary
consideration
,
when
we
are
both
in
question
,
I
imagine
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
Is
that
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
so
?
"
returned
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
better
than
any
one
,
that
you
have
no
need
to
ask
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
hope
,
Carker
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
that
your
regret
in
the
acquisition
of
Mrs
Dombey
's
displeasure
,
may
be
almost
counterbalanced
by
your
satisfaction
in
retaining
my
confidence
and
good
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
misfortune
<EOS>
,
I
find
,
"
returned
Carker
,
"
to
have
incurred
that
displeasure
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Dombey
has
expressed
it
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Dombey
has
expressed
various
opinions
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
with
majestic
coldness
and
indifference
,
"
in
which
I
do
not
participate
,
and
which
I
am
not
inclined
to
discuss
,
or
to
recall
.
<EOS>
I
made
Mrs
Dombey
acquainted
,
some
time
since
,
as
I
have
already
told
you
,
with
certain
points
of
domestic
deference
and
submission
on
which
I
felt
it
necessary
to
insist
.
<EOS>
I
failed
to
convince
Mrs
Dombey
of
the
expediency
of
her
immediately
altering
her
conduct
in
those
respects
,
with
a
view
to
her
own
peace
and
welfare
,
and
my
dignity
;
and
I
informed
Mrs
Dombey
that
if
I
should
find
it
necessary
to
object
or
remonstrate
again
,
I
should
express
my
opinion
to
her
through
yourself
,
my
confidential
agent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Blended
with
the
look
,
that
Carker
bent
upon
him
,
was
a
devilish
look
at
the
picture
over
his
head
,
that
struck
upon
it
like
a
flash
of
lightning
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Carker
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
I
do
not
hesitate
to
say
to
you
that
I
will
carry
my
point
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
to
be
trifled
with
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Dombey
must
understand
that
my
will
is
law
,
and
that
I
can
not
allow
of
one
exception
to
the
whole
rule
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
the
goodness
to
undertake
this
charge
,
which
,
coming
from
me
,
is
not
unacceptable
to
you
,
<EOS>
I
hope
,
whatever
regret
you
may
politely
profess
---
for
which
I
am
obliged
to
you
on
behalf
of
Mrs
Dombey
;
and
you
will
have
the
goodness
<EOS>
,
I
am
persuaded
,
to
discharge
it
as
exactly
as
any
other
commission
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
"
that
you
have
only
to
command
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
with
a
majestic
indication
of
assent
,
"
that
I
have
only
to
command
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
necessary
that
I
should
proceed
in
this
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Dombey
is
a
lady
undoubtedly
highly
qualified
,
in
many
respects
,
to
---
"
   
"
To
do
credit
even
to
your
choice
,
"
suggested
Carker
,
with
a
fawning
show
of
teeth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
if
you
please
to
adopt
that
form
of
words
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
in
his
tone
of
state
;
"
and
at
present
I
do
not
conceive
that
Mrs
Dombey
does
that
credit
to
it
,
to
which
it
is
entitled
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
principle
of
opposition
in
Mrs
Dombey
that
must
be
eradicated
;
that
must
be
overcome
:
Mrs
Dombey
does
not
appear
to
understand
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
forcibly
,
"
that
the
idea
of
opposition
to
Me
is
monstrous
and
absurd
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
,
in
the
City
,
know
you
better
,
"
replied
Carker
,
with
a
smile
from
ear
to
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
me
better
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
.
<EOS>
Though
,
indeed
,
I
am
bound
to
do
Mrs
Dombey
the
justice
of
saying
,
however
inconsistent
it
may
seem
with
her
subsequent
conduct
(
which
remains
unchanged
)
,
that
on
my
expressing
my
disapprobation
and
determination
to
her
,
with
some
severity
,
on
the
occasion
to
which
I
have
referred
,
my
admonition
appeared
to
produce
a
very
powerful
effect
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
delivered
himself
of
those
words
with
most
portentous
stateliness
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
to
have
the
goodness
,
then
,
to
inform
Mrs
Dombey
,
Carker
,
from
me
,
that
I
must
recall
our
former
conversation
to
her
remembrance
,
in
some
surprise
that
it
has
not
yet
had
its
effect
.
<EOS>
That
I
must
insist
upon
her
regulating
her
conduct
by
the
injunctions
laid
upon
her
in
that
conversation
.
<EOS>
That
I
am
not
satisfied
with
her
conduct
.
<EOS>
That
I
am
greatly
dissatisfied
with
it
.
<EOS>
And
that
I
shall
be
under
the
very
disagreeable
necessity
of
making
you
the
bearer
of
yet
more
unwelcome
and
explicit
communications
,
if
she
has
not
the
good
sense
and
the
proper
feeling
to
adapt
herself
to
my
wishes
,
as
the
first
Mrs
Dombey
did
,
and
,
<EOS>
I
believe
I
may
add
,
as
any
other
lady
in
her
place
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
first
Mrs
Dombey
lived
very
happily
,
"
said
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
first
Mrs
Dombey
had
great
good
sense
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
in
a
gentlemanly
toleration
of
the
dead
,
"
and
very
correct
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Miss
Dombey
like
her
mother
,
do
you
think
?
"
said
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
Swiftly
and
darkly
,
Mr
Dombey
's
face
changed
.
<EOS>
His
confidential
agent
eyed
it
keenly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
approached
a
painful
subject
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
soft
regretful
tone
of
voice
,
irreconcilable
with
his
eager
eye
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
forgive
me
.
<EOS>
I
forget
these
chains
of
association
in
the
interest
I
have
.
<EOS>
Pray
forgive
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
for
all
he
said
,
his
eager
eye
scanned
Mr
Dombey
's
downcast
face
none
the
less
closely
;
and
then
it
shot
a
strange
triumphant
look
at
the
picture
,
as
appealing
to
it
to
bear
witness
how
he
led
him
on
again
,
and
what
was
coming
.
  
<EOS>
"
Carker
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
looking
here
and
there
upon
the
table
,
and
speaking
in
a
somewhat
altered
and
more
hurried
voice
,
and
with
a
paler
lip
,
"
there
is
no
occasion
for
apology
.
<EOS>
You
mistake
.
<EOS>
The
association
is
with
the
matter
in
hand
,
and
not
with
any
recollection
,
as
you
suppose
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
approve
of
Mrs
Dombey
's
behaviour
towards
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
"
I
do
n't
quite
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Understand
then
,
"
returned
Mr
Dombey
,
"
that
you
may
make
that
---
that
you
will
make
that
,
if
you
please
---
matter
of
direct
objection
from
me
to
Mrs
Dombey
.
<EOS>
You
will
please
to
tell
her
that
her
show
of
devotion
for
my
daughter
is
disagreeable
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
likely
to
be
noticed
.
<EOS>
It
is
likely
to
induce
people
to
contrast
Mrs
Dombey
in
her
relation
towards
my
daughter
,
with
Mrs
Dombey
in
her
relation
towards
myself
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
the
goodness
to
let
Mrs
Dombey
know
,
plainly
,
that
I
object
to
it
;
and
that
I
expect
her
to
defer
,
immediately
,
to
my
objection
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Dombey
may
be
in
earnest
,
or
she
may
be
pursuing
a
whim
,
or
she
may
be
opposing
me
;
but
I
object
to
it
in
any
case
,
and
in
every
case
.
<EOS>
If
Mrs
Dombey
is
in
earnest
,
so
much
the
less
reluctant
<EOS>
should
she
be
to
desist
;
for
she
will
not
serve
my
daughter
by
any
such
display
.
<EOS>
If
my
wife
has
any
superfluous
gentleness
and
duty
over
and
above
her
proper
submission
to
me
,
she
may
bestow
themwhere
<EOS>
she
pleases
,
perhaps
;
but
I
will
have
submission
first
!
<EOS>

Carker
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
checking
the
unusual
emotion
with
which
he
had
spoken
,
and
falling
into
a
tone
more
like
that
in
which
he
was
accustomed
to
assert
his
greatness
,
"
you
will
have
the
goodness
not
to
omit
or
slur
this
point
,
but
to
consider
it
a
very
important
part
of
your
instructions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
bowed
his
head
,
and
rising
from
the
table
,
and
standing
thoughtfully
before
the
fire
,
with
his
hand
to
his
smooth
chin
,
looked
down
at
Mr
Dombey
with
the
evil
slyness
of
some
monkish
carving
,
half
human
and
half
brute
;
or
like
a
leering
face
on
an
old
water
-
spout
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
recovering
his
composure
by
degrees
,
or
cooling
his
emotion
in
his
sense
of
having
taken
a
high
position
,
sat
gradually
stiffening
again
,
and
looking
at
the
parrot
as
she
swung
to
and
fro
,
in
her
great
wedding
ring
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
said
Carker
,
after
a
silence
,
suddenly
resuming
his
chair
,
and
drawing
it
opposite
to
Mr
Dombey
's
,
"
but
let
me
understand
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Dombey
is
aware
of
the
probability
of
your
making
me
the
organ
of
your
displeasure
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
rejoined
Carker
,
quickly
;
"
but
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
!
"
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
repeated
,
not
without
hesitation
.
"
Because
I
told
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
"
replied
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
But
why
did
you
tell
her
?
<EOS>
You
see
,
"
he
continued
with
a
smile
,
and
softly
laying
his
velvet
hand
,
as
a
cat
might
have
laid
its
sheathed
claws
,
on
Mr
Dombey
's
arm
;
"
if
I
perfectly
understand
what
is
in
your
mind
,
I
am
so
much
more
likely
to
be
useful
,
and
to
have
the
happiness
of
being
effectually
employed
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
do
understand
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
honour
of
Mrs
Dombey
's
good
opinion
.
<EOS>
In
my
position
,
I
have
no
reason
to
expect
it
;
but
I
take
the
fact
to
be
,
that
I
have
not
got
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Possibly
not
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Consequently
,
"
pursued
Carker
,
"
your
making
these
communications
to
Mrs
Dombey
through
me
,
is
sure
to
be
particularly
unpalatable
to
that
lady
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
appears
to
me
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
with
haughty
reserve
,
and
yet
with
some
embarrassment
,
"
that
Mrs
Dombey
's
views
upon
the
subject
form
no
part
of
it
as
it
presents
itself
to
you
and
me
,
Carker
.
<EOS>
But
it
may
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
---
pardon
me
---
do
I
misconceive
you
,
"
said
Carker
,
"
when
I
think
you
descry
in
this
,
a
likely
means
of
humbling
Mrs
Dombey
's
pride
---
I
use
the
word
as
expressive
of
a
quality
which
,
kept
within
due
bounds
,
adorns
and
graces
a
lady
so
distinguished
for
her
beauty
and
accomplishments
---
and
,
not
to
say
of
punishing
her
,
but
of
reducing
her
to
the
submission
<EOS>
you
so
naturally
and
justly
require
?
"
   
"
I
am
not
accustomed
,
Carker
,
as
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
to
give
such
close
reasons
for
any
course
of
conduct
<EOS>
I
think
proper
to
adopt
,
but
I
will
gainsay
nothing
of
this
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
objection
to
found
upon
it
,
that
is
indeed
another
thing
,
and
the
mere
statement
that
you
have
one
will
be
sufficient
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
not
supposed
,
I
confess
,
that
any
confidence
I
could
intrust
to
you
,
would
be
likely
to
degrade
you
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
degraded
!
"
exclaimed
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
your
service
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
---
or
to
place
you
,
"
pursued
Mr
Dombey
,
"
in
a
false
position
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
in
a
false
position
!
"
exclaimed
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
proud
---
delighted
---
to
execute
your
trust
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
wished
,
I
own
,
to
have
given
the
lady
at
whose
feet
I
would
lay
my
humble
duty
and
devotion
---
for
is
she
not
your
wife
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
no
new
cause
of
dislike
;
but
a
wish
from
you
is
,
of
course
,
paramount
to
every
other
consideration
on
earth
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
when
Mrs
Dombey
is
converted
from
these
little
errors
of
judgment
,
incidental
,
I
would
presume
to
say
,
to
the
novelty
of
her
situation
,
I
shall
hope
that
she
will
perceive
in
the
slight
part
I
take
,
only
a
grain
---
<EOS>
my
removed
and
different
sphere
gives
room
for
little
more
---
of
the
respect
for
you
,
and
sacrifice
of
all
considerations
to
you
,
of
which
it
will
be
her
pleasure
and
privilege
to
garner
up
a
great
store
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
seemed
,
at
the
moment
,
again
to
see
her
with
her
hand
<EOS>
stretched
out
towards
the
door
,
and
again
to
hear
through
the
mild
speech
of
his
confidential
agent
an
echo
of
the
words
,
"
Nothing
can
make
us
stranger
to
each
other
than
we
are
henceforth
!
"
<EOS>
But
he
shook
off
the
fancy
,
and
did
not
shake
in
his
resolution
,
and
said
,
"
Certainly
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
more
,
"
quoth
Carker
,
drawing
his
chair
back
to
its
old
place
---
for
they
had
taken
little
breakfast
as
yet
---
and
pausing
for
an
answer
before
he
sat
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
but
this
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
good
enough
to
observe
,
Carker
,
that
no
message
to
Mrs
Dombey
with
which
you
are
or
may
be
charged
,
admits
of
reply
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
good
enough
to
bring
me
no
reply
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Dombey
is
informed
that
it
does
not
become
me
to
temporise
or
treat
upon
any
matter
that
is
at
issue
between
us
,
and
that
what
I
say
is
final
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
signified
his
understanding
of
these
credentials
,
and
they
fell
to
breakfast
with
what
appetite
they
might
.
<EOS>
The
Grinder
also
,
in
due
time
,
reappeared
,
keeping
his
eyes
upon
his
master
without
a
moment
's
respite
,
and
passing
the
time
in
a
reverie
of
worshipful
terror
.
<EOS>
Breakfast
concluded
,
Mr
Dombey
's
horse
was
ordered
out
again
,
and
Mr
Carker
mounting
his
own
,
they
rode
off
for
the
City
together
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
was
in
capital
spirits
,
and
talked
much
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
received
his
conversation
with
the
sovereign
air
of
a
man
who
had
a
right
to
be
talked
to
,
and
occasionally
condescended
to
throw
in
a
few
words
to
carry
on
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
So
they
rode
on
characteristically
enough
.
<EOS>
But
Mr
Dombey
,
in
his
dignity
,
rode
with
very
long
stirrups
,
and
a
very
loose
rein
,
and
very
rarely
deigned
to
look
down
to
see
where
his
horse
went
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
which
it
happened
that
Mr
Dombey
's
horse
,
while
going
at
a
round
trot
,
stumbled
on
some
loose
stones
,
threw
him
,
rolled
over
him
,
and
lashing
out
with
his
iron
-
shod
feet
,
in
his
struggles
to
get
up
,
kicked
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
,
quick
of
eye
,
steady
of
hand
,
and
a
good
horseman
,
was
afoot
,
and
had
the
struggling
animal
upon
his
legs
and
by
the
bridle
,
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Otherwise
that
morning
's
confidence
would
have
been
Mr
Dombey
's
last
.
<EOS>
Yet
even
with
the
flush
and
hurry
of
this
action
red
upon
him
,
he
bent
over
his
prostrate
chief
with
every
tooth
disclosed
,
and
muttered
as
he
stooped
down
<EOS>
,
"
I
have
given
good
cause
of
offence
to
Mrs
Dombey
now
,
if
she
knew
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
being
insensible
,
and
bleeding
from
the
head
and
face
,
was
carried
by
certain
menders
of
the
road
,
under
Carker
's
direction
,
to
the
nearest
public
-
house
,
which
was
not
far
off
,
and
where
he
was
soon
attended
by
divers
surgeons
,
who
arrived
in
quick
succession
from
all
parts
,
and
who
seemed
to
come
by
some
mysterious
instinct
,
as
vultures
are
said
to
gather
about
a
camel
who
dies
in
the
desert
.
<EOS>
After
being
at
some
pains
to
restore
him
to
consciousness
,
these
gentlemen
examined
into
the
nature
of
his
injuries
.
<EOS>
One
surgeon
who
lived
hard
by
was
strong
for
a
compound
fracture
of
the
leg
,
which
was
the
landlord
's
opinion
also
;
but
two
surgeons
who
lived
at
a
distance
,
and
were
only
in
that
neighbourhood
by
accident
,
combated
this
opinion
so
disinterestedly
,
that
it
was
decided
at
last
that
the
patient
,
though
severely
cut
and
bruised
,
had
broken
no
bones
but
a
lesser
rib
or
so
,
and
might
be
carefully
taken
home
before
night
.
<EOS>
His
injuries
being
dressed
and
bandaged
,
which
was
a
long
operation
,
and
he
at
length
left
to
repose
,
Mr
Carker
mounted
his
horse
again
,
and
rode
away
to
carry
the
intelligence
home
.
  
<EOS>
Crafty
and
cruel
as
his
face
was
at
the
best
of
times
,
though
it
was
a
sufficiently
fair
face
as
to
form
and
regularity
of
feature
<EOS>
,
it
was
at
its
worst
when
he
set
forth
on
this
errand
;
animated
by
the
craft
and
cruelty
of
thoughts
within
him
,
suggestions
of
remote
possibility
rather
than
of
design
or
plot
,
that
made
him
ride
as
if
he
hunted
men
and
women
.
<EOS>
Drawing
rein
at
length
,
and
slackening
in
his
speed
,
as
he
came
into
the
more
public
roads
,
he
checked
his
white
-
legged
horse
into
picking
his
way
along
as
usual
,
and
hid
himself
beneath
his
sleek
,
hushed
,
crouched
manner
,
and
his
ivory
smile
,
as
he
best
could
.
  
<EOS>
He
rode
direct
to
Mr
Dombey
's
house
,
alighted
at
the
door
,
and
begged
to
see
Mrs
Dombey
on
an
affair
of
importance
.
<EOS>
The
servant
who
showed
him
to
Mr
Dombey
's
own
room
,
soon
returned
to
say
that
it
was
not
Mrs
Dombey
's
hour
for
receiving
visitors
,
and
that
he
begged
pardon
for
not
having
mentioned
it
before
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
,
who
was
quite
prepared
for
a
cold
reception
,
wrote
upon
a
card
that
he
must
take
the
liberty
of
pressing
for
an
interview
,
and
that
he
would
not
be
so
bold
as
to
do
so
,
for
the
second
time
(
this
he
underlined
)
,
if
he
were
not
equally
sure
of
the
occasion
being
sufficient
for
his
justification
.
<EOS>
After
a
trifling
delay
,
Mrs
Dombey
's
maid
appeared
,
and
conducted
him
to
a
morning
room
upstairs
,
where
Edith
and
Florence
were
together
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
never
thought
Edith
half
so
beautiful
before
.
<EOS>
Much
as
he
admired
the
graces
of
her
face
and
form
,
and
freshly
as
they
dwelt
within
his
sensual
remembrance
,
he
had
never
thought
her
half
so
beautiful
.
  
<EOS>
Her
glance
fell
haughtily
upon
him
in
the
doorway
;
but
he
looked
at
Florence
---
though
only
in
the
act
of
bending
his
head
,
as
he
came
in
---
with
some
irrepressible
expression
of
the
new
power
he
held
;
and
it
was
his
triumph
to
see
the
glance
droop
and
falter
,
and
to
see
that
Edith
half
rose
up
to
receive
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
very
sorry
<EOS>
,
he
was
deeply
grieved
;
he
could
n't
say
with
what
unwillingness
he
came
to
prepare
her
for
the
intelligence
of
a
very
slight
accident
.
<EOS>
He
entreated
Mrs
Dombey
to
compose
herself
.
<EOS>
Upon
his
sacred
word
of
honour
,
there
was
no
cause
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
But
Mr
Dombey
  
Florence
uttered
a
sudden
cry
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
look
at
her
,
but
at
Edith
.
<EOS>
Edith
composed
and
reassured
her
.
<EOS>
She
uttered
no
cry
of
distress
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
had
met
with
an
accident
in
riding
.
<EOS>
His
horse
had
slipped
,
and
he
had
been
thrown
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
wildly
exclaimed
that
he
was
badly
hurt
;
that
he
was
killed
!
  
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Upon
his
honour
,
Mr
Dombey
,
though
stunned
at
first
,
was
soon
recovered
,
and
though
certainly
hurt
was
in
no
kind
of
danger
.
<EOS>
If
this
were
not
the
truth
,
he
,
the
distressed
intruder
,
never
could
have
had
the
courage
to
present
himself
before
Mrs
Dombey
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
truth
indeed
,
he
solemnly
assured
her
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
he
said
as
if
he
were
answering
Edith
,
and
not
Florence
,
and
with
his
eyes
and
his
smile
fastened
on
Edith
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
went
on
to
tell
her
where
Mr
Dombey
was
lying
,
and
to
request
that
a
carriage
might
be
placed
at
his
disposal
to
bring
him
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mama
,
"
faltered
Florence
in
tears
,
"
if
I
might
venture
to
go
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
,
having
his
eyes
on
Edith
when
he
heard
these
words
,
gave
her
a
secret
look
and
slightly
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
saw
how
she
battled
with
herself
before
she
answered
him
with
her
handsome
eyes
,
but
he
wrested
the
answer
from
her
<EOS>
---
he
showed
her
that
he
would
have
it
,
or
that
he
would
speak
and
cut
Florence
to
the
heart
---
and
she
gave
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
As
he
had
looked
at
the
picture
in
the
morning
,
so
he
looked
at
her
afterwards
,
when
she
turned
her
eyes
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
directed
to
request
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
the
new
housekeeper
---
Mrs
Pipchin
,
I
think
,
is
the
name
---
"
  
Nothing
escaped
him
.
<EOS>
He
saw
in
an
instant
,
that
she
was
another
slight
of
Mr
Dombey
's
on
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
may
be
informed
that
Mr
Dombey
wishes
to
have
his
bed
prepared
in
his
own
apartments
down
stairs
,
as
he
prefers
those
rooms
to
any
other
.
<EOS>
I
shall
return
to
Mr
Dombey
almost
immediately
.
<EOS>
That
every
possible
attention
has
been
paid
to
his
comfort
,
and
that
he
is
the
object
of
every
possible
solicitude
,
I
need
not
assure
you
,
Madam
.
<EOS>
Let
me
again
say
,
there
is
no
cause
for
the
least
alarm
.
<EOS>
Even
you
may
be
quite
at
ease
,
believe
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
bowed
himself
out
,
with
his
extremest
show
of
deference
and
conciliation
;
and
having
returned
to
Mr
Dombey
's
room
,
and
there
arranged
for
a
carriage
being
sent
after
him
to
the
City
,
mounted
his
horse
again
,
and
rode
slowly
thither
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
thoughtful
as
he
went
along
,
and
very
thoughtful
there
,
and
very
thoughtful
in
the
carriage
on
his
way
back
to
the
place
where
Mr
Dombey
had
been
left
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
when
sitting
by
that
gentleman
's
couch
that
he
was
quite
himself
again
,
and
conscious
of
his
teeth
.
  
<EOS>
About
the
time
of
twilight
,
Mr
Dombey
,
grievously
afflicted
with
aches
and
pains
,
was
helped
into
his
carriage
,
and
propped
with
cloaks
and
pillows
on
one
side
of
it
,
while
his
confidential
agent
bore
him
company
upon
the
other
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
not
to
be
shaken
,
they
moved
at
little
more
than
a
foot
pace
;
and
hence
it
was
quite
dark
when
he
was
brought
home
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
,
bitter
and
grim
,
and
not
oblivious
of
the
Peruvian
mines
,
as
the
establishment
in
general
had
good
reason
to
know
,
received
him
at
the
door
,
and
freshened
the
domestics
with
several
little
sprinklings
of
wordy
vinegar
,
while
they
assisted
in
conveying
him
to
his
room
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
remained
in
attendance
until
he
was
safe
in
bed
,
and
then
,
as
he
declined
to
receive
any
female
visitor
,
but
the
excellent
Ogress
who
presided
over
his
household
,
waited
on
Mrs
Dombey
once
more
,
with
his
report
on
her
lord
's
condition
.
  
<EOS>
He
again
found
Edith
alone
with
Florence
,
and
he
again
addressed
the
whole
of
his
soothing
speech
to
Edith
,
as
if
she
were
a
prey
to
the
liveliest
and
most
affectionate
anxieties
.
<EOS>
So
earnest
he
was
in
his
respectful
sympathy
,
that
on
taking
leave
,
he
ventured
---
with
one
more
glance
towards
Florence
at
the
moment
---
to
take
her
hand
,
and
bending
over
it
,
to
touch
it
with
his
lips
.
  
<EOS>
Edith
did
not
withdraw
the
hand
,
nor
did
she
strike
his
fair
face
with
it
,
despite
the
flush
upon
her
cheek
,
the
bright
light
in
her
eyes
,
and
the
dilation
of
her
whole
form
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
was
alone
in
her
own
room
,
she
struck
it
on
the
marble
chimney
-
shelf
,
so
that
,
at
one
blow
,
it
was
bruised
,
and
bled
;
and
held
it
from
her
,
near
the
shining
fire
,
as
if
she
could
have
thrust
it
in
and
burned
it
.
  
<EOS>
Far
into
the
night
she
sat
alone
,
by
the
sinking
blaze
,
in
dark
and
threatening
beauty
,
watching
the
murky
shadows
looming
on
the
wall
,
as
if
her
thoughts
were
tangible
,
and
cast
them
there
.
<EOS>
Whatever
shapes
of
outrage
and
affront
,
and
black
foreshadowings
of
things
that
might
happen
,
flickered
,
indistinct
and
giant
-
like
,
before
her
,
one
resented
figure
marshalled
them
against
her
.
<EOS>
And
that
figure
was
her
husband
.

Chapter
43
.
<EOS>
The
Watches
of
the
Night
 
FLORENCE
,
long
since
awakened
from
her
dream
,
mournfully
observed
the
estrangement
between
her
father
and
Edith
,
and
saw
it
widen
more
and
more
,
and
knew
that
there
was
greater
bitterness
between
them
every
day
.
<EOS>
Each
day
's
added
knowledge
deepened
the
shade
upon
her
love
and
hope
,
roused
up
the
old
sorrow
that
had
slumbered
for
a
little
time
,
and
made
it
even
heavier
to
bear
than
it
had
been
before
.
  
<EOS>
It
had
been
hard
---
how
hard
may
none
but
Florence
ever
know
!
---
to
have
the
natural
affection
of
a
true
and
earnest
nature
turned
to
agony
;
and
slight
,
or
stern
repulse
,
substituted
for
the
tenderest
protection
and
the
dearest
care
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
hard
to
feel
in
her
deep
heart
what
she
had
felt
,
and
never
know
the
happiness
of
one
touch
of
response
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
much
more
hard
to
be
compelled
to
doubt
either
her
father
or
Edith
,
so
affectionate
and
dear
to
her
,
and
to
think
of
her
love
for
each
of
them
,
by
turns
,
with
fear
,
distrust
,
and
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
Florence
now
began
to
do
so
;
and
the
doing
of
it
was
a
task
imposed
upon
her
by
the
very
purity
of
her
soul
,
as
one
she
could
not
fly
from
.
<EOS>
She
saw
her
father
cold
and
obdurate
to
Edith
,
as
to
her
;
hard
,
inflexible
,
unyielding
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
,
she
asked
herself
with
starting
tears
,
that
her
own
dear
mother
had
been
made
unhappy
by
such
treatment
,
and
had
pined
away
and
died
?
<EOS>
Then
she
would
think
how
proud
and
stately
Edith
was
to
every
one
but
her
,
with
what
disdain
<EOS>
she
treated
him
,
how
distantly
she
kept
apart
from
him
,
and
what
she
had
said
on
the
night
when
she
came
home
;
and
quickly
it
would
come
on
Florence
,
almost
as
a
crime
,
that
she
loved
one
who
was
set
in
opposition
to
her
father
,
and
that
her
father
knowing
of
it
,
must
think
of
her
in
his
solitary
room
as
the
unnatural
child
who
added
this
wrong
to
the
old
fault
,
so
much
wept
for
,
of
never
having
won
his
fatherly
affection
from
her
birth
.
<EOS>
The
next
kind
word
from
Edith
,
the
next
kind
glance
,
would
shake
these
thoughts
again
,
and
make
them
seem
like
black
ingratitude
;
for
who
<EOS>
but
she
had
cheered
the
drooping
heart
of
Florence
,
so
lonely
and
so
hurt
,
and
been
its
best
of
comforters
!
<EOS>
Thus
,
with
her
gentle
nature
yearning
to
them
both
,
feeling
the
misery
of
both
,
and
whispering
doubts
of
her
own
duty
to
both
,
Florence
in
her
wider
and
expanded
love
,
and
by
the
side
of
Edith
,
endured
more
than
when
she
had
hoarded
up
her
undivided
secret
in
the
mournful
house
,
and
her
beautiful
Mama
had
never
dawned
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
One
exquisite
unhappiness
that
would
have
far
outweighed
this
,
Florence
was
spared
.
<EOS>
She
never
had
the
least
suspicion
that
Edith
by
her
tenderness
for
her
widened
the
separation
from
her
father
,
or
gave
him
new
cause
of
dislike
.
<EOS>
If
Florence
had
conceived
the
possibility
of
such
an
effect
being
wrought
by
such
a
cause
,
what
grief
she
would
have
felt
,
what
sacrifice
she
would
have
tried
to
make
,
poor
loving
girl
,
how
fast
and
sure
her
quiet
passage
might
have
been
beneath
it
to
the
presence
of
that
higher
Father
who
does
not
reject
his
children
's
love
,
or
spurn
their
tried
and
broken
hearts
,
Heaven
knows!But
<EOS>
it
was
otherwise
,
and
that
was
well
.
  
<EOS>
No
word
was
ever
spoken
between
Florence
and
Edith
now
,
on
these
subjects
.
<EOS>
Edith
had
said
there
ought
to
be
between
them
,
in
that
wise
,
a
division
and
a
silence
like
the
grave
itself
:
and
Florence
felt
that
she
was
right
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
state
of
affairs
her
father
was
brought
home
suffering
and
disabled
:
and
gloomily
retired
to
his
own
rooms
,
where
he
was
tended
by
servants
,
not
approached
by
Edith
,
and
had
no
friend
or
companion
but
Mr
Carker
,
who
withdrew
near
midnight
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
nice
company
he
is
,
Miss
Floy
,
"
said
Susan
Nipper
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
's
a
precious
piece
of
goods
!
<EOS>
If
ever
he
wants
a
character
do
n't
let
him
come
to
me
whatever
he
does
<EOS>
,
that
's
all
I
tell
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Susan
,
"
urged
Florence
,
"
do
n't
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
very
well
to
say
"
do
n't
"
Miss
Floy
,
"
returned
the
Nipper
,
much
exasperated
;
"
but
raly
begging
your
pardon
we
're
coming
to
such
passes
that
it
turns
all
the
blood
in
a
person
's
body
into
pins
and
needles
,
with
their
pints
all
ways
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
mistake
me
,
Miss
Floy
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
mean
nothing
again
your
ma
-
in
-
law
who
has
always
treated
me
as
a
lady
<EOS>
should
though
she
is
rather
high
<EOS>
I
must
say
not
that
I
have
any
right
to
object
to
that
particular
,
but
when
we
come
to
Mrs
Pipchinses
and
having
them
put
over
us
and
keeping
guard
at
your
pa
's
door
like
crocodiles
(
only
make
us
thankful
that
they
lay
no
eggs
!
)
<EOS>
we
are
a
growing
too
outrageous
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
thinks
well
of
Mrs
Pipchin
,
Susan
,
"
returned
Florence
,
"
and
has
a
right
to
choose
his
housekeeper
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
Miss
Floy
,
"
returned
the
Nipper
,
"
when
you
say
do
n't
,
I
never
do
I
hope
<EOS>
but
Mrs
Pipchin
acts
like
early
gooseberries
upon
me
Miss
,
and
nothing
less
.
"
  
<EOS>
Susan
was
unusually
emphatic
and
destitute
of
punctuation
in
her
discourse
on
this
night
,
which
was
the
night
of
Mr
Dombey
's
being
brought
home
,
because
,
having
been
sent
down
stairs
by
Florence
to
inquire
after
him
,
she
had
been
obliged
to
deliver
her
message
to
her
mortal
enemy
Mrs
Pipchin
;
who
,
without
carrying
it
in
to
Mr
Dombey
,
had
taken
upon
herself
to
return
what
Miss
Nipper
called
a
huffish
answer
,
on
her
own
responsibility
.
<EOS>
This
,
Susan
Nipper
construed
into
presumption
on
the
part
of
that
exemplary
sufferer
by
the
Peruvian
mines
,
and
a
deed
of
disparagement
upon
her
young
lady
,
that
was
not
to
be
forgiven
;
and
so
far
her
emphatic
state
was
special
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
been
in
a
condition
of
greatly
increased
suspicion
and
distrust
,
ever
since
the
marriage
;
for
,
like
most
persons
of
her
quality
of
mind
,
who
form
a
strong
and
sincere
attachment
to
one
in
the
different
station
which
Florence
occupied
,
Susan
was
very
jealous
,
and
her
jealousy
naturally
attached
to
Edith
,
who
divided
her
old
empire
,
and
came
between
them
.
<EOS>
Proud
and
glad
as
Susan
Nipper
truly
was
,
that
her
young
mistress
should
be
advanced
towards
her
proper
place
in
the
scene
of
her
old
neglect
,
and
that
she
should
have
her
father
's
handsome
wife
for
her
companion
and
protectress
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
relinquish
any
part
of
her
own
dominion
to
the
handsome
wife
,
without
a
grudge
and
a
vague
feeling
of
ill
-
will
,
for
which
she
did
not
fail
to
find
a
disinterested
justification
in
her
sharp
perception
of
the
pride
and
passion
of
the
lady
's
character
.
<EOS>
From
the
background
to
which
she
had
necessarily
retired
somewhat
,
since
the
marriage
,
Miss
Nipper
looked
on
,
therefore
,
at
domestic
affairs
in
general
,
with
a
resolute
conviction
that
no
good
would
come
of
Mrs
Dombey
:
always
being
very
careful
to
publish
on
all
possible
occasions
,
that
she
had
nothing
to
say
against
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Susan
,
"
said
Florence
,
who
was
sitting
thoughtfully
at
her
table
,
"
it
is
very
late
.
<EOS>
I
shall
want
nothing
more
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Miss
Floy
!
"
returned
the
Nipper
,
"
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
often
wish
for
them
old
times
when
I
sat
up
with
you
hours
later
than
this
and
fell
asleep
through
being
tired
out
when
you
was
as
broad
awake
as
spectacles
,
but
you
've
ma's
-
in
-
law
to
come
and
sit
with
you
now
Miss
Floy
<EOS>
and
I
'm
thankful
for
it
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
I
've
not
a
word
to
say
against
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
forget
who
was
my
old
companion
when
I
had
none
,
Susan
,
"
returned
Florence
,
gently
,
"
never
.
"
<EOS>
And
looking
up
,
she
put
her
arm
<EOS>
round
the
neck
of
her
humble
friend
,
drew
her
face
down
to
hers
,
and
bidding
her
good
night
,
kissed
it
;
which
so
mollified
Miss
Nipper
,
that
she
fell
a
sobbing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
my
dear
Miss
Floy
,
"
said
Susan
,
"
let
me
go
down
stairs
again
and
see
how
your
pa
is
,
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
you
're
wretched
about
him
,
do
let
me
go
downstairs
again
and
knock
at
his
door
my
own
self
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
We
shall
hear
more
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
I
will
inquire
myself
in
the
morning

Mama
has
been
down
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
;
"
Florence
blushed
,
for
she
had
no
such
hope
;
"
or
is
there
now
,
perhaps
,
Good
night
!

<EOS>
Susan
was
too
much
softened
to
express
her
private
opinion
on
the
probability
of
Mrs
Dombey
's
being
in
attendance
on
her
husband
;
and
silently
withdrew
.
<EOS>
Florence
left
alone
,
soon
hid
her
head
upon
her
hands
as
she
had
often
done
in
other
days
,
and
did
not
restrain
the
tears
from
coursing
down
her
face
.
<EOS>
The
misery
of
this
domestic
discord
and
unhappiness
;
the
withered
hope
she
cherished
now
,
if
hope
it
could
be
called
,
of
ever
being
taken
to
her
father
's
heart
;
her
doubts
and
fears
between
the
two
;
the
yearning
of
her
innocent
breast
to
both
;
the
heavy
disappointment
and
regret
of
such
an
end
as
this
,
to
what
had
been
a
vision
of
bright
hope
and
promise
to
her
;
all
crowded
on
her
mind
and
made
her
tears
flow
fast
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
and
her
brother
dead
,
her
father
unmoved
towards
her
,
<EOS>
Edith
opposed
to
him
and
casting
him
away
,
but
loving
her
,
and
loved
by
her
<EOS>
,
it
seemed
as
if
her
affection
could
never
prosper
,
rest
where
it
would
.
<EOS>
That
weak
thought
was
soon
hushed
,
but
the
thoughts
in
which
it
had
arisen
were
too
true
and
strong
to
be
dismissed
with
it
;
and
they
made
the
night
desolate
.
  
<EOS>
Among
such
reflections
there
rose
up
,
as
there
had
risen
up
all
day
,
the
image
of
her
father
,
wounded
and
in
pain
,
alone
in
his
own
room
,
untended
by
those
who
should
be
nearest
to
him
,
and
passing
the
tardy
hours
in
lonely
suffering
.
<EOS>
A
frightened
thought
which
made
her
start
and
clasp
her
hands
 
---
though
it
was
not
a
new
one
in
her
mind
---
that
the
might
die
,
and
never
see
her
or
pronounce
her
name
,
thrilled
her
whole
frame
.
<EOS>
In
her
agitation
she
thought
,
and
trembled
while
she
thought
,
of
once
more
stealing
down
stairs
,
and
venturing
to
his
door
.
  
<EOS>
She
listened
at
her
own
.
<EOS>
The
house
was
quiet
,
and
all
the
lights
were
out
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
,
long
time
,
she
thought
,
since
she
used
to
make
her
nightly
pilgrimages
to
his
door
!
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
,
long
time
,
she
tried
to
think
,
since
she
had
entered
his
room
at
midnight
,
and
he
had
led
her
back
to
the
stair
-
foot
!
  
<EOS>
With
the
same
child
's
heart
within
her
,
as
of
old
:
even
with
the
child
's
sweet
timid
eyes
and
clustering
hair
:
Florence
,
as
strange
to
her
father
in
her
early
maiden
bloom
,
as
in
her
nursery
time
,
crept
down
the
staircase
listening
as
she
went
,
and
drew
near
to
his
room
.
<EOS>
No
one
was
stirring
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
party
open
to
admit
air
;
and
all
was
so
still
within
,
that
she
could
hear
the
burning
of
the
fire
,
and
count
the
ticking
of
the
clock
that
stood
upon
the
chimney
-
piece
.
  
<EOS>
She
looked
in
.
<EOS>
In
that
room
,
the
housekeeper
wrapped
in
a
blanket
was
fast
asleep
in
an
easy
chair
before
the
fire
.
<EOS>
The
doors
between
it
and
the
next
were
partly
closed
,
and
a
screen
was
drawn
before
them
;
but
there
was
a
light
there
,
and
it
shone
upon
the
cornice
of
his
bed
.
<EOS>
All
was
so
very
still
that
she
could
hear
from
his
breathing
that
he
was
asleep
.
<EOS>
This
gave
her
courage
to
pass
round
the
screen
,
and
look
into
his
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
as
great
a
start
to
come
upon
his
sleeping
face
as
if
she
had
not
expected
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
Florence
stood
arrested
on
the
spot
,
and
if
he
had
awakened
then
,
must
have
remained
there
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
cut
upon
his
forehead
,
and
they
had
been
wetting
his
hair
,
which
lay
bedabbled
and
entangled
on
the
pillow
.
<EOS>
One
of
his
arms
,
resting
outside
the
bed
,
was
bandaged
up
,
and
he
was
very
white
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
this
,
that
after
the
first
quick
glance
,
and
first
assurance
of
his
sleeping
quietly
,
held
Florence
rooted
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
It
was
something
very
different
from
this
,
and
more
than
this
,
that
made
him
look
so
solemn
in
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
never
seen
his
face
in
all
her
life
,
but
there
had
been
upon
it
---
or
she
fancied
so
---
some
disturbing
consciousness
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
seen
his
face
in
all
her
life
,
but
hope
had
sunk
within
her
,
and
her
timid
glance
had
drooped
before
its
stern
,
unloving
,
and
repelling
harshness
.
<EOS>
As
she
looked
upon
it
now
,
she
saw
it
,
for
the
first
time
,
free
from
the
cloud
that
had
darkened
her
childhood
.
<EOS>
Calm
,
tranquil
night
was
reigning
in
its
stead
.
<EOS>
Her
might
have
gone
to
sleep
,
for
anything
she
saw
there
,
blessing
her
.
  
<EOS>
Awake
,
unkind
father
!
<EOS>
Awake
,
now
,
sullen
man
!
<EOS>
The
time
is
flitting
by
;
the
hour
is
coming
with
an
angry
tread
.
<EOS>
Awake
!
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
change
upon
his
face
;
and
as
she
watched
it
,
awfully
,
its
motionless
repose
recalled
the
faces
that
were
gone
.
<EOS>
So
they
looked
,
so
would
he
;
so
<EOS>
she
,
his
weeping
child
,
who
should
say
when
!
<EOS>
so
all
the
world
of
love
and
hatred
and
indifference
around
them
!
<EOS>
When
that
time
should
come
,
it
would
not
be
the
heavier
to
him
,
for
this
that
she
was
going
to
do
;
and
it
might
fall
something
lighter
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
stole
close
to
the
bed
,
and
drawing
in
her
breath
bent
down
,
and
softly
kissed
him
on
the
face
,
and
laid
her
own
for
one
brief
moment
by
its
side
,
and
put
the
arm
,
with
which
she
dared
not
touch
him
,
round
about
him
on
the
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
Awake
,
doomed
man
,
while
she
is
near
.
<EOS>
The
time
is
flitting
by
;
the
hour
is
coming
with
an
angry
tread
;
its
food
is
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Awake
!
  
<EOS>
In
her
mind
,
she
prayed
to
God
to
bless
her
father
,
and
to
soften
him
towards
her
,
if
it
might
be
so
;
and
if
not
,
to
forgive
him
if
he
was
wrong
,
and
pardon
her
the
prayer
which
almost
seemed
impiety
.
<EOS>
And
doing
so
,
and
looking
back
at
him
with
blinded
eyes
,
and
stealing
timidly
away
,
passed
out
of
his
room
,
and
crossed
the
other
,
and
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
He
may
sleep
on
now
.
<EOS>
He
may
sleep
on
while
he
may
.
<EOS>
But
let
him
look
for
that
slight
figure
when
he
wakes
,
and
find
it
near
him
when
the
hour
is
come
!
  
<EOS>
Sad
and
grieving
was
the
heart
of
Florence
,
as
she
crept
upstairs
.
<EOS>
The
quiet
house
had
grown
more
dismal
since
she
came
down
.
<EOS>
The
sleep
she
had
been
looking
on
,
in
the
dead
on
night
,
had
the
solemnity
to
her
of
death
and
life
in
one
.
<EOS>
The
secrecy
and
silence
of
her
own
proceeding
made
the
night
secret
,
silent
,
and
oppressive
.
<EOS>
She
felt
unwilling
,
almost
unable
,
to
go
on
to
her
own
chamber
;
and
turning
into
the
drawing
-
rooms
,
where
the
clouded
moon
was
shining
through
the
blinds
,
looked
out
into
the
empty
streets
.
  
<EOS>
The
wind
was
blowing
drearily
.
<EOS>
The
lamps
looked
pale
,
and
shook
as
if
they
were
cold
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
distant
glimmer
of
something
that
was
not
quite
darkness
,
rather
than
of
light
,
in
the
sky
;
and
foreboding
night
was
shivering
and
restless
,
as
the
dying
are
who
make
a
troubled
end
.
<EOS>
Florence
remembered
how
,
as
a
watcher
,
by
a
sick
-
bed
,
she
had
noted
this
bleak
time
,
and
felt
its
influence
,
as
if
in
some
hidden
natural
antipathy
to
it
;
and
now
it
was
very
,
very
gloomy
.
  
<EOS>
Her
Mama
had
not
come
to
her
room
that
night
,
which
was
one
cause
of
<EOS>
her
having
sat
late
out
of
her
bed
.
<EOS>
In
her
general
uneasiness
,
no
less
than
in
her
ardent
longing
to
have
somebody
to
speak
to
,
and
to
break
the
spell
of
gloom
and
silence
,
Florence
directed
her
steps
towards
the
chamber
where
she
slept
.
  
<EOS>
The
door
was
not
fastened
within
,
and
yielded
smoothly
to
her
hesitating
hand
.
<EOS>
She
was
surprised
to
find
a
bright
light
burning
;
still
more
surprised
,
on
looking
in
,
to
see
that
her
Mama
,
but
partially
undressed
,
was
sitting
near
the
ashes
of
the
fire
,
which
had
crumbled
and
dropped
away
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
intently
bent
upon
the
air
;
and
in
their
light
,
and
in
her
face
,
and
in
her
form
,
and
in
the
grasp
with
which
she
held
the
elbows
of
her
chair
as
if
about
to
start
up
,
Florence
saw
such
fierce
emotion
that
it
terrified
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mama
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
"
what
is
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
started
;
looking
at
her
with
such
a
strange
dread
in
her
face
,
that
Florence
was
more
frightened
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mama
!
<EOS>
"
said
Florence
,
hurriedly
advancing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
Mama!what
is
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
been
well
,
"
said
Edith
,
shaking
,
and
still
looking
at
her
in
the
same
strange
way
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
bad
dreams
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
not
yet
been
to
bed
,
Mama
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
returned
.
<EOS>
"
Half
-
waking
dreams
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
features
gradually
softened
;
and
suffering
Florence
to
come
closer
to
her
,
within
her
embrace
,
she
said
in
a
tender
manner
,
"
But
what
does
my
bird
do
here
?
<EOS>
What
does
my
bird
do
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
uneasy
,
Mama
,
in
not
seeing
you
to
-
night
,
and
in
not
knowing
how
Papa
was
;
and
I
"
  
Florence
stopped
there
,
and
said
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
late
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Edith
,
fondly
putting
back
the
curls
that
mingled
with
her
own
dark
hair
,
and
strayed
upon
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
late
.
<EOS>
Near
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Near
day
!
<EOS>
"
she
repeated
in
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Mama
,
what
have
you
done
to
your
hand
?
"
said
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
Edith
drew
it
suddenly
away
,
and
,
for
a
moment
,
looked
at
her
with
the
same
strange
dread
<EOS>
(
there
was
a
sort
of
wild
avoidance
in
it
)
as
before
;
but
she
presently
said
,
"
Nothing
,
nothing
.
<EOS>
A
blow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
then
she
said
,
"
<EOS>
My
Florence
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
her
bosom
heaved
,
and
she
was
weeping
passionately
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mama
!
"
said
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
Mama
,
what
can
I
do
,
what
should
I
do
,
to
make
us
happier
?
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
she
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
of
that
?
<EOS>
Can
it
never
be
?
<EOS>
If
I
speak
now
of
what
is
in
my
thoughts
,
in
spite
of
what
we
have
agreed
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
you
will
not
blame
me
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
useless
,
"
she
replied
,
"
useless
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
,
dear
,
that
I
have
had
bad
dreams
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
change
them
,
or
prevent
their
coming
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
,
"
said
Florence
,
gazing
on
her
agitated
face
,
which
seemed
to
darken
as
she
looked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
dreamed
,
"
said
Edith
in
a
low
voice
,
"
of
a
pride
that
is
all
powerless
for
good
,
all
powerful
for
evil
;
of
a
pride
that
has
been
galled
and
goaded
,
through
many
shameful
years
,
and
has
never
recoiled
except
upon
itself
;
a
pride
that
has
debased
its
owner
with
the
consciousness
of
deep
humiliation
,
and
never
helped
its
owner
boldly
to
resent
it
or
avoid
it
,
or
to
say
,
"
This
shall
not
be
!
"
<EOS>
a
pride
that
,
rightly
guided
,
might
have
led
perhaps
to
better
things
,
but
which
,
misdirected
and
perverted
,
like
all
else
belonging
to
the
same
possessor
,
has
been
self
-
contempt
,
mere
hardihood
,
and
ruin
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
neither
looked
nor
spoke
to
Florence
now
,
but
went
on
as
if
she
were
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
dreamed
,
"
she
said
,
"
of
such
indifference
and
callousness
,
arising
from
this
self
-
contempt
;
this
wretched
,
inefficient
,
miserable
pride
;
that
it
has
gone
on
with
listless
steps
even
to
the
altar
,
yielding
to
the
old
,
familiar
,
beckoning
finger
,
---
<EOS>
oh
mother
,
<EOS>
oh
mother
!
<EOS>
---
while
it
spurned
it
;
and
willing
to
be
hateful
to
itself
for
once
and
for
all
,
rather
than
to
be
stung
daily
in
some
new
form
.
<EOS>
Mean
,
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
now
with
gathering
and
darkening
emotion
,
she
looked
as
she
had
looked
when
Florence
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
have
dreamed
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
in
a
first
late
effort
to
achieve
a
purpose
,
it
has
been
trodden
on
,
and
trodden
down
by
a
base
foot
,
but
turns
and
looks
upon
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
dreamed
that
it
is
wounded
,
hunted
,
set
upon
by
dogs
,
but
that
it
stands
at
bay
,
and
will
not
yield
;
<EOS>
no
,
that
it
can
not
if
it
would
;
but
that
it
is
urged
on
to
hate
him
,
rise
against
him
,
and
defy
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Her
clenched
hand
tightened
on
the
trembling
arm
she
had
in
hers
,
and
as
she
looked
down
on
the
alarmed
and
wondering
face
,
her
own
subsided
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
Florence
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
I
think
I
have
been
nearly
mad
to
-
night
!
"
and
humbled
her
proud
head
upon
her
neck
,
and
wept
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
leave
me
!
<EOS>
be
near
me
!
<EOS>
I
have
no
hope
but
in
you
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
These
words
she
said
a
score
of
times
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
she
grew
calmer
,
and
was
full
of
pity
for
the
tears
of
Florence
,
and
for
her
waking
at
such
untimely
hours
.
<EOS>
And
the
day
now
drawing
,
Edith
folded
her
in
her
arms
and
laid
her
down
upon
her
bed
,
and
,
not
lying
down
herself
,
sat
by
her
,
and
bade
her
try
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
you
are
weary
,
dearest
,
and
unhappy
,
and
should
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
indeed
unhappy
,
dear
Mama
,
to
-
night
,
"
said
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
weary
and
unhappy
,
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
when
you
lie
asleep
so
near
me
,
sweet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
kissed
each
other
,
and
Florence
,
worn
out
,
gradually
fell
into
a
gentle
slumber
;
but
as
her
eyes
closed
on
the
face
beside
her
,
it
was
so
sad
to
think
upon
the
face
down
stairs
,
that
her
hand
drew
closer
to
Edith
for
some
comfort
;
yet
,
even
in
the
act
,
it
faltered
,
lest
it
should
he
deserting
him
.
<EOS>
So
,
in
her
sleep
,
she
tried
to
reconcile
the
two
together
,
and
to
show
them
that
she
loved
them
both
,
but
could
not
do
it
,
and
her
waking
grief
was
part
of
her
dreams
.
   
<EOS>
Edith
,
sitting
by
,
looked
down
at
the
dark
eyelashes
lying
wet
on
the
flushed
cheeks
,
and
looked
with
gentleness
and
pity
,
for
she
knew
the
truth
.
<EOS>
But
no
sleep
hung
upon
her
own
eyes
.
<EOS>
As
the
day
came
on
she
still
sat
watching
and
waking
,
with
the
placid
hand
in
hers
,
and
sometimes
whispered
,
as
she
looked
at
the
hushed
face
,
"
Be
near
me
,
Florence
,
I
have
no
hope
<EOS>
but
in
you
!

<EOS>
A
Separation
 
WITH
the
day
,
though
not
so
early
as
the
sun
,
uprose
Miss
Susan
Nipper
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
heaviness
in
this
young
maiden
's
exceedingly
sharp
black
eyes
,
that
abated
somewhat
of
their
sparkling
,
and
suggested
---
which
was
not
their
usual
character
---
the
possibility
of
their
being
sometimes
shut
.
<EOS>
There
was
likewise
a
swollen
look
about
them
,
as
if
they
had
been
crying
over
-
night
.
<EOS>
But
the
Nipper
,
so
far
from
being
cast
down
,
was
singularly
brisk
and
bold
,
and
all
her
energies
appeared
to
be
braced
up
for
some
great
feat
.
<EOS>
This
was
noticeable
even
in
her
dress
,
which
was
much
more
tight
and
trim
than
usual
;
and
in
occasional
twitches
of
her
head
as
she
went
about
the
house
,
which
were
mightily
expressive
of
determination
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
she
had
formed
a
determination
,
and
an
aspiring
one
:
it
being
nothing
less
than
this
---
to
penetrate
to
Mr
Dombey
's
presence
,
and
have
speech
of
that
gentleman
alone
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
said
I
would
,
"
she
remarked
,
in
a
threatening
manner
,
to
herself
,
that
morning
,
with
many
twitches
of
her
head
,
"
and
now
I
will
!
"
  
<EOS>
Spurring
herself
on
to
the
accomplishment
of
this
desperate
design
,
with
a
sharpness
that
was
peculiar
to
herself
,
Susan
Nipper
haunted
the
hall
and
staircase
during
the
whole
forenoon
,
without
finding
a
favourable
opportunity
for
the
assault
.
<EOS>
Not
at
all
baffled
by
this
discomfiture
,
which
indeed
had
a
stimulating
effect
,
and
put
her
on
her
mettle
,
she
diminished
nothing
of
her
vigilance
;
and
at
last
discovered
,
towards
evening
,
that
her
sworn
foe
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
,
under
pretence
of
having
sat
up
all
night
,
was
dozing
in
her
own
room
,
and
that
Mr
Dombey
was
lying
on
his
sofa
,
unattended
.
  
<EOS>
With
a
twitch
---
not
of
her
head
merely
,
this
time
,
but
of
her
whole
self
---
the
Nipper
went
on
tiptoe
to
Mr
Dombey
's
door
,
and
knocked
.
<EOS>
"
Come
in
!
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
Susan
encouraged
herself
with
a
final
twitch
,
and
went
in
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
who
was
eyeing
the
fire
,
gave
an
amazed
look
at
his
visitor
,
and
raised
himself
a
little
on
his
arm
.
<EOS>
The
Nipper
dropped
a
curtsey
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
Sir
,
I
wish
to
speak
to
you
.
"
said
Susan
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
moved
his
lips
as
if
he
were
repeating
the
words
,
but
he
seemed
so
lost
in
astonishment
at
the
presumption
of
the
young
woman
as
to
be
incapable
of
giving
them
utterance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
in
your
service
,
Sir
,
"
said
Susan
Nipper
,
with
her
usual
rapidity
,
"
now
twelve
year
a
waiting
on
Miss
Floy
<EOS>
my
own
young
lady
who
could
n't
speak
plain
when
I
first
come
here
<EOS>
and
I
was
old
in
this
house
when
Mrs
Richards
was
new
<EOS>
,
I
may
not
be
Meethosalem
,
but
I
am
not
a
child
in
arms
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
raised
upon
his
arm
and
looking
at
her
,
offered
no
comment
on
this
preparatory
statement
of
facts
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
never
was
a
dearer
or
a
blesseder
young
lady
than
is
my
young
lady
,
Sir
,
"
said
Susan
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
ought
to
know
a
great
deal
better
than
some
for
<EOS>
I
have
seen
her
in
her
grief
<EOS>
and
I
have
seen
her
in
her
joy
<EOS>
(
there
's
not
been
much
of
it
)
and
I
have
seen
her
with
her
brother
<EOS>
and
I
have
seen
her
in
her
loneliness
and
some
have
never
seen
her
,
and
I
say
to
some
and
all
---
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
and
here
the
black
-
eyed
shook
her
head
,
and
slightly
stamped
her
foot
;
"
that
she
's
blessedest
and
dearest
angel
is
Miss
Floy
that
ever
drew
the
breath
of
life
,
the
more
that
I
was
torn
to
pieces
Sir
<EOS>
the
more
I
'd
say
it
though
I
may
not
be
a
Fox
's
Martyr
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
turned
yet
paler
than
his
fall
had
made
him
,
with
indignation
and
astonishment
;
and
kept
his
eyes
upon
the
speaker
as
if
he
accused
them
,
and
his
ears
too
,
of
playing
him
false
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
one
could
be
anything
but
true
and
faithful
to
Miss
Floy
,
Sir
,
"
pursued
Susan
,
"
and
I
take
no
merit
for
my
service
of
twelve
year
,
for
I
love
her
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
yes
,
I
say
to
some
and
all
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
---
and
here
the
black
-
eyed
shook
her
head
again
,
and
slightly
stamped
her
foot
again
,
and
checked
a
sob
;
"
but
true
and
faithful
service
gives
me
right
to
speak
<EOS>
I
hope
,
and
speak
I
must
and
will
now
,
right
or
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
woman
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
glaring
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
dare
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
mean
,
Sir
,
is
to
speak
respectful
and
without
offence
,
but
out
,
and
how
I
dare
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
not
<EOS>
but
I
do
!
"
said
Susan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
do
n't
know
my
young
lady
<EOS>
Sir
you
do
n't
indeed
,
you
'd
never
know
so
little
of
her
,
if
you
did
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
in
a
fury
,
put
his
hand
out
for
the
bell
-
rope
;
but
there
was
no
bell
-
rope
on
that
side
of
the
fire
,
and
he
could
not
rise
and
cross
to
the
other
without
assistance
.
<EOS>
The
quick
eye
of
the
Nipper
detected
his
helplessness
immediately
,
and
now
,
as
she
afterwards
observed
,
she
felt
she
had
got
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Floy
,
"
said
Susan
Nipper
,
"
is
the
most
devoted
and
most
patient
and
most
dutiful
and
beautiful
of
daughters
,
there
an't
<EOS>
no
gentleman
,
no
Sir
,
though
as
great
and
rich
as
all
the
greatest
and
richest
of
England
put
together
,
but
might
be
proud
of
her
and
would
and
ought
.
<EOS>
If
he
knew
her
value
right
,
he
'd
rather
lose
his
greatness
and
his
fortune
piece
by
piece
and
beg
his
way
in
rags
from
door
to
door
,
I
say
to
some
and
all
,
he
would
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Susan
Nipper
,
bursting
into
tears
,
"
than
bring
the
sorrow
on
her
tender
heart
that
I
have
seen
it
suffer
in
this
house
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Woman
,
"
cried
Mr
Dombey
,
"
leave
the
room

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Begging
your
pardon
,
not
even
if
I
am
to
leave
the
situation
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
steadfast
Nipper
,
"
in
which
I
have
been
so
many
years
and
seen
so
much
---
although
I
hope
you
'd
never
have
the
heart
to
send
me
from
Miss
Floy
for
such
a
cause
<EOS>
---
will
I
go
now
till
I
have
said
the
rest
,
I
may
not
be
a
Indian
widow
<EOS>
Sir
and
I
am
not
and
I
would
not
so
become
<EOS>
but
if
I
once
made
up
my
mind
to
burn
myself
alive
,
I
'd
do
it
!
<EOS>
And
I
've
made
my
mind
up
to
go
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
Which
was
rendered
no
less
clear
by
the
expression
of
Susan
Nipper
's
countenance
,
than
by
her
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
an't
a
person

your
service

Sir

pursued
the
blackeyed
,
"
that
has
always
stood
more
in
awe
of
you

me

you
may
think
how
true
it
is
when
I
make
so
bold
as
say
that
I
have
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
times
thought
of
speaking
to
you
and
never
been
able
to
make
my
mind
up
to
it

last
night

last
night
decided
of
me

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
in
a
paroxysm
of
rage
,
made
another
grasp
at
the
bell
-
rope
that
was
not
there
,
and
,
in
its
absence
,
pulled
his
hair
rather
than
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
,
"
said
Susan
Nipper
,
"
Miss
Floy
strive
and
strive
when
nothing

a
child
so
sweet
and
patient
that
the
best
of
women
might
have
copied
from
her

I
've
seen
her
sitting
nights
together
half
the
night
through
to
help
her
delicate
brother

his
learning

I
've
seen
her
helping
him

watching
him
at
other
times

<EOS>
some
well
know
<EOS>
when

I
've
seen
her
,
with
no
encouragement

no
help
,
grow
up
to
be
a
lady

thank
God

<EOS>
that
is
the
grace
and
pride
of
every
company
she
goes
in

I
've
always
seen
her
cruelly
neglected
and
keenly
feeling
of
it

<EOS>
I
say
to
some

all

I
have

and
never
said
one
word

but
ordering
one
's
self
lowly
and
reverently
towards
one
's
betters
,
is
not
to
be
a
worshipper
of
graven
images

I
will
and
must
speak
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anybody
there

cried
Mr
Dombey
,
calling
out
.
<EOS>
"
Where

men

<EOS>
where

the
women

<EOS>
Is

<EOS>
"
I
left
my
dear
young
lady
out
of
bed
late
last
night

said
Susan
,
nothing
checked
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
knew
why
,
for
you
was
ill

Sir
<EOS>

she
did
n't
know
how
ill
<EOS>
and
that
was
enough
to
make
her
wretched
as
I
saw
it
did
.
<EOS>
I
may
not
be
a
Peacock
;
but
I
have
my
eyes
---
and
I
sat
up
a
little
in
my
own
room
thinking
she
might
be
lonesome
and
might
want
me
,
and
I
saw
her
steal
down
stairs
and
come
to
this
door
as
if
it
was
a
guilty
thing
to
look
at
her
own
Pa
,
and
then
steal
back
again
and
go
into
them
lonely
drawing
-
rooms
,
a
crying
so
,
that
I
could
hardly
bear
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
hear
it

"
said
Susan
Nipper
,
wiping
her
black
eyes
,
and
fixing
them
undauntingly
on
Mr
Dombey
's
infuriated
face
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
the
first
time
I
have
heard
it

not
by

many
a

you
do

cried
Susan
Nipper
,
in
a
final
burst

that
it
's
a
sinful
shame

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why

hoity
toity

"
cried
the
voice
of
Mrs
Pipchin
,
as
the
black
bombazeen
garments
of
that
fair
Peruvian
Miner
swept
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
this
,
indeed
?
"
  
<EOS>
Susan
favoured
Mrs
Pipchin
with
a
look
she
had
invented
expressly
for
her
when
they
first
became
acquainted
,
and
resigned
the
reply
to
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
this
?
"
<EOS>
repeated
Mr
Dombey
,
almost
foaming
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
's
this

Madam

<EOS>
You
who
are

this

keep
it

have
reason
to
inquire

Do

<EOS>
"
I

croaked
Mrs

.

"
How

But
the
inflexible
Nipper

honouring
Mrs
Pipchin
with
another
look
,
remained
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
call
it
managing
this
establishment
,
Madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
"
to
leave
a
person
like
this
at
liberty
to
come
and
talk
to
me
!
<EOS>
A
gentleman
---
in
his
own
house
---
in
his
own
room
---
assailed
with
the
impertinences
of
women
-
servants
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Pipchin
,
with
vengeance
in
her
hard
grey
eye
,
"
<EOS>
I
exceedingly
deplore
it
;
nothing
can
be
more
irregular
;
nothing
can
be
more
out
of
all
bounds
and
reason
;
but
I
regret
to
say
,
Sir
,
that
this
young
woman
is
quite
beyond
control
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
spoiled
by
Miss
Dombey
,
and
is
amenable
to
nobody
.
<EOS>
You
know
you
're
not
,
"
said
Mrs
Pipchin
,
sharply
,
and
shaking
her
head
at
Susan
Nipper
.
<EOS>
"
For
shame
,
you
hussy
!
<EOS>
Go
along
with
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
find
people
in
my
service
who
are
not
to
be
controlled
,
Mrs
Pipchin
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
,
turning
back
towards
the
fire
,
"
you
know
what
to
do
with
them
,
I
presume
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
you
are
here
for
?
<EOS>
Take
her
away
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
know
what
to
do
,
"
retorted
Mrs
Pipchin
,
"
and
of
course
shall
do
it
.
<EOS>
Susan
Nipper
,
"
snapping
her
up
particularly
short
,
"
a
month
's
warning
from
this
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
indeed
!
"
cried
Susan
,
loftily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
returned
Mrs
Pipchin
,
"
and
do
n't
smile
at
me
<EOS>
,
you
minx
,
or
I
'll
know
the
reason
why
!
<EOS>
Go
along
with
you
this
minute
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
intend
to
go
this
minute
,
you
may
rely
upon
it
,
"
said
the
voluble
Nipper
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
in
this
house
waiting
on
my
young
lady
a
dozen
year
<EOS>
and
I
wo
n't
stop
in
it
one
hour
under
notice
from
a
person
owning
to
the
name
of
Pipchin
,
trust
me
,
Mrs
P.
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
good
riddance
of
bad
rubbish
!
"
said
that
wrathful
old
lady
.
"
<EOS>
Get
along
with
you
,
or
I
'll
have
you
carried
out
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
comfort
is
,
"
said
Susan
,
looking
back
at
Mr
Dombey
,
"
that
I
have
told
a
piece
of
truth
this
day
which
ought
to
have
been
told
long
before
and
ca
n't
be
told
too
often
or
too
plain
and
that
no
amount
of
Pipchinses
<EOS>
---
I
hope
the
number
of
'em
may
n't
be
great
"
(
here
Mrs
Pipchin
uttered
a
very
sharp
"
Go
along
with
you
!
"
<EOS>
and
Miss
Nipper
repeated
the
look
)
"
can
unsay
what
I
have
said
,
though
they
gave
a
whole
year
full
of
warnings
beginning
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
forenoon
and
never
leaving
off
till
twelve
at
night
and
died
of
the
exhaustion
which
would
be
a
Jubilee
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
Miss
Nipper
preceded
her
foe
out
of
the
room
;
and
walking
upstairs
to
her
own
apartments
in
great
state
,
to
the
choking
exasperation
of
the
ireful
Pipchin
,
sat
down
among
her
boxes
and
began
to
cry
.
  
<EOS>
From
this
soft
mood
she
was
soon
aroused
,
with
a
very
wholesome
and
refreshing
effect
,
by
the
voice
of
Mrs
Pipchin
outside
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
that
bold
-
faced
slut
,
"
said
the
fell
Pipchin
,
"
intend
to
take
her
warning
,
or
does
she
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Nipper
replied
from
within
that
the
person
described
did
not
inhabit
that
part
of
the
house
,
but
that
her
name
was
Pipchin
,
and
she
was
to
be
found
in
the
housekeeper
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
saucy
baggage
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Mrs
Pipchin
,
rattling
at
the
handle
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
Go
along
with
you
this
minute
.
<EOS>
Pack
up
your
things
directly
!
<EOS>
How
dare
you
talk
in
this
way
to
a
gentlewoman
who
has
seen
better
days
?
"
   
<EOS>
To
which
Miss
Nipper
rejoined
from
her
castle
,
that
she
pitied
the
better
days
that
had
seen
Mrs
Pipchin
;
and
that
for
her
part
she
considered
the
worst
days
in
the
year
to
be
about
that
lady
's
mark
,
except
that
they
were
much
too
good
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
need
n't
trouble
yourself
to
make
a
noise
at
my
door
,
"
said
Susan
Nipper
,
"
nor
to
contaminate
the
key
-
hole
with
your
eye
,
I
'm
packing
up
and
going
you
may
take
your
affidavit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
Dowager
expressed
her
lively
satisfaction
at
this
intelligence
,
and
with
some
general
opinions
upon
young
hussies
as
a
race
,
and
especially
upon
their
demerits
after
being
spoiled
by
Miss
Dombey
,
withdrew
to
prepare
the
Nipper
's
wages
.
<EOS>
Susan
then
bestirred
herself
to
get
her
trunks
in
order
,
that
she
might
take
an
immediate
and
dignified
departure
;
sobbing
heartily
all
the
time
,
as
she
thought
of
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
The
object
of
her
regret
was
not
long
in
coming
to
her
,
for
the
news
soon
spread
over
the
house
that
Susan
Nipper
had
had
a
disturbance
with
Mrs
Pipchin
,
and
that
they
had
both
appealed
to
Mr
Dombey
,
and
that
there
had
been
an
unprecedented
piece
of
work
in
Mr
Dombey
's
room
,
and
that
Susan
was
going
.
<EOS>
The
latter
part
of
this
confused
rumour
,
Florence
found
to
be
so
correct
,
that
Susan
had
locked
the
last
trunk
and
was
sitting
upon
it
with
her
bonnet
on
,
when
she
came
into
her
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Susan
!
"
cried
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
Going
to
leave
me
!
<EOS>
You
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
for
goodness
gracious
sake
,
Miss
Floy
,
"
said
Susan
,
sobbing
,
"
do
n't
speak
a
word
to
me

I
shall
demean
myself
before
them

Pi

<EOS>
"
Susan

said
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
My

<EOS>
What
shall
I

Can

"
No

sobbed
Susan
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
ca
n't
be
helped
,
I
've
done
my
duty
Miss

I
have
indeed

<EOS>
It
's
no
fault

mine

<EOS>
I
am
quite
resi

igned

<EOS>
I
could
n't
stay
my
month
<EOS>
or
I
could
never
leave
you
then
my
darling
<EOS>
and
I
must
<EOS>
at
last
as
well
as
at
first
<EOS>
,
do
n't
speak
to
me
Miss
Floy
,
<EOS>
for
though
I
'm
pretty
firm
<EOS>
I
'm
not
a
marble
doorpost
,
my
own
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
<EOS>
Why
is
it
?
"
said
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
tell
me
?
"
<EOS>
For
Susan
was
shaking
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
-
n
-
no
,
my
darling
,
"
returned
Susan
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
ask
me
,
for
I
must
n't
,
and
whatever
you
do
do
n't
put
in
a
word
for
me
to
stop
,
<EOS>
for
it
could
n't
be
and
<EOS>
you
'd
only
wrong
yourself
,
and
so
God
bless
you
my
own
precious
and
forgive
me
any
harm
I
have
done
,
or
any
temper
I
have
showed
in
all
these
many
years
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
which
entreaty
,
very
heartily
delivered
,
Susan
hugged
her
mistress
in
her
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
darling
there
's
a
many
that
may
come
to
serve
you
and
be
glad
to
serve
you
and
who
'll
serve
you
well
and
true
,
"
said
Susan
,
"
but
there
ca
n't
be
one
who
'll
serve
you
<EOS>
so
affectionate
as
me
or
love
you
half
as
dearly
<EOS>
,
that
's
my
comfort
.
<EOS>
Go
-
oodbye
,
sweet
Miss
Floy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
will
you
go
,
Susan
?
"
asked
her
weeping
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
a
brother
down
in
the
country
Miss
---
a
farmer
in
Essex
,
"
said
the
heart
-
broken
Nipper
,
"
that
keeps
ever
so
many
co
-
o
-
ows
and
pigs
<EOS>
and
I
shall
go
down
there
by
the
coach
and
sto
-
op
with
him
,
and
do
n't
mind
me
,
for
I
've
got
money
in
the
Savings
'
Banks
<EOS>
my
dear
,
and
need
n't
take
another
service
just
yet
,
which
I
could
n't
,
could
n't
,
could
n't
do
,
my
heart
's
own
mistress
!
"
<EOS>
Susan
finished
with
a
burst
of
sorrow
,
which
was
opportunely
broken
by
the
voice
of
Mrs
Pipchin
talking
down
stairs
;
on
hearing
which
,
she
dried
her
red
and
swollen
eyes
,
and
made
a
melancholy
feint
of
calling
jauntily
to
Mr
Towlinson
to
fetch
a
cab
and
carry
down
her
boxes
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
,
pale
and
hurried
and
distressed
,
but
withheld
from
useless
interference
even
here
,
by
her
dread
of
causing
any
new
division
between
her
father
and
his
wife
(
whose
stern
,
indignant
face
had
been
a
warning
to
her
a
few
moments
since
)
,
and
by
her
apprehension
of
being
in
some
way
unconsciously
connected
already
with
the
dismissal
of
her
old
servant
and
friend
,
followed
,
weeping
,
down
stairs
to
Edith
's
dressingroom
,
whither
Susan
betook
herself
to
make
her
parting
curtsey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
here
's
the
cab
,
and
here
's
the
boxes
,
get
along
with
you
,
do
!
"
said
Mrs
Pipchin
,
presenting
herself
at
the
same
moment
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
ma'am
,
but
Mr
Dombey
's
orders
are
imperative
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
,
sitting
under
the
hands
of
her
maid
<EOS>
---
she
was
going
out
to
dinner
---
preserved
her
haughty
face
,
and
took
not
the
least
notice
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
your
money
,
"
said
Mrs
Pipchin
,
who
in
pursuance
of
her
system
,
and
in
recollection
of
the
mines
,
was
accustomed
to
rout
the
servants
about
,
as
she
had
routed
her
young
Brighton
boarders
;
to
the
everlasting
acidulation
of
Master
Bitherstone
,
"
and
the
sooner
this
house
sees
your
back
the
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Susan
had
no
spirits
even
for
the
look
that
belonged
to
Mrs
Pipchin
by
right
;
so
she
dropped
her
curtsey
to
Mrs
Dombey
(
who
inclined
her
head
without
one
word
,
and
whose
eye
avoided
every
one
but
Florence
)
,
and
gave
one
last
parting
hug
to
her
young
mistress
,
and
received
her
parting
embrace
in
return
.
<EOS>
Poor
Susan
's
face
at
this
crisis
,
in
the
intensity
of
her
feelings
and
the
determined
suffocation
of
her
sobs
,
lest
one
should
become
audible
and
be
a
triumph
to
Mrs
Pipchin
,
presented
a
series
of
the
most
extraordinary
physiognomical
phenomena
ever
witnessed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Miss
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
said
Towlinson
,
outside
the
door
with
the
boxes
,
addressing
Florence
,
"
but
Mr
Toots
is
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
sends
his
compliments
,
and
begs
to
know
how
Diogenes
and
Master
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Quick
as
thought
,
Florence
glided
out
and
hastened
down
stairs
,
where
Mr
Toots
,
in
the
most
splendid
vestments
,
was
breathing
very
hard
with
doubt
and
agitation
on
the
subject
of
her
coming
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
de
do
,
Miss
Dombey
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
God
bless
my
soul
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
last
ejaculation
was
occasioned
by
Mr
Toots
's
deep
concern
at
the
distress
he
saw
in
Florence
's
face
;
which
caused
him
to
stop
short
in
a
fit
of
chuckles
,
and
become
an
image
of
despair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Mr
Toots
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
you
are
so
friendly
to
me
,
and
so
honest
,
that
I
am
sure
I
may
ask
a
favour
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dombey
,
"
returned
Mr
Toots
,
"
if
you
'll
only
name
one
,
<EOS>
you
'll
---
you
'll
give
me
an
appetite
.
<EOS>
To
which
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
with
some
sentiment
,
"
I
have
long
been
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Susan
,
who
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
,
the
oldest
friend
I
have
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
is
about
to
leave
here
suddenly
,
and
quite
alone
,
poor
girl
.
<EOS>
She
is
going
home
,
a
little
way
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
Might
I
ask
you
to
take
care
of
her
until
she
is
in
the
coach
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Miss
Dombey
,
"
returned
Mr
Toots
,
"
you
really
do
me
an
honour
and
a
kindness
.
<EOS>
This
proof
of
your
confidence
,
after
the
manner
in
which
I
was
Beast
enough
to
conduct
myself
at
Brighton
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
"
said
Florence
,
hurriedly
---
<EOS>
"
no
---
do
n't
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
Then
would
you
have
the
kindness
to
---
to
go
?
<EOS>
and
to
be
ready
to
meet
her
when
she
comes
out
?
<EOS>
Thank
you
<EOS>
a
thousand
times!You
ease
my
mind
so
much
.
<EOS>
She
does
n't
seem
so
desolate
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
think
how
grateful
I
feel
to
you
,
or
what
a
good
friend
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
are
!
"
<EOS>
And
Florence
in
her
earnestness
thanked
him
again
and
again
;
and
Mr
Toots
,
in
his
earnestness
,
hurried
away
---
but
backwards
,
that
he
might
lose
no
glimpse
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
had
not
the
courage
to
go
out
,
when
she
saw
poor
Susan
in
the
hall
,
with
Mrs
Pipchin
driving
her
forth
,
and
Diogenes
jumping
about
her
,
and
terrifying
Mrs
Pipchin
to
the
last
degree
by
making
snaps
at
her
bombazeen
skirts
,
and
howling
with
anguish
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
---
for
the
good
duenna
was
the
dearest
and
most
cherished
aversion
of
his
breast
.
<EOS>
But
she
saw
Susan
shake
hands
with
the
servants
all
round
,
and
turn
once
to
look
at
her
old
home
;
and
she
saw
Diogenes
bound
out
after
the
cab
,
and
want
to
follow
it
,
and
testify
an
impossibility
of
conviction
that
he
had
no
longer
any
property
in
the
fare
;
and
the
door
was
shut
,
and
the
hurry
over
,
and
her
tears
flowed
fast
for
the
loss
of
an
old
friend
,
whom
no
one
could
replace
.
<EOS>
No
one
.
<EOS>
No
one
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
like
the
leal
and
trusty
soul
<EOS>
he
was
,
stopped
the
cabriolet
in
a
twinkling
,
and
told
Susan
Nipper
of
his
commission
,
at
which
she
cried
more
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
soul
and
body
!
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
taking
his
seat
beside
her
,
"
I
feel
for
you
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
and
honour
I
think
you
can
hardly
know
your
own
feelings
better
than
I
imagine
them
.
<EOS>
I
can
conceive
nothing
more
dreadful
than
to
have
to
leave
Miss
Dombey
.
"
  
<EOS>
Susan
abandoned
herself
to
her
grief
now
,
and
it
really
was
touching
to
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
now
,
do
n't
!
<EOS>
at
least
I
mean
now
do
,
you
know
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
what
,
Mr
Toots
?
"
cried
Susan
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
come
home
to
my
place
,
and
have
some
dinner
before
you
start
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
My
cook
's
a
most
respectable
woman
---
one
of
the
most
motherly
people
I
ever
saw
---
and
she
'll
be
delighted
to
make
you
comfortable
.
<EOS>
Her
son
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
as
an
additional
recommendation
,
"
was
educated
in
the
Blue
-
coat
School
,
and
blown
up
in
a
powder
-
mill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Susan
accepting
this
kind
offer
,
Mr
Toots
conducted
her
to
his
dwelling
,
where
they
were
received
by
the
Matron
in
question
who
fully
justified
his
character
of
her
,
and
by
the
Chicken
,
who
at
first
supposed
,
on
seeing
a
lady
in
the
vehicle
,
that
Mr
Dombey
had
been
doubled
up
,
agreeably
to
his
old
recommendation
,
and
Miss
Dombey
abducted
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
awakened
in
Miss
Nipper
some
considerable
astonishment
;
for
,
having
been
defeated
by
the
Larkey
Boy
,
his
visage
was
in
a
state
of
such
great
dilapidation
,
as
to
be
hardly
presentable
in
society
with
comfort
to
the
beholders
.
<EOS>
The
Chicken
himself
attributed
this
punishment
to
his
having
had
the
misfortune
to
get
into
Chancery
early
in
the
proceedings
,
when
he
was
severely
fibbed
by
the
Larkey
one
,
and
heavily
grassed
.
<EOS>
But
it
appeared
from
the
published
records
of
that
great
contest
that
the
Larkey
Boy
had
had
it
all
his
own
way
from
the
beginning
,
and
that
the
Chicken
had
been
tapped
,
and
bunged
,
and
had
received
pepper
,
and
had
been
made
groggy
,
and
had
come
up
piping
,
and
had
endured
a
complication
of
similar
strange
inconveniences
,
until
he
had
been
gone
into
and
finished
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
good
repast
,
and
much
hospitality
,
Susan
set
out
for
the
coach
-
office
in
another
cabriolet
,
with
Mr
Toots
inside
,
as
before
,
and
the
Chicken
on
the
box
,
who
,
whatever
distinction
he
conferred
on
the
little
party
by
the
moral
weight
and
heroism
of
his
character
,
was
scarcely
ornamental
to
it
,
physically
speaking
,
on
account
of
his
plasters
;
which
were
numerous
.
<EOS>
But
the
Chicken
had
registered
a
vow
,
in
secret
,
that
he
would
never
leave
Mr
Toots
(
who
was
secretly
pining
to
get
rid
of
him
)
,
for
any
less
consideration
than
the
good
-
will
and
fixtures
of
a
public
-
house
;
and
being
ambitious
to
go
into
that
line
,
and
drink
himself
to
death
as
soon
as
possible
,
he
felt
it
his
cue
to
make
his
company
unacceptable
.
   
<EOS>
The
night
-
coach
by
which
Susan
was
to
go
,
was
on
the
point
of
departure
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
having
put
per
inside
,
lingered
by
the
window
,
irresolutely
,
until
the
driver
was
about
to
mount
;
when
,
standing
on
the
step
,
and
putting
in
a
face
that
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
was
anxious
and
confused
,
he
said
abruptly
:
  
"
I
say
,
Susan
!
<EOS>
Miss
Dombey
,
you
know
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
she
could
---
you
know
---
eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr
Toots
,
"
said
Susan
,
"
but
<EOS>
I
do
n't
hear
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
she
could
be
brought
,
you
know
---
not
exactly
at
once
,
but
in
time
---
in
a
long
time
---
to
---
to
love
me
,
you
know
?
<EOS>
There
!
"
said
poor
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
no
!
"
returned
Susan
,
shaking
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
,
never
.
<EOS>
Ne
---
ver
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
!
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
of
no
consequence
.
<EOS>
Good
night
.
<EOS>
It
's
of
no
consequence

thank'ee

<EOS>
The
Trusty
Agent
 
EDITH
went
out
alone
that
day
,
and
returned
home
early
.
<EOS>
It
was
but
a
few
minutes
after
ten
o'clock
,
when
her
carriage
rolled
along
the
street
in
which
she
lived
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
the
same
enforced
composure
on
her
face
,
that
there
had
been
when
she
was
dressing
;
and
the
wreath
upon
her
head
encircled
the
same
cold
and
steady
brow
.
<EOS>
But
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
seen
its
leaves
and
flowers
reft
into
fragments
by
her
passionate
hand
,
or
rendered
shapeless
by
the
fitful
searches
of
a
throbbing
and
bewildered
brain
for
any
resting
-
place
,
than
adorning
such
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
So
obdurate
,
so
unapproachable
,
so
unrelenting
,
one
would
have
thought
that
nothing
could
soften
such
a
woman
's
nature
,
and
that
everything
in
life
had
hardened
it
.
  
<EOS>
Arrived
at
her
own
door
,
she
was
alighting
,
when
some
one
coming
quietly
from
the
hall
,
and
standing
bareheaded
,
offered
her
his
arm
.
<EOS>
The
servant
being
thrust
aside
,
she
had
no
choice
but
to
touch
it
;
and
she
then
knew
whose
arm
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
your
patient
,
Sir
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
with
a
curled
lip
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
better
,
"
returned
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
doing
very
well
.
<EOS>
I
have
left
him
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
bent
her
head
,
and
was
passing
up
the
staircase
,
when
he
followed
and
said
,
speaking
at
the
bottom
:
  
"
Madam
!
<EOS>
May
I
beg
the
favour
of
a
minute
's
audience
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
stopped
and
turned
her
eyes
back
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
an
unreasonable
time
,
Sir
,
and
I
am
fatigued
.
<EOS>
Is
your
business
urgent
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
urgent
,
"
returned
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
As
I
am
so
fortunate
as
to
have
met
you
,
let
me
press
my
petition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
down
for
a
moment
at
his
glistening
mouth
;
and
he
looked
up
at
her
,
standing
above
him
in
her
stately
dress
,
and
thought
,
again
,
how
beautiful
she
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Miss
Dombey
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
the
servant
,
aloud
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
morning
room
,
Ma'am
.
"
  
"
Show
the
way
there
!
"
<EOS>
Turning
her
eyes
again
on
the
attentive
gentleman
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
,
and
informing
him
with
a
slight
motion
of
her
head
,
that
he
was
at
liberty
to
follow
,
she
passed
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
!
<EOS>
Madam
!
<EOS>
Mrs
Dombey
!
"
cried
the
soft
and
nimble
Carker
at
her
side
in
a
moment
.
"
<EOS>
May
I
be
permitted
to
entreat
that
Miss
Dombey
is
not
present
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
confronted
him
,
with
a
quick
look
,
but
with
the
same
self
-
possession
and
steadiness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
spare
Miss
Dombey
,
"
said
Carker
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
the
knowledge
of
what
I
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
At
least
,
Madam
,
I
would
leave
it
to
you
to
decide
whether
she
shall
know
of
it
or
not
.
<EOS>
I
owe
that
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
bounden
duty
to
you
.
<EOS>
After
our
former
interview
,
it
would
be
monstrous
in
me
if
I
did
otherwise
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
slowly
withdrew
her
eyes
from
his
face
,
and
turning
to
the
servant
,
said
,
"
<EOS>
Some
other
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
led
the
way
to
a
drawing
-
room
,
which
he
speedily
lighted
up
and
then
left
them
.
<EOS>
While
he
remained
,
not
a
word
was
spoken
.
<EOS>
Edith
enthroned
herself
upon
a
couch
by
the
fire
;
and
Mr
Carker
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
his
eyes
bent
upon
the
carpet
,
stood
before
her
,
at
some
little
distance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Before
I
hear
you
,
Sir
,
"
said
Edith
,
when
the
door
was
closed
,
"
I
wish
you
to
hear
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
addressed
by
Mrs
Dombey
,
"
he
returned
,
"
even
in
accents
of
unmerited
reproach
,
is
an
honour
I
so
greatly
esteem
,
that
although
I
were
not
her
servant
in
all
things
,
I
should
defer
to
such
a
wish
,
most
readily
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
charged
by
the
man
whom
you
have
just
now
left
,
Sir
;
"
Mr
Carker
raised
his
eyes
,
as
if
he
were
going
to
counterfeit
surprise
,
but
she
met
them
,
and
stopped
him
,
if
such
were
his
intention
;
"
with
any
message
to
me
,
do
not
attempt
to
deliver
it
,
for
I
will
not
receive
it
.
<EOS>
I
need
scarcely
ask
you
if
you
are
come
on
such
an
errand
.
<EOS>
I
have
expected
you
some
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
misfortune
,
"
he
replied
,
"
to
be
here
,
wholly
against
my
will
,
for
such
a
purpose
.
<EOS>
Allow
me
to
say
that
I
am
here
for
two
purposes
.
<EOS>
That
is
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
one
,
Sir
,
"
she
returned
,
"
is
ended
.
<EOS>
Or
,
if
you
return
to
it
"
  
"
Can
Mrs
Dombey
believe
,
"
said
Carker
,
coming
nearer
,
"
that
I
would
return
to
it
in
the
face
of
her
prohibition
?
<EOS>
Is
it
possible
that
Mrs
Dombey
,
having
no
regard
to
my
unfortunate
position
,
is
so
determined
to
consider
me
inseparable
from
my
instructor
as
to
do
me
great
and
wilful
injustice
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
returned
Edith
,
bending
her
dark
gaze
full
upon
him
,
and
speaking
with
a
rising
passion
that
inflated
her
proud
nostril
and
her
swelling
neck
,
and
stirred
the
delicate
white
down
upon
a
robe
she
wore
,
thrown
loosely
over
shoulders
that
could
bear
its
snowy
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
present
yourself
to
me
,
as
you
have
done
,
and
speak
to
me
of
love
and
duty
to
my
husband
,
and
pretend
to
think
that
I
am
happily
married
,
and
that
I
honour
him
?
<EOS>
How
dare
you
venture
so
to
affront
me
,
when
you
know
<EOS>
---
I
do
not
know
better
,
Sir
:
I
have
seen
it
in
your
every
glance
,
and
heard
it
in
your
every
word
---
that
in
place
of
affection
between
us
<EOS>
there
is
aversion
and
contempt
,
and
that
I
despise
him
hardly
less
than
I
despise
myself
for
being
his
!
<EOS>
Injustice
!
<EOS>
If
I
had
done
justice
to
the
torment
you
have
made
me
feel
,
and
to
my
sense
of
the
insult
you
have
put
upon
me
,
I
should
have
slain
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
asked
him
why
he
did
this
.
<EOS>
Had
she
not
been
blinded
by
her
pride
and
wrath
,
and
self
-
humiliation
,
---
which
she
was
,
fiercely
as
she
bent
her
gaze
upon
him
,
---
she
would
have
been
the
answer
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
To
bring
her
to
this
declaration
.
  
<EOS>
She
saw
it
not
,
and
cared
not
whether
it
was
there
or
no
.
<EOS>
She
saw
only
the
indignities
and
struggles
she
had
undergone
,
and
had
to
undergo
,
and
was
writhing
under
them
.
<EOS>
As
she
sat
looking
fixedly
at
them
,
rather
than
at
him
,
she
plucked
the
feathers
from
a
pinion
of
some
rare
and
beautiful
bird
,
which
hung
from
her
wrist
by
a
golden
thread
,
to
serve
her
as
a
fan
,
and
rained
them
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
shrink
beneath
her
gaze
,
but
stood
,
until
such
outward
signs
of
her
anger
as
had
escaped
her
control
subsided
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
his
sufficient
reply
in
reserve
and
would
presently
deliver
it
.
<EOS>
And
he
then
spoke
,
looking
straight
into
her
kindling
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
know
,
and
knew
before
to
-
day
,
that
I
have
found
no
favour
with
you
;
and
I
knew
why
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
knew
why
.
<EOS>
You
have
spoken
so
openly
to
me
;
I
am
so
relieved
by
the
possession
of
your
confidence
"
  
"
Confidence
!
"
<EOS>
she
repeated
,
with
disdain
.
  
<EOS>
He
passed
it
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
that
I
will
make
no
pretence
of
concealment
.
<EOS>
I
did
see
from
the
first
,
that
there
was
no
affection
on
your
part
for
Mr
Dombey
<EOS>
---
how
could
it
possibly
exist
between
such
different
subjects
?
<EOS>
And
I
have
seen
,
since
,
that
stronger
feelings
than
indifference
have
been
engendered
in
your
breast
<EOS>
---
how
could
that
possibly
be
otherwise
,
either
,
circumstanced
as
you
have
been
?
<EOS>
But
was
it
for
me
to
presume
to
avow
this
knowledge
to
you
in
so
many
words
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
for
you
,
Sir
,
"
she
replied
,
"
to
feign
that
other
belief
,
and
audaciously
to
thrust
it
one
<EOS>
me
day
by
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
it
was
,
"
he
eagerly
retorted
.
"
If
I
had
done
less
,
if
I
had
done
anything
but
that
,
I
should
not
be
speaking
to
you
thus
;
and
I
foresaw
---
who
could
better
foresee
,
for
who
has
had
greater
experience
of
Mr
Dombey
than
myself
?
---
that
unless
your
character
should
prove
to
be
as
yielding
and
obedient
as
that
of
his
first
submissive
lady
,
which
I
did
not
believe
"
   
A
haughty
smile
gave
him
reason
to
observe
that
he
might
repeat
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
which
I
did
not
believe
,
---
the
time
was
likely
to
come
,
when
such
an
understanding
as
we
have
now
arrived
at
,
would
be
serviceable
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Serviceable
to
whom
,
Sir
?
"
<EOS>
she
demanded
scornfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
add
to
myself
,
as
warning
me
to
refrain
even
from
that
limited
commendation
of
Mr
Dombey
,
in
which
I
can
honestly
indulge
,
in
order
that
I
may
not
have
the
misfortune
of
saying
anything
distasteful
to
one
whose
aversion
and
contempt
,
"
with
great
expression
,
"
are
so
keen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
honest
in
you
,
Sir
,
"
said
Edith
,
"
to
confess
to
your
"
limited
commendation
,
"
and
to
speak
in
that
tone
of
disparagement
,
even
of
him
:
being
his
chief
counsellor
and
flatterer
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Counsellor
,
---
yes
,
"
said
Carker
.
<EOS>
Flatterer
,
---
no
.
<EOS>
A
little
reservation
<EOS>
I
fear
I
must
confess
to
.
<EOS>
But
our
interest
and
convenience
commonly
oblige
many
of
us
to
make
professions
that
we
can
not
feel
.
<EOS>
We
have
partnerships
of
interest
and
convenience
,
friendships
of
interest
and
convenience
,
dealings
of
interest
and
convenience
,
marriages
of
interest
and
convenience
,
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
bit
her
blood
-
red
lip
;
but
without
wavering
in
the
dark
,
stern
watch
she
kept
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
sitting
down
in
a
chair
that
was
near
her
,
with
an
air
of
the
most
profound
and
most
considerate
respect
,
<EOS>
"
why
should
I
hesitate
now
,
being
altogether
devoted
to
your
service
,
to
speak
plainly
?
<EOS>
It
was
natural
that
a
lady
,
endowed
as
you
are
,
should
think
it
feasible
to
change
her
husband
's
character
in
some
respects
,
and
mould
him
to
a
better
form
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
natural
to
me
,
Sir
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
never
any
expectation
or
intention
of
that
kind
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
proud
undaunted
face
showed
him
it
was
resolute
to
wear
no
mask
he
offered
,
but
was
set
upon
a
reckless
disclosure
of
itself
,
indifferent
to
any
aspect
in
which
it
might
present
itself
to
such
as
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
least
it
was
natural
,
"
he
resumed
,
"
that
you
should
deem
it
quite
possible
to
live
with
Mr
Dombey
as
his
wife
,
at
once
without
submitting
to
him
,
and
without
coming
into
such
violent
collision
with
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
Madam
,
you
did
not
know
Mr
Dombey
(
as
you
have
since
ascertained
)
,
when
you
thought
that
.
<EOS>
You
did
not
know
how
exacting
and
how
proud
he
is
,
or
how
he
is
,
if
I
may
say
so
,
the
slave
of
his
own
greatness
,
and
goes
yoked
to
his
own
triumphal
car
like
a
beast
of
burden
,
with
no
idea
on
earth
<EOS>
but
that
it
is
behind
him
and
is
to
be
drawn
on
,
over
everything
and
through
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
teeth
gleamed
through
his
malicious
relish
of
this
conceit
,
as
he
went
on
talking
:
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dombey
is
really
capable
of
no
more
true
consideration
for
you
,
Madam
,
than
for
me
.
<EOS>
The
comparison
is
an
extreme
one
;
I
intend
it
to
be
so
;
but
quite
just
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
in
the
plenitude
of
his
power
,
asked
me
---
I
had
it
from
his
own
lips
yesterday
morning
---
to
be
his
go
between
to
you
,
because
he
knows
I
am
not
agreeable
to
you
,
and
because
he
intends
that
I
shall
be
a
punishment
for
your
contumacy
;
and
besides
that
,
because
he
really
does
consider
,
that
I
,
his
paid
servant
,
am
an
ambassador
whom
it
is
derogatory
to
the
dignity
---
not
of
the
lady
to
whom
I
have
the
happiness
of
speaking
;
she
has
no
existence
in
his
mind
---
<EOS>
but
of
his
wife
,
a
part
of
himself
,
to
receive
.
<EOS>
You
may
imagine
how
regardless
of
me
,
how
obtuse
to
the
possibility
of
my
having
any
individual
sentiment
or
opinion
he
is
,
when
he
tells
me
,
openly
,
that
I
am
so
employed
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
perfectly
indifferent
to
your
feelings
he
is
,
when
he
threatens
you
with
such
a
messenger
.
<EOS>
As
you
,
of
course
,
have
not
forgotten
that
he
did
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
watched
him
still
attentively
.
<EOS>
But
he
watched
her
too
;
and
he
saw
that
this
indication
of
a
knowledge
on
his
part
,
of
something
that
had
passed
between
herself
and
her
husband
,
rankled
and
smarted
in
her
haughty
breast
,
like
a
poisoned
arrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
recall
all
this
to
widen
the
breach
between
yourself
and
Mr
Dombey
,
Madam
---
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
!
<EOS>
what
would
it
profit
me
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
but
as
an
example
of
the
hopelessness
of
impressing
Mr
Dombey
with
a
sense
that
anybody
is
to
be
considered
when
he
is
in
question
.
<EOS>
We
who
are
about
him
,
have
,
in
our
various
positions
,
done
our
part
,
I
dare
say
,
to
confirm
him
in
his
way
of
thinking
;
but
if
we
had
not
done
so
,
others
would
---
or
they
would
not
have
been
about
him
;
and
it
has
always
been
from
the
beginning
,
the
very
staple
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
has
had
to
deal
,
in
short
,
with
none
but
submissive
and
dependent
persons
,
who
have
bowed
the
knee
,
and
bent
the
neck
,
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
has
never
known
what
it
is
to
have
angry
pride
and
strong
resentment
opposed
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
will
know
it
now
!
<EOS>
"
she
seemed
to
say
;
though
her
lips
did
not
part
,
not
her
eyes
falter
.
<EOS>
He
saw
the
soft
down
tremble
once
again
,
and
he
saw
her
lay
the
plumage
of
the
beautiful
bird
against
her
bosom
for
a
moment
;
and
he
unfolded
one
more
ring
of
the
coil
into
which
he
had
gathered
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dombey
,
though
a
most
honourable
gentleman
,
"
he
said
,
"
is
so
prone
to
pervert
even
facts
to
his
own
view
,
when
he
is
at
all
opposed
,
in
consequence
of
the
warp
in
his
mind
,
that
he
---
can
I
give
a
better
instance
than
this
!
<EOS>
---
he
sincerely
believes
(
you
will
excuse
the
folly
of
what
I
am
about
to
say
;
it
not
being
mine
)
that
his
severe
expression
of
opinion
to
his
present
wife
,
on
a
certain
special
occasion
she
may
remember
,
before
the
lamented
death
of
Mrs
Skewton
,
produced
a
withering
effect
,
and
for
the
moment
quite
subdued
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
laughed
.
<EOS>
How
harshly
and
unmusically
need
not
be
described
.
<EOS>
It
is
enough
that
he
was
glad
to
hear
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
he
resumed
,
"
I
have
done
with
this
.
<EOS>
Your
own
opinions
are
so
strong
,
and
,
I
am
persuaded
,
so
unalterable
,
"
he
repeated
those
words
slowly
and
with
great
emphasis
,
"
that
I
am
almost
afraid
to
incur
your
displeasure
anew
,
when
I
say
that
in
spite
of
these
defects
and
my
full
knowledge
of
them
,
I
have
become
habituated
to
Mr
Dombey
,
and
esteem
him
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
say
so
,
it
is
not
,
believe
me
,
for
the
mere
sake
of
vaunting
a
feeling
that
is
so
utterly
at
variance
with
your
own
,
and
for
which
you
can
have
sympathy
"
---
<EOS>
oh
how
distinct
and
plain
and
emphasized
this
was
!
---
"
but
to
give
you
an
assurance
of
the
zeal
with
which
,
in
this
unhappy
matter
,
I
am
yours
,
and
the
indignation
with
which
I
regard
the
part
I
am
required
to
fill
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
sat
as
if
were
afraid
to
take
her
eyes
from
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
to
unwind
the
last
ring
of
the
coil
!
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
growing
late
,
"
said
Carker
,
after
a
pause
,
"
and
you
are
,
as
you
said
,
fatigued
.
<EOS>
But
the
second
object
of
this
interview
,
I
must
not
forget
.
<EOS>
I
must
recommend
you
,
I
must
entreat
you
in
the
most
earnest
manner
,
for
sufficient
reasons
that
I
have
,
to
be
cautious
in
your
demonstrations
of
regard
for
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cautious
!
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
careful
how
you
exhibit
too
much
affection
for
that
young
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Too
much
affection
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
"
said
Edith
,
knitting
her
broad
brow
and
rising
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
judges
my
affection
,
or
measures
it
out
?
<EOS>
You
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
I
who
do
so
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
,
or
feigned
to
be
,
perplexed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
then
?
"
  
"
Can
you
not
guess
who
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
choose
to
guess
,
"
she
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
he
said
after
a
little
hesitation
;
meantime
they
had
been
,
and
still
were
,
regarding
each
other
as
before
;
"
I
am
in
a
difficulty
here
.
<EOS>
You
have
told
me
you
will
receive
no
message
,
and
you
have
forbidden
me
to
return
to
that
subject
;
but
the
two
subjects
are
so
closely
entwined
,
I
find
,
that
unless
you
will
accept
this
vague
caution
from
one
who
has
now
the
honour
to
possess
your
confidence
,
though
the
way
to
it
has
been
through
your
displeasure
<EOS>
,
I
must
violate
the
injunction
you
have
laid
upon
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
you
are
free
to
do
so
,
Sir
,
"
said
Edith
.
<EOS>
"
Do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
pale
,
so
trembling
so
impassioned
!
<EOS>
He
had
not
miscalculated
the
effect
then
!
  
<EOS>
"
His
instructions
were
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
that
I
should
inform
you
that
your
demeanour
towards
Miss
Dombey
is
not
agreeable
to
him
.
<EOS>
That
it
suggests
comparisons
to
him
which
are
not
favourable
to
himself
.
<EOS>
That
he
desires
it
may
be
wholly
changed
;
and
that
if
you
are
in
earnest
,
he
is
confident
it
will
be
;
for
your
continued
show
of
affection
will
not
benefit
its
object
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
threat
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
threat
,
"
he
answered
,
in
his
voiceless
manner
of
assent
:
adding
aloud
,
"
but
not
directed
against
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Proud
,
erect
,
and
dignified
,
as
she
stood
confronting
him
;
and
looking
through
him
as
she
did
,
with
her
full
bright
flashing
eye
;
and
smiling
,
as
she
was
,
with
scorn
and
bitterness
<EOS>
;
she
sunk
as
if
the
ground
has
dropped
beneath
her
,
and
in
an
instant
would
have
fallen
on
the
floor
,
but
that
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
As
instantaneously
she
threw
him
off
,
the
moment
that
he
touched
her
,
and
,
drawing
back
,
confronted
him
again
,
immoveable
,
with
her
hand
stretched
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Please
to
leave
me
.
<EOS>
Say
no
more
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
the
urgency
of
this
,
"
said
Mr
Carker
,
"
because
it
is
impossible
to
say
what
unforeseen
consequences
might
arise
,
or
how
soon
,
from
your
being
unacquainted
with
his
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
I
understand
Miss
Dombey
is
concerned
,
now
,
at
the
dismissal
of
her
old
servant
,
which
is
likely
to
have
been
a
minor
consequence
in
itself
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
blame
me
for
requesting
that
Miss
Dombey
might
not
be
present
.
<EOS>
May
I
hope
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
Please
to
leave
me
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
knew
that
your
regard
for
the
young
lady
,
which
is
very
sincere
and
strong
,
I
am
well
persuaded
,
would
render
it
a
great
unhappiness
to
you
,
ever
to
be
a
prey
to
the
reflection
that
you
had
injured
her
position
and
ruined
her
future
hopes
,
"
said
Carker
hurriedly
,
but
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
more
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Leave
me
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
here
constantly
in
my
attendance
upon
him
,
and
in
the
transaction
of
business
matters
.
<EOS>
You
will
allow
me
to
see
you
again
and
to
consult
what
should
be
done
,
and
learn
your
wishes
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
motioned
him
towards
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
even
decide
whether
to
tell
him
I
have
spoken
to
you
yet
;
or
to
lead
him
to
suppose
that
I
have
deferred
doing
so
,
for
want
of
opportunity
,
or
for
any
other
reason
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
necessary
that
you
should
enable
me
to
consult
with
you
very
soon
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
time
but
now
,
"
she
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
understand
,
when
I
wish
to
see
you
,
that
Miss
Dombey
is
not
to
be
present
;
and
that
I
seek
an
interview
as
one

has
the
happiness
to
possess
your

and
who
comes
to
render
you
every
assistance
in
his
power
,
and
,
perhaps
,
on
many
occasions
,
to
ward
off
evil
from
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
Looking
at
him
still
with
the
same
apparent
dread
of
releasing
him
for
a
moment
from
the
influence
of
her
steady
gaze
,
whatever
that
might
be
,
she
answered
,
"
Yes
!
"
<EOS>
and
once
more
bade
him
go
.
  
<EOS>
He
bowed
,
as
if
in
compliance
;
but
turning
back
,
when
he
had
nearly
reached
the
door
,
said
:
  
"
I
am
forgiven
,
and
have
explained
my
fault
.
<EOS>
May
I
---
for
Miss
Dombey
's
sake
and
for
my
own
---
take
your
hand
before
I
go
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
gave
him
the
gloved
hand
she
had
maimed
last
night
.
<EOS>
He
took
it
in
one
of
his
,
and
kissed
it
,
and
withdrew
.
<EOS>
And
when
he
had
closed
the
door
,
he
waved
the
hand
with
which
he
had
taken
hers
,
and
thrust
it
in
his
breast
.

Recognizant
and
Reflective
 
AMONG
sundry
minor
alterations
in
Mr
Carker
's
life
and
habits
that
began
to
take
place
at
this
time
,
none
was
more
remarkable
than
the
extraordinary
diligence
with
which
he
applied
himself
to
business
,
and
the
closeness
with
which
he
investigated
every
detail
that
the
affairs
of
the
House
laid
open
to
him
.
<EOS>
Always
active
and
penetrating
in
such
matters
,
his
lynx
-
eyed
vigilance
now
increased
twenty
-
fold
.
<EOS>
Not
only
did
his
weary
watch
keep
pace
with
every
present
point
that
every
day
presented
to
him
in
some
new
form
,
but
in
the
midst
of
these
engrossing
occupations
he
found
leisure
---
that
is
,
he
made
it
---
to
review
the
past
transactions
of
the
Firm
,
and
his
share
in
them
,
during
a
long
series
of
years
.
<EOS>
Frequently
when
the
clerks
were
all
gone
,
the
offices
dark
and
empty
,
and
all
similar
places
of
business
shut
up
,
Mr
Carker
,
with
the
whole
anatomy
of
the
iron
room
laid
bare
before
him
,
would
explore
the
mysteries
of
books
and
papers
,
with
the
patient
progress
of
a
man
who
was
dissecting
the
minutest
nerves
and
fibres
of
his
subject
.
<EOS>
Perch
,
the
messenger
,
who
usually
remained
on
these
occasions
,
to
entertain
himself
with
the
perusal
of
the
Price
Current
by
the
light
of
one
candle
,
or
to
doze
over
the
fire
in
the
outer
office
,
at
the
imminent
risk
every
moment
of
diving
head
foremost
into
the
coal
-
box
,
could
not
withhold
the
tribute
of
his
admiration
from
this
zealous
conduct
,
although
it
much
contracted
his
domestic
enjoyments
;
and
again
,
and
again
,
expatiated
to
Mrs
Perch
(
now
nursing
twins
)
on
the
industry
and
acuteness
of
their
managing
gentleman
in
the
City
.
  
<EOS>
The
same
increased
and
sharp
attention
that
Mr
Carker
bestowed
on
the
business
of
the
House
,
he
applied
to
his
own
personal
affairs
.
<EOS>
Though
not
a
partner
in
the
concern
---
a
distinction
hitherto
reserved
solely
to
inheritors
of
the
great
name
of
Dombey
---
he
was
in
the
receipt
of
some
per
centage
on
its
dealings
;
and
,
participating
in
all
its
facilities
for
the
employment
of
money
to
advantage
,
was
considered
,
by
the
minnows
among
the
tritons
of
the
East
,
a
rich
man
.
<EOS>
It
began
to
be
said
,
among
these
shrewd
observers
,
that
Jem
Carker
,
of
Dombey
's
,
was
looking
about
him
to
see
what
he
was
worth
;
and
that
he
was
calling
in
his
money
at
a
good
time
,
like
the
long
-
headed
fellow
he
was
;
and
bets
were
even
offered
on
the
Stock
Exchange
that
Jem
was
going
to
marry
a
rich
widow
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
these
cares
did
not
in
the
least
interfere
with
Mr
Carker
's
watching
of
his
chief
,
or
with
his
cleanness
,
neatness
,
sleekness
,
or
any
cat
-
like
quality
he
possessed
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
so
much
that
there
was
a
change
in
him
,
in
reference
to
any
of
his
habits
,
as
that
the
whole
man
was
intensified
.
<EOS>
Everything
that
had
been
observable
in
him
before
,
was
observable
now
,
but
with
a
greater
amount
of
concentration
.
<EOS>
He
did
each
single
thing
,
as
if
he
did
nothing
else
---
a
pretty
certain
indication
in
a
man
of
that
range
of
ability
and
purpose
,
that
he
is
doing
something
which
sharpens
and
keeps
alive
his
keenest
powers
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
decided
alteration
in
him
was
,
that
as
he
rode
to
and
fro
along
the
streets
,
he
would
fall
into
deep
fits
of
musing
,
like
that
in
which
he
had
come
away
from
Mr
Dombey
's
house
,
on
the
morning
of
that
gentleman
's
disaster
.
<EOS>
At
such
times
,
he
would
keep
clear
of
the
obstacles
in
his
way
,
mechanically
;
and
would
appear
to
see
and
hear
nothing
until
arrival
at
his
destination
,
or
some
sudden
chance
or
effort
roused
him
.
  
<EOS>
Walking
his
white
-
legged
horse
thus
,
to
the
counting
-
house
of
Dombey
and
Son
one
day
,
he
was
as
unconscious
of
the
observation
of
two
pairs
of
women
's
eyes
,
as
of
the
fascinated
orbs
of
Rob
the
Grinder
,
who
,
in
waiting
a
street
's
length
from
the
appointed
place
,
as
a
demonstration
of
punctuality
,
vainly
touched
and
retouched
his
hat
to
attract
attention
,
and
trotted
along
on
foot
,
by
his
master
's
side
,
prepared
to
hold
his
stirrup
when
he
should
alight
.
  
<EOS>
"
See
where
he
goes
!
"
<EOS>
cried
one
of
these
two
women
,
an
old
creature
,
who
stretched
out
her
shrivelled
arm
to
point
him
out
to
her
companion
,
a
young
woman
,
who
stood
close
beside
her
,
withdrawn
like
herself
into
a
gateway
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Brown
's
daughter
looked
out
,
at
this
bidding
on
the
part
of
Mrs
Brown
;
and
there
were
wrath
and
vengeance
in
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
thought
to
look
at
him
again
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
low
voice
;
"
but
it
's
well
<EOS>
I
should
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
I
see
.
<EOS>
I
see
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
changed
!
"
said
the
old
woman
,
with
a
look
of
eager
malice
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
changed
!
"
returned
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
What
for
?
<EOS>
What
has
he
suffered
?
<EOS>
There
is
change
enough
for
twenty
in
me
.
<EOS>
Is
n't
that
enough
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
See
where
he
goes
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
the
old
woman
,
watching
her
daughter
with
her
red
eyes
;
"
so
easy
and
so
trim
,
a
-
horseback
,
while
we
are
in
the
mud
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
of
it
,
"
said
her
daughter
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
mud
,
underneath
his
horse
's
feet
.
<EOS>
What
should
we
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
intentness
with
which
she
looked
after
him
again
,
she
made
a
hasty
gesture
with
her
hand
when
the
old
woman
began
to
reply
,
as
if
her
view
could
be
obstructed
by
mere
sound
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
watching
her
,
and
not
him
,
remained
silent
;
until
her
kindling
glance
subsided
,
and
she
drew
a
long
breath
,
as
if
in
the
relief
of
his
being
gone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Deary
!
"
said
the
old
woman
then
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
!
<EOS>
Handsome
gal!Ally
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
gently
shook
her
sleeve
to
arouse
her
attention
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will
you
let
him
go
like
that
,
when
you
can
wring
money
from
him
?
<EOS>
Why
,
it
's
a
wickedness
,
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
n't
I
told
you
,
that
,
I
will
not
have
money
from
him
?
"
she
returned
.
"
<EOS>
And
do
n't
you
yet
believe
me
?
<EOS>
Did
I
take
his
sister
's
money
?
<EOS>
Would
I
touch
a
penny
,
if
I
knew
it
,
that
had
gone
through
his
white
hands
---
unless
it
was
,
indeed
,
that
I
could
poison
it
,
and
send
it
back
to
him
?
<EOS>
Peace
,
mother
,
and
come
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
him
so
rich
?
<EOS>
"
murmured
the
old
woman
.
"
<EOS>
And
us
so
poor
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
in
not
being
able
to
pay
him
any
of
the
harm
we
owe
him
,
"
returned
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
Let
him
give
me
that
sort
of
riches
,
and
I
'll
take
them
from
him
,
and
use
them
.
<EOS>
Come
away
.
<EOS>
It
's
no
good
looking
at
his
horse
.
<EOS>
Come
away
,
mother
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
old
woman
,
for
whom
the
spectacle
of
Rob
the
Grinder
returning
down
the
street
,
leading
the
riderless
horse
,
appeared
to
have
some
extraneous
interest
that
it
did
not
possess
in
itself
,
surveyed
that
young
man
with
the
utmost
earnestness
;
and
seeming
to
have
whatever
doubts
she
entertained
,
resolved
as
he
drew
nearer
,
glanced
at
her
daughter
with
brightened
eyes
and
with
her
finger
on
her
lip
,
and
emerging
from
the
gateway
at
the
moment
of
his
passing
,
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
where
's
my
sprightly
<EOS>
Rob
been
,
all
this
time
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
as
he
turned
round
.
  
<EOS>
The
sprightly
Rob
,
whose
sprightliness
was
very
much
diminished
by
the
salutation
,
looked
exceedingly
dismayed
,
and
said
,
with
the
water
rising
in
his
eyes
:
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
why
ca
n't
you
leave
a
poor
cove
alone
,
Misses
Brown
,
when
he
's
getting
an
honest
livelihood
and
conducting
himself
respectable
?
<EOS>
What
do
you
come
and
deprive
a
cove
of
his
character
for
,
by
talking
to
him
in
the
streets
,
when
he
's
taking
his
master
's
horse
to
a
honest
stable
---
a
horse
you
'd
go
and
sell
for
cats
'
and
dogs
'
meat
if
you
had
your
way
!
<EOS>
Why
,
I
thought
,
"
said
the
Grinder
,
producing
his
concluding
remark
as
if
it
were
the
climax
of
all
his
injuries
,
"
that
you
was
dead
long
ago
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
way
,
"
cried
the
old
woman
,
appealing
to
her
daughter
,
"
that
he
talks
to
me
,
who
knew
him
weeks
and
months
together
,
my
deary
,
and
have
stood
his
friend
many
and
many
a
time
among
the
pigeon
-
fancying
tramps
and
birdcatchers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
the
birds
be
,
will
you
,
Misses
Brown
?
"
retorted
Rob
,
in
a
tone
of
the
acutest
anguish
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
a
cove
had
better
have
to
do
with
lions
than
them
little
creeturs
,
for
they
're
always
flying
back
in
your
face
<EOS>
when
you
least
except
it
.
<EOS>
Well
,
how
d'ye
do
and
what
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
These
polite
inquiries
the
Grinder
uttered
,
as
it
were
under
protest
,
and
with
great
exasperation
and
vindictiveness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hark
how
he
speaks
to
an
old
friend
,
my
deary
!
"
said
Mrs
Brown
,
again
appealing
to
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
But
there
's
some
of
his
old
friends
no
so
patient
as
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
was
to
tell
some
that
he
knows
,
and
has
sported
and
cheated
with
,
where
to
find
him
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
hold
your
tongue
,
Misses
Brown
?
"
<EOS>
interrupted
the
miserable
Grinder
,
glancing
quickly
round
,
as
though
he
excepted
to
see
his
master
's
teeth
shining
at
his
elbow
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
take
a
pleasure
in
ruining
a
cove
for
?
<EOS>
At
your
time
of
life
too
!
<EOS>
when
you
ought
to
be
thinking
of
a
variety
of
things
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
gallant
hours
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
old
woman
,
patting
the
animal
's
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
him
alone
,
will
you
,
Misses
Brown
?
"
cried
Rob
,
pushing
away
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
enough
to
drive
a
penitent
cove
mad
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
hurt
do
I
do
him
,
child
?
"
returned
the
old
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hurt
?
"
said
Rob
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
got
a
master
that
would
find
it
out
if
he
was
touched
with
a
straw
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
blew
upon
the
place
where
the
old
woman
's
hand
had
rested
for
a
moment
,
and
smoothed
it
gently
with
his
finger
,
as
if
he
seriously
believed
what
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
looking
back
to
mumble
and
mouth
at
her
daughter
,
who
followed
,
kept
close
to
Rob
's
heels
as
he
walked
on
with
the
bridle
in
his
hand
;
and
pursued
the
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
good
place
,
Rob
,
eh
?
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
luck
,
my
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
do
n't
talk
about
luck
,
Misses
Brown
,
"
returned
the
wretched
Grinder
,
facing
round
and
stopping
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
'd
never
come
,
or
if
you
'd
go
away
,
then
indeed
a
cove
might
be
considered
tolerably
lucky
.
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
go
along
,
Misses
Brown
,
and
not
foller
me
!
"
<EOS>
blubbered
Rob
,
with
sudden
defiance
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
young
woman
's
a
friend
of
yours
,
why
do
n't
she
take
you
away
,
instead
of
letting
you
make
yourself
so
disgraceful
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
croaked
the
old
woman
,
putting
her
face
close
to
his
,
with
a
malevolent
grin
upon
it
that
puckered
up
the
loose
skin
down
in
her
very
throat
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
deny
your
old
chum!Have
you
lurked
to
my
house
fifty
times
,
and
slept
sound
in
a
corner
when
you
had
no
other
bed
but
the
paving
-
stones
,
and
do
you
talk
to
me
like
this
!
<EOS>
Have
I
bought
and
sold
with
you
,
and
helped
you
in
my
way
of
business
,
schoolboy
,
sneak
,
and
what
not
,
and
do
you
tell
me
to
go
along
!
<EOS>
Could
I
raise
a
crowd
of
old
company
about
you
to
-
morrow
morning
,
that
would
follow
you
to
ruin
like
copies
of
your
own
shadow
,
and
do
you
turn
on
me
with
your
bold
looks
!
<EOS>
I
'll
go
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
,
Misses
Brown
!
"
cried
the
distracted
Grinder
.
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
doing
of
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
put
yourself
in
a
passion
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
her
go
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
meant
any
offence
.
<EOS>
I
said
"
how
d'ye
do
,
"
at
first
,
did
n't
I
?
<EOS>
But
you
would
n't
answer
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
Besides
,
"
said
Rob
piteously
,
"
look
here!How
<EOS>
can
a
cove
stand
talking
in
the
street
with
his
master
's
prad
<EOS>
a
wanting
to
be
took
to
be
rubbed
down
,
and
his
master
up
to
every
individgle
thing
that
happens
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
made
a
show
of
being
partially
appeased
,
but
shook
her
head
,
and
mouthed
and
muttered
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
along
to
the
stables
,
and
have
a
glass
of
something
that
's
good
for
you
,
Misses
Brown
,
ca
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
said
Rob
,
"
instead
of
going
on
,
like
that
,
which
is
no
good
to
you
,
nor
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
Come
along
with
her
,
will
you
be
so
kind
?
"
said
Rob
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
delighted
to
see
her
,
if
it
was
n't
for
the
horse
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
apology
,
Rob
turned
away
,
a
rueful
picture
of
despair
,
and
walked
his
charge
down
a
bye
street
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
,
mouthing
at
her
daughter
,
followed
close
upon
him
.
<EOS>
The
daughter
followed
.
  
<EOS>
Turning
into
a
silent
little
square
of
court
-
yard
that
had
a
great
church
tower
rising
above
it
,
and
a
packer
's
warehouse
,
and
a
bottle
-
maker
's
warehouse
,
for
its
place
of
business
,
Rob
the
Grinder
delivered
the
white
-
legged
horse
to
the
hostler
of
a
quaint
stable
at
the
corner
;
and
inviting
Mrs
Brown
and
her
daughter
to
seat
themselves
upon
a
stone
bench
at
the
gate
of
that
establishment
,
soon
reappeared
from
a
neighbouring
public
-
house
with
a
pewter
measure
and
a
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
master
---
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
,
child
!
"
said
the
old
woman
,
slowly
,
as
her
sentiment
before
drinking
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
bless
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
did
n't
tell
you
who
he
was
?
"
<EOS>
observed
Rob
,
with
staring
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
know
him
by
slight
,
"
said
Mrs
Brown
,
whose
working
mouth
and
nodding
head
stopped
for
the
moment
,
in
the
fixedness
of
her
attention
.
<EOS>
"
We
saw
him
pass
this
morning
,
afore
he
got
off
his
horse
;
when
you
were
ready
to
take
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
returned
Rob
,
appearing
to
wish
that
his
readiness
had
carried
him
to
any
other
place
.
<EOS>
---
"
What
's
the
matter
with
her
?
<EOS>
Wo
n't
she
drink
?
"
  
<EOS>
This
inquiry
had
reference
to
Alice
,
who
,
folded
in
her
cloak
,
sat
a
little
apart
profoundly
inattentive
to
his
offer
of
the
replenished
glass
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mind
her
,
"
she
said
;
"
she
's
a
strange
creetur
,
if
you
<EOS>
know'd
her
,
Rob
.
<EOS>
But
Mr
Carker
---
"
  
"
Hush
!
"
said
Rob
,
glancing
cautiously
up
at
the
packer
's
,
and
at
the
bottle
-
maker
's
,
as
if
,
from
any
one
of
the
tiers
of
warehouses
,
Mr
Carker
might
be
looking
down
.
"
<EOS>
Softly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
he
ai
n't
here
!
"
cried
Mrs
Brown
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
,
"
muttered
Rob
,
whose
glance
even
wandered
to
the
church
tower
,
as
if
he
might
be
there
,
with
a
supernatural
power
of
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
master
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Mrs
Brown
.
  
<EOS>
Rod
nodded
;
and
added
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
precious
sharp
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lives
out
of
town
,
do
n't
he
,
lovey
?
"
said
the
old
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
he
's
at
home
,
"
returned
Rob
;
"
but
we
do
n't
live
at
home
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
then
?
"
asked
the
old
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lodgings
;
up
near
Mr
Dombey
's
"
returned
Rob
.
  
<EOS>
The
younger
woman
fixed
her
eyes
so
searchingly
upon
him
,
and
so
suddenly
,
that
Rob
was
quite
confounded
,
and
offered
the
glass
again
,
but
with
no
more
effect
upon
her
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dombey
---
you
and
I
used
to
talk
about
him
,
sometimes
,
you
know
,
"
said
Rob
to
Mrs
Brown
.
<EOS>
"
You
used
to
get
me
to
talk
about
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
nodded
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr
Dombey
,
he
's
had
a
fall
from
his
horse
,
"
said
Rob
,
unwillingly
;
"
and
my
master
has
to
be
up
there
,
more
than
usual
,
either
with
him
,
or
Mrs
Dombey
,
or
some
of
'em
;
and
so
we
've
come
to
town
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
they
good
friends
,
lovey
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
old
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
retorted
Rob
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
and
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Dombey
?
"
said
Rob
.
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
know
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
them
---
Master
and
Mrs
Dombey
,
chick
,
"
replied
the
old
woman
,
coaxingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Rob
,
looking
round
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
How
curious
you
are
,
Misses
Brown
!
<EOS>
Least
said
,
soonest
mended
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
there
's
no
harm
in
it
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
old
woman
,
with
a
laugh
,
and
a
clap
of
her
hands
.
"
<EOS>
Sprightly
Rob
has
grown
tame
since
he
has
been
well
off
!
<EOS>
There
's
no
harm
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
there
's
no
harm
in
it
<EOS>
,
I
know
,
"
returned
Rob
,
with
the
same
distrustful
glance
at
the
packer
's
and
the
bottle
-
maker
's
,
and
the
church
;
"
but
blabbing
,
if
it
's
only
about
the
number
of
buttons
on
my
master
's
coat
,
wo
n't
do
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
it
wo
n't
do
with
him
.
<EOS>
A
cove
had
better
drown
himself
.
<EOS>
He
says
so
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
have
so
much
as
told
you
what
his
name
was
,
if
you
had
n't
known
it
.
<EOS>
Talk
about
somebody
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
Rob
took
another
cautious
survey
of
the
yard
,
the
old
woman
made
a
secret
motion
to
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
It
was
momentary
,
but
the
daughter
,
with
a
slight
look
of
intelligence
,
withdrew
her
eyes
from
the
boy
's
face
,
and
sat
folded
in
her
cloak
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rob
,
lovey
!
"
said
the
old
woman
,
beckoning
him
to
the
other
end
of
the
bench
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
always
a
pet
and
favourite
of
mine
.
<EOS>
Now
,
were
n't
you
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
you
were
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Misses
Brown
,
"
replied
the
Grinder
,
with
a
very
bad
grace
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
could
leave
me
!
"
said
the
old
woman
,
flinging
her
arms
about
his
neck
.
<EOS>
"
You
could
go
away
,
and
grow
almost
out
of
knowledge
,
and
never
come
to
tell
your
poor
old
friend
how
fortunate
you
were
,
proud
lad
!
<EOS>
Oho
,
Oho
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
here
's
a
dreadful
go
for
a
cove
that
's
got
a
master
wide
awake
in
the
neighbourhood
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
wretched
Grinder
.
<EOS>
"
To
be
howled
over
like
this
here
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
come
and
see
me
,
Robby
?
"
cried
Mrs
Brown
.
<EOS>
"
Oho
,
wo
n't
you
ever
come
and
see
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
tell
you
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
will
!
"
returned
the
Grinder
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
my
own
Rob
!
<EOS>
That
's
my
lovey
!
"
said
Mrs
Brown
,
drying
the
tears
upon
her
shrivelled
face
,
and
giving
him
a
tender
squeeze
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
the
old
place
,
Rob
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
the
Grinder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Soon
,
Robby
dear
?
"
cried
Mrs
Brown
;
"
and
often
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
replied
Rob
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
indeed
,
upon
my
soul
and
body
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
then
,
"
said
Mrs
Brown
,
with
her
arms
uplifted
towards
the
sky
,
and
her
head
thrown
back
and
shaking
,
"
if
he
's
true
to
his
word
,
I
'll
never
come
a
-
near
him
,
though
I
know
where
he
is
,
and
never
breathe
a
syllable
about
him
!
<EOS>
Never
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
ejaculation
seemed
a
drop
of
comfort
to
the
miserable
Grinder
,
who
shook
Mrs
Brown
by
the
hand
upon
it
,
and
implored
her
with
tears
in
his
eyes
to
leave
a
cove
and
not
destroy
his
prospects
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Brown
,
with
another
fond
embrace
,
assented
;
but
in
the
act
of
following
her
daughter
,
turned
back
,
with
her
finger
stealthily
raised
,
and
asked
in
a
hoarse
whisper
for
some
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
shilling
,
dear
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
with
her
eager
avaricious
face
,
"
or
sixpence
!
"
<EOS>
For
old
acquaintance
sake
.
<EOS>
I
'm
so
poor
.
<EOS>
And
my
handsome
gal
"
---
looking
over
her
shoulder
<EOS>
---
"
she
's
my
gal
,
Rob
---
half
starves
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
as
the
reluctant
Grinder
put
it
in
her
hand
,
her
daughter
,
coming
quietly
back
,
caught
the
hand
in
hers
,
and
twisted
out
the
coin
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
"
she
said
,
"
mother
!
<EOS>
always
money
!
<EOS>
money
from
the
first
,
and
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
Do
you
mind
so
little
what
I
said
but
now
?
<EOS>
Here
.
<EOS>
Take
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
uttered
a
moan
as
the
money
was
restored
,
but
without
in
any
other
way
opposing
its
restoration
,
hobbled
at
her
daughter
's
side
out
of
the
yard
,
and
along
the
bye
street
upon
which
it
opened
.
<EOS>
The
astonished
and
dismayed
<EOS>
Rob
staring
after
them
,
saw
that
they
stopped
,
and
fell
to
earnest
conversation
very
soon
;
and
more
than
once
observed
a
darkly
threatening
action
of
the
younger
woman
's
hand
(
obviously
having
reference
to
some
one
of
whom
they
spoke
)
,
and
a
crooning
feeble
imitation
of
it
on
the
part
of
Mrs
Brown
,
that
made
him
earnestly
hope
he
might
not
be
the
subject
of
their
discourse
.
  
<EOS>
With
the
present
consolation
that
they
were
gone
,
and
with
the
prospective
comfort
that
Mrs
Brown
could
not
live
for
ever
,
and
was
not
likely
to
live
long
to
trouble
him
,
the
Grinder
,
not
otherwise
regretting
his
misdeeds
than
as
they
were
attended
with
such
disagreeable
incidental
consequences
,
composed
his
ruffled
features
to
a
more
serene
expression
by
thinking
of
the
admirable
manner
in
which
he
had
disposed
of
Captain
Cuttle
(
a
reflection
that
seldom
failed
to
put
him
in
a
flow
of
spirits
)
,
and
went
to
the
Dombey
Counting
House
to
receive
his
master
's
orders
.
  
<EOS>
There
his
master
,
so
subtle
and
vigilant
of
eye
,
that
Rob
quaked
before
him
,
more
than
half
expecting
to
be
taxed
with
Mrs
Brown
,
gave
him
the
usual
morning
's
box
of
papers
for
Mr
Dombey
,
and
a
note
for
Mrs
Dombey
:
merely
nodding
his
head
as
an
enjoinder
to
be
careful
,
and
to
use
dispatch
---
a
mysterious
admonition
,
fraught
in
the
Grinder
's
imagination
with
dismal
warnings
and
threats
;
and
more
powerful
with
him
than
any
words
.
  
<EOS>
Alone
again
,
in
his
own
room
,
Mr
Carker
applied
himself
to
work
,
and
worked
all
day
.
<EOS>
He
saw
many
visitors
;
overlooked
a
number
of
documents
;
went
in
and
out
,
to
and
from
,
sundry
places
of
mercantile
resort
;
and
indulged
in
no
more
abstraction
until
the
day
's
business
was
done
.
<EOS>
But
,
when
the
usual
clearance
of
papers
from
his
table
was
made
at
last
,
he
fell
into
his
thoughtful
mood
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
standing
in
his
accustomed
place
and
attitude
,
with
his
eyes
intently
fixed
upon
the
ground
,
when
his
brother
entered
to
bring
back
some
letters
that
had
been
taken
out
in
the
course
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
He
put
them
quietly
on
the
table
,
and
was
going
immediately
,
when
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
,
whose
eyes
had
rested
on
him
,
on
his
entrance
,
as
if
they
has
all
this
time
had
him
for
the
subject
of
their
contemplation
,
instead
of
the
office
-
floor
,
said
:
  
"
Well
,
John
Carker
,
and
what
brings
you
here
?
"
  
<EOS>
His
brother
pointed
to
the
letters
,
and
was
again
withdrawing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
,
"
said
the
Manager
,
"
that
you
can
come
and
go
,
without
inquiring
how
our
master
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
had
word
this
morning
in
the
counting
-
house
,
that
Mr
Dombey
was
doing
well
,
"
replied
his
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
such
a
meek
fellow
,
"
said
the
Manager
,
with
a
smile
,
---
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
grown
so
,
in
the

if
any

came
to
him

you
'd
be
miserable

I
dare
swear
now

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
I
should
be
truly
sorry

James

returned
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
be
sorry
!
"
said
the
Manager
,
pointing
at
him
,
as
if
there
were
some
other
person
present
to
whom
he
was
appealing
.
<EOS>
"
He
would
be
truly
sorry
!
<EOS>
This
brother
of
mine!This
junior
of
the
place
,
this
slighted
piece
of
lumber
,
pushed
aside
with
his
face
to
the
wall
,
like
a
rotten
picture
,
and
left
so
,
for
Heaven
knows
how
many
years
:
he
's
all
gratitude
and
respect
,
and
devotion
too
,
he
would
have
me
believe
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
you
believe
nothing
,
James
,
"
returned
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Be
as
just
to
me
as
you
would
to
any
other
man
below
you
.
<EOS>
You
ask
a
question
,
and
I
answer
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
have
you
nothing
,
Spaniel
,
"
said
the
Manager
,
with
unusual
irascibility
,
"
to
complain
of
in
him
?
<EOS>
No
proud
treatment
to
resent
,
no
insolence
,
no
foolery
of
state
,
<EOS>
no
exaction
of
any
sort
!
<EOS>
What
the
devil
!
<EOS>
are
you
man
or
mouse
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
strange
if
any
two
persons
could
be
together
for
so
many
years
,
especially
as
superior
and
inferior
,
without
each
having
something
to
complain
of
in
the
other
---
as
he
thought
,
at
all
events
,
"
replied
John
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
But
apart
from
my
history
here
"
  
"
His
history
here
!
"
exclaimed
the
Manager
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
there
it
is
.
<EOS>
The
very
fact
that
makes
him
an
extreme
case
,
puts
him
out
of
the
whole
chapter
!
<EOS>
Well
?
"
  
"
Apart
from
that
,
which
,
as
you
hint
,
gives
me
a
reason
to
be
thankful
that
I
alone
(
happily
for
all
the
rest
)
possess
,
surely
there
is
no
one
in
the
House
who
would
not
say
and
feel
at
least
as
much
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
think
that
anybody
here
would
be
indifferent
to
a
mischance
or
misfortune
happening
to
the
head
of
the
House
,
or
anything
than
truly
sorry
for
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
good
reason
to
be
bound
to
him
too
!
"
said
the
Manager
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
do
n't
you
believe
that
you
are
kept
here
,
as
a
cheap
example
,
and
a
famous
instance
of
the
clemency
of
Dombey
and
Son
,
redounding
to
the
credit
of
the
illustrious
House
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
his
brother
,
mildly
,
"
I
have
long
believed
that
I
am
kept
here
for
more
kind
and
disinterested
reasons
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
were
going
,
"
said
the
Manager
,
with
the
snarl
of
a
tiger
-
cat
,
"
to
recite
some
Christian
precept
,
I
observed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
James
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
though
the
tie
of
brotherhood
between
us
has
been
long
broken
and
thrown
away
"
  
"
<EOS>
Who
broke
it
,
good
Sir
?
"
said
the
Manager
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
,
by
my
misconduct
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
charge
it
upon
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Manager
replied
,
with
that
mute
action
of
his
bristling
mouth
,
"
Oh
,
you
do
n't
charge
it
upon
me
!
"
and
bade
him
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
though
there
is
not
that
tie
between
us
,
do
not
,
I
entreat
,
assail
me
with
unnecessary
taunts
,
or
misinterpret
what
I
say
,
or
would
say
.
<EOS>
I
was
only
going
to
suggest
to
you
that
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
it
is
only
you
,
who
have
been
selected
here
,
above
all
others
,
for
advancement
,
confidence
and
distinction
(
selected
,
in
the
beginning
,
I
know
,
for
your
great
ability
and
trustfulness
)
,
and
who
communicate
more
freely
with
Mr
Dombey
than
any
one
,
and
stand
<EOS>
,
it
may
be
said
,
on
equal
terms
with
him
,
and
have
been
favoured
and
enriched
by
him
---
that
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
it
is
only
you
who
are
tender
of
his
welfare
and
reputation
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
one
in
the
House
,
from
yourself
down
to
the
lowest
,
I
sincerely
believe
,
who
does
not
participate
in
that
feeling
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
lie
!
"
said
the
Manager
,
red
with
sudden
anger
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
hypocrite
,
John
Carker
,
and
you
lie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
James
!
"
cried
the
other
,
flushing
in
his
turn
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
these
insulting
words
?
<EOS>
Why
do
you
so
basely
use
them
to
me
,
unprovoked
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
"
said
the
Manager
,
"
that
your
hypocrisy
and
meekness
---
that
all
the
hypocrisy
and
meekness
of
this
place
---
is
not
worth
that
to
me
,
"
snapping
his
thumb
and
finger
,
"
and
that
I
see
through
it
as
if
it
were
air
!
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
man
employed
here
,
standing
between
myself
and
the
lowest
in
place
(
of
whom
you
are
very
considerate
,
and
with
reason
,
for
he
is
not
far
off
)
,
who
would
n't
be
glad
at
heart
to
see
his
master
humbled
:
who
does
not
hate
him
,
secretly
:
who
does
not
wish
him
evil
rather
than
good
:
and
who
would
not
turn
upon
him
,
if
he
had
the
power
and
boldness
.
<EOS>
The
nearer
to
his
favour
,
the
nearer
to
his
insolence
;
the
closer
to
him
,
the
farther
from
him
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
creed
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
his
brother
,
whose
roused
feelings
had
soon
yielded
to
surprise
,
"
who
may
have
abused
your
ear
with
such
representations
;
or
why
have
chosen
to
try
me
,
rather
than
another
.
<EOS>
But
that
you
have
been
trying
me
,
and
tampering
with
me
,
I
am
now
sure
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
different
manner
and
a
different
aspect
from
any
that
I
ever
saw
in
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
only
say
to
you
,
once
more
,
you
are
deceived
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
am
,
"
said
the
Manager
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
you
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
by
me
,
"
returned
his
brother
.
<EOS>
"
By
your
informant
,
if
you
have
one
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
by
your
own
thoughts
and
suspicious
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
suspicions
,
"
said
the
Manager
.
<EOS>
"
Mine
are
certainties
.
<EOS>
You
pusillanimous
,
abject
,
cringing
dogs
!
<EOS>
All
making
the
same
show
,
all
canting
the
same
story
,
all
whining
the
same
professions
,
all
harbouring
the
same
transparent
secret
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
brother
withdrew
,
without
saying
more
,
and
shut
the
door
as
he
concluded
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
drew
a
chair
close
before
the
fire
,
and
fell
to
beating
the
coals
softly
with
the
poker
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
faint
-
hearted
,
fawning
knaves
,
"
he
muttered
,
with
his
two
shining
rows
of
teeth
laid
bare
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
not
one
among
them
,
who
would
n't
feign
to
be
so
shocked
and
outraged
---
!
<EOS>
Bah
!
<EOS>
There
's
not
one
among
them
,
but
if
he
had
at
once
the
power
,
and
the
wit
and
daring
to
use
it
,
would
scatter
Dombey
's
pride
and
lay
it
low
,
as
ruthlessly
as
I
rake
out
these
ashes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
broke
them
up
and
stewed
them
in
the
grate
,
he
looked
on
with
a
thoughtful
smile
at
what
he
was
doing
.
<EOS>
"
Without
the
same
queen
beckoner
too
!
"
he
added
presently
;
"
and
there
is
pride
there
,
not
to
be
forgotten
---
witness
our
own
acquaintance
!
"
<EOS>
With
that
he
fell
into
a
deeper
reverie
,
and
sat
pondering
over
the
blackening
grate
,
until
he
rose
up
like
a
man
who
had
been
absorbed
in
a
book
,
and
looking
round
<EOS>
him
took
his
hat
and
gloves
,
went
to
where
his
horse
was
waiting
,
mounted
,
and
rode
away
through
the
lighted
streets
,
for
it
was
evening
.
  
<EOS>
He
rode
near
Mr
Dombey
's
house
;
and
falling
into
a
walk
as
he
approached
it
,
looked
up
at
the
windows
.
<EOS>
The
window
where
he
had
once
seen
Florence
sitting
with
her
dog
,
attracted
his
attention
first
,
though
there
was
no
light
in
it
;
but
he
smiled
as
he
carried
his
eyes
up
the
tall
front
of
the
house
,
and
seemed
to
leave
that
object
superciliously
behind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Time
was
,
"
he
said
,
"
when
it
was
well
to
watch
even
your
rising
little
star
,
and
know
in
what
quarter
there
were
clouds
,
to
shadow
you
if
needful
.
<EOS>
But
a
planet
has
arisen
,
and
you
are
lost
in
its
light
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
turned
the
White
-
legged
horse
round
the
street
corner
,
and
sought
one
shining
window
from
among
those
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Associated
with
it
was
a
certain
stately
presence
,
a
gloved
hand
,
the
remembrance
how
the
feathers
of
a
beautiful
bird
's
wing
had
been
showered
down
upon
the
floor
,
and
how
the
light
white
down
upon
a
robe
had
stirred
and
rustled
,
as
in
the
rising
of
a
distant
storm
.
<EOS>
These
were
the
things
he
carried
with
him
as
he
turned
away
again
,
and
rode
through
the
darkening
and
deserted
Parks
at
a
quick
rate
.
  
<EOS>
In
fatal
truth
,
these
were
associated
with
a
woman
,
a
proud
woman
,
who
hated
him
,
but
who
by
slow
and
sure
degrees
had
been
led
on
by
his
craft
,
and
her
pride
and
resentment
,
to
endure
his
company
,
and
little
by
little
to
receive
him
as
one
who
had
the
privilege
to
talk
to
her
of
her
own
defiant
disregard
of
her
own
husband
,
and
her
abandonment
of
high
consideration
for
herself
.
<EOS>
They
were
associated
with
a
woman
who
hated
him
deeply
,
and
who
knew
him
,
and
who
mistrusted
him
because
she
knew
him
,
and
because
he
knew
her
;
but
who
fed
her
fierce
resentment
by
suffering
him
to
draw
nearer
and
yet
nearer
to
her
every
day
,
in
spite
of
the
hate
she
cherished
for
him
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
it
!
<EOS>
For
that
very
reason
;
since
in
its
depths
,
too
far
down
for
her
threatening
eye
to
pierce
,
though
she
could
see
into
them
dimly
,
lay
the
dark
retaliation
,
whose
faintest
shadow
seen
once
and
shuddered
at
,
and
never
seen
again
,
would
have
been
sufficient
stain
upon
her
soul
.
  
<EOS>
Did
the
phantom
of
such
a
woman
flit
about
him
on
his
ride
;
true
to
the
reality
,
and
obvious
to
him
?
  
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
He
was
her
in
his
mind
,
exactly
as
she
was
.
<EOS>
She
bore
him
company
with
her
pride
,
resentment
,
hatred
,
all
as
plain
to
him
as
her
beauty
;
with
nothing
plainer
to
him
than
her
hatred
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
saw
her
sometimes
haughty
and
repellent
at
his
side
,
and
sometimes
down
among
his
horse
's
feet
,
fallen
and
in
the
dust
.
<EOS>
But
he
always
saw
her
as
she
was
,
without
disguise
,
and
watched
her
on
the
dangerous
way
that
she
was
going
.
  
<EOS>
And
when
his
ride
was
over
,
and
he
was
newly
dressed
,
and
came
into
the
light
of
her
bright
room
with
his
bent
head
,
soft
voice
,
and
soothing
smile
,
he
saw
her
yet
as
plainly
.
<EOS>
He
even
suspected
the
mystery
of
the
gloved
hand
,
and
held
it
all
the
longer
in
his
own
for
that
suspicion
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
dangerous
way
that
she
was
going
,
he
was
still
;
and
not
a
footprint
<EOS>
did
she
mark
upon
it
,
but
he
set
his
own
there
,
straight
.
    
Chapter

<EOS>
The
Flight
of
Florence
 
IN
the
wildness
of
her
sorrow
,
shame
,
and
terror
,
the
forlorn
girl
hurried
through
the
sunshine
of
a
bright
morning
,
as
if
it
were
the
darkness
of
a
winter
night
.
<EOS>
Wringing
her
hands
and
weeping
bitterly
,
insensible
to
everything
<EOS>
but
the
deep
wound
in
her
breast
,
stunned
by
the
loss
of
all
she
loved
,
left
like
the
sole
survivor
on
a
lonely
shore
from
the
wreck
of
a
great
vessel
,
she
fled
without
a
thought
,
without
a
hope
,
without
a
purpose
,
but
to
fly
somewhere
---
anywhere
.
  
<EOS>
The
cheerful
vista
of
the
long
street
,
burnished
by
the
morning
light
,
the
sight
of
the
blue
sky
and
airy
clouds
,
the
vigorous
freshness
of
the
day
,
so
flushed
and
rosy
in
its
conquest
of
the
night
,
awakened
no
responsive
feelings
in
her
so
hurt
bosom
.
<EOS>
Somewhere
,
anywhere
,
to
hide
her
head
!
<EOS>
somewhere
,
anywhere
,
for
refuge
,
never
more
to
look
upon
the
place
from
which
she
fled
!
  
<EOS>
But
there
were
people
going
to
and
fro
;
there
were
opening
shops
,
and
servants
at
the
doors
of
houses
;
there
was
the
rising
clash
and
roar
of
the
day
's
struggle
.
<EOS>
Florence
saw
surprise
and
curiosity
in
the
faces
flitting
past
her
;
saw
long
shadows
coming
back
upon
the
pavement
;
and
heard
voices
that
were
strange
to
her
asking
her
where
she
went
,
and
what
the
matter
was
;
and
though
these
frightened
her
the
more
at
first
,
and
made
her
hurry
on
the
faster
,
they
did
her
the
good
service
of
recalling
her
in
some
degree
to
herself
,
and
reminding
her
of
the
necessity
of
greater
composure
.
  
<EOS>
Where
to
go
?
<EOS>
Still
somewhere
,
anywhere
!
<EOS>
still
going
on
;
but
where
!
<EOS>
She
thought
of
the
only
other
time
she
had
been
lost
in
the
wild
wilderness
of
London
---
though
not
lost
as
now
---
and
went
that
way
.
<EOS>
To
the
home
of
Walter
's
uncle
.
  
<EOS>
Checking
her
sobs
,
and
drying
her
swollen
eyes
,
and
endeavouring
to
calm
the
agitation
of
her
manner
,
so
as
to
avoid
attracting
notice
,
Florence
,
resolving
to
keep
to
the
more
quiet
streets
as
long
as
she
could
,
was
going
on
more
quietly
herself
,
when
a
familiar
little
shadow
darted
past
upon
the
sunny
pavement
,
stopped
short
,
wheeled
about
,
came
close
to
her
,
made
off
again
,
bounded
round
and
round
her
,
and
Diogenes
,
panting
for
breath
,
and
yet
making
the
street
ring
with
his
glad
bark
,
was
at
her
feet
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Di
!
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
,
true
,
faithful
Di
,
how
did
you
come
here
?
<EOS>
How
could
I
ever
leave
you
,
Di
,
who
would
never
leave
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
Florence
bent
down
on
the
pavement
,
and
laid
his
rough
,
old
,
loving
,
foolish
head
against
her
breast
,
and
they
got
up
together
,
and
went
on
together
;
Di
more
off
the
ground
than
on
it
,
endeavouring
to
kiss
his
mistress
flying
,
tumbling
over
and
getting
up
again
without
the
least
concern
,
dashing
at
big
dogs
in
a
jocose
defiance
of
his
species
,
terrifying
with
touches
of
his
nose
young
housemaids
who
were
cleaning
doorsteps
,
and
continually
stopping
,
in
the
midst
of
a
thousand
extravagances
,
to
look
back
at
Florence
,
and
bark
until
all
the
dogs
within
hearing
answered
,
and
all
the
dogs
who
could
come
out
,
came
out
to
stare
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
With
this
last
adherent
,
Florence
hurried
away
in
the
advancing
morning
,
and
the
strengthening
sunshine
,
to
the
City
.
<EOS>
The
roar
soon
grew
more
loud
,
the
passengers
more
numerous
,
the
shops
more
busy
,
until
she
was
carried
onward
in
a
stream
of
life
setting
that
way
,
and
flowing
,
indifferently
,
past
marts
and
mansions
,
prisons
,
churches
,
market
-
places
,
wealth
,
poverty
,
good
,
and
evil
,
like
the
broad
river
side
by
side
with
it
,
awakened
from
its
dreams
of
rushes
,
willows
,
and
green
moss
,
and
rolling
on
,
turbid
and
troubled
,
among
the
works
and
cares
of
men
,
to
the
deep
sea
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
the
quarters
of
the
little
Midshipman
arose
in
view
.
<EOS>
Nearer
yet
,
and
the
little
Midshipman
himself
was
seen
upon
his
post
,
intent
as
ever
on
his
observations
.
<EOS>
Nearer
yet
,
and
the
door
stood
open
,
inviting
her
to
enter
.
<EOS>
Florence
,
who
had
again
quickened
her
pace
,
as
she
approached
the
end
of
her
journey
,
ran
across
the
road
(
closely
followed
by
Diogenes
,
whom
the
bustle
had
somewhat
confused
)
,
ran
in
,
and
sank
upon
the
threshold
of
the
well
-
remembered
little
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
in
his
glazed
hat
,
was
standing
over
the
fire
,
making
his
morning
's
cocoa
,
with
that
elegant
trifle
,
his
watch
,
upon
the
chimney
-
piece
,
for
easy
reference
during
the
progress
of
the
cookery
.
<EOS>
Hearing
a
footstep
and
the
rustle
of
a
dress
,
the
Captain
turned
with
a
palpitating
remembrance
of
the
dreadful
Mrs
MacStinger
,
at
the
instant
when
Florence
made
a
motion
with
her
hand
towards
him
,
reeled
,
and
fell
upon
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
pale
as
Florence
,
pale
in
the
very
knobs
upon
his
face
,
raised
her
like
a
baby
,
and
laid
her
on
the
same
old
sofa
upon
which
she
had
slumbered
long
ago
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
Heart
's
Delight
!
"
said
the
Captain
,
looking
intently
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
sweet
creetur
grow'd
<EOS>
a
woman
!
"
   
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
was
so
respectful
of
her
,
and
had
such
a
reverence
for
her
,
in
this
new
character
,
that
he
would
not
have
held
her
in
his
arms
,
while
she
was
unconscious
,
for
a
thousand
pounds
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
Heart
's
Delight
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
Captain
,
withdrawing
to
a
little
distance
,
with
the
greatest
alarm
and
sympathy
depicted
on
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
can
hail
Ned
Cuttle
with
a
finger
,
do
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
Florence
did
not
stir
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
Heart
's
Delight
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
trembling
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
For
the
sake
of
Wal'r
drownded
in
the
briny
deep
,
turn
to
,
and
histe
up
something
or
another
,
if
able
.
"
  
<EOS>
Finding
her
insensible
to
this
impressive
adjuration
also
,
Captain
Cuttle
snatched
from
his
breakfast
-
table
a
basin
of
cold
water
,
and
sprinkled
some
upon
her
face
.
<EOS>
Yielding
to
the
urgency
of
the
case
,
the
Captain
then
,
using
his
immense
hand
with
extraordinary
gentleness
,
relieved
her
of
her
bonnet
,
moistened
her
lips
and
forehead
,
put
back
her
hair
,
covered
her
feet
with
his
own
coat
which
he
pulled
off
for
the
purpose
,
patted
her
hand
---
so
small
in
his
,
that
he
was
struck
with
wonder
when
he
touched
it
---
and
seeing
that
her
eyelids
quivered
,
and
that
her
lips
began
to
move
,
continued
these
restorative
applications
with
a
better
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cheerily
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Cheerily
!
<EOS>
Stand
by
,
my
pretty
one
,
stand
by
!
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
You
're
better
now
.
<EOS>
Steady
's
the
word
,
and
steady
it
is
.
<EOS>
Keep
her
so
!
<EOS>
Drink
a
little
drop
<EOS>
o
'
this
here
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
There
you
are
!
<EOS>
What
cheer
now
,
my
pretty
,
what
cheer
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
stage
of
her
recovery
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
with
an
imperfect
association
of
a
Watch
with
a
Physician
's
treatment
of
a
patient
,
took
his
own
down
from
the
mantel
-
shelf
,
and
holding
it
out
on
his
hook
,
and
taking
Florence
's
hand
in
his
,
looked
steadily
from
one
to
the
other
,
as
expecting
the
dial
to
do
something
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
cheer
,
my
pretty
?
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
What
cheer
now
?
<EOS>
You
've
done
her
some
good
,
my
lad
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
under
his
breath
,
and
throwing
an
approving
glance
upon
his
watch
.
<EOS>
"
Put
you
back
half
-
an
-
hour
every
morning
,
and
about
another
quarter
towards
the
afternoon
,
and
you
're
a
watch
as
can
be
ekalled
by
few
and
excelled
by
none
.
<EOS>
What
cheer
,
my
lady
lass
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Cuttle
!
<EOS>
Is
it
you
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Florence
,
raising
herself
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
my
lady
lass
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
hastily
deciding
in
his
own
mind
upon
the
superior
elegance
of
that
form
of
address
,
as
the
most
courtly
he
could
think
of
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Walter
's
uncle
here
?
"
asked
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
pretty
?
"
returned
the
Captain
.
"
<EOS>
He
an't
been
here
this
many
a
long
day
.
<EOS>
He
an't
been
heerd
on
,
since
he
sheered
off
arter
poor
Wal'r
.
<EOS>
But
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
as
a
quotation
,
"
Though
lost
to
sight
,
to
memory
dear
,
and
England
,
Home
,
and
Beauty
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
live
here
?
"
asked
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
lady
lass
,
"
returned
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Captain
Cuttle
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Florence
,
putting
her
hands
together
,
and
speaking
wildly
.
"
<EOS>
Save
me
!
<EOS>
keep
me
here
!
<EOS>
Let
no
one
know
where
I
am
!
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
has
happened
by
-
and
-
by
,
when
I
can
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
one
in
the
world
to
go
to
.
<EOS>
Do
not
send
me
away
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Send
you
away
,
my
lady
lass
!
"
exclaimed
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
You
,
my
Heart
's
Delight
!
<EOS>
Stay
a
bit
!
<EOS>
We
'll
put
up
this
here
deadlight
,
and
take
a
double
turn
on
the
key
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
the
Captain
,
using
his
one
hand
and
his
hook
with
the
greatest
dexterity
,
got
out
the
shutter
of
the
door
,
put
it
up
,
made
it
all
fast
,
and
locked
the
door
itself
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
came
back
to
the
side
of
Florence
,
she
took
his
hand
,
and
kissed
it
.
<EOS>
The
helplessness
of
the
action
,
the
appeal
it
made
to
him
,
the
confidence
it
expressed
,
the
unspeakable
sorrow
in
her
face
,
the
pain
of
mind
she
had
too
plainly
suffered
,
and
was
suffering
then
,
his
knowledge
of
her
past
history
,
her
present
lonely
,
worn
,
and
unprotected
appearance
,
all
so
rushed
upon
the
good
Captain
together
,
that
he
fairly
overflowed
with
compassion
and
gentleness
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lady
lass
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
polishing
the
bridge
of
his
nose
with
his
arm
until
it
shone
like
burnished
copper
,
"
do
n't
you
say
a
word
to
Ed'ard
<EOS>
Cuttle
,
until
such
times
as
you
finds
yourself
a
riding
smooth
and
easy
;
which
wo
n't
be
to
-
day
,
nor
yet
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
giving
of
you
up
,
or
reporting
where
you
are
,
yes
verily
,
and
by
God
's
help
,
so
I
wo
n't
,
Church
catechism
,
make
a
note
on
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
the
Captain
said
,
reference
and
all
,
in
one
breath
,
and
with
much
solemnity
;
taking
off
his
hat
at
"
yes
verily
,
"
and
putting
it
on
again
,
when
he
had
quite
concluded
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
could
do
but
one
thing
more
to
thank
him
,
and
to
show
him
how
she
trusted
in
him
;
and
she
did
it
.
<EOS>
Clinging
to
this
rough
creature
as
the
last
asylum
of
her
bleeding
heart
,
she
laid
her
head
upon
his
honest
shoulder
,
and
clasped
him
round
his
neck
,
and
would
have
kneeled
down
to
bless
him
,
but
that
he
divined
her
purpose
,
and
held
her
up
like
a
true
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Steady
!
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Steady
!
<EOS>
You
're
too
weak
to
stand
,
you
see
,
my
pretty
,
and
must
lie
down
here
again
.
<EOS>
There
,
there
!
<EOS>
"
To
see
the
Captain
lift
her
on
the
sofa
,
and
cover
her
with
his
coat
,
would
have
been
worth
a
hundred
state
sights
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
you
must
take
some
breakfast
,
lady
lass
,
and
the
dog
shall
have
some
too
.
<EOS>
And
arter
that
you
shall
go
aloft
to
old
<EOS>
Sol
Gills
's
room
,
and
fall
asleep
there
,
like
a
angel
.
"
   
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
patted
Diogenes
when
he
made
allusion
to
him
,
and
Diogenes
met
that
overture
graciously
,
half
-
way
.
<EOS>
During
the
administration
of
the
restoratives
he
had
clearly
been
in
two
minds
whether
to
fly
at
the
Captain
or
to
offer
him
his
friendship
;
and
he
had
expressed
that
conflict
of
feeling
by
alternate
waggings
of
his
tail
,
and
displays
of
his
teeth
,
with
now
and
then
a
growl
or
so
.
<EOS>
But
by
this
time
his
doubts
were
all
removed
.
<EOS>
It
was
plain
that
he
considered
the
Captain
one
of
the
most
amiable
of
men
,
and
a
man
whom
it
was
an
honour
to
a
dog
to
know
.
  
<EOS>
In
evidence
of
these
convictions
,
Diogenes
attended
on
the
Captain
while
he
made
some
tea
and
toast
,
and
showed
a
lively
interest
in
his
housekeeping
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
in
vain
for
the
kind
Captain
to
make
such
preparations
for
Florence
,
who
sorely
tried
to
do
some
honour
to
them
,
but
could
touch
nothing
,
and
could
only
weep
and
weep
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
!
"
said
the
compassionate
Captain
,
"
arter
turning
in
,
my
Heart
's
Delight
<EOS>
,
you
'll
get
more
way
upon
you
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
'll
serve
out
your
allowance
,
my
lad
.
"
<EOS>
To
Diogenes
.
<EOS>
"
And
you
shall
keep
guard
on
your
mistress
aloft
.
"
  
<EOS>
Diogenes
,
however
,
although
he
had
been
eyeing
his
intended
breakfast
with
a
watering
mouth
and
glistening
eyes
,
instead
of
falling
to
,
ravenously
,
when
it
was
put
before
him
,
pricked
up
his
ears
,
darted
to
the
shop
-
door
,
and
barked
there
furiously
:
burrowing
with
his
head
at
the
bottom
,
as
if
he
were
bent
on
mining
his
way
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
there
be
anybody
there
!
"
<EOS>
asked
Florence
,
in
alarm
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
lady
lass
,
"
returned
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
Who
'd
stay
there
,
without
making
any
noise
!
<EOS>
Keep
up
a
good
heart
,
pretty
.
<EOS>
It
's
only
people
going
by
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
for
all
that
,
Diogenes
barked
and
barked
,
and
burrowed
and
burrowed
,
with
pertinacious
fury
;
and
whenever
he
stopped
to
listen
,
appeared
to
receive
some
new
conviction
into
his
mind
,
for
he
set
to
,
barking
and
burrowing
again
,
a
dozen
times
.
<EOS>
Even
when
he
was
persuaded
to
return
to
his
breakfast
,
he
came
jogging
back
to
it
,
with
a
very
doubtful
air
;
and
was
off
again
,
in
another
paroxysm
,
before
touching
a
morsel
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
there
should
be
some
one
listening
and
watching
,
"
whispered
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
Some
one
who
saw
me
come
---
who
followed
me
,
perhaps
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
an't
<EOS>
the
young
woman
,
lady
lass
,
is
it
?
"
said
the
Captain
,
taken
with
a
bright
idea
.
  
<EOS>
"
Susan
?
"
said
Florence
,
shaking
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
no
!
<EOS>
Susan
has
been
gone
from
me
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
deserted
,
I
hope
?
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
that
that
there
young
woman
's
run
,
my
pretty
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
no
!
"
cried
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
one
of
the
truest
hearts
in
the
world
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
was
greatly
relieved
by
this
reply
,
and
expressed
his
satisfaction
by
taking
off
his
hard
glazed
hat
,
and
dabbing
his
head
all
over
with
his
handkerchief
,
rolled
up
like
a
ball
,
observing
several
times
,
with
infinite
complacency
,
and
with
a
beaming
countenance
,
that
he
know'd
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
're
quiet
now
,
are
you
,
brother
?
"
said
the
Captain
to
Diogenes
.
<EOS>
"
There
warn't
nobody
there
,
my
lady
lass
,
bless
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Diogenes
was
not
so
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
The
door
still
had
an
attraction
for
him
at
intervals
;
and
he
went
snuffing
about
it
,
and
growling
to
himself
,
unable
to
forget
the
subject
.
<EOS>
This
incident
,
coupled
with
the
Captain
's
observation
of
Florence
's
fatigue
and
faintness
,
decided
him
to
prepare
Sol
Gills
's
chamber
as
a
place
of
retirement
for
her
immediately
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
hastily
betook
himself
to
the
top
of
the
house
,
and
made
the
best
arrangement
of
it
that
his
imagination
and
his
means
suggested
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
very
clean
already
;
and
the
Captain
being
an
orderly
man
,
and
accustomed
to
make
things
ship
-
shape
,
converted
the
bed
into
a
couch
,
by
covering
it
all
over
with
a
clean
white
drapery
.
<EOS>
By
a
similar
contrivance
,
the
Captain
converted
the
little
dressing
-
table
into
a
species
of
alter
,
on
which
he
set
forth
two
silver
teaspoons
,
a
flower
-
pot
,
a
telescope
,
his
celebrated
watch
,
a
pocket
-
comb
,
and
a
song
-
book
,
as
a
small
collection
of
rarities
,
that
made
a
choice
appearance
.
<EOS>
Having
darkened
the
window
,
and
straightened
the
pieces
of
carpet
on
the
floor
,
the
Captain
surveyed
these
preparations
with
great
delight
,
and
descended
to
the
little
parlour
again
,
to
bring
Florence
to
her
bower
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
would
induce
the
Captain
to
believe
that
it
was
possible
for
Florence
to
walk
upstairs
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
have
got
the
idea
into
his
head
,
he
would
have
considered
it
an
outrageous
breach
of
hospitality
to
allow
her
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Florence
was
too
weak
to
dispute
the
point
,
and
the
Captain
carried
her
up
out
of
hand
,
laid
her
down
,
and
covered
her
with
a
great
watch
-
coat
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lady
lass
!
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
you
're
as
safe
here
as
if
you
was
at
the
top
of
St
Paul
's
Cathedral
,
with
the
ladder
cast
off
.
<EOS>
Sleep
is
what
you
want
,
afore
all
other
things
,
and
may
you
be
able
to
show
yourself
smart
with
that
there
balsam
for
the
still
small
woice
of
a
wownded
mind
!
<EOS>
When
there
's
anything
you
want
,
my
Heart
's
Delight
,
as
this
here
humble
house
or
town
can
offer
,
pass
the
word
to
Ed'ard
Cuttle
,
as'll
stand
off
and
on
outside
that
door
,
and
that
there
man
will
wibrate
with
joy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Captain
concluded
by
kissing
the
hand
that
Florence
stretched
out
to
him
,
with
the
chivalry
of
any
old
knight
-
errant
,
and
walking
on
tip
-
toe
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Descending
to
the
little
parlour
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
after
holding
a
hasty
council
with
himself
,
decided
to
open
the
shopdoor
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
satisfy
himself
that
now
,
at
all
events
,
there
was
no
one
loitering
about
it
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
he
set
it
open
,
and
stood
upon
the
threshold
,
keeping
a
bright
look
-
out
,
and
sweeping
the
whole
street
with
his
spectacles
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
de
do
,
Captain
Gills
?
<EOS>
"
said
a
voice
beside
him
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
looking
down
,
found
that
he
had
been
boarded
by
Mr
Toots
while
sweeping
the
horizon
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
,
my
lad
?
"
replied
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'm
pretty
well
,
thank'ee
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
'm
never
quite
what
I
could
wish
to
be
,
now
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
expect
that
I
ever
shall
be
any
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
never
approached
any
nearer
than
this
to
the
great
theme
of
his
life
,
when
in
conversation
with
Captain
Cuttle
,
on
account
of
the
agreement
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Gills
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
if
I
could
have
the
pleasure
of
a
word
with
you
<EOS>
,
it
's
---
<EOS>
it
's
rather
particular
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
see
,
my
lad
,
"
replied
the
Captain
,
leading
the
way
into
the
parlour
,
"
<EOS>
I
an't
what
you
may
call
exactly
free
this
morning
;
and
therefore
if
you
can
clap
on
a
bit
,
I
should
take
it
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
replied
Mr
Toots
,
who
seldom
had
any
notion
of
the
Captain
's
meaning
.
"
<EOS>
To
clap
on
,
is
exactly
what
I
could
wish
to
do
.
<EOS>
Naturally
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
so
be
,
my
lad
,
"
returned
the
Captain
,
"
do
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
was
so
impressed
by
the
possession
of
his
tremendous
secret
---
by
the
fact
of
Miss
Dombey
being
at
that
moment
under
his
roof
,
while
the
innocent
and
unconscious
Toots
sat
opposite
to
him
---
that
a
perspiration
broke
out
on
his
forehead
,
and
he
found
it
impossible
while
slowly
drying
the
same
,
glazed
hat
in
hand
,
to
keep
his
eyes
off
Mr
Toots
's
face
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
who
himself
appeared
to
have
some
secret
reasons
for
being
in
a
nervous
state
,
was
so
unspeakably
disconcerted
by
the
Captain
's
stare
,
that
after
looking
at
him
vacantly
for
some
time
in
silence
,
and
shifting
uneasily
on
his
chair
,
he
said
:
  
"
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Captain
Gills
,
but
you
do
n't
happen
to
see
anything
particular
in
me
,
do
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
lad
,
"
returned
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
"
  
"
Because
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
with
a
chuckle
,
"
<EOS>
I
KNOW
I
'm
wasting
away
.
<EOS>
You
need
n't
at
all
mind
alluding
to
that
.
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
should
like
it
.
<EOS>
Burgess
and
Co.
have
altered
my
measure
<EOS>
,
I
'm
in
that
state
of
thinness
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
gratification
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
'm
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
---
<EOS>
I
'd
a
great
deal
rather
go
into
a
decline
,
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
I
'm
a
mere
brute
you
know
,
grazing
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
,
Captain
Gills
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
more
Mr
Toots
went
on
in
this
way
,
the
more
the
Captain
was
weighed
down
by
his
secret
,
and
stared
at
him
.
<EOS>
What
with
this
cause
of
uneasiness
,
and
his
desire
to
get
rid
of
Mr
Toots
,
the
Captain
was
in
such
a
scared
and
strange
condition
,
indeed
,
that
if
he
had
been
in
conversation
with
a
ghost
,
he
could
hardly
have
evinced
greater
discomposure
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
was
going
to
say
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
Happening
to
be
this
way
early
this
morning
---
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
was
coming
to
breakfast
with
you
.
<EOS>
As
to
sleep
,
you
know
,
I
never
sleep
now
.
<EOS>
I
might
be
a
Watchman
,
except
that
I
do
n't
get
any
pay
,
and
he
's
got
nothing
on
his
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Carry
on
,
my
lad
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
Captain
,
in
an
admonitory
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Perfectly
true!Happening
to
be
this
way
early
this
morning
(
an
hour
or
so
ago
)
,
and
finding
the
door
shut
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
were
you
waiting
there
,
brother
?
"
demanded
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
returned
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
stop
a
moment
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
were
out
.
<EOS>
But
the
person
said
---
by
the
bye
you
do
n't
keep
a
dog
,
do
you
,
Captain
Gills
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
that
's
exactly
what
I
said
.
<EOS>
I
knew
you
did
n't
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
dog
,
Captain
Gills
,
connected
with
---
but
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
That
's
forbidden
ground
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
stared
at
Mr
Toots
until
he
seemed
to
swell
to
twice
his
natural
size
;
and
again
the
perspiration
broke
out
on
the
Captain
's
forehead
,
when
he
thought
of
Diogenes
taking
it
into
his
head
to
come
down
and
make
a
third
in
the
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
person
said
,
"
continued
Mr
Toots
,
"
that
he
had
heard
a
dog
barking
in
the
shop
:
which
I
knew
could
n't
be
,
and
I
told
him
so
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
as
positive
as
if
he
had
seen
the
dog
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
person
,
my
lad
?
"
inquired
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
see
there
it
is
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
with
a
perceptible
increase
in
the
nervousness
of
his
manner
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
for
me
to
say
what
may
have
taken
place
,
or
what
may
not
have
taken
place
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
I
get
mixed
up
with
all
sorts
of
things
that
I
do
n't
quite
understand
,
and
I
think
there
's
something
rather
weak
in
my
---
in
my
head
,
in
short
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
nodded
his
own
,
as
a
mark
of
assent
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
person
said
,
as
we
were
walking
away
,
"
continued
Mr
Toots
,
"
that
you
knew
what
,
under
existing
circumstances
,
might
occur
---
he
said
"
Might
,
"
very
strongly
---
and
that
if
you
were
requested
to
prepare
yourself
,
you
would
,
no
doubt
,
come
prepared
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Person
,
my
lad
!
"
<EOS>
the
Captain
repeated
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
person
,
I
'm
sure
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
replied
Mr
Toots
,
"
I
have
n't
the
least
idea
.
<EOS>
But
coming
to
the
door
,
I
found
him
waiting
there
;
and
he
said
was
I
coming
back
again
,
and
<EOS>
I
said
yes
;
and
he
said
did
I
know
you
,
and
<EOS>
I
said
yes
,
I
had
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
<EOS>
---
you
had
given
me
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
,
after
some
persuasion
;
and
he
said
,
if
that
was
the
case
,
would
I
say
to
you
what
I
have
said
,
about
existing
circumstances
and
coming
prepared
,
and
as
soon
as
ever
<EOS>
I
saw
you
,
would
I
ask
you
to
step
round
the
corner
,
if
it
was
only
for
one
minute
,
on
most
important
business
,
to
Mr
Brogley
's
the
Broker
's
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
Captain
Gills
---
<EOS>
whatever
it
is
,
I
am
convinced
it
's
very
important
;
and
if
you
like
to
step
round
,
now
,
I
'll
wait
here
till
you
come
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
divided
between
his
fear
of
compromising
Florence
in
some
way
by
not
going
,
and
his
horror
of
leaving
Mr
Toots
in
possession
of
the
house
with
a
chance
of
finding
out
the
secret
,
was
a
spectacle
of
mental
disturbance
that
even
Mr
Toots
could
not
be
blind
to
.
<EOS>
But
that
young
gentleman
,
considering
his
nautical
friend
as
merely
in
a
state
of
preparation
for
the
interview
he
was
going
to
have
,
was
quite
satisfied
,
and
did
not
review
his
own
discreet
conduct
without
chuckles
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
the
Captain
decided
,
as
the
lesser
of
two
evils
,
to
run
round
to
Brogley
's
the
Broker
's
:
previously
locking
the
door
that
communicated
with
the
upper
part
of
the
house
,
and
putting
the
key
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
If
so
be
,
"
said
the
Captain
to
Mr
Toots
,
with
not
a
little
shame
and
hesitation
,
"
as
you
'll
excuse
my
doing
of
it
,
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Captain
Gills
,
"
returned
Mr
Toots
,
"
whatever
you
do
,
is
satisfactory
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
thanked
him
heartily
,
and
promising
to
come
back
in
less
that
five
minutes
,
went
out
in
quest
of
the
person
who
had
intrusted
Mr
Toots
with
this
mysterious
message
.
<EOS>
Poor
Mr
Toots
,
left
to
himself
,
lay
down
upon
the
sofa
,
little
thinking
who
had
reclined
there
last
,
and
gazing
up
at
the
skylight
and
resigning
himself
to
visions
of
Miss
Dombey
,
lost
all
heed
of
time
and
place
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
as
well
that
he
did
so
;
for
although
the
Captain
was
not
gone
long
,
he
was
gone
much
longer
than
he
had
proposed
.
<EOS>
When
he
came
back
,
he
was
very
pale
indeed
,
and
greatly
agitated
,
and
even
looked
as
if
he
had
been
shedding
tears
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
have
lost
the
faculty
of
speech
,
until
he
had
been
to
the
cupboard
and
taken
a
dram
of
rum
from
the
case
-
bottle
,
when
he
fetched
a
deep
breath
,
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
with
his
hand
before
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Gills
,
"
said
Toots
,
kindly
,
"
I
hope
and
trust
<EOS>
there
's
nothing
wrong
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
my
lad
,
not
a
bit
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
"
<EOS>
Quite
contrary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
the
appearance
of
being
overcome
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
observed
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
lad
,
I
am
took
aback
,
"
the
Captain
admitted
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anything
I
can
do
,
Captain
Gills
?
"
inquired
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
If
there
is
,
make
use
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
removed
his
hand
from
his
face
,
looked
at
him
with
a
remarkable
expression
of
pity
and
tenderness
,
and
took
him
by
the
hand
and
shook
it
hard
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank'ee
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
.
<EOS>
Only
I
'll
take
it
as
a
favour
if
you
'll
part
company
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
brother
,
"
wringing
his
hand
again
,
"
that
,
after
Wal'r
,
and
on
a
different
model
,
you
're
as
good
a
lad
as
ever
stepped
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Upon
my
word
and
honour
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
returned
Mr
Toots
,
giving
the
Captain
's
hand
a
preliminary
slap
before
shaking
it
again
,
"
it
's
delightful
to
me
to
possess
your
good
opinion
.
<EOS>
Thank'ee
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
bear
hand
and
cheer
up
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
patting
him
on
the
back
.
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
There
's
more
than
one
sweet
creetur
in
the
world
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
to
me
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
replied
Mr
Toots
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
Not
to
me
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
The
state
of
my
feelings
towards
Miss
Dombey
is
of
that
unspeakable
description
,
that
my
heart
is
a
desert
island
,
and
she
lives
in
it
alone
.
<EOS>
I
'm
getting
more
used
up
every
day
,
and
I
'm
proud
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
If
you
could
see
my
legs
when
I
take
my
boots
off
,
you
'd
form
some
idea
of
what
unrequited
affection
is
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
prescribed
bark
,
but
I
do
n't
take
it
,
for
I
do
n't
wish
to
have
any
tone
whatever
given
to
my
constitution
.
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
not
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
is
forbidden
ground
.
<EOS>
Captain
Gills
,
good
-
bye
!
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
cordially
reciprocating
the
warmth
of
Mr
Toots
's
farewell
,
locked
the
door
behind
him
,
and
shaking
his
head
with
the
same
remarkable
expression
of
pity
and
tenderness
as
he
had
regarded
him
with
before
,
went
up
to
see
if
Florence
wanted
him
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
an
entire
change
in
the
Captain
's
face
as
he
went
upstairs
.
<EOS>
He
wiped
his
eyes
with
his
handkerchief
,
and
he
polished
the
bridge
of
his
nose
with
his
sleeve
as
he
had
done
already
that
morning
,
but
his
face
was
absolutely
changed
.
<EOS>
Now
,
he
might
have
been
thought
supremely
happy
;
now
,
he
might
have
been
thought
sad
;
but
the
kind
of
gravity
that
sat
upon
his
features
was
quite
new
to
them
,
and
was
as
great
an
improvement
to
them
as
if
they
had
undergone
some
sublimating
process
.
  
<EOS>
He
knocked
softly
,
with
his
hook
,
at
Florence
's
door
,
twice
or
thrice
;
but
,
receiving
no
answer
,
ventured
first
to
peep
in
,
and
then
to
enter
:
emboldened
to
take
the
latter
step
,
perhaps
,
by
the
familiar
recognition
of
Diogenes
,
who
,
stretched
upon
the
ground
by
the
side
of
her
couch
,
wagged
his
tail
,
and
winked
his
eyes
at
the
Captain
,
without
being
at
the
trouble
of
getting
up
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
sleeping
heavily
,
and
moaning
in
her
sleep
;
and
Captain
Cuttle
,
with
a
perfect
awe
of
her
youth
and
beauty
,
and
her
sorrow
,
raised
her
head
,
and
adjusted
the
coat
that
covered
her
,
where
it
had
fallen
off
,
and
darkened
the
window
a
little
more
that
she
might
sleep
on
,
and
crept
out
again
,
and
took
his
post
of
watch
upon
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
All
this
,
with
a
touch
and
tread
as
light
as
Florence
's
own
.
  
<EOS>
Long
may
it
remain
in
this
mixed
world
a
point
not
easy
of
decision
,
which
is
the
more
beautiful
evidence
of
the
Almighty
's
goodness
---
the
delicate
fingers
that
are
formed
for
sensitiveness
and
sympathy
of
touch
,
and
made
to
minister
to
pain
and
grief
,
or
the
rough
hard
Captain
Cuttle
hand
,
that
the
heart
teaches
,
guides
,
and
softens
in
a
moment
!
  
<EOS>
Florence
slept
upon
her
couch
,
forgetful
of
her
homelessness
and
orphanage
,
and
Captain
Cuttle
watched
upon
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
A
louder
sob
or
moan
than
usual
,
brought
him
sometimes
to
her
door
;
but
by
degrees
she
slept
more
peacefully
,
and
the
Captain
's
watch
was
undisturbed
.
   
<EOS>
Chapter
49
.
<EOS>
The
Midshipman
makes
a
Discovery
 
IT
was
long
before
Florence
awoke
.
<EOS>
The
day
was
in
its
prime
,
the
day
was
in
its
wane
,
and
still
,
uneasy
in
mind
and
body
,
she
slept
on
;
unconscious
of
her
strange
bed
,
of
the
noise
and
turmoil
in
the
street
,
and
of
the
light
that
shone
outside
the
shaded
window
.
<EOS>
Perfect
unconsciousness
of
what
had
happened
in
the
home
that
existed
no
more
,
even
the
deep
slumber
of
exhaustion
could
not
produce
.
<EOS>
Some
undefined
and
mournful
recollection
of
it
,
dozing
uneasily
but
never
sleeping
,
pervaded
all
her
rest
.
<EOS>
A
dull
sorrow
,
like
a
half
-
lulled
sense
of
pain
,
was
always
present
to
her
;
and
her
pale
cheek
was
oftener
wet
with
tears
than
the
honest
Captain
,
softly
putting
in
his
head
from
time
to
time
at
the
half
-
closed
door
,
<EOS>
could
have
desired
to
see
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
sun
was
getting
low
in
the
west
,
and
glancing
out
of
a
red
mist
,
pierced
with
its
rays
opposite
loop
-
holes
and
pieces
of
fret
-
work
in
the
spires
of
city
churches
,
as
if
with
golden
arrows
that
struck
through
and
through
them
---
and
far
away
athwart
the
river
and
its
flat
blanks
,
it
was
gleaming
like
a
path
of
fire
---
and
<EOS>
out
at
sea
it
was
irradiating
sails
of
ships
---
and
,
looked
towards
,
from
quiet
churchyards
,
upon
hill
-
tops
in
the
country
,
it
was
steeping
distant
prospects
in
a
flush
and
glow
that
seemed
to
mingle
earth
and
sky
together
in
one
glorious
suffusion
---
when
Florence
,
opening
her
heavy
eyes
,
lay
at
first
,
looking
without
interest
or
recognition
at
the
unfamiliar
walls
around
her
,
and
listening
in
the
same
regardless
manner
to
the
noises
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
But
presently
she
started
up
upon
her
couch
,
gazed
round
with
a
surprised
and
vacant
look
,
and
recollected
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
pretty
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
knocking
at
the
door
,
"
what
cheer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
friend
,
"
cried
Florence
,
hurrying
to
him
,
"
is
it
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
felt
so
much
pride
in
the
name
,
and
was
so
pleased
by
the
gleam
of
pleasure
in
her
face
,
<EOS>
when
she
saw
him
,
that
he
kissed
his
hook
,
by
way
of
reply
,
in
speechless
gratification
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
cheer
,
bright
di'mond
?
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
surely
slept
very
long
,
"
returned
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
When
did
I
come
here
?
<EOS>
Yesterday
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
here
blessed
day
,
my
lady
lass
,
"
replied
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
there
been
no
night
?
<EOS>
Is
it
still
day
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Getting
on
for
evening
now
,
my
pretty
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
drawing
back
the
curtain
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
See
!
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
,
with
her
hand
upon
the
Captain
's
arm
,
so
sorrowful
and
timid
,
and
the
Captain
with
his
rough
face
and
burly
figure
,
so
quietly
protective
of
her
,
stood
in
the
rosy
light
of
the
bright
evening
sky
,
without
saying
a
word
.
<EOS>
However
strange
the
form
of
speech
into
which
he
might
have
fashioned
the
feeling
,
if
he
had
had
to
give
it
utterance
,
the
Captain
felt
,
as
sensibly
as
the
most
eloquent
of
men
could
have
done
,
that
there
was
something
in
the
tranquil
time
and
in
its
softened
beauty
that
would
make
the
wounded
heart
of
Florence
overflow
;
and
that
it
was
better
that
such
tears
should
have
their
way
.
<EOS>
So
not
a
word
spake
Captain
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
felt
his
arm
clasped
closer
,
and
when
he
felt
the
lonely
head
come
nearer
to
it
,
and
lay
itself
against
his
homely
coarse
blue
sleeve
,
he
pressed
it
gently
with
his
rugged
hand
,
and
understood
it
,
and
was
understood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Better
now
,
my
pretty
!
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Cheerily
,
cheerily
;
I
'll
go
down
below
,
and
get
some
dinner
ready
.
<EOS>
Will
you
come
down
of
your
own
self
,
arterwards
,
pretty
,
or
shall
Ed'ard
<EOS>
Cuttle
come
and
fetch
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
As
Florence
assured
him
that
she
was
quite
able
to
walk
down
stairs
,
the
Captain
,
though
evidently
doubtful
of
his
own
hospitality
in
permitting
it
,
left
her
to
do
so
,
and
immediately
set
about
roasting
a
fowl
at
the
fire
in
the
little
parlour
.
<EOS>
To
achieve
his
cookery
with
the
greater
skill
,
he
pulled
off
his
coat
,
tucked
up
his
wristbands
,
and
put
on
his
glazed
hat
,
without
which
assistant
he
never
applied
himself
to
any
nice
or
difficult
undertaking
.
  
<EOS>
After
cooling
her
aching
head
and
burning
face
in
the
fresh
water
which
the
Captain
's
care
had
provided
for
her
while
she
slept
,
Florence
went
to
the
little
mirror
to
bind
up
her
disordered
hair
.
<EOS>
Then
she
knew
---
in
a
moment
,
for
she
shunned
it
instantly
---
that
on
her
breast
there
was
the
darkening
mark
of
any
angry
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Her
tears
burst
forth
afresh
at
the
sight
;
she
was
ashamed
and
afraid
of
it
;
but
it
moved
her
to
no
anger
against
him
.
<EOS>
Homeless
and
fatherless
<EOS>
,
she
forgave
him
everything
;
hardly
thought
that
she
had
need
to
forgive
him
,
or
that
she
did
;
but
she
fled
from
the
idea
of
him
as
she
had
fled
from
the
reality
,
and
he
was
utterly
gone
and
lost
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
such
Being
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
What
to
do
,
or
where
to
live
,
Florence
---
poor
,
inexperienced
girl
!
<EOS>
---
could
not
yet
consider
.
<EOS>
She
had
indistinct
dreams
of
finding
,
a
long
way
off
,
some
little
sisters
to
instruct
,
who
would
be
gentle
with
her
,
and
to
whom
,
under
some
feigned
name
,
she
might
attach
herself
,
and
who
would
grow
up
in
their
happy
home
,
and
marry
,
and
be
good
to
their
old
governess
,
and
perhaps
intrust
her
,
in
time
,
with
the
education
of
their
own
daughters
.
<EOS>
And
she
thought
how
strange
and
sorrowful
it
would
be
,
thus
to
become
a
grey
-
haired
woman
,
carrying
her
secret
to
the
grave
,
when
Florence
Dombey
was
forgotten
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
all
dim
and
clouded
to
her
now
.
<EOS>
She
only
knew
that
she
had
no
Father
upon
earth
,
and
she
said
so
,
many
times
,
with
her
suppliant
head
hidden
from
all
,
but
her
Father
who
was
in
Heaven
.
  
<EOS>
Her
little
stock
of
money
amounted
to
<EOS>
but
a
few
guineas
.
<EOS>
With
a
part
of
this
,
it
would
be
necessary
to
buy
some
clothes
,
for
she
had
none
but
those
she
wore
.
<EOS>
She
was
too
desolate
to
think
how
soon
her
money
would
be
gone
---
too
much
a
child
in
worldly
matters
to
be
greatly
troubled
on
that
score
yet
,
even
if
her
other
trouble
had
been
less
.
<EOS>
She
tried
to
calm
her
thoughts
and
stay
her
tears
;
to
quiet
the
hurry
in
her
throbbing
head
,
and
bring
herself
to
believe
that
what
had
happened
were
<EOS>
but
the
events
of
a
few
hours
ago
,
instead
of
weeks
or
months
,
as
they
appeared
;
and
went
down
to
her
kind
protector
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
had
spread
the
cloth
with
great
care
,
and
was
making
some
egg
-
sauce
in
a
little
saucepan
:
basting
the
fowl
from
time
to
time
during
the
process
with
a
strong
interest
,
as
it
turned
and
browned
on
a
string
before
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Having
propped
Florence
up
with
cushions
on
the
sofa
,
which
was
already
wheeled
into
a
warm
corner
for
her
greater
comfort
,
the
Captain
pursued
his
cooking
with
extraordinary
skill
,
making
hot
gravy
in
a
second
little
saucepan
,
boiling
a
handful
of
potatoes
in
a
third
,
never
forgetting
the
egg
-
sauce
in
the
first
,
and
making
an
impartial
round
of
basting
and
stirring
with
the
most
useful
of
spoons
every
minute
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
cares
,
the
Captain
had
to
keep
his
eye
on
a
diminutive
fryingpan
,
in
which
some
sausages
were
hissing
and
bubbling
in
a
most
musical
manner
;
and
there
was
never
such
a
radiant
cook
as
the
Captain
looked
,
in
the
height
and
heat
of
these
functions
:
it
being
impossible
to
say
whether
his
face
or
his
glazed
hat
shone
the
brighter
.
  
<EOS>
The
dinner
being
at
length
quite
ready
,
Captain
Cuttle
dished
and
served
it
up
,
with
no
less
dexterity
than
he
had
cooked
it
.
<EOS>
He
then
dressed
for
dinner
,
by
taking
off
his
glazed
hat
and
putting
on
his
coat
.
<EOS>
That
done
,
he
wheeled
the
table
close
against
Florence
on
the
sofa
,
said
grace
,
unscrewed
his
hook
,
screwed
his
fork
into
its
place
,
and
did
the
honours
of
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lady
lass
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
cheer
up
,
and
try
to
eat
a
deal
.
<EOS>
Stand
by
,
my
deary
!
<EOS>
Liver
wing
it
is
.
<EOS>
Sarse
it
is
.
<EOS>
Sassage
it
is
.
<EOS>
And
potato
!
"
<EOS>
all
which
the
Captain
ranged
symmetrically
on
a
plate
,
and
pouring
hot
gravy
on
the
whole
with
the
useful
spoon
,
set
before
his
cherished
guest
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
whole
row
o
'
dead
lights
is
up
,
for'ard
,
lady
lass
,
"
observed
the
Captain
,
encouragingly
,
"
and
everything
is
made
snug
.
<EOS>
Try
and
pick
a
bit
,
my
pretty

If
Wal'r
was
here
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
If
I
had
him
for
my
brother
now
!
"
cried
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
!
<EOS>
do
n't
take
on
,
my
pretty
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
awast
to
obleege
me
!
<EOS>
He
was
your
nat'ral
born
friend
like
,
warn't
he
,
Pet
?
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
had
no
words
to
answer
with
.
<EOS>
She
only
said
,
"
Oh
,
dear
,
dear
Paul
!
<EOS>
oh
,
Walter
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
wery
planks
she
walked
on
,
"
murmured
the
Captain
,
looking
at
her
drooping
face
,
"
was
as
high
esteemed
by
Wal'r
,
as
the
water
brooks
is
by
the
hart
which
never
rejices
!
<EOS>
I
see
him
now
,
the
wery
day
as
he
was
rated
on
them
<EOS>
Dombey
books
,
a
speaking
of
her
with
his
face
a
glistening
with
doo
---
leastways
with
his
modest
sentiments
<EOS>
---
like
a
new
blowed
rose
,
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
<EOS>
If
our
poor
Wal'r
was
here
,
my
lady
lass
---
<EOS>
or
if
he
could
be
---
for
he
's
drownded
,
<EOS>
an't
he
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
shook
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
;
drownded
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
soothingly
;
"
as
I
was
saying
,
if
he
could
be
here
he
'd
beg
and
pray
of
you
,
<EOS>
my
precious
,
to
pick
a
leetle
bit
,
with
a
look
-
out
for
your
own
sweet
health
.
<EOS>
Whereby
,
hold
your
own
,
my
lady
lass
,
as
if
it
was
for
Wal'r
's
sake
,
and
lay
your
pretty
head
to
the
wind
.
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
essayed
to
eat
a
morsel
,
for
the
Captain
's
pleasure
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
meanwhile
,
who
seemed
to
have
quite
forgotten
his
own
dinner
,
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
drew
his
chair
to
the
sofa
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wal'r
was
a
trim
lad
,
warn't
<EOS>
he
,
precious
?
"
said
the
Captain
,
after
sitting
for
some
time
silently
rubbing
his
chin
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
,
"
and
a
brave
lad
,
and
a
good
lad
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
tearfully
assented
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
's
drownded
,
Beauty
,
an't
he
?
"
said
the
Captain
,
in
a
soothing
voice
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
could
not
but
assent
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
older
than
you
,
my
lady
lass
,
"
pursued
the
Captain
,
"
but
you
was
like
two
children
together
,
at
first
;
<EOS>
warn't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
answered
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
Wal'r
's
drownded
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
An't
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
repetition
of
this
inquiry
was
a
curious
source
of
consolation
,
but
it
seemed
to
be
one
to
Captain
Cuttle
,
for
he
came
back
to
it
again
and
again
.
<EOS>
Florence
,
fain
to
push
from
her
her
untasted
dinner
,
and
to
lie
back
on
her
sofa
,
gave
him
her
hand
,
feeling
that
she
had
disappointed
him
,
though
truly
wishing
to
have
pleased
him
after
all
his
trouble
,
but
he
held
it
in
his
own
(
which
shook
as
he
held
it
)
,
and
appearing
to
have
quite
forgotten
all
about
the
dinner
and
her
want
of
appetite
,
went
on
growling
at
intervals
,
in
a
ruminating
tone
of
sympathy
,
"
Poor
Wal'r
.
<EOS>
Aye
,
aye
!
<EOS>
Drownded
.
<EOS>
An't
he
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
always
waited
for
her
answer
,
in
which
the
great
point
of
these
singular
reflections
appeared
to
consist
.
  
<EOS>
The
fowl
and
sausages
were
cold
,
and
the
gravy
and
the
egg
-
sauce
stagnant
,
before
the
Captain
remembered
that
they
were
on
the
board
,
and
fell
to
with
the
assistance
of
Diogenes
,
whose
united
efforts
quickly
dispatched
the
banquet
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
's
delight
and
wonder
at
the
quiet
housewifery
of
Florence
in
assisting
to
clear
the
table
,
arrange
the
parlour
,
and
sweep
up
the
hearth
---
only
to
be
equalled
by
the
fervency
of
his
protest
when
she
began
to
assist
him
---
were
gradually
raised
to
that
degree
,
that
at
last
he
could
not
choose
but
do
nothing
himself
,
and
stand
looking
at
her
as
if
she
were
some
Fairy
,
daintily
performing
these
offices
for
him
;
the
red
rim
on
his
forehead
glowing
again
,
in
his
unspeakable
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
Florence
,
taking
down
his
pipe
from
the
mantelshelf
gave
it
into
his
hand
,
and
entreated
him
to
smoke
it
,
the
good
Captain
was
so
bewildered
by
her
attention
that
he
held
it
as
if
he
had
never
held
a
pipe
in
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
Likewise
,
when
Florence
,
looking
into
the
little
cupboard
,
took
out
the
casebottle
and
mixed
a
perfect
glass
of
grog
for
him
,
unasked
,
and
set
it
at
his
elbow
,
his
ruddy
nose
turned
pale
,
he
felt
himself
so
graced
and
honoured
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
filled
his
pipe
in
an
absolute
reverie
of
satisfaction
,
Florence
lighted
it
for
him
---
the
Captain
having
no
power
to
object
,
or
to
prevent
her
---
and
resuming
her
place
on
the
old
sofa
,
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
so
loving
and
so
grateful
,
a
smile
that
showed
him
so
plainly
how
her
forlorn
heart
turned
to
him
,
as
her
face
did
,
through
grief
,
that
the
smoke
of
the
pipe
got
into
the
Captain
's
throat
and
made
him
cough
,
and
got
into
the
Captain
's
eyes
,
and
made
them
blink
and
water
.
  
<EOS>
The
manner
in
which
the
Captain
tried
to
make
believe
that
the
cause
of
these
effects
lay
hidden
in
the
pipe
itself
,
and
the
way
in
which
he
looked
into
the
bowl
for
it
,
and
not
finding
it
there
,
pretended
to
blow
it
out
of
the
stem
,
was
wonderfully
pleasant
.
<EOS>
The
pipe
soon
getting
into
better
condition
,
he
fell
into
that
state
of
repose
becoming
a
good
smoker
;
but
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
Florence
,
and
,
with
a
beaming
placidity
not
to
be
described
,
and
stopping
every
now
and
then
to
discharge
a
little
cloud
from
his
lips
,
slowly
puffed
it
forth
,
as
if
it
were
a
scroll
coming
out
of
his
mouth
,
bearing
the
legend
<EOS>
"
Poor
Wal'r
,
aye
,
aye
.
<EOS>
Drownded
,
an't
he
?
"
<EOS>
after
which
he
would
resume
his
smoking
with
infinite
gentleness
.
  
<EOS>
Unlike
as
they
were
externally
---
and
there
could
scarcely
be
a
more
decided
contrast
than
between
Florence
in
her
delicate
youth
and
beauty
,
and
Captain
Cuttle
with
his
knobby
face
,
his
great
broad
weather
-
beaten
person
,
and
his
gruff
voice
---
in
simple
innocence
of
the
world
's
ways
and
the
world
's
perplexities
and
dangers
,
they
were
nearly
on
a
level
.
<EOS>
No
child
could
have
surpassed
Captain
Cuttle
in
inexperience
of
everything
but
wind
and
weather
;
in
simplicity
,
credulity
,
and
generous
trustfulness
.
<EOS>
Faith
,
hope
,
and
charity
,
shared
his
whole
nature
among
them
.
<EOS>
An
odd
sort
of
romance
,
perfectly
unimaginative
,
yet
perfectly
unreal
,
and
subject
to
no
considerations
of
worldly
prudence
or
practicability
,
was
the
only
partner
they
had
in
his
character
.
<EOS>
As
the
Captain
sat
,
and
smoked
,
and
looked
at
Florence
,
God
knows
what
impossible
pictures
,
in
which
she
was
the
principal
figure
,
presented
themselves
to
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Equally
vague
and
uncertain
,
though
not
so
sanguine
,
were
her
own
thoughts
of
the
life
before
her
;
and
even
as
her
tears
made
prismatic
colours
in
the
light
she
gazed
at
so
,
through
her
new
and
heavy
grief
,
she
already
saw
a
rainbow
faintly
shining
in
the
far
-
off
sky
.
<EOS>
A
wandering
princess
and
a
good
monster
in
a
story
-
book
might
have
sat
by
the
fireside
,
and
talked
as
Captain
Cuttle
and
poor
Florence
thought
---
and
not
have
looked
very
much
unlike
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
was
not
troubled
with
the
faintest
idea
of
any
difficulty
in
retaining
Florence
,
or
of
any
responsibility
thereby
incurred
.
<EOS>
Having
put
up
the
shutters
and
locked
the
door
,
he
was
quite
satisfied
on
this
head
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
been
a
Ward
in
Chancery
,
it
would
have
made
no
difference
at
all
to
Captain
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
be
troubled
by
any
such
considerations
.
  
<EOS>
So
the
Captain
smoked
his
pipe
very
comfortably
,
and
Florence
and
he
meditated
after
their
own
manner
.
<EOS>
When
the
pipe
was
out
,
they
had
some
tea
;
and
then
Florence
entreated
him
to
take
her
to
some
neighbouring
shop
,
where
she
could
buy
the
few
necessaries
she
immediately
wanted
.
<EOS>
It
being
quite
dark
,
the
Captain
consented
;
peeping
carefully
out
first
,
as
he
had
been
wo
nt
to
do
in
his
time
of
hiding
from
Mrs
MacStinger
;
and
arming
himself
with
his
large
stick
,
in
case
of
an
appeal
to
arms
being
rendered
necessary
by
any
unforeseen
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
The
pride
Captain
Cuttle
had
,
in
giving
his
arm
to
Florence
,
and
escorting
her
some
two
or
three
hundred
yards
,
keeping
a
bright
look
-
out
all
the
time
,
and
attracting
the
attention
of
every
one
who
passed
them
,
by
his
great
vigilance
and
numerous
precautions
,
was
extreme
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
shop
,
the
Captain
felt
it
a
point
of
delicacy
to
retire
during
the
making
of
the
purchases
,
as
they
were
to
consist
of
wearing
apparel
;
but
he
previously
deposited
his
tin
canister
on
the
counter
,
and
informing
the
young
lady
of
the
establishment
that
it
contained
fourteen
pound
two
,
requested
her
,
in
case
that
amount
of
property
should
not
be
sufficient
to
defray
the
expenses
of
his
niece
's
little
outfit
---
at
the
word
"
niece
,
"
he
bestowed
a
most
significant
look
on
Florence
,
accompanied
with
pantomime
,
expressive
of
sagacity
and
mystery
---
to
have
the
goodness
to
"
sing
out
,
"
and
he
would
make
up
the
difference
from
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
Casually
consulting
his
big
watch
,
as
a
deep
means
of
dazzling
the
establishment
,
and
impressing
it
with
a
sense
of
property
,
the
Captain
then
kissed
his
hook
to
his
niece
,
and
retired
outside
the
window
,
where
it
was
a
choice
sight
to
see
his
great
face
looking
in
from
time
to
time
,
among
the
silks
and
ribbons
,
with
an
obvious
misgiving
that
Florence
had
been
spirited
away
by
a
back
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
said
Florence
,
when
she
came
out
with
a
parcel
,
the
size
of
which
greatly
disappointed
the
Captain
,
who
had
expected
to
see
a
porter
following
with
a
bale
of
goods
,
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
this
money
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
spent
any
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
money
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lady
lass
,
"
returned
the
baffled
Captain
,
looking
straight
down
the
street
before
them
,
"
take
care
on
it
for
me
<EOS>
,
will
you
be
so
good
,
till
such
time
as
I
ask
ye
for
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
put
it
back
in
its
usual
place
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
and
keep
it
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
was
not
at
all
gratified
by
this
proposal
,
but
he
answered
,
"
<EOS>
Aye
,
aye
,
put
it
anywheres
,
my
lady
lass
,
so
long
as
you
know
where
to
find
it
again
.
<EOS>
It
an't
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
no
use
to
me
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
I
have
n't
chucked
it
away
afore
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
was
quite
disheartened
for
the
moment
,
but
he
revived
at
the
first
touch
of
Florence
's
arm
,
and
they
returned
with
the
same
precautions
as
they
had
come
;
the
Captain
opening
the
door
of
the
little
Midshipman
's
berth
,
and
diving
in
,
with
a
suddenness
which
his
great
practice
only
could
have
taught
him
.
<EOS>
During
Florence
's
slumber
in
the
morning
,
he
had
engaged
the
daughter
of
an
elderly
lady
,
who
usually
sat
under
a
blue
umbrella
in
Leadenhall
Market
,
selling
poultry
,
to
come
and
put
her
room
in
order
,
and
render
her
any
little
services
she
required
;
and
this
damsel
now
appearing
,
Florence
found
everything
about
her
as
convenient
and
orderly
,
if
not
as
handsome
,
as
in
the
terrible
dream
she
had
once
called
Home
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
were
alone
again
,
the
Captain
insisted
on
her
eating
a
slice
of
dry
toast
,
and
drinking
a
glass
of
spiced
negus
(
which
he
made
to
perfection
)
;
and
,
encouraging
her
with
every
kind
word
and
inconsequential
quotation
he
could
possibly
think
of
,
led
her
upstairs
to
her
bedroom
.
<EOS>
But
he
too
had
something
on
his
mind
,
and
was
not
easy
in
his
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
dear
heart
,
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
to
her
at
her
chamber
-
door
.
   
<EOS>
Florence
raised
his
lips
to
his
face
,
and
kissed
him
.
  
<EOS>
At
any
other
time
the
Captain
would
have
been
overbalanced
by
such
a
token
of
her
affection
and
gratitude
;
but
now
,
although
he
was
very
sensible
of
it
,
he
looked
in
her
face
with
even
more
uneasiness
than
he
had
testified
before
,
and
seemed
unwilling
to
leave
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Wal'r
!
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
,
poor
Walter
!
<EOS>
"
sighed
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Drownded
,
an't
he
?
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
shook
her
head
,
and
sighed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
my
lady
lass
!
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
,
putting
out
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
dear
,
kind
friend
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
Captain
lingered
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
anything
the
matter
,
dear
Captain
Cuttle
?
"
said
Florence
,
easily
alarmed
in
her
then
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
anything
to
tell
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
tell
you
,
lady
lass
!
"
replied
the
Captain
,
meeting
her
eyes
in
confusion
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
;
what
should
I
have
to
tell
you
,
pretty
!
<EOS>
You
do
n't
expect
as
I
've
got
anything
good
to
tell
you
,
sure
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Florence
,
shaking
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
looked
at
her
wistfully
,
and
repeated
"
No
,
"
---
still
lingering
,
and
still
showing
embarrassment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Wal'r
!
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
My
Wal'r
,
as
I
used
to
call
you
!
<EOS>
Old
Sol
Gills
's
nevy
!
<EOS>
Welcome
to
all
as
knowed
you
,
as
the
flowers
in
May
!
<EOS>
Where
are
you
got
to
,
brave
boy
?
<EOS>
Drownded
,
an't
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
Concluding
his
apostrophe
with
this
abrupt
appeal
to
Florence
,
the
Captain
bade
her
good
night
,
and
descended
the
stairs
,
while
Florence
remained
at
the
top
,
holding
the
candle
out
to
light
him
down
.
<EOS>
He
was
lost
in
the
obscurity
,
and
,
judging
from
the
sound
of
his
receding
footsteps
,
was
in
the
act
of
turning
into
the
little
parlour
,
when
his
head
and
shoulders
unexpectedly
emerged
again
,
as
from
the
deep
,
apparently
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
repeat
,
"
Drownded
,
an't
<EOS>
he
,
pretty
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
when
he
had
said
that
in
a
tone
of
tender
condolence
,
he
disappeared
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
was
very
sorry
that
she
should
unwittingly
,
though
naturally
,
have
awakened
these
associations
in
the
mind
of
her
protector
,
by
taking
refuge
there
;
and
sitting
down
before
the
little
table
where
the
Captain
had
arranged
the
telescope
and
song
-
book
,
and
those
other
rarities
,
thought
of
Walter
,
and
of
all
that
was
connected
with
him
in
the
past
,
until
she
could
have
almost
wished
to
lie
down
on
her
bed
and
fade
away
.
<EOS>
But
in
her
lonely
yearning
to
the
dead
whom
she
had
loved
,
no
thought
of
home
---
no
possibility
of
going
back
---
no
presentation
of
it
as
yet
existing
,
or
as
sheltering
her
father
---
once
entered
her
thoughts
.
<EOS>
She
had
seen
the
murder
done
.
<EOS>
In
the
last
lingering
natural
aspect
in
which
she
had
cherished
him
through
so
much
,
he
had
been
torn
out
of
her
heart
,
defaced
,
and
slain
.
<EOS>
The
thought
of
it
was
so
appalling
to
her
,
that
she
covered
her
eyes
,
and
shrunk
trembling
from
the
least
remembrance
of
the
deed
,
or
of
the
cruel
hand
that
did
it
.
<EOS>
If
her
fond
heart
could
have
held
his
image
after
that
,
it
must
have
broken
;
but
it
could
not
;
and
the
void
was
filled
with
a
wild
dread
that
fled
from
all
confronting
with
its
shattered
fragments
---
with
such
a
dread
as
could
have
risen
out
of
nothing
but
the
depths
of
such
a
love
,
so
wronged
.
  
<EOS>
She
dared
not
look
into
the
glass
;
for
the
sight
of
the
darkening
mark
upon
her
bosom
made
her
afraid
of
herself
,
as
if
she
bore
about
her
something
wicked
.
<EOS>
She
covered
it
up
,
with
a
hasty
,
faltering
hand
,
and
in
the
dark
;
and
laid
her
weary
head
down
,
weeping
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
did
not
go
to
bed
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
He
walked
to
and
fro
in
the
shop
and
in
the
little
parlour
,
for
a
full
hour
,
and
,
appearing
to
have
composed
himself
by
that
exercise
,
sat
down
with
a
grave
and
thoughtful
face
,
and
read
out
of
a
Prayer
-
book
<EOS>
the
forms
of
prayer
appointed
to
be
used
at
sea
.
<EOS>
These
were
not
easily
disposed
of
;
the
good
Captain
being
a
mighty
slow
,
gruff
reader
,
and
frequently
stopping
at
a
hard
word
to
give
himself
such
encouragement
as
"
Now
,
my
lad!With
a
will
!
"
<EOS>
or
,
"
Steady
,
Ed'ard
Cuttle
,
steady
!
"
which
had
a
great
effect
in
helping
him
out
of
any
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
his
spectacles
greatly
interfered
with
his
powers
of
vision
.
<EOS>
But
notwithstanding
these
drawbacks
,
the
Captain
,
being
heartily
in
earnest
,
read
the
service
to
the
very
last
line
,
and
with
genuine
feeling
too
;
and
approving
of
it
very
much
when
he
had
done
,
turned
in
under
the
counter
(
but
not
before
he
had
been
upstairs
,
and
listened
at
Florence
's
door
)
,
with
a
serene
breast
,
and
a
most
benevolent
visage
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
turned
out
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
night
,
to
assure
himself
that
his
charge
was
resting
quietly
;
and
once
,
at
daybreak
,
found
that
she
was
awake
:
for
she
called
to
know
if
it
were
he
,
on
hearing
footsteps
near
her
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
lady
lass
,
"
replied
the
Captain
,
in
a
growling
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Are
you
all
right
,
di'mond
?
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
thanked
him
,
and
said
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
could
not
lose
so
favourable
an
opportunity
of
applying
his
mouth
to
the
keyhole
,
and
calling
through
it
,
like
a
hoarse
breeze
,
"
Poor
Wal'r
!
<EOS>
Drownded
,
an't
he
?
"
<EOS>
After
which
he
withdrew
,
and
turning
in
again
,
slept
till
seven
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
free
from
his
uneasy
and
embarrassed
manner
all
that
day
;
though
Florence
,
being
busy
with
her
needle
in
the
little
parlour
,
was
more
calm
and
tranquil
than
she
had
been
on
the
day
preceding
.
<EOS>
Almost
always
when
she
raised
her
eyes
from
her
work
,
she
observed
the
Captain
looking
at
her
,
and
thoughtfully
stroking
his
chin
;
and
he
so
often
hitched
his
arm
-
chair
close
to
her
,
as
if
he
were
going
to
say
something
very
confidential
,
and
hitched
it
away
again
,
as
not
being
able
to
make
up
his
mind
how
to
begin
,
that
in
the
course
of
the
day
he
cruised
completely
round
the
parlour
in
that
frail
bark
,
and
more
than
once
went
ashore
against
the
wainscot
or
the
closet
door
,
in
a
very
distressed
condition
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
the
twilight
that
Captain
Cuttle
,
fairly
dropping
anchor
,
at
last
,
by
the
side
of
Florence
,
began
to
talk
at
all
connectedly
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
light
of
the
fire
was
shining
on
the
walls
and
ceiling
of
the
little
room
,
and
on
the
teaboard
and
the
cups
and
saucers
that
were
ranged
upon
the
table
,
and
on
her
calm
face
turned
towards
the
flame
,
and
reflecting
it
in
the
tears
that
filled
her
eyes
,
the
Captain
broke
a
long
silence
thus
:
  
"
You
never
was
at
sea
,
my
own
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
reverentially
;
"
it
's
a
almighty
element
.
<EOS>
There
's
wonders
in
the
deep
,
my
pretty
.
<EOS>
Think
on
it
when
the
winds
is
roaring
and
the
waves
is
rowling
.
<EOS>
Think
on
it
when
the
stormy
nights
is
so
pitch
dark
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
solemnly
holding
up
his
hook
,
"
as
you
ca
n't
see
your
hand
afore
you
,
excepting
when
the
wiwid
lightning
reweals
the
same
;
and
when
you
drive
,
drive
,
drive
through
the
storm
and
dark
,
as
if
you
was
a
driving
,
head
on
,
to
the
world
without
end
,
evermore
,
amen
,
and
when
found
making
a
note
of
.
<EOS>
Them
's
the
times
,
my
beauty
,
when
a
man
may
say
to
his
messmate
(
previously
a
overhauling
of
the
wollume
)
,
<EOS>
"
A
stiff
nor'wester
's
blowing
,
Bill
;
hark
do
n't
you
hear
it
roar
now
!
<EOS>
Lord
help
'em
,
how
I
pitys
all
unhappy
folks
ashore
now
!
"
<EOS>
"
Which
quotation
,
as
particularly
applicable
to
the
terrors
of
the
ocean
,
the
Captain
delivered
in
a
most
impressive
manner
,
concluding
with
a
sonorous
"
Stand
by
!
"
  
"
Were
you
ever
in
a
dreadful
storm
?
"
asked
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
aye
,
my
lady
lass
,
I
've
seen
my
share
of
bad
weather
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
tremulously
wiping
his
head
,
"
and
I
've
had
my
share
of
knocking
about
;
but
<EOS>
---
but
it
an't
myself
as
I
was
a
meaning
to
speak
.
<EOS>
Our
dear
boy
,
"
drawing
closer
to
her
,
"
Wal'r
,
darling
,
as
was
drownded
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
spoke
in
such
a
trembling
voice
,
and
looked
at
Florence
with
a
face
so
pale
and
agitated
,
that
she
clung
to
his
hand
in
affright
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
face
is
changed
,
"
cried
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
altered
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
What
is
it
?
<EOS>
Dear
Captain
Cuttle
,
it
turns
me
cold
to
see
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
Lady
lass
,
"
returned
the
Captain
,
supporting
her
with
his
hand
,
"
do
n't
be
took
aback
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
<EOS>
All
's
well
<EOS>
,
all
's
well
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
As
I
was
a
saying
---
Wal'r
---
<EOS>
he
's
---
he
's
drownded
.
<EOS>
An't
he
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
looked
at
him
intently
;
her
colour
came
and
went
;
and
she
laid
her
hand
upon
her
breast
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
perils
and
dangers
on
the
deep
,
my
beauty
,
"
said
the
Captain
;
"
and
over
many
a
brave
ship
,
and
many
and
many
a
bould
heart
,
the
secret
waters
has
closed
up
,
and
never
told
no
tales
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
escapes
upon
the
deep
,
too
,
and
sometimes
one
man
out
of
a
score
,
---
ah
!
<EOS>
maybe
out
of
a
hundred
,
pretty
,
---
has
been
saved
by
the
mercy
of
God
,
and
come
home
after
being
given
over
for
dead
,
and
told
of
all
hands
lost
.
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
know
a
story
,
Heart
's
Delight
,
"
stammered
the
Captain
,
"
o
'
<EOS>
this
natur
,
as
was
told
to
me
once
;
and
being
on
this
here
tack
,
and
you
and
me
sitting
alone
by
the
fire
,
maybe
you
'd
like
to
hear
me
tell
it
.
<EOS>
Would
you
,
deary
?
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
,
trembling
with
an
agitation
which
she
could
not
control
or
understand
,
involuntarily
followed
his
glance
,
which
went
behind
her
into
the
shop
,
where
a
lamp
was
burning
.
<EOS>
The
instant
that
she
turned
her
head
,
the
Captain
sprung
out
of
his
chair
,
and
interposed
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
there
,
my
beauty
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
look
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
asked
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
murmured
something
about
its
being
dull
that
way
,
and
about
the
fire
being
cheerful
.
<EOS>
He
drew
the
door
ajar
,
which
had
been
standing
open
until
now
,
and
resumed
his
seat
.
<EOS>
Florence
followed
him
with
her
eyes
,
and
looked
intently
in
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
story
was
about
a
ship
,
my
lady
lass
,
"
began
the
Captain
,
"
as
sailed
out
of
the
Port
of
London
,
with
a
fair
wind
and
in
fair
weather
,
bound
for
---
do
n't
be
took
aback
,
my
lady
lass
,
she
was
only
out'ard
bound
,
pretty
,
only
out'ard
bound
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
expression
on
Florence
's
face
alarmed
the
Captain
,
who
was
himself
very
hot
and
flurried
,
and
showed
scarcely
less
agitation
than
she
did
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
go
on
,
Beauty
?
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
pray
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
made
a
gulp
as
if
to
get
down
something
that
was
sticking
in
his
throat
,
and
nervously
proceeded
:
  
"
That
there
unfort'nate
ship
met
with
such
foul
weather
,
out
at
sea
,
as
do
n't
blow
once
in
twenty
year
,
my
darling
.
<EOS>
There
was
hurricanes
ashore
as
tore
up
forests
and
blowed
down
towns
,
and
there
was
gales
at
sea
in
them
latitudes
,
as
not
the
stoutest
wessel
ever
launched
could
live
in
.
<EOS>
Day
arter
day
that
there
unfort'nate
ship
behaved
noble
,
I
'm
told
,
and
did
her
duty
brave
,
my
pretty
,
but
at
one
blow
a'most
her
bulwarks
was
stove
in
,
her
masts
and
rudder
carried
away
,
her
best
men
swept
overboard
,
and
she
left
to
the
mercy
of
the
storm
as
had
no
mercy
but
blowed
harder
and
harder
yet
,
while
the
waves
dashed
over
her
,
and
beat
her
in
,
and
every
time
they
come
a
thundering
at
her
,
broke
her
like
a
shell
.
<EOS>
Every
black
spot
in
every
mountain
of
water
that
rolled
away
was
a
bit
o
'
the
ship
's
life
or
a
living
man
,
and
so
she
went
to
pieces
,
Beauty
,
and
no
grass
will
never
grow
upon
the
graves
of
them
as
manned
that
ship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
were
not
all
lost
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
Some
were
saved
!
<EOS>
---
Was
one
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aboard
o
'
that
there
unfort'nate
wessel
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
rising
from
his
chair
,
and
clenching
his
hand
with
prodigious
energy
and
exultation
,
"
was
a
lad
,
a
gallant
lad
---
<EOS>
as
I
've
heerd
tell

that
had
loved
,
when
he
was
a
boy
,
to
read
and
talk
about
brave
actions
in
shipwrecks
---
I
've
heerd
him
!
<EOS>
I
've
heerd
him
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
he
remembered
of
'em
in
his
hour
of
need
;
for
when
the
stoutest
hearts
and
oldest
hands
was
hove
down
,
he
was
firm
and
cheery
.
<EOS>
It
warn't
<EOS>
the
want
of
objects
to
like
and
love
ashore
that
gave
him
courage
,
it
was
his
nat'ral
mind
.
<EOS>
I
've
seen
it
in
his
face
,
when
he
was
no
more
than
a
child
---
aye
,
many
a
time

<EOS>
and
when
I
thought
it
nothing

his
good

him

<EOS>
"
And
was
he
saved

<EOS>

Florence
had
hardly

Because

arter
working

by

hearted

keeping
up
a
spirit

him

that

with

one

of

the

"
  
<EOS>
"
Were
they

cried
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Days
and
nights
they
drifted
on
them
endless
waters

said
the
Captain
,
"
until
at
last
---
No

<EOS>
Do

pretty

<EOS>

sail

<EOS>
cried
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not

said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
God

<EOS>
oh
thank
God

"
  
<EOS>
"
Amen

"
returned
the
Captain
hurriedly
.
<EOS>
"
Do

took
aback

<EOS>
A
minute
more
,
my
lady
lass
!
<EOS>
with
a
good
heart

<EOS>
---
aboard
that
ship
,
they
went
a
long
voyage
,
right
away
across
the
chart
(
for
there
warn't
<EOS>
no
touching
nowhere
)
,
and
on
that
voyage
the
seaman
as
was
picked
up
with
dim
died
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
spared
,
and
"
  
The
Captain
,
without
knowing
what
he
did
,
had
cut
a
slice
of
bread
from
the
loaf
,
and
put
it
on
his
hook
(
which
was
his
usual
toasting
-
fork
)
,
on
which
he
now
held
it
to
the
fire
;
looking
behind
Florence
with
great
emotion
in
his
face
,
and
suffering
the
bread
to
blaze
and
burn
like
fuel
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
spared
,
"
repeated
Florence
,
"
and
?
"
   
"
And
come
home
in
that
ship
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
still
looking
in
the
same
direction
,
"
and
---
do
n't
be
frightened
,
pretty
---
and
landed
;
and
one
morning
come
cautiously
to
his
own
door
to
take
a
obserwation
,
knowing
that
his
friends
would
think
him
drownded
,
when
he
sheered
off
at
<EOS>
the
unexpected
"
   
"
At
the
unexpected
barking
of
a
dog
?
"
cried
Florence
quickly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
roared
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
Steady
,
darling
!
<EOS>
courage!Don't
look
round
yet
.
<EOS>
See
there
!
<EOS>
upon
the
wall
!
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
the
shadow
of
a
man
upon
the
wall
close
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
started
up
,
looked
round
,
and
with
a
piercing
cry
,
saw
Walter
Gay
behind
her
!
  
<EOS>
She
had
no
thought
of
him
<EOS>
but
as
a
brother
,
a
brother
rescued
from
the
grave
;
a
shipwrecked
brother
saved
and
at
her
side
;
and
rushed
into
his
arms
.
<EOS>
In
all
the
world
,
he
seemed
to
be
her
hope
,
her
comfort
,
refuge
,
natural
protector
.
"
<EOS>
Take
care
of
Walter
,
I
was
fond
of
Walter
!
"
<EOS>
The
dear
remembrance
of
the
plaintive
voice
that
said
so
,
rushed
upon
her
soul
,
like
music
in
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
welcome
home
,
dear
Walter
!
<EOS>
Welcome
to
this
stricken
breast
!
"
<EOS>
She
felt
the
words
,
although
she
could
not
utter
them
,
and
held
him
in
her
pure
embrace
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
in
a
fit
of
delirium
,
attempted
to
wipe
his
head
with
the
blackened
toast
upon
his
hook
:
and
finding
it
an
uncongenial
substance
for
the
purpose
,
put
it
into
the
crown
of
his
glazed
hat
,
put
the
glazed
hat
on
with
some
difficulty
,
essayed
to
sing
a
verse
of
Lovely
Peg
,
broke
down
at
the
first
word
,
and
retired
into
the
shop
,
whence
he
presently
came
back
,
express
,
with
a
face
all
flushed
and
besmeared
,
and
the
starch
completely
taken
out
of
his
shirt
-
collar
,
to
say
these
words
:
  
"
Wal'r
,
my
lad
,
here
is
a
little
bit
of
property
as
I
should
wish
to
make
over
,
jintly
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
hastily
produced
the
big
watch
,
the
teaspoons
,
the
sugar
-
tongs
,
and
the
canister
,
and
laying
them
on
the
table
,
swept
them
with
his
great
hand
into
Walter
's
hat
;
but
in
handing
that
singular
strong
box
to
Walter
,
he
was
so
overcome
again
,
that
he
was
fain
to
make
another
retreat
into
the
shop
,
and
absent
himself
for
a
longer
space
of
time
than
on
his
first
retirement
.
  
<EOS>
But
Walter
sought
him
out
,
and
brought
him
back
;
and
then
the
Captain
's
great
apprehension
was
,
that
Florence
would
suffer
from
this
new
shock
.
<EOS>
He
felt
it
so
earnestly
,
that
he
turned
quite
rational
,
and
positively
interdicted
any
further
allusion
to
Walter
's
adventures
for
some
days
to
come
.
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
then
became
sufficiently
composed
to
relieve
himself
of
the
toast
in
his
hat
,
and
to
take
his
place
at
the
teaboard
;
but
finding
Walter
's
grasp
upon
his
shoulder
,
on
one
side
,
and
Florence
whispering
her
tearful
congratulations
on
the
other
,
the
Captain
suddenly
bolted
again
,
and
was
missing
for
a
good
ten
minutes
.
  
<EOS>
But
never
in
all
his
life
had
the
Captain
's
face
<EOS>
so
shone
and
glistened
<EOS>
,
as
when
,
at
last
,
he
sat
stationary
at
the
tea
-
board
,
looking
from
Florence
to
Walter
,
and
from
Walter
to
Florence
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
effect
produced
or
at
all
heightened
by
the
immense
quantity
of
polishing
he
had
administered
to
his
face
with
his
coat
-
sleeve
during
the
last
half
-
hour
.
<EOS>
It
was
solely
the
effect
of
his
internal
emotions
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
glory
and
delight
within
the
Captain
that
spread
itself
over
his
whole
visage
,
and
made
a
perfect
illumination
there
.
  
<EOS>
The
Pride
with
which
the
Captain
looked
upon
the
bronzed
cheek
and
the
courageous
eyes
of
his
recovered
boy
;
with
which
he
saw
the
generous
fervour
of
his
youth
,
and
all
its
frank
and
hopeful
qualities
,
shining
once
more
,
in
the
fresh
,
wholesome
manner
,
and
the
ardent
face
,
would
have
kindled
something
of
this
light
in
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
The
admiration
and
sympathy
with
which
he
turned
his
eyes
on
Florence
,
whose
beauty
,
grace
,
and
innocence
could
have
won
no
truer
or
more
zealous
champion
than
himself
,
would
have
had
an
equal
influence
upon
him
.
<EOS>
But
the
fulness
of
the
glow
he
shed
around
him
could
only
have
been
engendered
in
his
contemplation
of
the
two
together
,
and
in
all
the
fancies
springing
out
of
that
association
,
that
came
sparkling
and
beaming
into
his
head
,
and
danced
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
How
they
talked
of
poor
old
Uncle
Sol
,
and
dwelt
on
every
little
circumstance
relating
to
his
disappearance
;
how
their
joy
was
moderated
by
the
old
man
's
absence
and
by
the
misfortunes
of
Florence
;
how
they
released
Diogenes
,
whom
the
Captain
had
decoyed
upstairs
some
time
before
,
lest
he
should
bark
again
;
the
Captain
,
though
he
was
in
one
continual
flutter
,
and
made
many
more
short
plunges
into
the
shop
,
fully
comprehended
.
<EOS>
But
he
no
more
dreamed
that
Walter
looked
on
Florence
,
as
it
were
,
from
a
new
and
far
-
off
place
;
that
while
his
eyes
often
sought
the
lovely
face
,
they
seldom
met
its
open
glance
of
sisterly
affection
,
but
withdrew
themselves
when
hers
were
raised
towards
him
;
than
be
believed
that
it
was
Walter
's
ghost
who
sat
beside
him
.
<EOS>
He
saw
them
there
together
in
their
youth
and
beauty
,
and
he
knew
the
story
of
their
younger
days
,
and
he
had
no
inch
of
room
beneath
his
great
blue
waistcoat
for
anything
save
admiration
of
such
a
pair
,
and
gratitude
for
their
being
reunited
.
  
<EOS>
They
sat
thus
,
until
it
grew
late
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
would
have
been
content
to
sit
so
for
a
week
.
<EOS>
But
Walter
rose
,
to
take
leave
for
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Going
,
Walter
!
"
said
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
slings
his
hammock
for
the
present
,
lady
lass
,
"
said
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
round
at
Brogley
's
.
<EOS>
Within
hail
,
Heart
's
Delight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
cause
of
your
going
away
,
Walter
,
"
said
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
houseless
sister
in
your
place
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Miss
Dombey
,
"
replied
Walter
,
hesitating
---
"
if
it
is
not
too
bold
to
call
you
so
!
<EOS>
---
"
  
"
---
Walter
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
surprised
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
anything
could
make
me
happier
in
being
allowed
to
see
and
speak
to
you
,
would
it
not
be
the
discovery
that
I
had
any
means
on
earth
of
doing
you
a
moment
's
service
!
<EOS>
Where
would
I
not
go
,
what
would
I
not
do
for
your
sake
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
smiled
,
and
called
him
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
so
changed
,
"
said
Walter
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
changed
!
<EOS>
"
she
interrupted
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
me
,
"
said
Walter
,
softly
,
as
if
he
were
thinking
aloud
,
"
changed
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
left
you
such
a
child
,
and
find
you
---
oh!something
<EOS>
so
different
---
"
  
"
But
your
sister
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
forgotten
what
we
promised
to
each
other
,
when
we
parted
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Forgotten
!
"
<EOS>
But
he
said
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
you
had
---
if
suffering
and
danger
had
driven
it
from
your
thoughts
---
which
it
has
not
---
you
would
remember
it
now
,
Walter
,
when
you
find
me
poor
and
abandoned
,
with
no
home
but
this
,
and
no
friends
but
the
two
who
hear
me
speak
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
!
<EOS>
Heaven
knows
I
would
!
"
said
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Walter
,
"
exclaimed
Florence
,
through
her
sobs
and
tears
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
brother
!
<EOS>
Show
me
some
way
through
the
world
---
some
humble
path
that
I
may
take
alone
,
and
labour
in
,
and
sometimes
think
of
you
as
one
who
will
protect
and
care
for
me
as
for
a
sister
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
help
me
,
Walter
,
for
I
need
help
so
much
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dombey
!
<EOS>
Florence
!
<EOS>
I
would
die
to
help
you
.
<EOS>
But
your
friends
are
proud
and
rich
.
<EOS>
Your
father
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
<EOS>
Walter
!
"
<EOS>
She
shrieked
,
and
put
her
hands
up
to
her
head
,
in
an
attitude
of
terror
that
transfixed
him
where
he
stood
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
that
word
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
never
,
from
that
hour
,
forgot
the
voice
and
look
with
which
she
stopped
him
at
the
name
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
if
he
were
to
live
a
hundred
years
,
he
never
could
forget
it
.
  
<EOS>
Somewhere
---
anywhere
---
but
never
home
!
<EOS>
All
past
,
all
gone
,
all
lost
,
and
broken
up
!
<EOS>
The
whole
history
of
her
untold
slight
and
suffering
was
in
the
cry
and
look
;
and
he
felt
he
never
could
forget
it
,
and
he
never
did
.
  
<EOS>
She
laid
her
gentle
face
upon
the
Captain
's
shoulder
,
and
related
how
and
why
she
had
fled
.
<EOS>
If
every
sorrowing
tear
she
shed
in
doing
so
,
had
been
a
curse
upon
the
head
of
him
she
never
named
or
blamed
,
it
would
have
been
better
for
him
,
Walter
thought
,
with
awe
,
than
to
be
renounced
out
of
such
a
strength
and
might
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
precious
!
"
said
the
Captain
,
when
she
ceased
;
and
deep
attention
the
Captain
had
paid
to
her
while
she
spoke
;
listening
,
with
his
glazed
hat
all
awry
and
his
mouth
wide
open
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Awast
,
awast
,
my
eyes
!
<EOS>
Wal'r
,
dear
lad
,
sheer
off
for
to
-
night
,
and
leave
the
pretty
one
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
Walter
took
her
hand
in
both
of
his
,
and
put
it
to
his
lips
,
and
kissed
it
.
<EOS>
He
knew
now
that
she
was
,
indeed
,
a
homeless
wandering
fugitive
;
but
,
richer
to
him
so
,
than
in
all
the
wealth
and
pride
of
her
right
station
,
she
seemed
farther
off
than
even
on
the
height
that
had
made
him
giddy
in
his
boyish
dreams
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
perplexed
by
no
such
meditations
,
guarded
Florence
to
her
room
,
and
watched
at
intervals
upon
the
charmed
ground
outside
her
door
---
for
such
it
truly
was
to
him
---
until
he
felt
sufficiently
easy
in
his
mind
about
her
,
to
turn
in
under
the
counter
.
<EOS>
On
abandoning
his
watch
for
that
purpose
,
he
could
not
help
calling
once
,
rapturously
,
through
the
keyhole
,
"
Drownded
.
<EOS>
An't
<EOS>
he
,
pretty
?
"
<EOS>
---
or
,
when
he
got
down
stairs
,
making
another
trial
at
that
verse
of
Lovely
Peg
.
<EOS>
But
it
stuck
in
his
throat
somehow
,
and
he
could
make
nothing
of
it
;
so
he
went
to
bed
,
and
dreamed
that
old
Sol
Gills
was
married
to
Mrs
MacStinger
,
and

<EOS>
Mr
Toots
's
Complaint
 
<EOS>
THERE
was
an
empty
room
above
-
stairs
at
the
Wooden
Midshipman
's
,
which
,
in
days
of
yore
,
had
been
Walter
's
bedroom
.
<EOS>
Walter
,
rousing
up
the
Captain
betimes
in
the
morning
,
proposed
that
they
should
carry
thither
such
furniture
out
of
the
little
parlour
as
would
grace
it
best
,
so
that
Florence
might
take
possession
of
it
when
she
rose
.
<EOS>
As
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
to
Captain
Cuttle
than
making
himself
very
red
and
short
of
breath
in
such
a
cause
,
he
turned
to
(
as
he
himself
said
)
with
a
will
;
and
,
in
a
couple
of
hours
,
this
garret
was
transformed
into
a
species
of
land
-
cabin
,
adorned
with
all
the
choicest
moveables
out
of
the
parlour
,
inclusive
even
of
the
Tartar
frigate
,
which
the
Captain
hung
up
over
the
chimneypiece
with
such
extreme
delight
,
that
he
could
do
nothing
for
half
-
an
-
hour
afterwards
but
walk
backward
from
it
,
lost
in
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
could
be
induced
by
no
persuasion
of
Walter
's
to
wind
up
the
big
watch
,
or
to
take
back
the
canister
,
or
to
touch
the
sugar
-
tongs
and
teaspoons
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
my
lad
,
"
was
the
Captain
's
invariable
reply
to
any
solicitation
of
the
kind
,
"
I
've
made
that
there
little
property
over
,
jintly
.
<EOS>
"
These
words
he
repeated
with
great
unction
and
gravity
,
evidently
believing
that
they
had
the
virtue
of
an
Act
of
Parliament
,
and
that
unless
he
committed
himself
by
some
new
admission
of
ownership
,
no
flaw
could
be
found
in
such
a
form
of
conveyance
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
an
advantage
of
the
new
arrangement
,
that
besides
the
greater
seclusion
it
afforded
Florence
<EOS>
,
it
admitted
of
the
Midshipman
being
restored
to
his
usual
post
of
observation
,
and
also
of
the
shop
shutters
being
taken
down
.
<EOS>
The
latter
ceremony
,
however
little
importance
the
unconscious
Captain
attached
to
it
,
was
not
wholly
superfluous
;
for
,
on
the
previous
day
,
so
much
excitement
had
been
occasioned
in
the
neighbourhood
,
by
the
shutters
remaining
unopened
,
that
the
Instrument
-
maker
's
house
had
been
honoured
with
an
unusual
share
of
public
observation
,
and
had
been
intently
stared
at
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
,
by
groups
of
hungry
gazers
,
at
any
time
between
sunrise
and
sunset
.
<EOS>
The
idlers
and
vagabonds
had
been
particularly
interested
in
the
Captain
's
fate
;
constantly
grovelling
in
the
mud
to
apply
their
eyes
to
the
cellar
-
grating
,
under
the
shop
-
window
,
and
delighting
their
imaginations
with
the
fancy
that
they
could
see
a
piece
of
his
coat
as
he
hung
in
a
corner
;
though
this
settlement
of
him
was
stoutly
disputed
by
an
opposite
faction
,
who
were
of
opinion
that
he
lay
murdered
with
a
hammer
,
on
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
without
exciting
some
discontent
,
therefore
,
that
the
subject
of
these
rumours
was
seen
early
in
the
morning
standing
at
his
shop
-
door
as
hale
and
hearty
as
if
nothing
had
happened
;
and
the
beadle
of
that
quarter
,
a
man
of
an
ambitious
character
,
who
had
expected
to
have
the
distinction
of
being
present
at
the
breaking
open
of
the
door
,
and
of
giving
evidence
in
full
uniform
before
the
corner
,
went
so
far
as
to
say
to
an
opposite
neighbour
,
that
the
chap
in
the
glazed
hat
had
better
not
try
it
on
there
---
without
more
particularly
mentioning
<EOS>
what
---
and
further
,
that
he
,
the
Beadle
,
would
keep
his
eye
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
said
Walter
,
musing
,
when
they
stood
resting
from
their
labours
at
the
shop
-
door
,
looking
down
the
old
familiar
street
;
it
being
still
early
in
the
morning
;
"
nothing
at
all
of
Uncle
Sol
,
in
all
that
time
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
at
all
,
my
lad
,
"
replied
the
Captain
,
shaking
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gone
in
search
of
me
,
dear
,
kind
old
man
,
"
said
Walter
:
"
yet
never
write
to
you
!
<EOS>
But
why
not
?
<EOS>
He
says
,
in
effect
,
in
this
packet
that
you
gave
me
,
"
taking
the
paper
from
his
pocket
,
which
had
been
opened
in
the
presence
of
the
enlightened
Bunsby
,
"
that
if
you
never
hear
from
him
before
opening
it
,
you
may
believe
him
dead
.
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
!
<EOS>
But
you
would
have
heard
of
him
,
even
if
he
were
dead
!
<EOS>
Some
one
would
have
written
,
surely
,
by
his
desire
,
if
he
could
not
;
and
have
said
,
"
on
such
a
day
,
there
died
in
my
house
,
"
or
"
under
my
care
,
"
or
so
forth
,
"
Mr
Solomon
Gills
of
London
,
who
left
this
last
remembrance
and
this
last
request
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
The
Captain
,
who
had
never
climbed
to
such
a
clear
height
of
probability
before
,
was
greatly
impressed
by
the
wide
prospect
it
opened
,
and
answered
,
with
a
thoughtful
shake
of
his
head
,
"
Well
said
,
my
lad
;
wery
well
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
have
been
thinking
of
this
,
or
,
at
least
,
"
said
Walter
,
colouring
,
"
I
have
been
thinking
of
one
thing
and
another
,
all
through
a
sleepless
night
,
and
I
can
not
believe
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
but
that
my
Uncle
Sol
(
Lord
bless
him
!
)
is
alive
,
and
will
return
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
so
much
wonder
at
his
going
away
,
because
,
leaving
out
of
consideration
that
spice
of
the
marvellous
which
was
always
in
his
character
,
and
his
great
affection
for
me
,
before
which
every
other
consideration
of
his
life
became
nothing
,
as
no
one
ought
to
know
so
well
as
I
who
had
the
best
of
fathers
in
him
,
"
<EOS>
---
Walter
's
voice
was
indistinct
and
husky
here
,
and
he
looked
away
,
along
the
street
,
---
"
leaving
that
out
of
consideration
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
I
have
often
read
and
heard
of
people
who
,
having
some
near
and
dear
relative
,
who
was
supposed
to
be
shipwrecked
at
sea
,
have
gone
down
to
live
on
that
part
of
the
sea
-
shore
where
any
tidings
of
the
missing
ship
might
be
expected
to
arrive
,
though
only
an
hour
or
two
sooner
than
elsewhere
,
or
have
even
gone
upon
her
track
to
the
place
<EOS>
whither
she
was
bound
,
as
if
their
going
would
create
intelligence
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
do
such
a
thing
myself
,
as
soon
as
another
,
or
sooner
than
many
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
But
why
my
uncle
should
n't
write
to
you
,
when
he
so
clearly
intended
to
do
so
,
or
how
he
should
die
abroad
,
and
you
not
know
it
through
some
other
hand
,
I
can
not
make
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
observed
,
with
a
shake
of
his
head
,
that
Jack
Bunsby
himself
had
n't
made
it
out
,
and
that
he
was
a
man
as
could
give
a
pretty
taut
opinion
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
my
uncle
had
been
a
heedless
young
man
,
likely
to
be
entrapped
by
jovial
company
to
some
drinking
-
place
,
where
he
was
to
be
got
rid
of
for
the
sake
of
what
money
he
might
have
about
him
,
"
said
Walter
;
"
or
if
he
had
been
a
reckless
sailor
,
going
ashore
with
two
or
three
months
'
pay
in
his
pocket
,
I
could
understand
his
disappearing
,
and
leaving
no
trace
behind
.
<EOS>
But
,
being
what
he
was
---
and
is
,
I
hope
---
I
ca
n't
believe
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wal'r
,
my
lad
,
"
inquired
the
Captain
wistfully
eyeing
him
as
he
pondered
and
pondered
,
"
What
do
you
make
of
it
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
returned
Walter
,
"
I
do
n't
know
what
to
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
never
has
written
!
<EOS>
There
is
no
doubt
about
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
so
be
as
Sol
Gills
wrote
,
my
lad
,
"
replied
the
Captain
,
argumentatively
,
"
<EOS>
where
's
his
dispatch
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
that
he
intrusted
it
to
some
private
hand
,
"
suggested
Walter
,
"
and
that
it
has
been
forgotten
,
or
carelessly
thrown
aside
,
or
lost
.
<EOS>
Even
that
is
more
probable
to
me
,
than
the
other
event
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
not
only
can
not
bear
to
contemplate
that
other
event
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
but
I
ca
n't
,
and
wo
n't
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hope
,
you
see
,
Wal'r
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
sagely
,
"
Hope
.
<EOS>
It
's
that
as
animates
you
.
<EOS>
Hope
is
a
buoy
,
for
which
you
overhaul
your
Little
Warbler
,
sentimental
diwision
,
but
Lord
,
my
lad
,
like
any
other
buoy
,
it
only
floats
;
it
ca
n't
be
steered
nowhere
.
<EOS>
Along
with
the
figure
-
head
of
Hope
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
there
's
a
anchor
;
but
what
's
the
good
of
my
having
a
anchor
,
if
I
ca
n't
find
no
bottom
to
let
it
go
in
?
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
said
this
rather
in
his
character
of
a
sagacious
citizen
and
householder
,
bound
to
impart
a
morsel
from
his
stores
of
wisdom
,
to
an
inexperienced
youth
,
than
in
his
own
proper
person
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
his
face
was
quite
luminous
as
he
spoke
,
with
new
hope
,
caught
from
Walter
;
and
he
appropriately
concluded
by
slapping
him
on
the
back
;
and
saying
,
with
enthusiasm
,
"
Hooroar
,
my
lad
!
<EOS>
Indiwidually
,
I
'm
o
'
your
opinion
.
"
  
<EOS>
Walter
,
with
his
cheerful
laugh
,
returned
the
salutation
,
and
said
:
  
"
Only
one
word
more
about
my
uncle
at
present
,
Captain
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
is
impossible
that
he
can
have
written
in
the
ordinary
course
---
by
mail
packet
,
or
ship
letter
,
you
understand
---
"
  
"
Aye
,
aye
,
my
lad
,
"
said
the
Captain
approvingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
And
that
you
have
missed
the
letter
any
how
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Wal'r
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
turning
his
eyes
upon
him
with
a
faint
approach
to
a
severe
expression
,
"
an't
<EOS>
I
been
on
the
look
out
for
any
tidings
of
that
man
o
'
science
,
old
Sol
Gills
,
your
uncle
,
day
and
night
,
ever
since
I
lost
him
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An't
<EOS>
my
heart
been
heavy
and
watchful
always
,
along
of
him
and
you
?
<EOS>
Sleeping
and
waking
,
an't
<EOS>
I
been
upon
my
post
,
and
would
n't
I
scorn
to
quit
it
while
this
here
Midshipman
held
together
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
replied
Walter
,
grasping
his
hand
,
"
I
know
you
would
,
and
I
know
how
faithful
and
earnest
all
you
say
and
feel
is
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
doubt
that
I
am
as
sure
of
it
as
I
am
that
my
foot
is
again
upon
this
door
-
step
or
that
I
again
have
hold
of
this
true
hand
.
<EOS>
Do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
Wal'r
,
"
returned
the
Captain
,
with
his
beaming
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
hazard
no
more
conjectures
,
"
said
Walter
,
fervently
shaking
the
hard
hand
of
the
Captain
,
who
shook
his
with
no
less
good
-
will
.
<EOS>
"
All
I
will
add
is
,
Heaven
forbid
that
I
should
touch
my
uncle
's
possessions
,
Captain
Cuttle
!
<EOS>
Everything
that
he
left
here
,
shall
remain
in
the
care
of
the
truest
of
stewards
and
kindest
of
men
---
and
if
his
name
is
not
Cuttle
,
he
has
no
name
!
<EOS>
Now
,
best
of
friends
,
about
---
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
change
in
Walter
's
manner
,
as
he
came
to
these
two
words
;
and
when
he
uttered
them
,
all
his
confidence
and
cheerfulness
appeared
to
have
deserted
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
before
Miss
Dombey
stopped
me
when
I
spoke
of
her
father
last
night
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
---
<EOS>
you
remember
how
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
well
remembered
,
and
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
before
that
,
that
we
had
but
one
hard
duty
to
perform
,
and
that
it
was
,
to
prevail
upon
her
to
communicate
with
her
friends
,
and
to
return
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
muttered
a
feeble
"
Awast
!
"
or
a
"
Stand
by
!
"
or
something
or
other
,
equally
pertinent
to
the
occasion
;
but
it
was
rendered
so
extremely
feeble
by
the
total
discomfiture
with
which
he
received
this
announcement
,
that
what
it
was
,
is
mere
matter
of
conjecture
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
that
is
over
.
<EOS>
I
think
so
no
longer
.
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
be
put
back
again
upon
that
piece
of
wreck
,
on
which
I
have
so
often
floated
,
since
my
preservation
,
in
my
dreams
,
and
there
left
to
drift
,
and
drive
,
and
die
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hooroar
,
my
lad
!
"
exclaimed
the
Captain
,
in
a
burst
of
uncontrollable
satisfaction
.
"
<EOS>
Hooroar
!
<EOS>
hooroar
!
<EOS>
hooroar
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
think
that
she
,
so
young
,
so
good
,
and
beautiful
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
so
delicately
brought
up
,
and
born
to
such
a
different
fortune
,
should
strive
with
the
rough
world
!
<EOS>
But
we
have
seen
the
gulf
that
cuts
off
all
behind
her
,
though
no
one
but
herself
can
know
how
deep
it
is
;
and
there
is
no
return
.
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
without
quite
understanding
this
,
greatly
approved
of
it
,
and
observed
in
a
tone
of
strong
corroboration
,
that
the
wind
was
quite
abaft
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
ought
not
to
be
alone
here
;
ought
she
,
Captain
Cuttle
?
"
said
Walter
,
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
lad
,
"
replied
the
Captain
,
after
a
little
sagacious
consideration
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
You
being
here
to
keep
her
company
,
you
see
,
and
you
two
being
jintly
"
  
"
Dear
Captain
Cuttle
!
"
remonstrated
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
I
being
here
!
<EOS>
Miss
Dombey
,
in
her
guileless
innocent
heart
,
regards
me
as
her
adopted
brother
;
but
what
would
the
guile
and
guilt
of
my
heart
be
,
if
I
pretended
to
believe
that
I
had
any
right
to
approach
her
,
familiarly
,
in
that
character
---
if
I
pretended
to
forget
that
I
am
bound
,
in
honour
,
not
to
do
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wal'r
,
my
lad
,
"
hinted
the
Captain
,
with
some
revival
of
his
discomfiture
,
"
<EOS>
an't
there
<EOS>
no
other
character
as
"
  
"
Oh
!
"
returned
Walter
,
"
would
you
have
me
die
in
her
esteem
---
in
such
esteem
as
hers
---
and
put
a
veil
between
myself
and
her
angel
's
face
for
ever
,
by
taking
advantage
of
her
being
here
for
refuge
,
<EOS>
so
trusting
and
so
unprotected
,
to
endeavour
to
exalt
myself
into
her
lover
?
<EOS>
What
do
I
say
?
<EOS>
There
is
no
one
in
the
world
who
would
be
more
opposed
to
me
if
I
could
do
so
,
than
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wal'r
,
my
lad
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
drooping
more
and
more
,
"
prowiding
as
there
is
any
just
cause
or
impediment
why
two
persons
should
not
be
jined
together
in
the
house
of
bondage
,
for
which
you
'll
overhaul
the
place
and
make
a
note
<EOS>
,
I
hope
I
should
declare
it
as
promised
and
wowed
in
the
banns
.
<EOS>
So
there
an't
no
other
character
;
an't
there
,
my
lad
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Walter
briskly
waved
his
hand
in
the
negative
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
lad
,
"
growled
the
Captain
slowly
,
"
I
wo
n't
deny
but
<EOS>
what
I
find
myself
wery
much
down
by
the
head
,
along
o
'
this
here
,
or
<EOS>
but
what
I
've
gone
clean
about
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
Lady
-
lass
,
Wal'r
,
mind
you
,
wot
's
respect
and
duty
to
her
is
respect
and
duty
in
my
articles
,
howsumiver
disapinting
;
and
therefore
I
follows
in
your
wake
,
my
lad
,
and
feel
as
you
are
,
no
doubt
,
acting
up
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
And
there
an't
no
other
character
,
an't
there
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
Captain
,
musing
over
the
ruins
of
his
fallen
castle
with
a
very
despondent
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
said
Walter
,
starting
a
fresh
point
with
a
gayer
air
,
to
cheer
the
Captain
up
---
but
nothing
could
do
that
;
he
was
too
much
concerned
---
"
I
think
we
should
exert
ourselves
to
find
some
one
who
would
be
a
proper
attendant
for
Miss
Dombey
while
she
remains
here
,
and
who
may
be
trusted
.
<EOS>
None
of
her
relations
may
.
<EOS>
It
's
clear
<EOS>
Miss
Dombey
feels
that
they
are
all
subservient
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
What
has
become
of
Susan
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
young
woman
?
"
returned
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
belief
as
she
was
sent
away
again
the
will
of
Heart
's
Delight
.
<EOS>
I
made
a
signal
for
her
when
Lady
-
lass
first
come
,
and
she
rated
of
her
wery
high
,
and
said
she
had
been
gone
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
do
you
ask
Miss
Dombey
where
she
's
gone
,
and
we
'll
try
to
find
her
.
<EOS>
The
morning
's
getting
on
,
and
Miss
Dombey
will
soon
be
rising
.
<EOS>
You
are
her
best
friend
.
<EOS>
Wait
for
her
up
stairs
,
and
leave
me
to
take
care
of
all
down
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
very
crest
-
fallen
indeed
,
echoed
the
sigh
with
which
Walter
said
this
,
and
complied
.
<EOS>
Florence
was
delighted
with
her
new
room
,
anxious
to
see
Walter
,
and
overjoyed
at
the
prospect
of
greeting
her
old
friend
Susan
.
<EOS>
But
Florence
could
not
say
where
Susan
was
gone
,
except
that
it
was
in
Essex
,
and
no
one
could
say
,
she
remembered
,
unless
it
were
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
With
this
information
the
melancholy
Captain
returned
to
Walter
,
and
gave
him
to
understand
that
Mr
Toots
was
the
young
gentleman
whom
he
had
encountered
on
the
door
-
step
,
and
that
he
was
a
friend
of
his
,
and
that
he
was
a
young
gentleman
of
property
,
and
that
he
hopelessly
adored
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
also
related
how
the
intelligence
of
Walter
's
supposed
fate
had
first
made
him
acquainted
with
Mr
Toots
,
and
how
there
was
solemn
treaty
and
compact
between
them
,
that
Mr
Toots
should
be
mute
upon
the
subject
of
his
love
.
  
<EOS>
The
question
then
was
,
whether
Florence
could
trust
Mr
Toots
;
and
Florence
saying
,
with
a
smile
,
"
Oh
,
yes
,
with
her
whole
heart
!
"
<EOS>
it
became
important
to
find
out
where
Mr
Toots
lived
.
<EOS>
This
Florence
did
n't
know
,
and
the
Captain
had
forgotten
;
and
the
Captain
was
telling
Walter
,
in
the
little
parlour
,
that
Mr
Toots
was
sure
to
be
there
soon
,
when
in
came
Mr
Toots
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Gills
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
rushing
into
the
parlour
without
any
ceremony
,
"
I
'm
in
a
state
of
mind
bordering
on
distraction
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
had
discharged
those
words
,
as
from
a
mortar
,
before
he
observed
Walter
,
whom
he
recognised
with
what
may
be
described
as
a
chuckle
of
misery
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
excuse
me
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
holding
his
forehead
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
'm
at
present
in
that
state
that
my
brain
is
going
,
if
not
gone
,
and
anything
approaching
to
politeness
in
an
individual
so
situated
would
be
a
hollow
mockery
.
<EOS>
Captain
Gills
,
I
beg
to
request
the
favour
of
a
private
interview
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Brother
,
"
returned
the
Captain
,
taking
him
by
the
hand
,
"
you
are
the
man
as
we
was
on
the
look
-
out
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
what
a
look
-
out
that
must
be
,
of
which
I
am
the
object
!
<EOS>
I
have
n't
dared
to
shave
<EOS>
,
I
'm
in
that
rash
state
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
had
my
clothes
brushed
.
<EOS>
My
hair
is
mattered
together
.
<EOS>
I
told
the
Chicken
that
if
he
offered
to
clean
my
boots
,
I
'd
stretch
him
a
corpse
before
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
All
these
indications
of
a
disordered
mind
were
verified
in
Mr
Toots
's
appearance
,
which
was
wild
and
savage
.
  
<EOS>
"
See
here
,
Brother
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
This
here
's
old
Sol
Gills
's
nevy
Wal'r
.
<EOS>
Him
as
was
supposed
to
have
perished
at
sea
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
took
his
hand
from
his
forehead
,
and
stared
at
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
me
!
"
stammered
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
complication
of
misery
!
<EOS>
How
-
de
-
do
?
<EOS>
I
---
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
'm
afraid
you
must
have
got
very
wet
.
<EOS>
Captain
Gills
,
will
you
allow
me
a
word
in
the
shop
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
took
the
Captain
by
the
coat
,
and
going
out
with
him
whispered
:
  
"
That
then
,
Captain
Gills
,
is
the
party
you
spoke
of
,
when
you
said
that
he
and
Miss
Dombey
were
made
for
one
another
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
aye
,
my
lad
,
"
replied
the
disconsolate
Captain
;
"
I
was
of
that
mind
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
at
this
time
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Toots
,
with
his
hand
to
his
forehead
again
.
<EOS>
"
Of
all
others
!
<EOS>
---
a
hated
rival
!
<EOS>
At
least
,
he
an't
a
hated
rival
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
stopping
short
,
on
second
thoughts
,
and
taking
away
his
hand
;
"
what
should
I
hate
him
for
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
If
my
affection
has
been
truly
disinterested
,
Captain
Gills
,
let
me
prove
it
now
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
shot
back
abruptly
into
the
parlour
,
and
said
,
wringing
Walter
by
the
hand
:
  
"
How
-
de
-
do
?
<EOS>
I
hope
you
did
n't
take
any
cold
.
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
shall
be
very
glad
if
you
'll
give
me
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
and
honour
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
warming
as
he
became
better
acquainted
with
Walter
's
face
and
figure
,
"
I
'm
very
glad
to
see
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
heartily
,
"
said
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
desire
a
more
genuine
and
genial
welcome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Could
n't
you
,
though
?
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
still
shaking
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
kind
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
'm
much
obliged
to
you
.
<EOS>
How
-
de

do
?
<EOS>
I
hope
you
left
everybody
quite
well
over
the

that

upon
the

I
mean
wherever
you
came
from
last
,
you
know

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
All
these
good
wishes
,
and
better
intentions
,
Walter
responded
to
manfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Gills
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
I
should
wish
to
be
strictly
honourable
;
but
I
trust
I
may
be
allowed
now
,
to
allude
to
a
certain
subject
that
"
  
"
Aye
,
aye
,
my
lad
,
"
returned
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Freely
,
freely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
and
Lieutenant
Walters
,
are
you
aware
that
the
most
dreadful
circumstances
have
been
happening
at
Mr
Dombey
's
house
,
and
that
Miss
Dombey
herself
has
left
her
father
,
who
,
in
my
opinion
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
with
great
excitement
,
"
it
<EOS>
a
Brute
,
that
it
would
be
a
flattery
to
call
a

a
marble
monument
,
or
a
bird
of
prey
,
---
and
that
she
is
not
to
be
found
,
and
has
gone
no
one
knows
where
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
how
you
heard
this
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lieutenant
Walters
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
who
had
arrived
at
that
appellation
by
a
process
peculiar
to
himself
;
probably
by
jumbling
up
his
Christian
name
with
the
seafaring
profession
,
and
supposing
some
relationship
between
him
and
the
Captain
,
which
would
extend
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
to
their
titles
;
"
Lieutenant
Walters
,
I
can
have
on
objection
to
make
a
straightforward
reply
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
that
feeling
extremely
interested
in
everything
that
relates
to
Miss
Dombey
---
not
for
any
selfish
reason
,
Lieutenant
Walters
,
for
I
am
well
aware
that
the
most
agreeable
thing
I
could
do
for
all
parties
would
be
to
put
an
end
to
my
existence
,
which
can
only
be
regarded
as
an
inconvenience
<EOS>
---
I
have
been
in
the
habit
of
bestowing
a
trifle
now
and
then
upon
a
footman
;
a
most
respectable
young
man
,
of
the
name
of
Towlinson
,
who
has
lived
in
the
family
some
time
;
and
Towlinson
informed
me
,
yesterday
evening
,
that
this
was
the
state
of
things
.
<EOS>
Since
which
,
Captain
Gills
---
and
Lieutenant
Walters
---
I
have
been
perfectly
frantic
,
and
have
been
lying
down
on
the
sofa
all
night
,
the
Ruin
you
behold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Toots
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
I
am
happy
to
be
able
to
relieve
your
mind

<EOS>
Pray
calm
yourself
.
<EOS>
Miss
Dombey
is
safe
and
well

<EOS>
"
  
"
Sir
!
"
cried
Mr
Toots
,
starting
from
his
chair
and
shaking
hands
with
him
anew
,
"
the
relief
is
so
excessive
,
and
unspeakable
,
that
if
you
were
to
tell
me
now
that
Miss
Dombey
was
married
even
,
I
could
smile
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
appealing
to
him
,
"
upon
my
soul
and
body
<EOS>
,
I
really
think
,
whatever
I
might
do
to
myself
immediately
afterwards
,
that
I
could
smile
,
I
am
so
relieved
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
a
greater
relief
and
delight
still
,
to
such
a
generous
mind
as
yours
,
"
said
Walter
,
not
at
all
slow
in
returning
his
greeting
,
"
to
find
that
you
can
render
service
to
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
take
Mr
Toots
up
stairs
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
beckoned
to
Mr
Toots
,
who
followed
him
with
a
bewildered
countenance
,
and
,
ascending
to
the
top
of
the
house
,
was
introduced
,
without
a
word
of
preparation
from
his
conductor
,
into
Florence
's
new
retreat
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr
Toots
's
amazement
and
pleasure
at
sight
of
her
were
such
,
that
they
could
find
a
vent
in
nothing
but
extravagance
.
<EOS>
He
ran
up
to
her
,
seized
her
hand
,
kissed
it
,
dropped
it
,
seized
it
again
,
fell
upon
one
knee
,
shed
tears
,
chuckled
,
and
was
quite
regardless
of
his
danger
of
being
pinned
by
Diogenes
,
who
,
inspired
by
the
belief
that
there
was
something
hostile
to
his
mistress
in
these
demonstrations
,
worked
round
and
round
him
,
as
if
only
undecided
at
what
particular
point
to
go
in
for
the
assault
,
but
quite
resolved
to
do
him
a
fearful
mischief
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
Di

bad

forgetful
dog

Thankee
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
I
am
pretty
well
,
I
'm
much
obliged
to
you
,
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
I
hope
all
the
family
are
the
same
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
said
this
without
the
least
notion
of
what
he
was
talking
about
,
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
,
staring
at
Florence
with
the
liveliest
contention
of
delight
and
despair
going
on
in
his
face
that
any
face
could
exhibit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Gills
and
Lieutenant
Walters
have
mentioned
,
Miss
Dombey
,
"
gasped
Mr
Toots
,
"
that
I
can
do
you
some
service
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
by
any
means
wash
out
the
remembrance
of
that
day
at
Brighton
,
when
I
conducted
myself
---
much
more
like
a
Parricide
than
a
person
of
independent
property
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
with
severe
self
-
accusation
,
"
I
should
sink
into
the
silent
tomb
with
a
gleam
of
joy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Mr
Toots
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
do
not
wish
me
to
forget
anything
in
our
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
I
never
can
,
believe
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
far
too
kind
and
good
to
me
always
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Miss
Dombey
,
"
returned
Mr
Toots
,
"
your
consideration
for
my
feelings
is
a
part
of
your
angelic
character
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
a
thousand
times
.
<EOS>
It
's
of
no
consequence
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
we
thought
of
asking
you
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
is
,
whether
you
remember
where
Susan
,
whom
you
were
so
kind
as
to
accompany
to
the
coach
-
office
when
she
left
me
,
is
to
be
found
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
I
do
not
certainly
,
Miss
Dombey
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
after
a
little
consideration
,
"
remember
the
exact
name
of
the
place
that
was
on
the
coach
;
and
I
do
recollect
that
she
said
she
was
not
going
to
stop
there
,
but
was
going
farther
on
.
<EOS>
But
,
Miss
Dombey
,
if
your
object
is
to
find
her
,
and
to
have
her
here
,
myself
and
the
Chicken
will
produce
her
with
every
dispatch
that
devotion
on
my
part
,
and
great
intelligence
on
the
Chicken
's
,
can
insure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
was
so
manifestly
delighted
and
revived
by
the
prospect
of
being
useful
,
and
the
disinterested
sincerity
of
his
devotion
was
so
unquestionable
,
that
it
would
have
been
cruel
to
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
Florence
,
with
an
instinctive
delicacy
,
forbore
to
urge
the
least
obstacle
,
though
she
did
not
forbear
to
over
-
power
him
with
thanks
;
and
Mr
Toots
proudly
took
the
commission
upon
himself
for
immediate
execution
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dombey
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
touching
her
proffered
hand
,
with
a
pang
of
hopeless
love
visibly
shooting
through
him
,
and
flashing
out
in
his
face
,
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
!
<EOS>
Allow
me
to
take
the
liberty
of
saying
,
that
your
misfortunes
make
me
perfectly
wretched
,
and
that
you
may
trust
me
,
next
to
Captain
Gills
himself
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
aware
,
Miss
Dombey
,
of
my
own
deficiencies
---
they
're
not
of
the
least
consequence
,
thank
you
---
<EOS>
but
I
am
entirely
to
be
relied
upon
,
I
do
assure
you
,
Miss
Dombey
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
Mr
Toots
came
out
of
the
room
,
again
accompanied
by
the
Captain
,
who
,
standing
at
a
little
distance
,
holding
his
hat
under
his
arm
and
arranging
his
scattered
locks
with
his
hook
,
had
been
a
not
uninterested
witness
of
what
passed
.
<EOS>
And
when
the
door
closed
behind
them
,
the
light
of
Mr
Toots
's
life
was
darkly
clouded
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Gills
,
"
said
that
gentleman
,
stopping
near
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
,
and
turning
round
,
"
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
am
not
in
a
frame
of
mind
at
the
present
moment
,
in
which
I
could
see
Lieutenant
Walters
with
that
entirely
friendly
feeling
towards
him
that
I
should
wish
to
harbour
in
my
breast
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
always
command
our
feelings
,
Captain
Gills
,
and
I
should
take
it
as
a
particular
favour
if
you
'd
let
me
out
at
the
private
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Brother
,
"
returned
the
Captain
,
"
you
shall
shape
your
own
course
.
<EOS>
Wotever
course
you
take
,
is
plain
and
seamanlike
,
I
'm
wery
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Captain
Gills
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
you
're
extremely
kind
.
<EOS>
Your
good
opinion
is
a
consolation
to
me
.
<EOS>
There
is
one
thing
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
standing
in
the
passage
,
behind
the
half
-
opened
door
,
"
that
I
hope
you
'll
bear
in
mind
,
Captain
Gills
,
and
that
I
should
wish
Lieutenant
Walters
to
be
made
acquainted
with
.
<EOS>
I
have
quite
come
into
my
property
now
,
you
know
,
and
---
<EOS>
and
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
be
at
all
useful
in
a
pecuniary
point
of
view
,
I
should
glide
into
the
silent
tomb
with
ease
and
smoothness
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
said
no
more
,
but
slipped
out
quietly
and
shut
the
door
upon
himself
,
to
cut
the
Captain
off
from
any
reply
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
thought
of
this
good
creature
,
long
after
he
had
left
her
,
with
mingled
emotions
of
pain
and
pleasure
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
honest
and
warm
-
hearted
,
that
to
see
him
again
and
be
assured
of
his
truth
to
her
in
her
distress
,
was
a
joy
and
comfort
beyond
all
price
;
but
for
that
very
reason
,
it
was
so
affecting
to
think
that
she
caused
him
a
moment
's
unhappiness
,
or
ruffled
,
by
a
breath
,
the
harmless
current
of
his
life
,
that
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
,
and
her
bosom
overflowed
with
pity
.
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
in
his
different
way
,
thought
much
of
Mr
Toots
too
;
and
so
did
Walter
;
and
when
the
evening
came
,
and
they
were
all
sitting
together
in
Florence
's
new
room
,
Walter
praised
him
in
a
most
impassioned
manner
,
and
told
Florence
what
he
had
said
on
leaving
the
house
,
with
every
graceful
setting
-
off
in
the
way
of
comment
and
appreciation
that
his
own
honesty
and
sympathy
could
surround
it
with
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
did
not
return
upon
the
next
day
,
or
the
next
,
or
for
several
days
;
and
in
the
meanwhile
Florence
,
without
any
new
alarm
,
live
like
a
quiet
bird
in
a
cage
,
at
the
top
of
the
old
Instrument
-
maker
's
house
.
<EOS>
But
Florence
drooped
and
hung
her
head
more
and
more
plainly
,
as
the
days
went
on
;
and
the
expression
that
had
been
seen
in
the
face
of
the
dead
child
,
was
often
turned
to
the
sky
from
her
high
window
,
as
if
it
sought
his
angel
out
,
on
the
bright
shore
of
which
he
had
spoken
:
lying
on
his
little
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
had
been
weak
and
delicate
of
late
,
and
the
agitation
she
had
undergone
was
not
without
its
influences
on
her
health
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
no
bodily
illness
that
affected
her
now
.
<EOS>
She
was
distressed
in
mind
;
and
the
cause
of
her
distress
was
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
Interested
in
her
,
anxious
for
her
,
proud
and
glad
to
serve
her
,
and
showing
all
this
with
the
enthusiasm
and
ardour
of
his
character
<EOS>
,
Florence
saw
that
he
avoided
her
.
<EOS>
All
the
long
day
through
,
he
seldom
approached
her
room
.
<EOS>
If
she
asked
for
him
,
he
came
,
again
for
the
moment
as
earnest
and
as
bright
as
she
remembered
him
when
she
was
a
lost
child
in
the
staring
streets
;
but
he
soon
became
constrained
---
her
quick
affection
was
too
watchful
not
to
know
it
---
and
uneasy
,
and
soon
left
her
.
<EOS>
Unsought
,
he
never
came
,
all
day
,
between
the
morning
and
the
night
.
<EOS>
When
the
evening
closed
in
,
he
was
always
there
,
and
that
was
her
happiest
time
,
<EOS>
for
then
she
half
believed
that
the
old
Walter
of
her
childhood
was
not
changed
.
<EOS>
But
,
even
then
,
some
trivial
word
,
look
,
or
circumstance
would
show
her
that
there
was
an
indefinable
division
between
them
which
could
not
be
passed
.
  
<EOS>
And
she
could
not
but
see
that
these
revealings
of
a
great
alteration
in
Walter
manifested
themselves
in
despite
of
his
utmost
efforts
to
hide
them
.
<EOS>
In
his
consideration
for
her
,
she
thought
,
and
in
the
earnestness
of
his
desire
to
spare
her
any
wound
from
his
kind
hand
,
he
resorted
to
innumerable
little
artifices
and
disguises
.
<EOS>
So
much
the
more
did
Florence
feel
the
greatness
of
the
alteration
in
him
;
so
much
the
oftener
<EOS>
did
she
weep
at
this
estrangement
of
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
The
good
Captain
---
<EOS>
her
untiring
,
tender
,
ever
zealous
friend
---
saw
it
,
too
,
Florence
thought
,
and
it
pained
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
less
cheerful
and
hopeful
than
he
had
been
at
first
,
and
would
steal
looks
at
her
and
Walter
,
by
turns
,
when
they
were
all
three
together
of
an
evening
,
with
quite
a
sad
face
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
resolved
,
at
last
,
to
speak
to
Walter
.
<EOS>
She
believed
she
knew
now
what
the
cause
of
his
estrangement
was
,
and
she
thought
it
would
be
a
relief
to
her
full
heart
,
and
would
set
him
more
at
ease
,
if
she
told
him
she
had
found
it
out
,
and
quite
submitted
to
it
,
and
did
not
reproach
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
on
a
certain
Sunday
afternoon
,
that
Florence
took
this
resolution
.
<EOS>
The
faithful
Captain
,
in
an
amazing
shirt
-
collar
,
was
sitting
by
her
,
reading
with
his
spectacles
on
,
and
she
asked
him
where
Walter
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
's
down
below
,
my
lady
lass
,
"
returned
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
speak
to
him
,
"
said
Florence
,
rising
hurriedly
as
if
to
go
down
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
rouse
him
up
here
,
Beauty
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
in
a
trice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Thereupon
the
Captain
,
with
much
alacrity
,
shouldered
his
book
---
<EOS>
for
he
made
it
a
point
of
duty
to
read
none
but
very
large
books
on
a
Sunday
,
as
having
a
more
staid
appearance
:
and
had
bargained
,
years
ago
,
for
a
prodigious
volume
at
a
book
-
stall
,
five
lines
of
which
utterly
confounded
him
at
any
time
,
insomuch
that
he
had
not
yet
ascertained
of
what
subject
it
treated
---
and
withdrew
.
<EOS>
Walter
soon
appeared
.
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Cuttle
tells
me
,
Miss
Dombey
,
"
he
eagerly
began
on
coming
in
---
but
stopped
when
he
saw
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
so
well
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
You
look
distressed
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
weeping
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
spoke
so
kindly
,
and
with
such
a
fervent
tremor
in
his
voice
,
that
the
tears
gushed
into
her
eyes
at
the
sound
of
his
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Walter
,
"
said
Florence
,
gently
,
"
I
am
not
quite
well
,
and
I
have
been
weeping
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
sat
down
opposite
to
her
,
looking
at
her
beautiful
and
innocent
face
:
and
his
own
turned
pale
,
and
his
lips
trembled
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
said
,
upon
the
night
when
I
knew
that
you
were
saved
---
<EOS>
and
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
dear
Walter
,
what
I
felt
that
night
,
and
what
I
hoped
!
"
<EOS>
---
   
<EOS>
He
put
his
trembling
hand
upon
the
table
between
them
,
and
sat
looking
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
---
"
that
I
was
changed
.
<EOS>
I
was
surprised
to
hear
you
say
so
,
but
I
understand
,
now
,
that
I
am
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
angry
with
me
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
I
was
too
much
overjoyed
to
think
of
it
,
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
seemed
a
child
to
him
again
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
ingenuous
,
confiding
,
loving
child
he
saw
and
heard
.
<EOS>
Not
the
dear
woman
,
at
whose
feet
he
would
have
laid
the
riches
of
the
earth
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
the
last
time
I
saw
you
,
Walter
,
before
you
went
away
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
into
his
breast
,
and
took
out
a
little
purse
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
worn
it
round
my
neck
!
<EOS>
If
I
had
gone
down
in
the
deep
,
it
would
have
been
with
me
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
wear
it
still
,
Walter
,
for
my
old
sake
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Until
I
die
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
laid
her
hand
on
his
,
as
fearlessly
and
simply
,
as
if
not
a
day
had
intervened
since
she
gave
him
the
little
token
of
remembrance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
always
glad
to
think
so
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
Do
you
recollect
that
a
thought
of
this
change
seemed
to
come
into
our
minds
at
the
same
time
that
evening
,
when
we
were
talking
together
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
<EOS>
he
answered
,
in
a
wondering
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
the
means
of
injuring
your
hopes
and
prospects
even
then
.
<EOS>
I
feared
to
think
so
,
then
,
but
I
know
it
now
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
able
,
then
,
in
your
generosity
,
to
hide
from
me
that
you
knew
it
too
,
you
can
not
do
so
now
,
although
you
try
as
generously
as
before
.
<EOS>
You
do
.
<EOS>
I
thank
you
for
it
,
Walter
,
deeply
,
truly
;
but
you
can
not
succeed
.
<EOS>
You
have
suffered
too
much
in
your
own
hardships
,
and
in
those
of
your
dearest
relation
,
quite
to
overlook
the
innocent
cause
of
all
the
peril
and
affliction
that
has
befallen
you
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
quite
forget
me
in
that
character
,
and
we
can
be
brother
and
sister
no
longer
.
<EOS>
But
,
dear
Walter
,
do
not
think
that
I
complain
of
you
in
this
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
known
it
---
ought
to
have
known
it
---
but
forgot
it
in
my
joy
.
<EOS>
All
I
hope
is
that
you
may
think
of
me
less
irksomely
when
this
feeling
is
no
more
a
secret
one
;
and
all
I
ask
is
,
Walter
,
in
the
name
of
the
poor
child
who
was
your
sister
once
,
that
you
will
not
struggle
with
yourself
,
and
pain
yourself
,
for
my
sake
,
now
that
I
know
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
Walter
had
looked
upon
her
while
she
said
this
,
with
a
face
so
full
of
wonder
and
amazement
,
that
it
had
room
for
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
Now
he
caught
up
the
hand
that
touched
his
,
so
entreatingly
,
and
held
it
between
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Miss
Dombey
,
"
he
said
,
"
is
it
possible
that
while
I
have
been
suffering
so
much
,
in
striving
with
my
sense
of
what
is
due
to
you
,
and
must
be
rendered
to
you
,
I
have
made
you
suffer
what
your
words
disclose
to
me
?
<EOS>
Never
,
never
,
before
Heaven
,
have
I
thought
of
you
but
as
the
single
,
bright
,
pure
,
blessed
recollection
of
my
boyhood
and
my
youth
.
<EOS>
Never
have
I
from
the
first
,
and
never
shall
I
to
the
last
,
regard
your
part
in
my
life
,
but
as
something
sacred
,
never
to
be
lightly
thought
of
,
never
to
be
esteemed
enough
,
never
,
until
death
,
to
be
forgotten
.
<EOS>
Again
to
see
you
look
,
and
hear
you
speak
,
as
you
did
on
that
night
when
we
parted
,
is
happiness
to
me
that
there
are
no
words
to
utter
;
and
to
be
loved
and
trusted
as
your
brother
,
is
the
next
great
gift
I
could
receive
and
prize
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Walter
,
"
said
Florence
,
looking
at
him
earnestly
,
but
with
a
changing
face
<EOS>
,
"
what
is
that
which
is
due
to
me
,
and
must
be
rendered
to
me
,
at
the
sacrifice
of
all
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Respect
,
"
said
Walter
,
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"
Reverence
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
colour
dawned
in
her
face
,
and
she
timidly
and
thoughtfully
withdrew
her
hand
;
still
looking
at
him
with
unabated
earnestness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
a
brother
's
right
,
"
said
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
a
brother
's
claim
.
<EOS>
I
left
a
child
.
<EOS>
I
find
a
woman
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
colour
overspread
her
face
.
<EOS>
She
made
a
gesture
as
if
of
entreaty
that
he
would
say
no
more
,
and
her
face
dropped
upon
her
hands
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
both
silent
for
a
time
;
she
weeping
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
owe
it
to
a
heart
so
trusting
,
pure
,
and
good
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
even
to
tear
myself
from
it
,
though
I
rend
my
own
.
<EOS>
How
dare
I
say
it
is
my
sister
's
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
weeping
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
been
happy
;
surrounded
as
you
should
be
by
loving
and
admiring
friends
,
and
by
all
that
makes
the
station
you
were
born
to
enviable
,
"
said
Walter
;
"
and
if
you
had
called
me
brother
,
then
,
in
your
affectionate
remembrance
of
the
past
,
I
could
have
answered
to
the
name
from
my
distant
place
,
with
no
inward
assurance
that
I
wronged
your
spotless
truth
by
doing
so
.
<EOS>
But
here

and
now
!
"
---
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
thank
you
,
thank
you
,
Walter

<EOS>
Forgive
my
having
wronged
you
so
much
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
one
to
advise
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Florence
!
"
said
Walter
,
passionately
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
hurried
on
to
say
,
what
I
thought
,
but
a
few
moments
ago
,
nothing
could
have
forced
from
my
lips
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
prosperous
;
if
I
had
any
means
or
hope
of
being
one
day
able
to
restore
you
to
a
station
near
your
own
;
I
would
have
told
you
that
there
was
one
name
you
might
bestow
upon
me
---
a
right
above
all
others
,
to
protect
and
cherish
you
---
that
I
was
worthy
of
in
nothing
but
the
love
and
honour
that
I
bore
you
,
and
in
my
whole
heart
being
yours
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
told
you
that
it
was
the
only
claim
that
you
could
give
me
to
defend
and
guard
you
,
which
I
dare
accept
and
dare
assert
;
but
that
if
I
had
that
right
,
I
would
regard
it
as
a
trust
so
precious
and
so
priceless
,
that
the
undivided
truth
and
fervour
of
my
life
would
poorly
acknowledge
its
worth
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
head
was
still
bent
down
,
the
tears
still
falling
,
and
the
bosom
swelling
with
its
sobs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Florence
!
<EOS>
Dearest
Florence
!
<EOS>
whom
I
called
so
in
my
thoughts
before
I
could
consider
how
presumptuous
and
wild
it
was
.
<EOS>
One
last
time
let
me
call
you
by
your
own
dear
name
,
and
touch
this
gentle
hand
in
token
of
your
sisterly
forgetfulness
of
what
I
have
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
raised
her
head
,
and
spoke
to
him
with
such
a
solemn
sweetness
in
her
eyes
;
with
such
a
calm
,
bright
,
placid
smile
shining
on
him
through
her
tears
;
with
such
a
low
,
soft
tremble
in
her
frame
and
voice
;
that
the
innermost
chords
of
his
heart
were
touched
,
and
his
sight
was
dim
as
he
listened
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Walter
,
I
can
not
forget
it
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
forget
it
,
for
the
world

<EOS>
Are
you
---
are
you
very
poor
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
but
a
wanderer
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
making
voyages
to
live
across
the
sea
.
<EOS>
That
is
my
calling
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Are
you
soon
going
away
again
,
Walter
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Very
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
sat
looking
at
him
for
a
moment
;
then
timidly
put
her
trembling
hand
in
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
take
me
for
your
wife
,
Walter
,
I
will
love
you
dearly

<EOS>
If

will
let
me
go
with
you

I
will
go
to
the

end
without
fear

<EOS>
I
can
give
up
nothing
for
you

<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
resign
,
and
no
one
to
forsake
;
but
all
my
love
and
life
shall
be
devoted
to
you
,

with
my
last
breath
I
will
breathe
your
name
to
God
if
I
have
sense
and
memory
left
.

"
  
<EOS>
He
caught
her
to
his
heart
,
and
laid
her
cheek
against
his
own
,
and
now
,
no
more
repulsed
,
no
more
forlorn
,
she
wept
indeed
,
upon
the
breast
of
her
dear
lover
.
  
<EOS>
Blessed
Sunday
Bells
,
ringing
so
tranquilly
in
their
entranced
and
happy
ears
!
<EOS>
Blessed
Sunday
peace
and
quiet
,
harmonising
with
the
calmness
in
their
souls
,
and
making
holy
air
around
them
!
<EOS>
Blessed
twilight
stealing
on
,
and
shading
her
so
soothingly
and
gravely
,
as
she
falls
asleep
,
like
a
hushed
child
,
upon
the
bosom
she
has
clung
to
!
  
<EOS>
Oh
load
of
love
and
trustfulness
that
lies
so
lightly
there!Aye
,
look
down
on
the
closed
eyes
,
Walter
,
with
a
proudly
tender
gaze
;
for
in
all
the
wide
wide
world
they
seek
but
thee
now
---
only
thee
!
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
remained
in
the
little
parlour
until
it
was
quite
dark
.
<EOS>
He
took
the
chair
on
which
Walter
had
been
sitting
,
and
looked
up
at
the
skylight
,
until
the
day
,
by
little
and
little
,
faded
away
,
and
the
stars
peeped
down
.
<EOS>
He
lighted
a
candle
,
lighted
a
pipe
,
smoked
it
out
,
and
wondered
what
on
earth
was
going
on
up
stairs
,
and
why
they
did
n't
call
him
to
tea
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
came
to
his
side
while
he
was
in
the
height
of
his
wonderment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
lady
lass
!
"
cried
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
and
Wal'r
have
had
a
long
spell
o
'
talk
,
my
beauty
.
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
put
her
little
hand
round
one
of
the
great
buttons
of
his
coat
,
and
said
,
looking
down
into
his
face
:
  
"
Dear
Captain
,
I
want
to
tell
you
something
,
if
you
please
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
raised
his
head
pretty
smartly
,
to
hear
what
it
was
.
<EOS>
Catching
by
this
means
a
more
distinct
view
of
Florence
,
he
pushed
back
his
chair
,
and
himself
with
it
as
far
as
they
could
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
Heart
's
Delight
!
"
cried
the
Captain
,
suddenly
elated
.
"
<EOS>
Is
it
that
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
"
said
Florence
,
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wal'r
!
<EOS>
Husband
!
<EOS>
THAT
?
<EOS>
"
roared
the
Captain
,
tossing
up
his
glazed
hat
into
the
skylight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Florence
,
laughing
and
crying
together
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
immediately
hugged
her
;
and
then
,
picking
up
the
glazed
hat
and
putting
it
on
,
drew
her
arm
through
his
,
and
conducted
her
up
stairs
again
;
where
he
felt
that
the
great
joke
of
his
life
was
now
to
be
made
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
Wal'r
my
lad
!
"
said
the
Captain
,
looking
in
at
the
door
,
with
his
face
like
an
amiable
warming
-
pan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
there
ai
n't
NO
other
character
,
ai
n't
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
like
to
have
suffocated
himself
with
this
pleasantry
,
which
he
repeated
at
least
forty
times
during
tea
;
polishing
his
radiant
face
with
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
,
and
dabbing
his
head
all
over
with
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
in
the
intervals
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
without
a
graver
source
of
enjoyment
to
fall
back
upon
,
when
so
disposed
,
for
he
was
repeatedly
heard
to
say
in
an
under
tone
,
as
he
looked
with
ineffable
delight
at
Walter
and
Florence
:
  
"
<EOS>
Ed'ard
<EOS>
Cuttle
,
my
lad
<EOS>
,
you
never
shaped
a
better
course
in
your
life
,
than
when
you
made
that
there
little
property
over
,
jintly
!

<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
and
the
World
 
<EOS>
WHAT
is
the
proud
man
doing
,
while
the
days
go
by
?
<EOS>
Does
he
ever
think
of
his
daughter
,
or
wonder
where
she
is
gone
?
<EOS>
Does
he
suppose
she
has
come
home
,
and
is
leading
her
old
life
in
the
weary
house
?
<EOS>
No
one
can
answer
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
has
never
utter
her
name
,
since
.
<EOS>
His
household
dread
him
too
much
to
approach
a
subject
on
which
he
is
resolutely
dumb
;
and
the
only
person
who
dares
question
him
,
he
silences
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Paul
!
<EOS>
"
murmurs
his
sister
,
sidling
into
the
room
,
on
the
day
of
Florence
's
departure
,
"
your
wife
!
<EOS>
that
upstart
woman
!
<EOS>
Is
it
possible
that
what
I
hear
confusedly
,
is
true
,
and
that
this
is
her
return
for
your
unparalleled
devotion
to
her
;
extending
,
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
even
to
the
sacrifice
of
your
own
relations
,
to
her
caprices
and
haughtiness
?
<EOS>
My
poor
brother
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
speech
,
feelingly
reminiscent
of
her
not
having
been
asked
to
dinner
on
the
day
of
the
first
party
,
Mrs
Chick
makes
great
use
of
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
and
falls
on
Mr
Dombey
's
neck
.
<EOS>
But
Mr
Dombey
frigidly
lifts
her
off
,
and
hands
her
to
a
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
,
Louisa
,
"
he
says
,
"
for
this
mark
of
your
affection
;
but
desire
that
our
conversation
may
refer
to
any
other
subject
.
<EOS>
When
I
bewail
my
fate
,
Louisa
,
or
express
myself
as
being
in
want
of
consolation
,
you
can
offer
it
,
if
you
will
have
the
goodness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Paul
,
"
rejoins
his
sister
,
with
her
handkerchief
to
her
face
,
and
shaking
her
head
,
"
<EOS>
I
know
your
great
spirit
,
and
will
say
no
more
upon
a
theme
so
painful
and
revolting
;
"
on
the
heads
of
which
two
adjectives
,
Mrs
Chick
visits
scathing
indignation
;
"
but
pray
let
me
ask
you
---
though
I
dread
to
hear
something
that
will
shock
and
distress
me
---
that
unfortunate
child
Florence
---
"
  
"
Louisa
!
"
says
her
brother
,
sternly
,
"
silence
.
<EOS>
Not
another
word
of
this
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
can
only
shake
her
head
,
and
use
her
handkerchief
,
and
moan
over
degenerate
Dombeys
,
who
are
no
Dombeys
.
<EOS>
But
whether
Florence
has
been
inculpated
in
the
flight
of
Edith
,
or
has
followed
her
,
or
has
done
too
much
,
or
too
little
,
or
anything
,
or
nothing
,
she
has
not
the
least
idea
.
  
<EOS>
He
goes
on
,
without
deviation
,
keeping
his
thoughts
and
feelings
close
within
his
own
breast
,
and
imparting
them
to
no
one
.
<EOS>
He
makes
no
search
for
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
may
think
that
she
is
with
his
sister
,
or
that
she
is
under
his
own
roof
.
<EOS>
He
may
think
of
her
constantly
,
or
he
may
never
think
about
her
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
one
for
any
sign
he
makes
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
is
sure
;
he
does
not
think
that
he
has
lost
her
.
<EOS>
He
has
no
suspicion
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
He
has
lived
too
long
shut
up
in
his
towering
supremacy
,
seeing
her
,
a
patient
gentle
creature
,
in
the
path
below
it
,
to
have
any
fear
of
that
.
<EOS>
Shaken
as
he
is
by
his
disgrace
,
he
is
not
yet
humbled
to
the
level
earth
.
<EOS>
The
root
is
broad
and
deep
,
and
in
the
course
of

It

Old

(

that
the

Undoubtedly

<EOS>
"
In
point

it

quite
a
self

evident
sort

thing

<EOS>
I
am
extremely
anxious
,
Major
,
that
my
friend
Dombey
should
hear
me
express
my
very
great
astonishment
and
regret
,
that
my
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
,
who
was
possessed
of
every
qualification
to
make
a
man
happy
,
should
have
so
far
forgotten
what
was
due
to
---
in
point
of
fact
,
to
the
world
---
as
to
commit
herself
in
such
a
very
extraordinary
manner
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
in
a
devilish
state
of
depression
ever
since
;
and
said
indeed
to
Long
Saxby
last
night
---
man
of
six
foot
ten
,
with
whom
my
friend
Dombey
is
probably
acquainted
---
that
it
had
upset
me
in
a
confounded
way
,
and
made
me
bilious
.
<EOS>
It
induces
a
man
to
reflect
,
this
kind
of
fatal
catastrophe
,
"
says
Cousin
Feenix
,
"
that
events
do
occur
in
quite
a
providential
manner
;
for
if
my
Aunt
had
been
living
at
the
time
,
I
think
the
effect
upon
a
devilish
lively
woman
like
herself
,
would
have
been
prostration
,
and
that
she
would
have
fallen
,
in
point
of
fact
,
a
victim
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Dombey
!

"
says
the
Major
,
resuming
his
discourse
with
great
energy

<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon

"
interposes
Cousin
Feenix
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Allow
me
another
word
.
<EOS>
My
friend
Dombey
will
permit
me
to
say
,
that
if
any
circumstance
could
have
added
to
the
most
infernal
state
of
pain
in
which
I
find
myself
on
this
occasion
,
it
would
be
the
natural
amazement
of
the
world
at
my
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
(
as
I
must
still
beg
leave
to
call
her
)
being
supposed
to
have
so
committed
herself
with
a
person
---
man
with
white
teeth
,
in
point
of
fact
---
of
very
inferior
station
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
But
while
I
must
,
rather
peremptorily
,
request
my
friend
Dombey
not
to
criminate
my
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
until
her
criminality
is
perfectly
established
,
I
beg
to
assure
my
friend
Dombey
that
the
family
I
represent
,
and
which
is
now
almost
extinct
(
devilish
sad
reflection
for
a
man
)
,
will
interpose
no
obstacle
in
his
way
,
and
will
be
happy
to
assent
to
any
honourable
course
of
proceeding
,
with
a
view
to
the
future
,
that
he
may
point
out
.
<EOS>
I
trust
my
friend
Dombey
will
give
me
credit
for
the
intentions
by
which
I
am
animated
in
this
very
melancholy
affair
,
and
---
a
---
in
point
of
fact
,
I
am
not
aware
that
I
need
trouble
my
friend
Dombey
with
any
further
observations

<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
bows
,
without
raising
his
eyes
,
and
is
silent
.

Mr

says
the
Major

"
you
will
guess
the
rest

<EOS>
I
speak
out

prematurely

always
spoken
out

returns
Mr

Where

inquires
the
Major
,
after
gasping
and
looking
at
him
,
for
a
minute
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know

<EOS>

<EOS>

Any

asks
the
Major

<EOS>
"
Yes

<EOS>
"
Dombey
,
I
am
rejoiced
to
hear
it

the

I
congratulate
you

You

you

replies
Mr

my

into
any
further
detail
at

The
intelligence
is
of
a
singular
kind

singularly
obtained

<EOS>
It

turn
out

valueless

at

<EOS>
Although
this
is
but
a
dry
reply
to
the
Major
's
purple
enthusiasm
,
the
Major
receives
it
graciously
,
and
is
delighted
to
think
that
the
world
has
such
a
fair
prospect
of
soon
receiving
its
due

<EOS>
Cousin
Feenix
is
then
presented
with
his
meed
of
acknowledgment
by
the
husband
of
his
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
,
and
Cousin
Feenix
and
Major
Bagstock
retire
,
leaving
that
husband
to
the
world
again
,
and
to
ponder
at
leisure
on
their
representation
of
its
state
of
mind
concerning
his
affairs
,
and
on
its
just
and
reasonable
expectations
.
  
<EOS>
But
who
sits
in
the
housekeeper
's
room
,
shedding
tears
,
and
talking
to
Mrs
Pipchin
in
a
low
tone
,
with
uplifted
hands
?
<EOS>
It
is
a
lady
with
her
face
concealed
in
a
very
close
black
bonnet
,
which
appears
not
to
belong
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
is
Miss
Tox
,
who
has
borrowed
this
disguise
from
her
servant
,
and
comes
from
Princess
's
Place
,
thus
secretly
,
to
revive
her
old
acquaintance
with
Mrs
Pipchin
,
in
order
to
get
certain
information
of
the
state
of
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
does
he
bear
it
,
my
dear
creature

"
asks
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
says
Mrs
Pipchin
,
in
her
snappish
way
,
"
he
's
pretty
much
as
usual

<EOS>
"
  
"
Externally
,
"
suggests
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
he
feels
within
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
's
hard
grey
eye
looks
doubtful
as
she
answers
,
in
three
distinct
jerks
,
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Perhaps
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
tell
you
my
mind
,
Lucretia
,
"
says
Mrs
Pipchin
;
she
still
calls
Miss
Tox
Lucretia
,
on
account
of
having
made
her
first
experiments
in
the
child
-
quelling
line
of
business
on
that
lady
,
when
an
unfortunate
and
weazen
little
girl
of
tender
years
;
"
to
tell
you
my
mind
,
Lucretia
<EOS>
,
I
think
it
's
a
good
riddance
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
any
of
your
brazen
faces
here
,
myself
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Brazen
indeed
!
<EOS>
Well
may
you
say
brazen
,
Mrs
Pipchin
!
<EOS>
"
returns
Miss
Tox
.
"
<EOS>
To
leave
him
!
<EOS>
Such
a
noble
figure
of
a
man
!
"
<EOS>
And
here
Miss
Tox
is
overcome
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
noble
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
observes
Mrs
Pipchin
,
irascibly
rubbing
her
nose
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
know
this
---
that
when
people
meet
with
trails
,
they
must
bear
'em
.
<EOS>
Hoity
,
toity!I
have
had
enough
to
bear
myself
,
in
my
time
!
<EOS>
What
a
fuss
there
is
!
<EOS>
She
's
gone
and
well
got
rid
of
.
<EOS>
Nobody
wants
her
back
,
I
should
think
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
hint
of
the
Peruvian
Mines
,
causes
Miss
Tox
to
rise
to
go
away
;
when
Mrs
Pipchin
rings
the
bell
for
Towlinson
to
show
her
out
.
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
,
not
having
seen
Miss
Tox
for
ages
,
grins
,
and
hopes
she
's
well
;
observing
that
he
did
n't
know
her
at
first
,
in
that
bonnet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
,
Towlinson
,
I
thank
you
,
"
says
Miss
Tox
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
you
'll
have
the
goodness
,
when
you
happen
to
see
me
here
,
not
to
mention
it

<EOS>
My
visits
are
merely
to
Mrs
Pipchin
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
good

says
Towlinson
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shocking
circumstances
occur

says
Miss
Tox
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
much
so
indeed
,
Miss
,
"
rejoins
Towlinson
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Towlinson
,
"
says
Miss
Tox
,
who
,
in
her
instruction
of
the
Toodle
family
,
has
acquired
an
admonitorial
tone
,
and
a
habit
of
improving
passing
occasions
,
"
that
what
has
happened
here
,
will
be
a
warning
to
you
,
Towlinson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Miss
,
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
,
"
says
Towlinson
.
  
<EOS>
He
appears
to
be
falling
into
a
consideration
of
the
manner
in
which
this
warning
ought
to
operate
in
his
particular
case
,
when
the
vinegary
Mrs
Pipchin
,
suddenly
stirring
him
up
with
a
"
What
are
you
doing
?
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
show
the
lady
to
the
door
?
<EOS>
"
he
ushers
Miss
Tox
forth
.
<EOS>
As
she
passes
Mr
Dombey
's
room
,
she
shrinks
into
the
inmost
depths
of
the
black
bonnet
,
and
walks
on

;
and
there
is
not
another
atom
in
the
world
which
haunts
him
so
<EOS>
,
that
feels
such
sorrow
and
solicitude
about
him
,
as
Miss
Tox
takes
out
under
the
black
bonnet
into
the
street
,
and
tries
to
carry
home
shadowed
from
the
newly
-
lighted
lamps
.
  
<EOS>
But
Miss
Tox
is
not
a
part
of
Mr
Dombey
's
world
.
<EOS>
She
comes
back
every
evening
at
dusk
;
adding
clogs
and
an
umbrella
to
the
bonnet
on
wet
nights
;
and
bears
the
grins
of
Towlinson
,
and
the
huffs
and
rebuffs
of
Mrs
Pipchin
,
and
all
to
ask
how
he
does
,
and
how
he
bears
his
misfortune
:
but
she
has
nothing
to
do
with
Mr
Dombey
's
world
.
<EOS>
Exacting
and
harassing
as
ever
,
it
goes
on
without
her
;
and
she
,
a
by
no
means
bright
or
particular
star
,
moves
in
her
little
orbit
in
the
corner
of
another
system
,
and
knows
it
quite
well
,
and
comes
,
and
cries
,
and
goes
away
,
and
is
satisfied
.
<EOS>
Verily
Miss
Tox
is
easier
of
satisfaction
than
the
world
that
troubles
Mr
Dombey
so
much
!
  
<EOS>
At
the
Counting
House
,
the
clerks
discuss
the
great
disaster
in
all
its
lights
and
shades
,
but
chiefly
wonder
who
will
get
Mr
Carker
's
place
.
<EOS>
They
are
generally
of
opinion
that
it
will
be
shorn
of
some
of
its
emoluments
,
and
made
uncomfortable
by
newly
-
devised
checks
and
restriction
;
and
those
who
are
beyond
all
hope
of
it
,
are
quite
sure
they
would
rather
not
have
it
,
and
do
n't
at
all
envy
the
person
for
whom
it
may
prove
to
be
reserved
.
<EOS>
Nothing
like
the
prevailing
sensation
has
existed
in
the
Counting
House
since
Mr
Dombey
's
little
son
died
;
but
all
such
excitements
there
take
a
social
,
not
to
say
a
jovial
turn
,
and
lead
to
the
cultivation
of
good
fellowship
.
<EOS>
A
reconciliation
is
established
on
this
propitious
occasion
between
the
acknowledged
wit
of
the
Counting
House
and
an
aspiring
rival
,
with
whom
he
has
been
at
deadly
feud
for
months
;
and
a
little
dinner
being
proposed
,
in
commemoration
of
their
happily
restored
amity
,
takes
place
at
a
neighbouring
tavern
;
the
wit
in
the
chair
;
the
rival
acting
as
Vice
-
President
.
<EOS>
The
orations
following
the
removal
of
the
cloth
are
opened
by
the
Chair
,
who
says
,
Gentlemen
,
he
ca
n't
disguise
from
himself
that
this
is
not
a
time
for
private
dissensions
.
<EOS>
Recent
occurrences
to
which
he
need
not
more
particularly
allude
,
but
which
have
not
been
altogether
without
notice
in
some
Sunday
Papers
,
and
in
a
daily
paper
which
he
need
not
name
(
here
every
other
member
of
the
company
names
it
in
an
audible
murmur
)
,
have
caused
him
to
reflect
;
and
he
feels
that
for
him
and
Robinson
to
have
any
personal
differences
at
such
a
moment
,
would
be
for
ever
to
deny
that
good
feeling
in
the
general
cause
,
for
which
he
has
reason
to
think
and
hope
that
the
gentlemen
in
Dombey
's
House
have
always
been
distinguished
.
<EOS>
Robinson
replies
to
this
like
a
man
and
a
brother
;
and
one
gentleman
who
has
been
in
the
office
three
years
,
under
continual
notice
to
quit
on
account
of
lapses
in
his
arithmetic
,
appears
in
a
perfectly
new
light
,
suddenly
bursting
out
with
a
thrilling
speech
,
in
which
he
says
,
May
their
respected
chief
never
again
know
the
desolation
which
has
fallen
on
his
hearth
!
<EOS>
and
says
a
great
variety
of
things
,
beginning
with
"
May
he
never
again
,
"
which
are
received
with
thunders
of
applause
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
a
most
delightful
evening
is
passed
,
only
interrupted
by
a
difference
between
two
juniors
,
who
,
quarrelling
about
the
probable
amount
of
Mr
Carker
's
late
receipts
per
annum
,
defy
each
other
with
decanters
,
and
are
taken
out
greatly
excited
.
<EOS>
Soda
water
is
in
general
request
at
the
office
next
day
,
and
most
of
the
party
deem
the
bill
an
imposition
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
Perch
,
the
messenger
,
he
is
in
a
fair
way
of
being
ruined
for
life
.
<EOS>
He
finds
himself
again
constantly
in
bars
of
public
-
houses
,
being
treated
and
lying
dreadfully
.
<EOS>
It
appears
that
he
met
everybody
concerned
in
the
late
transaction
,
everywhere
,
and
said
to
them
,
"
Sir
,
"
or
"
Madam
,
"
as
the
case
was
"
why
do
you
look
so
pale
?
"
at
which
each
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
,
and
said
,
"
Oh
,
Perch
!
"
and
ran
away
.
<EOS>
Either
the
consciousness
of
these
enormities
,
or
the
reaction
consequent
on
liquor
,
reduces
Mr
Perch
to
an
extreme
state
of
low
spirits
at
that
hour
of
the
evening
when
he
usually
seeks
consolation
in
the
society
of
Mrs
Perch
at
Balls
Pond
;
and
Mrs
Perch
frets
a
good
deal
,
for
she
fears
his
confidence
in
woman
is
shaken
now
,
and
that
he
half
expects
on
coming
home
at
night
to
find
her
gone
off
with
some
Viscount
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
servants
are
becoming
,
at
the
same
time
,
quite
dissipated
,
and
unfit
for
other
service
.
<EOS>
They
have
hot
suppers
every
night
,
and
"
talk
it
over
"
with
smoking
drinks
upon
the
board
.
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
is
always
maudlin
after
halfpast
ten
,
and
frequently
begs
to
know
whether
he
did
n't
say
that
no
good
would
ever
come
of
living
in
a
corner
house
?
<EOS>
They
whisper
about
Miss
Florence
,
and
wonder
where
she
is
;
but
agree
that
if
Mr
Dombey
do
n't
know
,
Mrs
Dombey
does
.
<EOS>
This
brings
them
to
the
latter
,
of
whom
Cook
says
,
She
had
a
stately
way
though
,
had
n't
she
?
<EOS>
But
she
was
too
high
!
<EOS>
They
all
agree
that
she
was
too
high
,
and
Mr
Towlinson
's
old
flame
,
the
housemaid
(
who
is
very
virtuous
)
,
entreats
that
you
will
never
talk
to
her
any
more
about
people
who
hold
their
heads
up
,
as
if
the
ground
was
n't
good
enough
for
'em
.
  
<EOS>
Everything
that
is
said
and
done
about
it
,
except
by
Mr
Dombey
,
is
done
in
chorus
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
and
the
world
are
alone
together

Secret
Intelligence
 
<EOS>
GOOD
<EOS>
Mrs
Brown
and
her
daughter
Alice
kept
silent
company
together
,
in
their
own
dwelling
.
<EOS>
It
was
early
in
the
evening
,
and
late
in
the
spring
.
<EOS>
But
a
few
days
had
elapsed
since
Mr
Dombey
had
told
major
Bagstock
of
his
singular
intelligence
,
singularly
obtained
,
which
might
turn
out
to
be
valueless
,
and
might
turn
out
to
be
true
;
and
the
world
was
not
satisfied
yet
.
  
<EOS>
The
mother
and
daughter
sat
for
a
long
time
without
inter
-
changing
a
word
:
almost
without
motion
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
's
face
was
shrewdly
anxious
and
expectant
;
that
of
her
daughter
was
expectant
too
,
but
in
a
less
sharp
degree
,
and
sometimes
it
darkened
,
as
if
with
gathering
disappointment
and
incredulity
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
,
without
heeding
these
changes
in
its
expression
,
though
her
eyes
were
often
turned
towards
it
,
sat
mumbling
and
munching
,
and
listening
confidently
.
  
<EOS>
Their
abode
,
though
poor
and
miserable
,
was
not
so
utterly
wretched
as
in
the
days
when
only
Good
Mrs
Brown
inhabited
it
.
<EOS>
Some
few
attempts
at
cleanliness
and
order
were
manifest
,
though
made
in
a
reckless
,
gipsy
way
,
that
might
have
connected
them
,
at
a
glance
,
with
the
younger
woman
.
<EOS>
The
shades
of
evening
thickened
and
deepened
as
the
two
kept
silence
,
until
the
blackened
walls
were
nearly
lost
in
the
prevailing
gloom
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Alice
broke
the
silence
which
had
lasted
so
long
,
and
said
:
  
"
You
may
give
him
up
,
mother
.
<EOS>
He
'll
not
come
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Death
give
him
up
!
"
returned
the
old
woman
,
impatiently
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
come
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
him
,
"
returned
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
doomsday
,
"
said
the
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
I
'm
in
my
second
childhood
,
I
know
!
"
croaked
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
respect
and
duty
that
I
get
from
my
own
gal
,
but
I
'm
wiser
than
you
take
me
for
.
<EOS>
He
'll
come
.
<EOS>
T'other
day
when
I
touched
his
coat
in
the
street
,
he
looked
round
as
if
I
was
a
toad
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
,
to
see
him
when
I
said
their
names
,
and
asked
him
if
he
'd
like
to
find
out
where
they
was
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
so
angry
?
"
<EOS>
asked
her
daughter
,
roused
to
interest
in
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Angry
?
<EOS>
ask
if
it
was
bloody
.
<EOS>
That
's
more
like
the
word
.
<EOS>
Angry
?
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
To
call
that
only
angry
!
"
said
the
old
woman
,
hobbling
to
the
cupboard
,
and
lighting
a
candle
,
which
displayed
the
workings
of
her
mouth
to
ugly
advantage
,
as
she
brought
it
to
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
I
might
as
well
call
your
face
only
angry
,
when
you
think
or
talk
about
'
em
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
something
different
from
that
,
truly
,
as
she
sat
as
still
as
a
crouched
tigress
,
with
her
kindling
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
"
said
the
old
woman
,
triumphantly
.
<EOS>
"
I
hear
a
step
coming
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
the
tread
of
any
one
that
lives
about
here
,
or
comes
this
way
often
.
<EOS>
We
do
n't
walk
like
that
.
<EOS>
We
should
grow
proud
on
such
neighbours
!
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
are
right
,
mother
,
"
replied
Alice
,
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Peace
!
open
the
door
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
drew
herself
within
her
shawl
,
and
gathered
it
about
her
,
the
old
woman
complied
;
and
peering
out
,
and
beckoning
,
gave
admission
to
Mr
Dombey
,
who
stopped
when
he
had
set
his
foot
within
the
door
,
and
looked
distrustfully
around
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
poor
place
for
a
great
gentleman
like
your
worship
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
curtseying
and
chattering
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
so
,
but
there
's
no
harm
in
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
that
?
"
asked
Mr
Dombey
,
looking
at
her
companion
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
my
handsome
daughter
,
"
said
the
old
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
worship
wo
n't
mind
her
.
<EOS>
She
knows
all
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
shadow
fell
upon
his
face
not
less
expressive
than
if
he
had
groaned
aloud
,
"
Who
does
not
know
all
about
it
!
"
<EOS>
but
he
looked
at
her
steadily
,
and
<EOS>
she
,
without
any
acknowledgment
of
his
presence
,
looked
at
him
.
<EOS>
The
shadow
on
his
face
was
darker
when
he
turned
his
glance
away
from
her
;
and
even
then
it
wandered
back
again
,
furtively
,
as
if
he
were
haunted
by
her
bold
eyes
,
and
some
remembrance
they
inspired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Woman
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
to
the
old
witch
who
was
chuckling
and
leering
close
at
his
elbow
,
and
who
,
when
he
turned
to
address
her
,
pointed
stealthily
at
her
daughter
,
and
rubbed
her
hands
,
and
pointed
again
,
"
Woman
!
<EOS>
I
believe
that
I
am
weak
and
forgetful
of
my
station
in
coming
here
,
but
you
know
why
I
come
,
and
what
you
offered
when
you
stopped
me
in
the
street
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
What
is
it
that
you
have
to
tell
me
concerning
what
I
want
to
know
;
and
how
does
it
happen
that
I
can
find
voluntary
intelligence
in
a
hovel
like
this
,
"
with
a
disdainful
glance
about
him
,
"
when
I
have
exerted
my
power
and
means
to
obtain
it
in
vain
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
during
which
he
had
observed
her
,
sternly
,
"
that
you
are
so
audacious
as
to
mean
to
trifle
with
me
,
or
endeavour
to
impose
upon
me
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
have
that
purpose
,
you
had
better
stop
on
the
threshold
of
your
scheme
.
<EOS>
My
humour
is
not
a
trifling
one
,
and
my
acknowledgment
will
be
severe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
a
proud
,
hard
gentleman
!
<EOS>
"
chuckled
the
old
woman
,
shaking
her
head
,
and
rubbing
her
shrivelled
hands
,
"
oh
hard
,
hard
,
hard
!
<EOS>
But
you
worship
shall
see
with
your
own
eyes
and
hear
with
your
own
ears
;
not
with
ours
---
and
if
your
worship
's
put
upon
their
track
,
you
wo
n't
mind
paying
something
for
it
,
will
you
,
honourable
deary
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Money
,
"
returned
Mr
Dombey
,
apparently
relieved
,
and
reassured
by
this
inquiry
,
"
will
bring
about
unlikely
things
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
It
may
turn
even
means
as
unexpected
and
unpromising
as
these
,
to
account
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
For
and
reliable
information
I
receive
,
I
will
pay
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
have
the
information
first
,
and
judge
for
myself
of
its
value
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
nothing
more
powerful
than
money
?
"
asked
the
younger
woman
,
without
rising
,
or
altering
her
attitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
here
,
I
should
imagine
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
know
of
something
that
is
more
powerful
elsewhere
,
as
I
judge
,
"
she
returned
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
nothing
of
a
woman
's
anger
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
saucy
tongue
,
Jade
,
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
usually
,
"
she
answered
,
without
any
show
of
emotion
:
"
I
speak
to
you
now
,
that
you
may
understand
us
better
,
and
rely
more
on
us

<EOS>
A
woman
's
anger
is
pretty
much
the
same
here
,
as
in
your
fine
house
.
<EOS>
I
am
angry
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
so
,
many
years
.
<EOS>
I
have
as
good
cause
for
my
anger
as
you
have
for
yours
,
and
its
object
is
the
same
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
started
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
and
looked
at
her
with
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
kind
of
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wide
as
the
distance
may
seem
between
us
,
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
How
it
is
so
,
is
no
matter
;
that
is
my
story
,
and
I
keep
my
story
to
myself
.
<EOS>
I
would
bring
you
and
him
together
,
because
I
have
a
rage
against
him
.
<EOS>
My
mother
there
,
is
avaricious
and
poor
;
and
she
would
sell
any
tidings
she
could
glean
,
or
anything
,
or
anybody
,
for
money
.
<EOS>
It
is
fair
enough
,
perhaps
,
that
you
should
pay
her
some
,
if
she
can
help
you
to
what
you
want
to
know
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
not
my
motive
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
what
mine
is
,
and
it
would
be
as
strong
and
all
-
sufficient
with
me
if
you
haggled
and
bargained
with
her
for
a
sixpence
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
My
saucy
tongue
says
no
more
,
if
you
wait
here
till
sunrise
to
-
morrow
.

<EOS>
The
old
woman
,
who
had
shown
great
uneasiness
during
this
speech
,
which
had
a
tendency
to
depreciate
her
expected
gains
,
pulled
Mr
Dombey
softly
by
the
sleeve
,
and
whispered
to
him
not
to
mind
her
.
<EOS>
He
glanced
at
them
both
,
by
turns
,
with
a
haggard
look
,
and
said
,
in
a
deeper
voice
than
was
usual
with
him
:
  
"
Go
on
---
what
do
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
not
so
fast
,
your
worship
!
<EOS>
we
must
wait
for
some
one
,
"
answered
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
to
be
got
from
some
one
else
---
wormed
out
---
screwed
and
twisted
from
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
said
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Patience
,
"
she
croaked
,
laying
her
hand
,
like
a
claw
,
upon
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Patience
.
<EOS>
I
'll
get
at
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
can
!
<EOS>
If
he
was
to
hold
it
back
from
me
,
"
said
Good
Mrs
Brown
,
crooking
her
ten
fingers
,
"
I
'd
tear
it
out
of
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
followed
her
with
his
eyes
as
she
hobbled
to
the
door
,
and
looked
out
again
:
and
then
his
glance
sought
her
daughter
;
but
she
remained
impassive
,
silent
,
and
regardless
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
tell
me
,
woman
,
"
he
said
,
when
the
bent
figure
of
Mrs
Brown
came
back
,
shaking
its
head
and
chattering
to
itself
,
"
that
there
is
another
person
expected
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
"
said
the
old
woman
,
looking
up
into
his
face
,
and
nodding
.
  
<EOS>
"
From
whom
you
are
to
exact
the
intelligence
that
is
to
be
useful
to
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
nodding
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
stranger
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Chut
!
"
said
the
old
woman
,
with
a
shrill
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
signifies
!
<EOS>
Well
,
well
;
no
.
<EOS>
No
stranger
to
your
worship
.
<EOS>
But
he
wo
n't
see
you
.
<EOS>
He
'd
be
afraid
of
you
,
and
would
n't
talk
.
<EOS>
You
'll
stand
behind
that
door
,
and
judge
him
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
We
do
n't
ask
to
be
believed
on
trust
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
Your
worship
doubts
the
room
behind
the
door
?
<EOS>
Oh
the
suspicion
of
you
rich
gentlefolks
!
<EOS>
Look
at
it
,
then
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
sharp
eye
had
detected
an
involuntary
expression
of
this
feeling
on
his
part
,
which
was
not
unreasonable
under
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
In
satisfaction
of
it
she
now
took
the
candle
to
the
door
she
spoke
of
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
looked
in
;
assured
himself
that
it
was
an
empty
,
crazy
room
;
and
signed
to
her
to
put
the
light
back
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
,
"
he
asked
,
"
before
this
person
comes
?
"
  
"
Not
long
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Would
your
worship
sit
down
for
a
few
odd
minutes
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
made
no
answer
;
but
began
pacing
the
room
with
an
irresolute
air
,
as
if
he
were
undecided
whether
to
remain
or
depart
,
and
as
if
he
had
some
quarrel
with
himself
for
being
there
at
all
.
<EOS>
But
soon
his
tread
grew
slower
and
heavier
,
and
his
face
more
sternly
thoughtful
:
as
the
object
with
which
he
had
come
,
fixed
itself
in
his
mind
,
and
dilated
there
again
.
  
<EOS>
While
he
thus
walked
up
and
down
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
,
Mrs
Brown
,
in
the
chair
from
which
she
had
risen
to
receive
him
,
sat
listening
anew
.
<EOS>
The
monotony
of
his
step
,
or
the
uncertainty
of
age
,
made
her
so
slow
of
hearing
,
that
a
footfall
without
had
sounded
in
her
daughter
's
ears
for
some
moments
,
and
she
had
looked
up
hastily
to
warn
her
mother
of
its
approach
,
before
the
old
woman
was
roused
by
it
.
<EOS>
But
then
she
started
from
her
seat
,
and
whispering
"
Here
he
is
!
"
<EOS>
hurried
her
visitor
to
his
place
of
observation
,
and
put
a
bottle
and
glass
upon
the
table
,
with
such
alacrity
as
to
be
ready
to
fling
her
arms
round
the
neck
of
Rob
the
Grinder
on
his
appearance
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
here
's
my
bonny
boy
,
"
cried
Mrs
Brown
,
"
at
last
!
<EOS>
---
oho
,
oho
!
<EOS>
You
're
like
my
own
son
,
Robby
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
Misses
Brown
!
"
remonstrated
the
Grinder
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Don't!Can't
<EOS>
you
be
fond
of
a
cove
without
squeedging
and
throttling
of
him
?
<EOS>
Take
care
of
the
birdcage
in
my
hand
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thinks
of
a
birdcage
,
afore
me
!
"
cried
the
old
woman
,
apostrophizing
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Me
that
feels
more
than
a
mother
for
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'm
sure
I
'm
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
Misses
Brown
,
"
said
the
unfortunate
youth
,
greatly
aggravated
;
"
but
you
're
so
jealous
of
a
cove
.
<EOS>
I
'm
very
fond
of
you
myself
,
and
all
that
,
of
course
;
but
I
do
n't
smother
you
,
do
I
,
Misses
Brown
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
and
spoke
as
if
he
would
have
been
far
from
objecting
to
do
so
,
however
,
on
a
favourable
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
to
talk
about
birdcages
,
too
!
<EOS>
"
whimpered
the
Grinder
.
<EOS>
"
As
if
that
was
a
crime
!
<EOS>
Why
,
look'ee
here
!
<EOS>
Do
you
know
who
this
belongs
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
Master
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
old
woman
with
a
grin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
replied
the
Grinder
,
lifting
a
large
cage
tied
up
in
a
wrapper
,
on
the
table
,
and
untying
it
with
his
teeth
and
hands
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
our
parrot
,
this
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Carker
's
parrot
,
Rob
?
"
  
"
Will
you
hold
your
tongue
,
Misses
Brown
?
"
returned
the
goaded
Grinder
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
go
naming
names
for
?
<EOS>
I
'm
blest
,
"
said
Rob
,
pulling
his
hair
with
both
hands
in
the
exasperation
of
his
feelings
,
"
if
she
an't
enough
to
make
a
cove
run
wild
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
Do
you
snub
me
,
thankless
boy
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
old
woman
,
with
ready
vehemence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
,
Misses
Brown
,
no
!
"
returned
the
Grinder
,
with
tears
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Was
there
ever
such
a
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
I
dote
upon
you
,
Misses
Brown
?

"
  
"
Do
you
,
sweet
Rob
?
<EOS>
Do
you
truly
,
chickabiddy
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
that
,
Mrs
Brown
held
him
in
her
fond
embrace
once
more
;
and
did
not
release
him
until
he
had
made
several
violent
and
ineffectual
struggles
with
his
legs
,
and
his
hair
was
standing
on
end
all
over
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
returned
the
Grinder
,
"
what
a
thing
it
is
to
be
perfectly
pitched
into
with
affection
like
this
here
.
<EOS>
I
wish
she
wasHow
have
you
been
,
Misses
Brown
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Not
here
since
this
night
week
!
"
said
the
old
woman
,
contemplating
him
with
a
look
of
reproach
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
,
Misses
Brown
,
"
returned
the
Grinder
,
"
I
said
to
-
night
's
a
week
,
that
I
'd
come
to

night

did
n't
I
?
<EOS>
And
here
I
am

<EOS>
How
you
do
go
on
!
<EOS>
I
wish
you
'd
be
a
little
rational
,
Misses
Brown
.
<EOS>
I
'm
hoarse
with
saying
things
in
my
defence
,
and
my
very
face
is
shiny
with
being
hugged
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
rubbed
it
hard
with
his
sleeve
,
as
if
to
remove
the
tender
polish
in
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Drink
a
little
drop
to
comfort
you
,
my
Robin
,

said
the
old
woman
,
filling
the
glass
from
the
bottle
and
giving
it
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
Misses
Brown
,

returned
the
Grinder
.
<EOS>
"
Here
's
your
health

And
long
may
you
---
et
ceterer

<EOS>

Which
to
judge
from
the
expression
of
his
face
,
did
not
include
any
very
choice
blessing
.
"
<EOS>
And
here
's
her
health
,
"
said
the
Grinder
,
glancing
at
Alice
,
who
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
,
as
it
seemed
to
him
,
on
the
wall
behind
him
,
but
in
reality
on
Mr
Dombey
's
face
at
the
door
,
"
and
wishing
her
the
same
and
many
of
'
em
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
drained
the
glass
to
these
two
sentiments
,
and
set
it
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
say
,
Misses
Brown
!
"
<EOS>
he
proceeded
.
"
<EOS>
To
go
on
a
little
rational
now
.
<EOS>
You
're
a
judge
of
birds
,
and
up
to
their
ways
,
as
I
know
to
my
cost
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cost
!
"
repeated
Mrs
Brown
.
  
<EOS>
"
Satisfaction
,
I
mean
,
"
returned
the
Grinder
.
<EOS>
"
How
you
do
take
up
a
cove
,
Misses
Brown
!
<EOS>
You
've
put
it
all
out
of
my
head
again
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Judge
of
birds

Robby

"
suggested
the
old
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
the
Grinder
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
've
got
to
take
care
of
this
parrot
---
certain
things
being
sold
,
and
a
certain
establishment
broke
up
---
and
as
I
do
n't
want
no
notice
took
at
present
,
I
wish
you
'd
attend
to
her
for
a
week
or
so
,
and
give
her
board
and
lodging
<EOS>
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
If
I
must
come
backwards
and
forwards
,
"
mused
the
Grinder
with
a
dejected
face
,
"
I
may
as
well
have
something
to
come
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Something
to
come
for
?

screamed
the
old
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Besides
you
,
I
mean
,
Misses
Brown
,
"
returned
the
craven
Rob
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
that
I
want
any
inducement
but
yourself
,
Misses
Brown
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
begin
again
,
for
goodness
'
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
do
n't
care
for
me
!
<EOS>
He
do
n't
care
for
me
,
as
I
care
for
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Brown
,
lifting
up
her
skinny
hands
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
'll
take
care
of
his
bird
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Take
good
care
of
it
too
,
you
know
,
Mrs
Brown
,
"
said
Rob
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
was
so
much
as
to
stroke
its
feathers
once
the
wrong
way
,
I
believe
it
would
be
found
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
so
sharp
as
that
,
Rob
?
"
said
Mrs
Brown
,
quickly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sharp
,
Misses
Brown
!
"
repeated
Rob
.
"
<EOS>
But
this
is
not
to
be
talked
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
Checking
himself
abruptly
,
and
not
without
a
fearful
glance
across
the
room
,
rob
filled
the
glass
again
,
and
having
slowly
emptied
it
,
shook
his
head
,
and
began
to
draw
his
fingers
across
and
across
the
wires
of
the
parrot
's
cage
by
way
of
a
diversion
from
the
dangerous
theme
that
had
just
been
broached
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
eyed
him
slily
,
and
hitching
her
chair
nearer
his
,
and
looking
in
at
the
parrot
,
who
came
down
from
the
gilded
dome
at
her
call
,
said
:
  
"
Out
of
place
now
,
Robby
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
you
mind
,
Misses
Brown
,
"
returned
the
Grinder
,
shortly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Board
wages
,
perhaps
,
Rob
?
"
said
Mrs
Brown
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
Polly
!
"
said
the
Grinder
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
darted
a
glance
at
him
that
might
have
warned
him
to
consider
his
ears
in
danger
,
but
it
was
his
turn
to
look
in
at
the
parrot
now
,
and
however
expressive
his
imagination
may
have
made
her
angry
scowl
,
it
was
unseen
by
his
bodily
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
Master
did
n't
take
you
with
him
,
Rob
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
in
a
wheedling
voice
,
but
with
increased
malignity
of
aspect
.
  
<EOS>
Rob
was
so
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
the
parrot
,
and
in
trolling
his
forefinger
on
the
wires
,
that
he
made
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
had
her
clutch
within
a
hair
's
breadth
of
his
shock
of
hair
as
it
stooped
over
the
table
;
but
she
restrained
her
fingers
,
and
said
,
in
a
voice
that
choked
with
its
efforts
to
be
coaxing
:
  
<EOS>
"
Robby
,
my
child
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Misses
Brown
,
"
returned
the
Grinder
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
I
wonder
Master
did
n't
take
you
with
him
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
you
,
Misses
Brown
,
"
returned
the
Grinder
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Brown
instantly
directed
the
clutch
of
her
right
hand
at
his
hair
,
and
the
clutch
of
her
left
hand
at
his
throat
,
and
held
on
to
the
object
of
her
fond
affection
with
such
extraordinary
fury
,
that
his
face
began
to
blacken
in
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Misses
Brown
!
"
exclaimed
the
Grinder
,
"
let
go
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
What
are
you
doing
of
?
<EOS>
Help
,
young
woman
!
<EOS>
Misses
Brow
---
Brow
---
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
young
woman
,
however
,
equally
unmoved
by
his
direct
appeal
to
her
,
and
by
his
inarticulate
utterance
,
remained
quite
neutral
,
until
,
after
struggling
with
his
assailant
into
a
corner
,
Rob
disengaged
himself
,
and
stood
there
panting
and
fenced
in
by
his
own
elbows
,
while
the
old
woman
,
panting
too
,
and
stamping
with
rage
and
eagerness
,
appeared
to
be
collecting
her
energies
for
another
swoop
upon
him
.
<EOS>
At
this
crisis
Alice
interposed
her
voice
,
but
not
in
the
Grinder
's
favour
,
by
saying
,
  
"
Well
done
,
mother
.
<EOS>
Tear
him
to
pieces
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
young
woman
!
"
<EOS>
blubbered
Rob
;
"
are
you
against
me
too
?
<EOS>
What
have
I
been
and
done
?
<EOS>
What
am
I
to
be
tore
to
pieces
for
,
I
should
like
to
know
?
<EOS>
Why
do
you
take
and
choke
a
cove
who
has
never
done
you
any
harm
,
neither
of
you
?
<EOS>
Call
yourselves
females
,
too
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
frightened
and
afflicted
Grinder
,
with
his
coat
-
cuff
at
his
eye
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
surprised
at
you
!
<EOS>
Where
's
your
feminine
tenderness
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
thankless
dog
!
<EOS>
"
gasped
Mrs
Brown
.
<EOS>
"
You
impudent
insulting
dog
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
been
and
done
to
go
and
give
you
offence
,
Misses
Brown
?
"
<EOS>
retorted
the
fearful
Rob
.
<EOS>
"
You
was
very
much
attached
to
me
a
minute
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
cut
me
off
with
his
short
answers
and
his
sulky
words
,
"
said
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Me
!
<EOS>
Because
I
happen
to
be
curious
to
have
a
little
bit
of
gossip
about
Master
and
the
lady
,
to
dare
to
play
at
fast
and
loose
with
me
!
<EOS>
But
I
'll
talk
to
you
no
more
,
my
lad
.
<EOS>
Now
go
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
,
Misses
Brown
,
"
returned
the
abject
Grinder
,
"
<EOS>
I
never
insiniwated
that
I
wished
to
go
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
talk
like
that
,
Misses
Brown
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
talk
at
all
,
"
said
Mrs
Brown
,
with
an
action
of
her
crooked
fingers
that
made
him
shrink
into
half
his
natural
compass
in
the
corner
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
another
word
with
him
shall
pass
my
lips
.
<EOS>
He
's
an
ungrateful
hound
.
<EOS>
I
cast
him
off
.
<EOS>
Now
let
him
go
!
<EOS>
And
I
'll
slip
those
after
him
that
shall
talk
too
much
;
that
wo
n't
be
shook
away
;
that
'll
hang
to
him
like
leeches
,
and
slink
arter
him
like
foxes
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
He
knows
'em
.
<EOS>
He
knows
his
old
games
and
his
old
ways
.
<EOS>
If
he
's
forgotten
'em
,
they
'll
soon
remind
him
.
<EOS>
Now
let
him
go
,
and
see
how
he
'll
do
Master
's
business
,
and
keep
Master
's
secrets
,
with
such
company
always
following
him
up
and
down
.
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha!He'll
find
'em
a
different
sort
from
you
and
me
,
Ally
;
close
as
he
is
with
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
Now
let
him
go
,
now
let
him
go
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
,
to
the
unspeakable
dismay
of
the
Grinder
,
walked
her
twisted
figure
round
and
round
,
in
a
ring
of
some
four
feet
in
diameter
,
constantly
repeating
these
words
,
and
shaking
her
fist
above
her
head
,
and
working
her
mouth
about
.
  
<EOS>
"
Misses
Brown
,
"
pleaded
Rob
,
coming
a
little
out
of
his
corner
,
"
I
'm
sure
you
would
n't
injure
a
cove
,
on
second
thoughts
,
and
in
cold
blood
,
would
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
to
me
,
"
said
Mrs
Brown
,
still
wrathfully
pursuing
her
circle
.
<EOS>
"
Now
let
him
go
,
now
let
him
go
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Misses
Brown
,
"
urged
the
tormented
Grinder
,
"
I
did
n't
mean
to
---
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
a
thing
it
is
for
a
cove
to
get
into
such
a
line
as
this
!
<EOS>
---
I
was
only
careful
of
talking
,
Misses
Brown
,
because
I
always
am
,
on
account
of
his
being
up
to
everything
;
but
I
might
have
known
it
would
n't
have
gone
any
further
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
'm
quite
agreeable
,
"
with
a
wretched
face
,
"
for
any
little
bit
of
gossip
,
Misses
Brown
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
go
on
like
this
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
could
n't
you
have
the
goodness
to
put
in
a
word
for
a
miserable
cove
,
here
?
"
said
the
Grinder
,
appealing
in
desperation
to
the
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
mother
<EOS>
,
you
hear
what
he
says
,
"
she
interposed
,
in
her
stern
voice
,
and
with
an
impatient
action
of
her
head
;
"
try
him
once
more
,
and
if
you
fall
out
with
him
again
,
ruin
him
,
if
you
like
,
and
have
done
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Brown
,
moved
as
it
seemed
by
this
very
tender
exhortation
,
presently
began
to
howl
;
and
softening
by
degrees
,
took
the
apologetic
Grinder
to
her
arms
,
who
embraced
her
with
a
face
of
unutterable
woe
,
and
like
a
victim
as
he
was
,
resumed
his
former
seat
,
close
by
the
side
of
his
venerable
friend
,
whom
he
suffered
,
not
without
much
constrained
sweetness
of
countenance
,
combating
very
expressive
physiognomical
revelations
of
an
opposite
character
,
to
draw
his
arm
through
hers
,
and
keep
it
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
's
Master
<EOS>
,
deary
dear
?
"
said
Mrs
Brown
,
when
,
sitting
in
this
amicable
posture
,
they
had
pledged
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
If
you
'd
be
so
good
,
Misses
Brown
,
as
to
speak
a
little
lower
,
"
Rob
implored
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
he
's
pretty
well
,
thank'ee
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
out
of
place
,
Robby
?
"
said
Mrs
Brown
in
a
wheedling
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
'm
not
exactly
out
of
place
,
nor
in
,
"
faltered
Rob
.
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
'm
still
in
pay
,
Misses
Brown
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
nothing
to
do
,
Rob
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
particular
to
do
just
now
,
Misses
Brown
,
but
to
---
keep
my
eyes
open
,
"
said
the
Grinder
,
rolling
them
in
a
forlorn
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Masters
abroad
,
Rob
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
for
goodness
'
sake
,
Misses
Brown
,
could
n't
you
gossip
with
a
cove
about
anything
else
?
"
cried
the
Grinder
,
in
a
burst
of
despair
.
  
<EOS>
The
impetuous
Mrs
Brown
rising
directly
,
the
tortured
Grinder
detained
her
,
stammering
"
Ye
-
es
,
Misses
Brown
<EOS>
,
I
believe
he
's
abroad
.
<EOS>
What
's
she
staring
at
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
in
allusion
to
the
daughter
,
whose
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
face
that
now
again
looked
out
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mind
her
,
lad
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
holding
him
closer
to
prevent
his
turning
round
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
her
way
---
her
way
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
Rob
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
the
lady
,
deary
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Misses
Brown
,
what
lady
?
"
cried
the
Grinder
in
a
tone
of
piteous
supplication
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
lady
?
<EOS>
"
she
retorted
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
lady
;
Mrs
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
believe
I
see
her
once
,
"
replied
Rob
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
night
she
went
away
,
Robby
,
eh
?
"
said
the
old
woman
in
his
ear
,
and
taking
note
of
every
change
in
his
face
.
"
<EOS>
Aha!I
know
it
was
that
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
you
know
it
was
that
night
,
you
know
,
Misses
Brown
,
"
replied
Rob
,
"
it
's
no
use
putting
pinchers
into
a
cove
to
make
him
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
did
they
go
that
night
,
Rob
?
<EOS>
Straight
away
?
<EOS>
How
did
they
go
?
<EOS>
Where
did
you
see
her
?
<EOS>
Did
she
laugh
?
<EOS>
Did
she
cry
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
all
about
it
,
"
cried
the
old
hag
,
holding
him
closer
yet
,
patting
the
hand
that
was
drawn
through
his
arm
against
her
other
hand
,
and
searching
every
line
in
his
face
with
her
bleared
eyes
.
"
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
Begin
!
<EOS>
I
want
to
be
told
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
What
,
Rob
,
boy
!
<EOS>
You
and
me
can
keep
a
secret
together
,
eh
?
<EOS>
We
've
done
so
before
now
.
<EOS>
Where
did
they
go
first
,
Rob
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
wretched
Grinder
made
a
gasp
,
and
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
dumb
?
"
said
the
old
woman
,
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
,
Misses
Brown
,
no
!
<EOS>
You
expect
a
cove
to
be
a
flash
of
lightning
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
was
the
electric
fluency
,
"
muttered
the
bewildered
Grinder
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
have
a
shock
at
somebody
,
that
would
settle
their
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
old
woman
,
with
a
grin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
wishing
my
love
to
you
,
Misses
Brown
,
"
returned
the
false
Rob
,
seeking
consolation
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
"
Where
did
they
go
to
first
,
was
it
?
<EOS>
Him
and
her
,
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
!
"
said
the
old
woman
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Them
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
they
did
n't
go
nowhere
---
not
together
,
I
mean
,
"
answered
Rob
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
looked
at
him
,
as
though
she
had
a
strong
impulse
upon
her
to
make
another
clutch
at
his
head
and
throat
,
but
was
restrained
by
a
certain
dogged
mystery
in
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
the
art
of
it
,
"
said
the
reluctant
Grinder
;
"
that
's
the
way
nobody
saw
'em
go
,
or
has
been
able
to
say
how
they
did
go
.
<EOS>
They
went
different
ways
,
I
tell
you
,
Misses
Brown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
ay
!
<EOS>
To
meet
at
an
appointed
place
,
"
chuckled
the
old
woman
,
after
a
moment
's
silent
and
keen
scrutiny
of
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
if
they
were
n't
a
going
to
meet
somewhere
,
I
suppose
they
might
as
well
have
stayed
at
home
,
might
n't
they
,
Misses
Brown
?
"
returned
the
unwilling
Grinder
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Rob
?
<EOS>
Well
?
"
said
the
old
woman
,
drawing
his
arm
yet
tighter
through
her
own
,
as
if
,
in
her
eagerness
,
she
were
afraid
of
his
slipping
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
have
n't
we
talked
enough
yet
,
Misses
Brown
?
"
<EOS>
returned
the
Grinder
,
who
,
between
his
sense
of
injury
,
his
sense
of
liquor
,
and
his
sense
of
being
on
the
rack
,
had
become
so
lachrymose
,
that
at
almost
every
answer
he
scooped
his
coat
-
cuff
into
one
or
other
of
his
eyes
,
and
uttered
an
unavailing
whine
of
remonstrance
.
<EOS>
"
Did
she
laugh
that
night
,
was
it
?
<EOS>
Did
n't
you
ask
if
she
laughed
,
Misses
Brown
?
"
  
"
Or
cried
?
<EOS>
"
added
the
old
woman
,
nodding
assent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Neither
,
"
said
the
Grinder
.
<EOS>
"
She
kept
as
steady
when
she
and
me
---
<EOS>
oh
,
I
see
you
will
have
it
out
of
me
,
<EOS>
Misses
Brown!But
take
your
solemn
oath
now
,
that
you
'll
never
tell
anybody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
Mrs
Brown
very
readily
did
:
being
naturally
Jesuitical
;
and
having
no
other
intention
in
the
matter
than
that
her
concealed
visitor
should
hear
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
kept
as
steady
,
then
,
when
she
and
me
went
down
to
Southampton
,
"
said
the
Grinder
,
"
as
a
image
.
<EOS>
In
the
morning
she
was
just
the
same
,
Misses
Brown
.
<EOS>
And
when
she
went
away
in
the
packet
before
daylight
,
by
herself
---
me
pretending
to
be
her
servant
,
and
seeing
her
safe
aboard
---
she
was
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
Now
,
are
you
contented
,
Misses
Brown
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Rob
.
<EOS>
Not
yet
,
"
answered
Mrs
Brown
,
decisively
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
here
's
a
woman
for
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
unfortunate
Rob
,
in
an
outburst
of
feeble
lamentation
over
his
own
helplessness
.
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
wish
to
know
next
,
Misses
Brown
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
became
of
Master
?
<EOS>
Where
did
he
go
?
<EOS>
"
she
inquired
,
still
holding
him
tight
,
and
looking
close
into
his
face
,
with
her
sharp
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
soul
,
I
do
n't
know
,
Misses
Brown
,
"
answered
Rob
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
soul
I
do
n't
know
what
he
did
,
nor
where
he
went
,
nor
anything
about
him
.
<EOS>
I
only
know
what
he
said
to
me
as
a
caution
to
hold
my
tongue
,
when
we
parted
;
and
I
tell
you
this
,
Misses
Brown
,
as
a
friend
,
that
sooner
than
ever
repeat
a
word
of
what
we
're
saying
now
,
you
had
better
take
and
shoot
yourself
,
or
shut
yourself
up
in
this
house
,
and
set
it
a
-
fire
,
for
there
's
nothing
he
would
n't
do
,
to
be
revenged
upon
you
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
him
half
as
well
as
I
do
,
Misses
Brown
.
<EOS>
You
're
never
safe
from
him
,
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
n't
I
taken
an
oath
,
"
retorted
the
old
woman
,
"
and
wo
n't
I
keep
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'm
sure
I
hope
you
will
,
Misses
Brown
.
"
returned
Rob
,
somewhat
doubtfully
,
and
not
without
a
latent
threatening
in
his
manner
.
<EOS>
"
For
your
own
sake
quite
as
much
as
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
as
he
gave
her
this
friendly
caution
,
and
emphasized
it
with
a
nodding
of
his
head
;
but
finding
it
uncomfortable
to
encounter
the
yellow
face
with
its
grotesque
action
,
and
the
ferret
eyes
with
their
keen
old
wintry
gaze
,
so
close
to
his
own
,
he
looked
down
uneasily
and
sat
shuffling
in
his
chair
,
as
if
he
were
trying
to
bring
himself
to
a
sullen
declaration
that
he
would
answer
no
more
questions
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
,
still
holding
him
as
before
,
took
this
opportunity
of
raising
the
forefinger
of
her
right
hand
,
in
the
air
,
as
a
stealthy
signal
to
the
concealed
observer
to
give
particular
attention
to
what
was
about
to
follow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rob
,
"
she
said
,
in
her
most
coaxing
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
,
Misses
Brown
<EOS>
,
what
's
the
matter
now
?
"
returned
the
exasperated
Grinder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rob
!
<EOS>
where
did
the
lady
and
Master
appoint
to
meet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Rob
shuffled
more
and
more
,
and
looked
up
and
looked
down
,
and
bit
his
thumb
,
and
dried
it
on
his
waistcoat
,
and
finally
said
,
eyeing
his
tormentor
askant
,
"
How
should
I
know
,
Misses
Brown
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
held
up
her
finger
again
,
as
before
,
and
replying
,
"
Come
,
lad
!
<EOS>
It
's
no
use
leading
me
to
that
,
and
there
leaving
me
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
"
---
waited
for
his
answer
.
  
<EOS>
Rob
,
after
a
discomfited
pause
,
suddenly
broke
out
with
,
"
How
can
I
pronounce
the
names
of
foreign
places
,
Mrs
Brown
?
<EOS>
What
an
unreasonable
woman
you
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
heard
it
said
,
Robby
,
"
she
retorted
firmly
,
"
and
you
know
what
it
sounded
like
.
<EOS>
Come
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
it
said
,
Misses
Brown
,
"
returned
the
Grinder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
retorted
the
old
woman
quickly
,
"
you
have
seen
it
written
,
and
you
can
spell
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rob
,
with
a
petulant
exclamation
between
laughing
and
crying
---
for
he
was
penetrated
with
some
admiration
of
Mrs
Brown
's
cunning
,
even
through
this
persecution
---
after
some
reluctant
fumbling
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
produced
from
it
a
little
piece
of
chalk
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
's
eyes
sparkled
when
she
saw
it
between
his
thumb
and
finger
,
and
hastily
clearing
a
space
on
the
deal
table
,
that
he
might
write
the
word
there
,
she
once
more
made
her
signal
with
a
shaking
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
I
tell
you
beforehand
what
it
is
,
Misses
Brown
,
"
said
Rob
,
<EOS>
"
it
's
no
use
asking
me
anything
else
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
answer
anything
else
;
I
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
How
long
it
was
to
be
before
they
met
,
or
whose
plan
it
was
that
they
was
to
go
away
alone
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
no
more
than
you
do
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
any
more
about
it
.
<EOS>
If
I
was
to
tell
you
how
I
found
out
this
word
,
you
'd
believe
that
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you
,
Misses
Brown
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Rob
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
Misses
Brown
.
<EOS>
The
way
---
now
you
wo
n't
ask
any
more
,
you
know
?
"
said
rob
,
turning
his
eyes
,
which
were
now
fast
getting
drowsy
and
stupid
,
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
another
word
,
"
said
Mrs
Brown
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
the
way
was
this
.
<EOS>
When
a
certain
person
left
the
lady
with
me
,
he
put
a
piece
of
paper
with
a
direction
written
on
it
in
the
lady
's
hand
,
saying
it
was
in
case
she
should
forget
.
<EOS>
She
was
n't
afraid
of
forgetting
,
for
she
tore
it
up
as
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
,
and
when
I
put
up
the
carriage
steps
,
I
shook
out
one
of
the
pieces
<EOS>
---
she
sprinkled
the
rest
out
of
the
window
,
I
suppose
,
for
there
was
none
there
afterwards
,
though
I
looked
for
'em
.
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
word
on
it
,
and
that
was
this
,
if
you
must
and
will
know
.
<EOS>
But
remember!You're
upon
your
oath
,
Misses
Brown
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Brown
knew
that
,
she
said
.
<EOS>
Rob
,
having
nothing
more
to
say
,
began
to
chalk
,
slowly
and
laboriously
,
on
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
D
,
"
<EOS>
"
the
old
woman
read
aloud
,
when
he
had
formed
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
hold
your
tongue
,
Misses
Brown
?
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
covering
it
with
his
hand
,
and
turning
impatiently
upon
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
have
it
read
out
.
<EOS>
Be
quiet
,
will
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
write
large
,
Rob
,
"
she
returned
,
repeating
her
secret
signal
;
"
for
my
eyes
are
not
good
,
even
at
print
.
"
  
<EOS>
Muttering
to
himself
,
and
returning
to
his
work
with
an
ill
will
,
Rob
went
on
with
the
word
.
<EOS>
As
he
bent
his
head
down
,
the
person
for
whose
information
he
so
unconsciously
laboured
,
moved
from
the
door
behind
him
to
within
a
short
stride
of
his
shoulder
,
and
looked
eagerly
towards
the
creeping
track
of
his
hand
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
Alice
,
from
her
opposite
chair
,
watched
it
narrowly
as
it
shaped
the
letters
,
and
repeated
each
one
on
her
lips
as
he
made
it
,
without
articulating
it
aloud
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
every
letter
her
eyes
and
Mr
Dombey
's
met
,
as
if
each
of
them
sought
to
be
confirmed
by
the
other
;
and
thus
they
both
spelt
D*I*J*O*N.
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
the
Grinder
,
moistening
the
palm
of
his
hand
hastily
,
to
obliterate
the
word
;
and
not
content
with
smearing
it
out
,
rubbing
and
planing
all
trace
of
it
away
with
his
coat
-
sleeve
,
until
the
very
colour
of
the
chalk
was
gone
from
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
I
hope
you
're
contented
,
Misses
Brown
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
,
in
token
of
her
being
so
,
released
his
arm
and
patted
his
back
;
and
the
Grinder
,
overcome
with
mortification
,
cross
-
examination
,
and
liquor
,
folded
his
arms
on
the
table
,
laid
his
head
upon
them
,
and
fell
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
Not
until
he
had
been
heavily
asleep
some
time
,
and
was
snoring
roundly
,
did
the
old
woman
turn
towards
the
door
,
where
Mr
Dombey
stood
concealed
,
and
beckon
him
to
come
through
the
room
,
and
pass
out
.
<EOS>
Even
then
,
she
hovered
over
Rob
,
ready
to
blind
him
with
her
hands
,
or
strike
his
head
down
,
if
he
should
raise
it
while
the
secret
step
was
crossing
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
But
though
her
glance
took
sharp
cognizance
of
the
sleeper
,
it
was
sharp
too
for
the
waking
man
;
and
when
he
touched
her
hand
with
his
,
and
in
spite
of
all
his
caution
,
made
a
chinking
,
golden
sound
,
it
was
as
bright
and
greedy
as
a
raven
's
.
  
<EOS>
The
daughter
's
dark
gaze
followed
him
to
the
door
,
and
noted
well
how
pale
he
was
,
and
how
his
hurried
tread
indicated
that
the
least
delay
was
an
insupportable
restraint
upon
him
,
and
how
he
was
burning
to
be
active
and
away
.
<EOS>
As
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
,
she
looked
round
at
her
mother
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
trotted
to
her
;
opened
her
hand
to
show
what
was
within
;
and
,
tightly
closing
it
again
in
her
jealousy
and
avarice
,
whispered
:
  
"
<EOS>
What
will
he
do
,
Ally
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mischief
,
"
said
the
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Murder
?
"
asked
the
old
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
madman
,
in
his
wounded
pride
,
and
may
do
that
,
for
anything
we
can
say
,
or
he
either
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
glance
was
brighter
than
her
mother
's
,
and
the
fire
that
shone
in
it
was
fiercer
;
but
her
face
was
colourless
,
even
to
her
lips
.
  
<EOS>
They
said
no
more
,
but
sat
apart
;
the
mother
communing
with
her
money
;
the
daughter
with
her
thoughts
;
the
glance
of
each
,
shining
in
the
gloom
of
the
feebly
lighted
room
.
<EOS>
Rob
slept
and
snored
.
<EOS>
The
disregarded
parrot
only
was
in
action
.
<EOS>
It
twisted
and
pulled
at
the
wires
of
its
cage
,
with
its
crooked
beak
,
and
crawled
up
to
the
dome
,
and
along
its
roof
like
a
fly
,
and
down
again
head
foremost
,
and
shook
,
and
bit
,
and
rattled
at
every
slender
bar
,
as
if
it
knew
its
master
's
danger
,
and
was
wild
to
force
a
passage
out
,
and
fly
away
to
warn
him
of
it
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
53
.
<EOS>
More
Intelligence
 
<EOS>
THERE
were
two
of
the
traitor
's
own
blood
---
his
renounced
brother
and
sister
---
on
whom
the
weight
of
his
guilt
rested
almost
more
heavily
,
at
this
time
,
than
on
the
man
whom
he
had
so
deeply
injured
.
<EOS>
Prying
and
tormenting
as
the
world
was
,
it
did
Mr
Dombey
the
service
of
nerving
him
to
pursuit
and
revenge
.
<EOS>
It
roused
his
passion
,
stung
his
pride
,
twisted
the
one
idea
of
his
life
into
a
new
shape
,
and
made
some
gratification
of
his
wrath
,
the
object
into
which
his
whole
intellectual
existence
resolved
itself
.
<EOS>
All
the
stubbornness
and
implacability
of
his
nature
,
all
its
hard
impenetrable
quality
,
all
its
gloom
and
moroseness
,
all
its
exaggerated
sense
of
personal
importance
,
all
its
jealous
disposition
to
resent
the
least
flaw
in
the
ample
recognition
of
his
importance
by
others
,
set
this
way
like
many
streams
united
into
one
,
and
bore
him
on
upon
their
tide
.
<EOS>
The
most
impetuously
passionate
and
violently
impulsive
of
mankind
would
have
been
a
milder
enemy
to
encounter
than
the
sullen
Mr
Dombey
wrought
to
this
.
<EOS>
A
wild
beast
would
have
been
easier
turned
or
soothed
than
the
grave
gentleman
without
a
wrinkle
in
his
starched
cravat
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
very
intensity
of
his
purpose
became
almost
a
substitute
for
action
in
it
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
yet
uninformed
of
the
traitor
's
retreat
,
it
served
to
divert
his
mind
from
his
own
calamity
,
and
to
entertain
it
with
another
prospect
.
<EOS>
The
brother
and
sister
of
his
false
favourite
had
no
such
relief
;
everything
in
their
history
,
past
and
present
,
gave
his
delinquency
a
more
afflicting
meaning
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
sister
may
have
sometimes
sadly
thought
that
if
she
had
remained
with
him
,
the
companion
and
friend
she
had
been
once
,
he
might
have
escaped
the
crime
into
which
he
had
fallen
.
<EOS>
If
she
ever
thought
so
,
it
was
still
without
regret
for
what
she
had
done
,
without
the
least
doubt
of
her
duty
,
without
any
pricing
and
enhancing
of
her
self
-
devotion
.
<EOS>
But
when
this
possibility
presented
itself
to
the
erring
and
repentant
brother
,
as
it
sometimes
did
,
it
smote
upon
his
heart
with
such
a
keen
,
reproachful
touch
as
he
could
hardly
bear
.
<EOS>
No
idea
of
retort
upon
his
cruel
brother
came
into
his
mind
.
<EOS>
New
accusation
of
himself
,
fresh
inward
lamentings
over
his
own
unworthiness
,
and
the
ruin
in
which
it
was
at
once
his
consolation
and
his
self
-
reproach
that
he
did
not
stand
alone
,
were
the
sole
kind
of
reflections
to
which
the
discovery
gave
rise
in
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
very
same
day
whose
evening
set
upon
the
last
chapter
,
and
when
Mr
Dombey
's
world
was
busiest
with
the
elopement
of
his
wife
,
that
the
window
of
the
room
in
which
the
brother
and
sister
sat
at
their
early
breakfast
,
was
darkened
by
the
unexpected
shadow
of
a
man
coming
to
the
little
porch
:
which
man
was
Perch
the
Messenger
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
stepped
over
from
Balls
Pond
at
a
early
hour
,
"
said
Mr
Perch
,
confidentially
looking
in
at
the
room
door
,
and
stopping
on
the
mat
to
wipe
his
shoes
all
round
,
which
had
no
mud
upon
them
,
"
agreeable
to
my
instructions
last
night
.
<EOS>
They
was
,
to
be
sure
and
bring
a
note
to
you
,
Mr
Carker
,
before
you
went
out
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
here
a
good
hour
and
a
half
ago
,
"
said
Mr
Perch
,
meekly
,
"
but
for
the
state
of
health
<EOS>
Mrs
P
,
who
I
thought
I
should
have
lost
in
the
night
<EOS>
,
I
do
assure
you
,
five
distinct
times
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
your
wife
so
ill
?
"
asked
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
see
,
"
said
Mr
Perch
,
first
turning
round
to
shut
the
door
carefully
,
"
she
takes
what
has
happened
in
our
House
so
much
to
heart
,
<EOS>
Miss.
Her
nerves
is
so
very
delicate
,
you
see
,
and
soon
unstrung
.
<EOS>
Not
but
what
the
strongest
nerves
had
good
need
to
be
shook
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
You
feel
it
very
much
yourself
,
no
doubts
.
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
repressed
a
sigh
,
and
glanced
at
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
feel
it
myself
,
in
my
humble
way
,
"
Mr
Perch
went
on
to
say
,
with
a
shake
of
his
head
,
"
<EOS>
in
a
manner
I
could
n't
have
believed
if
I
had
n't
been
called
upon
to
undergo
.
<EOS>
It
has
almost
the
effect
of
drink
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
literally
feels
every
morning
as
if
I
had
been
taking
more
than
was
good
for
me
over
-
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Perch
's
appearance
corroborated
this
recital
of
his
symptoms
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
air
of
feverish
lassitude
about
it
,
that
seemed
referable
to
drams
;
and
,
which
,
in
fact
,
might
no
doubt
have
been
traced
to
those
numerous
discoveries
of
himself
in
the
bars
of
public
-
houses
,
being
treated
and
questioned
,
which
he
was
in
the
daily
habit
of
making
.
  
<EOS>
"
Therefore
I
can
judge
,
"
said
Mr
Perch
,
shaking
his
head
again
,
and
speaking
in
a
silvery
murmur
,
"
of
the
feelings
of
such
as
<EOS>
is
at
all
peculiarly
sitiwated
in
this
most
painful
rewelation
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Perch
waited
to
be
confided
in
;
and
receiving
no
confidence
,
coughed
behind
his
hand
.
<EOS>
This
leading
to
nothing
,
he
coughed
behind
his
hat
;
and
that
leading
to
nothing
,
he
put
his
hat
on
the
ground
and
sought
in
his
breast
pocket
for
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
rightly
recollect
,
there
was
no
answer
,
"
said
Mr
Perch
,
with
an
affable
smile
;
"
but
perhaps
you
'll
be
so
good
as
cast
your
eye
over
it
,
Sir
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
John
Carker
broke
the
seal
,
which
was
Mr
Dombey
's
,
and
possessing
himself
of
the
contents
,
which
were
very
brief
,
replied
,
"
No
.
<EOS>
No
answer
is
expected
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
shall
wish
you
good
morning
,
Miss
,
"
said
Perch
,
taking
a
step
toward
the
door
,
"
and
hoping
,
I
'm
sure
,
that
you
'll
not
permit
yourself
to
be
more
reduced
in
mind
than
you
can
help
,
by
the
late
painful
rewelation
.
<EOS>
The
Papers
,
"
said
Mr
Perch
,
taking
two
steps
back
again
,
and
comprehensively
addressing
both
the
brother
and
sister
in
a
whisper
of
increased
mystery
,
"
is
more
eager
for
news
of
it
than
you
'd
suppose
possible
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
Sunday
ones
,
in
a
blue
cloak
and
a
white
hat
,
that
had
previously
offered
for
to
bribe
me
---
need
I
say
with
what
success
?
---
was
dodging
about
our
court
last
night
as
late
as
twenty
minutes
after
eight
o'clock
.
<EOS>
I
see
him
myself
,
with
his
eye
at
the
counting
-
house
keyhole
,
which
being
patent
is
impervious
.
<EOS>
Another
one
,
"
said
Mr
Perch
,
"
with
milintary
frogs
,
is
in
the
parlour
of
the
King
's
Arms
all
the
blessed
day
.
<EOS>
I
happened
,
last
week
,
to
let
a
little
obserwation
fall
there
,
and
next
morning
,
which
was
Sunday
,
I
see
it
worked
up
in
print
,
in
a
most
surprising
manner
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Perch
resorted
to
his
breast
pocket
,
as
if
to
produce
the
paragraph
,
but
receiving
no
encouragement
,
pulled
out
his
beaver
gloves
,
picked
up
his
hat
,
and
took
his
leave
;
and
before
it
was
high
noon
,
Mr
Perch
had
related
to
several
select
audiences
at
the
King
's
Arms
and
elsewhere
<EOS>
,
how
Miss
Carker
,
bursting
into
tears
,
had
caught
him
by
both
hands
,
and
said
,
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
dear
Perch
,
the
sight
of
you
is
all
the
comfort
I
have
"
left
!
"
<EOS>
and
how
Mr
John
Carker
and
said
,
in
an
awful
voice
,
"
Perch
,
I
disown
him
.
<EOS>
Never
let
me
hear
him
mentioned
as
a
brother
more
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
John
,
"
said
Harriet
,
when
they
were
left
alone
,
and
had
remained
silent
for
some
few
moments
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
bad
tidings
in
that
letter
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
unexpected
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
saw
the
writer
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
writer
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
He
passed
twice
through
the
counting
-
house
while
I
was
there
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
able
to
avoid
him
before
,
but
of
course
could
not
hope
to
do
that
long
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
natural
it
was
that
he
should
regard
my
presence
as
something
offensive
;
I
felt
it
must
be
so
,
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
not
say
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
he
said
nothing
:
<EOS>
but
I
saw
that
his
glance
rested
on
me
for
a
moment
,
and
I
was
prepared
for
what
would
happen
---
for
what
has
happened
.
<EOS>
I
am
dismissed
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
as
little
shocked
and
as
hopeful
as
she
could
,
but
it
was
distressing
news
,
for
many
reasons
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
need
not
tell
you
,
"
"
said
John
Carker
,
reading
the
letter
,
"
"
why
your
name
would
henceforth
have
an
unnatural
sound
,
in
however
remote
a
connexion
with
mine
,
or
why
the
daily
sight
of
any
one
who
bears
it
,
would
be
unendurable
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
notify
the
cessation
of
all
engagements
between
us
,
from
this
date
,
and
to
request
that
no
renewal
of
any
communication
with
me
,
or
my
establishment
,
be
ever
attempted
by
you
.
"
<EOS>
---
Enclosed
is
an
equivalent
in
money
to
a
generously
long
notice
,
and
this
is
my
discharge
.
<EOS>
Heaven
knows
,
Harriet
,
it
is
a
lenient
and
considerate
one
,
when
we
remember
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
be
lenient
and
considerate
to
punish
you
at
all
,
John
,
for
the
misdeed
of
another
,
"
she
replied
gently
,
"
yes
'
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
an
ill
-
omened
race
to
him
,
"
said
John
Carker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
reason
to
shrink
from
the
sound
of
our
name
,
and
to
think
that
there
is
something
cursed
and
wicked
in
our
blood
.
<EOS>
I
should
almost
think
it
too
,
Harriet
,
but
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Brother
,
do
n't
speak
like
this
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
special
reason
,
as
you
say
you
have
,
and
think
you
have
---
though
I
say
,
No
!
---
to
love
me
,
spare
me
the
hearing
of
such
wild
mad
words
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
covered
his
face
with
both
his
hands
;
but
soon
permitted
her
,
coming
near
him
,
to
take
one
in
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
so
many
years
,
this
parting
is
a
melancholy
thing
,
I
know
,
"
said
his
sister
,
"
and
the
cause
of
it
is
dreadful
to
us
both
.
<EOS>
We
have
to
live
,
too
,
and
must
look
about
us
for
the
means
.
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
<EOS>
We
can
do
so
,
undismayed
.
<EOS>
It
is
our
pride
,
not
our
trouble
,
to
strive
,
John
,
and
to
strive
together
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
smile
played
on
her
lips
,
as
she
kissed
his
cheek
,
and
entreated
him
to
be
of
good
cheer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dearest
sister
!
<EOS>
Tied
,
of
your
own
noble
will
,
to
a
ruined
man
!
<EOS>
whose
reputation
is
blighted
;
who
has
no
friend
himself
,
and
has
driven
every
friend
of
yours
away
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
John
!
"
<EOS>
she
laid
her
hand
hastily
upon
his
lips
,
"
for
my
sake!In
remembrance
of
our
long
companionship
!
"
<EOS>
He
was
silent
.
"
<EOS>
Now
let
me
tell
you
,
dear
,
"
quietly
sitting
by
his
side
,
"
I
have
,
as
you
have
,
expected
this
;
and
when
I
have
been
thinking
of
it
,
and
fearing
that
it
would
happen
,
and
preparing
myself
for
it
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
I
have
resolved
to
tell
you
,
if
it
should
be
so
,
that
I
have
kept
a
secret
from
you
,
and
that
we
have
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
our
friend
's
name
,
Harriet
?
"
<EOS>
he
answered
with
a
sorrowful
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
I
do
n't
know
,
but
he
once
made
a
very
earnest
protestation
to
me
of
his
friendship
and
his
wish
to
serve
us
:
and
to
this
day
I
believe
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Harriet
!
"
exclaimed
her
wondering
brother
,
"
where
does
this
friend
live
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Neither
do
I
know
that
,
"
she
returned
.
"
<EOS>
But
he
knows
us
both
,
and
our
history
---
all
our
little
history
,
John
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
reason
why
,
at
his
own
suggestion
,
I
have
kept
the
secret
of
his
coming
here
,
from
you
,
lest
his
acquaintance
with
it
should
distress
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
!
<EOS>
Has
he
been
here
,
Harriet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
in
this
room
.
<EOS>
Once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
kind
of
man
?
"
  
"
Not
young
.
"
<EOS>
Grey
-
headed
,
"
as
he
said
,
"
and
fast
growing
greyer
.
"
<EOS>
But
generous
,
and
frank
,
and
good
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
only
seen
once
,
Harriet
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
this
room
only
once
,
"
said
his
sister
,
with
the
slightest
and
most
transient
glow
upon
her
cheek
;
"
but
when
here
,
he
entreated
me
to
suffer
him
to
see
me
once
a
week
as
he
passed
by
,
in
token
of
our
being
well
,
and
continuing
to
need
nothing
at
his
hands
.
<EOS>
For
I
told
him
,
when
he
proffered
us
any
service
he
could
render
---
which
was
the
object
of
his
visit
---
that
we
needed
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
once
a
week
"
  
"
Once
every
week
since
then
,
and
always
on
the
same
day
,
and
at
the
same
hour
,
he
has
gone
past
;
always
on
foot
;
always
going
in
the
same
direction
---
towards
London
;
and
never
pausing
longer
than
to
bow
to
me
,
and
wave
his
hand
cheerfully
,
as
a
kind
guardian
might
.
<EOS>
He
made
that
promise
when
he
proposed
these
curious
interviews
,
and
has
kept
it
so
faithfully
and
pleasantly
,
that
if
I
ever
felt
any
trifling
uneasiness
about
them
in
the
beginning
(
which
I
do
n't
think
I
did
,
John
;
his
manner
was
so
plain
and
true
)
<EOS>
it
very
soon
vanished
,
and
left
me
quite
glad
when
the
day
was
coming
.
<EOS>
Last
Monday
---
the
first
since
this
terrible
event
---
he
did
not
go
by
;
and
I
have
wondered
whether
his
absence
can
have
been
in
any
way
connected
with
what
has
happened
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
inquired
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
speculated
on
the
coincidence
;
I
have
not
tried
to
account
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
he
will
return
.
<EOS>
When
he
does
,
dear
John
,
let
me
tell
him
that
I
have
at
last
spoken
to
you
,
and
let
me
bring
you
together
.
<EOS>
He
will
certainly
help
us
to
a
new
livelihood
.
<EOS>
His
entreaty
was
that
he
might
do
something
to
smooth
my
life
and
yours
;
and
I
gave
him
my
promise
that
if
we
ever
wanted
a
friend
,
I
would
remember
him
.
<EOS>
Then
his
name
was
to
be
no
secret
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Harriet
,
"
said
her
brother
,
who
had
listened
with
close
attention
,
"
describe
his
gentleman
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
surely
ought
to
know
one
who
knows
me
so
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
sister
painted
,
as
vividly
as
she
could
,
the
features
,
stature
,
and
dress
of
her
visitor
;
but
John
Carker
,
either
from
having
no
knowledge
of
the
original
,
or
from
some
fault
in
her
description
,
or
from
some
abstraction
of
his
thoughts
as
he
walked
to
and
fro
,
pondering
,
could
not
recognise
the
portrait
she
presented
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
it
was
agreed
between
them
that
he
should
see
the
original
when
he
next
appeared
.
<EOS>
This
concluded
,
the
sister
applied
herself
,
with
a
less
anxious
breast
,
to
her
domestic
occupations
;
and
the
grey
-
haired
man
,
late
Junior
of
Dombey
's
,
devoted
the
first
day
of
his
unwonted
liberty
to
working
in
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
quite
late
at
night
,
and
the
brother
was
reading
aloud
while
the
sister
plied
her
needle
,
when
they
were
interrupted
by
a
knocking
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
In
the
atmosphere
of
vague
anxiety
and
dread
that
lowered
about
them
in
connexion
with
their
fugitive
brother
,
this
sound
,
unusual
there
,
became
almost
alarming
.
<EOS>
The
brother
going
to
the
door
,
the
sister
sat
and
listened
timidly
.
<EOS>
Some
one
spoke
to
him
,
and
he
replied
and
seemed
surprised
;
and
after
a
few
words
,
the
two
approached
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
Harriet
,
"
said
her
brother
,
lighting
in
their
late
visitor
,
and
speaking
in
a
low
voice
,
"
Mr
Morfin
---
the
gentleman
so
long
in
Dombey
's
House
with
James
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
sister
started
back
,
as
if
a
ghost
had
entered
.
<EOS>
In
the
doorway
stood
the
unknown
friend
,
with
the
dark
hair
sprinkled
with
grey
,
the
ruddy
face
,
the
broad
clear
brow
,
and
hazel
eyes
,
whose
secret
she
had
kept
so
long
!
  
<EOS>
"
John
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
half
-
breathless
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
gentleman
I
told
you
of
,
to
-
day
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
,
Miss
Harriet
,
"
said
the
visitor
,
coming
in
---
for
he
had
stopped
a
moment
in
the
doorway
---
"
is
greatly
relieved
to
hear
you
say
that
:
he
has
been
devising
ways
and
means
,
all
the
way
here
,
of
explaining
himself
,
and
has
been
satisfied
with
none
.
<EOS>
Mr
John
,
I
am
not
quite
a
stranger
here
.
<EOS>
You
were
stricken
with
astonishment
when
you
saw
me
at
your
door
just
now
.
<EOS>
I
observe
you
are
more
astonished
at
present
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
That
's
reasonable
enough
under
existing
circumstances
.
<EOS>
If
we
were
not
such
creatures
of
habit
as
we
are
,
we
should
n't
have
reason
to
be
astonished
half
so
often
.
"
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
he
had
greeted
Harriet
with
that
agreeable
mingling
of
cordiality
and
respect
which
she
recollected
so
well
,
and
had
sat
down
near
her
,
pulled
off
his
gloves
,
and
thrown
them
into
his
hat
upon
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
astonishing
,
"
he
said
,
"
in
my
having
conceived
a
desire
to
see
your
sister
,
Mr
John
,
or
in
my
having
gratified
it
in
my
own
way
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
regularity
of
my
visits
since
(
which
she
may
have
mentioned
to
you
)
,
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
in
that
.
<EOS>
They
soon
grew
into
a
habit
;
and
we
are
creatures
of
habit
---
creatures
of
habit
!
"
  
<EOS>
Putting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
he
looked
at
the
brother
and
sister
as
if
it
were
interesting
to
him
to
see
them
together
;
and
went
on
to
say
,
with
a
king
of
irritable
thoughtfulness
:
"
<EOS>
It
's
this
same
habit
that
confirms
some
of
us
,
who
are
capable
of
better
things
,
in
Lucifer
's
own
pride
and
stubbornness
---
<EOS>
that
confirms
and
deepens
others
of
us
in
villany
---
more
of
us
in
indifference
---
<EOS>
that
hardens
us
from
day
to
day
,
according
to
the
temper
of
our
clay
,
like
images
,
and
leaves
us
as
susceptible
as
images
to
new
impressions
and
convictions
.
<EOS>
You
shall
judge
of
its
influence
on
me
,
John
.
<EOS>
For
more
years
than
I
need
name
,
I
had
my
small
,
and
exactly
defined
share
,
in
the
management
of
Dombey
's
House
,
and
saw
your
brother
(
who
has
proved
himself
a
scoundrel
!
<EOS>
Your
sister
will
forgive
my
being
obliged
to
mention
it
)
extending
and
extending
his
influence
,
until
the
business
and
its
owner
were
his
football
;
and
saw
you
toiling
at
your
obscure
desk
every
day
;
and
was
quite
content
to
be
as
little
troubled
as
I
might
be
,
out
of
my
own
strip
of
duty
,
and
to
let
everything
about
me
go
on
,
day
by
day
,
unquestioned
,
like
a
great
machine
---
that
was
its
habit
and
mine
---
and
to
take
it
all
for
granted
,
and
consider
it
all
right
.
<EOS>
My
Wednesday
nights
came
regularly
round
,
our
quartette
parties
came
regularly
off
,
my
violoncello
was
in
good
tune
,
and
there
was
nothing
wrong
in
my
world
---
or
if
anything
not
much
---
or
little
or
much
,
it
was
no
affair
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
answer
for
your
being
more
respected
and
beloved
during
all
that
time
than
anybody
in
the
House
,
Sir
,
"
said
John
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
<EOS>
Good
-
natured
and
easy
enough
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
a
habit
I
had
.
<EOS>
It
suited
the
Manager
;
it
suited
the
man
he
managed
:
it
suited
me
best
of
all
.
<EOS>
I
did
what
was
allotted
to
me
to
do
,
made
no
court
to
either
of
them
,
and
was
glad
to
occupy
a
station
in
which
none
was
required
.
<EOS>
So
I
should
have
gone
on
till
now
,
but
that
my
room
had
a
thin
wall
.
<EOS>
You
can
tell
your
sister
that
it
was
divided
from
the
Manager
's
room
by
a
wainscot
partition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
were
adjoining
rooms
;
had
been
one
,
perhaps
,
originally
;
and
were
separated
,
as
Mr
Morfin
says
,
"
said
her
brother
,
looking
back
to
him
for
the
resumption
of
his
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
whistled
,
hummed
tunes
,
gone
accurately
through
the
whole
of
Beethoven
's
Sonata
in
B
,
to
let
him
know
that
I
was
within
hearing
,
"
said
Mr
Morfin
;
"
but
he
never
heeded
me
.
<EOS>
It
happened
seldom
enough
that
I
was
within
hearing
of
anything
of
a
private
nature
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
was
,
and
could
n't
otherwise
avoid
knowing
something
of
it
,
I
walked
out
.
<EOS>
I
walked
out
once
,
John
,
during
a
conversation
between
two
brothers
,
to
which
,
in
the
beginning
,
young
Walter
Gay
was
a
party
.
<EOS>
But
I
overheard
some
of
it
before
I
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
You
remember
it
sufficiently
,
perhaps
,
to
tell
your
sister
what
its
nature
was
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
referred
,
Harriet
,
"
said
her
brother
in
a
low
voice
,
"
to
the
past
,
and
to
our
relative
positions
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Its
matter
was
not
new
to
me
,
but
was
presented
in
a
new
aspect
.
<EOS>
It
shook
me
in
my
habit
---
the
habit
of
nine
-
tenths
of
the
world
---
of
believing
that
all
was
right
about
me
,
because
I
was
used
to
it
,
"
said
their
visitor
;
"
and
induced
me
to
recall
the
history
of
the
two
brothers
,
and
to
ponder
on
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
was
almost
the
first
time
in
my
life
when
I
fell
into
this
train
of
reflection
<EOS>
---
how
will
many
things
that
are
familiar
,
and
quite
matters
of
course
to
us
now
,
look
when
we
come
to
see
them
from
that
new
and
distant
point
of
view
which
we
must
all
take
up
,
one
day
or
other
?
<EOS>
I
was
something
less
goodnatured
,
as
the
phrase
goes
,
after
that
morning
,
less
easy
and
complacent
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
sat
for
a
minute
or
so
,
drumming
with
one
hand
on
the
table
;
and
resumed
in
a
hurry
,
as
if
he
were
anxious
to
get
rid
of
his
confession
.
  
<EOS>
"
Before
I
knew
what
to
do
,
or
whether
I
could
do
anything
,
there
was
a
second
conversation
between
the
same
two
brothers
,
in
which
their
sister
was
mentioned
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
scruples
of
conscience
in
suffering
all
the
waifs
and
strays
of
that
conversation
to
float
to
me
as
freely
as
they
would
.
<EOS>
I
considered
them
mine
by
right
.
<EOS>
After
that
,
I
came
here
to
see
the
sister
for
myself
.
<EOS>
The
first
time
I
stopped
at
the
garden
gate
,
I
made
a
pretext
of
inquiring
into
the
character
of
a
poor
neighbour
;
but
I
wandered
out
of
that
tract
,
and
<EOS>
I
think
Miss
Harriet
mistrusted
me
.
<EOS>
The
second
time
I
asked
leave
to
come
in
;
came
in
;
and
said
what
I
wished
to
say
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
showed
me
reasons
which
I
dared
not
dispute
,
for
receiving
no
assistance
from
me
then
;
but
I
established
a
means
of
communication
between
us
,
which
remained
unbroken
until
within
these
few
days
,
when
I
was
prevented
,
by
important
matters
that
have
lately
devolved
upon
me
,
from
maintaining
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
little
I
have
suspected
this
,
"
said
John
Carker
,
"
when
I
have
seen
you
every
day
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
If
Harriet
could
have
guessed
your
name
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
John
,
"
interposed
the
visitor
,
"
I
kept
it
to
myself
for
two
reasons
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
the
first
might
have
been
binding
alone
;
but
one
has
no
business
to
take
credit
for
good
intentions
,
and
I
made
up
my
mind
,
at
all
events
,
not
to
disclose
myself
until
I
should
be
able
to
do
you
some
real
service
or
other
.
<EOS>
My
second
reason
was
,
that
I
always
hoped
there
might
be
some
lingering
possibility
of
your
brother
's
relenting
towards
you
both
;
and
in
that
case
,
I
felt
that
where
there
was
the
chance
of
a
man
of
his
suspicious
,
watchful
character
,
discovering
that
you
had
been
secretly
befriended
by
me
,
there
was
the
chance
of
a
new
and
fatal
cause
of
division
.
<EOS>
I
resolved
,
to
be
sure
,
at
the
risk
of
turning
his
displeasure
against
myself
---
which
would
have
been
no
matter
---
to
watch
my
opportunity
of
serving
you
with
the
head
of
the
House
;
but
the
distractions
of
death
,
courtship
,
marriage
,
and
domestic
unhappiness
,
have
left
us
no
head
but
your
brother
for
this
long
,
long
time
.
<EOS>
And
it
would
have
been
better
for
us
,
"
said
the
visitor
,
dropping
his
voice
,
"
to
have
been
a
lifeless
trunk
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
seemed
conscious
that
these
latter
words
had
escaped
him
against
his
will
,
and
stretching
out
a
hand
to
the
brother
,
and
a
hand
to
the
sister
,
continued
:
  
"
All
I
could
desire
to
say
,
and
more
,
I
have
now
said
.
<EOS>
All
I
mean
goes
beyond
words
,
as
I
hope
you
understand
and
believe
.
<EOS>
The
time
has
come
,
John
---
though
most
unfortunately
and
unhappily
come
---
when
I
may
help
you
without
interfering
with
that
redeeming
struggle
,
which
has
lasted
through
so
many
years
;
since
you
were
discharged
from
it
to
-
day
by
no
act
of
your
own
.
<EOS>
It
is
late
;
I
need
say
no
more
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
You
will
guard
the
treasure
you
have
here
,
without
advice
or
reminder
from
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
these
words
he
rose
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
go
you
first
,
John
,
"
he
said
good
-
humouredly
,
"
with
a
light
,
without
saying
what
you
want
to
say
,
whatever
that
may
be
;
"
John
Carker
's
heart
was
full
,
and
he
would
have
relieved
it
in
speech
,
if
he
could
;
"
and
let
me
have
a
word
with
your
sister
.
<EOS>
We
have
talked
alone
before
,
and
in
this
room
too
;
though
it
looks
more
natural
with
you
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
Following
him
out
with
his
eyes
,
he
turned
kindly
to
Harriet
,
and
said
in
a
lower
voice
,
and
with
an
altered
and
graver
manner
:
  
"
You
wish
to
ask
me
something
of
the
man
whose
sister
it
is
your
misfortune
to
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dread
to
ask
,
"
said
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
looked
so
earnestly
at
me
more
than
once
,
"
rejoined
the
visitor
,
"
<EOS>
that
I
think
I
can
divine
your
question
.
<EOS>
Has
he
taken
money
?
<EOS>
Is
it
that
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
Heaven
!
"
said
Harriet
.
<EOS>
"
For
the
sake
of
John
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
he
has
abused
his
trust
in
many
ways
,
"
said
Mr
Morfin
;
"
that
he
has
oftener
dealt
and
speculated
to
advantage
for
himself
,
than
for
the
House
he
represented
;
that
he
has
led
the
House
on
,
to
prodigious
ventures
,
often
resulting
in
enormous
losses
;
that
he
has
always
pampered
the
vanity
and
ambition
of
his
employer
,
when
it
was
his
duty
to
have
held
them
in
check
,
and
shown
,
as
it
was
in
his
power
to
do
,
to
what
they
tended
here
or
other
;
will
not
,
perhaps
,
surprise
you
now
.
<EOS>
Undertakings
have
been
entered
on
,
to
swell
the
reputation
of
the
house
for
vast
resources
,
and
to
exhibit
it
in
magnificent
contrast
to
other
merchants
'
houses
,
of
which
it
requires
a
steady
head
to
contemplate
the
possibly
---
a
few
disastrous
changes
of
affairs
might
render
them
the
probably
---
ruinous
consequences
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
many
transactions
of
the
House
,
in
most
parts
of
the
world
:
a
great
labyrinth
of
which
only
he
has
held
the
clue
:
he
has
had
the
opportunity
,
and
he
seems
to
have
used
it
,
of
keeping
the
various
results
afloat
,
when
ascertained
,
and
substituting
estimates
and
generalities
for
facts
.
<EOS>
But
latterly
---
you
follow
me
,
Miss
Harriet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
perfectly
,
"
she
answered
,
with
her
frightened
face
fixed
on
his
.
"
<EOS>
Pray
tell
me
all
the
worst
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Latterly
,
he
appears
to
have
devoted
the
greatest
pains
to
making
these
results
so
plain
and
clear
,
that
reference
to
the
private
books
enables
one
to
grasp
them
,
numerous
and
varying
as
they
are
,
with
extraordinary
ease
.
<EOS>
As
if
he
had
resolved
to
show
his
employer
at
one
broad
view
what
has
been
brought
upon
him
by
ministration
to
his
ruling
passion!That
it
has
been
his
constant
practice
to
minister
to
that
passion
basely
,
and
to
flatter
it
corruptly
,
is
indubitable
.
<EOS>
In
that
,
his
criminality
,
as
it
is
connected
with
the
affairs
of
the
House
,
chiefly
consists
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
One
other
word
before
you
leave
me
,
dear
Sir
,
"
said
Harriet
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
danger
in
all
this
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
How
danger
?
<EOS>
"
he
returned
,
with
a
little
hesitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
the
credit
of
the
House
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
help
answering
you
plainly
,
and
trusting
you
completely
,
"
said
Mr
Morfin
,
after
a
moment
's
survey
of
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
.
<EOS>
Indeed
you
may
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
may
.
<EOS>
Danger
to
the
House
's
credit
?
<EOS>
No
;
none
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
difficulty
,
greater
or
less
difficulty
,
but
no
danger
,
unless
---
unless
,
indeed
---
the
head
of
the
House
,
unable
to
bring
his
mind
to
the
reduction
of
its
enterprises
,
and
positively
refusing
to
believe
that
it
is
,
or
can
be
,
in
any
position
but
the
position
in
which
he
has
always
represented
it
to
himself
,
should
urge
it
beyond
its
strength
.
<EOS>
Then
it
would
totter
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
there
is
no
apprehension
of
that
?
"
said
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
shall
be
no
half
-
confidence
,
"
he
replied
,
shaking
her
hand
,
"
between
us
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
is
unapproachable
by
any
one
,
and
his
state
of
mind
is
haughty
,
rash
,
unreasonable
,
and
ungovernable
,
now
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
disturbed
and
agitated
now
beyond
all
common
bounds
,
and
it
may
pass
.
<EOS>
You
now
know
all
,
both
worst
and
best
.
<EOS>
No
more
to
-
night
,
and
good
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
he
kissed
her
hand
,
and
,
passing
out
to
the
door
where
her
brother
stood
awaiting
his
coming
,
put
him
cheerfully
aside
when
he
essayed
to
speak
;
told
him
that
,
as
they
would
see
each
other
soon
and
often
,
he
might
speak
at
another
time
,
if
he
would
,
but
there
was
no
leisure
for
it
then
;
and
went
away
at
a
round
pace
,
in
order
that
no
word
of
gratitude
might
follow
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
brother
and
sister
sat
conversing
by
the
fireside
,
until
it
was
almost
day
;
made
sleepless
by
this
glimpse
of
the
new
world
that
opened
before
them
,
and
feeling
like
two
people
shipwrecked
long
ago
,
upon
a
solitary
coast
,
to
whom
a
ship
had
come
at
last
,
when
they
were
old
in
resignation
,
and
had
lost
all
thought
of
any
other
home
.
<EOS>
But
another
and
different
kind
of
disquietude
kept
them
waking
too
.
<EOS>
The
darkness
out
of
which
this
light
had
broken
on
them
gathered
around
;
and
the
shadow
of
their
guilty
brother
was
in
the
house
where
his
foot
had
never
trod
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
to
be
driven
out
,
nor
did
it
fade
before
the
sun
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
it
was
there
;
at
noon
;
at
night
.
<EOS>
Darkest
and
most
distinct
at
night
,
as
is
now
to
be
told
.
  
<EOS>
John
Carker
had
gone
out
,
in
pursuance
of
a
letter
of
appointment
from
their
friend
,
and
Harriet
was
left
in
the
house
alone
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
alone
some
houses
.
<EOS>
A
dull
,
grave
evening
,
and
a
deepening
twilight
,
were
not
favourable
to
the
removal
of
the
oppression
on
her
spirits
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
this
brother
,
long
unseen
and
unknown
,
flitted
about
her
in
frightful
shapes
.
<EOS>
He
was
dead
,
dying
,
calling
to
her
,
staring
at
her
,
frowning
on
her
.
<EOS>
The
pictures
in
her
mind
were
so
obtrusive
and
exact
that
,
as
the
twilight
deepened
,
she
dreaded
to
raise
her
head
and
look
at
the
dark
corners
of
the
room
,
lest
his
wraith
,
the
offspring
of
her
excited
imagination
,
should
be
waiting
there
,
to
startle
her
.
<EOS>
Once
she
had
such
a
fancy
of
his
being
in
the
next
room
,
hiding
---
though
she
knew
quite
well
what
a
distempered
fancy
<EOS>
it
was
,
and
had
no
belief
in
it
---
that
she
forced
herself
to
go
there
,
for
her
own
conviction
.
<EOS>
But
in
vain
.
<EOS>
The
room
resumed
its
shadowy
terrors
,
the
moment
she
left
it
;
and
she
had
no
more
power
to
divest
herself
of
these
vague
impressions
of
dread
,
than
if
they
had
been
stone
giants
,
rooted
in
the
solid
earth
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
almost
dark
,
and
she
was
sitting
near
the
window
,
with
her
head
upon
her
hand
,
looking
down
,
when
,
sensible
of
a
sudden
increase
in
the
gloom
of
the
apartment
,
she
raised
her
eyes
,
and
uttered
an
involuntary
cry
.
<EOS>
Close
to
the
glass
,
a
pale
scared
face
gazed
in
;
vacantly
,
for
an
instant
,
as
searching
for
an
object
;
then
the
eyes
rested
on
herself
,
and
lighted
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
in
!
<EOS>
Let
me
in
!
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
you
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
hand
rattled
on
the
glass
.
  
<EOS>
She
recognised
immediately
the
woman
with
the
long
dark
hair
,
to
whom
she
had
given
warmth
,
food
,
and
shelter
,
one
wet
night
.
<EOS>
Naturally
afraid
of
her
,
remembering
her
violent
behaviour
,
Harriet
,
retreating
a
little
from
the
window
,
stood
undecided
and
alarmed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
in
!
<EOS>
Let
me
speak
to
you
!
<EOS>
I
am
thankful
---
quiet
---
humble
---
<EOS>
anything
you
like
.
<EOS>
But
let
me
speak
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
vehement
manner
of
the
entreaty
,
the
earnest
expression
of
the
face
,
the
trembling
of
the
two
hands
that
were
raised
imploringly
,
a
certain
dread
and
terror
in
the
voice
akin
to
her
own
condition
at
the
moment
,
prevailed
with
Harriet
.
<EOS>
She
hastened
to
the
door
and
opened
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
come
in
,
or
shall
I
speak
here
?
"
said
the
woman
,
catching
at
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
that
you
want
?
<EOS>
What
is
it
that
you
have
to
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
much
,
but
let
me
say
it
out
,
or
I
shall
never
say
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
tempted
now
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
There
seem
to
be
hands
dragging
me
from
the
door
.
<EOS>
Let
me
come
in
,
if
you
can
trust
me
for
this
once
!
"
  
<EOS>
Her
energy
again
prevailed
,
and
they
passed
into
the
firelight
of
the
little
kitchen
,
where
she
had
before
sat
,
and
ate
,
and
dried
her
clothes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
there
,
"
said
Alice
,
kneeling
down
beside
her
,
"
and
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
You
remember
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
what
I
told
you
I
had
been
,
and
where
I
came
from
,
ragged
and
lame
,
with
the
fierce
wind
and
weather
beating
on
my
head
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
how
I
came
back
that
night
,
and
threw
your
money
in
the
dirt
,
and
cursed
you
and
your
race
.
<EOS>
Now
,
see
me
here
,
upon
my
knees
.
<EOS>
Am
I
less
earnest
now
,
than
I
was
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
what
you
ask
,
"
said
Harriet
,
gently
,
"
is
forgiveness
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
it
's
not
!
"
returned
the
other
,
with
a
proud
,
fierce
look
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
ask
is
to
be
believed
.
<EOS>
Now
you
shall
judge
if
I
am
worthy
of
belief
,
both
as
I
was
,
and
as
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
Still
upon
her
knees
,
and
with
her
eyes
upon
the
fire
,
and
the
fire
shining
on
her
ruined
beauty
and
her
wild
black
hair
,
one
long
trees
of
which
she
pulled
over
her
shoulder
,
and
wound
about
her
hand
,
and
thoughtfully
bit
and
tore
while
speaking
,
she
went
on
:
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
was
young
and
pretty
,
and
this
,
"
plucking
contemptuously
at
the
hair
she
held
,
"
was
only
handled
delicately
,
and
could
n't
be
admired
enough
,
my
mother
,
who
had
not
been
very
mindful
of
me
as
a
child
,
found
out
my
merits
,
and
was
fond
of
me
,
and
proud
of
me
.
<EOS>
She
was
covetous
and
poor
,
and
thought
to
make
a
sort
of
property
of
me
.
<EOS>
No
great
lady
ever
thought
that
of
a
daughter
yet
,
I
'm
sure
,
or
acted
as
if
she
did
<EOS>
---
it
's
never
done
,
we
all
know
---
and
that
shows
that
the
only
instances
of
mothers
bringing
up
their
daughters
wrong
,
and
evil
coming
of
it
,
are
among
such
miserable
folks
as
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
Looking
at
the
fire
,
as
if
she
were
forgetful
,
for
the
moment
,
of
having
any
auditor
,
she
continued
in
a
dreamy
way
as
she
wound
the
long
tress
of
hair
tight
round
and
round
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
came
of
that
,
I
need
n't
say
.
<EOS>
Wretched
marriages
do
n't
come
of
such
things
,
in
our
degree
;
only
wretchedness
and
ruin
.
<EOS>
Wretchedness
and
ruin
came
on
me
---
came
on
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Raising
her
eyes
swiftly
from
their
moody
gaze
upon
the
fire
,
to
Harriet
's
face
,
she
said
:
  
"
I
am
wasting
time
,
and
there
is
none
to
spare
;
yet
if
I
had
n't
thought
of
all
,
I
should
n't
be
here
now
.
<EOS>
Wretchedness
and
ruin
came
on
me
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
I
was
made
a
short
-
lived
toy
,
and
flung
aside
more
cruelly
and
carelessly
than
even
such
things
are
.
<EOS>
By
whose
hand
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
ask
me
?
"
said
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
tremble
?
<EOS>
"
rejoined
Alice
,
with
an
eager
look
.
"
<EOS>
His
usage
made
a
Devil
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
sunk
in
wretchedness
and
ruin
,
lower
and
lower
yet
.
<EOS>
I
was
concerned
in
a
robbery
---
in
every
part
of
it
but
the
gains
---
and
was
found
out
,
and
sent
to
be
tried
,
without
a
friend
,
without
a
penny
.
<EOS>
Though
I
was
but
a
girl
,
I
would
have
gone
to
Death
,
sooner
than
ask
him
for
a
word
,
if
a
word
of
his
could
have
saved
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
!
<EOS>
To
any
death
that
could
have
been
invented
.
<EOS>
But
my
mother
,
covetous
always
,
sent
to
him
in
my
name
,
told
the
true
story
of
my
case
,
and
humbly
prayed
and
petitioned
for
a
small
last
gift
---
for
not
so
many
pounds
as
I
have
fingers
on
this
hand
.
<EOS>
Who
was
it
,
do
you
think
,
who
snapped
his
fingers
at
me
in
my
misery
,
lying
,
as
he
believed
,
at
his
feet
,
and
left
me
without
even
this
poor
sign
of
remembrance
;
well
satisfied
that
I
should
be
sent
abroad
,
beyond
the
reach
of
further
trouble
to
him
,
and
should
die
,
and
rot
there
?
<EOS>
Who
was
this
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
ask
me
?
"
repeated
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
tremble
?
"
said
Alice
,
laying
her
hand
upon
her
arm
,
and
looking
in
her
face
,
"
but
that
the
answer
is
on
your
lips
!
<EOS>
It
was
your
brother
James
.
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
trembled
more
and
more
,
but
did
not
avert
her
eyes
from
the
eager
look
that
rested
on
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
knew
you
were
his
sister
---
which
was
on
that
night
---
I
came
back
,
weary
and
lame
,
to
spurn
your
gift
.
<EOS>
I
felt
that
night
as
if
I
could
have
travelled
,
weary
and
lame
,
over
the
whole
world
,
to
stab
him
,
if
I
could
have
found
him
in
a
lonely
place
with
no
one
near
.
<EOS>
Do
you
believe
that
I
was
earnest
in
all
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
!
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
,
why
are
you
come
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Since
then
,
"
said
Alice
,
with
the
same
grasp
of
her
arm
,
and
the
same
look
in
her
face
,
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
him
!
<EOS>
I
have
followed
him
with
my
eyes
,
in
the
broad
day
.
<EOS>
If
any
spark
of
my
resentment
slumbered
in
my
bosom
,
it
sprung
into
a
blaze
when
my
eyes
rested
on
him
.
<EOS>
You
know
he
has
wronged
a
proud
man
,
and
made
him
his
deadly
enemy
.
<EOS>
What
if
I
had
given
information
of
him
to
that
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Information
!
"
repeated
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
if
I
had
found
out
one
who
knew
your
brother
's
secret
;
who
knew
the
manner
of
his
flight
;
who
knew
where
he
and
the
companion
of
his
flight
were
gone
?
<EOS>
What
<EOS>
if
I
had
made
him
utter
all
his
knowledge
,
<EOS>
word
by
word
,
before
his
enemy
,
concealed
to
hear
it
?
<EOS>
What
if
I
had
sat
by
at
the
time
,
looking
into
this
enemy
's
face
,
and
seeing
it
change
till
it
was
scarcely
human
?
<EOS>
What
<EOS>
if
I
had
seen
him
rush
away
,
mad
,
in
pursuit
?
<EOS>
What
if
I
knew
,
now
,
that
he
was
on
his
road
,
more
fiend
than
man
,
and
must
,
in
so
many
hours
,
come
up
with
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Remove
your
hand
!
"
said
Harriet
,
recoiling
.
<EOS>
"
Go
away!Your
touch
is
dreadful
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
this
,
"
pursued
the
other
,
with
her
eager
look
,
regardless
of
the
interruption
.
<EOS>
"
Do
I
speak
and
look
as
if
I
really
had
?
<EOS>
Do
you
believe
what
I
am
saying
?

<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
must

<EOS>
Let
my
arm
go
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
yet
.
<EOS>
A
moment
more
.
<EOS>
You
can
think
what
my
revengeful
purpose
must
have
been
,
to
last
so
long
,
and
urge
me
to
do
this
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dreadful
!
"
said
Harriet
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
when
you
see
me
now
,
"
said
Alice
hoarsely
,
"
here
again
,
kneeling
quietly
on
the
ground
,
with
my
touch
upon
your
arm

with
my
eyes
upon
your
face
<EOS>
,
you
may
believe
that
there
is
no
common
earnestness
in
what
I
say
,
and
that
no
common
struggle
has
been
battling
in
my
breast
.
<EOS>
I
am
ashamed
to
speak
the
words
,
but
I
relent
.
<EOS>
I
despise
myself
;
I
have
fought
with
myself
all
day
,
and
all
last
night
;
but
I
relent
towards
him
without
reason
,
and
wish
to
repair
what
I
have
done
,
if
it
is
possible
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
them
come
together
while
his
pursuer
is
so
blind
and
headlong
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
seen
him
as
he
went
out
last
night
,
you
would
know
the
danger
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
shall
it
be
prevented
?
<EOS>
"
What
can
I
do
?
"
cried
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
night
long
,
"
pursued
the
other
,
hurriedly
,
"
I
had
dreams
of
him
---
and
yet
I
did
n't
sleep
---
in
his
blood
.
<EOS>
All
day
,
I
have
had
him
near
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
I
do
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Harriet
,
shuddering
at
these
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
there
is
any
one
who
'll
write
,
or
send
,
or
go
to
him
,
let
them
lose
no
time
.
<EOS>
He
is
at
Dijon
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
the
name
,
and
where
it
is
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Warn
him
that
the
man
he
has
made
his
enemy
is
in
a
frenzy
,
and
that
he
does
n't
know
him
if
he
makes
light
of
his
approach
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
that
he
is
on
the
road
---
<EOS>
I
know
he
is
!
<EOS>
---
and
hurrying
on
.
<EOS>
Urge
him
to
get
away
while
there
is
time
---
if
there
is
time
---
and
not
to
meet
him
yet
.
<EOS>
A
month
or
so
will
make
years
of
difference
.
<EOS>
Let
them
not
encounter
,
through
me
.
<EOS>
Anywhere
but
there
!
<EOS>
Any
time
but
now
!
<EOS>
Let
his
foe
follow
him
,
and
find
him
for
himself
,
but
not
through
me!There
<EOS>
is
enough
upon
my
head
without
.

<EOS>
The
fire
ceased
to
be
reflected
in
her
jet
black
hair
,
uplifted
face
,
and
eager
eyes
;
her
hand
was
gone
from
Harriet
's
arm
;
and
the
place
where
she
had
been
was
empty

<EOS>
The
Fugitives
 
<EOS>
THE
time
,
an
hour
short
of
midnight
;
the
place
,
a
French
apartment
,
comprising
some
half
-
dozen
rooms
;
---
a
dull
cold
hall
or
corridor
,
a
dining
-
room
a
drawing
-
room
,
a
bed
-
chamber
,
and
an
inner
drawing
-
room
,
or
boudoir
,
smaller
and
more
retired
than
the
rest
.
<EOS>
All
these
shut
in
by
one
large
pair
of
doors
on
the
main
staircase
,
but
each
room
provided
with
two
or
three
pairs
of
doors
of
its
own
,
establishing
several
means
of
communication
with
the
remaining
portion
of
the
apartment
,
or
with
certain
small
passages
within
the
wall
,
leading
,
as
is
not
unusual
in
such
houses
,
to
some
back
stairs
with
an
obscure
outlet
below
.
<EOS>
The
whole
situated
on
the
first
floor
of
so
large
an
Hotel
,
that
it
did
not
absorb
one
entire
row
of
windows
upon
one
side
of
the
square
court
-
yard
in
the
centre
,
upon
which
the
whole
four
sides
of
the
mansion
looked
.
  
<EOS>
An
air
of
splendour
,
sufficiently
faded
to
be
melancholy
,
and
sufficiently
dazzling
to
clog
and
embarrass
the
details
of
life
with
a
show
of
state
,
reigned
in
these
rooms
.
<EOS>
The
walls
and
ceilings
were
gilded
and
painted
;
the
floors
were
waxed
and
polished
;
crimson
drapery
hung
in
festoons
from
window
,
door
,
and
mirror
;
candelabra
,
gnarled
and
intertwisted
,
like
the
branches
of
trees
,
or
horns
of
animals
,
stuck
out
from
the
panels
of
the
wall
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
day
-
time
,
when
the
lattice
-
blinds
(
now
closely
shut
)
were
opened
,
and
the
light
let
in
,
traces
were
discernible
among
this
finery
,
of
wear
and
tear
and
dust
,
of
sun
and
damp
and
smoke
,
and
lengthened
intervals
of
want
of
use
and
habitation
,
when
such
shows
and
toys
of
life
seem
sensitive
like
life
,
and
waste
as
men
shut
up
in
prison
do
.
<EOS>
Even
night
,
and
clusters
of
burning
candles
,
could
not
wholly
efface
them
,
though
the
general
glitter
threw
them
in
the
shade
.
  
<EOS>
The
glitter
of
bright
tapers
,
and
their
reflection
in
looking
-
glasses
,
scraps
of
gilding
and
gay
colours
,
were
confined
,
on
this
night
,
to
one
room
---
that
smaller
room
within
the
rest
,
just
now
enumerated
.
<EOS>
Seen
from
the
hall
,
where
a
lamp
was
feebly
burning
,
through
the
dark
perspective
of
open
doors
,
it
looked
as
shining
and
precious
as
a
gem
.
<EOS>
In
the
heart
of
its
radiance
sat
a
beautiful
woman
---
Edith
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
alone
.
<EOS>
The
same
defiant
,
scornful
woman
still
.
<EOS>
The
cheek
a
little
worn
,
the
eye
a
little
larger
in
appearance
,
and
more
lustrous
,
but
the
haughty
bearing
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
No
shame
upon
her
brow
;
no
late
repentance
bending
her
disdainful
neck
.
<EOS>
Imperious
and
stately
yet
,
and
yet
regardless
of
herself
and
of
all
else
,
she
sat
with
her
dark
eyes
cast
down
,
waiting
for
some
one
.
  
<EOS>
No
book
,
no
work
,
no
occupation
of
any
kind
but
her
own
thought
,
beguiled
the
tardy
time
.
<EOS>
Some
purpose
,
strong
enough
to
fill
up
any
pause
,
possessed
her
.
<EOS>
With
her
lips
pressed
together
,
and
quivering
if
for
a
moment
she
released
them
from
her
control
;
with
her
nostril
inflated
;
her
hands
clasped
in
one
another
;
and
her
purpose
swelling
in
her
breast
;
she
sat
,
and
waited
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
sound
of
a
key
in
the
outer
door
,
and
a
footstep
in
the
hall
,
she
started
up
,
and
cried
"
Who
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
The
answer
was
in
French
,
and
two
men
came
in
with
jingling
trays
,
to
make
preparation
for
supper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
had
bade
them
to
do
so
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
had
commanded
it
,
when
it
was
his
pleasure
to
take
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
had
said
,
when
he
stayed
there
for
an
hour
,
en
route
,
and
left
the
letter
for
Madame
---
Madame
had
received
it
surely
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
thousand
pardons
!
<EOS>
The
sudden
apprehension
that
it
might
have
been
forgotten
had
struck
him
;
"
a
bald
man
,
with
a
large
beard
from
a
neighbouring
restaurant
:
"
with
despair!Monsieur
had
said
that
supper
was
to
be
ready
at
that
hour
:
also
that
he
had
forewarned
Madame
of
the
commands
he
had
given
,
in
his
letter
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
had
done
the
Golden
Head
the
honour
to
request
that
the
supper
should
be
choice
and
delicate
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
would
find
that
his
confidence
in
the
Golden
Head
was
not
misplaced
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
said
no
more
,
but
looked
on
thoughtfully
while
they
prepared
the
table
for
two
persons
,
and
set
the
wine
upon
it
.
<EOS>
She
arose
before
they
had
finished
,
and
taking
a
lamp
,
passed
into
the
bed
-
chamber
and
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
where
she
hurriedly
but
narrowly
examined
all
the
doors
;
particularly
one
in
the
former
room
that
opened
on
the
passage
in
the
wall
.
<EOS>
From
this
she
took
the
key
,
and
put
it
on
the
outer
side
.
<EOS>
She
then
came
back
.
  
<EOS>
The
men
---
the
second
of
whom
was
a
dark
,
bilious
subject
,
in
a
jacket
,
close
shaved
,
and
with
a
black
head
of
hair
close
cropped
---
had
completed
their
preparation
of
the
table
,
and
were
standing
looking
at
it
.
<EOS>
He
who
had
spoken
before
,
inquired
whether
Madame
thought
it
would
be
long
before
Monsieur
arrived
?
  
<EOS>
"
She
could
n't
say
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
!
<EOS>
There
was
the
supper
!
<EOS>
It
should
be
eaten
on
the
instant
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
(
who
spoke
French
like
an
Angel
---
or
a
Frenchman
<EOS>
---
it
was
all
the
same
)
had
spoken
with
great
emphasis
of
his
punctuality
.
<EOS>
But
the
English
nation
had
so
grand
a
genius
for
punctuality
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
what
noise
!
<EOS>
Great
Heaven
,
here
was
Monsieur
.
<EOS>
Behold
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
effect
,
Monsieur
,
admitted
by
the
other
of
the
two
,
came
,
with
his
gleaming
teeth
,
through
the
dark
rooms
,
like
a
mouth
;
and
arriving
in
that
sanctuary
of
light
and
colour
,
a
figure
at
full
length
,
embraced
Madame
,
and
addressed
her
in
the
French
tongue
as
his
charming
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
God
!
<EOS>
Madame
is
going
to
faint
.
<EOS>
Madame
is
overcome
with
joy
!
"
<EOS>
The
bald
man
with
the
beard
observed
it
,
and
cried
out
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
had
only
shrunk
and
shivered
.
<EOS>
Before
the
words
were
spoken
,
she
was
standing
with
her
hand
upon
the
velvet
back
of
a
great
chair
;
her
figure
drawn
up
to
its
full
height
,
and
her
face
immoveable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Francois
has
flown
over
to
the
Golden
Head
for
supper
.
<EOS>
He
flies
on
these
occasions
like
an
angel
or
a
bird
.
<EOS>
The
baggage
of
Monsieur
is
in
his
room
.
<EOS>
All
is
arranged
.
<EOS>
The
supper
will
be
here
this
moment
.
"
<EOS>
These
facts
the
bald
man
notified
with
bows
and
smiles
,
and
presently
the
supper
came
.
  
<EOS>
The
hot
dishes
were
on
a
chafing
-
dish
;
the
cold
already
set
forth
,
with
the
change
of
service
on
a
sideboard
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
was
satisfied
with
this
arrangement
.
<EOS>
The
supper
table
being
small
,
it
pleased
him
very
well
.
<EOS>
Let
them
set
the
chafing
-
dish
upon
the
floor
,
and
go
.
<EOS>
He
would
remove
the
dishes
with
his
own
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
!
"
said
the
bald
man
,
politely
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
impossible
!
"
  
<EOS>
Monsieur
was
of
another
opinion
.
<EOS>
He
required
no
further
attendance
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
Madame'the
bald
man
hinted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madame
,
"
replied
Monsieur
,
"
had
her
own
maid
.
<EOS>
It
was
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
million
pardons
!
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
Madame
had
no
maid
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
came
here
alone
,
"
said
Edith
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
my
choice
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
am
well
used
to
travelling
;
I
want
no
attendance
.
<EOS>
They
need
send
nobody
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Monsieur
accordingly
,
persevering
in
his
first
proposed
impossibility
,
proceeded
to
follow
the
two
attendants
to
the
outer
door
,
and
secure
it
after
them
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
The
bald
man
turning
round
to
bow
,
as
he
went
out
,
observed
that
Madame
still
stood
with
her
hand
upon
the
velvet
back
of
the
great
chair
,
and
that
her
face
was
quite
regardless
of
him
,
though
she
was
looking
straight
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
sound
of
Carker
's
fastening
the
door
resounded
through
the
intermediate
rooms
,
and
seemed
to
come
hushed
and
stifled
into
that
last
distant
one
,
the
sound
of
the
Cathedral
clock
striking
twelve
mingled
with
it
,
in
Edith
's
ears
.
<EOS>
She
heard
him
pause
,
as
if
he
heard
it
too
and
listened
;
and
then
came
back
towards
her
,
laying
a
long
train
of
footsteps
through
the
silence
,
and
shutting
all
the
doors
behind
him
as
he
came
along
.
<EOS>
Her
hand
,
for
a
moment
,
left
the
velvet
chair
to
bring
a
knife
within
her
reach
upon
the
table
;
then
she
stood
as
she
had
stood
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
strange
to
come
here
by
yourself
,
my
love
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
as
he
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
she
returned
.
  
<EOS>
Her
tone
was
so
harsh
;
the
quick
turn
of
her
head
so
fierce
;
her
attitude
so
repellent
;
and
her
frown
so
black
;
that
he
stood
,
with
the
lamp
in
his
hand
,
looking
at
her
,
as
if
she
had
struck
him
motionless
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
he
at
length
repeated
,
putting
down
the
lamp
,
and
smiling
his
most
courtly
smile
,
"
how
strange
to
come
here
alone
!
<EOS>
It
was
unnecessary
caution
surely
,
and
might
have
defeated
itself
.
<EOS>
You
were
to
have
engaged
an
attendant
at
Havre
or
Rouen
,
and
have
had
abundance
of
time
for
the
purpose
,
though
you
had
been
the
most
capricious
and
difficult
(
as
you
are
the
most
beautiful
,
my
love
)
of
women
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
eyes
gleamed
strangely
on
him
,
but
she
stood
with
her
hand
resting
on
the
chair
,
and
said
not
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
,
"
resumed
Carker
,
"
seen
you
look
so
handsome
,
as
you
do
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Even
the
picture
I
have
carried
in
my
mind
during
this
cruel
probation
,
and
which
I
have
contemplated
night
and
day
,
is
exceeded
by
the
reality
.
"
  
<EOS>
Not
a
word
.
<EOS>
Not
a
look
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
completely
hidden
by
their
drooping
lashes
,
but
her
head
held
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hard
,
unrelenting
terms
they
were
!
"
said
Carker
,
with
a
smile
,
"
but
they
are
all
fulfilled
and
passed
,
and
make
the
present
more
delicious
and
more
safe
.
<EOS>
Sicily
shall
be
the
place
of
our
retreat
.
<EOS>
In
the
idlest
and
easiest
part
of
the
world
,
my
soul
,
we
'll
both
seek
compensation
for
old
slavery
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
coming
gaily
towards
her
,
when
,
in
an
instant
,
she
caught
the
knife
up
from
the
table
,
and
started
one
pace
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stand
still
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
or
I
shall
murder
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
sudden
change
in
her
,
the
towering
fury
and
intense
abhorrence
sparkling
in
her
eyes
and
lighting
up
her
brow
,
made
him
stop
as
if
a
fire
had
stopped
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stand
still
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
come
no
nearer
me
,
upon
your
life
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
both
stood
looking
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
Rage
and
astonishment
were
in
his
face
,
but
he
controlled
them
and
said
lightly
,
  
"
<EOS>
Come
,
come
!
<EOS>
Tush
,
we
are
alone
,
and
out
of
everybody
's
sight
and
hearing
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
to
frighten
me
with
these
tricks
of
virtue
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
to
frighten
me
,
"
she
answered
fiercely
,
"
from
any
purpose
that
I
have
,
and
any
course
I
am
resolved
upon
,
by
reminding
me
of
the
solitude
of
this
place
,
and
there
being
no
help
near
?
<EOS>
Me
,
who
am
here
alone
,
designedly
?
<EOS>
If
I
feared
you
,
should
I
not
have
avoided
you
?
<EOS>
If
I
feared
you
,
should
I
be
here
,
in
the
dead
of
night
,
telling
you
to
your
face
what
I
am
going
to
tell
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
what
is
that
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
handsome
shrew
?
<EOS>
Handsomer
so
,
than
any
other
woman
in
her
best
humour
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
nothing
,
"
she
returned
,
"
until
you
go
back
to
that
chair
---
except
this
,
once
again
---
<EOS>
Do
n't
come
near
me
!
<EOS>
Not
a
step
nearer
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
if
you
do
,
as
heaven
sees
us
,
I
shall
murder
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mistake
me
for
your
husband
?
<EOS>
"
he
retorted
,
with
a
grin
.
  
<EOS>
Disdaining
to
reply
,
she
stretched
her
arm
out
,
pointing
to
the
chair
.
<EOS>
He
bit
his
lip
,
frowned
,
laughed
,
and
sat
down
in
it
,
with
a
baffled
,
irresolute
,
impatient
air
,
he
was
unable
to
conceal
;
and
biting
his
nail
nervously
,
and
looking
at
her
sideways
,
with
bitter
discomfiture
,
even
while
he
feigned
to
be
amused
by
her
caprice
.
  
<EOS>
She
put
the
knife
down
upon
the
table
,
and
touching
her
bosom
with
her
hand
,
said
:
  
"
I
have
something
lying
here
that
is
no
love
trinket
;
and
sooner
than
endure
your
touch
once
more
,
I
would
use
it
on
you
---
<EOS>
and
you
know
it
,
while
I
speak
---
with
less
reluctance
than
I
would
on
any
other
creeping
thing
that
lives
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
affected
to
laugh
jestingly
,
and
entreated
her
to
act
her
play
out
quickly
,
for
the
supper
was
growing
cold
.
<EOS>
But
the
secret
look
with
which
he
regarded
her
,
was
more
sullen
and
lowering
,
and
he
struck
his
foot
once
upon
the
floor
with
a
muttered
oath
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
many
times
,
"
said
Edith
,
<EOS>
bending
her
darkest
glance
upon
him
,
"
has
your
bold
knavery
assailed
me
with
outrage
and
insult
?
<EOS>
How
many
times
in
your
smooth
manner
,
and
mocking
words
and
looks
,
have
I
been
twitted
with
my
courtship
and
my
marriage
?
<EOS>
How
many
times
have
you
laid
bare
my
wound
of
love
for
that
sweet
,
injured
girl
,
and
lacerated
it
?
<EOS>
How
often
have
you
fanned
the
fire
on
which
,
for
two
years
,
I
have
writhed
;
and
tempted
me
to
take
a
desperate
revenge
,
when
it
has
most
tortured
me
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
,
Ma'am
,
"
he
replied
,
"
that
you
have
kept
a
good
account
,
and
that
it
's
pretty
accurate
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Edith
.
<EOS>
To
your
husband
,
poor
wretch
,
this
was
well
enough
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
if
,
"
she
said
,
surveying
him
with
a
haughty
contempt
and
disgust
,
that
he
shrunk
under
,
let
him
brave
it
as
he
would
,
"
if
all
my
other
reasons
for
despising
him
could
have
been
blown
away
like
feathers
,
his
having
you
for
his
counsellor
and
favourite
,
would
have
almost
been
enough
to
hold
their
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
a
reason
why
you
have
run
away
with
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
her
,
tauntingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
why
we
are
face
to
face
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
Wretch!We
meet
to
-
night
,
and
part
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
For
not
one
moment
after
I
have
ceased
to
speak
,
will
I
stay
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
turned
upon
her
with
his
ugliest
look
,
and
griped
the
table
with
his
hand
;
but
neither
rose
,
nor
otherwise
answered
or
threatened
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
woman
,
"
she
said
,
confronting
him
steadfastly
,
"
who
from
her
very
childhood
has
been
shamed
and
steeled
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
offered
and
rejected
,
put
up
and
appraised
,
until
my
very
soul
has
sickened
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
had
an
accomplishment
or
grace
that
might
have
been
a
resource
to
me
,
but
it
has
been
paraded
and
vended
to
enhance
my
value
,
as
if
the
common
crier
had
called
it
through
the
streets
.
<EOS>
My
poor
,
proud
friends
,
have
looked
on
and
approved
;
and
every
tie
between
us
has
been
deadened
in
my
breast
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
one
of
them
for
whom
I
care
,
as
I
could
care
for
a
pet
dog
.
<EOS>
I
stand
alone
in
the
world
,
remembering
well
<EOS>
what
a
hollow
world
it
has
been
to
me
,
and
what
a
hollow
part
of
it
<EOS>
I
have
been
myself
.
<EOS>
You
know
this
,
and
you
know
that
my
fame
with
it
is
worthless
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
imagined
that
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
calculated
on
it
,
"
she
rejoined
,
"
and
so
pursued
me
.
<EOS>
Grown
too
indifferent
for
any
opposition
but
indifference
,
to
the
daily
working
of
the
hands
that
had
moulded
me
to
this
;
and
knowing
that
my
marriage
would
at
least
prevent
their
hawking
of
me
up
and
down
;
I
suffered
myself
to
be
sold
as
infamously
as
any
woman
with
a
halter
round
her
neck
is
sold
in
any
market
-
place
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
,
showing
all
his
teeth
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
calculated
on
it
,
"
she
rejoined
once
more
,
"
and
so
pursued
me
.
<EOS>
From
my
marriage
day
,
I
found
myself
exposed
to
such
new
shame
---
to
such
solicitation
and
pursuit
(
expressed
as
clearly
as
if
it
had
been
written
in
the
coarsest
words
,
and
thrust
into
my
hand
at
every
turn
)
from
one
mean
villain
,
that
I
felt
as
if
I
had
never
known
humiliation
till
that
time
.
<EOS>
This
shame
my
husband
fixed
upon
me
;
hemmed
me
round
with
,
himself
;
steeped
me
in
,
with
his
own
hands
,
and
of
his
own
act
,
repeated
hundreds
of
times
.
<EOS>
And
thus
---
forced
by
the
two
from
every
point
of
rest
I
had
---
forced
by
the
two
to
yield
up
the
last
retreat
of
love
and
gentleness
within
me
,
or
to
be
a
new
misfortune
on
its
innocent
object
---
driven
from
each
to
each
,
and
beset
by
one
when
I
escaped
the
other
---
my
anger
rose
almost
to
distraction
against
both
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
against
which
it
rose
higher
---
the
master
or
the
man
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
watched
her
closely
,
as
she
stood
before
him
in
the
very
triumph
of
her
indignant
beauty
.
<EOS>
She
was
resolute
,
he
saw
;
undauntable
;
with
no
more
fear
of
him
than
of
a
worm
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
should
I
say
of
honour
or
of
chastity
to
you
!
"
<EOS>
she
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
meaning
would
it
have
to
you
;
what
meaning
would
it
have
from
me
!
<EOS>
But
if
I
tell
you
that
the
lightest
touch
of
your
hand
makes
my
blood
cold
with
antipathy
;
that
from
the
hour
when
I
first
saw
and
hated
you
,
to
now
,
when
my
instinctive
repugnance
is
enhanced
by
every
minute
's
knowledge
of
you
<EOS>
I
have
since
had
<EOS>
,
you
have
been
a
loathsome
creature
to
me
which
has
not
its
like
on
earth
;
how
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
answered
with
a
faint
laugh
,
"
Aye
!
<EOS>
How
then
,
my
queen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
that
night
,
when
,
emboldened
by
the
scene
you
had
assisted
at
,
you
dared
come
to
my
room
and
speak
to
me
,
"
she
said
,
"
what
passed
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
laughed
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
passed
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
memory
is
so
distinct
,
"
he
returned
,
"
that
I
have
no
doubt
you
can
recall
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Hear
it
!
<EOS>
Proposing
then
,
this
flight
---
not
this
flight
,
but
the
flight
you
thought
it
---
you
told
me
that
in
the
having
given
you
that
meeting
,
and
leaving
you
to
be
discovered
there
,
if
you
so
thought
fit
;
and
in
the
having
suffered
you
to
be
alone
with
me
many
times
before
,
---
and
having
made
the
opportunities
,
you
said
,
---
and
in
the
having
openly
avowed
to
you
that
I
had
no
feeling
for
my
husband
but
aversion
,
and
no
care
for
myself
---
<EOS>
I
was
lost
;
I
had
given
you
the
power
to
traduce
my
name
;
and
I
lived
,
in
virtuous
reputation
,
at
the
pleasure
of
your
breath
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
stratagems
in
love
---
"
he
interrupted
,
smiling
.
"
<EOS>
The
old
adage
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
On
that
night
,
"
said
Edith
,
"
and
then
the
struggle
that
I
long
had
had
with
something
that
was
not
respect
for
my
good
fame
---
<EOS>
that
was
<EOS>
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
---
<EOS>
perhaps
the
clinging
to
that
last
retreat
---
was
ended
.
<EOS>
On
the
night
,
and
then
,
I
turned
from
every
thing
but
passion
and
resentment
.
<EOS>
I
struck
a
blow
that
laid
your
lofty
master
in
the
dust
,
and
set
you
there
,
before
me
,
looking
at
me
now
,
and
knowing
what
I
mean
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
sprung
up
from
his
chair
with
a
great
oath
.
<EOS>
She
put
her
hand
into
her
bosom
,
and
not
a
finger
trembled
,
not
a
hair
upon
her
head
was
stirred
.
<EOS>
He
stood
still
:
she
too
:
the
table
and
chair
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
forget
that
this
man
put
his
lips
to
mine
that
night
,
and
held
me
in
his
arms
as
he
has
done
again
to
-
night
,
"
said
Edith
,
pointing
at
him
;
"
when
I
forget
the
taint
of
his
kiss
upon
my
cheek
---
the
cheek
that
Florence
would
have
laid
her
guiltless
face
against
---
when
I
forget
my
meeting
with
her
,
while
that
taint
was
hot
upon
me
,
and
in
what
a
flood
the
knowledge
rushed
upon
me
when
I
saw
her
,
that
in
releasing
her
from
the
persecution
I
had
caused
by
my
love
,
I
brought
a
shame
and
degradation
on
her
name
through
mine
,
and
in
all
time
to
come
should
be
the
solitary
figure
representing
in
her
mind
her
first
avoidance
of
a
guilty
creature
---
then
,
Husband
,
from
whom
I
stand
divorced
henceforth
<EOS>
,
I
will
forget
these
last
two
years
,
and
undo
what
I
have
done
,
and
undeceive
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Her
flashing
eyes
,
uplifted
for
a
moment
,
lighted
again
on
Carker
,
and
she
held
some
letters
out
in
her
left
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
See
these
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
addressed
these
to
me
in
the
false
name
you
go
by
;
one
here
,
some
elsewhere
on
my
road
.
<EOS>
The
seals
are
unbroken
.
<EOS>
Take
them
back
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
crunched
them
in
her
hand
,
and
tossed
them
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
And
as
she
looked
upon
him
now
,
a
smile
was
on
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
meet
and
part
to
-
night
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
fallen
on
Sicilian
days
and
sensual
rest
,
too
soon
.
<EOS>
You
might
have
cajoled
,
and
fawned
,
and
played
your
traitor
's
part
,
a
little
longer
,
and
grown
richer
.
<EOS>
You
purchase
your
voluptuous
retirement
dear
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Edith
!
"
<EOS>
he
retorted
,
menacing
her
with
his
hand
.
"
<EOS>
Sit
down!Have
done
with
this
!
<EOS>
What
devil
possesses
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Their
name
is
Legion
,
"
she
replied
,
uprearing
her
proud
form
as
if
she
would
have
crushed
him
;
"
you
and
your
master
have
raised
them
in
a
fruitful
house
,
and
they
shall
tear
you
both
.
<EOS>
False
to
him
,
false
to
his
innocent
child
,
<EOS>
false
every
way
and
everywhere
,
go
forth
and
boast
of
me
,
and
gnash
your
teeth
for
once
to
know
that
you
are
lying
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
stood
before
her
muttering
and
menacing
,
and
scowling
round
as
if
for
something
that
would
help
him
to
conquer
her
;
but
with
the
same
indomitable
spirit
she
opposed
him
,
without
faltering
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
every
vaunt
you
make
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
have
my
triumph
.
<EOS>
I
single
out
in
you
the
meanest
man
<EOS>
I
know
,
the
parasite
and
tool
of
the
proud
tyrant
,
that
his
wound
may
go
the
deeper
and
may
rankle
more
.
<EOS>
Boast
,
and
revenge
me
on
him
!
<EOS>
You
know
how
you
came
here
to
-
night
;
you
know
how
you
stand
cowering
there
;
you
see
yourself
in
colours
quite
as
despicable
,
if
not
as
odious
,
as
those
in
which
I
see
you
.
<EOS>
Boast
then
,
and
revenge
me
on
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
foam
was
on
his
lips
;
the
wet
stood
on
his
forehead
.
<EOS>
If
she
would
have
faltered
once
for
only
one
half
-
moment
,
he
would
have
pinioned
her
;
but
she
was
as
firm
as
rock
,
and
her
searching
eyes
never
left
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't
part
so
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
I
am
drivelling
,
to
let
you
go
in
you
<EOS>
mad
temper
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
,
"
she
answered
,
"
that
I
am
to
be
stayed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
try
,
my
dear
,
"
he
said
with
a
ferocious
gesture
of
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
's
mercy
on
you
,
if
you
try
by
coming
near
me
!
<EOS>
she
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
,
"
he
said
,
"
if
there
are
none
of
these
same
boasts
and
vaunts
on
my
part
?
<EOS>
What
if
I
were
to
turn
too
?
<EOS>
Come
!
"
<EOS>
and
his
teeth
fairly
shone
again
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
make
a
treaty
of
this
,
or
I
may
take
some
unexpected
course
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
,
sit
down
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Too
late
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
sparkle
fire
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
thrown
my
fame
and
good
name
to
the
winds
!
<EOS>
I
have
resolved
to
bear
the
shame
that
will
attach
to
me
---
resolved
to
know
that
it
attaches
falsely
---
that
you
know
it
too
---
and
that
he
does
not
,
never
can
,
and
never
shall
.
<EOS>
I
'll
die
,
and
make
no
sign
.
<EOS>
For
this
I
am
here
alone
with
you
,
at
the
dead
of
night
.
<EOS>
For
this
I
have
met
you
here
,
in
a
false
name
,
as
your
wife
.
<EOS>
For
this
,
I
have
been
seen
here
by
those
men
,
and
left
here
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
save
you
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
would
have
sold
his
soul
to
root
her
,
in
her
beauty
,
to
the
floor
,
and
make
her
arms
drop
at
her
sides
,
and
have
her
at
his
mercy
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
look
at
her
,
and
not
be
afraid
of
her
.
<EOS>
He
saw
a
strength
within
her
that
was
resistless
.
<EOS>
He
saw
that
she
was
desperate
,
and
that
her
unquenchable
hatred
of
him
would
stop
at
nothing
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
followed
the
hand
that
was
put
with
such
rugged
uncongenial
purpose
into
her
white
bosom
,
and
he
thought
that
if
it
struck
at
him
,
and
failed
,
it
would
strike
there
,
just
as
soon
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
venture
,
therefore
,
to
advance
towards
her
:
but
the
door
by
which
he
had
entered
was
behind
him
,
and
he
stepped
back
to
lock
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lastly
,
take
my
warning
!
<EOS>
Look
to
yourself
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
and
smiled
again
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
betrayed
,
as
all
betrayers
are
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
made
known
that
you
are
in
this
place
,
or
were
to
be
,
or
have
been
.
<EOS>
If
I
live
,
I
saw
my
husband
in
a
carriage
in
the
street
to
-
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Strumpet
,
it
's
false
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Carker
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
moment
,
the
bell
rang
loudly
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
He
turned
white
,
as
she
held
her
hand
up
like
an
enchantress
,
at
whose
invocation
the
sound
had
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
<EOS>
do
you
hear
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
set
his
back
against
the
door
;
for
he
saw
a
change
in
her
,
and
fancied
she
was
coming
on
to
pass
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
a
moment
,
she
was
gone
through
the
opposite
doors
communicating
with
the
bed
-
chamber
,
and
they
shut
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
Once
turned
,
once
changed
in
her
inflexible
unyielding
look
,
he
felt
that
he
could
cope
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
thought
a
sudden
terror
,
occasioned
by
this
night
-
alarm
,
had
subdued
her
;
not
the
less
readily
,
for
her
overwrought
condition
.
<EOS>
Throwing
open
the
doors
,
he
followed
,
almost
instantly
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
room
was
dark
;
and
as
she
made
no
answer
to
his
call
,
he
was
fain
to
go
back
for
the
lamp
.
<EOS>
He
held
it
up
,
and
looked
round
everywhere
,
expecting
to
see
her
crouching
in
some
corner
;
but
the
room
was
empty
.
<EOS>
So
,
into
the
drawing
-
room
and
dining
-
room
he
went
,
in
succession
,
with
the
uncertain
steps
of
a
man
in
a
strange
place
;
looking
fearfully
about
,
and
prying
behind
screens
and
couches
;
but
she
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
No
,
nor
in
the
hall
,
which
was
so
bare
that
he
could
see
that
,
at
a
glance
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
the
ringing
at
the
bell
was
constantly
renewed
;
and
those
without
were
beating
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
put
his
lamp
down
at
a
distance
,
and
going
near
it
,
listened
.
<EOS>
There
were
several
voices
talking
together
:
at
least
two
of
them
in
English
;
and
though
the
door
was
thick
,
and
there
was
great
confusion
,
he
knew
one
of
these
too
well
to
doubt
whose
voice
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
up
his
lamp
again
,
and
came
back
quickly
through
all
the
rooms
,
stopping
as
he
quitted
each
,
and
looking
round
for
her
,
with
the
light
raised
above
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
was
standing
thus
in
the
bed
-
chamber
,
when
the
door
,
leading
to
the
little
passage
in
the
wall
,
caught
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
went
to
it
,
and
found
it
fastened
on
the
other
side
;
but
she
had
dropped
a
veil
in
going
through
,
and
shut
it
in
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
the
people
on
the
stairs
were
ringing
at
the
bell
,
and
knocking
with
their
hands
and
feet
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
coward
:
but
these
sounds
;
what
had
gone
before
;
the
strangeness
of
the
place
,
which
had
confused
him
,
even
in
his
return
from
the
hall
;
the
frustration
of
his
schemes
(
for
,
strange
to
say
,
he
would
have
been
much
bolder
,
if
they
had
succeeded
)
;
the
unseasonable
time
;
the
recollection
of
having
no
one
near
to
whom
he
could
appeal
for
any
friendly
office
;
above
all
,
the
sudden
sense
,
which
made
even
his
heart
beat
like
lead
,
that
the
man
whose
confidence
he
had
outraged
,
and
whom
he
had
so
treacherously
deceived
,
was
there
to
recognise
and
challenge
him
with
his
mask
plucked
off
his
face
;
struck
a
panic
through
him
.
<EOS>
He
tried
the
door
in
which
the
veil
was
shut
,
but
could
n't
force
it
.
<EOS>
He
opened
one
of
the
windows
,
and
looked
down
through
the
lattice
of
the
blind
,
into
the
court
-
yard
;
but
it
was
a
high
leap
,
and
the
stones
were
pitiless
.
  
<EOS>
The
ringing
and
knocking
still
continuing
---
his
panic
too
---
he
went
back
to
the
door
in
the
bed
-
chamber
,
and
with
some
new
efforts
,
each
more
stubborn
than
the
last
,
wrenched
it
open
.
<EOS>
Seeing
the
little
staircase
not
far
off
,
and
feeling
the
night
-
air
coming
up
,
he
stole
back
for
his
hat
and
coat
,
made
the
door
as
secure
after
him
as
he
could
,
crept
down
lamp
in
hand
,
extinguished
it
on
seeing
the
street
,
and
having
put
it
in
a
corner
,
went
out
where
the
stars
were
shining
.

Rob

loses
his
Place
 
<EOS>
THE
porter
at
the
iron
gate
which
shut
the
court
-
yard
from
the
street
,
had
left
the
little
wicket
of
his
house
open
,
and
was
gone
away
;
no
doubt
to
mingle
in
the
distant
noise
at
the
door
of
the
great
staircase
.
<EOS>
Lifting
the
latch
softly
,
Carker
crept
out
,
and
shutting
the
jangling
gate
after
him
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
,
hurried
off
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
fever
of
his
mortification
and
unavailing
rage
,
the
panic
that
had
seized
upon
him
mastered
him
completely
.
<EOS>
It
rose
to
such
a
height
that
he
would
have
blindly
encountered
almost
any
risk
,
rather
than
meet
the
man
of
whom
,
two
hours
ago
,
he
had
been
utterly
regardless
.
<EOS>
His
fierce
arrival
,
which
he
had
never
expected
;
the
sound
of
his
voice
;
their
having
been
so
near
a
meeting
,
face
to
face
,
he
would
have
braved
out
this
,
after
the
first
momentary
shock
of
alarm
,
and
would
have
put
as
bold
a
front
upon
his
guilt
as
any
villain
.
<EOS>
But
the
springing
of
his
mine
upon
himself
,
seemed
to
have
rent
and
shivered
all
his
hardihood
and
self
-
reliance
.
<EOS>
Spurned
like
any
reptile
;
entrapped
and
mocked
;
turned
upon
,
and
trodden
down
by
the
proud
woman
whose
mind
he
had
slowly
poisoned
,
as
he
thought
,
until
she
had
sunk
into
the
mere
creature
of
his
pleasure
;
undeceived
in
his
deceit
,
and
with
his
fox
's
hide
stripped
off
,
he
sneaked
away
,
abashed
,
degraded
,
and
afraid
.
  
<EOS>
Some
other
terror
came
upon
him
quite
removed
from
this
of
being
pursued
,
suddenly
,
like
an
electric
shock
,
as
he
was
creeping
through
the
streets
.
<EOS>
Some
visionary
terror
,
unintelligible
and
inexplicable
,
associated
with
a
trembling
of
the
ground
,
---
a
rush
and
sweep
of
something
through
the
air
,
like
Death
upon
the
wing
.
<EOS>
He
shrunk
,
as
if
to
let
the
thing
go
by
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
gone
,
it
never
had
been
there
,
yet
what
a
startling
horror
it
had
left
behind
.
  
<EOS>
He
raised
his
wicked
face
,
so
full
of
trouble
,
to
the
night
sky
,
where
the
stars
,
so
full
of
peace
,
were
shining
on
him
as
they
had
been
when
he
first
stole
out
into
the
air
;
and
stopped
to
think
what
he
should
do
.
<EOS>
The
dread
of
being
hunted
in
a
strange
remote
place
,
where
the
laws
might
not
protect
him
---
the
novelty
of
the
feeling
that
it
was
strange
and
remote
,
originating
in
his
being
left
alone
so
suddenly
amid
the
ruins
of
his
plans
---
his
greater
dread
of
seeking
refuge
now
,
in
Italy
or
in
Sicily
,
where
men
might
be
hired
to
assassinate
him
,
he
thought
,
at
any
dark
street
corner
---
the
waywardness
of
guilt
and
fear
---
perhaps
some
sympathy
of
action
with
the
turning
back
of
all
his
schemes
---
impelled
him
to
turn
back
too
,
and
go
to
England
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
safer
there
,
in
any
case
.
<EOS>
If
I
should
not
decide
,
"
he
thought
,
"
to
give
this
fool
a
meeting
,
I
am
less
likely
to
be
traced
there
,
than
abroad
here
,
now
.
<EOS>
And
if
I
should
(
this
cursed
fit
being
over
)
,
at
least
I
shall
not
be
alone
,
without
a
soul
to
speak
to
,
or
advise
with
,
or
stand
by
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
run
in
upon
and
worried
like
a
rat
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
muttered
Edith
's
name
,
and
clenched
his
hand
.
<EOS>
As
he
crept
along
,
in
the
shadow
of
the
massive
buildings
,
he
set
his
teeth
,
and
muttered
dreadful
imprecations
on
her
head
,
and
looked
from
side
to
side
,
as
if
in
search
of
her
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
he
stole
on
to
the
gate
of
an
inn
-
yard
.
<EOS>
The
people
were
a
-
bed
;
but
his
ringing
at
the
bell
soon
produced
a
man
with
a
lantern
,
in
company
with
whom
he
was
presently
in
a
dim
coach
-
house
,
bargaining
for
the
hire
of
an
old
phaeton
,
to
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
The
bargain
was
a
short
one
;
and
the
horses
were
soon
sent
for
.
<EOS>
Leaving
word
that
the
carriage
was
to
follow
him
when
they
came
,
he
stole
away
again
,
beyond
the
town
,
past
the
old
ramparts
,
out
on
the
open
road
,
which
seemed
to
glide
away
along
the
dark
plain
,
like
a
stream
.
  
<EOS>
Whither
did
it
flow
?
<EOS>
What
was
the
end
of
it
?
<EOS>
As
he
paused
,
with
some
such
suggestion
within
him
,
looking
over
the
gloomy
flat
where
the
slender
trees
marked
out
the
way
,
again
that
flight
of
Death
came
rushing
up
,
again
went
on
,
impetuous
and
resistless
,
again
was
nothing
but
a
horror
in
his
mind
,
dark
as
the
scene
and
undefined
as
its
remotest
verge
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
wind
;
there
was
no
passing
shadow
on
the
deep
shade
of
the
night
;
there
was
no
noise
.
<EOS>
The
city
lay
behind
him
,
lighted
here
and
there
,
and
starry
worlds
were
hidden
by
the
masonry
of
spire
and
roof
that
hardly
made
out
any
shapes
against
the
sky
.
<EOS>
Dark
and
lonely
distance
lay
around
him
everywhere
,
and
the
clocks
were
faintly
striking
two
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
forward
for
what
appeared
a
long
time
,
and
a
long
way
;
often
stopping
to
listen
.
<EOS>
At
last
the
ringing
of
horses
'
bells
greeted
his
anxious
ears
.
<EOS>
Now
softer
,
and
now
louder
,
now
inaudible
,
now
ringing
very
slowly
over
bad
ground
,
now
brisk
and
merry
,
it
came
on
;
until
with
a
loud
shouting
and
lashing
,
a
shadowy
postillion
muffled
to
the
eyes
,
checked
his
four
struggling
horses
at
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
goes
there
!
<EOS>
Monsieur
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur

walked
a
long
way
in
the
dark
midnight
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No

<EOS>
Every
one
to
his
taste

<EOS>
Were
there
any
other
horses
ordered
at
the
Post

Away
,
at

,
over
the
black
landscape
,
scattering
the
dust
and
dirt
like
spray
!
  
<EOS>
The
clatter
and
commotion
echoed
to
the
hurry
and
discordance
of
the
fugitive
's
ideas
.
<EOS>
Nothing
clear
without
,
and
nothing
clear
within
.
<EOS>
Objects
flitting
past
,
merging
into
one
another
,
dimly
descried
,
confusedly
lost
sight
of
,
gone!Beyond
the
changing
scraps
of
fence
and
cottage
immediately
upon
the
road
,
a
lowering
waste
.
<EOS>
Beyond
the
shifting
images
that
rose
up
in
his
mind
and
vanished
as
they
showed
themselves
,
a
black
expanse
of
dread
and
rage
and
baffled
villany
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
,
a
sigh
of
mountain
air
came
from
the
distant
Jura
,
fading
along
the
plain
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
that
rush
which
was
so
furious
and
horrible
,
again
came
sweeping
through
his
fancy
,
passed
away
,
and
left
a
chill
upon
his
blood
.
  
<EOS>
The
lamps
,
gleaming
on
the
medley
of
horses
'
heads
,
jumbled
with
the
shadowy
driver
,
and
the
fluttering
of
his
cloak
,
made
a
thousand
indistinct
shapes
,
answering
to
his
thoughts
.
<EOS>
Shadows
of
familiar
people
,
stooping
at
their
desks
and
books
,
in
their
remembered
attitudes
;
strange
apparitions
of
the
man
whom
he
was
flying
from
,
or
of
Edith
;
repetitions
in
the
ringing
bells
and
rolling
wheels
,
of
words
that
had
been
spoken
;
confusions
of
time
and
place
,
making
last
night
a

,
a
month

last

---
home
now
distant
beyond
hope
,
now
instantly
accessible

commotion

discord

hurry

darkness

and
confusion
in

all
around
him

Hallo
!
<EOS>
Hi
!
<EOS>
away
at
a
gallop
over
the
black
landscape
;
dust
and
dirt
flying
like
spray
,
the
smoking
horses
snorting
and
plunging
as
if
each
of
them
were
ridden
by
a
demon
,
away
in
a
frantic
triumph
on
the
dark
road
---
whither
?
  
<EOS>
Again
the
nameless
shock
comes
speeding
up
,
and
as
it
passes
,
the
bells
ring
in
his
ears
"
whither
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
wheels
roar
in
his
ears
"
whither
?
"
<EOS>
All
the
noise
and
rattle
shapes
itself
into
that
cry
.
<EOS>
The
lights
and
shadows
dance
upon
the
horses
'
heads
like
imps
.
<EOS>
No
stopping
now
<EOS>
:
no
slackening
!
<EOS>
On
,
on
!
<EOS>
Away
with
him
upon
the
dark
road
wildly
!
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
think
to
any
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
separate
one
subject
of
reflection
from
another
,
sufficiently
to
dwell
upon
it
,
by
itself
,
for
a
minute
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
The
crash
of
his
project
for
the
gaining
of
a
voluptuous
compensation
for
past
restraint
;
the
overthrow
of
his
treachery
to
one
who
had
been
true
and
generous
to
him
,
but
whose
least
proud
word
and
look
he
had
treasured
up
,
at
interest
,
for
years
---
for
false
and
subtle
men
will
always
secretly
despise
and
dislike
the
object
upon
which
they
fawn
,
and
always
resent
the
payment
and
receipt
of
homage
that
they
know
to
be
worthless
;
these
were
the
themes
uppermost
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
A
lurking
rage
against
the
woman
who
had
so
entrapped
him
and
avenged
herself
was
always
there
;
crude
and
misshapen
schemes
of
retaliation
upon
her
,
floated
in
his
brain
;
but
nothing
was
distinct
.
<EOS>
A
hurry
and
contradiction
pervaded
all
his
thoughts
.
<EOS>
Even
while
he
was
so
busy
with
this
fevered
,
ineffectual
thinking
,
his
one
constant
idea
was
,
that
he
would
postpone
reflection
until
some
indefinite
time
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
the
old
days
before
the
second
marriage
rose
up
in
his
remembrance
.
<EOS>
He
thought
how
jealous
he
had
been
of
the
boy
,
how
jealous
he
had
been
of
the
girl
,
how
artfully
he
had
kept
intruders
at
a
distance
,
and
drawn
a
circle
round
his
dupe
that
none
but
himself
should
cross
;
and
then
he
thought
,
had
he
done
all
this
to
be
flying
now
,
like
a
scared
thief
,
from
only
the
poor
dupe
?
  
<EOS>
He
could
have
laid
hands
upon
himself
for
his
cowardice
,
but
it
was
the
very
shadow
of
his
defeat
,
and
could
not
be
separated
from
it
.
<EOS>
To
have
his
confidence
in
his
own
knavery
so
shattered
at
a
blow
---
to
be
within
his
own
knowledge
such
a
miserable
tool
---
was
like
being
paralysed
.
<EOS>
With
an
impotent
ferocity
he
raged
at
Edith
,
and
hated
Mr
Dombey
and
hated
himself
,
but
still
he
fled
,
and
could
do
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
Again
and
again
he
listened
for
the
sound
of
wheels
behind
.
<EOS>
Again
and
again
his
fancy
heard
it
,
coming
on
louder
and
louder
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
was
so
persuaded
of
this
,
that
he
cried
out
,
"
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
preferring
even
the
loss
of
ground
to
such
uncertainty
.
  
<EOS>
The
word
soon
brought
carriage
,
horses
,
driver
,
all
in
a
heap
together
,
across
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
devil
!
"
cried
the
driver
,
looking
over
his
shoulder
,
"
what
's
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
<EOS>
What
's
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
noise
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
Heaven
,
be
quiet
,
cursed
brigand
!
"
to
a
horse
who
shook
his
bells
.
<EOS>
"
What
noise
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Behind
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
another
carriage
at
a
gallop
?
<EOS>
There!what
's
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miscreant
with
a
pig
's
head
,
stand
still
!
"
<EOS>
to
another
horse
,
who
bit
another
,
who
frightened
the
other
two
,
who
plunged
and
backed
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
coming
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
nothing
but
the
day
yonder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
I
hear
nothing
now
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Go
on
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
entangled
equipage
,
half
hidden
in
the
reeking
cloud
from
the
horses
,
goes
on
slowly
at
first
,
for
the
driver
,
checked
unnecessarily
in
his
progress
,
sulkily
takes
out
a
pocket
-
knife
,
and
puts
a
new
lash
to
his
whip
.
<EOS>
Then
"
Hallo
,
whoop
!
<EOS>
Hallo
,
hi
!
"
<EOS>
Away
once
more
,
savagely
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
the
stars
faded
,
and
<EOS>
the
day
glimmered
,
and
standing
in
the
carriage
,
looking
back
,
he
could
discern
the
track
by
which
he
had
come
,
and
see
that
there
was
no
traveller
within
view
,
on
all
the
heavy
expanse
.
<EOS>
And
soon
it
was
broad
day
,
and
the
sun
began
to
shine
on
cornfields
and
vineyards
;
and
solitary
labourers
,
risen
from
little
temporary
huts
by
heaps
of
stones
upon
the
road
,
were
,
here
and
there
,
at
work
repairing
the
highway
,
or
eating
bread
.
<EOS>
By
and
by
,
there
were
peasants
going
to
their
daily
labour
,
or
to
market
,
or
lounging
at
the
doors
of
poor
cottages
,
gazing
idly
at
him
as
he
passed
.
<EOS>
An
then
there
was
a
postyard
,
ankle
-
deep
in
mud
,
with
steaming
dunghills
and
vast
outhouses
half
ruined
;
and
looking
on
this
dainty
prospect
,
an
immense
,
old
shadeless
,
glaring
,
stone
chateau
,
with
half
its
windows
blinded
,
and
green
damp
crawling
lazily
over
it
,
from
the
balustraded
terrace
to
the
taper
tips
of
the
extinguishers
upon
the
turrets
.
  
<EOS>
Gathered
up
moodily
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
,
and
only
intent
on
going
fast
---
except
when
he
stood
up
,
for
a
mile
together
,
and
looked
back
;
which
he
would
do
whenever
there
was
a
piece
of
open
country
---
he
went
on
,
still
postponing
thought
indefinitely
,
and
still
always
tormented
with
thinking
to
no
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
Shame
,
disappointment
,
and
discomfiture
gnawed
at
his
heart
;
a
constant
apprehension
of
being
overtaken
,
or
met
---
for
he
was
groundlessly
afraid
even
of
travellers
,
who
came
towards
him
by
the
way
he
was
going
---
oppressed
him
heavily
.
<EOS>
The
same
intolerable
awe
and
dread
that
had
come
upon
his
in
the
night
,
returned
unweakened
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
The
monotonous
ringing
of
the
bells
and
tramping
of
the
horses
;
the
monotony
of
his
anxiety
,
and
useless
rage
;
the
monotonous
wheel
of
fear
,
regret
,
and
passion
,
he
kept
turning
round
and
round
;
made
the
journey
like
a
vision
,
in
which
nothing
was
quite
real
but
his
own
torment
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
vision
of
long
roads
;
that
stretched
away
to
an
horizon
,
always
receding
and
never
gained
;
of
ill
-
paved
towns
,
up
hill
and
down
,
where
faces
came
to
dark
doors
and
ill
-
glazed
windows
,
and
where
rows
of
mud
-
bespattered
cows
and
oxen
were
tied
up
for
sale
in
the
long
narrow
streets
,
butting
and
lowing
,
and
receiving
blows
on
their
blunt
heads
from
bludgeons
that
might
have
beaten
them
in
;
of
bridges
,
crosses
,
churches
,
postyards
,
new
horses
being
put
in
against
their
wills
,
and
the
horses
of
the
last
stage
reeking
,
panting
,
and
laying
their
drooping
heads
together
dolefully
at
stable
doors
;
of
little
cemeteries
with
black
crosses
settled
sideways
in
the
graves
,
and
withered
wreaths
upon
them
dropping
away
;
again
of
long
,
long
roads
,
dragging
themselves
out
,
up
hill
and
down
,
to
the
treacherous
horizon
.
  
<EOS>
Of
morning
,
noon
,
and
sunset
;
night
,
and
the
rising
of
an
early
moon
.
<EOS>
Of
long
roads
temporarily
left
behind
,
and
a
rough
pavement
reached
;
of
battering
and
clattering
over
it
,
and
looking
up
,
among
house
-
roofs
,
at
a
great
church
-
tower
;
of
getting
out
and
eating
hastily
,
and
drinking
draughts
of
wine
that
had
no
cheering
influence
;
of
coming
forth
afoot
,
among
a
host
of
beggars
---
blind
men
with
quivering
eyelids
,
led
by
old
women
holding
candles
to
their
faces
;
idiot
girls
;
the
lame
,
the
epileptic
,
and
the
palsied
---
of
passing
through
the
clamour
,
and
looking
from
his
seat
at
the
upturned
countenances
and
outstretched
hands
,
with
a
hurried
dread
of
recognising
some
pursuer
pressing
forward
---
of
galloping
away
again
,
upon
the
long
,
long
road
,
gathered
up
,
dull
and
stunned
,
in
his
corner
,
or
rising
to
see
where
the
moon
shone
faintly
on
a
patch
of
the
same
endless
road
miles
away
,
or
looking
back
to
see
who
followed
.
  
<EOS>
Of
never
sleeping
,
but
sometimes
dozing
with
unclosed
eyes
,
and
springing
up
with
a
start
,
and
a
reply
aloud
to
an
imaginary
voice
.
<EOS>
Of
cursing
himself
for
being
there
,
for
having
fled
,
for
having
let
her
go
,
for
not
having
confronted
and
defied
him
.
<EOS>
Of
having
a
deadly
quarrel
with
the
whole
world
,
but
chiefly
with
himself
.
<EOS>
Of
blighting
everything
with
his
black
mood
as
he
was
carried
on
and
away
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
fevered
vision
of
things
past
and
present
<EOS>
all
confounded
together
;
of
his
life
and
journey
blended
into
one
.
<EOS>
Of
being
madly
hurried
somewhere
,
whither
he
must
go
.
<EOS>
Of
old
scenes
starting
up
among
the
novelties
through
which
he
travelled
.
<EOS>
Of
musing
and
brooding
over
what
was
past
and
distant
,
and
seeming
to
take
no
notice
of
the
actual
objects
he
encountered
,
but
with
a
wearisome
exhausting
consciousness
of
being
bewildered
by
them
,
and
having
their
images
all
crowded
in
his
hot
brain
after
they
were
gone
.
  
<EOS>
A
vision
of
change
upon
change
,
and
still
the
same
monotony
of
bells
and
wheels
,
and
horses
'
feet
,
and
no
rest
.
<EOS>
Of
town
and
country
,
postyards
,
horses

,
hill

valley
,
light
and
darkness
,
road
and
pavement

wet

dry

and
still
the
same
monotony
of
bells

wheels

horses
'
feet
,
and
no
rest

<EOS>
A
vision
of
tending
on
at
last
,
towards
the
distant
capital
,
by
busier
roads
,
and
sweeping
round
,
by
old
cathedrals
,
and
dashing
through
small
towns
and
villages
,
less
thinly
scattered
on
the
road
than
formerly
,
and
sitting
shrouded
in
his
corner
,
with
his
cloak
up
to
his
face
,
as
people
passing
by
looked
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
Of
rolling
on
and
on
,
always
postponing
thought
,
and
always
racked
with
thinking
;
of
being
unable
to
reckon
up
the
hours
he
had
been
upon
the
road
,
or
to
comprehend
the
points
of
time
and
place
in
his
journey
.
<EOS>
Of
being
parched
and
giddy
,
and
half
mad
.
<EOS>
Of
pressing
on
,
in
spite
of
all
,
as
if
he
could
not
stop
,
and
coming
into
Paris
,
where
the
turbid
river
held
its
swift
course
undisturbed
,
between
two
brawling
streams
of
life
and
motion
.
  
<EOS>
A
troubled
vision
,
then
,
of
bridges

quays

interminable
streets
;
of
wine

,
water
-
carriers
,
great
crowds
of

military

<EOS>
Of
the
monotony
of
bells

wheels
and
horses
'
feet
being
at
length
lost
in
the
universal
din
and
uproar
.
<EOS>
Of
the
gradual
subsidence
of
that
noise
as
he
passed
out
in
another
carriage
by
a
different
barrier
from
that
by
which
he
had
entered
.
<EOS>
Of
the
restoration

travelled
on

of
the
monotony

bells

Of
sunset
once

Of

dead

feeble

Of

Of
toiling

up

the
fresh
sea

seeing
the
morning
light
upon

Of
coming
down
into

Of

,
and
the
universal
sparkling
.
  
<EOS>
Of
receding
from
the
coast
,
and
looking
back
upon
it
from
the
deck
when
it
was
a
haze
upon
the
water
,
with
here
<EOS>
and
there
a
little
opening
of
bright
land
where
the
Sun
struck
.
<EOS>
Of
the
swell
,
and
flash
,
and
murmur
of
the
calm
sea
.
<EOS>
Of
another
grey
line
on
the
ocean
,
on
the
vessel
's
track
,
fast
growing
clearer
and
higher
.
<EOS>
Of
cliffs
and
buildings
,
and
a
windmill
,
and
a
church
,
becoming
more
and
more
visible
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Of
steaming
on
at
last
into
smooth
water
,
and
mooring
to
a
pier
whence
groups
of
people
looked
down
,
greeting
friends
on
board
.
<EOS>
Of
disembarking
,
passing
among
them
quickly
,
shunning
every
one
;
and
of
being
at
last
again
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
thought
,
in
his
dream
,
of
going
down
into
a
remote
country
-
place
he
knew
,
and
lying
quiet
there
,
while
he
secretly
informed
himself
of
what
transpired
,
and
determined
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
Still
in
the
same
stunned
condition
,
he
remembered
a
certain
station
on
the
railway
,
where
he
would
have
to
branch
off
to
his
place
of
destination
,
and
where
there
was
a
quiet
Inn
.
<EOS>
Here
,
he
indistinctly
resolved
to
tarry
and
rest
.
  
<EOS>
With
this
purpose
he
slunk
into
a
railway
carriage
as
quickly
as
he
could
,
and
lying
there
wrapped
in
his
cloak
as
if
he
were
asleep
,
was
soon
borne
far
away
from
the
sea
,
and
deep
into
the
inland
green
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
his
destination
he
looked
out
,
and
surveyed
it
carefully
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
mistaken
in
his
impression
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
retired
spot
,
on
the
borders
of
a
little
wood
.
<EOS>
Only
one
house
,
newly
-
built
or
altered
for
the
purpose
,
stood
there
,
<EOS>
surrounded
by
its
neat
garden
;
the
small
town
that
was
nearest
,
was
some
miles
away
.
<EOS>
Here
he
alighted
then
;
and
going
straight
into
the
tavern
,
unobserved
by
any
one
,
secured
two
rooms
upstairs
communicating
with
each
other
,
sufficiently
retired
.
  
<EOS>
His
object
was
to
rest
,
and
recover
the
command
of
himself
,
and
the
balance
of
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Imbecile
discomfiture
and
rage
---
<EOS>
so
that
,
as
he
walked
about
his
room
,
he
ground
his
teeth
---
had
complete
possession
of
him
.
<EOS>
His
thoughts
,
not
to
be
stopped
or
directed
,
still
wandered
where
they
would
,
and
dragged
him
after
them
.
<EOS>
He
was
stupefied
,
and
he
was
wearied
to
death
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
as
if
there
were
a
curse
upon
him
that
he
should
never
rest
again
,
his
drowsy
senses
would
not
lose
their
consciousness
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
more
influence
with
them
in
this
regard
,
than
if
they
had
been
another
man
's
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
they
forced
him
to
take
note
of
present
sounds
and
objects
,
but
that
they
would
not
be
diverted
from
the
whole
hurried
vision
of
his
journey
.
<EOS>
It
was
constantly
before
him
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
stood
there
,
with
her
dark
disdainful
eyes
again
upon
him
;
and
he
was
riding
on
nevertheless
,
through
town
and
country
,
light
and
darkness
,
wet
weather
and
dry
,
over
road
and
pavement
,
hill
and
valley
,
height
and
hollow
,
jaded
and
scared
by
the
monotony
of
bells
and
wheels
,
and
horses
'
feet
,
and
no
rest
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
day
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
of
the
waiter
,
who
was
making
preparations
for
his
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Day
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
Wednesday
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wednesday
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
No
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Thursday
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
forgot
.
<EOS>
How
goes
the
time
?
<EOS>
My
watch
is
unwound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wants
a
few
minutes
of
five
o'clock
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Been
travelling
a
long
time
,
Sir
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
"
By
rail
,
Sir
?
"
  
"
Yes
.
"
  
"
Very
confusing
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Not
much
in
the
habit
of
travelling
by
rail
myself
,
Sir
,
<EOS>
but
gentlemen
frequently
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
many
gentlemen
come
here
?
"
  
"
Pretty
well
,
Sir
,
in
general
.
<EOS>
Nobody
here
at
present
.
<EOS>
Rather
slack
just
now
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Everything
is
slack
,
Sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
made
no
answer
;
but
had
risen
into
a
sitting
posture
on
the
sofa
where
he
had
been
lying
,
and
leaned
forward
with
an
arm
on
each
knee
,
staring
at
the
ground
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
master
his
own
attention
for
a
minute
together
.
<EOS>
It
rushed
away
where
it
would
,
but
it
never
,
for
an
instant
,
lost
itself
in
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
He
drank
a
quantity
of
wine
after
dinner
,
in
vain
.
<EOS>
No
such
artificial
means
would
bring
sleep
to
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
His
thoughts
,
more
incoherent
,
dragged
him
more
unmercifully
after
them
---
as
if
a
wretch
,
condemned
to
such
expiation
,
were
drawn
at
the
heels
of
wild
horses
.
<EOS>
No
oblivion
,
and
no
rest
.
  
<EOS>
How
long
he
sat
,
drinking
and
brooding
,
and
being
dragged
in
imagination
hither
and
thither
,
no
one
could
have
told
less
correctly
than
he
.
<EOS>
But
he
knew
that
he
had
been
sitting
a
long
time
by
candle
-
light
,
when
he
started
up
and
listened
,
in
a
sudden
terror
.
  
<EOS>
For
now
,
indeed
,
it
was
no
fancy
.
<EOS>
The
ground
shook
,
the
house
rattled
,
the
fierce
impetuous
rush
was
in
the
air
!
<EOS>
He
felt
it
come
up
,
and
go
darting
by
;
and
even
when
he
had
hurried
to
the
window
,
and
saw
what
it
was
,
he
stood
,
shrinking
from
it
,
as
if
it
were
not
safe
to
look
.
  
<EOS>
A
curse
upon
the
fiery
devil
,
thundering
along
so
smoothly
,
tracked
through
the
distant
valley
by
a
glare
of
light
and
lurid
smoke
,
and
gone
!
<EOS>
He
felt
as
if
he
had
been
plucked
out
of
its
path
,
and
saved
from
being
torn
asunder
.
<EOS>
It
made
him
shrink
and
shudder
even
now
,
when
its
faintest
hum
was
hushed
,
and
when
the
lines
of
iron
road
he
could
trace
in
the
moonlight
,
running
to
a
point
,
were
as
empty
and
as
silent
as
a
desert
.
  
<EOS>
Unable
to
rest
,
and
irresistibly
attracted
<EOS>
---
or
he
thought
so
---
to
this
road
,
he
went
out
and
lounged
on
the
brink
of
it
,
marking
the
way
the
train
had
gone
,
by
the
yet
smoking
cinders
that
were
lying
in
its
track
.
<EOS>
After
a
lounge
of
some
half
hour
in
the
direction
by
which
it
had
disappeared
,
he
turned
and
walked
the
other
way
---
still
keeping
to
the
brink
of
the
road
---
past
the
inn
garden
,
and
a
long
way
down
;
looking
curiously
at
the
bridges
,
signals
,
lamps
,
and
wondering
when
another
Devil
would
come
by
.
  
<EOS>
A
trembling
of
the
ground
,
and
quick
vibration
in
his
ears
;
a
distant
shriek
;
a
dull
light
advancing
,
quickly
changed
to
two
red
eyes
,
and
a
fierce
fire
,
dropping
glowing
coals
;
an
irresistible
bearing
on
of
a
great
roaring
and
dilating
mass
;
a
high
wind
,
and
a
rattle
---
another
come
and
gone
,
and
he
holding
to
a
gate
,
as
if
to
save
himself
!
  
<EOS>
He
waited
for
another
,
and
for
another
.
<EOS>
He
walked
back
to
his
former
point
,
and
back
again
to
that
,
and
still
,
through
the
wearisome
vision
of
his
journey
,
looked
for
these
approaching
monsters
.
<EOS>
He
loitered
about
the
station
,
waiting
until
one
should
stay
to
call
there
;
and
when
one
did
,
and
was
detached
for
water
,
he
stood
parallel
with
it
,
watching
its
heavy
wheels
and
brazen
front
,
and
thinking
what
a
cruel
power
and
might
it
had
.
<EOS>
Ugh
!
<EOS>
To
see
the
great
wheels
slowly
turning
,
and
to
think
of
being
run
down
and
crushed
!
  
<EOS>
Disordered
with
wine
and
want
of
rest
<EOS>
---
that
want
which
nothing
,
although
he
was
so
weary
,
would
appease
---
<EOS>
these
ideas
and
objects
assumed
a
diseased
importance
in
his
thoughts
.
<EOS>
When
he
went
back
to
his
room
,
which
was
not
until
near
midnight
,
they
still
haunted
him
,
and
he
sat
listening
for
the
coming
of
another
.
  
<EOS>
So
in
his
bed
,
whither
he
repaired
with
no
hope
of
sleep
.
<EOS>
He
still
lay
listening
;
and
when
he
felt
the
trembling
and
vibration
,
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
,
to
watch
(
as
he
could
from
its
position
)
the
dull
light
changing
to
the
two
red
eyes
,
and
the
fierce
fire
dropping
glowing
coals
,
and
the
rush
of
the
giant
as
it
fled
past
,
and
the
track
of
glare
and
smoke
along
the
valley
.
<EOS>
Then
he
would
glance
in
the
direction
by
which
he
intended
to
depart
at
sunrise
,
as
there
was
no
rest
for
him
there
;
and
would
lie
down
again
,
to
be
troubled
by
the
vision
of
his
journey
,
and
the
old
monotony
of
bells
and
wheels
and
horses
'
feet
,
until
another
came
.
<EOS>
This
lasted
all
night
.
<EOS>
So
far
from
resuming
the
mastery
of
himself
,
he
seemed
,
if
possible
,
to
lose
it
more
and
more
,
as
the
night
crept
on
.
<EOS>
When
the
dawn
appeared
,
he
was
still
tormented
with
thinking
,
still
postponing
thought
until
he
should
be
in
a
better
state
;
the
past
,
present
,
and
future
,
all
floated
confusedly
before
him
,
and
he
had
lost
all
power
of
looking
steadily
at
any
one
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
what
time
,
"
he
asked
the
man
who
had
waited
on
him
over
-
night
,
now
entering
with
a
candle
,
"
do
I
leave
here
,
did
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
About
a
quarter
after
four
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Express
comes
through
at
four
,
Sir
.
---
<EOS>
It
do
n't
stop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
passed
his
hand
across
his
throbbing
head
,
and
looked
at
his
watch
.
<EOS>
Nearly
half
-
past
three
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
going
with
you
,
Sir
,
probably
,
"
observed
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Two
gentlemen
here
,
Sir
,
but
they
're
waiting
for
the
train
to
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
said
there
was
nobody
here
,
"
said
Carker
,
turning
upon
him
with
the
ghost
of
his
old
smile
,
when
he
was
angry
or
suspicious
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
then
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Two
gentlemen
came
in
the
night
by
the
short
train
that
stops
here
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Warm
water
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
and
take
away
the
candle
.
<EOS>
There
's
day
enough
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Having
thrown
himself
upon
the
bed
,
half
-
dressed
,
he
was
at
the
window
as
the
man
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
cold
light
of
morning
had
succeeded
to
night
,
and
there
was
already
,
in
the
sky
,
the
red
suffusion
of
the
coming
sun
.
<EOS>
He
bathed
his
head
and
face
with
water
---
there
was
no
cooling
influence
in
it
for
him
---
hurriedly
put
on
his
clothes
,
paid
what
he
owed
,
and
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
The
air
struck
chill
and
comfortless
,
as
it
breathed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
heavy
dew
;
and
,
hot
as
he
was
,
it
made
him
shiver
.
<EOS>
After
a
glance
at
the
place
where
he
had
walked
last
night
,
and
at
the
signal
-
lights
burning
feebly
in
the
morning
,
and
bereft
of
their
significance
,
he
turned
to
where
the
sun
was
rising
,
and
beheld
it
,
in
its
glory
,
as
it
broke
upon
the
scene
.
  
<EOS>
So
awful
,
so
transcendent
in
its
beauty
,
so
divinely
solemn
.
<EOS>
As
he
cast
his
faded
eyes
upon
it
,
where
it
rose
,
tranquil
and
serene
,
unmoved
by
all
the
wrong
and
wickedness
on
which
its
beams
had
shone
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
,
who
shall
say
that
some
weak
sense
of
virtue
upon
Earth
,
and
its
reward
in
Heaven
,
did
not
manifest
itself
,
even
to
him
?
<EOS>
If
ever
he
remembered
sister
or
brother
with
a
touch
of
tenderness
and
remorse
,
who
shall
say
it
was
not
then
?
  
<EOS>
He
needed
some
such
touch
then
.
<EOS>
Death
was
on
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
marked
off
from
the
living
world
,
and
going
down
into
his
grave
.
  
<EOS>
He
paid
the
money
for
his
journey
to
the
country
-
place
he
had
thought
of
;
and
was
walking
to
and
fro
,
alone
,
looking
along
the
lines
of
iron
,
across
the
valley
in
one
direction
,
and
towards
a
dark
bridge
near
at
hand
in
the
other
;
when
,
turning
in
his
walk
,
where
it
was
bounded
by
one
end
of
the
wooden
stage
on
which
he
paced
up
and
down
,
he
saw
the
man
from
whom
he
had
fled
,
emerging
from
the
door
by
which
he
himself
had
entered
there
.
<EOS>
And
their
eyes
met
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
quick
unsteadiness
of
the
surprise
,
he
staggered
,
and
slipped
on
to
the
road
below
him
.
<EOS>
But
recovering
his
feet
immediately
,
he
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
upon
that
road
,
to
interpose
some
wider
space
between
them
,
and
looked
at
his
pursuer
,
breathing
short
and
quick
.
  
<EOS>
He
heard
a
shout
---
another
---
saw
the
face
change
from
its
vindictive
passion
to
a
faint
sickness
and
terror
---
felt
the
earth
tremble
---
knew
in
a
moment
that
the
rush
was
come
---
uttered
a
shriek
---
<EOS>
looked
round
---
saw
the
red
eyes
,
bleared
and
dim
,
in
the
daylight
,
close
upon
him
---
was
beaten
down
,
caught
up
,
and
whirled
away
upon
a
jagged
mill
,
that
spun
him
round
and
round
,
and
struck
him
limb
from
limb
,
and
licked
his
stream
of
life
up
with
its
fiery
heat

cast
his
mutilated
fragments

When
the
traveller
,
who
had
been
recognised
,
recovered
from
a
swoon
,
he
saw
them
bringing
from
a
distance
something
covered
,
that
lay
heavy
and
still
,
upon
a
board
,
between
four
men
,
and
saw
that
others
drove
some
dogs
away
that
sniffed
upon
the
road
,
and
soaked
his
blood
up
,
with
a
train
of
ashes

Several

<EOS>
THE
Midshipman
was
all
alive

<EOS>
Mr
Toots
and
Susan
had
arrived
at
last
.
<EOS>
Susan
has
run
up
stairs
like
a
young
woman
bereft
of
her
senses
,
and
Mr
Toots
and
the
Chicken
had
gone
into
the
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
my
own
pretty
darling
sweet
Miss
Floy
!
"
cried
the
Nipper
,
running
into
Florence
's
room
,
"
to
think
that
it
should
come
to
this
<EOS>
and
I
should
find
you
here
my
own
dear
dove
with
nobody
to
wait
upon
you
and
no
home
to
call
your
own
but
<EOS>
never

will
I
go
away
again
Miss
Floy
for
though
I
may
not
gather
moss
<EOS>
I
'm
not
a

n't
bust
as
it
is
busting
now
<EOS>
oh
dear
<EOS>
oh
dear

"
  
<EOS>
Pouring
out
these
words
,
without
the
faintest
indication
of
a
stop
,
of
any
sort
,
Miss
Nipper
,
on
her
knees
beside
her
mistress
,
hugged
her
close
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
love
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Susan
,
"
I
know
all
that

I

said
Florence

<EOS>
"
Oh

that

going

"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Susan
,
in
a
burst
of
pain
and
pleasure
,
pride
and
grief
,
and
Heaven
knows
how
many
other
conflicting
feelings
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
told
you
so
?
"
said
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
gracious
me

<EOS>
that
innocentest
creetur

"
returned
Susan
hysterically
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
he
must
be
right

my

because
he
took
on
so

<EOS>
He

the
devotedest

innocentest

<EOS>

"
pursued
Susan
,
with
another
close
embrace
and
burst
of
tears
,
"
really
really
going
to
be
married

"
  
<EOS>
The
mixture
of
compassion
,
pleasure
,
tenderness
,
protection
,
and
regret
with
which
the
Nipper
constantly
recurred
to
this
subject
,
and
at
every
such
recurrence
,
raised
her
head
to
look
in
the
young
face
and
kiss
it
,
and
then
laid
her
head
again
upon
her
mistress
's
shoulder
,
caressing
her
and
sobbing
,
was
as
womanly
and
good
a
thing
,
in
its
way
,
as
ever
was
seen
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
"
There

there

"
said
the
soothing
voice
of
Florence
presently
.
<EOS>
"
Now
you
're
quite
yourself
,
dear
Susan

"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Nipper
,
sitting
down
upon
the
floor
,
at
her
mistress
's
feet
,
laughing
and
sobbing
,
holding
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
with
one
hand
,
and
patting
Diogenes
with
the
other
as
he
licked
her
face
,
confessed
to
being
more
composed
,
and
laughed
and
cried
a
little
more
in
proof
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
---
I
never
did
see
such
a

as

said
Susan
,
"
in

<EOS>
"
  
"
So
kind
,
"
suggested
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
so
comic
!
"
<EOS>
Susan
sobbed
.
<EOS>
"
The
way
he
's
been
going
on
inside
with
me
with
that
disrespectable
Chicken
on
the
box

"
  
"
About
what
,
Susan
?
"
inquired
Florence
timidly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
about
Lieutenant
Walters
,
and
Captain
Gills
,

you

dear
Miss

said
Susan
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
silent
tomb
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
says
,
"
here
Susan
burst
into
a
violent
hysterical
laugh
,
"
that
he
'll
go
down
into
it
now
immediately

quite
comfortable
,
but
bless
your
heart
<EOS>
my
dear
Miss
Floy
<EOS>
he
wo
n't
,
he
's
a
great
deal
too
happy
in
seeing
other
people
happy
for
that
,
he
may
not
be
a
Solomon
,
"
pursued
the
Nipper
,
with
her
usual
volubility
,
"
nor
do
I
say
he
is
<EOS>
but
this
I
do
say
a
less
selfish
human
creature
human
nature
never
knew
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Nipper
being
still
hysterical
,
laughed
immoderately
after
making
this
energetic
declaration
,
and
then
informed
Florence
that
he
was
waiting
below
to
see
her
;
which
would
be
a
rich
repayment
for
the
trouble
he
had
had
in
his
late
expedition
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
entreated
Susan
to
beg
of
Mr
Toots
as
a
favour
that
she
might
have
the
pleasure
of
thanking
him
for
his
kindness
;
and
Susan
,
in
a
few
moments
,
produced
that
young
gentleman
,
still
very
much
dishevelled
in
appearance
,
and
stammering
exceedingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dombey
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
To
be
again
permitted
to
---
to
---
gaze

at
least
,
not
to
gaze
,
but
<EOS>
---
I
do
n't
exactly
know
what
I
was
going
to
say
,
but
it
's
of
no
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
thank
you
so
often
,
"
returned
Florence
,
giving
him
both
her
hands
,
with
all
her
innocent
gratitude
beaming
in
her
face
,
"
that
I
have
no
words
left
,
and
do
n't
know
how
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dombey
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
in
an
awful
voice
,
"
if
it
was
possible
that
you
could
,
consistently
with
your
angelic
nature

Curse
me

<EOS>
you
would
---
if
I
may
be
allowed
to
say
so
---
floor
me
infinitely
less
,
than
by
these
undeserved
expressions
of
kindness
.
<EOS>
Their
effect
upon
me
---
is
---
but
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
abruptly
,
"
this
is
a
digression
,
and
's
of
no
consequence
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
there
seemed
to
be
no
means
of
replying
to
this
,
but
by
thanking
him
again
,
Florence
thanked
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
wish
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
to
take
this
opportunity
,
Miss
Dombey
,
if
I
might
,
of
entering
into
a
word
of
explanation
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
had
the
pleasure
of
---
of
returning
with
Susan
at
an
earlier
period
;
but
,
in
the
first
place
,
we
did
n't
know
the
name
of
the
relation
to
whose
house
she
had
gone
,
and
,
in
the
second
,
as
she
had
left
that
relation
's
and
gone
to
another
at
a
distance
,
I
think
that
scarcely
anything
short
of
the
sagacity
of
the
Chicken
,
would
have
found
her
out
in
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
was
sure
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
,
however
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
is
not
the
point
.
<EOS>
The
company
of
Susan
has
been
,
I
assure
you
,
Miss
Dombey
,
a
consolation
and
satisfaction
to
me
,
in
my
state
of
mind
,
more
easily
conceived
than
described
.
<EOS>
The
journey
has
been
its
own
reward
.
<EOS>
That
,
however
,
still
,
is
not
the
point
.
<EOS>
Miss
Dombey
,
I
have
before
observed
that
I
know
I
am
not
what
is
considered
a
quick
person
.
<EOS>
I
am
perfectly
aware
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
anybody
could
be
better
acquainted
with
his
own
---
if
it
was
not
too
strong
an
expression
,
I
should
say
with
the
thickness
of
his
own
head
---
than
myself
.
<EOS>
But
,
Miss
Dombey
,
I
do
,
notwithstanding
,
perceive
the
state
of
---
of
things
---
with
Lieutenant
Walters
.
<EOS>
Whatever
agony
that
state
of
things
may
have
caused
me
(
which
is
of
no
consequence
at
all
)
,
I
am
bound
to
say
,
that
Lieutenant
Walters
is
a
person
who
appears
to
be
worthy
of
the
blessing
that
has
fallen
on
his
---
on
his
brow
.
<EOS>
May
he
wear
it
long
,
and
appreciate
it
,
as
a
very
different
,
and
very
unworthy
individual
,
that
it
is
of
no
consequence
to
name
,
would
have
done
!
<EOS>
That
,
however
,
still
,
is
not
the
point
.
<EOS>
Miss
Dombey
,
Captain
Gills
is
a
friend
of
mine
;
and
during
the
interval
that
is
now
elapsing
,
I
believe
it
would
afford
Captain
Gills
pleasure
to
see
me
occasionally
coming
backwards
and
forwards
here
.
<EOS>
It
would
afford
me
pleasure
so
to
come
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
forget
that
I
once
committed
myself
,
fatally
,
at
the
corner
of
the
Square
at
Brighton
;
and
if
my
presence
will
be
,
in
the
least
degree
,
unpleasant
to
you
,
I
only
ask
you
to
name
it
to
me
now
,
and
assure
you
that
I
shall
perfectly
understand
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
consider
it
at
all
unkind
,
and
shall
only
be
too
delighted
and
happy
to
be
honoured
with
your
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Toots
,
"
returned
Florence
,
"
if
you
,
who
are
so
old
and
true
a
friend
of
mine
,
were
to
stay
away
from
this
house
now
,
you
would
make
me
very
unhappy
.
<EOS>
It
can
never
,
never
,
give
me
any
feeling
but
pleasure
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dombey
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
taking
out
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
"
if
I
shed
a
tear
,
it
is
a
tear
of
joy
.
<EOS>
It
is
of
no
consequence
,
and
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
may
be
allowed
to
remark
,
after
what
you
have
so
kindly
said
,
that
it
is
not
my
intention
to
neglect
my
person
any
longer
.
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
received
this
intimation
with
the
prettiest
expression
of
perplexity
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
that
I
shall
consider
it
my
duty
as
a
fellow
-
creature
generally
,
until
I
am
claimed
by
the
silent
tomb
,
to
make
the
best
of
myself
,
and
to
---
to
have
my
boots
as
brightly
polished
,
as
---
as
circumstances
will
admit
of
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
last
time
,
Miss
Dombey
,
of
my
intruding
any
observation
of
a
private
and
personal
nature
.
<EOS>
I
thank
you
very
much
indeed
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
not
,
in
a
general
way
,
as
sensible
as
my
friends
could
wish
me
to
be
,
or
as
I
could
wish
myself
,
I
really
am
,
upon
my
word
and
honour
,
particularly
sensible
of
what
is
considerate
and
kind
.
<EOS>
I
feel
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
in
an
impassioned
tone
,
"
as
if
I
could
express
my
feelings
,
at
the
present
moment
,
in
a
most
remarkable
manner
,
if
---
if
---
I
could
only
get
a
start
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Appearing
not
to
get
it
,
after
waiting
a
minute
or
two
to
see
if
it
would
come
,
Mr
Toots
,
took
a
hasty
leave
,
and
went
below
to
seek
the
Captain
,
whom
he
found
in
the
shop
.
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Gills
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
what
is
now
to
take
place
between
us
,
takes
place
under
the
sacred
seal
of
confidence
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
sequel
,
Captain
Gills
,
of
what
has
taken
place
between
myself
and
Miss
Dombey
,
up
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alow
and
aloft
,
eh
,
my
lad
?
"
murmured
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
so
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
whose
fervour
of
acquiescence
was
greatly
heightened
by
his
entire
ignorance
of
the
Captain
's
meaning
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Miss
Dombey
,
I
believe
,
Captain
Gills
,
is
to
be
shortly
united
to
Lieutenant
Walters
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
aye
,
my
lad

<EOS>
We
're
all

Wal'r

jined
together

whispered
Captain
Cuttle
,
in
his
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
askings
,
Captain
Gills
!
"
repeated
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
church

down
yonder

said
the
Captain
,
pointing
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
Yes

"
returned
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
in
his
hoarse
whisper
,
and
tapping
Mr
Toots
on
the
chest
with
the
back
of
his
hand
,
and
falling
from
him
with
a
look
of
infinite
admiration
,
"
what
follers

<EOS>
That
there
pretty
creetur

as
delicately
brought
up

<EOS>
The

took
him
up

Mr

When
she
,
cast
out
of
home
,
come
here
to
me
,
and
dropped
upon
them
planks
,
her
wownded
heart
was
broke
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
I
,
Ed'ard
Cuttle
,
see
it
.
<EOS>
There
's

but
true
,
kind
,
steady
love
,
as
can
ever
piece
it
up
again
.
<EOS>
If
so
be
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
that
,
and
did
n't
know
as
Wal'r
was
her
true
love
,
brother
,
and
she
his
<EOS>
,
I
'd
have
these
here
blue
arms
and
legs
chopped
off
,
<EOS>
afore
I
'd
let
her
go
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
know
it
,
and
what
then
?
<EOS>
Why
,
then
,
I
say
,
Heaven
go
with
'em
both
,
and
so
it
will
!
<EOS>
Amen

Captain
Gills
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
shaking
hands
.
<EOS>
You
've
a
way
of
saying
things
,
that
gives
me
an
agreeable
warmth
,
all
up
my
back
.
<EOS>
I
say
Amen
.
<EOS>
You
are
aware
,
Captain
Gills
,
that
I
,
too
,
have
adored
Miss
Dombey

<EOS>
"
  
"
Cheer
up
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
Captain
,
laying
his
hand
on
Mr
Toots
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
Stand
by
,
boy
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
intention
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
returned
the
spirited
Mr
Toots
,
"
to
cheer
up
.
<EOS>
Also
to
stand
by
,
as
much
as
possible
.
<EOS>
When
the
silent
tomb
shall
yawn
,
Captain
Gills
,
I
shall
be
ready
for
burial
;
not
before
.
<EOS>
But
not
being
certain
,
just
at
present
,
of
my
power
over
myself
,
what
I
wish
to
say
to
you
,
and
what
I
shall
take
it
as
a
particular
favour
if
you
will
mention
to
Lieutenant
Walters
,
is
as
follows
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Is
as
follers
,
"
echoed
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
Steady
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dombey
being
so
inexpressibly
kind
,
"
continued
Mr
Toots
with
watery
eyes
,
"
as
to
say
that
my
presence
is
the
reverse
of
disagreeable
to
her
,
and
you
and
everybody
here
being
no
less
forbearing
and
tolerant
towards
one
<EOS>
who
---
who
certainly
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
with
momentary
dejection
,
"
would
appear
to
have
been
born
by
mistake
,
I
shall
come
backwards
and
forwards
of
an
evening
,
during
the
short
time
we
can
all
be
together
.
<EOS>
But
what
I
ask
is
this
.
<EOS>
If
,
at
any
moment
,
I
find
that
I
can
not
endure
the
contemplation
of
Lieutenant
Walters
's
bliss
,
and
should
rush
out
,
I
hope
,
Captain
Gills
,
that
you
and
he
will
both
consider
it
as
my
misfortune
and
not
my
fault
,
or
the
want
of
inward
conflict
.
<EOS>
That
you
'll
feel
convinced
I
bear
no
malice
to
any
living
creature
---
least
of
all
to
Lieutenant
Walters
himself
---
and
that
you
'll
casually
remark
that
I
have
gone
out
for
a
walk
,
or
probably
to
see
what
o'clock
it
is
by
the
Royal
Exchange
.
<EOS>
Captain
Gills
,
if
your
could
enter
into
this
arrangement
,
and
could
answer
for
Lieutenant
Walters
,
it
would
be
a
relief
to
my
feelings
that
I
should
think
cheap
at
the
sacrifice
of
a
considerable
portion
of
my
property
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lad
,
"
returned
the
Captain
,
"
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
There
ai
n't
a
colour
you
can
run
up
,
as
wo
n't
be
made
out
,
and
answered
to
,
by
Wal'r
and
self
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Gills
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
my
mind
is
greatly
relieved
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
preserve
the
good
opinion
of
all
here
.
<EOS>
I
---
<EOS>
I
---
mean
well
,
upon
my
honour
,
however
badly
I
may
show
it
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
it
's
exactly
as
if
Burgess
and
Co.
wished
to
oblige
a
customer
with
a
most
extraordinary
pair
of
trousers
,
and
could
not
cut
out
what
they
had
in
their
minds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
apposite
illustration
,
of
which
he
seemed
a
little
proud
,
Mr
Toots
gave
captain
Cuttle
his
blessing
and
departed
.
  
<EOS>
The
honest
Captain
,
with
his
Heart
's
Delight
in
the
house
,
and
Susan
tending
her
,
was
a
beaming
and
a
happy
man
.
<EOS>
As
the
days
flew
by
,
he
grew
more
beaming
and
more
happy
,
every
day
.
<EOS>
After
some
conferences
with
Susan
(
for
whose
wisdom
the
Captain
had
a
profound
respect
,
and
whose
valiant
precipitation
of
herself
on
Mrs
MacStinger
he
could
never
forget
)
,
he
proposed
to
Florence
that
the
daughter
of
the
elderly
lady
who
usually
sat
under
the
blue
umbrella
in
Leadenhall
Market
,
should
,
for
prudential
reasons
and
considerations
of
privacy
,
be
superseded
in
the
temporary
discharge
of
the
household
duties
,
by
some
one
who
was
not
unknown
to
them
,
and
in
whom
they
could
safely
confide
.
<EOS>
Susan
,
being
present
,
then
named
,
in
furtherance
of
a
suggestion
she
had
previously
offered
to
the
Captain
,
Mrs
Richards
.
<EOS>
Florence
brightened
at
the
name
.
<EOS>
And
Susan
,
setting
off
that
very
afternoon
to
the
Toodle
domicile
,
to
sound
Mrs
Richards
,
returned
in
triumph
the
same
evening
,
accompanied
by
the
identical
rosy
-
cheeked
apple
-
faced
Polly
,
whose
demonstrations
,
when
brought
into
Florence
's
presence
,
were
hardly
less
affectionate
than
those
of
Susan
Nipper
herself
.
  
<EOS>
This
piece
of
generalship
accomplished
;
from
which
the
Captain
derived
uncommon
satisfaction
,
as
he
did
,
indeed
,
from
everything
else
that
was
done
,
whatever
it
happened
to
be
;
Florence
had
next
to
prepare
Susan
for
their
approaching
separation
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
much
more
difficult
task
,
as
Miss
Nipper
was
of
a
resolute
disposition
,
and
had
fully
made
up
her
mind
that
she
had
come
back
never
to
be
parted
from
her
old
mistress
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
wages
dear
Miss
Floy
,
"
she
said
,
"
you
would
n't
hint
and
wrong
me
so
as
think
of
naming
them
,
for
I
've
put
money
by
and
would
n't
sell
my
love
and
duty
at
a
time
like
this
even
if
the
Savings
'
Banks
and
me
were
total
strangers
or
the
Banks
were
broke
to
pieces
,
but
you
've
never
been
without
me
darling
from
the
time
your
poor
dear
ma
was
took
away
,
and
though
I
'm
nothing
to
be
boasted
of
you
<EOS>
're
used
to
me
<EOS>
and
oh
my
own
dear
mistress
through
so
many
years
do
n't
think
of
going
anywhere
without
me
,
for
it
must
n't
and
ca
n't
be

"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Susan
,
I
am
going
on
a
long
,
long
voyage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
Miss
Floy
,
and
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
the
more
you
'll
want
me
.
<EOS>
Lengths
of
voyages
ai
n't
an
object
in
my
eyes
,
thank
God
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
impetuous
Susan
Nipper
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Susan
,
I
am
going
with
Walter
,
and
I
would
go
with
Walter
anywhere
---
everywhere
!
<EOS>
Walter
is
poor
,
and
I
am
very
poor
,
and
I
must
learn
,
now
,
both
to
help
myself
,
and
help
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Miss
Floy
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Susan
,
bursting
out
afresh
,
and
shaking
her
head
violently
,
"
it
's
nothing
new
to
you
to
help
yourself
and
others
too
and
be
the
patientest
and
truest
of
noble
hearts
,
but
let
me
talk
to
Mr
Walter
Gay
and
settle
it
with
him
,
for
suffer
you
to
go
away
across
the
world
alone
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
and
I
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Alone
,
Susan
?
"
returned
Florence
.
"
<EOS>
Alone
?
<EOS>
and
Walter
taking
me
with
him
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
what
a
bright
,
amazed
,
enraptured
smile
was
on
her
face
!
<EOS>
---
He
should
have
seen
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
will
not
speak
to
Walter
if
I
ask
you
not
,
"
she
added
tenderly
;
"
and
pray
do
n't
,
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
Susan
sobbed
"
<EOS>
Why
not
,
Miss
Floy
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Because
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
I
am
going
to
be
his
wife
,
to
give
him
up
my
whole
heart
,
and
to
live
with
him
and
die
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
might
think
,
if
you
said
to
him
what
you
have
said
to
me
,
that
I
am
afraid
of
what
is
before
me
,
or
that
you
have
some
cause
to
be
afraid
for
me
.
<EOS>
Why
,
Susan
,
dear
,
I
love
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Nipper
was
so
much
affected
by
the
quiet
fervour
of
these
words
,
and
simple
,
heartfelt
,
all
-
pervading
earnestness
expressed
in
them
,
and
making
the
speaker
's
face
more
beautiful
and
pure
than
ever
,
that
she
could
only
cling
to
her
again
,
crying
<EOS>
Was
her
little
mistress
really
,
really
going
to
be
married
,
and
pitying
,
caressing
,
and
protecting
her
,
as
she
had
done
before
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
Nipper
,
though
susceptible
of
womanly
weaknesses
,
was
almost
as
capable
of
putting
constraint
upon
herself
as
of
attacking
the
redoubtable
MacStinger
.
<EOS>
From
that
time
,
she
never
returned
to
the
subject
,
but
was
always
cheerful
,
active
,
bustling
,
and
hopeful
.
<EOS>
She
did
,
indeed
,
inform
Mr
Toots
privately
,
that
she
was
only
"
keeping
up
"
for
the
time
,
and
that
when
it
was
all
over
,
and
Miss
Dombey
was
gone
,
she
might
be
expected
to
become
a
spectacle
distressful
;
and
Mr
Toots
did
also
express
that
it
was
his
case
too
,
and
that
they
would
mingle
their
tears
together
;
but
she
never
otherwise
indulged
her
private
feelings
in
the
presence
of
Florence
or
within
the
precincts
of
the
Midshipman
.
  
<EOS>
Limited
and
plain
as
Florence
's
wardrobe
was
---
what
a
contrast
to
that
prepared
for
the
last
marriage
in
which
she
had
taken
part
!
<EOS>
---
there
was
a
good
deal
to
do
in
getting
it
ready
,
and
Susan
Nipper
worked
away
at
her
side
,
all
day
,
with
the
concentrated
zeal
of
fifty
sempstresses
.
<EOS>
The
wonderful
contributions
Captain
Cuttle
would
have
made
to
this
branch
of
the
outfit
,
if
he
had
been
permitted
---
as
pink
parasols
,
tinted
silk
stockings
,
blue
shoes
,
and
other
articles
no
less
necessary
on
shipboard
---
would
occupy
some
space
in
the
recital
.
<EOS>
He
was
induced
,
however
,
by
various
fraudulent
representations
,
to
limit
his
contributions
to
a
workbox
and
dressing
-
case
,
of
each
of
which
he
purchased
the
very
largest
specimen
that
could
be
got
for
money
.
<EOS>
For
ten
days
or
a
fortnight
afterwards
,
he
generally
sat
,
during
the
greater
part
of
the
day
,
gazing
at
these
boxes
;
divided
between
extreme
admiration
of
them
,
and
dejected
misgivings
that
they
were
not
gorgeous
enough
,
and
frequently
diving
out
into
the
street
to
purchase
some
wild
article
that
he
deemed
necessary
to
their
completeness
.
<EOS>
But
his
master
-
stroke
was
,
the
bearing
of
them
both
off
,
suddenly
,
one
morning
,
and
getting
the
two
words
FLORENCE
GAY
engraved
upon
a
brass
heart
inlaid
over
the
lid
of
each
.
<EOS>
After
this
,
he
smoked
four
pipes
successively
in
the
little
parlour
by
himself
,
and
was
discovered
chuckling
,
at
the
expiration
of
as
many
hours
.
  
<EOS>
Walter
was
busy
and
away
all
day
,
but
came
there
every
morning
early
to
see
Florence
,
and
always
passed
the
evening
with
her
.
<EOS>
Florence
never
left
her
high
rooms
but
to
steal
downstairs
to
wait
for
him
when
it
was
his
time
to
come
,
or
,
sheltered
by
his
proud
,
encircling
arm
,
to
bear
him
company
to
the
door
again
,
and
sometimes
peep
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
In
the
twilight
they
were
always
together
.
<EOS>
Oh
blessed
time
!
<EOS>
Oh
wandering
heart
at
rest
!
<EOS>
Oh
deep
,
exhaustless
,
mighty
well
of
love
,
in
which
so
much
was
sunk
!
  
<EOS>
The
cruel
mark
was
on
her
bosom
yet
.
<EOS>
It
rose
against
her
father
with
the
breath
she
drew
,
it
lay
between
her
and
her
lover
when
he
pressed
her
to
his
heart
.
<EOS>
But
she
forgot
it
.
<EOS>
In
the
beating
of
that
heart
for
her
,
and
in
the
beating
of
her
own
for
him
,
all
harsher
music
was
unheard
,
all
stern
unloving
hearts
forgotten
.
<EOS>
Fragile
and
delicate
she
was
,
but
with
a
might
of
love
within
her
that
could
,
and
did
,
create
a
world
to
fly
to
,
and
to
rest
in
,
out
of
his
one
image
.
  
<EOS>
How
often
did
the
great
house
,
and
the
old
days
,
come
before
her
in
the
twilight
time
,
when
she
was
sheltered
by
the
arm
,
so
proud
,
so
fond
,
and
,
<EOS>
creeping
closer
to
him
,
shrunk
within
it
at
the
recollection
!
<EOS>
How
often
,
from
remembering
the
night
when
she
went
down
to
that
room
and
met
the
never
-
to
-
be
-
forgotten
look
,
did
she
raise
her
eyes
to
those
that
watched
her
with
such
loving
earnestness
,
and
weep
with
happiness
in
such
a
refuge
!
<EOS>
The
more
she
clung
to
it
,
the
more
the
dear
dead
child
was
in
her
thoughts
:
<EOS>
but
as
if
the
last
time
she
had
seen
her
father
,
had
been
when
he
was
sleeping
and
she
kissed
his
face
,
she
always
left
him
so
,
and
never
,
in
her
fancy
,
passed
that
hour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Walter
,
dear
,
"
said
Florence
,
one
evening
,
when
it
was
almost
dark
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
Know
what
I
have
been
thinking
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thinking
how
the
time
is
flying
on
,
and
how
soon
we
shall
be
upon
the
sea
,
sweet
Florence
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
that
,
Walter
,
though
I
think
of
that
too
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
thinking
what
a
charge
I
am
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
precious
,
sacred
charge
,
dear
heart
!
<EOS>
Why
Ithink
that
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
laughing
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
's
much
more
in
your
thoughts
than
mine
.
<EOS>
But
I
mean
a
cost
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
cost
,
my
own
?
"
  
"
In
money
,
dear
.
<EOS>
All
these
preparations
that
Susan
and
I
are
so
busy
with
<EOS>
---
I
have
been
able
to
purchase
very
little
for
myself
.
<EOS>
You
were
poor
before
.
<EOS>
But
how
much
poorer
I
shall
make
you
,
Walter
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
much
richer
,
Florence
!
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
laughed
,
and
shook
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
long
ago
---
before
I
went
to
sea
---
I
had
a
little
purse
presented
to
me
,
dearest
,
which
had
money
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
!
"
returned
Florence
,
laughing
sorrowfully
,
"
very
little!Very
little
,
Walter
!
<EOS>
But
,
you
must
not
think
,
"
and
here
she
laid
her
light
hand
on
his
shoulder
,
and
looked
into
his
face
,
"
that
I
regret
to
be
this
burden
on
you
.
<EOS>
No
,
dear
love
,
I
am
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
happy
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
it
otherwise
for
all
the
world
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
I
,
indeed
,
dear
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
<EOS>
but
,
Walter
,
you
can
never
feel
it
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
proud
of
you
!
<EOS>
It
makes
my
heart
swell
with
such
delight
to
know
that
those
who
speak
of
you
must
say
you
married
a
poor
disowned
girl
,
who
had
taken
shelter
here
;
who
had
no
other
home
,
no
other
friends
;
who
had
nothing
---
nothing
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
Walter
,
if
I
could
have
brought
you
millions
,
I
never
could
have
been
so
happy
for
your
sake
,
as
I
am
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
,
dear
Florence
?
are
you
nothing
?
"
<EOS>
he
returned
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
nothing
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
Nothing
but
your
wife
.
<EOS>
"
The
light
hand
stole
about
his
neck
,
and
the
voice
came
nearer
---
nearer
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
nothing
any
more
,
that
is
not
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
earthly
hope
any
more
,
that
is
not
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
dear
to
me
any
more
,
that
is
not
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
well
might
Mr
Toots
leave
the
little
company
that
evening
,
and
twice
go
out
to
correct
his
watch
by
the
Royal
Exchange
,
and
once
to
keep
an
appointment
with
a
banker
which
he
suddenly
remembered
,
and
once
to
take
a
little
turn
to
Aldgate
Pump
and
back
!
  
<EOS>
But
before
he
went
upon
these
expeditions
,
or
indeed
before
he
came
,
and
before
lights
were
brought
,
Walter
said
:
  
"
Florence
,
love
,
the
lading
of
our
ship
is
nearly
finished
,
and
probably
on
the
very
day
of
our
marriage
she
will
drop
down
the
river
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
go
away
that
morning
,
and
stay
in
Kent
until
we
go
on
board
at
Gravesend
within
a
week
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
happy
anywhere
.
<EOS>
But
  
"
Yes
,
my
life
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
that
we
shall
have
no
marriage
party
,
and
that
nobody
will
distinguish
us
by
our
dress
from
other
people
.
<EOS>
As
we
leave
the
same
day
,
will
you
---
will
you
take
me
somewhere
that
morning
,
Walter
---
early
---
before
we
go
to
church
?
"
  
<EOS>
Walter
seemed
to
understand
her
,
as
so
true
a
lover
so
truly
loved
should
,
and
confirmed
his
ready
promise
with
a
kiss
---
with
more
than
one
perhaps
,
or
two
or
three
,
or
five
or
six
;
and
in
the
grave
,
peaceful
evening
,
Florence
was
very
happy
.
  
<EOS>
Then
into
the
quiet
room
came
Susan
Nipper
and
the
candles
:
shortly
afterwards
,
the
tea
,
the
Captain
,
and
the
excursive
Mr
Toots
,
who
,
as
above
mentioned
,
was
frequently
on
the
move
afterwards
,
and
passed
but
a
restless
evening
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
not
his
habit
:
for
he
generally
got
on
very
well
,
by
dint
of
playing
at
cribbage
with
the
Captain
under
the
advice
and
guidance
of
Miss
Nipper
,
and
distracting
his
mind
with
the
calculations
incidental
to
the
game
;
which
he
found
to
be
a
very
effectual
means
of
utterly
confounding
himself
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
's
visage
on
these
occasions
presented
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
combination
and
succession
of
expression
ever
observed
.
<EOS>
His
instinctive
delicacy
and
his
chivalrous
feeling
towards
Florence
,
taught
him
that
it
was
not
a
time
for
any
boisterous
jollity
,
or
violent
display
of
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Certain
floating
reminiscences
of
Lovely
Peg
,
on
the
other
hand
,
were
constantly
struggling
for
a
vent
,
and
urging
the
Captain
to
commit
himself
by
some
irreparable
demonstration
.
<EOS>
Anon
,
his
admiration
of
Florence
and
Walter
---
well
-
matched
,
truly
,
and
full
of
grace
and
interest
in
their
youth
,
and
love
,
and
good
looks
,
as
they
sat
apart
---
would
take
such
complete
possession
of
him
,
that
he
would
lay
down
his
cards
,
and
beam
upon
them
,
dabbing
his
head
all
over
with
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
;
until
warned
,
perhaps
,
by
the
sudden
rushing
forth
of
Mr
Toots
,
that
he
had
unconsciously
been
very
instrumental
,
indeed
,
in
making
that
gentleman
miserable
.
<EOS>
This
reflection
would
make
the
Captain
profoundly
melancholy
,
until
the
return
of
Mr
Toots
;
when
he
would
fall
to
his
cards
again
,
with
many
side
winks
and
nods
,
and
polite
waves
of
his
hook
at
Miss
Nipper
,
importing
that
he
was
n't
going
to
do
so
any
more
.
<EOS>
The
state
that
ensued
on
this
,
was
,
perhaps
,
his
best
;
for
then
,
endeavouring
to
discharge
all
expression
from
his
face
,
he
would
sit
,
staring
round
the
room
,
with
all
these
expressions
conveyed
into
it
at
once
,
and
each
wrestling
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
Delighted
admiration
of
Florence
and
Walter
always
overthrew
the
rest
,
and
remained
victorious
and
undisguised
,
unless
Mr
Toots
made
another
rush
into
the
air
,
and
then
the
Captain
would
sit
,
like
a
remorseful
culprit
,
until
he
came
back
again
,
occasionally
calling
upon
himself
,
in
a
low
reproachful
voice
,
to
"
Stand
by
!
"
or
growling
some
remonstrance
to
"
Ed'ard
<EOS>
Cuttle
,
my
lad
,
"
on
the
want
of
caution
observable
in
his
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
Mr
Toots
's
hardest
trials
,
however
,
was
of
his
own
seeking
.
<EOS>
On
the
approach
of
the
Sunday
which
was
to
witness
the
last
of
those
askings
in
church
of
which
the
Captain
had
spoken
,
Mr
Toots
thus
stated
his
feelings
to
Susan
Nipper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Susan
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
I
am
drawn
towards
the
building
.
<EOS>
The
words
which
cut
me
off
from
Miss
Dombey
for
ever
,
will
strike
upon
my
ears
like
a
knell
you
know
,
but
upon
my
word
and
honour
,
I
feel
that
I
must
hear
them
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
will
you
accompany
me
to
-
morrow
,
to
the
sacred
edifice
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Nipper
expressed
her
readiness
to
do
so
,
if
that
would
be
any
satisfaction
to
Mr
Toots
,
but
besought
him
to
abandon
his
idea
of
going
.
  
<EOS>
"
Susan
,
"
returned
Mr
Toots
,
with
much
solemnity
,
"
before
my
whiskers
began
to
be
observed
by
anybody
but
myself
,
I
adored
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
While
yet
a
victim
to
the
thraldom
of
Blimber
,
I
adored
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
When
I
could
no
longer
be
kept
out
of
my
property
,
in
a
legal
point
of
view
,
and
---
and
accordingly
came
into
it
---
I
adored
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
The
banns
which
consign
her
to
Lieutenant
Walters
,
and
me
to
---
to
Gloom
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
after
hesitating
for
a
strong
expression
,
"
may
be
dreadful
,
will
be
dreadful
;
but
I
feel
that
I
should
wish
to
hear
them
spoken
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
should
wish
to
know
that
the
ground
was
certainly
cut
from
under
me
,
and
that
I
had
n't
a
hope
to
cherish
,
or
a
---
or
a
leg
,
in
short
,
to
---
to
go
upon
.
"
  
<EOS>
Susan
Nipper
could
only
commiserate
Mr
Toots
's
unfortunate
condition
,
and
agree
,
under
these
circumstances
,
to
accompany
him
;
which
she
did
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
The
church
Walter
had
chosen
for
the
purpose
,
was
a
mouldy
old
church
in
a
yard
,
hemmed
in
by
a
labyrinth
of
back
streets
and
courts
,
with
a
little
burying
-
ground
round
it
,
and
itself
buried
in
a
kind
of
vault
,
formed
by
the
neighbouring
houses
,
and
paved
with
echoing
stones
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
dim
,
shabby
pile
,
with
high
old
oaken
pews
,
among
which
about
a
score
of
people
lost
themselves
every
Sunday
;
while
the
clergyman
's
voice
drowsily
resounded
through
the
emptiness
,
and
the
organ
rumbled
and
rolled
as
if
the
church
had
got
the
colic
,
for
want
of
a
congregation
to
keep
the
wind
and
damp
out
.
<EOS>
But
so
far
was
this
city
church
from
languishing
for
the
company
of
other
churches
,
that
spires
were
clustered
round
it
,
as
the
masts
of
shipping
cluster
on
the
river
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
hard
to
count
them
from
its
steeple
-
top
,
they
were
so
many
.
<EOS>
In
almost
every
yard
and
blind
-
place
near
,
there
was
a
church
.
<EOS>
The
confusion
of
bells
when
Susan
and
Mr
Toots
betook
themselves
towards
it
on
the
Sunday
morning
,
was
deafening
.
<EOS>
There
were
twenty
churches
close
together
,
clamouring
for
people
to
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
stray
sheep
in
question
were
penned
by
a
beadle
in
a
commodious
pew
,
and
,
being
early
,
sat
for
some
time
counting
the
congregation
,
listening
to
the
disappointed
bell
high
up
in
the
tower
,
or
looking
at
a
shabby
little
old
man
in
the
porch
behind
the
screen
,
who
was
ringing
the
same
,
like
the
Bull
in
Cock
Robin
,
with
his
foot
in
a
stirrup
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
after
a
lengthened
survey
of
the
large
books
on
the
reading
-
desk
,
whispered
Miss
Nipper
that
he
wondered
where
the
banns
were
kept
,
but
that
young
lady
merely
shook
her
head
and
forward
;
repelling
for
the
time
all
approaches
of
a
temporal
nature
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
however
,
appearing
unable
to
keep
his
thoughts
from
the
banns
,
was
evidently
looking
out
for
them
during
the
whole
preliminary
portion
of
the
service
.
<EOS>
As
the
time
for
reading
them
approached
,
the
poor
young
gentleman
manifested
great
anxiety
and
trepidation
,
which
was
not
diminished
by
the
unexpected
apparition
of
the
Captain
in
the
front
row
of
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
When
the
clerk
handed
up
a
list
to
the
clergyman
,
Mr
Toots
,
being
then
seated
,
held
on
by
the
seat
of
the
pew
;
but
when
the
names
of
Walter
Gay
and
Florence
Dombey
were
read
aloud
as
being
in
the
third
and
last
stage
of
that
association
,
he
was
so
entirely
conquered
by
his
feelings
as
to
rush
from
the
church
without
his
hat
,
followed
by
the
beadle
and
pew
-
opener
,
and
two
gentlemen
of
the
medical
profession
,
who
happened
to
be
present
;
of
whom
the
first
-
named
presently
returned
for
that
article
,
informing
Miss
Nipper
in
a
whisper
that
she
was
not
to
make
herself
uneasy
about
the
gentleman
,
as
the
gentleman
said
his
indisposition
was
of
no
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Nipper
,
feeling
that
the
eyes
of
that
integral
portion
of
Europe
which
lost
itself
weekly
among
the
high
-
backed
pews
,
were
upon
her
,
would
have
been
sufficiently
embarrassed
by
this
incident
,
though
it
had
terminated
here
;
the
more
so
,
as
the
Captain
in
the
front
row
of
the
gallery
,
was
in
a
state
of
unmitigated
consciousness
which
could
hardly
fail
to
express
to
the
congregation
that
he
had
some
mysterious
connexion
with
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
extreme
restlessness
of
Mr
Toots
painfully
increased
and
protracted
the
delicacy
of
her
situation
.
<EOS>
That
young
gentleman
,
incapable
,
in
his
state
of
mind
,
of
remaining
alone
in
the
churchyard
,
a
prey
to
solitary
meditation
,
and
also
desirous
,
no
doubt
,
of
testifying
his
respect
for
the
offices
he
had
in
some
measure
interrupted
,
suddenly
returned
---
not
coming
back
to
the
pew
,
but
stationing
himself
on
a
free
seat
in
the
aisle
,
between
two
elderly
females
who
were
in
the
habit
of
receiving
their
portion
of
a
weekly
dole
of
bread
then
set
forth
on
a
shelf
in
the
porch
.
<EOS>
In
this
conjunction
Mr
Toots
remained
,
greatly
disturbing
the
congregation
,
who
felt
it
impossible
to
avoid
looking
at
him
,
until
his
feelings
overcame
him
again
,
when
he
departed
silently
and
suddenly
.
<EOS>
Not
venturing
to
trust
himself
in
the
church
any
more
,
and
yet
wishing
to
have
some
social
participation
in
what
was
going
on
there
,
Mr
Toots
was
after
this
,
seen
from
time
to
time
,
looking
in
,
with
a
lorn
aspect
,
at
one
or
other
of
the
windows
;
and
as
there
were
several
windows
accessible
to
him
from
without
,
and
as
his
restlessness
was
very
great
,
it
not
only
became
difficult
to
conceive
at
which
window
he
would
appear
next
,
but
likewise
became
necessary
,
as
it
were
,
for
the
whole
congregation
to
speculate
upon
the
chances
of
the
different
windows
,
during
the
comparative
leisure
afforded
them
by
the
sermon
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
's
movements
in
the
churchyard
were
so
eccentric
,
that
he
seemed
generally
to
defeat
all
calculation
,
and
to
appear
,
like
the
conjuror
's
figure
,
where
he
was
least
expected
;
and
the
effect
of
these
mysterious
presentations
was
much
increased
by
its
being
difficult
to
him
to
see
in
,
and
easy
to
everybody
else
to
see
out
:
which
occasioned
his
remaining
,
every
time
,
longer
than
might
have
been
expected
,
with
his
face
close
to
the
glass
,
until
he
all
at
once
became
aware
that
all
eyes
were
upon
him
,
and
vanished
.
  
<EOS>
These
proceedings
on
the
part
of
Mr
Toots
,
and
the
strong
individual
consciousness
of
them
that
was
exhibited
by
the
Captain
,
rendered
Miss
Nipper
's
position
so
responsible
a
one
,
that
she
was
mightily
relieved
by
the
conclusion
of
the
service
;
and
was
hardly
so
affable
to
Mr
Toots
as
usual
,
when
he
informed
her
and
the
Captain
,
on
the
way
back
,
that
now
he
was
sure
he
had
no
hope
,
you
know
,
he
felt
more
comfortable
---
at
least
not
exactly
more
comfortable
,
but
more
comfortably
and
completely
miserable
.
  
<EOS>
Swiftly
now
,
indeed
,
the
time
flew
by
until
it
was
the
evening
before
the
day
appointed
for
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
assembled
in
the
upper
room
at
the
Midshipman
's
,
and
had
no
fear
of
interruption
;
for
there
were
no
lodgers
in
the
house
now
,
and
the
Midshipman
had
it
all
to
himself
.
<EOS>
They
were
grave
and
quiet
in
the
prospect
of
to
-
morrow
,
but
moderately
cheerful
too
.
<EOS>
Florence
,
with
Walter
close
beside
her
,
was
finishing
a
little
piece
of
work
intended
as
a
parting
gift
to
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
was
playing
cribbage
with
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
was
taking
counsel
as
to
his
hand
,
of
Susan
Nipper
.
<EOS>
Miss
Nipper
was
giving
it
,
with
all
due
secrecy
and
circumspection
.
<EOS>
Diogenes
was
listening
,
and
occasionally
breaking
out
into
a
gruff
half
-
smothered
fragment
of
a
bark
,
of
which
he
afterwards
seemed
half
-
ashamed
,
as
if
he
doubted
having
any
reason
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Steady
,
steady
!
"
said
the
Captain
to
Diogenes
,
"
<EOS>
what
's
amiss
with
you
?
<EOS>
You
do
n't
seem
easy
in
your
mind
to
-
night
,
my
boy
!
"
  
<EOS>
Diogenes
wagged
his
tail
,
but
pricked
up
his
ears
immediately
afterwards
,
and
gave
utterance
to
another
fragment
of
a
bark
;
for
which
he
apologised
to
the
Captain
,
by
again
wagging
his
tail
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
opinion
,
Di
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
looking
thoughtfully
at
his
cards
,
and
stroking
his
chin
with
his
hook
,
"
as
you
have
your
doubts
of
Mrs
Richards
;
but
if
you
're
the
animal
I
take
you
to
be
,
you
'll
think
better
o
'
that
;
for
her
looks
is
her
commission
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Brother
:
"
to
Mr
Toots
:
"
if
so
be
as
you
're
ready
,
heave
ahead
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
spoke
with
all
composure
and
attention
to
the
game
,
but
suddenly
his
cards
dropped
out
of
his
hand
,
his
mouth
and
eyes
opened
wide
,
his
legs
drew
themselves
up
and
stuck
out
in
front
of
his
chair
,
and
he
sat
staring
at
the
door
with
blank
amazement
.
<EOS>
Looking
round
upon
the
company
,
and
seeing
that
none
of
them
observed
him
or
the
cause
of
his
astonishment
,
the
Captain
recovered
himself
with
a
great
gasp
,
struck
the
table
a
tremendous
blow
,
cried
in
a
stentorian
roar
,
"
Sol
Gills
ahoy
!
"
and
tumbled
into
the
arms
of
a
weather
-
beaten
pea
-
coat
that
had
come
with
Polly
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
In
another
moment
,
Walter
was
in
the
arms
of
the
weather
-
beaten
pea
-
coat
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
,
Florence
was
in
the
arms
of
the
weather
-
beaten
pea
-
coat
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
,
Captain
Cuttle
had
embraced
Mrs
Richards
and
Miss
Nipper
,
and
was
violently
shaking
hands
with
Mr
Toots
,
exclaiming
,
as
he
waved
his
hook
above
his
head
,
"
Hooroar
,
my
lad
,
hooroar
!
"
<EOS>
To
which
Mr
Toots
,
wholly
at
a
loss
to
account
for
these
proceedings
,
replied
with
great
politeness
,
"
Certainly
,
Captain
Gills
,
whatever
you
think
proper
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
weather
-
beaten
pea
-
coat
,
and
a
no
less
weather
-
beaten
cap
and
comforter
belonging
to
it
,
turned
from
the
Captain
and
from
Florence
back
to
Walter
,
and
sounds
came
from
the
weather
-
beaten
pea
-
coat
,
cap
,
and
comforter
,
as
of
an
old
man
sobbing
underneath
them
;
while
the
shaggy
sleeves
clasped
Walter
tight
.
<EOS>
During
this
pause
,
there
was
an
universal
silence
,
and
the
Captain
polished
his
nose
with
great
diligence
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
pea
-
coat
,
cap
,
and
comforter
lifted
themselves
up
again
,
Florence
gently
moved
towards
them
;
and
she
and
Walter
taking
them
off
,
disclosed
the
old
Instrument
-
maker
,
a
little
thinner
and
more
careworn
than
of
old
,
in
his
old
Welsh
wig
and
his
old
coffee
-
coloured
coat
and
basket
buttons
,
with
his
old
infallible
chronometer
ticking
away
in
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
Chock

said
the
radiant
Captain
,
"

<EOS>
"
I
'm
half

said
the
old
man
,
"
and
almost
deaf
and
dumb
with
joy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His

"
said
the
Captain
,
looking
round
with
an
exultation
to
which
even
his
face
could
hardly
render
justice
---
"
his
wery
woice
as
chock
full

<EOS>
Sol

lay
to

upon
your

<EOS>
Tis

said
the
Captain
,
impressively
,
and
announcing
a
quotation
with
his
hook
,
"
of
the
sluggard

I
heerd
him

<EOS>
Scatter

"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
sat
down
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
happily
expressed
the
feeling
of
everybody
present
,
and
immediately
rose
again
to
present
Mr
Toots
,
who
was
much
disconcerted
by
the
arrival
of
anybody
,
appearing
to
prefer
a
claim
to
the
name
of
Gills
.
  
<EOS>
"
Although
,
"
stammered
Mr
Toots
,
"
I
had
not
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
,
Sir
,
before
you
were
---
you
were
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lost
to

suggested
the
Captain
,
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
so
,
Captain
Gills
!
"
assented
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
Although
I
had
not
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
,
Mr

Mr
Sols

"
said
Toots
,
hitting
on
that
name
in
the
inspiration
of
a
bright
idea
,
"
before
that
happened
,
I
have
the
greatest
pleasure
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
in

<EOS>
I

said
Mr
Toots
,
"
that
you
're
as
well
as
can
be
expected

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
these
courteous
words
,
Mr
Toots
sat
down
blushing
and
chuckling
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
Instrument
-
maker
,
seated
in
a
corner
between
Walter
and
Florence
,
and
nodding
at
Polly
,
who
was
looking
on
,
all
smiles
and
delight
,
answered
the
Captain
thus
:
  
<EOS>
"
Ned
Cuttle
,

dear
boy

although
I

heard
something
of

---
what
a
pleasant
face
she
has
to
be
sure
,
to
welcome
a
wanderer
home

"
said
the
old
man
,
breaking
off
,
and
rubbing
his
hands
in
his
old
dreamy
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hear
him
!
"
cried
the
Captain
gravely
.
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
woman

seduces

<EOS>
For

aside
to
Mr

,
"
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
make
a
point
of
doing
so
,
Captain
Gills

said
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
"
Although
I
have
heard
something
of
the
changes
of

from

resumed
the
Instrument
-
maker
,
taking
his
old
spectacles
from
his
pocket
,
and
putting
them
on
his
forehead
in
his
old
manner
,
"
they
are
so
great
and
unexpected
,
and
I
am
so
overpowered
by
the
sight
of
my
dear
boy

---
glancing
at
the
downcast
eyes
of
Florence
,
and
not
attempting
to
finish
the
sentence
---
"
that
I
---
I
ca

night

<EOS>
But
my
dear
Ned
Cuttle
,
why
did
n't
you
write
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
astonishment
depicted
in
the
Captain
's
features
positively
frightened
Mr
Toots
,
whose
eyes
were
quite
fixed
by
it
,
so
that
he
could
not
withdraw
them
from
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Write

"
echoed
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
Write

Sol
Gills

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye

said
the
old
man
,
"
either
to
Barbados

or
Jamaica
,
or
Demerara

<EOS>
That
was
what
I
asked

<EOS>
"
What

asked

repeated
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye

said
the
old
man

"
<EOS>
Do

<EOS>
Sure

have
not
forgotten

<EOS>
Every

I
wrote
to

"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
took
off
his
glazed
hat
,
hung
it
on
his
hook
,
and
smoothing
his
hair
from
behind
with
his
hand
,
sat
gazing
at
the
group
around
him
:
a
perfect
image
of
wondering
resignation
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

n't

"
<EOS>
observed
old
Sol
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sol
Gills

returned
the
Captain
,
after
staring
at
him
and
the
rest
for
a
long
time
,
without
speaking
,
"
<EOS>
I

said
the
Captain

ruminating

and
staring
all
round

<EOS>
"
You

said
Sol
Gills
,
"
why

Did

<EOS>
"
Why

said
the

<EOS>
"
To

I
opened

<EOS>
And
read

said
the
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
read
it

"
answered
the
Captain
,
eyeing
him
attentively
,
and
proceeding
to
quote
it
from
memory
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Ned
Cuttle
,
when
I
left
home
for
the
West
Indies
in
forlorn
search
of
intelligence
of
my
dear
---
"
There
he
sits
!
<EOS>
There
's
Wal'r

"
said
the
Captain
,
as
if
he
were
relieved
by
getting
hold
of
anything
that
was
real
and
indisputable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Ned
.
<EOS>
Now
attend
a
moment
!
"
said
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
wrote
first
---
that
was
from
Barbados
---
I
said
that
though
you
would
receive
that
letter
long
before
the
year
was
out
,
I
should
be
glad
if
you
would
open
the
packet
,
as
it
explained
the
reason
of
my
going
away
.
<EOS>
Very
good
,
Ned
.
<EOS>
When
I
wrote
the
second
,
third
,
and
perhaps
the
fourth
times
---
that
was
from
Jamaica
---
I
said
I
was
in
just
the
same
state
,
could
n't
rest
,
and
could
n't
come
away
from
that
part
of
the
world
,
without
knowing
that
my
boy
was
lost
or
saved
.
<EOS>
When
I
wrote
next
---
that
,
I
think
,
was
from
Demerara
,
was
n't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
he
thinks
was
from
Demerara
,
warn't
it

"
said
the
Captain
,
looking
hopelessly
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
I
said
,
"
proceeded
old
Sol
,
"
that
still
there
was
no
certain
information
got
yet
.
<EOS>
That
I
found
many
captains
and
others
,
in
that
part
of
the
world
,
who
had
known
me
for
years
,
and
who
assisted
me
with
a
passage
here
and
there
,
and
for
whom
I
was
able
,
now
and
then
,
to
do
a
little
in
return
,
in
my
own
craft
.
<EOS>
That
every
one
was
sorry
for
me
,
and
seemed
to
take
a
sort
of
interest
in
my
wanderings
;
and
that
I
began
to
think
it
would
be
my
fate
to
cruise
about
in
search
of
tidings
of
my
boy
until
I
died
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Began
to
think
as
how
he
was
a
scientific
flying
Dutchman
!
"
said
the
Captain
,
as
before
,
and
with
great
seriousness
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
when
the
news
come
one
day
,
Ned
,
---
that
was
to
Barbados
,
after
I
got
back
there
,
---
that
a
China
trader
home'ard
bound
had
been
spoke
,
that
had
my
boy
aboard
,
then
,
Ned
,
I
took
passage
in
the
next
ship
and
came
home
;
arrived
at
home
to
-
night
to
find
it
true
,
thank
God

said
the
old
man
,
devoutly
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
after
bowing
his
head
with
great
reverence
,
stared
all
round
the
circle
,
beginning
with
Mr
Toots
,
and
ending
with
the
Instrument
-
maker
;
then
gravely
said
:
  
"

<EOS>
The

Not

his
declaration
the

impressive

ever

exclaimed
old
Sol
.
  
<EOS>
The
colour
all
went
out
of
the
Captain
's
face
,
and
all
came
back
again
in

Mrs

I
shall

my

I
am
behind

I
always
was

recollect

and
very
much
confused

<EOS>
Mrs

"
Sol
Gills

"
said
the
Captain
,
as
if
he
were
putting
the
most
improbable
case
in
the
world
,
"
it
ai
n't
the
name
of
MacStinger
as
you
're
a
trying
to
remember
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
Instrument
-
maker
.
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
Ned
.
<EOS>
Mrs
MacStinger
!
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
whose
eyes
were
now
as
wide
open
as
they
could
be
,
and
the
knobs
upon
whose
face
were
perfectly
luminous
,
gave
a
long
shrill
whistle
of
a
most
melancholy
sound
,
and
stood
gazing
at
everybody
in
a
state
of
speechlessness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Overhaul
that
there
again
,
Sol
Gills
,
will
you
be
so
kind
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
these
letters
,
"
returned
Uncle
Sol
,
beating
time
with
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
upon
the
palm
of
his
left
,
with
a
steadiness
and
distinctness
that
might
have
done
honour
,
even
to
the
infallible
chronometer
in
his
pocket
,
"
<EOS>
I
posted
with
my
own
hand
,
and
directed
with
my
own
hand
,
to
Captain
Cuttle
,
at
Mrs
MacStinger
's
,
Number
nine
Brig
Place
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Captain
took
his
glazed
hat
off
his
hook
,
looked
into
it
,
put
it
on
,
and
sat
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
friends
all
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
staring
round
in
the
last
state
of
discomfiture
<EOS>
,
"
I
cut
and
run
from
there
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
no
one
knew
where
you
were
gone
,
Captain
Cuttle
?
"
cried
Walter
hastily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
your
heart
,
Wal'r
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
she
'd
never
have
allowed
o
'
my
coming
to
take
charge
o
'
<EOS>
this
here
property
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
done
but
cut
and
run
.
<EOS>
Lord
love
you
,
Wal'r
!
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
you
've
only
seen
her
in
a
calm
!
<EOS>
But
see
her
when
her
angry
passions
rise
---
and
make
a
note
on
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
give
it
her
!
"
<EOS>
remarked
the
Nipper
,
softly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
,
do
you
think
,
my
dear
?
"
returned
the
Captain
with
feeble
admiration
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dear
,
it
does
you
credit
.
<EOS>
But
there
ai
n't
no
wild
animal
I
would
sooner
face
myself
.
<EOS>
I
only
got
my
chest
away
by
means
of
a
friend
as
nobody
's
a
match
for
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
good
sending
any
letter
there
.
<EOS>
She
would
n't
take
in
any
letter
,
bless
you
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
"
under
them
circumstances
!
<EOS>
Why
,
you
could
hardly
make
it
worth
a
man
's
while
to
be
the
postman
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
's
pretty
clear
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
that
all
of
us
,
and
you
and
Uncle
Sol
especially
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
may
thank
Mrs
MacStinger
for
no
small
anxiety
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
general
obligation
in
this
wise
to
the
determined
relict
of
the
late
Mr
MacStinger
,
was
so
apparent
,
that
the
Captain
did
not
contest
the
point
;
but
being
in
some
measure
ashamed
of
his
position
,
though
nobody
dwelt
upon
the
subject
,
and
Walter
especially
avoided
it
,
remembering
the
last
conversation
he
and
the
Captain
had
held
together
respecting
it
,
he
remained
under
a
cloud
for
nearly
five
minutes
---
an
extra
-
ordinary
period
for
him
---
when
that
sun
,
his
face
,
broke
out
once
more
,
shining
on
all
beholders
with
extraordinary
brilliancy
;
and
he
fell
into
a
fit
of
shaking
hands
with
everybody
over
and
over
again
.
  
<EOS>
At
an
early
hour
,
but
not
before
Uncle
Sol
and
Walter
had
questioned
each
other
at
some
length
about
their
voyages
and
dangers
,
they
all
,
except
Walter
,
vacated
Florence
's
room
,
and
went
down
to
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
Here
they
were
soon
afterwards
joined
by
Walter
,
who
told
them
Florence
was
a
little
sorrowful
and
heavy
-
hearted
,
and
had
gone
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Though
they
could
not
have
disturbed
her
with
their
voices
down
there
,
they
all
spoke
in
a
whisper
after
this
:
and
each
,
in
his
different
way
,
felt
very
lovingly
and
gently
towards
Walter
's
fair
young
bride
:
and
a
long
explanation
there
was
of
everything
relating
to
her
,
for
the
satisfaction
of
Uncle
Sol
;
and
very
sensible
Mr
Toots
was
of
the
delicacy
with
which
Walter
made
his
name
and
services
important
,
and
his
presence
necessary
to
their
little
council
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Toots
,
"
said
Walter
,
on
parting
with
him
at
the
house
door
,
"
we
shall
see
each
other
to
-
morrow
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lieutenant
Walters
,
"
returned
Mr
Toots
,
grasping
his
hand
fervently
,
"
I
shall
certainly
be
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
last
night
we
shall
meet
for
a
long
time
---
the
last
night
we
may
ever
meet
,
"
said
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
Such
a
noble
heart
as
yours
,
must
feel
,
I
think
,
when
another
heart
is
bound
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
know
that
I
am
very
grateful
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Walters
,
"
replied
Mr
Toots
,
quite
touched
,
"
I
should
be
glad
to
feel
that
you
had
reason
to
be
so
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Florence
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
on
this
last
night
of
her
bearing
her
own
name
,
has
made
me
promise
<EOS>
---
it
was
only
just
now
,
when
you
left
us
together
---
<EOS>
that
I
would
tell
you
---
with
her
dear
love
---
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
laid
his
hand
upon
the
doorpost
,
and
his
eyes
upon
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
with
her
dear
love
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
that
she
can
never
have
a
friend
whom
she
will
value
above
you
.
<EOS>
That
the
recollection
of
your
true
consideration
for
her
always
,
can
never
be
forgotten
by
her
.
<EOS>
That
she
remembers
you
in
her
prayers
to
-
night
,
and
hopes
that
you
will
think
of
her
when
she
is
far
away
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
say
anything
for
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
,
Walter
,
"
replied
Mr
Toots
indistinctly
,
"
that
I
shall
think
of
her
every
day
,
but
never
without
feeling
happy
to
know
that
she
is
married
to
the
man
she
loves
,
and
who
loves
her
.
<EOS>
Say
,
if
you
please
,
that
I
am
sure
her
husband
deserves
her
---
even
her
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
that
I
am
glad
of
her
choice
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
got
more
distinct
as
he
came
to
these
last
words
,
and
raising
his
eyes
from
the
doorpost
,
said
them
stoutly
.
<EOS>
He
then
shook
Walter
's
hand
again
with
a
fervour
that
Walter
was
not
slow
to
return
,
and
started
homeward
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
was
accompanied
by
the
Chicken
,
whom
he
had
of
late
brought
with
him
every
evening
,
and
left
in
the
shop
,
with
an
idea
that
unforeseen
circumstances
might
arise
from
without
,
in
which
the
prowess
of
that
distinguished
character
would
be
of
service
to
the
Midshipman
.
<EOS>
The
Chicken
did
not
appear
to
be
in
a
particularly
good
humour
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
Either
the
gas
-
lamps
were
treacherous
,
or
he
cocked
his
eye
in
a
hideous
manner
,
and
likewise
distorted
his
nose
,
when
Mr
Toots
,
crossing
the
road
,
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
at
the
room
where
Florence
slept
.
<EOS>
On
the
road
home
,
he
was
more
demonstrative
of
aggressive
intentions
against
the
other
foot
-
passengers
,
than
comported
with
a
professor
of
the
peaceful
art
of
self
-
defence
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
home
,
instead
of
leaving
Mr
Toots
in
his
apartments
when
he
had
escorted
him
thither
,
he
remained
before
him
weighing
his
white
hat
in
both
hands
by
the
brim
,
and
twitching
his
head
and
nose
<EOS>
(
both
of
which
had
been
many
times
broken
,
and
but
indifferently
repaired
)
,
with
an
air
of
decided
disrespect
.
  
<EOS>
His
patron
being
much
engaged
with
his
own
thoughts
,
did
not
observe
this
for
some
time
,
nor
indeed
until
the
Chicken
,
determined
not
to
be
overlooked
,
had
made
divers
clicking
sounds
with
his
tongue
and
teeth
,
to
attract
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Master
,
"
said
the
Chicken
,
doggedly
,
when
he
,
at
length
,
caught
Mr
Toot
's
eye
,
"
I
want
to
know
whether
this
here
gammon
is
to
finish
it
,
or
whether
you
're
a
going
in
to
win
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Chicken
,
"
returned
Mr
Toots
,
"
explain
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
then
,
here
's
all
about
it
,
Master
,
"
said
the
Chicken
.
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
a
cove
to
chuck
a
word
away
.
<EOS>
Here
's
wot
<EOS>
it
is
.
<EOS>
Are
any
on
'em
to
be
doubled
up
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
the
Chicken
put
this
question
he
dropped
his
hat
,
made
a
dodge
and
a
feint
with
his
left
hand
,
hit
a
supposed
enemy
a
violent
blow
with
his
right
,
shook
his
head
smartly
,
and
recovered
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Master
,
"
said
the
Chicken
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
to
be
gammon
or
pluck
?
<EOS>
Which
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Chicken
,
"
returned
Mr
Toots
,
"
your
expressions
are
coarse
,
and
your
meaning
is
obscure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
,
I
tell
you
what
,
Master
,
"
said
the
Chicken
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
where
it
is
.
<EOS>
It
's
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
mean
,
Chicken
?
"
asked
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
said
the
Chicken
,
with
a
frightful
corrugation
of
his
broken
nose
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
Now
,
Master
!
<EOS>
Wot
!
<EOS>
When
you
could
go
and
blow
on
this
here
match

stiff

"
by
which
depreciatory
appellation
it
has
been
since
supposed
that
the
Game
One
intended
to
signify
Mr
Dombey
;
"
and
when
you
could
knock
the
winner
and
all
the
kit
of
'em
dead
out
o

wind
and
time
,
are
you
going

<EOS>
To
give
in

"
said
the
Chicken
,
with
contemptuous
emphasis
.
<EOS>
"
Wy
,
it
's
mean
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Chicken
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
severely
,
"
<EOS>
you
're
a
perfect
Vulture

<EOS>
Your
sentiments
are
atrocious

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
sentiments
is
Game
and
Fancy

"
returned
the
Chicken
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
wot
my
sentiments
is
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
abear
a
meanness

<EOS>
I
'm
afore

<EOS>
Wy

it

said
the
Chicken
,
with
increased
expression
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
's
where
it
is
.
<EOS>
It
's
mean

<EOS>
"
  
"
Chicken
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
You
disgust
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Master
,
"
returned
the
Chicken
,
putting
on
his
hat
,
"
there
's
a

on
us
,
then
.
<EOS>
Come

<EOS>
Here
's

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
Never

<EOS>
Give

let

go

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Chicken
,
"
returned
Mr
Toots
,
"
after
the
odious
sentiments
you
have
expressed
,
I
shall
be
glad
to
part
on
such
terms
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Done
then
,
"
said
the
Chicken
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
bargain
.
<EOS>
This
here
conduct
of
yourn
wo
n't
suit
my
book

Master

<EOS>
Wy
<EOS>
,
it
's
mean
,
"
said
the
Chicken
;
who
seemed
equally
unable
to
get
beyond
that
point
,
and
to
stop
short
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
's
where
it
is
;
it
's
mean
!
"
  
<EOS>
So
Mr
Toots
and
the
Chicken
agreed
to
part
on
this
incompatibility
of
moral
perception
;
and
Mr
Toots
lying
down
to
sleep
,
dreamed
happily
of
Florence
,
who
had
thought
of
him
as
her
friend
upon
the
last
night
of
her
maiden
life
,
and
who
had
sent
him
her
dear
love

Another
Wedding
 
MR

Miff
the
pew

are
early
at
their
posts

the
fine
church
where
Mr
Dombey
was
married

<EOS>
A
yellow

faced
old
gentleman
from
India
,
is
going
to
take
unto
himself
a
young
wife
this
morning
,
and
six
carriages
full
of
company
are
expected
,
and
Mrs
Miff
has
been
informed
that
the
yellow

faced
old
gentleman
could
pave
the
road
to
church
with
diamonds

hardly
miss
them

<EOS>
The
nuptial
benediction
is
to
be

proceeding
from
a
very
reverend

a

is
to
be
given
away

as
an
extraordinary
present

by
somebody
who
comes
express
from
the
Horse
Guards

<EOS>
Mrs
Miff
is
more
intolerant
of
common
people
this
morning
,
than
she
generally
is
;
and
she
has
always
strong
opinions
on
that
subject
,
for
it
is
associated
with
free
sittings
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Miff
is
not
a
student

<EOS>
she
can
never
understand
what
business
your
common
folks
have
to
be
married
.
<EOS>
"
Drat

"
says
Mrs
Miff
,
"
you
read
the
same
things
over
'em

instead

get
sixpences

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Sownds
<EOS>
the
beadle
is
more
liberal
than
Mrs
Miff
---
but
then
he
is
nor
a
pew
-
opener
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
done
,
ma'am
,
"
he
says
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
marry
'em
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
our
national
schools
to
walk
at
the
head
of
,
and
we
must
have
our
standing
armies
.
<EOS>
We
must
marry'em
,
ma'am
,
"
says
Mr
Sownds
,
"
and
keep
the
country
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Sownds
is
sitting
on
the
steps
and
Mrs
Miff
is
dusting
in
the
church
,
when
a
young
couple
,
plainly
dressed
,
come
in
.
<EOS>
The
mortified
bonnet
of
Mrs
Miff
is
sharply
turned
towards
them
,
for
she
espies
in
this
early
visit
indications
of
a
runaway
match
.
<EOS>
But
they
do
n't
want
to
be
married
---
"
Only
,
"
says
the
gentleman
,
"
to
walk
round
the
church
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
as
he
slips
a
genteel
compliment
into
the
palm
of
Mrs
Miff
,
her
vinegary
face
relaxes
,
and
her
mortified
bonnet
and
her
spare
dry
figure
dip
and
crackle
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Miff
resumes
her
dusting
and
plumps
up
her
cushions
---
for
the
yellow
-
faced
old
gentleman
is
reported
to
have
tender
knees
---
but
keeps
her
glazed
,
pew
-
opening
eye
on
the
young
couple
who
are
walking
round
the
church
.
<EOS>
"
Ahem
,
"
coughs
Mrs
Miff
,
whose
cough
is
drier
than
the
hay
in
any
hassock
in
her
charge
,
"
you
'll
come
to
us
one
of
these
mornings
,
my
dears
,
unless
I
'm
much
mistaken
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
are
looking
at
a
tablet
on
the
wall
,
erected
to
the
memory
of
some
one
dead
.
<EOS>
They
are
a
long
way
off
from
Mrs
Miff
,
but
Mrs
Miff
can
see
with
half
an
eye
how
she
is
leaning
on
his
arm
,
and
how
his
head
is
bent
down
over
her
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
"
says
Mrs
Miff
,
"
you
might
do
worse
.
<EOS>
For
you
're
a
tidy
pair
!
"
  
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
personal
in
Mrs
Miff
's
remark
.
<EOS>
She
merely
speaks
of
stock
-
in
-
trade
.
<EOS>
She
is
hardly
more
curious
in
couples
than
in
coffins
.
<EOS>
She
is
such
a
spare
,
straight
,
dry
old
lady
---
such
a
pew
of
a
woman
---
that
you
should
find
as
many
individual
sympathies
in
a
ship
.
<EOS>
Mr
Sownds
,
now
,
who
is
fleshy
,
and
has
scarlet
in
his
coat
,
is
of
a
different
temperament
.
<EOS>
He
says
,
as
they
stand
upon
the
steps
watching
the
young
couple
away
,
that
she
has
a
pretty
figure
,
has
n't
she
,
and
as
well
as
he
could
se
(
for
she
held
her
head
down
coming
out
)
,
an
uncommon
pretty
face
.
"
<EOS>
Altogether
,
Mrs
Miff
,
"
says
Mr
Sownds
with
a
relish
,
"
she
is
what
you
may
call
a
rose
-
bud
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Miff
assents
with
a
spare
nod
of
her
mortified
bonnet
;
but
approves
of
this
so
little
,
<EOS>
that
she
inwardly
resolves
she
would
n't
be
the
wife
of
Mr
Sownds
for
any
money
he
could
give
her
,
Beadle
as
he
is
.
  
<EOS>
And
what
are
the
young
couple
saying
as
they
leave
the
church
,
and
go
out
at
the
gate
?
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Walter
,
thank
you
!
<EOS>
I
can
go
away
,
now
,
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
we
come
back
,
Florence
,
we
will
come
and
see
his
grave
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
lifts
her
eyes
,
so
bright
with
tears
,
to
his
kind
face
;
and
clasps
her
disengaged
hand
on
that
other
modest
little
hand
which
clasps
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
early
,
Walter
,
and
<EOS>
the
streets
are
almost
empty
yet
.
<EOS>
Let
us
walk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
be
so
tired
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
!
<EOS>
I
was
very
tired
the
first
time
that
we
ever
walked
together
,
but
I
shall
not
be
so
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
thus
---
not
much
changed
<EOS>
---
she
,
as
innocent
and
earnest
-
hearted
---
he
,
as
frank
,
as
hopeful
,
and
more
proud
of
her
---
Florence
and
Walter
,
on
their
bridal
morning
,
walk
through
the
streets
together
.
  
<EOS>
Not
even
in
that
childish
walk
of
long
ago
,
were
they
so
far
removed
from
all
the
world
about
them
as
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
The
childish
feet
of
long
ago
,
did
not
tread
such
enchanted
ground
as
theirs
do
now
.
<EOS>
The
confidence
and
love
of
children
may
be
given
many
times
,
and
will
spring
up
in
many
places
;
but
the
woman
's
heart
of
Florence
,
with
its
undivided
treasure
,
can
be
yielded
only
once
,
and
under
slight
or
change
,
can
only
droop
and
die
.
  
<EOS>
They
take
the
streets
that
are
the
quietest
,
and
do
not
go
near
that
in
which
her
old
home
stands
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
fair
,
warm
summer
morning
,
and
the
sun
shines
on
them
,
as
they
walk
towards
the
darkening
mist
that
overspreads
the
City
.
<EOS>
Riches
are
uncovering
in
shops
;
jewels
,
gold
,
and
silver
flash
in
the
goldsmith
's
sunny
windows
;
and
great
houses
cast
a
stately
shade
upon
them
as
they
pass
.
<EOS>
But
through
the
light
,
and
through
the
shade
,
they
go
on
lovingly
together
,
lost
to
everything
around
;
thinking
of
no
other
riches
,
and
no
prouder
home
,
than
they
have
now
in
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
Gradually
they
come
into
the
darker
,
narrower
streets
,
where
the
sun
,
now
yellow
,
and
now
red
,
is
seen
through
the
mist
,
only
at
street
corners
,
and
in
small
open
spaces
where
there
is
a
tree
,
or
one
of
the
innumerable
churches
,
or
a
paved
way
and
a
flight
of
steps
,
or
a
curious
little
patch
of
garden
,
or
a
burying
-
ground
,
where
the
few
tombs
and
tombstones
are
almost
black
.
<EOS>
Lovingly
and
trustfully
,
through
all
the
narrow
yards
and
alleys
and
the
shady
streets
,
Florence
goes
,
clinging
to
his
arm
,
to
be
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Her
heart
beats
quicker
now
,
for
Walter
tells
her
that
their
church
is
very
near
.
<EOS>
They
pass
a
few
great
stacks
of
ware
-
houses
,
with
waggons
at
the
doors
,
and
busy
carmen
stopping
up
the
way
---
but
Florence
does
not
see
or
hear
them
---
and
then
the
air
is
quiet
,
and
the
day
is
darkened
,
and
she
is
trembling
in
a
church
which
has
a
strange
smell
like
a
cellar
.
  
<EOS>
The
Shabby
little
old
man
,
ringer
of
the
disappointed
bell
,
is
standing
in
the
porch
,
and
has
put
his
hat
in
the
font
---
for
he
is
quite
at
home
there
,
being
sexton
.
<EOS>
He
ushers
them
into
an
old
brown
,
panelled
,
dusty
vestry
,
like
a
corner
-
cupboard
with
the
shelves
taken
out
;
where
the
wormy
registers
diffuse
a
smell
like
faded
snuff
,
which
has
set
the
tearful
Nipper
sneezing
.
  
<EOS>
Youthful
,
and
how
beautiful
,
the
young
bride
looks
,
in
this
old
dusty
place
,
with
no
kindred
object
near
her
but
her
husband
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
dusty
old
clerk
,
who
keeps
a
sort
of
evaporated
news
shop
underneath
an
archway
opposite
,
behind
a
perfect
fortification
of
posts
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
dusty
old
pew
-
opener
who
only
keeps
herself
,
and
finds
that
quite
enough
to
do
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
dusty
old
beadle
(
these
are
Mr
Toots
's
beadle
and
pew
-
opener
of
last
Sunday
)
,
who
has
something
to
do
with
a
Worshipful
Company
who
have
got
a
Hall
in
the
Next
yard
,
with
a
stained
-
glass
window
in
it
that
no
mortal
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
There
are
dusty
wooden
ledges
and
cornices
poked
in
and
out
over
the
altar
,
and
over
the
screen
and
round
the
gallery
,
and
over
the
inscription
about
what
the
Master
and
Wardens
of
the
Worshipful
Company
did
in
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
ninety
-
four
.
<EOS>
There
are
dusty
old
sounding
-
boards
over
the
pulpit
and
reading
-
desk
,
looking
like
lids
to
be
let
down
on
the
officiating
ministers
,
in
case
of
their
giving
offence
.
<EOS>
There
is
every
possible
provision
for
the
accommodation
of
dust
,
except
in
the
churchyard
,
where
the
facilities
in
that
respect
are
very
limited
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
Uncle
Sol
,
and
Mr
Toots
are
come
;
the
clergyman
is
putting
on
his
surplice
in
the
vestry
,
while
the
clerk
walks
round
him
,
blowing
the
dust
off
it
;
and
the
bride
and
bridegroom
stand
before
the
altar
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
brides
-
maid
,
unless
Susan
Nipper
is
one
;
and
no
better
father
than
Captain
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
A
man
with
a
wooden
leg
,
chewing
a
faint
apple
and
carrying
a
blue
bag
in
his
hand
,
looks
in
to
see
what
is
going
on
;
but
finding
it
nothing
entertaining
,
stumps
off
again
,
and
pegs
his
way
among
the
echoes
out
of
doors
.
  
<EOS>
No
gracious
ray
of
light
is
seen
to
fall
on
Florence
,
kneeling
at
the
altar
with
her
timid
head
bowed
down
.
<EOS>
The
Morning
luminary
is
built
out
,
and
do
n't
shine
there
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
meagre
tree
outside
,
where
the
sparrows
are
chirping
a
little
;
and
there
is
a
blackbird
in
an
eyelet
-
hole
of
sun
in
a
dyer
's
garret
,
over
against
the
window
,
who
whistles
loudly
whilst
the
service
is
performing
;
and
there
is
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
stumping
away
.
<EOS>
The
amens
of
the
dusty
clerk
appear
,
like
MacBeth
's
,
to
stick
in
his
throat
a
little
;
but
Captain
Cuttle
helps
him
out
,
and
does
it
with
so
much
goodwill
that
he
interpolates
three
entirely
new
responses
of
that
word
,
never
introduced
into
the
service
before
.
   
<EOS>
They
are
married
,
and
have
signed
their
names
in
one
of
the
old
sneezy
registers
,
and
the
clergyman
's
surplice
is
restored
to
the
dust
,
and
the
clergyman
is
gone
home
.
<EOS>
In
a
dark
corner
of
the
dark
church
,
Florence
has
turned
to
Susan
Nipper
,
and
is
weeping
in
her
arms
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
's
eyes
are
red
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
lubricates
his
nose
.
<EOS>
Uncle
Sol
has
pulled
down
his
spectacles
from
his
forehead
,
and
walked
out
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
Susan
;
dearest
Susan
!
<EOS>
If
you
ever
can
bear
witness
to
the
love
I
have
for
Walter
,
and
the
reason
that
I
have
to
love
him
,
do
it
for
his
sake
.
<EOS>
Good

bye

<EOS>
Good

"
  
<EOS>
They
have
thought
it
better
not
to
go
back
to
the
Midshipman
,
but
to
part
so
;
a
coach
is
waiting
for
them
,
near
at
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Nipper
can
not
speak
;
she
only
sobs
and
chokes
,
and
hugs
her
mistress
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
advances
,
urges
her
to
cheer
up
,
and
takes
charge
of
her
.
<EOS>
Florence
gives
him
her
hand
---
gives
him
,
in
the
fulness
of
her
heart
,
her
lips
---
kisses
Uncle
Sol
,
and
Captain
Cuttle
,
and
is
borne
away
by
her
young
husband
.
  
<EOS>
But
Susan
can
not
bear
that
Florence
should
go
away
with
a
mournful
recollection
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
meant
to
be
so
different
,
that
she
reproaches
herself
bitterly
.
<EOS>
Intent
on
making
one
last
effort
to
redeem
her
character
,
she
breaks
from
Mr
Toots
and
runs
away
to
find
the
coach
,
and
show
a
parting
smile
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
divining
her
object
,
sets
off
after
her
;
for
he
feels
it
<EOS>
his
duty
also
to
dismiss
them
with
a
cheer
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
Uncle
Sol
and
Mr
Toots
are
left
behind
together
,
outside
the
church
,
to
wait
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
coach
is
gone
,
but
the
street
is
steep
,
and
narrow
,
and
blocked
up
,
and
Susan
can
see
it
at
a
stand
-
still
in
the
distance
,
she
is
sure
.
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
follows
her
as
she
flies
down
the
hill
,
and
waves
his
glazed
hat
as
a
general
signal
,
which
may
attract
the
right
coach
and
which
may
not
.
  
<EOS>
Susan
outstrips
the
Captain
,
and
comes
up
with
it
.
<EOS>
She
looks
in
at
the
window
,
sees
Walter
,
with
the
gentle
face
beside
him
,
and
claps
her
hands
and
screams
:
  
"
Miss
Floy
,
my
darling

<EOS>
look
at
me
!
<EOS>
We
are
all
so
happy

<EOS>
One

good

"
  
<EOS>
How
Susan
does
it
,
she
do
n't
know
,
but
she
reaches
to
the
window
,
kisses
her
,
and
has
her
arms
about
her
neck
,
in
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
We

all

so
happy

says
Susan

with
a
suspicious
catching
in
her
breath

<EOS>
"
You

angry

Now

exclaims
Susan

here

What
with
the
young
husband
at
one
window
,
and
the
young
wife
at
the
other
;
the
Captain
hanging
on
at
this
door
,
and
Susan
Nipper
holding
fast
by
that
;
the
coach
obliged
to
go
on
whether
it
will
or
no
,
and
all
the
other
carts
and
coaches
turbulent
because
it
hesitates
;
there
never
was
so
much
confusion
on
four
wheels
.
<EOS>
But
Susan
Nipper
gallantly
maintains
her
point
.
<EOS>
She
keeps
a
smiling
face
upon
her
mistress
,
smiling
through
her
tears
,
until
the
last
.
<EOS>
Even
when
she
is
left
behind
,
the
Captain
continues
to
appear
and
disappear
at
the
door
,
crying
"
Hooroar
,
my
lad
!
<EOS>
Hooroar
,
my
Heart
's
Delight
!
"
<EOS>
with
his
shirt
-
collar
in
a
violent
state
of
agitation
,
until
it
is
hopeless
to
attempt
to
keep
up
with
the
coach
any
longer
.
<EOS>
Finally
,
when
the
coach
is
gone
,
Susan
Nipper
,
being
rejoined
by
the
Captain
,
falls
into
a
state
of
insensibility
,
and
is
taken
into
a
baker
's
shop
to
recover
.
  
<EOS>
Uncle
Sol
and
Mr
Toots
wait
patiently
in
the
churchyard
,
sitting
on
the
coping
-
stone
of
the
railings
,
until
Captain
Cuttle
and
Susan
come
back
.
<EOS>
Neither
being
at
all
desirous
to
speak
,
or
to
be
spoken
to
,
they
are
excellent
company
,
and
quite
satisfied
.
<EOS>
When
they
all
arrive
again
at
the
little
Midshipman
,
and
sit
down
to
breakfast
,
nobody
can
touch
a
morsel
.
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
makes
a
feint
of
being
voracious
about
toast
,
but
gives
it
up
as
a
swindle
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
says
,
after
breakfast
,
he
will
come
back
in
the
evening
;
and
goes
wandering
about
the
town
all
day
,
with
a
vague
sensation
upon
him
as
if
he
had
n't
been
to
bed
for
a
fortnight
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
strange
charm
in
the
house
,
and
in
the
room
,
in
which
they
have
been
used
to
be
together
,
and
out
of
which
so
much
is
gone
.
<EOS>
It
aggravates
,
and
yet
it
soothes
,
the
sorrow
of
the
separation
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
tells
Susan
Nipper
when
he
comes
at
night
,
that
he
has
n't
been
so
wretched
all
day
long
,
and
yet
he
likes
it
.
<EOS>
He
confides
in
Susan
Nipper
,
being
alone
with
her
,
and
tells
her
what
his
feelings
were
when
she
gave
him
that
candid
opinion
as
to
the
probability
of
Miss
Dombey
's
ever
loving
him
.
<EOS>
In
the
vein
of
confidence
engendered
by
these
common
recollections
,
and
their
tears
,
Mr
Toots
proposes
that
they
shall
go
out
together
,
and
buy
something
for
supper
.
<EOS>
Miss
Nipper
assenting
,
they
buy
a
good
many
little
things
;
and
,
with
the
aid
of
Mrs
Richards
,
set
the
supper
out
quite
showily
before
the
Captain
and
old
Sol
came
home
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
and
old
Sol
have
been
on
board
the
ship
,
and
have
established
Di
there
,
and
have
seen
the
chests
put
aboard
.
<EOS>
They
have
much
to
tell
about
the
popularity
of
Walter
,
and
the
comforts
he
will
have
about
him
,
and
the
quiet
way
in
which
it
seems
he
has
been
working
early
and
late
,
to
make
his
cabin
what
the
Captain
calls
"
a
picter
,
"
to
surprise
his
little
wife
.
<EOS>
"
A
admiral
's
cabin
,
mind
you
,
"
says
the
Captain
,
"
ai
n't
more
trim
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
one
of
the
Captain
's
chief
delights
is
,
that
he
knows
the
big
watch
,
and
the
sugar
-
tongs
,
and
tea
-
spoons
,
are
on
board
:
and
again
and
again
he
murmurs
to
himself
,
"
Ed'ard
<EOS>
Cuttle
,
my
lad
,
you
never
shaped
a
better
course
in
your
life
than
when
you
made
that
there
little
property
over
jintly
.
<EOS>
You
see
how
the
land
bore
,
Ed'ard
,
"
says
the
Captain
,
"
and
it
does
you
credit
,
my
lad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
Instrument
-
maker
is
more
distraught
and
misty
than
he
used
to
be
,
and
takes
the
marriage
and
the
parting
very
much
to
heart
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
greatly
comforted
by
having
his
old
ally
,
Ned
Cuttle
,
at
his
side
;
and
he
sits
down
to
supper
with
a
grateful
and
contented
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
boy
has
been
preserved
and
thrives
,
"
says
old
Sol
Gills
,
rubbing
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
right
have
I
to
be
otherwise
than
thankful
and
happy
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
who
has
not
yet
taken
his
seat
at
the
table
,
but
who
has
been
fidgeting
about
for
some
time
,
and
now
stands
hesitating
in
his
place
,
looks
doubtfully
at
Mr
Gills
,
and
says
:
  
"
Sol
!
<EOS>
There
's
the
last
bottle
of
the
old
Madeira
down
below

<EOS>
Would
you
wish

have
it
up
to

night

my

Wal'r

The
Instrument

looking
wistfully
at
the
Captain
,
puts
his
hand
into
the
breast

pocket
of
his

brings
forth
his
pocket

out

if
an
hour
should
come

it
will
comfort
you

believe
that
Florence
has
some
one
ever
near
her

the
great
charge
of
whose
life
is
to
cancel
her
remembrance
of
past

solemnly

in

Susan

Mr
Toots
are
of
the
same
opinion
.
<EOS>
After
a
silence
they
all
sit
down
to
supper
,
and
drink
to
the
young
husband
and
wife
in
something
else
;
and
the
last
bottle
of
the

Madeira
still
remains
among
its
dust
and
cobwebs
,
undisturbed

A
few
days
have
elapsed
,
and
a
stately
ship
is
out
at
sea
,
spreading
its
white
wings
to
the
favouring
wind

Upon

something

beautiful

something
that
it
is
good
and
pleasant
to
have
there
,
and
that
should
make
the
voyage
prosperous

is
Florence
.
<EOS>
It
is
night
,
and
she
and
Walter
sit
alone
,
watching
the
solemn
path
of
light
upon
the
sea
between
them
and
the
moon
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
she
can
not
see
it
plainly
,
for
the
tears
that
fill
her
eyes
;
and
then
she
lays
her
head
down
on
his
breast

puts
her
arms
around
his
neck

saying
,
"
Oh

I

so
happy

Her
husband
holds
her
to
his
heart

they
are
very
quiet

the
stately
ship
goes
on
serenely

<EOS>
"
As
I
hear
the

"
says
Florence

"
and
sit
watching

it

many

eternal

not
bounded
by

Chapter

<EOS>
After
a
Lapse
 
<EOS>
THE
sea
had
ebbed
and
flowed
,
through
a
whole
year
.
<EOS>
Through
a
whole
year
,
the
winds
and
clouds
had
come
and
gone
;
the
ceaseless
work
of
Time
had
been
performed
,
in
storm
and
sunshine
.
<EOS>
Through
a
whole
year
,
the
tides
of
human
chance
and
change
had
set
in
their
allotted
courses
.
<EOS>
Through
a
whole
year
,
the
famous
House
of
Dombey
and
Son
had
fought
a
fight
for
life
,
against
cross
accidents
,
doubtful
rumours
,
unsuccessful
ventures
,
unpropitious
times
,
and
most
of
all
,
against
the
infatuation
of
its
head
,
who
would
not
contract
its
enterprises
by
a
hair
's
breadth
,
and
would
not
listen
to
a
word
of
warning
that
the
ship
he
strained
so
hard
against
the
storm
,
was
weak
,
and
could
not
bear
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
year
was
out
,
and
the
great
House
was
down
.
  
<EOS>
One
summer
afternoon
;
a
year
,
wanting
some
odd
days
,
after
the
marriage
in
the
City
church
;
there
was
a
buzz
and
whisper
upon
'
Change
of
a
great
failure
.
<EOS>
A
certain
cold
proud
man
,
well
known
there
,
was
not
there
,
nor
was
he
represented
there
.
<EOS>
Next
day
it
was
noised
abroad
that
Dombey
and
Son
had
stopped
,
and
next
night
there
was
a
List
of
Bankrupts
published
,
headed
by
that
name
.
  
<EOS>
The
world
was
very
busy
now
,
in
sooth
,
and
had
a
deal
to
say
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
innocently
credulous
and
a
much
ill
-
used
world
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
world
in
which
there
was
no
other
sort
of
bankruptcy
whatever
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
conspicuous
people
in
it
,
trading
far
and
wide
on
rotten
banks
of
religion
,
patriotism
,
virtue
,
honour
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
amount
worth
mentioning
of
mere
paper
in
circulation
,
on
which
anybody
lived
pretty
handsomely
,
promising
to
pay
great
sums
of
goodness
with
no
effects
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
shortcomings
anywhere
,
in
anything
but
money
.
<EOS>
The
world
was
very
angry
indeed
;
and
the
people
especially
,
who
,
in
a
worse
world
,
might
have
been
supposed
to
be
bankrupt
traders
themselves
in
shows
and
pretences
,
were
observed
to
be
mightily
indignant
.
  
<EOS>
Here
was
a
new
inducement
to
dissipation
,
presented
to
that
sport
of
circumstances
,
Mr
Perch
the
Messenger
!
<EOS>
It
was
apparently
the
fate
of
Mr
Perch
to
be
always
waking
up
,
and
finding
himself
famous
.
<EOS>
He
had
but
yesterday
,
as
one
might
say
,
subsided
into
private
life
from
the
celebrity
of
the
elopement
and
the
events
that
followed
it
;
and
now
he
was
made
a
more
important
man
than
ever
,
by
the
bankruptcy
.
<EOS>
Gliding
from
his
bracket
in
the
outer
office
where
he
now
sat
,
watching
the
strange
faces
of
accountants
and
others
,
who
quickly
superseded
nearly
all
the
old
clerks
,
Mr
Perch
had
but
to
show
himself
in
the
court
outside
,
or
,
at
farthest
,
in
the
bar
of
the
King
's
Arms
,
to
be
asked
a
multitude
of
questions
,
almost
certain
to
include
that
interesting
question
,
what
would
he
take
to
drink
?
<EOS>
Then
would
Mr
Perch
descant
upon
the
hours
of
acute
uneasiness
he
and
Mrs
Perch
had
suffered
out
at
Balls
Pond
,
when
they
first
suspected
"
things
was
going
wrong
.
"
<EOS>
Then
would
Mr
Perch
relate
to
gaping
listeners
,
in
a
low
voice
,
as
if
the
corpse
of
the
deceased
House
were
lying
unburied
in
the
next
room
,
how
Mrs
Perch
had
first
come
to
surmise
that
things
was
going
wrong
by
hearing
him
(
Perch
)
moaning
in
his
sleep
,
"
twelve
and
ninepence
in
the
pound
,
twelve
and
ninepence
in
the
pound
!
"
<EOS>
Which
act
of
somnambulism
he
supposed
to
have
originated
in
the
impression
made
upon
him
by
the
change
in
Mr
Dombey
's
face
.
<EOS>
Then
would
he
inform
them
how
he
had
once
said
,
"
Might
I
make
so
bold
as
ask
,
Sir
,
are
you
unhappy
in
your
mind
?
"
<EOS>
and
how
Mr
Dombey
had
replied
,
"
<EOS>
My
faithful
Perch
---
<EOS>
but
no
,
it
can
not
be
!
"
<EOS>
and
with
that
had
struck
his
hand
upon
his
forehead
,
and
said
,
"
Leave
me
,
Perch
!
"
<EOS>
Then
,
in
short
,
would
Mr
Perch
,
a
victim
to
his
position
,
tell
all
manner
of
lies
;
affecting
himself
to
tears
by
those
that
were
of
a
moving
nature
,
and
really
believing
that
the
inventions
of
yesterday
had
,
on
repetition
,
a
sort
of
truth
about
them
to
-
day
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Perch
always
closed
these
conferences
by
meekly
remarking
,
That
,
of
course
,
whatever
his
suspicions
might
have
been
(
as
if
he
had
ever
had
any
!
)
<EOS>
it
was
n't
for
him
to
betray
his
trust
,
was
it
?
<EOS>
Which
sentiment
(
there
never
being
any
creditors
present
)
was
received
as
doing
as
doing
great
honour
to
his
feelings
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
he
generally
brought
away
a
soothed
conscience
and
left
an
agreeable
impression
behind
him
,
when
he
returned
to
his
bracket
:
again
to
sit
watching
the
strange
faces
of
the
accountants
and
others
,
making
so
free
with
the
great
mysteries
,
the
Books
;
or
now
and
then
to
go
on
tiptoe
into
Mr
Dombey
's
empty
room
,
and
stir
the
fire
;
or
to
take
an
airing
at
the
door
,
and
have
a
little
more
doleful
chat
with
any
straggler
whom
he
knew
;
or
to
propitiate
,
with
various
small
attentions
,
the
head
accountant
:
from
whom
Mr
Perch
had
expectations
of
a
messengership
in
a
Fire
Office
,
when
the
affairs
of
the
House
should
be
wound
up
.
  
<EOS>
To
Major
Bagstock
,
the
bankruptcy
was
quite
a
calamity
.
<EOS>
The
Major
was
not
a
sympathetic
character
---
his
attention
being
wholly
concentrated
on
JB
---
nor
was
he
a
man
subject
to
lively
emotions
,
except
in
the
physical
regards
of
gasping
and
choking
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
so
paraded
his
friend
Dombey
at
the
club
;
had
so
flourished
him
at
the
heads
of
the
members
in
general
,
and
so
put
them
down
by
continual
assertion
of
his
riches
;
that
the
club
,
being
but
human
,
was
delighted
to
retort
upon
the
Major
,
by
asking
him
,
with
a
show
of
great
concern
,
whether
this
tremendous
smash
had
been
at
all
expected
,
and
how
his
friend
Dombey
bore
it
.
<EOS>
To
such
questions
,
the
Major
,
waxing
very
purple
,
would
reply
that
it
was
a
bad
world
,
Sir
,
altogether
;
that
Joey
knew
a
thing
or
two
,
but
had
been
done
,
Sir
,
done
like
an
infant
;
that
if
you
had
foretold
this
,
Sir
,
to
J
Bagstock
,
when
he
went
abroad
with
Dombey
and
was
chasing
that
vagabond
up
and
down
France
,
J
Bagstock
would
have
pooh
-
pooh'd
you
---
would
have
pooh
-
pooh'd
<EOS>
you
,
Sir
,
by
the
Lord
!
<EOS>
That
Joe
had
been
deceived
,
Sir
,
taken
in
,
hoodwinked
,
blindfolded
,
but
was
broad
awake
again
and
staring
;
insomuch
,
Sir
,
that
if
Joe
's
father
were
to
rise
up
from
the
grave
to
-
morrow
,
he
would
n't
trust
the
old
blade
with
a
penny
piece
,
but
would
tell
him
that
his
son
Josh
was
too
old
a
soldier
to
be
done
again
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
That
he
was
a
suspicious
,
crabbed
,
cranky
,
used
-
up
,
JB
infidel
,
Sir
;
and
that
if
it
were
consistent
with
the
dignity
of
a
rough
and
tough
old
Major
,
of
the
old
school
,
who
had
had
the
honour
of
being
personally
known
to
,
and
commended
by
,
their
late
Royal
Highnesses
the
Dukes
of
Kent
and
York
,
to
retire
to
a
tub
and
live
in
it
,
by
Gad
!
<EOS>
Sir
,
he
'd
have
a
tub
in
Pall
Mall
to
-
morrow
,
to
show
his
contempt
for
mankind
!
  
<EOS>
Of
all
this
,
and
many
variations
of
the
same
tune
,
the
Major
would
deliver
himself
with
so
many
apoplectic
symptoms
,
such
rollings
of
his
head
,
and
such
violent
growls
of
ill
usage
and
resentment
,
that
the
younger
members
of
the
club
surmised
he
had
invested
money
in
his
friend
Dombey
's
House
,
and
lost
it
;
though
the
older
soldiers
and
deeper
dogs
,
who
knew
Joe
better
,
would
n't
hear
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
Native
,
expressing
no
opinion
,
suffered
dreadfully
;
not
merely
in
his
moral
feelings
,
which
were
regularly
fusilladed
by
the
Major
every
nour
in
the
day
,
and
riddled
through
and
through
,
but
in
his
sensitiveness
to
bodily
knocks
and
bumps
,
which
was
kept
continually
on
the
stretch
.
<EOS>
For
six
entire
weeks
after
the
bankruptcy
,
this
miserable
foreigner
lived
in
a
rainy
season
of
boot
-
jacks
and
brushes
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
had
three
ideas
upon
the
subject
of
the
terrible
reverse
.
<EOS>
The
first
was
that
she
could
not
understand
it
.
<EOS>
The
second
,
that
her
brother
had
not
made
an
effort
.
<EOS>
The
third
,
that
if
she
had
been
invited
to
dinner
on
the
day
of
that
first
party
,
it
never
would
have
happened
;
and
that
she
had
said
so
,
at
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
Nobody
's
opinion
stayed
the
misfortune
,
lightened
it
,
or
made
it
heavier
.
<EOS>
It
was
understood
that
the
affairs
of
the
House
were
to
be
wound
up
as
they
best
could
be
;
that
Mr
Dombey
freely
resigned
everything
he
had
,
and
asked
for
no
favour
from
any
one
.
<EOS>
That
any
resumption
of
the
business
was
out
of
the
question
,
as
he
would
listen
to
no
friendly
negotiation
having
that
compromise
in
view
;
that
he
had
relinquished
every
post
of
trust
or
distinction
he
had
held
,
as
a
man
respected
among
merchants
;
that
he
was
dying
,
according
to
some
;
that
he
was
going
melancholy
mad
,
according
to
others
;
that
he
was
a
broken
man
,
according
to
all
.
  
<EOS>
The
clerks
dispersed
after
holding
a
little
dinner
of
condolence
among
themselves
,
which
was
enlivened
by
comic
singing
,
and
went
off
admirably
.
<EOS>
Some
took
places
abroad
,
and
some
engaged
in
other
Houses
at
home
;
some
looked
up
relations
in
the
country
,
for
whom
they
suddenly
remembered
they
had
a
particular
affection
;
and
some
advertised
for
employment
in
the
newspapers
.
<EOS>
Mr
Perch
alone
remained
of
all
the
late
establishment
,
sitting
on
his
bracket
looking
at
the
accountants
,
or
starting
off
it
,
to
propitiate
the
head
accountant
,
who
was
to
get
him
into
the
Fire
Office
.
<EOS>
The
Counting
House
soon
got
to
be
dirty
and
neglected
.
<EOS>
The
principal
slipper
and
dogs
'
collar
seller
,
at
the
corner
of
the
court
,
would
have
doubted
the
propriety
of
throwing
up
his
forefinger
to
the
brim
of
his
hat
,
any
more
,
if
Mr
Dombey
had
appeared
there
now
;
and
the
ticket
porter
,
with
his
hands
under
his
white
apron
,
moralised
good
sound
morality
about
ambition
,
which
(
he
observed
)
was
not
,
in
his
opinion
,
made
to
rhyme
to
perdition
,
for
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Morfin
,
the
hazel
-
eyed
bachelor
,
with
the
hair
and
whiskers
sprinkled
with
grey
,
was
perhaps
the
only
person
within
the
atmosphere
of
the
House
---
its
head
,
of
course
,
excepted
---
<EOS>
who
was
heartily
and
deeply
affected
by
the
disaster
that
had
befallen
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
treated
Mr
Dombey
with
due
respect
and
deference
through
many
years
,
but
he
had
never
disguised
his
natural
character
,
or
meanly
truckled
to
him
,
or
pampered
his
master
passion
for
the
advancement
of
his
own
purposes
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
therefore
,
no
self
-
disrespect
to
avenge
;
no
long
-
tightened
springs
to
release
with
a
quick
recoil
.
<EOS>
He
worked
early
and
late
to
unravel
whatever
was
complicated
or
difficult
in
the
records
of
the
transactions
of
the
House
;
was
always
in
attendance
to
explain
whatever
required
explanation
;
sat
in
his
old
room
sometimes
very
late
at
night
,
studying
points
by
his
mastery
of
which
he
could
spare
Mr
Dombey
the
pain
of
being
personally
referred
to
;
and
then
would
go
home
to
Islington
,
and
calm
his
mind
by
producing
the
most
dismal
and
forlorn
sounds
out
of
his
violoncello
before
going
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
solacing
himself
with
this
melodious
grumbler
one
evening
,
and
,
having
been
much
dispirited
by
the
proceedings
of
the
day
,
was
scraping
consolation
out
of
its
deepest
notes
,
when
his
landlady
(
who
was
fortunately
deaf
,
and
had
no
other
consciousness
of
these
performances
than
a
sensation
of
something
rumbling
in
her
bones
)
announced
a
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
mourning
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
The
violoncello
stopped
immediately
;
and
the
performer
,
laying
it
on
the
sofa
with
great
tenderness
and
care
,
made
a
sign
that
the
lady
was
to
come
in
.
<EOS>
He
followed
directly
,
and
met
Harriet
Carker
on
the
stair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alone
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
and
John
here
this
morning
!
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
the
matter
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
But
no
,
"
he
added
,
"
your
face
tells
quite
another
story
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
it
is
a
selfish
revelation
that
you
see
there
,
then
,
"
she
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
very
pleasant
one
,
"
said
he
;
"
and
,
if
selfish
,
a
novelty
too
,
worth
seeing
in
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
believe
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
placed
a
chair
for
her
by
this
time
,
and
sat
down
opposite
;
the
violoncello
lying
snugly
on
the
sofa
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
be
surprised
at
my
coming
alone
,
or
at
John
's
not
having
told
you
I
was
coming
,
"
said
Harriet
;
"
and
you
will
believe
that
,
when
I
tell
you
why
I
have
come
.
<EOS>
May
I
do
so
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
do
nothing
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
not
busy
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
pointed
to
the
violoncello
lying
on
the
sofa
,
and
said
,
"
I
have
been
,
all
day
.
<EOS>
Here
's
my
witness
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
confiding
all
my
cares
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
none
but
my
own
to
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Is
the
House
at
an
end
?
"
said
Harriet
,
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Completely
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
it
never
be
resumed
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
bright
expression
of
her
face
was
not
overshadowed
as
her
lips
silently
repeated
the
word
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
observe
this
with
some
little
involuntary
surprise
:
and
said
again
:
  
"
<EOS>
Never
.
<EOS>
You
remember
what
I
told
you
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
,
all
along
,
impossible
to
convince
him
;
impossible
to
reason
with
him
;
sometimes
,
impossible
even
to
approach
him
.
<EOS>
The
worst
has
happened
;
and
the
House
has
fallen
,
never
to
built
up
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
Mr
Dombey
,
is
he
personally
ruined
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ruined
.
"
<EOS>
"
Will
he
have
no
private
fortune
left
?
<EOS>
Nothing
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
certain
eagerness
in
her
voice
,
and
something
that
was
almost
joyful
in
her
look
,
seemed
to
surprise
him
more
and
more
;
to
disappoint
him
too
,
and
jar
discordantly
against
his
own
emotions
.
<EOS>
He
drummed
with
the
fingers
of
one
hand
on
the
table
,
looking
wistfully
at
her
,
and
shaking
his
head
,
said
,
after
a
pause
:
  
"
The
extent
of
Mr
Dombey
's
resources
is
not
accurately
within
my
knowledge
;
but
though
they
are
doubtless
very
large
,
his
obligations
are
enormous
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
gentleman
of
high
honour
and
integrity
.
<EOS>
Any
man
in
his
position
could
,
and
many
a
man
in
his
position
would
,
have
saved
himself
,
by
making
terms
which
would
have
very
slighty
,
almost
insensibly
,
increased
the
losses
of
those
who
had
had
dealings
with
him
,
and
left
him
a
remnant
to
live
upon
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
resolved
on
payment
to
the
last
farthing
of
his
means
.
<EOS>
His
own
words
are
,
that
they
will
clear
,
or
nearly
clear
,
the
House
,
and
that
no
one
can
lose
much
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
Miss
Harriet
,
it
would
do
us
no
harm
to
remember
oftener
than
we
do
,
that
vices
are
sometimes
only
virtues
carried
to
excess
!
<EOS>
His
pride
shows
well
in
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
heard
him
with
little
or
no
change
in
her
expression
,
and
with
a
divided
attention
that
showed
her
to
be
busy
with
something
in
her
own
mind
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
silent
,
she
asked
him
hurriedly
:
  
"
Have
you
seen
him
lately
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
one
sees
him
.
<EOS>
When
this
crisis
of
his
affairs
renders
it
necessary
for
him
to
come
out
of
his
house
,
he
comes
out
for
the
occasion
,
and
again
goes
home
,
and
shuts
himself
up
,
and
will
see
no
one
.
<EOS>
He
has
written
me
a
letter
,
acknowledging
our
past
connexion
in
higher
terms
than
it
deserved
,
and
parting
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
delicate
of
obtruding
myself
upon
him
now
,
never
having
had
much
intercourse
with
him
in
better
times
;
but
I
have
tried
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
have
written
,
gone
there
,
entreated
.
<EOS>
Quite
in
vain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
watched
her
,
as
in
the
hope
that
she
would
testify
some
greater
concern
than
she
had
yet
shown
;
and
spoke
gravely
and
feelingly
,
as
if
to
impress
her
the
more
;
but
there
was
no
change
in
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
Miss
Harriet
,
"
he
said
,
with
a
disappointed
air
,
"
this
is
not
to
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
come
here
to
hear
this
.
<EOS>
Some
other
and
pleasanter
theme
is
in
your
mind
.
<EOS>
Let
it
be
in
mine
,
too
,
and
we
shall
talk
upon
more
equal
terms
.
<EOS>
Come
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
is
the
same
theme
,
"
returned
Harriet
,
with
frank
and
quick
surprise
.
"
<EOS>
Is
it
not
likely
that
it
should
be
?
<EOS>
Is
it
not
natural
that
John
and
I
should
have
been
thinking
and
speaking
very
much
of
late
of
these
great
changes
?
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
whom
he
served
so
many
years
---
you
know
upon
what
terms
---
reduced
,
as
you
describe
;
and
we
quite
rich
!
"
  
<EOS>
Good
,
true
face
,
as
that
face
of
hers
was
,
and
pleasant
as
it
had
been
to
him
,
Mr
Morfin
,
the
hazel
-
eyed
bachelor
,
since
the
first
time
he
had
ever
looked
upon
it
,
it
pleased
him
less
at
that
moment
,
lighted
with
a
ray
of
exultation
,
than
it
had
ever
pleased
him
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
remind
you
,
"
said
Harriet
,
casting
down
her
eyes
upon
her
black
dress
,
"
through
what
means
our
circumstances
changed
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
forgotten
that
our
brother
James
,
upon
that
dreadful
day
,
left
no
will
,
no
relations
but
ourselves
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
face
was
pleasanter
to
him
now
,
though
it
was
pale
and
melancholy
,
than
it
had
been
a
moment
since
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
breathe
more
cheerily
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
"
she
said
,
"
our
history
,
the
history
of
both
my
brothers
,
in
connexion
with
the
unfortunate

unhappy
gentleman
,
of
whom
you
have
spoken
so
truly

You

how
few
our
wants
are

John
's
and
mine
---
and
what
little
use
we
have
for
money
,
after
the
life
we
have
led
together
for
so
many
years
;
and
now
that
he
is
earning
an
income
that
is
ample
for
us
,
through
your
kindness
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
unprepared
to
hear
what
favour
<EOS>
I
have
come
to
ask
of
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
.
<EOS>
I
was
,
a
minute
ago
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
think
,
I
am
not
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Of
my
dead
brother
I
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
If
the
dead
know
what
we
do
---
but
you
understand
me
.
<EOS>
Of
my
living
brother
I
could
say
much
:
but
what
need
I
say
more
,
than
that
this
act
of
duty
,
in
which
I
have
come
to
ask
your
indispensable
assistance
,
is
his
own
,
and
that
he
can
not
rest
until
it
is
performed
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
raised
her
eyes
again
;
and
the
light
of
exultation
in
her
face
begin
to
appear
beautiful
,
in
the
observant
eyes
that
watched
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
sir
,
"
she
went
on
to
say
,
"
It
must
be
done
very
quietly
and
secretly
.
<EOS>
Your
experience
and
knowledge
will
point
out
a
way
of
doing
it
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
may
,
perhaps
,
be
led
to
believe
that
it
is
something
saved
,
unexpectedly
,
from
the
wreck
of
his
fortunes
;
or
that
it
is
a
voluntary
tribute
to
his
honourable
and
upright
character
,
from
some
of
those
with
whom
he
has
had
great
dealings
;
or
that
it
is
some
old
lost
debt
repaid
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
many
ways
of
doing
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
choose
the
best
.
<EOS>
The
favour
I
have
come
to
ask
is
,
that
you
will
do
it
for
us
in
your
own
kind
,
generous
,
considerate
manner
.
<EOS>
That
you
will
never
speak
of
it
to
John
,
whose
chief
happiness
in
this
act
of
restitution
is
to
do
it
secretly
,
unknown
,
and
unapproved
of
:
that
only
a
very
small
part
of
the
inheritance
may
be
reserved
to
us
,
until
Mr
Dombey
shall
have
possessed
the
interest
of
the
rest
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
;
that
you
will
keep
our
secret
,
faithfully
---
but
that
I
am
sure
you
will
;
and
that
,
from
this
time
,
it
may
seldom
be
whispered
,
even
between
you
and
me
,
but
may
live
in
any
thoughts
only
as
a
new
reason
for
thankfulness
to
Heaven
,
and
joy
and
pride
in
my
brother
.
"
  
<EOS>
Such
a
look
of
exultation
there
may
be
on
Angels
'
faces
,
when
the
one
repentant
sinner
enters
Heaven
,
among
ninety
-
nine
just
men
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
dimmed
or
tarnished
by
the
joyful
tears
that
filled
her
eyes
,
but
was
the
brighter
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Harriet
,
"
said
Mr
Morfin
,
after
a
silence
,
"
I
was
not
prepared
for
this
.
<EOS>
Do
I
understand
you
that
you
wish
to
make
your
own
part
in
the
inheritance
available
for
your
good
purpose
,
as
well
as
John
's
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
she
returned
.
<EOS>
"
When
we
have
shared
everything
together
for
so
long
a
time
,
and
have
had
no
care
,
hope
,
or
purpose
apart
,
could
I
bear
to
be
excluded
from
my
share
in
this
?
<EOS>
May
I
not
urge
a
claim
to
be
my
brother
's
partner
and
companion
to
the
last
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Heaven
forbid
that
I
should
dispute
it
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
may
rely
on
your
friendly
help
?
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
we
might
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
a
worse
man
than
,

than
I
hope
I
am
,
or
would
willingly
believe
myself
,
if
I
could
not
give
you
that
assurance
from
my
heart

soul
.
<EOS>
You
may
,
implicitly
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
honour
,
I
will
keep
your
secret
.
<EOS>
And
if
it
should
be
found
that
Mr
Dombey
is
so
reduced
as
I
fear
he
will
be
,
acting
on
a
determination
that
there
seem
to
be
no
means
of
influencing
,
I
will
assist
you
to
accomplish
the
design
,
on
which
you
and
John
are
jointly
resolved
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
gave
him
her
hand
,
and
thanked
him
with
a
cordial
,
happy
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Harriet
,
"
he
said
,
detaining
it
in
his
.
"
<EOS>
To
speak
to
you
of
the
worth
of
any
sacrifice
that
you
can
make
now
---
above
all
,
of
any
sacrifice
of
mere
money
---
would
be
idle
and
presumptuous
.
<EOS>
To
put
before
you
any
appeal
to
reconsider
your
purpose
or
to
set
narrow
limits
to
it
,
would
be
,
I
feel
,
not
less
so
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
mar
the
great
end
of
a
great
history
,
by
any
obtrusion
of
my
own
weak
self
.
<EOS>
I
have
every
right
to
bend
my
head
before
what
you
confide
to
me
,
satisfied
that
it
comes
from
a
higher
and
better
source
of
inspiration
than
my
poor
worldly
knowledge
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
only
this
:
I
am
your
faithful
steward
;
and
I
would
rather
be
so
,
and
<EOS>
your
chosen
friend
,
than
I
would
be
anybody
in
the
world
,
except
yourself
.

"
  
<EOS>
She
thanked
him
again
,
cordially
,
and
wished
him
good
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
home
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
with
you
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
to

night

<EOS>
I
am
not
going
home
now
;
I
have
a
visit
to
make
alone

<EOS>
Will
you
come
to

morrow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
'll
come
to

morrow
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
I
'll
think
of
this
,
and
how
we
can
best
proceed
.
<EOS>
And
perhaps
you
'll
think
of
it
,
dear
Harriet
,
and
---
<EOS>
and

think
of
me
a
little
in
connexion
with
it

"
   
<EOS>
He
handed
her
down
to
a
coach
she
had
in
waiting
at
the
door
;
and
if
his
landlady
had
not
been
deaf
,
she
would
have
heard
him
muttering
as
he
went
back
upstairs
,
when
the
coach
had
driven
off
,
that
we
were
creatures
of
habit
,
and
it
was
a
sorrowful
habit
to
be
an
old
bachelor
.
  
<EOS>
The
violoncello
lying
on
the
sofa
between
the
two
chairs
,
he
took
it
up
,
without
putting
away
the
vacant
chair
,
and
sat
droning
on
it
,
and
slowly
shaking
his
head
at
the
vacant
chair
,
for
a
long
,
long
time
.
<EOS>
The
expression
he
communicated
to
the
instrument
at
first
,
though
monstrously
pathetic
and
bland
,
was
nothing
to
the
expression
he
communicated
to
this
own
face
,
and
bestowed
upon
the
empty
chair
:
which
was
so
sincere
,
that
he
was
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
Captain
Cuttle
's
remedy
more
than
once
,
and
to
rub
his
face
with
his
sleeve
.
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
however
,
the
violoncello
,
in
unison
with
his
own
frame
of
mind
,
glided
melodiously
into
the
Harmonious
Blacksmith
,
which
he
played
over
and
over
again
,
until
his
ruddy
and
serene
face
gleamed
like
true
metal
on
the
anvil
of
a
veritable
blacksmith
.
<EOS>
In
fine
,
the
violoncello
and
the
empty
chair
were
the
companions
of
his
bachelorhood
until
nearly
midnight
;
and
when
he
took
his
supper
,
the
violoncello
set
up
on
end
in
the
sofa
corner
,
big
with
the
latent
harmony
of
a
whole
foundry
full
of
harmonious
blacksmiths
,
seemed
to
ogle
the
empty
chair
out
of
its
crooked
eyes
,
with
unutterable
intelligence
.
  
<EOS>
When
Harriet
left
the
house
,
the
driver
of
her
hired
coach
,
taking
a
course
that
was
evidently
no
new
one
to
him
,
went
in
and
out
by
bye
-
ways
,
through
that
part
of
the
suburbs
,
until
he
arrived
at
some
open
ground
,
where
there
were
a
few
quiet
little
old
houses
standing
among
gardens
.
<EOS>
At
the
garden
-
gate
of
one
of
these
he
stopped
,
and
Harriet
alighted
.
  
<EOS>
Her
gentle
ringing
at
the
bell
was
responded
to
by
a
dolorous
-
looking
woman
,
of
light
complexion
,
with
raised
eyebrows
,
and
head
drooping
on
one
side
,
who
curtseyed
at
sight
of
her
,
and
conducted
her
across
the
garden
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
your
patient
,
nurse
,
to
-
night
?
"
said
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
a
poor
way
,
Miss
,
I
am
afraid
.
<EOS>
Oh
how
she
do
remind
me
,
sometimes
,
of
my
uncle
's
Betsey
Jane
!
<EOS>
"
returned
the
woman
of
the
light
complexion
,
in
a
sort
of
doleful
rapture
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
what
respect
?
"
asked
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
,
in
all
respects
,
"
replied
the
other
,
"
except
that
she
's
grown
up
,
and
Betsey
Jane
,
when
at
death
's
door
,
was
but
a
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
told
me
she
recovered
,
"
observed
Harriet
mildly
;
"
<EOS>
so
there
is
the
more
reason
for
hope
,
Mrs
Wickam
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
,
Miss
,
hope
is
an
excellent
thing
for
such
as
has
the
spirits
to
bear
it
!
"
said
Mrs
Wickam
,
shaking
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
My
own
spirits
is
not
equal
to
it
,
but
I
do
n't
owe
it
any
grudge
.
<EOS>
I
envys
them
that
is
so
blest
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
try
to
be
more
cheerful
,
"
remarked
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Miss
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
said
Mrs
Wickam
grimly
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
was
so
inclined
,
the
loneliness
of
this
situation
---
you
'll
excuse
my
speaking
so
free
---
would
put
it
out
of
my
power
in
four
and
twenty
hours
;
but
I
an't
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
not
.
<EOS>
The
little
spirits
that
I
ever
had
,
I
was
bereaved
of
at
Brighton
some
few
years
ago
,
and
I
think
I
feel
myself
the
better
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
truth
,
this
was
the
very
Mrs
Wickam
who
had
super
-
seded
Mrs
Richards
as
the
nurse
of
little
Paul
,
and
who
considered
herself
to
have
gained
the
loss
in
question
,
under
the
roof
of
the
amiable
Pipchin
.
<EOS>
The
excellent
and
thoughtful
old
system
,
hallowed
by
long
prescription
,
which
has
usually
picked
out
from
the
rest
of
mankind
the
most
dreary
and
uncomfortable
people
that
could
possibly
be
laid
hold
of
,
to
act
as
instructors
of
youth
,
finger
-
posts
to
the
virtues
,
matrons
,
monitors
,
attendants
on
sick
beds
,
and
the
like
,
had
established
Mrs
Wickam
in
very
good
business
as
a
nurse
,
and
had
led
to
her
serious
qualities
being
particularly
commended
by
an
admiring
and
numerous
connexion
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Wickam
,
with
her
eyebrows
elevated
,
and
her
head
on
one
side
,
lighted
the
way
up
stairs
to
a
clean
,
neat
chamber
,
opening
on
another
chamber
dimly
lighted
,
where
there
was
a
bed
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
room
,
an
old
woman
sat
mechanically
staring
out
at
the
open
window
,
on
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
In
the
second
,
stretched
upon
the
bed
,
lay
the
shadow
of
a
figure
that
had
spurned
the
wind
and
rain
,
one
wintry
night
;
hardly
to
be
recognised
now
,
but
by
the
long
black
hair
that
showed
so
very
black
against
the
colourless
face
,
and
all
the
white
things
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
strong
eyes
,
and
the
weak
frame
!
<EOS>
The
eyes
that
turned
so
eagerly
and
brightly
to
the
door
when
Harriet
came
in
;
the
feeble
head
that
could
not
raise
itself
,
and
moved
so
slowly
round
upon
its
pillow
!
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
!
"
said
the
visitor
's
mild
voice
,
"
am
I
late
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
always
seem
late
,
but
are
always
early
.
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
had
sat
down
by
the
bedside
now
,
and
put
her
hand
upon
the
thin
hand
lying
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
better
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Wickam
,
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
like
a
disconsolate
spectre
,
most
decidedly
and
forcibly
shook
her
head
to
negative
this
position
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
matters
very
little
!
"
<EOS>
said
Alice
,
with
a
faint
smile
.
<EOS>
"
Better
or
worse
to
-
day
,
is
but
a
day
's
difference
---
perhaps
not
so
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Wickam
,
as
a
serious
character
,
expressed
her
approval
with
a
groan
;
and
having
made
some
cold
dabs
at
the
bottom
of
the
bedclothes
,
as
feeling
for
the
patient
's
feet
and
expecting
to
find
them
stony
,
went
clinking
among
the
medicine
bottles
on
the
table
,
as
who
should
say
,
"
while
we
are
here
,
let
us
repeat
the
mixture
as
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Alice
,
whispering
to
her
visitor
,
"
evil
courses
,
and
remorse
,
travel
,
want
,
and
weather
,
storm
within
,
and
storm
without
,
have
worn
my
life
away
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
last
much
longer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
drew
the
hand
up
as
she
spike
,
and
laid
her
face
against
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
lie
here
,
sometimes
,
thinking
I
should
like
to
live
until
I
had
had
a
little
time
to
show
you
how
grateful
I
could
be
!
<EOS>
It
is
a
weakness
,
and
soon
passes
.
<EOS>
Better
for
you
as
it
is
.
<EOS>
Better
for
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
How
different
her
hold
upon
the
hand
,
from
what
it
had
been
when
she
took
it
by
the
fireside
on
the
bleak
winter
evening
!
<EOS>
Scorn
,
rage
,
defiance
,
recklessness
,
look
here
!
<EOS>
This
is
the
end
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Wickam
having
clinked
sufficiently
among
the
bottles
,
now
produced
the
mixture
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Wickam
looked
hard
at
her
patient
in
the
act
of
drinking
,
screwed
her
mouth
up
tight
,
her
eyebrows
also
,
and
shook
her
head
,
expressing
that
tortures
should
n't
make
her
say
it
was
a
hopeless
case
.

Mrs
Wickam
then
sprinkled
a
little
cooling
-
stuff
about
the
room
,
with
the
air
of
a
female
grave
-
digger
,
who
was
strewing
ashes
on
ashes
,
dust
on
dust
---
for
she
was
a
serious
character
---
and
withdrew
to
partake
of
certain
funeral
baked
meats
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
is
it
,
"
asked
Alice
,
"
Since
I
went
to
you
and
told
you
what
I
had
done
,
and
when
you
were
advised
it
was
too
late
for
any
one
to
follow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
year
and
more
,
"
said
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
year
and
more
,
"
said
Alice
,
thoughtfully
intent
upon
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
Months
upon
months
since
you
brought
me
here
!
"
  
Harriet
answered
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Brought
me
here
,
by
force
of
gentleness
and
kindness
.
<EOS>
Me
!
<EOS>
"
said
Alice
,
shrinking
with
her
face
behind
the
hand
,
"
and
made
me
human
by
woman
's
looks
and
words
,
and
angel
's
deeds
!
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
bending
over
her
,
composed
and
soothed
her
.
<EOS>
By
and
bye
,
Alice
lying
as
before
,
with
the
hand
against
her
face
,
asked
to
have
her
mother
called
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
called
to
her
more
than
once
,
but
the
old
woman
was
so
absorbed
looking
out
at
the
open
window
on
the
darkness
,
that
she
did
not
hear
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
Harriet
went
to
her
and
touched
her
,
that
she
rose
up
,
and
came
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
said
Alice
,
taking
the
hand
again
,
and
fixing
her
lustrous
eyes
lovingly
upon
her
visitor
,
while
she
merely
addressed
a
motion
of
her
finger
to
the
old
woman
,
"
tell
her
what
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
-
night
,
my
deary
?
"
  
"
Aye
,
mother
,
"
answered
Alice
,
faintly
and
solemnly
,
"
to
-
night
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
,
whose
wits
appeared
disordered
by
alarm
,
remorse
,
or
grief
,
came
creeping
along
the
side
of
the
bed
,
opposite
to
that
on
which
Harriet
sat
;
and
kneeling
down
,
so
as
to
bring
her
withered
face
upon
a
level
with
the
coverlet
,
and
stretching
out
her
hand
,
so
as
to
touch
her
daughter
's
arm
,
began
:
  
"
<EOS>
My
handsome
gal
---
"
  
Heaven
<EOS>
,
what
a
cry
was
that
,
with
which
she
stopped
there
,
gazing
at
the
poor
form
lying
on
the
bed
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Changed
,
long
ago
,
mother
!
<EOS>
Withered
,
long
ago
,
"
said
Alice
,
without
looking
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
grieve
for
that
now
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
---
My
daughter
,
"
faltered
the
old
woman
,
"
my
gal
who
'll
soon
get
better
,
and
shame
'em
all
with
her
good
looks
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
smiled
mournfully
at
Harriet
,
and
fondled
her
hand
a
little
closer
,
but
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
'll
soon
get
better
,
I
say
,
"
repeated
the
old
woman
,
menacing
the
vacant
air
with
her
shrivelled
fist
,
"
and
who
'll
shame
'em
all
with
her
good
looks
---
she
will
.
<EOS>
I
say
she
will!she
shall
!
"
<EOS>
---
as
if
she
were
in
passionate
contention
with
some
unseen
opponent
at
the
bedside
,
who
contradicted
her
---
"
my
daughter
has
been
turned
away
from
,
and
cast
out
,
but
she
could
boast
relationship
to
proud
folks
too
,
if
she
chose
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
To
proud
folks
!
<EOS>
There
's
relationship
without
your
clergy
and
your
wedding
rings
---
they
may
make
it
,
but
they
ca
n't
break
it
---
and
my
daughter
's
well
related
.
<EOS>
Show
me
Mrs
Dombey
,
and
I
'll
show
you
my
Alice
's
first
cousin
.

"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
glanced
from
the
old
woman
to
the
lustrous
eyes
intent
upon
her
face
,
and
derived
corroboration
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
cried
the
old
woman
,
her
nodding
head
bridling
with
a
ghastly
vanity
.
<EOS>
"
Though
I
am
old
an
ugly
now
,
---
much
older
by
life
and
habit
than
years
though
,
---
I
was
once
as
young
as
any
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
as
pretty
too
,
as
many
!
<EOS>
I
was
a
fresh
country
wench
in
my
time
,
darling
,
"
stretching
out
her
arm
to
Harriet
,
across
the
bed
,
"
and
looked
it
,
too
.
<EOS>
Down
in
my
country
,
Mrs
Dombey
's
father
and
his
brother
were
the
gayest
gentlemen
and
the
best
-
liked
that
came
a
visiting
from
London
<EOS>
---
they
have
long
been
dead
,
though
!
<EOS>
Lord
,
Lord
,
this
long
while
!
<EOS>
The
brother
,
who
was
my
Ally
's
father
,
longest
of
the
two
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
raised
her
head
a
little
,
and
peered
at
her
daughter
's
face
;
as
if
from
the
remembrance
of
her
own
youth
,
she
had
flown
to
the
remembrance
of
her
child
's
.
<EOS>
Then
,
suddenly
,
she
laid
her
face
down
on
the
bed
,
and
shut
her
head
up
in
her
hands
and
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
were
as
like
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
without
looking
up
,
"
as
you
could
see
two
brothers
,
so
near
an
age
---
there
was
n't
much
more
than
a
year
between
them
,
as
I
recollect
---
and
if
you
could
have
seen
my
gal
,
as
I
have
seen
her
once
,
side
by
side
with
the
other
's
daughter
,
you
'd
have
seen
,
for
all
the
difference
of
dress
and
life
,
that
they
were
like
each
other
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
is
the
likeness
gone
,
and
is
it
my
gal
---
only
my
gal
---
<EOS>
that
's
to
change
so
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
all
change
,
mother
,
in
our
turn
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Turn
!
"
cried
the
old
woman
,
"
but
why
not
hers
as
soon
as
my
gal
's
!
<EOS>
The
mother
must
have
changed
---
she
looked
as
old
as
me
,
and
full
as
wrinkled
through
her
paint
---
but
she
was
handsome
.
<EOS>
What
have
I
done
,
I
,
what
have
I
done
worse
than
her
,
that
only
my
gal
is
to
lie
there
fading
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
another
of
those
wild
cries
,
she
went
running
out
into
the
room
from
which
she
had
come
;
but
immediately
,
in
her
uncertain
mood
,
returned
,
and
creeping
up
to
Harriet
,
said
:
  
"
That
's
what
Alice
bade
<EOS>
me
tell
you
,
deary
.
<EOS>
That
's
all
.
<EOS>
I
found
it
out
when
I
began
to
ask
who
she
was
,
and
all
about
her
,
away
in
Warwickshire
there
,
one
summer
-
time
.
<EOS>
Such
relations
was
no
good
to
me
,
then
.
<EOS>
They
would
n't
have
owned
me
,
and
had
nothing
to
give
me
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
asked
'em
,
maybe
,
for
a
little
money
,
afterwards
,
if
it
had
n't
been
for
my
Alice
;
she
'd
a'most
have
killed
me
,
if
I
had
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
She
was
as
proud
as
t'other
<EOS>
in
her
way
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
touching
the
face
of
her
daughter
fearfully
,
and
withdrawing
her
hand
,
"
for
all
she
's
so
quiet
now
;
but
she
'll
shame
'em
with
her
good
looks
yet
.
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
she
'll
shame
'em
,
<EOS>
will
my
handsome
daughter
!
"
  
<EOS>
Her
laugh
,
as
she
retreated
,
was
worse
than
her
cry
;
worse
than
the
burst
of
imbecile
lamentation
in
which
it
ended
;
worse
than
the
doting
air
with
which
she
sat
down
in
her
old
seat
,
and
stared
out
at
the
darkness
.
  
<EOS>
The
eyes
of
Alice
had
all
this
time
been
fixed
on
Harriet
,
whose
hand
she
had
never
released
.
<EOS>
She
said
now
:
  
"
I
have
felt
,
lying
here
,
that
I
should
like
you
to
know
this
.
<EOS>
It
might
explain
,
I
have
thought
,
something
that
used
to
help
to
harden
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
heard
so
much
,
in
my
wrongdoing
,
of
my
neglected
duty
,
that
I
took
up
with
the
belief
that
duty
had
not
been
done
to
me
,
and
that
as
the
seed
was
sown
,
the
harvest
grew
.
<EOS>
I
somehow
made
it
out
that
when
ladies
had
bad
homes
and
mothers
,
they
went
wrong
in
their
way
,
too
;
but
that
their
way
was
not
so
foul
a
one
as
mine
,
and
they
had
need
to
bless
God
for
it
.
<EOS>
That
is
all
past
.
<EOS>
It
is
like
a
dream
,
now
,
which
I
can
not
quite
remember
or
understand
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
more
and
more
like
a
dream
,
every
day
,
since
you
began
to
sit
here
,
and
to
read
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
only
tell
it
you
,
as
I
can
recollect
it
.
<EOS>
Will
you
read
to
me
a
little
more
?
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
was
withdrawing
her
hand
to
open
the
book
,
when
Alice
detained
it
for
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
forget
my
mother
?
<EOS>
I
forgive
her
,
if
I
have
any
cause
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
she
forgives
me
,
and
is
sorry
in
her
heart
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
forget
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
,
Alice
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
moment
yet
.
<EOS>
Lay
my
head
so
,
dear
,
that
as
you
read
I
may
see
the
words
in
your
kind
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
complied
and
read
---
read
the
eternal
book
for
all
the
weary
and
the
heavy
-
laden
;
for
all
the
wretched
,
fallen
,
and
neglected
of
this
earth
---
read
the
blessed
history
,
in
which
the
blind
lame
palsied
beggar
,
the
criminal
,
<EOS>
the
woman
stained
with
shame
,
the
shunned
of
all
our
dainty
clay
,
has
each
a
portion
,
that
no
human
pride
,
indifference
,
or
sophistry
,
through
all
the
ages
that
this
world
shall
last
,
can
take
away
,
or
by
the
thousandth
atom
of
a
grain
reduce
---
read
the
ministry
of
Him
who
,
through
the
round
of
human
life
,
and
all
its
hopes
and
griefs
,
from
birth
to
death
,
from
infancy
to
age
,
had
sweet
compassion
for
,
and
interest
in
,
its
every
scene
and
stage
,
its
every
suffering
and
sorrow

<EOS>
"
I
shall
come
,
"
said
Harriet
,
when
she
shut
the
book
,
"
very
early
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
lustrous
eyes
,
yet
fixed
upon
her
face
,
closed
for
a
moment
,
then
opened
;
and
Alice
kissed
and
blest
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
same
eyes
followed
her
to
the
door
;
and
in
their
light
,
and
on
the
tranquil
face
,
there
was
a
smile
when
it
was
closed
.
  
<EOS>
They
never
turned
away
.
<EOS>
She
laid
her
hand
upon
her
breast
,
murmuring
the
sacred
name
that
had
been
read
to
her
;
and
life
passed
from
her
face
,
like
light
removed
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
lay
there
,
any
longer
,
but
the
ruin
of
the
mortal
house
on
which
the
rain
had
beaten
,
and
the
black
hair
that
had
fluttered
in
the
wintry
wind

Retribution
 
CHANGES
have
come
again
upon
the
great
house
in
the
long
dull
street
,
once
the
scene
of
Florence
's
childhood
and
loneliness
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
house
still
,
proof
against
wind
and
weather
,
without
breaches
in
the
roof
,
or
shattered
windows
,
or
dilapidated
walls
;
but
it
is
a
ruin
none
the
less
,
and
the
rats
fly
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
and
company
are
,
at
first
,
incredulous
in
respect
of
the
shapeless
rumours
that
they
hear
.
<EOS>
Cook
says
our
people
's
credit
ai
n't
so
easy
shook
as
that
comes
to
,
thank
God
;
and
Mr
Towlinson
expects
to
hear
it
reported
that
the
Bank
of
England
's
a
-
going
to
break
,
or
the
jewels
in
the
Tower
to
be
sold
up
.
<EOS>
But
,
next
come
the
Gazette
,
and
Mr
Perch
:
<EOS>
and
Mr
Perch
brings
Mrs
Perch
to
talk
it
over
in
the
kitchen
,
and
to
spend
a
pleasant
evening
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
,
Mr
Towlinson
's
main
anxiety
is
that
the
failure
should
be
a
good
round
one
---
not
less
than
a
hundred
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
Mr
Perch
do
n't
think
himself
that
a
hundred
thousand
pound
will
nearly
cover
it
.
<EOS>
The
women
,
led
by
Mrs
Perch
and
Cook
,
often
repeat
"
a
hun
-
dred
thous
-
sand
pound
!
"
<EOS>
with
awful
satisfaction
---
as
if
handling
the
word
were
like
handling
the
money
;
and
the
housemaid
,
who
has
her
eye
on
Mr
Towlinson
,
wishes
she
had
only
a
hundredth
part
of
the
sum
to
bestow
on
the
man
of
her
choice
.
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
,
still
mindful
of
his
old
wrong
,
opines
that
a
foreigner
would
hardly
know
what
to
do
with
so
much
money
,
unless
he
spent
it
on
his
whiskers
;
which
bitter
sarcasm
causes
the
housemaid
to
withdraw
in
tears
.
  
<EOS>
But
not
to
remain
long
absent
;
for
Cook
,
who
has
the
reputation
of
being
extremely
good
-
hearted
,
says
,
whatever
they
do
,
let
'em
stand
by
one
another
now
,
Towlinson
,
for
there
's
no
telling
how
soon
they
may
be
divided
.
<EOS>
They
have
been
in
that
house
(
says
Cook
)
through
a
funeral
,
a
wedding
,
and
a
running
-
away
;
and
let
it
not
be
said
that
they
could
n't
agree
among
themselves
at
such
a
time
as
the
present
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Perch
is
immensely
affected
by
this
moving
address
,
and
openly
remarks
that
Cook
is
an
angel
.
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
replies
to
Cook
,
far
be
it
from
him
to
stand
in
the
way
of
that
good
feeling
which
he
could
wish
to
see
;
and
adjourning
in
quest
of
the
housemaid
,
and
presently
returning
with
that
young
lady
on
his
arm
,
informs
the
kitchen
that
foreigners
is
only
his
fun
,
and
that
him
and
Anne
have
now
resolved
to
take
one

and
to
settle
in
Oxford
Market
in
the
general
greengrocery
and
herb
and
leech
line
,
where
your
kind
favours
is
particular
requested
.
<EOS>
This
announcement
is
received
with
acclamation
;
and
Mrs
Perch
,
projecting
her
soul
into
futurity
,
says
,
"
girls
,
"
in
Cook
's
ear
,
in
a
solemn
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
Misfortune
in
the
family
without
feasting
,
in
these
lower
regions
,
Could
n't
be
.
<EOS>
Therefore
Cook
tosses
up
a
hot
dish
or
two
for
supper
,
and
Mr
Towlinson
compounds
a
lobster
salad
to
be
devoted
to
the
same
hospitable
purpose
.
<EOS>
Even
Mrs
Pipchin
,
agitated
by
the
occasion
,
rings
her
bell
,
and
sends
down
word
that
she
requests
to
have
that
little
bit
of
sweet
-
bread
that
was
left
,
warmed
up
for
her
supper
,
and
sent
to
her
on
a
tray
with
about
a
quarter
of
a
tumbler
-
full
of
mulled
sherry
;
for
she
feels
poorly
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
little
talk
about
Mr
Dombey
,
but
very
little
.
<EOS>
It
is
chiefly
speculation
as
to
how
long
he
has
known
that
this
was
going
to
happen
.
<EOS>
Cook
says
shrewdly
,
"
Oh
a
long
time
,
bless
you
!
<EOS>
Take
your
oath
of
that
.
"
<EOS>
And
reference
being
made
to
Mr
Perch
,
he
confirms
her
view
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
Somebody
wonders
what
he
'll
do
,
and
whether
he
'll
go
out
in
any
situation
.
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
thinks
not
,
and
hints
at
a
refuge
in
one
of
them
<EOS>
gen
-
teel
almshouses
of
the
better
kind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
where
he
'll
have
his
little
garden
,
you
know
,
"
says
Cook
plaintively
,
"
and
bring
up
sweet
peas
in
the
spring
.
"
<EOS>
"
Exactly
so
,
"
says
Mr
Towlinson
,
"
and
be
one
of
the
Brethren
of
something
or
another
.
"
<EOS>
"
We
are
all
brethren
,
says
Mrs
Perch
,
in
a
pause
of
her
drink
.
<EOS>
"
Except
the
sisters
,
"
says
Mr
Perch
.
<EOS>
"
How
are
the
mighty
fallen
!
"
<EOS>
remarks
Cook
.
<EOS>
"
Pride
shall
have
a
fall
,
and
it
always
was
and
will
be
so
!
"
observes
the
housemaid
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
wonderful
how
good
they
feel
,
in
making
these
reflections
;
and
what
a
Christian
unanimity
they
are
sensible
of
,
in
bearing
the
common
shock
with
resignation
.
<EOS>
There
is
only
one
interruption
to
this
excellent
state
of
mind
,
which
is
occasioned
by
a
young
kitchen
-
maid
of
inferior
rank
---
in
black
stockings
---
who
,
having
sat
with
her
mouth
open
for
a
long
time
,
unexpectedly
discharges
from
it
words
to
this
effect
,
"
Suppose
the
wages
should
n't
be
paid
!
"
<EOS>
The
company
sit
for
a
moment
speechless
;
but
Cook
recovering
first
,
turns
upon
the
young
woman
,
and
requests
to
know
how
she
dares
insult
the
family
,
whose
bread
she
eats
,
by
such
a
dishonest
supposition
,
and
whether
she
thinks
that
anybody
,
with
a
scrap
of
honour
left
,
could
deprive
poor
servants
of
their
pittance
?
"
<EOS>
Because
if
that
is
your
religious
feelings
,
Mary
Daws
,
"
says
Cook
warmly
,
"
I
do
n't
know
where
you
mean
to
go
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
do
n't
know
either
;
nor
anybody
;
and
the
young
kitchen
-
maid
,
appearing
not
to
know
exactly
,
herself
,
and
scouted
by
the
general
voice
,
is
covered
with
confusion
,
as
with
a
garment
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
few
days
,
strange
people
begin
to
call
at
the
house
,
and
to
make
appointments
with
one
another
in
the
dining
-
room
,
as
if
they
lived
there
.
<EOS>
Especially
,
there
is
a
gentleman
,
of
a
Mosaic
Abrabian
cast
of
countenance
,
with
a
very
massive
watch
-
guard
,
who
whistles
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
,
while
he
is
waiting
for
the
other
gentleman
,
who
always
has
pen
and
ink
in
his
pocket
,
asks
Mr
Towlinson
(
by
the
easy
name
of
"
Old
Cock
,
"
)
if
he
happens
to
know
what
the
figure
of
them
<EOS>
crimson
and
gold
hangings
might
have
been
,
when
new
bought
.
<EOS>
The
callers
and
appointments
in
the
dining
-
room
become
more
numerous
every
day
,
and
every
gentlemen
seems
to
have
pen
and
ink
in
his
pocket
,
and
to
have
some
occasion
to
use
it
.
<EOS>
At
last
it
is
said
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
Sale
;
and
then
more
people
arrive
,
with
pen
and
ink
in
their
pockets
,
commanding
a
detachment
of
men
with
carpet
caps
,
who
immediately
begin
to
pull
up
the
carpets
,
and
knock
the
furniture
about
,
and
to
print
off
thousands
of
impressions
of
their
shoes
upon
the
hall
and
staircase
.
  
<EOS>
The
council
down
stairs
are
in
full
conclave
all
this
time
,
and
,
having
nothing
to
do
,
perform
perfect
feats
of
eating
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
they
are
one
day
summoned
in
a
body
to
Mrs
Pipchin
's
room
,
and
thus
addressed
by
the
fair
Peruvian
:
  
"
Your
master
's
in
difficulties
,
"
says
Mrs
Pipchin
,
tartly
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
,
I
suppose
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
,
as
spokesman
,
admits
a
general
knowledge
of
the
fact
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
're
all
on
the
look
-
out
for
yourselves
,
I
warrant
you
,
"
says
Mrs
Pipchin
,
shaking
her
head
at
them
.
  
<EOS>
A
shrill
voice
from
the
rear
exclaims
,
"
No
more
than
yourself
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
your
opinion
,
Mrs
Impudence
,
is
it
?
"
says
the
ireful
Pipchin
,
looking
with
a
fiery
eye
over
the
intermediate
heads
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mrs
Pipchin
,
it
is
,
"
replies
Cook
,
advancing
.
<EOS>
"
And
what
then
,
pray
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
you
may
go
as
soon
as
you
like
,
"
says
Mrs
Pipchin
,
"
The
sooner
the
better
;
and
I
hope
I
shall
never
see
your
face
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
the
doughty
Pipchin
produces
a
canvas
bag
;
and
tells
her
wages
out
to
that
day
,
and
a
month
beyond
it
:
and
clutches
the
money
tight
until
a
receipt
for
the
same
is
duly
signed
,
to
the
last
up
-
stroke
;
when
she
grudgingly
lets
it
go
.
<EOS>
This
form
of
proceeding
Mrs
Pipchin
repeats
with
every
member
of
the
household
,
until
are
paid
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
those
that
choose
can
go
about
their
business
,
"
says
Mrs
Pipchin
,
"
and
those
that
choose
can
stay
here
on
board
wages
for
a
week
or
so
,
and
make
themselves
useful
.
<EOS>
Except
,
"
says
the
inflammable
Pipchin
,
"
that
slut
of
a
cook
,
who
'll
go
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
,
"
says
Cook
,
"
she
certainly
will
!
<EOS>
I
wish
you
good
day
,
Mrs
Pipchin
,
and
sincerely
wish
I
could
compliment
you
on
the
sweetness
of
your
appearance
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Get
along
with
you
,
"
says
Mrs
Pipchin
,
stamping
her
foot
.
  
<EOS>
Cook
sails
off
with
an
air
of
beneficent
dignity
,
highly
exasperating
to
Mrs
Pipchin
,
and
is
shortly
joined
below
stairs
by
the
rest
of
the
confederation
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
then
says
that
,
in
the
first
place
,
he
would
beg
to
propose
a
little
snack
of
something
to
eat
;
and
over
that
snack
would
desire
to
offer
a
suggestion
which
he
thinks
will
meet
the
position
in
which
they
find
themselves
.
<EOS>
The
refreshment
being
produced
,
and
very
heartily
partaken
of
,
Mr
Towlinson
's
suggestion
is
,
in
effect
,
that
Cook
is
going
,
and
that
if
we
are
not
true
to
ourselves
,
nobody
will
be
true
to
us
.
<EOS>
That
they
have
lived
in
that
house
a
long
time
,
and
exerted
themselves
very
much
to
be
sociable
together
.
<EOS>
(
At
this
,
Cook
says
,
with
emotion
,
"
Hear
,
hear
!
"
<EOS>
and
Mrs
Perch
,
who
is
there
again
,
and
full
to
the
throat
,
sheds
tears
)
.
<EOS>
And
that
he
thinks
,
at
the
present
time
,
the
feeling
ought
to
be
"
Go
one
,
go
all
!
"
<EOS>
The
housemaid
is
much
affected
by
this
generous
sentiment
,
and
warmly
seconds
it
.
<EOS>
Cook
says
she
feels
it
's
right
,
and
only
hopes
it
's
not
done
as
a
compliment
to
her
,
but
from
a
sense
of
duty
.
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
replies
,
from
a
sense
of
duty
;
and
that
now
he
is
driven
to
express
his
opinions
,
he
will
openly
say
,
that
he
does
not
think
it
over
-
respectable
to
remain
in
a
house
where
Sales
and
such
-
like
are
carrying
forwards
.
<EOS>
The
housemaid
is
sure
of
it
;
and
relates
,
in
confirmation
,
that
a
strange
man
,
in
a
carpet
cap
,
offered
this
very
morning
to
kiss
her
on
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
Hereupon
,
Mr
Towlinson
is
starting
from
his
chair
,
to
seek
and
"
smash
"
the
offender
;
when
he
is
laid
hold
on
by
the
ladies
,
who
beseech
him
to
calm
himself
,
and
to
reflect
that
it
is
easier
and
wiser
to
leave
the
scene
of
such
indecencies
at
once
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Perch
,
presenting
the
case
in
a
new
light
,
even
shows
that
delicacy
towards
Mr
Dombey
,
shut
up
in
his
own
rooms
,
imperatively
demands
precipitate
retreat
.
<EOS>
"
For
what
,
"
says
the
good
woman
,
"
must
his
feelings
be
,
if
he
was
to
come
upon
any
of
the
poor
servants
that
he
once
deceived
into
thinking
him
immensely
rich
!
"
<EOS>
Cook
is
so
struck
by
this
moral
consideration
that
Mrs
Perch
improves
it
with
several
pious
axioms
,
original
and
selected
.
<EOS>
It
becomes
a
clear
case
that
they
must
all
go
.
<EOS>
Boxes
are
packed
,
cabs
fetched
,
and
at
dusk
that
evening
there
is
not
one
member
of
the
party
left
.
  
<EOS>
The
house
stands
,
large
and
weather
-
proof
,
in
the
long
dull
street
;
but
it
is
a
ruin
,
and
the
rats
fly
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
men
in
the
carpet
caps
go
on
tumbling
the
furniture
about
;
and
the
gentlemen
with
the
pens
and
ink
make
out
inventories
of
it
,
and
sit
upon
pieces
of
furniture
never
made
to
be
sat
upon
,
and
eat
bread
and
cheese
from
the
public
-
house
on
other
pieces
of
furniture
never
made
to
be
eaten
on
,
and
seem
to
have
a
delight
in
appropriating
precious
articles
to
strange
uses
.
<EOS>
Chaotic
combinations
of
furniture
also
take
place
.
<EOS>
Mattresses
and
bedding
appear
in
the
dining
-
room
;
the
glass
and
china
get
into
the
conservatory
;
the
great
dinner
service
is
set
out
in
heaps
on
the
long
divan
in
the
large
drawing
-
room
;
and
the
stair
-
wires
,
made
into
fasces
,
decorate
the
marble
chimneypieces
.
<EOS>
Finally
,
a
rug
,
with
a
printed
bill
upon
it
,
is
hung
out
from
the
balcony
;
and
a
similar
appendage
graces
either
side
of
the
hall
door
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
all
day
long
,
there
is
a
retinue
of
mouldy
gigs
and
chaise
-
carts
in
the
street
;
and
herds
of
shabby
vampires
,
Jew
and
Christian
,
over
-
run
the
house
,
sounding
the
plate
-
glass
mirrors
with
their
knuckles
,
striking
discordant
octaves
on
the
Grand
Piano
,
drawing
wet
forefingers
over
the
pictures
,
breathing
on
the
blades
of
the
best
dinner
-
knives
,
punching
the
squabs
of
chairs
and
sofas
with
their
dirty
fists
,
touzling
the
feather
beds
,
opening
and
shutting
all
the
drawers
,
balancing
the
silver
spoons
and
forks
,
looking
into
the
very
threads
of
the
drapery
and
linen
,
and
disparaging
everything
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
secret
place
in
the
whole
house
.
<EOS>
Fluffy
and
snuffy
strangers
stare
into
the
kitchen
-
range
as
curiously
as
into
the
attic
clothes
-
press
.
<EOS>
Stout
men
with
napless
hats
on
,
look
out
of
the
bedroom
windows
,
and
cut
jokes
with
friends
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
Quiet
,
calculating
spirits
withdraw
into
the
dressing
-
rooms
with
catalogues
,
and
make
marginal
notes
thereon
,
with
stumps
of
pencils
.
<EOS>
Two
brokers
invade
the
very
fire
-
escape
,
and
take
a
panoramic
survey
of
the
neighbourhood
from
the
top
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
swarm
and
buzz
,
and
going
up
and
down
,
endure
for
days
.
<EOS>
The
Capital
Modern
Household
Furniture
,
&
c.
,
is
on
view
.
  
<EOS>
Then
there
is
a
palisade
of
tables
made
in
the
best
drawing

room
;
and
on
the
capital
,
french

polished
,
extending
,
telescopic
range
of
Spanish

dining

tables
with
turned

,
the

is
erected
;
and
the
herds
of
shabby

,
Jew

Christian
,
the
strangers
fluffy
and
snuffy
,
and
the
stout
men
with
the
napless

,
congregate
about
it
and
sit
upon
everything
within
reach
,
mantel
-
pieces
included
,
and
begin
to
bid

<EOS>
Hot
,
humming
,
and
dusty
are
the
rooms
all
day
;
and
---
high
above
the
heat
,
hum
,
and
dust
---
the
head
and
shoulders
,
voice
and
hammer
,
of
the

are
ever
at
work

<EOS>
The
men
in
the
carpet
caps
get
flustered
and
vicious
with
tumbling
the
Lots
about
,
and
still
the
Lots
are
going
,
going

gone
;
still
coming
on

<EOS>
Sometimes
there
is
joking
and
a
general

This
lasts
all
day
and
three
days
following
.
<EOS>
The
Capital

<EOS>
Then
the
mouldy

reappear
;
and
with
them
come
spring

waggons
,
and
an
army

<EOS>
All
day
long

the

For
nearly
a
whole
week
,
the
Capital
Modern
Household
Furniture
,
&
c.
,
is
in
course
of
removal
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
it
is
all
gone
.
<EOS>
Nothing
is
left
about
the
house
but
scattered
leaves
of
catalogues
,
littered
scraps
of
straw
and
hay
,
and
a
battery
of
pewter
pots
behind
the
hall
-
door
.
<EOS>
The
men
with
the
carpet
caps
gather
up
their
screw
-
drivers
and
bed
-
winches
into
bags
,
shoulder
them
,
and
walk
off
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
pen
-
and
-
ink
gentlemen
goes
over
the
house
as
a
last
attention
;
sticking
up
bills
in
the
windows
respecting
the
lease
of
this
desirable
family
mansion
,
and
shutting
the
shutters
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
follows
the
men
with
the
carpet
caps
.
<EOS>
None
of
the
invaders
remain
.
<EOS>
The
house
is
a
ruin
,
and
the
rats
fly
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
's
apartments
,
together
with
those
locked
rooms
on
the
ground
-
floor
where
the
window
-
blinds
are
drawn
down
close
,
have
been
spared
the
general
devastation
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
has
remained
austere
and
stony
during
the
proceedings
in
her
own
room
;
or
has
occasionally
looked
in
at
the
sale
to
see
what
the
goods
are
fetching
,
and
to
bid
for
one
particular
easy
chair
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
has
been
the
highest
bidder
for
the
easy
chair
,
and
sits
upon
her
property
when
Mrs
Chick
comes
to
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
my
brother
,
Mrs
Pipchin
?
"
says
Mrs
Chick
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
any
more
than
the
deuce
,
"
says
Mrs
Pipchin
.
<EOS>
"
He
never
does
me
the
honour
to
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
has
his
meat
and
drink
put
in
the
next
room
to
his
own
;
and
what
he
takes
,
he
comes
out
and
takes
when
there
's
nobody
there
.
<EOS>
It
's
no
use
asking
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
more
about
him
than
the
man
in
the
south
who
burnt
his
mouth
by
eating
cold
plum
porridge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
the
acrimonious
Pipchin
says
with
a
flounce
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
good
gracious
me
!
"
cries
Mrs
Chick
blandly
.
<EOS>
"
How
long
is
this
to
last
!
<EOS>
If
my
brother
will
not
make
an
effort
,
Mrs
Pipchin
,
what
is
to
become
of
him
?
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
should
have
thought
he
had
seen
enough
of
the
consequences
of
not
making
an
effort
,
by
this
time
,
to
be
warned
against
that
fatal
error
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hoity
toity
!
<EOS>
"
says
Mrs
Pipchin
,
rubbing
her
nose
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
great
fuss
,
I
think
,
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
an't
so
wonderful
a
case
.
<EOS>
People
have
had
misfortunes
before
now
,
and
been
obliged
to
part
with
their
furniture
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
have
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
brother
,
"
pursues
Mrs
Chick
profoundly
,
"
is
so
peculiar
---
so
strange
a
man
.
<EOS>
He
is
the
most
peculiar
man
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
Would
any
one
believe
that
when
he
received
news
of
the
marriage
and
emigration
of
that
unnatural
child
---
it
's
a
comfort
to
me
,
now
,
to
remember
that
I
always
said
there
was
something
extraordinary
about
that
child
:
but
nobody
minds
me
---
<EOS>
would
anybody
believe
,
I
say
,
that
he
should
then
turn
round
upon
me
and
say
he
had
supposed
,
from
my
manner
,
that
she
had
come
to
my
house
?
<EOS>
Why
,
my
gracious
!
<EOS>
And
would
anybody
believe
that
when
I
merely
say
to
him
,
"
Paul
,
I
may
be
very
foolish
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
I
am
,
but
I
can
not
understand
how
your
affairs
can
have
got
into
this
state
,
"
he
should
actually
fly
at
me
,
and
request
that
I
will
come
to
see
him
no
more
until
he
asks
me
!
<EOS>
Why
,
my
goodness
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
says
Mrs
Pipchin
,
"
It
's
a
pity
he
had
n't
a
little
more
to
do
with
mines
.
<EOS>
They
'd
have
tried
his
temper
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
,
"
resumes
Mrs
Chick
,
quite
regardless
of
Mrs
Pipchin
's
observations
,
"
is
it
to
end
in
?
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
want
to
know
.
<EOS>
What
does
my
brother
mean
to
do
?
<EOS>
He
must
do
something
.
<EOS>
It
's
of
no
use
remaining
shut
up
in
his
own
rooms
.
<EOS>
Business
wo
n't
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
He
must
go
to
it
.
<EOS>
Then
why
do
n't
he
go
!
<EOS>
He
knows
where
to
go
,
I
suppose
,
having
been
a
man
of
business
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
Very
good
.
<EOS>
Then
why
not
go
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
,
after
forging
this
powerful
chain
of
reasoning
,
remains
silent
for
a
minute
to
admire
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
"
says
the
discreet
lady
,
with
an
argumentative
air
,
"
who
ever
heard
of
such
obstinacy
as
his
staying
shut
up
here
through
all
these
dreadful
disagreeables
?
<EOS>
It
's
not
as
if
there
was
no
place
for
him
to
go
to
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
could
have
come
to
our
house
.
<EOS>
He
knows
he
is
at
home
there
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
Mr
Chick
has
perfectly
bored
about
it
,
and
I
said
with
my
own
lips
,
"
Why
surely
,
Paul
,
you
do
n't
imagine
that
because
your
affairs
have
got
into
this
state
,
you
are
the
less
at
home
to
such
near
relatives
as
ourselves
?
<EOS>
You
do
n't
imagine
that
we
are
like
the
rest
of
the
world
?
"
<EOS>
But
no
<EOS>
;
here
he
stays
all
through
,
and
here
he
is
.
<EOS>
Why
,
good
gracious
me
,
suppose
the
house
was
to
be
let
!
<EOS>
What
would
he
do
then
?
<EOS>
He
could
n't
remain
here
then
.
<EOS>
If
he
attempted
to
do
so
,
there
would
be
an
ejectment
,
an
action
for
Doe
,
and
all
sorts
of
things
;
and
then
he
must
go
.
<EOS>
Then
why
not
go
at
first
instead
of
at
last
?
<EOS>
And
that
brings
me
back
to
what
I
said
just
now
,
and
I
naturally
ask
what
is
to
be
the
end
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
's
to
be
the
end
of
it
,
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
"
replies
Mrs
Pipchin
,
"
and
that
's
enough
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
'm
going
to
take
myself
off
in
a
jiffy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
a
which
,
Mrs
Pipchin
,
"
says
Mrs
Chick
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
a
jiffy
,
"
retorts
Mrs
Pipchin
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
well
!
<EOS>
really
I
ca
n't
blame
you
,
Mrs
Pipchin
,
"
says
Mrs
Chick
,
with
frankness
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
pretty
much
the
same
to
me
,
if
you
could
,
"
replies
the
sardonic
Pipchin
.
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
I
'm
going
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
stop
here
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
dead
in
a
week
.
<EOS>
I
had
to
cook
my
own
pork
chop
yesterday
,
and
I
'm
not
used
to
it
.
<EOS>
My
constitution
will
be
giving
way
next
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
had
a
very
fair
connexion
at
Brighton
when
I
came
here
---
little
Pankey
's
folks
alone
were
worth
a
good
eighty
pounds
a
-
year
to
me
---
and
I
ca
n't
afford
to
throw
it
away
.
<EOS>
I
've
written
to
my
niece
,
and
she
expects
me
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
spoken
to
my
brother
?
"
inquires
Mrs
Chick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
it
's
very
easy
to
say
speak
to
him
,
"
retorts
Mrs
Pipchin
.
<EOS>
"
How
is
it
done
?
<EOS>
I
called
out
to
him
yesterday
,
that
I
was
no
use
here
,
and
that
he
had
better
let
me
send
for
Mrs
Richards
.
<EOS>
He
grunted
something
or
other
that
meant
yes
,
and
I
sent
!
<EOS>
Grunt
indeed
!
<EOS>
If
he
had
been
Mr
Pipchin
,
he
'd
have
had
some
reason
to
grunt
.
<EOS>
Yah
!
<EOS>
I
've
no
patience
with
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Here
this
exemplary
female
,
who
has
pumped
up
so
much
fortitude
and
virtue
from
the
depths
of
the
Peruvian
mines
,
rises
from
her
cushioned
property
to
see
Mrs
Chick
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
,
deploring
to
the
last
the
peculiar
character
of
her
brother
,
noiselessly
retires
,
much
occupied
with
her
own
sagacity
and
clearness
of
head
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
dusk
of
the
evening
Mr
Toodle
,
being
off
duty
,
arrives
with
Polly
and
a
box
,
and
leaves
them
,
with
a
sounding
kiss
,
in
the
hall
of
the
empty
house
,
the
retired
character
of
which
affects
Mr
Toodle
's
spirits
strongly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
Polly
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
says
Mr
Toodle
,
"
being
now
an
ingein
-
driver
,
and
well
to
do
in
the
world
,
I
should
n't
allow
of
your
coming
here
,
to
be
made
dull
-
like
,
if
it
warn't
<EOS>
for
favours
past
.
<EOS>
But
favours
past
,
Polly
,
is
never
to
be
forgot
.
<EOS>
To
them
which
is
in
adversity
,
besides
,
your
face
is
a
cord'l
.
<EOS>
So
let
's
have
another
kiss
on
it
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
You
wish
no
better
than
to
do
a
right
act
,
I
know
;
and
my
views
is
,
that
it
's
right
and
dutiful
to
do
this
.
<EOS>
Good
night
,
Polly
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
by
this
time
looms
dark
in
her
black
bombazeen
skirts
,
black
bonnet
,
and
shawl
;
and
has
her
personal
property
packed
up
;
and
has
her
chair
(
late
a
favourite
chair
of
Mr
Dombey
's
and
the
dead
bargain
of
the
sale
)
ready
near
the
street
door
;
and
is
only
waiting
for
a
fly
-
van
,
going
to
-
night
to
Brighton
on
private
service
,
which
is
to
call
for
her
,
by
private
contract
,
and
convey
her
home
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
it
comes
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
's
wardrobe
being
handed
in
and
stowed
away
,
Mrs
Pipchin
's
chair
is
next
handed
in
,
and
placed
in
a
convenient
corner
among
certain
trusses
of
hay
;
it
being
the
intention
of
the
amiable
woman
to
occupy
the
chair
during
her
journey
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
herself
is
next
handed
in
,
and
grimly
takes
her
seat
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
snaky
gleam
in
her
hard
grey
eye
,
as
of
anticipated
rounds
of
buttered
toast
,
relays
of
hot
chops
,
worryings
and
quellings
of
young
children
,
sharp
snappings
at
poor
Berry
,
and
all
the
other
delights
of
her
Ogress
's
castle
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
almost
laughs
as
the
fly
-
van
drives
off
,
and
she
composes
her
black
bombazeen
skirts
,
and
settles
herself
among
the
cushions
of
her
easy
chair
.
  
<EOS>
The
house
is
such
a
ruin
that
the
rats
have
fled
,
and
there
is
not
one
left
.
  
<EOS>
But
Polly
,
though
alone
in
the
deserted
mansion
---
for
there
is
no
companionship
in
the
shut
-
up
rooms
in
which
its
late
master
hides
his
head
---
is
not
alone
long
.
<EOS>
It
is
night
;
and
she
is
sitting
at
work
in
the
housekeeper
's
room
,
trying
to
forget
what
a
lonely
house
it
is
,
and
what
a
history
belongs
to
it
;
when
there
is
a
knock
at
the
hall
door
,
as
loud
sounding
as
any
knock
can
be
,
striking
into
such
an
empty
place
.
<EOS>
Opening
it
,
she
returns
across
the
echoing
hall
,
accompanied
by
a
female
figure
in
a
close
black
bonnet
.
<EOS>
It
is
Miss
Tox
,
and
Miss
Tox
's
eyes
are
red
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Polly
,
"
says
Miss
Tox
,
"
when
I
looked
in
to
have
a
little
lesson
with
the
children
just
now
,
I
got
the
message
that
you
left
for
me
;
and
as
soon
as
I
could
recover
my
spirits
at
all
,
I
came
on
after
you
.
<EOS>
Is
there
no
one
here
<EOS>
but
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
not
a
soul
.
<EOS>
"
says
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
seen
him
?
"
<EOS>
whispers
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
,
"
returns
Polly
,
"
<EOS>
no
;
he
has
not
been
seen
this
many
a
day
.
<EOS>
They
tell
me
he
never
leaves
his
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
said
to
be
ill
?
"
<EOS>
inquires
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
ma'am
,
not
that
I
know
of
,
"
returns
Polly
,
"
except
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
very
bad
there
poor
gentleman
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
's
sympathy
is
such
that
she
can
scarcely
speak
.
<EOS>
She
is
no
chicken
,
but
she
has
not
grown
tough
with
age
and
celibacy
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
is
very
tender
,
her
compassion
very
genuine
,
her
homage
very
real
.
<EOS>
Beneath
the
locket
with
the
fishy
eye
in
it
,
Miss
Tox
bears
better
qualities
than
many
a
less
whimsical
outside
;
such
qualities
as
will
outlive
,
by
many
courses
of
the
sun
,
the
best
outsides
and
brightest
husks
that
fall
in
the
harvest
of
the
great
reaper
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
long
before
Miss
Tox
goes
away
,
and
before
Polly
,
with
a
candle
flaring
on
the
blank
stairs
,
looks
after
her
,
for
company
,
down
the
street
,
and
feels
unwilling
to
go
back
into
the
dreary
house
,
and
jar
its
emptiness
with
the
heavy
fastenings
of
the
door
,
and
glide
away
to
bed
.
<EOS>
But
all
this
Polly
does
;
and
in
the
morning
sets
in
one
of
those
darkened
rooms
such
matters
as
she
has
been
advised
to
prepare
,
and
then
retires
and
enters
them
no
more
until
next
morning
at
the
same
hour
.
<EOS>
There
are
bells
there
,
but
they
never
ring
;
and
though
she
can
sometimes
hear
a
footfall
going
to
and
fro
,
it
never
comes
out
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
returns
early
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
It
then
begins
to
be
Miss
Tox
's
occupation
to
prepare
little
dainties
---
or
what
are
such
to
her
---
to
be
carried
into
these
rooms
next
morning
.
<EOS>
She
derives
so
much
satisfaction
from
the
pursuit
,
that
she
enters
on
it
regularly
from
that
time
;
and
brings
daily
in
her
little
basket
,
various
choice
condiments
selected
from
the
scanty
stores
of
the
deceased
owner
of
the
powered
head
and
pigtail
.
<EOS>
She
likewise
brings
,
in
sheets
of
curl
-
paper
,
morsels
of
cold
meats
,
tongues
of
sheep
,
halves
of
fowls
,
for
her
own
dinner
;
and
sharing
these
collations
with
Polly
,
passes
the
greater
part
of
her
time
in
the
ruined
house
that
the
rats
have
fled
from
:
hiding
,
in
a
fright
at
every
sound
,
stealing
in
and
out
like
a
criminal
;
only
desiring
to
be
true
to
the
fallen
object
of
her
admiration
,
unknown
to
him
,
unknown
to
all
the
world
but
one
poor
simple
woman
.
  
<EOS>
The
Major
knows
it
;
but
no
one
is
the
wiser
for
that
,
though
the
Major
is
much
the
merrier
.
<EOS>
The
Major
,
in
a
fit
of
curiosity
,
has
charged
the
Native
to
watch
the
house
sometimes
,
and
find
out
what
becomes
of
Dombey
.
<EOS>
The
Native
has
reported
Miss
Tox
's
fidelity
,
and
the
Major
has
nearly
choked
himself
dead
with
laughter
.
<EOS>
He
is
permanently
bluer
from
that
hour
,
and
constantly
wheezes
to
himself
,
<EOS>
his
lobster
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
,
"
Damme
,
Sir
,
the
woman
's
a
born
idiot
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
the
ruined
man
.
<EOS>
How
does
he
pass
the
hours
,
alone
?
  
<EOS>
"
Let
him
remember
it
in
that
room
,
years
to
come
!
"
<EOS>
He
did
remember
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
heavy
on
his
mind
now
;
heavier
than
all
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
him
remember
it
in
that
room
,
years
to
come
!
<EOS>
The
rain
that
falls
upon
the
roof
,
the
wind
that
mourns
outside
the
door
,
may
have
foreknowledge
in
their
melancholy
sound
.
<EOS>
Let
him
remember
it
in
that
room
,
years
to
come
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
did
remember
it
.
<EOS>
In
the
miserable
night
he
thought
of
it
;
in
the
dreary
day
,
the
wretched
dawn
,
the
ghostly
,
memory
-
haunted
twilight
.
<EOS>
He
did
remember
it
.
<EOS>
In
agony
,
in
sorrow
,
in
remorse
,
in
despair
!
"
<EOS>
Papa
!
<EOS>
papa
!
<EOS>
Speak
to
me
,
dear
papa
!
"
<EOS>
He
heard
the
words
again
,
and
saw
the
face
.
<EOS>
He
saw
it
fall
upon
the
trembling
hands
,
and
heard
the
one
prolonged
low
cry
go
upward
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
fallen
,
never
to
be
raised
up
any
more
.
<EOS>
For
the
night
of
his
worldly
ruin
there
was
no
to
-
morrow
's
sun
;
for
the
stain
of
his
domestic
shame
there
was
no
purification
;
nothing
,
thank
Heaven
,
could
bring
his
dead
child
back
to
life
.
<EOS>
But
that
which
he
might
have
made
so
different
in
all
the
Past
---
which
might
have
made
the
Past
itself
so
different
,
though
this
he
hardly
thought
of
now
---
that
which
was
his
own
work
,
that
which
he
could
so
easily
have
wrought
into
a
blessing
,
and
had
set
himself
so
steadily
for
years
to
form
into
a
curse
:
that
was
the
sharp
grief
of
his
soul
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
He
did
remember
it
!
<EOS>
The
rain
that
fell
upon
the
roof
,
the
wind
that
mourned
outside
the
door
that
night
,
had
had
foreknowledge
in
their
melancholy
sound
.
<EOS>
He
knew
,
now
,
what
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
He
knew
,
now
,
that
he
had
called
down
that
upon
his
head
,
which
bowed
it
lower
that
the
heaviest
stroke
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
He
knew
,
now
,
what
it
was
to
be
rejected
and
deserted
;
now
,
when
every
loving
blossom
he
had
withered
in
his
innocent
daughter
's
heart
was
snowing
down
in
ashes
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
thought
of
her
,
as
she
had
been
that
night
when
he
and
his
bride
came
home
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
her
as
she
had
been
,
in
all
the
home
-
events
,
of
the
abandoned
House
.
<EOS>
He
thought
,
now
,
that
of
all
around
him
,
she
alone
had
never
changed
.
<EOS>
His
boy
had
faded
into
dust
,
his
proud
wife
had
sunk
into
a
polluted
creature
,
his
flatterer
and
friend
had
been
transformed
into
the
worst
of
villains
,
his
riches
had
melted
away
,
the
very
walls
that
sheltered
him
looked
on
him
as
a
stranger
;
she
alone
had
turned
the
same
mild
gentle
look
upon
him
always
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
to
the
latest
and
the
last
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
changed
to
him
---
nor
had
he
ever
changed
to
her
---
and
she
was
lost
.
  
<EOS>
As
,
one
by
one
,
they
fell
away
before
his
mind
---
<EOS>
his
baby
-
hope
,
his
wife
,
his
friend
,
his
fortune
---
oh
how
the
mist
,
through
which
he
had
seen
her
,
cleared
,
and
showed
him
her
true
self
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
much
better
than
this
that
he
had
loved
her
as
had
hid
boy
,
and
lost
her
as
he
had
his
boy
,
and
laid
them
in
their
early
grave
together
!
  
<EOS>
In
his
pride
---
for
he
was
proud
yet
---
<EOS>
he
let
the
world
go
from
him
freely
.
<EOS>
As
it
fell
away
,
he
shook
it
off
.
<EOS>
Whether
he
imagined
its
face
as
expressing
pity
for
him
,
or
indifference
to
him
,
he
shunned
it
alike
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
same
degree
to
be
avoided
,
in
either
aspect
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
idea
of
any
one
companion
in
his
misery
,
but
the
one
he
had
driven
away
.
<EOS>
What
he
would
have
said
to
her
,
or
what
consolation
submitted
to
receive
from
her
,
he
never
pictured
to
himself
.
<EOS>
But
he
always
knew
she
would
have
been
true
to
him
,
if
he
had
suffered
her
.
<EOS>
He
always
knew
she
would
have
loved
him
better
now
,
than
at
any
other
time
:
he
was
as
certain
that
it
was
in
her
nature
,
as
he
was
that
there
was
a
sky
above
him
;
and
he
sat
thinking
so
,
in
his
loneliness
,
from
hour
to
hour
.
<EOS>
Day
after
day
uttered
this
speech
;
night
after
night
showed
him
this
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
It
began
,
beyond
all
doubt
(
however
slow
it
advanced
for
some
time
)
,
in
the
receipt
of
her
young
husband
's
letter
,
and
the
certainty
that
she
was
gone
.
<EOS>
And
yet
---
so
proud
he
was
in
his
ruin
,
or
so
reminiscent
of
her
,
only
as
something
that
might
have
been
his
,
but
was
lost
beyond
redemption
---
that
if
he
could
have
heard
her
voice
in
an
adjoining
room
,
he
would
not
have
gone
to
her
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
have
seen
her
in
the
street
,
and
she
had
done
no
more
than
look
at
him
as
she
had
been
used
to
look
,
he
would
have
passed
on
with
his
old
cold
unforgiving
face
,
and
not
addressed
her
,
or
relaxed
it
,
though
his
heart
should
have
broken
soon
afterwards
.
<EOS>
However
turbulent
his
thoughts
,
or
harsh
is
anger
had
been
,
at
first
,
concerning
her
marriage
,
or
her
husband
<EOS>
,
that
was
all
past
now
.
<EOS>
He
chiefly
thought
of
what
might
have
been
,
and
what
was
not
.
<EOS>
What
was
,
was
all
summed
up
in
this
:
that
she
was
lost
,
and
he
bowed
down
with
sorrow
and
remorse
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
he
felt
that
he
had
had
two
children
born
to
him
in
that
house
,
and
that
between
him
and
the
bare
wide
empty
walls
there
was
a
tie
,
mournful
,
but
hard
to
rend
asunder
,
connected
with
a
double
childhood
,
and
a
double
loss
.
<EOS>
He
had
thought
to
leave
the
house
---
knowing
he
must
go
,
not
knowing
whither
---
upon
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
this
feeling
first
struck
root
in
his
breast
;
but
he
resolved
to
stay
another
night
,
and
in
the
night
to
ramble
through
the
rooms
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
out
of
his
solitude
when
it
was
the
dead
of
night
,
and
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
went
softly
up
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
Of
all
the
footmarks
there
,
making
them
as
common
as
the
common
street
,
there
was
not
one
,
he
thought
,
but
had
seemed
at
the
time
to
set
itself
upon
his
brain
while
he
had
kept
close
,
listening
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
their
number
,
and
their
hurry
,
and
contention
---
foot
treading
foot
out
,
and
upward
track
and
downward
jostling
one
another
---
and
thought
,
with
absolute
dread
and
wonder
,
how
much
he
must
have
suffered
during
that
trial
,
and
what
a
changed
man
he
had
cause
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
thought
,
besides
,
oh
was
there
,
somewhere
in
the
world
,
a
light
footstep
that
might
have
worn
out
in
a
moment
half
those
marks
!
---
and
bent
his
head
,
and
wept
as
he
went
up
.
  
<EOS>
He
almost
saw
it
,
going
on
before
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
looking
up
towards
the
skylight
;
and
a
figure
,
childish
itself
,
but
carrying
a
child
,
and
singing
as
it
went
,
seemed
to
be
there
again
.
<EOS>
Anon
,
it
was
the
same
figure
,
alone
,
stopping
for
an
instant
,
with
suspended
breath
;
the
bright
hair
clustering
loosely
round
its
tearful
face
;
and
looking
back
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
wandered
through
the
rooms
:
lately
so
luxurious
;
now
so
bare
and
dismal
and
so
changed
,
apparently
,
even
in
their
shape
and
size
.
<EOS>
The
press
of
footsteps
was
as
thick
here
;
and
the
same
consideration
of
the
suffering
he
had
had
,
perplexed
and
terrified
him
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
fear
that
all
this
intricacy
in
his
brain
would
drive
him
mad
;
and
that
his
thoughts
already
lost
coherence
as
the
footprints
did
,
and
were
pieced
on
to
one
another
,
with
the
same
trackless
involutions
,
and
varieties
of
indistinct
shapes
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
so
much
as
know
in
which
of
these
rooms
she
had
lived
,
when
she
was
alone
.
<EOS>
He
was
glad
to
leave
them
,
and
go
wandering
higher
up
.
<EOS>
Abundance
of
associations
were
here
,
connected
with
his
false
wife
,
his
false
friend
and
servant
,
his
false
grounds
of
pride
;
but
he
put
them
all
by
now
,
and
only
recalled
miserably
,
weakly
,
fondly
,
his
two
children
.
  
<EOS>
Everywhere
,
the
footsteps
!
<EOS>
They
had
had
no
respect
for
the
old
room
high
up
,
where
the
little
bed
had
been
;
he
could
hardly
find
a
clear
space
there
,
to
throw
himself
down
,
on
the
floor
,
against
the
wall
,
poor
broken
man
,
and
let
his
tears
flow
as
they
would
.
<EOS>
He
had
shed
so
many
tears
here
,
long
ago
,
that
he
was
less
ashamed
of
his
weakness
in
this
place
than
in
any
other
---
perhaps
,
with
that
consciousness
,
had
made
excuses
to
himself
for
coming
here
.
<EOS>
Here
,
with
stooping
shoulders
,
and
his
chin
dropped
on
his
breast
,
he
had
come
.
<EOS>
Here
,
thrown
upon
the
bare
boards
,
in
the
dead
of
night
,
he
wept
,
alone
---
a
proud
man
,
even
then
;
who
,
if
a
kind
hand
could
have
been
stretched
out
,
or
a
kind
face
could
have
looked
in
would
have
risen
up
,
and
turned
away
,
and
gone
down
to
his
cell
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
day
broke
he
was
shut
up
in
his
rooms
again
.
<EOS>
He
had
meant
to
go
away
to
-
day
,
but
clung
to
this
tie
in
the
house
as
<EOS>
the
last
and
only
thing
left
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
came
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Every
night
,
within
the
knowledge
of
no
human
creature
,
he
came
forth
,
and
wandered
through
the
despoiled
house
like
a
ghost
.
<EOS>
Many
a
morning
when
the
day
broke
,
his
altered
face
,
drooping
behind
the
closed
blind
in
his
window
,
imperfectly
transparent
to
the
light
as
yet
,
pondered
on
the
loss
of
his
two
children
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
child
no
more
.
<EOS>
He
reunited
them
in
his
thoughts
,
and
they
were
never
asunder
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
he
could
have
united
them
in
his
past
love
,
and
in
death
,
and
that
one
had
not
been
so
much
worse
than
dead
!
  
<EOS>
Strong
mental
agitation
and
disturbance
was
no
novelty
to
him
,
even
before
his
late
suffering
.
<EOS>
It
never
is
,
to
obstinate
and
sullen
natures
;
for
they
struggle
hard
to
be
such
.
<EOS>
Ground
,
long
undermined
,
will
often
fall
down
in
a
moment
;
what
was
undermined
here
in
so
many
ways
,
weakened
,
and
crumbled
,
little
by
little
,
more
and
more
,
as
the
hand
moved
on
the
dial
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
he
began
to
think
he
need
not
go
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
might
yet
give
up
what
his
creditors
had
spared
him
(
that
they
had
not
spared
him
more
,
was
his
own
act
)
,
and
only
sever
the
tie
between
him
and
the
ruined
house
,
by
severing
that
other
link
  
<EOS>
It
was
then
that
his
footfall
was
audible
in
the
late
house
-
keeper
's
room
,
as
he
walked
to
and
fro
;
but
not
audible
in
its
true
meaning
,
or
it
would
have
had
an
appalling
sound
.
  
<EOS>
The
world
was
very
busy
and
restless
about
him
.
<EOS>
He
became
aware
of
that
again
.
<EOS>
It
was
whispering
and
babbling
.
<EOS>
It
was
never
quiet
.
<EOS>
This
,
and
the
intricacy
and
complication
of
the
footsteps
,
harassed
him
to
death
.
<EOS>
Objects
began
to
take
a
bleared
and
russet
colour
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
Dombey
and
Son
was
no
more
---
his
children
no
more
.
<EOS>
This
must
be
thought
of
,
well
,
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
He
thought
of
it
to
-
morrow
;
and
sitting
thinking
in
his
chair
,
saw
in
the
glass
,
from
time
to
time
,
this
picture
:
  
A
spectral
,
haggard
,
wasted
likeness
of
himself
,
brooded
and
brooded
over
the
empty
fireplace
.
<EOS>
Now
it
lifted
up
its
head
,
examining
the
lines
and
hollows
in
its
face
;
now
hung
it
down
again
,
and
brooded
afresh
.
<EOS>
Now
it
rose
and
walked
about
;
now
passed
into
the
next
room
,
and
came
back
with
something
from
the
dressing
-
table
in
its
breast
.
<EOS>
Now
,
it
was
looking
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
,
and
thinking
.
   
<EOS>
---
Hush
!
<EOS>
what
?
  
<EOS>
It
was
thinking
that
if
blood
were
to
trickle
that
way
,
and
to
leak
out
into
the
hall
,
it
must
be
a
long
time
going
so
far
.
<EOS>
It
would
move
so
stealthily
and
slowly
,
creeping
on
,
with
her
a
lazy
little
pool
,
and
there
a
start
,
and
then
another
little
pool
,
that
a
desperately
wounded
man
could
only
be
discovered
through
its
means
,
either
dead
or
dying
.
<EOS>
When
it
had
thought
of
this
a
long
while
,
it
got
up
again
,
and
walked
to
and
fro
with
its
hand
in
its
breast
.
<EOS>
He
glanced
at
it
occasionally
,
very
curious
to
watch
its
motions
,
and
he
marked
how
wicked
and
murderous
that
hand
looked
.
  
<EOS>
Now
it
was
thinking
again
!
<EOS>
What
was
it
thinking
?
  
<EOS>
Whether
they
would
tread
in
the
blood
when
it
crept
so
far
,
and
carry
it
about
the
house
among
those
many
prints
of
feet
,
or
even
out
into
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
It
sat
down
,
with
its
eyes
upon
the
empty
fireplace
,
and
as
it
lost
itself
in
thought
there
shone
into
the
room
a
gleam
of
light
;
a
ray
of
sun
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
unmindful
,
and
sat
thinking
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
it
rose
,
with
a
terrible
face
,
and
that
guilty
hand
grasping
what
was
in
its
breast
.
<EOS>
Then
it
was
arrested
by
a
cry
---
a
wild
,
loud
,
piercing
,
loving
rapturous
cry
---
and
he
only
saw
his
own
reflection
in
the
glass
,
and
at
his
knees
,
his
daughter
!
  
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
His
daughter
!
<EOS>
Look
at
her
!
<EOS>
Look
here
!
<EOS>
Down
upon
the
ground
,
clinging
to
him
,
calling
to
him
,
folding
her
hands
,
praying
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
!
<EOS>
Dearest
papa
!
<EOS>
Pardon
me
,
forgive
me
!
<EOS>
I
have
come
back
to
ask
forgiveness
on
my
knees
.
<EOS>
I
never
can
be
happy
more
,
without
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Unchanged
still
.
<EOS>
Of
all
the
world
,
unchanged
.
<EOS>
Raising
the
same
face
to
his
,
as
on
that
miserable
night
.
<EOS>
Asking
his
forgiveness
!
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
papa
,
oh
do
n't
look
strangely
on
me
!
<EOS>
I
never
meant
to
leave
you
.
<EOS>
I
never
thought
of
it
,
before
or
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
was
frightened
when
I
went
away
,
and
could
not
think
.
<EOS>
Papa
,
dear
,
I
am
changed
.
<EOS>
I
am
penitent
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
fault
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
duty
better
now
.
<EOS>
Papa
,
do
n't
cast
me
off
,
or
I
shall
die
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
tottered
to
his
chair
.
<EOS>
He
felt
her
draw
his
arms
about
her
neck
;
he
felt
her
put
her
own
round
his
;
he
felt
her
kisses
on
his
face
;
he
felt
her
wet
cheek
laid
against
his
own
;
he
felt
---
<EOS>
oh
,
how
deeply
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
all
that
he
had
done
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
the
breast
that
he
had
bruised
,
against
the
heart
that
he
had
almost
broken
,
she
laid
his
face
,
now
covered
with
his
hands
,
and
said
,
sobbing
:
  
"
Papa
,
love
,
I
am
a
mother
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
child
who
will
soon
call
Walter
by
the
name
by
which
I
call
you
.
<EOS>
When
it
was
born
,
and
when
I
knew
how
much
I
loved
it
,
I
knew
what
I
had
done
in
leaving
you
.
<EOS>
Forgive
me
,
dear
Papa
!
<EOS>
oh
say
God
bless
me
,
and
my
little
child
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
would
have
said
it
,
if
he
could
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
raised
his
hands
and
besought
her
for
pardon
,
but
she
caught
them
in
her
own
,
and
put
them
down
,
hurriedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
little
child
was
born
at
sea
,
Papa
.
<EOS>
I
prayed
to
God
(
and
so
did
Walter
for
me
)
to
spare
me
,
that
I
might
come
home
.
<EOS>
The
moment
I
could
land
,
I
came
back
to
you
.
<EOS>
Never
let
us
be
parted
any
more
,
Papa
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
head
,
now
grey
,
was
encircled
by
her
arm
;
and
he
groaned
to
think
that
never
,
never
,
had
it
rested
so
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
come
home
with
me
,
Papa
,
and
see
my
baby
.
<EOS>
A
boy
,
Papa
.
<EOS>
His
name
is
Paul
.
<EOS>
I
think
---
<EOS>
I
hope
---
he
's
like

"
  
Her
tears
stopped
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Papa
,
for
the
sake
of
my
child
,
for
the
sake
of
the
name
we
have
given
him
,
for
my
sake
,
pardon
Walter
.
<EOS>
He
is
so
kind
and
tender
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
happy
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
his
fault
that
we
were
married
.
<EOS>
It
was
mine
.
<EOS>
I
loved
him
so
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
clung
closer
to
him
,
more
endearing
and
more
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
the
darling
of
my
heart
,
Papa
.
<EOS>
I
would
die
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
will
love
and
honour
your
as
I
will
.
<EOS>
We
will
teach
our
little
child
to
love
and
honour
you
;
and
we
will
tell
him
,
when
he
can
understand
,
that
you
had
a
son
of
that
name
once
,
and
that
he
died
,
and
you
were
very
sorry
;
but
that
he
is
gone
to
Heaven
,
where
we
all
hope
to
see
him
when
our
time
for
resting
comes
.
<EOS>
Kiss
me
,
Papa
,
as
a
promise
that
you
will
be
reconciled
to
Walter
---
to
my
dearest
husband
---
to
the
father
of
the
little
child
who
taught
me
to
come
back
,
Papa
.
<EOS>
Who
taught
me
to
come
back
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
clung
closer
to
him
,
in
another
burst
of
tears
,
he
kissed
her
on
her
lips
,
and
,
lifting
up
his
eyes
,
said
,
"
Oh
my
God
,
forgive
me
,
for
I
need
it
very
much
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
he
dropped
his
head
again
,
lamenting
over
and
caressing
her
,
and
there
was
not
a
sound
in
all
the
house
for
a
long
,
long
time
;
they
remaining
clasped
in
one
another
's
arms
,
in
the
glorious
sunshine
that
had
crept
in
with
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
He
dressed
himself
for
going
out
,
with
a
docile
submission
to
her
entreaty
;
and
walking
with
a
feeble
gait
,
and
looking
back
,
with
a
tremble
,
at
the
room
in
which
he
had
been
so
long
shut
up
,
and
where
he
had
seen
the
picture
in
the
glass
,
passed
out
with
her
into
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Florence
,
hardly
glancing
round
her
,
lest
she
should
remind
him
freshly
of
their
last
parting
---
for
their
feet
were
on
the
very
stones
where
he
had
struck
her
in
his
madness
---
and
keeping
close
to
him
,
with
her
eyes
upon
his
face
,
and
his
arm
about
her
,
led
him
out
to
a
coach
that
was
waiting
at
the
door
,
and
carried
him
away
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
Miss
Tox
and
Polly
came
out
of
their
concealment
,
and
exulted
tearfully
.
<EOS>
And
then
they
packed
his
clothes
,
and
books
,
and
so
forth
,
with
great
care
;
and
consigned
them
in
due
course
to
certain
persons
sent
by
Florence
in
the
evening
,
to
fetch
them
.
<EOS>
And
then
they
took
a
last
cup
of
tea
in
the
lonely
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
Dombey
and
Son
,
as
I
observed
upon
a
certain
sad
occasion
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
winding
up
a
host
of
recollections
,
"
is
indeed
a
daughter
,
Polly
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
a
good
one
!
"
exclaimed
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
;
"
and
it
's
a
credit
to
you
Polly
,
that
you
were
always
her
friend
when
she
was
a
little
child
.
<EOS>
You
were
her
friend
long
before
I
was
,
Polly
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
;
"
and
you
're
a
good
creature
.
<EOS>
Robin
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
addressed
herself
to
a
bullet
-
headed
young
man
,
who
appeared
to
be
in
but
indifferent
circumstances
,
and
in
depressed
spirits
,
and
who
was
sitting
in
a
remote
corner
.
<EOS>
Rising
,
he
disclosed
to
view
the
form
and
features
of
the
Grinder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Robin
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
"
I
have
just
observed
to
your
mother
,
as
you
may
have
heard
,
that
she
is
a
good
creature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
so
she
is

<EOS>
Miss.
"
quoth
the
Grinder
,
with
some
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
Robin
,
"
said
Miss
Tox
,
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Robin
,
as
I
am
going
to
give
you
a
trial
,
at
your
urgent
request
,
as
my
domestic
,
with
a
view
to
your
restoration
to
respectability
,
I
will
take
this
impressive
occasion
of
remarking
that
I
hope
you
will
never
forget
that
you
have
,
and
have
always
had
,
a
good
mother
,
and
that
your
will
endeavour
so
to
conduct
yourself
as
to
be
a
comfort
to
her

<EOS>
"
Upon
my
soul
I
will

Miss

returned
the
Grinder
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
through

I

yourself

Miss

politely

As

the

Much

remarked
Miss

complacently
;

infinitely
more
expressive

pursued
Rob
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
had

been

Will

Robin

"
  
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
Miss
,
"
returned
the
Grinder
;
who
immediately
began
to
use
his
own
personal
grinders
in
a
most
remarkable
manner
,
as
if
he
had
been
on
very
short
allowance
for
a
considerable
period
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
,
being
,
in
good
time
,
bonneted
and
shawled
,
and
Polly
too
,
Rob
hugged
his
mother
,
and
followed
his
new
mistress
away
;
so
much
to
the
hopeful
admiration
of
Polly
,
that
something
in
her
eyes
made
luminous
rings
round
the
gas
-
lamps
as
she
looked
after
him
.
<EOS>
Polly
then
put
out
her
light
,
locked
the
house
-
door
,
delivered
the
key
at
an
agent
's
hard
by
,
and
went
home
as
fast
as
she
could
go
;
rejoicing
in
the
shrill
delight
that
her
unexpected
arrival
would
occasion
there
.
<EOS>
The
great
house
,
dumb
as
to
all
that
had
been
suffered
in
it
,
and
the
changes
it
had
witnessed
,
stood
frowning
like
a
dark
mute
on
the
street
;
baulking
any
nearer
inquiries
with
the
staring
announcement
that
the
lease
of
this
desirable
Family
Mansion
was
to
be
disposed
of

<EOS>
THE
grand
half
-
yearly
festival
holden
by
Doctor
and
Mrs
Blimber
,
on
which
occasion
<EOS>
they
requested
the
pleasure
of
the
company
of
every
young
gentleman
pursuing
his
studies
in
that
genteel
establishment
,
at
an
early
party
,
when
the
hour
was
half
-
past
seven
o'clock
,
and
when
the
object
was
quadrilles
,
had
duly
taken
place
,
about
this
time
;
and
the
young
gentleman
,
with
no
unbecoming
demonstrations
of
levity
,
had
betaken
themselves
,
in
a
state
of
scholastic
repletion
,
to
their
own
homes
.
<EOS>
Mr
Skettles
had
repaired
abroad
,
permanently
to
grace
the
establishment
of
his
father
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
,
whose
popular
manners
had
obtained
him
a
diplomatic
appointment
,
the
honours
of
which
were
discharged
by
himself
and
Lady
Skettles
,
to
the
satisfaction
even
of
their
own
countrymen
and
countrywomen
:
which
was
considered
almost
miraculous
.
<EOS>
Mr
Tozer
,
now
a
young
man
of
lofty
stature
,
in
Wellington
boots
,
was
so
extremely
full
of
antiquity
as
to
be
nearly
on
a
par
with
a
genuine
ancient
Roman
in
his
knowledge
of
English
:
a
triumph
that
affected
his
good
parents
with
the
tenderest
emotions
,
and
caused
the
father
and
mother
of
Mr
Briggs
(
whose
learning
,
like
ill
-
arranged
luggage
,
was
so
tightly
packed
that
he
could
n't
get
at
anything
he
wanted
)
to
hide

The
fruit
laboriously
gathered
from
the
tree
of
knowledge
by
this
latter
young
gentleman
,
in
fact
,
had
been
subjected
to
so
much
pressure
,
that
it
had
become
a
kind
of
intellectual
Norfolk
Biffin
,
and
had
nothing
of
its
original
form
or
flavour
remaining
.
<EOS>
Master
Bitherstone
now
,
on
whom
the
forcing
system
had
the
happier
and
not
uncommon
effect
of
leaving
no
impression
whatever
,
when
the
forcing
apparatus
ceased
to
work
,
was
in
a
much
more
comfortable
plight
;
and
being
then
on
shipboard
,
bound
for
Bengal
,
found
himself
forgetting
,
with
such
admirable
rapidity
,
that
it
was
doubtful
whether
his
declensions
of
noun
-
substantives
would
hold
out
to
the
end
of
the
voyage
.
  
<EOS>
When
Doctor
Blimber
,
in
pursuance
of
the
usual
course
,
would
have
said
to
the
young
gentleman
,
on
the
morning
of
the
party
,
"
Gentlemen
,
we
will
resume
our
studies
on
the
twenty
-
fifth
of
next
month
,
"
he
departed
from
the
usual
course
,
and
said
,
"
Gentlemen
,
when
our
friend
Cincinnatus
retired
to
his
farm
,
he
did
not
present
to
the
senate
any
Roman
whom
he
sought
to
nominate
as
his
successor
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
a
Roman
here
,
"
said
Doctor
Blimber
,
laying
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
,
"
adolescens
imprimis
gravis
et
doctus
,
gentlemen
,
whom
I
,
a
retiring
Cincinnatus
,
wish
to
present
to
my
little
senate
,
as
their
future
Dictator
.
<EOS>
Gentleman
,
we
will
resume
our
studies
on
the
twenty
-
fifth
of
next
month
,
under
the
auspices
of
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
.
<EOS>
"
At
this
(
which
Doctor
Blimber
had
previously
called
upon
all
the
parents
,
and
urbanely
explained
)
,
the
young
gentlemen
cheered
;
and
Mr
Tozer
,
on
behalf
of
the
rest
,
instantly
presented
the
Doctor
with
a
silver
inkstand
,
in
a
speech
containing
very
little
of
the
mother
-
tongue
,
but
fifteen
quotations
from
the
Latin
,
and
seven
from
the
Greek
,
which
moved
the
younger
of
the
young
gentlemen
to
discontent
and
envy
:
they
remarking
,
"
Oh
,
ah!It
was
all
very
well
for
old
Tozer
,
but
they
did
n't
subscribe
money
for
old
Tozer
to
show
off
with
,
they
supposed
;
did
they
?
<EOS>
What
business
was
it
of
old
Tozer
's
more
than
anybody
else
's
?
<EOS>
It
was
n't
his
inkstand
.
<EOS>
Why
could
n't
he
leave
the
boys
'
property
alone
?
"
and
murmuring
other
expressions
of
their
dissatisfaction
,
which
seemed
to
find
a
greater
relief
in
calling
him
old
Tozer
,
than
in
any
other
available
vent
.
  
<EOS>
Not
a
word
had
been
said
to
the
young
gentlemen
,
nor
a
hint
dropped
,
of
anything
like
a
contemplated
marriage
between
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
,
and
the
fair
Cornelia
Blimber
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Blimber
,
especially
,
seemed
to
take
pains
to
look
as
if
nothing
would
surprise
him
more
;
but
it
was
perfectly
well
known
to
all
the
young
gentlemen
nevertheless
,
and
when
they
departed
for
the
society
of
their
relations
and
friends
,
they
took
leave
of
Mr
Feeder
with
awe
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
's
most
romantic
visions
were
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
The
Doctor
had
determined
to
paint
the
house
outside
,
and
put
it
in
thorough
repair
;
and
to
give
up
the
business
,
and
to
give
up
Cornelia
.
<EOS>
The
painting
and
repairing
began
upon
the
very
day
of
the
young
gentlemen
's
departure
,
and
now
behold
!
<EOS>
the
wedding
morning
was
come
,
and
Cornelia
,
in
a
new
pair
of
spectacles
,
was
waiting
to
be
led
to
the
hymeneal
altar
.
  
<EOS>
The
Doctor
with
his
learned
legs
,
and
Mrs
Blimber
in
a
lilac
bonnet
,
and
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
,
with
his
long
knuckles
and
his
bristly
head
of
hair
,
and
Mr
Feeder
's
brother
,
the
Reverend
Alfred
Feeder
,
MA
,
who
was
to
perform
the
ceremony
,
were
all
assembled
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
Cornelia
with
her
orange
-
flowers
and
bridesmaids
had
just
come
down
,
and
looked
,
as
of
old
,
a
little
squeezed
in
appearance
,
but
very
charming
,
when
the
door
opened
,
and
the
weak
-
eyed
young
man
,
in
a
loud
voice
,
made
the
following
proclamation
:
  
"
MR
AND
MRS
TOOTS
!
"
  
<EOS>
Upon
which
there
entered
Mr
Toots
,
grown
extremely
stout
,
and
on
his
arm
a
lady
very
handsomely
and
becomingly
dressed
,
with
very
bright
black
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Blimber
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
allow
me
to
present
my
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Blimber
was
delighted
to
receive
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Blimber
was
a
little
condescending
,
but
extremely
kind
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
as
you
've
known
me
for
a
long
time
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
let
me
assure
you
that
she
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
women
that
ever
lived
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
!
"
remonstrated
Mrs
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
and
honour
she
is
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
assure
you
,
Mrs
Blimber
,
she
's
a
most
extraordinary
woman
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Toots
laughed
merrily
,
and
Mrs
Blimber
led
her
to
Cornelia
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
having
paid
his
respects
in
that
direction
,
and
having
saluted
his
old
preceptor
,
who
said
,
in
allusion
to
his
conjugal
state
,
"
Well
,
Toots
,
well
,
Toots
!
<EOS>
So
you
are
one
of
us
,
are
you
,
Toots
?
"
---
retired
with
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
,
into
a
window
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
,
being
in
great
spirits
,
made
a
spar
at
Mr
Toots
,
and
tapped
him
skilfully
with
the
back
of
his
hand
on
the
breast
-
bone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
old
Buck
!
"
said
Mr
Feeder
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
Well!Here
we
are
!
<EOS>
Taken
in
and
done
for
.
<EOS>
Eh
?
"
  
"
Feeder
,
"
returned
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
I
give
you
joy
.
<EOS>
If
you
're
as
---
as
---
as
perfectly
blissful
in
a
matrimonial
life
,
as
I
am
myself
,
you
'll
have
nothing
to
desire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
forget
my
old
friends
,
you
see
,
"
said
Mr
Feeder
.
<EOS>
"
I
ask
'em
to
my
wedding
,
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Feeder
,
"
replied
Mr
Toots
gravely
,
"
the
fact
is
,
that
there
were
several
circumstances
which
prevented
me
from
communicating
with
you
until
after
my
marriage
had
been
solemnised
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
I
had
made
a
perfect
Brute
of
myself
to
you
,
on
the
subject
of
Miss
Dombey
;
and
I
felt
that
if
you
were
asked
to
any
wedding
of
mine
,
you
would
naturally
expect
that
it
was
with
Miss
Dombey
,
which
involved
explanations
,
that
upon
my
word
and
honour
,
at
that
crisis
,
would
have
knocked
me
completely
over
.
<EOS>
In
the
second
place
,
our
wedding
was
strictly
private
;
there
being
nobody
present
but
one
friend
of
myself
and
Mrs
Toots
's
,
who
is
a
Captain
in
---
<EOS>
I
do
n't
exactly
know
in
what
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
but
it
's
of
no
consequence
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
Feeder
,
that
in
writing
a
statement
of
what
had
occurred
before
Mrs
Toots
and
myself
went
abroad
upon
our
foreign
tour
,
I
fully
discharged
the
offices
of
friendship
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Toots
,
my
boy
,
"
said
Mr
Feeder
,
shaking
his
hands
,
"
I
was
joking
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
now
,
Feeder
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
I
should
be
glad
to
know
what
you
think
of
my
union
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Capital
!
"
returned
Mr
Feeder
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
it
's
capital
,
do
you
,
Feeder
?
"
said
Mr
Toots
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
how
capital
must
it
be
to
Me
!
<EOS>
For
you
can
never
know
what
an
extraordinary
woman
that
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
was
willing
to
take
it
for
granted
.
<EOS>
But
Mr
Toots
shook
his
head
,
and
would
n't
hear
of
that
being
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
what
I
wanted
in
a
wife
was
---
in
short
,
was
sense
.
<EOS>
Money
,
Feeder
,
I
had
.
<EOS>
Sense
<EOS>
I
---
I
had
not
,
particularly
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
murmured
,
"
Oh
,
yes
,
you
had
,
Toots
!
"
<EOS>
But
Mr
Toots
said
:
  
"
<EOS>
No
,
Feeder
,
I
had
not
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
disguise
it
?
<EOS>
I
had
not
I
knew
that
sense
was
There
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
stretching
out
his
hand
towards
his
wife
,
"
in
perfect
heaps
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
relation
to
object
or
be
offended
,
on
the
score
of
station
;
for
I
had
no
relation
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
had
anybody
belonging
to
me
but
my
guardian
,
and
him
,
Feeder
<EOS>
,
I
have
always
considered
as
a
Pirate
and
a
Corsair
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
you
know
it
was
not
likely
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
that
I
should
take
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr
Feeder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Accordingly
,
"
resumed
Mr
Toots
,
"
I
acted
on
my
own
.
<EOS>
Bright
was
the
day
on
which
I
did
so
!
<EOS>
Feeder
!
<EOS>
Nobody
but
myself
can
tell
what
the
capacity
of
that
woman
's
mind
is
.
<EOS>
If
ever
the
Rights
of
Women
,
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
,
are
properly
attended
to
,
it
will
be
through
her
powerful
intellect
.
<EOS>
---
Susan
,
my
dear
!
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
looking
abruptly
out
of
the
window
-
curtains
,
"
pray
do
not
exert
yourself
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Toots
,
"
I
was
only
talking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
love
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
pray
<EOS>
do
not
exert
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
really
must
be
careful
.
<EOS>
Do
not
,
my
dear
Susan
,
exert
yourself
.
<EOS>
She
's
so
easily
excited
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
apart
to
Mrs
Blimber
,
"
and
then
she
forgets
the
medical
man
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Blimber
was
impressing
on
Mrs
Toots
the
necessity
of
caution
,
when
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
,
offered
her
his
arm
,
and
led
her
down
to
the
carriages
that
were
in
waiting
to
go
to
church
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Blimber
escorted
Mrs
Toots
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
escorted
the
fair
bride
,
around
whose
lambent
spectacles
two
gauzy
little
bridesmaids
fluttered
like
moths
.
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
's
brother
,
Mr
Alfred
Feeder
,
MA
,
had
already
gone
on
,
in
advance
,
to
assume
his
official
functions
.
  
<EOS>
The
ceremony
was
performed
in
an
admirable
manner
.
<EOS>
Cornelia
,
with
her
crisp
little
curls
,
"
went
in
,
"
as
the
Chicken
might
have
said
,
with
great
composure
;
and
Doctor
Blimber
gave
her
away
,
like
a
man
who
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
gauzy
little
bridesmaids
appeared
to
suffer
most
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Blimber
was
affected
,
but
gently
so
;
and
told
the
Reverend
Mr
Alfred
Feeder
,
MA
,
on
the
way
home
,
that
if
she
could
only
have
seen
Cicero
in
his
retirement
at
Tusculum
,
she
would
not
have
had
a
wish
,
now
,
ungratified
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
breakfast
afterwards
,
limited
to
the
same
small
party
;
at
which
the
spirits
of
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
,
were
tremendous
,
and
so
communicated
themselves
to
Mrs
Toots
<EOS>
that
Mr
Toots
was
several
times
heard
to
observe
,
across
the
table
,
"
My
dear
Susan
,
do
n't
exert
yourself
!
"
<EOS>
The
best
of
it
was
,
that
Mr
Toots
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
to
make
a
speech
;
and
in
spite
of
a
whole
code
of
telegraphic
dissuasions
from
Mrs
Toots
,
appeared
on
his
legs
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
really

said
Mr
Toots
,
"
in
this
house

done

the
way

of
any
mental
confusion
sometimes

which
is
of
no
consequence

I
impute
to
nobody
<EOS>

I
was
always
treated

period

It

uninteresting

said
Mr
Toots
with
a
delighted
face
,
"
to
observe
that

is
a
most
extraordinary
woman

suggested

to

<EOS>
"
  
"
To
Mrs

said
Mr
Toots
,
in
a
subdued
tone
of
private
discussion
:
"
"
whom
God
hath
joined
,
"
you
know

<EOS>
do

I
can
not
allow
my
friend

to
be
married

especially
to
Mrs
Feeder

without
proposing
their

their
---
Toasts
;
and
may
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
fixing
his
eyes
on
his
wife
,
as
if
for
inspiration
in
a
high
flight
,
"
may
the
torch
of
Hymen
be
the
beacon
of
joy
,
and
may
the
flowers
we
have
this
day
strewed
in
their
path
,
be
the
---
the
banishers
of

of
gloom
!
"
  
<EOS>
Doctor
Blimber
,
who
had
a
taste
of
metaphor
,
was
pleased
with
this
,
and
said
,
"
Very
good
,
Toots
!
<EOS>
Very
well
said
,
indeed
,
Toots
!
"
and
nodded
his
head
and
patted
his
hands
.
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
made
in
reply
,
a
comic
speech
chequered
with
sentiment
.
<EOS>
Mr
Alfred
Feeder
,
MA
,
was
afterwards
very
happy
on
Doctor
and
Mrs
Blimber
;
Mr
Feeder

BA

scarcely

so

on
the
gauzy
little
bridesmaids

in
a
sonorous
voice
,
delivered
a
few
thoughts
in
the
pastoral
style
,
relative
to
the
rushes
among
which
it
was
the
intention
of
himself
and
Mrs
Blimber
to
dwell
,
and
the
bee
that
would
hum
around
their
cot
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
which
,
as
the
Doctor
's
eyes
were
twinkling
in
a
remarkable
manner
,
and
his
son
-
in
-
law
had
already
observed
that
time
was
made
for
slaves
,
and
had
inquired
whether
Mrs
Toots
sang
,
the
discreet
Mrs
Blimber
dissolved
the
sitting
,
and
sent
Cornelia
away
,
very
cool
and
comfortable
,
in
a
postchaise
,
with
the
man
of
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Toots
withdrew
to
the
Bedford
(
Mrs
Toots
had
been
there
before
in
old
times
,
under
her
maiden
name
of
Nipper
)
,
and
there
found
a
letter
,
which
it
took
Mr
Toots
such
an
enormous
time
to
read
,
that
Mrs
Toots
was
frightened
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Susan
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
<EOS>
"
fright
is
worse
than
exertion
.
<EOS>
Pray
be
calm
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
from
?
"
asked
Mrs
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
love
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
it
's
from
Captain
Gills
.
<EOS>
Do
not
excite
yourself
.
<EOS>
Walters
and
Miss
Dombey
are
expected
home
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Toots
,
raising
herself
quickly
from
the
sofa
,
very
pale
,
"
do
n't
try
to
deceive
me
,
<EOS>
for
it
's
no
use
,
they
're
come
home
---
<EOS>
I
see
it
plainly
in
your
face
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
most
extraordinary
woman
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mr
Toots
,
in
rapturous
admiration
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
perfectly
right
,
my
love
,
they
have
come
home
.
<EOS>
Miss
Dombey
has
seen
her
father
,
and
they
are
reconciled
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Reconciled
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Toots
,
clapping
her
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
;
"
pray
do
not
exert
yourself
.
<EOS>
Do
remember
the
medical
man
!
<EOS>
Captain
Gills
says
---
at
least
he
do
n't
say
,
but
I
imagine
,
from
what
I
can
make
out
,
he
means
---
that
Miss
Dombey
has
brought
her
unfortunate
father
away
from
his
old
house
,
to
one
where
she
and
Walters
are
living
;
that
he
is
lying
very
ill
there
---
supposed
to
be
dying
;
and
that
she
attends
upon
him
night
and
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Toots
began
to
cry
quite
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Susan
,
"
replied
Mr
Toots
,
"
do
,
do
,
if
you
possibly
can
,
remember
the
medical
man
!
<EOS>
If
you
ca
n't
,
it
's
of
no
consequence
---
but
do
endeavour
to
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
wife
,
with
her
old
manner
suddenly
resorted
,
so
pathetically
entreated
him
to
take
her
to
her
precious
pet
,
her
little
mistress
,
her
own
darling
,
and
the
like
,
that
Mr
Toots
,
whose
sympathy
and
admiration
were
of
the
strongest
kind
,
consented
from
his
very
heart
of
hearts
;
and
they
agreed
to
depart
immediately
,
and
present
themselves
in
answer
to
the
Captain
's
letter
.
  
<EOS>
Now
some
hidden
sympathies
of
things
,
or
some
coincidences
,
had
that
day
brought
the
Captain
himself
(
toward
whom
Mr
and
Mrs
Toots
were
soon
journeying
)
into
the
flowery
train
of
wedlock
;
not
as
a
principal
,
but
as
an
accessory
.
<EOS>
It
happened
accidentally
,
and
thus
:
  
The
Captain
,
having
seen
Florence
and
her
baby
for
a
moment
,
to
his
unbounded
content
,
and
having
had
a
long
talk
with
Walter
,
turned
out
for
a
walk
;
feeling
it
necessary
to
have
some
solitary
meditation
on
the
changes
of
human
affairs
,
and
to
shake
his
glazed
hat
profoundly
over
the
fall
of
Mr
Dombey
,
for
whom
the
generosity
and
simplicity
of
his
nature
were
awakened
in
a
lively
manner
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
would
have
been
very
low
,
indeed
,
on
the
unhappy
gentleman
's
account
,
but
for
the
recollection
of
the
baby
;
which
afforded
him
such
intense
satisfaction
whenever
it
arose
,
that
he
laughed
aloud
as
he
went
along
the
street
,
and
,
indeed
,
more
than
once
,
in
a
sudden
impulse
of
joy
,
threw
up
his
glazed
hat
and
caught
it
again
;
much
to
the
amazement
of
the
spectators
.
<EOS>
The
rapid
alternations
of
light
and
shade
to
which
these
two
conflicting
subjects
of
reflection
exposed
the
Captain
,
were
so
very
trying
to
his
spirits
,
that
he
felt
a
long
walk
necessary
to
his
composure
;
and
as
there
is
a
great
deal
in
the
influence
of
harmonious
associations
,
he
chose
,
for
the
scene
of
this
walk
,
his
old
neighbourhood
,
down
among
the
mast
,
oar
,
and
block
makers
,
ship
-
biscuit
bakers
,
coal
-
whippers
,
pitch
-
kettles
,
sailors
,
canals
,
docks
,
swing
-
bridges
,
and
other
soothing
objects
.
   
<EOS>
These
peaceful
scenes
,
and
particularly
the
region
of
Lime
-
house
Hole
and
thereabouts
,
were
so
influential
in
calming
the
Captain
,
that
he
walked
on
with
restored
tranquillity
,
and
was
,
in
fact
,
regaling
himself
,
under
his
breath
,
with
the
ballad
of
Lovely
Peg
,
when
,
on
turning
a
corner
,
he
was
suddenly
transfixed
and
rendered
speechless
by
a
triumphant
procession
that
he
beheld
advancing
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
This
awful
demonstration
was
headed
by
that
determined
woman
,
Mrs
MacStinger
,
who
,
preserving
a
countenance
of
inexorable
resolution
,
and
wearing
conspicuously
attached
to
her
obdurate
bosom
<EOS>
a
stupendous
watch
and
appendages
,
which
the
Captain
recognised
at
a
glance
as
the
property
of
Bunsby
,
conducted
under
her
arm
<EOS>
no
other
than
that
sagacious
mariner
;
he
,
with
the
distraught
and
melancholy
visage
of
a
captive
borne
into
a
foreign
land
,
meekly
resigning
himself
to
her
will
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
appeared
the
young
MacStingers
,
in
a
body
,
exulting
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
,
two
ladies
of
a
terrible
and
steadfast
aspect
,
leading
between
them
a
short
gentleman
in
a
tall
hat
,
who
likewise
exulted
.
<EOS>
In
the
wake
,
appeared
Bunsby
's
boy
,
bearing
umbrellas
.
<EOS>
The
whole
were
in
good
marching
order
;
and
a
dreadful
smartness
that
pervaded
the
party
would
have
sufficiently
announced
,
if
the
intrepid
countenances
of
the
ladies
had
been
wanting
,
that
it
was
a
procession
of
sacrifice
,
and
that
the
victim
was
Bunsby
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
impulse
of
the
Captain
was
to
run
away
.
<EOS>
This
also
appeared
to
be
the
first
impulse
of
Bunsby
,
hopeless
as
its
execution
must
have
proved
.
<EOS>
But
a
cry
of
recognition
proceeding
from
the
party
,
and
Alexander
MacStinger
running
up
to
the
Captain
with
open
arms
,
the
Captain
struck
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Cap'en
Cuttle
!
"
said
Mrs
MacStinger
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
indeed
a
meeting
!
<EOS>
I
bear
no
malice
now
.
<EOS>
Cap'en
Cuttle
---
you
need
n't
fear
that
I
'm
a
going
to
cast
any
reflections
.
<EOS>
I
hope
to
go
to
the
altar
in
another
spirit
.
"
<EOS>
Here
Mrs
MacStinger
paused
,
and
drawing
herself
up
,
and
inflating
her
bosom
with
a
long
breath
,
said
,
in
allusion
to
the
victim
,
"
<EOS>
My
'
usband
,
Cap'en
Cuttle
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
abject
Bunsby
looked
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
,
nor
at
his
bride
,
nor
at
his
friend
,
but
straight
before
him
at
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
putting
out
his
hand
,
Bunsby
put
out
his
;
but
,
in
answer
to
the
Captain
's
greeting
,
spake
no
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cap'en
Cuttle
,
"
said
Mrs
MacStinger
,
"
if
you
would
wish
to
heal
up
past
animosities
,
and
to
see
the
last
of
your
friend
,
my
'
usband
,
as
a
single
person
,
we
should
be
'
appy
of
your
company
to
chapel
.
<EOS>
Here
is
a
lady
here
,
"
said
Mrs
MacStinger
,
turning
round
to
the
more
intrepid
of
the
two
<EOS>
,
"
my
bridesmaid
,
that
will
be
glad
of
your
protection
,
Cap'en
Cuttle
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
short
gentleman
in
the
tall
hat
,
who
it
appeared
was
the
husband
of
the
other
lady
,
and
who
evidently
exulted
at
the
reduction
of
a
fellow
-
creature
to
his
own
condition
,
gave
place
at
this
,
and
resigned
the
lady
to
Captain
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
The
lady
immediately
seized
him
,
and
,
observing
that
there
was
no
tome
to
lose
,
gave
the
word
,
in
a
strong
voice
,
to
advance
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
's
concern
for
his
friend
,
not
unmingled
,
at
first
,
with
some
concern
for
himself
---
for
a
shadowy
terror
that
he
might
be
married
by
violence
,
possessed
him
,
until
his
knowledge
of
the
service
came
to
his
relief
,
and
remembering
the
legal
obligation
of
saying
,
"
I
will
,
"
he
felt
himself
personally
safe
so
long
as
he
resolved
,
if
asked
any
question
,
distinctly
to
reply
"
I
wo
n't
"
---
threw
him
into
a
profuse
perspiration
;
and
rendered
him
,
for
a
time
,
insensible
to
the
movements
of
the
procession
,
of
which
he
now
formed
a
feature
,
and
to
the
conversation
of
his
fair
companion
.
<EOS>
But
as
he
became
less
agitated
,
he
learnt
from
this
lady
that
she
was
the
widow
of
a
Mr
Bokum
,
who
had
held
and
employment
in
the
Custom
House
;
that
she
was
the
dearest
friend
of
Mrs
MacStinger
,
whom
she
considered
a
pattern
for
her
sex
;
that
she
had
often
heard
of
the
Captain
,
and
now
hoped
he
had
repented
of
his
past
life
;
that
she
trusted
<EOS>
Mr
Bunsby
knew
what
a
blessing
he
had
gained
,
but
that
she
feared
men
seldom
did
know
what
such
blessings
were
,
until
they
had
lost
them
;
with
more
to
the
same
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
the
Captain
could
not
but
observe
that
Mrs
Bokum
kept
her
eyes
steadily
on
the
bridegroom
,
and
that
whenever
they
came
near
a
court
or
other
narrow
turning
which
appeared
favourable
for
flight
,
she
was
on
the
alert
to
cut
him
off
if
he
attempted
escape
.
<EOS>
The
other
lady
,
too
,
as
well
as
her
husband
,
the
short
gentleman
with
the
tall
hat
,
were
plainly
on
guard
,
according
to
a
preconcerted
plan
;
and
the
wretched
man
was
so
secured
by
Mrs
MacStinger
,
that
any
effort
at
self
-
preservation
by
flight
was
rendered
futile
.
<EOS>
This
,
indeed
,
was
apparent
to
the
mere
populace
,
who
expressed
their
perception
of
the
fact
by
jeers
and
cries
;
to
all
of
which
,
the
dread
MacStinger
was
inflexibly
indifferent
,
while
Bunsby
himself
appeared
in
a
state
of
unconsciousness
.
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
made
many
attempts
to
accost
the
philosopher
,
if
only
in
a
monosyllable
or
a
signal
;
but
always
failed
,
in
consequence
of
the
vigilance
of
the
guard
,
and
the
difficulty
,
at
all
times
peculiar
to
Bunsby
's
constitution
,
of
having
his
attention
aroused
by
any
outward
any
visible
sign
whatever
.
<EOS>
Thus
they
approached
the
chapel
,
a
neat
whitewashed
edifice
,
recently
engaged
by
the
Reverend
Melchisedech
Howler
,
who
had
consented
,
on
very
urgent
solicitation
,
to
give
the
world
another
two
years
of
existence
,
but
had
informed
his
followers
that
,
then
,
it
must
positively
go
.
  
<EOS>
While
the
Reverend
Melchisedech
was
offering
up
some
extemporary
orisons
,
the
Captain
found
an
opportunity
of
growling
in
the
bridegroom
's
ear
:
  
<EOS>
"
What
cheer
,
my
lad
,
what
cheer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
which
Bunsby
replied
,
with
a
forgetfulness
of
the
Reverend
Melchisedech
,
which
nothing
but
his
desperate
circumstances
could
have
excused
:
  
"
D
---
d
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jack
Bunsby
,
"
whispered
the
Captain
,
"
do
you
do
this
here
,
o
'
your
own
free
will
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Bunsby
answered
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
do
it
,
then
,
my
lad
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
Captain
,
not
unnaturally
.
  
<EOS>
Bunsby
,
still
looking
,
and
always
looking
with
an
immovable
countenance
,
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
world
,
made
no
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
sheer
off
?
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
"
whispered
Bunsby
,
with
a
momentary
gleam
of
hope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sheer
off
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
's
the
good
?
<EOS>
"
retorted
the
forlorn
sage
.
<EOS>
"
She
'd
capter
me
agen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Try
!
"
replied
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
Cheer
up
!
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
Now
's
your
time
.
<EOS>
Sheer
off
,
Jack
Bunsby
!
"
  
<EOS>
Jack
Bunsby
,
however
,
instead
of
profiting
by
the
advice
,
said
in
a
doleful
whisper
:
  
"
It
all
began
in
that
there
chest
o
'
yourn
.
<EOS>
Why
did
I
ever
conwoy
her
into
port
that
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lad
,
"
faltered
the
Captain
,
"
I
thought
as
you
had
come
over
her
;
nor
as
she
had
come
over
you
.
<EOS>
A
man
as
has
got
such
opinions
as
you
have
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Bunsby
merely
uttered
a
suppressed
groan
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
said
the
Captain
,
nudging
him
with
his
elbow
,
"
now
's
your
time
!
<EOS>
Sheer
off
!
<EOS>
I
'll
cover
your
retreat
.
<EOS>
The
time
's
a
flying
.
<EOS>
Bunsby
!
<EOS>
It
's
for
liberty
.
<EOS>
Will
you
once
?
"
  
<EOS>
Bunsby
was
immovable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bunsby
!
"
whispered
the
Captain
,
"
will
you
twice
?
"
  
<EOS>
Bunsby
would
n't
twice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bunsby
!
"
urged
the
Captain
,
"
it
's
for
liberty
;
will
you
three
times
?
<EOS>
Now
or
never
!
"
  
<EOS>
Bunsby
did
n't
then
,
and
did
n't
ever
;
for
Mrs
MacStinger
immediately
afterwards
married
him
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
the
most
frightful
circumstances
of
the
ceremony
to
the
Captain
,
was
the
deadly
interest
exhibited
therein
by
Juliana
MacStinger
;
and
the
fatal
concentration
of
her
faculties
,
with
which
that
promising
child
,
already
the
image
of
her
parent
,
observed
the
whole
proceedings
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
saw
in
this
a
succession
of
man
-
traps
stretching
out
infinitely
;
a
series
of
ages
of
oppression
and
coercion
,
through
which
the
seafaring
line
was
doomed
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
more
memorable
sight
than
the
unflinching
steadiness
of
Mrs
Bokum
and
the
other
lady
,
the
exultation
of
the
short
gentleman
in
the
tall
hat
,
or
even
the
fell
inflexibility
of
Mrs
MacStinger
.
<EOS>
The
Master
MacStingers
understood
little
of
what
was
going
on
,
and
cared
less
;
being
chiefly
engaged
,
during
the
ceremony
,
in
treading
on
one
another
's
half
-
boots
;
but
the
contrast
afforded
by
those
wretched
infants
only
set
off
and
adorned
the
precocious
woman
in
Juliana
.
<EOS>
Another
year
or
two
,
the
Captain
thought
,
and
to
lodge
where
that
child
was
,
would
be
destruction
.
  
<EOS>
The
ceremony
was
concluded
by
a
general
spring
of
the
young
family
on
Mr
Bunsby
,
whom
they
hailed
by
the
endearing
name
of
father
,
and
from
whom
they
solicited
half
-
pence
.
<EOS>
These
gushes
of
affection
over
,
the
procession
was
about
to
issue
forth
again
,
when
it
was
delayed
for
some
little
time
by
an
unexpected
transport
on
the
part
of
Alexander
MacStinger
.
<EOS>
That
dear
child
,
it
seemed
,
connecting
a
chapel
with
tombstones
,
when
it
was
entered
for
any
purpose
apart
from
the
ordinary
religious
exercises
,
could
not
be
persuaded
but
that
his
mother
was
now
to
be
decently
interred
,
and
lost
to
him
for
ever
.
<EOS>
In
the
anguish
of
this
conviction
,
he
screamed
with
astonishing
force
,
and
turned
black
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
However
touching
these
marks
of
a
tender
disposition
were
to
his
mother
,
it
was
not
in
the
character
of
that
remarkable
woman
to
permit
her
recognition
of
them
to
degenerate
into
weakness
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
after
vainly
endeavouring
to
convince
his
reason
by
shakes
,
pokes
,
bawlings
-
out
,
and
similar
applications
to
his
head
,
she
led
him
into
the
air
,
and
tried
another
method
;
which
was
manifested
to
the
marriage
party
by
a
quick
succession
of
sharp
sounds
,
resembling
applause
,
and
subsequently
,
by
their
seeing
Alexander
in
contact
with
the
coolest
paving
-
stone
in
the
court
,
greatly
flushed
,
and
loudly
lamenting
.
  
<EOS>
The
procession
being
then
in
a
condition
to
from
itself
once
more
,
and
repair
to
Brig
Place
,
where
a
marriage
feast
was
in
readiness
,
returned
as
it
had
come
;
not
without
the
receipt
,
by
Bunsby
,
of
many
humorous
congratulations
from
the
populace
on
his
recently
-
acquired
happiness
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
accompanied
it
as
far
as
the
house
-
door
,
but
,
being
made
uneasy
by
the
gentler
manner
of
Mrs
Bokum
,
who
,
now
that
she
was
relieved
from
her
engrossing
duty
---
for
the
watchfulness
and
alacrity
of
the
ladies
sensibly
diminished
when
the
bridegroom
was
safely
married
---
had
greater
leisure
to
show
an
interest
in
his
behalf
,
there
left
it
and
the
captive
;
faintly
pleading
an
appointment
,
and
promising
to
return
presently
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
had
another
cause
for
uneasiness
,
in
remorsefully
reflecting
that
he
had
been
the
first
means
of
Bunsby
's
entrapment
,
though
certainly
without
intending
it
,
and
through
his
unbounded
faith
in
the
resources
of
that
philosopher
.
  
<EOS>
To
go
back
to
old
Sol
Gills
at
the
Wooden
Midshipman
's
,
and
not
first
go
round
to
ask
how
Mr
Dombey
fared
---
<EOS>
albeit
the
house
where
he
lay
was
out
of
London
,
and
away
on
the
borders
of
a
fresh
heath
---
was
quite
out
of
the
Captain
's
course
.
<EOS>
So
he
got
a
lift
when
he
was
tired
,
and
made
out
the
journey
gaily
.
  
<EOS>
The
blinds
were
pulled
down
,
and
the
house
so
quiet
,
that
the
Captain
was
almost
afraid
to
knock
;
but
listening
at
the
door
,
he
heard
low
voices
within
,
very
near
it
,
and
knocking
softly
,
was
admitted
by
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
and
his
wife
had
,
in
fact
,
just
arrived
there
;
having
been
at
the
Midshipman
's
to
seek
him
,
and
having
there
obtained
the
address
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
not
so
recently
arrived
,
but
that
Mrs
Toots
had
caught
the
baby
from
somebody
,
taken
it
in
her
arms
,
and
sat
down
on
the
stairs
,
hugging
and
fondling
it
.
<EOS>
Florence
was
stooping
down
beside
her
;
and
no
one
could
have
said
which
Mrs
Toots
was
hugging
and
fondling
most
,
the
mother
or
the
child
,
or
which
was
the
tenderer
,
Florence
of
Mrs
Toots
,
or
Mrs
Toots
of
her
,
or
both
of
the
baby
;
it
was
such
a
little
group
of
love
and
agitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
is
your
Pa
very
ill
,
my
darling
dear
Miss
Floy
?
"
asked
Susan
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
very
,
very
ill
,
"
said
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
Susan
,
dear
,
you
must
not
speak
to
me
as
you
used
to
speak
.
<EOS>
And
what
's
this
?
<EOS>
"
said
Florence
,
touching
her
clothes
,
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
old
dress
,
dear
?
<EOS>
Your
old
cap
,
curls
,
and
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
Susan
burst
into
tears
,
and
showered
kisses
on
the
little
hand
that
had
touched
her
so
wonderingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Dombey
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
stepping
forward
,
<EOS>
"
I
'll
explain
.
<EOS>
She
's
the
most
extraordinary
woman
.
<EOS>
There
are
not
many
to
equal
her
!
<EOS>
She
has
always
said
---
<EOS>
she
said
before
we
were
married
,
and
has
said
to
this
day
---
that
whenever
you
came
home
,
she
'd
come
to
you
in
no
dress
<EOS>
but
the
dress
she
used
to
serve
you
in
,
for
fear
she
might
seem
strange
to
you
,
and
you
might
like
her
less
.
<EOS>
I
admire
the
dress
myself
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
"
of
all
things
.
<EOS>
I
adore
her
in
it
!
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Dombey
,
she
'll
be
your
maid
again
,
your
nurse
,
all
that
she
ever
was
,
and
more
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
change
in
her
.
<EOS>
But
,
Susan
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Toots
,
who
had
spoken
with
great
feeling
and
high
admiration
,
"
all
I
ask
is
,
that
you
'll
remember
the
medical
man
,
and
not
exert
yourself
too
much
.

Chapter
61
.
<EOS>
Relenting
 
FLORENCE
had
need
of
help
.
<EOS>
Her
father
's
need
of
it
was
sore
,
and
made
the
aid
of
her
old
friend
invaluable
.
<EOS>
Death
stood
at
his
pillow
.
<EOS>
A
shade
,
already
,
of
what
he
had
been
,
shattered
in
mind
,
and
perilously
sick
in
body
,
he
laid
his
weary
head
down
on
the
bed
his
daughter
's
hands
prepared
for
him
,
and
had
never
raised
it
since
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
always
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
knew
her
,
generally
;
though
,
in
the
wandering
of
his
brain
,
he
often
confused
the
circumstances
under
which
he
spoke
to
her
.
<EOS>
Thus
he
would
address
her
,
sometimes
,
as
if
his
boy
were
newly
dead
;
and
would
tell
her
,
that
although
he
had
said
nothing
of
her
ministering
at
the
little
bedside
,
yet
he
had
seen
it
---
he
had
seen
it
;
and
then
would
hide
his
face
and
sob
,
and
put
out
his
worn
hand
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
would
ask
her
for
herself
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Florence
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
am
here
,
Papa
,
I
am
here
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
her
!
"
<EOS>
he
would
cry
"
We
have
been
parted
so
long
,
that
I
do
n't
know
her
!
"
<EOS>
and
and
then
a
staring
dread
would
be
upon
him
,
until
she
could
soothe
his
perturbation
;
and
recall
the
tears
she
tried
so
hard
,
at
other
times
,
to
dry
.
  
<EOS>
He
rambled
through
the
scenes
of
his
old
pursuits
---
through
many
where
Florence
lost
him
as
she
listened
---
sometimes
for
hours
.
<EOS>
He
would
repeat
that
childish
question
,
"
<EOS>
What
is
money
?
"
and
ponder
on
it
,
and
think
about
it
,
and
reason
with
himself
,
more
or
less
connectedly
,
for
a
good
answer
;
as
if
it
had
never
been
proposed
to
him
until
that
moment
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
on
with
a
musing
repetition
of
the
title
of
his
old
firm
twenty
thousand
times
,
and
at
every
one
of
them
,
would
turn
his
head
upon
his
pillow
.
<EOS>
He
would
count
his
children
---
one
---
two
---
stop
,
and
go
back
,
and
begin
again
in
the
same
way
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
was
when
his
mind
was
in
its
most
distracted
state
.
<EOS>
In
all
the
other
phases
of
its
illness
,
and
in
those
to
which
it
was
most
constant
,
it
always
turned
on
Florence
.
<EOS>
What
he
would
oftenest
do
was
this
<EOS>
:
he
would
recall
that
night
<EOS>
he
had
so
recently
remembered
,
the
night
on
which
she
came
down
to
his
room
,
and
would
imagine
that
his
heart
smote
him
,
and
that
he
went
out
after
her
,
and
up
the
stairs
to
seek
her
.
<EOS>
Then
,
confounding
that
time
with
the
later
days
of
the
many
footsteps
,
he
would
be
amazed
at
their
number
,
and
begin
to
count
them
as
he
followed
her
.
<EOS>
Here
,
of
a
sudden
,
was
a
bloody
footstep
going
on
among
the
others
;
and
after
it
there
began
to
be
,
at
intervals
,
doors
standing
open
,
through
which
certain
terrible
pictures
were
seen
,
in
mirrors
,
of
haggard
men
,
concealing
something
in
their
breasts
.
<EOS>
Still
,
among
the
many
footsteps
and
the
bloody
footsteps
here
and
there
,
was
the
step
of
Florence
.
<EOS>
Still
she
was
going
on
before
.
<EOS>
Still
the
restless
mind
went
,
following
and
counting
,
ever
farther
,
ever
higher
,
as
to
the
summit
of
a
mighty
tower
that
it
took
years
to
climb
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
he
inquired
if
that
were
not
Susan
who
had
spoken
a
long
while
ago
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
said
"
Yes
,
dear
Papa
;
"
and
asked
him
would
he
like
to
see
her
?
  
<EOS>
He
said
"
very
much
.
"
<EOS>
And
Susan
,
with
no
little
trepidation
,
showed
herself
at
his
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
a
great
relief
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
begged
her
not
to
go
;
to
understand
that
he
forgave
her
what
she
had
said
;
and
that
she
was
to
stay
.
<EOS>
Florence
and
he
were
very
different
now
,
he
said
,
and
very
happy
.
<EOS>
Let
her
look
at
this
!
<EOS>
He
meant
his
drawing
gentle
head
down
to
his
pillow
,
and
laying
it
beside
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
remained
like
this
for
days
and
weeks
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
lying
,
the
faint
feeble
semblance
of
a
man
,
upon
his
bed
,
and
speaking
in
a
voice
so
low
that
they
could
only
hear
him
by
listening
very
near
to
his
lips
,
he
became
quiet
.
<EOS>
It
was
dimly
pleasant
to
him
now
,
to
lie
their
,
with
the
window
open
,
looking
out
at
the
summer
sky
and
the
trees
:
and
,
in
the
evening
,
at
the
sunset
.
<EOS>
To
watch
the
shadows
of
the
clouds
and
leaves
,
and
seem
to
feel
a
sympathy
with
shadows
.
<EOS>
It
was
natural
that
he
should
.
<EOS>
To
him
,
life
and
the
world
were
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
He
began
to
show
now
that
he
thought
of
Florence
's
fatigue
:
and
often
taxed
his
weakness
to
whisper
to
her
,
"
Go
and
walk
,
<EOS>
my
dearest
,
in
the
sweet
air
,
Go
to
your
good
husband
!
"
<EOS>
One
time
when
Walter
was
in
his
room
,
he
beckoned
him
to
come
near
,
and
to
stoop
down
;
and
pressing
his
hand
,
whispered
an
assurance
to
him
that
he
knew
he
could
trust
him
with
his
child
when
he
was
dead
.
  
<EOS>
It
chanced
one
evening
,
towards
sunset
,
when
Florence
and
Walter
were
sitting
in
his
room
together
,
as
he
liked
to
see
them
,
that
Florence
,
having
her
baby
in
her
arms
,
began
in
a
low
voice
to
sing
to
the
little
fellow
,
and
sang
the
old
tune
she
had
so
often
sung
to
the
dead
child
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
it
at
the
time
;
he
held
up
his
trembling
hand
,
imploring
her
to
stop
;
but
next
day
he
asked
her
to
repeat
it
,
and
to
do
so
often
of
an
evening
:
which
she
did
.
<EOS>
He
listening
,
with
his
face
turned
away
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
was
sitting
on
a
certain
time
by
his
window
,
with
her
work
-
basket
between
her
and
her
old
attendant
,
who
was
still
her
faithful
companion
.
<EOS>
He
had
fallen
into
a
doze
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
beautiful
evening
,
with
two
hours
of
light
to
come
yet
;
and
the
tranquillity
and
quiet
made
Florence
very
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
She
was
lost
to
everything
for
the
moment
,
but
the
occasion
when
the
so
altered
figure
on
the
bed
had
first
presented
her
to
her
beautiful
mama
;
when
a
touch
from
Walter
leaning
on
the
back
of
her
chair
,
made
her
start
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
there
is
some
one
down
stairs
who
wishes
to
speak
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
fancied
Walter
looked
grave
,
and
asked
him
if
anything
had
happened
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
my
love
!
"
said
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
the
gentleman
myself
,
and
spoken
with
him
.
<EOS>
Nothing
has
happened
.
<EOS>
Will
you
come
?
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
put
her
arm
through
his
;
and
confiding
her
father
to
the
black
-
eyed
Mrs
Toots
,
who
sat
as
brisk
and
smart
at
her
work
as
black
-
eyed
woman
could
,
accompanied
her
husband
down
stairs
.
<EOS>
In
the
pleasant
little
parlour
opening
on
the
garden
,
sat
a
gentleman
,
who
rose
to
advance
towards
her
when
she
came
in
,
but
turned
off
,
by
reason
of
some
peculiarity
in
his
legs
,
and
was
only
stopped
by
the

Florence
then
remembered
Cousin
Feenix
,
whom
she
had
not
at
first
recognised
in
the
shade
of
the
leaves
.
<EOS>
Cousin
Feenix
took
her
hand
,
and
congratulated
her
upon
her
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
have
wished
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Cousin
Feenix
,
sitting
down
as
Florence
sat
,
"
to
have
had
an
earlier
opportunity
of
offering
my
congratulations
;
but
,
in
point
of
fact
,
so
many
painful
occurrences
have
happened
,
treading
,
as
a
man
may
say
,
on
one
another
's
heels
,
that
I
have
been
in
a
devil
of
a
state
myself
,
and
perfectly
unfit
for
every
description
of
society
.
<EOS>
The
only
description
of
society
I
have
kept
,
has
been
my
own
;
and
it
certainly
is
anything
but
flattering
to
a
man
's
good
opinion
of
his
own
resources
,
to
know
that
,
in
point
of
fact
,
he
has
the
capacity
of
boring
himself
to
a
perfectly
unlimited
extent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
divined
,
from
some
indefinable
constraint
and
anxiety
in
this
gentleman
's
manner
---
which
was
always
a
gentleman
's
,
in
spite
of
the
harmless
little
eccentricities
that
attached
to
it
---
and
from
Walter
's
manner
no
less
,
that
something
more
immediately
tending
to
some
object
was
to
follow
this
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
mentioning
to
my
friend
Mr
Gay
,
if
I
may
be
allowed
to
have
the
honour
of
calling
him
so
,
"
said
Cousin
Feenix
,
"
that
I
am
rejoiced
to
hear
that
my
friend
Dombey
is
very
decidedly
mending
.
<EOS>
I
trust
my
friend
Dombey
will
not
allow
his
mind
to
be
too
much
preyed
upon
,
by
any
mere
loss
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
I
have
ever
experienced
any
very
great
loss
of
fortune
myself
:
never
having
had
,
in
point
of
fact
,
any
great
amount
of
fortune
to
lose
.
<EOS>
But
as
much
as
I
could
lose
,
I
have
lost
;
and
I
do
n't
find
that
I
particularly
care
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
friend
Dombey
to
be
a
devilish
honourable
man
;
and
it
's
calculated
to
console
my
friend
Dombey
very
much
,
to
know
,
that
this
is
the
universal
sentiment
.
<EOS>
Even
Tommy
Screwzer
,
---
a
man
of
an
extremely
bilious
habit
,
with
whom
my
friend
Gay
is
probably
acquainted
---
can
not
say
a
syllable
in
disputation
of
the
fact
.
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
felt
,
more
than
ever
,
that
there
was
something
to
come
;
and
looked
earnestly
for
it
.
<EOS>
So
earnestly
,
that
Cousin
Feenix
answered
,
as
if
she
had
spoken
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
"
said
Cousin
Feenix
,
"
that
my
friend
Gay
and
myself
have
been
discussing
the
propriety
of
entreating
a
favour
at
your
hands
;
and
that
I
have
the
consent
of
my
friend
Gay
---
who
has
met
me
in
an
exceedingly
kind
and
open
manner
,
for
which
I
am
very
much
indebted
to
him
---
to
solicit
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
sensible
that
so
amiable
a
lady
as
the
lovely
and
accomplished
daughter
of
my
friend
Dombey
,
will
not
require
much
urging
;
but
I
am
happy
to
know
,
that
I
am
supported
by
my
friend
Gay
's
influence
and
approval
.
<EOS>
As
in
my
parliamentary
time
,
when
a
man
had
a
motion
to
make
of
any
sort
---
which
happened
seldom
in
those
days
,
for
we
were
kept
very
tight
in
hand
,
the
leaders
on
both
sides
being
regular
Martinets
,
which
was
a
devilish
good
thing
for
the
rank
and
file
,
like
myself
,
and
prevented
our
exposing
ourselves
continually
,
as
a
great
many
of
us
had
a
feverish
anxiety
to
do
---
as
,
in
my
parliamentary
time
,
I
was
about
to
say
,
when
a
man
had
leave
to
let
off
any
little
private
popgun
,
it
was
always
considered
a
great
point
for
him
to
say
that
he
had
the
happiness
of
believing
that
his
sentiments
were
not
without
an
echo
in
the
breast
of
Mr
Pitt
;
the
pilot
,
in
point
of
fact
,
who
had
weathered
the
storm
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
a
devilish
large
number
of
fellows
immediately
cheered
,
and
put
him
in
spirits
.
<EOS>
Though
the
fact
is
,
that
these
fellows
,
being
under
orders
to
cheer
most
excessively
whenever
Mr
Pitt
's
name
was
mentioned
,
became
so
proficient
that
it
always
woke'em
.
<EOS>
And
they
were
so
entirely
innocent
of
what
was
going
on
,
otherwise
,
that
it
used
to
be
commonly
said
by
Conversation
Brown
---
four
-
bottle
man
at
the
Treasury
Board
,
with
whom
the
father
of
my
friend
Gay
was
probably
acquainted
,
for
it
was
before
my
friend
<EOS>
Gay
's
time
---
that
if
a
man
had
risen
in
his
place
,
and
said
that
he
regretted
to
inform
the
house
that
there
was
an
Honourable
Member
in
the
last
stage
of
convulsions
in
the
Lobby
,
and
that
the
Honourable
Member
's
name
was
Pitt
,
the
approbation
would
have
been
vociferous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
postponement
of
the
point
,
put
Florence
in
a
flutter
;
and
she
looked
from
Cousin
Feenix
to
Walter
,
in
increasing
agitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
"
said
Walter
,
"
there
is
nothing
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
the
matter
,
upon
my
honour
,
"
said
Cousin
Feenix
;
"
and
I
am
deeply
distressed
at
being
the
means
of
causing
you
a
moment
's
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
I
beg
to
assure
you
that
there
is
nothing
the
matter
.
<EOS>
The
favour
that
I
have
to
ask
is
,
simply
---
but
it
really
does
seem
so
exceeding
singular
,
that
I
should
be
in
the
last
degree
obliged
to
my
friend
Gay
if
he
would
have
the
goodness
to
break
the
---
in
point
of
fact
,
the
ice
,
"
said
Cousin
Feenix
.
  
<EOS>
Walter
thus
appealed
to
,
and
appealed
to
no
less
in
the
look
that
Florence
turned
towards
him
,
said
:
  
"
My
dearest
,
it
is
no
more
than
this
.
<EOS>
That
you
will
ride
to
London
with
this
gentleman
,
whom
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
my
friend
Gay
,
also
---
I
beg
your
pardon
!
"
interrupted
Cousin
Feenix
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
And
with
me
---
and
make
a
visit
somewhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
whom
?
"
asked
Florence
,
looking
from
one
to
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
might
entreat
,
"
said
Cousin
Feenix
,
"
that
you
would
not
press
for
an
answer
to
that
question
,
I
would
venture
to
take
the
liberty
of
making
the
request
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
Walter
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
"
And
think
it
right
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Only
because
I
am
sure
that
you
would
too
.
<EOS>
Though
there
may
be
reasons
I
very
well
understand
,
which
make
it
better
that
nothing
more
should
be
said
beforehand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
Papa
is
still
asleep
,
or
can
spare
me
if
he
is
awake
,
I
will
go
immediately
,
"
said
Florence
.
<EOS>
And
rising
quietly
,
and
glancing
at
them
with
a
look
that
was
a
little
alarmed
but
perfectly
confiding
,
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
came
back
,
ready
to
bear
them
company
,
they
were
talking
together
,
gravely
,
at
the
window
;
and
Florence
could
not
but
wonder
what
the
topic
was
,
that
had
made
them
so
well
acquainted
in
so
short
a
time
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
wonder
at
the
look
of
pride
and
love
with
which
her
husband
broke
off
as
she
entered
;
for
she
never
saw
him
,
but
that
rested
on
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
leave
,
"
said
Cousin
Feenix
,
"
a
card
for
my
friend
Dombey
,
sincerely
trusting
that
he
will
pick
up
health
and
strength
with
every
returning
hour
.
<EOS>
And
I
hope
my
friend
Dombey
will
do
me
the
favour
to
consider
me
a
man
who
has
a
devilish
warm
admiration
of
his
character
,
as
,
in
point
of
fact
,
a
British
merchant
and
a
devilish
upright
gentleman
.
<EOS>
My
place
in
the
country
is
in
a
most
confounded
state
of
dilapidation
,
but
if
my
friend
Dombey
should
require
a
change
of
air
,
and
would
take
up
his
quarters
there
,
he
would
find
it
a
remarkably
healthy
spot
---
<EOS>
as
it
need
be
,
for
it
's
amazingly
dull
.
<EOS>
If
my
friend
Dombey
suffers
from
bodily
weakness
,
and
would
allow
me
to
recommend
what
has
frequently
done
myself
good
,
as
a
man
who
has
been
extremely
queer
at
times
,
and
who
lived
pretty
freely
in
the
days
when
men
lived
very
freely
<EOS>
,
I
should
say
,
let
it
be
in
point
of
fact
the
yolk
of
an
egg
,
beat
up
with
sugar
and
nutmeg
,
in
a
glass
of
sherry
,
and
taken
in
the
morning
with
a
slice
of
dry
toast
.
<EOS>
Jackson
,
who
kept
the
boxing
-
rooms
in
Bond
Street
---
man
of
very
superior
qualifications
,
with
whose
reputation
my
friend
Gay
is
no
doubt
acquainted
---
used
to
mention
that
in
training
for
the
ring
they
substituted
rum
for
sherry
.
<EOS>
I
should
recommend
sherry
in
this
case
,
on
account
of
my
friend
Dombey
being
in
an
invalided
condition
;
which
might
occasion
rum
to
fly
---
in
point
of
fact
to
his
head
---
and
throw
him
into
a
devil
of
a
state
.
"
  
<EOS>
Of
all
this
,
Cousin
Feenix
delivered
himself
with
an
obviously
nervous
and
discomposed
air
.
<EOS>
Then
,
giving
his
arm
to
Florence
,
and
putting
the
strongest
possible
constraint
upon
his
wilful
legs
,
which
seemed
determined
to
go
out
into
the
garden
,
he
led
her
to
the
door
,
and
handed
her
into
a
carriage
that
was
ready
for
her
reception
.
  
<EOS>
Walter
entered
after
him
,
and
they
drove
away
.
  
<EOS>
Their
ride
was
six
or
eight
miles
long
.
<EOS>
When
they
drove
through
certain
dull
and
stately
streets
,
lying
westward
in
London
,
it
was
growing
dusk
.
<EOS>
Florence
had
,
by
this
time
,
put
her
hand
in
Walter
's
;
and
was
looking
very
earnestly
,
and
with
increasing
agitation
,
into
every
new
street
into
which
they
turned
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
carriage
stopped
,
at
last
,
before
that
house
in
Brook
street
,
where
her
father
's
unhappy
marriage
had
been
celebrated
,
Florence
said
,
"
Walter
,
what
is
this
?
<EOS>
Who
is
here
?
"
<EOS>
Walter
cheering
her
,
and
not
replying
,
she
glanced
up
at
the
house
-
front
,
and
saw
that
all
the
windows
were
shut
,
as
if
it
were
uninhabited
.
<EOS>
Cousin
Feenix
had
by
this
time
alighted
,
and
was
offering
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
not
coming
,
Walter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
will
remain
here
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
tremble
!
<EOS>
there
is
nothing
to
fear
,
dearest
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
,
Walter
,
with
you
so
near
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
of
that
,
but
"
  
The
door
was
softly
opened
,
without
any
knock
,
and
Cousin
Feenix
led
her
out
of
the
summer
evening
air
into
the
close
dull
house
.
<EOS>
More
sombre
and
brown
than
ever
,
it
seemed
to
have
been
shut
up
from
the
wedding
-
day
,
and
to
have
hoarded
darkness
and
sadness
ever
since
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
ascended
the
dusky
staircase
,
trembling
;
and
stopped
,
with
her
conductor
,
at
the
drawing
-
room
door
.
<EOS>
He
opened
it
,
without
speaking
,
and
signed
an
entreaty
to
her
to
advance
into
the
inner
room
,
while
he
remained
there
.
<EOS>
Florence
,
after
hesitating
an
instant
,
compiled
.
  
<EOS>
Sitting
by
the
window
at
a
table
,
where
she
seemed
to
have
been
writing
or
drawing
,
was
a
lady
,
whose
head
,
turned
away
towards
the
dying
light
,
was
resting
on
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Florence
advancing
,
doubtfully
,
all
at
once
stood
still
,
as
if
she
had
lost
the
power
of
motion
.
<EOS>
The
lady
turned
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Great
Heaven
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
What
is
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Florence
,
shrinking
back
as
she
rose
up
and
putting
out
her
hands
to
keep
her
off
.
<EOS>
"
Mama
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
stood
looking
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
Passion
and
pride
had
worn
it
,
but
it
was
the
face
of
Edith
,
and
beautiful
and
stately
yet
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
face
of
Florence
,
and
through
all
the
terrified
avoidance
it
expressed
,
there
was
pity
in
it
,
sorrow
,
a
grateful
tender
memory
.
<EOS>
On
each
face
,
wonder
and
fear
were
painted
vividly
;
each
so
still
and
silent
,
looking
at
the
other
over
the
black
gulf
of
the
irrevocable
past
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
was
the
first
to
change
.
<EOS>
Bursting
into
tears
,
she
said
from
her
full
heart
,
"
Oh
,
Mama
,
Mama
!
<EOS>
why
do
we
meet
like
this
?
<EOS>
Why
were
you
ever
kind
to
me
when
there
was
no
one
else
,
that
we
should
meet
like
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
stood
before
her
,
dumb
and
motionless
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
not
think
of
that
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
I
am
come
from
Papa
's
sick
bed
.
<EOS>
We
are
never
asunder
now
;
we
never
shall
be
,
any
more
.
<EOS>
If
you
would
have
me
ask
his
pardon
,
I
will
do
it
,
Mama
.
<EOS>
I
am
almost
sure
he
will
grant
it
now
,
if
I
ask
him
.
<EOS>
May
Heaven
grant
it
to
you
,
too
,
and
comfort
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
answered
not
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
Walter
---
I
am
married
to
him
,
and
we
have
a
son
,
"
said
Florence
,
timidly
---
<EOS>
"
is
at
the
door
,
and
has
brought
me
here
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
him
that
you
are
repentant
;
that
you
are
changed
,
"
said
Florence
,
looking
mournfully
upon
her
;
"
and
he
will
speak
to
Papa
with
me
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
but
this
that
I
can
do
?
"
   
<EOS>
Edith
,
breaking
her
silence
,
without
moving
eye
or
limb
,
answered
slowly
:

She

Florence
very
gently

drawing
nearer
to
her
,
"
I
have
not

back

<EOS>
Edith
,
as
if

fell
beneath
her
touch

sunk
down
on

caught
her

<EOS>
Upon

upon

up

swore
it

"
Florence

<EOS>
she
said
,
"
purest

work
some
change

am
innocent

that
;

once
more

me
lay
this

<EOS>
She
was
moved
and
weeping
.
<EOS>
Had
she
been
oftener
thus
in
older
days

she
had
been
happier
now

<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing

she
said
,

that
would
have
wrung
denial
from
me
.
<EOS>
No
love
,
no
hatred
,
no
hope

no

<EOS>
I
said
that
I
would
die
,
and
make
no
sign

<EOS>
I
could
have
done
so
,
and
I
would
,
if
we
had
never
met
,
Florence
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
trust
,
"
said
Cousin
Feenix
,
ambling
in
at
the
door
,
and
speaking
,
half
in
the
room
,
and
half
out
of
it
,
"
that
my
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
will
excuse
my
having
,
by
a
little
stratagem
,
effected
this
meeting
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
I
was
,
at
first
,
wholly
incredulous
as
to
the
possibility
of
my
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
having
,
very
unfortunately
,
committed
herself
with
the
deceased
person
with
white
teeth
;
because
,
in
point
of
fact
,
one
does
see
,
in
this
world
---
which
is
remarkable
for
devilish
strange
arrangements
,
and
for
being
decidedly
the
most
unintelligible
thing
within
a
man
's
experience
---
very
odd
conjunctions
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
mentioned
to
my
friend
Dombey
,
I
could
not
admit
the
criminality
of
my
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
until
it
was
perfectly
established
.
<EOS>
And
feeling
,
when
the
deceased
person
was
,
in
point
of
fact
,
destroyed
in
a
devilish
horrible
manner
,
that
her
position
was
a
very
painful
one
---
and
feeling
besides
that
our
family
had
been
a
little
to
blame
in
not
paying
more
attention
to
her
,
and
that
we
are
a
careless
family
---
and
also
that
my
aunt
,
though
a
devilish
lively
woman
,
had
perhaps
not
been
the
very
best
of
mothers
<EOS>
---
I
took
the
liberty
of
seeking
her
in
France
,
and
offering
her
such
protection
as
a
man
very
much
out
at
elbows
could
offer
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
occasion
,
my
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
did
me
the
honour
to
express
that
she
believed
I
was
,
in
my
way
,
a
devilish
good
sort
of
fellow
;
and
that
therefore
she
put
herself
under
my
protection
.
<EOS>
Which
in
point
of
fact
I
understood
to
be
a
kind
thing
on
the
part
of
my
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
,
as
I
am
getting
extremely
shaky
,
and
have
derived
great
comfort
from
her
solicitude
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
,
who
had
taken
Florence
to
a
sofa
,
made
a
gesture
with
her
hand
as
if
she
would
have
begged
him
to
say
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
,
"
resumed
Cousin
Feenix
,
still
ambling
about
at
the
door
,
"
will
excuse
me
,
if
,
for
her
satisfaction
,
and
my
own
,
and
that
of
my
friend
Dombey
,
whose
lovely
and
accomplished
daughter
we
so
much
admire
,
I
complete
the
thread
of
my
observations
.
<EOS>
She
will
remember
that
,
from
the
first
,
she
and
I
have
never
alluded
to
the
subject
of
her
elopement
.
<EOS>
My
impression
,
certainly
,
has
always
been
,
that
there
was
a
mystery
in
the
affair
which
she
could
explain
if
so
inclined
.
<EOS>
But
my
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
being
a
devilish
resolute
woman
,
I
knew
that
she
was
not
,
in
point
of
fact
,
to
be
trifled
with
,
and
therefore
did
not
involve
myself
in
any
discussions
,
But
observing
lately
,
that
her
accessible
point
did
appear
to
be
a
very
strong
description
of
tenderness
for
the
daughter
of
my
friend
Dombey
<EOS>
,
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
I
could
bring
about
a
meeting
,
unexpected
on
both
sides
,
it
might
lead
to
beneficial
results
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
we
being
in
London
,
in
the
present
private
way
,
before
going
to
the
South
of
Italy
,
there
to
establish
ourselves
,
in
point
of
fact
,
until
we
go
to
our
long
homes
,
which
is
a
devilish
disagreeable
reflection
for
a
man
,
I
applied
myself
to
the
discovery
of
the
residence
of
my
friend
Gay
---
handsome
man
of
an
uncommonly
frank
disposition
,
who
is
probably
known
to
my
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
---
and
had
the
happiness
of
bringing
his
amiable
wife
to
the
present
place
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
"
said
Cousin
Feenix
,
with
a
real
and
genuine
earnestness
shining
through
the
levity
of
his
manner
and
his
slipshod
speech
,
<EOS>
"
I
do
conjure
my
relative
,
not
to
stop
half
way
,
but
to
set
right
,
as
far
as
she
can
,
whatever
she
has
done
wrong
---
not
for
the
honour
of
her
family
,
not
for
her
own
fame
,
not
for
any
of
those
considerations
which
unfortunate
circumstances
have
induced
her
to
regard
as
hollow
,
and
in
point
of
fact
,
as
approaching
to
humbug
---
but
because
it
is
wrong
,
and
not
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Cousin
Feenix
's
legs
consented
to
take
him
away
after
this
;
and
leaving
them
alone
together
,
he
shut
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
Edith
remained
silent
for
some
minutes
,
with
Florence
sitting
close
beside
her
.
<EOS>
Then
she
took
from
her
bosom
a
sealed
paper
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
debated
with
myself
a
long
time
,
"
she
said
in
a
low
voice
,
"
whether
to
write
this
at
all
,
in
case
of
dying
suddenly
or
by
accident
,
and
feeling
the
want
of
it
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
deliberated
,
ever
since
,
when
and
how
to
destroy
it
.
<EOS>
Take
it
,
Florence
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
written
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
for
Papa
?
"
asked
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
for
whom
you
will
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
given
to
you
,
and
is
obtained
by
you
.
<EOS>
He
never
could
have
had
it
otherwise
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
they
sat
silent
,
in
the
deepening
darkness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mama
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
he
has
lost
his
fortune
;
he
has
been
at
the
point
of
death
;
he
may
not
recover
,
even
now
.
<EOS>
Is
there
any
word
that
I
shall
say
to
him
from
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
tell
me
,
"
asked
Edith
,
"
that
you
were
very
dear
to
him
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
"
said
Florence
,
in
a
thrilling
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
I
am
sorry
that
we
ever
met
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
more
?
"
said
Florence
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
,
if
he
asks
,
that
I
do
not
repent
of
what
I
have
done
---
not
yet
---
for
if
it
were
to
do
again
to
-
morrow
,
I
should
do
it
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
is
a
changed
man
---
"
  
She
stopped
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
the
silent
touch
of
Florence
's
hand
that
stopped
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
---
But
that
being
a
changed
man
,
he
knows
,
now
,
it
would
never
be
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
I
wish
it
never
had
been
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
say
,
"
said
Florence
,
"
that
you
grieved
to
hear
of
the
afflictions
he
has
suffered
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
,
"
she
replied
,
"
if
they
have
taught
him
that
his
daughter
is
very
dear
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
will
not
grieve
for
them
himself
,
one
day
,
if
they
have
brought
that
lesson
,
Florence
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wish
well
to
him
,
and
would
have
him
happy
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
would
!
"
said
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
let
me
be
able
,
if
I
have
the
occasion
at
some
future
time
,
to
say
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
sat
with
her
dark
eyes
gazing
steadfastly
before
her
,
and
did
not
reply
until
Florence
had
repeated
her
entreaty
;
when
she
drew
her
hand
within
her
arm
,
and
said
,
with
the
same
thoughtful
gaze
upon
the
night
outside
:
  
"
Tell
him
that
if
,
in
his
own
present
,
he
can
find
any
reason
to
compassionate
my
past
,
I
sent
word
that
I
asked
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
that
if
,
in
his
own
present
,
he
can
find
a
reason
to
think
less
bitterly
of
me
,
I
asked
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
,
that
,
dead
as
we
are
to
one
another
,
never
more
to
meet
on
this
side
of
eternity
,
he
knows
there
is
one
feeling
in
common
between
us
now
,
that
there
never
was
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
sternness
seemed
to
yield
,
and
there
were
tears
in
her
dark
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
trust
myself
to
that
,
"
she
said
,
"
for
his
better
thoughts
of
me
,
and
mine
of
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
loves
his
Florence
most
,
he
will
hate
me
least
.
<EOS>
When
he
is
most
proud
and
happy
in
her
and
her
children
,
he
will
be
most
repentant
of
his
own
part
in
the
dark
vision
of
our
married
life
.
<EOS>
At
that
time
,
I
will
be
repentant
too
---
let
him
know
it
then
---
and
think
that
when
I
thought
so
much
of
all
the
causes
that
had
made
me
what
I
was
,
I
needed
to
have
allowed
more
for
the
causes
that
had
made
him
what
he
was
.
<EOS>
I
will
try
,
then
,
to
forgive
him
his
share
of
blame
.
<EOS>
Let
him
try
to
forgive
me
mine
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
Mama
!
"
said
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
How
it
lightens
my
heart
,
even
in
such
a
meeting
and
parting
,
to
hear
this
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Strange
words
in
my
own
ears
,
"
said
Edith
,
"
and
foreign
to
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
!
<EOS>
But
even
if
I
had
been
the
wretched
creature
I
have
given
him
occasion
to
believe
me
,
I
think
I
could
have
said
them
still
,
hearing
that
you
and
he
were
very
dear
to
one
another
.
<EOS>
Let
him
,
when
you
are
dearest
,
ever
feel
that
he
is
most
forbearing
in
his
thoughts
of
me
---
that
I
am
most
forbearing
in
my
thoughts
of
him
!
<EOS>
Those
are
the
last
words
I
send
him
!
<EOS>
Now
,
good
-
bye
,
my
life
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
clasped
her
in
her
arms
,
and
seemed
to
pour
out
all
her
woman
's
soul
of
love
and
tenderness
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
kiss
for
your
child
!
<EOS>
These
kisses
for
a
blessing
on
your
head
!
<EOS>
My
own
dear
Florence
,
my
sweet
girl
,
farewell
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
meet
again
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
again
!
<EOS>
Never
again
!
<EOS>
When
you
leave
me
in
this
dark
room
,
think
that
you
have
left
me
in
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Remember
only
that
I
was
once
,
and
that
I
loved
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
Florence
left
her
,
seeing
her
face
no
more
,
but
accompanied
by
her
embraces
and
caresses
to
the
last
.
  
<EOS>
Cousin
Feenix
met
her
at
the
door
,
and
took
her
down
to
Walter
in
the
dingy
dining
-
room
:
upon
whose
shoulder
she
laid
her

"
I
am
devilish
sorry
,
"
said
Cousin
Feenix
,
lifting
his
wrist
-
bands
to
his
eyes
in
the
simplest
manner
possible
,
and
without
the
least
concealment
,
"
that
the
lovely
and
accomplished
daughter
of
my
friend
Dombey
and
amiable
wife
of
my
friend
Gay
,
should
have
had
her
sensitive
nature
so
very
much
distressed
and
cut
up
by
the
interview
which
is
just
concluded
.
<EOS>
But
I
hope
and
trust
<EOS>
I
have
acted
for
the
best
,
and
that
my
honourable
friend
Dombey
will
find
his
mind
relieved
by
the
disclosures
which
have
taken
place
.
<EOS>
I
exceedingly
lament
that
my
friend
Dombey
should
have
got
himself
,
in
point
of
fact
,
into
the
devil
's
own
state
of
conglomeration
by
an
alliance
with
our
family
;
but
am
strongly
of
opinion
that
if
it
had
n't
been
for
the
infernal
scoundrel
Barker
---
man
with
white
teeth
---
everything
would
have
gone
on
pretty
smoothly
.
<EOS>
In
regard
to
my
relative
who
does
me
the
honour
to
have
formed
an
uncommonly
good
opinion
of
myself
,
I
can
assure
the
amiable
wife
of
my
friend
Gay
,
that
she
may
rely
on
my
being
,
in
point
of
fact
,
a
father
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
in
regard
to
the
changes
of
human
life
,
and
the
extraordinary
manner
in
which
we
are
perpetually
conducting
ourselves
,
all
I
can
say
is
,
with
my
friend
Shakespeare
---
man
who
was
n't
for
an
age
but
for
all
time
,
and
with
whom
my
friend
Gay
is
no
doubt
acquainted
---
that
it
's
like
the
shadow
of
a
dream
.

A
BOTTLE
that
has
been
long
excluded
from
the
light
of
day
,
and
is
hoary
with
dust
and
cobwebs
,
has
been
brought
into
the
sunshine
;
and
the
golden
wine
within
it
sheds
a
lustre
on
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
the
last
bottle
of
the
old
Madeira
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
right
,
Mr
Gills
,
"
says
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
very
rare
and
most
delicious
wine
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
,
who
is
of
the
party
,
beams
with
joy
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
very
halo
of
delight
round
his
glowing
forehead
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
always
promised
ourselves
,
Sir
,
"
observes
Mr
Gills
,
"
Ned
and
myself
,
<EOS>
I
mean
---
"
  
Mr
Dombey
nods
at
the
Captain
,
who
shines
more
and
more
with
speechless
gratification
.
  
"
---
that
we
would
drink
this
,
one
day
or
other
,
to
Walter
safe
at
home
:
though
such
a
home
we
never
thought
of
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
object
to
our
old
whim
,
Sir
,
let
us
devote
this
first
glass
to
Walter
and
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
Walter
and
his
wife
!
"
says
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Florence
,
my
child
"
---
and
turns
to
kiss
her
.
  
"
To
Walter
and
his
wife
!
"
says
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
Wal'r
and
his
wife
!
"
exclaims
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
Hooroar
!
"
and
the
Captain
exhibiting
a
strong
desire
to
clink
his
glass
against
some
other
glass
,
Mr
Dombey
,
with
a
ready
hand
,
holds
out
his
.
<EOS>
The
others
follow
;
and
there
is
a
blithe
and
merry
ringing
,
as
of
a
little
peal
of
marriage
bells
.
  
<EOS>
Other
buried
wine
grows
older
,
as
the
old
Madeira
did
in
its
time
;
and
dust
and
cobwebs
thicken
on
the
bottles
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
is
a
white
-
haired
gentleman
,
whose
face
bears
heavy
marks
of
care
and
suffering
;
but
they
are
traces
of
a
storm
that
has
passed
on
for
ever
,
and
left
a
clear
evening
in
its
track
.
  
<EOS>
Ambitious
projects
trouble
him
no
more
.
<EOS>
His
only
pride
is
in
his
daughter
and
her
husband
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
silent
,
thoughtful
,
quiet
manner
,
and
is
always
with
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
is
not
unfrequently
of
the
family
party
,
and
is
quite
devoted
to
it
,
and
a
great
favourite
.
<EOS>
Her
admiration
of
her
once
stately
patron
is
,
and
has
been
ever
since
the
morning
of
her
shock
in
Princess
's
Place
,
platonic
,
but
not
weakened
in
the
least
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
has
drifted
to
him
from
the
wreck
of
his
fortunes
,
but
a
certain
annual
sum
that
comes
he
knows
not
how
,
with
an
earnest
entreaty
that
he
will
not
seek
to
discover
,
and
with
the
assurance
that
it
is
a
debt
,
and
an
act
of
reparation
.
<EOS>
He
has
consulted
with
his
old
clerk
about
this
,
who
is
clear
it
may
be
honourably
accepted
,
and
has
no
doubt
it
arises
out
of
some
forgotten
transaction
in
the
times
of
the
old
House
.
  
<EOS>
That
hazel
-
eyed
bachelor
,
a
bachelor
no
more
,
is
married
now
,
and
to
the
sister
of
the
grey
-
haired
Junior
.
<EOS>
He
visits
his
old
chief
sometimes
,
but
seldom
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
reason
in
the
grey
-
haired
Junior
's
history
,
and
yet
a
stronger
reason
in
his
name
,
why
he
should
keep
retired
from
his
old
employer
;
and
as
he
lives
with
his
sister
and
her
husband
,
they
participate
in
that
retirement
.
<EOS>
Walter
sees
them
sometimes
---
Florence
too
---
and
the
pleasant
house
resounds
with
profound
duets
arranged
for
the
Piano
-
Forte
and
Violoncello
,
and
with
the
labours
of
Harmonious
Blacksmiths
.
  
<EOS>
And
how
goes
the
Wooden
Midshipman
in
these
changed
days
?
<EOS>
Why
,
here
he
still
is
,
right
leg
foremost
,
hard
at
work
upon
the
hackney
coaches
,
and
more
on
the
alert
than
ever
,
being
newly
painted
from
his
cocked
hat
to
his
buckled
shoes
;
and
up
above
him
,
in
golden
characters
,
these
names
shine
refulgent
,
GILLS
AND
CUTTLE
.
  
<EOS>
Not
another
stroke
of
business
does
the
Midshipman
achieve
beyond
his
usual
easy
trade
.
<EOS>
But
they
do
say
,
in
a
circuit
of
some
half
-
mile
round
the
blue
umbrella
in
Leadenhall
Market
,
that
some
of
Mr
Gills
's
old
investments
are
coming
out
wonderfully
well
;
and
that
instead
of
being
behind
the
time
in
those
respects
,
as
he
supposed
,
he
was
,
in
truth
,
a
little
before
it
,
and
had
to
wait
the
fulness
of
the
time
and
the
design
.
<EOS>
The
whisper
is
that
Mr
Gills
's
money
has
begun
to
turn
itself
,
and
that
it
is
turning
itself
over
and
over
pretty
briskly
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
is
that
,
standing
at
his
shop
-
door
,
in
his
coffee
-
coloured
suit
,
with
his
chronometer
in
his
pocket
,
and
his
spectacles
on
his
forehead
,
he
do
n't
appear
to
break
his
heart
at
customers
not
coming
,
but
looks
very
jovial
and
contented
,
though
full
as
misty
as
of
yore
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
his
partner
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
there
is
a
fiction
of
a
business
in
the
Captain
's
mind
which
is
better
than
any
reality
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
is
as
satisfied
of
the
Midshipman
's
importance
to
the
commerce
and
navigation
of
the
country
,
as
he
could
possibly
be
,
if
no
ship
left
the
Port
of
London
without
the
Midshipman
's
assistance
.
<EOS>
His
delight
in
his
own
name
over
the
door
,
is
inexhaustible
.
<EOS>
He
crosses
the
street
,
twenty
times
a
day
,
to
look
at
it
from
the
other
side
of
the
way
;
and
invariably
says
,
on
these
occasions
,
"
Ed'ard
<EOS>
Cuttle
,
my
lad
,
if
your
mother
could
ha
<EOS>
"
know'd
as
you
would
ever
be
a
man
o
'
science
,
the
good
old
creetur
would
ha
"
been
took
aback
in
-
deed
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
here
is
Mr
Toots
descending
on
the
Midshipman
with
violent
rapidity
,
and
Mr
Toots
's
face
is
very
red
as
he
bursts
into
the
little
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Gills
,
"
says
Mr
Toots
,
"
and
Mr
Sols
,
I
am
happy
to
inform
you
that
Mrs
Toots
has
had
an
increase
to
her
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
does
her
credit
!
"
<EOS>
cries
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
give
you
joy
,
Mr
Toots
!
"
says
old
Sol
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
"
chuckles
Mr
Toots
,
"
I
'm
very
much
obliged
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
you
'd
be
glad
to
hear
,
and
so
I
came
down
myself
.
<EOS>
We
're
positively
getting
on
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
There
's
Florence
,
and
Susan
,
and
now
here
's
another
little
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
female
stranger
?
<EOS>
"
inquires
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
says
Mr
Toots
,
"
and
I
'm
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
oftener
we
can
repeat
that
most
extraordinary
woman
,
my
opinion
is
,
the
better
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stand
by
!
"
says
the
Captain
,
turning
to
the
old
case
-
bottle
with
no
throat
<EOS>
---
for
it
is
evening
,
and
the
Midshipman
's
usual
moderate
provision
of
pipes
and
glasses
is
on
the
board
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
's
to
her
,
and
may
she
have
ever
so
many
more
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
says
the
delighted
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
I
echo
the
sentiment
.
<EOS>
If
you
'll
allow
me
,
as
my
so
doing
can
not
be
unpleasant
to
anybody
,
under
the
circumstances
,
I
think
I
'll
take
a
pipe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
begins
to
smoke
,
accordingly
,
and
in
the
openness
of
his
heart
is
very
loquacious
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
all
the
remarkable
instances
that
that
delightful
woman
has
given
of
her
excellent
sense
,
Captain
Gills
and
Mr
Sols
,
"
said
Toots
,
"
I
think
none
is
more
remarkable
than
the
perfection
with
which
she
has
understood
my
devotion
to
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Both
his
auditors
assent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
you
know
,
"
says
Mr
Toots
,
"
I
have
never
changed
my
sentiments
towards
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
They
are
the
same
as
ever
.
<EOS>
She
is
the
same
bright
vision
to
me
,
at
present
,
that
she
was
before
I
made
Walters
's
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
When
Mrs
Toots
and
myself
first
began
to
talk
of
---
in
short
,
of
the
tender
passion
,
you
know
,
Captain
Gills
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
my
lad
<EOS>
,
"
says
the
Captain
,
"
as
makes
us
all
slue
round
---
for
which
you
'll
overhaul
the
book
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
certainly
do
so
,
Captain
Gills
,
"
says
Mr
Toots
,
with
great
earnestness
;
"
when
we
first
began
to
mention
such
subjects
,
I
explained
that
I
was
what
you
may
call
a
Blighted
Flower
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Captain
approves
of
this
figure
greatly
;
and
murmurs
that
no
flower
as
blows
,
is
like
the
rose
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
Lord
bless
me
,
"
pursues
Mr
Toots
,
"
she
was
as
entirely
conscious
of
the
state
of
my
feelings
as
I
was
myself
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
I
could
tell
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
only
person
who
could
have
stood
between
me
and
the
silent
Tomb
,
and
she
did
it
,
in
a
manner
to
command
my
everlasting
admiration
.
<EOS>
She
knows
that
there
's
nobody
in
the
world
I
look
up
to
,
as
I
do
to
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
She
knows
that
there
's
nothing
on
earth
<EOS>
I
would
n't
do
for
Miss
Dombey
.
<EOS>
She
knows
that
I
consider
Miss
Dombey
the
most
beautiful
,
the
most
amiable
,
the
most
angelic
of
her
sex
.
<EOS>
What
is
her
observation
upon
that
?
<EOS>
The
perfection
of
sense
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
're
right
.
<EOS>
I
think
so
too
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
so
do
I
!
"
says
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
do
I
,
"
says
Sol
Gills
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
resumes
Mr
Toots
,
after
some
contemplative
pulling
at
his
pipe
,
during
which
his
visage
has
expressed
the
most
contented
reflection
,
"
what
an
observant
woman
my
wife
is!What
sagacity
she
possesses
!
<EOS>
What
remarks
she
makes
!
<EOS>
It
was
only
last
night
,
when
wewere
sitting
in
the
enjoyment
of
connubial
bliss
---
which
,
upon
my
word
and
honour
,
is
a
feeble
term
to
express
my
feelings
in
the
society
of
my
wife
---
that
she
said
how
remarkable
it
was
to
consider
the
present
position
of
our
friend
Walters
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
"
observes
my
wife
,
"
he
is
,
released
from
sea
-
going
,
after
that
first
long
voyage
with
his
young
bride

as
you
know
he
was
,
Mr
Sols
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
true

says
the
old
Instrument

maker
,
rubbing
his
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Here
he
is
,

say
my
wife
,
"
released
from
that
,
immediately
;
appointed
by
the
same
establishment
to
a
post
of
great
trust
and
confidence
at
home
;
showing
himself
again
worthy

mounting
up
the
ladder
with
the
greatest
expedition

beloved
by
everybody
;
assisted
by
this
uncle
at
the
very
best
possible
time
of
his
fortunes
"
---
which
I
think
is
the
case
,
Mr
Sols
?
<EOS>
My
wife
is
always
correct
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
yes
,
yes
---
some
of
our
lost
ships
,
freighted
with
gold

have
come

truly

returns
old
Sol
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Small
craft
,
Mr
Toots
,
but
serviceable
to
my
boy
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
so
,
"
says
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
never
find
my
wife
wrong

<EOS>

Here
he
is

says
that
most
remarkable
woman
,
"
so
situated

and
what
follows
?
<EOS>
What
follows

<EOS>
"
observed
Mrs
Toots
.
<EOS>
Now
pray
remark
,
Captain
Gills
,
and
Mr
Sols
,
the
depth
of
my
wife
's
penetration
.
<EOS>
"
Why
that
,
under
the
very
eye
of
Mr
Dombey

there
is
a
foundation
going
on

a

's
word
,
"
says
Mr
Toots
exultingly
,
"
"
is
gradually
rising
,
perhaps
to
equal
,
perhaps
excel
,
that
of
which
he
was
once
the
head
,
and
the
small
beginnings
of
which
(
a
common
fault
,
but
a
bad
one
<EOS>
,
Mrs
Toots
said
)
escaped
his
memory
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
"
said
my
wife
,
"
from
his
daughter
,
after
all
,
another
Dombey
and
Son
will
ascend
"
---
no
"
rise
;
"
that
was
Mrs
Toots
's
word
---
"
triumphant
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
with
the
assistance
of
his
pipe
---
which
he
is
extremely
glad
to
devote
to
oratorical
purposes
,
as
its
proper
use
affects
him
with
a
very
uncomfortable
sensation
---
does
such
grand
justice
to
this
prophetic
sentence
of
his
wife
's
,
that
the
Captain
,
throwing
away
his
glazed
hat
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
excitement
,
cries
:
  
"
<EOS>
Sol
Gills
,
you
man
of
science
and
my
ould
pardner
,
what
did
I
tell
Wal'r
to
overhaul
on
that
there
night
when
he
first
took
to
business
?
<EOS>
Was
it
<EOS>
this
here
quotation
,
"
Turn
again
Whittington
,
Lord
Mayor
of
London
,
and
when
you
are
old
<EOS>
you
will
never
depart
from
it
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Was
it
them
words
,
Sol
Gills
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
certainly
was
,
Ned
,
"
replied
the
old
Instrument
-
maker
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
tell
you
what
,
"
says
the
Captain
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
and
composing
his
chest
for
a
prodigious
roar
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
give
you
Lovely
Peg
right
through
;
and
stand
by
,
both
on
you
,
for
the
chorus
!
"
  
<EOS>
Buried
wine
grows
older
,
as
the
old
Madeira
did
,
in
its
time
;
and
dust
and
cobwebs
thicken
on
the
bottles
.
  
<EOS>
Autumn
days
are
shining
,
and
on
the
sea
-
beach
there
are
often
a
young
lady
,
and
a
white
-
haired
gentleman
.
<EOS>
With
them
,
or
near
them
,
are
two
children
:
boy
and
girl
.
<EOS>
And
an
old
dog
is
generally
in
their
company
.
  
<EOS>
The
white
-
haired
gentleman
walks
with
the
little
boy
,
talks
with
him
,
helps
him
in
his
play
,
attends
upon
him
,
watches
him
,
as
if
he
were
the
object
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
If
he
be
thoughtful
,
the
white
-
haired
gentleman
is
thoughtful
too
;
and
sometimes
when
the
child
is
sitting
by
his
side
,
and
looks
up
in
his
face
,
asking
him
questions
,
he
takes
the
tiny
hand
in
his
,
and
holding
it
,
forgets
to
answer
.
<EOS>
Then
the
child
says
:
  
"
<EOS>
What
,
grandpapa
!
<EOS>
Am
I
so
like
my
poor
little
uncle
again
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Paul
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
weak
,
and
you
are
very
strong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
I
am
very
strong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
lay
on
a
little
bed
beside
the
sea
,
and
you
can
run
about
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
they
range
away
again
,
busily
,
for
the
white
-
haired
gentleman
likes
best
to
see
the
child
free
and
stirring
;
and
as
they
go
about
together
,
the
story
of
the
bond
between
them
goes
about
,
and
follows
them
.
  
<EOS>
But
no
one
,
except
Florence
,
knows
the
measure
of
the
white
-
haired
gentleman
's
affection
for
the
girl
.
<EOS>
That
story
never
goes
about
.
<EOS>
The
child
herself
almost
wonders
at
a
certain
secrecy
he
keeps
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
hoards
her
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
bear
to
see
a
cloud
upon
her
face
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
bear
to
see
her
sit
apart
.
<EOS>
He
fancies
that
she
feels
a
slight
,
when
there
is
none
.
<EOS>
He
steals
away
to
look
at
her
,
in
her
sleep
.
<EOS>
It
pleases
him
to
have
her
come
,
and
wake
him
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
He
is
fondest
of
her
and
most
loving
to
her
,
when
there
is
no
creature
by
.
<EOS>
The
child
says
then
,
sometimes
:
  
"
Dear
grandpapa
,
why
do
you
cry
when
you
kiss
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
only
answers
,
"
Little
Florence
!
<EOS>
Little
Florence
!
"
<EOS>
and
smooths
away
the
curls
that
shade
her
earnest
eyes
.
