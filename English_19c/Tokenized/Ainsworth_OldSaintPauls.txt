Title
:
<EOS>
Old
Saint
Paul
's
       
A
Tale
of
the
Plague
and
the
Fire
Author
:
<EOS>
William
Harrison
Ainsworth
    
<EOS>
The
portion
of
the
ensuing
Tale
relating
to
the
Grocer
of
Wood
-
street
,
and
his
manner
of
victualling
his
house
,
and
shutting
up
himself
and
his
family
within
it
during
the
worst
part
of
the
Plague
of
1665
,
is
founded
on
a
narrative
,
which
I
have
followed
pretty
closely
in
most
of
its
details
,
contained
in
a
very
rare
little
volume
,
entitled
,
"
_
Preparations
against
the
Plague
,
both
of
Soul
and
Body
_
,
"
the
authorship
of
which
I
have
no
hesitation
in
assigning
to
DEFOE
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
venture
to
pronounce
it
his
masterpiece
.
<EOS>
It
is
strange
that
this
matchless
performance
should
have
hitherto
escaped
attention
,
and
that
it
should
not
have
been
reprinted
with
some
one
of
the
countless
impressions
of
the
"
_
History
of
the
Plague
of
London
_
,
"
to
which
it
forms
an
almost
necessary
accompaniment
.
<EOS>
The
omission
,
I
trust
,
will
be
repaired
by
Mr.
HAZLITT
the
younger
,
DEFOE
'S
last
and
best
editor
,
in
his
valuable
edition
of
the
works
of
that
great
novelist
and
political
writer
,
now
in
the
course
of
publication
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
added
,
that
a
case
precisely
similar
to
that
of
the
Grocer
,
and
attended
with
the
same
happy
results
,
occurred
during
the
Plague
of
Marseilles
,
in
1720
.
 
<EOS>
For
my
acquaintance
with
this
narrative
,
as
well
as
for
the
suggestion
of
its
application
to
the
present
purpose
,
I
am
indebted
to
my
friend
,
Mr.
JAMES
CROSSLEY
,
of
Manchester

THE
GROCER
OF
WOOD
-
STREET
AND
HIS
FAMILY
.
 
<EOS>
One
night
,
at
the
latter
end
of
April
,
1665
,
the
family
of
a
citizen
of
London
carrying
on
an
extensive
business
as
a
grocer
in
Wood
-
street
,
Cheapside
,
were
assembled
,
according
to
custom
,
at
prayer
.
<EOS>
The
grocer
's
name
was
Stephen
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
His
family
consisted
of
his
wife
,
three
sons
,
and
two
daughters
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
moreover
,
an
apprentice
;
an
elderly
female
serving
as
cook
;
her
son
,
a
young
man
about
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
filling
the
place
of
porter
to
the
shop
and
general
assistant
;
and
a
kitchen
-
maid
.
<EOS>
The
whole
household
attended
;
for
the
worthy
grocer
,
being
a
strict
observer
of
his
religious
duties
,
as
well
as
a
rigid
disciplinarian
in
other
respects
,
suffered
no
one
to
be
absent
,
on
any
plea
<EOS>
whatever
,
except
indisposition
,
from
morning
and
evening
devotions
;
and
these
were
always
performed
at
stated
times
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
establishment
was
conducted
with
the
regularity
of
clockwork
,
it
being
the
aim
of
its
master
not
to
pass
a
single
hour
of
the
day
unprofitably
.
 
<EOS>
The
ordinary
prayers
gone
through
,
Stephen
Bloundel
offered
up
along
and
fervent
supplication
to
the
Most
High
for
protection
against
the
devouring
pestilence
with
which
the
city
was
then
scourged
.
<EOS>
He
acknowledged
that
this
terrible
visitation
had
been
justly
brought
upon
it
by
the
wickedness
of
its
inhabitants
;
that
they
deserved
their
doom
,
dreadful
though
it
was
;
that
,
like
the
dwellers
in
Jerusalem
before
it
was
given
up
to
ruin
and
desolation
,
they
"
had
mocked
the
messengers
of
God
and
despised
His
word
;
"
that
in
the
language
of
the
prophet
,
"
they
had
refused
to
hearken
,
and
pulled
away
the
shoulder
,
and
stopped
their
ears
that
they
should
not
hear
;
yea
,
had
made
their
heart
like
an
adamant
stone
,
lest
they
should
hear
the
law
and
the
words
which
the
Lord
of
Hosts
had
sent
in
his
spirit
by
the
former
prophets
.
"
<EOS>
He
admitted
that
great
sins
require
great
chastisement
,
and
that
the
sins
of
London
were
enormous
;
that
it
was
filled
with
strifes
,
seditions
,
heresies
,
murders
,
drunkenness
,
revellings
,
and
every
kind
of
abomination
;
that
the
ordinances
of
God
were
neglected
,
and
all
manner
of
vice
openly
practised
;
that
,
despite
repeated
warnings
and
afflictions
less
grievous
than
the
present
,
these
vicious
practices
had
been
persisted
in
.
<EOS>
All
this
he
humbly
acknowledged
.
<EOS>
But
he
implored
a
gracious
Providence
,
in
consideration
of
his
few
faithful
servants
,
to
spare
the
others
yet
a
little
longer
,
and
give
them
a
last
chance
of
repentance
and
amendment
;
or
,
if
this
could
not
be
,
and
their
utter
extirpation
was
inevitable
,
that
the
habitations
of
the
devout
might
be
exempted
from
the
general
destruction
--
might
be
places
of
refuge
,
as
Zoar
was
to
Lot
.
<EOS>
He
concluded
by
earnestly
exhorting
those
around
him
to
keep
constant
watch
upon
themselves
;
not
to
murmur
at
God
's
dealings
and
dispensations
;
but
so
to
comport
themselves
,
that
"
they
might
be
able
to
stand
in
the
day
of
wrath
,
in
the
day
of
death
,
and
in
the
day
of
judgment
.
"
<EOS>
The
exhortation
produced
a
powerful
effect
upon
its
hearers
,
and
they
arose
,
some
with
serious
,
others
with
terrified
looks
.
 
<EOS>
Before
proceeding
further
,
it
may
be
desirable
to
show
in
what
manner
the
dreadful
pestilence
referred
to
by
the
grocer
commenced
,
and
how
far
its
ravages
had
already
extended
.
<EOS>
Two
years
before
,
namely
,
in
1663
,
more
than
a
third
of
the
population
of
Amsterdam
was
carried
off
by
a
desolating
plague
.
<EOS>
Hamburgh
was
also
grievously
afflicted
about
the
same
time
,
and
in
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
every
effort
to
cut
off
communication
with
these
states
,
the
insidious
disease
found
its
way
into
England
by
means
of
some
bales
of
merchandise
,
as
it
was
suspected
,
at
the
latter
end
of
the
year
1664
,
when
two
persons
died
suddenly
,
with
undoubted
symptoms
of
the
distemper
,
in
Westminster
.
<EOS>
Its
next
appearance
was
at
a
house
in
Long
Acre
,
and
its
victims
two
Frenchmen
,
who
had
brought
goods
from
the
Levant
.
<EOS>
Smothered
for
a
short
time
,
like
a
fire
upon
which
coals
had
been
heaped
,
it
broke
out
with
fresh
fury
in
several
places
.
 
<EOS>
The
consternation
now
began
.
<EOS>
The
whole
city
was
panic
-
stricken
:
nothing
was
talked
of
but
the
plague
--
nothing
planned
but
means
of
arresting
its
progress
--
<EOS>
one
grim
and
ghastly
idea
possessed
the
minds
of
all
.
<EOS>
Like
a
hideous
phantom
stalking
the
streets
at
noon
-
day
,
and
scaring
all
in
its
path
,
Death
took
his
course
through
London
,
and
selected
his
prey
at
pleasure
.
<EOS>
The
alarm
was
further
increased
by
the
predictions
confidently
made
as
to
the
vast
numbers
who
would
be
swept
away
by
the
visitation
;
by
the
prognostications
of
astrologers
;
by
the
prophesyings
of
enthusiasts
;
by
the
denunciations
of
preachers
,
and
by
the
portents
and
prodigies
reported
to
have
occurred
.
<EOS>
During
the
long
and
frosty
winter
preceding
this
fatal
year
,
a
comet
appeared
in
the
heavens
,
the
sickly
colour
of
which
was
supposed
to
forebode
the
judgment
about
to
follow
.
<EOS>
Blazing
stars
and
other
meteors
,
of
a
lurid
hue
and
strange
and
preternatural
shape
,
were
likewise
seen
.
<EOS>
The
sun
was
said
to
have
set
in
streams
of
blood
,
and
the
moon
to
have
shown
without
reflecting
a
shadow
;
grisly
shapes
appeared
at
night
--
<EOS>
strange
clamours
and
groans
were
heard
in
the
air
--
<EOS>
hearses
,
coffins
,
and
heaps
of
unburied
dead
were
discovered
in
the
sky
,
and
great
cakes
and
clots
of
blood
were
found
in
the
Tower
moat
;
while
a
marvellous
double
tide
occurred
at
London
Bridge
.
<EOS>
All
these
prodigies
were
currently
reported
,
and
in
most
cases
believed
.
 
<EOS>
The
severe
frost
,
before
noticed
,
did
not
break
up
till
the
end
of
February
,
and
with
the
thaw
the
plague
frightfully
increased
in
violence
.
<EOS>
From
Drury
-
lane
it
spread
along
Holborn
,
eastward
as
far
as
Great
Turnstile
,
and
westward
to
Saint
Giles
's
Pound
,
and
so
along
the
Tyburn
-
road
.
<EOS>
Saint
Andrew
's
,
Holborn
,
was
next
infected
;
and
as
this
was
a
much
more
populous
parish
than
the
former
,
the
deaths
were
more
numerous
within
it
.
<EOS>
For
a
while
,
the
disease
was
checked
by
Fleet
Ditch
;
it
then
leaped
this
narrow
boundary
,
and
ascending
the
opposite
hill
,
carried
fearful
devastation
into
Saint
James
's
,
Clerkenwell
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
it
attacked
Saint
Bride
's
;
thinned
the
ranks
of
the
thievish
horde
haunting
Whitefriars
,
and
proceeding
in
a
westerly
course
,
decimated
Saint
Clement
Danes
.
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
the
city
had
escaped
.
<EOS>
The
destroyer
had
not
passed
Ludgate
or
Newgate
,
but
environed
the
walls
like
a
besieging
enemy
.
<EOS>
A
few
days
,
however
,
before
the
opening
of
this
history
,
fine
weather
having
commenced
,
the
horrible
disease
began
to
grow
more
rife
,
and
laughing
all
precautions
and
impediments
to
scorn
,
broke
out
in
the
very
heart
of
the
stronghold
--
namely
,
in
Bearbinder
-
lane
,
near
Stock
's
Market
,
where
nine
persons
died
.
 
<EOS>
At
a
season
so
awful
,
it
may
be
imagined
how
an
impressive
address
,
like
that
delivered
by
the
grocer
,
would
be
received
by
those
who
saw
in
the
pestilence
,
not
merely
an
overwhelming
scourge
from
which
few
could
escape
,
but
a
direct
manifestation
of
the
Divine
displeasure
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
said
.
<EOS>
Blaize
Shotterel
,
the
porter
,
and
old
Josyna
,
his
mother
,
together
with
Patience
,
the
other
woman
-
servant
,
betook
themselves
silently
,
and
with
troubled
countenances
,
to
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
Leonard
Holt
,
the
apprentice
,
lingered
for
a
moment
to
catch
a
glance
from
the
soft
blue
eyes
of
Amabel
,
the
grocer
's
eldest
daughter
(
for
even
the
plague
was
a
secondary
consideration
with
him
when
she
was
present
)
,
and
failing
in
the
attempt
,
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
,
which
was
luckily
laid
to
the
account
of
the
discourse
he
had
just
listened
to
by
his
sharp
-
sighted
master
,
and
proceeded
to
the
shop
,
where
he
busied
himself
in
arranging
matters
for
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
Having
just
completed
his
twenty
-
first
year
,
and
his
apprenticeship
being
within
a
few
months
of
its
expiration
,
Leonard
Holt
began
to
think
of
returning
to
his
native
town
of
Manchester
,
where
he
intended
to
settle
,
and
where
he
had
once
fondly
hoped
the
fair
Amabel
would
accompany
him
,
in
the
character
of
his
bride
.
<EOS>
Not
that
he
had
ever
ventured
to
declare
his
passion
,
nor
that
he
had
received
sufficient
encouragement
to
make
it
matter
of
certainty
that
if
he
did
so
declare
himself
,
he
should
be
accepted
;
but
being
both
"
proper
and
tall
,
"
and
having
tolerable
confidence
in
his
good
looks
,
he
had
made
himself
,
up
to
a
short
time
prior
to
his
introduction
to
the
reader
,
quite
easy
on
the
point
.
 
<EOS>
His
present
misgivings
were
occasioned
by
Amabel
's
altered
manner
towards
him
,
and
by
a
rival
who
,
he
had
reason
to
fear
,
had
completely
superseded
him
in
her
good
graces
.
<EOS>
Brought
up
together
from
an
early
age
,
the
grocer
's
daughter
and
the
young
apprentice
had
at
first
regarded
each
other
as
brother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
the
feeling
changed
;
Amabel
became
more
reserved
,
and
held
little
intercourse
with
Leonard
,
who
,
busied
with
his
own
concerns
,
thought
little
about
her
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
he
grew
towards
manhood
,
he
could
not
remain
insensible
to
her
extraordinary
beauty
--
for
extraordinary
it
was
,
and
such
as
to
attract
admiration
wherever
she
went
,
so
that
the
"
Grocer
's
Daughter
"
became
the
toast
among
the
ruffling
gallants
of
the
town
,
many
of
whom
sought
to
obtain
speech
with
her
.
<EOS>
Her
parents
,
however
,
were
far
too
careful
to
permit
any
such
approach
.
<EOS>
Amabel
's
stature
was
lofty
;
her
limbs
slight
,
but
exquisitely
symmetrical
;
her
features
small
,
and
cast
in
the
most
delicate
mould
;
her
eyes
of
the
softest
blue
;
and
her
hair
luxuriant
,
and
of
the
finest
texture
and
richest
brown
.
<EOS>
Her
other
beauties
must
be
left
to
the
imagination
;
but
it
ought
not
to
be
omitted
that
she
was
barely
eighteen
,
and
had
all
the
freshness
,
the
innocence
,
and
vivacity
of
that
most
charming
period
of
woman
's
existence
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
she
ravished
every
heart
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
,
in
an
age
when
love
-
making
was
more
general
even
than
now
,
that
she
was
beset
by
admirers
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
her
father
's
apprentice
became
desperately
enamoured
of
her
,
and
proportionately
jealous
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
brings
us
to
his
rival
.
<EOS>
On
the
10th
of
April
,
two
gallants
,
both
richly
attired
,
and
both
young
and
handsome
,
dismounted
before
the
grocer
's
door
,
and
,
leaving
their
steeds
to
the
care
of
their
attendants
,
entered
the
shop
.
<EOS>
They
made
sundry
purchases
of
conserves
,
figs
,
and
other
dried
fruit
,
chatted
familiarly
with
the
grocer
,
and
tarried
so
long
,
that
at
last
he
began
to
suspect
they
must
have
some
motive
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
,
however
,
they
disagreed
on
some
slight
matter
--
Bloundel
could
not
tell
what
,
nor
,
perhaps
,
could
the
disputants
,
even
if
their
quarrel
was
not
preconcerted
--
high
words
arose
,
and
in
another
moment
,
swords
were
drawn
,
and
furious
passes
exchanged
.
<EOS>
The
grocer
called
to
his
eldest
son
,
a
stout
youth
of
nineteen
,
and
to
Leonard
Holt
,
to
separate
them
.
<EOS>
The
apprentice
seized
his
cudgel
--
<EOS>
no
apprentice
in
those
days
was
without
one
--
and
rushed
towards
the
combatants
,
but
before
he
could
interfere
,
the
fray
was
ended
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
had
received
a
thrust
through
the
sword
arm
,
and
his
blade
dropping
,
his
antagonist
declared
himself
satisfied
,
and
with
a
grave
salute
walked
off
.
<EOS>
The
wounded
man
wrapped
a
lace
handkerchief
round
his
arm
,
but
immediately
afterwards
complained
of
great
faintness
.
<EOS>
Pitying
his
condition
,
and
suspecting
no
harm
,
the
grocer
led
him
into
an
inner
room
,
where
restoratives
were
offered
by
Mrs.
Bloundel
and
her
daughter
Amabel
,
both
of
whom
had
been
alarmed
by
the
noise
of
the
conflict
.
<EOS>
In
a
short
time
,
the
wounded
man
was
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
converse
with
his
assistants
,
especially
the
younger
one
;
and
the
grocer
having
returned
to
the
shop
,
his
discourse
became
so
very
animated
and
tender
,
that
Mrs.
Bloundel
deemed
it
prudent
to
give
her
daughter
a
hint
to
retire
.
<EOS>
Amabel
reluctantly
obeyed
,
for
the
young
stranger
was
so
handsome
,
so
richly
dressed
,
had
such
a
captivating
manner
,
and
so
distinguished
an
air
,
that
she
was
strongly
prepossessed
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
A
second
look
from
her
mother
,
however
,
caused
her
to
disappear
,
nor
did
she
return
.
<EOS>
After
waiting
with
suppressed
anxiety
for
some
time
,
the
young
gallant
departed
,
overwhelming
the
good
dame
with
his
thanks
,
and
entreating
permission
to
call
again
.
<EOS>
This
was
peremptorily
refused
,
but
,
notwithstanding
the
interdiction
,
he
came
on
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
The
grocer
chanced
to
be
out
at
the
time
,
and
the
gallant
,
who
had
probably
watched
him
go
forth
,
deriding
the
remonstrances
of
the
younger
Bloundel
and
Leonard
,
marched
straight
to
the
inner
room
,
where
he
found
the
dame
and
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
They
were
much
disconcerted
at
his
appearance
,
and
the
latter
instantly
rose
with
the
intention
of
retiring
,
but
the
gallant
caught
her
arm
and
detained
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
fly
me
,
Amabel
,
"
he
cried
,
in
an
impassioned
tone
,
"
but
suffer
me
to
declare
the
love
I
have
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
live
without
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Amabel
,
whose
neck
and
cheeks
were
crimsoned
with
blushes
,
cast
down
her
eyes
before
the
ardent
regards
of
the
gallant
,
and
endeavoured
to
withdraw
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
word
only
,
"
he
continued
,
"
and
I
release
you
.
<EOS>
Am
I
wholly
indifferent
to
you
!
<EOS>
Answer
me
--
yes
or
no
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
_
not
_
answer
him
,
Amabel
,
"
interposed
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
deceiving
you
.
<EOS>
He
loves
you
not
.
<EOS>
He
would
ruin
you
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
way
with
all
these
court
butterflies
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
you
hate
him
,
child
,
and
bid
him
begone
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
can
not
tell
him
an
untruth
,
mother
,
"
returned
Amabel
,
artlessly
,
"
for
I
do
_
not
_
hate
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
love
me
,
"
cried
the
young
man
,
falling
on
his
knees
,
and
pressing
her
hand
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
so
,
and
make
me
the
happiest
of
men
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
Amabel
had
now
recovered
from
the
confusion
into
which
she
had
been
thrown
,
and
,
alarmed
at
her
own
indiscretion
,
forcibly
withdrew
her
hand
,
exclaiming
in
a
cold
tone
,
and
with
much
natural
dignity
,
"
Arise
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
tolerate
these
freedoms
.
<EOS>
My
mother
is
right
--
you
have
some
ill
design
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
my
soul
,
no
!
"
cried
the
gallant
,
passionately
.
<EOS>
"
I
love
you
,
and
would
make
you
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
"
remarked
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
contemptuously
,
"
but
not
by
marriage
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
by
marriage
,
"
rejoined
the
gallant
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"
If
she
will
consent
,
I
will
we
d
her
forthwith
.
"
 
<EOS>
Both
Amabel
and
her
mother
looked
surprised
at
the
young
man
's
declaration
,
which
was
uttered
with
a
fervour
that
seemed
to
leave
no
doubt
of
its
sincerity
;
but
the
latter
,
fearing
some
artifice
,
replied
,
"
If
what
you
say
is
true
,
and
you
really
love
my
daughter
as
much
as
you
pretend
,
this
is
not
the
way
to
win
her
;
for
though
she
can
have
no
pretension
to
we
d
with
one
of
your
seeming
degree
,
nor
is
it
for
her
happiness
that
she
should
,
yet
,
were
she
sought
by
the
proudest
noble
in
the
land
,
she
shall
never
,
if
I
can
help
it
,
be
lightly
won
.
<EOS>
If
your
intentions
are
honourable
,
you
must
address
yourself
,
in
the
first
place
,
to
her
father
,
and
if
he
agrees
(
which
I
much
doubt
)
that
you
shall
become
her
suitor
,
I
can
make
no
objection
.
<EOS>
Till
this
is
settled
,
I
must
pray
you
to
desist
from
further
importunity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
must
I
,
"
added
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
give
you
a
hope
till
you
have
spoken
to
my
father
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
it
so
,
"
replied
the
gallant
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tarry
here
till
his
return
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
was
about
to
seat
himself
,
but
Mrs.
Bloundel
prevented
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
permit
this
,
sir
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
tarrying
here
may
,
for
aught
I
know
,
bring
scandal
upon
my
house;--I
am
sure
it
will
be
disagreeable
to
my
husband
.
<EOS>
I
am
unacquainted
with
your
name
and
condition
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
a
man
of
rank
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
one
of
the
profligate
and
profane
crew
who
haunt
the
court
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
the
worst
of
them
all
,
my
Lord
Rochester
himself
.
<EOS>
He
is
about
your
age
,
I
have
heard
,
and
though
a
mere
boy
in
years
,
is
a
veteran
in
libertinism
.
<EOS>
But
,
whoever
you
are
,
and
whatever
your
rank
and
station
may
be
,
unless
your
character
will
bear
the
strictest
scrutiny
,
I
am
certain
Stephen
Bloundel
will
never
consent
to
your
union
with
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
mother
,
"
observed
Amabel
,
"
<EOS>
you
judge
the
gentleman
unjustly
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
he
is
neither
a
profligate
gallant
himself
,
nor
a
companion
of
such
--
especially
of
the
wicked
Earl
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
pretend
to
be
no
better
than
I
am
,
"
replied
the
young
man
,
repressing
a
smile
that
rose
to
his
lips
at
Mrs.
Bloundel
's
address
;
"
but
I
shall
reform
when
I
am
married
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
impossible
to
be
inconstant
to
so
fair
a
creature
as
Amabel
.
<EOS>
For
my
rank
,
I
have
none
.
<EOS>
My
condition
is
that
of
a
private
gentleman,--my
name
,
Maurice
Wyvil
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
you
say
of
yourself
,
Mr.
Maurice
Wyvil
,
convinces
me
you
will
meet
with
a
decided
refusal
from
my
husband
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
not
,
"
replied
Wyvil
,
glancing
tenderly
at
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
should
be
so
fortunate
as
to
gain
_
<EOS>
his
_
consent
,
have
I
_
yours
_
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
soon
to
ask
that
question
,
"
she
rejoined
,
blushing
deeply
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
sir
,
you
must
go
,
indeed
,
you
must
.
<EOS>
You
distress
my
mother
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
do
not
distress
<EOS>
_
you
_
<EOS>
,
I
will
stay
,
"
resumed
Wyvil
,
with
an
imploring
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
_
do
_
distress
me
,
"
she
answered
,
averting
her
gaze
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
then
,
I
must
tear
myself
away
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
return
shortly
,
and
trust
to
find
your
father
less
flinty
-
hearted
than
he
is
represented
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
clasped
Amabel
in
his
arms
,
and
perhaps
snatched
a
kiss
,
if
her
mother
had
not
rushed
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
more
familiarities
,
sir
,
"
she
cried
angrily
;
"
no
court
manners
here
.
<EOS>
If
you
look
to
we
d
<EOS>
my
daughter
,
you
must
conduct
yourself
more
decorously
;
but
I
can
tell
you
,
you
have
no
chance
--
none
whatever
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Time
will
show
,
"
replied
Wyvil
,
audaciously
.
"
You
had
better
give
her
to
me
quietly
,
and
save
me
the
trouble
of
carrying
her
off,--for
have
her
I
will
.
"
 
"
Mercy
on
us
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
in
accents
of
alarm
;
"
now
his
wicked
intentions
are
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Fear
nothing
,
mother
,
"
observed
Amabel
,
coldly
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
scarcely
carry
me
off
without
my
own
consent
;
and
I
am
not
likely
to
sacrifice
myself
for
one
who
holds
me
in
such
light
esteem
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Forgive
me
,
Amabel
,
"
rejoined
Wyvil
,
in
a
voice
so
penitent
that
it
instantly
effaced
her
displeasure
;
"
I
meant
not
to
offend
.
<EOS>
I
spoke
only
the
language
of
distraction
.
<EOS>
Do
not
dismiss
me
thus
,
or
my
death
will
lie
at
your
door
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
sorry
for
that
,
"
she
replied
;
"
but
,
inexperienced
<EOS>
as
I
am
,
I
feel
this
is
not
the
language
of
real
regard
,
but
of
furious
passion
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
dark
shade
passed
over
Wyvil
's
handsome
features
,
and
the
almost
feminine
beauty
by
which
they
were
characterized
gave
place
to
a
fierce
and
forbidding
expression
.
<EOS>
Controlling
himself
by
a
powerful
effort
,
he
replied
,
with
forced
calmness
,
"
Amabel
,
you
know
not
what
it
is
to
love
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
stir
hence
till
I
have
seen
your
father
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
see
that
,
sir
,
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
,
ho
!
<EOS>
son
Stephen
!
<EOS>
Leonard
Holt
!
<EOS>
I
say
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
_
will
_
stay
here
,
whether
I
like
or
not
.
<EOS>
Show
him
forth
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
will
,
right
willingly
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
,
rushing
before
the
younger
Bloundel
,
and
flourishing
his
formidable
cudgel
.
<EOS>
"
Out
with
you
,
sir
!
<EOS>
Out
with
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
at
your
bidding
you
,
saucy
knave
,
"
rejoined
Wyvil
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
sword
:
"
and
if
it
were
not
for
the
presence
of
your
mistress
and
her
lovely
daughter
,
I
would
crop
your
ears
for
your
insolence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Their
presence
shall
not
prevent
me
from
making
my
cudgel
and
your
shoulders
acquainted
,
if
you
do
not
budge
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
,
sturdily
.
 
<EOS>
Enraged
by
the
retort
,
Wyvil
would
have
drawn
his
sword
,
but
a
blow
on
the
arm
disabled
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Plague
on
you
,
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
;
"
you
shall
rue
this
to
the
last
day
of
your
existence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Threaten
those
who
heed
you
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
about
to
repeat
the
blow
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
him
no
further
injury
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Amabel
,
arresting
his
hand
,
and
looking
with
the
greatest
commiseration
at
Wyvil
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
dealt
with
him
far
too
rudely
already
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Since
I
have
your
sympathy
,
sweet
Amabel
,
"
rejoined
Wyvil
,
"
I
care
not
<EOS>
what
rude
treatment
I
experience
from
this
churl
.
<EOS>
We
shall
soon
meet
again
.
"
<EOS>
And
bowing
to
her
,
he
strode
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Leonard
followed
him
to
the
shop
-
door
,
hoping
some
further
pretext
for
quarrel
would
arise
,
but
he
was
disappointed
.
<EOS>
Wyvil
took
no
notice
of
him
,
and
proceeded
at
a
slow
pace
towards
Cheapside
.
 
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
afterwards
,
Stephen
Bloundel
came
home
.
<EOS>
On
being
informed
of
what
had
occurred
,
he
was
greatly
annoyed
,
though
he
concealed
his
vexation
,
and
highly
applauded
his
daughter
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
Without
further
comment
,
he
proceeded
about
his
business
,
and
remained
in
the
shop
till
it
was
closed
.
<EOS>
Wyvil
did
not
return
,
and
the
grocer
tried
to
persuade
himself
they
should
see
nothing
more
of
him
.
<EOS>
Before
Amabel
retired
to
rest
,
he
imprinted
a
kiss
on
her
snowy
brow
,
and
said
,
in
a
tone
of
the
utmost
kindness
,
"
You
have
never
yet
deceived
me
,
child
,
and
I
hope
never
will
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
truly
,
do
you
take
any
interest
in
this
young
gallant
?
"
 
<EOS>
Amabel
blushed
deeply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
speak
the
truth
,
father
,
"
she
rejoined
,
after
a
pause
,
"
if
I
were
to
say
I
do
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
it
,
"
replied
Bloundel
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
would
not
be
happy
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
he
is
unprincipled
and
profligate:--you
must
forget
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
to
do
so
,
"
sighed
Amabel
.
<EOS>
And
the
conversation
dropped
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
,
Maurice
Wyvil
entered
the
grocer
's
shop
.
<EOS>
He
was
more
richly
attired
than
before
,
and
there
was
a
haughtiness
in
his
manner
which
he
had
not
hitherto
assumed
.
<EOS>
What
passed
between
him
and
Bloundel
was
not
known
,
for
the
latter
never
spoke
of
it
;
but
the
result
may
be
gathered
from
the
fact
that
the
young
gallant
was
not
allowed
an
interview
with
the
grocer
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
moment
the
change
previously
noticed
took
place
in
Amabel
's
demeanour
towards
Leonard
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
scarcely
able
to
endure
his
presence
,
and
sedulously
avoided
his
regards
.
<EOS>
From
being
habitually
gay
and
cheerful
,
she
became
pensive
and
reserved
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
more
than
once
caught
her
in
tears
;
and
it
was
evident
,
from
many
other
signs
,
that
Wyvil
completely
engrossed
her
thoughts
.
<EOS>
Fully
aware
of
this
,
Mrs.
Bloundel
said
nothing
of
it
to
her
husband
,
because
the
subject
was
painful
to
him
;
and
not
supposing
the
passion
deeply
rooted
,
she
hoped
it
would
speedily
wear
away
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
mistaken
--
the
flame
was
kept
alive
in
Amabel
's
breast
in
a
manner
of
which
she
was
totally
ignorant
.
<EOS>
Wyvil
found
means
to
deceive
the
vigilance
of
the
grocer
and
his
wife
,
but
he
could
not
deceive
the
vigilance
of
a
jealous
lover
.
<EOS>
Leonard
discovered
that
his
mistress
had
received
a
letter
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
betray
her
,
but
he
determined
to
watch
her
narrowly
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
when
she
went
forth
one
morning
in
company
with
her
younger
sister
(
a
little
girl
of
some
five
years
old
)
,
he
made
an
excuse
to
follow
them
,
and
,
keeping
within
sight
,
perceived
them
enter
Saint
Paul
's
Cathedral
,
the
mid
aisle
of
which
was
then
converted
into
a
public
walk
,
and
generally
thronged
with
town
gallants
,
bullies
,
bona
-
robas
,
cut
-
purses
,
and
rogues
of
every
description
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
it
was
the
haunt
of
the
worst
of
characters
of
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
When
,
therefore
,
Amabel
entered
this
structure
,
Leonard
felt
certain
it
was
to
meet
her
lover
.
<EOS>
Rushing
forward
,
he
saw
her
take
her
course
through
the
crowd
,
and
attract
general
attention
from
her
loveliness
--
but
he
nowhere
discerned
Maurice
Wyvil
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
however
,
she
struck
off
to
the
right
,
and
halted
near
one
of
the
pillars
,
and
the
apprentice
,
advancing
,
detected
his
rival
behind
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
whispering
a
few
words
in
her
ear
,
unperceived
by
her
sister
.
<EOS>
Maddened
by
the
sight
,
Leonard
hurried
towards
them
,
but
before
he
could
reach
the
spot
Wyvil
was
gone
,
and
Amabel
,
though
greatly
confused
,
looked
at
the
same
time
so
indignant
,
that
he
almost
regretted
his
precipitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
,
of
course
,
make
known
to
my
father
what
you
have
just
seen
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
in
a
low
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
promise
not
to
meet
that
gallant
again
without
my
knowledge
,
I
will
not
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
reflection
,
Amabel
gave
the
required
promise
,
and
they
returned
to
Wood
-
street
together
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
she
would
not
break
her
word
,
the
apprentice
became
more
easy
,
and
as
a
week
elapsed
,
and
nothing
was
said
to
him
on
the
subject
,
he
persuaded
himself
she
would
not
attempt
to
meet
her
lover
again
.
 
<EOS>
Things
were
in
this
state
at
the
opening
of
our
tale
,
but
upon
the
night
in
question
,
Leonard
fancied
he
discerned
some
agitation
in
Amabel
's
manner
towards
him
,
and
in
consequence
of
this
notion
,
he
sought
to
meet
her
gaze
,
as
before
related
,
after
prayers
.
<EOS>
While
trying
to
distract
his
thoughts
by
arranging
sundry
firkins
of
butter
,
and
putting
other
things
in
order
,
he
heard
a
light
footstep
behind
him
,
and
turning
at
the
sound
,
beheld
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leonard
,
"
she
whispered
,
"
I
promised
to
tell
you
when
I
should
next
meet
Maurice
Wyvil
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
here
to
-
night
.
"
<EOS>
And
without
giving
him
time
to
answer
,
she
retired
.
 
<EOS>
For
awhile
,
Leonard
remained
in
a
state
almost
of
stupefaction
,
repeating
to
himself
,
as
if
unwilling
to
believe
them
,
the
words
he
had
just
heard
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
recovered
when
the
grocer
entered
the
shop
,
and
noticing
his
haggard
looks
,
kindly
inquired
if
he
felt
unwell
.
<EOS>
The
apprentice
returned
an
evasive
answer
,
and
half
determined
to
relate
all
he
knew
to
his
master
,
but
the
next
moment
he
changed
his
intention
,
and
,
influenced
by
that
chivalric
feeling
which
always
governs
those
,
of
whatever
condition
,
who
love
profoundly
,
resolved
not
to
betray
the
thoughtless
girl
,
but
to
trust
to
his
own
ingenuity
to
thwart
the
designs
of
his
rival
,
and
preserve
her
Acting
upon
this
resolution
,
he
said
he
had
a
slight
headache
,
and
instantly
resumed
his
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
At
nine
o'clock
,
the
whole
family
assembled
at
supper
.
<EOS>
The
board
was
plentifully
though
plainly
spread
,
but
the
grocer
observed
,
with
some
uneasiness
,
that
his
apprentice
,
who
had
a
good
appetite
in
ordinary
,
ate
little
or
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
kept
his
eye
constantly
upon
him
,
and
became
convinced
from
his
manner
that
something
ailed
him
.
<EOS>
Not
having
any
notion
of
the
truth
,
and
being
filled
with
apprehensions
of
the
plague
,
his
dread
was
that
Leonard
was
infected
by
the
disease
.
<EOS>
Supper
was
generally
the
pleasantest
meal
of
the
day
at
the
grocer
's
house
,
but
on
this
occasion
it
passed
off
cheerlessly
enough
,
and
a
circumstance
occurred
at
its
close
which
threw
all
into
confusion
and
distress
.
<EOS>
Before
relating
this
,
however
,
we
must
complete
our
description
of
the
family
under
their
present
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
Tall
,
and
of
a
spare
frame
,
with
good
features
,
somewhat
austere
in
their
expression
,
and
of
the
cast
which
we
are
apt
to
term
precise
and
puritanical
,
but
tempered
with
great
benevolence
,
Stephen
Bloundel
had
a
keen
,
deep
-
seated
eye
,
overshadowed
by
thick
brows
,
and
suffered
his
long
-
flowing
grey
hair
to
descend
over
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
was
high
and
ample
,
his
chin
square
and
well
defined
,
and
his
general
appearance
exceedingly
striking
.
<EOS>
In
age
he
was
about
fifty
.
<EOS>
His
integrity
and
fairness
of
dealing
,
never
once
called
in
question
for
a
period
of
thirty
years
,
had
won
him
the
esteem
of
all
who
knew
him
;
while
his
prudence
and
economy
had
enabled
him
,
during
that
time
,
to
amass
a
tolerable
fortune
.
<EOS>
His
methodical
habits
,
and
strong
religious
principles
,
have
been
already
mentioned
.
<EOS>
His
eldest
son
was
named
after
him
,
and
resembled
him
both
in
person
and
character
,
promising
to
tread
in
his
footsteps
.
<EOS>
The
younger
sons
require
little
notice
at
present
.
<EOS>
One
was
twelve
,
and
the
other
only
half
that
age
;
but
both
appeared
to
inherit
many
of
their
father
's
good
qualities
.
<EOS>
Basil
,
the
elder
,
was
a
stout
,
well
-
grown
lad
,
and
had
never
known
a
day
's
ill
-
health
;
while
Hubert
,
the
younger
,
was
thin
,
delicate
,
and
constantly
ailing
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bloundel
was
a
specimen
of
a
city
dame
of
the
best
kind
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
few
pardonable
vanities
,
which
no
arguments
could
overcome
--
such
as
a
little
ostentation
in
dress
--
a
little
pride
in
the
neatness
of
her
house
--
and
a
good
deal
in
the
beauty
of
her
children
,
especially
in
that
of
Amabel
--
as
well
as
in
the
wealth
and
high
character
of
her
husband
,
whom
she
regarded
as
the
most
perfect
of
human
beings
.
<EOS>
These
slight
failings
allowed
for
,
nothing
but
good
remained
.
<EOS>
Her
conduct
was
exemplary
in
all
the
relations
of
life
.
<EOS>
The
tenderest
of
mothers
,
and
the
most
affectionate
of
wives
<EOS>
,
she
had
as
much
genuine
piety
and
strictness
of
moral
principles
as
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Short
,
plump
,
and
well
-
proportioned
,
<EOS>
though
somewhat
,
perhaps
,
exceeding
the
rules
of
symmetry
--
she
had
a
rich
olive
complexion
,
fine
black
eyes
,
beaming
with
good
nature
,
and
an
ever
-
laughing
mouth
,
ornamented
by
a
beautiful
set
of
teeth
.
<EOS>
To
wind
up
all
,
she
was
a
few
years
younger
than
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Amabel
has
already
been
described
.
<EOS>
The
youngest
girl
,
Christiana
,
was
a
pretty
little
dove
-
eyed
,
flaxen
-
haired
child
,
between
four
and
five
years
old
,
and
shared
the
fate
of
most
younger
children
,
being
very
much
caressed
,
and
not
a
little
spoiled
by
her
parents
.
 
<EOS>
The
foregoing
description
of
the
grocer
's
family
would
be
incomplete
without
some
mention
of
his
household
.
<EOS>
Old
Josyna
Shotterel
,
the
cook
,
who
had
lived
with
her
master
ever
since
his
marriage
,
and
had
the
strongest
attachment
for
him
,
was
a
hale
,
stout
dame
,
of
about
sixty
,
with
few
infirmities
for
her
years
,
and
with
less
asperity
of
temper
than
generally
belongs
to
servants
of
her
class
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
native
of
Holland
,
and
came
to
England
early
in
life
,
where
she
married
Blaize
's
father
,
who
died
soon
after
their
union
.
<EOS>
An
excellent
cook
in
a
plain
way
--
indeed
,
she
had
no
practice
in
any
other
--
she
would
brew
strong
ale
and
mead
,
or
mix
a
sack
-
posset
with
,
any
innkeeper
in
the
city
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
she
was
a
careful
and
tender
nurse
,
if
her
services
were
ever
required
in
that
capacity
.
<EOS>
The
children
looked
upon
her
as
a
second
mother
;
and
her
affection
for
them
,
which
was
unbounded
,
deserved
their
regard
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
perfect
storehouse
of
what
are
termed
"
old
women
's
receipts
;
"
and
there
were
few
complaints
(
except
the
plague
)
for
which
she
did
not
think
herself
qualified
to
prescribe
and
able
to
cure
.
<EOS>
Her
skill
in
the
healing
art
was
often
tested
by
her
charitable
mistress
,
who
required
her
to
prepare
remedies
,
as
well
as
nourishing
broths
,
for
such
of
the
poor
of
the
parish
as
applied
to
her
for
relief
at
times
of
sickness
.
 
<EOS>
Her
son
,
Blaize
,
was
a
stout
,
stumpy
fellow
,
about
four
feet
ten
,
with
a
head
somewhat
too
large
for
his
body
,
and
extremely
long
arms
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
the
plague
had
broken
out
in
Drury
-
lane
,
it
haunted
him
like
a
spectre
,
and
scattered
the
few
faculties
he
possessed
.
<EOS>
In
vain
he
tried
to
combat
his
alarm
--
in
vain
his
mother
endeavoured
to
laugh
him
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
Nothing
would
do
.
<EOS>
He
read
the
bills
of
mortality
daily
;
ascertained
the
particulars
of
every
case
;
dilated
upon
the
agonies
of
the
sufferers
;
watched
the
progress
of
the
infection
,
and
calculated
the
time
it
would
take
to
reach
Wood
-
street
.
<EOS>
He
talked
of
the
pestilence
by
day
,
and
dreamed
of
it
at
night
;
and
more
than
once
alarmed
the
house
by
roaring
for
assistance
,
under
the
idea
that
he
was
suddenly
attacked
.
<EOS>
By
his
mother
's
advice
,
he
steeped
rue
,
wormwood
,
and
sage
in
his
drink
,
till
it
was
so
abominably
nauseous
that
he
could
scarcely
swallow
it
,
and
carried
a
small
ball
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
,
compounded
of
wax
,
angelica
,
camphor
,
and
other
drugs
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
chewed
a
small
piece
of
Virginian
snake
-
root
,
or
zedoary
,
if
he
approached
any
place
supposed
to
be
infected
.
<EOS>
A
dried
toad
was
suspended
round
his
neck
,
as
an
amulet
of
sovereign
virtue
.
<EOS>
Every
nostrum
sold
by
the
quacks
in
the
streets
tempted
him
;
and
a
few
days
before
,
he
had
expended
his
last
crown
in
the
purchase
of
a
bottle
of
plague
-
water
.
<EOS>
Being
of
a
superstitious
nature
,
he
placed
full
faith
in
all
the
predictions
of
the
astrologers
,
who
foretold
that
London
should
be
utterly
laid
waste
,
that
grass
should
grow
in
the
streets
,
and
that
the
living
should
not
be
able
to
bury
the
dead
.
<EOS>
He
quaked
at
the
terrible
denunciations
of
the
preachers
,
who
exhorted
their
hearers
to
repentance
,
telling
them
a
judgment
was
at
hand
,
and
shuddered
at
the
wild
and
fearful
prophesying
of
the
insane
enthusiasts
who
roamed
the
streets
.
<EOS>
His
nativity
having
been
cast
,
and
it
appearing
that
he
would
be
in
great
danger
on
the
20th
of
June
,
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
should
die
of
the
plague
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
Before
he
was
assailed
by
these
terrors
,
he
had
entertained
a
sneaking
attachment
for
Patience
,
the
kitchen
-
maid
,
a
young
and
buxom
damsel
,
who
had
no
especial
objection
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
of
late
,
his
love
had
given
way
to
apprehension
,
and
his
whole
thoughts
were
centred
in
one
idea
,
namely
,
self
-
preservation
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
supper
was
over
,
and
the
family
were
about
to
separate
for
the
night
,
when
Stephen
,
the
grocer
's
eldest
son
,
having
risen
to
quit
the
room
,
staggered
and
complained
of
a
strange
dizziness
and
headache
,
which
almost
deprived
him
of
sight
,
while
his
heart
palpitated
frightfully
.
<EOS>
A
dreadful
suspicion
seized
his
father
.
<EOS>
He
ran
towards
him
,
and
assisted
him
to
a
seat
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
the
young
man
reached
it
,
when
a
violent
sickness
seized
him
;
a
greenish
-
coloured
froth
appeared
at
the
mouth
,
and
he
began
to
grow
delirious
.
<EOS>
Guided
by
the
convulsive
efforts
of
the
sufferer
,
Bloundel
tore
off
his
clothes
,
and
after
a
moment
's
search
,
perceived
under
the
left
arm
a
livid
pustule
.
<EOS>
He
uttered
a
cry
of
anguish
.
<EOS>
His
son
was
plague
-
stricken
.

<EOS>
THE
COFFIN
-
MAKER
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
shock
over
,
the
grocer
bore
the
affliction
manfully
,
and
like
one
prepared
for
it
.
<EOS>
Exhibiting
little
outward
emotion
,
though
his
heart
was
torn
with
anguish
,
and
acting
with
the
utmost
calmness
,
he
forbade
his
wife
to
approach
the
sufferer
,
and
desired
her
instantly
to
retire
to
her
own
room
with
her
daughters
;
and
not
to
leave
it
on
any
consideration
whatever
,
without
his
permission
.
 
<EOS>
Accustomed
to
regard
her
husband
's
word
as
law
,
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
,
disputed
his
authority
,
and
,
falling
on
her
knees
,
besought
him
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
to
allow
her
to
nurse
her
son
.
<EOS>
But
he
remained
inflexible
,
and
she
was
forced
to
comply
.
 
<EOS>
He
next
gave
similar
directions
to
old
Josyna
respecting
his
two
younger
sons
,
with
this
difference
only
,
that
when
they
were
put
to
rest
,
and
the
door
was
locked
upon
them
,
she
was
to
return
to
the
kitchen
and
prepare
a
posset
-
drink
of
canary
and
spirits
of
sulphur
,
together
with
a
poultice
of
mallows
,
lily
-
roots
,
figs
,
linseed
,
and
palm
-
oil
,
for
the
patient
.
 
<EOS>
These
orders
given
and
obeyed
,
with
Leonard
Holt
's
assistance
-
for
Blaize
,
who
had
crept
into
a
corner
,
in
extremity
of
terror
,
was
wholly
incapable
of
rendering
any
help
-
he
conveyed
his
son
to
the
adjoining
room
,
on
the
ground
floor
,
where
there
was
a
bed
,
and
placing
him
within
it
,
heaped
blankets
upon
him
to
promote
profuse
perspiration
,
while
the
apprentice
lighted
a
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Provided
with
the
most
efficacious
remedies
for
the
distemper
,
and
acquainted
with
the
mode
of
treating
it
prescribed
by
the
College
of
Physicians
,
Bloundel
was
at
no
loss
how
to
act
,
but
,
rubbing
the
part
affected
with
a
stimulating
ointment
<EOS>
,
he
administered
at
the
same
time
doses
of
mithridate
,
Venice
treacle
,
and
other
potent
alexipharmics
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
soon
the
satisfaction
of
perceiving
that
his
son
became
somewhat
easier
;
and
after
swallowing
the
posset
-
drink
prepared
by
old
Josyna
,
who
used
all
the
expedition
she
could
,
a
moisture
broke
out
upon
the
youth
's
skin
,
and
appeared
to
relieve
him
so
much
,
that
,
but
for
the
ghastly
paleness
of
his
countenance
,
and
the
muddy
look
of
his
eye
,
his
father
would
have
indulged
a
hope
of
his
recovery
.
 
<EOS>
Up
to
this
time
,
the
grocer
had
acted
for
himself
,
and
felt
confident
he
had
acted
rightly
;
but
he
now
deemed
it
expedient
to
call
in
advice
,
and
,
accordingly
,
commissioned
his
apprentice
to
fetch
Doctor
Hodges
,
a
physician
,
residing
in
Great
Knightrider
-
street
,
Doctors
'
Commons
,
who
had
recently
acquired
considerable
reputation
for
his
skilful
treatment
of
those
attacked
by
the
plague
,
and
who
(
it
may
be
incidentally
mentioned
)
afterwards
gave
to
the
medical
world
a
curious
account
of
the
ravages
of
the
disorder
,
as
well
as
of
his
own
professional
experiences
during
this
terrible
period
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
told
him
--
and
he
could
not
repress
a
sigh
as
he
did
so
--
to
give
notice
to
the
Examiner
of
Health
(
there
were
one
or
two
officers
,
so
designated
,
appointed
to
every
parish
,
at
this
awful
season
,
by
the
city
authorities
)
that
his
house
was
infected
.
 
<EOS>
While
preparing
to
set
out
,
Leonard
again
debated
with
himself
whether
he
should
acquaint
his
master
with
Maurice
Wyvil
's
meditated
visit
.
<EOS>
But
conceiving
it
wholly
impossible
that
Amabel
could
leave
her
mother
's
room
,
even
if
she
were
disposed
to
do
so
,
he
determined
to
let
the
affair
take
its
course
.
<EOS>
On
his
way
to
the
shop
,
he
entered
a
small
room
occupied
by
Blaize
,
and
found
him
seated
near
a
table
,
with
his
hands
upon
his
knees
,
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
,
looking
the
very
image
of
despair
.
<EOS>
The
atmosphere
smelt
like
that
of
an
apothecary
's
shop
,
and
was
so
overpowering
,
that
Leonard
could
scarcely
breathe
.
<EOS>
The
table
was
covered
with
pill
-
boxes
and
phials
,
most
of
which
were
emptied
,
and
a
dim
light
was
afforded
by
a
candle
with
a
most
portentous
crest
of
snuff
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
you
have
been
poisoning
yourself
,
I
perceive
,
"
observed
Leonard
,
approaching
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Keep
off
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
porter
,
springing
suddenly
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
touch
me
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
Poisoning
myself
!
<EOS>
I
have
taken
three
rufuses
,
or
pestilential
pills
;
two
spoonfuls
of
alexiteral
water
;
the
same
quantity
of
anti
-
pestilential
decoction
;
half
as
much
of
Sir
Theodore
Mayerne
's
electuary
;
and
a
large
dose
of
orvietan
.
<EOS>
Do
you
call
that
poisoning
myself
?
<EOS>
I
call
it
taking
proper
precaution
,
and
would
recommend
you
to
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
Beside
this
,
I
have
sprinkled
myself
with
vinegar
,
fumigated
my
clothes
,
and
rubbed
my
nose
,
inside
and
out
,
till
it
smarted
so
intolerably
,
I
was
obliged
to
desist
,
with
balsam
of
sulphur
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
if
you
do
n't
escape
the
plague
,
it
wo
n't
be
your
fault
,
"
returned
Leonard
,
scarcely
able
to
refrain
from
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
something
to
tell
you
before
I
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Blaize
,
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
Where
--
where
are
you
going
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
fetch
the
doctor
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
Master
Stephen
worse
?
"
rejoined
the
porter
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
I
hope
he
is
better
,
"
replied
Leonard
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
back
directly
,
but
as
I
have
to
give
notice
to
the
Examiner
of
Health
that
the
house
is
infected
,
I
may
be
detained
a
few
minutes
longer
than
I
anticipate
.
<EOS>
Keep
the
street
-
door
locked
;
I
will
fasten
the
yard
-
gate
,
and
do
not
for
your
life
let
any
one
in
,
except
Doctor
Hodges
,
till
I
return
.
<EOS>
Do
you
hear?--do
<EOS>
you
understand
what
I
say
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
hear
plain
enough
,
"
growled
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
You
say
that
the
house
is
infected
,
and
that
we
shall
all
be
locked
up
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dolt
!
"
exclaimed
the
apprentice
<EOS>
,
"
I
said
no
such
thing
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
repeated
his
injunctions
,
but
Blaize
was
too
much
terrified
to
comprehend
them
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
losing
all
patience
,
Leonard
cried
in
a
menacing
tone
,
"
If
you
do
not
attend
to
me
,
I
will
cudgel
you
within
an
inch
of
your
life
,
and
you
will
find
the
thrashing
harder
to
bear
even
than
the
plague
itself
.
<EOS>
Rouse
yourself
,
fool
,
and
follow
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Accompanied
by
the
porter
,
he
hurried
to
the
yard
-
gate
,
saw
it
bolted
within
-
side
,
and
then
returned
to
the
shop
,
where
,
having
found
his
cap
and
cudgel
,
he
directed
Blaize
to
lock
the
door
after
him
,
cautioning
him
,
for
the
third
time
,
not
to
admit
any
one
except
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
find
,
on
my
return
,
that
you
have
neglected
my
injunctions
,
"
he
concluded
,
"
as
sure
as
I
now
stand
before
you
,
I
'll
break
every
bone
in
your
body
.
"
 
<EOS>
Blaize
promised
obedience
,
adding
in
a
supplicating
tone
,
"
Leonard
,
if
I
were
you
,
I
would
not
go
to
the
Examiner
of
Health
.
<EOS>
Poor
Stephen
may
not
have
the
plague
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
dreadful
thing
to
be
imprisoned
for
a
month
,
for
that
's
the
time
appointed
by
the
Lord
Mayor
.
<EOS>
Only
a
week
ago
I
passed
several
houses
in
Holborn
,
shut
up
on
account
of
the
plague
,
with
a
watchman
at
the
door
,
and
I
never
shall
forget
the
melancholy
faces
I
saw
at
the
windows
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
dreadful
spectacle
,
and
has
haunted
me
ever
since
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
helped
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
,
with
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
If
we
disobey
the
Lord
Mayor
's
orders
,
and
neglect
giving
information
,
we
shall
all
be
sent
to
Newgate
,
while
poor
Stephen
will
be
taken
to
the
pest
-
house
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
searchers
will
be
here
before
morning
.
<EOS>
They
are
sure
to
learn
what
has
happened
from
Doctor
Hodges
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
true
,
"
replied
Blaize
;
"
I
had
forgotten
that
.
<EOS>
Let
me
go
with
you
,
dear
Leonard
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
remain
here
longer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
would
you
leave
your
kind
good
master
,
at
a
time
like
this
,
when
he
most
needs
your
services
?
"
rejoined
Leonard
,
reproachfully
.
<EOS>
"
Out
,
cowardly
hound
!
<EOS>
I
am
ashamed
of
you
.
<EOS>
Shake
off
your
fears
,
and
be
a
man
.
<EOS>
You
can
but
die
once
;
and
what
matters
it
whether
you
die
of
the
plague
or
the
cholic
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
matters
a
great
deal
,
"
replied
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
of
nothing
but
the
plague
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
shall
be
its
next
victim
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
right
<EOS>
--
I
can
not
desert
my
kind
master
,
nor
my
old
mother
.
<EOS>
Farewell
,
Leonard
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
we
may
never
meet
again
.
<EOS>
I
may
be
dead
before
you
come
back
.
<EOS>
I
feel
very
ill
already
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
wonder
,
after
all
the
stuff
you
have
swallowed
,
"
returned
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
But
pluck
up
your
courage
,
or
you
will
bring
on
the
very
thing
you
are
anxious
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
As
many
people
have
died
from
fear
as
from
any
other
cause
.
<EOS>
One
word
before
I
go
.
<EOS>
If
any
one
should
get
into
the
house
by
scaling
the
yard
-
wall
,
or
through
the
window
,
instantly
alarm
our
master
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
returned
Blaize
,
with
a
look
of
surprise
,
"
But
do
you
expect
any
one
to
enter
the
house
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ask
no
questions
,
but
do
as
I
bid
you
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
,
opening
the
door
,
and
about
to
go
forth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
moment
,
"
cried
Blaize
,
detaining
him
,
and
drawing
from
his
pocket
a
handful
of
simples
.
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
take
some
of
them
with
you
to
guard
against
infection
?
<EOS>
There
's
wormwood
,
woodsorrel
,
masterwort
,
zedoary
,
and
angelica
;
and
lastly
,
there
is
a
little
bottle
of
the
sovereign
preservative
against
the
plague
,
as
prepared
by
the
great
Lord
Bacon
,
and
approved
by
Queen
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
take
_
that
_
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
fear
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
shutting
the
door
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
lingered
for
a
moment
while
it
was
locked
,
he
heard
Blaize
say
to
himself
,
"
I
must
go
and
take
three
more
rufuses
and
a
large
dose
of
diascordium
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
bright
moonlight
night
,
and
as
the
apprentice
turned
to
depart
,
he
perceived
a
figure
hastily
retreating
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
Making
sure
it
was
Maurice
Wyvil
,
though
he
could
not
distinguish
the
garb
of
the
person
--
that
side
of
the
street
being
in
the
shade
--
and
stung
by
jealousy
,
he
immediately
started
in
pursuit
.
<EOS>
The
fugitive
struck
down
Lad
-
lane
,
and
run
on
till
he
came
to
the
end
of
Lawrence
-
lane
,
where
,
finding
himself
closely
pressed
,
he
suddenly
halted
,
and
pulling
his
hat
over
his
brows
to
conceal
his
features
,
fiercely
confronted
his
pursuer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
follow
me
thus
,
rascal
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
drawing
his
sword
.
"
<EOS>
Would
you
rob
me
?
<EOS>
Begone
,
or
I
will
call
the
watch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
_
is
_
his
voice
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
news
for
you
,
Mr.
Maurice
Wyvil
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
see
Amabel
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
The
plague
is
in
her
father
's
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
plague
!
"
exclaimed
Wyvil
,
in
an
altered
tone
,
and
dropping
the
point
of
his
sword
.
<EOS>
"
Is
she
smitten
by
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
apprentice
answered
by
a
bitter
laugh
,
and
without
tarrying
longer
to
enjoy
his
rival
's
distress
,
set
off
towards
Cheapside
.
<EOS>
Before
reaching
the
end
of
Lawrence
-
lane
,
however
,
he
half
-
repented
his
conduct
,
and
halted
to
see
whether
Wyvil
was
following
him
;
but
as
he
could
perceive
nothing
of
him
,
he
continued
his
course
.
 
<EOS>
Entering
Cheapside
,
he
observed
,
to
his
surprise
,
a
crowd
of
persons
collected
near
the
Cross
,
then
standing
a
little
to
the
east
of
Wood
-
street
.
<EOS>
This
cross
,
which
was
of
great
antiquity
,
and
had
undergone
many
mutilations
and
alterations
since
its
erection
in
1486
,
when
it
boasted
,
amongst
other
embellishments
,
images
of
the
Virgin
and
Saint
Edward
the
Confessor
,
was
still
not
without
some
pretensions
to
architectural
beauty
.
<EOS>
In
form
it
was
hexagonal
,
and
composed
of
three
tiers
,
rising
from
one
another
like
the
divisions
of
a
telescope
,
each
angle
being
supported
by
a
pillar
surmounted
by
a
statue
,
while
the
intervening
niches
were
filled
up
with
sculptures
,
intended
to
represent
some
of
the
sovereigns
of
England
.
<EOS>
The
structure
was
of
considerable
height
,
and
crowned
by
a
large
gilt
cross
.
<EOS>
Its
base
was
protected
by
a
strong
wooden
railing
.
<EOS>
About
a
hundred
yards
to
the
east
,
there
stood
a
smaller
hexagonal
tower
,
likewise
ornamented
with
carvings
,
and
having
a
figure
on
its
conical
summit
blowing
a
horn
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
Conduit
.
<EOS>
Midway
between
these
buildings
the
crowd
alluded
to
above
was
collected
.
 
<EOS>
As
Leonard
drew
near
,
he
found
the
assemblage
was
listening
to
the
exhortations
of
an
enthusiast
,
whom
he
instantly
recognised
from
a
description
he
had
heard
of
him
from
Blaize
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
this
half
-
crazed
being
was
Solomon
Eagle
.
<EOS>
Originally
a
Quaker
,
upon
the
outbreak
of
the
plague
he
had
abandoned
his
home
and
friends
,
and
roamed
the
streets
at
night
,
denouncing
doom
to
the
city
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
gaunt
man
,
with
long
jet
-
black
hair
hanging
in
disordered
masses
over
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
large
and
black
,
and
blazed
with
insane
lustre
,
and
his
looks
were
so
wild
and
terrific
,
that
it
required
no
great
stretch
of
imagination
to
convert
him
into
the
genius
of
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
Entirely
stripped
of
apparel
except
that
his
loins
were
girt
with
a
sheep
-
skin
,
in
imitation
of
Saint
John
in
the
Wilderness
,
he
bore
upon
his
head
a
brazier
of
flaming
coals
,
the
lurid
light
of
which
falling
upon
his
sable
locks
and
tawny
skin
,
gave
him
an
unearthly
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Impelled
by
curiosity
,
Leonard
paused
for
a
moment
to
listen
,
and
heard
him
thunder
forth
the
following
denunciation:--"And
<EOS>
now
,
therefore
,
as
the
prophet
Jeremiah
saith
,
'
I
have
this
day
declared
it
to
you
,
but
ye
have
not
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
Lord
your
God
,
nor
anything
for
the
which
<EOS>
he
hath
sent
me
unto
you
.
<EOS>
Now
,
therefore
,
know
certainly
that
ye
shall
die
by
the
sword
,
by
the
famine
,
and
by
the
pestilence
.
'
<EOS>
Again
,
in
the
words
of
the
prophet
Amos
,
the
Lord
saith
unto
YOU
by
my
mouth
,
'
I
have
sent
among
you
the
pestilence
after
the
manner
of
Egypt
,
yet
have
you
not
returned
unto
me
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
will
I
do
this
unto
thee
,
O
Israel
;
and
because
I
will
do
this
unto
thee
,
prepare
to
meet
thy
God
?
'
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
this
,
O
sinners
?
<EOS>
God
will
proceed
against
you
in
the
day
of
His
wrath
,
though
He
hath
borne
with
you
in
the
day
of
His
patience
?
<EOS>
O
how
many
hundred
years
hath
<EOS>
He
spared
this
city
,
notwithstanding
its
great
provocations
and
wickedness
!
<EOS>
But
now
He
will
no
longer
show
it
pity
,
but
will
pour
out
His
wrath
upon
it
<EOS>
I
Plagues
shall
come
upon
it
,
and
desolation
;
and
it
shall
be
utterly
burnt
with
fire,--for
strong
<EOS>
is
the
Lord
who
judgeth
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
His
address
concluded
,
the
enthusiast
started
off
at
a
swift
pace
,
shrieking
,
in
a
voice
that
caused
many
persons
to
throw
open
their
windows
to
listen
to
him
,
"
Awake
!
<EOS>
sinners
,
awake'--the
plague
is
at
your
doors!--the
grave
yawns
for
you!--awake
,
and
repent
!
"
<EOS>
And
followed
by
the
crowd
,
many
of
whom
kept
up
with
him
,
he
ran
on
vociferating
in
this
manner
till
he
was
out
of
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
Hurrying
forward
in
the
opposite
direction
,
Leonard
glanced
at
the
ancient
and
picturesque
houses
on
either
side
of
the
way,--now
<EOS>
bathed
in
the
moonlight
,
and
apparently
hushed
in
repose
<EOS>
and
security,--and
he
could
not
repress
a
shudder
as
he
reflected
that
an
evil
angel
was
,
indeed
,
abroad
,
who
might
suddenly
arouse
their
slumbering
inmates
to
despair
and
death
.
<EOS>
His
thoughts
took
another
turn
as
he
entered
the
precincts
of
Saint
Paul
's
,
and
surveyed
the
venerable
and
majestic
fabric
before
him
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
rested
upon
its
innumerable
crocketed
pinnacles
,
its
buttresses
,
its
battlements
,
and
upon
the
magnificent
rose
-
window
terminating
the
choir
.
<EOS>
The
apprentice
had
no
especial
love
for
antiquity
,
but
being
of
an
imaginative
turn
,
the
sight
of
this
reverend
structure
conjured
up
old
recollections
,
and
brought
to
mind
the
noble
Collegiate
Church
of
his
native
town
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
ever
see
Manchester
again
?
"
<EOS>
he
sighed
:
"
shall
I
take
Amabel
with
me
there
?
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
If
I
survive
the
plague
,
she
,
I
fear
,
will
never
be
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
Musing
<EOS>
thus
,
he
scanned
the
roof
of
the
cathedral
,
and
noticing
its
stunted
central
tower
,
could
not
help
thinking
how
much
more
striking
its
effects
must
have
been
,
when
the
lofty
spire
it
once
supported
was
standing
.
<EOS>
The
spire
,
it
may
be
remarked
,
was
twice
destroyed
by
lightning
;
first
in
February
,
1444
,
and
subsequently
in
June
,
1561
,
when
it
was
entirely
burnt
down
,
and
never
rebuilt
.
<EOS>
Passing
the
Convocation
House
,
which
then
stood
at
one
side
of
the
southern
transept
,
Leonard
struck
down
Paul
's
Chain
,
and
turning
to
the
right
,
speeded
along
Great
Knightrider
-
street
,
until
he
reached
an
old
habitation
at
the
corner
of
the
passage
leading
to
Doctors
'
Commons
.
 
<EOS>
Knocking
at
the
door
,
an
elderly
servant
presently
appeared
,
and
in
answer
to
his
inquiries
whether
Doctor
Hodges
was
at
home
,
stated
that
he
had
gone
out
,
about
half
an
hour
ago
,
to
attend
Mr.
Fisher
,
a
proctor
,
who
had
been
suddenly
attacked
by
the
plague
at
his
residence
in
Bartholomew
-
close
,
near
Smithfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
on
the
same
errand
,
"
said
Leonard
,
"
and
must
see
your
master
instantly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
choose
to
go
to
Bartholomew
-
close
,
"
replied
the
servant
,
"
you
may
probably
meet
with
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fisher
's
house
is
the
last
but
two
,
on
the
right
,
before
you
come
to
the
area
in
front
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
easily
find
it
,
"
returned
Leonard
,
"
and
will
run
there
as
fast
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
But
if
your
master
should
pass
me
on
the
road
,
beseech
him
to
go
instantly
to
Stephen
Bloundell
's
,
the
grocer
,
in
Wood
-
street
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
servant
assenting
,
Leonard
hastily
retraced
his
steps
,
and
traversing
Blow
-
bladder
-
street
and
Saint
-
Martin's
-
le
-
Grand
,
passed
through
Aldersgate
.
<EOS>
He
then
shaped
his
course
through
the
windings
of
Little
Britain
and
entered
Duck
-
lane
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
in
a
quarter
fearfully
assailed
by
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
houses
had
the
fatal
sign
upon
their
doors
--
a
red
cross
,
of
a
foot
long
,
with
the
piteous
words
above
it
,
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
,
"
in
characters
so
legible
that
they
could
be
easily
distinguished
by
the
moonlight
,
while
a
watchman
,
with
a
halberd
in
his
hand
,
kept
guard
outside
.
 
<EOS>
Involuntarily
drawing
in
his
breath
,
Leonard
quickened
his
pace
.
<EOS>
But
he
met
with
an
unexpected
and
fearful
interruption
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
reached
the
narrow
passage
leading
from
Duck
-
lane
to
Bartholomew
-
close
,
he
heard
the
ringing
of
a
bell
,
followed
by
a
hoarse
voice
,
crying
,
"
Bring
out
your
dead
--
bring
out
your
dead
!
"
<EOS>
he
then
perceived
that
a
large
,
strangely
-
shaped
cart
stopped
up
the
further
end
of
the
passage
,
and
heard
a
window
open
,
and
a
voice
call
out
that
all
was
ready
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
a
light
was
seen
at
the
door
,
and
a
coffin
was
brought
out
and
placed
in
the
cart
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
the
driver
,
who
was
smoking
a
pipe
,
cracked
his
whip
,
and
put
the
vehicle
in
motion
.
 
<EOS>
Shrinking
into
a
doorway
,
and
holding
a
handkerchief
to
his
face
,
to
avoid
breathing
the
pestilential
effluvia
,
Leonard
saw
that
there
were
other
coffins
in
the
cart
,
and
that
it
was
followed
by
two
persons
in
long
black
cloaks
.
<EOS>
The
vehicle
itself
,
fashioned
like
an
open
hearse
,
and
of
the
same
sombre
colour
,
relieved
by
fantastical
designs
,
painted
in
white
,
emblematic
of
the
pestilence
,
was
drawn
by
a
horse
of
the
large
black
Flanders
breed
,
and
decorated
with
funeral
trappings
.
<EOS>
To
Leonard
's
inexpressible
horror
,
the
cart
again
stopped
opposite
him
,
and
the
driver
ringing
his
bell
,
repeated
his
doleful
cry
.
<EOS>
While
another
coffin
was
brought
out
,
and
placed
with
the
rest
,
a
window
in
the
next
house
was
opened
,
and
a
woman
looking
forth
screamed
,
"
Is
Anselm
Chowles
,
the
coffin
-
maker
,
there
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
here
I
am
,
Mother
Malmayns
,
"
replied
one
of
the
men
in
black
cloaks
,
looking
up
as
he
spoke
,
and
exhibiting
features
so
hideous
,
and
stamped
with
such
a
revolting
expression
,
that
Leonard
's
blood
curdled
at
the
sight
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
with
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
carry
away
old
Mike
Norborough
,
"
replied
the
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
,
is
the
old
miser
gone
at
last
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Chowles
,
with
an
atrocious
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
But
how
shall
I
get
paid
for
a
coffin
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
pay
yourself
with
what
you
can
find
in
the
house
,
"
replied
Mother
Malmayns
;
"
or
you
may
carry
him
to
the
grave
without
one
,
if
you
prefer
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
that
wo
n't
do
,
"
returned
Chowles
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
other
customers
to
attend
to
who
_
will
_
pay
;
and
,
besides
,
I
want
to
get
home
.
<EOS>
I
expect
friends
at
supper
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
Mother
Malmayns
.
<EOS>
You
know
where
to
find
me
,
if
you
want
me
.
<EOS>
Move
on
,
Jonas
,
or
<EOS>
you
will
never
reach
Saint
Sepulchre
's
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
woman
angrily
expostulated
with
him
,
and
some
further
parley
ensued,--Leonard
did
not
tarry
to
hear
what
,
but
rushing
past
them
,
gained
Bartholomew
-
close
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
reached
the
proctor
's
house
,
and
found
it
marked
with
the
fatal
cross
.
<EOS>
Addressing
a
watchman
at
the
door
,
he
learnt
,
to
his
great
dismay
,
that
Doctor
Hodges
had
been
gone
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
too
late
,
"
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Fisher
had
breathed
his
last
before
he
arrived
,
and
after
giving
some
directions
to
the
family
as
to
the
precautions
they
ought
to
observe
,
the
doctor
departed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
unfortunate
!
"
exclaimed
Leonard
,
"
I
have
missed
him
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
run
back
to
his
house
instantly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
find
him
at
home
,
"
returned
the
watchman
"
<EOS>
He
is
gone
to
Saint
Paul
's
,
to
attend
a
sick
person
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
Saint
Paul
's
at
this
hour
!
"
cried
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
no
one
is
there
,
except
the
vergers
or
the
sexton
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
gone
to
visit
the
sexton
,
who
is
ill
of
the
plague
,
"
replied
the
watchman
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
you
all
I
know
about
him
.
<EOS>
You
can
do
what
you
think
best
.
"
 
<EOS>
Determined
to
make
another
effort
before
giving
in
,
Leonard
hurried
back
as
fast
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
While
threading
Duck
-
lane
,
he
heard
the
doleful
bell
again
,
and
perceived
the
dead
-
cart
standing
before
a
house
,
from
which
two
small
coffins
were
brought
.
<EOS>
Hurrying
past
the
vehicle
,
he
remarked
that
its
load
was
fearfully
increased
,
but
that
the
coffin
-
maker
and
his
companion
had
left
it
.
<EOS>
Another
minute
had
not
elapsed
before
he
reached
Aldersgate
,
and
passing
through
the
postern
,
he
beheld
a
light
at
the
end
of
Saint
Anne's
-
lane
,
and
heard
the
terrible
voice
of
Solomon
Eagle
,
calling
to
the
sleepers
to
awake
and
repent
.
 
<EOS>
Shutting
his
ears
to
the
cry
,
Leonard
did
not
halt
till
he
reached
the
great
western
door
of
the
cathedral
,
against
which
he
knocked
.
<EOS>
His
first
summons
remaining
unanswered
,
he
repeated
it
,
and
a
wicket
was
then
opened
by
a
grey
-
headed
verger
,
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
,
who
at
first
was
very
angry
at
being
disturbed
;
but
on
learning
whom
the
applicant
was
in
search
of
,
and
that
the
case
was
one
of
urgent
necessity
,
he
admitted
that
the
doctor
was
in
the
cathedral
at
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
Or
rather
,
I
should
say
,
"
he
added
,
"
he
is
in
Saint
Faith
's
.
<EOS>
I
will
conduct
you
to
him
,
if
you
think
proper
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
is
a
good
man,--a
charitable
man
,
"
he
continued
,
"
and
attends
the
poor
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
is
now
with
Matthew
Malmayns
,
the
sexton
,
who
was
taken
ill
of
the
plague
yesterday
,
and
will
get
nothing
but
thanks
--
if
he
gets
those
--
for
his
fee
.
<EOS>
But
,
follow
me
,
young
man
,
follow
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
shut
the
wicket
,
and
led
the
way
along
the
transept
.
<EOS>
The
path
was
uneven
,
many
of
the
flags
having
been
removed
,
and
the
verger
often
paused
to
throw
a
light
upon
the
ground
,
and
warn
his
companion
of
a
hole
.
 
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
the
head
of
the
nave
,
Leonard
cast
his
eyes
down
it
,
and
was
surprised
at
the
magical
effect
of
the
moonlight
upon
its
magnificent
avenue
of
pillars
;
the
massive
shafts
on
the
left
being
completely
illuminated
by
the
silvery
beams
,
while
those
on
the
right
lay
in
deep
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
it
is
a
noble
structure
,
"
replied
the
old
verger
,
noticing
his
look
of
wonder
and
admiration
,
"
and
,
like
many
a
proud
human
being
,
has
known
better
days
.
<EOS>
It
has
seen
sad
changes
in
my
time
,
for
I
recollect
it
when
good
Queen
Bess
ruled
the
land
.
<EOS>
But
come
along
,
young
man,--you
have
something
else
to
think
of
now
.
"
 
<EOS>
Bestowing
a
momentary
glance
upon
the
matchless
choir
,
with
its
groined
roof
,
its
clerestory
windows
,
its
arched
openings
,
its
carved
stalls
,
and
its
gorgeous
rose
-
window
,
Leonard
followed
his
conductor
through
a
small
doorway
on
the
left
of
the
southern
transept
,
and
descending
a
flight
of
stone
steps
,
entered
a
dark
and
extensive
vault
,
for
such
it
seemed
.
<EOS>
The
feeble
light
of
the
lantern
fell
upon
ranks
of
short
heavy
pillars
,
supporting
a
ponderous
arched
roof
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
now
in
Saint
Faith
's
,
"
observed
the
verger
,
"
and
above
you
is
the
choir
of
Saint
Paul
's
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
took
no
notice
of
the
remark
,
but
silently
crossing
the
nave
of
this
beautiful
subterranean
church
(
part
of
which
still
exists
)
,
traversed
its
northern
aisle
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
verger
stopped
before
the
entrance
of
a
small
chapel
,
once
dedicated
to
Saint
John
the
Baptist
,
but
now
devoted
to
a
less
sacred
purpose
.
<EOS>
As
they
advanced
,
Leonard
observed
a
pile
of
dried
skulls
and
bones
in
one
corner
,
a
stone
coffin
,
strips
of
woollen
shrouds
,
fragments
of
coffins
,
mattocks
,
and
spades
.
<EOS>
It
was
evidently
half
a
charnel
,
half
a
receptacle
for
the
sexton
's
tools
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
choose
to
open
that
door
,
"
said
the
verger
,
pointing
to
one
at
the
lower
end
of
the
chamber
,
"
you
will
find
him
you
seek
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
no
further
.
"
 
<EOS>
Summoning
up
all
his
resolution
,
Leonard
pushed
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
A
frightful
scene
met
his
gaze
.
<EOS>
At
one
side
of
a
deep
,
low
-
roofed
vault
,
the
architecture
of
which
was
of
great
antiquity
,
and
showed
that
it
had
been
a
place
of
burial
,
was
stretched
a
miserable
pallet
,
and
upon
it
,
covered
by
a
single
blanket
,
lay
a
wretch
,
whose
groans
and
struggles
proclaimed
the
anguish
he
endured
.
<EOS>
A
lamp
was
burning
on
the
floor
,
and
threw
a
sickly
light
upon
the
agonized
countenance
of
the
sufferer
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
middle
-
aged
man
,
with
features
naturally
harsh
,
but
which
now
,
contracted
by
pain
,
had
assumed
a
revolting
expression
.
<EOS>
An
old
crone
,
who
proved
to
be
his
mother
,
and
a
young
man
,
who
held
him
down
in
bed
by
main
force
,
tended
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
rambling
in
a
frightful
manner
;
and
as
his
ravings
turned
upon
the
most
loathly
matters
,
it
required
some
firmness
to
listen
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
At
a
little
distance
from
him
,
upon
a
bench
,
sat
a
stout
,
shrewd
-
looking
,
but
benevolent
little
personage
,
somewhat
between
forty
and
fifty
.
<EOS>
This
was
Doctor
Hodges
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
lancet
in
his
hand
,
with
which
he
had
just
operated
upon
the
sufferer
,
and
he
was
in
the
act
of
wiping
it
on
a
cloth
.
<EOS>
As
Leonard
entered
the
vault
,
the
doctor
observed
to
the
attendants
of
the
sick
man
,
"
He
will
recover
.
<EOS>
The
tumour
has
discharged
its
venom
.
<EOS>
Keep
him
as
warm
as
you
can
,
and
do
not
let
him
leave
his
bed
for
two
days
.
<EOS>
All
depends
upon
that
.
<EOS>
I
will
send
him
proper
medicines
and
some
blankets
shortly
.
<EOS>
If
he
takes
cold
,
it
will
be
fatal
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
young
man
promised
to
attend
to
the
doctor
's
injunctions
,
and
the
old
woman
mumbled
her
thanks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Judith
Malmayns
?
"
asked
Doctor
Hodges
:
"
I
am
surprised
not
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
Is
she
afraid
of
the
distemper
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Afraid
of
it!--not
she
,
"
replied
the
old
woman
.
"
<EOS>
Since
the
plague
has
raged
so
dreadfully
,
she
has
gone
out
as
a
nurse
to
the
sick
,
and
my
poor
son
has
seen
nothing
of
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
then
recollected
that
he
had
heard
the
woman
,
who
called
out
of
the
miser
's
house
,
addressed
as
Mother
Malmayns
by
the
coffin
-
maker
,
and
had
no
doubt
that
she
was
the
sexton
's
wife
.
<EOS>
His
entrance
having
been
so
noiseless
that
it
passed
unnoticed
,
he
now
stepped
forward
,
and
,
addressing
Doctor
Hodges
,
acquainted
him
with
his
errand
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
exclaimed
the
doctor
,
as
soon
as
he
concluded
,
"
a
son
of
Stephen
Bloundel
,
the
worthy
grocer
of
Wood
-
street
,
attacked
by
the
plague
!
<EOS>
I
will
go
with
you
instantly
,
young
man
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
regard
for
your
master
--
a
very
great
regard
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
better
man
living
.
<EOS>
The
poor
lad
must
be
saved
,
if
possible
.
"
<EOS>
And
hastily
repeating
his
instructions
to
the
attendants
of
the
sick
man
,
he
left
the
vault
with
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
They
found
the
verger
in
the
charnel
,
and
before
quitting
it
,
the
doctor
drew
a
small
flask
of
canary
from
his
pocket
,
and
applied
it
to
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
my
anti
-
pestilential
drink
,
"
he
remarked
with
a
smile
,
"
and
it
has
preserved
me
from
contagion
hitherto
.
<EOS>
You
must
let
us
out
of
the
south
door
,
friend
,
"
he
added
to
the
verger
,
"
for
I
shall
be
obliged
to
step
home
for
a
moment
,
and
it
will
save
time
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
,
young
man
,
and
tell
me
what
has
been
done
for
the
grocer
's
son
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
they
traversed
the
gloomy
aisle
of
Saint
Faith
,
and
mounted
to
the
upper
structure
,
Leonard
related
all
that
had
taken
place
since
poor
Stephen
's
seizure
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
strongly
expressed
his
approval
of
what
had
been
done
,
and
observed
,
"
It
could
not
be
better
.
<EOS>
With
Heaven
's
help
,
I
have
no
doubt
we
shall
save
him
,
and
I
am
truly
glad
of
it
for
his
father
's
sake
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
they
had
reached
the
southern
door
,
and
the
verger
having
unlocked
it
,
they
issued
forth
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
bright
moonlight
,
and
Leonard
,
whose
mind
was
greatly
relieved
by
the
assurances
of
the
physician
,
felt
in
some
degree
reconciled
to
the
delay
,
and
kept
up
his
part
in
the
conversation
promoted
by
his
companion
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
,
who
was
an
extremely
kind
-
hearted
man
,
and
appeared
to
have
a
great
regard
for
the
grocer
,
made
many
inquiries
as
to
his
family
,
and
spoke
in
terms
of
the
highest
admiration
of
the
beauty
of
his
eldest
daughter
.
<EOS>
The
mention
of
Amabel
's
name
,
while
it
made
Leonard
's
cheek
burn
,
rekindled
all
his
jealousy
of
Wyvil
,
and
he
tried
to
make
some
excuse
to
get
away
,
but
his
companion
would
not
hear
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
there
is
no
hurry
,
"
said
the
doctor
;
"
all
is
going
on
as
well
as
possible
.
<EOS>
I
will
make
your
excuses
to
your
master
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
reaching
the
doctor
's
house
they
were
ushered
into
a
large
room
,
surrounded
with
bookshelves
and
cases
of
anatomical
preparations
.
<EOS>
Hodges
seated
himself
at
a
table
,
on
which
a
shaded
lamp
was
placed
,
and
writing
out
a
prescription
,
desired
his
servant
to
get
it
made
up
at
a
neighbouring
apothecary
's
,
and
to
take
it
,
with
a
couple
of
blankets
,
to
the
sexton
of
Saint
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
He
then
produced
a
bottle
of
medicated
canary
,
and
pouring
out
a
large
glass
for
the
apprentice
,
drained
another
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
answer
for
its
virtue
,
"
he
said
:
"
it
is
a
sure
preservative
against
the
plague
.
"
 
<EOS>
Having
furnished
himself
with
several
small
packets
of
simples
,
a
few
pots
of
ointment
,
one
or
two
phials
,
and
a
case
of
surgical
instruments
,
he
told
Leonard
he
was
ready
to
attend
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
go
round
by
Warwick
-
lane
,
"
he
added
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
call
upon
Chowles
,
the
coffin
-
maker
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
detain
us
a
moment
;
and
I
have
an
order
to
give
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
mention
of
this
name
brought
to
Leonard
's
mind
<EOS>
the
hideous
attendant
on
the
dead
-
cart
,
and
he
had
no
doubt
he
was
the
person
in
question
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
become
him
,
however
,
to
make
a
remark
,
and
they
set
out
.
 
<EOS>
Mounting
Addle
-
hill
,
and
threading
Ave
-
Maria
-
lane
,
they
entered
Warwick
-
lane
,
and
about
half
-
way
up
the
latter
thoroughfare
,
the
doctor
stopped
before
a
shop
,
bearing
on
its
immense
projecting
sign
the
representation
of
a
coffin
lying
in
state
,
and
covered
with
scutcheons
,
underneath
which
was
written
,
"
ANSELM
CHOWLES
,
COFFIN
-
MAKER
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
you
will
find
Mr.
Chowles
at
home
,
"
observed
Leonard
:
"
<EOS>
for
I
saw
him
with
the
dead
-
cart
not
half
an
hour
ago
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
,
"
returned
the
doctor
;
"
but
I
shall
see
one
of
his
men
.
<EOS>
The
coffin
-
maker
's
business
is
now
carried
on
in
the
night
time
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
sigh
;
"
and
he
drives
a
flourishing
trade
.
<EOS>
These
sad
times
will
make
his
fortune
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
rapped
with
his
cane
at
the
door
,
which
,
after
a
little
delay
,
was
opened
by
a
young
man
in
a
carpenter
's
dress
,
with
a
hammer
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
who
it
was
,
this
person
exhibited
great
confusion
,
and
would
have
retired
;
but
the
doctor
,
pushing
him
aside
,
asked
for
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
see
him
just
now
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
other
,
evidently
considerably
embarrassed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
just
come
home
greatly
fatigued
,
and
is
about
to
retire
to
rest
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
matter
,
"
returned
the
doctor
,
entering
a
room
,
in
which
three
or
four
other
men
were
at
work
,
hastily
finishing
coffins
;
"
I
_
must
_
see
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
No
further
opposition
being
offered
,
Hodges
,
followed
by
the
apprentice
,
marched
towards
an
inner
room
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
reached
the
door
,
a
burst
of
loud
laughter
,
evidently
proceeding
from
a
numerous
party
,
arose
from
within
,
and
a
harsh
voice
was
heard
chanting
the
following
strains
:
   
SONG
OF
THE
PLAGUE
.
  
<EOS>
To
others
the
Plague
a
foe
may
be
,
  
To
me
'
tis
<EOS>
a
friend
--
not
an
enemy
;
  
My
coffins
and
coffers
alike
it
fills
,
  
And
the
richer
I
grow
the
more
it
kills
.
  
<EOS>
_
Drink
the
Plague
!
<EOS>
Drink
the
Plague
!
<EOS>
_
   
<EOS>
For
months
,
for
years
,
may
it
spend
its
rage
  
On
lusty
manhood
and
trembling
age
;
  
Though
half
mankind
of
the
scourge
should
die
,
  
<EOS>
My
coffins
will
sell
--

_
 
Loud
acclamations
followed
the
song
,
and
the
doctor
,
who
was
filled
with
disgust
and
astonishment
,
opened
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
absolutely
recoiled
at
the
scene
presented
to
his
gaze
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
a
large
room
,
the
sides
of
which
were
crowded
with
coffins
,
piled
to
the
very
ceiling
,
sat
about
a
dozen
personages
,
with
pipes
in
their
mouths
,
and
flasks
and
glasses
before
them
.
<EOS>
Their
seats
were
coffins
,
and
their
table
was
a
coffin
set
upon
a
bier
.
<EOS>
Perched
on
a
pyramid
of
coffins
,
gradually
diminishing
in
size
as
the
pile
approached
its
apex
,
Chowles
was
waving
a
glass
in
one
hand
,
and
a
bottle
in
the
other
,
when
the
doctor
made
his
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
A
more
hideous
personage
can
not
be
imagined
than
the
coffin
-
maker
.
<EOS>
He
was
clothed
in
a
suit
of
rusty
black
,
which
made
his
skeleton
limbs
look
yet
more
lean
and
cadaverous
.
<EOS>
His
head
was
perfectly
bald
,
and
its
yellow
skin
,
divested
of
any
artificial
covering
,
glistened
like
polished
ivory
.
<EOS>
His
throat
was
long
and
scraggy
,
and
supported
a
head
unrivalled
for
ugliness
.
<EOS>
His
nose
had
been
broken
in
his
youth
,
and
was
almost
compressed
flat
with
his
face
.
<EOS>
His
few
remaining
teeth
were
yellow
and
discoloured
with
large
gaps
between
them
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
bright
,
and
set
in
deep
cavernous
recesses
,
and
,
now
that
he
was
more
than
half
-
intoxicated
,
gleamed
with
unnatural
lustre
.
<EOS>
The
friends
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
were
congenial
spirits,--searchers
,
watchmen
,
buriers
,
apothecaries
,
and
other
wretches
,
who
,
like
himself
,
rejoiced
in
the
pestilence
,
because
it
was
a
source
of
profit
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
corner
of
the
room
,
with
a
part
-
emptied
glass
before
her
,
and
several
articles
in
her
lap
,
which
she
hastily
pocketed
on
the
entrance
of
the
doctor
,
sat
the
plague
-
nurse
,
Mother
Malmayns
;
and
Leonard
thought
her
,
if
possible
,
more
villainous
-
looking
than
her
companions
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
rough
,
raw
-
boned
woman
,
with
sandy
hair
and
light
brows
,
a
sallow
,
freckled
complexion
,
a
nose
with
wide
nostrils
,
and
a
large
,
thick
-
lipped
mouth
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
moreover
,
a
look
of
mingled
cunning
and
ferocity
inexpressibly
revolting
.
 
<EOS>
Sharply
rebuking
Chowles
,
who
,
in
springing
from
his
lofty
seat
,
upset
several
of
the
topmost
coffins
,
the
doctor
gave
him
some
directions
,
and
,
turning
to
the
nurse
,
informed
her
of
her
husband
's
condition
,
and
ordered
her
to
go
to
him
immediately
<EOS>
Mother
Malmayns
arose
,
and
glancing
significantly
at
the
coffin
-
maker
,
took
her
departure
.
 
<EOS>
Repeating
his
injunctions
to
Chowles
in
a
severe
tone
,
the
doctor
followed
;
and
seeing
her
take
the
way
towards
Saint
Paul
's
,
proceeded
at
a
brisk
pace
along
Paternoster
-
row
with
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
they
reached
Wood
-
street
,
and
knocking
at
the
door
,
were
admitted
by
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
be
praised
,
you
are
come
at
last
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
porter
.
<EOS>
"
Our
master
began
to
think
something
had
happened
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
my
fault
,
"
returned
Doctor
Hodges
;
"
but
how
is
the
young
man
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Better
,
much
better
,
as
I
understand
,
"
replied
Blaize
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
not
seen
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
that
's
well
,
"
rejoined
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lead
me
to
his
room
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Leonard
will
show
you
the
way
,
"
returned
the
porter
,
holding
back
.
 
<EOS>
Glancing
angrily
at
Blaize
,
the
apprentice
conducted
the
doctor
to
the
inner
room
,
where
they
found
the
grocer
,
with
the
Bible
on
his
knee
,
watching
by
the
bedside
of
his
son
.
<EOS>
He
was
delighted
with
their
appearance
,
but
looked
inquisitively
at
his
apprentice
for
some
explanation
of
his
long
absence
.
<EOS>
This
Hodges
immediately
gave
;
and
,
having
examined
the
sufferer
,
he
relieved
the
anxious
father
by
declaring
,
that
,
with
due
care
,
he
had
little
doubt
of
his
son
's
recovery
.
 
<EOS>
"
God
be
praised
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Bloundel
,
falling
on
his
knees
.
 
<EOS>
Hodges
then
gave
minute
directions
to
the
grocer
as
to
how
he
was
to
proceed
,
and
told
him
it
would
be
necessary
for
some
time
to
keep
his
family
separate
.
<EOS>
To
this
Bloundel
readily
agreed
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
's
next
inquiries
were
,
whether
notice
had
been
given
to
the
Examiner
of
Health
,
and
the
grocer
referring
to
Leonard
,
the
latter
acknowledged
that
he
had
forgotten
it
,
but
undertook
to
repair
his
omission
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
he
quitted
the
room
,
and
was
hastening
towards
the
shop
,
when
he
observed
a
figure
on
the
back
stairs
.
<EOS>
Quickly
mounting
them
,
he
overtook
on
the
landing
Maurice
Wyvil
.

<EOS>
THE
GAMESTER
AND
THE
BULLY
.
 
<EOS>
Before
proceeding
further
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
retrace
our
steps
for
a
short
time
,
and
see
what
was
done
by
Maurice
Wyvil
after
the
alarming
announcement
made
to
him
by
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
Of
a
selfish
nature
and
ungovernable
temper
,
and
seeking
only
in
the
pursuit
of
the
grocer
's
daughter
the
gratification
of
his
lawless
desires
,
he
was
filled
,
in
the
first
instance
,
with
furious
disappointment
at
being
robbed
of
the
prize
,
at
the
very
moment
he
expected
it
to
fall
into
his
hands
.
<EOS>
But
this
feeling
was
quickly
effaced
by
anxiety
respecting
his
mistress
,
whose
charms
,
now
that
there
was
every
probability
of
losing
her
(
for
Leonard
's
insinuation
had
led
him
to
believe
she
was
assailed
by
the
pestilence
)
,
appeared
doubly
attractive
to
him
;
and
scarcely
under
the
governance
of
reason
,
he
hurried
towards
Wood
-
street
,
resolved
to
force
his
way
into
the
house
,
and
see
her
again
,
at
all
hazards
.
<EOS>
His
wild
design
,
however
,
was
fortunately
prevented
.
<EOS>
As
he
passed
the
end
of
the
court
leading
to
the
ancient
inn
(
for
it
was
ancient
even
at
the
time
of
this
history
)
,
the
Swan
-
with
-
two
-
Necks
,
in
Lad
-
lane
,
a
young
man
,
as
richly
attired
as
himself
,
and
about
his
own
age
,
who
had
seen
him
approaching
,
suddenly
darted
from
it
,
and
grasping
his
cloak
,
detained
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
must
be
you
,
Wyvil
,
"
cried
this
person
.
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
running
so
quickly
?
<EOS>
I
see
neither
angry
father
,
nor
jealous
apprentice
,
at
your
heels
.
<EOS>
What
has
become
of
the
girl
?
<EOS>
Are
you
tired
of
her
already
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
,
Lydyard
,
"
returned
Wyvil
,
trying
to
extricate
himself
from
his
companion
's
hold
,
who
was
no
other
than
the
gallant
that
had
accompanied
him
on
his
first
visit
to
the
grocer
's
shop
,
and
had
played
his
part
so
adroitly
in
the
scheme
devised
between
them
to
procure
an
interview
with
Amabel,--"let
me
go
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
I
am
in
no
mood
for
jesting
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
the
plague
is
the
matter
?
"
rejoined
Lydyard
.
"
<EOS>
Has
your
mistress
played
you
false
?
<EOS>
Have
you
lost
your
wager
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
plague
_
is
_
the
matter
,
"
replied
Wyvil
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
Amabel
is
attacked
by
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
see
her
instantly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
devil
!
"
exclaimed
Lydyard
.
<EOS>
"
Here
is
a
pretty
termination
to
the
affair
.
<EOS>
But
if
this
is
really
the
case
,
you
must
_
not
_
see
her
.
<EOS>
It
is
one
thing
to
be
run
through
the
arm,--which
<EOS>
you
must
own
I
managed
as
dexterously
as
<EOS>
the
best
master
of
fence
could
have
<EOS>
done,--and
lose
a
few
drops
of
blood
for
a
mistress
,
but
it
is
another
to
brave
the
plague
on
her
account
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
care
for
nothing
,
"
replied
Wyvil
;
"
I
_
will
_
see
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
madness
!
"
<EOS>
remonstrated
Lydyard
,
still
maintaining
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
"
What
satisfaction
will
it
afford
you
to
witness
her
sufferings
--
to
see
the
frightful
ravages
made
upon
her
charms
by
this
remorseless
disease,--to
throw
her
whole
family
into
consternation
,
and
destroy
the
little
chance
she
may
have
of
recovery
,
by
your
presence
?
<EOS>
What
good
will
this
do
?
<EOS>
No,--you
must
pay
your
wager
to
Sedley
,
and
forget
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
forget
her
,
"
replied
Wyvil
.
<EOS>
"
My
feelings
have
undergone
a
total
change
.
<EOS>
If
I
_
am
_
capable
of
real
love
,
it
is
for
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Real
love
!
"
exclaimed
Lydyard
,
in
an
incredulous
tone
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
subject
were
not
too
serious
,
I
should
laugh
in
your
face
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
you
would
marry
her
,
and
abandon
your
design
upon
the
rich
heiress
,
pretty
Mistress
Mallet
,
whom
old
Rowley
recommended
to
your
attention
,
and
whom
the
fair
Stewart
has
more
than
half
-
won
for
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
,
"
replied
the
other
,
energetically
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
then
,
you
are
more
insane
than
I
thought
you
,
"
rejoined
Lydyard
,
relinquishing
his
hold
;
"
and
the
sooner
you
take
the
plague
the
better
.
<EOS>
It
may
cure
your
present
brain
fever
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
back
to
Parravicin
,
and
the
others
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
require
my
assistance
further
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
,
"
replied
Wyvil
,
distractedly
;
"
I
have
not
yet
given
up
my
intention
of
carrying
off
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
carry
her
oft
in
this
state
,
"
rejoined
the
other
,
"
it
must
be
to
the
pest
-
house
.
<EOS>
But
who
told
you
she
was
attacked
by
the
plague
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Her
father
's
apprentice
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Wyvil
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
believed
him
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Lydyard
,
with
a
derisive
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Undoubtedly
,
"
replied
Wyvil
.
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
it
is
evidently
a
mere
trick
to
frighten
you
from
the
house
,
"
rejoined
Lydyard
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
surprised
so
shallow
a
device
should
succeed
with
_
you
_
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
persuade
myself
it
was
a
trick
,
"
returned
Wyvil
.
<EOS>
"
But
the
fellow
's
manner
convinced
me
he
was
in
earnest
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
will
not
dispute
the
point
,
though
I
am
sure
I
am
right
,
"
returned
Lydyard
.
<EOS>
"
But
be
not
too
precipitate
.
<EOS>
Since
the
apprentice
has
seen
you
,
some
alteration
may
be
necessary
in
your
plans
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
can
make
no
difference
.
"
 
<EOS>
Wyvil
suffered
himself
to
be
led
up
the
court
,
and
passing
through
a
door
on
the
left
,
they
entered
a
spacious
room
,
across
which
ran
a
long
table
,
furnished
at
one
end
with
wine
and
refreshments
,
and
at
the
other
with
cards
and
dice
.
 
<EOS>
Three
persons
were
seated
at
the
table
,
the
most
noticeable
of
whom
was
a
dissipated
-
looking
young
man
,
dressed
in
the
extremity
of
the
prevailing
mode
,
with
ruffles
of
the
finest
colbertine
,
three
inches
in
depth
,
at
his
wrists
;
<EOS>
a
richly
-
laced
cravat
round
his
throat
;
white
silk
hose
,
adorned
with
gold
clocks
;
velvet
shoes
of
the
same
colour
as
the
hose
,
fastened
with
immense
roses
;
a
silver
-
hilted
sword
,
supported
by
a
broad
embroidered
silk
band
;
and
a
cloak
and
doublet
of
carnation
-
coloured
velvet
,
woven
with
gold
,
and
decorated
with
innumerable
glittering
points
and
ribands
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
flowing
wig
of
flaxen
hair
,
and
a
broad
-
leaved
hat
,
looped
with
a
diamond
buckle
,
and
placed
negligently
on
the
left
side
of
his
head
.
<EOS>
His
figure
was
slight
,
but
extremely
well
formed
;
and
his
features
might
have
been
termed
handsome
,
but
for
their
reckless
and
licentious
expression
.
<EOS>
He
was
addressed
by
his
companions
as
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
.
 
<EOS>
The
person
opposite
to
him
,
whose
name
was
Disbrowe
,
and
who
was
likewise
a
very
handsome
young
man
,
though
his
features
were
flushed
and
disturbed
,
partly
by
the
wine
he
had
drunk
,
and
partly
by
his
losses
at
play
,
was
equipped
in
the
splendid
accoutrements
of
a
captain
in
the
king
's
body
-
guard
.
<EOS>
His
left
hand
convulsively
clutched
an
empty
purse
,
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
a
large
sum
of
money
,
which
he
had
just
handed
over
to
the
knight
,
and
which
the
latter
was
carelessly
transferring
to
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
The
last
of
the
three
,
whose
looks
betrayed
his
character
--
that
of
a
sharper
and
a
bully
--
called
himself
Major
Pillichody
,
his
pretensions
to
military
rank
being
grounded
upon
his
service
<EOS>
(
so
ran
his
own
statement
,
though
it
was
never
clearly
substantiated
)
in
the
king
's
army
during
the
civil
wars
.
<EOS>
Major
Pillichody
was
a
man
of
remarkably
fierce
exterior
.
<EOS>
Seamed
with
many
scars
,
and
destitute
of
the
left
eye
,
the
orifice
of
which
was
covered
,
with
a
huge
black
patch
;
his
face
was
of
a
deep
mulberry
colour
,
clearly
attesting
his
devotion
to
the
bottle
;
while
his
nose
,
which
was
none
of
the
smallest
,
was
covered
with
"
bubukles
,
and
whelks
,
and
knobs
,
and
flames
of
fire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
was
of
the
middle
size
,
stoutly
built
,
and
given
to
corpulency
,
though
not
so
much
so
as
to
impair
his
activity
.
<EOS>
His
attire
consisted
of
a
cloak
and
doublet
of
scarlet
cloth
,
very
much
stained
and
tarnished
,
and
edged
with
gold
lace
,
likewise
the
worse
for
wear
;
jack
-
boots
,
with
huge
funnel
tops
;
spurs
,
with
enormous
rowels
,
and
a
rapier
of
preposterous
length
.
<EOS>
He
wore
his
own
hair
,
which
was
swart
and
woolly
,
like
that
of
a
negro
;
and
had
beard
and
moustaches
to
match
.
<EOS>
His
hat
was
fiercely
cocked
;
his
gestures
swaggering
and
insolent
;
and
he
was
perpetually
racking
his
brain
to
invent
new
and
extra
-
ordinary
oaths
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
soon
returned
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Parravicin
,
as
Wyvil
appeared
.
<EOS>
"
Accept
my
congratulations
?
"
 
"
And
mine
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
We
wild
fellows
have
but
to
be
seen
to
conquer
.
<EOS>
Sugar
and
spice
,
and
all
that
's
nice
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
smacking
his
lips
,
as
he
filled
a
glass
from
a
long
-
necked
bottle
on
the
table
;
"
May
the
grocer
's
daughter
prove
sweeter
than
her
father
's
plums
,
and
more
melting
than
his
butter
!
<EOS>
Is
she
without
?
<EOS>
Are
we
to
see
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
Wyvil
made
no
answer
,
but
,
walking
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
threw
himself
into
a
chair
,
and
,
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
,
appeared
wrapped
in
thought
.
<EOS>
Lydyard
took
a
seat
beside
him
,
and
endeavoured
to
engage
him
in
conversation
;
but
,
finding
his
efforts
fruitless
,
he
desisted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Something
is
wrong
,
"
observed
Parravicin
,
to
the
major
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
been
foiled
in
his
attempt
to
carry
off
the
girl
.
<EOS>
Sedley
has
won
his
wager
,
and
it
is
a
heavy
sum
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
resume
our
play
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
to
Disbrowe
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
more
to
lose
,
"
observed
the
young
man
,
filling
a
large
goblet
to
the
brim
,
and
emptying
it
at
a
draught
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
master
of
every
farthing
I
possess
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hum
!
"
exclaimed
Parravicin
,
taking
up
a
pack
of
cards
,
and
snapping
them
between
his
finger
and
thumb
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
married
,
Captain
Disbrowe
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
if
I
am
?
"
cried
the
young
man
,
becoming
suddenly
pale
;
"
what
if
I
am
?
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
told
your
wife
is
beautiful
,
"
replied
Parravicin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Beautiful
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Pillichody
;
"
by
the
well
-
filled
coffers
of
the
widow
of
Watling
-
street
!
<EOS>
she
is
an
angel
.
<EOS>
Beautiful
is
not
the
word
:
Mrs.
Disbrowe
is
divine
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
never
seen
her
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha!--fire
and
fury
!
<EOS>
my
word
doubted
,
"
cried
the
major
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
her
at
the
play
-
houses
,
at
the
Mulberry
-
garden
,
at
court
,
and
at
church
.
<EOS>
Not
seen
her
!
<EOS>
By
the
one
eye
of
a
Cyclops
,
but
I
have
!
<EOS>
You
shall
hear
my
description
of
her
,
and
judge
of
its
correctness
.
<EOS>
_
Imprimis
_
,
she
has
a
tall
and
majestic
figure
,
and
might
be
a
queen
for
her
dignity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
"
said
Disbrowe
,
by
no
means
displeased
with
the
commencement
.
 
<EOS>
"
Secondly
,
"
pursued
Pillichody
,
"
she
has
a
clear
olive
complexion
,
bright
black
eyes
,
hair
and
brows
to
match
,
a
small
foot
,
a
pretty
turn
-
up
nose
,
a
dimpling
cheek
,
a
mole
upon
her
throat
,
the
rosiest
lips
imaginable
,
an
alluring
look--
"
 
"
No
more
,
"
interrupted
Disbrowe
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
plain
you
have
never
seen
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Unbelieving
pagan
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
major
,
clapping
his
hand
furiously
upon
his
sword
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
more
--
I
have
spoken
with
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
lie
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Disbrowe
,
hurling
a
dice
-
box
at
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
roared
Pillichody
,
in
a
voice
of
thunder
,
and
pushing
back
his
chair
till
it
was
stopped
by
the
wall
.
"
Death
and
fiends
!
<EOS>
I
will
make
mincemeat
of
your
heart
,
and
send
it
as
a
love
-
offering
to
your
wife
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
whipping
out
his
long
rapier
,
he
would
have
assaulted
Disbrowe
,
if
Sir
Paul
had
not
interposed
,
and
commanded
him
authoritatively
to
put
up
his
blade
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
your
revenge
in
a
safer
way
,
"
he
whispered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
Paul
,
"
rejoined
the
bully
,
with
affected
reluctance
,
"
as
you
desire
it
,
I
will
spare
the
young
man
's
life
.
<EOS>
I
must
wash
away
the
insult
in
burgundy
,
since
I
can
not
do
so
in
blood
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
emptied
the
flask
next
him
,
and
called
to
a
drawer
,
who
was
in
attendance
,
in
an
imperious
tone
,
to
bring
two
more
bottles
.
 
<EOS>
Parravicin
,
meanwhile
,
picked
up
the
dice
-
box
,
and
,
seating
himself
,
spread
a
large
heap
of
gold
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
mentioned
your
wife
,
Captain
Disbrowe
,
"
he
said
,
addressing
the
young
officer
,
who
anxiously
watched
his
movements
,
"
not
with
any
intention
of
giving
you
offence
,
but
to
show
you
that
,
although
you
have
lost
your
money
,
you
have
still
a
valuable
stake
left
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
you
,
Sir
Paul
,
"
returned
Disbrowe
,
with
a
look
of
indignant
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
plain
<EOS>
,
then
,
"
replied
Parravicin
,
"
I
have
won
from
you
two
hundred
pounds
--
all
you
possess
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
ruined
man
,
and
,
as
such
,
will
run
any
hazard
to
retrieve
your
losses
.
<EOS>
I
give
you
a
last
chance
.
<EOS>
I
will
stake
all
my
winnings
,
nay
,
double
the
amount
,
against
your
wife
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
key
of
the
house
you
inhabit
,
by
which
you
admit
yourself
at
all
hours
;
so
at
least
the
major
informs
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
win
,
that
key
shall
be
mine
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
my
chance
for
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
me
now
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
the
young
man
,
with
concentrated
fury
.
<EOS>
"
I
understand
that
you
are
a
villain
.
<EOS>
You
have
robbed
me
of
my
money
,
and
would
rob
me
of
my
honour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
These
are
harsh
words
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
knight
,
calmly
;
"
but
let
them
pass
.
<EOS>
We
will
play
first
,
and
fight
afterwards
.
<EOS>
But
you
refuse
my
challenge
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
false
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Disbrowe
,
fiercely
<EOS>
,
"
I
accept
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
producing
a
key
,
he
threw
it
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
My
life
is
,
in
truth
,
set
on
the
die
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
desperate
look--"for
if
I
lose
,
I
will
not
survive
my
shame
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
forget
our
terms
,
"
observed
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
to
be
your
representative
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
You
can
return
home
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Throw
,
sir
--
throw
,
"
cried
the
young
man
,
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pardon
,
me
,
"
replied
the
knight
;
"
the
first
cast
is
with
you
.
<EOS>
A
single
main
decides
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
it
so
,
"
returned
Disbrowe
,
seizing
the
box
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
shook
the
dice
with
a
frenzied
air
,
the
major
and
Lydyard
drew
near
the
table
,
and
even
Wyvil
roused
himself
to
watch
the
result
.
 
<EOS>
"
Twelve
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Disbrowe
,
as
he
removed
the
box
.
<EOS>
"
My
honour
is
saved
!
<EOS>
My
fortune
retrieved
--
Huzza
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
fast
,
"
returned
Parravicin
,
shaking
the
box
in
his
turn
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
a
little
too
hasty
,
"
he
added
,
uncovering
the
dice
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
twelve
,
too
.
<EOS>
We
must
throw
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
to
decide
,
"
cried
the
young
officer
,
again
rattling
the
dice
.
<EOS>
"
Six
!
"
 
<EOS>
Parravicin
smiled
,
took
the
box
,
and
threw
ten
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perdition
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Disbrowe
,
striking
his
brow
with
his
clenched
hand
.
<EOS>
"
What
devil
tempted
me
to
my
undoing?--My
wife
trusted
to
this
profligate
!
<EOS>
Horror!--it
must
not
be
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
late
to
retract
,
"
replied
Parravicin
,
taking
up
the
key
,
and
turning
with
a
triumphant
look
to
his
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Disbrowe
noticed
the
smile
,
and
stung
beyond
endurance
,
drew
his
sword
,
and
called
to
the
knight
to
defend
himself
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
,
passes
were
exchanged
.
<EOS>
But
the
conflict
was
brief
.
<EOS>
Fortune
,
as
before
,
declared
herself
in
favour
of
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
He
disarmed
his
assailant
,
who
rushed
out
of
the
room
,
uttering
the
wildest
ejaculations
of
rage
and
despair
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
you
should
have
your
revenge
,
"
observed
the
knight
to
Pillichody
,
as
soon
as
Disbrowe
was
gone
.
"
<EOS>
Is
his
wife
really
as
beautiful
as
you
represent
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Words
are
too
feeble
to
paint
her
charms
,
"
replied
the
major
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shafts
of
Cupid
!
<EOS>
she
must
be
seen
to
be
appreciated
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
"
returned
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
made
a
bad
night
's
work
of
it
,
so
far
.
<EOS>
I'faith
,
Wyvil
,
I
pity
you
.
<EOS>
To
lose
a
heavy
wager
is
provoking
enough
--
but
to
lose
a
pretty
mistress
is
the
devil
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
lost
neither
yet
,
"
replied
Wyvil
,
who
had
completely
recovered
his
spirits
,
and
joined
in
the
general
merriment
occasioned
by
the
foregoing
occurrence
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
baffled
,
not
defeated
.
<EOS>
What
say
you
to
an
exchange
of
mistresses
?
<EOS>
I
am
so
diverted
with
your
adventure
,
that
I
am
half
inclined
to
give
you
the
grocer
's
daughter
for
Disbrowe
's
wife
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
superb
creature
--
languid
as
a
Circassian
,
and
passionate
as
an
Andalusian
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
agree
to
the
exchange
,
especially
after
your
rapturous
description
,
"
returned
Parravicin
,
"
but
I
'll
stake
Mrs.
Disbrowe
against
Amabel
.
<EOS>
The
winner
shall
have
both
.
<EOS>
A
single
cast
shall
decide
,
as
before
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Wyvil
,
"
I
could
not
resign
Amabel
,
if
I
lost
.
<EOS>
And
the
luck
is
all
on
your
side
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
you
please
,
"
rejoined
the
knight
,
sweeping
the
glittering
pile
into
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
Drawer
,
another
bottle
of
burgundy
.
<EOS>
A
health
to
our
mistresses
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
quaffing
a
brimmer
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
health
to
the
grocer
's
daughter
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wyvil
,
with
difficulty
repressing
a
shudder
,
as
he
uttered
the
pledge
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
health
to
the
rich
widow
of
Watling
-
street
,
"
cried
Pillichody
,
draining
a
bumper
,
"
and
may
I
soon
call
her
mine
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
mistress
to
toast
,
"
said
Lydyard
;
"
and
I
have
drunk
wine
enough
.
<EOS>
Do
not
forget
,
gentlemen
,
that
the
plague
is
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
death's
-
head
at
the
feast
,
Lydyard
,
"
rejoined
Parravicin
,
setting
down
his
glass
.
<EOS>
"
I
hate
the
idea
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
It
poisons
all
our
pleasures
.
<EOS>
We
must
meet
at
noon
to
-
morrow
,
at
the
Smyrna
,
to
compare
notes
as
to
our
successes
.
<EOS>
Before
we
separate
,
can
I
be
of
any
further
service
to
you
,
Wyvil
?
<EOS>
I
came
here
to
enjoy
_
your
_
triumph
;
but
,
egad
,
I
have
found
so
admirable
a
bubble
in
that
hot
-
headed
Disbrowe
,
whom
I
met
at
the
Smyrna
,
and
brought
here
to
while
away
the
time
,
that
I
must
demand
your
congratulations
upon
_
mine
_
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
certainly
achieved
an
easy
victory
over
the
husband
,
"
returned
Wyvil
;
"
and
I
trust
your
success
with
the
wife
will
be
commensurate
.
<EOS>
I
require
no
further
assistance
.
<EOS>
What
I
have
to
do
must
be
done
alone
.
<EOS>
Lydyard
will
accompany
me
to
the
house
,
and
then
I
must
shift
for
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
we
will
all
see
you
safe
inside
,
"
returned
Parravicin
,
"
We
shall
pass
by
the
grocer
's
shop
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
well
,
having
passed
it
a
hundred
times
,
in
the
vain
hope
of
catching
a
glimpse
of
its
lovely
inmate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
it
_
was
_
a
vain
hope
,
"
replied
Wyvil
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
scale
a
wall
to
surprise
the
garrison
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
you
will
need
the
rope
-
ladder
,
"
replied
Lydyard
;
"
it
is
in
readiness
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
carry
it
,
"
said
Pillichody
,
picking
up
the
ladder
which
was
lying
in
a
corner
of
the
room
,
and
throwing
it
over
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
"
Bombs
and
batteries
!
<EOS>
I
like
to
be
an
escalader
when
the
forts
of
love
are
stormed
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
party
then
set
out
.
<EOS>
As
they
proceeded
,
Parravicin
ascertained
from
the
major
that
Disbrowe
's
house
was
situated
in
a
small
street
leading
out
of
Piccadilly
,
but
as
he
could
not
be
quite
sure
that
he
understood
his
informant
aright
,
he
engaged
him
to
accompany
him
and
point
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
they
had
reached
Wood
-
street
,
and
keeping
in
the
shade
,
reconnoitred
the
house
.
<EOS>
But
though
Wyvil
clapped
his
hands
,
blew
a
shrill
whistle
,
and
made
other
signals
,
no
answer
was
returned
,
nor
was
a
light
seen
at
any
of
the
upper
windows
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
all
was
still
and
silent
as
death
.
 
<EOS>
The
grocer
's
was
a
large
,
old
-
fashioned
house
,
built
about
the
middle
of
the
preceding
century
,
or
perhaps
earlier
,
and
had
four
stories
,
each
projecting
over
the
other
,
till
the
pile
seemed
completely
to
overhang
the
street
.
<EOS>
The
entire
front
,
except
the
upper
story
,
which
was
protected
by
oaken
planks
,
was
covered
with
panels
of
the
same
timber
,
and
the
projections
were
supported
by
heavy
beams
,
embellished
with
grotesque
carvings
.
<EOS>
Three
deeply
-
embayed
windows
,
having
stout
wooden
bars
,
filled
with
minute
diamond
panes
,
set
in
leaden
frames
,
were
allotted
to
each
floor
;
while
the
like
number
of
gables
,
ornamented
with
curiously
-
carved
coignes
,
and
long
-
moulded
leaden
spouts
,
shooting
far
into
the
street
,
finished
the
roof
.
<EOS>
A
huge
sign
,
with
the
device
of
Noah
's
Ark
,
and
the
owner
's
name
upon
it
,
hung
before
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
After
carefully
examining
the
house
,
peeping
through
the
chinks
in
the
lower
shutters
,
and
discovering
the
grocer
seated
by
the
bedside
of
his
son
,
though
he
could
not
make
out
the
object
of
his
solicitude
,
Wyvil
decided
upon
attempting
an
entrance
by
the
backyard
.
<EOS>
To
reach
it
,
a
court
and
a
narrow
alley
,
leading
to
an
open
space
surrounded
by
high
walls
,
had
to
be
traversed
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
this
spot
,
Wyvil
threw
one
end
of
the
rope
ladder
over
the
wall
,
which
was
about
twelve
feet
high
,
and
speedily
succeeding
in
securing
it
,
mounted
,
and
drawing
it
up
after
him
,
waved
his
hand
to
his
companions
,
and
disappeared
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
After
waiting
for
a
moment
to
listen
,
and
hearing
a
window
open
,
they
concluded
he
had
gained
admittance
,
and
turned
to
depart
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
for
Mrs.
Disbrowe
!
"
cried
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
find
a
coach
or
a
chair
in
Cheapside
.
<EOS>
Can
I
take
you
westward
,
Lydyard
?
"
 
<EOS>
But
the
other
declined
the
offer
,
saying
,
"
I
will
not
desert
Wyvil
.
<EOS>
I
feel
certain
he
will
get
into
some
scrape
,
and
may
need
me
to
help
him
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
Take
care
of
yourself
,
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
Beware
of
the
plague
,
and
of
what
is
worse
than
the
plague
,
an
injured
husband
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
major
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
sir
,
"
returned
Pillichody
,
raising
his
hat
.
"
<EOS>
A
merry
watching
,
and
a
good
catching
,
as
the
sentinels
were
wo
nt
to
say
,
when
I
served
King
Charles
the
First
.
<EOS>
Sir
Paul
,
I
attend
you

THE
INTERVIEW
.
 
<EOS>
Maurice
Wyvil
,
as
his
friends
conjectured
,
had
found
his
way
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
Creeping
through
the
window
,
and
entering
a
passage
,
he
moved
noiselessly
along
till
he
reached
the
head
of
the
kitchen
stairs
,
where
,
hearing
voices
below
,
and
listening
to
what
was
said
,
he
soon
ascertained
from
the
discourse
of
the
speakers
,
who
were
no
other
than
old
Josyna
and
Patience
,
that
it
was
not
the
grocer
's
daughter
,
but
one
of
his
sons
,
who
was
attacked
by
the
plague
,
and
that
Amabel
was
in
perfect
health
,
though
confined
in
her
mother
's
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
Overjoyed
at
the
information
he
had
thus
acquired
,
he
retired
as
noiselessly
as
he
came
,
and
after
searching
about
for
a
short
time
,
discovered
the
main
staircase
,
and
ascended
it
on
the
points
of
his
feet
.
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
,
however
,
mounted
a
dozen
steps
,
when
a
door
opened
,
and
Blaize
crawled
along
the
passage
,
groaning
to
himself
,
and
keeping
his
eyes
bent
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Seeing
he
was
unnoticed
,
Wyvil
gained
the
landing
,
and
treading
softly
,
placed
his
ear
at
every
door
,
until
at
last
the
musical
accents
of
Amabel
convinced
him
he
had
hit
upon
the
right
one
.
 
<EOS>
His
heart
beat
so
violently
that
,
for
a
few
seconds
,
he
was
unable
to
move
.
<EOS>
Becoming
calmer
,
he
tried
the
door
,
and
finding
it
locked
,
rapped
with
his
knuckles
against
it
.
<EOS>
The
grocer
's
wife
demanded
who
was
there
.
<EOS>
But
Wyvil
,
instead
of
returning
an
answer
,
repeated
his
application
.
<EOS>
The
same
demand
followed
,
and
in
a
louder
key
.
<EOS>
Still
no
answer
.
<EOS>
A
third
summons
,
however
,
so
alarmed
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
that
,
forgetful
of
her
husband
's
injunctions
,
she
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
;
but
,
as
Wyvil
had
hastily
retired
into
a
recess
,
she
could
see
no
one
.
 
<EOS>
Greatly
frightened
and
perplexed
,
Mrs.
Bloundel
rushed
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
,
to
see
whether
there
was
any
one
below
;
and
as
she
did
so
,
Wyvil
slipped
into
the
room
,
and
locked
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
only
object
he
beheld
--
for
he
had
eyes
for
nothing
else
--
was
Amabel
,
who
,
seeing
him
,
uttered
a
faint
scream
.
<EOS>
Clasping
her
in
his
arms
,
Wyvil
forgot
,
in
the
delirium
of
the
moment
,
the
jeopardy
in
which
he
was
placed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
what
has
happened
?
"
cried
Amabel
,
extricating
herself
from
his
embrace
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
all
,
"
replied
her
lover
;
"
I
would
risk
a
thousand
deaths
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
You
must
fly
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Fly
!
"
exclaimed
Amabel
;
"
at
such
a
time
as
this?--my
brother
dying
--
the
whole
house
,
perhaps
,
infected
!
<EOS>
How
can
you
ask
me
to
fly
?
<EOS>
Why
have
you
come
hither
?
<EOS>
You
will
destroy
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
,
sweet
Amabel
,
"
replied
Wyvil
,
ardently
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
bear
you
from
the
reach
of
this
horrible
disease
.
<EOS>
I
am
come
to
save
you
,
and
will
not
stir
without
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
shall
I
do
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Amabel
,
distractedly
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
rightly
punished
for
my
disobedience
and
ingratitude
to
my
dear
father
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Wyvil
,
I
did
not
deserve
this
from
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
,
Amabel
,
"
cried
her
lover
;
"
I
implore
your
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
What
I
have
done
has
been
from
irresistible
passion
,
and
from
no
other
cause
.
<EOS>
You
promised
to
meet
me
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
you
half
consented
to
fly
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
prepared
all
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
came
hither
burning
with
impatience
for
the
meeting
.
<EOS>
I
received
no
signal
,
but
encountering
your
father
's
apprentice
,
was
informed
that
you
were
attacked
by
the
plague
.
<EOS>
Imagine
my
horror
and
distress
at
the
intelligence
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
would
have
killed
me
.
<EOS>
I
determined
,
however
,
at
all
risks
,
to
see
you
once
more
--
to
clasp
you
in
my
arms
before
you
died
--
to
die
with
you
,
if
need
be
.
<EOS>
I
accomplished
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
entered
the
house
unobserved
.
<EOS>
I
overheard
the
servants
<EOS>
say
it
was
your
brother
who
was
ill
,
not
you
.
<EOS>
I
also
learnt
that
you
were
in
your
mother
's
room
.
<EOS>
I
found
the
door
,
and
by
a
fortunate
device
,
obtained
admittance
.
<EOS>
Now
you
know
all
,
and
will
you
not
fly
with
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
_
can
_
I
fly
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Amabel
,
gazing
wildly
round
the
room
,
as
if
in
search
of
some
place
of
refuge
or
escape
,
and
,
noticing
her
little
sister
,
Christiana
,
who
was
lying
asleep
in
the
bed--"Oh
!
<EOS>
how
I
envy
that
innocent
!
"
<EOS>
she
murmured
.
 
<EOS>
"
Think
of
nothing
but
yourself
,
"
rejoined
Wyvil
,
seizing
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
stay
here
,
it
will
be
to
perish
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
Trust
to
me
,
and
I
will
secure
your
flight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
cannot
--
I
dare
not
,
"
cried
Amabel
,
resisting
him
with
all
her
force
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
_
must
_
come
,
"
cried
Wyvil
,
dragging
her
along
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
who
had
been
down
to
Blaize
's
room
to
ascertain
what
was
the
matter
,
returned
.
<EOS>
Trying
the
door
,
and
finding
it
fastened
,
she
became
greatly
alarmed
,
and
called
to
Amabel
to
open
it
directly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
mother
,
"
cried
Amabel
.
"
<EOS>
Pity
me
,
Heaven
!
<EOS>
I
shall
die
with
shame
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heed
her
not
,
"
replied
Wyvil
,
in
a
deep
whisper
;
"
in
her
surprise
and
confusion
at
seeing
me
,
she
will
not
be
able
to
stop
us
.
<EOS>
Do
not
hesitate
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
,
child
?
"
cried
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
Why
have
you
fastened
the
door
?
<EOS>
Is
there
any
one
in
the
room
with
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
hears
us
,
"
whispered
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
What
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
You
must
not
be
seen
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
use
in
further
concealment
,
"
cried
Wyvil
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
mine
,
and
twenty
mothers
should
not
bar
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
cried
Amabel
,
disengaging
herself
by
a
sudden
effort
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
gone
too
far
--
but
not
so
far
as
you
imagine
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
utterly
lost
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
before
she
could
be
prevented
,
she
rushed
to
the
door
,
threw
it
open
,
and
flung
herself
into
her
mother
's
arms
,
who
uttered
an
exclamation
of
terror
at
beholding
Wyvil
.
<EOS>
The
latter
,
though
filled
with
rage
and
confusion
,
preserved
an
unmoved
exterior
,
and
folded
his
arms
upon
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
it
was
you
who
knocked
at
the
door
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
regarding
the
gallant
with
a
look
of
fury--"it
<EOS>
was
you
who
contrived
to
delude
me
into
opening
it
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
ask
why
you
have
come
hither
like
a
thief
in
the
night
,
because
I
require
no
information
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
You
are
come
to
dishonour
my
child
--
to
carry
her
away
from
those
who
love
her
and
cherish
her
,
and
would
preserve
her
from
such
mischievous
serpents
as
you
.
<EOS>
But
,
Heaven
be
praised
!
<EOS>
I
have
caught
you
before
your
wicked
design
could
Be
effected
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Amabel
,
my
child
,
my
child
!
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
straining
her
to
her
bosom
,
"
I
had
rather
--
far
rather
--
<EOS>
see
you
stricken
with
the
plague
,
like
your
poor
brother
,
though
I
felt
there
was
not
a
hope
of
your
recovery
,
than
you
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
this
Satan
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
greatly
to
blame
,
dear
mother
,
"
returned
Amabel
,
bursting
into
tears
;
"
and
I
shall
neither
seek
to
exculpate
myself
,
nor
conceal
what
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
I
have
deceived
you
and
my
father
.
<EOS>
I
have
secretly
encouraged
the
addresses
of
this
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
if
the
plague
had
not
broken
out
in
our
house
to
-
night
,
I
should
have
flown
from
it
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shock
me
,
greatly
,
child
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Bloundel
;
"
but
you
relieve
me
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
Make
a
clean
breast
,
and
hide
nothing
from
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
more
to
tell
,
dear
mother
,
"
replied
Amabel
,
"
except
that
Maurice
Wyvil
has
been
in
the
room
ever
since
you
left
it
,
and
might
,
perhaps
,
have
carried
me
off
in
spite
of
my
resistance
,
if
you
had
not
returned
when
you
did
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
,
indeed
,
a
providential
interference
,
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
From
what
a
snare
of
the
evil
one
--
from
what
a
pitfall
have
you
been
preserved
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
I
have
had
a
narrow
escape
,
dear
mother
,
"
replied
Amabel
.
"
<EOS>
Pardon
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
deserve
your
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
never
offend
you
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
forgive
you
from
my
heart
,
child
,
and
will
trust
you
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
in
a
voice
broken
by
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
more
than
I
would
,
"
thought
Maurice
Wyvil
.
<EOS>
"
A
woman
who
has
once
deceived
those
she
holds
dear
,
will
not
fail
to
do
so
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
The
fairest
promises
are
forgotten
when
the
danger
is
past
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wyvil
,
if
you
have
a
particle
of
regard
for
me
,
you
will
instantly
leave
the
house
,
"
said
Amabel
,
turning
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
had
my
own
way
,
he
should
leave
it
through
the
window
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bloundel
;
"
and
if
he
tarries
a
minute
longer
,
I
will
give
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
hear
this
,
sir
,
"
cried
Amabel:--"go
,
I
entreat
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
yield
to
circumstance
,
Amabel
,
"
replied
Wyvil
;
"
but
think
not
I
resign
you
.
<EOS>
Come
what
will
,
and
however
I
may
be
foiled
,
I
will
not
desist
till
I
make
you
mine
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
tremble
to
hear
him
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
"
and
could
not
have
believed
such
depravity
existed
.
<EOS>
Quit
the
house
,
sir
,
directly
,
or
I
will
have
you
turned
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
not
remain
another
moment
,
"
implored
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
,
do
not
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Since
I
have
no
other
way
of
proving
my
love
,
I
must
perforce
obey
,
"
returned
Wyvil
,
trying
to
snatch
her
hand
and
press
it
to
his
lips
;
but
she
withdrew
it
,
and
clung
more
closely
to
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
We
part
,
"
he
added
,
significantly
,
"
only
for
a
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
Quitting
the
room
,
he
was
about
to
descend
the
stairs
,
when
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
who
had
followed
to
see
him
safely
off
the
premises
,
hearing
a
noise
below
,
occasioned
by
the
return
of
Leonard
with
the
doctor
,
cautioned
him
to
wait
.
<EOS>
A
further
delay
was
caused
by
Blaize
,
who
,
stationing
himself
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
,
with
a
light
in
his
hand
,
appeared
unwilling
to
move
.
<EOS>
Apprehensive
of
a
discovery
,
Mrs.
Bloundel
then
directed
the
gallant
to
the
back
staircase
,
and
he
had
got
about
halfway
down
,
when
he
was
surprised
by
Leonard
Holt
,
as
before
related
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
very
moment
that
Wyvil
was
overtaken
on
the
landing
by
the
apprentice
,
Amabel
appeared
at
the
door
of
her
chamber
with
a
light
.
<EOS>
The
different
emotions
of
each
party
at
this
unexpected
rencontre
may
be
imagined
.
<EOS>
Leonard
Holt
,
with
a
breast
boiling
with
jealous
rage
,
prepared
to
attack
his
rival
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
weapon
about
him
,
having
left
his
cudgel
in
the
shop
,
but
he
doubled
his
fists
,
and
,
nerved
by
passion
,
felt
he
had
the
force
of
a
Hercules
in
his
arm
.
<EOS>
Wyvil
,
in
his
turn
,
kept
his
hand
upon
his
sword
,
and
glanced
at
his
mistress
,
as
if
seeking
instructions
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
who
formed
one
of
the
group
,
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leonard
Holt
,
"
she
said
,
"
show
this
person
out
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Do
not
lose
sight
of
him
for
an
instant
;
and
,
as
soon
as
he
is
gone
,
try
to
find
out
how
he
entered
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
entered
it
like
a
robber
,
"
returned
Leonard
,
looking
fiercely
at
the
gallant
,
"
and
if
I
did
my
strict
duty
,
I
should
seize
him
and
give
him
in
charge
to
the
watch
.
<EOS>
He
has
come
here
for
the
purpose
of
stealing
my
master
's
chief
valuable
--
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
aware
of
it
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
"
and
nothing
but
consideration
for
my
husband
prevents
my
delivering
him
up
to
justice
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
he
may
go
free
.
<EOS>
But
should
he
return--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
catch
him
here
again
,
"
interrupted
Leonard
,
"
I
will
shoot
him
as
I
would
a
dog
,
though
I
should
be
hanged
for
the
deed
.
<EOS>
Have
you
considered
well
what
you
are
doing
,
madam
?
<EOS>
I
would
not
presume
beyond
my
station
,
but
there
are
seasons
when
an
inferior
may
give
wholesome
advice
.
<EOS>
Are
you
certain
you
are
acting
as
your
worthy
husband
<EOS>
would
,
in
allowing
this
person
to
depart
?
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
doubt
,
speak
.
<EOS>
Fear
nothing
.
<EOS>
Unarmed
as
I
am
,
I
am
a
match
for
him
,
and
will
detain
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
heed
what
Leonard
says
,
dear
mother
,
"
interposed
Amabel
.
"
<EOS>
For
my
sake
,
let
Mr.
Wyvil
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
have
<EOS>
_
considered
the
matter
,
Leonard
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
"
and
trust
I
am
acting
rightly
.
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
I
am
sure
I
am
sparing
my
husband
pain
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
mistaken
tenderness
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
,
"
and
Heaven
grant
<EOS>
you
may
not
have
cause
to
repent
it
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
your
permission
,
I
would
so
deal
with
this
audacious
intruder
,
that
he
should
never
venture
to
repeat
his
visit
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
you
speak
safely
,
fellow
,
"
rejoined
Wyvil
,
"
and
you
,
therefore
,
give
full
license
to
your
scurrile
tongue
.
<EOS>
But
a
time
will
come
when
I
will
chastise
your
insolence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
more
of
this
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
Do
as
I
bid
you
,
Leonard
;
and
,
as
you
value
my
regard
,
say
nothing
of
what
has
occurred
to
your
master
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sullenly
acquiescing
,
the
apprentice
preceded
Wyvil
to
the
shop
,
and
opened
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
other
passed
through
it
,
he
said
,
"
You
spoke
of
chastising
me
just
now
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
courage
enough
--
which
I
doubt
--
to
make
good
your
words
,
and
will
wait
for
me
for
five
minutes
,
near
Saint
Alban
's
Church
in
this
street
,
you
shall
have
the
opportunity
.
"
 
<EOS>
Wyvil
did
not
deign
a
reply
,
but
wrapping
his
cloak
around
him
,
strode
away
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
proceeded
far
,
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
,
possibly
,
notwithstanding
his
interdiction
,
some
of
his
companions
might
be
waiting
for
him
,
and
hurrying
down
the
passage
leading
to
the
yard
,
he
found
Lydyard
,
to
whom
he
recounted
his
ill
-
success
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
,
however
,
abandon
my
design
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
These
failures
are
only
incentives
to
further
exertion
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
meantime
,
you
must
pay
your
wager
to
Sedley
,
"
laughed
Lydyard
,
"
and
as
the
house
is
really
infected
with
the
plague
,
it
behoves
you
to
call
at
the
first
apothecary
's
shop
we
find
open
,
and
get
your
apparel
fumigated
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
neglect
due
precautions
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
replied
Wyvil
,
"
<EOS>
and
as
I
feel
too
restless
to
go
home
at
present
,
suppose
we
amuse
ourselves
by
calling
on
some
astrologer
,
to
see
whether
the
stars
are
favourable
to
my
pursuit
of
this
girl
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
good
idea
,
"
replied
Lydyard
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
plenty
of
the
'
Sons
of
Urania
,
'
as
they
term
themselves
,
hereabouts
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
mere
juggler
will
not
serve
my
turn
,
"
returned
Wyvil
.
 
<EOS>
"
William
Lilly
,
the
almanack
-
maker
,
who
predicted
the
plague
,
and
,
if
old
Rowley
is
to
be
believed
,
has
great
skill
in
the
occult
sciences

lives
somewhere
in
Friday

not

Agreed

THE
POMANDER
-
BOX
.
 
<EOS>
Any
doubts
entertained
by
Leonard
Holt
as
to
the
manner
in
which
his
rival
entered
the
house
,
were
removed
by
discovering
the
open
window
in
the
passage
and
the
rope
-
ladder
hanging
to
the
yard
-
wall
.
<EOS>
Taking
the
ladder
away
,
and
making
all
as
secure
as
he
could
,
he
next
seized
his
cudgel
,
and
proceeded
to
Blaize
's
room
,
with
the
intention
of
inflicting
upon
him
the
punishment
he
had
threatened
:
for
he
naturally
enough
attributed
to
the
porter
's
carelessness
all
the
mischief
that
had
just
occurred
.
<EOS>
Not
meeting
with
him
,
however
,
and
concluding
he
was
in
the
kitchen
,
he
descended
thither
,
and
found
him
in
such
a
pitiable
plight
,
that
his
wrath
was
instantly
changed
to
compassion
.
 
<EOS>
Stretched
upon
the
hearth
before
a
blazing
sea
-
coal
fire
,
which
seemed
large
enough
to
roast
him
,
with
his
head
resting
upon
the
lap
of
Patience
,
the
pretty
kitchen
-
maid
,
and
his
left
hand
upon
his
heart
,
the
porter
loudly
complained
of
a
fixed
and
burning
pain
in
that
region
;
while
his
mother
,
who
was
kneeling
beside
him
,
having
just
poured
a
basin
of
scalding
posset
-
drink
down
his
throat
,
entreated
him
to
let
her
examine
his
side
to
see
whether
he
had
any
pestilential
mark
upon
it
,
but
he
vehemently
resisted
her
efforts
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
feel
any
swelling
,
myn
lief
zoon
?
<EOS>
"
asked
old
Josyna
,
trying
to
remove
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Swelling
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Blaize,--"there
's
a
tumour
as
big
as
an
egg
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
i

exclaimed
Josyna
,
in
great
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
Do

"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
leave

"
rejoined
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
disturb
me
further
.
<EOS>
You
will
catch
the
distemper
if
you
touch

<EOS>
"
Dat

groaned
Blaize

"
<EOS>
Leave

<EOS>
You

shockingly

<EOS>

Poor

Josyna

soothingly

rejoined
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
Your

are
like

<EOS>
Keep

<EOS>
"
Bless

Iron

<EOS>
"
I

"
groaned
her

.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not

for
this

.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
do
n't
say
so
,
dear
Blaize
,
"
sobbed
Patience
,
letting
fall
a
plentiful
shower
of
tears
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
so
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
to
part
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
do
n't
survive
me
,
"
returned
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
there
's
little
chance
of
your
doing
so
.
<EOS>
You
are
certain
to
take
the
plague
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
care
not
what
becomes
of
myself
,
if
I
lose
you
,
Blaize
,
"
responded
Patience
,
bedewing
his
countenance
with
another
shower
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
hope
you
wo
n't
die
yet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
it
's
all
over
with
me
--
all
over
,
"
rejoined
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
Leonard
Holt
how
it
would
be
.
<EOS>
I
said
I
should
be
the
next
victim
.
<EOS>
And
my
words
are
come
true
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
as
clever
as
a
conjurer
,
"
sobbed
Patience
;
"
but
I
wish
you
had
n't
been
right
in
this
instance
.
<EOS>
However
,
comfort
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
'll
die
with
you
.
<EOS>
We
'll
be
carried
to
the
grave
in
the
same
plague
-
cart
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
cold
comfort
,
"
returned
Blaize
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
you
'll
never
mention
the
plague
-
cart
again
.
<EOS>
The
thought
of
it
makes
me
shiver
all
over
--
<EOS>
oh
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
uttered
a
dismal
and
prolonged
groan
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
Leonard
thought
it
time
to
interfere
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
really
attacked
by
the
plague
,
Blaize
,
"
he
said
,
advancing
,
"
you
must
have
instant
advice
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
is
still
upstairs
with
our
master
.
<EOS>
He
must
see
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
no
account
,
"
returned
the
porter
,
in
the
greatest
alarm
,
and
springing
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
better
--
much
better
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
am
ill
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
the
first
time
,
I
suspect
the
contrary
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
,
"
since
you
are
afraid
of
owning
it
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
not
a
matter
to
be
trifled
with
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
will
soon
settle
the
point
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
hurried
out
of
the
room
to
summon
the
physician
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
mother!--dear
Patience
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
roared
Blaize
,
capering
about
in
an
ecstasy
of
terror
<EOS>
;
"
do
n't
let
the
doctor
come
near
me
.
<EOS>
Keep
me
out
of
his
sight
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
what
horrid
things
are
done
to
those
afflicted
with
my
complaint
.
<EOS>
But
I
do,--for
I
have
informed
myself
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Their
skins
are
scarified
,
and
their
sores
blistered
,
lanced
,
cauterized
,
and
sometimes
burned
away
with
a
knob
of
red
-
hot
iron
,
called
'
the
button

<EOS>
"
But

Blaize

replied
his
mother
.
<EOS>
"
Never

hod
iron
or
de
lance
,
or
de
blisder
,
iv
dey
make
you

<EOS>
Never
mind
de
pain
.
<EOS>
It
will
soon
be
over
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Soon
over
!
"
bellowed
Blaize
,
sinking
into
a
chair
.
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
feel
it
will
.
<EOS>
But
not
in
the
way
you
imagine
.
<EOS>
This
Doctor
Hodges
will
kill
me
.
<EOS>
He
is
fond
of
trying
experiments
,
and
will
make
me
his
subject
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
him
--
for
pity
's
sake
,
do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
musd
,
myn
lief
jonger
,
"
replied
his
mother
,
"
I
musd
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Patience
!
"
supplicated
Blaize
,
"
you
were
always
fond
of
me
.
<EOS>
My
mother
has
lost
her
natural
affection
.
<EOS>
She
wishes
to
get
rid
of
me
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
take
part
with
her
.
<EOS>
My
sole
dependence
is
upon
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
all
I
can
for
you
,
dear
Blaize
,
"
blubbered
the
kitchen
-
maid
.
"
<EOS>
But
it
is
absolutely
necessary
you
should
see
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
wo
n't
stay
here
another
minute
,
"
vociferated
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
die
in
the
street
rather
than
under
his
hands
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
bursting
from
them
,
he
would
have
made
good
his
retreat
,
but
for
the
entrance
of
Leonard
and
Hodges
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
sight
of
the
latter
,
Blaize
ran
back
and
endeavoured
to
screen
himself
behind
Patience
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
this
the
sick
man
?
"
remarked
Hodges
,
scarcely
able
to
refrain
from
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
he
can
be
in
such
imminent
danger
as
you
led
me
to
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
am
better
--
much
better
,
thank
you
,
"
returned
Blaize
,
still
keeping
Patience
between
him
and
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
The
very
sight
of
you
has
frightened
away
the
plague
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Hodges
,
smiling
,
"
then
it
is
the
most
marvellous
cure
I
ever
yet
effected
.
<EOS>
But
,
come
forward
,
young
man
,
and
let
us
see
what
is
the
matter
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
neither
lance
nor
cauterize
an
incipient
tumour
,
do
you
,
doctor
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Blaize
,
without
abandoning
his
position
.
 
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
day
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Hodges
,
"
have
we
one
of
the
faculty
here
?
<EOS>
I
see
how
it
is
,
friend
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
reading
some
silly
book
about
the
disease
,
and
have
frightened
yourself
into
the
belief
that
you
have
some
of
its
symptoms
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
n't
been
doctoring
yourself
,
likewise
.
<EOS>
What
have
you
taken
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
difficult
to
say
what
he
has
_
not
_
taken
,
"
remarked
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
stomach
must
be
like
an
apothecary
's
shop
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
used
proper
precautions
,
"
rejoined
Blaize
,
testily
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
may
those
be
--
eh
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
curious
to
learn
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
from
behind
Patience
,
"
cried
Leonard
,
"
and
do
n't
act
the
fool
longer
,
or
I
will
see
whether
your
disorder
will
not
yield
to
a
sound
application
of
the
cudgel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
rate
him
thus
,
good
Master
Leonard
,
"
interposed
Patience
.
"
He
is
very
ill
--
he
is
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
let
him
have
a
chance
of
getting
better
,
"
returned
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
_
is
_
ill
,
he
has
no
business
near
you
.
<EOS>
Come
from
behind
her
,
Blaize
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
Now
speak
,
"
he
added
,
as
the
porter
crept
tremblingly
forth
,
"
and
let
us
hear
what
nostrums
you
have
swallowed
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
have
dosed
yourself
with
pills
,
electuaries
,
balsams
,
tinctures
,
conserves
,
spirits
,
elixirs
,
decoctions
,
and
every
other
remedy
,
real
or
imaginary
.
<EOS>
What
else
have
you
done
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
Dr.
Hodges
,
I
am
sure
,
will
approve
,
"
replied
Blaize
,
confidently
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
rubbed
myself
with
vinegar
,
oil
of
sulphur
,
extract
of
tar
,
and
spirit
of
turpentine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
next
?
"
demanded
Hodges
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
placed
saltpetre
,
brimstone
,
amber
,
and
juniper
upon
a
chafing
-
dish
to
fumigate
my
room
,
"
replied
Blaize
;
"
but
the
vapour
was
so
overpowering
,
I
could
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
surprised
if
you
could
,
"
replied
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
is
astonishing
to
me
,
if
you
have
taken
half
the
remedies
Leonard
says
you
have
,
and
which
,
taken
in
this
way
,
are
no
remedies
at
all
,
since
they
counteract
each
other
--
that
you
are
still
alive
.
<EOS>
But
let
us
see
what
is
the
matter
with
you
.
<EOS>
What
ails
you
particularly
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
replied
Blaize
,
trembling
;
"
I
am
quite
well
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
complains
of
a
fixed
pain
near
de
haard
,
docdor
,
"
interposed
his
mother
,
"
and
says
he
has
a
large
dumour
on
his
side
.
<EOS>
But
he
wond
let
me
examine
i
d
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
bad
sign
,
"
observed
Hodges
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
it
's
not
all
fancy
,
as
I
at
first
supposed
.
<EOS>
Have
you
felt
sick
of
late
,
young
man
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
of
late
,
"
replied
Blaize
,
becoming
as
white
as
ashes
;
"
but
I
do
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Another
bad
symptom
,
"
rejoined
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
Take
off
your
doublet
and
open
your
shirt
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
as
the
doctor
bids
you
,
"
said
Leonard
,
seeing
that
Blaize
hesitated
,
"
or
I
apply
the
cudgel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
bless
my
life
!
<EOS>
what
's
this
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Hodges
,
running
his
hand
down
the
left
side
of
the
porter
,
and
meeting
with
a
large
lump
.
"
<EOS>
Can
it
be
a
carbuncle
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
's
a
terrible
carbuncle
,
"
replied
Blaize
;
"
but
do
n't
cauterize
it
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
look
at
it
,
"
cried
Hodges
,
"
and
I
shall
then
know
how
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
,
he
tore
open
the
porter
's
shirt
,
and
a
silver
ball
,
about
as
large
as
a
pigeon
's
egg
,
fell
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Leonard
picked
it
up
,
and
found
it
so
hot
that
he
could
scarcely
hold
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
is
the
terrible
carbuncle
,
"
he
cried
,
with
a
laugh
,
in
which
all
the
party
,
except
Blaize
,
joined
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
pomander
-
box
,
"
said
the
latter
.
<EOS>
"
I
filled
it
with
a
mixture
of
citron
-
peel
,
angelica
seed
,
zedoary
,
yellow
saunders
,
aloes
,
benzoin
,
camphor
,
and
gum
-
tragacanth
,
moistened
with
spirit
of
roses
;
and
after
placing
it
on
the
chafing
-
dish
to
heat
it
,
hung
it
by
a
string
round
my
neck
,
next
my
dried
toad
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
by
some
means
or
other
,
it
dropped
through
my
doublet
,
and
found
its
way
to
my
side
.
<EOS>
I
felt
a
dreadful
burning
there
,
and
that
made
me
fancy
<EOS>
I
was
attacked
by
the
plague
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
very
satisfactory
solution
of
the
mystery
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
doctor
,
laughing
;
"
and
you
may
think
yourself
well
off
with
the
blister
which
your
box
has
raised
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
easier
to
bear
than
the
cataplasm
I
should
have
given
you
,
had
your
apprehensions
been
well
founded
.
<EOS>
As
yet
,
you
are
free
from
infection
,
young
man
;
but
if
you
persist
in
this
silly
and
pernicious
practice
of
quacking
yourself
,
you
will
infallibly
bring
on
some
fatal
disorder
--
perhaps
the
plague
itself
.
<EOS>
If
your
mother
has
any
regard
for
you
she
will
put
all
your
medicines
out
of
your
reach
.
<EOS>
There
are
few
known
remedies
against
this
frightful
disease
;
and
what
few
there
are
,
must
be
adopted
cautiously
.
<EOS>
My
own
specific
is
sack
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sack
!
"
exclaimed
Blaize
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
Henceforth
,
I
will
drink
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
I
like
the
remedy
amazingly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
taken
in
moderation
,
"
said
the
doctor
:
"
<EOS>
otherwise
it
is
as
dangerous
as
too
much
physic
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
boddle
or
doo
of
de
liquor
<EOS>
you
commend
,
docdor
,
in
my
private
cupboard
,
"
observed
Josyna
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will
you
dasde
i
d
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
With
great
pleasure
,
"
replied
Hodges
,
"
and
a
drop
of
it
will
do
your
son
no
harm
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
wine
was
accordingly
produced
,
and
the
doctor
pronounced
it
excellent
,
desiring
that
a
glass
might
always
be
brought
him
when
he
visited
the
grocer
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
rely
upon
i
d
,
mynheer
,
as
long
as
my
small
sdore
lasds
,
"
replied
Josyna
.
 
<EOS>
Blaize
,
who
,
in
obedience
to
the
doctor
's
commands
,
had
drained
a
large
glass
of
sack
,
felt
so
much
inspirited
by
it
,
that
he
ventured
,
when
his
mother
's
back
was
turned
,
to
steal
a
kiss
from
Patience
,
and
to
whisper
in
her
ear
,
that
if
he
escaped
the
plague
,
he
would
certainly
marry
her
--
an
assurance
that
seemed
to
give
her
no
slight
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
His
new
-
born
courage
,
however
,
was
in
some
degree
damped
by
Leonard
,
who
observed
to
him
in
an
undertone
:
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
neglected
my
injunctions
,
sirrah
,
and
allowed
the
person
I
warned
you
of
to
enter
the
house
.
<EOS>
When
a
fitting
season
arrives
,
I
will
not
fail
to
pay
off
old
scores
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Blaize
would
have
remonstrated
,
and
asked
for
some
explanation
,
but
the
apprentice
instantly
left
him
,
and
set
out
upon
his
errand
to
the
Examiner
of
Health
.
<EOS>
Accompanied
by
his
mother
,
who
would
not
even
allow
him
to
say
good
-
night
to
Patience
,
the
porter
then
proceeded
to
his
own
room
,
where
the
old
woman
,
to
his
infinite
regret
,
carried
off
his
stores
of
medicine
in
a
basket
,
which
she
brought
with
her
for
that
purpose
,
and
locked
the
door
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
has
escaped
her
,
"
said
Blaize
,
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
,
opening
a
secret
drawer
in
the
cupboard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
fortunate
that
I
kept
this
reserve
.
<EOS>
I
have
still
a
tolerable
supply
in
case
of
need
.
<EOS>
Let
me
examine
my
stock
.
<EOS>
First
of
all
,
there
are
plague
-
lozenges
,
composed
of
angelica
,
liquorice
,
flower
of
sulphur
,
myrrh
,
and
oil
of
cinnamon
.
<EOS>
Secondly
,
an
electuary
of
bole
-
armoniac
,
hartshorn
-
shavings
,
saffron
,
and
syrup
of
wood
-
sorrel
.
<EOS>
I
long
to
taste
it
.
<EOS>
But
then
it
would
be
running
in
the
doctor
's
teeth
.
<EOS>
Thirdly
,
there
is
a
phial
labelled
<EOS>
_
Aqua
Theriacalis
Stillatitia_--in
plain
English
,
distilled
treacle
-
water
.
<EOS>
A
spoonful
of
this
could
n't
hurt
me
.
<EOS>
Fourthly
,
a
packet
of
powders
,
entitled
_
Manus
Christi_--an
excellent
mixture
.
<EOS>
Fifthly
,
a
small
pot
of
diatesseron
,
composed
of
gentian
,
myrrh
,
bayberries
,
and
round
aristolochia
.
<EOS>
I
must
just
taste
it
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
the
doctor
!
<EOS>
He
does
not
know
what
agrees
with
my
constitution
as
well
as
I
do
myself
.
<EOS>
Physic
comes
as
naturally
to
me
as
mother
's
milk
.
<EOS>
Sixthly
,
there
is
_
Aqua
Epidemica
_
,
commonly
called
the
Plague
-
Water
of
Matthias
--
delicious
stuff
!
<EOS>
I
will
only
just
sip
it
.
<EOS>
What
a
fine
bitter
it
has
!
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
it
must
be
very
wholesome
.
<EOS>
Next
,
for
I
've
lost
my
count
,
comes
salt
of
vipers
--
next
,
powder
of
unicorn
's
horn
--
<EOS>
next
,
oil
of
scorpions
from
Naples
--
next
,
dragon
-
water
--
all
admirable
.
<EOS>
Then
there
are
cloves
of
garlics
--
sovereign
fortifiers
of
the
stomach
--
and
,
lastly
,
there
is
a
large
box
of
my
favourite
rufuses
.
<EOS>
How
many
pills
have
I
taken
?
<EOS>
Only
half
a
dozen
!
<EOS>
Three
more
may
as
well
go
to
keep
the
others
company
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
hastily
swallowing
them
,
as
if
afraid
of
detection
,
he
carefully
shut
the
drawer
,
and
then
crept
into
bed
,
and
,
covering
himself
with
blankets
,
endeavoured
to
compose
himself
to
slumber
.
 
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
,
meantime
,
returned
to
the
grocer
,
and
acquainted
him
that
it
was
a
false
alarm
,
and
that
the
porter
was
entirely
free
from
infection
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
replied
Bloundel
;
"
but
I
expected
as
much
.
<EOS>
Blaize
is
like
the
shepherd
's
boy
in
the
fable
:
he
has
cried
'
wolf
'
so
often
,
that
when
the
danger
really
arrives
,
no
one
will
heed
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
now
take
my
leave
,
Mr.
Bloundel
,
"
said
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
with
you
the
first
thing
to
-
morrow
,
and
have
little
doubt
I
shall
find
your
son
going
on
well
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
not
merely
take
care
of
him
,
but
of
yourself
,
and
your
household
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
well
to
set
a
chafing
-
dish
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
scatter
some
of
these
perfumes
occasionally
upon
it
!
"
<EOS>
and
producing
several
small
packets
,
he
gave
them
to
the
grocer
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
ever
smoke
a
pipe
,
I
would
advise
you
to
do
so
now
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
smoke
,
"
replied
Bloundel
,
"
and
hold
it
as
a
filthy
and
mischievous
habit
,
which
nothing
but
necessity
should
induce
me
to
practise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
advisable
now
,
"
returned
Hodges
,
"
and
you
should
neglect
no
precaution
.
<EOS>
Take
my
word
for
it
,
Mr.
Bloundel
,
the
plague
is
only
beginning
.
<EOS>
When
the
heats
of
summer
arrive
,
its
ravages
will
be
frightful
.
<EOS>
Heaven
only
knows
what
will
become
of
us
all
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
my
poor
son
is
spared
,
and
we
escape
contagion
,
"
returned
Bloundel
,
"
I
will
put
into
execution
a
scheme
which
has
occurred
to
me
,
and
which
(
under
Providence
!
)
<EOS>
will
,
I
trust
,
secure
my
family
from
further
hazard
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
what
is
that
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Hodges
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
talk
of
it
some
other
time
,
"
returned
Bloundel
"
Good
-
night
,
doctor
,
and
accept
my
thanks
for
your
attention
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
,
at
as
early
an
hour
as
you
can
make
convenient
,
I
shall
hope
to
see
you
.
"
<EOS>
And
with
a
friendly
shake
of
the
hand
,
and
a
reiteration
of
advice
and
good
wishes
,
Hodges
departed
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
the
apprentice
returned
,
and
by
his
master
's
directions
,
placed
a
chafing
-
dish
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
supplying
it
with
the
drugs
and
herbs
left
by
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
About
four
o'clock
,
a
loud
knocking
was
heard
.
<EOS>
Instantly
answering
the
summons
,
Leonard
found
four
men
at
the
shop
-
door
,
two
of
whom
he
knew
,
by
red
wands
they
carried
,
were
searchers
;
while
their
companions
appeared
to
be
undertakers
,
from
their
sable
habits
and
long
black
cloaks
.
 
<EOS>
Marching
unceremoniously
into
the
shop
,
the
searchers
desired
to
see
the
sick
man
;
and
the
apprentice
then
perceived
that
one
of
the
men
in
black
cloaks
was
the
coffin
-
maker
,
Chowles
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
however
,
refuse
him
admittance
,
and
led
the
way
to
the
grocer
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
As
they
entered
it
,
Bloundel
arose
,
and
placing
his
finger
to
his
lips
in
token
of
silence
,
raised
the
blankets
,
and
exhibited
the
blotch
,
which
had
greatly
increased
in
size
,
under
the
arm
of
his
slumbering
son
.
<EOS>
The
foremost
of
the
searchers
,
who
kept
a
phial
of
vinegar
to
his
nose
all
the
time
he
remained
in
the
room
,
then
demanded
in
a
low
tone
whether
there
were
any
other
of
the
household
infected
?
<EOS>
The
grocer
replied
in
the
negative
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Chowles
,
whose
manner
showed
he
was
more
than
half
intoxicated
,
took
off
his
hat
,
and
bowing
obsequiously
to
the
grocer
,
said
,
"
Shall
I
prepare
you
a
coffin
,
Mr.
Bloundel?--you
are
sure
to
want
one
,
and
had
better
give
the
order
in
time
,
for
there
is
a
great
demand
for
such
articles
just
now
.
<EOS>
If
you
like
,
I
will
call
with
it
tomorrow
night
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
plague
-
cart
of
my
own
,
and
bury
all
my
customers
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
God
grant
<EOS>
I
may
not
require
your
services
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
replied
the
grocer
,
shuddering
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
give
you
timely
notice
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
in
want
of
a
nurse
,
I
can
recommend
an
experienced
one
,
"
added
Chowles
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
last
employer
is
just
dead
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
may
need
assistance
,
"
replied
the
grocer
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
.
<EOS>
"
Let
her
call
to
-
morrow
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
understands
her
business
perfectly
,
and
will
save
you
a
world
of
trouble
,
"
replied
Chowles
;
"
besides
securing
me
the
sale
of
another
coffin
,
"
he
added
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
quitted
the
room
with
the
searchers
,
and
Leonard
felt
inexpressibly
relieved
by
their
departure
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
party
gained
the
street
,
the
fourth
person
,
who
was
provided
with
materials
for
the
task
,
painted
a
red
cross
of
the
prescribed
size
--
namely
,
a
foot
in
length
--
in
the
middle
of
the
door
;
tracing
above
it
,
in
large
characters
,
the
melancholy
formula--"LORD
,
HAVE
MERCY
UPON
US
!
"
  
<EOS>
VI
.
 
<EOS>
THE
LIBERTINE
PUNISHED
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
and
Major
Pillichody
arrived
without
any
particular
adventure
at
the
top
of
the
Haymarket
,
where
the
former
dismissed
the
coach
he
had
hired
in
Cheapside
,
and
they
proceeded
towards
Piccadilly
on
foot
.
<EOS>
Up
to
this
time
the
major
had
been
in
very
high
spirits
,
boasting
what
he
would
do
,
in
case
they
encountered
Disbrowe
,
and
offering
to
keep
guard
outside
the
door
while
the
knight
remained
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
But
he
now
began
to
alter
his
tone
,
and
to
frame
excuses
to
get
away
.
<EOS>
He
had
noticed
with
some
uneasiness
,
that
another
coach
stopped
lower
down
the
Haymarket
,
at
precisely
the
same
time
as
their
own
;
and
though
he
could
not
be
quite
certain
of
the
fact
,
he
fancied
he
perceived
a
person
greatly
resembling
Captain
Disbrowe
alight
from
it
.
<EOS>
Mentioning
the
circumstance
to
his
companion
,
he
pointed
out
a
tall
figure
following
them
at
some
distance
;
but
the
other
only
laughed
at
him
,
and
said
,
"
It
may
possibly
be
Disbrowe
--
but
what
if
it
is
?
<EOS>
He
can
not
get
into
the
house
without
the
key
;
and
if
he
is
inclined
to
measure
swords
with
me
a
second
time
,
he
shall
not
escape
so
lightly
as
he
did
the
first
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Right
,
Sir
Paul
,
right
,
"
returned
Pillichody
,
"
exterminate
him
--
spare
him
not
.
<EOS>
By
Bellerophon
!
<EOS>
that
's
my
way
.
<EOS>
My
only
apprehension
is
lest
he
should
set
upon
us
unawares
.
<EOS>
The
bravest
are
not
proof
against
the
dagger
of
an
assassin
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
you
wrong
Disbrowe
,
major
,
I
am
persuaded
,
"
returned
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
too
much
a
man
of
honour
to
stab
a
foe
behind
his
back
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
,
"
replied
Pillichody
,
"
but
jealousy
will
sometimes
turn
a
man
's
brain
.
<EOS>
By
the
snakes
of
Tisiphone
!
<EOS>
I
have
known
an
instance
of
it
myself
.
<EOS>
I
once
made
love
to
a
tailor
's
wife
,
and
the
rascal
coming
in
unawares
,
struck
me
to
the
ground
with
his
goose
,
and
well
nigh
murdered
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
After
such
a
mischance
,
I
am
surprised
you
should
venture
to
carry
on
so
many
hazardous
intrigues
,
"
laughed
the
knight
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
proposed
just
now
to
keep
watch
outside
the
house
.
<EOS>
If
it
is
Disbrowe
who
is
following
us
,
you
had
better
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Sir
Paul
--
you
<EOS>
see,"--stammered
<EOS>
the
major
,
"
I
have
just
bethought
me
of
an
engagement
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
An
engagement
at
this
hour
--
impossible
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Parravicin
.
 
<EOS>
"
An
assignation
,
I
ought
to
say
,
"
returned
Pillichody
.
 
<EOS>
"
Couches
of
Cytheraea!--an
affair
like
your
own
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
have
me
keep
a
lady
waiting
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
strange
<EOS>
you
should
not
recollect
it
till
this
moment
,
"
replied
Parravicin
.
"
<EOS>
But
be
your
inamorata
whom
she
may
--
even
the
rich
widow
of
Watling
-
street
,
of
whom
you
prate
so
much
--
you
must
put
her
off
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
Sir
Paul----
"
 
"
I
will
have
no
denial
,
"
replied
the
knight
,
peremptorily
.
<EOS>
If
you
refuse
,
you
will
find
me
worse
to
deal
with
than
Disbrowe
.
<EOS>
You
must
remain
at
the
door
till
I
come
out
.
<EOS>
And
now
let
us
lose
no
more
time
.
<EOS>
I
am
impatient
to
behold
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Into
what
a
cursed
scrape
have
I
got
myself
!
"
<EOS>
thought
the
major
,
as
he
walked
by
the
side
of
his
companion
,
ever
and
anon
casting
wistful
glances
over
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
fairly
caught
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
.
<EOS>
I
instinctively
feel
that
Disbrowe
_
is
_
dogging
us
.
<EOS>
What
will
become
of
me
?
<EOS>
The
moment
this
harebrained
coxcomb
enters
the
house
,
I
will
see
whether
a
light
pair
of
heels
can
not
bear
me
out
of
harm
's
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
they
had
reached
a
passage
known
as
Bear
-
alley
(
all
traces
of
which
have
been
swept
away
by
modern
improvements
)
,
and
threading
it
,
they
entered
a
narrow
thoroughfare
,
called
Castle
-
street
.
<EOS>
Just
as
they
turned
the
corner
,
Pillichody
again
noticed
the
figure
at
the
further
end
of
the
alley
,
and
,
but
for
his
fears
of
the
knight
,
would
have
instantly
scampered
off
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
we
far
from
the
house
?
"
inquired
Parravicin
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
the
major
,
scarcely
able
to
conceal
his
trepidation
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
close
at
hand
--
and
so
is
the
lady
's
husband
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
better
,
"
replied
the
knight
;
"
it
will
afford
you
some
amusement
to
beat
him
off
.
<EOS>
You
may
affect
not
to
know
him
,
and
may
tell
him
the
lady
's
husband
is
just
come
home
--
her
<EOS>
_
husband_!--do
you
take
,
Pillichody
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
I
do
,
"
replied
the
major
,
in
a
quavering
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
n't
appear
to
relish
the
jest
,
"
rejoined
Parravicin
,
sneeringly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
I
relish
it
exceedingly
,
"
replied
Pillichody
;
"
her
husband
--
ha!--ha!--and
Disbrowe
is
the
disappointed
lover
--
capital
!
<EOS>
But
here
we
are
--
and
I
wish
we
were
anywhere
else
,
"
he
added
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
you
are
right
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Parravicin
,
searching
for
the
key
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
sure
,
"
returned
Pillichody
.
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
some
one
behind
that
wall
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
nothing
,
"
rejoined
the
knight
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
afraid
of
shadows
,
major
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Afraid
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thousand
thunders
!
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
of
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
,
I
shall
expect
to
find
you
have
slain
Disbrowe
,
on
my
return
,
"
rejoined
Parravicin
,
unlocking
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
night
is
chilly
,
"
observed
the
major
,
"
and
ever
since
my
campaigns
in
the
Low
Countries
,
I
have
been
troubled
with
rheumatism
.
<EOS>
I
should
prefer
keeping
guard
inside
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
you
must
remain
where
you
are
,
"
replied
the
knight
,
shutting
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Pillichody
was
about
to
take
to
his
heels
,
when
he
felt
himself
arrested
by
a
powerful
arm
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
roared
for
aid
,
but
a
voice
,
which
he
instantly
recognised
,
commanded
him
to
keep
silence
,
if
he
valued
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
your
companion
in
the
house
?
"
demanded
Disbrowe
,
in
a
hollow
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
say
he
is
,
Captain
Disbrowe
,
"
replied
the
bully
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
my
best
to
prevent
him
,
but
remonstrance
was
in
vain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Liar
,
"
cried
Disbrowe
,
striking
him
with
his
clenched
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
to
impose
upon
me
by
such
a
pitiful
fabrication
?
<EOS>
It
was
you
who
introduced
me
to
this
heartless
libertine
--
you
who
encouraged
me
to
play
with
him
,
telling
me
I
should
easily
strip
him
of
all
he
possessed
--
you
who
excited
his
passion
for
my
wife
,
by
praising
her
beauty
--
and
it
was
you
who
put
it
into
his
head
to
propose
that
fatal
stake
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
you
are
wrong
,
Captain
Disbrowe
,
"
returned
Pillichody
,
in
a
supplicatory
tone
.
<EOS>
"
On
my
soul
,
you
are
!
<EOS>
I
certainly
praised
your
wife
(
as
who
would
not
?
)
,
but
I
never
advised
Parravicin
to
play
for
her
.
<EOS>
That
was
his
own
idea
entirely
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
excuse
shall
not
avail
you
,
"
cried
Disbrowe
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
you
I
owe
all
my
misery
.
<EOS>
Draw
and
defend
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
not
so
hasty
,
captain
,
"
cried
Pillichody
,
abjectedly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
injured
you
sufficiently
already
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
your
blood
on
my
head
.
<EOS>
On
the
honour
of
a
soldier
,
I
am
sorry
for
the
wrong
I
have
done
you
,
and
will
strive
to
repair
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Repair
it
!
"
<EOS>
shrieked
Disbrowe
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
late
.
"
<EOS>
And
seizing
the
major
's
arm
,
he
dragged
him
by
main
force
into
the
alley
.
 
<EOS>
"
Help
!
<EOS>
help
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
you
murder
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
assuredly
cut
your
throat
,
if
you
keep
up
this
clamour
,
"
rejoined
Disbrowe
,
snatching
the
other
's
long
rapier
from
his
side
.
<EOS>
"
Coward
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
striking
him
with
the
flat
side
of
the
weapon
,
"
this
will
teach
you
to
mix
yourself
up
in
such
infamous
affairs
for
the
future
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
heedless
of
the
major
's
entreaties
and
vociferations
,
he
continued
to
belabour
him
,
until
compelled
by
fatigue
to
desist
;
when
the
other
,
contriving
to
extricate
himself
,
ran
off
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
.
<EOS>
Disbrowe
looked
after
him
for
a
moment
,
as
if
uncertain
whether
to
follow
,
and
then
hurrying
to
the
house
,
stationed
himself
beneath
the
porch
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
stab
him
as
he
comes
forth
,
"
he
muttered
,
drawing
his
sword
,
and
hiding
it
beneath
his
mantle
.
 
<EOS>
Parravicin
,
meanwhile
,
having
let
himself
into
the
house
,
marched
boldly
forward
,
though
the
passage
was
buried
in
darkness
,
and
he
was
utterly
unacquainted
with
it
.
<EOS>
Feeling
against
the
wall
,
he
presently
discovered
a
door
,
and
opening
it
,
entered
a
room
lighted
by
a
small
silver
lamp
placed
on
a
marble
slab
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
empty
,
but
its
furniture
and
arrangements
proclaimed
it
the
favourite
retreat
of
the
fair
mistress
of
the
abode
.
<EOS>
Parravicin
gazed
curiously
round
,
as
if
anxious
to
gather
from
what
he
saw
some
idea
of
the
person
he
so
soon
expected
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
Everything
betokened
a
refined
and
luxurious
taste
.
<EOS>
A
few
French
romances
,
the
last
plays
of
Etherege
,
Dryden
,
and
Shadwell
,
a
volume
of
Cowley
,
and
some
amorous
songs
,
lay
on
the
table
;
and
not
far
from
them
were
a
loomask
,
pulvil
purse
,
a
pair
of
scented
gloves
,
a
richly
-
laced
mouchoir
,
a
manteau
girdle
,
palatine
tags
,
and
a
golden
bodkin
for
the
hair
.
 
<EOS>
Examining
all
these
things
,
and
drawing
his
own
conclusions
as
to
the
character
of
their
owner
,
Parravicin
turned
to
a
couch
on
which
a
cittern
was
thrown
,
while
beside
it
,
on
a
cushion
,
were
a
pair
of
tiny
embroidered
velvet
slippers
.
<EOS>
A
pocket
-
mirror
,
or
sprunking
-
glass
,
as
it
was
then
termed
,
lay
on
a
side
-
table
,
and
near
it
stood
an
embossed
silver
chocolate
-
pot
,
and
a
small
porcelain
cup
with
a
golden
spoon
inside
it
,
showing
what
the
lady
's
last
repast
had
been
.
<EOS>
On
another
small
table
,
covered
with
an
exquisitely
white
napkin
,
stood
a
flask
of
wine
,
a
tall
-
stemmed
glass
,
and
a
few
cakes
on
a
China
dish
,
evidently
placed
there
for
Disbrowe
's
return
.
 
<EOS>
As
Parravicin
drew
near
this
table
,
a
slip
of
paper
,
on
which
a
few
lines
were
traced
,
attracted
his
attention
,
and
taking
it
up
,
he
read
as
follows
:
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
now
midnight
,
and
you
promised
to
return
early
.
<EOS>
I
have
felt
your
absence
severely
,
and
have
been
suffering
from
a
violent
headache
,
which
has
almost
distracted
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
also
been
troubled
with
strange
and
unaccountable
misgivings
respecting
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
little
easier
now
,
but
still
far
from
well
,
and
about
to
retire
to
rest
.
<EOS>
At
what
hour
will
this
meet
your
eye
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
MARGARET
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Charming
creature
!
"
exclaimed
Parravicin
,
as
the
paper
dropped
from
his
hand
;
"
she
little
dreamed
,
when
she
wrote
it
,
who
would
read
her
billet
.
<EOS>
Disbrowe
does
not
deserve
such
a
treasure
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
she
is
unwell
.
<EOS>
I
hope
she
has
not
taken
the
plague
.
<EOS>
Pshaw
,
what
could
put
such
an
idea
into
my
head
?
<EOS>
Lydyard
's
warning
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
That
fellow
,
who
is
the
veriest
rake
among
us
,
is
always
preaching
.
<EOS>
Confound
him
!
<EOS>
I
wish
he
had
not
mentioned
it
.
<EOS>
A
glass
of
wine
may
exhilarate
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
pouring
out
a
bumper
,
he
swallowed
it
at
a
draught
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
the
fond
fool
is
pining
for
her
husband
,
and
has
some
misgivings
about
him
.
<EOS>
Egad
!
<EOS>
it
is
well
for
her
<EOS>
she
does
not
know
what
has
really
taken
place
.
<EOS>
She
'll
learn
that
soon
enough
.
<EOS>
What
's
this
?
"
he
added
,
glancing
at
a
picture
on
the
wall
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
miniature
!
<EOS>
It
must
be
;
for
it
answers
exactly
to
Pillichody
's
description
.
<EOS>
A
sparkling
brunette
,
with
raven
hair
,
and
eyes
of
night
.
<EOS>
I
am
on
fire
to
behold
her
:
but
I
must
proceed
with
prudence
,
or
I
may
ruin
all
.
<EOS>
Is
there
nothing
of
Disbrowe
's
that
I
could
put
on
for
the
nonce
?
'
<EOS>
Fore
Heaven
!
<EOS>
the
very
thing
I
want
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
exclamation
was
occasioned
by
his
observing
a
loose
silken
robe
lying
across
a
chair
.
<EOS>
Wrapping
it
round
him
,
and
throwing
down
his
hat
,
he
took
the
lamp
and
went
up
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
Daring
as
he
was
,
Parravicin
felt
his
courage
desert
him
,
as
having
found
the
door
of
Mrs.
Disbrowe
's
chamber
,
he
cautiously
opened
it
.
<EOS>
A
single
glance
showed
him
that
the
room
was
more
exquisitely
,
more
luxuriously
furnished
than
that
he
had
just
quitted
.
<EOS>
Articles
of
feminine
attire
,
of
the
richest
kind
,
were
hung
against
the
walls
,
or
disposed
on
the
chairs
.
<EOS>
On
one
side
stood
the
toilette
-
table
,
with
its
small
mirror
then
in
vogue
,
and
all
its
equipage
of
silver
flasks
,
filligree
cassets
,
japan
patch
-
boxes
,
scent
-
bottles
,
and
pomatum
-
pots
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
entered
the
room
,
a
faint
voice
issuing
from
behind
the
rich
damask
curtains
of
the
bed
,
demanded
,
"
Is
it
you
,
Disbrowe
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
Margaret
,
"
replied
Parravicin
,
setting
down
the
lamp
,
and
speaking
with
a
handkerchief
at
his
mouth
,
to
disguise
his
voice
and
conceal
his
features
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
late
--
very
late
,
"
she
rejoined
,
"
and
I
have
been
ill
.
<EOS>
I
fancied
myself
dying
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
has
been
the
matter
with
you
sweet
,
Meg
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Parravicin
,
approaching
the
bed
,
and
seating
himself
behind
the
curtains
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
seized
with
a
dreadful
headache
about
an
hour
ago
.
<EOS>
It
has
left
me
;
but
I
have
a
strange
oppression
at
my
chest
,
and
breathe
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
alarm
me
,
my
love
,
"
rejoined
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
"
Were
you
ever
attacked
thus
before
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
Disbrowe
!
<EOS>
if
you
knew
how
I
have
longed
for
your
return
,
you
would
blame
yourself
for
your
absence
.
<EOS>
You
have
grown
sadly
neglectful
of
late
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
you
love
some
one
else
.
<EOS>
If
I
thought
so------
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
if
you
thought
so
,
Margaret
?
"
demanded
Parravicin
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Disbrowe
,
raising
herself
in
the
bed
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
requite
your
perfidy
--
terribly
requite
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
learn
that
Captain
Disbrowe
_
is
_
faithless
,
"
cried
Parravicin
,
throwing
back
the
curtains
,
and
disclosing
himself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Learn
that
he
loves
another
,
and
is
with
her
now
.
<EOS>
Learn
that
he
cares
so
little
for
you
,
that
he
has
surrendered
you
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
I
hear
?
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Disbrowe
.
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
,
and
what
brings
you
here
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
guess
my
errand
from
my
presence
,
"
replied
the
knight
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
called
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
,
and
am
the
most
devoted
of
your
admirers
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
husband
surrender
me
to
a
stranger
!
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
lady
,
distractedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
me
here
,
and
may
judge
of
the
truth
of
my
statement
,
"
rejoined
the
knight
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
husband
gave
me
this
key
,
with
which
I
introduced
myself
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
motive
could
he
have
for
such
unheard
-
of
baseness
--
<EOS>
such
barbarity
?
"
cried
Mrs.
Disbrowe
,
bursting
into
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
tell
you
,
madam
?
"
replied
Parravicin
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
tired
of
you
,
and
has
taken
this
means
of
ridding
himself
of
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Disbrowe
uttered
a
loud
scream
,
and
fell
back
in
the
bed
.
<EOS>
Parravicin
waited
for
a
moment
;
but
not
hearing
her
move
,
brought
the
lamp
to
see
what
was
the
matter
.
<EOS>
She
had
fainted
,
and
was
lying
across
the
pillow
,
with
her
night
-
dress
partly
open
,
so
as
to
expose
her
neck
and
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
The
knight
was
at
first
ravished
with
her
beauty
;
but
his
countenance
suddenly
fell
,
and
an
expression
of
horror
and
alarm
took
possession
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
appeared
rooted
to
the
spot
,
and
instead
of
attempting
to
render
her
any
assistance
,
remained
with
his
gaze
fixed
upon
her
neck
.
 
<EOS>
Rousing
himself
at
length
,
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
,
hurried
down
stairs
,
and
without
pausing
for
a
moment
,
threw
open
the
street
-
door
.
<EOS>
As
he
issued
from
it
,
his
throat
was
forcibly
griped
,
and
the
point
of
a
sword
was
placed
at
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
now
in
my
power
,
villain
,
"
cried
Disbrowe
,
"
and
shall
not
escape
my
vengeance
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
already
avenged
,
"
replied
Parravicin
,
shaking
off
his
assailant
.
"
<EOS>
Your
wife
has
the
plague
.
"
  
<EOS>
VII
.
 
<EOS>
THE
PLAGUE
NURSE
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
so
my
husband
has
got
the
plague
,
"
muttered
Mother
Malmayns
,
as
she
hastened
towards
Saint
Paul
's
,
after
the
reproof
she
had
received
from
Doctor
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
it
's
a
disorder
that
few
recover
from
,
and
I
do
n't
think
he
stands
a
better
chance
than
his
fellows
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
troubled
with
him
long
enough
.
<EOS>
I
've
borne
his
ill
-
usage
and
savage
temper
for
twenty
years
,
vainly
hoping
something
would
take
him
off
;
but
though
he
tried
his
constitution
hard
,
it
was
too
tough
to
yield
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
's
likely
to
go
now
.
<EOS>
If
I
find
him
better
than
I
expect
,
I
can
easily
make
all
sure
.
<EOS>
That
's
one
good
thing
about
the
plague
.
<EOS>
You
may
get
rid
of
a
patient
without
any
one
being
the
wiser
.
<EOS>
A
wrong
mixture
--
a
pillow
removed
--
a
moment
's
chill
during
the
fever
--
a
glass
of
cold
water
<EOS>
--
the
slightest
thing
will
do
it
.
<EOS>
Matthew
Malmayns
,
you
will
die
of
the
plague
,
that
's
certain
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
be
careful
how
I
proceed
.
<EOS>
That
cursed
doctor
has
his
eye
upon
me
.
<EOS>
As
luck
would
have
it
,
I
've
got
Sibbald
's
ointment
in
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
That
is
sure
to
do
its
business
--
and
safely
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
ruminating
,
she
shaped
her
course
towards
the
southwest
corner
of
the
cathedral
,
and
passing
under
the
shrouds
and
cloisters
of
the
Convocation
House
,
raised
the
latch
of
a
small
wooden
shed
fixed
in
the
angle
of
a
buttress
.
<EOS>
Evidently
well
acquainted
with
the
place
,
she
was
not
long
in
finding
a
lantern
and
materials
to
light
it
,
and
inserting
her
fingers
in
a
crevice
of
the
masonry
,
from
which
the
mortar
had
been
removed
,
she
drew
forth
a
key
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
has
not
been
stirred
since
I
left
it
here
a
month
ago
,
"
she
muttered
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
take
care
of
this
key
,
for
if
Matthew
_
should
_
die
,
I
may
not
be
able
to
enter
the
vaults
of
Saint
Faith
's
without
it
;
and
as
I
know
all
their
secret
places
and
passages
,
which
nobody
else
does
,
except
my
husband
,
I
can
make
them
a
storehouse
for
the
plunder
I
may
obtain
during
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
If
it
rages
for
a
year
,
or
only
half
that
time
,
and
increases
in
violence
(
as
God
grant
it
may
)
,
I
will
fill
every
hole
in
those
walls
with
gold
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
she
took
up
the
lantern
,
and
crept
along
the
side
of
the
cathedral
,
until
she
came
to
a
flight
of
stone
steps
.
<EOS>
Descending
them
,
she
unlocked
a
small
but
strong
door
,
cased
with
iron
,
and
fastening
it
after
her
,
proceeded
along
a
narrow
stone
passage
,
which
brought
her
to
another
door
,
opening
upon
the
south
aisle
of
Saint
Faith
's
.
 
<EOS>
Pausing
for
a
moment
to
listen
whether
any
one
was
within
the
sacred
structure
--
for
such
was
the
dead
and
awful
silence
of
the
place
,
that
the
slightest
whisper
or
footfall
,
even
at
its
farthest
extremity
,
could
be
distinguished
<EOS>
--
she
crossed
to
the
other
side
,
glancing
fearfully
around
her
as
she
threaded
the
ranks
of
pillars
,
whose
heavy
and
embrowned
shafts
her
lantern
feebly
illumined
,
and
entering
a
recess
,
took
a
small
stone
out
of
the
wall
,
and
deposited
the
chief
part
of
the
contents
of
her
pocket
behind
it
,
after
which
she
carefully
replaced
the
stone
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
she
hurried
to
the
charnel
,
and
softly
opened
the
door
of
the
crypt
.
 
<EOS>
Greatly
relieved
by
the
operation
he
had
undergone
,
the
sexton
had
sunk
into
a
slumber
,
and
was
,
therefore
,
unconscious
of
the
entrance
of
his
wife
,
who
,
setting
down
the
lantern
,
advanced
towards
the
pallet
.
<EOS>
His
mother
and
the
young
man
were
still
in
attendance
,
and
the
former
,
on
seeing
her
daughter
-
in
-
law
,
exclaimed
,
in
low
but
angry
accents--"What
brings
you
here
,
Judith
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
expected
to
find
my
son
dead
.
<EOS>
But
he
will
disappoint
you
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
said
he
would
recover
--
<EOS>
did
he
not
Kerrich
?
<EOS>
"
she
added
,
appealing
to
the
young
man
,
who
nodded
acquiescence
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
recover
,
I
tell
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
replied
Judith
,
in
the
blandest
tone
she
could
assume
;
"
I
hope
he
will
.
<EOS>
And
if
the
doctor
says
so
,
I
have
no
doubt
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
only
heard
of
his
illness
a
few
minutes
ago
,
and
came
instantly
to
nurse
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
You
_
nurse
him
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
old
woman
;
"
if
you
show
him
any
affection
now
,
it
will
be
for
the
first
time
since
your
wedding
-
day
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
long
has
he
been
unwell
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Judith
,
with
difficulty
repressing
her
anger
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
seized
the
night
before
last
,
"
replied
the
old
woman
;
"
but
he
did
n't
know
what
was
the
matter
with
him
when
it
began
.
<EOS>
I
saw
him
just
before
he
went
to
rest
,
and
he
complained
of
a
slight
illness
,
but
nothing
to
signify
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
passed
a
frightful
night
,
for
the
vergers
found
him
in
the
morning
running
about
Saint
Faith
's
like
a
madman
,
and
dashing
his
spades
and
mattocks
against
the
walls
and
pillars
.
<EOS>
They
secured
him
,
and
brought
him
here
,
and
on
examination
,
he
proved
to
have
the
plague
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
surprise
me
by
what
you
say
,
"
replied
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
During
the
last
month
,
I
have
nursed
more
than
a
dozen
patients
,
and
never
knew
any
of
them
so
violent
.
<EOS>
I
must
look
at
his
sore
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
doctor
has
just
dressed
it
,
"
observed
the
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mind
that
,
"
rejoined
Judith
,
turning
down
the
blanket
,
and
examining
her
husband
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
"
she
added
,
"
he
is
doing
as
well
as
possible
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
sha
n't
be
wanted
any
more
,
"
observed
Kerrich
,
"
<EOS>
now
you
're
come
back
to
nurse
your
husband
,
Mrs.
Malmayns
?
<EOS>
I
shall
be
glad
to
get
home
to
my
own
bed
,
for
I
do
n't
feel
well
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
alarm
yourself
,
"
replied
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
bottle
of
plague
vinegar
for
you
.
<EOS>
Dip
<EOS>
a
piece
of
linen
in
it
,
and
smell
at
it
,
and
<EOS>
I
'll
insure
you
against
the
pestilence
.
"
 
<EOS>
Kerrich
took
the
phial
,
and
departed
.
<EOS>
But
the
remedy
was
of
little
avail
.
<EOS>
Before
daybreak
,
he
was
seized
with
the
distemper
,
and
died
two
days
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
poor
Kerrich
has
n't
got
the
plague
?
"
said
the
old
woman
,
in
a
tremulous
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
he
has
,
"
replied
the
daughter
-
in
-
law
,
"
but
I
did
n't
like
to
alarm
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mercy
on
us
!
"
cried
the
other
,
getting
up
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
dreadful
scourge
it
is
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
say
so
,
if
you
had
seen
whole
families
swept
off
by
it
,
as
I
have
,
"
replied
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
mostly
attacks
old
persons
and
children
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Lord
help
us
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
crone
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
it
will
spare
me
.
<EOS>
I
thought
my
age
secured
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
the
reverse
,
"
replied
Judith
,
desirous
of
exciting
her
mother
-
in
-
law
's
terrors
;
"
quite
the
reverse
.
<EOS>
You
must
take
care
of
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
n't
think
I
'm
ill
,
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
other
,
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
and
let
me
look
at
you
,
"
returned
Judith
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
old
woman
tremblingly
obeyed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
what
do
you
think
of
me
--
what
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
as
her
daughter
-
in
-
law
eyed
her
for
some
minutes
in
silence
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
,
I
say
?
"
 
<EOS>
But
Judith
remained
silent
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
insist
upon
knowing
,
"
continued
the
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
able
to
bear
the
truth
?
<EOS>
"
returned
her
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
need
say
no
more
,
"
groaned
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
the
truth
must
be
,
and
will
try
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
get
home
as
fast
as
I
can
,
and
put
my
few
affairs
in
order
,
so
that
if
I
am
carried
off
,
I
may
not
go
unprepared
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
do
so
,
"
replied
her
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
take
care
of
my
poor
son
,
Judith
,
"
rejoined
the
old
woman
,
shedding
a
flood
of
tears
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
stay
with
him
,
if
I
thought
I
could
do
him
any
good
;
but
if
I
really
am
infected
,
I
might
only
be
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
neglect
him
--
as
you
hope
for
mercy
hereafter
,
do
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Make
yourself
easy
,
mother
,
"
replied
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
every
care
of
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
no
fears
of
the
disorder
yourself
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
None
whatever
,
"
replied
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
_
a
safe
woman
_
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
you
,
"
replied
her
mother
-
in
-
law
,
in
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
the
plague
,
"
replied
Judith
;
"
and
those
who
have
had
it
once
,
never
take
it
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
This
opinion
,
entertained
at
the
commencement
of
the
pestilence
,
it
may
be
incidentally
remarked
,
was
afterwards
found
to
be
entirely
erroneous
;
some
persons
being
known
to
have
the
distemper
three
or
four
times
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
never
let
us
know
you
were
ill
,
"
said
the
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
do
so
,
"
replied
Judith
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
I
should
have
done
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
I
was
nursing
two
sisters
at
a
small
house
in
Clerkenwell
Close
,
and
they
both
died
in
the
night
-
time
,
within
a
few
hours
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
,
as
I
was
preparing
to
leave
the
house
,
I
was
seized
myself
,
and
had
scarcely
strength
to
creep
up
-
stairs
to
bed
.
<EOS>
An
old
apothecary
,
named
Sibbald
,
who
had
brought
drugs
to
the
house
,
attended
me
,
and
saved
my
life
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
a
week
,
I
was
well
again
,
and
able
to
move
about
,
and
should
have
returned
home
,
but
the
apothecary
told
me
,
as
I
had
had
the
distemper
once
,
I
might
resume
my
occupation
with
safety
.
<EOS>
I
did
so
,
and
have
found
plenty
of
employment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
"
rejoined
the
old
woman
;
"
and
you
will
find
plenty
more
--
plenty
more
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
replied
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
do
not
give
utterance
to
such
a
dreadful
wish
,
Judith
,
"
rejoined
her
mother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
let
cupidity
steel
your
heart
to
every
better
feeling
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
slight
derisive
smile
passed
over
the
harsh
features
of
the
plague
-
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
heed
me
not
,
"
pursued
the
old
woman
.
"
<EOS>
But
a
time
will
come
when
you
will
recollect
my
words
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
content
to
wait
till
then
,
"
rejoined
Judith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
grant
you
a
better
frame
of
mind
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
take
one
last
look
of
my
son
,
for
it
is
not
likely
I
shall
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
in
this
world
,
"
thought
Judith
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
conjure
you
,
by
all
that
is
sacred
,
not
to
neglect
him
,
"
said
the
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
promised
to
do
so
,
"
replied
Judith
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
mother
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
a
long
good
-
night
to
me
,
I
fear
,
"
returned
the
dame
.
"
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
promised
to
send
some
blankets
and
medicine
for
poor
Matthew
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
is
a
charitable
man
to
the
poor
,
and
if
he
learns
I
am
sick
,
he
may
,
perhaps
,
call
and
give
me
advice
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
he
will
,
"
replied
Judith
.
"
<EOS>
Should
the
man
bring
the
blankets
,
I
will
tell
him
to
acquaint
his
master
with
your
condition
.
<EOS>
And
now
take
this
lantern
,
mother
,
and
get
home
as
fast
as
you
can
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
almost
pushed
her
out
of
the
vault
,
and
closed
the
door
after
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
last
I
am
rid
of
her
,
"
she
muttered
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
have
been
a
spy
over
me
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
frightened
her
into
the
plague
.
<EOS>
But
if
she
dies
of
fear
,
it
will
answer
my
purpose
as
well
.
<EOS>
And
now
for
my
husband
.
"
 
<EOS>
Taking
up
the
lamp
,
and
shading
it
with
her
hand
,
she
gazed
at
his
ghastly
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
slumbers
tranquilly
,
"
she
muttered
,
after
contemplating
him
for
some
time
,
adding
with
a
chuckling
laugh
,
"
it
would
be
a
pity
to
waken
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
seating
herself
on
a
stool
near
the
pallet
,
she
turned
over
in
her
mind
in
what
way
she
could
best
execute
her
diabolical
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
While
she
was
thus
occupied
,
the
messenger
from
Doctor
Hodges
arrived
with
a
bundle
of
blankets
and
several
phials
and
pots
of
ointment
.
<EOS>
The
man
offered
to
place
the
blankets
on
the
pallet
,
but
Judith
would
not
let
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
it
better
myself
,
and
without
disturbing
the
poor
sufferer
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Give
my
dutiful
thanks
to
your
master
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
my
husband
's
mother
,
old
widow
Malmayns
,
fancies
herself
attacked
by
the
plague
,
and
if
he
will
be
kind
enough
to
visit
her
,
she
lodges
in
the
upper
attic
of
a
baker
's
house
,
at
the
sign
of
the
Wheatsheaf
,
in
Little
Distaff
-
lane
,
hard
by
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
fail
to
deliver
your
message
to
the
doctor
,
"
replied
the
man
,
as
he
took
his
departure
.
 
<EOS>
Left
alone
with
her
husband
a
second
time
,
Judith
waited
till
she
thought
the
man
had
got
out
of
the
cathedral
,
and
then
rising
and
taking
the
lamp
,
she
repaired
to
the
charnel
,
to
make
sure
it
was
untenanted
.
<EOS>
Not
content
with
this
,
she
stole
out
into
Saint
Faith
's
,
and
gazing
round
as
far
as
the
feeble
light
of
her
lamp
would
permit
,
called
out
in
a
tone
that
even
startled
herself
,
"
<EOS>
Is
any
one
lurking
there
?
"
<EOS>
but
receiving
no
other
answer
than
was
afforded
by
the
deep
echoes
of
the
place
,
she
returned
to
the
vault
.
<EOS>
Just
as
she
reached
the
door
,
a
loud
cry
burst
upon
her
ear
,
and
rushing
forward
<EOS>
,
she
found
that
her
husband
had
wakened
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Malmayns
,
raising
himself
in
bed
,
as
he
perceived
her
,
"
are
you
come
back
again
,
<EOS>
you
she
-
devil
?
<EOS>
Where
is
my
mother
?
<EOS>
Where
is
Kerrich
?
<EOS>
What
have
you
done
with
them
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
have
both
got
the
plague
,
"
replied
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
They
caught
it
from
you
.
<EOS>
But
never
mind
them
.
<EOS>
I
will
watch
over
you
as
long
as
you
live
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
that
will
be
for
years
,
you
accursed
jade
,
"
replied
the
sexton
;
"
Dr.
Hodges
says
I
shall
recover
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
got
worse
since
he
left
you
,
"
replied
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
Lie
down
,
and
let
me
throw
these
blankets
over
you
.
"
 
"
Off
!
"
cried
the
sick
man
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
approach
me
.
<EOS>
You
want
to
smother
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
cure
you
,
"
replied
his
wife
,
heaping
the
blankets
upon
the
pallet
.
<EOS>
"
The
doctor
has
sent
some
ointment
for
your
sore
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
let
him
apply
it
himself
,
"
cried
Malmayns
,
shaking
his
fist
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
touch
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
strangle
you
if
you
come
near
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Matthew
,
"
replied
his
wife
,
"
I
have
had
the
plague
myself
,
and
know
how
to
treat
it
better
than
any
doctor
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
will
cure
you
,
if
you
will
let
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
faith
in
you
,
"
replied
Malmayns
,
"
but
I
suppose
I
must
submit
.
<EOS>
Take
heed
what
you
do
to
me
,
for
if
I
have
but
five
minutes
to
live
,
it
will
be
long
enough
to
revenge
myself
upon
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
anoint
your
sore
with
this
salve
,
"
rejoined
Judith
,
producing
a
pot
of
dark
-
coloured
ointment
,
and
rubbing
his
shoulder
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
given
me
by
Sibbald
,
the
apothecary
of
Clerkenwell
<EOS>
He
is
a
friend
of
Chowles
,
the
coffin
-
maker
.
<EOS>
You
know
Chowles
,
Matthew
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
him
for
as
great
a
rascal
as
ever
breathed
,
"
replied
her
husband
,
gruffly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
always
cheated
me
out
of
my
dues
,
and
his
coffins
are
the
worst
I
ever
put
under
ground
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
making
his
fortune
now
,
"
said
Judith
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
the
plague
,
eh
?
"
replied
Matthew
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
envy
him
.
<EOS>
Money
so
gained
wo
n't
stick
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
will
never
prosper
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
_
<EOS>
you
_
had
his
money
,
Matthew
,
"
replied
his
wife
,
in
a
coaxing
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
the
plague
had
n't
attacked
me
when
it
did
,
I
should
have
been
richer
than
Chowles
will
ever
be
,
"
replied
the
sexton,--"nay
,
I
am
richer
as
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
surprise
me
,
"
replied
Judith
,
suddenly
pausing
in
her
task
.
<EOS>
"
How
have
you
obtained
your
wealth
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
discovered
a
treasure
,
"
replied
,
the
sexton
,
with
a
mocking
laugh,--"a
secret
hoard
--
a
chest
of
gold
--
ha
!
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
--
where
?
"
demanded
his
wife
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
secret
,
"
replied
Matthew
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
it
from
him
before
he
dies
,
"
thought
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
Had
we
better
not
secure
it
without
delay
?
<EOS>
"
she
added
,
aloud
.
"
<EOS>
Some
other
person
may
find
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
safe
enough
,
"
replied
Matthew
.
<EOS>
"
It
has
remained
undiscovered
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
,
and
will
continue
so
for
a
hundred
to
come
,
unless
I
bring
it
forth
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
_
will
_
bring
it
forth
,
wo
n't
you
?
"
said
Judith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Undoubtedly
,
"
replied
Matthew
,
"
if
I
get
better
.
<EOS>
But
not
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Money
would
be
of
no
use
to
me
in
the
grave
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
it
would
be
of
use
to
_
me
_
,
"
replied
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
might
,
"
replied
the
sexton
;
"
but
if
I
die
,
the
knowledge
of
the
treasure
shall
die
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
deceiving
me
,
"
thought
Judith
,
beginning
to
rub
his
shoulder
afresh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
you
have
played
me
false
,
you
jade
,
"
cried
Malmayns
,
writhing
with
pain
.
<EOS>
"
The
stuff
you
have
applied
burns
like
caustic
,
and
eats
into
my
flesh
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
doing
its
duty
,
"
replied
his
wife
,
calmly
watching
his
agonies
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
soon
be
easier
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
shall
--
in
death
,
"
groaned
the
sufferer
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
parched
with
thirst
.
<EOS>
Give
me
a
glass
of
water
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
wine
,
Matthew
,
if
you
prefer
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
flask
in
my
pocket
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
of
the
treasure
--
where
is
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Peace
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
baulk
your
avaricious
hopes
.
<EOS>
You
shall
never
know
where
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
know
as
much
as
you
do
,
"
she
rejoined
,
in
a
tone
of
incredulity
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
you
tell
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
found
no
treasure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
this
is
the
last
word
I
shall
ever
utter
,
I
_
have
_
,
"
he
returned
;
--"a
<EOS>
mighty
treasure
.
<EOS>
But
you
shall
never
possess
it
--
<EOS>
never!--ah
!
ah
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
shall
you
have
the
wine
,
"
she
replied
;
"
there
is
water
for
you
,
<EOS>
"
she
added
,
handing
him
a
jug
,
which
he
drained
with
frantic
eagerness
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
a
dead
man
,
"
she
muttered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
chilled
to
the
heart
,
"
grasped
the
sexton
,
shivering
from
head
to
foot
,
while
chill
damps
gathered
on
his
brow
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
wrong
in
drinking
the
water
,
and
you
ought
not
to
have
given
it
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
asked
for
it
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
had
wine
but
for
your
obstinacy
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
save
you
yet
,
if
you
will
tell
me
where
to
find
the
treasure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Look
for
it
in
my
grave
,
"
he
returned
,
with
a
hideous
grin
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
he
fell
into
a
sort
of
stupor
.
<EOS>
His
wife
could
now
have
easily
put
a
period
to
his
existence
,
but
she
still
hoped
to
wrest
the
secret
from
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
assured
,
moreover
,
that
his
recovery
was
hopeless
.
<EOS>
At
the
expiration
of
about
two
hours
,
he
was
aroused
by
the
excruciating
anguish
of
his
sore
.
<EOS>
He
had
again
become
delirious
,
and
raved
as
before
about
coffins
,
corpses
,
graves
,
and
other
loathsome
matters
.
<EOS>
Seeing
,
from
his
altered
looks
and
the
livid
and
gangrenous
appearance
which
the
tumour
had
assumed
,
that
his
end
was
not
far
off
,
Judith
resolved
not
to
lose
a
moment
,
but
to
try
the
effect
of
a
sudden
surprise
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
she
bent
down
her
head
,
and
shouted
in
his
ear
,
"
What
has
become
of
your
treasure
,
Matthew
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
plan
succeeded
to
a
miracle
.
<EOS>
The
dying
man
instantly
raised
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
treasure
!
"
<EOS>
he
echoed
with
a
yell
that
made
the
vault
ring
again
.
"
<EOS>
Well
thought
on
!
<EOS>
I
have
not
secured
it
.
<EOS>
They
are
carrying
it
off
.
<EOS>
I
must
prevent
them
.
"
<EOS>
And
throwing
off
the
coverings
,
he
sprang
out
of
bed
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
it
now
,
"
thought
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
"
she
added,--"they
are
carrying
it
off
.
<EOS>
The
vergers
have
discovered
it
.
<EOS>
They
are
digging
it
up
.
<EOS>
We
must
instantly
prevent
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
!
"
shrieked
Malmayns
.
<EOS>
"
Bring
the
light
!
<EOS>
bring
the
light
!
"
<EOS>
And
bursting
open
the
door
,
he
rushed
into
the
adjoining
aisle
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
will
kill
himself
,
and
discover
the
treasure
into
the
bargain
,
"
cried
Judith
,
following
him
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
what
do
I
see
!
<EOS>
People
in
the
church
.
<EOS>
Curses
on
them
!
<EOS>
they
have
ruined
my
hopes
.

<EOS>
THE
MOSAICAL
RODS
.
 
<EOS>
In
pursuance
of
their
design
of
seeking
out
an
astrologer
,
Maurice
Wyvil
and
Lydyard
crossed
Cheapside
and
entered
Friday
-
street
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
proceeded
far
,
when
they
perceived
a
watchman
standing
beneath
a
porch
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
,
and
thinking
it
an
intimation
that
the
house
was
attacked
by
the
plague
,
they
hurried
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
,
and
called
to
the
watchman
to
inquire
whether
he
knew
where
Mr.
Lilly
lived
.
 
<EOS>
Ascertaining
that
the
house
they
sought
was
only
a
short
distance
off
,
they
repaired
thither
,
and
knocking
at
the
door
,
<EOS>
a
small
wicket
,
protected
by
a
grating
,
was
open
within
it
,
and
a
sharp
female
voice
inquired
their
business
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
this
to
your
master
,
sweetheart
,
"
replied
Wyvil
,
slipping
a
purse
through
the
grating
;
"
and
tell
him
that
two
gentlemen
desire
to
consult
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
engaged
just
now
,
"
replied
the
woman
,
in
a
much
softer
tone
;
"
but
I
will
take
your
message
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
more
money
than
wit
,
"
laughed
Lydyard
.
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
kept
back
your
fee
till
you
had
got
the
information
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
I
should
never
have
received
any
,
"
replied
Wyvil
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
taken
the
surest
means
of
obtaining
admission
to
the
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
the
door
was
unbolted
by
the
woman
,
who
proved
to
be
young
and
rather
pretty
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
light
in
her
hand
,
and
directing
them
to
follow
her
,
led
the
way
to
a
sort
of
anteroom
,
divided
,
as
it
appeared
,
from
a
larger
room
by
a
thick
black
curtain
.
<EOS>
Drawing
aside
the
drapery
,
their
conductress
ushered
them
into
the
presence
of
three
individuals
,
who
were
seated
at
a
table
strewn
with
papers
,
most
of
which
were
covered
with
diagrams
and
,
astrological
calculations
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
these
persons
immediately
rose
on
their
appearance
,
and
gravely
but
courteously
saluted
them
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
man
,
somewhat
advanced
in
life
,
being
then
about
sixty
-
three
,
with
an
aquiline
nose
,
dark
eyes
,
not
yet
robbed
of
their
lustre
,
grey
hair
waving
over
his
shoulders
,
and
a
pointed
beard
and
moustache
.
<EOS>
The
general
expression
of
his
countenance
was
shrewd
and
penetrating
,
and
yet
there
were
certain
indications
of
credulity
about
it
,
showing
that
he
was
as
likely
to
be
imposed
upon
himself
as
to
delude
others
.
<EOS>
It
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
that
this
way
Lilly
.
 
<EOS>
The
person
on
his
right
,
whose
name
was
John
Booker
,
and
who
,
like
himself
,
was
a
proficient
in
astrology
,
was
so
buried
in
calculation
,
that
he
did
not
raise
his
eyes
from
the
paper
on
the
approach
of
the
strangers
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
stout
man
,
with
homely
but
thoughtful
features
,
and
though
not
more
than
a
year
older
than
Lilly
,
looked
considerably
his
senior
.
<EOS>
With
the
exception
of
a
few
silver
curls
hanging
down
the
back
of
his
neck
,
he
was
completely
bald
;
but
his
massive
and
towering
brow
seemed
to
indicate
the
possession
of
no
ordinary
intellectual
qualities
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
native
of
Manchester
,
and
was
born
in
1601
,
of
a
good
family
.
"
<EOS>
His
excellent
verses
upon
the
twelve
months
,
"
says
Lilly
,
in
his
autobiography
,
"
framed
according
to
the
configurations
of
each
month
,
being
blessed
with
success
according
to
his
predictions
,
procured
him
much
reputation
all
over
England
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
very
honest
man
,
"
continues
the
same
authority
;
"
abhorred
any
deceit
in
the
art
he
studied
;
had
a
curious
fancy
in
judging
of
thefts
;
and
was
successful
in
resolving
love
-
questions
.
<EOS>
He
was
no
mean
proficient
in
astronomy
;
understood
much
in
physic
!
<EOS>
was
a
great
admirer
of
the
antimonial
cup
;
and
not
unlearned
in
chemistry
,
which
he
loved
well
,
but
did
not
practise
.
<EOS>
"
At
the
period
of
this
history
,
he
was
clerk
to
Sir
Hugh
Hammersley
,
alderman
.
 
<EOS>
The
third
person,--a
minor
canon
of
Saint
Paul
's
,
named
Thomas
Quatremain,--was
a
grave
,
sallow
-
complexioned
man
,
with
a
morose
and
repulsive
physiognomy
.
<EOS>
He
was
habited
in
the
cassock
of
a
churchman
of
the
period
,
and
his
black
velvet
cap
lay
beside
him
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
Like
Booker
,
he
was
buried
in
calculations
,
and
though
he
looked
up
for
a
moment
as
the
others
entered
the
room
,
he
instantly
resumed
his
task
,
without
regard
to
their
presence
.
 
<EOS>
After
looking
earnestly
at
his
visitors
for
a
few
moments
,
and
appearing
to
study
their
features
,
Lilly
motioned
them
to
be
seated
;
but
they
declined
the
offer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
come
to
take
up
your
time
,
Mr.
Lilly
,
"
said
Wyvil
,
"
but
simply
to
ask
your
judgment
in
a
matter
in
which
I
am
much
interested
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
First
permit
me
to
return
you
your
purse
,
sir
,
since
it
is
from
you
,
I
presume
,
that
I
received
it
,
"
replied
the
astrologer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
information
that
I
can
give
deserves
so
large
a
reward
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Wyvil
would
have
remonstrated
.
<EOS>
But
seeing
the
other
resolute
,
he
was
fain
to
concede
the
point
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
question
do
you
desire
to
have
resolved
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
pursued
Lilly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
be
fortunate
in
my
hopes
?
"
rejoined
Wyvil
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
a
little
more
precise
,
"
returned
the
astrologer
.
<EOS>
"
To
what
do
your
hopes
relate?--to
wealth
,
dignity
,
or
love
?
"
 
"
To
the
latter
,
"
replied
Wyvil
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
inferred
from
your
appearance
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Lilly
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
Venus
was
strong
in
your
nativity
,
though
well
-
dignified
;
and
I
should
,
therefore
,
say
you
were
not
unfrequently
entangled
in
love
affairs
.
<EOS>
Your
inamorata
,
I
presume
,
is
young
,
perhaps
fair,--blue
-
eyed
,
brown
-
haired
,
tall
,
slender
,
and
yet
perfectly
proportioned
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
all
you
describe
,
"
replied
Wyvil
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
she
of
your
own
rank
?
"
asked
Lilly
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Scarcely
so
,
"
replied
Wyvil
,
hesitating
before
he
answered
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
instantly
erect
a
scheme
,
"
replied
the
astrologer
,
rapidly
tracing
a
figure
on
a
sheet
of
paper
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
question
refers
to
the
seventh
house
.
<EOS>
I
shall
take
Venus
as
the
natural
significatrix
of
the
lady
.
<EOS>
The
moon
is
in
trine
with
the
lord
of
the
ascendant,--so
far
,
good
;
but
there
is
a
cross
aspect
from
Mars
,
who
darts
forth
malicious
rays
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Your
suit
will
probably
be
thwarted
.
<EOS>
But
what
Mars
bindeth
,
Venus
dissolveth
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
wholly
hopeless
.
<EOS>
I
should
recommend
you
to
persevere
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Juggler
!
"
exclaimed
"
Wyvil
between
his
teeth
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
no
juggler
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Lilly
,
angrily
;
"
and
to
prove
I
am
not
<EOS>
,
I
will
tell
you
who
you
are
who
thus
insult
me
,
though
you
have
not
announced
yourself
,
and
are
desirous
of
preserving
your
_
incognito
_
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
and
your
companion
is
Sir
George
Etherege
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Fore
heaven
!
<EOS>
we
are
discovered
,
"
cried
the
earl
;
"
but
whether
by
art
,
magic
,
or
from
previous
acquaintance
with
our
features
,
I
pretend
not
to
determine
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
either
case
,
my
lord,--for
<EOS>
it
is
useless
,
since
you
have
avowed
yourself
,
to
address
you
longer
as
Wyvil
,
"
replied
<EOS>
Etherege,--"you
owe
Mr.
Lilly
an
apology
for
the
insult
you
have
offered
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
undeserved
as
uncalled
for
;
for
he
described
your
position
with
Amabel
exactly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
what
I
said
,
"
replied
the
earl
,
with
great
frankness
,
"
and
entreat
Mr.
Lilly
to
overlook
it
,
and
impute
it
to
its
real
cause,--disappointment
at
his
judgment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
give
you
better
hopes
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Lilly
;
"
but
I
readily
accept
your
apology
.
<EOS>
Have
you
any
further
questions
to
ask
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
to
-
night
,
"
replied
the
earl
;
"
except
that
I
would
gladly
learn
whether
it
is
your
opinion
that
the
plague
will
extend
its
ravages
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
extend
them
so
far
,
my
lord
,
that
there
shall
neither
be
buriers
for
the
dead
,
nor
sound
to
look
after
the
sick
,
"
replied
Lilly
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
have
seen
a
little
tract
of
mine
published
in
1651,--some
fourteen
years
<EOS>
ago,--called
'
<EOS>
_
Monarchy
or
No
Monarchy
in
England
_
,
'
in
which
,
by
an
hieroglyphic
,
I
foretold
this
terrible
calamity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
heard
his
majesty
speak
of
the
book
no
later
than
yesterday
,
"
replied
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
He
has
the
highest
opinion
of
your
skill
,
Mr.
Lilly
,
as
he
can
not
blind
himself
to
the
fact
that
you
foretold
his
father
's
death
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
not
the
only
visitation
with
which
you
threaten
our
devoted
city
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
threatened
by
Heaven
,
not
by
me
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Lilly
.
"
<EOS>
London
will
be
devoured
by
plague
and
consumed
by
fire
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
our
time
?
"
asked
Etherege
.
 
<EOS>
"
Before
two
years
have
passed
over
our
heads
,
"
returned
the
astrologer
.
<EOS>
"
The
pestilence
originated
in
the
conjunction
of
Saturn
and
Jupiter
in
Sagittarius
,
on
the
10th
of
last
October
,
and
the
conjunction
of
Saturn
and
Mars
in
the
same
sign
,
on
the
12th
of
November
.
<EOS>
It
was
harbingered
also
by
the
terrible
comet
of
January
,
which
appeared
in
a
cadent
and
obscure
house
,
denoting
sickness
and
death
:
and
another
and
yet
more
terrible
comet
,
which
will
be
found
in
the
fiery
triplicity
of
Aries
,
Leo
,
and
Sagittarius
,
will
be
seen
before
the
conflagration
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
calculations
are
,
that
the
plague
will
be
at
its
worst
in
August
and
September
,
and
will
not
cease
entirely
till
the
beginning
of
December
,
"
observed
Booker
,
laying
aside
his
pen
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
doubt
not
you
are
right
,
sir
,
"
said
Lilly
,
"
for
your
calculations
are
ever
most
exact
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
labour
is
not
thrown
away
,
Mr.
Lilly
,
"
cried
Quatremain
,
who
had
finished
his
task
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
discovered
what
I
have
long
suspected
,
that
treasure
<EOS>
_
is
_
hidden
in
Saint
Paul
's
Cathedral
.
<EOS>
Mercury
is
posited
in
the
north
angle
of
the
fourth
house
;
the
dragon
's
tail
is
likewise
within
it
;
and
as
Sol
is
the
significator
,
it
must
be
gold
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
replied
Lilly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Furthermore
,
"
proceeded
Quatremain
,
"
as
the
sign
is
earthy
,
the
treasure
must
be
buried
in
the
vaults
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Undoubtedly
,
"
replied
Booker
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
all
impatience
to
search
for
it
,
"
said
Quatremain
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
there
at
once
,
and
make
trial
of
the
mosaical
rods
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
With
all
my
heart
,
"
replied
Lilly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
lord
,
"
he
added
to
Rochester
,
"
I
must
pray
you
to
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
heard
what
claims
my
attention
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
returned
the
earl
,
"
and
should
like
to
accompany
you
in
the
quest
,
if
you
will
permit
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
address
yourself
to
Mr.
Quatremain
,
"
rejoined
Lilly
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
consents
,
I
can
make
no
objection
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
minor
canon
,
on
being
appealed
to
,
signified
his
acquiescence
,
and
after
some
slight
preparation
,
Lilly
produced
two
hazel
rods
,
and
the
party
set
out
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
'
walking
brought
them
to
the
northern
entrance
of
the
cathedral
,
where
they
speedily
aroused
the
poor
verger
,
who
began
to
fancy
<EOS>
he
was
to
have
no
rest
that
night
.
<EOS>
On
learning
their
purpose
,
however
,
he
displayed
the
utmost
alacrity
,
and
by
Quatremain
's
directions
went
in
search
of
his
brother
-
verger
,
and
a
mason
,
who
,
being
employed
at
the
time
in
making
repairs
in
the
chantries
,
lodged
within
the
cathedral
.
 
<EOS>
This
occasioned
a
delay
of
a
few
minutes
,
during
which
Rochester
and
Etherege
had
an
opportunity
,
like
that
enjoyed
a
short
time
before
by
Leonard
Holt
,
of
beholding
the
magnificent
effect
of
the
columned
aisles
by
moonlight
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
other
verger
,
who
was
a
young
and
active
man
,
and
the
mason
,
arrived
,
and
mattocks
,
spades
,
and
an
iron
bar
being
procured
,
and
a
couple
of
torches
lighted
,
they
descended
to
Saint
Faith
's
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
more
picturesque
can
be
conceived
than
the
effect
of
the
torchlight
on
the
massive
pillars
and
low
-
browed
roof
of
the
subterranean
church
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
the
figures
inappropriate
to
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Lilly
,
with
the
mosaical
rods
in
his
hand
,
which
he
held
at
a
short
distance
from
the
floor
,
moving
first
to
one
point
,
then
to
another
;
now
lingering
within
the
gloomy
nave
,
now
within
the
gloomier
aisles
;
the
grave
minor
canon
,
who
kept
close
beside
him
,
and
watched
his
movements
with
the
most
intense
anxiety
;
Booker
,
with
his
venerable
head
uncovered
,
and
his
bald
brow
reflecting
the
gleam
of
the
torches
;
the
two
court
gallants
in
their
rich
attire
;
and
the
vergers
and
their
comrade
,
armed
with
the
implements
for
digging;--all
constituted
a
striking
picture
.
<EOS>
And
as
Rochester
stepped
aside
to
gaze
at
it
,
he
thought
he
had
never
beheld
a
more
singular
scene
.
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
no
success
had
attended
the
searchers
.
<EOS>
The
mosaical
rods
had
continued
motionless
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
Lilly
reached
a
part
of
the
wall
where
a
door
appeared
to
have
been
stopped
up
,
and
playing
the
rods
near
it
,
they
turned
one
over
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
treasure
is
here
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
hidden
beneath
this
flag
.
"
 
<EOS>
Instantly
,
all
were
in
action
.
<EOS>
Quatremain
called
to
his
assistants
to
bring
their
mattocks
and
the
iron
bar
.
<EOS>
Rochester
ran
up
and
tendered
his
aid
;
Etherege
did
the
same
;
and
in
a
few
moments
the
flag
was
forced
from
its
position
.
 
<EOS>
On
examination
,
it
seemed
as
if
the
ground
beneath
it
had
been
recently
disturbed
,
though
it
was
carefully
trodden
down
.
<EOS>
But
without
stopping
to
investigate
the
matter
,
the
mason
and
the
younger
verger
commenced
digging
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
tired
,
Lilly
and
Quatremain
took
their
places
,
and
in
less
than
an
hour
they
had
got
to
the
depth
of
upwards
of
four
feet
.
<EOS>
Still
nothing
had
been
found
,
and
Lilly
was
just
about
to
relinquish
his
spade
to
the
mason
,
<EOS>
when
,
plunging
it
more
deeply
into
the
ground
,
it
struck
against
some
hard
substance
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
here
--
we
have
it
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
renewing
his
exertions
.
 
<EOS>
Seconded
by
Quatremain
,
they
soon
cleared
off
the
soil
,
and
came
to
what
appeared
to
be
a
coffin
or
a
large
chest
.
<EOS>
Both
then
got
out
of
the
pit
to
consider
how
they
should
remove
the
chest
;
the
whole
party
were
discussing
the
matter
,
when
a
tremendous
crash
,
succeeded
by
a
terrific
yell
,
was
heard
at
the
other
end
of
the
church
,
and
a
ghastly
and
half
-
naked
figure
,
looking
like
a
corpse
broken
from
the
tomb
,
rushed
forward
with
lightning
swiftness
,
and
shrieking--"My
treasure!--my
treasure!--you
shall
not
have
it!"--thrust
aside
the
group
,
and
plunged
into
the
excavation
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
bystanders
recovered
sufficient
courage
to
drag
the
unfortunate
sexton
out
of
the
pit
,
they
found
him
quite
dead
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
THE
MINIATURE
.
 
<EOS>
According
to
his
promise
,
Doctor
Hodges
visited
the
grocer
's
house
early
on
the
following
day
,
and
the
favourable
opinion
he
had
expressed
respecting
Stephen
Bloundel
was
confirmed
by
the
youth
's
appearance
.
<EOS>
The
pustule
had
greatly
increased
in
size
;
but
this
the
doctor
looked
upon
as
a
good
sign
:
and
after
applying
fresh
poultices
,
and
administering
a
hot
posset
-
drink
,
he
covered
the
patient
with
blankets
,
and
recommending
as
much
tranquillity
as
possible
,
he
proceeded
,
at
Bloundel
's
request
,
to
ascertain
the
state
of
health
of
the
rest
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
that
all
the
household
(
including
Blaize
,
who
,
being
a
little
out
of
order
from
the
quantity
of
medicine
he
had
swallowed
,
kept
his
bed
)
<EOS>
were
uninfected
,
he
went
upstairs
,
and
finding
the
two
boys
quite
well
,
and
playing
with
their
little
sister
Christiana
,
in
the
happy
unconsciousness
of
childhood
,
he
tapped
at
the
door
of
Mrs.
Bloundel
's
chamber
,
and
was
instantly
admitted
.
<EOS>
Amabel
did
not
raise
her
eyes
at
his
entrance
,
but
continued
the
employment
on
which
she
was
engaged
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
,
however
,
overwhelmed
him
with
inquiries
as
to
the
sufferer
,
and
entreated
him
to
prevail
upon
her
husband
to
let
her
take
his
place
at
the
sick
bed
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
accede
to
your
request
,
madam
,
"
replied
Hodges
;
"
because
I
think
the
present
arrangement
the
best
that
could
be
adopted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
am
I
not
to
see
poor
Stephen
again
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
bursting
into
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
soon
see
him
again
,
and
not
lose
sight
of
him
for
many
years
to
come
,
"
replied
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
I
can
judge
,
the
danger
is
over
,
and
,
aided
by
your
husband
's
care
and
watchfulness
,
I
have
little
doubt
of
bringing
the
youth
round
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
reconcile
me
to
the
deprivation
,
doctor
,
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Bloundel
;
"
but
can
you
insure
my
husband
against
the
distemper
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
insure
no
one
against
contagion
,
"
replied
Hodges
;
"
but
there
is
much
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
He
has
no
fear
,
and
takes
every
needful
precaution
.
<EOS>
You
must
hope
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
right
to
tell
you
,
that
you
will
be
separated
from
him
for
a
month
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Separated
from
my
husband
for
a
month
,
doctor
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
him
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
of
importance
to
say
to
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
point
of
the
conversation
Amabel
for
the
first
time
looked
up
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
red
and
inflamed
with
weeping
,
and
her
looks
betrayed
great
internal
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
see
my
father
,
mother
,
"
she
said
in
a
broken
and
supplicatory
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
she
can
write
to
him
,
or
send
a
message
by
me
,
"
rejoined
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
deliver
it
when
I
go
downstairs
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
my
mother
has
to
say
can
not
be
confided
to
a
third
party
,
sir
,
"
returned
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Better
defer
it
,
then
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
who
,
as
he
looked
hard
at
her
,
and
saw
the
colour
mount
to
her
cheeks
,
began
to
suspect
something
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
Whatever
you
have
to
say
,
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
may
be
very
well
delayed
;
for
the
house
is
now
closed
,
with
a
watchman
at
the
door
,
and
will
continue
so
for
a
month
to
come
.
<EOS>
No
one
can
quit
it
,
except
members
of
our
profession
,
searchers
,
nurses
,
and
other
authorized
persons
,
during
that
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
can
no
one
enter
it
,
do
you
think
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
one
would
desire
to
do
so
<EOS>
,
I
should
conceive
,
except
a
lover
,
"
replied
Hodges
,
with
a
sly
look
at
Amabel
,
who
instantly
averted
her
gaze
.
<EOS>
"
Where
a
pretty
girl
is
concerned
,
the
plague
itself
has
no
terrors
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Precisely
my
opinion
,
doctor
,
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Bloundel
;
"
and
as
I
can
not
consult
my
husband
,
perhaps
you
will
favour
me
with
your
advice
as
to
how
I
ought
to
act
,
if
such
a
person
as
you
describe
should
get
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
seldom
meddle
with
family
matters
,
"
rejoined
Hodges
;
"
but
I
feel
so
much
interest
in
all
that
relates
to
Mr.
Bloundel
,
that
I
am
induced
to
depart
from
my
rule
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
It
is
evident
you
have
lost
your
heart
,
"
he
added
,
to
Amabel
,
whose
blushes
told
him
he
was
right
;
"
but
not
,
I
hope
,
to
one
of
those
worthless
court
-
gallants
,
who
,
as
I
learn
from
common
report
,
are
in
the
habit
of
toasting
you
daily
.
<EOS>
If
it
is
so
,
you
must
subdue
your
passion
;
for
it
can
not
lead
to
good
.
<EOS>
Be
not
dazzled
by
a
brilliant
exterior
,
which
often
conceals
a
treacherous
heart
;
but
try
to
fix
your
affections
on
some
person
of
little
pretension
,
but
of
solid
worth
.
<EOS>
Never
,
I
grieve
to
say
,
was
there
a
season
when
such
universal
profligacy
prevailed
as
at
present
.
<EOS>
Never
was
it
so
necessary
for
a
young
maiden
,
possessed
of
beauty
like
yours
,
to
act
with
discretion
.
<EOS>
Never
was
a
court
so
licentious
as
that
of
our
sovereign
,
Charles
the
Second
,
whose
corrupt
example
is
imitated
by
every
one
around
him
,
while
its
baneful
influence
extends
to
all
classes
.
<EOS>
Were
I
to
echo
the
language
of
the
preachers
,
I
should
say
it
was
owing
to
the
wickedness
and
immorality
of
the
times
that
this
dreadful
judgment
of
the
plague
has
been
inflicted
upon
us
;
but
I
merely
bring
it
forward
as
an
argument
to
prove
to
you
,
Amabel
,
that
if
you
would
escape
the
moral
contagion
by
which
you
are
threatened
,
you
must
put
the
strictest
guard
upon
your
conduct
.
"
 
<EOS>
Amabel
faintly
murmured
her
thanks
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
speak
as
my
husband
himself
would
have
spoken
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
we
little
thought
,
when
we
prayed
that
the
pestilence
might
be
averted
from
us
,
that
a
worse
calamity
was
behind
,
and
that
one
of
the
most
profligate
of
the
courtiers
you
have
mentioned
would
find
his
way
to
our
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
One
of
the
most
profligate
of
them
?
"
cried
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
Who
,
in
Heaven
's
name
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
calls
himself
Maurice
Wyvil
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
of
such
a
person
,
"
rejoined
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
an
assumed
name
.
<EOS>
Have
you
no
letter
or
token
that
might
lead
to
his
discovery
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
turning
to
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
his
portrait
,
"
she
replied
,
drawing
a
small
miniature
from
her
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
I
have
seen
this
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
slightly
starting
as
he
cast
his
eyes
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
is
not
too
late
to
save
you
,
Amabel
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
severe
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
are
free
from
contamination
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
I
live
,
I
am
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
recognise
the
likeness
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
returned
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
portrait
of
one
whose
vices
and
depravity
are
the
town
's
cry
,
and
whose
name
coupled
with
that
of
a
woman
,
is
sufficient
to
sully
her
reputation
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
guessed
aright
,
"
replied
the
doctor
;
"
it
is
.
"
 
<EOS>
Uttering
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
terror
,
Amabel
fell
back
in
her
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
must
be
that
wicked
nobleman
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
Would
you
believe
it
,
doctor
,
that
he
forced
himself
into
the
house
--
nay
,
into
this
room
--
last
night
,
and
would
have
carried
off
my
daughter
,
in
spite
of
her
resistance
,
if
I
had
not
prevented
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
believe
anything
of
him
,
"
replied
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
But
your
husband
,
of
course
,
knows
nothing
of
the
matter
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
as
yet
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Bloundel
;
"
but
I
authorize
you
to
tell
him
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
dear
mother
,
"
cried
Amabel
,
flinging
herself
on
her
knees
before
her
,
"
I
implore
you
not
to
add
to
my
father
's
present
distress
.
<EOS>
I
might
not
have
been
able
to
conquer
my
attachment
to
Maurice
Wyvil
,
but
now
that
I
find
he
is
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
I
regard
him
with
abhorrence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
could
believe
you
sincere
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
"
I
might
be
induced
to
spare
your
father
the
pain
which
the
knowledge
of
this
unfortunate
affair
would
necessarily
inflict
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sincere,--indeed
<EOS>
I
am
,
"
replied
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
prove
that
the
earl
could
not
have
had
honourable
intentions
towards
you
,
Amabel
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
"
I
may
mention
that
he
is
at
this
moment
urging
his
suit
with
Mistress
Mallet,--a
young
heiress
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
Amabel
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
in
attendance
upon
Mistress
Stewart
,
the
king
's
present
favourite
,
the
day
before
yesterday
,
"
continued
Hodges
,
"
and
heard
his
majesty
entreat
her
to
use
her
influence
with
Mistress
Mallet
in
Rochester
's
behalf
.
<EOS>
After
this
,
you
can
not
doubt
the
nature
of
his
intentions
towards
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
cannot
--
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
"
rejoined
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
perfidy
itself
.
<EOS>
But
is
Mistress
Mallet
very
beautiful
,
doctor
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
beautiful
,
and
very
rich
,
"
he
replied
,
"
and
the
earl
is
desperately
in
love
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
heard
him
declare
laughingly
to
the
king
,
that
if
she
would
not
consent
to
marry
him
,
he
would
carry
her
off
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Just
what
he
said
to
me
,
"
exclaimed
Amabel--"perjured
and
faithless
that
he
is
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Harp
on
that
string
,
doctor
,
"
whispered
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
You
understand
her
feelings
exactly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Strangely
enough
,
"
pursued
the
doctor
,
who
,
having
carefully
examined
the
miniature
,
had
opened
the
back
of
the
case
,
and
could
not
repress
a
smile
at
what
he
beheld--"strangely
enough
,
this
very
picture
will
convince
you
of
the
earl
's
inconstancy
.
<EOS>
It
was
evidently
designed
for
Mistress
Mallet
,
and
,
as
she
would
not
accept
it
,
transferred
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
this
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Amabel
,
in
a
mortified
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
what
is
written
within
it
,
"
answered
Hodges
,
laying
the
open
case
before
her
,
and
reading
as
follows
:
"
'
<EOS>
To
the
sole
possessor
of
his
heart
,
the
fair
Mistress
Mallet
,
this
portrait
is
offered
by
her
devoted
slave
--
ROCHESTER
.
'
'
<EOS>
The
_
sole
_
possessor
of
his
heart
!
'
<EOS>
So
you
have
no
share
in
it
<EOS>
,
you
perceive
,
Amabel
.
'
<EOS>
Her
devoted
slave
!
'
<EOS>
Is
he
your
slave
likewise
?
<EOS>
Ha
!
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
<EOS>
_
is
_
<EOS>
his
writing
,
"
cried
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
note
,
"
she
added
,
producing
a
billet
,
"
is
in
the
same
hand
.
<EOS>
My
eyes
are
indeed
open
to
his
treachery
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
replied
Hodges
,
"
and
if
I
can
preserve
you
from
the
snares
of
this
noble
libertine
,
I
shall
rejoice
as
much
as
in
curing
your
brother
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
But
can
you
rely
upon
yourself
,
in
case
the
earl
should
make
another
attempt
to
see
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
"
she
averred
confidently
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
there
is
nothing
to
apprehend
,
"
rejoined
Hodges
;
"
and
I
think
it
better
on
many
accounts
not
to
mention
the
subject
to
your
father
.
<EOS>
It
would
only
distract
his
mind
,
and
prevent
him
from
duly
discharging
the
painful
task
he
has
undertaken
.
<EOS>
Were
I
in
your
place
,
<EOS>
Amabel
,
I
would
not
only
forget
my
present
perfidious
lover
,
but
would
instantly
bestow
my
affections
on
some
worthy
person
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
gladden
me
if
she
would
do
so
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
your
father
's
apprentice
,
Leonard
Holt
,
a
good
-
looking
,
well
-
grown
lad
,
"
pursued
the
doctor
;
"
and
I
much
mistake
if
he
is
insensible
to
your
attractions
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
he
loves
her
dearly
,
doctor
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
as
well
-
principled
as
well
-
looking
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
had
a
fault
to
find
with
him
since
he
came
to
live
with
us
.
<EOS>
It
will
rejoice
me
,
and
I
am
sure
would
not
displease
my
husband
,
to
see
our
child
united
to
Leonard
Holt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
what
say
you
,
Amabel
?
"
asked
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
Can
you
give
him
a
hope
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
,
no
!
"
replied
Amabel
;
"
I
have
been
deceived
once
,
but
I
will
not
be
deceived
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
I
will
never
we
d
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
every
woman
says
after
her
first
disappointment
,
"
observed
Hodges
;
"
but
not
one
in
ten
adheres
to
the
resolution
.
<EOS>
When
you
become
calmer
,
I
would
recommend
you
to
think
seriously
of
Leonard
Holt
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
a
tap
was
heard
at
the
door
,
and
opening
it
,
the
doctor
beheld
the
person
in
question
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
nothing
is
amiss
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
whatever
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
"
but
my
master
wishes
to
see
you
before
you
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
him
at
once
,
"
replied
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
day
,
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
Take
care
of
your
daughter
,
and
I
hope
she
will
take
care
of
herself
.
<EOS>
We
have
been
talking
about
you
,
young
man
,
"
he
added
in
a
low
tone
to
the
apprentice
,
"
and
I
have
recommended
you
as
a
husband
to
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
time
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
emotion
,
"
when
I
hoped
it
might
be
so
,
but
that
time
is
past
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
such
thing
,
"
replied
the
doctor
.
"
<EOS>
Now
is
the
time
to
make
an
impression
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
is
on
the
rebound
.
<EOS>
She
is
satisfied
of
her
lover
's
treachery
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
is
on
your
side
.
<EOS>
Do
not
neglect
the
present
opportunity
,
for
another
may
not
arrive
.
<EOS>
"
With
this
he
pushed
Leonard
into
the
room
,
and
,
shutting
the
door
upon
him
,
hurried
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
arrived
at
a
seasonable
juncture
,
Leonard
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
noticing
the
apprentice
's
perplexity
,
and
anxious
to
relieve
it
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
just
discovered
that
the
person
calling
himself
Maurice
Wyvil
is
no
other
than
the
Earl
of
Rochester
.
"
 
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
But
this
is
not
all
.
<EOS>
Amabel
has
promised
to
forget
him
,
and
I
have
urged
her
to
think
of
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Amabel
,
"
said
Leonard
,
advancing
towards
her
,
and
taking
her
hand
,
"
I
can
scarcely
credit
what
I
hear
.
<EOS>
Will
you
confirm
your
mother
's
words
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Leonard
,
"
returned
Amabel
,
"
I
am
not
insensible
to
your
good
qualities
,
and
no
one
can
more
truly
esteem
you
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
till
I
unfortunately
saw
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
whom
I
knew
not
as
such
,
I
might
have
loved
you
.
<EOS>
But
now
I
can
not
call
my
heart
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
affection
you
deserve
to
bestow
upon
you
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
obliterate
this
treacherous
man
's
image
from
my
memory
--
and
Heaven
,
I
trust
,
will
give
me
strength
to
do
so
--
I
will
strive
to
replace
it
with
your
own
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
all
I
ask
,
"
cried
Leonard
,
dropping
on
his
knee
before
her
,
and
pressing
his
lips
to
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
would
make
me
happier
than
to
see
you
united
,
my
children
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
bending
affectionately
over
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
would
do
anything
to
make
you
happy
,
<EOS>
dear
mother
,
"
replied
Amabel
,
gently
withdrawing
her
hand
,
from
that
of
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Before
I
leave
you
,
"
said
Leonard
,
rising
,
"
I
must
give
you
this
note

<EOS>
I
found
it
lying
before
your
chamber
door
as
I
passed
this
morning
.
<EOS>
How
it
came
there
I
know
not
,
but
I
can
give
a
shrewd
guess
as
to
the
writer
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
tell
you
,
that
but
for
what
has
just
occurred
,
I
should
not
have
delivered
it
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
from
Wyvil
--
I
mean
Rochester
,
"
said
Amabel
,
taking
the
note
with
a
trembling
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
it
,
child
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
snatching
it
from
her
,
and
breaking
the
seal
.
<EOS>
"
Insolent
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
as
she
cast
her
eyes
over
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
scarcely
contain
my
indignation
.
<EOS>
But
let
him
cross
my
path
again
,
and
he
shall
find
whether
I
can
not
resent
such
shameful
usage
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
does
he
say
,
dear
mother
?
"
asked
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
"
though
I
blush
to
repeat
his
words
:
'
Amabel
,
you
are
mine
.
<EOS>
No
one
shall
keep
you
from
me
.
<EOS>
Love
like
mine
will
triumph
over
all
obstacles!'--Love
like
his
,
forsooth
!
"
<EOS>
she
remarked
;
"
let
him
keep
such
stuff
as
that
for
Mistress
Mallet
,
or
his
other
mistresses
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
go
on
:
'
I
may
be
foiled
ninety
-
nine
times
,
but
the
hundredth
will
succeed
.
<EOS>
We
shall
soon
meet
again
.
  
<EOS>

MAURICE
WYVIL

'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
cried
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
never
meet
again
.
<EOS>
If
he
holds
me
thus
cheaply
,
I
will
let
him
see
that
he
is
mistaken
.
<EOS>
Leonard
Holt
,
I
have
told
you
the
exact
state
of
my
feelings
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
love
you
now
,
but
I
regard
you
as
a
true
friend
,
and
love
may
come
hereafter
.
<EOS>
If
in
a
month
's
time
you
claim
my
hand
;
if
my
father
consents
to
our
union
,
for
you
are
aware
that
my
mother
will
not
oppose
it
--
I
am
yours
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
attempted
to
speak
,
but
his
voice
was
choked
with
emotion
,
and
the
tears
started
to
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
"
said
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
let
us
meet
till
the
appointed
time
.
<EOS>
Rest
assured
,
I
will
think
of
you
as
you
deserve
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
could
not
meet
till
that
time
,
even
if
you
desired
it
,
"
said
Leonard
,
"
for
your
father
has
forbidden
any
of
the
household
,
except
old
Josyna
,
to
approach
you
till
all
fear
of
contagion
is
at
an
end
,
and
I
am
now
transgressing
his
commands
.
<EOS>
But
your
mother
,
I
am
sure
,
will
acquit
me
of
intentional
disobedience
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Bloundel
;
"
it
was
the
doctor
who
forced
you
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
heartily
glad
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
Amabel
,
"
said
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
Though
I
shall
not
see
you
,
I
will
watch
carefully
over
you
.
"
<EOS>
And
gazing
at
her
with
unutterable
affection
,
he
quitted
the
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
now
choose
between
the
heartless
and
depraved
nobleman
,
who
would
desert
you
as
soon
as
won
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
"
and
the
honest
apprentice
,
whose
life
would
be
devoted
to
your
happiness
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
have
_
chosen
,
"
replied
her
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
found
the
grocer
writing
at
a
small
table
,
close
to
the
bedside
of
his
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
happy
to
tell
you
,
Mr.
Bloundel
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
low
tone
,
as
he
entered
the
room
,
"
that
all
your
family
are
still
free
from
infection
,
and
with
due
care
will
,
I
hope
,
continue
so
.
<EOS>
But
I
entirely
approve
of
your
resolution
of
keeping
apart
from
them
till
the
month
has
expired
.
<EOS>
If
your
son
goes
on
as
he
is
doing
now
,
he
will
be
as
strong
as
ever
in
less
than
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
Still
,
as
we
can
not
foresee
what
may
occur
,
it
is
better
to
err
on
the
cautious
side
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
be
seated
for
a
moment
,
"
rejoined
the
grocer
,
motioning
the
other
to
the
chair
.
<EOS>
"
I
mentioned
to
you
last
night
that
in
case
my
son
recovered
,
I
had
a
plan
which
I
trusted
(
under
Providence
!
)
<EOS>
would
preserve
my
family
from
the
further
assaults
of
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
remember
your
alluding
to
it
,
"
replied
Hodges
,
"
and
should
be
glad
to
know
what
it
is
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
tell
it
you
in
confidence
,
"
rejoined
Bloundel
,
"
because
I
think
secresy
essential
to
its
entire
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
My
plan
is
a
very
simple
one
,
and
only
requires
firmness
in
its
execution
--
and
that
quality
,
I
think
,
I
possess
.
<EOS>
It
is
your
opinion
,
I
know
,
as
it
is
my
own
,
that
the
plague
will
increase
in
violence
and
endure
for
months
--
probably
,
till
next
winter
.
<EOS>
My
intention
is
to
store
my
house
with
provisions
,
as
a
ship
is
victualled
for
a
long
voyage
,
and
then
to
shut
it
up
entirely
till
the
scourge
ceases
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
your
project
is
practicable
,
"
said
Hodges
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
,
"
I
have
no
doubt
it
will
be
attended
,
with
every
good
result
you
can
desire
.
<EOS>
This
house
,
which
is
large
and
roomy
,
is
well
adapted
for
your
purpose
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
consider
well
whether
your
family
will
submit
to
be
imprisoned
during
the
long
period
you
propose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
shall
remain
close
prisoners
,
even
if
the
pestilence
lasts
for
a
twelvemonth
,
"
replied
the
grocer
.
<EOS>
"
Whoever
quits
the
house
,
when
it
is
once
closed
,
and
on
whatever
plea
,
be
it
wife
,
son
,
or
daughter
,
returns
not
.
<EOS>
That
is
my
fixed
resolve
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
right
,
"
rejoined
Hodges
,
"
for
on
that
determination
the
success
of
your
scheme
entirely
depends
.
<EOS>
"
 
While
they
were
thus
conversing
,
Leonard
entered
the
chamber
,
and
informed
his
master
that
Chowles
,
the
coffin
-
maker
,
and
Mrs.
Malmayns
,
the
plague
-
nurse
,
desired
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Malmayns
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Hodges
,
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
that
something
very
extraordinary
occurred
last
night
in
Saint
Faith
's
.
<EOS>
With
your
permission
,
Mr.
Bloundel
,
she
shall
be
admitted
;
I
want
to
ask
her
a
few
questions
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
hesitate
about
engaging
her
,
"
he
observed
to
the
grocer
,
as
Leonard
departed
,
"
for
she
is
a
woman
of
very
indifferent
character
,
though
she
may
(
for
aught
I
know
)
be
a
good
and
fearless
nurse
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
there
is
any
doubt
about
her
,
I
_
can
not
_
hesitate
,
"
returned
Bloundel
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
,
the
door
was
opened
by
Leonard
,
and
Chowles
and
Judith
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
latter
,
on
seeing
the
doctor
,
looked
greatly
embarrassed
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
brought
you
the
nurse
I
spoke
of
,
Mr.
Bloundel
,
"
said
Chowles
,
bowing
,
"
and
am
come
to
inquire
whether
you
want
a
coffin
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bloundel
is
not
likely
to
require
a
coffin
at
present
,
Chowles
,
"
returned
the
doctor
,
severely
;
"
neither
does
his
son
stand
in
need
of
a
nurse
.
<EOS>
How
is
your
husband
,
Mrs.
Malmayns
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
dead
,
sir
,
"
replied
Judith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dead
!
"
echoed
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
left
him
at
one
o'clock
this
morning
,
he
was
doing
well
.
<EOS>
Your
attendance
seems
to
have
accelerated
his
end
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
death
was
occasioned
by
an
accident
,
sir
,
"
replied
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
became
delirious
about
three
o'clock
,
and
,
in
spite
of
all
my
efforts
to
detain
him
,
started
out
of
bed
,
rushed
into
Saint
Faith
's
,
and
threw
himself
into
a
pit
,
which
Mr.
Lilly
and
some
other
persons
had
digged
in
search
of
treasure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
highly
improbable
story
,
Mrs.
Malmayns
,
"
returned
Hodges
,
"
and
I
must
have
the
matter
thoroughly
investigated
before
I
lose
sight
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
vouch
for
the
truth
of
Mrs.
Malmayn
's
statement
,
"
interposed
Chowles
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hodges
,
contemptuously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
,
"
replied
the
coffin
-
maker
.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
that
the
sexton
had
found
a
chest
of
treasure
buried
in
Saint
Faith
's
,
and
being
haunted
by
the
idea
that
some
one
was
carrying
it
off
,
he
suddenly
sprang
out
of
bed
,
and
rushed
to
the
church
,
where
,
sure
enough
,
Mr.
Lilly
,
Mr.
Quatremain
,
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
and
Sir
George
Etherege
,
having
,
by
the
help
of
mosaical
rods
,
discovered
this
very
chest
,
were
digging
it
up
.
<EOS>
Poor
Matthew
instantly
plunged
into
the
grave
,
and
died
of
a
sudden
chill
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
impossible
,
"
observed
Hodges
,
after
a
pause
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
has
become
of
the
treasure
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
in
the
possession
of
Mr.
Quatremain
,
who
has
given
notice
of
it
to
the
proper
authorities
,
"
replied
Chowles
.
<EOS>
"
It
consists
,
as
I
understand
,
of
gold
pieces
struck
in
the
reign
of
Philip
and
Mary
,
images
of
the
same
metal
,
crosses
,
pyxes
,
chalices
,
and
other
Popish
and
superstitious
vessels
,
buried
,
probably
,
when
Queen
Elizabeth
came
to
the
throne
,
and
the
religion
changed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
unlikely
,
"
replied
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
is
your
husband
's
body
,
Mrs.
Malmayns
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
removed
to
the
vault
which
he
usually
occupied
,
"
replied
Judith
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Chowles
has
undertaken
to
bury
it
to
-
night
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
it
first
,
"
replied
Hodges
,
"
and
be
sure
that
he
has
not
met
with
foul
play
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
will
accompany
you
,
"
said
Chowles
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
you
do
not
want
a
coffin
,
Mr.
Bloundel
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
grocer
shook
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
day
,
Mr.
Bloundel
,
"
said
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
visit
you
to
-
morrow
,
and
hope
to
find
your
son
as
well
as
I
leave
him
.
<EOS>
Chowles
,
you
will
be
answerable
for
the
safe
custody
of
Mrs.
Malmayns
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
desire
to
escape
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
nurse
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
everything
as
I
have
represented
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
,
"
replied
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
If
not
,
you
will
have
to
tend
the
sick
in
Newgate
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
trio
then
proceeded
to
Saint
Paul
's
,
and
descended
to
the
vaults
.
<EOS>
Hodges
carefully
examined
the
body
of
the
unfortunate
sexton
,
but
though
he
entertained
strong
suspicions
,
he
could
not
pronounce
positively
that
he
had
been
improperly
treated
;
and
as
the
statement
of
Mrs.
Malmayns
was
fully
borne
out
by
the
vergers
and
others
,
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
pursue
the
investigation
further
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
gone
,
Judith
accompanied
the
coffin
-
maker
to
his
residence
,
where
she
remained
,
till
the
evening
,
when
she
was
suddenly
summoned
,
in
a
case
of
urgency
,
by
a
messenger
from
Sibbald
,
the
apothecary
of
Clerkenwell
.
  
<EOS>
X.
 
THE
DUEL
.
 
<EOS>
After
Parravicin
's
terrible
announcement
,
Disbrowe
offered
him
no
further
violence
,
but
,
flinging
down
his
sword
,
burst
open
the
door
,
and
rushed
upstairs
.
<EOS>
His
wife
was
still
insensible
,
but
the
fatal
mark
that
had
betrayed
the
presence
of
the
plague
to
the
knight
manifested
itself
also
to
him
,
and
he
stood
like
one
entranced
,
until
Mrs.
Disbrowe
,
recovering
from
her
swoon
,
opened
her
eyes
,
and
,
gazing
at
him
<EOS>
,
cried--"You
here!--Oh
Disbrowe
,
I
dreamed
you
had
deserted
me
--
had
sold
me
to
another
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Would
it
were
a
dream
!
"
<EOS>
replied
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
was
it
not
so
?
"
<EOS>
she
rejoined
,
pressing
her
hand
to
her
temples
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
I
feel
it
is
.
<EOS>
Every
circumstance
rushes
upon
me
plainly
and
distinctly
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
daring
libertine
before
me
.
<EOS>
He
stood
where
you
stand
,
and
told
me
what
you
had
done
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
tell
you
,
Margaret
?
"
asked
Disbrowe
in
a
hollow
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
told
me
you
were
false
--
that
you
loved
another
,
and
had
abandoned
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
lied
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Disbrowe
,
in
a
voice
of
uncontrollable
fury
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
that
,
in
a
moment
of
frenzy
,
I
was
tempted
to
set
you
--
<EOS>
yes
,
_
you
_
,
Margaret
--
against
all
I
had
lost
at
play
,
and
was
compelled
to
yield
up
the
key
of
my
house
to
the
winner
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
never
been
faithless
to
you
--
never
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Faithless
or
not
<EOS>
,
"
replied
his
wife
,
bitterly
,
"
it
is
plain
you
value
me
less
than
play
,
or
you
would
not
have
acted
thus
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Reproach
me
not
,
Margaret
,
"
replied
Disbrowe
;
"
I
would
give
worlds
to
undo
what
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
shall
guard
me
against
the
recurrence
of
such
conduct
?
"
said
Mrs.
Disbrowe
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
not
yet
informed
me
how
I
was
saved
.
"
 
<EOS>
Disbrowe
averted
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
mean
you
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
seizing
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
What
has
happened
?
<EOS>
Do
not
keep
me
in
suspense
?
<EOS>
Were
you
my
preserver
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
preserver
was
the
plague
,
"
rejoined
Disbrowe
,
in
a
sombre
tone
.
 
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
lady
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
perceived
that
she
was
attacked
by
the
pestilence
,
and
a
long
and
dreadful
pause
ensued
,
broken
only
by
exclamations
of
anguish
from
both
.
 
<EOS>
"
Disbrowe
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Margaret
,
at
length
,
raising
herself
in
bed
,
"
you
have
deeply
--
irrecoverably
injured
me
.
<EOS>
But
promise
me
one
thing
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
swear
to
do
whatever
you
may
desire
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
,
after
what
I
have
heard
,
whether
you
have
courage
for
the
deed
,
"
she
continued
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
would
have
you
kill
this
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
it
,
"
replied
Disbrowe
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
but
his
blood
can
wipe
out
the
wrong
he
has
done
me
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
Challenge
him
to
a
duel
--
a
mortal
duel
.
<EOS>
If
he
survives
,
by
my
soul
,
I
will
give
myself
to
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Margaret
!
"
exclaimed
Disbrowe
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
swear
it
,
"
she
rejoined
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
know
my
passionate
nature
too
well
to
doubt
I
will
keep
my
word
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
the
plague
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
does
that
matter
?
<EOS>
I
may
recover
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
,
"
muttered
Disbrowe
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
fall
,
I
will
take
care
<EOS>
you
do
not
recover
.
<EOS>
I
will
fight
him
to
-
morrow
,
"
he
added
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
summoned
his
servants
,
but
when
they
found
their
mistress
was
attacked
by
the
plague
,
they
framed
some
excuse
to
leave
the
room
,
and
instantly
fled
the
house
.
<EOS>
Driven
almost
to
his
wits
'
end
,
Disbrowe
went
in
search
of
other
assistance
,
and
was
for
a
while
unsuccessful
,
until
a
coachman
,
to
whom
he
applied
,
offered
,
for
a
suitable
reward
,
to
drive
to
Clerkenwell
--
to
the
shop
of
an
apothecary
named
Sibbald
(
with
whose
name
the
reader
is
already
familiar
)
,
who
was
noted
for
his
treatment
of
plague
patients
,
and
to
bring
him
to
the
other
's
residence
.
<EOS>
Disbrowe
immediately
closed
with
the
man
,
and
in
less
than
two
hours
Sibbald
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
singular
and
repulsive
personage
,
with
an
immense
hooked
nose
,
dark
,
savage
-
looking
eyes
,
a
skin
like
parchment
,
and
high
round
shoulders
,
which
procured
him
the
nickname
of
Aesop
among
his
neighbours
.
<EOS>
He
was
under
the
middle
size
,
and
of
a
spare
figure
,
and
in
age
might
be
about
sixty
-
five
.
 
<EOS>
On
seeing
Mrs.
Disbrowe
,
he
at
once
boldly
asserted
that
he
could
cure
her
,
and
proceeded
to
apply
his
remedies
.
<EOS>
Finding
the
servants
fled
,
he
offered
to
procure
a
nurse
for
Disbrowe
,
and
the
latter
,
thanking
him
,
eagerly
embraced
the
offer
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
he
departed
.
<EOS>
In
the
evening
the
nurse
,
who
(
as
may
be
surmised
)
was
no
other
than
Judith
Malmayns
,
arrived
,
and
immediately
commenced
her
functions
.
 
<EOS>
Disbrowe
had
no
rest
that
night
.
<EOS>
His
wife
slept
occasionally
for
a
few
minutes
,
but
,
apparently
engrossed
by
one
idea
,
never
failed
when
she
awoke
to
urge
him
to
slay
Parravicin
;
repeating
her
oath
to
give
herself
to
the
knight
if
he
came
off
victorious
.
<EOS>
Worn
out
at
length
,
Disbrowe
gave
her
a
terrible
look
,
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
alone
many
minutes
when
he
was
surprised
by
the
entrance
of
Judith
.
<EOS>
He
eagerly
inquired
whether
his
wife
was
worse
,
but
was
informed
she
had
dropped
into
a
slumber
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hearing
what
has
passed
between
you
,
"
said
the
nurse
,
"
and
noticing
your
look
when
you
left
the
room
<EOS>
,
I
came
to
tell
you
,
that
if
you
fall
in
this
duel
,
your
last
moments
need
not
be
embittered
by
any
thoughts
of
your
wife
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
care
<EOS>
she
does
not
recover
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
A
horrible
smile
lighted
up
Disbrowe
's
features
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
very
person
I
want
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
would
do
evil
,
the
fiend
rises
to
my
bidding
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
slain
,
you
know
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
How
shall
I
requite
the
service
?
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
not
concern
yourself
about
that
,
captain
,
"
rejoined
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
care
of
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
About
noon
,
on
the
following
day
,
Disbrowe
,
without
venturing
to
see
his
wife
,
left
the
house
,
and
proceeded
to
the
Smyrna
,
where
,
as
he
expected
,
he
found
Parravicin
and
his
companions
.
 
<EOS>
The
knight
instantly
advanced
towards
him
,
and
,
laying
aside
for
the
moment
his
reckless
air
,
inquired
,
with
a
look
of
commiseration
,
after
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
better
,
"
replied
Disbrowe
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
to
settle
accounts
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
they
were
settled
long
ago
,
"
returned
Parravicin
,
instantly
resuming
his
wonted
manner
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
glad
to
find
you
consider
the
debt
unpaid
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Disbrowe
lifted
the
cane
he
held
in
his
hand
,
and
struck
the
knight
with
it
forcibly
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
Be
that
my
answer
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
your
life
first
,
and
your
wife
afterwards
,
"
replied
Parravicin
,
furiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
her
if
you
slay
me
,
but
not
otherwise
,
"
retorted
Disbrowe
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
a
mortal
duel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
,
"
replied
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
spare
you
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Spare
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shield
of
Agamemnon
!
<EOS>
I
should
hope
not
.
<EOS>
Spit
him
as
you
would
a
wild
boar
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Peace
,
fool
!
"
cried
Parravicin
.
"
<EOS>
Captain
Disbrowe
,
I
shall
instantly
proceed
to
the
west
side
of
Hyde
Park
,
beneath
the
trees
.
<EOS>
I
shall
expect
you
there
.
<EOS>
On
my
return
I
shall
call
on
your
wife
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
pray
you
do
so
,
sir
,
"
replied
Disbrowe
,
disdainfully
.
 
<EOS>
Both
then
quitted
the
coffee
-
house
,
Parravicin
attended
by
Rochester
and
Pillichody
,
and
Disbrowe
accompanied
by
a
military
friend
,
whom
he
accidentally
encountered
.
<EOS>
Each
party
taking
a
coach
,
they
soon
reached
the
ground,--a
retired
spot
,
completely
screened
from
observation
by
trees
.
<EOS>
The
preliminaries
were
soon
arranged
,
for
neither
would
admit
of
delay
.
<EOS>
The
conflict
then
commenced
with
great
fury
on
both
sides
;
but
Parravicin
,
in
spite
of
his
passion
,
observed
far
more
caution
than
his
antagonist
;
and
,
taking
advantage
of
an
unguarded
movement
,
occasioned
by
the
other
's
impetuosity
,
passed
his
sword
through
his
body
.
 
<EOS>
Disbrowe
fell
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
again
successful
,
"
he
groaned
,
"
but
save
my
wife
--
save
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
mean
you
?
"
cried
Parravicin
,
leaning
over
him
,
as
he
wiped
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
But
Disbrowe
could
make
no
answer
.
<EOS>
His
utterance
was
choked
by
a
sudden
effusion
of
blood
on
the
lungs
,
and
he
instantly
expired
.
<EOS>
Leaving
the
body
in
care
of
the
second
,
Parravicin
and
his
friends
returned
to
the
coach
,
where
the
major
rejoiced
greatly
at
the
issue
of
the
duel
;
but
the
knight
looked
grave
,
and
pondered
upon
the
words
of
the
dying
man
.
<EOS>
After
a
time
,
however
,
he
recovered
his
spirits
,
and
dined
with
his
friends
at
the
Smyrna
;
but
they
observed
that
he
drank
more
deeply
than
usual
.
<EOS>
His
excesses
did
not
,
however
,
prevent
him
from
playing
with
his
usual
skill
,
and
he
won
a
large
sum
from
Rochester
at
hazard
.
 
<EOS>
Flushed
with
success
,
and
heated
with
wine
,
he
walked
up
to
Disbrowe
's
residence
about
an
hour
after
midnight
.
<EOS>
As
he
approached
the
house
,
he
observed
a
strangely
-
shaped
cart
at
the
door
,
and
,
halting
for
a
moment
,
saw
a
body
,
wrapped
in
a
shroud
,
brought
out
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
Mrs.
Disbrowe
?
<EOS>
Rushing
forward
,
to
one
of
the
assistants
in
black
cloaks
--
and
who
was
no
other
than
Chowles
--
he
asked
whom
he
was
about
to
inter
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
Mrs.
Disbrowe
,
"
replied
the
coffin
-
maker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
died
of
grief
,
because
her
husband
was
killed
this
morning
in
a
duel
;
but
as
she
had
the
plague
,
it
must
be
put
down
to
that
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
particular
in
such
matters
,
and
shall
bury
her
and
her
husband
together
;
and
as
there
is
no
money
left
to
pay
for
coffins
,
they
must
go
to
the
grave
without
them
.
<EOS>
What
,
ho
!
<EOS>
Mother
Malmayns
,
let
Jonas
have
the
captain
as
soon
as
you
have
stripped
him
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
starting
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
the
body
of
his
victim
was
brought
forth
,
Parravicin
fell
against
the
wall
in
a
state
almost
of
stupefaction
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Solomon
Eagle
,
with
his
brazier
on
his
head
,
suddenly
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
,
and
stationing
himself
before
the
dead
-
cart
,
cried
in
a
voice
of
thunder
,
"
<EOS>
Woe
to
the
libertine
!
<EOS>
woe
to
the
homicide
!
<EOS>
for
he
shall
perish
in
everlasting
fire
!
<EOS>
Woe
!
<EOS>
woe
!

PROGRESS
OF
THE
PESTILENCE
.
 
<EOS>
Towards
the
middle
of
May
,
the
bills
of
mortality
began
to
swell
greatly
in
amount
,
and
though
but
few
were
put
down
to
the
plague
,
and
a
large
number
to
the
spotted
fever
(
another
frightful
disorder
raging
at
the
period
)
,
it
is
well
known
that
the
bulk
had
died
of
the
former
disease
.
<EOS>
The
rigorous
measures
adopted
by
the
authorities
(
whether
salutary
or
not
has
been
questioned
)
,
in
shutting
up
houses
and
confining
the
sick
and
sound
within
them
for
forty
days
,
were
found
so
intolerable
,
that
most
persons
were
disposed
to
run
any
risk
rather
than
be
subjected
to
such
a
grievance
,
and
every
artifice
was
resorted
to
for
concealing
a
case
when
it
occurred
.
<EOS>
Hence
,
it
seldom
happened
,
unless
by
accident
,
that
a
discovery
was
made
.
<EOS>
Quack
doctors
were
secretly
consulted
,
instead
of
the
regular
practitioners
;
the
searchers
were
bribed
to
silence
;
and
large
fees
were
given
to
the
undertakers
and
buriers
to
lay
the
deaths
to
the
account
of
some
other
disorder
.
<EOS>
All
this
,
however
,
did
not
blind
the
eyes
of
the
officers
to
the
real
state
of
things
.
<EOS>
Redoubling
their
vigilance
,
they
entered
houses
on
mere
suspicion
;
inflicted
punishments
where
they
found
their
orders
disobeyed
or
neglected
;
sent
the
sound
to
prison,--the
sick
to
the
pest
-
house
;
and
replaced
the
faithless
searchers
by
others
upon
whom
they
could
place
reliance
.
<EOS>
Many
cases
were
thus
detected
;
but
in
spite
of
every
precaution
,
the
majority
escaped
;
and
the
vent
was
no
sooner
stopped
in
one
quarter
than
it
broke
out
with
additional
violence
in
another
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
alarm
had
become
general
.
<EOS>
All
whose
business
or
pursuits
permitted
it
,
prepared
to
leave
London
,
which
they
regarded
as
a
devoted
city
,
without
delay
.
<EOS>
As
many
houses
were
,
therefore
,
closed
from
the
absence
of
the
inhabitants
as
from
the
presence
of
the
plague
,
and
this
added
to
the
forlorn
appearance
of
the
streets
,
which
in
some
quarters
were
almost
deserted
.
<EOS>
For
a
while
,
nothing
was
seen
at
the
great
outlets
of
the
city
but
carts
,
carriages
,
and
other
vehicles
,
filled
with
goods
and
movables
,
on
their
way
to
the
country
;
and
,
as
may
be
supposed
,
the
departure
of
their
friends
did
not
tend
to
abate
the
dejection
of
those
whose
affairs
compelled
them
to
remain
behind
.
 
<EOS>
One
circumstance
must
not
be
passed
unnoticed
,
namely
,
the
continued
fineness
and
beauty
of
the
weather
.
<EOS>
No
rain
had
fallen
for
upwards
of
three
weeks
.
<EOS>
The
sky
was
bright
and
cloudless
;
the
atmosphere
,
apparently
,
pure
and
innoxious
;
while
the
heat
was
as
great
as
is
generally
experienced
in
the
middle
of
summer
.
<EOS>
But
instead
of
producing
its
usual
enlivening
effect
on
the
spirits
,
the
fine
weather
added
to
the
general
gloom
and
apprehension
,
inasmuch
as
it
led
to
the
belief
(
afterwards
fully
confirmed
)
,
that
if
the
present
warmth
was
so
pernicious
,
the
more
sultry
seasons
which
were
near
at
hand
would
aggravate
the
fury
of
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
indeed
,
when
the
deaths
were
less
numerous
,
a
hope
began
to
be
entertained
that
the
distemper
was
abating
,
and
confidence
was
for
a
moment
restored
;
but
these
anticipations
were
speedily
checked
by
the
reappearance
of
the
scourge
,
which
seemed
to
baffle
and
deride
all
human
skill
and
foresight
.
 
<EOS>
London
now
presented
a
lamentable
spectacle
.
<EOS>
Not
a
street
but
had
a
house
in
it
marked
with
a
red
cross
--
some
streets
had
many
such
.
<EOS>
The
bells
were
continually
tolling
for
burials
,
and
the
dead
-
carts
went
their
melancholy
rounds
at
night
and
were
constantly
loaded
.
<EOS>
Fresh
directions
were
issued
by
the
authorities
;
and
as
domestic
animals
were
considered
to
be
a
medium
of
conveying
the
infection
,
an
order
,
which
was
immediately
carried
into
effect
,
was
given
to
destroy
all
dogs
and
cats
.
<EOS>
But
this
plan
proved
prejudicial
rather
than
the
reverse
,
as
the
bodies
of
the
poor
animals
,
most
of
which
were
drowned
in
the
Thames
,
being
washed
ashore
,
produced
a
horrible
and
noxious
effluvium
,
supposed
to
contribute
materially
to
the
propagation
of
the
distemper
.
 
<EOS>
No
precautionary
measure
was
neglected
;
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
any
human
interference
could
have
averted
the
severity
of
the
scourge
,
which
,
though
its
progress
might
be
checked
for
a
few
days
by
attention
,
or
increased
in
the
same
ratio
by
neglect
,
would
in
the
end
have
unquestionably
fulfilled
its
mission
.
<EOS>
The
College
of
Physicians
,
by
the
king
's
command
,
issued
simple
and
intelligible
directions
,
in
the
mother
tongue
,
for
the
sick
.
<EOS>
Certain
of
their
number
,
amongst
whom
was
the
reader
's
acquaintance
,
Doctor
Hodges
,
were
appointed
to
attend
the
infected
;
and
two
out
of
the
Court
of
Aldermen
were
required
to
see
that
they
duly
executed
their
dangerous
office
.
<EOS>
Public
prayers
and
a
general
fast
were
likewise
enjoined
.
<EOS>
But
Heaven
seemed
deaf
to
the
supplications
of
the
doomed
inhabitants
--
their
prayers
being
followed
by
a
fearful
increase
of
deaths
.
<EOS>
A
vast
crowd
was
collected
within
Saint
Paul
's
to
hear
a
sermon
preached
by
Doctor
Sheldon
,
Archbishop
of
Canterbury,--a
prelate
greatly
distinguished
during
the
whole
course
of
the
visitation
,
by
his
unremitting
charity
and
attention
to
the
sick
;
and
before
the
discourse
was
concluded
,
several
fell
down
within
the
sacred
walls
,
and
,
on
being
conveyed
to
their
own
homes
,
were
found
to
be
infected
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
,
too
,
many
others
who
had
been
present
were
seized
with
the
disorder
.
 
<EOS>
A
fresh
impulse
was
given
to
the
pestilence
from
an
unlooked
for
cause
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
mentioned
that
the
shutting
up
of
houses
and
seclusion
of
the
sick
were
regarded
as
an
intolerable
grievance
,
and
though
most
were
compelled
to
submit
to
it
,
some
few
resisted
,
and
tumults
and
disturbances
ensued
.
<EOS>
As
the
plague
increased
,
these
disturbances
became
more
frequent
,
and
the
mob
always
taking
part
against
the
officers
,
they
were
frequently
interrupted
in
the
execution
of
their
duty
.
 
<EOS>
About
this
time
a
more
serious
affray
than
usual
occurred
,
attended
-
with
loss
of
life
and
other
unfortunate
consequences
,
which
it
may
be
worth
while
to
relate
,
as
illustrative
of
the
peculiar
state
of
the
times
.
<EOS>
The
wife
of
a
merchant
,
named
Barcroft
,
residing
in
Lothbury
,
being
attacked
by
the
plague
,
the
husband
,
fearing
his
house
would
be
shut
up
,
withheld
all
information
from
the
examiners
and
searchers
.
<EOS>
His
wife
died
,
and
immediately
afterwards
one
of
his
children
was
attacked
.
<EOS>
Still
he
refused
to
give
notice
.
<EOS>
The
matter
,
however
,
got
wind
.
<EOS>
The
searchers
arrived
at
night
,
and
being
refused
admittance
,
they
broke
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
Finding
undoubted
evidence
of
infection
,
they
ordered
it
to
be
closed
,
stationed
a
watchman
at
the
door
,
and
marked
it
with
the
fatal
sign
.
<EOS>
Barcroft
remonstrated
against
their
proceedings
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
They
told
him
he
might
think
himself
well
off
that
he
was
not
carried
before
the
Lord
Mayor
,
who
would
undoubtedly
send
him
to
Ludgate
;
and
with
other
threats
to
the
like
effect
,
they
departed
.
 
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
man
's
wife
and
child
were
removed
the
following
night
in
the
dead
-
cart
,
and
,
driven
half
-
mad
by
grief
and
terror
<EOS>
,
he
broke
open
the
door
of
his
dwelling
,
and
,
plunging
a
sword
in
the
watchman
's
breast
,
who
opposed
his
flight
,
gained
the
street
.
<EOS>
A
party
of
the
watch
happened
to
be
passing
at
the
time
,
and
the
fugitive
was
instantly
secured
.
<EOS>
He
made
a
great
clamour
,
however,--calling
to
his
neighbours
and
the
bystanders
to
rescue
him
,
and
in
another
moment
the
watch
was
beaten
off
,
and
Barcroft
placed
on
a
post
,
whence
he
harangued
his
preservers
on
the
severe
restraints
imposed
upon
the
citizens
,
urging
them
to
assist
in
throwing
open
the
doors
of
all
infected
houses
,
and
allowing
free
egress
to
their
inmates
.
 
<EOS>
Greedily
listening
to
this
insane
counsel
,
the
mob
resolved
to
act
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Headed
by
the
merchant
,
they
ran
down
Thread
-
needle
-
street
,
and
,
crossing
Stock
's
Market
,
burst
open
several
houses
in
Bearbinder
-
lane
,
and
drove
away
the
watchmen
.
<EOS>
One
man
,
more
courageous
than
the
others
,
tried
to
maintain
his
post
,
and
was
so
severely
handled
by
his
assailants
,
that
he
died
a
few
days
afterwards
of
the
injuries
he
had
received
.
<EOS>
Most
of
those
who
had
been
imprisoned
within
their
dwellings
immediately
issued
forth
,
and
joining
the
mob
,
which
received
fresh
recruits
each
moment
,
started
on
the
same
errand
.
 
<EOS>
Loud
shouts
were
now
raised
of--"Open
the
doors
!
<EOS>
No
plague
prisoners
!
<EOS>
No
plague
prisoners
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
mob
set
off
along
the
Poultry
.
<EOS>
They
halted
,
however
,
before
the
Great
Conduit
,
near
the
end
of
Bucklersbury
,
and
opposite
Mercer
's
Hall
,
because
they
perceived
a
company
of
the
Train
-
bands
advancing
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
A
council
of
war
was
held
,
and
many
of
the
rabble
were
disposed
to
fly
;
but
Barcroft
again
urged
them
to
proceed
,
and
they
were
unexpectedly
added
by
Solomon
Eagle
,
who
,
bursting
through
their
ranks
,
with
his
brazier
on
his
head
,
crying
,
"
<EOS>
Awake
!
<EOS>
sleepers
,
awake
!
<EOS>
the
plague
is
at
your
doors
!
<EOS>
awake
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
speeded
towards
the
Train
-
bands
,
scattering
sparks
of
fire
as
he
pursued
his
swift
career
.
<EOS>
The
mob
instantly
followed
,
and
,
adding
their
shouts
to
his
outcries
,
dashed
on
with
such
fury
that
the
Train
-
bands
did
not
dare
to
oppose
them
,
and
,
after
a
slight
and
ineffectual
resistance
,
were
put
to
rout
.
 
<EOS>
Barcroft
,
who
acted
as
leader
,
informed
them
that
there
was
a
house
in
Wood
-
street
shut
up
,
and
the
crowd
accompanied
him
thither
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
they
had
reached
Bloundel
's
shop
,
but
finding
no
one
on
guard
--
for
the
watchman
,
guessing
their
errand
,
had
taken
to
his
heels
--
they
smeared
over
the
fatal
cross
and
inscription
with
a
pail
of
mud
gathered
from
the
neighbouring
kennel
,
and
then
broke
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
grocer
and
his
apprentice
hearing
the
disturbance
,
and
being
greatly
alarmed
at
it
,
hurried
to
the
shop
,
and
found
it
full
of
people
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
at
liberty
Mr.
Bloundel
,
"
cried
the
merchant
,
who
was
acquainted
with
the
grocer
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
determined
no
longer
to
let
our
families
be
imprisoned
at
the
pleasure
of
the
Lord
Mayor
and
aldermen
.
<EOS>
We
mean
to
break
open
all
the
plague
houses
,
and
set
free
their
inmates
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
consider
what
you
are
about
,
Mr.
Barcroft
,
"
cried
the
grocer
.
<EOS>
"
My
house
has
been
closed
for
nearly
a
month
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
as
my
son
has
entirely
recovered
,
and
received
his
certificate
of
health
from
Doctor
Hodges
,
it
would
have
been
opened
in
three
days
hence
by
the
officers
;
so
that
I
have
suffered
all
the
inconvenience
of
the
confinement
,
and
can
speak
to
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
doubt
very
irksome
,
and
may
be
almost
intolerable
to
persons
of
an
impatient
temperament
:
<EOS>
but
I
firmly
believe
it
is
the
only
means
to
check
the
progress
of
contagion
.
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
,
Mr.
Barcroft
--
listen
to
me
,
good
friends
,
and
hesitate
before
you
violate
laws
which
have
been
made
expressly
to
meet
this
terrible
emergency
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
he
was
checked
by
loud
groans
and
upbraidings
from
the
bystanders
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
tells
you
himself
that
the
period
of
his
confinement
is
just
over
,
"
cried
Barcroft
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
plain
he
has
no
interest
in
the
matter
,
except
that
he
would
have
others
suffer
as
he
has
done
.
<EOS>
Heed
him
not
,
my
friends
;
but
proceed
with
the
good
work
.
<EOS>
Liberate
the
poor
plague
prisoners
.
<EOS>
Liberate
them
.
<EOS>
On
!
on
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Forbear
,
rash
men
"
cried
Bloundel
,
in
an
authoritative
voice
.
"
<EOS>
In
the
name
of
those
you
are
bound
to
obey
,
I
command
you
to
desist
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Command
us
!
"
cried
one
of
the
bystanders
,
raising
his
staff
in
a
menacing
manner
.
<EOS>
"
Is
this
your
gratitude
for
the
favour
we
have
just
conferred
upon
you
?
<EOS>
Command
us
,
forsooth
!
<EOS>
You
had
better
repeat
the
order
,
and
see
how
it
will
be
obeyed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
do
<EOS>
_
repeat
it
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
the
grocer
,
firmly
.
"
<EOS>
In
the
Lord
Mayor
's
name
,
I
command
you
to
desist
,
and
return
to
your
homes
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
man
would
have
struck
him
with
his
staff
,
if
he
had
not
been
himself
felled
to
the
ground
by
Leonard
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
signal
for
greater
outrage
.
<EOS>
The
grocer
and
his
apprentice
were
instantly
assailed
by
several
others
of
the
mob
,
who
,
leaving
them
both
on
the
floor
covered
with
bruises
,
helped
themselves
to
all
they
could
lay
hands
on
in
the
shop
,
and
then
quitted
the
premises
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
scarcely
necessary
to
track
their
course
further
;
and
it
may
be
sufficient
to
state
,
that
they
broke
open
upwards
of
fifty
houses
in
different
streets
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
plague
-
stricken
joined
them
,
and
several
half
-
naked
creatures
were
found
dead
in
the
streets
on
the
following
morning
.
<EOS>
Two
houses
in
Blackfriars
-
lane
were
set
on
fire
,
and
the
conflagration
was
with
difficulty
checked
;
nor
was
it
until
late
on
the
following
day
that
the
mob
could
be
entirely
dispersed
.
<EOS>
The
originator
of
the
disturbance
,
Barcroft
,
after
a
desperate
resistance
,
was
shot
through
the
head
by
a
constable
.
 
<EOS>
The
result
of
this
riot
,
as
will
be
easily
foreseen
,
was
greatly
to
increase
the
pestilence
;
and
many
of
those
who
had
been
most
active
in
it
perished
in
prison
of
the
distemper
.
<EOS>
Far
from
being
discouraged
by
the
opposition
offered
to
their
decrees
,
the
city
authorities
enforced
them
with
greater
rigour
than
ever
,
and
,
doubling
the
number
of
the
watch
,
again
shut
up
all
those
houses
which
had
been
broken
open
during
the
late
tumult
.
 
<EOS>
Bloundel
received
a
visit
from
the
Lord
Mayor
,
Sir
John
Lawrence
,
who
,
having
been
informed
of
his
conduct
,
came
to
express
his
high
approval
of
it
,
offering
to
remit
the
few
days
yet
unexpired
of
his
quarantine
.
<EOS>
The
grocer
,
however
,
declined
the
offer
,
and
with
renewed
expressions
of
approbation
,
Sir
John
Lawrence
took
his
leave
.
 
<EOS>
Three
days
afterwards
,
the
Examiner
of
Health
pronounced
the
grocer
's
house
free
from
infection
.
<EOS>
The
fatal
mark
was
obliterated
from
the
door
;
the
shutters
were
unfastened
;
and
Bloundel
resumed
his
business
as
usual
.
<EOS>
Words
are
inadequate
to
describe
the
delight
that
filled
the
breast
of
every
member
of
his
family
,
on
their
first
meeting
after
their
long
separation
.
<EOS>
It
took
place
in
the
room
adjoining
the
shop
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bloundel
received
the
joyful
summons
from
Leonard
,
and
,
on
descending
with
her
children
,
found
her
husband
and
her
son
Stephen
anxiously
expecting
her
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
able
to
make
up
her
mind
as
to
which
of
the
two
she
should
embrace
first
,
Mrs.
Bloundel
was
decided
by
the
pale
countenance
of
her
son
,
and
rushing
towards
him
,
she
strained
him
to
her
breast
,
while
Amabel
flew
to
her
father
's
arms
.
<EOS>
The
grocer
could
not
repress
his
tears
;
but
they
were
tears
of
joy
,
and
that
night
's
happiness
made
him
ample
amends
for
all
the
anxiety
he
had
recently
undergone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Stephen
,
my
dear
child
,
"
said
his
mother
,
as
soon
as
the
first
tumult
of
emotion
had
subsided,--"well
,
Stephen
,
"
she
said
,
smiling
at
him
through
her
tears
,
and
almost
smothering
him
with
kisses
,
"
you
are
not
so
much
altered
as
I
expected
;
and
I
do
not
think
,
if
I
had
had
the
care
of
you
,
I
could
have
nursed
you
better
myself
.
<EOS>
You
owe
your
father
a
second
life
,
and
we
all
owe
him
the
deepest
gratitude
for
the
care
he
has
taken
of
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
never
be
sufficiently
grateful
for
his
kindness
,
"
returned
Stephen
,
affectionately
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
thanks
to
the
beneficent
Being
who
has
preserved
you
from
this
great
danger
,
my
son
,
not
to
me
,
"
returned
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
The
first
moments
of
our
reunion
should
be
worthily
employed
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
summoned
the
household
,
and
,
for
the
first
time
for
a
month
,
the
whole
family
party
assembled
,
as
before
,
at
prayer
.
<EOS>
Never
were
thanksgivings
more
earnestly
,
more
devoutly
uttered
.
<EOS>
All
arose
with
bright
and
cheerful
countenances
;
and
even
Blaize
seemed
to
have
shaken
off
his
habitual
dread
of
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
As
he
retired
with
Patience
,
he
observed
to
her
,
"
Master
Stephen
looks
quite
well
,
though
a
little
thinner
.
<EOS>
I
must
ascertain
from
him
the
exact
course
of
treatment
pursued
by
his
father
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
Mr.
Bloundel
would
nurse
_
me
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
if
I
were
to
be
suddenly
seized
with
the
distemper
?

If
he
would
n't
,
I

would

"
replied
Patience
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
thank
you
,
"
replied
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
think
we
shall
get
through
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
out
to
-
morrow
and
examine
the
bills
of
mortality
,
and
see
what
progress
the
plague
is
making
.
<EOS>
I
am
all
anxiety
to
know
.
<EOS>
I
must
get
a
fresh
supply
of
medicine
,
too
.
<EOS>
My
private
store
is
quite
gone
,
except
three
of
my
favourite
rufuses
,
which
I
shall
take
before
I
go
to
bed
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Unluckily
,
my
purse
is
as
empty
as
my
phials
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
lend
you
a
little
money
,
"
said
Patience
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
touched
my
last
year
's
wages
.
<EOS>
They
are
quite
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
too
good
,
"
replied
Blaize
;
"
but
I
wo
n't
decline
the
offer
.
<EOS>
I
heard
a
man
crying
a
new
anti
-
pestilential
elixir
,
as
he
passed
the
house
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
must
find
him
out
and
buy
a
bottle
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
must
call
on
my
friend
Parkhurst
,
the
apothecary.--You
are
a
good
girl
,
Patience
,
and
I
'll
marry
you
as
soon
as
the
plague
ceases
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
something
else
to
give
you
,
"
rejoined
Patience
.
<EOS>
"
This
little
bag
contains
a
hazel
-
nut
,
from
which
I
have
picked
the
kernel
,
and
filled
its
place
with
quicksilver
,
stopping
the
hole
with
wax
.
<EOS>
Wear
it
round
your
neck
,
and
you
will
find
it
a
certain
preservative
against
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
told
you
of
this
remedy
?
"
asked
Blaize
,
taking
the
bag
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
mother
,
"
returned
Patience
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
I
never
heard
of
it
,
"
said
the
porter
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
would
n't
mention
it
to
you
,
because
the
doctor
advised
her
not
to
put
such
matters
into
your
head
,
"
replied
Patience
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
could
n't
help
indulging
you
.
<EOS>
Heigho
!
<EOS>
I
hope
the
plague
will
soon
be
over
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
be
over
for
six
months
,
"
rejoined
Blaize
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
read
in
a
little
book
,
published
in
1593
,
in
Queen
Elizabeth
's
reign
,
and
written
by
Simon
Kelway
,
'
that
when
little
children
flock
together
,
and
pretend
that
some
of
their
number
are
dead
,
solemnizing
the
burial
in
a
mournful
sort
,
it
is
a
certain
token
that
a
great
mortality
is
at
hand
.
'
<EOS>
This
I
have
myself
seen
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
Again
,
just
before
the
great
sickness
of
1625
,
the
churchyard
wall
of
St.
Andrew
's
,
Holborn
,
fell
down
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
that
the
same
thing
occurred
after
the
frost
this
winter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
heard
of
it
,
"
replied
Patience
:
"
<EOS>
but
I
did
not
know
it
was
a
bad
sign
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
dreadful
sign
,
"
returned
Blaize
,
with
a
shudder
"
The
thought
of
it
brings
back
my
old
symptoms
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
a
supper
to
guard
against
infection
--
a
slice
of
toasted
bread
,
sprinkled
with
,
vinegar
,
and
powdered
with
nutmeg
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
chattering
thus
,
they
proceeded
to
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
Before
supper
could
be
served
,
Dr.
Hodges
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
was
delighted
to
see
the
family
assembled
together
again
,
and
expressed
a
hearty
wish
that
they
might
never
more
be
divided
.
<EOS>
He
watched
Amabel
and
Leonard
carefully
,
and
seemed
annoyed
that
the
former
rather
shunned
than
favoured
the
regards
of
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
Leonard
,
too
,
looked
disconcerted
;
and
though
he
was
in
possession
of
his
mistress
's
promise
,
he
did
not
like
to
reclaim
it
.
<EOS>
During
the
whole
of
the
month
,
he
had
been
constantly
on
the
watch
,
and
had
scarcely
slept
at
night
,
<EOS>
so
anxious
was
he
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
any
communication
taking
place
between
Rochester
and
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
spite
of
all
his
caution
,
it
was
possible
he
might
be
deceived
.
<EOS>
And
when
on
this
,
their
first
meeting
,
she
returned
his
anxious
gaze
with
averted
looks
,
he
felt
all
his
jealous
misgivings
return
.
 
<EOS>
Supper
,
meanwhile
,
proceeded
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
was
in
excellent
spirits
,
and
drank
a
bottle
of
old
sack
with
great
relish
.
<EOS>
Overcome
by
the
sight
of
his
wife
and
children
,
the
grocer
abandoned
himself
to
his
feelings
.
<EOS>
As
to
his
wife
,
she
could
scarcely
contain
herself
,
but
wept
and
laughed
by
turns
--
now
embracing
her
husband
,
now
her
son
,
between
whom
she
had
placed
herself
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
she
forget
Doctor
Hodges
;
and
such
was
the
exuberance
of
her
satisfaction
,
that
when
the
repast
was
ended
,
she
arose
,
and
,
flinging
her
arms
about
his
neck
,
termed
him
the
preserver
of
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
any
one
is
entitled
to
that
appellation
it
is
his
father
,
"
replied
Hodges
,
"
and
I
may
say
,
that
in
all
my
experience
I
have
never
witnessed
such
generous
self
-
devotion
as
Mr.
Bloundel
has
exhibited
towards
his
son
.
<EOS>
You
must
now
be
satisfied
,
madam
,
that
no
person
can
so
well
judge
what
is
proper
for
the
safety
of
his
family
as
your
husband
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
doubted
it
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
apprise
you
,
then
,
that
he
has
conceived
a
plan
by
which
he
trusts
to
secure
you
and
his
children
and
household
from
any
future
attack
,
"
returned
Hodges
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
care
not
what
it
is
,
so
it
does
not
separate
me
from
him
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
does
not
,
"
replied
the
grocer
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
knit
us
more
closely
together
than
we
have
yet
been
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
shut
up
my
house
,
having
previously
stored
it
with
provisions
for
a
twelvemonth
,
and
shall
suffer
no
member
of
my
family
to
stir
forth
as
long
as
the
plague
endures
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
ready
to
remain
within
doors
,
if
it
continues
twenty
years
,
"
replied
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
But
how
long
do
you
think
it
_
will
<EOS>
_
last
,
doctor
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Till
next
December
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
"
returned
Hodges
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
long
?
"
exclaimed
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
so
long
,
"
repeated
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
It
has
scarcely
begun
now
.
<EOS>
Your
father
is
right
to
adopt
these
precautions
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
only
way
to
insure
the
safety
of
his
family
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But----
"
cried
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
resolved
,
"
interrupted
Bloundel
,
peremptorily
.
<EOS>
"
Who
ever
leaves
the
house
--
if
but
for
a
moment
--
never
returns
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
when
do
you
close
it
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
week
hence
,
"
replied
the
grocer
;
"
as
soon
as
I
have
laid
in
a
sufficient
stock
of
provisions
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
am
I
not
to
leave
the
house
for
a
year
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Amabel
,
with
a
dissatisfied
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
wish
to
leave
it
?
"
<EOS>
asked
her
father
,
curiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
why
?
"
repeated
Leonard
,
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
Amabel
seemed
confused
,
and
looked
from
her
father
to
Leonard
.
<EOS>
The
former
,
however
,
did
not
notice
her
embarrassment
,
but
observed
to
Hodges--"I
shall
begin
to
victual
the
house
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Amabel
,
"
whispered
Leonard
,
"
you
told
me
if
I
claimed
your
hand
in
a
month
,
you
would
yield
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
require
the
fulfilment
of
your
promise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
till
to
-
morrow
,
"
she
replied
,
distractedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
seen
Rochester
,
"
muttered
the
apprentice
,
turning
away
.
  
<EOS>
II
.
 
<EOS>
IN
WHAT
MANNER
<EOS>
THE
GROCER
VICTUALLED
HIS
HOUSE
.
 
<EOS>
Leonard
Holt
was
wrong
in
his
suspicions
.
<EOS>
Amabel
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
from
Rochester
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
the
truth
must
be
told
,
he
was
never
out
of
her
mind
,
and
she
found
,
to
her
cost
,
that
the
heart
will
not
be
controlled
.
<EOS>
Convinced
of
her
noble
lover
's
perfidy
,
and
aware
she
was
acting
wrongfully
in
cherishing
a
passion
for
him
,
after
the
exposure
of
his
base
designs
towards
herself
,
no
reasoning
of
which
she
was
capable
could
banish
him
from
her
thoughts
,
or
enable
her
to
transfer
her
affections
to
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
This
conflict
of
feeling
produced
its
natural
result
.
<EOS>
She
became
thoughtful
and
dejected
--
was
often
in
tears
--
had
no
appetite
--
and
could
scarcely
rouse
herself
sufficiently
to
undertake
any
sort
of
employment
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
watched
her
with
great
anxiety
,
and
feared
--
though
she
sought
to
disguise
it
from
herself
--
what
was
the
real
cause
of
her
despondency
.
 
<EOS>
Things
were
in
this
position
at
the
end
of
the
month
,
and
it
occasioned
no
surprise
to
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
though
it
afflicted
her
deeply
,
to
find
that
Amabel
sedulously
avoided
the
apprentice
's
regards
on
their
first
meeting
.
<EOS>
When
Doctor
Hodges
was
gone
,
and
the
rest
of
the
family
had
retired
,
she
remarked
to
her
husband
,
"
Before
you
shut
up
the
house
as
you
propose
,
I
should
,
wish
one
important
matter
settled
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
grocer
inquired
what
she
meant
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
wish
to
have
Amabel
married
,
"
was
the
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Married
!
"
exclaimed
Bloundel
,
in
astonishment
.
"
<EOS>
To
whom
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
Leonard
Holt
.
"
 
<EOS>
Bloundel
could
scarcely
repress
his
displeasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
time
enough
to
talk
of
that
a
year
hence
,
"
he
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
so
,
"
returned
his
wife
;
"
and
now
,
since
the
proper
time
for
the
disclosure
of
the
secret
has
arrived
,
I
must
tell
you
that
the
gallant
who
called
himself
Maurice
Wyvil
,
and
whom
you
so
much
dreaded
,
was
no
other
than
the
Earl
of
Rochester
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Rochester
!
"
echoed
the
grocer
,
while
an
angry
flush
stained
his
cheek
;
"
has
that
libertine
dared
to
enter
my
house
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
and
more
than
once
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
cried
her
husband
,
with
difficulty
controlling
his
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
was
he
here?--tell
me
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
wife
then
proceeded
to
relate
all
that
had
occurred
,
and
he
listened
with
profound
attention
to
her
recital
.
<EOS>
At
its
close
,
he
arose
and
paced
the
chamber
for
some
time
in
great
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
suddenly
paused
,
and
,
regarding
his
wife
with
great
sternness
,
observed
,
in
a
severe
tone
,
"
You
have
done
very
wrong
in
concealing
this
from
me
,
Honora
--
very
wrong
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
have
erred
,
it
was
to
spare
you
uneasiness
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
bursting
into
tears
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
agreed
with
me
that
it
was
better
not
to
mention
the
subject
while
you
had
so
many
other
anxieties
pressing
upon
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
stout
heart
,
and
a
firm
reliance
on
the
goodness
of
Heaven
,
which
will
enable
me
to
bear
up
against
most
evils
,
"
returned
the
grocer
.
"
<EOS>
But
on
this
point
I
ought
,
under
any
circumstances
,
to
have
been
consulted
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
greatly
surprised
that
Doctor
Hodges
should
advise
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
influenced
,
like
myself
,
by
the
kindliest
feelings
towards
you
,
"
sobbed
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
I
will
not
reproach
you
further
,
"
returned
the
grocer
,
somewhat
moved
by
her
tears
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
you
conceived
you
were
acting
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
caution
you
against
such
conduct
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
a
pause
,
he
added
,
"
Is
it
your
opinion
that
our
poor
deluded
child
still
entertains
any
regard
for
this
profligate
nobleman
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
she
does
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Bloundel
;
"
and
it
is
from
that
conviction
that
I
so
strongly
urge
the
necessity
of
marrying
her
to
Leonard
Holt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
compel
her
to
do
anything
to
endanger
her
future
happiness
,
"
returned
the
grocer
.
<EOS>
"
She
must
not
marry
Leonard
Holt
without
loving
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
better
to
risk
an
uncertain
evil
,
than
to
rush
upon
a
certain
one
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
wo
n't
answer
for
the
consequences
,
"
replied
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bloundel
;
"
am
I
to
understand
you
have
no
reliance
on
Amabel
?
<EOS>
Has
all
our
care
been
thrown
away
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
distrust
her
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Bloundel
;
"
but
consider
whom
she
has
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
She
is
beset
by
the
handsomest
and
most
fascinating
man
of
the
day
--
by
one
understood
to
be
practised
in
all
the
arts
most
dangerous
to
our
sex
--
and
a
nobleman
to
boot
.
<EOS>
Some
allowance
must
be
made
for
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
none
,
"
rejoined
Bloundel
,
austerely
.
"
<EOS>
She
has
been
taught
to
resist
temptation
in
whatever
guise
it
may
present
itself
;
and
if
the
principles
I
have
endeavoured
to
implant
within
her
breast
had
found
lodgment
there
,
she
_
would
_
have
resisted
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
deeply
grieved
to
find
this
is
not
the
case
,
and
that
she
must
trust
to
others
for
protection
,
when
she
ought
to
be
able
to
defend
herself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
subject
was
not
further
discussed
,
and
the
grocer
and
his
wife
shortly
afterwards
retired
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
,
Bloundel
remarked
to
the
apprentice
as
they
stood
together
in
the
shop
,
"
Leonard
,
you
are
aware
I
am
about
to
shut
up
my
house
.
<EOS>
Before
doing
so
,
I
must
make
certain
needful
arrangements
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
disguise
from
you
that
I
should
prefer
your
remaining
with
me
,
but
at
the
same
time
I
beg
you
distinctly
to
understand
that
I
will
not
detain
you
against
your
will
.
<EOS>
Your
articles
are
within
two
months
of
expiring
;
and
,
if
you
desire
it
,
I
will
deliver
them
to
you
to
-
morrow
,
and
release
you
from
the
rest
of
your
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
desire
it
,
sir
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
"
I
will
remain
as
long
as
I
can
be
serviceable
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Take
time
for
reflection
,
"
rejoined
his
master
,
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
all
probability
,
it
will
be
a
long
confinement
,
and
you
may
repent
,
when
too
late
,
having
subjected
yourself
to
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Last
month
's
experience
has
taught
me
what
I
have
to
expect
,
"
remarked
Leonard
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
My
mind
is
made
up
,
I
will
stay
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
it
,
"
returned
Bloundel
,
"
and
now
I
have
something
further
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
My
wife
has
acquainted
me
with
the
daring
attempt
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
to
carry
off
Amabel
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Has
my
mistress
,
also
,
told
you
of
my
attachment
to
your
daughter
?
"
demanded
Leonard
,
trembling
,
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
maintain
a
show
of
calmness
.
 
<EOS>
Bloundel
nodded
an
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
of
Amabel
's
promise
to
bestow
her
hand
upon
me
,
if
I
claimed
it
at
the
month
's
end
?
"
continued
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
replied
the
grocer
,
a
good
deal
<EOS>
surprised--"I
heard
of
no
such
promise
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
I
aware
the
matter
had
gone
so
far
.
<EOS>
But
have
you
claimed
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
"
but
she
declined
giving
an
answer
till
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
have
it
,
then
,
at
once
,
"
cried
Bloundel
"
Come
with
me
to
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
led
the
way
to
the
inner
room
,
where
they
found
Amabel
and
her
mother
.
<EOS>
At
the
sight
of
Leonard
,
the
former
instantly
cast
down
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Amabel
,
"
said
her
father
,
in
a
tone
of
greater
severity
than
he
had
ever
before
used
towards
her
,
"
all
that
has
passed
is
known
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
take
another
and
more
fitting
opportunity
to
speak
to
you
on
your
ill
-
advised
conduct
.
<EOS>
I
am
come
for
a
different
purpose
.
<EOS>
You
have
given
Leonard
Holt
a
promise
(
I
need
not
tell
you
of
what
nature
)
,
and
he
claims
its
fulfilment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
insists
upon
my
compliance
,
"
replied
Amabel
,
in
a
tremulous
voice
,
"
I
must
obey
.
<EOS>
But
it
will
make
me
wretched
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
at
once
release
you
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
value
your
happiness
far
more
than
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
deserve
better
treatment
,
Leonard
,
"
said
Bloundel
;
"
and
I
am
sorry
my
daughter
can
not
discern
what
is
for
her
good
.
<EOS>
Let
us
hope
that
time
will
work
a
change
in
your
favour
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
,
bitterly
;
"
I
will
no
longer
delude
myself
with
any
such
vain
expectation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Amabel
,
"
observed
the
grocer
,
"
as
your
father
--
as
your
wellwisher
--
I
should
desire
to
see
you
wedded
to
Leonard
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
told
your
mother
,
and
now
tell
you
,
that
I
will
not
control
your
inclinations
,
and
will
only
attempt
to
direct
you
so
far
as
I
think
likely
to
be
conducive
to
your
happiness
.
<EOS>
On
another
point
,
I
must
assume
a
very
different
tone
.
<EOS>
You
can
no
longer
plead
ignorance
of
the
designs
of
the
depraved
person
who
besets
you
.
<EOS>
You
may
not
be
able
to
forget
him
--
but
you
can
avoid
him
.
<EOS>
If
you
see
him
alone
again
--
if
but
for
a
moment
--
I
cast
you
off
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
for
ever
,
"
he
repeated
,
with
stern
emphasis
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
voluntarily
see
him
again
,
"
replied
Amabel
,
tremblingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
heard
my
determination
,
"
rejoined
her
father
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
still
adhere
to
your
resolution
of
remaining
with
me
,
Leonard
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
turning
to
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
If
what
has
just
passed
makes
any
alteration
in
your
wishes
,
state
so
,
frankly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
stay
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
will
be
one
advantage
,
which
I
did
not
foresee
,
in
closing
my
house
,
"
remarked
the
grocer
aside
to
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
effectually
keep
away
this
libertine
earl
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
so
,
"
replied
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
have
more
faith
in
my
own
vigilance
than
in
bolts
and
bars
.
<EOS>
"
 
Bloundel
and
Leonard
then
returned
to
the
shop
,
where
the
former
immediately
began
to
make
preparations
for
storing
his
house
;
and
in
the
prosecution
of
his
scheme
he
was
greatly
aided
by
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
The
grocer
's
dwelling
,
as
has
been
stated
,
was
large
and
commodious
.
<EOS>
It
was
three
stories
high
;
and
beneath
the
ground
-
floor
there
were
kitchens
and
extensive
cellars
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
rooms
were
spacious
,
and
had
curiously
carved
fireplaces
,
walls
pannelled
with
fine
brown
oak
,
large
presses
,
and
cupboards
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
yard
,
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
there
was
a
pump
,
from
which
excellent
water
was
obtained
.
<EOS>
There
were
likewise
three
large
cisterns
,
supplied
from
the
New
River
.
<EOS>
Not
satisfied
with
this
,
and
anxious
to
obtain
water
in
which
no
infected
body
could
have
lain
,
or
clothes
have
been
washed
,
Bloundel
had
a
large
tank
placed
within
the
cellar
,
and
connecting
it
by
pipes
with
the
pump
,
he
contrived
an
ingenious
machine
,
by
which
he
could
work
the
latter
from
within
the
house
--
thus
making
sure
of
a
constant
supply
of
water
direct
from
the
spring
.
 
<EOS>
He
next
addressed
himself
to
the
front
of
the
house
,
where
he
fixed
a
pulley
,
with
a
rope
and
hook
attached
to
it
,
to
the
beam
above
one
of
the
smaller
bay
windows
on
the
second
story
.
<EOS>
By
this
means
,
he
could
let
down
a
basket
or
any
other
article
into
the
street
,
or
draw
up
whatever
he
desired
;
and
as
he
proposed
using
this
outlet
as
the
sole
means
of
communication
with
the
external
world
when
his
house
was
closed
,
he
had
a
wooden
shutter
made
in
the
form
of
a
trap
-
door
,
which
he
could
open
and
shut
at
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
Here
it
was
his
intention
to
station
himself
at
certain
hours
of
the
day
,
and
whenever
he
held
any
communication
below
,
to
flash
off
a
pistol
,
so
that
the
smoke
of
the
powder
might
drive
back
the
air
,
and
purify
any
vapour
that
found
entrance
of
its
noxious
particles
.
 
<EOS>
He
laid
down
to
himself
a
number
of
regulations
,
which
will
be
more
easily
shown
and
more
clearly
understood
,
on
arriving
at
the
period
when
his
plans
came
to
be
in
full
operation
.
<EOS>
To
give
an
instance
,
however
--
if
a
letter
should
be
conveyed
to
him
by
means
of
the
pulley
,
he
proposed
to
steep
it
in
a
solution
of
vinegar
and
sulphur
;
and
when
dried
and
otherwise
fumigated
,
to
read
it
at
a
distance
by
the
help
of
strong
glasses
.
 
<EOS>
In
regard
to
provisions
,
after
a
careful
calculation
,
he
bought
upwards
of
three
thousand
pounds
'
weight
of
hard
sea
-
biscuits
,
similar
to
those
now
termed
captain
's
biscuits
,
and
had
them
stowed
away
in
hogsheads
.
<EOS>
He
next
ordered
twenty
huge
casks
of
the
finest
flour
,
which
he
had
packed
up
with
the
greatest
care
,
as
if
for
a
voyage
to
Barbadoes
or
Jamaica
.
<EOS>
As
these
were
brought
in
through
the
yard
an
accident
had
well
-
nigh
occurred
which
might
have
proved
fatal
to
him
.
<EOS>
While
superintending
the
labours
of
Leonard
and
Blaize
,
who
were
rolling
the
casks
into
the
house
--
having
stowed
away
as
many
as
he
conveniently
could
in
the
upper
part
of
the
premises
--
he
descended
to
the
cellar
,
and
,
opening
a
door
at
the
foot
of
a
flight
of
steps
leading
from
the
yard
,
called
to
them
to
lower
the
remaining
barrels
with
ropes
below
.
<EOS>
In
the
hurry
,
Blaize
rolled
a
cask
towards
the
open
door
,
and
in
another
instant
it
would
have
fallen
upon
the
grocer
,
and
perhaps
have
crushed
him
,
but
for
the
interposition
of
Leonard
.
<EOS>
Bloundel
made
no
remark
at
the
time
;
but
he
never
forgot
the
service
rendered
him
by
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
To
bake
the
bread
required
an
oven
,
and
he
accordingly
built
one
in
the
garret
,
laying
in
a
large
stock
of
wood
for
fuel
.
<EOS>
Neither
did
he
neglect
to
provide
himself
with
two
casks
of
meal
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
most
important
consideration
was
butcher
's
meat
;
and
for
this
purpose
he
went
to
Rotherhithe
,
where
the
plague
had
not
yet
appeared
,
and
agreed
with
a
butcher
to
kill
him
four
fat
bullocks
,
and
pickle
and
barrel
them
as
if
for
sea
stores
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
directed
the
man
to
provide
six
large
barrels
of
pickled
pork
,
on
the
same
understanding
.
<EOS>
These
were
landed
at
Queenhithe
,
and
brought
up
to
Wood
-
street
,
so
that
they
passed
for
newly
-
landed
grocery
.
 
<EOS>
Hams
and
bacon
forming
part
of
his
own
trade
<EOS>
,
he
wrote
to
certain
farmers
with
whom
he
was
in
the
habit
of
dealing
,
to
send
him
up
an
unlimited
supply
of
flitches
and
gammons
;
and
his
orders
being
promptly
and
abundantly
answered
,
he
soon
found
he
had
more
bacon
than
he
could
possibly
consume
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
laid
in
a
good
store
of
tongues
,
hung
beet
,
and
other
dried
meats
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
wine
,
he
already
had
a
tolerable
stock
;
but
he
increased
it
by
half
a
hogshead
of
the
best
canary
he
could
procure
;
two
casks
of
malmsey
,
each
containing
twelve
gallons
;
a
quarter
-
cask
of
Malaga
sack
;
a
runlet
of
muscadine
;
two
small
runlets
of
aqua
vitae
;
twenty
gallons
of
aniseed
water
;
and
two
eight
-
gallon
runlets
of
brandy
.
<EOS>
To
this
he
added
six
hogsheads
of
strongly
-
hopped
Kent
ale
,
calculated
for
keeping
,
which
he
placed
in
a
cool
cellar
,
together
with
three
hogsheads
of
beer
,
for
immediate
use
.
<EOS>
Furthermore
,
he
procured
a
variety
of
distilled
waters
for
medicinal
purposes
,
amongst
which
he
included
a
couple
of
dozen
of
the
then
fashionable
and
costly
preparation
,
denominated
plague
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
As
,
notwithstanding
all
his
precautions
,
it
was
not
impossible
that
some
of
his
household
might
be
attacked
by
the
distemper
,
he
took
care
to
provide
proper
remedies
,
and
,
to
Blaize
's
infinite
delight
,
furnished
himself
with
mithridates
,
Venice
treacle
,
diascorium
,
the
pill
rufus
<EOS>
(
oh
!
how
the
porter
longed
to
have
the
key
of
the
medicine
chest
!
)
,
London
treacle
,
turpentine
,
and
other
matters
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
collected
a
number
of
herbs
and
simples
;
as
Virginian
snakeweed
,
contrajerva
,
pestilence
-
wort
,
angelica
,
elecampane
,
zedoary
,
tormentil
,
valerian
,
lovage
,
devils
-
bit
,
dittany
,
master
-
wort
,
rue
,
sage
,
ivy
-
berries
,
and
walnuts
;
together
with
bole
ammoniac
,
terra
sigillata
,
bezoar
-
water
,
oil
of
sulphur
,
oil
of
vitriol
,
and
other
compounds
.
<EOS>
His
store
of
remedies
was
completed
by
a
tun
of
the
best
white
-
wine
vinegar
,
and
a
dozen
jars
of
salad
-
oil
.
 
<EOS>
Regulating
his
supplies
by
the
provisions
he
had
laid
in
,
he
purchased
a
sufficient
stock
of
coals
and
fagots
to
last
him
during
the
whole
period
of
his
confinement
;
and
he
added
a
small
barrel
of
gunpowder
,
and
a
like
quantity
of
sulphur
for
fumigation
.
 
<EOS>
His
eatables
would
not
have
been
complete
without
cheese
;
and
he
therefore
ordered
about
six
hundredweight
from
Derbyshire
,
Wiltshire
,
and
Leicestershire
,
besides
a
couple
of
large
old
cheeses
from
Rostherne
,
in
Cheshire
--
even
then
noted
for
the
best
dairies
in
the
whole
county
.
<EOS>
Several
tubs
of
salted
butter
were
sent
him
out
of
Berkshire
,
and
a
few
pots
,
from
Suffolk
.
 
<EOS>
It
being
indispensable
,
considering
the
long
period
he
meant
to
close
his
house
,
to
provide
himself
and
his
family
with
every
necessary
,
he
procured
a
sufficient
stock
of
wearing
apparel
,
hose
,
shoes
and
boots
.
<EOS>
Spice
,
dried
fruit
,
and
other
grocery
articles
,
were
not
required
,
because
he
already
possessed
them
.
<EOS>
Candles
also
formed
an
article
of
his
trade
,
and
lamp
-
oil
;
but
he
was
recommended
by
Doctor
Hodges
,
from
a
fear
of
the
scurvy
,
to
provide
a
plentiful
supply
of
lemon
and
lime
juice
.
 
<EOS>
To
guard
against
accident
,
he
also
doubly
stocked
his
house
with
glass
,
earthenware
,
and
every
article
liable
to
breakage
.
<EOS>
He
destroyed
all
vermin
,
such
as
rats
and
mice
,
by
which
the
house
was
infested
;
and
the
only
live
creatures
he
would
suffer
to
be
kept
were
a
few
poultry
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
small
hutch
constructed
near
the
street
-
door
,
to
be
used
by
the
watchman
he
meant
to
employ
;
and
he
had
the
garrets
fitted
up
with
beds
to
form
an
hospital
,
if
any
part
of
the
family
should
be
seized
with
the
distemper
,
so
that
the
sick
might
be
sequestered
from
the
sound
.

THE
QUACK
DOCTORS
.
 
<EOS>
Patience
,
it
may
be
remembered
,
had
promised
Blaize
to
give
him
her
earnings
to
enable
him
to
procure
a
fresh
supply
of
medicine
,
and
about
a
week
after
he
had
received
the
trifling
amount
(
for
he
had
been
so
constantly
employed
by
the
grocer
that
he
had
no
opportunity
of
getting
out
before
)
,
he
sallied
forth
to
visit
a
neighbouring
apothecary
,
named
Parkhurst
,
from
whom
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
purchasing
drugs
,
and
who
occupied
a
small
shop
not
far
from
the
grocer
's
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
.
<EOS>
Parkhurst
appeared
overjoyed
to
see
him
,
and
,
without
giving
him
time
to
prefer
his
own
request
,
inquired
after
his
master
's
family
--
whether
they
were
all
well
,
especially
fair
Mistress
Amabel
--
and
,
further
,
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
large
supplies
of
provision
which
he
saw
daily
conveyed
to
the
premises
?
<EOS>
Blaize
shook
his
head
at
the
latter
question
,
and
for
some
time
refused
to
answer
it
.
<EOS>
But
being
closely
pressed
by
Parkhurst
,
he
admitted
that
his
master
was
about
to
shut
up
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shut
up
his
house
!
"
exclaimed
Parkhurst
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
of
such
a
preposterous
idea
.
<EOS>
If
he
does
so
,
not
one
of
you
will
come
out
alive
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
hope
that
he
will
be
dissuaded
from
his
rash
design
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dissuaded
!
"
echoed
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
my
master
.
<EOS>
He
's
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
when
he
takes
a
thing
into
his
head
.
<EOS>
Nothing
will
turn
him
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
Doctor
Hodges
sanctions
and
even
recommends
the
plan
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
opinion
of
Doctor
Hodges
,
"
sneered
the
apothecary
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
fit
to
hold
a
candle
before
a
learned
friend
of
mine
,
a
physician
,
who
is
now
in
that
room
.
<EOS>
The
person
I
speak
of
thoroughly
understands
the
pestilence
,
and
never
fails
to
cure
every
case
that
comes
before
him
.
<EOS>
No
shutting
up
houses
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
in
possession
of
an
infallible
remedy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Blaize
,
pricking
up
his
ears
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
his
name
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
name
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Parkhurst
,
with
a
puzzled
look
.
<EOS>
"
How
strange
it
should
slip
my
memory
!
<EOS>
Ah
,
now
I
recollect
.
<EOS>
It
is
Doctor
Calixtus
Bottesham
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
singular
name
,
truly
,
"
remarked
Blaize
;
"
but
it
sounds
like
that
of
a
clever
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Calixtus
Bottesham
is
a
wonderful
man
,
"
returned
the
apothecary
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
met
with
his
like
.
<EOS>
I
would
trumpet
forth
his
merits
through
the
whole
city
,
but
that
it
would
ruin
my
trade
.
<EOS>
The
plague
is
our
harvest
,
as
my
friend
Chowles
,
the
coffin
-
maker
,
says
,
and
it
will
not
do
to
stop
it
--
<EOS>
ha
!
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
serious
a
subject
to
laugh
at
,
"
returned
Blaize
,
gravely
.
"
<EOS>
But
are
the
doctor
's
fees
exorbitant
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
the
last
degree
,
"
replied
Parkhurst
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
to
state
how
much
he
asks
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
shall
not
be
able
to
consult
him
,
then
,
"
said
Blaize
,
turning
over
the
coin
in
his
pocket
;
"
<EOS>
and
yet
I
should
greatly
like
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
no
fear
on
that
score
,
"
returned
the
apothecary
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
able
to
render
him
an
important
service
,
and
he
will
do
anything
for
me
.
<EOS>
He
shall
give
you
his
advice
gratis
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
!
<EOS>
thank
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Blaize
,
transported
with
delight
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wait
here
a
moment
,
and
I
will
ascertain
whether
he
will
see
you
,
"
replied
Parkhurst
.
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
quitted
the
porter
,
who
amused
himself
during
his
absence
by
studying
the
labels
affixed
to
the
jars
and
bottles
on
the
shelves
.
<EOS>
He
had
much
ado
to
restrain
himself
from
opening
some
of
them
,
and
tasting
their
contents
.
 
<EOS>
Full
a
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
before
the
apothecary
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
have
detained
you
so
long
,
"
he
said
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
had
more
difficulty
with
the
doctor
than
I
expected
,
and
for
some
time
he
refused
to
see
you
on
any
terms
,
because
he
has
a
violent
antipathy
to
Doctor
Hodges
,
whom
he
regards
as
a
mere
pretender
,
and
whose
patient
he
conceives
you
to
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
Doctor
Hodges
'
patient
,
"
returned
Blaize
;
"
and
I
regard
him
as
a
pretender
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
opinion
will
recommend
you
to
Doctor
Bottesham
,
"
replied
Parkhurst
;
"
and
since
I
have
smoothed
the
way
for
you
,
you
will
find
him
very
affable
and
condescending
.
<EOS>
He
has
often
heard
me
speak
of
your
master
;
and
if
it
were
not
for
his
dislike
of
Doctor
Hodges
,
whom
he
might
accidentally
encounter
,
he
would
call
upon
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
get
my
master
to
employ
him
instead
of
the
other
,
"
said
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
so
too
,
"
cried
Parkhurst
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
think
it
could
be
managed
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
not
,
"
returned
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
would
be
no
harm
in
making
the
trial
,
"
replied
Parkhurst
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
shall
now
see
the
learned
gentleman
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
apprise
you
that
he
has
two
friends
with
him
--
one
a
young
gallant
,
named
Hawkswood
,
whom
he
has
recently
cured
of
the
distemper
,
and
who
is
so
much
attached
to
him
that
he
never
leaves
him
;
the
other
,
a
doctor
,
like
himself
,
named
Martin
Furbisher
,
who
always
accompanies
him
in
his
visits
to
his
patients
,
and
prepares
his
mixtures
for
him
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
be
surprised
at
their
appearance
.
<EOS>
And
now
come
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
led
the
way
into
a
small
room
at
the
back
of
the
shop
,
where
three
personages
were
seated
at
the
table
,
with
a
flask
of
wine
and
glasses
before
them
.
<EOS>
Blaize
detected
Doctor
Bottesham
at
a
glance
.
<EOS>
He
was
an
ancient
-
looking
man
,
clad
in
a
suit
of
rusty
black
,
over
which
was
thrown
a
velvet
robe
,
very
much
soiled
and
faded
,
but
originally
trimmed
with
fur
,
and
lined
with
yellow
silk
.
<EOS>
His
powers
of
vision
appeared
to
be
feeble
,
for
he
wore
a
large
green
shade
over
his
eyes
,
and
a
pair
of
spectacles
of
the
same
colour
.
<EOS>
A
venerable
white
beard
descended
almost
to
his
waist
.
<EOS>
His
head
was
protected
by
a
long
flowing
grey
wig
,
over
which
he
wore
a
black
velvet
cap
.
<EOS>
His
shoulders
were
high
and
round
,
his
back
bent
,
and
he
evidently
required
support
when
he
moved
,
as
a
crutch
-
headed
staff
was
reared
against
his
chair
.
<EOS>
On
his
left
was
a
young
,
handsome
,
and
richly
-
attired
gallant
,
answering
to
the
apothecary
's
description
of
Hawkswood
;
and
on
the
right
sat
a
stout
personage
precisely
habited
like
himself
,
except
that
he
wore
a
broad
-
leaved
hat
,
which
completely
overshadowed
his
features
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
attempt
at
concealment
,
it
was
easy
to
perceive
that
Doctor
Furbisher
's
face
was
covered
with
scars
,
that
he
had
a
rubicund
nose
,
studded
with
carbuncles
,
and
a
black
patch
over
his
left
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
this
the
young
man
who
desires
to
consult
me
?
"
asked
Doctor
Calixtus
Bottesham
,
in
the
cracked
and
quavering
voice
of
old
age
,
of
Parkhurst
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
the
apothecary
,
respectfully
.
"
<EOS>
Go
forward
,
"
he
added
to
Blaize
,
"
and
speak
for
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
ails
you
?
"
<EOS>
pursued
Bottesham
,
gazing
at
him
through
his
spectacles
.
<EOS>
"
You
look
strong
and
hearty
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
am
,
learned
sir
,
"
replied
Blaize
,
bowing
to
the
ground
;
"
but
understanding
from
Mr.
Parkhurst
that
you
have
an
infallible
remedy
against
the
plague
,
I
would
gladly
procure
it
from
you
,
as
,
if
I
should
be
attacked
,
I
may
not
have
an
opportunity
of
consulting
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
demanded
Bottesham
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
come
to
you
if
you
send
for
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
replied
Blaize
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
"
<EOS>
my
master
is
about
to
shut
up
his
house
,
and
no
one
will
be
allowed
to
go
forth
,
or
to
enter
it
,
till
the
pestilence
is
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
master
must
be
mad
to
think
of
such
a
thing
,
"
rejoined
Bottesham
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
say
you
,
brother
Furbisher?--is
<EOS>
that
the
way
to
keep
off
the
plague
?
"
 
"
Gallipots
of
Galen
!
<EOS>
no
,
"
returned
the
other
;
"
it
is
rather
the
way
to
invite
its
assaults
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
When
does
your
master
talk
of
putting
this
fatal
design
--
for
fatal
it
will
be
to
him
and
all
his
household
--
into
execution
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Bottesham
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
shortly
,
I
believe
,
"
replied
Blaize
.
"
<EOS>
He
meant
to
begin
on
the
first
of
June
,
but
as
the
pestilence
is
less
violent
than
it
was
,
Doctor
Hodges
has
induced
him
to
defer
his
purpose
for
a
few
days
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Hodges
!
"
exclaimed
Bottesham
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
an
unfortunate
day
for
your
master
when
he
admitted
that
sack
-
drinking
impostor
into
his
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
great
opinion
of
his
skill
,
"
replied
Blaize
,
"
but
,
nevertheless
,
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
cured
Master
Stephen
in
a
wonderful
manner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pshaw
!
"
exclaimed
Bottesham
,
"
that
was
mere
accident
.
<EOS>
I
heard
the
particulars
of
the
case
from
Parkhurst
,
and
am
satisfied
the
youth
would
have
recovered
without
his
aid
.
<EOS>
But
what
a
barbarian
Mr.
Bloundel
must
be
to
think
of
imprisoning
his
family
in
this
way
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
certainly
does
not
consult
my
inclinations
in
the
matter
,
"
returned
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
those
of
his
wife
and
daughter
,
I
should
imagine
,
"
continued
Bottesham
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
do
_
<EOS>
they
_
<EOS>
like
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
exactly
say
,
"
answered
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
dreadful
thing
it
would
be
if
I
should
be
attacked
by
the
plague
,
and
no
assistance
could
be
procured
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
still
more
dreadful
if
so
angelic
a
creature
as
Bloundel
's
daughter
is
represented
to
be
--
<EOS>
for
I
have
never
seen
her
--
should
be
so
seized
,
"
observed
Bottesham
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
so
much
interested
about
her
that
I
would
do
anything
to
preserve
her
from
the
fate
with
which
she
is
menaced
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Were
it
not
inconsistent
with
your
years
,
learned
sir
,
I
might
suspect
you
of
a
tenderer
feeling
towards
her
,
"
observed
Blaize
,
archly
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
in
good
sooth
,
her
charms
are
so
extraordinary
,
that
I
should
not
be
surprised
at
any
effect
they
might
produce
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
would
produce
no
effect
on
me
,
"
replied
Bottesham
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
long
past
such
feelings
.
<EOS>
But
in
regard
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
say
you
are
afraid
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
an
electuary
to
drive
away
the
panic
;
"
and
he
produced
a
small
jar
,
and
handed
it
to
the
porter
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
composed
of
conserve
of
roses
,
gillyflowers
,
borage
,
candied
citron
,
powder
of
_
laetificans
Galeni
_
,
Roman
zedoary
,
doronicum
,
and
saffron
.
<EOS>
You
must
take
about
the
quantity
of
a
large
nutmeg
,
morning
and
evening
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
make
me
for
ever
your
debtor
,
learned
sir
,
"
rejoined
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
charming
mixture
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
also
add
my
remedy
,
"
said
Furbisher
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
powder
compounded
of
crabs
'
eyes
,
burnt
hartshorn
,
the
black
tops
of
crabs
'
claws
,
the
bone
from
a
stag
's
heart
,
unicorn
's
horn
,
and
salt
of
vipers
.
<EOS>
You
must
take
one
or
two
drams
--
not
more
--
in
a
glass
of
hot
posset
-
drink
,
when
you
go
to
bed
,
and
swallow
another
draught
of
the
same
potion
to
wash
it
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
carefully
observe
your
directions
,
"
replied
Blaize
,
thankfully
receiving
the
powder
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
all
things
,
"
said
Bottesham
,
claiming
the
porter
's
attention
by
tapping
him
on
the
head
with
his
cane
,
"
take
care
never
to
be
without
vinegar
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
grand
specific
,
not
merely
against
the
plague
,
but
against
all
disorders
.
<EOS>
It
is
food
and
physic
,
meat
and
medicine
,
drink
and
julep
,
cordial
and
antidote
.
<EOS>
If
you
formerly
took
it
as
a
sauce
,
now
take
it
as
a
remedy
.
<EOS>
To
the
sound
it
is
a
preservative
from
sickness
,
to
the
sick
,
a
restorative
to
health
.
<EOS>
It
is
like
the
sword
which
is
worn
not
merely
for
ornament
,
but
for
defence
.
<EOS>
Vinegar
is
my
remedy
against
the
plague
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
simple
remedy
,
but
an
effectual
one
.
<EOS>
I
have
cured
a
thousand
patients
with
it
,
and
hope
to
cure
a
thousand
more
.
<EOS>
Take
vinegar
with
all
you
eat
,
and
flavour
all
you
drink
with
it
.
<EOS>
Has
the
plague
taken
away
your
appetite
,
vinegar
will
renew
it
.
<EOS>
Is
your
throat
ulcerated
,
use
vinegar
as
a
gargle
.
<EOS>
Are
you
disturbed
with
phlegmatic
humours
,
vinegar
will
remove
them
.
<EOS>
Is
your
brain
laden
with
vapours
,
throw
vinegar
on
a
hot
shovel
,
and
inhale
its
fumes
,
and
you
will
obtain
instantaneous
relief
.
<EOS>
Have
you
the
headache
,
wet
a
napkin
in
vinegar
,
and
apply
it
to
your
temples
,
and
the
pain
will
cease
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
there
is
no
ailment
that
vinegar
will
not
cure
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
grand
panacea
;
and
may
be
termed
the
elixir
of
long
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
its
virtues
have
not
been
found
out
before
,
"
observed
Blaize
,
innocently
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
surprising
how
slow
men
are
in
discovering
the
most
obvious
truths
,
"
replied
Bottesham
.
"
<EOS>
But
take
my
advice
,
and
never
be
without
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
will
,
"
returned
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
Heaven
be
praised
,
my
master
has
just
ordered
in
three
tuns
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tap
one
of
them
directly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
idea
of
the
vinegar
remedy
is
borrowed
from
Kemp
's
late
treatise
on
the
pestilence
and
its
cure
,
"
muttered
Furbisher
.
<EOS>
"
Before
you
enter
upon
the
new
system
,
young
man
,
"
he
added
aloud
to
Blaize
,
"
let
me
recommend
you
to
fortify
your
stomach
with
a
glass
of
canary
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
pouring
out
a
bumper
,
he
handed
it
to
the
porter
,
who
swallowed
it
at
a
draught
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
said
Bottesham
,
"
to
return
to
this
mad
scheme
of
your
master's
--
<EOS>
is
there
no
way
of
preventing
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
aware
of
none
,
"
replied
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bolts
and
bars
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Furbisher
,
"
something
must
be
done
for
the
fair
Amabel
.
<EOS>
We
owe
it
to
society
not
to
permit
so
lovely
a
creature
to
be
thus
immured
.
<EOS>
What
say
you
,
Hawkswood
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
to
the
gallant
by
his
side
,
who
had
not
hitherto
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
unpardonable
to
permit
it
--
quite
unpardonable
,
"
replied
this
person
.
 
<EOS>
"
Might
not
some
plan
be
devised
to
remove
her
for
a
short
time
,
and
frighten
him
out
of
his
project
?
"
said
Bottesham
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
willingly
assist
in
such
a
scheme
.
<EOS>
I
pledge
you
in
a
bumper
,
young
man
.
<EOS>
You
appear
a
trusty
servant
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
accounted
,
learned
sir
,
"
replied
Blaize
,
upon
whose
brain
the
wine
thus
plentifully
bestowed
began
to
operate--"and
<EOS>
I
may
add
,
justly
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
really
will
be
doing
your
master
a
service
if
you
can
prevent
him
from
committing
this
folly
,
"
rejoined
Bottesham
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
us
have
a
bottle
of
burnt
malmsey
,
with
a
few
bruised
raisins
in
it
,
Mr.
Parkhurst
.
<EOS>
This
poor
young
man
requires
support
.
<EOS>
Be
seated
,
friend
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
some
hesitation
,
Blaize
complied
,
and
while
the
apothecary
went
in
search
of
the
wine
,
he
observed
to
Bottesham
,
"
I
would
gladly
comply
with
your
suggestion
,
learned
sir
,
if
I
saw
any
means
of
doing
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Could
you
not
pretend
to
have
the
plague
?
"
said
Bottesham
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
then
attend
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
afraid
of
playing
such
a
trick
as
that
,
"
replied
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
do
not
see
what
purpose
it
would
answer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
enable
me
to
get
into
the
house
,
"
returned
Bottesham
,
"
and
then
I
might
take
measures
for
Amabel
's
deliverance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
merely
wish
to
get
into
the
house
,
"
replied
Blaize
,
"
that
can
be
easily
managed
.
<EOS>
I
will
admit
you
this
evening
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Without
your
master
's
knowledge
?
"
asked
Bottesham
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
returned
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
he
has
an
apprentice
?
"
said
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
you
mean
Leonard
Holt
,
"
replied
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
we
must
take
care
<EOS>
he
does
n't
see
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
come
about
nine
o'clock
,
he
will
be
engaged
with
my
master
in
putting
away
the
things
in
the
shop
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
punctual
,
"
replied
Bottesham
,
"
and
will
bring
Doctor
Furbisher
with
me
.
<EOS>
We
will
only
stay
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
But
here
comes
the
burnt
malmsey
.
<EOS>
Fill
the
young
man
's
glass
,
Parkhurst
.
<EOS>
I
will
insure
you
against
the
plague
,
if
you
will
follow
my
advice
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
will
you
insure
me
against
my
master
's
displeasure
,
if
he
finds
me
out
?
"
said
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
provide
you
with
a
new
one
,
"
returned
Bottesham
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
serve
me
if
you
wish
to
change
your
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
would
answer
my
purpose
exactly
,
"
thought
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
I
need
never
be
afraid
of
the
plague
if
I
live
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
will
turn
over
your
proposal
,
learned
sir
,
"
he
added
,
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
After
priming
him
with
another
bumper
of
malmsey
,
Blaise
's
new
friends
suffered
him
to
depart
.
<EOS>
On
returning
home
,
he
proceeded
to
his
own
room
,
and
feeling
unusually
drowsy
,
he
threw
himself
on
the
bed
,
and
almost
instantly
dropped
asleep
.
<EOS>
When
he
awoke
,
the
fumes
of
the
liquor
had
,
in
a
great
degree
,
evaporated
,
and
he
recalled
,
with
considerable
self
-
reproach
,
the
promise
he
had
given
,
and
would
gladly
have
recalled
it
,
if
it
had
been
possible
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
now
not
far
from
the
appointed
hour
,
and
he
momentarily
expected
the
arrival
of
the
two
doctors
.
<EOS>
The
only
thing
that
consoled
him
was
the
store
of
medicine
he
had
obtained
,
and
,
locking
it
up
in
his
cupboard
,
he
descended
to
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
his
mother
was
from
home
,
so
that
he
ran
no
risk
from
her
;
and
,
finding
Patience
alone
,
after
some
hesitation
<EOS>
,
he
let
her
into
the
secret
of
his
anticipated
visitors
.
<EOS>
She
was
greatly
surprised
,
and
expressed
much
uneasiness
lest
they
should
be
discovered
;
as
,
if
they
were
so
,
it
would
be
sure
to
bring
them
both
into
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
can
they
want
with
Mistress
Amabel
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
wonder
if
Doctor
Calixtus
Bottesham
,
as
you
call
him
,
turns
out
a
lover
in
disguise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
lover
!
"
exclaimed
Blaize
.
"
<EOS>
Your
silly
head
is
always
running
upon
lovers
.
<EOS>
He
's
an
old
man
--
old
enough
to
be
your
grandfather
,
with
a
long
white
beard
,
reaching
to
his
waist
.
<EOS>
He
a
lover
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
is
much
more
like
one
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
all
that
,
it
looks
suspicious
,
"
returned
Patience
;
"
and
I
shall
have
my
eyes
about
me
on
their
arrival
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Shortly
after
this
,
Blaize
crept
cautiously
up
to
the
back
yard
,
and
,
opening
the
door
,
found
,
as
he
expected
,
Bottesham
and
his
companion
.
<EOS>
Motioning
them
to
follow
him
,
he
led
the
way
to
the
kitchen
,
where
they
arrived
without
observation
.
<EOS>
Patience
eyed
the
new
-
comers
narrowly
,
and
felt
almost
certain
,
from
their
appearance
and
manner
,
that
her
suspicions
were
correct
.
<EOS>
All
doubts
were
removed
when
Bottesham
,
slipping
a
purse
into
her
hand
,
entreated
her
,
on
some
plea
or
other
,
to
induce
Amabel
to
come
into
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
At
first
she
hesitated
;
but
having
a
tender
heart
,
inclining
her
to
assist
rather
than
oppose
the
course
of
any
love
-
affair
,
her
scruples
were
soon
overcome
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
she
hurried
upstairs
,
and
chancing
to
meet
with
her
young
mistress
,
who
was
about
to
retire
to
her
own
chamber
,
entreated
her
to
come
down
with
her
for
a
moment
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
Thinking
it
some
unimportant
matter
,
but
yet
wondering
why
Patience
should
appear
so
urgent
,
Amabel
complied
.
<EOS>
She
was
still
more
perplexed
when
she
saw
the
two
strangers
,
and
would
have
instantly
retired
if
Bottesham
had
not
detained
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
pardon
the
liberty
I
have
taken
in
sending
for
you
,
"
he
said
,
"
when
I
explain
that
I
have
done
so
to
offer
you
counsel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
as
much
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
counsel
you
can
have
to
offer
,
sir
,
as
to
guess
why
you
are
here
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Amabel
,
"
returned
Bottesham
,
in
a
low
tone
,
but
altering
his
voice
,
and
slightly
raising
his
spectacles
so
as
to
disclose
his
features
;
"
it
is
I
--
Maurice
Wyvil
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
in
the
utmost
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
we
should
meet
again
,
"
he
rejoined
;
"
and
I
have
kept
my
word
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Think
not
to
deceive
me
,
my
lord
,
"
she
returned
,
controlling
her
emotion
by
a
powerful
effort
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
aware
you
are
not
Maurice
Wyvil
,
but
the
Earl
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
Your
love
is
as
false
as
your
character
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Mallet
is
the
real
object
of
your
regards
.
<EOS>
You
see
I
am
acquainted
with
your
perfidy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Amabel
,
you
are
deceived
,
"
replied
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
On
my
soul
,
you
are
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
an
opportunity
of
explaining
myself
more
fully
,
I
will
prove
to
you
that
I
was
induced
by
the
king
,
for
an
especial
purpose
,
to
pay
feigned
addresses
to
the
lady
you
have
named
.
<EOS>
But
I
never
loved
her
.
<EOS>
You
alone
are
the
possessor
of
my
heart
,
and
shall
be
the
sharer
of
my
title
.
<EOS>
You
shall
be
Countess
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Could
I
believe
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
_
may
_
believe
me
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
blight
my
hopes
and
your
own
happiness
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
Your
father
is
about
to
shut
up
his
house
for
a
twelvemonth
,
if
the
plague
lasts
so
long
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
we
shall
meet
no
more
,
for
access
to
you
will
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
Do
not
hesitate
,
or
you
will
for
ever
rue
your
irresolution
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
what
to
do
,
"
cried
Amabel
,
distractedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
decide
for
you
,
"
replied
the
earl
,
grasping
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
 
<EOS>
While
this
was
passing
,
Furbisher
,
or
rather
,
as
will
be
surmised
,
Pillichody
,
had
taken
Blaize
aside
,
and
engaged
his
attention
by
dilating
upon
the
efficacy
of
a
roasted
onion
filled
with
treacle
in
the
expulsion
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
Patience
stationed
herself
near
the
door
,
not
with
a
view
of
interfering
with
the
lovers
,
but
rather
of
assisting
them
;
and
at
the
very
moment
that
the
earl
seized
his
mistress
's
hand
,
and
would
have
drawn
her
forward
,
she
ran
towards
them
,
and
hastily
whispered
,
"
Leonard
Holt
is
coming
downstairs
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
am
lost
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fear
nothing
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Keep
near
me
,
and
I
will
soon
dispose
of
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
the
apprentice
entered
the
kitchen
,
and
,
greatly
surprised
by
the
appearance
of
the
strangers
,
angrily
demanded
from
Blaize
who
they
were
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
two
doctors
come
to
give
me
advice
respecting
the
plague
,
"
stammered
the
porter
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
did
they
get
into
the
house
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
let
them
in
through
the
back
door
,
"
replied
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
let
them
out
by
the
same
way
,
"
rejoined
the
apprentice
.
"
<EOS>
May
I
ask
what
you
are
doing
here
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
to
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
to
you
,
fellow
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Rochester
,
in
his
assumed
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Much
,
as
you
shall
find
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
;
"
for
,
in
spite
of
your
disguise
,
I
know
you
.
<EOS>
Quit
the
house
instantly
with
your
companion
,
or
I
will
give
the
alarm
,
and
Amabel
well
knows
what
the
consequences
will
be
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
go
,
my
lord
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
stir
unless
you
accompany
me
,
"
said
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
have
no
alternative
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
your
father
's
determination
--
I
would
willingly
spare
you
,
Amabel
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
goodness
!
<EOS>
what
_
will
_
become
of
us
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Patience--"if
<EOS>
there
is
n't
Mr.
Bloundel
coming
downstairs
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Amabel
,
"
said
Leonard
,
sternly
,
"
the
next
moment
decides
your
fate
.
<EOS>
If
the
earl
departs
,
I
will
keep
your
secret
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
hear
that
,
my
lord
,
"
she
cried
;
"
I
command
you
to
leave
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
disengaging
herself
from
him
,
and
hastily
passing
her
father
,
who
at
that
moment
entered
the
kitchen
,
she
rushed
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
On
hearing
the
alarm
of
the
grocer
's
approach
,
Pillichody
took
refuge
in
a
cupboard
,
the
door
of
which
stood
invitingly
open
,
so
that
Bloundel
only
perceived
the
earl
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
gazing
around
him
.
<EOS>
"
Whom
have
we
here
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
quack
doctor
,
whom
Blaize
has
been
consulting
about
the
plague
,
"
returned
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
him
instantly
out
of
the
house
,
"
rejoined
the
grocer
,
angrily
,
"
and
take
care
<EOS>
he
never
enters
it
again
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
no
such
charlatans
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
motioned
Rochester
to
follow
him
,
and
the
latter
reluctantly
obeyed
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Bloundel
had
retired
,
Leonard
,
who
had
meanwhile
provided
himself
with
his
cudgel
,
descended
to
the
kitchen
,
where
he
dragged
Pillichody
from
his
hiding
-
place
,
and
conducted
him
to
the
back
door
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
suffer
him
to
depart
without
belabouring
him
soundly
.
<EOS>
Locking
the
door
,
he
then
went
in
search
of
Blaize
,
and
administered
a
similar
chastisement
to
him
.

THE
TWO
WATCHMEN
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
day
following
the
events
last
related
,
as
Leonard
Holt
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
shop,--his
master
having
just
been
called
out
by
some
important
business,--a
man
in
the
dress
of
a
watchman
,
with
a
halberd
in
his
hand
,
approached
him
,
and
inquired
if
he
was
Mr.
Bloundel
's
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
Before
returning
an
answer
,
Leonard
looked
hard
at
the
newcomer
,
and
thought
he
had
never
beheld
so
ill
-
favoured
a
person
before
.
<EOS>
Every
feature
in
his
face
was
distorted
.
<EOS>
His
mouth
was
twisted
on
one
side
,
his
nose
on
the
other
,
while
his
right
eyebrow
was
elevated
more
than
an
inch
above
the
left
;
added
to
which
he
squinted
intolerably
,
had
a
long
fell
of
straight
sandy
hair
,
a
sandy
beard
and
moustache
,
and
a
complexion
of
the
colour
of
brickdust
.
 
<EOS>
"
An
ugly
dog
,
"
muttered
Leonard
to
himself
,
as
he
finished
his
scrutiny
;
"
what
can
he
want
with
me
?
<EOS>
Suppose
I
should
be
Mr.
Bloundel
's
apprentice
,
"
he
added
,
aloud
,
"
<EOS>
what
then
,
friend
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
master
has
a
beautiful
daughter
,
has
he
not
?
"
asked
the
ill
-
favoured
watchman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
answer
no
idle
questions
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
,
coldly
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
you
please
,
"
returned
the
other
,
in
an
offended
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
plan
to
carry
her
off
has
accidentally
come
to
my
knowledge
.
<EOS>
But
,
since
incivility
is
all
I
am
likely
to
get
for
my
pains
in
coming
to
acquaint
you
with
it
,
e'en
find
it
out
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
cried
the
apprentice
,
detaining
him
;
"
I
meant
no
offence
.
<EOS>
Step
indoors
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
We
can
converse
there
more
freely
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
watchman
,
who
,
notwithstanding
his
ill
-
looks
,
appeared
to
be
a
good
-
natured
fellow
,
was
easily
appeased
.
<EOS>
Following
the
apprentice
into
the
shop
,
on
the
promise
of
a
handsome
reward
,
he
instantly
commenced
his
relation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Last
night
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
was
keeping
watch
at
the
door
of
Mr.
Brackley
,
a
saddler
in
Aldermanbury
,
whose
house
having
been
attacked
by
the
pestilence
is
now
shut
up
,
when
I
observed
two
persons
,
rather
singularly
attired
,
pass
me
.
<EOS>
Both
were
dressed
like
old
men
,
but
neither
their
gait
nor
tone
of
voice
corresponded
with
their
garb
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
have
been
the
Earl
of
Rochester
and
his
companion
,
"
remarked
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
for
I
afterwards
heard
one
of
them
addressed
by
that
title
.
<EOS>
But
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
much
struck
by
the
strangeness
of
their
appearance
,
that
I
left
my
post
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
followed
them
.
<EOS>
They
halted
beneath
a
gateway
,
and
,
as
they
conversed
together
very
earnestly
,
and
in
a
loud
tone
,
I
could
distinctly
hear
what
they
said
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
,
the
stoutest
of
the
two
,
complained
bitterly
of
the
indignities
he
had
received
from
Mr.
Bloundel
's
apprentice
(
meaning
you
,
of
course
)
,
averring
that
nothing
but
his
devotion
to
his
companion
had
induced
him
to
submit
to
them
;
and
affirming
,
with
many
tremendous
oaths
,
that
he
would
certainly
cut
the
young
man
's
throat
the
very
first
opportunity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
shall
not
want
it
then
,
"
replied
Leonard
contemptuously
;
"
neither
shall
he
lack
a
second
application
of
my
cudgel
when
we
meet
.
<EOS>
But
what
of
his
companion
?
<EOS>
What
did
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
laughed
heartily
at
the
other
's
complaints
,
"
returned
the
watchman
,
"
and
told
him
to
make
himself
easy
,
for
he
should
soon
have
his
revenge
.
'
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
night
,
'
he
said
,
'
we
will
carry
off
Amabel
,
in
spite
of
the
apprentice
or
her
father
;
and
,
as
I
am
equally
indebted
with
yourself
to
the
latter
,
we
will
pay
off
old
scores
with
him
.
'
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
they
intend
to
effect
their
purpose
?
"
demanded
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
can
not
precisely
tell
,
"
replied
the
watchman
.
<EOS>
"
All
I
could
hear
was
,
that
they
meant
to
enter
the
house
by
the
back
yard
about
midnight
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
if
you
will
make
it
worth
my
while
,
I
will
help
you
to
catch
them
in
their
own
trap
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hum
!
"
said
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
name
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Gregory
Swindlehurst
,
"
replied
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
help
me
,
you
must
keep
watch
with
me
to
-
night
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
Can
you
do
so
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
nothing
to
hinder
me
,
provided
I
am
paid
for
my
trouble
,
"
replied
Gregory
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
find
some
one
to
take
my
place
at
Mr.
Brackley
's
.
<EOS>
At
what
hour
shall
I
come
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Soon
after
ten
,
"
said
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Be
at
the
shop
-
door
,
and
I
will
let
you
in
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Count
upon
me
,
"
rejoined
Gregory
,
a
smile
of
satisfaction
illumining
his
ill
-
favoured
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
bring
a
comrade
with
me
?
<EOS>
I
know
a
trusty
fellow
who
would
like
the
job
.
<EOS>
If
Lord
Rochester
should
have
his
companions
with
him
,
assistance
will
be
required
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
Is
your
comrade
a
watchman
,
like
yourself
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
an
old
soldier
,
who
has
been
lately
employed
to
keep
guard
over
infected
houses
,
"
replied
Gregory
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
take
care
<EOS>
his
lordship
does
not
overreach
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
gets
into
the
house
without
my
knowledge
,
I
will
forgive
him
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
wo
n't
get
into
it
without
mine
,
"
muttered
Gregory
,
significantly
.
<EOS>
"
But
do
you
not
mean
to
warn
Mistress
Amabel
of
her
danger
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
consider
of
it
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Mr.
Bloundel
entered
the
shop
,
and
Leonard
,
feigning
to
supply
his
companion
with
a
small
packet
of
grocery
,
desired
him
,
in
a
low
tone
,
to
be
punctual
to
his
appointment
,
and
dismissed
him
.
<EOS>
In
justice
to
the
apprentice
,
it
must
be
stated
that
he
had
no
wish
for
concealment
,
but
was
most
anxious
to
acquaint
his
master
with
the
information
he
had
just
obtained
,
and
was
only
deterred
from
doing
so
by
a
dread
of
the
consequences
it
might
produce
to
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
The
evening
passed
off
much
as
usual
.
<EOS>
The
family
assembled
at
prayer
;
and
.
<EOS>
Blaize
,
whose
shoulders
still
ached
with
the
chastisement
he
had
received
,
eyed
the
apprentice
with
sullen
and
revengeful
looks
.
<EOS>
Patience
,
too
,
was
equally
angry
,
and
her
indignation
was
evinced
in
a
manner
so
droll
,
that
at
another
season
it
would
have
drawn
a
smile
from
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
Supper
over
,
Amabel
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
Leonard
followed
her
,
and
overtook
her
on
the
landing
of
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Amabel
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
have
received
certain
intelligence
that
the
Earl
of
Rochester
will
make
another
attempt
to
enter
the
house
,
and
carry
you
off
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
when
will
he
cease
from
persecuting
me
?
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
you
cease
to
encourage
him
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
,
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
_
<EOS>
not
_
encourage
him
,
Leonard
,
"
she
rejoined
,
"
and
to
prove
that
I
do
not
,
I
will
act
in
any
way
you
think
proper
tonight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
could
trust
you
,
"
said
Leonard
,
you
might
be
of
the
greatest
service
in
convincing
the
earl
that
his
efforts
are
fruitless
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
_
may
_
trust
me
,
"
she
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
returned
Leonard
,
"
when
the
family
have
retired
to
rest
,
come
downstairs
,
and
I
will
tell
you
what
to
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
Hastily
promising
compliance
,
Amabel
disappeared
;
and
Leonard
ran
down
the
stairs
,
at
the
foot
of
which
he
encountered
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
she
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
--
nothing
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
,
evasively
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
-
will
not
serve
my
turn
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
Something
,
I
am
certain
,
troubles
you
,
though
you
do
not
choose
to
confess
it
.
<EOS>
Heaven
grant
<EOS>
your
anxiety
is
not
occasioned
by
aught
relating
to
that
wicked
Earl
of
Rochester
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
sleep
in
my
bed
for
thinking
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
noticed
that
you
followed
Amabel
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
do
not
suspect
anything
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
question
me
further
,
madam
,
I
entreat
,
"
returned
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
Whatever
I
may
suspect
,
I
have
taken
all
needful
precautions
.
<EOS>
Rest
easy
,
and
sleep
soundly
,
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
All
will
go
well
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
rest
easy
,
Leonard
,
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
"
till
you
are
wedded
to
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
Then
,
indeed
,
I
shall
feel
happy
.
<EOS>
My
poor
child
,
I
am
sure
,
is
fully
aware
how
indiscreet
her
conduct
has
been
;
and
when
this
noble
libertine
desists
from
annoying
her
--
or
rather
,
when
he
is
effectually
shut
out
--
we
may
hope
for
a
return
of
her
regard
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
vain
hope
,
madam
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
"
there
will
be
no
such
return
.
<EOS>
I
neither
expect
it
nor
desire
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
ceased
to
love
her
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
in
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ceased
to
love
her
!
"
<EOS>
echoed
Leonard
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
I
had
done
so!--would
<EOS>
I
_
could
_
do
so
!
<EOS>
I
love
her
too
well
--
too
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
repeating
the
words
to
himself
with
great
bitterness
,
he
hurried
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
passion
has
disturbed
his
brain
,
"
sighed
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
as
she
proceeded
to
her
chamber
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
try
to
reason
him
into
calmness
to
-
morrow
.
"
 
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
after
this
,
the
grocer
retired
for
the
night
;
and
Leonard
,
who
had
gone
to
his
own
room
,
cautiously
opened
the
door
,
and
repaired
to
the
shop
.
<EOS>
On
the
way
he
met
Amabel
.
<EOS>
She
looked
pale
as
death
,
and
trembled
so
violently
,
that
she
could
scarcely
support
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
do
not
mean
to
use
any
violence
towards
the
earl
,
Leonard
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
in
a
supplicating
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
will
never
repeat
his
visit
,
"
rejoined
the
apprentice
,
gloomily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
looks
terrify
me
,
"
cried
Amabel
,
gazing
with
great
uneasiness
at
his
stern
and
determined
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
remain
by
you
.
<EOS>
He
will
depart
at
my
bidding
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
he
depart
at
your
bidding
before
?
"
demanded
Leonard
,
sarcastically
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
did
not
,
I
grant
,
"
she
replied
,
more
supplicatingly
than
before
.
"
<EOS>
But
do
not
harm
him
--
for
mercy
's
sake
,
do
not
--
take
my
life
sooner
.
<EOS>
I
alone
have
offended
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
apprentice
made
no
reply
,
but
,
unlocking
a
box
,
took
out
a
brace
of
large
horse
-
pistols
and
a
sword
,
and
thrust
them
into
his
girdle
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mean
to
use
those
murderous
weapons
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
depends
on
circumstances
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
Force
must
be
met
by
force
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Nay
,
then
,
"
she
rejoined
,
"
the
affair
assumes
too
serious
an
aspect
to
be
trifled
with
.
<EOS>
I
will
instantly
alarm
my
father
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
so
,
"
retorted
Leonard
,
"
and
he
will
cast
you
off
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Better
that
,
than
be
the
cause
of
bloodshed
,
"
she
returned
.
<EOS>
"
But
is
there
nothing
I
can
do
to
prevent
this
fatal
result
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
Make
your
lover
understand
he
is
unwelcome
to
you
.
<EOS>
Dismiss
him
for
ever
.
<EOS>
On
that
condition
,
he
shall
depart
unharmed
and
freely
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
so
,
"
she
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
more
was
then
said
.
<EOS>
Amabel
seated
herself
and
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
Leonard
,
who
,
avoiding
her
regards
,
stationed
himself
near
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
a
slight
tap
was
heard
without
,
and
the
apprentice
cautiously
admitted
Gregory
Swindlehurst
and
his
comrade
.
<EOS>
The
latter
was
habited
like
the
other
watchman
,
in
a
blue
night
-
rail
,
and
was
armed
with
a
halberd
.
<EOS>
He
appeared
much
stouter
,
much
older
,
and
,
so
far
as
could
be
discovered
of
his
features
--
for
a
large
handkerchief
muffled
his
face
--
much
uglier
(
if
that
were
possible
)
than
his
companion
.
<EOS>
He
answered
to
the
name
of
Bernard
Boutefeu
.
<EOS>
They
had
no
sooner
entered
the
shop
,
than
Leonard
locked
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
are
these
persons
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Amabel
,
rising
in
great
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Two
watchmen
whom
I
have
hired
to
guard
the
house
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
come
to
protect
you
,
fair
mistress
,
"
said
Gregory
,
"
and
,
if
need
be
,
to
cut
the
Earl
of
Rochester
's
throat
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
heavens
!
"
exclaimed
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ghost
of
Tarquin
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Boutefeu
,
"
we
'll
teach
him
to
break
into
the
houses
of
quiet
citizens
,
and
attempt
to
carry
off
their
daughters
against
their
will
.
<EOS>
By
the
soul
of
Dick
Whittington
,
Lord
Mayor
of
London
!
<EOS>
we
'll
maul
and
mangle
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Silence
!
<EOS>
Bernard
Boutefeu
,
"
interposed
Gregory
.
<EOS>
"
You
frighten
Mistress
Amabel
by
your
strange
oaths
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
sorry
to
do
that
,
"
replied
Boutefeu--"I
only
wish
to
show
my
zeal
for
her
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afraid
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
fair
mistress
.
<EOS>
With
all
his
audacity
,
he
wo
n't
dare
to
enter
the
house
when
he
finds
we
are
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
your
pleasure
that
we
should
thrust
a
halberd
through
his
body
,
or
lodge
a
bullet
in
his
brain
?
"
asked
Gregory
,
appealing
to
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Touch
him
not
<EOS>
,
I
beseech
you
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
Leonard
,
I
have
your
promise
that
,
if
I
can
prevail
upon
him
to
depart
,
you
will
not
molest
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
hear
that
,
"
she
observed
to
the
watchmen
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
all
obedience
,
"
said
Gregory
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bless
your
tender
heart
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Boutefeu
,
"
we
would
not
pain
you
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
truce
to
this
,
"
said
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
Come
to
the
yard
,
we
will
wait
for
him
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
with
you
,
"
cried
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
If
any
harm
should
befall
him
,
I
should
never
forgive
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Remember
what
I
told
you
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
,
sternly
;
"
it
depends
upon
yourself
whether
he
leaves
the
house
alive
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heed
him
not
,
"
whispered
Gregory
.
<EOS>
"
I
and
my
comrade
will
obey
no
one
but
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Amabel
could
not
repress
an
exclamation
of
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
muttering
,
sirrah
?
"
demanded
Leonard
,
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
that
the
young
lady
may
depend
on
our
fidelity
,
"
replied
Gregory
.
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
no
offence
in
that
.
<EOS>
Come
with
us
,
"
he
whispered
to
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
part
of
his
speech
escaped
Leonard
,
but
the
tone
in
which
it
was
uttered
was
so
significant
,
that
Amabel
,
who
began
to
entertain
new
suspicions
,
hesitated
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
come
,
"
said
Leonard
,
seizing
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
fault
be
his
,
not
mine
,
"
murmured
Amabel
,
as
she
suffered
herself
to
be
drawn
along
.
 
<EOS>
The
party
then
proceeded
noiselessly
towards
the
yard
.
<EOS>
On
the
way
,
Amabel
felt
a
slight
pressure
on
her
arm
,
but
,
afraid
of
alarming
Leonard
,
she
made
no
remark
.
 
<EOS>
The
back
-
door
was
opened
,
and
the
little
group
stood
in
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
long
to
wait
.
<EOS>
Before
they
had
been
in
the
yard
five
minutes
,
a
noise
was
heard
of
footsteps
and
muttered
voices
in
the
entry
.
<EOS>
This
was
followed
by
a
sound
like
that
occasioned
by
fastening
a
rope
-
ladder
against
the
wall
,
and
the
next
moment
two
figures
were
perceived
above
it
.
<EOS>
After
dropping
the
ladder
into
the
yard
,
these
persons
,
the
foremost
of
whom
the
apprentice
concluded
was
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
descended
.
<EOS>
They
had
no
sooner
touched
the
ground
than
Leonard
,
drawing
his
pistols
,
advanced
towards
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
my
prisoner
,
my
lord
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
stern
voice
,
"
and
shall
not
depart
with
life
,
unless
you
pledge
your
word
never
to
come
hither
again
on
the
same
errand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Betrayed
!
"
cried
the
earl
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
"
Resistance
is
in
vain
,
my
lord
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
better
armed
than
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Will
nothing
bribe
you
to
silence
,
fellow
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
you
a
thousand
pounds
,
if
you
will
hold
your
tongue
,
and
conduct
me
to
my
mistress
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
scarcely
tell
what
stays
my
hand
,
"
returned
Leonard
,
in
a
furious
tone
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
hold
no
further
conversation
with
you
.
<EOS>
Amabel
is
present
,
and
will
give
you
your
final
dismissal
herself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
receive
it
from
her
own
lips
,
"
replied
the
earl
,
"
I
will
instantly
retire
--
but
not
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Amabel
,
"
said
Leonard
in
a
low
tone
to
her
,
"
you
hear
what
is
said
.
<EOS>
Fulfil
your
promise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
so
,
"
cried
a
voice
,
which
she
instantly
recognised
,
in
her
ear--"I
am
near
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hesitate
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
apprentice
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
said
Amabel
,
in
a
faint
voice
,
"
I
must
pray
you
to
retire
,
your
efforts
are
in
vain
.
<EOS>
I
will
never
fly
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
will
not
suffice
,
"
whispered
Leonard
;
"
you
must
tell
him
you
no
longer
love
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
,
"
pursued
Amabel
;
"
you
who
present
yourself
as
Lord
Rochester
,
I
entertain
no
affection
for
you
,
and
never
wish
to
behold
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Admirable
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Gregory
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
could
be
better
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
cried
the
supposed
earl
,
"
since
I
no
longer
hold
a
place
in
your
affections
,
it
would
be
idle
to
pursue
the
matter
further
.
<EOS>
Heaven
be
praised
,
there
are
other
damsels
quite
as
beautiful
,
though
not
so
cruel
.
<EOS>
Farewell
for
ever
,
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
he
mounted
the
ladder
,
and
,
followed
by
his
companion
,
disappeared
on
the
other
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
gone
,
"
said
Leonard
,
"
and
I
hope
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Now
let
us
return
to
the
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
coming
,
"
rejoined
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
him
go
,
"
whispered
Gregory
.
<EOS>
"
The
ladder
is
still
upon
the
wall
;
we
will
climb
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
the
apprentice
moved
towards
the
house
,
he
tried
to
drag
her
in
that
direction
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
cannot
--
will
not
fly
thus
,
"
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Leonard
,
suddenly
turning
.
 
<EOS>
"
Further
disguise
is
useless
,
"
replied
the
supposed
Gregory
Swindlehurst
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
Earl
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
The
other
was
a
counterfeit
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
Leonard
,
rushing
towards
them
,
and
placing
a
pistol
against
the
breast
of
his
mistress
?
"
<EOS>
Have
I
been
duped
?
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
yet
too
late
to
retrieve
my
error
.
<EOS>
Move
a
foot
further
<EOS>
,
my
lord,--and
do
you
,
Amabel
,
attempt
to
fly
with
him
,
and
I
fire
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
mean
this
?
"
cried
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Raise
your
hand
against
the
woman
you
love
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Against
the
woman
who
forgets
her
duty
,
and
the
libertine
who
tempts
her
,
the
arm
that
is
raised
is
that
of
justice
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
Stir
another
footstep
,
and
I
fire
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
his
arms
were
suddenly
seized
by
a
powerful
grasp
from
behind
,
and
,
striking
the
pistols
from
his
hold
,
the
earl
snatched
up
Amabel
in
his
arms
,
and
,
mounting
the
ladder
,
made
good
his
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
A
long
and
desperate
struggle
took
place
between
Leonard
and
his
assailant
,
who
was
no
other
than
Pillichody
,
in
his
assumed
character
of
Bernard
Boutefeu
.
<EOS>
But
notwithstanding
the
superior
strength
of
the
bully
,
and
the
advantage
he
had
taken
of
the
apprentice
,
he
was
worsted
in
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
Leonard
had
no
sooner
extricated
himself
,
than
,
drawing
his
sword
,
he
would
have
passed
it
through
Pillichody
's
body
,
if
the
latter
had
not
stayed
his
hand
by
offering
to
tell
him
where
he
would
find
his
mistress
,
<EOS>
provided
his
life
were
spared
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
has
the
earl
taken
her
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Leonard
,
scarcely
able
to
articulate
from
excess
of
passion
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
meant
to
take
her
to
Saint
<EOS>
Paul's,--to
the
vaults
below
the
cathedral
,
to
avoid
pursuit
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
you
will
find
her
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
there
instantly
and
search
,
"
cried
Leonard
,
rushing
up
the
ladder
.
  
<EOS>
V.
 
<EOS>
THE
BLIND
PIPER
AND
HIS
DAUGHTER
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
knowing
how
he
got
there
,
Leonard
Holt
found
himself
at
the
great
northern
entrance
of
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
Burning
with
fury
,
he
knocked
at
the
door
;
but
no
answer
being
returned
to
the
summons
,
though
he
repeated
it
still
more
loudly
,
he
shook
the
heavy
latch
with
such
violence
as
to
rouse
the
sullen
echoes
of
the
aisles
.
<EOS>
Driven
almost
to
desperation
,
he
retired
a
few
paces
,
and
surveyed
the
walls
of
the
vast
structure
,
in
the
hope
of
descrying
some
point
by
which
he
might
obtain
an
entrance
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
bright
moonlight
night
,
and
the
reverend
pile
looked
so
beautiful
,
that
,
under
any
other
frame
of
mind
,
Leonard
must
,
have
been
struck
with
admiration
.
<EOS>
The
ravages
of
time
could
not
now
be
discerned
,
and
the
architectural
incongruities
which
,
seen
in
the
broad
glare
of
day
,
would
have
offended
the
eye
of
taste
,
were
lost
in
the
general
grand
effect
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
ran
the
magnificent
pointed
windows
of
the
choir
,
divided
by
massive
buttresses,--the
latter
ornamented
with
crocketed
pinnacles
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
,
the
building
had
been
new
-
faced
,
and
its
original
character
,
in
a
great
measure
,
destroyed
by
the
tasteless
manner
in
which
the
repairs
had
been
executed
.
<EOS>
On
this
side
,
the
lower
windows
were
round
-
headed
and
separated
by
broad
pilasters
,
while
above
them
ran
a
range
of
small
circular
windows
.
<EOS>
At
the
western
angle
was
seen
one
of
the
towers
(
since
imitated
by
Wren
)
,
which
flanked
this
side
of
the
fane
,
together
with
a
part
of
the
portico
erected
,
about
twenty
-
five
years
previously
,
by
Inigo
Jones
,
and
which
,
though
beautiful
in
itself
,
was
totally
out
of
character
with
the
edifice
,
and
,
in
fact
,
a
blemish
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Insensible
alike
to
the
beauties
or
defects
of
the
majestic
building
,
and
regarding
it
only
as
the
prison
of
his
mistress
,
Leonard
Holt
scanned
it
carefully
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
But
his
scrutiny
was
attended
with
no
favourable
result
.
 
<EOS>
Before
resorting
to
force
to
obtain
admission
,
he
determined
to
make
the
complete
circuit
of
the
structure
,
and
with
this
view
he
shaped
his
course
towards
the
east
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
two
small
doors
on
the
left
of
the
northern
transept
,
but
both
were
fastened
,
and
the
low
pointed
windows
beneath
the
choir
,
lighting
the
subterranean
church
of
Saint
Faith
's
,
were
all
barred
.
<EOS>
Running
on
,
he
presently
came
to
a
flight
of
stone
steps
at
the
north
-
east
corner
of
the
choir
,
leading
to
a
portal
opening
upon
a
small
chapel
dedicated
to
Saint
George
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
secured
like
the
others
,
and
,
thinking
it
vain
to
waste
time
in
trying
to
force
it
,
he
pursued
his
course
.
 
<EOS>
Skirting
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
fane
--
then
the
most
beautiful
part
of
the
structure
,
from
its
magnificent
rose
window
--
he
speeded
past
the
low
windows
which
opened
on
this
side
,
as
on
the
other
upon
Saint
Faith
's
,
and
did
not
pause
till
he
came
to
the
great
southern
portal
,
the
pillars
and
arch
of
which
differed
but
slightly
in
character
from
those
of
the
northern
entrance
.
 
<EOS>
Here
he
knocked
as
before
,
and
was
answered
,
as
on
the
former
occasion
,
by
sullen
echoes
from
within
.
<EOS>
When
these
sounds
died
away
,
he
placed
his
ear
to
the
huge
key
-
hole
in
the
wicket
,
but
could
not
even
catch
the
fall
of
a
footstep
.
<EOS>
Neither
could
he
perceive
any
light
,
except
that
afforded
by
the
moonbeams
,
which
flooded
the
transept
with
radiance
.
 
<EOS>
Again
hurrying
on
,
he
passed
the
cloister
-
walls
surrounding
the
Convocation
House
;
tried
another
door
between
that
building
and
the
church
of
Saint
Gregory
,
a
small
fane
attached
to
the
larger
structure
;
and
failing
in
opening
it
,
turned
the
corner
and
approached
the
portico,--the
principal
entrance
to
the
cathedral
being
then
,
as
now
,
on
the
west
.
 
<EOS>
Erected
,
as
before
mentioned
,
from
the
designs
of
the
celebrated
Inigo
Jones
,
this
magnificent
colonnade
was
completed
about
1640
,
at
which
time
preparations
were
made
for
repairing
the
cathedral
throughout
,
and
for
strengthening
the
tower
,
for
enabling
it
to
support
a
new
spire
.
<EOS>
But
this
design
,
owing
to
the
disorganised
state
of
affairs
,
was
never
carried
into
execution
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
time
of
the
Commonwealth
,
while
the
interior
of
the
sacred
fabric
underwent
every
sort
of
desecration
and
mutilation,--while
stones
were
torn
from
the
pavement
,
and
monumental
brasses
from
tombs,--while
carved
stalls
were
burnt
,
and
statues
plucked
from
their
niches,--a
similar
fate
attended
the
portico
.
<EOS>
Shops
were
built
beneath
it
,
and
the
sculptures
ornamenting
its
majestic
balustrade
were
thrown
down
.
 
<EOS>
Amongst
other
obstructions
,
it
appears
that
there
was
a
"
high
house
in
the
north
angle
,
which
hindered
the
masons
from
repairing
that
part
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
The
marble
door
-
cases
,
the
capitals
,
cornices
,
and
pillars
were
so
much
injured
by
the
fires
made
against
them
,
that
it
required
months
to
put
them
in
order
.
<EOS>
At
the
Restoration
,
Sir
John
Denham
,
the
poet
,
was
appointed
surveyor
-
general
of
the
works
,
and
continued
to
hold
the
office
at
the
period
of
this
history
.
 
<EOS>
As
Leonard
drew
near
the
portico
,
he
perceived
,
to
his
surprise
,
that
a
large
concourse
of
people
was
collected
in
the
area
in
front
of
it
;
and
,
rushing
forward
,
he
found
the
assemblage
listening
to
the
denunciations
of
Solomon
Eagle
,
who
was
standing
in
the
midst
of
them
with
his
brazier
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
The
enthusiast
appeared
more
than
usually
excited
.
<EOS>
He
was
tossing
aloft
his
arms
in
a
wild
and
frenzied
manner
,
and
seemed
to
be
directing
his
menaces
against
the
cathedral
itself
.
 
<EOS>
Hoping
to
obtain
assistance
from
the
crowd
,
Leonard
resolved
to
await
a
fitting
period
to
address
them
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
joined
them
,
and
listened
to
the
discourse
of
the
enthusiast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
latter
,
in
a
voice
of
thunder
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
a
vision
last
night
and
will
relate
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
During
my
brief
slumbers
,
I
thought
I
was
standing
on
this
very
spot
,
and
gazing
as
now
upon
yon
mighty
structure
.
<EOS>
On
a
sudden
the
day
became
overcast
,
and
ere
long
it
grew
pitchy
dark
.
<EOS>
Then
was
heard
a
noise
of
rushing
wings
in
the
air
,
and
I
could
just
discern
many
strange
figures
hovering
above
the
tower
,
uttering
doleful
cries
and
lamentations
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
these
figures
disappeared
,
and
gave
place
to
,
or
,
it
may
be
,
were
chased
away
by
,
others
of
more
hideous
appearance
.
<EOS>
The
latter
brought
lighted
brands
which
they
hurled
against
the
sacred
fabric
,
and
,
in
an
instant
,
flames
burst
forth
from
it
on
all
sides
.
<EOS>
My
brethren
,
it
was
a
fearful
,
yet
a
glorious
sight
to
see
that
vast
pile
wrapped
in
the
devouring
element
!
<EOS>
The
flames
were
so
vivid
--
so
intense
--
that
I
could
not
bear
to
look
upon
them
,
and
I
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
.
<EOS>
On
raising
my
eyes
again
the
flames
were
extinguished
,
but
the
building
was
utterly
in
ruins
--
its
columns
cracked
--
its
tower
hurled
from
its
place
--
its
ponderous
roof
laid
low
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
mournful
spectacle
,
and
a
terrible
proof
of
the
Divine
wrath
and
vengeance
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
brethren
,
the
temple
of
the
Lord
has
been
profaned
,
and
it
will
be
razed
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
the
scene
of
abomination
and
impiety
,
and
must
be
purified
by
fire
.
<EOS>
Theft
,
murder
,
sacrilege
,
and
every
other
crime
have
been
committed
within
its
walls
,
and
its
destruction
will
follow
.
<EOS>
The
ministers
of
Heaven
's
vengeance
are
even
now
hovering
above
it
.
<EOS>
Repent
,
therefore
,
ye
who
listen
to
me
,
and
repent
speedily
;
for
sudden
death
,
plague
,
fire
,
and
famine
,
are
at
hand
.
<EOS>
As
the
prophet
Amos
saith
,
'
The
Lord
will
send
a
fire
,
the
Lord
will
commission
a
fire
,
the
Lord
will
kindle
a
fire
;
'
and
the
fire
so
commissioned
and
so
kindled
shall
consume
you
and
your
city
;
nor
shall
one
stone
of
those
walls
be
left
standing
on
another
.
<EOS>
Repent
,
or
burn
,
for
he
cometh
to
judge
the
earth
.
<EOS>
Repent
,
or
burn
<EOS>
,
I
say
!
"
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
concluded
,
Leonard
Holt
ran
up
the
steps
of
the
portico
,
and
in
a
loud
voice
claimed
the
attention
of
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
"
Solomon
Eagle
is
right
,
"
he
cried
;
"
the
vengeance
of
Heaven
will
descend
upon
this
fabric
,
since
it
continues
to
be
the
scene
of
so
much
wickedness
.
<EOS>
Even
now
it
forms
the
retreat
of
a
profligate
nobleman
,
who
has
this
night
forcibly
carried
off
the
daughter
of
a
citizen
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
nobleman
?
<EOS>
"
cried
a
bystander
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Earl
of
Rochester
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
robbed
Stephen
Bloundel
,
the
grocer
of
Wood
-
street
,
of
his
daughter
,
and
has
concealed
her
,
to
avoid
pursuit
,
in
the
vaults
of
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
Mr.
Bloundel
<EOS>
well
,
"
rejoined
the
man
who
had
made
the
inquiry
,
and
whom
Leonard
recognised
as
a
hosier
named
Lamplugh
,
"
and
I
know
the
person
who
addresses
us
.
<EOS>
It
is
his
apprentice
.
<EOS>
We
must
restore
the
damsel
to
her
father
,
friends
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Agreed
!
"
cried
several
voices
.
 
<EOS>
"
Knock
at
the
door
,
"
cried
a
man
,
whose
occupation
of
a
smith
was
proclaimed
by
his
leathern
apron
,
brawny
chest
,
and
smoke
-
begrimed
visage
,
as
well
as
by
the
heavy
hammer
which
he
bore
upon
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
is
not
instantly
opened
,
we
will
break
it
down
.
<EOS>
I
have
an
implement
here
which
will
soon
do
the
business
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
rush
was
then
made
to
the
portal
,
which
rang
with
the
heavy
blows
dealt
against
it
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
passing
,
Solomon
Eagle
,
whose
excitement
was
increased
by
the
tumult
,
planted
himself
in
the
centre
of
the
colonnade
,
and
vociferated--"I
speak
in
the
words
of
the
prophet
Ezekiel:--'Thou
hast
<EOS>
defiled
thy
sanctuaries
by
the
multitude
of
thine
iniquities
,
by
the
iniquity
of
thy
traffic
.
<EOS>
Therefore
will
I
bring
forth
a
fire
from
the
midst
of
thee
,
and
will
bring
thee
to
ashes
upon
the
earth
,
in
the
sight
of
all
them
that
behold
thee
!
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
crowd
continued
to
batter
the
door
until
they
were
checked
by
Lamplugh
,
who
declared
he
heard
some
one
approaching
,
and
the
next
moment
the
voice
of
one
of
the
vergers
inquired
in
trembling
tones
,
who
they
were
,
and
what
they
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
matter
who
we
are
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
"
we
demand
admittance
to
search
for
a
young
female
who
has
been
taken
from
her
home
by
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
and
is
now
concealed
within
the
vaults
of
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
admittance
is
refused
us
,
we
will
soon
let
ourselves
in
,
"
vociferated
Lamplugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
that
we
will
,
"
added
the
smith
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
mistaken
,
friends
,
"
returned
the
verger
,
timorously
.
<EOS>
"
The
Earl
of
Rochester
is
not
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
take
your
word
for
it
,
"
rejoined
the
smith
.
<EOS>
"
This
will
show
you
we
are
not
to
be
trifled
with
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
raised
his
hammer
,
and
struck
such
a
tremendous
blow
against
the
door
,
that
the
bolts
started
in
their
sockets
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
hold
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
verger
;
"
sooner
than
violence
shall
be
committed
,
I
will
risk
your
admission
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
unfastened
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Keep
together
,
"
shouted
the
smith
,
stretching
out
his
arms
to
oppose
the
progress
of
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
"
Keep
together
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
keep
together
,
"
added
Lamplugh
,
seconding
his
efforts
.
 
<EOS>
"
Conduct
us
to
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
and
no
harm
shall
befall
you
,
"
cried
Leonard
,
seizing
the
verger
by
the
collar
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
about
him
,
"
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
not
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
false
!
<EOS>
you
are
bribed
to
silence
,
"
rejoined
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
search
till
we
find
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Search
where
you
please
,
"
rejoined
the
verger
;
"
and
if
you
_
do
_
find
him
,
do
what
you
please
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
afraid
of
that
,
friend
,
"
replied
the
smith
;
"
we
will
hang
you
and
the
earl
to
the
same
pillar
.
"
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
crowd
had
pushed
aside
the
opposition
offered
by
the
smith
and
Lamplugh
.
<EOS>
Solomon
Eagle
darted
along
the
nave
with
lightning
swiftness
,
and
,
mounting
the
steps
leading
to
the
choir
,
disappeared
from
view
.
<EOS>
Some
few
persons
followed
him
,
while
others
took
their
course
along
the
aisles
.
<EOS>
But
the
majority
kept
near
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
Snatching
the
lamp
from
the
grasp
of
the
verger
,
Leonard
Holt
ran
on
with
his
companions
till
they
came
to
the
beautiful
chapel
built
by
Thomas
Kempe
,
bishop
of
London
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
open
,
and
the
apprentice
,
holding
the
light
forward
,
perceived
there
were
persons
inside
.
<EOS>
He
was
about
to
enter
the
chapel
,
when
a
small
spaniel
rushed
forth
,
and
,
barking
furiously
,
held
him
in
check
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Alarmed
by
the
noise
,
an
old
man
in
a
tattered
garb
,
and
a
young
female
,
who
were
slumbering
on
benches
in
the
chapel
,
immediately
started
to
their
feet
,
and
advanced
towards
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
mistaken
,
"
said
Lamplugh
;
"
this
is
only
Mike
Macascree
,
the
blind
piper
and
his
daughter
Nizza
.
<EOS>
I
know
them
well
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
was
about
to
proceed
with
his
search
,
but
a
slight
circumstance
detained
him
for
a
few
minutes
,
during
which
time
he
had
sufficient
leisure
to
note
the
extraordinary
personal
attractions
of
Nizza
Macascree
.
 
<EOS>
In
age
she
appeared
about
seventeen
,
and
differed
in
the
character
of
her
beauty
,
as
well
as
in
the
natural
gracefulness
of
her
carriage
and
demeanour
,
from
all
the
persons
he
had
seen
in
her
humble
sphere
of
life
.
<EOS>
Her
features
were
small
,
and
of
the
utmost
delicacy
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
charmingly
-
formed
nose
--
slightly
_
retroussé_--a
small
mouth
,
garnished
with
pearl
-
like
teeth
,
and
lips
as
fresh
and
ruddy
as
the
dew
-
steeped
rose
.
<EOS>
Her
skin
was
as
dark
as
a
gipsy
's
,
but
clear
and
transparent
,
and
far
more
attractive
than
the
fairest
complexion
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
luminous
as
the
stars
,
and
black
as
midnight
;
while
her
raven
tresses
,
gathered
beneath
a
spotted
kerchief
tied
round
her
head
,
escaped
in
many
a
wanton
curl
down
her
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
was
slight
,
but
exquisitely
proportioned
;
and
she
had
the
smallest
foot
and
ankle
that
ever
fell
to
the
lot
of
woman
.
<EOS>
Her
attire
was
far
from
unbecoming
,
though
of
the
coarsest
material
;
and
her
fairy
feet
were
set
off
by
the
daintiest
shoes
and
hose
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
singular
and
captivating
creature
that
attracted
the
apprentice
's
attention
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
,
Mike
Macascree
,
was
upwards
of
sixty
,
but
still
in
the
full
vigour
of
life
,
with
features
which
,
though
not
ill
-
looking
,
bore
no
particular
resemblance
to
those
of
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
good
-
humoured
,
jovial
countenance
,
the
mirthful
expression
of
which
even
his
sightless
orbs
could
not
destroy
.
<EOS>
Long
white
locks
descended
upon
his
shoulders
,
and
a
patriarchal
beard
adorned
his
chin
.
<EOS>
He
was
wrapped
in
a
loose
grey
gown
,
patched
with
different
coloured
cloths
,
and
supported
himself
with
a
staff
.
<EOS>
His
pipe
was
suspended
from
his
neck
by
a
green
worsted
cord
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lie
down
,
Bell
<EOS>
,
"
he
cried
to
his
dog
;
"
what
are
you
barking
at
thus
?
<EOS>
Lie
down
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Something
is
the
matter
,
father
,
"
replied
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
The
church
is
full
of
people
.
"
 
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
the
piper
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
sorry
to
disturb
you
,
"
said
Leonard
;
"
but
we
are
in
search
of
a
nobleman
who
has
run
away
with
a
citizen
's
daughter
,
and
conveyed
her
to
the
cathedral
,
<EOS>
and
we
thought
they
might
have
taken
refuge
in
this
chapel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
one
is
here
except
myself
and
daughter
,
"
replied
the
piper
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
allowed
this
lodging
by
Mr.
Quatremain
,
the
minor
canon
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
All
dogs
are
ordered
to
be
destroyed
by
the
Lord
Mayor
,
"
cried
the
smith
,
seizing
Bell
by
the
neck
.
<EOS>
"
This
noisy
animal
must
be
silenced
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
!
do
not
hurt
her
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
loves
poor
Bell
almost
as
well
as
he
loves
me
.
<EOS>
She
is
necessary
to
his
existence
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
--
will
not
destroy
her
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
I
?
<EOS>
"
replied
the
smith
,
gruffly
;
"
we
'll
see
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
we
are
not
afraid
of
contagion
,
are
we
,
father
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Nizza
,
appealing
to
the
piper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
in
the
least
,
"
replied
Mike
,
"
and
we
will
take
care
the
poor
beast
touches
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
Do
not
harm
her
,
sir
--
for
pity
's
sake
,
do
not
.
<EOS>
I
should
miss
her
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
Lord
Mayor
's
commands
must
be
obeyed
,
"
rejoined
the
smith
,
brutally
.
 
<EOS>
As
if
conscious
of
the
fate
awaiting
her
,
poor
Bell
struggled
hard
to
get
free
,
and
uttered
a
piteous
yell
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
going
to
kill
the
dog
?
"
<EOS>
interposed
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
anything
to
say
to
the
contrary
?
"
rejoined
the
smith
,
in
a
tone
calculated
,
as
he
thought
,
to
put
an
end
to
further
interference
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
this
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
"
that
I
will
not
allow
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
won't
--
eh
?
"
returned
the
smith
,
derisively
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
,
"
so
put
her
down
and
come
along
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Go
your
own
way
,
"
replied
the
smith
,
"
and
leave
me
to
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
answered
by
snatching
Bell
suddenly
from
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
Thus
liberated
,
the
terrified
animal
instantly
flew
to
her
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
this
the
return
I
get
for
assisting
you
?
"
cried
the
smith
,
savagely
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
bewitched
by
a
pair
of
black
eyes
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
repent
your
folly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
forget
your
kindness
,
"
replied
Nizza
,
clasping
Bell
to
her
bosom
,
and
looking
gratefully
at
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
You
say
you
are
in
search
of
a
citizen
's
daughter
and
a
nobleman
.
<EOS>
About
half
an
hour
ago
,
or
scarcely
so
much
,
I
was
awakened
by
the
opening
of
the
door
of
the
southern
transept
,
and
peeping
out
<EOS>
,
I
saw
three
persons
--
a
young
man
in
the
dress
of
a
watchman
,
but
evidently
disguised
,
and
a
very
beautiful
young
woman
,
conducted
by
Judith
Malmayns
,
bearing
a
lantern,--pass
through
the
doorway
leading
to
Saint
Faith
's
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
they
are
the
very
persons
you
are
in
search
of
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
,
"
returned
Leonard
;
"
and
you
have
repaid
me
a
hundredfold
for
the
slight
service
I
have
rendered
you
by
the
information
.
<EOS>
We
will
instantly
repair
to
the
vaults
.
<EOS>
Come
along
.
"
 
<EOS>
Accompanied
by
the
whole
of
the
assemblage
,
except
the
smith
,
who
skulked
off
in
the
opposite
direction
,
he
passed
through
the
low
doorway
on
the
right
of
the
choir
,
and
descended
to
Saint
Faith
's
.
<EOS>
The
subterranean
church
was
buried
in
profound
darkness
,
and
apparently
wholly
untenanted
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
charnel
,
they
crossed
it
,
and
tried
the
door
of
the
vault
formerly
occupied
by
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
It
was
fastened
,
but
Leonard
knocking
violently
against
it
,
it
was
soon
opened
by
Judith
Malmayns
,
who
appeared
much
surprised
,
and
not
a
little
alarmed
,
at
the
sight
of
so
many
persons
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
alone
,
and
her
companion
was
Chowles
.
<EOS>
He
was
seated
at
a
table
,
on
which
stood
a
flask
of
brandy
and
a
couple
of
glasses
,
and
seemed
a
good
deal
confused
at
being
caught
in
such
a
situation
,
though
he
endeavoured
to
cover
his
embarrassment
by
an
air
of
effrontery
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
Earl
of
<EOS>
Rochester?--where
is
Amabel
?
"
demanded
Leonard
Holt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
about
either
of
them
,
"
replied
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
put
these
questions
to
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
you
admitted
them
to
the
cathedral
,
"
cried
the
apprentice
,
furiously
,
"
and
because
you
have
concealed
them
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
not
instantly
guide
me
to
their
retreat
,
I
will
make
you
a
terrible
example
to
all
such
evil
-
doers
in
future
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
think
to
frighten
me
by
your
violence
,
you
are
mistaken
,
"
returned
Judith
,
boldly
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Chowles
has
been
here
more
than
two
hours
--
ask
him
whether
he
has
seen
any
one
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
Chowles
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
Amabel
--
no
Earl
of
Rochester
here
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
dreaming
,
young
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
piper
's
daughter
affirmed
the
contrary
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
She
said
she
saw
this
woman
admit
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
lies
,
"
replied
Judith
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
But
suddenly
altering
her
tone
,
she
continued
,
"
If
I
_
had
_
admitted
them
,
you
would
find
them
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
looked
round
uneasily
.
<EOS>
He
was
but
half
convinced
,
and
yet
he
scarcely
knew
what
to
think
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
doubt
what
I
say
to
you
,
"
continued
Judith
,
"
I
will
take
you
to
every
chamber
in
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
You
will
then
be
satisfied
that
I
speak
the
truth
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
have
this
mob
with
me
.
<EOS>
Your
companions
must
remain
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
stop
with
me
and
make
yourselves
comfortable
,
"
cried
Chowles
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
so
much
used
to
these
places
as
I
am
,
I
prefer
a
snug
crypt
,
like
this
,
to
the
best
room
in
a
tavern
--
ha
!
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
Attended
by
Judith
,
Leonard
Holt
searched
every
corner
of
the
subterranean
church
,
except
the
vestry
,
the
door
of
which
was
locked
,
and
the
key
removed
;
but
without
success
.
<EOS>
They
then
ascended
to
the
upper
structure
,
and
visited
the
choir
,
the
transepts
,
and
the
nave
,
but
with
no
better
result
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
still
think
they
are
here
,
"
said
Judith
,
"
we
will
mount
to
the
summit
of
the
tower
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
quit
the
cathedral
without
them
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
on
,
then
,
"
returned
Judith
.
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
opened
the
door
in
the
wall
on
the
left
of
the
choir
,
and
,
ascending
a
winding
stone
staircase
to
a
considerable
height
,
arrived
at
a
small
cell
contrived
within
the
thickness
of
the
wall
,
and
desired
Leonard
to
search
it
.
<EOS>
The
apprentice
unsuspectingly
obeyed
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
scarcely
set
foot
inside
when
the
door
was
locked
behind
him
,
and
he
was
made
aware
of
the
treachery
practised
upon
him
by
a
peal
of
mocking
laughter
from
his
conductress
.

<EOS>
OLD
LONDON
FROM
OLD
SAINT
PAUL'S.
 
After
repeated
,
but
ineffectual
efforts
to
burst
open
the
door
,
Leonard
gave
up
the
attempt
in
despair
,
and
endeavoured
to
make
his
situation
known
by
loud
outcries
.
<EOS>
But
his
shouts
,
if
heard
,
were
unheeded
,
and
he
was
soon
compelled
from
exhaustion
to
desist
.
<EOS>
Judith
having
carried
away
the
lantern
,
he
was
left
in
total
darkness
;
but
on
searching
the
cell
,
which
was
about
four
feet
wide
and
six
deep
,
he
discovered
a
narrow
grated
loophole
.
<EOS>
By
dint
of
great
exertion
,
and
with
the
help
of
his
sword
,
which
snapped
in
twain
as
he
used
it
,
he
managed
to
force
off
one
of
the
rusty
bars
,
and
to
squeeze
himself
through
the
aperture
.
<EOS>
All
his
labour
,
however
,
was
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
The
loophole
opened
on
the
south
side
of
the
tower
,
near
one
of
the
large
buttresses
,
which
projected
several
yards
beyond
it
on
the
left
,
and
was
more
than
twenty
feet
above
the
roof
;
so
that
it
would
be
certain
destruction
to
drop
from
so
great
a
height
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
was
overcast
,
and
the
moon
hidden
behind
thick
clouds
.
<EOS>
Still
,
there
was
light
enough
to
enable
him
to
discern
the
perilous
position
in
which
he
stood
.
<EOS>
After
gazing
below
for
some
time
,
Leonard
was
about
to
return
to
the
cell
,
when
,
casting
his
eyes
upwards
,
he
thought
he
perceived
the
end
of
a
rope
about
a
foot
above
his
head
,
dangling
from
the
upper
part
of
the
structure
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
was
this
discovery
made
,
than
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
possibly
liberate
himself
by
this
unlooked
for
aid
;
and
,
regardless
of
the
risk
he
ran
,
he
sprang
upwards
and
caught
hold
of
the
rope
.
<EOS>
It
was
firmly
fastened
above
,
and
sustained
his
weight
well
.
 
<EOS>
Possessed
of
great
bodily
strength
and
activity
,
and
nerved
by
desperation
,
Leonard
Holt
placed
his
feet
against
the
buttress
,
and
impelled
himself
towards
one
of
the
tall
pointed
windows
lighting
the
interior
of
the
tower
;
but
though
he
reached
the
point
at
which
he
aimed
,
the
sway
of
the
rope
dragged
him
back
before
he
could
obtain
a
secure
grasp
of
the
stone
shaft
;
and
,
after
another
ineffectual
effort
,
fearful
of
exhausting
his
strength
,
he
abandoned
the
attempt
,
and
began
to
climb
up
the
rope
with
his
hands
and
knees
.
<EOS>
Aided
by
the
inequalities
of
the
roughened
walls
,
he
soon
gained
a
range
of
small
Saxon
arches
ornamenting
the
tower
immediately
beneath
the
belfry
,
and
succeeded
in
planting
his
right
foot
on
the
moulding
of
one
of
them
;
he
instantly
steadied
himself
,
and
with
little
further
effort
clambered
through
an
open
window
.
 
<EOS>
His
first
act
on
reaching
the
belfry
was
to
drop
on
his
knees
,
and
return
thanks
to
Heaven
for
his
deliverance
.
<EOS>
He
then
looked
about
for
an
outlet
;
but
though
a
winding
staircase
existed
in
each
of
the
four
angles
of
the
tower
,
all
the
doors
,
to
his
infinite
disappointment
,
were
fastened
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
,
therefore
,
a
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
Determined
,
however
,
not
to
yield
to
despair
,
he
continued
his
search
,
and
finding
a
small
door
opening
upon
a
staircase
communicating
with
the
summit
of
the
tower
,
he
unfastened
it
(
for
the
bolt
was
on
his
own
side
)
,
and
hurried
up
the
steps
.
<EOS>
Passing
through
another
door
bolted
like
the
first
within
side
,
he
issued
upon
the
roof
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
on
the
highest
part
of
the
cathedral
,
and
farther
from
his
hopes
than
ever
;
and
so
agonizing
were
his
feelings
,
that
he
almost
felt
tempted
to
fling
himself
headlong
downwards
.
<EOS>
Beneath
him
lay
the
body
of
the
mighty
fabric
,
its
vast
roof
,
its
crocketed
pinnacles
,
its
buttresses
and
battlements
scarcely
discernible
through
the
gloom
,
but
looking
like
some
monstrous
engine
devised
to
torture
him
.
 
<EOS>
Wearied
with
gazing
at
it
,
and
convinced
of
the
futility
of
any
further
attempt
at
descent
,
Leonard
Holt
returned
to
the
belfry
,
and
,
throwing
himself
on
the
boarded
floor
,
sought
some
repose
.
<EOS>
The
fatigue
he
had
undergone
was
so
great
,
that
,
notwithstanding
his
anxiety
,
he
soon
dropped
asleep
,
and
did
not
awake
for
several
hours
.
<EOS>
On
opening
his
eyes
,
it
was
just
getting
light
,
and
shaking
himself
,
he
again
prepared
for
action
.
<EOS>
All
the
events
of
the
night
rushed
upon
his
mind
,
and
he
thought
with
unutterable
anguish
of
Amabel
's
situation
.
<EOS>
Glancing
round
the
room
,
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
give
the
alarm
by
ringing
the
enormous
bells
near
him
;
but
though
he
set
them
slightly
in
motion
,
he
could
not
agitate
the
immense
clappers
sufficiently
to
produce
any
sound
.
 
<EOS>
Resolved
,
however
,
to
free
himself
at
any
hazard
,
he
once
more
repaired
to
the
summit
of
the
tower
,
and
leaning
over
the
balustrade
,
gazed
below
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
sublime
spectacle
,
and
,
in
spite
of
his
distress
,
filled
him
with
admiration
and
astonishment
.
<EOS>
He
had
stationed
himself
on
the
south
side
of
the
tower
,
and
immediately
beneath
him
lay
the
broad
roof
of
the
transept
,
stretching
out
to
a
distance
of
nearly
two
hundred
feet
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
,
surrounded
by
a
double
row
of
cloisters
,
remarkable
for
the
beauty
of
their
architecture
,
stood
the
convocation
,
or
chapter
-
house
.
<EOS>
The
exquisite
building
was
octagonal
in
form
,
and
supported
by
large
buttresses
,
ornamented
on
each
gradation
by
crocketed
pinnacles
.
<EOS>
Each
side
,
moreover
,
had
a
tall
pointed
window
,
filled
with
stained
glass
,
and
was
richly
adorned
with
trefoils
and
cinquefoils
.
<EOS>
Further
on
,
on
the
same
side
,
was
the
small
low
church
dedicated
to
Saint
Gregory
,
overtopped
by
the
south
-
western
tower
of
the
mightier
parent
fane
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
,
however
,
the
cathedral
itself
,
but
the
magnificent
view
it
commanded
,
that
chiefly
attracted
the
apprentice
's
attention
.
<EOS>
From
the
elevated
point
on
which
he
stood
,
his
eye
ranged
over
a
vast
tract
of
country
bounded
by
the
Surrey
hills
,
and
at
last
settled
upon
the
river
,
which
in
some
parts
was
obscured
by
a
light
haze
,
and
in
others
tinged
with
the
ruddy
beams
of
the
newly
-
risen
sun
.
<EOS>
Its
surface
was
spotted
,
even
at
this
early
hour
,
with
craft
,
while
innumerable
vessels
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
were
moored
,
to
its
banks
.
<EOS>
On
.
<EOS>
the
left
,
he
noted
the
tall
houses
covering
London
Bridge
;
and
on
the
right
,
traced
the
sweeping
course
of
the
stream
as
it
flowed
from
Westminster
.
<EOS>
On
this
hand
,
on
the
opposite
bank
,
lay
the
flat
marshes
of
Lambeth
;
while
nearer
stood
the
old
bull
-
baiting
and
bear
-
baiting
establishments
,
the
flags
above
which
could
be
discerned
above
the
tops
of
the
surrounding
habitations
.
<EOS>
A
little
to
the
left
was
the
borough
of
Southwark
,
even
then
a
large
and
populous
district
--
<EOS>
the
two
most
prominent
features
in
the
scene
being
Winchester
House
,
and
Saint
Saviour
's
old
and
beautiful
church
.
 
<EOS>
Filled
with
wonder
at
what
he
saw
,
Leonard
looked
towards
the
east
,
and
here
an
extraordinary
prospect
met
his
gaze
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
the
city
of
London
was
spread
out
like
a
map
before
him
,
and
presented
a
dense
mass
of
ancient
houses
,
with
twisted
chimneys
,
gables
,
and
picturesque
roofs
--
here
and
there
overtopped
by
a
hall
,
a
college
,
an
hospital
,
or
some
other
lofty
structure
.
<EOS>
This
vast
collection
of
buildings
was
girded
in
by
grey
and
mouldering
walls
,
approached
by
seven
gates
,
and
intersected
by
innumerable
narrow
streets
.
<EOS>
The
spires
and
towers
of
the
churches
shot
up
into
the
clear
morning
air
--
for
,
except
in
a
few
quarters
,
no
smoke
yet
issued
from
the
chimneys
.
<EOS>
On
this
side
,
the
view
of
the
city
was
terminated
by
the
fortifications
and
keep
of
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
Little
did
the
apprentice
think
,
when
he
looked
at
the
magnificent
scene
before
him
,
and
marvelled
at
the
countless
buildings
he
beheld
,
that
,
ere
fifteen
months
had
elapsed
,
the
whole
mass
,
together
with
the
mighty
fabric
on
which
he
stood
,
would
be
swept
away
by
a
tremendous
conflagration
.
<EOS>
Unable
to
foresee
this
direful
event
,
and
lamenting
only
that
so
fair
<EOS>
a
city
should
be
a
prey
to
an
exterminating
pestilence
,
he
turned
towards
the
north
,
and
suffered
his
gaze
to
wander
over
Finsbury
-
fields
,
and
the
hilly
ground
beyond
them
--
over
Smithfield
and
Clerkenwell
,
and
the
beautiful
open
country
adjoining
Gray's
-
inn
-
lane
.
 
<EOS>
So
smiling
and
beautiful
<EOS>
did
these
districts
appear
,
that
ha
could
scarcely
fancy
they
were
the
chief
haunts
of
the
horrible
distemper
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
blind
himself
to
the
fact
that
in
Finsbury
-
fields
,
as
well
as
in
the
open
country
to
the
north
of
Holborn
,
plague
-
pits
had
been
digged
and
pest
-
houses
erected
;
and
this
consideration
threw
such
a
gloom
over
the
prospect
,
that
,
in
order
to
dispel
the
effect
,
he
changed
the
scene
by
looking
towards
the
west
.
<EOS>
Here
his
view
embraced
all
the
proudest
mansions
of
the
capital
,
and
tracing
the
Strand
to
Charing
Cross
,
long
since
robbed
of
the
beautiful
structure
from
which
it
derived
its
name
,
and
noticing
its
numerous
noble
habitations
,
his
eye
finally
rested
upon
Whitehall
:
and
he
heaved
a
sigh
as
he
thought
that
the
palace
of
the
sovereign
was
infected
by
as
foul
a
moral
taint
as
the
hideous
disease
that
ravaged
the
dwellings
of
his
subjects
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
time
that
Leonard
Holt
gazed
upon
the
capital
,
its
picturesque
beauties
were
nearly
at
their
close
.
<EOS>
In
a
little
more
than
a
year
and
a
quarter
afterwards
,
the
greater
part
of
the
old
city
was
consumed
by
fire
;
and
though
it
was
rebuilt
,
and
in
many
respects
improved
,
its
original
and
picturesque
character
was
entirely
destroyed
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
scarcely
possible
to
conceive
a
finer
view
than
can
be
gained
from
the
dome
of
the
modern
cathedral
at
sunrise
on
a
May
morning
,
when
the
prospect
is
not
dimmed
by
the
smoke
of
a
hundred
thousand
chimneys
--
when
the
river
is
just
beginning
to
stir
with
its
numerous
craft
,
or
when
they
are
sleeping
on
its
glistening
bosom
--
when
every
individual
house
,
court
,
church
,
square
,
or
theatre
,
can
be
discerned
--
when
the
eye
can
range
over
the
whole
city
on
each
side
,
and
calculate
its
vast
extent
.
<EOS>
It
seems
scarcely
possible
,
we
say
,
to
suppose
at
any
previous
time
it
could
be
more
striking
;
and
yet
,
at
the
period
under
consideration
,
it
was
incomparably
more
so
.
<EOS>
Then
,
every
house
was
picturesque
,
and
every
street
a
collection
of
picturesque
objects
.
<EOS>
Then
,
that
which
was
objectionable
in
itself
,
and
contributed
to
the
insalubrity
of
the
city
,
namely
,
the
extreme
narrowness
of
the
streets
,
and
overhanging
stories
of
the
houses
,
was
the
main
source
of
their
beauty
.
<EOS>
Then
,
the
huge
projecting
signs
with
their
fantastical
iron
-
work
--
the
conduits
--
the
crosses
(
where
crosses
remained)--the
maypoles
--
all
were
picturesque
;
and
as
superior
to
what
can
now
be
seen
,
as
the
attire
of
Charles
the
Second
's
age
is
to
the
ugly
and
disfiguring
costume
of
our
own
day
.
 
<EOS>
Satiated
with
this
glorious
prospect
,
Leonard
began
to
recur
to
his
own
situation
,
and
carefully
scrutinizing
every
available
point
on
the
side
of
the
Tower
,
he
thought
it
possible
to
effect
his
descent
by
clambering
down
the
gradations
of
one
of
the
buttresses
.
<EOS>
Still
,
as
this
experiment
would
be
attended
with
the
utmost
danger
,
while
,
even
if
he
reached
the
roof
,
he
would
yet
be
far
from
his
object
,
he
resolved
to
defer
it
for
a
short
time
,
in
the
hope
that
ere
long
seine
of
the
bell
-
ringers
,
or
other
persons
connected
with
the
cathedral
,
might
come
thither
and
set
him
free
.
 
<EOS>
While
thus
communing
with
himself
,
he
heard
a
door
open
below
;
and
hurrying
down
the
stairs
at
the
sound
,
he
beheld
,
to
his
great
surprise
and
joy
,
the
piper
's
daughter
,
Nizza
Macascree
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
searched
for
you
everywhere
,
"
she
cried
,
"
and
began
to
think
some
ill
had
befallen
you
.
<EOS>
I
overheard
<EOS>
Judith
Malmayns
say
she
had
shut
you
up
in
a
cell
in
the
upper
part
of
the
tower
.
<EOS>
How
did
you
escape
thence
?
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
hastily
explained
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
I
should
never
forget
the
service
you
rendered
me
in
preserving
the
life
of
poor
Bell
,
"
pursued
Nizza
,
"
and
what
I
have
done
will
prove
I
am
not
unmindful
of
my
promise
<EOS>
I
saw
you
search
the
cathedral
last
night
with
Judith
,
and
noticed
that
she
returned
from
the
tower
unaccompanied
by
you
.
<EOS>
At
first
I
supposed
you
might
have
left
the
cathedral
without
my
observing
you
,
and
I
was
further
confirmed
in
the
idea
by
what
I
subsequently
heard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
hear
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
followed
Judith
to
the
vaults
of
Saint
Faith
's
,
"
replied
Nizza
,
"
and
heard
her
inform
your
companions
that
you
had
found
the
grocer
's
daughter
,
and
had
taken
her
away
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
this
false
statement
imposed
upon
them
?
"
cried
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
did
,
"
replied
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
They
were
by
this
time
more
than
half
intoxicated
by
the
brandy
given
them
by
Chowles
,
the
coffin
-
maker
,
and
they
departed
in
high
dudgeon
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
wonder
!
"
exclaimed
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
had
scarcely
been
gone
many
minutes
,
"
pursued
Nizza
,
"
when
,
having
stationed
myself
behind
one
of
the
massive
pillars
in
the
north
aisle
of
Saint
Faith's
--
for
I
suspected
something
was
wrong
--
I
observed
Judith
and
Chowles
steal
across
the
nave
,
and
proceed
towards
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
The
former
tapped
at
the
door
,
and
they
were
instantly
admitted
by
Mr.
Quatremain
,
the
minor
canon
.
<EOS>
Hastening
to
the
door
,
which
was
left
slightly
ajar
,
I
perceived
two
young
gallants
,
whom
I
heard
addressed
as
the
Earl
of
Rochester
and
Sir
George
Etherege
,
and
a
young
female
,
who
I
could
not
doubt
was
Amabel
.
<EOS>
The
earl
and
his
companion
laughed
heartily
at
the
trick
Judith
had
played
you
,
and
which
the
latter
detailed
to
them
;
but
Amabel
took
no
part
in
their
merriment
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
looked
very
grave
,
and
even
wept
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wept
,
did
she
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Leonard
,
in
a
voice
of
much
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
,
there
is
hope
for
her
yet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
appear
greatly
interested
in
her
,
"
observed
Nizza
,
pausing
,
in
her
narration
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
love
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
ask
it
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Leonard
,
passionately
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
advise
you
to
think
no
more
of
her
,
and
to
fix
your
heart
elsewhere
,
"
returned
Nizza
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
not
what
it
is
to
love
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
,
"
or
you
would
not
offer
such
a
counsel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
,
"
replied
Nizza
;
"
but
I
am
sorry
you
have
bestowed
your
heart
upon
one
who
so
little
appreciates
the
boon
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
feeling
she
had
said
too
much
,
she
blushed
deeply
,
and
cast
down
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Unconscious
of
her
confusion
,
and
entirely
engrossed
by
the
thought
of
his
mistress
,
Leonard
urged
her
to
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
what
has
become
of
Amabel
--
where
I
shall
find
her
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
her
soon
enough
,
"
replied
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
not
left
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
But
hear
me
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
On
learning
you
were
made
a
prisoner
,
I
ran
to
the
door
leading
to
the
tower
,
but
found
that
Judith
had
locked
it
,
and
removed
the
key
.
<EOS>
Not
daring
to
give
the
alarm
--
for
I
had
gathered
from
what
was
said
that
the
three
vergers
were
in
the
earl
's
pay
--
I
determined
to
await
a
favourable
opportunity
to
release
you
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
I
returned
to
the
vestry
door
,
and
again
played
the
eaves
-
dropper
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
another
person
,
who
was
addressed
as
Major
Pillichody
,
and
who
,
it
appeared
,
had
been
employed
in
the
abduction
,
had
joined
the
party
.
<EOS>
He
informed
the
earl
that
Mr.
Bloundel
was
in
the
greatest
distress
at
his
daughter
's
disappearance
,
and
advised
him
to
lose
no
time
in
conveying
her
to
some
secure
retreat
.
<EOS>
These
tidings
troubled
Amabel
exceedingly
,
and
the
earl
endeavoured
to
pacify
her
by
promising
to
espouse
her
at
daybreak
,
and
,
as
soon
as
the
ceremony
was
over
,
to
introduce
her
in
the
character
of
his
countess
to
her
parents
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Villain
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Leonard
;
"
but
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
little
more
to
tell
,
"
replied
Nizza
,
"
except
that
she
consented
to
the
proposal
,
<EOS>
provided
she
was
allowed
to
remain
till
six
o'clock
,
the
hour
appointed
for
the
marriage
,
with
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bad
as
that
alternative
is
,
it
is
better
than
the
other
,
"
observed
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
But
how
did
you
procure
the
key
of
the
winding
staircase
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fortunately
observed
where
Judith
had
placed
it
,
"
replied
Nizza
,
"
and
when
she
departed
to
the
crypt
near
the
charnel
,
with
Amabel
,
I
possessed
myself
of
it
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
I
was
unable
to
use
it
,
because
the
Earl
of
Rochester
and
Sir
George
Etherege
kept
pacing
to
and
fro
in
front
of
the
door
,
and
their
discourse
convinced
me
that
the
marriage
was
meant
to
be
a
feigned
one
,
for
Sir
George
strove
to
dissuade
his
friend
from
the
step
he
was
about
to
take
;
but
the
other
only
laughed
at
his
scruples
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
retired
,
which
is
not
more
than
half
an
hour
ago
,
I
unlocked
the
door
,
and
hurried
up
the
winding
stairs
.
<EOS>
I
searched
every
chamber
,
and
began
to
think
you
were
gone
,
or
that
Judith
's
statement
was
false
.
<EOS>
But
I
resolved
to
continue
my
search
until
I
was
fully
satisfied
on
this
point
,
and
accordingly
ascended
to
the
belfry
.
<EOS>
You
are
aware
of
the
result
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
rendered
me
a
most
important
service
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
"
and
I
hope
hereafter
to
prove
my
gratitude
.
<EOS>
But
let
us
now
descend
to
the
choir
,
where
I
will
conceal
myself
till
Amabel
appears
.
<EOS>
This
marriage
must
be
prevented
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Before
quitting
the
belfry
,
Leonard
chanced
to
cast
his
eyes
on
a
stout
staff
left
there
,
either
by
one
of
the
bell
-
ringers
or
some
chance
visitant
,
and
seizing
it
as
an
unlooked
-
for
prize
,
he
ran
down
the
steps
,
followed
by
the
piper
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
On
opening
the
lowest
door
,
he
glanced
towards
the
choir
,
and
there
before
the
high
altar
stood
Quatremain
in
his
surplice
,
with
the
earl
and
Amabel
,
attended
by
Etherege
and
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
The
ceremony
had
just
commenced
.
<EOS>
Not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
.
<EOS>
Grasping
his
staff
,
the
apprentice
darted
along
the
nave
,
and
,
rushing
up
to
the
pair
,
exclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
,
"
Hold
!
<EOS>
I
forbid
this
marriage
.
<EOS>
It
must
not
take
place
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Back
,
sirrah
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Etherege
,
drawing
his
sword
,
and
opposing
the
approach
of
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
authority
to
interrupt
it
.
<EOS>
Proceed
,
Mr.
Quatremain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Forbear
!
"
cried
a
voice
of
thunder
near
them
--
and
all
turning
at
the
cry
,
they
beheld
Solomon
Eagle
,
with
his
brazier
on
his
head
,
issue
from
behind
the
stalls
.
<EOS>
"
Forbear
!
"
cried
the
enthusiast
,
placing
himself
between
the
earl
and
Amabel
,
both
of
whom
recoiled
at
his
approach
.
<EOS>
"
Heaven
's
altar
must
not
be
profaned
with
these
mockeries
!
<EOS>
And
you
,
Thomas
Quatremain
,
who
have
taken
part
in
this
unrighteous
transaction
,
make
clean
your
breast
,
and
purge
yourself
quickly
of
your
sins
,
for
your
hours
are
numbered
.
<EOS>
I
read
in
your
livid
looks
and
red
and
burning
eyeballs
that
you
are
smitten
by
the
pestilence
.

PAUL
'S
WALK
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
now
be
necessary
to
ascertain
what
took
place
at
the
grocer
's
habitation
subsequently
to
Amabel
's
abduction
.
<EOS>
Leonard
Holt
having
departed
,
Pillichody
was
preparing
to
make
good
his
retreat
,
when
he
was
prevented
by
Blaize
,
who
,
hearing
a
noise
in
the
yard
,
peeped
cautiously
out
at
the
back
-
door
,
and
inquired
who
was
there
?
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
Mr.
Bloundel
?
"
rejoined
Pillichody
,
bethinking
him
of
a
plan
to
turn
the
tables
upon
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
am
his
porter
,
"
replied
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
,
Blaize
!
"
replied
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thunder
and
lightning
!
<EOS>
do
n't
you
remember
Bernard
Boutefeu
,
the
watchman
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
remember
any
watchman
of
that
name
,
and
I
can
not
discern
your
features
,
"
rejoined
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
your
voice
sounds
familiar
to
me
.
<EOS>
What
are
you
doing
there
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
trying
to
prevent
Leonard
Holt
from
carrying
off
your
master
's
daughter
,
the
fair
Mistress
Amabel
,
"
answered
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
has
accomplished
his
villanous
purpose
in
spite
of
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
devil
he
has
!
"
cried
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
Here
is
a
pretty
piece
of
news
for
my
master
.
<EOS>
But
how
did
you
discover
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Chancing
to
pass
along
the
entry
on
the
other
side
of
that
wall
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
,
"
returned
Pillichody
,
"
I
perceived
a
rope
-
ladder
fastened
to
it
,
and
wishing
to
ascertain
what
was
the
matter
,
I
mounted
it
,
and
had
scarcely
got
over
into
the
yard
,
when
I
saw
two
persons
advancing
.
<EOS>
I
concealed
myself
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
wall
,
and
they
did
not
notice
me
;
but
I
gathered
from
their
discourse
who
they
were
and
what
was
their
design
.
<EOS>
I
allowed
Amabel
to
ascend
,
but
just
as
the
apprentice
was
following
,
I
laid
hold
of
the
skirt
of
his
doublet
,
and
,
pulling
him
back
,
desired
him
to
come
with
me
to
his
master
.
<EOS>
He
answered
by
drawing
his
sword
,
and
would
have
stabbed
me
,
but
I
closed
with
him
,
and
should
have
secured
him
if
my
foot
had
not
slipped
.
<EOS>
While
I
was
on
the
ground
,
he
dealt
me
a
severe
blow
,
and
ran
after
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Just
like
him
,
"
replied
Blaize
.
"
<EOS>
He
took
the
same
cowardly
advantage
of
me
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
punishment
will
be
too
severe
for
him
,
"
rejoined
Pillichody
,
"
and
I
hope
your
master
will
make
a
terrible
example
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
fortunate
I
was
not
gone
to
bed
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Blaize
,
"
I
had
just
taken
a
couple
of
rufuses
,
and
was
about
to
put
on
my
nightcap
,
when
,
hearing
a
noise
without
,
and
being
ever
on
the
alert
to
defend
my
master
's
property
,
even
at
the
hazard
of
my
life
,
I
stepped
forth
and
found
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
bear
testimony
to
your
vigilance
and
courage
,
"
returned
Pillichody
;
"
but
you
had
better
go
and
alarm
your
master
,
I
will
wait
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Instantly
I
-
instantly
!
"
cried
Blaize
,
rushing
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
way
to
Mr.
Bloundel
's
chamber
,
he
met
Patience
,
and
told
her
what
he
had
heard
.
<EOS>
She
was
inclined
to
put
a
very
different
construction
on
the
story
;
but
as
she
bore
the
apprentice
<EOS>
no
particular
good
-
will
,
she
determined
to
keep
her
opinion
to
herself
,
and
let
affairs
take
their
course
.
<EOS>
The
grocer
was
soon
aroused
,
and
scarcely
able
to
credit
the
porter
's
intelligence
,
and
yet
fearing
something
must
be
wrong
,
he
hastily
attired
himself
,
and
proceeded
to
Amabel
's
room
.
<EOS>
It
was
empty
,
and
it
was
evident
from
the
state
in
which
everything
was
left
,
that
she
had
never
retired
to
rest
.
<EOS>
Confounded
by
the
sight
,
Bloundel
then
hurried
downstairs
in
search
of
the
apprentice
,
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
Mrs.
Bloundel
had
joined
him
,
and
on
hearing
Blaize
's
story
,
utterly
scouted
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Leonard
could
have
no
motive
for
acting
thus
.
<EOS>
He
had
our
consent
to
the
union
,
and
the
sole
obstacle
to
it
was
Amabel
herself
.
<EOS>
Is
it
likely
he
would
run
away
with
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
do
not
know
,
"
replied
Patience
,
"
but
he
was
desperately
in
love
,
that
's
certain
;
and
when
people
are
in
love
,
I
am
told
they
do
very
strange
and
unaccountable
things
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
may
have
carried
her
off
against
her
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
,
"
rejoined
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
heard
a
scream
,
and
should
have
called
out
at
the
moment
,
but
a
rufus
stuck
in
my
throat
and
prevented
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
person
who
says
he
intercepted
them
?
"
asked
Bloundel
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
yard
,
"
answered
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bid
him
come
hither
,
"
rejoined
his
master
.
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
I
will
go
to
him
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
the
whole
party
,
including
old
Josyna
and
Stephen
--
the
two
boys
and
little
Christiana
not
having
been
disturbed
--
proceeded
to
the
yard
,
where
they
found
Pillichody
in
his
watchman
's
dress
,
who
related
his
story
more
circumstantially
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
of
it
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Bloundel
;
"
and
I
will
stake
my
life
<EOS>
it
is
one
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
's
tricks
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Were
I
assured
that
such
was
the
case
,
"
said
the
grocer
,
in
a
stern
whisper
to
his
wife
,
"
I
would
stir
no
further
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
My
threat
to
Amabel
was
not
an
idle
one
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
may
be
mistaken
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
almost
at
her
wit
's
end
with
anxiety
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
mind
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
Judge
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
Oh
dear
!
<EOS>
what
_
will
_
become
of
her
?
"
<EOS>
she
mentally
ejaculated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lanterns
and
links
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
to
impeach
my
veracity
,
good
mistress
?
<EOS>
I
am
an
old
soldier
,
and
as
tenacious
of
my
honour
as
your
husband
is
of
his
credit
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
blustering
will
not
serve
your
turn
,
fellow
,
"
observed
the
grocer
,
seizing
him
by
the
collar
.
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
suspect
my
wife
is
in
the
right
,
and
will
at
all
events
detain
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Detain
me
!
<EOS>
on
what
ground
?
"
asked
Pillichody
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
an
accomplice
in
my
daughter
's
abduction
,
"
replied
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
Blaize
--
Stephen
,
hold
him
while
I
call
the
watch
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
most
mysterious
affair
,
but
I
will
soon
get
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
By
the
grocer
's
directions
,
Pillichody
,
who
very
quietly
entered
the
house
,
and
surrendered
his
halberd
to
Blaize
,
was
taken
to
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
Bloundel
then
set
forth
,
leaving
Stephen
on
guard
at
the
yard
door
,
while
his
wife
remained
in
the
shop
,
awaiting
his
return
.
 
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
kitchen
with
the
prisoner
,
Blaize
besought
his
mother
,
who
,
as
well
as
Patience
,
had
accompanied
him
thither
,
to
fetch
a
bottle
of
sack
.
<EOS>
While
she
went
for
the
wine
,
and
the
porter
was
stalking
to
and
fro
before
the
door
with
the
halberd
on
his
shoulder
,
Patience
whispered
to
Pillichody
,
"
I
know
who
you
are
.
<EOS>
You
came
here
last
night
with
the
Earl
of
Rochester
in
the
disguise
of
a
quack
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Pillichody
,
placing
his
finger
on
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
going
to
betray
you
,
"
returned
Patience
,
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
sure
to
be
found
out
,
and
had
better
beat
a
retreat
before
Mr.
Bloundel
returns
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
lose
a
moment
,
"
replied
Pillichody
,
starting
to
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Blaize
,
suddenly
halting
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
got
up
to
see
whether
the
wine
was
coming
,
"
replied
Pillichody
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
here
it
is
,
"
replied
Blaize
,
as
his
mother
reappeared
;
"
and
now
you
shall
have
a
glass
of
such
sack
as
you
never
yet
tasted
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
pouring
out
a
bumper
,
he
offered
it
to
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
The
latter
took
the
glass
;
but
his
hand
shook
so
violently
that
he
could
not
raise
it
to
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
ails
you
,
friend
?
"
inquired
Blaize
,
uneasily
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
replied
Pillichody
;
"
but
I
feel
extremely
unwell
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
looks
to
me
as
if
he
had
got
the
plague
,
"
observed
Patience
,
to
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
plague
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
latter
,
letting
fall
the
glass
,
which
shivered
to
pieces
on
the
stone
floor
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
have
touched
him
.
<EOS>
Where
is
the
vinegar
-
bottle
?
<EOS>
I
must
sprinkle
myself
directly
,
and
rub
myself
from
head
to
foot
with
oil
of
hartshorn
and
spirits
of
sulphur
.
<EOS>
Mother
!
<EOS>
dear
mother
!
<EOS>
you
have
taken
away
my
medicine
-
chest
.
<EOS>
If
you
love
me
,
go
and
fetch
me
a
little
conserve
of
Roman
wormwood
and
mithridate
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
them
in
two
small
jars
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
do
,
"
cried
Patience
;
"
or
he
may
die
with
fright
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Moved
by
their
joint
entreaties
,
old
Josyna
again
departed
;
and
her
back
was
no
sooner
turned
,
than
Patience
said
in
an
undertone
to
Pillichody,--"Now
is
your
time
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
.
"
 
<EOS>
Instantly
taking
the
hint
,
the
other
uttered
a
loud
cry
,
and
springing
up
,
caught
at
Blaize
,
who
instantly
dropped
the
halberd
,
and
fled
into
one
corner
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Pillichody
then
hurried
upstairs
,
while
Blaize
shouted
after
him
,
"
Do
n't
touch
him
,
Master
Stephen
.
<EOS>
He
has
got
the
plague
!
<EOS>
he
has
got
the
plague
!
"
 
<EOS>
Alarmed
by
this
outcry
,
Stephen
suffered
Pillichody
to
pass
;
and
the
latter
,
darting
across
the
yard
,
mounted
the
rope
-
ladder
,
and
quickly
disappeared
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
afterwards
,
Bloundel
returned
with
the
watch
,
and
was
greatly
enraged
when
he
found
that
the
prisoner
had
got
off
.
<EOS>
No
longer
doubting
that
he
had
been
robbed
of
his
daughter
by
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
abandon
her
to
her
fate
,
and
his
conflicting
feelings
occasioned
him
a
night
of
indescribable
anxiety
.
<EOS>
The
party
of
watch
whom
he
had
summoned
searched
the
street
for
him
,
and
endeavoured
to
trace
out
the
fugitives,--but
without
success
;
and
they
returned
before
daybreak
to
report
their
failure
.
 
<EOS>
About
six
o'clock
,
Mr.
Bloundel
,
unable
to
restrain
himself
longer
,
sallied
forth
with
Blaize
in
search
of
his
daughter
and
Leonard
.
<EOS>
Uncertain
where
to
bend
his
steps
,
he
trusted
to
chance
to
direct
him
,
resolved
,
if
he
were
unsuccessful
,
to
lay
a
petition
for
redress
before
the
throne
.
<EOS>
Proceeding
along
Cheapside
,
he
entered
Paternoster
-
row
,
and
traversed
it
till
he
came
to
Paul
's
Alley,--a
narrow
passage
leading
to
the
north
-
west
corner
of
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
Prompted
by
an
unaccountable
impulse
,
he
no
sooner
caught
sight
of
the
reverend
structure
,
than
he
hastened
,
towards
it
,
and
knocked
against
the
great
northern
door
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
,
however
,
precede
him
,
and
return
to
the
party
at
the
altar
.
<EOS>
The
awful
warning
of
Solomon
Eagle
so
alarmed
Quatremain
,
that
he
let
fall
his
prayer
-
book
,
and
after
gazing
vacantly
round
for
a
few
moments
,
staggered
to
one
of
the
stalls
,
where
,
feeling
a
burning
pain
in
his
breast
,
he
tore
open
his
doublet
,
and
found
that
the
enthusiast
had
spoken
the
truth
,
and
that
he
was
really
attacked
by
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
As
to
Amabel
,
on
hearing
the
terrible
denunciation
,
she
uttered
a
loud
cry
,
and
would
have
fallen
to
the
ground
but
for
the
timely
assistance
of
the
apprentice
,
who
caught
her
with
one
arm
,
while
with
the
other
he
defended
himself
against
the
earl
and
his
companions
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
spite
of
his
resistance
,
they
would
have
soon
compelled
him
to
relinquish
his
charge
,
if
Solomon
Eagle
,
who
had
hitherto
contented
himself
with
gazing
sternly
on
what
was
passing
,
had
not
interfered
;
and
,
rushing
towards
the
combatants
,
seized
Rochester
and
Etherege
,
and
hurled
them
backwards
with
almost
supernatural
force
.
<EOS>
When
they
arose
,
and
menaced
him
with
their
swords
,
he
laughed
loudly
and
contemptuously
,
crying
,
"
Advance
,
if
ye
dare
!
<EOS>
and
try
your
strength
against
one
armed
by
Heaven
,
and
ye
will
find
how
far
it
will
avail
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
Leonard
Holt
heard
a
musical
voice
behind
him
,
and
turning
,
beheld
Nizza
Macascree
.
<EOS>
She
beckoned
him
to
follow
her
;
and
,
raising
Amabel
in
his
arms
,
he
ran
towards
the
door
leading
to
Saint
Faith
's
,
through
which
his
conductress
passed
.
<EOS>
All
this
was
the
work
of
a
moment
,
and
when
Rochester
and
Etherege
,
who
rushed
after
him
,
tried
the
door
,
they
found
it
fastened
withinside
.
 
<EOS>
Just
then
,
a
loud
knocking
was
heard
at
the
northern
entrance
of
the
cathedral
,
and
a
verger
answering
the
summons
,
Mr.
Bloundel
and
Blaize
were
admitted
.
<EOS>
On
beholding
the
newcomers
,
Rochester
and
his
companions
were
filled
with
confusion
.
<EOS>
Equally
astonished
at
the
recounter
,
the
grocer
grasped
his
staff
,
and
rushing
up
to
the
earl
,
demanded
,
in
a
voice
that
made
the
other
,
despite
his
natural
audacity
,
<EOS>
quail--"Where
is
my
child
,
my
lord
?
<EOS>
What
have
you
done
with
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
about
her
,
"
replied
Rochester
,
with
affected
carelessness.--"Yes
<EOS>
,
I
am
wrong
,
"
he
added
,
as
if
recollecting
himself
;
"
lam
told
she
has
run
away
with
your
apprentice
.
"
 
<EOS>
Pillichody
,
who
had
changed
his
attire
since
his
escape
from
the
grocer
's
dwelling
,
thought
he
might
now
venture
to
address
him
without
fear
of
discovery
,
and
,
setting
his
arms
a
-
kimbo
,
and
assuming
a
swaggering
demeanour
,
strutted
forward
and
said
,
"
Your
daughter
has
just
been
wedded
to
Leonard
Holt
,
Mr.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
false
,
"
cried
Bloundel
,
"
as
false
as
the
character
you
just
personated
,
for
I
recognise
you
as
the
knave
who
recently
appeared
before
me
as
a
watchman
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
pledge
you
my
word
as
a
nobleman
,
"
interposed
Rochester
,
"
that
your
daughter
has
just
descended
to
Saint
Faith
's
with
your
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
corroborate
his
lordship
's
assertion
,
"
said
Etherege
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
,
"
added
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
the
holy
apostle
to
whom
this
fane
is
dedicated
!
it
is
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
convince
you
that
we
speak
the
truth
,
we
will
go
with
you
and
assist
you
to
search
,
"
said
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
Attaching
little
credit
to
what
he
heard
,
and
yet
unwilling
to
lose
a
chance
of
recovering
his
daughter
,
the
grocer
rushed
to
the
door
indicated
by
his
informant
,
but
found
it
fastened
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
go
to
the
main
entrance
,
"
said
one
of
the
vergers
;
"
I
have
the
keys
with
me
,
and
will
admit
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
keep
guard
here
till
you
return
,
"
said
another
verger
 
Accompanied
by
Rochester
and
Etherege
,
Bloundel
then
proceeded
to
the
chief
door
of
the
subterranean
church
.
<EOS>
It
was
situated
at
the
south
of
the
cathedral
,
between
two
of
the
larger
buttresses
,
and
at
the
foot
of
a
flight
of
stone
steps
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
it
,
the
verger
produced
his
keys
,
but
they
were
of
no
avail
,
for
the
door
was
barred
withinside
.
<EOS>
After
many
fruitless
attempts
to
obtain
admission
,
they
were
fain
to
give
up
the
attempt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
we
can
not
get
in
,
no
one
shall
get
out
,
"
observed
the
verger
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
only
key
that
opens
this
door
is
in
my
possession
,
so
we
have
them
safe
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
party
then
returned
to
the
cathedral
,
where
they
found
Blaize
,
Pillichody
,
and
the
two
other
vergers
keeping
watch
at
the
door
near
the
choir
.
<EOS>
No
one
had
come
forth
.
 
<EOS>
Rochester
then
walked
apart
with
his
companions
,
while
Bloundel
,
feeling
secure
so
long
as
he
kept
the
earl
in
view
,
folded
his
arms
upon
his
breast
,
and
determined
to
await
the
result
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
doors
being
opened
,
a
great
crowd
was
soon
collected
within
the
sacred
structure
.
<EOS>
Saint
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
as
is
well
known
,
was
formerly
the
great
mart
for
booksellers
,
who
have
not
,
even
in
later
times
,
deserted
the
neighbourhood
,
but
still
congregate
in
Paternoster
-
row
,
Ave
-
Maria
-
lane
,
and
the
adjoining
streets
.
<EOS>
At
the
period
of
this
history
they
did
not
confine
themselves
to
the
precincts
of
the
cathedral
,
but
,
as
has
been
previously
intimated
,
fixed
their
shops
against
the
massive
pillars
of
its
nave
.
<EOS>
Besides
booksellers
,
there
were
seamstresses
,
tobacco
-
merchants
,
vendors
of
fruit
and
provisions
,
and
Jews
--
all
of
whom
had
stalls
within
the
cathedral
,
and
who
were
now
making
preparations
for
the
business
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
numbers
who
came
for
recreation
and
amusement
made
their
appearance
,
and
before
ten
o'clock
,
Paul
's
Walk
,
as
the
nave
was
termed
,
was
thronged
,
by
apprentices
,
rufflers
,
porters
,
water
-
carriers
,
higglers
,
with
baskets
on
their
heads
,
or
under
their
arms
,
fish
-
wives
,
quack
-
doctors
,
cutpurses
,
bonarobas
,
merchants
,
lawyers
,
and
serving
-
men
,
who
came
to
be
hired
,
and
who
stationed
themselves
near
an
oaken
block
attached
to
one
of
the
pillars
,
and
which
was
denominated
,
from
the
use
it
was
put
to
,
the
"
serving
-
man
's
log
.
<EOS>
"
Some
of
the
crowd
were
smoking
,
some
laughing
,
<EOS>
others
gathering
round
a
ballad
-
singer
,
who
was
chanting
one
of
Rochester
's
own
licentious
ditties
;
some
were
buying
quack
medicines
and
remedies
for
the
plague
,
the
virtues
of
which
the
vendor
loudly
extolled
;
while
others
were
paying
court
to
the
dames
,
many
of
whom
were
masked
.
<EOS>
Everything
seemed
to
be
going
forward
within
this
sacred
place
,
except
devotion
.
<EOS>
Here
,
a
man
,
mounted
on
the
carved
marble
of
a
monument
,
bellowed
forth
the
news
of
the
Dutch
war
,
while
another
,
not
far
from
him
,
on
a
bench
,
announced
in
lugubrious
accents
the
number
of
those
who
had
died
on
the
previous
day
of
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
There
,
at
the
very
font
,
was
a
usurer
paying
over
a
sum
of
money
to
a
gallant
--
it
was
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
--
who
was
sealing
a
bond
for
thrice
the
amount
of
the
loan
.
<EOS>
There
,
a
party
of
choristers
,
attended
by
a
troop
of
boys
,
were
pursuing
another
gallant
,
who
had
ventured
into
the
cathedral
booted
and
spurred
,
and
were
demanding
"
spur
-
money
"
of
him
--
an
exaction
which
they
claimed
as
part
of
their
perquisites
.
 
<EOS>
An
admirable
picture
of
this
curious
scene
has
been
given
by
Bishop
Earle
,
in
his
_
Microcosmographia
_
,
published
in
1629
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Paul
's
Walk
,
"
he
writes
,
"
is
the
land
's
epitome
,
or
you
may
call
it
the
lesser
isle
of
Great
Britain
.
<EOS>
It
is
more
than
this
--
it
is
the
whole
world
's
map
,
which
you
may
here
discern
in
its
perfectest
motion
,
jostling
and
turning
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
heap
of
stones
and
men
,
with
a
vast
confusion
of
languages
;
and
were
the
steeple
not
sanctified
,
nothing
could
be
liker
Babel
.
<EOS>
The
noise
in
it
is
like
that
of
bees
,
a
strange
humming
,
or
buzzing
,
mixed
of
walking
,
tongues
,
and
feet
:
it
is
a
kind
of
still
roar
,
or
loud
whisper
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
great
exchange
of
all
discourse
,
and
no
business
whatsoever
,
but
is
here
stirring
and
afoot
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
synod
of
all
parts
politic
,
jointed
and
laid
together
in
most
serious
posture
,
and
they
are
not
half
so
busy
at
the
Parliament
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
market
of
young
lecturers
,
whom
you
may
cheapen
here
at
all
rates
and
sizes
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
general
mint
of
all
famous
lies
,
which
are
here
,
like
the
legends
of
Popery
,
first
coined
and
stamped
in
the
church
.
<EOS>
All
inventions
are
emptied
here
,
and
not
a
few
pockets
.
<EOS>
The
best
sign
of
the
Temple
in
it
is
that
it
is
the
thieves
'
sanctuary
,
who
rob
more
safely
in
a
crowd
than
a
wilderness
,
while
every
pillar
is
a
bush
to
hide
them
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
other
expense
of
the
day
,
after
plays
and
taverns
;
and
men
have
still
some
oaths
to
swear
here
.
<EOS>
The
visitants
are
all
men
without
exceptions
;
but
the
principal
inhabitants
are
stale
knights
and
captains
out
of
service
,
men
of
long
rapiers
and
short
purses
,
who
after
all
turn
merchants
here
,
and
traffic
for
news
.
<EOS>
Some
make
it
a
preface
to
their
dinner
,
and
travel
for
an
appetite
;
but
thirstier
men
make
it
their
ordinary
,
and
board
here
very
cheap
.
<EOS>
Of
all
such
places
it
is
least
haunted
by
hobgoblins
,
for
if
a
ghost
would
walk
here
,
he
could
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
Decker
,
moreover
,
terms
Paul
's
Walk
,
or
the
"
Mediterranean
Isle
,
"
in
his
"
Gull
's
Hornbook"--"the
only
gallery
wherein
the
pictures
of
all
your
true
fashionate
and
complimental
gulls
are
,
and
ought
to
be
,
hung
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
giving
circumstantial
directions
for
the
manner
of
entering
the
walk
,
he
proceeds
thus
:
<EOS>
"
Bend
your
course
directly
in
the
middle
line
that
the
whole
body
of
the
church
may
appear
to
be
yours
,
where
in
view
of
all
,
you
may
publish
your
suit
in
what
manner
you
affect
most
,
either
with
the
slide
of
your
cloak
from
the
one
shoulder
or
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
recommends
the
gull
,
after
four
or
five
turns
in
the
nave
,
to
betake
himself
to
some
of
the
semsters
'
shops
the
new
tobacco
office
,
or
the
booksellers
'
stalls
,
"
where
,
if
you
can
not
read
,
exercise
your
smoke
,
and
inquire
who
has
written
against
the
divine
weed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
,
or
something
like
it
,
was
Paul
's
Walk
at
the
period
of
this
history
.
 
<EOS>
The
grocer
,
who
had
not
quitted
his
post
,
remained
a
silent
and
sorrowful
spectator
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Despite
his
anxiety
,
he
could
not
help
moralizing
upon
it
,
and
it
furnished
him
with
abundant
food
for
reflection
.
<EOS>
As
to
Rochester
and
his
companions
,
they
mingled
with
the
crowd
--
though
the
earl
kept
a
wary
eye
on
the
door
--
chatted
with
the
prettiest
damsels
--
listened
to
the
newsmongers
,
and
broke
their
fast
at
the
stall
of
a
vendor
of
provisions
,
who
supplied
them
with
tolerable
viands
,
and
a
bottle
of
excellent
Rhenish
.
<EOS>
Blaize
was
soon
drawn
away
by
one
of
the
quacks
,
and
,
in
spite
of
his
master
's
angry
looks
,
he
could
not
help
purchasing
one
of
the
infallible
antidotes
offered
for
sale
by
the
charlatan
.
<EOS>
Parravicin
had
no
sooner
finished
his
business
with
the
usurer
than
he
strolled
along
the
nave
,
and
was
equally
surprised
and
delighted
at
meeting
with
his
friends
,
who
briefly
explained
to
him
why
they
were
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
how
do
you
expect
the
adventure
to
terminate
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Parravicin
,
laughing
heartily
at
the
recital
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
knows
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
are
you
doing
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
came
partly
to
replenish
my
purse
,
for
I
have
had
a
run
of
ill
luck
of
late
,
"
replied
the
knight
;
"
and
partly
to
see
a
most
beautiful
creature
,
whom
I
accidentally
discovered
here
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
new
beauty
!
"
cried
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
she
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Before
I
tell
you
,
you
must
engage
not
to
interfere
with
me
,
"
replied
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
marked
her
for
my
own
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Agreed
,
"
replied
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
her
name
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
the
daughter
of
a
blind
piper
,
who
haunts
the
cathedral
,
"
replied
Parravicin
,
"
and
her
name
is
Nizza
Macascree
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
charming
?
<EOS>
But
you
shall
see
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
not
go
too
far
from
the
door
of
Saint
Faith
's
,
"
rejoined
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
Can
you
not
contrive
to
bring
her
hither
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
more
easily
said
than
done
,
"
replied
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
as
coy
as
the
grocer
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
will
try
to
oblige
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
quitted
his
companions
,
and
returning
shortly
afterwards
,
said
,
"
My
mistress
has
likewise
disappeared
.
<EOS>
I
found
the
old
piper
seated
at
the
entrance
of
Bishop
Kempe
's
chapel
,
attended
by
his
dog
--
but
he
missed
his
daughter
when
he
awoke
in
the
morning
,
and
is
in
great
trouble
about
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Strange
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Etherege
<EOS>
;
"
I
begin
to
think
the
place
is
enchanted
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
seem
so
,
indeed
,
"
replied
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
While
they
were
thus
conversing
,
Pillichody
,
who
was
leaning
against
a
column
,
with
his
eye
fixed
upon
the
door
leading
to
Saint
Faith
's
,
observed
it
open
,
and
the
apprentice
issue
from
it
accompanied
by
two
masked
females
.
<EOS>
All
three
attempted
to
dart
across
the
transept
and
gain
the
northern
entrance
,
but
they
were
Intercepted
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
caught
hold
of
Leonard
's
arm
,
and
Rochester
seized
her
whom
he
judged
by
the
garb
to
be
Amabel
,
while
Parravicin
,
recognising
Nizza
Macascree
,
as
he
thought
,
by
her
dress
,
detained
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
,
Leonard
?
"
demanded
the
grocer
,
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
an
explanation
instantly
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
;
"
but
think
not
of
me
--
think
only
of
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
father!--my
father
!
"
cried
the
damsel
,
who
had
been
detained
by
Parravicin
,
taking
off
her
mask
,
and
rushing
towards
the
grocer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
then
have
I
got
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
piper
's
daughter
,
I
'll
be
sworn
,
"
replied
Etherege
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
"
replied
Nizza
,
unmasking
.
<EOS>
"
I
changed
dresses
with
Amabel
,
and
hoped
by
so
doing
to
accomplish
her
escape
,
but
we
have
been
baffled
.
<EOS>
However
,
as
her
father
is
here
,
it
is
of
little
consequence
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Amabel
,
"
said
the
grocer
,
repulsing
her
,
"
before
I
receive
you
again
<EOS>
,
I
must
be
assured
that
you
have
not
been
alone
with
the
Earl
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
not
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
Visit
your
displeasure
on
my
head
.
<EOS>
I
carried
her
off
and
would
have
wedded
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
motive
had
you
for
this
strange
conduct
?
"
asked
Bloundel
,
incredulously
.
 
<EOS>
Before
Leonard
could
answer
,
Pillichody
stepped
forward
,
and
said
to
the
grocer
,
"
Mr.
Bloundel
,
you
are
deceived
--
on
the
faith
of
a
soldier
you
are
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Peace
,
fool
!
<EOS>
"
said
Rochester
,
"
I
will
not
be
outdone
in
generosity
by
an
apprentice
.
<EOS>
Leonard
Holt
speaks
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
"
replied
Bloundel
,
"
he
shall
never
enter
my
house
again
.
<EOS>
Send
for
your
indentures
to
-
night
,
"
he
continued
sharply
,
to
Leonard
,
"
but
never
venture
to
approach
me
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Father
,
you
are
mistaken
,
"
cried
Amabel
.
"
<EOS>
Leonard
Holt
is
not
to
blame
.
<EOS>
I
alone
deserve
your
displeasure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
silent
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
the
apprentice
;
"
you
destroy
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
care
not
what
happens
to
me
,
provided
you
escape
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
home
,
mistress
,
"
cried
the
grocer
,
dragging
her
through
the
crowd
which
had
gathered
round
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
is
a
pretty
conclusion
to
the
adventure
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Parravicin
;
"
but
where
is
the
apprentice
--
and
where
is
the
pretty
Nizza
Macascree
?
'
<EOS>
Fore
heaven
,
"
he
added
,
as
he
looked
around
for
them
in
vain
,
"
I
should
not
wonder
if
they
have
eloped
together
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
I
,
"
replied
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
I
admire
the
youth
's
spirit
,
and
trust
he
may
be
more
fortunate
with
his
second
mistress
than
with
his
first
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
my
business
to
prevent
that
,
"
rejoined
Parravicin
.
"
<EOS>
Help
me
to
search
for
her
.

<EOS>
THE
AMULET
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
grocer
disappeared
with
his
daughter
,
Nizza
Macascree
,
who
had
anxiously
watched
the
apprentice
,
observed
him
turn
deadly
pale
,
and
stagger
;
and
instantly
springing
to
his
side
,
she
supported
him
to
a
neighbouring
column
,
against
which
he
leaned
till
he
had
in
some
degree
recovered
from
the
shock
.
<EOS>
He
then
accompanied
her
to
Bishop
Kempe
's
beautiful
chapel
in
the
northern
aisle
,
where
she
expected
to
find
her
father
;
but
it
was
empty
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
back
presently
,
"
said
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
no
doubt
making
the
rounds
of
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
Bell
will
take
care
of
him
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
on
that
bench
while
I
procure
you
some
refreshment
.
<EOS>
You
appear
much
in
need
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
without
waiting
for
a
reply
,
she
ran
off
,
and
presently
afterwards
returned
with
a
small
loaf
of
bread
and
a
bottle
of
beer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
eat
,
"
said
Leonard
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
But
seeing
that
his
kind
provider
looked
greatly
disappointed
,
he
swallowed
a
few
mouthfuls
,
and
raised
the
bottle
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
,
a
sudden
feeling
of
sickness
seized
him
,
and
he
set
it
down
untasted
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
ails
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Nizza
,
noticing
his
altered
looks
with
uneasiness
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
felt
so
ill
before
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
were
suffering
from
agitation
,
"
she
rejoined
,
as
a
fearful
foreboding
crossed
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
speedily
released
from
further
trouble
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
am
attacked
by
the
plague
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
say
not
so
!
<EOS>
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
mistaken
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
though
she
tried
to
persuade
herself
she
spoke
the
truth
,
her
heart
could
not
be
deceived
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
scarcely
desire
to
live
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
,
in
a
melancholy
tone
,
"
for
life
has
lost
all
charms
for
me
.
<EOS>
But
do
not
remain
here
,
or
you
may
be
infected
by
the
distemper
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
leave
you
,
"
she
hastily
rejoined
;
"
that
is
,
"
she
added
,
checking
herself
,
"
till
I
have
placed
you
in
charge
of
some
one
who
will
watch
over
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
one
will
watch
over
me
,
"
returned
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
My
master
has
dismissed
me
from
his
service
,
and
I
have
no
other
friend
left
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
tell
one
of
the
vergers
<EOS>
what
is
the
matter
with
me
,
he
will
summon
the
Examiner
of
Health
,
who
will
bring
a
litter
to
convey
me
to
the
pest
-
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
go
thither
your
fate
is
sealed
,
"
replied
Nizza
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
I
do
not
desire
to
live
,
"
returned
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
indulge
in
these
gloomy
thoughts
,
or
you
are
certain
to
bring
about
a
fatal
result
,
"
said
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
Would
I
knew
how
to
aid
you
!
<EOS>
But
I
still
hope
you
are
deceived
as
to
the
nature
of
your
attack
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
be
deceived
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
whose
countenance
proclaimed
the
anguish
he
endured
.
"
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
,
I
think
,
is
interested
about
me
,
"
he
continued
,
describing
the
physician
's
residence--"if
you
will
inform
him
of
my
seizure
,
he
may
,
perhaps
,
come
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
fly
to
him
instantly
,
"
replied
Nizza
;
and
she
was
about
to
quit
the
chapel
,
when
she
was
stopped
by
Parravicin
and
his
companions
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
pass
,
"
she
said
,
trying
to
force
her
way
through
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
fast
,
fair
Nizza
,
"
rejoined
Parravicin
,
forcing
her
back
,
"
I
must
have
a
few
words
with
you
.
<EOS>
Have
I
overrated
her
charms
?
<EOS>
"
he
added
to
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
Is
she
not
surpassingly
beautiful
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
good
sooth
she
is
,
"
replied
the
earl
,
gazing
at
her
with
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
the
nut
-
brown
skin
of
Cleopatra
!
"
cried
Pillichody
,
"
she
beats
Mrs.
Disbrowe
,
Sir
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
seen
any
one
so
lovely
,
"
said
the
knight
,
attempting
to
press
her
hand
to
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
"
Release
me
,
sir
,
"
cried
Nizza
,
struggling
to
free
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
till
I
have
told
you
how
much
I
love
you
,
"
returned
the
knight
,
ardently
.
 
<EOS>
"
Love
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
echoed
,
scornfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
love
you
,
"
reiterated
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
strange
if
I
,
who
profess
myself
so
great
an
admirer
of
beauty
,
did
otherwise
.
<EOS>
I
am
passionately
enamoured
of
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
accompany
me
,
fair
Nizza
,
you
shall
change
your
humble
garb
for
the
richest
attire
that
gold
can
purchase
,
shall
dwell
in
a
magnificent
mansion
,
and
have
troops
of
servants
at
your
command
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
my
whole
fortune
,
together
with
myself
,
shall
be
placed
at
your
disposal
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
not
listen
to
him
,
Nizza
,
"
cried
Leonard
Holt
,
in
a
faint
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
assured
I
will
not
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Your
insulting
proposal
only
heightens
the
disgust
<EOS>
I
at
first
conceived
for
you
,
"
she
added
to
the
knight
:
"
I
reject
it
with
scorn
,
and
command
you
to
let
me
pass
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
if
you
put
on
these
airs
,
sweetheart
,
"
replied
Parravicin
,
insolently
<EOS>
,
"
I
must
alter
my
tone
likewise
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
accustomed
to
play
the
humble
suitor
to
persons
of
your
condition
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
,
"
replied
Nizza
;
"
neither
am
I
accustomed
to
this
unwarrantable
usage
.
<EOS>
Let
me
go
.
<EOS>
My
errand
is
one
of
life
and
death
.
<EOS>
Do
not
hinder
me
,
or
you
will
have
a
heavy
crime
on
your
soul
--
heavier
,
it
may
be
,
than
any
that
now
loads
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Parravicin
,
struck
by
her
earnest
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
fetch
assistance
,
"
she
replied
,
"
for
one
suddenly
assailed
by
the
pestilence
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
the
knight
,
trembling
,
and
relinquishing
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
"
My
path
is
ever
crossed
by
that
hideous
spectre
.
<EOS>
Is
it
your
father
who
is
thus
attacked
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
replied
,
pointing
to
Leonard
,
"
it
is
that
youth
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
apprentice
!
"
exclaimed
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
him
.
<EOS>
Let
us
be
gone
,
"
he
added
to
his
companions
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
dangerous
to
remain
here
longer
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
they
all
departed
except
Parravicin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
with
us
,
Nizza
,
"
said
the
latter
;
"
we
will
send
assistance
to
the
sufferer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
told
you
my
determination
<EOS>
,
"
she
rejoined
;
"
I
will
not
stir
a
footstep
with
you
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
have
any
compassion
in
your
nature
,
you
will
not
detain
me
longer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
leave
you
here
to
certain
destruction
,
"
said
the
knight
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
come
with
me
whether
you
will
or
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
,
he
advanced
towards
her
,
while
she
retreated
towards
Leonard
,
who
,
rising
with
difficulty
,
placed
himself
between
her
and
her
persecutor
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
advance
another
footstep
,
"
cried
the
apprentice
,
"
I
will
fling
myself
upon
you
,
and
the
contact
may
be
fatal
.
"
 
<EOS>
Parravicin
gazed
,
furiously
at
him
,
and
half
unsheathed
his
sword
.
<EOS>
But
the
next
moment
he
returned
it
to
the
scabbard
,
and
exclaiming
,
"
Another
time
!
<EOS>
another
time
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
darted
after
his
companions
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
scarcely
gone
,
when
Leonard
reeled
against
the
wall
,
and
before
Nizza
could
catch
him
,
fell
in
a
state
of
insensibility
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
After
vainly
attempting
to
raise
him
,
Nizza
flew
for
assistance
,
and
had
just
passed
through
the
door
of
the
chapel
,
when
she
met
Judith
Malmayns
and
Chowles
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
stopped
them
,
and
acquainting
them
with
the
apprentice
's
condition
,
implored
them
to
take
charge
of
him
while
she
went
in
search
of
Doctor
Hodges
.
 
<EOS>
"
Before
you
go
,
"
said
Judith
,
"
let
me
make
sure
that
he
is
attacked
by
the
plague
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
some
other
disorder
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
indeed
,
"
said
Nizza
,
pausing
;
<EOS>
"
but
I
fear
the
contrary
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
returned
with
them
to
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
Raising
the
apprentice
with
the
greatest
ease
,
Judith
tore
open
his
doublet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
suspicion
is
correct
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
malignant
smile
.
<EOS>
"
Here
is
the
fatal
sign
upon
his
breast
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
fetch
Doctor
Hodges
instantly
,
"
cried
Nizza
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
so
,
"
replied
Judith
;
"
we
will
convey
him
to
the
vaults
in
Saint
Faith
's
,
where
poor
Mr.
Quatremain
has
just
been
taken
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
better
there
than
in
the
pest
-
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Anything
is
better
than
that
,
"
said
Nizza
,
shuddering
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
was
gone
,
Chowles
took
off
his
long
black
cloak
,
and
,
throwing
it
over
the
apprentice
,
laid
him
at
full
length
upon
the
bench
,
and
,
assisted
by
Judith
,
carried
him
towards
the
choir
.
<EOS>
As
they
proceeded
,
Chowles
called
out
,
"
Make
way
for
one
sick
of
the
plague
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
crowd
instantly
divided
,
and
gave
them
free
passage
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
they
descended
to
Saint
Faith
's
,
and
,
shaping
their
course
to
the
vault
,
deposited
their
burden
on
the
very
bed
lately
occupied
by
the
unfortunate
sexton
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
come
here
to
die
,
"
observed
Judith
to
her
companion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
attack
is
but
a
slight
one
,
and
he
might
with
care
recover
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
bargain
with
the
Earl
of
Rochester
for
his
removal
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Take
heed
how
you
make
such
a
proposal
to
his
lordship
,
"
returned
Chowles
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
From
what
I
have
seen
,
he
is
likely
to
,
revolt
at
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Every
man
is
glad
to
get
rid
of
a
rival
,
"
rejoined
Judith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Granted
,
"
replied
Chowles
;
"
but
no
man
will
_
pay
_
for
the
riddance
when
the
plague
will
accomplish
it
for
him
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
With
due
attention
,
I
would
answer
for
that
youth
's
recovery
,
"
said
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
an
incurable
case
,
like
Mr.
Quatremain
's
.
<EOS>
And
so
Doctor
Hodges
,
when
he
comes
,
will
pronounce
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Shortly
after
this
,
Nizza
Macaseree
appeared
with
a
countenance
fraught
with
anxiety
,
and
informed
them
that
Doctor
Hodges
was
from
home
,
and
would
not
probably
return
till
late
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
unfortunate
,
"
said
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Luckily
,
however
,
there
are
other
doctors
in
London
,
and
some
who
understand
the
treatment
of
the
plague
far
better
than
he
does
--
Sibbald
,
the
apothecary
of
Clerkenwell
,
for
instance
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
Sibbald
would
attend
him
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Nizza
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
he
would
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Malmayns
,
"
if
he
were
paid
for
it
.
<EOS>
But
you
seem
greatly
interested
about
this
youth
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
young
,
and
know
what
effect
good
looks
and
a
manly
deportment
have
upon
our
sex
.
<EOS>
He
has
won
your
heart
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
You
need
not
seek
to
disguise
it
.
<EOS>
Your
blushes
answer
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
truce
to
this
,
"
cried
Nizza
,
whose
cheeks
glowed
with
shame
and
anger
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
answer
a
plain
question
,
I
suppose
,
"
returned
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
his
life
dear
to
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dearer
than
my
own
?
<EOS>
"
replied
Nizza
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
as
much
,
"
returned
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
What
will
you
give
me
to
save
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
,
"
rejoined
Nizza
,
with
a
troubled
look--"nothing
<EOS>
but
thanks
to
give
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Think
again
,
"
said
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Girls
like
you
,
if
they
have
no
money
,
have
generally
some
trinket
--
some
valuable
in
their
possession
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
my
case
,
"
said
Nizza
,
bursting
into
tears
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
received
a
present
in
my
life
,
and
never
desired
one
till
now
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
your
father
must
have
some
money
?
"
said
Judith
,
inquisitively
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
,
"
replied
Nizza
,
"
but
I
will
ask
him
.
<EOS>
What
sum
will
content
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bring
all
you
can
,
"
returned
Judith
,
"
and
I
will
do
my
best
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Nizza
then
departed
,
while
Judith
,
with
the
assistance
of
Chowles
,
covered
Leonard
with
blankets
,
and
proceeded
to
light
a
fire
.
<EOS>
Long
before
this
,
the
sick
youth
was
restored
to
animation
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
quite
light
-
headed
and
unconscious
of
his
situation
,
and
rambled
about
Amabel
and
her
father
.
<EOS>
After
administering
such
remedies
as
she
thought
fit
,
and
as
were
at
hand
,
Judith
sat
down
with
the
coffin
-
maker
beside
a
small
table
,
and
entered
into
conversation
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Chowles
,
in
an
indifferent
tone
,
as
he
poured
out
a
glass
of
brandy
,
"
is
it
to
be
kill
or
cure
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
decided
,
"
replied
Judith
,
pledging
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
still
do
not
see
what
gain
there
would
be
in
shortening
his
career
,
"
observed
Chowles
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
there
would
be
no
gain
,
there
would
be
gratification
,
"
replied
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
He
has
offended
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
that
is
the
case
,
I
have
nothing
further
to
say
,
"
returned
Chowles
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
promised
the
piper
's
daughter
to
save
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
what
she
offers
,
"
rejoined
Judith
;
"
all
will
depend
upon
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
extraordinary
,
"
observed
Chowles
,
after
a
pause
,
"
that
while
all
around
us
are
sick
or
dying
of
the
pestilence
,
we
should
escape
contagion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
not
afraid
of
it
,
"
replied
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Besides
,
we
are
part
of
the
plague
ourselves
.
<EOS>
But
I
_
have
_
been
attacked
,
and
am
,
therefore
,
safe
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
replied
Chowles
;
"
I
had
forgotten
that
.
<EOS>
Well
,
if
I
fall
ill
,
you
Sha'n't
nurse
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
be
able
to
help
yourself
then
,
"
returned
Judith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Eh
!
"
exclaimed
Chowles
,
shifting
uneasily
on
his
seat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
afraid
,
"
returned
Judith
,
laughing
at
his
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
every
care
of
you
.
<EOS>
We
are
necessary
to
each
other
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
we
are
,
"
replied
Chowles
;
"
so
we
are
;
<EOS>
and
if
nothing
else
could
,
that
consideration
would
make
us
true
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
assented
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
reap
as
rich
a
harvest
as
we
can
,
and
when
the
scourge
is
over
,
we
can
enjoy
ourselves
upon
the
spoils
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Exactly
so
,
"
replied
Chowles
.
<EOS>
"
My
business
is
daily
-
hourly
on
the
increase
.
<EOS>
My
men
are
incessantly
employed
,
and
my
only
fear
is
that
an
order
will
be
issued
to
bury
the
dead
without
coffins
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
unlikely
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Malmayns
.
<EOS>
"
But
there
are
plenty
of
ways
of
getting
money
in
a
season
like
this
.
<EOS>
If
one
fails
,
we
must
resort
to
another
.
<EOS>
I
shall
make
all
I
can
,
and
in
the
shortest
manner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Right
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Chowles
,
with
,
an
atrocious
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Right
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
found
out
a
means
of
propagating
the
distemper
,
"
pursued
Judith
,
in
a
low
tone
,
and
with
a
mysterious
air
,
"
of
inoculating
whomsoever
<EOS>
I
please
with
the
plague
-
venom
.
<EOS>
I
have
tried
the
experiment
on
Mr.
Quatremain
and
that
youth
,
and
you
see
how
well
it
has
answered
in
both
instances
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
Chowles
,
looking
askance
at
her
.
"
<EOS>
But
why
destroy
the
poor
minor
canon
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
I
want
to
get
hold
of
the
treasure
discovered
by
the
help
of
the
Mosaical
rods
in
Saint
Faith
's
,
which
by
right
belonged
to
my
husband
,
and
which
is
now
in
Mr.
Quatremain
's
possession
,
"
replied
Judith
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
"
nodded
Chowles
.
 
<EOS>
While
they
were
thus
conversing
,
Nizza
Macascree
again
returned
,
and
informed
them
that
she
could
not
find
her
father
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
left
the
cathedral
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
will
not
,
probably
,
return
till
nightfall
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
it
,
on
your
account
,
"
observed
Judith
,
coldly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
will
not
have
the
cruelty
to
neglect
the
poor
young
man
till
then
--
you
will
take
proper
precautions
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Nizza
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
exert
myself
for
one
about
whose
recovery
<EOS>
I
am
indifferent
?
"
said
Judith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
exclaimed
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
in
vain
to
argue
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
must
appeal
to
your
avarice
,
since
you
are
deaf
to
the
pleadings
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
bethought
me
that
I
have
an
old
gold
coin
,
which
was
given
me
years
ago
by
my
father
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
it
had
been
my
mother
's
,
and
charged
me
not
to
part
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
should
have
done
so
,
except
in
an
emergency
like
the
present
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
,
she
drew
from
her
bosom
a
broad
gold
piece
.
<EOS>
A
hole
was
bored
through
it
,
and
it
was
suspended
from
her
neck
by
a
chain
of
twisted
hair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
look
at
it
,
"
said
Judith
taking
the
coin
.
<EOS>
"
Who
gave
you
this
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
in
an
altered
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
father
?
<EOS>
"
replied
Nizza
;
"
I
have
just
told
you
so
.
<EOS>
It
was
my
mother
's
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Impossible
!
"
exclaimed
Judith
!
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
ever
seen
it
before
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Nizza
,
astonished
at
the
change
in
the
nurse
's
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
replied
Judith
,
"
and
in
very
different
hands
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
surprise
me
,
"
cried
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
Explain
yourself
,
I
beseech
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
now
--
not
now
,
"
cried
Judith
,
hastily
returning
the
coin
.
"
<EOS>
And
this
is
to
be
mine
in
case
<EOS>
I
cure
the
youth
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
so
,
"
replied
Nizza
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
make
yourself
easy
,
"
rejoined
Judith
;
"
he
shall
be
well
again
in
less
than
two
days
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
she
set
a
pan
on
the
fire
,
and
began
to
prepare
a
poultice
,
the
materials
for
which
she
took
from
a
small
oaken
chest
in
one
corner
of
the
vault
.
<EOS>
Nizza
looked
on
anxiously
,
and
while
they
were
thus
employed
,
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
,
and
<EOS>
Chowles
opening
it
,
found
the
piper
and
one
of
the
vergers
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
is
it
you
,
father
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Nizza
,
rushing
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
I
have
found
you
,
"
returned
the
piper
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
began
to
fear
some
misfortune
must
have
befallen
you
.
<EOS>
Missing
you
in
the
morning
,
I
traversed
the
cathedral
in
search
of
you
with
Bell
,
<EOS>
well
knowing
,
if
you
were
in
the
crowd
,
she
would
speedily
discover
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
daughter
then
hastily
recounted
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
When
the
piper
heard
that
she
had
promised
the
piece
of
gold
to
the
plague
-
nurse
,
a
cloud
came
over
his
open
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
never
part
with
it
,
"
he
said--"never
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
amulet
,
and
if
you
lose
it
,
or
give
it
away
,
your
good
luck
will
go
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Judith
Malmayns
says
she
has
seen
it
before
,
"
rejoined
Nizza
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
such
thing
,
"
cried
the
piper
hastily
,
"
she
knows
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
But
come
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
stay
here
longer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
father
--
dear
father!--I
want
a
small
sum
to
pay
the
nurse
for
attending
this
poor
young
man
,
"
cried
Nizza
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
money
,
"
replied
the
piper
;
"
and
if
I
had
,
I
should
not
throw
it
away
in
so
silly
a
manner
.
<EOS>
Come
along
;
I
shall
begin
think
you
are
in
love
with
the
youth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
will
not
be
far
wide
of
the
mark
,
"
observed
Judith
,
coarsely
.
 
<EOS>
The
piper
uttered
an
angry
exclamation
,
and
taking
his
daughter
's
hand
,
dragged
her
out
of
the
vault
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
get
your
fee
,
"
laughed
Chowles
,
as
they
were
left
alone
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
it
appears
,
"
replied
Judith
,
taking
the
pan
from
the
fire
;
"
there
is
no
use
in
wasting
a
poultice
.
"
 
<EOS>
Shortly
after
this
,
the
door
of
the
vault
again
opened
,
and
Parravicin
looked
in
.
<EOS>
He
held
a
handkerchief
sprinkled
with
vinegar
to
his
face
,
and
had
evidently
,
from
the
manner
in
which
he
spoke
,
some
antidote
against
the
plague
in
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nizza
Macascree
has
been
here
,
has
she
not
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
just
left
with
her
father
,
"
replied
Judith
.
 
<EOS>
Parravicin
beckoned
her
to
follow
him
,
and
led
the
way
to
the
north
aisle
of
Saint
Faith
's
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
the
apprentice
likely
to
recover
?
"
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Judith
;
"
that
depends
upon
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Nizza
Macascree
offered
me
a
large
reward
to
cure
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
he
any
connexion
of
hers
?
"
asked
the
knight
,
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
None
whatever
,
"
returned
Judith
,
with
a
significant
smile
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
may
possibly
be
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
as
much
,
"
muttered
the
knight
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
never
_
shall
_
recover
,
"
said
Judith
,
halting
,
and
speaking
in
a
low
tone
,
"
if
you
make
it
worth
my
while
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
read
my
wishes
,
"
replied
Parravicin
,
in
a
sombre
tone
.
<EOS>
"
Take
this
purse
,
and
free
me
from
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
will
never
more
cross
your
path
,
"
replied
Judith
,
eagerly
grasping
the
reward
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
"
exclaimed
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
"
What
has
passed
between
us
must
be
secret
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
the
grave
which
shall
soon
close
over
the
victim
,
"
she
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
Parravicin
shuddered
,
and
hurried
away
,
while
Judith
returned
at
a
slow
pace
,
and
chinking
the
purse
as
she
went
to
the
vault
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
scarcely
passed
through
the
door
,
when
Nizza
Macascree
appeared
from
behind
one
of
the
massive
pillars
.
<EOS>
"
This
dreadful
crime
must
be
prevented
,
"
she
cried--"but
how
?
<EOS>
If
I
run
to
give
the
alarm
,
it
may
be
executed
,
and
no
one
will
believe
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
try
to
prevent
it
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
Crossing
the
channel
,
she
was
about
to
enter
the
vault
,
when
Chowles
stepped
forth
.
<EOS>
She
shrank
backwards
,
and
allowed
him
to
pass
,
and
then
trying
the
door
,
found
it
unfastened
.

<EOS>
HOW
LEONARD
WAS
CURED
OF
THE
PLAGUE
.
 
<EOS>
Nizza
Macascree
found
Judith
leaning
over
her
intended
victim
,
and
examining
the
plague
-
spot
on
his
breast
.
<EOS>
The
nurse
was
so
occupied
by
her
task
that
she
did
not
hear
the
door
open
,
and
it
was
not
until
the
piper
's
daughter
was
close
beside
her
,
that
she
was
aware
of
her
presence
.
<EOS>
Hastily
drawing
the
blankets
over
the
apprentice
,
she
then
turned
,
and
regarded
Nizza
with
a
half
-
fearful
,
half
-
menacing
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
brings
you
here
again
?
<EOS>
"
she
inquired
,
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ask
your
own
heart
,
and
it
will
tell
you
,
"
rejoined
Nizza
,
boldly
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
to
preserve
the
life
of
this
poor
youth
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
think
you
can
nurse
him
better
than
I
can
,
you
can
take
my
place
and
welcome
,
"
returned
Judith
,
affecting
not
to
understand
her
;
"
I
have
plenty
of
other
business
to
attend
to
,
and
should
be
glad
to
be
released
from
the
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
she
already
have
effected
her
fell
purpose
?
"
<EOS>
thought
Nizza
,
gazing
at
the
apprentice
,
whose
perturbed
features
proclaimed
that
his
slumber
procured
him
no
rest
from
suffering
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
--
no
--
she
has
not
had
time
.
<EOS>
I
accept
your
offer
,
"
she
added
,
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
what
will
your
father
say
to
this
arrangement
?
"
asked
Judith
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
he
knows
my
motive
,
he
will
not
blame
me
,
"
answered
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
Here
I
take
my
place
,
"
she
continued
,
seating
herself
,
"
and
will
not
quit
it
till
he
is
out
of
danger
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
love
for
this
youth
borders
upon
insanity
,
"
cried
Judith
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
destroy
yourself
thus
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Neither
shall
you
destroy
him
,
"
retorted
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
to
prevent
the
commission
of
the
crime
you
meditate
,
and
for
which
you
have
been
_
paid
_
,
that
I
am
determined
to
remain
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
she
said
this
,
a
singular
and
frightful
change
took
place
in
the
nurse
's
appearance
.
<EOS>
A
slight
expression
of
alarm
was
at
first
visible
,
but
it
was
instantly
succeeded
by
a
look
so
savage
and
vindictive
,
that
Nizza
almost
repented
having
provoked
the
ire
of
so
unscrupulous
a
person
.
<EOS>
But
summoning
up
all
her
resolution
,
she
returned
Judith
's
glance
with
one
as
stern
and
steady
,
if
not
so
malignant
as
her
own
.
<EOS>
A
deep
silence
prevailed
for
a
few
minutes
,
during
which
each
fancied
she
could
read
the
other
's
thoughts
.
<EOS>
In
Nizza
's
opinion
,
the
nurse
was
revolving
some
desperate
expedient
,
and
she
kept
on
her
guard
,
lest
an
attack
should
be
made
upon
her
life
.
<EOS>
And
some
such
design
did
,
in
reality
,
cross
Judith
;
but
abandoning
it
as
soon
as
formed
,
she
resolved
to
have
recourse
to
more
secret
,
but
not
less
certain
measures
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
she
said
,
breaking
silence
,
"
since
you
are
determined
to
have
your
own
way
,
and
catch
the
plague
,
and
most
likely
perish
from
it
,
I
shall
not
try
to
hinder
you
.
<EOS>
Do
what
you
please
,
and
see
what
will
come
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
made
as
if
about
to
depart
;
but
finding
Nizza
did
not
attempt
to
stop
her
,
she
halted
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
leave
you
thus
,
"
she
continued
;
"
if
you
_
will
_
remain
,
take
this
ointment
,
"
producing
a
small
jar
,
"
and
rub
the
plague
-
spot
with
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
sovereign
remedy
,
and
will
certainly
effect
a
cure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
touch
it
,
"
returned
Nizza
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
death
,
then
,
be
upon
your
head
,
"
rejoined
Judith
,
quitting
the
vault
,
and
closing
the
door
after
her
.
 
<EOS>
Greatly
relieved
by
her
departure
,
Nizza
began
to
consider
what
she
should
do
,
and
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
remove
the
apprentice
to
some
safer
place
.
"
<EOS>
While
occupied
with
these
reflections
,
the
object
of
her
solicitude
heaved
a
deep
sigh
,
and
opening
his
eyes
,
fixed
them
upon
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
,
however
,
that
he
did
not
know
her
,
but
as
far
as
could
be
gathered
from
his
ravings
,
mistook
her
for
Amabel
.
<EOS>
By
degrees
he
grew
calmer
,
and
the
throbbing
anguish
of
the
tumour
in
some
measure
subsiding
,
his
faculties
returned
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
am
I
?
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
pressing
his
hand
forcibly
to
his
brow
,
"
and
what
is
the
matter
with
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
a
vault
,
near
Saint
Faith
's
,
"
replied
Nizza
,
"
and
--
<EOS>
I
will
not
deceive
you
--
the
disorder
you
are
labouring
under
is
the
plague
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
plague
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Leonard
,
with
a
look
of
horror
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
now
I
recollect
.
<EOS>
I
was
attacked
immediately
after
Amabel
's
departure
with
her
father
.
<EOS>
Heaven
be
praised
!
<EOS>
she
is
safe
.
<EOS>
That
is
some
consolation
amid
all
this
misery
.
<EOS>
Could
my
master
behold
me
now
,
he
would
pity
me
,
and
so
perhaps
would
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heed
her
not
,
"
rejoined
Nizza
,
in
a
slightly
reproachful
tone
,
"
she
does
not
deserve
consideration
.
<EOS>
To
return
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
safe
here
.
<EOS>
Judith
Malmayns
has
been
hired
to
take
away
your
life
.
<EOS>
Are
you
able
to
move
hence
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
raising
himself
on
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wrap
a
blanket
round
you
,
then
,
and
follow
me
,
"
said
Nizza
,
taking
up
the
lamp
and
hastening
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
with
a
cry
of
anguish--"it
is
locked
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
building
is
destined
to
be
my
prison
,
and
that
treacherous
woman
my
gaoler
,
"
groaned
Leonard
,
sinking
backwards
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
despair
,
"
cried
Nizza
;
"
I
will
accomplish
your
deliverance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
tried
,
by
knocking
against
the
door
and
by
loud
outcries
,
to
give
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
But
no
answer
was
returned
,
and
she
soon
became
convinced
that
Judith
had
fastened
the
door
of
the
charnel
,
which
,
it
will
be
remembered
,
lay
between
the
vault
and
the
body
of
Saint
Faith
's
.
<EOS>
Hence
,
no
sound
could
teach
the
outer
structure
.
<EOS>
Disturbed
by
what
had
just
occurred
.
<EOS>
Leonard
's
senses
again
wandered
;
but
,
exerting
all
her
powers
to
tranquillize
him
,
Nizza
at
last
succeeded
so
well
that
he
sunk
into
a
slumber
.
 
<EOS>
Almost
regarding
his
situation
as
hopeless
,
she
took
up
the
lamp
,
and
searching
the
vault
,
found
the
pan
containing
the
half
-
made
poultice
.
<EOS>
The
fire
smouldered
on
the
hearth
,
and
replenishing
it
from
a
scanty
supply
in
one
corner
,
she
heated
the
poultice
and
applied
it
to
the
tumour
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
she
continued
her
search
.
<EOS>
But
though
she
found
several
phials
,
each
bearing
the
name
of
some
remedy
for
the
pestilence
,
her
distrust
of
Judith
would
not
allow
her
to
use
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
Resuming
her
seat
by
the
couch
of
the
sufferer
,
and
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
anxiety
,
she
presently
dropped
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
awakened
after
awhile
by
a
slight
noise
near
her
,
and
beheld
Judith
bending
over
the
apprentice
,
with
a
pot
of
ointment
in
her
hand
,
which
she
was
about
to
apply
to
the
part
affected
.
<EOS>
The
poultice
had
already
been
removed
.
<EOS>
Uttering
a
loud
cry
,
Nizza
started
to
her
feet
,
and
snatching
the
ointment
from
the
nurse
,
threw
it
away
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
latter
recovered
from
her
surprise
,
she
seized
her
assailant
,
and
forced
her
into
the
seat
she
had
just
quitted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stir
not
till
I
give
you
permission
,
"
she
cried
,
fiercely
;
"
I
wish
to
cure
this
young
man
,
if
you
will
let
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
intend
to
murder
him
,
"
replied
Nizza
;
"
but
while
I
live
you
shall
never
accomplish
your
atrocious
purpose
.
<EOS>
Help
!
<EOS>
help
!
"
<EOS>
And
she
uttered
a
prolonged
piercing
scream
.
 
<EOS>
"
Peace
!
<EOS>
or
I
will
strangle
you
,
"
cried
Judith
,
compressing
Nizza
's
slender
throat
with
a
powerful
gripe
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
would
,
in
all
probability
,
have
executed
her
terrible
threat
,
if
a
secret
door
in
the
wall
had
not
suddenly
opened
and
admitted
Solomon
Eagle
.
<EOS>
A
torch
supplied
the
place
of
his
brazier
,
and
he
held
it
aloft
,
and
threw
its
ruddy
light
upon
the
scene
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
him
,
Judith
relinquished
her
grasp
,
and
glared
at
him
with
a
mixture
of
defiance
and
apprehension
;
while
Nizza
,
half
dead
with
terror
,
instantly
rushed
towards
him
,
and
throwing
herself
at
his
feet
,
besought
him
to
save
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
harm
shall
befall
you
,
"
replied
Solomon
Eagle
,
extending
his
arm
over
her
.
"
<EOS>
Tell
me
what
has
happened
.
"
 
<EOS>
Nizza
hastily
explained
the
motive
of
Judith
's
attack
upon
her
life
.
<EOS>
The
plague
-
nurse
endeavoured
to
defend
herself
,
and
,
in
her
turn
,
charged
her
accuser
with
a
like
attempt
.
<EOS>
But
Solomon
Eagle
interrupted
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
silent
,
false
woman
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
"
and
think
not
to
delude
me
with
these
idle
fabrications
.
<EOS>
I
fully
believe
that
you
would
have
taken
the
life
of
this
poor
youth
,
and
,
did
I
not
regard
you
as
one
of
the
necessary
agents
of
Heaven
's
vengeance
,
I
would
instantly
deliver
you
up
to
justice
.
<EOS>
But
the
measure
of
your
iniquities
is
not
yet
filled
up
.
<EOS>
Your
former
crimes
are
not
unknown
to
me
.
<EOS>
Neither
is
the
last
dark
deed
,
which
you
imagined
concealed
from
every
human
eye
,
hidden
from
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
what
you
mean
,
"
returned
Judith
,
trembling
,
in
spite
of
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
,
then
,
"
rejoined
Solomon
Eagle
,
catching
her
hand
,
and
dragging
her
into
the
furthest
corner
of
the
vault
.
"
<EOS>
Give
ear
to
me
,
"
he
continued
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
and
doubt
,
if
you
can
,
that
I
have
witnessed
what
I
relate
.
<EOS>
I
saw
you
enter
a
small
chamber
behind
the
vestry
,
in
which
Thomas
Quatremain
,
who
once
filled
the
place
of
minor
canon
in
this
cathedral
,
was
laid
.
<EOS>
No
one
was
there
beside
yourself
and
the
dying
man
.
<EOS>
Your
first
business
was
to
search
his
vestments
,
and
take
away
his
keys
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
exclaimed
Judith
,
starting
.
 
<EOS>
"
While
securing
his
keys
,
"
pursued
Solomon
Eagle
,
"
the
owner
awakened
,
and
uttered
a
low
,
but
angry
remonstrance
.
<EOS>
Better
he
had
been
silent
.
<EOS>
Dipping
a
napkin
in
an
ewer
of
water
that
stood
beside
him
,
you
held
the
wet
cloth
over
his
face
,
and
did
not
remove
it
till
life
was
extinct
.
<EOS>
All
this
I
saw
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
not
reveal
it
,
"
said
Judith
,
tremblingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
,
"
replied
Solomon
Eagle
,
"
for
the
reasons
I
have
just
stated
;
namely
,
that
I
look
upon
you
as
one
of
the
scourges
appointed
by
Heaven
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
so
I
am
,
"
rejoined
Judith
,
with
impious
exultation
;
"
it
is
my
mission
to
destroy
and
pillage
,
and
I
will
fulfil
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Take
heed
you
do
not
exceed
it
,
"
replied
Solomon
Eagle
.
<EOS>
"
Lift
a
finger
against
either
of
these
young
persons
,
and
I
will
reveal
all
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
he
continued
,
menacingly
,
"
I
will
disclose
such
dreadful
things
against
you
,
that
you
will
assuredly
be
adjudged
to
a
gibbet
higher
than
the
highest
tower
of
this
proud
fane
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
defy
you
,
wretch
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
prove
nothing
against
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Defy
me?--ha
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Solomon
Eagle
,
with
a
terrible
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
First
,
"
he
added
,
dashing
her
backwards
against
the
wall--"first
,
to
prove
my
power
.
<EOS>
Next
,
"
he
continued
,
drawing
from
her
pockets
a
bunch
of
keys
,
"
to
show
that
I
speak
the
truth
.
<EOS>
These
were
taken
from
the
vest
of
the
murdered
man
.
<EOS>
No
one
,
as
yet
,
but
ourselves
,
knows
that
he
is
dead
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
who
shall
say
which
of
the
two
is
the
murderer
?
"
cried
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Villain
!
<EOS>
I
charge
you
with
the
deed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
,
indeed
,
well
fitted
for
your
appointed
task
,
"
returned
Solomon
Eagle
,
gazing
at
her
with
astonishment
,
"
for
sometimes
Heaven
,
for
its
own
wise
purpose
,
will
allow
the
children
of
hell
to
execute
its
vengeance
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
But
think
not
you
will
always
thus
escape
.
<EOS>
No
,
you
may
pursue
your
evil
course
for
a
while
--
you
,
and
your
companion
in
crime
;
but
a
day
of
retribution
will
arrive
for
both
--
a
day
when
ye
shall
be
devoured
,
living
,
by
flames
of
fire
--
when
all
your
sins
shall
arise
before
your
eyes
,
and
ye
shall
have
no
time
for
repentance
--
and
when
ye
shall
pass
from
one
fierce
fire
to
another
yet
fiercer
,
and
wholly
unquenchable
!
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
concluded
,
he
again
dashed
her
against
the
wall
with
such
violence
that
she
fell
senseless
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
he
said
,
turning
to
Nizza
Macascree
,
who
looked
on
in
alarm
and
surprise
,
"
what
can
I
do
for
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bear
this
youth
to
a
place
of
safety
,
"
was
her
answer
.
 
<EOS>
Solomon
Eagle
answered
by
lifting
up
the
pallet
upon
which
Leonard
was
laid
,
with
as
much
ease
as
if
it
had
been
an
infant
's
cradle
,
and
calling
on
Nizza
to
bring
the
torch
,
passed
with
his
burden
through
the
secret
door
.
<EOS>
Directing
her
to
close
it
after
them
,
he
took
his
way
alone
a
narrow
stone
passage
,
until
he
came
to
a
chink
in
the
wall
commanding
a
small
chamber
,
and
desired
her
to
look
through
it
.
<EOS>
She
obeyed
,
and
beheld
,
stretched
upon
a
couch
,
the
corpse
of
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
Mr.
Quatremain
,
the
minor
canon
,
"
she
said
,
retiring
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
returned
Solomon
Eagle
,
"
and
it
will
be
supposed
that
he
died
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
But
his
end
was
accelerated
by
Judith
Malmayns
.
"
 
<EOS>
Without
allowing
her
time
for
reply
,
he
pursued
his
course
,
traversing
another
long
,
narrow
passage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
we
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Nizza
,
as
they
arrived
at
the
foot
of
a
spiral
stone
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
"
Beneath
the
central
tower
of
the
cathedral
,
"
replied
Solomon
Eagle
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
you
to
a
cell
known
only
to
myself
,
where
this
youth
will
be
in
perfect
safety
.
"
 
<EOS>
Ascending
the
staircase
,
they
passed
through
an
arched
door
,
and
entered
the
great
northern
ambulatory
.
<EOS>
Nizza
gazed
down
for
a
moment
into
the
nave
,
but
all
was
buried
in
darkness
,
and
no
sound
reached
her
to
give
her
an
idea
that
any
one
was
below
.
<EOS>
Proceeding
towards
the
west
,
Solomon
Eagle
arrived
at
a
small
recess
in
the
wall
opposite
one
of
the
broad
-
arched
openings
looking
into
the
nave
,
and
entering
it
,
pressed
against
a
spring
at
the
further
extremity
,
and
a
stone
door
flying
open
,
discovered
a
secret
cell
,
on
the
floor
of
which
his
brazier
was
burning
.
<EOS>
Depositing
his
burden
on
the
floor
,
he
said
to
Nizza
,
"
He
is
now
safe
.
<EOS>
Go
in
search
of
proper
assistance
,
and
I
will
watch
by
him
till
you
return
.
"
 
<EOS>
Nizza
did
not
require
a
second
exhortation
,
but
quitting
the
cell
,
and
noticing
its
situation
,
swiftly
descended
the
winding
staircase
,
and
hurrying
along
the
northern
aisle
,
proceeded
to
a
small
chamber
beneath
the
tower
at
its
western
extremity
,
which
she
knew
was
occupied
by
one
of
the
vergers
.
<EOS>
Speedily
arousing
him
,
she
told
him
her
errand
,
and
implored
him
to
remain
on
the
watch
till
she
returned
with
Doctor
Hodges
.
<EOS>
The
verger
promised
compliance
;
and
,
opening
a
wicket
in
the
great
doorway
,
allowed
her
to
go
forth
.
<EOS>
A
few
seconds
brought
her
to
the
doctor
's
dwelling
,
and
though
it
was
an
hour
after
midnight
,
her
summons
was
promptly
answered
by
the
old
porter
,
who
conveyed
her
message
to
his
master
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
had
just
retired
to
rest
;
but
,
on
learning
in
whose
behalf
his
services
were
required
,
he
sprang
out
of
bed
,
and
hastily
slipped
on
his
clothes
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
,
for
half
I
am
worth
,
that
that
poor
youth
should
perish
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
take
a
great
interest
in
him
--
a
very
great
interest
.
<EOS>
He
must
not
be
neglected
.
<EOS>
How
comes
he
at
Saint
Paul
's
,
I
wonder
?
<EOS>
But
I
can
obtain
information
on
that
point
as
I
go
thither
.
<EOS>
No
time
must
be
lost
.
"
 
<EOS>
Ruminating
thus
,
he
swallowed
a
glass
of
sack
,
and
providing
himself
with
a
case
of
instruments
,
and
such
medicines
as
he
thought
he
might
require
,
he
descended
to
Nizza
.
<EOS>
On
the
way
to
the
cathedral
,
she
acquainted
him
with
what
had
befallen
Leonard
during
the
last
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
,
and
the
only
circumstance
that
she
kept
back
was
Judith
's
attempt
on
his
life
.
<EOS>
This
she
intended
to
reveal
at
a
more
fitting
opportunity
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
expressed
somewhat
emphatically
his
disapproval
of
the
conduct
of
Mr.
Bloundel
,
but
promised
to
set
all
to
rights
without
loss
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
only
difficulty
I
foresee
,
"
he
observed
,
"
is
that
the
poor
youth
is
attacked
by
the
pestilence
;
and
though
I
may
succeed
in
curing
him
,
his
master
will
probably
have
shut
up
his
house
before
I
can
accomplish
my
object
,
in
which
case
,
all
chance
of
his
union
with
Amabel
will
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
better
,
"
rejoined
Nizza
,
sharply
;
"
she
does
not
deserve
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
I
agree
with
you
,
"
returned
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
But
could
you
point
out
any
one
who
does
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
with
a
slight
but
significant
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
No
answer
was
returned
;
and
as
they
had
just
reached
the
portico
of
the
cathedral
,
they
entered
the
sacred
structure
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
ascended
the
winding
stairs
,
loud
outcries
resounded
along
the
ambulatory
,
and
echoed
by
the
vaulted
roof
of
the
nave
,
convinced
them
that
the
sufferer
was
again
in
a
state
of
frenzy
,
produced
by
fever
and
the
anguish
of
his
sore
;
and
on
reaching
the
cell
they
found
him
struggling
violently
with
Solomon
Eagle
,
who
held
him
down
by
main
force
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
in
a
fearfully
excited
state
,
truly
,
"
observed
Hodges
,
as
he
drew
near
,
"
and
must
not
be
left
for
a
moment
,
or
he
will
do
himself
a
mischief
.
<EOS>
I
must
give
him
a
draught
to
allay
the
fever
,
and
compose
his
nerves
--
for
in
this
state
<EOS>
I
dare
not
have
recourse
to
the
lancet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
he
dressed
the
tumour
;
and
pouring
the
contents
of
a
large
phial
which
he
had
brought
with
him
in
a
cup
,
he
held
it
to
the
burning
lips
of
the
apprentice
,
who
eagerly
quaffed
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
soon
apparent
that
the
dose
produced
a
salutary
effect
,
and
a
second
was
administered
.
<EOS>
Still
the
sufferer
,
though
calmer
,
continued
to
ramble
as
before
--
complained
that
his
veins
were
filled
with
molten
lead
--
entreated
them
to
plunge
him
in
a
stream
,
so
that
he
might
cool
his
intolerable
thirst
,
and
appeared
to
be
in
great
agony
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
watched
by
him
till
daybreak
,
at
which
time
he
sank
into
a
slumber
;
and
Solomon
Eagle
,
who
had
never
till
then
relinquished
his
hold
of
him
,
now
ventured
to
resign
his
post
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
was
then
about
to
depart
;
but
at
the
urgent
solicitation
of
Nizza
,
who
had
stationed
herself
at
the
door
of
the
cell
,
he
agreed
to
remain
a
little
longer
.
 
<EOS>
Two
hours
after
this
,
the
doors
of
the
cathedral
were
opened
,
and
a
large
crowd
soon
assembled
within
the
nave
,
as
on
the
preceding
day
.
<EOS>
The
tumult
of
voices
reached
the
cell
and
awakened
the
sleeper
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
be
prevented
he
started
from
his
bed
,
and
dashing
aside
the
feeble
opposition
offered
by
Nizza
and
the
doctor
,
ran
along
the
ambulatory
,
uttering
a
loud
and
fearful
cry
.
<EOS>
Finding
the
door
of
the
winding
staircase
open
,
he
darted
through
it
,
and
in
a
few
seconds
reappeared
in
the
aisle
.
<EOS>
Hearing
the
cries
,
several
persons
rushed
to
meet
him
;
but
on
beholding
his
haggard
looks
and
strange
appearance
--
he
was
merely
wrapped
in
a
blanket,--they
instantly
recoiled
.
<EOS>
Mean
-
time
,
Doctor
Hodges
,
who
had
run
to
one
of
the
arched
openings
looking
on
the
nave
,
called
out
to
them
to
secure
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
But
all
fled
at
his
approach
;
and
when
he
reached
the
door
of
the
southern
transept
,
the
verger
,
instead
of
attempting
to
stop
him
,
retreated
with
a
cry
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
As
he
passed
through
the
outlet
,
one
man
bolder
than
the
rest
caught
hold
of
him
,
and
endeavoured
to
detain
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
leaving
the
blanket
in
his
hands
,
and
without
other
covering
than
his
shirt
,
the
apprentice
dashed
across
the
churchyard
--
next
shaped
his
course
down
Saint
Bennet's
-
hill
--
then
crossed
<EOS>
Thames
-
street,--and
finally
speeding
along
another
narrow
thoroughfare
,
reached
Paul
's
Wharf
.
<EOS>
Gazing
for
a
moment
at
the
current
sweeping
past
him
--
it
was
high
-
tide,--he
plunged
head
foremost
into
it
from
the
high
embankment
,
and
on
rising
to
the
surface
,
being
a
strong
and
expert
swimmer
,
struck
out
for
the
opposite
shore
.
<EOS>
Those
who
beheld
him
were
filled
with
amazement
;
but
such
was
the
alarm
occasioned
by
his
appearance
,
that
none
ventured
to
interfere
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
crossed
more
than
a
fourth
part
of
the
stream
when
Doctor
Hodges
arrived
at
the
wharf
;
but
neither
promises
of
reward
nor
threats
could
induce
any
of
the
watermen
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
The
humane
physician
would
have
sprung
into
a
boat
,
but
feeling
he
should
be
wholly
unable
to
manage
it
,
he
most
reluctantly
abandoned
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
doubting
what
the
result
of
this
rash
attempt
would
be
,
and
yet
unable
to
tear
himself
away
,
he
lingered
on
the
wharf
till
he
saw
Leonard
reach
the
opposite
bank
,
where
an
attempt
was
made
by
a
party
of
persons
to
seize
him
.
<EOS>
But
instead
of
quietly
surrendering
himself
,
the
apprentice
instantly
leapt
into
the
river
again
,
and
began
to
swim
back
towards
the
point
whence
he
had
started
.
<EOS>
Amazed
at
what
he
saw
,
the
doctor
ordered
his
servant
,
who
by
this
time
had
joined
the
group
,
to
bring
a
blanket
,
and
descending
to
the
edge
of
the
river
,
awaited
the
swimmer
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
ten
minutes
he
had
reached
the
shore
,
and
clambering
on
the
bank
,
fell
from
exhaustion
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
violent
effort
of
nature
,
which
has
accomplished
more
than
science
or
skill
could
do
,
"
said
Hodges
,
as
he
gazed
on
the
body
,
and
saw
that
the
pestilential
tumour
had
wholly
disappeared--"he
is
completely
cured
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
throwing
the
blanket
over
him
,
he
ordered
him
to
be
conveyed
to
his
own
house
.

THE
PEST
-
HOUSE
IN
FINSBURY
FIELDS
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
word
passed
between
the
grocer
and
his
daughter
,
as
he
took
her
home
from
Saint
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
Amabel
,
in
fact
,
was
so
overpowered
by
conflicting
emotions
that
she
could
not
speak
;
while
her
father
,
who
could
not
help
reproaching
himself
for
the
harshness
he
had
displayed
towards
Leonard
Holt
,
felt
no
disposition
to
break
silence
.
<EOS>
They
found
Mrs.
Bloundel
at
the
shop
-
door
,
drowned
in
tears
,
and
almost
in
a
state
of
distraction
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
them
,
she
rushed
towards
her
daughter
,
and
straining
her
to
her
bosom
,
gave
free
vent
to
the
impulses
of
her
affection
.
<EOS>
Allowing
the
first
transports
of
joy
to
subside
,
Mr.
Bloundel
begged
,
her
to
retire
to
her
own
room
with
Amabel
,
and
not
to
leave
it
till
they
had
both
regained
their
composure
,
when
he
wished
to
have
some
serious
conversation
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
His
request
complied
with
,
the
grocer
then
retraced
his
steps
to
the
cathedral
with
the
intention
of
seeking
an
explanation
from
Leonard
,
and
,
if
he
saw
occasion
to
do
so
,
of
revoking
his
severe
mandate
.
<EOS>
But
long
before
he
reached
the
southern
transept
,
the
apprentice
had
disappeared
,
nor
could
he
learn
what
had
become
of
him
.
<EOS>
While
anxiously
pursuing
his
search
among
the
crowd
,
and
addressing
inquiries
to
all
whom
he
thought
likely
to
afford
him
information
,
he
perceived
a
man
pushing
his
way
towards
him
.
<EOS>
As
this
person
drew
near
,
he
recognised
Pillichody
,
and
would
have
got
out
of
his
way
<EOS>
had
it
been
possible
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
looking
for
your
apprentice
,
I
understand
,
Mr.
Bloundel
,
"
said
the
bully
,
raising
his
hat--"if
you
desire
,
it
<EOS>
,
I
will
lead
you
to
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
Unwilling
as
he
was
to
be
obliged
to
one
whom
he
knew
to
be
leagued
with
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
the
grocer
's
anxiety
overcame
his
scruples
,
and
,
signifying
his
acquiescence
,
Pillichody
shouldered
his
way
through
the
crowd
,
and
did
not
stop
till
they
reached
the
northern
aisle
,
where
they
were
comparatively
alone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
apprentice
is
a
fortunate
spark
,
Mr.
Bloundel
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
No
sooner
does
he
lose
one
mistress
than
he
finds
another
.
<EOS>
Tour
daughter
is
already
forgotten
,
and
he
is
at
this
moment
enjoying
a
tender
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
_
in
Bishop
Kempe
's
chapel
with
Nizza
Macascree
,
the
blind
piper
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
false
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
grocer
,
incredulously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Unbelieving
dog
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Pillichody
,
in
a
furious
tone
,
and
clapping
his
hand
upon
his
sword
<EOS>
,
"
it
is
fortunate
for
you
that
the
disparity
of
our
stations
prevents
me
from
compelling
you
to
yield
me
satisfaction
for
the
insult
you
have
offered
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
caution
you
to
keep
better
guard
upon
your
tongue
for
the
future
,
especially
when
addressing
one
who
has
earned
his
laurels
under
King
Charles
the
Martyr
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
especial
reverence
for
the
monarch
you
served
under
,
"
replied
Bloundel
;
"
but
he
would
have
blushed
to
own
such
a
follower
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
thank
my
generosity
that
I
do
not
crop
your
ears
,
base
Roundhead
,
"
rejoined
Pillichody
;
"
but
I
will
convince
you
that
I
speak
the
truth
,
and
if
you
have
any
shame
in
your
composition
,
it
will
be
summoned
to
your
cheeks
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
proceeded
to
Bishop
Kempe
's
chapel
,
the
door
of
which
was
slightly
ajar
,
and
desired
the
grocer
to
look
through
the
chink
.
<EOS>
This
occurred
at
the
precise
time
that
the
apprentice
was
seized
with
sudden
faintness
,
and
was
leaning
for
support
upon
Nizza
Macascree
's
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
how
lovingly
they
are
seated
together
,
"
observed
Pillichody
,
with
a
smile
of
triumph
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Bowers
of
Paphos
!
<EOS>
I
would
I
were
as
near
the
rich
widow
of
Watling
-
street
.
<EOS>
Will
you
speak
with
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Bloundel
,
turning
away
;
"
I
have
done
with
him
for
ever
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
greatly
deceived
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
chuckled
Pillichody
,
as
soon
as
the
grocer
was
out
of
hearing
;
"
but
not
by
your
apprentice
,
Mr.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
and
inform
Parravicin
and
Rochester
that
I
have
discovered
the
girl
.
<EOS>
The
knight
must
mind
what
he
is
about
,
or
Leonard
Holt
will
prove
too
much
for
him
.
<EOS>
Either
I
am
greatly
out
,
or
the
apprentice
is
already
master
of
Nizza
's
heart
.
"
 
<EOS>
To
return
to
Amabel
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
was
alone
with
her
mother
,
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
before
her
,
and
,
imploring
her
forgiveness
,
hastily
related
all
that
had
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
for
Leonard
Holt
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
should
have
been
duped
into
a
false
marriage
with
the
earl
,
and
my
peace
of
mind
would
have
been
for
ever
destroyed
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
I
shall
never
be
easy
till
he
is
restored
to
my
father
's
favour
.
<EOS>
To
have
done
wrong
myself
is
reprehensible
enough
;
but
that
another
should
suffer
for
my
fault
is
utterly
inexcusable
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
lament
that
your
father
should
be
deceived
,
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
"
and
I
lament
still
more
that
Leonard
Holt
should
be
so
unjustly
treated
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
we
must
act
with
the
utmost
caution
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
husband
too
well
to
doubt
for
a
moment
that
he
will
hesitate
to
fulfil
his
threat
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
dear
child
,
"
she
continued
,
"
do
not
the
repeated
proofs
you
have
received
of
this
wicked
nobleman
's
perfidy
,
and
of
Leonard
's
devotion
--
do
they
not
,
I
say
,
open
your
eyes
to
the
truth
,
and
show
you
which
of
the
two
really
loves
you
,
and
merits
your
regard
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
hide
nothing
from
you
,
mother
,
"
replied
Amabel
.
"
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
perfidy
,
in
spite
of
my
conviction
of
his
unworthiness
,
I
still
love
the
Earl
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
Nor
can
I
compel
myself
to
feel
any
regard
,
stronger
than
that
of
friendship
,
for
Leonard
Holt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
distress
me
,
sadly
,
child
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
What
will
become
of
you
!
<EOS>
I
wish
my
husband
would
shut
up
his
house
.
<EOS>
That
might
put
an
end
to
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
half
so
much
afraid
of
the
plague
as
I
am
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
But
compose
yourself
,
as
your
father
desired
,
that
when
he
sends
for
us
we
may
be
ready
to
meet
him
with
cheerfulness
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
,
however
,
did
_
not
_
send
for
them
.
<EOS>
He
remained
in
the
shop
all
day
,
except
at
meal
-
times
,
when
he
said
little
,
and
appeared
to
be
labouring
under
a
great
weight
of
anxiety
.
<EOS>
As
Amabel
took
leave
of
him
for
the
night
,
he
dismissed
her
with
coldness
;
and
though
he
bestowed
his
customary
blessing
upon
her
,
the
look
that
accompanied
it
was
not
such
as
it
used
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
things
continued
in
the
same
state
.
<EOS>
The
grocer
was
cold
and
inscrutable
,
and
his
wife
,
fearing
he
was
meditating
some
severe
course
against
Amabel
,
and
aware
of
his
inflexible
nature
,
if
a
resolution
was
once
formed
,
shook
off
her
habitual
awe
,
and
thus
addressed
him
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
you
have
not
forgiven
our
daughter
.
<EOS>
Be
not
too
hasty
in
your
judgment
.
<EOS>
However
culpable
she
may
appear
,
she
has
been
as
much
deceived
as
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
,
"
replied
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
Still
she
has
acted
with
such
indiscretion
that
I
can
never
place
confidence
in
her
again
,
and
without
confidence
affection
is
as
nought
.
<EOS>
Can
I
say
to
him
who
may
seek
her
in
marriage
,
and
whom
I
may
approve
as
a
husband,--'Take
her
!
<EOS>
she
has
never
deceived
me
,
and
will
never
deceive
you
?
'
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
She
_
has
<EOS>
_
deceived
me
,
and
will
,
therefore
,
deceive
others
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
the
precise
truth
of
the
story
of
her
abduction
(
if
such
it
was
)
by
Leonard
Holt
,
neither
<EOS>
do
I
wish
to
know
it
,
because
I
might
be
compelled
to
act
with
greater
severity
than
I
desire
towards
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
know
enough
to
satisfy
me
<EOS>
she
has
been
excessively
imprudent
,
and
has
placed
herself
voluntarily
in
situations
of
the
utmost
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
voluntarily
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
lured
into
difficulties
by
others
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
more
!
<EOS>
"
interrupted
the
grocer
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
wish
to
serve
her
,
keep
guard
upon
your
tongue
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
preparations
to
make
,
they
must
not
be
delayed
.
<EOS>
I
shall
shut
up
my
house
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Whether
Leonard
returns
or
not
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
wait
for
no
one
,
"
returned
her
husband
,
peremptorily
.
 
<EOS>
They
then
separated
,
and
Mrs.
Bloundel
hastened
to
her
daughter
to
acquaint
her
with
the
result
of
the
interview
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
,
the
grocer
,
who
began
to
feel
extremely
uneasy
about
Leonard
,
again
repaired
to
Saint
Paul
's
to
see
whether
he
could
obtain
any
tidings
of
him
,
and
learnt
,
to
his
great
dismay
,
from
one
of
the
vergers
,
that
a
young
man
,
answering
to
the
description
of
the
apprentice
,
had
been
attacked
by
the
pestilence
,
and
having
been
taken
to
the
vaults
of
Saint
Faith
's
,
had
made
his
escape
from
his
attendants
,
and
,
it
was
supposed
,
had
perished
.
<EOS>
Horror
-
stricken
by
this
intelligence
,
he
descended
to
the
subterranean
church
,
where
he
met
Judith
Malmayns
and
Chowles
,
who
confirmed
the
verger
's
statement
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
poor
young
man
,
I
am
informed
,
"
said
Chowles
,
"
threw
himself
into
the
Thames
,
and
was
picked
up
by
a
boat
,
and
afterwards
conveyed
,
in
a
dying
state
,
to
the
pest
-
house
in
Finsbury
Fields
,
where
you
will
probably
find
him
,
if
he
is
still
alive
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
heard
no
more
.
<EOS>
Quitting
the
cathedral
,
he
hastened
to
Finsbury
Fields
,
and
sought
out
the
building
to
which
he
had
been
directed
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
solitary
farm
-
house
,
of
considerable
size
,
surrounded
by
an
extensive
garden
,
and
had
only
been
recently
converted
to
its
present
melancholy
use
.
<EOS>
Near
it
was
a
barn
,
also
fitted
up
with
beds
for
the
sick
.
<EOS>
On
approaching
the
pest
-
house
,
Mr.
Bloundel
was
greatly
struck
with
the
contrast
presented
by
its
exterior
to
the
misery
he
knew
to
be
reigning
within
.
<EOS>
Its
situation
was
charming,--in
the
midst
,
as
has
just
been
stated
,
of
a
large
and
,
until
recently
,
well
-
cultivated
garden
,
and
seen
under
the
influence
of
a
bright
and
genial
May
day
,
the
whole
place
looked
the
picture
of
healthfulness
and
comfort
.
<EOS>
But
a
closer
view
speedily
dispelled
the
illusion
,
and
showed
that
it
was
the
abode
of
disease
and
death
.
<EOS>
Horrid
sounds
saluted
the
ears
;
ghastly
figures
met
the
eyes
;
and
the
fragrance
of
the
flowers
was
overpowered
by
the
tainted
and
noisome
atmosphere
issuing
from
the
open
doors
and
windows
.
<EOS>
The
grocer
had
scarcely
entered
the
gate
when
he
was
arrested
by
an
appalling
shriek
,
followed
by
a
succession
of
cries
so
horrifying
that
he
felt
half
disposed
to
fly
.
<EOS>
But
mustering
up
his
resolution
,
and
breathing
at
a
phial
of
vinegar
,
he
advanced
towards
the
principal
door
,
which
stood
wide
open
,
and
called
to
one
of
the
assistants
.
<EOS>
The
man
,
however
,
was
too
busy
to
attend
to
him
,
and
while
waiting
his
leisure
,
he
saw
no
fewer
than
three
corpses
carried
out
to
an
outbuilding
in
the
yard
,
where
they
were
left
till
they
could
be
taken
away
at
night
for
interment
.
 
<EOS>
Sickened
by
the
sight
,
and
blaming
himself
for
entering
near
this
contagious
spot
,
Mr.
Bloundel
was
about
to
depart
,
when
a
young
chirurgeon
stepped
out
to
him
,
and
,
in
reply
to
his
inquiries
after
Leonard
,
said
:
"
Twelve
persons
were
brought
in
here
last
night
,
and
five
this
morning
,
but
I
do
not
remember
any
of
their
names
.
<EOS>
You
can
go
through
the
rooms
and
search
for
your
apprentice
,
if
you
think
proper
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
hesitated
,
but
his
humanity
overcame
his
apprehension
,
and
murmuring
a
prayer
that
he
might
be
preserved
from
infection
,
he
followed
his
conductor
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
Prepared
as
he
was
for
a
dreadful
spectacle
,
the
reality
far
exceeded
his
anticipations
.
<EOS>
Along
both
sides
of
a
large
room
,
occupying
nearly
the
whole
of
the
ground
-
floor
,
were
rows
of
pallets
,
on
which
were
laid
the
sick
,
many
of
whom
were
tied
down
to
their
couches
.
<EOS>
Almost
all
seemed
in
a
hopeless
state
,
and
the
cadaverous
hue
of
their
countenances
proclaimed
that
death
was
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
Though
the
doors
and
windows
were
open
,
and
the
room
was
filled
with
vapours
and
exhalations
,
arising
from
pans
of
coal
and
plates
of
hot
iron
,
on
which
drugs
were
burning
,
nothing
could
remove
the
putrid
,
and
pestilential
smell
that
pervaded
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
The
thick
vapour
settled
on
the
panes
of
the
windows
,
and
on
the
roof
,
and
fell
to
the
ground
in
heavy
drops
.
<EOS>
Marching
quickly
past
each
bed
,
the
grocer
noted
the
features
of
its
unfortunate
occupant
;
but
though
there
were
many
young
men
,
Leonard
was
not
among
the
number
.
<EOS>
His
conductor
then
led
him
to
an
upper
room
,
where
he
found
the
chirurgeons
dressing
the
sores
of
their
patients
,
most
of
whom
uttered
loud
shrieks
while
under
their
hands
.
<EOS>
Here
an
incident
occurred
which
deeply
affected
the
grocer
.
<EOS>
A
poor
young
woman
,
who
had
been
brought
to
the
pest
-
house
with
her
child
on
the
previous
evening
,
had
just
expired
,
and
the
infant
,
unable
to
obtain
its
customary
nourishment
,
uttered
the
most
piteous
cries
.
<EOS>
It
was
instantly
removed
by
a
nurse
and
proper
food
given
it
;
but
Mr.
Bloundel
was
informed
that
the
plague
-
tokens
had
already
appeared
,
and
that
it
would
not
probably
live
over
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
,
"
said
the
young
chirurgeon
,
"
it
will
be
buried
with
its
mother
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
it
happened
.
 
<EOS>
The
grocer
turned
away
to
hide
his
emotion
,
and
endeavoured
through
his
blinded
gaze
to
discover
Leonard
,
but
,
as
will
be
anticipated
,
without
success
.
<EOS>
Stunned
by
the
cries
and
groans
that
pierced
his
ears
,
and
almost
stifled
by
the
pestilential
effluvia
,
he
rushed
out
of
the
house
,
and
gladly
accepted
a
glass
of
sack
offered
him
by
his
conductor
,
which
removed
the
dreadful
nausea
that
affected
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
now
remember
that
the
two
last
persons
brought
here
were
taken
to
the
barn
,
"
observed
the
chirurgeon
;
"
I
will
go
with
you
thither
,
if
you
think
proper
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
grocer
assented
,
and
the
chirurgeon
crossed
the
yard
,
and
opened
the
door
of
the
barn
,
on
the
floor
of
which
upwards
of
twenty
beds
were
laid
.
<EOS>
Passing
between
them
,
Mr.
Bloundel
narrowly
scrutinized
every
countenance
;
but
,
to
his
great
relief
,
recognised
no
one
.
<EOS>
One
couch
alone
remained
to
be
examined
.
<EOS>
The
poor
sufferer
within
it
had
drawn
the
coverings
over
his
face
,
and
when
they
were
removed
he
was
found
quite
dead
!
<EOS>
He
was
a
young
man
;
and
the
agony
he
had
endured
in
the
last
struggle
was
shown
by
his
collapsed
frame
and
distorted
features
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
,
however
,
Leonard
;
and
,
so
far
satisfied
,
though
greatly
shocked
,
Mr.
Bloundel
hurried
out
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
Heaven
<EOS>
he
is
not
here
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
to
his
conductor
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
seen
the
dead
bodies
in
the
outhouse
,
"
returned
the
other
;
"
it
is
possible
his
may
be
among
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
not
,
"
rejoined
the
grocer
,
shuddering
;
"
but
as
I
have
gone
thus
far
,
I
will
not
leave
my
errand
unaccomplished
.
<EOS>
Suffer
me
to
look
at
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
chirurgeon
then
led
the
way
to
a
spacious
outbuilding
,
once
used
for
cattle
,
in
the
midst
of
which
stood
a
large
frame
supporting
six
bodies
,
covered
only
with
a
sheet
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
could
not
overcome
his
repugnance
to
enter
this
shed
;
but
the
chirurgeon
,
who
appeared
habituated
to
such
scenes
,
and
to
regard
them
lightly
,
threw
off
the
sheet
,
and
raised
the
corpses
,
one
by
one
,
that
he
might
the
better
view
them
.
<EOS>
One
peculiarity
Mr.
Bloundel
noticed
;
<EOS>
namely
,
that
the
limbs
of
these
unfortunate
victims
of
the
pestilence
did
not
stiffen
,
as
would
have
been
the
case
if
they
had
died
of
any
other
disorder
;
while
the
blotches
that
appeared
on
the
livid
flesh
made
them
objects
almost
too
horrible
to
look
upon
.
<EOS>
In
many
cases
the
features
were
frightfully
distorted
--
the
tongues
of
the
poor
wretches
swollen
and
protruding
--
the
hands
clenched
,
and
the
toes
bent
towards
the
soles
of
the
feet
.
<EOS>
Everything
denoted
the
dreadful
pangs
that
must
have
attended
dissolution
.
 
<EOS>
Greatly
relieved
to
find
that
the
whole
of
this
ghastly
group
were
strangers
to
him
,
Mr.
Bloundel
thanked
the
chirurgeon
,
and
departed
.
<EOS>
Convinced
that
he
had
been
deceived
by
the
coffin
-
maker
,
he
now
began
to
hope
that
the
whole
story
was
false
;
but
he
determined
not
to
rest
till
he
had
thoroughly
investigated
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Before
doing
so
,
however
,
he
thought
it
advisable
to
return
home
,
and
accordingly
shaped
his
course
toward
Cripplegate
,
and
,
passing
through
the
postern
,
stopped
at
an
apothecary
's
shop
,
and
got
his
apparel
fumigated
and
sprinkled
with
spirits
of
hartshorn
and
sulphur
.
 
<EOS>
On
reaching
Wood
-
street
,
he
noticed
,
with
some
uneasiness
,
a
number
of
persons
gathered
together
before
his
dwelling
.
<EOS>
His
fears
were
speedily
relieved
by
finding
that
the
assemblage
was
collected
by
a
preacher
,
who
was
pronouncing
an
exhortation
to
them
in
tones
almost
as
loud
and
emphatic
as
those
of
Solomon
Eagle
.
<EOS>
The
preacher
's
appearance
was
very
remarkable
,
and
attracted
the
attention
of
the
grocer
,
who
joined
the
crowd
to
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
could
be
judged
,
he
was
a
middle
-
aged
man
,
with
black
hair
floating
over
his
shoulders
,
earnest
features
,
and
a
grey
eye
of
extraordinary
brilliancy
.
<EOS>
His
figure
was
slight
and
erect
,
and
his
gestures
as
impassioned
as
his
looks
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
with
great
rapidity
;
and
his
eloquence
,
combined
with
his
fervent
manner
and
expression
,
completely
entranced
his
audience
.
<EOS>
He
was
habited
in
a
cassock
and
bands
,
and
had
taken
off
his
cap
,
which
was
held
by
an
attendant
,
who
stood
near
the
stool
on
which
he
was
mounted
.
<EOS>
The
latter
differed
materially
from
his
master
.
<EOS>
His
closely
-
cropped
hair
,
demure
looks
,
sugar
-
loaf
hat
,
and
suit
of
rusty
sable
,
seemed
to
proclaim
him
a
Puritan
;
but
his
twinkling
eye
--
for
he
had
but
one
,
and
wore
a
black
patch
over
the
orifice
--
his
inflamed
cheeks
,
and
mulberry
nose
contradicted
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
preacher
distinguished
Mr.
Bloundel
,
he
addressed
his
discourse
to
him
;
and
,
alluding
to
his
religious
habits
and
general
excellence
of
character
,
held
him
up
as
an
example
to
others
.
<EOS>
The
grocer
would
fain
have
retreated
;
but
the
preacher
besought
him
to
stay
,
and
was
proceeding
in
the
same
strain
,
when
a
sudden
interruption
took
place
.
<EOS>
A
slight
disturbance
occurring
amid
the
crowd
,
the
attendant
attempted
to
check
it
,
and
in
doing
so
received
a
sound
buffet
on
the
ears
.
<EOS>
In
endeavouring
to
return
the
blow
,
he
struck
another
party
,
who
instantly
retaliated
,
and
a
general
affray
commenced
--
<EOS>
some
taking
one
side
,
some
the
other
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
confusion
three
persons
forced
their
way
towards
the
preacher
,
knocked
him
from
his
stool
,
and
,
assailing
him
with
the
most
opprobrious
epithets
,
dealt
him
several
seemingly
severe
blows
,
and
would
have
further
maltreated
him
,
if
Mr.
Bloundel
had
not
interposed
,
and
,
pushing
aside
his
assailants
,
gave
him
his
hand
,
and
led
him
into
his
dwelling
,
the
door
of
which
he
closed
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
the
crowd
dispersing
,
the
preacher
's
companion
entered
the
shop
in
search
of
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
sustained
no
injury
during
this
tumult
,
reverend
and
dear
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
with
great
apparent
solicitude
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
much
hurt
,
"
replied
the
preacher
;
"
but
I
have
received
a
blow
on
the
head
,
which
has
stunned
me
.
<EOS>
The
faintness
will
go
off
presently
.
<EOS>
You
were
the
cause
of
this
disturbance
,
Bambolio
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
,
Doctor
Maplebury
?
"
replied
Bambolio
.
<EOS>
"
I
endeavoured
to
stop
it
.
<EOS>
But
your
reverence
looks
extremely
ill
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
sir
,
"
he
added
to
Mr.
Bloundel
,
"
after
the
high
character
my
master
gave
you
in
his
discourse
,
and
which
I
am
persuaded
you
deserve
,
you
will
extend
your
hospitality
towards
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Readily
,
"
replied
the
grocer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
Blaize
,
assist
the
reverend
gentleman
within
,
and
bid
your
mistress
come
down
stairs
immediately
.
"
 
<EOS>
Doctor
Maplebury
was
then
conveyed
between
the
porter
and
Bambolio
into
the
inner
room
,
where
he
sank
into
a
chair
in
a
complete
state
of
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
Mrs.
Bloundel
made
her
appearance
with
Amabel
.
<EOS>
The
latter
no
sooner
beheld
the
preacher
,
than
she
started
and
trembled
so
violently
,
that
she
could
scarcely
support
herself
;
but
her
mother
,
who
only
saw
a
fainting
man
,
flew
to
his
assistance
,
and
called
to
Patience
to
bring
restoratives
.
<EOS>
These
applied
,
Doctor
Maplebury
was
soon
able
to
rouse
himself
sufficiently
to
gaze
round
the
room
,
and
fix
his
eyes
on
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
our
old
friends
are
here
again
,
"
said
Patience
in
a
low
tone
to
Blaize
,
as
they
left
the
room
together
.
 
<EOS>
"
Old
friends
!
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
?
"
rejoined
the
porter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
Earl
of
Rochester
and
Major
Pillichody
,
"
replied
Patience
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
them
at
a
glance
,
and
so
did
Mistress
Amabel
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
had
n't
discovered
them
,
the
major
would
soon
have
let
me
into
the
secret
by
the
way
in
which
he
squeezed
my
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Blaize
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
and
acquaint
my
master
with
the
trick
directly
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
so
,
"
replied
Patience
,
"
and
the
house
will
be
shut
up
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Our
only
chance
of
averting
that
calamity
is
in
the
earl
.
"
  
<EOS>
XI
.
 
<EOS>
HOW
THE
GROCER
SHUT
UP
HIS
HOUSE
.
 
<EOS>
Placed
in
a
warm
bed
,
and
carefully
tended
by
the
humane
physician
,
Leonard
Holt
slept
tranquilly
for
some
hours
,
and
when
he
awoke
,
though
so
weak
as
scarcely
to
be
able
to
lift
an
arm
,
he
was
free
from
all
ailment
.
<EOS>
Feeling
ravenously
hungry
,
he
made
known
his
wants
;
and
,
provisions
being
set
before
him
,
he
was
allowed
to
eat
and
drink
in
moderation
.
<EOS>
Greatly
revived
by
the
meal
,
he
arose
and
attired
himself
in
habiliments
provided
for
him
by
Hodges
,
who
,
finding
him
fully
equal
to
conversation
,
questioned
him
as
to
all
that
had
occurred
prior
to
his
seizure
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
acted
nobly
,
"
observed
the
doctor
,
at
the
close
of
his
recital
;
"
and
if
Amabel
had
a
spark
of
generosity
in
her
composition
,
she
would
worthily
requite
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
expect
it
.
<EOS>
How
different
is
her
conduct
from
that
of
the
piper
's
pretty
daughter
.
<EOS>
The
latter
really
loves
you
;
and
I
would
advise
you
as
a
friend
to
turn
your
thoughts
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
will
make
you
happy
:
whereas
the
indulgence
of
your
present
hopeless
passion
--
for
hopeless
it
is
--
can
only
lead
to
wretchedness
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Would
I
could
follow
your
advice
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Leonard
;
"
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
Amabel
does
not
love
the
Earl
of
Rochester
more
blindly
,
more
constantly
,
than
I
love
her
;
and
I
could
as
soon
change
my
nature
as
transfer
my
affection
to
another
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
truly
sorry
for
it
,
"
rejoined
Hodges
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
sympathy
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
still
desire
to
return
to
your
master
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Unquestionably
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
banished
the
house
,
I
shall
wander
round
it
night
and
day
like
a
ghost
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
accompany
you
there
this
evening
,
"
rejoined
Hodges
,
"
and
I
trust
I
shall
be
able
to
arrange
matters
without
compromising
Amabel
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
forward
your
suit
more
efficiently
;
but
I
see
no
chance
of
it
,
and
,
to
deal
plainly
with
you
,
I
do
not
think
a
marriage
with
her
would
be
for
your
happiness
.
<EOS>
The
brilliant
qualities
of
your
noble
rival
at
present
so
dazzle
her
eyes
,
that
your
own
solid
worth
is
completely
overlooked
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
well
if
her
father
can
preserve
her
from
ruin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
earl
shall
die
by
my
hand
rather
than
he
shall
succeed
in
his
infamous
purpose
,
"
cried
Leonard
,
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
more
of
this
!
"
exclaimed
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
would
have
me
take
an
interest
in
you
,
you
will
never
give
utterance
to
such
a
sentiment
again
.
<EOS>
Amabel
has
another
guardian
,
more
powerful
even
than
her
father
--
the
plague
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
the
earl
,
who
has
a
sufficient
value
for
his
own
safety
,
will
fly
the
city
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
the
pestilence
will
number
him
among
its
victims
,
"
observed
Leonard
,
in
a
sombre
tone
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
the
old
porter
entered
the
room
,
and
informed
his
master
that
the
piper
's
daughter
was
below
,
and
had
called
to
inquire
after
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
Hodges
desired
she
might
be
shown
upstairs
,
and
the
next
moment
Nizza
was
ushered
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
On
beholding
the
improved
appearance
of
Leonard
,
she
could
not
repress
an
exclamation
of
delight
,
while
a
deep
blush
suffused
her
cheeks
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
surprised
to
find
him
quite
well
,
"
observed
Hodges
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
you
may
approach
him
with
safety
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
fear
of
contagion
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Having
satisfied
myself
on
that
point
,
I
will
take
my
leave
,
"
rejoined
Nizza
,
in
some
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
till
you
have
allowed
me
to
return
my
thanks
<EOS>
,
I
trust
,
"
said
Leonard
,
advancing
towards
her
,
and
taking
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
owe
my
life
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
pay
the
debt
by
devoting
it
to
her
,
"
rejoined
Hodges
.
"
<EOS>
Excuse
me
for
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
I
have
business
to
attend
to
,
but
will
be
back
again
directly
.
"
 
<EOS>
Left
alone
together
,
the
young
couple
felt
so
much
embarrassment
that
for
some
minutes
neither
could
utter
a
word
.
<EOS>
At
length
Nizza
,
who
had
suffered
her
hand
to
remain
in
that
of
Leonard
,
gently
withdrew
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Circumstances
have
given
me
a
claim
to
your
confidence
<EOS>
,
"
she
faltered
,
"
and
you
will
not
misconstrue
my
motive
,
when
I
ask
you
whether
you
still
retain
the
same
affection
as
formerly
for
Amabel
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Unfortunately
for
myself
,
I
do
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
unfortunately
for
me
too
,
"
sighed
Nizza
.
"
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
says
he
can
restore
you
to
your
master
's
favour
.
<EOS>
You
will
therefore
return
home
,
and
we
shall
meet
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
these
precarious
times
,
those
who
part
,
though
even
for
a
few
days
,
can
feel
no
certainty
of
meeting
again
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
hope
we
shall
be
more
fortunate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
mistake
me
,
"
replied
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
Henceforth
I
shall
sedulously
avoid
you
.
<EOS>
Till
I
saw
you
,
I
was
happy
,
and
indifferent
to
all
else
,
my
affections
being
centred
in
my
father
and
in
my
dog
.
<EOS>
Now
I
am
restless
and
miserable
.
<EOS>
My
former
pursuits
are
abandoned
,
and
I
think
only
of
you
.
<EOS>
Despise
me
if
you
will
after
this
frank
avowal
.
<EOS>
But
believe
that
I
would
not
have
made
it
if
I
had
not
resolved
to
see
you
no
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Despise
you
!
"
echoed
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
no
!
<EOS>
I
shall
ever
feel
the
deepest
gratitude
towards
you
;
but
perhaps
it
is
better
we
should
meet
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
yet
you
throw
yourself
in
the
way
of
Amabel
,
"
cried
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
resolution
to
fly
from
the
danger
which
you
counsel
me
to
shun
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
true
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
"
but
she
is
beset
by
temptations
from
which
I
hope
to
preserve
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
excuse
will
not
avail
me
,
"
returned
Nizza
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
live
without
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
said
enough
--
more
than
enough
,
"
she
added
,
correcting
herself
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
now
bid
you
farewell
--
for
ever
.
<EOS>
May
you
be
happy
with
Amabel
,
and
may
she
love
you
as
I
love
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
As
she
said
this
she
would
have
rushed
out
of
the
room
,
if
she
had
not
been
stopped
by
Doctor
Hodges
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whither
so
fast
?
<EOS>
"
he
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
let
me
go
--
let
me
go
,
I
implore
of
you
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
bursting
into
an
agony
of
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
till
you
have
composed
yourself
,
"
rejoined
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
<EOS>
But
I
need
not
ask
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
Leonard
can
be
insensible
to
charms
like
yours
,
coupled
with
such
devotion
.
<EOS>
Everything
seems
to
be
at
cross
purposes
,
and
it
requires
some
one
more
skilled
in
the
affairs
of
the
heart
than
an
old
bachelor
like
myself
to
set
them
right
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
few
questions
of
importance
to
ask
you
before
you
depart
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
partly
by
entreaty
,
partly
by
compulsion
,
he
made
her
take
a
chair
;
and
as
soon
as
she
was
sufficiently
composed
to
answer
him
,
questioned
her
as
to
what
she
knew
relating
to
Judith
Malmayns
and
Chowles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Quatremain
,
the
minor
canon
,
has
died
of
the
plague
in
one
of
the
vaults
of
Saint
Faith
's
,
"
he
observed
;
"
and
I
more
than
suspect
,
from
the
appearance
of
the
body
,
has
not
met
with
fair
play
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
suspicion
is
well
founded
,
sir
,
"
replied
Nizza
.
"
<EOS>
Solomon
Eagle
told
me
that
the
unfortunate
man
's
end
was
hastened
by
the
plague
-
nurse
.
<EOS>
Nor
is
this
her
sole
crime
.
<EOS>
She
was
hired
to
make
away
with
Leonard
Holt
in
the
same
manner
,
and
would
have
accomplished
her
purpose
but
for
the
intervention
of
Solomon
Eagle
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Neither
she
nor
her
partner
in
guilt
,
the
coffin
-
maker
,
shall
escape
justice
this
time
,
"
replied
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
instantly
cause
her
to
be
arrested
,
and
I
trust
she
will
expiate
her
offences
at
Tyburn
.
<EOS>
But
to
change
the
subject
.
<EOS>
I
am
sincerely
interested
about
you
,
Nizza
,
and
I
wish
I
could
make
Leonard
as
sensible
of
your
merits
as
I
am
myself
.
<EOS>
I
still
hope
a
change
will
take
place
in
his
feelings
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
heart
tells
me
the
contrary
,
"
replied
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
hope
for
either
of
us
.
<EOS>
Farewell
,
Leonard
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
Hodges
quitted
the
apprentice
,
and
going
before
a
magistrate
,
detailed
all
that
had
come
to
his
knowledge
concerning
the
criminal
practices
of
Judith
Malmayns
and
Chowles
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
day
the
accused
parties
were
arrested
,
and
,
after
a
long
examination
,
conveyed
to
Newgate
.
<EOS>
Solomon
Eagle
could
not
be
found
,
neither
could
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
that
Mr.
Quatremain
's
residence
had
been
entered
on
that
very
morning
,
and
the
box
of
treasure
discovered
in
Saint
Faith
's
abstracted
.
<EOS>
But
though
the
strongest
suspicion
of
the
robbery
attached
to
Chowles
and
Judith
,
it
could
not
be
brought
home
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
now
proceed
to
Wood
-
street
,
and
ascertain
what
took
place
there
.
<EOS>
Refreshments
were
placed
before
the
supposed
Doctor
Maplebury
by
the
grocer
,
while
his
attendant
was
sent
to
the
kitchen
,
and
directions
given
to
Blaize
to
take
every
care
of
him
;
old
Josyna
was
occupied
about
her
own
concerns
;
and
Pillichody
,
perceiving
from
the
porter
's
manner
that
his
disguise
was
detected
,
laid
aside
concealment
altogether
,
and
endeavoured
to
win
the
other
over
to
his
patron
's
interests
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
this
marriage
takes
place
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
am
authorized
by
my
noble
friend
to
state
that
he
will
appoint
you
his
steward
with
a
large
salary
,
and
that
will
be
a
very
different
situation
from
the
one
you
hold
at
present
.
<EOS>
A
nobleman
's
steward
!
<EOS>
Think
of
that
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
a
retinue
of
servants
under
your
control
,
and
will
live
quite
as
well
as
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
some
scruples
,
"
hesitated
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
"
Scruples
!
<EOS>
pshaw
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
have
no
hesitation
in
benefiting
yourself
.
<EOS>
If
you
remain
here
,
the
house
will
be
shut
up
,
and
you
will
be
kept
a
close
prisoner
for
months
in
the
very
heart
of
an
infected
city
,
and
I
dare
say
will
be
buried
in
yonder
cellar
;
whereas
,
if
you
go
with
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
you
will
dwell
in
a
magnificent
country
mansion
--
a
palace
,
I
ought
to
call
it
--
enjoy
every
luxury
,
and
remain
there
till
the
plague
is
over
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
last
reason
decides
me
,
"
replied
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
suppose
his
lordship
will
provide
himself
with
a
medicine
chest
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
already
got
one
as
large
as
this
table
,
"
said
Pillichody
,
"
and
you
shall
have
the
key
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
"
exclaimed
Blaise
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
yours
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
what
am
I
to
be
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Patience
,
who
had
listened
to
the
foregoing
conversation
with
a
smile
at
Blaize
's
credulity
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
,
sweetheart
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
care
of
you
.
<EOS>
You
shall
be
my
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
cried
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
admit
that
.
<EOS>
Patience
and
I
are
engaged
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Since
you
are
promoted
to
such
an
important
situation
,
you
can
make
a
better
match
,
"
observed
Patience
.
<EOS>
"
I
release
you
from
the
engagement
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
choose
to
be
released
,
"
returned
Blaize
;
"
I
will
marry
you
on
the
same
day
that
the
earl
weds
Amabel
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
will
be
to
-
night
,
or
to
-
morrow
at
the
latest
,
"
said
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
Consent
,
sweetheart
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
whisper
to
Patience
;
"
if
we
can
once
get
you
and
your
pretty
mistress
out
of
the
house
,
we
will
leave
this
simpleton
fool
in
the
lurch
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
will
never
consent
to
such
a
thing
,
"
returned
Patience
,
in
the
same
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
you
are
saying
?
"
inquired
Blaize
,
suspiciously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Major
Pillichody
says
he
will
marry
me
,
if
you
wo
n't
,
"
returned
Patience
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
told
you
I
will
,
"
rejoined
Blaize
.
"
<EOS>
But
he
must
not
continue
his
attentions
.
<EOS>
I
feel
I
shall
be
very
jealous
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
returned
Patience
,
bursting
into
a
loud
laugh
,
"
for
that
proves
you
love
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
observed
Pillichody
,
"
I
wo
n't
interfere
with
a
friend
;
and
as
there
is
no
knowing
what
may
occur
,
it
will
be
as
well
to
prepare
accordingly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
fell
to
work
upon
the
provisions
loading
the
board
,
and
ate
and
drank
as
if
determined
to
lay
in
a
stock
for
the
next
two
days
.
 
<EOS>
Meantime
the
earl
made
rapid
progress
in
the
good
opinion
both
of
Mr.
Bloundel
and
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Adapting
his
discourse
precisely
to
their
views
,
and
exerting
his
matchless
conversational
powers
to
their
full
extent
,
he
so
charmed
them
that
they
thought
they
could
listen
to
him
for
ever
.
<EOS>
While
thus
engaged
,
he
contrived
ever
and
anon
to
steal
a
glance
at
Amabel
,
and
on
these
occasions
,
his
eyes
were
quite
as
eloquent
and
intelligible
as
his
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
Among
other
topics
interesting
to
the
grocer
,
the
persecution
to
which
his
daughter
had
been
recently
subjected
was
brought
forward
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
could
not
reprobate
the
earl
's
conduct
more
strongly
than
his
guest
did
;
and
he
assailed
himself
with
such
virulence
that
,
in
spite
of
her
uneasiness
,
Amabel
could
not
repress
a
smile
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
so
accommodated
himself
to
the
grocer
's
opinion
,
and
so
won
upon
his
regard
,
that
the
latter
offered
him
an
asylum
in
his
house
during
the
continuance
of
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
This
was
eagerly
accepted
,
and
the
earl
,
hazarding
a
look
at
Amabel
at
the
moment
,
perceived
her
change
colour
and
become
greatly
agitated
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bloundel
also
noticed
her
confusion
,
but
attributing
it
to
any
other
than
the
right
cause
,
begged
her
,
in
a
low
tone
,
to
control
herself
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
opportunity
for
which
the
earl
had
been
secretly
sighing
occurred
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
called
his
wife
out
of
the
room
for
a
moment
,
and
as
their
eldest
son
,
Stephen
,
was
in
the
shop
,
and
the
two
other
children
upstairs
,
Amabel
was
left
alone
with
her
lover
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
no
sooner
closed
than
he
sprang
towards
her
and
threw
himself
at
her
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
avail
myself
of
your
father
's
offer
,
sweetheart
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
remain
here
with
you
--
the
happiest
of
prisoners
--
or
will
you
once
more
accompany
me
?
<EOS>
This
time
,
our
marriage
shall
not
be
interrupted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
,
my
lord
,
"
she
replied
,
gravely
;
"
but
it
will
be
a
mock
ceremonial
,
like
the
last
.
<EOS>
Do
not
attempt
to
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
fully
aware
of
your
intentions
,
and
after
the
awful
fate
of
the
wretched
instrument
of
your
purposed
criminality
,
you
will
not
readily
get
another
person
to
tempt
in
like
manner
the
vengeance
of
Heaven
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
a
severe
struggle
with
myself
.
<EOS>
But
at
length
I
have
triumphed
over
my
irresolution
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
disguise
from
you
that
I
love
you
<EOS>
still,--and
must
ever
,
I
fear
,
continue
to
love
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
be
yours
on
the
terms
you
propose
.
<EOS>
Neither
will
I
leave
this
house
with
you
,
nor
suffer
you
to
remain
in
it
,
in
any
other
than
your
proper
character
.
<EOS>
On
my
father
's
return
I
will
disclose
all
to
him
.
<EOS>
If
your
designs
are
honourable
,
I
am
sure
he
will
no
longer
oppose
my
union
with
you
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
we
part
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
prudent
,
sweet
girl
,
I
entreat
of
you
,
"
cried
the
earl
imploringly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
indiscretion
will
ruin
all
.
<EOS>
There
are
a
thousand
reasons
why
your
father
should
not
be
consulted
on
the
matter
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
are
none
that
weigh
with
me
,
"
she
interrupted
,
decidedly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
bewildered
--
beside
myself,--but
,
thank
Heaven
,
I
have
recovered
before
it
is
too
late
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
beside
yourself
at
this
moment
,
"
cried
Rochester
,
unable
to
control
his
anger
and
mortification
,
"
and
will
bitterly
repent
your
folly
.
<EOS>
Neither
your
supplications
nor
my
rank
will
have
any
weight
with
your
father
,
prejudiced
as
he
is
against
me
.
<EOS>
Fly
with
me
,
and
I
swear
to
make
you
mine
,
without
a
moment
's
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
Will
not
my
plighted
word
content
you
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
lord
,
you
have
broken
it
already
,
"
returned
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
shall
know
the
truth
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
dark
shade
passed
over
Rochester
's
countenance
,
and
a
singular
and
most
forbidding
expression
,
which
Amabel
had
once
before
noticed
,
took
possession
of
it
.
<EOS>
His
love
for
her
seemed
changed
to
hate
,
and
she
tremblingly
averted
her
gaze
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
the
door
opened
,
and
the
grocer
and
his
wife
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
former
started
,
on
seeing
Amabel
and
the
supposed
preacher
in
such
close
propinquity
,
and
a
painful
suspicion
of
the
truth
crossed
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
,
however
,
kept
long
in
suspense
.
<EOS>
Throwing
off
his
wig
,
and
letting
his
own
fair
ringlets
fall
over
his
shoulders
,
the
earl
tore
open
his
cassock
,
and
disclosed
his
ordinary
rich
attire
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
his
face
underwent
an
equally
striking
change,--each
feature
resuming
its
original
expression
;
and
the
grocer
,
though
he
witnessed
the
whole
transformation
,
could
scarcely
believe
that
the
same
individual
he
had
recently
beheld
stood
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
now
know
who
I
am
,
Mr.
Bloundel
,
and
what
brought
me
hither
,
"
said
Rochester
,
with
a
haughty
salutation
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
grocer
,
"
and
I
give
you
full
credit
for
your
daring
and
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
After
the
manner
in
which
I
have
been
imposed
upon
myself
,
I
can
make
allowance
for
others
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
turned
to
Amabel
,
and
said
,
in
a
severe
tone
,
"
You
are
no
longer
my
daughter
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Father
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
rushing
towards
him
and
throwing
herself
at
his
feet
,
"
do
not
cast
me
off
for
ever
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
now
to
blame
.
<EOS>
It
is
owing
to
my
determination
to
disclose
all
to
you
that
the
earl
has
thus
revealed
himself
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
deceived
you
further
--
might
have
fled
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Forgive
her
!
<EOS>
oh
,
forgive
her
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs.
Bloundel--"or
,
if
any
ill
happens
to
her
,
you
will
be
answerable
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
this
the
truth
,
my
lord
?
"
asked
the
grocer
.
 
<EOS>
Rochester
bowed
stiffly
in
acquiescence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
again
my
child
,
"
said
Bloundel
,
raising
her
,
and
pressing
her
to
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
"
What
are
your
intentions
towards
her
?
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
addressing
the
earl
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
may
be
readily
surmised
,
"
replied
Rochester
,
with
a
scornful
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
we
d
her
,
if
I
agree
to
the
union
,
"
asked
Bloundel
,
trembling
with
concentrated
rage
.
 
<EOS>
Amabel
looked
at
her
lover
as
if
her
life
hung
on
his
answer
.
 
<EOS>
Rochester
affected
not
to
hear
the
question
,
but
,
as
it
was
repeated
still
more
peremptorily
,
he
repeated
carelessly,--"I
will
consider
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Deceived
!
<EOS>
deceived
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Amabel
,
falling
on
her
mother
's
neck
,
and
bursting
into
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
outrage
shall
not
pass
unpunished
,
"
cried
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
And
before
the
earl
could
draw
his
sword
or
offer
any
resistance
,
he
threw
himself
upon
him
,
and
hurling
him
to
the
ground
,
set
his
foot
upon
his
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
kill
him
,
"
shrieked
Amabel
,
terrified
by
the
stern
expression
of
her
father
's
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
about
to
do
?
"
gasped
Rochester
,
struggling
ineffectually
to
get
free
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bid
Stephen
bring
a
cord
,
"
cried
the
grocer
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
going
to
hang
him
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
as
I
bid
you
,
"
rejoined
her
husband
,
"
and
lose
no
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
she
was
about
to
leave
the
room
,
the
door
opened
,
and
Doctor
Hodges
entered
,
followed
by
Leonard
and
Stephen
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mercy
on
us
!
<EOS>
what
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
former
,
in
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
just
arrived
in
time
to
prevent
mischief
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
interfere
between
them
.
<EOS>
My
husband
will
attend
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Arise
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Mr.
Bloundel
,
removing
his
foot
from
the
prostrate
nobleman
;
"
you
are
sufficiently
punished
by
being
found
in
this
disgraceful
condition
.
<EOS>
Remember
that
your
life
has
been
at
my
disposal
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
liberated
,
Rochester
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
regarding
the
group
with
a
menacing
and
disdainful
look
,
walked
up
to
Amabel
,
and
saying
to
her
,
"
You
shall
yet
be
mine
,
"
strode
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
then
marched
along
the
passage
,
and
called
to
Pillichody
,
who
instantly
answered
the
summons
.
<EOS>
Accompanied
by
Hodges
,
the
grocer
followed
them
to
the
shop
,
where
the
bully
not
departing
so
quickly
as
he
desired
,
and
refusing
to
be
more
expeditious
,
he
kicked
him
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
and
the
door
fastened
,
he
tarried
only
till
he
had
received
all
needful
explanations
from
the
friendly
physician
,
and
then
returning
to
the
inner
room
,
warmly
greeted
Leonard
,
and
congratulated
him
on
his
extraordinary
recovery
from
the
plague
.
 
<EOS>
Happiness
was
thus
once
more
restored
to
every
member
of
the
grocer
's
family
,
except
Amabel
,
who
still
continued
downcast
and
dejected
,
and
entreated
permission
to
retire
to
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
A
cheerful
evening
was
then
passed
by
the
others
,
and
the
doctor
did
not
offer
to
take
his
departure
till
the
clock
struck
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
last
night
I
shall
spend
here
for
some
months
,
"
he
said
;
"
<EOS>
perhaps
the
last
I
shall
ever
spend
here
,
and
I
have
stayed
longer
than
I
intended
,
but
I
did
not
like
to
abridge
my
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
shaking
hands
cordially
with
the
whole
party
,
he
added
in
an
under
tone
,
as
he
took
leave
of
Leonard
,
"
Do
not
forget
Nizza
Macascree
.
"
 
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
the
grocer
nailed
up
the
shutters
,
and
locked
and
barred
the
doors
of
his
house
.

BOOK
THE
THIRD

<EOS>
JUNE
,
1665
.
  
<EOS>
I.
 
THE
IMPRISONED
FAMILY
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
few
days
of
their
confinement
were
passed
by
the
grocer
's
family
in
a
very
uncomfortable
manner
.
<EOS>
No
one
,
except
Mr.
Bloundel
,
appeared
reconciled
to
the
plan
,
and
even
he
found
it
more
difficult
of
accomplishment
that
he
had
anticipated
.
<EOS>
The
darkness
of
the
rooms
,
and
the
want
of
ventilation
caused
by
the
closed
windows
and
barred
doors
,
gave
the
house
the
air
of
a
prison
,
and
occasioned
a
sense
of
oppression
almost
intolerable
.
<EOS>
Blaize
declared
it
was
"
worse
than
being
in
Newgate
,
and
that
he
must
take
an
additional
rufus
to
set
right
his
digestion
;
"
while
Patience
affirmed
"
that
it
was
like
being
buried
alive
,
and
that
she
would
not
stand
it
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
paid
no
attention
to
their
complaints
,
but
addressed
himself
seriously
to
the
remedy
.
<EOS>
Insisting
upon
the
utmost
attention
being
paid
to
cleanliness
,
he
had
an
abundant
supply
of
water
drawn
,
with
which
the
floors
of
every
room
and
passage
were
washed
down
daily
.
<EOS>
By
such
means
the
house
was
kept
cool
and
wholesome
;
and
its
inmates
,
becoming
habituated
to
the
gloom
,
in
a
great
degree
recovered
their
cheerfulness
.
 
<EOS>
The
daily
routine
of
the
establishment
was
as
follows
.
<EOS>
The
grocer
arose
at
dawn
,
and
proceeded
to
call
up
the
whole
of
his
family
.
<EOS>
They
then
assembled
in
a
large
room
on
the
second
story
,
where
he
offered
up
thanks
that
they
had
been
spared
during
the
night
,
and
prayed
for
their
preservation
during
the
day
.
<EOS>
He
next
assigned
a
task
to
each
,
and
took
care
to
see
it
afterwards
duly
fulfilled
;
<EOS>
well
knowing
that
constant
employment
was
the
best
way
to
check
repining
and
promote
contentment
.
<EOS>
Heretofore
the
servants
had
always
taken
their
meals
in
the
kitchen
,
but
now
they
always
sat
down
to
table
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
no
distinction
at
this
season
,
"
he
said
;
"
all
shall
fare
as
I
fare
,
and
enjoy
the
same
comforts
as
myself
.
<EOS>
And
I
trust
that
my
dwelling
may
be
as
sure
a
refuge
amid
this
pestilential
storm
as
the
ark
of
the
patriarch
proved
when
Heaven
's
vengeance
was
called
forth
in
the
mighty
flood
.
"
 
<EOS>
Their
devotions
ended
,
the
whole
party
repaired
to
one
of
the
lower
rooms
,
where
a
plentiful
breakfast
was
provided
,
and
of
which
they
all
partook
.
<EOS>
The
business
of
the
day
then
began
,
and
,
as
has
just
been
observed
,
no
one
was
suffered
to
remain
idle
.
<EOS>
The
younger
children
were
allowed
to
play
and
exercise
themselves
as
much
as
they
chose
in
the
garret
,
and
Blaize
and
Patience
were
occasionally
invited
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
A
certain
portion
of
the
evening
was
also
devoted
to
harmless
recreation
and
amusements
.
<EOS>
The
result
may
be
anticipated
.
<EOS>
No
one
suffered
in
health
,
while
all
improved
in
spirits
.
<EOS>
Prayers
,
as
usual
,
concluded
the
day
,
and
the
family
retired
to
rest
at
an
early
hour
.
 
<EOS>
This
system
of
things
may
appear
sufficiently
monotonous
,
but
it
was
precisely
adapted
to
the
exigencies
of
the
case
,
and
produced
a
most
salutary
effect
.
<EOS>
Regular
duties
and
regular
employments
being
imposed
upon
each
,
and
their
constant
recurrence
,
so
far
from
being
irksome
,
soon
became
agreeable
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
the
whole
family
seemed
to
grow
indifferent
to
the
external
world
--
to
live
only
for
each
other
,
and
to
think
only
of
each
other
--
and
to
Leonard
Holt
,
indeed
,
that
house
was
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
Those
walls
contained
everything
dear
to
him
,
and
he
would
have
been
quite
content
never
to
leave
them
if
Amabel
had
been
always
near
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
attempt
to
renew
his
suit
--
seldom
or
never
exchanging
a
word
with
her
,
and
might
have
been
supposed
to
have
become
wholly
indifferent
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
so
.
<EOS>
His
heart
was
consumed
by
the
same
flame
as
before
.
<EOS>
No
longer
,
however
,
a
prey
to
jealousy
--
no
longer
apprehensive
of
the
earl
<EOS>
--
he
felt
so
happy
,
in
comparison
with
what
he
had
been
,
that
he
almost
prayed
that
the
term
of
their
imprisonment
might
be
prolonged
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
the
image
of
Nizza
Macascree
would
intrude
upon
him
,
and
he
thought
,
with
a
feeling
akin
to
remorse
,
of
what
she
might
suffer
--
for
he
was
too
well
acquainted
with
the
pangs
of
unrequited
love
not
to
sympathise
deeply
with
her
.
<EOS>
As
to
Amabel
,
she
addressed
herself
assiduously
to
the
tasks
enjoined
by
her
father
,
and
allowed
her
mind
to
dwell
as
little
as
possible
on
the
past
,
but
employed
all
her
spare
time
in
devotional
exercises
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
remembered
that
the
grocer
had
reserved
a
communication
with
the
street
,
by
means
of
a
shutter
opening
from
a
small
room
in
the
upper
story
.
<EOS>
Hither
he
would
now
frequently
repair
,
and
though
he
did
not
as
yet
think
it
necessary
to
have
recourse
to
all
the
precautionary
measures
he
intended
eventually
to
adopt
--
such
as
flashing
a
pistol
when
he
looked
forth
--
yet
he
never
opened
the
shutter
without
holding
a
phial
of
vinegar
,
or
a
handkerchief
wetted
with
the
same
liquid
,
to
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
Before
closing
his
house
he
had
hired
a
porter
,
who
occupied
the
hutch
at
his
door
,
and
held
himself
in
readiness
to
execute
any
commission
,
or
perform
any
service
that
might
be
required
.
<EOS>
Fresh
vegetables
,
poultry
,
eggs
,
butter
,
and
milk
,
were
brought
by
a
higgler
from
the
country
,
and
raised
by
means
of
a
basket
or
a
can
attached
to
the
pulley
.
<EOS>
Butcher
's
meat
was
fetched
him
from
Newgate
-
market
by
the
porter
.
<EOS>
This
man
,
whose
name
was
Ralph
Dallison
,
had
been
formerly
in
the
employ
of
the
grocer
,
who
,
knowing
his
character
,
could
place
entire
reliance
on
him
.
<EOS>
Dallison
reported
the
progress
of
the
pestilence
daily
,
and
acquainted
him
with
the
increasing
amount
of
the
bills
of
mortality
.
<EOS>
Several
houses
,
he
said
,
were
infected
in
Cheapside
,
and
two
in
Wood
-
street
,
one
of
which
was
but
a
short
distance
from
the
grocer
's
habitation
.
<EOS>
A
watchman
was
stationed
at
the
door
,
and
the
red
cross
marked
upon
it
,
and
on
the
following
night
the
grocer
heard
the
sound
of
the
doleful
bell
announcing
the
approach
of
the
pest
-
cart
.
 
<EOS>
The
weather
still
continued
as
serene
and
beautiful
as
ever
,
but
no
refreshing
showers
fell
--
no
soft
and
healthful
breezes
blew
--
and
it
was
now
found
to
be
true
,
what
had
been
prognosticated
--
viz
,
that
with
the
heats
of
summer
the
plague
would
fearfully
increase
.
<EOS>
The
grocer
was
not
incommoded
in
the
same
degree
as
his
neighbours
.
<EOS>
By
excluding
the
light
he
excluded
the
heat
,
and
the
care
which
he
took
to
have
his
house
washed
down
kept
it
cool
.
<EOS>
The
middle
of
June
had
arrived
,
and
such
dismal
accounts
were
now
brought
him
of
the
havoc
occasioned
by
the
scourge
,
that
he
would
no
longer
take
in
fresh
provisions
,
but
began
to
open
his
stores
.
<EOS>
Dallison
told
him
that
the
alarm
was
worse
than
ever
--
that
vast
numbers
were
endeavouring
to
leave
the
city
,
but
no
one
could
now
do
so
without
a
certificate
,
which
was
never
granted
if
the
slightest
suspicion
was
attached
to
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
things
go
on
in
this
way
,
"
said
the
porter
,
"
London
will
soon
be
deserted
.
<EOS>
No
business
is
conducted
,
as
it
used
to
be
,
and
everybody
is
viewed
with
distrust
.
<EOS>
The
preachers
,
who
ought
to
be
the
last
to
quit
,
have
left
their
churches
,
and
the
Lord
's
day
is
no
longer
observed
.
<EOS>
Many
medical
men
even
have
departed
,
declaring
their
services
are
no
longer
of
any
avail
.
<EOS>
All
public
amusements
are
suspended
,
and
the
taverns
are
only
open
to
the
profane
and
dissolute
,
who
deride
God
's
judgments
,
and
declare
they
have
no
fear
.
<EOS>
Robberies
,
murders
,
and
other
crimes
,
have
greatly
increased
,
and
the
most
dreadful
deeds
are
now
committed
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
You
have
done
wisely
,
sir
,
in
protecting
yourself
against
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
reason
to
be
thankful
that
I
have
done
so
,
"
replied
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
And
he
closed
his
shutter
to
meditate
on
what
he
had
just
heard
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
was
abundant
food
for
reflection
.
<EOS>
Around
him
lay
a
great
and
populous
city
,
hemmed
in
,
as
by
a
fire
,
by
an
exterminating
plague
,
that
spared
neither
age
,
condition
,
nor
sex
.
<EOS>
No
man
could
tell
what
the
end
of
all
this
would
be
--
neither
at
what
point
the
wrath
of
the
offended
Deity
would
stop
--
nor
whether
He
would
relent
,
till
He
had
utterly
destroyed
a
people
who
so
contemned
his
word
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
daring
to
hope
for
leniency
,
and
filled
with
a
dreadful
foreboding
of
what
would
ensue
,
the
grocer
addressed
a
long
and
fervent
supplication
to
Heaven
,
imploring
a
mitigation
of
its
wrath
.
 
<EOS>
On
joining
his
family
,
his
grave
manner
and
silence
showed
how
powerfully
he
had
been
affected
.
<EOS>
No
one
questioned
him
as
to
what
had
occurred
,
but
all
understood
he
had
received
some
distressing
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
Amid
his
anxiety
one
circumstance
gave
him
unalloyed
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
change
wrought
in
Amabel
's
character
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
stated
that
she
had
become
extremely
devout
,
and
passed
the
whole
of
the
time
not
appointed
for
other
occupations
,
in
the
study
of
the
Scriptures
,
or
in
prayer
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
was
extremely
sedate
,
and
her
conversation
assumed
a
tone
that
gave
her
parents
,
and
especially
her
father
,
inexpressible
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bloundel
would
have
been
equally
delighted
with
the
change
,
if
it
had
tended
to
forward
her
own
favourite
scheme
of
a
union
with
Leonard
;
but
as
this
was
not
the
case
,
though
she
rejoiced
in
the
improvement
,
she
still
was
not
entirely
satisfied
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
noting
also
,
that
her
daughter
had
become
pale
and
thin
,
and
though
she
uttered
no
complaint
,
Mrs.
Bloundel
began
to
fear
her
health
was
declining
.
<EOS>
Leonard
Holt
looked
on
in
wonder
and
admiration
,
and
if
possible
his
love
increased
,
though
his
hopes
diminished
;
for
though
Amabel
was
kinder
to
him
than
before
,
her
kindness
seemed
the
result
rather
of
a
sense
of
duty
than
regard
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
one
occasion
they
were
left
alone
together
,
and
instead
of
quitting
the
room
,
as
she
had
been
accustomed
,
Amabel
called
to
Leonard
,
who
was
about
to
depart
,
and
requested
him
to
stay
.
<EOS>
The
apprentice
instantly
obeyed
;
the
colour
forsook
his
cheek
,
and
his
heart
beat
violently
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
desire
to
speak
with
me
,
Amabel
,
"
he
said:--"Ha
!
<EOS>
you
have
relented?--Is
there
any
hope
for
me
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
no
,
"
she
replied
;
"
and
it
is
on
that
very
point
I
have
now
detained
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
,
I
am
sure
,
rejoice
to
learn
that
I
have
at
length
fully
regained
my
peace
of
mind
,
and
have
become
sensible
of
the
weakness
of
which
I
have
been
guilty
--
of
the
folly
,
worse
than
folly
,
I
have
committed
.
<EOS>
My
feelings
are
now
under
proper
restraint
,
and
viewing
myself
with
other
eyes
,
I
see
how
culpable
I
have
been
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Leonard
,
if
you
knew
the
effort
it
has
been
to
conquer
the
fatal
passion
that
consumed
me
,
if
I
were
to
tell
you
of
the
pangs
it
has
cost
me
,
of
the
tears
I
have
shed
,
of
<EOS>
the
heart
-
quakes
endured
,
you
would
pity
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
indeed
,
pity
you
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
"
for
my
own
sufferings
<EOS>
have
been
equally
severe
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
not
been
as
successful
as
you
in
subduing
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
you
have
not
pursued
the
right
means
,
Leonard
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
Fix
your
thoughts
on
high
;
build
your
hopes
of
happiness
on
Heaven
;
strengthen
your
faith
;
and
you
will
soon
find
the
victory
easy
.
<EOS>
A
short
time
ago
I
thought
only
of
worldly
pleasures
,
and
was
ensnared
by
vanity
and
admiration
,
enchained
to
one
whom
I
knew
to
be
worthless
,
and
who
pursued
me
only
to
destroy
me
.
<EOS>
Religion
has
preserved
me
from
the
snare
,
and
religion
will
restore
you
to
happiness
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
devote
yourself
to
Heaven
,
not
lightly
,
but
with
your
whole
soul
.
<EOS>
You
must
forget
me
--
forget
yourself
--
forget
all
but
the
grand
object
.
<EOS>
And
this
is
a
season
of
all
others
,
when
it
is
most
needful
to
lead
a
life
of
piety
,
to
look
upon
yourself
as
dead
to
this
world
,
and
to
be
ever
prepared
for
that
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
shudder
to
think
what
might
have
been
my
portion
<EOS>
had
I
perished
in
my
sin
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yours
is
a
most
happy
frame
of
mind
,
"
returned
Leonard
,
"
and
I
would
I
had
a
chance
of
attaining
the
same
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
have
conquered
your
love
for
the
<EOS>
earl,--if
your
heart
is
disengaged
,
why
deny
me
a
hope
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
heart
is
_
not
_
disengaged
,
Leonard
,
"
she
replied
;
"
it
is
engrossed
by
Heaven
.
<EOS>
While
the
plague
is
raging
around
us
thus
--
while
thousands
are
daily
carried
off
by
that
devouring
scourge
--
and
while
every
hour
,
every
moment
,
may
be
our
last
,
our
thoughts
ought
always
to
be
fixed
above
.
<EOS>
I
have
ceased
to
love
the
earl
,
but
I
can
never
love
another
,
and
therefore
it
would
be
unjust
to
you
,
to
whom
I
owe
so
much
,
to
hold
out
hopes
that
never
can
be
realized
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
alas
!
"
cried
Leonard
,
unable
to
control
his
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Compose
yourself
,
dear
Leonard
,
"
she
cried
,
greatly
moved
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
I
could
comply
with
your
wishes
.
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
give
you
,
"
she
added
,
in
a
tone
so
thrilling
,
that
it
froze
the
blood
in
his
veins--"a
breaking
,
perhaps
a
broken
heart
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Gracious
heaven
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Leonard
,
becoming
as
pale
as
death
;
"
is
it
come
to
this
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Again
,
I
beg
you
to
compose
yourself
,
"
she
rejoined
,
<EOS>
calmly--"and
<EOS>
I
entreat
you
not
to
let
what
I
have
told
you
pass
your
lips
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
alarm
my
father
,
or
my
dear
and
anxious
mother
,
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
And
there
may
be
no
reason
for
alarm
.
<EOS>
Promise
me
,
therefore
,
you
will
be
silent
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
reluctantly
gave
the
required
pledge
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
unwittingly
been
the
cause
of
much
affliction
to
you
,
"
pursued
Amabel--"and
<EOS>
would
gladly
see
you
happy
,
and
there
is
one
person
,
I
think
,
who
would
make
you
so
--
<EOS>
I
mean
Nizza
Macascree
.
<EOS>
From
what
she
said
to
me
when
we
were
alone
together
in
the
vaults
of
Saint
Faith
's
,
I
am
sure
she
is
sincerely
attached
to
you
.
<EOS>
Could
you
not
requite
her
love
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
change
in
affection
like
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pursue
the
course
I
have
advised
,
"
replied
Amabel
,
"
and
you
will
find
all
your
troubles
vanish
.
<EOS>
Farewell
!
<EOS>
I
depend
upon
your
silence
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
quitted
the
room
,
leaving
Leonard
in
a
state
of
indescribable
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
Faithful
,
however
,
to
his
promise
,
he
made
no
mention
of
his
uneasiness
to
the
grocer
or
his
wife
,
but
indulged
his
grief
in
secret
.
<EOS>
Ignorant
of
what
was
passing
,
Mr.
Bloundel
,
who
was
still
not
without
apprehension
of
some
further
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
earl
,
sent
Dallison
to
make
inquiries
after
him
,
and
learnt
that
he
was
at
Whitehall
,
but
that
the
court
had
fixed
to
remove
to
Hampton
Court
at
the
end
of
June
.
<EOS>
The
porter
also
informed
him
that
the
city
was
emptying
fast
--
that
the
Lord
Mayor
's
residence
was
literally
besieged
with
applications
for
bills
of
health
--
that
officers
were
stationed
at
the
gates
--
and
that
,
besides
these
,
barriers
and
turnpikes
were
erected
on
all
the
main
roads
,
at
which
the
certificates
were
required
to
be
exhibited
--
and
that
such
persons
as
escaped
without
them
were
driven
back
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
neighbouring
villages
,
who
refused
to
supply
them
with
necessaries
;
and
as
they
could
not
return
home
,
many
had
perished
of
want
,
or
perhaps
of
the
pestilence
,
in
the
open
fields
.
<EOS>
Horses
and
coaches
,
he
added
,
were
not
to
be
procured
,
except
at
exorbitant
prices
;
and
thousands
had
departed
on
foot
,
locking
up
their
houses
,
and
leaving
their
effects
behind
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
consequence
of
this
,
"
added
Dallison
,
"
several
houses
have
been
broken
open
;
and
though
the
watch
had
been
trebled
,
still
they
can
not
be
in
all
places
at
once
;
and
strong
as
the
force
is
,
it
is
not
adequate
to
the
present
emergency
.
<EOS>
Bands
of
robbers
stalk
the
streets
at
night
,
taking
vehicles
with
them
,
built
to
resemble
pest
-
carts
,
and
beating
off
the
watch
,
they
break
open
the
houses
,
and
carry
off
any
goods
they
please
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
intelligence
greatly
alarmed
the
grocer
,
and
he
began
to
fear
his
plans
would
be
defeated
in
an
unexpected
manner
.
<EOS>
He
engaged
Dallison
to
procure
another
trusty
companion
to
take
his
place
at
night
,
and
furnished
him
with
money
to
purchase
arms
.
<EOS>
He
no
longer
slept
as
tranquilly
as
before
,
but
frequently
repaired
to
his
place
of
observation
to
see
that
the
watchman
was
at
his
post
,
and
that
all
was
secure
.
<EOS>
For
the
last
few
days
,
he
had
remarked
with
some
uneasiness
that
a
youth
frequently
passed
the
house
and
gazed
at
the
barred
windows
,
and
he
at
first
imagined
he
might
be
leagued
with
the
nocturnal
marauders
he
had
heard
of
;
but
the
prepossessing
appearance
of
the
stripling
,
who
could
not
be
more
than
sixteen
,
and
who
was
singularly
slightly
made
,
soon
dispelled
the
idea
.
<EOS>
Still
,
as
he
constantly
appeared
at
the
same
spot
,
the
grocer
began
to
have
a
new
apprehension
,
and
to
suspect
he
was
an
emissary
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
and
he
sent
Dallison
to
inquire
his
business
.
<EOS>
The
youth
returned
an
evasive
answer
,
and
withdrew
;
but
the
next
day
he
was
there
again
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
,
Mr.
Bloundel
pointed
him
out
to
Leonard
Holt
,
and
asked
him
if
he
had
seen
him
before
.
<EOS>
The
youth
's
back
being
towards
them
,
the
apprentice
unhesitatingly
answered
in
the
negative
,
but
as
the
subject
of
investigation
turned
the
next
moment
,
and
looked
up
,
revealing
features
of
feminine
delicacy
and
beauty
,
set
off
by
long
flowing
jet
-
black
ringlets
,
Leonard
started
,
and
coloured
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
mistaken
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
_
have
_
seen
him
before
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
he
one
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
's
pages
?
"
asked
Mr.
Bloundel
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
"
and
you
need
not
be
uneasy
about
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
he
intends
no
harm
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
satisfied
,
the
grocer
thought
no
more
about
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
then
arranged
with
Leonard
that
he
should
visit
the
window
at
certain
hours
on
alternate
nights
with
himself
,
and
appointed
the
following
night
as
that
on
which
the
apprentice
's
duties
should
commence
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
same
night
,
however
,
an
alarming
incident
occurred
,
which
kept
the
grocer
and
his
apprentice
for
a
long
time
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
The
family
had
just
retired
to
rest
when
the
report
of
fire
-
arms
was
heard
close
to
the
street
door
,
and
Mr.
Bloundel
hastily
calling
up
Leonard
,
they
repaired
to
the
room
overlooking
the
street
,
and
found
that
a
desperate
struggle
was
going
on
below
.
<EOS>
The
moon
being
overclouded
,
and
the
lantern
extinguished
,
it
was
too
dark
to
discern
the
figures
of
the
combatants
,
and
in
a
few
seconds
all
became
silent
,
except
the
groans
of
a
wounded
man
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
then
called
out
to
know
what
was
the
matter
,
and
ascertained
from
the
sufferer
,
who
proved
to
be
his
own
watchman
,
that
the
adjoining
house
,
being
infected
,
had
been
shut
up
by
the
authorities
;
and
its
owner
,
unable
to
bear
the
restraint
,
had
burst
open
the
door
,
shot
the
watchman
stationed
at
it
,
and
firing
another
pistol
at
the
poor
wretch
who
was
making
the
statement
,
because
he
endeavoured
to
oppose
his
flight
,
had
subsequently
attacked
him
with
his
sword
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
grief
to
Mr.
Bloundel
not
to
be
able
to
aid
the
unfortunate
watchman
,
and
he
had
almost
determined
to
hazard
a
descent
by
the
pulley
,
when
a
musical
voice
was
heard
below
,
and
the
grocer
soon
understood
that
the
youth
,
about
whom
his
curiosity
had
been
excited
,
was
raising
the
sufferer
,
and
endeavouring
to
stanch
his
wounds
.
<EOS>
Finding
this
impossible
,
however
,
at
Mr.
Bloundel
's
request
,
he
went
in
search
of
assistance
,
and
presently
afterwards
returned
with
a
posse
of
men
,
bearing
halberds
and
lanterns
,
who
carried
off
the
wounded
man
,
and
afterwards
started
in
pursuit
of
the
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
then
entered
into
conversation
with
the
youth
,
who
informed
him
that
his
name
was
Flitcroft
,
that
he
was
without
a
home
,
all
his
relations
having
died
of
the
plague
,
and
that
he
was
anxious
to
serve
as
a
watchman
in
place
of
the
poor
wretch
who
had
just
been
removed
.
<EOS>
Leonard
remonstrated
against
this
arrangement
,
but
Mr.
Bloundel
was
so
much
pleased
with
Flitcroft
's
conduct
that
he
would
listen
to
no
objection
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
provisions
were
lowered
down
in
a
basket
to
the
poor
youth
,
and
he
stationed
himself
in
the
hutch
.
<EOS>
Nothing
material
occurred
during
the
day
.
<EOS>
Flitcroft
resigned
his
post
to
Dallison
,
but
returned
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
At
midnight
,
Leonard
took
his
turn
to
watch
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
bright
moonlight
night
,
but
though
he
occasionally
looked
out
into
the
street
,
and
perceived
Flitcroft
below
,
he
gave
no
intimation
of
his
presence
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
,
however
,
he
was
alarmed
by
a
loud
cry
,
and
opening
the
shutter
,
perceived
the
youth
struggling
with
two
persons
,
whom
he
recognised
as
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
and
Pillichody
.
 
<EOS>
He
shouted
to
them
to
release
their
captive
,
but
they
laughed
at
his
vociferations
,
and
in
spite
of
his
resistance
dragged
the
youth
away
.
<EOS>
Maddened
at
the
sight
,
Leonard
lowered
the
rope
as
quickly
as
he
could
with
the
intention
of
descending
by
it
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
Flitcroft
turned
an
agonized
look
behind
him
,
and
perceiving
what
had
been
done
,
broke
suddenly
from
his
captors
,
and
before
he
could
be
prevented
,
sprang
into
the
basket
,
and
laid
hold
of
the
rope
.
<EOS>
Leonard
,
who
had
seen
the
movement
,
and
divined
its
object
,
drew
up
the
pulley
with
the
quickness
of
thought
;
and
so
expeditiously
was
the
whole
accomplished
,
<EOS>
that
ere
the
knight
and
his
companion
reached
the
spot
<EOS>
,
Flitcroft
was
above
their
heads
,
and
the
next
moment
was
pulled
through
the
window
,
and
in
safety
by
the
side
of
Leonard
.

HOW
FIRES
WERE
LIGHTED
IN
THE
STREETS
.
 
<EOS>
Nizza
Macascree
,
for
it
is
useless
to
affect
further
mystery
,
as
soon
as
she
could
find
utterance
,
murmured
her
thanks
to
the
apprentice
,
whose
satisfaction
at
her
deliverance
was
greatly
diminished
by
his
fears
lest
his
master
should
disapprove
of
what
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
Seeing
his
uneasiness
,
and
guessing
the
cause
,
Nizza
hastened
to
relieve
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
reproach
myself
bitterly
for
having
placed
you
in
this
situation
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
but
I
could
not
help
it
,
and
will
free
you
from
my
presence
the
moment
I
can
do
so
with
safety
.
<EOS>
When
I
bade
you
farewell
,
I
meant
it
to
be
for
ever
,
and
persuaded
myself
I
could
adhere
to
my
resolution
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
deceived
.
<EOS>
You
would
pity
me
,
were
I
to
tell
you
the
anguish
I
endured
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
accompany
my
poor
father
in
his
rambles
;
and
if
I
went
forth
at
all
,
my
steps
involuntarily
led
me
to
Wood
-
street
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
I
resolved
to
disguise
myself
,
and
borrowed
this
suit
from
a
Jew
clothesman
,
who
has
a
stall
in
Saint
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
Thus
equipped
,
I
paced
backwards
and
forwards
before
the
house
,
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
a
glimpse
of
you
,
and
fortune
has
favoured
me
more
than
I
expected
,
though
it
has
led
to
this
unhappy
result
.
<EOS>
Heaven
only
knows
what
will
become
of
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
bursting
into
tears
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
that
the
pestilence
would
select
me
as
one
of
its
victims
.
<EOS>
But
,
like
your
own
sex
,
it
shuns
all
those
who
court
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
neither
advise
you
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
in
sombre
tone
,
"
nor
help
you
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
as
the
sounds
of
violent
blows
were
heard
against
the
door
<EOS>
below--"your
persecutors
are
trying
to
break
into
the
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
Rushing
to
the
window
,
and
gazing
downwards
,
he
perceived
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
and
Pillichody
battering
against
the
shop
door
,
and
endeavouring
to
burst
it
open
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
however
,
so
stoutly
barricaded
,
that
it
resisted
all
their
efforts
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
to
be
done
?
"
cried
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
noise
will
certainly
alarm
my
master
,
and
you
will
be
discovered
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heed
me
not
,
"
rejoined
Nizza
,
distractedly
,
"
you
shall
not
run
any
risk
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
Let
me
down
the
pulley
.
<EOS>
Deliver
me
to
them
.
<EOS>
Anything
is
better
than
that
you
should
suffer
by
my
indiscretion
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
"
Mr.
Bloundel
shall
know
all
.
<EOS>
His
love
for
his
own
daughter
will
make
him
feel
for
you
.
<EOS>
But
come
what
will
,
I
will
not
abandon
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
a
timid
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
,
and
a
voice
without
exclaimed
,
in
accents
of
the
utmost
trepidation
,
"
Are
you
there
,
Leonard?--Robbers
are
breaking
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
We
shall
all
be
murdered
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
Blaize
,
"
returned
Leonard
,
opening
the
door
and
admitting
the
porter--"you
may
be
of
some
assistance
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
what
way
?
"
demanded
Blaize
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
who
's
this
?
<EOS>
"
he
added
,
perceiving
Nizza--"what
<EOS>
is
this
page
doing
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
not
concern
yourself
about
him
but
attend
to
me
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
about
to
drive
away
those
persons
from
the
door
.
<EOS>
You
must
lower
me
down
in
the
basket
attached
to
the
pulley
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
will
you
dare
to
engage
them
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Blaize
,
peeping
out
at
the
shutter
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
armed
.
<EOS>
As
I
live
,
one
is
Major
Pillichody
,
the
rascal
who
dared
to
make
love
to
Patience
.
<EOS>
I
have
half
a
mind
to
go
down
with
you
,
and
give
him
a
sound
drubbing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
encounter
this
danger
for
me
,
"
interposed
Nizza
,
endeavouring
to
stay
Leonard
,
who
,
having
thrust
a
sword
into
his
girdle
<EOS>
,
was
about
to
pass
through
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
hinder
me
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
,
breaking
from
her
.
"
<EOS>
Take
hold
of
the
rope
,
Blaize
,
and
mind
it
does
not
run
down
too
quickly
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
got
into
the
basket
,
and
as
the
porter
carefully
obeyed
his
instructions
,
he
reached
the
ground
in
safety
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
him
,
Pillichody
bolted
across
the
street
,
and
flourishing
his
sword
,
and
uttering
tremendous
imprecations
,
held
himself
in
readiness
to
beat
an
immediate
retreat
.
<EOS>
Not
so
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
Instantly
assailing
the
apprentice
,
he
slightly
wounded
him
in
the
arm
.
<EOS>
Seeing
how
matters
stood
,
and
that
victory
was
pretty
certain
to
declare
itself
for
his
patron
,
Pillichody
returned
,
and
,
attacking
the
apprentice
,
by
their
combined
efforts
,
he
was
speedily
disarmed
.
<EOS>
Pillichody
would
have
passed
his
sword
through
his
body
,
but
the
knight
stayed
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
fool
has
placed
himself
in
our
power
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
he
shall
pay
for
his
temerity
;
nevertheless
,
I
will
spare
his
life
provided
he
assist
us
to
get
into
the
house
,
or
will
deliver
up
Nizza
Macascree
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
neither
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
Parravicin
raised
his
sword
,
and
was
about
to
strike
,
when
,
at
the
moment
,
the
basket
was
again
quickly
lowered
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
It
bore
Nizza
Macascree
,
who
,
rushing
between
them
,
arrested
the
stroke
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
why
have
you
done
this
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Leonard
,
in
a
tone
of
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
why
,
"
rejoined
Parravicin
,
triumphantly
;
"
because
she
saw
you
were
unable
to
defend
her
,
and
,
like
a
true
woman
,
surrendered
herself
to
the
victor
.
<EOS>
Take
care
of
him
,
Pillichody
,
while
I
secure
the
girl
.
<EOS>
Spit
him
,
if
he
attempts
to
stir
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
twining
his
arms
round
Nizza
,
notwithstanding
her
shrieks
and
resistance
,
he
bore
her
away
.
<EOS>
Infuriated
by
the
sight
,
Leonard
Holt
threw
himself
upon
Pillichody
,
and
a
desperate
struggle
took
place
between
them
,
which
terminated
this
time
successfully
for
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
Wresting
his
long
rapier
from
the
bully
,
Leonard
rushed
after
Parravicin
,
and
reached
the
end
of
Wood
-
street
,
just
in
time
to
see
him
spring
into
a
coach
,
and
drive
off
with
his
prize
.
<EOS>
Speeding
after
them
along
Blowbladder
-
street
,
and
Middle
-
row
,
as
Newgate
-
street
was
then
termed
,
the
apprentice
shouted
to
the
coachman
to
stop
,
but
no
attention
being
paid
to
his
vociferations
,
and
finding
pursuit
unavailing
,
he
came
to
a
halt
.
<EOS>
He
then
more
slowly
retraced
his
steps
,
and
on
arriving
at
the
grocer
's
residence
,
found
the
basket
drawn
up
.
<EOS>
Almost
afraid
to
call
out
,
he
at
length
mustered
courage
enough
to
shout
to
Blaize
to
lower
it
,
and
was
answered
by
Mr.
Bloundel
,
who
,
putting
his
head
through
the
window
,
demanded
in
a
stern
tone
why
he
had
left
the
house
?
 
<EOS>
Leonard
briefly
explained
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
deeply
regret
your
imprudence
,
"
replied
his
master
;
"
because
I
can
now
no
more
admit
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
fixed
determination
,
as
you
well
know
,
not
to
suffer
any
member
of
my
family
who
may
quit
my
house
,
to
enter
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
attempt
to
remonstrate
with
you
,
sir
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
All
I
pray
of
you
is
to
allow
me
to
occupy
this
hutch
,
and
to
act
as
your
porter
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Willingly
,
"
rejoined
Mr.
Bloundel
;
"
and
as
you
have
had
the
plague
,
you
will
run
no
risk
of
infection
.
<EOS>
You
shall
know
all
that
passes
within
doors
;
and
I
only
lament
that
you
should
have
banished
yourself
from
the
asylum
which
I
hoped
to
afford
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
After
some
further
conversation
between
them
,
a
bundle
was
lowered
by
the
grocer
,
containing
a
change
of
clothes
and
a
couple
of
blankets
.
<EOS>
On
receiving
these
,
Leonard
retired
to
the
hutch
,
and
tying
a
handkerchief
round
his
wounded
arm
,
wrapped
himself
in
a
night
trail
,
and
stretching
himself
on
the
ground
,
in
spite
of
his
anxiety
,
soon
sank
asleep
.
<EOS>
He
awoke
about
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
with
a
painful
consciousness
of
what
had
taken
place
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
It
was
just
beginning
to
grow
light
,
and
he
walked
across
the
street
to
gaze
at
the
house
from
which
he
was
exiled
.
<EOS>
Its
melancholy
,
uninhabited
look
did
not
serve
to
cheer
him
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
totally
altered
since
he
knew
it
first
.
<EOS>
The
sign
,
which
then
invited
the
passers
-
by
to
enter
the
shop
and
deal
with
its
honest
owner
,
now
appeared
no
longer
significant
,
unless
--
and
it
will
be
remembered
it
was
the
Noah
's
Ark
<EOS>
--
it
could
be
supposed
to
have
reference
to
those
shut
up
within
.
<EOS>
The
apprentice
looked
at
the
habitation
with
misgiving
,
and
,
instead
of
regarding
it
as
a
sanctuary
from
the
pestilence
,
could
not
help
picturing
it
as
a
living
tomb
.
<EOS>
The
last
conversation
he
had
had
with
Amabel
also
arose
forcibly
to
his
recollection
,
and
the
little
likelihood
there
appeared
of
seeing
her
again
gave
him
acute
agony
.
<EOS>
Oppressed
by
this
painful
idea
,
and
unable
to
exclude
from
his
thoughts
the
unhappy
situation
of
Nizza
Macascree
,
he
bent
his
steps
,
scarcely
knowing
whither
he
was
going
,
towards
Saint
Paul
's
.
 
<EOS>
Having
passed
so
much
of
his
time
of
late
in
the
cathedral
,
Leonard
began
to
regard
it
as
a
sort
of
home
,
and
it
now
appeared
like
a
place
of
refuge
to
him
.
<EOS>
Proceeding
to
the
great
western
entrance
,
he
seated
himself
on
one
of
the
large
blocks
of
stone
left
there
by
the
masons
occupied
in
repairing
the
exterior
of
the
fane
.
<EOS>
His
eye
rested
upon
the
mighty
edifice
before
him
,
and
the
clear
sparkling
light
revealed
numberless
points
of
architectural
grandeur
and
beauty
which
he
had
never
before
noticed
.
<EOS>
The
enormous
buttresses
and
lofty
pinnacles
of
the
central
tower
were
tinged
with
the
beams
of
the
rising
sun
,
and
glowed
as
if
built
of
porphyry
.
<EOS>
While
gazing
at
the
summit
of
this
tower
,
and
calling
to
mind
the
magnificent
view
he
had
recently
witnessed
from
it
at
the
same
hour
,
if
a
wish
could
have
transported
him
thither
at
that
moment
,
he
would
have
enjoyed
it
again
.
<EOS>
But
as
this
could
not
be
,
he
tried
to
summon
before
his
mental
vision
the
whole
glorious
prospect
--
the
broad
and
shining
river
,
with
its
moving
or
motionless
craft
--
the
gardens
,
the
noble
mansions
,
the
warehouses
,
and
mighty
wharfs
on
its
banks
--
London
Bridge
,
with
its
enormous
pile
of
habitations
--
the
old
and
picturesque
city
,
with
its
innumerable
towers
,
and
spires
,
and
girdle
of
grey
walls
--
the
green
fields
and
winding
lanes
leading
to
the
lovely
hills
around
it
<EOS>
--
all
these
objects
arose
obedient
to
his
fancy
,
and
came
arrayed
in
colouring
as
fresh
as
that
wherein
they
had
before
appeared
to
him
.
<EOS>
While
thus
occupied
,
his
gaze
remained
riveted
on
the
summit
of
the
central
tower
,
and
he
fancied
he
perceived
some
one
leaning
over
the
balustrade
;
but
as
little
beyond
the
upper
part
of
the
figure
could
be
discerned
,
and
as
it
appeared
perfectly
motionless
,
he
could
not
be
quite
sure
that
his
eyes
did
not
deceive
him
.
<EOS>
Having
gazed
at
the
object
for
some
minutes
,
during
which
it
maintained
the
same
attitude
,
he
continued
his
survey
of
the
pile
,
and
became
so
excited
by
the
sublime
emotions
inspired
by
the
contemplation
,
as
to
be
insensible
to
aught
else
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
while
he
arose
,
and
was
about
to
proceed
towards
the
portico
,
when
,
chancing
to
look
at
the
top
of
the
tower
,
he
remarked
that
the
figure
had
disappeared
,
and
while
wondering
who
it
could
be
,
he
perceived
a
person
emerge
from
one
of
the
tall
windows
in
the
lower
part
of
the
tower
.
<EOS>
It
was
Solomon
Eagle
,
and
he
no
longer
wondered
at
what
he
had
seen
.
<EOS>
The
enthusiast
was
without
his
brazier
,
but
carried
a
long
stout
staff
.
<EOS>
He
ran
along
the
pointed
roof
of
the
nave
with
inconceivable
swiftness
,
till
,
reaching
the
vast
stone
cross
,
upwards
of
twelve
feet
in
height
,
ornamenting
the
western
extremity
,
he
climbed
its
base
,
and
clasping
the
transverse
bar
of
the
sacred
symbol
of
his
faith
with
his
left
arm
,
extended
his
staff
with
his
right
,
and
described
a
circle
,
as
if
pointing
out
the
walls
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
He
then
raised
his
staff
towards
heaven
to
invoke
its
vengeance
,
and
anon
pointed
it
menacingly
downwards
.
<EOS>
After
this
he
broke
into
loud
denunciations
;
but
though
the
apprentice
could
not
hear
the
words
,
he
gathered
their
purport
from
his
gestures
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
a
few
masons
had
assembled
,
and
producing
their
implements
,
commenced
working
at
the
blocks
of
stone
.
<EOS>
Glancing
at
the
enthusiast
,
one
of
them
observed
with
a
smile
to
his
companion
,
"
There
is
Solomon
Eagle
pronouncing
his
morning
curse
upon
the
city
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
the
judgments
he
utters
against
it
will
come
to
pass
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Assuredly
,
Phil
Gatford
,
"
replied
the
other
mason
,
gravely
;
"
and
I
look
upon
all
the
work
we
are
now
doing
as
labour
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
Was
he
not
right
about
the
plague
?
<EOS>
Did
he
not
foretell
the
devouring
scourge
by
which
we
are
visited
?
<EOS>
And
he
will
be
right
also
about
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Since
he
has
doomed
it
,
this
cathedral
will
be
consumed
by
flames
,
and
one
stone
will
not
be
left
standing
on
another
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
strange
,
Ned
Turgis
,
"
observed
Gatford
,
"
that
,
though
Solomon
Eagle
may
always
be
seen
at
daybreak
at
the
top
of
the
tower
or
on
the
roof
of
the
cathedral
--
sometimes
at
one
point
and
sometimes
at
another
--
no
one
can
tell
where
he
hides
himself
at
other
times
.
<EOS>
He
no
longer
roams
the
streets
at
night
,
but
you
may
remember
when
the
officers
of
justice
were
in
search
of
him
,
to
give
evidence
against
Mother
Malmayns
and
Chowles
,
he
was
not
to
be
found
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
remember
it
,
"
replied
Turgis
;
"
but
I
have
no
doubt
he
was
hidden
in
some
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
corner
of
the
cathedral
--
perhaps
among
the
immense
wooden
beams
of
the
clerestory
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Or
in
some
of
the
secret
passages
or
cells
contrived
in
the
thickness
of
the
walls
,
"
rejoined
the
first
speaker
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Ned
Turgis
,
if
the
plague
increases
,
as
there
is
every
likelihood
<EOS>
it
will
,
Solomon
Eagle
will
be
the
only
preacher
left
in
Saint
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
Neither
deans
,
prebends
,
minor
-
canons
,
nor
vicars
will
attend
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
they
have
almost
abandoned
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shame
on
them
!
"
exclaimed
Leonard
Holt
,
who
,
being
much
interested
in
the
conversation
of
the
masons
,
had
silently
approached
them
.
<EOS>
"
At
this
season
,
more
than
ever
,
they
are
bound
to
attend
to
their
duty
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
so
I
think
,
"
rejoined
Gatford
;
"
but
I
suppose
they
consider
self
-
preservation
their
first
duty
.
<EOS>
They
aver
that
all
assemblages
,
whether
called
together
for
religious
purposes
or
not
,
are
dangerous
,
and
likely
to
extend
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
yet
crowds
are
permitted
to
assemble
for
purposes
of
amusement
,
if
not
for
worship
,
in
those
holy
walls
,
"
returned
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
,
"
replied
Gatford
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
few
persons
now
come
there
,
and
none
for
amusement
.
<EOS>
Paul
's
Walk
is
completely
deserted
.
<EOS>
The
shops
and
stalls
have
been
removed
,
and
the
pillars
to
which
they
were
attached
are
restored
to
their
former
appearance
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
far
rather
the
sacred
edifice
were
altogether
abandoned
than
be
what
it
has
been
of
late
--
a
den
of
thieves
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
stable
and
a
magazine
of
arms
in
the
time
of
the
Commonwealth
,
"
remarked
Gatford
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
if
Solomon
Eagle
's
foreboding
come
to
pass
,
it
will
be
a
heap
of
ruins
in
our
own
time
,
"
rejoined
Turgis
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
see
the
prophet
of
ill
has
quitted
his
post
,
and
retired
to
his
hiding
-
place
.
"
 
<EOS>
Looking
up
as
this
was
said
,
Leonard
saw
that
the
enthusiast
had
disappeared
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
great
door
of
the
cathedral
was
thrown
open
,
and
,
quitting
the
masons
,
he
ascended
the
broad
steps
under
the
portico
,
and
entered
the
fane
,
where
he
found
that
the
information
he
had
received
was
correct
,
and
that
the
stalls
and
other
disfigurements
to
the
pillars
had
been
removed
.
<EOS>
After
pacing
the
solitary
aisles
for
some
time
,
he
made
inquiries
from
the
verger
concerning
Solomon
Eagle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
about
him
,
"
replied
the
man
,
reluctantly
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
he
always
appears
at
daybreak
on
some
part
of
the
roof
,
but
I
am
as
ignorant
as
yourself
where
he
hides
himself
.
<EOS>
The
door
of
the
winding
staircase
leading
to
the
central
tower
is
open
.
<EOS>
You
can
ascend
it
,
and
search
for
him
,
if
you
think
proper
.
"
 
<EOS>
Acting
upon
the
suggestion
,
Leonard
mounted
to
the
belfry
,
and
from
thence
to
the
summit
of
the
tower
.
<EOS>
Having
indulged
himself
with
a
brief
survey
of
the
glorious
view
around
,
he
descended
,
and
glanced
into
every
cell
and
chamber
as
he
passed
,
in
the
hopes
of
meeting
with
the
enthusiast
,
but
he
was
disappointed
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
as
he
got
about
half
-
way
down
,
he
felt
his
arm
forcibly
grasped
,
and
,
<EOS>
instantly
conjecturing
who
it
was
,
offered
no
resistance
.
<EOS>
Without
uttering
a
word
,
the
person
who
had
seized
him
dragged
him
up
a
few
steps
,
pushed
aside
a
secret
door
,
which
closed
behind
them
with
a
hollow
clangour
,
and
leading
him
along
a
dark
narrow
passage
,
opened
another
door
,
and
they
emerged
upon
the
roof
.
<EOS>
He
then
found
that
his
suspicion
was
correct
,
and
that
his
mysterious
guide
was
no
other
than
Solomon
Eagle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
find
you
have
recovered
from
the
pestilence
,
"
said
the
enthusiast
,
regarding
him
with
a
friendly
glance
;
"
it
proves
you
are
favoured
by
Heaven
.
<EOS>
I
saw
you
in
the
open
space
before
the
cathedral
this
morning
,
and
instantly
recognised
you
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
the
belfry
when
you
descended
,
but
you
did
not
perceive
me
,
and
I
wished
to
be
certain
you
were
alone
before
I
discovered
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
ceased
to
roam
the
streets
at
night
,
and
rouse
the
slumbering
citizens
to
repentance
?
"
asked
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
the
present
I
have
,
"
returned
Solomon
Eagle
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
appear
again
when
I
am
required
.
<EOS>
But
you
shall
now
learn
why
I
have
brought
you
hither
.
<EOS>
Look
along
those
streets
,
"
he
added
,
pointing
to
the
thoroughfares
opening
in
different
directions
.
<EOS>
"
What
see
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
men
piling
heaps
of
wood
and
coals
at
certain
distances
,
as
if
they
were
preparing
bonfires
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
And
yet
it
can
not
be
.
<EOS>
This
is
no
season
for
rejoicing
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
supposed
that
the
lighting
of
many
thousand
fires
at
once
will
purify
the
air
,
"
replied
Solomon
Eagle
;
"
and
therefore
the
Lord
Mayor
has
given
orders
that
heaps
of
fuel
shall
be
placed
before
every
house
in
every
street
in
the
city
,
and
that
all
these
heaps
shall
be
kindled
at
a
certain
hour
.
<EOS>
But
it
will
be
of
no
avail
.
<EOS>
The
weather
is
now
fine
and
settled
,
and
the
sky
cloudless
.
<EOS>
But
the
offended
Deity
will
cause
the
heaviest
rain
to
descend
,
and
extinguish
their
fires
.
<EOS>
No
--
the
way
to
avert
the
pestilence
is
not
by
fire
,
but
by
prayer
and
penitence
,
by
humiliation
and
fasting
.
<EOS>
Let
this
sinful
people
put
on
sackcloth
and
ashes
.
<EOS>
Let
them
beseech
God
,
by
constant
prayer
,
to
forgive
them
,
and
they
may
prevail
,
but
not
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
when
are
these
fires
to
be
lighted
?
"
asked
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
-
night
,
at
midnight
,
"
replied
Solomon
Eagle
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
took
Leonard
by
the
hand
,
and
led
him
back
the
same
way
he
had
brought
him
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
spiral
staircase
,
he
said
,
"
If
you
desire
to
behold
a
sight
,
such
as
a
man
has
seldom
witnessed
,
ascend
to
the
summit
of
this
tower
an
hour
after
midnight
,
when
all
these
fires
are
lighted
.
<EOS>
A
small
door
on
the
left
of
the
northern
entrance
shall
be
left
open
.
<EOS>
It
will
conduct
you
to
the
back
of
the
choir
,
and
you
must
then
find
your
way
hither
as
well
as
you
can
.
"
 
<EOS>
Murmuring
his
thanks
,
Leonard
hurried
down
the
spiral
staircase
,
and
quitting
the
cathedral
,
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
Wood
-
street
.
<EOS>
Preparations
were
everywhere
making
for
carrying
the
Lord
Mayor
's
orders
into
effect
;
and
such
was
the
beneficial
result
anticipated
,
that
a
general
liveliness
prevailed
,
on
reaching
his
master
's
residence
,
he
found
him
at
the
shutter
,
curious
to
know
what
was
going
forward
;
and
having
informed
him
,
the
grocer
immediately
threw
him
down
money
to
procure
wood
and
coal
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
but
<EOS>
little
faith
in
the
experiment
,
"
he
said
,
"
but
the
Lord
Mayor
's
injunctions
must
be
obeyed
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
the
help
of
Dallison
,
who
had
now
arrived
,
Leonard
Holt
soon
procured
a
large
heap
of
fuel
,
and
placed
it
in
the
middle
of
the
street
.
<EOS>
The
day
was
passed
in
executing
other
commissions
for
the
grocer
,
and
he
took
his
meals
in
the
hutch
with
the
porter
.
<EOS>
Time
appeared
to
pass
with
unusual
slowness
,
and
not
he
alone
,
but
anxious
thousands
,
awaited
the
signal
to
kindle
their
fires
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
profoundly
dark
and
sultry
,
and
Leonard
could
not
help
thinking
that
the
enthusiast
's
prediction
would
be
verified
,
and
that
rain
would
fall
.
<EOS>
But
these
gloomy
anticipations
vanished
as
the
hour
of
midnight
was
tolled
forth
by
the
neighbouring
clocks
of
Saint
Michael
's
and
Saint
Alban
's
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
the
strokes
died
away
,
when
Leonard
seized
a
light
and
set
fire
to
the
pile
.
<EOS>
Ten
thousand
other
piles
were
kindled
at
the
same
moment
,
and
in
an
instant
the
pitchy
darkness
was
converted
into
light
as
bright
as
that
of
noonday
.
 
<EOS>
Anxious
to
behold
this
prodigious
illumination
at
its
best
,
Leonard
Holt
committed
the
replenishing
of
the
pile
and
the
custody
of
the
house
to
Dallison
,
and
hastened
to
Saint
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
A
great
fire
was
burning
at
each
angle
of
the
cathedral
,
but
without
pausing
to
notice
the
effect
of
the
flames
upon
the
walls
of
the
building
,
he
passed
through
the
door
to
which
he
had
been
directed
,
and
hastening
to
the
spiral
staircase
beyond
the
choir
,
ascended
it
with
swift
steps
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
pause
till
he
reached
the
summit
of
the
tower
,
and
there
,
indeed
,
a
wondrous
spectacle
awaited
him
.
<EOS>
The
whole
city
seemed
on
fire
,
and
girded
with
a
flaming
belt
--
for
piles
were
lighted
at
certain
distances
along
the
whole
line
of
walls
.
<EOS>
The
groups
of
dark
figures
collected
round
the
fires
added
to
their
picturesque
effect
;
and
the
course
of
every
street
could
be
traced
by
the
reflection
of
the
flames
on
the
walls
and
gables
of
the
houses
.
<EOS>
London
Bridge
was
discernible
from
the
fires
burning
upon
it
--
and
even
upon
the
river
braziers
were
lighted
on
all
the
larger
craft
,
which
cast
a
ruddy
glow
upon
the
stream
.
 
<EOS>
After
gazing
at
this
extraordinary
sight
for
some
time
,
Leonard
began
to
descend
.
<EOS>
As
yet
he
had
seen
nothing
of
Solomon
Eagle
,
and
searching
for
him
in
vain
in
the
belfry
,
he
quitted
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
From
a
knot
of
persons
gathered
round
one
of
the
fires
he
learnt
that
the
enthusiast
was
addressing
the
crowd
at
the
west
side
of
the
building
,
and
proceeding
thither
<EOS>
he
perceived
him
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
balustrade
of
the
south
-
western
tower
,
surmounting
the
little
church
of
Saint
Gregory
.
<EOS>
His
brazier
was
placed
on
one
of
the
buttresses
,
and
threw
its
light
on
the
mighty
central
tower
of
the
fabric
,
and
on
a
large
clock
-
face
immediately
beneath
.
<EOS>
Solomon
Eagle
was
evidently
denouncing
the
city
,
but
his
words
were
lost
in
the
distance
.
<EOS>
As
he
proceeded
,
a
loud
clap
of
thunder
pealed
overhead
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
comes
--
it
comes
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
enthusiast
,
in
a
voice
that
could
be
distinctly
heard
in
the
death
-
like
stillness
that
followed
the
thunder
.
<EOS>
"
The
wrath
of
Heaven
is
at
hand
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
a
bright
flash
cut
the
air
,
and
a
bolt
struck
down
,
one
of
the
pinnacles
of
the
great
tower
.
<EOS>
Flash
after
flash
followed
in
quick
succession
,
and
the
enthusiast
,
who
seemed
wrapped
in
flame
,
extended
his
arms
towards
Heaven
,
as
if
beseeching
a
further
display
of
its
vengeance
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
the
lightning
ceased
to
flash
and
the
thunder
to
roll
.
<EOS>
A
few
heavy
drops
of
rain
fell
.
<EOS>
These
were
succeeded
by
a
deluging
shower
of
such
violence
,
that
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
every
fire
within
the
city
was
extinguished
,
and
all
was
darkness
and
despair
.
 
<EOS>
The
deepest
gloom
and
despondency
prevailed
that
night
throughout
London
.
<EOS>
The
sudden
storm
was
regarded
as
a
manifestation
of
the
displeasure
of
Heaven
,
and
as
an
intimation
that
the
arrows
of
its
wrath
were
not
to
be
turned
aside
by
any
human
efforts
.
<EOS>
So
impressed
were
all
with
this
feeling
,
that
when
,
in
less
than
half
an
hour
,
the
rain
entirely
ceased
,
the
clouds
cleared
off
,
and
the
stars
again
poured
down
their
lustre
,
no
one
attempted
to
relight
the
quenched
embers
,
fearing
to
provoke
the
Divine
vengeance
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
a
monitor
wanting
to
enforce
the
awful
lesson
.
<EOS>
Solomon
Eagle
,
with
his
brazier
on
his
head
,
ran
through
the
streets
,
calling
on
the
inhabitants
to
take
to
heart
what
had
happened
,
to
repent
,
and
prepare
for
their
doom
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Lord
will
not
spare
you
,
"
he
cried
,
as
he
stationed
himself
in
the
open
space
before
St.
Stephen
's
,
Walbrook
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
visit
your
sins
upon
you
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
therefore
,
that
ye
may
not
be
destroyed
,
both
body
and
soul
.
<EOS>
Little
time
is
allowed
you
for
repentance
.
<EOS>
Many
that
hear
me
shall
not
live
till
tomorrow
;
few
shall
survive
the
year
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
,
thyself
,
shalt
not
survive
the
night
,
false
prophet
,
"
cried
a
voice
from
a
neighbouring
window
.
<EOS>
And
immediately
afterwards
the
barrel
of
a
gun
was
thrust
forth
and
a
shot
fired
at
the
enthusiast
.
<EOS>
But
though
Solomon
Eagle
never
altered
his
position
,
he
was
wholly
uninjured
--
the
ball
striking
a
bystander
,
who
fell
to
the
ground
mortally
wounded
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
shot
your
own
son
,
Mr.
Westwood
,
"
cried
one
of
the
spectators
,
rushing
up
to
the
fallen
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
will
henceforth
doubt
that
Solomon
Eagle
is
under
the
care
of
a
special
providence
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
I
,
"
replied
another
spectator
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
disregard
his
words
in
future
.
"
 
<EOS>
Setting
down
his
brazier
,
the
enthusiast
bent
over
the
dead
man
--
for
dead
he
was
--
and
noted
the
placid
smile
upon
his
features
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
unfortunate
father
had
joined
the
group
,
and
,
on
seeing
the
body
of
his
son
,
wrung
his
hands
in
a
pitiable
manner
,
and
gave
utterance
to
the
wildest
expression
of
despair
.
<EOS>
No
one
attempted
to
seize
him
,
till
at
length
Solomon
Eagle
,
rising
from
his
kneeling
posture
,
laid
his
hand
upon
his
arm
,
and
regarding
him
sternly
,
said
,
"
What
wrong
have
I
done
you
,
that
you
should
seek
to
slay
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
wrong
?
<EOS>
"
rejoined
Westwood--"such
wrong
as
can
never
be
repaired
.
<EOS>
Your
fearful
prophecies
and
denunciations
so
terrified
my
daughter
,
that
she
died
distracted
.
<EOS>
My
brokenhearted
wife
was
not
long
in
following
her
;
and
now
you
have
made
me
the
murderer
of
my
son
.
<EOS>
Complete
the
tragedy
,
and
take
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
desire
to
do
so
,
"
replied
Solomon
Eagle
,
in
a
tone
of
commiseration
.
<EOS>
"
My
wish
is
to
save
your
soul
,
and
the
souls
of
all
who
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
not
that
your
anger
was
at
first
stirred
against
me
;
but
if
your
heart
had
been
properly
directed
,
indignation
would
have
soon
given
way
to
better
feelings
.
<EOS>
My
mission
is
not
to
terrify
,
but
to
warn
.
<EOS>
Why
will
ye
thus
continue
impenitent
when
ye
are
spoken
to
,
not
by
my
voice
alone
,
but
by
a
thousand
others?--by
<EOS>
the
thunder
--
by
the
rain
--
by
the
pestilence!--and
ye
shall
be
spoken
to
,
if
ye
continue
senseless
,
by
fire
and
by
famine
.
<EOS>
Look
at
these
quenched
embers
--
at
these
flooded
streets
--
they
are
types
of
your
vain
struggle
with
a
superior
power
.
<EOS>
Now
,
mark
me
what
you
must
do
to
free
the
city
from
contagion
.
<EOS>
You
must
utterly
and
for
ever
abandon
your
evil
courses
.
<EOS>
You
must
pray
incessantly
for
remission
of
your
sins
.
<EOS>
You
must
resign
yourselves
without
repining
to
such
chastisement
as
you
have
provoked
,
and
must
put
your
whole
trust
and
confidence
in
God
.
<EOS>
Do
this
,
and
do
it
heartily
;
it
is
possible
that
His
wrath
may
be
averted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
the
force
of
your
words
,
"
<EOS>
faltered
<EOS>
Westwood--"would
<EOS>
I
had
felt
it
sooner
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Repentance
never
comes
too
late
,
"
rejoined
the
enthusiast
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
this
be
an
example
to
you
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
snatching
up
his
brazier
,
he
continued
his
course
at
the
same
lightning
speed
as
before
.
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
father
was
taken
into
his
own
dwelling
,
whither
likewise
the
body
of
his
son
was
conveyed
.
<EOS>
A
strict
watch
was
kept
over
him
during
the
night
,
and
in
the
morning
he
was
removed
to
Newgate
,
where
he
perished
,
in
less
than
a
week
,
of
the
distemper
.
 
<EOS>
The
aspect
of
the
streets
on
the
following
day
was
deplorable
enough
.
<EOS>
Not
that
the
weather
was
unfavourable
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
it
was
bright
and
sunny
,
while
the
heated
atmosphere
,
cooled
,
by
the
showers
,
felt
no
longer
oppressive
.
<EOS>
But
the
sight
of
the
half
-
burnt
fires
struck
a
chill
into
every
bosom
,
and
it
was
not
until
the
heaps
were
removed
,
that
the
more
timorous
ventured
forth
at
all
.
<EOS>
The
result
,
too
,
of
the
experiment
was
singularly
unfortunate
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
from
the
extraordinary
heat
occasioned
by
the
lighting
of
so
many
fires
,
or
that
the
smoke
did
not
ascend
,
and
so
kept
down
the
pestilential
effluvia
,
or
that
the
number
of
persons
who
met
together
spread
the
contagion
,
<EOS>
certain
it
was
that
the
pestilence
was
more
widely
extended
than
before
,
and
the
mortality
fearfully
increased
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
commencement
of
the
storm
,
Leonard
Holt
hurried
back
to
Wood
-
street
,
and
reached
his
master
's
dwelling
just
as
the
rain
began
to
descend
in
torrents
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
was
at
the
window
,
and
a
few
words
only
passed
between
him
and
the
apprentice
when
the
latter
was
compelled
to
take
refuge
in
the
hutch
.
<EOS>
Here
he
found
Dallison
the
watchman
,
and
they
listened
in
awe
-
struck
silence
to
the
heavy
showers
,
and
to
the
hissing
of
the
blazing
embers
in
their
struggle
against
the
hostile
element
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
the
latter
sound
ceased
.
<EOS>
Not
a
light
could
be
seen
throughout
the
whole
length
of
the
street
,
nor
was
there
any
red
reflection
of
the
innumerable
fires
as
heretofore
in
the
sky
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
all
were
extinguished
;
and
the
pitiless
pelting
of
the
rain
,
the
roar
of
the
water
-
spouts
,
and
the
rush
of
the
over
-
filled
kennels
,
now
converted
into
rivulets
,
could
alone
be
heard
After
awhile
the
storm
cleared
off
,
and
Leonard
and
his
companion
issued
from
their
retreat
,
and
gazed
in
silence
at
the
drenched
heap
before
them
.
<EOS>
While
thus
occupied
,
the
window
above
them
opened
,
and
the
grocer
appeared
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
,
indeed
,
a
sad
and
striking
lesson
,
"
he
said
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
hope
will
not
be
lost
upon
those
who
have
witnessed
it
.
<EOS>
It
shows
the
utter
impotency
of
a
struggle
against
the
Divine
will
,
and
that
when
a
man
relies
upon
himself
for
preservation
,
he
depends
upon
a
broken
reed
.
<EOS>
If
I
did
not
place
myself
under
Heaven
's
protection
,
I
should
be
sure
that
all
my
own
precautions
were
unavailing
.
<EOS>
I
am
now
about
to
call
up
my
family
to
prayer
.
<EOS>
You
can
join
us
in
our
supplications
,
and
I
trust
they
will
not
be
unheard
.
"
 
<EOS>
Closing
the
window
,
the
grocer
retired
,
and
Leonard
returned
to
the
hutch
,
where
he
fell
upon
his
knees
,
and
as
soon
as
he
supposed
the
family
were
gathered
together
,
commenced
his
own
prayers
.
<EOS>
He
pictured
the
whole
group
assembled
--
the
fervour
of
the
grocer
excited
to
an
unwonted
pitch
by
what
had
just
occurred
--
the
earnest
countenances
of
his
wife
and
the
younger
children
--
and
the
exalted
looks
of
Amabel
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
see
her
--
neither
could
he
hear
her
voice
--
but
he
fancied
how
she
looked
,
and
in
what
terms
she
prayed
--
and
it
was
no
slight
satisfaction
to
him
to
think
that
his
own
voice
ascended
to
Heaven
coupled
with
hers
.
 
<EOS>
On
quitting
the
hutch
,
he
found
Dallison
conversing
with
Doctor
Hodges
.
<EOS>
The
physician
expressed
great
surprise
at
seeing
him
,
and
inquired
how
he
came
to
have
left
his
master
's
house
.
<EOS>
Leonard
related
all
that
had
happened
,
and
besought
his
assistance
in
Nizza
's
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
all
I
can
for
her
,
"
replied
Hodges
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
feel
greatly
interested
about
her
.
<EOS>
But
who
is
this
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
?
<EOS>
I
never
heard
of
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
more
of
him
than
what
I
have
told
you
,
sir
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
a
friend
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
a
feigned
name
,
"
rejoined
Hodges
;
"
but
I
will
speedily
find
him
out
.
<EOS>
You
must
lodge
at
my
house
tonight
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
better
for
you
than
sleeping
in
that
damp
shed
.
<EOS>
But
,
first
,
I
must
have
a
word
or
two
with
your
master
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
abroad
all
night
,
and
came
hither
to
ascertain
what
he
thought
of
this
plan
of
the
fires
,
and
what
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
give
the
signal
to
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
cord
within
the
hutch
by
which
you
can
sound
a
bell
within
his
chamber
,
"
returned
Leonard
;
"
I
will
ring
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
did
so
,
and
the
summons
was
almost
instantly
answered
by
the
grocer
.
<EOS>
A
kindly
greeting
passed
between
the
latter
and
Hodges
,
who
inquired
whether
all
was
going
on
satisfactorily
within
,
and
whether
anything
could
be
done
for
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
have
disturbed
you
at
this
unseasonable
hour
,
"
he
said
,
"
but
chancing
to
be
in
your
neighbourhood
,
and
thinking
it
likely
you
would
be
on
the
watch
,
I
called
to
have
a
word
with
you
.
<EOS>
Though
I
could
not
foresee
what
would
happen
,
I
entirely
disapproved
of
these
fires
as
likely
to
increase
rather
than
check
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
hand
of
Heaven
has
extinguished
them
because
they
were
lighted
in
opposition
to
its
decrees
,
"
replied
Bloundel
;
"
but
you
have
asked
me
whether
all
is
going
on
well
within
.
<EOS>
I
should
answer
readily
in
the
affirmative
,
but
that
my
wife
expresses
much
anxiety
respecting
Amabel
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
longer
any
apprehension
of
misconduct
.
<EOS>
She
is
all
we
could
desire
--
serious
and
devout
.
<EOS>
But
we
have
fears
for
her
health
.
<EOS>
The
confinement
may
be
too
much
for
her
.
<EOS>
What
would
you
recommend
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
her
to
be
able
to
speak
confidently
,
"
replied
Hodges
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
how
that
can
be
accomplished
,
unless
you
choose
to
ascend
by
a
basket
attached
to
the
pulley
,
"
replied
the
grocer
,
with
some
hesitation
,
"
and
it
is
against
my
plan
to
admit
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
your
daughter
's
life
,
my
good
friend
,
"
rejoined
Hodges
;
"
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
If
I
choose
to
risk
life
and
limb
to
visit
her
,
you
may
surely
risk
the
chance
of
contagion
to
admit
me
.
<EOS>
But
you
need
have
no
fear
.
<EOS>
Sprinkle
your
room
with
spirits
of
sulphur
,
and
place
a
phial
of
vinegar
so
that
I
can
use
it
on
my
first
entrance
into
the
house
,
and
I
will
answer
for
the
safety
of
your
family
.
"
 
<EOS>
These
preparations
made
,
Mr.
Bloundel
lowered
the
basket
,
into
which
Hodges
got
,
and
grasping
the
rope
,
not
without
some
misgiving
on
his
part
,
he
was
drawn
up
.
<EOS>
Leonard
witnessed
his
ascent
with
a
beating
heart
,
and
could
scarcely
repress
a
feeling
of
envy
when
he
saw
him
pass
through
the
window
,
and
knew
that
he
would
soon
be
in
the
presence
of
Amabel
.
<EOS>
But
this
feeling
quickly
changed
into
one
of
deep
anxiety
concerning
her
.
<EOS>
Her
father
's
account
of
her
had
increased
the
uneasiness
he
previously
felt
,
and
he
was
as
anxious
to
know
the
doctor
's
opinion
of
her
,
as
if
his
own
fate
had
depended
upon
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
kept
in
this
painful
state
of
suspense
for
nearly
an
hour
,
when
voices
were
heard
at
the
window
,
and
presently
afterwards
Hodges
was
carefully
let
down
.
<EOS>
Bidding
the
grocer
farewell
,
he
desired
Leonard
to
follow
him
,
and
led
the
way
towards
Cheapside
.
<EOS>
They
proceeded
a
short
distance
in
silence
,
when
the
latter
ventured
to
remark
,
"
You
say
nothing
about
Amabel
,
sir
?
<EOS>
I
fear
you
found
her
seriously
indisposed
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
not
question
me
about
her
just
now
,
"
rejoined
the
doctor
,
in
a
subdued
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not
discuss
the
subject
.
"
 
<EOS>
Nothing
more
was
said
;
for
though
the
apprentice
would
willingly
have
continued
the
conversation
,
his
companion
's
evident
disinclination
to
pursue
it
compelled
him
to
desist
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
they
reached
the
doctor
's
residence
,
where
Leonard
was
immediately
shown
to
a
comfortable
bed
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
late
when
he
awoke
next
day
,
and
as
the
doctor
was
gone
forth
,
he
partook
of
a
plentiful
breakfast
which
was
placed
before
him
,
and
repaired
to
Wood
-
street
,
but
his
master
having
no
commissions
for
him
to
execute
,
he
went
back
again
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
Doctor
Hodges
had
returned
,
and
calling
him
into
his
library
told
him
he
wished
to
speak
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
were
right
last
night
,
"
he
said
,
"
in
construing
my
silence
into
alarm
for
Amabel
.
<EOS>
In
truth
,
I
fear
she
is
rapidly
sinking
into
a
decline
,
and
nothing
will
arrest
the
progress
of
the
insidious
disease
but
instant
removal
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
To
this
she
will
not
consent
,
neither
do
I
know
how
it
could
be
accomplished
.
<EOS>
It
is
pitiable
to
see
so
lovely
a
creature
dying
,
as
I
fear
she
is
,
of
a
broken
heart
.

<EOS>
Leonard
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
,
and
wept
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
not
yet
spoken
of
Nizza
Macascree
,
"
said
Hodges
,
after
a
pause
,
tapping
him
kindly
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
discovered
a
trace
of
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
rousing
himself
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
another
victim
of
these
profligates
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
be
revenged
upon
them
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
before
enjoined
you
to
restrain
your
indignation
,
just
though
it
be
,
"
returned
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
yet
found
out
whither
she
has
been
taken
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
a
clue
which
,
unless
I
am
mistaken
,
will
lead
me
to
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
now
dismiss
you
,
I
have
other
affairs
to
attend
to
,
and
must
give
a
dangerous
and
difficult
case
,
on
which
I
have
been
consulted
,
undisturbed
consideration
.
<EOS>
Make
my
house
your
home
as
long
as
you
think
proper
.
"
 
<EOS>
Warmly
thanking
the
doctor
,
Leonard
then
withdrew
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
this
,
he
walked
forth
,
and
ascertaining
that
he
was
not
required
by
his
master
,
determined
to
satisfy
himself
by
actual
observation
of
the
extent
of
the
ravages
of
the
plague
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
he
shaped
his
course
along
Lad
-
lane
,
and
traversing
Cateaton
-
street
,
entered
Lothbury
.
<EOS>
The
number
of
houses
which
he
here
found
closed
,
with
red
crosses
on
the
doors
,
and
the
fatal
inscription
above
them
,
convinced
him
that
the
deplorable
accounts
he
had
heard
were
not
exaggerated
.
<EOS>
In
passing
some
of
these
habitations
,
he
saw
such
ghastly
faces
at
the
windows
,
and
heard
such
lamentable
cries
,
that
he
was
glad
to
hurry
on
and
get
out
of
sight
and
hearing
.
<EOS>
In
Throgmorton
-
street
,
nearly
opposite
Drapers
'
Hall
,
a
poor
wretch
suddenly
opened
a
casement
,
and
before
his
attendants
could
force
him
back
,
threw
himself
from
a
great
height
to
the
ground
,
and
broke
his
neck
.
<EOS>
Another
incident
,
of
an
equally
distressing
nature
,
occurred
.
<EOS>
A
young
and
richly
-
dressed
young
man
issued
from
a
tavern
in
Broad
-
street
,
and
with
a
wild
and
inflamed
countenance
,
staggered
along
.
<EOS>
He
addressed
some
insulting
language
to
Leonard
,
but
the
latter
,
who
desired
no
quarrel
,
disregarded
his
remarks
,
and
let
him
pass
.
<EOS>
The
next
person
encountered
by
the
drunken
man
was
a
young
female
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
catching
her
in
his
arms
,
he
imprinted
a
kiss
upon
her
lips
:
and
then
,
with
a
frightful
laugh
,
shouted
,
"
I
have
given
you
the
plague
!
<EOS>
Look
here
!
"
and
tearing
aside
the
collar
of
his
shirt
,
he
exhibited
a
large
tumour
.
<EOS>
The
young
woman
uttered
a
shriek
of
terror
and
fainted
,
while
her
ruthless
assailant
took
to
his
heels
,
and
running
as
long
as
his
strength
lasted
,
fell
down
,
and
was
taken
to
the
pest
-
house
,
where
he
was
joined
that
same
night
by
his
victim
.
<EOS>
And
this
was
by
no
means
an
uncommon
occurrence
.
<EOS>
The
distemper
acted
differently
on
different
temperaments
.
<EOS>
Some
it
inflamed
to
an
ungovernable
pitch
of
madness
,
others
it
reduced
to
the
depths
of
despair
,
while
in
many
cases
it
brought
out
and
aggravated
the
worst
parts
of
the
character
.
<EOS>
Wives
conveyed
the
infection
intentionally
to
their
husbands
,
husbands
to
their
wives
,
parents
to
their
children
,
lovers
to
the
objects
of
their
affection
,
while
,
as
in
the
case
above
mentioned
,
many
persons
ran
about
like
rabid
hounds
,
striving
to
communicate
it
to
all
they
met
.
<EOS>
Greatly
shocked
at
what
had
occurred
,
and
yet
not
altogether
surprised
at
it
,
for
his
mind
had
become
familiarized
with
horrors
<EOS>
,
Leonard
struck
down
Finch
-
lane
,
and
proceeded
towards
Cornhill
.
<EOS>
On
the
way
,
he
noticed
two
dead
bodies
lying
at
the
mouth
of
a
small
alley
,
and
hastening
past
,
was
stopped
at
the
entrance
to
Cornhill
by
a
butcher
's
apprentice
,
who
was
wheeling
away
the
body
of
an
old
man
,
who
had
just
died
while
purchasing
meat
at
a
stall
at
Stock
's
Market
.
<EOS>
Filled
with
unutterable
loathing
at
this
miserable
spectacle
,
Leonard
was
fain
to
procure
a
glass
of
canary
to
recruit
his
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
he
proceeded
to
the
Globe
Tavern
at
the
corner
of
Birchin
-
lane
.
<EOS>
As
he
entered
the
house
,
a
lively
strain
of
music
caught
his
ear
,
and
glancing
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
,
he
found
it
proceeded
from
the
blind
piper
,
Mike
Macascree
,
who
was
playing
to
some
half
-
dozen
roystering
youths
.
<EOS>
Bell
lay
at
her
master
's
feet
;
and
as
Leonard
approached
the
party
,
she
pricked
up
her
ears
,
and
being
called
by
name
,
instantly
sprang
towards
him
,
and
manifested
the
strongest
delight
.
<EOS>
The
piper
stopped
playing
to
listen
to
what
was
going
forward
<EOS>
but
the
young
men
urged
him
to
proceed
,
and
again
filled
his
glass
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
drink
any
more
,
Mike
,
"
said
Leonard
,
"
but
step
aside
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
've
something
to
say
to
you
--
something
about
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
daughter
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
piper
,
in
a
half
-
angry
,
half
-
sorrowful
voice
,
while
a
slight
moisture
forced
itself
through
his
orbless
lids
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
hear
anything
about
her
,
except
that
she
is
dead
.
<EOS>
She
has
deserted
me
,
and
disgraced
herself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
mistaken
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
;
"
and
if
you
will
come
with
me
,
I
will
explain
the
truth
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
listen
to
no
explanation
,
"
rejoined
the
piper
,
furiously
,
"
she
has
given
me
pain
enough
already
.
<EOS>
I
'm
engaged
with
this
jovial
company
.
<EOS>
Fill
my
glass
,
my
masters
--
there
,
fill
it
again
,
"
he
added
,
draining
it
eagerly
,
and
with
the
evident
wish
to
drown
all
thought
.
<EOS>
"
There
,
now
you
shall
have
such
a
tune
,
as
was
never
listened
to
by
mortal
ears
.
"
 
A
loud
laugh
from
the
young
men
followed
this
proposition
,
and
the
piper
played
away
so
furiously
,
that
it
added
to
their
merriment
.
<EOS>
Touched
with
compassion
,
Leonard
walked
aside
,
hoping
,
when
the
party
broke
up
,
to
be
able
to
have
a
word
with
the
poor
man
.
<EOS>
But
the
piper
's
excitement
increased
.
<EOS>
He
played
faster
and
drank
harder
,
until
it
was
evident
he
was
no
longer
in
a
condition
to
speak
rationally
.
<EOS>
Leonard
,
therefore
,
addressed
himself
to
the
drawer
,
and
desired
him
to
look
after
the
piper
,
engaging
to
return
before
midnight
to
see
how
he
went
on
.
<EOS>
The
drawer
promising
compliance
,
Leonard
departed
;
and
not
feeling
disposed
to
continue
his
walk
,
returned
to
Wood
-
street
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
particular
occurred
during
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Leonard
did
not
see
Doctor
Hodges
,
who
was
engaged
in
his
professional
duties
;
and
after
keeping
watch
before
the
grocer
's
till
nearly
midnight
,
he
again
retraced
his
steps
to
the
Globe
.
<EOS>
The
drawer
was
at
the
door
,
and
about
to
close
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
sorry
to
learn
the
fate
of
the
poor
piper
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
has
happened
to
him
?
"
cried
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
dead
of
the
plague
,
"
was
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
,
so
suddenly
!
"
exclaimed
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
jesting
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
it
is
no
jest
,
"
rejoined
the
drawer
,
in
a
tone
that
convinced
the
apprentice
of
his
sincerity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
entertainers
quitted
him
about
two
hours
ago
,
and
in
spite
of
my
efforts
to
detain
him
,
he
left
the
house
,
and
sat
down
on
those
steps
.
<EOS>
Concluding
he
would
fall
asleep
,
I
did
not
disturb
him
,
and
his
dog
kept
careful
watch
over
him
.
<EOS>
I
forgot
all
about
him
till
a
short
time
ago
,
when
hearing
the
pest
-
cart
pass
,
I
went
forth
,
and
learnt
that
the
drivers
having
found
him
dead
,
as
they
supposed
,
of
the
pestilence
,
had
placed
their
forks
under
his
belt
,
and
thrown
him
upon
the
other
dead
bodies
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
where
is
the
dog
?
"
cried
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
would
not
quit
her
master
,
"
replied
the
drawer
,
"
<EOS>
so
the
men
threw
her
into
the
cart
with
him
,
saying
,
they
would
bury
her
in
the
plague
-
pit
,
as
all
dogs
were
ordered
to
be
destroyed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
must
be
prevented
,
"
cried
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
Which
way
did
the
dead
-
cart
go
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Towards
Moorgate
,
"
replied
the
drawer
.
 
<EOS>
Leonard
heard
no
more
;
but
dashing
through
a
narrow
passage
opposite
the
Conduit
,
passed
Bartholomew
-
lane
,
and
traversing
Lothbury
,
soon
reached
Coleman
-
street
and
the
old
city
gate
,
to
which
he
had
been
directed
.
<EOS>
Here
he
learnt
that
the
dead
-
cart
had
passed
through
it
about
five
minutes
before
,
and
he
hurried
on
towards
Finsbury
Fields
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
proceeded
far
when
he
heard
a
sound
as
of
a
pipe
at
a
distance
,
furiously
played
,
and
accompanied
by
the
barking
of
a
dog
.
<EOS>
These
sounds
were
followed
by
cries
of
alarm
,
and
he
presently
perceived
two
persons
running
towards
him
,
with
a
swiftness
which
only
could
be
occasioned
by
terror
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
carried
a
lantern
,
and
grasping
his
arm
,
the
apprentice
detained
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
devil
's
the
matter
,
"
replied
the
man--"the
piper
's
ghost
has
appeared
in
that
cart
,
and
is
playing
his
old
tunes
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
it
's
either
his
spirit
,
or
he
is
come
to
life
again
,
"
observed
the
other
man
,
stopping
likewise
.
<EOS>
"
I
tossed
him
into
the
cart
myself
,
and
will
swear
he
was
dead
enough
then
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
committed
a
dreadful
mistake
,
"
cried
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
tossed
a
living
man
into
the
cart
instead
of
a
dead
one
.
<EOS>
Do
you
not
hear
those
sounds
?
"
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
,
the
notes
of
the
pipe
swelled
to
a
louder
strain
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
it
is
the
devil
--
or
a
ghost
,
"
replied
the
driver
;
"
I
will
stay
here
no
longer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Lend
me
your
lantern
,
and
I
will
go
to
the
cart
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
it
,
"
replied
the
man
;
"
but
I
caution
you
to
stay
where
you
are
.
<EOS>
You
may
receive
a
shock
you
will
never
survive
.
"
 
<EOS>
Paying
no
attention
to
what
was
said
,
Leonard
ran
towards
the
cart
,
and
found
the
piper
seated
upon
a
pile
of
dead
bodies
,
most
of
them
stripped
of
their
covering
,
with
Bell
by
his
side
,
and
playing
away
at
a
prodigious
rate
.

<EOS>
THE
DANCE
OF
DEATH
.
 
<EOS>
The
condition
of
the
prisons
at
this
season
was
really
frightful
.
<EOS>
In
Newgate
,
in
particular
,
where
the
distemper
broke
out
at
the
beginning
of
June
,
it
raged
with
such
violence
that
in
less
than
a
week
,
more
than
half
the
prisoners
were
swept
off
,
and
it
appeared
probable
,
that
,
unless
its
fury
abated
,
not
a
soul
would
be
left
alive
within
it
.
<EOS>
At
all
times
,
this
crowded
and
ill
-
kept
prison
was
infested
by
the
gaol
-
fever
and
other
pestilential
disorders
,
but
these
were
mild
in
comparison
with
the
present
terrible
visitation
.
<EOS>
The
atmosphere
was
noisome
and
malignant
;
the
wards
were
never
cleansed
;
and
many
poor
wretches
,
who
died
in
their
cells
,
were
left
there
till
the
attendants
on
the
dead
-
cart
chose
to
drag
them
forth
.
<EOS>
No
restraint
being
placed
upon
the
sick
,
and
the
rules
of
the
prison
allowing
them
the
free
use
of
any
strong
liquors
they
could
purchase
,
the
scenes
that
occurred
were
too
dreadful
and
revolting
for
description
,
and
could
only
be
paralleled
by
the
orgies
of
a
pandemonium
.
<EOS>
Many
reckless
beings
,
conscious
that
they
were
attacked
by
a
fatal
disorder
,
drank
as
long
as
they
could
raise
the
'
cup
to
their
lips
,
and
after
committing
the
wildest
and
most
shocking
extravagances
,
died
in
a
state
of
frenzy
.
 
<EOS>
Newgate
became
thus
,
as
it
were
,
the
very
focus
of
infection
,
where
the
plague
assumed
its
worst
aspect
,
and
where
its
victims
perished
far
more
expeditiously
than
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Two
of
the
turnkeys
had
already
died
of
the
distemper
,
and
such
was
the
alarm
entertained
,
that
no
persons
could
be
found
to
supply
their
places
.
<EOS>
To
penetrate
the
recesses
of
the
prison
,
was
almost
to
insure
destruction
,
and
none
but
the
attendants
of
the
dead
-
cart
and
the
nurses
attempted
it
.
<EOS>
Among
the
latter
was
Judith
.
<EOS>
Employed
as
a
nurse
on
the
first
outburst
of
the
plague
,
she
willingly
and
fearlessly
undertook
the
office
.
<EOS>
The
worse
the
disease
became
the
better
pleased
she
appeared
;
and
she
was
so
utterly
without
apprehension
,
that
when
no
one
would
approach
the
cell
where
some
wretched
sufferer
lay
expiring
,
she
unhesitatingly
entered
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
to
render
aid
,
but
to
plunder
,
that
she
thus
exercised
her
functions
.
<EOS>
She
administered
no
medicine
,
dressed
no
tumours
,
and
did
not
contribute
in
the
slightest
degree
to
the
comfort
of
the
miserable
wretches
committed
to
her
charge
.
<EOS>
All
she
desired
was
to
obtain
whatever
valuables
they
possessed
,
or
to
wring
from
them
any
secret
that
might
afterwards
be
turned
to
account
.
<EOS>
Foreseeing
that
Newgate
must
ere
long
be
depopulated
,
and
having
no
fears
for
herself
,
she
knew
that
she
must
then
be
liberated
,
and
be
able
once
more
to
renew
her
mischievous
practices
upon
mankind
.
<EOS>
Her
marvellous
preservation
throughout
all
the
dangers
to
which
she
was
exposed
seemed
almost
to
warrant
the
supposition
that
she
had
entered
into
a
compact
with
the
pestilence
,
to
extend
its
ravages
by
every
means
in
her
power
,
on
the
condition
of
being
spared
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
the
outbreak
of
the
plague
in
Newgate
,
all
the
debtors
were
liberated
,
and
if
the
keepers
had
had
their
own
way
,
the
common
felons
would
have
been
likewise
released
.
<EOS>
But
this
could
not
be
,
and
they
were
kept
to
perish
as
before
described
.
<EOS>
Matters
,
however
,
grew
so
serious
,
that
it
became
a
question
whether
the
few
miserable
wretches
left
alive
ought
to
be
longer
detained
,
and
at
last
the
turnkeys
refusing
to
act
any
longer
,
and
delivering
their
keys
to
the
governor
,
the
whole
of
the
prisoners
were
set
free
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
night
of
their
liberation
,
Chowles
and
Judith
proceeded
to
the
vaults
of
Saint
Faith
's
,
to
deposit
within
them
the
plunder
they
had
obtained
in
the
prison
.
<EOS>
They
found
them
entirely
deserted
.
<EOS>
Neither
verger
,
sexton
,
nor
any
other
person
,
was
to
be
seen
,
and
they
took
up
their
quarters
in
the
crypt
.
<EOS>
Having
brought
a
basket
of
provisions
and
a
few
bottles
of
wine
with
them
,
they
determined
to
pass
the
night
in
revelry
;
and
,
accordingly
,
having
lighted
a
fire
with
the
fragments
of
old
coffins
brought
from
the
charnel
,
they
sat
down
to
their
meal
.
<EOS>
Having
done
full
justice
to
it
,
and
disposed
of
the
first
flask
,
they
were
about
to
abandon
themselves
to
unrestrained
enjoyment
,
when
their
glee
was
all
at
once
interrupted
by
a
strange
and
unaccountable
noise
in
the
adjoining
church
.
<EOS>
Chowles
,
who
had
just
commenced
chanting
one
of
his
wild
melodies
,
suddenly
stopped
,
and
Judith
set
down
the
glass
she
had
raised
to
her
lips
untested
.
<EOS>
What
could
it
mean
?
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
could
tell
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
like
strains
of
unearthly
music
,
mixed
with
shrieks
and
groans
as
of
tortured
spirits
,
accompanied
by
peals
of
such
laughter
as
might
be
supposed
to
proceed
,
from
demons
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
dead
are
burst
forth
from
their
tombs
,
"
cried
Chowles
,
in
a
quavering
voice
,
"
and
are
attended
by
a
legion
of
evil
spirits
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
seem
so
,
"
replied
Judith
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
behold
the
sight
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
for
the
world
!
"
rejoined
Chowles
,
shuddering
,
"
and
I
would
recommend
you
to
stay
where
you
are
.
<EOS>
You
may
behold
your
dead
husband
among
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
so
?
"
rejoined
Judith
,
halting
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
it
,
"
cried
Chowles
,
eagerly
.
"
<EOS>
Stay
where
you
are
--
stay
where
you
are
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
there
was
another
peal
of
infernal
laughter
,
and
the
strains
of
music
grew
louder
each
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
what
may
,
I
will
see
what
it
is
,
"
said
Judith
,
emptying
her
glass
,
as
if
seeking
courage
from
the
draught
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Surely
,
"
she
added
,
in
a
taunting
tone
,
"
you
will
come
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
of
nothing
earthly
,
"
rejoined
<EOS>
Chowles--"but
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
to
face
beings
of
another
world
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
go
alone
,
"
rejoined
Judith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
that
shall
never
be
,
"
replied
Chowles
,
tottering
after
her
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
opened
the
door
and
crossed
the
charnel
,
such
an
extraordinary
combination
of
sounds
burst
upon
their
ears
that
they
again
paused
,
and
looked
anxiously
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
Chowles
laid
his
hand
on
his
companion
's
arm
,
and
strove
to
detain
her
,
but
she
would
not
be
stayed
,
and
he
was
forced
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
Setting
down
the
lamp
on
the
stone
floor
,
Judith
passed
into
the
subterranean
church
,
where
she
beheld
a
sight
that
almost
petrified
her
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
nave
,
which
was
illumined
by
a
blue
glimmering
light
,
whence
proceeding
it
was
impossible
to
determine
,
stood
a
number
of
grotesque
figures
,
apparelled
in
fantastic
garbs
,
and
each
attended
by
a
skeleton
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
latter
grisly
shapes
were
playing
on
tambours
,
others
on
psalteries
,
others
on
rebecs
--
every
instrument
producing
the
strangest
sound
imaginable
.
<EOS>
Viewed
through
the
massive
pillars
,
beneath
that
dark
and
ponderous
roof
,
and
by
the
mystic
light
before
described
,
this
strange
company
had
a
supernatural
appearance
,
and
neither
Chowles
nor
Judith
doubted
for
a
moment
that
they
beheld
before
them
a
congregation
of
phantoms
.
<EOS>
An
irresistible
feeling
of
curiosity
prompted
them
to
advance
.
<EOS>
On
drawing
nearer
,
they
found
the
assemblage
comprehended
all
ranks
of
society
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
pope
in
his
tiara
and
pontifical
dress
;
a
cardinal
in
his
cap
and
robes
;
a
monarch
with
a
sceptre
in
his
hand
,
and
arrayed
in
the
habiliments
of
royalty
;
a
crowned
queen
;
a
bishop
wearing
his
mitre
,
and
carrying
his
crosier
;
an
abbot
,
likewise
in
his
mitre
,
and
bearing
a
crosier
;
a
duke
in
his
robes
of
state
;
a
grave
canon
of
the
church
;
a
knight
sheathed
in
armour
;
a
judge
,
an
advocate
,
and
a
magistrate
,
all
in
their
robes
;
a
mendicant
friar
and
a
nun
;
and
the
list
was
completed
by
a
physician
,
an
astrologer
,
a
miser
,
a
merchant
,
a
duchess
,
a
pedler
,
a
soldier
,
a
gamester
,
an
idiot
,
a
robber
,
a
blind
man
,
and
a
beggar
--
each
distinguishable
by
his
apparel
.
 
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
,
with
a
wild
and
gibbering
laugh
that
chilled
the
beholders
'
blood
,
one
of
the
tallest
and
grisliest
of
the
skeletons
sprang
forward
,
and
beating
his
drum
,
the
whole
ghostly
company
formed
,
two
and
two
,
into
a
line
--
a
skeleton
placing
itself
on
the
right
of
every
mortal
.
<EOS>
In
this
order
,
the
fantastic
procession
marched
between
the
pillars
,
the
unearthly
music
playing
all
the
while
,
and
disappeared
at
the
further
extremity
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
With
the
last
of
the
group
,
the
mysterious
light
vanished
,
and
Chowles
and
his
companion
were
left
in
profound
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
can
it
mean
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Judith
,
as
soon
as
she
recovered
her
speech
.
"
<EOS>
Are
they
human
,
or
spirits
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Human
beings
do
n't
generally
amuse
themselves
in
this
way
,
"
returned
Chowles
.
"
<EOS>
But
hark!--I
still
hear
the
music.--They
are
above
--
in
Saint
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
join
them
,
"
said
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
resolved
to
see
the
end
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
leave
me
behind
,
"
returned
Chowles
,
following
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
keep
company
with
Beelzebub
and
all
his
imps
than
be
alone
.
"
 
<EOS>
Both
were
too
well
acquainted
with
the
way
to
need
any
light
.
<EOS>
Ascending
the
broad
stone
steps
,
they
presently
emerged
into
the
cathedral
,
which
they
found
illumined
by
the
same
glimmering
light
as
the
lower
church
,
and
they
perceived
the
ghostly
assemblage
gathered
into
an
immense
ring
,
and
dancing
round
the
tall
skeleton
,
who
continued
beating
his
drum
,
and
uttering
a
strange
gibbering
sound
,
which
was
echoed
by
the
others
.
<EOS>
Each
moment
the
dancers
increased
the
swiftness
of
their
pace
,
until
at
last
it
grew
to
a
giddy
whirl
,
and
then
,
all
at
once
,
with
a
shriek
of
laughter
,
the
whole
company
fell
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Chowles
and
Judith
,
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
understood
,
from
the
confusion
that
ensued
,
and
the
exclamations
uttered
,
that
they
were
no
spirits
they
had
to
deal
with
,
but
beings
of
the
same
mould
as
themselves
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
they
approached
the
party
of
masquers
,
for
such
they
proved
,
and
found
on
inquiry
that
they
were
a
party
of
young
gallants
,
who
,
headed
by
the
Earl
of
Rochester
--
the
representative
of
the
tall
skeleton
--
had
determined
to
realize
the
Dance
of
Death
,
as
once
depicted
on
the
walls
of
an
ancient
cloister
at
the
north
of
the
cathedral
,
called
Pardon
-
churchyard
,
on
the
walls
of
which
,
says
Stowe
,
were
"
artificially
and
richly
painted
the
Dance
of
Macabre
,
or
Dance
of
Death
,
commonly
called
the
Dance
of
Paul
's
,
<EOS>
the
like
whereof
was
painted
about
Saint
Innocent
's
,
at
Paris
.
<EOS>
The
metres
,
or
poesy
of
this
dance
,
"
proceeds
the
same
authority
,
"
were
translated
out
of
Trench
into
English
by
John
Lydgate
,
monk
of
Bury
,
and
,
with
the
picture
of
Death
leading
all
estates
,
painted
about
the
cloister
,
at
the
special
request
and
expense
of
Jenkin
Carpenter
,
in
the
reign
of
Henry
the
Sixth
.
"
<EOS>
Pardon
-
churchyard
was
pulled
down
by
the
Protector
Somerset
,
in
the
reign
of
Edward
the
Sixth
,
and
the
materials
employed
in
the
erection
of
his
own
palace
in
the
Strand
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
discussion
of
these
singular
paintings
,
and
of
the
designs
on
the
same
subject
ascribed
to
Holbein
,
that
led
the
Earl
of
Rochester
and
his
companions
to
propose
the
fantastic
spectacle
above
described
.
<EOS>
With
the
disposition
which
this
reckless
nobleman
possessed
to
turn
the
most
solemn
and
appalling
subjects
to
jest
,
he
thought
no
season
so
fitting
for
such
an
entertainment
as
the
present
--
just
as
in
our
own
time
the
lively
Parisians
made
the
cholera
,
while
raging
in
their
city
,
the
subject
of
a
carnival
pastime
.
<EOS>
The
exhibition
witnessed
by
Chowles
and
Judith
was
a
rehearsal
of
the
masque
intended
to
be
represented
in
the
cathedral
on
the
following
night
.
 
<EOS>
Again
marshalling
his
band
,
the
Earl
of
Rochester
beat
his
drum
,
and
skipping
before
them
,
led
the
way
towards
the
south
door
of
the
cathedral
,
which
was
thrown
open
by
an
unseen
hand
,
and
the
procession
glided
through
it
like
a
troop
of
spectres
.
<EOS>
Chowles
,
whose
appearance
was
not
unlike
that
of
an
animated
skeleton
,
was
seized
with
a
strange
desire
to
join
in
what
was
going
forward
,
and
taking
off
his
doublet
,
and
baring
his
bony
arms
and
legs
,
he
followed
the
others
,
dancing
round
Judith
in
the
same
manner
that
the
other
skeletons
danced
round
their
partners
.
 
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
Convocation
House
,
a
door
was
opened
,
and
the
procession
entered
the
cloisters
;
and
here
Chowles
,
dragging
Judith
into
the
area
between
him
and
the
beautiful
structure
they
surrounded
,
began
a
dance
of
so
extraordinary
a
character
that
the
whole
troop
collected
round
to
witness
it
.
<EOS>
Rochester
beat
his
drum
,
and
the
other
representatives
of
mortality
who
were
provided
with
musical
instruments
struck
up
a
wild
kind
of
accompaniment
,
to
which
Chowles
executed
the
most
grotesque
flourishes
.
<EOS>
So
wildly
excited
did
he
become
,
and
such
extravagances
<EOS>
did
he
commit
,
that
even
Judith
stared
aghast
at
him
,
and
began
to
think
his
wits
were
fled
.
<EOS>
Now
he
whirled
round
her
--
now
sprang
high
into
the
air
--
now
twined
his
lean
arms
round
her
waist
--
now
peeped
over
one
shoulder
,
now
over
the
other
--
and
at
last
griped
her
neck
so
forcibly
,
that
he
might
perhaps
have
strangled
her
,
if
she
had
not
broken
from
him
,
and
dealt
him
a
severe
blow
that
brought
him
senseless
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
On
recovering
,
he
found
himself
in
the
arched
entrance
of
a
large
octagonal
chamber
,
lighted
at
each
side
by
a
lofty
pointed
window
filled
with
stained
glass
.
<EOS>
Round
this
chamber
ran
a
wide
stone
bench
,
with
a
richly
-
carved
back
of
the
same
material
,
on
which
the
masquers
were
seated
,
and
opposite
the
entrance
was
a
raised
seat
,
ordinarily
allotted
to
the
dean
,
but
now
occupied
by
the
Earl
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
A
circular
oak
table
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
chamber
,
covered
with
magnificent
silver
dishes
,
heaped
with
the
choicest
viands
,
which
were
handed
to
the
guests
by
the
earl
's
servants
,
all
of
whom
represented
skeletons
,
and
it
had
a
strange
effect
,
to
behold
these
ghastly
objects
filling
the
cups
of
the
revellers
,
bending
obsequiously
before
some
blooming
dame
,
or
crowding
round
their
spectral
-
looking
lord
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
Chowles
was
so
confused
,
that
he
thought
he
must
have
awakened
in
another
world
,
but
by
degrees
he
called
to
mind
what
had
occurred
,
and
ascertained
from
Judith
that
he
was
in
the
Convocation
House
.
<EOS>
Getting
up
,
he
joined
the
train
of
grisly
attendants
,
and
acquitted
himself
so
well
that
the
earl
engaged
him
as
performer
in
the
masque
.
<EOS>
He
was
furthermore
informed
that
,
in
all
probability
,
the
king
himself
,
with
many
of
his
favourite
nobles
,
and
the
chief
court
beauties
,
would
be
present
to
witness
the
spectacle
.
 
<EOS>
The
banquet
over
,
word
was
brought
that
chairs
and
coaches
were
without
,
and
the
company
departed
,
leaving
behind
only
a
few
attendants
,
who
remained
to
put
matters
in
order
.
 
<EOS>
While
they
were
thus
occupied
,
Judith
,
who
had
fixed
her
greedy
eyes
upon
the
plate
,
observed
,
in
an
under
-
tone
,
to
Chowles
,
"
There
will
be
fine
plunder
for
us
.
<EOS>
We
must
manage
to
carry
off
all
that
plate
while
they
are
engaged
in
the
masque
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
do
it
yourself
,
then
,
"
returned
Chowles
,
in
the
same
<EOS>
tone--"for
<EOS>
I
shall
have
to
play
a
principal
part
in
the
entertainment
,
and
as
the
king
himself
will
be
present
,
I
can
not
give
up
such
an
opportunity
of
distinguishing
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
have
no
share
in
the
prize
,
if
you
lend
no
assistance
,
"
replied
Judith
,
with
a
dissatisfied
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
,
"
rejoined
Chowles
;
"
on
this
occasion
it
is
all
yours
.
<EOS>
The
Dance
of
Death
is
too
much
to
my
taste
to
be
given
up
.
"
 
<EOS>
Perceiving
they
were
noticed
,
Chowles
and
Judith
then
left
the
Convocation
House
,
and
returned
to
the
vault
in
Saint
Faith
's
,
nor
did
they
emerge
from
it
until
late
on
the
following
day
.
 
<EOS>
Some
rumour
of
the
masque
having
gone
abroad
,
towards
evening
a
crowd
,
chiefly
composed
of
the
most
worthless
order
of
society
,
collected
under
the
portico
at
the
western
entrance
,
and
the
great
doors
being
opened
by
Chowles
<EOS>
,
they
entered
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
Thus
was
this
sacred
building
once
more
invaded
--
once
again
a
scene
of
noise
,
riot
,
and
confusion
--
its
vaulted
roofs
instead
of
echoing
the
voice
of
prayer
,
or
the
choral
hymn
,
resounded
with
loud
laughter
,
imprecations
,
and
licentious
discourse
.
<EOS>
This
disorder
,
however
,
was
kept
in
some
bounds
by
a
strong
body
of
the
royal
guard
,
who
soon
afterwards
arrived
,
and
stationing
themselves
in
parties
of
three
or
four
at
each
of
the
massive
columns
flanking
the
aisles
,
maintained
some
show
of
decorum
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
there
were
others
of
the
royal
attendants
,
bearing
torches
,
who
walked
from
place
to
place
,
and
compelled
all
loiterers
in
dark
corners
to
proceed
to
the
nave
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
before
midnight
,
the
great
doors
were
again
thrown
open
,
and
a
large
troop
of
richly
-
attired
personages
,
all
wearing
masks
,
were
admitted
.
<EOS>
For
a
short
time
they
paced
to
and
fro
between
its
shafted
pillars
gazing
at
the
spectators
grouped
around
,
and
evidently
,
from
their
jests
and
laughter
,
not
a
little
entertained
by
the
scene
.
<EOS>
As
the
clock
struck
twelve
,
however
,
all
sounds
were
hushed
,
and
the
courtly
party
stationed
themselves
on
the
steps
leading
to
the
choir
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
,
also
,
the
torches
were
extinguished
,
and
the
whole
of
the
building
buried
in
profound
darkness
.
<EOS>
Presently
after
,
a
sound
was
heard
of
footsteps
approaching
the
nave
,
but
nothing
could
be
discerned
.
<EOS>
Expectation
was
kept
on
the
rack
for
some
minutes
,
during
which
many
a
stifled
cry
was
heard
from
those
whose
courage
failed
them
at
this
trying
juncture
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
,
a
blue
light
illumined
the
nave
,
and
partially
revealed
the
lofty
pillars
by
which
it
was
surrounded
.
<EOS>
By
this
light
the
whole
of
the
ghostly
company
could
be
seen
drawn
up
near
the
western
door
.
<EOS>
They
were
arranged
two
and
two
,
a
skeleton
standing
as
before
on
the
right
of
each
character
.
<EOS>
The
procession
next
marched
slowly
and
silently
towards
the
choir
,
and
drew
up
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
,
to
give
the
royal
party
an
opportunity
of
examining
them
.
<EOS>
After
pausing
there
for
a
few
minutes
,
Rochester
,
in
the
dress
of
the
larger
skeleton
,
started
off
,
and
,
beating
his
drum
,
was
followed
by
the
pope
and
his
attendant
skeleton
.
<EOS>
This
couple
having
danced
together
for
some
minutes
,
to
the
infinite
diversion
of
the
spectators
,
disappeared
behind
a
pillar
,
and
were
succeeded
by
the
monarch
and
a
second
skeleton
.
<EOS>
These
,
in
their
turn
,
gave
way
to
the
cardinal
and
his
companion
,
and
so
on
till
the
whole
of
the
masquers
had
exhibited
themselves
,
when
at
a
signal
from
the
earl
the
party
re
-
appeared
,
and
formed
a
ring
round
him
.
<EOS>
The
dance
was
executed
with
great
spirit
,
and
elicited
tumultuous
applause
from
all
the
beholders
.
<EOS>
The
earl
now
retired
,
and
Chowles
took
his
place
.
<EOS>
He
was
clothed
in
an
elastic
dress
painted
of
a
leaden
and
cadaverous
colour
,
which
fitted
closely
to
his
fleshless
figure
,
and
defined
all
his
angularities
.
<EOS>
He
carried
an
hour
-
glass
in
one
hand
and
a
dart
in
the
other
,
and
in
the
course
of
the
dance
kept
continually
pointing
the
latter
at
those
who
moved
around
him
.
<EOS>
His
feats
of
the
previous
evening
were
nothing
to
his
present
achievements
.
<EOS>
His
joints
creaked
,
and
his
eyes
flamed
like
burning
coals
.
<EOS>
As
he
continued
,
his
excitement
increased
.
<EOS>
He
bounded
higher
,
and
his
countenance
assumed
so
hideous
an
expression
,
that
those
near
him
recoiled
in
terror
,
crying
,
"
Death
himself
had
broke
loose
among
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
consternation
soon
became
general
.
<EOS>
The
masquers
fled
in
dismay
,
and
scampered
along
the
aisles
scarcely
knowing
whither
they
were
going
.
<EOS>
Delighted
with
the
alarm
he
occasioned
,
Chowles
chased
a
large
party
along
the
northern
aisle
,
and
was
pursuing
them
across
the
transept
upon
which
it
opened
,
when
he
was
arrested
in
his
turn
by
another
equally
formidable
figure
,
who
suddenly
placed
himself
in
his
path
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
exclaimed
Solomon
Eagle
--
<EOS>
for
it
was
the
enthusiast
--
in
a
voice
of
thunder
,
"
it
is
time
this
scandalous
exhibition
should
cease
.
<EOS>
Know
all
ye
who
make
a
mockery
of
death
,
that
his
power
will
be
speedily
and
fearfully
approved
upon
you
.
<EOS>
Thine
not
to
escape
the
vengeance
of
the
Great
Being
whose
temple
you
have
profaned
.
<EOS>
And
you
,
O
king
!
<EOS>
who
have
sanctioned
these
evil
doings
by
your
presence
,
and
who
by
your
own
dissolute
life
set
a
pernicious
example
to
all
your
subjects
,
know
that
your
city
shall
be
utterly
laid
waste
,
first
by
plague
and
then
by
fire
.
<EOS>
Tremble
!
<EOS>
my
warning
is
as
terrible
and
true
as
the
handwriting
on
the
wall
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
art
thou
who
holdest
this
language
towards
me
?
"
demanded
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
called
Solomon
Eagle
,
"
replied
the
enthusiast
,
"
and
am
charged
with
a
mission
from
on
high
to
warn
your
doomed
people
of
their
fate
.
<EOS>
Be
warned
yourself
,
sire
!
<EOS>
Your
end
will
be
sudden
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
snatched
away
in
the
midst
of
your
guilty
pleasure
,
and
with
little
time
for
repentance
.
<EOS>
Be
warned
,
I
say
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
he
turned
to
depart
.
 
<EOS>
"
Secure
the
knave
,
"
cried
Charles
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
He
shall
be
soundly
scourged
for
his
insolence
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
bursting
through
the
guard
,
Solomon
Eagle
ran
swiftly
up
the
choir
and
disappeared
,
nor
could
his
pursuers
discover
any
traces
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Strange
!
"
exclaimed
the
king
,
when
he
was
told
of
the
enthusiast
's
escape
.
"
<EOS>
Let
us
go
to
supper
.
<EOS>
This
masque
has
given
me
the
vapours
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
Heaven
it
have
not
given
us
the
plague
,
"
observed
the
fair
Stewart
,
who
stood
beside
him
,
taking
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
to
be
hoped
not
,
"
rejoined
Charles
;
"
but
,
odds
fish
!
<EOS>
it
is
a
most
dismal
affair
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
,
in
more
ways
than
one
,
"
replied
Rochester
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
have
just
learnt
that
all
my
best
plate
has
been
carried
off
from
the
Convocation
House
.
<EOS>
I
shall
only
be
able
to
offer
your
majesty
and
your
fair
partner
a
sorry
supper
.

<EOS>
THE
PLAGUE
-
PIT
.
 
<EOS>
On
being
made
acquainted
by
Leonard
,
who
helped
him
out
of
the
pest
-
cart
,
with
the
danger
he
had
run
,
the
piper
uttered
a
cry
of
terror
,
and
swooned
away
.
<EOS>
The
buriers
,
seeing
how
matters
stood
,
and
that
their
superstitious
fears
were
altogether
groundless
,
now
returned
,
and
one
of
them
,
producing
a
phial
of
vinegar
,
sprinkled
the
fainting
man
with
it
,
and
speedily
brought
him
to
himself
.
<EOS>
But
though
so
far
recovered
,
his
terror
had
by
no
means
abated
,
and
he
declared
his
firm
conviction
that
he
was
infected
by
the
pestilence
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
carried
towards
the
plague
-
pit
by
mistake
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
soon
be
conveyed
thither
in
right
earnest
,
and
not
have
the
power
of
frightening
away
my
conductors
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
pooh
!
<EOS>
"
cried
one
of
the
buriers
,
jestingly
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
often
ride
with
us
,
and
play
us
many
a
merry
tune
as
you
go
.
<EOS>
You
shall
always
be
welcome
to
a
seat
in
the
cart
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
of
good
cheer
,
"
added
Leonard
,
"
and
all
will
be
well
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
to
an
apothecary
's
shop
,
and
I
will
procure
a
cordial
for
you
,
which
shall
speedily
dispel
your
qualms
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
piper
shook
his
head
,
and
replied
,
with
a
deep
groan
,
that
he
was
certain
all
was
over
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
However
,
I
will
not
reject
your
kindness
,
"
he
added
,
"
though
I
feel
I
am
past
the
help
of
medicine
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
With
this
,
he
whistled
to
Bell
,
who
was
skipping
about
Leonard
,
having
recognised
him
on
his
first
approach
,
and
they
proceeded
towards
the
second
postern
in
London
-
wall
,
between
Moorgate
and
Cripplegate
;
while
the
buriers
,
laughing
heartily
at
the
adventure
,
took
their
way
towards
the
plague
-
pit
,
and
discharged
their
dreadful
load
within
it
.
<EOS>
Arrived
in
Basinghall
-
street
,
and
looking
round
,
Leonard
soon
discovered
by
the
links
at
the
door
,
as
well
as
by
the
crowd
collected
before
it
--
for
day
and
night
the
apothecaries
'
dwellings
were
besieged
by
the
sick
--
the
shop
of
which
he
was
in
search
.
<EOS>
It
was
long
before
they
could
obtain
admittance
,
and
during
this
time
the
piper
said
he
felt
himself
getting
rapidly
worse
;
but
,
imagining
he
was
merely
labouring
under
the
effect
of
fright
,
Leonard
paid
little
attention
to
his
complaints
.
<EOS>
The
apothecary
,
however
,
no
sooner
set
eyes
upon
him
,
than
he
pronounced
him
infected
,
and
,
on
examination
,
it
proved
that
the
fatal
tokens
had
already
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
it
was
so
,
"
cried
the
piper
.
<EOS>
"
Take
me
to
the
pest
-
house
--
take
me
to
the
pest
-
house
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
desire
had
better
be
complied
with
,
"
observed
the
apothecary
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
able
to
walk
thither
now
,
but
I
will
not
answer
for
his
being
able
to
do
so
two
hours
hence
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
bad
case
,
"
he
added
in
an
under
-
tone
to
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
Feeing
the
apothecary
,
Leonard
set
out
with
the
piper
,
and
passing
through
Cripplegate
,
they
entered
the
open
fields
.
<EOS>
Here
they
paused
for
a
moment
,
and
the
little
dog
ran
round
and
round
them
,
barking
gleefully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Bell
!
"
cried
the
piper
;
"
what
will
become
of
thee
when
I
am
gone
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
entrust
her
to
me
,
I
will
take
care
of
her
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
yours
,
"
rejoined
the
piper
,
in
a
voice
hoarse
with
emotion
.
"
<EOS>
Be
kind
to
her
for
my
sake
,
and
for
the
sake
of
her
unfortunate
mistress
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Since
you
have
alluded
to
your
daughter
,
"
returned
Leonard
,
"
I
must
tell
you
what
has
become
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
hitherto
mentioned
the
subject
,
fearing
it
might
distress
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
no
further
consideration
,
but
speak
out
,
"
rejoined
the
piper
.
"
<EOS>
Be
it
what
it
may
,
I
will
bear
it
like
a
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
then
briefly
recounted
all
that
had
occurred
,
describing
Nizza
's
disguise
as
a
page
,
and
her
forcible
abduction
by
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
He
was
frequently
interrupted
by
the
groans
of
his
hearer
,
who
at
last
gave
vent
to
his
rage
and
anguish
in
words
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
's
direst
curse
upon
her
ravisher
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
May
he
endure
worse
misery
than
I
now
endure
.
<EOS>
She
is
lost
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
may
yet
be
preserved
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
thinks
he
has
discovered
her
retreat
,
and
I
will
not
rest
till
I
find
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
--
<EOS>
no
,
you
will
never
find
her
,
"
replied
the
piper
,
bitterly
;
"
or
if
you
do
,
it
will
be
only
to
bewail
her
ruin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
rage
then
gave
way
to
such
an
access
of
grief
,
that
,
letting
his
head
fall
on
Leonard
's
shoulder
,
he
wept
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
secret
connected
with
that
poor
girl
,
"
he
said
,
at
length
,
controlling
his
emotion
by
a
powerful
effort
,
"
which
must
now
go
to
the
grave
with
me
.
<EOS>
The
knowledge
of
it
would
only
add
to
her
distress
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
view
the
matter
too
unfavourably
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
"
and
if
the
secret
is
of
any
moment
,
I
entreat
you
to
confide
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
If
your
worst
apprehensions
should
prove
well
founded
,
I
promise
you
it
shall
never
be
revealed
to
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
that
condition
only
,
I
will
confide
it
to
you
,
"
replied
the
piper
;
"
but
not
now
--
not
now
--
to
-
morrow
morning
,
if
I
am
alive
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
out
of
your
power
then
,
"
returned
Leonard
,
"
<EOS>
For
your
daughter
's
sake
,
I
urge
you
not
to
delay
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
for
her
sake
<EOS>
I
am
silent
,
"
rejoined
the
piper
.
<EOS>
"
Come
along
--
come
along
"
he
added
,
hurrying
forward
.
<EOS>
"
Are
we
far
from
the
pest
-
house
?
<EOS>
My
strength
is
failing
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
their
destination
,
they
were
readily
admitted
to
the
asylum
;
but
a
slight
difficulty
arose
,
which
,
however
,
was
speedily
obviated
.
<EOS>
All
the
couches
were
filled
,
but
on
examining
them
it
was
found
that
one
of
the
sick
persons
had
just
been
released
from
his
sufferings
,
and
the
body
being
removed
,
the
piper
was
allowed
to
take
its
place
.
<EOS>
Leonard
remained
by
him
for
a
short
time
,
but
,
overpowered
by
the
pestilential
effluvia
,
and
the
sight
of
so
many
miserable
objects
,
he
was
compelled
to
seek
the
open
air
.
<EOS>
Returning
,
however
,
shortly
afterwards
,
he
found
the
piper
in
a
very
perturbed
state
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
Leonard
's
voice
he
appeared
greatly
relieved
,
and
,
taking
his
gown
from
beneath
his
pillow
,
gave
it
to
him
,
and
desired
him
to
unrip
a
part
of
the
garment
,
in
which
it
was
evident
something
was
sewn
.
<EOS>
The
apprentice
complied
,
and
a
small
packet
dropped
forth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
it
,
"
said
the
piper
;
"
and
if
I
die,--and
Nizza
should
happily
be
preserved
from
her
ravisher
,
give
it
her
.
<EOS>
But
not
otherwise
--
not
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Implore
her
to
forgive
me
--
to
pity
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Forgive
you
--
her
father
?
"
cried
Leonard
,
in
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
packet
will
explain
all
,
"
replied
the
piper
in
a
troubled
tone
.
<EOS>
"
You
promised
to
take
charge
of
poor
Bell
,
"
he
added
,
drawing
forth
the
little
animal
,
who
had
crept
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
"
here
she
is
.
<EOS>
Farewell
!
<EOS>
my
faithful
friend
,
"
he
added
,
pressing
his
rough
lips
to
her
forehead
,
while
she
whined
piteously
,
as
if
beseeching
him
to
allow
her
to
remain
;
"
farewell
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
for
ever
,
I
trust
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
taking
her
gently
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
you
had
better
go
,
"
said
the
piper
.
<EOS>
"
Return
,
if
you
can
,
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will,--I
will
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
and
he
hurried
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
followed
to
the
door
by
the
young
chirurgeon
--
the
same
who
had
accompanied
Mr.
Bloundel
during
his
inspection
of
the
pest
-
house,--and
he
inquired
of
him
if
he
thought
the
piper
's
case
utterly
hopeless
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
utterly
so
,
"
replied
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
able
to
speak
more
positively
in
a
few
hours
.
<EOS>
At
present
,
I
think
,
with
care
and
attention
,
there
_
is
_
a
chance
of
his
recovery
.
"
 
<EOS>
Much
comforted
by
this
assurance
,
Leonard
departed
,
and
afraid
to
put
Bell
to
the
ground
lest
she
should
run
back
to
her
master
,
he
continued
to
carry
her
,
and
endeavoured
to
attach
her
to
him
by
caresses
and
endearments
.
<EOS>
The
little
animal
showed
her
sense
of
his
kindness
by
licking
his
hands
,
but
she
still
remained
inconsolable
,
and
ever
and
anon
struggled
to
get
free
.
<EOS>
Making
the
best
of
his
way
to
Wood
-
street
,
he
entered
the
hutch
,
and
placing
a
little
straw
in
one
corner
for
Bell
,
threw
himself
on
a
bench
and
dropped
asleep
.
<EOS>
At
six
o'clock
he
was
awakened
by
the
barking
of
the
dog
,
and
opening
the
door
beheld
Dallison
.
<EOS>
The
grocer
was
at
the
window
above
,
and
about
to
let
down
a
basket
of
provisions
to
them
.
<EOS>
To
Leonard
's
eager
inquiries
after
Amabel
,
Mr.
Bloundel
replied
by
a
melancholy
shake
of
the
head
,
and
soon
afterwards
withdrew
.
<EOS>
With
a
sad
heart
,
the
apprentice
then
broke
his
fast,--not
forgetting
at
the
same
time
the
wants
of
his
little
companion,--and
finding
he
was
not
required
by
his
master
,
he
proceeded
to
Doctor
Hodges
'
residence
.
<EOS>
He
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
the
friendly
physician
at
home
,
and
,
after
relating
to
him
what
had
occurred
,
committed
the
packet
to
his
custody
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
safer
in
your
keeping
than
mine
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
if
anything
should
happen
to
me
,
you
will
,
I
am
sure
,
observe
the
wishes
of
the
poor
piper
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Rely
upon
it
,
I
will
,
"
replied
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
tell
you
I
have
been
misled
as
to
the
clue
I
fancied
I
had
obtained
to
Nizza
's
retreat
.
<EOS>
We
are
as
far
from
the
mark
as
ever
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Might
not
the
real
name
of
the
villain
who
has
assumed
the
name
of
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
be
ascertained
from
the
Earl
of
Rochester
?
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
thought
,
"
replied
Hodges
;
"
and
I
made
the
attempt
yesterday
,
but
it
failed
.
<EOS>
I
was
at
Whitehall
,
and
finding
the
earl
in
the
king
's
presence
,
suddenly
asked
him
where
I
could
find
his
friend
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
He
looked
surprised
at
the
question
,
glanced
significantly
at
the
monarch
,
and
then
carelessly
answered
that
he
knew
no
such
person
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
strange
idea
crosses
me
,
"
cried
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
Can
it
be
the
king
who
has
assumed
this
disguise
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
one
time
I
suspected
as
much
,
"
rejoined
Hodges
;
"
but
setting
aside
your
description
of
the
person
,
which
does
not
tally
with
that
of
Charles
,
I
am
satisfied
from
other
circumstances
it
is
not
so
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
I
should
not
wonder
if
poor
Bell
,
"
smoothing
her
long
silky
ears
as
she
lay
in
the
apprentice
's
arms
,
"
should
help
us
to
discover
her
mistress
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
"
he
added
,
"
I
shall
go
to
Wood
-
street
to
inquire
after
Amabel
,
and
will
then
accompany
you
to
the
pest
-
house
.
<EOS>
From
what
you
tell
me
the
young
chirurgeon
said
of
the
piper
,
I
do
not
despair
of
his
recovery
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
as
his
chance
may
appear
,
it
is
better
,
I
fear
,
than
Amabel
's
,
"
sighed
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
Hodges
,
in
a
sorrowful
tone
<EOS>
,
"
hers
is
slight
indeed
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
perceiving
that
the
apprentice
was
greatly
moved
,
he
waited
for
a
moment
till
he
had
recovered
himself
,
and
then
,
motioning
him
to
follow
him
,
they
quitted
the
house
together
.
 
<EOS>
On
reaching
Mr.
Bloundel
's
habitation
,
Leonard
pulled
the
cord
in
the
hutch
,
and
the
grocer
appeared
at
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
daughter
has
not
left
her
bed
this
morning
,
"
he
said
,
in
answer
to
the
doctor
's
inquiries
,
"
and
I
fear
she
is
much
worse
.
<EOS>
My
wife
is
with
her
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
if
you
would
see
her
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
After
some
little
hesitation
,
Hodges
assented
,
and
was
drawn
up
as
before
.
<EOS>
He
returned
in
about
half
an
hour
,
and
his
grave
countenance
convinced
Leonard
that
his
worst
anticipations
were
correct
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
forbore
to
question
him
,
and
they
walked
towards
Cripplegate
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
On
emerging
into
the
fields
,
Hodges
observed
to
his
companion
,
"
It
is
strange
that
I
who
daily
witness
such
dreadful
suffering
should
be
pained
by
the
gradual
and
easy
decline
of
Amabel
.
<EOS>
But
so
it
is
.
<EOS>
Her
case
touches
me
more
than
the
worst
I
have
seen
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
easily
account
for
the
feeling
,
"
groaned
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
happy
to
say
I
have
prevailed
on
her
,
if
she
does
not
improve
in
a
short
time,--and
<EOS>
there
is
not
the
slightest
chance
of
it,--to
try
the
effect
of
a
removal
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
Her
father
also
consents
to
the
plan
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
But
whither
will
she
go
,
and
who
will
watch
over
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
yet
settled
,
"
rejoined
Hodges
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
that
I
might
be
permitted
to
undertake
the
office
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Leonard
,
passionately
.
 
<EOS>
"
Restrain
yourself
,
"
said
Hodges
,
in
a
tone
of
slight
rebuke
.
<EOS>
"
Fitting
attendance
will
be
found
,
if
needed
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
conversation
then
dropped
,
and
they
walked
briskly
forward
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
within
a
short
distance
of
the
pest
-
house
,
and
Leonard
,
hearing
footsteps
behind
him
,
turned
and
beheld
a
closed
litter
,
borne
by
two
stout
porters
,
and
evidently
containing
a
plague
-
patient
.
<EOS>
He
stepped
aside
to
let
it
pass
,
when
Bell
,
suddenly
pricking
her
ears
,
uttered
a
singular
cry
,
and
bursting
from
him
,
flew
after
the
litter
,
leaping
against
it
and
barking
joyfully
.
<EOS>
The
porters
,
who
were
proceeding
at
a
quick
pace
,
tried
to
drive
her
away
,
but
without
effect
,
and
she
continued
her
cries
until
they
reached
the
gates
of
the
pest
-
house
.
<EOS>
In
vain
Leonard
whistled
to
her
,
and
called
her
back
.
<EOS>
She
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
almost
begin
to
fear
,
"
said
Hodges
,
unable
to
repress
a
shudder
,
"
that
the
poor
animal
will
,
indeed
,
be
the
means
of
discovering
for
us
the
object
of
our
search
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
what
you
mean
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
,
"
and
am
of
the
same
opinion
as
yourself
.
<EOS>
Heaven
grant
we
may
be
mistaken
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
,
he
ran
forward
,
and
,
followed
by
Hodges
,
reached
the
pest
-
house
just
as
the
litter
was
taken
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Silence
that
accursed
dog
,
"
cried
one
of
the
porters
,
"
and
bid
a
nurse
attend
us
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
patient
for
the
women
's
ward
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
her
,
"
cried
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
physician
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Readily
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
porter
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
almost
over
with
her
,
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
It
would
have
saved
time
and
trouble
to
take
her
to
the
plague
-
pit
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
last
many
hours
.
<EOS>
Curse
the
dog
!
<EOS>
Will
it
never
cease
howling
?
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
here
seized
Bell
,
fearing
she
might
do
some
mischief
,
and
with
a
sad
foreboding
beheld
the
man
draw
back
the
curtains
of
the
litter
.
<EOS>
His
fears
proved
well
founded
.
<EOS>
There
,
stretched
upon
the
couch
,
with
her
dark
hair
unbound
,
and
flowing
in
wild
disorder
over
her
neck
,
lay
Nizza
Macascree
.
<EOS>
The
ghastly
paleness
of
her
face
could
not
,
however
,
entirely
rob
it
of
its
beauty
,
and
her
dark
eyes
were
glazed
and
lustreless
.
<EOS>
At
the
sight
of
her
mistress
,
poor
Bell
uttered
so
piteous
a
cry
,
that
Leonard
,
moved
by
compassion
,
placed
her
on
the
pillow
beside
her
,
and
the
sagacious
animal
did
not
attempt
to
approach
nearer
,
but
merely
licked
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
Roused
by
the
touch
,
Nizza
turned
to
see
what
was
near
her
,
and
recognising
the
animal
,
made
a
movement
to
strain
her
to
her
bosom
,
but
the
pain
she
endured
was
so
intense
that
she
sank
back
with
a
deep
groan
.
 
<EOS>
"
From
whom
did
you
receive
this
young
woman
?
"
<EOS>
demanded
Hodges
,
of
one
of
the
porters
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
was
brought
to
us
by
two
richly
-
attired
lacqueys
,
"
replied
the
man
,
"
in
this
very
litter
.
<EOS>
They
paid
us
to
carry
her
here
without
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
an
idea
whose
servants
they
were
?
"
pursued
Hodges
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
the
least
,
"
replied
the
fellow
;
"
but
I
should
judge
,
from
the
richness
of
their
dress
,
that
they
belonged
to
some
nobleman
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
they
belong
to
the
royal
household
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
rejoined
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
certain
as
to
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
poor
girl
shall
not
remain
here
,
"
observed
Hodges
,
to
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
convey
her
to
my
residence
in
Great
Knightrider
-
street
,
"
he
added
,
to
the
porters
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
convey
her
wherever
you
please
,
"
replied
the
men
,
"
if
we
are
paid
for
our
trouble
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
they
were
about
to
close
the
curtains
,
when
Nizza
,
having
caught
sight
of
the
apprentice
,
slightly
raised
herself
,
and
cried
,
in
a
voice
of
the
utmost
anxiety
,
"
<EOS>
Is
that
you
,
Leonard
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
he
replied
,
approaching
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
shall
die
happy
,
since
I
have
seen
you
once
more
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
not
stay
near
me
.
<EOS>
You
may
catch
the
infection
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nizza
,
"
said
Leonard
,
disregarding
the
caution
,
and
breathing
the
words
in
her
ear
;
"
allay
my
fears
by
a
word
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
fallen
a
victim
to
the
villain
who
carried
you
away
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
,
Leonard
,
"
she
replied
,
solemnly
,
"
I
resisted
his
importunities
,
his
threats
,
his
violence
,
and
would
have
slain
myself
rather
than
have
yielded
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
plague
,
at
length
,
came
to
my
rescue
,
and
I
have
reason
to
be
grateful
to
it
;
for
it
has
not
only
delivered
me
from
him
,
but
has
brought
me
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
now
impose
silence
upon
you
,
"
interposed
Hodges
,
laying
his
finger
on
his
lips
;
"
further
conversation
will
be
hurtful
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
One
question
more
,
and
I
have
done
,
"
replied
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
How
came
Bell
with
you
--
and
where
is
my
father
?
<EOS>
Nothing
has
happened
to
him
?
"
<EOS>
she
continued
,
observing
Leonard
's
countenance
change
.
"
<EOS>
Speak
!
<EOS>
do
not
keep
me
in
suspense
.
<EOS>
Your
silence
fills
me
with
apprehension
.
<EOS>
Speak
,
I
implore
you
.
<EOS>
He
is
dead
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
"
he
is
not
dead
--
but
he
is
an
inmate
of
this
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
Nizza
,
falling
back
senseless
upon
the
pillow
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
this
state
she
was
conveyed
with
the
greatest
expedition
to
the
doctor
's
residence
.
 
<EOS>
Leonard
only
tarried
to
visit
the
piper
,
whom
he
found
slightly
delirious
,
and
unable
to
hold
any
conversation
with
him
,
and
promising
to
return
in
the
evening
,
he
set
out
after
the
litter
.
<EOS>
Nizza
was
placed
in
the
best
apartment
of
the
doctor
's
house
,
and
attended
by
an
experienced
and
trustworthy
nurse
.
<EOS>
But
Hodges
positively
refused
to
let
Leonard
see
her
again
,
affirming
that
the
excitement
was
too
much
for
her
,
and
might
militate
against
the
chance
of
her
recovery
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
without
hopes
of
bringing
her
through
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
though
it
will
be
a
severe
struggle
,
yet
,
as
she
has
youth
and
a
good
constitution
on
her
side
,
I
do
not
despair
.
<EOS>
If
she
herself
would
second
me
,
I
should
be
yet
more
confident
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
mean
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
if
she
thought
life
worth
a
struggle
--
if
,
in
short
,
she
believed
you
would
return
her
attachment
,
she
would
rally
,
"
answered
Hodges
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
consent
to
deceive
her
thus
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
My
heart
is
fixed
elsewhere
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
heart
is
fixed
upon
one
who
will
soon
be
in
her
grave
,
"
replied
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
with
her
my
affections
will
be
buried
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
,
turning
away
to
hide
his
tears
.
 
<EOS>
So
well
was
the
doctor
's
solicitude
rewarded
,
that
three
days
after
Nizza
had
come
under
his
care
,
he
pronounced
her
out
of
danger
.
<EOS>
But
the
violence
of
the
attack
left
her
so
weak
and
exhausted
,
that
he
still
would
not
allow
an
interview
to
take
place
between
her
and
Leonard
.
<EOS>
During
all
this
time
Bell
never
left
her
side
,
and
her
presence
was
an
inexpressible
comfort
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
piper
,
too
,
was
slowly
recovering
,
and
Leonard
,
who
daily
visited
him
,
was
glad
to
learn
from
the
young
chirurgeon
that
he
would
be
able
to
leave
the
pest
-
house
shortly
.
<EOS>
Having
ascertained
from
Leonard
that
his
daughter
was
under
the
care
of
Doctor
Hodges
,
and
likely
to
do
well
,
the
piper
begged
so
earnestly
that
the
packet
might
not
be
delivered
to
her
,
that
,
after
some
consultation
with
Hodges
,
Leonard
restored
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
delighted
to
get
it
back
,
felt
it
carefully
over
to
ascertain
that
the
seals
were
unbroken
,
and
satisfied
that
all
was
safe
,
had
it
again
sewn
up
in
his
gown
,
which
he
placed
under
his
pillow
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
disclose
the
secret
to
her
by
word
of
mouth
than
in
any
other
way
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
Leonard
felt
doubtful
whether
the
secret
would
now
be
disclosed
at
all
,
but
he
made
no
remark
.
 
<EOS>
Night
was
drawing
on
as
he
quitted
the
pest
-
house
,
and
he
determined
to
take
this
opportunity
of
visiting
the
great
plague
-
pit
,
which
lay
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
,
in
a
line
with
the
church
of
All
-
Hallows
-
in
-
the
-
Wall
,
and
he
accordingly
proceeded
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
The
pit
which
he
was
about
to
visit
was
about
forty
feet
long
,
twenty
wide
,
and
the
like
number
deep
.
<EOS>
Into
this
tremendous
chasm
the
dead
were
promiscuously
thrown
,
without
regard
to
sex
or
condition
,
generally
stripped
of
their
clothing
,
and
covered
with
a
slight
layer
of
earth
and
quick
lime
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
was
setting
as
Leonard
walked
towards
this
dismal
place
,
and
he
thought
he
had
never
witnessed
so
magnificent
a
sight
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
was
remarked
that
at
this
fatal
season
the
sunsets
were
unusually
splendid
.
<EOS>
The
glorious
orb
sank
slowly
behind
Saint
Paul
's
,
which
formed
a
prominent
object
in
the
view
from
the
fields
,
and
threw
out
its
central
tower
,
its
massive
roof
,
and
the
two
lesser
towers
flanking
the
portico
,
into
strong
relief
.
<EOS>
Leonard
gazed
at
the
mighty
fabric
,
which
seemed
dilated
to
twice
its
size
by
this
light
,
and
wondered
whether
it
was
possible
that
it
could
ever
be
destroyed
,
as
predicted
by
Solomon
Eagle
.
 
<EOS>
Long
after
the
sun
had
set
,
the
sky
was
stained
with
crimson
,
and
the
grey
walls
of
the
city
were
tinged
with
rosy
radiance
.
<EOS>
The
heat
was
intense
,
and
Leonard
,
to
cool
himself
,
sat
down
in
the
thick
grass
--
for
,
though
the
crops
were
ready
for
the
scythe
,
no
mowers
could
be
found
--
and
,
gazing
upwards
,
strove
to
mount
in
spirit
from
the
tainted
earth
towards
heaven
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
he
arose
,
and
proceeded
towards
the
plague
-
pit
.
<EOS>
The
grass
was
trampled
down
near
it
,
and
there
were
marks
of
frequent
cart
-
wheels
upon
the
sod
.
<EOS>
Great
heaps
of
soil
,
thrown
out
of
the
excavation
,
lay
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
Holding
a
handkerchief
steeped
in
vinegar
to
his
face
,
Leonard
ventured
to
the
brink
of
the
pit
.
<EOS>
But
even
this
precaution
could
not
counteract
the
horrible
effluvia
arising
from
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
more
than
half
filled
with
dead
bodies
;
and
through
the
putrid
and
heaving
mass
many
disjointed
limbs
and
ghastly
faces
could
be
discerned
,
the
long
hair
of
women
and
the
tiny
arms
of
children
appearing
on
the
surface
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
horrible
sight
--
so
horrible
,
that
it
possessed
a
fascination
peculiar
to
itself
,
and
,
in
spite
of
his
loathing
,
Leonard
lingered
to
gaze
at
it
.
<EOS>
Strange
and
fantastic
thoughts
possessed
him
.
<EOS>
He
fancied
that
the
legs
and
arms
moved
--
that
the
eyes
of
some
of
the
corpses
opened
and
glared
at
him
--
and
that
the
whole
rotting
mass
was
endowed
with
animation
.
<EOS>
So
appalled
was
he
by
this
idea
that
he
turned
away
,
and
at
that
moment
beheld
a
vehicle
approaching
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
dead
-
cart
,
charged
with
a
heavy
load
to
increase
the
already
redundant
heap
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
inexplicable
and
irresistible
feelings
of
curiosity
that
induced
Leonard
to
continue
gazing
upon
the
loathly
objects
in
the
pit
,
now
prompted
him
to
stay
and
see
what
would
ensue
.
<EOS>
Two
persons
were
with
the
cart
,
and
one
of
them
,
to
Leonard
's
infinite
surprise
and
disgust
,
proved
to
be
Chowles
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
time
,
however
,
for
the
expression
of
any
sentiment
,
for
the
cart
halted
at
a
little
distance
from
him
,
when
its
conductors
,
turning
it
round
,
backed
it
towards
the
edge
of
the
pit
.
<EOS>
The
horse
was
then
taken
out
,
and
Chowles
calling
to
Leonard
,
the
latter
involuntarily
knelt
down
to
guide
its
descent
,
while
the
other
assistant
,
who
had
proceeded
to
the
further
side
of
the
chasm
,
threw
the
light
of
a
lantern
full
upon
the
grisly
load
,
which
was
thus
shot
into
the
gulf
below
.
 
<EOS>
Shovelling
a
sufficient
quantity
of
earth
and
lime
into
the
pit
to
cover
the
bodies
,
Chowles
and
his
companion
departed
,
leaving
Leonard
alone
.
<EOS>
He
continued
there
a
few
moments
longer
,
and
was
about
to
follow
them
,
when
a
prolonged
and
piercing
cry
smote
his
ear
;
and
,
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
,
he
perceived
a
figure
running
with
great
swiftness
towards
the
pit
.
<EOS>
As
no
pursuers
appeared
,
Leonard
could
scarcely
doubt
that
this
was
one
of
the
distracted
persons
he
had
heard
of
,
who
,
in
the
frenzy
produced
by
the
intolerable
anguish
of
their
sores
,
would
often
rush
to
the
plague
-
pit
and
bury
themselves
,
and
he
therefore
resolved
,
if
possible
,
to
prevent
the
fatal
attempt
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
placed
himself
in
the
way
of
the
runner
,
and
endeavoured
,
with
outstretched
arms
,
to
stop
him
.
<EOS>
But
the
latter
dashed
him
aside
with
great
violence
,
and
hurrying
to
the
brink
of
the
pit
,
uttered
a
fearful
cry
,
and
exclaiming
,
<EOS>
"
She
is
here
!
<EOS>
she
is
here!--I
shall
find
her
amongst
them!"--flung
himself
into
the
abyss
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
could
shake
off
the
horror
inspired
by
this
dreadful
action
,
Leonard
ran
to
the
pit
,
and
,
gazing
into
it
,
beheld
him
by
the
imperfect
light
struggling
in
the
horrible
mass
in
which
he
was
partially
immersed
.
<EOS>
The
frenzied
man
had
now
,
however
,
begun
to
repent
his
rashness
,
and
cried
out
for
aid
.
<EOS>
But
this
Leonard
found
it
impossible
to
afford
him
;
and
,
seeing
he
must
speedily
perish
if
left
to
himself
,
he
ran
after
the
dead
-
cart
,
and
overtaking
it
just
as
it
reached
Moor
-
gate
,
informed
Chowles
what
had
happened
,
and
begged
him
to
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
will
be
no
use
in
helping
him
out
,
"
rejoined
Chowles
,
in
a
tone
of
indifference
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
to
take
him
back
in
a
couple
of
hours
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
--
let
him
remain
where
he
is
.
<EOS>
There
is
scarcely
a
night
that
some
crazy
being
does
not
destroy
himself
in
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
We
never
concern
ourselves
about
such
persons
except
to
strip
them
of
their
apparel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Unfeeling
wretch
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Leonard
,
unable
to
restrain
his
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Give
me
your
fork
,
and
I
will
pull
him
out
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
surrendering
the
implement
,
Chowles
flourished
it
over
his
head
with
the
intention
of
striking
the
apprentice
,
but
the
latter
nimbly
avoided
the
blow
,
and
snatching
it
from
his
grasp
,
ran
back
to
the
plague
-
pit
.
<EOS>
He
was
followed
by
Chowles
and
the
burier
,
who
threatened
him
with
loud
oaths
.
<EOS>
Regardless
of
their
menaces
,
Leonard
fixed
the
hook
in
the
dress
of
the
struggling
man
,
and
exerting
all
his
strength
,
drew
him
out
of
the
abyss
.
<EOS>
He
had
just
lodged
him
in
safety
on
the
brink
when
Chowles
and
his
companion
came
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
Keep
off
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Leonard
,
brandishing
his
fork
as
he
spoke
;
"
you
shall
neither
commit
robbery
nor
murder
here
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
assist
this
unfortunate
gentleman
,
I
have
no
doubt
you
will
be
well
rewarded
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
get
hence
,
or
advance
at
your
peril
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
returned
Chowles
,
who
began
to
fancy
something
might
be
made
of
the
matter
,
"
if
you
think
we
should
be
rewarded
,
we
would
convey
the
gentleman
back
to
his
own
home
<EOS>
provided
we
can
ascertain
where
it
is
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
afraid
he
may
die
on
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
you
can
apply
to
his
friends
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
He
must
not
be
abandoned
thus
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
First
,
let
us
know
who
he
is
,
"
returned
Chowles
.
<EOS>
"
Is
he
able
to
speak
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
,
"
answered
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
Bring
the
lantern
this
way
,
and
let
us
examine
his
countenance
.
"
 
<EOS>
Chowles
complied
,
and
held
the
light
over
the
unfortunate
person
.
<EOS>
His
attire
was
rich
,
but
in
great
disorder
,
and
sullied
by
the
loathsome
mass
in
which
he
had
been
plunged
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
flower
of
youth
,
and
his
features
must
have
been
remarkable
for
their
grace
and
beauty
,
but
they
were
now
of
a
livid
hue
,
and
swollen
and
distorted
by
pain
.
<EOS>
Still
Leonard
recognised
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gracious
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
!
"
echoed
Chowles
.
<EOS>
"
By
all
that
's
wonderful
,
so
it
is
!
<EOS>
Here
is
a
lucky
chance
!
<EOS>
Bring
the
dead
-
cart
hither
,
Jonas
--
quick
,
quick
!
<EOS>
I
shall
put
him
under
the
care
of
Judith
Malmayns
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
the
burier
hurried
off
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Had
I
known
who
it
was
,
"
exclaimed
Leonard
,
gazing
with
abhorrence
at
the
miserable
object
before
him
,
"
I
would
have
left
him
to
die
the
death
he
so
richly
merits
!
"
 
<EOS>
A
deep
groan
broke
from
the
sufferer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
no
fear
,
Sir
Paul
,
"
said
Chowles
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
good
hands
.
<EOS>
Every
care
shall
be
taken
of
you
,
and
you
shall
be
cured
by
Judith
Malmayns
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
shall
not
come
near
me
,
"
rejoined
Parravicin
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
take
care
of
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
in
an
imploring
tone
,
to
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
appeal
in
vain
to
me
,
"
rejoined
the
apprentice
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
justly
punished
for
your
treatment
of
Nizza
Macascree
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
--
I
am
,
"
groaned
Parravicin
,
"
but
she
will
be
speedily
avenged
.
<EOS>
I
shall
soon
join
her
in
that
pit
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
there
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
bitterly
,
"
She
is
fast
recovering
from
the
plague
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
she
not
dead
?
"
demanded
Parravicin
,
with
frightful
eagerness
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
told
she
was
thrown
into
that
horrible
chasm
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
were
deceived
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
taken
to
the
pest
-
house
by
your
orders
,
and
would
have
perished
if
she
had
not
found
a
friend
to
aid
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
now
out
of
danger
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
no
longer
desire
to
die
,
"
cried
Parravicin
,
desperately
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
live
--
live
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
delude
yourself
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
coldly
;
"
you
have
little
chance
of
recovery
,
and
should
employ
the
short
time
left
you
in
praying
to
Heaven
for
forgiveness
of
your
sins
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Tush
!
"
exclaimed
Parravicin
,
fiercely
<EOS>
,
"
I
shall
not
weary
Heaven
with
ineffectual
supplications
.
<EOS>
I
well
know
I
am
past
all
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
No
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
fearful
imprecation
,
"
since
Nizza
is
alive
,
I
will
not
die
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Right
,
Sir
Paul
,
right
,
"
rejoined
Chowles
<EOS>
;
"
put
a
bold
face
on
it
,
and
I
will
answer
for
it
you
will
get
over
the
attack
.
<EOS>
Have
no
fear
of
Judith
Malmayns
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
significant
tone
.
"
<EOS>
However
she
may
treat
others
,
she
will
cure
_
you
_
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
it
worth
her
while
to
do
so
,
"
rejoined
Parravicin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
is
the
cart
,
"
cried
Chowles
,
seeing
the
vehicle
approach
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
you
in
the
first
place
to
Saint
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
Judith
must
see
you
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Take
me
where
you
please
,
"
rejoined
Parravicin
,
faintly
;
"
and
remember
what
I
have
said
.
<EOS>
If
I
die
,
the
nurse
will
get
nothing
--
if
I
am
cured
,
she
shall
be
proportionately
rewarded
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
forget
it
,
"
replied
Chowles
.
<EOS>
And
with
the
help
of
Jonas
he
placed
the
knight
carefully
in
the
cart
.
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
trouble
yourself
further
about
him
,
"
he
added
to
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Before
be
quits
this
place
<EOS>
I
must
know
who
he
is
,
"
rejoined
the
latter
,
placing
himself
at
the
horse
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
his
name
as
well
as
I
do
,
"
replied
Chowles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Parravicin
is
not
his
real
name
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Chowles
,
"
this
is
news
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
no
matter
who
he
is
,
he
is
rich
enough
to
pay
well
.
<EOS>
So
stand
aside
,
and
let
us
go
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
time
to
waste
in
further
parleying
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
move
till
my
question
is
answered
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
see
to
that
,
"
said
Jonas
,
approaching
him
behind
,
and
dealing
him
so
severe
a
blow
on
the
head
that
he
stretched
him
senseless
on
the
ground
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
we
throw
him
into
the
pit
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
to
Chowles
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
hesitated
for
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
"
No
,
no
,
it
is
not
worth
while
.
<EOS>
It
may
bring
us
into
trouble
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
time
to
lose
.
"
<EOS>
And
they
then
put
the
cart
in
motion
,
and
took
the
way
to
Saint
Paul
's
.
 
<EOS>
On
coming
to
himself
,
Leonard
had
some
difficulty
in
recalling
what
had
happened
;
and
when
the
whole
train
of
circumstances
rushed
upon
his
mind
,
he
congratulated
himself
that
he
had
escaped
further
injury
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
think
of
the
hands
I
have
been
placed
in
,
"
he
murmured
,
"
I
can
not
but
be
grateful
that
they
did
not
throw
me
into
the
pit
,
where
no
discovery
could
have
been
made
as
to
how
I
came
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
rest
till
I
have
ascertained
the
name
and
rank
of
Nizza
's
persecutor
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
they
have
taken
him
to
Saint
Paul
's
,
and
will
proceed
thither
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
he
hastened
towards
the
nearest
city
gate
,
and
passing
towards
it
,
shaped
his
course
towards
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
starlight
night
,
and
though
there
was
no
moon
,
the
myriad
lustres
glowing
in
the
deep
and
cloudless
vault
rendered
every
object
plainly
distinguishable
.
<EOS>
At
this
hour
,
little
restraint
was
placed
upon
the
sick
,
and
they
wandered
about
the
streets
uttering
dismal
cries
.
<EOS>
Some
would
fling
themselves
upon
bulks
or
steps
,
where
they
were
not
unfrequently
found
the
next
morning
bereft
of
life
.
<EOS>
Most
of
those
not
attacked
by
the
distemper
kept
close
house
;
but
there
were
some
few
reckless
beings
who
passed
the
night
in
the
wildest
revelry
,
braving
the
fate
awaiting
them
.
<EOS>
As
Leonard
passed
Saint
Michael
's
church
,
in
Basinghall
-
street
,
he
perceived
,
to
his
great
surprise
,
that
it
was
lighted
up
,
and
at
first
supposed
some
service
was
going
on
within
it
,
but
on
approaching
he
heard
strains
of
lively
and
most
irreverent
music
issuing
from
within
.
<EOS>
Pushing
open
the
door
,
he
entered
the
sacred
edifice
,
and
found
it
occupied
by
a
party
of
twenty
young
men
,
accompanied
by
a
like
number
of
females
,
some
of
whom
were
playing
at
dice
and
cards
,
some
drinking
,
<EOS>
others
singing
Bacchanalian
melodies
,
others
dancing
along
the
aisles
to
the
notes
of
a
theorbo
and
spinet
.
<EOS>
Leonard
was
so
inexpressibly
shocked
by
what
he
beheld
,
that
unable
to
contain
himself
<EOS>
he
mounted
the
steps
of
the
pulpit
,
and
called
to
them
in
a
loud
voice
to
desist
from
their
scandalous
conduct
,
and
no
longer
profane
the
house
of
God
.
<EOS>
But
they
treated
his
remonstrances
with
laughter
and
derision
,
and
some
of
the
party
forming
themselves
into
a
group
round
the
pulpit
,
entreated
him
to
preach
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
want
a
little
variety
,
"
said
one
of
the
group
,
a
good
-
looking
young
man
,
upon
whom
the
wine
had
evidently
made
some
impression--"we
are
tired
of
drinking
and
play
,
and
may
as
well
listen
to
a
sermon
,
especially
an
original
one
.
<EOS>
Hold
forth
to
us
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
I
would
,
hold
forth
till
daybreak
,
if
I
thought
it
would
produce
any
impression
,
"
returned
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
perceive
you
are
too
hardened
to
be
aroused
to
repentance
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Repentance
!
"
cried
another
of
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
whom
you
address
?
<EOS>
These
gentlemen
are
the
Brotherhood
of
Saint
Michael
,
and
I
am
the
principal
.
<EOS>
We
are
determined
to
enjoy
the
few
days
or
hours
we
may
have
left
--
that
is
all
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
afraid
of
the
future
,
and
are
resolved
to
make
the
most
of
the
present
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
"
cried
the
others
,
with
a
great
shout
of
laughter
,
which
,
however
,
was
interrupted
by
a
cry
of
anguish
from
one
of
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
another
person
seized
,
"
said
the
principal
;
"
take
him
away
,
brothers
.
<EOS>
This
is
owing
to
listening
to
a
sermon
.
<EOS>
Let
us
return
to
our
wine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
not
accept
this
awful
warning
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
all
share
your
companion
's
fate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
anticipate
nothing
else
,
"
returned
the
principal
;
"
and
are
therefore
resolved
to
banish
reflection
.
<EOS>
A
week
ago
,
the
Brotherhood
of
Saint
Michael
consisted
of
forty
persons
.
<EOS>
We
are
already
diminished
to
half
the
number
,
but
are
not
the
less
merry
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
we
are
more
jovial
than
ever
.
<EOS>
We
have
agreed
that
whoever
shall
be
seized
with
the
distemper
,
shall
be
instantly
conveyed
to
the
pest
-
house
,
so
that
the
hilarity
of
the
others
shall
not
be
interrupted
.
<EOS>
The
poor
fellow
who
has
just
been
attacked
has
left
behind
him
a
beautiful
mistress
.
<EOS>
She
is
yours
if
you
choose
to
join
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
stop
with
us
,
"
cried
a
young
and
very
pretty
woman
,
taking
his
hand
and
drawing
him
towards
the
company
who
were
dancing
beneath
the
aisles
.
 
<EOS>
But
Leonard
disengaged
himself
,
and
hurried
away
amid
the
laughter
and
hootings
of
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
The
streets
,
despite
their
desolate
appearance
,
were
preferable
to
the
spot
he
had
just
quitted
,
and
he
seemed
to
breathe
more
freely
when
he
got
to
a
little
distance
from
the
polluted
fane
.
<EOS>
He
had
now
entered
Wood
-
street
,
but
all
was
as
still
as
death
,
and
he
paused
to
gaze
up
at
his
master
's
window
,
but
there
was
no
one
at
it
.
<EOS>
Many
a
lover
,
unable
to
behold
the
object
of
his
affections
,
has
in
some
measure
satisfied
the
yearning
of
his
heart
by
gazing
at
her
dwelling
,
and
feeling
he
was
near
her
.
<EOS>
Many
a
sad
heart
has
been
cheered
by
beholding
a
light
at
a
window
,
or
a
shadow
on
its
closed
curtains
,
and
such
would
have
been
Leonard
's
feelings
if
he
had
not
been
depressed
by
the
thought
of
Amabel
's
precarious
state
of
health
.
 
<EOS>
While
thus
wrapt
in
mournful
thought
,
he
observed
three
figures
slowly
approaching
from
the
further
end
of
the
street
,
and
he
instinctively
withdrew
into
a
doorway
.
<EOS>
He
had
reason
to
congratulate
himself
upon
the
precaution
,
as
,
when
the
party
drew
nearer
,
he
recognised
,
with
a
pang
that
shot
to
his
heart
,
the
voice
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
A
moment
's
observation
from
his
place
of
concealment
showed
him
that
the
earl
was
accompanied
by
Sir
George
Etherege
and
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
They
paused
within
a
short
distance
of
him
,
and
he
could
distinctly
hear
their
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
yet
told
us
why
you
brought
us
here
my
lord
,
"
said
Etherege
to
Rochester
,
after
the
latter
had
gazed
for
a
few
moments
in
silence
at
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
resolved
to
make
another
attempt
to
carry
off
the
girl
--
and
failing
in
it
,
to
give
her
up
for
ever
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
guessed
my
purpose
precisely
,
"
returned
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
has
informed
a
friend
of
mine
that
the
pretty
Amabel
has
fallen
into
a
decline
.
<EOS>
The
poor
soul
is
,
doubtless
,
pining
for
me
;
and
it
would
be
the
height
of
inhumanity
to
let
her
perish
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
ground
his
teeth
-
with
suppressed
rage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
mean
to
make
her
Countess
of
Rochester
,
after
all
,
"
laughed
Etherege
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
had
determined
to
carry
off
Mistress
Mallett
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Old
Bowley
declares
he
will
send
me
to
the
Tower
if
I
do
,
"
replied
Rochester
;
"
and
though
his
threats
would
scarcely
deter
me
from
acting
as
I
think
proper
,
I
have
no
inclination
for
marriage
at
present
.
<EOS>
What
a
pity
,
Etherege
,
that
one
can
not
in
these
affairs
have
the
money
oneself
,
and
give
the
wife
to
one
's
friend
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
easily
accomplished
,
"
replied
Etherege
,
laughingly
;
"
especially
where
you
have
a
friend
so
devoted
as
myself
.
<EOS>
But
do
you
mean
to
carry
off
Amabel
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
now
we
come
to
business
,
"
interposed
Pillichody
.
"
<EOS>
Bolts
and
barricadoes
!
<EOS>
your
lordship
has
only
to
say
the
word
,
and
I
will
break
into
the
house
,
and
bear
her
off
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
former
conduct
is
a
good
guarantee
for
your
present
success
,
truly
,
"
returned
Rochester
,
with
a
sneer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
;
I
shall
postpone
my
design
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
I
have
ascertained
,
from
the
source
<EOS>
whence
<EOS>
I
obtained
information
of
Amabel
's
illness
,
that
she
is
to
be
removed
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
This
will
exactly
suit
my
purpose
,
and
put
her
completely
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
nothing
is
to
be
done
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
said
Pillichody
,
secretly
congratulating
himself
on
his
escape
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
my
sword
!
<EOS>
I
feel
equal
to
the
most
desperate
attempt
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Your
courage
and
dexterity
must
be
reserved
for
some
more
favourable
occasion
,
"
replied
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
not
to
carry
off
the
girl
,
I
must
again
inquire
why
your
lordship
has
come
hither
?
"
demanded
Etherege
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
frank
with
you
,
my
sole
motive
was
to
gaze
at
the
house
that
contains
her
,
"
replied
Rochester
,
in
a
voice
that
bespoke
his
sincerity
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
before
told
you
that
she
has
a
strong
hold
upon
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
her
for
some
weeks
,
and
during
that
time
have
endeavoured
to
obliterate
her
image
by
making
love
to
a
dozen
others
.
<EOS>
But
it
will
not
do
.
<EOS>
She
still
continues
absolute
mistress
of
my
affections
.
<EOS>
I
sometimes
think
,
if
I
can
obtain
her
in
no
other
way
,
I
shall
be
rash
enough
to
marry
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
this
must
never
be
,
"
said
Etherege
.
 
<EOS>
"
Were
I
to
lose
her
altogether
,
I
should
be
inconsolable
,
"
cried
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
inconsolable
as
I
am
for
the
rich
widow
of
Watling
-
street
,
who
died
a
fortnight
ago
of
the
plague
,
and
left
her
wealth
to
her
footman
,
"
replied
Pillichody
,
drawing
forth
his
handkerchief
and
applying
it
to
his
eyes--"oh
!
<EOS>
oh
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Silence
,
fool
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rochester
:
"
I
am
in
no
mood
for
buffoonery
.
<EOS>
If
you
shed
tears
for
any
one
,
it
should
be
for
your
master
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
I
am
grieved
for
him
,
"
replied
Pillichody
;
"
but
I

<EOS>
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
,
as
he
chooses
to
be
called
,
is
my
patron
,
not
my
master
.
<EOS>
He
permits
me
a
very
close
familiarity
,
not
to
say
friendship
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
your
patron
,
"
rejoined
Rochester
,
scornfully
.
<EOS>
"
How
is
he
going
on
to
-
night
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
feared
to
tell
your
lordship
,
"
replied
Pillichody
,
"
lest
it
should
spoil
your
mirth
;
but
he
broke
out
of
his
chamber
a
few
hours
ago
,
and
has
not
been
discovered
since
.
<EOS>
Most
likely
,
he
will
be
found
in
the
plague
-
pit
or
the
Thames
in
the
morning
,
for
he
was
in
such
an
infuriated
state
,
that
it
is
the
opinion
of
his
attendants
he
would
certainly
destroy
himself
.
<EOS>
You
know
he
was
attacked
two
days
after
Nizza
Macascree
was
seized
by
the
pestilence
,
and
his
brain
has
been
running
upon
the
poor
girl
ever
since
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
"
exclaimed
Rochester
,
"
it
is
a
sad
end
.
<EOS>
I
am
wearied
of
this
infected
city
,
and
shall
be
heartily
glad
to
quit
it
.
<EOS>
A
few
months
in
the
country
with
Amabel
will
be
enchanting
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
_
Apropos
_
of
melancholy
subjects
,
"
said
Etherege
,
"
<EOS>
your
masque
of
the
Dance
of
Death
has
caused
great
consternation
at
court
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Stewart
declares
she
can
not
get
that
strange
fellow
who
performed
such
fantastic
tricks
in
the
skeleton
-
dance
out
of
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
mean
Chowles
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
a
singular
being
,
certainly
--
once
a
coffin
-
maker
,
and
now
,
I
believe
,
a
burier
of
the
dead
.
<EOS>
He
takes
up
his
abode
in
a
crypt
of
Saint
Faith
's
and
leads
an
incomprehensible
life
.
<EOS>
As
we
return
we
shall
pass
the
cathedral
,
and
can
see
whether
he
is
astir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Readily
,
"
replied
Etherege
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
desire
to
tarry
here
longer
,
or
shall
we
proceed
before
you
,
while
you
indulge
your
tender
meditations
undisturbed
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
me
,
"
replied
Rochester
;
"
I
shall
be
glad
to
be
alone
for
a
few
moments
.
"
 
<EOS>
Etherege
and
Pillichody
then
proceeded
slowly
towards
Cheapside
,
while
the
earl
remained
with
his
arms
folded
upon
his
breast
,
and
his
gaze
fixed
upon
the
house
.
<EOS>
Leonard
watched
him
with
intense
curiosity
,
and
had
great
difficulty
in
controlling
himself
.
<EOS>
Though
the
earl
was
armed
,
while
he
had
only
his
staff
,
he
could
have
easily
mastered
him
by
assailing
him
unawares
.
<EOS>
But
Leonard
's
generous
nature
revolted
at
the
unworthy
suggestion
,
and
he
resolved
,
if
he
attacked
him
at
all
,
to
give
him
time
to
stand
upon
his
guard
.
<EOS>
A
moment
's
reflection
,
however
,
satisfied
him
that
his
wisest
course
would
be
to
remain
concealed
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
in
possession
of
the
earl
's
plan
,
and
,
with
the
help
of
Doctor
Hodges
,
could
easily
defeat
it
;
whereas
if
he
appeared
,
it
would
be
evident
that
he
had
overheard
what
had
passed
,
and
some
other
scheme
,
to
which
he
could
not
be
privy
,
would
be
necessarily
adopted
.
<EOS>
Influenced
by
this
consideration
,
he
suffered
the
earl
to
depart
unmolested
,
and
when
he
had
got
to
some
distance
followed
him
.
<EOS>
Rochester
's
companions
were
waiting
for
him
in
Cheapside
,
and
,
joining
them
,
they
all
three
proceeded
towards
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
They
entered
the
great
northern
door
;
and
Leonard
,
who
was
now
well
acquainted
with
all
the
approaches
,
passed
through
the
door
at
the
north
side
of
the
choir
,
to
which
he
had
been
directed
on
a
former
occasion
by
Solomon
Eagle
.
<EOS>
He
found
the
party
guided
by
the
old
verger
--
the
only
one
of
its
former
keepers
who
still
lingered
about
the
place
--
and
preparing
to
descend
to
Saint
Faith
's
.
<EOS>
Leonard
followed
as
near
as
he
could
without
exposing
himself
,
and
,
on
gaining
the
subterranean
church
,
easily
contrived
to
screen
himself
behind
the
ponderous
ranks
of
pillars
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
they
had
reached
the
door
of
the
charnel
It
was
closed
;
but
Rochester
knocked
against
it
,
and
Chowles
presently
appeared
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
greatly
surprised
at
seeing
the
earl
,
nor
was
the
latter
less
astonished
when
he
learnt
that
Parravicin
was
within
the
vault
.
<EOS>
He
desired
to
be
shown
to
his
friend
,
and
Chowles
ushered
him
into
the
crypt
.
<EOS>
Leonard
would
have
followed
them
;
but
as
Etherege
and
the
others
declined
entering
the
charnel
,
and
remained
at
the
door
,
he
could
not
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
Shortly
after
this
the
sick
man
was
brought
out
,
stretched
upon
a
pallet
,
borne
by
Chowles
and
Judith
;
and
the
party
proceeded
slowly
,
and
occasionally
relieving
each
other
,
to
the
great
western
entrance
,
where
a
coach
being
procured
by
Pillichody
,
Parravicin
was
placed
within
it
,
with
Judith
and
Chowles
;
and
orders
being
given
in
an
under
-
tone
to
the
driver
,
he
departed
.
<EOS>
The
others
then
proceeded
towards
Ludgate
,
while
Leonard
,
again
disappointed
,
retraced
his
steps
to
Wood
-
street
.

HOW
SAINT
PATHOS
WAS
USED
AS
A
PEST
-
HOUSE
.
 
<EOS>
The
distemper
had
by
this
time
increased
to
such
a
frightful
extent
,
that
the
pest
-
houses
being
found
wholly
inadequate
to
contain
the
number
of
sick
persons
sent
to
them
,
it
was
resolved
by
the
civic
authorities
,
who
had
obtained
the
sanction
of
the
Dean
and
Chapter
of
Saint
Paul
's
for
that
purpose
,
to
convert
the
cathedral
into
a
receptacle
for
the
infected
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
a
meeting
was
held
in
the
Convocation
House
to
make
final
arrangements
.
<EOS>
It
was
attended
by
Sir
John
Lawrence
,
the
Lord
Mayor
;
by
Sir
George
Waterman
,
and
Sir
Charles
Doe
,
sheriffs
;
by
Doctor
Sheldon
,
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
;
by
the
Duke
of
Albemarle
,
the
Earl
of
Craven
,
and
,
a
few
other
zealous
and
humane
persons
.
<EOS>
Several
members
of
the
College
of
Physicians
were
likewise
present
,
and
,
amongst
others
,
Doctor
Hodges
;
and
the
expediency
of
the
measure
being
fully
agreed
upon
,
it
was
determined
to
carry
it
into
immediate
execution
.
 
<EOS>
The
cloisters
surrounding
the
Convocation
House
were
crowded
with
sick
persons
,
drawn
thither
by
the
rumour
of
what
was
going
forward
;
and
when
the
meeting
adjourned
to
the
cathedral
,
these
unfortunate
beings
followed
them
,
and
were
with
some
difficulty
kept
aloof
from
the
uninfected
by
the
attendants
.
<EOS>
A
very
earnest
and
touching
address
was
next
pronounced
by
the
archbishop
.
<EOS>
Calling
upon
his
hearers
to
look
upon
themselves
as
already
dead
to
the
world,--to
regard
the
present
visitation
as
a
just
punishment
of
their
sins
,
and
to
rejoice
that
their
sufferings
would
be
so
soon
terminated
,
when
,
if
they
sincerely
and
heartily
repented
,
they
would
at
once
be
transported
from
the
depths
of
wretchedness
and
misery
to
regions
of
unfading
bliss
;
he
concluded
by
stating
that
he
,
and
all
those
around
him
,
were
prepared
to
devote
themselves
,
without
regard
to
their
own
safety
,
to
the
preservation
of
their
fellow
-
citizens
,
and
that
they
would
leave
nothing
undone
to
stop
the
ravages
of
the
devouring
scourge
.
 
<EOS>
It
chanced
that
Leonard
Holt
was
present
on
this
occasion
,
and
as
he
listened
to
the
eloquent
discourse
of
the
archbishop
,
and
gazed
at
the
group
around
him
,
all
equally
zealous
in
the
good
cause
,
and
equally
regardless
of
themselves
,
he
could
not
but
indulge
a
hope
that
their
exertions
might
be
crowned
with
success
.
<EOS>
It
was
indeed
a
touching
sight
to
see
the
melancholy
congregation
to
whom
his
address
was
delivered
--
many
,
nay
most
of
whom
were
on
the
verge
of
dissolution;--and
<EOS>
Leonard
Holt
was
so
moved
by
the
almost
apostolic
fervour
of
the
prelate
,
<EOS>
that
,
but
for
the
thought
of
Amabel
,
he
might
have
followed
the
example
of
several
of
the
auditors
,
and
devoted
himself
altogether
to
the
service
of
the
sick
.
 
<EOS>
His
discourse
concluded
,
the
archbishop
and
most
of
his
companions
quitted
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
Hodges
,
however
,
and
three
of
the
physicians
,
remained
behind
to
superintend
the
necessary
preparations
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
,
a
large
number
of
pallets
were
brought
in
,
and
ranged
along
the
nave
and
aisles
at
short
distances
from
each
other
;
and
,
before
night
,
the
interior
of
the
structure
presented
the
complete
appearance
of
an
hospital
.
<EOS>
Acting
under
the
directions
of
Doctor
Hodges
,
Leonard
Holt
lent
his
assistance
in
arranging
the
pallets
,
in
covering
them
with
bedding
and
blankets
,
and
in
executing
any
other
service
required
of
him
.
<EOS>
A
sufficient
number
of
chirurgeons
and
nurses
were
then
sent
for
,
and
such
was
the
expedition
used
,
that
on
that
very
night
most
of
the
pallets
were
occupied
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
cathedral
underwent
another
afflicting
change
.
<EOS>
A
blight
had
come
over
it
,
mildewing
its
holy
walls
,
and
tainting
and
polluting
its
altars
.
<EOS>
Its
aisles
,
once
trodden
by
grave
and
reverend
ecclesiastics
,
and
subsequently
haunted
by
rufflers
,
bullies
,
and
other
worthless
characters
,
were
now
filled
with
miserable
wretches
,
stricken
with
a
loathsome
and
fatal
distemper
.
<EOS>
Its
chapels
and
shrines
formerly
adorned
with
rich
sculptures
and
costly
ornaments
,
but
stripped
of
them
at
times
when
they
were
looked
upon
as
idolatrous
and
profane
,
were
now
occupied
by
nurses
,
chirurgeons
,
and
their
attendants
;
while
every
niche
and
corner
was
filled
with
surgical
implements
,
phials
,
drugs
,
poultices
,
foul
rags
,
and
linen
.
 
<EOS>
In
less
than
a
week
after
it
had
been
converted
into
a
pest
-
house
,
the
cathedral
was
crowded
to
overflowing
.
<EOS>
Upwards
of
three
hundred
pallets
were
set
up
in
the
nave
,
in
the
aisles
,
in
the
transepts
,
and
in
the
choir
,
and
even
in
the
chapels
.
<EOS>
But
these
proving
insufficient
,
many
poor
wretches
who
were
brought
thither
were
placed
on
the
cold
flags
,
and
protected
only
by
a
single
blanket
.
<EOS>
At
night
the
scene
was
really
terrific
.
<EOS>
The
imperfect
light
borne
by
the
attendants
fell
on
the
couches
,
and
revealed
the
livid
countenances
of
their
occupants
;
while
the
vaulted
roof
rang
with
shrieks
and
groans
<EOS>
so
horrible
and
heart
-
piercing
as
to
be
scarcely
endured
,
except
by
those
whose
nerves
were
firmly
strung
,
or
had
become
blunted
by
their
constant
recurrence
.
<EOS>
At
such
times
,
too
,
some
unhappy
creature
,
frenzied
by
agony
,
would
burst
from
his
couch
,
and
rend
the
air
with
his
cries
,
until
overtaken
and
overpowered
by
his
attendants
.
<EOS>
On
one
occasion
,
it
happened
that
a
poor
wretch
,
who
had
been
thus
caught
,
broke
loose
a
second
time
,
and
darting
through
a
door
leading
to
the
stone
staircase
in
the
northern
transept
gained
the
ambulatory
,
and
being
closely
followed
,
to
escape
his
pursuers
,
sprang
through
one
of
the
arched
openings
,
and
falling
from
a
height
of
near
sixty
feet
,
was
dashed
in
pieces
on
the
flagged
floor
beneath
.
 
<EOS>
A
walk
through
this
mighty
lazar
-
house
would
have
furnished
a
wholesome
lesson
to
the
most
reckless
observer
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
contain
all
the
sick
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
And
yet
it
was
not
so
.
<EOS>
Hundreds
were
expiring
in
their
own
dwellings
,
and
the
other
pest
-
houses
continued
crowded
as
before
.
<EOS>
Still
,
as
a
far
greater
number
of
the
infected
were
here
congregated
,
and
could
be
seen
at
one
view
,
the
picture
was
incomparably
more
impressive
.
<EOS>
Every
part
of
the
cathedral
was
occupied
.
<EOS>
Those
who
could
not
find
room
inside
it
crouched
beneath
the
columns
of
the
portico
on
rugs
or
blankets
,
and
implored
the
chirurgeons
as
they
passed
to
attend
them
.
<EOS>
Want
of
room
also
drove
others
into
Saint
Faith
's
,
and
here
the
scene
was
,
if
possible
,
more
hideous
.
<EOS>
In
this
dismal
region
it
was
found
impossible
to
obtain
a
free
circulation
of
air
,
and
consequently
the
pestilential
effluvia
,
unable
to
escape
,
acquired
such
malignancy
,
that
it
was
almost
certain
destruction
to
inhale
it
.
<EOS>
After
a
time
,
few
of
the
nurses
and
attendants
would
venture
thither
;
and
to
take
a
patient
to
Saint
Faith
's
was
considered
tantamount
to
consigning
him
to
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
Judith
Malmayns
had
succeeded
or
not
in
curing
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
,
it
is
not
our
present
purpose
to
relate
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
the
cathedral
was
converted
into
a
lazar
-
house
she
returned
thither
,
and
,
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
Doctor
Hodges
,
was
appointed
one
of
the
nurses
.
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
supposed
that
her
appointment
was
the
result
of
any
ill
design
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
attendance
,
that
little
choice
was
left
,
and
the
nurses
being
all
of
questionable
character
<EOS>
,
it
was
supposed
she
was
only
a
shade
worse
than
her
fellows
,
while
she
was
known
to
be
active
and
courageous
.
<EOS>
And
this
was
speedily
proved
;
for
when
Saint
Faith
's
was
deserted
by
the
others
,
she
remained
at
her
post
,
and
quitted
it
neither
night
nor
day
.
<EOS>
A
large
pit
was
digged
in
the
open
space
at
the
north
-
east
corner
of
the
cathedral
,
and
to
this
great
numbers
of
bodies
were
nightly
conveyed
by
Chowles
and
Jonas
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
soon
filled
,
and
they
were
compelled
to
resort
,
as
before
,
to
Finsbury
Fields
,
and
to
another
vast
pit
near
Aldgate
.
<EOS>
When
not
engaged
in
this
revolting
employment
,
Chowles
took
up
his
quarters
in
the
crypt
,
where
,
in
spite
of
his
propinquity
to
the
sick
,
he
indulged
himself
in
his
customary
revelry
.
<EOS>
He
and
Judith
had
amassed
,
in
one
way
or
other
,
a
vast
quantity
of
spoil
,
and
frequently
planned
how
they
would
spend
it
when
the
pestilence
ceased
.
<EOS>
Their
treasure
was
carefully
concealed
in
a
cell
in
one
of
the
secret
passages
with
which
they
were
acquainted
,
leading
from
Saint
Faith
's
to
the
upper
structure
.
 
<EOS>
One
night
,
on
his
return
from
Finsbury
Fields
,
as
Chowles
was
seated
in
the
crypt
,
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
and
a
half
-
finished
flask
of
wine
before
him
,
he
was
startled
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
Judith
,
who
,
rushing
up
to
him
,
seized
him
by
the
throat
,
and
almost
choked
him
before
he
could
extricate
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter?--would
you
strangle
me
,
you
murderous
harridan
?
"
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
that
I
would
,
"
replied
Judith
,
preparing
to
renew
the
attack
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stand
off
!
"
rejoined
Chowles
,
springing
back
,
and
snatching
up
a
spade
,
"
or
I
will
dash
out
your
brains
.
<EOS>
Are
you
mad
?
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
gazing
fearfully
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
angry
enough
to
make
me
so
,
"
she
replied
,
shaking
her
clenched
fists
at
him
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
will
be
revenged
--
revenged
,
I
tell
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Revenged
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Chowles
,
in
astonishment--"for
what
!
<EOS>
What
have
I
done
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
well
to
affect
ignorance
,
"
rejoined
Judith
,
"
but
you
can
not
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
No
one
<EOS>
but
you
can
have
done
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Done
what
!
"
exclaimed
Chowles
,
in
increased
astonishment
.
"
<EOS>
Has
our
hoard
been
discovered
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
and
been
carried
off
--
by
you
--
you
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
Judith
,
with
a
look
worthy
of
a
fury
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
my
soul
,
you
are
wrong
,
"
cried
Chowles
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
touched
it,--never
even
approached
the
hiding
-
place
,
except
in
your
presence
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Liar
!
"
returned
Judith
,
"
the
whole
hoard
is
gone;--the
plunder
I
obtained
in
Newgate,--the
Earl
of
Rochester
's
plate,--all
the
rings
,
trinkets
,
and
rich
apparel
<EOS>
I
have
picked
up
since,--everything
<EOS>
is
gone;--and
who
<EOS>
but
you
can
be
the
robber
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
difficult
to
say
,
"
rejoined
Chowles
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
swear
to
you
,
you
suspect
me
wrongfully
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Restore
it
,
"
replied
Judith
,
"
or
tell
me
where
it
is
hidden
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
I
will
be
the
death
of
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
to
the
hiding
-
place
,
"
replied
Chowles
,
whose
uneasiness
was
not
diminished
by
the
menace
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
mistaken
,
and
I
hope
you
are
.
"
 
<EOS>
Though
he
uttered
the
latter
part
of
his
speech
with
seeming
confidence
,
his
heart
misgave
him
.
<EOS>
To
conceal
his
trepidation
,
he
snatched
up
a
lamp
,
and
passing
through
the
secret
door
,
hurried
along
the
narrow
stone
passage
.
<EOS>
He
was
about
to
open
the
cell
,
when
he
perceived
near
it
the
tall
figure
of
the
enthusiast
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
the
robber
,
"
he
cried
to
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
found
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
Solomon
Eagle
.
<EOS>
Villain
!
<EOS>
you
have
purloined
our
hoard
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
so
,
"
replied
Solomon
Eagle
,
"
and
I
will
carry
off
all
other
spoil
you
may
obtain
.
<EOS>
Think
not
to
hide
it
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
watch
you
when
you
see
me
not
,
and
track
you
when
you
suppose
me
afar
off
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Chowles
,
trembling
.
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
think
he
is
possessed
of
supernatural
power
,
"
he
added
,
in
an
undertone
to
Judith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
"
pursued
Solomon
Eagle
,
"
continue
to
plunder
and
destroy
.
<EOS>
Pursue
your
guilty
career
,
and
see
what
reward
you
will
reap
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Restore
what
you
have
robbed
us
of
,
"
cried
Judith
in
a
menacing
tone
,
"
or
dread
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Woman
,
you
threaten
idly
,
"
returned
Solomon
Eagle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
ill
-
gotten
treasure
is
gone
--
whither
,
you
will
never
know
.
<EOS>
Get
hence
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
in
a
terrible
tone
,
"
or
I
will
rid
the
earth
of
you
both
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
awed
were
they
by
his
voice
and
gestures
,
that
they
slunk
away
with
a
discomfited
air
,
and
returned
to
the
crypt
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
we
are
always
to
be
robbed
in
this
manner
,
"
observed
Chowles
,
"
we
had
better
shift
our
quarters
,
and
practise
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
shall
not
repeat
the
offence
with
impunity
,
"
returned
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
speedily
get
rid
of
him
.
"
 
"
Beware
!
"
cried
a
voice
,
which
they
recognised
as
that
of
Solomon
Eagle
,
though
whence
proceeding
they
could
not
precisely
determine
.
<EOS>
The
pair
looked
at
each
other
uneasily
,
but
neither
spoke
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Leonard
Holt
did
not
omit
to
pay
a
daily
visit
to
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
painful
contemplation
,
and
yet
not
without
deep
interest
,
to
behold
the
constant
succession
of
patients
,
most
of
whom
were
swept
away
by
the
scourge
in
the
course
of
a
couple
of
days
,
or
even
in
a
shorter
period
.
<EOS>
Out
of
every
hundred
persons
attacked
,
five
did
not
recover
;
and
whether
the
virulence
of
the
distemper
increased
,
or
the
summer
heats
rendered
its
victims
more
easily
assailable
,
certain
it
is
they
were
carried
off
far
more
expeditiously
than
before
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
was
unremitting
in
his
attentions
,
but
his
zeal
and
anxiety
availed
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
had
to
contend
with
a
disease
over
which
medicine
exercised
little
control
.
 
<EOS>
One
morning
,
as
he
was
about
to
enter
the
cathedral
,
he
met
Leonard
beneath
the
portico
,
and
as
soon
as
the
latter
caught
sight
of
him
,
he
hurried
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
in
search
of
you
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
was
about
to
proceed
to
your
residence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
wishes
to
see
you
immediately
.
<EOS>
Amabel
is
worse
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
with
you
at
once
,
"
replied
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
And
they
took
the
way
to
Wood
-
street
.
 
<EOS>
"
From
a
few
words
let
<EOS>
fall
by
my
master
,
I
imagine
he
intends
sending
Amabel
into
the
country
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Leonard
,
as
they
proceeded
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
replied
Hodges
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
already
delayed
it
too
long
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
Nizza
Macascree
is
quite
recovered
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
,
or
the
next
day
,
she
will
be
able
to
see
you
with
safety
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
knows
where
I
may
be
to
-
morrow
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wherever
Amabel
goes
,
I
shall
not
be
far
off
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Faithful
to
the
last
!
"
exclaimed
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
shall
not
oppose
you
.
<EOS>
We
must
take
care
the
Earl
of
Rochester
does
not
get
a
hint
of
our
proceeding
.
<EOS>
At
this
time
a
chance
meeting
(
were
it
nothing
more
)
might
prove
fatal
to
the
object
of
our
solicitude
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
said
nothing
,
but
the
colour
fled
his
cheek
,
and
his
lips
slightly
quivered
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
seconds
more
they
reached
the
grocer
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
They
found
him
at
the
window
anxiously
expecting
them
;
and
Doctor
Hodges
,
being
drawn
up
in
the
same
way
as
before
,
was
conducted
to
Amabel
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
She
was
reclining
in
an
easy
-
chair
,
with
the
Bible
on
her
knee
;
and
though
she
was
much
wasted
away
,
she
looked
more
lovely
than
ever
.
<EOS>
A
slight
hectic
flush
increased
the
brilliancy
of
her
eyes
,
which
had
now
acquired
that
ominous
lustre
peculiar
to
persons
in
a
decline
.
<EOS>
There
were
other
distressing
symptoms
in
her
appearance
which
the
skilful
physician
well
knew
how
to
interpret
.
<EOS>
To
an
inexperienced
eye
,
however
,
she
would
have
appeared
charming
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
exceed
the
delicacy
of
her
complexion
,
or
the
lovely
mould
of
her
features
,
which
,
though
they
had
lost
much
of
their
fulness
and
roundness
,
had
gained
in
expression
;
while
the
pencilled
brows
clearly
traced
upon
her
snowy
forehead
,
the
long
dark
eyelashes
shading
her
cheek
,
and
the
rich
satin
tresses
drooping
over
her
shoulders
,
completed
her
attractions
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
stood
by
her
side
,
and
not
far
from
her
sat
little
Christiana
,
amusing
herself
with
some
childish
toy
,
and
ever
and
anon
stealing
an
anxious
glance
at
her
sister
.
<EOS>
Taking
Amabel
's
arm
,
and
sighing
to
himself
to
think
how
thin
it
was
,
the
doctor
placed
his
finger
upon
her
pulse
.
<EOS>
Whatever
might
be
his
secret
opinion
,
he
thought
fit
to
assume
a
hopeful
manner
,
and
looking
smilingly
at
her
,
said
,
"
You
are
better
than
I
expected
,
but
your
departure
to
the
country
must
not
be
deferred
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Since
it
is
my
father
's
wish
that
I
should
do
so
,
"
replied
Amabel
,
gently
,
"
I
am
quite
willing
to
comply
.
<EOS>
But
I
feel
it
will
be
of
no
avail
,
and
I
would
rather
pass
the
rest
of
my
life
here
than
with
strangers
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
happier
than
I
am
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
,
"
replied
Hodges
;
"
but
a
few
weeks
spent
in
some
salubrious
spot
will
remove
all
apprehensions
as
to
your
health
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
your
strength
return
,
and
with
it
the
desire
of
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
life
is
in
the
hands
of
my
Maker
,
"
replied
Amabel
,
"
and
I
am
ready
to
resign
it
whenever
it
shall
be
required
of
me
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
however
anxious
I
may
be
to
quit
a
world
which
appears
a
blank
to
me
,
I
would
make
every
effort
,
for
the
sake
of
those
whose
happiness
is
dearer
to
me
than
my
own
,
to
purchase
a
complete
restoration
to
health
.
<EOS>
If
my
father
desires
me
to
try
a
removal
to
the
country
,
and
you
think
it
will
have
a
beneficial
effect
,
I
am
ready
to
go
.
<EOS>
But
do
not
urge
it
,
unless
you
think
there
is
a
chance
of
my
recovery
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
frankly
,
"
replied
the
doctor
,
"
if
you
remain
here
,
you
have
not
many
weeks
to
live
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
if
I
go
,
will
you
promise
me
health
?
"
rejoined
Amabel
.
"
<EOS>
Do
not
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
Is
there
a
hope
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Unquestionably
,
"
replied
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
Change
of
air
will
work
wonders
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
beseech
you
not
to
hesitate
--
for
my
sake
do
not
,
dearest
daughter
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
with
difficulty
repressing
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
for
mine
,
"
added
her
father
,
more
firmly
,
yet
with
deep
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
expressed
my
readiness
to
accede
to
your
wishes
,
"
replied
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
Whenever
you
have
made
arrangements
for
me
,
I
will
set
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
comes
the
question
--
where
is
she
to
go
?
"
remarked
Hodges
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
sister
,
who
lives
as
housekeeper
at
Lord
Craven
's
seat
,
Ashdown
Park
,
"
replied
Mr.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
She
shall
go
thither
,
and
her
aunt
will
take
every
care
of
her
.
<EOS>
The
mansion
is
situated
amid
the
Berkshire
hills
,
and
the
air
is
the
purest
and
best
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
can
be
better
,
"
replied
Hodges
;
"
but
who
is
to
escort
her
thither
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Leonard
Holt
,
"
replied
Mr.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
gladly
undertake
the
office
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
"
rejoined
Hodges
;
"
but
can
not
you
go
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Impossible
!
"
returned
the
grocer
,
a
shade
passing
over
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Neither
do
I
wish
it
,
"
observed
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
content
to
be
under
the
safeguard
of
Leonard
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Amabel
,
"
said
her
father
,
"
you
know
not
what
I
shall
endure
in
thus
parting
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
would
give
all
I
possess
to
be
able
to
accompany
you
,
but
a
sense
of
duty
restrains
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
taken
the
resolution
to
remain
here
with
my
family
during
the
continuance
of
the
pestilence
,
and
I
must
abide
by
it
.
<EOS>
I
little
thought
how
severely
my
constancy
would
be
tried
.
<EOS>
But
hard
though
it
be
,
I
must
submit
I
shall
commit
you
,
therefore
,
to
the
care
of
an
all
-
merciful
Providence
,
who
will
not
fail
to
watch
over
and
protect
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
no
fear
for
me
,
father
,
"
replied
Amabel
;
"
and
do
not
weep
,
dear
mother
,
"
she
added
to
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
who
,
unable
to
restrain
her
grief
,
was
now
drowned
in
tears
;
"
I
shall
be
well
cared
for
.
<EOS>
If
we
meet
no
more
in
this
world
,
our
reunion
is
certain
in
that
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
have
given
you
much
pain
and
uneasiness
,
but
it
will
be
an
additional
grief
to
me
if
I
think
you
feel
further
anxiety
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
do
not
,
my
dear
child
,
"
replied
Mr.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
well
assured
all
is
for
the
best
,
and
if
it
pleases
Heaven
to
spare
you
,
I
shall
rejoice
beyond
measure
in
your
return
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
I
shall
feel
a
firm
reliance
that
you
will
continue
in
the
same
happy
frame
,
as
at
present
,
to
the
last
,
and
that
we
shall
meet
above
,
where
there
will
be
no
further
separation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
bear
to
part
with
her
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
clasping
her
arms
round
her
daughter--"I
cannot
--
I
can
not
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Restrain
yourself
,
Honora
,
"
said
her
husband
;
"
you
will
do
her
an
injury
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
must
not
be
over
excited
,
"
interposed
Hodges
,
in
a
low
tone
,
and
gently
drawing
the
afflicted
mother
away
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
sooner
,
"
he
added
to
Mr.
Bloundel
,
"
she
now
sets
out
the
better
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
it
,
"
replied
the
grocer
.
<EOS>
"
She
shall
start
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
undertake
to
procure
horses
,
"
replied
Hodges
,
"
and
Leonard
will
be
ready
at
any
moment
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
took
his
leave
,
and
descending
by
the
pulley
,
communicated
to
Leonard
what
had
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
fears
on
her
account
,
the
prospect
of
again
beholding
Amabel
so
transported
the
apprentice
that
he
could
scarcely
attend
to
what
was
said
respecting
her
.
<EOS>
When
he
grew
calmer
,
it
was
arranged
that
all
should
be
in
readiness
at
an
early
hour
on
the
following
morning
;
that
a
couple
of
horses
should
be
provided
;
and
that
Amabel
should
be
let
down
fully
equipped
for
the
journey
.
<EOS>
This
settled
,
Leonard
,
at
the
doctor
's
request
,
accompanied
him
to
his
residence
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
scarcely
out
of
sight
,
when
a
man
,
who
had
been
concealed
behind
the
hutch
,
in
such
a
position
that
not
a
word
that
had
passed
escaped
him
,
issued
from
his
hiding
-
place
,
and
darting
down
the
first
alley
on
the
right
,
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
Whitehall
.
 
<EOS>
Up
to
this
time
,
Doctor
Hodges
had
not
judged
it
prudent
to
allow
a
meeting
between
Leonard
and
Nizza
Macascree
,
but
now
,
from
reasons
of
his
own
,
he
resolved
no
longer
to
delay
it
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
on
reaching
his
dwelling
,
he
took
the
apprentice
to
her
chamber
.
<EOS>
She
was
standing
in
a
pensive
attitude
,
near
a
window
which
looked
towards
the
river
,
and
as
she
turned
on
his
entrance
,
Leonard
perceived
that
her
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
.
<EOS>
Blushing
deeply
,
she
advanced
towards
him
,
and
greeted
him
with
all
the
warmth
of
her
affectionate
nature
.
<EOS>
She
had
quite
recovered
her
good
looks
,
and
Leonard
could
not
but
admit
that
,
had
he
seen
her
before
his
heart
was
plighted
to
another
,
it
must
have
been
given
to
her
.
<EOS>
Comparisons
are
ungracious
,
and
tastes
differ
more
perhaps
as
to
beauty
than
on
any
other
point
;
but
if
Amabel
and
the
piper
's
daughter
had
been
placed
together
,
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
to
determine
to
which
of
the
two
the
palm
of
superior
loveliness
should
be
assigned
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
witchery
in
the
magnificent
black
eyes
of
the
latter
--
in
her
exquisitely
-
formed
mouth
and
pearly
teeth
--
in
her
clear
nut
-
brown
complexion
--
in
her
dusky
and
luxuriant
tresses
,
and
in
her
light
elastic
figure
,
with
which
more
perfect
but
less
piquant
charms
could
not
compete
.
<EOS>
Such
seemed
to
be
the
opinion
of
Doctor
Hodges
,
for
as
he
gazed
at
her
with
unaffected
admiration
<EOS>
,
he
exclaimed
,
as
if
to
himself--
<EOS>
"
I'faith
,
if
I
had
to
choose
between
the
two
,
I
know
which
it
would
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
exclamation
somewhat
disconcerted
the
parties
to
whom
it
referred
,
and
the
doctor
did
not
relieve
their
embarrassment
by
adding
,
"
Well
,
I
perceive
I
am
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
much
to
say
to
each
other
that
can
in
nowise
interest
me
.
<EOS>
Excuse
me
a
moment
,
while
I
see
that
the
horses
are
ordered
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
and
disregarding
Leonard
's
expostulating
looks
,
he
hurried
out
of
the
room
,
and
shut
the
door
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
the
conversation
had
been
unrestrained
and
agreeable
on
both
sides
,
but
now
they
were
left
alone
together
,
neither
appeared
able
to
utter
a
word
.
<EOS>
Nizza
cast
her
eyes
timidly
on
the
ground
,
while
Leonard
caressed
little
Bell
,
who
had
been
vainly
endeavouring
by
her
gamesome
tricks
to
win
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Hodges
spoke
of
ordering
horses
,
"
said
Nizza
,
at
length
breaking
silence
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
on
a
journey
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
about
to
take
Amabel
to
Ashdown
Park
,
in
Berkshire
,
to
-
morrow
morning
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
dangerously
ill
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
the
plague
?
"
asked
Nizza
,
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
a
yet
worse
disorder
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
heaving
a
deep
sigh--"of
a
broken
heart
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
I
pity
her
from
my
soul
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Nizza
,
in
a
tone
of
the
deepest
commiseration
.
<EOS>
"
Does
her
mother
go
with
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
"
I
alone
shall
attend
her
.
<EOS>
She
will
be
placed
under
the
care
of
a
near
female
relative
at
Ashdown
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Would
it
not
be
better,--would
<EOS>
it
not
be
safer
,
if
she
is
in
the
precarious
state
you
describe
,
that
some
one
of
her
own
sex
should
accompany
her
?
"
said
Nizza
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
greatly
prefer
it
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
,
"
and
<EOS>
so
I
am
sure
would
Amabel
.
<EOS>
But
where
is
such
a
person
to
be
found
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
with
you
,
if
you
desire
it
,
"
replied
Nizza
,
"
and
will
watch
over
her
,
and
tend
her
as
a
sister
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
equal
to
the
journey
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Leonard
,
somewhat
doubtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fully
,
"
replied
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
entirely
recovered
,
and
able
to
undergo
far
more
fatigues
than
an
invalid
like
Amabel
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
relieve
me
from
a
world
of
anxiety
if
this
can
be
accomplished
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
consult
Doctor
Hodges
on
the
subject
on
his
return
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
desire
to
consult
me
about
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
physician
,
who
had
entered
the
room
unobserved
at
this
juncture
.
 
<EOS>
The
apprentice
stated
Nizza
's
proposal
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
entirely
approve
of
the
plan
,
"
observed
the
doctor
;
"
it
will
obviate
many
difficulties
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
received
a
message
from
Mr.
Bloundel
,
by
Dallison
,
the
porter
,
to
say
he
intends
sending
Blaize
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
therefore
provide
pillions
for
the
horses
,
so
that
the
whole
party
can
be
accommodated
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
sat
down
and
wrote
out
minute
instructions
for
Amabel
's
treatment
,
and
delivering
the
paper
to
Leonard
,
desired
him
to
give
it
to
the
housekeeper
at
Ashdown
Park
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
only
knows
what
the
result
of
all
this
may
be
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
"
But
nothing
must
be
neglected
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
promised
that
his
advice
should
be
scrupulously
attended
to
;
and
the
discourse
then
turning
to
Nizza
's
father
,
she
expressed
the
utmost
anxiety
to
see
him
before
she
set
out
.
 
<EOS>
Hodges
readily
assented
.
<EOS>
"
Your
father
has
been
discharged
as
cured
from
the
pest
-
house
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
is
lodged
at
a
cottage
,
kept
by
my
old
nurse
,
Dame
Lucas
,
just
without
the
walls
,
near
Moorgate
.
<EOS>
I
will
send
for
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
no
account
,
"
replied
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
him
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
you
please
,
"
returned
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
Leonard
shall
accompany
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
easily
find
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
It
is
about
two
hundred
yards
beyond
the
gate
,
on
the
right
,
near
the
old
doghouses
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
spot
perfectly
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
recommend
you
to
put
on
a
mask
,
"
observed
the
doctor
to
Nizza
;
"
it
may
protect
you
from
molestation
.
<EOS>
I
will
find
you
one
below
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leading
the
way
to
a
lower
room
,
he
opened
a
drawer
,
and
,
producing
a
small
loo
mask
,
gave
it
her
.
<EOS>
The
youthful
pair
then
quitted
the
house
,
Nizza
taking
Bell
under
her
arm
,
as
she
intended
leaving
her
with
her
father
.
<EOS>
The
necessity
of
the
doctor
's
caution
was
speedily
manifested
,
for
as
they
crossed
Saint
Paul
's
churchyard
they
encountered
Pillichody
,
who
,
glancing
inquisitively
at
Nizza
,
seemed
disposed
to
push
his
inquiries
further
by
attempting
to
take
off
her
mask
;
but
the
fierce
look
of
the
apprentice
,
who
grasped
his
staff
in
a
menacing
manner
,
induced
him
to
abandon
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
followed
them
along
Cheapside
,
and
would
have
continued
the
pursuit
along
the
Old
Jewry
,
if
Leonard
had
not
come
to
a
halt
,
and
awaited
his
approach
.
<EOS>
He
then
took
to
his
heels
,
and
did
not
again
make
his
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
reached
the
open
fields
and
slackened
their
pace
,
Leonard
deemed
it
prudent
to
prepare
his
companion
for
her
interview
with
her
father
by
mentioning
the
circumstance
of
the
packet
,
and
the
important
secret
which
he
had
stated
he
had
to
disclose
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
what
the
secret
can
relate
to
,
unless
it
is
to
my
mother
,
"
rejoined
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
died
,
I
believe
,
when
I
was
an
infant
.
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
I
never
remember
seeing
her
,
and
I
have
remarked
that
my
father
is
averse
to
talking
about
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
now
question
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
think
this
piece
of
gold
,
"
and
she
produced
the
amulet
,
"
is
in
some
way
or
other
connected
with
the
mystery
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
then
explained
to
Leonard
all
that
had
occurred
in
the
vault
when
the
coin
had
been
shown
to
Judith
Malmayns
,
describing
the
nurse
's
singular
look
and
her
father
's
subsequent
anger
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
they
had
entered
a
narrow
footpath
leading
across
the
fields
in
the
direction
of
a
little
nest
of
cottages
,
and
pursuing
it
,
they
came
to
a
garden
-
gate
.
<EOS>
Opening
it
,
they
beheld
the
piper
seated
beneath
a
little
porch
covered
with
eglantine
and
roses
.
<EOS>
He
was
playing
a
few
notes
on
his
pipe
,
but
stopped
on
hearing
their
approach
.
<EOS>
Bell
,
who
had
been
put
to
the
ground
by
Nizza
,
ran
barking
gleefully
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Uttering
a
joyful
exclamation
,
the
piper
stretched
out
his
arms
,
and
the
next
moment
enfolded
his
daughter
in
a
strict
embrace
.
<EOS>
Leonard
remained
at
the
gate
till
the
first
transports
of
their
meeting
were
over
,
and
then
advanced
slowly
towards
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whose
footsteps
are
those
?
"
inquired
the
piper
.
 
<EOS>
Nizza
explained
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
is
it
Leonard
Holt
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
piper
,
extending
his
hand
to
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
heartily
welcome
,
"
he
added
;
"
and
I
am
glad
to
find
you
with
Nizza
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
secret
to
me
that
she
likes
you
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
an
excellent
daughter
,
and
will
make
an
excellent
wife
.
<EOS>
He
who
weds
her
will
obtain
a
greater
treasure
than
he
expects
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Not
than
he
expects
,
"
said
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
than
he
expects
,
"
reiterated
the
piper
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
one
day
find
out
that
I
speak
the
truth
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
looked
at
Nizza
,
who
was
blushing
deeply
at
her
father
's
remark
.
<EOS>
She
understood
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
understand
you
have
a
secret
of
importance
to
disclose
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
about
to
make
a
long
journey
to
-
morrow
,
and
may
not
return
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
At
this
uncertain
season
,
when
those
who
part
know
not
that
they
shall
meet
again
,
nothing
of
this
sort
ought
to
be
withheld
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
know
it
while
I
live
,
"
replied
the
piper
,
"
but
I
will
take
such
precautions
that
,
if
anything
happens
to
me
,
it
shall
be
certainly
revealed
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
satisfied
,
"
she
rejoined
,
"
and
will
only
ask
you
one
farther
question
,
and
I
beseech
you
to
answer
it
.
<EOS>
Does
this
amulet
refer
to
the
secret
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
does
,
"
replied
her
father
,
sullenly
;
"
and
now
let
the
subject
be
dropped
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
led
the
way
into
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
The
good
old
dame
who
kept
it
,
on
learning
who
they
were
,
and
that
they
were
sent
by
Doctor
Hodges
,
gave
them
a
hearty
welcome
,
and
placed
refreshments
before
them
.
<EOS>
Leonard
commented
upon
the
extreme
neatness
of
the
abode
and
its
healthful
situation
,
and
expressed
a
hope
that
it
might
not
be
visited
by
the
plague
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
it
will
not
,
"
rejoined
the
old
woman
,
shaking
her
head
;
"
but
when
I
hear
the
doleful
bell
at
night
--
when
I
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
fatal
cart
--
or
look
towards
yon
dreadful
place
,
"
and
she
pointed
in
the
direction
of
the
plague
-
pit
,
which
lay
only
a
few
hundred
yards
to
the
west
of
her
habitation--"I
<EOS>
am
reminded
that
the
scourge
is
not
far
off
,
and
that
it
must
needs
reach
me
ere
long
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
no
fear
,
Dame
Lucas
,
"
said
the
piper
;

"
you
see
it
has
pleased
a
merciful
Providence
to
spare
the

of
myself

my

and

The

<EOS>
rejoined
Dame
Lucas
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
shall
be
well
attended
to
by
Doctor
Hodges
.
<EOS>
I
nursed
him
when
he
was
an
infant
,
and
he
has
been
like
a
son
to
me
.
<EOS>
Bless
his
kind
heart
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
of
gratitude
,
"
there
is
not
his
like
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Always
excepting
my
master
,
"
observed
Leonard
,
with
a
smile
at
her
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
except
no
one
,
"
rejoined
Dame
Lucas
.
<EOS>
"
A
worthier
man
never
lived
,
than
Doctor
Hodges
.
<EOS>
If
I
die
of
the
plague
,
"
she
continued
,
"
he
has
promised
not
to
let
me
be
thrown
into
that
horrible
pit
--
ough!--but
to
bury
me
in
my
garden
,
beneath
the
old
apple
-
tree
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
he
will
keep
his
word
,
dame
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
recommend
you
,
however
,
as
the
best
antidote
against
the
plague
,
to
keep
yourself
constantly
employed
,
and
to
indulge
as
few
gloomy
notions
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
seldom
melancholy
,
and
still
more
seldom
idle
,
"
replied
the
good
dame
.
"
<EOS>
But
despondency
will
steal
on
me
sometimes
,
especially
when
the
dead
-
cart
passes
and
I
think
what
it
contains
.
<EOS>
"
 
While
the
conversation
was
going
forward
,
Nizza
and
the
piper
withdrew
into
an
inner
room
,
where
they
remained
closeted
together
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
On
their
re
-
appearance
,
Nizza
said
she
was
ready
to
depart
,
and
taking
an
affectionate
farewell
of
her
father
,
and
committing
Bell
to
his
charge
,
she
quitted
the
cottage
with
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
Evening
was
now
advancing
,
and
the
sun
was
setting
with
the
gorgeousness
already
described
as
peculiar
to
this
fatal
period
.
<EOS>
Filled
with
the
pleasing
melancholy
inspired
by
the
hour
,
they
walked
on
in
silence
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
proceeded
far
,
when
they
observed
a
man
crossing
the
field
with
a
bundle
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
he
staggered
and
fell
.
<EOS>
Seeing
he
did
not
stir
,
and
guessing
what
was
the
matter
,
Leonard
ran
towards
him
to
offer
him
assistance
.
<EOS>
He
found
him
lying
in
the
grass
with
his
left
hand
fixed
against
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
groaned
heavily
,
and
his
features
were
convulsed
with
pain
.
<EOS>
Near
him
lay
the
body
of
a
beautiful
little
girl
,
with
long
fair
hair
,
and
finely
-
formed
features
,
though
now
disfigured
by
purple
blotches
,
proclaiming
the
disorder
of
which
she
had
perished
.
<EOS>
She
was
apparently
about
ten
years
old
,
and
was
partially
covered
by
a
linen
cloth
.
<EOS>
The
man
,
whose
features
bore
a
marked
resemblance
to
those
of
the
child
,
was
evidently
from
his
attire
above
the
middle
rank
.
<EOS>
His
frame
was
athletic
,
and
as
he
was
scarcely
past
the
prime
of
life
,
the
irresistible
power
of
the
disease
,
which
could
in
one
instant
prostrate
strength
like
his
,
was
terribly
attested
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
"
he
cried
,
addressing
the
apprentice
,
"
I
was
about
to
convey
the
remains
of
my
poor
child
to
the
plague
-
pit
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
been
unable
to
accomplish
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
hoped
she
would
have
escaped
the
polluting
touch
of
those
loathly
attendants
on
the
dead
-
cart
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
_
shall
_
escape
it
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
"
if
you
wish
it
,
I
will
carry
her
to
the
pit
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
blessing
of
a
dying
man
rest
on
your
head
,
"
cried
the
sufferer
;
"
your
charitable
action
will
not
pass
unrequited
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
despite
the
agony
he
endured
,
he
dragged
himself
to
his
child
,
kissed
her
cold
lips
,
smoothed
her
fair
tresses
,
and
covered
the
body
carefully
with
the
cloth
.
<EOS>
He
then
delivered
it
to
Leonard
,
who
received
it
tenderly
,
and
calling
to
Nizza
Macascree
,
who
had
witnessed
the
scene
at
a
little
distance
,
and
was
deeply
affected
by
it
,
to
await
his
return
,
ran
towards
the
plague
-
pit
.
<EOS>
Arrived
there
,
he
placed
his
little
burden
at
the
brink
of
the
excavation
,
and
,
kneeling
beside
it
,
uttered
a
short
prayer
inspired
by
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
then
tore
his
handkerchief
into
strips
,
and
tying
them
together
,
lowered
the
body
gently
down
.
<EOS>
Throwing
a
little
earth
over
it
,
he
hastened
to
the
sick
man
,
and
told
him
what
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
A
smile
of
satisfaction
illumined
the
sufferer
's
countenance
,
and
holding
out
his
hand
,
on
which
a
valuable
ring
glistened
,
he
said
,
"
Take
it
--
it
is
but
a
poor
reward
for
the
service
you
have
rendered
me;--nay
,
take
it
,
"
he
added
,
seeing
that
the
apprentice
hesitated
;
"
others
will
not
be
so
scrupulous
.
"
 
<EOS>
Unable
to
gainsay
the
remark
,
Leonard
took
the
ring
from
his
finger
and
placed
it
on
his
own
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
the
sick
man
's
gaze
fell
upon
Nizza
,
who
stood
at
a
little
distance
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
started
,
and
made
an
effort
to
clear
his
vision
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
my
eyes
deceive
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
"
or
is
a
female
standing
there
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
deceived
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
her
come
near
me
,
in
Heaven
's
name
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
sick
man
,
staring
at
her
as
if
his
eyes
would
start
from
their
sockets
.
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
as
Nizza
approached
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
called
Nizza
Macascree
,
and
am
the
daughter
of
a
poor
piper
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
sick
man
,
with
a
look
of
deep
disappointment
.
<EOS>
"
The
resemblance
is
wonderful
!
<EOS>
And
yet
it
can
not
be
.
<EOS>
My
brain
is
bewildered
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Whom
does
she
resemble
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Leonard
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
very
dear
to
me
,
"
replied
the
sick
man
,
with
an
expression
of
remorse
and
anguish
,
"
one
I
would
not
think
of
now
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
buried
his
face
in
the
grass
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
there
aught
more
I
can
do
for
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Leonard
,
after
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
the
sick
man
;
"
I
have
done
with
the
world
.
<EOS>
With
that
child
,
the
last
tie
that
bound
me
to
it
was
snapped
.
<EOS>
I
now
only
wish
to
die
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
give
way
thus
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
"
a
short
time
ago
my
condition
was
as
apparently
hopeless
as
your
own
,
and
you
see
I
am
now
perfectly
recovered
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
something
to
live
for
--
something
to
love
,
"
groaned
the
sick
man
.
<EOS>
"
All
I
lived
for
,
all
I
loved
,
are
gone
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Be
comforted
,
sir
,
"
said
Nizza
,
in
a
commiserating
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Much
happiness
may
yet
be
in
store
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
voice
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
sick
man
,
with
a
look
denoting
the
approach
of
delirium
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
my
Isabella
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
forgive
me
!
<EOS>
sweet
injured
saint
;
forgive
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
presence
evidently
distresses
him
,
"
said
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
hasten
for
assistance
.
<EOS>
Your
name
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
to
the
sick
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
seek
to
know
it
?
<EOS>
"
replied
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
No
tombstone
will
be
placed
over
the
plague
-
pit
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
moment
must
be
lost
if
you
would
save
him
,
"
cried
Nizza
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
fly
to
the
nearest
apothecary
's
.
"
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
they
set
off
at
a
quick
pace
towards
Moorgate
.
<EOS>
Just
as
they
reached
it
,
they
heard
the
bell
ring
,
and
saw
the
dead
-
cart
approaching
.
<EOS>
Shrinking
back
while
it
passed
,
they
ran
on
till
they
came
to
an
apothecary
's
shop
,
where
Leonard
,
describing
the
state
of
the
sick
man
,
by
his
entreaties
induced
the
master
of
the
establishment
and
one
of
his
assistants
to
accompany
him
.
<EOS>
Leaving
Nizza
in
the
shop
,
he
then
retraced
his
steps
with
his
companions
.
<EOS>
The
sick
man
was
lying
where
he
had
left
him
,
but
perfectly
insensible
.
<EOS>
On
searching
his
pockets
,
a
purse
of
money
was
found
,
but
neither
letter
nor
tablet
to
tell
who
he
was
.
<EOS>
Leonard
offered
the
purse
to
the
apothecary
,
but
the
latter
declined
it
,
and
desired
his
assistant
,
who
had
brought
a
barrow
with
him
,
to
place
the
sick
man
within
it
,
and
convey
him
to
the
pest
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
better
cared
for
there
than
if
I
were
to
take
charge
of
him
,
"
he
observed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
the
money
,
you
can
return
it
if
he
recovers
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
it
of
right
belongs
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Seeing
that
remonstrance
would
be
useless
,
Leonard
did
not
attempt
it
,
and
while
the
assistant
wheeled
away
the
sick
man
,
he
returned
with
the
apothecary
to
his
dwelling
.
<EOS>
Thanking
him
for
his
kindness
,
he
then
hastened
with
Nizza
Macascree
to
Great
Knightrider
-
street
.
<EOS>
He
related
to
the
doctor
all
that
had
occurred
,
and
showed
him
the
ring
.
<EOS>
Hodges
listened
to
the
recital
with
great
attention
,
and
at
its
close
said
,
"
This
is
a
very
singular
affair
,
and
excites
my
curiosity
greatly
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
to
the
pest
-
house
and
see
the
sick
man
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
And
now
we
will
proceed
to
supper
;
and
then
you
had
better
retire
to
rest
,
for
you
will
have
to
be
astir
before
daybreak
.
<EOS>
All
is
in
readiness
for
the
journey
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
last
night
(
for
such
she
considered
it
)
spent
by
Amabel
in
her
father
's
dwelling
,
was
passed
in
the
kindliest
interchanges
of
affection
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
had
much
ado
to
maintain
his
firmness
,
and
ever
and
anon
,
in
spite
of
his
efforts
,
his
labouring
bosom
and
faltering
tones
proclaimed
the
struggle
within
.
<EOS>
He
sat
beside
his
daughter
,
with
her
thin
fingers
clasped
in
his
,
and
spoke
to
her
on
every
consolatory
topic
that
suggested
itself
.
<EOS>
This
discourse
,
however
,
insensibly
took
a
serious
turn
,
and
the
grocer
became
fully
convinced
that
his
daughter
was
not
merely
reconciled
to
the
early
death
that
to
all
appearance
awaited
her
,
but
wishful
for
it
.
<EOS>
He
found
,
too
,
to
his
inexpressible
grief
,
that
the
sense
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
's
treachery
,
combined
with
her
own
indiscretion
,
and
the
consequences
that
might
have
attended
it
,
had
sunk
deep
in
her
heart
,
and
produced
the
present
sad
result
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
it
will
scarcely
be
supposed
,
could
support
herself
so
well
as
her
husband
,
but
when
any
paroxysm
of
grief
approached
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
,
and
gave
vent
to
her
affliction
alone
.
<EOS>
All
the
rest
of
the
family
were
present
,
and
were
equally
distressed
.
<EOS>
But
what
most
strongly
affected
Amabel
was
a
simple
,
natural
remark
of
little
Christiana
,
who
,
fixing
her
tearful
gaze
on
her
,
entreated
her
"
to
come
back
soon
.
"
 
<EOS>
Weak
as
she
was
,
Amabel
took
the
child
upon
her
knee
,
and
said
to
her
,
"
I
am
going
a
long
journey
,
Christiana
,
and
,
perhaps
may
never
come
back
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
attend
to
what
your
father
says
to
you
,
if
you
never
omit
,
morning
and
evening
,
to
implore
the
blessing
of
Heaven
,
we
shall
meet
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
what
you
mean
,
sister
,
"
said
Christiana
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
place
you
are
going
to
is
the
grave
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
guessed
rightly
,
Christiana
,
"
rejoined
Amabel
,
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
forget
my
last
words
to
you
,
and
when
you
are
grown
into
a
woman
,
think
upon
the
poor
sister
who
loved
you
tenderly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
always
think
of
you
,
"
said
Christiana
,
clasping
her
arms
round
her
sister
's
neck
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
go
to
the
grave
instead
of
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
Amabel
pressed
her
to
her
bosom
,
and
in
a
broken
voice
murmured
a
blessing
over
her
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
here
thought
it
necessary
to
interfere
,
and
,
taking
the
weeping
child
in
his
arms
,
carried
her
into
the
adjoining
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
the
household
were
summoned
to
prayers
,
and
as
the
grocer
poured
forth
an
address
to
Heaven
for
the
preservation
of
his
daughter
,
all
earnestly
joined
in
the
supplication
.
<EOS>
Their
devotions
ended
,
Amabel
took
leave
of
her
brothers
,
and
the
parting
might
have
been
painfully
prolonged
but
for
the
interposition
of
her
father
.
<EOS>
The
last
and
severest
trial
was
at
hand
.
<EOS>
She
had
now
to
part
from
her
mother
,
from
whom
,
except
on
the
occasion
of
her
flight
with
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
she
had
never
yet
been
separated
.
<EOS>
She
had
now
to
part
with
her
,
in
all
probability
,
for
ever
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
heart
-
breaking
reflection
to
both
.
<EOS>
Knowing
it
would
only
renew
their
affliction
,
and
perhaps
unfit
Amabel
for
the
journey
,
Mr.
Bloundel
had
prevailed
upon
his
wife
not
to
see
her
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
The
moment
had
,
therefore
,
arrived
when
they
were
to
bid
each
other
farewell
.
<EOS>
The
anguish
displayed
in
his
wife
's
countenance
was
too
much
for
the
grocer
,
and
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
.
<EOS>
He
heard
her
approach
Amabel
--
he
listened
to
their
mutual
sobs
--
to
their
last
embrace
.
<EOS>
It
was
succeeded
by
a
stifled
cry
,
and
uncovering
his
face
at
the
sound
,
he
sprang
to
his
feet
just
in
time
to
receive
his
swooning
wife
in
his
arms
.

<EOS>
THE
DEPARTURE
.
 
<EOS>
It
struck
four
by
Saint
Paul
's
as
Doctor
Hodges
,
accompanied
by
Leonard
and
Nizza
Macascree
,
issued
from
his
dwelling
,
and
proceeded
towards
Wood
-
street
.
<EOS>
The
party
was
followed
by
a
man
leading
a
couple
of
horses
,
equipped
with
pillions
,
and
furnished
with
saddle
-
bags
,
partly
filled
with
the
scanty
luggage
which
the
apprentice
and
the
piper
's
daughter
took
with
them
.
<EOS>
A
slight
haze
,
indicative
of
the
intense
heat
about
to
follow
,
hung
round
the
lower
part
of
the
cathedral
,
but
its
topmost
pinnacles
glittered
in
the
beams
of
the
newly
-
risen
sun
.
<EOS>
As
Leonard
gazed
at
the
central
tower
,
he
descried
Solomon
Eagle
on
its
summit
,
and
pointed
him
out
to
Hodges
.
<EOS>
Motioning
the
apprentice
,
in
a
manner
that
could
not
be
misunderstood
,
to
halt
,
the
enthusiast
vanished
,
and
in
another
moment
appeared
upon
the
roof
,
and
descended
to
the
battlements
,
overlooking
the
spot
where
the
little
party
stood
.
<EOS>
This
was
at
the
northwest
corner
of
the
cathedral
,
at
a
short
distance
from
the
portico
.
<EOS>
The
enthusiast
had
a
small
sack
in
his
hand
,
and
calling
to
Nizza
Macascree
to
take
it
,
flung
it
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
ringing
sound
which
it
made
on
its
fall
proved
that
it
contained
gold
or
silver
,
while
its
size
showed
that
the
amount
must
be
considerable
.
<EOS>
Nizza
looked
at
it
in
astonishment
,
but
did
not
offer
to
touch
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
it
!
<EOS>
"
thundered
Solomon
Eagle
;
"
it
is
your
dowry
.
"
<EOS>
And
perceiving
she
hesitated
to
comply
with
the
injunction
,
he
shouted
to
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
Give
it
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
use
for
gold
.
<EOS>
May
it
make
you
and
her
happy
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
where
he
can
have
obtained
this
money
,
"
observed
Hodges
;
"
but
I
am
sure
in
no
unlawful
manner
,
and
I
therefore
counsel
Nizza
to
accept
the
boon
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
of
the
greatest
use
to
her
at
some
future
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
scruples
being
thus
overcome
,
Leonard
took
the
sack
,
and
placed
it
in
one
of
the
saddle
-
bags
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
examine
it
at
your
leisure
,
"
remarked
Hodges
to
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
no
more
time
to
lose
.
"
 
<EOS>
Solomon
Eagle
,
meanwhile
,
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
the
apprentice
's
compliance
by
his
gestures
,
and
,
waving
his
staff
round
his
head
,
pointed
towards
the
west
of
the
city
,
as
if
inquiring
whether
that
was
the
route
they
meant
to
take
.
<EOS>
Leonard
nodded
an
affirmative
;
and
,
the
enthusiast
spreading
out
his
arms
and
pronouncing
an
audible
benediction
over
them
,
they
resumed
their
course
.
<EOS>
The
streets
were
silent
and
deserted
,
except
by
the
watchmen
stationed
at
the
infected
dwellings
,
and
a
few
sick
persons
stretched
on
the
steps
of
some
of
the
better
habitations
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
avoid
coming
in
contact
with
these
miserable
creatures
,
the
party
,
with
the
exception
of
Doctor
Hodges
,
kept
in
the
middle
of
the
road
.
<EOS>
Attracted
by
the
piteous
exclamations
of
the
sufferers
,
Doctor
Hodges
,
ever
and
anon
,
humanely
paused
to
speak
to
them
;
and
he
promised
one
poor
woman
,
who
was
suckling
an
infant
,
to
visit
her
on
his
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
hopes
of
saving
her
,
"
he
observed
to
Leonard
,
"
but
I
may
preserve
her
child
.
<EOS>
There
is
an
establishment
in
Aldgate
for
infants
whose
mothers
have
died
of
the
plague
,
where
more
than
a
hundred
little
creatures
are
suckled
by
she
-
goats
,
and
it
is
wonderful
how
well
they
thrive
under
their
nurses
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
induce
this
poor
woman
to
part
with
her
child
,
I
will
send
it
thither
.
"
 
<EOS>
Just
then
,
their
attention
was
arrested
by
the
sudden
opening
of
a
casement
,
and
a
middle
-
aged
woman
,
wringing
her
hands
,
cried
,
with
a
look
of
unutterable
anguish
and
despair--"Pray
<EOS>
for
us
,
good
people
!
<EOS>
pray
for
us
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
_
do
_
pray
for
you
,
my
poor
soul
!
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Hodges
,
"
as
well
as
for
all
who
are
similarly
afflicted
.
<EOS>
What
sick
have
you
within
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
were
ten
yesterday
,
"
replied
the
woman
.
<EOS>
"
Two
have
died
in
the
night
--
my
husband
and
my
eldest
son
--
and
there
are
eight
others
whose
recovery
is
hopeless
.
<EOS>
Pray
for
us
!
<EOS>
As
you
hope
to
be
spared
yourselves
,
pray
for
us
!
"
<EOS>
And
,
with
a
lamentable
cry
,
she
closed
the
casement
.
 
<EOS>
Familiarized
as
all
who
heard
her
were
with
spectacles
of
horror
and
tales
of
woe
,
they
could
not
listen
to
this
sad
recital
,
nor
look
upon
her
distracted
countenance
,
without
the
deepest
commiseration
.
<EOS>
Other
sights
had
previously
affected
them
,
but
not
in
the
same
degree
.
<EOS>
Around
the
little
conduit
standing
in
front
of
the
Old
Change
,
at
the
western
extremity
of
Cheapside
,
were
three
lazars
laving
their
sores
in
the
water
;
while
,
in
the
short
space
between
this
spot
and
Wood
-
street
,
Leonard
counted
upwards
of
twenty
doors
marked
with
the
fatal
red
cross
,
and
bearing
upon
them
the
sad
inscription
,
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
!
"
 
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
'
walking
brought
them
to
the
grocer
's
habitation
,
and
on
reaching
it
,
they
found
that
Blaize
had
already
descended
.
<EOS>
He
was
capering
about
the
street
with
joy
at
his
restoration
to
freedom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mistress
Amabel
will
make
her
appearance
in
a
few
minutes
,
"
he
said
to
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
Our
master
is
with
her
,
and
is
getting
all
ready
for
her
departure
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
come
unprovided
with
medicine
,
"
he
added
to
Doctor
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
got
a
bottle
of
plague
-
water
in
one
pocket
,
and
a
phial
of
vinegar
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
I
have
a
small
pot
of
Mayerne
's
electuary
in
my
bag
,
another
of
the
grand
antipestilential
confection
,
and
a
fourth
of
the
infallible
antidote
which
I
bought
of
the
celebrated
Greek
physician
,
Doctor
Constantine
Rhodocanaceis
,
at
his
shop
near
the
Three
-
Kings
Inn
,
in
Southampton
-
buildings
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
have
heard
of
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
have
_
heard
of
the
quack
,
"
replied
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
end
was
a
just
retribution
for
the
tricks
he
practised
on
his
dupes
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
infallible
antidote
,
he
was
carried
off
by
the
scourge
.
<EOS>
But
what
else
have
you
got
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Only
a
few
trifles
,
"
replied
Blaize
,
with
a
chap
-
fallen
look
.
<EOS>
"
Patience
has
made
me
a
pomander
-
ball
composed
of
angelica
,
rue
,
zedoary
,
camphor
,
wax
,
and
laudanum
,
which
I
have
hung
round
my
neck
with
a
string
.
<EOS>
Then
I
have
got
a
good
-
sized
box
of
rufuses
,
and
have
swallowed
three
of
them
preparatory
to
the
journey
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
proper
precaution
,
"
observed
Hodges
,
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
all
,
"
replied
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
my
mother
's
advice
,
I
have
eaten
twenty
leaves
of
rue
,
two
roasted
figs
,
and
two
pickled
walnuts
for
breakfast
,
washing
them
down
with
an
ale
posset
,
with
pimpernel
seethed
in
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
in
a
pretty
condition
for
a
journey
.
<EOS>
But
how
could
you
bear
to
part
with
your
mother
and
Patience
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
parting
from
Patience
<EOS>
_
was
_
heart
-
breaking
,
"
replied
Blaize
,
taking
out
his
handkerchief
,
and
applying
it
to
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
We
sat
up
half
the
night
together
,
and
I
felt
so
much
overcome
that
I
began
to
waver
in
my
resolution
of
departing
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
I
did
not
give
way
now
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
more
sprightly
tone
.
"
<EOS>
Fresh
air
and
bright
sunshine
are
very
different
things
from
the
close
rooms
in
that
dark
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
forget
that
you
were
there
free
from
the
contagion
,
"
rejoined
Hodges
;
"
while
you
are
here
exposed
to
its
assaults
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
replied
Blaize
;
"
that
makes
a
vast
difference
.
<EOS>
I
almost
wish
I
was
back
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
late
to
think
of
returning
,
"
said
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mount
your
horse
,
and
I
will
assist
Nizza
into
the
pillion
.
"
 
<EOS>
By
the
time
that
Blaize
,
who
was
but
an
indifferent
horseman
,
had
got
into
the
saddle
,
and
Nizza
had
taken
her
place
behind
him
,
the
window
opened
,
and
Mr.
Bloundel
appeared
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
Amabel
had
only
retired
to
rest
for
a
few
hours
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
When
left
to
herself
in
her
chamber
,
she
continued
to
pray
till
exhaustion
compelled
her
to
seek
some
repose
.
<EOS>
Arising
about
two
o'clock
,
she
employed
herself
for
more
than
an
hour
in
further
devotion
,
and
then
took
a
last
survey
of
every
object
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
had
occupied
it
from
her
childhood
;
and
as
she
opened
drawer
after
drawer
,
and
cupboard
after
cupboard
,
and
examined
their
contents
,
each
article
recalled
some
circumstance
connected
with
the
past
,
and
brought
back
a
train
of
long
-
forgotten
emotions
.
<EOS>
While
she
was
thus
engaged
,
Patience
tapped
at
the
door
,
and
was
instantly
admitted
.
<EOS>
The
tenderhearted
kitchenmaid
assisted
her
to
dress
,
and
to
put
together
some
few
articles
omitted
to
be
packed
by
her
mother
.
<EOS>
During
this
employment
she
shed
abundance
of
tears
,
and
Amabel
's
efforts
to
console
her
only
made
matters
worse
.
<EOS>
Poor
Patience
was
forced
at
last
to
sit
down
,
and
indulge
a
hearty
fit
of
crying
,
after
which
she
felt
considerably
relieved
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
be
able
to
speak
,
she
observed
to
Amabel
,
"
Pardon
what
I
am
about
to
say
to
you
,
my
dear
young
mistress
,
but
I
can
not
help
thinking
that
the
real
seat
of
your
disease
is
in
the
heart
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
A
slight
blush
overspread
Amabel
's
pale
features
,
but
she
made
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
I
am
right
,
"
continued
Patience
,
"
and
<EOS>
indeed
I
have
long
suspected
it
.
<EOS>
Let
me
entreat
you
,
therefore
,
dear
young
lady
,
not
to
sacrifice
yourself
.
<EOS>
Only
say
the
word
,
and
I
will
find
means
of
making
your
retreat
known
to
the
Earl
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
Blaize
is
devoted
to
you
,
and
will
do
anything
you
bid
him
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
wonder
you
fret
after
so
handsome
,
so
captivating
a
man
as
the
earl
,
especially
when
you
are
worried
to
death
to
marry
a
common
apprentice
like
Leonard
Holt
,
who
is
not
fit
to
hold
a
candle
to
your
noble
admirer
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
we
women
can
never
blind
ourselves
to
the
advantages
of
rank
and
appearance
.
<EOS>
We
are
too
good
judges
for
that
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
soon
be
restored
to
your
lover
,
and
that
the
happiness
you
will
enjoy
will
make
amends
for
all
the
misery
you
have
endured
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Patience
,
"
said
Amabel
,
whose
cheek
,
as
the
other
spoke
,
had
returned
to
its
original
paleness--"Patience
,
"
she
said
,
gravely
,
but
kindly
,
"
I
have
suffered
you
to
proceed
too
far
without
interruption
,
and
must
correct
the
very
serious
error
into
which
you
have
fallen
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
far
from
pining
for
an
interview
with
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
that
nothing
in
the
world
should
induce
me
to
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
I
have
loved
him
deeply
,
"
she
continued
in
a
tremulous
tone
;
"
nay
,
I
will
not
attempt
to
disguise
that
I
feel
strongly
towards
him
still
,
while
I
will
also
freely
confess
that
his
conduct
towards
me
has
so
preyed
upon
my
spirits
,
that
it
has
impaired
,
perhaps
destroyed
,
my
health
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
this
,
I
can
not
sufficiently
rejoice
that
I
have
escaped
the
earl
's
snares
--
I
can
not
be
sufficiently
thankful
to
the
merciful
Being
who
,
while
he
has
thought
fit
to
chastise
me
,
has
preserved
me
from
utter
ruin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Since
you
are
of
this
mind
,
"
returned
Patience
,
in
a
tone
of
incredulity
,
"
you
are
more
to
be
rejoiced
with
than
pitied
.
<EOS>
But
we
are
not
overheard
,
"
she
added
,
almost
in
a
whisper
,
and
glancing
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
entirely
confide
in
me
.
<EOS>
The
time
is
arrived
when
you
can
escape
to
your
lover
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
more
of
this
,
"
rejoined
Amabel
,
severely
,
"
or
<EOS>
I
shall
command
you
to
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
nothing
more
than
pique
,
"
thought
Patience
.
<EOS>
"
We
women
are
all
hypocrites
,
even
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
I
will
serve
her
whether
she
will
or
not
.
<EOS>
She
_
shall
_
see
the
earl
.
<EOS>
I
hope
there
is
no
harm
in
wishing
you
may
be
happy
with
Leonard
Holt
,
"
she
added
aloud
.
"
<EOS>
_
He
_
will
make
you
a
capital
husband
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
subject
is
equally
disagreeable
--
equally
painful
to
me
,
"
said
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
had
better
hold
my
tongue
altogether
,
"
rejoined
Patience
,
somewhat
pertly
.
<EOS>
"
Whatever
I
say
seems
to
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
prevent
me
from
doing
as
I
would
be
done
by
,
"
she
added
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Amabel
's
preparations
finished
,
she
dismissed
Patience
,
to
whom
she
gave
some
few
slight
remembrances
,
and
was
soon
afterwards
joined
by
her
father
.
<EOS>
They
passed
half
an
hour
together
,
as
on
the
former
night
,
in
serious
and
devout
conversation
,
after
which
Mr.
Bloundel
left
her
for
a
few
minutes
to
let
down
Blaize
.
<EOS>
On
his
return
he
tenderly
embraced
her
,
and
led
her
into
the
passage
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
advanced
many
steps
when
Mrs.
Bloundel
rushed
forth
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
her
night
-
dress
,
and
seemed
overwhelmed
with
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
is
this
,
Honora
?
<EOS>
"
cried
her
husband
,
in
a
severe
tone
.
<EOS>
"
You
promised
me
you
would
see
Amabel
no
more
.
<EOS>
You
will
only
distress
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
let
her
go
thus
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
listening
at
my
chamber
door
to
hear
her
depart
,
and
when
I
caught
the
sound
of
her
footsteps
,
I
could
no
longer
control
myself
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
rushed
to
her
daughter
,
and
clasped
her
in
her
arms
.
 
<EOS>
Affectionately
returning
her
mother
's
embrace
,
Amabel
gave
her
hand
to
her
father
,
who
conducted
her
to
the
little
room
overlooking
the
street
.
<EOS>
Nothing
more
,
except
a
deep
and
passionate
look
,
was
exchanged
between
them
.
<EOS>
Both
repressed
their
emotion
,
and
though
the
heart
of
each
was
bursting
,
neither
shed
a
tear
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
,
and
for
the
first
time
,
they
greatly
resembled
each
other
;
and
this
was
not
surprising
,
for
intense
emotion
,
whether
of
grief
or
joy
,
will
bring
out
lines
in
the
features
that
lie
hidden
at
other
times
.
<EOS>
Without
a
word
,
Mr.
Bloundel
busied
himself
in
arranging
the
pulley
;
and
calling
to
those
below
to
prepare
for
Amabel
's
descent
,
again
embraced
her
,
kissed
her
pale
brow
,
and
,
placing
her
carefully
in
the
basket
,
lowered
her
slowly
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
She
was
received
in
safety
by
Leonard
,
who
carried
her
in
his
arms
,
and
placed
her
on
the
pillion
.
<EOS>
The
pulley
was
then
drawn
up
,
and
her
luggage
lowered
by
Mr.
Bloundel
,
and
placed
in
the
saddle
-
bags
by
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
Every
one
saw
the
necessity
of
terminating
this
painful
scene
.
<EOS>
A
kindly
farewell
was
taken
of
Hodges
.
<EOS>
Amabel
waved
her
hand
to
her
father
,
when
at
this
moment
Patience
appeared
at
the
window
,
and
,
calling
to
Blaize
,
threw
a
little
package
tied
in
a
handkerchief
to
him
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
took
up
the
parcel
,
and
gave
it
to
the
porter
,
who
,
untying
the
handkerchief
,
glanced
at
a
note
it
enclosed
,
and
,
striking
his
horse
with
his
stick
,
dashed
off
towards
Cheapside
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pursue
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Amabel
to
Leonard
;
"
he
is
flying
to
the
Earl
of
Rochester
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
intimation
was
sufficient
for
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
Urging
his
horse
into
a
quick
pace
,
he
came
up
with
the
fugitive
,
just
as
he
had
reached
Cheapside
.
<EOS>
Blaize
's
mad
career
had
been
checked
by
Nizza
Macascree
,
who
,
seizing
the
bridle
,
stopped
the
steed
.
<EOS>
Leonard
,
who
was
armed
with
a
heavy
riding
-
whip
,
applied
it
unsparingly
to
Blaize
's
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
"
Entreat
him
to
hold
his
hand
,
dear
,
good
Mistress
Amabel
,
"
cried
the
porter
;
"
it
was
for
your
sake
alone
<EOS>
I
made
this
rash
attempt
.
<EOS>
Patience
told
me
you
were
dying
to
see
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
and
made
me
promise
I
would
ride
to
Whitehall
to
acquaint
his
lordship
whither
you
were
going
.
<EOS>
Here
is
her
letter
which
I
was
about
to
deliver
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
,
he
handed
her
the
note
,
which
was
tied
with
a
piece
of
packthread
,
and
directed
in
strange
and
almost
illegible
characters
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
hurt
him
more
,
"
said
Amabel
;
"
he
was
not
aware
of
the
mischief
he
was
about
to
commit
.
<EOS>
And
learn
from
me
,
Blaize
,
that
,
so
far
from
desiring
to
see
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
all
my
anxiety
is
to
avoid
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
known
that
,
"
returned
the
porter
,
"
I
would
not
have
stirred
a
step
.
<EOS>
But
Patience
assured
me
the
contrary
.
"
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
Doctor
Hodges
had
come
up
,
and
an
explanation
ensued
.
<EOS>
It
was
agreed
,
however
,
that
it
would
be
better
not
to
alarm
Mr.
Bloundel
,
but
to
attribute
the
porter
's
sudden
flight
to
mismanagement
of
his
steed
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
they
returned
to
the
residence
of
the
grocer
,
who
was
anxiously
looking
out
for
them
;
and
after
a
brief
delay
,
during
which
the
saddlebags
were
again
examined
and
secured
,
they
departed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
looked
wistfully
after
his
daughter
,
and
she
returned
his
gaze
as
long
as
her
blinding
eyes
would
permit
her
.
<EOS>
So
unwonted
was
the
sound
of
horses
'
feet
at
this
period
,
that
many
a
melancholy
face
appeared
at
the
window
to
gaze
at
them
as
they
rode
by
,
and
Nizza
Macascree
shuddered
as
she
witnessed
the
envious
glances
cast
after
them
by
these
poor
captives
.
<EOS>
As
to
Blaize
,
when
they
got
into
Cheapside
,
he
was
so
terrified
by
the
dismal
evidences
of
the
pestilence
that
met
him
at
every
turn
,
that
he
could
scarcely
keep
his
seat
,
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
drenched
himself
and
his
companion
with
vinegar
,
and
stuffed
his
mouth
with
myrrh
and
zedoary
,
that
he
felt
anything
like
composure
.
 
<EOS>
On
approaching
Newgate
Market
,
they
found
it
entirely
deserted
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
stalls
were
removed
,
the
shops
closed
,
and
the
window
-
shutters
nailed
up
.
<EOS>
It
was
never
,
in
fact
,
used
at
all
,
except
by
a
few
countrymen
and
higglers
,
who
ventured
thither
on
certain
days
of
the
week
to
sell
fresh
eggs
,
butter
,
poultry
,
and
such
commodities
.
<EOS>
The
manner
of
sale
was
this
.
<EOS>
The
article
disposed
of
was
placed
on
a
flag
on
one
side
of
the
market
,
near
which
stood
a
pump
and
a
trough
of
water
.
<EOS>
The
vendor
then
retired
,
while
the
purchaser
approached
,
took
the
article
,
and
put
its
price
into
the
water
,
whence
it
was
removed
when
supposed
to
be
sufficiently
purified
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
party
passed
Grey
Friars
,
the
tramp
of
their
horses
was
mistaken
for
the
dead
-
cart
,
and
a
door
was
suddenly
opened
and
a
corpse
brought
forth
.
<EOS>
Leonard
would
have
avoided
the
spectacle
had
it
been
possible
,
but
they
were
now
too
close
to
Newgate
,
where
they
were
detained
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
gate
,
while
their
bills
of
health
were
examined
and
countersigned
by
the
officer
stationed
there
.
<EOS>
During
this
pause
Leonard
glanced
at
the
grated
windows
of
the
prison
,
the
debtors
'
side
of
which
fronted
the
street
.
<EOS>
But
not
a
single
face
was
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
as
has
already
been
stated
,
the
prison
was
shut
up
.
 
<EOS>
The
gate
was
now
opened
to
them
,
and
descending
Snow
Hill
<EOS>
they
entered
a
region
completely
devastated
by
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
So
saddening
was
the
sight
,
that
Leonard
involuntarily
quickened
his
horse
's
pace
,
resolved
to
get
out
of
this
forlorn
district
as
speedily
as
possible
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
however
,
stopped
by
an
unexpected
and
fearful
impediment
.
<EOS>
When
within
a
short
distance
of
Holborn
Bridge
,
he
observed
on
the
further
side
of
it
a
large
black
vehicle
,
and
,
unable
to
make
out
what
it
was
,
though
a
fearful
suspicion
crossed
him
,
slackened
his
pace
.
<EOS>
A
nearer
approach
showed
him
that
it
was
the
pest
-
cart
,
filled
with
its
charnel
load
.
<EOS>
The
horse
was
in
the
shafts
,
and
was
standing
quite
still
.
<EOS>
Rising
in
his
stirrups
to
obtain
a
better
view
,
Leonard
perceived
that
the
driver
was
lying
on
the
ground
at
a
little
distance
from
the
cart
,
in
an
attitude
that
proclaimed
he
had
been
suddenly
seized
by
the
pestilence
,
and
had
probably
just
expired
.
 
<EOS>
Not
choosing
to
incur
the
risk
of
passing
this
contagious
load
,
Leonard
retraced
his
course
as
far
as
Holborn
Conduit
,
then
turning
into
Seacole
-
lane
,
and
making
the
best
of
his
way
to
Fleet
Bridge
,
crossed
it
,
and
entered
the
great
thoroughfare
with
which
it
communicated
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
proceeded
far
when
he
encountered
a
small
party
of
the
watch
,
to
whom
he
showed
his
certificate
,
and
recounted
the
fate
of
the
driver
of
the
dead
-
cart
.
<EOS>
At
Temple
Bar
he
was
again
obliged
to
exhibit
his
passports
;
and
while
there
detained
,
he
observed
three
other
horsemen
riding
towards
them
from
the
further
end
of
Fleet
-
street
.
 
<EOS>
Though
much
alarmed
by
the
sight
,
Leonard
did
not
communicate
his
apprehensions
to
his
companions
,
but
as
soon
as
the
guard
allowed
him
to
pass
,
called
out
to
Blaize
to
follow
him
,
and
urging
his
horse
to
a
quick
pace
,
dashed
up
Drury
-
lane
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
'
hard
riding
,
during
which
nothing
occurred
to
give
the
apprentice
further
uneasiness
,
brought
them
to
a
road
skirting
the
open
fields
,
in
which
a
pest
-
house
had
just
been
built
by
the
chivalrous
nobleman
whose
habitation
in
Berkshire
they
were
about
to
visit
.
<EOS>
With
a
courage
and
devotion
that
redound
more
to
his
honour
than
the
brilliant
qualities
that
won
him
so
high
<EOS>
a
reputation
in
the
court
and
in
the
field
<EOS>
,
Lord
Craven
not
merely
provided
the
present
receptacle
for
the
sick
,
but
remained
in
London
during
the
whole
continuance
of
the
dreadful
visitation
;
"
braving
,
"
says
Pennant
,
"
the
fury
of
the
pestilence
with
the
same
coolness
that
he
fought
the
battles
of
his
beloved
mistress
,
Elizabeth
,
titular
Queen
of
Bohemia
,
or
mounted
the
tremendous
breach
of
Creutznach
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
spot
where
this
asylum
was
built
,
and
which
is
the
present
site
of
Golden
-
square
,
retained
nearly
half
a
century
afterwards
,
the
name
of
the
Pest
-
house
Fields
.
<EOS>
Leonard
had
already
been
made
acquainted
by
Doctor
Hodges
with
the
earl
's
generous
devotion
to
the
public
welfare
,
and
warmly
commenting
upon
it
,
he
pointed
out
the
structure
to
Amabel
.
<EOS>
But
the
speed
at
which
she
was
borne
along
did
not
allow
her
time
to
bestow
more
than
a
hasty
glance
at
it
.
<EOS>
On
gaining
Hyde
-
park
Corner
,
the
apprentice
cast
a
look
backwards
,
and
his
apprehensions
were
revived
by
perceiving
the
three
horsemen
again
in
view
,
and
evidently
using
their
utmost
exertions
to
come
up
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
While
Leonard
was
hesitating
whether
he
should
make
known
their
danger
to
Amabel
,
he
perceived
Solomon
Eagle
dart
from
behind
a
wall
on
the
left
of
the
road
,
and
plant
himself
in
the
direct
course
of
their
pursuers
,
and
he
involuntarily
drew
in
the
rein
to
see
what
would
ensue
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
,
the
horsemen
,
who
were
advancing
at
full
gallop
,
and
whom
Leonard
now
recognised
as
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
Pillichody
,
and
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
,
had
approached
within
a
few
yards
of
the
enthusiast
,
and
threatened
to
ride
over
him
if
he
did
not
get
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
Seeing
,
however
,
that
he
did
not
offer
to
move
,
they
opened
on
either
side
of
him
,
and
were
passing
swiftly
by
,
when
,
with
infinite
dexterity
,
he
caught
hold
of
the
bridle
of
Rochester
's
steed
,
and
checking
him
,
seized
the
earl
by
the
leg
,
and
threw
him
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
pulled
up
as
soon
as
he
could
,
and
,
drawing
his
sword
,
rode
back
to
assist
his
friend
,
and
punish
the
aggressor
;
but
the
enthusiast
,
nothing
daunted
,
met
him
in
full
career
,
and
suddenly
lifting
up
his
arms
,
uttered
a
loud
cry
,
which
so
startled
the
knight
's
high
-
spirited
horse
,
that
it
reared
and
flung
him
.
<EOS>
All
this
was
the
work
of
a
few
seconds
.
<EOS>
Pillichody
had
been
borne
forward
by
the
impetuosity
of
his
steed
to
within
a
short
distance
of
the
apprentice
,
and
seeing
the
fate
of
his
companions
,
and
not
liking
Leonard
's
menacing
gestures
,
he
chipped
spurs
into
his
horse
,
and
rode
up
Park
-
lane
.
 
<EOS>
Overjoyed
at
his
unexpected
deliverance
,
Leonard
,
whose
attention
had
been
completely
engrossed
by
what
was
passing
,
now
ventured
to
look
at
Amabel
,
and
became
greatly
alarmed
at
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
She
was
as
pale
as
death
,
except
a
small
scarlet
patch
on
either
cheek
,
which
contrasted
powerfully
with
the
death
-
like
hue
of
the
rest
of
her
countenance
.
<EOS>
Her
hands
convulsively
clasped
the
back
of
the
pillion
;
her
lips
were
slightly
apart
,
and
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
prostrate
form
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
On
finding
they
were
pursued
,
and
by
whom
,
her
first
impulse
had
been
to
fling
herself
from
the
pillion
,
and
to
seek
safety
by
flight
;
but
controlling
herself
,
she
awaited
the
result
with
forced
composure
,
and
was
now
sinking
from
the
exhaustion
of
the
effort
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
we
are
safe
,
"
cried
the
apprentice
;
"
but
I
fear
the
shock
has
been
too
much
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
has
,
"
gasped
Amabel
,
falling
against
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
fly
--
<EOS>
oh
!
let
us
fly
.
"
 
<EOS>
Inexpressibly
shocked
and
alarmed
,
Leonard
twined
his
left
arm
round
her
waist
so
as
to
hold
her
on
the
steed
,
for
she
was
utterly
unable
to
support
herself
,
and
glancing
anxiously
at
Nizza
Macascree
,
struck
off
on
the
right
into
the
road
skirting
the
Park
,
and
in
the
direction
of
Tyburn
,
where
there
was
a
small
inn
,
at
which
he
hoped
to
procure
assistance
.
<EOS>
Before
reaching
this
place
,
he
was
beyond
description
relieved
to
find
that
Amabel
had
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
raise
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
deadly
faintness
is
passed
,
"
she
murmured
;
"
I
shall
be
better
soon
.
<EOS>
But
I
fear
I
am
too
weak
to
pursue
the
journey
at
present
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
spurred
on
his
steed
,
and
in
another
instant
reached
Tyburn
,
and
drew
up
at
the
little
inn
.
<EOS>
But
no
assistance
could
be
obtained
there
.
<EOS>
The
house
was
closed
;
there
was
a
red
cross
on
the
door
;
and
a
watchman
,
stationed
in
front
of
it
,
informed
him
that
all
the
family
had
died
of
the
plague
except
the
landlord--"and
he
will
be
buried
beside
them
in
Paddington
churchyard
before
to
-
morrow
morning
,
"
added
the
man
;
"
for
his
nurse
tells
me
it
is
impossible
he
can
survive
many
hours
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
an
upper
window
was
opened
,
and
a
woman
,
thrusting
forth
her
head
,
cried
,
"
Poor
Master
Sandys
has
just
breathed
his
last
.
<EOS>
Come
in
,
Philip
,
and
help
me
to
prepare
the
body
for
the
dead
-
cart
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
with
you
in
a
minute
,
"
rejoined
the
watchman
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
possibly
procure
accommodation
at
the
Wheatsheaf
at
Paddington
,
"
he
added
to
Leonard
;
"
it
is
but
a
short
distance
up
the
road
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thanking
him
for
the
information
,
Leonard
took
the
course
indicated
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
proceeded
far
,
when
he
was
alarmed
by
hearing
a
piteous
cry
of
"
Stop
!
<EOS>
stop
!
"
<EOS>
proceeding
from
Blaize
;
and
,
halting
,
found
that
the
porter
had
been
so
greatly
terrified
by
the
watchman
's
account
of
the
frightful
mortality
in
the
poor
innkeeper
's
family
,
that
he
had
applied
to
his
phial
of
plague
-
water
,
and
in
pulling
it
put
had
dropped
his
box
of
rufuses
,
and
the
jar
of
anti
-
pestilential
confection
.
<EOS>
He
had
just
ascertained
his
loss
,
and
wished
to
go
back
,
but
this
Nizza
Macascree
would
not
permit
.
<EOS>
Enraged
at
the
delay
,
Leonard
peremptorily
ordered
the
porter
to
come
on
;
and
Blaize
,
casting
a
rueful
glance
at
his
treasures
,
which
he
perceived
at
a
little
distance
in
the
middle
of
the
road
,
was
compelled
to
obey
.
 
<EOS>
At
Paddington
,
another
disappointment
awaited
them
.
<EOS>
The
Wheatsheaf
was
occupied
by
two
large
families
,
who
were
flying
from
the
infected
city
,
and
no
accommodation
could
be
obtained
.
<EOS>
Leonard
looked
wistfully
at
Nizza
Macascree
,
as
if
to
ascertain
what
to
do
,
and
she
was
equally
perplexed
;
but
the
difficulty
was
relieved
by
Amabel
herself
,
who
said
she
felt
much
better
,
and
able
to
proceed
a
little
further
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
return
to
London
,
"
she
continued
with
great
earnestness
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
die
on
the
road
than
go
home
again
.
<EOS>
Some
cottage
will
receive
us
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
I
can
rest
for
a
short
time
in
the
fields
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thinking
it
best
to
comply
,
Leonard
proceeded
along
the
Harrow
-
road
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
crossing
Paddington
Green
,
he
overtook
a
little
train
of
fugitives
driving
a
cart
filled
with
children
,
and
laden
with
luggage
.
<EOS>
Further
on
,
as
he
surveyed
the
beautiful
meadows
,
stretching
out
on
either
side
of
him
,
he
perceived
a
line
of
small
tents
,
resembling
a
gipsy
encampment
,
pitched
at
a
certain
distance
from
each
other
,
and
evidently
occupied
by
families
who
had
fled
from
their
homes
from
fear
of
infection
.
<EOS>
This
gave
a
singular
character
to
the
prospect
.
<EOS>
But
there
were
other
and
far
more
painful
sights
on
the
road
,
which
could
not
fail
to
attract
attention
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
half
-
mile
,
almost
at
every
hundred
yards
might
be
seen
some
sick
man
,
who
,
unable
to
proceed
further
,
had
fallen
against
the
hedge
-
side
,
and
exhibited
his
sores
to
move
the
pity
of
the
passers
-
by
.
<EOS>
But
these
supplications
were
wholly
unheeded
.
<EOS>
Self
-
preservation
was
the
first
object
with
all
,
and
the
travellers
holding
handkerchiefs
steeped
in
vinegar
to
their
faces
,
and
averting
their
heads
,
passed
by
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
The
pestilence
,
it
may
be
remarked
,
had
visited
with
extraordinary
rigour
the
whole
of
the
higher
country
at
the
west
and
north
-
west
of
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
The
charmingly
-
situated
,
and
,
at
other
seasons
,
healthful
villages
of
Hampstead
and
Highgate
,
suffered
severely
from
the
scourge
;
and
it
even
extended
its
ravages
as
far
as
Harrow
-
on
-
the
-
Hill
,
which
it
half
depopulated
.
<EOS>
This
will
account
for
the
circumstance
of
a
large
pest
-
house
being
erected
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Westbourne
Green
,
which
the
party
now
approached
.
<EOS>
Two
litters
were
seen
crossing
the
fields
in
the
direction
of
the
hospital
,
and
this
circumstance
called
Leonard
's
attention
to
it
.
<EOS>
Shudderingly
averting
his
gaze
,
he
quickened
his
pace
,
and
soon
reached
a
small
farmhouse
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
rising
from
Kensal
Green
.
<EOS>
Determined
to
seek
a
temporary
asylum
here
for
Amabel
,
he
opened
a
gate
,
and
,
riding
into
the
yard
,
fortunately
met
with
owner
of
the
house
,
a
worthy
farmer
,
named
Wingfield
,
to
whom
he
explained
her
situation
.
<EOS>
The
man
at
first
hesitated
,
but
,
on
receiving
Leonard
's
solemn
assurance
that
she
was
free
from
the
plague
,
consented
to
receive
the
whole
party
.
 
<EOS>
Assisting
Amabel
to
dismount
<EOS>
,
Wingfield
conveyed
her
in
his
arms
into
the
house
,
and
delivered
her
to
his
wife
,
bidding
her
take
care
of
her
.
<EOS>
The
injunction
was
scarcely
needed
.
<EOS>
The
good
dame
,
who
was
a
middle
-
aged
woman
,
with
pleasing
features
,
which
lost
none
of
their
interest
from
being
stamped
with
profound
melancholy
,
gazed
at
her
for
a
moment
fixedly
,
and
then
observed
in
an
under
-
tone
,
but
with
much
emotion
,
to
her
husband
,
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Robert
,
how
much
this
sweet
creature
resembles
our
poor
Sarah
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
hush
!
<EOS>
dame
,
"
rejoined
her
husband
,
hastily
brushing
away
the
moisture
that
sprang
to
his
eyes
;
"
take
her
to
your
chamber
,
and
see
that
she
wants
nothing
.
<EOS>
There
is
another
young
woman
outside
,
whom
I
will
send
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
returned
to
the
yard
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
the
others
had
dismounted
,
and
Wingfield
,
bidding
Nizza
Macascree
go
in
,
led
the
way
to
the
barn
,
where
the
horses
were
tied
up
,
and
fodder
placed
before
them
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
conducted
his
guests
to
the
house
,
and
placing
cold
meat
,
bread
,
and
a
jug
of
ale
before
them
,
desired
them
to
fall
to
--
an
injunction
which
Blaize
,
notwithstanding
his
previous
repast
of
roasted
figs
and
pickled
walnuts
,
very
readily
complied
with
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
thus
employed
,
Dame
Wingfield
made
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
She
said
that
the
poor
creature
(
meaning
Amabel
)
was
too
ill
to
proceed
on
her
journey
that
day
,
and
begged
her
husband
to
allow
her
to
stop
till
the
next
morning
,
when
she
hoped
she
would
be
able
to
undertake
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
morning
,
say
you
dame
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Wingfield
;
"
she
may
stop
till
the
day
after
,
and
the
day
after
that
,
if
you
desire
it
,
or
she
wishes
it
.
<EOS>
Go
tell
her
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
his
wife
withdrew
,
well
pleased
at
having
obtained
her
request
,
Wingfield
addressed
himself
to
Leonard
,
and
inquired
the
cause
of
Amabel
's
illness
;
and
as
the
apprentice
saw
no
necessity
for
secresy
,
and
felt
exceedingly
grateful
for
the
kind
treatment
he
had
experienced
,
he
acquainted
him
with
the
chief
particulars
of
her
history
.
<EOS>
The
farmer
appeared
greatly
moved
by
the
recital
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
resembles
my
poor
Sarah
very
strongly
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
My
daughter
was
hurried
into
an
early
grave
by
a
villain
who
won
her
affections
and
betrayed
her
.
<EOS>
She
now
lies
in
Willesden
churchyard
,
but
her
seducer
is
one
of
the
chief
favourites
of
our
profligate
monarch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
the
Earl
of
Rochester
?
"
cried
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
replied
the
farmer
,
whose
good
-
natured
countenance
had
assumed
a
stern
expression
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
villain
I
mean
is
worse
,
if
possible
,
than
the
earl
.
<EOS>
He
is
called
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Gracious
Heaven
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Leonard
,
in
astonishment
;
"
what
a
strange
coincidence
is
this
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
then
proceeded
to
relate
to
Wingfield
the
persecution
which
Nizza
Macascree
had
endured
from
the
profligate
knight
The
farmer
listened
to
his
recital
with
breathless
interest
,
and
when
it
was
ended
arose
,
and
,
taking
a
hasty
turn
round
the
room
,
halted
at
the
table
and
struck
it
forcibly
with
his
clenched
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
that
man
will
never
cross
my
path
,
"
he
said
,
all
the
blood
mounting
to
his
face
,
and
his
eye
kindling
with
fury
.
<EOS>
"
As
God
shall
judge
me
,
I
will
kill
him
if
I
meet
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
hope
you
never
will
meet
him
,
"
observed
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
injured
you
enough
already
,
without
putting
you
out
of
the
pale
of
Divine
mercy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
These
rascals
have
done
us
all
an
injury
,
"
observed
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
Patience
has
never
been
like
herself
since
Major
Pillichody
entered
my
master
's
dwelling
,
and
made
love
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
feel
quite
uneasy
to
think
how
the
little
hussy
will
go
on
during
my
absence
.
<EOS>
She
ca
n't
get
out
of
the
house
,
that
's
one
comfort
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
mentioned
another
wretch
,
who
was
constantly
with
Sir
Paul
,
"
cried
Wingfield
.
"
<EOS>
Perdition
seize
them
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
perdition
seize
them
!
"
echoed
Blaize
,
striking
the
table
in
his
turn--"especially
Major
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
suspect
Sir
Paul
to
be
of
higher
rank
than
he
pretends
?
"
asked
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
rejoined
Wingfield
;
"
what
motive
have
you
for
the
question
?
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
then
told
him
of
the
inquiries
instituted
by
Doctor
Hodges
relative
to
Nizza
's
retreat
,
and
how
they
had
been
baffled
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
strange
,
"
he
continued
,
"
that
Nizza
herself
never
heard
the
real
name
of
her
persecutor
;
neither
can
she
tell
where
the
house
to
which
she
was
conveyed
,
when
in
a
fainting
condition
,
and
from
which
she
was
removed
when
attacked
with
the
plague
,
is
situated
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
strange
indeed
,
"
observed
the
farmer
,
musingly
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
Nizza
Macascree
made
her
appearance
,
and
informed
them
that
Amabel
had
fallen
into
a
tranquil
slumber
,
which
,
in
all
probability
,
would
completely
renovate
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
will
,
"
said
Wingfield
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
not
part
with
her
to
-
day
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
entered
into
conversation
with
Nizza
,
and
after
a
little
time
,
proposed
to
her
and
Leonard
to
walk
across
the
fields
with
him
to
Willesden
,
to
visit
his
daughter
's
grave
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
wife
will
take
charge
of
Amabel
,
"
he
said
;
"
you
may
safely
trust
her
in
her
hands
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
could
raise
no
objection
,
except
the
possibility
that
the
Earl
of
Rochester
and
his
companions
might
discover
their
retreat
,
and
carry
off
Amabel
in
his
absence
;
but
,
after
a
little
reflection
,
considering
this
altogether
unlikely
,
he
assented
,
and
they
set
out
.
<EOS>
A
pleasant
walk
across
the
fields
brought
them
to
the
pretty
little
village
of
Willesden
and
its
old
and
beautiful
church
.
<EOS>
They
proceeded
to
the
grave
of
poor
Sarah
Wingfield
,
which
lay
at
the
east
of
the
church
,
beneath
one
of
the
tall
elms
,
and
Nizza
,
as
she
stood
by
the
rounded
sod
covering
the
remains
of
the
unfortunate
girl
,
could
not
restrain
her
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
might
have
been
my
own
fate
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
an
escape
I
have
had
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
bring
you
here
to
read
you
a
lesson
,
"
said
Wingfield
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
emotion
,
"
but
because
you
,
who
know
the
temptation
to
which
the
poor
creature
who
lies
there
was
exposed
,
will
pity
her
.
<EOS>
Not
alone
did
remorse
for
her
conduct
prey
upon
her
spirits
--
not
alone
<EOS>
did
she
suffer
from
self
-
<EOS>
reproach,--but
<EOS>
the
scoffs
and
jeers
of
her
sex
,
who
never
forgive
an
erring
sister
,
broke
her
heart
.
<EOS>
She
is
now
,
however
,
beyond
the
reach
of
human
malice
,
and
,
I
trust
,
at
peace
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
,
he
walked
away
to
hide
his
emotion
,
and
presently
afterwards
rejoining
them
,
they
quitted
the
churchyard
together
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
recrossed
the
fields
,
Wingfield
observed
two
men
digging
a
hole
in
the
ground
,
and
,
guessing
their
object
,
paused
for
a
few
minutes
to
watch
them
.
<EOS>
Having
thrown
out
the
earth
to
the
depth
of
a
couple
of
feet
,
one
of
them
took
a
long
hooked
pole
,
and
attaching
it
to
the
body
of
a
victim
to
the
pestilence
,
who
had
wandered
into
the
fields
and
died
there
,
dragged
it
towards
the
pit
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
corpse
was
pushed
into
its
narrow
receptacle
,
the
clay
was
shovelled
over
it
,
and
trodden
down
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
sad
mode
of
burial
for
a
Christian
,
"
observed
Wingfield
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
would
not
do
to
leave
an
infected
body
to
rot
in
the
fields
,
and
spread
the
contagion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Such
a
grave
is
better
than
the
plague
-
pit
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
,
recalling
the
frightful
scenes
he
had
witnessed
there
.
 
<EOS>
On
reaching
Wingfield
's
dwelling
,
they
found
from
the
good
dame
,
that
Amabel
had
awakened
from
her
slumber
greatly
refreshed
;
but
she
gave
it
as
her
opinion
that
she
had
better
remain
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
no
one
went
into
the
room
to
her
except
Nizza
Macascree
.
<EOS>
A
substantial
dinner
was
provided
for
his
guests
by
the
hospitable
farmer
;
and
Blaize
,
who
had
been
for
some
time
confined
to
salt
provisions
at
his
master
's
house
,
did
ample
justice
to
the
fresh
meat
and
vegetables
.
 
<EOS>
The
meal
over
,
Leonard
,
who
felt
exceedingly
curious
to
learn
what
had
become
of
the
mysterious
stranger
whose
child
he
had
carried
to
the
plague
-
pit
,
and
who
had
appeared
so
strangely
interested
in
Nizza
Macascree
,
determined
to
walk
to
the
pest
-
house
in
Finsbury
Fields
and
inquire
after
him
.
<EOS>
On
communicating
his
intention
to
his
host
,
Wingfield
would
have
dissuaded
him
;
but
as
Leonard
affirmed
he
had
no
fear
of
infection
,
he
desisted
from
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
Just
as
the
apprentice
was
starting
,
Blaize
came
up
to
him
,
and
said,--"Leonard
,
I
have
a
great
curiosity
to
see
a
pest
-
house
,
and
should
like
to
go
with
you
,
if
you
will
let
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
apprentice
stared
at
him
in
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
never
dare
to
enter
it
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
wherever
you
go
,
"
replied
the
porter
,
with
a
confidence
mainly
inspired
by
the
hospitable
farmer
's
strong
ale
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
keep
you
to
your
word
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
less
than
an
hour
they
reached
Marylebone
Fields
(
now
the
Regent
's
Park
)
,
and
,
crossing
them
,
entered
a
lane
,
running
in
pretty
nearly
the
same
direction
as
the
present
New
-
road
.
<EOS>
It
Drought
them
to
Clerkenwell
,
whence
they
proceeded
to
Finsbury
Fields
,
and
soon
came
in
sight
of
the
pest
-
house
.
<EOS>
When
Blaize
found
himself
so
near
this
dreaded
asylum
,
all
his
courage
vanished
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
certainly
enter
the
pest
-
house
with
you
,
"
he
said
to
Leonard
,
"
but
I
have
used
up
all
my
vinegar
,
and
you
know
I
lost
my
box
of
rufuses
and
the
pot
of
anti
-
pestilential
confection
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
excuse
shall
not
serve
your
turn
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
get
plenty
of
vinegar
and
plague
medicine
in
the
pest
-
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
no
money
to
pay
for
them
,
"
rejoined
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
lend
you
some
,
"
said
Leonard
,
placing
a
few
pieces
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
come
along
.
"
 
<EOS>
Blaize
would
fain
have
run
away
,
but
,
afraid
of
incurring
the
apprentice
's
anger
,
he
walked
tremblingly
after
him
.
<EOS>
They
entered
the
garden
-
gate
,
and
soon
reached
the
principal
door
,
which
,
as
usual
,
stood
open
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
able
to
support
himself
,
the
porter
tottered
into
the
large
room
;
but
as
he
cast
his
eyes
around
,
and
beheld
the
miserable
occupants
of
the
pallets
,
and
heard
their
cries
and
groans
,
he
was
so
scared
that
he
could
not
move
another
step
,
but
stood
like
one
transfixed
with
terror
.
<EOS>
Paying
little
attention
to
him
,
Leonard
walked
forward
,
and
at
the
further
extremity
of
the
chamber
found
the
young
chirurgeon
whom
he
had
formerly
seen
,
and
describing
the
stranger
,
inquired
where
he
was
placed
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
person
you
allude
to
has
been
removed
,
"
returned
the
chirurgeon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
visited
him
this
morning
,
and
had
him
conveyed
to
his
own
dwelling
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Was
he
sensible
at
the
time
?
"
asked
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
"
replied
the
chirurgeon
;
"
but
the
doctor
appeared
to
recognise
in
him
an
old
friend
,
though
I
did
not
hear
him
mention
his
name
;
and
it
was
on
that
account
,
I
conclude
,
that
he
had
him
removed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
he
likely
to
recover
?
"
asked
Leonard
,
whose
curiosity
was
aroused
by
what
he
heard
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
impossible
to
say
,
"
replied
the
young
man
.
"
<EOS>
But
he
can
not
be
in
better
hands
than
those
of
Doctor
Hodges
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
perfectly
concurred
with
him
,
and
,
after
a
few
minutes
'
further
conversation
,
turned
to
depart
.
<EOS>
Not
seeing
Blaize
,
he
concluded
he
had
gone
forth
,
and
expected
to
find
him
in
the
garden
,
or
,
at
all
events
,
in
the
field
adjoining
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
While
wondering
what
had
become
of
him
,
Leonard
heard
a
loud
cry
,
in
the
voice
of
the
porter
,
issuing
from
the
barn
,
which
,
as
has
already
been
stated
,
had
been
converted
into
a
receptacle
for
the
sick
;
and
hurrying
thither
,
he
found
Blaize
in
the
hands
of
two
stout
assistants
,
who
had
stripped
him
of
his
clothes
,
and
were
tying
him
down
to
a
pallet
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
Leonard
,
Blaize
implored
him
to
deliver
him
from
the
hands
of
his
persecutors
;
and
the
apprentice
assuring
the
assistants
that
the
poor
fellow
was
perfectly
free
from
infection
,
they
liberated
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
,
on
inquiry
,
that
Blaize
had
fallen
against
one
of
the
pallets
in
a
state
almost
of
insensibility
,
and
the
two
assistants
,
chancing
to
pass
at
the
time
,
and
taking
him
for
a
plague
patient
,
had
conveyed
him
to
the
barn
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
it
,
he
recovered
,
and
besought
them
to
set
him
free
,
but
they
paid
no
attention
to
his
cries
,
and
proceeded
to
strip
him
,
and
bind
him
to
the
bed
,
as
before
related
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
released
,
the
porter
lost
no
time
in
dressing
himself
;
and
Leonard
,
to
allay
his
terrors
,
had
a
strong
dose
of
anti
-
pestilential
elixir
administered
to
him
.
<EOS>
After
which
,
having
procured
him
a
box
of
rufuses
,
and
a
phial
of
plague
-
water
,
Blaize
shook
off
his
apprehension
,
and
they
set
out
at
a
brisk
pace
for
Kensal
Green
.
  
<EOS>
VII
.
 
<EOS>
THE
JOURNEY
.
 
<EOS>
Blaize
was
destined
to
experience
a
second
fright
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
mentioned
that
the
infected
were
sometimes
seized
with
a
rabid
desire
of
communicating
the
disorder
to
such
as
had
not
been
attacked
by
it
;
and
as
the
pair
were
making
the
best
of
their
way
along
the
Harrow
-
road
,
a
poor
lazar
who
was
lying
against
the
hedge
-
side
,
and
had
vainly
implored
their
assistance
,
suddenly
started
up
,
and
with
furious
cries
and
gestures
made
towards
the
porter
.
<EOS>
Guessing
his
intention
,
Blaize
took
to
his
heels
,
and
,
folding
himself
closely
pressed
,
broke
through
the
hedge
on
the
right
,
and
speeded
across
the
field
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
the
alarming
nature
of
the
occurrence
,
the
apprentice
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
unwonted
agility
displayed
by
the
fat
little
porter
,
who
ran
so
swiftly
that
it
appeared
probable
he
would
distance
his
pursuer
.
<EOS>
To
prevent
mischief
,
however
,
Leonard
set
off
after
him
,
and
was
fast
gaining
upon
the
lazar
,
whose
strength
was
evidently
failing
,
when
the
poor
wretch
uttered
a
loud
cry
,
and
fell
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
On
coming
up
,
Leonard
found
him
lying
with
his
face
in
the
grass
,
and
convulsed
by
the
agonies
of
death
,
and
perceiving
that
all
was
over
,
hurried
after
the
porter
,
whom
he
found
seated
on
a
gate
,
at
the
further
end
of
the
field
,
solacing
himself
with
a
draught
of
plague
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Leonard
!
<EOS>
"
groaned
the
latter
,
"
how
little
do
we
know
what
is
for
our
good
!
<EOS>
I
was
delighted
to
quit
my
master
's
house
this
morning
,
but
I
now
wish
with
,
all
my
heart
<EOS>
I
was
back
again
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
I
shall
die
of
the
plague
after
all
.
<EOS>
Pray
what
are
the
first
symptoms
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
<EOS>
pooh
!
<EOS>
do
n't
think
about
it
,
and
you
will
take
no
harm
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
Put
by
your
phial
,
and
let
us
make
the
best
of
our
way
to
Farmer
Wingfield
's
dwelling
.
"
 
<EOS>
Being
now
in
sight
of
the
farm
,
which
,
from
its
elevated
situation
,
could
be
distinguished
at
a
distance
of
two
miles
in
this
direction
,
they
easily
shaped
their
course
towards
it
across
the
fields
.
<EOS>
When
about
halfway
up
the
hill
,
Leonard
paused
to
look
behind
him
.
<EOS>
The
view
was
exquisite
,
and
it
was
precisely
the
hour
(
just
before
sunset
)
at
which
it
could
be
seen
to
the
greatest
advantage
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
,
his
gaze
wandered
to
the
beautiful
and
well
-
wooded
heights
of
Richmond
and
Wimbledon
,
beyond
which
he
could
trace
the
long
line
of
the
Surrey
hills
,
while
nearer
he
perceived
Notting
Hill
,
now
covered
with
habitations
,
but
then
a
verdant
knoll
,
crowned
by
a
few
trees
,
but
without
so
much
as
a
cottage
upon
it
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
stood
Hampstead
;
at
that
time
a
collection
of
pretty
cottages
,
but
wanting
its
present
chief
ornament
,
the
church
.
<EOS>
At
the
foot
of
the
hill
rich
meadows
,
bordered
with
fine
hedges
,
interspersed
with
well
-
grown
timber
,
spread
out
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
.
<EOS>
Nothing
destroyed
the
rural
character
of
the
prospect
;
nor
was
there
any
indication
of
the
neighbourhood
of
a
great
city
,
except
the
lofty
tower
and
massive
body
of
Saint
Paul
's
,
which
appeared
above
the
tops
of
the
intervening
trees
in
the
distance
.
 
<EOS>
As
on
former
occasions
,
when
contemplating
the
surrounding
country
from
the
summit
of
the
cathedral
,
Leonard
could
not
help
contrasting
the
beauty
of
the
scene
before
him
with
the
horrible
scourge
by
which
it
was
ravaged
.
<EOS>
Never
had
the
country
looked
so
beautiful
--
never
,
therefore
,
was
the
contrast
so
forcible
;
and
it
appeared
to
him
like
a
lovely
mask
hiding
the
hideous
and
ghastly
features
of
death
.
<EOS>
Tinged
by
the
sombre
hue
of
his
thoughts
,
the
whole
scene
changed
its
complexion
.
<EOS>
The
smiling
landscape
seemed
to
darken
,
and
the
cool
air
of
evening
to
become
hot
and
noisome
,
as
if
laden
with
the
deadly
exhalations
of
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
the
workings
of
his
imagination
stop
here
.
<EOS>
He
fancied
even
at
this
distance
--
nearly
seven
miles
--
that
he
could
discern
Solomon
Eagle
on
the
summit
of
Saint
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
At
first
the
figure
looked
like
a
small
black
speck
;
but
it
gradually
dilated
,
until
it
became
twice
the
size
of
the
cathedral
,
upon
the
central
tower
of
which
its
feet
rested
,
while
its
arms
were
spread
abroad
over
the
city
.
<EOS>
In
its
right
hand
the
gigantic
figure
held
a
blazing
torch
,
and
in
the
left
a
phial
,
from
the
mouth
of
which
a
stream
of
dark
liquid
descended
.
<EOS>
So
vividly
did
this
phantasm
present
itself
to
Leonard
,
that
,
almost
convinced
of
its
reality
,
he
placed
his
hands
before
his
eyes
for
a
few
moments
,
and
,
on
withdrawing
them
,
was
glad
to
find
that
the
delusion
was
occasioned
by
a
black
cloud
over
the
cathedral
,
which
his
distempered
fancy
had
converted
into
the
colossal
figure
of
the
enthusiast
.
 
<EOS>
Blaize
,
who
had
taken
the
opportunity
of
his
companion
's
abstraction
to
sip
a
little
more
plague
-
water
,
now
approached
,
and
told
him
that
Wingfield
was
descending
the
hill
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
Rousing
himself
,
Leonard
ran
towards
the
farmer
,
who
appeared
delighted
to
see
them
back
again
,
and
conducted
them
to
his
dwelling
.
<EOS>
Owing
to
the
tender
and
truly
maternal
attention
of
Dame
Wingfield
,
Amabel
was
so
much
better
that
she
was
able
to
join
the
party
at
supper
,
though
she
took
no
share
in
the
meal
.
<EOS>
Wingfield
listened
to
the
soft
tones
of
her
voice
as
she
conversed
with
his
wife
,
and
at
last
,
unable
to
control
his
emotion
,
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
quitted
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
with
your
husband
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Amabel
of
her
hostess
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
is
not
unwell
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
no
,
"
replied
the
good
dame
;
"
your
voice
reminds
him
of
our
daughter
,
whose
history
I
have
related
to
you
--
that
is
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
"
exclaimed
Amabel
,
with
a
sympathizing
look
,
"
I
will
be
silent
,
if
it
pains
him
to
hear
me
speak
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
no
account
,
"
rejoined
Dame
Wingfield
.
<EOS>
"
The
tears
he
has
shed
will
relieve
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
weep
when
poor
Sarah
died
,
and
I
feared
his
heart
would
break
.
<EOS>
Talk
to
him
as
you
have
talked
to
me
,
and
you
will
do
him
a
world
of
good
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
the
farmer
returned
to
the
table
,
and
the
meal
proceeded
to
its
close
without
further
interruption
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
board
was
cleared
,
Wingfield
took
a
chair
by
Amabel
,
who
,
in
compliance
with
his
wife
's
request
,
spoke
to
him
about
his
daughter
,
and
in
terms
calculated
to
afford
him
consolation
.
<EOS>
Leonard
was
enraptured
by
her
discourse
,
and
put
so
little
constraint
upon
his
admiration
,
that
Nizza
Macascree
could
not
repress
a
pang
of
jealousy
.
<EOS>
As
to
Blaize
,
who
had
eaten
as
much
as
he
could
cram
,
and
emptied
a
large
jug
of
the
farmer
's
stout
ale
,
he
took
his
chair
to
a
corner
,
and
speedily
fell
asleep
;
his
hoarse
but
tranquil
breathing
proving
that
the
alarms
he
had
undergone
during
the
day
did
not
haunt
his
slumbers
.
<EOS>
Before
separating
for
the
night
,
Amabel
entreated
that
prayers
might
be
said
,
and
her
request
being
readily
granted
,
she
was
about
to
retire
with
Nizza
,
when
Wingfield
detained
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
thinking
that
I
might
offer
you
a
safe
asylum
here
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
like
it
,
you
shall
remain
with
us
till
your
health
is
fully
reinstated
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
most
kindly
for
the
offer
,
"
returned
Amabel
,
gratefully
;
"
and
if
I
do
not
accept
it
,
it
is
neither
because
I
should
not
esteem
myself
safe
here
,
nor
because
I
am
unwilling
to
be
indebted
to
your
hospitality
,
but
that
I
have
been
specially
advised
,
as
my
last
chance
of
recovery
,
to
try
the
air
of
Berkshire
.
<EOS>
I
have
little
hope
myself
,
but
I
owe
it
to
those
who
love
me
to
make
the
experiment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
such
is
the
case
,
"
returned
the
farmer
,
"
I
will
not
attempt
to
persuade
you
further
.
<EOS>
But
if
at
any
future
time
you
should
need
change
of
air
,
my
house
shall
be
entirely
at
your
service
.
"
 
<EOS>
Dame
Wingfield
warmly
seconded
her
husband
's
wish
,
and
,
with
renewed
thanks
,
Amabel
and
her
companion
withdrew
.
<EOS>
As
there
was
not
sufficient
room
for
their
accommodation
within
the
house
,
Leonard
and
the
porter
took
up
their
quarters
in
the
barn
,
and
,
throwing
themselves
upon
a
heap
of
straw
,
slept
soundly
till
three
o'clock
,
when
they
arose
and
began
to
prepare
for
their
journey
.
<EOS>
Wingfield
was
likewise
astir
,
and
,
after
assisting
them
to
feed
and
dress
their
horses
,
took
them
into
the
house
,
where
a
plentiful
breakfast
awaited
them
.
<EOS>
At
the
close
of
the
meal
,
Amabel
and
Nizza
,
who
had
breakfasted
in
their
own
room
,
made
their
appearance
.
<EOS>
All
being
in
readiness
for
their
departure
,
Dame
Wingfield
took
leave
of
her
guests
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
and
the
honest
farmer
was
little
less
affected
.
<EOS>
Both
gazed
after
them
as
long
as
they
continued
in
sight
.
 
<EOS>
Having
ascertained
from
Wingfield
the
route
they
ought
to
pursue
,
Leonard
proceeded
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
along
the
Harrow
-
road
,
and
then
turned
off
on
the
left
into
a
common
,
which
brought
them
to
Acton
,
from
whence
they
threaded
a
devious
lane
to
Brentford
.
<EOS>
Here
they
encountered
several
fugitives
from
the
great
city
,
and
,
as
they
approached
Hounslow
,
learned
from
other
wayfarers
that
a
band
of
highwaymen
,
by
whom
the
heath
was
infested
,
had
become
more
than
usually
daring
since
the
outbreak
of
the
pestilence
,
and
claimed
a
heavy
tax
from
all
travellers
.
<EOS>
This
was
bad
news
to
Leonard
,
who
became
apprehensive
for
the
safety
of
the
bag
of
gold
given
to
Nizza
by
the
enthusiast
,
and
he
would
have
taken
another
road
if
it
had
been
practicable
;
but
as
there
was
no
alternative
except
to
proceed
,
he
put
all
the
money
he
had
about
him
into
a
leathern
purse
,
trusting
that
the
highwaymen
,
if
they
attacked
them
,
would
be
content
with
this
booty
.
 
<EOS>
When
about
halfway
across
the
vast
heath
,
which
spread
around
them
,
in
a
wild
but
not
unpicturesque
expanse
,
for
many
miles
on
either
side
,
Leonard
perceived
a
band
of
horsemen
,
amounting
perhaps
to
a
dozen
,
galloping
towards
them
,
and
,
not
doubting
they
were
the
robbers
in
question
,
communicated
his
suspicions
to
his
companions
.
<EOS>
Neither
Amabel
nor
Nizza
Macascree
appeared
much
alarmed
,
but
Blaize
was
so
terrified
that
he
could
scarcely
keep
his
seat
,
and
was
with
difficulty
prevented
from
turning
his
horse
's
head
and
riding
off
in
the
opposite
direction
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
highwaymen
had
come
up
.
<EOS>
With
loud
oaths
,
two
of
their
number
held
pistols
to
the
heads
of
Leonard
and
Blaize
,
and
demanded
their
money
.
<EOS>
The
apprentice
replied
by
drawing
forth
his
purse
,
and
besought
the
fellow
to
whom
he
gave
it
not
to
maltreat
his
companion
.
<EOS>
The
man
rejoined
with
a
savage
imprecation
that
he
"
would
maltreat
them
both
if
they
did
not
instantly
dismount
and
let
him
search
the
saddle
-
bags
;
"
and
he
was
proceeding
to
drag
Amabel
from
the
saddle
,
when
Leonard
struck
him
a
violent
blow
with
his
heavy
riding
-
whip
,
which
brought
him
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
He
was
up
again
,
however
,
in
an
instant
,
and
would
have
fired
his
pistol
at
the
apprentice
,
if
a
masked
individual
,
who
was
evidently
,
from
the
richness
of
his
attire
,
and
the
deference
paid
him
by
the
others
,
the
captain
of
the
band
,
had
not
interfered
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
rightly
served
,
Dick
Dosset
,
"
said
this
person
,
"
for
your
rudeness
to
a
lady
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
none
of
my
band
guilty
of
incivility
,
and
if
this
young
man
had
not
punished
you
,
I
would
have
done
so
myself
.
<EOS>
Pass
free
,
my
pretty
damsel
,
"
he
added
,
bowing
gallantly
to
Amabel
;
"
you
shall
not
be
further
molested
.
"
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Blaize
exhibited
the
contents
of
his
pockets
to
the
other
highwayman
,
who
having
opened
the
box
of
rufuses
and
smelt
at
the
phial
of
plague
-
water
,
returned
them
to
him
with
a
look
of
disgust
,
and
bade
him
follow
his
companions
.
<EOS>
As
Leonard
was
departing
,
the
captain
of
the
band
rode
after
him
,
and
inquired
whether
he
had
heard
at
what
hour
the
king
meant
to
leave
Whitehall
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
court
is
about
to
adjourn
to
Oxford
,
"
he
added
,
"
and
the
king
and
some
of
his
courtiers
will
cross
the
heath
to
-
day
,
when
I
purpose
to
levy
the
same
tax
from
his
majesty
that
I
do
from
his
subjects
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
replied
,
that
he
was
utterly
ignorant
of
the
king
's
movements
;
and
explaining
whence
he
came
,
the
captain
left
him
.
<EOS>
The
intelligence
he
had
thus
accidentally
obtained
was
far
from
satisfactory
to
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
For
some
distance
,
their
road
would
be
the
same
as
that
about
to
be
taken
by
the
monarch
and
his
attendants
,
amongst
whom
it
was
not
improbable
Rochester
might
be
numbered
;
and
the
possibility
that
the
earl
might
overtake
them
and
discover
Amabel
filled
him
with
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
Concealing
his
alarm
,
however
,
he
urged
his
steed
to
a
quicker
pace
,
and
proceeded
briskly
on
his
way
,
glad
,
at
least
,
that
he
had
not
lost
Solomon
Eagle
's
gift
to
Nizza
.
<EOS>
Amabel
's
weakly
condition
compelled
them
to
rest
at
frequent
intervals
,
and
it
was
not
until
evening
was
drawing
in
that
they
descended
the
steep
hill
leading
to
the
beautiful
village
of
Henley
-
upon
-
Thames
,
where
they
proposed
to
halt
for
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
Crossing
the
bridge
,
they
found
a
considerable
number
of
the
inhabitants
assembled
in
the
main
street
and
in
the
market
-
place
,
in
expectation
of
the
king
's
passing
through
the
town
on
his
way
to
Oxford
,
intimation
of
his
approach
having
been
conveyed
by
avant
-
couriers
.
<EOS>
Leonard
proceeded
to
the
principal
inn
,
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
procure
accommodation
.
<EOS>
Having
conducted
Amabel
and
Nizza
to
their
room
,
he
was
repairing
to
the
stable
with
Blaize
to
see
after
their
steeds
,
when
a
loud
blowing
of
horns
was
heard
on
the
bridge
,
succeeded
by
the
tramp
of
horses
and
the
rattling
of
wheels
,
and
the
next
moment
four
valets
in
splendid
livery
rode
up
,
followed
by
a
magnificent
coach
.
<EOS>
The
shouts
of
the
assemblage
proclaimed
that
it
was
the
king
.
<EOS>
The
cavalcade
stopped
before
the
inn
,
from
the
yard
of
which
six
fine
horses
were
brought
and
attached
to
the
royal
carriage
,
in
place
of
others
which
were
removed
.
<EOS>
Charles
was
laughing
heartily
,
and
desired
his
attendants
,
who
were
neither
numerous
nor
well
-
armed
,
to
take
care
they
were
not
robbed
again
between
this
place
and
Oxford
;
"
Though
,
"
added
the
monarch
,
"
it
is
now
of
little
consequence
,
since
we
have
nothing
to
lose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
your
majesty
can
have
been
robbed
?
"
asked
the
landlord
,
who
stood
cap
in
hand
at
the
door
of
the
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
"
I'faith
,
man
,
it
_
is
_
possible
,
"
rejoined
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
We
were
stopped
on
Hounslow
Heath
by
a
band
of
highwaymen
,
who
carried
off
two
large
coffers
filled
with
gold
,
and
would
have
eased
us
of
our
swords
and
snuff
-
boxes
but
for
the
interposition
of
their
captain
,
who
,
as
we
live
,
is
one
of
the
politest
men
breathing
--
is
he
not
,
Rochester
?
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
Holt
,
who
was
among
the
crowd
of
spectators
,
started
at
the
mention
of
this
name
,
and
he
trembled
as
the
earl
leaned
forward
in
answer
to
the
king
's
question
.
<EOS>
The
eyes
of
the
rivals
met
at
this
moment
,
for
both
were
within
a
few
yards
of
each
other
,
and
Rochester
,
whose
cheek
was
flushed
with
anger
,
solicited
the
king
's
permission
to
alight
,
but
Charles
,
affirming
it
was
getting
late
,
would
not
permit
him
,
and
as
the
horses
were
harnessed
,
and
the
drivers
mounted
,
he
ordered
them
to
proceed
without
delay
.
 
<EOS>
Inexpressibly
relieved
by
his
rival
's
departure
,
Leonard
returned
to
the
house
,
and
acquainted
Amabel
with
what
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
Quitting
Henley
betimes
on
the
following
morning
<EOS>
,
they
arrived
in
about
three
hours
at
Wallingford
,
where
they
halted
for
some
time
,
and
,
then
pursuing
their
journey
,
reached
Wantage
at
four
o'clock
,
where
they
tarried
for
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Up
to
this
hour
,
Leonard
had
doubted
the
possibility
of
reaching
their
destination
that
night
;
but
Amabel
assuring
him
<EOS>
she
felt
no
fatigue
,
he
determined
to
push
on
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
having
refreshed
their
steeds
,
they
set
forward
,
and
soon
began
to
mount
the
beautiful
downs
lying
on
the
west
of
this
ancient
town
.
 
<EOS>
Crossing
these
heights
,
whence
they
obtained
the
most
magnificent
and
extensive
views
of
the
surrounding
country
,
they
reached
in
about
three
-
quarters
of
an
hour
the
pretty
little
hamlet
of
Kingston
Lisle
.
<EOS>
Here
they
again
paused
at
a
small
inn
at
the
foot
of
a
lofty
hill
,
denominated
,
from
a
curious
relic
kept
there
,
the
Blowing
Stone
.
<EOS>
This
rocky
fragment
,
which
is
still
in
existence
,
is
perforated
by
a
number
of
holes
,
which
emit
,
if
blown
into
,
a
strange
bellowing
sound
.
<EOS>
Unaware
of
this
circumstance
,
Leonard
entered
the
house
with
the
others
,
and
had
just
seated
,
himself
,
when
they
were
,
astounded
by
a
strange
unearthly
roar
.
<EOS>
Rushing
forth
,
Leonard
found
Blaize
with
his
cheeks
puffed
out
and
his
mouth
applied
to
the
stone
,
into
which
he
was
blowing
with
all
his
force
,
and
producing
the
above
-
mentioned
extraordinary
noise
.
 
<EOS>
Shortly
after
this
,
the
party
quitted
the
Blowing
Stone
,
and
having
toiled
up
the
steep
sides
of
the
hill
,
they
were
amply
repaid
on
reaching
its
summit
by
one
of
the
finest
views
they
had
ever
beheld
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
hill
on
which
they
stood
commanded
the
whole
of
the
extensive
and
beautiful
vale
of
the
White
Horse
,
which
was
spread
out
before
them
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
,
like
a
vast
panorama
,
disclosing
a
thousand
fields
covered
with
abundant
,
though
as
yet
immature
crops
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
goodly
prospect
,
and
seemed
to
promise
plenty
and
prosperity
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
Almost
beneath
them
stood
the
reverend
church
of
Uffington
overtopping
the
ancient
village
clustering
round
it
.
<EOS>
Numerous
other
towers
and
spires
could
be
seen
peeping
out
of
groves
of
trees
,
which
,
together
with
the
scattered
mansions
and
farmhouses
surrounded
by
granges
and
stacks
of
hay
and
beans
,
gave
interest
and
diversity
to
the
prospect
.
<EOS>
The
two
most
prominent
objects
in
the
view
were
the
wooded
heights
of
Farringdon
on
the
one
hand
,
and
those
of
Abingdon
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Proceeding
along
the
old
Roman
road
,
still
distinctly
marked
out
,
and
running
along
the
ridge
of
this
beautiful
chain
of
hills
,
they
arrived
at
an
immense
Roman
encampment
,
vulgarly
called
Uffingham
Castle
,
occupying
the
crown
of
a
hill
.
<EOS>
A
shepherd
,
who
was
tending
a
flock
of
sheep
which
were
browsing
on
the
delicious
herbage
to
be
found
within
the
vast
circular
space
enclosed
by
the
inner
vallum
of
the
camp
,
explained
its
purpose
,
and
they
could
not
but
regard
it
with
interest
.
<EOS>
He
informed
them
that
they
were
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
famous
White
Horse
,
a
figure
cut
out
of
the
turf
on
the
hillside
by
the
Saxons
,
and
visible
for
many
miles
.
<EOS>
Conducting
them
to
a
point
whence
they
could
survey
this
curious
work
,
their
guide
next
directed
them
to
Ashdown
Lodge
,
which
lay
,
he
told
them
,
at
about
four
miles
'
distance
.
<EOS>
They
had
wandered
a
little
out
of
their
course
,
but
he
accompanied
them
for
a
mile
,
until
they
came
in
sight
of
a
thick
grove
of
trees
clothing
a
beautiful
valley
,
above
which
could
be
seen
the
lofty
cupola
of
the
mansion
.
 
<EOS>
Cheered
by
the
sight
,
and
invigorated
by
the
fresh
breeze
blowing
in
this
healthful
region
,
they
pressed
forward
,
and
soon
drew
near
the
mansion
,
which
they
found
was
approached
by
four
noble
avenues
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
advanced
far
,
when
a
stalwart
personage
,
six
feet
two
high
,
and
proportionately
stoutly
made
,
issued
from
the
covert
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
gun
over
his
shoulder
and
was
attended
by
a
couple
of
fine
dogs
.
<EOS>
Telling
them
he
was
called
John
Lutcombe
,
and
was
the
Earl
of
Craven
's
gamekeeper
,
he
inquired
their
business
,
and
,
on
being
informed
of
it
,
changed
his
surly
manner
to
one
of
great
cordiality
,
and
informed
them
that
Mrs.
Buscot
--
such
was
the
name
of
Amabel
's
aunt
--
was
at
home
,
and
would
be
heartily
glad
to
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
heard
her
speak
of
her
brother
,
Mr.
Bloundel
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
am
well
aware
that
he
is
an
excellent
man
.
<EOS>
Poor
soul
!
<EOS>
she
has
been
very
uneasy
about
him
and
his
family
during
this
awful
dispensation
,
though
she
had
received
a
letter
to
say
that
he
was
about
to
close
his
house
,
and
hoped
,
under
the
blessing
of
Providence
,
to
escape
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
His
daughter
will
be
welcome
,
and
she
can
not
come
to
a
healthier
spot
than
Ashdown
,
nor
to
a
better
nurse
than
Mrs.
Buscot
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
led
the
way
to
the
court
-
yard
,
and
,
entering
the
dwelling
,
presently
returned
with
a
middle
-
aged
woman
,
who
Amabel
instantly
knew
,
from
the
likeness
to
her
father
,
must
be
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Buscot
caught
her
in
her
arms
,
and
almost
smothered
her
with
kisses
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
first
transports
of
surprise
and
joy
had
subsided
,
the
good
housekeeper
took
her
niece
and
Nizza
Macascree
into
the
house
,
and
desired
John
Lutcombe
to
attend
to
the
others
.

ASHDOWN
LODGE
.
 
<EOS>
Erected
by
Inigo
Jones
,
and
still
continuing
in
precisely
the
same
state
as
at
the
period
of
this
history
,
Ashdown
Lodge
is
a
large
square
edifice
,
built
in
the
formal
French
taste
of
the
seventeenth
century
,
with
immense
casements
,
giving
it
the
appearance
of
being
all
glass
,
a
high
roof
lighted
by
dormer
windows
,
terminated
at
each
angle
by
a
tall
and
not
very
ornamental
chimney
,
and
surmounted
by
a
lofty
and
lantern
-
like
belvedere
,
crowned
in
its
turn
by
a
glass
cupola
.
<EOS>
The
belvedere
opens
upon
a
square
gallery
defended
by
a
broad
balustrade
,
and
overlooking
the
umbrageous
masses
and
lovely
hills
around
it
.
<EOS>
The
house
,
as
has
been
stated
,
is
approached
by
four
noble
avenues
,
the
timber
constituting
which
,
is
,
of
course
,
much
finer
now
than
at
the
period
under
consideration
,
and
possesses
a
delightful
old
-
fashioned
garden
,
and
stately
terrace
.
<EOS>
The
rooms
are
lofty
but
small
,
and
there
is
a
magnificent
staircase
,
occupying
nearly
half
the
interior
of
the
building
.
<EOS>
Among
other
portraits
decorating
the
walls
,
is
one
of
Elizabeth
Stuart
,
daughter
of
James
the
First
,
and
Queen
of
Bohemia
,
for
whom
the
first
Earl
of
Craven
entertained
so
romantic
an
attachment
,
and
to
whom
he
was
supposed
to
be
privately
united
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
be
more
secluded
than
the
situation
of
the
mansion
,
lying
as
it
does
in
the
midst
of
a
gentle
valley
,
surrounded
by
a
thick
wood
,
and
without
having
a
single
habitation
in
view
.
<EOS>
Its
chief
interest
,
however
,
must
always
be
derived
from
its
connection
with
the
memory
of
the
chivalrous
and
high
-
souled
nobleman
by
whom
it
was
erected
,
and
who
made
it
occasionally
his
retreat
after
the
death
of
his
presumed
royal
consort
,
which
occurred
about
four
years
previous
to
the
date
of
this
history
.
 
<EOS>
Amabel
was
delighted
with
her
new
abode
,
and
she
experienced
the
kindness
of
a
parent
from
her
aunt
,
with
whom
,
owing
to
circumstances
,
she
had
not
hitherto
been
personally
acquainted
,
having
only
seen
her
when
too
young
to
retain
any
recollection
of
the
event
.
<EOS>
The
widow
of
a
farmer
,
who
had
resided
on
Lord
Craven
's
estate
near
Kingston
Lisle
,
Mrs.
Buscot
,
after
her
husband
's
death
,
had
been
engaged
as
housekeeper
at
Ashdown
Lodge
,
and
had
filled
the
situation
for
many
years
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
her
employer
.
<EOS>
She
was
two
or
three
years
older
than
her
brother
,
Mr.
Bloundel
;
but
the
perfect
health
she
enjoyed
,
and
which
she
attributed
to
the
salubrious
air
of
the
downs
,
combined
with
her
natural
cheerfulness
of
disposition
,
made
her
look
much
the
younger
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
Her
features
,
besides
their
kindly
and
benevolent
expression
,
were
extremely
pleasing
,
and
must
,
some
years
ago
,
have
been
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Even
now
,
what
with
her
fresh
complexion
,
her
white
teeth
,
and
plump
figure
,
she
made
no
slight
pretensions
to
comeliness
.
<EOS>
She
possessed
the
same
good
sense
and
integrity
of
character
as
her
brother
,
together
with
his
strong
religious
feeling
,
but
entirely
unaccompanied
by
austerity
.
 
<EOS>
Having
no
children
,
she
was
able
to
bestow
her
entire
affections
upon
Amabel
,
whose
sad
story
,
when
she
became
acquainted
with
it
,
painfully
affected
her
;
nor
was
she
less
concerned
at
her
precarious
state
of
health
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
day
or
two
after
their
arrival
,
Amabel
suffered
greatly
from
the
effects
of
the
journey
;
but
after
that
time
,
she
gained
strength
so
rapidly
,
that
Mrs.
Buscot
,
who
at
first
had
well
-
nigh
despaired
of
her
recovery
,
began
to
indulge
a
hope
.
<EOS>
The
gentle
sufferer
would
sit
throughout
the
day
with
her
aunt
and
Nizza
Macascree
in
the
gallery
near
the
belvedere
,
inhaling
the
pure
breeze
blowing
from
the
surrounding
hills
,
and
stirring
the
tree
-
tops
beneath
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
expected
so
much
happiness
,
"
she
observed
,
on
one
occasion
,
to
Mrs.
Buscot
,
"
and
begin
to
experience
the
truth
of
Doctor
Hodges
'
assertion
,
that
with
returning
health
,
the
desire
of
life
would
return
.
<EOS>
I
now
wish
to
live
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
heartily
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Buscot
,
"
and
hold
it
a
certain
sign
of
your
speedy
restoration
to
health
.
<EOS>
Before
you
have
been
a
month
with
me
,
I
expect
to
bring
back
the
roses
to
those
pale
cheeks
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
too
sanguine
<EOS>
,
I
fear
,
dear
aunt
,
"
rejoined
Amabel
,
"
but
the
change
that
has
taken
place
in
my
feelings
,
may
operate
beneficially
upon
my
constitution
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
of
it
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Buscot
;
"
no
doubt
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
good
dame
felt
a
strong
inclination
at
this
moment
to
introduce
a
subject
very
near
her
heart
,
but
,
feeling
doubtful
as
to
its
reception
,
she
checked
herself
.
<EOS>
The
devoted
attachment
of
the
apprentice
to
her
niece
had
entirely
won
her
regard
,
and
she
fondly
hoped
she
would
be
able
to
wean
Amabel
from
all
thought
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
and
induce
her
to
give
her
hand
to
her
faithful
lover
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
she
often
spoke
to
her
of
Leonard
--
of
his
devotion
and
constancy
,
his
good
looks
and
excellent
qualities
;
and
though
Amabel
assented
to
all
she
said
,
Mrs.
Buscot
was
sorry
to
perceive
that
the
impression
she
desired
was
not
produced
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
so
with
Nizza
Macascree
.
<EOS>
Whenever
Leonard
's
name
was
mentioned
,
her
eyes
sparkled
,
her
cheek
glowed
,
and
she
responded
so
warmly
to
all
that
was
said
in
his
praise
,
that
Mrs.
Buscot
soon
found
out
the
state
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
The
discovery
occasioned
her
some
little
disquietude
,
for
the
worthy
creature
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
making
even
her
niece
happy
at
the
expense
of
another
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
object
of
all
this
tender
interest
,
he
felt
far
happier
than
he
had
done
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
He
saw
Amabel
every
day
,
and
noted
with
unspeakable
delight
the
gradual
improvement
which
appeared
to
be
taking
place
in
her
health
.
<EOS>
The
greater
part
of
his
time
,
however
,
was
not
passed
in
her
society
,
but
in
threading
the
intricacies
of
the
wood
,
or
in
rambling
over
the
neighbouring
downs
;
and
he
not
only
derived
pleasure
from
these
rambles
,
but
his
health
and
spirits
,
which
had
been
not
a
little
shaken
by
the
awful
scenes
he
had
recently
witnessed
,
were
materially
improved
.
<EOS>
Here
,
at
last
,
he
seemed
to
have
got
rid
of
the
grim
spectre
which
,
for
two
months
,
had
constantly
haunted
him
.
<EOS>
No
greater
contrast
can
be
conceived
than
his
present
quiet
life
offered
to
the
fearful
excitement
he
had
recently
undergone
.
<EOS>
For
hot
and
narrow
thoroughfares
reeking
with
pestilential
effluvia
,
resounding
with
frightful
shrieks
,
or
piteous
cries
,
and
bearing
on
every
side
marks
of
the
destructive
progress
of
the
scourge
--
for
these
terrible
sights
and
sounds
--
for
the
charnel
horrors
of
the
plague
-
pit
--
the
scarcely
less
revolting
scenes
at
the
pest
-
house
--
<EOS>
the
dismal
bell
announcing
the
dead
-
cart
--
the
doleful
cries
of
the
buriers
--
for
graves
surfeited
with
corruption
,
and
streets
filled
with
the
dying
and
the
dead
--
and
,
above
all
,
for
the
ever
-
haunting
expectation
that
a
like
fate
might
be
his
own,--he
had
exchanged
green
hills
,
fresh
breezes
,
spreading
views
,
the
song
of
the
lark
,
and
a
thousand
other
delights
,
and
assurances
of
health
and
contentment
.
<EOS>
Often
,
as
he
gazed
from
the
ridge
of
the
downs
into
the
wide
-
spread
vale
beneath
,
he
wondered
whether
the
destroying
angel
had
smitten
any
of
its
peaceful
habitations
,
and
breathed
a
prayer
for
their
preservation
!
 
<EOS>
But
the
satisfaction
he
derived
from
having
quitted
the
infected
city
was
trifling
compared
with
that
of
Blaize
,
whose
sole
anxiety
was
lest
he
should
be
sent
back
to
London
.
<EOS>
Seldom
straying
further
than
the
gates
of
the
mansion
,
though
often
invited
by
John
Lutcombe
to
accompany
him
to
some
of
the
neighbouring
villages
;
having
little
to
do
,
and
less
to
think
of
,
unless
to
calculate
how
much
he
could
consume
at
the
next
<EOS>
meal,--for
he
had
banished
all
idea
of
the
plague,--he
conceived
himself
at
the
summit
of
happiness
,
and
waxed
so
sleek
and
round
,
that
his
face
shone
like
a
full
moon
,
while
his
doublet
would
scarcely
meet
around
his
waist
.
 
<EOS>
One
day
,
about
a
fortnight
after
their
arrival
,
and
when
things
were
in
this
happy
state
,
Amabel
,
who
was
seated
as
usual
in
the
gallery
at
the
summit
of
the
house
,
observed
a
troop
of
horsemen
,
very
gallantly
equipped
,
appear
at
the
further
end
of
the
northern
avenue
.
<EOS>
An
inexpressible
terror
seized
her
,
and
she
would
have
fled
into
the
house
,
but
her
limbs
refused
their
office
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
there
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
to
Nizza
,
who
,
at
that
moment
,
presented
herself
at
the
glass
door
.
"
<EOS>
Look
there
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
pointing
to
the
cavalcade
;
"
what
I
dreaded
has
come
to
pass
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Rochester
has
found
me
out
,
and
is
coming
hither
to
carry
me
off
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
die
rather
than
accompany
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
mistaken
,
"
replied
Nizza
,
expressing
a
hopefulness
,
which
her
looks
belied
;
"
it
may
be
the
Earl
of
Craven
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
give
me
new
life
,
"
rejoined
Amabel
;
"
but
no
--
no
--
my
aunt
has
told
me
that
the
good
earl
will
not
quit
the
city
during
the
continuance
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
And
see
!
<EOS>
some
of
the
horsemen
have
distinguished
us
,
and
are
waving
their
hats
.
<EOS>
My
heart
tells
me
the
Earl
of
Rochester
is
amongst
them
.
<EOS>
Give
me
your
arm
,
Nizza
,
and
I
will
try
to
gain
some
place
of
concealment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
let
us
fly
,
"
replied
the
other
,
assisting
her
towards
the
door
;
"
I
am
in
equal
danger
with
yourself
,
for
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
is
doubtless
with
them
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
where
--
where
is
Leonard
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
below
,
"
cried
Amabel
"
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
aid
us
at
this
juncture
;
we
must
depend
upon
ourselves
.
"
 
<EOS>
Descending
a
short
staircase
,
they
entered
Amabel
's
chamber
,
and
fastening
the
door
,
awaited
with
breathless
anxiety
the
arrival
of
the
horsemen
.
<EOS>
Though
the
room
whither
they
had
retreated
was
in
the
upper
part
of
the
house
,
they
could
distinctly
hear
what
was
going
on
below
,
and
shortly
afterwards
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
stairs
,
blended
with
merry
voices
and
loud
laughter
--
<EOS>
amid
which
,
Amabel
could
distinguish
the
tones
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
--
reached
them
.
 
<EOS>
While
both
were
palpitating
with
fright
,
the
handle
of
the
door
was
tried
,
and
a
voice
announced
that
the
apprentice
was
without
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
is
lost
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
speaking
through
the
keyhole
;
"
the
king
is
here
,
and
is
accompanied
by
the
Earl
of
Rochester
and
other
profligates
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
king
!
"
exclaimed
Amabel
,
joyfully
;
"
then
I
am
no
longer
apprehensive
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
yet
,
no
inquiries
have
been
made
after
you
,
"
continued
Leonard
,
unconscious
of
the
effect
produced
by
his
intelligence
,
"
but
it
is
evident
<EOS>
they
know
you
are
here
.
<EOS>
Be
prepared
,
therefore
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
am
_
prepared
,
"
rejoined
Amabel
.
<EOS>
And
as
she
spoke
,
she
threw
open
the
door
and
admitted
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
stay
with
us
,
"
she
added
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
In
case
of
need
,
I
will
throw
myself
on
his
majesty
's
protection
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
avail
you
little
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
,
distrustfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
so
,
"
said
Amabel
,
confidently
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
faith
in
his
acknowledged
kindness
of
heart
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
are
right
,
"
returned
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Buscot
is
at
present
with
his
majesty
in
the
receiving
-
room
.
<EOS>
Will
you
not
make
fast
your
door
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Amabel
,
firmly
;
"
if
the
king
will
not
defend
me
,
I
will
defend
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
glanced
at
her
with
admiration
,
but
he
said
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
here
?
"
asked
Nizza
Macascree
,
with
great
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
seen
him
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
"
and
I
have
carefully
examined
the
countenances
of
all
the
king
's
attendants
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
be
praised
!
"
exclaimed
Nizza
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
Mrs.
Buscot
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
Her
looks
bespoke
great
agitation
,
and
she
trembled
violently
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
doubt
heard
from
Leonard
that
the
king
and
his
courtiers
are
below
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
His
majesty
inquired
whether
you
were
here
,
and
I
did
not
dare
to
deceive
him
.
<EOS>
He
desires
to
see
you
,
and
has
sent
me
for
you
.
<EOS>
What
is
to
be
done
?
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
with
a
look
of
distraction
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
must
obey
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
alternative
,
"
replied
Amabel
;
"
I
will
obey
his
majesty
's
commands
as
soon
as
I
can
collect
myself
.
<EOS>
Take
back
that
answer
,
dear
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Has
Leonard
told
you
that
the
Earl
of
Rochester
is
here
?
"
pursued
Mrs.
Buscot
.
 
<EOS>
Amabel
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
"
God
grant
that
good
may
come
of
it
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Buscot
,
clasping
her
hands
together
,
as
she
quitted
the
room
;
"
but
I
am
sorely
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
A
half
-
suppressed
groan
from
the
apprentice
told
that
he
shared
in
her
apprehensions
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
us
,
Leonard
,
"
said
Amabel
;
"
I
would
prepare
myself
for
the
interview
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
apprentice
obeyed
,
and
closing
the
door
after
him
,
stationed
himself
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
.
<EOS>
Left
alone
with
Nizza
,
Amabel
threw
herself
on
her
knees
,
and
besought
the
support
of
Heaven
on
this
trying
occasion
.
<EOS>
She
then
arose
,
and
giving
her
hand
to
Nizza
,
they
went
down
stairs
together
.
<EOS>
Leonard
followed
them
at
a
little
distance
,
and
with
a
beating
heart
.
<EOS>
Two
gentlemen
-
ushers
were
posted
,
at
the
door
of
the
chamber
occupied
by
the
king
.
<EOS>
Not
far
from
them
stood
Mrs.
Buscot
,
who
,
having
made
known
her
niece
to
the
officials
,
they
instantly
admitted
her
,
but
ordered
Nizza
to
remain
outside
.
 
<EOS>
On
entering
the
room
,
Amabel
at
once
discovered
the
king
.
<EOS>
He
was
habited
in
a
magnificent
riding
-
dress
and
was
seated
on
a
rich
fauteuil
,
around
which
were
grouped
a
dozen
gaily
-
attired
courtiers
.
<EOS>
Amongst
these
were
the
Earl
of
Rochester
and
Sir
George
Etherege
.
<EOS>
As
Amabel
advanced
,
glances
of
insolent
curiosity
were
directed
towards
her
,
and
Rochester
,
stepping
forward
,
offered
to
lead
her
to
the
king
.
<EOS>
She
,
however
,
declined
the
attention
.
<EOS>
Greatly
mortified
,
the
earl
would
have
seized
her
hand
;
but
there
was
so
much
dignity
in
her
deportment
,
so
much
coldness
in
her
looks
,
that
in
spite
of
his
effrontery
,
he
felt
abashed
.
<EOS>
Charles
smiled
at
his
favourite
's
rebuff
,
but
,
in
common
with
the
others
,
he
could
not
help
being
struck
by
Amabel
's
extraordinary
beauty
and
natural
dignity
,
and
he
observed
,
in
an
under
-
tone
,
to
Etherege
,
"
Is
it
possible
this
can
be
a
grocer
's
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
passes
for
such
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Etherege
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
can
not
swear
to
her
parentage
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Since
I
have
seen
her
,
I
do
not
wonder
at
Rochester
's
extravagant
passion
,
"
rejoined
the
monarch
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
odds
fish
!
<EOS>
she
seems
to
care
little
for
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
Having
approached
within
a
short
distance
of
the
king
,
Amabel
would
have
prostrated
herself
before
him
,
but
he
prevented
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
do
not
kneel
,
sweetheart
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
am
fully
satisfied
of
your
loyalty
,
and
never
exact
homage
from
one
of
your
sex
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
am
ever
ready
to
pay
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
much
of
your
attractions
,
and
,
what
is
seldom
the
case
in
such
matters
,
find
they
have
not
been
overrated
.
<EOS>
The
brightest
of
our
court
beauties
can
not
compare
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
moment
ago
,
the
fair
Amabel
might
be
said
to
lack
bloom
,
"
observed
Etherege
;
"
but
your
majesty
's
praises
have
called
a
glowing
colour
to
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Would
you
deign
to
grant
me
a
moment
's
hearing
,
my
liege
?
"
said
Amabel
,
looking
steadfastly
at
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
moment
's
hearing
merely
,
sweetheart
,
"
returned
Charles
;
"
but
an
hour
's
,
if
you
list
.
<EOS>
I
could
dwell
on
the
music
of
your
tones
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thank
your
majesty
for
your
condescension
,
"
she
replied
;
"
but
<EOS>
I
will
not
long
trespass
on
your
patience
.
<EOS>
What
I
have
to
say
concerns
the
Earl
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Stand
forward
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Charles
to
the
earl
,
"
and
let
us
hear
what
complaint
is
to
be
made
against
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Rochester
advanced
,
and
threw
a
passionate
and
half
-
reproachful
glance
at
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
improper
for
me
to
trouble
your
majesty
on
so
light
a
matter
,
"
said
Amabel
;
"
but
your
kindness
emboldens
me
to
speak
unreservedly
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
aware
that
this
nobleman
once
entertained
,
or
feigned
to
entertain
,
an
ardent
attachment
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
need
scarcely
assure
you
,
my
liege
,
"
interposed
Rochester
,
"
that
it
was
no
feigned
passion
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
needless
to
add
,
that
however
ardently
I
felt
towards
my
fair
accuser
then
,
my
passion
has
in
nowise
abated
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
wonder
if
it
had
,
"
rejoined
Charles
,
gallantly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
contradict
you
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Amabel
;
"
it
_
is
<EOS>
_
possible
<EOS>
you
may
have
loved
me
,
though
I
find
it
difficult
to
reconcile
your
professions
of
regard
with
your
conduct
--
but
this
is
not
to
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
Whether
you
loved
me
or
not
,
I
loved
_
you_--deeply
and
devotedly
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
sacrifice
I
would
not
have
made
for
him
,
"
she
continued
,
turning
to
the
king
,
"
and
influenced
by
these
feelings
,
and
deluded
by
false
promises
,
I
forgot
my
duty
,
and
was
rash
enough
to
quit
my
home
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
All
this
I
have
heard
,
sweetheart
,
"
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
very
remarkable
in
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
ordinary
course
of
such
affairs
.
<EOS>
I
am
happy
to
be
the
means
of
restoring
your
lover
to
you
,
and
,
in
fact
,
came
hither
for
that
very
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
mistake
me
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
desire
to
have
him
restored
to
me
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
for
myself
,
I
have
succeeded
in
mastering
my
love
for
him
.
<EOS>
The
struggle
has
well
-
nigh
cost
me
my
life
--
<EOS>
but
I
_
have
_
conquered
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
yet
to
learn
,
sweetheart
,
"
observed
Charles
,
with
an
incredulous
look
,
"
that
woman
's
love
,
if
deeply
fixed
,
_
can
_
be
subdued
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
not
been
supported
by
religion
,
my
liege
,
I
could
_
not
_
have
subdued
it
,
"
rejoined
Amabel
"
Night
and
day
,
I
have
passed
in
supplicating
the
Great
Power
that
implanted
this
fatal
passion
in
my
breast
,
and
,
at
length
,
my
prayers
have
prevailed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
<EOS>
we
have
a
devotee
here
!
"
thought
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Am
I
to
understand
,
fair
saint
,
that
you
would
reject
the
earl
,
if
he
were
to
offer
you
his
hand
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Unquestionably
,
"
replied
Amabel
,
firmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
strange
,
"
muttered
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
The
girl
is
evidently
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
What
says
your
lordship
?
<EOS>
"
he
added
to
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
she
shall
be
mine
,
whether
she
loves
me
or
not
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
My
pride
is
piqued
to
the
conquest
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
wonder!--the
resistless
Rochester
flouted
by
a
grocer
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
ha
!
"
observed
Charles
,
laughing
,
while
the
rest
of
the
courtiers
joined
in
his
merriment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
sire
,
"
exclaimed
Amabel
,
throwing
herself
at
the
king
's
feet
,
and
bursting
into
tears
,
"
do
not
abandon
me
,
I
beseech
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
requite
the
earl
's
attachment
--
and
shall
die
if
he
continues
his
pursuit
.
<EOS>
Command
him
--
<EOS>
oh
!
command
him
to
desist
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
you
have
not
dealt
fairly
with
me
,
sweetheart
,
"
said
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
well
-
favoured
youth
without
,
whom
the
earl
pointed
out
as
your
father
's
apprentice
.
<EOS>
Have
you
transferred
your
affections
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
majesty
has
solved
the
enigma
,
"
observed
Rochester
,
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
wrong
me
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Leonard
Holt
is
without
.
<EOS>
Let
him
be
brought
into
the
royal
presence
and
interrogated
;
and
if
he
will
affirm
that
I
have
given
him
the
slightest
encouragement
by
look
or
word
,
or
even
state
that
he
himself
indulges
a
hope
of
holding
a
place
in
my
regards
,
I
will
admit
there
is
some
foundation
for
the
charge
.
<EOS>
I
pray
your
majesty
to
send
for
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
needless
,
"
replied
Charles
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
doubt
your
assertion
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
do
the
earl
an
injustice
as
well
as
yourself
,
if
you
do
not
allow
him
a
fair
hearing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
allow
me
five
minutes
alone
with
you
,
Amabel
,
or
will
take
a
single
turn
with
me
on
the
terrace
,
I
will
engage
to
remove
every
doubt
,
"
insinuated
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
fail
to
do
so
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
time
is
gone
by
when
those
accents
,
once
so
winning
in
my
ear
,
can
move
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
least
give
me
the
opportunity
,
"
implored
the
earl
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Amabel
,
decidedly
,
"
I
will
never
willingly
meet
you
more
;
for
though
I
am
firm
in
my
purpose
,
I
do
not
think
it
right
to
expose
myself
to
temptation
.
<EOS>
And
now
that
I
have
put
your
majesty
in
full
possession
of
my
sentiments
,
"
she
added
to
the
king
;
"
now
that
I
have
told
you
with
what
bitter
tears
<EOS>
I
have
striven
to
wash
out
my
error,--I
<EOS>
implore
you
to
extend
your
protecting
hand
towards
me
,
and
to
save
me
from
further
persecution
on
the
part
of
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
remain
at
this
place
to
-
night
,
"
returned
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
Take
till
to
-
morrow
to
consider
of
it
,
and
if
you
continue
in
the
same
mind
,
your
request
shall
be
granted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
enjoin
the
earl
to
leave
me
unmolested
till
then
,
"
cried
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hum
!
"
exclaimed
the
king
,
exchanging
a
look
with
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
pity
,
sire
,
do
not
hesitate
,
"
cried
Amabel
,
in
a
tone
of
such
agony
that
the
good
-
natured
monarch
could
not
resist
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
he
rejoined
;
"
it
shall
be
as
you
desire
.
<EOS>
Rochester
,
you
have
heard
our
promise
,
and
will
act
in
conformity
with
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
earl
bowed
carelessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
,
my
lord
,
"
pursued
Charles
,
authoritatively
,
"
<EOS>
my
commands
_
shall
_
be
obeyed
,
and
if
you
purpose
otherwise
,
I
will
place
you
under
restraint
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
majesty
's
wishes
are
sufficient
restraint
,
"
rejoined
Rochester
;
"
I
am
all
obedience
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
well
,
"
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
satisfied
,
fair
damsel
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
"
replied
Amabel
.
<EOS>
And
making
a
profound
and
grateful
reverence
to
the
king
,
she
retired
.
 
<EOS>
Nizza
Macascree
met
her
at
the
door
,
and
it
was
fortunate
<EOS>
she
did
so
,
or
Amabel
,
whose
strength
began
to
fail
her
,
would
otherwise
have
fallen
.
<EOS>
While
she
was
thus
engaged
,
Charles
caught
sight
of
the
piper
's
daughter
,
and
being
greatly
struck
by
her
beauty
,
inquired
her
name
.
 
<EOS>
"
Odds
fish
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
when
informed
of
it
by
Rochester
,
"
a
piper
's
daughter
!
<EOS>
She
is
far
more
beautiful
than
your
mistress
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
procure
her
for
your
majesty
,
will
you
withdraw
your
interdiction
from
me
?
"
rejoined
the
earl
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
--
no
--
that
is
impossible
,
after
the
pledge
I
have
given
,
"
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
bring
this
lovely
creature
to
me
anon
.
<EOS>
I
am
enchanted
with
her
,
and
do
not
regret
this
long
ride
,
since
it
has
brought
her
under
my
notice
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
majesty
's
wishes
shall
be
obeyed
,
"
said
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
wait
till
to
-
morrow
for
an
interview
with
Amabel
,
"
he
added
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Supported
by
Nizza
Macascree
and
her
aunt
,
and
followed
by
Leonard
,
Amabel
contrived
to
reach
her
own
chamber
,
and
as
soon
as
she
was
sufficiently
recovered
from
the
agitation
she
had
experienced
,
detailed
to
them
all
that
had
passed
in
her
interview
with
the
king
.
<EOS>
While
the
party
were
consulting
together
as
to
the
course
to
be
pursued
in
this
emergency
,
the
tap
of
a
wand
was
heard
at
the
door
,
and
the
summons
being
answered
by
Mrs.
Buscot
,
she
found
one
of
the
ushers
without
,
who
informed
her
it
was
the
king
's
pleasure
that
no
one
should
leave
the
house
till
the
following
day
,
without
his
permission
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
insure
obedience
to
his
orders
,
"
continued
the
usher
,
"
his
majesty
requires
that
the
keys
of
the
stables
be
delivered
to
the
keeping
of
his
chief
page
,
Mr.
Chiffinch
,
who
has
orders
,
together
with
myself
,
to
keep
watch
during
the
night
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
bowed
and
retired
,
while
Mrs.
Buscot
returned
with
this
new
and
alarming
piece
of
intelligence
to
the
others
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
should
the
mandate
be
respected
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Leonard
,
indignantly
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
committed
no
crime
,
and
ought
not
to
be
detained
prisoners
.
<EOS>
Trust
to
me
,
and
I
will
find
some
means
of
eluding
their
vigilance
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
remain
here
to
-
morrow
,
"
he
added
to
Amabel
,
"
you
are
lost
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
not
expect
any
rational
advice
from
me
,
my
dear
niece
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Buscot
,
"
for
I
am
fairly
bewildered
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
not
forfeit
the
king
's
protection
by
disobeying
his
injunctions
?
"
replied
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
safer
here
than
if
I
were
to
seek
a
new
asylum
,
which
would
be
speedily
discovered
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
grant
<EOS>
you
may
not
have
cause
to
repent
your
decision
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Leonard
,
despondingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
now
,
perforce
,
quit
you
,
my
dear
niece
,
"
said
Mrs.
Buscot
,
"
though
it
breaks
my
heart
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
His
majesty
's
arrival
has
thrown
everything
into
confusion
,
and
if
I
do
not
look
after
the
supper
,
which
is
commanded
at
an
early
hour
,
it
will
never
be
ready
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
there
will
be
nothing
fit
to
set
before
him
.
<EOS>
What
with
my
distress
about
you
,
and
my
anxiety
about
the
royal
repast
,
I
am
well
-
nigh
beside
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
she
quitted
the
room
,
and
Amabel
signifying
to
Leonard
that
she
desired
to
be
left
alone
with
Nizza
Macascree
<EOS>
,
he
departed
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
As
Mrs.
Buscot
had
stated
,
the
utmost
confusion
prevailed
below
.
<EOS>
The
royal
purveyor
and
cook
,
who
formed
part
of
the
king
's
suite
,
were
busily
employed
in
the
kitchen
,
and
though
they
had
the
whole
household
at
their
command
,
they
made
rather
slow
progress
at
first
,
owing
to
the
want
of
materials
.
<EOS>
In
a
short
time
,
however
,
this
difficulty
was
remedied
.
<EOS>
Ducks
were
slaughtered
by
the
dozen
;
fowls
by
the
score
,
and
a
couple
of
fat
geese
shared
the
same
fate
.
<EOS>
The
store
ponds
were
visited
for
fish
by
John
Lutcombe
;
and
as
the
country
abounded
with
game
,
a
large
supply
of
pheasants
,
partridges
,
and
rabbits
was
speedily
procured
by
the
keeper
and
his
assistants
.
<EOS>
Amongst
others
,
Blaize
lent
a
helping
-
hand
in
this
devastation
of
the
poultry
-
yard
,
and
he
had
just
returned
to
the
kitchen
,
and
commenced
plucking
one
of
the
geese
,
when
he
was
aroused
by
a
slap
on
the
shoulder
,
and
looking
up
,
beheld
Pillichody
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
ho
!
<EOS>
my
little
Blaize
,
my
physic
-
taking
porter
,
"
cried
the
bully
;
"
how
wags
the
world
with
you
?
<EOS>
And
how
is
my
pretty
Patience
?
<EOS>
How
is
that
peerless
kitchen
-
maiden
?
<EOS>
By
the
god
of
love
!
<EOS>
I
am
dying
to
behold
her
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Patience
is
well
enough
,
for
aught
I
know
,
"
replied
Blaize
,
in
a
surly
tone
.
"
<EOS>
But
it
is
useless
for
you
to
think
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
betrothed
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
replied
Pillichody
;
"
but
do
not
suppose
you
are
the
sole
master
of
her
affections
.
<EOS>
The
little
charmer
has
too
good
taste
for
that
.
'
<EOS>
Blaize
,
'
said
she
to
me
,
'
will
do
very
well
for
a
husband
,
but
he
can
not
expect
me
to
continue
faithful
to
him
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
not
I
?
"
exclaimed
the
porter
reddening
.
<EOS>
"
Fiends
take
her
!
<EOS>
but
I
do
!
<EOS>
When
did
she
say
this
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
When
I
last
visited
your
master
's
house
,
"
replied
Pillichody
.
"
<EOS>
Sweet
soul
!
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
her
tender
looks
,
nor
the
kisses
she
allowed
me
to
snatch
from
her
honeyed
lips
when
your
back
was
turned
.
<EOS>
The
very
recollection
of
them
is
enchanting
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Zounds
and
fury
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Blaize
,
transported
with
rage
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
only
a
porter
,
while
you
pretend
to
be
a
major
,
I
will
let
you
see
I
am
the
better
man
of
the
two
.
"
<EOS>
And
taking
the
goose
by
the
neck
,
he
swung
it
round
his
head
like
a
flail
,
and
began
to
batter
Pillichody
about
the
face
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
S'death
!
"
cried
the
bully
,
endeavouring
to
draw
his
sword
,
"
if
you
do
not
instantly
desist
,
I
will
treat
you
like
that
accursed
bird
--
cut
your
throat
,
pluck
,
stuff
,
roast
,
and
eat
you
afterwards
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
,
however
,
so
confounded
by
the
attack
,
that
he
could
offer
no
resistance
,
and
in
retreating
,
caught
his
foot
against
the
leg
of
a
table
,
and
fell
backwards
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Being
now
completely
at
the
porter
's
mercy
,
and
seeing
that
the
latter
was
preparing
to
pursue
his
advantage
with
a
rolling
-
pin
which
he
had
snatched
from
the
dresser
,
he
besought
him
piteously
to
spare
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Recant
all
you
have
said
,
"
cried
Blaize
,
brandishing
the
rolling
-
pin
over
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Confess
that
you
have
calumniated
Patience
.
<EOS>
Confess
that
she
rejected
your
advances
,
if
you
ever
dared
to
make
any
to
her
.
<EOS>
Confess
that
she
is
a
model
of
purity
and
constancy
.
<EOS>
Confess
all
this
,
villain
,
or
I
will
break
every
bone
in
your
body
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
confess
it
,
"
replied
Pillichody
,
abjectly
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
all
you
describe
.
<EOS>
She
never
allowed
me
greater
freedom
than
a
squeeze
of
the
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
was
too
much
,
"
replied
the
porter
,
belabouring
him
with
the
rolling
-
pin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Swear
that
you
will
never
attempt
such
a
liberty
again
,
or
I
will
pummel
you
to
death
.
<EOS>
Swear
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
swear
,
"
replied
Pillichody
.
 
<EOS>
"
Before
I
allow
you
to
rise
,
I
must
disarm
you
to
prevent
mischief
,
"
cried
Blaize
.
<EOS>
And
kneeling
down
upon
the
prostrate
bully
,
who
groaned
aloud
,
he
drew
his
long
blade
from
his
side
.
<EOS>
"
There
,
now
you
may
get
up
,
"
he
added
.
 
<EOS>
So
elated
was
Blaize
with
his
conquest
,
that
he
could
do
nothing
for
some
time
but
strut
up
and
down
the
kitchen
with
the
sword
over
his
shoulder
,
to
the
infinite
diversion
of
the
other
domestics
,
and
especially
of
John
Lutcombe
,
who
chanced
to
make
his
appearance
at
the
time
,
laden
with
a
fresh
supply
of
game
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Blaize
,
man
,
"
cried
the
keeper
,
approvingly
,
"
I
did
not
give
you
credit
for
half
so
much
spirit
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
man
's
courage
is
duly
appreciated
until
it
has
been
tried
,
"
rejoined
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
combat
with
you
,
gigantic
John
,
if
Patience
's
fidelity
were
called
in
question
.
"
 
<EOS>
Pillichody
,
meanwhile
,
had
retired
with
a
discomfited
air
into
a
corner
,
where
he
seated
himself
on
a
stool
,
and
eyed
the
porter
askance
,
as
if
meditating
some
terrible
retaliation
.
<EOS>
Secretly
apprehensive
of
this
,
and
thinking
it
becoming
to
act
with
generosity
towards
his
foe
,
Blaize
marched
up
to
him
,
and
extended
his
hand
in
token
of
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
To
the
surprise
of
all
,
Pillichody
did
not
reject
his
overtures
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
great
regard
for
you
,
friend
Blaize
,
"
he
said
,
"
otherwise
I
should
never
rest
till
I
had
been
repaid
with
terrible
interest
for
the
indignities
I
have
endured
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
heed
them
not
,
"
replied
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
make
allowances
for
the
jealous
feelings
you
excited
.
<EOS>
I
love
Patience
better
than
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Since
you
put
it
in
that
light
,
"
rejoined
Pillichody
,
"
I
am
willing
to
overlook
the
offence
.
<EOS>
Snakes
and
scorpions
!
<EOS>
no
man
can
be
a
greater
martyr
to
jealousy
than
myself
.
<EOS>
I
killed
three
of
my
most
intimate
friends
for
merely
presuming
to
ogle
the
widow
of
Watling
-
street
,
who
would
have
been
mine
,
if
she
had
not
died
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
of
the
plague
,
I
beseech
you
,
"
replied
Blaize
,
with
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
subject
never
mentioned
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
I
alluded
to
it
,
then
,
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Give
me
back
my
sword
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
fear
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
entirely
forgive
you
,
and
am
willing
to
drown
the
remembrance
of
our
quarrel
in
a
bottle
of
sack
.
"
 
<EOS>
Readily
assenting
to
the
proposition
,
Blaize
obtained
the
key
of
the
cellar
from
the
butler
,
and
adjourning
thither
with
Pillichody
,
they
seated
themselves
on
a
cask
with
a
bottle
of
sack
and
a
couple
of
large
glasses
on
a
stool
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
know
why
I
am
come
hither
?
"
observed
the
major
,
smacking
his
lips
after
his
second
bumper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
precisely
,
"
replied
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
presume
your
visit
has
some
reference
to
Mistress
Amabel
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
shrewd
guess
,
"
rejoined
Pillichody
.
"
<EOS>
And
this
reminds
me
that
we
have
omitted
to
drink
her
health
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Her
better
health
,
"
returned
Blaize
,
emptying
his
glass
.
<EOS>
"
Heaven
be
praised
!
<EOS>
she
has
plucked
up
a
little
since
we
came
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
would
soon
be
herself
again
if
she
were
united
to
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
"
said
Pillichody
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
you
are
wrong
,
"
replied
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
declares
she
has
no
longer
any
regard
for
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mere
caprice
,
believe
me
,
"
rejoined
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
loves
him
better
than
ever
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
,
"
returned
Blaize
;
"
for
Patience
,
who
ought
to
know
something
of
the
matter
,
assured
me
she
was
dying
for
the
earl
;
and
if
she
had
not
told
me
the
contrary
herself
,
I
should
not
have
believed
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
she
tell
you
so
in
the
presence
of
Leonard
?
"
asked
Pillichody
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
now
I
bethink
me
,
he
_
was
_
present
,
"
replied
Blaize
,
involuntarily
putting
his
hand
to
his
shoulder
,
as
he
recalled
the
horsewhipping
he
had
received
on
that
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
afraid
to
confess
her
attachment
to
the
earl
.
<EOS>
Is
Leonard
as
much
devoted
to
her
as
ever
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
so
,
"
replied
Blaize
,
"
but
she
certainly
gives
_
him
_
no
encouragement
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Confirmation
!
"
exclaimed
Pillichody
.
"
<EOS>
But
fill
your
glass
.
<EOS>
We
will
drink
to
the
earl
's
speedy
union
with
Amabel
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
loud
,
"
cried
Blaize
,
looking
uneasily
round
the
cellar
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
like
Leonard
to
overhear
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Neither
should
I
,
"
returned
Pillichody
,
"
for
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
respecting
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
propose
any
more
plans
for
carrying
off
Amabel
,
"
cried
Blaize
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
wo
n't
take
any
part
in
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
such
intention
,
"
rejoined
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
"
he
added
,
mysteriously
,
"
I
am
inclined
to
side
with
you
and
Leonard
.
<EOS>
But
as
we
have
finished
our
bottle
,
suppose
we
take
a
turn
in
the
court
-
yard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
With
all
my
heart
,
"
replied
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
Immediately
after
Amabel
's
departure
Charles
proceeded
with
his
courtiers
to
the
garden
,
and
continued
to
saunter
up
and
down
the
terrace
for
some
time
,
during
which
he
engaged
Rochester
in
conversation
,
so
as
to
give
him
no
pretext
for
absenting
himself
.
<EOS>
The
king
next
ascended
to
the
belvedere
,
and
having
surveyed
the
prospect
from
it
,
was
about
to
descend
when
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
Nizza
Macascree
on
the
great
staircase
,
and
instantly
flew
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
a
word
with
you
,
sweetheart
,
"
he
cried
,
taking
her
hand
,
which
she
did
not
dare
to
withdraw
.
 
<EOS>
Ready
to
sink
with
confusion
,
Nizza
suffered
herself
to
be
led
towards
the
receiving
-
room
.
<EOS>
Motioning
to
the
courtiers
to
remain
without
,
Charles
entered
it
with
his
blushing
companion
,
and
after
putting
several
questions
to
her
,
which
she
answered
with
great
timidity
and
modesty
,
inquired
into
the
state
of
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
"
Answer
me
frankly
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Are
your
affections
engaged
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Since
your
majesty
deigns
to
interest
yourself
so
much
about
me
,
"
replied
Nizza
,
"
I
will
use
no
disguise
.
<EOS>
They
are
.
"
 
"
<EOS>
To
whom
?
"
demanded
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
Leonard
Holt
,
"
was
the
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
the
apprentice
who
brought
Amabel
hither
!
"
cried
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
Earl
of
Rochester
seemed
to
intimate
that
he
was
in
love
with
Amabel
.
<EOS>
Is
it
so
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
deny
it
,
"
replied
Nizza
,
hanging
down
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
this
is
the
case
,
it
is
incumbent
on
me
to
provide
you
with
a
new
lover
,
"
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
What
will
you
say
,
sweetheart
,
if
I
tell
you
,
you
have
made
a
royal
conquest
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
tremble
to
hear
it
,
"
replied
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
But
your
majesty
is
jesting
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
my
soul
,
no
!
"
rejoined
the
king
,
passionately
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
seen
beauty
equal
to
yours
,
sweetheart
--
never
have
been
so
suddenly
,
so
completely
captivated
before
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
do
not
use
this
language
towards
me
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Nizza
,
dropping
on
her
knee
before
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
unworthy
your
notice
.
<EOS>
My
heart
is
entirely
given
to
Leonard
Holt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
speedily
forget
him
in
the
brilliant
destiny
which
awaits
you
,
child
,
"
returned
Charles
,
raising
her
.
"
<EOS>
Do
not
bestow
another
thought
on
the
senseless
dolt
who
can
prefer
Amabel
's
sickly
charms
to
your
piquant
attractions
.
<EOS>
By
Heaven
!
<EOS>
you
shall
be
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
exclaimed
Nizza
,
extricating
herself
from
his
grasp
,
and
rushing
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
fly
in
vain
,
"
cried
the
king
,
laughingly
pursuing
her
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
the
door
opened
,
and
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
knight
started
on
seeing
how
matters
stood
,
and
the
king
looked
surprised
and
angry
.
<EOS>
Taking
advantage
of
their
embarrassment
,
Nizza
made
good
her
retreat
,
and
hurrying
to
Amabel
's
chamber
,
closed
and
bolted
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Amabel
,
startled
by
her
agitated
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
is
here
,
"
replied
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
him
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
not
all
.
<EOS>
I
am
unlucky
enough
to
have
attracted
the
king
's
fancy
.
<EOS>
He
has
terrified
me
with
his
proposals
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Our
persecution
is
never
to
end
,
"
rejoined
Amabel
;
"
you
are
as
unfortunate
as
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
there
is
no
possibility
of
escape
,
"
returned
Nizza
,
bursting
into
tears
;
we
are
snared
like
birds
in
the
nets
of
the
fowler
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
fly
with
Leonard
if
you
choose
,
"
replied
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
leave
you
--
impossible
!
"
rejoined
Nizza
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
for
it
,
then
,
but
resignation
,
"
returned
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
put
a
firm
trust
in
Heaven
,
and
no
ill
can
befall
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
After
passing
several
hours
of
the
greatest
disquietude
,
they
were
about
to
retire
to
rest
,
when
Mrs.
Buscot
tapped
at
the
door
,
and
making
herself
known
,
was
instantly
admitted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
clasping
her
niece
round
the
neck
,
"
I
tremble
to
tell
you
what
I
have
heard
.
<EOS>
Despite
the
king
's
injunctions
,
the
wicked
Earl
of
Rochester
is
determined
to
see
you
before
morning
,
and
to
force
you
to
compliance
with
his
wishes
.
<EOS>
You
must
fly
as
soon
as
it
is
dark
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
how
am
I
to
fly
,
dear
aunt
?
"
rejoined
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
yourself
know
that
the
keys
of
the
stable
are
taken
away
,
and
that
two
of
the
king
's
attendants
will
remain
on
the
watch
all
night
.
<EOS>
How
will
it
be
possible
to
elude
their
vigilance
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
Leonard
to
manage
it
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Buscot
.
<EOS>
"
Only
prepare
to
set
out
.
<EOS>
John
Lutcombe
will
guide
you
across
the
downs
to
Kingston
Lisle
,
where
good
Mrs.
Compton
will
take
care
of
you
,
and
when
the
danger
is
over
you
can
return
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
hazardous
expedient
,
"
rejoined
Amabel
,
"
and
I
would
rather
run
all
risks
,
and
remain
here
.
<EOS>
If
the
earl
should
resort
to
violence
,
I
can
appeal
to
the
king
for
protection
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
any
regard
for
me
,
fly
,
"
cried
Nizza
Macascree
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
lost
if
I
remain
here
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
_
your
_
sake
I
will
go
,
then
,
"
returned
Amabel
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
have
a
foreboding
that
I
am
running
into
the
teeth
of
danger
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
say
not
so
,
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Buscot
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
persuaded
it
is
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
I
must
leave
you
now
,
but
I
will
send
Leonard
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
needless
,
"
replied
Amabel
.
"
<EOS>
Let
him
come
to
us
at
the
proper
time
.
<EOS>
We
will
be
ready
.
"
 
<EOS>
To
explain
the
cause
of
Mrs.
Buscot
's
alarm
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
return
to
the
receiving
-
room
,
and
ascertain
what
occurred
after
Nizza
's
flight
.
<EOS>
Charles
,
who
at
first
had
been
greatly
annoyed
by
Parravicin
's
abrupt
entrance
,
speedily
recovered
his
temper
,
and
laughed
at
the
other
's
forced
apologies
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
find
I
have
a
rival
in
your
majesty
,
"
observed
the
knight
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
unlucky
for
me
that
you
have
encountered
Nizza
.
<EOS>
Her
charms
were
certain
to
inflame
you
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
tell
you
I
am
desperately
enamoured
of
her
,
I
am
persuaded
you
will
not
interfere
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
I
will
do
,
"
replied
the
good
-
humoured
monarch
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
your
mentioning
that
you
once
played
with
a
Captain
Disbrowe
for
his
wife
,
and
won
her
from
him
.
<EOS>
We
will
play
for
this
girl
in
the
same
manner
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
your
majesty
is
a
far
more
skilful
player
than
Disbrowe
,
"
replied
Parravicin
,
reluctantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
matters
not
,
"
rejoined
the
monarch
;
"
the
chances
will
be
more
equal
--
or
rather
the
advantage
will
be
greatly
on
your
side
,
<EOS>
for
you
are
allowed
to
be
the
luckiest
and
best
player
at
my
court
.
<EOS>
If
I
win
,
she
is
mine
.
<EOS>
If
,
on
the
contrary
,
fortune
favours
you
,
I
resign
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Since
there
is
no
avoiding
it
,
I
accept
the
challenge
,
"
replied
Parravicin
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
decision
shall
not
be
delayed
an
instant
,
"
cried
Charles
,
"
<EOS>
What
,
ho!--dice!--dice
!
"
 
<EOS>
An
attendant
answering
the
summons
,
he
desired
that
the
other
courtiers
should
be
admitted
,
and
dice
brought
.
<EOS>
The
latter
order
could
not
be
so
easily
obeyed
,
there
being
no
such
articles
at
Ashdown
;
and
the
attendants
were
driven
to
their
wits
'
ends
,
when
Pillichody
chancing
to
overhear
what
was
going
forward
,
produced
a
box
and
dice
,
which
were
instantly
conveyed
to
the
king
,
and
the
play
commenced
.
<EOS>
Charles
,
to
his
inexpressible
delight
and
Parravicin
's
chagrin
,
came
off
the
winner
,
and
the
mortification
of
the
latter
was
increased
by
the
laughter
and
taunts
of
the
spectators
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
in
your
usual
luck
to
-
day
,
"
observed
Rochester
to
him
,
as
they
walked
aside
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
all
this
,
do
not
think
I
will
surrender
Nizza
,
"
replied
Parravicin
,
in
a
low
tone
,
"
I
love
her
too
well
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
blame
you
,
"
replied
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
Step
this
way
,
"
he
added
,
drawing
him
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
intention
to
carry
off
Amabel
to
-
night
,
notwithstanding
old
Rowley
's
injunctions
to
the
contrary
,
and
I
propose
to
accomplish
my
purpose
in
the
following
manner
.
<EOS>
I
will
frighten
her
into
flying
with
Leonard
Holt
,
and
will
then
secretly
follow
her
.
<EOS>
Nizza
Macascree
is
sure
to
accompany
her
,
and
will
,
therefore
,
be
in
your
power
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
capital
project
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pillichody
has
contrived
to
ingratiate
himself
with
Blaize
,
"
pursued
the
earl
,
"
and
through
him
the
matter
can
be
easily
managed
.
<EOS>
The
keys
of
the
stables
,
which
are
now
intrusted
to
Chiffinch
,
shall
be
stolen
--
<EOS>
the
horses
set
free
--
and
the
two
damsels
caught
in
the
trap
prepared
for
them
,
while
the
only
person
blamed
in
the
matter
will
be
Leonard
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bravo
!
"
exclaimed
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
impatient
for
the
scheme
to
be
put
into
execution
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
set
about
it
at
once
,
"
returned
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
And
separating
from
Parravicin
,
he
formed
some
excuse
for
quitting
the
royal
presence
.
 
<EOS>
About
an
hour
afterwards
,
Pillichody
sought
out
Blaize
,
and
told
him
,
with
a
very
mysterious
air
,
that
he
had
something
to
confide
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
my
regard
for
the
Earl
of
Rochester
and
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
that
I
would
do
anything
an
honourable
man
ought
to
do
to
assist
them
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
certain
bounds
which
even
friendship
can
not
induce
me
to
pass
.
<EOS>
They
meditate
the
worst
designs
against
Amabel
and
Nizza
Macascree
,
and
intend
to
accomplish
their
base
purpose
before
daybreak
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
give
you
notice
,
that
you
may
acquaint
Leonard
Holt
with
the
dangerous
situation
of
the
poor
girls
,
and
contrive
their
escape
in
the
early
part
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
I
will
steal
the
keys
of
the
stable
for
you
from
Chiffinch
,
and
will
render
you
every
assistance
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
are
discovered
,
you
must
not
betray
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
for
the
world
!
"
replied
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
we
are
infinitely
obliged
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
horrible
design
,
and
must
be
prevented
.
<EOS>
I
wish
all
this
flying
and
escaping
was
over
.
<EOS>
I
desire
to
be
quiet
,
and
am
quite
sorry
to
leave
this
charming
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
alternative
now
,
"
rejoined
Pillichody
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
it
appears
,
"
groaned
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
The
substance
of
Pillichody
's
communication
was
immediately
conveyed
to
Leonard
,
who
told
Blaize
to
acquaint
his
informer
that
he
should
have
two
pieces
of
gold
,
if
he
brought
them
the
keys
.
<EOS>
To
obtain
them
was
not
very
difficult
,
and
the
bully
was
aided
in
accomplishing
the
task
by
the
Earl
of
Rochester
in
the
following
manner
.
<EOS>
Chiffinch
was
an
inordinate
drinker
,
and
satisfied
he
could
turn
this
failing
to
account
,
the
earl
went
into
the
ball
where
he
was
stationed
,
and
after
a
little
conversation
,
called
for
a
flask
of
wine
.
<EOS>
It
was
brought
,
and
while
they
were
quaffing
bumpers
,
Pillichody
,
who
had
entered
unperceived
,
contrived
to
open
a
table
-
drawer
in
which
the
keys
were
placed
,
and
slip
them
noiselessly
into
his
doublet
.
<EOS>
He
then
stole
away
,
and
delivered
his
prize
to
Blaize
,
receiving
in
return
the
promised
reward
,
and
chuckling
to
himself
at
the
success
of
his
roguery
.
<EOS>
The
keys
were
conveyed
by
the
porter
to
Leonard
,
and
the
latter
handed
them
in
his
turn
to
John
Lutcombe
,
who
engaged
to
have
the
horses
at
the
lower
end
of
the
south
avenue
an
hour
before
midnight
.
  
<EOS>
IX
.
 
<EOS>
KINGSTON
LISLE
.
 
<EOS>
About
half
-
past
ten
,
and
when
it
was
supposed
that
the
king
and
his
courtiers
had
retired
to
rest
(
for
early
hours
were
kept
in
those
days
)
,
Mrs.
Buscot
and
Leonard
repaired
to
Amabel
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
The
good
housekeeper
noticed
with
great
uneasiness
that
her
niece
looked
excessively
pale
and
agitated
,
and
she
would
have
persuaded
her
to
abandon
all
idea
of
flight
,
if
she
had
not
feared
that
her
stay
might
be
attended
with
still
worse
consequences
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
party
set
out
,
Mrs.
Buscot
crept
down
stairs
to
see
that
all
was
safe
,
and
returned
almost
instantly
,
with
the
very
satisfactory
intelligence
that
Chiffinch
was
snoring
in
a
chair
in
the
hall
,
and
that
the
usher
had
probably
retired
to
rest
,
as
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
Not
a
moment
,
therefore
,
was
to
be
lost
,
and
they
descended
the
great
staircase
as
noiselessly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
So
far
all
had
gone
well
;
but
on
gaining
the
hall
,
Amabel
's
strength
completely
deserted
her
,
and
if
Leonard
had
not
caught
her
in
his
arms
,
she
must
have
fallen
.
<EOS>
He
was
hurrying
forward
with
his
burden
towards
a
passage
on
the
right
,
when
Chiffinch
,
who
had
been
disturbed
by
the
noise
,
suddenly
started
to
his
feet
,
and
commanded
him
to
stop
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
a
figure
enveloped
in
a
cloak
darted
from
behind
a
door
,
and
extinguishing
the
lamp
which
Chiffinch
had
taken
from
the
table
,
seized
him
with
a
powerful
grasp
.
<EOS>
All
was
now
buried
in
darkness
,
and
while
Leonard
Holt
was
hesitating
what
to
do
,
he
heard
a
voice
,
which
he
knew
to
be
that
of
Pillichody
,
whisper
in
his
ear
,
"
<EOS>
Come
with
me
--
I
will
secure
your
retreat
.
<EOS>
Quick
!
<EOS>
quick
!
"
 
<EOS>
Suffering
himself
to
be
drawn
along
,
and
closely
followed
by
Nizza
Macascree
and
Mrs.
Buscot
,
Leonard
crossed
the
dining
-
chamber
,
not
without
stumbling
against
some
of
the
furniture
by
the
way
,
and
through
an
open
window
into
the
court
,
where
he
found
Blaize
awaiting
him
.
<EOS>
Without
waiting
for
thanks
,
Pillichody
then
disappeared
,
and
Mrs.
Buscot
,
having
pointed
out
the
course
he
ought
to
pursue
,
bade
him
farewell
.
 
<EOS>
Hurrying
across
the
court
,
he
reached
the
south
avenue
,
but
had
not
proceeded
far
when
it
became
evident
,
from
the
lights
at
the
windows
,
as
well
as
from
the
shouts
and
other
noises
proceeding
from
the
court
,
that
their
flight
was
discovered
.
<EOS>
Encumbered
as
he
was
by
his
lovely
burden
,
Leonard
ran
on
so
swiftly
,
that
Nizza
Macascree
and
Blaize
could
scarcely
keep
up
with
him
.
<EOS>
They
found
John
Lutcombe
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
with
the
horses
,
and
mounting
them
,
set
off
along
the
downs
,
accompanied
by
the
keeper
,
who
acted
as
their
guide
.
<EOS>
Striking
off
on
the
right
,
they
came
to
a
spot
covered
over
with
immense
grey
stones
,
resembling
those
rocky
fragments
used
by
the
Druids
in
the
construction
of
a
cromlech
,
and
,
as
it
was
quite
dark
,
it
required
some
caution
in
passing
through
them
.
<EOS>
Guided
by
the
keeper
,
who
here
took
hold
of
the
bridle
of
his
horse
,
Leonard
threaded
the
pass
with
safety
;
but
Blaize
was
not
equally
fortunate
.
<EOS>
Alarmed
by
the
sounds
in
the
rear
,
and
not
attending
to
the
keeper
's
caution
,
he
urged
his
horse
on
,
and
the
animal
coming
in
contact
with
a
stone
,
stumbled
,
and
precipitated
him
and
Nizza
Macascree
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Luckily
,
neither
of
them
fell
against
the
stone
,
or
the
consequences
might
have
been
fatal
.
<EOS>
John
Lutcombe
instantly
flew
to
their
aid
,
but
before
he
reached
them
,
Nizza
Macascree
had
regained
her
feet
.
<EOS>
Blaize
,
however
,
who
was
considerably
shaken
and
bruised
by
the
fall
,
was
not
quite
so
expeditious
,
and
his
dilatoriness
so
provoked
the
keeper
,
that
,
seizing
him
in
his
arms
,
he
lifted
him
into
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
Just
as
Nizza
Macascree
was
placed
on
the
pillion
behind
him
,
the
tramp
of
horses
was
heard
rapidly
approaching
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
their
pursuers
came
up
,
and
the
foremost
,
whose
tones
proclaimed
him
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
commanded
them
to
stop
.
<EOS>
Inexpressibly
alarmed
,
Amabel
could
not
repress
a
scream
,
and
guided
by
the
sound
,
the
earl
dashed
to
her
side
,
and
seized
the
bridle
of
her
steed
.
 
<EOS>
A
short
struggle
took
place
between
him
and
Leonard
,
in
which
the
hitter
strove
to
break
away
;
but
the
earl
,
drawing
his
sword
,
held
it
to
his
throat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Deliver
up
your
mistress
instantly
,
"
he
cried
,
in
a
menacing
tone
,
"
or
you
are
a
dead
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
returned
a
peremptory
refusal
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
exclaimed
Amabel
,
springing
from
the
horse
;
"
I
will
not
be
the
cause
of
bloodshed
.
<EOS>
I
implore
you
,
my
lord
,
to
desist
from
this
outrage
.
<EOS>
You
will
gain
nothing
by
it
but
my
death
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
him
touch
you
at
his
peril
,
"
cried
John
Lutcombe
,
rushing
towards
them
,
and
interposing
his
stalwart
person
between
her
and
the
earl
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stand
aside
,
dog
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rochester
furiously
,
"
or
I
will
trample
you
beneath
my
horse
's
hoofs
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
first
get
near
me
to
do
it
,
"
rejoined
the
keeper
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
he
struck
the
horse
so
violent
a
blow
with
a
stout
oaken
cudgel
with
which
he
was
provided
,
that
the
animal
became
unmanageable
,
and
dashed
across
the
downs
to
some
distance
with
his
rider
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Parravicin
having
ridden
up
with
Pillichody
<EOS>
(
for
they
proved
to
be
the
earl
's
companions
)
assailed
Blaize
,
and
commanded
him
to
deliver
up
Nizza
Macascree
.
<EOS>
Scared
almost
out
of
his
senses
,
the
porter
would
have
instantly
complied
,
if
the
piper
's
daughter
had
not
kept
fast
hold
of
him
,
and
reproaching
him
with
his
cowardice
,
screamed
loudly
for
help
.
<EOS>
Heedless
of
her
cries
,
Parravicin
seized
her
,
and
strove
to
drag
her
from
the
horse
;
but
she
only
clung
the
closer
to
Blaize
,
and
the
other
,
expecting
every
moment
to
pay
another
visit
to
the
ground
,
added
his
vociferations
for
assistance
to
hers
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
go
your
hold
,
"
he
cried
,
to
Pillichody
,
who
had
seized
him
on
the
other
side
by
the
collar
.
"
<EOS>
Leave
go
,
I
say
,
or
you
will
rend
my
jerkin
asunder
.
<EOS>
What
are
you
doing
here
?
<EOS>
I
thought
you
were
to
help
us
to
escape
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
have
done
,
"
rejoined
Pillichody
,
bursting
into
a
loud
laugh
;
"
and
I
am
now
helping
to
catch
you
again
.
<EOS>
What
a
blind
buzzard
you
must
be
not
to
perceive
the
net
spread
for
you
!
<EOS>
Deliver
up
Nizza
Macascree
without
more
ado
,
or
,
by
all
the
fiends
,
I
will
pay
you
off
for
your
dastardly
assault
upon
me
this
morning
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
deliver
her
up
,
"
cried
Blaize
;
"
she
sticks
to
me
as
fast
as
a
burr
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
torn
asunder
between
you
.
<EOS>
Help
!
<EOS>
help
!
"
 
<EOS>
Parravicin
,
having
dismounted
,
now
tore
away
Nizza
Macascree
,
and
was
just
about
to
transfer
her
to
his
own
steed
,
when
John
Lutcombe
,
having
driven
away
the
earl
in
the
manner
before
described
,
came
to
the
rescue
.
<EOS>
One
blow
from
his
cudgel
stretched
the
knight
on
the
sod
,
and
liberated
Nizza
Macascree
,
who
instantly
flew
to
her
preserver
.
<EOS>
Finding
how
matters
stood
,
and
that
he
was
likely
to
be
well
backed
,
Blaize
plucked
up
his
courage
,
and
grappled
with
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
In
the
struggle
they
both
tumbled
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
keeper
rushed
towards
them
,
and
seizing
Pillichody
,
began
to
belabour
him
soundly
.
<EOS>
In
vain
the
bully
implored
mercy
.
<EOS>
He
underwent
a
severe
chastisement
,
and
Blaize
added
a
few
kicks
to
the
shower
of
blows
proceeding
from
the
keeper
,
crying
,
as
he
dealt
them
,
"
Who
is
the
buzzard
now
,
I
should
like
to
know
?
"
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
Parravicin
had
regained
his
legs
,
and
the
Earl
of
Rochester
having
forced
back
his
steed
,
both
drew
their
swords
,
and
,
burning
for
vengeance
,
prepared
to
renew
the
charge
.
<EOS>
The
affair
might
have
assumed
a
serious
aspect
,
if
it
had
not
chanced
that
at
this
juncture
lights
were
seen
hurrying
along
the
avenue
,
and
the
next
moment
,
a
large
party
issued
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
king
?
"
cried
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
to
be
done
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Our
prey
must
be
abandoned
,
"
rejoined
Parravicin
;
"
it
will
never
do
to
be
caught
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
he
sprang
upon
his
steed
,
and
disappeared
across
the
downs
with
the
earl
.
 
<EOS>
John
Lutcombe
,
on
perceiving
the
approach
of
the
torch
-
bearers
,
instantly
abandoned
Pillichody
,
and
assisting
Blaize
to
the
saddle
,
placed
Nizza
behind
him
.
<EOS>
Leonard
,
likewise
,
who
had
dismounted
to
support
Amabel
,
replaced
her
in
the
pillion
,
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
party
were
in
motion
.
<EOS>
Pillichody
,
who
was
the
only
person
now
left
,
did
not
care
to
wait
for
the
king
's
arrival
,
but
snatching
the
bridle
of
his
steed
,
which
was
quietly
grazing
at
a
little
distance
,
mounted
him
,
and
galloped
off
in
the
direction
which
he
fancied
had
been
taken
by
the
earl
and
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
Guided
by
the
keeper
,
who
ran
beside
them
,
the
fugitives
proceeded
for
a
couple
of
miles
at
a
rapid
pace
over
the
downs
,
when
,
it
not
appearing
that
they
were
followed
,
John
Lutcombe
halted
for
a
moment
to
recover
breath
.
<EOS>
The
fresh
air
had
in
some
degree
revived
Amabel
,
and
the
circumstance
of
their
providential
deliverance
raised
the
spirits
of
the
whole
party
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
they
reached
the
ridge
of
the
downs
,
the
magnificent
view
from
which
was
completely
hidden
by
the
shades
of
night
,
and
,
tracking
the
old
Roman
road
for
about
a
mile
,
descended
the
steep
hill
in
the
direction
of
the
Blowing
Stone
.
<EOS>
Skirting
a
thick
grove
of
trees
,
they
presently
came
to
a
gate
,
which
the
keeper
opened
,
and
led
them
through
an
orchard
towards
what
appeared
to
be
in
the
gloom
a
moderately
-
sized
and
comfortable
habitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
owner
of
this
house
,
Mrs.
Compton
,
"
observed
John
Lutcombe
to
Amabel
,
"
is
a
widow
,
and
the
kindest
lady
in
Berkshire
.
<EOS>
A
message
has
been
sent
by
your
aunt
to
beg
her
to
afford
you
an
asylum
for
a
few
days
,
and
I
will
answer
for
it
you
will
be
hospitably
received
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
the
loud
barking
of
a
dog
was
heard
,
and
an
old
grey
-
headed
butler
was
seen
advancing
towards
them
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
a
groom
issued
from
the
stable
on
the
right
,
accompanied
by
the
dog
in
question
,
and
,
hastening
towards
them
,
assisted
them
to
dismount
.
<EOS>
The
dog
seemed
to
recognise
the
keeper
,
and
leaped
upon
him
,
licked
his
hand
,
and
exhibited
other
symptoms
of
delight
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
,
Ringwood
,
"
cried
the
keeper
,
patting
his
head
,
"
dost
thou
know
thy
old
master
again
?
<EOS>
I
see
you
have
taken
good
care
of
him
,
Sam
,
"
he
added
to
the
groom
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
I
was
placing
him
into
good
hands
when
I
gave
him
to
Mrs.
Compton
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
he
ca
n't
find
a
better
home
,
I
fancy
,
"
said
the
groom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
it
please
you
to
walk
this
way
,
ladies
?
<EOS>
"
interposed
the
butler
.
<EOS>
"
My
mistress
has
been
expecting
you
for
some
time
,
and
had
become
quite
uneasy
about
you
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
led
the
way
through
a
garden
,
filled
with
the
odours
of
a
hundred
unseen
flowers
,
and
ushered
them
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Compton
,
an
elderly
lady
,
of
very
pleasing
exterior
,
received
them
with
great
kindness
,
and
conducted
them
to
a
comfortable
apartment
,
surrounded
with
book
-
shelves
and
old
family
portraits
,
where
refreshments
were
spread
out
for
them
.
<EOS>
The
good
old
lady
seemed
particularly
interested
in
Amabel
,
and
pressed
her
,
but
in
vain
,
to
partake
of
the
refreshments
.
<EOS>
With
extreme
delicacy
,
she
refrained
from
inquiring
into
the
cause
of
their
visit
,
and
seeing
that
they
appeared
,
much
fatigued
,
rang
for
a
female
attendant
,
and
conducted
them
to
a
sleeping
-
chamber
,
where
she
took
leave
of
them
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
Amabel
was
delighted
with
her
kind
hostess
,
and
,
contrary
to
her
expectations
and
to
those
of
Nizza
Macascree
,
enjoyed
undisturbed
repose
.
<EOS>
She
awoke
in
the
morning
greatly
refreshed
,
and
,
after
attiring
herself
,
gazed
through
her
chamber
window
.
<EOS>
It
looked
upon
a
trim
and
beautiful
garden
,
with
a
green
and
mossy
plot
carved
out
into
quaintly
-
fashioned
beds
,
filled
with
the
choicest
flowers
,
and
surrounded
by
fine
timber
,
amid
which
a
tall
fir
-
tree
appeared
proudly
conspicuous
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Compton
,
who
,
it
appeared
,
always
arose
with
the
sun
,
was
busied
in
tending
her
flowers
,
and
as
Amabel
watched
her
interesting
pursuits
,
she
could
scarcely
help
envying
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
delightful
life
your
mistress
must
lead
,
"
she
observed
to
a
female
attendant
who
was
present
;
"
I
can
not
imagine
greater
happiness
than
hers
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
mistress
ought
to
be
happy
,
"
said
the
attendant
;
"
for
there
is
no
one
living
who
does
more
good
.
<EOS>
Not
a
cottage
nor
a
farm
-
house
in
the
neighbourhood
<EOS>
but
she
visits
to
inquire
whether
she
can
be
of
any
service
to
its
inmates
;
and
wherever
her
services
_
are
_
required
,
they
are
always
rendered
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Compton
's
name
will
never
be
forgotten
in
Kingston
Lisle
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
Amabel
caught
sight
of
the
benevolent
countenance
of
the
good
old
lady
looking
up
at
the
window
,
and
a
kindly
greeting
passed
between
them
.
<EOS>
Ringwood
,
who
was
a
privileged
intruder
,
was
careering
round
the
garden
,
and
though
his
mistress
watched
his
gambols
round
her
favourite
flower
-
beds
with
some
anxiety
,
she
did
not
check
him
.
<EOS>
Amabel
and
Nizza
now
went
down
stairs
,
and
Mrs.
Compton
returning
from
the
garden
,
all
the
household
,
including
Leonard
and
Blaize
,
assembled
in
the
breakfast
-
room
for

Breakfast
over
,
Mrs.
Compton
entered
into
conversation
with
Amabel
,
and
ascertained
all
the
particulars
of
her
history
.
<EOS>
She
was
greatly
interested
in
it
,
but
did
not
affect
to
conceal
the
anxiety
it
gave
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yours
is
really
a
very
dangerous
position
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
I
should
be
acting
unfairly
towards
you
if
I
told
you
otherwise
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
will
give
you
all
the
protection
in
my
power
,
and
I
trust
your
retreat
may
not
be
discovered
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Compton
's
remark
did
not
tend
to
dispel
Amabel
's
uneasiness
,
and
both
she
and
Nizza
Macascree
passed
a
day
of
great
disquietude
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
Leonard
and
Blaize
were
treated
with
great
hospitality
by
the
old
butler
in
the
servants
'
hall
;
and
though
the
former
was
not
without
apprehension
that
their
retreat
might
be
discovered
,
he
trusted
,
if
it
were
so
,
to
some
fortunate
chance
to
effect
their
escape
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
dare
to
confide
his
apprehensions
to
the
butler
,
nor
did
the
other
make
any
inquiries
;
but
it
being
understood
that
their
visit
was
to
be
secret
,
every
precaution
was
taken
to
keep
it
so
.
<EOS>
John
Lutcombe
had
tarried
no
longer
than
enabled
him
to
discuss
a
jug
of
ale
,
and
then
set
out
for
Ashdown
,
promising
to
return
on
the
following
day
;
but
he
had
not
yet
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
Evening
arrived
,
and
nothing
alarming
having
occurred
,
all
became
comparatively
easy
;
and
Mrs.
Compton
herself
,
who
had
looked
unusually
grave
throughout
the
day
,
now
recovered
her
wonted
cheerfulness
.
 
<EOS>
Their
satisfaction
,
however
,
was
not
long
afterwards
disturbed
by
the
arrival
of
a
large
train
of
horsemen
at
the
gate
,
and
a
stately
personage
alighted
,
and
walked
at
the
head
of
a
gallant
train
,
towards
the
house
.
<EOS>
At
the
sight
of
the
new
-
comers
,
whom
they
instantly
knew
were
the
king
and
his
suite
,
Amabel
and
Nizza
Macascree
flew
upstairs
,
and
shutting
themselves
in
their
chamber
,
awaited
the
result
in
the
utmost
trepidation
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
kept
long
in
suspense
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
the
king
's
arrival
,
Mrs.
Compton
herself
knocked
at
the
door
,
and
in
a
tone
of
deep
commiseration
,
informed
Amabel
that
his
majesty
desired
to
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
Knowing
<EOS>
that
refusal
was
impossible
,
Amabel
complied
,
and
descended
to
a
room
looking
upon
the
garden
,
in
which
she
found
the
king
.
<EOS>
He
was
attended
only
by
Chiffinch
,
and
received
her
with
a
somewhat
severe
aspect
,
and
demanded
why
she
had
left
Ashdown
contrary
to
his
express
injunctions
?
 
<EOS>
Amabel
stated
her
motives
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
you
tell
me
is
by
no
means
satisfactory
,
"
rejoined
the
king
;
"
but
since
you
have
chosen
to
trust
to
yourself
,
you
can
no
longer
look
for
protection
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
beseech
your
majesty
to
consider
the
strait
into
which
I
was
driven
,
"
returned
Amabel
,
imploringly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Summon
the
Earl
of
Rochester
to
the
presence
,
"
said
the
king
,
turning
from
her
to
Chiffinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
pity
,
sire
,
"
cried
Amabel
,
throwing
herself
at
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
the
injunction
be
obeyed
,
"
rejoined
Charles
,
peremptorily
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
chief
page
departed
.
 
<EOS>
Amabel
instantly
arose
,
and
drew
herself
proudly
up
.
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
,
Rochester
made
his
appearance
,
and
on
seeing
Amabel
,
a
flush
of
triumphant
joy
overspread
his
features
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
withdraw
my
interdiction
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
king
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
at
liberty
to
renew
your
suit
to
this
girl
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
,
Lord
Rochester
,
"
said
Amabel
,
addressing
the
earl
;
"
I
have
conquered
the
passion
I
once
felt
for
you
,
and
regard
you
only
as
one
who
has
sought
my
ruin
,
and
from
whom
I
have
fortunately
escaped
.
<EOS>
When
you
learn
from
my
own
lips
that
my
heart
is
dead
to
you
,
that
I
never
can
love
you
more
,
and
that
I
only
desire
to
be
freed
from
your
addresses
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
doubt
but
you
will
discontinue
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
declaration
only
inflames
me
the
more
,
lovely
Amabel
,
"
replied
the
earl
,
passionately
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
,
and
shall
be
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
my
death
will
rest
at
your
door
,
"
she
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
my
chance
of
that
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
,
carelessly
.
 
<EOS>
Amabel
then
quitted
the
king
's
presence
,
and
returned
to
her
own
chamber
,
where
she
found
Nizza
Macascree
in
a
state
of
indescribable
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
has
happened
that
I
anticipated
,
"
said
she
to
Nizza
Macascree
.
<EOS>
"
The
king
will
no
longer
protect
me
,
and
I
am
exposed
to
the
persecutions
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
who
is
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
,
an
usher
entered
,
and
informed
Nizza
Macascree
that
the
king
commanded
her
presence
.
<EOS>
The
piper
's
daughter
looked
at
Amabel
with
a
glance
of
unutterable
anguish
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
you
must
go
,
"
said
Amabel
,
"
but
Heaven
will
protect
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
They
then
tenderly
embraced
each
other
,
and
Nizza
Macascree
departed
with
the
usher
.
 
<EOS>
Some
time
having
elapsed
,
and
Nizza
not
returning
,
Amabel
became
seriously
uneasy
.
<EOS>
Hearing
a
noise
below
,
she
looked
forth
from
the
window
,
and
perceived
the
king
and
all
his
train
departing
.
<EOS>
A
terrible
foreboding
shot
through
her
heart
.
<EOS>
She
gazed
anxiously
after
them
,
but
could
not
perceive
Nizza
Macascree
.
<EOS>
Overcome
at
last
by
her
anxiety
,
she
rushed
down
stairs
,
and
had
just
reached
the
last
step
,
when
she
was
seized
by
two
persons
.
<EOS>
A
shawl
was
passed
over
her
head
,
and
she
was
forced
out
of
the
house
.

I.
 
<EOS>
THE
PLAGUE
<EOS>
AT
ITS
HEIGHT
.
 
<EOS>
Amabel
's
departure
for
Berkshire
caused
no
change
in
her
father
's
mode
of
life
.
<EOS>
Everything
proceeded
as
before
within
his
quiet
dwelling
;
and
,
except
that
the
family
were
diminished
in
number
,
all
appeared
the
same
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
they
wanted
the
interest
,
and
indeed
the
occupation
,
afforded
them
by
the
gentle
invalid
,
but
in
other
respects
,
no
difference
was
observable
.
<EOS>
Devotional
exercises
,
meals
,
the
various
duties
of
the
house
,
and
cheerful
discourse
,
filled
up
the
day
,
which
never
proved
wearisome
.
<EOS>
The
result
proved
the
correctness
of
Mr.
Bloundel
's
judgment
.
<EOS>
While
the
scourge
continued
weekly
to
extend
its
ravages
throughout
the
city
,
it
never
crossed
his
threshold
;
and
,
except
suffering
in
a
slight
degree
from
scorbutic
affections
,
occasioned
by
the
salt
meats
to
which
they
were
now
confined
,
and
for
which
the
lemon
and
lime
-
juice
,
provided
against
such
a
contingency
,
proved
an
efficacious
remedy
,
all
the
family
enjoyed
perfect
health
.
<EOS>
For
some
weeks
after
her
separation
from
her
daughter
,
Mrs.
Bloundel
continued
in
a
desponding
state
,
but
after
that
time
she
became
more
reconciled
to
the
deprivation
,
and
partially
recovered
her
spirits
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
did
not
dare
to
indulge
a
hope
that
Amabel
would
ever
return
;
but
though
he
suffered
much
in
secret
,
he
never
allowed
his
grief
to
manifest
itself
.
<EOS>
The
circumstance
that
he
had
not
received
any
intelligence
of
her
did
not
weigh
much
with
him
,
because
the
difficulty
of
communication
became
greater
and
greater
,
as
each
week
the
scourge
increased
in
violence
,
and
he
was
inclined
to
take
no
news
as
good
news
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
so
in
the
present
case
,
but
of
this
he
was
happily
ignorant
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
a
month
passed
on
.
<EOS>
And
now
every
other
consideration
was
merged
in
the
alarm
occasioned
by
the
daily
increasing
fury
of
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
Throughout
July
the
excessive
heat
of
the
weather
underwent
no
abatement
,
but
in
place
of
the
clear
atmosphere
that
had
prevailed
during
the
preceding
month
,
unwholesome
blights
filled
the
air
,
and
,
confining
the
pestilential
effluvia
,
spread
the
contagion
far
and
wide
with
extraordinary
rapidity
.
<EOS>
Not
only
was
the
city
suffocated
with
heat
,
but
filled
with
noisome
smells
,
arising
from
the
carcasses
with
which
the
close
alleys
and
other
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
places
were
crowded
,
and
which
were
so
far
decomposed
as
not
to
be
capable
of
removal
.
<EOS>
The
aspect
of
the
river
was
as
much
changed
as
that
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
Numbers
of
bodies
were
thrown
into
it
,
and
,
floating
up
with
the
tide
,
were
left
to
taint
the
air
on
its
banks
,
while
strange
,
ill
-
omened
fowl
,
attracted
thither
by
their
instinct
,
preyed
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Below
the
bridge
,
all
captains
of
ships
moored
in
the
Pool
,
or
off
Wapping
,
held
as
little
communication
as
possible
with
those
on
shore
,
and
only
received
fresh
provisions
with
the
greatest
precaution
.
<EOS>
As
the
plague
increased
,
most
of
these
removed
lower
down
the
river
,
and
many
of
them
put
out
entirely
to
sea
.
<EOS>
Above
the
bridge
,
most
of
the
wherries
and
other
smaller
craft
had
disappeared
,
their
owners
having
taken
them
up
the
river
,
and
moored
them
against
its
banks
at
different
spots
,
where
they
lived
in
them
under
tilts
.
<EOS>
Many
hundreds
of
persons
remained
upon
the
river
in
this
way
during
the
whole
continuance
of
the
visitation
.
 
<EOS>
August
had
now
arrived
,
but
the
distemper
knew
no
cessation
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
it
manifestly
increased
in
violence
and
malignity
.
<EOS>
The
deaths
rose
a
thousand
in
each
week
,
and
in
the
last
week
in
this
fatal
month
amounted
to
upwards
of
sixty
thousand
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
terrible
as
this
was
,
the
pestilence
had
not
yet
reached
its
height
.
<EOS>
Hopes
were
entertained
that
when
the
weather
became
cooler
,
its
fury
would
abate
;
but
these
anticipations
were
fearfully
disappointed
.
<EOS>
The
bills
of
mortality
rose
the
first
week
in
September
to
seven
thousand
,
and
though
they
slightly
decreased
during
the
second
week
--
awakening
a
momentary
hope
--
on
the
third
they
advanced
to
twelve
thousand
!
<EOS>
In
less
than
ten
days
,
upwards
of
two
thousand
persons
perished
in
the
parish
of
Aldgate
alone
;
while
Whitechapel
suffered
equally
severely
.
<EOS>
Out
of
the
hundred
parishes
in
and
about
the
city
,
one
only
,
that
of
Saint
John
the
Evangelist
in
Watling
-
street
,
remained
uninfected
,
and
this
merely
because
there
was
scarcely
a
soul
left
within
it
,
the
greater
part
of
the
inhabitants
having
quitted
their
houses
,
and
fled
into
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
The
deepest
despair
now
seized
upon
all
the
survivors
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
a
family
but
had
lost
half
of
its
number
--
many
,
more
than
half
--
while
those
who
were
left
felt
assured
that
their
turn
would
speedily
arrive
.
<EOS>
Even
the
reckless
were
appalled
,
and
abandoned
their
evil
courses
.
<EOS>
Not
only
were
the
dead
lying
in
the
passages
and
alleys
,
but
even
in
the
main
thoroughfares
,
and
none
would
remove
them
.
<EOS>
The
awful
prediction
of
Solomon
Eagle
that
"
grass
would
grow
in
the
streets
,
and
that
the
living
should
not
be
able
to
bury
the
dead
,
"
had
come
to
pass
.
<EOS>
London
had
become
one
vast
lazar
-
house
,
and
seemed
in
a
fair
way
of
becoming
a
mighty
sepulchre
.
 
<EOS>
During
all
this
time
,
Saint
Paul
's
continued
to
be
used
as
a
pest
-
house
,
but
it
was
not
so
crowded
as
heretofore
,
because
,
as
not
one
in
fifty
of
the
infected
recovered
when
placed
under
medical
care
,
it
was
not
thought
worth
while
to
remove
them
from
their
own
abodes
.
<EOS>
The
number
of
attendants
,
too
,
had
diminished
.
<EOS>
Some
had
died
,
but
the
greater
part
had
abandoned
their
offices
from
a
fear
of
sharing
the
fate
of
their
patients
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
these
changes
,
Judith
Malmayns
had
been
advanced
to
the
post
of
chief
nurse
at
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
Both
she
and
Chowles
had
been
attacked
by
the
plague
,
and
both
had
recovered
.
<EOS>
Judith
attended
the
coffin
-
maker
,
and
it
was
mainly
owing
to
her
that
he
got
through
the
attack
.
<EOS>
She
never
left
him
for
a
moment
,
and
would
never
suffer
any
one
to
approach
him
--
a
necessary
precaution
,
as
he
was
so
much
alarmed
by
his
situation
that
he
would
infallibly
have
made
some
awkward
revelations
.
<EOS>
When
Judith
,
in
her
turn
,
was
seized
,
Chowles
exhibited
no
such
consideration
for
her
,
and
scarcely
affected
to
conceal
his
disappointment
at
her
recovery
.
<EOS>
This
want
of
feeling
on
his
part
greatly
incensed
her
against
him
,
and
though
he
contrived
in
some
degree
to
appease
her
,
it
was
long
before
she
entirely
forgave
him
.
<EOS>
Far
from
being
amended
by
her
sufferings
,
she
seemed
to
have
grown
more
obdurate
,
and
instantly
commenced
a
fresh
career
of
crime
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
,
however
,
necessary
now
to
hasten
the
end
of
the
sick
.
<EOS>
The
distemper
had
acquired
such
force
and
malignity
that
it
did
its
work
quickly
enough
--
often
too
quickly
--
and
all
she
sought
was
to
obtain
possession
of
the
poor
patients
'
attire
,
or
any
valuables
they
might
possess
worth
appropriating
.
<EOS>
To
turn
to
the
brighter
side
of
the
picture
,
it
must
not
be
omitted
that
when
the
pestilence
was
at
its
height
,
and
no
offers
could
induce
the
timorous
to
venture
forth
,
or
render
assistance
to
the
sufferers
,
Sir
John
Lawrence
the
Lord
Mayor
,
the
Duke
of
Albermarle
,
the
Earl
of
Craven
,
and
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
devoted
themselves
to
the
care
of
the
infected
,
and
supplied
them
with
every
necessary
they
required
.
<EOS>
Among
the
physicians
,
no
one
deserves
more
honourable
mention
than
Doctor
Hodges
,
who
was
unremitting
in
his
attentions
to
the
sufferers
.
 
<EOS>
To
return
to
the
grocer
.
<EOS>
While
the
plague
was
thus
raging
around
him
,
and
while
every
house
in
Wood
-
street
except
one
or
two
,
from
which
the
inmates
had
fled
,
was
attacked
by
the
pestilence
,
he
and
his
family
had
remained
untouched
.
<EOS>
About
the
middle
of
August
,
he
experienced
a
great
alarm
.
<EOS>
His
second
son
,
Hubert
,
fell
sick
,
and
he
removed
him
to
one
of
the
upper
rooms
which
he
had
set
aside
as
an
hospital
,
and
attended
upon
him
himself
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
days
,
however
,
his
fears
were
removed
and
he
found
,
to
his
great
satisfaction
,
that
the
youth
had
not
been
attacked
by
the
plague
,
but
was
only
suffering
from
a
slight
fever
,
which
quickly
yielded
to
the
remedies
applied
.
<EOS>
About
the
same
time
,
too
,
he
lost
his
porter
,
Dallison
.
<EOS>
The
poor
fellow
did
not
make
his
appearance
as
usual
for
two
days
,
and
intelligence
of
his
fate
was
brought
on
the
following
day
by
his
wife
,
who
came
to
state
that
her
husband
was
dead
,
and
had
been
thrown
into
the
plague
-
pit
at
Aldgate
.
<EOS>
The
same
night
,
however
,
she
brought
another
man
,
named
Allestry
,
who
took
the
place
of
the
late
porter
,
and
acquainted
his
employer
with
the
deplorable
state
of
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
Two
days
afterwards
,
Allestry
himself
died
,
and
Mr.
Bloundel
had
no
one
to
replace
him
.
<EOS>
He
thus
lost
all
means
of
ascertaining
what
was
going
forward
;
but
the
deathlike
stillness
around
him
,
broken
only
by
the
hoarse
tolling
of
a
bell
,
by
a
wild
shriek
or
other
appalling
cry
,
proclaimed
too
surely
the
terrible
state
of
things
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
too
,
a
passenger
would
go
by
,
and
would
tell
him
the
dreadful
height
to
which
the
bills
of
mortality
had
risen
,
assuring
him
that
ere
another
month
had
expired
,
not
a
soul
would
be
left
alive
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
One
night
,
as
Solomon
Eagle
,
who
had
likewise
been
miraculously
preserved
,
pursued
his
course
through
the
streets
,
he
paused
before
Mr.
Roundel
's
house
,
and
looking
up
at
the
window
,
at
which
the
latter
had
chanced
to
be
stationed
,
cried
in
a
loud
voice
,
"
Be
of
good
cheer
.
<EOS>
You
have
served
God
faithfully
,
and
there
shall
no
evil
befall
<EOS>
you
,
neither
shall
the
plague
come
nigh
your
dwelling
.
"
<EOS>
And
raising
his
arms
,
as
if
invoking
a
blessing
upon
the
habitation
,
he
departed
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
now
the
second
week
in
September
,
and
as
yet
Mr.
Bloundel
had
received
no
tidings
of
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
At
any
other
season
he
would
have
been
seriously
uneasy
,
but
now
,
as
has
been
already
stated
,
all
private
grief
was
swallowed
up
in
the
horror
of
the
general
calamity
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
that
she
was
in
a
healthful
situation
,
and
that
her
chance
of
preservation
from
the
pestilence
was
better
than
that
of
any
other
member
of
his
family
,
he
turned
his
thoughts
entirely
to
them
.
<EOS>
Redoubling
his
precautions
,
he
tried
by
every
means
to
keep
up
the
failing
spirits
of
his
household
,
and
but
rarely
ventured
to
open
his
shutter
,
and
look
forth
on
the
external
world
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
tenth
of
September
,
which
was
afterwards
accounted
the
most
fatal
day
of
this
fatal
month
,
a
young
man
of
a
very
dejected
appearance
,
and
wearing
the
traces
of
severe
suffering
in
his
countenance
,
entered
the
west
end
of
London
,
and
took
his
way
slowly
towards
the
city
.
<EOS>
He
had
passed
Saint
Giles
's
without
seeing
a
single
living
creature
,
or
the
sign
of
one
in
any
of
the
houses
.
<EOS>
The
broad
thoroughfare
was
completely
grown
over
with
grass
,
and
the
habitations
had
the
most
melancholy
and
deserted
air
imaginable
.
<EOS>
Some
doors
and
windows
were
wide
open
,
discovering
rooms
with
goods
and
furniture
scattered
about
,
having
been
left
in
this
state
by
their
inmates
;
but
most
part
of
them
were
closely
fastened
up
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
proceeded
along
Holborn
,
the
ravages
of
the
scourge
were
yet
more
apparent
.
<EOS>
Every
house
,
on
either
side
of
the
way
,
had
a
red
cross
,
with
the
fatal
inscription
above
it
,
upon
the
door
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
a
watchman
might
be
seen
,
looking
more
like
a
phantom
than
a
living
thing
.
<EOS>
Formerly
,
the
dead
were
conveyed
away
at
night
,
but
now
the
carts
went
about
in
the
daytime
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
Saint
Andrew
's
,
Holborn
,
several
persons
were
seen
wheeling
hand
-
barrows
filled
with
corpses
,
scarcely
covered
with
clothing
,
and
revealing
the
blue
and
white
stripes
of
the
pestilence
,
towards
a
cart
which
was
standing
near
the
church
gates
.
<EOS>
The
driver
of
the
vehicle
,
a
tall
,
cadaverous
-
looking
man
,
was
ringing
his
bell
,
and
jesting
with
another
person
,
whom
the
young
man
recognised
,
with
a
shudder
,
as
Chowles
.
<EOS>
The
coffin
-
maker
also
recognised
him
at
the
same
moment
,
and
called
to
him
,
but
the
other
paid
no
attention
to
the
summons
and
passed
on
.
 
<EOS>
Crossing
Holborn
Bridge
<EOS>
,
he
toiled
faintly
up
the
opposite
hill
,
for
he
was
evidently
suffering
from
extreme
debility
,
and
on
gaining
the
summit
was
obliged
to
support
himself
against
a
wall
for
a
few
minutes
,
before
he
could
proceed
.
<EOS>
The
same
frightful
evidences
of
the
ravages
of
the
pestilence
were
observable
here
,
as
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
The
houses
were
all
marked
with
the
fatal
cross
,
and
shut
up
.
<EOS>
Another
dead
-
cart
was
heard
rumbling
along
,
accompanied
by
the
harsh
cries
of
the
driver
,
and
the
doleful
ringing
of
the
bell
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
the
loathly
vehicle
was
seen
coming
along
the
Old
Bailey
.
<EOS>
It
paused
before
a
house
,
from
which
four
bodies
were
brought
,
and
then
passed
on
towards
Smithfield
.
<EOS>
Watching
its
progress
with
fearful
curiosity
,
the
young
man
noted
how
often
it
paused
to
increase
its
load
.
<EOS>
His
thoughts
,
coloured
by
the
scene
,
were
of
the
saddest
and
dreariest
complexion
.
<EOS>
All
around
wore
the
aspect
of
death
.
<EOS>
The
few
figures
in
sight
seemed
staggering
towards
the
grave
,
and
the
houses
appeared
to
be
plague
-
stricken
like
the
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
The
heat
was
intolerably
oppressive
,
and
the
air
tainted
with
noisome
exhalations
.
<EOS>
Ever
and
anon
,
a
window
would
be
opened
,
and
a
ghastly
face
thrust
from
it
,
while
a
piercing
shriek
,
or
lamentable
cry
,
was
uttered
.
<EOS>
No
business
seemed
going
on
--
there
were
no
passengers
--
no
vehicles
in
the
streets
.
<EOS>
The
mighty
city
was
completely
laid
prostrate
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
short
rest
,
the
young
man
shaped
his
course
towards
Saint
Paul
's
,
and
on
reaching
its
western
precincts
,
gazed
for
some
time
at
the
reverend
structure
,
as
if
its
contemplation
called
up
many
and
painful
recollections
.
<EOS>
Tears
started
to
his
eyes
,
and
he
was
about
to
turn
away
,
when
he
perceived
the
figure
of
Solomon
Eagle
stationed
near
the
cross
at
the
western
extremity
of
the
roof
.
<EOS>
The
enthusiast
caught
sight
of
him
at
the
same
moment
,
and
motioned
him
to
come
nearer
.
<EOS>
"
What
has
happened
?
"
he
demanded
,
as
the
other
approached
the
steps
of
the
portico
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
man
shook
his
head
mournfully
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
sad
tale
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
can
not
be
told
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
conjecture
what
it
is
,
"
replied
Solomon
Eagle
.
<EOS>
"
But
come
to
the
small
door
near
the
northern
entrance
of
the
cathedral
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
I
will
meet
you
there
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
fail
,
"
replied
the
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
of
the
terrible
judgments
which
I
predicted
would
befall
this
devoted
city
has
come
to
pass
,
"
cried
Solomon
Eagle
.
<EOS>
"
Another
yet
remains
--
the
judgment
by
fire
--
and
if
its
surviving
inhabitants
repent
not
,
of
which
there
is
as
yet
no
sign
,
it
will
assuredly
follow
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
avert
it
!
<EOS>
"
groaned
the
other
,
turning
away
.
 
<EOS>
Proceeding
along
Cheapside
,
he
entered
Wood
-
street
,
and
took
his
way
towards
the
grocer
's
dwelling
.
<EOS>
When
at
a
little
distance
from
it
,
he
paused
,
and
some
minutes
elapsed
before
he
could
muster
strength
to
go
forward
.
<EOS>
Here
,
as
elsewhere
,
there
were
abundant
indications
of
the
havoc
occasioned
by
the
fell
disease
.
<EOS>
Not
far
from
the
grocer
's
shop
,
and
in
the
middle
of
the
street
,
lay
the
body
of
a
man
,
with
the
face
turned
upwards
,
while
crouching
in
an
angle
of
the
wall
sat
a
young
woman
watching
it
.
<EOS>
As
the
young
man
drew
nearer
,
he
recognised
in
the
dead
man
the
principal
of
the
Brotherhood
of
Saint
Michael
,
and
in
the
poor
mourner
one
of
his
profligate
female
associates
.
<EOS>
"
What
has
become
of
your
unhappy
companions
?
"
he
demanded
of
the
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
last
of
them
lies
there
,
"
she
rejoined
mournfully
.
<EOS>
"
All
the
rest
died
long
ago
.
<EOS>
My
lover
was
true
to
his
vow
;
and
instead
of
deploring
their
fate
,
lived
with
me
and
three
other
women
in
mirth
and
revelry
till
yesterday
,
when
the
three
women
died
,
and
he
fell
sick
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
,
however
,
give
in
,
but
continued
carousing
until
an
hour
before
his
death
.
"
 
<EOS>
Too
much
shocked
to
make
any
reply
,
the
young
man
proceeded
towards
the
hutch
.
<EOS>
Beneath
a
doorway
,
at
a
little
distance
from
it
,
sat
a
watchman
with
a
halberd
on
his
shoulder
,
guarding
the
house
;
but
it
was
evident
he
would
be
of
little
further
use
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
covered
with
his
hands
,
and
his
groans
proclaimed
that
he
himself
was
attacked
by
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
Entering
the
hutch
,
the
young
man
pulled
the
cord
of
the
bell
,
and
the
summons
was
soon
after
answered
by
the
grocer
,
who
appeared
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
What
,
Leonard
Holt
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
in
surprise
,
on
seeing
the
young
man--"is
it
<EOS>
you?--what
ails
you?--you
<EOS>
look
frightfully
ill
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
attacked
a
second
time
by
the
plague
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
,
"
and
am
only
just
recovered
from
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
of
my
child
?
"
cried
the
grocer
<EOS>
eagerly--"what
of
her
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
alas
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
keep
me
in
suspense
,
"
rejoined
the
grocer
.
<EOS>
"
Is
she
dead
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
dead
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
,
"
<EOS>
but--
<EOS>
"
 
"
But
what
?
"
ejaculated
the
grocer
.
"
<EOS>
In
Heaven
's
name
,
speak
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
These
letters
will
tell
you
all
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
,
producing
a
packet
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
prepared
them
to
send
to
you
in
case
of
my
death
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
equal
to
further
explanation
now
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
trembling
eagerness
the
grocer
lowered
the
rope
,
and
Leonard
having
tied
the
packet
to
it
,
it
was
instantly
drawn
up
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
his
anxiety
to
ascertain
the
fate
of
Amabel
,
Mr.
Bloundel
would
not
touch
the
packet
until
he
had
guarded
against
the
possibility
of
being
infected
by
it
.
<EOS>
Seizing
it
with
a
pair
of
tongs
,
he
plunged
it
into
a
pan
containing
a
strong
solution
of
vinegar
and
sulphur
,
which
he
had
always
in
readiness
in
the
chamber
,
and
when
thoroughly
saturated
,
laid
it
in
the
sun
to
dry
.
<EOS>
On
first
opening
the
shutter
to
answer
Leonard
's
summons
,
he
had
flashed
off
a
pistol
,
and
he
now
thought
to
expel
the
external
air
by
setting
fire
to
a
ball
composed
of
quick
brimstone
,
saltpetre
,
and
yellow
amber
,
which
being
placed
on
an
iron
plate
,
speedily
filled
the
room
with
a
thick
vapour
,
and
prevented
the
entrance
of
any
obnoxious
particles
.
<EOS>
These
precautions
taken
,
he
again
addressed
himself
,
while
the
packet
was
drying
,
to
Leonard
,
whom
he
found
gazing
anxiously
at
the
window
,
and
informed
him
that
all
his
family
had
hitherto
escaped
contagion
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
special
providence
must
have
watched
over
you
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
,
"
and
I
believe
yours
is
the
only
family
in
the
whole
city
that
has
been
so
spared
.
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
be
grateful
for
my
own
extraordinary
preservation
,
and
yet
I
would
rather
it
had
pleased
Heaven
to
take
me
away
than
leave
me
to
my
present
misery
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
keep
me
in
a
frightful
state
of
suspense
,
Leonard
,
"
rejoined
the
grocer
,
regarding
the
packet
wistfully
,
"
for
I
dare
not
open
your
letters
till
they
are
thoroughly
fumigated
.
<EOS>
You
assure
me
my
child
is
living
.
<EOS>
Has
she
been
attacked
by
the
plague
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Would
she
had
!
<EOS>
"
groaned
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
she
still
at
Ashdown
?
"
<EOS>
pursued
the
grocer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
shake
your
head
.
<EOS>
I
see!--I
must
be
beside
myself
not
to
have
thought
of
it
before
.
<EOS>
She
is
in
the
power
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
,
"
cried
Leonard
,
catching
at
the
angle
of
the
shed
for
support
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
here
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mr.
Bloundel
,
forgetting
his
caution
,
and
thrusting
himself
far
out
of
the
window
,
as
if
with
the
intention
of
letting
himself
down
by
the
rope--"I
am
here
,
when
I
ought
to
be
near
her
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Calm
yourself
,
<EOS>
I
beseech
you
,
sir
,
"
cried
Leonard
;
"
a
moment
's
rashness
will
undo
all
you
have
done
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
True
!
"
replied
the
grocer
,
checking
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
think
of
others
as
well
as
of
her
.
<EOS>
But
where
is
she
?
<EOS>
Hide
nothing
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
reason
to
believe
she
is
in
London
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
I
traced
her
hither
,
and
should
not
have
desisted
from
my
search
if
I
had
not
been
checked
by
the
plague
,
which
attacked
me
on
the
night
of
my
arrival
.
<EOS>
I
was
taken
to
the
pesthouse
near
Westbourne
Green
,
where
I
have
been
for
the
last
three
weeks
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
she
was
brought
to
London
,
as
you
state
,
"
rejoined
the
grocer
,
"
I
can
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
she
has
fallen
a
victim
to
the
scourge
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
moodily
,
"
and
I
would
almost
hope
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
When
you
peruse
my
letters
,
you
will
learn
that
she
was
carried
off
by
the
earl
from
the
residence
of
a
lady
at
Kingston
Lisle
,
whither
she
had
been
removed
for
safety
;
and
after
being
taken
from
place
to
place
,
was
at
last
conveyed
to
an
old
hall
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Oxford
,
where
she
was
concealed
for
nearly
a
month
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Answer
me
,
Leonard
,
"
cried
the
grocer
,
"
and
do
not
attempt
to
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
Has
she
preserved
her
honour
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Up
to
the
time
of
quitting
Oxford
she
had
preserved
it
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
.
"
<EOS>
She
herself
assured
me
she
had
resisted
all
the
earl
's
importunities
,
and
would
die
rather
than
yield
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
tell
you
how
I
obtained
an
interview
with
her
.
<EOS>
After
a
long
search
,
I
discovered
the
place
of
her
concealment
,
the
old
hall
I
have
just
mentioned
,
and
climbed
in
the
night
,
and
at
the
hazard
of
my
life
,
to
the
window
of
the
chamber
where
she
was
confined
.
<EOS>
I
saw
and
spoke
with
her
;
and
having
arranged
a
plan
by
which
I
hoped
to
accomplish
her
deliverance
on
the
following
night
,
descended
.
<EOS>
Whether
our
brief
conference
was
overheard
,
and
communicated
to
the
earl
,
I
know
not
;
but
it
would
seem
so
,
for
he
secretly
departed
with
her
the
next
morning
,
taking
the
road
,
as
I
subsequently
learnt
,
to
London
.
<EOS>
I
instantly
started
in
pursuit
,
and
had
reached
Paddington
,
when
I
fell
ill
,
as
I
have
related
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
you
tell
me
in
some
measure
eases
my
mind
,
"
replied
Mr.
Bloundel
,
after
a
pause
;
"
for
I
feel
that
my
daughter
,
if
alive
,
will
be
able
to
resist
her
persecutor
.
<EOS>
What
has
become
of
your
companions
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nizza
Macascree
has
met
with
the
same
fate
as
Amabel
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
unfortunate
enough
to
attract
the
king
's
attention
,
when
he
visited
Ashdown
Lodge
in
company
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
and
was
conveyed
to
Oxford
,
where
the
court
is
now
held
,
and
must
speedily
have
fallen
a
victim
to
her
royal
lover
if
she
had
not
disappeared
,
having
been
carried
off
,
it
was
supposed
,
by
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
But
the
villain
was
frustrated
in
his
infamous
design
.
<EOS>
The
king
's
suspicion
falling
upon
him
,
he
was
instantly
arrested
;
and
though
he
denied
all
knowledge
of
Nizza
's
retreat
,
and
was
afterwards
liberated
,
his
movements
were
so
strictly
watched
,
that
he
had
no
opportunity
of
visiting
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mention
Blaize
,
"
said
Mr.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
ill
,
I
trust
,
has
befallen
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
grieve
to
say
he
has
been
attacked
by
the
distemper
he
so
much
dreaded
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
He
accompanied
me
to
London
,
but
quitted
me
when
I
fell
sick
,
and
took
refuge
with
a
farmer
named
Wingfield
,
residing
near
Kensal
Green
.
<EOS>
I
accidentally
met
Wingfield
this
morning
,
and
he
informed
me
that
Blaize
was
taken
ill
the
day
before
yesterday
,
and
removed
to
the
pest
-
house
in
Finsbury
Fields
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
thither
presently
,
and
see
what
has
become
of
him
.
<EOS>
Is
Doctor
Hodges
still
among
the
living
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
so
,
"
replied
Mr.
Bloundel
,
"
though
I
have
not
seen
him
for
the
last
ten
days
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
disappeared
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
on
his
return
lowered
a
small
basket
containing
a
flask
of
canary
,
a
loaf
which
he
himself
had
baked
,
and
a
piece
of
cold
boiled
beef
.
<EOS>
The
apprentice
thankfully
received
the
provisions
,
and
retiring
to
the
hutch
,
began
to
discuss
them
,
fortifying
himself
with
a
copious
draught
of
canary
.
<EOS>
Having
concluded
his
repast
,
he
issued
forth
,
and
acquainting
Mr.
Bloundel
,
who
had
at
length
ventured
to
commence
reading
the
contents
of
the
packet
by
the
aid
of
powerful
glasses
,
that
he
was
about
to
proceed
to
Dr.
Hodges
's
residence
,
to
inquire
after
him
,
set
off
in
that
direction
.
 
<EOS>
Arrived
in
Great
Knightrider
-
street
,
he
was
greatly
shocked
at
finding
the
door
of
the
doctor
's
habitation
fastened
,
nor
could
he
make
any
one
hear
,
though
he
knocked
loudly
and
repeatedly
against
it
.
<EOS>
The
shutters
of
the
lower
windows
were
closed
,
and
the
place
looked
completely
deserted
.
<EOS>
All
the
adjoining
houses
were
shut
up
,
and
not
a
living
being
could
be
discerned
in
the
street
from
whom
information
could
be
obtained
relative
to
the
physician
.
<EOS>
Here
,
as
elsewhere
,
the
pavement
was
overgrown
with
grass
,
and
the
very
houses
had
a
strange
and
melancholy
look
,
as
if
sharing
in
the
general
desolation
.
<EOS>
On
looking
down
a
narrow
street
leading
to
the
river
,
Leonard
perceived
a
flock
of
poultry
scratching
among
the
staves
in
search
of
food
,
and
instinctively
calling
them
,
they
flew
towards
him
,
as
if
delighted
at
the
unwonted
sound
of
a
human
voice
.
<EOS>
These
,
and
a
half
-
starved
cat
,
were
the
only
things
living
that
he
could
perceive
.
<EOS>
At
the
further
end
of
the
street
he
caught
sight
of
the
river
,
speeding
in
its
course
towards
the
bridge
,
and
scarcely
knowing
whither
he
was
going
,
sauntered
to
its
edge
.
<EOS>
The
tide
had
just
turned
,
and
the
stream
was
sparkling
in
the
sunshine
,
but
no
craft
could
be
discovered
upon
its
bosom
;
and
except
a
few
barges
moored
to
its
sides
,
all
vestiges
of
the
numberless
vessels
with
which
it
was
once
crowded
were
gone
.
<EOS>
Its
quays
were
completely
deserted
.
<EOS>
Boxes
and
bales
of
goods
lay
untouched
on
the
wharves
;
the
cheering
cries
with
which
the
workmen
formerly
animated
their
labour
were
hushed
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
sound
of
creaking
cords
,
no
rattle
of
heavy
chains
--
none
of
the
busy
hum
ordinarily
attending
the
discharge
of
freight
from
a
vessel
,
or
the
packing
of
goods
and
stores
on
board
.
<EOS>
All
traffic
was
at
an
end
;
and
this
scene
,
usually
one
of
the
liveliest
possible
,
was
now
forlorn
and
desolate
.
<EOS>
On
the
opposite
shore
of
the
river
it
appeared
to
be
the
same
--
indeed
,
the
borough
of
Southwark
was
now
suffering
the
utmost
rigour
of
the
scourge
,
and
except
for
the
rows
of
houses
on
its
banks
,
and
the
noble
bridge
by
which
it
was
spanned
,
the
Thames
appeared
as
undisturbed
as
it
must
have
been
before
the
great
city
was
built
upon
its
banks
.
 
<EOS>
The
apprentice
viewed
this
scene
with
a
singular
kind
of
interest
.
<EOS>
He
had
become
so
accustomed
to
melancholy
sights
,
that
his
feelings
had
lost
their
acuteness
,
and
the
contemplation
of
the
deserted
buildings
and
neglected
wharves
around
him
harmonized
with
his
own
gloomy
thoughts
.
<EOS>
Pursuing
his
walk
along
the
side
of
the
river
,
he
was
checked
by
a
horrible
smell
,
and
looking
downward
,
he
perceived
a
carcass
in
the
last
stage
of
decomposition
lying
in
the
mud
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
washed
ashore
by
the
tide
,
and
a
large
bird
of
prey
was
contending
for
the
possession
of
it
with
a
legion
of
water
-
rats
.
<EOS>
Sickened
by
the
sight
,
he
turned
up
a
narrow
thoroughfare
near
Baynard
's
Castle
,
and
crossing
Thames
-
street
,
was
about
to
ascend
Addle
-
hill
,
when
he
perceived
a
man
wheeling
a
hand
-
barrow
,
containing
a
couple
of
corpses
,
in
the
direction
of
the
river
,
with
the
intention
,
doubtless
,
of
throwing
them
into
it
,
as
the
readiest
means
of
disposing
of
them
.
<EOS>
Both
bodies
were
stripped
of
their
clothing
,
and
the
blue
tint
of
the
nails
,
as
well
as
the
blotches
with
which
they
were
covered
,
left
no
doubt
as
to
the
disease
of
which
they
had
died
.
<EOS>
Averting
his
gaze
from
the
spectacle
,
Leonard
turned
off
on
the
right
along
Carter
-
lane
,
and
threading
a
short
passage
,
approached
the
southern
boundary
of
the
cathedral
;
and
proceeding
towards
the
great
door
opposite
him
,
passed
through
it
.
<EOS>
The
mighty
lazar
-
house
was
less
crowded
than
he
expected
to
find
it
,
but
its
terrible
condition
far
exceeded
his
worst
conceptions
.
<EOS>
Not
more
than
half
the
pallets
were
occupied
;
but
as
the
sick
were
in
a
great
measure
left
to
themselves
,
the
utmost
disorder
prevailed
.
<EOS>
A
troop
of
lazars
,
with
sheets
folded
around
them
,
glided
,
like
phantoms
,
along
Paul
's
Walk
,
and
mimicked
in
a
ghastly
manner
the
air
and
deportment
of
the
gallants
who
had
formerly
thronged
the
place
.
<EOS>
No
attempt
being
made
to
maintain
silence
,
the
noise
was
perfectly
stunning
;
some
of
the
sick
were
shrieking
--
<EOS>
some
laughing
in
a
wild
unearthly
manner
--
<EOS>
some
praying
--
some
uttering
loud
execrations
--
others
groaning
and
lamenting
.
<EOS>
The
holy
building
seemed
to
have
become
the
abode
of
evil
and
tormented
spirits
.
<EOS>
Many
dead
were
lying
in
the
beds
--
the
few
attendants
who
were
present
not
caring
to
remove
them
;
and
Leonard
had
little
doubt
,
that
before
another
sun
went
down
the
whole
of
the
ghastly
assemblage
before
him
would
share
their
fate
.
<EOS>
If
the
habitations
he
had
recently
gazed
upon
had
appeared
plague
-
stricken
,
the
sacred
structure
in
which
he
was
now
standing
seemed
yet
more
horribly
contaminated
.
<EOS>
Ill
-
kept
and
ill
-
ventilated
,
the
air
was
loaded
with
noxious
effluvia
,
while
the
various
abominations
that
met
the
eye
at
every
turn
would
have
been
sufficient
to
produce
the
distemper
in
any
one
who
had
come
in
contact
with
them
.
<EOS>
They
were
,
however
,
utterly
disregarded
by
the
miserable
sufferers
and
their
attendants
.
<EOS>
The
magnificent
painted
windows
were
dimmed
by
a
thick
clammy
steam
,
which
could
scarcely
be
washed
off
--
while
the
carved
oak
screens
,
the
sculptured
tombs
,
the
pillars
,
the
walls
,
and
the
flagged
floors
were
covered
with
impurities
.
 
<EOS>
Satisfied
with
a
brief
survey
of
this
frightful
scene
,
Leonard
turned
to
depart
,
and
was
passing
the
entrance
to
Saint
Faith
's
,
which
stood
open
,
when
he
caught
sight
of
Judith
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
broad
stone
steps
,
and
holding
a
lamp
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
was
conversing
with
a
tall
richly
-
dressed
man
,
whose
features
he
fancied
he
had
seen
before
,
though
he
could
not
at
the
moment
call
them
to
mind
.
<EOS>
After
a
brief
conversation
,
they
moved
off
into
the
depths
of
the
vault
,
and
he
lost
eight
of
them
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
it
occurred
to
Leonard
that
Judith
's
companion
was
the
unfortunate
stranger
whose
child
he
had
interred
,
and
who
had
been
so
strangely
affected
at
the
sight
of
Nizza
Macascree
.
<EOS>
Determined
to
ascertain
the
point
,
he
hurried
down
the
steps
and
plunged
into
the
vault
.
<EOS>
It
was
buried
in
profound
darkness
,
and
he
had
not
proceeded
far
when
he
stumbled
over
something
lying
in
his
path
,
and
found
from
the
groan
that
followed
that
it
was
a
plague
-
patient
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
regain
his
feet
,
the
unfortunate
sufferer
whom
he
had
thus
disturbed
implored
him
,
in
piteous
accents
,
which
,
with
a
shudder
,
he
recognised
as
those
of
Blaize
,
to
remove
him
.
<EOS>
Leonard
immediately
gave
the
poor
porter
to
understand
that
he
was
near
him
,
and
would
render
him
every
aid
in
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
assistance
comes
too
late
,
Leonard
,
"
groaned
<EOS>
Blaize--"it
's
all
over
with
me
now
,
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
like
to
breathe
my
last
in
this
dismal
vault
,
without
medicine
or
food
,
both
of
which
I
am
denied
by
that
infernal
hag
Mother
Malmayns
,
who
calls
herself
a
nurse
,
but
who
is
in
reality
a
robber
and
murderess
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
the
frightful
scenes
I
have
witnessed
since
I
have
been
brought
here
!
<EOS>
I
told
you
I
should
not
escape
the
plague
.
<EOS>
I
shall
die
of
it
<EOS>
--
I
am
sure
I
shall
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
were
at
the
pest
-
house
in
Finsbury
Fields
,
"
said
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
taken
there
,
"
replied
Blaize
;
"
but
the
place
was
full
,
and
they
would
not
admit
me
,
so
I
was
sent
to
Saint
Paul
's
,
where
there
was
plenty
of
room
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
I
did
pretty
well
,
for
I
was
in
the
great
ward
above
,
and
one
of
the
attendants
obeyed
my
directions
implicitly
,
and
I
am
certain
<EOS>
if
they
had
been
fully
carried
out
,
I
should
have
got
well
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
what
I
did
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
was
placed
on
a
pallet
,
and
covered
with
blankets
,
I
ordered
a
drink
to
be
prepared
of
the
inner
bark
of
an
ash
-
tree
,
green
walnuts
,
scabious
vervain
,
and
saffron
,
boiled
in
two
quarts
of
the
strongest
vinegar
.
<EOS>
Of
this
mixture
I
drank
plentifully
,
and
it
soon
produced
a
plentiful
perspiration
.
<EOS>
I
next
had
a
hen
--
a
live
one
,
of
course
--
stripped
of
the
feathers
,
and
brought
to
me
.
<EOS>
Its
bill
was
held
to
the
large
blotch
under
my
arm
,
and
kept
there
till
the
fowl
died
from
the
noxious
matter
it
drew
forth
.
<EOS>
I
next
repeated
the
experiment
with
a
pigeon
,
and
derived
the
greatest
benefit
from
it
.
<EOS>
The
tumour
had
nearly
subsided
,
and
if
I
had
been
properly
treated
afterwards
,
I
should
now
be
in
a
fair
way
of
recovery
.
<EOS>
But
instead
of
nice
strengthening
chicken
-
broth
,
flavoured
with
succory
and
marigolds
;
or
water
-
gruel
,
mixed
with
rosemary
and
winter
-
savory
;
or
a
panado
,
seasoned
with
verjuice
or
wood
-
sorrel
;
instead
of
swallowing
large
draughts
of
warm
beer
;
or
water
boiled
with
carduus
seeds
;
or
a
posset
drink
,
made
with
sorrel
,
bugloss
,
and
borage;--instead
of
these
remedies
,
or
any
other
,
I
was
carried
to
this
horrible
place
when
I
was
asleep
,
and
strapped
to
my
pallet
,
as
you
perceive
.
<EOS>
Unloose
me
,
if
you
can
do
nothing
else
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
will
readily
do
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
"
but
I
must
first
procure
a
light
.
<EOS>
"
With
this
,
he
groped
his
way
among
the
close
ranks
of
ponderous
pillars
,
but
though
he
proceeded
with
the
utmost
caution
,
he
could
not
avoid
coming
in
contact
with
the
beds
of
some
of
the
other
patients
,
and
disturbing
them
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
descried
a
glimmer
of
light
issuing
from
a
door
which
he
knew
to
be
that
of
the
vestry
,
and
which
was
standing
slightly
ajar
.
<EOS>
Opening
it
,
he
perceived
a
lamp
burning
on
the
table
,
and
without
stopping
to
look
around
him
,
seized
it
,
and
hurried
back
to
the
porter
.
<EOS>
Poor
Blaize
presented
a
lamentable
,
and
yet
grotesque
appearance
.
<EOS>
His
plump
person
was
greatly
reduced
in
bulk
,
and
his
round
cheeks
had
become
hollow
and
cadaverous
.
<EOS>
He
was
strapped
,
as
he
had
stated
,
to
the
pallet
,
which
in
its
turn
was
fastened
to
the
adjoining
pillar
.
<EOS>
A
blanket
was
tightly
swathed
around
him
,
and
a
large
cloth
was
bound
round
his
head
in
lieu
of
a
nightcap
.
<EOS>
Leonard
instantly
set
about
releasing
him
,
and
had
just
unfastened
the
straps
when
he
heard
footsteps
approaching
,
and
looking
up
,
perceived
the
stranger
and
Judith
Malmayns
advancing
towards
him
.

THE
SECOND
PLAGUE
-
PIT
.
 
<EOS>
Judith
,
being
a
little
in
advance
of
her
companion
,
took
Leonard
in
the
first
instance
for
a
chirurgeon
's
assistant
,
and
called
to
him
,
in
a
harsh
and
menacing
voice
,
to
let
her
charge
alone
.
<EOS>
On
drawing
near
,
however
,
she
perceived
her
mistake
,
and
recognising
the
apprentice
,
halted
with
a
disconcerted
look
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
stranger
had
come
up
,
and
remarking
her
embarrassment
,
inquired
the
cause
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
there
,
"
cried
Judith
,
pointing
towards
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yonder
stands
the
very
man
you
seek
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
Leonard
Holt
,
"
cried
the
other
,
in
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
Leonard
Holt
,
"
rejoined
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
now
put
any
questions
to
him
you
think
proper
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
did
not
require
the
suggestion
to
be
repeated
,
but
instantly
hastened
to
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
Leonard
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"
I
owe
you
a
large
debt
of
obligation
,
"
continued
the
stranger
,
"
and
you
shall
not
find
me
slow
in
paying
it
.
<EOS>
But
let
it
pass
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
aught
of
Nizza
Macascree
?
<EOS>
I
know
she
was
taken
to
Oxford
by
the
king
,
and
subsequently
disappeared
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
know
as
much
as
I
do
of
her
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
right
,
you
see
,
Mr.
Thirlby
,
"
interposed
Judith
,
with
a
malicious
grin
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
this
youth
would
be
utterly
ignorant
of
her
retreat
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
firm
conviction
is
,
that
she
is
in
the
power
of
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
,
"
observed
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
But
it
is
impossible
to
say
where
she
is
concealed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
my
last
hope
of
finding
her
has
fallen
to
the
ground
,
"
replied
Thirlby
,
with
a
look
of
great
distress
.
<EOS>
"
Ever
since
my
recovery
from
the
plague
,
I
have
been
in
search
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
traced
her
from
Ashdown
Park
to
Oxford
,
but
she
was
gone
before
my
arrival
at
the
latter
place
;
and
though
I
made
every
possible
inquiry
after
her
,
and
kept
strict
and
secret
watch
upon
the
villain
whom
I
suspected
,
as
you
do
,
of
carrying
her
off
,
I
could
gain
no
clue
to
her
retreat
.
<EOS>
Having
ascertained
,
however
,
that
you
were
seen
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Oxford
about
the
time
of
her
disappearance
,
I
had
persuaded
myself
you
must
have
aided
her
escape
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
groan
,
"
I
find
I
was
mistaken
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
were
so
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
mournfully
;
"
I
was
in
search
of
my
master
's
daughter
,
Amabel
,
who
was
carried
off
at
the
same
time
by
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
and
my
anxiety
about
her
made
me
neglectful
of
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
ignorant
of
your
devoted
attachment
to
her
,
"
remarked
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
never
find
Amabel
again
,
"
observed
Judith
,
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
mean
you
woman
?
"
asked
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
what
I
say
,
"
rejoined
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
,
you
will
never
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
speak
thus
positively
without
some
motive
,
"
returned
Leonard
,
seizing
her
arm
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
she
?
<EOS>
What
has
happened
to
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
you
shall
never
learn
from
me
,
"
returned
Judith
,
with
a
triumphant
glance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
,
or
I
will
force
you
to
do
so
,
"
cried
Leonard
,
furiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Force
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Judith
,
laughing
derisively
;
"
you
know
not
whom
you
threaten
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
_
I
_
do
,
"
interposed
Thirlby
.
"
<EOS>
This
young
man
_
shall
_
have
an
answer
to
this
question
,
"
he
continued
,
addressing
her
in
an
authoritative
tone
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
anything
of
the
girl
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Judith
;
"
I
was
merely
jesting
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shame
on
you
,
to
trifle
with
his
feelings
thus
,
"
rejoined
Thirlby
.
<EOS>
"
Step
with
me
this
way
,
young
man
,
I
wish
to
speak
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
leave
me
here
,
Leonard
,
"
cried
Blaize
,
"
or
I
shall
die
before
you
come
back
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
intention
of
leaving
you
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
aware
whether
Doctor
Hodges
is
still
alive
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
to
Thirlby
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
been
to
his
residence
in
Great
Knight
-
rider
-
street
,
and
found
it
shut
up
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
removed
to
Watling
-
street
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
but
I
have
not
seen
him
since
my
return
to
London
.
<EOS>
If
you
wish
it
,
I
will
go
to
his
house
at
once
,
and
send
him
to
look
after
your
poor
friend
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
was
about
to
return
thanks
for
the
offer
,
when
the
design
was
frustrated
by
Blaize
himself
,
who
was
so
terrified
by
Judith
's
looks
,
that
he
could
pay
no
attention
to
what
was
going
forward
;
and
fearing
,
notwithstanding
Leonard
's
assurance
to
the
contrary
,
that
he
should
be
left
behind
,
he
started
to
his
feet
,
and
wrapping
the
blanket
about
him
,
ran
up
the
steps
leading
to
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
Leonard
and
Thirlby
followed
,
and
seeing
him
dart
into
the
southern
aisle
,
would
have
pursued
him
along
it
,
but
were
afraid
of
coming
in
contact
with
the
many
sick
persons
by
whom
it
was
thronged
.
<EOS>
They
contented
themselves
,
therefore
,
with
watching
his
course
,
and
were
not
a
little
surprised
and
alarmed
to
find
the
whole
troop
of
lazars
set
off
after
him
,
making
the
sacred
walls
ring
with
their
cries
.
<EOS>
Frightened
by
the
clamour
,
Blaize
redoubled
his
speed
,
and
,
with
this
ghastly
train
at
his
heels
,
crossed
the
lower
part
of
the
mid
-
aisle
,
and
darting
through
the
pillars
,
took
refuge
within
Bishop
Kempe
's
Chapel
,
the
door
of
which
stood
open
,
and
which
he
instantly
closed
after
him
.
<EOS>
Judith
,
who
had
followed
the
party
from
the
subterranean
church
,
laughed
heartily
at
the
chase
of
the
poor
porter
,
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
regret
at
its
sudden
conclusion
.
<EOS>
Leonard
,
however
,
being
apprehensive
of
mischief
from
the
crowd
of
sick
persons
collected
before
the
door
,
some
of
whom
were
knocking
against
it
and
trying
to
force
it
open
,
addressed
himself
to
a
couple
of
the
attendants
,
and
prevailed
on
them
to
accompany
him
to
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
The
assemblage
was
speedily
dispersed
,
and
Blaize
hearing
Leonard
's
voice
,
instantly
opened
the
door
and
admitted
him
;
and
,
as
soon
as
his
fears
were
allayed
,
he
was
placed
on
a
pallet
within
the
chapel
,
and
wrapped
up
in
blankets
,
while
such
remedies
as
were
deemed
proper
were
administered
to
him
.
<EOS>
Committing
him
to
the
care
of
the
attendants
,
and
promising
to
reward
them
well
for
their
trouble
,
Leonard
told
Blaize
he
should
go
and
bring
Doctor
Hodges
to
him
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
departed
,
and
finding
Thirlby
waiting
for
him
at
the
south
door
,
they
went
forth
together
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
almost
afraid
of
leaving
the
poor
fellow
,
"
said
Leonard
,
hesitating
as
he
was
about
to
descends
the
steps
.
"
<EOS>
Judith
Malmayns
is
so
cunning
and
unscrupulous
,
that
she
may
find
some
means
of
doing
him
an
injury
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
no
fear
,
"
replied
Thirlby
;
"
she
has
promised
me
not
to
molest
him
further
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
appear
to
have
a
strange
influence
over
her
,
then
,
"
observed
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
how
you
have
attained
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
matter
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
suffice
that
I
am
willing
to
exercise
it
in
your
behalf
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
not
disposed
to
tell
me
the
nature
of
the
interest
you
feel
in
Nizza
Macascree
?
"
pursued
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
as
yet
,
"
replied
Thirlby
,
with
a
look
and
tone
calculated
to
put
a
stop
to
further
inquiries
.
 
<EOS>
Passing
through
Saint
Austin
's
Gate
,
they
approached
Watling
-
street
,
at
the
corner
of
which
stood
the
house
where
Doctor
Hodges
had
taken
up
his
temporary
abode
,
that
he
might
visit
the
sick
in
the
cathedral
with
greater
convenience
,
and
be
more
readily
summoned
whenever
his
attendance
might
be
required
.
<EOS>
Thirlby
's
knock
at
the
door
was
answered
,
to
Leonard
's
great
satisfaction
,
by
the
old
porter
,
who
was
equally
delighted
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
did
not
escape
Leonard
that
the
porter
treated
the
stranger
with
great
respect
,
and
he
inferred
from
this
that
he
was
a
person
of
some
consideration
,
as
indeed
his
deportment
bespoke
him
.
<EOS>
The
old
man
informed
them
that
his
master
had
been
summoned
on
a
case
of
urgency
early
in
the
morning
,
and
had
not
yet
returned
,
neither
was
he
aware
whither
he
was
gone
.
<EOS>
He
promised
,
however
,
to
acquaint
him
with
Blaize
's
condition
immediately
on
his
return--"and
<EOS>
I
need
not
assure
you
,
"
he
added
to
Leonard
,
"
that
he
will
instantly
go
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
Thirlby
then
inquired
of
the
porter
whether
Mike
Macascree
,
the
blind
piper
,
was
still
at
Dame
Lucas
's
cottage
,
in
Finsbury
Fields
,
and
was
answered
in
the
affirmative
by
the
old
man
,
who
added
,
however
,
in
a
voice
of
much
emotion
,
that
the
good
dame
herself
was
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
died
about
a
fortnight
ago
of
the
plague
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
is
buried
where
she
desired
to
be
,
beneath
an
old
apple
-
tree
in
her
garden
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
"
exclaimed
Leonard
,
brushing
away
a
tear
,
"
her
own
foreboding
is
too
truly
realised
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
about
to
visit
the
old
piper
,
"
observed
Thirlby
to
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will
you
go
with
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
other
readily
acquiesced
,
only
stipulating
that
they
should
call
in
Wood
-
street
on
the
way
,
that
he
might
inquire
whether
his
master
wanted
him
.
<EOS>
Thirlby
agreeing
to
this
,
and
the
old
porter
repeating
his
assurance
that
Leonard
might
make
himself
quite
easy
as
to
Blaize
,
for
he
would
send
his
master
to
him
the
instant
he
returned
,
they
set
out
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
Wood
-
street
the
apprentice
gave
the
customary
signal
,
and
the
grocer
answering
it
,
he
informed
him
of
his
unexpected
meeting
with
Blaize
,
and
of
the
state
in
which
he
had
left
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
was
much
distressed
by
the
intelligence
,
and
telling
Leonard
that
he
should
not
require
him
again
that
night
,
besought
him
to
observe
the
utmost
caution
.
<EOS>
This
the
apprentice
promised
,
and
joining
Thirlby
,
who
had
walked
forward
to
a
little
distance
,
they
struck
into
a
narrow
street
on
the
right
,
and
proceeding
along
Aldermanbury
,
soon
arrived
at
the
first
postern
in
the
city
walls
beyond
Cripplegate
.
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
Thirlby
had
maintained
a
profound
silence
,
and
appeared
lost
in
melancholy
reflection
.
<EOS>
Except
now
and
then
casting
a
commiserating
glance
at
the
wretched
objects
they
encountered
on
the
road
,
he
kept
his
eyes
steadily
fixed
upon
the
ground
,
and
walked
at
a
brisky
pace
,
as
if
desirous
of
getting
out
of
the
city
as
quickly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
his
weakness
,
Leonard
managed
to
keep
up
with
him
,
and
his
curiosity
being
greatly
aroused
by
what
had
just
occurred
,
he
began
to
study
his
appearance
and
features
attentively
.
<EOS>
Thirlby
was
full
six
feet
in
height
,
and
possessed
a
powerful
and
well
-
proportioned
figure
,
and
would
have
been
considered
extremely
handsome
but
for
a
certain
sinister
expression
about
the
eyes
,
which
were
large
and
dark
,
but
lighted
by
a
fierce
and
peculiar
fire
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
was
dark
,
and
his
countenance
still
bore
the
impress
of
the
dreadful
disease
from
which
he
had
recently
recovered
.
<EOS>
A
gloomy
shade
sat
about
his
brow
,
and
it
seemed
to
Leonard
as
if
he
had
been
led
by
his
passions
into
the
commission
of
crimes
of
which
he
had
afterwards
bitterly
repented
.
<EOS>
His
deportment
was
proud
and
commanding
,
and
though
he
exhibited
no
haughtiness
towards
the
apprentice
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
treated
him
with
great
familiarity
,
it
was
plain
<EOS>
he
did
so
merely
from
a
sense
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
His
age
was
under
forty
,
and
his
habiliments
were
rich
,
though
of
a
sombre
colour
.
 
<EOS>
Passing
through
the
postern
,
which
stood
wide
open
,
the
watchman
having
disappeared
,
they
entered
a
narrow
lane
,
skirted
by
a
few
detached
houses
,
all
of
which
were
shut
up
,
and
marked
by
the
fatal
cross
.
<EOS>
As
they
passed
one
of
these
habitations
,
they
were
arrested
by
loud
and
continued
shrieks
of
the
most
heart
-
rending
nature
,
and
questioning
a
watchman
who
stood
at
an
adjoining
door
,
as
to
the
cause
of
them
,
he
said
they
proceeded
from
a
poor
lady
who
had
just
lost
the
last
of
her
family
by
the
plague
.
 
<EOS>
"
Her
husband
and
all
her
children
,
except
one
daughter
,
died
last
week
,
"
said
the
man
,
"
and
though
she
seemed
deeply
afflicted
,
yet
she
bore
her
loss
with
resignation
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
,
her
daughter
was
taken
ill
,
and
she
died
about
two
hours
ago
,
since
when
the
poor
mother
has
done
nothing
but
shriek
in
the
way
you
hear
.
<EOS>
Poor
soul
!
<EOS>
she
will
die
of
grief
,
as
many
have
done
before
her
at
this
awful
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Something
must
be
done
to
pacify
her
,
"
returned
Thirlby
,
in
a
voice
of
much
emotion,--"she
must
be
removed
from
her
child
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
can
she
be
removed
to
?
"
rejoined
the
watchman
.
<EOS>
"
Who
will
receive
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
we
can
remove
the
object
that
occasions
her
affliction
,
"
rejoined
Thirlby
.
<EOS>
"
My
heart
bleeds
for
her
.
<EOS>
I
never
heard
shrieks
so
dreadful
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
dead
-
cart
will
pass
by
in
an
hour
,
"
said
the
watchman
;
"
and
then
the
body
can
be
taken
away
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
An
hour
will
be
too
late
,
"
rejoined
Thirlby
.
<EOS>
"
If
she
continues
in
this
frantic
state
,
she
will
be
dead
before
that
time
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
hand
-
barrow
there
.
<EOS>
Take
the
body
to
the
plague
-
pit
at
once
,
and
I
will
reward
you
for
your
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
find
some
difficulty
in
getting
into
the
house
,
"
said
the
watchman
,
who
evidently
felt
some
repugnance
to
the
task
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
,
"
replied
Thirlby
.
<EOS>
And
pushing
forcibly
against
the
door
,
he
burst
it
open
,
and
,
directed
by
the
cries
,
entered
a
room
on
the
right
.
<EOS>
The
watchman
's
statement
proved
correct
.
<EOS>
Stretched
upon
a
bed
in
one
corner
lay
the
body
of
a
beautiful
girl
,
while
the
poor
mother
was
bending
over
it
in
a
state
bordering
on
distraction
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
Thirlby
,
she
fled
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
,
but
did
not
desist
from
her
cries
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
she
was
unable
to
do
so
,
being
under
the
dominion
of
the
wildest
hysterical
passion
.
<EOS>
In
vain
Thirlby
endeavoured
to
make
her
comprehend
by
signs
the
nature
of
his
errand
.
<EOS>
Waving
him
off
,
she
continued
shrieking
more
loudly
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Half
-
stunned
by
the
cries
,
and
greatly
agitated
by
the
sight
of
the
child
,
whose
appearance
reminded
him
of
his
own
daughter
,
Thirlby
motioned
the
watchman
,
who
had
followed
him
into
the
room
,
to
bring
away
the
body
,
and
rushed
forth
.
<EOS>
His
injunctions
were
obeyed
.
<EOS>
The
remains
of
the
unfortunate
girl
were
wrapped
in
a
sheet
,
and
deposited
in
the
hand
-
barrow
.
<EOS>
The
miserable
mother
followed
the
watchman
to
the
door
,
but
did
not
attempt
to
interfere
with
him
,
and
having
seen
the
body
of
her
child
disposed
of
in
the
manner
above
described
,
turned
back
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
,
a
heavy
sound
proclaimed
that
she
had
fallen
to
the
ground
,
and
her
shrieks
were
hushed
.
<EOS>
Thirlby
and
Leonard
exchanged
sad
and
significant
looks
,
but
neither
of
them
went
back
to
see
what
had
happened
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
watchman
shook
his
head
,
and
setting
the
barrow
in
motion
,
proceeded
along
a
narrow
footpath
across
the
fields
.
<EOS>
Remarking
that
he
did
not
take
the
direct
road
to
the
plague
-
pit
,
Leonard
called
to
him
,
and
pointed
out
the
corner
in
which
it
lay
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
where
the
old
plague
-
pit
is
,
as
well
as
you
,
"
replied
the
watchman
,
"
but
it
has
been
filled
these
three
weeks
.
<EOS>
The
new
pit
lies
in
this
direction
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
pursued
his
course
,
and
they
presently
entered
a
field
,
in
the
middle
of
which
lay
the
plague
-
pit
,
as
was
evident
from
the
immense
mound
of
clay
thrown
out
of
the
excavation
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
pit
is
neither
so
deep
nor
so
wide
as
the
old
one
,
"
said
the
watchman
,
"
and
if
the
plague
goes
on
at
this
rate
,
they
will
soon
have
to
dig
another
--
that
is
,
if
any
one
should
be
left
alive
to
undertake
the
job
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
chuckling
as
if
he
had
said
a
good
thing
,
he
impelled
his
barrow
forward
more
quickly
.
<EOS>
A
few
seconds
brought
them
near
the
horrible
chasm
.
<EOS>
It
was
more
than
half
full
,
and
in
all
respects
resembled
the
other
pit
,
except
that
it
was
somewhat
smaller
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
same
heaving
and
putrefying
mass,--the
same
ghastly
objects
of
every
kind,--the
grey
-
headed
old
man
,
the
dark
-
haired
maiden
,
the
tender
infant,--all
huddled
together
.
<EOS>
Wheeling
the
barrow
to
the
edge
of
the
pit
,
the
watchman
cast
his
load
into
it
;
and
without
even
tarrying
to
throw
a
handful
of
soil
over
it
,
turned
back
,
and
rejoined
Thirlby
,
who
had
halted
at
some
distance
from
the
excavation
.
<EOS>
While
the
latter
was
searching
for
his
purse
to
reward
the
watchman
,
they
heard
wild
shrieks
in
the
adjoining
field
,
and
the
next
moment
perceived
the
wretched
mother
running
towards
them
.
<EOS>
Guessing
her
purpose
from
his
former
experience
,
Leonard
called
to
the
others
to
stop
her
,
and
stretching
out
his
arms
,
placed
himself
in
her
path
.
<EOS>
But
all
their
efforts
were
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
darted
past
them
,
and
though
Leonard
caught
hold
of
her
,
she
broke
from
him
,
and
leaving
a
fragment
of
her
dress
in
his
grasp
,
flung
herself
into
the
chasm
.
 
<EOS>
Well
knowing
that
all
help
was
vain
,
Thirlby
placed
a
few
pieces
of
money
in
the
watchman
's
hand
,
and
hurried
away
.
<EOS>
He
was
followed
by
Leonard
,
who
was
equally
eager
to
quit
the
spot
.
<EOS>
It
so
chanced
that
the
path
they
had
taken
led
them
near
the
site
of
the
old
plague
-
pit
,
and
Leonard
pointed
it
out
to
his
companion
.
<EOS>
The
latter
stopped
for
a
moment
,
and
then
,
without
saying
a
word
,
ran
quickly
towards
it
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
spot
,
they
found
that
the
pit
was
completely
filled
up
.
<EOS>
The
vast
cake
of
clay
with
which
it
was
covered
had
swollen
and
cracked
in
an
extraordinary
manner
,
and
emitted
such
a
horrible
effluvium
that
they
both
instantly
retreated
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
that
is
the
grave
of
my
poor
child
,
"
cried
Thirlby
,
halting
,
and
bursting
into
a
passionate
flood
of
tears
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
been
a
fitting
resting
-
place
for
a
guilty
wretch
like
me
;
but
for
her
it
is
horrible
.
"
 
<EOS>
Allowing
time
for
the
violence
of
his
grief
to
subside
,
Leonard
addressed
a
few
words
of
consolation
to
him
,
and
then
tried
to
turn
the
current
of
his
thoughts
by
introducing
a
different
subject
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
he
proceeded
to
detail
the
piper
's
mysterious
conduct
as
to
the
packet
,
and
concluded
by
mentioning
the
piece
of
gold
which
Nizza
wore
as
an
amulet
,
and
which
she
fancied
must
have
some
connection
with
her
early
history
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
of
the
packet
and
amulet
from
Doctor
Hodges
,
"
said
Thirlby
,
"
and
should
have
visited
the
piper
on
my
recovery
from
the
plague
,
but
I
was
all
impatience
to
behold
Nizza
,
and
could
not
brook
an
instant
's
delay
.
<EOS>
But
you
know
his
cottage
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
be
far
from
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yonder
<EOS>
it
is
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
pointing
to
the
little
habitation
,
which
lay
at
a
field
's
distance
from
them--"and
<EOS>
we
are
certain
to
meet
with
him
,
for
I
hear
the
notes
of
his
pipe
.
"
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
deceived
,
for
as
they
crossed
the
field
,
and
approached
the
cottage
,
<EOS>
the
sounds
of
a
melancholy
air
played
on
the
pipe
became
each
instant
more
distinct
.
<EOS>
Before
entering
the
gate
,
they
paused
for
a
moment
to
listen
to
the
music
,
and
Leonard
could
not
help
contrasting
the
present
neglected
appearance
of
the
garden
with
the
neatness
it
exhibited
when
he
last
saw
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
overgrown
with
weeds
,
while
the
drooping
flowers
seemed
to
bemoan
the
loss
of
their
mistress
.
<EOS>
Leonard
's
gaze
involuntarily
wandered
in
search
of
the
old
apple
-
tree
,
and
he
presently
discovered
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
loaded
with
fruit
,
and
the
rounded
sod
beneath
it
proclaimed
the
grave
of
the
ill
-
fated
Dame
Lucas
.
 
<EOS>
Satisfied
with
this
survey
,
Leonard
opened
the
gate
,
but
had
no
sooner
set
foot
in
the
garden
than
the
loud
barking
of
a
dog
was
heard
,
and
Bell
rushed
forth
.
<EOS>
Leonard
instantly
called
to
her
,
and
on
hearing
his
voice
,
the
little
animal
instantly
changed
her
angry
tones
to
a
gladsome
whine
,
and
,
skipping
towards
him
,
fawned
at
his
feet
.
<EOS>
While
he
stooped
to
caress
her
,
the
piper
,
who
had
been
alarmed
by
the
barking
,
appeared
at
the
door
,
and
called
out
to
know
who
was
there
?
<EOS>
At
the
sight
of
him
,
Thirlby
,
who
was
close
behind
Leonard
,
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
,
and
exclaiming
,
"
It
is
he
!
"
<EOS>
rushed
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
cry
of
recognition
uttered
by
the
stranger
caused
the
piper
to
start
as
if
he
had
received
a
sudden
and
violent
shock
.
<EOS>
The
ruddy
tint
instantly
deserted
his
cheek
,
and
was
succeeded
by
a
deadly
paleness
;
his
limbs
trembled
,
and
he
bent
forward
with
a
countenance
of
the
utmost
anxiety
,
as
if
awaiting
a
confirmation
of
his
fears
.
<EOS>
When
within
a
couple
of
yards
of
him
,
Thirlby
paused
,
and
having
narrowly
scrutinized
his
features
,
as
if
to
satisfy
himself
he
was
not
mistaken
,
again
exclaimed
,
though
in
a
lower
and
deeper
tone
than
before
,
"
It
is
he
!
"
<EOS>
and
seizing
his
arm
,
pushed
him
into
the
house
,
banging
the
door
to
after
him
in
such
a
manner
as
to
leave
no
doubt
in
the
apprentice
's
mind
that
his
presence
was
not
desired
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
though
extremely
anxious
to
hear
what
passed
between
them
,
certain
their
conversation
must
relate
to
Nizza
Macascree
,
Leonard
did
not
attempt
to
follow
,
but
,
accompanied
by
Bell
,
who
continued
to
gambol
round
him
,
directed
his
steps
towards
the
grave
of
Dame
Lucas
.
<EOS>
Here
he
endeavoured
to
beguile
the
time
in
meditation
,
but
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
turn
his
thoughts
into
a
different
channel
,
they
perpetually
recurred
to
what
he
supposed
to
be
taking
place
inside
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
extraordinary
effect
produced
by
Nizza
Macascree
on
Thirlby
--
the
resemblance
he
had
discovered
between
her
and
some
person
dear
to
him
--
the
anxiety
he
appeared
to
feel
for
her
,
as
evinced
by
his
recent
search
for
her
--
the
mysterious
connection
which
clearly
subsisted
between
him
and
the
piper
--
all
these
circumstances
convinced
Leonard
that
Thirlby
was
,
or
imagined
himself
,
connected
by
ties
of
the
closest
relationship
with
the
supposed
piper
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Leonard
had
never
been
able
to
discern
the
slightest
resemblance
either
in
manner
or
feature
,
or
in
those
indescribably
slight
personal
peculiarities
that
constitute
a
family
likeness
,
between
Nizza
and
her
reputed
father
--
neither
could
he
now
recall
any
particular
resemblance
between
her
and
Thirlby
;
still
he
could
not
help
thinking
her
beauty
and
high
-
bred
<EOS>
looks
savoured
more
of
the
latter
than
the
former
.
<EOS>
He
came
,
therefore
,
to
the
conclusion
that
she
must
be
the
offspring
of
some
early
and
unfortunate
attachment
on
the
part
of
Thirlby
,
whose
remorse
might
naturally
be
the
consequence
of
his
culpable
conduct
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
His
sole
perplexity
was
the
piper
's
connection
with
the
affair
;
but
he
got
over
this
difficulty
by
supposing
that
Nizza
's
mother
,
whoever
she
was
,
must
have
committed
her
to
Macascree
's
care
when
an
infant
,
probably
with
strict
injunctions
,
which
circumstances
might
render
necessary
,
to
conceal
her
even
from
her
father
.
<EOS>
Such
was
Leonard
's
solution
of
the
mystery
;
and
feeling
convinced
that
he
had
made
himself
master
of
the
stranger
's
secret
,
he
resolved
to
give
him
to
understand
as
much
as
soon
as
he
beheld
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
half
an
hour
having
elapsed
,
and
Thirlby
not
coming
forth
,
Leonard
began
to
think
sufficient
time
had
been
allowed
him
for
private
conference
with
the
piper
,
and
he
therefore
walked
towards
the
door
,
and
coughing
to
announce
his
approach
,
raised
the
latch
and
entered
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
found
the
pair
seated
close
together
,
and
conversing
in
a
low
and
earnest
tone
.
<EOS>
The
piper
had
completely
recovered
from
his
alarm
,
and
seemed
perfectly
at
ease
with
his
companion
,
while
all
traces
of
anger
had
disappeared
from
the
countenance
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
Before
them
on
the
table
lay
several
letters
,
taken
from
a
packet
,
the
cover
of
which
Leonard
recognised
as
the
one
that
had
been
formerly
intrusted
to
him
.
<EOS>
Amidst
them
was
the
miniature
of
a
lady
--
at
least
,
it
appeared
so
to
Leonard
,
in
the
hasty
glance
he
caught
of
it
;
but
he
could
not
be
quite
sure
;
for
on
seeing
him
,
Thirlby
closed
the
case
,
and
placing
his
hand
on
the
piper
's
mouth
,
to
check
his
further
speech
,
arose
.
 
<EOS>
"
Forgive
my
rudeness
,
"
he
said
to
the
apprentice
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
been
so
deeply
interested
in
what
I
have
just
heard
,
that
I
quite
forgot
you
were
waiting
without
.
<EOS>
I
shall
remain
here
some
hours
longer
,
but
will
not
detain
you
,
especially
as
I
am
unable
to
admit
you
to
our
conference
.
<EOS>
I
will
meet
you
at
Doctor
Hodges
's
in
the
evening
,
and
shall
have
much
to
say
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
anticipate
some
part
of
your
communication
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
tell
me
you
have
a
daughter
still
living
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
inquisitive
,
young
man
,
"
rejoined
Thirlby
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
me
wrong
,
sir
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
curiosity
as
regards
yourself
;
and
if
I
had
,
would
never
lower
myself
in
my
own
estimation
to
gratify
it
.
<EOS>
Feeling
a
strong
interest
in
Nizza
Macascree
,
I
am
naturally
anxious
to
know
whether
my
suspicion
that
a
near
relationship
subsists
between
yourself
and
her
is
correct
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
enter
into
further
explanation
now
,
"
returned
Thirlby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Meet
me
at
Doctor
Hodges
's
this
evening
,
and
you
shall
know
more
.
<EOS>
And
now
farewell
.
<EOS>
I
am
in
the
midst
of
a
deeply
-
interesting
conversation
,
which
your
presence
interrupts
.
<EOS>
Do
not
think
me
rude
--
do
not
think
me
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
My
anxiety
must
plead
my
excuse
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
None
is
necessary
,
sir
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
no
longer
place
any
restraint
upon
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
and
taking
care
not
to
let
Bell
out
,
he
passed
through
the
door
,
and
closed
it
after
him
.
<EOS>
Having
walked
to
some
distance
across
the
fields
,
musing
on
what
had
just
occurred
,
and
scarcely
conscious
whither
<EOS>
he
was
going
,
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
grass
,
and
fell
asleep
.
<EOS>
He
awoke
after
some
time
much
refreshed
,
and
finding
he
was
considerably
nearer
Bishopsgate
than
any
other
entrance
into
the
city
,
determined
to
make
for
it
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
brought
him
to
a
row
of
houses
without
the
walls
,
none
of
which
appeared
to
have
escaped
infection
,
and
passing
them
,
he
entered
the
city
gate
.
<EOS>
As
he
proceeded
along
the
once
-
crowded
but
now
utterly
-
deserted
thoroughfare
that
opened
upon
him
,
he
could
scarcely
believe
he
was
in
a
spot
which
had
once
been
the
busiest
of
the
busy
haunts
of
men
--
so
silent
,
<EOS>
so
desolate
did
it
appear
!
<EOS>
On
reaching
Cornhill
,
he
found
it
equally
deserted
.
<EOS>
The
Exchange
was
closed
,
and
as
Leonard
looked
at
its
barred
gates
,
a
saddening
train
of
reflection
passed
through
his
mind
.
<EOS>
His
head
declined
upon
his
breast
,
and
he
continued
lost
in
a
mournful
reverie
until
he
was
roused
by
a
hand
laid
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
starting
--
for
such
a
salutation
at
this
season
was
alarming
--
he
looked
round
,
and
beheld
Solomon
Eagle
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
looking
upon
that
structure
,
"
said
the
enthusiast
,
"
and
are
thinking
how
much
it
is
changed
.
<EOS>
Men
who
possess
boundless
riches
imagine
their
power
above
that
of
their
Maker
,
and
suppose
they
may
neglect
and
defy
him
.
<EOS>
But
they
are
mistaken
.
<EOS>
Where
are
now
the
wealthy
merchants
who
used
to
haunt
those
courts
and
chambers?--why
<EOS>
do
they
not
come
here
as
of
old?--why
<EOS>
do
they
not
buy
and
sell
,
and
send
their
messengers
and
ships
to
the
farthest
parts
of
the
world
?
<EOS>
Because
the
Lord
hath
smitten
them
and
driven
them
forth--'From
the
least
of
them
even
to
the
greatest
of
them
,
'
as
the
prophet
Jeremiah
saith
,
'
every
one
has
been
given
to
covetousness
.
'
<EOS>
The
balances
of
deceit
have
been
in
their
hands
.
<EOS>
They
have
cozened
their
neighbours
,
and
greedily
gained
from
them
,
and
will
find
it
true
what
the
prophet
Ezekiel
hath
written
,
that
'
the
Lord
will
pour
out
his
indignation
upon
them
,
and
consume
them
with
the
fire
of
his
wrath
.
'
<EOS>
Yea
,
I
tell
you
,
unless
they
turn
from
their
evil
ways
--
unless
they
cast
aside
the
golden
idol
they
now
worship
,
and
set
up
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
in
its
stead
,
a
fire
will
be
sent
to
consume
them
,
and
that
pile
which
they
have
erected
as
a
temple
to
their
god
shall
be
burnt
to
the
ground
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
's
heart
was
too
full
to
make
any
answer
,
and
the
enthusiast
,
after
a
brief
pause
,
again
addressed
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
Doctor
Hodges
pass
this
way
?
<EOS>
I
am
in
search
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
what
account
?
"
asked
Leonard
anxiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
advice
,
I
trust
,
is
not
needed
on
behalf
of
any
one
in
whom
I
am
interested
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
matter
,
"
replied
Solomon
Eagle
,
in
a
sombre
tone
;
"
have
you
seen
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
,
"
rejoined
the
apprentice
;
"
but
he
is
probably
at
Saint
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
left
the
cathedral
,
and
was
told
he
had
proceeded
to
some
house
near
Cornhill
,
"
rejoined
the
enthusiast
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
been
there
,
you
can
perhaps
tell
me
how
my
master
's
porter
,
Blaize
Shotterel
,
is
getting
on
,
"
said
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
"
replied
the
enthusiast
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
one
of
the
chirurgeons
say
that
Doctor
Hodges
had
pronounced
him
in
a
fair
way
of
recovery
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
either
find
the
doctor
or
go
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Farewell
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
with
you
in
search
of
him
,
"
said
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
you
must
not
--
shall
not
,
"
cried
Solomon
Eagle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wherefore
not
?
"
asked
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
question
me
,
but
leave
me
,
"
rejoined
the
enthusiast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
aught
of
Amabel
--
of
her
retreat
?
"
<EOS>
persisted
Leonard
,
who
had
a
strange
misgiving
that
the
enthusiast
's
errand
in
some
way
referred
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
Solomon
Eagle
,
gloomily
;
"
but
I
again
advise
you
not
to
press
me
further
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Answer
me
one
question
at
least
,
"
cried
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
Is
she
with
the
Earl
of
Rochester
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
,
"
replied
Solomon
Eagle
;
"
but
I
shall
allay
your
fears
in
that
respect
when
I
tell
you
she
is
sick
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
heard
nothing
more
,
for
,
uttering
a
wild
shriek
,
he
fell
to
the
ground
insensible
.
<EOS>
He
was
aroused
to
consciousness
by
a
sudden
sense
of
strangulation
,
and
opening
his
eyes
,
beheld
two
dark
figures
bending
over
him
,
one
of
whom
was
kneeling
on
his
chest
.
<EOS>
A
glance
showed
him
that
this
person
was
Chowles
;
and
instantly
comprehending
what
was
the
matter
,
and
aware
that
the
coffin
-
maker
was
stripping
him
previously
to
throwing
him
into
the
dead
-
cart
,
which
was
standing
hard
by
,
he
cried
aloud
,
and
struggled
desperately
to
set
himself
free
.
<EOS>
Little
opposition
was
offered
;
for
,
on
hearing
the
cry
,
Chowles
quitted
his
hold
,
and
retreating
to
a
short
distance
,
exclaimed
,
with
a
look
of
surprise
,
"
Why
,
the
fellow
is
not
dead
,
after
all
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
neither
dead
,
nor
likely
to
die
,
as
you
shall
find
to
your
cost
,
rascal
,
if
you
do
not
restore
me
the
clothes
you
have
robbed
me
of
,
"
cried
Leonard
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
And
chancing
to
perceive
a
fork
,
dropped
by
Chowles
in
his
hasty
retreat
,
he
snatched
it
up
,
and
,
brandishing
it
over
his
head
,
advanced
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Thus
threatened
,
Chowles
tossed
him
a
rich
suit
of
livery
.
 
<EOS>
"
These
are
not
mine
,
"
said
the
apprentice
,
gazing
at
the
habiliments
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
better
than
your
own
,
"
replied
Chowles
,
"
and
therefore
you
ought
to
be
glad
of
the
exchange
.
<EOS>
But
give
me
them
back
again
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
intention
of
making
you
a
present
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
livery
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
"
cried
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
it
is
,
"
replied
Chowles
,
with
a
ghastly
smile
.
<EOS>
"
One
of
his
servants
is
just
dead
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
profligate
noble
?
"
cried
Leonard
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
the
person
who
owned
these
clothes
,
"
replied
Chowles
,
pointing
to
the
dead
-
cart
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
ask
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
I
say
,
villain
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Leonard
,
menacingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
know
?
"
rejoined
Chowles
.
<EOS>
"
Here
are
your
clothes
,
"
he
added
,
pushing
them
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
an
answer
,
"
cried
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
from
me
,
"
replied
Chowles
.
<EOS>
And
hastily
snatching
up
the
livery
,
he
put
the
cart
in
motion
,
and
proceeded
on
his
road
.
<EOS>
Leonard
would
have
followed
him
,
but
the
state
of
his
attire
did
not
permit
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Having
dressed
himself
,
he
hastened
to
the
cathedral
,
where
he
soon
found
the
attendant
who
had
charge
of
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Hodges
has
been
with
him
,
"
said
the
man
,
in
reply
to
his
inquiries
after
the
porter
,
"
and
has
good
hopes
of
him
.
<EOS>
But
the
patient
is
not
entirely
satisfied
with
the
treatment
he
has
received
,
and
wishes
to
try
some
remedies
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
Were
his
request
granted
,
all
would
soon
be
over
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
am
sure
of
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
But
let
us
go
to
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
heed
his
complaints
,
"
returned
the
attendant
.
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
he
is
doing
as
well
as
possible
;
but
he
is
so
dreadfully
frightened
at
a
trifling
operation
which
Doctor
Hodges
finds
it
necessary
to
perform
upon
him
,
that
we
have
been
obliged
to
fasten
him
to
the
bed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Leonard
,
suspiciously
.
"
<EOS>
Has
Judith
Malmayns
had
no
hand
in
this
arrangement
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Judith
Malmayns
has
been
absent
during
the
whole
of
the
afternoon
,
"
said
the
man
,
"
and
another
nurse
has
taken
her
place
in
Saint
Faith
's
.
<EOS>
She
has
never
been
near
Blaize
since
I
have
had
charge
of
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
they
had
reached
the
pallet
in
which
the
porter
was
laid
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
and
a
small
portion
of
his
snub
-
nose
were
alone
visible
,
his
head
being
still
enveloped
by
the
linen
cloth
,
while
his
mouth
was
covered
by
blankets
.
<EOS>
He
looked
so
anxiously
at
the
apprentice
,
that
the
latter
removed
the
covering
from
his
mouth
,
and
enabled
him
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
find
you
are
getting
on
so
well
,
"
said
Leonard
,
in
a
cheerful
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
has
been
with
you
,
I
understand
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
,
"
groaned
Blaize
;
"
but
he
has
done
me
no
good
--
<EOS>
none
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
I
could
doctor
myself
much
better
,
if
I
might
be
allowed
;
for
I
know
every
remedy
that
has
been
prescribed
for
the
plague
;
but
he
would
adopt
none
that
I
mentioned
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
him
to
place
a
hot
loaf
,
fresh
from
the
oven
,
to
the
tumour
,
to
draw
it
;
but
he
would
not
consent
.
<EOS>
Then
I
asked
for
a
cataplasm
,
composed
of
radish
-
roots
,
mustard
-
seed
,
onions
and
garlic
roasted
,
mithridate
,
salt
,
and
soot
from
a
chimney
where
wood
only
has
been
burnt
.
<EOS>
This
he
liked
no
better
than
the
first
.
<EOS>
Next
,
I
begged
for
an
ale
posset
with
pimpernel
soaked
in
it
,
assuring
him
that
by
frequently
drinking
such
a
mixture
,
Secretary
Naunton
drew
the
infection
from
his
very
heart
.
<EOS>
But
the
doctor
would
have
none
of
it
,
and
seemed
to
doubt
the
fact
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
do
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
applied
oil
of
St.
John
's
wort
to
the
tumour
,
"
replied
Blaize
,
with
a
dismal
groan
,
and
said
,
"
if
the
scar
did
not
fall
off
,
he
must
cauterize
it
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
able
to
bear
the
pain
of
the
operation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Recollect
your
life
is
at
stake
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
either
submit
to
it
or
die
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
must
,
"
replied
Blaize
,
with
a
prolonged
groan
;
"
but
it
is
a
terrible
alternative
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
find
the
operation
so
painful
as
you
imagine
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
;
"
and
you
know
I
speak
from
personal
experience
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
give
me
great
comfort
,
"
said
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
really
think
I
shall
get
better
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
of
it
,
if
you
keep
up
your
spirits
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
The
worst
is
evidently
over
.
<EOS>
Behave
like
a
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
to
do
so
,
"
rejoined
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
told
that
if
a
circle
is
drawn
with
a
blue
sapphire
round
a
plague
-
blotch
,
it
will
fall
off
.
<EOS>
Could
n't
we
just
try
the
experiment
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
do
to
rely
upon
it
,
"
observed
the
attendant
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
a
small
knob
of
red
-
hot
iron
,
which
we
call
the
'
button
,
'
much
more
efficacious
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
!
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Blaize
,
"
I
already
feel
that
dreadful
button
burning
into
my
flesh
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
you
wo
n't
feel
it
at
all
,
"
replied
the
attendant
.
<EOS>
"
The
iron
only
touches
the
point
of
the
tumour
,
in
which
there
is
no
sensibility
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
,
I
do
n't
care
how
soon
the
operation
is
performed
,
"
replied
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Hodges
will
choose
his
own
time
for
it
,
"
said
the
attendant
.
<EOS>
"
In
the
mean
time
,
here
is
a
cup
of
barley
-
broth
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
it
do
you
good
.
"
 
<EOS>
While
the
man
applied
the
cup
to
the
poor
porter
's
lips
--
for
he
would
not
unloose
the
straps
,
for
fear
of
mischief
--
Leonard
,
who
was
sickened
by
the
terrible
scene
around
him
,
took
his
departure
,
and
quitted
the
cathedral
by
the
great
western
entrance
.
<EOS>
Seating
himself
on
one
of
the
great
blocks
of
stone
left
there
by
the
workmen
employed
in
repairing
the
cathedral
,
but
who
had
long
since
abandoned
their
task
,
he
thought
over
all
that
had
recently
occurred
.
<EOS>
Raising
his
eyes
at
length
,
he
looked
toward
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
The
oblique
rays
of
the
sun
had
quitted
the
columns
of
the
portico
,
which
looked
cold
and
grey
,
while
the
roof
and
towers
were
glittering
in
light
.
<EOS>
In
ten
minutes
more
,
only
the
summit
of
the
central
tower
caught
the
last
reflection
of
the
declining
orb
.
<EOS>
Leonard
watched
the
rosy
gleam
till
it
disappeared
,
and
then
steadfastly
regarded
the
reverend
pile
as
its
hue
changed
from
grey
to
black
,
until
at
length
each
pinnacle
and
buttress
,
each
battlement
and
tower
,
was
lost
in
one
vast
indistinct
mass
.
<EOS>
Night
had
fallen
upon
the
city
--
a
night
destined
to
be
more
fatal
than
any
that
had
preceded
it
;
and
yet
it
was
so
calm
,
so
beautiful
,
so
clear
,
that
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
imagine
that
it
was
unhealthy
.
<EOS>
The
destroying
angel
was
,
however
,
fearfully
at
work
.
<EOS>
Hundreds
were
falling
beneath
his
touch
;
and
as
Leonard
wondered
how
many
miserable
wretches
were
at
that
moment
released
from
suffering
,
it
crossed
him
like
an
icy
chill
,
that
among
the
number
might
be
Amabel
.
<EOS>
So
forcibly
was
he
impressed
by
this
idea
,
that
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
prayed
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
aroused
by
hearing
the
ringing
of
a
bell
,
which
announced
the
approach
of
the
dead
-
cart
,
and
presently
afterwards
the
gloomy
vehicle
approached
from
Ludgate
-
hill
,
and
moved
slowly
towards
the
portico
of
the
cathedral
,
where
it
halted
.
<EOS>
A
great
number
of
the
dead
were
placed
within
it
,
and
the
driver
,
ringing
his
bell
,
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
Cheapside
.
<EOS>
A
very
heavy
dew
had
fallen
;
for
as
Leonard
put
his
hand
to
his
clothes
,
they
felt
damp
,
and
his
long
hair
was
filled
with
moisture
.
<EOS>
Reproaching
himself
with
having
needlessly
exposed
himself
to
risk
,
he
was
about
to
walk
away
,
when
he
heard
footsteps
at
a
little
distance
,
and
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
,
perceived
the
tall
figure
of
Thirlby
.
<EOS>
Calling
to
him
,
the
other
,
who
appeared
to
be
in
haste
,
halted
for
a
moment
,
and
telling
the
apprentice
he
was
going
to
Doctor
Hodges
's
,
desired
him
to
accompany
him
thither
,
and
went
on
.

<EOS>
THE
HOUSE
IN
NICHOLAS
-
LANE
.
 
<EOS>
On
reaching
Watling
-
street
,
Leonard
and
his
companion
found
Doctor
Hodges
was
from
home
.
<EOS>
This
did
not
much
surprise
the
apprentice
,
after
the
information
he
had
received
from
Solomon
Eagle
,
but
Thirlby
was
greatly
disappointed
,
and
eagerly
questioned
the
porter
as
to
the
probable
time
of
his
master
's
return
.
<EOS>
The
man
replied
that
it
was
quite
uncertain
,
adding
,
"
He
has
been
in
since
you
were
last
here
,
and
has
seen
Blaize
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
gone
to
the
cathedral
many
minutes
when
a
gentleman
arrived
,
desiring
his
instant
attendance
upon
a
young
woman
who
was
sick
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hear
her
name
?
"
asked
Leonard
and
Thirlby
,
in
a
breath
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
the
porter
,
"
<EOS>
neither
did
I
obtain
any
information
respecting
her
from
the
gentleman
,
who
appeared
in
great
distress
.
<EOS>
But
I
observed
that
my
master
,
on
his
return
,
looked
much
surprised
at
seeing
him
,
and
treated
him
with
a
sort
of
cold
respect
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Was
the
gentleman
young
or
old
?
"
demanded
Leonard
,
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
I
noticed
,
"
replied
the
porter
,
"
for
he
kept
his
face
covered
with
a
handkerchief
<EOS>
,
I
should
say
he
was
young
--
very
young
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
sure
it
was
not
Lord
Rochester
?
"
pursued
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
be
sure
of
it
,
"
rejoined
the
porter
,
"
since
I
have
never
seen
his
lordship
that
I
am
aware
of
?
<EOS>
But
I
will
tell
you
all
that
happened
,
and
you
can
judge
for
yourselves
.
<EOS>
My
master
,
as
I
have
just
said
,
on
seeing
the
stranger
,
looked
surprised
and
angry
,
and
bowing
gravely
,
conducted
him
to
his
study
,
taking
care
to
close
the
door
after
him
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
,
of
course
,
hear
what
passed
,
but
the
interview
was
brief
enough
,
and
the
gentleman
,
issuing
forth
,
said
,
as
he
quitted
the
room
,
'
You
will
not
fail
to
come
?
'
<EOS>
To
which
my
master
replied
,
'
Certainly
not
,
on
the
terms
I
have
mentioned
.
'
<EOS>
With
this
,
the
gentleman
hurried
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
the
doctor
came
out
,
and
said
to
me
,
'
I
am
going
to
attend
a
young
woman
who
is
sick
of
the
plague
,
and
may
be
absent
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Thirlby
or
Leonard
Holt
should
call
,
detain
them
till
my
return
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
heart
tells
me
that
the
young
woman
he
is
gone
to
visit
is
no
other
than
Amabel
,
"
said
Leonard
Holt
,
sorrowfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
it
is
Nizza
Macascree
,
"
cried
Thirlby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Which
way
did
your
master
take
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
observe
,
"
replied
the
porter
,
"
but
he
told
me
he
should
cross
London
Bridge
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
into
Southwark
in
quest
of
him
,
"
said
Thirlby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Every
moment
is
of
consequence
now
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
stay
where
you
are
,
"
replied
the
old
porter
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
surest
way
to
meet
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thirlby
,
however
,
was
too
full
of
anxiety
to
listen
to
reason
,
and
his
impatience
producing
a
corresponding
effect
upon
Leonard
,
though
from
a
different
motive
,
they
set
forth
together
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
fail
to
find
him
,
you
may
expect
me
back
ere
long
,
"
were
Thirlby
's
last
words
to
the
porter
.
<EOS>
Hurrying
along
Watling
-
street
,
and
taking
the
first
turning
on
the
right
,
he
descended
to
Thames
-
street
,
and
made
the
best
of
his
way
towards
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
Leonard
followed
him
closely
,
and
they
pursued
their
rapid
course
in
silence
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
they
reached
the
north
gate
of
the
bridge
,
Leonard
found
his
strength
failing
him
,
and
halting
at
one
of
the
openings
between
the
tall
houses
overlooking
the
river
,
where
there
was
a
wooden
bench
for
the
accommodation
of
passengers
,
he
sank
upon
it
,
and
begged
Thirlby
to
go
on
,
saying
he
would
return
to
Watling
-
street
as
soon
as
he
recovered
from
his
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
Thirlby
did
not
attempt
to
dissuade
him
from
his
purpose
,
but
instantly
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
,
it
has
before
been
remarked
,
was
singularly
beautiful
.
<EOS>
It
was
almost
as
light
as
day
,
for
the
full
harvest
moon
(
alas
!
<EOS>
there
was
no
harvest
for
it
to
smile
upon
!
)
<EOS>
having
just
risen
,
revealed
every
object
with
perfect
distinctness
.
<EOS>
The
bench
on
which
Leonard
was
seated
lay
on
the
right
side
of
the
bridge
,
and
commanded
a
magnificent
reach
of
the
river
,
that
flowed
beneath
like
a
sheet
of
molten
silver
.
<EOS>
The
apprentice
gazed
along
its
banks
,
and
noticed
the
tall
spectral
-
looking
houses
on
the
right
,
until
his
eye
finally
settled
on
the
massive
fabric
of
Saint
Paul
's
,
the
roof
and
towers
of
which
rose
high
above
the
lesser
structures
.
<EOS>
His
meditations
were
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
opening
of
a
window
in
the
house
near
him
,
while
a
loud
splash
in
the
water
told
that
a
body
had
been
thrown
into
it
.
<EOS>
He
turned
away
with
a
shudder
,
and
at
the
same
moment
perceived
a
watchman
,
with
a
halberd
upon
his
shoulder
,
advancing
slowly
towards
him
from
the
Southwark
side
of
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
Pausing
as
he
drew
near
the
apprentice
,
the
watchman
compassionately
inquired
whether
he
was
sick
,
and
being
answered
in
the
negative
,
was
about
to
pass
on
,
when
Leonard
,
fancying
he
recognised
his
voice
,
stopped
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
met
somewhere
before
,
friend
,
"
he
said
,
"
though
where
,
or
under
what
circumstances
,
I
can
not
at
this
moment
call
to
mind
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
unlikely
,
"
returned
the
other
,
roughly
,
"
but
the
chances
are
against
our
meeting
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
heaved
a
sigh
at
this
remark
.
<EOS>
"
I
now
recollect
where
I
met
you
,
friend
,
"
he
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
at
Saint
Paul
's
,
when
I
was
in
search
of
my
master
's
daughter
,
who
had
been
carried
off
by
the
Earl
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
But
you
were
then
in
the
garb
of
a
smith
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
recollect
the
circumstance
,
too
,
now
you
remind
me
of
it
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
name
is
Leonard
Holt
as
surely
as
mine
is
Robert
Rainbird
.
<EOS>
I
recollect
,
also
,
that
you
offended
me
about
a
dog
belonging
to
the
piper
's
pretty
daughter
,
Nizza
Macascree
,
which
I
was
about
to
destroy
in
obedience
to
the
Lord
Mayor
's
commands
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
bear
no
malice
,
and
if
I
did
,
this
is
not
a
time
to
rip
up
old
quarrels
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
friend
,
"
returned
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
The
few
of
us
left
ought
to
be
in
charity
with
each
other
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
ought
we
,
"
rejoined
Rainbird
.
<EOS>
"
For
my
own
part
,
I
have
seen
so
much
misery
within
the
last
few
weeks
,
that
my
disposition
is
wholly
changed
.
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
abandon
my
old
occupation
of
a
smith
,
because
my
master
died
of
the
plague
,
and
there
was
no
one
else
to
employ
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
therefore
served
as
a
watchman
,
and
in
twenty
days
have
stood
at
the
doors
of
more
than
twenty
houses
.
<EOS>
It
would
freeze
your
blood
were
I
to
relate
the
scenes
I
have
witnessed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
might
have
done
formerly
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
"
but
my
feelings
are
as
much
changed
as
your
own
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
the
plague
twice
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
indeed
,
you
_
can
_
speak
,
"
replied
Rainbird
.
"
<EOS>
Thank
God
,
I
have
hitherto
escaped
it
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
these
are
terrible
times
--
terrible
times
!
<EOS>
The
worst
that
ever
London
knew
.
<EOS>
Although
I
have
been
hitherto
miraculously
preserved
myself
,
I
am
firmly
persuaded
no
one
will
escape
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
almost
inclined
to
agree
with
you
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
the
last
week
the
distemper
has
raged
fearfully
--
fearfully
,
indeed
,
"
said
Rainbird
;
"
but
yesterday
and
to
-
day
have
far
exceeded
all
that
have
gone
before
.
<EOS>
The
distempered
have
died
quicker
than
cattle
of
the
murrain
.
<EOS>
I
visited
upwards
of
a
hundred
houses
in
the
Borough
this
morning
,
and
only
found
ten
persons
alive
;
and
out
of
those
ten
,
not
one
,
I
will
venture
to
say
,
is
alive
now
.
<EOS>
It
will
,
in
truth
,
be
a
mercy
if
they
are
gone
.
<EOS>
There
were
distracted
mothers
raving
over
their
children,--a
young
husband
lamenting
his
wife,--two
little
children
weeping
over
their
dead
parents
,
with
none
to
attend
them
,
none
to
feed
them,--an
old
man
mourning
over
his
son
cut
off
in
his
prime
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
misery
and
distress
in
their
worst
form,--the
streets
ringing
with
shrieks
and
groans
,
and
the
numbers
of
dead
so
great
that
it
was
impossible
to
carry
them
off
.
<EOS>
You
remember
Solomon
Eagle
's
prophecy
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
"
and
I
lament
to
see
its
fulfilment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
The
streets
shall
be
covered
with
grass
,
and
the
living
shall
not
be
able
to
bury
their
dead,'--so
<EOS>
it
ran
,
"
said
Rainbird
.
<EOS>
"
And
it
has
come
to
pass
.
<EOS>
Not
a
carriage
of
any
description
,
save
the
dead
-
cart
,
is
to
be
seen
in
the
broadest
streets
of
London
,
which
are
now
as
green
as
the
fields
without
her
walls
,
and
as
silent
as
the
grave
itself
.
<EOS>
Terrible
times
,
as
I
said
before
--
terrible
times
!
<EOS>
The
dead
are
rotting
in
heaps
in
the
courts
,
in
the
alleys
,
in
the
very
houses
,
and
no
one
to
remove
them
.
<EOS>
What
will
be
the
end
of
it
all
?
<EOS>
What
will
become
of
this
great
city
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
difficult
to
foresee
what
will
become
of
it
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
"
unless
it
pleases
the
Lord
to
stay
his
vengeful
arm
.
<EOS>
And
something
whispers
in
my
ear
that
we
are
now
at
the
worst
.
<EOS>
The
scourge
can
not
exceed
its
present
violence
without
working
our
ruin
;
and
deeply
as
we
have
sinned
,
little
as
we
repent
,
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
believe
that
God
will
sweep
his
people
entirely
from
the
face
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
not
hope
otherwise
,
"
rejoined
Rainbird
,
"
though
I
would
fain
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
discern
no
symptoms
of
abatement
of
the
distemper
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
an
evident
increase
of
malignity
,
and
such
is
the
opinion
of
all
I
have
spoken
with
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Chowles
told
me
he
buried
two
hundred
more
yesterday
than
he
had
ever
done
before
,
and
yet
he
did
not
carry
a
third
of
the
dead
to
the
plague
-
pit
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
strange
fellow
that
Chowles
.
<EOS>
But
for
his
passion
for
his
horrible
calling
there
is
no
necessity
for
him
to
follow
it
,
for
he
is
now
one
of
the
richest
men
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
must
have
amassed
his
riches
by
robbery
,
then
,
"
remarked
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
returned
Rainbird
.
"
<EOS>
He
helps
himself
without
scruple
to
the
clothes
,
goods
,
and
other
property
,
of
all
who
die
of
the
pestilence
;
and
after
ransacking
their
houses
,
conveys
his
plunder
in
the
dead
-
cart
to
his
own
dwelling
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
Saint
Paul
's
?
"
asked
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
--
a
large
house
in
Nicholas
-
lane
,
once
belonging
to
a
wealthy
merchant
,
who
perished
,
with
his
family
,
of
the
plague
,
"
replied
Rainbird
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
filled
it
from
cellar
to
garret
with
the
spoil
he
has
obtained
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
how
has
he
preserved
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
plague
has
preserved
it
for
him
,
"
replied
Rainbird
.
<EOS>
"
The
few
authorities
who
now
act
have
,
perhaps
,
no
knowledge
of
his
proceedings
;
or
if
they
have
,
have
not
cared
to
interfere
,
awaiting
a
more
favourable
season
,
if
it
should
ever
arrive
,
to
dispossess
him
of
his
hoard
,
and
punish
him
for
his
delinquencies
;
while
,
in
the
mean
time
,
they
are
glad
,
on
any
terms
,
to
avail
themselves
of
his
services
as
a
burier
.
<EOS>
Other
people
do
not
care
to
meddle
with
him
,
and
the
most
daring
robber
would
be
afraid
to
touch
infected
money
or
clothes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
going
towards
Nicholas
-
lane
,
"
said
Leonard
,
as
if
struck
with
a
sudden
idea
,
"
and
will
point
out
to
me
the
house
in
question
,
you
will
do
me
a
favour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Rainbird
nodded
assent
,
and
they
walked
on
together
towards
Fish
-
street
-
hill
.
<EOS>
Ascending
it
,
and
turning
off
on
the
right
,
they
entered
Great
Eastcheap
,
but
had
not
proceeded
far
when
they
were
obliged
to
turn
back
,
the
street
being
literally
choked
up
with
a
pile
of
carcasses
deposited
there
by
the
burier
's
assistants
.
<EOS>
Shaping
their
course
along
Gracechurch
-
street
,
they
turned
off
into
Lombard
-
street
,
and
as
Leonard
gazed
at
the
goldsmiths
'
houses
on
either
side
,
which
were
all
shut
up
,
with
the
fatal
red
cross
on
the
doors
,
he
could
not
help
remarking
to
his
companion
,
"
The
plague
has
not
spared
any
of
these
on
account
of
their
riches
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
and
of
the
thousands
who
used
formerly
to
throng
this
street
not
one
is
left
.
<EOS>
Wo
to
London!--wo!--wo
!
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
echoed
the
sentiment
,
and
fell
into
a
melancholy
train
of
reflection
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
more
than
once
remarked
that
the
particular
day
now
under
consideration
was
the
one
in
which
the
plague
exercised
its
fiercest
dominion
over
the
city
;
and
though
at
first
its
decline
was
as
imperceptible
as
the
gradual
diminution
of
the
day
after
the
longest
has
passed
,
yet
still
the
alteration
began
.
<EOS>
On
that
day
,
as
if
death
had
known
that
his
power
was
to
be
speedily
arrested
,
he
sharpened
his
fellest
arrows
,
and
discharged
them
with
unerring
aim
.
<EOS>
To
pursue
the
course
of
the
destroyer
from
house
to
house
--
to
show
with
what
unrelenting
fury
he
assailed
his
victims
--
to
describe
their
sufferings
--
to
number
the
dead
left
within
their
beds
,
thrown
into
the
streets
,
or
conveyed
to
the
plague
-
pits
--
would
be
to
present
a
narrative
as
painful
as
revolting
.
<EOS>
On
this
terrible
night
it
was
as
hot
as
if
it
had
been
the
middle
of
June
.
<EOS>
No
air
was
stirring
,
and
the
silence
was
so
profound
,
that
a
slight
noise
was
audible
at
a
great
distance
.
<EOS>
Hushed
in
the
seemingly
placid
repose
lay
the
great
city
,
while
hundreds
of
its
inhabitants
were
groaning
in
agony
,
or
breathing
their
last
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
upper
end
of
Nicholas
-
lane
,
Rainbird
stood
still
for
a
moment
,
and
pointed
out
a
large
house
on
the
right
,
just
below
the
old
church
dedicated
to
the
saint
from
which
the
thoroughfare
took
its
name
.
<EOS>
They
were
about
to
proceed
towards
it
,
when
the
smith
again
paused
,
and
called
Leonard
's
attention
to
two
figures
quickly
advancing
from
the
lower
end
of
the
street
.
<EOS>
As
the
apprentice
and
his
companion
stood
in
the
shade
,
they
could
not
be
seen
,
while
the
two
persons
,
being
in
the
moonlight
,
were
fully
revealed
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
,
it
was
easy
to
perceive
,
was
Chowles
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
before
the
door
of
his
dwelling
and
unfastened
it
,
and
while
he
was
thus
occupied
,
the
other
person
turned
his
face
so
as
to
catch
the
full
radiance
of
the
moon
,
disclosing
the
features
of
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
Before
Leonard
recovered
from
the
surprise
into
which
he
was
thrown
by
this
unexpected
discovery
,
they
had
entered
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
hurried
forward
,
but
,
to
his
great
disappointment
,
found
the
door
locked
.
<EOS>
Anxious
to
get
into
the
house
without
alarming
those
who
had
preceded
him
,
he
glanced
at
the
windows
;
but
the
shutters
were
closed
and
strongly
barred
.
<EOS>
While
hesitating
what
to
do
,
Rainbird
came
up
,
and
guessing
his
wishes
,
told
him
there
was
a
door
at
the
back
of
the
house
by
which
he
might
probably
gain
admittance
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
they
hastened
down
a
passage
skirting
the
churchyard
,
which
brought
them
to
a
narrow
alley
lying
between
Nicholas
-
lane
and
Abchurch
-
lane
.
<EOS>
Tracking
it
for
about
twenty
yards
,
Rainbird
paused
before
a
small
yard
-
door
,
and
trying
the
latch
,
found
it
yielded
to
his
touch
.
 
<EOS>
Crossing
the
yard
,
they
came
to
another
door
.
<EOS>
It
was
locked
,
and
though
they
could
have
easily
burst
it
open
,
they
preferred
having
recourse
to
an
adjoining
window
,
the
shutter
of
which
,
being
carelessly
fastened
,
was
removed
without
noise
or
difficulty
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
they
gained
a
small
dark
room
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
whence
they
issued
into
a
passage
,
<EOS>
where
,
to
their
great
joy
,
they
found
a
lighted
lantern
placed
on
a
chair
.
<EOS>
Leonard
hastily
possessed
himself
of
it
,
and
was
about
to
enter
a
room
on
the
left
when
his
companion
arrested
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Before
we
proceed
further
,
"
he
said
in
a
low
voice
,
"
I
must
know
what
you
are
about
to
do
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
purpose
will
be
explained
in
a
word
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
that
Nizza
Macascree
is
confined
here
by
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
and
Chowles
,
and
if
it
turns
out
I
am
right
in
my
conjecture
,
I
propose
to
liberate
her
.
<EOS>
Will
you
help
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Rainbird
,
"
I
do
n't
much
fancy
the
job
.
<EOS>
However
,
since
I
am
here
,
I
'll
not
go
back
.
<EOS>
I
am
curious
to
see
the
coffin
-
maker
's
hoards
.
<EOS>
Look
at
yon
heap
of
clothes
.
<EOS>
There
are
velvet
doublets
and
silken
hose
enow
to
furnish
wardrobes
for
a
dozen
court
gallants
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
rich
as
the
stuffs
are
,
I
would
not
put
the
best
of
them
on
for
all
the
wealth
of
London
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
I
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
make
free
,
however
,
with
a
sword
,
"
he
added
,
selecting
one
from
the
heap
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
need
a
weapon
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
require
nothing
more
than
my
halberd
,
"
observed
the
smith
;
"
and
I
would
advise
you
to
throw
away
that
velvet
scabbard
;
it
is
a
certain
harbour
for
infection
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
did
not
neglect
the
caution
,
and
pushing
open
the
door
,
they
entered
a
large
room
which
resembled
an
upholsterer
's
shop
,
being
literally
crammed
with
chairs
,
tables
,
cabinets
,
moveable
cupboards
,
bedsteads
,
curtains
,
and
hangings
,
all
of
the
richest
description
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
I
heard
is
true
,
"
observed
Rainbird
,
gazing
around
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
Chowles
must
have
carried
off
every
thing
he
could
lay
hands
upon
.
<EOS>
What
can
he
do
with
all
that
furniture
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
the
miser
does
with
his
store
,
"
replied
Leonard
:
"
<EOS>
feast
his
eyes
with
it
,
but
never
use
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
then
proceeded
to
the
next
room
.
<EOS>
It
was
crowded
with
books
,
looking
-
glasses
,
and
pictures
;
many
of
them
originally
of
great
value
,
but
greatly
damaged
by
the
careless
manner
in
which
they
were
piled
one
upon
another
.
<EOS>
A
third
apartment
was
filled
with
flasks
of
wine
,
with
casks
probably
containing
spirits
,
and
boxes
,
the
contents
of
which
they
did
not
pause
to
examine
.
<EOS>
A
fourth
contained
male
and
female
habiliments
,
spread
out
like
the
dresses
in
a
theatrical
wardrobe
.
<EOS>
Most
of
these
garments
were
of
the
gayest
and
costliest
description
,
and
of
the
latest
fashion
,
and
Leonard
sighed
as
he
looked
upon
them
,
and
thought
of
the
fate
of
those
they
had
so
lately
adorned
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
contagion
enough
in
those
clothes
to
infect
a
whole
city
,
"
said
Rainbird
,
who
regarded
them
with
different
feelings
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
half
a
mind
to
set
fire
to
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
were
a
good
deed
to
do
so
,
"
returned
Leonard
;
"
but
it
must
not
be
done
now
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
upstairs
.
<EOS>
These
are
the
only
rooms
below
.
"
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
they
ascended
the
staircase
,
and
entered
chamber
after
chamber
,
all
of
which
were
as
full
of
spoil
as
those
they
had
just
visited
;
but
they
could
find
no
one
,
nor
was
there
any
symptom
that
the
house
was
tenanted
.
<EOS>
They
next
stood
still
within
the
gallery
,
and
listened
intently
for
some
sound
to
reveal
those
they
sought
,
but
all
was
still
and
silent
as
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
can
not
be
mistaken
,
"
observed
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
clear
this
house
is
the
receptacle
for
Chowles
's
plunder
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
we
should
not
have
found
the
lantern
burning
if
they
had
gone
forth
again
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
;
they
must
be
hidden
somewhere
,
and
I
will
not
quit
the
place
till
I
find
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Their
search
,
however
,
was
fruitless
.
<EOS>
They
mounted
to
the
garrets
,
opened
every
door
,
and
glanced
into
every
corner
.
<EOS>
Still
,
no
one
was
to
be
seen
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
think
Nizza
can
not
be
here
,
"
said
the
apprentice
;
"
but
I
am
resolved
not
to
depart
without
questioning
Chowles
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
find
him
first
,
"
rejoined
Rainbird
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
is
anywhere
,
he
must
be
in
the
cellar
,
for
we
have
been
into
every
room
in
this
part
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
think
you
had
better
abandon
the
search
altogether
.
<EOS>
No
good
will
come
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
,
however
,
was
not
to
be
dissuaded
,
and
they
went
downstairs
.
<EOS>
A
short
flight
of
stone
steps
brought
them
to
a
spacious
kitchen
,
but
it
was
quite
empty
,
and
seemed
to
have
been
long
disused
.
<EOS>
They
then
peeped
into
the
scullery
adjoining
,
and
were
about
to
retrace
their
steps
,
when
Rainbird
plucked
Leonard
's
sleeve
to
call
attention
to
a
gleam
of
light
issuing
from
a
door
which
stood
partly
ajar
,
in
a
long
narrow
passage
leading
apparently
to
the
cellars
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
there
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
see
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
And
raising
his
finger
to
his
lips
in
token
of
silence
,
he
stole
forward
on
the
points
of
his
feet
and
cautiously
opened
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
further
end
of
the
cellar
--
for
such
it
was
--
knelt
Chowles
,
examining
with
greedy
eyes
the
contents
of
a
large
chest
,
which
,
from
the
hasty
glance
that
Leonard
caught
of
it
,
appeared
to
be
filled
with
gold
and
silver
plate
.
<EOS>
A
link
stuck
against
the
wall
threw
a
strong
light
over
the
scene
,
and
showed
that
the
coffin
-
maker
was
alone
.
<EOS>
As
Leonard
advanced
,
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
caught
Chowles
's
ear
,
and
uttering
a
cry
of
surprise
and
alarm
,
he
let
fall
the
lid
of
the
chest
,
and
sprang
to
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
he
cried
,
looking
uneasily
round
,
as
if
in
search
of
some
weapon
.
"
<EOS>
Are
you
come
to
rob
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
<EOS>
"
neither
are
we
come
to
reclaim
the
plunder
you
have
taken
from
others
.
<EOS>
We
are
come
in
search
of
Nizza
Macascree
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
have
come
on
a
fool
's
errand
,
"
replied
Chowles
,
regaining
his
courage
,
"
<EOS>
for
she
is
not
here
.
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
false
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
just
conducted
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
to
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
assertion
on
the
part
of
the
apprentice
,
which
he
thought
himself
justified
under
the
circumstances
in
making
,
produced
a
strong
effect
on
Chowles
.
<EOS>
He
appeared
startled
and
confounded
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
right
have
you
to
play
the
spy
upon
me
thus
?
<EOS>
"
he
faltered
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
right
that
every
honest
man
possesses
to
check
the
designs
of
the
wicked
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
You
admit
she
is
here
.
<EOS>
Lead
me
to
her
hiding
-
place
without
more
ado
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
know
where
it
is
,
"
rejoined
Chowles
,
who
now
perceived
the
trick
that
had
been
practised
upon
him
<EOS>
,
"
you
will
not
want
me
to
conduct
you
to
it
.
<EOS>
Neither
Nizza
nor
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
are
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
false
,
prevaricating
scoundrel
,
"
cried
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
My
companion
and
I
saw
you
enter
the
house
with
your
profligate
employer
.
<EOS>
And
as
we
gained
admittance
a
few
minutes
after
you
,
it
is
certain
no
one
can
have
left
it
.
<EOS>
Lead
me
to
Nizza
's
retreat
instantly
,
or
I
will
cut
your
throat
.
"
<EOS>
And
seizing
Chowles
by
the
collar
,
he
held
the
point
of
his
sword
to
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Use
no
violence
,
"
cried
Chowles
,
struggling
to
free
himself
,
"
and
I
will
take
you
wherever
you
please
.
<EOS>
This
way
--
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
And
he
motioned
as
if
he
would
take
them
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
think
to
mislead
me
,
villain
,
"
cried
Leonard
,
tightening
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
searched
every
room
in
the
upper
part
of
the
house
,
and
though
we
have
discovered
the
whole
of
your
ill
-
gotten
hoards
,
we
have
found
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
No
one
is
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
rejoined
Chowles
,
<EOS>
"
since
the
truth
must
out
,
Sir
Paul
is
in
the
next
house
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
his
own
abode
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
<EOS>
nothing
whatever
.
<EOS>
He
is
accountable
for
his
own
actions
,
and
you
will
be
accountable
to
_
him
<EOS>
_
if
you
intrude
upon
his
privacy
.
<EOS>
Release
me
,
and
I
swear
to
conduct
you
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
take
the
consequences
of
your
rashness
upon
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
only
go
upon
compulsion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
ready
to
take
any
consequences
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
resolutely
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
along
,
then
,
"
said
Chowles
,
pointing
down
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
mean
us
no
mischief
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Leonard
,
suspiciously
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
,
the
attempt
will
cost
you
your
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
Chowles
made
no
answer
,
but
moved
along
the
passage
as
quickly
as
Leonard
,
who
kept
fast
hold
of
him
and
walked
by
his
side
,
would
permit
.
<EOS>
Presently
they
reached
a
door
,
which
neither
the
apprentice
nor
Rainbird
had
observed
before
,
and
which
admitted
them
into
an
extensive
vault
,
with
a
short
staircase
at
the
further
end
,
communicating
with
a
passage
that
Leonard
did
not
require
to
be
informed
was
in
another
house
.
 
<EOS>
Here
Chowles
paused
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
right
to
warn
you
you
are
running
into
a
danger
from
which
ere
long
you
will
be
glad
to
draw
back
,
young
man
,
"
he
said
,
to
the
apprentice
.
"
<EOS>
As
a
friend
,
I
advise
you
to
proceed
no
further
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Waste
no
more
time
in
talking
,
"
cried
Leonard
,
fiercely
,
and
forcing
him
forward
as
he
spoke
,
<EOS>
"
where
is
Nizza
?
<EOS>
Lead
me
to
her
without
an
instant
's
delay
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
wilful
man
must
have
his
way
,
"
returned
Chowles
,
hurrying
up
the
main
staircase
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
my
fault
if
any
harm
befalls
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
had
just
gained
the
landing
when
a
door
on
the
right
was
suddenly
thrown
open
,
and
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
stood
before
them
.
<EOS>
He
looked
surprised
and
startled
at
the
sight
of
the
apprentice
,
and
angrily
demanded
his
business
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
for
Nizza
Macascree
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
"
whom
you
and
Chowles
have
detained
against
her
will
.
"
 
<EOS>
Parravicin
glanced
sternly
and
inquiringly
at
the
coffin
-
maker
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
protested
to
him
that
she
is
not
here
,
Sir
Paul
,
"
said
the
latter
,
"
but
he
will
not
believe
me
,
and
has
compelled
me
,
by
threats
of
taking
my
life
,
to
bring
him
and
his
companion
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
take
them
back
again
,
"
rejoined
Parravicin
,
turning
haughtily
upon
his
heel
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
answer
will
not
suffice
,
Sir
Paul
,
"
cried
Leonard--"I
will
not
depart
without
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
!
"
exclaimed
the
knight
,
drawing
his
sword
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
dare
to
intrude
upon
my
presence
?
<EOS>
Begone
!
<EOS>
or
I
will
punish
your
presumption
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
prepared
to
attack
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Advance
a
footstep
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
,
who
had
never
relinquished
his
grasp
of
Chowles
,
"
and
I
pass
my
sword
through
this
man
's
body
.
<EOS>
Speak
,
villain
,
"
he
continued
,
in
a
tone
so
formidable
that
the
coffin
-
maker
shook
with
apprehension--"is
she
here
or
not
?
"
<EOS>
Chowles
gazed
from
him
to
the
knight
,
whose
deportment
was
equally
menacing
and
appeared
bewildered
with
terror
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
needless
,
"
said
Leonard
,
"
<EOS>
your
looks
answer
for
you
.
<EOS>
She
_
is
_
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
I
confess
she
is
,
"
replied
Chowles
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
hear
what
he
says
,
Sir
Paul
,
"
remarked
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
fears
would
make
him
assert
anything
,
"
rejoined
Parravicin
,
disdainfully
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
not
depart
instantly
,
I
will
drive
you
forth
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
,
in
an
authoritative
tone
,
"
I
command
you
in
the
king
's
name
,
to
deliver
up
this
girl
.
"
 
<EOS>
Parravicin
laughed
scornfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
king
has
no
authority
here
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
Sir
Paul
,
"
rejoined
Chowles
,
who
began
to
be
seriously
alarmed
at
his
own
situation
,
and
eagerly
grasped
at
the
opportunity
that
offered
of
extricating
himself
from
it--"pardon
me
.
<EOS>
If
it
is
the
king
's
pleasure
she
should
be
removed
,
it
materially
alters
the
case
,
and
I
can
be
no
party
to
her
detention
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Both
you
and
your
employer
will
incur
his
majesty
's
severest
displeasure
,
by
detaining
her
after
this
notice
,
"
remarked
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Before
I
listen
to
the
young
man
's
request
,
let
him
declare
that
it
is
his
intention
to
deliver
her
up
to
the
king
,
"
rejoined
Parravicin
,
coldly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
intention
to
deliver
her
up
to
one
who
has
the
best
right
to
take
charge
of
her
,
"
returned
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
mean
her
father
,
"
sneered
Parravicin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
but
not
the
person
you
suppose
to
be
her
father
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
An
important
discovery
has
been
made
respecting
her
parentage
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Parravicin
,
with
a
look
of
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
Who
has
the
honour
to
be
her
father
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
gentleman
named
Thirlby
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Parravicin
,
starting
,
and
turning
pale
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
say
Thirlby
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
apprentice
reiterated
his
assertion
.
<EOS>
Parravicin
uttered
a
deep
groan
,
and
pressed
his
hand
forcibly
against
his
brow
for
some
moments
,
during
which
the
apprentice
watched
him
narrowly
.
<EOS>
He
then
controlled
himself
by
a
powerful
effort
,
and
returned
his
sword
to
its
scabbard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
into
this
room
,
young
man
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
to
the
apprentice
,
"
and
let
your
companion
remain
outside
with
Chowles
.
<EOS>
Fear
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
intend
you
no
injury
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
distrust
you
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
"
and
if
I
did
,
should
have
no
apprehension
.
"
<EOS>
And
motioning
Rainbird
to
remain
where
he
was
,
he
entered
the
room
with
the
knight
,
who
instantly
closed
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Parravicin
's
first
proceeding
was
to
question
him
as
to
his
reasons
for
supposing
Nizza
to
be
Thirlby
's
daughter
,
and
clearly
perceiving
the
deep
interest
his
interrogator
took
in
the
matter
,
and
the
favourable
change
that
,
from
some
unknown
cause
,
had
been
wrought
in
his
sentiments
,
the
apprentice
did
not
think
fit
to
hide
anything
from
him
.
<EOS>
Parravicin
's
agitation
increased
as
he
listened
to
the
recital
;
and
at
last
,
overcome
by
emotion
,
he
sank
into
a
chair
,
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
.
<EOS>
Recovering
himself
in
a
short
time
,
he
arose
,
and
began
to
pace
the
chamber
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
I
have
told
you
seems
to
have
disturbed
you
,
Sir
Paul
,
"
remarked
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
the
cause
of
your
agitation
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
man
,
you
may
not
,
"
replied
Parravicin
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
And
then
suddenly
checking
himself
,
he
added
,
with
forced
calmness
,
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
parted
with
Mr.
Thirlby
on
London
Bridge
,
and
you
think
he
will
return
to
Doctor
Hodges
's
residence
in
Watling
-
street
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
it
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
him
without
delay
,
"
rejoined
Parravicin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
you
to
him
,
"
remarked
Leonard
;
"
but
first
I
must
see
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Parravicin
walked
to
a
table
,
on
which
stood
a
small
silver
bell
,
and
ringing
it
,
the
summons
was
immediately
answered
by
an
old
woman
.
<EOS>
He
was
about
to
deliver
a
message
to
her
,
when
the
disturbed
expression
of
her
countenance
struck
him
,
and
he
hastily
inquired
the
cause
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
see
the
young
lady
to
-
night
,
Sir
Paul
,
"
said
the
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
demanded
the
knight
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
--
but
you
frighten
me
so
that
I
dare
not
speak
,
"
was
the
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
frighten
you
still
more
if
you
keep
me
in
this
state
of
suspense
,
"
rejoined
Parravicin
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
Is
she
ill
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
she
has
got
the
plague
,
"
returned
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
Now
you
can
see
her
if
you
think
proper
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
_
I
_
will
see
her
,
"
said
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
fear
of
infection
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
old
woman
looked
hard
at
Parravicin
,
as
if
awaiting
his
orders
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
you
can
take
him
to
her
room
,
"
said
the
knight
,
who
seemed
completely
overpowered
by
the
intelligence
,
"
if
he
chooses
to
go
thither
.
<EOS>
But
why
do
you
suppose
it
is
the
plague
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
One
can
not
well
be
deceived
in
a
seizure
of
that
kind
,
"
replied
the
old
woman
,
shaking
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
the
disorder
never
attacked
the
same
person
twice
,
"
said
Parravicin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
myself
am
an
instance
to
the
contrary
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
,
as
you
have
twice
recovered
,
there
may
be
a
chance
for
Nizza
,
"
said
Parravicin
.
<EOS>
"
This
old
woman
will
take
you
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
will
hasten
to
Doctor
Hodges
's
residence
,
and
if
I
should
fail
in
meeting
him
,
will
not
rest
till
I
procure
assistance
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Do
not
leave
her
till
I
return
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
readily
gave
a
promise
to
the
desired
effect
,
and
accompanying
him
to
the
door
,
told
Rainbird
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
The
latter
agreed
to
wait
below
to
render
any
assistance
that
might
be
required
,
and
went
downstairs
with
Parravicin
and
Chowles
.
<EOS>
The
two
latter
instantly
quitted
the
house
together
,
and
hastened
to
Watling
-
street
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
beating
heart
,
Leonard
then
followed
the
old
woman
to
Nizza
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
They
had
to
pass
through
a
small
anteroom
,
the
door
of
which
was
carefully
locked
.
<EOS>
The
suite
of
apartments
occupied
by
the
captive
girl
were
exquisitely
and
luxuriously
furnished
,
and
formed
a
striking
contrast
to
the
rest
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
air
was
loaded
with
perfumes
;
choice
pictures
adorned
the
walls
;
and
the
tables
were
covered
with
books
and
china
ornaments
.
<EOS>
The
windows
,
however
,
were
strictly
barred
,
and
every
precaution
appeared
to
be
taken
to
prevent
an
attempt
at
escape
.
<EOS>
Leonard
cast
an
anxious
look
round
as
he
entered
the
anteroom
,
and
its
luxurious
air
filled
him
with
anxiety
.
<EOS>
His
conductress
,
however
,
did
not
allow
him
time
for
reflection
,
but
led
him
into
another
room
,
still
more
richly
furnished
than
the
first
,
and
lighted
by
a
large
coloured
lamp
,
that
shed
a
warm
glow
around
it
.
<EOS>
An
old
dwarfed
African
,
in
a
fantastic
dress
,
and
with
a
large
scimetar
stuck
in
his
girdle
,
stepped
forward
on
their
approach
,
and
shook
his
head
significantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
dumb
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
"
but
his
gestures
are
easy
to
be
understood
.
<EOS>
He
means
that
Nizza
is
worse
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
heaved
a
deep
sigh
.
<EOS>
Passing
into
a
third
room
,
they
perceived
the
poor
girl
stretched
on
a
couch
placed
in
a
recess
at
one
side
.
<EOS>
She
heard
their
footsteps
,
and
without
raising
her
head
,
or
looking
towards
them
,
said
,
in
a
weak
but
determined
<EOS>
voice--"Tell
your
master
<EOS>
I
will
see
him
no
more
.
<EOS>
The
plague
has
again
attacked
me
,
and
I
am
glad
of
it
,
for
it
will
deliver
me
from
him
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
useless
to
offer
me
any
remedies
,
for
I
will
not
take
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
,
"
replied
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
brought
a
stranger
,
with
whose
name
I
am
unacquainted
,
to
see
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
have
done
very
wrong
,
"
replied
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
see
no
one
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
even
me
,
Nizza
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Leonard
,
advancing
.
<EOS>
The
poor
girl
started
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
and
raising
herself
on
one
arm
,
looked
wildly
towards
him
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
was
satisfied
that
her
fancy
did
not
deceive
her
,
she
uttered
a
cry
of
delight
,
and
falling
backwards
on
the
couch
,
became
insensible
.
 
<EOS>
Leonard
and
the
old
woman
instantly
flew
to
the
poor
girl
's
assistance
,
and
restoratives
being
applied
,
she
speedily
opened
her
eyes
and
fixed
them
tenderly
and
inquiringly
on
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
Before
replying
to
her
mute
interrogatories
,
Leonard
requested
the
old
woman
to
leave
them
--
an
order
very
reluctantly
obeyed
--
and
as
soon
as
they
were
left
alone
,
proceeded
to
explain
,
as
briefly
as
he
could
,
the
manner
in
which
he
had
discovered
her
place
of
captivity
.
<EOS>
Nizza
listened
to
his
recital
with
the
greatest
interest
,
and
though
evidently
suffering
acute
pain
,
uttered
no
complaint
,
but
endeavoured
to
assume
an
appearance
of
composure
and
tranquillity
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
now
tell
you
all
that
has
befallen
me
since
we
last
met
,
"
she
said
,
as
he
concluded
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
dwell
upon
the
persecution
I
endured
from
the
king
,
whose
passion
increased
in
proportion
to
my
resistance
--
I
will
not
dwell
upon
the
arts
,
the
infamous
arts
,
used
to
induce
me
to
comply
with
his
wishes
--
neither
<EOS>
will
I
dwell
upon
the
desperate
measure
I
had
determined
to
resort
to
,
if
driven
to
the
last
strait
--
nor
would
I
mention
the
subject
at
all
,
except
to
assure
you
I
escaped
contamination
where
few
escaped
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
give
me
any
such
assurance
,
"
remarked
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
While
I
was
thus
almost
driven
to
despair
,
"
pursued
Nizza
,
"
a
young
female
who
attended
me
,
and
affected
to
deplore
my
situation
,
offered
to
help
me
to
escape
.
<EOS>
I
eagerly
embraced
the
offer
;
and
one
night
,
having
purloined
,
as
she
stated
,
the
key
of
the
chamber
in
which
I
was
lodged
,
she
conducted
me
by
a
back
staircase
into
the
palace
-
gardens
.
<EOS>
Thinking
myself
free
,
I
warmly
thanked
my
supposed
deliverer
,
who
hurried
me
towards
a
gate
,
at
which
she
informed
me
a
man
was
waiting
to
guide
me
to
a
cottage
about
a
mile
from
the
city
,
where
I
should
be
in
perfect
safety
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
the
device
,
"
cried
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
why
--
why
did
you
trust
her
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
could
I
do
?
"
rejoined
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
stay
was
as
bad
as
to
fly
,
and
might
have
been
worse
.
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
I
had
no
distrust
.
<EOS>
My
companion
opened
the
gate
,
and
called
to
some
person
without
.
<EOS>
It
was
profoundly
dark
;
but
I
could
perceive
a
carriage
,
or
some
other
vehicle
,
at
a
little
distance
.
<EOS>
Alarmed
at
the
sight
,
I
whispered
my
fears
to
my
companion
,
and
would
have
retreated
;
but
she
laid
hold
of
my
hand
,
and
detained
me
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
I
felt
a
rude
grasp
upon
my
arm
.
<EOS>
Before
I
could
cry
out
,
a
hand
was
placed
over
my
mouth
so
closely
as
almost
to
stifle
me
;
and
I
was
forced
into
the
carriage
by
two
persons
,
who
seated
themselves
on
either
side
of
me
,
threatening
to
put
me
to
death
if
I
made
the
slightest
noise
.
<EOS>
The
carriage
was
then
driven
off
at
a
furious
pace
.
<EOS>
For
some
miles
it
pursued
the
high
road
,
and
then
struck
into
a
lane
,
where
,
in
consequence
of
the
deep
and
dangerous
ruts
,
the
driver
was
obliged
to
relax
his
speed
.
<EOS>
But
in
spite
of
all
his
caution
,
one
of
the
wheels
sunk
into
a
hole
,
and
in
the
efforts
to
extricate
it
,
the
carriage
was
overturned
.
<EOS>
No
injury
was
sustained
either
by
me
or
the
others
inside
,
and
the
door
being
forced
open
without
much
difficulty
,
we
were
let
out
.
<EOS>
One
of
my
captors
kept
near
me
,
while
the
other
lent
his
assistance
to
the
coachman
to
set
the
carriage
to
rights
.
<EOS>
It
proved
,
however
,
to
be
so
much
damaged
,
that
it
could
not
proceed
;
and
,
after
considerable
delay
,
my
conductors
ordered
the
coachman
to
remain
with
it
till
further
assistance
could
be
sent
;
and
,
taking
the
horses
,
one
of
them
,
notwithstanding
my
resistance
,
placed
me
beside
him
,
and
galloped
off
.
<EOS>
Having
ridden
about
five
miles
,
we
crossed
an
extensive
common
,
and
passed
an
avenue
of
trees
,
which
brought
us
to
the
entrance
of
an
old
house
.
<EOS>
Our
arrival
seemed
to
be
expected
;
for
the
instant
we
appeared
,
the
gate
was
opened
,
and
the
old
woman
you
have
just
seen
,
and
who
is
called
Mrs.
Carteret
,
together
with
a
dumb
African
,
named
Hassan
,
appeared
at
it
.
<EOS>
Some
muttered
discourse
passed
between
my
conductors
and
these
persons
,
which
ended
in
my
being
committed
to
the
care
of
Mrs.
Carteret
who
led
me
upstairs
to
a
richly
-
furnished
chamber
,
and
urged
me
to
take
some
refreshment
before
I
retired
to
rest
,
which
,
however
,
I
declined
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Still
,
you
saw
nothing
of
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
?
"
asked
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
going
downstairs
next
morning
,
he
was
the
first
person
I
beheld
,
"
replied
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
Falling
upon
his
knees
,
he
implored
my
pardon
for
the
artifice
he
had
practised
,
and
said
he
had
been
compelled
to
have
recourse
to
it
in
order
to
save
me
from
the
king
.
<EOS>
He
then
began
to
plead
his
own
suit
;
but
finding
his
protestations
of
passion
of
no
effect
,
he
became
yet
more
importunate
;
when
,
at
this
juncture
,
one
of
the
men
who
had
acted
as
my
conductor
on
the
previous
night
suddenly
entered
the
room
,
and
told
him
he
must
return
to
Oxford
without
an
instant
's
delay
,
as
the
king
's
attendants
were
in
search
of
him
.
<EOS>
Casting
a
look
at
me
that
made
me
tremble
,
he
then
departed
;
and
though
I
remained
more
than
two
months
in
that
house
,
I
saw
nothing
more
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
not
attempt
to
escape
during
that
time
?
"
asked
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
so
carefully
watched
by
Mrs.
Carteret
and
Hassan
,
that
it
would
have
been
vain
to
attempt
it
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
About
a
week
ago
,
the
two
men
who
had
conducted
me
to
my
place
of
captivity
,
again
made
their
appearance
,
and
told
me
I
must
accompany
them
to
London
.
<EOS>
I
attempted
no
resistance
,
<EOS>
well
aware
it
would
be
useless
;
and
as
the
journey
was
made
by
by
-
roads
,
three
days
elapsed
before
we
reached
the
capital
.
<EOS>
We
arrived
at
night
,
and
I
almost
forgot
my
own
alarm
in
the
terrible
sights
I
beheld
at
every
turn
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
useless
to
call
out
for
assistance
,
for
there
was
no
one
to
afford
it
.
<EOS>
I
asked
my
conductors
if
they
had
brought
me
there
to
die
,
and
they
answered
,
sternly
,
'
It
depended
on
myself
.
'
<EOS>
At
Ludgate
we
met
Chowles
,
the
coffin
-
maker
,
and
he
brought
us
to
this
house
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
,
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
made
his
appearance
,
and
told
me
he
had
brought
me
hither
to
be
out
of
the
king
's
way
.
<EOS>
He
then
renewed
his
odious
solicitations
.
<EOS>
I
resisted
him
as
firmly
as
before
;
but
he
was
more
determined
;
and
I
might
have
been
reduced
to
the
last
extremity
but
for
your
arrival
,
or
for
the
terrible
disorder
that
has
seized
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
spoken
enough
of
myself
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
what
has
become
of
Amabel
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
,
too
,
has
got
the
plague
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
mournfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
alas
!
"
cried
Nizza
,
bursting
into
tears
;
"
she
is
so
dear
to
you
,
that
I
grieve
for
her
far
more
than
for
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
seen
her
since
I
last
beheld
you
,
"
said
Leonard
,
greatly
touched
by
the
poor
girl
's
devotion
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
carried
off
by
the
Earl
of
Rochester
on
the
same
night
that
you
were
taken
from
Kingston
Lisle
by
the
king
.
"
 
"
And
she
has
been
in
his
power
ever
since
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Nizza
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ever
since
,
"
repeated
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
same
power
that
has
watched
over
me
,
I
trust
has
protected
her
,
"
cried
Nizza
,
fervently
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
doubt
it
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
now
not
be
alive
were
it
otherwise
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
now
something
of
importance
to
disclose
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
remember
the
stranger
we
met
near
the
plague
-
pit
in
Finsbury
Fields
,
and
whose
child
I
buried
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
"
replied
Nizza
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
if
I
tell
you
he
is
your
father
?
"
said
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Nizza
,
in
the
utmost
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
I
,
then
,
been
mistaken
all
these
years
in
supposing
the
piper
to
be
my
father
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
explain
more
to
you
at
present
;
but
a
few
hours
will
reveal
all
.
<EOS>
Thirlby
is
the
name
of
your
father
.
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
heard
it
before
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
returned
Nizza
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
strange
what
you
tell
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
reproached
myself
for
not
feeling
a
stronger
affection
for
the
piper
,
who
always
treated
me
with
the
kindness
of
a
parent
.
<EOS>
But
it
now
seems
the
true
instinct
was
wanting
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
your
reasons
for
supposing
this
person
to
be
my
father
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
Leonard
was
about
to
reply
,
the
door
was
opened
by
Mrs.
Carteret
,
who
said
that
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
had
just
returned
with
Doctor
Hodges
and
another
gentleman
.
<EOS>
The
words
were
scarcely
uttered
,
when
Thirlby
rushed
into
the
room
,
and
,
flinging
himself
on
his
knees
before
the
couch
,
cried
,
"
At
last
<EOS>
I
have
found
you
--
my
child
!
<EOS>
my
child
!
"
<EOS>
The
surprise
which
Nizza
must
have
experienced
at
such
an
address
was
materially
lessened
by
what
Leonard
had
just
told
her
;
and
,
after
earnestly
regarding
the
stranger
for
some
time
,
she
exclaimed
,
in
a
gentle
voice
,
"
My
father
!
"
 
<EOS>
Thirlby
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
would
have
folded
her
in
his
arms
,
if
Doctor
Hodges
,
who
by
this
time
had
reached
the
couch
,
had
not
prevented
him
.
"
<EOS>
Touch
her
not
,
or
you
destroy
yourself
,
"
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
care
not
if
I
do
,
"
rejoined
Thirlby
.
<EOS>
"
The
gratification
would
be
cheaply
purchased
at
the
price
of
my
life
;
and
if
I
could
preserve
hers
by
the
sacrifice
,
I
would
gladly
make
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
more
of
this
,
"
cried
Hodges
,
impatiently
,
"
or
you
will
defeat
any
attempt
I
may
make
to
cure
her
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
not
remain
here
.
<EOS>
Your
presence
agitates
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
Gazing
wistfully
at
his
daughter
,
and
scarcely
able
to
tear
himself
away
,
Thirlby
yielded
at
last
to
the
doctor
's
advice
,
and
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
was
followed
by
Leonard
,
who
received
a
hint
to
the
same
effect
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
adjoining
room
,
they
found
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
walking
to
and
fro
in
an
agitated
manner
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
came
up
to
Thirlby
,
and
,
in
an
anxious
but
deferential
tone
,
inquired
how
he
had
found
Nizza
?
<EOS>
The
latter
shook
his
head
,
and
,
sternly
declining
any
further
conversation
,
passed
on
with
the
apprentice
to
an
outer
room
.
<EOS>
He
then
flung
himself
into
a
chair
,
and
appeared
lost
in
deep
and
bitter
reflection
.
<EOS>
Leonard
was
unwilling
to
disturb
him
;
but
at
last
his
own
anxieties
compelled
him
to
break
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
tell
me
aught
of
Amabel
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
no
,
"
replied
Thirlby
,
rousing
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
no
time
to
inquire
about
her
,
as
you
shall
hear
.
<EOS>
After
leaving
you
on
the
bridge
,
I
went
into
Southwark
,
and
hurrying
through
all
the
principal
streets
,
inquired
from
every
watchman
I
met
whether
he
had
seen
any
person
answering
to
Doctor
Hodges
's
description
,
but
could
hear
nothing
of
him
.
<EOS>
At
last
I
gave
up
the
quest
,
and
,
retracing
my
steps
,
was
proceeding
along
Cannon
-
street
,
when
I
descried
a
person
a
little
in
advance
of
me
,
whom
I
thought
must
be
the
doctor
,
and
,
calling
out
to
him
,
found
I
was
not
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
had
just
reached
him
,
when
two
other
persons
turned
the
corner
of
Nicholas
-
lane
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
us
,
one
of
them
ran
up
to
the
doctor
,
exclaiming
,
'
By
Heaven
,
the
very
person
I
want
!
'
<EOS>
It
was
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
;
and
he
instantly
explained
his
errand
.
<EOS>
Imagine
the
feelings
with
which
I
heard
his
account
of
the
illness
of
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
Imagine
,
also
,
the
horror
I
must
have
experienced
in
recognising
in
her
persecutor
my--
"
 
<EOS>
The
sentence
was
not
completed
,
for
at
that
moment
the
door
was
opened
by
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
,
who
,
advancing
towards
Thirlby
,
begged
,
in
the
same
deferential
tone
as
before
,
to
have
a
few
words
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
might
well
refuse
you
,
"
replied
Thirlby
,
sternly
,
"
but
it
is
necessary
we
should
have
some
explanation
of
what
has
occurred
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
rejoined
Parravicin
,
"
and
,
therefore
,
I
have
sought
you
.
"
<EOS>
Thirlby
arose
,
and
accompanied
the
knight
into
the
outer
room
,
closing
the
door
after
him
.
<EOS>
More
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
--
it
seemed
an
age
to
Leonard
--
elapsed
,
and
still
no
one
came
.
<EOS>
Listening
intently
,
he
heard
voices
in
the
next
room
.
<EOS>
They
were
loud
and
angry
,
as
if
in
quarrel
.
<EOS>
Then
all
was
quiet
,
and
at
last
Thirlby
reappeared
,
and
took
his
seat
beside
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
seen
Doctor
Hodges
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
apprentice
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
replied
<EOS>
Thirlby--"and
he
speaks
favourably
of
my
poor
child
.
<EOS>
He
has
administered
all
needful
remedies
,
but
as
it
is
necessary
to
watch
their
effect
,
he
will
remain
with
her
some
time
longer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
,
meanwhile
,
I
shall
know
nothing
of
Amabel
,
"
cried
Leonard
,
in
a
tone
of
bitter
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
anxiety
is
natural
,
"
returned
Thirlby
,
"
but
you
may
rest
satisfied
,
if
Doctor
Hodges
has
seen
her
,
he
has
done
all
that
human
aid
can
effect
.
<EOS>
But
as
you
must
perforce
wait
his
coming
forth
,
I
will
endeavour
to
beguile
the
tedious
interval
by
relating
to
you
so
much
of
my
history
as
refers
to
Nizza
Macascree
.
"
 
<EOS>
After
a
brief
pause
,
he
commenced
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
,
then
,
that
in
my
youth
I
became
desperately
enamoured
of
a
lady
named
Isabella
Morley
.
<EOS>
She
was
most
beautiful
--
but
I
need
not
enlarge
upon
her
attractions
,
since
you
have
beheld
her
very
image
in
Nizza
.
<EOS>
When
I
first
met
her
she
was
attached
to
another
,
but
I
soon
rid
myself
of
my
rival
.
<EOS>
I
quarrelled
with
him
,
and
slew
him
in
a
duel
.
<EOS>
After
a
long
and
urgent
suit
,
for
the
successful
issue
of
which
I
was
mainly
indebted
to
my
rank
and
wealth
,
which
gave
great
influence
with
her
parents
,
Isabella
became
mine
.
<EOS>
But
I
soon
found
out
she
did
not
love
me
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
discovery
,
I
became
madly
jealous
,
and
embittered
her
life
and
my
own
by
constant
,
and
,
now
I
know
too
well
,
groundless
suspicions
.
<EOS>
She
had
borne
me
a
son
,
and
in
the
excess
of
my
jealous
fury
,
fancying
the
child
was
not
my
own
,
I
threatened
to
put
it
to
death
.
<EOS>
This
violence
led
to
the
unhappy
result
I
am
about
to
relate
.
<EOS>
Another
child
was
born
,
a
daughter
--
need
I
say
Nizza
,
or
to
give
her
her
proper
name
,
Isabella
,
for
she
was
so
christened
after
her
mother
--
and
<EOS>
one
night
--
one
luckless
night,--maddened
by
some
causeless
doubt
,
I
snatched
the
innocent
babe
from
her
mother
's
arms
,
and
if
I
had
not
been
prevented
by
the
attendants
,
who
rushed
into
the
room
on
hearing
their
mistress
's
shrieks
,
should
have
destroyed
her
.
<EOS>
After
awhile
,
I
became
pacified
,
and
on
reviewing
my
conduct
more
calmly
on
the
morrow
,
bitterly
reproached
myself
,
and
hastened
to
express
my
penitence
to
my
wife
.
'
<EOS>
You
will
never
have
an
opportunity
of
repeating
your
violence
,
'
she
said
;
'
the
object
of
your
cruel
and
unfounded
suspicions
is
gone
.
<EOS>
'--'Gone
!
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
;
'
whither
?
'
<EOS>
And
as
I
spoke
I
looked
around
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
But
the
babe
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
my
inquiries
,
my
wife
admitted
that
she
had
caused
her
to
be
removed
to
a
place
of
safety
,
but
refused
,
even
on
my
most
urgent
entreaties
,
accompanied
by
promises
of
amended
conduct
,
to
tell
me
where
.
<EOS>
I
next
interrogated
the
servants
,
but
they
professed
entire
ignorance
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
For
three
whole
days
I
made
ineffectual
search
for
the
child
,
and
offered
large
rewards
to
any
one
who
would
bring
her
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
they
failed
to
produce
her
;
and
repairing
to
my
wife
's
chamber
,
I
threatened
her
with
the
most
terrible
consequences
if
she
persisted
in
her
vindictive
project
.
<EOS>
She
defied
me
,
and
,
transported
with
rage
<EOS>
,
I
passed
my
sword
through
her
body
,
exclaiming
as
I
dealt
the
murderous
blow
,
'
You
have
sent
the
brat
to
her
father
--
to
your
lover
,
madam
.
'
<EOS>
Horror
and
remorse
seized
me
the
moment
I
had
committed
the
ruthless
act
,
and
I
should
have
turned
my
sword
against
myself
,
if
I
had
not
been
stayed
by
the
cry
of
my
poor
victim
,
who
implored
me
to
hold
my
hand
.
'
<EOS>
Do
not
add
crime
to
crime
,
'
she
cried
;
'
you
have
done
me
grievous
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
,
indeed
,
loved
you
,
because
my
affections
were
not
under
my
control
,
but
I
have
been
ever
true
to
you
,
and
this
I
declare
with
my
latest
breath
.
<EOS>
I
freely
forgive
you
,
and
pray
God
to
turn
your
heart
.
'
<EOS>
And
with
these
words
she
expired
.
<EOS>
I
was
roused
from
the
stupefaction
into
which
I
was
thrown
by
the
appearance
of
the
servants
.
<EOS>
Heaping
execrations
upon
me
,
they
strove
to
seize
me
;
but
I
broke
through
them
,
and
gained
a
garden
at
the
back
of
my
mansion
,
which
was
situated
on
the
bank
of
the
Thames
,
not
far
from
Chelsea
.
<EOS>
This
garden
ran
down
to
the
river
side
,
and
was
defended
by
a
low
wall
,
which
I
leapt
,
and
plunged
into
the
stream
.
<EOS>
A
boat
was
instantly
sent
in
pursuit
of
me
,
and
a
number
of
persons
ran
along
the
banks
,
all
eager
for
my
capture
.
<EOS>
But
being
an
excellent
swimmer
,
I
tried
to
elude
them
,
and
as
I
never
appeared
again
,
it
was
supposed
I
was
drowned
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
Nizza
,
or
as
I
ought
now
to
call
her
,
Isabella
,
was
confided
,
I
suppose
,
to
the
piper
?
"
inquired
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
was
confided
to
his
helpmate
,
"
replied
Thirlby
,
"
who
had
been
nurse
to
my
wife
.
<EOS>
Mike
Macascree
was
one
of
my
father
's
servants
,
and
was
in
his
younger
days
a
merry
,
worthless
fellow
.
<EOS>
The
heavy
calamity
under
which
he
now
labours
had
not
then
befallen
him
.
<EOS>
On
taking
charge
of
my
daughter
,
his
wife
received
certain
papers
substantiating
the
child
's
origin
,
together
with
a
miniature
,
and
a
small
golden
amulet
.
<EOS>
The
papers
and
miniature
were
delivered
by
her
on
her
death
-
bed
to
the
piper
,
who
showed
them
to
me
to
-
night
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
the
amulet
I
myself
have
seen
,
"
remarked
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
resume
my
own
history
,
"
said
Thirlby--"after
<EOS>
the
dreadful
catastrophe
I
have
related
,
I
remained
concealed
in
London
for
some
months
,
and
was
glad
to
find
the
report
of
my
death
generally
believed
.
<EOS>
I
then
passed
over
into
Holland
,
where
I
resided
for
several
years
,
in
the
course
of
which
time
I
married
the
widow
of
a
rich
merchant
,
who
died
soon
after
our
union
,
leaving
me
one
child
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
to
hide
his
emotion
.
<EOS>
After
awhile
he
proceeded
:
 
"
Having
passed
many
years
,
as
peacefully
as
one
whose
conscience
was
so
heavily
burdened
as
mine
could
hope
to
pass
them
,
in
Amsterdam
,
I
last
summer
brought
my
daughter
,
around
whom
my
affections
were
closely
twined
,
to
London
,
and
took
up
my
abode
in
the
eastern
environs
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
There
again
I
was
happy
--
<EOS>
too
happy!--until
at
last
the
plague
came
.
<EOS>
But
why
should
I
relate
the
rest
of
my
sad
story
?
<EOS>
"
he
added
,
in
a
voice
suffocated
with
emotion--"you
know
it
as
well
as
I
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
said
you
had
a
son
,
"
observed
Leonard
,
after
a
pause--"Is
he
yet
living
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
,
"
replied
Thirlby
,
a
shade
passing
over
his
countenance
.
"
<EOS>
On
my
return
to
England
I
communicated
to
him
through
Judith
Malmayns
,
who
is
my
foster
-
sister
,
that
I
was
still
alive
,
telling
him
the
name
I
had
adopted
,
and
adding
,
I
should
never
disturb
him
in
the
possession
of
his
title
and
estates
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Title
!
"
exclaimed
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
title
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Thirlby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
title
I
once
bore
was
that
of
Lord
Argentine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
said
Leonard
,
"
for
I
began
to
fear
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
was
your
son
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Paul
Parravicin
,
or
,
rather
,
the
Lord
Argentine
,
for
such
is
his
rightful
title
,
_
is
_
my
son
,
"
returned
Thirlby
;
"
and
I
lament
to
own
<EOS>
I
am
his
father
.
<EOS>
When
among
his
worthless
associates,--nay
,
even
with
the
king
--
he
drops
the
higher
title
,
and
assumes
that
by
which
you
have
known
him
;
and
it
is
well
he
does
so
,
for
his
actions
are
sufficient
to
tarnish
a
far
nobler
name
than
that
he
bears
.
<EOS>
Owing
to
this
disguise
I
knew
not
he
was
the
person
who
carried
off
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
But
,
thank
Heaven
,
another
and
fouler
crime
has
been
spared
us
.
<EOS>
All
these
things
have
been
strangely
explained
to
me
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
And
thus
,
you
see
,
young
man
,
the
poor
piper
's
daughter
turns
out
to
be
the
Lady
Isabella
Argentine
.
<EOS>
"
Before
an
answer
could
be
returned
,
the
door
was
opened
by
Hodges
,
and
both
starting
to
their
feet
,
hurried
towards
him
.

<EOS>
THE
TRIALS
OF
AMABEL
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
now
be
necessary
to
return
to
the
period
of
Amabel
's
abduction
from
Kingston
Lisle
.
<EOS>
The
shawl
thrown
over
her
head
prevented
her
cries
from
being
heard
;
and
,
notwithstanding
her
struggles
,
she
was
placed
on
horseback
before
a
powerful
man
,
who
galloped
off
with
her
along
the
Wantage
-
road
.
<EOS>
After
proceeding
at
a
rapid
pace
for
about
two
miles
,
her
conductor
came
to
a
halt
,
and
she
could
distinguish
the
sound
of
other
horsemen
approaching
.
<EOS>
At
first
she
hoped
it
might
prove
a
rescue
;
but
she
was
quickly
undeceived
.
<EOS>
The
shawl
was
removed
,
and
she
beheld
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
accompanied
by
Pillichody
,
and
some
half
-
dozen
mounted
attendants
.
<EOS>
The
earl
would
have
transferred
her
to
his
own
steed
,
but
she
offered
such
determined
resistance
to
the
arrangement
,
that
he
was
compelled
to
content
himself
with
riding
by
her
aide
.
<EOS>
All
his
efforts
to
engage
her
in
conversation
were
equally
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
She
made
no
reply
to
his
remarks
,
but
averted
her
gaze
from
him
;
and
,
whenever
he
approached
,
shrank
from
him
with
abhorrence
.
<EOS>
The
earl
,
however
,
was
not
easily
repulsed
,
but
continued
his
attentions
and
discourse
,
as
if
both
had
been
favourably
received
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
way
they
proceeded
for
some
miles
,
one
of
the
earl
's
attendants
,
who
was
well
acquainted
with
the
country
,
being
in
fact
a
native
of
it
,
serving
as
their
guide
.
<EOS>
They
had
quitted
the
Wantage
-
road
,
and
leaving
that
ancient
town
,
renowned
as
the
birthplace
of
the
great
Alfred
,
on
the
right
,
had
taken
the
direction
of
Abingdon
and
Oxford
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
lovely
evening
,
and
their
course
led
them
through
many
charming
places
.
<EOS>
But
the
dreariest
waste
would
have
been
as
agreeable
as
the
richest
prospect
to
Amabel
.
<EOS>
She
noted
neither
the
broad
meadows
,
yet
white
from
the
scythe
,
nor
the
cornfields
waving
with
their
deep
and
abundant
,
though
yet
immature
crops
;
nor
did
she
cast
even
a
passing
glance
at
any
one
of
those
green
spots
which
every
lane
offers
,
and
upon
which
the
eye
of
the
traveller
ordinarily
delights
to
linger
.
<EOS>
She
rode
beneath
a
natural
avenue
of
trees
,
whose
branches
met
overhead
like
the
arches
of
a
cathedral
,
and
was
scarcely
conscious
of
their
pleasant
shade
.
<EOS>
She
heard
neither
the
song
of
the
wooing
thrush
,
nor
the
cry
of
the
startled
blackbird
,
nor
the
evening
hymn
of
the
soaring
lark
.
<EOS>
Alike
to
her
was
the
gorse
-
covered
common
,
along
which
they
swiftly
speeded
,
and
the
steep
hill
-
side
up
which
they
more
swiftly
mounted
.
<EOS>
She
breathed
not
the
delicious
fragrance
of
the
new
-
mown
hay
,
nor
listened
to
the
distant
lowing
herds
,
the
bleating
sheep
,
or
the
cawing
rooks
.
<EOS>
She
thought
of
nothing
but
her
perilous
situation,--heard
nothing
but
the
voice
of
Rochester,--felt
nothing
but
the
terror
inspired
by
his
presence
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
earl
did
not
desire
to
pass
through
any
village
,
if
he
could
help
it
,
his
guide
led
him
along
the
most
unfrequented
roads
;
but
in
spite
of
his
caution
,
an
interruption
occurred
which
had
nearly
resulted
in
Amabel
's
deliverance
.
<EOS>
While
threading
a
narrow
lane
,
they
came
suddenly
upon
a
troop
of
haymakers
,
in
a
field
on
the
right
,
who
,
up
to
that
moment
,
had
been
hidden
from
view
by
the
high
hedges
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
them
,
Amabel
screamed
loudly
for
assistance
,
and
was
instantly
answered
by
their
shouts
.
<EOS>
Rochester
ordered
his
men
to
gallop
forward
,
but
the
road
winding
round
the
meadow
,
the
haymakers
were
enabled
to
take
a
shorter
cut
and
intercept
them
.
<EOS>
Leaping
the
hedge
,
a
stout
fellow
rushed
towards
Amabel
's
conductor
,
and
seized
the
bridle
of
his
steed
.
<EOS>
He
was
followed
by
two
others
,
who
would
have
instantly
liberated
the
captive
girl
,
if
the
earl
had
not
,
with
great
presence
of
mind
,
cried
out
,
"
Touch
her
not
,
as
you
value
your
lives
!
<EOS>
She
is
ill
of
the
plague
!
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
formidable
announcement
,
which
operated
like
magic
upon
Amabel
's
defenders
,
and
made
them
fall
back
more
quickly
than
the
weapons
of
the
earl
's
attendants
could
have
done
,
they
retreated
,
and
communicating
their
fears
to
their
comrades
,
who
were
breaking
through
the
hedge
in
all
directions
,
and
hurrying
to
their
aid
,
the
whole
band
took
to
their
heels
,
and
,
regardless
of
Amabel
's
continued
shrieks
,
never
stopped
till
they
supposed
themselves
out
of
the
reach
of
infection
.
<EOS>
The
earl
was
thus
at
liberty
to
pursue
his
way
unmolested
,
and
laughing
heartily
at
the
success
of
his
stratagem
,
and
at
the
consternation
he
had
created
among
the
haymakers
,
pressed
forward
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
further
occurred
till
,
in
crossing
the
little
river
Ock
,
near
Lyford
,
the
horse
ridden
by
Amabel
's
conductor
missed
its
footing
,
and
precipitated
them
both
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
No
ill
consequences
followed
the
accident
.
<EOS>
Throwing
himself
into
the
shallow
stream
,
Rochester
seized
Amabel
,
and
placed
her
beside
him
on
his
own
steed
.
<EOS>
A
deathly
paleness
overspread
her
countenance
,
and
a
convulsion
shook
her
frame
as
she
was
thus
brought
into
contact
with
the
earl
,
who
,
fearing
the
immersion
might
prove
dangerous
in
her
present
delicate
state
of
health
,
quickened
his
pace
to
procure
assistance
.
<EOS>
Before
he
had
proceeded
a
hundred
yards
,
Amabel
fainted
.
<EOS>
Gazing
at
her
with
admiration
,
and
pressing
her
inanimate
frame
to
his
breast
,
Rochester
imprinted
a
passionate
kiss
on
her
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
my
soul
!
"
he
mentally
ejaculated
,
"
I
never
thought
I
could
be
so
desperately
enamoured
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
part
with
her
for
the
crown
of
these
realms
.
"
 
<EOS>
While
considering
whither
he
should
take
her
,
and
much
alarmed
at
her
situation
,
the
man
who
acted
as
guide
came
to
his
relief
.
<EOS>
Halting
till
the
earl
came
up
,
he
said
,
"
If
you
want
assistance
for
the
young
lady
,
my
lord
,
I
can
take
you
to
a
good
country
<EOS>
inn
,
not
far
from
this
,
where
she
will
be
well
attended
to
,
and
where
,
as
it
is
kept
by
my
father
,
I
can
answer
that
no
questions
will
be
asked
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Precisely
what
I
wish
,
Sherborne
,
"
replied
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
halt
there
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
Ride
on
as
fast
as
you
can
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sherborne
struck
spurs
into
his
steed
,
and
passing
Kingston
Bagpuze
,
reached
the
high
road
between
Abingdon
and
Faringdon
,
at
the
corner
of
which
stood
the
inn
in
question,--a
good
-
sized
habitation
,
with
large
stables
and
a
barn
attached
to
it
.
<EOS>
Here
he
halted
,
and
calling
out
in
a
loud
and
authoritative
voice
,
the
landlord
instantly
answered
the
summons
;
and
,
on
being
informed
by
his
son
of
the
rank
of
his
guest
,
doffed
his
cap
,
and
hastened
to
assist
the
earl
to
dismount
.
<EOS>
But
Rochester
declined
his
services
,
and
bidding
him
summon
his
wife
,
she
shortly
afterwards
made
her
appearance
in
the
shape
of
a
stout
middle
-
aged
dame
.
<EOS>
Committing
Amabel
to
her
care
,
the
earl
then
alighted
,
and
followed
them
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
Plough
,
for
so
the
inn
was
denominated
,
was
thrown
into
the
utmost
confusion
by
the
arrival
of
the
earl
and
his
suite
.
<EOS>
All
the
ordinary
frequenters
of
the
inn
were
ejected
,
while
the
best
parlour
was
instantly
prepared
for
the
accommodation
of
his
lordship
and
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
But
Rochester
was
far
more
anxious
for
Amabel
than
himself
,
and
could
not
rest
for
a
moment
till
assured
by
Dame
Sherborne
that
she
was
restored
to
sensibility
,
and
about
to
retire
to
rest
.
<EOS>
He
then
became
easy
,
and
sat
down
to
supper
with
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
So
elated
was
he
by
his
success
,
that
,
yielding
to
his
natural
inclination
for
hard
drinking
,
he
continued
to
revel
so
freely
and
so
long
with
his
follower
<EOS>
,
that
daybreak
found
them
over
their
wine
,
the
one
toasting
the
grocer
's
daughter
,
and
the
other
Patience
,
when
they
both
staggered
off
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
A
couple
of
hours
sufficed
Rochester
to
sleep
off
the
effects
of
his
carouse
.
<EOS>
At
six
o'clock
he
arose
,
and
ordered
his
attendants
to
prepare
to
set
out
without
delay
.
<EOS>
When
all
was
ready
,
he
sent
for
Amabel
,
but
she
refused
to
come
downstairs
,
and
finding
his
repeated
messages
of
no
avail
,
he
rushed
into
her
room
,
and
bore
her
,
shrieking
to
his
steed
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
hour
after
this
,
they
arrived
at
an
old
hall
,
belonging
to
the
earl
,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Oxford
.
<EOS>
Amabel
was
entrusted
to
the
care
of
a
female
attendant
,
named
Prudence
,
and
towards
evening
,
Rochester
,
who
was
burning
with
impatience
for
an
interview
,
learnt
,
to
his
infinite
disappointment
,
that
she
was
so
seriously
unwell
,
that
if
he
forced
himself
into
her
presence
,
her
life
might
be
placed
in
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
She
continued
in
the
same
state
for
several
days
,
at
the
end
of
which
time
,
the
chirurgeon
who
attended
her
,
and
who
was
a
creature
of
the
earl
's
,
pronounced
her
out
of
danger
.
<EOS>
Rochester
then
sent
her
word
by
Prudence
that
he
must
see
her
in
the
course
of
that
day
,
and
a
few
hours
after
the
delivery
of
the
message
,
he
sought
her
room
.
<EOS>
She
was
much
enfeebled
by
illness
,
but
received
him
with
great
self
-
possession
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
believe
,
my
lord
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
you
desire
to
destroy
me
,
and
when
I
assure
you
--
solemnly
assure
you
,
that
if
you
continue
to
persecute
me
thus
,
my
death
,
will
be
the
consequence
<EOS>
,
I
am
persuaded
you
will
desist
,
and
suffer
me
to
depart
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Amabel
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
,
passionately
,
"
is
it
possible
you
can
be
so
changed
towards
me
?
<EOS>
Nothing
now
interferes
to
prevent
our
union
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Except
my
own
determination
to
the
contrary
,
my
lord
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
never
be
yours
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wherefore
not
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
earl
,
half
angrily
,
half
reproachfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
I
know
and
feel
that
I
should
condemn
myself
to
wretchedness
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Because
--
for
since
your
lordship
will
force
the
truth
from
me
,
I
must
speak
out
--
I
have
learnt
to
regard
your
character
in
its
true
light,--and
because
my
heart
is
wedded
to
heaven
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pshaw
!
"
exclaimed
the
earl
,
contemptuously
;
"
you
have
been
listening
so
long
to
your
saintly
father
's
discourses
,
that
you
fancy
them
applicable
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
mistaken
in
me
,
"
he
added
,
altering
his
tone
;
"
I
see
where
the
main
difficulty
lies
.
<EOS>
You
think
I
am
about
to
delude
you
,
as
before
,
into
a
mock
marriage
.
<EOS>
But
I
swear
to
you
you
are
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
love
you
so
well
that
I
would
risk
my
temporal
and
eternal
happiness
for
you
.
<EOS>
It
will
rejoice
me
to
raise
you
to
my
own
rank
--
to
place
you
among
the
radiant
beauties
of
our
sovereign
's
court
,
the
brightest
of
whom
you
will
outshine
,
and
to
devote
my
whole
life
to
your
happiness
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
late
,
"
sighed
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
too
late
?
"
cried
the
earl
,
imploringly
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
gone
through
severe
trials
,
it
is
true
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
constantly
baffled
in
my
pursuit
of
you
,
but
disappointment
has
only
made
me
love
you
more
devotedly
.
<EOS>
Why
too
late
?
<EOS>
What
is
to
prevent
our
nuptials
from
taking
place
to
-
day
--
to
-
morrow
--
when
you
will
?
<EOS>
The
king
himself
shall
be
present
at
the
ceremony
,
and
shall
give
you
away
.
<EOS>
Will
this
satisfy
your
scruples
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
have
offended
you
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
deserve
your
anger
.
<EOS>
But
the
love
that
prompted
me
to
act
thus
,
must
also
plead
my
pardon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Strengthen
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
murmured
,
looking
supplicatingly
upwards
.
"
<EOS>
Strengthen
me
,
for
my
trial
is
very
severe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
not
deceived
,
Amabel
,
"
continued
Rochester
,
yet
more
ardently
;
"
that
you
love
me
<EOS>
I
am
well
assured
,
however
strongly
you
may
at
this
moment
persuade
yourself
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
Be
not
governed
by
your
father
's
strait
-
laced
and
puritanical
opinions
.
<EOS>
Men
,
such
as
he
is
,
can
not
judge
of
fiery
natures
like
mine
.
<EOS>
I
myself
have
had
to
conquer
a
stubborn
and
rebellious
spirit,--the
demon
pride
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
conquered
.
<EOS>
Love
has
achieved
the
victory,--love
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
offer
you
my
heart
,
my
hand
,
my
title
.
<EOS>
A
haughty
noble
makes
this
offer
to
a
grocer
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
Can
you
--
will
you
refuse
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
and
do
,
my
lord
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
achieved
a
yet
harder
victory
.
<EOS>
With
me
,
principle
has
conquered
love
.
<EOS>
I
no
longer
respect
you
,
no
longer
love
you
--
and
,
therefore
,
can
not
we
d
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Rash
and
obstinate
girl
,
"
cried
the
earl
,
unable
to
conceal
his
mortification
;
"
you
will
bitterly
repent
your
inconsiderate
conduct
.
<EOS>
I
offer
you
devotion
such
as
no
other
person
could
offer
you
,
and
rank
such
as
no
other
is
likely
to
offer
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
now
in
my
power
,
and
you
_
shall
_
be
mine,--in
<EOS>
what
way
rests
with
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
a
week
to
consider
the
matter
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
that
time
,
I
will
again
renew
my
proposal
.
<EOS>
If
you
accept
it
,
well
and
good
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
you
know
the
alternative
.
"
<EOS>
And
without
waiting
for
a
reply
,
he
quitted
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
as
good
as
his
word
.
<EOS>
During
the
whole
of
the
week
allowed
Amabel
for
consideration
,
he
never
intruded
upon
her
,
nor
was
his
name
at
any
time
mentioned
by
her
attendants
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
been
,
indeed
,
Countess
of
Rochester
,
she
could
not
have
been
treated
with
greater
respect
than
was
shown
her
.
<EOS>
The
apartment
allotted
her
opened
upon
a
large
garden
,
surrounded
by
high
walls
,
and
she
walked
within
it
daily
.
<EOS>
Her
serenity
of
mind
remained
undisturbed
;
her
health
visibly
improved
;
and
,
what
was
yet
more
surprising
,
she
entirely
recovered
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
her
time
not
devoted
to
exercise
,
was
spent
in
reading
,
or
in
prayer
.
<EOS>
On
the
appointed
day
,
Rochester
presented
himself
.
<EOS>
She
received
him
with
the
most
perfect
composure
,
and
with
a
bland
look
,
from
which
he
augured
favourably
.
<EOS>
He
waved
his
hand
to
the
attendants
,
and
they
were
alone
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
came
for
your
answer
,
Amabel
,
"
he
said
;
"
but
I
scarcely
require
it
,
being
convinced
from
your
looks
that
I
have
nothing
to
fear
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
why
did
you
not
abridge
this
tedious
interval
?
<EOS>
Why
not
inform
me
you
had
altered
your
mind
?
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
reproach
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
too
happy
to
complain
of
the
delay
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
undeceive
you
,
my
lord
,
"
returned
Amabel
,
gravely
.
"
<EOS>
No
change
has
taken
place
in
my
feelings
.
<EOS>
I
still
adhere
to
the
resolution
I
had
come
to
when
we
last
parted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
!
"
exclaimed
the
earl
,
his
countenance
darkening
,
and
the
evil
look
which
Amabel
had
before
noticed
taking
possession
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
One
moment
lured
on
,
and
next
rebuffed
.
<EOS>
But
no
--
no
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
constraining
himself
,
"
you
can
not
mean
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
in
woman
's
nature
to
act
thus
.
<EOS>
You
have
loved
me
--
you
love
me
still
.
<EOS>
Make
me
happy
--
make
yourself
happy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
she
replied
,
"
strange
and
unnatural
as
my
conduct
may
appear
,
you
will
find
it
consistent
.
<EOS>
You
have
lost
the
sway
you
had
once
over
me
,
and
,
for
the
reasons
I
have
already
given
you
,
I
can
never
be
yours
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
recall
your
words
,
Amabel
,
"
he
cried
,
in
the
most
moving
tones
he
could
command
;
"
if
you
have
no
regard
for
me
--
at
least
have
compassion
.
<EOS>
I
will
quit
the
court
if
you
desire
it
;
will
abandon
title
,
rank
,
wealth
;
and
live
in
the
humblest
station
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
know
not
what
I
am
capable
of
when
under
the
dominion
of
passion
.
<EOS>
I
am
capable
of
the
darkest
crimes
,
or
of
the
brightest
virtues
.
<EOS>
The
woman
who
has
a
man
's
heart
in
her
power
may
mould
it
to
her
own
purposes
,
be
they
good
or
ill
.
<EOS>
Reject
me
,
and
you
drive
me
to
despair
,
and
plunge
me
into
guilt
.
<EOS>
Accept
me
,
and
you
may
lead
me
into
any
course
,
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Were
I
assured
of
this--
"
cried
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rest
assured
of
it
,
"
returned
the
earl
,
passionately
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yield
to
impulses
of
natural
affection
,
and
do
not
suffer
a
cold
and
calculating
creed
to
chill
your
better
feelings
.
<EOS>
How
many
a
warm
and
loving
heart
has
been
so
frozen
!
<EOS>
Do
not
let
yours
be
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
Be
mine
!
<EOS>
be
mine
!
"
 
<EOS>
Amabel
looked
at
him
earnestly
for
a
moment
;
while
he
,
assured
that
he
had
gained
his
point
,
could
not
conceal
a
slightly
triumphant
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
your
answer
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
My
life
hangs
upon
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
still
unmoved
,
"
she
replied
,
coldly
,
and
firmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
earl
with
a
terrible
imprecation
,
and
starting
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
"
You
refuse
me
.
<EOS>
Be
it
so
.
<EOS>
But
think
not
that
you
shall
escape
me
.
<EOS>
No
,
you
are
in
my
power
,
and
I
will
use
it
.
<EOS>
You
shall
be
mine
and
without
the
priest
's
interference
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
degrade
myself
by
an
alliance
with
one
so
lowly
born
.
<EOS>
The
strongest
love
is
nearest
allied
to
hatred
,
and
mine
has
become
hatred
--
bitter
hatred
.
<EOS>
You
shall
be
mine
,
I
tell
you
,
and
when
I
am
indifferent
to
you
,
I
will
cast
you
off
.
<EOS>
Then
,
when
you
are
neglected
,
despised
,
shunned
,
you
will
regret
--
deeply
but
unavailingly
--
your
rejection
of
my
proposals
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
lord
,
I
shall
never
regret
it
,
"
replied
Amabel
,
"
and
I
can
not
sufficiently
rejoice
that
I
did
not
yield
to
the
momentary
weakness
that
inclined
me
to
accept
them
.
<EOS>
I
thank
you
for
the
insight
you
have
afforded
me
into
your
character
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
formed
an
erroneous
opinion
of
me
,
Amabel
,
"
cried
the
earl
,
seeing
his
error
,
and
trying
to
correct
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
well
nigh
distracted
by
conflicting
emotions
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
forgive
my
violence
--
forget
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Readily
,
"
she
replied
;
"
but
think
not
I
attach
the
least
credit
to
your
professions
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Away
,
then
,
with
further
disguise
,
"
returned
the
earl
,
relapsing
into
his
furious
mood
,
"
and
recognise
in
me
the
person
I
am
--
or
,
rather
the
person
you
would
have
me
be
.
<EOS>
You
say
you
are
immovable
.
<EOS>
So
am
I
;
nor
will
I
further
delay
my
purpose
.
"
 
<EOS>
Amabel
,
who
had
watched
him
uneasily
during
this
speech
,
retreated
a
step
,
and
taking
a
small
dagger
from
a
handkerchief
in
which
she
kept
it
concealed
,
placed
its
point
against
her
breast
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
well
know
whom
I
have
to
deal
with
,
my
lord
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
am
,
therefore
,
provided
against
the
last
extremity
.
<EOS>
Attempt
to
touch
me
,
and
I
plunge
this
dagger
into
my
heart
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
sense
of
religion
will
not
allow
you
to
commit
so
desperate
a
deed
,
"
replied
the
earl
,
derisively
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
blood
be
upon
your
head
,
my
lord
,
<EOS>
"
she
rejoined
;
"
for
it
is
your
hand
that
strikes
the
blow
,
and
not
my
own
.
<EOS>
My
honour
is
dearer
to
me
than
life
,
and
I
will
unhesitatingly
sacrifice
the
one
to
preserve
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
fear
but
that
the
action
,
wrongful
though
it
be
,
will
be
forgiven
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
earl
,
seeing
from
her
determined
look
and
manner
that
she
would
unquestionably
execute
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
desire
to
drive
you
to
destruction
.
<EOS>
Think
over
what
I
have
said
to
you
,
and
we
will
renew
the
subject
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Renew
it
when
you
please
,
my
lord
,
my
answer
will
still
be
the
same
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
but
one
refuge
from
you
--
the
grave
--
and
thither
,
if
need
be
,
I
will
fly
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
she
spoke
,
she
moved
slowly
towards
the
adjoining
chamber
,
the
door
of
which
she
fastened
after
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
had
some
experience
of
her
sex
,
"
said
Rochester
to
himself
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
find
I
was
mistaken
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
's
mood
,
however
,
may
be
unlike
to
-
day
's
.
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
I
must
take
my
measures
differently
.

V.
 
<EOS>
THE
MARRIAGE
AND
ITS
CONSEQUENCES
.
 
<EOS>
Unwilling
to
believe
he
had
become
an
object
of
aversion
to
Amabel
,
Rochester
renewed
his
solicitations
on
the
following
day
,
and
calling
into
play
his
utmost
fascination
of
manner
,
endeavoured
to
remove
any
ill
impression
produced
by
his
previous
violence
.
<EOS>
She
was
proof
,
however
,
against
his
arts
;
and
though
he
never
lost
his
mastery
over
himself
,
he
had
some
difficulty
in
concealing
his
chagrin
at
the
result
of
the
interview
.
<EOS>
He
now
began
to
adopt
a
different
course
,
and
entering
into
long
discussions
with
Amabel
,
strove
by
every
effort
of
wit
and
ridicule
,
to
shake
and
subvert
her
moral
and
religious
principles
.
<EOS>
But
here
again
he
failed
;
and
once
more
shifting
his
ground
,
affected
to
be
convinced
by
her
arguments
.
<EOS>
He
entirely
altered
his
demeanour
,
and
though
Amabel
could
not
put
much
faith
in
the
change
,
it
was
a
subject
of
real
rejoicing
to
her
.
<EOS>
Though
scarcely
conscious
of
it
herself
,
he
sensibly
won
upon
her
regards
,
and
she
passed
many
hours
of
each
day
in
his
society
without
finding
it
irksome
.
<EOS>
Seeing
the
advantage
he
had
gained
,
and
well
aware
that
he
should
lose
it
by
the
slightest
indiscretion
,
Rochester
acted
with
the
greatest
caution
.
<EOS>
The
more
at
ease
she
felt
with
him
,
the
more
deferential
did
he
become
;
and
before
she
was
conscious
of
her
danger
,
the
poor
girl
was
once
more
on
the
brink
of
the
precipice
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
about
this
time
that
Leonard
Holt
,
as
has
been
previously
intimated
,
discovered
her
retreat
,
and
contrived
,
by
clambering
up
a
pear
-
tree
which
was
nailed
against
the
wall
of
the
house
,
to
reach
her
chamber
-
window
.
<EOS>
Having
received
her
assurance
that
she
had
resisted
all
Rochester
's
importunities
,
the
apprentice
promised
to
return
on
the
following
night
with
means
to
affect
her
liberation
,
and
departed
.
<EOS>
Fully
persuaded
that
she
could
now
repose
confidence
in
the
earl
,
Amabel
acquainted
him
,
the
next
morning
,
with
Leonard
's
visit
,
adding
that
he
would
now
have
an
opportunity
of
proving
the
sincerity
of
his
professions
by
delivering
her
up
to
her
friends
.
 
<EOS>
"
Since
you
desire
it
,
"
replied
the
earl
,
who
heard
her
with
an
unmoved
countenance
,
though
internally
torn
with
passion
,
"
I
will
convey
you
to
your
father
myself
.
<EOS>
I
had
hoped
,
"
he
added
with
a
sigh
,
"
that
we
should
never
part
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
have
been
mistaken
in
you
,
my
lord
,
"
rejoined
Amabel
,
half
-
repenting
her
frankness
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
anything
you
require
,
except
deliver
you
to
this
hateful
apprentice
.
<EOS>
If
it
is
your
pleasure
,
I
repeat
,
I
will
take
you
back
to
your
father
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Promise
me
this
,
my
lord
,
and
I
shall
be
quite
easy
,
"
cried
Amabel
,
joyfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
promise
it
,
"
he
returned
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
oh
!
<EOS>
why
not
stay
with
me
,
and
complete
the
good
work
you
have
begun
?
"
 
<EOS>
Amabel
averted
her
head
,
and
Rochester
sighing
deeply
,
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
An
attendant
shortly
afterwards
came
to
inform
her
that
the
earl
intended
to
start
for
London
without
delay
,
and
begged
her
to
prepare
for
the
journey
.
<EOS>
In
an
hour
's
time
,
a
carriage
drove
to
the
door
,
and
Rochester
having
placed
her
and
Prudence
in
it
,
mounted
his
horse
,
and
set
forth
.
<EOS>
Late
on
the
second
day
they
arrived
in
London
,
and
passing
through
the
silent
and
deserted
streets
,
the
aspect
of
which
struck
terror
into
all
the
party
,
shaped
their
course
towards
the
city
.
<EOS>
Presently
they
reached
Ludgate
,
but
instead
of
proceeding
to
Wood
-
street
,
the
carriage
turned
off
on
the
right
,
and
traversing
Thames
-
street
,
crossed
London
Bridge
.
<EOS>
Amabel
could
obtain
no
explanation
of
this
change
from
Prudence
;
and
her
uneasiness
was
not
diminished
when
the
vehicle
,
which
was
driven
down
a
narrow
street
on
the
left
immediately
after
quitting
the
bridge
,
stopped
at
the
entrance
of
a
large
court
-
yard
.
<EOS>
Rochester
,
who
had
already
dismounted
,
assisted
her
to
alight
,
and
in
answer
to
her
hasty
inquiries
why
he
had
brought
her
thither
,
told
her
he
thought
it
better
to
defer
taking
her
to
her
father
till
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
Obliged
to
be
content
with
this
excuse
,
she
was
led
into
the
house
,
severely
reproaching
herself
for
her
indiscretion
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
however
,
occurred
to
alarm
her
that
night
.
<EOS>
The
earl
was
even
more
deferential
than
before
,
and
assuring
her
he
would
fulfil
his
promise
in
the
morning
,
confided
her
to
Prudence
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
whither
she
had
been
brought
was
large
and
old
-
fashioned
.
<EOS>
The
rooms
had
once
been
magnificently
fitted
up
,
but
the
hangings
and
furniture
were
much
faded
,
and
had
a
gloomy
and
neglected
air
.
<EOS>
This
was
especially
observable
in
the
sleeping
-
chamber
appointed
for
her
reception
.
<EOS>
It
was
large
and
lofty
,
panelled
with
black
and
shining
oak
,
with
a
highly
-
polished
floor
of
the
same
material
,
and
was
filled
with
cumbrous
chests
and
cabinets
,
and
antique
high
-
backed
chairs
.
<EOS>
But
the
most
noticeable
object
was
a
large
state
-
bed
,
with
a
heavy
square
canopy
,
covered
,
with
the
richest
damask
,
woven
with
gold
,
and
hung
with
curtains
of
the
same
stuff
,
though
now
decayed
and
tarnished
.
<EOS>
A
chill
crept
over
Amabel
as
she
gazed
around
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
help
thinking
,
"
she
observed
to
Prudence
,
"
that
I
shall
breathe
my
last
in
this
room
,
and
in
that
bed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
madam
,
"
returned
the
attendant
,
unable
to
repress
a
shudder
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
more
was
said
,
and
Amabel
retired
to
rest
.
<EOS>
But
not
being
able
to
sleep
,
and
having
vainly
tried
to
compose
herself
,
she
arose
and
opened
the
window
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
serene
and
beautiful
night
,
and
she
could
see
the
smooth
river
sparkling
in
the
starlight
,
and
flowing
at
a
hundred
yards
'
distance
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Beyond
,
she
could
indistinctly
perceive
the
outline
of
the
mighty
city
,
while
nearer
,
on
the
left
,
lay
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
Solemnly
across
the
water
came
the
sound
of
innumerable
bells
,
tolling
for
those
who
had
died
of
the
plague
,
and
were
now
being
borne
to
their
last
home
.
<EOS>
While
listening
to
these
sad
sounds
,
another
,
but
more
doleful
and
appalling
noise
,
caught
her
ears
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
rumbling
of
cart
-
wheels
in
the
adjoining
street
,
accompanied
by
the
ringing
of
a
hand
-
bell
,
while
a
hoarse
-
voice
cried
,
"
Bring
out
your
dead
!
<EOS>
bring
out
your
dead
!
"
<EOS>
On
hearing
this
cry
,
she
closed
the
window
and
retired
.
<EOS>
Morning
broke
before
sleep
visited
her
weary
eyelids
,
and
then
,
overcome
by
fatigue
,
she
dropped
into
a
slumber
,
from
which
she
did
not
awake
until
the
day
was
far
advanced
.
<EOS>
She
found
Prudence
sitting
by
her
bedside
,
and
alarmed
by
the
expression
of
her
countenance
,
anxiously
inquired
what
was
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
madam
,
"
replied
the
attendant
,
"
the
earl
has
been
taken
suddenly
ill
.
<EOS>
He
set
out
for
Wood
-
street
the
first
thing
this
morning
,
and
has
seen
your
father
,
who
refuses
to
receive
you
.
<EOS>
On
his
return
,
he
complained
of
a
slight
sickness
,
which
has
gradually
increased
in
violence
,
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
it
is
the
plague
.
<EOS>
Advice
has
been
sent
for
.
<EOS>
He
prays
you
not
to
disturb
yourself
on
his
account
,
but
to
consider
yourself
sole
mistress
of
this
house
,
whatever
may
befall
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
Amabel
passed
a
miserably
anxious
day
.
<EOS>
A
fresh
interest
had
been
awakened
in
her
heart
in
behalf
of
the
earl
,
and
the
precarious
state
in
which
she
conceived
him
placed
did
not
tend
to
diminish
it
.
<EOS>
She
made
many
inquiries
after
him
,
and
learned
that
he
was
worse
,
while
the
fearful
nature
of
the
attack
could
not
be
questioned
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
Prudence
reported
that
the
distemper
had
made
such
rapid
and
terrible
progress
,
that
his
recovery
was
considered
almost
hopeless
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
raves
continually
of
you
,
madam
,
"
said
the
attendant
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
he
will
expire
with
your
name
on
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Amabel
was
moved
to
tears
by
the
information
,
and
withdrawing
into
a
corner
of
the
room
,
prayed
fervently
for
the
supposed
sufferer
.
<EOS>
Prudence
gazed
at
her
earnestly
and
compassionately
,
and
muttering
something
to
herself
,
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
was
the
critical
one
(
so
it
was
said
)
for
the
earl
,
and
Amabel
awaited
,
in
tearful
anxiety
,
the
moment
that
was
to
decide
his
fate
.
<EOS>
It
came
,
and
he
was
pronounced
out
of
danger
.
<EOS>
When
the
news
was
brought
the
anxious
girl
,
she
fainted
.
 
<EOS>
A
week
passed
,
and
the
earl
,
continued
to
improve
,
and
all
danger
of
infection
--
if
any
such
existed
--
being
at
an
end
,
he
sent
a
message
to
Amabel
,
beseeching
her
to
grant
him
an
interview
in
his
own
room
.
<EOS>
She
willingly
assented
,
and
,
following
the
attendant
,
found
him
stretched
upon
a
couch
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
paleness
and
apparent
debility
,
however
,
his
good
looks
were
but
little
impaired
,
and
his
attire
,
though
negligent
,
was
studiously
arranged
for
effect
.
<EOS>
On
Amabel
's
appearance
he
made
an
effort
to
rise
,
but
she
hastened
to
prevent
him
.
<EOS>
After
thanking
her
for
her
kind
inquiries
,
he
entered
into
a
long
conversation
with
her
,
in
the
course
of
which
he
displayed
sentiments
so
exactly
coinciding
with
her
own
,
that
the
good
opinion
she
had
already
begun
to
entertain
for
him
was
soon
heightened
into
the
liveliest
interest
.
<EOS>
They
parted
,
to
meet
again
on
the
following
day
--
and
on
the
day
following
that
.
<EOS>
The
bloom
returned
to
the
earl
's
countenance
,
and
he
looked
handsomer
than
ever
.
<EOS>
A
week
thus
passed
,
and
at
the
end
of
it
,
he
said--"To
-
morrow
I
shall
be
well
enough
to
venture
forth
again
,
and
my
first
business
shall
be
to
proceed
to
your
father
,
and
see
whether
he
is
now
able
to
receive
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
plague
has
not
yet
abated
,
my
lord
,
"
she
observed
,
blushingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
he
replied
,
looking
passionately
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
forgive
me
,
Amabel
,
"
he
added
,
taking
her
hand
,
which
she
did
not
attempt
to
withdraw
.
"
<EOS>
Forgive
me
,
if
I
am
wrong
.
<EOS>
But
I
now
think
your
feelings
are
altered
towards
me
,
and
that
I
may
venture
to
hope
you
will
be
mine
?
"
 
<EOS>
Amabel
's
bosom
heaved
with
emotion
.
<EOS>
She
tried
to
speak
,
but
could
not
.
<EOS>
Her
head
declined
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
her
tears
flowed
fast
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
answered
,
"
he
cried
,
scarcely
able
to
contain
his
rapture
,
and
straining
her
to
his
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
whether
I
am
doing
rightly
,
"
she
murmured
,
gazing
at
him
through
her
tears
,
"
but
I
believe
you
mean
me
truly
.
<EOS>
God
forgive
you
if
you
do
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
no
more
doubts
,
"
cried
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
wrought
an
entire
change
in
me
.
<EOS>
Our
union
shall
not
be
delayed
an
hour
.
<EOS>
It
shall
take
place
in
Saint
Saviour
's
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
to
-
night
,
"
cried
Amabel
,
trembling
at
his
eagerness--"to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
-
night
,
to
-
night
!
"
reiterated
the
earl
,
victoriously
.
<EOS>
And
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Amabel
was
no
sooner
left
to
herself
than
she
repented
what
she
had
done
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
fear
I
have
made
a
false
step
,
"
she
mused
;
"
but
it
is
now
too
late
to
retreat
,
and
I
will
hope
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
mean
to
deceive
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Her
meditations
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
Prudence
,
who
came
towards
her
with
a
face
full
of
glee
.
<EOS>
"
My
lord
has
informed
me
of
the
good
news
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
to
be
wedded
to
him
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
have
expected
it
all
along
,
but
it
is
somewhat
sudden
at
last
.
<EOS>
He
is
gone
in
search
of
the
priest
,
and
in
the
mean
time
has
ordered
me
to
attire
you
for
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
I
have
several
rich
dresses
for
your
ladyship
--
for
so
I
must
now
call
you
--
to
choose
from
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
simplest
will
suit
me
best
,
"
replied
Amabel
,
"
and
do
not
call
me
ladyship
till
I
have
a
right
to
that
title
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
will
be
so
soon
that
I
am
sure
there
can
be
no
harm
in
using
it
now
,
"
returned
Prudence
.
<EOS>
"
But
pray
let
me
show
you
the
dresses
.
"
 
<EOS>
Amabel
suffered
herself
to
be
led
into
another
room
,
where
she
saw
several
sumptuous
female
habiliments
,
and
selecting
the
least
showy
of
them
,
was
soon
arrayed
in
it
by
the
officious
attendant
.
<EOS>
More
than
two
hours
elapsed
before
Rochester
returned
,
when
he
entered
Amabel
's
chamber
,
accompanied
by
Sir
George
Etherege
and
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
A
feeling
of
misgiving
crossed
Amabel
,
as
she
beheld
his
companions
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
a
clergyman
,
"
said
the
earl
,
"
for
the
rector
of
Saint
Saviour
's
has
fled
from
the
plague
.
<EOS>
His
curate
,
however
,
will
officiate
for
him
,
and
is
now
in
the
church
.
"
 
<EOS>
Amabel
fixed
a
searching
look
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"
Why
are
these
gentlemen
here
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
brought
them
with
me
,
"
rejoined
Rochester
,
"
because
,
as
they
were
aware
of
the
injury
I
once
intended
you
,
I
wish
them
to
be
present
at
its
reparation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
satisfied
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
Taking
her
hand
,
the
earl
then
led
her
to
a
carriage
,
which
conveyed
them
to
Saint
Saviour
's
.
<EOS>
Just
as
they
alighted
,
the
dead
-
cart
passed
,
and
several
bodies
were
brought
towards
it
.
<EOS>
Eager
to
withdraw
her
attention
from
the
spectacle
,
Rochester
hurried
her
into
the
old
and
beautiful
church
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
they
were
joined
by
Etherege
and
Pillichody
,
and
they
proceeded
to
the
altar
,
where
the
priest
,
a
young
man
,
was
standing
.
<EOS>
The
ceremony
was
then
performed
,
and
the
earl
led
his
bride
back
to
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
On
their
return
they
had
to
undergo
another
ill
-
omened
interruption
.
<EOS>
The
dead
-
cart
was
stationed
near
the
gateway
,
and
some
delay
occurred
before
it
could
be
moved
forward
.
 
<EOS>
Amabel
,
however
,
suffered
no
further
misgiving
to
take
possession
of
her
.
<EOS>
Deeming
herself
wedded
to
the
earl
,
she
put
no
constraint
on
her
affection
for
him
,
and
her
happiness
,
though
short
-
lived
,
was
deep
and
full
.
<EOS>
A
month
passed
away
like
a
dream
of
delight
.
<EOS>
Nothing
occurred
in
the
slightest
degree
to
mar
her
felicity
.
<EOS>
Rochester
seemed
only
to
live
for
her
--
to
think
only
of
her
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
this
time
,
some
indifference
began
to
manifest
itself
in
his
deportment
to
her
,
and
he
evinced
a
disposition
to
return
to
the
court
and
to
its
pleasures
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
had
for
ever
abandoned
them
,
my
dear
lord
,
"
said
Amabel
,
reproachfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
awhile
I
have
,
"
he
replied
,
carelessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
leave
me
,
if
you
return
to
them
,
"
she
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
must
,
I
must
,
"
said
the
earl
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
mean
this
,
my
lord
,
"
she
cried
,
bursting
into
tears
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
be
so
changed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
changed
since
you
first
knew
me
,
"
replied
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
"
Impossible
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
in
a
tone
of
anguish
;
"
you
have
not
the
faults
--
the
vices
,
you
once
had
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
what
you
call
faults
and
vices
,
madam
,
"
replied
the
earl
sharply
,
"
but
I
have
the
same
qualities
as
heretofore
.
 
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
understand
,
then
,
"
cried
Amabel
,
a
fearful
suspicion
of
the
truth
breaking
upon
her
,
"
that
you
never
sincerely
repented
your
former
actions
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
to
understand
it
,
"
replied
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
deceived
me
when
you
affirmed
the
contrary
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
deceived
you
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
suspect
,
"
she
cried
,
with
a
look
of
horror
and
doubt
,
"
that
the
attack
of
the
plague
was
feigned
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
far
wide
of
the
truth
,
"
was
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
our
marriage
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cried--"our
marriage
?
<EOS>
Was
that
feigned
likewise
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
,
"
replied
Rochester
,
calmly
.
 
<EOS>
Amabel
looked
at
him
fixedly
for
a
few
minutes
,
as
if
she
could
not
credit
his
assertion
,
and
then
receiving
no
contradiction
,
uttered
a
wild
scream
,
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Rochester
followed
,
and
saw
her
dart
with
lightning
swiftness
across
the
court
-
yard
.
<EOS>
On
gaining
the
street
,
he
perceived
her
flying
figure
already
at
some
distance
;
and
greatly
alarmed
,
started
in
pursuit
.
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
girl
was
not
allowed
to
proceed
far
.
<EOS>
Two
persons
who
were
approaching
,
and
who
proved
to
be
Etherege
and
Pillichody
,
caught
hold
of
her
,
and
detained
her
till
Rochester
came
up
.
<EOS>
When
the
latter
attempted
to
touch
her
,
she
uttered
such
fearful
shrieks
,
that
Etherege
entreated
him
to
desist
.
<EOS>
With
some
difficulty
she
was
taken
back
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
evident
that
the
shock
had
unsettled
her
reason
.
<EOS>
She
alternately
uttered
wild
,
piercing
screams
,
or
broke
into
hysterical
laughter
.
<EOS>
The
earl
's
presence
so
much
increased
her
frenzy
,
that
he
gladly
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
melancholy
business
,
my
lord
,
"
observed
Etherege
,
as
they
quitted
the
room
together
,
"
and
I
am
sorry
for
my
share
in
it
.
<EOS>
We
have
both
much
to
answer
for
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
her
life
in
danger
?
"
rejoined
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
well
if
it
were
so
,
"
returned
the
other
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
fear
she
will
live
to
be
a
perpetual
memento
to
you
of
the
crime
you
have
committed
.
"
 
<EOS>
Amabel
's
delirium
produced
a
high
fever
,
which
continued
for
three
days
.
<EOS>
Her
screams
were
at
times
so
dreadful
,
that
her
betrayer
shut
himself
up
in
the
furthest
part
of
the
house
,
that
he
might
not
hear
them
.
<EOS>
When
at
last
she
sank
into
a
sleep
like
that
of
death
,
produced
by
powerful
opiates
,
he
stole
into
the
room
,
and
gazed
at
her
with
feelings
which
those
who
watched
his
countenance
did
not
envy
.
<EOS>
It
was
hoped
by
the
chirurgeon
in
attendance
,
that
when
the
violence
of
the
fever
abated
,
Amabel
's
reason
would
be
restored
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
so
.
<EOS>
Her
faculties
were
completely
shaken
,
and
the
cause
of
her
affliction
being
effaced
from
her
memory
,
she
now
spoke
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
with
her
former
affection
.
 
<EOS>
Her
betrayer
once
ventured
into
her
presence
,
but
he
did
not
repeat
the
visit
.
<EOS>
Her
looks
and
her
tenderness
were
more
than
even
_
<EOS>
his
_
firmness
could
bear
,
and
he
hurried
away
to
hide
his
emotion
from
the
attendants
.
<EOS>
Several
days
passed
on
,
and
as
no
improvement
took
place
,
the
earl
,
who
began
to
find
the
stings
of
conscience
too
sharp
for
further
endurance
,
resolved
to
try
to
deaden
the
pangs
by
again
plunging
into
the
dissipation
of
the
court
.
<EOS>
Prudence
had
been
seized
by
the
plague
,
and
removed
to
the
pest
-
house
,
and
not
knowing
to
whom
to
entrust
Amabel
,
it
at
last
occurred
to
him
that
Judith
Malmayns
would
be
a
fitting
person
,
and
he
accordingly
sent
for
her
from
Saint
Paul
's
,
and
communicated
his
wishes
to
her
,
offering
her
a
considerable
reward
for
the
service
.
<EOS>
Judith
readily
undertook
the
office
,
and
the
earl
delayed
his
departure
for
two
days
,
to
see
how
all
went
on
;
and
finding
the
arrangements
,
to
all
appearances
,
answer
perfectly
,
he
departed
with
Etherege
and
Pillichody
.
 
<EOS>
Ever
since
the
communication
of
the
fatal
truth
had
been
made
to
her
by
the
earl
,
his
unfortunate
victim
had
occupied
the
large
oak
-
panelled
chamber
,
on
entering
which
so
sad
a
presentiment
had
seized
her
;
and
she
had
never
quitted
the
bed
where
she
thought
she
would
breathe
her
last
.
<EOS>
On
the
night
of
Rochester
's
departure
she
made
many
inquiries
concerning
him
from
Judith
Malmayns
,
who
was
seated
in
an
old
broad
-
cushioned
,
velvet
-
covered
chair
,
beside
her
,
and
was
told
that
the
king
required
his
attendance
at
Oxford
,
but
that
he
would
soon
return
.
<EOS>
At
this
answer
the
tears
gathered
thickly
in
Amabel
's
dark
eyelashes
,
and
she
remained
silent
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
she
resumed
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
nurse
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
look
of
extreme
anxiety
,
"
I
have
forgotten
my
prayers
.
<EOS>
Repeat
them
to
me
,
and
I
will
say
them
after
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
memory
is
as
bad
as
your
ladyship
's
,
"
replied
Judith
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
long
since
I
said
mine
,
that
I
have
quite
forgotten
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
wrong
in
you
,
"
returned
Amabel
,
"
very
wrong
.
<EOS>
When
I
lived
with
my
dear
father
,
we
had
prayers
morning
and
evening
,
and
I
was
never
so
happy
as
then
.
<EOS>
I
feel
it
would
do
me
good
if
I
could
pray
as
I
used
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
all
in
good
time
,
"
replied
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
you
are
better
,
you
shall
go
back
to
your
father
,
and
then
you
can
do
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
I
can
not
go
back
to
him
,
"
returned
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
Earl
of
Rochester
's
wife
--
his
wedded
wife
.
<EOS>
Am
I
not
Countess
of
Rochester
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
you
are
,
"
replied
Judith--"to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
sometimes
think
otherwise
,
"
rejoined
Amabel
,
mournfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
so
my
dear
lord
is
gone
to
Oxford
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
,
"
returned
Judith
,
"
but
he
will
be
back
soon
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
"
she
added
,
with
some
impatience
,
"
you
have
talked
quite
long
enough
.
<EOS>
You
must
take
your
composing
draught
,
and
go
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
she
arose
,
and
stepping
to
the
table
which
stood
by
the
side
of
the
bed
,
filled
a
wine
-
glass
with
the
contents
of
a
silver
flagon
,
and
gave
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
Amabel
drank
the
mixture
,
and
complaining
of
its
nauseous
taste
,
Judith
handed
her
a
plate
of
fruit
from
the
table
to
remove
it
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
she
dropped
asleep
,
when
the
nurse
arose
,
and
taking
a
light
from
the
table
,
cautiously
possessed
herself
of
a
bunch
of
keys
which
were
placed
in
a
small
pocket
over
Amabel
's
head
,
and
proceeded
to
unlock
a
large
chest
that
stood
near
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
She
found
it
filled
with
valuables
--
with
chains
of
gold
,
necklaces
of
precious
stones
,
loops
of
pearl
,
diamond
crosses
,
and
other
ornaments
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
there
were
shawls
and
stuffs
of
the
richest
description
.
<EOS>
While
contemplating
these
treasures
,
and
considering
how
she
should
carry
them
off
without
alarming
the
household
,
she
was
startled
by
a
profound
sigh
;
and
looking
towards
the
bed
,
perceived
to
her
great
alarm
,
that
Amabel
had
opened
her
eyes
,
and
was
watching
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
doing
there
,
nurse
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
looking
at
these
pretty
things
,
your
ladyship
,
"
replied
Judith
,
in
an
embarrassed
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
are
not
going
to
steal
them
?
"
said
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Steal
them
?
"
<EOS>
echoed
Judith
,
alarmed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
What
should
make
your
ladyship
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Amabel
;
"
but
put
them
by
,
and
bring
the
keys
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Judith
feigned
compliance
,
but
long
before
she
had
restored
the
things
to
the
chest
,
Amabel
had
again
fallen
asleep
.
<EOS>
Apprised
by
her
tranquil
breathing
of
this
circumstance
,
Judith
arose
;
and
shading
the
candle
with
her
hand
,
crept
noiselessly
towards
the
bed
.
<EOS>
Dark
thoughts
crossed
her
as
she
gazed
at
the
unfortunate
sleeper
;
and
moving
with
the
utmost
caution
,
she
set
the
light
on
the
table
behind
the
curtains
,
and
had
just
grasped
the
pillow
,
with
the
intention
of
plucking
it
from
under
Amabel
's
head
,
and
of
smothering
her
with
it
,
when
she
felt
herself
restrained
by
a
powerful
grasp
,
and
turning
in
utmost
alarm
,
beheld
the
Earl
of
Rochester
.
  
<EOS>
VI
.
 
<EOS>
THE
CERTIFICATE
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wretch
!
"
cried
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
An
instinctive
dread
that
you
would
do
your
poor
charge
some
injury
brought
me
back
,
and
I
thank
Heaven
I
have
arrived
in
time
to
prevent
your
atrocious
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
lordship
would
have
acted
more
discreetly
in
staying
away
,
"
replied
Judith
,
recovering
her
resolution
;
"
and
I
would
recommend
you
not
to
meddle
in
the
matter
,
but
to
leave
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
No
suspicion
shall
alight
on
you
,
nor
shall
it
even
be
known
that
her
end
was
hastened
.
<EOS>
Leave
the
house
as
secretly
as
you
came
,
and
proceed
on
your
journey
with
a
light
heart
.
<EOS>
She
will
never
trouble
you
further
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
exclaimed
Rochester
,
who
was
struck
dumb
for
the
moment
by
surprise
and
indignation
,
"
do
you
imagine
I
would
listen
to
such
a
proposal
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
would
sanction
her
murder
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
would
,
if
you
knew
as
much
as
I
do
,
"
replied
Judith
,
calmly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hear
me
,
my
lord
,
"
she
continued
,
drawing
him
to
a
little
distance
from
the
bed
,
and
speaking
in
a
deep
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
marry
Mistress
Mallet
while
this
girl
lives
.
"
 
<EOS>
Rochester
looked
sternly
and
inquiringly
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
think
your
marriage
was
feigned
,
"
pursued
Judith
;
"
<EOS>
that
he
was
no
priest
who
performed
the
ceremony
;
and
that
no
other
witnesses
were
present
except
Sir
George
Etherege
and
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
and
Chowles
were
present
;
and
he
who
officiated
_
was
_
a
priest
.
<EOS>
The
marriage
was
a
lawful
one
;
and
yon
sleeping
girl
,
who
,
but
for
your
ill
-
timed
interference
,
would
,
ere
this
,
have
breathed
her
last
,
is
to
all
intents
and
purposes
Countess
of
Rochester
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
lie
!
"
cried
the
earl
,
furiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
soon
prove
it
to
be
truth
,
"
rejoined
Judith
.
"
<EOS>
Your
retainer
and
unscrupulous
agent
,
Major
Pillichody
,
applied
to
Chowles
to
find
some
one
to
personate
a
clergyman
in
a
mock
marriage
,
which
your
lordship
wished
to
have
performed
,
and
promised
a
handsome
reward
for
the
service
.
<EOS>
Chowles
mentioned
the
subject
to
me
,
and
we
speedily
contrived
a
plan
to
outwit
your
lordship
,
and
turn
the
affair
to
our
advantage
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
earl
uttered
an
ejaculation
of
rage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Being
acquainted
with
one
of
the
minor
canons
of
Saint
Paul
's
,
a
worthy
and
pious
young
man
,
named
Vincent
,
"
pursued
Judith
,
utterly
unmoved
by
Rochester
's
anger
,
"
who
resided
hard
by
the
cathedral
,
we
hastened
to
him
,
and
acquainted
him
with
the
design
,
representing
ourselves
as
anxious
to
serve
the
poor
girl
,
and
defeat
your
lordship
's
wicked
design
--
for
such
we
termed
it
.
<EOS>
With
a
little
persuasion
,
Mr.
Vincent
consented
to
the
scheme
.
<EOS>
Pillichody
was
easily
duped
by
Chowles
's
statement
,
and
the
ceremony
was
fully
performed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
whole
story
is
a
fabrication
,
"
cried
the
earl
,
with
affected
incredulity
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
certificate
of
the
marriage
,
"
replied
Judith
,
"
signed
by
Mr.
Vincent
,
and
attested
by
Chowles
and
myself
.
<EOS>
If
ever
woman
was
wedded
to
man
,
Amabel
is
wedded
to
your
lordship
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
this
is
the
case
,
why
seek
to
destroy
her
?
"
demanded
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
life
must
be
of
more
consequence
to
you
than
her
removal
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
deal
frankly
with
you
,
"
replied
Judith
.
"
<EOS>
She
discovered
me
in
the
act
of
emptying
that
chest
,
and
an
irresistible
impulse
prompted
me
to
make
away
with
her
.
<EOS>
But
your
lordship
is
in
the
right
.
<EOS>
Her
life
_
is
_
valuable
to
me
,
and
she
_
shall
_
live
.
<EOS>
But
,
I
repeat
,
you
can
not
marry
the
rich
heiress
,
Mistress
Mallet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Temptress
!
"
cried
the
earl
,
"
you
put
frightful
thoughts
into
my
head
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Go
your
ways
,
"
replied
Judith
,
"
and
think
no
more
about
her
.
<EOS>
All
shall
be
done
that
you
require
.
<EOS>
I
claim
as
my
reward
the
contents
of
that
chest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
reward
shall
be
the
gallows
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
,
indignantly
.
<EOS>
"
I
reject
your
proposal
at
once
.
<EOS>
Begone
,
wretch
!
<EOS>
or
I
shall
forget
you
are
a
woman
,
and
sacrifice
you
to
my
fury
.
<EOS>
Begone
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
your
lordship
pleases
,
"
she
replied
;
"
but
first
,
the
Countess
of
Rochester
shall
be
made
acquainted
with
her
rights
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
broke
from
him
,
and
rushed
to
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
about
to
do
?
"
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Waken
her
,
"
rejoined
Judith
,
slightly
shaking
the
sleeper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
Amabel
,
opening
her
eyes
,
and
gazing
at
her
with
a
terrified
and
bewildered
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
lordship
is
returned
,
"
said
Judith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Amabel
,
raising
herself
in
the
bed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
is
he?--Ah
,
I
see
him.--Come
to
me
,
my
dear
lord
,
"
she
added
,
stretching
out
her
arms
to
him
,
"
Come
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
evil
thoughts
kept
Rochester
motionless
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
come
to
me
,
my
lord
,
"
cried
Amabel
,
in
a
troubled
tone
,
"
or
I
shall
begin
to
think
what
I
have
dreamed
is
true
,
and
that
I
am
not
wedded
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
_
was
_
merely
a
dream
,
your
ladyship
,
"
observed
Judith
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
bear
witness
you
are
wedded
to
his
lordship
,
<EOS>
for
I
was
present
at
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
see
you
,
"
remarked
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
there
,
nevertheless
,
"
replied
Judith
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
hear
it
,
"
replied
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
would
rejoice
if
you
knew
all
,
"
returned
Judith
,
significantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
so
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
other
,
curiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
the
clergyman
who
married
you
is
dead
of
the
plague
,
"
was
the
answer
;
"
and
it
may
chance
in
these
terrible
times
that
the
two
gentlemen
who
were
present
at
the
ceremony
may
die
of
the
same
distemper
,
and
then
there
will
be
no
one
left
but
me
and
another
person
to
prove
that
your
marriage
was
lawful
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
its
lawfulness
will
never
be
questioned
,
my
dear
lord
,
will
it
?
"
asked
Amabel
,
looking
beseechingly
at
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
replied
Judith
,
producing
a
small
piece
of
parchment
,
"
while
I
hold
this
certificate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
that
document
,
"
said
the
earl
,
in
an
undertone
,
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Judith
directed
her
eyes
towards
the
chest
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
yours
,
"
said
the
earl
,
in
the
same
tone
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
whispering
,
my
lord
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Amabel
,
uneasily
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
merely
telling
her
to
remove
that
chest
,
sweetheart
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
send
it
away
,
"
cried
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
It
contains
all
the
ornaments
and
trinkets
you
have
given
me
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
"
she
added
in
a
whisper
,
"
I
caught
her
looking
into
it
just
now
,
and
I
suspect
she
was
about
to
steal
something
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pshaw
!
"
cried
the
earl
,
"
she
acted
by
my
directions
.
<EOS>
Take
the
chest
away
,
"
he
added
to
Judith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Has
your
lordship
no
further
orders
?
<EOS>
"
she
rejoined
,
significantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
None
whatever
,
"
he
replied
,
with
a
frown
.
 
<EOS>
"
Before
you
go
,
give
me
the
certificate
,
"
cried
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Judith
pretended
not
to
hear
her
.
"
<EOS>
Give
it
her
,
"
whispered
the
earl
,
"
I
will
remove
it
when
she
falls
asleep
.
"
 
<EOS>
Nodding
acquiescence
<EOS>
,
Judith
took
the
parchment
from
her
bosom
,
and
returned
with
it
to
the
bed
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
passing
,
the
earl
walked
towards
the
chest
,
and
cast
his
eye
over
such
of
its
contents
as
were
scattered
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Judith
watched
him
carefully
,
and
when
his
back
was
turned
,
drew
a
small
lancet
,
and
affecting
to
arrange
her
dress
,
slightly
punctured
Amabel
's
neck
.
<EOS>
The
pain
was
trifling
,
but
the
poor
girl
uttered
a
cry
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
earl
,
turning
suddenly
round
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
--
nothing
,
"
replied
Judith
;
"
a
pin
in
my
sleeve
pricked
her
as
I
was
fastening
her
cap
,
that
was
all
.
<EOS>
Her
death
is
certain
,
"
she
added
to
herself
,
"
she
is
inoculated
with
the
plague
-
venom
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
then
went
to
the
chest
,
and
replacing
everything
within
it
,
removed
it
,
by
the
help
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
into
the
adjoining
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
send
for
it
at
midnight
,
"
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
delivered
to
your
messenger
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
;
"
but
you
will
answer
for
Chowles
's
secrecy
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
returned
Judith
,
with
a
meaning
smile
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
you
will
not
be
troubled
long
with
your
wife
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
any
judgment
respecting
the
plague
,
she
is
already
infected
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
cried
Rochester--"then--
<EOS>
"
but
he
checked
himself
,
and
added
,
"
I
do
not
believe
it
.
<EOS>
Begone
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
_
<EOS>
does
_
believe
it
for
all
that
,
"
muttered
Judith
,
as
he
slunk
away
.
 
<EOS>
Rochester
returned
to
Amabel
,
and
sat
by
her
until
she
fell
asleep
,
when
he
took
the
parchment
from
beneath
the
pillow
where
she
had
placed
it
.
<EOS>
Examining
it
,
he
found
it
,
as
Judith
had
stated
,
a
certificate
of
his
marriage
,
signed
by
Mark
Vincent
,
the
clergyman
who
had
officiated
,
and
duly
attested
.
<EOS>
Having
carefully
perused
it
,
he
held
it
towards
the
taper
,
with
the
intention
of
destroying
it
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
about
to
perpetrate
this
unworthy
action
,
he
looked
towards
the
bed
.
<EOS>
The
soft
sweet
smile
that
played
upon
the
sleeper
's
features
,
turned
him
from
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
Placing
the
parchment
in
his
doublet
,
he
left
the
room
,
and
summoning
a
female
attendant
,
alleged
some
reason
for
his
unexpected
return
,
and
ordered
her
to
watch
by
the
bedside
of
her
mistress
.
<EOS>
Giving
some
further
directions
,
he
threw
himself
upon
a
couch
and
sought
a
few
hours
'
repose
.
<EOS>
At
daybreak
,
he
repaired
to
Amabel
's
chamber
,
and
finding
her
wrapped
in
a
peaceful
slumber
,
he
commended
her
to
the
attendant
,
and
departed
.
 
<EOS>
On
awaking
,
Amabel
complained
of
an
uneasy
sensation
on
her
neck
,
and
the
attendant
examining
the
spot
,
found
,
to
her
great
alarm
,
a
small
red
pustule
.
<EOS>
Without
making
a
single
observation
,
she
left
the
room
,
and
despatched
a
messenger
after
the
Earl
of
Rochester
to
acquaint
him
that
the
countess
was
attacked
by
the
plague
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
terror
inspired
by
this
dread
disorder
,
that
the
moment
it
was
known
that
Amabel
was
attacked
by
it
,
the
whole
household
,
except
an
old
woman
,
fled
.
<EOS>
This
old
woman
,
whose
name
was
Batley
,
and
who
acted
as
the
earl
's
housekeeper
,
took
upon
herself
the
office
of
nurse
.
<EOS>
Before
evening
,
the
poor
sufferer
,
who
had
endured
great
agony
during
the
whole
of
the
day
,
became
so
much
worse
,
that
Mrs.
Batley
ran
out
in
search
of
assistance
.
<EOS>
She
met
with
a
watchman
,
who
told
her
that
a
famous
apothecary
,
from
Clerkenwell
,
named
Sibbald
,
who
was
celebrated
for
the
cures
he
had
effected
,
had
just
entered
a
neighbouring
house
,
and
offered
to
await
his
coming
forth
,
and
send
him
to
her
.
<EOS>
Thanking
him
,
Mrs.
Batley
returned
to
the
house
,
and
presently
afterwards
,
Sibbald
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
His
looks
and
person
had
become
even
more
repulsive
than
formerly
.
<EOS>
He
desired
to
be
led
to
the
patient
,
and
on
seeing
her
,
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
examined
the
pustule
,
which
had
greatly
increased
in
size
,
and
turning
away
,
muttered
,
"
I
can
do
nothing
for
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
least
make
the
attempt
,
"
implored
Mrs.
Batley
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
the
Countess
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
You
shall
be
well
rewarded
--
and
if
you
cure
her
,
the
earl
will
make
your
fortune
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
his
lordship
would
change
stations
with
me
,
I
could
not
cure
her
,
"
replied
Sibbald
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
look
at
her
again
,
"
he
added
,
examining
the
pustule
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
strange
appearance
about
this
tumour
.
<EOS>
Has
Judith
Malmayns
attended
her
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
was
here
yesterday
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Batley
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
so
,
"
he
muttered
.
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
it
is
all
over
with
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
turned
to
depart
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
leave
her
thus
,
in
pity
do
not
!
"
cried
the
old
woman
,
detaining
him
.
"
<EOS>
Make
some
effort
to
save
her
.
<EOS>
My
lord
loves
her
to
distraction
,
and
will
abundantly
reward
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
All
I
can
do
is
to
give
her
something
to
allay
the
pain
,
"
returned
Sibbald
.
<EOS>
And
drawing
a
small
phial
from
his
doublet
,
he
poured
its
contents
into
a
glass
,
and
administered
it
to
the
patient
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
will
throw
her
into
a
slumber
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
when
she
wakes
,
she
will
be
without
pain
.
<EOS>
But
her
end
will
be
not
far
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Batley
took
a
purse
from
a
drawer
in
one
of
the
cabinets
,
and
gave
it
to
the
apothecary
,
who
bowed
and
retired
.
<EOS>
As
he
had
foretold
,
Amabel
fell
into
a
heavy
lethargy
,
which
continued
during
the
whole
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Batley
,
who
had
never
left
her
,
noticed
that
an
extraordinary
and
fearful
change
had
taken
place
in
her
countenance
,
and
she
could
not
doubt
that
the
apothecary
's
prediction
would
be
realized
.
<EOS>
The
tumour
had
increased
in
size
,
and
was
surrounded
by
a
dusky
brown
circle
,
which
she
knew
to
be
a
bad
sign
.
<EOS>
The
sufferer
's
eyes
,
when
she
opened
them
,
and
gazed
around
,
had
a
dim
and
glazed
look
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
perfectly
calm
and
composed
,
and
,
as
had
been
prognosticated
,
free
from
pain
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
also
,
fully
regained
her
faculties
,
and
seemed
quite
aware
of
her
dangerous
situation
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
return
of
reason
brought
with
it
no
solace
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
the
earl
's
treachery
rushed
upon
her
recollection
,
and
gave
her
infinitely
more
anguish
than
the
bodily
pain
she
had
recently
endured
.
<EOS>
She
bedewed
the
pillow
with
her
tears
,
and
fervently
prayed
for
forgiveness
for
her
involuntary
fault
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Batley
was
deeply
moved
by
her
affliction
,
and
offered
her
every
consolation
in
her
power
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
the
plague
had
selected
me
for
a
victim
instead
of
your
ladyship
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
hard
to
leave
the
world
at
your
age
,
possessed
of
beauty
,
honours
,
and
wealth
.
<EOS>
At
mine
,
it
would
not
signify
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
mistake
the
cause
of
my
grief
,
"
returned
Amabel
;
"
I
do
not
lament
that
my
hour
is
at
hand
,
but--
"
and
her
emotion
so
overpowered
her
that
she
could
not
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
disturb
yourself
further
,
dear
lady
,
"
rejoined
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
Let
the
worst
happen
,
I
am
sure
you
are
well
prepared
to
meet
your
Maker
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
once
was
,
"
replied
Amabel
in
a
voice
of
despair
,
"
but
now
--
<EOS>
Oh
,
Heaven
forgive
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
fetch
some
holy
minister
to
pray
beside
you
,
my
lady
?
"
said
Mrs.
Batley
;
"
one
to
whom
you
can
pour
forth
the
sorrows
of
your
heart
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
so
!
<EOS>
oh
,
do
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Amabel
,
"
and
do
not
call
me
lady
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
worthy
to
be
placed
in
the
same
rank
as
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Her
wits
are
clean
gone
,
"
muttered
Mrs.
Batley
,
looking
at
her
compassionately
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heed
me
not
,
"
cried
Amabel
;
"
but
if
you
have
any
pity
for
the
unfortunate
,
do
as
you
have
promised
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
--
I
will
,
"
said
Mrs.
Batley
,
departing
.
 
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
,
which
scarcely
seemed
a
moment
to
the
poor
sufferer
,
who
was
employed
in
fervent
prayer
,
elapsed
before
Mrs.
Batley
returned
.
<EOS>
She
was
accompanied
by
a
tall
man
,
whom
Amabel
recognised
as
Solomon
Eagle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
been
able
to
find
a
clergyman
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
"
but
I
have
brought
a
devout
man
who
is
willing
to
pray
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
the
enthusiast
,
starting
as
he
beheld
Amabel
.
"
<EOS>
Can
it
be
Mr.
Bloundel
's
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
returned
Amabel
with
a
groan
.
"
<EOS>
Leave
us
,
my
good
woman
,
"
she
added
to
Mrs.
Batley
,
"
I
have
something
to
impart
to
Solomon
Eagle
which
is
for
his
ear
alone
.
"
<EOS>
The
old
woman
instantly
retired
,
and
Amabel
briefly
related
her
hapless
story
to
the
enthusiast
.
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
hope
for
forgiveness
?
"
<EOS>
she
inquired
,
as
she
concluded
.
 
<EOS>
"
Assuredly
,
"
replied
Solomon
Eagle
,
"
assuredly
!
<EOS>
You
have
not
erred
wilfully
,
but
through
ignorance
,
and
therefore
have
committed
no
offence
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
will
be
forgiven
--
but
woe
to
your
deceiver
,
here
and
hereafter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
'
say
not
so
,
"
she
cried
.
"
<EOS>
May
Heaven
pardon
him
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
While
I
have
strength
left
I
will
pray
for
him
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
poured
forth
her
supplications
for
the
earl
in
terms
so
earnest
and
pathetic
,
that
the
tears
flowed
down
Solomon
Eagle
's
rough
cheek
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
hasty
steps
were
heard
in
the
adjoining
passage
,
and
the
door
opening
,
admitted
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
who
rushed
towards
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Back
!
"
cried
Solomon
Eagle
,
pushing
him
forcibly
aside
.
"
<EOS>
Back
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
here
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Rochester
,
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
watching
over
the
death
-
bed
of
your
victim
,
"
returned
Solomon
Eagle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Retire
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
You
disturb
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
"
returned
Amabel
,
meekly
.
<EOS>
"
Let
him
come
near
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
Solomon
Eagle
drew
a
little
aside
,
and
allowed
the
earl
to
approach
,
she
added
,
"
With
my
latest
breath
I
forgive
you
,
my
lord
,
for
the
wrong
you
have
done
me
,
and
bless
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
earl
tried
to
speak
,
but
his
voice
was
suffocated
by
emotion
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
could
find
words
,
he
said
,
"
Your
goodness
completely
overpowers
me
,
dearest
Amabel
.
<EOS>
Heaven
is
my
witness
,
that
even
now
I
would
make
you
all
the
reparation
in
my
power
were
it
needful
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
so
.
<EOS>
The
wrong
I
intended
you
was
never
committed
.
<EOS>
I
myself
was
deceived
.
<EOS>
I
intended
a
feigned
marriage
,
but
it
was
rightfully
performed
.
<EOS>
Time
will
not
allow
me
to
enter
into
further
particulars
of
the
unhappy
transaction
,
but
you
may
credit
my
assertion
when
I
tell
you
you
are
indeed
my
wife
,
and
Countess
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
thought
so
,
I
should
die
happy
,
"
replied
Amabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Behold
this
proof
!
"
said
Rochester
,
producing
the
certificate
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
read
it
,
"
replied
Amabel
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
could
not
have
the
heart
to
deceive
me
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
read
it
,
and
you
well
know
_
<EOS>
I
_
would
not
deceive
you
,
"
cried
Solomon
Eagle
,
casting
his
eye
over
<EOS>
it--"His
<EOS>
lordship
has
avouched
the
truth
,
"
he
continued
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
certificate
of
your
marriage
with
him
,
duly
signed
and
attested
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
God
be
thanked
,
"
ejaculated
Amabel
,
fervently
.
<EOS>
"
God
be
thanked
!
<EOS>
You
have
been
spared
that
guilt
,
and
I
shall
die
content
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
your
life
will
long
be
spared
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
.
<EOS>
Amabel
shook
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
but
one
man
in
this
city
who
could
save
her
,
"
whispered
Solomon
Eagle
,
and
I
doubt
even
his
power
to
do
so
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
Who
do
you
mean
?
"
cried
Rochester
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Hodges
,
"
replied
the
enthusiast
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
him
well
,
"
cried
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
fly
to
him
instantly
.
<EOS>
Remain
with
her
till
I
return
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
lord
--
my
dear
lord
,
"
interposed
Amabel
,
faintly
,
"
you
trouble
yourself
needlessly
.
<EOS>
I
am
past
all
human
aid
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
despair
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Many
years
of
happiness
are
,
I
trust
,
in
store
for
us
.
<EOS>
Do
not
detain
me
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
save
you
.
<EOS>
Farewell
for
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
for
ever
,
my
lord
,
"
she
said
,
gently
pressing
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
meet
again
.
<EOS>
Your
name
will
be
coupled
with
my
latest
breath
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
completely
unmanned
if
I
stay
here
a
moment
longer
,
"
cried
the
earl
,
breaking
from
her
,
and
rushing
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
gone
,
Amabel
addressed
herself
once
more
to
prayer
with
Solomon
Eagle
,
and
in
this
way
an
hour
passed
by
.
<EOS>
The
earl
not
returning
at
the
end
of
that
time
,
Solomon
Eagle
became
extremely
uneasy
,
every
moment
being
of
the
utmost
consequence
,
and
summoning
Mrs.
Batley
,
committed
the
patient
to
her
care
,
and
set
off
in
search
of
Hodges
.
<EOS>
He
hastened
to
the
doctor
's
house
--
<EOS>
he
was
absent
--
to
Saint
Paul's
--
he
was
not
there
,
but
he
learnt
that
a
person
answering
to
the
earl
's
description
had
been
making
similar
inquiries
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
one
of
the
chirurgeon
's
assistants
told
him
that
he
thought
the
doctor
was
gone
towards
Cornhill
,
and
hoping
,
accidentally
,
to
meet
with
him
,
the
enthusiast
set
off
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
While
passing
near
the
Exchange
,
he
encountered
Leonard
,
as
before
related
,
but
did
not
think
fit
to
acquaint
him
with
more
than
Amabel
's
dangerous
situation
;
and
he
had
reason
to
regret
making
the
communication
at
all
,
on
finding
its
effect
upon
the
poor
youth
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
however
,
no
help
for
it
,
and
placing
him
in
what
appeared
a
situation
of
safety
,
he
left
him
.
 
<EOS>
Rochester
,
meanwhile
,
had
been
equally
unsuccessful
in
his
search
for
Hodges
.
<EOS>
Hurrying
first
in
one
direction
and
then
in
another
,
at
the
suggestion
of
the
chirurgeon
's
assistant
,
he
at
last
repaired
to
the
doctor
's
residence
,
determined
to
await
his
return
.
<EOS>
In
half
an
hour
he
came
,
and
received
the
earl
,
as
the
old
porter
stated
to
Thirlby
and
Leonard
,
with
angry
astonishment
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
were
alone
,
the
earl
told
him
all
that
had
occurred
,
and
besought
him
to
accompany
him
to
the
poor
sufferer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
her
,
"
said
Hodges
,
who
had
listened
to
the
recital
with
mixed
feelings
of
sorrow
and
indignation
,
"
on
one
condition
--
and
one
only
--
namely
,
that
your
lordship
does
not
see
her
again
without
my
permission
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
impose
this
restriction
upon
,
me
sir
?
'
<EOS>
demanded
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
give
my
reasons
,
my
lord
,
"
returned
Hodges
;
"
but
I
will
only
go
upon
such
terms
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
must
perforce
submit
,
"
replied
the
earl
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
entreat
you
to
set
forth
-
without
a
moment
's
delay
,
or
you
will
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
follow
you
instantly
,
"
rejoined
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
Your
lordship
can
wait
for
me
at
the
Southwark
side
of
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
then
opened
the
door
,
reiterating
the
terms
upon
which
alone
he
would
attend
,
and
the
earl
departed
.
 
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
he
set
out
,
and
making
the
best
of
his
way
,
found
Rochester
at
the
appointed
place
.
<EOS>
The
latter
conducted
him
to
the
entrance
of
the
habitation
,
and
indicating
a
spot
where
he
would
remain
till
his
return
,
left
him
.
<EOS>
Hodges
soon
found
his
way
to
the
chamber
of
the
sufferer
,
and
at
once
perceived
that
all
human
aid
was
vain
.
<EOS>
She
exhibited
much
pleasure
at
seeing
him
,
and
looked
round
,
as
if
in
search
of
the
earl
.
<EOS>
Guessing
her
meaning
,
the
physician
,
who
now
began
to
regret
the
interdiction
he
had
placed
upon
him
,
told
her
that
he
was
the
cause
of
his
absence
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
well
,
"
she
murmured--"well
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
made
some
inquiries
after
her
relatives
,
and
receiving
a
satisfactory
answer
,
said
,
"
I
am
glad
you
are
come
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
able
to
tell
my
father
how
I
died
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
a
great
comfort
to
him
to
learn
the
tranquil
frame
in
which
I
have
found
you
,
"
replied
Hodges
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
long
have
I
to
live
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Amabel
,
somewhat
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
deceive
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
make
your
preparations
without
delay
,
"
returned
Hodges
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
"
she
replied
;
and
joining
her
hands
upon
her
breast
,
she
began
to
murmur
a
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
Hodges
,
who
up
to
this
moment
had
had
some
difficulty
in
repressing
his
emotion
,
withdrew
to
a
short
distance
to
hide
his
fast
-
falling
tears
.
<EOS>
He
was
roused
shortly
after
,
by
a
sudden
and
startling
cry
from
the
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir
,
she
is
going
!
<EOS>
she
is
going
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mrs.
Batley
.
<EOS>
He
found
the
exclamation
true
.
<EOS>
The
eyes
of
the
dying
girl
were
closed
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
slight
quiver
of
the
lips
,
as
if
she
murmured
some
name
--
probably
Rochester's
--
and
then
all
was
over
.
 
<EOS>
Hodges
gazed
at
her
sorrowfully
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
He
then
roused
himself
,
and
giving
some
necessary
directions
to
the
old
woman
respecting
the
body
,
quitted
the
house
.
<EOS>
Not
finding
the
earl
at
the
place
he
had
appointed
to
meet
him
,
after
waiting
for
a
short
time
,
he
proceeded
,
towards
his
own
house
.
<EOS>
On
the
way
he
was
net
by
Thirlby
and
Parravicin
,
as
previously
related
,
and
conducted
to
the
house
in
Nicholas
-
lane
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
necessary
to
recapitulate
what
subsequently
occurred
.
<EOS>
We
shall
,
therefore
,
proceed
to
the
point
of
time
when
he
quitted
his
new
patient
,
and
entered
the
room
where
Thirlby
and
Leonard
were
waiting
for
him
.
<EOS>
Both
,
as
has
been
stated
,
rushed
towards
him
,
and
the
former
eagerly
asked
his
opinion
respecting
his
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
opinion
is
positive
,
"
replied
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
care
,
she
will
undoubtedly
recover
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
be
thanked
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Thirlby
,
dropping
on
his
knees
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
one
word
to
me
,
sir
,
"
cried
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
What
of
Amabel
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
"
exclaimed
the
doctor
,
"
her
troubles
are
ended
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dead
!
"
shrieked
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
dead
!
"
repeated
the
doctor
.
"
<EOS>
She
died
of
the
plague
to
-
night
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
proceeded
to
detail
briefly
all
that
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
Leonard
listened
like
one
stupefied
,
till
he
brought
his
recital
to
a
close
,
and
then
asking
where
the
house
in
which
she
had
died
was
situated
,
rushed
out
of
the
room
,
and
made
his
way
,
he
knew
not
<EOS>
how
,
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
His
brain
seemed
on
fire
,
and
he
ran
so
quickly
that
his
feet
appeared
scarcely
to
touch
the
ground
.
<EOS>
A
few
seconds
brought
him
to
London
Bridge
.
<EOS>
He
crossed
it
,
and
turning
down
the
street
on
the
left
,
had
nearly
reached
the
house
to
which
he
had
been
directed
,
when
his
career
was
suddenly
checked
.
<EOS>
The
gate
of
the
court
-
yard
was
opened
,
and
two
men
,
evidently
,
from
their
apparel
,
buriers
of
the
dead
,
issued
from
it
.
<EOS>
They
carried
a
long
narrow
board
between
them
,
with
a
body
wrapped
in
a
white
sheet
placed
upon
it
.
<EOS>
A
freezing
horror
rooted
Leonard
to
the
spot
where
he
stood
.
<EOS>
He
could
neither
move
nor
utter
a
cry
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
proceeded
with
their
burden
towards
the
adjoining
habitation
,
which
was
marked
with
a
fatal
red
cross
and
inscription
.
<EOS>
Before
it
stood
the
dead
-
cart
,
partly
filled
with
corpses
.
<EOS>
The
foremost
burier
carried
a
lantern
,
but
he
held
it
so
low
that
its
light
did
not
fall
upon
his
burden
.
<EOS>
Leonard
,
however
,
did
not
require
to
see
the
body
to
know
whose
it
was
.
<EOS>
The
moon
was
at
its
full
,
and
shed
a
ghastly
light
over
the
group
,
and
a
large
bat
wheeled
in
narrow
circles
round
the
dead
-
cart
.
 
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
door
of
the
house
,
the
burier
set
down
the
lantern
near
the
body
of
a
young
man
which
had
just
been
thrust
forth
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
,
Chowles
,
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
,
stepped
out
upon
the
threshold
.
<EOS>
"
Who
have
you
got
,
Jonas
?
"
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
,
"
replied
the
hindmost
burier
.
<EOS>
"
We
entered
yon
large
house
,
the
door
of
which
stood
open
,
and
in
one
of
the
rooms
found
,
an
old
woman
in
a
fainting
state
,
and
the
body
of
this
young
girl
,
wrapped
in
a
sheet
,
and
ready
for
the
cart
.
<EOS>
So
we
clapped
it
on
the
board
,
and
brought
it
away
with
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
did
right
,
"
replied
Chowles
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whose
body
it
is
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
held
up
his
lantern
,
and
unfastening
it
,
threw
the
light
full
upon
the
face
.
<EOS>
The
features
were
pale
as
marble
;
calm
in
their
expression
,
and
like
those
of
one
wrapped
in
placid
slumber
.
<EOS>
The
long
fair
hair
hung
over
the
side
of
the
board
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
sad
and
touching
sight
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
as
I
am
a
living
man
,
it
is
the
grocer
's
daughter
,
Amabel,--somewhile
Countess
of
Rochester
!
"
exclaimed
Chowles
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
earl
,
suddenly
rushing
from
behind
a
building
where
he
had
hitherto
remained
concealed
.
<EOS>
"
Whither
are
you
about
to
take
her
?
<EOS>
Set
her
down
--
set
her
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hinder
them
not
,
my
lord
,
"
vociferated
another
person
,
also
appearing
on
the
scene
with
equal
suddenness
.
<EOS>
"
Place
her
in
the
cart
,
"
cried
Solomon
Eagle
--
for
he
<EOS>
it
was
--
to
the
bearers
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
just
punishment
upon
you
,
my
lord
,
"
he
added
to
Rochester
,
as
his
injunctions
were
obeyed--"oppose
them
not
in
their
duty
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
the
earl
's
power
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Like
Leonard
,
he
was
transfixed
with
horror
.
<EOS>
The
other
bodies
were
soon
placed
in
the
cart
,
and
it
was
put
in
motion
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
the
apprentice
's
suspended
faculties
were
for
an
instant
--
and
an
instant
only
--
restored
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
uttered
a
piercing
cry
,
and
staggering
forward
,
fell
senseless
on
the
ground
.

DECEMBER

1665
.
  
<EOS>
I.
 
<EOS>
THE
DECLINE
OF
THE
PLAGUE
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
two
months
must
be
passed
over
in
silence
.
<EOS>
During
that
time
,
the
pestilence
had
so
greatly
abated
as
no
longer
to
occasion
alarm
to
those
who
had
escaped
its
ravages
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
mentioned
that
the
distemper
arrived
at
its
height
about
the
10th
of
September
,
and
though
for
the
two
following
weeks
the
decline
was
scarcely
perceptible
,
yet
it
had
already
commenced
.
<EOS>
On
the
last
week
in
that
fatal
month
,
when
all
hope
had
been
abandoned
,
the
bills
of
mortality
suddenly
decreased
in
number
to
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
thirty
-
four
.
<EOS>
And
this
fortunate
change
could
not
be
attributed
to
the
want
of
materials
to
act
upon
,
for
the
sick
continued
as
numerous
as
before
,
while
the
deaths
were
less
frequent
.
<EOS>
In
the
next
week
there
was
a
further
decrease
of
six
hundred
;
in
the
next
after
that
of
six
hundred
;
and
so
on
till
the
end
of
October
,
when
,
the
cold
weather
setting
in
,
the
amount
was
reduced
to
nearly
one
thousand
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
when
the
distemper
began
to
lose
somewhat
of
its
malignancy
,
a
few
scared
individuals
appeared
in
the
streets
,
but
carefully
shunned
each
other
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
days
,
however
,
considerable
numbers
joined
them
,
and
for
the
first
time
for
nearly
three
months
there
was
something
like
life
abroad
.
<EOS>
It
is
astonishing
how
soon
hope
and
confidence
are
revived
.
<EOS>
Now
that
it
could
no
longer
be
doubted
that
the
plague
was
on
the
decline
,
it
seemed
as
if
a
miracle
had
been
performed
in
favour
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
Houses
were
opened
--
shopkeepers
resumed
their
business
--
and
it
was
a
marvel
to
every
one
that
so
many
persons
were
left
alive
.
<EOS>
Dejection
and
despair
of
the
darkest
kind
were
succeeded
by
frenzied
delight
,
and
no
bound
was
put
to
the
public
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Strangers
stopped
each
other
in
the
streets
,
and
conversed
together
like
old
friends
.
<EOS>
The
bells
,
that
had
grown
hoarse
with
tolling
funerals
,
were
now
cracked
with
joyous
peals
.
<EOS>
The
general
joy
extended
even
to
the
sick
,
and
many
,
buoyed
up
by
hope
,
recovered
,
when
in
the
former
season
of
despondency
they
would
inevitably
have
perished
.
<EOS>
All
fear
of
the
plague
seemed
to
vanish
with
the
flying
disorder
.
<EOS>
Those
who
were
scarcely
out
of
danger
joined
in
the
throng
,
and
it
was
no
uncommon
sight
to
see
men
with
bandages
round
their
necks
,
or
supported
by
staves
and
crutches
,
shaking
hands
with
their
friends
,
and
even
embracing
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
consequence
of
this
incautious
conduct
may
be
easily
foreseen
.
<EOS>
The
plague
had
received
too
severe
a
check
to
burst
forth
anew
;
but
it
spread
further
than
it
otherwise
would
have
done
,
and
attacked
many
persons
,
who
but
for
their
own
imprudence
would
have
escaped
.
<EOS>
Amongst
others
,
a
barber
in
Saint
Martin's
-
le
-
Grand
,
who
had
fled
into
the
country
in
August
,
returned
to
his
shop
in
the
middle
of
October
,
and
,
catching
the
disorder
from
one
of
his
customers
,
perished
with
the
whole
of
his
family
.
 
<EOS>
But
these
,
and
several
other
equally
fatal
instances
,
produced
no
effect
on
the
multitude
.
<EOS>
Fully
persuaded
that
the
virulence
of
the
disorder
was
exhausted
--
as
,
indeed
,
appeared
to
be
the
case
--
they
gave
free
scope
to
their
satisfaction
,
which
was
greater
than
was
ever
experienced
by
the
inhabitants
of
a
besieged
city
reduced
by
famine
to
the
last
strait
of
despair
,
and
suddenly
restored
to
freedom
and
plenty
.
<EOS>
The
more
pious
part
of
the
community
thronged
to
the
churches
,
from
which
they
had
been
so
long
absent
,
and
returned
thanks
for
their
unexpected
deliverance
.
<EOS>
Others
,
who
had
been
terrified
into
seriousness
and
devotion
,
speedily
forgot
their
former
terrors
,
and
resumed
their
old
habits
.
<EOS>
Profaneness
and
debauchery
again
prevailed
,
and
the
taverns
were
as
well
filled
as
the
churches
.
<EOS>
Solomon
Eagle
continued
his
midnight
courses
through
the
streets
;
but
he
could
no
longer
find
an
audience
as
before
.
<EOS>
Those
who
listened
to
him
only
laughed
at
his
denunciations
of
a
new
judgment
,
and
told
him
his
preachings
and
prophesyings
were
now
completely
out
of
date
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
numbers
of
those
who
had
quitted
London
having
returned
to
it
,
the
streets
began
to
resume
their
wonted
appearance
.
<EOS>
The
utmost
care
was
taken
by
the
authorities
to
cleanse
and
purify
the
houses
,
in
order
to
remove
all
chance
of
keeping
alive
the
infection
.
<EOS>
Every
room
in
every
habitation
where
a
person
had
died
of
the
plague
--
and
there
were
few
that
had
escaped
the
visitation
--
was
ordered
to
be
whitewashed
,
and
the
strongest
fumigations
were
employed
to
remove
the
pestilential
effluvia
.
<EOS>
Brimstone
,
resin
,
and
pitch
were
burnt
in
the
houses
of
the
poor
;
benjamin
,
myrrh
,
and
other
more
expensive
perfumes
in
those
of
the
rich
;
while
vast
quantities
of
powder
were
consumed
in
creating
blasts
to
carry
off
the
foul
air
.
<EOS>
Large
and
constant
fires
were
kept
in
all
the
houses
,
and
several
were
burnt
down
in
consequence
of
the
negligence
of
their
owners
.
 
<EOS>
All
goods
,
clothes
,
and
bedding
,
capable
of
harbouring
infection
,
were
condemned
to
be
publicly
burned
,
and
vast
bonfires
were
lighted
in
Finsbury
Fields
and
elsewhere
,
into
which
many
hundred
cart
-
loads
of
such
articles
were
thrown
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
Chowles
's
hoard
,
except
the
plate
,
which
he
managed
,
with
Judith
's
aid
,
to
carry
off
and
conceal
in
certain
hiding
-
places
in
the
vaults
of
Saint
Faith
's
,
was
taken
from
the
house
in
Nicholas
-
lane
,
and
cast
into
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
The
cathedral
was
one
of
the
first
places
ordered
to
be
purified
.
<EOS>
The
pallets
of
the
sick
were
removed
and
burned
,
and
all
the
stains
and
impurities
with
which
its
floor
and
columns
were
polluted
were
cleansed
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
left
untried
to
free
it
from
infection
.
<EOS>
It
was
washed
throughout
with
vinegar
,
fumigated
with
the
strongest
scents
,
and
several
large
barrels
of
pitch
were
set
fire
to
in
the
aisles
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
shall
undergo
another
species
of
purification
,
"
said
Solomon
Eagle
,
who
was
present
during
these
proceedings
;
"
one
that
shall
search
every
nook
within
it
--
shall
embrace
all
those
columns
,
and
pierce
every
crack
and
crevice
in
those
sculptured
ornaments
;
and
then
,
and
not
till
then
,
will
it
be
thoroughly
cleansed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
During
all
this
time
the
grocer
had
not
opened
his
dwelling
.
<EOS>
The
wisdom
of
this
plan
was
now
made
fully
apparent
.
<EOS>
The
plague
was
declining
fast
,
and
not
an
inmate
of
his
house
had
been
attacked
by
it
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
the
melancholy
occurrence
,
he
had
been
informed
by
Doctor
Hodges
of
Amabel
's
death
;
but
the
humane
physician
concealed
from
him
the
painful
circumstances
under
which
it
occurred
.
<EOS>
It
required
all
Mr.
Bloundel
's
fortitude
to
support
him
under
the
shock
of
this
intelligence
,
and
he
did
not
communicate
the
afflicting
tidings
to
his
wife
until
he
had
prepared
her
for
their
reception
.
<EOS>
But
she
bore
them
better
than
he
had
anticipated
;
and
though
she
mourned
her
daughter
deeply
and
truly
,
she
appeared
completely
resigned
to
the
loss
.
<EOS>
Sorrow
pervaded
the
whole
household
for
some
weeks
;
and
the
grocer
,
who
never
relaxed
his
system
,
shrouded
his
sufferings
under
the
appearance
of
additional
austerity
of
manner
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
a
great
consolation
to
him
to
see
Leonard
Holt
;
but
the
apprentice
had
disappeared
;
and
even
Doctor
Hodges
could
give
no
account
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
One
night
,
in
the
middle
of
November
,
Mr.
Bloundel
signified
to
his
wife
his
intention
of
going
forth
,
early
on
the
following
morning
,
to
satisfy
himself
that
the
plague
was
really
abating
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
after
he
had
finished
his
devotions
,
and
broken
his
fast
,
he
put
his
design
into
execution
.
<EOS>
His
first
act
,
after
locking
the
door
behind
him
,
which
he
did
as
a
measure
of
precaution
,
was
to
fall
on
his
knees
and
offer
up
prayers
to
Heaven
for
his
signal
preservation
.
<EOS>
He
then
arose
,
and
,
stepping
into
the
middle
of
the
street
,
gazed
at
the
habitation
which
had
formed
his
prison
and
refuge
for
nearly
six
months
.
<EOS>
There
it
was
,
with
its
shutters
closed
and
barred
--
a
secure
asylum
,
with
all
alive
within
it
,
while
every
other
dwelling
in
the
street
was
desolate
.
 
<EOS>
The
grocer
's
sensations
were
novel
and
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
His
first
impulse
was
to
enjoy
his
newly
-
recovered
freedom
,
and
to
put
himself
into
active
motion
.
<EOS>
But
he
checked
the
feeling
as
sinful
,
and
proceeded
along
the
street
at
a
slow
pace
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
meet
a
single
person
,
until
he
reached
Cheapside
,
where
he
found
matters
completely
changed
.
<EOS>
Several
shops
were
already
opened
,
and
there
were
a
few
carts
and
other
vehicles
tracking
their
way
through
the
broad
and
yet
grass
-
grown
street
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
clear
,
frosty
morning
,
and
there
was
a
healthful
feel
in
the
bracing
atmosphere
that
produced
an
exhilarating
effect
on
the
spirits
.
<EOS>
The
grocer
pursued
his
course
through
the
middle
of
the
street
,
carefully
avoiding
all
contact
with
such
persons
as
he
encountered
,
though
he
cordially
returned
their
greetings
,
and
wandered
on
,
scarcely
knowing
whither
he
was
going
,
but
deeply
interested
in
all
he
beheld
.
 
<EOS>
The
aspect
of
the
city
was
indeed
most
curious
.
<EOS>
The
houses
were
for
the
most
part
unoccupied
--
the
streets
overgrown
with
grass
--
while
every
object
,
animate
and
inanimate
,
bore
some
marks
of
the
recent
visitation
.
<EOS>
Still
,
all
looked
hopeful
,
and
the
grocer
could
not
doubt
that
the
worst
was
past
.
<EOS>
The
different
demeanour
of
the
various
individuals
he
met
struck
him
.
<EOS>
Now
he
passed
a
young
man
whistling
cheerily
,
who
saluted
him
,
and
said
,
"
I
have
lost
my
sweetheart
by
the
plague
,
but
I
shall
soon
get
another
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
next
was
a
grave
man
,
who
muttered
,
"
I
have
lost
all
,
"
and
walked
pensively
on
.
<EOS>
Then
came
others
in
different
moods
;
but
all
concurred
in
thinking
that
the
plague
was
at
an
end
;
and
the
grocer
derived
additional
confirmation
of
the
fact
from
meeting
numerous
carts
and
other
vehicles
bringing
families
back
to
their
houses
from
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
After
roaming
about
for
several
hours
,
and
pondering
on
all
he
saw
,
he
found
himself
before
the
great
western
entrance
of
Saint
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
It
chanced
to
be
the
morning
on
which
the
pallets
and
bedding
were
brought
forth
,
and
he
watched
the
proceeding
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
All
had
been
removed
,
and
he
was
about
to
depart
,
when
he
perceived
a
person
seated
on
a
block
of
stone
,
not
far
from
him
,
whom
he
instantly
recognised
.
<EOS>
"
Leonard
,
"
he
cried--"Leonard
Holt
,
is
it
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
addressed
,
and
in
these
familiar
tones
,
the
apprentice
looked
up
,
and
Mr.
Bloundel
started
at
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
him
.
<EOS>
Profound
grief
was
written
in
every
line
of
his
thin
and
haggard
countenance
;
his
eyes
were
hollow
,
and
had
the
most
melancholy
expression
imaginable
;
and
his
flesh
was
wasted
away
from
the
bone
.
<EOS>
He
looked
the
very
image
of
hopeless
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
find
you
in
this
state
,
Leonard
,
"
said
the
grocer
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
commiseration
;
"
but
I
am
well
aware
of
the
cause
.
<EOS>
I
myself
have
suffered
severely
;
but
I
deem
it
my
duty
to
control
my
affliction
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
would
_
control
it
,
if
it
were
possible
,
Mr.
Bloundel
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
But
hope
is
dead
in
my
breast
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
happy
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
otherwise
,
"
replied
the
grocer
,
kindly
.
"
<EOS>
Your
trials
have
been
very
great
,
and
so
were
those
of
the
poor
creature
we
both
of
us
deplore
.
<EOS>
But
she
is
at
peace
,
and
therefore
we
need
not
lament
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
"
exclaimed
Leonard
,
mournfully
,
"
I
am
now
only
anxious
to
rejoin
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
selfish
,
if
not
sinful
,
to
grieve
in
this
way
,
"
rejoined
Mr.
Bloundel
,
somewhat
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
bear
your
sorrows
like
a
man
.
<EOS>
Come
home
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
a
father
to
you
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
do
not
hesitate
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
no
refusal
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
took
Leonard
's
arm
,
and
led
him
in
the
direction
of
Wood
-
street
.
<EOS>
Nothing
passed
between
them
on
the
way
,
nor
did
Leonard
evince
any
further
emotion
until
he
entered
the
door
of
the
grocer
's
dwelling
,
when
he
uttered
a
deep
groan
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bloundel
was
greatly
affected
at
seeing
him
,
as
were
the
rest
of
the
family
,
and
abundance
of
tears
were
shed
by
all
,
except
Mr.
Bloundel
,
who
maintained
his
customary
stoical
demeanour
throughout
the
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
Satisfied
that
the
pestilence
had
not
declined
sufficiently
to
warrant
him
in
opening
his
house
,
the
grocer
determined
to
await
the
result
of
a
few
weeks
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
that
very
night
,
he
had
reason
to
think
he
had
defeated
his
plans
by
precipitancy
.
<EOS>
While
sitting
after
prayers
with
his
family
,
he
was
seized
with
a
sudden
shivering
and
sickness
,
which
he
could
not
doubt
were
the
precursors
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
He
was
greatly
alarmed
,
but
did
not
lose
his
command
over
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
most
imprudent
,
"
he
said
,
"
in
thus
exposing
myself
to
infection
.
<EOS>
I
have
symptoms
of
the
plague
about
me
,
and
will
instantly
repair
to
one
of
the
upper
rooms
which
I
have
laid
aside
as
an
hospital
,
in
case
of
any
emergency
like
the
present
.
<EOS>
None
of
you
must
attend
me
.
<EOS>
Leonard
will
fetch
Doctor
Hodges
and
a
nurse
.
<EOS>
I
shall
then
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
Farewell
,
dear
wife
and
children
!
<EOS>
God
bless
you
all
,
and
watch
over
you
.
<EOS>
Remember
me
in
your
prayers
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
arose
and
walked
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
His
wife
and
eldest
son
would
have
assisted
him
,
but
he
motioned
them
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
with
you
,
sir
,
"
cried
Leonard
,
who
had
arisen
with
the
others
;
"
I
will
nurse
you
;
my
life
is
of
little
consequence
,
and
I
can
not
be
more
satisfactorily
employed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
grocer
reluctantly
assented
,
and
the
apprentice
assisted
him
upstairs
,
and
helped
to
place
him
in
bed
.
<EOS>
No
plague
-
token
could
be
found
about
his
person
,
but
as
the
same
alarming
symptoms
still
continued
,
Leonard
administered
such
remedies
as
he
thought
needful
,
and
then
went
in
search
of
Doctor
Hodges
.
 
<EOS>
On
reaching
Watling
-
street
,
he
found
Doctor
Hodges
about
to
retire
to
rest
.
<EOS>
The
worthy
physician
was
greatly
distressed
by
the
apprentice
's
account
of
his
master
's
illness
;
but
was
somewhat
reassured
when
the
symptoms
were
more
minutely
described
to
him
.
<EOS>
While
preparing
certain
medicines
,
and
arming
himself
with
his
surgical
implements
,
he
questioned
Leonard
as
to
the
cause
of
his
long
disappearance
.
"
<EOS>
Having
seen
nothing
of
you
,
"
he
said
,
"
since
the
fatal
night
when
our
poor
Amabel
's
sorrows
were
ended
,
I
began
to
feel
very
apprehensive
on
your
account
.
<EOS>
Where
have
you
been
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
"
though
the
relation
will
be
like
opening
my
wounds
afresh
.
<EOS>
On
recovering
from
the
terrible
shock
I
had
received
,
I
found
myself
stretched
upon
a
bed
in
a
house
whither
<EOS>
I
had
been
conveyed
by
Rainbird
the
watchman
,
who
had
discovered
me
lying
in
a
state
of
insensibility
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
For
nearly
a
week
I
continued
delirious
,
and
should
,
probably
,
have
lost
my
senses
altogether
but
for
the
attentions
of
the
watchman
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
was
able
to
move
,
I
wandered
to
the
lesser
plague
-
pit
,
in
Finsbury
Fields
,
you
will
guess
with
what
intent
.
<EOS>
My
heart
seemed
breaking
,
and
I
thought
I
should
pour
forth
my
very
soul
in
grief
,
as
I
gazed
into
that
dreadful
gulf
,
and
thought
she
was
there
interred
.
<EOS>
Still
my
tears
were
a
relief
.
<EOS>
Every
evening
,
for
a
month
,
I
went
to
that
sad
spot
,
and
remained
there
till
daybreak
admonished
me
to
return
to
Rainbird
's
dwelling
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
he
was
seized
by
the
distemper
;
but
though
I
nursed
him
,
voluntarily
exposing
myself
to
infection
,
and
praying
to
be
carried
off
,
I
remained
untouched
.
<EOS>
Poor
Rainbird
died
;
and
having
seen
his
body
thrown
into
the
pit
,
I
set
off
into
Berkshire
,
and
after
three
days
'
toilsome
travel
on
foot
,
reached
Ashdown
Park
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
melancholy
pleasure
to
behold
the
abode
where
she
I
had
loved
passed
her
last
few
days
of
happiness
,
and
where
I
had
been
near
her
.
<EOS>
Her
aunt
,
good
Mrs.
Buscot
,
though
overwhelmed
by
affliction
at
the
sad
tidings
I
brought
her
,
received
me
with
the
utmost
kindness
,
and
tried
to
console
me
.
<EOS>
My
sorrow
,
however
,
was
too
deeply
seated
to
be
removed
.
<EOS>
Wandering
over
the
downs
,
I
visited
Mrs.
Compton
at
Kingston
Lisle
,
from
whose
house
Amabel
was
carried
off
by
the
perfidious
earl
.
<EOS>
She
,
also
,
received
me
with
kindness
,
and
strove
,
like
Mrs.
Buscot
,
to
comfort
me
,
and
,
like
her
,
ineffectually
.
<EOS>
Finding
my
strength
declining
,
and
persuaded
that
my
days
were
drawing
to
a
close
,
I
retraced
my
steps
to
London
,
hoping
to
find
a
final
resting
-
place
near
her
I
had
loved
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
,
indeed
,
faithful
to
the
grave
,
Leonard
,
"
said
the
physician
,
brushing
away
a
tear
;
"
and
I
never
heard
or
read
of
affection
stronger
than
yours
.
<EOS>
Sorrow
is
a
great
purifier
,
and
you
will
come
out
all
the
better
for
your
trial
.
<EOS>
You
are
yet
young
,
and
though
you
never
can
love
as
you
_
have
_
loved
,
a
second
time
,
your
heart
is
not
utterly
seared
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Utterly
,
sir
,
"
echoed
Leonard
,
"
utterly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
think
so
,
now
,
"
rejoined
the
physician
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
find
it
otherwise
hereafter
.
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
of
one
person
who
has
suffered
almost
as
much
from
your
absence
as
you
have
done
for
the
loss
of
Amabel
.
<EOS>
The
Lady
Isabella
Argentine
has
made
constant
inquiries
after
you
;
and
though
I
should
be
the
last
person
to
try
to
rouse
you
from
your
present
state
of
despondency
,
by
awakening
hopes
of
alliance
with
the
sister
of
a
proud
noble
,
yet
it
may
afford
you
consolation
to
know
that
she
still
cherishes
the
warmest
regard
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
grateful
to
her
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
sadly
,
but
without
exhibiting
any
other
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
dear
to
Amabel
,
and
therefore
will
be
ever
dear
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
fain
know
,
"
he
added
,
his
brow
suddenly
contracting
,
and
his
lip
quivering
,
"
what
has
become
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
married
a
wealthy
heiress
,
the
fair
Mistress
Mallet
,
"
replied
Hodges
.
 
<EOS>
"
Married
,
and
so
soon
!
"
cried
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
has
quite
forgotten
his
victim
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Apparently
so
,
"
replied
the
doctor
,
with
an
expression
of
disgust
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
it
was
for
one
who
so
lightly
regarded
her
that
she
sacrificed
herself
,
"
groaned
Leonard
,
his
head
dropping
upon
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
cried
Hodges
,
taking
his
arm
,
and
leading
him
out
of
the
room
;
"
we
must
go
and
look
after
your
master
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
they
made
the
best
of
their
way
to
Wood
-
street
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
grocer
's
house
,
they
went
upstairs
,
and
Hodges
immediately
pronounced
Mr.
Bloundel
to
be
suffering
from
a
slight
feverish
attack
,
which
a
sudorific
powder
would
remove
.
<EOS>
Having
administered
the
remedy
,
he
descended
to
the
lower
room
to
allay
the
fears
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bloundel
received
the
happy
tidings
with
tears
of
joy
,
and
the
doctor
remained
a
short
time
to
condole
with
her
on
the
loss
she
had
sustained
.
<EOS>
The
good
dame
wept
bitterly
on
hearing
the
whole
particulars
,
with
which
she
had
been
hitherto
unacquainted
,
attending
her
daughter
's
untimely
death
,
but
she
soon
regained
her
composure
.
<EOS>
They
then
spoke
of
Leonard
,
who
had
remained
above
with
his
master,--of
his
blighted
hopes
,
and
seemingly
incurable
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
is
true
love
,
indeed
,
doctor
,
"
sighed
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
Pity
it
is
that
it
could
not
be
requited
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
how
it
is
,
"
rejoined
Hodges
,
"
and
will
not
question
the
decrees
of
our
All
-
Wise
Ruler
,
but
the
strongest
affection
seldom
,
if
ever
,
meets
a
return
.
<EOS>
Leonard
himself
was
insensible
to
the
devotion
of
one
,
of
whom
I
may
say
,
without
disparagement
to
our
poor
Amabel
,
that
she
was
,
in
my
opinion
,
her
superior
in
beauty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
does
this
person
love
him
still
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mrs.
Bloundel
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
because
I
regard
him
as
a
son
,
and
earnestly
desire
to
restore
him
to
happiness
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
"
exclaimed
Hodges
<EOS>
,
"
there
are
obstacles
in
the
way
that
can
not
be
removed
.
<EOS>
We
must
endeavour
to
cure
him
of
his
grief
in
some
other
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
conversation
then
dropped
,
and
Hodges
took
his
leave
,
promising
to
return
on
the
morrow
,
and
assuring
Mrs.
Bloundel
that
she
need
be
under
no
further
apprehension
about
her
husband
.
<EOS>
And
so
it
proved
.
<EOS>
The
powders
removed
all
the
grocer
's
feverish
symptoms
,
and
when
Doctor
Hodges
made
his
appearance
the
next
day
,
he
found
him
dressed
,
and
ready
to
go
downstairs
.
<EOS>
Having
received
the
physician
's
congratulations
on
his
entire
recovery
,
Mr.
Bloundel
inquired
from
him
when
he
thought
he
might
with
entire
safety
open
his
shop
.
<EOS>
Hodges
considered
for
a
moment
,
and
then
replied
,
"
I
do
not
see
any
great
risk
in
doing
so
now
,
but
I
would
advise
you
to
defer
the
step
for
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
I
would
,
also
,
recommend
you
to
take
the
whole
of
your
family
for
a
short
time
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
Pure
air
and
change
of
scene
are
absolutely
necessary
after
their
long
confinement
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Farmer
Wingfield
,
of
Kensal
-
Green
,
who
sheltered
us
on
our
way
down
to
Ashdown
Park
,
will
,
I
am
sure
,
receive
you
,
"
observed
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
you
can
not
go
to
a
better
place
,
"
rejoined
the
physician
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
think
of
it
,
"
returned
Mr.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
And
leading
the
way
downstairs
,
he
was
welcomed
by
his
wife
and
children
with
the
warmest
demonstrations
of
delight
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
fears
,
you
perceive
,
were
groundless
,
"
he
remarked
to
Mrs.
Bloundel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
be
praised
,
they
were
so
!
"
<EOS>
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
entreat
you
not
to
go
forth
again
till
all
danger
is
at
an
end
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Rest
assured
I
will
not
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
Doctor
Hodges
took
his
leave
,
and
had
already
reached
the
street
-
door
,
when
he
was
arrested
by
Patience
,
who
inquired
with
much
anxiety
whether
he
knew
anything
of
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
"
Make
yourself
easy
about
him
,
child
,
"
replied
the
doctor
;
"
I
am
pretty
sure
he
is
safe
and
sound
.
<EOS>
He
has
had
the
plague
,
certainly
;
but
he
left
the
hospital
at
Saint
Paul
's
cured
.
 
<EOS>
"
O
then
I
_
shall
_
see
him
again
,
"
cried
Patience
,
joyfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Poor
dear
little
fellow
,
it
would
break
my
heart
to
lose
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
inquiries
about
him
,
"
rejoined
Hodges
,
"
and
if
I
can
find
him
,
will
send
him
home
.
"
<EOS>
And
without
waiting
to
receive
the
kitchen
-
maid
's
thanks
,
he
departed
.
 
<EOS>
For
some
days
the
grocer
continued
to
pursue
pretty
nearly
the
same
line
of
conduct
that
he
had
adopted
during
the
height
of
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
neglect
to
make
preparations
for
resuming
his
business
;
and
here
Leonard
was
of
material
assistance
to
him
.
<EOS>
They
often
spoke
of
Amabel
,
and
Mr.
Bloundel
strove
,
by
every
argument
he
was
master
of
,
to
remove
the
weight
of
affliction
under
which
his
apprentice
laboured
.
<EOS>
He
so
far
succeeded
that
Leonard
's
health
improved
,
though
he
still
seemed
a
prey
to
secret
sorrow
.
<EOS>
Things
were
in
this
state
,
when
one
day
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
street
-
door
,
and
the
summons
being
answered
by
the
grocer
's
eldest
son
,
Stephen
,
he
returned
with
the
intelligence
that
a
person
was
without
who
desired
to
see
Patience
.
<EOS>
After
some
consideration
,
Mr.
Bloundel
summoned
the
kitchen
-
maid
,
and
told
her
she
might
admit
the
stranger
into
the
passage
,
and
hear
what
he
had
to
say
.
<EOS>
Patience
hastened
with
a
beating
heart
to
the
door
,
expecting
to
learn
some
tidings
of
Blaize
,
and
opening
it
,
admitted
a
man
wrapped
in
a
large
cloak
and
having
a
broad
-
leaved
hat
pulled
over
his
brows
.
<EOS>
Stepping
into
the
passage
,
he
threw
aside
the
cloak
and
raised
the
hat
,
discovering
the
figure
and
features
of
Pillichody
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
brings
you
here
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Patience
,
in
alarm
,
and
glancing
over
her
shoulder
to
see
whether
any
one
observed
them
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
brought
you
news
of
Blaize
,
"
returned
the
bully
.
<EOS>
"
But
how
charmingly
you
look
.
<EOS>
By
the
coral
lips
of
Venus
!
<EOS>
your
long
confinement
has
added
to
your
attractions
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
my
attractions
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Patience
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Blaize
?
<EOS>
Why
did
he
not
come
with
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
"
replied
Pillichody
,
shaking
his
head
in
a
melancholy
manner
,
"
he
could
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Could
not
!
"
<EOS>
half
screamed
Patience
.
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
question
me
,
"
replied
Pillichody
,
feigning
to
brush
away
a
tear
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
my
friend
,
and
I
would
rather
banish
him
from
my
memory
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
your
beauty
transports
me
so
,
that
,
by
the
treasures
of
Croesus
!
<EOS>
I
would
rather
have
you
without
a
crown
than
the
wealthiest
widow
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
n't
talk
nonsense
to
me
in
this
way
,
"
sobbed
Patience
"
I
'm
not
in
the
humour
for
it
.
"
 
"
Nonsense
!
"
echoed
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
I
swear
to
you
I
am
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
By
Cupid
!
<EOS>
I
am
ravished
with
your
charms
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
would
have
seized
her
hand
,
but
Patience
hastily
withdrew
it
;
and
,
provoked
at
his
impertinence
,
dealt
him
a
sound
box
on
the
ear
.
<EOS>
As
she
did
this
,
she
thought
she
heard
a
suppressed
laugh
near
her
,
and
looked
round
,
but
could
see
no
one
.
<EOS>
The
sound
certainly
did
not
proceed
from
Pillichody
,
for
he
looked
very
red
and
very
angry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
repeat
this
affront
,
mistress
,
"
he
said
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
bear
anything
but
a
blow
from
your
sex
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
tell
me
what
has
become
of
Blaize
,
"
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
no
longer
spare
your
feelings
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
defunct
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Defunct
!
"
echoed
Patience
,
with
a
scream
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
me!--I
shall
never
survive
it
--
I
shall
die
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
while
I
am
left
to
supply
his
place
,
"
cried
Pillichody
,
catching
her
in
his
arms
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Patience
,
contemptuously
;
"
I
would
not
have
you
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
Where
is
he
buried
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
plague
-
pit
,
"
replied
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
I
attended
him
during
his
illness
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
second
attack
of
the
disorder
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
of
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
he?--dear
little
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
did
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tell
her
,
'
he
cried
,
"
rejoined
Pillichody
,
"
'
that
my
last
thoughts
were
of
her
.
'
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Patience
,
hysterically
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tell
her
also
,
'
he
added
,
"
pursued
Pillichody
,
"
'
that
I
trust
she
will
fulfil
my
last
injunction
.
'
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
will
,
"
replied
Patience
.
<EOS>
"
Name
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
conjured
you
to
marry
me
,
"
replied
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
will
not
hesitate
to
comply
with
the
request
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
of
this
,
"
cried
Patience
.
<EOS>
"
Blaize
was
a
great
deal
too
jealous
to
bequeath
me
to
another
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Right
,
sweetheart
,
right
,
"
cried
the
individual
in
question
,
pushing
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
This
has
all
been
done
to
try
your
fidelity
.
<EOS>
I
am
now
fully
satisfied
with
your
attachment
;
and
am
ready
to
marry
you
whenever
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
this
was
all
a
trick
,
"
cried
Patience
,
pettishly
;
"
I
wish
I
had
known
it
,
I
would
have
retaliated
upon
you
nicely
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
,
Major
Pillichody
,
to
lend
a
helping
-
hand
in
such
a
ridiculous
affair
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
it
to
oblige
my
friend
Blaize
,
"
replied
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
agreed
between
us
that
if
you
showed
any
inconstancy
,
you
were
to
be
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Patience
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
advise
you
to
repeat
the
experiment
,
Mr.
Blaize
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
intend
to
do
so
,
my
angel
,
"
replied
the
porter
.
<EOS>
"
I
esteem
myself
the
happiest
and
most
fortunate
of
men
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
great
reason
to
do
so
,
"
observed
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
despair
of
supplanting
him
yet
,
"
he
muttered
to
himself
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
farewell
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
aloud
;
"
I
am
only
in
the
way
,
and
besides
,
I
have
no
particular
desire
to
encounter
Mr.
Bloundel
or
his
apprentice
;
"
and
winking
his
solitary
orb
significantly
at
Patience
,
he
strutted
away
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
<EOS>
he
took
that
opportunity
of
departing
,
for
the
lovers
'
raptures
were
instantly
afterwards
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
Mr.
Bloundel
,
who
was
greatly
delighted
to
see
the
porter
,
and
gave
him
a
hearty
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
sir
,
I
have
had
a
narrow
escape
,
"
cried
Blaize
,
"
and
never
more
expected
to
see
you
,
or
my
mother
,
or
Patience
.
<EOS>
I
_
have
_
had
the
plague
,
sir
,
and
a
terrible
disorder
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
heard
or
your
seizure
from
Leonard
Holt
,
"
replied
Mr.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
But
where
have
you
been
since
you
left
the
hospital
at
Saint
Paul
's
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
country
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Blaize
;
"
sometimes
at
one
farm
-
house
,
and
sometimes
at
another
.
<EOS>
I
only
returned
to
London
yesterday
,
and
met
an
old
friend
,
whom
I
begged
to
go
before
me
,
and
see
that
all
was
right
before
I
ventured
,
in
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
all
been
providentially
spared
,
"
observed
Mr.
Bloundel
,
"
and
you
will
find
your
mother
as
well
as
when
you
last
quitted
her
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
go
to
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
Blaize
obeyed
,
and
was
received
by
old
Josyna
with
a
scream
of
delight
.
<EOS>
Having
embraced
him
,
and
sobbed
over
him
,
she
ran
for
a
bottle
of
sack
,
and
poured
its
contents
down
his
throat
so
hastily
as
nearly
to
choke
him
.
<EOS>
She
then
spread
abundance
of
eatables
before
him
,
and
after
he
had
eaten
and
drank
his
full
,
offered
him
as
a
treat
a
little
of
the
plague
medicine
which
she
had
in
reserve
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
,
mother
,
"
replied
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
enough
of
_
that
_
.
<EOS>
But
if
there
should
be
a
box
of
rufuses
amongst
the
store
,
you
can
bring
it
,
as
I
think
a
couple
might
do
me
good
.
"
 
<EOS>
Three
days
after
this
event
,
the
apprentice
was
sent
forth
to
ascertain
the
precise
state
of
the
city
,
as
,
if
all
proved
favourable
,
the
grocer
proposed
to
open
his
house
on
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
Leonard
set
out
betimes
,
and
was
speedily
convinced
that
all
danger
was
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
A
severe
frost
had
set
in
,
and
had
completely
purified
the
air
.
<EOS>
For
the
last
few
days
there
had
been
no
deaths
of
the
plague
,
and
but
little
mortality
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
Leonard
traversed
several
of
the
main
streets
,
and
some
narrow
thoroughfares
,
and
found
evidences
of
restored
health
and
confidence
everywhere
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
there
were
many
houses
,
in
which
whole
families
had
been
swept
off
,
still
left
untenanted
.
<EOS>
But
these
were
only
memorials
of
the
past
calamity
,
and
could
not
be
referred
to
any
existing
danger
.
<EOS>
Before
returning
to
Wood
-
street
,
an
irresistible
impulse
led
him
to
Finsbury
Fields
.
<EOS>
He
passed
through
the
postern
east
of
Cripplegate
,
and
shaped
his
way
towards
the
lesser
plague
-
pit
.
<EOS>
The
sun
,
which
had
been
bright
all
the
morning
,
was
now
partially
obscured
;
the
air
had
grown
thick
,
and
a
little
snow
fell
.
<EOS>
The
ground
was
blackened
and
bound
by
the
hard
frost
,
and
the
stiffened
grass
felt
crisp
beneath
his
feet
.
<EOS>
Insensible
to
all
external
circumstances
,
he
hurried
forward
,
taking
the
most
direct
course
,
and
leaping
every
impediment
in
his
path
.
<EOS>
Having
crossed
several
fields
,
he
at
length
stood
before
a
swollen
heap
of
clay
,
round
which
a
wooden
railing
was
placed
.
<EOS>
Springing
over
the
enclosure
,
and
uttering
a
wild
cry
that
evinced
the
uncontrollable
anguish
of
his
breast
,
he
flung
himself
upon
the
mound
.
<EOS>
He
remained
for
some
time
in
the
deepest
affliction
,
and
was
at
last
roused
by
.
<EOS>
a
hand
laid
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
,
raising
himself
,
beheld
Thirlby
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
must
be
you
,
"
said
the
new
comer
,
in
accents
of
the
deepest
commiseration
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
visiting
yonder
plague
-
pit
for
the
same
melancholy
purpose
as
yourself,--to
mourn
over
my
lost
child
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
in
search
of
you
,
and
have
much
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
Will
you
meet
me
in
this
place
at
midnight
tomorrow
?
<EOS>
"
Leonard
signified
his
assent
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
in
danger
,
"
pursued
Thirlby
,
"
for
,
by
some
means
,
the
secret
of
my
existence
has
been
made
known
,
and
the
officers
of
justice
are
in
pursuit
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
that
Judith
Malmayns
is
my
betrayer
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
fail
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
,
"
returned
Leonard
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Thirlby
hurried
away
,
and
leaping
a
hedge
,
disappeared
from
view
.
 
<EOS>
Leonard
slowly
and
sorrowfully
returned
to
Wood
-
street
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
there
,
he
assured
his
master
that
he
might
with
entire
safety
open
his
house
,
as
he
proposed
,
on
the
morrow
;
and
Doctor
Hodges
,
who
visited
the
grocer
the
same
evening
,
confirmed
the
opinion
.
<EOS>
Early
,
therefore
,
the
next
morning
,
Mr.
Bloundel
summoned
his
family
to
prayers
;
and
after
pouring
forth
his
supplications
with
peculiar
fervour
and
solemnity
,
he
went
,
accompanied
by
them
all
,
and
threw
open
the
street
-
door
.
<EOS>
Again
,
kneeling
down
at
the
threshold
,
he
prayed
fervently
,
as
before
.
<EOS>
He
then
proceeded
to
remove
the
bars
and
shutters
from
the
windows
.
<EOS>
The
transition
from
gloom
and
darkness
to
bright
daylight
was
almost
overpowering
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
for
six
months
,
the
imprisoned
family
looked
forth
on
the
external
world
,
and
were
dazzled
and
bewildered
by
the
sight
.
<EOS>
The
grocer
himself
,
despite
his
sober
judgment
,
could
scarcely
believe
he
had
not
been
in
a
trance
during
the
whole
period
.
<EOS>
The
shop
was
scarcely
opened
before
it
was
filled
with
customers
,
and
Leonard
and
Stephen
were
instantly
employed
.
<EOS>
But
the
grocer
would
sell
nothing
.
<EOS>
To
those
who
asked
for
any
article
he
possessed
,
he
presented
them
with
it
,
but
would
receive
no
payment
.
 
<EOS>
He
next
dispatched
Blaize
to
bring
together
all
the
poor
he
could
find
,
and
distributed
among
them
the
remainder
of
his
store
--
his
casks
of
flour
,
his
salted
meat
,
his
cheeses
,
his
biscuits
,
his
wine
--
in
short
,
all
that
was
left
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
I
give
,
"
he
said
,
"
as
a
thanksgiving
to
the
Lord
,
and
as
a
humble
testimony
of
gratitude
for
my
signal
deliverance
.
"
  
<EOS>
II
.
 
<EOS>
THE
MIDNIGHT
MEETING
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
day
of
his
deliverance
being
spent
by
the
grocer
in
the
praiseworthy
manner
before
related
,
he
laid
his
head
upon
his
pillow
with
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
such
as
he
had
not
for
months
experienced
.
<EOS>
A
very
remarkable
dream
occurred
to
him
that
night
,
and
its
recollection
afterwards
afforded
him
the
greatest
consolation
.
<EOS>
While
thinking
of
Amabel
,
and
of
the
delight
her
presence
would
have
afforded
him
,
slumber
stole
upon
him
,
and
his
dreams
were
naturally
influenced
by
his
previous
meditations
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
to
him
that
he
was
alone
within
his
house
,
and
while
visiting
one
of
the
upper
rooms
,
which
had
formerly
been
appropriated
to
his
lost
daughter
,
he
noticed
a
small
door
in
the
wall
that
had
never
before
attracted
his
attention
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
pushed
against
it
,
and
yielding
to
the
touch
,
it
admitted
him
to
an
apartment
with
which
he
seemed
acquainted
,
though
he
could
not
recall
the
time
when
he
had
seen
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
large
and
gloomy
,
panelled
with
dark
and
lustrous
oak
,
and
filled
with
rich
but
decayed
furniture
.
<EOS>
At
the
further
end
stood
a
large
antique
bed
,
hung
round
with
tarnished
brocade
curtains
.
<EOS>
The
grocer
shuddered
at
the
sight
,
for
he
remembered
to
have
heard
Doctor
Hodges
assert
,
that
in
such
a
bed
,
and
in
such
a
room
as
this
,
his
daughter
had
breathed
her
last
.
<EOS>
Some
one
appeared
to
be
within
the
bed
,
and
rushing
forward
with
a
throbbing
heart
,
and
a
foreboding
of
what
was
to
follow
,
he
beheld
the
form
of
Amabel
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
there
she
was
,
with
features
like
those
she
wore
on
earth
,
but
clothed
with
such
celestial
beauty
,
and
bearing
the
impress
of
such
serene
happiness
,
that
the
grocer
felt
awe
-
struck
as
he
gazed
at
her
!
 
<EOS>
"
Approach
,
my
father
,
"
said
the
visionary
form
,
in
a
voice
so
musical
that
it
thrilled
through
his
frame--"approach
,
and
let
what
you
now
hear
be
for
ever
graven
upon
your
heart
.
<EOS>
Do
not
lament
me
more
,
but
rather
rejoice
that
I
am
removed
from
trouble
,
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
supreme
felicity
.
<EOS>
Such
a
state
you
will
yourself
attain
.
<EOS>
You
have
run
the
good
race
,
and
will
assuredly
reap
your
reward
.
<EOS>
Comfort
<EOS>
my
dear
mother
,
my
brothers
,
my
little
sister
,
with
the
assurance
of
what
I
tell
you
,
and
bid
them
dry
their
tears
.
<EOS>
I
can
now
read
the
secrets
of
all
hearts
,
and
know
how
true
was
Leonard
Holt
's
love
for
me
,
and
how
deep
and
sincere
is
his
present
sorrow
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
permitted
to
appear
to
him
as
I
now
appear
to
you
.
<EOS>
Often
have
I
heard
him
invoke
me
in
accents
of
the
wildest
despair
,
and
have
floated
past
him
on
the
midnight
breeze
,
but
could
neither
impart
consolation
to
him
nor
make
him
sensible
of
my
presence
,
because
his
grief
was
sinful
.
<EOS>
Bid
him
be
comforted
.
<EOS>
Bid
him
put
a
due
control
upon
his
feelings
.
<EOS>
Bid
him
open
his
heart
anew
,
and
he
shall
yet
be
happy
,
yet
love
again
,
and
have
his
love
requited
.
<EOS>
Farewell
,
dear
father
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
these
words
the
curtains
of
the
bed
closed
.
<EOS>
The
grocer
stretched
out
his
arm
to
draw
them
aside
,
and
in
the
effort
awoke
.
<EOS>
He
slept
no
more
that
night
,
but
dwelt
with
unutterable
delight
on
the
words
he
had
heard
.
<EOS>
On
rising
,
his
first
object
was
to
seek
out
Leonard
,
and
to
relate
his
vision
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
apprentice
listened
in
speechless
wonder
,
and
remained
for
some
time
lost
in
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
"
From
any
other
person
than
yourself
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
at
length
,
"
I
might
have
doubted
this
singular
story
,
but
coming
from
you
,
I
attach
implicit
credence
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
_
<EOS>
will
_
obey
your
sainted
daughter
's
injunctions
;
<EOS>
I
_
will
<EOS>
_
struggle
against
the
grief
that
overwhelms
me
,
and
will
try
to
hope
that
her
words
may
be
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
do
wisely
,
"
rejoined
Mr.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
breakfast
we
will
walk
together
to
the
farmhouse
you
spoke
of
at
Kensal
Green
,
and
if
its
owner
should
prove
willing
to
receive
my
family
for
a
few
weeks
,
I
will
remove
them
thither
at
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
applauded
his
master
's
resolution
,
expressing
his
firm
conviction
that
Farmer
Wingfield
would
readily
accede
to
the
proposal
,
and
the
rest
of
the
family
having
by
this
time
assembled
,
they
sat
down
to
breakfast
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
meal
was
over
,
Mr.
Bloundel
intrusted
the
care
of
the
shop
to
Stephen
and
Blaize
,
and
accompanied
by
Leonard
,
set
forth
.
<EOS>
On
the
way
to
the
west
end
of
the
town
,
the
grocer
met
one
or
two
of
his
old
friends
,
and
they
welcomed
each
other
like
men
risen
from
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Their
course
took
them
through
Saint
Giles
's
,
where
the
plague
had
raged
with
the
greatest
severity
,
and
where
many
houses
were
still
without
tenants
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
all
had
acted
as
I
have
done
,
"
sighed
the
grocer
,
as
he
gazed
at
these
desolate
habitations
,
"
<EOS>
how
many
lives
,
under
God
's
providence
,
would
have
been
saved
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
my
opinion
,
sir
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
"
you
owe
your
preservation
as
much
to
your
piety
as
to
your
prudence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
placed
my
trust
on
high
,
"
rejoined
the
grocer
,
"
and
have
not
been
forsaken
.
<EOS>
And
yet
many
evil
doers
have
escaped
;
amongst
others--
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
whom
you
mean
,
sir
,
"
interrupted
Leonard
,
with
some
fierceness
,
"
but
a
day
of
retribution
will
arrive
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
more
of
this
,
"
rejoined
the
grocer
,
severely
.
"
<EOS>
Remember
the
solemn
injunction
you
have
received
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
they
observed
a
horseman
,
richly
attired
,
and
followed
by
a
couple
of
attendants
,
riding
rapidly
towards
them
.
<EOS>
Both
instantly
recognised
him
.
<EOS>
The
apprentice
's
cheek
and
brow
flushed
with
anger
,
and
Mr.
Bloundel
had
much
ado
to
control
his
emotion
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
and
on
seeing
them
he
instantly
dismounted
,
and
flinging
his
bridle
to
one
of
the
attendants
,
advanced
towards
them
.
<EOS>
Noticing
the
fury
that
gleamed
in
Leonard
's
eyes
,
and
apprehending
some
violence
on
his
part
,
the
grocer
laid
his
hand
,
upon
his
arm
,
and
sternly
enjoined
him
to
calm
himself
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
earl
had
reached
them
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
tone
of
much
emotion
,
and
with
a
look
that
seemed
to
bespeak
contrition
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
that
you
had
opened
your
house
yesterday
,
and
was
about
to
call
upon
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
few
words
to
say
to
you
on
a
subject
painful
to
both
of
us
,
but
doubly
painful
to
me
--
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
decline
to
hear
them
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
grocer
,
coldly
;
"
nor
shall
you
ever
cross
my
threshold
again
with
my
consent
.
<EOS>
My
poor
child
is
now
at
peace
.
<EOS>
You
can
do
her
no
further
injury
,
and
must
settle
your
own
account
with
your
Maker
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
not
refuse
me
your
forgiveness
,
"
implored
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
every
reparation
in
my
power
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
_
can
_
make
none
,
"
replied
the
grocer
,
repelling
him
;
"
and
as
to
my
forgiveness
,
I
neither
refuse
it
nor
accord
it
.
<EOS>
I
pray
your
lordship
to
let
me
pass
.
<EOS>
The
sole
favour
I
ask
of
you
is
to
come
near
me
no
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
obey
you
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
"
he
added
to
Leonard
,
who
stood
by
,
regarding
him
with
a
look
of
deadly
animosity
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
give
you
a
piece
of
caution
.
<EOS>
Your
life
is
in
danger
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
easily
guess
from
whom
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
,
scornfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
mistake
,
"
rejoined
Rochester
;
"
you
have
nothing
to
apprehend
from
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
promised
to
meet
some
one
to
-
night
,
"
he
added
,
in
so
low
a
tone
as
to
be
inaudible
to
the
grocer
.
"
<EOS>
Do
not
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
lordship
's
warning
will
not
deter
me
,
"
rejoined
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
you
will
,
"
rejoined
Rochester
,
turning
away
.
<EOS>
And
springing
upon
his
horse
,
and
striking
his
spurs
into
his
side
,
he
dashed
off
,
while
Leonard
and
the
grocer
took
the
opposite
direction
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
half
an
hour
they
reached
the
little
village
of
Paddington
,
then
consisting
of
a
few
houses
,
but
now
one
of
the
most
populous
and
important
parishes
of
the
metropolis
,
and
speedily
gained
the
open
country
.
<EOS>
Even
at
this
dreary
season
the
country
had
charms
,
which
Mr.
Bloundel
,
after
his
long
confinement
,
could
fully
appreciate
.
<EOS>
His
eye
roamed
over
the
wide
prospect
;
and
the
leafless
trees
,
the
bare
hedges
,
and
the
frost
-
bound
fields
seemed
pleasant
in
his
sight
.
 
<EOS>
He
quickened
his
pace
,
and
being
wholly
indifferent
to
the
cold
,
greatly
enjoyed
the
exercise
.
<EOS>
Leonard
pointed
out
to
him
the
spots
where
the
fugitives
from
the
plague
had
pitched
their
tents
,
and
also
the
pest
-
house
near
Westbourne
Green
,
where
he
himself
had
been
received
during
his
second
attack
of
the
distemper
,
and
which
was
now
altogether
abandoned
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
they
mounted
the
hill
beyond
Kensal
Green
,
and
approached
the
farmhouse
.
<EOS>
Leonard
descried
Wingfield
near
one
of
the
barns
,
and
hailing
him
,
he
immediately
came
forward
.
<EOS>
On
being
informed
of
Mr.
Bloundel
's
desire
,
he
at
once
assented
,
and
taking
them
into
the
house
,
mentioned
the
matter
to
his
dame
,
who
was
quite
of
the
same
opinion
as
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
only
difference
between
us
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
to
Mr.
Bloundel
,
"
is
as
to
the
payment
you
propose
.
<EOS>
Now
I
will
take
none
--
not
a
farthing
.
<EOS>
Come
when
you
please
,
bring
whom
you
please
,
and
stay
as
long
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
offer
me
anything
if
you
would
not
offend
me
.
<EOS>
Recollect
,
"
he
added
,
the
moisture
forcing
itself
into
his
eyes
,
and
his
strong
clear
voice
becoming
husky
with
emotion
,
"
that
I
loved
your
daughter
for
her
resemblance
to
my
poor
child
.
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
is
gone
.
<EOS>
I
do
this
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
shook
the
worthy
man
warmly
by
the
hand
,
but
he
made
no
further
objection
,
resolved
in
his
own
mind
to
find
some
other
means
of
requiting
his
hospitality
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
agreed
that
the
grocer
should
bring
his
family
on
the
following
day
,
and
remain
there
for
a
month
;
and
every
other
arrangement
being
made
,
and
a
hearty
meal
partaken
of
,
he
cordially
thanked
his
host
,
and
returned
with
Leonard
to
Wood
-
street
.
 
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
efforts
to
resist
the
impression
produced
by
the
earl
's
warning
,
Leonard
could
not
banish
it
from
his
mind
;
and
though
he
did
not
for
a
moment
think
of
abandoning
his
purpose
,
he
resolved
to
attend
the
meeting
armed
.
<EOS>
He
told
Mr.
Bloundel
he
should
go
out
that
night
,
but
did
not
state
his
object
,
and
the
grocer
did
not
inquire
it
.
<EOS>
Blaize
sat
up
with
him
,
and
displayed
much
anxiety
to
know
whither
he
was
going
,
but
,
as
may
be
supposed
,
his
curiosity
was
not
gratified
.
<EOS>
As
the
clock
struck
eleven
,
Leonard
thrust
a
sword
into
his
girdle
,
and
arming
himself
furthermore
with
his
staff
,
proceeded
towards
the
door
,
and
bade
Blaize
lock
it
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
probably
be
back
in
a
couple
of
hours
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
went
forth
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
sit
up
for
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
where
he
is
going
!
"
<EOS>
thought
Blaize
,
"
From
his
gloomy
looks
,
and
the
weapon
he
has
taken
with
him
,
I
should
judge
he
is
about
to
murder
some
one
--
perhaps
the
Earl
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
prevented
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
though
perhaps
rather
more
influenced
by
curiosity
than
any
better
feeling
,
the
porter
waited
a
few
seconds
to
allow
the
apprentice
to
get
out
of
sight
,
and
then
locking
the
door
outside
,
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
,
and
followed
him
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
profoundly
dark
,
but
he
had
noticed
the
direction
taken
by
Leonard
,
and
running
noiselessly
along
the
street
,
soon
perceived
him
a
little
in
advance
.
<EOS>
Regulating
his
pace
by
that
of
the
apprentice
,
and
keeping
about
fifty
yards
behind
him
,
he
tracked
his
course
along
several
streets
,
until
he
saw
him
pass
through
the
second
postern
in
the
city
wall
,
near
Moorgate
.
 
<EOS>
Here
he
debated
with
himself
whether
to
proceed
further
or
turn
back
;
but
at
length
,
curiosity
got
the
best
of
his
fears
,
and
he
went
on
.
<EOS>
A
few
steps
brought
him
into
the
open
fields
,
and
fancying
he
saw
Leonard
at
a
little
distance
before
him
,
he
hurried
on
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
But
he
soon
found
he
had
been
deceived
by
the
stump
of
a
tree
,
and
began
to
fear
he
must
have
taken
the
wrong
course
.
<EOS>
He
looked
around
in
vain
for
some
object
to
guide
him
.
<EOS>
The
darkness
was
so
profound
that
he
could
see
nothing
,
and
he
set
off
again
at
random
,
and
not
without
much
self
-
reproach
and
misgiving
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
he
reached
a
hedge
,
and
continued
to
skirt
it
,
until
he
perceived
through
the
bushes
the
light
of
a
lantern
in
the
adjoining
field
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
called
out
,
but
at
the
cry
the
light
disappeared
.
<EOS>
This
did
not
prevent
him
from
making
towards
the
spot
where
he
had
seen
it
;
but
he
had
not
proceeded
far
when
he
was
forcibly
seized
by
some
unseen
person
,
thrown
on
the
ground
,
and
a
drawn
sword
--
for
he
felt
the
point
--
placed
at
his
throat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Utter
a
cry
,
and
it
is
your
last
,
"
cried
a
stern
voice
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
--
who
?
"
demanded
Blaize
,
half
dead
with
terror
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
whom
you
appointed
to
meet
,
"
replied
the
unknown
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
appointed
to
meet
no
one
,
"
rejoined
Blaize
.
 
<EOS>
"
Liar
!
"
exclaimed
the
other
;
"
if
you
do
not
instantly
lead
me
to
him
,
I
will
cut
your
throat
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
lead
you
wherever
you
please
,
if
you
will
only
let
me
get
up
,
"
rejoined
Blaize
,
with
difficulty
repressing
a
cry
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
the
daughters
of
Nox
and
Acheron
!
"
exclaimed
a
voice
which
sounded
like
music
in
the
porter
's
ears
,
"
I
think
you
are
mistaken
in
your
man
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
It
does
not
sound
like
the
apprentice
's
voice
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
_
not
_
the
apprentice
's
voice
,
good
Major
Pillichody
,
"
rejoined
the
porter
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
mine
,
your
friend
--
Blaize
's
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Blaize
!
"
exclaimed
Pillichody
,
unmasking
a
dark
lantern
,
and
revealing
the
terror
-
stricken
countenance
of
the
porter
;
"
so
it
is
.
<EOS>
In
the
devil
's
name
,
what
are
you
doing
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
devil
himself
,
who
put
it
into
my
head
to
come
,
only
knows
,
"
replied
Blaize
;
"
but
I
followed
Leonard
Holt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Which
way
did
he
take
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
person
who
had
assailed
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
exactly
say
,
"
replied
Blaize
,
"
but
he
seemed
to
go
straight
into
the
fields
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
no
doubt
gone
to
the
plague
-
pit
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
now
at
liberty
,
"
he
added
to
Blaize
,
"
and
I
counsel
you
to
make
the
best
of
your
way
home
.
<EOS>
Say
nothing
to
your
master
of
what
has
occurred
.
<EOS>
The
city
walls
lie
in
that
direction
.
"
 
<EOS>
Overjoyed
to
be
released
,
Blaize
ran
off
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
,
and
never
stopped
till
he
reached
Moorgate
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Leonard
had
reached
the
place
of
meeting
.
<EOS>
As
he
stood
by
the
rail
surrounding
the
plague
-
pit
,
he
thought
of
Mr.
Bloundel
's
singular
dream
,
and
almost
hoping
to
be
similarly
favoured
,
flung
himself
on
his
knees
,
and
besought
Amabel
,
if
it
were
possible
,
to
appear
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
his
entreaties
produced
no
result
.
<EOS>
The
chill
blast
whistled
past
him
,
and
,
mindful
of
what
had
been
told
him
,
he
was
fain
to
interpret
this
into
an
answer
to
his
request
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
bitterly
cold
,
and
Leonard
,
whose
limbs
were
almost
stiffened
by
long
kneeling
,
walked
round
and
round
the
enclosure
at
a
quick
pace
to
put
his
blood
into
circulation
.
<EOS>
As
the
hour
of
midnight
was
tolled
forth
by
the
neighbouring
churches
,
he
heard
footsteps
,
and
could
just
detect
a
figure
advancing
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
there
?
"
was
asked
in
the
voice
of
Thirlby
.
<EOS>
Leonard
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
and
the
other
instantly
joined
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
mentioned
our
meeting
to
any
one
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
because
I
was
warned
by
the
Earl
of
Rochester
not
to
attend
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Strange
!
"
exclaimed
Thirlby
,
musingly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
However
,
do
not
let
us
waste
time
.
<EOS>
I
am
about
to
leave
London
,
perhaps
this
country
--
for
ever
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
depart
without
an
interview
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
aware
of
my
strong
attachment
to
my
poor
lost
child
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
Isabella
now
supplies
her
place
in
my
heart
.
<EOS>
She
is
the
only
being
I
love
on
earth
,
for
my
son
has
alienated
himself
from
my
affections
.
<EOS>
All
I
desire
is
to
see
her
happy
.
<EOS>
This
,
I
find
,
can
only
be
accomplished
in
one
way
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
he
paused
for
a
moment
,
but
as
Leonard
made
no
remark
,
he
proceeded
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
hesitate
to
declare
it
,
"
he
said
,
"
since
it
was
for
that
object
I
brought
you
hither
?
<EOS>
She
loves
you
--
devotedly
loves
you
--
and
if
her
wishes
were
opposed
,
I
should
tremble
for
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
Now
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
Situated
as
you
are
,
you
never
can
we
d
her
.
<EOS>
I
will
,
however
,
point
out
a
means
by
which
you
can
raise
yourself
to
distinction
in
a
short
time
,
and
so
entitle
yourself
to
claim
her
hand
.
<EOS>
I
will
supply
you
with
money
--
more
than
you
can
require
--
will
place
you
at
court
--
near
the
king
's
person
--
and
if
you
act
under
my
direction
,
your
rise
is
certain
.
<EOS>
I
have
extorted
a
promise
to
this
effect
from
my
own
son
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
my
object
,
and
that
if
he
did
not
make
your
fortune
,
I
could
ruin
him
by
revealing
myself
.
<EOS>
I
may
,
perhaps
,
pay
the
penalty
of
my
crime
on
the
scaffold
;
but
I
may
also
escape
.
<EOS>
In
the
latter
case
,
my
reappearance
would
be
fatal
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
has
consented
to
cooperate
with
me
,
to
watch
over
your
fortunes
,
and
,
as
soon
as
you
have
attained
sufficient
eminence
,
to
bestow
his
sister
upon
you
.
<EOS>
Now
do
you
understand
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
"
and
I
understand
also
against
whom
the
Earl
of
Rochester
warned
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
consent
,
"
demanded
Thirlby
.
 
<EOS>
Leonard
,
was
about
to
answer
,
when
he
felt
a
light
and
trembling
hand
placed
upon
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
answer
inconsiderately
,
Leonard
,
"
said
a
low
,
sweet
voice
,
which
he
recognised
as
that
of
the
Lady
Isabella
;
"
I
am
here
to
receive
your
determination
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
it
,
"
replied
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
deep
devotion
you
have
displayed
towards
me
deserves
to
be
requited
.
<EOS>
I
will
strive
to
render
myself
worthy
of
you
,
and
I
feel
that
by
so
doing
<EOS>
I
shall
best
fulfil
the
injunctions
of
her
who
lies
beside
us
.
<EOS>
Henceforth
,
Lady
Isabella
,
I
wholly
devote
myself
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
murmur
of
delight
escaped
her
.
<EOS>
"
My
blessings
on
you
both
!
"
exclaimed
her
father
.
"
<EOS>
Give
me
your
hand
,
Isabella
,
"
he
added
,
taking
it
and
placing
it
in
that
of
the
apprentice
.
"
<EOS>
Here
,
beside
the
grave
of
her
whom
you
both
loved
,
I
affiance
you
.
<EOS>
Pursue
the
course
I
point
out
to
you
,
Leonard
,
and
she
will
soon
be
yours
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
the
light
of
a
lantern
was
suddenly
thrown
upon
them
,
disclosing
two
persons
who
had
noiselessly
approached
.
<EOS>
They
were
Lord
Argentine
and
Pillichody
.
<EOS>
"
You
affirm
more
than
you
have
warrant
for
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
former
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
consent
to
this
ill
-
assorted
and
dishonourable
union
;
and
,
so
far
from
permitting
it
,
will
oppose
it
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
.
<EOS>
If
this
presumptuous
apprentice
dares
to
raise
his
views
towards
my
sister
,
let
him
look
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Your
safety
lies
in
instant
flight
.
<EOS>
The
officers
are
in
search
of
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
shall
find
me
,
"
replied
Thirlby
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
you
please
,
"
rejoined
Argentine
.
<EOS>
"
Come
with
me
,
Isabella
,
"
he
added
to
his
sister
.
<EOS>
But
she
flew
with
a
cry
towards
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
her
brother
,
drawing
his
sword
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
dare
to
detain
,
her
?
<EOS>
Deliver
her
to
me
,
villain
,
instantly
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
when
thus
menaced
,
my
lord
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
,
likewise
drawing
his
sword
,
and
standing
upon
the
defensive
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
look
to
yourself
,
"
replied
Argentine
,
assaulting
him
.
 
<EOS>
Isabella
uttered
a
wild
shriek
,
and
Thirlby
tried
to
rush
between
them
.
<EOS>
But
before
they
could
be
separated
,
Lord
Argentine
's
fury
had
exposed
him
to
his
adversary
,
whose
sword
passed
through
his
body
.
<EOS>
He
fell
to
the
ground
,
weltering
in
his
blood
.
<EOS>
While
Leonard
stood
stupefied
and
confounded
at
what
had
occurred
,
and
Isabella
,
uttering
a
loud
cry
,
threw
herself
upon
the
body
and
tried
to
stanch
the
wound
--
two
men
,
with
halberds
in
their
hands
rushed
forward
,
and
seizing
Thirlby
,
cried
,
"
We
arrest
you
as
a
murderer
!
"
 
<EOS>
Thirlby
,
who
seemed
utterly
overcome
by
surprise
and
horror
,
offered
no
Resistance
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
Leonard
felt
his
arm
seized
by
a
bystander
--
he
did
not
know
whom
--
and
scarcely
conscious
of
what
was
taking
place
,
suffered
himself
to
be
dragged
from
the
scene
.

<EOS>
THE
FIRE
-
HALL
.
 
<EOS>
About
nine
o'clock
on
the
night
of
Saturday
,
the
second
of
September
,
1666
-
-and
rather
more
than
nine
months
after
the
incidents
last
related,--three
men
took
their
way
from
Smithfield
to
Islington
.
<EOS>
They
proceeded
at
a
swift
pace
and
in
silence
,
until
,
having
mounted
the
steep
hill
on
which
the
suburb
in
question
is
situated
,
they
halted
at
a
short
distance
from
the
high
walls
surrounding
the
great
water
-
works
formed
by
the
New
-
River
-
head
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
dark
,
but
free
from
cloud
,
in
consequence
of
a
strong
easterly
wind
which
prevailed
at
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
dark
in
London
now
,
"
observed
one
of
the
three
persons
to
his
companions
as
he
cast
his
eye
in
the
direction
of
the
great
city
,
that
lay
buried
in
gloom
beneath
them
;
"
but
there
will
be
light
enough
soon
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
second
dawn
,
and
brighter
than
the
first
,
shall
arise
upon
it
<EOS>
,
"
replied
one
of
his
companions
,
a
tall
,
gaunt
man
,
whose
sole
covering
was
a
sheepskin
,
girded
round
his
loins
.
<EOS>
"
Such
a
flame
shall
be
kindled
within
it
,
as
hath
not
been
seen
since
showers
of
brimstone
and
fire
descended
upon
the
sinful
cities
of
the
plain
.
'
<EOS>
The
Lord
shall
come
with
flames
of
fire
,
'
"
he
added
,
pointing
his
long
staff
towards
the
city
.
"
<EOS>
'
He
shall
make
them
like
a
fiery
oven
,
in
the
time
of
his
wrath
.
<EOS>
They
shall
be
utterly
consumed
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Amen
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
third
person
,
who
stood
near
him
,
in
a
deep
voice
,
and
with
something
of
a
foreign
accent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
loud
,
friends
,
"
rejoined
the
first
speaker
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
set
about
the
task
.
<EOS>
I
will
ascertain
that
no
one
is
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
he
moved
towards
the
water
-
works
,
and
skirting
the
circular
walls
,
to
satisfy
himself
that
all
was
secure
,
he
returned
to
his
companions
,
and
they
proceeded
to
the
principal
entrance
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
Noiselessly
unlocking
the
gates
,
the
leader
of
the
party
admitted
the
others
into
an
open
space
of
some
extent
,
in
the
midst
of
which
was
a
large
reservoir
of
water
.
<EOS>
He
then
gave
each
of
them
a
small
key
,
and
bidding
them
use
despatch
,
they
began
to
turn
the
cocks
of
the
leaden
pipes
connected
with
the
reservoir
,
while
he
hastened
to
the
further
end
of
the
inclosure
,
and
employed
himself
in
a
similar
manner
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
and
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
the
whole
of
the
cocks
were
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
give
me
the
keys
,
"
said
the
leader
.
 
<EOS>
Taking
them
as
they
were
offered
,
he
added
his
own
to
the
number
,
and
flung
them
as
far
as
he
could
into
the
reservoir
,
laughing
slightly
as
the
noise
of
the
splash
occasioned
by
their
fall
into
the
water
reached
the
ears
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
will
not
be
found
till
this
pool
is
drained
,
"
he
observed
to
his
companions
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
let
us
go
.
<EOS>
Our
business
here
is
done
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
yet
a
moment
,
"
cried
Solomon
Eagle
,
who
was
standing
at
the
brink
of
the
reservoir
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
arresting
him
.
"
<EOS>
A
vision
rises
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
see
in
this
watery
mirror
a
representation
of
the
burning
city
.
<EOS>
And
what
are
those
fearful
forms
that
feed
the
flames
?
<EOS>
Fiends
,
in
our
likeness
--
fiends
!
<EOS>
And
see
how
wide
and
far
the
conflagration
spreads
.
<EOS>
The
whole
city
is
swallowed
up
by
an
earthquake
.
<EOS>
It
sinks
to
the
bottomless
pit
--
down
--
down
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
more
of
this
,
"
cried
the
leader
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
Come
along
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
followed
by
the
others
,
he
rushed
to
the
gates
,
and
locking
them
after
him
,
flung
the
key
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
hundred
pounds
were
paid
to
the
servant
of
the
chief
officer
of
the
works
to
bring
those
keys
to
me
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
he
executed
his
commission
faithfully
and
well
.
<EOS>
Water
will
be
vainly
sought
for
to
quench
the
conflagration
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
like
not
the
vision
I
have
just
beheld
,
"
said
Solomon
Eagle
,
in
a
troubled
tone
.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
portend
mischief
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Think
of
it
no
more
,
"
rejoined
the
leader
,
"
or
regard
it
as
it
was
--
a
phantom
created
by
your
overheated
imagination
.
<EOS>
Yon
city
has
sinned
so
deeply
,
that
it
is
the
will
of
Heaven
it
should
be
destroyed
;
and
it
has
been
put
into
our
hearts
by
the
Supreme
Power
to
undertake
the
terrible
task
.
<EOS>
We
are
the
chosen
instruments
of
the
divine
displeasure
.
<EOS>
Everything
favours
the
design
--
the
long
-
continued
dry
weather
--
the
strong
easterly
wind
,
which
will
bear
the
flames
into
the
heart
of
the
city
--
the
want
of
water
,
occasioned
by
the
stopping
of
these
pipes
,
the
emptying
of
the
various
aqueducts
,
and
the
destruction
of
the
Thames
water
-
tower
,
which
we
have
accomplished
.
<EOS>
Everything
favours
it
,
I
say
,
and
proves
that
the
hand
of
Heaven
directs
us
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
London
shall
fall
!
<EOS>
We
have
received
our
commission
from
on
high
,
and
must
execute
it
,
regardless
of
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
feel
as
little
compunction
to
the
task
,
as
the
thunderbolt
launched
from
on
high
does
for
the
tree
it
shivers
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Philip
Grant
has
uttered
my
sentiments
exactly
,
"
said
the
man
who
,
it
has
been
mentioned
,
spoke
with
a
slight
foreign
accent
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
neither
misgiving
nor
compunction
.
<EOS>
You
appear
to
have
forgotten
your
own
denunciations
,
brother
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
,
Brother
Hubert
,
"
rejoined
the
enthusiast
,
"
and
I
now
recognise
in
the
vision
a
delusion
of
the
Evil
One
to
turn
me
from
my
holy
purpose
.
<EOS>
But
it
has
failed
.
<EOS>
The
impious
and
impenitent
city
is
doomed
,
and
nothing
can
save
it
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
would
fain
see
it
once
more
as
I
beheld
it
this
morn
when
day
arose
upon
it
for
the
last
time
,
from
the
summit
of
Saint
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
It
looked
so
beautiful
that
my
heart
smote
me
,
and
tears
started
to
my
eyes
,
to
think
that
those
goodly
habitations
,
those
towers
,
temples
,
halls
,
and
palaces
,
should
so
soon
be
levelled
with
the
dust
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
what
the
prophet
saith
,
"
rejoined
Hubert
.
"
<EOS>
'
Thou
hast
defiled
thy
sanctuaries
by
the
multitude
of
thine
iniquities
,
by
the
iniquity
of
thy
traffic
.
<EOS>
Therefore
will
I
bring
forth
a
fire
from
the
midst
of
thee
,
and
will
bring
thee
to
ashes
upon
the
earth
,
in
the
sight
of
all
those
that
behold
thee
.
'
"
 
<EOS>
Solomon
Eagle
flung
himself
upon
his
knees
,
and
his
example
was
imitated
by
the
others
.
<EOS>
Having
recited
a
prayer
in
a
low
deep
tone
,
he
arose
,
and
stretching
out
his
arms
,
solemnly
denounced
the
city
.
<EOS>
As
he
pronounced
the
words
,
a
red
and
fiery
star
shot
from
the
dark
vault
of
the
sky
,
and
seemed
to
fall
in
the
midst
of
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
not
see
that
sign
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Grant
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
It
heralds
us
to
our
task
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
ran
swiftly
down
the
hill
,
and
,
followed
by
the
others
,
did
not
slacken
his
pace
till
they
reached
the
city
.
<EOS>
They
then
shaped
their
course
more
slowly
towards
Saint
Paul
's
,
and
having
gained
the
precincts
of
the
cathedral
,
Solomon
Eagle
,
who
now
assumed
the
place
of
leader
,
conducted
them
to
a
small
door
on
the
left
of
the
great
northern
entrance
,
and
unlocking
it
,
ushered
them
into
a
narrow
passage
behind
the
rich
carved
work
of
the
choir
.
<EOS>
Traversing
it
,
they
crossed
the
mid
aisle
,
and
soon
reached
the
steps
leading
to
Saint
Faith
's
.
<EOS>
It
was
profoundly
dark
,
but
they
were
all
well
acquainted
with
the
road
,
and
did
not
miss
their
footing
.
<EOS>
It
required
,
however
,
some
caution
to
thread
the
ranks
of
the
mighty
pillars
filling
the
subterranean
church
.
<EOS>
But
at
last
this
was
accomplished
,
and
they
entered
the
vault
beyond
the
charnel
,
where
they
found
Chowles
and
Judith
Malmayns
.
<EOS>
The
former
was
wrapped
in
a
long
black
cloak
,
and
was
pacing
to
and
fro
within
the
narrow
chamber
.
<EOS>
When
Solomon
Eagle
appeared
,
he
sprang
towards
him
,
and
regarding
him
inquiringly
,
cried
,
"
Have
you
done
it?--have
<EOS>
you
done
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
enthusiast
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"
Heaven
be
praised
!
"
exclaimed
Chowles
.
<EOS>
And
he
skipped
about
with
the
wildest
expressions
of
delight
.
<EOS>
A
gleam
of
satisfaction
,
too
,
darted
from
Judith
's
savage
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
had
neither
risen
nor
altered
her
position
on
the
arrival
of
the
party
,
but
she
now
got
up
,
and
addressed
the
enthusiast
.
<EOS>
A
small
iron
lamp
,
suspended
by
a
chain
from
the
vaulted
roof
,
lighted
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
The
most
noticeable
figure
amidst
the
group
was
that
of
Solomon
Eagle
,
who
,
with
his
blazing
eyes
,
long
jet
-
black
locks
,
giant
frame
,
and
tawny
skin
,
looked
like
a
supernatural
being
.
<EOS>
Near
him
stood
the
person
designated
as
Robert
Hubert
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
young
man
,
and
appeared
to
have
lived
a
life
of
great
austerity
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
thin
;
his
large
black
eyes
set
in
deep
caverns
;
his
limbs
seemed
almost
destitute
of
flesh
;
and
his
looks
wild
and
uncertain
,
like
those
of
an
insane
person
.
<EOS>
His
tattered
and
threadbare
garb
resembled
that
of
a
French
ecclesiastic
.
<EOS>
The
third
person
,
who
went
by
the
name
of
Philip
Grant
,
had
a
powerful
frame
,
though
somewhat
bent
,
and
a
haughty
deportment
and
look
,
greatly
at
variance
with
his
miserable
attire
and
haggard
looks
.
<EOS>
His
beard
was
long
and
grizzled
,
and
his
features
,
though
sharpened
by
care
,
retained
some
traces
of
a
noble
expression
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
having
passed
in
conversation
,
Grant
observed
to
the
enthusiast
,
"
I
must
now
leave
you
for
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
Give
me
the
key
that
I
may
let
myself
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
going
to
betray
us
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Chowles
,
suspiciously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
betray
you
?
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Grant
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
too
anxious
for
the
event
to
disclose
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
true
,
"
replied
Chowles
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
I
_
do
not
mistrust
you
,
brother
,
"
observed
Solomon
Eagle
,
giving
him
the
key
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
whither
you
are
going
,
"
observed
Judith
Malmayns
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
about
to
warn
Mr.
Bloundel
and
his
partner
--
apprentice
no
longer
--
Leonard
Holt
,
of
the
approaching
conflagration
.
<EOS>
But
your
care
will
be
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Does
she
speak
the
truth
,
brother
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Hubert
,
raising
his
eyes
from
the
Bible
which
he
was
reading
in
the
corner
of
the
vault
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
nothing
to
endanger
the
design
,
"
rejoined
Grant
;
"
of
that
rest
assured
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
strode
forth
,
traversed
Saint
Faith
's
,
and
,
notwithstanding
the
gloom
,
reached
,
without
difficulty
,
the
little
door
by
which
he
had
entered
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
Issuing
from
it
,
he
took
the
way
,
as
Judith
had
surmised
,
to
Wood
-
street
,
and
pausing
before
the
grocer
's
door
,
knocked
against
it
.
<EOS>
The
summons
was
presently
answered
by
Blaize
;
and
to
Grant
's
inquiries
whether
his
master
was
within
,
he
replied
,
"
Which
of
my
masters
did
you
mean
?
<EOS>
I
have
two
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
younger
,
"
replied
Grant
,
"
Leonard
Holt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
far
you
are
fortunate
,
"
rejoined
Blaize
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
has
retired
to
rest
,
but
Mr.
Holt
is
still
downstairs
.
<EOS>
Pray
what
may
be
your
business
with
him
at
this
hour
?
<EOS>
It
should
be
important
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
important
,
"
rejoined
Grant
,
"
and
does
not
admit
of
a
moment
's
delay
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
Eyeing
the
stranger
with
a
look
of
suspicion
,
the
porter
was
about
to
enter
into
a
parley
with
him
,
when
Leonard
himself
cut
it
short
,
and
learning
the
nature
of
the
application
,
desired
Grant
to
follow
him
into
the
adjoining
room
.
<EOS>
The
nine
months
which
had
passed
over
Leonard
's
head
since
he
was
last
brought
under
notice
,
had
wrought
a
material
change
in
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
grave
and
thoughtful
air
,
somewhat
inclining
to
melancholy
,
but
in
other
respects
he
was
greatly
improved
.
<EOS>
His
health
was
completely
restored
,
and
the
thoughtful
expression
added
character
to
his
handsome
physiognomy
,
and
harmonised
well
with
his
manly
and
determined
bearing
.
<EOS>
He
was
habited
plainly
,
but
with
some
degree
of
taste
.
<EOS>
As
Judith
Malmayns
had
intimated
,
he
was
now
Mr.
Bloundel
's
partner
,
and
his
whole
appearance
denoted
his
improved
circumstances
.
<EOS>
The
alteration
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
the
stranger
,
who
regarded
him
with
much
curiosity
,
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
as
he
entered
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
looking
much
better
than
when
we
last
met
,
Leonard
Holt
,
"
he
said
,
in
tones
that
made
his
hearer
start
,
"
and
I
am
glad
to
perceive
it
.
<EOS>
Prosperity
seems
to
attend
your
path
,
and
you
deserve
it
;
whereas
misery
and
every
other
ill
--
and
I
deserve
them
--
dog
mine
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
recognise
you
at
first
,
Mr.
Thirlby
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
"
for
,
in
truth
,
you
are
much
changed
.
<EOS>
But
you
desire
to
speak
with
me
on
a
matter
of
importance
.
<EOS>
Can
I
aid
you
?
<EOS>
You
may
need
money
.
<EOS>
Here
is
my
purse
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
it
,
"
replied
the
other
,
scornfully
rejecting
the
offer
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
proposal
to
make
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
But
first
tell
me
how
you
effected
your
escape
after
your
arrest
on
that
disastrous
night
when
,
in
self
-
defence
,
and
unintentionally
,
I
wounded
your
son
,
Lord
Argentine
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Would
you
had
killed
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
other
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
lost
all
feelings
of
a
father
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
<EOS>
it
was
who
contrived
my
arrest
,
and
he
would
have
gladly
seen
me
borne
to
the
scaffold
,
certain
it
would
have
freed
him
from
me
for
ever
.
<EOS>
I
was
hurried
away
by
the
officers
from
the
scene
of
strife
,
and
conveyed
to
the
Tun
at
Cornhill
,
which
you
know
has
been
converted
into
a
round
-
house
,
and
where
I
was
locked
up
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
But
while
I
was
lying
on
the
floor
of
my
prison
,
driven
well
-
nigh
frantic
by
what
had
occurred
,
there
were
two
persons
without
labouring
to
effect
my
deliverance
--
nor
did
they
labour
in
vain
.
<EOS>
These
were
Chowles
and
Judith
,
my
foster
-
sister
,
and
whom
,
you
may
remember
,
I
suspected
--
and
most
unfairly
--
of
intending
my
betrayal
.
<EOS>
By
means
of
a
heavy
bribe
,
they
prevailed
on
one
of
the
officers
to
connive
at
my
escape
.
<EOS>
An
iron
bar
was
removed
from
the
window
of
my
prison
,
and
I
got
through
the
aperture
.
<EOS>
Judith
concealed
me
for
some
days
in
the
vaults
of
Saint
Faith
's
,
after
which
I
fled
into
the
country
,
where
I
wandered
about
for
several
months
,
under
the
name
of
Philip
Grant
.
<EOS>
Having
learnt
that
my
son
though
severely
hurt
by
you
,
had
recovered
from
his
wound
,
and
that
his
sister
,
the
Lady
Isabella
,
had
accompanied
him
to
his
seat
in
Staffordshire
,
I
proceeded
thither
,
and
saw
her
,
unknown
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
found
her
heart
still
true
to
you
.
<EOS>
She
told
me
you
had
disappeared
immediately
after
the
termination
of
the
conflict
,
and
had
not
been
heard
of
till
her
brother
was
out
of
danger
,
when
you
returned
to
Wood
-
street
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
information
was
correct
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
dragged
away
by
a
person
whom
I
did
not
recognise
at
the
time
,
but
who
proved
to
be
the
Earl
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
He
conducted
me
to
a
place
of
safety
,
thrust
a
purse
into
my
hand
,
and
left
me
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
could
do
so
with
safety
,
I
returned
to
my
master
's
house
.
<EOS>
But
how
long
have
you
been
in
London
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nearly
a
month
,
"
replied
Grant
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
let
me
ask
you
one
question
.
<EOS>
Do
you
ever
think
of
Isabella
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Often
,
very
often
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
But
as
I
dare
not
indulge
the
hope
of
a
union
with
her
,
I
have
striven
to
banish
her
image
from
my
mind
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
can
not
forget
_
<EOS>
you
_
,
Leonard
,
"
rejoined
Grant
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
to
my
proposal
.
<EOS>
I
have
another
plan
for
your
aggrandisement
that
can
not
fail
.
<EOS>
I
am
in
possession
of
a
monstrous
design
,
the
revelation
of
which
will
procure
you
whatever
you
desire
.
<EOS>
Ask
a
title
from
the
king
,
and
he
will
give
it
;
and
when
in
possession
of
that
title
,
demand
the
hand
of
the
Lady
Isabella
,
and
her
proud
brother
will
not
refuse
you
.
<EOS>
Call
in
your
porter
--
seize
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
offer
a
feigned
resistance
.
<EOS>
Convey
me
before
the
king
.
<EOS>
Make
your
own
terms
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
will
accede
to
them
.
<EOS>
Will
you
do
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
"
I
will
not
purchase
the
daughter
at
the
price
of
the
father
's
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heed
me
not
,
"
replied
Grant
,
supplicatingly
,
"
I
am
wholly
indifferent
to
life
.
<EOS>
And
what
matters
it
whether
I
am
dragged
to
the
scaffold
for
one
crime
or
another
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
plead
in
vain
,
"
returned
Leonard
,
firmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Reflect
,
"
cried
Grant
,
in
an
agonised
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
word
from
you
will
not
only
win
you
Isabella
,
but
save
the
city
from
destruction
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Save
the
city
!
"
exclaimed
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
mean
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Swear
to
comply
with
my
request
,
and
you
shall
know
.
<EOS>
But
not
otherwise
,
"
replied
Grant
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
cannot
--
I
can
not
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
;
"
and
unfortunately
you
have
said
too
much
for
your
own
safety
.
<EOS>
I
must
,
though
most
reluctantly
,
detain
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
,
Leonard
,
and
consider
well
what
you
do
,
"
cried
Grant
,
planting
himself
before
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
I
love
you
next
to
my
daughter
,
and
chiefly
because
she
loves
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
I
have
a
design
to
discover
,
to
which
I
am
a
party
--
a
hellish
,
horrible
design
--
which
threatens
this
whole
city
with
destruction
.
<EOS>
It
is
your
duty
,
having
told
you
thus
much
,
to
arrest
me
,
and
I
will
offer
no
resistance
.
<EOS>
Will
you
not
turn
this
to
your
advantage
?
<EOS>
Will
you
not
make
a
bargain
with
the
king
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
I
will
not
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
be
warned
by
me
,
"
rejoined
Grant
.
"
<EOS>
Arouse
your
partner
.
<EOS>
Pack
up
all
your
goods
and
make
preparations
for
instant
flight
,
for
the
danger
will
invade
you
before
you
are
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
fire
?
"
demanded
Leonard
,
upon
whose
mind
the
denunciations
of
Solomon
Eagle
now
rushed
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
,
"
replied
Grant
,
with
a
terrible
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
repent
your
determination
when
it
is
too
late
.
<EOS>
Farewell
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Leonard
,
advancing
towards
him
,
and
trying
to
lay
hands
upon
him
<EOS>
,
"
I
arrest
you
in
the
king
's
name
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Off
!
"
exclaimed
Grant
,
dashing
him
forcibly
backwards
.
<EOS>
And
striking
down
Blaize
,
who
tried
to
stop
him
in
the
passage
,
he
threw
open
the
street
-
door
,
and
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Fearful
of
pursuit
,
Grant
took
a
circuitous
route
to
Saint
Paul
's
,
and
it
was
full
half
an
hour
after
the
interview
above
related
before
he
reached
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
passed
through
the
small
door
,
the
clock
tolled
forth
the
hour
of
midnight
,
and
when
he
gained
the
mid
aisle
,
he
heard
footsteps
approaching
,
and
encountered
his
friends
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
had
given
you
up
,
"
said
Chowles
,
"
and
fearing
you
intended
us
some
treachery
,
were
about
to
do
the
job
without
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
unavoidably
detained
,
"
replied
Grant
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
about
it
at
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
got
the
fire
-
balls
with
me
,
"
observed
Hubert
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
well
,
"
returned
Grant
.
 
<EOS>
Quitting
the
cathedral
,
they
proceeded
to
Thames
-
street
,
and
tracking
it
to
Fish
-
street
-
hill
,
struck
off
on
the
right
into
an
alley
that
brought
them
to
Pudding
-
lane
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
house
,
"
said
Chowles
,
halting
before
a
two
-
storied
wooden
habitation
,
over
the
door
of
which
was
suspended
the
sign
of
the
"
Wheat
Sheaf
,
with
the
name
THOMAS
FARRYNER
,
BAKER
,
inscribed
beneath
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
here
,
"
said
Hubert
,
"
shall
begin
the
great
fire
of
London
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
,
he
gave
a
fire
-
ball
to
Solomon
Eagle
,
who
lighted
the
fuze
at
Chowles
's
lantern
.
<EOS>
The
enthusiast
then
approached
a
window
of
the
baker
's
shop
,
and
breaking
a
small
pane
of
glass
within
it
,
threw
the
fire
-
ball
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
alighted
upon
a
heap
of
chips
and
fagots
lying
near
a
large
stack
of
wood
used
for
the
oven
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
whole
pile
had
caught
and
burst
into
a
flame
,
which
,
quickly
mounting
to
the
ceiling
,
set
fire
to
the
old
,
dry
,
half
-
decayed
timber
that
composed
it
.
  
<EOS>
II
.
 
<EOS>
THE
FIRST
NIGHT
OF
THE
FIRE
.
 
<EOS>
Having
seen
the
stack
of
wood
kindled
,
and
the
flames
attack
the
building
in
such
a
manner
as
to
leave
no
doubt
they
would
destroy
it
,
the
incendiaries
separated
,
previously
agreeing
to
meet
together
in
half
an
hour
at
the
foot
of
London
Bridge
;
and
while
the
others
started
off
in
different
directions
,
Chowles
and
Judith
retreated
to
a
neighbouring
alley
commanding
a
view
of
the
burning
habitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
last
the
great
design
is
executed
,
"
observed
Chowles
,
rubbing
his
hands
gleefully
.
"
<EOS>
The
fire
burns
right
merrily
,
and
will
not
soon
be
extinguished
.
<EOS>
Who
would
have
thought
we
should
have
found
such
famous
assistants
as
the
two
madmen
,
Solomon
Eagle
and
Robert
Hubert
--
and
your
scarcely
less
mad
foster
-
brother
,
Philip
Grant
?
<EOS>
I
can
understand
the
motives
that
influenced
the
two
first
to
the
deed
,
but
not
those
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
I
,
"
replied
Judith
,
"
unless
he
wishes
in
some
way
or
other
to
benefit
Leonard
Holt
by
it
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
shall
enjoy
this
fire
quite
as
much
on
its
own
account
as
for
the
plunder
it
will
bring
us
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
every
house
in
this
great
city
destroyed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
a
fair
way
of
obtaining
your
wish
,
"
replied
Chowles
;
"
but
provided
I
have
the
sacking
of
them
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
care
how
many
are
saved
.
<EOS>
Not
but
that
such
a
fire
will
be
a
grand
sight
,
which
I
should
be
sorry
to
miss
.
<EOS>
You
forget
,
too
,
that
if
Saint
Paul
's
should
be
burnt
down
,
we
shall
lose
our
hoards
.
<EOS>
However
,
there
's
no
chance
of
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
much
,
"
replied
Judith
,
interrupting
him
.
"
<EOS>
But
see
!
<EOS>
the
baker
has
at
last
discovered
that
his
dwelling
is
on
fire
.
<EOS>
He
bursts
open
the
window
,
and
,
as
I
live
,
is
about
to
throw
himself
out
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
,
one
of
the
upper
windows
in
the
burning
habitation
was
burst
open
,
and
a
poor
terrified
wretch
appeared
at
it
in
his
night
-
dress
,
vociferating
in
tones
of
the
wildest
alarm
,
"
Fire
!
<EOS>
fire!--help
!
<EOS>
help
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
go
forward
?
"
said
Chowles
.
<EOS>
Judith
hesitated
for
a
moment
,
and
then
assenting
,
they
hurried
towards
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
we
give
you
any
help
,
friend
?
"
cried
Chowles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
care
of
this
,
"
rejoined
the
baker
,
flinging
a
bag
of
money
to
the
ground
,
"
and
I
will
endeavour
to
let
down
my
wife
and
children
.
<EOS>
The
staircase
is
on
fire
,
and
we
are
almost
stifled
with
smoke
.
<EOS>
God
help
us
!
"
<EOS>
And
the
exclamation
was
followed
by
fearful
shrieks
from
within
,
followed
by
the
appearance
of
a
woman
,
holding
two
little
children
in
her
arms
,
at
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
must
be
money
,
"
said
Judith
,
utterly
heedless
of
the
fearful
scene
occurring
above
,
and
taking
up
the
bag
and
chinking
it
;
"
silver
,
by
the
sound
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
make
off
with
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
replied
Chowles
,
"
we
must
not
run
any
risk
for
such
a
paltry
booty
.
<EOS>
Let
us
bide
our
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
the
baker
,
who
had
disappeared
for
a
few
seconds
from
the
window
,
again
presented
himself
at
it
,
and
,
with
some
difficulty
,
forced
a
feather
bed
through
it
,
which
was
instantly
placed
by
Chowles
in
such
a
position
beneath
,
as
to
break
the
fall
of
the
descending
parties
.
<EOS>
Tying
a
couple
of
sheets
together
,
and
fastening
one
end
round
his
wife
's
waist
,
the
baker
lowered
her
and
the
children
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
They
alighted
in
safety
;
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
follow
their
example
,
the
floor
of
the
room
gave
way
,
and
though
he
succeeded
in
springing
through
the
window
,
he
missed
the
feather
bed
,
and
broke
his
leg
in
the
fall
.
<EOS>
He
was
picked
up
by
Chowles
and
Judith
,
and
placed
upon
the
bed
in
a
state
of
insensibility
,
and
was
soon
afterwards
conveyed
with
his
family
to
the
house
of
a
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
fire
had
spread
to
the
houses
on
either
side
of
the
unfortunate
man
's
habitation
,
and
both
of
them
being
built
entirely
of
wood
,
they
were
almost
instantly
in
flames
.
<EOS>
The
alarm
too
had
become
general
;
the
inhabitants
of
the
adjoining
houses
were
filled
with
indescribable
terror
,
and
the
narrow
street
was
speedily
crowded
with
persons
of
both
sexes
,
who
had
rushed
from
their
beds
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
danger
.
<EOS>
All
was
terror
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
The
fire
-
bells
of
Saint
Margaret
's
,
Saint
George
's
,
and
Saint
Andrew
's
,
in
Botolph
-
lane
,
began
to
toll
,
and
shouts
were
heard
on
every
side
,
proving
that
the
whole
neighbourhood
was
roused
.
 
<EOS>
To
add
to
the
general
distress
,
a
report
was
raised
that
a
house
in
Fish
-
street
-
hill
was
on
fire
,
and
it
was
soon
found
to
be
true
,
as
an
immense
volume
of
flames
burst
forth
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
While
the
rest
of
the
spectators
,
distracted
by
this
calamity
,
and
hardly
knowing
what
to
do
,
hurried
in
the
direction
of
the
new
fire
,
Chowles
and
Judith
eyed
each
other
askance
,
and
the
former
whispered
to
his
companion
,
"
This
is
another
piece
of
Hubert
's
handiwork
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
two
wretches
now
thought
it
time
to
bestir
themselves
.
<EOS>
So
much
confusion
prevailed
,
that
they
were
wholly
unobserved
,
and
under
the
plea
of
rendering
assistance
,
they
entered
houses
and
carried
off
whatever
excited
their
cupidity
,
or
was
sufficiently
portable
.
<EOS>
No
wealthy
house
had
been
attacked
as
yet
,
and
therefore
their
spoil
was
but
trifling
.
<EOS>
The
poor
baker
seemed
to
be
the
bearer
of
ill
-
luck
,
for
he
had
not
been
many
minutes
in
his
new
asylum
before
it
likewise
caught
fire
.
<EOS>
Another
house
,
too
,
in
Fish
-
street
-
hill
,
and
lower
down
than
the
first
,
was
observed
to
be
burning
,
and
as
this
was
out
of
the
current
of
the
wind
,
and
consequently
could
not
have
been
occasioned
by
the
showers
of
sparks
that
marked
its
course
,
a
cry
was
instantly
raised
that
incendiaries
were
abroad
,
and
several
suspicious
-
looking
persons
were
seized
in
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
Meantime
no
efforts
had
been
made
to
stop
the
progress
of
the
original
conflagration
in
Pudding
-
lane
,
which
continued
to
rage
with
the
greatest
fury
,
spreading
from
house
to
house
with
astonishing
rapidity
.
<EOS>
All
the
buildings
in
this
neighbourhood
being
old
,
and
of
wood
,
which
was
as
dry
as
tinder
,
a
spark
alighting
upon
them
would
have
sufficed
to
set
them
on
fire
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
conceived
,
therefore
,
what
must
have
been
the
effect
of
a
vast
volume
of
flame
,
fanned
by
a
powerful
wind
.
<EOS>
House
after
house
caught
,
as
if
constructed
of
touchwood
,
and
the
fire
roared
and
raged
to
such
a
degree
,
that
those
who
stood
by
were
too
much
terrified
to
render
any
effectual
assistance
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
sole
thought
that
now
seemed
to
influence
all
<EOS>
was
the
preservation
of
a
portion
of
their
property
.
<EOS>
No
one
regarded
his
neighbour
,
or
the
safety
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
The
narrow
street
was
instantly
filled
with
goods
and
furniture
of
all
kinds
,
thrown
out
of
the
windows
or
pushed
out
of
the
doors
;
but
such
was
the
fierceness
of
the
fire
,
and
the
extraordinary
rapidity
with
which
it
advanced
,
that
the
very
articles
attempted
to
be
saved
were
seized
by
it
,
and
thus
formed
a
means
of
conveying
it
to
the
opposite
houses
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
way
a
number
of
persons
were
inclosed
for
a
short
time
between
two
fires
,
and
seemed
in
imminent
danger
of
being
burned
to
death
.
<EOS>
The
perilous
nature
of
their
situation
was
,
moreover
,
increased
by
a
sudden
and
violent
gust
of
wind
,
which
,
blowing
the
flames
right
across
the
street
,
seemed
to
envelop
all
within
them
.
<EOS>
The
shrieks
that
burst
from
the
poor
creatures
thus
involved
were
most
appalling
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
they
sustained
no
greater
damage
than
was
occasioned
by
the
fright
and
a
slight
scorching
,
for
the
next
moment
the
wind
shifted
,
and
,
sweeping
back
the
flames
,
they
were
enabled
to
effect
their
retreat
.
<EOS>
Chowles
and
Judith
were
among
the
sufferers
,
and
in
the
alarm
of
the
moment
lost
all
the
booty
they
had
obtained
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
the
whole
street
was
on
fire
.
<EOS>
All
idea
of
preserving
their
property
was
therefore
abandoned
by
the
inhabitants
,
and
they
thought
only
of
saving
themselves
.
<EOS>
Hundreds
of
half
-
naked
persons
of
both
sexes
rushed
towards
Thames
-
street
in
search
of
a
place
of
refuge
.
<EOS>
The
scene
was
wholly
without
parallel
for
terror
.
<EOS>
Many
fires
had
occurred
in
London
,
but
none
that
raged
with
such
fierceness
as
the
present
conflagration
,
or
promised
to
be
so
generally
destructive
.
<EOS>
It
gathered
strength
and
fury
each
moment
,
now
rising
high
into
the
air
in
a
towering
sheet
of
flame
,
now
shooting
forward
like
an
enormous
dragon
vomiting
streams
of
fire
upon
its
foes
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
the
flames
changed
colour
,
and
were
partially
obscured
by
a
thick
black
smoke
.
<EOS>
A
large
warehouse
filled
with
resin
,
tar
,
and
other
combustible
matters
,
had
caught
fire
,
and
the
dense
vapour
proceeded
from
the
burning
pitch
.
<EOS>
But
it
cleared
off
in
a
few
minutes
,
and
the
flames
burnt
more
brightly
and
fiercely
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
Up
to
this
time
,
none
of
the
civic
authorities
having
arrived
,
several
persons
set
off
to
give
information
of
the
calamity
to
the
lord
mayor
(
Sir
Thomas
Bludworth
)
,
and
the
other
magistrates
.
<EOS>
A
small
party
of
the
watch
were
on
the
spot
,
but
they
were
unable
to
render
any
effectual
assistance
.
<EOS>
As
the
conflagration
advanced
,
those
occupying
houses
in
its
track
quitted
them
,
and
left
their
goods
a
prey
to
the
numerous
plunderers
,
who
were
now
gathered
together
pursuing
their
vocation
like
unhallowed
beings
amid
the
raging
element
.
<EOS>
The
whole
presented
a
scene
of
the
wildest
alarm
,
confusion
,
and
license
.
<EOS>
Vociferations
,
oaths
,
shrieks
,
and
outcries
of
every
description
stunned
the
ear
.
<EOS>
Night
was
turned
into
day
.
<EOS>
The
awful
roaring
of
the
flames
was
ever
and
anon
broken
by
the
thundering
fall
of
some
heavy
roof
.
<EOS>
Flakes
of
fire
were
scattered
far
and
wide
by
the
driving
wind
,
carrying
destruction
wherever
they
alighted
,
and
spreading
the
conflagration
on
all
sides
,
till
it
seemed
like
a
vast
wedge
of
fire
driven
into
the
heart
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
And
thus
it
went
on
,
swallowing
up
all
before
it
,
like
an
insatiate
monster
,
and
roaring
for
very
joy
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
incendiaries
had
met
,
as
concerted
,
near
the
foot
of
the
bridge
,
and
all
except
Philip
Grant
seemed
to
rejoice
in
the
progress
of
the
conflagration
.
<EOS>
Chowles
made
some
comment
upon
his
moody
looks
and
silence
,
and
whispered
in
his
ear
,
<EOS>
"
You
have
now
an
opportunity
of
retrieving
your
fortune
,
and
may
make
yourself
richer
than
your
son
.
<EOS>
Take
my
advice
,
and
do
not
let
it
pass
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Away
,
tempter
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Grant--"I
have
lighted
a
fire
within
my
breast
which
never
will
be
quenched
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poh
,
poh
!
"
rejoined
Judith
;
"
do
not
turn
faint
-
hearted
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
fire
rages
fiercely
,
"
cried
Solomon
Eagle
,
gazing
at
the
vast
sheet
of
flame
overtopping
the
buildings
near
them
,
"
but
we
must
keep
it
alive
.
<EOS>
Take
the
remainder
of
the
fire
-
balls
,
Hubert
,
and
cast
them
into
some
of
the
old
houses
in
Crooked
-
lane
.
"
 
<EOS>
Hubert
prepared
to
obey
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
with
you
,
and
point
out
the
best
spots
,
"
said
Chowles
.
<EOS>
"
Our
next
place
of
rendezvous
must
be
the
vaults
beneath
Saint
Faith
's
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Agreed
!
"
exclaimed
the
others
.
<EOS>
And
they
again
separated
,
Hubert
and
Chowles
to
kindle
fresh
fires
,
and
Grant
to
watch
the
conflagration
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
As
to
Solomon
Eagle
,
he
rushed
towards
the
scene
of
destruction
,
and
forcing
himself
into
the
midst
of
the
crowd
,
mounted
a
post
,
crying
in
a
loud
voice
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
a
second
judgment
would
come
upon
you
on
account
of
your
iniquities
,
and
you
now
find
that
I
avouched
the
truth
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
himself
hath
come
to
preach
to
you
,
as
he
did
in
the
fiery
mount
of
Sinai
,
and
a
terrible
exhortation
it
shall
be
,
and
one
ye
shall
not
easily
forget
.
<EOS>
This
fire
shall
not
be
quenched
till
the
whole
city
is
laid
prostrate
.
<EOS>
Ye
doubted
my
words
when
I
told
you
of
the
plague
;
ye
laughed
at
me
and
scoffed
me
;
but
ye
became
believers
in
the
end
,
and
now
conviction
is
forced
upon
you
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
You
will
vainly
attempt
to
save
your
dwellings
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
Lord
's
will
they
should
be
destroyed
,
and
man
's
efforts
to
avert
the
judgment
will
be
ineffectual
!
"
 
<EOS>
While
the
majority
listened
to
him
with
fear
and
trembling
,
and
regarded
him
as
a
prophet
,
a
few
took
the
opposite
view
of
the
question
,
and
coupling
his
appearance
with
the
sudden
outbreak
of
the
fire
,
were
disposed
to
regard
him
as
an
incendiary
.
<EOS>
They
therefore
cried
out--"He
has
set
fire
to
our
houses
.
<EOS>
Down
with
him
!
<EOS>
down
with
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
Other
voices
joined
in
the
outcry
,
and
an
attempt
was
made
to
carry
the
menace
into
effect
;
but
a
strong
party
rallied
round
the
enthusiast
,
who
derided
the
attempts
of
his
opponents
.
<EOS>
Planting
himself
on
the
steps
of
Saint
Margaret
's
Church
,
he
continued
to
pour
forth
exhortations
to
the
crowd
,
until
he
was
driven
into
the
interior
of
the
pile
by
the
fast
-
approaching
flames
.
<EOS>
The
whole
body
of
the
church
was
filled
with
poor
wretches
who
had
sought
refuge
within
it
,
having
brought
with
them
such
of
their
goods
as
they
were
able
to
carry
off
.
<EOS>
But
it
soon
became
evident
that
the
sacred
structure
would
be
destroyed
,
and
their
screams
and
cries
on
quitting
it
were
truly
heartrending
.
<EOS>
Solomon
Eagle
was
the
last
to
go
forth
,
and
he
delayed
his
departure
till
the
flames
burst
through
the
windows
.
<EOS>
Another
great
storehouse
of
oil
,
tar
,
cordage
,
hemp
,
flax
,
and
other
highly
inflammable
articles
,
adjoining
the
church
,
had
caught
fire
,
and
the
flames
speedily
reached
the
sacred
fabric
.
<EOS>
The
glass
within
the
windows
was
shivered
;
the
stone
bars
split
asunder
;
and
the
seats
and
other
woodwork
withinside
catching
fire
,
the
flames
ascended
to
the
roof
,
and
kindled
its
massive
rafters
.
 
<EOS>
Great
efforts
were
now
made
to
check
the
fire
.
<EOS>
A
few
of
the
cumbrous
and
unmanageable
engines
of
the
day
were
brought
to
the
spot
,
but
no
water
could
be
obtained
.
<EOS>
All
the
aqueducts
,
pipes
,
and
sluices
were
dry
,
and
the
Thames
water
-
tower
was
found
to
be
out
of
order
,
and
the
pipes
connected
with
it
empty
.
<EOS>
To
add
to
the
calamity
,
the
tide
was
out
,
and
it
was
not
only
difficult
,
but
dangerous
,
to
obtain
water
from
the
river
.
<EOS>
The
scanty
supply
served
rather
to
increase
than
check
the
flames
.
<EOS>
All
sorts
of
rumours
prevailed
among
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
It
could
no
longer
be
doubted
that
the
fire
,
which
kept
continually
breaking
out
in
fresh
places
,
was
the
work
of
incendiaries
,
and
it
was
now
supposed
that
it
must
have
been
caused
by
the
French
or
the
Dutch
,
with
both
of
which
nations
the
country
was
then
at
war
,
and
the
most
fearful
anticipations
that
it
was
only
the
prelude
of
a
sudden
invasion
were
entertained
.
<EOS>
Some
conjectured
it
might
be
the
work
of
the
Papists
;
and
it
chancing
that
a
professor
of
that
religion
was
discovered
among
the
mob
,
he
was
with
difficulty
rescued
from
their
fury
by
the
watch
,
and
conveyed
to
Newgate
.
<EOS>
Other
persons
,
who
were
likewise
suspected
of
being
incendiaries
,
were
conveyed
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
though
it
satisfied
the
multitude
,
did
not
check
the
progress
of
the
fire
,
nor
put
a
stop
to
the
terror
and
tumult
that
prevailed
.
<EOS>
Every
moment
a
fresh
family
were
turned
into
the
street
,
and
by
their
cries
added
to
the
confusion
.
<EOS>
The
plunderers
had
formed
themselves
into
bands
,
pillaging
everything
they
could
lay
hands
on
--
carrying
off
boxes
,
goods
,
and
coffers
,
breaking
into
cellars
,
broaching
casks
of
spirits
and
ale
,
and
emptying
flasks
of
wine
.
<EOS>
Hundreds
of
persons
who
did
not
join
in
the
pillage
made
free
with
the
contents
of
the
cellars
,
and
a
large
portion
of
the
concourse
was
soon
in
a
state
of
intoxication
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
wild
laughter
and
exclamations
of
frenzied
mirth
were
heard
amid
the
wailings
of
women
and
the
piteous
cries
of
children
.
<EOS>
It
was
indeed
dreadful
to
see
the
old
and
bed
-
ridden
forced
into
the
street
to
seek
a
home
where
they
could
;
nor
yet
less
dreadful
to
behold
others
roused
from
a
bed
of
sickness
at
dead
of
night
,
and
by
such
a
fearful
summons
.
<EOS>
Still
,
fanned
by
the
wind
,
and
fed
by
a
thousand
combustible
matters
,
the
fire
pressed
fearfully
on
,
devouring
all
before
it
,
and
increasing
in
fury
and
power
each
instant
;
while
the
drunken
mob
laughed
,
roared
,
shouted
,
and
rejoiced
beside
it
,
as
if
in
emulation
of
the
raging
flames
.
 
<EOS>
To
proceed
for
a
moment
to
Wood
Street
.
<EOS>
When
Philip
Grant
quitted
Leonard
in
the
manner
before
related
,
the
latter
followed
him
to
the
door
,
and
saw
him
disappear
in
the
gloom
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
attempt
pursuit
,
because
he
could
not
persuade
himself
that
any
danger
was
really
to
be
apprehended
.
<EOS>
He
thought
it
,
however
,
advisable
to
consult
with
Mr.
Bloundel
on
the
subject
,
and
accordingly
proceeded
to
his
room
and
roused
him
.
 
<EOS>
After
hearing
what
had
occurred
,
the
grocer
looked
very
grave
,
and
said
,
"
I
am
not
disposed
to
treat
this
matter
so
lightly
as
you
do
,
Leonard
.
<EOS>
I
fear
this
unhappy
man
has
some
desperate
design
in
view
.
<EOS>
What
it
is
<EOS>
I
cannot
--
dare
not
--
<EOS>
conjecture
.
<EOS>
But
I
confess
I
am
full
of
apprehension
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
retire
to
rest
to
-
night
,
but
shall
hold
myself
in
readiness
to
act
in
whatever
way
may
be
necessary
,
You
had
better
go
forth
,
and
if
anything
occurs
,
give
notice
to
the
proper
authorities
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
now
such
a
lord
mayor
as
we
had
during
the
season
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
The
firm
and
courageous
Sir
John
Lawrence
is
but
ill
succeeded
by
the
weak
and
vacillating
Sir
Thomas
Bludworth
.
<EOS>
Still
,
the
latter
may
be
equal
to
this
emergency
,
and
if
anything
happens
,
you
must
apply
to
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
follow
your
advice
implicitly
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
I
think
there
is
nothing
to
apprehend
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
better
to
err
on
the
safe
side
,
"
observed
the
grocer
;
"
you
can
not
then
reproach
yourself
with
want
of
caution
.
"
 
<EOS>
Shortly
after
this
,
Leonard
sallied
forth
,
and
having
determined
what
course
to
pursue
in
the
first
instance
,
proceeded
to
Saint
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
He
found
every
door
in
the
sacred
structure
fast
closed
.
<EOS>
Not
satisfied
with
this
,
he
knocked
at
the
great
northern
entrance
till
the
summons
was
answered
by
a
verger
,
and
stating
his
object
,
demanded
to
be
admitted
,
and
to
search
the
cathedral
,
as
well
as
Saint
Faith
's
.
<EOS>
The
verger
offered
no
objection
,
and
having
examined
the
old
building
throughout
,
without
discovering
any
traces
of
the
person
he
was
in
quest
of
,
Leonard
quitted
it
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
ever
convinced
that
he
was
right
in
his
supposition
,
and
that
no
danger
was
to
be
apprehended
,
he
was
about
to
return
home
,
when
the
idea
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
perhaps
find
Grant
at
the
plague
-
pit
in
Finsbury
Fields
,
and
he
accordingly
shaped
his
course
thither
.
<EOS>
A
long
period
had
elapsed
since
he
had
last
visited
the
melancholy
spot
,
and
it
was
not
without
much
painful
emotion
that
he
drew
near
the
vast
mound
covering
the
victims
of
the
pestilence
.
<EOS>
But
Grant
was
not
there
,
and
though
he
paced
round
and
round
the
dreary
inclosure
for
some
time
,
no
one
came
.
<EOS>
He
then
proceeded
to
the
lesser
plague
-
pit
,
and
kneeling
beside
the
grave
of
Amabel
,
bedewed
it
with
his
tears
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
arose
,
with
the
intention
of
returning
to
Wood
Street
,
he
observed
an
extraordinary
light
in
the
sky
a
little
to
the
left
,
evidently
produced
by
the
reflection
of
a
great
fire
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
On
beholding
this
light
,
he
said
to
himself
,
"
Mr.
Bloundel
was
right
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
danger
with
which
the
city
is
threatened
.
<EOS>
It
is
now
too
late
to
avert
it
.
"
<EOS>
Determined
,
however
,
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
calamity
without
an
instant
's
loss
of
time
,
he
set
off
at
a
swift
pace
,
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
reached
Fish
Street
Hill
,
and
stood
beside
the
conflagration
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
nearly
three
o'clock
,
and
a
vast
chasm
of
blackening
ruins
proclaimed
the
devastation
that
had
been
committed
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
arrived
,
the
roof
of
Saint
Margaret
's
fell
in
with
a
tremendous
crash
,
and
for
a
few
minutes
the
fire
was
subdued
.
<EOS>
It
then
arose
with
greater
fury
than
ever
;
burst
out
on
both
sides
of
the
sacred
structure
,
and
caught
the
line
of
houses
leading
towards
London
Bridge
.
<EOS>
The
first
house
was
that
of
a
vintner
;
and
the
lower
part
of
the
premises
--
the
cellars
and
vaults
--
were
filled
with
wine
and
spirits
.
<EOS>
These
instantly
blazed
up
,
and
burnt
with
such
intensity
that
the
adjoining
habitation
was
presently
in
flames
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
who
hath
done
all
this
!
"
exclaimed
Leonard
,
half
involuntarily
,
as
he
gazed
on
the
work
of
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
a
bystander
,
gazing
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
is
it?--the
Dutchman
or
the
Frenchman
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Neither
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
who
at
that
moment
discovered
Grant
among
the
group
opposite
him
.
"
<EOS>
Yonder
stands
the
incendiary
!
"

<EOS>
PROGRESS
OF
THE
FIRE
.
 
<EOS>
Instantly
surrounded
and
seized
by
the
mob
,
Grant
offered
no
resistance
,
but
demanded
to
be
led
with
his
accuser
before
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
Almost
as
the
words
were
uttered
,
a
cry
was
raised
that
the
lord
mayor
and
the
sheriffs
were
coming
along
East
-
cheap
,
and
the
prisoner
and
Leonard
were
immediately
hurried
off
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
They
met
the
civic
authorities
at
the
corner
of
Saint
Clement's
-
lane
;
but
instead
of
paying
any
attention
to
them
,
the
lord
mayor
,
who
appeared
to
be
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
and
excitement
,
ordered
the
javelin
-
men
,
by
whom
he
was
attended
,
to
push
the
mob
aside
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
delay
your
worship
an
instant
,
"
cried
Leonard
;
"
but
this
dreadful
fire
is
the
work
of
incendiaries
,
of
whom
that
man
,
"
pointing
to
Grant
,
"
is
the
principal
.
<EOS>
I
pray
your
worship
to
question
him
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
important
revelations
to
make
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
what
?
"
cried
the
lord
mayor
,
addressing
Grant
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
true
you
are
an
incendiary
?
<EOS>
Who
are
your
accomplices
?
<EOS>
Where
are
they
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
none
,
"
replied
Grant
,
boldly--"I
deny
the
charge
altogether
.
<EOS>
Let
my
accuser
prove
it
if
he
can
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
hear
what
he
says
,
young
man
,
"
said
the
mayor
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
see
him
set
fire
to
any
house
?
<EOS>
Did
you
find
any
fire
-
balls
on
his
person
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
searched
him
,
your
worship
,
"
cried
Chowles
,
who
was
among
the
bystanders
,
"
the
moment
he
was
seized
,
and
found
nothing
upon
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
false
and
malicious
charge
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
looks
like
it
,
I
must
say
,
"
<EOS>
replied
the
mayor
.
<EOS>
"
On
what
grounds
do
you
accuse
him
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
angrily
,
to
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
these
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
He
came
to
me
three
hours
ago
,
and
confessed
that
he
had
a
desperate
design
against
the
safety
of
the
city
,
and
made
certain
proposals
to
me
,
to
which
I
would
not
listen
.
<EOS>
This
is
not
the
season
for
a
full
explanation
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
But
I
pray
your
worship
,
as
you
value
the
welfare
of
the
city
,
to
have
him
secured
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
no
harm
in
that
,
"
replied
the
lord
mayor
.
<EOS>
"
His
appearance
is
decidedly
against
him
.
<EOS>
Let
him
be
taken
care
of
till
the
morrow
,
when
I
will
examine
further
into
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Your
name
and
place
of
abode
,
young
man
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
called
Leonard
Holt
,
and
my
business
is
that
of
a
grocer
,
in
Wood
-
street
,
"
was
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
,
"
rejoined
the
mayor
.
<EOS>
"
Take
away
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
I
will
hear
nothing
further
now
.
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
how
the
fire
rages
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
the
whole
city
burnt
down
,
if
we
do
not
take
care
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
we
shall
,
indeed
,
"
replied
Sir
Robert
Viner
,
one
of
the
sheriffs
,
"
unless
the
most
prompt
and
decisive
measures
are
immediately
adopted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
recommend
?
"
cried
the
lord
mayor
,
despairingly
.
<EOS>
Sir
Robert
looked
perplexed
by
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
might
offer
an
opinion
,
"
interposed
Leonard
,
"
I
would
advise
your
worship
to
pull
down
all
the
houses
in
the
way
of
the
fire
,
as
the
only
means
of
checking
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pull
down
the
houses
!
"
cried
the
lord
mayor
.
<EOS>
"
Who
ever
heard
of
such
an
idea
?
<EOS>
Why
,
that
would
be
worse
than
the
fire
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
;
that
will
never
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
young
man
is
in
the
right
,
"
observed
Sir
Joseph
Sheldon
,
the
other
sheriff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
--
we
shall
see
,
"
replied
the
mayor
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
are
losing
time
here
.
<EOS>
Forward
!
<EOS>
forward
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
while
Grant
was
borne
off
to
Newgate
by
a
guard
of
javelin
-
men
,
the
lord
mayor
and
his
company
proceeded
to
Fish
-
street
-
hill
,
where
the
whole
conflagration
burst
upon
them
.
<EOS>
The
moment
the
lord
mayor
appeared
,
he
was
beset
on
all
sides
by
hundreds
of
families
soliciting
his
protection
.
<EOS>
Others
came
to
give
him
the
alarming
intelligence
that
a
very
scanty
supply
of
water
only
could
be
obtained
,
and
that
already
two
engines
had
been
destroyed
,
while
the
firemen
who
worked
them
had
narrowly
escaped
with
life
.
<EOS>
Others
again
pressed
him
for
instructions
how
to
act
--
some
suggesting
one
plan
--
some
another,--and
being
of
a
weak
and
irresolute
character
,
and
utterly
unequal
to
a
fearful
emergency
like
the
present
,
he
was
completely
bewildered
.
<EOS>
Bidding
the
houseless
families
take
refuge
in
the
churches
,
he
ordered
certain
officers
to
attend
them
,
and
affecting
to
doubt
the
statement
of
those
who
affirmed
there
was
no
water
,
advised
them
to
go
to
the
river
,
where
they
would
find
plenty
.
<EOS>
In
vain
they
assured
him
the
tide
was
out
,
the
Thames
water
-
tower
empty
,
the
pipes
and
conduits
dry
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
believe
anything
of
the
sort
,
but
upbraiding
his
informants
with
neglect
,
bade
them
try
again
.
<EOS>
As
to
instructions
,
he
could
give
none
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
a
reluctant
assent
being
wrung
from
him
by
Sir
Joseph
Sheldon
,
that
a
house
should
be
pulled
down
,
as
suggested
by
Leonard
<EOS>
,
preparations
were
instantly
made
for
putting
the
design
into
execution
.
<EOS>
The
house
selected
was
about
four
doors
from
the
top
of
Fish
-
street
-
hill
,
and
belonged
to
a
birdcage
-
maker
.
<EOS>
But
they
encountered
an
unexpected
opposition
.
<EOS>
Having
ascertained
their
purpose
,
the
owner
fastened
his
doors
,
and
refused
to
admit
them
.
<EOS>
He
harangued
the
mob
from
one
of
the
upper
windows
,
and
producing
a
pistol
,
threatened
to
fire
upon
them
if
they
attempted
to
gain
a
forcible
entrance
.
<EOS>
The
officers
,
however
,
having
received
their
orders
,
were
not
to
be
intimidated
,
and
commenced
breaking
down
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
birdcage
-
maker
then
fired
,
but
without
effect
;
and
before
he
had
time
to
reload
,
the
door
had
yielded
to
the
combined
efforts
of
the
multitude
,
who
were
greatly
enraged
at
his
strange
conduct
.
<EOS>
They
rushed
upstairs
,
but
finding
he
had
locked
himself
in
the
room
,
left
him
there
,
supposing
him
secure
,
and
commenced
the
work
of
demolition
.
<EOS>
More
than
a
hundred
men
were
engaged
in
the
task
;
but
though
they
used
the
utmost
exertion
,
they
had
little
more
than
unroofed
the
building
,
when
a
cry
was
raised
by
those
in
the
street
that
the
house
was
on
fire
.
<EOS>
Alarmed
by
the
shout
,
they
descended
,
and
found
the
report
true
.
<EOS>
Flames
were
issuing
from
the
room
lately
occupied
by
the
birdcage
-
maker
.
<EOS>
The
wretch
had
set
fire
to
his
dwelling
,
and
then
made
his
escape
with
his
family
by
a
back
staircase
.
<EOS>
Thus
defeated
,
the
workmen
,
with
bitter
imprecations
on
the
fugitive
,
withdrew
,
and
Leonard
,
who
had
lent
his
best
assistance
to
the
task
,
repaired
to
the
lord
mayor
.
<EOS>
He
found
him
in
greater
consternation
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
go
further
off
,
if
we
would
do
any
good
,
"
said
Leonard
;
"
and
as
the
present
plan
is
evidently
too
slow
,
we
must
have
recourse
to
gunpowder
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Gunpowder
!
"
exclaimed
the
lord
mayor
.
<EOS>
"
Would
you
blow
up
the
city
,
like
a
second
Guy
Fawkes
?
<EOS>
I
begin
to
suspect
you
are
one
of
the
incendiaries
yourself
,
young
man
.
<EOS>
Lord
,
Lord
!
<EOS>
what
will
become
of
us
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
your
worship
disapproves
of
my
suggestion
,
at
least
give
orders
what
is
to
be
done
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
all
I
can
,
"
replied
the
mayor
.
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
that
talk
to
me
thus
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
your
worship
I
am
a
simple
tradesman
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
have
the
welfare
of
the
city
at
heart
,
and
I
can
not
stand
by
and
see
it
burnt
to
the
ground
without
an
effort
to
save
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
I
dare
say
you
mean
very
well
,
young
man
,
"
rejoined
the
lord
mayor
,
somewhat
pacified
.
"
<EOS>
But
do
n't
you
perceive
it
's
impossible
to
stop
such
a
fire
as
this
without
water
,
or
engines
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
would
willingly
lay
down
my
life
to
preserve
the
city
.
<EOS>
But
what
can
I
do?--what
can
any
man
do
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Much
may
be
done
if
there
is
resolution
to
attempt
it
,
"
returned
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
recommend
your
worship
to
proceed
,
in
the
first
place
,
to
the
wharves
on
the
banks
of
the
Thames
,
and
cause
the
removal
of
the
wood
,
coal
,
and
other
combustible
matter
with
which
they
are
crowded
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
thought
of
,
"
cried
the
lord
mayor
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
thither
at
once
.
<EOS>
Do
you
stay
here
.
<EOS>
Your
advice
will
be
useful
.
<EOS>
I
will
examine
you
touching
the
incendiary
to
-
morrow
--
that
is
,
if
we
are
any
of
us
left
alive
,
which
I
do
n't
expect
.
<EOS>
Lord
,
Lord
!
<EOS>
what
will
become
of
us
?
"
<EOS>
And
with
many
similar
ejaculations
,
he
hurried
off
with
the
sheriffs
,
and
the
greater
part
of
his
attendants
,
and
taking
his
way
down
Saint
Michael's
-
lane
,
soon
reached
the
river
-
side
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
fire
had
approached
the
summit
of
Fish
-
street
-
hill
,
and
here
the
overhanging
stories
of
the
houses
coming
so
close
together
as
almost
to
meet
at
the
top
,
the
flames
speedily
caught
the
other
side
,
and
spread
the
conflagration
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
Two
other
houses
were
likewise
discovered
to
be
on
fire
in
Crooked
-
lane
,
and
in
an
incredibly
short
space
the
whole
dense
mass
of
habitations
lying
at
the
west
side
of
Fish
-
street
-
hill
,
and
between
Crooked
-
lane
and
Eastcheap
,
were
in
flames
,
and
threatening
the
venerable
church
of
Saint
Michael
,
which
stood
in
the
midst
of
them
,
with
instant
destruction
.
<EOS>
To
the
astonishment
of
all
who
witnessed
it
,
the
conflagration
seemed
to
proceed
as
rapidly
against
the
wind
,
as
with
it
,
and
to
be
approaching
Thames
-
street
,
both
by
Pudding
-
lane
and
Saint
Michael's
-
lane
.
<EOS>
A
large
stable
,
filled
with
straw
and
hay
,
at
the
back
of
the
Star
Inn
,
in
Little
Eastcheap
,
caught
fire
,
and
carrying
the
conflagration
eastward
,
had
already
conveyed
it
as
far
as
Botolph
-
lane
.
 
<EOS>
It
chanced
that
a
poor
Catholic
priest
,
travelling
from
Douay
to
England
,
had
landed
that
night
,
and
taken
up
his
quarters
at
the
hotel
above
mentioned
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
,
who
had
been
roused
by
the
cries
of
fire
,
and
alarmed
by
the
rumours
of
incendiaries
,
immediately
called
to
mind
his
guest
,
and
dragging
him
from
his
room
,
thrust
him
,
half
-
naked
,
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
Announcing
his
conviction
that
the
poor
priest
was
an
incendiary
to
the
mob
without
,
they
seized
him
,
and
in
spite
of
his
protestations
and
explanations
,
which
,
being
uttered
in
a
foreign
tongue
,
they
could
not
comprehend
,
they
were
about
to
exercise
summary
punishment
upon
him
,
by
hanging
him
to
the
sign
-
post
before
the
landlord
's
door
,
when
they
were
diverted
from
their
dreadful
purpose
by
Solomon
Eagle
,
who
prevailed
upon
them
to
carry
him
to
Newgate
.
 
<EOS>
The
conflagration
had
now
assumed
so
terrific
a
character
that
it
appalled
even
the
stoutest
spectator
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
mentioned
,
that
for
many
weeks
previous
to
the
direful
calamity
,
the
weather
had
been
remarkably
dry
and
warm
,
a
circumstance
which
had
prepared
the
old
wooden
houses
,
abounding
in
this
part
of
the
city
,
for
almost
instantaneous
ignition
.
<EOS>
Added
to
this
,
if
the
incendiaries
themselves
had
deposited
combustible
materials
at
certain
spots
to
extend
the
conflagration
,
they
could
not
have
selected
better
places
than
accident
had
arranged
.
<EOS>
All
sorts
of
inflammable
goods
were
contained
in
the
shops
and
ware
-
houses,--oil
,
hemp
,
flax
,
pitch
,
tar
,
cordage
,
sugar
,
wine
,
and
spirits
;
and
when
any
magazine
of
this
sort
caught
fire
,
it
spread
the
conflagration
with
tenfold
rapidity
.
 
<EOS>
The
heat
of
the
flames
had
now
become
almost
insufferable
,
and
the
sparks
and
flakes
of
fire
fell
so
fast
and
thick
,
that
the
spectators
were
compelled
to
retreat
to
a
considerable
distance
from
the
burning
buildings
.
<EOS>
The
noise
occasioned
by
the
cracking
of
the
timbers
,
and
the
falling
of
walls
and
roofs
,
was
awful
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
All
the
avenues
and
thoroughfares
near
the
fire
were
now
choked
up
by
carts
,
coaches
,
and
other
vehicles
,
which
had
been
hastily
brought
thither
to
remove
the
goods
of
the
inhabitants
,
and
the
hurry
of
the
poor
people
to
save
a
wreck
of
their
property
,
and
the
attempts
made
by
the
gangs
of
plunderers
to
deprive
them
of
it
,
constituted
a
scene
of
unparalleled
tumult
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
As
yet
,
no
troops
had
appeared
to
maintain
order
,
and
seeing
that
as
much
mischief
was
almost
done
by
the
plunderers
as
by
the
fire
<EOS>
,
Leonard
determined
to
go
in
search
of
the
lord
mayor
,
and
acquaint
him
with
the
mischief
that
was
occurring
.
<EOS>
Having
heard
that
the
fire
had
already
reached
London
Bridge
,
he
resolved
to
ascertain
whether
the
report
was
true
.
<EOS>
As
he
proceeded
down
Saint
Michael's
-
lane
,
he
found
the
venerable
church
from
which
it
was
designated
on
fire
,
and
with
some
difficulty
forcing
his
way
through
the
crowd
,
reached
Thames
-
street
,
where
he
discovered
that
the
conflagration
had
even
made
more
fearful
progress
than
he
had
anticipated
.
<EOS>
Fishmongers
'
Hall
,
a
large
square
structure
,
was
on
fire
,
and
burning
swiftly,--the
flames
encircling
its
high
roof
,
and
the
turret
by
which
it
was
surmounted
.
<EOS>
Streams
of
fire
,
too
,
had
darted
down
the
numerous
narrow
alleys
leading
to
the
river
-
side
,
and
reaching
the
wharves
,
had
kindled
the
heaps
of
wood
and
coal
with
which
they
were
filled
.
<EOS>
The
party
under
the
command
of
the
lord
mayor
had
used
their
utmost
exertions
to
get
rid
of
these
combustible
materials
by
flinging
them
into
the
Thames
;
but
they
came
too
late
,
and
were
driven
away
by
the
approach
of
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
barges
and
heavy
craft
were
aground
,
and
they
,
too
,
caught
fire
,
and
were
burned
,
with
their
contents
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
he
could
neither
render
any
assistance
,
nor
obtain
speech
with
the
lord
mayor
,
and
anxious
to
behold
the
terrible
yet
sublime
spectacle
from
the
river
,
Leonard
hastened
to
Old
Swan
-
Stairs
,
and
springing
into
a
boat
,
ordered
the
waterman
to
row
into
the
middle
of
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
He
could
then
discern
the
full
extent
of
the
conflagration
,
and
trace
the
progress
it
was
making
.
<EOS>
All
the
houses
between
Fishmongers
'
Hall
and
the
bridge
were
on
fire
,
and
behind
them
rose
a
vast
sheet
of
flame
.
<EOS>
Saint
Magnus
'
Church
,
at
the
foot
of
the
bridge
,
was
next
seized
by
the
flame
,
and
Leonard
watched
its
destruction
.
<EOS>
An
ancient
gateway
followed
,
and
soon
afterwards
a
large
stack
of
houses
erected
upon
the
bridge
burst
into
flames
.
 
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
of
the
houses
on
the
bridge
,
having
now
become
thoroughly
alarmed
,
flung
bedding
,
boxes
,
and
articles
of
furniture
,
out
of
their
windows
into
the
river
.
<EOS>
A
crowd
of
boats
surrounded
the
starlings
,
and
the
terrified
occupants
of
the
structures
above
descending
to
them
by
the
staircases
in
the
interior
of
the
piers
,
embarked
with
every
article
they
could
carry
off
.
<EOS>
The
river
presented
a
most
extraordinary
scene
.
<EOS>
Lighted
by
the
red
and
fierce
reflection
of
the
fire
,
and
covered
with
boats
,
filled
with
families
who
had
just
quitted
their
habitations
either
on
the
bridge
or
in
some
other
street
adjoining
it
,
its
whole
surface
was
speckled
with
pieces
of
furniture
,
or
goods
,
that
had
been
cast
into
it
,
and
which
were
now
floating
up
with
the
tide
.
<EOS>
Great
crowds
were
collected
on
the
Southwark
shore
to
watch
the
conflagration
,
while
on
the
opposite
side
the
wharves
and
quays
were
thronged
with
persons
removing
their
goods
,
and
embarking
them
in
boats
.
<EOS>
One
circumstance
,
noted
by
Pepys
,
and
which
also
struck
Leonard
,
was
the
singular
attachment
displayed
by
the
pigeons
,
kept
by
the
owners
of
several
houses
on
the
bridge
,
to
the
spots
they
had
been
accustomed
to
.
<EOS>
Even
when
the
flames
attacked
the
buildings
to
which
the
dovecots
were
attached
,
the
birds
wheeled
round
and
round
them
,
until
,
their
pinions
being
scorched
by
the
fire
,
they
dropped
into
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
Leonard
remained
on
the
river
nearly
two
hours
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
in
fact
,
tear
himself
away
from
the
spectacle
,
which
possessed
a
strange
fascination
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
think
that
all
the
efforts
of
men
were
unavailing
to
arrest
the
progress
of
destruction
,
and
he
was
for
awhile
content
to
regard
it
as
a
mere
spectacle
.
<EOS>
And
never
had
he
beheld
a
more
impressive
--
a
more
terrible
sight
.
<EOS>
There
lay
the
vast
and
populous
city
before
him
,
which
he
had
once
before
known
to
be
invaded
by
an
invisible
but
extirminating
foe
,
now
attacked
by
a
furious
and
far
-
seen
enemy
.
<EOS>
The
fire
seemed
to
form
a
vast
arch
--
many
-
coloured
as
a
rainbow,--reflected
in
the
sky
,
and
re
-
reflected
in
all
its
horrible
splendour
in
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
the
aspect
of
the
city
less
striking
.
<EOS>
The
innumerable
towers
and
spires
of
the
churches
rose
tall
and
dark
through
the
wavering
sheet
of
flame
,
and
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
one
of
them
would
topple
down
or
disappear
,
as
if
swallowed
up
by
the
devouring
element
.
<EOS>
For
a
short
space
,
the
fire
seemed
to
observe
a
regular
progressive
movement
,
but
when
it
fell
upon
better
material
,
it
reared
its
blazing
crest
aloft
,
changed
its
hues
,
and
burnt
with
redoubled
intensity
.
<EOS>
Leonard
watched
it
thread
narrow
alleys
,
and
firing
every
lesser
habitation
in
its
course
,
kindle
some
great
hall
or
other
structure
,
whose
remoteness
seemed
to
secure
it
from
immediate
danger
.
<EOS>
At
this
distance
,
the
roaring
of
the
flames
resembled
that
of
a
thousand
furnaces
.
<EOS>
Ever
and
anon
,
it
was
broken
by
a
sound
like
thunder
,
occasioned
by
the
fall
of
some
mighty
edifice
.
<EOS>
Then
there
would
come
a
quick
succession
of
reports
like
the
discharge
of
artillery
,
followed
by
a
shower
of
fiery
flakes
and
sparks
blown
aloft
,
like
the
explosion
of
some
stupendous
firework
.
<EOS>
Mixed
with
the
roaring
of
the
flames
,
the
thunder
of
falling
roofs
,
the
cracking
of
timber
,
was
a
wild
hubbub
of
human
voices
,
that
sounded
afar
off
like
a
dismal
wail
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
its
terror
,
the
appearance
of
the
fire
was
at
that
time
beautiful
beyond
description
.
<EOS>
Its
varying
colours
--
its
fanciful
forms
--
now
shooting
out
in
a
hundred
different
directions
,
like
lightning
-
flashes,--now
drawing
itself
up
,
as
it
were
,
and
soaring
aloft,--now
splitting
into
a
million
tongues
of
flame,--these
aspects
so
riveted
the
attention
of
Leonard
,
that
he
almost
forgot
in
the
sight
the
dreadful
devastation
going
forward
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
ached
with
gazing
at
the
fiery
spectacle
,
and
he
was
glad
to
rest
them
on
the
black
masses
of
building
that
stood
in
stern
relief
against
it
,
and
which
there
could
be
little
doubt
would
soon
become
its
prey
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
now
broad
daylight
,
except
for
the
mighty
cloud
of
smoke
,
which
o'er
-
canopied
the
city
,
creating
an
artificial
gloom
.
<EOS>
Leonard
's
troubled
gaze
wandered
from
the
scene
of
destruction
to
Saint
Paul's
--
an
edifice
,
<EOS>
which
;
from
the
many
events
connected
with
his
fortunes
that
had
occurred
there
,
had
always
a
singular
interest
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
Calling
to
mind
the
denunciations
poured
forth
by
Solomon
Eagle
against
this
fane
,
he
could
not
help
fearing
they
would
now
be
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
What
added
to
his
misgivings
was
,
that
it
was
now
almost
entirely
surrounded
by
poles
and
scaffolding
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
the
cessation
of
the
plague
,
the
repairs
,
suspended
during
that
awful
season
,
had
been
recommenced
under
the
superintendence
of
Doctor
Christopher
Wren
,
and
were
now
proceeding
with
renewed
activity
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
the
building
was
under
repair
,
and
a
vast
number
of
masons
were
employed
upon
it
,
and
it
was
their
scaffolding
that
impressed
Leonard
with
a
dread
of
what
afterwards
actually
occurred
.
<EOS>
Accustomed
to
connect
the
figure
of
Solomon
Eagle
with
the
sacred
structure
,
he
could
not
help
fancying
that
he
discovered
a
speck
resembling
a
human
figure
on
the
central
tower
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
the
enthusiast
,
what
must
his
feelings
be
at
finding
his
predictions
so
fatally
fulfilled
?
<EOS>
Little
did
Leonard
think
how
the
prophecy
had
been
accomplished
!
 
<EOS>
But
his
attention
was
speedily
called
to
the
progress
of
the
conflagration
.
<EOS>
From
the
increased
tumult
in
the
city
,
it
was
evident
<EOS>
the
inhabitants
were
now
thoroughly
roused
,
and
actively
bestirring
themselves
to
save
their
property
.
<EOS>
This
was
apparent
,
even
on
the
river
,
from
the
multitude
of
boats
deeply
laden
with
goods
of
all
kinds
,
which
were
now
seen
shaping
their
course
towards
Westminster
.
<EOS>
The
fire
,
also
,
had
made
rapid
progress
on
all
sides
.
<EOS>
The
vast
pile
of
habitations
at
the
north
side
of
the
bridge
was
now
entirely
in
flames
.
<EOS>
The
effect
of
this
was
awfully
fine
.
<EOS>
Not
only
did
the
flames
mount
to
a
greater
height
,
and
appear
singularly
conspicuous
from
the
situation
of
the
houses
,
but
every
instant
some
blazing
fragment
fell
with
a
tremendous
splash
into
the
water
,
where
it
hissed
for
a
moment
,
and
then
was
for
ever
quenched
,
floating
a
black
mass
upon
the
surface
.
<EOS>
From
the
foot
of
the
bridge
to
Coal
Harbour
Stairs
,
extended
what
Dryden
finely
calls
"
a
quay
of
fire
.
<EOS>
"
All
the
wharves
and
warehouses
were
in
flames
,
and
burning
with
astonishing
rapidity
,
while
this
part
of
Thames
-
street
,
"
the
lodge
of
all
combustibles
,
"
had
likewise
become
a
prey
to
the
devouring
element
.
<EOS>
The
fire
,
too
,
had
spread
in
an
easterly
direction
,
and
consuming
three
churches
,
namely
,
Saint
Andrew
's
,
in
Botolph
-
lane
,
Saint
Mary
's
,
in
Love
-
lane
,
and
Saint
Dunstan
's
in
the
East
,
had
invaded
Tower
-
street
,
and
seemed
fast
approaching
the
ancient
fortress
.
<EOS>
So
fascinated
was
Leonard
with
the
sight
,
that
he
could
have
been
well
content
to
remain
all
day
gazing
at
it
,
but
he
now
recollected
that
he
had
other
duties
to
perform
,
and
directing
the
waterman
to
land
him
at
Queenhithe
,
ascended
Bread
-
street
-
hill
,
and
betook
himself
to
Wood
-
street
.

LEONARD
'S
INTERVIEW
WITH
THE
KING
.
 
<EOS>
Some
rumours
of
the
conflagration
,
as
will
be
supposed
,
had
ere
<EOS>
this
reached
Mr.
Bloundel
,
but
he
had
no
idea
of
the
extent
of
the
direful
calamity
,
and
when
informed
of
it
by
Leonard
,
lifted
up
his
hands
despairingly
,
exclaiming
,
in
accents
of
the
deepest
affliction--"Another
judgment
,
then
,
has
fallen
upon
this
sinful
city,--another
judgment
yet
more
terrible
than
the
first
.
<EOS>
Man
may
have
kindled
this
great
fire
,
but
the
hand
of
God
is
apparent
in
it
.
'
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
for
thee
,
thou
great
city
,
Babylon
!
<EOS>
Alas
for
thee
,
thou
mighty
city
!
<EOS>
for
in
one
hour
is
thy
judgment
come
.
<EOS>
The
kings
of
the
earth
shall
bewail
thee
,
and
lament
for
thee
,
when
they
see
the
smoke
of
thy
burning
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
dwelling
was
spared
in
the
last
visitation
,
sir
,
"
observed
Leonard
,
after
a
pause
,
"
and
you
were
able
to
shut
yourself
up
,
as
in
a
strong
castle
,
against
the
all
-
exterminating
foe
.
<EOS>
But
I
fear
you
will
not
be
able
to
ward
off
the
assaults
of
the
present
enemy
,
and
recommend
you
to
remove
your
family
and
goods
without
delay
to
some
place
of
security
far
from
this
doomed
city
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
Lord
's
Day
,
Leonard
,
and
must
be
kept
holy
,
"
replied
the
grocer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
,
if
I
am
spared
so
long
,
I
will
endeavour
to
find
some
place
of
shelter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
the
conflagration
continues
to
spread
as
rapidly
as
it
is
now
doing
,
to
-
morrow
will
be
too
late
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
,
"
returned
the
grocer
,
"
but
I
will
not
violate
the
Sabbath
.
<EOS>
If
the
safety
of
my
family
is
threatened
,
that
is
another
matter
,
but
I
will
not
attempt
to
preserve
my
goods
.
<EOS>
Do
not
,
however
,
let
me
influence
you
.
<EOS>
Take
such
portion
of
our
stock
as
belongs
to
you
,
and
you
know
that
a
third
of
the
whole
is
yours
,
and
convey
it
where
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
no
account
,
sir
,
"
interrupted
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
never
think
of
acting
in
opposition
to
your
wishes
.
<EOS>
This
will
be
a
sad
Sunday
for
London
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
saddest
she
has
ever
seen
,
"
replied
the
grocer
;
"
for
though
the
voice
of
prayer
was
silenced
in
her
churches
during
the
awful
season
of
the
plague
,
yet
then
men
's
minds
had
been
gradually
prepared
for
the
calamity
,
and
though
filled
with
terror
,
they
were
not
taken
by
surprise
,
as
must
now
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
But
let
us
to
prayers
,
and
may
our
earnest
supplications
avail
in
turning
aside
the
Divine
displeasure
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
summoning
his
family
and
household
,
all
of
whom
were
by
this
time
stirring
,
and
in
the
utmost
consternation
at
what
they
had
heard
of
the
fire
,
he
commenced
a
prayer
adapted
to
the
occasion
in
a
strain
of
the
utmost
fervour
;
and
as
Leonard
gazed
at
his
austere
countenance
,
now
lighted
up
with
holy
zeal
,
and
listened
to
his
earnest
intercessions
in
behalf
of
the
devoted
city
,
he
was
reminded
of
the
prophet
Jeremiah
weeping
for
Jerusalem
before
the
throne
of
grace
.
 
<EOS>
Prayers
over
,
the
whole
party
sat
down
to
their
morning
repast
,
after
which
,
the
grocer
and
his
eldest
son
,
accompanied
by
Leonard
and
Blaize
,
mounted
to
the
roof
of
the
house
,
and
gazing
in
the
direction
of
the
conflagration
,
they
could
plainly
distinguish
the
vast
cloud
of
yellow
smoke
commingled
with
flame
that
marked
the
scene
of
its
ravages
.
<EOS>
As
the
wind
blew
from
this
quarter
,
charged
,
as
has
been
stated
,
with
a
cloud
of
sparks
,
many
of
the
fire
-
drops
were
dashed
in
their
faces
,
and
compelled
them
to
shade
their
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
same
awful
roar
which
Leonard
had
heard
on
the
river
likewise
broke
upon
their
ears
,
while
from
all
the
adjoining
streets
arose
a
wild
clamour
of
human
voices
,
the
burden
of
whose
cries
was
"
Fire
!
<EOS>
Fire
!
"
<EOS>
The
church
bells
,
which
should
have
been
tolling
to
early
devotion
,
were
now
loudly
ringing
the
alarm
,
while
their
towers
were
crowded
,
as
were
the
roofs
of
most
of
the
houses
,
with
persons
gazing
towards
the
scene
of
devastation
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
opposite
to
the
stillness
and
quiet
of
a
Sabbath
morn
;
and
as
the
grocer
listened
to
the
noise
and
tumult
prevailing
around
him
,
he
could
not
repress
a
groan
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
thought
my
ears
would
be
so
much
offended
on
this
day
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
down
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
and
heard
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
then
descended
,
and
Stephen
Bloundel
,
who
was
greatly
alarmed
by
what
he
had
just
witnessed
,
strongly
urged
his
father
to
remove
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
seasons
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
"
when
even
our
duty
to
Heaven
becomes
a
secondary
consideration
;
and
I
should
be
sorry
if
the
fruit
of
your
industry
were
sacrificed
to
your
religious
scruples
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
are
no
such
seasons
,
"
replied
the
grocer
,
severely
;
"
and
I
am
grieved
that
a
son
of
mine
should
think
so
.
<EOS>
If
the
inhabitants
of
this
sinful
city
had
not
broken
the
Sabbath
,
and
neglected
God
's
commandments
,
this
heavy
judgment
would
not
have
fallen
upon
them
.
<EOS>
I
shall
neglect
no
precaution
for
the
personal
safety
of
my
family
,
but
I
place
my
worldly
goods
in
the
hands
of
Him
from
whom
I
derived
them
,
and
to
whom
I
am
ready
to
restore
them
,
whenever
it
shall
please
Him
to
take
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
rebuked
,
father
,
"
replied
Stephen
,
humbly
;
"
and
entreat
your
pardon
for
having
ventured
to
differ
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
now
fully
sensible
of
the
propriety
of
your
conduct
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
have
ever
acquiesced
in
your
wishes
,
be
they
what
they
may
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bloundel
to
her
husband
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
confess
I
am
dreadfully
frightened
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
remove
the
first
thing
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
When
midnight
has
struck
,
and
the
Sabbath
is
past
,
I
shall
commence
my
preparations
,
"
replied
the
grocer
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
rest
content
till
then
.
"
Mrs.
Bloundel
heaved
a
sigh
,
but
said
no
more
;
and
the
grocer
,
retiring
to
a
side
-
table
,
opened
the
Bible
,
and
sat
down
calmly
to
its
perusal
.
<EOS>
But
though
no
further
remonstrances
reached
his
ears
,
there
was
great
murmuring
in
the
kitchen
on
the
part
of
Blaize
and
Patience
.
 
<EOS>
"
Goodness
knows
what
will
become
of
us
!
"
cried
the
latter
.
<EOS>
"
I
expect
we
shall
all
be
burnt
alive
,
owing
to
our
master
's
obstinacy
.
<EOS>
What
harm
can
there
be
in
moving
on
a
Sunday
,
I
should
like
to
know
?
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
'm
too
much
hurried
and
flurried
to
say
my
prayers
as
I
ought
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
so
am
I
,
"
replied
Blaize
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
is
a
great
deal
too
particular
.
<EOS>
What
a
dreadful
thing
it
would
be
if
the
house
should
be
burnt
down
,
and
all
my
mother
's
savings
,
which
were
to
form
a
provision
for
our
marriage
,
lost
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
would
be
terrible
,
indeed
,
"
cried
Patience
,
with
a
look
of
dismay
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
wedding
had
better
take
place
as
soon
as
the
fire
is
over
.
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
last
many
days
if
it
goes
on
at
this
rate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
"
returned
Blaize
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
objection
.
<EOS>
I
'll
speak
to
my
mother
at
once
.
"
<EOS>
And
stepping
into
the
scullery
,
where
old
Josyna
was
washing
some
dishes
,
he
addressed
her--"Mother
,
I
'm
sadly
afraid
this
great
fire
will
reach
us
before
our
master
will
allow
us
to
move
.
<EOS>
Had
n't
you
better
let
me
take
care
of
the
money
you
intended
giving
me
on
my
marriage
with
Patience
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
myn
goed
zoon
,
"
replied
Josyna
,
shaking
her
head--"I
musd
zee
you
married
virsd
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
ca
n't
be
married
to
-
day
,
"
cried
<EOS>
Blaize--"and
there
's
no
time
to
lose
.
<EOS>
The
fire
will
be
upon
us
directly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
cand
help
dat
,
"
returned
his
mother
.
<EOS>
"
We
musd
place
our
drusd
in
God
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
I
quite
agree
with
you
,
mother
,
"
replied
Blaize
;
"
but
we
must
also
take
care
of
ourselves
.
<EOS>
If
you
wo
n't
give
me
the
money
,
at
least
put
it
in
a
box
to
carry
off
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
afraid
,
myn
zoon
,
"
replied
Josyna
.
<EOS>
"
I
wond
forged
i
d
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sadly
afraid
you
will
,
though
,
"
muttered
Blaize
,
as
he
walked
away
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
doing
any
good
with
her
,
"
he
added
to
Patience
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
as
obstinate
as
Mr.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
the
fire
of
all
things
;
but
I
suppose
I
musn't
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
,
"
replied
Patience
,
pettishly
;
"
at
such
a
time
it
would
be
highly
improper
.
<EOS>
I
forbid
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
must
need
submit
,
"
groaned
Blaize--"I
ca
n't
even
have
my
own
way
before
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
When
the
proper
time
arrived
,
the
grocer
,
accompanied
by
all
his
family
and
household
,
except
old
Josyna
,
who
was
left
in
charge
of
the
house
,
repaired
to
the
neighbouring
church
of
Saint
Alban
's
,
but
,
finding
the
doors
closed
,
and
that
no
service
was
to
be
performed
,
he
returned
home
with
a
sorrowful
heart
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
Leonard
took
Mr.
Bloundel
apart
,
and
observed
to
him
,
"
I
have
a
strong
conviction
that
I
could
be
useful
in
arresting
the
progress
of
the
conflagration
,
and
,
as
I
can
not
attend
church
service
,
I
will
,
with
your
permission
,
devote
myself
to
that
object
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
intention
to
proceed
to
Whitehall
,
and
,
if
possible
,
obtain
an
audience
of
the
king
,
and
if
I
succeed
in
doing
so
,
to
lay
a
plan
before
him
,
which
I
think
would
prove
efficacious
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
ask
what
the
plan
is
,
"
rejoined
the
grocer
,
"
because
I
doubt
its
success
.
<EOS>
Neither
will
I
oppose
your
design
,
which
is
praiseworthy
.
<EOS>
Go
,
and
may
it
prosper
.
<EOS>
Return
in
the
evening
,
for
I
may
need
your
assistance
--
perhaps
protection
.
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
then
prepared
to
set
forth
.
<EOS>
Blaize
begged
hard
to
accompany
him
,
but
was
refused
.
<EOS>
Forcing
his
way
through
the
host
of
carts
,
coaches
,
drays
,
and
other
vehicles
thronging
the
streets
,
Leonard
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
Whitehall
,
where
he
speedily
arrived
.
<EOS>
A
large
body
of
mounted
troopers
were
stationed
before
the
gates
of
the
palace
,
and
a
regiment
of
the
foot
-
guards
were
drawn
up
in
the
court
.
<EOS>
Drums
were
beating
to
arms
,
and
other
martial
sounds
were
heard
,
showing
the
alarm
that
was
felt
.
<EOS>
Leonard
was
stopped
at
the
gate
by
a
sentinel
,
and
refused
admittance
;
and
he
would
in
all
probability
have
been
turned
back
,
if
at
that
moment
the
Lords
Argentine
and
Rochester
had
not
come
up
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
him
,
the
former
frowned
,
and
passed
quickly
on
,
but
the
latter
halted
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
be
in
some
difficulty
,
"
remarked
Rochester
.
"
<EOS>
Can
I
help
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
Leonard
was
about
to
turn
away
,
but
he
checked
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
suffer
my
resentful
feelings
to
operate
injuriously
to
others
,
"
he
muttered
.
<EOS>
"
I
desire
to
see
the
king
,
my
lord
,
"
he
added
,
to
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
proposal
to
make
to
him
,
which
I
think
would
be
a
means
of
checking
the
conflagration
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Say
you
so
?
"
cried
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
Come
along
,
then
.
<EOS>
Heaven
grant
your
plan
may
prove
successful
;
in
which
case
,
I
promise
you
,
you
shall
be
nobly
rewarded
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
seek
no
reward
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
All
I
desire
is
to
save
the
city
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
rejoined
Rochester
,
"
it
will
be
time
enough
to
refuse
his
majesty
's
bounty
when
offered
.
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
he
ordered
the
sentinel
to
withdraw
,
and
Leonard
followed
him
into
the
palace
.
<EOS>
They
found
the
entrance
-
hall
filled
with
groups
of
officers
and
attendants
,
all
conversing
together
,
it
was
evident
from
their
looks
and
manner
,
on
the
one
engrossing
topic
--
the
conflagration
.
<EOS>
Ascending
a
magnificent
staircase
,
and
traversing
part
of
a
grand
gallery
,
they
entered
an
ante
-
room
,
in
which
a
number
of
courtiers
and
.
<EOS>
pages
--
amongst
the
latter
of
whom
was
Chiffinch
--
were
assembled
.
<EOS>
At
the
door
of
the
inner
chamber
stood
a
couple
of
ushers
,
and
as
the
earl
approached
,
it
was
instantly
thrown
open
.
<EOS>
As
Leonard
,
however
,
who
followed
close
behind
his
leader
,
passed
Chiffinch
,
the
latter
caught
hold
of
his
arm
and
detained
him
.
<EOS>
Hearing
the
movement
,
Rochester
turned
,
and
said
quickly
to
the
page
,
"
Let
him
pass
,
he
is
going
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Old
Rowley
is
in
no
humour
for
a
jest
to
-
day
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Chiffinch
,
familiarly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
more
serious
than
I
have
ever
before
seen
him
,
and
takes
this
terrible
fire
sadly
to
heart
,
as
well
he
may
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
Pepys
,
of
the
Admiralty
,
is
with
him
,
and
is
detailing
all
particulars
of
the
calamity
to
him
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
in
reference
to
the
fire
that
I
have
brought
this
young
man
with
me
,
"
returned
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
him
pass
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
State
your
plan
boldly
,
"
he
added
,
as
they
entered
the
audience
-
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
further
end
of
the
long
apartment
,
on
a
chair
of
state
,
and
beneath
a
canopy
,
sat
Charles
.
<EOS>
He
was
evidently
much
disturbed
,
and
looked
eagerly
at
the
new
-
comers
,
especially
at
Leonard
,
expecting
to
find
him
the
bearer
of
some
important
intelligence
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
of
the
king
,
and
near
an
open
window
,
which
,
looking
towards
the
river
,
commanded
a
view
of
the
fire
on
the
bridge
,
as
well
as
of
part
of
the
burning
city
,
stood
the
Duke
of
York
.
<EOS>
The
duke
did
not
appear
much
concerned
at
the
calamity
,
but
was
laughing
with
Lord
Argentine
,
who
stood
close
beside
him
.
<EOS>
The
smile
fled
from
the
lips
of
the
latter
as
he
beheld
Leonard
,
and
he
looked
angrily
at
Rochester
,
who
did
not
,
however
,
appear
to
notice
his
displeasure
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
of
the
royal
chair
was
Mr.
Pepys
,
engaged
,
as
Chiffinch
had
intimated
,
in
detailing
to
the
king
the
progress
of
the
conflagration
;
and
next
to
the
secretary
stood
the
Earl
of
Craven,--a
handsome
,
commanding
,
and
martial
-
looking
personage
,
though
somewhat
stricken
in
years
.
<EOS>
Three
other
noblemen--
namely
,
the
Lords
Hollis
,
Arlington
,
and
Ashley
--
were
likewise
present
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
have
you
with
you
,
Rochester
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Charles
,
as
the
earl
and
his
companion
approached
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
young
man
,
my
liege
,
who
desires
to
make
known
to
you
a
plan
for
checking
this
conflagration
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
the
king
;
"
let
him
accomplish
that
for
us
,
and
he
shall
ask
what
he
will
in
return
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
ventured
to
promise
him
as
much
,
"
observed
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mine
is
a
very
simple
and
a
very
obvious
plan
,
sire
,
"
said
Leonard
;
"
but
I
will
engage
,
on
the
peril
of
my
life
,
if
you
will
give
me
sufficient
authority
,
and
means
to
work
withal
,
to
stop
the
further
progress
of
this
fire
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
what
way
?
"
asked
Charles
,
impatiently;--"in
what
way
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
demolishing
the
houses
around
the
conflagration
with
gunpowder
,
so
as
to
form
a
wide
gap
between
those
left
and
the
flames
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
short
and
summary
process
,
truly
,
"
replied
the
king
;
"
but
it
would
occasion
great
waste
of
property
,
and
might
be
attended
with
other
serious
consequences
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
half
so
much
property
will
be
destroyed
as
if
the
slower
and
seemingly
safer
course
of
pulling
down
the
houses
is
pursued
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
That
experiment
has
been
tried
and
failed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
of
the
young
man
's
opinion
,
"
observed
the
Earl
of
Craven
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
,
"
added
Pepys
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Better
lose
half
the
city
than
the
whole
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
your
majesty
is
not
safe
in
your
palace
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
do
not
think
it
can
reach
Whitehall
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
king
,
rising
,
and
walking
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
say
you
,
brother
,
"
he
added
,
to
the
Duke
of
York--"shall
we
act
upon
this
young
man
's
suggestion
,
and
order
the
wholesale
demolition
of
the
houses
which
he
recommends
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
advise
your
majesty
to
do
so
--
at
least
,
not
without
consideration
,
"
answered
the
duke
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
terrible
fire
,
no
doubt
;
but
the
danger
may
be
greatly
exaggerated
,
and
if
any
ill
consequences
should
result
from
the
proposed
scheme
,
the
blame
will
be
entirely
laid
upon
your
majesty
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
care
not
for
that
,
"
replied
the
king
,
"
provided
I
feel
assured
it
is
for
the
best
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
plan
would
do
incalculably
more
mischief
than
the
fire
itself
,
"
observed
Lord
Argentine
,
"
and
would
be
met
by
the
most
determined
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
owners
of
the
habitations
condemned
to
destruction
.
<EOS>
Whole
streets
will
have
to
be
blown
up
,
and
your
majesty
will
easily
comprehend
the
confusion
and
damage
that
will
ensue
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Lord
Argentine
has
expressed
my
sentiments
exactly
,
"
said
the
Duke
of
York
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
for
it
,
then
,
but
for
your
majesty
to
call
for
a
fiddle
,
and
amuse
yourself
,
like
Nero
,
while
your
city
is
burning
,
"
remarked
Rochester
,
sarcastically
.
 
<EOS>
"
Another
such
jest
,
my
lord
,
"
rejoined
the
king
,
sternly
,
"
and
it
shall
cost
you
your
liberty
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
upon
the
river
instantly
,
and
view
the
fire
myself
,
and
then
decide
what
course
shall
be
adopted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
are
rumours
that
incendiaries
are
abroad
,
your
majesty
,
"
remarked
Argentine
,
glancing
maliciously
at
Leonard--"it
is
not
unlikely
that
he
who
lighted
the
fire
should
know
how
to
extinguish
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
lordship
says
truly
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
There
_
are
_
incendiaries
abroad
,
and
the
chief
of
them
was
taken
by
my
hand
,
and
lodged
in
Newgate
,
where
he
lies
for
examination
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
the
king
,
eagerly
;
"
did
you
catch
the
miscreant
in
the
fact
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
"
but
he
came
to
me
a
few
hours
before
the
outbreak
of
the
fire
,
intimating
that
he
was
in
possession
of
a
plot
against
the
city
--
a
design
so
monstrous
,
that
your
majesty
would
give
any
reward
to
the
discloser
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
proposed
to
reveal
this
plot
to
me
on
certain
terms
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
accepted
them
?
"
cried
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
"
I
refused
them
,
and
would
have
secured
him
,
but
he
escaped
me
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
I
afterwards
discovered
him
among
the
spectators
near
the
fire
,
and
caused
his
arrest
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
who
is
this
villain
?
"
cried
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
refer
your
majesty
to
Lord
Argentine
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
anything
of
the
transaction
,
my
lord
?
"
said
Charles
,
appealing
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
I
,
your
majesty
,
"
said
Argentine
,
vainly
endeavouring
to
conceal
his
anger
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
"
The
knave
has
spoken
falsely
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
shall
rue
it
,
if
he
has
done
so
,
"
rejoined
the
monarch
.
<EOS>
"
What
has
the
man
you
speak
of
to
do
with
Lord
Argentine
?
"
he
added
to
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
his
father
,
"
was
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
looked
at
Lord
Argentine
,
and
became
convinced
from
the
altered
expression
of
his
countenance
that
the
truth
had
been
spoken
.
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
arose
,
and
motioning
him
to
follow
him
,
led
him
into
the
recess
of
a
window
,
where
they
remained
in
conversation
for
some
minutes
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
passing
,
the
Earl
of
Rochester
observed
,
in
an
undertone
to
Leonard
,
"
You
have
made
a
mortal
foe
of
Lord
Argentine
,
but
I
will
protect
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
require
no
other
protection
than
I
can
afford
myself
,
my
lord
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
,
coldly
.
 
<EOS>
Shortly
after
this
,
Charles
stepped
forward
with
a
graver
aspect
than
before
,
and
said
,
"
Before
proceeding
to
view
this
conflagration
,
I
must
give
some
directions
in
reference
to
it
.
<EOS>
To
you
,
my
Lord
Craven
,
whose
intrepidity
I
well
know
,
I
intrust
the
most
important
post
.
<EOS>
You
will
station
yourself
at
the
east
of
the
conflagration
,
and
if
you
find
it
making
its
way
to
the
Tower
,
as
I
hear
is
the
case
,
check
it
at
all
hazards
.
<EOS>
The
old
fortress
must
be
preserved
at
any
risk
.
<EOS>
But
do
not
resort
to
gunpowder
unless
you
receive
an
order
from
me
accompanied
by
my
signet
-
ring
.
<EOS>
My
Lords
Hollis
and
Ashley
,
you
will
have
the
care
of
the
north
-
west
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
Station
yourselves
near
Newgate
Market
.
<EOS>
Rochester
and
Arlington
,
your
posts
will
be
at
Saint
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
Watch
over
the
august
cathedral
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
it
injured
for
half
my
kingdom
.
<EOS>
Brother
,
"
he
added
to
the
Duke
of
York
,
"
you
will
accompany
me
in
my
barge
--
and
you
,
Mr.
Pepys
.
<EOS>
You
,
young
man
,
"
to
Leonard
,
"
can
follow
in
my
train
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Has
your
majesty
no
post
for
me
?
"
asked
Argentine
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Charles
,
turning
coldly
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Had
not
your
majesty
better
let
him
have
the
custody
of
your
gaol
of
Newgate
?
"
remarked
Rochester
,
sarcastically
;
"
he
has
an
interest
in
its
safe
keeping
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Lord
Argentine
turned
deadly
pale
,
but
he
made
no
answer
.
<EOS>
Attended
by
the
Duke
of
York
and
Mr.
Pepys
,
and
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
by
Leonard
,
the
king
then
passed
through
the
ante
-
room
,
and
descending
the
grand
staircase
,
traversed
a
variety
of
passages
,
until
he
reached
the
private
stairs
communicating
with
the
river
.
<EOS>
At
the
foot
lay
the
royal
barge
,
in
which
he
embarked
with
his
train
.
<EOS>
Charles
appeared
greatly
moved
by
the
sight
of
the
thousands
of
his
houseless
subjects
,
whom
he
encountered
in
his
passage
down
the
Thames
,
and
whenever
a
feeble
shout
was
raised
for
him
,
he
returned
it
with
a
blessing
.
<EOS>
When
nearly
opposite
Queenhithe
,
he
commanded
the
rowers
to
pause
.
<EOS>
The
conflagration
had
made
formidable
progress
since
Leonard
'
beheld
it
a
few
hours
back
,
and
had
advanced
,
nearly
as
far
as
the
Still
-
yard
on
the
river
-
side
,
while
it
was
burning
upwards
through
thick
ranks
of
houses
,
almost
as
far
as
Cannon
-
street
.
<EOS>
The
roaring
of
the
flames
was
louder
than
ever
--
and
the
crash
of
falling
habitations
,
and
the
tumult
and
cries
of
the
affrighted
populace
,
yet
more
terrific
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
gazed
at
the
appalling
spectacle
like
one
who
could
not
believe
his
senses
,
and
it
was
some
time
before
the
overwhelming
truth
could
force
itself
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Tears
then
started
to
his
eyes
,
and
,
uttering
an
ejaculation
of
despair
,
he
commanded
the
rowers
to
make
instantly
for
the
shore
.

HOW
LEONARD
SAVED
THE
KING
'S
LIFE
.
 
<EOS>
The
royal
barge
landed
at
Queenhithe
,
and
Charles
instantly
disembarking
,
proceeded
on
foot
,
and
at
a
pace
that
compelled
,
his
attendants
to
move
quickly
,
to
keep
up
with
him
,
to
Thames
-
street
.
<EOS>
Here
,
however
,
the
confusion
was
so
great
,
owing
to
the
rush
of
people
,
and
the
number
of
vehicles
employed
in
the
removal
of
goods
,
that
he
was
obliged
to
come
to
a
halt
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
at
this
moment
,
a
company
of
the
train
-
bands
rode
up
,
and
their
leader
dismounting
,
offered
his
horse
to
the
king
,
who
instantly
sprang
into
the
saddle
,
and
scarcely
waiting
till
the
Duke
of
York
could
be
similarly
accommodated
,
forced
his
way
through
the
crowd
as
far
as
Brewer
-
lane
,
where
his
progress
was
stopped
by
the
intense
heat
.
<EOS>
A
little
more
than
a
hundred
yards
from
this
point
,
the
whole
street
was
on
fire
,
and
the
flames
bursting
from
the
windows
and
roofs
of
the
houses
,
with
a
roar
like
that
which
might
be
supposed
to
be
produced
by
the
forges
of
the
Cyclops
,
united
in
a
vast
blazing
arch
overhead
.
<EOS>
It
chanced
,
too
,
that
in
some
places
cellars
filled
with
combustible
materials
extended
under
the
street
,
and
here
the
ground
would
crack
,
and
jets
of
fire
shoot
forth
like
the
eruption
of
a
volcano
.
<EOS>
The
walls
and
timbers
of
the
houses
at
some
distance
from
the
conflagration
were
scorched
and
blistered
with
the
heat
,
and
completely
prepared
for
ignition
;
overhead
being
a
vast
and
momentarily
increasing
cloud
of
flame
-
coloured
smoke
,
which
spread
all
over
the
city
,
filling
it
as
with
a
thick
mist
,
while
the
glowing
vault
above
looked
,
as
Evelyn
expresses
it
,
"
like
the
top
of
a
burning
oven
.
"
 
<EOS>
Two
churches
,
namely
,
Allhallows
the
Great
and
Allhallows
the
Less
,
were
burnt
down
in
the
king
's
sight
,
and
the
lofty
spire
of
a
third
,
Saint
Lawrence
Poulteney
,
had
just
caught
fire
,
and
looked
like
a
flame
-
tipped
spear
.
<EOS>
After
contemplating
this
spectacle
for
some
time
,
Charles
roused
himself
from
the
state
of
stupefaction
into
which
he
was
thrown
,
and
determined
,
if
possible
,
to
arrest
the
further
progress
of
the
devouring
element
along
the
river
-
side
,
commanded
all
the
houses
on
the
west
of
Dowgate
Dock
to
be
instantly
demolished
.
<EOS>
A
large
body
of
men
were
therefore
set
upon
this
difficult
and
dangerous
,
and
,
as
it
proved
,
futile
task
.
<EOS>
Another
party
were
ordered
to
the
same
duty
on
Dowgate
-
hill
;
and
the
crash
of
tumbling
walls
and
beams
was
soon
added
to
the
general
uproar
,
while
clouds
of
dust
darkened
the
air
.
<EOS>
It
was
with
some
difficulty
that
a
sufficient
space
could
be
kept
clear
for
carrying
these
operations
into
effect
;
and
long
before
they
were
half
-
completed
,
Charles
had
the
mortification
of
finding
the
fire
gaining
ground
so
rapidly
,
that
they
must
prove
ineffectual
.
<EOS>
Word
was
brought
at
this
juncture
that
a
fresh
fire
had
broken
out
in
Elbow
-
lane
,
and
while
the
monarch
was
listening
to
this
dreary
intelligence
,
a
fearful
cry
was
heard
near
the
river
,
followed
,
the
next
moment
,
by
a
tumultuous
rush
of
persons
from
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
The
fire
,
as
if
in
scorn
,
had
leapt
across
Dowgate
Dock
,
and
seizing
upon
the
half
-
demolished
houses
,
instantly
made
them
its
prey
.
<EOS>
The
rapidity
with
which
the
conflagration
proceeded
was
astounding
,
and
completely
baffled
all
attempts
to
check
it
.
<EOS>
The
wind
continued
blowing
as
furiously
as
ever
,
nor
was
there
the
slightest
prospect
of
its
abatement
.
<EOS>
All
the
king
's
better
qualities
were
called
into
play
by
the
present
terrible
crisis
.
<EOS>
With
a
courage
and
devotion
that
he
seldom
displayed
,
he
exposed
himself
to
the
greatest
risk
,
personally
assisting
at
all
the
operations
he
commanded
;
while
his
humane
attention
to
the
sufferers
by
the
calamity
almost
reconciled
them
to
their
deplorable
situation
.
<EOS>
His
movements
were
almost
as
rapid
as
those
of
the
fire
itself
.
<EOS>
Riding
up
Cannon
-
street
,
and
from
thence
by
Sweeting's
-
lane
,
to
Lombard
-
street
,
and
so
on
by
Fenchurch
-
street
to
Tower
-
street
,
he
issued
directions
all
the
way
,
checking
every
disturbance
,
and
causing
a
band
of
depredators
,
who
had
broken
into
the
house
of
a
wealthy
goldsmith
,
to
be
carried
off
to
Newgate
.
<EOS>
Arrived
in
Tower
-
street
,
he
found
the
Earl
of
Craven
and
his
party
stationed
a
little
beyond
Saint
Dunstan
's
in
the
East
.
 
<EOS>
All
immediate
apprehensions
in
this
quarter
appeared
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
The
church
had
been
destroyed
,
as
before
mentioned
,
but
several
houses
in
its
vicinity
having
been
demolished
,
the
fire
had
not
extended
eastward
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
that
the
Tower
was
in
no
immediate
danger
,
the
king
retraced
his
course
,
and
encountering
the
lord
mayor
in
Lombard
-
street
,
sharply
reproved
him
for
his
want
of
zeal
and
discretion
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
deserve
your
majesty
's
reproaches
,
"
replied
the
lord
mayor
.
<EOS>
"
Ever
since
the
fire
broke
out
I
have
not
rested
an
instant
,
and
am
almost
worn
to
death
with
anxiety
and
fatigue
.
<EOS>
I
am
just
returned
from
Guildhall
,
where
a
vast
quantity
of
plate
belonging
to
the
city
companies
has
been
deposited
.
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
what
a
fire
this
is
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
chiefly
to
blame
for
its
getting
so
much
ahead
,
"
replied
the
king
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Had
you
adopted
vigorous
measures
at
the
outset
,
it
might
have
easily
been
got
under
.
<EOS>
I
hear
no
water
was
to
be
obtained
.
<EOS>
How
was
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
damnable
plot
,
your
majesty
,
designed
by
the
Papists
,
or
the
Dutch
,
or
the
French
--
I
do
n't
know
<EOS>
which
--
perhaps
all
three
,
"
rejoined
the
lord
mayor
;
"
and
it
appears
that
the
cocks
of
all
the
pipes
at
the
waterworks
at
Islington
were
turned
,
while
the
pipes
and
conduits
in
the
city
were
empty
.
<EOS>
This
is
no
accidental
fire
,
your
majesty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
find
,
"
replied
the
king
;
"
but
it
will
be
time
enough
to
inquire
into
its
origin
hereafter
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
we
must
act
,
and
energetically
,
or
we
shall
be
equally
as
much
to
blame
as
the
incendiaries
.
<EOS>
Let
a
proclamation
be
made
,
enjoining
all
those
persons
who
have
been
driven
from
their
homes
by
the
fire
to
proceed
,
with
such
effects
as
they
have
preserved
,
to
Moorfields
,
where
their
wants
shall
be
cared
for
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
made
instantly
,
your
majesty
,
"
replied
the
lord
mayor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
next
business
will
be
to
see
to
the
removal
of
all
the
wealth
from
the
goldsmiths
'
houses
in
this
street
,
and
in
Gracechurch
-
street
,
to
some
places
of
security
,
Guildhall
,
or
the
Royal
Exchange
,
for
instance
,
"
continued
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
majesty
's
directions
shall
be
implicitly
obeyed
,
"
replied
the
lord
mayor
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
then
pull
down
all
the
houses
to
the
east
of
the
fire
,
"
pursued
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
Get
all
the
men
you
can
muster
;
and
never
relax
your
exertions
till
you
have
made
a
wide
and
clear
breach
between
the
flames
and
their
prey
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
--
<EOS>
I
will
,
your
majesty
,
"
groaned
the
lord
mayor
.
 
<EOS>
"
About
it
,
then
,
"
rejoined
the
king
;
and
striking
spurs
into
his
horse
,
he
rode
off
with
his
train
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
penetrated
one
of
the
narrow
alleys
leading
to
the
Three
Cranes
in
the
Vintry
,
where
he
ascended
to
the
roof
of
the
habitation
,
that
he
might
view
the
fire
.
<EOS>
He
saw
that
it
was
making
such
rapid
advances
towards
him
,
that
it
must
very
soon
reach
the
building
on
which
he
stood
,
and
,
half
suffocated
with
the
smoke
,
and
scorched
with
the
fire
-
drops
,
he
descended
.
 
<EOS>
Not
long
after
this
,
Waterman
's
Hall
was
discovered
to
be
on
fire
;
and
,
stirred
by
the
sight
,
Charles
made
fresh
efforts
to
check
the
progress
of
the
conflagration
by
demolishing
more
houses
.
<EOS>
So
eagerly
did
he
occupy
himself
in
the
task
,
that
his
life
had
well
-
nigh
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
his
zeal
.
<EOS>
He
was
standing
below
a
building
which
the
workmen
were
unroofing
,
when
all
at
once
the
whole
of
the
upper
part
of
the
wall
gave
way
,
dragging
several
heavy
beams
with
it
,
and
would
have
infallibly
crushed
him
,
if
Leonard
,
who
was
stationed
behind
him
,
had
not
noticed
the
circumstance
,
and
rushing
forward
with
the
greatest
promptitude
,
dragged
him
out
of
harm
's
way
.
<EOS>
An
engineer
,
with
whom
the
king
was
conversing
at
the
time
of
the
accident
,
was
buried
in
the
ruins
,
and
when
taken
out
was
found
fearfully
mutilated
and
quite
dead
.
<EOS>
Both
Charles
and
his
preserver
were
covered
with
dust
and
rubbish
,
and
Leonard
received
a
severe
blow
on
the
shoulder
from
a
falling
brick
.
 
<EOS>
On
recovering
from
the
shock
,
which
for
some
moments
deprived
him
of
the
power
of
speech
,
Charles
inquired
for
his
deliverer
,
and
,
on
being
shown
him
,
said
,
with
a
look
of
surprise
and
pleasure
,
"
What
,
is
it
you
,
young
man
?
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
Depend
,
upon
it
,
I
shall
not
forget
the
important
service
you
have
rendered
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
remembers
it
,
it
will
be
the
first
time
he
has
ever
so
exercised
his
memory
,
"
observed
Chiffinch
,
in
a
loud
whisper
to
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
advise
you
,
as
a
friend
,
not
to
let
his
gratitude
cool
.
"
 
<EOS>
Undeterred
by
this
late
narrow
escape
,
Charles
ordered
fresh
houses
to
be
demolished
,
and
stimulated
the
workmen
to
exertion
by
his
personal
superintendence
of
their
operations
.
<EOS>
He
commanded
Leonard
to
keep
constantly
near
him
,
laughingly
observing
,
"
I
shall
feel
safe
while
you
are
by
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
better
eye
for
a
falling
house
than
any
of
my
attendants
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Worn
out
at
length
with
fatigue
,
Charles
proceeded
,
with
the
Duke
of
York
and
his
immediate
attendants
,
to
Painters
'
Hall
,
in
little
Trinity
-
lane
,
in
quest
of
refreshment
,
where
a
repast
was
hastily
prepared
for
him
,
and
he
sat
down
to
it
with
an
appetite
such
as
the
most
magnificent
banquet
could
not
,
under
other
circumstances
,
have
provoked
.
<EOS>
His
hunger
satisfied
,
he
despatched
messengers
to
command
the
immediate
attendance
of
the
lord
mayor
,
the
sheriffs
,
and
aldermen
;
and
when
they
arrived
,
he
thus
addressed
them:--"My
lord
mayor
and
gentlemen
<EOS>
,
it
has
been
recommended
to
me
by
this
young
man
,
"
pointing
to
Leonard
,
"
that
the
sole
way
of
checking
the
further
progress
of
this
disastrous
conflagration
,
which
threatens
the
total
destruction
of
our
city
,
will
be
by
blowing
up
the
houses
with
gunpowder
,
so
as
to
form
a
wide
gap
between
the
flames
and
the
habitations
yet
remaining
unseized
.
<EOS>
This
plan
will
necessarily
involve
great
destruction
of
property
,
and
may
,
notwithstanding
all
the
care
that
can
be
adopted
,
be
attended
with
some
loss
of
life
;
but
I
conceive
it
will
be
effectual
.
<EOS>
Before
ordering
it
,
however
,
to
be
put
into
execution
,
I
desire
to
learn
your
opinion
of
it
.
<EOS>
How
say
you
,
my
lord
mayor
and
gentlemen
?
<EOS>
Does
the
plan
meet
with
your
approbation
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
pray
your
majesty
to
allow
me
to
confer
for
a
moment
with
my
brethren
,
"
replied
the
lord
mayor
,
cautiously
,
"
before
I
return
an
answer
.
<EOS>
It
is
too
serious
a
matter
to
decide
upon
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
it
so
,
"
replied
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
civic
authorities
withdrew
with
the
king
.
<EOS>
Leonard
heard
,
though
he
did
not
dare
to
remark
upon
it
,
that
the
Duke
of
York
leaned
forward
as
the
lord
mayor
passed
him
,
and
whispered
in
his
ear
,
"
Take
heed
what
you
do
.
<EOS>
He
only
desires
to
shift
the
responsibility
of
the
act
from
his
own
shoulders
to
yours
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
they
assent
,
"
said
the
king
to
Leonard
,
"
I
will
place
you
at
the
head
of
a
party
of
engineers
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
beseech
your
majesty
neither
to
regard
me
nor
them
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Use
the
authority
it
has
pleased
Heaven
to
bestow
upon
you
for
the
preservation
of
the
city
,
and
think
and
act
for
yourself
,
or
you
will
assuredly
regret
your
want
of
decision
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
my
fortune
,
with
the
assistance
of
God
,
to
be
the
humble
instrument
of
accomplishing
your
majesty
's
deliverance
from
peril
,
and
I
have
your
royal
word
that
you
will
not
forget
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
will
I
,
"
cried
the
king
,
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
suffer
the
petition
I
now
make
to
you
to
prevail
,
"
cried
Leonard
,
falling
on
his
knees
.
<EOS>
"
Be
not
influenced
by
the
opinion
of
the
lord
mayor
and
his
brethren
,
<EOS>
whose
own
interests
may
lead
them
to
oppose
the
plan
;
but
,
if
you
think
well
of
it
,
instantly
adopt
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Charles
looked
irresolute
,
but
might
have
yielded
,
if
the
Duke
of
York
had
not
stepped
forward
.
"
<EOS>
Your
majesty
had
better
not
act
too
precipitately
,
"
said
the
duke
.
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
the
counsels
of
your
prudent
advisers
.
<EOS>
A
false
step
in
such
a
case
will
be
irretrievable
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
brother
,
"
rejoined
the
king
,
"
I
see
no
particular
risk
in
it
,
after
all
,
and
I
incline
towards
the
young
man
's
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
hear
what
they
have
got
to
say
,
"
rejoined
the
duke
.
"
<EOS>
And
here
they
come
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
been
long
in
deliberation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
result
of
it
may
be
easily
predicted
,
"
said
Leonard
,
rising
.
 
<EOS>
As
Leonard
had
foreseen
,
the
civic
authorities
were
adverse
to
the
plan
.
<EOS>
The
lord
mayor
in
the
name
of
himself
and
his
brethren
,
earnestly
solicited
the
king
to
postpone
the
execution
of
his
order
till
all
other
means
of
checking
the
progress
of
the
conflagration
had
been
tried
,
and
till
such
time
,
at
least
,
as
the
property
of
the
owners
of
the
houses
to
be
destroyed
could
be
removed
.
<EOS>
He
further
added
,
that
it
was
the
unanimous
opinion
of
himself
and
his
brethren
,
that
the
plan
was
fraught
with
great
peril
to
the
safety
of
the
citizens
,
and
that
they
could
not
bring
themselves
to
assent
to
it
.
<EOS>
If
,
therefore
,
his
majesty
chose
to
adopt
it
,
they
must
leave
the
responsibility
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
your
majesty
how
it
would
be
,
"
observed
the
Duke
of
York
,
triumphantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
find
you
are
right
,
brother
,
"
replied
the
king
,
frowning
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
overruled
,
you
see
,
friend
,
"
he
added
to
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
majesty
has
signed
the
doom
of
your
city
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
,
mournfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
not
--
I
trust
not
,
"
replied
Charles
,
hastily
,
and
with
an
uneasy
shrug
of
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
Fail
not
to
remind
me
when
all
is
over
of
the
obligation
I
am
under
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
majesty
has
refused
the
sole
boon
I
desired
to
have
granted
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
not
see
the
reason
,
friend
?
"
returned
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
These
worthy
and
wealthy
citizens
desire
to
remove
their
property
.
<EOS>
Their
arguments
are
unanswerable
.
<EOS>
I
_
must
_
give
them
time
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
But
we
waste
time
here
,
"
he
added
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"
Remember
,
"
to
Leonard
,
"
my
debt
is
not
discharged
.
<EOS>
And
I
command
you
,
on
pain
of
my
sovereign
displeasure
,
not
to
omit
to
claim
its
payment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
enter
it
in
my
memorandum
-
book
,
and
will
put
your
majesty
in
mind
of
it
at
the
fitting
season
,
"
observed
Chiffinch
,
who
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
The
king
smiled
good
-
humouredly
,
and
quitting
the
hall
with
his
attendants
,
proceeded
to
superintend
the
further
demolition
of
houses
.
<EOS>
He
next
visited
all
the
posts
,
saw
that
the
different
noblemen
were
at
their
appointed
stations
,
and
by
his
unremitting
exertions
,
contrived
to
restore
something
like
order
to
the
tumultuous
streets
.
<EOS>
Thousands
of
men
were
now
employed
in
different
quarters
in
pulling
down
houses
,
and
the
most
powerful
engines
of
war
were
employed
in
the
work
.
<EOS>
The
confusion
that
attended
these
proceedings
is
indescribable
.
<EOS>
The
engineers
and
workmen
wrought
in
clouds
of
dust
and
smoke
,
and
the
crash
of
falling
timber
and
walls
was
deafening
.
<EOS>
In
a
short
time
,
the
upper
part
of
Cornhill
was
rendered
wholly
impassable
,
owing
to
the
heaps
of
rubbish
;
and
directions
were
given
to
the
engineers
to
proceed
to
the
Poultry
,
and
demolish
the
houses
as
far
as
the
Conduit
in
Cheapside
,
by
which
means
it
was
hoped
that
the
Royal
Exchange
would
be
saved
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
all
the
wealthy
goldsmiths
and
merchants
in
Lombard
-
street
and
Gracechurch
-
street
had
been
actively
employed
in
removing
all
their
money
,
plate
,
and
goods
,
to
places
of
security
.
<EOS>
A
vast
quantity
was
conveyed
to
Guildhall
,
as
has
been
stated
,
and
the
rest
to
different
churches
and
halls
remote
from
the
scene
of
conflagration
.
<EOS>
But
in
spite
of
all
their
caution
,
much
property
was
carried
off
by
the
depredators
,
and
amongst
others
by
Chowles
and
Judith
,
who
contrived
to
secure
a
mass
of
plate
,
gold
,
and
jewels
,
that
satisfied
even
their
rapacious
souls
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
passing
in
the
heart
of
the
burning
city
,
vast
crowds
were
streaming
out
of
its
gates
,
and
encamping
themselves
,
in
pursuance
of
the
royal
injunction
,
in
Finsbury
Fields
and
Spitalfields
.
<EOS>
Others
crossed
the
water
to
Southwark
,
and
took
refuge
in
Saint
George
's
Fields
;
and
it
was
a
sad
and
touching
sight
to
see
all
these
families
collected
without
shelter
or
food
,
most
of
whom
a
few
hours
before
were
in
possession
of
all
the
comforts
of
life
,
but
were
now
reduced
to
the
condition
of
beggars
.
 
<EOS>
To
return
to
the
conflagration:--While
one
party
continued
to
labour
incessantly
at
the
work
of
demolition
,
and
ineffectually
sought
to
quench
the
flames
,
by
bringing
a
few
engines
to
play
upon
them,--a
scanty
supply
of
water
having
now
been
obtained
--
the
fire
,
disdaining
such
puny
opposition
,
and
determined
to
show
its
giant
strength
,
leaped
over
all
the
breaches
,
drove
the
water
-
carriers
back
,
compelled
them
to
relinquish
their
buckets
,
and
to
abandon
their
engines
,
which
it
made
its
prey
,
and
seizing
upon
the
heaps
of
timber
and
other
fragments
occasioned
by
the
demolition
,
consumed
them
,
and
marched
onwards
with
furious
exultation
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
proceeding
up
Gracechurch
-
street
,
Saint
Clement's
-
lane
,
Nicholas
-
lane
,
and
Abchurch
-
lane
at
the
same
time
,
destroying
all
in
its
course
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
Lombard
-
street
was
choked
up
with
the
ruins
and
rubbish
of
demolished
houses
,
through
which
thousands
of
persons
were
toiling
to
carry
off
goods
,
either
for
the
purpose
of
assistance
or
of
plunder
.
<EOS>
The
king
was
at
the
west
end
of
the
street
,
near
the
church
of
Saint
Mary
Woolnoth
,
and
the
fearful
havoc
and
destruction
going
forward
drew
tears
from
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
A
scene
of
greater
confusion
can
not
be
imagined
.
<EOS>
Leonard
was
in
the
midst
of
it
,
and
,
careless
of
his
own
safety
,
toiled
amid
the
tumbling
fragments
of
the
houses
to
rescue
some
article
of
value
for
its
unfortunate
owner
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
thus
employed
,
he
observed
a
man
leap
out
of
a
window
of
a
partly
demolished
house
,
disclosing
in
the
action
that
he
had
a
casket
concealed
under
his
cloak
.
 
<EOS>
A
second
glance
showed
him
that
this
individual
was
Pillichody
,
and
satisfied
that
he
had
been
plundering
the
house
,
he
instantly
seized
him
.
<EOS>
The
bully
struggled
violently
,
but
at
last
,
dropping
the
casket
,
made
his
escape
,
vowing
to
be
revenged
.
<EOS>
Leonard
laughed
at
his
threats
,
and
the
next
moment
had
the
satisfaction
of
restoring
the
casket
to
its
rightful
owner
,
an
old
merchant
,
who
issued
from
the
house
,
and
who
,
after
thanking
him
,
told
him
it
contained
jewels
of
immense
value
.
 
<EOS>
Not
half
an
hour
after
this
,
the
flames
poured
upon
Lombard
-
street
from
the
four
avenues
before
mentioned
,
and
the
whole
neighbourhood
was
on
fire
.
<EOS>
With
inconceivable
rapidity
,
they
then
ran
up
Birchin
-
lane
,
and
reaching
Cornhill
,
spread
to
the
right
and
left
in
that
great
thoroughfare
.
<EOS>
The
conflagration
had
now
reached
the
highest
point
of
the
city
,
and
presented
the
grandest
and
most
terrific
aspect
it
had
yet
assumed
from
the
river
.
<EOS>
Thus
viewed
,
it
appeared
,
as
Pepys
describes
it
,
"
as
an
entire
arch
of
fire
from
the
Three
Cranes
to
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
,
and
in
a
bow
up
the
hill
,
for
an
arch
of
above
a
mile
long
:
_
it
made
me
weep
to
see
it
_
.
"
<EOS>
Vincent
also
likens
its
appearance
at
this
juncture
to
that
of
a
bow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
dreadful
bow
<EOS>
it
was
,
"
writes
this
eloquent
nonconformist
preacher
,
"
such
as
mine
eyes
have
never
before
seen
;
a
bow
which
had
God
's
arrow
in
it
with
a
flaming
point
;
a
shining
bow
,
not
like
that
in
the
cloud
which
brings
water
with
it
,
and
withal
signifieth
<EOS>
God
's
covenant
not
to
destroy
the
world
any
more
with
water
,
but
a
bow
having
fire
in
it
,
and
signifying
God
's
anger
,
and
his
intention
to
destroy
London
with
fire
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
the
day
drew
to
a
close
,
and
it
became
darker
,
the
spectacle
increased
in
terror
and
sublimity
.
<EOS>
The
tall
black
towers
of
the
churches
assumed
ghastly
forms
,
and
to
some
eyes
appeared
like
infernal
spirits
plunging
in
a
lake
of
flame
,
while
even
to
the
most
reckless
the
conflagration
seemed
to
present
a
picture
of
the
terrors
of
the
Last
Day
.
<EOS>
Never
before
had
such
a
night
as
that
which
ensued
fallen
upon
London
.
<EOS>
None
of
its
inhabitants
thought
of
retiring
to
rest
,
or
if
they
sought
repose
after
the
excessive
fatigue
they
had
undergone
,
it
was
only
in
such
manner
as
would
best
enable
them
to
rise
and
renew
their
exertions
to
check
the
flames
,
which
were
continued
throughout
the
night
,
but
wholly
without
success
.
<EOS>
The
conflagration
appeared
to
proceed
at
the
same
appalling
rapidity
.
<EOS>
Halls
,
towers
,
churches
,
public
and
private
buildings
,
were
burning
to
the
number
of
more
than
ten
thousand
,
while
clouds
of
smoke
covered
the
vast
expanse
of
more
than
fifty
miles
.
<EOS>
Travellers
approaching
London
from
the
north
-
east
were
enveloped
in
it
ten
miles
off
,
and
the
fiery
reflection
in
the
sky
could
be
discerned
at
an
equal
distance
.
<EOS>
The
"
hideous
storm
,
"
as
Evelyn
terms
the
fearful
and
astounding
noise
produced
 
by
the
roaring
of
the
flames
and
the
falling
of
the
numerous
fabrics
,
continued
without
intermission
during
the
whole
of
that
fatal
night
.
  
<EOS>
VI
.
 
<EOS>
HOW
THE
GROCER
'S
HOUSE
WAS
BURNT
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
full
ten
o'clock
before
Leonard
could
obtain
permission
to
quit
the
king
's
party
,
and
he
immediately
hurried
to
Wood
-
street
.
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
entered
it
,
when
the
cry
of
"
fire
"
smote
his
ears
,
and
rushing
forward
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
,
he
beheld
Mr.
Bloundel
's
dwelling
in
flames
.
<EOS>
A
large
crowd
was
collected
before
the
burning
habitation
,
keeping
guard
over
a
vast
heap
of
goods
and
furniture
that
had
been
removed
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
much
beloved
was
Mr.
Bloundel
,
and
in
such
high
estimation
was
his
character
held
,
that
all
his
neighbours
,
on
learning
that
his
house
was
on
fire
,
flew
to
his
assistance
,
and
bestirred
themselves
so
actively
,
that
in
an
extraordinary
short
space
of
time
they
had
emptied
the
house
of
every
article
of
value
,
and
placed
it
out
of
danger
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
In
vain
the
grocer
urged
them
to
desist
:
his
entreaties
were
disregarded
by
his
zealous
friends
;
and
when
he
told
them
they
were
profaning
the
Sabbath
,
they
replied
that
the
responsibility
of
their
conduct
would
rest
entirely
on
themselves
,
and
they
hoped
they
might
never
have
anything
worse
to
answer
for
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
disapproval
of
what
was
done
,
the
grocer
could
not
but
be
sensibly
touched
by
their
devotion
,
and
as
to
his
wife
,
she
said
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
that
"
it
was
almost
worth
while
having
a
fire
to
prove
what
good
friends
they
had
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
at
this
juncture
that
Leonard
arrived
.
<EOS>
Way
was
instantly
made
for
him
,
and
leaping
over
the
piles
of
chests
and
goods
that
blocked
up
the
thoroughfare
,
he
flew
to
Mr.
Bloundel
,
who
was
standing
in
front
of
his
flaming
habitation
with
as
calm
and
unmoved
an
expression
of
countenance
as
if
nothing
was
happening
,
and
presently
ascertained
from
him
in
what
manner
the
fire
had
originated
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
that
while
the
whole
of
the
family
were
assembled
at
prayers
,
in
the
room
ordinarily
used
for
that
purpose
,
they
were
alarmed
at
supper
by
a
strong
smell
of
smoke
,
which
seemed
to
arise
from
the
lower
part
of
the
house
,
and
that
as
soon
as
their
devotions
were
ended
,
for
Mr.
Bloundel
would
not
allow
them
to
stir
before
,
Stephen
and
Blaize
had
proceeded
to
ascertain
the
cause
,
and
on
going
down
to
the
kitchen
,
found
a
dense
smoke
issuing
from
the
adjoining
cellar
,
the
door
of
which
stood
ajar
.
<EOS>
Hearing
a
noise
in
the
yard
,
they
darted
up
the
back
steps
,
communicating
with
the
cellar
,
and
discovered
a
man
trying
to
make
his
escape
over
the
wall
by
a
rope
-
ladder
.
<EOS>
Stephen
instantly
seized
him
,
and
the
man
,
drawing
a
sword
,
tried
to
free
himself
from
his
captor
.
<EOS>
In
the
struggle
,
he
dropped
a
pistol
,
which
Blaize
snatching
up
,
discharged
with
fatal
effect
against
the
wretch
,
who
,
on
examination
,
proved
to
be
Pillichody
.
 
<EOS>
Efforts
were
made
to
check
the
fire
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
The
villain
had
accomplished
his
diabolical
purpose
too
well
.
<EOS>
Acquainted
with
the
premises
,
and
with
the
habits
of
the
family
,
he
had
got
into
the
yard
by
means
of
a
rope
-
ladder
,
and
hiding
himself
till
the
servants
were
summoned
to
prayers
,
stole
into
the
cellar
,
and
placing
a
fire
-
ball
amid
a
heap
of
fagots
and
coals
,
and
near
several
large
casks
of
oil
,
and
other
inflammable
matters
,
struck
a
light
,
and
set
fire
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
ever
reproach
myself
that
I
was
away
when
this
calamity
occurred
,
"
observed
Leonard
,
as
the
grocer
brought
his
relation
to
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
will
do
so
without
reason
,
"
replied
Mr.
Bloundel
,
"
for
you
could
have
rendered
no
assistance
,
and
you
see
my
good
neighbours
have
taken
the
matter
entirely
out
of
my
hands
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Whither
do
you
intend
removing
,
sir
?
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
might
suggest
,
I
would
advise
you
to
go
to
Farmer
Wingfield
's
,
at
Kensal
Green
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
anticipated
my
intention
,
"
replied
the
grocer
;
"
but
we
must
now
obtain
some
vehicles
to
transport
these
goods
thither
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
that
my
part
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
And
in
a
short
space
of
time
he
had
procured
half
a
dozen
large
carts
,
into
which
the
whole
of
the
goods
were
speedily
packed
,
and
a
coach
having
been
likewise
fetched
by
Blaize
,
Mrs.
Bloundel
and
the
three
younger
children
,
together
with
old
Josyna
and
Patience
,
were
placed
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
your
mother
has
taken
care
of
her
money
,
"
whispered
the
latter
to
the
porter
,
as
he
assisted
her
into
the
vehicle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
whether
she
has
or
not
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
Blaize
,
in
the
same
tone
;
"
we
sha
n't
want
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
now
as
rich
as
my
master
--
perhaps
richer
.
<EOS>
On
stripping
that
rascal
Pillichody
,
I
found
a
large
bag
of
gold
,
besides
several
caskets
of
jewels
,
upon
him
,
all
of
which
I
consider
lawful
spoil
,
as
he
fell
by
my
hand
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
rejoined
Patience
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
he
did
not
come
very
honestly
by
the
treasures
,
but
you
ca
n't
help
that
,
you
know
.
"
 
<EOS>
Blaize
made
no
reply
,
but
pushing
her
into
the
coach
,
shut
the
door
.
<EOS>
All
being
now
in
readiness
,
directions
were
given
to
the
drivers
of
the
carts
whither
to
proceed
,
and
they
were
put
in
motion
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
grocer
's
firmness
deserted
him
.
<EOS>
Gazing
at
the
old
habitation
,
which
was
now
wrapped
in
a
sheet
of
flame
,
he
cried
in
a
voice
broken
with
emotion
,
"
In
that
house
I
have
dwelt
nearly
thirty
years
--
in
that
house
all
my
children
were
born
--
in
that
house
I
found
a
safe
refuge
from
the
devouring
pestilence
.
<EOS>
It
is
hard
to
quit
it
thus
.
"
 
<EOS>
Controlling
his
emotion
,
however
,
the
next
moment
,
he
turned
away
.
<EOS>
But
his
feelings
were
destined
to
another
trial
.
<EOS>
His
neighbours
flocked
round
him
to
bid
him
farewell
,
in
tones
of
such
sympathy
and
regard
,
that
his
constancy
again
deserted
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
thank
you
,
"
he
cried
,
pressing
in
turn
each
hand
that
was
offered
him
.
"
<EOS>
Your
kindness
will
never
be
effaced
from
my
memory
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
all
,
and
may
He
watch
over
you
and
protect
you
!
"
<EOS>
and
with
these
words
he
broke
from
them
.
<EOS>
So
great
was
the
crowd
and
confusion
in
Cheapside
,
that
nearly
two
hours
elapsed
before
they
reached
Newgate
;
and
,
indeed
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
interference
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
they
would
not
,
in
all
probability
,
have
got
out
of
the
city
at
all
.
<EOS>
The
earl
was
stationed
near
the
Old
'
Change
,
at
the
entrance
to
Saint
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
and
learning
their
distress
,
ordered
a
party
of
the
guard
by
whom
he
was
attended
to
force
a
passage
for
them
.
<EOS>
Both
Mr.
Bloundel
and
Leonard
would
have
declined
this
assistance
if
they
had
had
the
power
of
doing
so
,
but
there
was
no
help
in
the
present
case
.
 
<EOS>
They
encountered
no
further
difficulties
,
but
were
necessarily
compelled
to
proceed
at
a
slow
pace
,
and
did
not
reach
Paddington
for
nearly
two
hours
,
being
frequently
stopped
by
persons
eagerly
asking
as
to
the
progress
of
the
fire
.
<EOS>
One
circumstance
struck
the
whole
party
as
remarkable
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
tremendous
glare
of
the
conflagration
,
that
even
at
this
distance
the
fire
seemed
close
beside
them
,
and
if
they
had
not
known
the
contrary
,
they
would
have
thought
it
could
not
be
further
off
than
Saint
Giles
's
.
<EOS>
The
whole
eastern
sky
in
that
direction
seemed
on
fire
,
and
glowed
through
the
clouds
of
yellow
smoke
with
which
the
air
was
filled
with
fearful
splendour
.
<EOS>
After
halting
for
a
short
time
at
the
Wheat
Sheaf
,
which
they
found
open,--for
,
indeed
,
no
house
was
closed
that
night,--to
obtain
some
refreshment
,
and
allay
the
intolerable
thirst
by
which
they
were
tormented
,
the
party
pursued
their
journey
along
the
Harrow
-
road
,
and
in
due
time
approached
Wingfield
's
residence
.
 
<EOS>
The
honest
farmer
,
who
,
with
his
wife
and
two
of
his
men
,
was
standing
in
a
field
at
the
top
of
the
hill
,
gazing
at
the
conflagration
,
hearing
the
noise
occasioned
by
the
carts
,
ran
to
the
road
-
side
to
see
what
was
coming
,
and
encountered
Mr.
Bloundel
and
Leonard
,
who
had
walked
up
the
ascent
a
little
more
quickly
than
the
others
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
thinking
of
you
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
cordial
greeting
had
passed
between
them
,
"
and
wondering
what
would
become
of
you
in
this
dreadful
fire
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
had
just
told
my
dame
I
should
go
and
look
after
you
,
and
see
whether
I
could
be
of
any
service
to
you
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
should
be
better
pleased
to
see
you
in
any
way
<EOS>
but
this
,
though
you
could
not
be
welcomer
.
<EOS>
I
have
room
in
the
barn
and
outhouses
for
all
you
have
brought
,
and
hope
and
trust
you
have
not
lost
much
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
lost
nothing
except
the
old
house
,
"
replied
the
grocer
,
heaving
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Another
will
soon
be
built
,
"
rejoined
Wingfield
,
"
and
till
that
is
done
you
shall
not
quit
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
coach
having
by
this
time
arrived
,
Wingfield
hastened
towards
it
,
and
assisted
its
occupants
to
alight
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bloundel
was
warmly
welcomed
by
Dame
Wingfield
,
and
being
taken
with
her
children
to
the
house
,
was
truly
happy
to
find
herself
under
the
shelter
of
its
hospitable
roof
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
party
,
assisted
by
Wingfield
and
his
men
,
exerting
themselves
to
the
utmost
,
the
carts
were
speedily
unloaded
,
and
the
goods
deposited
in
the
barns
and
outhouses
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
the
drivers
were
liberally
rewarded
for
their
trouble
by
Mr.
Bloundel
,
and
after
draining
several
large
jugs
of
ale
brought
them
by
the
farmer
,
made
the
best
of
their
way
back
,
certain
of
obtaining
further
employment
during
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
Fatigued
as
he
was
,
Leonard
,
before
retiring
to
rest
,
could
not
help
lingering
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
to
gaze
at
the
burning
city
.
<EOS>
The
same
effect
was
observable
here
as
at
Paddington
,
and
the
conflagration
appeared
little
more
than
a
mile
off
.
<EOS>
The
whole
heavens
seemed
on
fire
,
and
a
distant
roar
was
heard
like
the
rush
of
a
high
wind
through
a
mighty
forest
.
<EOS>
Westminster
Abbey
and
Saint
Paul
's
could
be
distinctly
seen
in
black
relief
against
the
sheet
of
flame
,
together
with
innumerable
towers
,
spires
,
and
other
buildings
,
the
whole
constituting
a
picture
unsurpassed
for
terrific
grandeur
since
the
world
began
,
and
only
to
be
equalled
by
its
final
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
Having
gazed
at
the
conflagration
for
some
time
,
and
fancied
that
he
could
even
at
this
distance
discern
the
fearful
progress
it
made
,
Leonard
retired
to
the
barn
,
and
throwing
himself
upon
a
heap
of
straw
,
instantly
fell
asleep
.
<EOS>
He
was
awakened
the
next
morning
by
Farmer
Wingfield
,
who
came
to
tell
him
breakfast
was
ready
,
and
having
performed
his
ablutions
,
they
adjourned
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
Finding
Mr.
Bloundel
comfortably
established
in
his
new
quarters
,
Leonard
proposed
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
to
proceed
to
town
,
and
Wingfield
volunteered
to
accompany
him
.
<EOS>
Blaize
,
also
,
having
placed
his
treasures
,
except
a
few
pieces
of
gold
,
in
the
custody
of
Patience
,
begged
to
make
one
of
the
party
,
and
his
request
being
acceded
to
,
the
trio
set
out
on
foot
,
and
gleaning
fresh
particulars
of
the
fearful
progress
of
the
fire
,
as
they
advanced
,
passed
along
Oxford
-
road
,
and
crossing
Holborn
Bridge
,
on
the
western
side
of
which
they
were
now
demolishing
the
houses
,
mounted
Snow
-
hill
,
and
passed
through
the
portal
of
Newgate
.
 
<EOS>
Here
they
learnt
that
the
whole
of
Wood
-
street
was
consumed
,
that
the
fire
had
spread
eastward
as
far
as
Gutter
-
lane
,
and
that
Saint
Michael
's
Church
,
adjoining
Wood
-
street
,
Goldsmiths
'
Hall
,
and
the
church
of
Saint
John
Zachary
,
were
in
flames
.
<EOS>
They
were
also
told
that
the
greater
part
of
Cheapside
was
on
fire
,
and
wholly
impassable
--
while
the
destructive
element
was
invading
at
one
and
the
same
time
Guildhall
and
the
Royal
Exchange
.
<EOS>
They
furthermore
learnt
that
the
conflagration
had
spread
fearfully
along
the
side
of
the
river
,
had
passed
Queenhithe
,
consuming
all
the
wharves
and
warehouses
in
its
way
,
and
having
just
destroyed
Paul
's
Wharf
,
<EOS>
was
at
that
time
assailing
Baynard
's
Castle
.
<EOS>
This
intelligence
determined
them
not
to
attempt
to
proceed
further
into
the
city
,
which
they
saw
was
wholly
impracticable
;
and
they
accordingly
turned
down
Ivy
-
lane
,
and
approached
the
cathedral
with
the
intention
,
if
possible
,
of
ascending
the
central
tower
.
<EOS>
They
found
a
swarm
of
booksellers
'
porters
and
assistants
at
the
northern
entrance
,
engaged
in
transporting
immense
bales
of
books
and
paper
to
the
vaults
in
Saint
Faith
's
,
where
it
was
supposed
the
stock
would
be
in
safety
,
permission
to
that
effect
having
been
obtained
from
the
dean
and
chapter
.
 
<EOS>
Forcing
their
way
through
this
crowd
,
Leonard
and
his
companions
crossed
the
transept
,
and
proceeded
towards
the
door
of
the
spiral
staircase
leading
to
the
central
tower
.
<EOS>
It
was
open
,
and
they
passed
through
it
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
summit
of
the
tower
,
which
they
found
occupied
by
some
dozen
or
twenty
persons
,
a
spectacle
that
far
exceeded
the
utmost
stretch
of
their
imaginations
burst
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Through
clouds
of
tawny
smoke
scarcely
distinguishable
from
flame
,
so
thickly
were
they
charged
with
sparks
and
fire
-
flakes
,
they
beheld
a
line
of
fire
spreading
along
Cheapside
and
Cornhill
,
as
far
as
the
Royal
Exchange
,
which
was
now
in
flames
,
and
branching
upwards
in
another
line
through
Lawrence
-
lane
to
Guildhall
,
which
was
likewise
burning
.
<EOS>
Nearer
to
them
,
on
the
north
,
the
fire
kindled
by
the
wretched
Pillichody
,
who
only
,
perhaps
,
anticipated
the
work
of
destruction
by
a
few
hours
,
had
,
as
they
had
heard
,
proceeded
to
Goldsmiths
'
Hall
,
and
was
rapidly
advancing
down
Saint
Ann's
-
lane
to
Aldersgate
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
on
the
right
,
and
to
the
south
-
east
,
that
the
conflagration
assumed
its
most
terrific
aspect
.
<EOS>
There
,
from
Bow
Church
to
the
river
-
side
,
beyond
the
bridge
as
far
as
Billingsgate
,
and
from
thence
up
Mincing
-
lane
,
crossing
Fenchurch
-
street
and
Lime
-
street
to
Gracechurch
and
Cornhill
,
describing
a
space
of
more
than
two
miles
in
length
and
one
in
depth
,
every
habitation
was
on
fire
.
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
this
bed
of
flame
was
like
an
ocean
of
fire
agitated
by
a
tempest
,
in
which
a
number
of
barks
were
struggling
,
some
of
them
being
each
moment
engulfed
.
<EOS>
The
stunning
and
unearthly
roar
of
the
flames
aided
this
appearance
,
which
was
further
heightened
by
the
enormous
billows
of
flame
that
ever
and
anon
rolled
tumultuously
onward
as
they
were
caught
by
some
gust
of
wind
of
more
than
usual
violence
.
<EOS>
The
spires
of
the
churches
looked
like
the
spars
of
 
"
tall
admirals
,
"
that
had
foundered
,
while
the
blackening
ruins
of
the
halls
and
larger
buildings
well
represented
the
ribs
and
beams
of
mighty
hulks
.
 
<EOS>
Leaving
Leonard
and
his
companions
to
the
contemplation
of
this
tremendous
spectacle
,
we
shall
proceed
to
take
a
nearer
view
of
its
ravages
.
<EOS>
Every
effort
had
been
used
to
preserve
the
Royal
Exchange
by
the
city
authorities
,
and
by
the
engineers
,
headed
by
the
king
in
person
.
<EOS>
All
the
buildings
in
its
vicinity
were
demolished
.
<EOS>
But
in
vain
.
<EOS>
The
irresistible
and
unrelenting
foe
drove
the
defenders
back
as
before
,
seized
upon
their
barricades
,
and
used
them
,
like
a
skilful
besieger
,
against
the
fortress
they
sought
to
protect
.
<EOS>
Solomon
Eagle
,
who
was
mounted
upon
a
heap
of
ruins
,
witnessed
this
scene
of
destruction
,
and
uttered
a
laugh
of
exultation
as
the
flames
seized
upon
their
prey
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
,
"
he
cried
,
"
that
the
extortioners
and
usurers
who
resorted
to
that
building
,
and
made
gold
their
god
,
would
be
driven
forth
,
and
their
temple
destroyed
.
<EOS>
And
my
words
have
come
to
pass
.
<EOS>
It
burns
--
it
burns
--
<EOS>
and
so
shall
they
,
if
they
turn
not
from
their
ways
.
"
 
<EOS>
Hearing
this
wild
speech
,
and
beholding
the
extraordinary
figure
of
the
enthusiast
,
<EOS>
whose
scorched
locks
and
smoke
-
begrimed
limbs
gave
him
almost
the
appearance
of
an
infernal
spirit
,
the
king
inquired
,
with
some
trepidation
,
from
his
attendants
,
who
or
what
he
was
,
and
being
informed
,
ordered
them
to
seize
him
.
<EOS>
But
the
enthusiast
set
their
attempts
at
naught
.
<EOS>
Springing
with
wonderful
agility
from
fragment
to
fragment
of
the
ruins
,
and
continuing
his
vociferations
,
he
at
last
plunged
through
the
flame
into
the
Exchange
itself
,
rendering
further
pursuit
,
of
course
,
impossible
,
unless
those
who
desired
to
capture
him
,
were
determined
to
share
his
fate
,
which
now
seemed
inevitable
.
<EOS>
To
the
astonishment
of
all
,
however
,
he
appeared
a
few
minutes
afterwards
on
the
roof
of
the
blazing
pile
,
and
continued
his
denunciations
till
driven
away
by
the
flames
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
,
indeed
,
to
bear
a
charmed
life
,
for
it
was
rumoured
--
though
the
report
was
scarcely
credited
--
that
he
had
escaped
from
the
burning
building
,
and
made
good
his
retreat
to
Saint
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
the
Exchange
was
one
mass
of
flame
.
<EOS>
Having
gained
an
entrance
to
the
galleries
,
the
fire
ran
round
them
with
inconceivable
swiftness
,
as
was
the
case
in
the
conflagration
of
this
later
structure
,
and
filling
every
chamber
,
gushed
out
of
the
windows
,
and
poured
down
upon
the
courts
and
walks
below
.
<EOS>
Fearful
and
prodigious
was
the
ruin
that
ensued
.
<EOS>
The
stone
walls
cracked
with
the
intense
heat
--
tottered
and
fell
--
the
pillars
shivered
and
broke
asunder
,
the
statues
dropped
from
their
niches
,
and
were
destroyed
,
one
only
surviving
the
wreck
--
that
of
the
illustrious
founder
,
Sir
Thomas
Gresham
.
 
<EOS>
Deploring
the
fate
of
the
Royal
Exchange
,
the
king
and
his
attendants
proceeded
to
Guildhall
.
<EOS>
But
here
they
were
too
late
,
nor
could
they
even
rescue
a
tithe
of
the
plate
and
valuables
lodged
within
it
for
security
.
<EOS>
The
effects
of
the
fire
as
displayed
in
this
structure
,
were
singularly
grand
and
surprising
.
<EOS>
The
greater
part
of
the
ancient
fabric
being
composed
of
oak
of
the
hardest
kind
,
it
emitted
little
flame
,
but
became
after
a
time
red
hot
,
and
remained
in
this
glowing
state
till
night
,
when
it
resembled
,
as
an
eye
-
witness
describes
,
"
a
mighty
palace
of
gold
,
or
a
great
building
of
burnished
brass
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
greatest
fury
of
the
conflagration
was
displayed
at
the
Poultry
,
where
five
distinct
fires
met
,
and
united
their
forces
--
one
which
came
roaring
down
Cornhill
from
the
Royal
Exchange
--
a
second
down
Threadneedle
-
street
--
a
third
up
Walbrook
--
a
fourth
along
Bucklersbury
--
and
a
fifth
that
marched
against
the
wind
up
Cheapside
,
all
these
uniting
,
as
at
a
focus
,
a
whirl
of
flame
,
an
intensity
of
heat
,
and
a
thundering
roar
were
produced
,
such
as
were
nowhere
else
experienced
.
 
<EOS>
To
return
to
the
party
on
the
central
tower
of
the
cathedral:--Stunned
and
half
stifled
by
the
roar
and
smoke
,
Leonard
and
his
companions
descended
from
their
lofty
post
,
and
returned
to
the
body
of
the
fane
.
<EOS>
They
were
about
to
issue
forth
,
when
Leonard
,
glancing
down
the
northern
aisle
,
perceived
the
Earl
of
Rochester
and
Lord
Argentine
standing
together
at
the
lower
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
Their
gestures
showed
that
it
was
not
an
amicable
meeting
,
and
mindful
of
what
had
passed
at
Whitehall
,
Leonard
resolved
to
abide
the
result
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
he
saw
Lord
Argentine
turn
sharply
round
,
and
strike
his
companion
in
the
face
with
his
glove
.
<EOS>
The
clash
of
swords
instantly
succeeded
,
and
Leonard
and
Wingfield
started
forward
to
separate
the
combatants
.
<EOS>
Blaize
,
followed
,
but
more
cautiously
,
contenting
himself
with
screaming
at
the
top
of
his
voice
,
"
Murder
!
<EOS>
murder
!
<EOS>
sacrilege
!
<EOS>
a
duel
!
<EOS>
a
duel
!
"
 
<EOS>
Wingfield
was
the
first
to
arrive
at
the
scene
of
strife
,
but
just
as
he
reached
the
combatants
,
who
were
too
much
blinded
by
passion
to
notice
his
approach
,
Lord
Argentine
struck
his
adversary
's
weapon
from
his
grasp
,
and
would
have
followed
up
the
advantage
if
the
farmer
had
not
withheld
his
arm
.
<EOS>
Enraged
at
the
interference
,
Argentine
turned
his
fury
against
the
newcomer
,
and
strove
to
use
his
sword
against
him
--
but
in
the
terrible
struggle
that
ensued
,
and
at
the
close
of
which
they
fell
together
,
the
weapon
,
as
if
directed
by
the
hand
of
an
avenging
fate
,
passed
through
his
own
breast
,
inflicting
a
mortal
wound
.
 
<EOS>
"
Susan
Wingfield
is
avenged
!
"
said
the
farmer
,
as
he
arose
,
drenched
in
the
blood
of
his
opponent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Susan
Wingfield
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
wounded
man--"what
was
she
to
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Much
,
"
replied
the
farmer
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
my
daughter
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
Argentine
,
with
an
expression
of
unutterable
anguish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
me
have
your
forgiveness
,
"
he
groaned
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
it
,
"
replied
Wingfield
,
kneeling
beside
him
,
"
and
may
God
pardon
us
both
--
you
for
the
wrong
you
did
my
daughter
,
me
for
being
accidentally
the
cause
of
your
death
.
<EOS>
But
I
trust
you
are
not
mortally
hurt
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
many
minutes
to
live
,
"
 
replied
Argentine
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
is
not
that
Leonard
Holt
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
said
Rochester
,
stepping
forward
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
then
do
one
rightful
act
before
I
die
,
"
he
said
,
raising
himself
on
one
hand
,
and
holding
the
other
forcibly
to
his
side
,
so
as
to
stanch
in
some
degree
the
effusion
of
blood
.
"
<EOS>
Leonard
Holt
,
"
he
continued
,
"
my
sister
Isabella
loves
you
--
deeply
,
devotedly
.
<EOS>
I
have
tried
to
conquer
the
passion
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
You
have
my
consent
to
we
d
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
witness
to
your
words
my
lord
,
"
said
Rochester
,
"
and
I
call
upon
all
present
to
be
so
likewise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Rochester
,
you
were
once
my
friend
,
"
groaned
Argentine
,
"
and
may
yet
be
a
friend
to
the
dead
.
<EOS>
Remember
the
king
sells
titles
.
<EOS>
Teach
this
young
man
how
to
purchase
one
.
<EOS>
My
sister
must
not
we
d
one
of
his
degree
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Make
yourself
easy
on
that
score
,
"
replied
Rochester
;
"
he
has
already
sufficient
claim
upon
the
king
.
<EOS>
He
saved
his
life
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
will
trust
to
a
broken
reed
if
he
trusts
to
Charles
's
gratitude
,
"
replied
Argentine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Buy
the
title--_buy
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
My
sister
left
me
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
visited
my
anger
on
her
head
,
and
she
fled
.
<EOS>
I
believe
she
took
refuge
with
Doctor
Hodges
,
but
I
am
sure
he
can
tell
you
where
she
is
.
<EOS>
One
thing
more
,
"
continued
the
dying
man
,
fixing
his
glazing
eyes
on
Leonard
.
"
<EOS>
Go
to
Newgate
--
to
--
to
a
prisoner
there
--
an
incendiary
--
and
obtain
a
document
of
him
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
,
with
my
dying
breath
I
charged
you
to
do
this
.
<EOS>
It
will
enable
you
to
act
as
I
have
directed
.
<EOS>
Promise
me
you
will
go
.
<EOS>
Promise
me
you
will
fulfil
my
injunctions
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
,
"
rejoined
Argentine
.
<EOS>
"
May
you
be
happy
with
Isabella
.
"
<EOS>
And
removing
his
hand
from
his
side
,
a
copious
effusion
of
blood
followed
,
and
,
sinking
backwards
,
he
expired
.
  
<EOS>
VII

<EOS>
THE
BURNING
OF
SAINT
PAUL'S.
 
<EOS>
Several
other
persons
having
by
this
time
come
up
,
the
body
of
Lord
Argentine
was
conveyed
to
Bishop
Kempe
's
Chapel
,
and
left
there
till
a
fitting
season
should
arrive
for
its
removal
.
<EOS>
Confounded
by
the
tragical
event
that
had
taken
place
,
Leonard
remained
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
blood
-
stained
pavement
,
until
he
was
roused
by
an
arm
which
gently
drew
him
away
,
while
the
voice
of
the
Earl
of
Rochester
breathed
in
his
ear
,
"
This
is
a
sad
occurrence
,
Leonard
;
and
yet
it
is
most
fortunate
for
you
,
<EOS>
for
it
removes
the
only
obstacle
to
your
union
with
the
Lady
Isabella
.
<EOS>
You
see
how
fleeting
life
is
,
and
how
easily
we
may
be
deprived
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
reason
Lord
Argentine
into
calmness
;
but
nothing
would
satisfy
him
except
my
blood
;
and
there
he
lies
,
though
not
by
my
hand
.
<EOS>
Let
his
fate
be
a
lesson
to
us
,
and
teach
us
to
live
in
charity
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
I
have
wronged
you
--
deeply
wronged
you
;
but
I
will
make
all
the
atonement
in
my
power
,
and
let
me
think
I
am
forgiven
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
blood
rushed
tumultuously
to
Leonard
's
heart
as
he
listened
to
what
the
earl
said
,
but
overcoming
his
feelings
of
aversion
by
a
powerful
effort
,
he
took
the
proffered
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
forgive
you
my
lord
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Those
words
have
removed
a
heavy
weight
from
my
soul
,
"
replied
Rochester
;
"
and
if
death
should
trip
up
my
heels
as
suddenly
as
he
did
his
who
perished
on
this
spot
,
I
shall
be
better
prepared
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
And
now
let
me
advise
you
to
repair
to
Newgate
without
delay
,
and
see
the
wretched
man
,
and
obtain
the
document
from
him
.
<EOS>
The
fire
will
reach
the
gaol
ere
long
,
and
the
prisoners
must
of
necessity
be
removed
.
<EOS>
Amid
the
confusion
his
escape
might
be
easily
accomplished
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Recollect
,
my
lord
,
that
the
direful
conflagration
now
prevailing
without
is
owing
to
him
,
"
replied
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
be
accessory
to
his
escape
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
yet
his
death
by
the
public
executioner
,
"
urged
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
Think
of
its
effect
on
his
daughter
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Justice
must
take
its
course
,
"
rejoined
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
aid
him
to
escape
if
he
were
my
own
father
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
,
nothing
more
is
to
be
said
,
"
replied
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
But
at
all
events
,
see
him
as
quickly
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
I
would
accompany
you
,
but
my
duty
detains
me
here
.
<EOS>
When
you
return
from
your
errand
you
will
find
me
at
my
post
near
the
entrance
of
the
churchyard
in
front
of
Saint
Michael
's
le
Quern
;
that
is
,
if
I
am
not
beaten
from
it
.
<EOS>
Having
seen
the
father
,
your
next
business
must
be
to
seek
out
the
daughter
,
and
remove
her
from
this
dangerous
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
You
have
heard
where
she
is
to
be
found
.
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
they
separated
,
Leonard
and
his
companions
quitting
the
cathedral
by
the
great
western
entrance
,
and
proceeding
towards
Paul's
-
alley
,
and
the
earl
betaking
himself
to
the
north
-
east
corner
of
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
The
former
got
as
far
as
Ivy
-
lane
,
but
found
it
wholly
impassable
,
in
consequence
of
the
goods
and
furniture
with
which
it
was
blocked
up
.
<EOS>
They
were
,
therefore
,
obliged
to
return
to
the
precincts
of
the
cathedral
,
where
Blaize
,
who
was
greatly
terrified
by
what
he
had
seen
,
expressed
his
determination
of
quitting
them
,
and
hurried
back
to
the
sacred
pile
.
<EOS>
Leonard
and
the
farmer
next
essayed
to
get
up
Ave
Maria
-
lane
;
but
,
finding
that
also
impassable
,
they
made
for
Ludgate
,
and
,
after
a
long
delay
and
severe
struggle
,
got
through
the
portal
.
<EOS>
The
Old
Bailey
was
entirely
filled
with
persons
removing
their
goods
;
and
they
were
here
informed
,
to
their
great
dismay
,
that
the
conflagration
had
already
reached
Newgate
Market
,
which
was
burning
with
the
greatest
fury
,
and
was
at
that
moment
seizing
upon
the
gaol
.
<EOS>
No
one
,
however
,
in
answer
to
Leonard
's
inquiries
,
could
tell
him
what
had
become
of
the
prisoners
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
have
left
them
to
burn
,
"
observed
a
bystander
,
who
heard
the
question
with
a
malicious
look
;
"
and
it
is
the
best
way
of
getting
rid
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
Paying
no
attention
to
the
remark
,
nor
to
the
brutal
laugh
accompanying
it
,
Leonard
,
assisted
by
Wingfield
,
fought
his
way
through
the
crowd
till
he
reached
the
prison
.
<EOS>
The
flames
were
bursting
through
its
grated
windows
,
and
both
wings
,
as
well
as
the
massive
gate
connecting
them
,
were
on
fire
.
<EOS>
Regardless
of
the
risk
he
ran
,
Leonard
forced
his
way
to
the
lodge
-
door
,
where
two
turnkeys
were
standing
,
removing
their
goods
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
has
become
of
the
prisoners
?
"
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
debtors
are
set
free
,
"
replied
the
turnkey
addressed
,
"
and
all
but
one
or
two
of
the
common
felons
are
removed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
where
are
those
poor
creatures
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Leonard
,
horror
-
stricken
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
Stone
Hold
,
"
replied
the
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
have
you
left
them
to
perish
there
?
"
demanded
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
could
n't
help
it
,
"
rejoined
the
turnkey
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
been
risking
our
lives
to
venture
near
them
.
<EOS>
One
is
a
murderer
,
taken
in
the
fact
;
and
the
other
is
quite
as
bad
,
for
he
set
the
city
on
fire
;
so
its
right
and
fair
he
should
perish
by
his
own
contrivance
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
does
the
Stone
Hold
lie
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Leonard
,
in
a
tone
that
startled
the
turnkey
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
get
these
prisoners
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
<EOS>
,
I
tell
you
,
"
rejoined
the
turnkey
,
doggedly
.
<EOS>
"
They
're
burnt
to
a
cinder
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
your
keys
,
and
show
me
the
way
to
the
cell
,
"
cried
Leonard
,
authoritatively
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
at
least
attempt
to
save
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
you
're
determined
to
put
an
end
to
yourself
,
you
may
try
,
"
replied
the
turnkey
;
"
but
I
've
warned
you
as
to
what
you
may
expect
.
<EOS>
This
way
,
"
he
added
,
opening
a
door
,
from
which
a
thick
volume
of
smoke
issued
;
"
if
any
of
'em
's
alive
,
you
'll
soon
know
by
the
cries
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
as
if
in
answer
to
his
remark
,
a
most
terrific
shriek
at
that
moment
burst
on
their
ears
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
are
the
keys
,
"
cried
the
turnkey
,
delivering
them
to
Leonard
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
going
too
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
as
Wingfield
pushed
past
him
.
"
<EOS>
A
couple
of
madmen
!
<EOS>
I
should
n't
wonder
if
they
were
incendiaries
.
"
 
<EOS>
Directed
by
the
cries
,
Leonard
pressed
forward
through
the
blinding
and
stifling
smoke
.
<EOS>
After
proceeding
about
twenty
yards
,
he
arrived
at
a
cross
passage
where
the
smoke
was
not
quite
so
dense
,
as
it
found
an
escape
through
a
small
grated
aperture
in
the
wall
.
<EOS>
And
here
a
horrible
sight
was
presented
to
him
.
<EOS>
At
the
further
extremity
of
this
passage
was
a
small
cell
,
from
which
the
cries
he
had
heard
issued
.
<EOS>
Not
far
from
it
the
stone
roof
had
fallen
in
,
and
from
the
chasm
<EOS>
thus
caused
the
flames
were
pouring
into
the
passage
.
<EOS>
Regardless
of
the
risk
he
ran
,
Leonard
dashed
forward
,
and
reaching
the
cell
,
beheld
Grant
,
still
living
,
but
in
such
a
dreadful
state
,
that
it
was
evident
his
sufferings
must
soon
be
ended
.
<EOS>
His
hair
and
beard
were
singed
close
to
his
head
and
face
,
and
his
flesh
was
blistered
,
blackened
,
and
scorched
to
the
bone
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
Leonard
,
he
uttered
a
hoarse
cry
,
and
attempted
to
speak
,
but
the
words
rattled
in
his
throat
.
<EOS>
He
then
staggered
forward
,
and
,
to
Leonard
's
inexpressible
horror
,
thrust
his
arms
through
the
bars
of
the
cage
,
which
were
literally
red
-
hot
.
<EOS>
Seeing
he
had
something
in
one
hand
,
though
he
could
not
unclose
his
fingers
,
Leonard
took
it
from
him
,
and
the
wretched
man
fell
backwards
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
loud
crack
was
heard
in
the
wall
behind
.
<EOS>
Several
ponderous
stones
dropped
from
their
places
,
admitting
a
volume
of
flame
that
filled
the
whole
cell
,
and
disclosing
another
body
on
the
floor
,
near
which
lay
that
of
Grant
.
<EOS>
Horrified
by
the
spectacle
,
Leonard
staggered
off
,
and
,
catching
Wingfield
's
arm
,
sought
to
retrace
his
steps
.
<EOS>
This
was
no
easy
matter
,
the
smoke
being
so
dense
,
that
they
could
not
see
a
foot
before
them
,
and
was
obliged
to
feel
their
way
along
the
wall
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
the
cross
passage
,
Wingfield
would
fain
have
turned
off
to
the
right
,
but
Leonard
drew
him
forcibly
in
the
opposite
direction
;
and
most
fortunate
was
it
that
he
did
so
,
or
the
worthy
farmer
would
inevitably
have
perished
.
<EOS>
At
last
they
reached
the
lodge
,
and
sank
down
on
a
bench
from
exhaustion
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
,
my
masters
,
"
observed
the
turnkey
,
with
a
grim
smile
,
"
you
were
not
able
to
rescue
them
,
I
perceive
?
"
<EOS>
But
receiving
no
answer
,
he
added
,
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
what
did
you
see
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
sight
that
would
have
moved
even
your
stony
heart
to
compassion
,
"
returned
Leonard
,
getting
up
and
quitting
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
Followed
by
Wingfield
,
and
scarcely
knowing
where
he
was
going
,
he
forced
his
way
through
the
crowd
,
and
dashing
down
Snow
-
hill
,
did
not
stop
till
he
reached
Holborn
Conduit
,
<EOS>
where
,
seizing
a
leathern
bucket
,
he
filled
it
with
water
,
and
plunged
his
head
into
it
.
<EOS>
Refreshed
by
the
immersion
,
he
now
glanced
at
the
document
committed
to
him
by
Grant
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
piece
of
parchment
,
and
showed
by
its
shrivelled
and
scorched
appearance
the
agony
which
its
late
possessor
must
have
endured
,
Leonard
did
not
open
it
,
but
thrust
it
with
a
shudder
into
his
doublet
.
 
<EOS>
Meditating
on
the
strange
and
terrible
events
that
had
just
occurred
,
Leonard
's
thoughts
involuntarily
wandered
to
the
Lady
Isabella
,
whose
image
appeared
to
him
like
a
bright
star
shining
on
troubled
waters
,
and
for
the
first
time
venturing
to
indulge
in
a
hope
that
she
might
indeed
be
his
,
he
determined
immediately
to
proceed
in
search
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
now
high
noon
,
but
the
mid
-
day
sun
was
scarcely
visible
,
or
not
visible
at
all
;
as
it
struggled
through
the
masses
of
yellow
vapour
it
looked
red
as
blood
.
<EOS>
Bands
of
workmen
were
demolishing
houses
on
the
western
side
of
Fleet
Ditch
,
and
casting
the
rubbish
into
the
muddy
sluice
before
them
,
by
which
means
it
was
confidently
but
vainly
hoped
that
the
progress
of
the
fire
would
be
checked
.
<EOS>
Shaping
their
course
along
the
opposite
side
of
the
ditch
,
and
crossing
to
Fleet
Bridge
,
Leonard
and
his
companion
passed
through
Salisbury
-
court
to
Whitefriars
,
and
taking
a
boat
,
directed
the
waterman
to
land
them
at
Puddle
Dock
.
<EOS>
The
river
was
still
covered
with
craft
of
every
description
laden
with
goods
,
and
Baynard
's
Castle
,
an
embattled
stone
structure
of
great
strength
and
solidity
,
built
at
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
century
on
the
site
of
another
castle
as
old
as
the
Conquest
,
being
now
wrapped
in
flames
from
foundation
to
turret
,
offered
a
magnificent
spectacle
.
<EOS>
From
this
point
the
four
ascents
leading
to
the
cathedral
,
namely
,
Addle
-
hill
,
Saint
Bennet's
-
hill
,
Saint
Peter's
-
hill
,
and
Lambert
-
hill
,
with
all
their
throng
of
habitations
,
were
burning
--
the
black
lines
of
ruined
walls
standing
in
bold
relief
against
the
white
sheet
of
flame
.
<EOS>
Billows
of
fire
rolled
upwards
every
moment
towards
Saint
Paul
's
,
and
threatened
it
with
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
Landing
at
the
appointed
place
<EOS>
Leonard
and
his
companion
ascended
Saint
Andrew's
-
hill
,
and
,
proceeding
along
Carter
-
lane
,
soon
gained
the
precincts
of
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
Here
the
whole
mass
of
habitations
on
the
summit
of
Saint
Bennet's
-
hill
extending
from
the
eastern
,
end
of
Carter
-
lane
to
Distaff
-
lane
,
was
on
fire
,
and
the
flames
were
dashed
by
the
fierce
wind
against
the
south
-
east
corner
of
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
A
large
crowd
was
collected
at
this
point
,
and
great
efforts
were
made
to
save
the
venerable
pile
,
but
Leonard
saw
that
its
destruction
was
inevitable
.
<EOS>
Forcing
a
way
through
the
throng
with
his
companion
,
they
reached
Doctor
Hodges
's
residence
at
the
corner
of
Watling
-
street
,
and
Leonard
,
without
waiting
to
knock
,
tried
the
door
,
which
yielded
to
his
touch
.
<EOS>
The
habitation
was
empty
,
and
from
the
various
articles
scattered
about
it
was
evident
its
inmates
must
have
fled
with
the
greatest
precipitation
.
<EOS>
Alarmed
at
this
discovery
,
Leonard
rushed
forth
with
Wingfield
,
and
sought
to
ascertain
from
the
crowd
without
whither
Doctor
Hodges
was
gone
,
but
could
learn
nothing
more
than
that
he
had
departed
with
his
whole
household
a
few
hours
before
.
<EOS>
At
last
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
obtain
some
information
from
the
Earl
of
Rochester
,
and
he
was
about
to
cross
to
the
other
side
of
the
churchyard
,
when
he
was
arrested
by
a
simultaneous
cry
of
horror
from
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
Looking
upwards
,
for
there
he
saw
the
general
gaze
directed
,
he
perceived
that
the
scaffolding
around
the
roof
and
tower
of
the
cathedral
had
kindled
,
and
was
enveloping
the
whole
upper
part
of
the
fabric
in
a
network
of
fire
.
<EOS>
Flames
were
likewise
bursting
from
the
belfry
,
and
from
the
lofty
pointed
windows
below
it
,
flickering
and
playing
round
the
hoary
buttresses
,
and
disturbing
the
numerous
jackdaws
that
built
in
their
timeworn
crevices
,
and
now
flew
screaming
forth
.
<EOS>
As
Leonard
gazed
at
the
summit
of
the
tower
,
be
discerned
through
the
circling
eddies
of
smoke
that
enveloped
it
the
figure
of
Solomon
Eagle
standing
on
the
top
of
the
battlements
and
waving
his
staff
,
and
almost
fancied
he
could
hear
his
voice
.
<EOS>
After
remaining
in
this
perilous
situation
for
some
minutes
,
as
if
to
raise
anxiety
for
his
safety
to
the
highest
pitch
,
the
enthusiast
sprang
upon
a
portion
of
the
scaffolding
that
was
only
partly
consumed
,
and
descended
from
pole
to
pole
,
regardless
whether
burning
or
not
,
with
marvellous
swiftness
,
and
apparently
without
injury
.
<EOS>
Alighting
on
the
roof
,
he
speeded
to
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
fane
,
and
there
commenced
his
exhortations
to
the
crowd
below
.
 
<EOS>
It
now
became
evident
also
,
from
the
strange
roaring
noise
proceeding
from
the
tower
,
that
the
flames
were
descending
the
spiral
staircase
,
and
forcing
their
way
through
some
secret
doors
or
passages
to
the
roof
.
<EOS>
Determined
to
take
one
last
survey
of
the
interior
of
the
cathedral
before
its
destruction
,
which
he
now
saw
was
inevitable
,
Leonard
motioned
to
Wingfield
,
and
forcing
his
way
through
the
crowd
,
which
was
now
considerably
thinned
,
entered
the
southern
door
.
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
gained
the
middle
of
the
transept
when
the
door
opened
behind
him
,
and
two
persons
,
whom
,
even
in
the
brief
glimpse
he
caught
of
them
,
he
knew
to
be
Chowles
and
Judith
,
darted
towards
the
steps
leading
to
Saint
Faith
's
.
<EOS>
They
appeared
to
be
carrying
a
large
chest
,
but
Leonard
was
too
much
interested
in
what
was
occurring
to
pay
much
attention
to
them
.
<EOS>
There
were
but
few
persons
besides
himself
and
his
companion
within
the
cathedral
,
and
these
few
were
chiefly
booksellers
'
porters
,
who
were
hurrying
out
of
Saint
Faith
's
in
the
utmost
trepidation
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
,
these
were
gone
,
and
they
were
alone
--
alone
within
that
vast
structure
,
and
at
such
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Their
situation
,
though
perilous
,
was
one
that
awakened
thrilling
and
sublime
emotions
.
<EOS>
The
cries
of
the
multitude
,
coupled
with
the
roaring
of
the
conflagration
,
resounded
from
without
,
while
the
fierce
glare
of
the
flames
lighted
up
the
painted
windows
at
the
head
of
the
choir
with
unwonted
splendour
.
<EOS>
Overhead
was
heard
a
hollow
rumbling
noise
like
that
of
distant
thunder
,
which
continued
for
a
short
time
,
while
fluid
streams
of
smoke
crept
through
the
mighty
rafters
of
the
roof
,
and
gradually
filled
the
whole
interior
of
the
fabric
with
vapour
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
a
tremendous
cracking
was
heard
,
as
if
the
whole
pile
were
tumbling
in
pieces
.
<EOS>
So
appalling
was
this
sound
,
that
Leonard
and
his
companion
would
have
fled
,
but
they
were
completely
transfixed
by
terror
.
 
<EOS>
While
they
were
in
this
state
,
the
flames
,
which
had
long
been
burning
in
secret
,
burst
through
the
roof
at
the
other
end
of
the
choir
,
and
instantaneously
spread
over
its
whole
expanse
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
a
cry
of
wild
exultation
was
heard
in
the
great
northern
gallery
,
and
looking
up
,
Leonard
beheld
Solomon
Eagle
,
hurrying
with
lightning
swiftness
around
it
,
and
shouting
in
tones
of
exultation
,
"
My
words
have
come
to
pass
--
it
burns
--
it
burns
--
and
will
be
utterly
consumed
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
vociferations
of
the
enthusiast
were
answered
by
a
piercing
cry
from
below
,
proceeding
from
Blaize
,
who
at
that
moment
rushed
from
the
entrance
of
Saint
Faith
's
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
the
porter
,
Leonard
shouted
to
him
,
and
the
poor
fellow
hurried
towards
him
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
a
strange
hissing
sound
was
heard
,
as
if
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
were
descending
upon
the
roof
,
and
through
the
yawning
gap
over
the
choir
there
poured
a
stream
of
molten
lead
of
silvery
brightness
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
be
conceived
more
beautiful
than
this
shining
yet
terrible
cascade
,
which
descended
with
momentarily
increasing
fury
,
sparkling
,
flashing
,
hissing
,
and
consuming
all
before
it
.
<EOS>
All
the
elaborately
carved
woodwork
and
stalls
upon
which
it
fell
were
presently
in
flames
.
<EOS>
Leonard
and
his
companions
now
turned
to
fly
,
but
they
had
scarcely
moved
a
few
paces
when
another
fiery
cascade
burst
through
the
roof
near
the
great
western
entrance
,
for
which
they
were
making
,
flooding
the
aisles
and
plashing
against
the
massive
columns
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
,
too
,
a
third
stream
began
to
fall
over
the
northern
transept
,
not
far
from
where
Blaize
stood
,
and
a
few
drops
of
the
burning
metal
reaching
him
,
caused
him
to
utter
the
most
fearful
outcries
.
<EOS>
Seriously
alarmed
,
Leonard
and
Wingfield
now
rushed
to
one
of
the
monuments
in
the
northern
aisle
,
and
hastily
clambering
it
,
reached
a
window
,
which
they
burst
open
.
<EOS>
Blaize
followed
them
,
but
not
without
receiving
a
few
accidental
plashes
from
the
fiery
torrents
,
which
elicited
from
him
the
most
astounding
yells
.
<EOS>
Having
helped
him
to
climb
the
monument
,
Leonard
pushed
him
through
the
window
after
Wingfield
,
and
then
cast
his
eye
round
the
building
before
he
himself
descended
.
<EOS>
The
sight
was
magnificent
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
Prom
the
flaming
roof
<EOS>
three
silvery
cascades
descended
.
<EOS>
The
choir
was
in
flame
,
and
a
glowing
stream
like
lava
was
spreading
over
the
floor
,
and
slowly
trickling
down
the
steps
leading
to
the
body
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
The
transepts
and
the
greater
part
of
the
nave
were
similarly
flooded
.
<EOS>
Above
the
roar
of
the
flames
and
the
hissing
plash
of
the
descending
torrents
,
was
heard
the
wild
laughter
of
Solomon
Eagle
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
him
in
one
of
the
arcades
of
the
southern
gallery
,
Leonard
shouted
to
him
to
descend
,
and
make
good
his
escape
while
there
was
yet
time
,
adding
that
in
a
few
moments
it
would
be
too
late
.

I
shall
never
quit
it
more
,
"
rejoined
the
enthusiast
,
in
a
voice
of
thunder
,
"
but
shall
perish
with
the
fire
I
have
kindled
.
<EOS>
No
monarch
on
earth
ever
lighted
a
nobler
funeral
pyre
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
Leonard
passed
through
the
window
,
he
disappeared
along
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
Breaking
through
the
crowd
collected
round
Wingfield
and
Blaize
,
and
calling
to
them
to
follow
him
,
Leonard
made
his
way
to
the
north
-
east
of
the
churchyard
,
where
he
found
a
large
assemblage
of
persons
,
in
the
midst
of
which
were
the
king
,
the
Duke
of
York
,
Rochester
,
Arlington
,
and
many
others
.
<EOS>
As
Leonard
advanced
,
Charles
discerned
him
amid
the
crowd
,
and
motioned
him
to
come
forward
.
<EOS>
A
passage
was
then
cleared
,
for
him
,
through
which
Wingfield
and
Blaize
,
who
kept
close
beside
him
,
were
permitted
to
pass
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
find
no
harm
has
happened
to
you
,
friend
,
"
said
Charles
,
as
he
approached
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rochester
informed
me
you
were
gone
to
Newgate
,
and
as
the
gaol
had
been
burnt
down
,
I
feared
you
might
have
met
with
the
same
mishap
.
<EOS>
I
now
regret
that
I
did
not
adopt
your
plan
,
but
it
may
not
be
yet
too
late
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
too
late
to
save
a
portion
of
your
city
,
sire
,
"
replied
Leonard
;
"
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
how
much
is
gone
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
,
"
replied
the
king
,
mournfully
.
 
<EOS>
Further
conversation
was
here
interrupted
by
the
sudden
breaking
out
of
the
fire
from
the
magnificent
rose
window
of
the
cathedral
,
the
effect
of
which
,
being
extraordinarily
fine
,
attracted
the
monarch
's
attention
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
Solomon
Eagle
had
again
ascended
the
roof
,
and
making
his
way
to
the
eastern
extremity
,
clasped
the
great
stone
cross
that
terminated
it
with
his
left
hand
,
while
with
his
right
he
menaced
the
king
and
his
party
,
uttering
denunciations
that
were
lost
in
the
terrible
roar
prevailing
around
him
.
<EOS>
The
flames
now
raged
with
a
fierceness
wholly
inconceivable
,
considering
the
material
they
had
to
work
upon
.
<EOS>
The
molten
lead
poured
down
in
torrents
,
and
not
merely
flooded
the
whole
interior
of
the
fabric
,
but
ran
down
in
a
wide
and
boiling
stream
almost
as
far
as
the
Thames
,
consuming
everything
in
its
way
,
and
rendering
the
very
pavements
red
-
hot
.
<EOS>
Every
stone
,
spout
,
and
gutter
in
the
sacred
pile
,
of
which
there
were
some
hundreds
,
added
to
this
fatal
shower
,
and
scattered
destruction
far
and
wide
;
nor
will
this
be
wondered
at
when
it
is
considered
that
the
quantity
of
lead
thus
melted
covered
a
space
of
no
less
than
six
acres
.
<EOS>
Having
burned
with
incredible
fury
and
fierceness
for
some
time
,
the
whole
roof
of
the
sacred
structure
fell
in
at
once
,
and
with
a
crash
heard
at
an
amazing
distance
.
<EOS>
After
an
instant
's
pause
,
the
flames
burst
forth
from
every
window
in
the
fabric
,
producing
such
an
intensity
of
heat
,
that
the
stone
pinnacles
,
transom
beams
,
and
mullions
split
and
cracked
with
a
sound
like
volleys
of
artillery
,
shivering
and
flying
in
every
direction
.
<EOS>
The
whole
interior
of
the
pile
was
now
one
vast
sheet
of
flame
,
which
soared
upwards
,
and
consumed
even
the
very
stones
.
<EOS>
Not
a
vestige
of
the
reverend
structure
was
left
untouched
--
its
bells
--
its
plate
--
its
woodwork
--
its
monuments
--
its
mighty
pillars
--
its
galleries
--
its
chapels
--
all
,
all
were
destroyed
.
<EOS>
The
fire
raged
throughout
all
that
night
and
the
next
day
,
till
it
had
consumed
all
but
the
mere
shell
,
and
rendered
the
venerable
cathedral--"one
of
the
most
ancient
pieces
of
piety
in
the
Christian
world"--to
use
the
words
of
Evelyn
,
a
heap
of
ruin
and
ashes
.

<EOS>
HOW
LEONARD
RESCUED
THE
LADY
ISABELLA
.
 
<EOS>
The
course
of
events
having
been
somewhat
anticipated
in
the
last
chapter
,
it
will
now
be
necessary
to
return
to
an
earlier
stage
in
the
destruction
of
the
cathedral
,
namely
,
soon
after
the
furious
bursting
forth
of
the
flames
from
the
great
eastern
windows
.
<EOS>
While
Leonard
,
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
assemblage
,
was
gazing
at
this
magnificent
spectacle
,
he
heard
a
loud
cry
of
distress
behind
him
,
and
turning
at
the
sound
,
beheld
Doctor
Hodges
rush
forth
from
an
adjoining
house
,
the
upper
part
of
which
was
on
fire
,
almost
in
a
state
of
distraction
.
<EOS>
An
elderly
man
and
woman
,
and
two
or
three
female
servants
,
all
of
whom
were
crying
as
loud
as
himself
,
followed
him
.
<EOS>
But
their
screams
fell
on
indifferent
ears
,
for
the
crowd
had
become
by
this
time
too
much
accustomed
to
such
appeals
to
pay
any
particular
attention
to
them
.
<EOS>
Leonard
,
however
,
instantly
rushed
towards
the
doctor
,
and
anxiously
inquired
what
was
the
matter
;
the
latter
was
so
bewildered
that
he
did
not
recognise
the
voice
of
the
speaker
,
but
gazing
up
at
the
house
with
an
indescribable
anguish
,
cried
,
"
Merciful
God
!
<EOS>
the
flames
have
by
this
time
reached
her
room
--
she
will
be
burned
--
horror
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
will
be
burned
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Leonard
,
seizing
his
arm
,
and
gazing
at
him
with
a
look
of
apprehension
and
anguish
equal
to
his
own--"Not
the
Lady
Isabella
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Isabella
,
"
replied
Hodges
,
regarding
the
speaker
,
and
for
the
first
time
perceiving
by
whom
he
was
addressed
.
<EOS>
"
Not
a
moment
is
to
be
lost
if
you
would
save
her
from
a
terrible
death
.
<EOS>
She
was
left
in
a
fainting
state
in
one
of
the
upper
rooms
by
a
female
attendant
,
who
deserted
her
mistress
to
save
herself
.
<EOS>
The
staircase
is
on
fire
,
or
I
myself
would
have
saved
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
ladder
!
<EOS>
a
ladder
!
"
cried
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
is
one
,
"
cried
Wingfield
,
pointing
to
one
propped
against
an
adjoining
house
.
<EOS>
And
in
another
moment
,
by
the
combined
efforts
of
the
crowd
,
the
ladder
was
brought
and
placed
against
the
burning
building
.
 
<EOS>
"
Which
is
the
window
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Leonard
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
on
the
right
,
on
the
second
floor
,
"
replied
Hodges
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Gracious
Heaven
!
<EOS>
the
flames
are
bursting
from
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
Leonard
's
foot
was
now
on
the
ladder
,
and
rushing
up
with
inconceivable
swiftness
,
he
plunged
through
the
window
regardless
of
the
flame
.
<EOS>
All
those
who
witnessed
this
daring
deed
,
regarded
his
destruction
as
certain
,
and
even
Hodges
gave
him
up
for
lost
.
<EOS>
But
the
next
moment
he
appeared
at
the
window
,
bearing
the
fainting
female
form
in
his
arms
,
and
with
extraordinary
dexterity
obtaining
a
firm
footing
and
hold
of
the
ladder
,
descended
in
safety
.
<EOS>
The
shout
that
burst
from
such
part
of
the
assemblage
as
had
witnessed
this
achievement
,
and
its
successful
termination
,
attracted
the
king
's
attention
,
and
he
inquired
the
cause
of
the
clamour
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
ascertain
it
for
your
majesty
,
"
replied
Rochester
,
and
proceeding
to
the
group
,
he
learnt
,
to
his
great
satisfaction
,
what
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
Having
gained
this
intelligence
,
he
flew
back
to
the
king
,
and
briefly
explained
the
situation
of
the
parties
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Hodges
,
it
appeared
,
had
just
removed
to
the
house
in
question
,
which
belonged
to
one
of
his
patients
,
as
a
temporary
asylum
,
and
the
Lady
Isabella
had
accompanied
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
the
upper
part
of
the
house
when
the
fire
broke
out
,
and
was
so
much
terrified
that
she
swooned
away
,
in
which
condition
her
attendant
left
her
;
nor
was
the
latter
so
much
to
blame
as
might
appear
,
for
the
stairs
were
burning
at
the
time
,
and
a
moment
's
delay
would
have
endangered
her
own
safety
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fate
,
indeed
,
seems
to
have
brought
these
young
persons
together
,
"
replied
Charles
,
as
he
listened
to
Rochester
's
recital
,
who
took
this
opportunity
of
acquainting
him
with
Lord
Argentine
's
dying
injunctions
,
"
and
it
would
be
a
pity
to
separate
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
your
majesty
has
no
such
intention
,
"
said
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
,
"
rejoined
the
monarch
.
<EOS>
And
,
as
he
spoke
,
he
turned
his
horse
's
head
,
and
moved
towards
the
spot
where
Leonard
was
kneeling
beside
Isabella
,
and
supporting
her
.
<EOS>
Some
restoratives
having
been
applied
by
Doctor
Hodges
,
she
had
regained
her
sensibility
,
and
was
murmuring
her
thanks
to
her
deliverer
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
not
lost
her
beauty
,
I
perceive
,
"
cried
Charles
,
gazing
at
her
with
admiration
,
and
feeling
something
of
his
former
passion
revive
within
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
majesty
,
I
trust
,
will
not
mar
their
happiness
,
"
said
Rochester
,
noticing
the
monarch
's
libertine
look
with
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
"
Remember
,
you
owe
your
life
to
that
young
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
will
pay
the
debt
royally
,
"
replied
Charles
;
"
I
will
give
him
permission
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
majesty
's
permission
is
scarcely
needed
,
"
muttered
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
you
are
wrong
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
now
my
ward
,
and
I
can
dispose
of
her
in
marriage
as
I
please
;
nor
will
I
so
dispose
of
her
except
to
her
equal
in
rank
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
discern
your
majesty
's
gracious
intentions
,
"
replied
Rochester
,
gratefully
inclining
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
almost
forget
my
deliverer
's
name
,
"
whispered
Charles
,
with
a
smile
,
"
but
it
is
of
no
consequence
,
since
he
will
so
speedily
change
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
name
is
Leonard
Holt
,
"
replied
Rochester
,
in
the
same
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah!--true
,
"
returned
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
ho
!
<EOS>
good
Master
Leonard
Holt
,
"
he
added
,
addressing
the
young
man
,
"
commit
the
Lady
Isabella
Argentine
to
the
care
of
our
worthy
friend
Doctor
Hodges
for
a
moment
,
and
stand
up
before
me
.
"
<EOS>
His
injunctions
being
complied
with
,
he
continued
,
"
The
Lady
Isabella
Argentine
<EOS>
and
I
owe
our
lives
to
you
,
and
we
must
both
evince
our
gratitude
--
<EOS>
she
by
devoting
that
life
,
which
,
if
I
am
not
misinformed
,
she
will
be
right
willing
to
do
,
to
you
,
and
I
by
putting
you
in
a
position
to
unite
yourself
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
title
of
Argentine
has
been
this
day
extinguished
by
most
unhappy
circumstances
;
I
therefore
confer
the
title
on
you
,
and
here
in
this
presence
create
you
Baron
Argentine
,
of
Argentine
,
in
Staffordshire
.
<EOS>
Your
patent
shall
be
made
out
with
all
convenient
despatch
,
and
with
it
you
shall
receive
the
hand
of
the
sole
representative
of
that
ancient
and
noble
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
majesty
overwhelms
me
,
"
replied
Leonard
,
falling
on
his
knee
and
pressing
the
king
's
hand
,
which
was
kindly
extended
towards
him
,
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
scarcely
persuade
myself
I
am
not
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
soon
awaken
to
the
sense
of
the
joyful
reality
,
"
returned
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
I
not
now
discharged
my
debt
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
to
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
"
Right
royally
,
indeed
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
the
earl
,
in
a
tone
of
unaffected
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
he
added
,
grasping
Leonard
's
hand
,
"
I
sincerely
congratulate
you
on
your
newly
-
acquired
dignities
,
nor
less
in
the
happiness
that
awaits
you
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
do
not
answer
you
fittingly
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
new
-
made
peer
,
"
it
is
not
because
I
do
not
feel
your
kindness
.
<EOS>
But
my
brain
reels
.
<EOS>
Pray
Heaven
<EOS>
my
senses
may
not
desert
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
forget
the
document
you
obtained
this
morning
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Rochester
,
endeavouring
to
divert
his
thoughts
into
a
new
channel
.
<EOS>
"
The
proper
moment
for
consulting
it
may
have
arrived
.
"
 
<EOS>
Lord
Argentine
,
for
we
shall
henceforth
give
him
his
title
,
thrust
his
hand
into
his
doublet
,
and
drew
forth
the
parchment
.
<EOS>
He
opened
it
,
and
endeavoured
to
read
it
,
but
a
mist
swam
before
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
look
at
it
,
"
said
Rochester
,
taking
it
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
deed
of
gift
,
"
he
said
,
after
glancing
at
it
for
a
moment
,
"
from
the
late
Lord
Argentine
--
I
mean
the
elder
baron
--
of
a
large
estate
in
Yorkshire
,
which
he
possessed
in
right
of
his
wife
,
to
you
,
my
lord
,
here
described
as
Leonard
Holt
,
provided
you
shall
marry
the
Lady
Isabella
Argentine
.
<EOS>
Another
piece
of
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
Again
and
again
,
I
congratulate
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
said
Charles
,
"
other
and
less
pleasing
matters
claim
our
attention
.
<EOS>
Let
the
Lady
Isabella
be
removed
,
under
the
charge
of
Doctor
Hodges
,
to
Whitehall
,
where
apartments
shall
be
provided
for
her
at
once
,
together
with
fitting
attendants
,
and
where
she
can
remain
till
this
terrible
conflagration
is
<EOS>
over
which
,
I
trust
,
soon
will
be
,
when
I
will
no
longer
delay
her
happiness
,
but
give
her
away
in
person
.
<EOS>
Chiffinch
,
"
he
added
to
the
chief
page
,
"
see
all
this
is
carried
into
effect
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
my
liege
,
and
right
willingly
,
"
replied
Chiffinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
send
you
with
her
,
my
lord
,
"
pursued
Charles
to
Argentine
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
other
duties
for

<EOS>
The
plan
you
proposed
of
demolishing
the
houses
with
gunpowder
shall
be
immediately
put
into
operation
,
under
your
own
superintendence
.

<EOS>
A
chair
was
now
brought
,
and
the
Lady
Isabella
,
after
a
tender
parting
with
her
lover
,
being
placed
within
it
,
she
was
thus
transported
,
under
the
charge
of
Hodges
and
Chiffinch
,
to
Whitehall
,
where
she
arrived
in
safety
,
though
not
without
having
sustained
some
hindrance
and
inconvenience
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
not
been
gone
many
minutes
,
when
the
conflagration
of
the
cathedral
assumed
its
most
terrific
character
;
the
whole
of
the
mighty
roof
falling
in
,
and
the
flames
soaring
upwards
,
as
before
related
.
<EOS>
Up
to
this
time
,
Solomon
Eagle
had
maintained
his
position
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
roof
,
and
still
grasped
the
stone
cross
.
<EOS>
His
situation
now
attracted
universal
attention
,
for
it
was
evident
he
must
speedily
perish
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
wretch
!
"
exclaimed
the
king
,
shuddering
,
"
I
fear
there
is
no
way
of
saving
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
None
,
whatever
my
liege
,
"
replied
Rochester
,
"
nor
do
I
believe
he
would
consent
to
it
if
there
were
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
again
menacing
your
majesty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
Rochester
spoke
,
Solomon
Eagle
shook
his
arm
menacingly
at
the
royal
party
,
raising
it
aloft
,
as
if
invoking
the
vengeance
of
Heaven
.
<EOS>
He
then
knelt
down
upon
the
sloping
ridge
of
the
roof
,
as
if
in
prayer
,
and
his
figure
,
thus
seen
relieved
against
the
mighty
sheet
of
flame
,
might
have
been
taken
for
an
image
of
Saint
John
the
Baptist
carved
in
stone
.
<EOS>
Not
an
eye
in
the
vast
crowd
below
but
was
fixed
on
him
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
he
rose
again
,
and
tossing
his
arms
aloft
,
and
shrieking
,
in
a
voice
distinctly
heard
above
the
awful
roar
around
him
,
the
single
word
"
_
Resurgam
!
<EOS>
_
"
flung
himself
headlong
into
the
flaming
abyss
.
<EOS>
A
simultaneous
cry
of
horror
rose
from
the
whole
assemblage
on
beholding
this
desperate
action
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
last
exclamation
of
the
poor
wretch
may
apply
to
the
cathedral
,
as
well
as
to
himself
,
"
remarked
the
monarch
,
to
a
middle
-
aged
personage
,
with
a
pleasing
and
highly
intellectual
countenance
,
standing
near
him
:
"
for
the
old
building
shall
rise
again
,
like
a
phoenix
from
its
fires
,
with
renewed
beauty
,
and
under
your
superintendence
,
Doctor
Christopher
Wren
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
great
architect
bowed
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
hope
to
erect
such
another
structure
,
"
he
said
,
modestly
;
"
but
I
will
endeavour
to
design
an
edifice
that
shall
not
disgrace
your
majesty
's
city
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
build
me
another
city
at
the
same
time
,
Doctor
Wren
,
"
sighed
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
"
is
not
that
Mr.
Lilly
,
the
almanac
-
maker
,
whom
I
see
among
the
crowd
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bid
him
come
to
me
,
"
replied
the
king
.
<EOS>
And
the
order
being
obeyed
,
he
said
to
the
astrologer
,
"
Well
,
Mr.
Lilly
,
your
second
prediction
has
come
to
pass
.
<EOS>
We
have
had
the
Plague
,
and
now
we
have
the
Fire
.
<EOS>
You
may
thank
my
clemency
that
I
do
not
order
you
to
be
cast
into
the
flames
,
like
the
poor
wretch
who
has
just
perished
before
our
eyes
,
as
a
wizard
and
professor
of
the
black
art
.
<EOS>
How
did
you
obtain
information
of
these
fatal
events
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
a
careful
study
of
the
heavenly
bodies
,
sire
,
"
replied
Lilly
,
"
and
by
long
and
patient
calculations
,
which
,
if
your
majesty
or
any
of
your
attendants
had
had
leisure
or
inclination
to
make
,
would
have
afforded
you
the
same
information
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
make
no
pretence
to
the
gift
of
prophecy
,
but
this
calamity
was
predicted
in
the
last
century
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
by
whom
?
"
asked
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
Michael
Nostradamus
,
"
replied
Lilly
;
"
his
prediction
runs
thus:--
   
'

]
 
<EOS>
And
thus
I
venture
to
explain
it
.
<EOS>
The
'
blood
of
the
just

refers
to
the
impious
and
execrable
murder
of
your
majesty
's
royal
father
of
blessed
memory

it

likewise
give
us
,
as
will
be
seen
by
computation
hereafter
,
the
amount
of
habitations
to
be
destroyed
.
<EOS>
The
'
Ancient

'
undoubtedly
refers
to
the
venerable
pile
now
burning
before
us

which
,
as
it
stands
in
the
most
eminent
spot
in
the
city

clearly
'
falls
from
its
high
place

<EOS>
The
expression

of

refers
not
to
men
,

churches
,
of

a
large

grieve
to

it
,
are

"
The
prophecy
is
a
singular
one
,
"
remarked
Charles
,
musingly
"
and
you
have
given
it
a
plausible
interpretation
.
<EOS>
"
And
for
some
moments
he
appeared
lost
in
reflection
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
rousing
himself
,
he
took
forth
his
tablets
,
and
hastily
tracing
a
few
lines
upon
a
leaf
,
tore
it
out
,
and
delivered
it
with
his
signet

to
Lord

"
Take

You

replied
Argentine--"your

<EOS>
WHAT
BEFEL
CHOWLES
AND
JUDITH
IN
THE
VAULTS
OF
SAINT
FAITH'S.
 
<EOS>
Having
now
seen
what
occurred
outside
Saint
Paul
's
,
we
shall
proceed
to
the
vaults
beneath
it
.
<EOS>
Chowles
and
Judith
,
it
has
been
mentioned
,
were
descried
by
Leonard
,
just
before
the
outbreak
of
the
fire
,
stealing
into
Saint
Faith
's
,
and
carrying
a
heavy
chest
between
them
.
<EOS>
This
chest
contained
some
of
the
altar
-
plate
,
which
they
had
pillaged
from
the
Convocation
House
.
<EOS>
As
they
traversed
the
aisles
of
Saint
Faith
's
,
which
were
now
filled
with
books
and
paper
,
they
could
distinctly
hear
the
raging
of
the
fire
without
,
and
Judith
,
who
was
far
less
intimidated
than
her
companion
,
observed
,
"
Let
it
roar
on
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
injure
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
so
sure
of
that
,
"
replied
Chowles
,
doubtfully
,
"
<EOS>
I
wish
we
had
taken
our
hoards
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
use
in
wishing
that
now
,
"
rejoined
Judith
.
"
<EOS>
And
it
would
have
been
wholly
impossible
to
get
them
out
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
But
have
no
fear
.
<EOS>
The
fire
,
I
tell
you
,
can
not
reach
us
.
<EOS>
It
could
as
soon
burn
into
the
solid
earth
as
into
this
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
comforts
me
to
hear
you
say
so
,
"
replied
Chowles
.
"
<EOS>
And
when
I
think
of
those
mighty
stone
floors
above
us
,
I
feel
we
are
quite
safe
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
it
can
never
make
its
way
through
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
discoursing
,
they
reached
the
charnel
at
the
further
end
of
the
church
,
where
Chowles
struck
a
light
,
and
producing
a
flask
of
strong
waters
,
took
a
copious
draught
himself
and
handed
the
flask
to
Judith
,
who
imitated
his
example
.
<EOS>
Their
courage
being
thus
stimulated
,
they
opened
the
chest
,
and
Chowles
was
so
enraptured
with
its
glittering
contents
that
he
commenced
capering
round
the
vault
.
<EOS>
Recalled
to
quietude
by
a
stern
reproof
from
Judith
,
he
opened
a
secret
door
in
the
wall
,
and
pushed
the
chest
into
a
narrow
passage
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
Fearful
of
being
discovered
in
their
retreat
,
they
took
a
basket
of
provisions
and
liquor
with
them
,
and
then
closed
the
door
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
,
they
proceeded
along
the
passage
,
pushing
the
chest
before
them
,
until
they
came
to
a
descent
of
a
few
steps
,
which
brought
them
to
a
large
vault
,
half
-
filled
with
bags
of
gold
,
chests
of
plate
,
caskets
,
and
other
plunder
.
<EOS>
At
the
further
end
of
this
vault
was
a
strong
wooden
door
.
<EOS>
Pushing
the
chest
into
the
middle
of
the
chamber
,
Chowles
seated
himself
upon
it
,
and
opening
the
basket
of
provisions
,
took
out
the
bottle
of
spirits
,
and
again
had
recourse
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
comfortable
and
secure
we
feel
in
this
quiet
place
,
"
he
said
;
"
while
all
above
us
is
burning
.
<EOS>
I
declare
I
feel
quite
merry
,
ha
!
ha
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
forced
a
harsh
and
discordant
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
the
bottle
,
"
rejoined
Judith
,
sternly
,
"
and
do
n't
grin
like
a
death
's
head
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
to
see
the
frightful
face
you
make
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
first
time
you
ever
thought
my
face
frightful
,
"
replied
Chowles
,
"
and
I
begin
to
think
you
are
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Afraid
!
"
echoed
Judith
,
forcing
a
derisive
laugh
in
her
turn
;
"
afraid
--
of
what
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
do
n't
know
,
"
replied
Chowles
;
"
only
I
feel
a
little
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
What
if
we
should
not
be
able
to
breathe
here
?
<EOS>
The
very
idea
gives
me
a
tightness
across
the
chest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Silence
!
"
cried
Judith
,
with
a
fierceness
that
effectually
insured
obedience
to
her
command
.
 
<EOS>
Chowles
again
had
recourse
to
the
bottle
,
and
deriving
a
false
courage
from
it
,
as
before
,
commenced
skipping
about
the
chamber
in
his
usual
fantastical
manner
.
<EOS>
Judith
,
did
not
attempt
to
check
him
,
but
remained
with
her
chin
resting
upon
her
hand
gazing
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
the
Dance
of
Death
,
Judith
?
"
he
cried
,
executing
some
of
the
wildest
flourishes
he
had
then
performed
,
"
and
how
I
surprised
the
Earl
of
Rochester
and
his
crew
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
Judith
,
sternly
,
"
and
I
hope
we
may
not
soon
have
to
perform
that
dance
together
in
reality
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
merry
night
,
"
rejoined
Chowles
,
who
did
not
hear
what
she
said
,
"
a
right
merry
night
--
and
so
to
-
night
shall
be
,
in
spite
of
what
is
occurring
overhead
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
ha
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
took
another
long
pull
at
the
flask
.
<EOS>
"
I
breathe
freely
now
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
continued
his
wild
flourishes
until
he
was
completely
exhausted
.
<EOS>
He
then
sat
down
by
Judith
,
and
would
have
twined
his
bony
arms
round
her
neck
,
but
she
roughly
repulsed
him
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
growl
of
displeasure
,
he
then
proceeded
to
open
and
examine
the
various
bags
,
chests
,
and
caskets
piled
upon
the
floor
,
and
the
sight
of
their
contents
so
excited
Judith
,
that
shaking
off
her
misgivings
,
she
joined
him
,
and
they
continued
opening
case
after
case
,
glutting
their
greedy
eyes
,
until
Chowles
became
aware
that
the
vault
was
filled
with
smoke
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
perceived
this
,
he
started
to
his
feet
in
terror
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
lost
--
we
shall
be
suffocated
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
!
<EOS>
Judith
likewise
arose
,
and
her
looks
showed
that
she
shared
in
his
apprehensions
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
not
stay
here
,
"
cried
Chowles
;
"
and
yet
,
"
he
added
,
with
an
agonised
look
at
the
rich
store
before
him
,
"
the
treasure
!
<EOS>
the
treasure
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
let
us
,
at
least
,
take
something
with
us
,
"
rejoined
Judith
,
snatching
up
two
or
three
of
the
most
valuable
caskets
.
 
<EOS>
While
Chowles
gazed
at
the
heap
before
him
,
hesitating
what
to
select
,
the
smoke
grew
so
dense
around
them
,
that
Judith
seized
his
arm
,
and
dragged
him
away
.
<EOS>
"
I
come
--
I
come
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
snatching
up
a
bag
of
gold
.
 
<EOS>
They
then
threaded
the
narrow
passage
,
Judith
leading
the
way
and
bearing
the
light
.
<EOS>
The
smoke
grew
thicker
and
thicker
as
they
advanced
;
but
regardless
of
this
,
they
hurried
to
the
secret
door
leading
to
the
charnel
.
<EOS>
Judith
touched
the
spring
,
but
as
she
did
so
,
a
sheet
of
flame
burst
in
and
drove
her
back
.
<EOS>
Chowles
dashed
passed
her
,
and
with
great
presence
of
mind
shut
the
door
,
excluding
the
flame
.
<EOS>
They
then
hastily
retraced
their
steps
,
feeling
that
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
if
they
would
escape
.
<EOS>
The
air
in
the
vault
,
thickened
by
the
smoke
,
had
become
so
hot
that
they
could
scarcely
breathe
;
added
to
which
,
to
increase
their
terror
,
they
heard
the
most
awful
cracking
of
the
walls
overhead
,
as
if
the
whole
fabric
were
breaking
asunder
to
its
foundation
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
cathedral
is
tumbling
upon
us
!
<EOS>
We
shall
be
buried
alive
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Chowles
,
as
he
listened
with
indescribable
terror
to
the
noise
overhead
!
 
<EOS>
"
I
owe
my
death
to
you
,
wretch
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Judith
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
You
persuaded
me
to
come
hither
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Chowles
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
lie
!
<EOS>
You
were
the
person
who
proposed
it
.
<EOS>
But
for
you
I
should
have
left
our
hoards
here
,
and
come
for
them
after
the
fire
was
over
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
you
who
lie
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Judith
,
with
increased
fury
,
"
that
was
my
proposal
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
you
she
-
devil
,
"
cried
Chowles
,
"
it
is
you
who
have
brought
me
into
this
strait
--
and
if
you
do
not
cease
taunting
me
,
I
will
silence
you
for
ever
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Coward
and
fool
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Judith
,
"
I
will
at
least
have
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
you
die
before
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
she
spoke
,
she
rushed
towards
him
,
and
a
desperate
struggle
commenced
.
<EOS>
And
thus
while
the
walls
were
cracking
overhead
,
threatening
them
with
instant
destruction
,
the
two
wretches
continued
their
strife
,
uttering
the
most
horrible
blasphemies
and
execrations
.
<EOS>
Judith
,
being
the
stronger
of
the
two
,
had
the
advantage
,
and
she
had
seized
her
opponent
by
the
throat
with
the
intention
of
strangling
him
,
when
a
most
terrific
crash
was
heard
causing
her
to
loose
her
gripe
.
<EOS>
The
air
instantly
became
as
hot
as
the
breath
of
a
furnace
,
and
both
started
to
their
feet
.
<EOS>
"
What
has
happened
?
"
gasped
Chowles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
,
"
replied
Judith
,
"
and
I
dare
not
look
down
the
passage
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
,
"
replied
Chowles
,
and
he
advanced
a
few
paces
up
it
,
and
then
hastily
returned
,
shrieking
,
"
it
is
filled
with
boiling
lead
,
and
the
stream
is
flowing
towards
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
able
to
credit
the
extent
of
the
danger
,
Judith
gazed
down
the
passage
,
and
there
beheld
a
glowing
silvery
stream
trickling
slowly
onwards
.
<EOS>
She
saw
too
well
,
that
if
they
could
not
effect
their
retreat
instantly
,
their
fate
was
sealed
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
door
of
the
vault
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
pointing
towards
it
,
"
where
is
the
key
?
<EOS>
where
is
the
key
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
got
it
,
"
replied
Chowles
,
distractedly
,
"
I
can
not
tell
where
to
find
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
we
are
lost
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Judith
,
with
a
terrible
execration
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
,
"
replied
Chowles
,
<EOS>
snatching
up
a
pickaxe
,
"
if
I
can
not
unlock
the
door
,
I
can
break
it
open
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
commenced
furiously
striking
against
it
,
while
Judith
,
who
was
completely
horror
-
stricken
,
and
filled
with
the
conviction
that
her
last
moments
were
at
hand
,
fell
on
her
knees
beside
him
,
and
gazing
down
the
passage
,
along
which
she
could
see
the
stream
of
molten
lead
,
now
nearly
a
foot
in
depth
,
gradually
advancing
,
and
hissing
as
it
came
,
shrieked
to
Chowles
to
increase
his
exertions
.
<EOS>
He
needed
no
incitement
to
do
so
,
but
nerved
by
fear
,
continued
to
deal
blow
after
blow
against
the
door
,
until
at
last
he
effected
a
small
breach
just
above
the
lock
.
<EOS>
But
this
only
showed
him
how
vain
were
his
hopes
,
for
a
stream
of
fire
and
smoke
poured
through
the
aperture
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
,
he
continued
his
exertions
,
Judith
shrieking
all
the
time
,
until
the
lock
at
last
yielded
.
<EOS>
He
then
threw
open
the
door
,
but
finding
the
whole
passage
involved
in
flame
,
was
obliged
to
close
it
.
<EOS>
Judith
had
now
risen
,
and
their
looks
at
each
other
at
this
fearful
moment
were
terrible
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
Retreating
to
either
side
of
the
cell
,
they
glared
at
each
other
like
wild
beasts
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
Judith
casting
her
eyes
to
the
entrance
of
the
vault
,
uttered
a
yell
of
terror
,
that
caused
her
companion
to
look
in
that
direction
,
and
he
perceived
that
the
stream
of
molten
lead
had
gained
it
,
and
was
descending
the
steps
.
<EOS>
He
made
a
rush
towards
the
door
at
the
same
time
with
Judith
,
and
another
struggle
ensued
,
in
which
he
succeeded
in
dashing
her
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
He
again
opened
the
door
,
but
was
again
driven
backwards
by
the
terrific
flame
,
and
perceived
that
the
fiery
current
had
reached
Judith
,
who
was
writhing
and
shrieking
in
its
embrace
.
<EOS>
Before
Chowles
could
again
stir
,
it
was
upon
him
.
<EOS>
With
a
yell
of
anguish
,
he
fell
forward
,
and
was
instantly
stifled
in
the
glowing
torrent
,
which
in
a
short
time
flooded
the
whole
chamber
,
burying
the
two
partners
in
iniquity
,
and
the
whole
of
their
ill
-
gotten
gains
,
in
its
burning
waves
.

CONCLUSION
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Argentine
proceeded
,
as
directed
by
the
king
,
to
the
eastern
end
of
Tower
-
street
,
where
he
found
Lord
Craven
,
and
having
delivered
him
the
king
's
missive
,
and
shown
him
the
signet
,
they
proceeded
to
the
western
side
of
the
Tower
Dock
,
and
having
procured
a
sufficient
number
of
miners
and
engineers
,
together
with
a
supply
of
powder
from
the
fortress
,
commenced
undermining
the
whole
of
the
row
of
habitations
called
Tower
-
bank
,
on
the
edge
of
the
dock
,
having
first
,
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
state
,
taken
care
to
clear
them
of
their
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
The
powder
deposited
,
the
trains
were
fired
,
and
the
buildings
blown
into
the
air
.
<EOS>
At
this
time
the
whole
of
the
western
side
of
the
Tower
Moat
was
covered
with
low
wooden
houses
and
sheds
,
and
,
mindful
of
the
king
's
instructions
,
Lord
Argentine
suggested
to
Lord
Craven
that
they
should
be
destroyed
.
<EOS>
The
latter
acquiescing
,
they
proceeded
to
their
task
,
and
in
a
short
time
the
whole
of
the
buildings
of
whatever
description
,
from
the
bulwark
-
gate
to
the
city
postern
,
at
the
north
of
the
Tower
,
and
nearly
opposite
the
Bowyer
Tower
,
were
destroyed
.
<EOS>
Long
before
this
was
accomplished
they
were
joined
by
the
Duke
of
York
,
who
lent
his
utmost
assistance
to
the
task
,
and
when
night
came
on
,
a
clear
space
of
at
least
a
hundred
yards
in
depth
,
had
been
formed
between
the
ancient
fortress
and
the
danger
with
which
it
was
threatened
.
 
<EOS>
Meantime
the
conflagration
continued
to
rage
with
unabated
fury
.
<EOS>
It
burnt
throughout
the
whole
of
Monday
night
,
and
having
destroyed
Saint
Paul
's
,
as
before
related
,
poured
down
Ludgate
-
hill
,
consuming
all
in
its
way
,
and
,
crossing
Fleet
Bridge
,
commenced
its
ravages
upon
the
great
thoroughfare
adjoining
it
.
<EOS>
On
Tuesday
an
immense
tract
was
on
fire
.
<EOS>
All
Fleet
-
street
,
as
far
as
the
Inner
Temple
,
Ludgate
-
hill
,
and
the
whole
of
the
city
eastwards
,
along
the
banks
of
the
Thames
,
up
to
the
Tower
Dock
,
where
the
devastation
was
checked
by
the
vast
gap
of
houses
demolished
,
were
in
flames
.
<EOS>
From
thence
the
boundary
of
the
fire
extended
to
the
end
of
Mark
-
lane
,
Lime
-
street
,
and
Leadenhall
,
the
strong
walls
of
which
resisted
its
fury
.
<EOS>
Ascending
again
by
the
Standard
on
Cornhill
,
Threadneedle
-
street
,
and
Austin
Friars
,
it
embraced
Drapers
'
Hall
,
and
the
whole
mass
of
buildings
to
the
west
of
Throgmorton
-
street
.
<EOS>
It
next
proceeded
to
the
then
new
buildings
behind
Saint
Margaret
's
,
Lothbury
,
and
so
on
westward
to
the
upper
end
of
Cateaton
-
street
,
whence
it
spread
to
the
second
postern
in
London
Wall
,
and
destroying
the
ramparts
and
suburbs
as
far
as
Cripplegate
,
consumed
Little
Wood
-
street
,
Mungwell
-
street
,
and
the
whole
of
the
city
wall
on
the
west
as
far
as
Aldersgate
.
<EOS>
Passing
a
little
to
the
north
of
Saint
Sepulchre
's
,
which
it
destroyed
,
it
crossed
Holborn
Bridge
,
and
ascending
Saint
Andrew's
-
hill
,
passed
the
end
of
Shoe
-
lane
,
and
so
on
to
the
end
of
Fetter
-
lane
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
the
buildings
contained
within
this
boundary
were
now
on
fire
,
and
burning
with
terrific
fury
.
<EOS>
And
so
they
continued
till
the
middle
of
Wednesday
,
when
the
wind
abating
,
and
an
immense
quantity
of
houses
being
demolished
according
to
Lord
Argentine
's
plan
,
the
conflagration
was
got
under
;
and
though
it
broke
out
in
several
places
after
that
time
,
little
mischief
was
done
,
and
it
may
be
said
to
have
ceased
on
the
middle
of
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
On
Saturday
morning
in
that
week
,
soon
after
daybreak
,
a
young
man
,
plainly
yet
richly
attired
in
the
habiliments
then
worn
by
persons
of
high
rank
,
took
his
way
over
the
smouldering
heaps
of
rubbish
,
and
along
the
ranks
of
ruined
and
blackened
walls
denoting
the
habitations
that
had
once
constituted
Fleet
-
street
.
<EOS>
It
was
with
no
little
risk
,
and
some
difficulty
,
that
he
could
force
his
way
,
now
clambering
over
heaps
of
smouldering
ashes
,
now
passing
by
some
toppling
wall
,
which
fell
with
a
terrific
crash
after
he
had
just
passed
it
--
now
creeping
under
an
immense
pile
of
blackened
rafters
;
but
he
at
length
reached
Fleet
Bridge
,
where
he
paused
to
gaze
at
the
scene
of
devastation
around
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
indeed
a
melancholy
sight
,
and
drew
tears
to
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
ravages
of
the
fire
were
almost
inconceivable
.
<EOS>
Great
beams
were
burnt
to
charcoal
--
stones
calcined
,
and
as
white
as
snow
,
and
such
walls
and
towers
as
were
left
standing
were
so
damaged
that
their
instant
fall
was
to
be
expected
.
<EOS>
The
very
water
in
the
wells
and
fountains
was
boiling
,
and
even
the
muddy
Fleet
sent
forth
a
hot
steam
.
<EOS>
The
fire
still
lingered
in
the
lower
parts
of
many
habitations
,
especially
where
wine
,
spirits
,
or
inflammable
goods
had
been
kept
;
and
these
"
voragos
of
subterranean
cellars
,
"
<EOS>
as
Evelyn
terms
them
,
still
emitted
flames
,
together
with
a
prodigious
smoke
and
stench
.
<EOS>
Undismayed
by
the
dangers
of
the
path
he
had
to
traverse
,
the
young
man
ascended
Ludgate
-
hill
,
still
encountering
the
same
devastation
,
and
passing
through
the
ruined
gateway
,
the
end
of
which
remained
perfect
,
approached
what
had
once
been
Saint
Paul
's
Cathedral
.
<EOS>
Mounting
a
heap
of
rubbish
at
the
end
of
Ludgate
street
,
he
gazed
at
the
mighty
ruin
,
which
looked
more
like
the
remains
of
a
city
than
those
of
a
single
edifice
.
 
<EOS>
The
solid
walls
and
buttresses
were
split
and
rent
asunder
;
enormous
stones
were
splintered
and
calcined
by
the
heat
;
and
vast
flakes
having
scaled
from
off
the
pillars
,
gave
them
a
hoary
and
almost
ghostly
appearance
.
<EOS>
Its
enormous
extent
was
now
for
the
first
time
clearly
seen
,
and
,
strange
to
say
it
looked
twice
as
large
in
ruins
as
when
entire
.
<EOS>
The
central
tower
was
still
standing
,
but
chipped
,
broken
,
and
calcined
,
like
the
rest
of
the
structure
,
by
the
vehement
heat
of
the
flames
.
<EOS>
Part
of
the
roof
,
in
its
fall
,
broke
through
the
solid
floor
of
the
choir
,
which
was
of
immense
thickness
,
into
Saint
Faith
's
,
and
destroyed
the
magazine
of
books
and
paper
deposited
there
by
the
booksellers
.
<EOS>
The
portico
,
erected
by
Inigo
Jones
,
and
which
found
so
much
favour
in
Evelyn
's
eyes
,
that
he
describes
it
as
"
comparable
to
any
in
Europe
,
"
and
particularly
deplores
its
loss
,
shared
the
fate
of
the
rest
of
the
building
--
<EOS>
the
only
part
left
uninjured
being
the
architrave
,
the
inscription
on
which
was
undefaced
.
 
<EOS>
Having
satiated
himself
with
this
sad
but
striking
prospect
,
the
young
man
,
with
some
toil
and
trouble
,
crossed
the
churchyard
,
and
gained
Cheapside
,
where
a
yet
more
terrific
scene
of
devastation
than
that
which
he
had
previously
witnessed
burst
upon
him
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
of
London
Bridge
,
which
he
could
discern
through
the
chasms
of
the
houses
,
and
almost
to
the
Tower
,
were
nothing
but
ruins
,
while
a
similar
waste
lay
on
the
left
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
terrible
change
that
had
been
wrought
in
the
aspect
of
the
ruined
city
,
that
if
the
young
man
had
not
had
some
marks
to
guide
him
,
he
would
not
have
known
where
he
was
.
<EOS>
The
tower
and
ruined
walls
of
Saint
Peter
's
Church
pointed
out
to
him
the
entrance
to
Wood
-
street
,
and
,
entering
it
,
he
traversed
it
with
considerable
difficulty
--
for
the
narrow
thoroughfares
were
much
fuller
of
rubbish
,
and
much
less
freed
from
smoke
and
fiery
vapour
,
than
the
wider
--
until
he
reached
a
part
of
it
with
which
he
had
once
been
well
acquainted
.
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
how
changed
was
that
familiar
spot
.
<EOS>
The
house
he
sought
was
a
mere
heap
of
ruins
.
<EOS>
While
gazing
at
them
,
he
heard
a
voice
behind
him
,
and
turning
,
beheld
Mr.
Bloundel
and
his
son
Stephen
,
forcing
their
way
through
what
had
once
been
Maiden
-
lane
.
<EOS>
A
warm
greeting
passed
between
them
,
and
Mr.
Bloundel
gazed
for
some
time
in
silence
upon
the
wreck
of
his
dwelling
.
<EOS>
Tears
forced
themselves
into
his
eyes
,
and
his
companions
were
no
less
moved
.
<EOS>
As
he
turned
to
depart
,
he
observed
to
the
young
man
with
some
severity
:
 
<EOS>
"
How
is
it
,
Leonard
,
that
I
see
you
in
this
gay
apparel
?
<EOS>
Surely
,
the
present
is
not
a
fitting
season
for
such
idle
display
.
"
 
<EOS>
Lord
Argentine
,
for
such
it
was
,
now
explained
to
the
wonder
-
stricken
grocer
all
that
had
occurred
to
him
,
adding
that
he
had
intended
coming
to
him
that
very
day
,
if
he
had
not
been
thus
anticipated
,
to
give
him
the
present
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
where
are
Farmer
Wingfield
and
Blaize
?
"
asked
Mr.
Bloundel
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
extremely
uneasy
at
your
prolonged
absence
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
both
at
the
palace
,
"
replied
Lord
Argentine
,
"
and
have
both
been
laid
up
with
slight
injuries
received
during
the
conflagration
;
but
I
believe
--
nay
,
I
am
sure
--
they
will
get
out
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
well
,
"
replied
Mr.
Bloundel
;
"
and
now
let
me
congratulate
you
,
Leonard
--
that
is
,
my
lord
--
how
strange
such
a
title
sounds!--on
your
new
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
accept
my
congratulations
,
too
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Stephen
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
do
not
style
me
thus
,
"
said
Argentine
.
<EOS>
"
With
you
,
at
least
,
let
me
be
ever
Leonard
Holt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
still
my
old
apprentice
<EOS>
,
I
see
,
"
cried
the
grocer
,
warmly
grasping
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
such
I
shall
ever
continue
in
feeling
,
"
returned
the
other
,
cordially
returning
the
pressure
.
 
<EOS>
Three
days
after
this
,
Lord
Argentine
was
united
to
the
Lady
<EOS>
Isabella.--the
king
,
as
he
had
promised
,
giving
away
the
bride
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Rochester
was
present
,
together
with
the
grocer
and
his
wife
,
and
the
whole
of
their
family
.
<EOS>
Another
marriage
also
took
place
on
the
same
day
between
Blaize
and
Patience
.
<EOS>
Both
unions
,
it
is
satisfactory
to
be
able
to
state
,
were
extremely
happy
,
though
it
would
be
uncandid
not
to
mention
,
that
in
the
latter
case
,
to
use
a
homely
but
expressive
phrase
,
"
the
grey
mare
proved
the
better
horse
.
<EOS>
"
Blaize
,
however
,
was
exceedingly
content
under
his
government
.
<EOS>
He
settled
at
Willesden
with
his
wife
,
where
they
lived
to
a
good
old
age
,
and
where
some
of
his
descendants
may
still
be
found
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloundel
sustained
only
a
trifling
loss
by
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Another
house
was
erected
on
the
site
of
the
old
habitation
,
where
he
carried
on
his
business
as
respectably
and
as
profitably
as
before
,
until
,
in
the
course
of
nature
,
he
was
gathered
to
his
fathers
,
and
succeeded
by
his
son
Stephen
,
leaving
an
unblemished
character
behind
him
as
a
legacy
to
his
family
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
his
only
legacy
,
in
a
worldly
sense
,
for
his
time
had
not
been
misspent
,
and
he
had
well
-
husbanded
his
money
.
<EOS>
All
his
family
turned
out
well
,
and
were
successful
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Stephen
rose
to
the
highest
civic
dignities
,
and
the
younger
obtained
great
distinction
.
<EOS>
Their
daughter
Christiana
became
Lady
Argentine
,
being
wedded
to
the
eldest
son
of
the
baron
and
baroness
.
 
<EOS>
Mike
Macascree
,
the
piper
,
and
Bell
,
found
a
happy
asylum
with
the
same
noble
family
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Lord
and
Lady
Argentine
,
theirs
was
a
life
of
uninterrupted
happiness
.
<EOS>
Devotedly
attached
to
her
lord
,
the
Lady
Isabella
seemed
only
to
live
for
him
,
and
he
well
repaid
her
affection
.
<EOS>
By
sedulously
cultivating
his
talents
and
powers
,
which
were
considerable
,
he
was
enabled
to
reflect
credit
upon
the
high
rank
to
which
it
had
pleased
a
grateful
sovereign
to
elevate
him
.
<EOS>
He
lived
to
see
the
new
cathedral
completed
by
Sir
Christopher
Wren
,
and
often
visited
it
with
feelings
of
admiration
,
but
never
with
the
same
sentiments
of
veneration
and
awe
that
he
had
experienced
when
,
in
times
long
gone
by
,
he
had
repaired
to
OLD
SAINT
PAUL'S.
