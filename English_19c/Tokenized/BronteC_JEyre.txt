There
was
no
possibility
of
taking
a
walk
that
day
.
<EOS>
We
had
been
wandering
,
indeed
,
in
the
leafless
shrubbery
an
hour
in
the
morning
;
but
since
dinner
(
Mrs.
Reed
,
when
there
was
no
company
,
dined
early
)
<EOS>
the
cold
winter
wind
had
brought
with
it
clouds
so
sombre
,
and
a
rain
<EOS>
so
penetrating
,
that
further
out
-
door
exercise
was
now
out
of
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
glad
of
it
:
I
never
liked
long
walks
,
especially
on
chilly
afternoons
:
<EOS>
dreadful
to
me
was
the
coming
home
in
the
raw
twilight
,
with
nipped
fingers
and
toes
,
and
a
heart
saddened
by
the
chidings
of
Bessie
,
the
nurse
,
and
humbled
by
the
consciousness
of
my
physical
inferiority
to
Eliza
,
John
,
and
Georgiana
Reed
.
  
<EOS>
The
said
Eliza
,
John
,
and
Georgiana
were
now
clustered
<EOS>
round
their
mama
in
the
drawing
-
room
<EOS>
:
she
lay
reclined
on
a
sofa
by
the
fireside
,
and
with
her
darlings
about
her
(
for
the
time
neither
quarrelling
nor
crying
)
looked
perfectly
happy
.
<EOS>
Me
,
she
had
dispensed
from
joining
the
group
;
saying
,
"
She
regretted
to
be
under
the
necessity
of
keeping
me
at
a
distance
;
but
that
until
she
heard
from
Bessie
,
and
could
discover
by
her
own
observation
,
that
I
was
endeavouring
in
good
earnest
to
acquire
a
more
sociable
and
childlike
disposition
,
a
more
attractive
and
sprightly
manner
 
something
lighter
,
franker
,
more
natural
,
as
it
were
 
she
really
must
exclude
me
from
privileges
intended
only
for
contented
,
happy
,
little
children
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
Bessie
say
I
have
done
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
I
do
n't
like
cavillers
or
questioners
;
besides
,
there
is
something
truly
forbidding
in
a
child
taking
up
her
elders
in
that
manner
.
<EOS>
Be
seated
somewhere
;
and
until
you
can
speak
pleasantly
,
remain
silent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
breakfast
-
room
adjoined
the
drawing
-
room
,
I
slipped
in
there
.
<EOS>
It
contained
a
bookcase
:
I
soon
possessed
myself
of
a
volume
,
taking
care
that
it
should
be
one
stored
with
pictures
.
<EOS>
I
mounted
into
the
window-
seat
:
gathering
up
my
feet
<EOS>
,
I
sat
cross
-
legged
,
like
a
Turk
;
and
,
having
drawn
the
red
moreen
curtain
nearly
close
,
I
was
shrined
in
double
retirement
.
  
<EOS>
Folds
of
scarlet
drapery
shut
in
my
view
to
the
right
hand
;
to
the
left
were
the
clear
panes
of
glass
,
protecting
,
but
not
separating
me
from
the
drear
November
day
.
<EOS>
At
intervals
,
while
turning
over
the
leaves
of
my
book
,
I
studied
the
aspect
of
that
winter
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Afar
,
it
offered
a
pale
blank
of
mist
and
cloud
;
near
a
scene
of
wet
lawn
and
storm
-
beat
shrub
,
with
ceaseless
rain
sweeping
away
wildly
before
a
long
and
lamentable
blast
.
  
<EOS>
I
returned
to
my
book
 
Bewick
's
History
of
British
Birds
:
the
letterpress
thereof
I
cared
little
for
,
generally
speaking
;
and
yet
there
were
certain
introductory
pages
that
,
child
as
I
was
,
I
could
not
pass
quite
as
a
blank
.
<EOS>
They
were
those
which
treat
of
the
haunts
of
sea
-
fowl
;
of
"
the
solitary
rocks
and
promontories
"
by
them
only
inhabited
;
of
the
coast
of
Norway
,
studded
with
isles
from
its
southern
extremity
,
the
Lindeness
,
or
Naze
,
to
the
North
Cape
    
"
Where
the
Northern
Ocean
,
in
vast
whirls
,
Boils
round
the
naked
,
melancholy
isles
Of
farthest
Thule
;
and
the
Atlantic
surge
Pours
in
among
the
stormy
Hebrides
.
"
  
<EOS>
Nor
could
I
pass
unnoticed
the
suggestion
of
the
bleak
shores
of
Lapland
,
Siberia
,
Spitzbergen
,
Nova
Zembla
,
Iceland
,
Greenland
,
with
"
the
vast
sweep
of
the
Arctic
Zone
,
and
those
forlorn
regions
of
dreary
space
,
 
that
reservoir
of
frost
and
snow
,
where
firm
fields
of
ice
,
the
accumulation
of
centuries
of
winters
,
glazed
in
Alpine
heights
above
heights
,
surround
the
pole
,
and
concentre
the
multiplied
rigours
of
extreme
cold
.
<EOS>
"
Of
these
death
-
white
realms
I
formed
an
idea
of
my
own
:
shadowy
,
like
all
the
half
-
comprehended
notions
that
float
dim
through
children
's
brains
,
but
strangely
impressive
.
<EOS>
The
words
in
these
introductory
pages
connected
themselves
with
the
succeeding
vignettes
,
and
gave
significance
to
the
rock
standing
up
alone
in
a
sea
of
billow
and
spray
;
to
the
broken
boat
stranded
on
a
desolate
coast
;
to
the
cold
and
ghastly
moon
glancing
through
bars
of
cloud
at
a
wreck
just
sinking
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
what
sentiment
haunted
the
quite
solitary
churchyard
,
with
its
inscribed
headstone
;
its
gate
,
its
two
trees
,
its
low
horizon
,
girdled
by
a
broken
wall
,
and
its
newly
-
risen
crescent
,
attesting
the
hour
of
eventide
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
ships
becalmed
on
a
torpid
sea
,
I
believed
to
be
marine
phantoms
.
  
<EOS>
The
fiend
pinning
down
the
thief
's
pack
behind
him
<EOS>
,
I
passed
over
quickly
:
it
was
an
object
of
terror
.
  
<EOS>
So
was
the
black
horned
thing
seated
aloof
on
a
rock
,
surveying
a
distant
crowd
surrounding
a
gallows
.
  
<EOS>
Each
picture
told
a
story
;
mysterious
often
to
my
undeveloped
understanding
and
imperfect
feelings
,
yet
ever
profoundly
interesting
:
as
interesting
as
the
tales
<EOS>
Bessie
sometimes
narrated
on
winter
evenings
,
when
she
chanced
to
be
in
good
humour
;
and
when
,
having
brought
her
ironing
-
table
to
the
nursery
hearth
,
she
allowed
us
to
sit
about
it
,
and
while
she
got
up
Mrs.
Reed
's
lace
frills
,
and
crimped
her
nightcap
borders
,
fed
our
eager
attention
with
passages
of
love
and
adventure
taken
from
old
fairy
tales
and
other
ballads
;
or
(
as
at
a
later
period
I
discovered
)
from
the
pages
of
Pamela
,
and
Henry
,
Earl
of
Moreland
.
  
<EOS>
With
Bewick
on
my
knee
,
I
was
then
happy
:
happy
at
least
in
my
way
.
<EOS>
I
feared
nothing
but
interruption
,
and
that
came
too
soon
.
<EOS>
The
breakfast-
room
door
opened
.
  
<EOS>
"
Boh
!
Madam
Mope
!
"
cried
the
voice
of
John
Reed
;
then
he
paused
:
he
found
the
room
apparently
empty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
the
dickens
is
she
!
"
<EOS>
he
continued
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzy
!
<EOS>
Georgy
!
<EOS>
(
calling
to
his
sisters
)
<EOS>
Joan
is
not
here
:
tell
mama
she
is
run
out
into
the
rain
 
<EOS>
bad
animal
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
well
<EOS>
I
drew
the
curtain
,
"
thought
I
;
and
I
wished
fervently
he
might
not
discover
my
hiding
-
place
:
nor
would
John
Reed
have
found
it
out
himself
;
he
was
not
quick
either
of
vision
or
conception
;
but
Eliza
just
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
,
and
said
at
once
    
"
<EOS>
She
is
in
the
window
-
seat
,
to
be
sure
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
I
came
out
immediately
,
for
I
trembled
at
the
idea
of
being
dragged
forth
by
the
said
Jack
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
with
awkward
diffidence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
,
"
What
do
you
want
,
Master
Reed
?
"
<EOS>
"
was
the
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
come
here
;
"
and
seating
himself
in
an
arm
-
chair
,
he
intimated
by
a
gesture
that
I
was
to
approach
and
stand
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
John
Reed
was
a
schoolboy
of
fourteen
years
old
;
four
years
older
than
I
,
for
I
was
but
ten
:
large
and
stout
for
his
age
,
with
a
dingy
and
unwholesome
skin
;
thick
lineaments
in
a
spacious
visage
,
heavy
limbs
and
large
extremities
.
<EOS>
He
gorged
himself
habitually
at
table
,
which
made
him
bilious
,
and
gave
him
a
dim
and
bleared
eye
and
flabby
cheeks
.
<EOS>
He
ought
now
to
have
been
at
school
;
but
his
mama
had
taken
him
home
for
a
month
or
two
,
"
on
account
of
his
delicate
health
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Miles
,
the
master
,
affirmed
that
he
would
do
very
well
if
he
had
fewer
cakes
and
sweetmeats
sent
him
from
home
;
but
the
mother
's
heart
turned
from
an
opinion
so
harsh
,
and
inclined
rather
to
the
more
refined
idea
that
John
's
sallowness
was
owing
to
over
-
application
and
,
perhaps
,
to
pining
after
home
.
  
<EOS>
John
had
not
much
affection
for
his
mother
and
sisters
,
and
an
antipathy
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
bullied
and
punished
me
;
not
two
or
three
times
in
the
week
,
nor
once
or
twice
in
the
day
,
but
continually
:
every
nerve
I
had
feared
him
,
and
every
morsel
of
flesh
in
my
bones
shrank
when
he
came
near
.
<EOS>
There
were
moments
when
I
was
bewildered
by
the
terror
he
inspired
,
because
I
had
no
appeal
<EOS>
whatever
against
either
his
menaces
or
his
inflictions
;
the
servants
did
not
like
to
offend
their
young
master
by
taking
my
part
against
him
,
and
Mrs.
Reed
was
blind
and
deaf
on
the
subject
:
she
never
saw
him
strike
or
heard
him
abuse
me
,
though
he
did
both
now
and
then
in
her
very
presence
,
more
frequently
,
however
,
behind
her
back
.
  
<EOS>
Habitually
obedient
to
John
,
I
came
up
to
his
chair
:
he
spent
some
three
minutes
in
thrusting
out
his
tongue
at
me
as
far
as
he
could
without
damaging
the
roots
:
<EOS>
I
knew
he
would
soon
strike
,
and
while
dreading
the
blow
,
I
mused
on
the
disgusting
and
ugly
appearance
of
him
who
would
presently
deal
it
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
he
read
that
notion
in
my
face
;
for
,
all
at
once
,
without
speaking
,
he
struck
suddenly
and
strongly
.
<EOS>
I
tottered
,
and
on
regaining
my
equilibrium
retired
back
a
step
or
two
from
his
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
for
your
impudence
in
answering
mama
awhile
since
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
for
your
sneaking
way
of
getting
behind
curtains
,
and
for
the
look
you
had
in
your
eyes
two
minutes
since
,
you
rat
!
"
  
<EOS>
Accustomed
to
John
Reed
's
abuse
,
I
never
had
an
idea
of
replying
to
it
;
my
care
was
how
to
endure
the
blow
which
would
certainly
follow
the
insult
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
were
you
doing
behind
the
curtain
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
reading
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Show
the
book
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
returned
to
the
window
and
fetched
it
thence
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
business
to
take
our
books
;
you
are
a
dependent
<EOS>
,
mama
says
;
you
have
no
money
;
your
father
left
you
none
;
you
ought
to
beg
,
and
not
to
live
here
with
gentlemen
's
children
like
us
,
and
eat
the
same
meals
we
do
,
and
wear
clothes
at
our
mama
's
expense
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
'll
teach
you
to
rummage
my
bookshelves
:
for
they
_
are
_
mine
;
all
the
house
belongs
to
me
,
or
will
do
in
a
few
years
.
<EOS>
Go
and
stand
by
the
door
,
out
of
the
way
of
the
mirror
and
the
windows
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
so
,
not
at
first
aware
what
was
his
intention
;
but
when
I
saw
him
lift
and
poise
the
book
and
stand
in
act
to
hurl
it
,
I
instinctively
started
aside
with
a
cry
of
alarm
:
not
soon
enough
,
however
;
the
volume
was
flung
,
it
hit
me
,
and
I
fell
,
striking
my
head
against
the
door
and
cutting
it
.
<EOS>
The
cut
bled
,
the
pain
was
sharp
:
my
terror
had
passed
its
climax
;
other
feelings
succeeded
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wicked
and
cruel
boy
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
like
a
murderer
 
<EOS>
you
are
like
a
slave
-
driver
 
<EOS>
you
are
like
the
Roman
emperors
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
read
Goldsmith
's
History
of
Rome
,
and
had
formed
my
opinion
of
Nero
,
Caligula
,
etc
.
<EOS>
Also
I
had
drawn
parallels
in
silence
,
which
I
never
thought
thus
to
have
declared
aloud
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
she
say
that
to
me
?
<EOS>
Did
you
hear
her
,
Eliza
and
Georgiana
?
<EOS>
Wo
n't
I
tell
mama
?
<EOS>
but
first
 
"
  
He
ran
headlong
at
me
:
I
felt
him
grasp
my
hair
and
my
shoulder
:
he
had
closed
with
a
desperate
thing
.
<EOS>
I
really
saw
in
him
a
tyrant
,
a
murderer
.
<EOS>
I
felt
a
drop
or
two
of
blood
from
my
head
trickle
down
my
neck
,
and
was
sensible
of
somewhat
pungent
suffering
:
these
sensations
for
the
time
predominated
over
fear
,
and
I
received
him
in
frantic
sort
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
very
well
know
what
I
did
with
my
hands
,
but
he
called
me
"
Rat
!
Rat
!
"
and
bellowed
out
aloud
.
<EOS>
Aid
was
near
him
:
<EOS>
Eliza
and
Georgiana
had
run
for
Mrs.
Reed
,
who
was
gone
upstairs
:
she
now
came
upon
the
scene
,
followed
by
Bessie
and
her
maid
Abbot
.
<EOS>
We
were
parted
:
I
heard
the
words
    
"
Dear
!
<EOS>
dear
!
<EOS>
What
a
fury
to
fly
at
Master
John
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
ever
anybody
see
such
a
picture
of
passion
!
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Mrs.
Reed
subjoined
    
<EOS>
"
Take
her
away
to
the
red
-
room
,
and
lock
her
in
there
.
"
<EOS>
Four
hands
were
immediately
laid
upon
me
,
and
I
was
borne
upstairs
.
    
<EOS>
I
resisted
all
the
way
:
a
new
thing
for
me
,
and
a
circumstance
which
greatly
strengthened
the
bad
opinion
Bessie
and
Miss
Abbot
were
disposed
to
entertain
of
me
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
I
was
a
trifle
beside
myself
;
or
rather
_
out
<EOS>
_
of
myself
,
as
the
French
would
say
:
I
was
conscious
that
a
moment
's
mutiny
had
already
rendered
me
liable
to
strange
penalties
,
and
,
like
any
other
rebel
slave
<EOS>
,
I
felt
resolved
,
in
my
desperation
,
to
go
all
lengths
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hold
her
arms
,
Miss
Abbot
:
she
's
like
a
mad
cat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
shame
!
<EOS>
for
shame
!
"
cried
the
lady's
-
maid
.
<EOS>
"
What
shocking
conduct
,
Miss
Eyre
,
to
strike
a
young
gentleman
,
your
benefactress
's
son
!
<EOS>
Your
young
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Master
!
<EOS>
How
is
he
my
master
?
<EOS>
Am
I
a
servant
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
you
are
less
than
a
servant
,
for
you
do
nothing
for
your
keep
.
<EOS>
There
,
sit
down
,
and
think
over
your
wickedness
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
had
got
me
by
this
time
into
the
apartment
indicated
by
Mrs.
Reed
,
and
had
thrust
me
upon
a
stool
:
<EOS>
my
impulse
was
to
rise
from
it
like
a
spring
;
their
two
pair
of
hands
arrested
me
instantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
sit
still
,
you
must
be
tied
down
,
"
said
Bessie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Miss
Abbot
,
lend
me
your
garters
;
she
would
break
mine
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Abbot
turned
to
divest
a
stout
leg
of
the
necessary
ligature
.
<EOS>
This
preparation
for
bonds
,
and
the
additional
ignominy
it
inferred
,
took
a
little
of
the
excitement
out
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
take
them
off
,
"
I
cried
;
"
I
will
not
stir
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
guarantee
whereof
,
I
attached
myself
to
my
seat
by
my
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mind
you
do
n't
,
"
said
Bessie
;
and
when
she
had
ascertained
that
I
was
really
subsiding
,
she
loosened
her
hold
of
me
;
then
she
and
Miss
Abbot
stood
with
folded
arms
,
looking
darkly
and
doubtfully
on
my
face
,
as
incredulous
of
my
sanity
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
never
did
so
before
,
"
<EOS>
at
last
said
Bessie
,
turning
to
the
Abigail
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
was
always
in
her
,
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
told
Missis
often
my
opinion
about
the
child
,
and
Missis
agreed
with
me
.
<EOS>
She
's
an
underhand
little
thing
<EOS>
:
I
never
saw
a
girl
of
her
age
with
so
much
cover
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bessie
answered
not
;
but
<EOS>
ere
long
,
addressing
me
,
she
said
 
"
You
ought
to
be
aware
,
Miss
,
that
you
are
under
obligations
to
Mrs.
Reed
<EOS>
:
she
keeps
you
:
if
she
were
to
turn
you
off
,
you
would
have
to
go
to
the
poorhouse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
nothing
to
say
to
these
words
:
they
were
not
new
to
me
:
<EOS>
my
very
first
recollections
of
existence
included
hints
of
the
same
kind
.
<EOS>
This
reproach
of
my
dependence
had
become
a
vague
sing
-
song
in
my
ear
:
very
painful
and
crushing
,
but
only
half
intelligible
.
<EOS>
Miss
Abbot
joined
in
    
"
<EOS>
And
you
ought
not
to
think
yourself
on
an
equality
with
the
Misses
Reed
and
Master
Reed
,
because
Missis
kindly
allows
you
to
be
brought
up
with
them
.
<EOS>
They
will
have
a
great
deal
of
money
,
and
you
will
have
none
:
it
is
your
place
to
be
humble
,
and
to
try
to
make
yourself
agreeable
to
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
we
tell
you
is
for
your
good
,
"
added
Bessie
,
in
no
harsh
voice
,
"
you
should
try
to
be
useful
and
pleasant
,
then
,
perhaps
,
you
would
have
a
home
here
;
but
if
you
become
passionate
and
rude
,
Missis
will
send
you
away
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
"
said
Miss
Abbot
,
"
God
will
punish
her
:
He
might
strike
her
dead
in
the
midst
of
her
tantrums
,
and
then
where
would
she
go
?
<EOS>
Come
,
Bessie
<EOS>
,
we
will
leave
her
:
I
would
n't
have
her
heart
for
anything
.
<EOS>
Say
your
prayers
,
Miss
Eyre
,
when
you
are
by
yourself
;
for
if
you
do
n't
repent
,
something
bad
might
be
permitted
to
come
down
the
chimney
and
fetch
you
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
went
,
shutting
the
door
,
and
locking
it
behind
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
red
-
room
was
a
square
chamber
,
very
seldom
slept
in
<EOS>
,
I
might
say
never
,
indeed
,
unless
when
a
chance
influx
of
visitors
at
Gateshead
Hall
rendered
it
necessary
to
turn
to
account
all
the
accommodation
it
contained
:
yet
it
was
one
of
the
largest
and
stateliest
chambers
in
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
A
bed
supported
on
massive
pillars
of
mahogany
,
hung
with
curtains
of
deep
red
damask
,
stood
out
like
a
tabernacle
in
the
centre
;
the
two
large
windows
,
with
their
blinds
always
drawn
down
,
were
half
shrouded
in
festoons
and
falls
of
similar
drapery
;
the
carpet
was
red
;
the
table
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
was
covered
with
a
crimson
cloth
;
the
walls
were
a
soft
fawn
colour
with
a
blush
of
pink
in
it
;
the
wardrobe
,
the
toilet
-
table
,
the
chairs
were
of
darkly
polished
old
mahogany
.
<EOS>
Out
of
these
deep
surrounding
shades
rose
high
,
and
glared
white
,
the
piled-
up
mattresses
and
pillows
of
the
bed
,
spread
with
a
snowy
Marseilles
counterpane
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
less
prominent
was
an
ample
cushioned
easy
-
chair
near
the
head
of
the
bed
,
also
white
,
with
a
footstool
before
it
;
and
looking
,
as
I
thought
,
like
a
pale
throne
.
  
<EOS>
This
room
was
chill
,
because
it
seldom
had
a
fire
;
it
was
silent
,
because
remote
from
the
nursery
and
kitchen
<EOS>
;
solemn
,
because
it
was
known
to
be
so
seldom
entered
.
<EOS>
The
house
-
maid
alone
came
here
on
Saturdays
,
to
wipe
from
the
mirrors
and
the
furniture
a
week
's
quiet
dust
:
and
Mrs.
Reed
herself
,
at
far
intervals
,
visited
it
to
review
the
contents
of
a
certain
secret
drawer
in
the
wardrobe
,
where
were
stored
divers
parchments
,
her
jewel
-
casket
,
and
a
miniature
of
her
deceased
husband
;
and
in
those
last
words
lies
the
secret
of
the
red
-
room
 
the
spell
which
kept
it
so
lonely
in
spite
of
its
grandeur
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Reed
had
been
dead
nine
years
<EOS>
:
it
was
in
this
chamber
he
breathed
his
last
;
here
he
lay
in
state
;
hence
his
coffin
was
borne
by
the
undertaker
's
men
;
and
,
since
that
day
,
a
sense
of
dreary
consecration
had
guarded
it
from
frequent
intrusion
.
  
<EOS>
My
seat
,
to
which
Bessie
and
the
bitter
Miss
Abbot
had
left
me
riveted
,
was
a
low
ottoman
near
the
marble
chimney
-
piece
;
the
bed
rose
before
me
;
to
my
right
hand
there
was
the
high
,
dark
wardrobe
,
with
subdued
,
broken
reflections
varying
the
gloss
of
its
panels
;
to
my
left
were
the
muffled
windows
;
a
great
looking
-
glass
between
them
repeated
the
vacant
majesty
of
the
bed
and
room
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
quite
sure
whether
they
had
locked
the
door
;
and
when
I
dared
move
,
I
got
up
and
went
to
see
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
yes
:
no
jail
was
ever
more
secure
.
<EOS>
Returning
,
I
had
to
cross
before
the
looking-
glass
;
my
fascinated
glance
involuntarily
explored
the
depth
it
revealed
.
<EOS>
All
looked
colder
and
darker
in
that
visionary
hollow
than
in
reality
:
and
the
strange
little
figure
there
gazing
at
me
,
with
a
white
face
and
arms
specking
the
gloom
,
and
glittering
eyes
of
fear
moving
where
all
else
was
still
,
had
the
effect
of
a
real
spirit
:
I
thought
it
like
one
of
the
tiny
phantoms
,
half
fairy
,
half
imp
,
Bessie
's
evening
stories
represented
as
coming
out
of
lone
,
ferny
dells
in
moors
,
and
appearing
before
the
eyes
of
belated
travellers
.
<EOS>
I
returned
to
my
stool
.
  
<EOS>
Superstition
was
with
me
at
that
moment
;
but
it
was
not
yet
her
hour
for
complete
victory
:
my
blood
was
still
warm
;
the
mood
of
the
revolted
slave
was
still
bracing
me
with
its
bitter
vigour
;
I
had
to
stem
a
rapid
rush
of
retrospective
thought
before
I
quailed
to
the
dismal
present
.
  
<EOS>
All
John
Reed
's
violent
tyrannies
,
all
his
sisters
'
proud
indifference
,
all
his
mother
's
aversion
,
all
the
servants
'
partiality
,
turned
up
in
my
disturbed
mind
like
a
dark
deposit
in
a
turbid
well
.
<EOS>
Why
was
I
always
suffering
,
always
browbeaten
,
always
accused
,
for
ever
condemned
?
<EOS>
Why
could
I
never
please
?
<EOS>
Why
was
it
useless
to
try
to
win
any
one
's
favour
?
<EOS>
Eliza
,
who
was
headstrong
and
selfish
,
was
respected
.
<EOS>
Georgiana
,
who
had
a
spoiled
temper
,
a
very
acrid
spite
,
a
captious
and
insolent
carriage
,
was
universally
indulged
.
<EOS>
Her
beauty
,
her
pink
cheeks
and
golden
curls
,
seemed
to
give
delight
to
all
who
looked
at
her
,
and
to
purchase
indemnity
for
every
fault
.
<EOS>
John
no
one
thwarted
,
much
less
punished
;
though
he
twisted
the
necks
of
the
pigeons
,
killed
the
little
pea
-
chicks
,
set
the
dogs
at
the
sheep
,
stripped
the
hothouse
vines
of
their
fruit
,
and
broke
the
buds
off
the
choicest
plants
in
the
conservatory
:
he
called
his
mother
"
old
girl
,
"
too
;
sometimes
reviled
her
for
her
dark
skin
,
similar
to
his
own
;
bluntly
disregarded
her
wishes
;
not
unfrequently
tore
and
spoiled
her
silk
attire
;
and
he
was
still
"
her
own
darling
.
<EOS>
"
I
dared
commit
no
fault
:
I
strove
to
fulfil
every
duty
;
and
I
was
termed
naughty
and
tiresome
,
sullen
and
sneaking
,
from
morning
to
noon
,
and
from
noon
to
night
.
  
<EOS>
My
head
still
ached
and
bled
with
the
blow
and
fall
<EOS>
I
had
received
:
no
one
had
reproved
John
for
wantonly
striking
me
;
and
because
I
had
turned
against
him
to
avert
farther
irrational
violence
,
I
was
loaded
with
general
opprobrium
.
  
<EOS>
"
Unjust
!
 
<EOS>
unjust
!
"
said
my
reason
,
forced
by
the
agonising
stimulus
into
precocious
though
transitory
power
:
and
Resolve
,
equally
wrought
up
,
instigated
some
strange
expedient
to
achieve
escape
from
insupportable
oppression
 
as
running
away
,
or
,
if
that
could
not
be
effected
,
never
eating
or
drinking
more
,
and
letting
myself
die
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
consternation
of
soul
was
mine
that
dreary
afternoon
!
<EOS>
How
all
my
brain
was
in
tumult
,
and
all
my
heart
in
insurrection
!
<EOS>
Yet
in
what
darkness
,
what
dense
ignorance
,
was
the
mental
battle
fought
!
<EOS>
I
could
not
answer
the
ceaseless
inward
question
 
_
<EOS>
why
_
I
thus
suffered
;
now
,
at
the
distance
of
 
I
will
not
say
how
many
years
,
I
see
it
clearly
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
a
discord
in
Gateshead
Hall
<EOS>
:
I
was
like
nobody
there
;
I
had
nothing
in
harmony
with
Mrs.
Reed
or
her
children
,
or
her
chosen
vassalage
.
<EOS>
If
they
did
not
love
me
,
in
fact
,
as
little
did
I
love
them
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
bound
to
regard
with
affection
a
thing
that
could
not
sympathise
with
one
amongst
them
;
a
heterogeneous
thing
,
opposed
to
them
in
temperament
,
in
capacity
,
in
propensities
;
a
useless
thing
,
incapable
of
serving
their
interest
,
or
adding
to
their
pleasure
;
a
noxious
thing
,
cherishing
the
germs
of
indignation
at
their
treatment
,
of
contempt
of
their
judgment
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
had
I
been
a
sanguine
,
brilliant
,
careless
,
exacting
,
handsome
,
romping
child
 
though
equally
dependent
and
friendless
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
would
have
endured
my
presence
more
complacently
;
her
children
would
have
entertained
for
me
more
of
the
cordiality
of
fellow
-
feeling
;
the
servants
would
have
been
less
prone
to
make
me
the
scapegoat
of
the
nursery
.
  
<EOS>
Daylight
began
to
forsake
the
red
-
room
;
it
was
past
four
o'clock
,
and
the
beclouded
afternoon
was
tending
to
drear
twilight
.
<EOS>
I
heard
the
rain
still
beating
continuously
on
the
staircase
window
,
and
the
wind
howling
in
the
grove
behind
the
hall
;
I
grew
by
degrees
cold
as
a
stone
,
and
then
my
courage
sank
.
<EOS>
My
habitual
mood
of
humiliation
,
self
-
doubt
,
forlorn
depression
,
fell
damp
on
the
embers
of
my
decaying
ire
.
<EOS>
All
said
I
was
wicked
,
and
perhaps
I
might
be
so
;
what
thought
had
I
been
but
just
conceiving
of
starving
myself
to
death
?
<EOS>
That
certainly
was
a
crime
:
and
was
I
fit
to
die
?
<EOS>
Or
was
the
vault
under
the
chancel
of
Gateshead
Church
an
inviting
bourne
?
<EOS>
In
such
vault
I
had
been
told
did
Mr.
Reed
lie
buried
;
and
led
by
this
thought
to
recall
his
idea
,
I
dwelt
on
it
with
gathering
dread
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
remember
him
;
but
I
knew
that
he
was
my
own
uncle
 
<EOS>
my
mother
's
brother
 
<EOS>
that
he
had
taken
me
when
a
parentless
infant
to
his
house
;
and
that
in
his
last
moments
he
had
required
a
promise
of
Mrs.
Reed
that
she
would
rear
and
maintain
me
as
one
of
her
own
children
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
probably
considered
she
had
kept
this
promise
;
and
so
she
had
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
as
well
as
her
nature
would
permit
her
;
but
how
could
she
really
like
an
interloper
not
of
her
race
,
and
unconnected
with
her
,
after
her
husband
's
death
,
by
any
tie
?
<EOS>
It
must
have
been
most
irksome
to
find
herself
bound
by
a
hard
-
wrung
pledge
to
stand
in
the
stead
of
a
parent
to
a
strange
child
she
could
not
love
,
and
to
see
an
uncongenial
alien
permanently
intruded
on
her
own
family
group
.
  
<EOS>
A
singular
notion
dawned
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
doubted
not
 
never
doubted
 
that
if
Mr.
Reed
had
been
alive
he
would
have
treated
me
kindly
;
and
now
,
as
I
sat
looking
at
the
white
bed
and
overshadowed
walls
 
occasionally
also
turning
a
fascinated
eye
towards
the
dimly
gleaning
mirror
 
<EOS>
I
began
to
recall
what
I
had
heard
of
dead
men
,
troubled
in
their
graves
by
the
violation
of
their
last
wishes
,
revisiting
the
earth
to
punish
the
perjured
and
avenge
the
oppressed
;
and
I
thought
Mr.
Reed
's
spirit
,
harassed
by
the
wrongs
of
his
sister
's
child
,
might
quit
its
abode
 
whether
in
the
church
vault
or
in
the
unknown
world
of
the
departed
 
and
rise
before
me
in
this
chamber
.
<EOS>
I
wiped
my
tears
and
hushed
my
sobs
,
fearful
lest
any
sign
of
violent
grief
might
waken
a
preternatural
voice
to
comfort
me
,
or
elicit
from
the
gloom
<EOS>
some
haloed
face
,
bending
over
me
with
strange
pity
.
<EOS>
This
idea
,
consolatory
in
theory
,
I
felt
would
be
terrible
if
realised
:
with
all
my
might
I
endeavoured
to
stifle
it
 
<EOS>
I
endeavoured
to
be
firm
.
<EOS>
Shaking
my
hair
from
my
eyes
,
I
lifted
my
head
and
tried
to
look
boldly
round
the
dark
room
;
at
this
moment
a
light
gleamed
on
the
wall
.
<EOS>
Was
it
,
I
asked
myself
,
a
ray
from
the
moon
penetrating
some
aperture
in
the
blind
?
<EOS>
No
;
moonlight
was
still
,
and
this
stirred
;
while
I
gazed
,
it
glided
up
to
the
ceiling
and
quivered
over
my
head
.
<EOS>
I
can
now
conjecture
readily
that
this
streak
of
light
was
,
in
all
likelihood
,
a
gleam
from
a
lantern
carried
by
some
one
across
the
lawn
:
but
then
,
prepared
as
my
mind
was
for
horror
,
shaken
as
my
nerves
were
by
agitation
,
I
thought
the
swift
darting
beam
was
a
herald
of
some
coming
vision
from
another
world
.
<EOS>
My
heart
beat
thick
,
my
head
grew
hot
;
a
sound
filled
my
ears
,
which
I
deemed
the
rushing
of
wings
;
something
seemed
near
me
;
I
was
oppressed
,
suffocated
:
<EOS>
endurance
broke
down
;
I
rushed
to
the
door
and
shook
the
lock
in
desperate
effort
.
<EOS>
Steps
came
running
along
the
outer
passage
;
the
key
turned
,
Bessie
and
Abbot
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Eyre
,
are
you
ill
?
"
said
Bessie
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
dreadful
noise
!
<EOS>
it
went
quite
through
me
!
"
exclaimed
Abbot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
me
out
!
<EOS>
Let
me
go
into
the
nursery
!
"
was
my
cry
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
for
?
<EOS>
Are
you
hurt
?
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
something
?
"
<EOS>
again
demanded
Bessie
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
saw
a
light
,
and
I
thought
a
ghost
would
come
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
now
got
hold
of
Bessie
's
hand
,
and
she
did
not
snatch
it
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
screamed
out
on
purpose
,
"
declared
Abbot
,
in
some
disgust
.
"
<EOS>
And
what
a
scream
!
<EOS>
If
she
had
been
in
great
pain
one
would
have
excused
it
,
but
she
only
wanted
to
bring
us
all
here
:
I
know
her
naughty
tricks
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
all
this
?
"
demanded
another
voice
peremptorily
;
and
Mrs.
Reed
came
along
the
corridor
,
her
cap
flying
wide
,
her
gown
rustling
stormily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Abbot
and
Bessie
<EOS>
,
I
believe
I
gave
orders
that
Jane
Eyre
should
be
left
in
the
red
-
room
till
I
came
to
her
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Miss
Jane
screamed
so
loud
,
ma'am
,
"
pleaded
Bessie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
her
go
,
"
was
the
only
answer
.
"
<EOS>
Loose
Bessie
's
hand
,
child
:
<EOS>
you
can
not
succeed
in
getting
out
by
these
means
,
be
assured
.
<EOS>
I
abhor
artifice
,
particularly
in
children
;
it
is
my
duty
to
show
you
that
tricks
will
not
answer
:
<EOS>
you
will
now
stay
here
an
hour
longer
,
and
it
is
only
on
condition
of
perfect
submission
and
stillness
that
I
shall
liberate
you
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
O
aunt
!
have
pity
!
<EOS>
Forgive
me
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
endure
it
 
<EOS>
let
me
be
punished
some
other
way
!
<EOS>
I
shall
be
killed
if
 
"
  
"
Silence
!
<EOS>
This
violence
is
all
most
repulsive
:
"
and
so
,
no
doubt
,
she
felt
it
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
precocious
actress
in
her
eyes
;
she
sincerely
looked
on
me
as
a
compound
of
virulent
passions
,
mean
spirit
,
and
dangerous
duplicity
.
  
<EOS>
Bessie
and
Abbot
having
retreated
,
Mrs.
Reed
,
impatient
of
my
now
frantic
anguish
and
wild
sobs
,
abruptly
thrust
me
back
and
locked
me
in
,
without
farther
parley
.
<EOS>
I
heard
her
sweeping
away
;
and
soon
after
she
was
gone
,
I
suppose
I
had
a
species
of
fit
:
unconsciousness
closed
the
scene
.
    
<EOS>
The
next
thing
I
remember
is
,
waking
up
with
a
feeling
as
if
I
had
had
a
frightful
nightmare
,
and
seeing
before
me
a
terrible
red
glare
,
crossed
with
thick
black
bars
.
<EOS>
I
heard
voices
,
too
,
speaking
with
a
hollow
sound
,
and
as
if
muffled
by
a
rush
of
wind
or
water
:
agitation
,
uncertainty
,
and
an
all
-
predominating
sense
of
terror
confused
my
faculties
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
I
became
aware
that
some
one
was
handling
me
;
lifting
me
up
and
supporting
me
in
a
sitting
posture
,
and
that
more
tenderly
than
I
had
ever
been
raised
or
upheld
before
.
<EOS>
I
rested
my
head
against
a
pillow
or
an
arm
,
and
felt
easy
.
  
<EOS>
In
five
minutes
more
the
cloud
of
bewilderment
dissolved
:
I
knew
quite
well
that
I
was
in
my
own
bed
,
and
that
the
red
glare
was
the
nursery
fire
.
<EOS>
It
was
night
:
a
candle
burnt
on
the
table
;
Bessie
stood
at
the
bed-
foot
with
a
basin
in
her
hand
,
and
a
gentleman
sat
in
a
chair
near
my
pillow
,
leaning
over
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
felt
an
inexpressible
relief
,
a
soothing
conviction
of
protection
and
security
,
when
I
knew
that
there
was
a
stranger
in
the
room
,
an
individual
not
belonging
to
Gateshead
,
and
not
related
to
Mrs.
Reed
.
<EOS>
Turning
from
Bessie
(
though
her
presence
was
far
less
obnoxious
to
me
than
that
of
Abbot
,
for
instance
,
would
have
been
)
,
I
scrutinised
the
face
of
the
gentleman
:
<EOS>
I
knew
him
;
it
was
Mr.
Lloyd
,
an
apothecary
,
sometimes
called
in
by
Mrs.
Reed
when
the
servants
were
ailing
:
for
herself
and
the
children
she
employed
a
physician
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
who
am
I
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
I
pronounced
his
name
,
offering
him
at
the
same
time
my
hand
<EOS>
:
he
took
it
,
smiling
and
saying
,
"
We
shall
do
very
well
by
-
and
-
by
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
laid
me
down
,
and
addressing
Bessie
,
charged
her
to
be
very
careful
that
I
was
not
disturbed
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
Having
given
some
further
directions
,
and
intimates
that
he
should
call
again
the
next
day
,
he
departed
;
to
my
grief
:
<EOS>
I
felt
so
sheltered
and
befriended
while
he
sat
in
the
chair
near
my
pillow
;
and
as
he
closed
the
door
after
him
,
all
the
room
darkened
and
my
heart
again
sank
:
inexpressible
sadness
weighed
it
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
feel
as
if
you
should
sleep
,
Miss
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Bessie
,
rather
softly
.
  
<EOS>
Scarcely
dared
I
answer
her
;
for
I
feared
the
next
sentence
might
be
rough
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
to
drink
,
or
could
you
eat
anything
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
,
Bessie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
think
I
shall
go
to
bed
,
<EOS>
for
it
is
past
twelve
o'clock
;
but
you
may
call
me
if
you
want
anything
in
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Wonderful
civility
this
!
<EOS>
It
emboldened
me
to
ask
a
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bessie
,
what
is
the
matter
with
me
?
<EOS>
Am
I
ill
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
fell
sick
,
I
suppose
,
in
the
red
-
room
with
crying
;
you
'll
be
better
soon
,
no
doubt
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bessie
went
into
the
housemaid
's
apartment
,
which
was
near
.
<EOS>
I
heard
her
say
    
<EOS>
"
Sarah
,
come
and
sleep
with
me
in
the
nursery
;
I
dare
n't
for
my
life
be
alone
with
that
poor
child
to
-
night
:
<EOS>
she
might
die
;
it
's
such
a
strange
thing
she
should
have
that
fit
:
I
wonder
if
she
saw
anything
.
<EOS>
Missis
was
rather
too
hard
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sarah
came
back
with
her
;
they
both
went
to
bed
;
they
were
whispering
together
for
half
-
an
-
hour
before
they
fell
asleep
.
<EOS>
I
caught
scraps
of
their
conversation
,
from
which
I
was
able
only
too
distinctly
to
infer
the
main
subject
discussed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Something
passed
her
,
all
dressed
in
white
,
and
vanished
"
 
"
A
great
black
dog
behind
him
"
 
"
Three
loud
raps
on
the
chamber
door
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
light
in
the
churchyard
just
over
his
grave
,
"
etc
.
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
both
slept
:
the
fire
and
the
candle
went
out
.
<EOS>
For
me
,
the
watches
of
that
long
night
passed
in
ghastly
wakefulness
;
strained
by
dread
:
such
dread
as
children
only
can
feel
.
  
<EOS>
No
severe
or
prolonged
bodily
illness
followed
this
incident
of
the
red-
room
;
it
only
gave
my
nerves
a
shock
of
which
I
feel
the
reverberation
to
this
day
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
Mrs.
Reed
,
to
you
<EOS>
I
owe
some
fearful
pangs
of
mental
suffering
,
but
I
ought
to
forgive
you
,
for
you
knew
not
what
you
did
:
while
rending
my
heart
-
strings
,
you
thought
you
were
only
uprooting
my
bad
propensities
.
  
<EOS>
Next
day
,
by
noon
,
I
was
up
and
dressed
,
and
sat
wrapped
in
a
shawl
by
the
nursery
hearth
.
<EOS>
I
felt
physically
weak
and
broken
down
:
but
my
worse
ailment
was
an
unutterable
wretchedness
of
mind
:
a
wretchedness
which
kept
drawing
from
me
silent
tears
;
no
sooner
had
I
wiped
one
salt
drop
from
my
cheek
than
another
followed
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
I
thought
,
I
ought
to
have
been
happy
,
for
none
of
the
Reeds
were
there
,
they
were
all
gone
out
in
the
carriage
with
their
mama
.
<EOS>
Abbot
,
too
,
was
sewing
in
another
room
,
and
Bessie
,
as
she
moved
hither
and
thither
,
putting
away
toys
and
arranging
drawers
,
<EOS>
addressed
to
me
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
word
of
unwonted
kindness
.
<EOS>
This
state
of
things
should
have
been
to
me
a
paradise
of
peace
,
accustomed
as
I
was
to
a
life
of
ceaseless
reprimand
and
thankless
fagging
;
but
,
in
fact
,
my
racked
nerves
were
now
in
such
a
state
that
no
calm
could
soothe
,
and
no
pleasure
excite
them
agreeably
.
  
<EOS>
Bessie
had
been
down
into
the
kitchen
,
and
she
brought
up
with
her
a
tart
on
a
certain
brightly
painted
china
plate
,
whose
bird
of
paradise
,
nestling
in
a
wreath
of
convolvuli
and
rosebuds
,
had
been
wo
nt
to
stir
in
me
a
most
enthusiastic
sense
of
admiration
;
and
<EOS>
which
plate
I
had
often
petitioned
to
be
allowed
to
take
in
my
hand
in
order
to
examine
it
more
closely
,
but
had
always
hitherto
been
deemed
unworthy
of
such
a
privilege
.
<EOS>
This
precious
vessel
was
now
placed
on
my
knee
,
and
I
was
cordially
invited
to
eat
the
circlet
of
delicate
pastry
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Vain
favour
!
<EOS>
coming
,
like
most
other
favours
long
deferred
and
often
wished
for
,
too
late
!
<EOS>
I
could
not
eat
the
tart
;
and
the
plumage
of
the
bird
,
the
tints
of
the
flowers
,
seemed
strangely
faded
:
I
put
both
plate
and
tart
away
.
<EOS>
Bessie
asked
if
I
would
have
a
book
:
<EOS>
the
word
_
book
_
acted
as
a
transient
stimulus
,
and
I
begged
her
to
fetch
Gulliver
's
Travels
from
the
library
.
<EOS>
This
book
I
had
again
and
again
perused
with
delight
.
<EOS>
I
considered
it
a
narrative
of
facts
,
and
discovered
in
it
a
vein
of
interest
deeper
than
what
I
found
in
fairy
tales
:
<EOS>
for
as
to
the
elves
,
having
sought
them
in
vain
among
foxglove
leaves
and
bells
,
under
mushrooms
and
beneath
the
ground
-
ivy
mantling
old
wall
-
nooks
,
I
had
at
length
made
up
my
mind
to
the
sad
truth
,
that
they
were
all
gone
out
of
England
to
some
savage
country
where
the
woods
were
wilder
and
thicker
,
and
the
population
more
scant
;
whereas
,
Lilliput
and
Brobdignag
being
,
in
my
creed
,
solid
parts
of
the
earth
's
surface
,
I
doubted
not
that
I
might
one
day
,
by
taking
a
long
voyage
,
see
with
my
own
eyes
the
little
fields
,
houses
,
and
trees
,
the
diminutive
people
,
the
tiny
cows
,
sheep
,
and
birds
of
the
one
realm
;
and
the
corn
-
fields
forest
-
high
,
the
mighty
mastiffs
,
the
monster
cats
,
the
tower
-
like
men
and
women
,
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
when
this
cherished
volume
was
now
placed
in
my
hand
 
when
I
turned
over
its
leaves
,
and
sought
in
its
marvellous
pictures
the
charm
I
had
,
till
now
,
never
failed
to
find
 
all
was
eerie
and
dreary
;
the
giants
were
gaunt
goblins
,
the
pigmies
malevolent
and
fearful
imps
,
Gulliver
a
most
desolate
wanderer
in
most
dread
and
dangerous
regions
.
<EOS>
I
closed
the
book
,
which
I
dared
no
longer
peruse
,
and
put
it
on
the
table
,
beside
the
untasted
tart
.
  
<EOS>
Bessie
had
now
finished
dusting
and
tidying
the
room
,
and
having
washed
her
hands
,
she
opened
a
certain
little
drawer
,
full
of
splendid
shreds
of
silk
and
satin
,
and
began
making
a
new
bonnet
for
Georgiana
's
doll
.
<EOS>
Meantime
she
sang
:
<EOS>
her
song
was
    
"
<EOS>
In
the
days
when
we
went
gipsying
,
A
long
time
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
often
heard
the
song
before
,
and
always
with
lively
delight
;
for
Bessie
had
a
sweet
voice
,
 
at
least
,
I
thought
so
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
though
her
voice
was
still
sweet
,
I
found
in
its
melody
an
indescribable
sadness
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
preoccupied
with
her
work
,
she
sang
the
refrain
very
low
,
very
lingeringly
;
"
A
long
time
ago
"
came
out
like
the
saddest
cadence
of
a
funeral
hymn
.
<EOS>
She
passed
into
another
ballad
,
this
time
a
really
doleful
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
feet
they
are
sore
,
and
my
limbs
they
are
weary
;
Long
is
the
way
,
and
the
mountains
are
wild
;
Soon
will
the
twilight
close
moonless
and
dreary
Over
the
path
of
the
poor
orphan
child
.
  
<EOS>
Why
did
they
send
me
so
far
and
so
lonely
,
Up
where
the
moors
spread
and
grey
rocks
are
piled
?
<EOS>
Men
are
hard
-
hearted
,
and
kind
angels
<EOS>
only
Watch
o'er
the
steps
of
a
poor
orphan
child
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
distant
and
soft
the
night
breeze
is
blowing
,
Clouds
there
are
none
,
and
clear
stars
beam
mild
,
<EOS>
God
,
in
His
mercy
,
protection
is
showing
,
Comfort
and
hope
to
the
poor
orphan
child
.
  
<EOS>
Ev'n
<EOS>
should
I
fall
o'er
the
broken
bridge
passing
,
Or
stray
in
the
marshes
,
by
false
lights
beguiled
<EOS>
,
Still
will
my
Father
,
with
promise
and
blessing
,
Take
to
His
bosom
the
poor
orphan
child
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
thought
that
for
strength
should
avail
me
,
Though
both
of
shelter
and
kindred
despoiled
;
Heaven
is
a
home
,
and
a
rest
will
not
fail
me
;
God
is
a
friend
to
the
poor
orphan
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
Miss
Jane
,
do
n't
cry
,
"
said
Bessie
as
she
finished
.
<EOS>
She
might
as
well
have
said
to
the
fire
,
"
do
n't
burn
!
"
<EOS>
but
how
could
she
divine
the
morbid
suffering
to
which
I
was
a
prey
?
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
morning
Mr.
Lloyd
came
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
already
up
!
"
said
he
,
as
he
entered
the
nursery
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
nurse
,
how
is
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
Bessie
answered
that
I
was
doing
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
she
ought
to
look
more
cheerful
.
<EOS>
Come
here
,
Miss
Jane
:
<EOS>
your
name
is
Jane
,
is
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
Jane
Eyre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
have
been
crying
,
Miss
Jane
Eyre
;
can
you
tell
me
what
about
?
<EOS>
Have
you
any
pain
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
daresay
she
is
crying
because
she
could
not
go
out
with
Missis
in
the
carriage
,
"
interposed
Bessie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
not
!
<EOS>
why
,
she
is
too
old
for
such
pettishness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
so
too
;
and
my
self
-
esteem
being
wounded
by
the
false
charge
,
I
answered
promptly
,
"
I
never
cried
for
such
a
thing
in
my
life
:
I
hate
going
out
in
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
I
cry
because
I
am
miserable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
fie
,
Miss
!
"
said
Bessie
.
  
<EOS>
The
good
apothecary
appeared
a
little
puzzled
.
<EOS>
I
was
standing
before
him
;
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
me
very
steadily
:
his
eyes
were
small
and
grey
;
not
very
bright
,
but
I
dare
say
I
should
think
them
shrewd
now
:
he
had
a
hard
-
featured
yet
good
-
natured
looking
face
.
<EOS>
Having
considered
me
at
leisure
,
he
said
    
"
What
made
you
ill
yesterday
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
She
had
a
fall
,
"
said
Bessie
,
again
putting
in
her
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fall
!
<EOS>
why
,
that
is
like
a
baby
again
!
<EOS>
Ca
n't
she
manage
to
walk
at
her
age
?
<EOS>
She
must
be
eight
or
nine
years
old
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
knocked
down
,
"
was
the
blunt
explanation
,
jerked
out
of
me
by
another
pang
of
mortified
pride
;
"
but
that
did
not
make
me
ill
,
"
I
added
;
while
Mr.
Lloyd
helped
himself
to
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
was
returning
the
box
to
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
a
loud
bell
rang
for
the
servants
'
dinner
;
he
knew
what
it
was
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
for
you
,
nurse
,
"
said
he
;
"
you
can
go
down
;
I
'll
give
Miss
Jane
a
lecture
till
you
come
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bessie
would
rather
have
stayed
,
but
she
was
obliged
to
go
,
because
punctuality
at
meals
was
rigidly
enforced
at
Gateshead
Hall
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
fall
did
not
make
you
ill
;
what
did
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
pursued
Mr.
Lloyd
when
Bessie
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
shut
up
in
a
room
where
there
is
a
ghost
till
after
dark
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
saw
Mr.
Lloyd
smile
and
frown
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ghost
!
<EOS>
What
,
you
are
a
baby
after
all
!
<EOS>
You
are
afraid
of
ghosts
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Of
Mr.
Reed
's
ghost
I
am
:
he
died
in
that
room
,
and
was
laid
out
there
.
<EOS>
Neither
Bessie
nor
any
one
else
will
go
into
it
at
night
,
if
they
can
help
it
;
and
it
was
cruel
to
shut
me
up
alone
without
a
candle
,
 
so
cruel
that
I
think
I
shall
never
forget
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
And
is
it
that
makes
you
so
miserable
?
<EOS>
Are
you
afraid
now
in
daylight
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
:
<EOS>
but
night
will
come
again
before
long
:
and
besides
,
 
I
am
unhappy
,
 
very
unhappy
,
for
other
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
other
things
?
<EOS>
Can
you
tell
me
some
of
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
How
much
I
wished
to
reply
fully
to
this
question
!
<EOS>
How
difficult
it
was
to
frame
any
answer
!
<EOS>
Children
can
feel
,
but
they
can
not
analyse
their
feelings
;
and
if
the
analysis
is
partially
effected
in
thought
,
they
know
not
how
to
express
the
result
of
the
process
in
words
.
<EOS>
Fearful
,
however
,
of
losing
this
first
and
only
opportunity
of
relieving
my
grief
by
imparting
it
,
I
,
after
a
disturbed
pause
,
contrived
to
frame
a
meagre
,
though
,
as
far
as
it
went
,
true
response
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
one
thing
,
I
have
no
father
or
mother
,
brothers
or
sisters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
kind
aunt
and
cousins
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
I
paused
;
then
bunglingly
enounced
    
"
<EOS>
But
John
Reed
knocked
me
down
,
and
my
aunt
shut
me
up
in
the
red
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lloyd
a
second
time
produced
his
snuff
-
box
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
Gateshead
Hall
a
very
beautiful
house
?
"
asked
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Are
you
not
very
thankful
to
have
such
a
fine
place
to
live
at
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
my
house
,
sir
;
and
Abbot
says
I
have
less
right
to
be
here
than
a
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
<EOS>
you
ca
n't
be
silly
enough
to
wish
to
leave
such
a
splendid
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
anywhere
else
to
go
,
I
should
be
glad
to
leave
it
;
but
I
can
never
get
away
from
Gateshead
till
I
am
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
may
 
who
knows
?
<EOS>
Have
you
any
relations
besides
Mrs.
Reed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
belonging
to
your
father
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
I
asked
Aunt
Reed
once
,
and
<EOS>
she
said
possibly
I
might
have
some
poor
,
low
relations
called
Eyre
,
but
she
knew
nothing
about
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
such
,
would
you
like
to
go
to
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
reflected
.
<EOS>
Poverty
looks
grim
to
grown
people
;
still
more
so
to
children
:
they
have
not
much
idea
of
industrious
,
working
,
respectable
poverty
;
they
think
of
the
word
only
as
connected
with
ragged
clothes
,
scanty
food
,
fireless
grates
,
rude
manners
,
and
debasing
vices
:
poverty
for
me
was
synonymous
with
degradation
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
should
not
like
to
belong
to
poor
people
,
"
was
my
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
even
if
they
were
kind
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
:
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
how
poor
people
had
the
means
of
being
kind
;
and
then
to
learn
to
speak
like
them
,
to
adopt
their
manners
,
to
be
uneducated
,
to
grow
up
like
one
of
the
poor
women
I
saw
sometimes
nursing
their
children
or
washing
their
clothes
at
the
cottage
doors
of
the
village
of
Gateshead
:
<EOS>
no
,
I
was
not
heroic
enough
to
purchase
liberty
at
the
price
of
caste
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
are
your
relatives
so
very
poor
?
<EOS>
Are
they
working
people
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
;
Aunt
Reed
says
if
I
have
any
,
they
must
be
a
beggarly
set
:
I
should
not
like
to
go
a
begging
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
you
like
to
go
to
school
?
"
  
<EOS>
Again
I
reflected
:
I
scarcely
knew
what
school
was
:
Bessie
sometimes
spoke
of
it
as
a
place
where
young
ladies
sat
in
the
stocks
,
wore
backboards
,
and
were
expected
to
be
exceedingly
genteel
and
precise
:
John
Reed
hated
his
school
,
and
abused
his
master
;
but
John
Reed
's
tastes
were
no
rule
for
mine
,
and
if
Bessie
's
accounts
of
school
-
discipline
(
gathered
from
the
young
ladies
of
a
family
where
she
had
lived
before
coming
to
Gateshead
)
were
somewhat
appalling
,
her
details
of
certain
accomplishments
attained
by
these
same
young
ladies
were
,
I
thought
,
equally
attractive
.
<EOS>
She
boasted
of
beautiful
paintings
of
landscapes
and
flowers
by
them
executed
;
of
songs
they
could
sing
and
pieces
they
could
play
,
of
purses
they
could
net
,
of
French
books
they
could
translate
;
till
my
spirit
was
moved
to
emulation
as
I
listened
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
school
would
be
a
complete
change
:
it
implied
a
long
journey
,
an
entire
separation
from
Gateshead
,
an
entrance
into
a
new
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
indeed
like
to
go
to
school
,
"
was
the
audible
conclusion
of
my
musings
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
<EOS>
who
knows
what
may
happen
?
"
said
Mr.
Lloyd
,
as
he
got
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
child
ought
to
have
change
of
air
and
scene
,
"
he
added
,
speaking
to
himself
;
"
nerves
not
in
a
good
state
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bessie
now
returned
;
at
the
same
moment
the
carriage
was
heard
rolling
up
the
gravel
-
walk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
your
mistress
,
nurse
?
"
asked
Mr.
Lloyd
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
speak
to
her
before
I
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bessie
invited
him
to
walk
into
the
breakfast
-
room
,
and
led
the
way
out
.
<EOS>
In
the
interview
which
followed
between
him
and
Mrs.
Reed
,
I
presume
,
from
after
-
occurrences
,
that
the
apothecary
ventured
to
recommend
my
being
sent
to
school
;
and
the
recommendation
was
no
doubt
readily
enough
adopted
;
for
as
Abbot
said
,
in
discussing
the
subject
with
Bessie
when
both
sat
sewing
in
the
nursery
one
night
,
after
I
was
in
bed
,
and
,
as
they
thought
,
asleep
,
"
Missis
was
,
she
dared
say
,
glad
enough
to
get
rid
of
such
a
tiresome
,
ill
-
conditioned
child
,
who
always
looked
as
if
she
were
watching
everybody
,
and
scheming
plots
underhand
.
<EOS>
"
Abbot
,
I
think
,
gave
me
credit
for
being
a
sort
of
infantine
Guy
Fawkes
.
  
<EOS>
On
that
same
occasion
I
learned
,
for
the
first
time
,
from
Miss
Abbot
's
communications
to
Bessie
,
that
my
father
had
been
a
poor
clergyman
;
that
my
mother
had
married
him
against
the
wishes
of
her
friends
,
who
considered
the
match
beneath
her
;
that
my
grandfather
Reed
was
so
irritated
at
her
disobedience
,
he
cut
her
off
without
a
shilling
;
that
after
my
mother
and
father
had
been
married
a
year
,
the
latter
caught
the
typhus
fever
while
visiting
among
the
poor
of
a
large
manufacturing
town
where
his
curacy
was
situated
,
and
where
that
disease
was
then
prevalent
:
that
my
mother
took
the
infection
from
him
,
and
both
died
within
a
month
of
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
Bessie
,
when
she
heard
this
narrative
,
sighed
and
said
,
"
Poor
Miss
Jane
is
to
be
pitied
,
too
,
Abbot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
responded
Abbot
;
"
if
she
were
a
nice
,
pretty
child
,
one
might
compassionate
her
forlornness
;
but
one
really
can
not
care
for
such
a
little
toad
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
great
deal
,
to
be
sure
,
"
agreed
Bessie
:
"
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
a
beauty
like
Miss
Georgiana
would
be
more
moving
in
the
same
condition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
doat
on
Miss
Georgiana
!
"
cried
the
fervent
Abbot
.
"
<EOS>
Little
darling
!
 
<EOS>
with
her
long
curls
and
her
blue
eyes
,
and
such
a
sweet
colour
as
she
has
;
just
as
if
she
were
painted
!
 
<EOS>
Bessie
,
I
could
fancy
a
Welsh
rabbit
for
supper
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
So
could
I
 
with
a
roast
onion
.
<EOS>
Come
,
we
'll
go
down
.
<EOS>
"
They
went
.
    
<EOS>
From
my
discourse
with
Mr.
Lloyd
,
and
from
the
above
reported
conference
between
Bessie
and
Abbot
,
I
gathered
enough
of
hope
to
suffice
as
a
motive
for
wishing
to
get
well
:
<EOS>
a
change
seemed
near
,
 
I
desired
and
waited
it
in
silence
.
<EOS>
It
tarried
,
however
:
<EOS>
days
and
weeks
passed
:
I
had
regained
my
normal
state
of
health
,
but
no
new
allusion
was
made
to
the
subject
over
which
I
brooded
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
surveyed
me
at
times
with
a
severe
eye
,
but
seldom
addressed
me
:
since
my
illness
,
she
had
drawn
a
more
marked
line
of
separation
than
ever
between
me
and
her
own
children
;
appointing
me
a
small
closet
to
sleep
in
by
myself
,
condemning
me
to
take
my
meals
alone
,
and
pass
all
my
time
in
the
nursery
,
while
my
cousins
were
constantly
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Not
a
hint
,
however
,
did
she
drop
about
sending
me
to
school
:
still
I
felt
an
instinctive
certainty
that
she
would
not
long
endure
me
under
the
same
roof
with
her
;
for
her
glance
,
now
more
than
ever
,
when
turned
on
me
,
expressed
an
insuperable
and
rooted
aversion
.
  
<EOS>
Eliza
and
Georgiana
,
evidently
acting
according
to
orders
,
spoke
to
me
as
little
as
possible
:
John
thrust
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
whenever
he
saw
me
,
and
once
attempted
chastisement
;
but
as
I
instantly
turned
against
him
,
roused
by
the
same
sentiment
of
deep
ire
and
desperate
revolt
which
had
stirred
my
corruption
before
,
he
thought
it
better
to
desist
,
and
ran
from
me
tittering
execrations
,
and
vowing
I
had
burst
his
nose
.
<EOS>
I
had
indeed
levelled
at
that
prominent
feature
as
hard
a
blow
as
my
knuckles
could
inflict
;
and
when
I
saw
that
either
that
or
my
look
daunted
him
,
I
had
the
greatest
inclination
to
follow
up
my
advantage
to
purpose
;
but
he
was
already
with
his
mama
.
<EOS>
I
heard
him
in
a
blubbering
tone
commence
the
tale
of
how
"
that
nasty
Jane
Eyre
"
had
flown
at
him
like
a
mad
cat
:
he
was
stopped
rather
harshly
    
"
Do
n't
talk
to
me
about
her
,
John
<EOS>
:
I
told
you
not
to
go
near
her
;
she
is
not
worthy
of
notice
;
I
do
not
choose
that
either
you
or
your
sisters
should
associate
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
,
leaning
over
the
banister
,
I
cried
out
suddenly
,
and
without
at
all
deliberating
on
my
words
    
<EOS>
"
They
are
not
fit
to
associate
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
was
rather
a
stout
woman
;
but
,
on
hearing
this
strange
and
audacious
declaration
,
she
ran
nimbly
up
the
stair
,
swept
me
like
a
whirlwind
into
the
nursery
,
and
crushing
me
down
on
the
edge
of
my
crib
,
dared
me
in
an
emphatic
voice
to
rise
from
that
place
,
or
utter
one
syllable
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
would
Uncle
Reed
say
to
you
,
if
he
were
alive
?
"
was
my
scarcely
voluntary
demand
.
<EOS>
I
say
scarcely
voluntary
,
for
it
seemed
as
if
my
tongue
pronounced
words
without
my
will
consenting
to
their
utterance
<EOS>
:
something
spoke
out
of
me
over
which
I
had
no
control
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
said
Mrs.
Reed
under
her
breath
:
<EOS>
her
usually
cold
composed
grey
eye
became
troubled
with
a
look
like
fear
;
she
took
her
hand
from
my
arm
,
and
gazed
at
me
as
if
she
really
did
not
know
whether
I
were
child
or
fiend
.
<EOS>
I
was
now
in
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
Uncle
Reed
is
in
heaven
,
and
can
see
all
you
do
and
think
;
and
so
can
papa
and
mama
:
<EOS>
they
know
how
you
shut
me
up
all
day
long
,
and
how
you
wish
me
dead
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
soon
rallied
her
spirits
:
she
shook
me
most
soundly
,
she
boxed
both
my
ears
,
and
then
left
me
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
Bessie
supplied
the
hiatus
by
a
homily
of
an
hour
's
length
,
in
which
she
proved
beyond
a
doubt
that
I
was
the
most
wicked
and
abandoned
child
ever
reared
under
a
roof
.
<EOS>
I
half
believed
her
;
for
I
felt
indeed
only
bad
feelings
surging
in
my
breast
.
  
<EOS>
November
,
December
,
and
half
of
January
passed
away
.
<EOS>
Christmas
and
the
New
Year
had
been
celebrated
at
Gateshead
with
the
usual
festive
cheer
;
presents
had
been
interchanged
,
dinners
and
evening
parties
given
.
<EOS>
From
every
enjoyment
I
was
,
of
course
,
excluded
:
<EOS>
my
share
of
the
gaiety
consisted
in
witnessing
the
daily
apparelling
of
Eliza
and
Georgiana
,
and
seeing
them
descend
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
dressed
out
in
thin
muslin
frocks
and
scarlet
sashes
,
with
hair
elaborately
ringletted
;
and
afterwards
,
in
listening
to
the
sound
of
the
piano
or
the
harp
played
below
,
to
the
passing
to
and
fro
of
the
butler
and
footman
,
to
the
jingling
of
glass
and
china
as
refreshments
were
handed
,
to
the
broken
hum
of
conversation
as
the
drawing
-
room
door
opened
and
closed
.
<EOS>
When
tired
of
this
occupation
,
I
would
retire
from
the
stairhead
to
the
solitary
and
silent
nursery
:
there
,
though
somewhat
sad
,
I
was
not
miserable
.
<EOS>
To
speak
truth
,
I
had
not
the
least
wish
to
go
into
company
,
for
in
company
I
was
very
rarely
noticed
;
and
if
Bessie
had
but
been
kind
and
companionable
,
I
should
have
deemed
it
a
treat
to
spend
the
evenings
quietly
with
her
,
instead
of
passing
them
under
the
formidable
eye
of
Mrs.
Reed
,
in
a
room
full
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
But
Bessie
,
as
soon
as
she
had
dressed
her
young
ladies
,
used
to
take
herself
off
to
the
lively
regions
of
the
kitchen
and
housekeeper
's
room
,
generally
bearing
the
candle
along
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
then
sat
with
my
doll
on
my
knee
till
the
fire
got
low
,
glancing
round
occasionally
to
make
sure
that
nothing
worse
than
myself
haunted
the
shadowy
room
;
and
when
the
embers
sank
to
a
dull
red
,
I
undressed
hastily
,
tugging
at
knots
and
strings
as
I
best
might
,
and
sought
shelter
from
cold
and
darkness
in
my
crib
.
<EOS>
To
this
crib
I
always
took
my
doll
;
human
beings
must
love
something
,
and
,
in
the
dearth
of
worthier
objects
of
affection
,
I
contrived
to
find
a
pleasure
in
loving
and
cherishing
a
faded
graven
image
,
shabby
as
a
miniature
scarecrow
.
<EOS>
It
puzzles
me
now
to
remember
with
what
absurd
sincerity
I
doated
on
this
little
toy
,
half
fancying
it
alive
and
capable
of
sensation
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
sleep
unless
it
was
folded
in
my
night
-
gown
;
and
when
it
lay
there
safe
and
warm
,
I
was
comparatively
happy
,
believing
it
to
be
happy
likewise
.
  
<EOS>
Long
did
the
hours
seem
while
I
waited
the
departure
of
the
company
,
and
listened
for
the
sound
of
Bessie
's
step
on
the
stairs
:
sometimes
she
would
come
up
in
the
interval
to
seek
her
thimble
or
her
scissors
,
or
perhaps
to
bring
me
something
by
way
of
supper
 
<EOS>
a
bun
or
a
cheese
-
cake
 
<EOS>
then
she
would
sit
on
the
bed
while
I
ate
it
,
and
when
I
had
finished
,
she
would
tuck
the
clothes
round
me
,
and
twice
she
kissed
me
,
and
said
,
"
Good
night
,
Miss
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
When
thus
gentle
,
Bessie
seemed
to
me
the
best
,
prettiest
,
kindest
being
in
the
world
;
and
I
wished
most
intensely
that
she
would
always
be
so
pleasant
and
amiable
,
and
never
push
me
about
,
or
scold
,
or
task
me
unreasonably
,
as
she
was
too
often
wo
nt
to
do
.
<EOS>
Bessie
Lee
must
,
I
think
,
have
been
a
girl
of
good
natural
capacity
,
for
she
was
smart
in
all
she
did
,
and
had
a
remarkable
knack
of
narrative
;
so
,
at
least
,
I
judge
from
the
impression
made
on
me
by
her
nursery
tales
.
<EOS>
She
was
pretty
too
,
if
my
recollections
of
her
face
and
person
are
correct
.
<EOS>
I
remember
her
as
a
slim
young
woman
,
with
black
hair
,
dark
eyes
,
very
nice
features
,
and
good
,
clear
complexion
;
but
she
had
a
capricious
and
hasty
temper
,
and
indifferent
ideas
of
principle
or
justice
:
still
,
such
as
she
was
,
I
preferred
her
to
any
one
else
at
Gateshead
Hall
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
fifteenth
of
January
,
about
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
:
<EOS>
Bessie
was
gone
down
to
breakfast
;
my
cousins
had
not
yet
been
summoned
to
their
mama
;
Eliza
was
putting
on
her
bonnet
and
warm
garden
-
coat
to
go
and
feed
her
poultry
,
an
occupation
of
which
she
was
fond
:
and
not
less
so
of
selling
the
eggs
to
the
housekeeper
and
hoarding
up
the
money
she
thus
obtained
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
turn
for
traffic
,
and
a
marked
propensity
for
saving
;
shown
not
only
in
the
vending
of
eggs
and
chickens
,
but
also
in
driving
hard
bargains
with
the
gardener
about
flower
-
roots
,
seeds
,
and
slips
of
plants
;
<EOS>
that
functionary
having
orders
from
Mrs.
Reed
to
buy
of
his
young
lady
all
the
products
of
her
parterre
she
wished
to
sell
:
and
Eliza
would
have
sold
the
hair
off
her
head
if
she
could
have
made
a
handsome
profit
thereby
.
<EOS>
As
to
her
money
,
she
first
secreted
it
in
odd
corners
,
wrapped
in
a
rag
or
an
old
curl
-
paper
;
but
some
of
these
hoards
having
been
discovered
by
the
housemaid
,
Eliza
,
fearful
of
one
day
losing
her
valued
treasure
,
consented
to
intrust
it
to
her
mother
,
at
a
usurious
rate
of
interest
 
fifty
or
sixty
per
cent
.
;
which
interest
she
exacted
every
quarter
,
keeping
her
accounts
in
a
little
book
with
anxious
accuracy
.
  
<EOS>
Georgiana
sat
on
a
high
stool
,
dressing
her
hair
at
the
glass
,
and
interweaving
her
curls
with
artificial
flowers
and
faded
feathers
,
of
which
she
had
found
a
store
in
a
drawer
in
the
attic
.
<EOS>
I
was
making
my
bed
,
having
received
strict
orders
from
Bessie
to
get
it
arranged
before
she
returned
(
for
Bessie
now
frequently
employed
me
as
a
sort
of
under-
nurserymaid
,
to
tidy
the
room
,
dust
the
chairs
,
&
c.
)
.
<EOS>
Having
spread
the
quilt
and
folded
my
night
-
dress
,
I
went
to
the
window
-
seat
to
put
in
order
<EOS>
some
picture
-
books
and
doll
's
house
furniture
scattered
there
;
an
abrupt
command
from
Georgiana
to
let
her
playthings
alone
(
for
the
tiny
chairs
and
mirrors
,
the
fairy
plates
and
cups
,
were
her
property
)
stopped
my
proceedings
;
and
then
,
for
lack
of
other
occupation
,
I
fell
to
breathing
on
the
frost
-
flowers
with
which
the
window
was
fretted
,
and
thus
clearing
a
space
in
the
glass
through
which
I
might
look
out
on
the
grounds
,
where
all
was
still
and
petrified
under
the
influence
of
a
hard
frost
.
  
<EOS>
From
this
window
were
visible
the
porter
's
lodge
and
the
carriage
-
road
,
and
just
as
I
had
dissolved
so
much
of
the
silver
-
white
foliage
veiling
the
panes
as
left
room
to
look
out
,
I
saw
the
gates
thrown
open
and
a
carriage
roll
through
.
<EOS>
I
watched
it
ascending
the
drive
with
indifference
;
carriages
often
came
to
Gateshead
,
but
none
ever
brought
visitors
in
whom
I
was
interested
;
it
stopped
in
front
of
the
house
,
the
door
-
bell
rang
loudly
,
the
new
-
comer
was
admitted
.
<EOS>
All
this
being
nothing
to
me
,
my
vacant
attention
soon
found
livelier
attraction
in
the
spectacle
of
a
little
hungry
robin
,
which
came
and
chirruped
on
the
twigs
of
the
leafless
cherry
-
tree
nailed
against
the
wall
near
the
casement
.
<EOS>
The
remains
of
my
breakfast
of
bread
and
milk
stood
on
the
table
,
and
having
crumbled
a
morsel
of
roll
,
I
was
tugging
at
the
sash
to
put
out
the
crumbs
on
the
window
-
sill
,
when
Bessie
came
running
upstairs
into
the
nursery
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Jane
,
take
off
your
pinafore
;
what
are
you
doing
there
?
<EOS>
Have
you
washed
your
hands
and
face
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
I
gave
another
tug
before
I
answered
,
for
I
wanted
the
bird
to
be
secure
of
its
bread
:
the
sash
yielded
;
I
scattered
the
crumbs
,
some
on
the
stone
sill
,
some
on
the
cherry
-
tree
bough
,
then
,
closing
the
window
,
I
replied
    
"
<EOS>
No
,
Bessie
;
I
have
only
just
finished
dusting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Troublesome
,
careless
child
!
<EOS>
and
what
are
you
doing
now
?
<EOS>
You
look
quite
red
,
as
if
you
had
been
about
some
mischief
:
what
were
you
opening
the
window
for
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
spared
the
trouble
of
answering
,
for
<EOS>
Bessie
seemed
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
listen
to
explanations
;
she
hauled
me
to
the
washstand
,
inflicted
a
merciless
,
but
happily
brief
scrub
on
my
face
and
hands
with
soap
,
water
,
and
a
coarse
towel
;
disciplined
my
head
with
a
bristly
brush
,
denuded
me
of
my
pinafore
,
and
then
hurrying
me
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
,
bid
me
go
down
directly
,
as
I
was
wanted
in
the
breakfast
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
asked
who
wanted
me
:
I
would
have
demanded
if
Mrs.
Reed
was
there
;
but
Bessie
was
already
gone
,
and
had
closed
the
nursery
-
door
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
slowly
descended
.
<EOS>
For
nearly
three
months
,
I
had
never
been
called
to
Mrs.
Reed
's
presence
;
restricted
so
long
to
the
nursery
,
the
breakfast
,
dining
,
and
drawing
-
rooms
were
become
for
me
awful
regions
,
on
which
it
dismayed
me
to
intrude
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
stood
in
the
empty
hall
;
before
me
was
the
breakfast
-
room
door
,
and
I
stopped
,
intimidated
and
trembling
.
<EOS>
What
a
miserable
little
poltroon
had
fear
,
engendered
of
unjust
punishment
,
made
of
me
in
those
days
!
<EOS>
I
feared
to
return
to
the
nursery
,
and
feared
to
go
forward
to
the
parlour
;
ten
minutes
I
stood
in
agitated
hesitation
;
the
vehement
ringing
of
the
breakfast
-
room
bell
decided
me
;
I
_
must
_
enter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
could
want
me
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
inwardly
,
as
with
both
hands
I
turned
the
stiff
door
-
handle
,
which
,
for
a
second
or
two
,
resisted
my
efforts
.
<EOS>
"
What
should
I
see
besides
Aunt
Reed
in
the
apartment
?
 
<EOS>
a
man
or
a
woman
?
<EOS>
"
The
handle
turned
,
the
door
unclosed
,
and
passing
through
and
curtseying
low
,
I
looked
up
at
 
a
black
pillar
!
 
<EOS>
such
,
at
least
,
appeared
to
me
,
at
first
sight
,
the
straight
,
narrow
,
sable
-
clad
shape
standing
erect
on
the
rug
<EOS>
:
the
grim
face
at
the
top
was
like
a
carved
mask
,
placed
above
the
shaft
by
way
of
capital
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
occupied
her
usual
seat
by
the
fireside
;
she
made
a
signal
to
me
to
approach
;
I
did
so
,
and
she
introduced
me
to
the
stony
stranger
with
the
words
:
"
<EOS>
This
is
the
little
girl
respecting
whom
I
applied
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
,
for
it
was
a
man
,
turned
his
head
slowly
towards
where
I
stood
,
and
having
examined
me
with
the
two
inquisitive
-
looking
grey
eyes
which
twinkled
under
a
pair
of
bushy
brows
,
said
solemnly
,
and
in
a
bass
voice
,
"
Her
size
is
small
:
what
is
her
age
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ten
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
So
much
?
"
was
the
doubtful
answer
;
and
he
prolonged
his
scrutiny
for
some
minutes
.
<EOS>
Presently
he
addressed
me
 
"
Your
name
,
little
girl
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
Eyre
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
uttering
these
words
I
looked
up
:
he
seemed
to
me
a
tall
gentleman
;
but
then
I
was
very
little
;
his
features
were
large
,
and
they
and
all
the
lines
of
his
frame
were
equally
harsh
and
prim
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Jane
Eyre
,
and
are
you
a
good
child
?
"
  
<EOS>
Impossible
to
reply
to
this
in
the
affirmative
:
my
little
world
held
a
contrary
opinion
<EOS>
:
I
was
silent
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
answered
for
me
by
an
expressive
shake
of
the
head
,
adding
soon
,
"
Perhaps
the
less
said
on
that
subject
the
better
,
Mr.
Brocklehurst
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sorry
indeed
to
hear
it
!
<EOS>
she
and
I
must
have
some
talk
;
"
and
bending
from
the
perpendicular
,
he
installed
his
person
in
the
arm
-
chair
opposite
Mrs.
Reed
's
.
<EOS>
"
Come
here
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
I
stepped
across
the
rug
;
he
placed
me
square
and
straight
before
him
.
<EOS>
What
a
face
he
had
,
now
that
it
was
almost
on
a
level
with
mine
!
<EOS>
what
a
great
nose
!
<EOS>
and
what
a
mouth
!
<EOS>
and
what
large
prominent
teeth
!
  
<EOS>
"
No
sight
so
sad
as
that
of
a
naughty
child
,
"
he
began
,
"
especially
a
naughty
little
girl
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
where
the
wicked
go
after
death
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
go
to
hell
,
"
was
my
ready
and
orthodox
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
hell
?
<EOS>
Can
you
tell
me
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
pit
full
of
fire
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
should
you
like
to
fall
into
that
pit
,
and
to
be
burning
there
for
ever
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
must
you
do
to
avoid
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
deliberated
a
moment
;
my
answer
,
when
it
did
come
,
was
objectionable
:
"
I
must
keep
in
good
health
,
and
not
die
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
keep
in
good
health
?
<EOS>
Children
younger
than
you
die
daily
.
<EOS>
I
buried
a
little
child
of
five
years
old
only
a
day
or
two
since
,
 
a
good
little
child
,
whose
soul
is
now
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
It
is
to
be
feared
the
same
could
not
be
said
of
you
were
you
to
be
called
hence
.
"
  
<EOS>
Not
being
in
a
condition
to
remove
his
doubt
,
I
only
cast
my
eyes
down
on
the
two
large
feet
planted
on
the
rug
,
and
sighed
,
wishing
myself
far
enough
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
that
sigh
is
from
the
heart
,
and
that
you
repent
of
ever
having
been
the
occasion
of
discomfort
to
your
excellent
benefactress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Benefactress
!
benefactress
!
<EOS>
"
said
I
inwardly
:
"
they
all
call
Mrs.
Reed
my
benefactress
;
if
so
,
a
benefactress
is
a
disagreeable
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
say
your
prayers
night
and
morning
?
<EOS>
"
continued
my
interrogator
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
read
your
Bible
?
"
  
"
Sometimes
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
With
pleasure
?
<EOS>
Are
you
fond
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
Revelations
,
and
the
book
of
Daniel
,
and
Genesis
and
Samuel
,
and
a
little
bit
of
Exodus
,
and
some
parts
of
Kings
and
Chronicles
,
and
Job
and
Jonah
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
the
Psalms
?
<EOS>
I
hope
you
like
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
?
<EOS>
oh
,
shocking
!
<EOS>
I
have
a
little
boy
,
younger
than
you
,
who
knows
six
Psalms
by
heart
:
and
when
you
ask
him
which
he
would
rather
have
,
a
gingerbread
-
nut
to
eat
or
a
verse
of
a
Psalm
to
learn
,
he
says
:
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
the
verse
of
a
Psalm
!
<EOS>
angels
sing
Psalms
;
"
says
he
,
"
I
wish
to
be
a
little
angel
here
below
;
"
he
then
gets
two
nuts
in
recompense
for
his
infant
piety
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Psalms
are
not
interesting
,
"
I
remarked
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
proves
you
have
a
wicked
heart
;
and
you
must
pray
to
God
to
change
it
:
to
give
you
a
new
and
clean
one
:
to
take
away
your
heart
of
stone
and
give
you
a
heart
of
flesh
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
about
to
propound
a
question
,
touching
the
manner
in
which
that
operation
of
changing
my
heart
was
to
be
performed
,
when
Mrs.
Reed
interposed
,
telling
me
to
sit
down
;
she
then
proceeded
to
carry
on
the
conversation
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
I
believe
I
intimated
in
the
letter
which
I
wrote
to
you
three
weeks
ago
,
that
this
little
girl
has
not
quite
the
character
and
disposition
I
could
wish
:
should
you
admit
her
into
Lowood
school
,
I
should
be
glad
if
the
superintendent
and
teachers
were
requested
to
keep
a
strict
eye
on
her
,
and
,
above
all
,
to
guard
against
her
worst
fault
,
a
tendency
to
deceit
.
<EOS>
I
mention
this
in
your
hearing
,
Jane
,
that
you
may
not
attempt
to
impose
on
Mr.
Brocklehurst
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Well
might
I
dread
,
well
might
I
dislike
Mrs.
Reed
;
for
it
was
her
nature
to
wound
me
cruelly
;
never
was
I
happy
in
her
presence
<EOS>
;
however
carefully
I
obeyed
,
however
strenuously
I
strove
to
please
her
,
my
efforts
were
still
repulsed
and
repaid
by
such
sentences
as
the
above
.
<EOS>
Now
,
uttered
before
a
stranger
,
the
accusation
cut
me
to
the
heart
;
I
dimly
perceived
that
she
was
already
obliterating
hope
from
the
new
phase
of
existence
which
she
destined
me
to
enter
;
I
felt
,
though
I
could
not
have
expressed
the
feeling
,
that
she
was
sowing
aversion
and
unkindness
along
my
future
path
;
I
saw
myself
transformed
under
Mr.
Brocklehurst
's
eye
into
an
artful
,
noxious
child
,
and
what
could
I
do
to
remedy
the
injury
?
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
indeed
,
"
thought
I
,
as
I
struggled
to
repress
a
sob
,
and
hastily
wiped
away
some
tears
,
the
impotent
evidences
of
my
anguish
.
  
<EOS>
"
Deceit
is
,
indeed
,
a
sad
fault
in
a
child
,
"
said
Mr.
Brocklehurst
;
"
it
is
akin
to
falsehood
,
and
all
liars
will
have
their
portion
in
the
lake
burning
with
fire
and
brimstone
;
she
shall
,
however
,
be
watched
,
Mrs.
Reed
.
<EOS>
I
will
speak
to
Miss
Temple
and
the
teachers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
wish
her
to
be
brought
up
in
a
manner
suiting
her
prospects
,
"
continued
my
benefactress
;
"
to
be
made
useful
,
to
be
kept
humble
:
as
for
the
vacations
,
she
will
,
with
your
permission
,
spend
them
always
at
Lowood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
decisions
are
perfectly
judicious
,
madam
,
"
returned
Mr.
Brocklehurst
.
<EOS>
"
Humility
is
a
Christian
grace
,
and
one
peculiarly
appropriate
to
the
pupils
of
Lowood
;
I
,
therefore
,
direct
that
especial
care
shall
be
bestowed
on
its
cultivation
amongst
them
.
<EOS>
I
have
studied
how
best
to
mortify
in
them
the
worldly
sentiment
of
pride
;
and
,
only
the
other
day
,
I
had
a
pleasing
proof
of
my
success
.
<EOS>
My
second
daughter
,
Augusta
,
went
with
her
mama
to
visit
the
school
,
and
on
her
return
she
exclaimed
:
"
Oh
,
dear
papa
,
how
quiet
and
plain
all
the
girls
at
Lowood
look
,
with
their
hair
combed
behind
their
ears
,
and
their
long
pinafores
,
and
those
little
holland
pockets
outside
their
frocks
 
<EOS>
they
are
almost
like
poor
people
's
children
!
<EOS>
and
,
"
said
she
,
"
they
looked
at
my
dress
and
mama
's
,
as
if
they
had
never
seen
a
silk
gown
before
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
This
is
the
state
of
things
I
quite
approve
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Reed
;
"
had
I
sought
all
England
over
,
I
could
scarcely
have
found
a
system
more
exactly
fitting
a
child
like
Jane
Eyre
.
<EOS>
Consistency
,
my
dear
Mr.
Brocklehurst
<EOS>
;
I
advocate
consistency
in
all
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Consistency
,
madam
,
is
the
first
of
Christian
duties
;
and
it
has
been
observed
in
every
arrangement
connected
with
the
establishment
of
Lowood
:
plain
fare
,
simple
attire
,
unsophisticated
accommodations
,
hardy
and
active
habits
;
such
is
the
order
of
the
day
in
the
house
and
its
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
may
then
depend
upon
this
child
being
received
as
a
pupil
at
Lowood
,
and
there
being
trained
in
conformity
to
her
position
and
prospects
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
you
may
:
she
shall
be
placed
in
that
nursery
of
chosen
plants
,
and
I
trust
she
will
show
herself
grateful
for
the
inestimable
privilege
of
her
election
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
send
her
,
then
,
as
soon
as
possible
,
Mr.
Brocklehurst
;
for
,
I
assure
you
,
I
feel
anxious
to
be
relieved
of
a
responsibility
that
was
becoming
too
irksome
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
no
doubt
,
madam
;
and
now
I
wish
you
good
morning
.
<EOS>
I
shall
return
to
Brocklehurst
Hall
in
the
course
of
a
week
or
two
:
<EOS>
my
good
friend
,
the
Archdeacon
,
will
not
permit
me
to
leave
him
sooner
.
<EOS>
I
shall
send
Miss
Temple
notice
that
she
is
to
expect
a
new
girl
,
so
that
there
will
be
no
difficulty
about
receiving
her

Good

Good
-
bye

Mr.
Brocklehurst

remember
me
to
Mrs.

Brocklehurst

to
Augusta

Theodore

and
Master
Broughton
Brocklehurst

<EOS>
Little
girl
,
here
is
a
book
entitled
the
"
Child
's
Guide
,
"
read
it
with
prayer
,
especially
that
part
containing
"
An
account
of
the
awfully
sudden
death
of
Martha
G
 
,
a
naughty
child
addicted
to
falsehood
and
deceit
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
With
these
words
Mr.
Brocklehurst
put
into
my
hand
a
thin
pamphlet
sewn
in
a
cover
,
and
having
rung
for
his
carriage
,
he
departed
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
and
I
were
left
alone
:
<EOS>
some
minutes
passed
in
silence
;
she
was
sewing
,
I
was
watching
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
might
be
at
that
time
some
six
or
seven
and
thirty
;
she
was
a
woman
of
robust
frame
,
square
-
shouldered
and
strong
-
limbed
,
not
tall
,
and
,
though
stout
,
not
obese
:
she
had
a
somewhat
large
face
,
the
under
jaw
being
much
developed
and
very
solid
;
her
brow
was
low
,
her
chin
large
and
prominent
,
mouth
and
nose
sufficiently
regular
;
under
her
light
eyebrows
glimmered
an
eye
devoid
of
ruth
;
her
skin
was
dark
and
opaque
,
<EOS>
her
hair
nearly
flaxen
;
her
constitution
was
sound
as
a
bell
 
<EOS>
illness
never
came
near
her
;
she
was
an
exact
,
clever
manager
;
her
household
and
tenantry
were
thoroughly
under
her
control
;
her
children
only
at
times
defied
her
authority
and
laughed
it
to
scorn
;
she
dressed
well
,
and
had
a
presence
and
port
calculated
to
set
off
handsome
attire
.
  
<EOS>
Sitting
on
a
low
stool
,
a
few
yards
from
her
arm
-
chair
,
I
examined
her
figure
;
I
perused
her
features
.
<EOS>
In
my
hand
I
held
the
tract
containing
the
sudden
death
of
the
Liar
,
to
which
narrative
my
attention
had
been
pointed
as
to
an
appropriate
warning
.
<EOS>
What
had
just
passed
;
what
Mrs.
Reed
had
said
concerning
me
to
Mr.
Brocklehurst
;
the
whole
tenor
of
their
conversation
,
was
recent
,
raw
,
and
stinging
in
my
mind
;
I
had
felt
every
word
as
acutely
as
I
had
heard
it
plainly
,
and
a
passion
of
resentment
fomented
now
within
me
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
looked
up
from
her
work
;
her
eye
settled
on
mine
,
her
fingers
at
the
same
time
suspended
their
nimble
movements
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
out
of
the
room
;
return
to
the
nursery
,
"
was
her
mandate
.
<EOS>
My
look
or
something
else
must
have
struck
her
as
offensive
,
for
she
spoke
with
extreme
though
suppressed
irritation
.
<EOS>
I
got
up
<EOS>
,
I
went
to
the
door
;
I
came
back
again
;
I
walked
to
the
window
,
across
the
room
,
then
close
up
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Speak
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
must
:
<EOS>
I
had
been
trodden
on
severely
,
and
_
must
_
turn
:
<EOS>
but
how
?
<EOS>
What
strength
had
I
to
dart
retaliation
at
my
antagonist
?
<EOS>
I
gathered
my
energies
and
launched
them
in
this
blunt
sentence
    
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
deceitful
:
if
I
were
,
I
should
say
I
loved
you
;
but
I
declare
I
do
not
love
you
<EOS>
:
I
dislike
you
the
worst
of
anybody
in
the
world
except
John
Reed
;
and
this
book
about
the
liar
,
you
may
give
to
your
girl
,
Georgiana
,
<EOS>
for
it
is
she
who
tells
lies
,
and
not
I.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
's
hands
still
lay
on
her
work
inactive
:
her
eye
of
ice
continued
to
dwell
freezingly
on
mine
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
more
have
you
to
say
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
rather
in
the
tone
in
which
a
person
might
address
an
opponent
of
adult
age
than
such
as
is
ordinarily
used
to
a
child
.
  
<EOS>
That
eye
of
hers
,
that
voice
stirred
every
antipathy
I
had
.
<EOS>
Shaking
from
head
to
foot
,
thrilled
with
ungovernable
excitement
,
I
continued
    
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
are
no
relation
of
mine
:
I
will
never
call
you
aunt
again
as
long
as
I
live
.
<EOS>
I
will
never
come
to
see
you
when
I
am
grown
up
;
and
if
any
one
asks
me
how
I
liked
you
,
and
how
you
treated
me
<EOS>
,
I
will
say
the
very
thought
of
you
makes
me
sick
,
and
that
you
treated
me
with
miserable
cruelty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
affirm
that
,
Jane
Eyre
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
dare
I
,
Mrs.
Reed
?
<EOS>
How
dare
I
?
<EOS>
Because
it
is
the
_
truth
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
You
think
I
have
no
feelings
,
and
that
I
can
do
without
one
bit
of
love
or
kindness
;
but
I
can
not
live
so
:
and
you
have
no
pity
.
<EOS>
I
shall
remember
how
you
thrust
me
back
 
roughly
and
violently
thrust
me
back
 
into
the
red
-
room
,
and
locked
me
up
there
,
to
my
dying
day
;
though
I
was
in
agony
;
though
I
cried
out
,
while
suffocating
with
distress
,
"
Have
mercy
!
<EOS>
Have
mercy
,
Aunt
Reed
!
"
<EOS>
And
that
punishment
you
made
me
suffer
because
your
wicked
boy
struck
me
 
knocked
me
down
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
anybody
who
asks
me
questions
,
this
exact
tale
.
<EOS>
People
think
you
a
good
woman
,
but
you
are
bad
,
hard
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
are
deceitful
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
{
How
dare
I
,
Mrs.
Ried
?
<EOS>
How
dare
I
?
<EOS>
Because
it
is
the
truth
:
<EOS>

<EOS>
}
  
Ere
I
had
finished
this
reply
,
my
soul
began
to
expand
,
to
exult
,
with
the
strangest
sense
of
freedom
,
of
triumph
,
I
ever
felt
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
an
invisible
bond
had
burst
,
and
that
I
had
struggled
out
into
unhoped-
for
liberty
.
<EOS>
Not
without
cause
was
this
sentiment
:
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
looked
frightened
;
her
work
had
slipped
from
her
knee
;
she
was
lifting
up
her
hands
,
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
,
and
even
twisting
her
face
as
if
she
would
cry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
you
are
under
a
mistake
:
<EOS>
what
is
the
matter
with
you
?
<EOS>
Why
do
you
tremble
so
violently
?
<EOS>
Would
you
like
to
drink
some
water
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mrs.
Reed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anything
else
you
wish
for
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
I
desire
to
be
your
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
you
.
<EOS>
You
told
Mr.
Brocklehurst
I
had
a
bad
character
,
a
deceitful
disposition
;
and
I
'll
let
everybody
at
Lowood
know
what
you
are
,
and
what
you
have
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
you
do
n't
understand
these
things
:
children
must
be
corrected
for
their
faults
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Deceit
is
not
my
fault
!
"
<EOS>
I
cried
out
in
a
savage
,
high
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
passionate
,
Jane
,
that
you
must
allow
:
and
now
return
to
the
nursery
 
<EOS>
there
's
a
dear
 
and
lie
down
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
your
dear
;
I
can
not
lie
down
:
send
me
to
school
soon
,
Mrs.
Reed
,
for
I
hate
to
live
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
indeed
send
her
to
school
soon
,
"
murmured
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
_
sotto
voce
_
;
and
gathering
up
her
work
,
she
abruptly
quitted
the
apartment
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
left
there
alone
 
winner
of
the
field
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
hardest
battle
I
had
fought
,
and
the
first
victory
I
had
gained
<EOS>
:
I
stood
awhile
on
the
rug
,
where
Mr.
Brocklehurst
had
stood
,
and
I
enjoyed
my
conqueror
's
solitude
.
<EOS>
First
,
I
smiled
to
myself
and
felt
elate
;
but
this
fierce
pleasure
subsided
in
me
as
fast
as
did
the
accelerated
throb
of
my
pulses
.
<EOS>
A
child
can
not
quarrel
with
its
elders
,
as
I
had
done
;
can
not
give
its
furious
feelings
uncontrolled
play
,
as
I
had
given
mine
,
without
experiencing
afterwards
the
pang
of
remorse
and
the
chill
of
reaction
.
<EOS>
A
ridge
of
lighted
heath
,
alive
,
glancing
,
devouring
,
would
have
been
a
meet
emblem
of
my
mind
when
I
accused
and
menaced
Mrs.
Reed
:
the
same
ridge
,
black
and
blasted
after
the
flames
are
dead
,
would
have
represented
as
meetly
my
subsequent
condition
,
when
half
-
an
-
hour
's
silence
and
reflection
had
shown
me
the
madness
of
my
conduct
,
and
the
dreariness
of
my
hated
and
hating
position
.
  
<EOS>
Something
of
vengeance
I
had
tasted
for
the
first
time
;
as
aromatic
wine
it
seemed
,
on
swallowing
,
warm
and
racy
:
its
after
-
flavour
,
metallic
and
corroding
,
gave
me
a
sensation
as
if
I
had
been
poisoned
.
<EOS>
Willingly
would
I
now
have
gone
and
asked
Mrs.
Reed
's
pardon
;
but
I
knew
,
partly
from
experience
and
partly
from
instinct
,
that
was
the
way
to
make
her
repulse
me
with
double
scorn
,
thereby
re
-
exciting
every
turbulent
impulse
of
my
nature
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
fain
exercise
some
better
faculty
than
that
of
fierce
speaking
;
fain
find
nourishment
for
some
less
fiendish
feeling
than
that
of
sombre
indignation
.
<EOS>
I
took
a
book
 
some
Arabian
tales
;
I
sat
down
and
endeavoured
to
read
.
<EOS>
I
could
make
no
sense
of
the
subject
;
my
own
thoughts
swam
always
between
me
and
the
page
I
had
usually
found
fascinating
.
<EOS>
I
opened
the
glass
-
door
in
the
breakfast
-
room
:
<EOS>
the
shrubbery
was
quite
still
:
the
black
frost
reigned
,
unbroken
by
sun
or
breeze
,
through
the
grounds
.
<EOS>
I
covered
my
head
and
arms
with
the
skirt
of
my
frock
,
and
went
out
to
walk
in
a
part
of
the
plantation
which
was
quite
sequestrated
;
but
I
found
no
pleasure
in
the
silent
trees
,
the
falling
fir
-
cones
,
the
congealed
relics
of
autumn
,
russet
leaves
,
swept
by
past
winds
in
heaps
,
and
now
stiffened
together
.
<EOS>
I
leaned
against
a
gate
,
and
looked
into
an
empty
field
where
no
sheep
were
feeding
,
where
the
short
grass
was
nipped
and
blanched
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
grey
day
;
a
most
opaque
sky
,
"
onding
on
snaw
,
"
canopied
all
;
thence
flakes
felt
it
intervals
,
which
settled
on
the
hard
path
and
on
the
hoary
lea
without
melting
.
<EOS>
I
stood
,
a
wretched
child
enough
,
whispering
to
myself
over
and
over
again
,
"
What
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
All
at
once
I
heard
a
clear
voice
call
,
"
Miss
Jane
!
<EOS>
where
are
you
?
<EOS>
Come
to
lunch
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
Bessie
<EOS>
,
I
knew
well
enough
;
but
I
did
not
stir
;
her
light
step
came
tripping
down
the
path
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
naughty
little
thing
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
come
when
you
are
called
?
"
  
<EOS>
Bessie
's
presence
,
compared
with
the
thoughts
over
which
I
had
been
brooding
,
seemed
cheerful
;
even
though
,
as
usual
,
she
was
somewhat
cross
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
after
my
conflict
with
and
victory
over
Mrs.
Reed
,
I
was
not
disposed
to
care
much
for
the
nursemaid
's
transitory
anger
;
and
I
_
was
_
disposed
to
bask
in
her
youthful
lightness
of
heart
.
<EOS>
I
just
put
my
two
arms
round
her
and
said
,
"
Come
,
Bessie
!
<EOS>
do
n't
scold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
action
was
more
frank
and
fearless
than
any
I
was
habituated
to
indulge
in
:
somehow
it
pleased
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
strange
child
,
Miss
Jane
,
"
she
said
,
as
she
looked
down
at
me
;
"
a
little
roving
,
solitary
thing
:
<EOS>
and
you
are
going
to
school
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
nodded
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
wo
n't
you
be
sorry
to
leave
poor
Bessie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
Bessie
care
for
me
?
<EOS>
She
is
always
scolding
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
you
're
such
a
queer
,
frightened
,
shy
little
thing
.
<EOS>
You
should
be
bolder
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
to
get
more
knocks
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
But
you
are
rather
put
upon
<EOS>
,
that
's
certain
.
<EOS>
My
mother
said
,
when
she
came
to
see
me
last
week
,
that
she
would
not
like
a
little
one
of
her
own
to
be
in
your
place
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
come
in
,
and
I
've
some
good
news
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
you
have
,
Bessie
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Child
!
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
What
sorrowful
eyes
you
fix
on
me
!
<EOS>
Well
,
but
Missis
and
the
young
ladies
and
Master
John
are
going
out
to
tea
this
afternoon
,
and
you
shall
have
tea
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
'll
ask
cook
to
bake
you
a
little
cake
,
and
then
you
shall
help
me
to
look
over
your
drawers
;
for
I
am
soon
to
pack
your
trunk
.
<EOS>
Missis
intends
you
to
leave
Gateshead
in
a
day
or
two
,
and
you
shall
choose
what
toys
you
like
to
take
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bessie
,
you
must
promise
not
to
scold
me
any
more
till
I
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
will
;
but
mind
<EOS>
you
are
a
very
good
girl
,
and
do
n't
be
afraid
of
me
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
start
when
I
chance
to
speak
rather
sharply
;
it
's
so
provoking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
ever
be
afraid
of
you
again
,
Bessie
,
because
I
have
got
used
to
you
,
and
I
shall
soon
have
another
set
of
people
to
dread
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
dread
them
they
'll
dislike
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
you
do
,
Bessie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
dislike
you
,
Miss
;
I
believe
I
am
fonder
of
you
than
of
all
the
others
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
show
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
little
sharp
thing
!
<EOS>
you
've
got
quite
a
new
way
of
talking
.
<EOS>
What
makes
you
so
venturesome
and
hardy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
shall
soon
be
away
from
you
,
and
besides
"
 
I
was
going
to
say
something
about
what
had
passed
between
me
and
Mrs.
Reed
,
but
on
second
thoughts
I
considered
it
better
to
remain
silent
on
that
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
're
glad
to
leave
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
at
all
<EOS>
,
Bessie
;
indeed
,
just
now
I
'm
rather
sorry
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Just
now
!
and
rather
!
<EOS>
How
coolly
my
little
lady
says
it
!
<EOS>
I
dare
say
now
if
I
were
to
ask
you
for
a
kiss
<EOS>
you
would
n't
give
it
me
<EOS>
:
you
'd
say
you
'd
_
rather
_
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
kiss
you
and
welcome
:
<EOS>
bend
your
head
down
.
"
<EOS>
Bessie
stooped
;
we
mutually
embraced
,
and
I
followed
her
into
the
house
quite
comforted
.
<EOS>
That
afternoon
lapsed
in
peace
and
harmony
;
and
in
the
evening
Bessie
told
me
some
of
her
most
enchanting
stories
,
and
sang
me
some
of
her
sweetest
songs
.
<EOS>
Even
for
me
life
had
its
gleams
of
sunshine
.
    
<EOS>
Five
o'clock
had
hardly
struck
on
the
morning
of
the
19th
of
January
,
when
Bessie
brought
a
candle
into
my
closet
and
found
me
already
up
and
nearly
dressed
.
<EOS>
I
had
risen
half
-
an
-
hour
before
her
entrance
,
and
had
washed
my
face
,
and
put
on
my
clothes
by
the
light
of
a
half
-
moon
just
setting
,
whose
rays
streamed
through
the
narrow
window
near
my
crib
.
<EOS>
I
was
to
leave
Gateshead
that
day
by
a
coach
which
passed
the
lodge
gates
at
six
a.m.
Bessie
<EOS>
was
the
only
person
yet
risen
;
she
had
lit
a
fire
in
the
nursery
,
where
she
now
proceeded
to
make
my
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Few
children
can
eat
when
excited
with
the
thoughts
of
a
journey
;
nor
could
I.
Bessie
,
having
pressed
me
in
vain
to
take
a
few
spoonfuls
of
the
boiled
milk
and
bread
she
had
prepared
for
me
,
wrapped
up
some
biscuits
in
a
paper
and
put
them
into
my
bag
;
then
she
helped
me
on
with
my
pelisse
and
bonnet
,
and
wrapping
herself
in
a
shawl
,
she
and
I
left
the
nursery
.
<EOS>
As
we
passed
Mrs.
Reed
's
bedroom
,
she
said
,
"
Will
you
go
in
and
bid
Missis
good-
<EOS>
bye
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Bessie
:
she
came
to
my
crib
last
night
when
you
were
gone
down
to
supper
,
and
said
I
need
not
disturb
her
in
the
morning
,
or
my
cousins
either
;
and
she
told
me
to
remember
that
she
had
always
been
my
best
friend
,
and
to
speak
of
her
and
be
grateful
to
her
accordingly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
say
,
Miss
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
:
<EOS>
I
covered
my
face
with
the
bedclothes
,
and
turned
from
her
to
the
wall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
wrong
,
Miss
Jane
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
quite
right
,
Bessie
.
<EOS>
Your
Missis
has
not
been
my
friend
:
she
has
been
my
foe
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
O
Miss
Jane
!
<EOS>
do
n't
say
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
to
Gateshead
!
"
<EOS>
cried
I
,
as
we
passed
through
the
hall
and
went
out
at
the
front
door
.
  
<EOS>
The
moon
was
set
,
and
it
was
very
dark
;
Bessie
carried
a
lantern
,
whose
light
glanced
on
wet
steps
and
gravel
road
sodden
by
a
recent
thaw
.
<EOS>
Raw
and
chill
was
the
winter
morning
:
<EOS>
my
teeth
chattered
as
I
hastened
down
the
drive
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
light
in
the
porter
's
lodge
:
when
we
reached
it
,
we
found
the
porter
's
wife
just
kindling
her
fire
:
<EOS>
my
trunk
,
which
had
been
carried
down
the
evening
before
,
stood
corded
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
wanted
but
a
few
minutes
of
six
,
and
shortly
after
that
hour
had
struck
,
the
distant
roll
of
wheels
announced
the
coming
coach
;
I
went
to
the
door
and
watched
its
lamps
approach
rapidly
through
the
gloom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
going
by
herself
?
"
asked
the
porter
's
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
far
is
it
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Fifty
miles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
long
way
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
Mrs.
Reed
is
not
afraid
to
trust
her
so
far
alone
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
coach
drew
up
;
there
it
was
at
the
gates
with
its
four
horses
and
its
top
laden
with
passengers
:
the
guard
and
coachman
loudly
urged
haste
;
my
trunk
was
hoisted
up
;
I
was
taken
from
Bessie
's
neck
,
to
which
I
clung
with
kisses
.
  
<EOS>
"
Be
sure
and
take
good
care
of
her
,
"
cried
she
to
the
guard
,
as
he
lifted
me
into
the
inside
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
answer
:
the
door
was
slapped
to
,
a
voice
exclaimed
"
All
right
,
"
and
on
we
drove
.
<EOS>
Thus
was
I
severed
from
Bessie
and
Gateshead
;
thus
whirled
away
to
unknown
,
and
,
as
I
then
deemed
,
remote
and
mysterious
regions
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
but
little
of
the
journey
;
I
only
know
that
the
day
seemed
to
me
of
a
preternatural
length
,
and
that
we
appeared
to
travel
over
hundreds
of
miles
of
road
.
<EOS>
We
passed
through
several
towns
,
and
in
one
,
a
very
large
one
,
the
coach
stopped
;
the
horses
were
taken
out
,
and
the
passengers
alighted
to
dine
.
<EOS>
I
was
carried
into
an
inn
,
where
the
guard
wanted
me
to
have
some
dinner
;
but
,
as
I
had
no
appetite
,
he
left
me
in
an
immense
room
with
a
fireplace
at
each
end
,
a
chandelier
pendent
from
the
ceiling
,
and
a
little
red
gallery
high
up
against
the
wall
filled
with
musical
instruments
.
<EOS>
Here
I
walked
about
for
a
long
time
,
feeling
very
strange
,
and
mortally
apprehensive
of
some
one
coming
in
and
kidnapping
me
;
for
I
believed
in
kidnappers
,
their
exploits
having
frequently
figured
in
Bessie
's
fireside
chronicles
.
<EOS>
At
last
the
guard
returned
;
once
more
I
was
stowed
away
in
the
coach
,
my
protector
mounted
his
own
seat
,
sounded
his
hollow
horn
,
and
away
we
rattled
over
the
"
stony
street
"
of
L-
.
  
<EOS>
The
afternoon
came
on
wet
and
somewhat
misty
:
as
it
waned
into
dusk
,
I
began
to
feel
that
we
were
getting
very
far
indeed
from
Gateshead
:
we
ceased
to
pass
through
towns
;
the
country
changed
;
great
grey
hills
heaved
up
round
the
horizon
:
as
twilight
deepened
,
we
descended
a
valley
,
dark
with
wood
,
and
long
after
night
had
overclouded
the
prospect
,
I
heard
a
wild
wind
rushing
amongst
trees
.
  
<EOS>
Lulled
by
the
sound
,
I
at
last
dropped
asleep
;
I
had
not
long
slumbered
when
the
sudden
cessation
of
motion
awoke
me
;
the
coach
-
door
was
open
,
and
a
person
like
a
servant
was
standing
at
it
:
<EOS>
I
saw
her
face
and
dress
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
a
little
girl
called
Jane
Eyre
here
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
<EOS>
I
answered
"
Yes
,
"
and
was
then
lifted
out
;
my
trunk
was
handed
down
,
and
the
coach
instantly
drove
away
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
stiff
with
long
sitting
,
and
bewildered
with
the
noise
and
motion
of
the
coach
:
<EOS>
Gathering
my
faculties
,
I
looked
about
me
.
<EOS>
Rain
,
wind
,
and
darkness
filled
the
air
;
nevertheless
,
I
dimly
discerned
a
wall
before
me
and
a
door
open
in
it
;
through
this
door
I
passed
with
my
new
guide
:
she
shut
and
locked
it
behind
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
now
visible
a
house
or
houses
 
for
the
building
spread
far
 
with
many
windows
,
and
lights
burning
in
some
;
we
went
up
a
broad
pebbly
path
,
splashing
wet
,
and
were
admitted
at
a
door
;
then
the
servant
led
me
through
a
passage
into
a
room
with
a
fire
,
where
she
left
me
alone
.
  
<EOS>
I
stood
and
warmed
my
numbed
fingers
over
the
blaze
<EOS>
,
then
I
looked
round
;
there
was
no
candle
,
but
the
uncertain
light
from
the
hearth
showed
,
by
intervals
,
papered
walls
,
carpet
,
curtains
,
shining
mahogany
furniture
<EOS>
:
it
was
a
parlour
,
not
so
spacious
or
splendid
as
the
drawing
-
room
at
Gateshead
,
but
comfortable
enough
.
<EOS>
I
was
puzzling
to
make
out
the
subject
of
a
picture
on
the
wall
,
when
the
door
opened
,
and
an
individual
carrying
a
light
entered
;
another
followed
close
behind
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
was
a
tall
lady
with
dark
hair
,
dark
eyes
,
and
a
pale
and
large
forehead
;
her
figure
was
partly
enveloped
in
a
shawl
,
her
countenance
was
grave
,
her
bearing
erect
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
child
is
very
young
to
be
sent
alone
,
"
said
she
,
putting
her
candle
down
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
She
considered
me
attentively
for
a
minute
or
two
,
then
further
added
    
"
<EOS>
She
had
better
be
put
to
bed
soon
;
she
looks
tired
:
are
you
tired
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
placing
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
little
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
hungry
too
,
no
doubt
:
let
her
have
some
supper
before
she
goes
to
bed
,
Miss
Miller
.
<EOS>
Is
this
the
first
time
you
have
left
your
parents
to
come
to
school
,
my
little
girl
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
explained
to
her
that
I
had
no
parents
.
<EOS>
She
inquired
how
long
they
had
been
dead
:
then
how
old
I
was
,
what
was
my
name
,
whether
I
could
read
,
write
,
and
sew
a
little
:
then
she
touched
my
cheek
gently
with
her
forefinger
,
and
saying
,
"
She
hoped
I
should
be
a
good
child
,
"
dismissed
me
along
with
Miss
Miller
.
  
<EOS>
The
lady
I
had
left
might
be
about
twenty
-
nine
;
the
one
who
went
with
me
appeared
some
years
younger
:
<EOS>
the
first
impressed
me
by
her
voice
,
look
,
and
air
.
<EOS>
Miss
Miller
was
more
ordinary
;
ruddy
in
complexion
,
though
of
a
careworn
countenance
;
hurried
in
gait
and
action
,
like
one
who
had
always
a
multiplicity
of
tasks
on
hand
<EOS>
:
she
looked
,
indeed
,
what
I
afterwards
found
she
really
was
,
an
under
-
teacher
.
<EOS>
Led
by
her
,
I
passed
from
compartment
to
compartment
,
from
passage
to
passage
,
of
a
large
and
irregular
building
;
till
,
emerging
from
the
total
and
somewhat
dreary
silence
pervading
that
portion
of
the
house
we
had
traversed
,
we
came
upon
the
hum
of
many
voices
,
and
presently
entered
a
wide
,
long
room
,
with
great
deal
tables
,
two
at
each
end
,
on
each
of
which
burnt
a
pair
of
candles
,
and
seated
all
round
on
benches
,
a
congregation
of
girls
of
every
age
,
from
nine
or
ten
to
twenty
.
<EOS>
Seen
by
the
dim
light
of
the
dips
,
their
number
to
me
appeared
countless
,
though
not
in
reality
exceeding
eighty
;
they
were
uniformly
dressed
in
brown
stuff
frocks
of
quaint
fashion
,
and
long
holland
pinafores
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
hour
of
study
;
they
were
engaged
in
conning
over
their
to
-
morrow
's
task
,
and
the
hum
I
had
heard
was
the
combined
result
of
their
whispered
repetitions
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miller
signed
to
me
to
sit
on
a
bench
near
the
door
,
then
walking
up
to
the
top
of
the
long
room
she
cried
out
    
"
Monitors
,
collect
the
lesson
-
books
and
put
them
away
!
"
  
<EOS>
Four
tall
girls
arose
from
different
tables
,
and
going
round
,
gathered
the
books
and
removed
them
.
<EOS>
Miss
Miller
again
gave
the
word
of
command
    
"
Monitors
,
fetch
the
supper
-
trays
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
tall
girls
went
out
and
returned
presently
,
each
bearing
a
tray
,
with
portions
of
something
,
I
knew
not
<EOS>
what
,
arranged
thereon
,
and
a
pitcher
of
water
and
mug
in
the
middle
of
each
tray
.
<EOS>
The
portions
were
handed
round
;
those
who
liked
took
a
draught
of
the
water
,
the
mug
being
common
to
all
.
<EOS>
When
it
came
to
my
turn
,
I
drank
,
for
I
was
thirsty
,
but
did
not
touch
the
food
,
excitement
and
fatigue
rendering
me
incapable
of
eating
:
<EOS>
I
now
saw
,
however
,
that
it
was
a
thin
oaten
cake
shared
into
fragments
.
  
<EOS>
The
meal
over
,
prayers
were
read
by
Miss
Miller
,
and
the
classes
filed
off
,
two
and
two
,
upstairs
.
<EOS>
Overpowered
by
this
time
with
weariness
,
I
scarcely
noticed
what
sort
of
a
place
the
bedroom
was
,
except
that
,
like
the
schoolroom
,
I
saw
it
was
very
long
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
I
was
to
be
Miss
Miller
's
bed
-
fellow
;
she
helped
me
to
undress
:
when
laid
down
I
glanced
at
the
long
rows
of
beds
,
each
of
which
was
quickly
filled
with
two
occupants
;
in
ten
minutes
the
single
light
was
extinguished
,
and
amidst
silence
and
complete
darkness
I
fell
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
The
night
passed
rapidly
.
<EOS>
I
was
too
tired
even
to
dream
;
I
only
once
awoke
to
hear
the
wind
rave
in
furious
gusts
,
and
the
rain
fall
in
torrents
,
and
to
be
sensible
that
Miss
Miller
had
taken
her
place
by
my
side
.
<EOS>
When
I
again
unclosed
my
eyes
,
a
loud
bell
was
ringing
;
the
girls
were
up
and
dressing
;
day
had
not
yet
begun
to
dawn
,
and
a
rushlight
or
two
burned
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
too
rose
reluctantly
;
it
was
bitter
cold
,
and
I
dressed
as
well
as
I
could
for
shivering
,
and
washed
when
there
was
a
basin
at
liberty
,
which
did
not
occur
soon
,
as
there
was
but
one
basin
to
six
girls
,
on
the
stands
down
the
middle
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Again
the
bell
rang
:
all
formed
in
file
,
two
and
two
,
and
in
that
order
descended
the
stairs
and
entered
the
cold
and
dimly
lit
schoolroom
:
here
prayers
were
read
by
Miss
Miller
;
afterwards
she
called
out
    
"
Form
classes
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
great
tumult
succeeded
for
some
minutes
,
during
which
Miss
Miller
repeatedly
exclaimed
,
"
Silence
!
"
<EOS>
and
"
Order
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
it
subsided
,
I
saw
them
all
drawn
up
in
four
semicircles
,
before
four
chairs
,
placed
at
the
four
tables
;
all
held
books
in
their
hands
,
and
a
great
book
,
like
a
Bible
,
lay
on
each
table
,
before
the
vacant
seat
.
<EOS>
A
pause
of
some
seconds
succeeded
,
filled
up
by
the
low
,
vague
hum
of
numbers
;
Miss
Miller
walked
from
class
to
class
,
hushing
this
indefinite
sound
.
  
<EOS>
A
distant
bell
tinkled
:
immediately
three
ladies
entered
the
room
<EOS>
,
each
walked
to
a
table
and
took
her
seat
.
<EOS>
Miss
Miller
assumed
the
fourth
vacant
chair
,
which
was
that
nearest
the
door
,
and
around
which
the
smallest
of
the
children
were
assembled
:
to
this
inferior
class
I
was
called
,
and
placed
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Business
now
began
,
the
day
's
Collect
was
repeated
,
then
certain
texts
of
Scripture
were
said
,
and
to
these
succeeded
a
protracted
reading
of
chapters
in
the
Bible
,
which
lasted
an
hour
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
that
exercise
was
terminated
,
day
had
fully
dawned
.
<EOS>
The
indefatigable
bell
now
sounded
for
the
fourth
time
:
the
classes
were
marshalled
and
marched
into
another
room
to
breakfast
:
<EOS>
how
glad
I
was
to
behold
a
prospect
of
getting
something
to
eat
!
<EOS>
I
was
now
nearly
sick
from
inanition
,
having
taken
so
little
the
day
before
.
  
<EOS>
The
refectory
was
a
great
,
low
-
ceiled
,
gloomy
room
;
on
two
long
tables
smoked
basins
of
something
hot
,
which
,
however
,
to
my
dismay
,
sent
forth
an
odour
far
from
inviting
.
<EOS>
I
saw
a
universal
manifestation
of
discontent
when
the
fumes
of
the
repast
met
the
nostrils
of
those
destined
to
swallow
it
;
from
the
van
of
the
procession
,
the
tall
girls
of
the
first
class
,
rose
the
whispered
words
    
"
Disgusting
!
<EOS>
The
porridge
is
burnt
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Silence
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
a
voice
;
not
that
of
Miss
Miller
,
but
one
of
the
upper
teachers
,
a
little
and
dark
personage
,
smartly
dressed
,
but
of
somewhat
morose
aspect
,
who
installed
herself
at
the
top
of
one
table
,
while
a
more
buxom
lady
presided
at
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
looked
in
vain
for
her
<EOS>
I
had
first
seen
the
night
before
;
she
was
not
visible
:
Miss
Miller
occupied
the
foot
of
the
table
where
I
sat
,
and
a
strange
,
foreign
-
looking
,
elderly
lady
,
the
French
teacher
,
as
I
afterwards
found
,
took
the
corresponding
seat
at
the
other
board
.
<EOS>
A
long
grace
was
said
and
a
hymn
sung
;
then
a
servant
brought
in
some
tea
for
the
teachers
,
and
the
meal
began
.
  
<EOS>
Ravenous
,
and
now
very
faint
<EOS>
,
I
devoured
a
spoonful
or
two
of
my
portion
without
thinking
of
its
taste
;
but
the
first
edge
of
hunger
blunted
,
I
perceived
I
had
got
in
hand
a
nauseous
mess
;
burnt
porridge
is
almost
as
bad
as
rotten
potatoes
;
famine
itself
soon
sickens
over
it
.
<EOS>
The
spoons
were
moved
slowly
:
I
saw
each
girl
taste
her
food
and
try
to
swallow
it
;
but
in
most
cases
the
effort
was
soon
relinquished
.
<EOS>
Breakfast
was
over
,
and
none
had
breakfasted
.
<EOS>
Thanks
being
returned
for
what
we
had
not
got
,
and
a
second
hymn
chanted
,
the
refectory
was
evacuated
for
the
schoolroom
.
<EOS>
I
was
one
of
the
last
to
go
out
,
and
in
passing
the
tables
,
I
saw
one
teacher
take
a
basin
of
the
porridge
and
taste
it
;
she
looked
at
the
others
;
all
their
countenances
expressed
displeasure
,
and
one
of
them
,
the
stout
one
,
whispered
    
"
Abominable
stuff
!
<EOS>
How
shameful
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
before
lessons
again
began
,
during
which
the
schoolroom
was
in
a
glorious
tumult
;
for
that
space
of
time
it
seemed
to
be
permitted
to
talk
loud
and
more
freely
,
and
they
used
their
privilege
.
<EOS>
The
whole
conversation
ran
on
the
breakfast
,
which
one
and
all
abused
roundly
.
<EOS>
Poor
things
!
<EOS>
it
was
the
sole
consolation
they
had
.
<EOS>
Miss
Miller
was
now
the
only
teacher
in
the
room
:
a
group
of
great
girls
standing
about
her
spoke
with
serious
and
sullen
gestures
.
<EOS>
I
heard
the
name
of
Mr.
Brocklehurst
pronounced
by
some
lips
;
at
which
Miss
Miller
shook
her
head
disapprovingly
;
but
she
made
no
great
effort
to
check
the
general
wrath
;
doubtless
she
shared
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
A
clock
in
the
schoolroom
struck
nine
;
Miss
Miller
left
her
circle
,
and
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
cried
    
"
Silence
!
<EOS>
To
your
seats
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Discipline
prevailed
:
in
five
minutes
the
confused
throng
was
resolved
into
order
,
and
comparative
silence
quelled
the
Babel
clamour
of
tongues
.
<EOS>
The
upper
teachers
now
punctually
resumed
their
posts
:
but
still
,
all
seemed
to
wait
.
<EOS>
Ranged
on
benches
down
the
sides
of
the
room
,
the
eighty
girls
sat
motionless
and
erect
;
a
quaint
assemblage
they
appeared
,
all
with
plain
locks
combed
from
their
faces
,
not
a
curl
visible
;
in
brown
dresses
,
made
high
and
surrounded
by
a
narrow
tucker
about
the
throat
,
with
little
pockets
of
holland
(
shaped
something
like
a
Highlander
's
purse
)
tied
in
front
of
their
frocks
,
and
destined
to
serve
the
purpose
of
a
work
-
bag
:
all
,
too
,
wearing
woollen
stockings
and
country
-
made
shoes
,
fastened
with
brass
buckles
.
<EOS>
Above
twenty
of
those
clad
in
this
costume
were
full
-
grown
girls
,
or
rather
young
women
;
it
suited
them
ill
,
and
gave
an
air
of
oddity
even
to
the
prettiest
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
still
looking
at
them
,
and
also
at
intervals
examining
the
teachers
 
<EOS>
none
of
whom
precisely
pleased
me
;
for
the
stout
one
was
a
little
coarse
,
the
dark
one
not
a
little
fierce
,
the
foreigner
harsh
and
grotesque
,
and
Miss
Miller
,
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
looked
purple
,
weather
-
beaten
,
and
over
-
worked
 
<EOS>
when
,
as
my
eye
wandered
from
face
to
face
,
the
whole
school
rose
simultaneously
,
as
if
moved
by
a
common
spring
.
  
<EOS>
What
was
the
matter
?
<EOS>
I
had
heard
no
order
given
:
I
was
puzzled
.
<EOS>
Ere
I
had
gathered
my
wits
,
the
classes
were
again
seated
:
but
as
all
eyes
were
now
turned
to
one
point
,
mine
followed
the
general
direction
,
and
encountered
the
personage
who
had
received
me
last
night
.
<EOS>
She
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
long
room
,
on
the
hearth
;
for
there
was
a
fire
at
each
end
;
she
surveyed
the
two
rows
of
girls
silently
and
gravely
.
<EOS>
Miss
Miller
approaching
,
seemed
to
ask
her
a
question
,
and
having
received
her
answer
,
went
back
to
her
place
,
and
said
aloud
    
"
Monitor
of
the
first
class
,
fetch
the
globes
!
"
  
<EOS>
While
the
direction
was
being
executed
,
the
lady
consulted
moved
slowly
up
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
have
a
considerable
organ
of
veneration
,
for
I
retain
yet
the
sense
of
admiring
awe
with
which
my
eyes
traced
her
steps
.
<EOS>
Seen
now
,
in
broad
daylight
,
she
looked
tall
,
fair
,
and
shapely
;
brown
eyes
with
a
benignant
light
in
their
irids
,
and
a
fine
pencilling
of
long
lashes
round
,
relieved
the
whiteness
of
her
large
front
;
on
each
of
her
temples
<EOS>
her
hair
,
of
a
very
dark
brown
,
was
clustered
in
round
curls
,
according
to
the
fashion
of
those
times
,
when
neither
smooth
bands
nor
long
ringlets
were
in
vogue
;
her
dress
,
also
in
the
mode
of
the
day
,
was
of
purple
cloth
,
relieved
by
a
sort
of
Spanish
trimming
of
black
velvet
;
a
gold
watch
(
watches
were
not
so
common
then
as
now
)
shone
at
her
girdle
.
<EOS>
Let
the
reader
add
,
to
complete
the
picture
,
refined
features
;
a
complexion
,
if
pale
,
clear
;
and
a
stately
air
and
carriage
,
and
he
will
have
,
at
least
,
as
clearly
as
words
can
give
it
,
a
correct
idea
of
the
exterior
of
Miss
Temple
 
Maria
Temple
,
as
I
afterwards
saw
the
name
written
in
a
prayer
-
book
intrusted
to
me
to
carry
to
church
.
  
<EOS>
The
superintendent
of
Lowood
(
for
such
was
this
lady
)
having
taken
her
seat
before
a
pair
of
globes
placed
on
one
of
the
tables
,
summoned
the
first
class
round
her
,
and
commenced
giving
a
lesson
on
geography
;
the
lower
classes
were
called
by
the
teachers
:
repetitions
in
history
,
grammar
,
&
c.
,
went
on
for
an
hour
;
writing
and
arithmetic
succeeded
,
and
music
lessons
were
given
by
Miss
Temple
to
some
of
the
elder
girls
.
<EOS>
The
duration
of
each
lesson
was
measured
by
the
clock
,
which
at
last
struck
twelve
.
<EOS>
The
superintendent
rose
    
"
I
have
a
word
to
address
to
the
pupils
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
The
tumult
of
cessation
from
lessons
was
already
breaking
forth
,
but
it
sank
at
her
voice
.
<EOS>
She
went
on
    
<EOS>
"
You
had
this
morning
a
breakfast
which
you
could
not
eat
;
you
must
be
hungry
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
ordered
that
a
lunch
of
bread
and
cheese
shall
be
served
to
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
teachers
looked
at
her
with
a
sort
of
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
to
be
done
on
my
responsibility
,
"
she
added
,
in
an
explanatory
tone
to
them
,
and
immediately
afterwards
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
bread
and
cheese
was
presently
brought
in
and
distributed
,
to
the
high
delight
and
refreshment
of
the
whole
school
.
<EOS>
The
order
was
now
given
"
To
the
garden
!
"
<EOS>
Each
put
on
a
coarse
straw
bonnet
,
with
strings
of
coloured
calico
,
and
a
cloak
of
grey
frieze
.
<EOS>
I
was
similarly
equipped
,
and
,
following
the
stream
,
I
made
my
way
into
the
open
air
.
  
<EOS>
The
garden
was
a
wide
inclosure
,
surrounded
with
walls
so
high
as
to
exclude
every
glimpse
of
prospect
;
a
covered
verandah
ran
down
one
side
,
and
broad
walks
bordered
a
middle
space
divided
into
scores
of
little
beds
:
these
beds
were
assigned
as
gardens
for
the
pupils
to
cultivate
,
and
each
bed
had
an
owner
.
<EOS>
When
full
of
flowers
they
would
doubtless
look
pretty
;
but
now
,
at
the
latter
end
of
January
,
all
was
wintry
blight
and
brown
decay
.
<EOS>
I
shuddered
as
I
stood
and
looked
round
me
:
it
was
an
inclement
day
for
outdoor
exercise
;
not
positively
rainy
,
but
darkened
by
a
drizzling
yellow
fog
;
all
under
foot
was
still
soaking
wet
with
the
floods
of
yesterday
.
<EOS>
The
stronger
among
the
girls
ran
about
and
engaged
in
active
games
,
but
sundry
pale
and
thin
ones
herded
together
for
shelter
and
warmth
in
the
verandah
;
and
amongst
these
,
as
the
dense
mist
penetrated
to
their
shivering
frames
<EOS>
,
I
heard
frequently
the
sound
of
a
hollow
cough
.
  
<EOS>
As
yet
I
had
spoken
to
no
one
,
nor
did
anybody
seem
to
take
notice
of
me
<EOS>
;
I
stood
lonely
enough
:
but
to
that
feeling
of
isolation
<EOS>
I
was
accustomed
;
it
did
not
oppress
me
much
.
<EOS>
I
leant
against
a
pillar
of
the
verandah
,
drew
my
grey
mantle
close
about
me
,
and
,
trying
to
forget
the
cold
which
nipped
me
without
,
and
the
unsatisfied
hunger
which
gnawed
me
within
,
delivered
myself
up
to
the
employment
of
watching
and
thinking
.
<EOS>
My
reflections
were
too
undefined
and
fragmentary
to
merit
record
:
I
hardly
yet
knew
where
I
was
;
Gateshead
and
my
past
life
seemed
floated
away
to
an
immeasurable
distance
;
the
present
was
vague
and
strange
,
and
of
the
future
I
could
form
no
conjecture
.
<EOS>
I
looked
round
the
convent
-
like
garden
,
and
then
up
at
the
house
 
<EOS>
a
large
building
,
half
of
which
seemed
grey
and
old
,
the
other
half
quite
new
.
<EOS>
The
new
part
,
containing
the
schoolroom
and
dormitory
,
was
lit
by
mullioned
and
latticed
windows
,
which
gave
it
a
church
-
like
aspect
;
a
stone
tablet
over
the
door
bore
this
inscription
:
    
"
Lowood
Institution
.
 
<EOS>
This
portion
was
rebuilt
A.D.
,
by
Naomi
Brocklehurst
,
of
Brocklehurst
Hall
,
in
this
county
.
"
<EOS>
"
Let
your
light
so
shine
before
men
,
that
they
may
see
your
good
works
,
and
glorify
your
Father
which
is
in
heaven
.
"
 
<EOS>
St.
Matt
.
<EOS>
v.
16
.
  
<EOS>
I
read
these
words
over
and
over
again
:
I
felt
that
an
explanation
belonged
to
them
,
and
was
unable
fully
to
penetrate
their
import
.
<EOS>
I
was
still
pondering
the
signification
of
"
Institution
,
"
and
endeavouring
to
make
out
a
connection
between
the
first
words
and
the
verse
of
Scripture
,
when
the
sound
of
a
cough
close
behind
me
made
me
turn
my
head
.
<EOS>
I
saw
a
girl
sitting
on
a
stone
bench
near
;
she
was
bent
over
a
book
,
on
the
perusal
of
which
<EOS>
she
seemed
intent
:
from
where
I
stood
I
could
see
the
title
 
<EOS>
it
was
"
Rasselas
;
"
a
name
that
struck
me
as
strange
,
and
consequently
attractive
.
<EOS>
In
turning
a
leaf
she
happened
to
look
up
,
and
I
said
to
her
directly
    
"
Is
your
book
interesting
?
<EOS>
"
I
had
already
formed
the
intention
of
asking
her
to
lend
it
to
me
some
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
it
,
"
she
answered
,
after
a
pause
of
a
second
or
two
,
during
which
she
examined
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
about
?
<EOS>
"
I
continued
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
where
I
found
the
hardihood
thus
to
open
a
conversation
with
a
stranger
;
the
step
was
contrary
to
my
nature
and
habits
:
<EOS>
but
I
think
her
occupation
touched
a
chord
of
sympathy
somewhere
;
for
I
too
liked
reading
,
though
of
a
frivolous
and
childish
kind
;
I
could
not
digest
or
comprehend
the
serious
or
substantial
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
look
at
it
,
"
replied
the
girl
,
offering
me
the
book
.
  
<EOS>
I
did
so
;
a
brief
examination
convinced
me
that
the
contents
were
less
taking
than
the
title
:
"
Rasselas
"
looked
dull
to
my
trifling
taste
;
I
saw
nothing
about
fairies
,
nothing
about
genii
;
no
bright
variety
seemed
spread
over
the
closely
-
printed
pages
.
<EOS>
I
returned
it
to
her
;
she
received
it
quietly
,
and
without
saying
anything
she
was
about
to
relapse
into
her
former
studious
mood
:
again
I
ventured
to
disturb
her
    
"
Can
you
tell
me
what
the
writing
on
that
stone
over
the
door
means
?
<EOS>
What
is
Lowood
Institution
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
This
house
where
you
are
come
to
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
do
they
call
it
Institution
?
<EOS>
Is
it
in
any
way
different
from
other
schools
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
partly
a
charity
-
school
:
<EOS>
you
and
I
,
and
all
the
rest
of
us
,
are
charity
-
children
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
are
an
orphan
:
are
not
either
your
father
or
your
mother
dead
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Both
died
before
I
can
remember
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
all
the
girls
here
have
lost
either
one
or
both
parents
,
and
this
is
called
an
institution
for
educating
orphans
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
we
pay
no
money
?
<EOS>
Do
they
keep
us
for
nothing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
pay
,
or
our
friends
pay
,
fifteen
pounds
a
year
for
each
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
do
they
call
us
charity
-
children
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
fifteen
pounds
is
not
enough
for
board
and
teaching
,
and
the
deficiency
is
supplied
by
subscription
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
subscribes
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Different
benevolent
-
minded
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
this
neighbourhood
and
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
was
Naomi
Brocklehurst
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
lady
who
built
the
new
part
of
this
house
as
that
tablet
records
,
and
whose
son
overlooks
and
directs
everything
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
he
is
treasurer
and
manager
of
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
this
house
does
not
belong
to
that
tall
lady
who
wears
a
watch
,
and
who
said
we
were
to
have
some
bread
and

To
Miss
Temple

<EOS>
Oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
I
wish
it
did
:
she
has
to
answer
to
Mr.
Brocklehurst
for
all
she
does
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Brocklehurst
buys
all
our
food
and
all
our
clothes

"
  
"
Does
he
live
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
 
two
miles
off
,
at
a
large
hall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
a
good
man
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
clergyman
,
and
is
said
to
do
a
great
deal
of
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
say
that
tall
lady
was
called
Miss
Temple
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
are
the
other
teachers
called
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
one
with
red
cheeks
is
called
Miss
Smith
;
she
attends
to
the
work
,
and
cuts
out
 
for
we
make
our
own
clothes
,
our
frocks
,
and
pelisses
,
and
everything
;
the
little
one
with
black
hair
is
Miss
Scatcherd
;
she
teaches
history
and
grammar
,
and
hears
the
second
class
repetitions
;
and
the
one
who
wears
a
shawl
,
and
has
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
tied
to
her
side
with
a
yellow
ribband
,
is
Madame
Pierrot
:
<EOS>
she
comes
from
Lisle
,
in
France
,
and
teaches
French
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
like
the
teachers
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
like
the
little
black
one
,
and
the
Madame
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
pronounce
her
name
as
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Scatcherd
is
hasty
 
<EOS>
you
must
take
care
not
to
offend
her
;
Madame
Pierrot
is
not
a
bad
sort
of
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Miss
Temple
is
the
best
 
is
n't
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Temple
is
very
good
and
very
clever
;
she
is
above
the
rest
,
because
she
knows
far
more
than
they
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
been
long
here
?
"
  
"
Two
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Are
you
an
orphan
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
is
dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
happy
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ask
rather
too
many
questions
.
<EOS>
I
have
given
you
answers
enough
for
the
present
:
now
I
want
to
read
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
at
that
moment
the
summons
sounded
for
dinner
;
all
re
-
entered
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
odour
which
now
filled
the
refectory
was
scarcely
more
appetising
than
that
which
had
regaled
our
nostrils
at
breakfast
:
the
dinner
was
served
in
two
huge
tin
-
plated
vessels
,
whence
rose
a
strong
steam
redolent
of
rancid
fat
.
<EOS>
I
found
the
mess
to
consist
of
indifferent
potatoes
and
strange
shreds
of
rusty
meat
,
mixed
and
cooked
together
.
<EOS>
Of
this
preparation
a
tolerably
abundant
plateful
was
apportioned
to
each
pupil
.
<EOS>
I
ate
what
I
could
,
and
wondered
within
myself
whether
every
day
's
fare
would
be
like
this
.
  
<EOS>
After
dinner
,
we
immediately
adjourned
to
the
schoolroom
:
lessons
recommenced
,
and
were
continued
till
five
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
marked
event
of
the
afternoon
was
,
that
I
saw
the
girl
with
whom
I
had
conversed
in
the
verandah
dismissed
in
disgrace
by
Miss
Scatcherd
from
a
history
class
,
and
sent
to
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
large
schoolroom
.
<EOS>
The
punishment
seemed
to
me
in
a
high
degree
ignominious
,
especially
for
so
great
a
girl
 
<EOS>
she
looked
thirteen
or
upwards
.
<EOS>
I
expected
she
would
show
signs
of
great
distress
and
shame
;
but
to
my
surprise
she
neither
wept
nor
blushed
:
composed
,
though
grave
,
she
stood
,
the
central
mark
of
all
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
she
bear
it
so
quietly
 
so
firmly
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
asked
of
myself
.
<EOS>
"
Were
I
in
her
place
,
it
seems
to
me
I
should
wish
the
earth
to
open
and
swallow
me
up
.
<EOS>
She
looks
as
if
she
were
thinking
of
something
beyond
her
punishment
 
beyond
her
situation
:
of
something
not
round
her
nor
before
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
of
day
-
dreams
 
<EOS>
is
she
in
a
day
-
dream
now
?
<EOS>
Her
eyes
are
fixed
on
the
floor
,
but
I
am
sure
they
do
not
see
it
 
<EOS>
her
sight
seems
turned
in
,
gone
down
into
her
heart
:
she
is
looking
at
what
she
can
remember
,
I
believe
;
not
at
what
is
really
present
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
sort
of
a
girl
she
is
 
whether
good
or
naughty
.
"
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
five
p.m.
we
had
another
meal
,
consisting
of
a
small
mug
of
coffee
,
and
half
-
a
-
slice
of
brown
bread
.
<EOS>
I
devoured
my
bread
and
drank
my
coffee
with
relish
;
but
I
should
have
been
glad
of
as
much
more
 
<EOS>
I
was
still
hungry
.
<EOS>
Half
-
an
-
hour
's
recreation
succeeded
,
then
study
;
then
the
glass
of
water
and
the
piece
of
oat
-
cake
,
prayers
,
and
bed
.
<EOS>
Such
was
my
first
day
at
Lowood
.
    
<EOS>
The
next
day
commenced
as
before
,
getting
up
and
dressing
by
rushlight
;
but
this
morning
we
were
obliged
to
dispense
with
the
ceremony
of
washing
;
the
water
in
the
pitchers
was
frozen
.
<EOS>
A
change
had
taken
place
in
the
weather
the
preceding
evening
,
and
a
keen
north
-
east
wind
,
whistling
through
the
crevices
of
our
bedroom
windows
all
night
long
,
had
made
us
shiver
in
our
beds
,
and
turned
the
contents
of
the
ewers
to
ice
.
  
<EOS>
Before
the
long
hour
and
a
half
of
prayers
and
Bible
-
reading
was
over
,
I
felt
ready
to
perish
with
cold
.
<EOS>
Breakfast
-
time
came
at
last
,
and
this
morning
the
porridge
was
not
burnt
;
the
quality
was
eatable
,
the
quantity
small
.
<EOS>
How
small
my
portion
seemed
!
<EOS>
I
wished
it
had
been
doubled
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
day
I
was
enrolled
a
member
of
the
fourth
class
,
and
regular
tasks
and
occupations
were
assigned
me
:
<EOS>
hitherto
,
I
had
only
been
a
spectator
of
the
proceedings
at
Lowood
;
I
was
now
to
become
an
actor
therein
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
being
little
accustomed
to
learn
by
heart
,
the
lessons
appeared
to
me
both
long
and
difficult
;
the
frequent
change
from
task
to
task
,
too
,
bewildered
me
;
and
I
was
glad
when
,
about
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
Miss
Smith
put
into
my
hands
a
border
of
muslin
two
yards
long
,
together
with
needle
,
thimble
,
&
c.
,
and
sent
me
to
sit
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
schoolroom
,
with
directions
to
hem
the
same
.
<EOS>
At
that
hour
most
of
the
others
were
sewing
likewise
;
but
one
class
still
stood
round
Miss
Scatcherd
's
chair
reading
,
and
as
all
was
quiet
,
the
subject
of
their
lessons
could
be
heard
,
together
with
the
manner
in
which
each
girl
acquitted
herself
,
and
the
animadversions
or
commendations
of
Miss
Scatcherd
on
the
performance
.
<EOS>
It
was
English
history
:
among
the
readers
I
observed
my
acquaintance
of
the
verandah
:
at
the
commencement
of
the
lesson
,
her
place
had
been
at
the
top
of
the
class
,
but
for
some
error
of
pronunciation
,
or
some
inattention
to
stops
,
she
was
suddenly
sent
to
the
very
bottom
.
<EOS>
Even
in
that
obscure
position
,
Miss
Scatcherd
continued
to
make
her
an
object
of
constant
notice
:
she
was
continually
addressing
to
her
such
phrases
as
the
following
:
    
"
Burns
"
(
<EOS>
such
it
seems
was
her
name
:
the
girls
here
were
all
called
by
their
surnames
,
as
boys
are
elsewhere
)
,
"
Burns
,
you
are
standing
on
the
side
of
your
shoe
;
turn
your
toes
out
immediately
.
"
<EOS>
"
Burns
,
you
poke
your
chin
most
unpleasantly
;
draw
it
in
.
"
<EOS>
"
Burns
,
I
insist
on
your
holding
your
head
up
;
I
will
not
have
you
before
me
in
that
attitude
,
"
&
c.
&
c.
  
<EOS>
A
chapter
having
been
read
through
twice
,
the
books
were
closed
and
the
girls
examined
.
<EOS>
The
lesson
had
comprised
part
of
the
reign
of
Charles
I.
,
and
there
were
sundry
questions
about
tonnage
and
poundage
and
ship-
money
,
which
most
of
them
appeared
unable
to
answer
;
still
,
every
little
difficulty
was
solved
instantly
when
it
reached
Burns
:
her
memory
seemed
to
have
retained
the
substance
of
the
whole
lesson
,
and
she
was
ready
with
answers
on
every
point
.
<EOS>
I
kept
expecting
that
Miss
Scatcherd
would
praise
her
attention
;
but
,
instead
of
that
,
she
suddenly
cried
out
    
"
You
dirty
,
disagreeable
girl
!
<EOS>
you
have
never
cleaned
your
nails
this
morning
!
"
  
<EOS>
Burns
made
no
answer
:
I
wondered
at
her
silence
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
thought
I
,
"
does
she
not
explain
that
she
could
neither
clean
her
nails
nor
wash
her
face
,
as
the
water
was
frozen
?
"
  
<EOS>
My
attention
was
now
called
off
by
Miss
Smith
desiring
me
to
hold
a
skein
of
thread
:
while
she
was
winding
it
,
she
talked
to
me
from
time
to
time
,
asking
whether
I
had
ever
been
at
school
before
,
whether
I
could
mark
,
stitch
,
knit
,
&
c.
;
till
she
dismissed
me
,
I
could
not
pursue
my
observations
on
Miss
Scatcherd
's
movements
.
<EOS>
When
I
returned
to
my
seat
,
that
lady
was
just
delivering
an
order
of
which
I
did
not
catch
the
import
;
but
Burns
immediately
left
the
class
,
and
going
into
the
small
inner
room
where
the
books
were
kept
,
returned
in
half
a
minute
,
carrying
in
her
hand
a
bundle
of
twigs
tied
together
at
one
end
.
<EOS>
This
ominous
tool
she
presented
to
Miss
Scatcherd
with
a
respectful
curtesy
;
then
she
quietly
,
and
without
being
told
,
unloosed
her
pinafore
,
and
the
teacher
instantly
and
sharply
inflicted
on
her
neck
a
dozen
strokes
with
the
bunch
of
twigs
.
<EOS>
Not
a
tear
rose
to
Burns
'
eye
;
and
,
while
I
paused
from
my
sewing
,
because
my
fingers
quivered
at
this
spectacle
with
a
sentiment
of
unavailing
and
impotent
anger
,
not
a
feature
of
her
pensive
face
altered
its
ordinary
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hardened
girl
!
"
exclaimed
Miss
Scatcherd
;
"
nothing
can
correct
you
of
your
slatternly
habits
:
carry
the
rod
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Burns
obeyed
:
I
looked
at
her
narrowly
as
she
emerged
from
the
book
-
closet
;
she
was
just
putting
back
her
handkerchief
into
her
pocket
,
and
the
trace
of
a
tear
glistened
on
her
thin
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
The
play
-
hour
in
the
evening
I
thought
the
pleasantest
fraction
of
the
day
at
Lowood
:
the
bit
of
bread
,
the
draught
of
coffee
swallowed
at
five
o'clock
had
revived
vitality
,
if
it
had
not
satisfied
hunger
:
the
long
restraint
of
the
day
was
slackened
;
the
schoolroom
felt
warmer
than
in
the
morning
 
its
fires
being
allowed
to
burn
a
little
more
brightly
,
to
supply
,
in
some
measure
,
the
place
of
candles
,
not
yet
introduced
:
the
ruddy
gloaming
,
the
licensed
uproar
,
the
confusion
of
many
voices
gave
one
a
welcome
sense
of
liberty
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
I
had
seen
Miss
Scatcherd
flog
her
pupil
,
Burns
,
I
wandered
as
usual
among
the
forms
and
tables
and
laughing
groups
without
a
companion
,
yet
not
feeling
lonely
:
when
I
passed
the
windows
,
<EOS>
I
now
and
then
lifted
a
blind
,
and
looked
out
;
it
snowed
fast
,
a
drift
was
already
forming
against
the
lower
panes
;
putting
my
ear
close
to
the
window
,
I
could
distinguish
from
the
gleeful
tumult
within
,
the
disconsolate
moan
of
the
wind
outside
.
  
<EOS>
Probably
,
if
I
had
lately
left
a
good
home
and
kind
parents
,
this
would
have
been
the
hour
when
I
should
most
keenly
have
regretted
the
separation
;
that
wind
would
then
have
saddened
my
heart
;
this
obscure
chaos
would
have
disturbed
my
peace
!
<EOS>
as
it
was
,
I
derived
from
both
a
strange
excitement
,
and
reckless
and
feverish
,
I
wished
the
wind
to
howl
more
wildly
,
the
gloom
to
deepen
to
darkness
,
and
the
confusion
to
rise
to
clamour
.
  
<EOS>
Jumping
over
forms
,
and
creeping
under
tables
,
I
made
my
way
to
one
of
the
fire
-
places
;
there
,
kneeling
by
the
high
wire
fender
,
I
found
Burns
,
absorbed
,
silent
,
<EOS>
abstracted
from
all
round
her
by
the
companionship
of
a
book
,
which
she
read
by
the
dim
glare
of
the
embers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
still
"
Rasselas
'
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
coming
behind
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
have
just
finished
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
in
five
minutes
more
she
shut
it
up
.
<EOS>
I
was
glad
of
this
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
"
thought
I
,
"
I
can
perhaps
get
her
to
talk
.
<EOS>
"
I
sat
down
by
her
on
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
name
besides
Burns
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Helen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
come
a
long
way
from
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
come
from
a
place
farther
north
,
quite
on
the
borders
of
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
you
ever
go
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
;
but
nobody
can
be
sure
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
wish
to
leave
Lowood
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
why
should
I
?
<EOS>
I
was
sent
to
Lowood
to
get
an
education
;
and
it
would
be
of
no
use
going
away
until
I
have
attained
that
object
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
that
teacher
,
Miss
Scatcherd
,
is
so
cruel
to
you
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Cruel
?
<EOS>
Not
at
all
!
<EOS>
She
is
severe
:
she
dislikes
my
faults
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
I
were
in
your
place
I
should
dislike
her
;
I
should
resist
her
.
<EOS>
If
she
struck
me
with
that
rod
,
I
should
get
it
from
her
hand
;
I
should
break
it
under
her
nose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Probably
you
would
do
nothing
of
the
sort
:
but
if
you
did
,
Mr.
Brocklehurst
would
expel
you
from
the
school
;
that
would
be
a
great
grief
to
your
relations
.
<EOS>
It
is
far
better
to
endure
patiently
a
smart
which
nobody
feels
<EOS>
but
yourself
,
than
to
commit
a
hasty
action
whose
evil
consequences
will
extend
to
all
connected
with
you
;
and
besides
,
the
Bible
bids
us
return
good
for
evil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
then
it
seems
disgraceful
to
be
flogged
,
and
to
be
sent
to
stand
in
the
middle
of
a
room
full
of
people
;
and
you
are
such
a
great
girl
:
<EOS>
I
am
far
younger
than
you
,
and
I
could
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
it
would
be
your
duty
to
bear
it
,
if
you
could
not
avoid
it
:
it
is
weak
and
silly
to
say
you
_
can
not
bear
_
<EOS>
what
it
is
your
fate
to
be
required
to
bear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
heard
her
with
wonder
:
I
could
not
comprehend
this
doctrine
of
endurance
;
and
still
less
could
I
understand
or
sympathise
with
the
forbearance
she
expressed
for
her
chastiser
.
<EOS>
Still
I
felt
that
Helen
Burns
considered
things
by
a
light
invisible
to
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
suspected
she
might
be
right
<EOS>
and
I
wrong
;
<EOS>
but
I
would
not
ponder
the
matter
deeply
;
like
Felix
,
I
put
it
off
to
a
more
convenient
season
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
you
have
faults
,
Helen
:
what
are
they
?
<EOS>
To
me
you
seem
very
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
learn
from
me
,
not
to
judge
by
appearances
:
I
am
,
as
Miss
Scatcherd
said
,
slatternly
;
I
seldom
put
,
and
never
keep
,
things
,
in
order
;
I
am
careless
<EOS>
;
I
forget
rules
;
I
read
when
I
should
learn
my
lessons
;
I
have
no
method
;
and
sometimes
I
say
,
like
you
,
I
can
not
_
bear
_
to
be
subjected
to
systematic
arrangements
.
<EOS>
This
is
all
very
provoking
to
Miss
Scatcherd
,
who
is
naturally
neat
,
punctual
,
and
particular
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
cross
and
cruel
,
"
I
added
;
but
Helen
Burns
would
not
admit
my
addition
:
she
kept
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Miss
Temple
as
severe
to
you
as
Miss
Scatcherd
?
"
  
<EOS>
At
the
utterance
of
Miss
Temple
's
name
,
a
soft
smile
flitted
over
her
grave
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Temple
is
full
of
goodness
;
it
pains
her
to
be
severe
to
any
one
,
even
the
worst
in
the
school
:
she
sees
my
errors
,
and
tells
me
of
them
gently
;
and
,
if
I
do
anything
worthy
of
praise
,
she
gives
me
my
meed
liberally
.
<EOS>
One
strong
proof
of
my
wretchedly
defective
nature
is
,
that
even
her
expostulations
,
so
mild
,
so
rational
,
have
not
influence
to
cure
me
of
my
faults
;
and
even
her
praise
,
though
I
value
it
most
highly
,
can
not
stimulate
me
to
continued
care
and
foresight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
curious
,
"
said
I
,
"
it
is
so
easy
to
be
careful
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
For
_
you
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
it
is
.
<EOS>
I
observed
you
in
your
class
this
morning
,
and
saw
you
were
closely
attentive
:
your
thoughts
never
seemed
to
wander
while
Miss
Miller
explained
the
lesson
and
questioned
you
.
<EOS>
Now
,
mine
continually
rove
away
;
when
I
should
be
listening
to
Miss
Scatcherd
,
and
collecting
all
she
says
with
assiduity
,
often
I
lose
the
very
sound
of
her
voice
;
I
fall
into
a
sort
of
dream
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
think
I
am
in
Northumberland
,
and
that
the
noises
I
hear
round
me
are
the
bubbling
of
a
little
brook
which
runs
through
Deepden
,
near
our
house
;
 
then
,
<EOS>
when
it
comes
to
my
turn
to
reply
,
I
have
to
be
awakened
;
and
having
heard
nothing
of
what
was
read
for
listening
to
the
visionary
brook
,
I
have
no
answer
ready
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
how
well
you
replied
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
mere
chance
;
the
subject
on
which
we
had
been
reading
had
interested
me
.
<EOS>
This
afternoon
,
instead
of
dreaming
of
Deepden
,
I
was
wondering
how
a
man
who
wished
to
do
right
could
act
so
unjustly
and
unwisely
as
Charles
the
First
sometimes
did
;
and
I
thought
what
a
pity
it
was
that
,
with
his
integrity
and
conscientiousness
,
he
could
see
no
farther
than
the
prerogatives
of
the
crown
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
but
been
able
to
look
to
a
distance
,
and
see
how
what
they
call
the
spirit
of
the
age
was
tending
!
<EOS>
Still
,
I
like
Charles
 
<EOS>
I
respect
him
 
<EOS>
I
pity
him
,
poor
murdered
king
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
his
enemies
were
the
worst
:
they
shed
blood
they
had
no
right
to
shed
.
<EOS>
How
dared
they
kill
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Helen
was
talking
to
herself
now
<EOS>
:
she
had
forgotten
<EOS>
I
could
not
very
well
understand
her
 
that
I
was
ignorant
,
or
nearly
so
,
of
the
subject
she
discussed
.
<EOS>
I
recalled
her
to
my
level
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
Miss
Temple
teaches
you
,
do
your
thoughts
wander
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
certainly
,
not
often
;
because
Miss
Temple
has
generally
something
to
say
which
is
newer
than
my
own
reflections
;
her
language
is
singularly
agreeable
to
me
,
and
the
information
she
communicates
is
often
just
what
I
wished
to
gain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
with
Miss
Temple
you
are
good
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
in
a
passive
way
:
I
make
no
effort
;
I
follow
as
inclination
guides
me
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
merit
in
such
goodness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
great
deal
:
you
are
good
to
those
who
are
good
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
I
ever
desire
to
be
.
<EOS>
If
people
were
always
kind
and
obedient
to
those
who
are
cruel
and
unjust
,
the
wicked
people
would
have
it
all
their
own
way
:
they
would
never
feel
afraid
,
and
so
they
would
never
alter
,
but
would
grow
worse
and
worse
.
<EOS>
When
we
are
struck
at
without
a
reason
,
we
should
strike
back
again
very
hard
;
I
am
sure
we
should
 
so
hard
as
to
teach
the
person
who
struck
us
never
to
do
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
change
your
mind
,
I
hope
,
when
you
grow
older
:
<EOS>
as
yet
you
are
but
a
little
untaught
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
feel
this
,
Helen
;
I
must
dislike
those
who
,
whatever
I
do
to
please
them
,
persist
in
disliking
me
;
I
must
resist
those
who
punish
me
unjustly
.
<EOS>
It
is
as
natural
as
that
I
should
love
those
who
show
me
affection
,
or
submit
to
punishment
when
I
feel
it
is
deserved
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Heathens
and
savage
tribes
hold
that
doctrine
,
but
Christians
and
civilised
nations
disown
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
?
I
do
n't
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
violence
that
best
overcomes
hate
 
nor
vengeance
that
most
certainly
heals
injury
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
then
?
"
  
"
Read
the
New
Testament
,
and
observe
what
Christ
says
,
and
how
He
acts
;
make
His
word
your
rule
,
and
His
conduct
your
example
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
He
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Love
your
enemies
;
bless
them
that
curse
you
;
do
good
to
them
that
hate
you
and
despitefully
use
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
should
love
Mrs.
Reed
,
which
I
can
not
do
;
I
should
bless
her
son
John
,
which
is
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
her
turn
,
Helen
Burns
asked
me
to
explain
,
and
I
proceeded
forthwith
to
pour
out
,
in
my
own
way
,
the
tale
of
my
sufferings
and
resentments
.
<EOS>
Bitter
and
truculent
when
excited
<EOS>
,
I
spoke
as
I
felt
,
without
reserve
or
softening
.
  
<EOS>
Helen
heard
me
patiently
to
the
end
:
I
expected
she
would
then
make
a
remark
,
but
she
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
I
asked
impatiently
,
"
is
not
Mrs.
Reed
a
hard
-
hearted
,
bad
woman
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
unkind
to
you
,
no
doubt
;
because
you
see
,
she
dislikes
your
cast
of
character
,
as
Miss
Scatcherd
does
mine
;
but
how
minutely
you
remember
all
she
has
done
and
said
to
you
!
<EOS>
What
a
singularly
deep
impression
her
injustice
seems
to
have
made
on
your
heart
!
<EOS>
No
ill
-
usage
so
brands
its
record
on
my
feelings
.
<EOS>
Would
you
not
be
happier
if
you
tried
to
forget
her
severity
,
together
with
the
passionate
emotions
it
excited
?
<EOS>
Life
appears
to
me
too
short
to
be
spent
in
nursing
animosity
or
registering
wrongs
.
<EOS>
We
are
,
and
must
be
,
one
and
all
,
burdened
with
faults
in
this
world
:
but
the
time
will
soon
come
when
,
I
trust
,
we
shall
put
them
off
in
putting
off
our
corruptible
bodies
;
when
debasement
and
sin
will
fall
from
us
with
this
cumbrous
frame
of
flesh
,
and
only
the
spark
of
the
spirit
will
remain
,
 
the
impalpable
principle
of
light
and
thought
,
pure
as
when
it
left
the
Creator
to
inspire
the
creature
:
whence
it
came
it
will
return
;
perhaps
again
to
be
communicated
to
some
being
higher
than
man
 
perhaps
to
pass
through
gradations
of
glory
,
from
the
pale
human
soul
to
brighten
to
the
seraph
!
<EOS>
Surely
it
will
never
,
on
the
contrary
,
be
suffered
to
degenerate
from
man
to
fiend
?
<EOS>
No
;
I
can
not
believe
that
:
I
hold
another
creed
:
which
no
one
ever
taught
me
,
and
which
I
seldom
mention
;
but
in
which
I
delight
,
and
to
which
I
cling
:
<EOS>
for
it
extends
hope
to
all
:
it
makes
Eternity
a
rest
 
<EOS>
a
mighty
home
,
not
a
terror
and
an
abyss
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
with
this
creed
,
I
can
so
clearly
distinguish
between
the
criminal
and
his
crime
;
I
can
so
sincerely
forgive
the
first
while
I
abhor
the
last
:
with
this
creed
revenge
never
worries
my
heart
,
degradation
never
too
deeply
disgusts
me
,
injustice
never
crushes
me
too
low
:
I
live
in
calm
,
looking
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Helen
's
head
,
always
drooping
,
sank
a
little
lower
as
she
finished
this
sentence
.
<EOS>
I
saw
by
her
look
<EOS>
she
wished
no
longer
to
talk
to
me
,
but
rather
to
converse
with
her
own
thoughts
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
allowed
much
time
for
meditation
:
a
monitor
,
a
great
rough
girl
,
presently
came
up
,
exclaiming
in
a
strong
Cumberland
accent
    
"
Helen
Burns
,
if
you
do
n't
go
and
put
your
drawer
in
order
,
and
fold
up
your
work
this
minute
,
I
'll
tell
Miss
Scatcherd
to
come
and
look
at
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Helen
sighed
as
her
reverie
fled
,
and
getting
up
,
obeyed
the
monitor
without
reply
as
without
delay
.
    
<EOS>
My
first
quarter
at
Lowood
seemed
an
age
;
and
not
the
golden
age
either
;
it
comprised
an
irksome
struggle
with
difficulties
in
habituating
myself
to
new
rules
and
unwonted
tasks
.
<EOS>
The
fear
of
failure
in
these
points
harassed
me
worse
than
the
physical
hardships
of
my
lot
;
though
these
were
no
trifles
.
  
<EOS>
During
January
,
February
,
and
part
of
March
,
the
deep
snows
,
and
,
after
their
melting
,
the
almost
impassable
roads
,
prevented
our
stirring
beyond
the
garden
walls
,
except
to
go
to
church
;
but
within
these
limits
we
had
to
pass
an
hour
every
day
in
the
open
air
.
<EOS>
Our
clothing
was
insufficient
to
protect
us
from
the
severe
cold
:
we
had
no
boots
,
the
snow
got
into
our
shoes
and
melted
there
:
<EOS>
our
ungloved
hands
became
numbed
and
covered
with
chilblains
,
as
were
our
feet
:
I
remember
well
the
distracting
irritation
I
endured
from
this
cause
<EOS>
every
evening
,
when
my
feet
inflamed
;
and
the
torture
of
thrusting
the
swelled
,
raw
,
and
stiff
toes
into
my
shoes
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Then
the
scanty
supply
of
food
was
distressing
:
with
the
keen
appetites
of
growing
children
,
we
had
scarcely
sufficient
to
keep
alive
a
delicate
invalid
.
<EOS>
From
this
deficiency
of
nourishment
resulted
an
abuse
,
which
pressed
hardly
on
the
younger
pupils
:
whenever
the
famished
great
girls
had
an
opportunity
,
they
would
coax
or
menace
the
little
ones
out
of
their
portion
.
<EOS>
Many
a
time
I
have
shared
between
two
claimants
the
precious
morsel
of
brown
bread
distributed
at
tea
-
time
;
and
after
relinquishing
to
a
third
half
the
contents
of
my
mug
of
coffee
,
I
have
swallowed
the
remainder
with
an
accompaniment
of
secret
tears
,
forced
from
me
by
the
exigency
of
hunger
.
  
<EOS>
Sundays
were
dreary
days
in
that
wintry
season
.
<EOS>
We
had
to
walk
two
miles
to
Brocklebridge
Church
,
where
our
patron
officiated
.
<EOS>
We
set
out
cold
,
we
arrived
at
church
colder
:
during
the
morning
service
we
became
almost
paralysed
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
far
to
return
to
dinner
,
and
an
allowance
of
cold
meat
and
bread
,
in
the
same
penurious
proportion
observed
in
our
ordinary
meals
,
was
served
round
between
the
services
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
close
of
the
afternoon
service
we
returned
by
an
exposed
and
hilly
road
,
where
the
bitter
winter
wind
,
blowing
over
a
range
of
snowy
summits
to
the
north
,
almost
flayed
the
skin
from
our
faces
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
remember
Miss
Temple
walking
lightly
and
rapidly
along
our
drooping
line
,
her
plaid
cloak
,
which
the
frosty
wind
fluttered
,
gathered
close
about
her
,
and
encouraging
us
,
by
precept
and
example
,
to
keep
up
our
spirits
,
and
march
forward
,
as
she
said
,
"
like
stalwart
soldiers

The
other
teachers
,
poor
things
,
were
generally
themselves
too
much
dejected
to
attempt
the
task
of
cheering
others
.
  
<EOS>
How
we
longed
for
the
light
and
heat
of
a
blazing
fire
when
we
got
back
!
<EOS>
But
,
to
the
little
ones
at
least
,
this
was
denied
:
each
hearth
in
the
schoolroom
was
immediately
surrounded
by
a
double
row
of
great
girls
,
and
behind
them
the
younger
children
crouched
in
groups
,
wrapping
their
starved
arms
in
their
pinafores
.
  
<EOS>
A
little
solace
came
at
tea
-
time
,
in
the
shape
of
a
double
ration
of
bread
 
<EOS>
a
whole
,
instead
of
a
half
,
slice
 
with
the
delicious
addition
of
a
thin
scrape
of
butter
<EOS>
:
it
was
the
hebdomadal
treat
to
which
we
all
looked
forward
from
Sabbath
to
Sabbath
.
<EOS>
I
generally
contrived
to
reserve
a
moiety
of
this
bounteous
repast
for
myself
;
but
the
remainder
I
was
invariably
obliged
to
part
with
.
  
<EOS>
The
Sunday
evening
was
spent
in
repeating
,
by
heart
,
the
Church
Catechism
,
and
the
fifth
,
sixth
,
and
seventh
chapters
of
St.
Matthew
;
and
in
listening
to
a
long
sermon
,
read
by
Miss
Miller
,
whose
irrepressible
yawns
attested
her
weariness
.
<EOS>
A
frequent
interlude
of
these
performances
was
the
enactment
of
the
part
of
Eutychus
by
some
half
-
dozen
of
little
girls
,
who
,
overpowered
with
sleep
,
would
fall
down
,
if
not
out
of
the
third
loft
,
yet
off
the
fourth
form
,
and
be
taken
up
half
dead
.
<EOS>
The
remedy
was
,
to
thrust
them
forward
into
the
centre
of
the
schoolroom
,
and
oblige
them
to
stand
there
till
the
sermon
was
finished
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
their
feet
failed
them
,
and
they
sank
together
in
a
heap
;
they
were
then
propped
up
with
the
monitors
'
high
stools
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
alluded
to
the
visits
of
Mr.
Brocklehurst
;
and
indeed
that
gentleman
was
from
home
during
the
greater
part
of
the
first
month
after
my
arrival
;
perhaps
prolonging
his
stay
with
his
friend
the
archdeacon
:
his
absence
was
a
relief
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
say
that
I
had
my
own
reasons
for
dreading
his
coming
:
but
come
he
did
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
One
afternoon
(
I
had
then
been
three
weeks
at
Lowood
)
,
as
I
was
sitting
with
a
slate
in
my
hand
,
puzzling
over
a
sum
in
long
division
,
my
eyes
,
raised
in
abstraction
to
the
window
,
caught
sight
of
a
figure
just
passing
:
<EOS>
I
recognised
almost
instinctively
that
gaunt
outline
;
and
when
,
two
minutes
after
,
all
the
school
,
teachers
included
,
rose
_
en
<EOS>
masse
_
<EOS>
,
it
was
not
necessary
for
me
to
look
up
in
order
to
ascertain
whose
entrance
they
thus
greeted
.
<EOS>
A
long
stride
measured
the
schoolroom
,
and
presently
beside
Miss
Temple
,
who
herself
had
risen
,
stood
the
same
black
column
which
had
frowned
on
me
so
ominously
from
the
hearthrug
of
Gateshead
.
<EOS>
I
now
glanced
sideways
at
this
piece
of
architecture
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
was
right
:
it
was
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
buttoned
up
in
a
surtout
,
and
looking
longer
,
narrower
,
and
more
rigid
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
my
own
reasons
for
being
dismayed
at
this
apparition
;
too
well
I
remembered
the
perfidious
hints
given
by
Mrs.
Reed
about
my
disposition
,
&
c.
;
the
promise
pledged
by
Mr.
Brocklehurst
to
apprise
Miss
Temple
and
the
teachers
of
my
vicious
nature
.
<EOS>
All
along
I
had
been
dreading
the
fulfilment
of
this
promise
,
 
I
had
been
looking
out
daily
for
the
"
Coming
Man
,
"
whose
information
respecting
my
past
life
and
conversation
was
to
brand
me
as
a
bad
child
for
ever
:
now
there
he
was
.
  
<EOS>
He
stood
at
Miss
Temple
's
side
;
he
was
speaking
low
in
her
ear
:
<EOS>
I
did
not
doubt
he
was
making
disclosures
of
my
villainy
;
and
I
watched
her
eye
with
painful
anxiety
,
expecting
every
moment
to
see
its
dark
orb
turn
on
me
a
glance
of
repugnance
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
I
listened
too
;
and
as
I
happened
to
be
seated
quite
at
the
top
of
the
room
,
I
caught
most
of
what
he
said
:
its
import
relieved
me
from
immediate
apprehension
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
Miss
Temple
,
the
thread
I
bought
at
Lowton
will
do
;
it
struck
me
that
it
would
be
just
of
the
quality
for
the
calico
chemises
,
and
I
sorted
the
needles
to
match
.
<EOS>
You
may
tell
Miss
Smith
that
I
forgot
to
make
a
memorandum
of
the
darning
needles
,
but
she
shall
have
some
papers
sent
in
next
week
;
and
she
is
not
,
on
any
account
,
to
give
out
more
than
one
at
a
time
to
each
pupil
:
if
they
have
more
,
they
are
apt
to
be
careless
and
lose
them
.
<EOS>
And
,
O
ma'am
!
<EOS>
I
wish
the
woollen
stockings
were
better
looked
to
!
 
<EOS>
when
I
was
here
last
,
I
went
into
the
kitchen
-
garden
and
examined
the
clothes
drying
on
the
line
;
there
was
a
quantity
of
black
hose
in
a
very
bad
state
of
repair
:
from
the
size
of
the
holes
in
them
<EOS>
I
was
sure
they
had
not
been
well
mended
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
directions
shall
be
attended
to
,
sir
,
"
said
Miss
Temple
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
,
ma'am
,
"
he
continued
,
"
the
laundress
tells
me
some
of
the
girls
have
two
clean
tuckers
in
the
week
:
it
is
too
much
;
the
rules
limit
them
to
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
can
explain
that
circumstance
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Agnes
and
Catherine
Johnstone
were
invited
to
take
tea
with
some
friends
at
Lowton
last
Thursday
,
and
I
gave
them
leave
to
put
on
clean
tuckers
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Brocklehurst
nodded
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
for
once
it
may
pass
;
but
please
not
to
let
the
circumstance
occur
too
often
.
<EOS>
And
there
is
another
thing
which
surprised
me
;
I
find
,
in
settling
accounts
with
the
housekeeper
,
that
a
lunch
,
consisting
of
bread
and
cheese
,
has
twice
been
served
out
to
the
girls
during
the
past
fortnight
.
<EOS>
How
is
this
?
<EOS>
I
looked
over
the
regulations
,
and
I
find
no
such
meal
as
lunch
mentioned
.
<EOS>
Who
introduced
this
innovation
?
<EOS>
and
by
what
authority
?
"
  
"
I
must
be
responsible
for
the
circumstance
,
sir
,
"
replied
Miss
Temple
:
<EOS>
"
the
breakfast
was
so
ill
prepared
that
the
pupils
could
not
possibly
eat
it
;
and
I
dared
not
allow
them
to
remain
fasting
till
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
allow
me
an
instant
.
<EOS>
You
are
aware
that
my
plan
in
bringing
up
these
girls
is
,
not
to
accustom
them
to
habits
of
luxury
and
indulgence
,
but
to
render
them
hardy
,
patient
,
self
-
denying
.
<EOS>
Should
any
little
accidental
disappointment
of
the
appetite
occur
,
such
as
the
spoiling
of
a
meal
,
the
under
or
the
over
dressing
of
a
dish
,
the
incident
ought
not
to
be
neutralised
by
replacing
with
something
more
delicate
the
comfort
lost
,
thus
pampering
the
body
and
obviating
the
aim
of
this
institution
;
it
ought
to
be
improved
to
the
spiritual
edification
of
the
pupils
,
by
encouraging
them
to
evince
fortitude
under
temporary
privation
.
<EOS>
A
brief
address
on
those
occasions
would
not
be
mistimed
,
wherein
a
judicious
instructor
would
take
the
opportunity
of
referring
to
the
sufferings
of
the
primitive
Christians
;
to
the
torments
of
martyrs
;
to
the
exhortations
of
our
blessed
Lord
Himself
,
calling
upon
His
disciples
to
take
up
their
cross
and
follow
Him
;
to
His
warnings
that
man
shall
not
live
by
bread
alone
,
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
God
;
to
His
divine
consolations
,
"
If
ye
suffer
hunger
or
thirst
for
My
sake
,
happy
are
ye
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
madam
,
when
you
put
bread
and
cheese
,
instead
of
burnt
porridge
,
into
these
children
's
mouths
,
you
may
indeed
feed
their
vile
bodies
,
but
you
little
think
how
you
starve
their
immortal
souls
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Brocklehurst
again
paused
 
perhaps
overcome
by
his
feelings
.
<EOS>
Miss
Temple
had
looked
down
when
he
first
began
to
speak
to
her
;
but
she
now
gazed
straight
before
her
,
and
her
face
,
naturally
pale
as
marble
,
appeared
to
be
assuming
also
the
coldness
and
fixity
of
that
material
;
especially
her
mouth
,
closed
as
if
it
would
have
required
a
sculptor
's
chisel
to
open
it
,
and
her
brow
settled
gradually
into
petrified
severity
.
  
<EOS>
Meantime
,
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
standing
on
the
hearth
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
,
majestically
surveyed
the
whole
school
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
his
eye
gave
a
blink
,
as
if
it
had
met
something
that
either
dazzled
or
shocked
its
pupil
;
turning
<EOS>
,
he
said
in
more
rapid
accents
than
he
had
hitherto
used
    
"
Miss
Temple
,
Miss
Temple
,
what
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
what
_
is
that
girl
with
curled
hair
?
<EOS>
Red
hair
,
ma'am
,
curled
 
curled
all
over
?
"
<EOS>
And
extending
his
cane
he
pointed
to
the
awful
object
,
his
hand
shaking
as
he
did
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
Julia
Severn
,
"
replied
Miss
Temple
,
very
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Julia
Severn
,
ma'am
!
<EOS>
And
why
has
she
,
or
any
other
,
curled
hair
?
<EOS>
Why
,
in
defiance
of
every
precept
and
principle
of
this
house
,
does
she
conform
to
the
world
so
openly
 
here
in
an
evangelical
,
charitable
establishment
 
as
to
wear
her
hair
one
mass
of
curls
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Julia
's
hair
curls
naturally
,
"
returned
Miss
Temple
,
still
more
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Naturally
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
we
are
not
to
conform
to
nature
;
I
wish
these
girls
to
be
the
children
of
Grace
:
and
why
that
abundance
?
<EOS>
I
have
again
and
again
intimated
that
I
desire
the
hair
to
be
arranged
closely
,
modestly
,
plainly
.
<EOS>
Miss
Temple
,
that
girl
's
hair
must
be
cut
off
entirely
;
I
will
send
a
barber
to
-
morrow
:
and
I
see
others
who
have
far
too
much
of
the
excrescence
 
<EOS>
that
tall
girl
,
tell
her
to
turn
round
.
<EOS>
Tell
all
the
first
form
to
rise
up
and
direct
their
faces
to
the
wall
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Temple
passed
her
handkerchief
over
her
lips
,
as
if
to
smooth
away
the
involuntary
smile
that
curled
them
;
she
gave
the
order
,
however
,
and
when
the
first
class
could
take
in
what
was
required
of
them
,
they
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Leaning
a
little
back
on
my
bench
,
I
could
see
the
looks
and
grimaces
with
which
they
commented
on
this
manoeuvre
:
it
was
a
pity
Mr.
Brocklehurst
could
not
see
them
too
;
he
would
perhaps
have
felt
that
,
whatever
he
might
do
with
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
platter
,
the
inside
was
further
beyond
his
interference
than
he
imagined
.
  
<EOS>
He
scrutinised
the
reverse
of
these
living
medals
some
five
minutes
,
then
pronounced
sentence
.
<EOS>
These
words
fell
like
the
knell
of
doom
    
"
All
those
top
-
knots
must
be
cut
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Temple
seemed
to
remonstrate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
I
have
a
Master
to
serve
whose
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
:
my
mission
is
to
mortify
in
these
girls
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
;
to
teach
them
to
clothe
themselves
with
shame
-
facedness
and
sobriety
,
not
with
braided
hair
and
costly
apparel
;
and
each
of
the
young
persons
before
us
has
a
string
of
hair
twisted
in
plaits
which
vanity
itself
might
have
woven
;
these
,
I
repeat
,
must
be
cut
off
;
think
of
the
time
wasted
,
of
 
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Brocklehurst
was
here
interrupted
:
three
other
visitors
,
ladies
,
now
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
They
ought
to
have
come
a
little
sooner
to
have
heard
his
lecture
on
dress
,
for
they
were
splendidly
attired
in
velvet
,
silk
,
and
furs
.
<EOS>
The
two
younger
of
the
trio
(
fine
girls
of
sixteen
and
seventeen
)
had
grey
beaver
hats
,
then
in
fashion
,
shaded
with
ostrich
plumes
,
and
from
under
the
brim
of
this
graceful
head
-
dress
fell
a
profusion
of
light
tresses
,
elaborately
curled
;
the
elder
lady
was
enveloped
in
a
costly
velvet
shawl
,
trimmed
with
ermine
,
and
she
wore
a
false
front
of
French
curls
.
  
<EOS>
These
ladies
were
deferentially
received
by
Miss
Temple
,
as
Mrs.
and
the
Misses
Brocklehurst
,
and
conducted
to
seats
of
honour
at
the
top
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
seems
they
had
come
in
the
carriage
with
their
reverend
relative
,
and
had
been
conducting
a
rummaging
scrutiny
of
the
room
upstairs
,
while
he
transacted
business
with
the
housekeeper
,
questioned
the
laundress
,
and
lectured
the
superintendent
.
<EOS>
They
now
proceeded
to
address
divers
remarks
and
reproofs
to
Miss
Smith
,
who
was
charged
with
the
care
of
the
linen
and
the
inspection
of
the
dormitories
:
but
I
had
no
time
to
listen
to
what
they
said
;
other
matters
called
off
and
enchanted
my
attention
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
while
gathering
up
the
discourse
of
Mr.
Brocklehurst
and
Miss
Temple
,
I
had
not
,
at
the
same
time
,
neglected
precautions
to
secure
my
personal
safety
;
which
I
thought
would
be
effected
,
if
I
could
only
elude
observation
.
<EOS>
To
this
end
,
I
had
sat
well
back
on
the
form
,
and
while
seeming
to
be
busy
with
my
sum
,
had
held
my
slate
in
such
a
manner
as
to
conceal
my
face
:
I
might
have
escaped
notice
,
had
not
my
treacherous
slate
somehow
happened
to
slip
from
my
hand
,
and
falling
with
an
obtrusive
crash
,
directly
drawn
every
eye
upon
me
;
I
knew
it
was
all
over
now
,
and
,
as
I
stooped
to
pick
up
the
two
fragments
of
slate
,
I
rallied
my
forces
for
the
worst
.
<EOS>
It
came
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
careless
girl
!
"
said
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
and
immediately
after
 
"
It
is
the
new
pupil
<EOS>
,
I
perceive
.
"
<EOS>
And
before
I
could
draw
breath
,
"
I
must
not
forget
I
have
a
word
to
say
respecting
her
.
"
<EOS>
Then
aloud
:
how
loud
it
seemed
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
Let
the
child
who
broke
her
slate
come
forward
!
"
  
<EOS>
Of
my
own
accord
I
could
not
have
stirred
;
I
was
paralysed
:
but
the
two
great
girls
who
sit
on
each
side
of
me
,
set
me
on
my
legs
and
pushed
me
towards
the
dread
judge
,
and
then
Miss
Temple
gently
assisted
me
to
his
very
feet
,
and
I
caught
her
whispered
counsel
    
"
Do
n't
be
afraid
,
<EOS>
Jane
,
I
saw
it
was
an
accident
;
you
shall
not
be
punished
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
kind
whisper
went
to
my
heart
like
a
dagger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Another
minute
,
and
she
will
despise
me
for
a
hypocrite
,
"
thought
I
;
and
an
impulse
of
fury
against
Reed
,
Brocklehurst
,
and
Co.
bounded
in
my
pulses
at
the
conviction
.
<EOS>
I
was
no
Helen
Burns
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fetch
that
stool
,
"
said
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
pointing
to
a
very
high
one
from
which
a
monitor
had
just
risen
:
it
was
brought
.
  
<EOS>
"
Place
the
child
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
I
was
placed
there
,
<EOS>
by
whom
I
do
n't
know
:
<EOS>
I
was
in
no
condition
to
note
particulars
;
I
was
only
aware
that
they
had
hoisted
me
up
to
the
height
of
Mr.
Brocklehurst
's
nose
,
that
he
was
within
a
yard
of
me
,
and
that
a
spread
of
shot
orange
and
purple
silk
pelisses
and
a
cloud
of
silvery
plumage
extended
and
waved
below
me
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Brocklehurst
hemmed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ladies
,
"
said
he
,
turning
to
his
family
,
"
Miss
Temple
,
teachers
,
and
children
<EOS>
,
you
all
see
this
girl
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Of
course
they
did
;
for
I
felt
their
eyes
directed
like
burning
-
glasses
against
my
scorched
skin
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
she
is
yet
young
;
you
observe
she
possesses
the
ordinary
form
of
childhood
;
God
has
graciously
given
her
the
shape
that
He
has
given
to
all
of
us
;
no
signal
deformity
points
her
out
as
a
marked
character
.
<EOS>
Who
would
think
that
the
Evil
One
had
already
found
a
servant
and
agent
in
her
?
<EOS>
Yet
such
,
I
grieve
to
say
,
is
the
case
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
pause
 
in
which
I
began
to
steady
the
palsy
of
my
nerves
,
and
to
feel
that
the
Rubicon
was
passed
;
and
that
the
trial
,
no
longer
to
be
shirked
,
must
be
firmly
sustained
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
children
,
"
pursued
the
black
marble
clergyman
,
with
pathos
,
"
this
is
a
sad
,
a
melancholy
occasion
;
for
it
becomes
my
duty
to
warn
you
,
that
this
girl
,
who
might
be
one
of
God
's
own
lambs
,
is
a
little
castaway
:
not
a
member
of
the
true
flock
,
but
evidently
an
interloper
and
an
alien
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
on
your
guard
against
her
;
you
must
shun
her
example
;
if
necessary
,
avoid
her
company
,
exclude
her
from
your
sports
,
and
shut
her
out
from
your
converse
.
<EOS>
Teachers
,
you
must
watch
her
:
keep
your
eyes
on
her
movements
,
weigh
well
her
words
,
scrutinise
her
actions
,
punish
her
body
to
save
her
soul
:
<EOS>
if
,
indeed
,
such
salvation
be
possible
,
for
(
my
tongue
falters
while
I
tell
it
)
<EOS>
this
girl
,
this
child
,
the
native
of
a
Christian
land
,
worse
than
many
a
little
heathen
who
says
its
prayers
to
Brahma
and
kneels
before
Juggernaut
 
<EOS>
this
girl
is
 
a
liar
!
"
  
<EOS>
Now
came
a
pause
of
ten
minutes
,
during
which
I
,
by
this
time
in
perfect
possession
of
my
wits
,
observed
all
the
female
Brocklehursts
produce
their
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
and
apply
them
to
their
optics
,
while
the
elderly
lady
swayed
herself
to
and
fro
,
and
the
two
younger
ones
whispered
,
"
How
shocking
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Brocklehurst
resumed
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
I
learned
from
her
benefactress
;
from
the
pious
and
charitable
lady
who
adopted
her
in
her
orphan
state
,
reared
her
as
her
own
daughter
,
and
whose
kindness
,
whose
generosity
the
unhappy
girl
repaid
by
an
ingratitude
so
bad
,
so
dreadful
,
that
at
last
her
excellent
patroness
was
obliged
to
separate
her
from
her
own
young
ones
,
fearful
lest
her
vicious
example
should
contaminate
their
purity
:
she
has
sent
her
here
to
be
healed
,
even
as
the
Jews
of
old
sent
their
diseased
to
the
troubled
pool
of
Bethesda
;
and
,
teachers
,
superintendent
<EOS>
,
I
beg
of
you
not
to
allow
the
waters
to
stagnate
round
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
sublime
conclusion
,
Mr.
Brocklehurst
adjusted
the
top
button
of
his
surtout
,
muttered
something
to
his
family
,
who
rose
,
bowed
to
Miss
Temple
,
and
then
all
the
great
people
sailed
in
state
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
Turning
at
the
door
,
my
judge
said
    
"
Let
her
stand
half
-
an
-
hour
longer
on
that
stool
,
and
let
no
one
speak
to
her
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
I
,
then
,
mounted
aloft
;
I
,
who
had
said
I
could
not
bear
the
shame
of
standing
on
my
natural
feet
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
was
now
exposed
to
general
view
on
a
pedestal
of
infamy
.
<EOS>
What
my
sensations
were
no
language
can
describe
;
but
just
as
they
all
rose
,
stifling
my
breath
and
constricting
my
throat
,
a
girl
came
up
and
passed
me
:
in
passing
,
she
lifted
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
What
a
strange
light
inspired
them
!
<EOS>
What
an
extraordinary
sensation
that
ray
sent
through
me
!
<EOS>
How
the
new
feeling
bore
me
up
!
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
a
martyr
,
a
hero
,
had
passed
a
slave
or
victim
,
and
imparted
strength
in
the
transit
.
<EOS>
I
mastered
the
rising
hysteria
,
lifted
up
my
head
,
and
took
a
firm
stand
on
the
stool
.
<EOS>
Helen
Burns
asked
some
slight
question
about
her
work
of
Miss
Smith
,
was
chidden
for
the
triviality
of
the
inquiry
,
returned
to
her
place
,
and
smiled
at
me
as
she
again
went
by
.
<EOS>
What
a
smile
!
<EOS>
I
remember
it
now
,
and
I
know
that
it
was
the
effluence
of
fine
intellect
,
of
true
courage
;
it
lit
up
her
marked
lineaments
,
her
thin
face
,
her
sunken
grey
eye
,
like
a
reflection
from
the
aspect
of
an
angel
.
<EOS>
Yet
at
that
moment
Helen
Burns
wore
on
her
arm
"
the
untidy
badge
;
<EOS>
"
scarcely
an
hour
ago
I
had
heard
her
condemned
by
Miss
Scatcherd
to
a
dinner
of
bread
and
water
on
the
morrow
because
she
had
blotted
an
exercise
in
copying
it
out
.
<EOS>
Such
is
the
imperfect
nature
of
man
!
<EOS>
such
spots
are
there
on
the
disc
of
the
clearest
planet
;
and
eyes
like
Miss
Scatcherd
's
can
only
see
those
minute
defects
,
and
are
blind
to
the
full
brightness
of
the
orb
.
    
<EOS>
Ere
the
half
-
hour
ended
,
five
o'clock
struck
;
school
was
dismissed
,
and
all
were
gone
into
the
refectory
to
tea
.
<EOS>
I
now
ventured
to
descend
:
it
was
deep
dusk
;
I
retired
into
a
corner
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
The
spell
by
which
I
had
been
so
far
supported
began
to
dissolve
;
reaction
took
place
,
and
soon
,
so
overwhelming
was
the
grief
that
seized
me
<EOS>
,
I
sank
prostrate
with
my
face
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Now
I
wept
:
<EOS>
Helen
Burns
was
not
here
;
nothing
sustained
me
;
left
to
myself
<EOS>
I
abandoned
myself
,
and
my
tears
watered
the
boards
.
<EOS>
I
had
meant
to
be
so
good
,
and
to
do
so
much
at
Lowood
:
to
make
so
many
friends
,
to
earn
respect
and
win
affection
.
<EOS>
Already
I
had
made
visible
progress
:
that
very
morning
I
had
reached
the
head
of
my
class
;
Miss
Miller
had
praised
me
warmly
;
Miss
Temple
had
smiled
approbation
;
she
had
promised
to
teach
me
drawing
,
and
to
let
me
learn
French
,
if
I
continued
to
make
similar
improvement
two
months
longer
:
<EOS>
and
then
I
was
well
received
by
my
fellow
-
pupils
;
treated
as
an
equal
by
those
of
my
own
age
,
and
not
molested
by
any
;
now
,
here
I
lay
again
crushed
and
trodden
on
;
and
could
I
ever
rise
more
?
  
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
I
thought
;
and
ardently
I
wished
to
die
.
<EOS>
While
sobbing
out
this
wish
in
broken
accents
,
some
one
approached
:
I
started
up
 
again
<EOS>
Helen
Burns
was
near
me
;
the
fading
fires
just
showed
her
coming
up
the
long
,
vacant
room
;
she
brought
my
coffee
and
bread
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
eat
something
,
"
she
said
;
but
I
put
both
away
from
me
,
feeling
as
if
a
drop
or
a
crumb
would
have
choked
me
in
my
present
condition
.
<EOS>
Helen
regarded
me
,
probably
with
surprise
:
I
could
not
now
abate
my
agitation
,
though
I
tried
hard
;
I
continued
to
weep
aloud
.
<EOS>
She
sat
down
on
the
ground
near
me
,
embraced
her
knees
with
her
arms
,
and
rested
her
head
upon
them
;
in
that
attitude
she
remained
silent
as
an
Indian
.
<EOS>
I
was
the
first
who
spoke
    
"
Helen
<EOS>
,
why
do
you
stay
with
a
girl
whom
everybody
believes
to
be
a
liar
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Everybody
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
Why
,
there
are
only
eighty
people
who
have
heard
you
called
so
,
and
the
world
contains
hundreds
of
millions
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
what
have
I
to
do
with
millions
?
<EOS>
The
eighty
,
I
know
,
despise
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
you
are
mistaken
:
probably
not
one
in
the
school
<EOS>
either
despises
or
dislikes
you
:
<EOS>
many
,
I
am
sure
,
pity
you
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
they
pity
me
after
what
Mr.
Brocklehurst
has
said
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Brocklehurst
is
not
a
god
:
nor
is
he
even
a
great
and
admired
man
:
he
is
little
liked
here
;
he
never
took
steps
to
make
himself
liked
.
<EOS>
Had
he
treated
you
as
an
especial
favourite
,
you
would
have
found
enemies
,
declared
or
covert
,
all
around
you
;
as
it
is
,
the
greater
number
would
offer
you
sympathy
if
they
dared
.
<EOS>
Teachers
and
pupils
may
look
coldly
on
you
for
a
day
or
two
,
but
friendly
feelings
are
concealed
in
their
hearts
;
and
if
you
persevere
in
doing
well
,
these
feelings
will
ere
long
appear
so
much
the
more
evidently
for
their
temporary
suppression
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
Jane
"
 
she
paused
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Helen
?
"
said
I
,
putting
my
hand
into
hers
<EOS>
:
she
chafed
my
fingers
gently
to
warm
them
,
and
went
on
    
"
If
all
the
world
hated
you
,
and
believed
you
wicked
,
while
your
own
conscience
approved
you
,
and
absolved
you
from
guilt
,
you
would
not
be
without
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
<EOS>
;
I
know
I
should
think
well
of
myself
;
but
that
is
not
enough
:
if
others
do
n't
love
me
I
would
rather
die
than
live
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
be
solitary
and
hated
,
Helen
.
<EOS>
Look
here
;
to
gain
some
real
affection
from
you
,
or
Miss
Temple
,
or
any
other
whom
I
truly
love
,
I
would
willingly
submit
to
have
the
bone
of
my
arm
broken
,
or
to
let
a
bull
toss
me
,
or
to
stand
behind
a
kicking
horse
,
and
let
it
dash
its
hoof
at
my
chest
 
"
  
"
Hush
,
Jane
!
<EOS>
you
think
too
much
of
the
love
of
human
beings
;
you
are
too
impulsive
,
too
vehement
;
the
sovereign
hand
that
created
your
frame
,
and
put
life
into
it
,
has
provided
you
with
other
resources
than
your
feeble
self
,
or
than
creatures
feeble
as
you
.
<EOS>
Besides
this
earth
,
and
besides
the
race
of
men
,
there
is
an
invisible
world
and
a
kingdom
of
spirits
:
that
world
is
round
us
,
for
it
is
everywhere
;
and
those
spirits
watch
us
,
for
they
are
commissioned
to
guard
us
;
and
if
we
were
dying
in
pain
and
shame
,
if
scorn
smote
us
on
all
sides
,
and
hatred
crushed
us
,
angels
see
our
tortures
,
recognise
our
innocence
(
if
innocent
we
be
:
as
I
know
you
are
of
this
charge
which
Mr.
Brocklehurst
has
weakly
and
pompously
repeated
at
second
-
hand
from
Mrs.
Reed
;
for
I
read
a
sincere
nature
in
your
ardent
eyes
and
on
your
clear
front
)
,
and
God
waits
only
the
separation
of
spirit
from
flesh
to
crown
us
with
a
full
reward
.
<EOS>
Why
,
then
,
should
we
ever
sink
overwhelmed
with
distress
,
when
life
is
so
soon
over
,
and
death
is
so
certain
an
entrance
to
happiness
 
to
glory
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
silent
;
Helen
had
calmed
me
;
but
in
the
tranquillity
she
imparted
there
was
an
alloy
of
inexpressible
sadness
.
<EOS>
I
felt
the
impression
of
woe
as
she
spoke
,
but
I
could
not
tell
whence
it
came
;
and
when
,
having
done
speaking
,
she
breathed
a
little
fast
and
coughed
a
short
cough
<EOS>
,
I
momentarily
forgot
my
own
sorrows
to
yield
to
a
vague
concern
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
Resting
my
head
on
Helen
's
shoulder
,
I
put
my
arms
round
her
waist
;
she
drew
me
to
her
,
and
we
reposed
in
silence
.
<EOS>
We
had
not
sat
long
thus
,
when
another
person
came
in
.
<EOS>
Some
heavy
clouds
,
swept
from
the
sky
by
a
rising
wind
,
had
left
the
moon
bare
;
and
her
light
,
streaming
in
through
a
window
near
,
shone
full
both
on
us
and
on
the
approaching
figure
,
which
we
at
once
recognised
as
Miss
Temple
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
came
on
purpose
to
find
you
,
Jane
Eyre
,
"
said
she
;
"
I
want
you
in
my
room
;
and
as
Helen
Burns
is
with
you
,
she
may
come
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
went
;
following
the
superintendent
's
guidance
,
we
had
to
thread
some
intricate
passages
,
and
mount
a
staircase
before
we
reached
her
apartment
;
it
contained
a
good
fire
,
and
looked
cheerful
.
<EOS>
Miss
Temple
told
Helen
Burns
to
be
seated
in
a
low
arm
-
chair
on
one
side
of
the
hearth
,
and
herself
taking
another
,
she
called
me
to
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
all
over
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
looking
down
at
my
face
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
cried
your
grief
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
I
never
shall
do
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
have
been
wrongly
accused
;
and
you
,
ma'am
,
and
everybody
else
,
will
now
think
me
wicked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
think
you
what
you
prove
yourself
to
be
,
my
child
.
<EOS>
Continue
to
act
as
a
good
girl
,
and
you
will
satisfy
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
,
Miss
Temple
?
"
  
"
You
will
,
"
said
she
,
passing
her
arm
round
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
tell
me
who
is
the
lady
whom
Mr.
Brocklehurst
called
your
benefactress
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Reed
,
my
uncle
's
wife
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
is
dead
,
and
he
left
me
to
her
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
she
not
,
then
,
adopt
you
of
her
own
accord
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
ma'am
;
she
was
sorry
to
have
to
do
it
:
but
my
uncle
,
as
I
have
often
heard
the
servants
say
,
got
her
to
promise
before
he
died
that
she
would
always
keep
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
now
,
Jane
,
you
know
,
or
at
least
I
will
tell
you
,
that
when
a
criminal
is
accused
,
he
is
always
allowed
to
speak
in
his
own
defence
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
charged
with
falsehood
;
defend
yourself
to
me
as
well
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
Say
whatever
your
memory
suggests
is
true
;
but
add
nothing
and
exaggerate
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
resolved
,
in
the
depth
of
my
heart
,
that
I
would
be
most
moderate
 
most
correct
;
and
,
having
reflected
a
few
minutes
in
order
to
arrange
coherently
what
I
had
to
say
,
I
told
her
all
the
story
of
my
sad
childhood
.
<EOS>
Exhausted
by
emotion
,
my
language
was
more
subdued
than
it
generally
was
when
it
developed
that
sad
theme
;
and
mindful
of
Helen
's
warnings
against
the
indulgence
of
resentment
,
I
infused
into
the
narrative
far
less
of
gall
and
wormwood
than
ordinary
.
<EOS>
Thus
restrained
and
simplified
,
it
sounded
more
credible
:
I
felt
as
I
went
on
that
Miss
Temple
fully
believed
me
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
tale
I
had
mentioned
Mr.
Lloyd
as
having
come
to
see
me
after
the
fit
:
for
I
never
forgot
the
,
to
me
,
frightful
episode
of
the
red
-
room
:
<EOS>
in
detailing
which
,
my
excitement
was
sure
,
in
some
degree
,
to
break
bounds
;
for
nothing
could
soften
in
my
recollection
the
spasm
of
agony
which
clutched
my
heart
when
Mrs.
Reed
spurned
my
wild
supplication
for
pardon
,
and
locked
me
a
second
time
in
the
dark
and
haunted
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
finished
:
Miss
Temple
regarded
me
a
few
minutes
in
silence
;
she
then
said
    
"
I
know
something
of
Mr.
Lloyd
;
I
shall
write
to
him
;
if
his
reply
agrees
with
your
statement
,
you
shall
be
publicly
cleared
from
every
imputation
;
to
me
,
Jane
,
you
are
clear
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
kissed
me
,
and
still
keeping
me
at
her
side
(
where
I
was
well
contented
to
stand
,
for
I
derived
a
child
's
pleasure
from
the
contemplation
of
her
face
,
her
dress
,
her
one
or
two
ornaments
,
her
white
forehead
,
her
clustered
and
shining
curls
,
and
beaming
dark
eyes
)
,
she
proceeded
to
address
Helen
Burns
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
to
-
night
,
Helen
?
<EOS>
Have
you
coughed
much
to
-
day
?
"
  
"
Not
quite
so
much
,
I
think
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
the
pain
in
your
chest
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
little
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Temple
got
up
,
took
her
hand
and
examined
her
pulse
;
then
she
returned
to
her
own
seat
:
as
she
resumed
it
,
I
heard
her
sigh
low
.
<EOS>
She
was
pensive
a
few
minutes
,
then
rousing
herself
,
she
said
cheerfully
    
"
<EOS>
But
you
two
are
my
visitors
to
-
night
;
I
must
treat
you
as
such
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
rang
her
bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
Barbara
,
"
she
said
to
the
servant
who
answered
it
,
"
I
have
not
yet
had
tea
;
bring
the
tray
and
place
cups
for
these
two
young
ladies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
a
tray
was
soon
brought
.
<EOS>
How
pretty
,
to
my
eyes
,
did
the
china
cups
and
bright
teapot
look
,
placed
on
the
little
round
table
near
the
fire
!
<EOS>
How
fragrant
was
the
steam
of
the
beverage
,
and
the
scent
of
the
toast
!
<EOS>
of
which
,
however
,
I
,
to
my
dismay
(
for
I
was
beginning
to
be
hungry
)
discerned
only
a
very
small
portion
:
Miss
Temple
discerned
it
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
Barbara
,
"
said
she
,
"
can
you
not
bring
a
little
more
bread
and
butter
?
<EOS>
There
is
not
enough
for
three
.
"
  
<EOS>
Barbara
went
out
:
<EOS>
she
returned
soon
    
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
Mrs.
Harden
says
she
has
sent
up
the
usual
quantity
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Harden
,
be
it
observed
,
was
the
housekeeper
:
a
woman
after
Mr.
Brocklehurst
's
own
heart
,
made
up
of
equal
parts
of
whalebone
and
iron
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
very
well
!
"
returned
Miss
Temple
;
"
we
must
make
it
do
,
Barbara
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
And
as
the
girl
withdrew
she
added
,
smiling
,
"
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
I
have
it
in
my
power
to
supply
deficiencies
for
this
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Having
invited
Helen
and
me
to
approach
the
table
,
and
placed
before
each
of
us
a
cup
of
tea
with
one
delicious
but
thin
morsel
of
toast
,
she
got
up
,
unlocked
a
drawer
,
and
taking
from
it
a
parcel
wrapped
in
paper
,
disclosed
presently
to
our
eyes
a
good
-
sized
seed
-
cake
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
meant
to
give
each
of
you
some
of
this
to
take
with
you
,
"
said
she
,
"
but
as
there
is
so
little
toast
,
you
must
have
it
now
,
"
and
she
proceeded
to
cut
slices
with
a
generous
hand
.
  
<EOS>
We
feasted
that
evening
as
on
nectar
and
ambrosia
;
and
not
the
least
delight
of
the
entertainment
was
the
smile
of
gratification
with
which
our
hostess
regarded
us
,
as
we
satisfied
our
famished
appetites
on
the
delicate
fare
she
liberally
supplied
.
  
<EOS>
Tea
over
and
the
tray
removed
,
she
again
summoned
us
to
the
fire
;
we
sat
one
on
each
side
of
her
,
and
now
a
conversation
followed
between
her
and
Helen
,
which
it
was
indeed
a
privilege
to
be
admitted
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Temple
had
always
something
of
serenity
in
her
air
,
of
state
in
her
mien
,
of
refined
propriety
in
her
language
,
which
precluded
deviation
into
the
ardent
,
the
excited
,
the
eager
:
<EOS>
something
which
chastened
the
pleasure
of
those
who
looked
on
her
and
listened
to
her
,
by
a
controlling
sense
of
awe
;
and
such
was
my
feeling
now
:
<EOS>
but
as
to
Helen
Burns
,
I
was
struck
with
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
The
refreshing
meal
,
the
brilliant
fire
,
the
presence
and
kindness
of
her
beloved
instructress
,
or
,
perhaps
,
more
than
all
these
,
something
in
her
own
unique
mind
,
had
roused
her
powers
within
her
.
<EOS>
They
woke
,
they
kindled
:
<EOS>
first
,
they
glowed
in
the
bright
tint
of
her
cheek
,
which
till
this
hour
I
had
never
seen
but
pale
and
bloodless
;
then
they
shone
in
the
liquid
lustre
of
her
eyes
,
which
had
suddenly
acquired
a
beauty
more
singular
than
that
of
Miss
Temple
's
 
a
beauty
neither
of
fine
colour
nor
long
eyelash
,
nor
pencilled
brow
,
but
of
meaning
,
of
movement
,
of
radiance
.
<EOS>
Then
her
soul
sat
on
her
lips
,
and
language
flowed
,
from
what
source
I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
Has
a
girl
of
fourteen
a
heart
large
enough
,
vigorous
enough
,
to
hold
the
swelling
spring
of
pure
,
full
,
fervid
eloquence
?
<EOS>
Such
was
the
characteristic
of
Helen
's
discourse
on
that
,
to
me
,
memorable
evening
;
her
spirit
seemed
hastening
to
live
within
a
very
brief
span
as
much
as
many
live
during
a
protracted
existence
.
  
<EOS>
They
conversed
of
things
I
had
never
heard
of
;
of
nations
and
times
past
;
of
countries
far
away
;
of
secrets
of
nature
discovered
or
guessed
at
:
they
spoke
of
books
:
how
many
they
had
read
!
<EOS>
What
stores
of
knowledge
they
possessed
!
<EOS>
Then
they
seemed
so
familiar
with
French
names
and
French
authors
:
but
my
amazement
reached
its
climax
when
Miss
Temple
asked
Helen
if
she
sometimes
snatched
a
moment
to
recall
the
Latin
her
father
had
taught
her
,
and
taking
a
book
from
a
shelf
,
bade
her
read
and
construe
a
page
of
Virgil
;
and
Helen
obeyed
,
my
organ
of
veneration
expanding
at
every
sounding
line
.
<EOS>
She
had
scarcely
finished
ere
the
bell
announced
bedtime
!
<EOS>
no
delay
could
be
admitted
;
Miss
Temple
embraced
us
both
,
saying
,
as
she
drew
us
to
her
heart
    
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
my
children
!
"
  
<EOS>
Helen
she
held
a
little
longer
than
me
:
she
let
her
go
more
reluctantly
;
it
was
Helen
her
eye
followed
to
the
door
;
it
was
for
her
she
a
second
time
breathed
a
sad
sigh
;
for
her
she
wiped
a
tear
from
her
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
bedroom
,
we
heard
the
voice
of
Miss
Scatcherd
:
she
was
examining
drawers
;
she
had
just
pulled
out
Helen
Burns
's
,
and
when
we
entered
Helen
was
greeted
with
a
sharp
reprimand
,
and
told
that
to
-
morrow
she
should
have
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
untidily
folded
articles
pinned
to
her
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
things
were
indeed
in
shameful
disorder
,
"
murmured
Helen
to
me
,
in
a
low
voice
:
"
I
intended
to
have
arranged
them
,
but
I
forgot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
Miss
Scatcherd
wrote
in
conspicuous
characters
on
a
piece
of
pasteboard
the
word
"
Slattern
,
"
and
bound
it
like
a
phylactery
round
Helen
's
large
,
mild
,
intelligent
,
and
benign
-
looking
forehead
.
<EOS>
She
wore
it
till
evening
,
patient
,
unresentful
,
regarding
it
as
a
deserved
punishment
.
<EOS>
The
moment
Miss
Scatcherd
withdrew
after
afternoon
school
,
I
ran
to
Helen
,
tore
it
off
,
and
thrust
it
into
the
fire
:
the
fury
of
which
she
was
incapable
had
been
burning
in
my
soul
all
day
,
and
tears
,
hot
and
large
,
had
continually
been
scalding
my
cheek
;
for
the
spectacle
of
her
sad
resignation
gave
me
an
intolerable
pain
at
the
heart
.
  
<EOS>
About
a
week
subsequently
to
the
incidents
above
<EOS>
narrated
,
Miss
Temple
,
who
had
written
to
Mr.
Lloyd
,
received
his
answer
<EOS>
:
it
appeared
that
what
he
said
went
to
corroborate
my
account
.
<EOS>
Miss
Temple
,
having
assembled
the
whole
school
,
announced
that
inquiry
had
been
made
into
the
charges
alleged
against
Jane
Eyre
,
and
that
she
was
most
happy
to
be
able
to
pronounce
her
completely
cleared
from
every
imputation
.
<EOS>
The
teachers
then
shook
hands
with
me
and
kissed
me
,
and
a
murmur
of
pleasure
ran
through
the
ranks
of
my
companions
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
relieved
of
a
grievous
load
,
I
from
that
hour
set
to
work
afresh
,
resolved
to
pioneer
my
way
through
every
difficulty
:
I
toiled
hard
,
and
my
success
was
proportionate
to
my
efforts
;
my
memory
,
not
naturally
tenacious
,
improved
with
practice
;
exercise
sharpened
my
wits
;
in
a
few
weeks
I
was
promoted
to
a
higher
class
;
in
less
than
two
months
I
was
allowed
to
commence
French
and
drawing
.
<EOS>
I
learned
the
first
two
tenses
of
the
verb
_
Etre
_
,
and
sketched
my
first
cottage
(
whose
walls
,
by
-
the-
bye
,
outrivalled
in
slope
those
of
the
leaning
tower
of
Pisa
)
,
on
the
same
day
.
<EOS>
That
night
,
on
going
to
bed
,
I
forgot
to
prepare
in
imagination
the
Barmecide
supper
of
hot
roast
potatoes
,
or
white
bread
and
new
milk
,
with
which
I
was
wo
nt
to
amuse
my
inward
cravings
:
<EOS>
I
feasted
instead
on
the
spectacle
of
ideal
drawings
,
which
I
saw
in
the
dark
;
all
the
work
of
my
own
hands
:
freely
pencilled
houses
and
trees
,
picturesque
rocks
and
ruins
,
Cuyp
-
like
groups
of
cattle
,
sweet
paintings
of
butterflies
hovering
over
unblown
roses
,
of
birds
picking
at
ripe
cherries
,
of
wren
's
nests
enclosing
pearl
-
like
eggs
,
wreathed
about
with
young
ivy
sprays
.
<EOS>
I
examined
,
too
,
in
thought
,
the
possibility
of
my
ever
being
able
to
translate
currently
a
certain
little
French
story
which
Madame
Pierrot
had
that
day
shown
me
;
nor
was
that
problem
solved
to
my
satisfaction
ere
<EOS>
I
fell
sweetly
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
Well
has
Solomon
said
 
"
Better
is
a
dinner
of
herbs
where
love
is
,
than
a
stalled
ox
and
hatred
therewith
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
would
not
now
have
exchanged
Lowood
with
all
its
privations
for
Gateshead
and
its
daily
luxuries
.
    
<EOS>
But
the
privations
,
or
rather
the
hardships
,
of
Lowood
lessened
.
<EOS>
Spring
drew
on
:
she
was
indeed
already
come
;
the
frosts
of
winter
had
ceased
;
its
snows
were
melted
,
its
cutting
winds
ameliorated
.
<EOS>
My
wretched
feet
,
flayed
and
swollen
to
lameness
by
the
sharp
air
of
January
,
began
to
heal
and
subside
under
the
gentler
breathings
of
April
;
the
nights
and
mornings
no
longer
by
their
Canadian
temperature
froze
the
very
blood
in
our
veins
;
we
could
now
endure
the
play
-
hour
passed
in
the
garden
:
sometimes
on
a
sunny
day
it
began
even
to
be
pleasant
and
genial
,
and
a
greenness
grew
over
those
brown
beds
,
which
,
freshening
daily
,
suggested
the
thought
that
Hope
traversed
them
at
night
,
and
left
each
morning
brighter
traces
of
her
steps
.
<EOS>
Flowers
peeped
out
amongst
the
leaves
;
snow
-
drops
,
crocuses
,
purple
auriculas
,
and
golden
-
eyed
pansies
.
<EOS>
On
Thursday
afternoons
(
half
-
holidays
)
we
now
took
walks
,
and
found
still
sweeter
flowers
opening
by
the
wayside
,
under
the
hedges
.
  
<EOS>
I
discovered
,
too
,
that
a
great
pleasure
,
an
enjoyment
which
the
horizon
only
bounded
,
lay
all
outside
the
high
and
spike
-
guarded
walls
of
our
garden
:
this
pleasure
consisted
in
prospect
of
noble
summits
girdling
a
great
hill
-
hollow
,
rich
in
verdure
and
shadow
;
in
a
bright
beck
,
full
of
dark
stones
and
sparkling
eddies
.
<EOS>
How
different
had
this
scene
looked
when
I
viewed
it
laid
out
beneath
the
iron
sky
of
winter
,
stiffened
in
frost
,
shrouded
with
snow
!
 
<EOS>
when
mists
as
chill
as
death
wandered
to
the
impulse
of
east
winds
along
those
purple
peaks
,
and
rolled
down
"
ing
"
and
holm
till
they
blended
with
the
frozen
fog
of
the
beck
!
<EOS>
That
beck
itself
was
then
a
torrent
,
turbid
and
curbless
:
it
tore
asunder
the
wood
,
and
sent
a
raving
sound
through
the
air
,
often
thickened
with
wild
rain
or
whirling
sleet
;
and
for
the
forest
on
its
banks
,
_
that
_
showed
only
ranks
of
skeletons
.
  
<EOS>
April
advanced
to
May
:
a
bright
serene
<EOS>
May
it
was
;
days
of
blue
sky
,
placid
sunshine
,
and
soft
western
or
southern
gales
filled
up
its
duration
.
<EOS>
And
now
vegetation
matured
with
vigour
;
Lowood
shook
loose
its
tresses
;
it
became
all
green
,
all
flowery
;
its
great
elm
,
ash
,
and
oak
skeletons
were
restored
to
majestic
life
;
woodland
plants
sprang
up
profusely
in
its
recesses
;
unnumbered
varieties
of
moss
filled
its
hollows
,
and
it
made
a
strange
ground
-
sunshine
out
of
the
wealth
of
its
wild
primrose
plants
<EOS>
:
I
have
seen
their
pale
gold
gleam
in
overshadowed
spots
like
scatterings
of
the
sweetest
lustre
.
<EOS>
All
this
I
enjoyed
often
and
fully
,
free
,
unwatched
,
and
almost
alone
:
for
this
unwonted
liberty
and
pleasure
there
was
a
cause
,
to
which
it
now
becomes
my
task
to
advert
.
  
<EOS>
Have
I
not
described
a
pleasant
site
for
a
dwelling
,
when
I
speak
of
it
as
bosomed
in
hill
and
wood
,
and
rising
from
the
verge
of
a
stream
?
<EOS>
Assuredly
,
pleasant
enough
:
but
whether
healthy
or
not
is
another
question
.
  
<EOS>
That
forest
-
dell
,
where
Lowood
lay
,
was
the
cradle
of
fog
and
fog
-
bred
pestilence
;
which
,
quickening
with
the
quickening
spring
,
crept
into
the
Orphan
Asylum
,
breathed
typhus
through
its
crowded
schoolroom
and
dormitory
,
and
,
ere
May
arrived
,
transformed
the
seminary
into
an
hospital
.
  
<EOS>
Semi
-
starvation
and
neglected
colds
had
predisposed
most
of
the
pupils
to
receive
infection
:
forty
-
five
out
of
the
eighty
girls
lay
ill
at
one
time
.
<EOS>
Classes
were
broken
up
,
rules
relaxed
.
<EOS>
The
few
who
continued
well
were
allowed
almost
unlimited
license
;
because
the
medical
attendant
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
frequent
exercise
to
keep
them
in
health
:
and
had
it
been
otherwise
,
no
one
had
leisure
to
watch
or
restrain
them
.
<EOS>
Miss
Temple
's
whole
attention
was
absorbed
by
the
patients
:
she
lived
in
the
sick
-
room
,
never
quitting
it
except
to
snatch
a
few
hours
'
rest
at
night
.
<EOS>
The
teachers
were
fully
occupied
with
packing
up
and
making
other
necessary
preparations
for
the
departure
of
those
girls
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
have
friends
and
relations
able
and
willing
to
remove
them
from
the
seat
of
contagion
.
<EOS>
Many
,
already
smitten
,
went
home
only
to
die
:
<EOS>
some
died
at
the
school
,
and
were
buried
quietly
and
quickly
,
the
nature
of
the
malady
forbidding
delay
.
  
<EOS>
While
disease
had
thus
become
an
inhabitant
of
Lowood
,
and
death
its
frequent
visitor
;
while
there
was
gloom
and
fear
within
its
walls
;
while
its
rooms
and
passages
steamed
with
hospital
smells
,
the
drug
and
the
pastille
striving
vainly
to
overcome
the
effluvia
of
mortality
,
that
bright
May
shone
unclouded
over
the
bold
hills
and
beautiful
woodland
out
of
doors
.
<EOS>
Its
garden
,
too
,
glowed
with
flowers
:
hollyhocks
had
sprung
up
tall
as
trees
,
lilies
had
opened
,
tulips
and
roses
were
in
bloom
;
the
borders
of
the
little
beds
were
gay
with
pink
thrift
and
crimson
double
daisies
;
the
sweetbriars
gave
out
,
morning
and
evening
,
their
scent
of
spice
and
apples
;
and
these
fragrant
treasures
were
all
useless
for
most
of
the
inmates
of
Lowood
,
except
to
furnish
now
and
then
a
handful
of
herbs
and
blossoms
to
put
in
a
coffin
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
,
and
the
rest
who
continued
well
,
enjoyed
fully
the
beauties
of
the
scene
and
season
;
they
let
us
ramble
in
the
wood
,
like
gipsies
,
from
morning
till
night
;
we
did
what
we
liked
,
went
where
we
liked
:
we
lived
better
too
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Brocklehurst
and
his
family
never
came
near
Lowood
now
:
household
matters
were
not
scrutinised
into
;
the
cross
housekeeper
was
gone
,
driven
away
by
the
fear
of
infection
;
her
successor
,
who
had
been
matron
at
the
Lowton
Dispensary
,
unused
to
the
ways
of
her
new
abode
,
provided
with
comparative
liberality
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
there
were
fewer
to
feed
;
the
sick
could
eat
little
;
our
breakfast
-
basins
were
better
filled
;
when
there
was
no
time
to
prepare
a
regular
dinner
,
which
often
happened
,
she
would
give
us
a
large
piece
of
cold
pie
,
or
a
thick
slice
of
bread
and
cheese
,
and
this
we
carried
away
with
us
to
the
wood
,
where
we
each
chose
the
spot
we
liked
best
,
and
dined
sumptuously
.
  
<EOS>
My
favourite
seat
was
a
smooth
and
broad
stone
,
rising
white
and
dry
from
the
very
middle
of
the
beck
,
and
only
to
be
got
at
by
wading
through
the
water
;
a
feat
I
accomplished
barefoot
.
<EOS>
The
stone
was
just
broad
enough
to
accommodate
,
comfortably
,
another
girl
and
me
,
at
that
time
my
chosen
comrade
 
<EOS>
one
Mary
Ann
Wilson
;
a
shrewd
,
observant
personage
,
whose
society
I
took
pleasure
in
,
partly
because
she
was
witty
and
original
,
and
partly
because
she
had
a
manner
which
set
me
at
my
ease
.
<EOS>
Some
years
older
than
I
,
she
knew
more
of
the
world
,
and
could
tell
me
many
things
I
liked
to
hear
:
with
her
my
curiosity
found
gratification
:
<EOS>
to
my
faults
also
she
gave
ample
indulgence
,
never
imposing
curb
or
rein
on
anything
I
said
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
turn
for
narrative
,
I
for
analysis
;
she
liked
to
inform
,
I
to
question
;
so
we
got
on
swimmingly
together
,
deriving
much
entertainment
,
if
not
much
improvement
,
from
our
mutual
intercourse
.
  
<EOS>
And
where
,
meantime
,
was
Helen
Burns
?
<EOS>
Why
did
I
not
spend
these
sweet
days
of
liberty
with
her
?
<EOS>
Had
I
forgotten
her
?
<EOS>
or
was
I
so
worthless
as
to
have
grown
tired
of
her
pure
society
?
<EOS>
Surely
the
Mary
Ann
Wilson
I
have
mentioned
was
inferior
to
my
first
acquaintance
:
she
could
only
tell
me
amusing
stories
,
and
reciprocate
any
racy
and
pungent
gossip
<EOS>
I
chose
to
indulge
in
;
while
,
if
I
have
spoken
truth
of
Helen
,
she
was
qualified
to
give
those
who
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
her
converse
a
taste
of
far
higher
things
.
  
<EOS>
True
,
reader
;
and
I
knew
and
felt
this
:
and
though
I
am
a
defective
being
,
with
many
faults
and
few
redeeming
points
,
yet
I
never
tired
of
Helen
Burns
;
nor
ever
ceased
to
cherish
for
her
a
sentiment
of
attachment
,
as
strong
,
tender
,
and
respectful
as
any
that
ever
animated
my
heart
.
<EOS>
How
could
it
be
otherwise
,
when
Helen
,
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances
,
evinced
for
me
a
quiet
and
faithful
friendship
,
which
ill
-
humour
never
soured
,
nor
irritation
never
troubled
?
<EOS>
But
Helen
was
ill
at
present
:
for
some
weeks
she
had
been
removed
from
my
sight
to
<EOS>
I
knew
not
what
room
upstairs
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
,
I
was
told
,
in
the
hospital
portion
of
the
house
with
the
fever
patients
;
for
her
complaint
was
consumption
,
not
typhus
:
and
by
consumption
I
,
in
my
ignorance
,
understood
something
mild
,
which
time
and
care
would
be
sure
to
alleviate
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
confirmed
in
this
idea
by
the
fact
of
her
once
or
twice
coming
downstairs
on
very
warm
sunny
afternoons
,
and
being
taken
by
Miss
Temple
into
the
garden
;
but
,
on
these
occasions
,
I
was
not
allowed
to
go
and
speak
to
her
;
I
only
saw
her
from
the
schoolroom
window
,
and
then
not
distinctly
;
for
she
was
much
wrapped
up
,
and
sat
at
a
distance
under
the
verandah
.
  
<EOS>
One
evening
,
in
the
beginning
of
June
,
I
had
stayed
out
very
late
with
Mary
Ann
in
the
wood
;
we
had
,
as
usual
,
separated
ourselves
from
the
others
,
and
had
wandered
far
;
so
far
that
we
lost
our
way
,
and
had
to
ask
it
at
a
lonely
cottage
,
where
a
man
and
woman
lived
,
who
looked
after
a
herd
of
half
-
wild
swine
that
fed
on
the
mast
in
the
wood
.
<EOS>
When
we
got
back
,
it
was
after
moonrise
:
<EOS>
a
pony
,
which
we
knew
to
be
the
surgeon
's
,
was
standing
at
the
garden
door
.
<EOS>
Mary
Ann
remarked
that
she
supposed
some
one
must
be
very
ill
,
as
Mr.
Bates
had
been
sent
for
at
that
time
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
She
went
into
the
house
;
I
stayed
behind
a
few
minutes
to
plant
in
my
garden
a
handful
of
roots
I
had
dug
up
in
the
forest
,
and
<EOS>
which
I
feared
would
wither
if
I
left
them
till
the
morning
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
I
lingered
yet
a
little
longer
:
the
flowers
smelt
so
sweet
as
the
dew
fell
;
it
was
such
a
pleasant
evening
,
so
serene
,
so
warm
;
<EOS>
the
still
glowing
west
promised
so
fairly
another
fine
day
on
the
morrow
;
the
moon
rose
with
such
majesty
in
the
grave
east
.
<EOS>
I
was
noting
these
things
and
enjoying
them
as
a
child
might
,
when
it
entered
my
mind
as
it
had
never
done
before
:
    
"
How
sad
to
be
lying
now
on
a
sick
bed
,
and
to
be
in
danger
of
dying
!
<EOS>
This
world
is
pleasant
 
it
would
be
dreary
to
be
called
from
it
,
and
to
have
to
go
who
knows
where
?
"
  
<EOS>
And
then
my
mind
made
its
first
earnest
effort
to
comprehend
what
had
been
infused
into
it
concerning
heaven
and
hell
;
and
for
the
first
time
it
recoiled
,
baffled
;
and
for
the
first
time
glancing
behind
,
on
each
side
,
and
before
it
,
it
saw
all
round
an
unfathomed
gulf
:
it
felt
the
one
point
where
it
stood
 
the
present
;
all
the
rest
was
formless
cloud
and
vacant
depth
;
and
it
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
tottering
,
and
plunging
amid
that
chaos
.
<EOS>
While
pondering
this
new
idea
,
I
heard
the
front
door
open
;
Mr.
Bates
came
out
,
and
with
him
was
a
nurse
.
<EOS>
After
she
had
seen
him
mount
his
horse
and
depart
<EOS>
,
she
was
about
to
close
the
door
,
but
I
ran
up
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
Helen
Burns
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
poorly
,
"
was
the
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
her
<EOS>
Mr.
Bates
has
been
to
see
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
does
he
say
about
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
says
she
'll
not
be
here
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
phrase
,
uttered
in
my
hearing
yesterday
,
would
have
only
conveyed
the
notion
that
she
was
about
to
be
removed
to
Northumberland
,
to
her
own
home
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
suspected
that
it
meant
she
was
dying
;
but
I
knew
instantly
now
!
<EOS>
It
opened
clear
on
my
comprehension
that
Helen
Burns
was
numbering
her
last
days
in
this
world
,
and
that
she
was
going
to
be
taken
to
the
region
of
spirits
,
if
such
region
there
were
.
<EOS>
I
experienced
a
shock
of
horror
,
<EOS>
then
a
strong
thrill
of
grief
,
<EOS>
then
a
desire
 
a
necessity
to
see
her
;
and
I
asked
in
what
room
she
lay
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
in
Miss
Temple
's
room
,
"
said
the
nurse
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
go
up
and
speak
to
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
child
!
<EOS>
It
is
not
likely
;
and
now
it
is
time
for
you
to
come
in
;
you
'll
catch
the
fever
if
you
stop
out
when
the
dew
is
falling
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
nurse
closed
the
front
door
;
I
went
in
by
the
side
entrance
which
led
to
the
schoolroom
:
<EOS>
I
was
just
in
time
;
it
was
nine
o'clock
,
and
Miss
Miller
was
calling
the
pupils
to
go
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
It
might
be
two
hours
later
,
probably
near
eleven
,
when
I
 
not
having
been
able
to
fall
asleep
,
and
deeming
,
from
the
perfect
silence
of
the
dormitory
,
that
my
companions
were
all
wrapt
in
profound
repose
 
rose
softly
,
put
on
my
frock
over
my
night
-
dress
,
and
,
without
shoes
,
crept
from
the
apartment
,
and
set
off
in
quest
of
Miss
Temple
's
room
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
;
but
I
knew
my
way
;
and
the
light
of
the
unclouded
summer
moon
,
entering
here
and
there
at
passage
windows
,
enabled
me
to
find
it
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
An
odour
of
camphor
and
burnt
vinegar
warned
me
when
I
came
near
the
fever
room
:
and
I
passed
its
door
quickly
,
fearful
lest
the
nurse
who
sat
up
all
night
should
hear
me
.
<EOS>
I
dreaded
being
discovered
and
sent
back
;
for
I
_
must
_
see
Helen
,
 
<EOS>
I
must
embrace
her
before
she
died
,
 
I
must
give
her
one
last
kiss
,
exchange
with
her
one
last
word
.
  
<EOS>
Having
descended
a
staircase
,
traversed
a
portion
of
the
house
below
,
and
succeeded
in
opening
and
shutting
,
without
noise
,
two
doors
,
I
reached
another
flight
of
steps
;
these
I
mounted
,
and
then
just
opposite
to
me
was
Miss
Temple
's
room
.
<EOS>
A
light
shone
through
the
keyhole
and
from
under
the
door
;
a
profound
stillness
pervaded
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
Coming
near
,
I
found
the
door
slightly
ajar
;
probably
to
admit
some
fresh
air
into
the
close
abode
of
sickness
.
<EOS>
Indisposed
to
hesitate
,
and
full
of
impatient
impulses
 
soul
and
senses
quivering
with
keen
throes
 
<EOS>
I
put
it
back
and
looked
in
.
<EOS>
My
eye
sought
Helen
,
and
feared
to
find
death
.
  
<EOS>
Close
by
Miss
Temple
's
bed
,
and
half
covered
with
its
white
curtains
,
there
stood
a
little
crib
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
outline
of
a
form
under
the
clothes
,
but
the
face
was
hid
by
the
hangings
:
<EOS>
the
nurse
I
had
spoken
to
in
the
garden
sat
in
an
easy
-
chair
asleep
;
an
unsnuffed
candle
burnt
dimly
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
Miss
Temple
was
not
to
be
seen
:
I
knew
afterwards
that
she
had
been
called
to
a
delirious
patient
in
the
fever
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
advanced
;
then
paused
by
the
crib
side
:
<EOS>
my
hand
was
on
the
curtain
,
but
I
preferred
speaking
before
I
withdrew
it
.
<EOS>
I
still
recoiled
at
the
dread
of
seeing
a
corpse
.
  
<EOS>
"
Helen
!
<EOS>
"
I
whispered
softly
,
"
are
you
awake
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
stirred
herself
,
put
back
the
curtain
,
and
I
saw
her
face
,
pale
,
wasted
,
but
quite
composed
:
she
looked
so
little
changed
that
my
fear
was
instantly
dissipated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
it
be
you
,
Jane
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
in
her
own
gentle
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
I
thought
,
"
she
is
not
going
to
die
;
they
are
mistaken
:
she
could
not
speak
and
look
so
calmly
if
she
were
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
got
on
to
her
crib
and
kissed
her
:
<EOS>
her
forehead
was
cold
,
and
her
cheek
both
cold
and
thin
,
and
so
were
her
hand
and
wrist
;
but
she
smiled
as
of
old
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
come
here
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
It
is
past
eleven
o'clock
:
<EOS>
I
heard
it
strike
some
minutes
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
came
to
see
you
,
Helen
<EOS>
:
I
heard
you
were
very
ill
,
and
I
could
not
sleep
till
I
had
spoken
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
came
to
bid
me
good
-
bye
,
then
:
you
are
just
in
time
probably
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Are
you
going
somewhere
,
Helen
?
<EOS>
Are
you
going
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
to
my
long
home
 
my
last
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
Helen
!
"
I
stopped
,
distressed
.
<EOS>
While
I
tried
to
devour
my
tears
,
a
fit
of
coughing
seized
Helen
;
it
did
not
,
however
,
wake
the
nurse
;
when
it
was
over
,
she
lay
some
minutes
exhausted
;
then
she
whispered
    
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
your
little
feet
are
bare
;
lie
down
and
cover
yourself
with
my
quilt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
so
:
she
put
her
arm
over
me
,
and
I
nestled
close
to
her
.
<EOS>
After
a
long
silence
,
she
resumed
,
still
whispering
    
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
happy
,
Jane
;
and
when
you
hear
that
I
am
dead
,
you
must
be
sure
and
not
grieve
:
there
is
nothing
to
grieve
about
.
<EOS>
We
all
must
die
one
day
,
and
the
illness
which
is
removing
me
is
not
painful
;
it
is
gentle
and
gradual
:
<EOS>
my
mind
is
at
rest
.
<EOS>
I
leave
no
one
to
regret
me
much
:
I
have
only
a
father
;
and
he
is
lately
married
,
and
will
not
miss
me
.
<EOS>
By
dying
young
,
I
shall
escape
great
sufferings
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
qualities
or
talents
to
make
my
way
very
well
in
the
world
:
I
should
have
been
continually
at
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
where
are
you
going
to
,
Helen
?
<EOS>
Can
you
see
?
<EOS>
Do
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
;
I
have
faith
:
I
am
going
to
God
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
God
?
<EOS>
What
is
God
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
Maker
and
yours
,
who
will
never
destroy
what
He
created
.
<EOS>
I
rely
implicitly
on
His
power
,
and
confide
wholly
in
His
goodness
<EOS>
:
I
count
the
hours
till
that
eventful
one
arrives
which
shall
restore
me
to
Him
,
reveal
Him
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
sure
,
then
,
Helen
,
that
there
is
such
a
place
as
heaven
,
and
that
our
souls
can
get
to
it
when
we
die
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
there
is
a
future
state
;
I
believe
God
is
good
;
I
can
resign
my
immortal
part
to
Him
without
any
misgiving
.
<EOS>
God
is
my
father
;
God
is
my
friend
:
<EOS>
I
love
Him
;
I
believe
He
loves
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
shall
I
see
you
again
,
Helen
,
when
I
die
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
come
to
the
same
region
of
happiness
:
be
received
by
the
same
mighty
,
universal
Parent
,
no
doubt
,
dear
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Again
I
questioned
,
but
this
time
only
in
thought
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
that
region
?
<EOS>
Does
it
exist
?
"
<EOS>
And
I
clasped
my
arms
closer
round
Helen
;
she
seemed
dearer
to
me
than
ever
;
I
felt
as
if
I
could
not
let
her
go
;
I
lay
with
my
face
hidden
on
her
neck
.
<EOS>
Presently
she
said
,
in
the
sweetest
tone
    
<EOS>
"
How
comfortable
I
am
!
<EOS>
That
last
fit
of
coughing
has
tired
me
a
little
;
I
feel
as
if
I
could
sleep
:
but
do
n't
leave
me
,
Jane
;
I
like
to
have
you
near
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
stay
with
you
,
_
dear
_
Helen
:
no
one
shall
take
me
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
warm
,
darling
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
"
Good
-
night
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
Helen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
kissed
me
,
and
I
her
,
and
we
both
soon
slumbered
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
awoke
it
was
day
:
an
unusual
movement
roused
me
;
I
looked
up
;
I
was
in
somebody
's
arms
;
the
nurse
held
me
;
she
was
carrying
me
through
the
passage
back
to
the
dormitory
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
reprimanded
for
leaving
my
bed
;
people
had
something
else
to
think
about
;
no
explanation
was
afforded
then
to
my
many
questions
;
but
a
day
or
two
afterwards
I
learned
that
Miss
Temple
,
on
returning
to
her
own
room
at
dawn
,
had
found
me
laid
in
the
little
crib
;
my
face
against
Helen
Burns
's
shoulder
,
my
arms
round
her
neck
.
<EOS>
I
was
asleep
,
and
Helen
was
 
dead
.
  
<EOS>
Her
grave
is
in
Brocklebridge
churchyard
:
for
fifteen
years
after
her
death
it
was
only
covered
by
a
grassy
mound
;
but
now
a
grey
marble
tablet
marks
the
spot
,
inscribed
with
her
name
,
and
the
word
"
Resurgam
.
"
    
<EOS>
Hitherto
<EOS>
I
have
recorded
in
detail
the
events
of
my
insignificant
existence
:
to
the
first
ten
years
of
my
life
I
have
given
almost
as
many
chapters
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
not
to
be
a
regular
autobiography
.
<EOS>
I
am
only
bound
to
invoke
Memory
where
I
know
her
responses
will
possess
some
degree
of
interest
;
therefore
I
now
pass
a
space
of
eight
years
almost
in
silence
:
a
few
lines
only
are
necessary
to
keep
up
the
links
of
connection
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
typhus
fever
had
fulfilled
its
mission
of
devastation
at
Lowood
,
it
gradually
disappeared
from
thence
;
but
not
till
its
virulence
and
the
number
of
its
victims
had
drawn
public
attention
on
the
school
.
<EOS>
Inquiry
was
made
into
the
origin
of
the
scourge
,
and
by
degrees
various
facts
came
out
which
excited
public
indignation
in
a
high
degree
.
<EOS>
The
unhealthy
nature
of
the
site
;
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
children
's
food
;
the
brackish
,
fetid
water
used
in
its
preparation
;
the
pupils
'
wretched
clothing
and
accommodations
 
all
these
things
were
discovered
,
and
the
discovery
produced
a
result
mortifying
to
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
but
beneficial
to
the
institution
.
  
<EOS>
Several
wealthy
and
benevolent
individuals
in
the
county
subscribed
largely
for
the
erection
of
a
more
convenient
building
in
a
better
situation
;
new
regulations
were
made
;
improvements
in
diet
and
clothing
introduced
;
the
funds
of
the
school
were
intrusted
to
the
management
of
a
committee
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
who
,
from
his
wealth
and
family
connections
,
could
not
be
overlooked
,
still
retained
the
post
of
treasurer
;
but
he
was
aided
in
the
discharge
of
his
duties
by
gentlemen
of
rather
more
enlarged
and
sympathising
minds
:
his
office
of
inspector
,
too
,
was
shared
by
those
who
knew
how
to
combine
reason
with
strictness
,
comfort
with
economy
,
compassion
with
uprightness
.
<EOS>
The
school
,
thus
improved
,
became
in
time
a
truly
useful
and
noble
institution
.
<EOS>
I
remained
an
inmate
of
its
walls
,
after
its
regeneration
,
for
eight
years
:
six
as
pupil
,
and
two
as
teacher
;
and
in
both
capacities
I
bear
my
testimony
to
its
value
and
importance
.
  
<EOS>
During
these
eight
years
my
life
was
uniform
:
but
not
unhappy
,
because
it
was
not
inactive
.
<EOS>
I
had
the
means
of
an
excellent
education
placed
within
my
reach
;
a
fondness
for
some
of
my
studies
,
and
a
desire
to
excel
in
all
,
together
with
a
great
delight
in
pleasing
my
teachers
,
especially
such
as
I
loved
,
urged
me
on
:
I
availed
myself
fully
of
the
advantages
offered
me
.
<EOS>
In
time
I
rose
to
be
the
first
girl
of
the
first
class
;
then
I
was
invested
with
the
office
of
teacher
;
which
I
discharged
with
zeal
for
two
years
:
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
I
altered
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Temple
,
through
all
changes
,
had
thus
far
continued
superintendent
of
the
seminary
:
to
her
instruction
I
owed
the
best
part
of
my
acquirements
;
her
friendship
and
society
had
been
my
continual
solace
;
she
had
stood
me
in
the
stead
of
mother
,
governess
,
and
,
latterly
,
companion
.
<EOS>
At
this
period
she
married
,
removed
with
her
husband
(
a
clergyman
,
an
excellent
man
,
almost
worthy
of
such
a
wife
)
to
a
distant
county
,
and
consequently
was
lost
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
From
the
day
she
left
I
was
no
longer
the
same
:
with
her
was
gone
every
settled
feeling
,
every
association
that
had
made
Lowood
in
some
degree
a
home
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
imbibed
from
her
something
of
her
nature
and
much
of
her
habits
:
more
harmonious
thoughts
:
<EOS>
what
seemed
better
regulated
feelings
had
become
the
inmates
of
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
had
given
in
allegiance
to
duty
and
order
;
I
was
quiet
;
I
believed
I
was
content
:
to
the
eyes
of
others
,
usually
even
to
my
own
,
I
appeared
a
disciplined
and
subdued
character
.
  
<EOS>
But
destiny
,
in
the
shape
of
the
Rev.
Mr.
Nasmyth
,
came
between
me
and
Miss
Temple
<EOS>
:
I
saw
her
in
her
travelling
dress
step
into
a
post
-
chaise
,
shortly
after
the
marriage
ceremony
;
I
watched
the
chaise
mount
the
hill
and
disappear
beyond
its
brow
;
and
then
retired
to
my
own
room
,
and
there
spent
in
solitude
the
greatest
part
of
the
half
-
holiday
granted
in
honour
of
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
I
walked
about
the
chamber
most
of
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
imagined
myself
only
to
be
regretting
my
loss
,
and
thinking
how
to
repair
it
;
but
when
my
reflections
were
concluded
,
and
I
looked
up
and
found
that
the
afternoon
was
gone
,
and
evening
far
advanced
,
another
discovery
dawned
on
me
,
namely
,
that
in
the
interval
I
had
undergone
a
transforming
process
;
that
my
mind
had
put
off
all
it
had
borrowed
of
Miss
Temple
 
or
rather
that
she
had
taken
with
her
the
serene
atmosphere
I
had
been
breathing
in
her
vicinity
 
and
that
now
I
was
left
in
my
natural
element
,
and
beginning
to
feel
the
stirring
of
old
emotions
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
seem
as
if
a
prop
were
withdrawn
,
but
rather
as
if
a
motive
were
gone
:
it
was
not
the
power
to
be
tranquil
which
had
failed
me
,
but
the
reason
for
tranquillity
was
no
more
.
<EOS>
My
world
had
for
some
years
been
in
Lowood
:
my
experience
had
been
of
its
rules
and
systems
;
now
I
remembered
that
the
real
world
was
wide
,
and
that
a
varied
field
of
hopes
and
fears
,
of
sensations
and
excitements
,
awaited
those
who
had
courage
to
go
forth
into
its
expanse
,
to
seek
real
knowledge
of
life
amidst
its
perils
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
to
my
window
,
opened
it
,
and
looked
out
.
<EOS>
There
were
the
two
wings
of
the
building
;
there
was
the
garden
;
there
were
the
skirts
of
Lowood
;
there
was
the
hilly
horizon
.
<EOS>
My
eye
passed
all
other
objects
to
rest
on
those
most
remote
,
the
blue
peaks
;
it
was
those
I
longed
to
surmount
;
all
within
their
boundary
of
rock
and
heath
seemed
prison
-
ground
,
exile
limits
.
<EOS>
I
traced
the
white
road
winding
round
the
base
of
one
mountain
,
and
vanishing
in
a
gorge
between
two
;
how
I
longed
to
follow
it
farther
!
<EOS>
I
recalled
the
time
when
I
had
travelled
that
very
road
in
a
coach
;
I
remembered
descending
that
hill
at
twilight
;
an
age
seemed
to
have
elapsed
since
the
day
which
brought
me
first
to
Lowood
,
and
I
had
never
quitted
it
since
.
<EOS>
My
vacations
had
all
been
spent
at
school
:
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
had
never
sent
for
me
to
Gateshead
;
neither
she
nor
any
of
her
family
had
ever
been
to
visit
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
had
no
communication
by
letter
or
message
with
the
outer
world
:
school
-
rules
,
school
-
duties
,
school
-
habits
and
notions
,
and
voices
,
and
faces
,
and
phrases
,
and
costumes
,
and
preferences
,
and
antipathies
 
<EOS>
such
was
what
I
knew
of
existence
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
felt
that
it
was
not
enough
;
I
tired
of
the
routine
of
eight
years
in
one
afternoon
.
<EOS>
I
desired
liberty
;
for
liberty
I
gasped
;
for
liberty
I
uttered
a
prayer
;
it
seemed
scattered
on
the
wind
then
faintly
blowing
.
<EOS>
I
abandoned
it
and
framed
a
humbler
supplication
;
for
change
,
stimulus
:
<EOS>
that
petition
,
too
,
seemed
swept
off
into
vague
space
:
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
I
cried
,
half
desperate
,
"
grant
me
at
least
a
new
servitude
!
"
  
<EOS>
Here
a
bell
,
ringing
the
hour
of
supper
,
called
me
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
not
free
to
resume
the
interrupted
chain
of
my
reflections
till
bedtime
:
even
then
a
teacher
who
occupied
the
same
room
with
me
kept
me
from
the
subject
to
which
I
longed
to
recur
,
by
a
prolonged
effusion
of
small
talk
.
<EOS>
How
I
wished
sleep
would
silence
her
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
,
could
I
but
go
back
to
the
idea
which
had
last
entered
my
mind
as
I
stood
at
the
window
,
some
inventive
suggestion
would
rise
for
my
relief
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Gryce
snored
at
last
;
she
was
a
heavy
Welshwoman
,
and
till
now
her
habitual
nasal
strains
had
never
been
regarded
by
me
in
any
other
light
than
as
a
nuisance
;
to
-
night
I
hailed
the
first
deep
notes
with
satisfaction
;
I
was
debarrassed
of
interruption
;
my
half
-
effaced
thought
instantly
revived
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
new
servitude
!
<EOS>
There
is
something
in
that
,
"
I
soliloquised
(
mentally
,
be
it
understood
;
I
did
not
talk
aloud
)
,
"
I
know
there
is
,
because
it
does
not
sound
too
sweet
;
it
is
not
like
such
words
as
Liberty
,
Excitement
,
Enjoyment
:
<EOS>
delightful
sounds
truly
;
but
no
more
than
sounds
for
me
;
and
so
hollow
and
fleeting
that
it
is
mere
waste
of
time
to
listen
to
them
.
<EOS>
But
Servitude
!
<EOS>
That
must
be
matter
of
fact
.
<EOS>
Any
one
may
serve
:
I
have
served
here
eight
years
;
now
all
I
want
is
to
serve
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Can
I
not
get
so
much
of
my
own
will
?
<EOS>
Is
not
the
thing
feasible
?
<EOS>
Yes
 
yes
 
<EOS>
the
end
is
not
so
difficult
;
if
I
had
only
a
brain
active
enough
to
ferret
out
the
means
of
attaining
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
sat
up
in
bed
by
way
of
arousing
this
said
brain
:
it
was
a
chilly
night
;
I
covered
my
shoulders
with
a
shawl
,
and
then
I
proceeded
_
to
think
_
again
with
all
my
might
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
I
want
?
<EOS>
A
new
place
,
in
a
new
house
,
amongst
new
faces
,
under
new
circumstances
:
I
want
this
because
it
is
of
no
use
wanting
anything
better
.
<EOS>
How
do
people
do
to
get
a
new
place
?
<EOS>
They
apply
to
friends
,
I
suppose
:
I
have
no
friends
.
<EOS>
There
are
many
others
who
have
no
friends
,
who
must
look
about
for
themselves
and
be
their
own
helpers
;
and
what
is
their
resource
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
:
nothing
answered
me
;
I
then
ordered
my
brain
to
find
a
response
,
and
quickly
.
<EOS>
It
worked
and
worked
faster
:
I
felt
the
pulses
throb
in
my
head
and
temples
;
but
for
nearly
an
hour
it
worked
in
chaos
;
and
no
result
came
of
its
efforts
.
<EOS>
Feverish
with
vain
labour
,
I
got
up
and
took
a
turn
in
the
room
;
undrew
the
curtain
,
noted
a
star
or
two
,
shivered
with
cold
,
and
again
crept
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
A
kind
fairy
,
in
my
absence
,
had
surely
dropped
the
required
suggestion
on
my
pillow
;
for
as
I
lay
down
,
it
came
quietly
and
naturally
to
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
"
Those
who
want
situations
advertise
;
you
must
advertise
in
the
_
 
shire
Herald
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
?
I
know
nothing
about
advertising
.
"
  
<EOS>
Replies
rose
smooth
and
prompt
now
:
    
<EOS>
"
You
must
enclose
the
advertisement
and
the
money
to
pay
for
it
under
a
cover
directed
to
the
editor
of
the
_
Herald
_
;
you
must
put
it
,
the
first
opportunity
you
have
,
into
the
post
at
Lowton
;
answers
must
be
addressed
to
J.E.
,
at
the
post
-
office
there
;
you
can
go
and
inquire
in
about
a
week
after
you
send
your
letter
,
if
any
are
come
,
and
act
accordingly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
scheme
I
went
over
twice
,
thrice
<EOS>
;
it
was
then
digested
in
my
mind
;
I
had
it
in
a
clear
practical
form
:
<EOS>
I
felt
satisfied
,
and
fell
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
With
earliest
day
,
I
was
up
:
<EOS>
I
had
my
advertisement
written
,
enclosed
,
and
directed
before
the
bell
rang
to
rouse
the
school
;
it
ran
thus
:
    
"
A
young
lady
accustomed
to
tuition
"
<EOS>
(
had
I
not
been
a
teacher
two
years
?
)
<EOS>
"
is
desirous
of
meeting
with
a
situation
in
a
private
family
where
the
children
are
under
fourteen
"
(
I
thought
that
as
I
was
barely
eighteen
,
it
would
not
do
to
undertake
the
guidance
of
pupils
nearer
my
own
age
)
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
qualified
to
teach
the
usual
branches
of
a
good
English
education
,
together
with
French
,
Drawing
,
and
Music
"
(
in
those
days
,
reader
,
this
now
narrow
catalogue
of
accomplishments
,
would
have
been
held
tolerably
comprehensive
)
.
<EOS>
"
Address

J.E.
,

-

,
Lowton
,
 
shire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
document
remained
locked
in
my
drawer
all
day
:
after
tea
,
I
asked
leave
of
the
new
superintendent
to
go
to
Lowton
,
in
order
to
perform
some
small
commissions
for
myself
and
one
or
two
of
my
fellow
-
teachers
;
permission
was
readily
granted
;
I
went
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
walk
of
two
miles
,
and
the
evening
was
wet
,
but
the
days
were
still
long
;
I
visited
a
shop
or
two
,
slipped
the
letter
into
the
post
-
office
,
and
came
back
through
heavy
rain
,
with
streaming
garments
,
but
with
a
relieved
heart
.
  
<EOS>
The
succeeding
week
seemed
long
:
it
came
to
an
end
at
last
,
however
,
like
all
sublunary
things
,
and
once
more
,
towards
the
close
of
a
pleasant
autumn
day
,
I
found
myself
afoot
on
the
road
to
Lowton
.
<EOS>
A
picturesque
track
it
was
,
by
the
way
;
lying
along
the
side
of
the
beck
and
through
the
sweetest
curves
of
the
dale
:
but
that
day
I
thought
more
of
the
letters
,
that
might
or
might
not
be
awaiting
me
at
the
little
burgh
whither
I
was
bound
,
than
of
the
charms
of
lea
and
water
.
  
<EOS>
My
ostensible
errand
on
this
occasion
was
to
get
measured
for
a
pair
of
shoes
;
so
I
discharged
that
business
first
,
and
when
it
was
done
,
I
stepped
across
the
clean
and
quiet
little
street
from
the
shoemaker
's
to
the
post
-
office
:
it
was
kept
by
an
old
dame
,
who
wore
horn
spectacles
on
her
nose
,
and
black
mittens
on
her
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
there
any
letters
for
J.E.
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
She
peered
at
me
over
her
spectacles
,
and
then
she
opened
a
drawer
and
fumbled
among
its
contents
for
a
long
time
,
so
long
that
my
hopes
began
to
falter
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
having
held
a
document
before
her
glasses
for
nearly
five
minutes
,
she
presented
it
across
the
counter
,
accompanying
the
act
by
another
inquisitive
and
mistrustful
glance
 
<EOS>
it
was
for
J.E.
  
"
<EOS>
Is
there
only
one
?
<EOS>
"
I
demanded
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
no
more
,
"
said
she
;
and
I
put
it
in
my
pocket
and
turned
my
face
homeward
:
I
could
not
open
it
then
;
rules
obliged
me
to
be
back
by
eight
,
and
it
was
already
half
-
past
seven
.
  
<EOS>
Various
duties
awaited
me
on
my
arrival
.
<EOS>
I
had
to
sit
with
the
girls
during
their
hour
of
study
;
then
it
was
my
turn
to
read
prayers
;
to
see
them
to
bed
:
afterwards
I
supped
with
the
other
teachers
.
<EOS>
Even
when
we
finally
retired
for
the
night
,
the
inevitable
Miss
Gryce
was
still
my
companion
:
we
had
only
a
short
end
of
candle
in
our
candlestick
,
and
I
dreaded
lest
she
should
talk
till
it
was
all
burnt
out
;
fortunately
,
however
,
the
heavy
supper
she
had
eaten
produced
a
soporific
effect
:
she
was
already
snoring
before
I
had
finished
undressing
.
<EOS>
There
still
remained
an
inch
of
candle
:
I
now
took
out
my
letter
;
the
seal
was
an
initial
F.
;
I
broke
it
;
the
contents
were
brief
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
J.E.
,
who
advertised
in
the
_
 
shire
Herald
_
of
last
Thursday
,
possesses
the
acquirements
mentioned
,
and
if
she
is
in
a
position
to
give
satisfactory
references
as
to
character
and
competency
,
a
situation
can
be
offered
her
where
there
is
but
one
pupil
,
a
little
girl
,
under
ten
years
of
age
;
and
where
the
salary
is
thirty
pounds
per
annum
.
<EOS>
J.E.
is
requested
to
send
references
,
name
,
address
,
and
all
particulars
to
the
direction
:
    
"
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
Thornfield
,
near
Millcote
,
shire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
examined
the
document
long
:
the
writing
was
old
-
fashioned
and
rather
uncertain
,
like
that
of
an
elderly
lady
.
<EOS>
This
circumstance
was
satisfactory
:
a
private
fear
had
haunted
me
,
that
in
thus
acting
for
myself
,
and
by
my
own
guidance
,
I
ran
the
risk
of
getting
into
some
scrape
;
and
,
above
all
things
,
I
wished
the
result
of
my
endeavours
to
be
respectable
,
proper
,
_
en
regle
_
.
<EOS>
I
now
felt
that
an
elderly
lady
was
no
bad
ingredient
in
the
business
I
had
on
hand
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
!
<EOS>
I
saw
her
in
a
black
gown
and
widow
's
cap
;
frigid
,
perhaps
,
but
not
uncivil
:
a
model
of
elderly
English
respectability
.
<EOS>
Thornfield
!
<EOS>
that
,
doubtless
,
was
the
name
of
her
house
:
a
neat
orderly
spot
,
I
was
sure
;
though
I
failed
in
my
efforts
to
conceive
a
correct
plan
of
the
premises
.
<EOS>
Millcote
,
shire
;
I
brushed
up
my
recollections
of
the
map
of
England
,
<EOS>
yes
,
I
saw
it
;
both
the
shire
and
the
town
.
<EOS>
shire
was
seventy
miles
nearer
London
than
the
remote
county
where
I
now
resided
:
that
was
a
recommendation
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
longed
to
go
where
there
was
life
and
movement
:
Millcote
was
a
large
manufacturing
town
on
the
banks
of
the
A-
;
a
busy
place
enough
,
doubtless
:
so
much
the
better
;
it
would
be
a
complete
change
at
least
.
<EOS>
Not
that
my
fancy
was
much
captivated
by
the
idea
of
long
chimneys
and
clouds
of
smoke
 
"
but
,
"
I
argued
,
"
Thornfield
will
,
probably
,
be
a
good
way
from
the
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
the
socket
of
the
candle
dropped
,
and
the
wick
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
Next
day
new
steps
were
to
be
taken
;
my
plans
could
no
longer
be
confined
to
my
own
breast
;
I
must
impart
them
in
order
to
achieve
their
success
.
<EOS>
Having
sought
and
obtained
an
audience
of
the
superintendent
during
the
noontide
recreation
,
I
told
her
I
had
a
prospect
of
getting
a
new
situation
where
the
salary
would
be
double
what
I
now
received
(
for
at
Lowood
I
only
got
15
pounds
per
annum
)
;
and
requested
she
would
break
the
matter
for
me
to
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
or
some
of
the
committee
,
and
ascertain
whether
they
would
permit
me
to
mention
them
as
references
.
<EOS>
She
obligingly
consented
to
act
as
mediatrix
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
she
laid
the
affair
before
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
who
said
that
Mrs.
Reed
must
be
written
to
,
as
she
was
my
natural
guardian
.
<EOS>
A
note
was
accordingly
addressed
to
that
lady
,
who
returned
for
answer
,
that
"
I
might
do
as
I
pleased
:
she
had
long
relinquished
all
interference
in
my
affairs
.
"
<EOS>
This
note
went
the
round
of
the
committee
,
and
at
last
,
after
what
appeared
to
me
most
tedious
delay
,
formal
leave
was
given
me
to
better
my
condition
if
I
could
;
and
an
assurance
added
,
that
as
I
had
always
conducted
myself
well
,
both
as
teacher
and
pupil
,
at
Lowood
,
a
testimonial
of
character
and
capacity
,
signed
by
the
inspectors
of
that
institution
,
should
forthwith
be
furnished
me
.
  
<EOS>
This
testimonial
I
accordingly
received
in
about
a
month
,
forwarded
a
copy
of
it
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
and
got
that
lady
's
reply
,
stating
that
she
was
satisfied
,
and
fixing
that
day
fortnight
as
the
period
for
my
assuming
the
post
of
governess
in
her
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
busied
myself
in
preparations
:
the
fortnight
passed
rapidly
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
a
very
large
wardrobe
,
though
it
was
adequate
to
my
wants
;
and
the
last
day
sufficed
to
pack
my
trunk
,
 
the
same
I
had
brought
with
me
eight
years
ago
from
Gateshead
.
  
<EOS>
The
box
was
corded
,
the
card
nailed
on
.
<EOS>
In
half
-
an
-
hour
the
carrier
was
to
call
for
it
to
take
it
to
Lowton
,
whither
I
myself
was
to
repair
at
an
early
hour
the
next
morning
to
meet
the
coach
.
<EOS>
I
had
brushed
my
black
stuff
travelling
-
dress
,
prepared
my
bonnet
,
gloves
,
and
muff
;
sought
in
all
my
drawers
to
see
that
no
article
was
left
behind
;
and
now
having
nothing
more
to
do
,
I
sat
down
and
tried
to
rest
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
;
though
I
had
been
on
foot
all
day
,
I
could
not
now
repose
an
instant
;
I
was
too
much
excited
.
<EOS>
A
phase
of
my
life
was
closing
to
-
night
,
a
new
one
opening
to
-
morrow
:
impossible
to
slumber
in
the
interval
;
I
must
watch
feverishly
while
the
change
was
being
accomplished
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
,
"
said
a
servant
who
met
me
in
the
lobby
,
where
I
was
wandering
like
a
troubled
spirit
,
"
a
person
below
wishes
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
carrier
,
no
doubt
,
"
I
thought
,
and
ran
downstairs
without
inquiry
.
<EOS>
I
was
passing
the
back
-
parlour
or
teachers
'
sitting
-
room
,
the
door
of
which
was
half
open
,
to
go
to
the
kitchen
,
when
some
one
ran
out
    
<EOS>
"
It
's
her
,
I
am
sure
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
told
her
anywhere
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
individual
who
stopped
my
progress
and
took
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
:
<EOS>
I
saw
a
woman
attired
like
a
well
-
dressed
servant
,
matronly
,
yet
still
young
;
very
good
-
looking
,
with
black
hair
and
eyes
,
and
lively
complexion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
who
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
in
a
voice
and
with
a
smile
I
half
recognised
;
"
you
've
not
quite
forgotten
me
,
I
think
,
Miss
Jane
?
"
  
<EOS>
In
another
second
I
was
embracing
and
kissing
her
rapturously
:
"
Bessie
!
<EOS>
Bessie
!
<EOS>
Bessie
!
<EOS>
"
that
was
all
I
said
;
whereat
she
half
laughed
,
half
cried
,
and
we
both
went
into
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
By
the
fire
stood
a
little
fellow
of
three
years
old
,
in
plaid
frock
and
trousers
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
my
little
boy
,
"
said
Bessie
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
married
,
Bessie
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
nearly
five
years
since
to
Robert
Leaven
,
the
coachman
;
and
I
've
a
little
girl
besides
Bobby
there
,
that
I
've
christened
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
do
n't
live
at
Gateshead
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
live
at
the
lodge
:
the
old
porter
has
left
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
how
do
they
all
get
on
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
everything
about
them
,
Bessie
:
but
sit
down
first
;
and
,
Bobby
,
come
and
sit
on
my
knee
,
will
you
?
"
<EOS>
but
Bobby
preferred
sidling
over
to
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
grown
so
very
tall
,
Miss
Jane
,
nor
so
very
stout
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Leaven
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
they
've
not
kept
you
too
well
at
school
:
Miss
Reed
is
the
head
and
shoulders
taller
than
you
are
;
and
Miss
Georgiana
would
make
two
of
you
in
breadth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Georgiana
is
handsome
,
I
suppose
,
Bessie
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
.
<EOS>
She
went
up
to
London
last
winter
with
her
mama
,
and
there
everybody
admired
her
,
and
a
young
lord
fell
in
love
with
her
:
but
his
relations
were
against
the
match
;
and
 
what
do
you
think
?
 
<EOS>
he
and
Miss
Georgiana
made
it
up
to
run
away
;
but
they
were
found
out
and
stopped
.
<EOS>
It
was
Miss
Reed
that
found
them
out
:
<EOS>
I
believe
she
was
envious
;
and
now
she
and
her
sister
lead
a
cat
and
dog
life
together
;
they
are
always
quarrelling
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
what
of
John
Reed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
is
not
doing
so
well
as
his
mama
could
wish
.
<EOS>
He
went
to
college
,
and
he
got
 
plucked
<EOS>
,
I
think
they
call
it
:
and
then
his
uncles
wanted
him
to
be
a
barrister
,
and
study
the
law
:
but
he
is
such
a
dissipated
young
man
<EOS>
,
they
will
never
make
much
of
him
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
he
look
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
very
tall
:
some
people
call
him
a
fine
-
looking
young
man
;
but
he
has
such
thick
lips
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Reed
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Missis
looks
stout
and
well
enough
in
the
face
,
but
I
think
she
's
not
quite
easy
in
her
mind
:
<EOS>
Mr.
John
's
conduct
does
not
please
her
 
<EOS>
he
spends
a
deal
of
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
she
send
you
here
,
Bessie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
:
but
I
have
long
wanted
to
see
you
,
and
when
I
heard
that
there
had
been
a
letter
from
you
,
and
that
you
were
going
to
another
part
of
the
country
<EOS>
,
I
thought
I
'd
just
set
off
,
and
get
a
look
at
you
before
you
were
quite
out
of
my
reach
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
you
are
disappointed
in
me
,
Bessie
.
<EOS>
"
I
said
this
laughing
:
<EOS>
I
perceived
that
Bessie
's
glance
,
though
it
expressed
regard
,
did
in
no
shape
denote
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Miss
Jane
,
not
exactly
:
you
are
genteel
enough
;
you
look
like
a
lady
,
and
it
is
as
much
as
ever
<EOS>
I
expected
of
you
:
you
were
no
beauty
as
a
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
smiled
at
Bessie
's
frank
answer
<EOS>
:
I
felt
that
it
was
correct
,
but
I
confess
I
was
not
quite
indifferent
to
its
import
:
<EOS>
at
eighteen
most
people
wish
to
please
,
and
the
conviction
that
they
have
not
an
exterior
likely
to
second
that
desire
brings
anything
but
gratification
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
are
clever
,
though
,
"
continued
Bessie
,
by
way
of
solace
.
<EOS>
"
What
can
you
do
?
<EOS>
Can
you
play
on
the
piano
?
"
  
"
A
little
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
one
in
the
room
;
Bessie
went
and
opened
it
,
and
then
asked
me
to
sit
down
and
give
her
a
tune
:
I
played
a
waltz
or
two
,
and
she
was
charmed
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Miss
Reeds
could
not
play
as
well
!
"
said
she
exultingly
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
said
you
would
surpass
them
in
learning
:
and
can
you
draw
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
one
of
my
paintings
over
the
chimney
-
piece
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
landscape
in
water
colours
,
of
which
I
had
made
a
present
to
the
superintendent
,
in
acknowledgment
of
her
obliging
mediation
with
the
committee
on
my
behalf
,
and
which
she
had
framed
and
glazed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
that
is
beautiful
,
Miss
Jane
!
<EOS>
It
is
as
fine
a
picture
as
any
Miss
Reed
's
drawing
-
master
could
paint
,
let
alone
the
young
ladies
themselves
,
who
could
not
come
near
it
:
and
have
you
learnt
French
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Bessie
,
I
can
both
read
it
and
speak
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
can
work
on
muslin
and
canvas
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
are
quite
a
lady
,
Miss
Jane
!
<EOS>
I
knew
you
would
be
:
you
will
get
on
whether
your
relations
notice
you
or
not
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
I
wanted
to
ask
you
.
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
heard
anything
from
your
father
's
kinsfolk
,
the
Eyres
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
know
Missis
always
said
they
were
poor
and
quite
despicable
:
and
they
may
be
poor
;
but
I
believe
they
are
as
much
gentry
as
the
Reeds
are
;
for
one
day
,
nearly
seven
years
ago
,
a
Mr.
Eyre
came
to
Gateshead
and
wanted
to
see
you
;
Missis
said
you
were
at
school
fifty
miles
off
;
he
seemed
so
much
disappointed
,
for
he
could
not
stay
:
he
was
going
on
a
voyage
to
a
foreign
country
,
and
the
ship
was
to
sail
from
London
in
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
He
looked
quite
a
gentleman
,
and
I
believe
he
was
your
father
's
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
foreign
country
was
he
going
to
,
Bessie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
An
island
thousands
of
miles
off
,
where
they
make
wine
 
<EOS>
the
butler
did
tell
me
 
"
  
"
Madeira
?
"
<EOS>
I
suggested
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
that
is
it
 
<EOS>
that
is
the
very
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
he
went
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
he
did
not
stay
many
minutes
in
the
house
:
Missis
was
very
high
with
him
;
she
called
him
afterwards
a
"
sneaking
tradesman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
Robert
believes
he
was
a
wine
-
merchant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
,
"
I
returned
;
"
or
perhaps
clerk
or
agent
to
a
wine
-
merchant
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bessie
and
I
conversed
about
old
times
an
hour
longer
,
and
then
she
was
obliged
to
leave
me
<EOS>
:
I
saw
her
again
for
a
few
minutes
the
next
morning
at
Lowton
,
while
I
was
waiting
for
the
coach
.
<EOS>
We
parted
finally
at
the
door
of
the
Brocklehurst
Arms
there
:
each
went
her
separate
way
;
she
set
off
for
the
brow
of
Lowood
Fell
to
meet
the
conveyance
which
was
to
take
her
back
to
Gateshead
<EOS>
,
I
mounted
the
vehicle
which
was
to
bear
me
to
new
duties
and
a
new
life
in
the
unknown
environs
of
Millcote
.
    
<EOS>
A
new
chapter
in
a
novel
is
something
like
a
new
scene
in
a
play
;
and
when
I
draw
up
the
curtain
this
time
,
reader
,
you
must
fancy
<EOS>
you
see
a
room
in
the
George
Inn
at
Millcote
,
with
such
large
figured
papering
on
the
walls
as
inn
rooms
have
;
such
a
carpet
,
such
furniture
,
such
ornaments
on
the
mantelpiece
,
such
prints
,
including
a
portrait
of
George
the
Third
,
and
another
of
the
Prince
of
Wales
,
and
a
representation
of
the
death
of
Wolfe
.
<EOS>
All
this
is
visible
to
you
by
the
light
of
an
oil
lamp
hanging
from
the
ceiling
,
and
by
that
of
an
excellent
fire
,
near
which
I
sit
in
my
cloak
and
bonnet
;
my
muff
and
umbrella
lie
on
the
table
,
and
I
am
warming
away
the
numbness
and
chill
contracted
by
sixteen
hours
'
exposure
to
the
rawness
of
an
October
day
:
I
left
Lowton
at
four
o'clock
a.m.
,
and
the
Millcote
town
clock
is
now
just
striking
eight
.
  
<EOS>
Reader
,
though
I
look
comfortably
accommodated
,
I
am
not
very
tranquil
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
thought
when
the
coach
stopped
here
there
would
be
some
one
to
meet
me
;
I
looked
anxiously
round
as
I
descended
the
wooden
steps
the
"
boots
"
placed
for
my
convenience
,
expecting
to
hear
my
name
pronounced
,
and
to
see
some
description
of
carriage
waiting
to
convey
me
to
Thornfield
.
<EOS>
Nothing
of
the
sort
was
visible
;
and
when
I
asked
a
waiter
if
any
one
had
been
to
inquire
after
a
Miss
Eyre
,
I
was
answered
in
the
negative
:
<EOS>
so
I
had
no
resource
but
<EOS>
to
request
to
be
shown
into
a
private
room
:
<EOS>
and
here
I
am
waiting
,
while
all
sorts
of
doubts
and
fears
are
troubling
my
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
very
strange
sensation
to
inexperienced
youth
to
feel
itself
quite
alone
in
the
world
,
cut
adrift
from
every
connection
,
uncertain
whether
the
port
to
which
it
is
bound
can
be
reached
,
and
prevented
by
many
impediments
from
returning
to
that
it
has
quitted
.
<EOS>
The
charm
of
adventure
sweetens
that
sensation
,
the
glow
of
pride
warms
it
;
but
then
the
throb
of
fear
disturbs
it
;
and
fear
with
me
became
predominant
when
half
-
an
-
hour
elapsed
and
still
I
was
alone
.
<EOS>
I
bethought
myself
to
ring
the
bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
a
place
in
this
neighbourhood
called
Thornfield
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
of
the
waiter
who
answered
the
summons
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thornfield
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
,
ma'am
;
I
'll
inquire
at
the
bar
.
"
<EOS>
He
vanished
,
but
reappeared
instantly
    
<EOS>
"
Is
your
name
Eyre
,
Miss
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Person
here
waiting
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
jumped
up
,
took
my
muff
and
umbrella
,
and
hastened
into
the
inn
-
passage
:
a
man
was
standing
by
the
open
door
,
and
in
the
lamp
-
lit
street
I
dimly
saw
a
one
-
horse
conveyance
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
will
be
your
luggage
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
the
man
rather
abruptly
when
he
saw
me
,
pointing
to
my
trunk
in
the
passage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
<EOS>
He
hoisted
it
on
to
the
vehicle
,
which
was
a
sort
of
car
,
and
then
I
got
in
;
before
he
shut
me
up
,
I
asked
him
how
far
it
was
to
Thornfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
matter
of
six
miles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
shall
we
be
before
we
get
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Happen
an
hour
and
a
half
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
fastened
the
car
door
,
climbed
to
his
own
seat
outside
,
and
we
set
off
.
<EOS>
Our
progress
was
leisurely
,
and
gave
me
ample
time
to
reflect
;
I
was
content
to
be
at
length
so
near
the
end
of
my
journey
;
and
as
I
leaned
back
in
the
comfortable
though
not
elegant
conveyance
,
I
meditated
much
at
my
ease
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
thought
I
,
"
judging
from
the
plainness
of
the
servant
and
carriage
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
is
not
a
very
dashing
person
:
so
much
the
better
;
I
never
lived
amongst
fine
people
but
once
,
and
I
was
very
miserable
with
them
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
she
lives
alone
except
this
little
girl
;
if
so
,
and
if
she
is
in
any
degree
amiable
,
I
shall
surely
be
able
to
get
on
with
her
;
I
will
do
my
best
;
it
is
a
pity
that
doing
one
's
best
does
not
always
answer
.
<EOS>
At
Lowood
,
indeed
,
I
took
that
resolution
,
kept
it
,
and
succeeded
in
pleasing
;
but
with
Mrs.
Reed
,
I
remember
my
best
was
always
spurned
with
scorn
.
<EOS>
I
pray
God
Mrs.
Fairfax
may
not
turn
out
a
second
Mrs.
Reed
;
but
if
she
does
,
I
am
not
bound
to
stay
with
her
!
<EOS>
let
the
worst
come
to
the
worst
,
I
can
advertise
again
.
<EOS>
How
far
are
we
on
our
road
now
,
I
wonder
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
let
down
the
window
and
looked
out
;
Millcote
was
behind
us
;
judging
by
the
number
of
its
lights
,
it
seemed
a
place
of
considerable
magnitude
,
much
larger
than
Lowton
.
<EOS>
We
were
now
,
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
on
a
sort
of
common
;
but
there
were
houses
scattered
all
over
the
district
<EOS>
;
I
felt
we
were
in
a
different
region
to
Lowood
,
more
populous
,
less
picturesque
;
more
stirring
,
less
romantic
.
  
<EOS>
The
roads
were
heavy
,
the
night
misty
;
my
conductor
let
his
horse
walk
all
the
way
,
and
the
hour
and
a
half
extended
,
I
verily
believe
,
to
two
hours
;
at
last
he
turned
in
his
seat
and
said
    
"
You
're
noan
so
far
fro
'
Thornfield
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Again
I
looked
out
:
we
were
passing
a
church
;
I
saw
its
low
broad
tower
against
the
sky
,
and
its
bell
was
tolling
a
quarter
;
I
saw
a
narrow
galaxy
of
lights
too
,
on
a
hillside
,
marking
a
village
or
hamlet
.
<EOS>
About
ten
minutes
after
,
the
driver
got
down
and
opened
a
pair
of
gates
:
we
passed
through
,
and
they
clashed
to
behind
us
.
<EOS>
We
now
slowly
ascended
a
drive
,
and
came
upon
the
long
front
of
a
house
:
<EOS>
candlelight
gleamed
from
one
curtained
bow
-
window
;
all
the
rest
were
dark
.
<EOS>
The
car
stopped
at
the
front
door
;
it
was
opened
by
a
maid
-
servant
;
I
alighted
and
went
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
walk
this
way
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
girl
;
and
I
followed
her
across
a
square
hall
with
high
doors
all
round
:
she
ushered
me
into
a
room
whose
double
illumination
of
fire
and
candle
at
first
dazzled
me
,
contrasting
as
it
did
with
the
darkness
to
which
my
eyes
had
been
for
two
hours
inured
;
when
I
could
see
,
however
,
a
cosy
and
agreeable
picture
presented
itself
to
my
view
.
  
<EOS>
A
snug
small
room
;
a
round
table
by
a
cheerful
fire
;
an
arm
-
chair
high-
backed
and
old
-
fashioned
,
wherein
sat
the
neatest
imaginable
little
elderly
lady
,
in
widow
's
cap
,
black
silk
gown
,
and
snowy
muslin
apron
;
exactly
like
what
I
had
fancied
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
only
less
stately
and
milder
looking
.
<EOS>
She
was
occupied
in
knitting
;
a
large
cat
sat
demurely
at
her
feet
;
nothing
in
short
was
wanting
to
complete
the
beau
-
ideal
of
domestic
comfort
.
<EOS>
A
more
reassuring
introduction
for
a
new
governess
could
scarcely
be
conceived
;
there
was
no
grandeur
to
overwhelm
,
no
stateliness
to
embarrass
;
and
then
,
as
I
entered
,
the
old
lady
got
up
and
promptly
and
kindly
came
forward
to
meet
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
you
have
had
a
tedious
ride
;
John
drives
so
slowly
;
you
must
be
cold
,
come
to
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
I.
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
you
are
right
:
do
sit
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
conducted
me
to
her
own
chair
,
and
then
began
to
remove
my
shawl
and
untie
my
bonnet
-
strings
;
I
begged
she
would
not
give
herself
so
much
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
is
no
trouble
;
I
dare
say
your
own
hands
are
almost
numbed
with
cold
.
<EOS>
Leah
,
make
a
little
hot
negus
and
cut
a
sandwich
or
two
:
here
are
the
keys
of
the
storeroom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
she
produced
from
her
pocket
a
most
housewifely
bunch
of
keys
,
and
delivered
them
to
the
servant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
then
,
draw
nearer
to
the
fire
,
"
she
continued
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
brought
your
luggage
with
you
,
have
n't
you
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
.
"
  
"
I
'll
see
it
carried
into
your
room
,
"
she
said
,
and
bustled
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
treats
me
like
a
visitor
,
"
thought
I.
"
<EOS>
I
little
expected
such
a
reception
;
I
anticipated
only
coldness
and
stiffness
:
this
is
not
like
what
I
have
heard
of
the
treatment
of
governesses
;
but
I
must
not
exult
too
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
returned
;
with
her
own
hands
cleared
her
knitting
apparatus
and
a
book
or
two
from
the
table
,
to
make
room
for
the
tray
which
Leah
now
brought
,
and
then
herself
handed
me
the
refreshments
.
<EOS>
I
felt
rather
confused
at
being
the
object
of
more
attention
than
I
had
ever
before
received
,
and
,
that
too
,
shown
by
my
employer
and
superior
;
but
as
she
did
not
herself
seem
to
consider
she
was
doing
anything
out
of
her
place
,
I
thought
it
better
to
take
her
civilities
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
Miss
Fairfax
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
when
I
had
partaken
of
what
she
offered
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
say
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
I
am
a
little
deaf
,
"
returned
the
good
lady
,
approaching
her
ear
to
my
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
I
repeated
the
question
more
distinctly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Fairfax
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
mean
Miss
Varens
<EOS>
!
<EOS>
Varens
is
the
name
of
your
future
pupil
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
Then
she
is
not
your
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
 
I
have
no
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
followed
up
my
first
inquiry
,
by
asking
in
what
way
Miss
Varens
was
connected
with
her
;
but
I
recollected
it
was
not
polite
to
ask
too
many
questions
:
besides
,
I
was
sure
to
hear
in
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
,
"
she
continued
,
as
she
sat
down
opposite
to
me
,
and
took
the
cat
on
her
knee
;
"
I
am
so
glad
you
are
come
;
it
will
be
quite
pleasant
living
here
now
with
a
companion
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
it
is
pleasant
at
any
time
;
for
Thornfield
is
a
fine
old
hall
,
rather
neglected
of
late
years
perhaps
,
but
still
it
is
a
respectable
place
;
yet
you
know
in
winter
-
time
one
feels
dreary
quite
alone
in
the
best
quarters
.
<EOS>
I
say
alone
 
<EOS>
Leah
is
a
nice
girl
to
be
sure
,
and
John
and
his
wife
are
very
decent
people
;
but
then
you
see
they
are
only
servants
,
and
one
ca
n't
converse
with
them
on
terms
of
equality
:
one
must
keep
them
at
due
distance
,
for
fear
of
losing
one
's
authority
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
last
winter
(
it
was
a
very
severe
one
,
if
you
recollect
,
and
when
it
did
not
snow
,
it
rained
and
blew
)
,
<EOS>
not
a
creature
but
the
butcher
and
postman
came
to
the
house
,
from
November
till
February
;
and
I
really
got
quite
melancholy
with
sitting
night
after
night
alone
<EOS>
;
I
had
Leah
in
to
read
to
me
sometimes
;
but
I
do
n't
think
the
poor
girl
liked
the
task
much
:
she
felt
it
confining
.
<EOS>
In
spring
and
summer
one
got
on
better
:
<EOS>
sunshine
and
long
days
make
such
a
difference
;
and
then
,
just
at
the
commencement
of
this
autumn
,
little
Adela
Varens
came
and
her
nurse
<EOS>
:
a
child
makes
a
house
alive
all
at
once
;
and
now
you
are
here
<EOS>
I
shall
be
quite
gay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
heart
really
warmed
to
the
worthy
lady
as
I
heard
her
talk
;
and
I
drew
my
chair
a
little
nearer
to
her
,
and
expressed
my
sincere
wish
that
she
might
find
my
company
as
agreeable
as
she
anticipated
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
'll
not
keep
you
sitting
up
late
to
-
night
,
"
said
she
;
"
it
is
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
now
,
and
you
have
been
travelling
all
day
:
you
must
feel
tired
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
got
your
feet
well
warmed
,
I
'll
show
you
your
bedroom
.
<EOS>
I
've
had
the
room
next
to
mine
prepared
for
you
;
it
is
only
a
small
apartment
,
but
I
thought
you
would
like
it
better
than
one
of
the
large
front
chambers
:
to
be
sure
they
have
finer
furniture
,
but
they
are
so
dreary
and
solitary
,
I
never
sleep
in
them
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thanked
her
for
her
considerate
choice
,
and
as
I
really
felt
fatigued
with
my
long
journey
,
expressed
my
readiness
to
retire
.
<EOS>
She
took
her
candle
,
and
I
followed
her
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
First
she
went
to
see
if
the
hall
-
door
was
fastened
;
having
taken
the
key
from
the
lock
,
she
led
the
way
upstairs
.
<EOS>
The
steps
and
banisters
were
of
oak
;
the
staircase
window
was
high
and
latticed
;
both
it
and
the
long
gallery
into
which
the
bedroom
doors
opened
looked
as
if
they
belonged
to
a
church
rather
than
a
house
.
<EOS>
A
very
chill
and
vault
-
like
air
pervaded
the
stairs
and
gallery
,
suggesting
cheerless
ideas
of
space
and
solitude
;
and
I
was
glad
,
when
finally
ushered
into
my
chamber
,
to
find
it
of
small
dimensions
,
and
furnished
in
ordinary
,
modern
style
.
  
<EOS>
When
Mrs.
Fairfax
had
bidden
me
a
kind
good
-
night
,
and
I
had
fastened
my
door
,
gazed
leisurely
round
,
and
in
some
measure
effaced
the
eerie
impression
made
by
that
wide
hall
,
that
dark
and
spacious
staircase
,
and
that
long
,
cold
gallery
,
by
the
livelier
aspect
of
my
little
room
<EOS>
,
I
remembered
that
,
after
a
day
of
bodily
fatigue
and
mental
anxiety
,
I
was
now
at
last
in
safe
haven
.
<EOS>
The
impulse
of
gratitude
swelled
my
heart
,
and
I
knelt
down
at
the
bedside
,
and
offered
up
thanks
where
thanks
were
due
;
not
forgetting
,
ere
I
rose
,
to
implore
aid
on
my
further
path
,
and
the
power
of
meriting
the
kindness
which
seemed
so
frankly
offered
me
before
it
was
earned
.
<EOS>
My
couch
had
no
thorns
in
it
that
night
;
my
solitary
room
no
fears
.
<EOS>
At
once
weary
and
content
,
I
slept
soon
and
soundly
:
when
I
awoke
it
was
broad
day
.
  
<EOS>
The
chamber
looked
such
a
bright
little
place
to
me
as
the
sun
shone
in
between
the
gay
blue
chintz
window
curtains
,
showing
papered
walls
and
a
carpeted
floor
,
so
unlike
the
bare
planks
and
stained
plaster
of
Lowood
,
that
my
spirits
rose
at
the
view
.
<EOS>
Externals
have
a
great
effect
on
the
young
:
I
thought
that
a
fairer
era
of
life
was
beginning
for
me
,
one
that
was
to
have
its
flowers
and
pleasures
,
as
well
as
its
thorns
and
toils
.
<EOS>
My
faculties
,
roused
by
the
change
of
scene
,
the
new
field
offered
to
hope
,
seemed
all
astir
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
precisely
define
what
they
expected
,
but
it
was
something
pleasant
:
not
perhaps
that
day
or
that
month
,
but
at
an
indefinite
future
period
.
  
<EOS>
I
rose
;
I
dressed
myself
with
care
:
obliged
to
be
plain
 
for
I
had
no
article
of
attire
that
was
not
made
with
extreme
simplicity
 
<EOS>
I
was
still
by
nature
solicitous
to
be
neat
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
my
habit
to
be
disregardful
of
appearance
or
careless
of
the
impression
I
made
:
on
the
contrary
,
I
ever
wished
to
look
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
to
please
as
much
as
my
want
of
beauty
would
permit
.
<EOS>
I
sometimes
regretted
that
I
was
not
handsomer
;
I
sometimes
wished
to
have
rosy
cheeks
,
a
straight
nose
,
and
small
cherry
mouth
;
I
desired
to
be
tall
,
stately
,
and
finely
developed
in
figure
;
I
felt
it
a
misfortune
that
I
was
so
little
,
so
pale
,
and
had
features
so
irregular
and
so
marked
.
<EOS>
And
why
had
I
these
aspirations
and
these
regrets
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
to
say
:
I
could
not
then
distinctly
say
it
to
myself
;
yet
I
had
a
reason
,
and
a
logical
,
natural
reason
too
.
<EOS>
However
,
when
I
had
brushed
my
hair
very
smooth
,
and
put
on
my
black
frock
 
which
,
Quakerlike
as
it
was
,
at
least
had
the
merit
of
fitting
to
a
nicety
 
and
adjusted
my
clean
white
tucker
,
I
thought
I
should
do
respectably
enough
to
appear
before
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
and
that
my
new
pupil
would
not
at
least
recoil
from
me
with
antipathy
.
<EOS>
Having
opened
my
chamber
window
,
and
seen
that
I
left
all
things
straight
and
neat
on
the
toilet
table
,
I
ventured
forth
.
  
<EOS>
Traversing
the
long
and
matted
gallery
,
I
descended
the
slippery
steps
of
oak
;
then
I
gained
the
hall
:
I
halted
there
a
minute
;
I
looked
at
some
pictures
on
the
walls
(
one
,
I
remember
,
represented
a
grim
man
in
a
cuirass
,
and
one
a
lady
with
powdered
hair
and
a
pearl
necklace
)
,
at
a
bronze
lamp
pendent
from
the
ceiling
,
at
a
great
clock
whose
case
was
of
oak
curiously
carved
,
and
ebon
black
with
time
and
rubbing
.
<EOS>
Everything
appeared
very
stately
and
imposing
to
me
;
but
then
I
was
so
little
accustomed
to
grandeur
.
<EOS>
The
hall
-
door
,
which
was
half
of
glass
,
stood
open
;
I
stepped
over
the
threshold

It
was
a
fine
autumn
morning
;
the
early
sun
shone
serenely
on
embrowned
groves
and
still
green
fields
;
advancing
on
to
the
lawn
,
I
looked
up
and
surveyed
the
front
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
It
was
three
storeys
high
,
of
proportions
not
vast
,
though
considerable
:
a
gentleman
's
manor
-
house
,
not
a
nobleman
's
seat
:
battlements
round
the
top
gave
it
a
picturesque
look
.
<EOS>
Its
grey
front
stood
out
well
from
the
background
of
a
rookery
,
whose
cawing
tenants
were
now
on
the
wing
:
they
flew
over
the
lawn
and
grounds
to
alight
in
a
great
meadow
,
from
which
these
were
separated
by
a
sunk
fence
,
and
where
an
array
of
mighty
old
thorn
trees
,
strong
,
knotty
,
and
broad
as
oaks
,
at
once
explained
the
etymology
of
the
mansion
's
designation
.
<EOS>
Farther
off
were
hills
:
not
so
lofty
as
those
round
Lowood
,
nor
so
craggy
,
nor
so
like
barriers
of
separation
from
the
living
world
;
but
yet
quiet
and
lonely
hills
enough
,
and
seeming
to
embrace
Thornfield
with
a
seclusion
I
had
not
expected
to
find
existent
so
near
the
stirring
locality
of
Millcote
.
<EOS>
A
little
hamlet
,
whose
roofs
were
blent
with
trees
,
straggled
up
the
side
of
one
of
these
hills
;
the
church
of
the
district
stood
nearer
Thornfield
:
<EOS>
its
old
tower
-
top
looked
over
a
knoll
between
the
house
and
gates
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
yet
enjoying
the
calm
prospect
and
pleasant
fresh
air
,
yet
listening
with
delight
to
the
cawing
of
the
rooks
,
yet
surveying
the
wide
,
hoary
front
of
the
hall
,
and
thinking
what
a
great
place
it
was
for
one
lonely
little
dame
like
Mrs.
Fairfax
to
inhabit
,
when
that
lady
appeared
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
out
already
?
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
are
an
early
riser
.
<EOS>
"
I
went
up
to
her
,
and
was
received
with
an
affable
kiss
and
shake
of
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
like
Thornfield
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
<EOS>
I
told
her
I
liked
it
very
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
,
"
it
is
a
pretty
place
;
but
I
fear
it
will
be
getting
out
of
order
,
unless
Mr.
Rochester
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
come
and
reside
here
permanently
;
or
,
at
least
,
visit
it
rather
oftener
:
<EOS>
great
houses
and
fine
grounds
require
the
presence
of
the
proprietor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rochester
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
owner
of
Thornfield
,
"
she
responded
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
not
know
he
was
called
Rochester
?
"
  
<EOS>
Of
course
I
did
not
 
I
had
never
heard
of
him
before
;
but
the
old
lady
seemed
to
regard
his
existence
as
a
universally
understood
fact
,
with
which
everybody
must
be
acquainted
by
instinct
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
"
I
continued
,
"
Thornfield
belonged
to
you
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
me
?
<EOS>
Bless
you
,
child
;
what
an
idea
!
<EOS>
To
me
!
<EOS>
I
am
only
the
housekeeper
 
the
manager
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
I
am
distantly
related
to
the
Rochesters
by
the
mother
's
side
,
or
at
least
my
husband
was
;
he
was
a
clergyman
,
incumbent
of
Hay
 
that
little
village
yonder
on
the
hill
 
and
that
church
near
the
gates
was
his
.
<EOS>
The
present
Mr.
Rochester
's
mother
was
a
Fairfax
,
and
second
cousin
to
my
husband
:
<EOS>
but
I
never
presume
on
the
connection
 
<EOS>
in
fact
,
it
is
nothing
to
me
;
I
consider
myself
quite
in
the
light
of
an
ordinary
housekeeper
:
my
employer
is
always
civil
,
and
I
expect
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
the
little
girl
 
<EOS>
my
pupil
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
Mr.
Rochester
's
ward
;
he
commissioned
me
to
find
a
governess
for
her
.
<EOS>
He
intended
to
have
her
brought
up
in
shire
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
Here
she
comes
,
with
her
"
bonne
,
"
as
she
calls
her
nurse
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
enigma
then
was
explained
:
this
affable
and
kind
little
widow
was
no
great
dame
;
but
a
dependant
like
myself
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
like
her
the
worse
for
that
;
on
the
contrary
,
I
felt
better
pleased
than
ever
.
<EOS>
The
equality
between
her
and
me
was
real
;
not
the
mere
result
of
condescension
on
her
part
:
so
much
the
better
 
<EOS>
my
position
was
all
the
freer
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
was
meditating
on
this
discovery
,
a
little
girl
,
followed
by
her
attendant
,
came
running
up
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
my
pupil
,
who
did
not
at
first
appear
to
notice
me
:
she
was
quite
a
child
,
perhaps
seven
or
eight
years
old
,
slightly
built
,
with
a
pale
,
small
-
featured
face
,
and
a
redundancy
of
hair
falling
in
curls
to
her
waist
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
morning
,
Miss
Adela
,
"
said
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
Come
and
speak
to
the
lady
who
is
to
teach
you
,
and
to
make
you
a
clever
woman
some
day
.
<EOS>
"
She
approached
.
  
<EOS>
"
C'est
la
ma
gouverante
!
<EOS>
"
said
she
,
pointing
to
me
,
and
addressing
her
nurse
;
who
answered
    
"
Mais
oui
,
certainement
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Are
they
foreigners
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
amazed
at
hearing
the
French
language
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
nurse
is
a
foreigner
,
and
Adela
was
born
on
the
Continent
;
and
,
I
believe
,
never
left
it
till
within
six
months
ago
.
<EOS>
When
she
first
came
here
she
could
speak
no
English
;
now
she
can
make
shift
to
talk
it
a
little
:
I
do
n't
understand
her
,
she
mixes
it
so
with
French
;
but
you
will
make
out
her
meaning
very
well
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fortunately
I
had
had
the
advantage
of
being
taught
French
by
a
French
lady
;
and
as
I
had
always
made
a
point
of
conversing
with
Madame
Pierrot
as
often
as
I
could
,
and
had
besides
,
during
the
last
seven
years
,
learnt
a
portion
of
French
by
heart
daily
 
applying
myself
to
take
pains
with
my
accent
,
and
imitating
as
closely
as
possible
the
pronunciation
of
my
teacher
,
I
had
acquired
a
certain
degree
of
readiness
and
correctness
in
the
language
,
and
was
not
likely
to
be
much
at
a
loss
with
Mademoiselle
Adela
.
<EOS>
She
came
and
shook
hand
with
me
when
she
heard
that
I
was
her
governess
;
and
as
I
led
her
in
to
breakfast
,
I
addressed
some
phrases
to
her
in
her
own
tongue
<EOS>
:
she
replied
briefly
at
first
,
but
after
we
were
seated
at
the
table
,
and
she
had
examined
me
some
ten
minutes
with
her
large
hazel
eyes
,
she
suddenly
commenced
chattering
fluently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
cried
she
,
in
French
,
"
you
speak
my
language
as
well
as
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
does
:
I
can
talk
to
you
as
I
can
to
him
,
and
so
can
Sophie
.
<EOS>
She
will
be
glad
<EOS>
:
nobody
here
understands
her
:
<EOS>
Madame
Fairfax
is
all
English
.
<EOS>
Sophie
is
my
nurse
;
she
came
with
me
over
the
sea
in
a
great
ship
with
a
chimney
that
smoked
 
how
it
did
smoke
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
was
sick
,
and
so
was
Sophie
,
and
so
was
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
lay
down
on
a
sofa
in
a
pretty
room
called
the
salon
,
and
Sophie
<EOS>
and
I
had
little
beds
in
another
place
.
<EOS>
I
nearly
fell
out
of
mine
;
it
was
like
a
shelf
.
<EOS>
And
Mademoiselle
 
what
is
your
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eyre
 
Jane
Eyre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aire
?
<EOS>
Bah
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
it
.
<EOS>
Well
,
our
ship
stopped
in
the
morning
,
before
it
was
quite
daylight
,
at
a
great
city
 
a
huge
city
,
with
very
dark
houses
and
all
smoky
;
not
at
all
like
the
pretty
clean
town
I
came
from
;
and
Mr.
Rochester
carried
me
in
his
arms
over
a
plank
to
the
land
,
and
Sophie
came
after
,
and
we
all
got
into
a
coach
,
which
took
us
to
a
beautiful
large
house
,
larger
than
this
and
finer
,
called
an
hotel
.
<EOS>
We
stayed
there
nearly
a
week
:
I
and
Sophie
used
to
walk
every
day
in
a
great
green
place
full
of
trees
,
called
the
Park
;
and
there
were
many
children
there
besides
me
,
and
a
pond
with
beautiful
birds
in
it
,
that
I
fed
with
crumbs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
understand
her
when
she
runs
on
so
fast
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
  
<EOS>
I
understood
her
very
well
,
for
I
had
been
accustomed
to
the
fluent
tongue
of
Madame
Pierrot
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
"
continued
the
good
lady
,
"
you
would
ask
her
a
question
or
two
about
her
parents
:
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
she
remembers
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Adele
,
"
I
inquired
,
"
with
whom
did
you
live
when
you
were
in
that
pretty
clean
town
you
spoke
of
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
lived
long
ago
with
mama
;
but
she
is
gone
to
the
Holy
Virgin
.
<EOS>
Mama
used
to
teach
me
to
dance
and
sing
,
and
to
say
verses
.
<EOS>
A
great
many
gentlemen
and
ladies
came
to
see
mama
,
and
I
used
to
dance
before
them
,
or
to
sit
on
their
knees
and
sing
to
them
:
<EOS>
I
liked
it
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
let
you
hear
me
sing
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
finished
her
breakfast
,
so
I
permitted
her
to
give
a
specimen
of
her
accomplishments
.
<EOS>
Descending
from
her
chair
,
she
came
and
placed
herself
on
my
knee
;
then
,
folding
her
little
hands
demurely
before
her
,
shaking
back
her
curls
and
lifting
her
eyes
to
the
ceiling
,
she
commenced
singing
a
song
from
some
opera
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
strain
of
a
forsaken
lady
,
who
,
after
bewailing
the
perfidy
of
her
lover
,
calls
pride
to
her
aid
;
desires
her
attendant
to
deck
her
in
her
brightest
jewels
and
richest
robes
,
and
resolves
to
meet
the
false
one
that
night
at
a
ball
,
and
prove
to
him
,
by
the
gaiety
of
her
demeanour
,
how
little
his
desertion
has
affected
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
subject
seemed
strangely
chosen
for
an
infant
singer
;
but
I
suppose
the
point
of
the
exhibition
lay
in
hearing
the
notes
of
love
and
jealousy
warbled
with
the
lisp
of
childhood
;
and
in
very
bad
taste
that
point
was
:
at
least
I
thought
so
.
  
<EOS>
Adele
sang
the
canzonette
tunefully
enough
,
and
with
the
_
naivete
_
of
her
age
.
<EOS>
This
achieved
,
she
jumped
from
my
knee
and
said
,
"
Now
,
Mademoiselle
,
I
will
repeat
you
some
poetry
.
"
  
<EOS>
Assuming
an
attitude
,
she
began
,
"
La
Ligue
des
Rats
:
fable
de
La
Fontaine
.
"
<EOS>
She
then
declaimed
the
little
piece
with
an
attention
to
punctuation
and
emphasis
,
a
flexibility
of
voice
and
an
appropriateness
of
gesture
,
very
unusual
indeed
at
her
age
,
and
which
proved
she
had
been
carefully
trained
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
your
mama
who
taught
you
that
piece
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
she
just
used
to
say
it
in
this
way
:
"
Qu
'
avez
vous
donc
?
<EOS>
lui
dit
un
de
ces
rats
;
parlez
!
"
<EOS>
She
made
me
lift
my
hand
 
<EOS>
so
 
to
remind
me
to
raise
my
voice
at
the
question
.
<EOS>
Now
shall
I
dance
for
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
that
will
do
:
but
after
your
mama
went
to
the
Holy
Virgin
,
as
you
say
,
with
whom
did
you
live
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
With
Madame
Frederic
and
her
husband
:
she
took
care
of
me
,
but
she
is
nothing
related
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
is
poor
,
for
she
had
not
so
fine
a
house
as
mama
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
long
there
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
asked
me
if
I
would
like
to
go
and
live
with
him
in
England
,
and
I
said
yes
;
for
I
knew
Mr.
Rochester
before
I
knew
Madame
Frederic
,
and
he
was
always
kind
to
me
and
gave
me
pretty
dresses
and
toys
:
<EOS>
but
you
see
he
has
not
kept
his
word
,
for
he
has
brought
me
to
England
,
and
now
he
is
gone
back
again
himself
,
and
I
never
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
breakfast
,
Adele
and
I
withdrew
to
the
library
,
which
room
<EOS>
,
it
appears
,
Mr.
Rochester
had
directed
should
be
used
as
the
schoolroom
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
books
were
locked
up
behind
glass
doors
;
but
there
was
one
bookcase
left
open
containing
everything
that
could
be
needed
in
the
way
of
elementary
works
,
and
several
volumes
of
light
literature
,
poetry
,
biography
,
travels
,
a
few
romances
,
&
<EOS>
c.
I
suppose
he
had
considered
that
these
were
all
the
governess
would
require
for
her
private
perusal
;
and
,
indeed
,
they
contented
me
amply
for
the
present
;
compared
with
the
scanty
pickings
I
had
now
and
then
been
able
to
glean
at
Lowood
,
they
seemed
to
offer
an
abundant
harvest
of
entertainment
and
information
.
<EOS>
In
this
room
,
too
,
there
was
a
cabinet
piano
,
quite
new
and
of
superior
tone
;
also
an
easel
for
painting
and
a
pair
of
globes
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
my
pupil
sufficiently
docile
,
though
disinclined
to
apply
:
she
had
not
been
used
to
regular
occupation
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
I
felt
it
would
be
injudicious
to
confine
her
too
much
at
first
;
so
,
when
I
had
talked
to
her
a
great
deal
,
and
got
her
to
learn
a
little
,
and
when
the
morning
had
advanced
to
noon
,
I
allowed
her
to
return
to
her
nurse
.
<EOS>
I
then
proposed
to
occupy
myself
till
dinner
-
time
in
drawing
some
little
sketches
for
her
use
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
was
going
upstairs
to
fetch
my
portfolio
and
pencils
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
called
to
me
:
"
Your
morning
school
-
hours
are
over
now
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
a
room
the
folding
-
doors
of
which
stood
open
:
I
went
in
when
she
addressed
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
large
,
stately
apartment
,
with
purple
chairs
and
curtains
,
a
Turkey
carpet
,
walnut
-
panelled
walls
,
one
vast
window
rich
in
slanted
glass
,
and
a
lofty
ceiling
,
nobly
moulded
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
was
dusting
some
vases
of
fine
purple
spar
,
which
stood
on
a
sideboard
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
beautiful
room
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
,
as
I
looked
round
;
for
I
had
never
before
seen
any
half
so
imposing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
this
is
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
opened
the
window
,
to
let
in
a
little
air
and
sunshine
;
for
everything
gets
so
damp
in
apartments
that
are
seldom
inhabited
;
the
drawing
-
room
yonder
feels
like
a
vault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
pointed
to
a
wide
arch
corresponding
to
the
window
,
and
hung
like
it
with
a
Tyrian
-
dyed
curtain
,
now
looped
up
.
<EOS>
Mounting
to
it
by
two
broad
steps
,
and
looking
through
,
I
thought
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
fairy
place
,
so
bright
to
my
novice
-
eyes
<EOS>
appeared
the
view
beyond
.
<EOS>
Yet
it
was
merely
a
very
pretty
drawing
-
room
,
and
within
it
a
boudoir
<EOS>
,
both
spread
with
white
carpets
,
on
which
seemed
laid
brilliant
garlands
of
flowers
;
both
ceiled
with
snowy
mouldings
of
white
grapes
and
vine
-
leaves
,
beneath
which
glowed
in
rich
contrast
crimson
couches
and
ottomans
;
while
the
ornaments
on
the
pale
Parian
mantelpiece
were
of
sparkling
Bohemian
glass
,
ruby
red
;
and
between
the
windows
large
mirrors
repeated
the
general
blending
of
snow
and
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
what
order
you
keep
these
rooms
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
!
"
said
I.
"
<EOS>
No
dust
,
no
canvas
coverings
:
except
that
the
air
feels
chilly
,
one
would
think
they
were
inhabited
daily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Miss
Eyre
,
though
Mr.
Rochester
's
visits
here
are
rare
,
they
are
always
sudden
and
unexpected
;
and
as
I
observed
that
it
put
him
out
to
find
everything
swathed
up
,
and
to
have
a
bustle
of
arrangement
on
his
arrival
,
I
thought
it
best
to
keep
the
rooms
in
readiness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr.
Rochester
an
exacting
,
fastidious
sort
of
man
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
particularly
so
<EOS>
;
but
he
has
a
gentleman
's
tastes
and
habits
,
and
he
expects
to
have
things
managed
in
conformity
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
like
him
?
<EOS>
Is
he
generally
liked
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
the
family
have
always
been
respected
here
.
<EOS>
Almost
all
the
land
in
this
neighbourhood
,
as
far
as
you
can
see
,
has
belonged
to
the
Rochesters
time
out
of
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
leaving
his
land
out
of
the
question
,
do
you
like
him
?
<EOS>
Is
he
liked
for
himself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
cause
to
do
otherwise
than
like
him
;
and
I
believe
he
is
considered
a
just
and
liberal
landlord
by
his
tenants
:
but
he
has
never
lived
much
amongst
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
has
he
no
peculiarities
?
<EOS>
What
,
in
short
,
is
his
character
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
his
character
is
unimpeachable
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
He
is
rather
peculiar
,
perhaps
:
he
has
travelled
a
great
deal
,
and
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
,
I
should
think
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
is
clever
,
but
I
never
had
much
conversation
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
what
way
is
he
peculiar
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
 
<EOS>
it
is
not
easy
to
describe
 
nothing
striking
,
but
you
feel
it
when
he
speaks
to
you
;
you
can
not
be
always
sure
whether
he
is
in
jest
or
earnest
,
whether
he
is
pleased
or
the
contrary
;
you
do
n't
thoroughly
understand
him
,
in
short
 
at
least
,
I
do
n't
:
but
it
is
of
no
consequence
<EOS>
,
he
is
a
very
good
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
all
the
account
I
got
from
Mrs.
Fairfax
of
her
employer
and
mine
.
<EOS>
There
are
people
who
seem
to
have
no
notion
of
sketching
a
character
,
or
observing
and
describing
salient
points
,
either
in
persons
or
things
:
the
good
lady
evidently
belonged
to
this
class
;
my
queries
puzzled
,
but
did
not
draw
her
out
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
was
Mr.
Rochester
in
her
eyes
;
a
gentleman
,
a
landed
proprietor
 
nothing
more
:
she
inquired
and
searched
no
further
,
and
evidently
wondered
at
my
wish
to
gain
a
more
definite
notion
of
his
identity
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
left
the
dining
-
room
,
she
proposed
to
show
me
over
the
rest
of
the
house
;
and
I
followed
her
upstairs
and
downstairs
,
admiring
as
I
went
;
for
all
was
well
arranged
and
handsome
.
<EOS>
The
large
front
chambers
I
thought
especially
grand
:
and
some
of
the
third
-
storey
rooms
,
though
dark
and
low
,
were
interesting
from
their
air
of
antiquity
.
<EOS>
The
furniture
once
appropriated
to
the
lower
apartments
had
from
time
to
time
been
removed
here
,
as
fashions
changed
:
and
the
imperfect
light
entering
by
their
narrow
casement
showed
bedsteads
of
a
hundred
years
old
;
chests
in
oak
or
walnut
,
looking
,
with
their
strange
carvings
of
palm
branches
and
cherubs
'
heads
,
like
types
of
the
Hebrew
ark
;
<EOS>
rows
of
venerable
chairs
,
high
-
backed
and
narrow
;
stools
still
more
antiquated
,
on
whose
cushioned
tops
were
yet
apparent
traces
of
half
-
effaced
embroideries
,
wrought
by
fingers
that
for
two
generations
had
been
coffin
-
dust
.
<EOS>
All
these
relics
gave
to
the
third
storey
of
Thornfield
Hall
the
aspect
of
a
home
of
the
past
:
a
shrine
of
memory
.
<EOS>
I
liked
the
hush
,
the
gloom
,
the
quaintness
of
these
retreats
in
the
day
;
but
I
by
no
means
coveted
a
night
's
repose
on
one
of
those
wide
and
heavy
beds
:
shut
in
,
some
of
them
,
with
doors
of
oak
;
shaded
,
others
,
with
wrought
old
English
hangings
crusted
with
thick
work
,
portraying
effigies
of
strange
flowers
,
and
stranger
birds
,
and
strangest
human
beings
,
 
all
which
would
have
looked
strange
,
indeed
,
by
the
pallid
gleam
of
moonlight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
the
servants
sleep
in
these
rooms
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
they
occupy
a
range
of
smaller
apartments
to
the
back
;
no
one
ever
sleeps
here
:
one
would
almost
say
that
,
if
there
were
a
ghost
at
Thornfield
Hall
,
this
would
be
its
haunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
think
:
<EOS>
you
have
no
ghost
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
that
I
ever
heard
of
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
any
traditions
of
one
?
<EOS>
no
legends
or
ghost
stories
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
not
.
<EOS>
And
yet
it
is
said
the
Rochesters
have
been
rather
a
violent
than
a
quiet
race
in
their
time
:
perhaps
,
though
,
that
is
the
reason
they
rest
tranquilly
in
their
graves
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
 
"
after
life
's
fitful
fever
they
sleep
well
,
"
"
I
muttered
.
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
now
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
?
"
<EOS>
for
she
was
moving
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
On
to
the
leads
;
will
you
come
and
see
the
view
from
thence
?
<EOS>
"
I
followed
still
,
up
a
very
narrow
staircase
to
the
attics
,
and
thence
by
a
ladder
and
through
a
trap
-
door
to
the
roof
of
the
hall
.
<EOS>
I
was
now
on
a
level
with
the
crow
colony
,
and
could
see
into
their
nests
.
<EOS>
Leaning
over
the
battlements
and
looking
far
down
,
I
surveyed
the
grounds
laid
out
like
a
map
:
the
bright
and
velvet
lawn
closely
girdling
the
grey
base
of
the
mansion
;
the
field
,
wide
as
a
park
,
dotted
with
its
ancient
timber
;
the
wood
,
dun
and
sere
,
divided
by
a
path
visibly
overgrown
,
greener
with
moss
than
the
trees
were
with
foliage
;
the
church
at
the
gates
,
the
road
,
the
tranquil
hills
,
all
reposing
in
the
autumn
day
's
sun
;
the
horizon
bounded
by
a
propitious
sky
,
azure
,
marbled
with
pearly
white
.
<EOS>
No
feature
in
the
scene
was
extraordinary
,
but
all
was
pleasing
.
<EOS>
When
I
turned
from
it
and
repassed
the
trap
-
door
,
I
could
scarcely
see
my
way
down
the
ladder
;
the
attic
seemed
black
as
a
vault
compared
with
that
arch
of
blue
air
to
which
I
had
been
looking
up
,
and
to
that
sunlit
scene
of
grove
,
pasture
,
and
green
hill
,
of
which
the
hall
was
the
centre
,
and
over
which
I
had
been
gazing
with
delight
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
stayed
behind
a
moment
to
fasten
the
trap
-
door
;
I
,
by
drift
of
groping
,
found
the
outlet
from
the
attic
,
and
proceeded
to
descend
the
narrow
garret
staircase
.
<EOS>
I
lingered
in
the
long
passage
to
which
this
led
,
separating
the
front
and
back
rooms
of
the
third
storey
:
narrow
,
low
,
and
dim
,
with
only
one
little
window
at
the
far
end
,
and
looking
,
with
its
two
rows
of
small
black
doors
all
shut
,
like
a
corridor
in
some
Bluebeard
's
castle
.
  
<EOS>
While
I
paced
softly
on
,
the
last
sound
I
expected
to
hear
in
so
still
a
region
,
a
laugh
,
struck
my
ear
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
curious
laugh
;
distinct
,
formal
,
mirthless
.
<EOS>
I
stopped
:
the
sound
ceased
,
only
for
an
instant
;
it
began
again
,
louder
:
for
at
first
,
though
distinct
,
it
was
very
low
.
<EOS>
It
passed
off
in
a
clamorous
peal
that
seemed
to
wake
an
echo
in
every
lonely
chamber
;
though
it
originated
but
in
one
,
and
I
could
have
pointed
out
the
door
whence
the
accents
issued
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Fairfax
!
<EOS>
"
I
called
out
:
for
I
now
heard
her
descending
the
great
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hear
that
loud
laugh
?
<EOS>
Who
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Some
of
the
servants
,
very
likely
,
"
she
answered
:
"
perhaps
Grace
Poole
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hear
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
again
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
plainly
:
I
often
hear
her
:
she
sews
in
one
of
these
rooms
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
Leah
is
with
her
;
they
are
frequently
noisy
together
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
laugh
was
repeated
in
its
low
,
syllabic
tone
,
and
terminated
in
an
odd
murmur
.
  
<EOS>
"
Grace
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
  
<EOS>
I
really
did
not
expect
any
Grace
to
answer
;
for
the
laugh
was
as
tragic
,
as
preternatural
a
laugh
as
any
I
ever
heard
;
and
,
but
that
it
was
high
noon
,
and
that
no
circumstance
of
ghostliness
accompanied
the
curious
cachinnation
;
but
that
neither
scene
nor
season
favoured
fear
,
I
should
have
been
superstitiously
afraid
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
event
showed
me
I
was
a
fool
for
entertaining
a
sense
even
of
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
The
door
nearest
me
opened
,
and
a
servant
came
out
,
 
a
woman
of
between
thirty
and
forty
;
a
set
,
square
-
made
figure
,
red
-
haired
,
and
with
a
hard
,
plain
face
:
any
apparition
less
romantic
or
less
ghostly
could
scarcely
be
conceived
.
  
<EOS>
"
Too
much
noise
,
Grace
,
"
said
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
Remember
directions
!
"
<EOS>
Grace
curtseyed
silently
and
went
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
person
we
have
to
sew
and
assist
Leah
in
her
housemaid
's
work
,
"
continued
the
widow
;
"
not
altogether
unobjectionable
in
some
points
,
but
she
does
well
enough
.
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
bye
<EOS>
,
how
have
you
got
on
with
your
new
pupil
this
morning
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
conversation
,
thus
turned
on
Adele
,
continued
till
we
reached
the
light
and
cheerful
region
below
.
<EOS>
Adele
came
running
to
meet
us
in
the
hall
,
exclaiming
    
"
Mesdames
,
vous
etes
servies
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
adding
,
"
J'ai
bien
faim
,
moi
!
"
  
<EOS>
We
found
dinner
ready
,
and
waiting
for
us
in
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
room
.
    
<EOS>
The
promise
of
a
smooth
career
,
which
my
first
calm
introduction
to
Thornfield
Hall
seemed
to
pledge
,
was
not
belied
on
a
longer
acquaintance
with
the
place
and
its
inmates
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
turned
out
to
be
what
she
appeared
,
a
placid
-
tempered
,
kind
-
natured
woman
,
of
competent
education
and
average
intelligence
.
<EOS>
My
pupil
was
a
lively
child
,
who
had
been
spoilt
and
indulged
,
and
therefore
was
sometimes
wayward
;
but
as
she
was
committed
entirely
to
my
care
,
and
no
injudicious
interference
from
any
quarter
ever
thwarted
my
plans
for
her
improvement
,
she
soon
forgot
her
little
freaks
,
and
became
obedient
and
teachable
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
great
talents
,
no
marked
traits
of
character
,
no
peculiar
development
of
feeling
or
taste
which
raised
her
one
inch
above
the
ordinary
level
of
childhood
;
but
neither
had
she
any
deficiency
or
vice
which
sunk
her
below
it
.
<EOS>
She
made
reasonable
progress
,
entertained
for
me
a
vivacious
,
though
perhaps
not
very
profound
,
affection
;
and
by
her
simplicity
,
gay
prattle
,
and
efforts
to
please
,
inspired
me
,
in
return
,
with
a
degree
of
attachment
sufficient
to
make
us
both
content
in
each
other
's
society
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
_
par
parenthese
_
,
will
be
thought
cool
language
by
persons
who
entertain
solemn
doctrines
about
the
angelic
nature
of
children
,
and
the
duty
of
those
charged
with
their
education
to
conceive
for
them
an
idolatrous
devotion
:
but
I
am
not
writing
to
flatter
parental
egotism
,
to
echo
ca
nt
,
or
prop
up
humbug
;
I
am
merely
telling
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
felt
a
conscientious
solicitude
for
Adele
's
welfare
and
progress
,
and
a
quiet
liking
for
her
little
self
:
just
as
I
cherished
towards
Mrs.
Fairfax
a
thankfulness
for
her
kindness
,
and
a
pleasure
in
her
society
proportionate
to
the
tranquil
regard
she
had
for
me
,
and
the
moderation
of
her
mind
and
character
.
  
<EOS>
Anybody
may
blame
me
who
likes
,
when
I
add
further
,
that
,
now
and
then
,
when
I
took
a
walk
by
myself
in
the
grounds
;
when
I
went
down
to
the
gates
and
looked
through
them
along
the
road
;
or
when
,
while
Adele
played
with
her
nurse
,
and
Mrs.
Fairfax
made
jellies
in
the
storeroom
,
I
climbed
the
three
staircases
,
raised
the
trap
-
door
of
the
attic
,
and
having
reached
the
leads
,
looked
out
afar
over
sequestered
field
and
hill
,
and
along
dim
sky
-
line
 
<EOS>
that
then
I
longed
for
a
power
of
vision
which
might
overpass
that
limit
;
which
might
reach
the
busy
world
,
towns
,
regions
full
of
life
<EOS>
I
had
heard
of
but
never
seen
 
that
then
I
desired
more
of
practical
experience
than
I
possessed
;
more
of
intercourse
with
my
kind
,
of
acquaintance
with
variety
of
character
,
than
was
here
within
my
reach
.
<EOS>
I
valued
what
was
good
in
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
and
what
was
good
in
Adele
;
but
I
believed
in
the
existence
of
other
and
more
vivid
kinds
of
goodness
,
and
what
I
believed
in
I
wished
to
behold
.
  
<EOS>
Who
blames
me
?
<EOS>
Many
,
no
doubt
;
and
I
shall
be
called
discontented
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
it
:
the
restlessness
was
in
my
nature
;
it
agitated
me
to
pain
sometimes
.
<EOS>
Then
my
sole
relief
was
to
walk
along
the
corridor
of
the
third
storey
,
backwards
and
forwards
,
safe
in
the
silence
and
solitude
of
the
spot
,
and
allow
my
mind
's
eye
to
dwell
on
whatever
bright
visions
rose
before
it
 
and
,
certainly
,
they
were
many
and
glowing
;
<EOS>
to
let
my
heart
be
heaved
by
the
exultant
movement
,
which
,
while
it
swelled
it
in
trouble
,
expanded
it
with
life
;
and
,
best
of
all
,
to
open
my
inward
ear
to
a
tale
that
was
never
ended
 
a
tale
my
imagination
created
,
and
narrated
continuously
;
quickened
with
all
of
incident
,
life
,
fire
,
feeling
,
that
I
desired
and
had
not
in
my
actual
existence
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
in
vain
to
say
human
beings
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
tranquillity
:
they
must
have
action
;
and
they
will
make
it
if
they
can
not
find
it
.
<EOS>
Millions
are
condemned
to
a
stiller
doom
than
mine
,
and
millions
are
in
silent
revolt
against
their
lot
.
<EOS>
Nobody
knows
how
many
rebellions
besides
political
rebellions
ferment
in
the
masses
of
life
which
people
earth
.
<EOS>
Women
are
supposed
to
be
very
calm
generally
:
but
women
feel
just
as
men
feel
;
they
need
exercise
for
their
faculties
,
and
a
field
for
their
efforts
,
as
much
as
their
brothers
do
;
they
suffer
from
too
rigid
a
restraint
,
too
absolute
a
stagnation
,
precisely
as
men
would
suffer
;
and
it
is
narrow
-
minded
in
their
more
privileged
fellow
-
creatures
to
say
that
they
ought
to
confine
themselves
to
making
puddings
and
knitting
stockings
,
to
playing
on
the
piano
and
embroidering
bags
.
<EOS>
It
is
thoughtless
to
condemn
them
,
or
laugh
at
them
,
if
they
seek
to
do
more
or
learn
more
than
custom
has
pronounced
necessary
for
their
sex
.
  
<EOS>
When
thus
alone
,
I
not
unfrequently
heard
Grace
Poole
's
laugh
:
the
same
peal
,
the
same
low
,
slow
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
which
,
when
first
heard
,
had
thrilled
me
<EOS>
:
I
heard
,
too
,
her
eccentric
murmurs
;
stranger
than
her
laugh
.
<EOS>
There
were
days
when
she
was
quite
silent
;
but
there
were
others
when
I
could
not
account
for
the
sounds
she
made
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
saw
her
:
she
would
come
out
of
her
room
with
a
basin
,
or
a
plate
,
or
a
tray
in
her
hand
,
go
down
to
the
kitchen
and
shortly
return
,
generally
(
oh
,
romantic
reader
,
forgive
me
for
telling
the
plain
truth
!
)
<EOS>
bearing
a
pot
of
porter
.
<EOS>
Her
appearance
always
acted
as
a
damper
to
the
curiosity
raised
by
her
oral
oddities
:
hard
-
featured
and
staid
,
she
had
no
point
to
which
interest
could
attach
.
<EOS>
I
made
some
attempts
to
draw
her
into
conversation
,
but
she
seemed
a
person
of
few
words
:
a
monosyllabic
reply
usually
cut
short
every
effort
of
that
sort
.
  
<EOS>
The
other
members
of
the
household
,
viz
.
,
John
and
his
wife
,
Leah
the
housemaid
,
and
Sophie
the
French
nurse
,
were
decent
people
;
but
in
no
respect
remarkable
;
with
Sophie
I
used
to
talk
French
,
and
sometimes
I
asked
her
questions
about
her
native
country
;
but
she
was
not
of
a
descriptive
or
narrative
turn
,
and
generally
gave
such
vapid
and
confused
answers
as
were
calculated
rather
to
check
than
encourage
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
October
,
November
,
December
passed
away
.
<EOS>
One
afternoon
in
January
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
had
begged
a
holiday
for
Adele
,
because
she
had
a
cold
;
and
,
as
Adele
seconded
the
request
with
an
ardour
that
reminded
me
how
precious
occasional
holidays
had
been
to
me
in
my
own
childhood
,
I
accorded
it
,
deeming
that
I
did
well
in
showing
pliability
on
the
point
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
,
calm
day
,
though
very
cold
;
I
was
tired
of
sitting
still
in
the
library
through
a
whole
long
morning
:
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
had
just
written
a
letter
which
was
waiting
to
be
posted
,
so
I
put
on
my
bonnet
and
cloak
and
volunteered
to
carry
it
to
Hay
;
the
distance
,
two
miles
,
would
be
a
pleasant
winter
afternoon
walk
.
<EOS>
Having
seen
Adele
comfortably
seated
in
her
little
chair
by
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
parlour
fireside
,
and
given
her
her
best
wax
doll
(
which
I
usually
kept
enveloped
in
silver
paper
in
a
drawer
)
to
play
with
,
and
a
story
-
book
for
change
of
amusement
;
and
having
replied
to
her
"
Revenez
bientot
,
ma
bonne
amie
,
ma
chere
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Jeannette
,
"
with
a
kiss
I
set
out
.
  
<EOS>
The
ground
was
hard
,
the
air
was
still
,
my
road
was
lonely
;
I
walked
fast
till
I
got
warm
,
and
then
I
walked
slowly
to
enjoy
and
analyse
the
species
of
pleasure
brooding
for
me
in
the
hour
and
situation
.
<EOS>
It
was
three
o'clock
;
the
church
bell
tolled
as
I
passed
under
the
belfry
:
the
charm
of
the
hour
lay
in
its
approaching
dimness
,
in
the
low
-
gliding
and
pale
-
beaming
sun
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
mile
from
Thornfield
,
in
a
lane
noted
for
wild
roses
in
summer
,
for
nuts
and
blackberries
in
autumn
,
and
even
now
possessing
a
few
coral
treasures
in
hips
and
haws
,
but
whose
best
winter
delight
lay
in
its
utter
solitude
and
leafless
repose
.
<EOS>
If
a
breath
of
air
stirred
,
it
made
no
sound
here
;
for
there
was
not
a
holly
,
not
an
evergreen
to
rustle
,
and
the
stripped
hawthorn
and
hazel
<EOS>
bushes
were
as
still
as
the
white
,
worn
stones
which
causewayed
the
middle
of
the
path
.
<EOS>
Far
and
wide
,
on
each
side
,
there
were
only
fields
,
where
no
cattle
now
browsed
;
and
<EOS>
the
little
brown
birds
,
which
stirred
occasionally
in
the
hedge
,
looked
like
single
russet
leaves
that
had
forgotten
to
drop
.
  
<EOS>
This
lane
inclined
up
-
hill
all
the
way
to
Hay
;
having
reached
the
middle
,
I
sat
down
on
a
stile
which
led
thence
into
a
field
.
<EOS>
Gathering
my
mantle
about
me
,
and
sheltering
my
hands
in
my
muff
,
I
did
not
feel
the
cold
,
though
it
froze
keenly
;
as
was
attested
by
a
sheet
of
ice
covering
the
causeway
,
where
a
little
brooklet
,
now
congealed
,
had
overflowed
after
a
rapid
thaw
some
days
since
.
<EOS>
From
my
seat
I
could
look
down
on
Thornfield
:
the
grey
and
battlemented
hall
was
the
principal
object
in
the
vale
below
me
;
its
woods
and
dark
rookery
rose
against
the
west
.
<EOS>
I
lingered
till
the
sun
went
down
amongst
the
trees
,
and
sank
crimson
and
clear
behind
them
.
<EOS>
I
then
turned
eastward
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
hill
-
top
above
me
sat
the
rising
moon
;
pale
yet
as
a
cloud
,
but
brightening
momentarily
,
she
looked
over
Hay
,
which
,
half
lost
in
trees
,
sent
up
a
blue
smoke
from
its
few
chimneys
:
it
was
yet
a
mile
distant
,
but
in
the
absolute
hush
I
could
hear
plainly
its
thin
murmurs
of
life
.
<EOS>
My
ear
,
too
,
felt
the
flow
of
currents
;
in
what
dales
and
depths
I
could
not
tell
:
but
there
were
many
hills
beyond
Hay
,
and
doubtless
many
becks
threading
their
passes
.
<EOS>
That
evening
calm
betrayed
alike
the
tinkle
of
the
nearest
streams
,
the
sough
of
the
most
remote
.
  
<EOS>
A
rude
noise
broke
on
these
fine
ripplings
and
whisperings
,
at
once
so
far
away
and
so
clear
:
<EOS>
a
positive
tramp
,
tramp
,
a
metallic
clatter
,
which
effaced
the
soft
wave
-
wanderings
;
as
,
in
a
picture
,
the
solid
mass
of
a
crag
,
or
the
rough
boles
of
a
great
oak
,
drawn
in
dark
and
strong
on
the
foreground
,
efface
the
aerial
distance
of
azure
hill
,
sunny
horizon
,
and
blended
clouds
where
tint
melts
into
tint
.
  
<EOS>
The
din
was
on
the
causeway
:
a
horse
was
coming
;
<EOS>
the
windings
of
the
lane
yet
hid
it
,
but
it
approached
.
<EOS>
I
was
just
leaving
the
stile
;
yet
,
as
the
path
was
narrow
,
I
sat
still
to
let
it
go
by
.
<EOS>
In
those
days
I
was
young
,
and
all
sorts
of
fancies
bright
and
dark
tenanted
my
mind
:
the
memories
of
nursery
stories
were
there
amongst
other
rubbish
;
and
when
they
recurred
,
maturing
youth
added
to
them
a
vigour
and
vividness
beyond
what
childhood
could
give
.
<EOS>
As
this
horse
approached
,
and
as
I
watched
for
it
to
appear
through
the
dusk
,
I
remembered
certain
of
Bessie
's
tales
,
wherein
figured
a
North
-
of
-
England
spirit
called
a
"
Gytrash
,
"
which
,
in
the
form
of
horse
,
mule
,
or
large
dog
,
haunted
solitary
ways
,
and
sometimes
came
upon
belated
travellers
,
as
this
horse
was
now
coming
upon
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
very
near
,
but
not
yet
in
sight
;
when
,
in
addition
to
the
tramp
,
tramp
,
I
heard
a
rush
under
the
hedge
,
and
close
down
by
the
hazel
<EOS>
stems
glided
a
great
dog
,
whose
black
and
white
colour
made
him
a
distinct
object
against
the
trees
.
<EOS>
It
was
exactly
one
form
of
Bessie
's
Gytrash
 
a
lion
-
like
creature
with
long
hair
and
a
huge
head
:
it
passed
me
,
however
,
quietly
enough
;
not
staying
to
look
up
,
with
strange
pretercanine
eyes
,
in
my
face
,
as
I
half
expected
it
would
.
<EOS>
The
horse
followed
,
 
a
tall
steed
,
and
on
its
back
a
rider
.
<EOS>
The
man
,
the
human
being
,
broke
the
spell
at
once
.
<EOS>
Nothing
ever
rode
the
Gytrash
:
it
was
always
alone
;
and
goblins
,
to
my
notions
,
though
they
might
tenant
the
dumb
carcasses
of
beasts
,
could
scarce
covet
shelter
in
the
commonplace
human
form
.
<EOS>
No
Gytrash
was
this
,
 
only
a
traveller
taking
the
short
cut
to
Millcote
.
<EOS>
He
passed
,
and
I
went
on
;
a
few
steps
,
and
<EOS>
I
turned
:
a
sliding
sound
and
an
exclamation
of
"
What
the
deuce
is
to
do
now
?
"
and
a
clattering
tumble
,
arrested
my
attention
.
<EOS>
Man
and
horse
were
down
;
they
had
slipped
on
the
sheet
of
ice
which
glazed
the
causeway
.
<EOS>
The
dog
came
bounding
back
,
and
seeing
his
master
in
a
predicament
,
and
hearing
the
horse
groan
,
barked
till
<EOS>
the
evening
hills
echoed
the
sound
,
which
was
deep
in
proportion
to
his
magnitude
.
<EOS>
He
snuffed
round
the
prostrate
group
,
and
then
he
ran
up
to
me
;
it
was
all
he
could
do
,
 
there
was
no
other
help
at
hand
to
summon
.
<EOS>
I
obeyed
him
,
and
walked
down
to
the
traveller
,
by
this
time
struggling
himself
free
of
his
steed
.
<EOS>
His
efforts
were
so
vigorous
,
I
thought
he
could
not
be
much
hurt
;
but
I
asked
him
the
question
    
"
Are
you
injured
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
he
was
swearing
,
but
am
not
certain
;
however
,
he
was
pronouncing
some
formula
which
prevented
him
from
replying
to
me
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
do
anything
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
just
stand
on
one
side
,
"
he
answered
as
he
rose
,
first
to
his
knees
,
and
then
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
I
did
;
whereupon
began
a
heaving
,
stamping
,
clattering
process
,
accompanied
by
a
barking
and
baying
which
removed
me
effectually
some
yards
'
distance
;
but
I
would
not
be
driven
quite
away
till
I
saw
the
event
.
<EOS>
This
was
finally
fortunate
;
the
horse
was
re
-
established
,
and
the
dog
was
silenced
with
a
"
Down
,
Pilot
!
"
<EOS>
The
traveller
now
,
stooping
,
felt
his
foot
and
leg
,
as
if
trying
whether
they
were
sound
;
apparently
something
ailed
them
,
for
he
halted
to
the
stile
whence
I
had
just
risen
,
and
sat
down
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
in
the
mood
for
being
useful
,
or
at
least
officious
,
I
think
,
for
I
now
drew
near
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
hurt
,
and
want
help
,
sir
,
I
can
fetch
some
one
either
from
Thornfield
Hall
or
from
Hay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
:
<EOS>
I
shall
do
:
<EOS>
I
have
no
broken
bones
,
 
only
a
sprain
;
"
and
again
he
stood
up
and
tried
his
foot
,
but
the
result
extorted
an
involuntary
"
Ugh
!
"
  
<EOS>
Something
of
daylight
still
lingered
,
and
the
moon
was
waxing
bright
:
I
could
see
him
plainly
.
<EOS>
His
figure
was
enveloped
in
a
riding
cloak
,
fur
collared
and
steel
clasped
;
its
details
were
not
apparent
,
but
I
traced
the
general
points
of
middle
height
and
considerable
breadth
of
chest
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
dark
face
,
with
stern
features
and
a
heavy
brow
;
his
eyes
and
gathered
eyebrows
looked
ireful
and
thwarted
just
now
;
he
was
past
youth
,
but
had
not
reached
middle
-
age
;
perhaps
he
might
be
thirty
-
five
.
<EOS>
I
felt
no
fear
of
him
,
and
but
little
shyness
.
<EOS>
Had
he
been
a
handsome
,
heroic-
looking
young
gentleman
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
have
dared
to
stand
thus
questioning
him
against
his
will
,
and
offering
my
services
unasked
.
<EOS>
I
had
hardly
ever
seen
a
handsome
youth
;
never
in
my
life
spoken
to
one
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
theoretical
reverence
and
homage
for
beauty
,
elegance
,
gallantry
,
fascination
;
but
had
I
met
those
qualities
incarnate
in
masculine
shape
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
known
instinctively
that
they
neither
had
nor
could
have
sympathy
with
anything
in
me
,
and
should
have
shunned
them
as
one
would
fire
,
lightning
,
or
anything
else
that
is
bright
but
antipathetic
.
  
<EOS>
If
even
this
stranger
had
smiled
and
been
good
-
humoured
to
me
when
I
addressed
him
;
if
he
had
put
off
my
offer
of
assistance
gaily
and
with
thanks
,
I
should
have
gone
on
my
way
and
not
felt
any
vocation
to
renew
inquiries
:
but
the
frown
,
the
roughness
of
the
traveller
,
set
me
at
my
ease
:
<EOS>
I
retained
my
station
when
he
waved
to
me
to
go
,
and
announced
    
"
I
can
not
think
of
leaving
you
,
sir
,
at
so
late
an
hour
,
in
this
solitary
lane
,
till
I
see
you
are
fit
to
mount
your
horse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
when
I
said
this
;
he
had
hardly
turned
his
eyes
in
my
direction
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
you
ought
to
be
at
home
yourself
,
"
said
he
,
"
if
you
have
a
home
in
this
neighbourhood
:
where
do
you
come
from
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
From
just
below
<EOS>
;
and
I
am
not
at
all
afraid
of
being
out
late
when
it
is
moonlight
:
I
will
run
over
to
Hay
for
you
with
pleasure
,
if
you
wish
it
:
indeed
,
I
am
going
there
to
post
a
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
live
just
below
 
<EOS>
do
you
mean
at
that
house
with
the
battlements
?
<EOS>
"
pointing
to
Thornfield
Hall
,
on
which
the
moon
cast
a
hoary
gleam
,
bringing
it
out
distinct
and
pale
from
the
woods
that
,
by
contrast
with
the
western
sky
,
now
seemed
one
mass
of
shadow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whose
house
is
it
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
Mr.
Rochester
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
have
never
seen
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
resident
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
tell
me
where
he
is
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
a
servant
at
the
hall
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
You
are
 
<EOS>
"
He
stopped
,
ran
his
eye
over
my
dress
,
which
,
as
usual
,
was
quite
simple
:
a
black
merino
cloak
,
a
black
beaver
bonnet
;
neither
of
them
half
fine
enough
for
a
lady's
-
maid
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
puzzled
to
decide
what
I
was
;
I
helped
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
governess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
the
governess
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
;
"
deuce
take
me
,
if
I
had
not
forgotten
!
<EOS>
The
governess
!
"
<EOS>
and
again
my
raiment
underwent
scrutiny
.
<EOS>
In
two
minutes
he
rose
from
the
stile
:
his
face
expressed
pain
when
he
tried
to
move
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
commission
you
to
fetch
help
,
"
he
said
;
"
<EOS>
but
you
may
help
me
<EOS>
a
little
yourself
,
if
you
will
be
so
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
an
umbrella
that
I
can
use
as
a
stick
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Try
to
get
hold
of
my
horse
's
bridle
and
lead
him
to
me
:
you
are
not
afraid
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
afraid
to
touch
a
horse
when
alone
,
but
when
told
to
do
it
,
I
was
disposed
to
obey
.
<EOS>
I
put
down
my
muff
on
the
stile
,
and
went
up
to
the
tall
steed
;
I
endeavoured
to
catch
the
bridle
,
but
it
was
a
spirited
thing
,
and
would
not
let
me
come
near
its
head
;
I
made
effort
on
effort
,
though
in
vain
:
meantime
,
I
was
mortally
afraid
of
its
trampling
fore
-
feet
.
<EOS>
The
traveller
waited
and
watched
for
some
time
,
and
at
last
he
laughed
.
  
<EOS>
{
I
was
mortally
afraid
of
its
trampling
forefeet
:
p107.jpg
<EOS>
}
  
"
I
see
,
"
he
said
,
"
the
mountain
will
never
be
brought
to
Mahomet
,
so
all
you
can
do
is
to
aid
Mahomet
to
go
to
the
mountain
;
I
must
beg
of
you
to
come
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
came
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Excuse
me
,
"
he
continued
:
"
necessity
compels
me
to
make
you
useful
.
"
<EOS>
He
laid
a
heavy
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
and
leaning
on
me
with
some
stress
,
limped
to
his
horse
.
<EOS>
Having
once
caught
the
bridle
,
he
mastered
it
directly
and
sprang
to
his
saddle
;
grimacing
grimly
as
he
made
the
effort
,
for
it
wrenched
his
sprain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
he
,
releasing
his
under
lip
from
a
hard
bite
,
"
just
hand
me
my
whip
;
it
lies
there
under
the
hedge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
sought
it
and
found
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
;
now
make
haste
with
the
letter
to
Hay
,
and
return
as
fast
as
you
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
touch
of
a
spurred
heel
made
his
horse
first
start
and
rear
,
and
then
bound
away
;
the
dog
rushed
in
his
traces
;
all
three
vanished
,
  
"
Like
heath
that
,
in
the
wilderness
,
The
wild
wind
whirls
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
took
up
my
muff
and
walked
on
.
<EOS>
The
incident
had
occurred
and
was
gone
for
me
:
it
<EOS>
_
was
_
an
incident
of
no
moment
,
no
romance
,
<EOS>
no
interest
in
a
sense
;
yet
it
marked
with
change
one
single
hour
of
a
monotonous
life
.
<EOS>
My
help
had
been
needed
and
claimed
;
I
had
given
it
<EOS>
:
I
was
pleased
to
have
done
something
;
trivial
,
transitory
though
the
deed
was
,
it
was
yet
an
active
thing
,
and
I
was
weary
of
an
existence
all
passive
.
<EOS>
The
new
face
,
too
,
was
like
a
new
picture
introduced
to
the
gallery
of
memory
;
and
it
was
dissimilar
to
all
the
others
hanging
there
:
firstly
,
because
it
was
masculine
;
and
,
secondly
,
because
it
was
dark
,
strong
,
and
stern
.
<EOS>
I
had
it
still
before
me
when
I
entered
Hay
,
and
slipped
the
letter
into
the
post
-
office
;
I
saw
it
as
I
walked
fast
down
-
hill
all
the
way
home
.
<EOS>
When
I
came
to
the
stile
,
I
stopped
a
minute
,
looked
round
and
listened
,
with
an
idea
that
a
horse
's
hoofs
might
ring
on
the
causeway
again
,
and
that
a
rider
in
a
cloak
,
and
a
Gytrash
-
like
Newfoundland
dog
,
might
be
again
apparent
:
I
saw
only
the
hedge
and
a
pollard
willow
before
me
,
rising
up
still
and
straight
to
meet
the
moonbeams
;
I
heard
only
the
faintest
waft
of
wind
roaming
fitful
among
the
trees
round
Thornfield
,
a
mile
distant
;
and
when
I
glanced
down
in
the
direction
of
the
murmur
,
my
eye
,
traversing
the
hall
-
front
,
caught
a
light
kindling
in
a
window
:
it
reminded
me
that
I
was
late
,
and
I
hurried
on
.
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
like
re
-
entering
Thornfield
.
<EOS>
To
pass
its
threshold
was
to
return
to
stagnation
;
to
cross
the
silent
hall
,
to
ascend
the
darksome
staircase
,
to
seek
my
own
lonely
little
room
,
and
then
to
meet
tranquil
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
and
spend
the
long
winter
evening
with
her
,
and
her
only
,
was
to
quell
wholly
the
faint
excitement
wakened
by
my
walk
,
 
to
slip
again
over
my
faculties
the
viewless
fetters
of
an
uniform
and
too
still
existence
;
of
an
existence
whose
very
privileges
of
security
and
ease
I
was
becoming
incapable
of
appreciating
.
<EOS>
What
good
it
would
have
done
me
at
that
time
to
have
been
tossed
in
the
storms
of
an
uncertain
struggling
life
,
and
to
have
been
taught
by
rough
and
bitter
experience
to
long
for
the
calm
amidst
which
I
now
repined
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
just
as
much
good
as
it
would
do
a
man
tired
of
sitting
still
in
a
"
too
easy
chair
"
to
take
a
long
walk
<EOS>
:
and
just
as
natural
was
the
wish
to
stir
,
under
my
circumstances
,
as
it
would
be
under
his
.
  
<EOS>
I
lingered
at
the
gates
;
I
lingered
on
the
lawn
;
I
paced
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
pavement
;
the
shutters
of
the
glass
door
were
closed
;
I
could
not
see
into
the
interior
;
and
both
my
eyes
and
spirit
seemed
drawn
from
the
gloomy
house
 
from
the
grey
-
hollow
filled
with
rayless
cells
,
as
it
appeared
to
me
 
to
that
sky
expanded
before
me
,
 
a
blue
sea
absolved
from
taint
of
cloud
;
the
moon
ascending
it
in
solemn
march
;
her
orb
seeming
to
look
up
as
she
left
the
hill
-
tops
,
from
behind
which
she
had
come
,
far
and
farther
below
her
,
and
aspired
to
the
zenith
,
midnight
dark
in
its
fathomless
depth
and
measureless
distance
;
and
for
those
trembling
stars
that
followed
her
course
;
they
made
my
heart
tremble
,
my
veins
glow
when
I
viewed
them
.
<EOS>
Little
things
recall
us
to
earth
;
the
clock
struck
in
the
hall
;
that
sufficed
;
I
turned
from
moon
and
stars
,
opened
a
side-
door
,
and
went
in
.
  
<EOS>
The
hall
was
not
dark
,
nor
yet
was
it
lit
,
only
by
the
high
-
hung
bronze
lamp
;
a
warm
glow
suffused
both
it
and
the
lower
steps
of
the
oak
staircase
.
<EOS>
This
ruddy
shine
issued
from
the
great
dining
-
room
,
whose
two-
leaved
door
stood
open
,
and
showed
a
genial
fire
in
the
grate
,
glancing
on
marble
hearth
and
brass
fire
-
irons
,
and
revealing
purple
draperies
and
polished
furniture
,
in
the
most
pleasant
radiance
.
<EOS>
It
revealed
,
too
,
a
group
near
the
mantelpiece
:
<EOS>
I
had
scarcely
caught
it
,
and
scarcely
become
aware
of
a
cheerful
mingling
of
voices
,
amongst
which
I
seemed
to
distinguish
the
tones
of
Adele
,
when
the
door
closed
.
  
<EOS>
I
hastened
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
room
;
there
was
a
fire
there
too
,
but
no
candle
,
and
no
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
Instead
,
all
alone
,
sitting
upright
on
the
rug
,
and
gazing
with
gravity
at
the
blaze
,
I
beheld
a
great
black
and
white
long
-
haired
dog
,
just
like
the
Gytrash
of
the
lane
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
like
it
<EOS>
that
I
went
forward
and
said
 
"
Pilot
"
and
the
thing
got
up
and
came
to
me
and
snuffed
me
.
<EOS>
I
caressed
him
,
and
he
wagged
his
great
tail
;
but
he
looked
an
eerie
creature
to
be
alone
with
,
and
I
could
not
tell
whence
he
had
come
.
<EOS>
I
rang
the
bell
,
for
I
wanted
a
candle
;
and
I
wanted
,
too
,
to
get
an
account
of
this
visitant
.
<EOS>
Leah
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
dog
is
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
came
with
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
With
whom
?
"
  
"
With
master
 
Mr.
Rochester
 
<EOS>
he
is
just
arrived
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
and
is
Mrs.
Fairfax
with
him
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
Miss
Adele
;
they
are
in
the
dining
-
room
,
and
John
is
gone
for
a
surgeon
;
for
master
has
had
an
accident
;
his
horse
fell
and
his
ankle
is
sprained
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
the
horse
fall
in
Hay
Lane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
coming
down
-
hill
;
it
slipped
on
some
ice
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
Bring
me
a
candle
<EOS>
will
you
Leah
?
"
  
<EOS>
Leah
brought
it
;
she
entered
,
followed
by
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
who
repeated
the
news
;
adding
that
Mr.
Carter
the
surgeon
was
come
,
and
was
now
with
Mr.
Rochester
:
then
she
hurried
out
to
give
orders
about
tea
,
and
I
went
upstairs
to
take
off
my
things
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
,
it
seems
,
by
the
surgeon
's
orders
,
went
to
bed
early
that
night
;
nor
did
he
rise
soon
next
morning
.
<EOS>
When
he
did
come
down
,
it
was
to
attend
to
business
:
his
agent
and
some
of
his
tenants
were
arrived
,
and
waiting
to
speak
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
Adele
and
I
had
now
to
vacate
the
library
:
it
would
be
in
daily
requisition
as
a
reception
-
room
for
callers
.
<EOS>
A
fire
was
lit
in
an
apartment
upstairs
,
and
there
I
carried
our
books
,
and
arranged
it
for
the
future
schoolroom
.
<EOS>
I
discerned
in
the
course
of
the
morning
that
Thornfield
Hall
was
a
changed
place
:
no
longer
silent
as
a
church
<EOS>
,
it
echoed
every
hour
or
two
to
a
knock
at
the
door
,
or
a
clang
of
the
bell
;
steps
,
too
,
often
traversed
the
hall
,
and
new
voices
spoke
in
different
keys
below
;
a
rill
from
the
outer
world
was
flowing
through
it
;
it
had
a
master
:
for
my
part
,
I
liked
it
better
.
  
<EOS>
Adele
was
not
easy
to
teach
that
day
;
she
could
not
apply
:
she
kept
running
to
the
door
and
looking
over
the
banisters
to
see
if
she
could
get
a
glimpse
of
Mr.
Rochester
;
then
she
coined
pretexts
to
go
downstairs
,
in
order
,
as
I
shrewdly
suspected
,
to
visit
the
library
,
where
I
knew
she
was
not
wanted
;
then
,
when
I
got
a
little
angry
,
and
made
her
sit
still
,
she
continued
to
talk
incessantly
of
her
"
ami
,
Monsieur
Edouard
Fairfax
_
de
_
Rochester
,
"
as
she
dubbed
him
<EOS>
(
I
had
not
before
heard
his
prenomens
)
,
and
to
conjecture
what
presents
he
had
brought
her
:
for
it
appears
he
had
intimated
the
night
before
,
that
when
his
luggage
came
from
Millcote
,
there
would
be
found
amongst
it
a
little
box
in
whose
contents
she
had
an
interest
.
  
<EOS>
"
Et
cela
doit
signifier
,
"
said
she
,
"
qu'il
y
aura
<EOS>
la
dedans
<EOS>
un
cadeau
pour
moi
,
<EOS>
et
peut
-
etre
pour
vous
aussi
,
mademoiselle
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
a
parle
<EOS>
de
vous
:
<EOS>
il
m'a
demande
le
nom
de
ma
gouvernante
,
et
<EOS>
si
elle
<EOS>
n'etait
pas
une
petite
personne
,
assez
mince
et
un
peu
pale
.
<EOS>
J'ai
dit
qu'oui
:
<EOS>
car
c'est
vrai
,
n'est
-
ce
pas
,
mademoiselle
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
and
my
pupil
dined
as
usual
in
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
parlour
;
the
afternoon
was
wild
and
snowy
,
and
we
passed
it
in
the
schoolroom
.
<EOS>
At
dark
I
allowed
Adele
to
put
away
books
and
work
,
and
to
run
downstairs
;
for
,
from
the
comparative
silence
below
,
and
from
the
cessation
of
appeals
to
the
door
-
bell
,
I
conjectured
that
Mr.
Rochester
was
now
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
Left
alone
,
I
walked
to
the
window
;
but
nothing
was
to
be
seen
thence
:
<EOS>
twilight
and
snowflakes
together
thickened
the
air
,
and
hid
the
very
shrubs
on
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
I
let
down
the
curtain
and
went
back
to
the
fireside
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
clear
embers
I
was
tracing
a
view
,
not
unlike
a
picture
I
remembered
to
have
seen
of
the
castle
of
Heidelberg
,
on
the
Rhine
,
when
Mrs.
Fairfax
came
in
,
breaking
up
by
her
entrance
<EOS>
the
fiery
mosaic
I
had
been
piercing
together
,
and
scattering
too
some
heavy
unwelcome
thoughts
that
were
beginning
to
throng
on
my
solitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rochester
would
be
glad
if
you
and
your
pupil
would
take
tea
with
him
in
the
drawing
-
room
this
evening
,
"
said
she
:
"
he
has
been
so
much
engaged
all
day
that
he
could
not
ask
to
see
you
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
is
his
tea
-
time
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
at
six
o'clock
:
he
keeps
early
hours
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
change
your
frock
now
;
I
will
go
with
you
and
fasten
it
.
<EOS>
Here
is
a
candle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
necessary
to
change
my
frock
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
had
better
:
I
always
dress
for
the
evening
when
Mr.
Rochester
is
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
additional
ceremony
seemed
somewhat
stately
;
however
,
I
repaired
to
my
room
,
and
,
with
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
aid
,
replaced
my
black
stuff
dress
by
one
of
black
silk
;
the
best
and
the
only
additional
one
I
had
,
except
one
of
light
grey
,
which
,
in
my
Lowood
notions
of
the
toilette
,
I
thought
too
fine
to
be
worn
,
except
on
first
-
rate
occasions
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
a
brooch
,
"
said
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
single
little
pearl
ornament
which
Miss
Temple
gave
me
as
a
parting
keepsake
:
I
put
it
on
,
and
then
we
went
downstairs
.
<EOS>
Unused
as
I
was
to
strangers
,
it
was
rather
a
trial
to
appear
thus
formally
summoned
in
Mr.
Rochester
's
presence
.
<EOS>
I
let
Mrs.
Fairfax
precede
me
into
the
dining
-
room
,
and
kept
in
her
shade
as
we
crossed
that
apartment
;
and
,
passing
the
arch
,
whose
curtain
was
now
dropped
,
entered
the
elegant
recess
beyond
.
  
<EOS>
Two
wax
candles
stood
lighted
on
the
table
,
and
two
on
the
mantelpiece
;
basking
in
the
light
and
heat
of
a
superb
fire
,
lay
Pilot
 
Adele
knelt
near
him
.
<EOS>
Half
reclined
on
a
couch
appeared
Mr.
Rochester
,
his
foot
supported
by
the
cushion
;
he
was
looking
at
Adele
and
the
dog
:
<EOS>
the
fire
shone
full
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
I
knew
my
traveller
with
his
broad
and
jetty
eyebrows
;
his
square
forehead
,
made
squarer
by
the
horizontal
sweep
of
his
black
hair
.
<EOS>
I
recognised
his
decisive
nose
,
more
remarkable
for
character
than
beauty
;
his
full
nostrils
,
denoting
,
I
thought
,
choler
;
his
grim
mouth
,
chin
,
and
jaw
 
<EOS>
yes
,
all
three
were
very
grim
,
and
no
mistake
.
<EOS>
His
shape
,
now
divested
of
cloak
,
I
perceived
harmonised
in
squareness
with
his
physiognomy
:
I
suppose
it
was
a
good
figure
in
the
athletic
sense
of
the
term
 
broad
chested
and
thin
flanked
,
though
neither
tall
nor
graceful
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
must
have
been
aware
of
the
entrance
of
Mrs.
Fairfax
and
myself
;
but
it
appeared
he
was
not
in
the
mood
to
notice
us
,
for
he
never
lifted
his
head
as
we
approached
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
is
Miss
Eyre
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
in
her
quiet
way
.
<EOS>
He
bowed
,
still
not
taking
his
eyes
from
the
group
of
the
dog
and
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
Miss
Eyre
be
seated
,
"
said
he
:
<EOS>
and
there
was
something
in
the
forced
stiff
bow
,
in
the
impatient
yet
formal
tone
,
which
seemed
further
to
express
,
"
<EOS>
What
the
deuce
is
it
to
me
whether
Miss
Eyre
be
there
or
not
?
<EOS>
At
this
moment
I
am
not
disposed
to
accost
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
sat
down
quite
disembarrassed
.
<EOS>
A
reception
of
finished
politeness
would
probably
have
confused
me
:
I
could
not
have
returned
or
repaid
it
by
answering
grace
and
elegance
on
my
part
;
but
harsh
caprice
laid
me
under
no
obligation
;
on
the
contrary
,
a
decent
quiescence
,
under
the
freak
of
manner
,
gave
me
the
advantage
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
eccentricity
of
the
proceeding
was
piquant
:
I
felt
interested
to
see
how
he
would
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
on
as
a
statue
would
,
that
is
,
he
neither
spoke
nor
moved
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
seemed
to
think
it
necessary
that
some
one
should
be
amiable
,
and
she
began
to
talk
.
<EOS>
Kindly
,
as
usual
 
and
,
as
usual
,
rather
trite
 
<EOS>
she
condoled
with
him
on
the
pressure
of
business
<EOS>
he
had
had
all
day
;
on
the
annoyance
it
must
have
been
to
him
with
that
painful
sprain
:
then
she
commended
his
patience
and
perseverance
in
going
through
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
I
should
like
some
tea
,
"
was
the
sole
rejoinder
she
got
.
<EOS>
She
hastened
to
ring
the
bell
;
and
when
the
tray
came
,
she
proceeded
to
arrange
the
cups
,
spoons
,
&
c.
,
with
assiduous
celerity
.
<EOS>
I
and
Adele
went
to
the
table
;
but
the
master
did
not
leave
his
couch
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
hand
Mr.
Rochester
's
cup
?
"
said
Mrs.
Fairfax
to
me
;
"
Adele
might
perhaps
spill
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
as
requested
.
<EOS>
As
he
took
the
cup
from
my
hand
,
Adele
,
thinking
the
moment
propitious
for
making
a
request
in
my
favour
,
cried
out
    
"
N'est
-
ce
pas
,
monsieur
,
qu'il
y
a
un
cadeau
pour
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Eyre
dans
votre
petit
coffre
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
talks
of
cadeaux
?
"
said
he
gruffly
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
expect
a
present
,
Miss
Eyre
?
<EOS>
Are
you
fond
of
presents
?
"
<EOS>
and
he
searched
my
face
with
eyes
that
I
saw
were
dark
,
irate
,
and
piercing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
,
sir
;
I
have
little
experience
of
them
:
they
are
generally
thought
pleasant
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Generally
thought
?
<EOS>
But
what
do
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
obliged
to
take
time
,
sir
,
before
I
could
give
you
an
answer
worthy
of
your
acceptance
:
<EOS>
a
present
has
many
faces
to
it
,
has
it
not
?
<EOS>
and
one
should
consider
all
,
before
pronouncing
an
opinion
as
to
its
nature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Eyre
,
you
are
not
so
unsophisticated
as
Adele
:
she
demands
a
"
cadeau
,
"
clamorously
,
the
moment
she
sees
me
:
you
beat
about
the
bush
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
have
less
confidence
in
my
deserts
than
Adele
has
:
she
can
prefer
the
claim
of
old
acquaintance
,
and
the
right
too
of
custom
;
for
she
says
you
have
always
been
in
the
habit
of
giving
her
playthings
;
but
if
I
had
to
make
out
a
case
I
should
be
puzzled
,
since
I
am
a
stranger
,
and
have
done
nothing
to
entitle
me
to
an
acknowledgment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
fall
back
on
over
-
modesty
!
<EOS>
I
have
examined
Adele
,
and
find
you
have
taken
great
pains
with
her
:
she
is
not
bright
,
she
has
no
talents
;
yet
in
a
short
time
she
has
made
much
improvement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
you
have
now
given
me
my
"
cadeau
;
"
I
am
obliged
to
you
:
it
is
the
meed
teachers
most
covet
 
praise
of
their
pupils
'
progress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
said
Mr.
Rochester
,
and
he
took
his
tea
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
to
the
fire
,
"
said
the
master
,
when
the
tray
was
taken
away
,
and
Mrs.
Fairfax
had
settled
into
a
corner
with
her
knitting
;
while
Adele
was
leading
me
by
the
hand
round
the
room
,
showing
me
the
beautiful
books
and
ornaments
on
the
consoles
and
chiffonnieres
.
<EOS>
We
obeyed
,
as
in
duty
bound
;
Adele
wanted
to
take
a
seat
on
my
knee
,
but
she
was
ordered
to
amuse
herself
with
Pilot
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
resident
in
my
house
three
months
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
came
from
 
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
From
Lowood
school
,
in
shire
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
a
charitable
concern
.
<EOS>
How
long
were
you
there
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Eight
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Eight
years
!
<EOS>
you
must
be
tenacious
of
life
.
<EOS>
I
thought
half
the
time
in
such
a
place
would
have
done
up
any
constitution
!
<EOS>
No
wonder
you
have
rather
the
look
of
another
world
.
<EOS>
I
marvelled
where
you
had
got
that
sort
of
face
.
<EOS>
When
you
came
on
me
in
Hay
Lane
last
night
,
I
thought
unaccountably
of
fairy
tales
,
and
had
half
a
mind
to
demand
whether
you
had
bewitched
my
horse
:
I
am
not
sure
yet
.
<EOS>
Who
are
your
parents
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
none
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
ever
had
,
I
suppose
:
do
you
remember
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
not
.
<EOS>
And
so
you
were
waiting
for
your
people
when
you
sat
on
that
stile
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
For
whom
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
the
men
in
green
:
it
was
a
proper
moonlight
evening
for
them
.
<EOS>
Did
I
break
through
one
of
your
rings
,
that
you
spread
that
damned
ice
on
the
causeway
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
.
<EOS>
"
The
men
in
green
all
forsook
England
a
hundred
years
ago
,
"
said
I
,
speaking
as
seriously
as
he
had
done
.
"
<EOS>
And
not
even
in
Hay
Lane
,
or
the
fields
about
it
,
could
you
find
a
trace
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
either
summer
or
harvest
,
or
winter
moon
,
will
ever
shine
on
their
revels
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
had
dropped
her
knitting
,
and
,
with
raised
eyebrows
,
seemed
wondering
what
sort
of
talk
this
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
resumed
Mr.
Rochester
,
"
if
you
disown
parents
,
you
must
have
some
sort
of
kinsfolk
:
uncles
and
aunts
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
none
that
I
ever
saw
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
your
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
none
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
do
your
brothers
and
sisters
live
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
brothers
or
sisters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
recommended
you
to
come
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
advertised
,
and
Mrs.
Fairfax
answered
my
advertisement
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
good
lady
,
who
now
knew
what
ground
we
were
upon
,
"
and
I
am
daily
thankful
for
the
choice
Providence
led
me
to
make
.
<EOS>
Miss
Eyre
has
been
an
invaluable
companion
to
me
,
and
a
kind
and
careful
teacher
to
Adele
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
trouble
yourself
to
give
her
a
character
,
"
returned
Mr.
Rochester
:
"
eulogiums
will
not
bias
me
;
I
shall
judge
for
myself
.
<EOS>
She
began
by
felling
my
horse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
?
"
said
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
thank
her
for
this
sprain
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
widow
looked
bewildered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Eyre
,
have
you
ever
lived
in
a
town
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
seen
much
society
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
but
the
pupils
and
teachers
of
Lowood
,
and
now
the
inmates
of
Thornfield
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
read
much
?
"
  
"
Only
such
books
as
came
in
my
way
;
and
they
have
not
been
numerous
or
very
learned
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
lived
the
life
of
a
nun
:
<EOS>
no
doubt
you
are
well
drilled
in
religious
forms
;
 
Brocklehurst
,
who
I
understand
directs
Lowood
,
is
a
parson
,
is
he
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
girls
probably
worshipped
him
,
as
a
convent
full
of
religieuses
would
worship
their
director
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
cool
!
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
a
novice
not
worship
her
priest
!
<EOS>
That
sounds
blasphemous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
disliked
Mr.
Brocklehurst
;
and
I
was
not
alone
in
the
feeling
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
harsh
man
;
at
once
pompous
and
meddling
;
he
cut
off
our
hair
;
and
for
economy
's
sake
bought
us
bad
needles
and
thread
,
with
which
we
could
hardly
sew
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
very
false
economy
,
"
remarked
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
who
now
again
caught
the
drift
of
the
dialogue
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
was
that
the
head
and
front
of
his
offending
?
"
demanded
Mr.
Rochester
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
starved
us
when
he
had
the
sole
superintendence
of
the
provision
department
,
before
the
committee
was
appointed
;
and
he
bored
us
with
long
lectures
once
a
week
,
and
with
evening
readings
from
books
of
his
own
inditing
,
about
sudden
deaths
and
judgments
,
which
made
us
afraid
to
go
to
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
age
were
you
when
you
went
to
Lowood
?
"
  
"
About
ten
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
stayed
there
eight
years
:
you
are
now
,
then
,
eighteen
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
assented
.
  
<EOS>
"
Arithmetic
,
you
see
,
is
useful
;
without
its
aid
,
I
should
hardly
have
been
able
to
guess
your
age
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
point
difficult
to
fix
where
the
features
and
countenance
are
so
much
at
variance
as
in
your
case
.
<EOS>
And
now
what
did
you
learn
at
Lowood
?
<EOS>
Can
you
play
?
"
  
"
A
little
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
:
that
is
the
established
answer
.
<EOS>
Go
into
the
library
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
(
Excuse
my
tone
of
command
;
I
am
used
to
say
,
"
Do
this
,
"
and
it
is
done
:
I
can
not
alter
my
customary
habits
for
one
new
inmate
.
)
 
<EOS>
Go
,
then
,
into
the
library
;
take
a
candle
with
you
;
leave
the
door
open
;
sit
down
to
the
piano
,
and
play
a
tune
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
departed
,
obeying
his
directions
.
  
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
"
<EOS>
he
called
out
in
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
You
play
_
a
little
_
<EOS>
,
I
see
;
like
any
other
English
school
-
girl
;
perhaps
rather
better
than
some
,
but
not
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
closed
the
piano
and
returned
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
continued
 
<EOS>
"
Adele
showed
me
some
sketches
this
morning
,
which
she
said
were
yours
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
they
were
entirely
of
your
doing
;
probably
a
master
aided
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
!
"
I
interjected
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
that
pricks
pride
.
<EOS>
Well
,
fetch
me
your
portfolio
,
if
you
can
vouch
for
its
contents
being
original
;
but
do
n't
pass
your
word
unless
you
are
certain
:
I
can
recognise
patchwork
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
say
nothing
,
and
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
brought
the
portfolio
from
the
library
.
  
<EOS>
"
Approach
the
table
,
"
said
he
;
and
I
wheeled
it
to
his
couch
.
<EOS>
Adele
and
Mrs.
Fairfax
drew
near
to
see
the
pictures
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
crowding
,
"
said
Mr.
Rochester
:
"
take
the
drawings
from
my
hand
as
I
finish
with
them
;
but
do
n't
push
your
faces
up
to
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
deliberately
scrutinised
each
sketch
and
painting
.
<EOS>
Three
he
laid
aside
;
the
others
,
when
he
had
examined
them
,
he
swept
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
them
off
to
the
other
table
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
look
at
them
with
Adele
;
 
you
"
(
glancing
at
me
)
<EOS>
"
resume
your
seat
,
and
answer
my
questions
.
<EOS>
I
perceive
those
pictures
were
done
by
one
hand
:
was
that
hand
yours
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
did
you
find
time
to
do
them
?
<EOS>
They
have
taken
much
time
,
and
some
thought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
them
in
the
last
two
vacations
I
spent
at
Lowood
,
when
I
had
no
other
occupation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
did
you
get
your
copies
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Out
of
my
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
head
I
see
now
on
your
shoulders
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
it
other
furniture
of
the
same
kind
within
?
"
  
"
I
should
think
it
may
have
:
I
should
hope
 
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
spread
the
pictures
before
him
,
and
again
surveyed
them
alternately
.
  
<EOS>
While
he
is
so
occupied
,
I
will
tell
you
,
reader
,
what
they
are
:
and
first
<EOS>
,
I
must
premise
that
they
are
nothing
wonderful
.
<EOS>
The
subjects
had
,
indeed
,
risen
vividly
on
my
mind
.
<EOS>
As
I
saw
them
with
the
spiritual
eye
,
before
I
attempted
to
embody
them
,
they
were
striking
;
but
my
hand
would
not
second
my
fancy
,
and
in
each
case
it
had
wrought
out
but
a
pale
portrait
of
the
thing
I
had
conceived
.
  
<EOS>
These
pictures
were
in
water
-
colours
.
<EOS>
The
first
represented
clouds
low
and
livid
,
rolling
over
a
swollen
sea
:
all
the
distance
was
in
eclipse
;
so
,
too
,
was
the
foreground
;
or
rather
,
<EOS>
the
nearest
billows
,
for
there
was
no
land
.
<EOS>
One
gleam
of
light
lifted
into
relief
a
half
-
submerged
mast
,
on
which
sat
a
cormorant
,
dark
and
large
,
with
wings
flecked
with
foam
;
its
beak
held
a
gold
bracelet
set
with
gems
,
that
I
had
touched
with
as
brilliant
tints
as
my
palette
could
yield
,
and
as
glittering
distinctness
as
my
pencil
could
impart
.
<EOS>
Sinking
below
the
bird
and
mast
,
a
drowned
corpse
glanced
through
the
green
water
;
a
fair
arm
was
the
only
limb
clearly
visible
,
whence
the
bracelet
had
been
washed
or
torn
.
  
<EOS>
The
second
picture
contained
for
foreground
only
the
dim
peak
of
a
hill
,
with
grass
and
some
leaves
slanting
as
if
by
a
breeze
.
<EOS>
Beyond
and
above
spread
an
expanse
of
sky
,
dark
blue
as
at
twilight
:
rising
into
the
sky
was
a
woman
's
shape
to
the
bust
,
portrayed
in
tints
as
dusk
and
soft
as
I
could
combine
.
<EOS>
The
dim
forehead
was
crowned
with
a
star
;
the
lineaments
below
were
seen
as
through
the
suffusion
of
vapour
;
the
eyes
shone
dark
and
wild
;
the
hair
streamed
shadowy
,
like
a
beamless
cloud
torn
by
storm
or
by
electric
travail
.
<EOS>
On
the
neck
lay
a
pale
reflection
like
moonlight
;
the
same
faint
lustre
touched
the
train
of
thin
clouds
from
which
rose
and
bowed
this
vision
of
the
Evening
Star
.
  
<EOS>
The
third
showed
the
pinnacle
of
an
iceberg
piercing
a
polar
winter
sky
:
a
muster
of
northern
lights
reared
their
dim
lances
,
close
serried
,
along
the
horizon
.
<EOS>
Throwing
these
into
distance
,
rose
,
in
the
foreground
,
a
head
,
 
a
colossal
head
,
inclined
towards
the
iceberg
,
and
resting
against
it
.
<EOS>
Two
thin
hands
,
joined
under
the
forehead
,
and
supporting
it
,
drew
up
before
the
lower
features
a
sable
veil
,
<EOS>
a
brow
quite
bloodless
,
white
as
bone
,
and
an
eye
hollow
and
fixed
,
<EOS>
blank
of
meaning
but
for
the
glassiness
of
despair
,
alone
were
visible
.
<EOS>
Above
the
temples
,
amidst
wreathed
turban
folds
of
black
drapery
,
vague
in
its
character
and
consistency
as
cloud
,
gleamed
a
ring
of
white
flame
,
<EOS>
gemmed
with
sparkles
of
a
more
lurid
tinge
.
<EOS>
This
pale
crescent
was
"
the
likeness
of
a
kingly
crown
;
"
what
it
diademed
was
"
the
shape
which
shape
had
none
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Were
you
happy
when
you
painted
these
pictures
?
"
asked
Mr.
Rochester
presently
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
absorbed
,
sir
:
yes
,
and
I
was
happy
.
<EOS>
To
paint
them
,
in
short
,
was
to
enjoy
one
of
the
keenest
pleasures
I
have
ever
known
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
saying
much
.
<EOS>
Your
pleasures
,
by
your
own
account
,
have
been
few
;
but
I
daresay
you
did
exist
in
a
kind
of
artist
's
dreamland
while
you
blent
and
arranged
these
strange
tints
.
<EOS>
Did
you
sit
at
them
long
each
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
nothing
else
to
do
,
because
it
was
the
vacation
,
and
I
sat
at
them
from
morning
till
noon
,
and
from
noon
till
night
:
the
length
of
the
midsummer
days
favoured
my
inclination
to
apply
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
felt
self
-
satisfied
with
the
result
of
your
ardent
labours
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Far
from
it
.
<EOS>
I
was
tormented
by
the
contrast
between
my
idea
and
my
handiwork
:
in
each
case
I
had
imagined
something
which
I
was
quite
powerless
to
realise
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
<EOS>
:
you
have
secured
the
shadow
of
your
thought
;
but
no
more
,
probably
.
<EOS>
You
had
not
enough
of
the
artist
's
skill
and
science
to
give
it
full
being
:
yet
the
drawings
are
,
for
a
school
-
girl
,
peculiar
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
thoughts
,
they
are
elfish
.
<EOS>
These
eyes
in
the
Evening
Star
you
must
have
seen
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
How
could
you
make
them
look
so
clear
,
and
yet
not
at
all
brilliant
?
<EOS>
for
the
planet
above
quells
their
rays
.
<EOS>
And
what
meaning
is
that
in
their
solemn
depth
?
<EOS>
And
who
taught
you
to
paint
wind
?
<EOS>
There
is
a
high
gale
in
that
sky
,
and
on
this
hill
-
top
.
<EOS>
Where
did
you
see
Latmos
?
<EOS>
For
that
is
Latmos
.
<EOS>
There
!
put
the
drawings
away
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
scarce
tied
the
strings
of
the
portfolio
,
when
,
looking
at
his
watch
,
he
said
abruptly
    
"
<EOS>
It
is
nine
o'clock
:
what
are
you
about
,
Miss
Eyre
,
to
let
Adele
sit
up
so
long
?
<EOS>
Take
her
to
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adele
went
to
kiss
him
before
quitting
the
room
:
he
endured
the
caress
,
but
scarcely
seemed
to
relish
it
more
than
Pilot
would
have
done
,
nor
so
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
all
good
-
night
,
now
,
"
said
he
,
making
a
movement
of
the
hand
towards
the
door
,
in
token
that
he
was
tired
of
our
company
,
and
wished
to
dismiss
us
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
folded
up
her
knitting
:
I
took
my
portfolio
:
we
curtseyed
to
him
,
received
a
frigid
bow
in
return
,
and
so
withdrew
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
said
Mr.
Rochester
was
not
strikingly
peculiar
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
"
<EOS>
I
observed
,
when
I
rejoined
her
in
her
room
,
after
putting
Adele
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
:
he
is
very
changeful
and
abrupt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
:
no
doubt
he
may
appear
so
to
a
stranger
,
but
I
am
so
accustomed
to
his
manner
,
I
never
think
of
it
;
and
then
,
if
he
has
peculiarities
of
temper
,
allowance
should
be
made
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
  
"
Partly
because
it
is
his
nature
 
and
we
can
none
of
us
help
our
nature
;
and
partly
because
he
has
painful
thoughts
,
no
doubt
,
to
harass
him
,
and
make
his
spirits
unequal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
about
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Family
troubles
,
for
one
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
has
no
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
now
,
but
he
has
had
 
or
,
at
least
,
relatives
.
<EOS>
He
lost
his
elder
brother
a
few
years
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
_
elder
_
brother
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
The
present
Mr.
Rochester
has
not
been
very
long
in
possession
of
the
property
;
only
about
nine
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nine
years
is
a
tolerable
time
.
<EOS>
Was
he
so
very
fond
of
his
brother
as
to
be
still
inconsolable
for
his
loss
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
no
 
perhaps
not
.
<EOS>
I
believe
there
were
some
misunderstandings
between
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rowland
Rochester
was
not
quite
just
to
Mr.
Edward
;
and
perhaps
he
prejudiced
his
father
against
him
.
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
was
fond
of
money
,
and
anxious
to
keep
the
family
estate
together
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
like
to
diminish
the
property
by
division
,
and
yet
he
was
anxious
that
Mr.
Edward
should
have
wealth
,
too
,
to
keep
up
the
consequence
of
the
name
;
<EOS>
and
,
soon
after
he
was
of
age
,
some
steps
were
taken
that
were
not
quite
fair
,
and
made
a
great
deal
of
mischief
.
<EOS>
Old
Mr.
Rochester
and
Mr.
Rowland
combined
to
bring
Mr.
Edward
into
what
he
considered
a
painful
position
,
for
the
sake
of
making
his
fortune
:
what
the
precise
nature
of
that
position
was
I
never
clearly
knew
,
but
his
spirit
could
not
brook
what
he
had
to
suffer
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
very
forgiving
:
he
broke
with
his
family
,
and
now
for
many
years
he
has
led
an
unsettled
kind
of
life
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
he
has
ever
been
resident
at
Thornfield
for
a
fortnight
together
,
since
the
death
of
his
brother
without
a
will
left
him
master
of
the
estate
;
and
,
indeed
,
no
wonder
he
shuns
the
old
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
he
shun
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
thinks
it
gloomy
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
answer
was
evasive
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
liked
something
clearer
;
but
Mrs.
Fairfax
either
could
not
,
or
would
not
,
give
me
more
explicit
information
of
the
origin
and
nature
of
Mr.
Rochester
's
trials
.
<EOS>
She
averred
they
were
a
mystery
to
herself
,
and
that
what
she
knew
was
chiefly
from
conjecture
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
,
indeed
,
that
she
wished
me
to
drop
the
subject
,
which
I
did
accordingly
.
    
<EOS>
For
several
subsequent
days
I
saw
little
of
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
In
the
mornings
he
seemed
much
engaged
with
business
,
and
,
in
the
afternoon
,
gentlemen
from
Millcote
or
the
neighbourhood
called
,
and
sometimes
stayed
to
dine
with
him
.
<EOS>
When
his
sprain
was
well
enough
to
admit
of
horse
exercise
,
he
rode
out
a
good
deal
;
probably
to
return
these
visits
,
as
he
generally
did
not
come
back
till
late
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
During
this
interval
,
even
Adele
was
seldom
sent
for
to
his
presence
,
and
all
my
acquaintance
with
him
was
confined
to
an
occasional
rencontre
in
the
hall
,
on
the
stairs
,
or
in
the
gallery
,
when
he
would
sometimes
pass
me
haughtily
and
coldly
,
just
acknowledging
my
presence
by
a
distant
nod
or
a
cool
glance
,
and
sometimes
bow
and
smile
with
gentlemanlike
affability
.
<EOS>
His
changes
of
mood
did
not
offend
me
,
because
I
saw
that
I
had
nothing
to
do
with
their
alternation
;
the
ebb
and
flow
depended
on
causes
quite
disconnected
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
he
had
had
company
to
dinner
,
and
had
sent
for
my
portfolio
;
in
order
,
doubtless
,
to
exhibit
its
contents
:
the
gentlemen
went
away
early
,
to
attend
a
public
meeting
at
Millcote
,
as
Mrs.
Fairfax
informed
me
;
but
the
night
being
wet
and
inclement
,
Mr.
Rochester
did
not
accompany
them
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
they
were
gone
he
rang
the
bell
<EOS>
:
a
message
came
that
I
and
Adele
were
to
go
downstairs
.
<EOS>
I
brushed
Adele
's
hair
and
made
her
neat
,
and
having
ascertained
that
I
was
myself
in
my
usual
Quaker
trim
,
where
there
was
nothing
to
retouch
 
all
being
too
close
and
plain
,
braided
locks
included
,
to
admit
of
disarrangement
 
we
descended
,
Adele
wondering
whether
the
_
petit
coffre
_
was
at
length
come
;
for
,
owing
to
some
mistake
,
its
arrival
had
hitherto
been
delayed
.
<EOS>
She
was
gratified
:
there
it
stood
,
a
little
carton
,
on
the
table
when
we
entered
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
appeared
to
know
it
by
instinct
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ma
boite
!
<EOS>
ma
boite
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
she
,
running
towards
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
there
is
your
"
boite
"
at
last
:
take
it
into
a
corner
,
you
genuine
daughter
of
Paris
,
and
amuse
yourself
with
disembowelling
it
,
"
said
the
deep
and
rather
sarcastic
voice
of
Mr.
Rochester
,
proceeding
from
the
depths
of
an
immense
easy
-
chair
at
the
fireside
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
mind
,
"
he
continued
,
"
do
n't
bother
me
with
any
details
of
the
anatomical
process
,
or
any
notice
of
the
condition
of
the
entrails
:
let
your
operation
be
conducted
in
silence
:
<EOS>
tiens
-
toi
tranquille
,
enfant
<EOS>
;
comprends
-
tu
?
"
  
<EOS>
Adele
seemed
scarcely
to
need
the
warning
 
she
had
already
retired
to
a
sofa
with
her
treasure
,
and
was
busy
untying
the
cord
which
secured
the
lid
.
<EOS>
Having
removed
this
impediment
,
and
lifted
certain
silvery
envelopes
of
tissue
paper
,
she
merely
exclaimed
    
"
<EOS>
Oh
ciel
!
<EOS>
Que
c'est
beau
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
remained
absorbed
in
ecstatic
contemplation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Miss
Eyre
there
?
"
<EOS>
now
demanded
the
master
,
half
rising
from
his
seat
to
look
round
to
the
door
,
near
which
I
still
stood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
well
,
come
forward
;
be
seated
here
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
drew
a
chair
near
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
fond
of
the
prattle
of
children
,
"
he
continued
;
"
for
,
old
bachelor
as
I
am
,
I
have
no
pleasant
associations
connected
with
their
lisp
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
intolerable
to
me
to
pass
a
whole
evening
_
tete
-
a
-
tete
_
with
a
brat
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
draw
that
chair
farther
off
,
Miss
Eyre
;
sit
down
exactly
where
I
placed
it
 
if
you
please
,
that
is
.
<EOS>
Confound
these
civilities
!
<EOS>
I
continually
forget
them
.
<EOS>
Nor
do
I
particularly
affect
simple
-
minded
old
ladies
.
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
bye
,
I
must
have
mine
in
mind
;
it
wo
n't
do
to
neglect
her
;
she
is
a
Fairfax
,
or
we
d
to
one
;
and
blood
is
said
to
be
thicker
than
water
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
rang
,
and
despatched
an
invitation
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
who
soon
arrived
,
knitting
-
basket
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
evening
,
madam
;
I
sent
to
you
for
a
charitable
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
have
forbidden
Adele
to
talk
to
me
about
her
presents
,
and
she
is
bursting
with
repletion
:
have
the
goodness
to
serve
her
as
auditress
and
interlocutrice
;
it
will
be
one
of
the
most
benevolent
acts
you
ever
performed
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adele
,
indeed
,
no
sooner
saw
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
than
she
summoned
her
to
her
sofa
,
and
there
quickly
filled
her
lap
with
the
porcelain
,
the
ivory
,
the
waxen
contents
of
her
"
boite
;
"
pouring
out
,
meantime
,
explanations
and
raptures
in
such
broken
English
as
she
was
mistress
of
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
I
have
performed
the
part
of
a
good
host
,
"
pursued
Mr.
Rochester
,
"
put
my
guests
into
the
way
of
amusing
each
other
,
I
ought
to
be
at
liberty
to
attend
to
my
own
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Miss
Eyre
,
draw
your
chair
still
a
little
farther
forward
:
you
are
yet
too
far
back
;
I
can
not
see
you
without
disturbing
my
position
in
this
comfortable
chair
,
which
I
have
no
mind
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
as
I
was
bid
,
though
I
would
much
rather
have
remained
somewhat
in
the
shade
;
but
Mr.
Rochester
had
such
a
direct
way
of
giving
orders
<EOS>
,
it
seemed
a
matter
of
course
to
obey
him
promptly
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
,
as
I
have
said
,
in
the
dining
-
room
:
<EOS>
the
lustre
,
which
had
been
lit
for
dinner
,
filled
the
room
with
a
festal
breadth
of
light
;
the
large
fire
was
all
red
and
clear
;
the
purple
curtains
hung
rich
and
ample
before
the
lofty
window
and
loftier
arch
;
everything
was
still
,
save
the
subdued
chat
of
Adele
(
she
dared
not
speak
loud
)
,
and
,
filling
up
each
pause
,
the
beating
of
winter
rain
against
the
panes
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
,
as
he
sat
in
his
damask
-
covered
chair
,
looked
different
to
what
I
had
seen
him
look
before
;
not
quite
so
stern
 
much
less
gloomy
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
smile
on
his
lips
,
and
his
eyes
sparkled
,
whether
with
wine
or
not
,
I
am
not
sure
;
but
I
think
it
very
probable
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
in
short
,
in
his
after
-
dinner
mood
;
more
expanded
and
genial
,
and
also
more
self-
indulgent
than
the
frigid
and
rigid
temper
of
the
morning
;
still
he
looked
preciously
grim
,
cushioning
his
massive
head
against
the
swelling
back
of
his
chair
,
and
receiving
the
light
of
the
fire
on
his
granite-
hewn
features
,
and
in
his
great
,
dark
eyes
;
for
he
had
great
,
dark
eyes
,
and
very
fine
eyes
,
too
 
not
without
a
certain
change
in
their
depths
sometimes
,
which
,
if
it
was
not
softness
,
reminded
you
,
at
least
,
of
that
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
looking
two
minutes
at
the
fire
,
and
I
had
been
looking
the
same
length
of
time
at
him
,
when
,
turning
suddenly
,
he
caught
my
gaze
fastened
on
his
physiognomy
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
examine
me
,
Miss
Eyre
,
"
said
he
:
"
do
you
think
me
handsome
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
should
,
if
I
had
deliberated
,
have
replied
to
this
question
by
something
conventionally
vague
and
polite
;
but
the
answer
somehow
slipped
from
my
tongue
before
I
was
aware
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
By
my
word
!
<EOS>
there
is
something
singular
about
you
,
"
said
he
:
"
you
have
the
air
of
a
little
_
nonnette
_
;
quaint
,
quiet
,
grave
,
and
simple
,
as
you
sit
with
your
hands
before
you
,
and
your
eyes
generally
bent
on
the
carpet
(
except
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
when
they
are
directed
piercingly
to
my
face
;
as
just
now
,
for
instance
)
;
and
when
one
asks
you
a
question
,
or
makes
a
remark
to
which
you
are
obliged
to
reply
,
you
rap
out
a
round
rejoinder
,
which
,
if
not
blunt
,
is
at
least
brusque
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
by
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
was
too
plain
;
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
replied
that
it
was
not
easy
to
give
an
impromptu
answer
to
a
question
about
appearances
;
that
tastes
mostly
differ
;
and
that
beauty
is
of
little
consequence
,
or
something
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
have
replied
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
Beauty
of
little
consequence
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
And
so
,
under
pretence
of
softening
the
previous
outrage
,
of
stroking
and
soothing
me
into
placidity
,
you
stick
a
sly
penknife
under
my
ear
!
<EOS>
Go
on
<EOS>
:
what
fault
do
you
find
with
me
,
pray
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
have
all
my
limbs
and
all
my
features
like
any
other
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Rochester
,
allow
me
to
disown
my
first
answer
:
I
intended
no
pointed
repartee
:
it
was
only
a
blunder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
so
:
I
think
so
:
<EOS>
and
you
shall
be
answerable
for
it
.
<EOS>
Criticise
me
:
does
my
forehead
not
please
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
lifted
up
the
sable
waves
of
hair
which
lay
horizontally
over
his
brow
,
and
showed
a
solid
enough
mass
of
intellectual
organs
,
but
an
abrupt
deficiency
where
the
suave
sign
of
benevolence
should
have
risen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
ma'am
,
am
I
a
fool
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Far
from
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
You
would
,
perhaps
,
think
me
rude
if
I
inquired
in
return
whether
you
are
a
philanthropist
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
again
!
<EOS>
Another
stick
of
the
penknife
,
when
she
pretended
to
pat
my
head
:
and
that
is
because
I
said
I
did
not
like
the
society
of
children
and
old
women
<EOS>
(
low
be
it
spoken
!
)
.
<EOS>
No
,
young
lady
,
I
am
not
a
general
philanthropist
;
but
I
bear
a
conscience
;
"
and
he
pointed
to
the
prominences
which
are
said
to
indicate
that
faculty
,
and
which
,
fortunately
for
him
,
were
sufficiently
conspicuous
;
giving
,
indeed
,
a
marked
breadth
to
the
upper
part
of
his
head
:
"
and
,
besides
,
I
once
had
a
kind
of
rude
tenderness
of
heart
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
as
old
as
you
,
I
was
a
feeling
fellow
enough
,
partial
to
the
unfledged
,
unfostered
,
and
unlucky
;
but
Fortune
has
knocked
me
about
since
:
<EOS>
she
has
even
kneaded
me
with
her
knuckles
,
and
now
I
flatter
myself
<EOS>
I
am
hard
and
tough
as
an
India
-
rubber
ball
;
<EOS>
pervious
,
though
,
through
a
chink
or
two
still
,
and
with
one
sentient
point
in
the
middle
of
the
lump
.
<EOS>
Yes
:
does
that
leave
hope
for
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hope
of
what
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Of
my
final
re
-
transformation
from
India
-
rubber
back
to
flesh
?
"
  
"
Decidedly
he
has
had
too
much
wine
,
"
I
thought
;
and
I
did
not
know
what
answer
to
make
to
his
queer
question
:
how
could
I
tell
whether
he
was
capable
of
being
re
-
transformed
?
  
<EOS>
"
You
looked
very
much
puzzled
,
Miss
Eyre
;
and
though
you
are
not
pretty
any
more
than
I
am
handsome
,
yet
a
puzzled
air
becomes
you
;
besides
,
it
is
convenient
,
for
it
keeps
those
searching
eyes
of
yours
away
from
my
physiognomy
,
and
busies
them
with
the
worsted
flowers
of
the
rug
;
so
puzzle
on
.
<EOS>
Young
lady
,
I
am
disposed
to
be
gregarious
and
communicative
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
announcement
he
rose
from
his
chair
,
and
stood
,
leaning
his
arm
on
the
marble
mantelpiece
:
in
that
attitude
his
shape
was
seen
plainly
as
well
as
his
face
;
his
unusual
breadth
of
chest
,
disproportionate
almost
to
his
length
of
limb
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
most
people
would
have
thought
him
an
ugly
man
;
yet
there
was
so
much
unconscious
pride
in
his
port
;
so
much
ease
in
his
demeanour
;
such
a
look
of
complete
indifference
to
his
own
external
appearance
;
so
haughty
a
reliance
on
the
power
of
other
qualities
,
intrinsic
or
adventitious
,
to
atone
for
the
lack
of
mere
personal
attractiveness
,
that
,
in
looking
at
him
,
one
inevitably
shared
the
indifference
,
and
,
even
in
a
blind
,
imperfect
sense
,
put
faith
in
the
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
disposed
to
be
gregarious
and
communicative
to
-
night
,
"
he
repeated
,
"
and
that
is
why
I
sent
for
you
:
<EOS>
the
fire
and
the
chandelier
were
not
sufficient
company
for
me
;
nor
would
Pilot
have
been
,
for
none
of
these
can
talk
.
<EOS>
Adele
is
a
degree
better
,
but
still
far
below
the
mark
;
Mrs.
Fairfax
ditto
;
you
,
I
am
persuaded
,
can
suit
me
if
you
will
:
you
puzzled
me
the
first
evening
I
invited
you
down
here
.
<EOS>
I
have
almost
forgotten
you
since
:
other
ideas
have
driven
yours
from
my
head
;
but
to
-
night
I
am
resolved
to
be
at
ease
;
to
dismiss
what
importunes
,
and
recall
what
pleases
.
<EOS>
It
would
please
me
now
to
draw
you
out
 
to
learn
more
of
you
 
therefore
speak
.
"
  
<EOS>
Instead
of
speaking
,
I
smiled
;
and
not
a
very
complacent
or
submissive
smile
either
.
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
,
"
he
urged
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
about
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whatever
you
like
.
<EOS>
I
leave
both
the
choice
of
subject
and
the
manner
of
treating
it
entirely
to
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
I
sat
and
said
nothing
:
"
If
he
expects
me
to
talk
for
the
mere
sake
of
talking
and
showing
off
,
he
will
find
he
has
addressed
himself
to
the
wrong
person
,
"
I
thought
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
dumb
,
Miss
Eyre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
dumb
still
.
<EOS>
He
bent
his
head
a
little
towards
me
,
and
with
a
single
hasty
glance
seemed
to
dive
into
my
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stubborn
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
and
annoyed
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
it
is
consistent
.
<EOS>
I
put
my
request
in
an
absurd
,
almost
insolent
form
.
<EOS>
Miss
Eyre
,
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
once
for
all
,
I
do
n't
wish
to
treat
you
like
an
inferior
:
that
is
"
(
correcting
himself
)
,
"
I
claim
only
such
superiority
as
must
result
from
twenty
years
'
difference
in
age
and
a
century
's
advance
in
experience
.
<EOS>
This
is
legitimate
,
<EOS>
_
et
<EOS>
j'y
<EOS>
tiens
_
,
as
Adele
would
say
;
and
it
is
by
virtue
of
this
superiority
,
and
this
alone
,
that
I
desire
you
to
have
the
goodness
to
talk
to
me
a
little
now
,
and
divert
my
thoughts
,
which
are
galled
with
dwelling
on
one
point
 
cankering
as
a
rusty
nail
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
deigned
an
explanation
,
almost
an
apology
,
and
I
did
not
feel
insensible
to
his
condescension
,
and
would
not
seem
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
willing
to
amuse
you
,
if
I
can
,
sir
 
quite
willing
;
but
I
can
not
introduce
a
topic
,
because
how
do
I
know
what
will
interest
you
?
<EOS>
Ask
me
questions
,
and
I
will
do
my
best
to
answer
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
in
the
first
place
,
do
you
agree
with
me
that
I
have
a
right
to
be
a
little
masterful
,
abrupt
,
perhaps
exacting
,
sometimes
,
on
the
grounds
I
stated
,
namely
,
that
I
am
old
enough
to
be
your
father
,
and
that
I
have
battled
through
a
varied
experience
with
many
men
of
many
nations
,
and
roamed
over
half
the
globe
,
while
you
have
lived
quietly
with
one
set
of
people
in
one
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
as
you
please
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
no
answer
;
or
rather
it
is
a
very
irritating
,
because
a
very
evasive
one
.
<EOS>
Reply
clearly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
,
sir
,
you
have
a
right
to
command
me
,
merely
because
you
are
older
than
I
,
or
because
you
have
seen
more
of
the
world
than
I
have
;
your
claim
to
superiority
depends
on
the
use
you
have
made
of
your
time
and
experience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
<EOS>
Promptly
spoken
.
<EOS>
But
I
wo
n't
allow
that
,
seeing
that
it
would
never
suit
my
case
,
as
I
have
made
an
indifferent
,
not
to
say
a
bad
,
use
of
both
advantages
.
<EOS>
Leaving
superiority
out
of
the
question
,
then
,
you
must
still
agree
to
receive
my
orders
now
and
then
,
without
being
piqued
or
hurt
by
the
tone
of
command
.
<EOS>
Will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
smiled
:
I
thought
to
myself
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
_
is
_
peculiar
 
<EOS>
he
seems
to
forget
that
he
pays
me
30
pounds
per
annum
for
receiving
his
orders
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
smile
is
very
well
,
"
said
he
,
catching
instantly
the
passing
expression
;
"
but
speak
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
thinking
,
sir
,
that
very
few
masters
would
trouble
themselves
to
inquire
whether
or
not
their
paid
subordinates
were
piqued
and
hurt
by
their
orders
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Paid
subordinates
!
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
you
are
my
paid
subordinate
,
are
you
?
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
I
had
forgotten
the
salary
!
<EOS>
Well
then
,
on
that
mercenary
ground
,
will
you
agree
to
let
me
hector
a
little
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
not
on
that
ground
;
but
,
on
the
ground
that
you
did
forget
it
,
and
that
you
care
whether
or
not
a
dependent
is
comfortable
in
his
dependency
,
I
agree
heartily
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
will
you
consent
to
dispense
with
a
great
many
conventional
forms
and
phrases
,
without
thinking
that
the
omission
arises
from
insolence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
sir
,
I
should
never
mistake
informality
for
insolence
:
one
I
rather
like
,
the
other
nothing
free
-
born
would
submit
to
,
even
for
a
salary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Humbug
!
<EOS>
Most
things
free
-
born
will
submit
to
anything
for
a
salary
;
therefore
,
keep
to
yourself
,
and
do
n't
venture
on
generalities
of
which
you
are
intensely
ignorant
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
mentally
shake
hands
with
you
for
your
answer
,
despite
its
inaccuracy
;
and
as
much
for
the
manner
in
which
it
was
said
,
as
for
the
substance
of
the
speech
;
the
manner
was
frank
and
sincere
;
one
does
not
often
see
such
a
manner
:
<EOS>
no
,
on
the
contrary
,
affectation
,
or
coldness
,
or
stupid
,
coarse
-
minded
misapprehension
of
one
's
meaning
are
the
usual
rewards
of
candour
.
<EOS>
Not
three
in
three
thousand
raw
school
-
girl
-
governesses
would
have
answered
me
as
you
have
just
done
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
mean
to
flatter
you
:
if
you
are
cast
in
a
different
mould
to
the
majority
,
it
is
no
merit
of
yours
:
Nature
did
it
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
after
all
,
I
go
too
fast
in
my
conclusions
:
for
what
I
yet
know
,
you
may
be
no
better
than
the
rest
;
you
may
have
intolerable
defects
to
counterbalance
your
few
good
points
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
so
may
you
,
"
I
thought
.
<EOS>
My
eye
met
his
as
the
idea
crossed
my
mind
:
he
seemed
to
read
the
glance
,
answering
as
if
its
import
had
been
spoken
as
well
as
imagined
    
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
you
are
right
,
"
said
he
;
"
I
have
plenty
of
faults
of
my
own
:
I
know
it
,
and
I
do
n't
wish
to
palliate
them
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
God
wot
<EOS>
I
need
not
be
too
severe
about
others
;
I
have
a
past
existence
,
a
series
of
deeds
,
a
colour
of
life
to
contemplate
within
my
own
breast
,
which
might
well
call
my
sneers
and
censures
from
my
neighbours
to
myself
.
<EOS>
I
started
,
or
rather
(
for
like
other
defaulters
,
I
like
to
lay
half
the
blame
on
ill
fortune
and
adverse
circumstances
)
was
thrust
on
to
a
wrong
tack
at
the
age
of
one
-
and
-
twenty
,
and
have
never
recovered
the
right
course
since
:
<EOS>
but
I
might
have
been
very
different
;
I
might
have
been
as
good
as
you
 
wiser
 
almost
as
stainless
.
<EOS>
I
envy
you
your
peace
of
mind
,
<EOS>
your
clean
conscience
,
your
unpolluted
memory
.
<EOS>
Little
girl
,
a
memory
without
blot
or
contamination
must
be
an
exquisite
treasure
 
an
inexhaustible
source
of
pure
refreshment
:
is
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
was
your
memory
when
you
were
eighteen
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
right
then
;
limpid
,
salubrious
:
no
gush
of
bilge
water
had
turned
it
to
fetid
puddle
.
<EOS>
I
was
your
equal
at
eighteen
 
quite
your
equal
.
<EOS>
Nature
meant
me
to
be
,
on
the
whole
,
a
good
man
,
Miss
Eyre
;
one
of
the
better
kind
,
<EOS>
and
you
see
I
am
not
so
.
<EOS>
You
would
say
you
do
n't
see
it
;
at
least
I
flatter
myself
I
read
as
much
in
your
eye
(
beware
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
<EOS>
what
you
express
with
that
organ
;
I
am
quick
at
interpreting
its
language
)
.
<EOS>
Then
take
my
word
for
it
,
 
I
am
not
a
villain
:
you
are
not
to
suppose
that
 
not
to
attribute
to
me
any
such
bad
eminence
;
but
,
owing
,
I
verily
believe
,
rather
to
circumstances
than
to
my
natural
bent
,
I
am
a
trite
commonplace
sinner
,
hackneyed
in
all
the
poor
petty
dissipations
with
which
the
rich
and
worthless
try
to
put
on
life
.
<EOS>
Do
you
wonder
that
I
avow
this
to
you
?
<EOS>
Know
,
that
in
the
course
of
your
future
life
you
will
often
find
yourself
elected
the
involuntary
confidant
of
your
acquaintances
'
secrets
:
<EOS>
people
will
instinctively
find
out
,
as
I
have
done
,
that
it
is
not
your
forte
to
tell
of
yourself
,
but
to
listen
while
others
talk
of
themselves
;
they
will
feel
,
too
,
that
you
listen
with
no
malevolent
scorn
of
their
indiscretion
,
but
with
a
kind
of
innate
sympathy
;
not
the
less
comforting
and
encouraging
because
it
is
very
unobtrusive
in
its
manifestations
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
?
 
<EOS>
how
can
you
guess
all
this
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
well
;
therefore
I
proceed
almost
as
freely
as
if
I
were
writing
my
thoughts
in
a
diary
.
<EOS>
You
would
say
,
I
should
have
been
superior
to
circumstances
;
so
I
should
 
<EOS>
so
I
should
;
<EOS>
but
you
see
I
was
not
.
<EOS>
When
fate
wronged
me
,
I
had
not
the
wisdom
to
remain
cool
:
<EOS>
I
turned
desperate
;
then
I
degenerated
.
<EOS>
Now
,
when
any
vicious
simpleton
excites
my
disgust
by
his
paltry
ribaldry
,
I
can
not
flatter
myself
that
I
am
better
than
he
<EOS>
:
I
am
forced
to
confess
that
he
and
I
are
on
a
level
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
stood
firm
 
<EOS>
God
knows
I
do
!
<EOS>
Dread
remorse
when
you
are
tempted
to
err
,
Miss
Eyre
;
remorse
is
the
poison
of
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Repentance
is
said
to
be
its
cure
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
its
cure
.
<EOS>
Reformation
may
be
its
cure
;
and
I
could
reform
 
<EOS>
I
have
strength
yet
for
that
 
<EOS>
if
 
but
where
is
the
use
of
thinking
of
it
,
hampered
,
burdened
,
cursed
as
I
am
?
<EOS>
Besides
,
since
happiness
is
irrevocably
denied
me
,
I
have
a
right
to
get
pleasure
out
of
life
:
and
I
_
will
_
get
it
,
cost
what
it
may
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
will
degenerate
still
more
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Possibly
:
yet
why
should
I
,
if
I
can
get
sweet
,
fresh
pleasure
?
<EOS>
And
I
may
get
it
as
sweet
and
fresh
as
the
wild
honey
the
bee
gathers
on
the
moor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
sting
 
it
will
taste
bitter
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
?
 
<EOS>
you
never
tried
it
.
<EOS>
How
very
serious
 
how
very
solemn
you
look
:
and
you
are
as
ignorant
of
the
matter
as
this
cameo
head
"
(
taking
one
from
the
mantelpiece
)
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
right
to
preach
to
me
,
you
neophyte
,
that
have
not
passed
the
porch
of
life

and
are
absolutely
unacquainted
with
its
mysteries

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
remind
you
of
your
own
words
,
sir

<EOS>
you
said
error
brought
remorse
,
and
you
pronounced
remorse
the
poison
of
existence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
talks
of
error
now
?
<EOS>
I
scarcely
think
the
notion
that
flittered
across
my
brain
was
an
error
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
was
an
inspiration
rather
than
a
temptation
:
it
was
very
genial
,
very
soothing
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
.
<EOS>
Here
it
comes
again
!
<EOS>
It
is
no
devil
,
I
assure
you
;
or
if
it
be
,
it
has
put
on
the
robes
of
an
angel
of
light
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
must
admit
so
fair
a
guest
when
it
asks
entrance
to
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Distrust
it
,
sir
;
it
is
not
a
true
angel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Once
more
,
how
do
you
know
?
<EOS>
By
what
instinct
do
you
pretend
to
distinguish
between
a
fallen
seraph
of
the
abyss
and
a
messenger
from
the
eternal
throne
 
between
a
guide
and
a
seducer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
judged
by
your
countenance
,
sir
,
which
was
troubled
when
you
said
the
suggestion
had
returned
upon
you
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
it
will
work
you
more
misery
if
you
listen
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
 
it
bears
the
most
gracious
message
in
the
world
:
for
the
rest

you
are
not
my
conscience

keeper

so
do
n't
make
yourself
uneasy

Here

come
in

bonny
wanderer

<EOS>
He
said
this
as
if
he
spoke
to
a
vision
,
viewless
to
any
eye
but
his
own
;
then
,
folding
his
arms
,
which
he
had
half
extended
,
on
his
chest
,
he
seemed
to
enclose
in
their
embrace
the
invisible
being
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
he
continued
,
again
addressing
me
,
"
I
have
received
the
pilgrim
 
<EOS>
a
disguised
deity
,
as
I
verily
believe
.
<EOS>
Already
it
has
done
me
good
<EOS>
:
my
heart
was
a
sort
of
charnel
;
it
will
now
be
a
shrine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
speak
truth
,
sir
,
I
do
n't
understand
you
at
all
:
I
can
not
keep
up
the
conversation
,
because
it
has
got
out
of
my
depth
.
<EOS>
Only
one
thing
,
I
know
:
you
said
you
were
not
as
good
as
you
should
like
to
be
,
and
that
you
regretted
your
own
imperfection
;
 
<EOS>
one
thing
I
can
comprehend
:
you
intimated
that
to
have
a
sullied
memory
was
a
perpetual
bane
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
,
that
if
you
tried
hard
,
you
would
in
time
find
it
possible
to
become
what
you
yourself
would
approve
;
and
that
if
from
this
day
you
began
with
resolution
to
correct
your
thoughts
and
actions
,
you
would
in
a
few
years
have
laid
up
a
new
and
stainless
store
of
recollections
,
to
which
you
might
revert
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Justly
thought
;
rightly
said
,
Miss
Eyre
;
and
,
at
this
moment
,
I
am
paving
hell
with
energy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
laying
down
good
intentions
,
which
I
believe
durable
as
flint
.
<EOS>
Certainly
,
my
associates
and
pursuits
shall
be
other
than
they
have
been
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
better
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
better
 
so
much
better
as
pure
ore
is
than
foul
dross
.
<EOS>
You
seem
to
doubt
me
;
I
do
n't
doubt
myself
:
<EOS>
I
know
what
my
aim
is
,
what
my
motives
are
;
and
at
this
moment
I
pass
a
law
,
unalterable
as
that
of
the
Medes
and
Persians
,
that
both
are
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
can
not
be
,
sir
,
if
they
require
a
new
statute
to
legalise
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
,
Miss
Eyre
,
though
they
absolutely
require
a
new
statute
:
unheard
-
of
combinations
of
circumstances
demand
unheard
-
of
rules
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
sounds
a
dangerous
maxim
,
sir
;
because
one
can
see
at
once
that
it
is
liable
to
abuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sententious
sage
!
<EOS>
so
it
is
:
<EOS>
but
I
swear
by
my
household
gods
not
to
abuse
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
human
and
fallible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
:
so
are
you
 
what
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
human
and
fallible
should
not
arrogate
a
power
with
which
the
divine
and
perfect
alone
can
be
safely
intrusted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
power
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
That
of
saying
of
any
strange
,
unsanctioned
line
of
action
,
 
"
Let
it
be
right
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
Let
it
be
right
'
 
the
very
words
:
you
have
pronounced
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
May
_
it
be
right
then
,
"
I
said
,
as
I
rose
,
deeming
it
useless
to
continue
a
discourse
which
was
all
darkness
to
me
;
and
,
besides
,
sensible
that
the
character
of
my
interlocutor
was
beyond
my
penetration
;
at
least
,
beyond
its
present
reach
;
and
feeling
the
uncertainty
,
the
vague
sense
of
insecurity
,
which
accompanies
a
conviction
of
ignorance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
put
Adele
to
bed
:
it
is
past
her
bedtime
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
afraid
of
me
,
because
I
talk
like
a
Sphynx
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
language
is
enigmatical
,
sir
:
but
though
I
am
bewildered
,
I
am
certainly
not
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
_
are
_
<EOS>
afraid
 
<EOS>
your
self
-
love
dreads
a
blunder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
that
sense
I
do
feel
apprehensive
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
wish
to
talk
nonsense
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
did
,
it
would
be
in
such
a
grave
,
quiet
manner
,
I
should
mistake
it
for
sense
.
<EOS>
Do
you
never
laugh
,
Miss
Eyre
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
trouble
yourself
to
answer
 
<EOS>
I
see
you
laugh
rarely
;
but
you
can
laugh
very
merrily
<EOS>
:
believe
me
,
you
are
not
naturally
austere
,
any
more
than
I
am
naturally
vicious
.
<EOS>
The
Lowood
constraint
still
clings
to
you
somewhat
;
controlling
your
features
,
muffling
your
voice
,
and
restricting
your
limbs
;
and
you
fear
in
the
presence
of
a
man
and
a
brother
 
or
father
,
or
master
,
or
what
you
will
 
to
smile
too
gaily
,
speak
too
freely
,
or
move
too
quickly
:
but
,
in
time
,
I
think
you
will
learn
to
be
natural
with
me
,
as
I
find
it
impossible
to
be
conventional
with
you
;
and
then
your
looks
and
movements
will
have
more
vivacity
and
variety
than
they
dare
offer
now
.
<EOS>
I
see
at
intervals
the
glance
of
a
curious
sort
of
bird
through
the
close
-
set
bars
of
a
cage
:
a
vivid
,
restless
,
resolute
captive
is
there
;
were
it
but
<EOS>
free
,
it
would
soar
cloud
-
high
.
<EOS>
You
are
still
bent
on
going
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
struck
nine
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
 
wait
a
minute
:
Adele
is
not
ready
to
go
to
bed
yet
.
<EOS>
My
position
,
Miss
Eyre
,
with
my
back
to
the
fire
,
and
my
face
to
the
room
,
favours
observation
.
<EOS>
While
talking
to
you
,
I
have
also
occasionally
watched
Adele
(
I
have
my
own
reasons
for
thinking
her
a
curious
study
,
 
reasons
that
I
may
,
nay
,
that
I
shall
,
impart
to
you
some
day
)
.
<EOS>
She
pulled
out
of
her
box
,
about
ten
minutes
ago
,
a
little
pink
silk
frock
;
rapture
lit
her
face
as
she
unfolded
it
;
coquetry
runs
in
her
blood
,
blends
with
her
brains
,
and
seasons
the
marrow
of
her
bones
.
"
<EOS>
Il
faut
que
je
l'essaie
!
"
<EOS>
cried
she
,
"
<EOS>
et
a
l'instant
meme
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
is
now
with
Sophie
,
undergoing
a
robing
process
:
in
a
few
minutes
she
will
re
-
enter
;
and
I
know
what
I
shall
see
,
 
a
miniature
of
Celine
Varens
,
as
she
used
to
appear
on
the
boards
at
the
rising
of
 
But
never
mind
that
.
<EOS>
However
,
my
tenderest
feelings
are
about
to
receive
a
shock
:
such
is
my
presentiment
;
stay
now
,
to
see
whether
it
will
be
realised
.
"
  
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
Adele
's
little
foot
was
heard
tripping
across
the
hall
.
<EOS>
She
entered
,
transformed
as
her
guardian
had
predicted
.
<EOS>
A
dress
of
rose
-
coloured
satin
,
very
short
,
and
as
full
in
the
skirt
as
it
could
be
gathered
,
replaced
the
brown
frock
she
had
previously
worn
;
a
wreath
of
rosebuds
circled
her
forehead
;
her
feet
were
dressed
in
silk
stockings
and
small
white
satin
sandals
.
  
<EOS>
"
Est
-
ce
que
ma
robe
va
bien
?
"
cried
she
,
bounding
forwards
;
"
et
<EOS>
mes
souliers
?
<EOS>
et
mes
bas
?
<EOS>
Tenez
,
je
crois
que
je
vais
danser
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
spreading
out
her
dress
,
she
chasseed
across
the
room
till
,
having
reached
Mr.
Rochester
,
she
wheeled
lightly
round
before
him
on
tip
-
toe
,
then
dropped
on
one
knee
at
his
feet
,
exclaiming
    
"
Monsieur
,
je
vous
remercie
mille
fois
de
votre
bonte
;
"
then
rising
,
she
added
,
"
<EOS>
C'est
comme
cela
que
maman
faisait
,
n'est
-
ce
pas
,
monsieur
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pre
-
cise
-
ly
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
answer
;
"
and
,
"
comme
cela
,
"
she
charmed
my
English
gold
out
of
my
British
breeches
'
pocket
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
green
,
too
,
Miss
Eyre
,
 
ay
,
grass
green
:
not
a
more
vernal
tint
freshens
you
now
than
once
freshened
me
.
<EOS>
My
Spring
is
gone
,
however
,
but
it
has
left
me
that
French
floweret
on
my
hands
,
which
,
in
some
moods
,
I
would
fain
be
rid
of
.
<EOS>
Not
valuing
now
the
root
whence
it
sprang
;
having
found
that
it
was
of
a
sort
which
nothing
but
gold
dust
could
manure
,
<EOS>
I
have
but
<EOS>
half
a
liking
to
the
blossom
,
especially
when
it
looks
so
artificial
as
just
now
.
<EOS>
I
keep
it
and
rear
it
rather
on
the
Roman
Catholic
principle
of
expiating
numerous
sins
,
great
or
small
,
by
one
good
work
.
<EOS>
I
'll
explain
all
this
some
day
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
did
,
on
a
future
occasion
,
explain
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
afternoon
,
when
he
chanced
to
meet
me
and
Adele
in
the
grounds
:
and
while
she
played
with
Pilot
and
her
shuttlecock
,
he
asked
me
to
walk
up
and
down
a
long
beech
avenue
within
sight
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
said
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
French
opera
-
dancer
,
Celine
Varens
,
towards
whom
he
had
once
cherished
what
he
called
a
"
_
grande
passion
_
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
passion
Celine
had
professed
to
return
with
even
superior
ardour
.
<EOS>
He
thought
himself
her
idol
,
ugly
as
he
was
:
he
believed
,
as
he
said
,
that
she
preferred
his
"
_
taille
d'athlete
_
"
to
the
elegance
of
the
Apollo
Belvidere
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
,
Miss
Eyre
,
so
much
was
I
flattered
by
this
preference
of
the
Gallic
sylph
for
her
British
gnome
,
that
I
installed
her
in
an
hotel
;
gave
her
a
complete
establishment
of
servants
,
a
carriage
,
cashmeres
,
diamonds
,
dentelles
,
&
c.
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
began
the
process
of
ruining
myself
in
the
received
style
,
like
any
other
spoony
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
,
it
seems
,
the
originality
to
chalk
out
a
new
road
to
shame
and
destruction
,
but
trode
the
old
track
with
stupid
exactness
not
to
deviate
an
inch
from
the
beaten
centre
.
<EOS>
I
had
 
as
I
deserved
to
have
 
the
fate
of
all
other
spoonies
.
<EOS>
Happening
to
call
one
evening
when
Celine
did
not
expect
me
,
I
found
her
out
;
but
it
was
a
warm
night
,
and
I
was
tired
with
strolling
through
Paris
,
so
I
sat
down
in
her
boudoir
;
happy
to
breathe
the
air
consecrated
so
lately
by
her
presence
.
<EOS>
No
,
 
I
exaggerate
;
I
never
thought
there
was
any
consecrating
virtue
about
her
:
<EOS>
it
was
rather
a
sort
of
pastille
perfume
she
had
left
;
a
scent
of
musk
and
amber
,
than
an
odour
of
sanctity
.
<EOS>
I
was
just
beginning
to
stifle
with
the
fumes
of
conservatory
flowers
and
sprinkled
essences
,
when
I
bethought
myself
to
open
the
window
and
step
out
on
to
the
balcony
.
<EOS>
It
was
moonlight
and
gaslight
besides
,
and
very
still
and
serene
.
<EOS>
The
balcony
was
furnished
with
a
chair
or
two
;
I
sat
down
,
and
took
out
a
cigar
,
 
I
will
take
one
now
,
if
you
will
excuse
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
ensued
a
pause
,
filled
up
by
the
producing
and
lighting
of
a
cigar
;
having
placed
it
to
his
lips
and
breathed
a
trail
of
Havannah
incense
on
the
freezing
and
sunless
air
,
he
went
on
    
"
<EOS>
I
liked
bonbons
too
in
those
days
,
Miss
Eyre
,
and
I
was
_
croquant
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
(
overlook
the
barbarism
)
 
<EOS>
_
croquant
_
chocolate
comfits
,
and
smoking
alternately
,
watching
meantime
the
equipages
that
rolled
along
the
fashionable
streets
towards
the
neighbouring
opera
-
house
<EOS>
,
when
in
an
elegant
close
carriage
drawn
by
a
beautiful
pair
of
English
horses
,
and
distinctly
seen
in
the
brilliant
city
-
night
,
I
recognised
the
"
voiture
"
I
had
given
Celine
.
<EOS>
She
was
returning
:
<EOS>
of
course
my
heart
thumped
with
impatience
against
the
iron
rails
I
leant
upon
.
<EOS>
The
carriage
stopped
,
as
I
had
expected
,
at
the
hotel
door
;
my
flame
(
that
is
the
very
word
for
an
opera
inamorata
)
alighted
:
though
muffed
in
a
cloak
 
an
unnecessary
encumbrance
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
on
so
warm
<EOS>
a
June
evening
 
<EOS>
I
knew
her
instantly
by
her
little
foot
,
<EOS>
seen
peeping
from
the
skirt
of
her
dress
,
as
she
skipped
from
the
carriage
-
step
.
<EOS>
Bending
over
the
balcony
,
I
was
about
to
murmur
"
Mon
ange
"
 
in
a
tone
,
of
course
,
which
should
be
audible
to
the
ear
of
love
alone
 
when
a
figure
jumped
from
the
carriage
after
her
;
cloaked
also
;
but
that
was
a
spurred
heel
which
had
rung
on
the
pavement
,
and
that
was
a
hatted
head
which
now
passed
under
the
arched
_
<EOS>
porte
cochere
_
of
the
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
felt
jealousy
,
did
you
,
Miss
Eyre
?
<EOS>
Of
course
not
:
I
need
not
ask
you
;
because
you
never
felt
love
.
<EOS>
You
have
both
sentiments
yet
to
experience
:
your
soul
sleeps
;
the
shock
is
yet
to
be
given
which
shall
waken
it
.
<EOS>
You
think
all
existence
lapses
in
as
quiet
a
flow
as
that
in
which
your
youth
has
hitherto
slid
away
.
<EOS>
Floating
on
with
closed
eyes
and
muffled
ears
,
you
neither
see
the
rocks
bristling
not
far
off
in
the
bed
of
the
flood
,
nor
hear
the
breakers
boil
at
their
base
.
<EOS>
But
I
tell
you
 
and
you
may
mark
my
words
 
<EOS>
you
will
come
some
day
to
a
craggy
pass
in
the
channel
,
where
the
whole
of
life
's
stream
will
be
broken
up
into
whirl
and
tumult
,
foam
and
noise
:
either
you
will
be
dashed
to
atoms
on
crag
points
,
or
lifted
up
and
borne
on
by
some
master
-
wave
into
a
calmer
current
 
as
I
am
now

"
I
like
this
day
;
I
like
that
sky
of
steel
;
I
like
the
sternness
and
stillness
of
the
world
under
this
frost
.
<EOS>
I
like
Thornfield
,
its
antiquity
,
its
retirement
,
its
old
crow
-
trees
and
thorn
-
trees
,
its
grey
facade
,
and
lines
of
dark
windows
reflecting
that
metal
welkin
:
<EOS>
and
yet
how
long
have
I
abhorred
the
very
thought
of
it
,
shunned
it
like
a
great
plague
-
house
?
<EOS>
How
I
do
still
abhor
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
ground
his
teeth
and
was
silent
:
he
arrested
his
step
and
struck
his
boot
against
the
hard
ground
.
<EOS>
Some
hated
thought
seemed
to
have
him
in
its
grip
,
and
to
hold
him
so
tightly
that
he
could
not
advance
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
ascending
the
avenue
when
he
thus
paused
;
the
hall
was
before
us
.
<EOS>
Lifting
his
eye
to
its
battlements
,
he
cast
over
them
a
glare
such
as
<EOS>
I
never
saw
before
or
since
.
<EOS>
Pain
,
shame
,
ire
,
impatience
,
disgust
,
detestation
,
seemed
momentarily
to
hold
a
quivering
conflict
in
the
large
pupil
dilating
under
his
ebon
eyebrow
.
<EOS>
Wild
was
the
wrestle
which
should
be
paramount
;
but
another
feeling
rose
and
triumphed
:
<EOS>
something
hard
and
cynical
:
self
-
willed
and
resolute
<EOS>
:
it
settled
his
passion
and
petrified
his
countenance
:
he
went
on
    
"
<EOS>
During
the
moment
I
was
silent
,
Miss
Eyre
,
I
was
arranging
a
point
with
my
destiny
.
<EOS>
She
stood
there
,
by
that
beech
-
trunk
 
<EOS>
a
hag
like
one
of
those
who
appeared
to
Macbeth
on
the
heath
of
Forres
.
<EOS>
"
You
like
Thornfield
?
"
she
said
,
lifting
her
finger
;
and
then
she
wrote
in
the
air
a
memento
,
which
ran
in
lurid
hieroglyphics
all
along
the
house
-
front
,
between
the
upper
and
lower
row
of
windows
,
"
Like
it
if
you
can
!
<EOS>
Like
it
if
you
dare
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
will
like
it
,
"
said
I
;
"
I
dare
like
it
;
"
and
"
(
he
subjoined
moodily
)
"
<EOS>
I
will
keep
my
word
;
I
will
break
obstacles
to
happiness
,
to
goodness
 
<EOS>
yes
,
goodness
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
be
a
better
man
than
I
have
been
,
than
I
am
;
as
Job
's
leviathan
broke
the
spear
,
the
dart
,
and
the
habergeon
,
hindrances
which
others
count
as
iron
and
brass
,
I
will
esteem
but
straw
and
rotten
wood
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adele
here
ran
before
him
with
her
shuttlecock
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Away
!
"
he
cried
harshly
;
"
keep
at
a
distance
,
child
;
or
go
in
to
Sophie
!
"
<EOS>
Continuing
then
to
pursue
his
walk
in
silence
,
I
ventured
to
recall
him
to
the
point
<EOS>
whence
he
had
abruptly
diverged
    
<EOS>
"
Did
you
leave
the
balcony
,
sir
,
"
I
asked
,
"
when
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Varens
entered
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
almost
expected
a
rebuff
for
this
hardly
well
-
timed
question
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
waking
out
of
his
scowling
abstraction
,
he
turned
his
eyes
towards
me
,
and
the
shade
seemed
to
clear
off
his
brow
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
had
forgotten
Celine
!
<EOS>
Well
,
to
resume
.
<EOS>
When
I
saw
my
charmer
thus
come
in
accompanied
by
a
cavalier
,
I
seemed
to
hear
a
hiss
,
and
the
green
snake
of
jealousy
,
rising
on
undulating
coils
from
the
moonlit
balcony
,
glided
within
my
waistcoat
,
and
ate
its
way
in
two
minutes
to
my
heart
's
core
.
<EOS>
Strange
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
suddenly
starting
again
from
the
point
.
<EOS>
"
Strange
that
I
should
choose
you
for
the
confidant
of
all
this
,
young
lady
;
passing
strange
that
you
should
listen
to
me
quietly
,
as
if
it
were
the
most
usual
thing
in
the
world
for
a
man
like
me
to
tell
stories
of
his
opera
-
mistresses
to
a
quaint
,
inexperienced
girl
like
you
!
<EOS>
But
the
last
singularity
explains
the
first
,
as
I
intimated
once
before
:
you
,
with
your
gravity
,
considerateness
,
and
caution
were
made
to
be
the
recipient
of
secrets
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
know
what
sort
of
a
mind
I
have
placed
in
communication
with
my
own
:
I
know
it
is
one
not
liable
to
take
infection
<EOS>
:
it
is
a
peculiar
mind
:
it
is
a
unique
one
.
<EOS>
Happily
I
do
not
mean
to
harm
it
:
<EOS>
but
,
if
I
did
,
it
would
not
take
harm
from
me
.
<EOS>
The
more
you
and
I
converse
,
the
better
;
for
while
I
can
not
blight
you
,
you
may
refresh
me
.
"
<EOS>
After
this
digression
he
proceeded
    
<EOS>
"
I
remained
in
the
balcony
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
come
to
her
boudoir
,
no
doubt
,
"
thought
I
:
"
let
me
prepare
an
ambush
.
"
<EOS>
So
putting
my
hand
in
through
the
open
window
,
I
drew
the
curtain
over
it
,
leaving
only
an
opening
through
which
I
could
take
observations
;
then
I
closed
the
casement
,
all
but
a
chink
just
wide
enough
to
furnish
an
outlet
to
lovers
'
whispered
vows
:
then
I
stole
back
to
my
chair
;
and
as
I
resumed
it
the
pair
came
in
.
<EOS>
My
eye
was
quickly
at
the
aperture
.
<EOS>
Celine
's
chamber
-
maid
entered
,
lit
a
lamp
,
left
it
on
the
table
,
and
withdrew
.
<EOS>
The
couple
were
thus
revealed
to
me
clearly
:
both
removed
their
cloaks
,
and
there
was
"
the
Varens
,
"
shining
in
satin
and
jewels
,
 
my
gifts
of
course
,
 
and
there
was
her
companion
in
an
officer
's
uniform
;
and
I
knew
him
for
a
young
roue
of
a
vicomte
 
a
brainless
and
vicious
youth
whom
I
had
sometimes
met
in
society
,
and
had
never
thought
of
hating
because
I
despised
him
so
absolutely
.
<EOS>
On
recognising
him
,
the
fang
of
the
snake
Jealousy
was
instantly
broken
;
because
at
the
same
moment
my
love
for
Celine
sank
under
an
extinguisher
.
<EOS>
A
woman
who
could
betray
me
for
such
a
rival
was
not
worth
contending
for
;
she
deserved
<EOS>
only
scorn
;
less
,
however
,
than
I
,
who
had
been
her
dupe
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
began
to
talk
;
their
conversation
eased
me
completely
:
frivolous
,
mercenary
,
heartless
,
and
senseless
,
it
was
rather
calculated
to
weary
than
enrage
a
listener
.
<EOS>
A
card
of
mine
lay
on
the
table
;
this
being
perceived
,
brought
my
name
under
discussion
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
possessed
energy
or
wit
to
belabour
me
soundly
,
but
they
insulted
me
as
coarsely
as
they
could
in
their
little
way
:
especially
Celine
,
who
even
waxed
rather
brilliant
on
my
personal
defects
 
deformities
she
termed
them
.
<EOS>
Now
it
had
been
her
custom
to
launch
out
into
fervent
admiration
of
what
she
called
my
"
_
beaute
male
_
:
"
wherein
she
differed
diametrically
from
you
,
who
told
me
point
-
blank
,
at
the
second
interview
,
that
you
did
not
think
me
handsome
.
<EOS>
The
contrast
struck
me
at
the
time
and
 
"
  
Adele
here
came
running
up
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
John
has
just
been
to
say
that
your
agent
has
called
and
wishes
to
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
in
that
case
I
must
abridge
.
<EOS>
Opening
the
window
,
I
walked
in
upon
them
;
liberated
Celine
from
my
protection
;
gave
her
notice
to
vacate
her
hotel
;
offered
her
a
purse
for
immediate
exigencies
;
disregarded
screams
,
hysterics
,
prayers
,
protestations
,
convulsions
;
made
an
appointment
with
the
vicomte
for
a
meeting
at
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
I
had
the
pleasure
of
encountering
him
;
left
a
bullet
in
one
of
his
poor
etiolated
arms
,
feeble
as
the
wing
of
a
chicken
in
the
pip
,
and
then
thought
I
had
done
with
the
whole
crew
.
<EOS>
But
unluckily
the
Varens
,
six
months
before
,
had
given
me
this
filette
Adele
,
who
,
she
affirmed
,
was
my
daughter
;
and
perhaps
she
may
be
,
though
I
see
no
proofs
of
such
grim
paternity
written
in
her
countenance
:
Pilot
is
more
like
me
than
she
.
<EOS>
Some
years
after
I
had
broken
with
the
mother
,
she
abandoned
her
child
,
and
ran
away
to
Italy
with
a
musician
or
singer
.
<EOS>
I
acknowledged
no
natural
claim
on
Adele
's
part
to
be
supported
by
me
,
nor
do
I
now
acknowledge
any
,
for
I
am
not
her
father
;
but
hearing
that
she
was
quite
destitute
,
I
e'en
took
the
poor
thing
out
of
the
slime
and
mud
of
Paris
,
and
transplanted
it
here
,
to
grow
up
clean
in
the
wholesome
soil
of
an
English
country
garden
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
found
you
to
train
it
;
but
now
you
know
that
it
is
the
illegitimate
offspring
of
a
French
opera
-
girl
,
you
will
perhaps
think
differently
of
your
post
and
protegee
:
you
will
be
coming
to
me
some
day
with
notice
that
you
have
found
another
place
 
that
you
beg
me
to
look
out
for
a
new
governess
,
&
c.
 
Eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
:
Adele
is
not
answerable
for
either
her
mother
's
faults
or
yours
:
I
have
a
regard
for
her
;
and
now
that
I
know
she
is
,
in
a
sense
,
parentless
 
forsaken
by
her
mother
and
disowned
by
you
,
sir
 
<EOS>
I
shall
cling
closer
to
her
than
before
.
<EOS>
How
could
I
possibly
prefer
the
spoilt
pet
of
a
wealthy
family
,
who
would
hate
her
governess
as
a
nuisance
,
to
a
lonely
little
orphan
,
who
leans
towards
her
as
a
friend
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
is
the
light
in
which
you
view
it
!
<EOS>
Well
,
I
must
go
in
now
;
and
you
too
:
it
darkens
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
I
stayed
out
a
few
minutes
longer
with
<EOS>
Adele
and
Pilot
 
ran
a
race
with
her
,
and
played
a
game
of
battledore
and
shuttlecock
.
<EOS>
When
we
went
in
,
and
I
had
removed
her
bonnet
and
coat
<EOS>
,
I
took
her
on
my
knee
;
kept
her
there
an
hour
,
allowing
her
to
prattle
as
she
liked
:
not
rebuking
even
some
little
freedoms
and
trivialities
into
which
she
was
apt
to
stray
when
much
noticed
,
and
which
betrayed
in
her
a
superficiality
of
character
,
inherited
probably
from
her
mother
,
hardly
congenial
to
an
English
mind
.
<EOS>
Still
she
had
her
merits
;
and
I
was
disposed
to
appreciate
all
that
was
good
in
her
to
the
utmost
.
<EOS>
I
sought
in
her
countenance
and
features
a
likeness
to
Mr.
Rochester
,
but
found
none
:
<EOS>
no
trait
,
no
turn
of
expression
announced
relationship
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
pity
:
if
she
could
but
have
been
proved
to
resemble
him
,
he
would
have
thought
more
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
after
I
had
withdrawn
to
my
own
chamber
for
the
night
,
that
I
steadily
reviewed
the
tale
Mr.
Rochester
had
told
me
.
<EOS>
As
he
had
said
,
there
was
probably
nothing
at
all
extraordinary
in
the
substance
of
the
narrative
itself
:
a
wealthy
Englishman
's
passion
for
a
French
dancer
,
and
her
treachery
to
him
,
were
every
-
day
matters
enough
,
no
doubt
,
in
society
;
but
there
was
something
decidedly
strange
in
the
paroxysm
of
emotion
which
had
suddenly
seized
him
when
he
was
in
the
act
of
expressing
the
present
contentment
of
his
mood
,
and
his
newly
revived
pleasure
in
the
old
hall
and
its
environs
.
<EOS>
I
meditated
wonderingly
on
this
incident
;
but
gradually
quitting
it
,
as
I
found
it
for
the
present
inexplicable
,
I
turned
to
the
consideration
of
my
master
's
manner
to
myself
.
<EOS>
The
confidence
he
had
thought
fit
to
repose
in
me
seemed
a
tribute
to
my
discretion
:
I
regarded
and
accepted
it
as
such
.
<EOS>
His
deportment
had
now
for
some
weeks
been
more
uniform
towards
me
than
at
the
first
.
<EOS>
I
never
seemed
in
his
way
;
he
did
not
take
fits
of
chilling
hauteur
:
when
he
met
me
unexpectedly
,
the
encounter
seemed
welcome
;
he
had
always
a
word
and
sometimes
a
smile
for
me
:
when
summoned
by
formal
invitation
to
his
presence
,
I
was
honoured
by
a
cordiality
of
reception
that
made
me
feel
I
really
possessed
the
power
to
amuse
him
,
and
that
these
evening
conferences
were
sought
as
much
for
his
pleasure
as
for
my
benefit
.
  
<EOS>
I
,
indeed
,
talked
comparatively
little
,
but
I
heard
him
talk
with
relish
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
nature
to
be
communicative
;
he
liked
to
open
to
a
mind
unacquainted
with
the
world
glimpses
of
its
scenes
and
ways
<EOS>
(
I
do
not
mean
its
corrupt
scenes
and
wicked
ways
,
but
such
as
derived
their
interest
from
the
great
scale
on
which
they
were
acted
,
the
strange
novelty
by
which
they
were
characterised
)
;
and
I
had
a
keen
delight
in
receiving
the
new
ideas
he
offered
,
in
imagining
the
new
pictures
he
portrayed
,
and
following
him
in
thought
through
the
new
regions
he
disclosed
,
never
startled
or
troubled
by
one
noxious
allusion
.
  
<EOS>
The
ease
of
his
manner
freed
me
from
painful
restraint
:
the
friendly
frankness
,
as
correct
as
cordial
,
with
which
he
treated
me
,
drew
me
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
felt
at
times
as
if
he
were
my
relation
rather
than
my
master
:
yet
he
was
imperious
sometimes
still
;
but
I
did
not
mind
that
<EOS>
;
I
saw
it
was
his
way
.
<EOS>
So
happy
,
so
gratified
<EOS>
did
I
become
with
this
new
interest
added
to
life
,
that
I
ceased
to
pine
after
kindred
:
my
thin
crescent
-
destiny
seemed
to
enlarge
;
the
blanks
of
existence
were
filled
up
;
my
bodily
health
improved
;
I
gathered
flesh
and
strength
.
  
<EOS>
And
was
Mr.
Rochester
now
ugly
in
my
eyes
?
<EOS>
No
,
reader
:
gratitude
,
and
many
associations
,
<EOS>
all
pleasurable
and
genial
,
made
his
face
the
object
I
best
liked
to
see
;
his
presence
in
a
room
was
more
cheering
than
the
brightest
fire
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
had
not
forgotten
his
faults
;
indeed
,
I
could
not
,
for
he
brought
them
frequently
before
me
.
<EOS>
He
was
proud
,
sardonic
,
harsh
to
inferiority
of
every
description
:
in
my
secret
soul
I
knew
that
his
great
kindness
to
me
was
balanced
by
unjust
severity
to
many
others
.
<EOS>
He
was
moody
,
too
;
unaccountably
so
;
I
more
than
once
,
when
sent
for
to
read
to
him
,
found
him
sitting
in
his
library
alone
,
with
his
head
bent
on
his
folded
arms
;
and
,
when
he
looked
up
,
a
morose
,
almost
a
malignant
,
scowl
blackened
his
features
.
<EOS>
But
I
believed
that
his
moodiness
,
his
harshness
,
and
his
former
faults
of
morality
(
I
say
_
former
_
,
for
now
he
seemed
corrected
of
them
)
had
their
source
in
some
cruel
cross
of
fate
.
<EOS>
I
believed
he
was
naturally
a
man
of
better
tendencies
,
higher
principles
,
and
purer
tastes
than
such
as
circumstances
had
developed
,
education
instilled
,
or
destiny
encouraged
.
<EOS>
I
thought
there
were
excellent
materials
in
him
;
though
for
the
present
they
hung
together
somewhat
spoiled
and
tangled
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
deny
that
I
grieved
for
his
grief
,
whatever
that
was
,
and
would
have
given
much
to
assuage
it
.
  
<EOS>
Though
I
had
now
extinguished
my
candle
and
was
laid
down
in
bed
,
I
could
not
sleep
for
thinking
of
his
look
when
he
paused
in
the
avenue
,
and
told
how
his
destiny
had
risen
up
before
him
,
and
dared
him
to
be
happy
at
Thornfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
myself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
alienates
him
from
the
house
?
<EOS>
Will
he
leave
it
again
soon
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
said
he
seldom
stayed
here
longer
than
a
fortnight
at
a
time
;
and
he
has
now
been
resident
eight
weeks
.
<EOS>
If
he
does
go
,
the
change
will
be
doleful
.
<EOS>
Suppose
he
should
be
absent
spring
,
summer
,
and
autumn
:
how
joyless
sunshine
and
fine
days
will
seem
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
whether
I
had
slept
or
not
after
this
musing
;
at
any
rate
,
I
started
wide
awake
on
hearing
a
vague
murmur
,
peculiar
and
lugubrious
,
which
sounded
,
I
thought
,
just
above
me
.
<EOS>
I
wished
I
had
kept
my
candle
burning
:
the
night
was
drearily
dark
;
my
spirits
were
depressed
.
<EOS>
I
rose
and
sat
up
in
bed
,
listening
.
<EOS>
The
sound
was
hushed
.
  
<EOS>
I
tried
again
to
sleep
;
but
my
heart
beat
anxiously
:
my
inward
tranquillity
was
broken
.
<EOS>
The
clock
,
far
down
in
the
hall
,
struck
two
.
<EOS>
Just
then
it
seemed
my
chamber
-
door
was
touched
;
as
if
fingers
had
swept
the
panels
in
groping
a
way
along
the
dark
gallery
outside
.
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
Who
is
there
?
"
<EOS>
Nothing
answered
.
<EOS>
I
was
chilled
with
fear
.
  
<EOS>
All
at
once
I
remembered
that
it
might
be
Pilot
,
who
,
when
the
kitchen-
door
chanced
to
be
left
open
,
not
unfrequently
found
his
way
up
to
the
threshold
of
Mr.
Rochester
's
chamber
<EOS>
:
I
had
seen
him
lying
there
myself
in
the
mornings
.
<EOS>
The
idea
calmed
me
somewhat
:
I
lay
down
.
<EOS>
Silence
composes
the
nerves
;
and
as
an
unbroken
hush
now
reigned
again
through
the
whole
house
,
I
began
to
feel
the
return
of
slumber
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
fated
that
I
should
sleep
that
night
.
<EOS>
A
dream
had
scarcely
approached
my
ear
,
when
it
fled
affrighted
,
scared
by
a
marrow
-
freezing
incident
enough
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
demoniac
laugh
 
<EOS>
low
,
suppressed
,
and
deep
 
uttered
,
as
it
seemed
,
at
the
very
keyhole
of
my
chamber
door
.
<EOS>
The
head
of
my
bed
was
near
the
door
,
and
I
thought
at
first
<EOS>
the
goblin
-
laugher
stood
at
my
bedside
 
or
rather
,
crouched
by
my
pillow
:
but
I
rose
,
looked
round
,
and
could
see
nothing
;
while
,
as
I
still
gazed
,
the
unnatural
sound
was
reiterated
:
and
I
knew
it
came
from
behind
the
panels
.
<EOS>
My
first
impulse
was
to
rise
and
fasten
the
bolt
;
my
next
,
again
to
cry
out
,
"
Who
is
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
Something
gurgled
and
moaned
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
steps
retreated
up
the
gallery
towards
the
third
-
storey
staircase
:
a
door
had
lately
been
made
to
shut
in
that
staircase
;
I
heard
it
open
and
close
,
and
all
was
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
that
Grace
Poole
?
<EOS>
and
is
she
possessed
with
a
devil
?
<EOS>
"
thought
I.
Impossible
now
to
remain
longer
by
myself
:
I
must
go
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
I
hurried
on
my
frock
and
a
shawl
;
I
withdrew
the
bolt
and
opened
the
door
with
a
trembling
hand
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
candle
burning
just
outside
,
and
on
the
matting
in
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
I
was
surprised
at
this
circumstance
:
but
still
more
was
I
amazed
to
perceive
the
air
quite
dim
,
as
if
filled
with
smoke
;
and
,
while
looking
to
the
right
hand
and
left
,
to
find
whence
these
blue
wreaths
issued
,
I
became
further
aware
of
a
strong
smell
of
burning
.
  
<EOS>
Something
creaked
:
it
was
a
door
ajar
;
and
that
door
was
Mr.
Rochester
's
,
and
the
smoke
rushed
in
a
cloud
from
thence
.
<EOS>
I
thought
no
more
of
Mrs.
Fairfax
;
I
thought
no
more
of
Grace
Poole
,
or
the
laugh
:
in
an
instant
,
I
was
within
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
Tongues
of
flame
darted
round
the
bed
:
the
curtains
were
on
fire
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
blaze
and
vapour
,
Mr.
Rochester
lay
stretched
motionless
,
in
deep
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wake
!
<EOS>
wake
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
.
<EOS>
I
shook
him
,
but
he
only
murmured
and
turned
:
the
smoke
had
stupefied
him
.
<EOS>
Not
a
moment
could
be
lost
:
the
very
sheets
were
kindling
,
I
rushed
to
his
basin
and
ewer
;
fortunately
,
one
was
wide
and
the
other
deep
,
and
both
were
filled
with
water
.
<EOS>
I
heaved
them
up
,
deluged
the
bed
and
its
occupant
,
flew
back
to
my
own
room
,
brought
my
own
water
-
jug
,
baptized
the
couch
afresh
,
and
,
by
God
's
aid
,
succeeded
in
extinguishing
the
flames
which
were
devouring
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
hiss
of
the
quenched
element
,
the
breakage
of
a
pitcher
which
I
flung
from
my
hand
when
I
had
emptied
it
,
and
,
above
all
,
the
splash
of
the
shower
-
bath
I
had
liberally
bestowed
,
roused
Mr.
Rochester
at
last
.
<EOS>
Though
it
was
now
dark
,
I
knew
he
was
awake
;
because
I
heard
him
fulminating
strange
anathemas
at
finding
himself
lying
in
a
pool
of
water
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
a
flood
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
I
answered
;
"
but
there
has
been
a
fire
:
get
up
,
do
;
you
are
quenched
now
;
I
will
fetch
you
a
candle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
name
of
all
the
elves
in
Christendom
,
is
that
Jane
Eyre
?
"
<EOS>
he
demanded
.
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
done
with
me
,
witch
,
sorceress
?
<EOS>
Who
is
in
the
room
besides
you
?
<EOS>
Have
you
plotted
to
drown
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
fetch
you
a
candle
,
sir
;
and
,
in
Heaven
's
name
,
get
up
.
<EOS>
Somebody
has
plotted
something
:
you
can
not
too
soon
find
out
who
and
what
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
<EOS>
I
am
up
now
;
but
at
your
peril
you
fetch
a
candle
yet
:
<EOS>
wait
two
minutes
till
I
get
into
some
dry
garments
,
if
any
dry
there
be
 
<EOS>
yes
,
here
is
my
dressing
-
gown
.
<EOS>
Now
run
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
run
;
I
brought
the
candle
which
still
remained
in
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
He
took
it
from
my
hand
,
held
it
up
,
and
surveyed
the
bed
,
all
blackened
and
scorched
,
the
sheets
drenched
,
the
carpet
round
swimming
in
water
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
<EOS>
and
who
did
it
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
I
briefly
related
to
him
what
had
transpired
:
the
strange
laugh
I
had
heard
in
the
gallery
:
the
step
ascending
to
the
third
storey
;
the
smoke
,
 
the
smell
of
fire
which
had
conducted
me
to
his
room
;
in
what
state
I
had
found
matters
there
,
and
how
I
had
deluged
him
with
all
the
water
I
could
lay
hands
on
.
  
<EOS>
{
"
What
is
it
and
who
did
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
:
p140.jpg
}
  
<EOS>
He
listened
very
gravely
;
his
face
,
as
I
went
on
,
expressed
more
concern
than
astonishment
;
he
did
not
immediately
speak
when
I
had
concluded
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
call
Mrs.
Fairfax
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Fairfax
?
<EOS>
No
;
what
the
deuce
would
you
call
her
for
?
<EOS>
What
can
she
do
?
<EOS>
Let
her
sleep
unmolested
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
fetch
Leah
,
and
wake
John
and
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
:
just
be
still
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
shawl
on
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
not
warm
enough
,
you
may
take
my
cloak
yonder
;
wrap
it
about
you
,
and
sit
down
in
the
arm
-
chair
:
there
,
 
I
will
put
it
on
.
<EOS>
Now
place
your
feet
on
the
stool
,
to
keep
them
out
of
the
wet
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
leave
you
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
I
shall
take
the
candle
.
<EOS>
Remain
where
you
are
till
I
return
;
be
as
still
as
a
mouse
.
<EOS>
I
must
pay
a
visit
to
the
second
storey
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
move
,
remember
,
or
call
any
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
went
:
<EOS>
I
watched
the
light
withdraw
.
<EOS>
He
passed
up
the
gallery
very
softly
,
unclosed
the
staircase
door
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
,
shut
it
after
him
,
and
the
last
ray
vanished
.
<EOS>
I
was
left
in
total
darkness
.
<EOS>
I
listened
for
some
noise
,
but
heard
nothing
.
<EOS>
A
very
long
time
elapsed
.
<EOS>
I
grew
weary
:
<EOS>
it
was
cold
,
in
spite
of
the
cloak
;
and
then
I
did
not
see
the
use
of
staying
,
as
I
was
not
to
rouse
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
was
on
the
point
of
risking
Mr.
Rochester
's
displeasure
by
disobeying
his
orders
,
when
the
light
once
more
gleamed
dimly
on
the
gallery
wall
,
and
I
heard
his
unshod
feet
tread
the
matting
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
is
he
,
"
thought
I
,
"
and
not
something
worse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
re
-
entered
,
pale
and
very
gloomy
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
found
it
all
out
,
"
said
he
,
setting
his
candle
down
on
the
washstand
;
"
it
is
as
I
thought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
made
no
reply
,
but
stood
with
his
arms
folded
,
looking
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
a
few
minutes
he
inquired
in
rather
a
peculiar
tone
    
<EOS>
"
I
forget
whether
you
said
you
saw
anything
when
you
opened
your
chamber
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
sir
,
only
the
candlestick
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
heard
an
odd
laugh
?
<EOS>
You
have
heard
that
laugh
before
,
I
should
think
,
or
something
like
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
:
there
is
a
woman
who
sews
here
,
called
Grace
Poole
,
 
<EOS>
she
laughs
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
singular
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Just
so
.
<EOS>
Grace
Poole
 
you
have
guessed
it
.
<EOS>
She
is
,
as
you
say
,
singular
 
very
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
shall
reflect
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
I
am
glad
that
you
are
the
only
person
,
besides
myself
,
acquainted
with
the
precise
details
of
to
-
night
's
incident
.
<EOS>
You
are
no
talking
fool
:
say
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
account
for
this
state
of
affairs
"
(
pointing
to
the
bed
)
:
"
and
now
return
to
your
own
room
.
<EOS>
I
shall
do
very
well
on
the
sofa
in
the
library
for
the
rest
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
It
is
near
four
:
 
in
two
hours
the
servants
will
be
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
then
,
sir
,
"
said
I
,
departing
.
  
<EOS>
He
seemed
surprised
 
very
inconsistently
so
,
as
he
had
just
told
me
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
"
are
you
quitting
me
already
,
and
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
said
I
might
go
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
not
without
taking
leave
;
not
without
a
word
or
two
of
acknowledgment
and
good
-
will
:
not
,
in
short
,
in
that
brief
,
dry
fashion
.
<EOS>
Why
,
you
have
saved
my
life
!
 
<EOS>
snatched
me
from
a
horrible
and
excruciating
death
!
<EOS>
and
you
walk
past
me
as
if
we
were
mutual
strangers
!
<EOS>
At
least
shake
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
held
out
his
hand
;
I
gave
him
mine
:
he
took
it
first
in
one
,
them
in
both
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
saved
my
life
:
I
have
a
pleasure
in
owing
you
so
immense
a
debt
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
more
.
<EOS>
Nothing
else
that
has
being
would
have
been
tolerable
to
me
in
the
character
of
creditor
for
such
an
obligation
:
but
you
:
<EOS>
it
is
different
;
 
I
feel
your
benefits
no
burden
,
Jane
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
;
gazed
at
me
:
words
almost
visible
trembled
on
his
lips
,
 
but
his
voice
was
checked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
again
,
sir
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
debt
,
benefit
,
burden
,
obligation
,
in
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
knew
,
"
he
continued
,
"
you
would
do
me
good
in
some
way
,
at
some
time
;
 
I
saw
it
in
your
eyes
when
I
first
beheld
you
:
<EOS>
their
expression
and
smile
did
not
"
 
(
again
he
stopped
)
 
<EOS>
"
did
not
"
(
he
proceeded
hastily
)
<EOS>
"
strike
delight
to
my
very
inmost
heart
so
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
People
talk
of
natural
sympathies
;
I
have
heard
of
good
genii
:
there
are
grains
of
truth
in
the
wildest
fable
.
<EOS>
My
cherished
preserver
,
goodnight
!
"
  
<EOS>
Strange
energy
was
in
his
voice
,
strange
fire
in
his
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
I
happened
to
be
awake
,
"
I
said
:
<EOS>
and
then
I
was
going
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
you
_
will
_
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
cold
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cold
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
 
and
standing
in
a
pool
!
<EOS>
Go
,
then
,
Jane
;
go
!
"
<EOS>
But
he
still
retained
my
hand
,
and
I
could
not
free
it
.
<EOS>
I
bethought
myself
of
an
expedient
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
hear
Mrs.
Fairfax
move
,
sir
,
"
said
I.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
leave
me
:
"
he
relaxed
his
fingers
,
and
I
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
I
regained
my
couch
,
but
never
thought
of
sleep
.
<EOS>
Till
morning
dawned
I
was
tossed
on
a
buoyant
but
unquiet
sea
,
where
billows
of
trouble
rolled
under
surges
of
joy
.
<EOS>
I
thought
sometimes
I
saw
beyond
its
wild
waters
a
shore
,
sweet
as
the
hills
of
Beulah
;
and
now
and
then
a
freshening
gale
,
wakened
by
hope
,
bore
my
spirit
triumphantly
towards
the
bourne
:
but
I
could
not
reach
it
,
even
in
fancy
 
<EOS>
a
counteracting
breeze
blew
off
land
,
and
continually
drove
me
back
.
<EOS>
Sense
would
resist
delirium
:
judgment
would
warn
passion
.
<EOS>
Too
feverish
to
rest
,
I
rose
as
soon
as
day
dawned
.
    
<EOS>
I
both
wished
and
feared
to
see
Mr.
Rochester
on
the
day
which
followed
this
sleepless
night
:
I
wanted
to
hear
his
voice
again
,
yet
feared
to
meet
his
eye
.
<EOS>
During
the
early
part
of
the
morning
,
I
momentarily
expected
his
coming
;
he
was
not
in
the
frequent
habit
of
entering
the
schoolroom
,
but
he
did
step
in
for
a
few
minutes
sometimes
,
and
I
had
the
impression
that
he
was
sure
to
visit
it
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
morning
passed
just
as
usual
:
nothing
happened
to
interrupt
the
quiet
course
of
Adele
's
studies
;
only
soon
after
breakfast
,
I
heard
some
bustle
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Mr.
Rochester
's
chamber
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
voice
,
and
Leah
's
,
and
the
cook
's
 
that
is
,
John
's
wife
 
and
even
John
's
own
gruff
tones
.
<EOS>
There
were
exclamations
of
"
What
a
mercy
master
was
not
burnt
in
his
bed
!
"
<EOS>
"
It
is
always
dangerous
to
keep
a
candle
lit
at
night
.
"
<EOS>
"
How
providential
that
he
had
presence
of
mind
to
think
of
the
water
-
jug
!
"
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
he
waked
nobody
!
"
<EOS>
"
It
is
to
be
hoped
he
will
not
take
cold
with
sleeping
on
the
library
sofa
,
"
&
c.
  
<EOS>
To
much
confabulation
succeeded
a
sound
of
scrubbing
and
setting
to
rights
;
and
when
I
passed
the
room
,
in
going
downstairs
to
dinner
,
I
saw
through
the
open
door
that
all
was
again
restored
to
complete
order
;
only
the
bed
was
stripped
of
its
hangings
.
<EOS>
Leah
stood
up
in
the
window
-
seat
,
rubbing
the
panes
of
glass
dimmed
with
smoke
.
<EOS>
I
was
about
to
address
her
,
for
I
wished
to
know
what
account
had
been
given
of
the
affair
:
but
,
on
advancing
,
I
saw
a
second
person
in
the
chamber
 
<EOS>
a
woman
sitting
on
a
chair
by
the
bedside
,
and
sewing
rings
to
new
curtains
.
<EOS>
That
woman
was
no
other
than
Grace
Poole
.
  
<EOS>
There
she
sat
,
staid
and
taciturn
-
looking
,
as
usual
,
in
her
brown
stuff
gown
,
her
check
apron
,
white
handkerchief
,
and
cap
.
<EOS>
She
was
intent
on
her
work
,
in
which
her
whole
thoughts
seemed
absorbed
:
on
her
hard
forehead
,
and
in
her
commonplace
features
,
was
nothing
either
of
the
paleness
or
desperation
<EOS>
one
would
have
expected
to
see
marking
the
countenance
of
a
woman
who
had
attempted
murder
,
and
whose
intended
victim
had
followed
her
last
night
to
her
lair
,
and
(
as
I
believed
)
,
charged
her
with
the
crime
she
wished
to
perpetrate
.
<EOS>
I
was
amazed
 
confounded
.
<EOS>
She
looked
up
,
while
I
still
gazed
at
her
:
<EOS>
no
start
,
no
increase
or
failure
of
colour
betrayed
emotion
,
consciousness
of
guilt
,
or
fear
of
detection
.
<EOS>
She
said
"
Good
morning
,
Miss
,
"
in
her
usual
phlegmatic
and
brief
manner
;
and
taking
up
another
ring
and
more
tape
,
went
on
with
her
sewing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
put
her
to
some
test
,
"
thought
I
:
"
such
absolute
impenetrability
is
past
comprehension
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
morning
,
Grace
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Has
anything
happened
here
?
<EOS>
I
thought
I
heard
the
servants
all
talking
together
a
while
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Only
master
had
been
reading
in
his
bed
last
night
;
he
fell
asleep
with
his
candle
lit
,
and
the
curtains
got
on
fire
;
but
,
fortunately
,
he
awoke
before
the
bed
-
clothes
or
the
wood
-
work
caught
,
and
contrived
to
quench
the
flames
with
the
water
in
the
ewer
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
strange
affair
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
in
a
low
voice
:
then
,
looking
at
her
fixedly
 
"
Did
Mr.
Rochester
wake
nobody
?
<EOS>
Did
no
one
hear
him
move
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
again
raised
her
eyes
to
me
,
and
this
time
there
was
something
of
consciousness
in
their
expression
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
examine
me
warily
;
then
she
answered
    
"
The
servants
sleep
so
far
off
,
you
know
,
Miss
,
they
would
not
be
likely
to
hear
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
room
and
yours
are
the
nearest
to
master
's
;
but
Mrs.
Fairfax
said
she
heard
nothing
:
when
people
get
elderly
,
they
often
sleep
heavy
.
"
<EOS>
She
paused
,
and
then
added
,
with
a
sort
of
assumed
indifference
,
but
still
in
a
marked
and
significant
tone
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
young
,
Miss
;
and
I
should
say
a
light
sleeper
<EOS>
:
perhaps
you
may
have
heard
a
noise
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
"
said
I
,
dropping
my
voice
,
so
that
Leah
,
who
was
still
polishing
the
panes
,
could
not
hear
me
,
"
and
at
first
I
thought
it
was
Pilot
:
<EOS>
but
Pilot
can
not
laugh
;
and
I
am
certain
I
heard
a
laugh
,
and
a
strange
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
took
a
new
needleful
of
thread
,
waxed
it
carefully
,
threaded
her
needle
with
a
steady
hand
,
and
then
observed
,
with
perfect
composure
    
<EOS>
"
It
is
hardly
likely
master
would
laugh
,
I
should
think
,
Miss
,
when
he
was
in
such
danger
:
You
must
have
been
dreaming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
dreaming
,
"
I
said
,
with
some
warmth
,
for
her
brazen
coolness
provoked
me
.
<EOS>
Again
she
looked
at
me
;
and
with
the
same
scrutinising
and
conscious
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
told
master
that
you
heard
a
laugh
?
"
<EOS>
she
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
had
the
opportunity
of
speaking
to
him
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
not
think
of
opening
your
door
and
looking
out
into
the
gallery
?
<EOS>
"
she
further
asked
.
  
<EOS>
She
appeared
to
be
cross
-
questioning
me
,
attempting
to
draw
from
me
<EOS>
information
unawares
.
<EOS>
The
idea
struck
me
that
if
she
discovered
I
knew
or
suspected
her
guilt
,
she
would
be
playing
of
some
of
her
malignant
pranks
on
me
;
I
thought
it
advisable
to
be
on
my
guard
.
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
"
said
I
,
"
I
bolted
my
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
not
in
the
habit
of
bolting
your
door
every
night
before
you
get
into
bed
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fiend
!
<EOS>
she
wants
to
know
my
habits
,
that
she
may
lay
her
plans
accordingly
!
"
<EOS>
Indignation
again
prevailed
over
prudence
:
I
replied
sharply
,
"
Hitherto
I
have
often
omitted
to
fasten
the
bolt
:
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
it
necessary
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
aware
any
danger
or
annoyance
was
to
be
dreaded
at
Thornfield
Hall
:
but
in
future
"
(
and
I
laid
marked
stress
on
the
words
)
"
I
shall
take
good
care
to
make
all
secure
before
I
venture
to
lie
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
wise
so
to
do
,
"
was
her
answer
:
"
this
neighbourhood
is
as
quiet
as
any
I
know
,
and
I
never
heard
of
the
hall
being
attempted
by
robbers
since
it
was
a
house
;
though
there
are
hundreds
of
pounds
'
worth
of
plate
in
the
plate
-
closet
,
as
is
well
known
.
<EOS>
And
you
see
,
for
such
a
large
house
,
there
are
very
few
servants
,
because
master
has
never
lived
here
much
;
and
when
he
does
come
,
being
a
bachelor
,
he
needs
little
waiting
on
:
<EOS>
but
I
always
think
it
best
to
err
on
the
safe
side
;
a
door
is
soon
fastened
,
and
it
is
as
well
to
have
a
drawn
bolt
between
one
and
any
mischief
that
may
be
about
.
<EOS>
A
deal
of
people
,
Miss
,
are
for
trusting
all
to
Providence
;
but
I
say
Providence
will
not
dispense
with
the
means
,
though
He
often
blesses
them
when
they
are
used
discreetly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
here
she
closed
her
harangue
:
a
long
one
for
her
,
and
uttered
with
the
demureness
of
a
Quakeress
.
  
<EOS>
I
still
stood
absolutely
dumfoundered
at
what
appeared
to
me
her
miraculous
self
-
possession
and
most
inscrutable
hypocrisy
,
when
the
cook
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Poole
,
"
said
she
,
addressing
Grace
,
"
the
servants
'
dinner
will
soon
be
ready
:
will
you
come
down
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
just
put
my
pint
of
porter
and
bit
of
pudding
on
a
tray
,
and
I
'll
carry
it
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have
some
meat
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Just
a
morsel
,
and
a
taste
of
cheese
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
the
sago
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
it
at
present
:
I
shall
be
coming
down
before
teatime
:
I
'll
make
it
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
cook
here
turned
to
me
,
saying
that
Mrs.
Fairfax
was
waiting
for
me
:
so
I
departed
.
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
heard
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
account
of
the
curtain
conflagration
during
dinner
,
so
much
was
I
occupied
in
puzzling
my
brains
over
the
enigmatical
character
of
Grace
Poole
,
and
still
more
in
pondering
the
problem
of
her
position
at
Thornfield
and
questioning
why
she
had
not
been
given
into
custody
that
morning
,
or
,
at
the
very
least
,
dismissed
from
her
master
's
service
.
<EOS>
He
had
almost
as
much
as
declared
his
conviction
of
her
criminality
last
night
:
what
mysterious
cause
withheld
him
from
accusing
her
?
<EOS>
Why
had
he
enjoined
me
,
too
,
to
secrecy
?
<EOS>
It
was
strange
:
a
bold
,
vindictive
,
and
haughty
gentleman
seemed
somehow
in
the
power
of
one
of
the
meanest
of
his
dependants
;
so
much
in
her
power
,
that
even
when
she
lifted
her
hand
against
his
life
,
he
dared
not
openly
charge
her
with
the
attempt
,
much
less
punish
her
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
Had
Grace
been
young
and
handsome
,
I
should
have
been
tempted
to
think
that
tenderer
feelings
than
prudence
or
fear
influenced
Mr.
Rochester
in
her
behalf
;
but
,
hard
-
favoured
and
matronly
as
she
was
,
the
idea
could
not
be
admitted
.
"
<EOS>
Yet
,
"
I
reflected
,
"
she
has
been
young
once
;
her
youth
would
be
contemporary
with
her
master
's
:
Mrs.
Fairfax
told
me
once
,
she
had
lived
here
many
years
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
she
can
ever
have
been
pretty
;
but
,
for
aught
I
know
,
she
may
possess
originality
and
strength
of
character
to
compensate
for
the
want
of
personal
advantages
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
is
an
amateur
of
the
decided
and
eccentric
:
Grace
is
eccentric
at
least
.
<EOS>
What
if
a
former
caprice
(
a
freak
very
possible
to
a
nature
so
sudden
and
headstrong
as
his
)
has
delivered
him
into
her
power
,
and
she
now
exercises
over
his
actions
a
secret
influence
,
the
result
of
his
own
indiscretion
,
which
he
can
not
shake
off
,
and
dare
not
disregard
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
having
reached
this
point
of
conjecture
,
Mrs.
Poole
's
square
,
flat
figure
,
and
uncomely
,
dry
,
even
coarse
face
,
recurred
so
distinctly
to
my
mind
's
eye
,
that
I
thought
,
"
No
;
impossible
!
<EOS>
my
supposition
can
not
be
correct
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
"
suggested
the
secret
voice
which
talks
to
us
in
our
own
hearts
,
"
you
are
not
beautiful
either
,
and
perhaps
Mr.
Rochester
approves
you
:
at
any
rate
,
you
have
often
felt
as
if
he
did
;
and
last
night
 
remember
his
words
;
remember
his
look
;
remember
his
voice
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
well
remembered
all
;
language
,
glance
,
and
tone
seemed
at
the
moment
vividly
renewed
.
<EOS>
I
was
now
in
the
schoolroom
;
Adele
was
drawing
;
I
bent
over
her
and
directed
her
pencil
.
<EOS>
She
looked
up
with
a
sort
of
start
.
  
<EOS>
"
Qu
'
avez
-
vous
,
mademoiselle
?
"
said
she

Vos
doigts
tremblent
comme
la
feuille
,
et
vos
joues
sont
rouges

mais
,
rouges
comme
des
cerises
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
hot
,
Adele
,
with
stooping
!
"
<EOS>
She
went
on
sketching
;
I
went
on
thinking
.
  
<EOS>
I
hastened
to
drive
from
my
mind
the
hateful
notion
I
had
been
conceiving
respecting
Grace
Poole
;
it
disgusted
me
.
<EOS>
I
compared
myself
with
her
,
and
found
we
were
different
.
<EOS>
Bessie
Leaven
had
said
I
was
quite
a
lady
;
and
she
spoke
truth
 
<EOS>
I
was
a
lady
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
looked
much
better
than
I
did
when
Bessie
saw
me
;
I
had
more
colour
and
more
flesh
,
more
life
,
more
vivacity
,
because
I
had
brighter
hopes
and
keener
enjoyments
.
  
<EOS>
"
Evening
approaches
,
"
said
I
,
as
I
looked
towards
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
heard
Mr.
Rochester
's
voice
or
step
in
the
house
to
-
day
;
but
surely
I
shall
see
him
before
night
:
I
feared
the
meeting
in
the
morning
;
now
I
desire
it
,
because
expectation
has
been
so
long
baffled
that
it
is
grown
impatient
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
dusk
actually
closed
,
and
when
Adele
left
me
to
go
and
play
in
the
nursery
with
Sophie
,
I
did
most
keenly
desire
it
.
<EOS>
I
listened
for
the
bell
to
ring
below
;
I
listened
for
Leah
coming
up
with
a
message
;
I
fancied
<EOS>
sometimes
I
heard
Mr.
Rochester
's
own
tread
,
and
I
turned
to
the
door
,
expecting
it
to
open
and
admit
him
.
<EOS>
The
door
remained
shut
;
darkness
only
came
in
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
Still
it
was
not
late
;
he
often
sent
for
me
at
seven
and
eight
o'clock
,
and
it
was
yet
but
six
.
<EOS>
Surely
I
should
not
be
wholly
disappointed
to
-
night
,
when
I
had
so
many
things
to
say
to
him
!
<EOS>
I
wanted
again
to
introduce
the
subject
of
Grace
Poole
,
and
to
hear
what
he
would
answer
;
I
wanted
to
ask
him
plainly
if
he
really
believed
it
was
she
who
had
made
last
night
's
hideous
attempt
;
and
if
so
,
why
he
kept
her
wickedness
a
secret
.
<EOS>
It
little
mattered
whether
my
curiosity
irritated
him
;
I
knew
the
pleasure
of
vexing
and
soothing
him
by
turns
;
it
was
one
I
chiefly
delighted
in
,
and
<EOS>
a
sure
instinct
always
prevented
me
from
going
too
far
;
beyond
the
verge
of
provocation
I
never
ventured
;
on
the
extreme
brink
I
liked
well
to
try
my
skill
.
<EOS>
Retaining
every
minute
form
of
respect
,
every
propriety
of
my
station
,
I
could
still
meet
him
in
argument
without
fear
or
uneasy
restraint
;
this
suited
both
him
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
A
tread
creaked
on
the
stairs
at
last
.
<EOS>
Leah
made
her
appearance
;
but
it
was
only
to
intimate
that
tea
was
ready
in
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
room
.
<EOS>
Thither
I
repaired
,
glad
at
least
to
go
downstairs
;
for
that
brought
me
,
I
imagined
,
nearer
to
Mr.
Rochester
's
presence
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
want
your
tea
,
"
said
the
good
lady
,
as
I
joined
her
;
"
you
ate
so
little
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
<EOS>
,
"
she
continued
,
"
you
are
not
well
<EOS>
to-
day
:
you
look
flushed
and
feverish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
quite
well
!
<EOS>
I
never
felt
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
must
prove
it
by
evincing
a
good
appetite
;
will
you
fill
the
teapot
while
I
knit
off
this
needle
?
"
<EOS>
Having
completed
her
task
,
she
rose
to
draw
down
the
blind
,
which
she
had
hitherto
kept
up
,
by
way
,
I
suppose
,
of
making
the
most
of
daylight
,
though
dusk
was
now
fast
deepening
into
total
obscurity
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
fair
to
-
night
,
"
said
she
,
as
she
looked
through
the
panes
,
"
though
not
starlight
;
Mr.
Rochester
has
,
on
the
whole
,
had
a
favourable
day
for
his
journey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Journey
!
 
<EOS>
Is
Mr.
Rochester
gone
anywhere
?
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
he
was
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
set
off
the
moment
he
had
breakfasted
!
<EOS>
He
is
gone
to
the
Leas
,
Mr.
Eshton
's
place
,
ten
miles
on
the
other
side
Millcote
.
<EOS>
I
believe
there
is
quite
a
party
assembled
there
;
Lord
Ingram
,
Sir
George
Lynn
,
Colonel
Dent
,
and
others
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
expect
him
back
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
 
nor
to
-
morrow
either
<EOS>
;
I
should
think
he
is
very
likely
to
stay
a
week
or
more
:
<EOS>
when
these
fine
,
fashionable
people
get
together
,
they
are
so
surrounded
by
elegance
and
gaiety
,
so
well
provided
with
all
that
can
please
and
entertain
,
they
are
in
no
hurry
to
separate
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
especially
are
often
in
request
on
such
occasions
;
and
Mr.
Rochester
is
so
talented
and
so
lively
in
society
,
that
I
believe
he
is
a
general
favourite
:
the
ladies
are
very
fond
of
him
;
though
you
would
not
think
his
appearance
calculated
to
recommend
him
particularly
in
their
eyes
:
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
his
acquirements
and
abilities
,
perhaps
his
wealth
and
good
blood
,
make
amends
for
any
little
fault
of
look
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
there
ladies
at
the
Leas
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
Mrs.
Eshton
and
her
three
daughters
 
very
elegant
young
ladies
indeed
;
and
there
are
the
Honourable
Blanche
and
Mary
Ingram
,
most
beautiful
women
,
I
suppose
:
indeed
I
have
seen
Blanche
,
six
or
seven
years
since
,
when
she
was
a
girl
of
eighteen
.
<EOS>
She
came
here
to
a
Christmas
ball
and
party
Mr.
Rochester
gave
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
seen
the
dining
-
room
that
day
 
<EOS>
how
richly
it
was
decorated
,
how
brilliantly
lit
up
!
<EOS>
I
should
think
there
were
fifty
ladies
and
gentlemen
present
 
all
of
the
first
county
families
;
and
Miss
Ingram
was
considered
the
belle
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
saw
her
,
you
say
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
<EOS>
:
what
was
she
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
saw
her
.
<EOS>
The
dining
-
room
doors
were
thrown
open
;
and
,
as
it
was
Christmas
-
time
,
the
servants
were
allowed
to
assemble
in
the
hall
,
to
hear
some
of
the
ladies
sing
and
play
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
would
have
me
to
come
in
,
and
I
sat
down
in
a
quiet
corner
and
watched
them
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
a
more
splendid
scene
:
the
ladies
were
magnificently
dressed
;
most
of
them
 
at
least
most
of
the
younger
ones
 
looked
handsome
;
but
Miss
Ingram
was
certainly
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
was
she
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tall
,
fine
bust
,
sloping
shoulders
;
long
,
graceful
neck
:
olive
complexion
,
dark
and
clear
;
noble
features
;
eyes
rather
like
Mr.
Rochester
's
:
large
and
black
,
<EOS>
and
as
brilliant
as
her
jewels
.
<EOS>
And
then
she
had
such
a
fine
head
of
hair
;
raven
-
black
and
so
becomingly
arranged
:
a
crown
of
thick
plaits
behind
,
and
in
front
the
longest
,
the
glossiest
curls
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
She
was
dressed
in
pure
white
;
an
amber
-
coloured
scarf
was
passed
over
her
shoulder
and
across
her
breast
,
tied
at
the
side
,
and
descending
in
long
,
fringed
ends
below
her
knee
.
<EOS>
She
wore
an
amber
-
coloured
flower
,
too
,
in
her
hair
:
it
contrasted
well
with
the
jetty
mass
of
her
curls
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
greatly
admired
,
of
course
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
:
and
not
only
for
her
beauty
,
but
for
her
accomplishments
.
<EOS>
She
was
one
of
the
ladies
who
sang
:
a
gentleman
accompanied
her
on
the
piano
.
<EOS>
She
and
Mr.
Rochester
sang
a
duet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
?
<EOS>
I
was
not
aware
he
could
sing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
he
has
a
fine
bass
voice
,
and
an
excellent
taste
for
music
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
Miss
Ingram
:
<EOS>
what
sort
of
a
voice
had
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
rich
and
powerful
one
<EOS>
:
she
sang
delightfully
;
it
was
a
treat
to
listen
to
her
;
 
and
she
played
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
am
no
judge
of
music
,
but
Mr.
Rochester
is
;
and
I
heard
him
say
her
execution
was
remarkably
good
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
this
beautiful
and
accomplished
lady
,
she
is
not
yet
married
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
appears
not
:
I
fancy
<EOS>
neither
she
nor
her
sister
have
very
large
fortunes
.
<EOS>
Old
Lord
Ingram
's
estates
were
chiefly
entailed
,
and
the
eldest
son
came
in
for
everything
almost
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
wonder
no
wealthy
nobleman
or
gentleman
has
taken
a
fancy
to
her
:
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
,
for
instance
.
<EOS>
He
is
rich
,
is
he
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
But
you
see
there
is
a
considerable
difference
in
age
:
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
is
nearly
forty
;
she
is
but
twenty
-
five
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
of
that
?
<EOS>
More
unequal
matches
are
made
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
:
yet
<EOS>
I
should
scarcely
fancy
Mr.
Rochester
would
entertain
an
idea
of
the
sort
.
<EOS>
But
you
eat
nothing
:
you
have
scarcely
tasted
since
you
began
tea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
:
I
am
too
thirsty
to
eat
.
<EOS>
Will
you
let
me
have
another
cup
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
about
again
to
revert
to
the
probability
of
a
union
between
Mr.
Rochester
and
the
beautiful
Blanche
;
but
Adele
came
in
,
and
the
conversation
was
turned
into
another
channel
.
  
<EOS>
When
once
more
alone
,
I
reviewed
the
information
I
had
got
;
looked
into
my
heart
,
examined
its
thoughts
and
feelings
,
and
endeavoured
to
bring
back
with
a
strict
hand
such
as
had
been
straying
through
imagination
's
boundless
and
trackless
waste
,
into
the
safe
fold
of
common
sense
.
  
<EOS>
Arraigned
at
my
own
bar
,
Memory
having
given
her
evidence
of
the
hopes
,
wishes
,
sentiments
I
had
been
cherishing
since
last
night
 
of
the
general
state
of
mind
in
which
I
had
indulged
for
nearly
a
fortnight
past
;
Reason
having
come
forward
and
told
,
in
her
own
quiet
way
a
plain
,
unvarnished
tale
,
showing
how
I
had
rejected
the
real
,
and
rabidly
devoured
the
ideal
;
 
I
pronounced
judgment
to
this
effect
:
    
That
a
greater
fool
than
Jane
Eyre
had
never
breathed
the
breath
of
life
;
that
a
more
fantastic
idiot
had
never
surfeited
herself
on
sweet
lies
,
and
swallowed
poison
as
if
it
were
nectar
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
You
_
,
"
I
said
,
"
a
favourite
with
Mr.
Rochester
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
gifted
with
the
power
of
pleasing
him
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
of
importance
to
him
in
any
way
?
<EOS>
Go
!
<EOS>
your
folly
sickens
me
.
<EOS>
And
you
have
derived
pleasure
from
occasional
tokens
of
preference
 
equivocal
tokens
shown
by
a
gentleman
of
family
and
a
man
of
the
world
to
a
dependent
and
a
novice
.
<EOS>
How
dared
you
?
<EOS>
Poor
stupid
dupe
!
 
<EOS>
Could
not
even
self
-
interest
make
you
wiser
?
<EOS>
You
repeated
to
yourself
this
morning
the
brief
scene
of
last
night
?
 
<EOS>
Cover
your
face
and
be
ashamed
!
<EOS>
He
said
something
in
praise
of
your
eyes
,
did
he
?
<EOS>
Blind
puppy
!
<EOS>
Open
their
bleared
lids
and
look
on
your
own
accursed
senselessness
!
<EOS>
It
does
good
to
no
woman
to
be
flattered
by
her
superior
,
who
can
not
possibly
intend
to
marry
her
;
and
it
is
madness
in
all
women
to
let
a
secret
love
kindle
within
them
,
which
,
if
unreturned
and
unknown
,
must
devour
the
life
that
feeds
it
;
and
,
if
discovered
and
responded
to
,
must
lead
,
_
ignis
-
fatus_-like
,
into
miry
wilds
<EOS>
whence
there
is
no
extrication
.
  
<EOS>
"
Listen
,
then
,
Jane
Eyre
,
to
your
sentence
:
to
-
morrow
,
place
the
glass
before
you
,
and
draw
in
chalk
your
own
picture
,
faithfully
,
without
softening
one
defect
;
omit
no
harsh
line
,
smooth
away
no
displeasing
irregularity
;
write
under
it
,
"
Portrait
of
a
Governess
,
disconnected
,
poor
,
and
plain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Afterwards
,
take
a
piece
of
smooth
ivory
 
<EOS>
you
have
one
prepared
in
your
drawing
-
box
:
take
your
palette
,
mix
your
freshest
,
finest
,
clearest
tints
;
choose
your
most
delicate
camel
-
hair
pencils
;
delineate
carefully
the
loveliest
face
you
can
imagine
;
paint
it
in
your
softest
shades
and
sweetest
lines
,
according
to
the
description
given
by
Mrs.
Fairfax
of
Blanche
Ingram
;
remember
the
raven
ringlets
,
the
oriental
eye
;
 
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
you
revert
to
Mr.
Rochester
as
a
model
!
<EOS>
Order
!
<EOS>
No
snivel
!
 
<EOS>
no
sentiment
!
 
<EOS>
no
regret
!
<EOS>
I
will
endure
only
sense
and
resolution
.
<EOS>
Recall
the
august
yet
harmonious
lineaments
,
the
Grecian
neck
and
bust
;
let
the
round
and
dazzling
arm
be
visible
,
and
the
delicate
hand
;
omit
neither
diamond
ring
nor
gold
bracelet
;
portray
faithfully
the
attire
,
aerial
lace
and
glistening
satin
,
graceful
scarf
and
golden
rose
;
call
it
"
Blanche
,
an
accomplished
lady
of
rank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whenever
,
in
future
,
you
should
chance
to
fancy
Mr.
Rochester
thinks
well
of
you
,
take
out
these
two
pictures
and
compare
them
:
say
,
"
Mr.
Rochester
might
probably
win
that
noble
lady
's
love
,
if
he
chose
to
strive
for
it
;
is
it
likely
he
would
waste
a
serious
thought
on
this
indigent
and
insignificant
plebeian
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
'll
do
it
,
"
I
resolved
:
and
having
framed
this
determination
,
I
grew
calm
,
and
fell
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
I
kept
my
word
.
<EOS>
An
hour
or
two
sufficed
to
sketch
my
own
portrait
in
crayons
;
and
in
less
than
a
fortnight
I
had
completed
an
ivory
miniature
of
an
imaginary
Blanche
Ingram
.
<EOS>
It
looked
a
lovely
face
enough
,
and
when
compared
with
the
real
head
in
chalk
,
the
contrast
was
as
great
as
self-
control
could
desire
.
<EOS>
I
derived
benefit
from
the
task
:
it
had
kept
my
head
and
hands
employed
,
and
had
given
force
and
fixedness
to
the
new
impressions
I
wished
to
stamp
indelibly
on
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
I
had
reason
to
congratulate
myself
on
the
course
of
wholesome
discipline
to
which
I
had
thus
forced
my
feelings
to
submit
.
<EOS>
Thanks
to
it
,
I
was
able
to
meet
subsequent
occurrences
with
a
decent
calm
,
which
,
had
they
found
me
unprepared
,
I
should
probably
have
been
unequal
to
maintain
,
even
externally
.
    
<EOS>
A
week
passed
,
and
no
news
arrived
of
Mr.
Rochester
:
ten
days
,
and
still
he
did
not
come
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
said
she
should
not
be
surprised
if
he
were
to
go
straight
from
the
Leas
to
London
,
and
thence
to
the
Continent
,
and
not
show
his
face
again
at
Thornfield
for
a
year
to
come
;
he
had
not
unfrequently
quitted
it
in
a
manner
quite
as
abrupt
and
unexpected
.
<EOS>
When
I
heard
this
,
I
was
beginning
to
feel
a
strange
chill
and
failing
at
the
heart
.
<EOS>
I
was
actually
permitting
myself
to
experience
a
sickening
sense
of
disappointment
;
but
rallying
my
wits
,
and
recollecting
my
principles
,
I
at
once
called
my
sensations
to
order
;
and
it
was
wonderful
how
I
got
over
the
temporary
blunder
 
<EOS>
how
I
cleared
up
the
mistake
of
supposing
Mr.
Rochester
's
movements
a
matter
in
which
I
had
any
cause
to
take
a
vital
interest
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
humbled
myself
by
a
slavish
notion
of
inferiority
:
on
the
contrary
,
I
just
said
    
"
You
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
master
of
Thornfield
,
further
than
to
receive
the
salary
he
gives
you
for
teaching
his
protegee
,
and
to
be
grateful
for
such
respectful
and
kind
treatment
as
,
if
you
do
your
duty
,
you
have
a
right
to
expect
at
his
hands
.
<EOS>
Be
sure
that
is
the
only
tie
he
seriously
acknowledges
between
you
and
him
;
so
do
n't
make
him
the
object
of
your
fine
feelings
,
your
raptures
,
agonies
,
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
of
your
order
:
keep
to
your
caste
,
and
be
too
self
-
respecting
to
lavish
the
love
of
the
whole
heart
,
soul
,
and
strength
,
where
such
a
gift
is
not
wanted
and
would
be
despised
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
went
on
with
my
day
's
business
tranquilly
;
but
ever
and
anon
vague
suggestions
kept
wandering
across
my
brain
of
reasons
why
I
should
quit
Thornfield
;
and
I
kept
involuntarily
framing
advertisements
and
pondering
conjectures
about
new
situations
:
these
thoughts
I
did
not
think
to
check
;
they
might
germinate
and
bear
fruit
if
they
could
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
had
been
absent
upwards
of
a
fortnight
,
when
the
post
brought
Mrs.
Fairfax
a
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
from
the
master
,
"
said
she
,
as
she
looked
at
the
direction
.
<EOS>
"
Now
I
suppose
we
shall
know
whether
we
are
to
expect
his
return
or
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
while
she
broke
the
seal
and
perused
the
document
,
I
went
on
taking
my
coffee
(
we
were
at
breakfast
)
:
<EOS>
it
was
hot
,
and
I
attributed
to
that
circumstance
a
fiery
glow
which
suddenly
rose
to
my
face
.
<EOS>
Why
my
hand
shook
,
and
why
I
involuntarily
spilt
half
the
contents
of
my
cup
into
my
saucer
,
I
did
not
choose
to
consider
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
sometimes
think
we
are
too
quiet
;
but
we
run
a
chance
of
being
busy
enough
now
:
for
a
little
while
at
least
,
"
said
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
still
holding
the
note
before
her
spectacles
.
  
<EOS>
Ere
I
permitted
myself
to
request
an
explanation
,
I
tied
the
string
of
Adele
's
pinafore
,
which
happened
to
be
loose
:
having
helped
her
also
to
another
bun
and
refilled
her
mug
with
milk
,
I
said
,
nonchalantly
    
"
Mr.
Rochester
is
not
likely
to
return
soon
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Indeed
he
is
 
in
three
days
,
he
says
:
that
will
be
next
Thursday
;
and
not
alone
either
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
many
of
the
fine
people
at
the
Leas
are
coming
with
him
:
he
sends
directions
for
all
the
best
bedrooms
to
be
prepared
;
and
the
library
and
drawing
-
rooms
are
to
be
cleaned
out
;
I
am
to
get
more
kitchen
hands
from
the
George
Inn
,
at
Millcote
,
and
from
wherever
else
I
can
;
and
the
ladies
will
bring
their
maids
and
the
gentlemen
their
valets
:
so
we
shall
have
a
full
house
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Fairfax
swallowed
her
breakfast
and
hastened
away
to
commence
operations
.
  
<EOS>
The
three
days
were
,
as
she
had
foretold
,
busy
enough
.
<EOS>
I
had
thought
all
the
rooms
at
Thornfield
beautifully
clean
and
well
arranged
;
but
it
appears
I
was
mistaken
.
<EOS>
Three
women
were
got
to
help
;
and
such
scrubbing
,
such
brushing
,
such
washing
of
paint
and
beating
of
carpets
,
such
taking
down
and
putting
up
of
pictures
,
such
polishing
of
mirrors
and
lustres
,
such
lighting
of
fires
in
bedrooms
,
such
airing
of
sheets
and
feather
-
beds
on
hearths
,
I
never
beheld
,
either
before
or
since
.
<EOS>
Adele
ran
quite
wild
in
the
midst
of
it
:
the
preparations
for
company
and
the
prospect
of
their
arrival
,
seemed
to
throw
her
into
ecstasies
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
Sophie
to
look
over
all
her
"
toilettes
,
"
as
she
called
frocks
;
to
furbish
up
any
that
were
"
_
passees
_
,
"
and
to
air
and
arrange
the
new
.
<EOS>
For
herself
,
she
did
nothing
but
caper
about
in
the
front
chambers
,
jump
on
and
off
the
bedsteads
,
and
lie
on
the
mattresses
and
piled
-
up
bolsters
and
pillows
before
the
enormous
fires
roaring
in
the
chimneys
.
<EOS>
From
school
duties
she
was
exonerated
:
Mrs.
Fairfax
had
pressed
me
into
her
service
,
and
I
was
all
day
in
the
storeroom
,
helping
(
or
hindering
)
<EOS>
her
and
the
cook
<EOS>
;
learning
to
make
custards
and
cheese
-
cakes
and
French
pastry
,
to
truss
game
and
garnish
desert
-
dishes
.
  
<EOS>
The
party
were
expected
to
arrive
on
Thursday
afternoon
,
in
time
for
dinner
at
six
.
<EOS>
During
the
intervening
period
I
had
no
time
to
nurse
chimeras
;
and
I
believe
I
was
as
active
and
gay
as
anybody
 
Adele
excepted
.
<EOS>
Still
,
now
and
then
,
I
received
a
damping
check
to
my
cheerfulness
;
and
was
,
in
spite
of
myself
,
thrown
back
on
the
region
of
doubts
and
portents
,
and
dark
conjectures
.
<EOS>
This
was
when
I
chanced
to
see
the
third
-
storey
staircase
door
(
which
of
late
had
always
been
kept
locked
)
open
slowly
,
and
give
passage
to
the
form
of
Grace
Poole
,
in
prim
cap
,
white
apron
,
and
handkerchief
;
when
I
watched
her
glide
along
the
gallery
,
her
quiet
tread
muffled
in
a
list
slipper
;
when
I
saw
her
look
into
the
bustling
,
topsy
-
turvy
bedrooms
,
 
just
say
a
word
,
perhaps
,
to
the
charwoman
about
the
proper
way
to
polish
a
grate
,
or
clean
a
marble
mantelpiece
,
or
take
stains
from
papered
walls
,
and
then
pass
on
.
<EOS>
She
would
thus
descend
to
the
kitchen
once
a
day
,
eat
her
dinner
,
smoke
a
moderate
pipe
on
the
hearth
,
and
go
back
,
carrying
her
pot
of
porter
with
her
,
for
her
private
solace
,
in
her
own
gloomy
,
upper
haunt
.
<EOS>
Only
one
hour
in
the
twenty
-
four
did
she
pass
with
her
fellow
-
servants
below
;
all
the
rest
of
her
time
was
spent
in
some
low
-
ceiled
,
oaken
chamber
of
the
second
storey
:
there
she
sat
and
sewed
 
and
probably
laughed
drearily
to
herself
,
 
as
companionless
as
a
prisoner
in
his
dungeon
.
  
<EOS>
The
strangest
thing
of
all
was
,
that
not
a
soul
in
the
house
,
except
me
,
noticed
her
habits
,
or
seemed
to
marvel
at
them
:
no
one
discussed
her
position
or
employment
;
no
one
pitied
her
solitude
or
isolation
.
<EOS>
I
once
,
indeed
,
overheard
part
of
a
dialogue
between
Leah
and
one
of
the
charwomen
,
of
which
Grace
formed
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Leah
had
been
saying
something
I
had
not
caught
,
and
the
charwoman
remarked
    
"
She
gets
good
wages
,
I
guess
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Leah
;
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
as
good
;
not
that
mine
are
to
complain
of
,
 
<EOS>
there
's
no
stinginess
at
Thornfield
;
but
they
're
not
one
fifth
of
the
sum
Mrs.
Poole
receives
.
<EOS>
And
she
is
laying
by
<EOS>
:
she
goes
every
quarter
to
the
bank
at
Millcote
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
wonder
but
she
has
saved
enough
to
keep
her
independent
if
she
liked
to
leave
;
but
I
suppose
she
's
got
used
to
the
place
;
and
then
she
's
not
forty
yet
,
and
strong
and
able
for
anything
.
<EOS>
It
is
too
soon
for
her
to
give
up
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
good
hand
,
I
daresay
,
"
said
the
charwoman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
she
understands
what
she
has
to
do
,
 
<EOS>
nobody
better
,
"
rejoined
Leah
significantly
;
"
and
it
is
not
every
one
could
fill
her
shoes
 
not
for
all
the
money
she
gets
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
it
is
not
!
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
the
master
 
"
  
The
charwoman
was
going
on
;
but
here
Leah
turned
and
perceived
me
,
and
she
instantly
gave
her
companion
a
nudge
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
n't
she
know
?
<EOS>
"
I
heard
the
woman
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
Leah
shook
her
head
,
and
the
conversation
was
of
course
dropped
.
<EOS>
All
I
had
gathered
from
it
amounted
to
this
,
 
that
there
was
a
mystery
at
Thornfield
;
and
that
from
participation
in
that
mystery
I
was
purposely
excluded
.
  
<EOS>
Thursday
came
:
all
work
had
been
completed
the
previous
evening
;
carpets
were
laid
down
,
bed
-
hangings
festooned
,
radiant
white
counterpanes
spread
,
toilet
tables
arranged
,
furniture
rubbed
,
flowers
piled
in
vases
:
both
chambers
and
saloons
looked
as
fresh
and
bright
as
hands
could
make
them
.
<EOS>
The
hall
,
too
,
was
scoured
;
and
the
great
carved
clock
,
as
well
as
the
steps
and
banisters
of
the
staircase
,
were
polished
to
the
brightness
of
glass
;
in
the
dining
-
room
,
the
sideboard
flashed
resplendent
with
plate
;
in
the
drawing
-
room
and
boudoir
,
vases
of
exotics
bloomed
on
all
sides
.
  
<EOS>
Afternoon
arrived
:
Mrs.
Fairfax
assumed
her
best
black
satin
gown
,
her
gloves
,
and
her
gold
watch
;
for
it
was
her
part
to
receive
the
company
,
 
to
conduct
the
ladies
to
their
rooms
,
&
c.
Adele
<EOS>
,
too
,
would
be
dressed
:
though
I
thought
she
had
little
chance
of
being
introduced
to
the
party
that
day
at
least
.
<EOS>
However
,
to
please
her
,
I
allowed
Sophie
to
apparel
her
in
one
of
her
short
,
full
muslin
frocks
.
<EOS>
For
myself
,
I
had
no
need
to
make
any
change
;
I
should
not
be
called
upon
to
quit
my
sanctum
of
the
schoolroom
;
for
a
sanctum
it
was
now
become
to
me
,
 
"
a
very
pleasant
refuge
in
time
of
trouble
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
had
been
a
mild
,
serene
spring
day
 
one
of
those
days
which
,
towards
the
end
of
March
or
the
beginning
of
April
,
rise
shining
over
the
earth
as
heralds
of
summer
.
<EOS>
It
was
drawing
to
an
end
now
;
but
the
evening
was
even
warm
,
and
I
sat
at
work
in
the
schoolroom
with
the
window
open
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
gets
late
,
"
said
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
entering
in
rustling
state
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
I
ordered
dinner
an
hour
after
the
time
Mr.
Rochester
mentioned
;
for
it
is
past
six
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
sent
John
down
to
the
gates
to
see
if
there
is
anything
on
the
road
:
one
can
see
a
long
way
from
thence
in
the
direction
of
Millcote
.
<EOS>
"
She
went
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
Here
he
is
!
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
John
"
(
leaning
out
)
,
"
any
news
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
coming
,
ma'am
,
"
was
the
answer
.
<EOS>
"
They
'll
be
here
in
ten
minutes
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adele
flew
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
I
followed
,
taking
care
to
stand
on
one
side
,
so
that
,
screened
by
the
curtain
,
I
could
see
without
being
seen
.
  
<EOS>
The
ten
minutes
John
had
given
seemed
very
long
,
but
at
last
wheels
were
heard
;
four
equestrians
galloped
up
the
drive
,
and
after
them
came
two
open
carriages
.
<EOS>
Fluttering
veils
and
waving
plumes
filled
the
vehicles
<EOS>
;
two
of
the
cavaliers
were
young
,
dashing
-
looking
gentlemen
;
the
third
was
Mr.
Rochester
,
on
his
black
horse
,
Mesrour
,
Pilot
bounding
before
him
;
at
his
side
rode
a
lady
,
and
he
and
she
were
the
first
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
Her
purple
riding
-
habit
almost
swept
the
ground
,
her
veil
streamed
long
on
the
breeze
;
mingling
with
its
transparent
folds
,
and
gleaming
through
them
,
shone
rich
raven
ringlets
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Ingram
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
and
away
she
hurried
to
her
post
below
.
  
<EOS>
The
cavalcade
,
following
the
sweep
of
the
drive
,
quickly
turned
the
angle
of
the
house
,
and
I
lost
sight
of
it
.
<EOS>
Adele
now
petitioned
to
go
down
;
but
I
took
her
on
my
knee
,
and
gave
her
to
understand
that
she
must
not
on
any
account
think
of
venturing
in
sight
of
the
ladies
,
either
now
or
at
any
other
time
,
unless
expressly
sent
for
:
that
Mr.
Rochester
would
be
very
angry
,
&
c.
"
<EOS>
Some
natural
tears
she
shed
"
on
being
told
this
;
<EOS>
but
as
I
began
to
look
very
grave
,
she
consented
at
last
to
wipe
them
.
  
<EOS>
A
joyous
stir
was
now
audible
in
the
hall
:
gentlemen
's
deep
tones
and
ladies
'
silvery
accents
blent
harmoniously
together
,
and
distinguishable
above
all
,
though
not
loud
,
was
the
sonorous
voice
of
the
master
of
Thornfield
Hall
,
welcoming
his
fair
and
gallant
guests
under
its
roof
.
<EOS>
Then
light
steps
ascended
the
stairs
;
and
there
was
a
tripping
through
the
gallery
,
and
soft
cheerful
laughs
,
and
opening
and
closing
doors
,
and
,
for
a
time
,
a
hush
.
  
<EOS>
"
Elles
changent
de
toilettes
,
"
said
Adele
;
who
,
listening
attentively
,
had
followed
every
movement
;
and
she
sighed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Chez
maman
,
"
said
she
,
"
quand
il
y
avait
<EOS>
du
monde
,
je
le
suivais
partout
,
au
salon
et
a
leurs
chambres
;
souvent
je
regardais
les
femmes
de
chambre
coiffer
et
habiller
les
dames
,
et
c'etait
<EOS>
si
<EOS>
amusant
:
<EOS>
comme
cela
on
apprend
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
you
feel
hungry
,
Adele
?
"
  
"
Mais
oui
,
mademoiselle
:
voila
cinq
ou
six
heures
que
nous
n'avons
pas
mange
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
now
,
while
the
ladies
are
in
their
rooms
,
I
will
venture
down
and
get
you
something
to
eat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
issuing
from
my
asylum
with
precaution
,
I
sought
a
back
-
stairs
which
conducted
directly
to
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
All
in
that
region
was
fire
and
commotion
;
the
soup
and
fish
were
in
the
last
stage
of
projection
,
and
the
cook
hung
over
her
crucibles
in
a
frame
of
mind
and
body
threatening
spontaneous
combustion
.
<EOS>
In
the
servants
'
hall
two
coachmen
and
three
gentlemen
's
gentlemen
stood
or
sat
round
the
fire
;
the
abigails
,
I
suppose
,
were
upstairs
with
their
mistresses
;
the
new
servants
,
that
had
been
hired
from
Millcote
,
were
bustling
about
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Threading
this
chaos
,
I
at
last
reached
the
larder
;
there
I
took
possession
of
a
cold
chicken
,
a
roll
of
bread
,
some
tarts
,
a
plate
or
two
and
a
knife
and
fork
:
with
this
booty
<EOS>
I
made
a
hasty
retreat
.
<EOS>
I
had
regained
the
gallery
,
and
was
just
shutting
the
back
-
door
behind
me
,
when
an
accelerated
hum
warned
me
that
the
ladies
were
about
to
issue
from
their
chambers
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
proceed
to
the
schoolroom
without
passing
some
of
their
doors
,
and
running
the
risk
of
being
surprised
with
my
cargo
of
victualage
;
so
I
stood
still
at
this
end
,
which
,
being
windowless
,
was
dark
:
quite
dark
now
,
for
the
sun
was
set
and
twilight
gathering
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
the
chambers
gave
up
their
fair
tenants
one
after
another
:
each
came
out
gaily
and
airily
,
with
dress
that
gleamed
lustrous
through
the
dusk
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
they
stood
grouped
together
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
gallery
,
conversing
in
a
key
of
sweet
subdued
vivacity
:
they
then
descended
the
staircase
almost
as
noiselessly
as
a
bright
mist
rolls
down
a
hill
.
<EOS>
Their
collective
appearance
had
left
on
me
an
impression
of
high-
born
elegance
,
such
as
I
had
never
before
received
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
Adele
peeping
through
the
schoolroom
door
,
which
she
held
ajar
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
beautiful
ladies
!
"
cried
she
in
English
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
wish
I
might
go
to
them
!
<EOS>
Do
you
think
Mr.
Rochester
will
send
for
us
by
-
and
-
bye
,
after
dinner
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
I
do
n't
;
Mr.
Rochester
has
something
else
to
think
about
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
the
ladies
to
-
night
;
perhaps
you
will
see
them
to
-
morrow
:
here
is
your
dinner
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
really
hungry
,
so
the
chicken
and
tarts
served
to
divert
her
attention
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
<EOS>
I
secured
this
forage
,
or
both
she
,
I
,
and
Sophie
,
to
whom
I
conveyed
a
share
of
our
repast
,
would
have
run
a
chance
of
getting
no
dinner
at
all
:
every
one
downstairs
was
too
much
engaged
to
think
of
us
.
<EOS>
The
dessert
was
not
carried
out
till
after
nine
and
at
ten
footmen
were
still
running
to
and
fro
with
trays
and
coffee-
cups
.
<EOS>
I
allowed
Adele
to
sit
up
much
later
than
usual
;
for
she
declared
she
could
not
possibly
go
to
sleep
while
the
doors
kept
opening
and
shutting
below
,
and
people
bustling
about
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
she
added
,
a
message
might
possibly
come
from
Mr.
Rochester
when
she
was
undressed
;
"
et
alors
quel
dommage
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
told
her
stories
as
long
as
she
would
listen
to
them
;
and
then
for
a
change
I
took
her
out
into
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
The
hall
lamp
was
now
lit
,
and
it
amused
her
to
look
over
the
balustrade
and
watch
the
servants
passing
backwards
and
forwards
.
<EOS>
When
the
evening
was
far
advanced
,
a
sound
of
music
issued
from
the
drawing
-
room
,
whither
the
piano
had
been
removed
;
Adele
and
I
sat
down
on
the
top
step
of
the
stairs
to
listen
.
<EOS>
Presently
a
voice
blent
with
the
rich
tones
of
the
instrument
;
it
was
a
lady
who
sang
,
and
very
sweet
her
notes
were
.
<EOS>
The
solo
over
,
a
duet
followed
,
and
then
a
glee
:
a
joyous
conversational
murmur
filled
up
the
intervals
.
<EOS>
I
listened
long
:
suddenly
I
discovered
that
my
ear
was
wholly
intent
on
analysing
the
mingled
sounds
,
and
trying
to
discriminate
amidst
the
confusion
of
accents
those
of
Mr.
Rochester
;
and
when
it
caught
them
,
which
it
soon
did
,
it
found
a
further
task
in
framing
the
tones
,
rendered
by
distance
inarticulate
,
into
words
.
  
<EOS>
The
clock
struck
eleven
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
Adele
,
whose
head
leant
against
my
shoulder
;
her
eyes
were
waxing
heavy
,
so
I
took
her
up
in
my
arms
and
carried
her
off
to
bed
.
<EOS>
It
was
near
one
before
the
gentlemen
and
ladies
sought
their
chambers
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
was
as
fine
as
its
predecessor
:
it
was
devoted
by
the
party
to
an
excursion
to
some
site
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
They
set
out
early
in
the
forenoon
,
some
on
horseback
,
the
rest
in
carriages
;
I
witnessed
both
the
departure
and
the
return
.
<EOS>
Miss
Ingram
,
as
before
,
was
the
only
lady
equestrian
;
and
,
as
before
,
Mr.
Rochester
galloped
at
her
side
;
the
two
rode
a
little
apart
from
the
rest
.
<EOS>
I
pointed
out
this
circumstance
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
who
was
standing
at
the
window
with
me
    
<EOS>
"
You
said
it
was
not
likely
they
should
think
of
being
married
,
"
said
I
,
"
<EOS>
but
you
see
Mr.
Rochester
evidently
prefers
her
to
any
of
the
other
ladies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
daresay
:
no
doubt
he
admires
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
she
him
,
"
I
added
;
"
look
how
she
leans
her
head
towards
him
as
if
she
were
conversing
confidentially
;
I
wish
I
could
see
her
face
;
I
have
never
had
a
glimpse
of
it
yet
.
"
  
"
You
will
see
her
this
evening
,
"
answered
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
I
happened
to
remark
to
Mr.
Rochester
how
much
Adele
wished
to
be
introduced
to
the
ladies
,
and
he
said
:
"
Oh
!
let
her
come
into
the
drawing
-
room
after
dinner
;
and
request
Miss
Eyre
to
accompany
her
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
he
said
that
from
mere
politeness
:
I
need
not
go
,
I
am
sure
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
observed
to
him
that
as
you
were
unused
to
company
,
I
did
not
think
you
would
like
appearing
before
so
gay
a
party
 
<EOS>
all
strangers
;
and
he
replied
,
in
his
quick
way
 
"
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
If
she
objects
,
tell
her
it
is
my
particular
wish
;
and
if
she
resists
,
say
I
shall
come
and
fetch
her
in
case
of
contumacy
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
will
not
give
him
that
trouble
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
,
if
no
better
may
be
;
but
I
do
n't
like
it
.
<EOS>
Shall
you
be
there
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
pleaded
off
,
and
he
admitted
my
plea
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
how
to
manage
so
as
to
avoid
the
embarrassment
of
making
a
formal
entrance
,
which
is
the
most
disagreeable
part
of
the
business
.
<EOS>
You
must
go
into
the
drawing-
room
while
it
is
empty
,
before
the
ladies
leave
the
dinner
-
table
;
choose
your
seat
in
any
quiet
nook
you
like
;
you
need
not
stay
long
after
the
gentlemen
come
in
,
unless
you
please
:
just
let
Mr.
Rochester
see
you
are
there
and
then
slip
away
 
nobody
will
notice
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
these
people
remain
long
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Perhaps
two
or
three
weeks
,
certainly
not
more
.
<EOS>
After
the
Easter
recess
,
Sir
George
Lynn
,
who
was
lately
elected
member
for
Millcote
,
will
have
to
go
up
to
town
and
take
his
seat
;
I
daresay
Mr.
Rochester
will
accompany
him
:
it
surprises
me
that
he
has
already
made
so
protracted
a
stay
at
Thornfield
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
with
some
trepidation
that
I
perceived
the
hour
approach
when
I
was
to
repair
with
my
charge
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Adele
had
been
in
a
state
of
ecstasy
all
day
,
after
hearing
she
was
to
be
presented
to
the
ladies
in
the
evening
;
and
it
was
not
till
Sophie
commenced
the
operation
of
dressing
her
that
she
sobered
down
.
<EOS>
Then
the
importance
of
the
process
quickly
steadied
her
,
and
by
the
time
she
had
her
curls
arranged
in
well
-
smoothed
,
drooping
clusters
,
her
pink
satin
frock
put
on
,
her
long
sash
tied
,
and
her
lace
mittens
adjusted
,
she
looked
as
grave
as
any
judge
.
<EOS>
No
need
to
warn
her
not
to
disarrange
her
attire
<EOS>
:
when
she
was
dressed
,
she
sat
demurely
down
in
her
little
chair
,
taking
care
previously
to
lift
up
the
satin
skirt
for
fear
she
should
crease
it
,
and
assured
me
she
would
not
stir
thence
till
I
was
ready
.
<EOS>
This
I
quickly
was
:
my
best
dress
(
the
silver
-
grey
one
,
purchased
for
Miss
Temple
's
wedding
,
and
never
worn
since
)
was
soon
put
on
;
my
hair
was
soon
smoothed
;
my
sole
ornament
,
the
pearl
brooch
,
soon
assumed
.
<EOS>
We
descended
.
  
<EOS>
Fortunately
there
was
another
entrance
to
the
drawing
-
room
than
that
through
the
saloon
where
they
were
all
seated
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
We
found
the
apartment
vacant
;
a
large
fire
burning
silently
on
the
marble
hearth
,
and
wax
candles
shining
in
bright
solitude
,
amid
the
exquisite
flowers
with
which
the
tables
were
adorned
.
<EOS>
The
crimson
curtain
hung
before
the
arch
:
slight
as
was
the
separation
<EOS>
this
drapery
formed
from
the
party
in
the
adjoining
saloon
,
they
spoke
in
so
low
a
key
that
nothing
of
their
conversation
could
be
distinguished
beyond
a
soothing
murmur
.
  
<EOS>
Adele
,
who
appeared
to
be
still
under
the
influence
of
a
most
solemnising
impression
,
sat
down
,
without
a
word
,
on
the
footstool
<EOS>
I
pointed
out
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
retired
to
a
window
-
seat
,
and
taking
a
book
from
a
table
near
,
endeavoured
to
read
.
<EOS>
Adele
brought
her
stool
to
my
feet
;
ere
long
she
touched
my
knee
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
Adele
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Est
-
ce
que
je
<EOS>
ne
puis
pas
prendrie
une
seule
de
ces
fleurs
magnifiques
,
mademoiselle
?
<EOS>
Seulement
pour
completer
ma
toilette
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
too
much
of
your
"
toilette
,
"
Adele
:
but
you
may
have
a
flower
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
took
a
rose
from
a
vase
and
fastened
it
in
her
sash
.
<EOS>
She
sighed
a
sigh
of
ineffable
satisfaction
,
as
if
her
cup
of
happiness
were
now
full
.
<EOS>
I
turned
my
face
away
to
conceal
a
smile
I
could
not
suppress
:
there
was
something
ludicrous
as
well
as
painful
in
the
little
Parisienne
's
earnest
and
innate
devotion
to
matters
of
dress
.
  
<EOS>
A
soft
sound
of
rising
now
became
audible
;
the
curtain
was
swept
back
from
the
arch
;
through
it
appeared
the
dining
-
room
,
with
its
lit
lustre
pouring
down
light
on
the
silver
and
glass
of
a
magnificent
dessert
-
service
covering
a
long
table
;
a
band
of
ladies
stood
in
the
opening
;
they
entered
,
and
the
curtain
fell
behind
them
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
but
eight
;
yet
,
somehow
,
as
they
flocked
in
,
they
gave
the
impression
of
a
much
larger
number
.
<EOS>
Some
of
them
were
very
tall
;
many
were
dressed
in
white
;
and
all
had
a
sweeping
amplitude
of
array
that
seemed
to
magnify
their
persons
as
a
mist
magnifies
the
moon
.
<EOS>
I
rose
and
curtseyed
to
them
:
one
or
two
bent
their
heads
in
return
,
the
others
only
stared
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
They
dispersed
about
the
room
,
reminding
me
,
by
the
lightness
and
buoyancy
of
their
movements
,
of
a
flock
of
white
plumy
birds
.
<EOS>
Some
of
them
threw
themselves
in
half
-
reclining
positions
on
the
sofas
and
ottomans
:
some
bent
over
the
tables
and
examined
the
flowers
and
books
:
the
rest
gathered
in
a
group
round
the
fire
:
all
talked
in
a
low
but
clear
tone
which
seemed
habitual
to
them
.
<EOS>
I
knew
their
names
afterwards
,
and
may
as
well
mention
them
now
.
  
<EOS>
First
,
there
was
Mrs.
Eshton
and
two
of
her
daughters
.
<EOS>
She
had
evidently
been
a
handsome
woman
,
and
was
well
preserved
still
.
<EOS>
Of
her
daughters
,
the
eldest
,
Amy
,
was
rather
little
:
naive
,
and
child
-
like
in
face
and
manner
,
and
piquant
in
form
;
her
white
muslin
dress
and
blue
sash
became
her
well
.
<EOS>
The
second
,
Louisa
,
was
taller
and
more
elegant
in
figure
;
with
a
very
pretty
face
,
of
that
order
the
French
term
_
minois
chiffone
_
:
both
sisters
were
fair
as
lilies
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Lynn
was
a
large
and
stout
personage
of
about
forty
,
very
erect
,
very
haughty
-
looking
,
richly
dressed
in
a
satin
robe
of
changeful
sheen
:
her
dark
hair
shone
glossily
under
the
shade
of
an
azure
plume
,
and
within
the
circlet
of
a
band
of
gems
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Colonel
Dent
was
less
showy
;
but
,
I
thought
,
more
lady
-
like
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
slight
figure
,
a
pale
,
gentle
face
,
and
fair
hair
.
<EOS>
Her
black
satin
dress
,
her
scarf
of
rich
foreign
lace
,
and
her
pearl
ornaments
,
pleased
me
better
than
the
rainbow
radiance
of
the
titled
dame
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
three
most
distinguished
 
partly
,
perhaps
,
because
the
tallest
figures
of
the
band
 
were
the
Dowager
Lady
Ingram
and
her
daughters
,
Blanche
and
Mary
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
three
of
the
loftiest
stature
of
women
.
<EOS>
The
Dowager
might
be
between
forty
and
fifty
:
her
shape
was
still
fine
;
her
hair
(
by
candle
-
light
at
least
)
still
black
;
her
teeth
,
too
,
were
still
apparently
perfect
.
<EOS>
Most
people
would
have
termed
her
a
splendid
woman
of
her
age
:
and
so
she
was
,
no
doubt
,
physically
speaking
;
but
then
there
was
an
expression
of
almost
insupportable
haughtiness
in
her
bearing
and
countenance
.
<EOS>
She
had
Roman
features
and
a
double
chin
,
disappearing
into
a
throat
like
a
pillar
:
these
features
appeared
to
me
not
only
inflated
and
darkened
,
but
even
furrowed
with
pride
;
and
the
chin
was
sustained
by
the
same
principle
,
in
a
position
of
almost
preternatural
erectness
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
likewise
,
a
fierce
and
a
hard
eye
:
it
reminded
me
of
Mrs.
Reed
's
;
she
mouthed
her
words
in
speaking
;
her
voice
was
deep
,
its
inflections
very
pompous
,
very
dogmatical
,
 
very
intolerable
,
in
short
.
<EOS>
A
crimson
velvet
robe
,
and
a
shawl
turban
of
some
gold
-
wrought
Indian
fabric
,
invested
her
<EOS>
(
I
suppose
she
thought
)
with
a
truly
imperial
dignity
.
  
<EOS>
Blanche
and
Mary
were
of
equal
stature
,
 
straight
and
tall
as
poplars
.
<EOS>
Mary
was
too
slim
for
her
height
,
but
Blanche
was
moulded
like
a
Dian
.
<EOS>
I
regarded
her
,
of
course
,
with
special
interest
.
<EOS>
First
,
I
wished
to
see
whether
her
appearance
accorded
with
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
description
;
secondly
,
whether
it
at
all
resembled
the
fancy
miniature
I
had
painted
of
her
;
and
thirdly
 
it
will
out
!
 
<EOS>
whether
it
were
such
as
I
should
fancy
likely
to
suit
Mr.
Rochester
's
taste
.
  
<EOS>
As
far
as
person
went
,
she
answered
point
for
point
,
both
to
my
picture
and
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
description
.
<EOS>
The
noble
bust
,
the
sloping
shoulders
,
the
graceful
neck
,
the
dark
eyes
and
black
ringlets
were
all
there
;
 
but
her
face
?
<EOS>
Her
face
was
like
her
mother
's
;
a
youthful
unfurrowed
likeness
:
the
same
low
brow
,
the
same
high
features
,
the
same
pride
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
,
however
,
so
saturnine
a
pride
!
<EOS>
she
laughed
continually
;
her
laugh
was
satirical
,
and
so
was
the
habitual
expression
of
her
arched
and
haughty
lip
.
  
<EOS>
Genius
is
said
to
be
self
-
conscious
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
whether
Miss
Ingram
was
a
genius
,
but
she
was
self
-
conscious
 
remarkably
self
-
conscious
indeed
.
<EOS>
She
entered
into
a
discourse
on
botany
with
the
gentle
Mrs.
Dent
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
Mrs.
Dent
had
not
studied
that
science
:
though
,
as
she
said
,
she
liked
flowers
,
"
especially
wild
ones
;
"
Miss
Ingram
had
,
and
she
ran
over
its
vocabulary
with
an
air
.
<EOS>
I
presently
perceived
she
was
(
what
is
vernacularly
termed
)
<EOS>
_
trailing
_
Mrs.
Dent
;
that
is
,
playing
on
her
ignorance
 
<EOS>
her
_
trail
_
might
be
clever
,
but
it
was
decidedly
not
good-
natured
.
<EOS>
She
played
:
her
execution
was
brilliant
;
she
sang
:
her
voice
was
fine
;
she
talked
French
apart
to
her
mamma
;
and
she
talked
it
well
,
with
fluency
and
with
a
good
accent
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
had
a
milder
and
more
open
countenance
than
Blanche
;
softer
features
too
,
and
a
skin
some
shades
fairer
<EOS>
(
Miss
Ingram
was
dark
as
a
Spaniard
)
 
<EOS>
but
Mary
was
deficient
in
life
<EOS>
:
her
face
lacked
expression
,
her
eye
lustre
;
she
had
nothing
to
say
,
and
having
once
taken
her
seat
,
remained
fixed
like
a
statue
in
its
niche
.
<EOS>
The
sisters
were
both
attired
in
spotless
white
.
  
<EOS>
And
did
I
now
think
Miss
Ingram
<EOS>
such
a
choice
as
Mr.
Rochester
would
be
likely
to
make
?
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
 
I
did
not
know
his
taste
in
female
beauty
.
<EOS>
If
he
liked
the
majestic
,
she
was
the
very
type
of
majesty
:
then
she
was
accomplished
,
sprightly
.
<EOS>
Most
gentlemen
would
admire
her
,
I
thought
;
and
that
he
_
did
_
admire
her
,
I
already
seemed
to
have
obtained
proof
:
to
remove
the
last
shade
of
doubt
,
it
remained
but
to
see
them
together
.
  
<EOS>
You
are
not
to
suppose
,
reader
,
that
Adele
has
all
this
time
been
sitting
motionless
on
the
stool
at
my
feet
:
<EOS>
no
;
when
the
ladies
entered
,
she
rose
,
advanced
to
meet
them
,
made
a
stately
reverence
,
and
said
with
gravity
    
"
Bon
jour
,
mesdames
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
Miss
Ingram
had
looked
down
at
her
with
a
mocking
air
,
and
exclaimed
,
"
Oh
,
what
a
little
puppet
!
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Lynn
had
remarked
,
"
It
is
Mr.
Rochester
's
ward
,
I
suppose
 
the
little
French
girl
he
was
speaking
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dent
had
kindly
taken
her
hand
,
and
given
her
a
kiss
.
  
<EOS>
Amy
and
Louisa
Eshton
had
cried
out
simultaneously
 
"
What
a
love
of
a
child
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
then
they
had
called
her
to
a
sofa
,
where
she
now
sat
,
ensconced
between
them
,
chattering
alternately
in
French
and
broken
English
;
absorbing
not
only
the
young
ladies
'
attention
,
but
that
of
Mrs.
Eshton
and
Lady
Lynn
,
and
getting
spoilt
to
her
heart
's
content
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
coffee
is
brought
in
,
and
the
gentlemen
are
summoned
.
<EOS>
I
sit
in
the
shade
 
<EOS>
if
any
shade
there
be
in
this
brilliantly
-
lit
apartment
;
the
window
-
curtain
half
hides
me
.
<EOS>
Again
the
arch
yawns
;
they
come
.
<EOS>
The
collective
appearance
of
the
gentlemen
,
like
that
of
the
ladies
,
is
very
imposing
:
they
are
all
costumed
in
black
;
most
of
them
are
tall
,
some
young
.
<EOS>
Henry
and
Frederick
Lynn
are
very
dashing
sparks
indeed
;
and
Colonel
Dent
is
a
fine
soldierly
man
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Eshton
,
the
magistrate
of
the
district
,
is
gentleman
-
like
:
his
hair
is
quite
white
,
his
eyebrows
and
whiskers
still
dark
,
which
gives
him
something
of
the
appearance
of
a
"
pere
noble
de
theatre
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Ingram
,
like
his
sisters
,
is
very
tall
;
like
them
,
also
,
he
is
handsome
;
but
he
shares
Mary
's
apathetic
and
listless
look
:
he
seems
to
have
more
length
of
limb
than
vivacity
of
blood
or
vigour
of
brain
.
  
<EOS>
And
where
is
Mr.
Rochester
?
  
<EOS>
He
comes
in
last
<EOS>
:
I
am
not
looking
at
the
arch
,
yet
I
see
him
enter
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
concentrate
my
attention
on
those
netting
-
needles
,
on
the
meshes
of
the
purse
<EOS>
I
am
forming
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
think
only
of
the
work
I
have
in
my
hands
,
to
see
only
the
silver
beads
and
silk
threads
that
lie
in
my
lap
;
whereas
,
I
distinctly
behold
his
figure
,
and
I
inevitably
recall
the
moment
when
I
last
saw
it
;
just
after
I
had
rendered
him
,
what
he
deemed
,
an
essential
service
,
and
<EOS>
he
,
holding
my
hand
,
and
looking
down
on
my
face
,
surveyed
me
with
eyes
that
revealed
a
heart
full
and
eager
to
overflow
;
in
whose
emotions
I
had
a
part
.
<EOS>
How
near
had
I
approached
him
at
that
moment
!
<EOS>
What
had
occurred
since
,
calculated
to
change
his
and
my
relative
positions
?
<EOS>
Yet
now
,
how
distant
,
how
far
estranged
we
were
!
<EOS>
So
far
estranged
,
that
I
did
not
expect
him
to
come
and
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
wonder
,
when
,
without
looking
at
me
,
he
took
a
seat
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
,
and
began
conversing
with
some
of
the
ladies
.
  
<EOS>
No
sooner
did
I
see
that
his
attention
was
riveted
on
them
,
and
that
I
might
gaze
without
being
observed
,
than
my
eyes
were
drawn
involuntarily
to
his
face
;
I
could
not
keep
their
lids
under
control
:
they
would
rise
,
and
the
irids
would
fix
on
him
.
<EOS>
I
looked
,
and
had
an
acute
pleasure
in
looking
,
 
a
precious
yet
poignant
pleasure
;
pure
gold
,
with
a
steely
point
of
agony
:
a
pleasure
like
what
the
thirst
-
perishing
man
might
feel
who
knows
the
well
to
which
he
has
crept
is
poisoned
,
yet
stoops
and
drinks
divine
draughts
nevertheless
.
  
<EOS>
Most
true
is
it
that
"
beauty
is
in
the
eye
of
the
gazer
.
<EOS>
"
My
master
's
colourless
,
olive
face
,
square
,
massive
brow
,
broad
and
jetty
eyebrows
,
deep
eyes
,
strong
features
,
firm
,
grim
mouth
,
 
all
energy
,
decision
,
will
,
 
were
not
beautiful
,
according
to
rule
;
but
they
were
more
than
beautiful
to
me
;
they
were
full
of
an
interest
,
an
influence
that
quite
mastered
me
,
 
that
took
my
feelings
from
my
own
power
and
fettered
them
in
his
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
intended
to
love
him
;
the
reader
knows
I
had
wrought
hard
to
extirpate
from
my
soul
the
germs
of
love
there
detected
;
and
now
,
at
the
first
renewed
view
of
him
,
they
spontaneously
arrived
,
green
and
strong
!
<EOS>
He
made
me
love
him
without
looking
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
compared
him
with
his
guests
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
gallant
grace
of
the
Lynns
,
the
languid
elegance
of
Lord
Ingram
,
 
even
the
military
distinction
of
Colonel
Dent
,
contrasted
with
his
look
of
native
pith
and
genuine
power
?
<EOS>
I
had
no
sympathy
in
their
appearance
,
their
expression
:
yet
I
could
imagine
that
most
observers
would
call
them
attractive
,
handsome
,
imposing
;
while
they
would
pronounce
Mr.
Rochester
at
once
harsh
-
featured
and
melancholy
-
looking
.
<EOS>
I
saw
them
smile
,
laugh
 
<EOS>
it
was
nothing
;
the
light
of
the
candles
had
as
much
soul
in
it
as
their
smile
;
the
tinkle
of
the
bell
as
much
significance
as
their
laugh
.
<EOS>
I
saw
Mr.
Rochester
smile
:
 
his
stern
features
softened
;
his
eye
grew
both
brilliant
and
gentle
,
its
ray
both
searching
and
sweet
.
<EOS>
He
was
talking
,
at
the
moment
,
to
Louisa
and
Amy
Eshton
.
<EOS>
I
wondered
to
see
them
receive
with
calm
that
look
which
seemed
to
me
so
penetrating
:
<EOS>
I
expected
their
eyes
to
fall
,
their
colour
to
rise
under
it
;
yet
I
was
glad
when
I
found
they
were
in
no
sense
moved
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
not
to
them
what
he
is
to
me
,
"
I
thought
:
"
he
is
not
of
their
kind
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
is
of
mine
;
 
I
am
sure
he
is
 
<EOS>
I
feel
akin
to
him
 
<EOS>
I
understand
the
language
of
his
countenance
and
movements
:
though
rank
and
wealth
sever
us
widely
,
I
have
something
in
my
brain
and
heart
,
in
my
blood
and
nerves
,
that
assimilates
me
mentally
to
him
.
<EOS>
Did
I
say
,
a
few
days
since
,
that
I
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
but
to
receive
my
salary
at
his
hands
?
<EOS>
Did
I
forbid
myself
to
think
of
him
in
any
other
light
than
as
a
paymaster
?
<EOS>
Blasphemy
against
nature
!
<EOS>
Every
good
,
true
,
vigorous
feeling
I
have
gathers
impulsively
round
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
must
conceal
my
sentiments
:
I
must
smother
hope
;
I
must
remember
that
he
can
not
care
much
for
me
.
<EOS>
For
when
I
say
that
I
am
of
his
kind
,
I
do
not
mean
that
I
have
his
force
to
influence
,
and
his
spell
to
attract
<EOS>
;
I
mean
only
that
I
have
certain
tastes
and
feelings
in
common
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
must
,
then
,
repeat
continually
that
we
are
for
ever
sundered
:
 
and
yet
,
while
I
breathe
and
think
,
I
must
love
him
.

<EOS>
Coffee
is
handed
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
,
since
the
gentlemen
entered
,
have
become
lively
as
larks
;
conversation
waxes
brisk
and
merry
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Dent
and
Mr.
Eshton
argue
on
politics
;
their
wives
listen
.
<EOS>
The
two
proud
dowagers
,
Lady
Lynn
and
Lady
Ingram
,
confabulate
together
.
<EOS>
Sir
George
 
<EOS>
whom
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
I
have
forgotten
to
describe
,
 
a
very
big
,
and
very
fresh
-
looking
country
gentleman
,
<EOS>
stands
before
their
sofa
,
coffee-
cup
in
hand
,
and
occasionally
puts
in
a
word
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Frederick
Lynn
has
taken
a
seat
beside
Mary
Ingram
,
and
is
showing
her
the
engravings
of
a
splendid
volume
:
she
looks
,
smiles
now
and
then
,
but
apparently
says
little
.
<EOS>
The
tall
and
phlegmatic
Lord
Ingram
leans
with
folded
arms
on
the
chair
-
back
of
the
little
and
lively
Amy
Eshton
;
she
glances
up
at
him
,
and
chatters
like
a
wren
:
she
likes
him
better
than
she
does
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
Henry
Lynn
has
taken
possession
of
an
ottoman
at
the
feet
of
Louisa
:
<EOS>
Adele
shares
it
with
him
:
he
is
trying
to
talk
French
with
her
,
and
Louisa
laughs
at
his
blunders
.
<EOS>
With
whom
will
Blanche
Ingram
pair
?
<EOS>
She
is
standing
alone
at
the
table
,
bending
gracefully
over
an
album
.
<EOS>
She
seems
waiting
to
be
sought
;
but
she
will
not
wait
too
long
:
she
herself
selects
a
mate
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
,
having
quitted
the
Eshtons
,
stands
on
the
hearth
as
solitary
as
she
stands
by
the
table
:
she
confronts
him
,
taking
her
station
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
mantelpiece
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rochester
,
I
thought
you
were
not
fond
of
children
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nor
am
I.
"
  
"
Then
,
what
induced
you
to
take
charge
of
such
a
little
doll
as
that
?
"
<EOS>
(
pointing
to
Adele
)
.
<EOS>
"
Where
did
you
pick
her
up
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
pick
her
up
;
she
was
left
on
my
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
sent
her
to
school
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
afford
it
:
schools
are
so
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
suppose
you
have
a
governess
for
her
:
I
saw
a
person
with
her
just
now
 
<EOS>
is
she
gone
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
there
she
is
still
,
behind
the
window-
curtain
.
<EOS>
You
pay
her
,
of
course
;
I
should
think
it
quite
as
expensive
,
 
more
so
;
for
you
have
them
both
to
keep
in
addition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
feared
 
or
<EOS>
should
I
say
,
hoped
?
 
<EOS>
the
allusion
to
me
would
make
Mr.
Rochester
glance
my
way
;
and
I
involuntarily
shrank
farther
into
the
shade
:
but
he
never
turned
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
considered
the
subject
,
"
said
he
indifferently
,
looking
straight
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
you
men
never
do
consider
economy
and
common
sense
.
<EOS>
You
should
hear
mama
on
the
chapter
of
governesses
:
<EOS>
Mary
and
I
have
had
,
I
should
think
,
a
dozen
at
least
in
our
day
;
half
of
them
detestable
and
the
rest
ridiculous
,
and
all
incubi
 
were
they
not
,
mama
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
speak
,
my
own
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
young
lady
thus
claimed
as
the
dowager
's
special
property
,
reiterated
her
question
with
an
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
,
do
n't
mention
governesses
;
the
word
makes
me
nervous
.
<EOS>
I
have
suffered
a
martyrdom
from
their
incompetency
and
caprice
.
<EOS>
I
thank
Heaven
I
have
now
done
with
them
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dent
here
bent
over
to
the
pious
lady
and
whispered
something
in
her
ear
;
I
suppose
,
from
the
answer
elicited
,
it
was
a
reminder
that
one
of
the
anathematised
race
was
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tant
pis
!
<EOS>
"
said
her
Ladyship
,
"
I
hope
it
may
do
her
good
!
"
<EOS>
Then
,
in
a
lower
tone
,
but
still
loud
enough
for
me
to
hear
,
"
I
noticed
her
;
I
am
a
judge
of
physiognomy
,
and
in
hers
I
see
all
the
faults
of
her
class
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
they
,
madam
?
"
inquired
Mr.
Rochester
aloud
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
in
your
private
ear
,
"
replied
she
,
wagging
her
turban
three
times
with
portentous
significancy
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
my
curiosity
will
be
past
its
appetite
;
it
craves
food
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
Blanche
;
she
is
nearer
you
than
I.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
refer
him
to
me
,
mama
!
<EOS>
I
have
just
one
word
to
say
of
the
whole
tribe
;
they
are
a
nuisance
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
ever
suffered
much
from
them
;
I
took
care
to
turn
the
tables
.
<EOS>
What
tricks
Theodore
<EOS>
and
I
used
to
play
on
our
Miss
Wilsons
,
and
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greys
,
and
Madame
Jouberts
!
<EOS>
Mary
was
always
too
sleepy
to
join
in
a
plot
with
spirit
.
<EOS>
The
best
fun
was
with
Madame
Joubert
:
<EOS>
Miss
Wilson
was
a
poor
sickly
thing
,
lachrymose
and
low-
<EOS>
spirited
,
not
worth
the
trouble
of
vanquishing
,
in
short
;
and
Mrs.
Grey
was
coarse
and
insensible
;
no
blow
took
effect
on
her
.
<EOS>
But
poor
Madame
Joubert
!
<EOS>
I
see
her
yet
in
her
raging
passions
,
when
we
had
driven
her
to
extremities
 
spilt
our
tea
,
crumbled
our
bread
and
butter
,
tossed
our
books
up
to
the
ceiling
,
and
played
a
charivari
with
the
ruler
and
desk
,
the
fender
and
fire
-
irons
.
<EOS>
Theodore
,
do
you
remember
those
merry
days
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yaas
,
to
be
sure
I
do
,
"
drawled
Lord
Ingram
;
"
and
the
poor
old
stick
used
to
cry
out
"
<EOS>
Oh
you
villains
childs
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
we
sermonised
her
on
the
presumption
of
attempting
to
teach
such
clever
blades
as
we
were
,
when
she
was
herself
so
ignorant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
did
;
and
,
Tedo
,
you
know
,
I
helped
you
in
prosecuting
(
or
persecuting
)
<EOS>
your
tutor
,
whey
-
faced
Mr.
Vining
 
<EOS>
the
parson
in
the
pip
,
as
we
used
to
call
him
.
<EOS>
He
and
Miss
Wilson
took
the
liberty
of
falling
in
love
with
each
other
 
at
least
Tedo
<EOS>
and
I
thought
so
;
we
surprised
sundry
tender
glances
and
sighs
which
we
interpreted
as
tokens
of
"
la
belle
passion
,
"
and
I
promise
you
the
public
soon
had
the
benefit
of
our
discovery
;
we
employed
it
as
a
sort
of
lever
to
hoist
our
dead
-
weights
from
the
house
.
<EOS>
Dear
mama
,
there
,
as
soon
as
she
got
an
inkling
of
the
business
,
found
out
that
it
was
of
an
immoral
tendency
.
<EOS>
Did
you
not
,
my
lady
-
mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
my
best
.
<EOS>
And
I
was
quite
right
:
depend
on
that
:
there
are
a
thousand
reasons
why
liaisons
between
governesses
and
tutors
should
never
be
tolerated
a
moment
in
any
well
-
regulated
house
;
firstly
 
"
  
"
Oh
,
gracious
,
mama
!
<EOS>
Spare
us
the
enumeration
!
<EOS>
_
Au
reste
_
<EOS>
,
we
all
know
them
:
danger
of
bad
example
to
innocence
of
childhood
;
distractions
and
consequent
neglect
of
duty
on
the
part
of
the
attached
 
mutual
alliance
and
reliance
;
confidence
thence
resulting
 
insolence
accompanying
 
mutiny
and
general
blow
-
up
.
<EOS>
Am
I
right
,
Baroness
Ingram
,
of
Ingram
Park
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lily
-
flower
,
you
are
right
now
,
as
always
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
no
more
need
be
said
:
change
the
subject
.
"
  
<EOS>
Amy
Eshton
,
not
hearing
or
not
heeding
this
dictum
,
joined
in
with
her
soft
,
infantine
tone
:
<EOS>
"
Louisa
and
I
used
to
quiz
our
governess
too
;
but
she
was
such
a
good
creature
,
she
would
bear
anything
:
nothing
put
her
out
.
<EOS>
She
was
never
cross
with
us
;
was
she
,
Louisa
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
never
:
we
might
do
what
we
pleased
;
ransack
her
desk
and
her
workbox
,
and
turn
her
drawers
inside
out
;
and
she
was
so
good
-
natured
,
she
would
give
us
anything
we
asked
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
now
,
"
said
Miss
Ingram
,
curling
her
lip
sarcastically
,
"
we
shall
have
an
abstract
of
the
memoirs
of
all
the
governesses
extant
:
in
order
to
avert
such
a
visitation
,
I
again
move
the
introduction
of
a
new
topic
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
,
do
you
second
my
motion
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
I
support
you
on
this
point
,
as
on
every
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
on
me
be
the
onus
of
bringing
it
forward
.
<EOS>
Signior
Eduardo
,
are
you
in
voice
to
-
night
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Donna
Bianca
,
if
you
command
it
,
I
will
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
signior
,
I
lay
on
you
my
sovereign
behest
to
furbish
up
your
lungs
and
other
vocal
organs
,
as
they
will
be
wanted
on
my
royal
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
would
not
be
the
Rizzio
of
so
divine
a
Mary
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
fig
for
Rizzio
!
"
<EOS>
cried
she
,
tossing
her
head
with
all
its
curls
,
as
she
moved
to
the
piano
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
opinion
the
fiddler
David
must
have
been
an
insipid
sort
of
fellow
;
I
like
black
Bothwell
better
:
to
my
mind
a
man
is
nothing
without
a
spice
of
the
devil
in
him
;
and
history
may
say
what
it
will
of
James
Hepburn
,
but
I
have
a
notion
,
he
was
just
the
sort
of
wild
,
fierce
,
bandit
hero
whom
I
could
have
consented
to
gift
with
my
hand
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
you
hear
!
<EOS>
Now
which
of
you
most
resembles
Bothwell
?
"
cried
Mr.
Rochester
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
the
preference
lies
with
you
,
"
responded
Colonel
Dent
.
  
<EOS>
"
On
my
honour
,
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
,
"
was
the
reply
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Ingram
,
who
had
now
seated
herself
with
proud
grace
at
the
piano
,
spreading
out
her
snowy
robes
in
queenly
amplitude
,
commenced
a
brilliant
prelude
;
talking
meantime
.
<EOS>
She
appeared
to
be
on
her
high
horse
to
-
night
;
both
her
words
and
her
air
seemed
intended
to
excite
not
only
the
admiration
,
but
the
amazement
of
her
auditors
:
she
was
evidently
bent
on
striking
them
as
something
very
dashing
and
daring
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
am
so
sick
of
the
young
men
of
the
present
day
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
she
,
rattling
away
at
the
instrument
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Poor
,
puny
things
,
not
fit
to
stir
a
step
beyond
papa
's
park
gates
:
nor
to
go
even
so
far
without
mama
's
permission
and
guardianship
!
<EOS>
Creatures
so
absorbed
in
care
about
their
pretty
faces
,
and
their
white
hands
,
and
their
small
feet
;
as
if
a
man
had
anything
to
do
with
beauty
!
<EOS>
As
if
loveliness
were
not
the
special
prerogative
of
woman
 
<EOS>
her
legitimate
appanage
and
heritage
!
<EOS>
I
grant
an
ugly
_
woman
<EOS>
_
is
a
blot
on
the
fair
face
of
creation
;
but
as
to
the
_
gentlemen
_
,
let
them
be
solicitous
to
possess
only
strength
and
valour
:
let
their
motto
be
:
 
Hunt
,
shoot
,
and
fight
:
the
rest
is
not
worth
a
fillip
.
<EOS>
Such
should
be
my
device
,
were
I
a
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whenever
I
marry
,
"
she
continued
after
a
pause
which
none
interrupted
,
"
I
am
resolved
my
husband
shall
not
be
a
rival
,
but
a
foil
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
suffer
no
competitor
near
the
throne
;
I
shall
exact
an
undivided
homage
:
his
devotions
shall
not
be
shared
between
me
and
the
shape
he
sees
in
his
mirror
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
,
now
sing
,
and
I
will
play
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
all
obedience

"
was
the
response
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
then
is
a
Corsair
-
song
.
<EOS>
Know
that
I
doat
on
Corsairs
;
and
for
that
reason
,
sing
it
_
con
spirito
<EOS>
_

<EOS>
"
  
"
Commands
from
Miss
Ingram
's
lips
would
put
spirit
into
a
mug
of
milk
and
water
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
care
,
then
:
if
you
do
n't
please
me
,
I
will
shame
you
by
showing
how
such
things
_
should
_
be
done

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
offering
a
premium
on
incapacity
:
I
shall
now
endeavour
to
fail
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gardez
-
vous

<EOS>
If
you
err
wilfully
,
I
shall
devise
a
proportionate
punishment
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Miss
Ingram
ought
to
be
clement
,
for
she
has
it
in
her
power
to
inflict
a
chastisement
beyond
mortal
endurance
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ha
!
explain
!
"
commanded
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
madam
:
<EOS>
no
need
of
explanation
;
your
own
fine
sense
must
inform
you
that
one
of
your
frowns
would
be
a
sufficient
substitute
for
capital
punishment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sing
!
"
said
she
,
and
again
touching
the
piano
,
she
commenced
an
accompaniment
in
spirited
style
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
is
my
time
to
slip
away
,
"
thought
I
:
but
the
tones
that
then
severed
the
air
arrested
me
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
had
said
Mr.
Rochester
possessed
a
fine
voice
:
he
did
 
a
mellow
,
powerful
bass
,
into
which
he
threw
his
own
feeling
,
his
own
force
;
finding
a
way
through
the
ear
to
the
heart
,
and
there
waking
sensation
strangely
.
<EOS>
I
waited
till
the
last
deep
and
full
vibration
<EOS>
had
expired
 
till
the
tide
of
talk
,
checked
an
instant
,
<EOS>
had
resumed
its
flow
;
I
then
quitted
my
sheltered
corner
and
made
my
exit
by
the
side
-
door
,
which
was
fortunately
near
.
<EOS>
Thence
a
narrow
passage
led
into
the
hall
:
in
crossing
it
,
I
perceived
my
sandal
was
loose
;
I
stopped
to
tie
it
,
kneeling
down
for
that
purpose
on
the
mat
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
.
<EOS>
I
heard
the
dining
-
room
door
unclose
;
a
gentleman
came
out
;
rising
hastily
<EOS>
,
I
stood
face
to
face
with
him
:
it
was
Mr.
Rochester
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
well
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
not
come
and
speak
to
me
in
the
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
I
might
have
retorted
the
question
on
him
who
put
it
:
but
I
would
not
take
that
freedom
.
<EOS>
I
answered
    
"
I
did
not
wish
to
disturb
you
,
as
you
seemed
engaged
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
been
doing
during
my
absence
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
particular
;
teaching
Adele
as
usual
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
getting
a
good
deal
paler
than
you
were
 
as
I
saw
at
first
sight
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
at
all
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
take
any
cold
<EOS>
that
night
you
half
drowned
me
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
the
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Return
to
the
drawing
-
room
:
<EOS>
you
are
deserting
too
early
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
tired
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
for
a
minute
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
a
little
depressed
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
about
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
 
nothing
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
depressed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
affirm
that
you
are
:
so
much
depressed
that
a
few
more
words
would
bring
tears
to
your
eyes
 
indeed
,
they
are
there
now
,
shining
and
swimming
;
and
a
bead
has
slipped
from
the
lash
and
fallen
on
to
the
flag
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
time
,
and
was
not
in
mortal
dread
of
some
prating
prig
of
a
servant
passing
,
I
would
know
what
all
this
means
.
<EOS>
Well
,
to
-
night
<EOS>
I
excuse
you
;
but
understand
that
so
long
as
my
visitors
stay
,
I
expect
you
to
appear
in
the
drawing
-
room
every
evening
;
it
is
my
wish
;
do
n't
neglect
it
.
<EOS>
Now
go
,
and
send
Sophie
for
Adele
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
my
 
"
He
stopped
,
bit
his
lip
,
and
abruptly
left
me
.
    
<EOS>
Merry
days
were
these
at
Thornfield
Hall
;
and
busy
days
too
<EOS>
:
how
different
from
the
first
three
months
of
stillness
,
monotony
,
and
solitude
I
had
passed
beneath
its
roof
!
<EOS>
All
sad
feelings
seemed
now
driven
from
the
house
,
all
gloomy
associations
forgotten
:
there
was
life
everywhere
,
movement
all
day
long
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
now
traverse
the
gallery
,
once
so
hushed
,
nor
enter
the
front
chambers
,
once
so
tenantless
,
without
encountering
a
smart
lady's
-
maid
or
a
dandy
valet
.
  
<EOS>
The
kitchen
,
the
butler
's
pantry
,
the
servants
'
hall
,
the
entrance
hall
,
were
equally
alive
;
and
the
saloons
were
only
left
void
and
still
when
the
blue
sky
and
halcyon
sunshine
of
the
genial
spring
weather
called
their
occupants
out
into
the
grounds
.
<EOS>
Even
when
that
weather
was
broken
,
and
continuous
rain
set
in
for
some
days
,
no
damp
seemed
cast
over
enjoyment
:
indoor
amusements
only
became
more
lively
and
varied
,
in
consequence
of
the
stop
put
to
outdoor
gaiety
.
  
<EOS>
I
wondered
what
they
were
going
to
do
the
first
evening
a
change
of
entertainment
was
proposed
:
they
spoke
of
"
playing
charades
,
"
but
in
my
ignorance
I
did
not
understand
the
term
.
<EOS>
The
servants
were
called
in
,
the
dining
-
room
tables
wheeled
away
,
the
lights
otherwise
disposed
,
the
chairs
placed
in
a
semicircle
opposite
the
arch
.
<EOS>
While
Mr.
Rochester
and
the
other
gentlemen
directed
these
alterations
,
the
ladies
were
running
up
and
<EOS>
down
stairs
ringing
for
their
maids
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
was
summoned
to
give
information
respecting
the
resources
of
the
house
in
shawls
,
dresses
,
draperies
of
any
kind
;
and
certain
wardrobes
of
the
third
storey
were
ransacked
,
and
their
contents
,
in
the
shape
of
brocaded
and
hooped
petticoats
,
satin
sacques
,
black
modes
,
lace
lappets
,
&
c.
,
were
brought
down
in
armfuls
by
the
abigails
;
then
a
selection
was
made
,
and
such
things
as
were
chosen
were
carried
to
the
boudoir
within
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Meantime
,
Mr.
Rochester
had
again
summoned
the
ladies
round
him
,
and
was
selecting
certain
of
their
number
to
be
of
his
party
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Ingram
is
mine
,
of
course
,
"
said
he
:
<EOS>
afterwards
he
named
the
two
Misses
Eshton
,
and
Mrs.
Dent
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
:
<EOS>
I
happened
to
be
near
him
,
as
I
had
been
fastening
the
clasp
of
Mrs.
Dent
's
bracelet
,
which
had
got
loose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
play
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
insist
,
which
I
rather
feared
he
would
have
done
;
he
allowed
me
to
return
quietly
to
my
usual
seat
.
  
<EOS>
He
and
his
aids
now
withdrew
behind
the
curtain
:
the
other
party
,
which
was
headed
by
Colonel
Dent
,
sat
down
on
the
crescent
of
chairs
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
gentlemen
,
Mr.
Eshton
,
observing
me
,
seemed
to
propose
that
I
should
be
asked
to
join
them
;
but
Lady
Ingram
instantly
negatived
the
notion
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
I
heard
her
say
:
"
<EOS>
she
looks
too
stupid
for
any
game
of
the
sort
.
"
  
<EOS>
Ere
long
a
bell
tinkled
,
and
the
curtain
drew
up
.
<EOS>
Within
the
arch
,
the
bulky
figure
of
Sir
George
Lynn
,
whom
Mr.
Rochester
had
likewise
chosen
,
was
seen
enveloped
in
a
white
sheet
:
before
him
,
on
a
table
,
lay
open
a
large
book
;
and
at
his
side
stood
Amy
Eshton
,
draped
in
Mr.
Rochester
's
cloak
,
and
holding
a
book
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Somebody
,
unseen
,
rang
the
bell
merrily
;
then
Adele
(
who
had
insisted
on
being
one
of
her
guardian
's
party
)
,
bounded
forward
,
scattering
round
her
the
contents
of
a
basket
of
flowers
she
carried
on
her
arm
.
<EOS>
Then
appeared
the
magnificent
figure
of
Miss
Ingram
,
clad
in
white
,
a
long
veil
on
her
head
,
and
a
wreath
of
roses
round
her
brow
;
by
her
side
walked
Mr.
Rochester
,
and
together
they
drew
near
the
table
.
<EOS>
They
knelt
;
while
Mrs.
Dent
and
Louisa
Eshton
,
dressed
also
in
white
,
took
up
their
stations
behind
them
.
<EOS>
A
ceremony
followed
,
in
dumb
show
,
in
which
it
was
easy
to
recognise
the
pantomime
of
a
marriage
.
<EOS>
At
its
termination
,
Colonel
Dent
and
his
party
consulted
in
whispers
for
two
minutes
,
then
the
Colonel
called
out
    
"
Bride
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
bowed
,
and
the
curtain
fell
.
  
<EOS>
A
considerable
interval
elapsed
before
it
again
rose
.
<EOS>
Its
second
rising
displayed
a
more
elaborately
prepared
scene
than
the
last
.
<EOS>
The
drawing-
room
,
as
I
have
before
observed
,
was
raised
two
steps
above
the
dining-
room
,
and
on
the
top
of
the
upper
step
,
placed
a
yard
or
two
back
within
the
room
,
appeared
a
large
marble
basin
 
which
I
recognised
as
an
ornament
of
the
conservatory
 
where
it
usually
stood
,
surrounded
by
exotics
,
and
tenanted
by
gold
fish
 
and
whence
it
must
have
been
transported
with
some
trouble
,
on
account
of
its
size
and
weight
.
  
<EOS>
Seated
on
the
carpet
,
by
the
side
of
this
basin
,
was
seen
Mr.
Rochester
,
costumed
in
shawls
,
with
a
turban
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
His
dark
eyes
and
swarthy
skin
and
Paynim
features
suited
the
costume
exactly
:
he
looked
the
very
model
of
an
Eastern
emir
,
an
agent
or
a
victim
of
the
bowstring
.
<EOS>
Presently
advanced
into
view
Miss
Ingram
.
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
was
attired
in
oriental
fashion
:
a
crimson
scarf
tied
sash
-
like
round
the
waist
:
an
embroidered
handkerchief
knotted
about
her
temples
;
her
beautifully
-
moulded
arms
bare
,
one
of
them
upraised
in
the
act
of
supporting
a
pitcher
,
poised
gracefully
on
her
head
.
<EOS>
Both
her
cast
of
form
and
feature
,
her
complexion
and
her
general
air
,
suggested
the
idea
of
some
Israelitish
princess
of
the
patriarchal
days
;
and
such
was
doubtless
the
character
she
intended
to
represent
.
  
<EOS>
She
approached
the
basin
,
and
bent
over
it
as
if
to
fill
her
pitcher
;
she
again
lifted
it
to
her
head
.
<EOS>
The
personage
on
the
well
-
brink
now
seemed
to
accost
her
;
to
make
some
request
:
 
<EOS>
"
She
hasted
,
let
down
her
pitcher
on
her
hand
,
and
gave
him
to
drink
.
"
<EOS>
From
the
bosom
of
his
robe
he
then
produced
a
casket
,
opened
it
and
showed
magnificent
bracelets
and
earrings
;
she
acted
astonishment
and
admiration
;
kneeling
,
he
laid
the
treasure
at
her
feet
;
incredulity
and
delight
were
expressed
by
her
looks
and
gestures
;
the
stranger
fastened
the
bracelets
on
her
arms
and
the
rings
in
her
ears
.
<EOS>
It
was
Eliezer
and
Rebecca
:
the
camels
only
were
wanting
.
  
<EOS>
The
divining
party
again
laid
their
heads
together
:
apparently
they
could
not
agree
about
the
word
or
syllable
the
scene
illustrated
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Dent
,
their
spokesman
,
demanded
"
the
tableau
of
the
whole
;
"
whereupon
the
curtain
again
descended
.
  
<EOS>
On
its
third
rising
only
a
portion
of
the
drawing
-
room
was
disclosed
;
the
rest
being
concealed
by
a
screen
,
hung
with
some
sort
of
dark
and
coarse
drapery
.
<EOS>
The
marble
basin
was
removed
;
in
its
place
,
stood
a
deal
table
and
a
kitchen
chair
:
these
objects
were
visible
by
a
very
dim
light
proceeding
from
a
horn
lantern
,
the
wax
candles
being
all
extinguished
.
  
<EOS>
Amidst
this
sordid
scene
,
sat
a
man
with
his
clenched
hands
resting
on
his
knees
,
and
his
eyes
bent
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
I
knew
Mr.
Rochester
;
though
the
begrimed
face
,
the
disordered
dress
(
his
coat
hanging
loose
from
one
arm
,
as
if
it
had
been
almost
torn
from
his
back
in
a
scuffle
)
,
the
desperate
and
scowling
countenance
,
the
rough
,
bristling
hair
might
well
have
disguised
him
.
<EOS>
As
he
moved
,
a
chain
clanked
;
to
his
wrists
were
attached
fetters
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bridewell
!
"
exclaimed
Colonel
Dent
,
and
the
charade
was
solved
.
  
<EOS>
A
sufficient
interval
having
elapsed
for
the
performers
to
resume
their
ordinary
costume
,
they
re
-
entered
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
led
in
Miss
Ingram
;
she
was
complimenting
him
on
his
acting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
"
said
she
,
"
that
,
of
the
three
characters
,
I
liked
you
in
the
last
best
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
had
you
but
lived
a
few
years
earlier
,
what
a
gallant
gentleman
-
highwayman
you
would
have
made
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
all
the
soot
washed
from
my
face
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
turning
it
towards
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
yes
:
the
more
's
the
pity
!
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
becoming
to
your
complexion
than
that
ruffian
's
rouge
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
would
like
a
hero
of
the
road
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
An
English
hero
of
the
road
would
be
the
next
best
thing
to
an
Italian
bandit
;
and
that
could
only
be
surpassed
by
a
Levantine
pirate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
whatever
I
am
,
remember
you
are
my
wife
;
we
were
married
an
hour
since
,
in
the
presence
of
all
these
witnesses
.
"
<EOS>
She
giggled
,
and
her
colour
rose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Dent
<EOS>
,
"
continued
Mr.
Rochester
,
"
it
is
your
turn
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
the
other
party
withdrew
,
he
and
his
band
took
the
vacated
seats
.
<EOS>
Miss
Ingram
placed
herself
at
her
leader
's
right
hand
;
the
other
diviners
filled
the
chairs
on
each
side
of
him
and
her
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
now
watch
the
actors
;
I
no
longer
waited
with
interest
for
the
curtain
to
rise
;
my
attention
was
absorbed
by
the
spectators
;
my
eyes
,
erewhile
fixed
on
the
arch
,
were
now
irresistibly
attracted
to
the
semicircle
of
chairs
.
<EOS>
What
charade
Colonel
Dent
and
his
party
played
,
what
word
they
chose
,
how
they
acquitted
themselves
,
<EOS>
I
no
longer
remember
;
but
I
still
see
the
consultation
which
followed
each
scene
:
I
see
Mr.
Rochester
turn
to
Miss
Ingram
,
and
Miss
Ingram
to
him
;
I
see
her
incline
her
head
towards
him
,
till
the
jetty
curls
almost
touch
his
shoulder
and
wave
against
his
cheek
;
I
hear
their
mutual
whisperings
;
I
recall
their
interchanged
glances
;
and
something
even
of
the
feeling
roused
by
the
spectacle
returns
in
memory
at
this
moment
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
,
reader
,
that
I
had
learnt
to
love
Mr.
Rochester
:
I
could
not
unlove
him
now
,
merely
because
I
found
that
he
had
ceased
to
notice
me
 
because
I
might
pass
hours
in
his
presence
,
and
he
would
never
once
turn
his
eyes
in
my
direction
 
because
I
saw
all
his
attentions
appropriated
by
a
great
lady
,
who
scorned
to
touch
me
with
the
hem
of
her
robes
as
she
passed
;
who
,
if
ever
her
dark
and
imperious
eye
fell
on
me
by
chance
,
would
withdraw
it
instantly
as
from
an
object
too
mean
to
merit
observation
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
unlove
him
,
because
I
felt
sure
he
would
soon
marry
this
very
lady
 
because
I
read
daily
in
her
a
proud
security
in
his
intentions
respecting
her
 
because
I
witnessed
hourly
in
him
a
style
of
courtship
which
,
if
careless
and
choosing
rather
to
be
sought
than
to
seek
,
was
yet
,
in
its
very
carelessness
,
captivating
,
and
in
its
very
pride
,
irresistible
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
to
cool
or
banish
love
in
these
circumstances
,
though
much
to
create
despair
.
<EOS>
Much
too
,
you
will
think
,
reader
,
to
engender
jealousy
:
<EOS>
if
a
woman
,
in
my
position
,
could
presume
to
be
jealous
of
a
woman
in
Miss
Ingram
's
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
not
jealous
:
or
very
rarely
;
 
the
nature
of
the
pain
I
suffered
could
not
be
explained
by
that
word
.
<EOS>
Miss
Ingram
was
a
mark
beneath
jealousy
<EOS>
:
she
was
too
inferior
to
excite
the
feeling
.
<EOS>
Pardon
the
seeming
paradox
<EOS>
;
I
mean
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
showy
,
but
she
was
not
genuine
:
she
had
a
fine
person
,
many
brilliant
attainments
;
but
her
mind
was
poor
,
her
heart
barren
by
nature
:
<EOS>
nothing
bloomed
spontaneously
on
that
soil
;
no
unforced
natural
fruit
delighted
by
its
freshness
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
good
;
she
was
not
original
:
she
used
to
repeat
sounding
phrases
from
books
:
she
never
offered
,
nor
had
,
an
opinion
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
advocated
a
high
tone
of
sentiment
;
but
she
did
not
know
the
sensations
of
sympathy
and
pity
;
tenderness
and
truth
were
not
in
her
.
<EOS>
Too
often
she
betrayed
this
,
by
the
undue
vent
she
gave
to
a
spiteful
antipathy
she
had
conceived
against
little
Adele
:
pushing
her
away
with
some
contumelious
epithet
if
she
happened
to
approach
her
;
sometimes
ordering
her
from
the
room
,
and
always
treating
her
with
coldness
and
acrimony
.
<EOS>
Other
eyes
besides
mine
watched
these
manifestations
of
character
 
watched
them
closely
,
keenly
,
shrewdly
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
the
future
bridegroom
,
Mr.
Rochester
himself
,
exercised
over
his
intended
a
ceaseless
surveillance
;
and
it
was
from
this
sagacity
 
this
guardedness
of
his
 
this
perfect
,
clear
consciousness
of
his
fair
one
's
defects
 
this
obvious
absence
of
passion
in
his
sentiments
towards
her
,
that
my
ever-
<EOS>
torturing
pain
arose
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
he
was
going
to
marry
her
,
for
family
,
perhaps
political
reasons
,
because
her
rank
and
connections
suited
him
;
I
felt
he
had
not
given
her
his
love
,
and
that
her
qualifications
were
ill
adapted
to
win
from
him
that
treasure
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
point
 
<EOS>
this
was
where
the
nerve
was
touched
and
teased
 
<EOS>
this
was
where
the
fever
was
sustained
and
fed
:
<EOS>
_
she
could
not
charm
him
_
.
  
<EOS>
If
she
had
managed
the
victory
at
once
,
and
he
had
yielded
and
sincerely
laid
his
heart
at
her
feet
,
I
should
have
covered
my
face
,
turned
to
the
wall
,
and
(
figuratively
)
have
died
to
them
.
<EOS>
If
Miss
Ingram
had
been
a
good
and
noble
woman
,
endowed
with
force
,
fervour
,
kindness
,
sense
,
I
should
have
had
one
vital
struggle
with
two
tigers
 
jealousy
and
despair
:
then
,
my
heart
torn
out
and
devoured
,
I
should
have
admired
her
 
acknowledged
her
excellence
,
and
been
quiet
for
the
rest
of
my
days
:
and
the
more
absolute
her
superiority
,
the
deeper
would
have
been
my
admiration
 
the
more
truly
tranquil
my
quiescence
.
<EOS>
But
as
matters
really
stood
,
to
watch
Miss
Ingram
's
efforts
at
fascinating
Mr.
Rochester
,
to
witness
their
repeated
failure
 
herself
unconscious
that
they
did
fail
<EOS>
;
vainly
fancying
that
each
shaft
launched
hit
the
mark
,
and
infatuatedly
pluming
herself
on
success
,
when
her
pride
and
self
-
complacency
repelled
further
and
further
what
she
wished
to
allure
 
to
witness
_
<EOS>
this
_
,
was
to
be
at
once
under
ceaseless
excitation
and
ruthless
restraint
.
  
<EOS>
Because
,
when
she
failed
,
I
saw
how
she
might
have
succeeded
.
<EOS>
Arrows
that
continually
glanced
off
from
Mr.
Rochester
's
breast
and
fell
harmless
at
his
feet
,
might
,
I
knew
,
if
shot
by
a
surer
hand
,
have
quivered
keen
in
his
proud
heart
 
have
called
love
into
his
stern
eye
,
and
softness
into
his
sardonic
face
;
or
,
better
still
,
without
weapons
a
silent
conquest
might
have
been
won
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
can
she
not
influence
him
more
,
when
she
is
privileged
to
draw
so
near
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
myself
.
"
<EOS>
Surely
she
can
not
truly
like
him
,
or
not
like
him
with
true
affection
!
<EOS>
If
she
did
,
she
need
not
coin
her
smiles
so
lavishly
,
flash
her
glances
so
unremittingly
,
manufacture
airs
<EOS>
so
elaborate
,
graces
so
multitudinous
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
that
she
might
,
by
merely
sitting
quietly
at
his
side
,
saying
little
and
looking
less
,
get
nigher
his
heart
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
in
his
face
a
far
different
expression
from
that
which
hardens
it
now
while
she
is
so
vivaciously
accosting
him
;
but
then
it
came
of
itself
:
it
was
not
elicited
by
meretricious
arts
and
calculated
manoeuvres
;
and
one
had
but
to
accept
it
 
to
answer
what
he
asked
without
pretension
,
to
address
him
when
needful
without
grimace
 
<EOS>
and
it
increased
and
grew
kinder
and
more
genial
,
and
warmed
one
like
a
fostering
sunbeam
.
<EOS>
How
will
she
manage
to
please
him
when
they
are
married
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
she
will
manage
it
;
and
yet
it
might
be
managed
;
and
his
wife
might
,
I
verily
believe
,
be
the
very
happiest
woman
the
sun
shines
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
said
anything
condemnatory
of
Mr.
Rochester
's
project
of
marrying
for
interest
and
connections
.
<EOS>
It
surprised
me
when
I
first
discovered
that
such
was
his
intention
<EOS>
:
I
had
thought
him
a
man
unlikely
to
be
influenced
by
motives
so
commonplace
in
his
choice
of
a
wife
;
but
the
longer
I
considered
the
position
,
education
,
&
c.
,
of
the
parties
,
the
less
I
felt
justified
in
judging
and
blaming
either
him
or
Miss
Ingram
for
acting
in
conformity
to
ideas
and
principles
instilled
into
them
,
doubtless
,
from
their
childhood
.
<EOS>
All
their
class
held
these
principles
<EOS>
:
I
supposed
,
then
,
they
had
reasons
for
holding
them
such
as
I
could
not
fathom
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
me
that
,
were
I
a
gentleman
like
him
<EOS>
,
I
would
take
to
my
bosom
only
such
a
wife
as
I
could
love
;
but
the
very
obviousness
of
the
advantages
to
the
husband
's
own
happiness
offered
by
this
plan
convinced
me
that
there
must
be
arguments
against
its
general
adoption
of
which
I
was
quite
ignorant
:
otherwise
I
felt
sure
all
the
world
would
act
as
I
wished
to
act
.
  
<EOS>
But
in
other
points
,
as
well
as
this
,
I
was
growing
very
lenient
to
my
master
:
<EOS>
I
was
forgetting
all
his
faults
,
for
which
I
had
once
kept
a
sharp
look
-
out
.
<EOS>
It
had
formerly
been
my
endeavour
to
study
all
sides
of
his
character
:
to
take
the
bad
with
the
good
;
and
from
the
just
weighing
of
both
,
to
form
an
equitable
judgment
.
<EOS>
Now
I
saw
no
bad
.
<EOS>
The
sarcasm
that
had
repelled
,
the
harshness
that
had
startled
me
once
,
were
only
like
keen
condiments
in
a
choice
dish
:
their
presence
was
pungent
,
but
their
absence
would
be
felt
as
comparatively
insipid
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
the
vague
something
 
was
it
a
sinister
or
a
sorrowful
,
<EOS>
a
designing
or
a
desponding
expression
?
 
<EOS>
that
opened
upon
a
careful
observer
,
now
and
then
,
in
his
eye
,
and
closed
again
before
one
could
fathom
the
strange
depth
partially
disclosed
;
<EOS>
that
something
which
used
to
make
me
fear
and
shrink
,
as
if
I
had
been
wandering
amongst
volcanic
-
looking
hills
,
and
had
suddenly
felt
the
ground
quiver
and
seen
it
gape
:
that
something
,
I
,
at
intervals
,
beheld
still
;
and
with
throbbing
heart
,
but
not
with
palsied
nerves
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
wishing
to
shun
,
I
longed
only
to
dare
 
to
divine
it
;
and
I
thought
Miss
Ingram
happy
,
because
one
day
she
might
look
into
the
abyss
at
her
leisure
,
explore
its
secrets
and
analyse
their
nature
.
  
<EOS>
Meantime
,
while
I
thought
only
of
my
master
and
his
future
bride
 
saw
only
them
,
heard
only
their
discourse
,
and
considered
only
their
movements
of
importance
 
the
rest
of
the
party
were
occupied
with
their
own
separate
interests
and
pleasures
.
<EOS>
The
Ladies
Lynn
and
Ingram
continued
to
consort
in
solemn
conferences
,
where
they
nodded
their
two
turbans
at
each
other
,
and
held
up
their
four
hands
in
confronting
gestures
of
surprise
,
or
mystery
,
or
horror
,
according
to
the
theme
on
which
their
gossip
ran
,
like
a
pair
of
magnified
puppets
.
<EOS>
Mild
Mrs.
Dent
talked
with
good
-
natured
Mrs.
Eshton
;
and
the
two
sometimes
bestowed
a
courteous
word
or
smile
on
me
.
<EOS>
Sir
George
Lynn
,
Colonel
Dent
,
and
Mr.
Eshton
discussed
politics
,
or
county
affairs
,
or
justice
business
.
<EOS>
Lord
Ingram
flirted
with
Amy
Eshton
;
Louisa
played
and
sang
to
and
with
one
of
the
Messrs.
Lynn
;
and
Mary
Ingram
listened
languidly
to
the
gallant
speeches
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
all
,
as
with
one
consent
,
suspended
their
by
-
play
to
observe
and
listen
to
the
principal
actors
:
for
,
after
all
,
Mr.
Rochester
and
 
because
closely
connected
with
him
 
<EOS>
Miss
Ingram
were
the
life
and
soul
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
If
he
was
absent
from
the
room
an
hour
,
a
perceptible
dulness
seemed
to
steal
over
the
spirits
of
his
guests
;
and
his
re
-
entrance
was
sure
to
give
a
fresh
impulse
to
the
vivacity
of
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
The
want
of
his
animating
influence
appeared
to
be
peculiarly
felt
one
day
that
he
had
been
summoned
to
Millcote
on
business
,
and
was
not
likely
to
return
till
late
.
<EOS>
The
afternoon
was
wet
:
a
walk
the
party
had
proposed
to
take
to
see
a
gipsy
camp
,
lately
pitched
on
a
common
beyond
Hay
,
was
consequently
deferred
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
gentlemen
were
gone
to
the
stables
:
<EOS>
the
younger
ones
,
together
with
the
younger
ladies
,
were
playing
billiards
in
the
billiard
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
dowagers
Ingram
and
Lynn
sought
solace
in
a
quiet
game
at
cards
.
<EOS>
Blanche
Ingram
,
after
having
repelled
,
by
supercilious
taciturnity
,
some
efforts
of
Mrs.
Dent
and
Mrs.
Eshton
to
draw
her
into
conversation
,
had
first
murmured
over
some
sentimental
tunes
and
airs
on
the
piano
,
and
then
,
having
fetched
a
novel
from
the
library
,
had
flung
herself
in
haughty
listlessness
on
a
sofa
,
and
prepared
to
beguile
,
by
the
spell
of
fiction
,
the
tedious
hours
of
absence
.
<EOS>
The
room
and
the
house
were
silent
:
only
now
and
then
the
merriment
of
the
billiard
-
players
was
heard
from
above
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
verging
on
dusk
,
and
the
clock
had
already
given
warning
of
the
hour
to
dress
for
dinner
,
when
little
Adele
,
who
knelt
by
me
in
the
drawing
-
room
window
-
seat
,
suddenly
exclaimed
    
"
Voila
,
Monsieur
Rochester
,
qui
revient
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
turned
,
and
Miss
Ingram
darted
forwards
from
her
sofa
:
<EOS>
the
others
,
too
,
looked
up
from
their
several
occupations
;
for
at
the
same
time
a
crunching
of
wheels
and
a
splashing
tramp
of
horse
-
hoofs
became
audible
on
the
wet
gravel
.
<EOS>
A
post
-
chaise
was
approaching
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
possess
him
to
come
home
in
that
style
?
"
said
Miss
Ingram
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
rode
Mesrour
(
the
black
horse
)
,
did
he
not
,
when
he
went
out
?
<EOS>
and
Pilot
was
with
him
:
 
<EOS>
what
has
he
done
with
the
animals
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
said
this
,
she
approached
her
tall
person
and
ample
garments
so
near
the
window
,
that
I
was
obliged
to
bend
back
almost
to
the
breaking
of
my
spine
:
in
her
eagerness
she
did
not
observe
me
at
first
,
but
when
she
did
,
she
curled
her
lip
and
moved
to
another
casement
.
<EOS>
The
post
-
chaise
stopped
;
the
driver
rang
the
door
-
bell
,
and
a
gentleman
alighted
attired
in
travelling
garb
;
but
it
was
not
Mr.
Rochester
;
it
was
a
tall
,
fashionable
-
looking
man
,
a
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
provoking
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Miss
Ingram
:
"
you
tiresome
monkey
!
"
<EOS>
(
apostrophising
Adele
)
,
"
who
perched
you
up
in
the
window
to
give
false
intelligence
?
"
<EOS>
and
she
cast
on
me
an
angry
glance
,
as
if
I
were
in
fault
.
  
<EOS>
Some
parleying
was
audible
in
the
hall
,
and
soon
the
new
-
comer
entered
.
<EOS>
He
bowed
to
Lady
Ingram
,
as
deeming
her
the
eldest
lady
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
appears
I
come
at
an
inopportune
time
,
madam
,
"
said
he
,
"
when
my
friend
,
Mr.
Rochester
,
is
from
home
;
but
I
arrive
from
a
very
long
journey
,
and
I
think
I
may
presume
so
far
on
old
and
intimate
acquaintance
as
to
instal
myself
here
till
he
returns
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
manner
was
polite
;
his
accent
,
in
speaking
,
struck
me
as
being
somewhat
unusual
,
 
not
precisely
foreign
,
but
still
not
altogether
English
:
his
age
might
be
about
Mr.
Rochester
's
,
 
between
thirty
and
forty
;
his
complexion
was
singularly
sallow
:
otherwise
he
was
a
fine
-
looking
man
,
at
first
sight
especially
.
<EOS>
On
closer
examination
,
you
detected
something
in
his
face
that
displeased
,
or
rather
that
failed
to
please
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
regular
,
but
too
relaxed
:
his
eye
was
large
and
well
cut
,
but
the
life
looking
out
of
it
was
a
tame
,
vacant
life
 
<EOS>
at
least
so
I
thought
.
  
<EOS>
The
sound
of
the
dressing
-
bell
dispersed
the
party
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
after
dinner
that
I
saw
him
again
:
he
then
seemed
quite
at
his
ease
.
<EOS>
But
I
liked
his
physiognomy
even
less
than
before
:
it
struck
me
as
being
at
the
same
time
unsettled
and
inanimate
.
<EOS>
His
eye
wandered
,
and
had
no
meaning
in
its
wandering
:
this
gave
him
an
odd
look
,
such
as
I
never
remembered
to
have
seen
.
<EOS>
For
a
handsome
and
not
an
unamiable
-
looking
man
,
he
repelled
me
exceedingly
:
there
was
no
power
in
that
smooth
-
skinned
face
of
a
full
oval
shape
:
no
firmness
in
that
aquiline
nose
and
small
cherry
mouth
;
there
was
no
thought
on
the
low
,
even
forehead
;
no
command
in
that
blank
,
brown
eye
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
sat
in
my
usual
nook
,
and
looked
at
him
with
the
light
of
the
girandoles
on
the
mantelpiece
beaming
full
over
him
 
for
he
occupied
an
arm
-
chair
drawn
close
to
the
fire
,
and
kept
shrinking
still
nearer
,
as
if
he
were
cold
,
I
compared
him
with
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
I
think
(
with
deference
be
it
spoken
)
<EOS>
the
contrast
could
not
be
much
greater
between
a
sleek
gander
and
a
fierce
falcon
:
between
a
meek
sheep
and
the
rough
-
coated
keen
-
eyed
dog
,
its
guardian
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
of
Mr.
Rochester
as
an
old
friend
.
<EOS>
A
curious
friendship
theirs
must
have
been
:
a
pointed
illustration
,
indeed
,
of
the
old
adage
that
"
extremes
meet
.
"
  
<EOS>
Two
or
three
of
the
gentlemen
sat
near
him
,
and
I
caught
at
times
scraps
of
their
conversation
across
the
room
.
<EOS>
At
first
I
could
not
make
much
sense
of
what
I
heard
;
for
the
discourse
of
Louisa
Eshton
and
Mary
Ingram
,
who
sat
nearer
to
me
,
confused
the
fragmentary
sentences
that
reached
me
at
intervals
.
<EOS>
These
last
were
discussing
the
stranger
;
they
both
called
him
"
a
beautiful
man
.
"
<EOS>
Louisa
said
he
was
"
a
love
of
a
creature
,
"
and
she
"
adored
him
;
"
and
Mary
instanced
his
"
pretty
little
mouth
,
and
nice
nose
,
"
as
her
ideal
of
the
charming
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
a
sweet
-
tempered
forehead
he
has
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Louisa
,
 
"
so
smooth
 
none
of
those
frowning
irregularities
I
dislike
so
much
;
and
such
a
placid
eye
and
smile
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
then
,
to
my
great
relief
,
Mr.
Henry
Lynn
summoned
them
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
,
to
settle
some
point
about
the
deferred
excursion
to
Hay
Common
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
now
able
to
concentrate
my
attention
on
the
group
by
the
fire
,
and
I
presently
gathered
that
the
new
-
comer
was
called
Mr.
Mason
<EOS>
;
then
I
learned
that
he
was
but
just
arrived
in
England
,
and
that
he
came
from
some
hot
country
:
which
was
the
reason
,
doubtless
,
<EOS>
his
face
was
so
sallow
,
and
that
he
sat
so
near
the
hearth
,
and
wore
a
surtout
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Presently
the
words
Jamaica
,
Kingston
,
Spanish
Town
,
indicated
the
West
Indies
as
his
residence
;
and
it
was
with
no
little
surprise
I
gathered
,
ere
long
,
that
he
had
there
first
seen
and
become
acquainted
with
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
of
his
friend
's
dislike
of
the
burning
heats
,
the
hurricanes
,
and
rainy
seasons
of
that
region
.
<EOS>
I
knew
Mr.
Rochester
had
been
a
traveller
:
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
had
said
so
;
but
I
thought
the
continent
of
Europe
had
bounded
his
wanderings
;
till
now
I
had
never
heard
a
hint
given
of
visits
to
more
distant
shores
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
pondering
these
things
,
when
an
incident
,
and
a
somewhat
unexpected
one
,
broke
the
thread
of
my
musings
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mason
,
shivering
as
some
one
chanced
to
open
the
door
,
asked
for
more
coal
to
be
put
on
the
fire
,
which
had
burnt
out
its
flame
,
though
its
mass
of
cinder
still
shone
hot
and
red
.
<EOS>
The
footman
who
brought
the
coal
,
in
going
out
,
stopped
near
Mr.
Eshton
's
chair
,
and
said
something
to
him
in
a
low
voice
,
of
which
I
heard
only
the
words
,
"
old
woman
,
"
 
"
quite
troublesome
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
her
she
shall
be
put
in
the
stocks
if
she
does
not
take
herself
off
,
"
replied
the
magistrate
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
stop
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Colonel
Dent
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
send
her
away
,
Eshton
;
we
might
turn
the
thing
to
account
;
better
consult
the
ladies
.
"
<EOS>
And
speaking
aloud
,
he
continued
 
<EOS>
"
Ladies
,
you
talked
of
going
to
Hay
Common
to
visit
the
gipsy
camp
;
Sam
here
says
that
one
of
the
old
Mother
Bunches
is
in
the
servants
'
hall
at
this
moment
,
and
insists
upon
being
brought
in
before
"
the
quality
,
"
to
tell
them
their
fortunes
.
<EOS>
Would
you
like
to
see
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
colonel
,
"
cried
Lady
Ingram
,
"
you
would
not
encourage
such
a
low
impostor
?
<EOS>
Dismiss
her
,
by
all
means
,
at
once
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
can
not
persuade
her
to
go
away
,
my
lady
,
"
said
the
footman
;
"
nor
can
any
of
the
servants
:
Mrs.
Fairfax
is
with
her
just
now
,
entreating
her
to
be
gone
;
but
she
has
taken
a
chair
in
the
chimney
-
corner
,
and
says
nothing
shall
stir
her
from
it
till
she
gets
leave
to
come
in
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
she
want
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Eshton
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
To
tell
the
gentry
their
fortunes
,
"
she
says
,
ma'am
;
and
she
swears
she
must
and
will
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
she
like
?
"
inquired
the
Misses
Eshton
,
in
a
breath
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
shockingly
ugly
old
creature
,
miss
;
almost
as
black
as
a
crock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
she
's
a
real
sorceress
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Frederick
Lynn
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
have
her
in
,
of
course
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
rejoined
his
brother
;
"
it
would
be
a
thousand
pities
to
throw
away
such
a
chance
of
fun
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
boys
,
what
are
you
thinking
about
?
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Lynn
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
possibly
countenance
any
such
inconsistent
proceeding
,
"
chimed
in
the
Dowager
Ingram
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
mama
,
but
you
can
 
and
will
,
"
pronounced
the
haughty
voice
of
Blanche
,
as
she
turned
round
on
the
piano
-
stool
;
where
till
now
she
had
sat
silent
,
apparently
examining
sundry
sheets
of
music
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
curiosity
to
hear
my
fortune
told
:
therefore
,
Sam
,
order
the
beldame
forward
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
My
darling
Blanche
!
<EOS>
recollect
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
do
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
all
you
can
suggest
;
and
I
must
have
my
will
 
quick
,
Sam
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
yes
 
yes
!
"
cried
all
the
juveniles
,
both
ladies
and
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
"
Let
her
come
 
it
will
be
excellent
sport
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
footman
still
lingered
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
looks
such
a
rough
one
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Miss
Ingram
,
and
the
man
went
.
  
<EOS>
Excitement
instantly
seized
the
whole
party
:
a
running
fire
of
raillery
and
jests
was
proceeding
when
Sam
returned
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
wo
n't
come
now
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
says
it
's
not
her
mission
to
appear
before
the
"
vulgar
herd
"
<EOS>
(
them
's
her
words
)
.
<EOS>
I
must
show
her
into
a
room
by
herself
,
and
then
those
who
wish
to
consult
her
must
go
to
her
one
by
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
now
,
my
queenly
Blanche
,
"
began
Lady
Ingram
,
"
she
encroaches
.
<EOS>
Be
advised
,
my
angel
girl
 
and
 
"
  
"
Show
her
into
the
library
,
of
course
,
"
cut
in
the
"
angel
girl
.
"
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
my
mission
to
listen
to
her
before
the
vulgar
herd
either
:
I
mean
to
have
her
all
to
myself
.
<EOS>
Is
there
a
fire
in
the
library
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
 
<EOS>
but
she
looks
such
a
tinkler
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Cease
that
chatter
,
blockhead
!
<EOS>
and
do
my
bidding
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Again
Sam
vanished
;
and
mystery
,
animation
,
expectation
rose
to
full
flow
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
ready
now
,
"
said
the
footman
,
as
he
reappeared
.
<EOS>
"
She
wishes
to
know
who
will
be
her
first
visitor
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
had
better
just
look
in
upon
her
before
any
of
the
ladies
go
,
"
said
Colonel
Dent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
her
,
Sam
,
a
gentleman
is
coming
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sam
went
and
returned
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
says
,
sir
,
that
she
'll
have
no
gentlemen
<EOS>
;
they
need
not
trouble
themselves
to
come
near
her
;
nor
,
"
he
added
,
with
difficulty
suppressing
a
titter
,
"
any
ladies
either
,
except
the
young
,
and
single
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
Jove
,
she
has
taste
!
"
exclaimed
Henry
Lynn
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Ingram
rose
solemnly
:
"
I
go
first
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
tone
which
might
have
befitted
the
leader
of
a
forlorn
hope
,
mounting
a
breach
in
the
van
of
his
men
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
best
!
<EOS>
oh
,
my
dearest
!
<EOS>
pause
 
<EOS>
reflect
!
"
<EOS>
was
her
mama
's
cry
;
but
she
swept
past
her
in
stately
silence
,
passed
through
the
door
which
Colonel
Dent
held
open
,
and
we
heard
her
enter
the
library
.
  
<EOS>
A
comparative
silence
ensued
.
<EOS>
Lady
Ingram
thought
it
"
le
cas
"
to
wring
her
hands
:
which
she
did
accordingly
.
<EOS>
Miss
Mary
declared
she
felt
,
for
her
part
,
she
never
dared
venture
.
<EOS>
Amy
and
Louisa
Eshton
tittered
under
their
breath
,
and
looked
a
little
frightened
.
  
<EOS>
The
minutes
passed
very
slowly
:
fifteen
were
counted
before
the
library-
door
again
opened
.
<EOS>
Miss
Ingram
returned
to
us
through
the
arch
.
  
<EOS>
Would
she
laugh
?
<EOS>
Would
she
take
it
as
a
joke
?
<EOS>
All
eyes
met
her
with
a
glance
of
eager
curiosity
,
and
she
met
all
eyes
with
one
of
rebuff
and
coldness
<EOS>
;
she
looked
neither
flurried
nor
merry
:
she
walked
stiffly
to
her
seat
,
and
took
it
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Blanche
?
"
said
Lord
Ingram
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
she
say
,
sister
?
"
asked
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
think
?
<EOS>
How
do
you
feel
?
 
<EOS>
Is
she
a
real
fortune
-
teller
?
"
demanded
the
Misses
Eshton
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
now
,
good
people
,
"
returned
Miss
Ingram
,
"
do
n't
press
upon
me
.
<EOS>
Really
your
organs
of
wonder
and
credulity
are
easily
excited
<EOS>
:
you
seem
,
by
the
importance
of
you
all
 
my
good
mama
included
 
ascribe
to
this
matter
,
absolutely
to
believe
we
have
a
genuine
witch
in
the
house
,
who
is
in
close
alliance
with
the
old
gentleman
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
a
gipsy
vagabond
;
she
has
practised
in
hackneyed
fashion
the
science
of
palmistry
and
told
me
what
such
people
usually
tell
.
<EOS>
My
whim
is
gratified
;
and
now
I
think
Mr.
Eshton
will
do
well
to
put
the
hag
in
the
stocks
to
-
morrow
morning
,
as
he
threatened
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Ingram
took
a
book
,
leant
back
in
her
chair
,
and
so
declined
further
conversation
.
<EOS>
I
watched
her
for
nearly
half
-
an
-
hour
:
during
all
that
time
she
never
turned
a
page
,
and
her
face
grew
momently
darker
,
more
dissatisfied
,
and
more
sourly
expressive
of
disappointment
.
<EOS>
She
had
obviously
not
heard
anything
to
her
advantage
:
and
it
seemed
to
me
,
from
her
prolonged
fit
of
gloom
and
taciturnity
,
that
she
herself
,
notwithstanding
her
professed
indifference
,
attached
undue
importance
to
whatever
revelations
had
been
made
her
.
  
<EOS>
{
During
all
that
time
she
never
turned
a
page
:
p184.jpg
}
  
<EOS>
Meantime
,
Mary
Ingram
,
Amy
and
Louisa
Eshton
,
declared
they
dared
not
go
alone
;
and
yet
they
all
wished
to
go
.
<EOS>
A
negotiation
was
opened
through
the
medium
of
the
ambassador
,
Sam
;
and
after
much
pacing
to
and
fro
,
till
,
I
think
,
the
said
Sam
's
calves
must
have
ached
with
the
exercise
<EOS>
,
permission
was
at
last
,
with
great
difficulty
,
extorted
from
the
rigorous
Sibyl
,
for
the
three
to
wait
upon
her
in
a
body
.
  
<EOS>
Their
visit
was
not
so
still
as
Miss
Ingram
's
had
been
:
we
heard
hysterical
giggling
and
little
shrieks
proceeding
from
the
library
;
and
at
the
end
of
about
twenty
minutes
they
burst
the
door
open
,
and
came
running
across
the
hall
,
as
if
they
were
half
-
scared
out
of
their
wits
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
she
is
something
not
right
!
"
<EOS>
they
cried
,
one
and
all
.
"
<EOS>
She
told
us
such
things
!
<EOS>
She
knows
all
about
us
!
"
<EOS>
and
they
sank
breathless
into
the
various
seats
the
gentlemen
hastened
to
bring
them
.
  
<EOS>
Pressed
for
further
explanation
,
they
declared
she
had
told
them
of
things
they
had
said
and
done
when
they
were
mere
children
;
described
books
and
ornaments
they
had
in
their
boudoirs
at
home
:
keepsakes
that
different
relations
had
presented
to
them
.
<EOS>
They
affirmed
that
she
had
even
divined
their
thoughts
,
and
had
whispered
in
the
ear
of
each
the
name
of
the
person
she
liked
best
in
the
world
,
and
informed
them
of
what
they
most
wished
for
.
  
<EOS>
Here
the
gentlemen
interposed
with
earnest
petitions
to
be
further
enlightened
on
these
two
last
-
named
points
;
but
they
got
only
blushes
,
ejaculations
,
tremors
,
and
titters
,
in
return
for
their
importunity
.
<EOS>
The
matrons
,
meantime
,
offered
vinaigrettes
and
wielded
fans
;
and
again
and
again
reiterated
the
expression
of
their
concern
that
their
warning
had
not
been
taken
in
time
;
and
the
elder
gentlemen
laughed
,
and
the
younger
urged
their
services
on
the
agitated
fair
ones
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
tumult
,
and
while
my
eyes
and
ears
were
fully
engaged
in
the
scene
before
me
,
I
heard
a
hem
close
at
my
elbow
:
I
turned
,
and
saw
Sam
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
miss
,
the
gipsy
declares
that
there
is
another
young
single
lady
in
the
room
who
has
not
been
to
her
yet
,
and
she
swears
she
will
not
go
till
she
has
seen
all
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
must
be
you
:
there
is
no
one
else
for
it
.
<EOS>
What
shall
I
tell
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
will
go
by
all
means
,
"
I
answered
:
and
<EOS>
I
was
glad
of
the
unexpected
opportunity
to
gratify
my
much
-
excited
curiosity
.
<EOS>
I
slipped
out
of
the
room
,
unobserved
by
any
eye
 
for
the
company
were
gathered
in
one
mass
about
the
trembling
trio
<EOS>
just
returned
 
<EOS>
and
I
closed
the
door
quietly
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
like
,
miss
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
I
'll
wait
in
the
hall
for
you
;
and
if
she
frightens
you
,
just
call
<EOS>
and
I
'll
come
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sam
,
return
to
the
kitchen
:
<EOS>
I
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
Nor
was
I
;
but
I
was
a
good
deal
interested
and
excited
.
    
<EOS>
The
library
looked
tranquil
enough
as
I
entered
it
,
and
the
Sibyl
 
if
Sibyl
<EOS>
she
were
 
<EOS>
was
seated
snugly
enough
in
an
easy
-
chair
at
the
chimney-
corner
.
<EOS>
She
had
on
a
red
cloak
and
a
black
bonnet
:
or
rather
,
a
broad-
brimmed
gipsy
hat
,
tied
down
with
a
striped
handkerchief
under
her
chin
.
<EOS>
An
extinguished
candle
stood
on
the
table
;
she
was
bending
over
the
fire
,
and
seemed
reading
in
a
little
black
book
,
like
a
prayer
-
book
,
by
the
light
of
the
blaze
:
she
muttered
the
words
to
herself
,
as
most
old
women
do
,
while
she
read
;
she
did
not
desist
immediately
on
my
entrance
:
<EOS>
it
appeared
she
wished
to
finish
a
paragraph
.
  
<EOS>
I
stood
on
the
rug
and
warmed
my
hands
,
which
were
rather
cold
with
sitting
at
a
distance
from
the
drawing
-
room
fire
.
<EOS>
I
felt
now
as
composed
as
ever
<EOS>
I
did
in
my
life
:
there
was
nothing
indeed
in
the
gipsy
's
appearance
to
trouble
one
's
calm
.
<EOS>
She
shut
her
book
and
slowly
looked
up
;
her
hat
-
brim
partially
shaded
her
face
,
yet
I
could
see
,
as
she
raised
it
,
that
it
was
a
strange
one
.
<EOS>
It
looked
all
brown
and
black
:
<EOS>
elf-
locks
bristled
out
from
beneath
a
white
band
which
passed
under
her
chin
,
and
came
half
over
her
cheeks
,
or
rather
jaws
:
her
eye
confronted
me
at
once
,
with
a
bold
and
direct
gaze
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
you
want
your
fortune
told
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
in
a
voice
as
decided
as
her
glance
,
as
harsh
as
her
features
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
about
it
,
mother
;
you
may
please
yourself
:
<EOS>
but
I
ought
to
warn
you
,
I
have
no
faith
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
like
your
impudence
to
say
so
:
<EOS>
I
expected
it
of
you
;
I
heard
it
in
your
step
as
you
crossed
the
threshold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
?
<EOS>
You
've
a
quick
ear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
;
and
a
quick
eye
and
a
quick
brain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
them
all
in
your
trade
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
;
especially
when
I
've
customers
like
you
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
tremble
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
cold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
turn
pale
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
sick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
consult
my
art
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
silly
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
crone
"
nichered
"
a
laugh
under
her
bonnet
and
bandage
;
she
then
drew
out
a
short
black
pipe
,
and
lighting
<EOS>
it
began
to
smoke
.
<EOS>
Having
indulged
a
while
in
this
sedative
,
she
raised
her
bent
body
,
took
the
pipe
from
her
lips
,
and
while
gazing
steadily
at
the
fire
,
said
very
deliberately
 
"
You
are
cold
;
you
are
sick
;
and
you
are
silly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Prove
it
,
"
I
rejoined
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
in
few
words
.
<EOS>
You
are
cold
,
because
you
are
alone
:
no
contact
strikes
the
fire
from
you
that
is
in
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
sick
;
because
the
best
of
feelings
,
the
highest
and
the
sweetest
given
to
man
,
keeps
far
away
from
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
silly
,
because
,
suffer
as
you
may
,
you
will
not
beckon
it
to
approach
,
nor
will
you
stir
one
step
to
meet
it
where
it
waits
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
again
put
her
short
black
pipe
to
her
lips
,
and
renewed
her
smoking
with
vigour
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
say
all
that
to
almost
any
one
who
you
knew
lived
as
a
solitary
dependent
in
a
great
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
might
say
it
to
almost
any
one
:
but
would
it
be
true
of
almost
any
one
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
my
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
just
so
,
in
_
your
_
circumstances
:
but
find
me
another
precisely
placed
as
you
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
easy
to
find
you
thousands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
could
scarcely
find
me
one
.
<EOS>
If
you
knew
it
,
you
are
peculiarly
situated
:
very
near
happiness
;
yes
,
within
reach
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
materials
are
all
prepared
;
there
only
wants
a
movement
to
combine
them
.
<EOS>
Chance
laid
them
somewhat
apart
;
let
them
be
once
approached
and
bliss
results
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
enigmas
.
<EOS>
I
never
could
guess
a
riddle
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
wish
me
to
speak
more
plainly
,
show
me
your
palm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
must
cross
it
with
silver
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
gave
her
a
shilling
:
she
put
it
into
an
old
stocking
-
foot
which
she
took
out
of
her
pocket
,
and
having
tied
it
round
and
returned
it
,
she
told
me
to
hold
out
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
did
.
<EOS>
She
approached
her
face
to
the
palm
,
and
pored
over
it
without
touching
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
fine
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
make
nothing
of
such
a
hand
as
that
;
almost
without
lines
:
besides
,
what
is
in
a
palm
?
<EOS>
Destiny
is
not
written
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
,
"
said
I.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
continued
,
"
it
is
in
the
face
:
on
the
forehead
,
about
the
eyes
,
in
the
lines
of
the
mouth
.
<EOS>
Kneel
,
and
lift
up
your
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
now
you
are
coming
to
reality
,
"
I
said
,
as
I
obeyed
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
begin
to
put
some
faith
in
you
presently
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
knelt
within
half
a
yard
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
stirred
the
fire
,
so
that
a
ripple
of
light
broke
from
the
disturbed
coal
:
<EOS>
the
glare
,
however
,
as
she
sat
,
only
threw
her
face
into
deeper
shadow
:
mine
,
it
illumined
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
with
what
feelings
you
came
to
me
to
-
night
,
"
she
said
,
when
she
had
examined
me
a
while
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
thoughts
are
busy
in
your
heart
during
all
the
hours
you
sit
in
yonder
room
with
the
fine
people
flitting
before
you
like
shapes
in
a
magic
-
lantern
:
just
as
little
sympathetic
communion
passing
between
you
and
them
as
if
they
were
really
mere
shadows
of
human
forms
,
and
not
the
actual
substance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
tired
often
,
sleepy
sometimes
,
but
seldom
sad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
have
some
secret
hope
to
buoy
you
up
and
please
you
with
whispers
of
the
future
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
I.
<EOS>
The
utmost
I
hope
is
,
to
save
money
enough
out
of
my
earnings
to
set
up
a
school
some
day
in
a
little
house
rented
by
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
mean
nutriment
for
the
spirit
to
exist
on
:
and
sitting
in
that
window-
seat
<EOS>
(
you
see
<EOS>
I
know
your
habits
)
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
have
learned
them
from
the
servants
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
think
yourself
sharp
.
<EOS>
Well
,
perhaps
I
have
:
to
speak
truth
,
I
have
an
acquaintance
with
one
of
them
,
Mrs.
Poole
 
<EOS>
"
  
I
started
to
my
feet
when
I
heard
the
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
 
have
you
?
"
<EOS>
thought
I
;
"
there
is
diablerie
in
the
business
after
all
,
then
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
be
alarmed
,
"
continued
the
strange
being
;
"
she
's
a
safe
hand
is
Mrs.
Poole
:
close
and
quiet
;
any
one
may
repose
confidence
in
her
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
was
saying
:
sitting
in
that
window
-
seat
,
do
you
think
of
nothing
but
your
future
school
?
<EOS>
Have
you
no
present
interest
in
any
of
the
company
who
occupy
the
sofas
and
chairs
before
you
?
<EOS>
Is
there
not
one
face
you
study
?
<EOS>
one
figure
whose
movements
you
follow
with
at
least
curiosity
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
to
observe
all
the
faces
and
all
the
figures
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
do
you
never
single
one
from
the
rest
 
or
it
may
be
,
two
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
frequently
;
when
the
gestures
or
looks
of
a
pair
seem
telling
a
tale
:
it
amuses
me
to
watch
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
tale
do
you
like
best
to
hear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
have
not
much
choice
!
<EOS>
They
generally
run
on
the
same
theme
 
courtship
;
and
promise
to
end
in
the
same
catastrophe
 
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
like
that
monotonous
theme
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Positively
,
I
do
n't
care
about
it
:
it
is
nothing
to
me
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nothing
to
you
?
<EOS>
When
a
lady
,
young
and
full
of
life
and
health
,
charming
with
beauty
and
endowed
with
the
gifts
of
rank
and
fortune
,
sits
and
smiles
in
the
eyes
of
a
gentleman
<EOS>
you
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
what
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
 
and
perhaps
think
well
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
the
gentlemen
here
.
<EOS>
I
have
scarcely
interchanged
a
syllable
with
one
of
them
;
and
as
to
thinking
well
of
them
,
I
consider
some
respectable
,
and
stately
,
and
middle
-
aged
,
and
others
young
,
dashing
,
handsome
,
and
lively
:
but
certainly
they
are
all
at
liberty
to
be
the
recipients
of
whose
smiles
they
please
,
without
my
feeling
disposed
to
consider
the
transaction
of
any
moment
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
the
gentlemen
here
?
<EOS>
You
have
not
exchanged
a
syllable
with
one
of
them
?
<EOS>
Will
you
say
that
of
the
master
of
the
house
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
profound
remark
!
<EOS>
A
most
ingenious
quibble
!
<EOS>
He
went
to
Millcote
this
morning
,
and
will
be
back
here
to
-
night
or
to
-
morrow
:
<EOS>
does
that
circumstance
exclude
him
from
the
list
of
your
acquaintance
 
<EOS>
blot
him
,
as
it
were
,
out
of
existence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
<EOS>
but
I
can
scarcely
see
what
Mr.
Rochester
has
to
do
with
the
theme
you
had
introduced
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
talking
of
ladies
smiling
in
the
eyes
of
gentlemen
;
and
of
late
so
many
smiles
have
been
shed
into
Mr.
Rochester
's
eyes
that
they
overflow
like
two
cups
filled
above
the
brim
<EOS>
:
have
you
never
remarked
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rochester
has
a
right
to
enjoy
the
society
of
his
guests
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
question
about
his
right
:
but
have
you
never
observed
that
,
of
all
the
tales
told
here
about
matrimony
,
Mr.
Rochester
has
been
favoured
with
the
most
lively
and
the
most
continuous
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
eagerness
of
a
listener
quickens
the
tongue
of
a
narrator
.
<EOS>
"
I
said
this
rather
to
myself
than
to
the
gipsy
,
whose
strange
talk
,
voice
,
manner
,
had
by
this
time
wrapped
me
in
a
kind
of
dream
.
<EOS>
One
unexpected
sentence
came
from
her
lips
after
another
,
till
I
got
involved
in
a
web
of
mystification
;
and
wondered
what
unseen
spirit
had
been
sitting
for
weeks
by
my
heart
watching
its
workings
and
taking
record
of
every
pulse
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eagerness
of
a
listener
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
she
:
"
<EOS>
yes
;
Mr.
Rochester
has
sat
by
the
hour
,
his
ear
inclined
to
the
fascinating
lips
that
took
such
delight
in
their
task
of
communicating
;
and
Mr.
Rochester
was
so
willing
to
receive
and
looked
so
grateful
for
the
pastime
given
him
;
you
have
noticed
this
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Grateful
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
remember
detecting
gratitude
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Detecting
!
<EOS>
You
have
analysed
,
then
.
<EOS>
And
what
did
you
detect
,
if
not
gratitude
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
love
:
have
you
not
?
 
<EOS>
and
,
looking
forward
,
you
have
seen
him
married
,
and
beheld
his
bride
happy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
<EOS>
Not
exactly
.
<EOS>
Your
witch
's
skill
is
rather
at
fault
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
have
you
seen
,
then
?
"
  
"
Never
mind
:
<EOS>
I
came
here
to
inquire
,
not
to
confess
.
<EOS>
Is
it
known
that
Mr.
Rochester
is
to
be
married
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
and
to
the
beautiful
Miss

Shortly
?
"
  
"
Appearances
would
warrant
that
conclusion
:
and
,
no
doubt
(
though
,
with
an
audacity
that
wants
chastising
out
of
you
,
you
seem
to
question
it
)
,
they
will
be
a
superlatively
happy
pair
.
<EOS>
He
must
love
such
a
handsome
,
noble
,
witty
,
accomplished
lady
;
and
probably
she
loves
him
,
or
,
if
not
his
person
,
at
least
his
purse
.
<EOS>
I
know
she
considers
the
Rochester
estate
eligible
to
the
last
degree
;
though
(
God
pardon
me
!
)
<EOS>
I
told
her
something
on
that
point
about
an
hour
ago
which
made
her
look
<EOS>
wondrous
grave
<EOS>
:
the
corners
of
her
mouth
fell
half
an
inch
.
<EOS>
I
would
advise
her
blackaviced
suitor
to
look
out
:
if
another
comes
,
with
a
longer
or
clearer
rent
-
roll
,
 
he
's
dished
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
,
mother
,
I
did
not
come
to
hear
Mr.
Rochester
's
fortune
:
I
came
to
hear
my
own
;
and
you
have
told
me
nothing
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
fortune
is
yet
doubtful
:
when
I
examined
your
face
,
one
trait
contradicted
another
.
<EOS>
Chance
has
meted
you
a
measure
of
happiness
:
that
I
know
.
<EOS>
I
knew
it
before
I
came
here
this
evening
.
<EOS>
She
has
laid
it
carefully
on
one
side
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
do
it
.
<EOS>
It
depends
on
yourself
to
stretch
out
your
hand
,
and
take
it
up
:
but
whether
you
will
do
so
,
is
the
problem
I
study
.
<EOS>
Kneel
again
on
the
rug
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
keep
me
long
;
the
fire
scorches
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
{
She
did
not
stoop
towards
me
,
but
only
gazed
,
leaning
back
in
her
chair
:

}
  
<EOS>
I
knelt
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
stoop
towards
me
,
but
only
gazed
,
leaning
back
in
her
chair
.
<EOS>
She
began
muttering
,
    
"
The
flame
flickers
in
the
eye
;
the
eye
shines
like
dew
;
it
looks
soft
and
full
of
feeling
;
it
smiles
at
my
jargon
:
<EOS>
it
is
susceptible
;
impression
follows
impression
through
its
clear
sphere
;
where
it
ceases
to
smile
,
it
is
sad
;
an
unconscious
lassitude
weighs
on
the
lid
:
that
signifies
melancholy
resulting
from
loneliness
.
<EOS>
It
turns
from
me
;
it
will
not
suffer
further
scrutiny
;
it
seems
to
deny
,
by
a
mocking
glance
,
the
truth
of
the
discoveries
I
have
already
made
,
 
to
disown
the
charge
both
of
sensibility
and
chagrin
:
its
pride
and
reserve
only
confirm
me
in
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
The
eye
is
favourable
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
the
mouth
,
it
delights
at
times
in
laughter
;
it
is
disposed
to
impart
all
that
the
brain
conceives
;
though
I
daresay
it
would
be
silent
on
much
the
heart
experiences
.
<EOS>
Mobile
and
flexible
,
it
was
never
intended
to
be
compressed
in
the
eternal
silence
of
solitude
:
it
is
a
mouth
which
should
speak
much
and
smile
often
,
and
have
human
affection
for
its
interlocutor
.
<EOS>
That
feature
too
is
propitious
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
no
enemy
to
a
fortunate
issue
but
in
the
brow
;
and
that
brow
professes
to
say
,
 
"
I
can
live
alone
,
if
self
-
respect
,
and
circumstances
require
me
so
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
sell
my
soul
to
buy
bliss
.
<EOS>
I
have
an
inward
treasure
born
with
me
,
which
can
keep
me
alive
if
all
extraneous
delights
should
be
withheld
,
or
offered
only
at
a
price
I
can
not
afford
to
give
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
forehead
declares
,
"
Reason
sits
firm
and
holds
the
reins
,
and
she
will
not
let
the
feelings
burst
away
and
hurry
her
to
wild
chasms
.
<EOS>
The
passions
may
rage
furiously
,
like
true
heathens
,
as
they
are
;
and
the
desires
may
imagine
all
sorts
of
vain
things
:
but
judgment
shall
still
have
the
last
word
in
every
argument
,
and
the
casting
vote
in
every
decision
.
<EOS>
Strong
wind
,
earthquake
-
shock
,
and
fire
may
pass
by
:
but
I
shall
follow
the
guiding
of
that
still
small
voice
which
interprets
the
dictates
of
conscience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
said
,
forehead
;
your
declaration
shall
be
respected
.
<EOS>
I
have
formed
my
plans
 
<EOS>
right
plans
<EOS>
I
deem
them
 
and
in
them
I
have
attended
to
the
claims
of
conscience
,
the
counsels
of
reason
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
soon
youth
would
fade
and
bloom
perish
,
if
,
in
the
cup
of
bliss
offered
,
but
one
dreg
of
shame
,
or
one
flavour
of
remorse
were
detected
;
and
I
do
not
want
sacrifice
,
sorrow
,
dissolution
 
<EOS>
such
is
not
my
taste
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
foster
,
not
to
blight
 
to
earn
gratitude
,
not
to
wring
tears
of
blood
 
no
,
nor
of
brine
:
my
harvest
must
be
in
smiles
,
in
endearments
,
in
sweet
 
That
will
do
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
rave
in
a
kind
of
exquisite
delirium
.
<EOS>
I
should
wish
now
to
protract
this
moment
_
ad
infinitum
_
;
but
I
dare
not
.
<EOS>
So
far
I
have
governed
myself
thoroughly
.
<EOS>
I
have
acted
as
I
inwardly
swore
I
would
act
;
but
further
might
try
me
beyond
my
strength
.
<EOS>
Rise
,
Miss
Eyre
:
leave
me
;
the
play
is
played
out
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Where
was
I
?
<EOS>
Did
I
wake
or
sleep
?
<EOS>
Had
I
been
dreaming
?
<EOS>
Did
I
dream
still
?
<EOS>
The
old
woman
's
voice
had
changed
:
her
accent
,
her
gesture
,
and
all
were
familiar
to
me
as
my
own
face
in
a
glass
 
as
the
speech
of
my
own
tongue
.
<EOS>
I
got
up
,
but
did
not
go
.
<EOS>
I
looked
;
I
stirred
the
fire
,
and
I
looked
again
:
but
she
drew
her
bonnet
and
her
bandage
closer
about
her
face
,
and
again
beckoned
me
to
depart
.
<EOS>
The
flame
illuminated
her
hand
stretched
out
:
roused
now
,
and
on
the
alert
for
discoveries
,
I
at
once
noticed
that
hand
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
more
the
withered
limb
of
eld
than
my
own
;
it
was
a
rounded
supple
member
,
with
smooth
fingers
,
symmetrically
turned
;
a
broad
ring
flashed
on
the
little
finger
,
and
stooping
forward
,
I
looked
at
it
,
and
saw
a
gem
I
had
seen
a
hundred
times
before
.
<EOS>
Again
I
looked
at
the
face
;
which
was
no
longer
turned
from
me
 
on
the
contrary
,
the
bonnet
was
doffed
,
the
bandage
displaced
,
the
head
advanced
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Jane
,
do
you
know
me
?
"
asked
the
familiar
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
take
off
the
red
cloak
,
sir
,
and
then
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
the
string
is
in
a
knot
 
<EOS>
help
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Break
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
then
 
"
Off
,
ye
lendings
!
"
<EOS>
"
And
Mr.
Rochester
stepped
out
of
his
disguise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
sir
,
what
a
strange
idea
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
well
carried
out
,
eh
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
the
ladies
you
must
have
managed
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
not
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
not
act
the
character
of
a
gipsy
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
character
did
I
act
?
<EOS>
My
own
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
some
unaccountable
one
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
believe
you
have
been
trying
to
draw
me
out
 
or
in
;
you
have
been
talking
nonsense
to
make
me
talk
nonsense
.
<EOS>
It
is
scarcely
fair
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
forgive
me
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
till
I
have
thought
it
all
over
.
<EOS>
If
,
on
reflection
,
I
find
I
have
fallen
into
no
great
absurdity
,
I
shall
try
to
forgive
you
;
but
it
was
not
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
have
been
very
correct
 
very
careful
,
very
sensible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
reflected
,
and
thought
,
on
the
whole
,
I
had
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
comfort
;
but
,
indeed
,
I
had
been
on
my
guard
almost
from
the
beginning
of
the
interview
.
<EOS>
Something
of
masquerade
I
suspected
.
<EOS>
I
knew
gipsies
and
fortune
-
tellers
did
not
express
themselves
as
this
seeming
old
woman
had
expressed
herself
;
besides
I
had
noted
her
feigned
voice
,
her
anxiety
to
conceal
her
features
.
<EOS>
But
my
mind
had
been
running
on
Grace
Poole
 
<EOS>
that
living
enigma
,
that
mystery
of
mysteries
,
as
I
considered
her
.
<EOS>
I
had
never
thought
of
Mr.
Rochester
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
he
,
"
what
are
you
musing
about
?
<EOS>
What
does
that
grave
smile
signify
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Wonder
and
self
-
congratulation
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
have
your
permission
to
retire
now
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
stay
a
moment
;
and
tell
me
what
the
people
in
the
drawing
-
room
yonder
are
doing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Discussing
the
gipsy
,
I
daresay
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Sit
down
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
hear
what
they
said
about
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
better
not
stay
long
,
sir
;
it
must
be
near
eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
are
you
aware
,
Mr.
Rochester
,
that
a
stranger
has
arrived
here
since
you
left
this
morning
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
stranger
!
 
<EOS>
no
;
who
can
it
be
?
<EOS>
I
expected
no
one
;
is
he
gone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
he
said
he
had
known
you
long
,
and
that
he
could
take
the
liberty
of
installing
himself
here
till
you
returned
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
The
devil
he
did
!
<EOS>
Did
he
give
his
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
name
is
Mason
,
sir
;
and
he
comes
from
the
West
Indies
;
from
Spanish
Town
,
in
Jamaica
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
was
standing
near
me
;
he
had
taken
my
hand
,
as
if
to
lead
me
to
a
chair
.
<EOS>
As
I
spoke
he
gave
my
wrist
a
convulsive
grip
;
the
smile
on
his
lips
froze
:
<EOS>
apparently
a
spasm
caught
his
breath
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mason
!
 
<EOS>
the
West
Indies
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
in
the
tone
one
might
fancy
a
speaking
automaton
to
enounce
its
single
words
;
"
Mason
!
 
<EOS>
the
West
Indies
!
"
<EOS>
he
reiterated
;
and
he
went
over
the
syllables
three
times
,
growing
,
in
the
intervals
of
speaking
,
whiter
than
ashes
:
<EOS>
he
hardly
seemed
to
know
what
he
was
doing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
feel
ill
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
I
've
got
a
blow
;
I
've
got
a
blow
,
Jane
!
"
<EOS>
He
staggered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
lean
on
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
you
offered
me
your
shoulder
once
before
;
let
me
have
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
yes
;
and
my
arm
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
sat
down
,
and
made
me
sit
beside
him
.
<EOS>
Holding
my
hand
in
both
his
own
,
he
chafed
it
;
gazing
on
me
,
at
the
same
time
,
with
the
most
troubled
and
dreary
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
little
friend
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
"
I
wish
I
were
in
a
quiet
island
with
only
you
;
and
trouble
,
and
danger
,
and
hideous
recollections
removed
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
help
you
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
I
'd
give
my
life
to
serve
you
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
if
aid
is
wanted
,
I
'll
seek
it
at
your
hands
;
I
promise
you
that

<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
what
to
do
,
 
I
'll
try
,
at
least
,
to
do
it
.

<EOS>
"
Fetch
me
now
,
Jane
,
a
glass
of
wine
from
the
dining
-
room
:
they
will
be
at
supper
there
;
and
tell
me
if
Mason
is
with
them
,
and
what
he
is
doing

"
  
<EOS>
I
went
.
<EOS>
I
found
all
the
party
in
the
dining
-
room
at
supper
,
as
Mr.
Rochester
had
said
;
they
were
not
seated
at
table
,
 
the
supper
was
arranged
on
the
sideboard
;
each
had
taken
what
he
chose
,
and
they
stood
about
here
and
there
in
groups
,
their
plates
and
glasses
in
their
hands
.
<EOS>
Every
one
seemed
in
high
glee
;
laughter
and
conversation
were
general
and
animated
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mason
stood
near
the
fire
,
talking
to
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Dent
,
and
appeared
as
merry
as
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
filled
a
wine
-
glass
<EOS>
(
I
saw
Miss
Ingram
watch
me
frowningly
as
I
did
so
<EOS>
:
she
thought
I
was
taking
a
liberty
,
I
daresay
)
,
and
I
returned
to
the
library
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
's
extreme
pallor
had
disappeared
,
and
he
looked
once
more
firm
and
stern
.
<EOS>
He
took
the
glass
from
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
is
to
your
health
,
ministrant
spirit
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
He
swallowed
the
contents
and
returned
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
What
are
they
doing
,
Jane
?
"
  
"
Laughing
and
talking
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
do
n't
look
grave
and
mysterious
,
as
if
they
had
heard
something
strange
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
:
they
are
full
of
jests
and
gaiety
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
Mason
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
laughing
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
all
these
people
came
in
a
body
and
spat
at
me
,
what
would
you
do
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Turn
them
out
of
the
room
,
sir
,
if
I
could
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
half
smiled
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
I
were
to
go
to
them
,
and
they
only
looked
at
me
coldly
,
and
whispered
sneeringly
amongst
each
other
,
and
then
dropped
off
and
left
me
one
by
one
,
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
Would
you
go
with
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
rather
think
not
,
sir
:
<EOS>
I
should
have
more
pleasure
in
staying
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
comfort
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
to
comfort
you
,
as
well
as
I
could
.
"
  
"
And
if
they
laid
you
under
a
ban
for
adhering
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
,
probably
,
should
know
nothing
about
their
ban
;
and
if
I
did
,
I
should
care
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
you
could
dare
censure
for
my
sake
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
dare
it
for
the
sake
of
any
friend
who
deserved
my
adherence
;
as
you
,
I
am
sure
,
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
back
now
into
the
room
;
step
quietly
up
to
Mason
,
and
whisper
in
his
ear
that
Mr.
Rochester
is
come
and
wishes
to
see
him
:
show
him
in
here
and
then
leave
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
his
behest
.
<EOS>
The
company
all
stared
at
me
as
I
passed
straight
among
them
.
<EOS>
I
sought
Mr.
Mason
,
delivered
the
message
,
and
preceded
him
from
the
room
:
I
ushered
him
into
the
library
,
and
then
I
went
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
At
a
late
hour
,
after
I
had
been
in
bed
some
time
,
I
heard
the
visitors
repair
to
their
chambers
:
I
distinguished
Mr.
Rochester
's
voice
,
and
heard
him
say
,
"
This
way
,
Mason
;
this
is
your
room
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
spoke
cheerfully
:
<EOS>
the
gay
tones
set
my
heart
at
ease
.
<EOS>
I
was
soon
asleep
.
    
<EOS>
I
had
forgotten
to
draw
my
curtain
,
which
I
usually
did
,
and
also
to
let
down
my
window
-
blind
.
<EOS>
The
consequence
was
,
that
when
the
moon
,
which
was
full
and
bright
(
for
the
night
was
fine
)
,
came
in
her
course
to
that
space
in
the
sky
opposite
my
casement
,
and
looked
in
at
me
through
the
unveiled
panes
,
her
glorious
gaze
roused
me
.
<EOS>
Awaking
in
the
dead
of
night
,
I
opened
my
eyes
on
her
disk
 
silver
-
white
and
crystal
clear
.
<EOS>
It
was
beautiful
,
but
too
solemn
;
I
half
rose
,
and
stretched
my
arm
to
draw
the
curtain
.
  
<EOS>
Good
God
!
<EOS>
What
a
cry
!
  
<EOS>
The
night
 
its
silence
 
its
rest
,
was
rent
in
twain
by
a
savage
,
a
sharp
,
a
shrilly
sound
that
ran
from
end
to
end
of
Thornfield
Hall
.
  
<EOS>
My
pulse
stopped
:
my
heart
stood
still
;
my
stretched
arm
was
paralysed
.
<EOS>
The
cry
died
,
and
was
not
renewed
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
whatever
being
uttered
that
fearful
shriek
could
not
soon
repeat
it
:
not
the
widest
-
winged
condor
on
the
Andes
could
,
twice
in
succession
,
send
out
such
a
yell
from
the
cloud
shrouding
his
eyrie
.
<EOS>
The
thing
delivering
such
utterance
must
rest
ere
it
could
repeat
the
effort
.
  
<EOS>
It
came
out
of
the
third
storey
;
for
it
passed
overhead
.
<EOS>
And
overhead
 
yes
,
in
the
room
just
above
my
chamber
-
ceiling
 
<EOS>
I
now
heard
a
struggle
:
<EOS>
a
deadly
one
it
seemed
from
the
noise
;
and
a
half
-
smothered
voice
shouted
    
"
Help
!
<EOS>
help
!
<EOS>
help
!
"
<EOS>
three
times
rapidly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
no
one
come
?
"
<EOS>
it
cried
;
and
then
,
while
the
staggering
and
stamping
went
on
wildly
,
<EOS>
I
distinguished
through
plank
and
plaster
:
    
"
Rochester
!
<EOS>
Rochester
!
<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
,
come
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
chamber
-
door
opened
:
some
one
ran
,
or
rushed
,
along
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
Another
step
stamped
on
the
flooring
above
and
something
fell
;
and
there
was
silence
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
put
on
some
clothes
,
though
horror
shook
all
my
limbs
;
I
issued
from
my
apartment
.
<EOS>
The
sleepers
were
all
aroused
:
ejaculations
,
terrified
murmurs
sounded
in
every
room
;
door
after
door
unclosed
;
one
looked
out
and
another
looked
out
;
the
gallery
filled
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
and
ladies
alike
had
quitted
their
beds
;
and
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
what
is
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
hurt
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
has
happened
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Fetch
a
light
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
fire
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
there
robbers
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
shall
we
run
?
"
was
demanded
confusedly
on
all
hands
.
<EOS>
But
for
the
moonlight
they
would
have
been
in
complete
darkness
.
<EOS>
They
ran
to
and
fro
;
they
crowded
together
:
<EOS>
some
sobbed
,
some
stumbled
:
the
confusion
was
inextricable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
the
devil
is
Rochester
?
"
cried
Colonel
Dent
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
find
him
in
his
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Here
!
<EOS>
here
!
"
was
shouted
in
return
.
"
<EOS>
Be
composed
,
all
of
you
:
I
'm
coming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
opened
,
and
Mr.
Rochester
advanced
with
a
candle
:
he
had
just
descended
from
the
upper
storey
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
ladies
ran
to
him
directly
;
she
seized
his
arm
:
it
was
Miss
Ingram
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
awful
event
has
taken
place
?
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Speak
!
<EOS>
let
us
know
the
worst
at
once
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
do
n't
pull
me
down
or
strangle
me
,
"
he
replied
:
for
the
Misses
Eshton
were
clinging
about
him
now
;
and
the
two
dowagers
,
in
vast
white
wrappers
,
were
bearing
down
on
him
like
ships
in
full
sail
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
's
right
!
 
<EOS>
all
's
right
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
mere
rehearsal
of
Much
Ado
about
Nothing
.
<EOS>
Ladies
,
keep
off
,
or
I
shall
wax
dangerous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
dangerous
he
looked
:
<EOS>
his
black
eyes
darted
sparks
.
<EOS>
Calming
himself
by
an
effort
,
he
added
    
"
A
servant
has
had
the
nightmare
;
that
is
all
.
<EOS>
She
's
an
excitable
,
nervous
person
:
she
construed
her
dream
into
an
apparition
,
or
something
of
that
sort
,
no
doubt
;
and
has
taken
a
fit
with
fright
.
<EOS>
Now
,
then
,
I
must
see
you
all
back
into
your
rooms
;
for
,
till
the
house
is
settled
,
she
can
not
be
looked
after
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
have
the
goodness
to
set
the
ladies
the
example
.
<EOS>
Miss
Ingram
,
I
am
sure
you
will
not
fail
in
evincing
superiority
to
idle
terrors
.
<EOS>
Amy
and
Louisa
,
return
to
your
nests
like
a
pair
of
doves
,
as
you
are
.
<EOS>
Mesdames
"
(
to
the
dowagers
)
,
"
you
will
take
cold
to
a
dead
certainty
,
if
you
stay
in
this
chill
gallery
any
longer
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
,
by
dint
of
alternate
coaxing
and
commanding
,
he
contrived
to
get
them
all
once
more
enclosed
in
their
separate
dormitories
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
wait
to
be
ordered
back
to
mine
,
but
retreated
unnoticed
,
as
unnoticed
I
had
left
it
.
  
<EOS>
Not
,
however
,
to
go
to
bed
:
on
the
contrary
,
I
began
and
dressed
myself
carefully
.
<EOS>
The
sounds
I
had
heard
after
the
scream
,
and
the
words
that
had
been
uttered
,
had
probably
been
heard
only
by
me
;
for
they
had
proceeded
from
the
room
above
mine
:
but
they
assured
me
that
it
was
not
a
servant
's
dream
which
had
thus
struck
horror
through
the
house
;
and
that
the
explanation
Mr.
Rochester
had
given
was
merely
an
invention
framed
to
pacify
his
guests
.
<EOS>
I
dressed
,
then
,
to
be
ready
for
emergencies
.
<EOS>
When
dressed
,
I
sat
a
long
time
by
the
window
looking
out
over
the
silent
grounds
and
silvered
fields
and
waiting
for
I
knew
not
what
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
me
that
some
event
must
follow
the
strange
cry
,
struggle
,
and
call
.
  
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
:
stillness
returned
:
each
murmur
and
movement
ceased
gradually
,
and
in
about
an
hour
Thornfield
Hall
was
again
as
hushed
as
a
desert
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
that
sleep
and
night
had
resumed
their
empire
.
<EOS>
Meantime
the
moon
declined
:
she
was
about
to
set
.
<EOS>
Not
liking
to
sit
in
the
cold
and
darkness
,
I
thought
I
would
lie
down
on
my
bed
,
dressed
as
I
was
.
<EOS>
I
left
the
window
,
and
moved
with
little
noise
across
the
carpet
;
as
I
stooped
to
take
off
my
shoes
,
a
cautious
hand
tapped
low
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
wanted
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
up
?
"
asked
the
voice
I
expected
to
hear
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
<EOS>
my
master
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
dressed
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
out
,
then
,
quietly
.
"
  
I
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
stood
in
the
gallery
holding
a
light
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
,
"
he
said
:
"
come
this
way
:
take
your
time
,
and
make
no
noise
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
slippers
were
thin
:
I
could
walk
the
matted
floor
as
softly
as
a
cat
.
<EOS>
He
glided
up
the
gallery
and
up
the
stairs
,
and
stopped
in
the
dark
,
low
corridor
of
the
fateful
third
storey
:
<EOS>
I
had
followed
and
stood
at
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
a
sponge
in
your
room
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
salts
 
volatile
salts
?
"
  
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
back
and
fetch
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
returned
,
sought
the
sponge
on
the
washstand
,
the
salts
in
my
drawer
,
and
once
more
retraced
my
steps
.
<EOS>
He
still
waited
;
he
held
a
key
in
his
hand
:
approaching
one
of
the
small
,
black
doors
<EOS>
,
he
put
it
in
the
lock
;
he
paused
,
and
addressed
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
turn
sick
at
the
sight
of
blood
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
not
:
I
have
never
been
tried
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
felt
a
thrill
while
I
answered
him
;
but
no
coldness
,
and
no
faintness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Just
give
me
your
hand
,
"
he
said
:
"
it
will
not
do
to
risk
a
fainting
fit
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
put
my
fingers
into
his
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Warm
and
steady
,
"
was
his
remark
:
he
turned
the
key
and
opened
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
a
room
I
remembered
to
have
seen
before
,
the
day
Mrs.
Fairfax
showed
me
over
the
house
:
it
was
hung
with
tapestry
;
but
the
tapestry
was
now
looped
up
in
one
part
,
and
there
was
a
door
apparent
,
which
had
then
been
concealed
.
<EOS>
This
door
was
open
;
a
light
shone
out
of
the
room
within
<EOS>
:
I
heard
thence
a
snarling
,
snatching
sound
,
almost
like
a
dog
quarrelling
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
,
putting
down
his
candle
,
said
to
me
,
"
Wait
a
minute
,
"
and
he
went
forward
to
the
inner
apartment
.
<EOS>
A
shout
of
laughter
greeted
his
entrance
;
noisy
at
first
,
and
terminating
in
Grace
Poole
's
own
goblin
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
then
was
there
.
<EOS>
He
made
some
sort
of
arrangement
without
speaking
,
though
I
heard
a
low
voice
address
him
:
he
came
out
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
Jane
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
;
and
I
walked
round
to
the
other
side
of
a
large
bed
,
which
with
its
drawn
curtains
concealed
a
considerable
portion
of
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
An
easy
-
chair
was
near
the
bed
-
head
:
a
man
sat
in
it
,
dressed
with
the
exception
of
his
coat
;
he
was
still
;
his
head
leant
back
;
his
eyes
were
closed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
held
the
candle
over
him
;
I
recognised
in
his
pale
and
seemingly
lifeless
<EOS>
face
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
,
Mason
<EOS>
:
I
saw
too
that
his
linen
on
one
side
,
and
one
arm
,
was
almost
soaked
in
blood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hold
the
candle
,
"
said
Mr.
Rochester
,
and
<EOS>
I
took
it
:
he
fetched
a
basin
of
water
from
the
washstand
:
"
Hold
that
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
I
obeyed
.
<EOS>
He
took
the
sponge
,
dipped
it
in
,
and
moistened
the
corpse
-
like
face
;
he
asked
for
my
smelling
-
bottle
,
and
applied
it
to
the
nostrils
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mason
shortly
unclosed
his
eyes
;
he
groaned
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
opened
the
shirt
of
the
wounded
man
,
whose
arm
and
shoulder
were
bandaged
:
he
sponged
away
blood
,
trickling
fast
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
immediate
danger
?
"
murmured
Mr.
Mason
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
<EOS>
No
 
a
mere
scratch
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
so
overcome
,
man
<EOS>
:
bear
up
!
<EOS>
I
'll
fetch
a
surgeon
for
you
now
,
myself
:
you
'll
be
able
to
be
removed
by
morning
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
Jane
,
"
he
continued
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
to
leave
you
in
this
room
with
this
gentleman
,
for
an
hour
,
or
perhaps
two
hours
:
you
will
sponge
the
blood
as
I
do
when
it
returns
:
if
he
feels
faint
,
you
will
put
the
glass
of
water
on
that
stand
to
his
lips
,
and
your
salts
to
his
nose
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
speak
to
him
on
any
pretext
 
and
 
Richard
,
it
will
be
at
the
peril
of
your
life
if
you
speak
to
her
:
open
your
lips
 
<EOS>
agitate
yourself
 
<EOS>
and
I
'll
not
answer
for
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Again
the
poor
man
groaned
;
he
looked
as
if
he
dared
not
move
;
fear
,
either
of
death
or
of
something
else
,
appeared
almost
to
paralyse
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
put
the
now
bloody
sponge
into
my
hand
,
and
I
proceeded
to
use
it
as
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
He
watched
me
a
second
,
then
saying
,
"
Remember
!
 
<EOS>
No
conversation
,
"
he
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
experienced
a
strange
feeling
as
the
key
grated
in
the
lock
,
and
the
sound
of
his
retreating
step
ceased
to
be
heard
.
  
<EOS>
Here
then
I
was
in
the
third
storey
,
fastened
into
one
of
its
mystic
cells
;
night
around
me
;
a
pale
and
bloody
spectacle
under
my
eyes
and
hands
;
a
murderess
hardly
separated
from
me
by
a
single
door
:
yes
 
that
was
appalling
 
the
rest
I
could
bear
;
but
I
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
Grace
Poole
bursting
out
upon
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
keep
to
my
post
,
however
.
<EOS>
I
must
watch
this
ghastly
countenance
 
<EOS>
these
blue
,
still
lips
forbidden
to
unclose
 
these
eyes
now
shut
,
now
opening
,
now
wandering
through
the
room
,
now
fixing
on
me
,
and
ever
glazed
with
the
dulness
of
horror
.
<EOS>
I
must
dip
my
hand
again
and
again
in
the
basin
of
blood
and
water
,
and
wipe
away
the
trickling
gore
.
<EOS>
I
must
see
the
light
of
the
unsnuffed
candle
wane
on
my
employment
;
the
shadows
darken
on
the
wrought
,
antique
tapestry
round
me
,
and
grow
black
under
the
hangings
of
the
vast
old
bed
,
and
quiver
strangely
over
the
doors
of
a
great
cabinet
opposite
 
whose
front
,
divided
into
twelve
panels
,
bore
,
in
grim
design
,
the
heads
of
the
twelve
apostles
,
each
enclosed
in
its
separate
panel
as
in
a
frame
;
while
above
them
at
the
top
rose
an
ebon
crucifix
and
a
dying
Christ
.
  
<EOS>
According
as
the
shifting
obscurity
and
flickering
gleam
hovered
here
or
glanced
there
,
it
was
now
the
bearded
physician
,
Luke
,
that
bent
his
brow
;
now
St.
John
's
long
hair
that
waved
;
and
anon
the
devilish
face
of
Judas
,
that
grew
out
of
the
panel
,
and
seemed
gathering
life
and
threatening
a
revelation
of
the
arch
-
traitor
 
of
Satan
himself
 
in
his
subordinate
's
form
.
  
<EOS>
Amidst
all
this
,
I
had
to
listen
as
well
as
watch
:
to
listen
for
the
movements
of
the
wild
beast
or
the
fiend
in
yonder
side
den
.
<EOS>
But
since
Mr.
Rochester
's
visit
it
seemed
spellbound
:
all
the
night
I
heard
but
three
sounds
at
three
long
intervals
,
 
a
step
creak
,
a
momentary
renewal
of
the
snarling
,
canine
noise
,
and
a
deep
human
groan
.
  
<EOS>
Then
my
own
thoughts
worried
me
.
<EOS>
What
crime
was
this
that
lived
incarnate
in
this
sequestered
mansion
,
and
could
neither
be
expelled
nor
subdued
by
the
owner
?
 
<EOS>
what
mystery
,
that
broke
out
now
in
fire
and
now
in
blood
,
at
the
deadest
hours
of
night
?
<EOS>
What
creature
was
it
,
that
,
masked
in
an
ordinary
woman
's
face
and
shape
,
uttered
the
voice
,
now
of
a
mocking
demon
,
and
anon
of
a
carrion
-
seeking
bird
of
prey
?
  
<EOS>
And
this
man
I
bent
over
 
this
commonplace
,
quiet
stranger
 
<EOS>
how
had
he
become
involved
in
the
web
of
horror
?
<EOS>
and
why
had
the
Fury
flown
at
him
?
<EOS>
What
made
him
seek
this
quarter
of
the
house
at
an
untimely
season
,
when
he
should
have
been
asleep
in
bed
?
<EOS>
I
had
heard
Mr.
Rochester
assign
him
an
apartment
below
 
<EOS>
what
brought
him
here
!
<EOS>
And
why
,
now
,
was
he
so
tame
under
the
violence
or
treachery
<EOS>
done
him
?
<EOS>
Why
did
he
so
quietly
submit
to
the
concealment
Mr.
Rochester
enforced
?
<EOS>
Why
_
did
_
Mr.
Rochester
enforce
this
concealment
?
<EOS>
His
guest
had
been
outraged
,
his
own
life
on
a
former
occasion
had
been
hideously
plotted
against
;
and
both
attempts
he
smothered
in
secrecy
and
sank
in
oblivion
!
<EOS>
Lastly
,
I
saw
Mr.
Mason
was
submissive
to
Mr.
Rochester
;
that
the
impetuous
will
of
the
latter
held
complete
sway
over
the
inertness
of
the
former
:
the
few
words
which
had
passed
between
them
assured
me
of
this
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
that
in
their
former
intercourse
,
the
passive
disposition
of
the
one
had
been
habitually
influenced
by
the
active
energy
of
the
other
:
whence
then
had
arisen
Mr.
Rochester
's
dismay
when
he
heard
of
Mr.
Mason
's
arrival
?
<EOS>
Why
had
the
mere
name
of
this
unresisting
individual
 
<EOS>
whom
his
word
now
sufficed
to
control
like
a
child
 
<EOS>
fallen
on
him
,
a
few
hours
since
,
as
a
thunderbolt
might
fall
on
an
oak
?
  
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
could
not
forget
his
look
and
his
paleness
when
he
whispered
:
"
Jane
,
I
have
got
a
blow
 
<EOS>
I
have
got
a
blow
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
forget
how
the
arm
had
trembled
which
he
rested
on
my
shoulder
:
and
it
was
no
light
matter
which
could
thus
bow
the
resolute
spirit
and
thrill
the
vigorous
frame
of
Fairfax
Rochester
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
will
he
come
?
<EOS>
When
will
he
come
?
<EOS>
"
I
cried
inwardly
,
as
the
night
lingered
and
lingered
 
as
my
bleeding
patient
drooped
,
moaned
,
sickened
:
and
neither
day
nor
aid
arrived
.
<EOS>
I
had
,
again
and
again
,
held
the
water
to
Mason
's
white
lips
;
again
and
again
offered
him
the
stimulating
salts
:
my
efforts
seemed
ineffectual
:
either
bodily
or
mental
suffering
,
or
loss
of
blood
,
or
all
three
combined
,
were
fast
prostrating
his
strength
.
<EOS>
He
moaned
so
,
and
looked
so
weak
,
wild
,
and
lost
,
I
feared
he
was
dying
;
and
I
might
not
even
speak
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
candle
,
wasted
at
last
,
went
out
;
as
it
expired
,
I
perceived
streaks
of
grey
light
edging
the
window
curtains
:
dawn
was
then
approaching
.
<EOS>
Presently
I
heard
Pilot
bark
far
below
,
out
of
his
distant
kennel
in
the
courtyard
:
hope
revived
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
unwarranted
:
in
five
minutes
more
the
grating
key
,
the
yielding
lock
,
warned
me
my
watch
was
relieved
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
have
lasted
more
than
two
hours
:
many
a
week
has
seemed
shorter
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
entered
,
and
with
him
the
surgeon
he
had
been
to
fetch
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Carter
,
be
on
the
alert
,
"
he
said
to
this
last
:
"
I
give
you
but
half
-
an
-
hour
for
dressing
the
wound
,
fastening
the
bandages
,
getting
the
patient
downstairs
and
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
is
he
fit
to
move
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
of
it
;
it
is
nothing
serious
;
he
is
nervous
,
his
spirits
must
be
kept
up
.
<EOS>
Come
,
set
to
work
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
drew
back
the
thick
curtain
,
drew
up
the
holland
blind
,
let
in
all
the
daylight
he
could
;
and
I
was
surprised
and
cheered
to
see
how
far
dawn
was
advanced
:
what
rosy
streaks
were
beginning
to
brighten
the
east
.
<EOS>
Then
he
approached
Mason
,
whom
the
surgeon
was
already
handling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
good
fellow
,
how
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
done
for
me
,
I
fear
,
"
was
the
faint
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
whit
!
 
<EOS>
courage
!
<EOS>
This
day
fortnight
you
'll
hardly
be
a
pin
the
worse
of
it
:
you
've
lost
a
little
blood
;
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
Carter
,
assure
him
there
's
no
danger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
that
conscientiously
,
"
said
Carter
,
who
had
now
undone
the
bandages
;
"
only
I
wish
I
could
have
got
here
sooner
<EOS>
:
he
would
not
have
bled
so
much
 
<EOS>
but
how
is
this
?
<EOS>
The
flesh
on
the
shoulder
is
torn
as
well
as
cut
.
<EOS>
This
wound
was
not
done
with
a
knife
:
there
have
been
teeth
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
bit
me
,
"
he
murmured
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
worried
me
like
a
tigress
,
when
Rochester
got
the
knife
from
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
not
have
yielded
:
you
should
have
grappled
with
her
at
once
,
"
said
Mr.
Rochester
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
under
such
circumstances
,
what
could
one
do
?
"
returned
Mason
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
was
frightful
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
shuddering
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
did
not
expect
it
:
she
looked
so
quiet
at
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
warned
you
,
"
was
his
friend
's
answer
;
"
I
said
 
be
on
your
guard
when
you
go
near
her
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
you
might
have
waited
till
to
-
morrow
,
and
had
me
with
you
:
it
was
mere
folly
to
attempt
the
interview
to
-
night
,
and
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
could
have
done
some
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
thought
!
<EOS>
you
thought
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
it
makes
me
impatient
to
hear
you
:
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
you
have
suffered
,
and
are
likely
to
suffer
enough
for
not
taking
my
advice
;
so
I
'll
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
Carter
 
hurry
!
 
<EOS>
hurry
!
<EOS>
The
sun
will
soon
rise
,
and
I
must
have
him
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Directly
,
sir
;
the
shoulder
is
just
bandaged
.
<EOS>
I
must
look
to
this
other
wound
in
the
arm
:
she
has
had
her
teeth
here
too
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
sucked
the
blood
:
she
said
she
'd
drain
my
heart
,
"
said
Mason
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
Mr.
Rochester
shudder
:
a
singularly
marked
expression
of
disgust
,
horror
,
hatred
,
warped
his
countenance
almost
to
distortion
;
but
he
only
said
    
"
Come
,
be
silent
,
Richard
,
and
never
mind
her
gibberish
:
do
n't
repeat
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
forget
it
,
"
was
the
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
when
you
are
out
of
the
country
:
when
you
get
back
to
Spanish
Town
,
you
may
think
of
her
as
dead
and
buried
 
or
rather
,
you
need
not
think
of
her
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Impossible
to
forget
this
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
impossible
:
have
some
energy
,
man
.
<EOS>
You
thought
you
were
as
dead
as
a
herring
two
hours
since
,
and
you
are
all
alive
and
talking
now
.
<EOS>
There
!
 
<EOS>
Carter
has
done
with
you
or
nearly
so
;
I
'll
make
you
decent
in
a
trice
.
<EOS>
Jane
"
<EOS>
(
he
turned
to
me
for
the
first
time
since
his
re
-
entrance
)
,
"
take
this
key
:
go
down
into
my
bedroom
,
and
walk
straight
forward
into
my
dressing
-
room
:
open
the
top
drawer
of
the
wardrobe
and
take
out
a
clean
shirt
and
neck
-
handkerchief
:
bring
them
here
;
and
be
nimble
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
went
;
sought
the
repository
he
had
mentioned
,
found
the
articles
named
,
and
returned
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
he
,
"
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
bed
while
I
order
his
toilet
;
but
do
n't
leave
the
room
:
you
may
be
wanted
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
retired
as
directed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
anybody
stirring
below
when
you
went
down
,
Jane
?
"
inquired
Mr.
Rochester
presently
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
;
all
was
very
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
get
you
off
cannily
,
Dick
:
and
it
will
be
better
,
both
for
your
sake
,
and
for
that
of
the
poor
creature
in
yonder
.
<EOS>
I
have
striven
long
to
avoid
exposure
,
and
I
should
not
like
it
to
come
at
last
.
<EOS>
Here
,
Carter
,
help
him
on
with
his
waist
-
coat
.
<EOS>
Where
did
you
leave
your
furred
cloak
?
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
travel
a
mile
without
that
,
I
know
,
in
this
damned
cold
climate
.
<EOS>
In
your
room
?
 
<EOS>
Jane
,
run
down
to
Mr.
Mason
's
room
,
 
the
one
next
mine
,
 
and
fetch
a
cloak
you
will
see
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
I
ran
,
and
again
returned
,
bearing
an
immense
mantle
lined
and
edged
with
fur
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
've
another
errand
for
you
,
"
said
my
untiring
master
;
<EOS>
"
you
must
away
to
my
room
again
.
<EOS>
What
a
mercy
you
are
shod
with
velvet
,
Jane
!
 
<EOS>
a
clod
-
hopping
messenger
would
never
do
at
this
juncture
.
<EOS>
You
must
open
the
middle
drawer
of
my
toilet
-
table
and
take
out
a
little
phial
and
a
little
glass
you
will
find
there
,
 
quick
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
flew
thither
and
back
,
bringing
the
desired
vessels
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
!
<EOS>
Now
,
doctor
,
I
shall
take
the
liberty
of
administering
a
dose
myself
,
on
my
own
responsibility
.
<EOS>
I
got
this
cordial
at
Rome
,
of
an
Italian
charlatan
 
<EOS>
a
fellow
you
would
have
kicked
,
Carter
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
a
thing
to
be
used
indiscriminately
,
but
it
is
good
upon
occasion
:
as
now
,
for
instance
.
<EOS>
Jane
,
a
little
water
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
held
out
the
tiny
glass
,
and
I
half
filled
it
from
the
water
-
bottle
on
the
washstand
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
will
do
;
 
now
wet
the
lip
of
the
phial
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
so
;
he
measured
twelve
drops
of
a
crimson
liquid
,
and
presented
it
to
Mason
.
  
<EOS>
"
Drink
,
Richard
:
it
will
give
you
the
heart
you
lack
,
for
an
hour
or
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
will
it
hurt
me
?
 
<EOS>
is
it
inflammatory
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Drink
!
drink
!
<EOS>
drink
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Mason
obeyed
,
because
it
was
evidently
useless
to
resist
.
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
now
:
he
still
looked
pale
,
but
he
was
no
longer
gory
and
sullied
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
let
him
sit
three
minutes
after
he
had
swallowed
the
liquid
;
he
then
took
his
arm
    
"
<EOS>
Now
I
am
sure
you
can
get
on
your
feet
,
"
he
said
 
"
try
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
patient
rose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Carter
,
take
him
under
the
other
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Be
of
good
cheer
,
Richard
;
step
out
 
that
's
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
feel
better
,
"
remarked
Mr.
Mason
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
do
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Jane
,
trip
on
before
us
away
to
the
backstairs
;
unbolt
the
side
-
passage
door
,
and
tell
the
driver
of
the
post
-
chaise
you
will
see
in
the
yard
 
or
just
outside
,
for
I
told
him
not
to
drive
his
rattling
wheels
over
the
pavement
 
to
be
ready
;
we
are
coming
:
and
,
Jane
,
if
any
one
is
about
,
come
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
hem
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
by
this
time
half
-
past
five
,
and
the
sun
was
on
the
point
of
rising
;
but
I
found
the
kitchen
still
dark
and
silent
.
<EOS>
The
side
-
passage
door
was
fastened
;
I
opened
it
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
:
all
the
yard
was
quiet
;
but
the
gates
stood
wide
open
,
and
there
was
a
post
-
chaise
,
with
horses
ready
harnessed
,
and
driver
seated
on
the
box
,
stationed
outside
.
<EOS>
I
approached
him
,
and
said
the
gentlemen
were
coming
;
he
nodded
:
then
I
looked
carefully
round
and
listened
.
<EOS>
The
stillness
of
early
morning
slumbered
everywhere
;
the
curtains
were
yet
drawn
over
the
servants
'
chamber
windows
;
little
birds
were
just
twittering
in
the
blossom
-
blanched
orchard
trees
,
whose
boughs
drooped
like
white
garlands
over
the
wall
enclosing
one
side
of
the
yard
;
the
carriage
horses
stamped
from
time
to
time
in
their
closed
stables
:
all
else
was
still
.
  
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
now
appeared
.
<EOS>
Mason
,
supported
by
Mr.
Rochester
and
the
surgeon
,
seemed
to
walk
with
tolerable
ease
:
they
assisted
him
into
the
chaise
;
Carter
followed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
care
of
him
,
"
said
Mr.
Rochester
to
the
latter
,
"
and
keep
him
at
your
house
till
he
is
quite
well
:
I
shall
ride
over
in
a
day
or
two
to
see
how
he
gets
on
.
<EOS>
Richard
,
how
is
it
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
fresh
air
revives
me
,
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
the
window
open
on
his
side
,
Carter
;
there
is
no
wind
 
good
-
bye
,
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fairfax
 
"
  
"
Well
what
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
her
be
taken
care
of
;
let
her
be
treated
as
tenderly
as
may
be
:
let
her
 
"
he
stopped
and
burst
into
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
my
best
;
and
have
done
it
,
and
will
do
it
,
"
was
the
answer
:
he
shut
up
the
chaise
door
,
and
the
vehicle
drove
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
would
to
God
<EOS>
there
was
an
end
of
all
this
!
"
<EOS>
added
Mr.
Rochester
,
as
he
closed
and
barred
the
heavy
yard
-
gates
.
  
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
moved
with
slow
step
and
abstracted
air
towards
a
door
in
the
wall
bordering
the
orchard
.
<EOS>
I
,
supposing
he
had
done
with
me
,
prepared
to
return
to
the
house
;
again
,
however
,
I
heard
him
call
"
Jane
!
"
<EOS>
He
had
opened
the
portal
and
stood
at
it
,
waiting
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
where
there
is
some
freshness
,
for
a
few
moments
,
"
he
said
;
"
that
house
is
a
mere
dungeon
:
do
n't
you
feel
it
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
me
a
splendid
mansion
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
glamour
of
inexperience
is
over
your
eyes
,
"
he
answered
;
"
and
you
see
it
through
a
charmed
medium
:
you
can
not
discern
that
the
gilding
is
slime
and
the
silk
draperies
cobwebs
;
that
the
marble
is
sordid
slate
,
and
the
polished
woods
mere
refuse
chips
and
scaly
bark
.
<EOS>
Now
_
here
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
(
he
pointed
to
the
leafy
enclosure
we
had
entered
)
"
<EOS>
all
is
real
,
sweet
,
and
pure
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
strayed
down
a
walk
edged
with
box
,
with
apple
trees
,
pear
trees
,
and
cherry
trees
on
one
side
,
and
a
border
on
the
other
full
of
all
sorts
of
old
-
fashioned
flowers
,
stocks
,
sweet
-
williams
,
primroses
,
pansies
,
mingled
with
southernwood
,
sweet
-
briar
,
and
various
fragrant
herbs
.
<EOS>
They
were
fresh
now
as
a
succession
of
April
showers
and
gleams
,
followed
by
a
lovely
spring
morning
,
could
make
them
:
the
sun
was
just
entering
the
dappled
east
,
and
his
light
illumined
the
wreathed
and
dewy
orchard
trees
and
shone
down
the
quiet
walks
under
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
will
you
have
a
flower
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
gathered
a
half
-
blown
rose
,
the
first
on
the
bush
,
and
offered
it
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
like
this
sunrise
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
That
sky
with
its
high
and
light
clouds
which
are
sure
to
melt
away
as
the
day
waxes
warm
 
this
placid
and
balmly
atmosphere
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
passed
a
strange
night
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
has
made
you
look
pale
 
were
you
afraid
when
I
left
you
alone
with
Mason
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
afraid
of
some
one
coming
out
of
the
inner
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
had
fastened
the
door
 
<EOS>
I
had
the
key
in
my
pocket
<EOS>
:
I
should
have
been
a
careless
shepherd
if
I
had
left
a
lamb
 
my
pet
lamb
 
so
near
a
wolf
's
den
,
unguarded
:
<EOS>
you
were
safe
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
Grace
Poole
live
here
still
,
sir
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
!
<EOS>
do
n't
trouble
your
head
about
her
 
<EOS>
put
the
thing
out
of
your
thoughts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
it
seems
to
me
your
life
is
hardly
secure
while
she
stays
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
fear
 
I
will
take
care
of
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
the
danger
you
apprehended
last
night
gone
by
now
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
vouch
for
that
till
Mason
is
out
of
England
:
nor
even
then
.
<EOS>
To
live
,
for
me
,
Jane
,
is
to
stand
on
a
crater
-
crust
which
may
crack
and
spue
fire
any
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Mr.
Mason
seems
a
man
easily
led
.
<EOS>
Your
influence
,
sir
,
is
evidently
potent
with
him
:
he
will
never
set
you
at
defiance
or
wilfully
injure
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
Mason
will
not
defy
me
;
nor
,
knowing
it
,
will
he
hurt
me
 
<EOS>
but
,
unintentionally
,
he
might
in
a
moment
,
by
one
careless
word
,
deprive
me
,
if
not
of
life
,
yet
for
ever
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
to
be
cautious
,
sir
:
let
him
know
what
you
fear
,
and
show
him
how
to
avert
the
danger
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
laughed
sardonically
,
hastily
took
my
hand
,
and
as
hastily
threw
it
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
could
do
that
,
simpleton
,
where
would
the
danger
be
?
<EOS>
Annihilated
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
I
have
known
Mason
,
I
have
only
had
to
say
to
him
"
Do
that
,
"
and
the
thing
has
been
done
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
give
him
orders
in
this
case
:
I
can
not
say
"
Beware
of
harming
me
,
Richard
;
"
for
it
is
imperative
that
I
should
keep
him
ignorant
that
harm
to
me
is
possible
.
<EOS>
Now
you
look
puzzled
;
and
I
will
puzzle
you
further
.
<EOS>
You
are
my
little
friend
,
are
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
to
serve
you
,
sir
,
and
to
obey
you
in
all
that
is
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Precisely
:
I
see
you
do
.
<EOS>
I
see
genuine
contentment
in
your
gait
and
mien
,
your
eye
and
face
,
when
you
are
helping
me
and
pleasing
me
 
working
for
me
,
and
with
me
,
in
,
as
you
characteristically
say
,
"
_
all
that
is
right
_
:
<EOS>
"
for
if
I
bid
you
do
what
you
thought
wrong
,
there
would
be
no
light
-
footed
running
,
no
neat
-
handed
alacrity
,
no
lively
glance
and
animated
complexion
.
<EOS>
My
friend
would
then
turn
to
me
,
quiet
and
pale
,
and
would
say
,
"
No
,
sir
;
that
is
impossible
:
I
can
not
do
it
,
because
it
is
wrong
;
"
and
would
become
immutable
as
a
fixed
star
.
<EOS>
Well
,
you
too
have
power
over
me
,
and
may
injure
me
:
yet
I
dare
not
show
you
where
I
am
vulnerable
,
lest
,
faithful
and
friendly
as
you
are
,
you
should
transfix
me
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
no
more
to
fear
from
Mr.
Mason
than
you
have
from
me
,
sir
,
you
are
very
safe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
grant
it
may
be
so
!
<EOS>
Here
,
Jane
,
is
an
arbour
;
sit
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
arbour
was
an
arch
in
the
wall
,
lined
with
ivy
;
it
contained
a
rustic
seat
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
took
it
,
leaving
room
,
however
,
for
me
:
but
I
stood
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
,
"
he
said
;
"
the
bench
is
long
enough
for
two
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
hesitate
to
take
a
place
at
my
side
,
do
you
?
<EOS>
Is
that
wrong
,
Jane
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
answered
him
by
assuming
it
:
to
refuse
would
,
I
felt
,
have
been
unwise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
little
friend
,
while
the
sun
drinks
the
dew
 
while
all
the
flowers
in
this
old
garden
awake
and
expand
,
and
the
birds
fetch
their
young
ones
'
breakfast
out
of
the
Thornfield
,
and
the
early
bees
do
their
first
spell
of
work
 
<EOS>
I
'll
put
a
case
to
you
,
which
you
must
endeavour
to
suppose
your
own
:
<EOS>
but
first
,
look
at
me
,
and
tell
me
you
are
at
ease
,
and
not
fearing
that
I
err
in
detaining
you
,
or
that
you
err
in
staying
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
;
I
am
content
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
Jane
,
call
to
aid
your
fancy
:
 
suppose
you
were
no
longer
a
girl
well
reared
and
disciplined
,
but
<EOS>
a
wild
boy
indulged
from
childhood
upwards
;
imagine
yourself
in
a
remote
foreign
land
;
conceive
that
you
there
commit
a
capital
error
,
<EOS>
no
matter
of
what
nature
or
from
what
motives
,
but
one
whose
consequences
must
follow
you
through
life
and
taint
all
your
existence
.
<EOS>
Mind
,
I
do
n't
say
a
_
crime
_
;
I
am
not
speaking
of
shedding
of
blood
or
any
other
guilty
act
,
which
might
make
the
perpetrator
amenable
to
the
law
:
my
word
is
_
error
_
.
<EOS>
The
results
of
what
you
have
done
become
in
time
to
you
utterly
insupportable
;
you
take
measures
to
obtain
relief
:
unusual
measures
,
but
neither
unlawful
nor
culpable
.
<EOS>
Still
you
are
miserable
;
for
hope
has
quitted
you
on
the
very
confines
of
life
:
your
sun
at
noon
darkens
in
an
eclipse
,
which
you
feel
will
not
leave
it
till
the
time
of
setting
.
<EOS>
Bitter
and
base
associations
have
become
the
sole
food
of
your
memory
:
you
wander
here
and
there
,
seeking
rest
in
exile
:
happiness
in
pleasure
 
<EOS>
I
mean
in
heartless
,
sensual
pleasure
 
such
as
dulls
intellect
and
blights
feeling
.
<EOS>
Heart
-
weary
and
soul
-
withered
<EOS>
,
you
come
home
after
years
of
voluntary
banishment
:
you
make
a
new
acquaintance
 
<EOS>
how
or
where
no
matter
:
you
find
in
this
stranger
much
of
the
good
and
bright
qualities
which
you
have
sought
for
twenty
years
,
and
never
before
encountered
;
and
they
are
all
fresh
,
healthy
,
without
soil
and
without
taint
.
<EOS>
Such
society
revives
,
regenerates
:
you
feel
better
days
come
back
 
higher
wishes
,
purer
feelings
;
you
desire
to
recommence
your
life
,
and
to
spend
what
remains
to
you
of
days
in
a
way
more
worthy
of
an
immortal
being
.
<EOS>
To
attain
this
end
,
are
you
justified
in
overleaping
an
obstacle
of
custom
 
a
mere
conventional
impediment
which
neither
your
conscience
sanctifies
nor
your
judgment
approves
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
for
an
answer
:
and
what
was
I
to
say
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
for
some
good
spirit
to
suggest
a
judicious
and
satisfactory
response
!
<EOS>
Vain
aspiration
!
<EOS>
The
west
wind
whispered
in
the
ivy
round
me
;
but
no
gentle
Ariel
borrowed
its
breath
as
a
medium
of
speech
:
the
birds
sang
in
the
tree
-
tops
;
but
their
song
,
however
sweet
,
was
inarticulate
.
  
<EOS>
Again
Mr.
Rochester
propounded
his
query
:
  
"
<EOS>
Is
the
wandering
and
sinful
,
but
now
rest
-
seeking
and
repentant
,
man
justified
in
daring
the
world
's
opinion
,
in
order
to
attach
to
him
for
ever
this
gentle
,
gracious
,
genial
stranger
,
thereby
securing
his
own
peace
of
mind
and
regeneration
of
life
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
I
answered
,
"
a
wanderer
's
repose
or
a
sinner
's
reformation
should
never
depend
on
a
fellow
-
creature
.
<EOS>
Men
and
women
die
;
philosophers
falter
in
wisdom
,
and
Christians
in
goodness
:
if
any
one
you
know
has
suffered
and
erred
,
let
him
look
higher
than
his
equals
for
strength
to
amend
and
solace
to
heal
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
the
instrument
 
the
instrument
!
<EOS>
God
,
who
does
the
work
,
ordains
the
instrument
.
<EOS>
I
have
myself
 
<EOS>
I
tell
it
you
without
parable
 
been
a
worldly
,
dissipated
,
restless
man
;
and
I
believe
I
have
found
the
instrument
for
my
cure
in
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
:
the
birds
went
on
carolling
,
the
leaves
lightly
rustling
.
<EOS>
I
almost
wondered
they
did
not
check
their
songs
and
whispers
to
catch
the
suspended
revelation
;
but
they
would
have
had
to
wait
many
minutes
 
<EOS>
so
long
was
the
silence
protracted
.
<EOS>
At
last
I
looked
up
at
the
tardy
speaker
:
he
was
looking
eagerly
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Little
friend
,
"
said
he
,
in
quite
a
changed
tone
 
while
his
face
changed
too
,
losing
all
its
softness
and
gravity
,
and
becoming
harsh
and
sarcastic
 
<EOS>
"
you
have
noticed
my
tender
penchant
for
Miss
Ingram
:
do
n't
you
think
if
I
married
her
she
would
regenerate
me
with
a
vengeance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
got
up
instantly
,
went
quite
to
the
other
end
of
the
walk
,
and
when
he
came
back
he
was
humming
a
tune
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
Jane
,
"
said
he
,
stopping
before
me
,
"
you
are
quite
pale
with
your
vigils
:
do
n't
you
curse
me
for
disturbing
your
rest
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Curse
you
?
<EOS>
No
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shake
hands
in
confirmation
of
the
word
.
<EOS>
What
cold
fingers
!
<EOS>
They
were
warmer
last
night
when
I
touched
them
at
the
door
of
the
mysterious
chamber
.
<EOS>
Jane
,
when
will
you
watch
with
me
again
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whenever
I
can
be
useful
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
instance
,
the
night
before
I
am
married
!
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
shall
not
be
able
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
Will
you
promise
to
sit
up
with
me
to
bear
me
company
?
<EOS>
To
you
I
can
talk
of
my
lovely
one
:
for
now
you
have
seen
her
and
know
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
rare
one
,
is
she
not
,
Jane
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
strapper
 
a
real
strapper
,
Jane
:
<EOS>
big
,
brown
,
and
buxom
;
with
hair
just
such
as
the
ladies
of
Carthage
must
have
had
.
<EOS>
Bless
me
!
<EOS>
there
's
Dent
and
Lynn
in
the
stables
!
<EOS>
Go
in
by
the
shrubbery
,
through
that
wicket
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
I
went
one
way
,
he
went
another
,
and
I
heard
him
in
the
yard
,
saying
cheerfully
    
"
Mason
got
the
start
of
you
all
this
morning
<EOS>
;
he
was
gone
before
sunrise
:
I
rose
at
four
to
see
him
off
.
"
    
<EOS>
Presentiments
are
strange
things
!
<EOS>
and
so
are
sympathies
;
and
so
are
signs
;
and
<EOS>
the
three
combined
make
one
mystery
to
which
humanity
has
not
yet
found
the
key
.
<EOS>
I
never
laughed
at
presentiments
in
my
life
,
because
I
have
had
strange
ones
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
Sympathies
,
I
believe
,
exist
(
for
instance
,
between
far
-
distant
,
long
-
absent
,
wholly
estranged
relatives
asserting
,
notwithstanding
their
alienation
,
the
unity
of
the
source
to
which
each
traces
his
origin
)
whose
workings
baffle
mortal
comprehension
.
<EOS>
And
signs
,
for
aught
we
know
,
may
be
<EOS>
but
the
sympathies
of
Nature
with
man
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
was
a
little
girl
,
only
six
years
old
,
I
one
night
heard
Bessie
Leaven
say
to
Martha
Abbot
that
she
had
been
dreaming
about
a
little
child
;
and
that
to
dream
of
children
was
a
sure
sign
of
trouble
,
either
to
one
's
self
or
one
's
kin
.
<EOS>
The
saying
might
have
worn
out
of
my
memory
,
had
not
a
circumstance
immediately
followed
which
served
indelibly
to
fix
it
there
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
Bessie
was
sent
for
home
to
the
deathbed
of
her
little
sister
.
  
<EOS>
Of
late
I
had
often
recalled
this
saying
and
this
incident
;
for
during
the
past
week
scarcely
a
night
had
gone
over
my
couch
that
had
not
brought
with
it
a
dream
of
an
infant
,
which
I
sometimes
hushed
in
my
arms
,
sometimes
dandled
on
my
knee
,
sometimes
watched
playing
with
daisies
on
a
lawn
,
or
again
,
dabbling
its
hands
in
running
water
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
wailing
child
this
night
,
and
a
laughing
one
<EOS>
the
next
:
now
it
nestled
close
to
me
,
and
now
it
ran
from
me
;
but
whatever
mood
the
apparition
evinced
,
whatever
aspect
it
wore
,
it
failed
not
for
seven
successive
nights
to
meet
me
the
moment
I
entered
the
land
of
slumber
.
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
like
this
iteration
of
one
idea
 
this
strange
recurrence
of
one
image
,
and
I
grew
nervous
as
bedtime
approached
and
the
hour
of
the
vision
drew
near
.
<EOS>
It
was
from
companionship
with
this
baby
-
phantom
<EOS>
I
had
been
roused
on
that
moonlight
night
when
I
heard
the
cry
;
and
it
was
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
<EOS>
following
I
was
summoned
downstairs
by
a
message
that
some
one
wanted
me
in
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
room
.
<EOS>
On
repairing
thither
,
I
found
a
man
waiting
for
me
,
having
the
appearance
of
a
gentleman
's
servant
:
he
was
dressed
in
deep
mourning
,
and
the
hat
he
held
in
his
hand
was
surrounded
with
a
crape
band
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
you
hardly
remember
me
,
Miss
,
"
he
said
,
rising
as
I
entered
;
"
but
<EOS>
my
name
is
Leaven
<EOS>
:
I
lived
coachman
with
Mrs.
Reed
when
you
were
at
Gateshead
,
eight
or
nine
years
since
,
and
I
live
there
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Robert
!
<EOS>
how
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
I
remember
you
very
well
:
you
used
to
give
me
a
ride
sometimes
on
Miss
Georgiana
's
bay
pony
.
<EOS>
And
how
is
Bessie
?
<EOS>
You
are
married
to
Bessie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Miss
:
my
wife
is
very
hearty
,
thank
you
;
she
brought
me
another
little
one
about
two
months
<EOS>
since
 
we
have
three
now
 
and
both
mother
and
child
are
thriving
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
are
the
family
well
at
the
house
,
Robert
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
I
ca
n't
give
you
better
news
of
them
,
Miss
<EOS>
:
they
are
very
badly
at
present
 
in
great
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
no
one
is
dead
,
"
I
said
,
glancing
at
his
black
dress
.
<EOS>
He
too
looked
down
at
the
crape
round
his
hat
and
replied
    
"
Mr.
John
died
yesterday
was
a
week
,
at
his
chambers
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
John
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
does
his
mother
bear
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
see
,
Miss
Eyre
,
it
is
not
a
common
mishap
:
<EOS>
his
life
has
been
very
wild
:
these
last
three
years
he
gave
himself
up
to
strange
ways
,
and
his
death
was
shocking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
heard
from
Bessie
<EOS>
he
was
not
doing
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Doing
well
!
<EOS>
He
could
not
do
worse
:
he
ruined
his
health
and
his
estate
amongst
the
worst
men
and
the
worst
women
.
<EOS>
He
got
into
debt
and
into
jail
:
his
mother
helped
him
out
twice
,
but
as
soon
as
he
was
free
he
returned
to
his
old
companions
and
habits
.
<EOS>
His
head
was
not
strong
:
the
knaves
he
lived
amongst
fooled
him
beyond
anything
I
ever
heard
.
<EOS>
He
came
down
to
Gateshead
about
three
weeks
ago
and
wanted
missis
to
give
up
all
to
him
.
<EOS>
Missis
refused
:
her
means
have
long
been
much
reduced
by
his
extravagance
;
so
he
went
back
again
,
and
the
next
news
was
that
he
was
dead
.
<EOS>
How
he
died
,
God
knows
!
 
<EOS>
they
say
he
killed
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
silent
:
the
things
were
frightful
.
<EOS>
Robert
Leaven
resumed
    
"
Missis
had
been
out
of
health
herself
for
some
time
:
she
had
got
very
stout
,
but
was
not
strong
with
it
;
and
the
loss
of
money
and
fear
of
poverty
were
quite
breaking
her
down
.
<EOS>
The
information
about
Mr.
John
's
death
and
the
manner
of
it
came
too
suddenly
:
it
brought
on
a
stroke
.
<EOS>
She
was
three
days
without
speaking
;
but
last
Tuesday
she
seemed
rather
better
<EOS>
:
she
appeared
as
if
she
wanted
to
say
something
,
and
kept
making
signs
to
my
wife
and
mumbling
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
yesterday
morning
,
however
,
that
Bessie
understood
she
was
pronouncing
your
name
;
and
at
last
she
made
out
the
words
,
"
Bring
Jane
 
fetch
<EOS>
Jane
Eyre
<EOS>
:
I
want
to
speak
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
Bessie
is
not
sure
whether
she
is
in
her
right
mind
,
or
means
anything
by
the
words
;
but
she
told
Miss
Reed
and
Miss
Georgiana
,
and
advised
them
to
send
for
you
.
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
put
it
off
at
first
;
but
their
mother
grew
so
restless
,
and
said
,
"
Jane
,
Jane
,
"
so
many
times
,
that
at
last
they
consented
.
<EOS>
I
left
Gateshead
yesterday
:
and
if
you
can
get
ready
,
Miss
,
I
should
like
to
take
you
back
with
me
early
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Robert
,
I
shall
be
ready
:
it
seems
to
me
that
I
ought
to
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
too
,
<EOS>
Miss.
Bessie
said
she
was
sure
you
would
not
refuse
:
but
I
suppose
you
will
have
to
ask
leave
before
you
can
get
off
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
and
I
will
do
it
now
;
"
and
having
directed
him
to
the
servants
'
hall
,
and
recommended
him
to
the
care
of
John
's
wife
,
and
the
attentions
of
John
himself
,
I
went
in
search
of
Mr.
Rochester
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
not
in
any
of
the
lower
rooms
;
he
was
not
in
the
yard
,
the
stables
,
or
the
grounds
.
<EOS>
I
asked
Mrs.
Fairfax
if
she
had
seen
him
;
 
<EOS>
yes
:
she
believed
he
was
playing
billiards
with
Miss
Ingram
.
<EOS>
To
the
billiard-
room
I
hastened
:
the
click
of
balls
and
the
hum
of
voices
resounded
thence
;
Mr.
Rochester
,
Miss
Ingram
,
the
two
Misses
Eshton
,
and
their
admirers
,
were
all
busied
in
the
game
.
<EOS>
It
required
some
courage
to
disturb
so
interesting
a
party
;
my
errand
,
however
,
was
one
I
could
not
defer
,
so
I
approached
the
master
where
he
stood
at
Miss
Ingram
's
side
.
<EOS>
She
turned
as
I
drew
near
,
and
looked
at
me
haughtily
:
<EOS>
her
eyes
seemed
to
demand
,
"
What
can
the
creeping
creature
want
now
?
"
<EOS>
and
when
I
said
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
Mr.
Rochester
,
"
she
made
a
movement
as
if
tempted
to
order
me
away
.
<EOS>
I
remember
her
appearance
at
the
moment
 
<EOS>
it
was
very
graceful
and
very
striking
:
she
wore
a
morning
robe
of
sky
-
blue
crape
;
a
gauzy
azure
scarf
was
twisted
in
her
hair
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
all
animation
with
the
game
,
and
irritated
pride
did
not
lower
the
expression
of
her
haughty
lineaments
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
that
person
want
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
inquired
of
Mr.
Rochester
;
and
Mr.
Rochester
turned
to
see
who
the
"
person
"
was
.
<EOS>
He
made
a
curious
grimace
 
one
of
his
strange
and
equivocal
demonstrations
 
threw
down
his
cue
and
followed
me
from
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Jane
?
"
he
said
,
as
he
rested
his
back
against
the
schoolroom
door
,
which
he
had
shut
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
sir
,
I
want
leave
of
absence
for
a
week
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
where
to
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
see
a
sick
lady
who
has
sent
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
sick
lady
?
 
<EOS>
where
does
she
live
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
At
Gateshead
;
in
shire
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
-shire
?
<EOS>
That
is
a
hundred
miles
off
!
<EOS>
Who
may
she
be
that
sends
for
people
to
see
her
that
distance
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Her
name
is
Reed
,
sir
 
Mrs.
Reed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Reed
of
Gateshead
?
<EOS>
There
was
a
Reed
of
Gateshead
,
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
his
widow
,
sir
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
what
have
you
to
do
with
her
?
<EOS>
How
do
you
know
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Reed
was
my
uncle
 
<EOS>
my
mother
's
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
deuce
he
was
!
<EOS>
You
never
told
me
that
before
:
you
always
said
you
had
no
relations
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
that
would
own
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Reed
is
dead
,
and
his
wife
cast
me
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
was
poor
,
and
burdensome
,
and
she
disliked
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Reed
left
children
?
 
<EOS>
you
must
have
cousins
?
<EOS>
Sir
George
Lynn
was
talking
of
a
Reed
of
Gateshead
yesterday
,
who
,
he
said
,
was
one
of
the
veriest
rascals
on
town
;
and
Ingram
was
mentioning
a
Georgiana
Reed
of
the
same
place
,
who
was
much
admired
for
her
beauty
<EOS>
a
season
or
two
ago
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
John
Reed
is
dead
,
too
,
sir
:
he
ruined
himself
and
half
-
ruined
his
family
,
and
is
supposed
to
have
committed
suicide
.
<EOS>
The
news
so
shocked
his
mother
that
it
brought
on
an
apoplectic
attack
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
good
can
you
do
her
?
<EOS>
Nonsense
,
Jane
!
<EOS>
I
would
never
think
of
running
a
hundred
miles
to
see
an
old
lady
who
will
,
perhaps
,
be
dead
before
you
reach
her
:
<EOS>
besides
,
you
say
she
cast
you
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
but
that
is
long
ago
;
and
when
her
circumstances
were
very
different
:
I
could
not
be
easy
to
neglect
her
wishes
now
.
"
  
"
How
long
will
you
stay
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
short
a
time
as
possible
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Promise
me
only
to
stay
a
week
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
had
better
not
pass
my
word
:
I
might
be
obliged
to
break
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
you
_
will
_
come
back
:
you
will
not
be
induced
under
any
pretext
to
take
up
a
permanent
residence
with
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
I
shall
certainly
return
if
all
be
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
who
goes
with
you
?
<EOS>
You
do
n't
travel
a
hundred
miles
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
she
has
sent
her
coachman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
person
to
be
trusted
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
he
has
lived
ten
years
in
the
family
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
meditated
.
<EOS>
"
When
do
you
wish
to
go
?
"
  
"
Early
to
-
morrow
morning
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
must
have
some
money
;
you
ca
n't
travel
without
money
,
and
I
daresay
you
have
not
much
<EOS>
:
I
have
given
you
no
salary
yet
.
<EOS>
How
much
have
you
in
the
world
,
Jane
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
I
drew
out
my
purse
;
a
meagre
thing
it
was
.
"
<EOS>
Five
shillings
,
sir
.
"
<EOS>
He
took
the
purse
,
poured
the
hoard
into
his
palm
,
and
chuckled
over
it
as
if
its
scantiness
amused
him
.
<EOS>
Soon
he
produced
his
pocket
-
book
:
"
<EOS>
Here
,
"
said
he
,
offering
me
a
note
;
it
was
fifty
pounds
,
and
he
owed
me
but
fifteen
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
had
no
change
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
change
;
you
know
that
.
<EOS>
Take
your
wages
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
declined
accepting
more
than
was
my
due
.
<EOS>
He
scowled
at
first
;
then
,
as
if
recollecting
something
,
he
said
    
"
Right
,
right
!
<EOS>
Better
not
give
you
all
now
:
you
would
,
perhaps
,
stay
away
three
months
if
you
had
fifty
pounds
.
<EOS>
There
are
ten
;
is
it
not
plenty
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
but
now
you
owe
me
five
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
back
for
it
,
then
;
I
am
your
banker
for
forty
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Rochester
,
I
may
as
well
mention
another
matter
of
business
to
you
while
I
have
the
opportunity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Matter
of
business
?
<EOS>
I
am
curious
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
as
good
as
informed
me
,
sir
,
that
you
are
going
shortly
to
be
married
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
what
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
,
sir
,
Adele
ought
to
go
to
school
:
I
am
sure
you
will
perceive
the
necessity
of
it
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
get
her
out
of
my
bride
's
way
,
who
might
otherwise
walk
over
her
rather
too
emphatically
?
<EOS>
There
's
sense
in
the
suggestion
;
not
a
doubt
of
it
.
<EOS>
Adele
,
as
you
say
,
must
go
to
school
;
and
you
,
of
course
,
must
march
straight
to
 
the
devil
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
sir
;
but
I
must
seek
another
situation
somewhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
course
!
"
he
exclaimed
,
with
a
twang
of
voice
and
a
distortion
of
features
equally
fantastic
and
ludicrous
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
some
minutes
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
old
Madam
Reed
,
or
the
Misses
,
her
daughters
,
will
be
solicited
by
you
to
seek
a
place
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
sir
;
I
am
not
on
such
terms
with
my
relatives
as
would
justify
me
in
asking
favours
of
them
 
<EOS>
but
I
shall
advertise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
walk
up
the
pyramids
of
Egypt
!
"
<EOS>
he
growled
.
<EOS>
"
At
your
peril
you
advertise
!
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
only
offered
you
a
sovereign
instead
of
ten
pounds
.
<EOS>
Give
me
back
nine
pounds
,
Jane
;
I
've
a
use
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
so
have
I
,
sir
,
"
I
returned
,
putting
my
hands
and
my
purse
behind
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
spare
the
money
on
any
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Little
niggard
!
"
said
he
,
"
refusing
me
a
pecuniary
request
!
<EOS>
Give
me
five
pounds
,
Jane
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
five
shillings
,
sir
;
nor
five
pence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
let
me
look
at
the
cash
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
;
you
are
not
to
be
trusted
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Jane
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Promise
me
one
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
promise
you
anything
,
sir
,
that
I
think
I
am
likely
to
perform
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
to
advertise
:
and
to
trust
this
quest
of
a
situation
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
'll
find
you
one
in
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad
so
to
do
,
sir
,
if
you
,
in
your
turn
,
will
promise
that
I
and
Adele
shall
be
both
safe
out
of
the
house
before
your
bride
enters
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Very
well
!
<EOS>
very
well
!
<EOS>
I
'll
pledge
my
word
on
it
.
<EOS>
You
go
to
-
morrow
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
;
early
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
come
down
to
the
drawing
-
room
after
dinner
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
I
must
prepare
for
the
journey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
and
I
must
bid
good
-
bye
for
a
little
while
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
do
people
perform
that
ceremony
of
parting
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
Teach
me
;
I
'm
not
quite
up
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
say
,
Farewell
,
or
any
other
form
they
prefer
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
say
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
Mr.
Rochester
,
for
the
present
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
must
I
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
same
,
if
you
like
,
sir
.
"
  
"
Farewell
,
Miss
Eyre
,
for
the
present
;
is
that
all
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
stingy
,
to
my
notions
,
and
dry
,
and
unfriendly
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
something
else
:
a
little
addition
to
the
rite
.
<EOS>
If
one
shook
hands
,
for
instance
;
but
no
 
that
would
not
content
me
either
.
<EOS>
So
you
'll
do
no
more
than
say
Farewell
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
enough
,
sir
:
as
much
good
-
will
may
be
conveyed
in
one
hearty
word
as
in
many
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Very
likely
;
but
it
is
blank
and
cool
 
"
Farewell
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
How
long
is
he
going
to
stand
with
his
back
against
that
door
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
myself
;
"
I
want
to
commence
my
packing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
dinner
-
bell
rang
,
and
suddenly
away
he
bolted
,
without
another
syllable
<EOS>
:
I
saw
him
no
more
during
the
day
,
and
was
off
before
he
had
risen
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
reached
the
lodge
at
Gateshead
about
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
of
the
first
of
May
:
I
stepped
in
there
before
going
up
to
the
hall
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
clean
and
neat
:
the
ornamental
windows
were
hung
with
little
white
curtains
;
the
floor
was
spotless
;
the
grate
and
fire
-
irons
were
burnished
bright
,
and
the
fire
burnt
clear
.
<EOS>
Bessie
sat
on
the
hearth
,
nursing
her
last
-
born
,
and
Robert
and
his
sister
played
quietly
in
a
corner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
knew
you
would
come
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mrs.
Leaven
,
as
I
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Bessie
,
"
said
I
,
after
I
had
kissed
her
;
"
and
I
trust
I
am
not
too
late
.
<EOS>
How
is
Mrs.
Reed
?
 
<EOS>
Alive
<EOS>
still
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
she
is
alive
;
and
more
sensible
and
collected
than
she
was
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
says
she
may
linger
a
week
or
two
yet
;
but
he
hardly
thinks
she
will
finally
recover
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
she
mentioned
me
lately
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
talking
of
you
only
this
morning
,
and
wishing
you
would
come
,
but
she
is
sleeping
now
,
or
was
ten
minutes
ago
,
when
I
was
up
at
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
generally
lies
in
a
kind
of
lethargy
all
the
afternoon
,
and
wakes
up
about
six
or
seven
.
<EOS>
Will
you
rest
yourself
here
an
hour
,
Miss
,
and
then
I
will
go
up
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Robert
here
entered
,
and
Bessie
laid
her
sleeping
child
in
the
cradle
and
went
to
welcome
him
:
<EOS>
afterwards
she
insisted
on
my
taking
off
my
bonnet
and
having
some
tea
;
for
she
said
I
looked
pale
and
tired
.
<EOS>
I
was
glad
to
accept
her
hospitality
;
and
I
submitted
to
be
relieved
of
my
travelling
garb
just
as
passively
as
I
used
to
let
her
undress
me
when
a
child
.
  
<EOS>
Old
times
crowded
fast
back
on
me
as
I
watched
her
bustling
about
 
setting
out
the
tea
-
tray
with
her
best
china
,
cutting
bread
and
butter
,
toasting
a
tea
-
cake
,
and
,
between
whiles
,
giving
little
Robert
or
Jane
an
occasional
tap
or
push
,
just
as
she
used
to
give
me
in
former
days
.
<EOS>
Bessie
had
retained
her
quick
temper
as
well
as
her
light
foot
and
good
looks
.
  
<EOS>
Tea
ready
,
I
was
going
to
approach
the
table
;
but
she
desired
me
to
sit
still
,
quite
in
her
old
peremptory
tones
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
served
at
the
fireside
,
she
said
;
and
she
placed
before
me
a
little
round
stand
with
my
cup
and
a
plate
of
toast
,
absolutely
as
she
used
to
accommodate
me
with
some
privately
purloined
dainty
on
a
nursery
chair
:
and
I
smiled
and
obeyed
her
as
in
bygone
days
.
  
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
know
if
I
was
happy
at
Thornfield
Hall
,
and
what
sort
of
a
person
the
mistress
was
;
and
when
I
told
her
there
was
only
a
master
,
whether
he
was
a
nice
gentleman
,
and
if
I
liked
him
.
<EOS>
I
told
her
he
was
rather
an
ugly
man
,
but
quite
a
gentleman
;
and
that
he
treated
me
kindly
,
and
I
was
content
.
<EOS>
Then
I
went
on
to
describe
to
her
the
gay
company
that
had
lately
been
staying
at
the
house
;
and
to
these
details
Bessie
listened
with
interest
:
they
were
precisely
of
the
kind
she
relished
.
  
<EOS>
In
such
conversation
an
hour
was
soon
gone
:
Bessie
restored
to
me
my
bonnet
,
&
c.
,
and
,
accompanied
by
her
,
<EOS>
I
quitted
the
lodge
for
the
hall
.
<EOS>
It
was
also
accompanied
by
her
that
I
had
,
nearly
nine
years
ago
,
walked
down
the
path
I
was
now
ascending
.
<EOS>
On
a
dark
,
misty
,
raw
morning
in
January
,
I
had
left
a
hostile
roof
with
a
desperate
and
embittered
heart
 
a
sense
of
outlawry
and
almost
of
reprobation
 
to
seek
the
chilly
harbourage
of
Lowood
:
that
bourne
so
far
away
and
unexplored
.
<EOS>
The
same
hostile
roof
now
again
rose
before
me
:
<EOS>
my
prospects
were
doubtful
yet
;
and
I
had
yet
an
aching
heart
.
<EOS>
I
still
felt
as
a
wanderer
on
the
face
of
the
earth
;
but
I
experienced
firmer
trust
in
myself
and
my
own
powers
,
and
less
withering
dread
of
oppression
.
<EOS>
The
gaping
wound
of
my
wrongs
,
too
,
was
now
quite
healed
;
and
the
flame
of
resentment
extinguished
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
go
into
the
breakfast
-
room
first
,
"
said
Bessie
,
as
she
preceded
me
through
the
hall
;
"
the
young
ladies
will
be
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
another
moment
I
was
within
that
apartment
.
<EOS>
There
was
every
article
of
furniture
looking
just
as
it
did
on
the
morning
I
was
first
introduced
to
Mr.
Brocklehurst
:
the
very
rug
he
had
stood
upon
still
covered
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
Glancing
at
the
bookcases
,
I
thought
I
could
distinguish
the
two
volumes
of
Bewick
's
British
Birds
occupying
their
old
place
on
the
third
shelf
,
and
Gulliver
's
Travels
and
the
Arabian
Nights
ranged
just
above
.
<EOS>
The
inanimate
objects
were
not
changed
;
but
the
living
things
had
altered
past
recognition
.
  
<EOS>
Two
young
ladies
appeared
before
me
;
one
very
tall
,
almost
as
tall
as
Miss
Ingram
 
very
thin
too
,
with
a
sallow
face
and
severe
mien
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
ascetic
in
her
look
,
which
was
augmented
by
the
extreme
plainness
of
a
straight
-
skirted
,
black
,
stuff
dress
,
a
starched
linen
collar
,
hair
combed
away
from
the
temples
,
and
the
nun
-
like
ornament
of
a
string
of
ebony
beads
and
a
crucifix
.
<EOS>
This
<EOS>
I
felt
sure
<EOS>
was
Eliza
,
though
I
could
trace
little
resemblance
to
her
former
self
in
that
elongated
and
colourless
visage
.
  
<EOS>
The
other
was
as
certainly
Georgiana
:
but
not
the
Georgiana
<EOS>
I
remembered
 
the
slim
and
fairy
-
like
girl
of
eleven
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
full
-
blown
,
very
plump
damsel
,
fair
as
waxwork
,
with
handsome
and
regular
features
,
languishing
blue
eyes
,
and
ringleted
yellow
hair
.
<EOS>
The
hue
of
her
dress
was
black
too
;
but
its
fashion
was
so
different
from
her
sister
's
 
so
much
more
flowing
and
becoming
 
<EOS>
it
looked
as
stylish
as
the
other
's
looked
puritanical
.
  
<EOS>
In
each
of
the
sisters
there
was
one
trait
of
the
mother
 
and
only
one
;
the
thin
and
pallid
elder
daughter
had
her
parent
's
Cairngorm
eye
:
the
blooming
and
luxuriant
younger
girl
had
her
contour
of
jaw
and
chin
 
perhaps
a
little
softened
,
but
still
imparting
an
indescribable
hardness
to
the
countenance
otherwise
so
voluptuous
and
buxom
.
  
<EOS>
Both
ladies
,
as
I
advanced
,
rose
to
welcome
me
,
and
both
addressed
me
by
the
name
of
"
Miss
Eyre
.
<EOS>
"
Eliza
's
greeting
was
delivered
in
a
short
,
abrupt
voice
,
without
a
smile
;
and
then
she
sat
down
again
,
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
fire
,
and
seemed
to
forget
me
.
<EOS>
Georgiana
added
to
her
"
How
d'ye
do
?
"
<EOS>
several
commonplaces
about
my
journey
,
the
weather
,
and
so
on
,
uttered
in
rather
a
drawling
tone
:
and
accompanied
by
sundry
side
-
glances
that
measured
me
from
head
to
foot
 
now
traversing
the
folds
of
my
drab
merino
pelisse
,
and
now
lingering
on
the
plain
trimming
of
my
cottage
bonnet
.
<EOS>
Young
ladies
have
a
remarkable
way
of
letting
you
know
that
they
think
you
a
"
quiz
"
without
actually
saying
the
words
.
<EOS>
A
certain
superciliousness
of
look
,
coolness
of
manner
,
nonchalance
of
tone
,
express
fully
their
sentiments
on
the
point
,
without
committing
them
by
any
positive
rudeness
in
word
or
deed
.
  
<EOS>
A
sneer
,
however
,
whether
covert
or
open
,
had
now
no
longer
that
power
over
me
it
once
possessed
:
as
I
sat
between
my
cousins
,
I
was
surprised
to
find
how
easy
I
felt
under
the
total
neglect
of
the
one
and
the
semi-
sarcastic
attentions
of
the
other
 
Eliza
did
not
mortify
,
nor
Georgiana
ruffle
me
.
<EOS>
The
fact
was
,
I
had
other
things
to
think
about
;
within
the
last
few
months
feelings
had
been
stirred
in
me
so
much
more
potent
than
any
they
could
raise
 
pains
and
pleasures
so
much
more
acute
and
exquisite
had
been
excited
than
any
it
was
in
their
power
to
inflict
or
bestow
 
that
their
airs
gave
me
no
concern
either
for
good
or
bad
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
Mrs.
Reed
?
"
<EOS>
I
asked
soon
,
looking
calmly
at
Georgiana
,
who
thought
fit
to
bridle
at
the
direct
address
,
as
if
it
were
an
unexpected
liberty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Reed
?
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
mama
,
you
mean
;
she
is
extremely
poorly
:
I
doubt
if
you
can
see
her
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
,
"
said
I
,
"
you
would
just
step
upstairs
and
tell
her
I
am
come
,
I
should
be
much
obliged
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Georgiana
almost
started
,
and
she
opened
her
blue
eyes
wild
and
wide
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
she
had
a
particular
wish
to
see
me
,
"
I
added
,
"
and
I
would
not
defer
attending
to
her
desire
longer
than
is
absolutely
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mama
dislikes
being
disturbed
in
an
evening
,
"
remarked
Eliza
.
<EOS>
I
soon
rose
,
quietly
took
off
my
bonnet
and
gloves
,
uninvited
,
and
said
I
would
just
step
out
to
Bessie
 
<EOS>
who
was
,
I
dared
say
,
in
the
kitchen
 
and
ask
her
to
ascertain
whether
Mrs.
Reed
was
disposed
to
receive
me
or
not
to-
night
.
<EOS>
I
went
,
and
having
found
Bessie
and
despatched
her
on
my
errand
,
I
proceeded
to
take
further
measures
.
<EOS>
It
had
heretofore
been
my
habit
always
to
shrink
from
arrogance
:
received
as
I
had
been
to
-
day
<EOS>
,
I
should
,
a
year
ago
,
have
resolved
to
quit
Gateshead
the
very
next
morning
;
now
,
it
was
disclosed
to
me
all
at
once
that
that
would
be
a
foolish
plan
.
<EOS>
I
had
taken
a
journey
of
a
hundred
miles
to
see
my
aunt
,
and
I
must
stay
with
her
till
she
was
better
 
or
dead
<EOS>
:
as
to
her
daughters
'
pride
or
folly
,
I
must
put
it
on
one
side
,
make
myself
independent
of
it
.
<EOS>
So
I
addressed
the
housekeeper
;
asked
her
to
show
me
a
room
,
told
her
I
should
probably
be
a
visitor
here
for
a
week
or
two
,
had
my
trunk
conveyed
to
my
chamber
,
and
followed
it
thither
myself
:
I
met
Bessie
on
the
landing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Missis
is
awake
,
"
said
she
;
"
I
have
told
her
you
are
here
:
come
and
let
us
see
if
she
will
know
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
need
to
be
guided
to
the
well
-
known
room
,
to
which
I
had
so
often
been
summoned
for
chastisement
or
reprimand
in
former
days
.
<EOS>
I
hastened
before
Bessie
;
I
softly
opened
the
door
:
a
shaded
light
stood
on
the
table
,
for
it
was
now
getting
dark
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
great
four
-
post
bed
with
amber
hangings
as
of
old
;
there
the
toilet
-
table
,
the
armchair
,
and
the
footstool
,
at
which
I
had
a
hundred
times
been
sentenced
to
kneel
,
to
ask
pardon
for
offences
by
me
uncommitted
.
<EOS>
I
looked
into
a
certain
corner
near
,
half
-
expecting
to
see
the
slim
outline
of
a
once
dreaded
switch
which
used
to
lurk
there
,
waiting
to
leap
out
imp
-
like
and
lace
my
quivering
palm
or
shrinking
neck
.
<EOS>
I
approached
the
bed
;
I
opened
the
curtains
and
leant
over
the
high
-
piled
pillows
.
  
<EOS>
Well
did
I
remember
Mrs.
Reed
's
face
,
and
I
eagerly
sought
the
familiar
image
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
happy
thing
that
time
quells
the
longings
of
vengeance
and
hushes
the
promptings
of
rage
and
aversion
.
<EOS>
I
had
left
this
woman
in
bitterness
and
hate
,
and
I
came
back
to
her
now
with
no
other
emotion
than
a
sort
of
ruth
for
her
great
sufferings
,
and
a
strong
yearning
to
forget
and
forgive
all
injuries
 
to
be
reconciled
and
clasp
hands
in
amity
.
  
<EOS>
The
well
-
known
face
was
there
:
stern
,
relentless
as
ever
 
<EOS>
there
was
that
peculiar
eye
which
nothing
could
melt
,
and
the
somewhat
raised
,
imperious
,
despotic
eyebrow
.
<EOS>
How
often
had
it
lowered
on
me
menace
and
hate
!
<EOS>
and
how
the
recollection
of
childhood
's
terrors
and
sorrows
revived
as
I
traced
its
harsh
line
now
!
<EOS>
And
yet
I
stooped
down
and
kissed
her
:
she
looked
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
this
Jane
Eyre
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Aunt
Reed
.
<EOS>
How
are
you
,
dear
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
once
vowed
that
I
would
never
call
her
aunt
again
:
I
thought
it
no
sin
to
forget
and
break
that
vow
now
.
<EOS>
My
fingers
had
fastened
on
her
hand
which
lay
outside
the
sheet
:
had
she
pressed
mine
kindly
,
I
should
at
that
moment
have
experienced
true
pleasure
.
<EOS>
But
unimpressionable
natures
are
not
so
soon
softened
,
nor
are
natural
antipathies
so
readily
eradicated
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
took
her
hand
away
,
and
,
turning
her
face
rather
from
me
<EOS>
,
she
remarked
that
the
night
was
warm
.
<EOS>
Again
she
regarded
me
so
icily
<EOS>
,
I
felt
at
once
that
her
opinion
of
me
 
her
feeling
towards
me
 
was
unchanged
and
unchangeable
.
<EOS>
I
knew
by
her
stony
eye
 
opaque
to
tenderness
,
indissoluble
to
tears
 
that
she
was
resolved
to
consider
me
bad
to
the
last
;
because
to
believe
me
good
would
give
her
no
generous
pleasure
:
only
a
sense
of
mortification
.
  
<EOS>
I
felt
pain
,
and
then
I
felt
ire
;
and
then
I
felt
a
determination
to
subdue
her
 
to
be
her
mistress
in
spite
both
of
her
nature
and
her
will
.
<EOS>
My
tears
had
risen
,
just
as
in
childhood
:
I
ordered
them
back
to
their
source
.
<EOS>
I
brought
a
chair
to
the
bed
-
head
:
I
sat
down
and
leaned
over
the
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
sent
for
me
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
I
am
here
;
and
it
is
my
intention
to
stay
till
I
see
how
you
get
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
of
course
!
<EOS>
You
have
seen
my
daughters
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
may
tell
them
I
wish
you
to
stay
till
I
can
talk
some
things
over
with
you
<EOS>
I
have
on
my
mind
:
to
-
night
<EOS>
it
is
too
late
,
and
I
have
a
difficulty
in
recalling
them
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
something
I
wished
to
say
 
let
me
see
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
wandering
look
and
changed
utterance
told
what
wreck
had
taken
place
in
her
once
vigorous
frame
.
<EOS>
Turning
restlessly
,
she
drew
the
bedclothes
round
her
;
my
elbow
,
resting
on
a
corner
of
the
quilt
,
fixed
it
down
:
she
was
at
once
irritated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
up
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
;
"
do
n't
annoy
me
with
holding
the
clothes
fast
.
<EOS>
Are
you
Jane
Eyre
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
Jane
Eyre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
more
trouble
with
that
child
than
any
one
would
believe
.
<EOS>
Such
a
burden
to
be
left
on
my
hands
 
and
so
much
annoyance
as
she
caused
me
,
daily
and
hourly
,
with
her
incomprehensible
disposition
,
and
her
sudden
starts
of
temper
,
and
her
continual
,
unnatural
watchings
of
one
's
movements
!
<EOS>
I
declare
she
talked
to
me
once
like
something
mad
,
or
like
a
fiend
 
no
child
ever
spoke
or
looked
as
she
did
;
I
was
glad
to
get
her
away
from
the
house
.
<EOS>
What
did
they
do
with
her
at
Lowood
?
<EOS>
The
fever
broke
out
there
,
and
many
of
the
pupils
died
.
<EOS>
She
,
however
,
did
not
die
:
<EOS>
but
I
said
she
did
 
<EOS>
I
wish
she
had
died
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
strange
wish
,
Mrs.
Reed
;
why
do
you
hate
her
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
a
dislike
to
her
mother
always
;
for
she
was
my
husband
's
only
sister
,
and
a
great
favourite
with
him
:
he
opposed
the
family
's
disowning
her
when
she
made
her
low
marriage
;
and
when
news
came
of
her
death
,
he
wept
like
a
simpleton
.
<EOS>
He
would
send
for
the
baby
;
though
I
entreated
him
rather
to
put
it
out
to
nurse
and
pay
for
its
maintenance
.
<EOS>
I
hated
it
the
first
time
I
set
my
eyes
on
it
 
a
sickly
,
whining
,
pining
thing
!
<EOS>
It
would
wail
in
its
cradle
all
night
long
 
not
screaming
heartily
like
any
other
child
,
but
whimpering
and
moaning
.
<EOS>
Reed
pitied
it
;
and
he
used
to
nurse
it
and
notice
it
as
if
it
had
been
his
own
:
more
,
indeed
,
than
he
ever
noticed
his
own
at
that
age
.
<EOS>
He
would
try
to
make
my
children
friendly
to
the
little
beggar
:
the
darlings
could
not
bear
it
,
and
he
was
angry
with
them
when
they
showed
their
dislike
.
<EOS>
In
his
last
illness
,
he
had
it
brought
continually
to
his
bedside
;
and
but
an
hour
before
he
died
,
he
bound
me
by
vow
to
keep
the
creature
.
<EOS>
I
would
as
soon
have
been
charged
with
a
pauper
brat
out
of
a
workhouse
:
but
he
was
weak
,
naturally
weak
.
<EOS>
John
does
not
at
all
resemble
his
father
,
and
I
am
glad
of
it
<EOS>
:
John
is
like
me
and
like
my
brothers
 
he
is
quite
a
Gibson
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
wish
he
would
cease
tormenting
me
with
letters
for
money
?
<EOS>
I
have
no
more
money
to
give
him
:
we
are
getting
poor
.
<EOS>
I
must
send
away
half
the
servants
and
shut
up
part
of
the
house
;
or
let
it
off
.
<EOS>
I
can
never
submit
to
do
that
 
yet
<EOS>
how
are
we
to
get
on
?
<EOS>
Two
-
thirds
of
my
income
goes
in
paying
the
interest
of
mortgages
.
<EOS>
John
gambles
dreadfully
,
and
always
loses
 
poor
boy
!
<EOS>
He
is
beset
by
sharpers
:
John
is
sunk
and
degraded
 
his
look
is
frightful
 
<EOS>
I
feel
ashamed
for
him
when
I
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
getting
much
excited
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
had
better
leave
her
now
,
"
said
I
to
Bessie
,
who
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
had
,
Miss
:
<EOS>
but
she
often
talks
in
this
way
towards
night
 
in
the
morning
<EOS>
she
is
calmer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
rose
.
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Reed
,
"
there
is
another
thing
I
wished
to
say
.
<EOS>
He
threatens
me
 
he
continually
threatens
me
with
his
own
death
,
or
mine
:
and
I
dream
sometimes
that
I
see
him
laid
out
with
a
great
wound
in
his
throat
,
or
with
a
swollen
and
blackened
face
.
<EOS>
I
am
come
to
a
strange
pass
:
I
have
heavy
troubles
.
<EOS>
What
is
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
How
is
the
money
to
be
had
?
"
  
<EOS>
Bessie
now
endeavoured
to
persuade
her
to
take
a
sedative
draught
:
she
succeeded
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
,
Mrs.
Reed
grew
more
composed
,
and
sank
into
a
dozing
state
.
<EOS>
I
then
left
her
.
  
<EOS>
More
than
ten
days
elapsed
before
I
had
again
any
conversation
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
continued
either
delirious
or
lethargic
;
and
the
doctor
forbade
everything
which
could
painfully
excite
her
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
I
got
on
as
well
as
I
could
with
Georgiana
and
Eliza
.
<EOS>
They
were
very
cold
,
indeed
,
at
first
.
<EOS>
Eliza
would
sit
half
the
day
sewing
,
reading
,
or
writing
,
and
scarcely
utter
a
word
either
to
me
or
her
sister
.
<EOS>
Georgiana
would
chatter
nonsense
to
her
canary
bird
by
the
hour
,
and
take
no
notice
of
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
determined
not
to
seem
at
a
loss
for
occupation
or
amusement
:
I
had
brought
my
drawing
materials
with
me
,
and
they
served
me
for
both
.
  
<EOS>
Provided
with
a
case
of
pencils
,
and
some
sheets
of
paper
,
I
used
to
take
a
seat
apart
from
them
,
near
the
window
,
and
busy
myself
in
sketching
fancy
vignettes
,
representing
any
scene
that
happened
momentarily
to
shape
itself
in
the
ever
-
shifting
kaleidoscope
of
imagination
:
a
glimpse
of
sea
between
two
rocks
;
the
rising
moon
,
and
a
ship
crossing
its
disk
;
a
group
of
reeds
and
water
-
flags
,
and
a
naiad
's
head
,
crowned
with
lotus-
flowers
,
rising
out
of
them
;
an
elf
sitting
in
a
hedge
-
sparrow
's
nest
,
under
a
wreath
of
hawthorn
-
bloom
.
  
<EOS>
One
morning
I
fell
to
sketching
a
face
:
<EOS>
what
sort
of
a
face
it
was
to
be
,
I
did
not
care
or
know
.
<EOS>
I
took
a
soft
black
pencil
,
gave
it
a
broad
point
,
and
worked
away
.
<EOS>
Soon
I
had
traced
on
the
paper
a
broad
and
prominent
forehead
and
a
square
lower
outline
of
visage
:
<EOS>
that
contour
gave
me
pleasure
;
my
fingers
proceeded
actively
to
fill
it
with
features
.
<EOS>
Strongly
-
marked
horizontal
eyebrows
must
be
traced
under
that
brow
;
then
followed
,
naturally
,
a
well
-
defined
nose
,
with
a
straight
ridge
and
full
nostrils
;
then
a
flexible
-
looking
mouth
,
by
no
means
narrow
;
then
a
firm
chin
,
with
a
decided
cleft
down
the
middle
of
it
:
of
course
,
some
black
whiskers
were
wanted
,
and
some
jetty
hair
,
tufted
on
the
temples
,
and
waved
above
the
forehead
.
<EOS>
Now
for
the
eyes
:
I
had
left
them
to
the
last
,
because
they
required
the
most
careful
working
.
<EOS>
I
drew
them
large
;
I
shaped
them
well
:
<EOS>
the
eyelashes
I
traced
long
and
sombre
;
the
irids
lustrous
and
large
.
"
<EOS>
Good
!
<EOS>
but
not
quite
the
thing
<EOS>
,
"
I
thought
,
as
I
surveyed
the
effect
:
"
they
want
more
force
and
spirit
;
"
and
I
wrought
the
shades
blacker
,
that
the
lights
might
flash
more
brilliantly
 
<EOS>
a
happy
touch
or
two
secured
success
.
<EOS>
There
,
I
had
a
friend
's
face
under
my
gaze
;
and
what
did
it
signify
that
those
young
ladies
turned
their
backs
on
me
?
<EOS>
I
looked
at
it
;
I
smiled
at
the
speaking
likeness
:
I
was
absorbed
and
content
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
a
portrait
of
some
one
you
know
?
"
asked
Eliza
,
who
had
approached
me
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
I
responded
that
it
was
merely
a
fancy
head
,
and
hurried
it
beneath
the
other
sheets
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
lied
:
<EOS>
it
was
,
in
fact
,
a
very
faithful
representation
of
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
But
what
was
that
to
her
,
or
to
any
one
but
myself
?
<EOS>
Georgiana
also
advanced
to
look
.
<EOS>
The
other
drawings
pleased
her
much
,
but
she
called
that
"
an
ugly
man
.
<EOS>
"
They
both
seemed
surprised
at
my
skill
.
<EOS>
I
offered
to
sketch
their
portraits
;
and
each
,
in
turn
,
sat
for
a
pencil
outline
.
<EOS>
Then
Georgiana
produced
her
album
.
<EOS>
I
promised
to
contribute
a
water
-
colour
drawing
:
this
put
her
at
once
into
good
humour
.
<EOS>
She
proposed
a
walk
in
the
grounds
.
<EOS>
Before
we
had
been
out
two
hours
,
we
were
deep
in
a
confidential
conversation
:
she
had
favoured
me
with
a
description
of
the
brilliant
winter
she
had
spent
in
London
two
seasons
ago
 
of
the
admiration
she
had
there
excited
 
the
attention
she
had
received
;
and
I
even
got
hints
of
the
titled
conquest
she
had
made
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
afternoon
and
evening
these
hints
were
enlarged
on
:
various
soft
conversations
were
reported
,
and
sentimental
scenes
represented
;
and
,
in
short
,
a
volume
of
a
novel
of
fashionable
life
was
that
day
improvised
by
her
for
my
benefit
.
<EOS>
The
communications
were
renewed
from
day
to
day
:
they
always
ran
on
the
same
theme
 
herself
,
her
loves
,
and
woes
.
<EOS>
It
was
strange
she
never
once
adverted
either
to
her
mother
's
illness
,
or
her
brother
's
death
,
or
the
present
gloomy
state
of
the
family
prospects
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
seemed
wholly
taken
up
with
reminiscences
of
past
gaiety
,
and
aspirations
after
dissipations
to
come
.
<EOS>
She
passed
about
five
minutes
each
day
in
her
mother
's
sick
-
room
,
and
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Eliza
still
spoke
little
:
she
had
evidently
no
time
to
talk
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
a
busier
person
than
she
seemed
to
be
;
yet
it
was
difficult
to
say
what
she
did
:
or
rather
,
to
discover
any
result
of
her
diligence
.
<EOS>
She
had
an
alarm
to
call
her
up
early
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
she
occupied
herself
before
breakfast
,
but
after
that
meal
she
divided
her
time
into
regular
portions
,
and
each
hour
had
its
allotted
task
.
<EOS>
Three
times
a
day
she
studied
a
little
book
,
which
I
found
,
on
inspection
,
<EOS>
was
a
Common
Prayer
Book
.
<EOS>
I
asked
her
once
what
was
the
great
attraction
of
that
volume
,
and
she
said
,
"
the
Rubric
.
<EOS>
"
Three
hours
she
gave
to
stitching
,
with
gold
thread
,
the
border
of
a
square
crimson
cloth
,
almost
large
enough
for
a
carpet
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
my
inquiries
after
the
use
of
this
article
,
she
informed
me
it
was
a
covering
for
the
altar
of
a
new
church
lately
erected
near
Gateshead
.
<EOS>
Two
hours
she
devoted
to
her
diary
;
two
to
working
by
herself
in
the
kitchen
-
garden
;
and
one
to
the
regulation
of
her
accounts
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
want
no
company
;
no
conversation
.
<EOS>
I
believe
she
was
happy
in
her
way
:
this
routine
sufficed
for
her
;
and
nothing
annoyed
her
so
much
as
the
occurrence
of
any
incident
which
forced
her
to
vary
its
clockwork
regularity
.
  
<EOS>
She
told
me
one
evening
,
when
more
disposed
to
be
communicative
than
usual
,
that
John
's
conduct
,
and
the
threatened
ruin
of
the
family
,
had
been
a
source
of
profound
affliction
to
her
:
but
<EOS>
she
had
now
,
she
said
,
settled
her
mind
,
and
formed
her
resolution
.
<EOS>
Her
own
fortune
she
had
taken
care
to
secure
;
and
when
her
mother
died
 
and
it
was
wholly
improbable
,
she
tranquilly
remarked
,
that
she
should
either
recover
or
linger
long
 
<EOS>
she
would
execute
a
long
-
cherished
project
:
seek
a
retirement
where
punctual
habits
would
be
permanently
secured
from
disturbance
,
and
place
safe
barriers
between
herself
and
a
frivolous
world
.
<EOS>
I
asked
if
Georgiana
would
accompany
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
.
<EOS>
Georgiana
and
<EOS>
she
had
nothing
in
common
:
they
never
had
had
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
be
burdened
with
her
society
for
any
consideration
.
<EOS>
Georgiana
should
take
her
own
course
;
and
she
,
Eliza
,
would
take
hers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Georgiana
,
when
not
unburdening
her
heart
to
me
,
spent
most
of
her
time
in
lying
on
the
sofa
,
fretting
about
the
dulness
of
the
house
,
and
wishing
over
and
over
again
that
her
aunt
Gibson
would
send
her
an
invitation
up
to
town
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
so
much
better
,
"
she
said
,
"
if
she
could
only
get
out
of
the
way
for
a
month
or
two
,
till
all
was
over
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
ask
what
she
meant
by
"
all
being
over
,
"
but
I
suppose
she
referred
to
the
expected
decease
of
her
mother
and
the
gloomy
sequel
of
funeral
rites
.
<EOS>
Eliza
generally
took
no
more
notice
of
her
sister
's
indolence
and
complaints
than
if
no
such
murmuring
,
lounging
object
had
been
before
her
.
<EOS>
One
day
,
however
,
as
she
put
away
her
account
-
book
and
unfolded
her
embroidery
,
she
suddenly
took
her
up
thus
    
<EOS>
"
Georgiana
,
a
more
vain
and
absurd
animal
than
you
was
certainly
never
allowed
to
cumber
the
earth
.
<EOS>
You
had
no
right
to
be
born
,
for
you
make
no
use
of
life
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
living
for
,
in
,
and
with
yourself
,
as
a
reasonable
being
ought
,
you
seek
only
to
fasten
your
feebleness
on
some
other
person
's
strength
:
if
no
one
can
be
found
willing
to
burden
her
or
himself
with
such
a
fat
,
weak
,
puffy
,
useless
thing
,
you
cry
out
that
you
are
ill
-
treated
,
neglected
,
miserable
.
<EOS>
Then
,
too
,
existence
for
you
must
be
a
scene
of
continual
change
and
excitement
,
or
<EOS>
else
the
world
is
a
dungeon
:
you
must
be
admired
,
you
must
be
courted
,
you
must
be
flattered
 
you
must
have
music
,
dancing
,
and
society
 
or
you
languish
,
you
die
away
.
<EOS>
Have
you
no
sense
to
devise
a
system
which
will
make
you
independent
of
all
efforts
,
and
all
wills
,
but
your
own
?
<EOS>
Take
one
day
;
share
it
into
sections
;
to
each
section
apportion
its
task
<EOS>
:
leave
no
stray
unemployed
quarters
of
an
hour
,
ten
minutes
,
five
minutes
 
include
all
;
do
each
piece
of
business
in
its
turn
with
method
,
with
rigid
regularity
.
<EOS>
The
day
will
close
almost
before
you
are
aware
it
has
begun
;
and
you
are
indebted
to
no
one
for
helping
you
to
get
rid
of
one
vacant
moment
:
you
have
had
to
seek
no
one
's
company
,
conversation
,
sympathy
,
forbearance
;
you
have
lived
,
in
short
,
as
an
independent
being
ought
to
do
.
<EOS>
Take
this
advice
:
the
first
and
last
I
shall
offer
you
;
then
you
will
not
want
me
or
any
one
else
,
happen
what
may
.
<EOS>
Neglect
it
 
go
on
as
heretofore
,
craving
,
whining
,
and
idling
 
and
suffer
the
results
of
your
idiocy
,
however
bad
and
insuperable
they
may
be
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
this
plainly
;
and
listen
:
for
though
I
shall
no
more
repeat
what
I
am
now
about
to
say
,
I
shall
steadily
act
on
it
.
<EOS>
After
my
mother
's
death
,
I
wash
my
hands
of
you
:
from
the
day
her
coffin
is
carried
to
the
vault
in
Gateshead
Church
,
you
and
I
will
be
as
separate
as
if
we
had
never
known
each
other
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
think
that
because
we
chanced
to
be
born
of
the
same
parents
,
I
shall
suffer
you
to
fasten
me
down
by
even
the
feeblest
claim
:
I
can
tell
you
this
 
if
the
whole
human
race
,
ourselves
excepted
,
were
swept
away
,
and
we
two
stood
alone
on
the
earth
,
I
would
leave
you
in
the
old
world
,
and
betake
myself
to
the
new
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
closed
her
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
have
spared
yourself
the
trouble
of
delivering
that
tirade
,
"
answered
Georgiana
.
<EOS>
"
Everybody
knows
you
are
the
most
selfish
,
heartless
creature
in
existence
:
<EOS>
and
_
I
_
know
your
spiteful
hatred
towards
me
<EOS>
:
I
have
had
a
specimen
of
it
before
in
the
trick
you
played
me
about
Lord
Edwin
Vere
:
you
could
not
bear
me
to
be
raised
above
you
,
to
have
a
title
,
to
be
received
into
circles
where
you
dare
not
show
your
face
,
and
so
you
acted
the
spy
and
informer
,
and
ruined
my
prospects
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Georgiana
took
out
her
handkerchief
and
blew
her
nose
for
an
hour
afterwards
;
Eliza
sat
cold
,
impassable
,
and
assiduously
industrious
.
  
<EOS>
True
,
generous
feeling
is
made
small
account
of
by
some
,
but
here
were
two
natures
rendered
,
the
one
intolerably
acrid
,
the
other
despicably
savourless
for
the
want
of
it
.
<EOS>
Feeling
without
judgment
is
a
washy
draught
indeed
;
but
judgment
untempered
by
feeling
is
too
bitter
and
husky
a
morsel
for
human
deglutition
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
wet
and
windy
afternoon
<EOS>
:
Georgiana
had
fallen
asleep
on
the
sofa
over
the
perusal
of
a
novel
;
Eliza
was
gone
to
attend
a
saint's
-
day
service
at
the
new
church
 
for
in
matters
of
religion
<EOS>
she
was
a
rigid
formalist
:
no
weather
ever
prevented
the
punctual
discharge
of
what
she
considered
her
devotional
duties
;
fair
or
foul
,
she
went
to
church
thrice
every
Sunday
,
and
as
often
on
week
-
days
as
there
were
prayers
.
  
<EOS>
I
bethought
myself
to
go
upstairs
and
see
how
the
dying
woman
sped
,
who
lay
there
almost
unheeded
:
the
very
servants
paid
her
but
a
remittent
attention
:
the
hired
nurse
,
being
little
looked
after
,
would
slip
out
of
the
room
whenever
she
could
.
<EOS>
Bessie
was
faithful
;
but
she
had
her
own
family
to
mind
,
and
could
only
come
occasionally
to
the
hall
.
<EOS>
I
found
the
sick
-
room
unwatched
,
as
I
had
expected
:
no
nurse
was
there
;
the
patient
lay
still
,
and
seemingly
lethargic
;
her
livid
face
sunk
in
the
pillows
:
the
fire
was
dying
in
the
grate
.
<EOS>
I
renewed
the
fuel
,
re
-
arranged
the
bedclothes
,
gazed
awhile
on
her
who
could
not
now
gaze
on
me
,
and
then
I
moved
away
to
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
The
rain
beat
strongly
against
the
panes
,
the
wind
blew
tempestuously
:
"
One
lies
there
,
"
I
thought
,
"
who
will
soon
be
beyond
the
war
of
earthly
elements
.
<EOS>
Whither
will
that
spirit
 
now
struggling
to
quit
its
material
tenement
 
<EOS>
flit
when
at
length
released
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
pondering
the
great
mystery
,
I
thought
of
Helen
Burns
,
recalled
her
dying
words
 
her
faith
 
her
doctrine
of
the
equality
of
disembodied
souls
.
<EOS>
I
was
still
listening
in
thought
to
her
well
-
remembered
tones
 
still
picturing
her
pale
and
spiritual
aspect
,
her
wasted
face
and
sublime
gaze
,
as
she
lay
on
her
placid
deathbed
,
and
whispered
her
longing
to
be
restored
to
her
divine
Father
's
bosom
 
when
a
feeble
voice
murmured
from
the
couch
behind
:
"
Who
is
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
knew
Mrs.
Reed
had
not
spoken
for
days
:
was
she
reviving
?
<EOS>
I
went
up
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
I
,
Aunt
Reed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
 
I
?
"
was
her
answer
.
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
looking
at
me
with
surprise
and
a
sort
of
alarm
,
but
still
not
wildly
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
a
stranger
to
me
 
<EOS>
where
is
Bessie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
at
the
lodge
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Aunt
,
"
she
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
calls
me
aunt
?
<EOS>
You
are
not
one
of
the
Gibsons
;
and
yet
I
know
you
 
<EOS>
that
face
,
and
the
eyes
and
forehead
,
are
quiet
familiar
to
me
:
you
are
like
 
<EOS>
why
,
you
are
like
Jane
Eyre
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
said
nothing
:
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
of
occasioning
some
shock
by
declaring
my
identity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
am
afraid
it
is
a
mistake
:
my
thoughts
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
I
wished
to
see
Jane
Eyre
,
and
I
fancy
a
likeness
where
none
exists
:
besides
,
in
eight
years
she
must
be
so
changed
.
<EOS>
"
I
now
gently
assured
her
that
I
was
the
person
she
supposed
and
desired
me
to
be
:
and
seeing
that
I
was
understood
,
and
that
her
senses
were
quite
collected
,
I
explained
how
Bessie
had
sent
her
husband
to
fetch
me
from
Thornfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
ill
,
I
know
,
"
she
said
ere
long
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
trying
to
turn
myself
a
few
minutes
since
,
and
find
I
can
not
move
a
limb
.
<EOS>
It
is
as
well
I
should
ease
my
mind
before
I
die
:
<EOS>
what
we
think
little
of
in
health
,
burdens
us
at
such
an
hour
as
the
present
is
to
me
.
<EOS>
Is
the
nurse
here
?
<EOS>
or
is
there
no
one
in
the
room
<EOS>
but
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
assured
her
we
were
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
have
twice
done
you
a
wrong
which
I
regret
now
.
<EOS>
One
was
in
breaking
the
promise
which
I
gave
my
husband
to
bring
you
up
as
my
own
child
;
the
other
 
"
she
stopped
.
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
it
is
of
no
great
importance
,
perhaps
,
"
she
murmured
to
herself
:
"
and
then
I
may
get
better
;
and
to
humble
myself
so
to
her
is
painful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
made
an
effort
to
alter
her
position
,
but
failed
:
her
face
changed
;
she
seemed
to
experience
some
inward
sensation
 
the
precursor
,
perhaps
,
of
the
last
pang
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
must
get
it
over
.
<EOS>
Eternity
is
before
me
:
I
had
better
tell
her
.
 
<EOS>
Go
to
my
dressing
-
case
,
open
it
,
and
take
out
a
letter
you
will
see
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
obeyed
her
directions
.
<EOS>
"
Read
the
letter
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
short
,
and
thus
conceived
:
    
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
 
Will
you
have
the
goodness
to
send
me
the
address
of
my
niece
,
Jane
Eyre
,
and
to
tell
me
how
she
is
?
<EOS>
It
is
my
intention
to
write
shortly
and
desire
her
to
come
to
me
at
Madeira
.
<EOS>
Providence
has
blessed
my
endeavours
to
secure
a
competency
;
and
as
I
am
unmarried
and
childless
,
I
wish
to
adopt
her
during
my
life
,
and
bequeath
her
at
my
death
whatever
I
may
have
to
leave
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
,
Madam
,
&
c.
,
&
c.
,
  
"
JOHN
EYRE
,
Madeira
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
dated
three
years
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
I
never
hear
of
this
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
disliked
you
too
fixedly
and
thoroughly
ever
to
lend
a
hand
in
lifting
you
to
prosperity
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
forget
your
conduct
to
me
,
Jane
 
the
fury
with
which
you
once
turned
on
me
;
the
tone
in
which
you
declared
you
abhorred
me
the
worst
of
anybody
in
the
world
;
the
unchildlike
look
and
voice
with
which
you
affirmed
that
the
very
thought
of
me
made
you
sick
,
and
asserted
that
I
had
treated
you
with
miserable
cruelty
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
forget
my
own
sensations
when
you
thus
started
up
and
poured
out
the
venom
of
your
mind
:
<EOS>
I
felt
fear
as
if
an
animal
that
I
had
struck
or
pushed
had
looked
up
at
me
with
human
eyes
and
cursed
me
in
a
man
's
voice
.
 
<EOS>
Bring
me
some
water
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
make
haste
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Mrs.
Reed
,
"
said
I
,
as
I
offered
her
the
draught
she
required
,
"
think
no
more
of
all
this
,
let
it
pass
away
from
your
mind
.
<EOS>
Forgive
me
for
my
passionate
language
:
I
was
a
child
then
;
eight
,
nine
years
have
passed
since
that
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
heeded
nothing
of
what
I
said
;
but
when
she
had
tasted
the
water
and
drawn
breath
,
she
went
on
thus
    
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
I
could
not
forget
it
;
and
I
took
my
revenge
:
for
you
to
be
adopted
by
your
uncle
,
and
placed
in
a
state
of
ease
and
comfort
,
was
what
I
could
not
endure
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
to
him
;
I
said
I
was
sorry
for
his
disappointment
,
but
Jane
Eyre
was
dead
:
she
had
died
of
typhus
fever
at
Lowood
.
<EOS>
Now
act
as
you
please
:
write
and
contradict
my
assertion
 
expose
my
falsehood
as
soon
as
you
like
.
<EOS>
You
were
born
,
I
think
,
to
be
my
torment
:
my
last
hour
is
racked
by
the
recollection
of
a
deed
<EOS>
which
,
but
for
you
,
I
should
never
have
been
tempted
to
commit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
could
but
be
persuaded
to
think
no
more
of
it
,
aunt
,
and
to
regard
me
with
kindness
and
forgiveness
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
have
a
very
bad
disposition
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
one
to
this
day
I
feel
it
impossible
to
understand
:
how
for
nine
years
you
could
be
patient
and
quiescent
under
any
treatment
,
and
in
the
tenth
break
out
all
fire
and
violence
,
I
can
never
comprehend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
disposition
is
not
so
bad
as
you
think
:
I
am
passionate
,
but
not
vindictive
.
<EOS>
Many
a
time
,
as
a
little
child
,
I
should
have
been
glad
to
love
you
if
you
would
have
let
me
;
and
I
long
earnestly
to
be
reconciled
to
you
now
:
kiss
me
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
approached
my
cheek
to
her
lips
:
she
would
not
touch
it
.
<EOS>
She
said
I
oppressed
her
by
leaning
over
the
bed
,
and
again
demanded
water
.
<EOS>
As
I
laid
her
down
 
for
I
raised
her
and
supported
her
on
my
arm
while
she
drank
 
<EOS>
I
covered
her
ice
-
cold
and
clammy
hand
with
mine
:
the
feeble
fingers
shrank
from
my
touch
 
the
glazing
eyes
shunned
my
gaze
.
  
<EOS>
"
Love
me
,
then
,
or
hate
me
,
as
you
will
,
"
I
said
at
last
,
"
you
have
my
full
and
free
forgiveness
:
ask
now
for
God
's
,
and
be
at
peace
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
,
suffering
woman
!
<EOS>
it
was
too
late
for
her
to
make
now
the
effort
to
change
her
habitual
frame
of
mind
:
living
<EOS>
,
she
had
ever
hated
me
 
dying
,
she
must
hate
me
still
.
  
<EOS>
The
nurse
now
entered
,
and
Bessie
followed
.
<EOS>
I
yet
lingered
half
-
an
-
hour
longer
,
hoping
to
see
some
sign
of
amity
:
but
she
gave
none
.
<EOS>
She
was
fast
relapsing
into
stupor
;
nor
did
her
mind
again
rally
:
at
twelve
o'clock
that
night
she
died
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
present
to
close
her
eyes
,
nor
were
either
of
her
daughters
.
<EOS>
They
came
to
tell
us
the
next
morning
that
all
was
over
.
<EOS>
She
was
by
that
time
laid
out
.
<EOS>
Eliza
and
I
went
to
look
at
her
:
<EOS>
Georgiana
,
who
had
burst
out
into
loud
weeping
,
said
she
dared
not
go
.
<EOS>
There
was
stretched
Sarah
Reed
's
once
robust
and
active
frame
,
rigid
and
still
:
her
eye
of
flint
was
covered
with
its
cold
lid
;
her
brow
and
strong
traits
wore
yet
the
impress
of
her
inexorable
soul
.
<EOS>
A
strange
and
solemn
object
was
that
corpse
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
gazed
on
it
with
gloom
and
pain
:
nothing
soft
,
nothing
sweet
,
nothing
pitying
,
or
hopeful
,
or
subduing
did
it
inspire
;
only
a
grating
anguish
for
_
her
<EOS>
_
woes
 
not
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
my
_
loss
 
and
a
sombre
tearless
dismay
at
the
fearfulness
of
death
in
such
a
form
.
  
<EOS>
Eliza
surveyed
her
parent
calmly
.
<EOS>
After
a
silence
of
some
minutes
she
observed
    
<EOS>
"
With
her
constitution
she
should
have
lived
to
a
good
old
age
:
her
life
was
shortened
by
trouble
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
a
spasm
constricted
her
mouth
for
an
instant
:
<EOS>
as
it
passed
away
she
turned
and
left
the
room
,
and
so
did
I.
Neither
of
us
had
dropt
a
tear
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
had
given
me
but
one
week
's
leave
of
absence
:
yet
a
month
elapsed
before
I
quitted
Gateshead
.
<EOS>
I
wished
to
leave
immediately
after
the
funeral
,
but
Georgiana
entreated
me
to
stay
till
she
could
get
off
to
London
,
whither
<EOS>
she
was
now
at
last
invited
by
her
uncle
,
Mr.
Gibson
,
who
had
come
down
to
direct
his
sister
's
interment
and
settle
the
family
affairs
.
<EOS>
Georgiana
said
she
dreaded
being
left
alone
with
Eliza
;
from
her
she
got
neither
sympathy
in
her
dejection
,
support
in
her
fears
,
nor
aid
in
her
preparations
;
so
I
bore
with
her
feeble
-
minded
wailings
and
selfish
lamentations
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
did
my
best
in
sewing
for
her
and
packing
her
dresses
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
,
that
while
I
worked
,
she
would
idle
;
and
I
thought
to
myself
,
"
If
you
and
I
were
destined
to
live
always
together
,
cousin
,
we
would
commence
matters
on
a
different
footing
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
settle
tamely
down
into
being
the
forbearing
party
;
I
should
assign
you
your
share
of
labour
,
and
compel
you
to
accomplish
it
,
or
else
<EOS>
it
should
be
left
undone
:
I
should
insist
,
also
,
on
your
keeping
some
of
those
drawling
,
half
-
insincere
complaints
hushed
in
your
own
breast
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
because
our
connection
happens
to
be
very
transitory
,
and
comes
at
a
peculiarly
mournful
season
,
that
I
consent
thus
to
render
it
so
patient
and
compliant
on
my
part
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
last
I
saw
Georgiana
off
;
but
now
it
was
Eliza
's
turn
to
request
me
to
stay
another
week
.
<EOS>
Her
plans
required
all
her
time
and
attention
<EOS>
,
she
said
;
she
was
about
to
depart
for
some
unknown
bourne
;
and
all
day
long
she
stayed
in
her
own
room
,
her
door
bolted
within
,
filling
trunks
,
emptying
drawers
,
burning
papers
,
and
holding
no
communication
with
any
one
.
<EOS>
She
wished
me
to
look
after
the
house
,
to
see
callers
,
and
answer
notes
of
condolence
.
  
<EOS>
One
morning
she
told
me
I
was
at
liberty
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
"
she
added
,
"
I
am
obliged
to
you
for
your
valuable
services
and
discreet
conduct
!
<EOS>
There
is
some
difference
between
living
with
such
an
one
as
you
and
with
Georgiana
:
you
perform
your
own
part
in
life
and
burden
no
one
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
,
"
she
continued
,
"
I
set
out
for
the
Continent
.
<EOS>
I
shall
take
up
my
abode
in
a
religious
house
near
Lisle
 
a
nunnery
you
would
call
it
;
there
I
shall
be
quiet
and
unmolested
.
<EOS>
I
shall
devote
myself
for
a
time
to
the
examination
of
the
Roman
Catholic
dogmas
,
and
to
a
careful
study
of
the
workings
of
their
system
:
if
I
find
it
to
be
,
as
I
half
suspect
it
is
,
the
one
best
calculated
to
ensure
the
doing
of
all
things
decently
and
in
order
,
I
shall
embrace
the
tenets
of
Rome
and
probably
take
the
veil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
neither
expressed
surprise
at
this
resolution
nor
attempted
to
dissuade
her
from
it
.
<EOS>
"
The
vocation
will
fit
you
to
a
hair
,
"
I
thought
:
"
much
good
may
it
do
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
When
we
parted
,
she
said
:
"
Good
-
bye
,
cousin
Jane
Eyre
<EOS>
;
I
wish
you
well
:
you
have
some
sense
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
then
returned
:
"
You
are
not
without
sense
,
cousin
Eliza
;
but
what
you
have
,
I
suppose
,
in
another
year
will
be
walled
up
alive
in
a
French
convent
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
is
not
my
business
,
and
so
it
suits
you
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
much
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
the
right
,
"
said
she
;
and
with
these
words
we
each
went
our
separate
way
.
<EOS>
As
I
shall
not
have
occasion
to
refer
either
to
her
or
her
sister
again
,
I
may
as
well
mention
here
,
that
Georgiana
made
an
advantageous
match
with
a
wealthy
worn
-
out
man
of
fashion
,
and
that
Eliza
actually
took
the
veil
,
and
is
at
this
day
superior
of
the
convent
where
she
passed
the
period
of
her
novitiate
,
and
which
she
endowed
with
her
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
How
people
feel
when
they
are
returning
home
from
an
absence
,
long
or
short
,
I
did
not
know
:
<EOS>
I
had
never
experienced
the
sensation
.
<EOS>
I
had
known
what
it
was
to
come
back
to
Gateshead
when
a
child
after
a
long
walk
,
to
be
scolded
for
looking
cold
or
gloomy
;
and
later
,
what
it
was
to
come
back
from
church
to
Lowood
,
to
long
for
a
plenteous
meal
and
a
good
fire
,
and
to
be
unable
to
get
either
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
these
returnings
was
very
pleasant
or
desirable
:
no
magnet
drew
me
to
a
given
point
,
increasing
in
its
strength
of
attraction
the
nearer
I
came
.
<EOS>
The
return
to
Thornfield
was
yet
to
be
tried
.
  
<EOS>
My
journey
seemed
tedious
 
very
tedious
:
fifty
miles
one
day
,
a
night
spent
at
an
inn
;
fifty
miles
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
During
the
first
twelve
hours
I
thought
of
Mrs.
Reed
in
her
last
moments
;
I
saw
her
disfigured
and
discoloured
face
,
and
heard
her
strangely
altered
voice
.
<EOS>
I
mused
on
the
funeral
day
,
the
coffin
,
the
hearse
,
the
black
train
of
tenants
and
servants
 
<EOS>
few
was
the
number
of
relatives
 
the
gaping
vault
,
the
silent
church
,
the
solemn
service
.
<EOS>
Then
I
thought
of
Eliza
and
Georgiana
;
I
beheld
one
the
cynosure
of
a
ball
-
room
,
the
other
the
inmate
of
a
convent
cell
;
and
I
dwelt
on
and
analysed
their
separate
peculiarities
of
person
and
character
.
<EOS>
The
evening
arrival
at
the
great
town
of
 
scattered
these
thoughts
;
night
gave
them
quite
another
turn
:
laid
down
on
my
traveller
's
bed
,
I
left
reminiscence
for
anticipation
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
going
back
to
Thornfield
:
<EOS>
but
how
long
was
I
to
stay
there
?
<EOS>
Not
long
;
of
that
I
was
sure
.
<EOS>
I
had
heard
from
Mrs.
Fairfax
in
the
interim
of
my
absence
:
the
party
at
the
hall
was
dispersed
;
Mr.
Rochester
had
left
for
London
three
weeks
ago
,
but
he
was
then
expected
to
return
in
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
surmised
that
he
was
gone
to
make
arrangements
for
his
wedding
,
as
he
had
talked
of
purchasing
a
new
carriage
:
she
said
the
idea
of
his
marrying
Miss
Ingram
still
seemed
strange
to
her
;
but
from
what
everybody
said
,
and
from
what
she
had
herself
seen
,
she
could
no
longer
doubt
that
the
event
would
shortly
take
place
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
strangely
incredulous
if
you
did
doubt
it
,
"
was
my
mental
comment
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
doubt
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
question
followed
,
"
Where
was
I
to
go
?
<EOS>
"
I
dreamt
of
Miss
Ingram
all
the
night
:
in
a
vivid
morning
dream
I
saw
her
closing
the
gates
of
Thornfield
against
me
and
pointing
me
out
another
road
;
and
Mr.
Rochester
looked
on
with
his
arms
folded
 
smiling
sardonically
,
as
it
seemed
,
at
both
her
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
not
notified
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
the
exact
day
of
my
return
;
for
I
did
not
wish
either
car
or
carriage
to
meet
me
at
Millcote
.
<EOS>
I
proposed
to
walk
the
distance
quietly
by
myself
;
and
very
quietly
,
after
leaving
my
box
in
the
ostler
's
care
,
did
I
slip
away
from
the
George
Inn
,
about
six
o'clock
of
a
June
evening
,
and
take
the
old
road
to
Thornfield
:
a
road
which
lay
chiefly
through
fields
,
and
was
now
little
frequented
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
bright
or
splendid
summer
evening
,
though
fair
and
soft
:
the
haymakers
were
at
work
all
along
the
road
;
and
the
sky
,
though
far
from
cloudless
,
was
such
as
promised
well
for
the
future
:
<EOS>
its
blue
 
where
blue
was
visible
 
was
mild
and
settled
,
and
its
cloud
strata
high
and
thin
.
<EOS>
The
west
,
too
,
was
warm
:
no
watery
gleam
chilled
it
 
<EOS>
it
seemed
as
if
there
was
a
fire
lit
,
an
altar
burning
behind
its
screen
of
marbled
vapour
,
and
out
of
apertures
shone
a
golden
redness
.
  
<EOS>
I
felt
glad
as
the
road
shortened
before
me
:
<EOS>
so
glad
that
I
stopped
once
to
ask
myself
what
that
joy
meant
:
and
to
remind
reason
that
it
was
not
to
my
home
<EOS>
I
was
going
,
or
to
a
permanent
resting
-
place
,
or
to
a
place
where
fond
friends
looked
out
for
me
and
waited
my
arrival
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
will
smile
you
a
calm
welcome
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
I
;
"
and
little
Adele
will
clap
her
hands
and
jump
to
see
you
:
but
you
know
very
well
you
are
thinking
of
another
than
they
,
and
that
he
is
not
thinking
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
what
is
so
headstrong
as
youth
?
<EOS>
What
so
blind
as
inexperience
?
<EOS>
These
affirmed
that
it
was
pleasure
enough
to
have
the
privilege
of
again
looking
on
Mr.
Rochester
,
whether
he
looked
on
me
or
not
;
and
they
added
 
"
Hasten
!
<EOS>
hasten
!
<EOS>
be
with
him
while
you
may
:
but
a
few
more
days
or
weeks
,
at
most
,
and
you
are
parted
from
him
for
ever
!
"
<EOS>
And
then
I
strangled
a
new
-
born
agony
 
a
deformed
thing
which
I
could
not
persuade
myself
to
own
and
rear
 
and
ran
on
.
  
<EOS>
They
are
making
hay
,
too
,
in
Thornfield
meadows
:
or
rather
,
the
labourers
are
just
quitting
their
work
,
and
returning
home
with
their
rakes
on
their
shoulders
,
now
,
at
the
hour
I
arrive
.
<EOS>
I
have
but
a
field
or
two
to
traverse
,
and
then
I
shall
cross
the
road
and
reach
the
gates
.
<EOS>
How
full
the
hedges
are
of
roses
!
<EOS>
But
I
have
no
time
to
gather
any
;
I
want
to
be
at
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
passed
a
tall
briar
,
shooting
leafy
and
flowery
branches
across
the
path
;
I
see
the
narrow
stile
with
stone
steps
;
and
I
see
 
Mr.
Rochester
sitting
there
,
a
book
and
a
pencil
in
his
hand
;
he
is
writing
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
he
is
not
a
ghost
;
yet
every
nerve
I
have
is
unstrung
:
for
a
moment
I
am
beyond
my
own
mastery
.
<EOS>
What
does
it
mean
?
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
I
should
tremble
in
this
way
when
I
saw
him
,
or
lose
my
voice
or
the
power
of
motion
in
his
presence
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
back
as
soon
as
I
can
stir
:
<EOS>
I
need
not
make
an
absolute
fool
of
myself
.
<EOS>
I
know
another
way
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
does
not
signify
if
I
knew
twenty
ways
;
for
he
has
seen
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hillo
!
"
<EOS>
he
cries
;
and
he
puts
up
his
book
and
his
pencil
.
<EOS>
"
There
you
are
!
<EOS>
Come
on
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
do
come
on
;
though
in
what
fashion
I
know
not
;
being
scarcely
cognisant
of
my
movements
,
and
solicitous
only
to
appear
calm
;
and
,
above
all
,
to
control
the
working
muscles
of
my
face
 
which
I
feel
rebel
insolently
against
my
will
,
and
struggle
to
express
what
I
had
resolved
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
a
veil
 
<EOS>
it
is
down
:
I
may
make
shift
yet
to
behave
with
decent
composure
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
this
is
Jane
Eyre
?
<EOS>
Are
you
coming
from
Millcote
,
and
on
foot
?
<EOS>
Yes
 
just
one
of
your
tricks
:
not
to
send
for
a
carriage
,
and
come
clattering
over
street
and
road
like
a
common
mortal
,
but
to
steal
into
the
vicinage
of
your
home
along
with
twilight
,
just
as
if
you
were
a
dream
or
a
shade
.
<EOS>
What
the
deuce
have
you
done
with
yourself
this
last
month
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
with
my
aunt
,
sir
,
who
is
dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
true
Janian
reply
!
<EOS>
Good
angels
be
my
guard
!
<EOS>
She
comes
from
the
other
world
 
from
the
abode
of
people
who
are
dead
;
and
tells
me
so
when
she
meets
me
alone
here
in
the
gloaming
!
<EOS>
If
I
dared
,
I
'd
touch
you
,
to
see
if
you
are
substance
or
shadow
,
you
elf
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
'd
as
soon
offer
to
take
hold
of
a
blue
_
ignis
fatuus
_
light
in
a
marsh
.
<EOS>
Truant
!
truant
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
when
he
had
paused
an
instant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Absent
from
me
a
whole
month
,
and
forgetting
me
quite
,
I
'll
be
sworn
!
"
  
I
knew
there
would
be
pleasure
in
meeting
my
master
again
,
even
though
broken
by
the
fear
that
he
was
so
soon
to
cease
to
be
my
master
,
and
by
the
knowledge
that
I
was
nothing
to
him
:
but
there
was
ever
in
Mr.
Rochester
(
so
at
least
I
thought
)
<EOS>
such
a
wealth
of
the
power
of
communicating
happiness
,
that
to
taste
but
of
the
crumbs
he
scattered
to
stray
and
stranger
birds
like
me
,
was
to
feast
genially
.
<EOS>
His
last
words
were
balm
:
they
seemed
to
imply
that
it
imported
something
to
him
whether
I
forgot
him
or
not
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
spoken
of
Thornfield
as
my
home
 
would
that
it
were
my
home
!
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
leave
the
stile
,
and
I
hardly
liked
to
ask
to
go
by
.
<EOS>
I
inquired
soon
if
he
had
not
been
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
suppose
you
found
that
out
by
second
-
sight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Fairfax
told
me
in
a
letter
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
did
she
inform
you
what
I
went
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
sir
!
<EOS>
Everybody
knew
your
errand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
see
the
carriage
,
Jane
,
and
tell
me
if
you
do
n't
think
it
will
suit
Mrs.
Rochester
exactly
;
and
whether
she
wo
n't
look
like
Queen
Boadicea
,
leaning
back
against
those
purple
cushions
.
<EOS>
I
wish
,
Jane
,
I
were
a
trifle
better
adapted
to
match
with
her
externally
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
now
,
fairy
as
you
are
 
ca
n't
you
give
me
a
charm
,
or
a
philter
,
or
something
of
that
sort
,
to
make
me
a
handsome
man
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
past
the
power
of
magic
,
sir
;
"
and
,
in
thought
,
I
added
,
"
A
loving
eye
is
all
the
charm
needed
:
to
such
you
are
handsome
enough
;
or
rather
your
sternness
has
a
power
beyond
beauty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
had
sometimes
read
my
unspoken
thoughts
with
an
acumen
to
me
incomprehensible
:
in
the
present
instance
he
took
no
notice
of
my
abrupt
vocal
response
;
but
he
smiled
at
me
with
a
certain
smile
he
had
of
his
own
,
and
which
he
used
but
on
rare
occasions
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
think
it
too
good
for
common
purposes
:
it
was
the
real
sunshine
of
feeling
 
he
shed
it
over
me
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pass
,
Janet
,
"
said
he
,
making
room
for
me
to
cross
the
stile
:
"
go
up
home
,
and
stay
your
weary
little
wandering
feet
at
a
friend
's
threshold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
All
I
had
now
to
do
was
to
obey
him
in
silence
:
<EOS>
no
need
for
me
to
colloquise
further
.
<EOS>
I
got
over
the
stile
without
a
word
,
and
meant
to
leave
him
calmly
.
<EOS>
An
impulse
held
me
fast
 
<EOS>
a
force
turned
me
round
.
<EOS>
I
said
 
or
something
in
me
said
for
me
,
and
in
spite
of
me
    
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Mr.
Rochester
,
for
your
great
kindness
.
<EOS>
I
am
strangely
glad
to
get
back
again
to
you
:
and
wherever
you
are
is
my
home
 
<EOS>
my
only
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
walked
on
so
fast
that
even
he
could
hardly
have
overtaken
me
<EOS>
had
he
tried
.
<EOS>
Little
Adele
was
half
wild
with
delight
when
she
saw
me
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
received
me
with
her
usual
plain
friendliness
.
<EOS>
Leah
smiled
,
and
even
Sophie
bid
me
"
bon
soir
"
with
glee
.
<EOS>
This
was
very
pleasant
;
there
is
no
happiness
like
that
of
being
loved
by
your
fellow
-
creatures
,
and
feeling
that
your
presence
is
an
addition
to
their
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
I
that
evening
shut
my
eyes
resolutely
against
the
future
:
I
stopped
my
ears
against
the
voice
that
kept
warning
me
of
near
separation
and
coming
grief
.
<EOS>
When
tea
was
over
and
Mrs.
Fairfax
had
taken
her
knitting
,
and
I
had
assumed
a
low
seat
near
her
,
and
<EOS>
Adele
,
kneeling
on
the
carpet
,
had
nestled
close
up
to
me
,
and
a
sense
of
mutual
affection
seemed
to
surround
us
with
a
ring
of
golden
peace
,
I
uttered
a
silent
prayer
that
we
might
not
be
parted
far
or
soon
;
but
when
,
as
we
thus
sat
,
Mr.
Rochester
entered
,
unannounced
,
and
looking
at
us
,
seemed
to
take
pleasure
in
the
spectacle
of
a
group
<EOS>
so
amicable
 
<EOS>
when
he
said
he
supposed
the
old
lady
was
all
right
now
that
she
had
got
her
adopted
daughter
back
again
,
and
added
that
he
saw
Adele
was
"
prete
<EOS>
a
croquer
sa
petite
maman
Anglaise
"
 
<EOS>
I
half
ventured
to
hope
that
he
would
,
even
after
his
marriage
,
keep
us
together
somewhere
under
the
shelter
of
his
protection
,
and
not
quite
exiled
from
the
sunshine
of
his
presence
.
  
<EOS>
A
fortnight
of
dubious
calm
succeeded
my
return
to
Thornfield
Hall
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
said
of
the
master
's
marriage
,
and
I
saw
no
preparation
going
on
for
such
an
event
.
<EOS>
Almost
every
day
I
asked
Mrs.
Fairfax
if
she
had
yet
heard
anything
decided
:
her
answer
was
always
in
the
negative
.
<EOS>
Once
she
said
she
had
actually
put
the
question
to
Mr.
Rochester
as
to
when
he
was
going
to
bring
his
bride
home
;
but
he
had
answered
her
only
by
a
joke
and
one
of
his
queer
looks
,
and
she
could
not
tell
what
to
make
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
One
thing
specially
surprised
me
,
and
that
was
,
there
were
no
journeyings
backward
and
forward
,
<EOS>
no
visits
to
Ingram
Park
:
to
be
sure
it
was
twenty
miles
off
,
on
the
borders
of
another
county
;
but
what
was
that
distance
to
an
ardent
lover
?
<EOS>
To
so
practised
and
indefatigable
a
horseman
as
Mr.
Rochester
,
it
would
be
but
a
morning
's
ride
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
cherish
hopes
<EOS>
I
had
no
right
to
conceive
:
that
the
match
was
broken
off
;
that
rumour
had
been
mistaken
;
that
one
or
both
parties
had
changed
their
minds
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
look
at
my
master
's
face
to
see
if
it
were
sad
or
fierce
;
but
I
could
not
remember
the
time
when
it
had
been
so
uniformly
clear
of
clouds
or
evil
feelings
.
<EOS>
If
,
in
the
moments
I
and
my
pupil
spent
with
him
,
I
lacked
spirits
and
sank
into
inevitable
dejection
,
he
became
even
gay
.
<EOS>
Never
had
he
called
me
more
frequently
to
his
presence
;
never
been
kinder
to
me
when
there
 
and
,
alas
!
<EOS>
never
had
I
loved
him
so
well
.
    
<EOS>
A
splendid
Midsummer
shone
over
England
:
<EOS>
skies
so
pure
,
suns
<EOS>
so
radiant
as
were
then
seen
in
long
succession
<EOS>
,
seldom
favour
even
singly
,
our
wave-
girt
land
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
a
band
of
Italian
days
had
come
from
the
South
,
like
a
flock
of
glorious
passenger
birds
,
and
lighted
to
rest
them
on
the
cliffs
of
Albion
.
<EOS>
The
hay
was
all
got
in
;
the
fields
round
Thornfield
were
green
and
shorn
;
the
roads
white
and
baked
;
the
trees
were
in
their
dark
prime
;
hedge
and
wood
,
full
-
leaved
and
deeply
tinted
,
contrasted
well
with
the
sunny
hue
of
the
cleared
meadows
between
.
  
<EOS>
On
Midsummer
-
eve
,
Adele
,
weary
with
gathering
wild
strawberries
in
Hay
Lane
half
the
day
,
had
gone
to
bed
with
the
sun
.
<EOS>
I
watched
her
drop
asleep
,
and
when
I
left
her
,
I
sought
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
now
the
sweetest
hour
of
the
twenty
-
four
:
 
<EOS>
"
Day
its
fervid
fires
had
wasted
,
"
and
dew
fell
cool
on
panting
plain
and
scorched
summit
.
<EOS>
Where
the
sun
had
gone
down
in
simple
state
 
pure
of
the
pomp
of
clouds
 
spread
a
solemn
purple
,
burning
with
the
light
of
red
jewel
and
furnace
flame
at
one
point
,
on
one
hill
-
peak
,
and
extending
high
and
wide
,
soft
and
still
softer
,
over
half
heaven
.
<EOS>
The
east
had
its
own
charm
or
fine
deep
blue
,
and
its
own
modest
gem
,
a
casino
and
solitary
star
:
soon
it
would
boast
the
moon
;
but
she
was
yet
beneath
the
horizon
.
  
<EOS>
I
walked
a
while
on
the
pavement
;
but
a
subtle
,
well
-
known
scent
 
that
of
a
cigar
 
stole
from
some
window
;
I
saw
the
library
casement
open
a
handbreadth
;
I
knew
I
might
be
watched
thence
;
so
I
went
apart
into
the
orchard
.
<EOS>
No
nook
in
the
grounds
more
sheltered
and
more
Eden
-
like
<EOS>
;
it
was
full
of
trees
,
it
bloomed
with
flowers
:
a
very
high
wall
shut
it
out
from
the
court
,
on
one
side
;
on
the
other
,
a
beech
avenue
screened
it
from
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
At
the
bottom
was
a
sunk
fence
;
its
sole
separation
from
lonely
fields
:
a
winding
walk
,
bordered
with
laurels
and
terminating
in
a
giant
horse
-
chestnut
,
circled
at
the
base
by
a
seat
,
led
down
to
the
fence
.
<EOS>
Here
one
could
wander
unseen
.
<EOS>
While
such
honey
-
dew
fell
,
such
silence
reigned
,
such
gloaming
gathered
,
I
felt
as
if
I
could
haunt
such
shade
for
ever
;
but
in
threading
the
flower
and
fruit
parterres
at
the
upper
part
of
the
enclosure
,
enticed
there
by
the
light
the
now
rising
moon
cast
on
this
more
open
quarter
,
my
step
is
stayed
 
not
by
sound
,
not
by
sight
,
but
once
more
by
a
warning
fragrance
.
  
<EOS>
Sweet
-
briar
and
southernwood
,
jasmine
,
pink
,
and
rose
have
long
been
yielding
their
evening
sacrifice
of
incense
:
this
new
scent
is
neither
of
shrub
nor
flower
;
it
is
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
<EOS>
well
 
<EOS>
it
is
Mr.
Rochester
's
cigar
.
<EOS>
I
look
round
and
I
listen
.
<EOS>
I
see
trees
laden
with
ripening
fruit
.
<EOS>
I
hear
a
nightingale
warbling
in
a
wood
half
a
mile
off
;
no
moving
form
is
visible
,
no
coming
step
audible
;
but
that
perfume
increases
:
I
must
flee
.
<EOS>
I
make
for
the
wicket
leading
to
the
shrubbery
,
and
I
see
Mr.
Rochester
entering
.
<EOS>
I
step
aside
into
the
ivy
recess
;
he
will
not
stay
long
:
he
will
soon
return
whence
he
came
,
and
if
I
sit
still
he
will
never
see
me
.
  
<EOS>
But
no
 
eventide
is
as
pleasant
to
him
as
to
me
,
and
this
antique
garden
as
attractive
;
and
he
strolls
on
,
now
lifting
the
gooseberry
-
tree
branches
to
look
at
the
fruit
,
large
as
plums
,
with
which
they
are
laden
;
now
taking
a
ripe
cherry
from
the
wall
;
now
stooping
towards
a
knot
of
flowers
,
either
to
inhale
their
fragrance
or
to
admire
the
dew
-
beads
on
their
petals
.
<EOS>
A
great
moth
goes
humming
by
me
;
it
alights
on
a
plant
at
Mr.
Rochester
's
foot
:
<EOS>
he
sees
it
,
and
bends
to
examine
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
he
has
his
back
towards
me
,
"
thought
I
,
"
and
he
is
occupied
too
;
perhaps
,
if
I
walk
softly
,
I
can
slip
away
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
trode
on
an
edging
of
turf
that
the
crackle
of
the
pebbly
gravel
might
not
betray
me
:
he
was
standing
among
the
beds
at
a
yard
or
two
distant
from
where
I
had
to
pass
;
the
moth
apparently
engaged
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
get
by
very
well
,
"
I
meditated
.
<EOS>
As
I
crossed
his
shadow
,
thrown
long
over
the
garden
by
the
moon
,
not
yet
risen
high
,
he
said
quietly
,
without
turning
    
"
Jane
,
come
and
look
at
this
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
made
no
noise
:
he
had
not
eyes
behind
 
could
his
shadow
feel
?
<EOS>
I
started
at
first
,
and
then
I
approached
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
at
his
wings
,
"
said
he
,
"
he
reminds
me
rather
of
a
West
Indian
insect
;
one
does
not
often
see
so
large
and
gay
a
night
-
rover
in
England
;
there
!
<EOS>
he
is
flown
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
moth
roamed
away
.
<EOS>
I
was
sheepishly
retreating
also
;
but
Mr.
Rochester
followed
me
,
and
when
we
reached
the
wicket
,
he
said
    
"
Turn
back
:
on
so
lovely
a
night
<EOS>
it
is
a
shame
to
sit
in
the
house
;
and
surely
no
one
can
wish
to
go
to
bed
while
sunset
is
thus
at
meeting
with
moonrise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
one
of
my
faults
,
that
though
my
tongue
is
sometimes
prompt
enough
at
an
answer
,
there
are
times
when
it
sadly
fails
me
in
framing
an
excuse
;
and
always
the
lapse
occurs
at
some
crisis
,
when
a
facile
word
or
plausible
pretext
is
specially
wanted
to
get
me
out
of
painful
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
like
to
walk
at
this
hour
alone
with
Mr.
Rochester
in
the
shadowy
orchard
;
but
I
could
not
find
a
reason
to
allege
for
leaving
him
.
<EOS>
I
followed
with
lagging
step
,
and
thoughts
busily
bent
on
discovering
a
means
of
extrication
;
but
he
himself
looked
so
composed
and
<EOS>
so
grave
<EOS>
also
,
I
became
ashamed
of
feeling
any
confusion
:
<EOS>
the
evil
 
<EOS>
if
evil
existent
or
prospective
there
was
 
seemed
to
lie
with
me
only
;
his
mind
was
unconscious
and
quiet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
"
he
recommenced
,
as
we
entered
the
laurel
walk
,
and
slowly
strayed
down
in
the
direction
of
the
sunk
fence
and
the
horse
-
chestnut
,
"
Thornfield
is
a
pleasant
place
in
summer
,
is
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
become
in
some
degree
attached
to
the
house
,
 
you
,
who
have
an
eye
for
natural
beauties
,
and
a
good
deal
of
the
organ
of
Adhesiveness
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
attached
to
it
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
though
I
do
n't
comprehend
how
it
is
,
I
perceive
you
have
acquired
a
degree
of
regard
for
that
foolish
little
child
Adele
,
too
;
and
even
for
simple
dame
Fairfax
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
;
in
different
ways
,
I
have
an
affection
for
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
would
be
sorry
to
part
with
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
"
Pity
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
and
sighed
and
paused
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
always
the
way
of
events
in
this
life
,
"
he
continued
presently
:
"
no
sooner
have
you
got
settled
in
a
pleasant
resting
-
place
,
than
a
voice
calls
out
to
you
to
rise
and
move
on
,
for
the
hour
of
repose
is
expired
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Must
I
move
on
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Must
I
leave
Thornfield
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
must
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
,
Janet
,
but
I
believe
indeed
you
must
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
blow
:
but
I
did
not
let
it
prostrate
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
I
shall
be
ready
when
the
order
to
march
comes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
come
now
 
<EOS>
I
must
give
it
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
_
are
_
going
to
be
married

sir

<EOS>
"
Ex

act

ly
 
pre

cise

ly
:
with
your
usual
acuteness
,
you
have
hit
the
nail
straight
on
the
head

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Soon
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
soon
,
my
 
that
is
,
Miss
Eyre
:
<EOS>
and
you
'll
remember
,
Jane
,
the
first
time
I
,
or
Rumour
,
plainly
intimated
to
you
that
it
was
my
intention
to
put
my
old
bachelor
's
neck
into
the
sacred
noose
,
to
enter
into
the
holy
estate
of
matrimony
 
to
take
Miss
Ingram
to
my
bosom
<EOS>
,
in
short
(
she
's
an
extensive
armful
:
but
that
's
not
to
the
point
 
one
ca
n't
have
too
much
of
such
a
very
excellent
thing
as
my
beautiful
Blanche
)
:
<EOS>
well
,
as
I
was
saying
 
listen
to
me
,
Jane
!
<EOS>
You
're
not
turning
your
head
to
look
after
more
moths
,
are
you
?
<EOS>
That
was
only
a
lady
-
clock
,
child
,
"
flying
away
home
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
remind
you
that
it
was
you
who
first
said
to
me
,
with
that
discretion
I
respect
in
you
 
with
that
foresight
,
prudence
,
and
humility
which
befit
your
responsible
and
dependent
position
 
<EOS>
that
in
case
I
married
Miss
Ingram
,
both
you
and
little
Adele
<EOS>
had
better
trot
forthwith
.
<EOS>
I
pass
over
the
sort
of
slur
conveyed
in
this
suggestion
on
the
character
of
my
beloved
;
indeed
,
when
you
are
far
away
,
Janet
,
I
'll
try
to
forget
it
:
I
shall
notice
only
its
wisdom
;
which
is
such
that
I
have
made
it
my
law
of
action
.
<EOS>
Adele
must
go
to
school
;
and
you
,
Miss
Eyre
,
must
get
a
new
situation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
I
will
advertise
immediately
:
and
meantime
,
I
suppose
 
"
I
was
going
to
say
,
"
I
suppose
I
may
stay
here
,
till
I
find
another
shelter
to
betake
myself
to
:
"
but
I
stopped
,
feeling
it
would
not
do
to
risk
a
long
sentence
,
for
my
voice
was
not
quite
under
command
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
about
a
month
I
hope
to
be
a
bridegroom
,
"
continued
Mr.
Rochester
;
"
and
in
the
interim
,
I
shall
myself
look
out
for
employment
and
an
asylum
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
;
I
am
sorry
to
give
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
need
to
apologise
!
<EOS>
I
consider
that
when
a
dependent
does
her
duty
as
well
as
you
have
done
yours
,
she
has
a
sort
of
claim
upon
her
employer
for
any
little
assistance
he
can
conveniently
render
her
;
indeed
I
have
already
,
through
my
future
mother
-
in
-
law
,
heard
of
a
place
that
I
think
will
suit
:
it
is
to
undertake
the
education
of
the
five
daughters
of
Mrs.
Dionysius
O'Gall
of
Bitternutt
Lodge
,
Connaught
,
Ireland
.
<EOS>
You
'll
like
Ireland
<EOS>
,
I
think
:
they
're
such
warm
-
hearted
people
there
,
they
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
is
a
long
way
off
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
matter
 
a
girl
of
your
sense
will
not
object
to
the
voyage
or
the
distance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
the
voyage
,
but
the
distance
:
<EOS>
and
then
the
sea
is
a
barrier
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
From
what
,
Jane
?

<EOS>
From
England
and
from
Thornfield
:
<EOS>
and
 
"
  
"
Well
?
"
  
"
From
_
you
_
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
said
this
almost
involuntarily
,
and
,
with
as
little
sanction
of
free
will
,
my
tears
gushed
out
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
cry
so
as
to
be
heard
,
however
;
I
avoided
sobbing
.
<EOS>
The
thought
of
Mrs.
O'Gall
and
Bitternutt
Lodge
struck
cold
to
my
heart
;
and
colder
the
thought
of
all
the
brine
and
foam
,
destined
,
as
it
seemed
,
to
rush
between
me
and
the
master
at
whose
side
I
now
walked
,
and
coldest
the
remembrance
of
the
wider
ocean
 
wealth
,
caste
,
custom
intervened
between
me
and
what
I
naturally
and
inevitably
loved
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
long
way
,
"
I
again
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
to
be
sure
;
and
when
you
get
to
Bitternutt
Lodge
,
Connaught
,
Ireland
,
I
shall
never
see
you
again
,
Jane
:
that
's
morally
certain
.
<EOS>
I
never
go
over
to
Ireland
,
not
having
myself
much
of
a
fancy
for
the
country
.
<EOS>
We
have
been
good
friends
,
Jane
;
have
we
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
friends
are
on
the
eve
of
separation
,
they
like
to
spend
the
little
time
that
remains
to
them
close
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
we
'll
talk
over
the
voyage
and
the
parting
quietly
half
-
an
-
hour
or
so
,
while
the
stars
enter
into
their
shining
life
up
in
heaven
yonder
:
here
is
the
chestnut
tree
:
here
is
the
bench
at
its
old
roots
.
<EOS>
Come
,
we
will
sit
there
in
peace
to
-
night
,
though
we
should
never
more
be
destined
to
sit
there
together
.
"
<EOS>
He
seated
me
and
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
long
way
to
Ireland
,
Janet
,
and
I
am
sorry
to
send
my
little
friend
on
such
weary
travels
:
<EOS>
but
if
I
ca
n't
do
better
,
how
is
it
to
be
helped
?
<EOS>
Are
you
anything
akin
to
me
,
do
you
think
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
risk
no
sort
of
answer
by
this
time
:
my
heart
was
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
sometimes
have
a
queer
feeling
with
regard
to
you
 
especially
when
you
are
near
me
,
as
now
:
it
is
as
if
I
had
a
string
somewhere
under
my
left
ribs
,
tightly
and
inextricably
knotted
to
a
similar
string
situated
in
the
corresponding
quarter
of
your
little
frame
.
<EOS>
And
if
that
boisterous
Channel
,
and
two
hundred
miles
or
so
of
land
come
broad
between
us
<EOS>
,
I
am
afraid
that
cord
of
communion
will
be
snapt
;
and
then
I
've
a
nervous
notion
I
should
take
to
bleeding
inwardly
.
<EOS>
As
for
you
,
 
you
'd
forget
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
_
never
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
should
<EOS>
,
sir
:
<EOS>
you
know
 
<EOS>
"
Impossible
to
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
do
you
hear
that
nightingale
singing
in
the
wood
?
<EOS>
Listen
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
listening
,
I
sobbed
convulsively
;
for
I
could
repress
what
I
endured
no
longer
;
I
was
obliged
to
yield
,
and
I
was
shaken
from
head
to
foot
with
acute
distress
.
<EOS>
When
I
did
speak
,
it
was
only
to
express
an
impetuous
wish
that
I
had
never
been
born
,
or
never
come
to
Thornfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
you
are
sorry
to
leave
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
vehemence
of
emotion
,
stirred
by
grief
and
love
within
me
,
was
claiming
mastery
,
and
struggling
for
full
sway
,
and
asserting
a
right
to
predominate
,
to
overcome
,
to
live
,
rise
,
and
reign
at
last
:
yes
,
 
and
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
grieve
to
leave
Thornfield
:
<EOS>
I
love
Thornfield
:
 
<EOS>
I
love
it
,
because
I
have
lived
in
it
a
full
and
delightful
life
,
 
momentarily
at
least
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
trampled
on
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
petrified
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
buried
with
inferior
minds
,
and
excluded
from
every
glimpse
of
communion
with
what
is
bright
and
energetic
and
high
.
<EOS>
I
have
talked
,
face
to
face
,
with
what
I
reverence
,
with
what
I
delight
in
,
 
with
an
original
,
a
vigorous
,
an
expanded
mind
.
<EOS>
I
have
known
you
,
Mr.
Rochester
;
and
it
strikes
me
with
terror
and
anguish
to
feel
I
absolutely
must
be
torn
from
you
for
ever
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
necessity
of
departure
;
and
it
is
like
looking
on
the
necessity
of
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
do
you
see
the
necessity
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
?
You
,
sir
,
have
placed
it
before
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
what
shape
?
"
  
"
In
the
shape
of
Miss
Ingram
;
a
noble
and
beautiful
woman
,
 
your
bride
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
bride
!
<EOS>
What
bride
?
<EOS>
I
have
no
bride
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
I
will
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
!
"
<EOS>
He
set
his
teeth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
must
go
:
 
<EOS>
you
have
said
it
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
:
you
must
stay
!
<EOS>
I
swear
it
 
and
the
oath
shall
be
kept
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
I
must
go
!
"
<EOS>
I
retorted
,
roused
to
something
like
passion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
can
stay
to
become
nothing
to
you
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
am
an
automaton
?
 
<EOS>
a
machine
without
feelings
?
<EOS>
and
can
bear
to
have
my
morsel
of
bread
snatched
from
my
lips
,
and
my
drop
of
living
water
dashed
from
my
cup
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
,
because
I
am
poor
,
obscure
,
plain
,
and
little
,
I
am
soulless
and
heartless
?
<EOS>
You
think
wrong
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
as
much
soul
as
you
,
 
and
full
as
much
heart
!
<EOS>
And
if
God
had
gifted
me
with
some
beauty
and
much
wealth
,
I
should
have
made
it
as
hard
for
you
to
leave
me
,
as
it
is
now
for
me
to
leave
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
talking
to
you
now
through
the
medium
of
custom
,
conventionalities
,
nor
even
of
mortal
flesh
;
 
it
is
my
spirit
that
addresses
your
spirit
;
just
as
if
both
had
passed
through
the
grave
,
and
we
stood
at
God
's
feet
,
equal
,
 
as
we
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
we
are
!
"
repeated
Mr.
Rochester
 
"
<EOS>
so
,
"
he
added
,
enclosing
me
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
Gathering
me
to
his
breast
,
pressing
his
lips
on
my
lips
:
"
so
,
Jane
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
so
,
sir
,
"
I
rejoined
:
"
and
yet
not
so
;
for
you
are
a
married
man
 
or
as
good
as
a
married
man
,
and
we
d
to
one
inferior
to
you
 
to
one
with
whom
you
have
no
sympathy
 
whom
I
do
not
believe
you
truly
love
;
for
I
have
seen
and
heard
you
sneer
at
her
.
<EOS>
I
would
scorn
such
a
union
:
therefore
I
am
better
than
you
 
let
me
go
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
To
Ireland
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
 
to
Ireland
.
<EOS>
I
have
spoken
my
mind
,
and
can
go
anywhere
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Jane
,
be
still
;
do
n't
struggle
so
,
like
a
wild
frantic
bird
that
is
rending
its
own
plumage
in
its
desperation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
no
bird
;
and
no
net
ensnares
me
;
I
am
a
free
human
being
with
an
independent
will
,
which
I
now
exert
to
leave
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Another
effort
set
me
at
liberty
,
and
I
stood
erect
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
your
will
shall
decide
your
destiny
,
"
he
said
:
"
I
offer
you
my
hand
,
my
heart
,
and
a
share
of
all
my
possessions
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
play
a
farce
,
which
I
merely
laugh
at
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
to
pass
through
life
at
my
side
 
to
be
my
second
self
,
and
best
earthly
companion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
that
fate
you
have
already
made
your
choice
,
and
must
abide
by
it
.
"
  
"
Jane
,
be
still
a
few
moments
:
you
are
over
-
excited
:
I
will
be
still
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
waft
of
wind
came
sweeping
down
the
laurel
-
walk
,
and
trembled
through
the
boughs
of
the
chestnut
:
it
wandered
away
 
away
 
to
an
indefinite
distance
 
it
died
.
<EOS>
The
nightingale
's
song
was
then
the
only
voice
of
the
hour
:
in
listening
to
it
,
I
again
wept
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
sat
quiet
,
looking
at
me
gently
and
seriously
.
<EOS>
Some
time
passed
before
he
spoke
;
he
at
last
said
    
"
Come
to
my
side
,
Jane
,
and
let
us
explain
and
understand
one
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
again
come
to
your
side
:
I
am
torn
away
now
,
and
can
not
return
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Jane
,
I
summon
you
as
my
wife
:
<EOS>
it
is
you
only
I
intend
to
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
silent
:
I
thought
he
mocked
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Jane
 
come
hither
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
bride
stands
between
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
rose
,
and
with
a
stride
reached
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
bride
is
here
,
"
he
said
,
again
drawing
me
to
him
,
"
because
my
equal
is
here
,
and
my
likeness
.
<EOS>
Jane
,
will
you
marry
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Still
I
did
not
answer
,
and
still
I
writhed
myself
from
his
grasp
:
for
I
was
still
incredulous
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
doubt
me
,
Jane
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Entirely
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
faith
in
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
a
whit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
a
liar
in
your
eyes
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
passionately
.
"
<EOS>
Little
sceptic
,
you
_
shall
_
be
convinced
.
<EOS>
What
love
have
I
for
Miss
Ingram
?
<EOS>
None
:
and
that
you
know
.
<EOS>
What
love
has
she
for
me
?
<EOS>
None
:
as
I
have
taken
pains
to
prove
<EOS>
:
I
caused
a
rumour
to
reach
her
that
my
fortune
was
not
a
third
of
what
was
supposed
,
and
after
that
I
presented
myself
to
see
the
result
;
it
was
coldness
both
from
her
and
her
mother
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
 
I
could
not
 
marry
Miss
Ingram
.
<EOS>
You
 
<EOS>
you
strange
<EOS>
,
you
almost
unearthly
thing
!
 
<EOS>
I
love
as
my
own
flesh
.
<EOS>
You
 
poor
and
obscure
,
and
small
and
plain
as
you
are
 
<EOS>
I
entreat
to
accept
me
as
a
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
me
!
<EOS>
"
I
ejaculated
,
beginning
in
his
earnestness
 
and
especially
in
his
incivility
 
to
credit
his
sincerity
:
"
me
who
have
not
a
friend
in
the
world
<EOS>
but
you
 
if
you
are
my
friend
:
not
a
shilling
but
what
you
have
given
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
Jane
,
I
must
have
you
for
my
own
 
entirely
my
own
.
<EOS>
Will
you
be
mine
?
<EOS>
Say
yes
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
,
let
me
look
at
your
face
:
turn
to
the
moonlight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
want
to
read
your
countenance
 
turn
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
you
will
find
it
scarcely
more
legible
than
a
crumpled
,
scratched
page
.
<EOS>
Read
on
:
only
make
haste
,
for
I
suffer
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
face
was
very
much
agitated
and
very
much
flushed
,
and
there
were
strong
workings
in
the
features
,
and
strange
gleams
in
the
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Jane
,
you
torture
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
With
that
searching
and
yet
faithful
and
generous
look
,
you
torture
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
do
that
?
<EOS>
If
you
are
true
,
and
your
offer
real
,
my
only
feelings
to
you
must
be
gratitude
and
devotion
 
they
can
not
torture
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gratitude
!
"
<EOS>
he
ejaculated
;
and
added
wildly
 
"
Jane
accept
me
quickly
.
<EOS>
Say
,
Edward
 
give
me
my
name
 
<EOS>
Edward
 
<EOS>
I
will
marry
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
in
earnest
?
<EOS>
Do
you
truly
love
me
?
<EOS>
Do
you
sincerely
wish
me
to
be
your
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
;
and
if
an
oath
is
necessary
to
satisfy
you
,
I
swear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
sir
,
I
will
marry
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Edward
 
my
little
wife
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Edward
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
to
me
 
come
to
me
entirely
now
,
"
said
he
;
and
added
,
in
his
deepest
tone
,
speaking
in
my
ear
as
his
cheek
was
laid
on
mine
,
"
Make
my
happiness
 
I
will
make
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
pardon
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
subjoined
ere
long
;
"
and
man
meddle
not
with
me
:
I
have
her
,
and
will
hold
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
one
to
meddle
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
kindred
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
 
that
is
the
best
of
it
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
And
if
I
had
loved
him
less
I
should
have
thought
his
accent
and
look
of
exultation
savage
;
but
,
sitting
by
him
,
roused
from
the
nightmare
of
parting
 
called
to
the
paradise
of
union
 
<EOS>
I
thought
only
of
the
bliss
given
me
to
drink
in
so
abundant
a
flow
.
<EOS>
Again
and
again
he
said
,
"
Are
you
happy
,
Jane
?
"
<EOS>
And
again
and
again
I
answered
,
"
Yes
.
"
<EOS>
After
which
he
murmured
,
"
It
will
atone
 
<EOS>
it
will
atone
.
<EOS>
Have
I
not
found
her
friendless
,
and
cold
,
and
comfortless
?
<EOS>
Will
I
not
guard
,
and
cherish
,
and
solace
her
?
<EOS>
Is
there
not
love
in
my
heart
,
and
constancy
in
my
resolves
?
<EOS>
It
will
expiate
at
God
's
tribunal
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
Maker
sanctions
what
I
do
.
<EOS>
For
the
world
's
judgment
 
I
wash
my
hands
thereof
.
<EOS>
For
man
's
opinion
 
I
defy
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
what
had
befallen
the
night
?
<EOS>
The
moon
was
not
yet
set
,
and
we
were
all
in
shadow
:
<EOS>
I
could
scarcely
see
my
master
's
face
,
near
as
I
was
.
<EOS>
And
what
ailed
the
chestnut
tree
?
<EOS>
it
writhed
and
groaned
;
while
wind
roared
in
the
laurel
walk
,
and
came
sweeping
over
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
go
in
,
"
said
Mr.
Rochester
:
"
the
weather
changes
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
sat
with
thee
till
morning
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
"
thought
I
,
"
could
I
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
said
so
,
perhaps
,
but
a
livid
,
vivid
spark
leapt
out
of
a
cloud
at
which
I
was
looking
,
and
there
was
a
crack
,
a
crash
,
and
a
close
rattling
peal
;
and
I
thought
only
of
hiding
my
dazzled
eyes
against
Mr.
Rochester
's
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
The
rain
rushed
down
.
<EOS>
He
hurried
me
up
the
walk
,
through
the
grounds
,
and
into
the
house
;
but
we
were
quite
wet
before
we
could
pass
the
threshold
.
<EOS>
He
was
taking
off
my
shawl
in
the
hall
,
and
shaking
the
water
out
of
my
loosened
hair
,
when
Mrs.
Fairfax
emerged
from
her
room
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
observe
her
at
first
,
nor
did
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
The
lamp
was
lit
.
<EOS>
The
clock
was
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hasten
to
take
off
your
wet
things
,
"
said
he
;
"
and
before
you
go
,
good-
night
 
<EOS>
good
-
night
,
my
darling
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
kissed
me
repeatedly
.
<EOS>
When
I
looked
up
,
on
leaving
his
arms
,
there
stood
the
widow
,
pale
,
grave
,
and
amazed
.
<EOS>
I
only
smiled
at
her
,
and
ran
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
Explanation
will
do
for
another
time
,
"
thought
I.
<EOS>
Still
,
when
I
reached
my
chamber
,
I
felt
a
pang
at
the
idea
she
should
even
temporarily
misconstrue
what
she
had
seen
.
<EOS>
But
joy
soon
effaced
every
other
feeling
;
and
loud
as
the
wind
blew
,
near
and
deep
as
the
thunder
crashed
,
fierce
and
frequent
as
the
lightning
gleamed
,
cataract
-
like
as
the
rain
fell
during
a
storm
of
two
hours
'
duration
,
I
experienced
no
fear
and
little
awe
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
came
thrice
to
my
door
in
the
course
of
it
,
to
ask
if
I
was
safe
and
tranquil
:
and
that
was
comfort
<EOS>
,
that
was
strength
for
anything
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
left
my
bed
in
the
morning
,
little
Adele
came
running
in
to
tell
me
that
the
great
horse
-
chestnut
at
the
bottom
of
the
orchard
had
been
struck
by
lightning
in
the
night
,
and
half
of
it
split
away
.
    
<EOS>
As
I
rose
and
dressed
,
I
thought
over
what
had
happened
,
and
wondered
if
it
were
a
dream
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
be
certain
of
the
reality
till
I
had
seen
Mr.
Rochester
again
,
and
heard
him
renew
his
words
of
love
and
promise
.
  
<EOS>
While
arranging
my
hair
,
I
looked
at
my
face
in
the
glass
,
and
felt
it
was
no
longer
plain
:
there
was
hope
in
its
aspect
and
life
in
its
colour
;
and
my
eyes
seemed
as
if
they
had
beheld
the
fount
of
fruition
,
and
borrowed
beams
from
the
lustrous
ripple
.
<EOS>
I
had
often
been
unwilling
to
look
at
my
master
,
because
I
feared
he
could
not
be
pleased
at
my
look
;
but
I
was
sure
I
might
lift
my
face
to
his
now
,
and
not
cool
his
affection
by
its
expression
.
<EOS>
I
took
a
plain
but
clean
and
light
summer
dress
from
my
drawer
and
put
it
on
:
it
seemed
no
attire
had
ever
so
well
become
me
,
because
none
had
I
ever
worn
in
so
blissful
a
mood
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
not
surprised
,
when
I
ran
down
into
the
hall
,
to
see
that
a
brilliant
June
morning
had
succeeded
to
the
tempest
of
the
night
;
and
to
feel
,
through
the
open
glass
door
,
the
breathing
of
a
fresh
and
fragrant
breeze
.
<EOS>
Nature
must
be
gladsome
when
I
was
so
happy
.
<EOS>
A
beggar
-
woman
and
her
little
boy
 
pale
,
ragged
objects
<EOS>
both
 
were
coming
up
the
walk
,
and
I
ran
down
and
gave
them
all
the
money
I
happened
to
have
in
my
purse
 
<EOS>
some
three
or
four
shillings
:
good
or
bad
,
they
must
partake
of
my
jubilee
.
<EOS>
The
rooks
cawed
,
and
blither
birds
sang
;
but
nothing
was
so
merry
or
so
musical
as
my
own
rejoicing
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
surprised
me
by
looking
out
of
the
window
with
a
sad
countenance
,
and
saying
gravely
 
"
Miss
Eyre
,
will
you
come
to
breakfast
?
"
<EOS>
During
the
meal
she
was
quiet
and
cool
:
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
undeceive
her
then
.
<EOS>
I
must
wait
for
my
master
to
give
explanations
;
and
so
must
she
.
<EOS>
I
ate
what
I
could
,
and
then
I
hastened
upstairs
.
<EOS>
I
met
Adele
leaving
the
schoolroom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
?
<EOS>
It
is
time
for
lessons
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rochester
has
sent
me
away
to
the
nursery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
there
,
"
pointing
to
the
apartment
she
had
left
;
and
I
went
in
,
and
there
he
stood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
and
bid
me
good
-
morning
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
I
gladly
advanced
;
and
it
was
not
merely
a
cold
word
now
,
or
even
a
shake
of
the
hand
that
I
received
,
but
an
embrace
and
a
kiss
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
natural
:
it
seemed
genial
to
be
so
well
loved
,
so
caressed
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
you
look
blooming
,
and
smiling
,
and
pretty
,
"
said
he
:
"
truly
pretty
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Is
this
my
pale
,
little
elf
?
<EOS>
Is
this
my
mustard-
seed
?
<EOS>
This
little
sunny
-
faced
girl
with
the
dimpled
cheek
and
rosy
lips
;
<EOS>
the
satin
-
smooth
hazel
hair
,
and
the
radiant
hazel
eyes
?
<EOS>
"
(
I
had
green
eyes
,
reader
;
but
you
must
excuse
the
mistake
:
for
him
they
were
new
-
dyed
,
I
suppose
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
Jane
Eyre
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Soon
to
be
Jane
Rochester
,
"
he
added
:
"
in
four
weeks
,
Janet
;
not
a
day
more
.
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
,
and
I
could
not
quite
comprehend
it
<EOS>
:
it
made
me
giddy
.
<EOS>
The
feeling
,
the
announcement
sent
through
me
,
was
something
stronger
than
was
consistent
with
joy
 
<EOS>
something
that
smote
and
stunned
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
I
think
almost
fear
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
blushed
,
and
now
you
are
white
,
Jane
<EOS>
:
what
is
that
for
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
you
gave
me
a
new
name
 
Jane
Rochester
;
and
it
seems
so
strange
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mrs.
Rochester
,
"
said
he
;
"
young
Mrs.
Rochester
 
Fairfax
Rochester
's
girl
-
bride
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
never
be
,
sir
;
it
does
not
sound
likely
.
<EOS>
Human
beings
never
enjoy
complete
happiness
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
born
for
a
different
destiny
to
the
rest
of
my
species
:
to
imagine
such
a
lot
befalling
me
is
a
fairy
tale
 
<EOS>
a
day
-
dream
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Which
I
can
and
will
realise
.
<EOS>
I
shall
begin
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
This
morning
I
wrote
to
my
banker
in
London
to
send
me
certain
jewels
he
has
in
his
keeping
,
 
heirlooms
for
the
ladies
of
Thornfield
.
<EOS>
In
a
day
or
two
I
hope
to
pour
them
into
your
lap
:
for
every
privilege
,
every
attention
shall
be
yours
that
I
would
accord
a
peer
's
daughter
,
if
about
to
marry
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir
!
 
never
rain
jewels
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
to
hear
them
spoken
of
.
<EOS>
Jewels
for
Jane
Eyre
sounds
unnatural
and
strange
:
I
would
rather
not
have
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
myself
put
the
diamond
chain
<EOS>
round
your
neck
,
and
the
circlet
on
your
forehead
,
 
which
it
will
become
:
<EOS>
for
nature
,
at
least
,
has
stamped
her
patent
of
nobility
on
this
brow
,
Jane
;
and
I
will
clasp
the
bracelets
on
these
fine
wrists
,
and
load
these
fairy
-
like
fingers
with
rings
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
no
,
sir
!
<EOS>
think
of
other
subjects
,
and
speak
of
other
things
,
and
in
another
strain
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
address
me
as
if
I
were
a
beauty
;
I
am
your
plain
,
Quakerish
governess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
beauty
in
my
eyes
,
and
a
beauty
just
after
the
desire
of
my
heart
,
 
delicate
and
aerial
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Puny
and
insignificant
,
you
mean
.
<EOS>
You
are
dreaming
,
sir
,
 
or
you
are
sneering
.
<EOS>
For
God
's
sake
do
n't
be
ironical
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
the
world
acknowledge
you
a
beauty
,
too
,
"
he
went
on
,
while
I
really
became
uneasy
at
the
strain
he
had
adopted
,
because
I
felt
he
was
either
deluding
himself
or
trying
to
delude
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
attire
my
Jane
in
satin
and
lace
,
and
she
shall
have
roses
in
her
hair
;
and
I
will
cover
the
head
I
love
best
with
a
priceless
veil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
you
wo
n't
know
me
,
sir
;
and
I
shall
not
be
your
Jane
Eyre
any
longer
,
but
an
ape
in
a
harlequin
's
jacket
 
a
jay
in
borrowed
plumes
.
<EOS>
I
would
as
soon
see
you
,
Mr.
Rochester
,
tricked
out
in
stage
-
trappings
,
as
myself
clad
in
a
court
-
lady
's
robe
;
and
I
do
n't
call
you
handsome
,
sir
,
though
I
love
you
most
dearly
:
far
too
dearly
to
flatter
you
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
flatter
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
pursued
his
theme
,
however
,
without
noticing
my
deprecation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
very
day
I
shall
take
you
in
the
carriage
to
Millcote
,
and
you
must
choose
some
dresses
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
we
shall
be
married
in
four
weeks
.
<EOS>
The
wedding
is
to
take
place
quietly
,
in
the
church
down
below
yonder
;
and
then
I
shall
waft
you
away
at
once
to
town
.
<EOS>
After
a
brief
stay
there
,
I
shall
bear
my
treasure
to
regions
nearer
the
sun
:
to
French
vineyards
and
Italian
plains
;
and
she
shall
see
whatever
is
famous
in
old
story
and
in
modern
record
:
she
shall
taste
,
too
,
of
the
life
of
cities
;
and
she
shall
learn
to
value
herself
by
just
comparison
with
others
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
travel
?
 
<EOS>
and
with
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
sojourn
at
Paris
,
Rome
,
and
Naples
:
at
Florence
,
Venice
,
and
Vienna
:
<EOS>
all
the
ground
I
have
wandered
over
shall
be
re
-
trodden
by
you
:
wherever
I
stamped
my
hoof
,
your
sylph
's
foot
shall
step
also
.
<EOS>
Ten
years
since
,
I
flew
through
Europe
half
mad
;
with
disgust
,
hate
,
and
rage
as
my
companions
:
now
I
shall
revisit
it
healed
and
cleansed
,
with
a
very
angel
as
my
comforter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
laughed
at
him
as
he
said
this
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
an
angel
,
"
I
asserted
;
"
and
I
will
not
be
one
till
I
die
:
I
will
be
myself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
,
you
must
neither
expect
nor
exact
anything
celestial
of
me
 
for
<EOS>
you
will
not
get
it
,
any
more
than
I
shall
get
it
of
you
:
which
I
do
not
at
all
anticipate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
anticipate
of
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
a
little
while
you
will
perhaps
be
as
you
are
now
,
 
a
very
little
while
;
and
then
you
will
turn
cool
;
and
then
you
will
be
capricious
;
and
then
you
will
be
stern
,
and
I
shall
have
much
ado
to
please
you
:
but
when
you
get
well
used
to
me
,
you
will
perhaps
like
me
again
,
 
_
<EOS>
like
_
me
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
not
<EOS>
_
love
<EOS>
_
me
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
your
love
will
effervesce
in
six
months
,
or
less
.
<EOS>
I
have
observed
in
books
written
by
men
,
that
period
assigned
as
the
farthest
to
which
a
husband
's
ardour
extends
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
after
all
,
as
a
friend
and
companion
,
I
hope
never
to
become
quite
distasteful
to
my
dear
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Distasteful
!
<EOS>
and
like
you
again
!
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
like
you
again
,
and
yet
again
:
and
I
will
make
you
confess
<EOS>
I
do
not
only
_
like
_
,
but
_
love
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
you
 
with
truth
,
fervour
,
constancy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
are
you
not
capricious
,
sir
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
women
who
please
me
only
by
their
faces
,
I
am
the
very
devil
when
I
find
out
they
have
neither
souls
nor
hearts
 
when
they
open
to
me
a
perspective
of
flatness
,
triviality
,
and
perhaps
imbecility
,
coarseness
,
and
ill
-
temper
:
but
to
the
clear
eye
and
eloquent
tongue
,
to
the
soul
made
of
fire
,
and
the
character
that
bends
but
does
not
break
 
at
once
supple
and
stable
,
tractable
and
consistent
 
<EOS>
I
am
ever
tender
and
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Had
you
ever
experience
of
such
a
character
,
sir
?
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
love
such
an
one
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
love
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
before
me
:
if
I
,
indeed
,
in
any
respect
come
up
to
your
difficult
standard
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
met
your
likeness
.
<EOS>
Jane
,
you
please
me
,
and
you
master
me
 
<EOS>
you
seem
to
submit
,
and
I
like
the
sense
of
pliancy
you
impart
;
and
while
I
am
twining
the
soft
,
silken
skein
round
my
finger
,
it
sends
a
thrill
up
my
arm
to
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
am
influenced
 
conquered
;
and
the
influence
is
sweeter
than
I
can
express
;
and
the
conquest
I
undergo
has
a
witchery
beyond
any
triumph
I
can
win
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
smile
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
What
does
that
inexplicable
,
that
uncanny
turn
of
countenance
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
thinking
,
sir
(
you
will
excuse
the
idea
;
it
was
involuntary
)
,
I
was
thinking
of
Hercules
and
Samson
with
their
charmers
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
were
,
you
little
elfish
 
"
  
"
Hush
,
sir
!
<EOS>
You
do
n't
talk
very
wisely
just
now
;
any
more
than
those
gentlemen
acted
very
wisely
.
<EOS>
However
,
had
they
been
married
,
they
would
no
doubt
by
their
severity
as
husbands
have
made
up
for
their
softness
as
suitors
;
and
so
will
you
,
I
fear
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
you
will
answer
me
a
year
hence
,
should
I
ask
a
favour
<EOS>
it
does
not
suit
your
convenience
or
pleasure
to
grant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
me
something
now
,
Jane
,
 
the
least
thing
:
<EOS>
I
desire
to
be
entreated
 
"
  
"
Indeed
I
will
,
sir
;
I
have
my
petition
all
ready
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
!
<EOS>
But
if
you
look
up
and
smile
with
that
countenance
,
I
shall
swear
concession
before
I
know
to
what
,
and
that
will
make
a
fool
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
sir
;
I
ask
only
this
:
do
n't
send
for
the
jewels
,
and
do
n't
crown
me
with
roses
:
<EOS>
you
might
as
well
put
a
border
of
gold
lace
<EOS>
round
that
plain
pocket
handkerchief
you
have
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
might
as
well
"
gild
refined
gold
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
:
your
request
is
granted
then
 
for
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
will
remand
the
order
I
despatched
to
my
banker
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
not
yet
asked
for
anything
;
you
have
prayed
a
gift
to
be
withdrawn
:
try
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
sir
,
have
the
goodness
to
gratify
my
curiosity
,
which
is
much
piqued
on
one
point
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
disturbed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
?
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
Curiosity
is
a
dangerous
petition
:
it
is
well
I
have
not
taken
a
vow
to
accord
every
request
 
"
  
"
But
there
can
be
no
danger
in
complying
with
this
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Utter
it
,
Jane
:
<EOS>
but
I
wish
that
instead
of
a
mere
inquiry
into
,
perhaps
,
a
secret
,
it
was
a
wish
for
half
my
estate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
King
Ahasuerus
!
<EOS>
What
do
I
want
with
half
your
estate
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
am
a
Jew
-
usurer
,
seeking
good
investment
in
land
?
<EOS>
I
would
much
rather
have
all
your
confidence
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
exclude
me
from
your
confidence
if
you
admit
me
to
your
heart
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
welcome
to
all
my
confidence
that
is
worth
having
,
Jane
;
but
for
God
's
sake
,
do
n't
desire
a
useless
burden
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
long
for
poison
 
do
n't
turn
out
a
downright
Eve
on
my
hands
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
,
sir
?
<EOS>
You
have
just
been
telling
me
how
much
you
liked
to
be
conquered
,
and
how
pleasant
over
-
persuasion
is
to
you
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
I
had
better
take
advantage
of
the
confession
,
and
begin
and
coax
and
entreat
 
even
cry
and
be
sulky
if
necessary
 
for
the
sake
of
a
mere
essay
of
my
power
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
you
to
any
such
experiment
.
<EOS>
Encroach
,
presume
,
and
<EOS>
the
game
is
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
,
sir
?
<EOS>
You
soon
give
in
.
<EOS>
How
stern
you
look
now
!
<EOS>
Your
eyebrows
have
become
as
thick
as
my
finger
,
and
your
forehead
resembles
what
,
in
some
very
astonishing
poetry
,
I
once
saw
styled
,
"
a
blue
-
piled
thunderloft
.
<EOS>
"
That
will
be
your
married
look
,
sir
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
If
that
will
be
_
<EOS>
your
_
married
look
,
<EOS>
I
,
as
a
Christian
,
will
soon
give
up
the
notion
of
consorting
with
a
mere
sprite
or
salamander
.
<EOS>
But
what
had
you
to
ask
,
thing
,
 
out
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
you
are
less
than
civil
now
;
and
I
like
rudeness
a
great
deal
better
than
flattery
.
<EOS>
I
had
rather
be
a
_
thing
_
than
an
angel
.
<EOS>
This
is
what
I
have
to
ask
,
 
Why
did
you
take
such
pains
to
make
me
believe
you
wished
to
marry
Miss
Ingram
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
<EOS>
Thank
God
it
is
no
worse
!
"
<EOS>
And
now
he
unknit
his
black
brows
;
looked
down
,
smiling
at
me
,
and
stroked
my
hair
,
as
if
well
pleased
at
seeing
a
danger
averted
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
may
confess
,
"
he
continued
,
"
even
although
I
should
make
you
a
little
indignant
,
Jane
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
seen
what
a
fire
-
spirit
you
can
be
when
you
are
indignant
.
<EOS>
You
glowed
in
the
cool
moonlight
last
night
,
when
you
mutinied
against
fate
,
and
claimed
your
rank
as
my
equal
.
<EOS>
Janet
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
it
was
you
who
made
me
the
offer
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
did
.
<EOS>
But
to
the
point
if
you
please
,
sir
 
Miss
Ingram
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
feigned
courtship
of
Miss
Ingram
,
because
I
wished
to
render
you
as
madly
in
love
with
me
as
I
was
with
you
;
and
I
knew
jealousy
would
be
the
best
ally
I
could
call
in
for
the
furtherance
of
that
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Excellent
!
<EOS>
Now
you
are
small
 
not
one
whit
bigger
than
the
end
of
my
little
finger
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
burning
shame
and
a
scandalous
disgrace
to
act
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
Did
you
think
nothing
of
Miss
Ingram
's
feelings
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
feelings
are
concentrated
in
one
 
pride
;
and
that
needs
humbling
.
<EOS>
Were
you
jealous
,
Jane
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
Mr.
Rochester
:
it
is
in
no
way
interesting
to
you
to
know
that
.
<EOS>
Answer
me
truly
once
more
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
Miss
Ingram
will
not
suffer
from
your
dishonest
coquetry
?
<EOS>
Wo
n't
she
feel
forsaken
and
deserted
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Impossible
!
 
<EOS>
when
I
told
you
how
she
,
on
the
contrary
,
deserted
me
:
the
idea
of
my
insolvency
cooled
,
or
rather
extinguished
,
her
flame
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
curious
,
designing
mind
,
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
your
principles
on
some
points
are
eccentric
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
principles
were
never
trained
,
Jane
:
they
may
have
grown
a
little
awry
for
want
of
attention
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Once
again
,
seriously
;
may
I
enjoy
the
great
good
that
has
been
vouchsafed
to
me
,
without
fearing
that
any
one
else
is
suffering
the
bitter
pain
I
myself
felt
a
while
ago
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
That
you
may
,
<EOS>
my
good
little
girl
:
there
is
not
another
being
in
the
world
<EOS>
has
the
same
pure
love
for
me
as
yourself
 
for
I
lay
that
pleasant
unction
to
my
soul
,
Jane
,
a
belief
in
your
affection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
turned
my
lips
to
the
hand
that
lay
on
my
shoulder
.
<EOS>
I
loved
him
very
much
 
more
than
I
could
trust
myself
to
say
 
more
than
words
had
power
to
express
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
something
more
,
"
he
said
presently
;
"
it
is
my
delight
to
be
entreated
,
and
to
yield
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
again
ready
with
my
request
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Communicate
your
intentions
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
sir
:
she
saw
me
with
you
last
night
in
the
hall
,
and
she
was
shocked
.
<EOS>
Give
her
some
explanation
before
I
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
It
pains
me
to
be
misjudged
by
so
good
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
to
your
room
,
and
put
on
your
bonnet
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
you
to
accompany
me
to
Millcote
this
morning
;
and
while
you
prepare
for
the
drive
,
I
will
enlighten
the
old
lady
's
understanding
.
<EOS>
Did
she
think
,
Janet
,
you
had
given
the
world
for
love
,
and
considered
it
well
lost
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
she
thought
I
had
forgotten
my
station
,
and
yours
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Station
!
station
!
 
<EOS>
your
station
is
in
my
heart
,
and
on
the
necks
of
those
who
would
insult
you
,
now
or
hereafter
.
 
<EOS>
Go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
soon
dressed
;
and
when
I
heard
Mr.
Rochester
quit
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
parlour
,
I
hurried
down
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
old
lady
,
had
been
reading
her
morning
portion
of
Scripture
 
the
Lesson
for
the
day
;
her
Bible
lay
open
before
her
,
and
her
spectacles
were
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Her
occupation
,
suspended
by
Mr.
Rochester
's
announcement
,
seemed
now
forgotten
:
<EOS>
her
eyes
,
fixed
on
the
blank
wall
opposite
,
expressed
the
surprise
of
a
quiet
mind
stirred
by
unwonted
tidings
.
<EOS>
Seeing
me
,
she
roused
herself
:
she
made
a
sort
of
effort
to
smile
,
and
framed
a
few
words
of
congratulation
;
but
the
smile
expired
,
and
the
sentence
was
abandoned
unfinished
.
<EOS>
She
put
up
her
spectacles
,
shut
the
Bible
,
and
pushed
her
chair
back
from
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
so
astonished
,
"
she
began
,
"
I
hardly
know
what
to
say
to
you
,
Miss
Eyre
.
<EOS>
I
have
surely
not
been
dreaming
,
have
I
?
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
half
fall
asleep
when
I
am
sitting
alone
and
fancy
things
that
have
never
happened
.
<EOS>
It
has
seemed
to
me
more
than
once
when
I
have
been
in
a
doze
,
that
my
dear
husband
,
who
died
fifteen
years
since
,
has
come
in
and
sat
down
beside
me
;
and
that
I
have
even
heard
him
call
me
by
my
name
,
Alice
,
as
he
used
to
do
.
<EOS>
Now
,
can
you
tell
me
whether
it
is
actually
true
that
Mr.
Rochester
has
asked
you
to
marry
him
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
laugh
at
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
really
thought
he
came
in
here
five
minutes
ago
,
and
said
that
in
a
month
you
would
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
said
the
same
thing
to
me
,
"
I
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
!
<EOS>
Do
you
believe
him
?
<EOS>
Have
you
accepted
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
at
me
bewildered
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
never
have
thought
it
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
proud
man
:
all
the
Rochesters
were
proud
:
and
his
father
,
at
least
,
liked
money
.
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
has
always
been
called
careful
.
<EOS>
He
means
to
marry
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
tells
me
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
surveyed
my
whole
person
:
in
her
eyes
I
read
<EOS>
that
they
had
there
found
no
charm
powerful
enough
to
solve
the
enigma
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
passes
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
continued
;
"
but
no
doubt
,
it
is
true
since
you
say
so
.
<EOS>
How
it
will
answer
,
I
can
not
tell
:
I
really
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
Equality
of
position
and
fortune
is
often
advisable
in
such
cases
;
and
there
are
twenty
years
of
difference
in
your
ages
.
<EOS>
He
might
almost
be
your
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
I
,
nettled
;
"
he
is
nothing
like
my
father
!
<EOS>
No
one
,
who
saw
us
together
,
would
suppose
it
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
looks
as
young
,
and
is
as
young
,
as
some
men
at
five
-
and-
twenty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
really
for
love
he
is
going
to
marry
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
so
hurt
by
her
coldness
and
scepticism
,
that
the
tears
rose
to
my
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
grieve
you
,
"
pursued
the
widow
;
"
but
you
are
so
young
,
and
so
little
acquainted
with
men
,
I
wished
to
put
you
on
your
guard
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
old
saying
that
"
all
is
not
gold
that
glitters
;
"
and
<EOS>
in
this
case
I
do
fear
there
will
be
something
found
to
be
different
to
what
either
you
or
I
expect
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
 
<EOS>
am
I
a
monster
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
:
"
is
it
impossible
that
Mr.
Rochester
should
have
a
sincere
affection
for
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
:
you
are
very
well
;
and
much
improved
of
late
;
and
Mr.
Rochester
,
I
daresay
,
is
fond
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
noticed
that
you
were
a
sort
of
pet
of
his
.
<EOS>
There
are
times
when
,
for
your
sake
,
I
have
been
a
little
uneasy
at
his
marked
preference
,
and
have
wished
to
put
you
on
your
guard
:
but
I
did
not
like
to
suggest
even
the
possibility
of
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
knew
such
an
idea
would
shock
,
perhaps
offend
you
;
and
you
were
so
discreet
,
and
so
thoroughly
modest
and
sensible
,
I
hoped
you
might
be
trusted
to
protect
yourself
.
<EOS>
Last
night
I
can
not
tell
you
what
I
suffered
when
I
sought
all
over
the
house
,
and
could
find
you
nowhere
,
nor
the
master
either
;
and
then
,
at
twelve
o'clock
,
saw
you
come
in
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
never
mind
that
now
,
"
I
interrupted
impatiently
;
"
it
is
enough
that
all
was
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
all
will
be
right
in
the
end
,
"
she
said
:
"
but
believe
me
,
you
can
not
be
too
careful
.
<EOS>
Try
and
keep
Mr.
Rochester
at
a
distance
:
distrust
yourself
as
well
as
him
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
in
his
station
are
not
accustomed
to
marry
their
governesses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
growing
truly
irritated
:
happily
,
Adele
ran
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
,
 
let
me
go
to
Millcote
too
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
wo
n't
:
though
there
is
so
much
room
in
the
new
carriage
.
<EOS>
Beg
him
to
let
me
go
mademoiselle
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
I
will
,
Adele
;
"
and
I
hastened
away
with
her
,
glad
to
quit
my
gloomy
monitress
.
<EOS>
The
carriage
was
ready
:
they
were
bringing
it
round
to
the
front
,
and
my
master
was
pacing
the
pavement
<EOS>
,
Pilot
following
him
backwards
and
forwards
.
  
<EOS>
"
Adele
may
accompany
us
,
<EOS>
may
she
not
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
her
no
.
<EOS>
I
'll
have
no
brats
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
have
only
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
let
her
go
,
Mr.
Rochester
,
if
you
please
:
it
would
be
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
it
<EOS>
:
she
will
be
a
restraint
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
quite
peremptory
,
both
in
look
and
voice
.
<EOS>
The
chill
of
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
warnings
,
and
the
damp
of
her
doubts
were
upon
me
:
<EOS>
something
of
unsubstantiality
and
uncertainty
had
beset
my
hopes
.
<EOS>
I
half
lost
the
sense
of
power
over
him
.
<EOS>
I
was
about
mechanically
to
obey
him
,
without
further
remonstrance
;
but
as
he
helped
me
into
the
carriage
,
he
looked
at
my
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
;
"
all
the
sunshine
is
gone
.
<EOS>
Do
you
really
wish
the
bairn
to
go
?
<EOS>
Will
it
annoy
you
if
she
is
left
behind
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
far
rather
she
went
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
off
for
your
bonnet
,
and
back
like
a
flash
of
lightning
!
"
cried
he
to
Adele
.
  
<EOS>
She
obeyed
him
with
what
speed
she
might
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
a
single
morning
's
interruption
will
not
matter
much
,
"
said
he
,
"
when
I
mean
shortly
to
claim
you
 
your
thoughts
,
conversation
,
and
company
 
for
life
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adele
,
when
lifted
in
,
commenced
kissing
me
,
by
way
of
expressing
her
gratitude
for
my
intercession
:
she
was
instantly
stowed
away
into
a
corner
on
the
other
side
of
him
.
<EOS>
She
then
peeped
round
to
where
I
sat
;
so
stern
a
neighbour
was
too
restrictive
to
him
,
in
his
present
fractious
mood
,
she
dared
whisper
no
observations
,
nor
ask
of
him
any
information
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
her
come
to
me
,
"
I
entreated
:
"
she
will
,
perhaps
,
trouble
you
,
sir
<EOS>
:
there
is
plenty
of
room
on
this
side
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
handed
her
over
as
if
she
had
been
a
lapdog
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
send
her
to
school
yet
,
"
he
said
,
but
now
he
was
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
Adele
heard
him
,
and
asked
if
she
was
to
go
to
school
<EOS>
"
sans
mademoiselle
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
replied
,
"
absolutely
sans
mademoiselle
;
for
I
am
to
take
mademoiselle
to
the
moon
,
and
there
I
shall
seek
a
cave
in
one
of
the
white
valleys
among
the
volcano
-
tops
,
and
mademoiselle
shall
live
with
me
there
,
and
only
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
have
nothing
to
eat
:
you
will
starve
her
,
"
observed
Adele
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
gather
manna
for
her
morning
and
night
:
the
plains
and
hillsides
in
the
moon
are
bleached
with
manna
,
Adele
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
want
to
warm
herself
:
what
will
she
do
for
a
fire
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fire
rises
out
of
the
lunar
mountains
:
when
she
is
cold
,
I
'll
carry
her
up
to
a
peak
,
and
lay
her
down
on
the
edge
of
a
crater
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
qu
'
elle
y
sera
mal
 
peu
comfortable
!
<EOS>
And
her
clothes
,
they
will
wear
out
:
how
can
she
get
new
ones
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
professed
to
be
puzzled
.
"
<EOS>
Hem
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
do
,
Adele
?
<EOS>
Cudgel
your
brains
for
an
expedient
.
<EOS>
How
would
a
white
or
a
pink
cloud
answer
for
a
gown
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
And
one
could
cut
a
pretty
enough
scarf
out
of
a
rainbow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
far
better
as
she
is
,
"
concluded
Adele
,
after
musing
some
time
:
"
besides
,
she
would
get
tired
of
living
with
only
you
in
the
moon
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
mademoiselle
,
I
would
never
consent
to
go
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
consented
:
she
has
pledged
her
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
ca
n't
get
her
there
;
there
is
no
road
to
the
moon
<EOS>
:
it
is
all
air
;
and
neither
you
nor
she
can
fly
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Adele
,
look
at
that
field
.
<EOS>
"
We
were
now
outside
Thornfield
gates
,
and
bowling
lightly
along
the
smooth
road
to
Millcote
,
where
the
dust
was
well
laid
by
the
thunderstorm
,
and
,
where
the
low
hedges
and
lofty
timber
trees
on
each
side
glistened
green
and
rain
-
refreshed
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
that
field
,
Adele
,
I
was
walking
late
one
evening
about
a
fortnight
since
 
the
evening
of
the
day
<EOS>
you
helped
me
to
make
hay
in
the
orchard
meadows
;
and
,
as
I
was
tired
with
raking
swaths
,
I
sat
down
to
rest
me
on
a
stile
;
and
there
I
took
out
a
little
book
and
a
pencil
,
and
began
to
write
about
a
misfortune
that
befell
me
long
ago
,
and
a
wish
I
had
for
happy
days
to
come
:
I
was
writing
away
very
fast
,
though
daylight
was
fading
from
the
leaf
,
when
something
came
up
the
path
and
stopped
two
yards
off
me
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
thing
with
a
veil
of
gossamer
on
its
head
.
<EOS>
I
beckoned
it
to
come
near
me
;
it
stood
soon
at
my
knee
.
<EOS>
I
never
spoke
to
it
,
and
it
never
spoke
to
me
,
in
words
;
but
I
read
its
eyes
,
and
it
read
mine
;
and
our
speechless
colloquy
was
to
this
effect
    
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
fairy
,
and
come
from
Elf
-
land
,
it
said
;
and
its
errand
was
to
make
me
happy
:
I
must
go
with
it
out
of
the
common
world
to
a
lonely
place
 
such
as
the
moon
,
for
instance
 
<EOS>
and
it
nodded
its
head
towards
her
horn
,
rising
over
Hay
-
hill
<EOS>
:
it
told
me
of
the
alabaster
cave
and
silver
vale
where
we
might
live
.
<EOS>
I
said
I
should
like
to
go
;
but
reminded
it
,
as
you
did
me
,
that
I
had
no
wings
to
fly
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Oh
,
"
returned
the
fairy
,
"
that
does
not
signify
!
<EOS>
Here
is
a
talisman
will
remove
all
difficulties
;
"
and
she
held
out
a
pretty
gold
ring
.
<EOS>
"
Put
it
,
"
she
said
,
"
on
the
fourth
finger
of
my
left
hand
,
and
I
am
yours
,
and
you
are
mine
;
and
we
shall
leave
earth
,
and
make
our
own
heaven
yonder
.
"
<EOS>
She
nodded
again
at
the
moon
.
<EOS>
The
ring
,
Adele
,
is
in
my
breeches
-
pocket
,
under
the
disguise
of
a
sovereign
:
but
I
mean
soon
to
change
it
to
a
ring
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
has
mademoiselle
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
for
the
fairy
<EOS>
:
you
said
it
was
mademoiselle
you
would
take
to
the
moon
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
is
a
fairy
,
"
he
said
,
whispering
mysteriously
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
I
told
her
not
to
mind
his
badinage
;
and
she
,
on
her
part
,
evinced
a
fund
of
genuine
French
scepticism
:
denominating
Mr.
Rochester
"
un
vrai
menteur
,
"
and
assuring
him
that
she
made
no
account
whatever
of
his
"
contes
de
fee
,
"
and
that
"
du
reste
,
il
n'y
avait
pas
de
fees
,
et
quand
<EOS>
meme
il
y
<EOS>
en
<EOS>
avait
<EOS>
:
"
she
was
sure
they
would
never
appear
to
him
,
nor
ever
give
him
rings
,
or
offer
to
live
with
him
in
the
moon
.
  
<EOS>
The
hour
spent
at
Millcote
was
a
somewhat
harassing
one
to
me
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
obliged
me
to
go
to
a
certain
silk
warehouse
:
there
I
was
ordered
to
choose
half
-
a
-
dozen
dresses
.
<EOS>
I
hated
the
business
,
I
begged
leave
to
defer
it
:
no
 
it
should
be
gone
through
with
now
.
<EOS>
By
dint
of
entreaties
expressed
in
energetic
whispers
,
I
reduced
the
half
-
dozen
to
two
:
these
however
,
he
vowed
he
would
select
himself
.
<EOS>
With
anxiety
I
watched
his
eye
rove
over
the
gay
stores
:
he
fixed
on
a
rich
silk
of
the
most
brilliant
amethyst
dye
,
and
a
superb
pink
satin
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
in
a
new
series
of
whispers
,
that
he
might
as
well
buy
me
a
gold
gown
and
a
silver
bonnet
at
once
<EOS>
:
I
should
certainly
never
venture
to
wear
his
choice
.
<EOS>
With
infinite
difficulty
,
for
he
was
stubborn
as
a
stone
,
I
persuaded
him
to
make
an
exchange
in
favour
of
a
sober
black
satin
and
pearl
-
grey
silk
.
<EOS>
"
It
might
pass
for
the
present
,
"
he
said
;
"
but
he
would
yet
see
me
glittering
like
a
parterre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Glad
was
I
to
get
him
out
of
the
silk
warehouse
,
and
then
out
of
a
jewellers
shop
:
the
more
he
bought
me
,
the
more
my
cheek
burned
with
a
sense
of
annoyance
and
degradation
.
<EOS>
As
we
re
-
entered
the
carriage
,
and
I
sat
back
feverish
and
fagged
<EOS>
,
I
remembered
what
,
in
the
hurry
of
events
,
dark
and
bright
,
I
had
wholly
forgotten
 
the
letter
of
my
uncle
,
John
Eyre
,
to
Mrs.
Reed
:
his
intention
to
adopt
me
and
make
me
his
legatee
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
,
indeed
,
be
a
relief
,
"
I
thought
,
"
if
I
had
ever
so
small
an
independency
;
I
never
can
bear
being
dressed
like
a
doll
by
Mr.
Rochester
,
or
sitting
like
a
second
Danae
with
the
golden
shower
falling
daily
round
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
write
to
Madeira
the
moment
I
get
home
,
and
tell
my
uncle
John
I
am
going
to
be
married
,
and
to
whom
:
if
I
had
but
a
prospect
of
one
day
bringing
Mr.
Rochester
an
accession
of
fortune
,
I
could
better
endure
to
be
kept
by
him
now
.
"
<EOS>
And
somewhat
relieved
by
this
idea
(
which
I
failed
not
to
execute
that
day
)
,
I
ventured
once
more
to
meet
my
master
's
and
lover
's
eye
,
which
most
pertinaciously
sought
mine
,
though
I
averted
both
face
and
gaze
.
<EOS>
He
smiled
;
and
I
thought
his
smile
was
such
as
a
sultan
might
,
in
a
blissful
and
fond
moment
,
bestow
on
a
slave
his
gold
and
gems
had
enriched
<EOS>
:
I
crushed
his
hand
,
which
was
ever
hunting
mine
,
vigorously
,
and
thrust
it
back
to
him
red
with
the
passionate
pressure
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
look
in
that
way
,
"
I
said
;
"
if
you
do
,
I
'll
wear
nothing
<EOS>
but
my
old
Lowood
frocks
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
.
<EOS>
I
'll
be
married
in
this
lilac
<EOS>
gingham
<EOS>
:
you
may
make
a
dressing
-
gown
for
yourself
out
of
the
pearl
-
grey
silk
,
and
an
infinite
series
of
waistcoats
out
of
the
black
satin
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
chuckled
;
he
rubbed
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
is
rich
to
see
and
hear
her
?
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
Is
she
original
?
<EOS>
Is
she
piquant
?
<EOS>
I

this

girl

Grand
Turk

gazelle-
eyes
,
houri
forms

all

<EOS>
The
Eastern
allusion
bit
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
stand
you
an
inch
in
the
stead
of
a
seraglio
,
"
I
said
;
"
so
do
n't
consider
me
an
equivalent
for
one
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
a
fancy
for
anything
in
that
line
,
away
with
you
,
sir
,
to
the
bazaars
of
Stamboul
without
delay
,
and
lay
out
in
extensive
slave-
purchases
some
of
that
spare
cash
you
seem
at
a
loss
to
spend
satisfactorily
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
will
you
do
,
Janet
,
while
I
am
bargaining
for
so
many
tons
of
flesh
and
such
an
assortment
of
black
eyes
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
preparing
myself
to
go
out
as
a
missionary
to
preach
liberty
to
them
that
are
enslaved
 
your
harem
inmates
amongst
the
rest
.
<EOS>
I
'll
get
admitted
there
,
and
I
'll
stir
up
mutiny
;
and
you
,
three
-
tailed
bashaw
as
you
are
,
sir
,
shall
in
a
trice
find
yourself
fettered
amongst
our
hands
:
nor
will
I
,
for
one
,
consent
to
cut
your
bonds
till
you
have
signed
a
charter
,
the
most
liberal
that
despot
ever
yet
conferred
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
consent
to
be
at
your
mercy
,
Jane

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
no
mercy
,
Mr.
Rochester
,
if
you
supplicated
for
it
with
an
eye
like
that
.
<EOS>
While
you
looked
so
,
I
should
be
certain
that
whatever
charter
you
might
grant
under
coercion
,
your
first
act
,
when
released
,
would
be
to
violate
its
conditions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Jane
,
what
would
you
have
?
<EOS>
I
fear
you
will
compel
me
to
go
through
a
private
marriage
ceremony
,
besides
that
performed
at
the
altar
.
<EOS>
You
will
stipulate
,
I
see
,
for
peculiar
terms
 
<EOS>
what
will
they
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
want
an
easy
mind
,
sir
;
not
crushed
by
crowded
obligations
.
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
what
you
said
of
Celine
Varens
?
 
of
the
diamonds
,
the
cashmeres
you
gave
her
?
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
your
English
Celine
Varens
.
<EOS>
I
shall
continue
to
act
as
Adele
's
governess
;
by
that
I
shall
earn
my
board
and
lodging
,
and
thirty
pounds
a
year
besides
.
<EOS>
I
'll
furnish
my
own
wardrobe
out
of
that
money

and
you
shall
give
me
nothing
but
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
regard
;
and
if
I
give
you
mine
in
return
,
that
debt
will
be
quit

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well

for
cool
native
impudence
and
pure
innate
pride
,
you
have
n't
your
equal

"
said
he
.
<EOS>
We
were
now
approaching
Thornfield
.
<EOS>
"
Will
it
please
you
to
dine
with
me
to

day

<EOS>
"
he
asked
,
as
we
re
-
entered
the
gates
.
  
<EOS>
"
No

you

sir

"
  
<EOS>

And
what
for
,
"
no
,
thank
you

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
if
one
may
inquire

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never

no

I
should
now
:

"
Till
what
?
<EOS>
You
delight
in
half
-
phrases
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Till
I
ca
n't
help
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
suppose
I
eat
like
an
ogre
or
a
ghoul
,
that
you
dread
being
the
companion
of
my
repast
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
formed
no
supposition
on
the
subject
,
sir
;
but
I
want
to
go
on
as
usual
for
another
month

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
give
up
your
governessing
slavery
at
once

<EOS>
"
  
"
Indeed
,
begging
your
pardon
,
sir
,
I
shall
not
.
<EOS>
I
shall
just
go
on
with
it
as
usual
.
<EOS>
I
shall
keep
out
of
your
way
all
day
,
as
I
have
been
accustomed
to
do
:
you
may
send
for
me
in
the
evening
,
when
you
feel
disposed
to
see
me
,
and
I
'll
come
then
;
but
at
no
other
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
a
smoke
,
Jane
,
or
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
to
comfort
me
under
all
this
,
"
pour
me
donner
une
contenance
,
"
as
Adele
would
say
;
and
unfortunately
I
have
neither
my
cigar
-
case
,
nor
my
snuff
-
box
.
<EOS>
But
listen
 
whisper
.
<EOS>
It
is
your
time
now
,
little
tyrant
,
but
it
will
be
mine
presently
;
and
when
once
I
have
fairly
seized
you
,
to
have
and
to
hold
,
I
'll
just
 
figuratively
speaking
 
attach
you
to
a
chain
like
this
"
(
touching
his
watch
-
guard
)
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
bonny
wee
thing
,
I
'll
wear
you
in
my
bosom
,
lest
my
jewel
<EOS>
I
should
tyne
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
said
this
as
he
helped
me
to
alight
from
the
carriage
,
and
while
he
afterwards
lifted
out
Adele
,
I
entered
the
house
,
and
made
good
my
retreat
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
He
duly
summoned
me
to
his
presence
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
I
had
prepared
an
occupation
for
him
;
for
I
was
determined
not
to
spend
the
whole
time
in
a
_
tete
-
a
-
tete
_
conversation
.
<EOS>
I
remembered
his
fine
voice
;
I
knew
he
liked
to
sing
 
good
singers
generally
do
.
<EOS>
I
was
no
vocalist
myself
,
and
,
in
his
fastidious
judgment
,
no
musician
,
either
;
but
I
delighted
in
listening
when
the
performance
was
good
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
twilight
,
that
hour
of
romance
,
began
to
lower
her
blue
and
starry
banner
over
the
lattice
,
than
I
rose
,
opened
the
piano
,
and
entreated
him
,
for
the
love
of
heaven
,
to
give
me
a
song
.
<EOS>
He
said
I
was
a
capricious
witch
,
and
that
he
would
rather
sing
another
time
;
but
I
averred
that
no
time
was
like
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
like
his
voice
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
much
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
fond
of
pampering
that
susceptible
vanity
of
his
;
but
for
once
,
and
from
motives
of
expediency
,
I
would
e'en
soothe
and
stimulate
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Jane
,
you
must
play
the
accompaniment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
sir
,
I
will
try
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
try
,
but
was
presently
swept
off
the
stool
and
denominated
"
a
little
bungler
.
<EOS>
"
Being
pushed
unceremoniously
to
one
side
 
which
was
precisely
what
I
wished
 
<EOS>
he
usurped
my
place
,
and
proceeded
to
accompany
himself
:
for
he
could
play
as
well
as
sing
.
<EOS>
I
hied
me
to
the
window
-
recess
.
<EOS>
And
while
I
sat
there
and
looked
out
on
the
still
trees
and
dim
lawn
,
to
a
sweet
air
was
sung
in
mellow
tones
the
following
strain
:
    
"
<EOS>
The
truest
love
that
ever
heart
Felt
at
its
kindled
core
,
Did
through
each
vein
,
in
quickened
start
,
The
tide
of
being
pour
.
  
<EOS>
Her
coming
was
my
hope
<EOS>
each
day
,
Her
parting
was
my
pain
;
The
chance
that
did
her
steps
delay
Was
ice
in
every
vein
.
  
<EOS>
I
dreamed
it
would
be
nameless
bliss
,
As
I
loved
,
loved
to
be
;
And
to
this
object
did
I
press
As
blind
as
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
But
wide
as
pathless
was
the
space
That
lay
our
lives
between
,
And
dangerous
as
the
foamy
race
Of
ocean
-
surges
green
.
  
<EOS>
And
haunted
as
a
robber
-
path
Through
wilderness
or
wood
;
For
Might
and
Right
,
and
Woe
and
Wrath
,
Between
our
spirits
stood
.
  
<EOS>
I
dangers
dared
;
I
hindrance
scorned
;
I
omens
did
defy
<EOS>
:
Whatever
menaced
,
harassed
,
warned
,
I
passed
impetuous
by
.
  
<EOS>
On
sped
my
rainbow
,
fast
as
light
;
I
flew
as
in
a
dream
;
For
glorious
rose
upon
my
sight
<EOS>
That
child
of
Shower
and
Gleam
.
  
<EOS>
Still
bright
on
clouds
of
suffering
dim
Shines
that
soft
,
solemn
joy
;
Nor
care
I
now
,
how
dense
and
grim
Disasters
gather
nigh
.
  
<EOS>
I
care
not
in
this
moment
sweet
,
<EOS>
Though
all
I
have
rushed
o'er
Should
come
on
pinion
,
strong
and
fleet
,
Proclaiming
vengeance
sore
:
  
<EOS>
Though
haughty
Hate
should
strike
me
down
,
Right
,
bar
approach
to
me
,
And
grinding
Might
,
with
furious
frown
,
Swear
endless
enmity
.
  
<EOS>
My
love
has
placed
her
little
hand
With
noble
faith
in
mine
,
And
vowed
that
wedlock
's
sacred
band
Our
nature
shall
entwine
.
  
<EOS>
My
love
has
sworn
,
with
sealing
kiss
,
With
me
to
live
 
to
die
;
I
have
at
last
my
nameless
bliss
.
<EOS>
As
I
love
 
loved
am
I
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
rose
and
came
towards
me
,
and
I
saw
his
face
all
kindled
,
and
his
full
falcon
-
eye
flashing
,
and
tenderness
and
passion
in
every
lineament
.
<EOS>
I
quailed
momentarily
 
then
I
rallied
.
<EOS>
Soft
scene
,
daring
demonstration
,
I
would
not
have
;
and
I
stood
in
peril
of
both
:
<EOS>
a
weapon
of
defence
must
be
prepared
 
<EOS>
I
whetted
my
tongue
:
as
he
reached
me
,
I
asked
with
asperity
,
"
whom
he
was
going
to
marry
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
a
strange
question
to
be
put
by
his
darling
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
I
considered
it
a
very
natural
and
necessary
one
:
he
had
talked
of
his
future
wife
dying
with
him
.
<EOS>
What
did
he
mean
by
such
a
pagan
idea
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
had
no
intention
of
dying
with
him
 
he
might
depend
on
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
all
he
longed
,
all
he
prayed
for
,
was
that
I
might
live
with
him
!
<EOS>
Death
was
not
for
such
as
I.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
it
was
:
<EOS>
I
had
as
good
a
right
to
die
when
my
time
came
as
he
had
:
<EOS>
but
I
should
bide
that
time
,
and
not
be
hurried
away
in
a
suttee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
I
forgive
him
for
the
selfish
idea
,
and
prove
my
pardon
by
a
reconciling
kiss
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
:
I
would
rather
be
excused
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
I
heard
myself
apostrophised
as
a
"
hard
little
thing
;
"
and
it
was
added
,
"
any
other
woman
would
have
been
melted
to
marrow
at
hearing
such
stanzas
crooned
in
her
praise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
assured
him
I
was
naturally
hard
 
very
flinty
,
and
that
he
would
often
find
me
so
;
and
that
,
moreover
,
I
was
determined
to
show
him
divers
rugged
points
in
my
character
before
the
ensuing
four
weeks
elapsed
:
he
should
know
fully
what
sort
of
a
bargain
he
had
made
,
while
there
was
yet
time
to
rescind
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
I
be
quiet
and
talk
rationally
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
be
quiet
if
he
liked
,
and
as
to
talking
rationally
,
I
flattered
myself
I
was
doing
that
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
fretted
,
pished
,
and
pshawed
.
"
<EOS>
Very
good
,
"
I
thought
;
"
you
may
fume
and
fidget
as
you
please
:
but
this
is
the
best
plan
to
pursue
with
you
<EOS>
,
I
am
certain
.
<EOS>
I
like
you
more
than
I
can
say
;
but
I
'll
not
sink
into
a
bathos
of
sentiment
:
and
with
this
needle
of
repartee
I
'll
keep
you
from
the
edge
of
the
gulf
too
;
and
,
moreover
,
maintain
by
its
pungent
aid
that
distance
between
you
and
myself
most
conducive
to
our
real
mutual
advantage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
From
less
to
more
,
I
worked
him
up
to
considerable
irritation
;
then
,
after
he
had
retired
,
in
dudgeon
,
quite
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
I
got
up
,
and
saying
,
"
I
wish
you
good
-
night
,
sir
,
"
in
my
natural
and
wonted
respectful
manner
,
I
slipped
out
by
the
side
-
door
and
got
away
.
  
<EOS>
The
system
thus
entered
on
,
I
pursued
during
the
whole
season
of
probation
;
and
with
the
best
success
.
<EOS>
He
was
kept
,
to
be
sure
,
rather
cross
and
crusty
;
but
on
the
whole
I
could
see
he
was
excellently
entertained
,
and
that
a
lamb
-
like
submission
and
turtle
-
dove
sensibility
,
while
fostering
his
despotism
more
,
would
have
pleased
his
judgment
,
satisfied
his
common
-
sense
,
and
even
suited
his
taste
less
.
  
<EOS>
In
other
people
's
presence
I
was
,
as
formerly
,
deferential
and
quiet
;
any
other
line
of
conduct
being
uncalled
for
:
it
was
only
in
the
evening
conferences
I
thus
thwarted
and
afflicted
him
.
<EOS>
He
continued
to
send
for
me
punctually
the
moment
the
clock
struck
seven
;
though
when
I
appeared
before
him
now
,
he
had
no
such
honeyed
terms
as
"
love
"
and
"
darling
"
on
his
lips
:
the
best
words
at
my
service
were
"
provoking
puppet
,
"
"
malicious
elf
,
"
"
sprite
,
"
"
changeling
,
"
&
c.
<EOS>
For
caresses
,
too
,
I
now
got
grimaces
;
for
a
pressure
of
the
hand
,
a
pinch
on
the
arm
;
for
a
kiss
on
the
cheek
,
a
severe
tweak
of
the
ear
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
right
:
at
present
I
decidedly
preferred
these
fierce
favours
to
anything
more
tender
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
I
saw
,
approved
me
:
her
anxiety
on
my
account
vanished
;
therefore
I
was
certain
I
did
well
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
Mr.
Rochester
affirmed
I
was
wearing
him
to
skin
and
bone
,
and
threatened
awful
vengeance
for
my
present
conduct
at
some
period
fast
coming
.
<EOS>
I
laughed
in
my
sleeve
at
his
menaces
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
keep
you
in
reasonable
check
now
,
"
I
reflected
;
"
and
I
do
n't
doubt
to
be
able
to
do
it
hereafter
:
if
one
expedient
loses
its
virtue
,
another
must
be
devised
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Yet
after
all
my
task
was
not
an
easy
one
;
often
I
would
rather
have
pleased
than
teased
him
.
<EOS>
My
future
husband
was
becoming
to
me
my
whole
world
;
and
more
than
the
world
:
almost
my
hope
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
He
stood
between
me
and
every
thought
of
religion
,
as
an
eclipse
intervenes
between
man
and
the
broad
sun
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
,
in
those
days
,
see
God
for
His
creature
:
of
whom
I
had
made
an
idol
.
    
<EOS>
The
month
of
courtship
had
wasted
:
its
very
last
hours
were
being
numbered
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
putting
off
the
day
that
advanced
 
the
bridal
day
;
and
all
preparations
for
its
arrival
were
complete
.
<EOS>
_
I
_
,
at
least
,
had
nothing
more
to
do
:
there
were
my
trunks
,
packed
,
locked
,
corded
,
ranged
in
a
row
along
the
wall
of
my
little
chamber
;
to
-
morrow
,
at
this
time
,
they
would
be
far
on
their
road
to
London
:
<EOS>
and
so
should
<EOS>
I
(
D.V.
)
,
 
or
rather
,
not
I
,
but
one
Jane
Rochester
,
a
person
whom
<EOS>
as
<EOS>
yet
I
knew
not
.
<EOS>
The
cards
of
address
alone
remained
to
nail
on
:
they
lay
,
four
little
squares
,
in
the
drawer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
had
himself
written
the
direction
,
"
Mrs.
Rochester
,
 
Hotel
,
London
,
"
on
each
:
I
could
not
persuade
myself
to
affix
them
,
or
to
have
them
affixed
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rochester
!
<EOS>
She
did
not
exist
:
she
would
not
be
born
till
to
-
morrow
,
some
time
after
eight
o'clock
a.m.
;
and
I
would
wait
to
be
assured
she
had
come
into
the
world
alive
before
I
assigned
to
her
all
that
property
.
<EOS>
It
was
enough
that
in
yonder
closet
,
opposite
my
dressing
-
table
,
garments
said
to
be
hers
had
already
displaced
my
black
stuff
<EOS>
Lowood
frock
and
straw
bonnet
:
for
not
to
me
appertained
that
suit
of
wedding
raiment
;
the
pearl
-
coloured
robe
,
the
vapoury
veil
pendent
from
the
usurped
portmanteau
.
<EOS>
I
shut
the
closet
to
conceal
the
strange
,
wraith
-
like
apparel
it
contained
;
which
,
at
this
evening
hour
 
nine
o'clock
 
gave
out
certainly
a
most
ghostly
shimmer
through
the
shadow
of
my
apartment
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
leave
you
by
yourself
,
white
dream
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
feverish
:
I
hear
the
wind
blowing
:
I
will
go
out
of
doors
and
feel
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
only
the
hurry
of
preparation
that
made
me
feverish
;
not
only
the
anticipation
of
the
great
change
 
the
new
life
which
was
to
commence
to
-
morrow
:
both
these
circumstances
had
their
share
,
doubtless
,
in
producing
that
restless
,
excited
mood
which
hurried
me
forth
at
this
late
hour
into
the
darkening
grounds
:
but
a
third
cause
influenced
my
mind
more
than
they
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
at
heart
a
strange
and
anxious
thought
.
<EOS>
Something
had
happened
which
I
could
not
comprehend
;
no
one
knew
of
or
had
seen
the
event
but
myself
:
it
had
taken
place
the
preceding
night
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
that
night
was
absent
from
home
;
nor
was
he
yet
returned
:
business
had
called
him
to
a
small
estate
of
two
or
three
farms
he
possessed
thirty
miles
off
 
business
<EOS>
it
was
requisite
he
should
settle
in
person
,
previous
to
his
meditated
departure
from
England
.
<EOS>
I
waited
now
his
return
;
eager
to
disburthen
my
mind
,
and
to
seek
of
him
the
solution
of
the
enigma
that
perplexed
me
.
<EOS>
Stay
till
he
comes
,
reader
;
and
,
when
I
disclose
my
secret
to
him
,
you
shall
share
the
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
I
sought
the
orchard
,
driven
to
its
shelter
by
the
wind
,
which
all
day
had
blown
strong
and
full
from
the
south
,
without
,
however
,
bringing
a
speck
of
rain
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
subsiding
as
night
drew
on
,
it
seemed
to
augment
its
rush
and
deepen
its
roar
:
the
trees
blew
steadfastly
one
way
,
never
writhing
round
,
and
scarcely
tossing
back
their
boughs
once
in
an
hour
;
so
continuous
was
the
strain
bending
their
branchy
heads
northward
 
<EOS>
the
clouds
drifted
from
pole
to
pole
,
fast
following
,
mass
on
mass
:
<EOS>
no
glimpse
of
blue
sky
had
been
visible
that
July
day
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
without
a
certain
wild
pleasure
<EOS>
I
ran
before
the
wind
,
delivering
my
trouble
of
mind
to
the
measureless
air
-
torrent
thundering
through
space
.
<EOS>
Descending
the
laurel
walk
,
I
faced
the
wreck
of
the
chestnut
-
tree
;
it
stood
up
black
and
riven
:
<EOS>
the
trunk
,
split
down
the
centre
,
gasped
ghastly
.
<EOS>
The
cloven
halves
were
not
broken
from
each
other
,
for
the
firm
base
and
strong
roots
kept
them
unsundered
below
;
though
community
of
vitality
was
destroyed
 
<EOS>
the
sap
could
flow
no
more
:
their
great
boughs
on
each
side
were
dead
,
and
next
winter
's
tempests
would
be
sure
to
fell
one
or
both
to
earth
:
as
yet
,
however
,
they
might
be
said
to
form
one
tree
 
a
ruin
,
but
an
entire
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
right
to
hold
fast
to
each
other
,
"
I
said
:
as
if
the
monster-
splinters
were
living
things
,
and
could
hear
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
scathed
as
you
look
,
and
charred
and
scorched
,
there
must
be
a
little
sense
of
life
in
you
yet
,
rising
out
of
that
adhesion
at
the
faithful
,
honest
roots
:
you
will
never
have
green
leaves
<EOS>
more
 
never
more
see
birds
making
nests
and
singing
idyls
in
your
boughs
;
the
time
of
pleasure
and
love
is
over
with
you
:
but
you
are
not
desolate
:
<EOS>
each
of
you
has
a
comrade
to
sympathise
with
him
in
his
decay
.
<EOS>
"
As
I
looked
up
at
them
,
the
moon
appeared
momentarily
in
that
part
of
the
sky
which
filled
their
fissure
;
her
disk
was
blood
-
red
and
half
overcast
;
she
seemed
to
throw
on
me
one
bewildered
,
dreary
glance
,
and
buried
herself
again
instantly
in
the
deep
drift
of
cloud
.
<EOS>
The
wind
fell
,
for
a
second
,
round
Thornfield
;
but
far
away
over
wood
and
water
,
poured
a
wild
,
melancholy
wail
<EOS>
:
it
was
sad
to
listen
to
,
and
I
ran
off
again
.
  
<EOS>
Here
<EOS>
and
there
I
strayed
through
the
orchard
,
gathered
up
the
apples
with
which
the
grass
round
the
tree
roots
was
thickly
strewn
;
then
I
employed
myself
in
dividing
the
ripe
from
the
unripe
;
I
carried
them
into
the
house
and
put
them
away
in
the
store
-
room
.
<EOS>
Then
I
repaired
to
the
library
to
ascertain
whether
the
fire
was
lit
,
for
,
though
summer
,
I
knew
on
such
a
gloomy
evening
Mr.
Rochester
would
like
to
see
a
cheerful
hearth
when
he
came
in
:
<EOS>
yes
,
the
fire
had
been
kindled
some
time
,
and
burnt
well
.
<EOS>
I
placed
his
arm
-
chair
by
the
chimney
-
corner
:
<EOS>
I
wheeled
the
table
near
it
:
I
let
down
the
curtain
,
and
had
the
candles
brought
in
ready
for
lighting
.
<EOS>
More
restless
than
ever
,
when
I
had
completed
these
arrangements
I
could
not
sit
still
,
nor
even
remain
in
the
house
:
a
little
time
-
piece
in
the
room
and
the
old
clock
in
the
hall
simultaneously
struck
ten
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
late
it
grows
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
run
down
to
the
gates
:
it
is
moonlight
at
intervals
;
I
can
see
a
good
way
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
coming
now
,
and
to
meet
him
will
save
some
minutes
of
suspense
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
wind
roared
high
in
the
great
trees
which
embowered
the
gates
;
but
the
road
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
to
the
right
hand
and
the
left
,
was
all
still
and
solitary
:
save
for
the
shadows
of
clouds
crossing
it
at
intervals
as
the
moon
looked
out
,
it
was
but
a
long
pale
line
,
unvaried
by
one
moving
speck
.
  
<EOS>
A
puerile
tear
dimmed
my
eye
while
I
looked
 
a
tear
of
disappointment
and
impatience
;
ashamed
of
it
,
I
wiped
it
away
.
<EOS>
I
lingered
;
the
moon
shut
herself
wholly
within
her
chamber
,
and
drew
close
her
curtain
of
dense
cloud
:
the
night
grew
dark
;
rain
came
driving
fast
on
the
gale
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
would
come
!
<EOS>
I
wish
he
would
come
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
,
seized
with
hypochondriac
foreboding
.
<EOS>
I
had
expected
his
arrival
before
tea
;
now
it
was
dark
:
what
could
keep
him
?
<EOS>
Had
an
accident
happened
?
<EOS>
The
event
of
last
night
again
recurred
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
interpreted
it
as
a
warning
of
disaster
.
<EOS>
I
feared
my
hopes
were
too
bright
to
be
realised
;
and
I
had
enjoyed
so
much
bliss
lately
<EOS>
that
I
imagined
my
fortune
had
passed
its
meridian
,
and
must
now
decline
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
can
not
return
to
the
house
,
"
I
thought
;
"
I
can
not
sit
by
the
fireside
,
while
he
is
abroad
in
inclement
weather
:
better
tire
my
limbs
than
strain
my
heart
;
I
will
go
forward
and
meet
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
set
out
;
I
walked
fast
,
but
not
far
:
ere
I
had
measured
a
quarter
of
a
mile
<EOS>
,
I
heard
the
tramp
of
hoofs
;
a
horseman
came
on
,
full
gallop
;
a
dog
ran
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
Away
with
evil
presentiment
!
<EOS>
It
was
he
:
here
he
was
,
mounted
on
Mesrour
,
followed
by
Pilot
.
<EOS>
He
saw
me
;
for
the
moon
had
opened
a
blue
field
in
the
sky
,
and
rode
in
it
watery
bright
:
he
took
his
hat
off
,
and
waved
it
round
his
head
.
<EOS>
I
now
ran
to
meet
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
he
exclaimed
,
as
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
bent
from
the
saddle
:
"
You
ca
n't
do
without
me
,
that
is
evident
.
<EOS>
Step
on
my
boot
-
toe
;
give
me
both
hands
:
mount
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
obeyed
:
joy
made
me
agile
<EOS>
:
I
sprang
up
before
him
.
<EOS>
A
hearty
kissing
I
got
for
a
welcome
,
and
some
boastful
triumph
,
which
I
swallowed
as
well
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
He
checked
himself
in
his
exultation
to
demand
,
"
But
is
there
anything
the
matter
,
Janet
,
that
you
come
to
meet
me
at
such
an
hour
?
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
wrong
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
<EOS>
but
I
thought
you
would
never
come
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
to
wait
in
the
house
for
you
,
especially
with
this
rain
and
wind
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Rain
and
wind
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
you
are
dripping
like
a
mermaid
;
pull
my
cloak
round
you
:
<EOS>
but
I
think
you
are
feverish
,
Jane
:
both
your
cheek
and
hand
are
burning
hot
.
<EOS>
I
ask
again
,
is
there
anything
the
matter
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nothing
now
;
I
am
neither
afraid
nor
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
have
been
both
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Rather
:
but
I
'll
tell
you
all
about
it
by
-
and
-
bye
,
sir
;
and
I
daresay
you
will
only
laugh
at
me
for
my
pains
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
laugh
at
you
heartily
when
to
-
morrow
is
past
;
till
then
I
dare
not
:
my
prize
is
not
certain
.
<EOS>
This
is
you
,
who
have
been
as
slippery
as
an
eel
this
last
month
,
and
as
thorny
as
a
briar
-
rose
?
<EOS>
I
could
not
lay
a
finger
anywhere
<EOS>
but
I
was
pricked
;
and
now
I
seem
to
have
gathered
up
a
stray
lamb
in
my
arms
.
<EOS>
You
wandered
out
of
the
fold
to
seek
your
shepherd
,
did
you
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wanted
you
:
but
do
n't
boast
.
<EOS>
Here
we
are
at
Thornfield
:
now
let
me
get
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
landed
me
on
the
pavement
.
<EOS>
As
John
took
his
horse
,
and
he
followed
me
into
the
hall
,
he
told
me
to
make
haste
and
put
something
dry
on
,
and
then
return
to
him
in
the
library
;
and
he
stopped
me
,
as
I
made
for
the
staircase
,
to
extort
a
promise
that
I
would
not
be
long
:
nor
was
I
long
;
in
five
minutes
I
rejoined
him
.
<EOS>
I
found
him
at
supper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
a
seat
and
bear
me
company
,
Jane
:
please
God
,
it
is
the
last
meal
but
one
you
will
eat
at
Thornfield
Hall
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
sat
down
near
him
,
but
told
him
I
could
not
eat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
it
because
you
have
the
prospect
of
a
journey
before
you
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
Is
it
the
thoughts
of
going
to
London
that
takes
away
your
appetite
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
see
my
prospects
clearly
to
-
night
,
sir
;
and
I
hardly
know
what
thoughts
I
have
in
my
head
.
<EOS>
Everything
in
life
seems
unreal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Except
me
:
I
am
substantial
enough
 
touch
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
sir
,
are
the
most
phantom
-
like
of
all
:
you
are
a
mere
dream
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
held
out
his
hand
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
Is
that
a
dream
?
"
said
he
,
placing
it
close
to
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
rounded
,
muscular
,
and
vigorous
hand
,
as
well
as
a
long
,
strong
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
though
I
touch
it
,
it
is
a
dream
,
"
said
I
,
as
I
put
it
down
from
before
my
face
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
have
you
finished
supper
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Jane
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
away
the
tray
.
<EOS>
When
we
were
again
alone
,
I
stirred
the
fire
,
and
then
took
a
low
seat
at
my
master
's
knee
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
near
midnight
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
:
but
remember
,
Jane
,
you
promised
to
wake
with
me
the
night
before
my
wedding
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
;
and
I
will
keep
my
promise
,
for
an
hour
or
two
at
least
:
<EOS>
I
have
no
wish
to
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
all
your
arrangements
complete
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
,
sir
.
"
  
"
And
on
my
part
likewise
,
"
he
returned
,
"
I
have
settled
everything
;
and
we
shall
leave
Thornfield
to
-
morrow
,
within
half
-
an
-
hour
after
our
return
from
church
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
With
what
an
extraordinary
smile
you
uttered
that
word
 
"
very
well
,
"
Jane
!
<EOS>
What
a
bright
spot
of
colour
you
have
on
each
cheek
!
<EOS>
and
how
strangely
your
eyes
glitter
!
<EOS>
Are
you
well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
am
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Believe
!
<EOS>
What
is
the
matter
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
what
you
feel
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
,
sir
:
no
words
could
tell
you
what
I
feel
.
<EOS>
I
wish
this
present
hour
would
never
end
:
who
knows
with
what
fate
the
next
may
come
charged
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
hypochondria
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
over
-
excited
,
or
over
-
fatigued
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
,
sir
,
feel
calm
and
happy
?
"
  
"
Calm
?
 
<EOS>
no
:
<EOS>
but
happy
 
to
the
heart
's
core
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
looked
up
at
him
to
read
the
signs
of
bliss
in
his
face
:
it
was
ardent
and
flushed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
your
confidence
,
Jane
,
"
he
said
:
"
relieve
your
mind
of
any
weight
that
oppresses
it
,
by
imparting
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
fear
?
 
<EOS>
that
I
shall
not
prove
a
good
husband
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
idea
farthest
from
my
thoughts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
apprehensive
of
the
new
sphere
you
are
about
to
enter
?
 
<EOS>
of
the
new
life
into
which
you
are
passing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
puzzle
me
,
Jane
:
<EOS>
your
look
and
tone
of
sorrowful
audacity
perplex
and
pain
me
.
<EOS>
I
want
an
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
sir
,
listen
.
<EOS>
You
were
from
home
last
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
:
I
know
that
;
and
you
hinted
a
while
ago
at
something
which
had
happened
in
my
absence
:
 
nothing
,
probably
,
of
consequence
;
but
,
in
short
,
it
has
disturbed
you
.
<EOS>
Let
me
hear
it
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
has
said
something
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
or
you
have
overheard
the
servants
talk
?
 
<EOS>
your
sensitive
self
-
respect
has
been
wounded
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
It
struck
twelve
 
<EOS>
I
waited
<EOS>
till
the
time
-
piece
had
concluded
its
silver
chime
,
and
the
clock
its
hoarse
,
vibrating
stroke
,
and
then
I
proceeded
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
day
yesterday
I
was
very
busy
,
and
very
happy
in
my
ceaseless
bustle
;
for
I
am
not
,
as
you
seem
to
think
,
troubled
by
any
haunting
fears
about
the
new
sphere
<EOS>
,
et
cetera
:
I
think
it
a
glorious
thing
to
have
the
hope
of
living
with
you
,
because
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
do
n't
caress
me
now
 
<EOS>
let
me
talk
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
I
trusted
well
in
Providence
,
and
believed
that
events
were
working
together
for
your
good
and
mine
:
it
was
a
fine
day
,
if
you
recollect
 
the
calmness
of
the
air
and
sky
forbade
apprehensions
respecting
your
safety
or
comfort
on
your
journey
.
<EOS>
I
walked
a
little
while
on
the
pavement
after
tea
,
thinking
of
you
;
and
I
beheld
you
in
imagination
so
near
me
,
I
scarcely
missed
your
actual
presence
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
the
life
that
lay
before
me
 
_
<EOS>
your
_
life
,
sir
 
<EOS>
an
existence
more
expansive
and
stirring
than
my
own
:
as
much
more
so
as
the
depths
of
the
sea
to
which
the
brook
runs
are
than
the
shallows
of
its
own
strait
channel
.
<EOS>
I
wondered
why
moralists
call
this
world
a
dreary
wilderness
:
for
me
it
blossomed
like
a
rose
.
<EOS>
Just
at
sunset
,
the
air
turned
cold
and
the
sky
cloudy
:
<EOS>
I
went
in
,
Sophie
called
me
upstairs
to
look
at
my
wedding
-
dress
,
which
they
had
just
brought
;
and
under
it
in
the
box
<EOS>
I
found
your
present
 
<EOS>
the
veil
which
,
in
your
princely
extravagance
,
you
sent
for
from
London
:
resolved
,
I
suppose
,
since
I
would
not
have
jewels
,
to
cheat
me
into
accepting
something
as
costly
.
<EOS>
I
smiled
as
I
unfolded
it
,
and
devised
how
I
would
tease
you
about
your
aristocratic
tastes
,
and
your
efforts
to
masque
your
plebeian
bride
in
the
attributes
of
a
peeress
.
<EOS>
I
thought
how
I
would
carry
down
to
you
the
square
of
unembroidered
blond
I
had
myself
prepared
as
a
covering
for
my
low
-
born
head
,
and
ask
if
that
was
not
good
enough
for
a
woman
who
could
bring
her
husband
neither
fortune
,
beauty
,
nor
connections
.
<EOS>
I
saw
plainly
how
you
would
look
;
and
heard
your
impetuous
republican
answers
,
and
your
haughty
disavowal
of
any
necessity
on
your
part
to
augment
your
wealth
,
or
elevate
your
standing
,
by
marrying
either
a
purse
or
a
coronet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
well
you
read
me
,
you
witch
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Mr.
Rochester
:
"
but
what
did
you
find
in
the
veil
besides
its
embroidery
?
<EOS>
Did
you
find
poison
,
or
a
dagger
,
that
you
look
so
mournful
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
sir
;
besides
the
delicacy
and
richness
of
the
fabric
,
I
found
nothing
save
Fairfax
Rochester
's
pride
;
and
that
did
not
scare
me
,
because
I
am
used
to
the
sight
of
the
demon
.
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
as
it
grew
dark
,
the
wind
rose
:
<EOS>
it
blew
yesterday
evening
,
not
as
it
blows
now
 
wild
and
high
 
but
"
with
a
sullen
,
moaning
sound
"
far
more
eerie
.
<EOS>
I
wished
you
were
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
came
into
this
room
,
and
the
sight
of
the
empty
chair
and
fireless
hearth
chilled
me
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
after
I
went
to
bed
,
I
could
not
sleep
 
a
sense
of
anxious
excitement
distressed
me
.
<EOS>
The
gale
still
rising
,
seemed
to
my
ear
to
muffle
a
mournful
under
-
sound
;
whether
in
the
house
or
abroad
I
could
not
at
first
tell
,
but
it
recurred
,
doubtful
yet
doleful
at
every
lull
;
at
last
I
made
out
it
must
be
some
dog
howling
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
I
was
glad
when
it
ceased
.
<EOS>
On
sleeping
,
I
continued
in
dreams
the
idea
of
a
dark
and
gusty
night
.
<EOS>
I
continued
also
the
wish
to
be
with
you
,
and
experienced
a
strange
,
regretful
consciousness
of
some
barrier
dividing
us
.
<EOS>
During
all
my
first
sleep
,
I
was
following
the
windings
of
an
unknown
road
;
total
obscurity
environed
me
;
rain
pelted
me
;
I
was
burdened
with
the
charge
of
a
little
child
:
a
very
small
creature
,
too
young
and
feeble
to
walk
,
and
which
shivered
in
my
cold
arms
,
and
wailed
piteously
in
my
ear
.
<EOS>
I
thought
,
sir
,
that
you
were
on
the
road
a
long
way
before
me
;
and
I
strained
every
nerve
to
overtake
you
,
and
made
effort
on
effort
to
utter
your
name
and
entreat
you
to
stop
 
but
my
movements
were
fettered
,
and
my
voice
still
died
away
inarticulate
;
while
you
,
I
felt
,
withdrew
farther
and
farther
every
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
these
dreams
weigh
on
your
spirits
now
,
Jane
,
when
I
am
close
to
you
?
<EOS>
Little
nervous
subject
!
<EOS>
Forget
visionary
woe
,
and
think
only
of
real
happiness
!
<EOS>
You
say
you
love
me
,
Janet
:
yes
 
I
will
not
forget
that
;
and
you
can
not
deny
it
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Those
_
words
did
not
die
inarticulate
on
your
lips
.
<EOS>
I
heard
them
clear
and
soft
:
a
thought
too
solemn
perhaps
,
but
sweet
as
music
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
a
glorious
thing
to
have
the
hope
of
living
with
you
,
Edward
,
because
I
love
you
.
"
<EOS>
Do
you
love
me
,
Jane
?
 
<EOS>
repeat
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
sir
 
<EOS>
I
do
,
with
my
whole
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
he
said
,
after
some
minutes
'
silence
,
"
it
is
strange
;
but
that
sentence
has
penetrated
my
breast
painfully
.
<EOS>
Why
?
<EOS>
I
think
because
you
said
it
with
such
an
earnest
,
religious
energy
,
and
because
your
upward
gaze
at
me
now
is
the
very
sublime
of
faith
,
truth
,
and
devotion
:
it
is
too
much
as
if
some
spirit
were
near
me
.
<EOS>
Look
wicked
,
Jane
:
as
you
know
well
how
to
look
:
coin
one
of
your
wild
,
shy
,
provoking
smiles
;
tell
me
you
hate
me
 
<EOS>
tease
me
,
vex
me
;
do
anything
but
move
me
:
<EOS>
I
would
rather
be
incensed
than
saddened
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
will
tease
you
and
vex
you
to
your
heart
's
content
,
when
I
have
finished
my
tale
:
but
hear
me
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
Jane
,
you
had
told
me
all
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
had
found
the
source
of
your
melancholy
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
.
<EOS>
"
What
!
is
there
more
?
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
believe
it
to
be
anything
important
.
<EOS>
I
warn
you
of
incredulity
beforehand
.
<EOS>
Go
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
disquietude
of
his
air
,
the
somewhat
apprehensive
impatience
of
his
manner
,
surprised
me
:
but
I
proceeded
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dreamt
another
dream
,
sir
:
that
Thornfield
Hall
was
a
dreary
ruin
,
the
retreat
of
bats
and
owls
.
<EOS>
I
thought
that
of
all
the
stately
front
nothing
remained
but
a
shell
-
like
wall
,
very
high
and
very
fragile
-
looking
.
<EOS>
I
wandered
,
on
a
moonlight
night
,
through
the
grass-
grown
enclosure
within
:
here
I
stumbled
over
a
marble
hearth
,
and
there
over
a
fallen
fragment
of
cornice
.
<EOS>
Wrapped
up
in
a
shawl
,
I
still
carried
the
unknown
little
child
:
I
might
not
lay
it
down
anywhere
,
however
tired
were
my
arms
 
however
much
its
weight
impeded
my
progress
,
I
must
retain
it
.
<EOS>
I
heard
the
gallop
of
a
horse
at
a
distance
on
the
road
;
I
was
sure
it
was
you
;
and
you
were
departing
for
many
years
and
for
a
distant
country
.
<EOS>
I
climbed
the
thin
wall
with
frantic
perilous
haste
,
eager
to
catch
one
glimpse
of
you
from
the
top
:
the
stones
rolled
from
under
my
feet
,
the
ivy
branches
I
grasped
gave
way
,
the
child
clung
round
my
neck
in
terror
,
and
almost
strangled
me
;
at
last
I
gained
the
summit
.
<EOS>
I
saw
you
like
a
speck
on
a
white
track
,
lessening
every
moment
.
<EOS>
The
blast
blew
so
strong
I
could
not
stand
.
<EOS>
I
sat
down
on
the
narrow
ledge
;
I
hushed
the
scared
infant
in
my
lap
:
<EOS>
you
turned
an
angle
of
the
road
:
I
bent
forward
to
take
a
last
look
;
the
wall
crumbled
;
I
was
shaken
;
the
child
rolled
from
my
knee
,
I
lost
my
balance
,
fell
,
and
woke
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Jane
,
that
is
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
the
preface
,
sir
;
the
tale
is
yet
to
come
.
<EOS>
On
waking
,
a
gleam
dazzled
my
eyes
;
I
thought
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
it
is
daylight
!
<EOS>
But
I
was
mistaken
;
it
was
only
candlelight
.
<EOS>
Sophie
,
I
supposed
,
had
come
in
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
light
in
the
dressing
-
table
,
and
the
door
of
the
closet
,
where
,
before
going
to
bed
,
I
had
hung
my
wedding
-
dress
and
veil
,
stood
open
;
I
heard
a
rustling
there
.
<EOS>
I
asked
,
"
Sophie
,
what
are
you
doing
?
"
<EOS>
No
one
answered
;
but
a
form
emerged
from
the
closet
;
it
took
the
light
,
held
it
aloft
,
and
surveyed
the
garments
pendent
from
the
portmanteau
.
"
<EOS>
Sophie
!
<EOS>
Sophie
!
<EOS>
"
I
again
cried
:
and
still
it
was
silent
.
<EOS>
I
had
risen
up
in
bed
,
I
bent
forward
:
first
surprise
,
then
bewilderment
,
came
over
me
;
and
then
my
blood
crept
cold
through
my
veins
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
,
this
was
not
Sophie
,
it
was
not
Leah
,
it
was
not
Mrs.
Fairfax
:
<EOS>
it
was
not
 
no
,
<EOS>
I
was
sure
of
it
,
and
am
still
 
<EOS>
it
was
not
even
that
strange
woman
,
Grace
Poole
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
must
have
been
one
of
them
,
"
interrupted
my
master
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
I
solemnly
assure
you
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
The
shape
standing
before
me
had
never
crossed
my
eyes
within
the
precincts
of
Thornfield
Hall
before
;
the
height
,
the
contour
were
new
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Describe
it
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seemed
,
sir
,
a
woman
,
tall
and
large
,
with
thick
and
dark
hair
hanging
long
down
her
back
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
dress
she
had
on
<EOS>
:
it
was
white
and
straight
;
but
whether
gown
,
sheet
,
or
shroud
,
I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
see
her
face
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
at
first
.
<EOS>
But
presently
she
took
my
veil
from
its
place
;
she
held
it
up
,
gazed
at
it
long
,
and
then
she
threw
it
over
her
own
head
,
and
turned
to
the
mirror
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
I
saw
the
reflection
of
the
visage
and
features
quite
distinctly
in
the
dark
oblong
glass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
were
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fearful
and
ghastly
to
me
 
<EOS>
oh
,
sir
,
I
never
saw
a
face
like
it
!
<EOS>
It
was
a
discoloured
face
 
<EOS>
it
was
a
savage
face
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
forget
the
roll
of
the
red
eyes
and
the
fearful
blackened
inflation
of
the
lineaments
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ghosts
are
usually
pale
,
Jane
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
,
sir
,
was
purple
:
the
lips
were
swelled
and
dark
;
the
brow
furrowed
:
the
black
eyebrows
widely
raised
over
the
bloodshot
eyes
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you
of
what
it
reminded
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Of
the
foul
German
spectre
 
the
Vampyre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
what
did
it
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
it
removed
my
veil
from
its
gaunt
head
,
rent
it
in
two
parts
,
and
flinging
both
on
the
floor
,
trampled
on
them
.

<EOS>
{
It

"
Afterwards
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
drew
aside
the
window
-
curtain
and
looked
out
;
perhaps
it
saw
dawn
approaching
,
for
,
taking
the
candle
,
it
retreated
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
Just
at
my
bedside
,
the
figure
stopped
:
the
fiery
eyes
glared
upon
me
 
<EOS>
she
thrust
up
her
candle
close
to
my
face
,
and
extinguished
it
under
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
was
aware
her
lurid
visage
flamed
over
mine
,
and
I
lost
consciousness
:
for
the
second
time
in
my
life
 
only
the
second
time
 
<EOS>
I
became
insensible
from
terror
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
was
with
you
when
you
revived
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
one
,
sir
,
but
the
broad
day
.
<EOS>
I
rose
,
bathed
my
head
and
face
in
water
,
drank
a
long
draught
;
felt
that
though
enfeebled
I
was
not
ill
,
and
determined
that
to
none
<EOS>
but
you
would
I
impart
this
vision
.
<EOS>
Now
,
sir
,
tell
me
who
and
what
that
woman
was
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
creature
of
an
over
-
stimulated
brain
;
that
is
certain
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
careful
of
you
,
my
treasure
:
nerves
like
yours
were
not
made
for
rough
handling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
depend
on
it
,
my
nerves
were
not
in
fault
;
the
thing
was
real
:
the
transaction
actually
took
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
your
previous
dreams
,
were
they
real
too
?
<EOS>
Is
Thornfield
Hall
a
ruin
?
<EOS>
Am
I
severed
from
you
by
insuperable
obstacles
?
<EOS>
Am
I
leaving
you
without
a
tear
 
without
a
kiss
 
without
a
word
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Am
I
about
to
do
it
?
<EOS>
Why
,
the
day
is
already
commenced
which
is
to
bind
us
indissolubly
;
and
when
we
are
once
united
,
there
shall
be
no
recurrence
of
these
mental
terrors
<EOS>
:
I
guarantee
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mental
terrors
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
believe
them
to
be
only
such
:
I
wish
it
more
now
than
ever
;
since
even
you
can
not
explain
to
me
the
mystery
of
that
awful
visitant
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
since
I
can
not
do
it
,
Jane
,
it
must
have
been
unreal
.
"
  
"
But
,
sir
,
when
I
said
so
to
myself
on
rising
this
morning
,
and
when
I
looked
round
the
room
to
gather
courage
and
comfort
from
the
cheerful
aspect
of
each
familiar
object
in
full
daylight
,
there
 
on
the
carpet
 
<EOS>
I
saw
what
gave
the
distinct
lie
to
my
hypothesis
,
 
the
veil
,
torn
from
top
to
bottom
in
two
halves
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
felt
Mr.
Rochester
start
and
shudder
;
he
hastily
flung
his
arms
round
me
.
"
<EOS>
Thank
God
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
"
that
if
anything
malignant
did
come
near
you
last
night
,
it
was
only
the
veil
that
was
harmed
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
to
think
what
might
have
happened
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
drew
his
breath
short
,
and
strained
me
so
close
to
him
,
I
could
scarcely
pant
.
<EOS>
After
some
minutes
'
silence
,
he
continued
,
cheerily
    
"
Now
,
Janet
,
I
'll
explain
to
you
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
half
dream
,
half
reality
.
<EOS>
A
woman
did
,
I
doubt
not
,
enter
your
room
:
and
that
woman
was
 
must
have
been
 
Grace
Poole
.
<EOS>
You
call
her
a
strange
being
yourself
:
from
all
you
know
,
you
have
reason
so
to
call
her
 
<EOS>
what
did
she
do
to
me
?
<EOS>
what
to
Mason
?
<EOS>
In
a
state
between
sleeping
and
waking
,
you
noticed
her
entrance
and
her
actions
;
but
feverish
,
almost
delirious
as
you
were
,
you
ascribed
to
her
a
goblin
appearance
different
from
her
own
:
the
long
dishevelled
hair
,
the
swelled
black
face
,
the
exaggerated
stature
,
were
figments
of
imagination
;
results
of
nightmare
:
the
spiteful
tearing
of
the
veil
was
real
:
and
it
is
like
her
.
<EOS>
I
see
you
would
ask
why
I
keep
such
a
woman
in
my
house
:
when
we
have
been
married
a
year
and
a
day
,
I
will
tell
you
;
but
not
now
.
<EOS>
Are
you
satisfied
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
Do
you
accept
my
solution
of
the
mystery
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
reflected
,
and
in
truth
it
appeared
to
me
the
only
possible
one
:
<EOS>
satisfied
<EOS>
I
was
not
,
but
to
please
him
I
endeavoured
to
appear
so
 
relieved
,
I
certainly
did
feel
;
so
I
answered
him
with
a
contented
smile
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
as
it
was
long
past
one
,
I
prepared
to
leave
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
not
Sophie
sleep
with
Adele
in
the
nursery
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
as
I
lit
my
candle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
there
is
room
enough
in
Adele
's
little
bed
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
share
it
with
her
to
-
night
,
Jane
:
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
incident
you
have
related
should
make
you
nervous
,
and
I
would
rather
you
did
not
sleep
alone
:
promise
me
to
go
to
the
nursery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
do
so
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
fasten
the
door
securely
on
the
inside
.
<EOS>
Wake
Sophie
when
you
go
upstairs
,
under
pretence
of
requesting
her
to
rouse
you
in
good
time
<EOS>
to-
morrow
;
for
you
must
be
dressed
and
have
finished
breakfast
before
eight
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
no
more
sombre
thoughts
:
chase
dull
care
away
,
Janet
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
hear
to
what
soft
whispers
the
wind
has
fallen
?
<EOS>
and
there
is
no
more
beating
of
rain
against
the
window
-
panes
:
<EOS>
look
here
"
(
he
lifted
up
the
curtain
)
 
<EOS>
"
it
is
a
lovely
night
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
.
<EOS>
Half
heaven
was
pure
and
stainless
:
<EOS>
the
clouds
,
now
trooping
before
the
wind
,
which
had
shifted
to
the
west
,
were
filing
off
eastward
in
long
,
silvered
columns
.
<EOS>
The
moon
shone
peacefully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr.
Rochester
,
gazing
inquiringly
into
my
eyes
,
"
how
is
my
Janet
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
night
is
serene
,
sir
;
and
so
am
I.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
you
will
not
dream
of
separation
and
sorrow
to
-
night
;
but
of
happy
love
and
blissful
union
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
prediction
was
but
half
fulfilled
:
I
did
not
indeed
dream
of
sorrow
,
but
as
little
did
I
dream
of
joy
;
for
I
never
slept
at
all
.
<EOS>
With
little
Adele
in
my
arms
,
I
watched
the
slumber
of
childhood
 
so
tranquil
,
so
passionless
,
so
innocent
 
and
waited
for
the
coming
day
:
all
my
life
was
awake
and
astir
in
my
frame
:
<EOS>
and
as
soon
as
the
sun
rose
I
rose
too
.
<EOS>
I
remember
Adele
clung
to
me
as
I
left
her
<EOS>
:
I
remember
I
kissed
her
as
I
loosened
her
little
hands
from
my
neck
;
and
I
cried
over
her
with
strange
emotion
,
and
quitted
her
because
I
feared
my
sobs
would
break
her
still
sound
repose
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
the
emblem
of
my
past
life
;
and
here
I
was
now
to
array
myself
to
meet
,
the
dread
,
but
adored
,
type
of
my
unknown
future
day
.
    
<EOS>
Sophie
came
at
seven
to
dress
me
:
she
was
very
long
indeed
in
accomplishing
her
task
;
so
long
that
Mr.
Rochester
,
grown
,
I
suppose
,
impatient
of
my
delay
,
sent
up
to
ask
why
I
did
not
come
.
<EOS>
She
was
just
fastening
my
veil
(
the
plain
square
of
blond
after
all
)
to
my
hair
with
a
brooch
;
I
hurried
from
under
her
hands
as
soon
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
in
French
.
<EOS>
"
Look
at
yourself
in
the
mirror
:
you
have
not
taken
one
peep
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
I
turned
at
the
door
:
I
saw
a
robed
and
veiled
figure
,
so
unlike
my
usual
self
that
it
seemed
almost
the
image
of
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
Jane
!
"
called
a
voice
,
and
I
hastened
down
.
<EOS>
I
was
received
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
by
Mr.
Rochester
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lingerer
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
my
brain
is
on
fire
with
impatience
,
and
you
tarry
so
long
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
me
into
the
dining
-
room
,
surveyed
me
keenly
all
over
,
pronounced
me
"
fair
as
a
lily
,
and
not
only
the
pride
of
his
life
,
but
the
desire
of
his
eyes
,
"
and
then
telling
me
he
would
give
me
but
ten
minutes
to
eat
some
breakfast
,
he
rang
the
bell
.
<EOS>
One
of
his
lately
hired
servants
,
a
footman
,
answered
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
John
getting
the
carriage
ready
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
the
luggage
brought
down
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
bringing
it
down
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
you
to
the
church
:
see
if
Mr.
Wood
(
the
clergyman
)
and
the
clerk
are
there
:
return
and
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
church
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
was
but
just
beyond
the
gates
;
the
footman
soon
returned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wood
is
in
the
vestry
,
sir
,
putting
on
his
surplice
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
the
carriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
horses
are
harnessing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
want
it
to
go
to
church
;
but
it
must
be
ready
<EOS>
the
moment
we
return
:
all
the
boxes
and
luggage
arranged
and
strapped
on
,
and
the
coachman
in
his
seat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
are
you
ready
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
rose
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
groomsmen
,
no
bridesmaids
,
no
relatives
to
wait
for
or
marshal
:
none
but
Mr.
Rochester
and
I.
Mrs.
Fairfax
stood
in
the
hall
as
we
passed
.
<EOS>
I
would
fain
have
spoken
to
her
,
but
my
hand
was
held
by
a
grasp
of
iron
:
I
was
hurried
along
by
a
stride
I
could
hardly
follow
;
and
to
look
at
Mr.
Rochester
's
face
was
to
feel
that
not
a
second
of
delay
would
be
tolerated
for
any
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
other
bridegroom
ever
looked
as
he
did
 
so
bent
up
to
a
purpose
,
so
grimly
resolute
:
or
who
,
under
such
steadfast
brows
,
ever
revealed
such
flaming
and
flashing
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
the
day
was
fair
or
foul
;
in
descending
the
drive
,
I
gazed
neither
on
sky
nor
earth
:
my
heart
was
with
my
eyes
;
and
both
seemed
migrated
into
Mr.
Rochester
's
frame
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
see
the
invisible
thing
on
which
,
as
we
went
along
,
he
appeared
to
fasten
a
glance
fierce
and
fell
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
feel
the
thoughts
whose
force
he
seemed
breasting
and
resisting
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
churchyard
wicket
he
stopped
:
he
discovered
I
was
quite
out
of
breath
.
"
<EOS>
Am
I
cruel
in
my
love
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Delay
an
instant
:
<EOS>
lean
on
me
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
now
I
can
recall
the
picture
of
the
grey
old
house
of
God
rising
calm
before
me
,
of
a
rook
wheeling
round
the
steeple
,
of
a
ruddy
morning
sky
beyond
.
<EOS>
I
remember
something
,
too
,
of
the
green
grave
-
mounds
;
and
I
have
not
forgotten
,
either
,
two
figures
of
strangers
straying
amongst
the
low
hillocks
and
reading
the
mementoes
graven
on
the
few
mossy
head
-
stones
.
<EOS>
I
noticed
them
,
because
,
as
they
saw
us
,
they
passed
round
to
the
back
of
the
church
;
and
I
doubted
not
they
were
going
to
enter
by
the
side
-
aisle
door
and
witness
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
By
Mr.
Rochester
they
were
not
observed
;
he
was
earnestly
looking
at
my
face
from
which
the
blood
had
<EOS>
,
I
daresay
,
momentarily
fled
:
for
I
felt
my
forehead
dewy
,
and
my
cheeks
and
lips
cold
.
<EOS>
When
I
rallied
,
which
I
soon
did
,
he
walked
gently
with
me
up
the
path
to
the
porch
.
  
<EOS>
We
entered
the
quiet
and
humble
temple
;
the
priest
waited
in
his
white
surplice
at
the
lowly
altar
,
the
clerk
beside
him
.
<EOS>
All
was
still
:
two
shadows
only
moved
in
a
remote
corner
.
<EOS>
My
conjecture
had
been
correct
:
the
strangers
had
slipped
in
before
us
,
and
they
now
stood
by
the
vault
of
the
Rochesters
,
their
backs
towards
us
,
viewing
through
the
rails
the
old
time
-
stained
marble
tomb
,
where
a
kneeling
angel
guarded
the
remains
of
Damer
de
Rochester
,
slain
at
Marston
Moor
in
the
time
of
the
civil
wars
,
and
of
Elizabeth
,
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Our
place
was
taken
at
the
communion
rails
.
<EOS>
Hearing
a
cautious
step
behind
me
,
I
glanced
over
my
shoulder
:
one
of
the
strangers
 
a
gentleman
,
evidently
 
was
advancing
up
the
chancel
.
<EOS>
The
service
began
.
<EOS>
The
explanation
of
the
intent
of
matrimony
was
gone
through
;
and
then
the
clergyman
came
a
step
further
forward
,
and
,
bending
slightly
towards
Mr.
Rochester
,
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
require
and
charge
you
both
(
as
ye
will
answer
at
the
dreadful
day
of
judgment
,
when
the
secrets
of
all
hearts
shall
be
disclosed
)
,
that
if
either
of
you
know
any
impediment
why
ye
may
not
lawfully
be
joined
together
in
matrimony
,
ye
do
now
confess
it
;
for
be
<EOS>
ye
<EOS>
well
assured
that
so
many
as
are
coupled
together
otherwise
than
God
's
Word
doth
allow
,
are
not
joined
together
by
God
,
neither
is
their
matrimony
lawful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
,
as
the
custom
is
.
<EOS>
When
is
the
pause
after
that
sentence
ever
broken
by
reply
?
<EOS>
Not
,
perhaps
,
once
in
a
hundred
years
.
<EOS>
And
the
clergyman
,
who
had
not
lifted
his
eyes
from
his
book
,
and
had
held
his
breath
but
for
a
moment
,
was
proceeding
:
his
hand
was
already
stretched
towards
Mr.
Rochester
,
as
his
lips
unclosed
to
ask
,
"
Wilt
thou
have
this
woman
for
thy
wedded
wife
?
"
 
when
a
distinct
and
near
voice
said
    
"
The
marriage
can
not
go
on
:
I
declare
the
existence
of
an
impediment
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
clergyman
looked
up
at
the
speaker
and
stood
mute
;
the
clerk
did
the
same
;
Mr.
Rochester
moved
slightly
,
as
if
an
earthquake
had
rolled
under
his
feet
:
taking
a
firmer
footing
,
and
not
turning
his
head
or
eyes
,
he
said
,
"
Proceed
.
"
  
<EOS>
Profound
silence
fell
when
he
had
uttered
that
word
,
with
deep
but
low
intonation
.
<EOS>
Presently
Mr.
Wood
said
    
"
I
can
not
proceed
without
some
investigation
into
what
has
been
asserted
,
and
evidence
of
its
truth
or
falsehood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
ceremony
is
quite
broken
off
,
"
subjoined
the
voice
behind
us
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
in
a
condition
to
prove
my
allegation
:
an
insuperable
impediment
to
this
marriage
exists
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
heard
,
but
heeded
not
:
he
stood
stubborn
and
rigid
,
making
no
movement
but
to
possess
himself
of
my
hand
.
<EOS>
What
a
hot
and
strong
grasp
he
had
!
<EOS>
and
how
like
quarried
marble
was
his
pale
,
firm
,
massive
front
at
this
moment
!
<EOS>
How
his
eye
shone
,
still
watchful
,
and
yet
wild
beneath
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
seemed
at
a
loss
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
nature
of
the
impediment
?
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
may
be
got
over
 
explained
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hardly
,
"
was
the
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
called
it
insuperable
,
and
I
speak
advisedly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
speaker
came
forward
and
leaned
on
the
rails
.
<EOS>
He
continued
,
uttering
each
word
distinctly
,
<EOS>
calmly
,
steadily
,
but
not
loudly
    
"
It
simply
consists
in
the
existence
of
a
previous
marriage
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
has
a
wife
now
living
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
nerves
vibrated
to
those
low
-
spoken
words
as
they
had
never
vibrated
to
thunder
 
<EOS>
my
blood
felt
their
subtle
violence
as
it
had
never
felt
frost
or
fire
;
but
I
was
collected
,
and
in
no
danger
of
swooning
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
Mr.
Rochester
:
I
made
him
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
His
whole
face
was
colourless
rock
:
his
eye
was
both
spark
and
flint
.
<EOS>
He
disavowed
nothing
:
he
seemed
as
if
he
would
defy
all
things
.
<EOS>
Without
speaking
,
without
smiling
,
without
seeming
to
recognise
in
me
a
human
being
,
he
only
twined
my
waist
with
his
arm
and
riveted
me
to
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
of
the
intruder
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Briggs
,
a
solicitor
of
 
Street
,
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
would
thrust
on
me
a
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
remind
you
of
your
lady
's
existence
,
sir
,
which
the
law
recognises
,
if
you
do
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Favour
me
with
an
account
of
her
 
with
her
name
,
her
parentage
,
her
place
of
abode
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Briggs
calmly
took
a
paper
from
his
pocket
,
and
read
out
in
a
sort
of
official
,
nasal
voice
:
    
"
"
I
affirm
and
can
prove
that
on
the
20th
of
October
A.D.
 
(
a
date
of
fifteen
years
back
)
,
Edward
Fairfax
Rochester
,
of
Thornfield
Hall
,
in
the
county
of
,
and
of
Ferndean
Manor
,
in
shire
,
England
,
was
married
to
my
sister
,
Bertha
Antoinetta
Mason
,
daughter
of
Jonas
Mason
,
merchant
,
and
of
Antoinetta
<EOS>
his
wife
,
a
Creole
,
at
 
church
,
Spanish
Town
,
Jamaica
.
<EOS>
The
record
of
the
marriage
will
be
found
in
the
register
of
that
church
 
a
copy
of
it
is
now
in
my
possession
.
<EOS>
Signed
,
Richard
Mason
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
 
if
a
genuine
document
 
may
prove
I
have
been
married
,
but
it
does
not
prove
that
the
woman
mentioned
therein
as
my
wife
is
still
living
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
living
three
months
ago
,
"
returned
the
lawyer
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
witness
to
the
fact
,
whose
testimony
even
you
,
sir
,
will
scarcely
controvert
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Produce
him
 
or
go
to
hell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
produce
him
first
 
<EOS>
he
is
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mason
,
have
the
goodness
to
step
forward
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
,
on
hearing
the
name
,
set
his
teeth
;
he
experienced
,
too
,
a
sort
of
strong
convulsive
quiver
;
near
to
him
as
I
was
,
I
felt
the
spasmodic
movement
of
fury
or
despair
run
through
his
frame
.
<EOS>
The
second
stranger
,
who
had
hitherto
lingered
in
the
background
,
now
drew
near
;
a
pale
face
looked
over
the
solicitor
's
shoulder
 
<EOS>
yes
,
it
was
Mason
himself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
turned
and
glared
at
him
.
<EOS>
His
eye
,
as
I
have
often
said
,
was
a
black
eye
:
it
had
now
a
tawny
,
nay
,
a
bloody
light
in
its
gloom
;
and
his
face
flushed
 
olive
cheek
and
hueless
forehead
received
a
glow
as
from
spreading
,
ascending
heart
-
fire
:
and
he
stirred
,
lifted
his
strong
arm
 
he
could
have
struck
Mason
,
dashed
him
on
the
church
-
floor
,
shocked
by
ruthless
blow
the
breath
from
his
body
 
<EOS>
but
Mason
shrank
away
,
and
cried
faintly
,
"
Good
God
!
"
<EOS>
Contempt
fell
cool
on
Mr.
Rochester
 
his
passion
died
as
if
a
blight
had
shrivelled
it
up
:
he
only
asked
 
"
What
have
_
<EOS>
you
_
to
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
An
inaudible
reply
escaped
Mason
's
white
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
devil
is
in
it
if
you
can
not
answer
distinctly
.
<EOS>
I
again
demand
,
what
have
you
to
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
 
sir
,
"
interrupted
the
clergyman
,
"
do
not
forget
you
are
in
a
sacred
place
.
"
<EOS>
Then
addressing
Mason
,
he
inquired
gently
,
"
Are
you
aware
,
sir
,
whether
or
not
this
gentleman
's
wife
is
still
living
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Courage
,
"
urged
the
lawyer
,
 
"
speak
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
now
living
at
Thornfield
Hall
,
"
said
Mason
,
in
more
articulate
tones
:
"
I
saw
her
there
last
April
.
<EOS>
I
am
her
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
At
Thornfield
Hall
!
"
ejaculated
the
clergyman
.
"
<EOS>
Impossible
!
<EOS>
I
am
an
old
resident
in
this
neighbourhood
,
sir
,
and
I
never
heard
of
a
Mrs.
Rochester
at
Thornfield
Hall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
saw
a
grim
smile
contort
Mr.
Rochester
's
lips
,
and
he
muttered
    
"
<EOS>
No
,
by
God
!
<EOS>
I
took
care
that
none
should
hear
of
it
 
or
of
her
under
that
name
.
"
<EOS>
He
mused
 
for
ten
minutes
he
held
counsel
with
himself
:
he
formed
his
resolve
,
and
announced
it
    
"
Enough
!
<EOS>
all
shall
bolt
out
at
once
,
like
the
bullet
from
the
barrel
.
<EOS>
Wood
,
close
your
book
and
take
off
your
surplice
;
John
Green
(
to
the
clerk
)
,
leave
the
church
:
there
will
be
no
wedding
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
The
man
obeyed
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
continued
,
hardily
and
recklessly
:
<EOS>
"
Bigamy
is
an
ugly
word
!
 
<EOS>
I
meant
,
however
,
to
be
a
bigamist
;
but
fate
has
out
-
manoeuvred
me
,
or
Providence
has
checked
me
,
 
perhaps
the
last
.
<EOS>
I
am
little
better
than
a
devil
at
this
moment
;
and
,
as
my
pastor
there
would
tell
me
,
deserve
no
doubt
the
sternest
judgments
of
God
,
even
to
the
quenchless
fire
and
deathless
worm
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
my
plan
is
broken
up
:
 
what
this
lawyer
and
his
client
say
is
true
:
I
have
been
married
,
and
the
woman
to
whom
I
was
married
lives
!
<EOS>
You
say
you
never
heard
of
a
Mrs.
Rochester
at
the
house
up
yonder
,
Wood
;
but
I
daresay
you
have
many
a
time
inclined
your
ear
to
gossip
about
the
mysterious
lunatic
kept
there
under
watch
and
ward
.
<EOS>
Some
have
whispered
to
you
that
she
is
my
bastard
half
-
sister
:
some
,
my
cast
-
off
mistress
.
<EOS>
I
now
inform
you
that
she
is
my
wife
,
whom
I
married
fifteen
years
ago
,
 
Bertha
Mason
by
name
;
sister
of
this
resolute
personage
,
who
is
now
,
with
his
quivering
limbs
and
white
cheeks
,
showing
you
what
a
stout
heart
men
may
bear
.
<EOS>
Cheer
up
,
Dick
!
 
<EOS>
never
fear
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
'd
almost
as
soon
strike
a
woman
as
you
.
<EOS>
Bertha
Mason
is
mad
;
and
she
came
of
a
mad
family
;
idiots
and
maniacs
through
three
generations
!
<EOS>
Her
mother
,
the
Creole
,
was
both
a
madwoman
and
a
drunkard
!
 
<EOS>
as
I
found
out
after
I
had
we
d
the
daughter
:
for
they
were
silent
on
family
secrets
before
.
<EOS>
Bertha
,
like
a
dutiful
child
,
copied
her
parent
in
both
points
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
charming
partner
 
<EOS>
pure
,
wise
,
modest
<EOS>
:
you
can
fancy
<EOS>
I
was
a
happy
man
.
<EOS>
I
went
through
rich
scenes
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
experience
has
been
heavenly
,
if
you
only
knew
it
!
<EOS>
But
I
owe
you
no
further
explanation
.
<EOS>
Briggs
,
Wood
,
Mason
,
I
invite
you
all
to
come
up
to
the
house
and
visit
Mrs.
Poole
's
patient
,
and
_
my
wife
_
!
<EOS>
You
shall
see
what
sort
of
a
being
<EOS>
I
was
cheated
into
espousing
,
and
judge
whether
or
not
I
had
a
right
to
break
the
compact
,
and
seek
sympathy
with
something
at
least
human
.
<EOS>
This
girl
,
"
he
continued
,
looking
at
me
,
"
knew
no
more
than
you
,
Wood
,
of
the
disgusting
secret
:
she
thought
all
was
fair
and
legal
and
never
dreamt
<EOS>
she
was
going
to
be
entrapped
into
a
feigned
union
with
a
defrauded
wretch
,
already
bound
to
a
bad
,
mad
,
and
embruted
partner
!
<EOS>
Come
all
of
you
 
follow
!
"
  
<EOS>
Still
holding
me
fast
,
he
left
the
church
:
the
three
gentlemen
came
after
.
<EOS>
At
the
front
door
of
the
hall
we
found
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
it
back
to
the
coach
-
house
,
John
,
"
said
Mr.
Rochester
coolly
;
"
it
will
not
be
wanted
to
-
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
our
entrance
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
Adele
,
Sophie
,
Leah
,
advanced
to
meet
and
greet
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
the
right
-
about
 
every
soul
!
"
cried
the
master
;
"
away
with
your
congratulations
!
<EOS>
Who
wants
them
?
<EOS>
Not
I
!
 
<EOS>
they
are
fifteen
years
too
late
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
passed
on
and
ascended
the
stairs
,
still
holding
my
hand
,
and
still
beckoning
the
gentlemen
to
follow
him
,
which
they
did
.
<EOS>
We
mounted
the
first
staircase
,
passed
up
the
gallery
,
proceeded
to
the
third
storey
:
the
low
,
black
door
,
opened
by
Mr.
Rochester
's
master
-
key
,
admitted
us
to
the
tapestried
room
,
with
its
great
bed
and
its
pictorial
cabinet
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
this
place
,
Mason
,
"
said
our
guide
;
"
she
bit
and
stabbed
you
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
lifted
the
hangings
from
the
wall
,
uncovering
the
second
door
:
this
,
too
,
he
opened
.
<EOS>
In
a
room
without
a
window
,
there
burnt
a
fire
guarded
by
a
high
and
strong
fender
,
and
a
lamp
suspended
from
the
ceiling
by
a
chain
.
<EOS>
Grace
Poole
bent
over
the
fire
,
apparently
cooking
something
in
a
saucepan
.
<EOS>
In
the
deep
shade
,
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
,
a
figure
ran
backwards
and
forwards
.
<EOS>
What
it
was
,
whether
beast
or
human
being
,
one
could
not
,
at
first
sight
,
tell
:
it
grovelled
,
seemingly
,
on
all
fours
;
it
snatched
and
growled
like
some
strange
wild
animal
:
but
it
was
covered
with
clothing
,
and
a
quantity
of
dark
,
grizzled
hair
,
wild
as
a
mane
,
hid
its
head
and
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
morrow
,
Mrs.
Poole
!
"
said
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
?
<EOS>
and
how
is
your
charge
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
're
tolerable
,
sir
,
I
thank
you
,
"
replied
Grace
,
lifting
the
boiling
mess
carefully
on
to
the
hob
:
"
rather
snappish
,
but
not
"
rageous
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
fierce
cry
seemed
to
give
the
lie
to
her
favourable
report
:
the
clothed
hyena
rose
up
,
and
stood
tall
on
its
hind
-
feet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
sir
,
she
sees
you
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Grace
:
"
you
'd
better
not
stay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
a
few
moments
,
Grace
:
you
must
allow
me
a
few
moments
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
care
then
,
sir
!
 
for
God
's
sake
,
take
care
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
maniac
bellowed
:
she
parted
her
shaggy
locks
from
her
visage
,
and
gazed
wildly
at
her
visitors
.
<EOS>
I
recognised
well
that
purple
face
,
 
those
bloated
features
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poole
advanced
.
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
out
of
the
way
,
"
said
Mr.
Rochester
,
thrusting
her
aside
:
"
she
has
no
knife
now
,
I
suppose
,
and
I
'm
on
my
guard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
never
knows
what
she
has
,
sir
:
she
is
so
cunning
:
<EOS>
it
is
not
in
mortal
discretion
to
fathom
her
craft
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
had
better
leave
her
,
"
whispered
Mason
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
to
the
devil
!
"
<EOS>
was
his
brother
-
in
-
law
's
recommendation
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Ware
!
"
cried
Grace
.
<EOS>
The
three
gentlemen
retreated
simultaneously
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
flung
me
behind
him
:
the
lunatic
sprang
and
grappled
his
throat
viciously
,
and
laid
her
teeth
to
his
cheek
:
they
struggled
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
big
woman
,
in
stature
almost
equalling
her
husband
,
and
corpulent
besides
:
she
showed
virile
force
in
the
contest
 
more
than
once
she
almost
throttled
him
,
athletic
as
he
was
.
<EOS>
He
could
have
settled
her
with
a
well
-
planted
blow
;
but
he
would
not
strike
:
he
would
only
wrestle
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
mastered
her
arms
;
Grace
Poole
gave
him
a
cord
,
and
he
pinioned
them
behind
her
:
with
more
rope
,
which
was
at
hand
,
he
bound
her
to
a
chair
.
<EOS>
The
operation
was
performed
amidst
the
fiercest
yells
and
the
most
convulsive
plunges
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
then
turned
to
the
spectators
:
he
looked
at
them
with
a
smile
both
acrid
and
desolate
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
_
<EOS>
my
wife
_
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
is
the
sole
conjugal
embrace
I
am
ever
to
know
 
<EOS>
such
are
the
endearments
which
are
to
solace
my
leisure
hours
!
<EOS>
And
_
this
_
is
what
I
wished
to
have
"
(
laying
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
)
:
"
this
young
girl
,
who
stands
so
grave
and
quiet
at
the
mouth
of
hell
,
looking
collectedly
at
the
gambols
of
a
demon
,
I
wanted
her
just
as
a
change
after
that
fierce
ragout
.
<EOS>
Wood
and
Briggs
,
look
at
the
difference
!
<EOS>
Compare
these
clear
eyes
with
the
red
balls
yonder
 
<EOS>
this
face
with
that
mask
 
<EOS>
this
form
with
that
bulk
;
then
judge
me
,
priest
of
the
gospel
and
man
of
the
law
,
and
remember
with
what
judgment
ye
judge
ye
shall
be
judged
!
<EOS>
Off
with
you
now
.
<EOS>
I
must
shut
up
my
prize
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
all
withdrew
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
stayed
a
moment
behind
us
,
to
give
some
further
order
to
Grace
Poole
.
<EOS>
The
solicitor
addressed
me
as
he
descended
the
stair
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
madam
,
"
said
he
,
"
are
cleared
from
all
blame
:
your
uncle
will
be
glad
to
hear
it
 
if
,
indeed
,
he
should
be
still
living
 
when
Mr.
Mason
returns
to
Madeira
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
!
<EOS>
What
of
him
?
<EOS>
Do
you
know
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Mason
does
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Eyre
has
been
the
Funchal
correspondent
of
his
house
for
some
years
.
<EOS>
When
your
uncle
received
your
letter
intimating
the
contemplated
union
between
yourself
and
Mr.
Rochester
,
Mr.
Mason
,
who
was
staying
at
Madeira
to
recruit
his
health
,
on
his
way
back
to
Jamaica
,
happened
to
be
with
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Eyre
mentioned
the
intelligence
;
for
he
knew
that
my
client
here
was
acquainted
with
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
Rochester
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mason
,
astonished
and
distressed
as
you
may
suppose
,
revealed
the
real
state
of
matters
.
<EOS>
Your
uncle
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
is
now
on
a
sick
bed
;
from
which
,
considering
the
nature
of
his
disease
 
decline
 
and
the
stage
it
has
reached
,
it
is
unlikely
he
will
ever
rise
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
then
hasten
to
England
himself
,
to
extricate
you
from
the
snare
into
which
you
had
fallen
,
but
he
implored
Mr.
Mason
to
lose
no
time
in
taking
steps
to
prevent
the
false
marriage
.
<EOS>
He
referred
him
to
me
for
assistance
.
<EOS>
I
used
all
despatch
,
and
am
thankful
I
was
not
too
late
:
as
you
,
doubtless
,
must
be
also
.
<EOS>
Were
I
not
morally
certain
that
your
uncle
will
be
dead
ere
<EOS>
you
reach
Madeira
,
I
would
advise
you
to
accompany
Mr.
Mason
back
;
but
as
it
is
,
I
think
you
had
better
remain
in
England
till
you
can
hear
further
,
either
from
or
of
Mr.
Eyre
.
<EOS>
Have
we
anything
else
to
stay
for
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
of
Mr.
Mason
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
 
let
us
be
gone
,
"
was
the
anxious
reply
;
and
without
waiting
to
take
leave
of
Mr.
Rochester
,
they
made
their
exit
at
the
hall
door
.
<EOS>
The
clergyman
stayed
to
exchange
a
few
sentences
,
either
of
admonition
or
reproof
,
with
his
haughty
parishioner
;
this
duty
done
,
he
too
departed
.
  
<EOS>
I
heard
him
go
as
I
stood
at
the
half
-
open
door
of
my
own
room
,
to
which
I
had
now
withdrawn
.
<EOS>
The
house
cleared
,
I
shut
myself
in
,
fastened
the
bolt
that
none
might
intrude
,
and
proceeded
 
not
to
weep
,
not
to
mourn
,
I
was
yet
too
calm
for
that
,
but
 
mechanically
to
take
off
the
wedding
dress
,
and
replace
it
by
the
stuff
gown
I
had
worn
yesterday
,
as
I
thought
,
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
I
then
sat
down
:
I
felt
weak
and
tired
.
<EOS>
I
leaned
my
arms
on
a
table
,
and
my
head
dropped
on
them
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
thought
:
till
now
I
had
only
heard
,
seen
,
moved
 
followed
up
and
down
where
I
was
led
or
dragged
 
watched
event
rush
on
event
,
disclosure
open
beyond
disclosure
:
<EOS>
but
_
now
_
,
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
thought
_
.
  
<EOS>
The
morning
had
been
a
quiet
morning
enough
 
<EOS>
all
except
the
brief
scene
with
the
lunatic
:
the
transaction
in
the
church
had
not
been
noisy
;
there
was
no
explosion
of
passion
,
no
loud
altercation
,
no
dispute
,
no
defiance
or
challenge
,
no
tears
,
no
sobs
:
a
few
words
had
been
spoken
,
a
calmly
pronounced
objection
to
the
marriage
made
;
some
stern
,
short
questions
put
by
Mr.
Rochester
;
answers
,
explanations
given
,
evidence
adduced
;
an
open
admission
of
the
truth
had
been
uttered
by
my
master
;
then
the
living
proof
had
been
seen
;
the
intruders
were
gone
,
and
all
was
over
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
in
my
own
room
as
usual
 
just
myself
,
without
obvious
change
:
<EOS>
nothing
had
smitten
me
,
or
scathed
me
,
or
maimed
me
.
<EOS>
And
yet
where
was
the
Jane
Eyre
of
yesterday
?
 
<EOS>
where
was
her
life
?
 
<EOS>
where
were
her
prospects
?
  
<EOS>
Jane
Eyre
,
who
had
been
an
ardent
,
expectant
woman
 
almost
a
bride
,
was
a
cold
,
solitary
girl
again
:
her
life
was
pale
;
her
prospects
were
desolate
.
<EOS>
A
Christmas
frost
had
come
at
midsummer
;
a
white
December
storm
had
whirled
over
June
;
ice
glazed
the
ripe
apples
,
drifts
crushed
the
blowing
roses
;
on
hayfield
and
cornfield
lay
a
frozen
shroud
:
<EOS>
lanes
which
last
night
blushed
full
of
flowers
,
to
-
day
were
pathless
with
untrodden
snow
;
and
the
woods
,
which
twelve
hours
since
waved
leafy
and
flagrant
as
groves
between
the
tropics
,
now
spread
,
waste
,
wild
,
and
white
as
pine
-
forests
in
wintry
Norway
.
<EOS>
My
hopes
were
all
dead
 
struck
with
a
subtle
doom
,
such
as
,
in
one
night
,
fell
on
all
the
first
-
born
in
the
land
of
Egypt
.
<EOS>
I
looked
on
my
cherished
wishes
,
yesterday
so
blooming
and
glowing
;
they
lay
stark
,
chill
,
livid
corpses
that
could
never
revive
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
my
love
:
<EOS>
that
feeling
which
was
my
master
's
 
which
he
had
created
;
it
shivered
in
my
heart
,
like
a
suffering
child
in
a
cold
cradle
;
sickness
and
anguish
had
seized
it
;
it
could
not
seek
Mr.
Rochester
's
arms
 
it
could
not
derive
warmth
from
his
breast
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
never
more
could
it
turn
to
him
;
for
faith
was
blighted
 
confidence
destroyed
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
was
not
to
me
what
he
had
been
;
for
he
was
not
what
I
had
thought
him
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
ascribe
vice
to
him
;
I
would
not
say
he
had
betrayed
me
;
but
the
attribute
of
stainless
truth
was
gone
from
his
idea
,
and
from
his
presence
I
must
go
:
<EOS>
_
that
_
I
perceived
well
.
<EOS>
When
 
how
 
whither
,
I
could
not
yet
discern
;
but
he
himself
,
I
doubted
not
,
would
hurry
me
from
Thornfield
.
<EOS>
Real
affection
,
it
seemed
,
he
could
not
have
for
me
;
it
had
been
only
fitful
passion
:
that
was
balked
;
he
would
want
me
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
should
fear
even
to
cross
his
path
now
:
my
view
must
be
hateful
to
him
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
blind
had
been
my
eyes
!
<EOS>
How
weak
my
conduct
!
  
<EOS>
My
eyes
were
covered
and
closed
:
eddying
darkness
seemed
to
swim
round
me
,
and
reflection
came
in
as
black
and
confused
a
flow
.
<EOS>
Self
-
abandoned
,
relaxed
,
and
effortless
,
I
seemed
to
have
laid
me
down
in
the
dried
-
up
bed
of
a
great
river
;
I
heard
a
flood
loosened
in
remote
mountains
,
and
felt
the
torrent
come
:
to
rise
I
had
no
will
,
to
flee
I
had
no
strength
.
<EOS>
I
lay
faint
,
longing
to
be
dead
.
<EOS>
One
idea
only
still
throbbed
life
-
like
within
me
 
a
remembrance
of
God
:
it
begot
an
unuttered
prayer
:
these
words
went
wandering
up
and
down
in
my
rayless
mind
,
as
something
that
should
be
whispered
,
but
no
energy
was
found
to
express
them
    
<EOS>
"
Be
not
far
from
me
,
for
trouble
is
near
:
there
is
none
to
help
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
near
:
and
as
I
had
lifted
no
petition
to
Heaven
to
avert
it
 
as
I
had
neither
joined
my
hands
,
nor
bent
my
knees
,
nor
moved
my
lips
 
<EOS>
it
came
:
in
full
heavy
swing
the
torrent
poured
over
me
.
<EOS>
The
whole
consciousness
of
my
life
lorn
,
my
love
lost
,
my
hope
quenched
,
my
faith
death
-
struck
,
swayed
full
and
mighty
above
me
in
one
sullen
mass
.
<EOS>
That
bitter
hour
can
not
be
described
:
in
truth
,
"
the
waters
came
into
my
soul
;
I
sank
in
deep
mire
:
I
felt
no
standing
;
I
came
into
deep
waters
;
the
floods
overflowed
me
.
"
    
<EOS>
Some
time
in
the
afternoon
I
raised
my
head
,
and
looking
round
and
seeing
the
western
sun
gilding
the
sign
of
its
decline
on
the
wall
,
I
asked
,
"
What
am
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
answer
my
mind
gave
 
"
Leave
Thornfield
at
once
"
 
<EOS>
was
so
prompt
,
so
dread
,
that
I
stopped
my
ears
.
<EOS>
I
said
I
could
not
bear
such
words
now
.
<EOS>
"
That
I
am
not
Edward
Rochester
's
bride
is
the
least
part
of
my
woe
,
"
I
alleged
:
"
that
I
have
wakened
out
of
most
glorious
dreams
,
and
found
them
all
void
and
vain
,
is
a
horror
I
could
bear
and
master
;
but
that
I
must
leave
him
decidedly
,
instantly
,
entirely
,
is
intolerable
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
then
,
a
voice
within
me
averred
that
I
could
do
it
and
foretold
that
I
should
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
wrestled
with
my
own
resolution
:
I
wanted
to
be
weak
that
I
might
avoid
the
awful
passage
of
further
suffering
I
saw
laid
out
for
me
;
and
Conscience
,
turned
tyrant
,
held
Passion
by
the
throat
,
told
her
tauntingly
<EOS>
,
she
had
yet
but
dipped
her
dainty
foot
in
the
slough
,
and
swore
that
with
that
arm
of
iron
he
would
thrust
her
down
to
unsounded
depths
of
agony
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
be
torn
away
,
"
then
I
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Let
another
help
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
you
shall
tear
yourself
away
<EOS>
,
none
shall
help
you
:
you
shall
yourself
pluck
out
your
right
eye
;
yourself
cut
off
your
right
hand
:
your
heart
shall
be
the
victim
,
and
you
the
priest
to
transfix
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
rose
up
suddenly
,
terror
-
struck
at
the
solitude
which
so
ruthless
a
judge
haunted
,
 
at
the
silence
which
so
awful
a
voice
filled
.
<EOS>
My
head
swam
as
I
stood
erect
.
<EOS>
I
perceived
that
I
was
sickening
from
excitement
and
inanition
;
neither
meat
nor
drink
had
passed
my
lips
that
day
,
for
I
had
taken
no
breakfast
.
<EOS>
And
,
with
a
strange
pang
,
I
now
reflected
that
,
long
as
I
had
been
shut
up
here
,
no
message
had
been
sent
to
ask
how
I
was
,
or
to
invite
me
to
come
down
:
not
even
little
Adele
had
tapped
at
the
door
;
not
even
Mrs.
Fairfax
had
sought
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Friends
always
forget
those
whom
fortune
forsakes
,
"
I
murmured
,
as
I
undrew
the
bolt
and
passed
out
.
<EOS>
I
stumbled
over
an
obstacle
:
my
head
was
still
dizzy
,
my
sight
was
dim
,
and
my
limbs
were
feeble
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
soon
recover
myself
.
<EOS>
I
fell
,
but
not
on
to
the
ground
:
an
outstretched
arm
caught
me
.
<EOS>
I
looked
up
 
<EOS>
I
was
supported
by
Mr.
Rochester
,
who
sat
in
a
chair
across
my
chamber
threshold
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
come
out
at
last
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
have
been
waiting
for
you
long
,
and
listening
:
<EOS>
yet
not
one
movement
<EOS>
have
I
heard
,
nor
one
sob
:
five
minutes
more
of
that
death
-
like
hush
,
and
I
should
have
forced
the
lock
like
a
burglar
.
<EOS>
So
you
shun
me
?
 
<EOS>
you
shut
yourself
up
and
grieve
alone
!
<EOS>
I
would
rather
you
had
come
and
upbraided
me
with
vehemence
.
<EOS>
You
are
passionate
.
<EOS>
I
expected
a
scene
of
some
kind
.
<EOS>
I
was
prepared
for
the
hot
rain
of
tears
;
only
I
wanted
them
to
be
shed
on
my
breast
:
now
a
senseless
floor
has
received
them
,
or
your
drenched
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
But
I
err
:
you
have
not
wept
at
all
!
<EOS>
I
see
a
white
cheek
and
a
faded
eye
,
but
no
trace
of
tears
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
then
,
your
heart
has
been
weeping
blood
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Jane
!
<EOS>
not
a
word
of
reproach
?
<EOS>
Nothing
bitter
 
nothing
poignant
?
<EOS>
Nothing
to
cut
a
feeling
or
sting
a
passion
?
<EOS>
You
sit
quietly
where
I
have
placed
you
,
and
regard
me
with
a
weary
,
passive
look
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Jane
,
I
never
meant
to
wound
you
thus
.
<EOS>
If
the
man
who
had
but
one
little
ewe
lamb
that
was
dear
to
him
as
a
daughter
,
that
ate
of
his
bread
and
drank
of
his
cup
,
and
lay
in
his
bosom
,
had
by
some
mistake
slaughtered
it
at
the
shambles
,
he
would
not
have
rued
his
bloody
blunder
more
than
I
now
rue
mine
.
<EOS>
Will
you
ever
forgive
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Reader
,
I
forgave
him
at
the
moment
and
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
There
was
such
deep
remorse
in
his
eye
,
such
true
pity
in
his
tone
,
such
manly
energy
in
his
manner
;
and
besides
,
there
was
such
unchanged
love
in
his
whole
look
and
mien
 
<EOS>
I
forgave
him
all
:
yet
not
in
words
,
not
outwardly
;
only
at
my
heart
's
core
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
am
a
scoundrel
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
ere
long
he
inquired
wistfully
 
wondering
,
I
suppose
,
at
my
continued
silence
and
tameness
,
the
result
rather
of
weakness
than
of
will
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
tell
me
so
roundly
and
sharply
 
do
n't
spare
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
:
I
am
tired
and
sick
.
<EOS>
I
want
some
water
.
"
<EOS>
He
heaved
a
sort
of
shuddering
sigh
,
and
taking
me
in
his
arms
,
carried
me
downstairs
.
<EOS>
At
first
I
did
not
know
to
what
room
he
had
borne
me
;
all
was
cloudy
to
my
glazed
sight
:
presently
I
felt
the
reviving
warmth
of
a
fire
;
for
,
summer
as
it
was
,
I
had
become
icy
cold
in
my
chamber
.
<EOS>
He
put
wine
to
my
lips
;
I
tasted
it
and
revived
;
then
I
ate
something
he
offered
me
,
and
was
soon
myself
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
the
library
 
sitting
in
his
chair
 
<EOS>
he
was
quite
near
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
could
go
out
of
life
now
,
without
too
sharp
a
pang
,
it
would
be
well
for
me
,
"
I
thought
;
"
then
I
should
not
have
to
make
the
effort
of
cracking
my
heart
-
strings
in
rending
them
from
among
Mr.
Rochester
's
.
<EOS>
I
must
leave
him
,
it
appears
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
leave
him
 
I
can
not
leave
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
now
,
Jane
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Much
better
,
sir
;
I
shall
be
well
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Taste
the
wine
again
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
obeyed
him
;
then
he
put
the
glass
on
the
table
,
stood
before
me
,
and
looked
at
me
attentively
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
turned
away
,
with
an
inarticulate
exclamation
,
full
of
passionate
emotion
of
some
kind
;
he
walked
fast
through
the
room
and
came
back
;
he
stooped
towards
me
as
if
to
kiss
me
;
but
I
remembered
caresses
were
now
forbidden
.
<EOS>
I
turned
my
face
away
and
put
his
aside
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
How
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
know
!
<EOS>
you
wo
n't
kiss
the
husband
of
Bertha
Mason
?
<EOS>
You
consider
my
arms
filled
and
my
embraces
appropriated
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
there
is
neither
room
nor
claim
for
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
I
will
spare
you
the
trouble
of
much
talking
;
I
will
answer
for
you
 
Because
I
have
a
wife
already
,
you
would
reply
.
 
<EOS>
I
guess
rightly
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
think
so
,
you
must
have
a
strange
opinion
of
me
;
you
must
regard
me
as
a
plotting
profligate
 
<EOS>
a
base
and
low
rake
who
has
been
simulating
disinterested
love
in
order
to
draw
you
into
a
snare
deliberately
laid
,
and
strip
you
of
honour
and
rob
you
of
self
-
respect
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
to
that
?
<EOS>
I
see
you
can
say
nothing
in
the
first
place
,
you
are
faint
still
,
and
have
enough
to
do
to
draw
your
breath
;
in
the
second
place
,
you
can
not
yet
accustom
yourself
to
accuse
and
revile
me
,
and
besides
,
the
flood
-
gates
of
tears
are
opened
,
and
they
would
rush
out
if
you
spoke
much
;
and
you
have
no
desire
to
expostulate
,
to
upbraid
,
to
make
a
scene
:
you
are
thinking
how
_
to
act
_
 
<EOS>
_
talking
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
you
consider
is
of
no
use
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
 
<EOS>
I
am
on
my
guard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
do
not
wish
to
act
against
you
,
"
I
said
;
and
my
unsteady
voice
warned
me
to
curtail
my
sentence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
in
your
sense
of
the
word
,
but
in
mine
you
are
scheming
to
destroy
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
as
good
as
said
that
I
am
a
married
man
 
as
a
married
man
you
will
shun
me
,
keep
out
of
my
way
:
just
now
you
have
refused
to
kiss
me
.
<EOS>
You
intend
to
make
yourself
a
complete
stranger
to
me
:
to
live
under
this
roof
only
as
Adele
's
governess
;
if
ever
I
say
a
friendly
word
to
you
,
if
ever
a
friendly
feeling
inclines
you
again
to
me
,
you
will
say
,
 
"
That
man
had
nearly
made
me
his
mistress
:
I
must
be
ice
and
rock
to
him
;
"
and
ice
and
rock
you
will
accordingly
become
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
cleared
and
steadied
my
voice
to
reply
:
"
All
is
changed
about
me
,
sir
<EOS>
;
I
must
change
too
 
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
;
and
to
avoid
fluctuations
of
feeling
,
and
continual
combats
with
recollections
and
associations
,
there
is
only
one
way
 
<EOS>
Adele
must
have
a
new
governess
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Adele
will
go
to
school
 
<EOS>
I
have
settled
that
already
;
nor
do
I
mean
to
torment
you
with
the
hideous
associations
and
recollections
of
Thornfield
Hall
 
this
accursed
place
 
<EOS>
this
tent
of
Achan
 
<EOS>
this
insolent
vault
,
offering
the
ghastliness
of
living
death
to
the
light
of
the
open
sky
 
this
narrow
stone
hell
,
with
its
one
real
fiend
,
worse
than
a
legion
of
such
as
we
imagine
.
<EOS>
Jane
,
you
shall
not
stay
here
,
nor
will
I.
I
was
wrong
ever
to
bring
you
to
Thornfield
Hall
,
knowing
as
I
did
how
it
was
haunted
.
<EOS>
I
charged
them
to
conceal
from
you
,
before
I
ever
saw
you
,
all
knowledge
of
the
curse
of
the
place
;
merely
because
I
feared
Adele
never
would
have
a
governess
to
stay
if
she
knew
with
what
inmate
she
was
housed
,
and
my
plans
would
not
permit
me
to
remove
the
maniac
elsewhere
 
though
I
possess
an
old
house
,
Ferndean
Manor
,
even
more
retired
and
hidden
than
this
,
where
I
could
have
lodged
her
safely
enough
,
had
not
a
scruple
about
the
unhealthiness
of
the
situation
,
in
the
heart
of
a
wood
,
made
my
conscience
recoil
from
the
arrangement
.
<EOS>
Probably
those
damp
walls
would
soon
have
eased
me
of
her
charge
:
<EOS>
but
to
each
villain
his
own
vice
;
and
mine
is
not
a
tendency
to
indirect
assassination
,
even
of
what
I
most
hate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Concealing
the
mad
-
woman
's
neighbourhood
from
you
,
however
,
was
something
like
covering
a
child
with
a
cloak
and
laying
it
down
near
a
upas
-
tree
:
that
demon
's
vicinage
is
poisoned
,
and
always
was
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
shut
up
Thornfield
Hall
:
I
'll
nail
up
the
front
door
and
board
the
lower
windows
:
I
'll
give
Mrs.
Poole
two
hundred
a
year
to
live
here
with
_
my
wife
_
,
as
you
term
that
fearful
hag
:
Grace
will
do
much
for
money
,
and
she
shall
have
her
son
,
the
keeper
at
Grimsby
Retreat
,
to
bear
her
company
and
be
at
hand
to
give
her
aid
in
the
paroxysms
,
when
_
my
wife
_
is
prompted
by
her
familiar
to
burn
people
in
their
beds
at
night
,
to
stab
them
,
to
bite
their
flesh
from
their
bones
,
and
so
on
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Sir
,
"
I
interrupted
him
,
"
you
are
inexorable
for
that
unfortunate
lady
:
you
speak
of
her
with
hate
 
with
vindictive
antipathy
.
<EOS>
It
is
cruel
 
she
can
not
help
being
mad
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
my
little
darling
(
so
I
will
call
you
,
for
so
you
are
)
,
you
do
n't
know
what
you
are
talking
about
;
you
misjudge
me
again
:
it
is
not
because
she
is
mad
<EOS>
I
hate
her
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
mad
,
do
you
think
I
should
hate
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
indeed
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
mistaken
,
and
you
know
nothing
about
me
,
and
nothing
about
the
sort
of
love
of
which
I
am
capable
.
<EOS>
Every
atom
of
your
flesh
is
as
dear
to
me
as
my
own
:
in
pain
and
sickness
it
would
still
be
dear
.
<EOS>
Your
mind
is
my
treasure
,
and
if
it
were
broken
,
it
would
be
my
treasure
still
:
if
you
raved
,
my
arms
should
confine
you
,
and
not
a
strait
waistcoat
 
<EOS>
your
grasp
,
even
in
fury
,
would
have
a
charm
for
me
:
if
you
flew
at
me
as
wildly
as
that
woman
did
this
morning
,
I
should
receive
you
in
an
embrace
,
at
least
as
fond
as
it
would
be
restrictive
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
shrink
from
you
with
disgust
as
I
did
from
her
:
in
your
quiet
moments
you
should
have
no
watcher
and
no
nurse
but
me
;
and
I
could
hang
over
you
with
untiring
tenderness
,
though
you
gave
me
no
smile
in
return
;
and
never
weary
of
gazing
into
your
eyes
,
though
they
had
no
longer
a
ray
of
recognition
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
why
do
I
follow
that
train
of
ideas
?
<EOS>
I
was
talking
of
removing
you
from
Thornfield
.
<EOS>
All
,
you
know
,
is
prepared
for
prompt
departure
:
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
you
shall
go
.
<EOS>
I
only
ask
you
to
endure
one
more
night
under
this
roof
,
Jane
;
and
then
,
farewell
to
its
miseries
and
terrors
for
ever
!
<EOS>
I
have
a
place
to
repair
to
,
which
will
be
a
secure
sanctuary
from
hateful
reminiscences
,
from
unwelcome
intrusion
 
even
from
falsehood
and
slander
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
take
Adele
with
you
,
sir
,
"
I
interrupted
;
"
she
will
be
a
companion
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
I
told
you
I
would
send
Adele
to
school
;
and
what
do
I
want
with
a
child
for
a
companion
,
and
not
my
own
child
,
 
a
French
dancer
's
bastard
?
<EOS>
Why
do
you
importune
me
about
her
!
<EOS>
I
say
,
why
do
you
assign
Adele
to
me
for
a
companion
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
spoke
of
a
retirement
,
sir
;
and
retirement
and
solitude
are
dull
:
too
dull
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Solitude
!
solitude
!
"
<EOS>
he
reiterated
with
irritation
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
I
must
come
to
an
explanation
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
sphynx
-
like
expression
is
forming
in
your
countenance
.
<EOS>
You
are
to
share
my
solitude
.
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
:
it
required
a
degree
of
courage
,
excited
as
he
was
becoming
,
even
to
risk
that
mute
sign
of
dissent
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
walking
fast
about
the
room
,
and
he
stopped
,
as
if
suddenly
rooted
to
one
spot
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
long
and
hard
:
<EOS>
I
turned
my
eyes
from
him
,
fixed
them
on
the
fire
,
and
tried
to
assume
and
maintain
a
quiet
,
collected
aspect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
for
the
hitch
in
Jane
's
character
,
"
he
said
at
last
,
speaking
more
calmly
than
from
his
look
I
had
expected
him
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
The
reel
of
silk
has
run
smoothly
enough
so
far
;
but
I
always
knew
there
would
come
a
knot
and
a
puzzle
:
here
it
is
.
<EOS>
Now
for
vexation
,
and
exasperation
,
and
endless
trouble
!
<EOS>
By
God
!
<EOS>
I
long
to
exert
a
fraction
of
Samson
's
strength
,
and
break
the
entanglement
like
tow
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
recommenced
his
walk
,
but
soon
again
stopped
,
and
this
time
just
before
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
!
<EOS>
will
you
hear
reason
?
"
(
he
stooped
and
approached
his
lips
to
my
ear
)
;
"
because
,
if
you
wo
n't
,
I
'll
try
violence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
voice
was
hoarse
;
his
look
that
of
a
man
who
is
just
about
to
burst
an
insufferable
bond
and
plunge
headlong
into
wild
license
.
<EOS>
I
saw
that
in
another
moment
,
and
with
one
impetus
of
frenzy
more
,
I
should
be
able
to
do
nothing
with
him
.
<EOS>
The
present
 
<EOS>
the
passing
second
of
time
 
was
all
I
had
in
which
to
control
and
restrain
him
 
a
movement
of
repulsion
,
flight
<EOS>
,
fear
would
have
sealed
my
doom
,
 
and
his
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
not
afraid
:
not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
I
felt
an
inward
power
;
a
sense
of
influence
,
which
supported
me
.
<EOS>
The
crisis
was
perilous
;
but
not
without
its
charm
:
such
as
the
Indian
,
perhaps
,
feels
when
he
slips
over
the
rapid
in
his
canoe
.
<EOS>
I
took
hold
of
his
clenched
hand
,
loosened
the
contorted
fingers
,
and
said
to
him
,
soothingly
    
"
Sit
down
;
I
'll
talk
to
you
as
long
as
you
like
,
and
hear
all
you
have
to
say
,
whether
reasonable
or
unreasonable
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
sat
down
:
but
he
did
not
get
leave
to
speak
directly
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
struggling
with
tears
for
some
time
:
I
had
taken
great
pains
to
repress
them
,
because
I
knew
he
would
not
like
to
see
me
weep
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
I
considered
it
well
to
let
them
flow
as
freely
and
as
long
as
they
liked
.
<EOS>
If
the
flood
annoyed
him
,
so
much
the
better
.
<EOS>
So
I
gave
way
and
cried
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
I
heard
him
earnestly
entreating
me
to
be
composed
.
<EOS>
I
said
I
could
not
while
he
was
in
such
a
passion
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
not
angry
,
Jane
:
I
only
love
you
too
well
;
and
you
had
steeled
your
little
pale
face
with
such
a
resolute
,
frozen
look
,
I
could
not
endure
it
.
<EOS>
Hush
,
now
,
and
wipe
your
eyes
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
softened
voice
announced
that
he
was
subdued
;
so
I
,
in
my
turn
,
became
calm
.
<EOS>
Now
he
made
an
effort
to
rest
his
head
on
my
shoulder
,
but
I
would
not
permit
it
.
<EOS>
Then
he
would
draw
me
to
him
:
no
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
!
<EOS>
Jane
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
in
such
an
accent
of
bitter
sadness
it
thrilled
along
every
nerve
I
had
;
"
you
do
n't
love
me
,
then
?
<EOS>
It
was
only
my
station
,
and
the
rank
of
my
wife
,
that
you
valued
?
<EOS>
Now
that
you
think
me
disqualified
to
become
your
husband
,
you
recoil
from
my
touch
as
if
I
were
some
toad
or
ape
.
"
  
<EOS>
These
words
cut
me
:
yet
what
could
I
do
or
<EOS>
I
say
?
<EOS>
I
ought
probably
to
have
done
or
said
nothing
;
but
I
was
so
tortured
by
a
sense
of
remorse
at
thus
hurting
his
feelings
,
I
could
not
control
the
wish
to
drop
balm
where
I
had
wounded
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
do
_
love
you
,
"
I
said
,
"
more
than
ever
:
<EOS>
but
I
must
not
show
or
indulge
the
feeling
:
and
<EOS>
this
is
the
last
time
I
must
express
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
last
time
,
Jane
!
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
do
you
think
you
can
live
with
me
,
and
see
me
daily
,
and
<EOS>
yet
,
if
you
still
love
me
,
be
always
cold
and
distant
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
;
that
I
am
certain
I
could
not
;
and
therefore
I
see
there
is
but
<EOS>
one
way
<EOS>
:
but
you
will
be
furious
if
I
mention
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mention
it
!
<EOS>
If
I
storm
,
you
have
the
art
of
weeping
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rochester
,
I
must
leave
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
For
how
long
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
,
while
you
smooth
your
hair
 
which
is
somewhat
dishevelled
;
and
bathe
your
face
 
which
looks
feverish
?
"
  
"
I
must
leave
Adele
and
Thornfield
.
<EOS>
I
must
part
with
you
for
my
whole
life
:
I
must
begin
a
new
existence
among
strange
faces
and
strange
scenes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
:
I
told
you
you
should
.
<EOS>
I
pass
over
the
madness
about
parting
from
me
.
<EOS>
You
mean
you
must
become
a
part
of
me
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
new
existence
,
it
is
all
right
:
<EOS>
you
shall
yet
be
my
wife
:
I
am
not
married
.
<EOS>
You
shall
be
Mrs.
Rochester
 
both
virtually
and
nominally
.
<EOS>
I
shall
keep
only
to
you
so
long
as
you
and
I
live
.
<EOS>
You
shall
go
to
a
place
I
have
in
the
south
of
France
:
a
whitewashed
villa
on
the
shores
of
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
There
you
shall
live
a
happy
,
and
guarded
,
and
most
innocent
life
.
<EOS>
Never
fear
that
I
wish
to
lure
you
into
error
 
to
make
you
my
mistress
.
<EOS>
Why
did
you
shake
your
head
?
<EOS>
Jane
,
you
must
be
reasonable
,
or
in
truth
I
shall
again
become
frantic
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
voice
and
hand
quivered
:
his
large
nostrils
dilated
;
his
eye
blazed
:
<EOS>
still
I
dared
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
your
wife
is
living
:
that
is
a
fact
acknowledged
this
morning
by
yourself
.
<EOS>
If
I
lived
with
you
as
you
desire
,
I
should
then
be
your
mistress
:
to
say
otherwise
is
sophistical
 
is
false
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
I
am
not
a
gentle
-
tempered
man
 
<EOS>
you
forget
that
:
I
am
not
long-
enduring
;
I
am
not
cool
and
dispassionate
.
<EOS>
Out
of
pity
to
me
and
yourself
,
put
your
finger
on
my
pulse
,
feel
how
it
throbs
,
and
 
beware
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
bared
his
wrist
,
and
offered
it
to
me
:
the
blood
was
forsaking
his
cheek
and
lips
,
they
were
growing
livid
;
I
was
distressed
on
all
hands
.
<EOS>
To
agitate
him
thus
deeply
,
by
a
resistance
he
so
abhorred
,
was
cruel
:
to
yield
was
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
did
what
human
beings
do
instinctively
when
they
are
driven
to
utter
extremity
 
looked
for
aid
to
one
higher
than
man
:
the
words
"
God
help
me
!
"
<EOS>
burst
involuntarily
from
my
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
fool
!
"
cried
Mr.
Rochester
suddenly
.
<EOS>
"
I
keep
telling
her
I
am
not
married
,
and
do
not
explain
to
her
why
.
<EOS>
I
forget
she
knows
nothing
of
the
character
of
that
woman
,
or
of
the
circumstances
attending
my
infernal
union
with
her
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
am
certain
Jane
will
agree
with
me
in
opinion
,
when
she
knows
all
that
I
know
!
<EOS>
Just
put
your
hand
in
mine
,
Janet
 
that
I
may
have
the
evidence
of
touch
as
well
as
sight
,
to
prove
you
are
near
me
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
in
a
few
words
show
you
the
real
state
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
Can
you
listen
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
;
for
hours
if
you
will
.
"
  
"
I
ask
only
minutes
.
<EOS>
Jane
,
did
you
ever
hear
or
know
that
I
was
not
the
eldest
son
of
my
house
:
<EOS>
that
I
had
once
a
brother
older
than
I
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
Mrs.
Fairfax
told
me
so
once
.
"
  
"
And
did
you
ever
hear
that
my
father
was
an
avaricious
,
grasping
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
understood
something
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Jane
,
being
so
,
it
was
his
resolution
to
keep
the
property
together
;
he
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
dividing
his
estate
and
leaving
me
a
fair
portion
:
all
,
he
resolved
,
should
go
to
my
brother
,
Rowland
.
<EOS>
Yet
as
little
could
he
endure
that
a
son
of
his
should
be
a
poor
man
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
provided
for
by
a
wealthy
marriage
.
<EOS>
He
sought
me
a
partner
betimes
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mason
,
a
West
India
planter
and
merchant
,
was
his
old
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
He
was
certain
his
possessions
were
real
and
vast
:
he
made
inquiries
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mason
,
he
found
,
had
a
son
and
daughter
;
and
he
learned
from
him
that
he
could
and
would
give
the
latter
a
fortune
of
thirty
thousand
pounds
:
that
sufficed
.
<EOS>
When
I
left
college
,
I
was
sent
out
to
Jamaica
,
to
espouse
a
bride
already
courted
for
me
.
<EOS>
My
father
said
nothing
about
her
money
;
but
he
told
me
Miss
Mason
was
the
boast
of
Spanish
Town
for
her
beauty
:
and
this
was
no
lie
.
<EOS>
I
found
her
a
fine
woman
,
in
the
style
of
Blanche
Ingram
:
tall
,
dark
,
and
majestic
.
<EOS>
Her
family
wished
to
secure
me
because
I
was
of
a
good
race
;
and
so
did
she
.
<EOS>
They
showed
her
to
me
in
parties
,
splendidly
dressed
.
<EOS>
I
seldom
saw
her
alone
,
and
had
very
little
private
conversation
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
flattered
me
,
and
lavishly
displayed
for
my
pleasure
her
charms
and
accomplishments
.
<EOS>
All
the
men
in
her
circle
seemed
to
admire
her
and
envy
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
dazzled
,
stimulated
:
<EOS>
my
senses
were
excited
;
and
being
ignorant
,
raw
,
and
inexperienced
,
I
thought
I
loved
her
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
folly
so
besotted
that
the
idiotic
rivalries
of
society
,
the
prurience
,
the
rashness
,
the
blindness
of
youth
,
will
not
hurry
a
man
to
its
commission
.
<EOS>
Her
relatives
encouraged
me
;
competitors
piqued
me
;
she
allured
me
:
<EOS>
a
marriage
was
achieved
almost
before
I
knew
where
I
was
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
have
no
respect
for
myself
when
I
think
of
that
act
!
 
<EOS>
an
agony
of
inward
contempt
masters
me
.
<EOS>
I
never
loved
,
I
never
esteemed
,
I
did
not
even
know
her
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
sure
of
the
existence
of
one
virtue
in
her
nature
:
I
had
marked
neither
modesty
,
nor
benevolence
,
nor
candour
,
nor
refinement
in
her
mind
or
manners
 
<EOS>
and
,
I
married
her
:
 
<EOS>
gross
,
grovelling
,
mole
-
eyed
blockhead
that
I
was
!
<EOS>
With
less
sin
I
might
have
 
But
let
me
remember
to
whom
I
am
speaking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
bride
's
mother
I
had
never
seen
:
<EOS>
I
understood
she
was
dead
.
<EOS>
The
honeymoon
over
<EOS>
,
I
learned
my
mistake
;
she
was
only
mad
,
and
shut
up
in
a
lunatic
asylum
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
younger
brother
,
too
 
a
complete
dumb
idiot
.
<EOS>
The
elder
one
,
whom
you
have
seen
(
and
whom
I
can
not
hate
,
whilst
I
abhor
all
his
kindred
,
because
he
has
some
grains
of
affection
in
his
feeble
mind
,
shown
in
the
continued
interest
he
takes
in
his
wretched
sister
,
and
also
in
a
dog
-
like
attachment
he
once
bore
me
)
,
will
probably
be
in
the
same
state
one
day
.
<EOS>
My
father
and
my
brother
Rowland
knew
all
this
;
but
they
thought
only
of
the
thirty
thousand
pounds
,
and
joined
in
the
plot
against
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
These
were
vile
discoveries
;
but
except
for
the
treachery
of
concealment
,
I
should
have
made
them
no
subject
of
reproach
to
my
wife
,
even
when
I
found
her
nature
wholly
alien
to
mine
,
her
tastes
obnoxious
to
me
,
her
cast
of
mind
common
,
low
,
narrow
,
and
singularly
incapable
of
being
led
to
anything
higher
,
expanded
to
anything
larger
 
when
I
found
that
I
could
not
pass
a
single
evening
,
nor
even
a
single
hour
of
the
day
with
her
in
comfort
;
that
kindly
conversation
could
not
be
sustained
between
us
,
because
whatever
topic
I
started
,
immediately
received
from
her
a
turn
at
once
coarse
and
trite
,
perverse
and
imbecile
 
when
I
perceived
that
I
should
never
have
a
quiet
or
settled
household
,
because
no
servant
would
bear
the
continued
outbreaks
of
her
violent
and
unreasonable
temper
,
or
the
vexations
of
her
absurd
,
contradictory
,
exacting
orders
 
<EOS>
even
then
I
restrained
myself
:
<EOS>
I
eschewed
upbraiding
,
I
curtailed
remonstrance
;
I
tried
to
devour
my
repentance
and
disgust
in
secret
;
I
repressed
the
deep
antipathy
I
felt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
I
will
not
trouble
you
with
abominable
details
:
some
strong
words
shall
express
what
I
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
lived
with
that
woman
upstairs
four
years
,
and
before
that
time
she
had
tried
me
indeed
:
her
character
ripened
and
developed
with
frightful
rapidity
;
her
vices
sprang
up
fast
and
rank
:
<EOS>
they
were
so
strong
,
only
cruelty
could
check
them
,
and
I
would
not
use
cruelty
.
<EOS>
What
a
pigmy
intellect
she
had
,
and
what
giant
propensities
!
<EOS>
How
fearful
were
the
curses
those
propensities
entailed
on
me
!
<EOS>
Bertha
Mason
,
the
true
daughter
of
an
infamous
mother
,
dragged
me
through
all
the
hideous
and
degrading
agonies
which
must
attend
a
man
bound
to
a
wife
at
once
intemperate
and
unchaste
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
brother
in
the
interval
was
dead
,
and
at
the
end
of
the
four
years
my
father
died
too
.
<EOS>
I
was
rich
enough
now
 
yet
poor
to
hideous
indigence
:
a
nature
the
most
gross
,
impure
,
depraved
I
ever
saw
,
was
associated
with
mine
,
and
called
by
the
law
and
by
society
a
part
of
me
.
<EOS>
And
I
could
not
rid
myself
of
it
by
any
legal
proceedings
:
for
the
doctors
now
discovered
that
_
<EOS>
my
wife
_
was
mad
 
<EOS>
her
excesses
had
prematurely
developed
the
germs
of
insanity
.
<EOS>
Jane
,
you
do
n't
like
my
narrative
;
you
look
almost
sick
 
<EOS>
shall
I
defer
the
rest
to
another
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
finish
it
now
;
I
pity
you
 
<EOS>
I
do
earnestly
pity
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pity
,
Jane
,
from
some
people
is
a
noxious
and
insulting
sort
of
tribute
,
which
one
is
justified
in
hurling
back
in
the
teeth
of
those
who
offer
it
;
but
that
is
the
sort
of
pity
native
to
callous
,
selfish
hearts
;
it
is
a
hybrid
,
egotistical
pain
at
hearing
of
woes
,
crossed
with
ignorant
contempt
for
those
who
have
endured
them
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
not
your
pity
,
Jane
;
it
is
not
the
feeling
of
which
your
whole
face
is
full
at
this
moment
 
with
which
your
eyes
are
now
almost
overflowing
 
with
which
your
heart
is
heaving
 
with
which
your
hand
is
trembling
in
mine
.
<EOS>
Your
pity
,
my
darling
,
is
the
suffering
mother
of
love
:
its
anguish
is
the
very
natal
pang
of
the
divine
passion
.
<EOS>
I
accept
it
,
Jane
;
let
the
daughter
have
free
advent
 
<EOS>
my
arms
wait
to
receive
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
sir
,
proceed
;
what
did
you
do
when
you
found
she
was
mad
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
I
approached
the
verge
of
despair
;
a
remnant
of
self
-
respect
was
all
that
intervened
between
me
and
the
gulf
.
<EOS>
In
the
eyes
of
the
world
,
I
was
doubtless
covered
with
grimy
dishonour
;
but
I
resolved
to
be
clean
in
my
own
sight
 
and
to
the
last
<EOS>
I
repudiated
the
contamination
of
her
crimes
,
and
wrenched
myself
from
connection
with
her
mental
defects
.
<EOS>
Still
,
society
associated
my
name
and
person
with
hers
;
I
yet
saw
her
and
heard
her
daily
:
something
of
her
breath
(
faugh
!
)
<EOS>
mixed
with
the
air
I
breathed
;
and
besides
,
I
remembered
I
had
once
been
her
husband
 
<EOS>
that
recollection
was
then
,
and
is
now
,
inexpressibly
odious
to
me
;
moreover
,
I
knew
that
while
she
lived
I
could
never
be
the
husband
of
another
and
better
wife
;
and
,
though
five
years
my
senior
(
her
family
and
her
father
had
lied
to
me
even
in
the
particular
of
her
age
)
,
she
was
likely
to
live
as
long
as
I
,
being
as
robust
in
frame
as
she
was
infirm
in
mind
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
at
the
age
of
twenty
-
six
,
I
was
hopeless
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
night
I
had
been
awakened
by
her
yells
 
(
since
the
medical
men
had
pronounced
her
mad
,
she
had
,
of
course
,
been
shut
up
)
 
<EOS>
it
was
a
fiery
West
Indian
night
;
one
of
the
description
that
frequently
precede
the
hurricanes
of
those
climates
.
<EOS>
Being
unable
to
sleep
in
bed
,
I
got
up
and
opened
the
window
.
<EOS>
The
air
was
like
sulphur
-
steams
 
<EOS>
I
could
find
no
refreshment
anywhere
.
<EOS>
Mosquitoes
came
buzzing
in
and
hummed
sullenly
round
the
room
;
the
sea
,
which
I
could
hear
from
thence
,
rumbled
dull
like
an
earthquake
 
black
clouds
were
casting
up
over
it
;
the
moon
was
setting
in
the
waves
,
broad
and
red
,
like
a
hot
cannon
-
ball
 
<EOS>
she
threw
her
last
bloody
glance
over
a
world
quivering
with
the
ferment
of
tempest
.
<EOS>
I
was
physically
influenced
by
the
atmosphere
and
scene
,
and
my
ears
were
filled
with
the
curses
the
maniac
still
shrieked
out
;
wherein
she
momentarily
mingled
my
name
with
such
a
tone
of
demon
-
hate
,
with
such
language
!
 
<EOS>
no
professed
harlot
ever
had
a
fouler
vocabulary
than
she
:
<EOS>
though
two
rooms
off
,
I
heard
every
word
 
the
thin
partitions
of
the
West
India
house
opposing
but
slight
obstruction
to
her
wolfish
cries
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
This
life
,
"
said
I
at
last
,
"
is
hell
:
this
is
the
air
 
<EOS>
those
are
the
sounds
of
the
bottomless
pit
!
<EOS>
I
have
a
right
to
deliver
myself
from
it
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
The
sufferings
of
this
mortal
state
will
leave
me
with
the
heavy
flesh
that
now
cumbers
my
soul
.
<EOS>
Of
the
fanatic
's
burning
eternity
I
have
no
fear
:
there
is
not
a
future
state
worse
than
this
present
one
 
<EOS>
let
me
break
away
,
and
go
home
to
God
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
this
whilst
I
knelt
down
at
,
and
unlocked
a
trunk
which
contained
a
brace
of
loaded
pistols
:
I
mean
to
shoot
myself
.
<EOS>
I
only
entertained
the
intention
for
a
moment
;
for
,
not
being
insane
,
the
crisis
of
exquisite
and
unalloyed
despair
,
which
had
originated
the
wish
and
design
of
self
-
destruction
,
was
past
in
a
second
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
wind
fresh
from
Europe
blew
over
the
ocean
and
rushed
through
the
open
casement
:
the
storm
broke
,
streamed
,
thundered
,
blazed
,
and
<EOS>
the
air
grew
pure
.
<EOS>
I
then
framed
and
fixed
a
resolution
.
<EOS>
While
I
walked
under
the
dripping
orange
-
trees
of
my
wet
garden
,
and
amongst
its
drenched
pomegranates
and
pine
-
apples
,
and
while
the
refulgent
dawn
of
the
tropics
kindled
round
me
 
I
reasoned
thus
,
Jane
 
and
now
listen
;
for
it
was
true
Wisdom
that
consoled
me
in
that
hour
,
and
showed
me
the
right
path
to
follow
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
sweet
wind
from
Europe
was
still
whispering
in
the
refreshed
leaves
,
and
the
Atlantic
was
thundering
in
glorious
liberty
;
my
heart
,
dried
up
and
scorched
for
a
long
time
,
swelled
to
the
tone
,
and
filled
with
living
blood
 
my
being
longed
for
renewal
 
<EOS>
my
soul
thirsted
for
a
pure
draught
.
<EOS>
I
saw
hope
revive
 
and
felt
regeneration
possible
.
<EOS>
From
a
flowery
arch
at
the
bottom
of
my
garden
I
gazed
over
the
sea
 
bluer
than
the
sky
:
the
old
world
was
beyond
;
clear
prospects
opened
thus
:
    
"
"
Go
,
"
said
Hope
,
"
and
live
again
in
Europe
<EOS>
:
there
it
is
not
known
what
a
sullied
name
you
bear
,
nor
what
a
filthy
burden
is
bound
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
may
take
the
maniac
with
you
to
England
;
confine
her
with
due
attendance
and
precautions
at
Thornfield
:
then
travel
yourself
to
what
clime
you
will
,
and
form
what
new
tie
you
like
.
<EOS>
That
woman
,
who
has
so
abused
your
long-
suffering
,
so
sullied
your
name
,
so
outraged
your
honour
,
so
blighted
your
youth
,
is
not
your
wife
,
nor
are
you
her
husband
.
<EOS>
See
that
she
is
cared
for
as
her
condition
demands
,
and
you
have
done
all
that
God
and
humanity
require
of
you
.
<EOS>
Let
her
identity
,
her
connection
with
yourself
,
be
buried
in
oblivion
:
you
are
bound
to
impart
them
to
no
living
being
.
<EOS>
Place
her
in
safety
and
comfort
:
shelter
her
degradation
with
secrecy
,
and
leave
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
acted
precisely
on
this
suggestion
.
<EOS>
My
father
and
brother
had
not
made
my
marriage
known
to
their
acquaintance
;
because
,
in
the
very
first
letter
I
wrote
to
apprise
them
of
the
union
 
having
already
begun
to
experience
extreme
disgust
of
its
consequences
,
and
,
from
the
family
character
and
constitution
,
seeing
a
hideous
future
opening
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
added
an
urgent
charge
to
keep
it
secret
:
and
very
soon
the
infamous
conduct
of
the
wife
my
father
had
selected
for
me
was
such
as
to
make
him
blush
to
own
her
as
his
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
Far
from
desiring
to
publish
the
connection
,
he
became
as
anxious
to
conceal
it
as
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
England
,
then
,
I
conveyed
her
;
a
fearful
voyage
I
had
with
such
a
monster
in
the
vessel
.
<EOS>
Glad
was
I
when
I
at
last
got
her
to
Thornfield
,
and
saw
her
safely
lodged
in
that
third
-
storey
room
,
of
whose
secret
inner
cabinet
she
has
now
for
ten
years
made
a
wild
beast
's
den
 
a
goblin
's
cell
.
<EOS>
I
had
some
trouble
in
finding
an
attendant
for
her
,
as
it
was
necessary
to
select
one
on
whose
fidelity
dependence
could
be
placed
;
for
her
ravings
would
inevitably
betray
my
secret
:
besides
,
she
had
lucid
intervals
of
days
 
<EOS>
sometimes
weeks
 
which
she
filled
up
with
abuse
of
me
.
<EOS>
At
last
I
hired
Grace
Poole
from
the
Grimbsy
Retreat
.
<EOS>
She
and
the
surgeon
,
Carter
(
who
dressed
Mason
's
wounds
<EOS>
that
night
he
was
stabbed
and
worried
)
,
are
the
only
two
I
have
ever
admitted
to
my
confidence
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
may
indeed
have
suspected
something
,
but
she
could
have
gained
no
precise
knowledge
as
to
facts
.
<EOS>
Grace
has
,
on
the
whole
,
proved
a
good
keeper
;
though
,
owing
partly
to
a
fault
of
her
own
,
of
which
it
appears
nothing
can
cure
her
,
and
which
is
incident
to
her
harassing
profession
,
her
vigilance
has
been
more
than
once
lulled
and
baffled
.
<EOS>
The
lunatic
is
both
cunning
and
malignant
;
she
has
never
failed
to
take
advantage
of
her
guardian
's
temporary
lapses
;
once
to
secrete
the
knife
with
which
she
stabbed
her
brother
,
and
twice
to
possess
herself
of
the
key
of
her
cell
,
and
issue
therefrom
in
the
night
-
time
.
<EOS>
On
the
first
of
these
occasions
,
she
perpetrated
the
attempt
to
burn
me
in
my
bed
;
on
the
second
,
she
paid
that
ghastly
visit
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
thank
Providence
,
who
watched
over
you
,
that
she
then
spent
her
fury
on
your
wedding
apparel
,
which
perhaps
brought
back
vague
reminiscences
of
her
own
bridal
days
:
<EOS>
but
on
what
might
have
happened
,
I
can
not
endure
to
reflect
.
<EOS>
When
I
think
of
the
thing
which
flew
at
my
throat
this
morning
,
hanging
its
black
and
scarlet
visage
over
the
nest
of
my
dove
,
my
blood
curdles
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
what
,
sir
,
"
I
asked
,
while
he
paused
,
"
did
you
do
when
you
had
settled
her
here
?
<EOS>
Where
did
you
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
I
do
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
I
transformed
myself
into
a
will
-
o'-the
-
wisp
.
<EOS>
Where
did
I
go
?
<EOS>
I
pursued
wanderings
as
wild
as
those
of
the
March
-
spirit
.
<EOS>
I
sought
the
Continent
,
and
went
devious
through
all
its
lands
.
<EOS>
My
fixed
desire
was
to
seek
and
find
a
good
and
intelligent
woman
,
whom
I
could
love
:
a
contrast
to
the
fury
I
left
at
Thornfield
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
could
not
marry
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
determined
and
was
convinced
that
I
could
and
ought
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
my
original
intention
to
deceive
,
as
I
have
deceived
you
.
<EOS>
I
meant
to
tell
my
tale
plainly
,
and
make
my
proposals
openly
:
and
it
appeared
to
me
so
absolutely
rational
that
I
should
be
considered
free
to
love
and
be
loved
,
I
never
doubted
some
woman
might
be
found
willing
and
able
to
understand
my
case
and
accept
me
,
in
spite
of
the
curse
with
which
I
was
burdened
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
are
inquisitive
,
Jane
,
you
always
make
me
smile
.
<EOS>
You
open
your
eyes
like
an
eager
bird
,
and
make
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
restless
movement
,
as
if
answers
in
speech
did
not
flow
fast
enough
for
you
,
and
you
wanted
to
read
the
tablet
of
one
's
heart
.
<EOS>
But
before
I
go
on
,
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
your
"
Well
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
small
phrase
very
frequent
with
you
;
and
which
many
a
time
has
drawn
me
on
and
on
through
interminable
talk
:
I
do
n't
very
well
know
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
 
What
next
?
<EOS>
How
did
you
proceed
?
<EOS>
What
came
of
such
an
event
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Precisely
!
<EOS>
and
what
do
you
wish
to
know
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whether
you
found
any
one
you
liked
:
whether
you
asked
her
to
marry
you
;
and
what
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
can
tell
you
whether
I
found
any
one
I
liked
,
and
whether
I
asked
her
to
marry
me
:
but
what
she
said
is
yet
to
be
recorded
in
the
book
of
Fate
.
<EOS>
For
ten
long
years
I
roved
about
,
living
first
in
one
capital
,
then
another
:
sometimes
in
St.
Petersburg
;
oftener
in
Paris
;
occasionally
in
Rome
,
Naples
,
and
Florence
.
<EOS>
Provided
with
plenty
of
money
and
the
passport
of
an
old
name
,
I
could
choose
my
own
society
:
no
circles
were
closed
against
me
.
<EOS>
I
sought
my
ideal
of
a
woman
amongst
English
ladies
,
French
countesses
,
Italian
signoras
,
and
German
grafinnen
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
find
her
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
for
a
fleeting
moment
,
I
thought
I
caught
a
glance
,
heard
a
tone
,
beheld
a
form
,
which
announced
the
realisation
of
my
dream
:
<EOS>
but
I
was
presently
undeserved
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
to
suppose
that
I
desired
perfection
,
either
of
mind
or
person
.
<EOS>
I
longed
only
for
what
suited
me
 
for
the
antipodes
of
the
Creole
:
and
I
longed
vainly
.
<EOS>
Amongst
them
all
I
found
not
one
whom
,
had
I
been
ever
so
free
<EOS>
,
I
 
warned
as
I
was
of
the
risks
,
the
horrors
,
the
loathings
of
incongruous
unions
 
would
have
asked
to
marry
me
.
<EOS>
Disappointment
made
me
reckless
.
<EOS>
I
tried
dissipation
 
never
debauchery
:
that
I
hated
,
and
hate
.
<EOS>
That
was
my
Indian
Messalina
's
attribute
:
rooted
disgust
at
it
and
<EOS>
her
restrained
me
much
,
even
in
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Any
enjoyment
that
bordered
on
riot
seemed
to
approach
me
to
her
and
her
vices
,
and
I
eschewed
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
I
could
not
live
alone
;
so
I
tried
the
companionship
of
mistresses
.
<EOS>
The
first
I
chose
was
Celine
Varens
 
another
of
those
steps
which
make
a
man
spurn
himself
when
he
recalls
them
.
<EOS>
You
already
know
what
she
was
,
and
how
my
liaison
with
her
terminated
.
<EOS>
She
had
two
successors
:
an
Italian
,
Giacinta
,
and
a
German
,
Clara
;
<EOS>
both
considered
singularly
handsome
.
<EOS>
What
was
their
beauty
to
me
in
a
few
weeks
?
<EOS>
Giacinta
was
unprincipled
and
violent
:
I
tired
of
her
in
three
months
.
<EOS>
Clara
was
honest
and
quiet
;
but
heavy
,
mindless
,
and
unimpressible
:
not
one
whit
to
my
taste
.
<EOS>
I
was
glad
to
give
her
a
sufficient
sum
to
set
her
up
in
a
good
line
of
business
,
and
so
get
decently
rid
of
her
.
<EOS>
But
,
Jane
,
I
see
by
your
face
you
are
not
forming
a
very
favourable
opinion
of
me
just
now
.
<EOS>
You
think
me
an
unfeeling
,
loose
-
principled
rake
:
do
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
you
so
well
as
I
have
done
sometimes
,
indeed
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Did
it
not
seem
to
you
in
the
least
wrong
to
live
in
that
way
,
first
with
one
mistress
and
then
another
?
<EOS>
You
talk
of
it
as
a
mere
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
with
me
;
and
I
did
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
grovelling
fashion
of
existence
:
I
should
never
like
to
return
to
it
.
<EOS>
Hiring
a
mistress
is
the
next
worse
thing
to
buying
a
slave
:
both
are
often
by
nature
,
and
always
by
position
,
inferior
:
and
to
live
familiarly
with
inferiors
is
degrading
.
<EOS>
I
now
hate
the
recollection
of
the
time
I
passed
with
Celine
,
Giacinta
,
and
Clara
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
felt
the
truth
of
these
words
;
and
I
drew
from
them
the
certain
inference
,
that
if
I
were
so
far
to
forget
myself
and
all
the
teaching
that
had
ever
been
instilled
into
me
,
as
 
under
any
pretext
 
with
any
justification
 
through
any
temptation
 
to
become
the
successor
of
these
poor
girls
,
he
would
one
day
regard
me
with
the
same
feeling
which
now
in
his
mind
desecrated
their
memory
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
give
utterance
to
this
conviction
:
it
was
enough
to
feel
it
.
<EOS>
I
impressed
it
on
my
heart
,
that
it
might
remain
there
to
serve
me
as
aid
in
the
time
of
trial
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Jane
,
why
do
n't
you
say
"
Well
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
done
.
<EOS>
You
are
looking
grave
.
<EOS>
You
disapprove
of
me
still
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
But
let
me
come
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
Last
January
,
rid
of
all
mistresses
 
in
a
harsh
,
bitter
frame
of
mind
,
the
result
of
a
useless
,
roving
,
lonely
life
 
corroded
with
disappointment
,
sourly
disposed
against
all
men
,
and
especially
against
all
womankind
(
for
I
began
to
regard
the
notion
of
an
intellectual
,
faithful
,
loving
woman
as
a
mere
dream
)
,
recalled
by
business
<EOS>
,
I
came
back
to
England
.
  
<EOS>
"
On
a
frosty
winter
afternoon
,
I
rode
in
sight
of
Thornfield
Hall
.
<EOS>
Abhorred
spot
!
<EOS>
I
expected
no
peace
 
no
pleasure
there
.
<EOS>
On
a
stile
in
Hay
Lane
I
saw
a
quiet
little
figure
sitting
by
itself
.
<EOS>
I
passed
it
as
negligently
as
I
did
the
pollard
willow
opposite
to
it
:
I
had
no
presentiment
of
what
it
would
be
to
me
;
no
inward
warning
that
the
arbitress
of
my
life
 
my
genius
for
good
or
evil
 
waited
there
in
humble
guise
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
it
,
even
when
,
on
the
occasion
of
Mesrour
's
accident
,
it
came
up
and
gravely
offered
me
help
.
<EOS>
Childish
and
slender
creature
!
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
a
linnet
had
hopped
to
my
foot
and
proposed
to
bear
me
on
its
tiny
wing
.
<EOS>
I
was
surly
;
but
the
thing
would
not
go
:
it
stood
by
me
with
strange
perseverance
,
and
looked
and
spoke
with
a
sort
of
authority
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
aided
,
and
by
that
hand
:
and
aided
I
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
once
I
had
pressed
the
frail
shoulder
,
something
new
 
a
fresh
sap
and
sense
 
stole
into
my
frame
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
<EOS>
I
had
learnt
that
this
elf
must
return
to
me
 
that
it
belonged
to
my
house
down
below
 
<EOS>
or
I
could
not
have
felt
it
pass
away
from
under
my
hand
,
and
seen
it
vanish
behind
the
dim
hedge
,
without
singular
regret
.
<EOS>
I
heard
you
come
home
that
night
,
Jane
,
though
probably
you
were
not
aware
that
I
thought
of
you
or
watched
for
you
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
I
observed
you
 
myself
unseen
 
for
half
-
an-
hour
,
while
you
played
with
Adele
in
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
snowy
day
,
I
recollect
,
and
you
could
not
go
out
of
doors
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
my
room
;
the
door
was
ajar
:
I
could
both
listen
and
watch
.
<EOS>
Adele
claimed
your
outward
attention
for
a
while
;
yet
I
fancied
your
thoughts
were
elsewhere
:
but
you
were
very
patient
with
her
,
my
little
Jane
;
you
talked
to
her
and
amused
her
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
When
at
last
she
left
you
,
you
lapsed
at
once
into
deep
reverie
:
you
betook
yourself
slowly
to
pace
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
Now
and
then
,
in
passing
a
casement
,
you
glanced
out
at
the
thick
-
falling
snow
;
you
listened
to
the
sobbing
wind
,
and
again
you
paced
gently
on
and
dreamed
.
<EOS>
I
think
those
day
visions
were
not
dark
:
there
was
a
pleasurable
illumination
in
your
eye
occasionally
,
a
soft
excitement
in
your
aspect
,
which
told
of
no
bitter
,
bilious
,
hypochondriac
brooding
:
<EOS>
your
look
revealed
rather
the
sweet
musings
of
youth
when
its
spirit
follows
on
willing
wings
the
flight
of
Hope
up
and
on
to
an
ideal
heaven
.
<EOS>
The
voice
of
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
speaking
to
a
servant
in
the
hall
,
wakened
you
:
and
how
curiously
you
smiled
to
and
at
yourself
,
Janet
!
<EOS>
There
was
much
sense
in
your
smile
:
it
was
very
shrewd
,
and
seemed
to
make
light
of
your
own
abstraction
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
say
 
"
My
fine
visions
are
all
very
well
,
but
I
must
not
forget
they
are
absolutely
unreal
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
rosy
sky
and
a
green
flowery
Eden
in
my
brain
;
but
without
,
I
am
perfectly
aware
,
lies
at
my
feet
a
rough
tract
to
travel
,
and
around
me
gather
black
tempests
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
"
You
ran
downstairs
and
demanded
of
Mrs.
Fairfax
some
occupation
:
the
weekly
house
accounts
to
make
up
,
or
something
of
that
sort
,
I
think
it
was
.
<EOS>
I
was
vexed
with
you
for
getting
out
of
my
sight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Impatiently
I
waited
for
evening
,
when
I
might
summon
you
to
my
presence
.
<EOS>
An
unusual
 
to
me
 
a
perfectly
new
character
I
suspected
was
yours
:
<EOS>
I
desired
to
search
it
deeper
and
know
it
better
.
<EOS>
You
entered
the
room
with
a
look
and
air
at
once
shy
and
independent
:
you
were
quaintly
dressed
 
much
as
you
are
now
.
<EOS>
I
made
you
talk
:
<EOS>
ere
long
I
found
you
full
of
strange
contrasts
.
<EOS>
Your
garb
and
manner
were
restricted
by
rule
;
your
air
was
often
diffident
,
and
altogether
that
of
one
refined
by
nature
,
but
absolutely
unused
to
society
,
and
a
good
deal
afraid
of
making
herself
disadvantageously
conspicuous
by
some
solecism
or
blunder
;
yet
when
addressed
,
you
lifted
a
keen
,
a
daring
,
and
a
glowing
eye
to
your
interlocutor
's
face
:
<EOS>
there
was
penetration
and
power
in
each
glance
you
gave
;
when
plied
by
close
questions
,
you
found
ready
and
round
answers
.
<EOS>
Very
soon
you
seemed
to
get
used
to
me
:
<EOS>
I
believe
you
felt
the
existence
of
sympathy
between
you
and
your
grim
and
cross
master
,
Jane
;
for
it
was
astonishing
to
see
how
quickly
a
certain
pleasant
ease
tranquillised
your
manner
:
<EOS>
snarl
as
I
would
<EOS>
,
you
showed
no
surprise
,
fear
,
annoyance
,
or
displeasure
at
my
moroseness
;
you
watched
me
,
and
now
and
then
smiled
at
me
with
a
simple
yet
sagacious
grace
I
can
not
describe
.
<EOS>
I
was
at
once
content
and
stimulated
with
what
I
saw
:
I
liked
what
I
had
seen
,
and
wished
to
see
more
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
for
a
long
time
,
I
treated
you
distantly
,
and
sought
your
company
rarely
.
<EOS>
I
was
an
intellectual
epicure
,
and
wished
to
prolong
the
gratification
of
making
this
novel
and
piquant
acquaintance
:
besides
,
I
was
for
a
while
troubled
with
a
haunting
fear
that
if
I
handled
the
flower
freely
its
bloom
would
fade
 
the
sweet
charm
of
freshness
would
leave
it
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
then
know
that
it
was
no
transitory
blossom
,
but
rather
the
radiant
resemblance
of
one
,
cut
in
an
indestructible
gem
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
I
wished
to
see
whether
you
would
seek
me
if
I
shunned
you
 
<EOS>
but
you
did
not
;
you
kept
in
the
schoolroom
as
still
as
your
own
desk
and
easel
;
if
by
chance
I
met
you
,
you
passed
me
as
soon
,
and
with
as
little
token
of
recognition
,
as
was
consistent
with
respect
.
<EOS>
Your
habitual
expression
in
those
days
,
Jane
,
was
a
thoughtful
look
;
not
despondent
,
for
you
were
not
sickly
;
but
not
buoyant
,
<EOS>
for
you
had
little
hope
,
and
no
actual
pleasure
.
<EOS>
I
wondered
what
you
thought
of
me
,
or
if
you
ever
thought
of
me
,
and
resolved
to
find
this
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
resumed
my
notice
of
you
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
glad
in
your
glance
,
and
genial
in
your
manner
,
when
you
conversed
:
I
saw
you
had
a
social
heart
;
it
was
the
silent
schoolroom
 
<EOS>
it
was
the
tedium
of
your
life
 
that
made
you
mournful
.
<EOS>
I
permitted
myself
the
delight
of
being
kind
to
you
;
kindness
stirred
emotion
soon
:
<EOS>
your
face
became
soft
in
expression
,
your
tones
gentle
;
I
liked
my
name
pronounced
by
your
lips
in
a
grateful
happy
accent
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
enjoy
a
chance
meeting
with
you
,
Jane
,
at
this
time
:
there
was
a
curious
hesitation
in
your
manner
:
you
glanced
at
me
with
a
slight
trouble
 
a
hovering
doubt
:
you
did
not
know
what
my
caprice
might
be
 
whether
I
was
going
to
play
the
master
and
be
stern
,
or
the
friend
and
be
benignant
.
<EOS>
I
was
now
too
fond
of
you
often
to
simulate
the
first
whim
;
and
,
when
I
stretched
my
hand
out
cordially
,
such
bloom
and
light
and
bliss
rose
to
your
young
,
wistful
features
<EOS>
,
I
had
much
ado
often
to
avoid
straining
you
then
and
there
to
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
any
more
of
those
days
,
sir
,
"
I
interrupted
,
furtively
dashing
away
some
tears
from
my
eyes
;
his
language
was
torture
to
me
;
for
I
knew
what
I
must
do
 
and
do
soon
 
and
all
these
reminiscences
,
and
these
revelations
of
his
feelings
only
made
my
work
more
difficult
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Jane
,
"
he
returned
:
"
what
necessity
is
there
to
dwell
on
the
Past
,
when
the
Present
is
so
much
surer
 
the
Future
so
much
brighter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
shuddered
to
hear
the
infatuated
assertion
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
now
how
the
case
stands
 
<EOS>
do
you
not
?
"
<EOS>
he
continued
.
<EOS>
"
After
a
youth
and
manhood
passed
half
in
unutterable
misery
and
half
in
dreary
solitude
,
I
have
for
the
first
time
found
what
I
can
truly
love
 
<EOS>
I
have
found
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
my
sympathy
 
<EOS>
my
better
self
 
<EOS>
my
good
angel
.
<EOS>
I
am
bound
to
you
with
a
strong
attachment
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
good
,
gifted
,
<EOS>
lovely
:
a
fervent
<EOS>
,
a
solemn
passion
is
conceived
in
my
heart
;
it
leans
to
you
,
draws
you
to
my
centre
and
spring
of
life
,
wraps
my
existence
about
you
,
and
,
kindling
in
pure
,
powerful
flame
,
fuses
you
and
me
in
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
because
I
felt
and
knew
this
,
that
I
resolved
to
marry
you
.
<EOS>
To
tell
me
that
I
had
already
<EOS>
a
wife
is
empty
mockery
:
you
know
now
that
I
had
but
<EOS>
a
hideous
demon
.
<EOS>
I
was
wrong
to
attempt
to
deceive
you
;
but
I
feared
a
stubbornness
that
exists
in
your
character
.
<EOS>
I
feared
early
instilled
prejudice
:
I
wanted
to
have
you
safe
before
hazarding
confidences
.
<EOS>
This
was
cowardly
:
I
should
have
appealed
to
your
nobleness
and
magnanimity
at
first
,
as
I
do
now
 
opened
to
you
plainly
<EOS>
my
life
of
agony
 
described
to
you
my
hunger
and
thirst
after
a
higher
and
worthier
existence
 
shown
to
you
,
not
my
_
resolution
_
(
that
word
is
weak
)
,
but
my
resistless
_
bent
_
to
love
faithfully
and
well
,
where
I
am
faithfully
and
well
loved
in
return
.
<EOS>
Then
I
should
have
asked
you
to
accept
my
pledge
of
fidelity
and
to
give
me
yours
.
<EOS>
Jane
 
give
it
me
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
silent
,
Jane
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
experiencing
an
ordeal
:
a
hand
of
fiery
iron
grasped
my
vitals
.
<EOS>
Terrible
moment
:
full
of
struggle
,
blackness
,
burning
!
<EOS>
Not
a
human
being
that
ever
lived
could
wish
to
be
loved
better
than
I
was
loved
;
and
him
who
thus
loved
me
I
absolutely
worshipped
:
and
I
must
renounce
love
and
idol
.
<EOS>
One
drear
word
comprised
my
intolerable
duty
 
"
Depart
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
you
understand
what
I
want
of
you
?
<EOS>
Just
this
promise
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
yours
,
Mr.
Rochester
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
,
I
will
_
not
_
be
yours
.
"
  
<EOS>
Another
long
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
!
"
<EOS>
recommenced
he
,
with
a
gentleness
that
broke
me
down
with
grief
,
and
turned
me
stone
-
cold
with
ominous
terror
 
for
this
still
voice
was
the
pant
of
a
lion
rising
 
"
Jane
,
do
you
mean
to
go
one
way
in
the
world
,
and
to
let
me
go
another
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Jane
"
(
bending
towards
and
embracing
me
)
,
"
<EOS>
do
you
mean
it
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
now
?
"
softly
kissing
my
forehead
and
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
extricating
myself
from
restraint
rapidly
and
completely
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Jane
,
this
is
bitter
!
<EOS>
This
 
this
is
wicked
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
wicked
to
love
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
to
obey
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
wild
look
raised
his
brows
 
<EOS>
crossed
his
features
<EOS>
:
he
rose
;
but
he
forebore
yet
.
<EOS>
I
laid
my
hand
on
the
back
of
a
chair
for
support
:
<EOS>
I
shook
,
I
feared
 
but
I
resolved
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
instant
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
Give
one
glance
to
my
horrible
life
when
you
are
gone
.
<EOS>
All
happiness
will
be
torn
away
with
you
.
<EOS>
What
then
is
left
?
<EOS>
For
a
wife
I
have
but
the
maniac
upstairs
:
as
well
might
you
refer
me
to
some
corpse
in
yonder
churchyard
.
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
Where
turn
for
a
companion
and
for
some
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
as
I
do
:
trust
in
God
and
yourself
.
<EOS>
Believe
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
Hope
to
meet
again
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
will
not
yield
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
condemn
me
to
live
wretched
and
to
die
accursed
?
"
<EOS>
His
voice
rose
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
advise
you
to
live
sinless
,
and
I
wish
you
to
die
tranquil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
snatch
love
and
innocence
from
me
?
<EOS>
You
fling
me
back
on
lust
for
a
passion
 
vice
for
an
occupation
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rochester
,
I
no
more
assign
this
fate
to
you
than
I
grasp
at
it
for
myself
.
<EOS>
We
were
born
to
strive
and
endure
 
you
as
well
as
I
:
do
so
.
<EOS>
You
will
forget
me
before
I
forget
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
make
me
a
liar
by
such
language
:
you
sully
my
honour
.
<EOS>
I
declared
I
could
not
change
:
you
tell
me
to
my
face
I
shall
change
soon
.
<EOS>
And
what
a
distortion
in
your
judgment
,
what
a
perversity
in
your
ideas
,
is
proved
by
your
conduct
!
<EOS>
Is
it
better
to
drive
a
fellow
-
creature
to
despair
than
to
transgress
a
mere
human
law
,
no
man
being
injured
by
the
breach
?
<EOS>
for
you
have
neither
relatives
nor
acquaintances
whom
you
need
fear
to
offend
by
living
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
true
:
and
while
he
spoke
my
very
conscience
and
reason
turned
traitors
against
me
,
and
charged
me
with
crime
in
resisting
him
.
<EOS>
They
spoke
almost
as
loud
as
Feeling
:
and
that
clamoured
wildly
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
comply
!
"
<EOS>
it
said
.
<EOS>
"
Think
of
his
misery
;
think
of
his
danger
 
look
at
his
state
when
left
alone
;
remember
his
headlong
nature
;
consider
the
recklessness
following
on
despair
 
<EOS>
soothe
him
;
save
him
;
love
him
;
tell
him
you
love
him
and
will
be
his
.
<EOS>
Who
in
the
world
cares
for
_
you
<EOS>
_
?
<EOS>
or
who
will
be
injured
by
what
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Still
indomitable
was
the
reply
 
"
_
<EOS>
I
_
care
for
myself
.
<EOS>
The
more
solitary
,
the
more
friendless
,
the
more
unsustained
I
am
,
the
more
I
will
respect
myself
.
<EOS>
I
will
keep
the
law
given
by
God
;
sanctioned
by
man
.
<EOS>
I
will
hold
to
the
principles
received
by
me
when
I
was
sane
,
and
not
mad
 
as
I
am
now
.
<EOS>
Laws
and
principles
are
not
for
the
times
when
there
is
no
temptation
:
they
are
for
such
moments
as
this
,
when
body
and
soul
rise
in
mutiny
against
their
rigour
;
stringent
are
they
;
inviolate
they
shall
be
.
<EOS>
If
at
my
individual
convenience
I
might
break
them
,
what
would
be
their
worth
?
<EOS>
They
have
a
worth
 
<EOS>
so
I
have
always
believed
;
and
if
I
can
not
believe
it
now
,
it
is
because
I
am
insane
 
<EOS>
quite
insane
:
with
my
veins
running
fire
,
and
my
heart
beating
faster
than
I
can
count
its
throbs
.
<EOS>
Preconceived
opinions
,
foregone
determinations
,
are
all
I
have
at
this
hour
to
stand
by
:
there
I
plant
my
foot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
,
reading
my
countenance
,
saw
I
had
done
so
.
<EOS>
His
fury
was
wrought
to
the
highest
:
he
must
yield
to
it
for
a
moment
,
whatever
followed
;
he
crossed
the
floor
and
seized
my
arm
and
grasped
my
waist
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
devour
me
with
his
flaming
glance
:
<EOS>
physically
,
I
felt
,
at
the
moment
,
powerless
as
stubble
exposed
to
the
draught
and
glow
of
a
furnace
:
mentally
,
I
still
possessed
my
soul
,
and
with
it
the
certainty
of
ultimate
safety
.
<EOS>
The
soul
,
fortunately
,
has
an
interpreter
 
often
an
unconscious
,
but
still
a
truthful
interpreter
 
in
the
eye
.
<EOS>
My
eye
rose
to
his
;
and
while
I
looked
in
his
fierce
face
I
gave
an
involuntary
sigh
;
his
gripe
was
painful
,
and
my
over
-
taxed
strength
almost
exhausted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
said
he
,
as
he
ground
his
teeth
,
"
never
was
anything
at
once
so
frail
and
so
indomitable
.
<EOS>
A
mere
reed
she
feels
in
my
hand
!
"
<EOS>
(
And
he
shook
me
with
the
force
of
his
hold
.
)
<EOS>
"
I
could
bend
her
with
my
finger
and
thumb
:
and
what
good
would
it
do
if
I
bent
,
if
I
uptore
,
if
I
crushed
her
?
<EOS>
Consider
that
eye
:
consider
the
resolute
,
wild
,
free
thing
looking
out
of
it
,
defying
me
,
with
more
than
courage
 
with
a
stern
triumph
.
<EOS>
Whatever
I
do
with
its
cage
,
I
can
not
get
at
it
 
<EOS>
the
savage
,
beautiful
creature
!
<EOS>
If
I
tear
,
if
I
rend
the
slight
prison
,
my
outrage
will
only
let
the
captive
loose
.
<EOS>
Conqueror
I
might
be
of
the
house
;
but
the
inmate
would
escape
to
heaven
before
I
could
call
myself
possessor
of
its
clay
dwelling
-
place
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
you
,
spirit
 
with
will
and
energy
,
and
virtue
and
purity
 
that
I
want
:
not
alone
your
brittle
frame
.
<EOS>
Of
yourself
you
could
come
with
soft
flight
and
nestle
against
my
heart
,
if
you
would
:
seized
against
your
will
,
you
will
elude
the
grasp
like
an
essence
 
you
will
vanish
ere
<EOS>
I
inhale
your
fragrance
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
come
,
Jane
,
come
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
,
he
released
me
from
his
clutch
,
and
only
looked
at
me
.
<EOS>
The
look
was
far
worse
to
resist
than
the
frantic
strain
:
only
an
idiot
,
however
,
would
have
succumbed
now
.
<EOS>
I
had
dared
and
baffled
his
fury
;
I
must
elude
his
sorrow
<EOS>
:
I
retired
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
going
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
leaving
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
come
?
<EOS>
You
will
not
be
my
comforter
,
my
rescuer
?
<EOS>
My
deep
love
,
my
wild
woe
,
my
frantic
prayer
,
are
all
nothing
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
What
unutterable
pathos
was
in
his
voice
!
<EOS>
How
hard
it
was
to
reiterate
firmly
,
"
I
am
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Jane
!
"
  
"
Mr.
Rochester
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Withdraw
,
then
,
 
I
consent
;
but
remember
,
you
leave
me
here
in
anguish
.
<EOS>
Go
up
to
your
own
room
;
think
over
all
I
have
said
,
and
,
Jane
,
cast
a
glance
on
my
sufferings
 
think
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
turned
away
;
he
threw
himself
on
his
face
on
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Jane
!
<EOS>
my
hope
 
<EOS>
my
love
 
my
life
!
"
<EOS>
broke
in
anguish
from
his
lips
.
<EOS>
Then
came
a
deep
,
strong
sob
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
already
gained
the
door
;
but
,
reader
,
I
walked
back
 
walked
back
as
determinedly
as
I
had
retreated
.
<EOS>
I
knelt
down
by
him
;
I
turned
his
face
from
the
cushion
to
me
;
I
kissed
his
cheek
;
I
smoothed
his
hair
with
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
my
dear
master
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
God
keep
you
from
harm
and
wrong
 
direct
you
,
solace
you
 
<EOS>
reward
you
well
for
your
past
kindness
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Little
Jane
's
love
would
have
been
my
best
reward
,
"
he
answered
;
"
without
it
,
my
heart
is
broken
.
<EOS>
But
Jane
will
give
me
her
love
:
<EOS>
yes
 
nobly
,
generously
.
"
  
<EOS>
Up
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
;
forth
flashed
the
fire
from
his
eyes
;
erect
he
sprang
;
he
held
his
arms
out
;
but
I
evaded
the
embrace
,
and
at
once
quitted
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Farewell
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
cry
of
my
heart
as
I
left
him
.
<EOS>
Despair
added
,
"
Farewell
for
ever
!
"
     
<EOS>
That
night
I
never
thought
to
sleep
;
but
a
slumber
fell
on
me
as
soon
as
I
lay
down
in
bed
.
<EOS>
I
was
transported
in
thought
to
the
scenes
of
childhood
:
<EOS>
I
dreamt
<EOS>
I
lay
in
the
red
-
room
at
Gateshead
;
that
the
night
was
dark
,
and
my
mind
impressed
with
strange
fears
.
<EOS>
The
light
that
long
ago
had
struck
me
into
syncope
,
recalled
in
this
vision
,
seemed
glidingly
to
mount
the
wall
,
and
tremblingly
to
pause
in
the
centre
of
the
obscured
ceiling
.
<EOS>
I
lifted
up
my
head
to
look
:
the
roof
resolved
to
clouds
,
high
and
dim
;
the
gleam
was
such
as
the
moon
imparts
to
vapours
<EOS>
she
is
about
to
sever
.
<EOS>
I
watched
her
come
 
watched
with
the
strangest
anticipation
;
as
though
some
word
of
doom
were
to
be
written
on
her
disk
.
<EOS>
She
broke
forth
as
never
moon
yet
burst
from
cloud
:
a
hand
first
penetrated
the
sable
folds
and
waved
them
away
;
then
,
not
a
moon
,
but
a
white
human
form
shone
in
the
azure
,
inclining
a
glorious
brow
earthward
.
<EOS>
It
gazed
and
gazed
on
me
.
<EOS>
It
spoke
to
my
spirit
:
<EOS>
immeasurably
distant
was
the
tone
,
yet
so
near
,
it
whispered
in
my
heart
    
"
My
daughter
,
flee
temptation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
I
answered
after
I
had
waked
from
the
trance
-
like
dream
.
<EOS>
It
was
yet
night
,
but
July
nights
are
short
:
soon
after
midnight
,
dawn
comes
.
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
too
early
to
commence
the
task
I
have
to
fulfil
,
"
thought
I.
I
rose
:
<EOS>
I
was
dressed
;
for
I
had
taken
off
nothing
but
my
shoes
.
<EOS>
I
knew
where
to
find
in
my
drawers
some
linen
,
a
locket
,
a
ring
.
<EOS>
In
seeking
these
articles
,
I
encountered
the
beads
of
a
pearl
necklace
Mr.
Rochester
had
forced
me
to
accept
a
few
days
ago
.
<EOS>
I
left
that
;
it
was
not
mine
:
<EOS>
it
was
the
visionary
bride
's
who
had
melted
in
air
.
<EOS>
The
other
articles
I
made
up
in
a
parcel
;
my
purse
,
containing
twenty
shillings
(
it
was
all
I
had
)
,
I
put
in
my
pocket
:
<EOS>
I
tied
on
my
straw
bonnet
,
pinned
my
shawl
,
took
the
parcel
and
my
slippers
,
which
I
would
not
put
on
yet
,
and
stole
from
my
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
kind
Mrs.
Fairfax
!
<EOS>
"
I
whispered
,
as
I
glided
past
her
door
.
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
my
darling
Adele
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
as
I
glanced
towards
the
nursery
.
<EOS>
No
thought
could
be
admitted
of
entering
to
embrace
her
.
<EOS>
I
had
to
deceive
a
fine
ear
:
<EOS>
for
aught
I
knew
it
might
now
be
listening
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
got
past
Mr.
Rochester
's
chamber
without
a
pause
;
but
my
heart
momentarily
stopping
its
beat
at
that
threshold
,
my
foot
was
forced
to
stop
also
.
<EOS>
No
sleep
was
there
:
the
inmate
was
walking
restlessly
from
wall
to
wall
;
and
again
and
again
he
sighed
while
I
listened
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
heaven
 
<EOS>
a
temporary
heaven
 
in
this
room
for
me
<EOS>
,
if
I
chose
:
I
had
but
to
go
in
and
to
say
    
"
Mr.
Rochester
,
I
will
love
you
and
live
with
you
through
life
till
death
,
"
and
a
fount
of
rapture
would
spring
to
my
lips
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
this
.
  
<EOS>
That
kind
master
,
who
could
not
sleep
now
,
was
waiting
with
impatience
for
day
.
<EOS>
He
would
send
for
me
in
the
morning
;
I
should
be
gone
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
me
sought
for
:
vainly
.
<EOS>
He
would
feel
himself
forsaken
;
his
love
rejected
:
he
would
suffer
;
perhaps
grow
desperate
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
this
too
.
<EOS>
My
hand
moved
towards
the
lock
:
I
caught
it
back
,
and
glided
on
.
  
<EOS>
Drearily
I
wound
my
way
downstairs
<EOS>
:
I
knew
what
I
had
to
do
,
and
I
did
it
mechanically
.
<EOS>
I
sought
the
key
of
the
side
-
door
in
the
kitchen
;
I
sought
,
too
,
a
phial
of
oil
and
a
feather
;
I
oiled
the
key
and
the
lock
.
<EOS>
I
got
some
water
<EOS>
,
I
got
some
bread
:
for
perhaps
I
should
have
to
walk
far
;
and
my
strength
,
sorely
shaken
of
late
,
must
not
break
down
.
<EOS>
All
this
I
did
without
one
sound
.
<EOS>
I
opened
the
door
,
passed
out
,
shut
it
softly
.
<EOS>
Dim
dawn
glimmered
in
the
yard
.
<EOS>
The
great
gates
were
closed
and
locked
;
but
a
wicket
in
one
of
them
was
only
latched
.
<EOS>
Through
that
I
departed
:
it
,
too
,
I
shut
;
and
now
I
was
out
of
Thornfield
.
  
<EOS>
A
mile
off
,
beyond
the
fields
,
lay
a
road
which
stretched
in
the
contrary
direction
to
Millcote
;
a
road
I
had
never
travelled
,
but
often
noticed
,
and
wondered
where
it
led
:
thither
I
bent
my
steps
.
<EOS>
No
reflection
was
to
be
allowed
now
:
not
one
glance
was
to
be
cast
back
;
not
even
one
forward
.
<EOS>
Not
one
thought
was
to
be
given
either
to
the
past
or
the
future
.
<EOS>
The
first
was
a
page
so
heavenly
sweet
 
<EOS>
so
deadly
sad
 
<EOS>
that
to
read
one
line
of
it
would
dissolve
my
courage
and
break
down
my
energy
.
<EOS>
The
last
was
an
awful
blank
:
something
like
the
world
when
the
deluge
was
gone
by
.
  
<EOS>
I
skirted
fields
,
and
hedges
,
and
lanes
till
after
sunrise
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
was
a
lovely
summer
morning
:
<EOS>
I
know
my
shoes
,
which
I
had
put
on
when
I
left
the
house
,
were
soon
wet
with
dew
.
<EOS>
But
I
looked
neither
to
rising
sun
,
nor
smiling
sky
,
nor
wakening
nature
.
<EOS>
He
who
is
taken
out
to
pass
through
a
fair
scene
to
the
scaffold
,
thinks
not
of
the
flowers
that
smile
on
his
road
,
but
of
the
block
and
axe
-
edge
;
of
the
disseverment
of
bone
and
vein
;
of
the
grave
gaping
at
the
end
:
<EOS>
and
I
thought
of
drear
flight
and
homeless
wandering
 
<EOS>
and
oh
!
<EOS>
with
agony
I
thought
of
what
I
left
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
him
now
 
in
his
room
 
watching
the
sunrise
;
hoping
I
should
soon
come
to
say
I
would
stay
with
him
and
be
his
.
<EOS>
I
longed
to
be
his
;
I
panted
to
return
:
it
was
not
too
late
;
I
could
yet
spare
him
the
bitter
pang
of
bereavement
.
<EOS>
As
yet
my
flight
,
I
was
sure
,
was
undiscovered
.
<EOS>
I
could
go
back
and
be
his
comforter
 
<EOS>
his
pride
;
his
redeemer
from
misery
,
perhaps
from
ruin
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
fear
of
his
self
-
abandonment
 
far
worse
than
my
abandonment
 
<EOS>
how
it
goaded
me
!
<EOS>
It
was
a
barbed
arrow
-
head
in
my
breast
;
it
tore
me
when
I
tried
to
extract
it
;
it
sickened
me
when
remembrance
thrust
it
farther
in
.
<EOS>
Birds
began
singing
in
brake
and
copse
:
birds
were
faithful
to
their
mates
;
birds
were
emblems
of
love
.
<EOS>
What
was
I
?
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
my
pain
of
heart
and
frantic
effort
of
principle
,
I
abhorred
myself
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
solace
from
self
-
approbation
:
none
even
from
self
-
respect
.
<EOS>
I
had
injured
 
wounded
 
left
my
master
.
<EOS>
I
was
hateful
in
my
own
eyes
.
<EOS>
Still
I
could
not
turn
,
nor
retrace
one
step
.
<EOS>
God
must
have
led
me
on
.
<EOS>
As
to
my
own
will
or
conscience
,
impassioned
grief
had
trampled
one
and
stifled
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
was
weeping
wildly
as
I
walked
along
my
solitary
way
:
fast
,
fast
I
went
like
one
delirious
.
<EOS>
A
weakness
,
beginning
inwardly
,
extending
to
the
limbs
,
seized
me
,
and
I
fell
:
<EOS>
I
lay
on
the
ground
some
minutes
,
pressing
my
face
to
the
wet
turf
.
<EOS>
I
had
some
fear
 
or
hope
 
that
here
I
should
die
:
but
I
was
soon
up
;
crawling
forwards
on
my
hands
and
knees
,
and
then
again
raised
to
my
feet
 
as
eager
and
as
determined
as
ever
to
reach
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
got
there
,
I
was
forced
to
sit
to
rest
me
under
the
hedge
;
and
while
I
sat
,
I
heard
wheels
,
and
saw
a
coach
come
on
.
<EOS>
I
stood
up
and
lifted
my
hand
;
it
stopped
.
<EOS>
I
asked
where
it
was
going
:
the
driver
named
a
place
a
long
way
off
,
and
where
I
was
sure
Mr.
Rochester
had
no
connections
.
<EOS>
I
asked
for
what
sum
he
would
take
me
there
;
he
said
thirty
shillings
;
I
answered
I
had
but
twenty
;
well
,
he
would
try
to
make
it
do
.
<EOS>
He
further
gave
me
leave
to
get
into
the
inside
,
as
the
vehicle
was
empty
:
I
entered
,
was
shut
in
,
and
it
rolled
on
its
way
.
  
<EOS>
Gentle
reader
,
may
you
never
feel
what
I
then
felt
!
<EOS>
May
your
eyes
never
shed
such
stormy
,
scalding
,
heart
-
wrung
tears
as
poured
from
mine
.
<EOS>
May
you
never
appeal
to
Heaven
in
prayers
so
hopeless
and
so
agonised
as
in
that
hour
left
my
lips
;
for
never
may
you
,
like
me
,
dread
to
be
the
instrument
of
evil
to
what
you
wholly
love
.
    
<EOS>
Two
days
are
passed
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
summer
evening
;
the
coachman
has
set
me
down
at
a
place
called
Whitcross
;
he
could
take
me
no
farther
for
the
sum
I
had
given
,
and
I
was
not
possessed
of
another
shilling
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
The
coach
is
a
mile
off
by
this
time
;
I
am
alone
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
I
discover
that
I
forgot
to
take
my
parcel
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
coach
,
where
I
had
placed
it
for
safety
;
there
it
remains
,
there
it
must
remain
;
and
now
,
I
am
absolutely
destitute
.
  
<EOS>
Whitcross
is
no
town
,
nor
even
a
hamlet
;
it
is
but
a
stone
pillar
set
up
where
four
roads
meet
:
whitewashed
,
I
suppose
,
to
be
more
obvious
at
a
distance
and
in
darkness
.
<EOS>
Four
arms
spring
from
its
summit
:
the
nearest
town
to
which
these
point
is
,
according
to
the
inscription
,
distant
ten
miles
;
the
farthest
,
above
twenty
.
<EOS>
From
the
well
-
known
names
of
these
towns
I
learn
in
what
county
I
have
lighted
;
a
north
-
midland
shire
,
dusk
with
moorland
,
ridged
with
mountain
:
this
I
see
.
<EOS>
There
are
great
moors
behind
and
on
each
hand
of
me
;
there
are
waves
of
mountains
far
beyond
that
deep
valley
at
my
feet
.
<EOS>
The
population
here
must
be
thin
,
and
I
see
no
passengers
on
these
roads
:
they
stretch
out
east
,
west
,
north
,
and
south
 
white
,
broad
,
lonely
;
they
are
all
cut
in
the
moor
,
and
the
heather
grows
deep
and
wild
to
their
very
verge
.
<EOS>
Yet
a
chance
traveller
might
pass
by
;
and
I
wish
no
eye
to
see
me
now
:
strangers
would
wonder
what
I
am
doing
,
lingering
here
at
the
sign
-
post
,
evidently
objectless
and
lost
.
<EOS>
I
might
be
questioned
:
I
could
give
no
answer
but
what
would
sound
incredible
and
excite
suspicion
.
<EOS>
Not
a
tie
holds
me
to
human
society
at
this
moment
 
not
a
charm
or
hope
calls
me
where
my
fellow
-
creatures
are
 
none
that
saw
me
would
have
a
kind
thought
or
a
good
wish
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
relative
but
the
universal
mother
,
Nature
:
<EOS>
I
will
seek
her
breast
and
ask
repose
.
  
<EOS>
I
struck
straight
into
the
heath
;
I
held
on
to
a
hollow
<EOS>
I
saw
deeply
furrowing
the
brown
moorside
;
I
waded
knee
-
deep
in
its
dark
growth
;
I
turned
with
its
turnings
,
and
finding
a
moss
-
blackened
granite
crag
in
a
hidden
angle
,
I
sat
down
under
it
.
<EOS>
High
banks
of
moor
were
about
me
;
the
crag
protected
my
head
:
the
sky
was
over
that
.
  
<EOS>
Some
time
passed
before
I
felt
tranquil
even
here
:
I
had
a
vague
dread
that
wild
cattle
might
be
near
,
or
that
some
sportsman
or
poacher
might
discover
me
.
<EOS>
If
a
gust
of
wind
swept
the
waste
,
I
looked
up
,
fearing
it
was
the
rush
of
a
bull
;
if
a
plover
whistled
,
I
imagined
it
a
man
.
<EOS>
Finding
my
apprehensions
unfounded
,
however
,
and
calmed
by
the
deep
silence
that
reigned
as
evening
declined
at
nightfall
,
I
took
confidence
.
<EOS>
As
yet
I
had
not
thought
;
I
had
only
listened
,
watched
,
dreaded
;
now
I
regained
the
faculty
of
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
What
was
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
Where
to
go
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
intolerable
questions
,
when
I
could
do
nothing
and
go
nowhere
!
 
<EOS>
when
a
long
way
must
yet
be
measured
by
my
weary
,
trembling
limbs
before
I
could
reach
human
habitation
 
when
cold
charity
must
be
entreated
before
I
could
get
a
lodging
:
reluctant
sympathy
importuned
,
<EOS>
almost
certain
repulse
incurred
,
before
my
tale
could
be
listened
to
,
or
one
of
my
wants
relieved
!
  
<EOS>
I
touched
the
heath
:
it
was
dry
,
and
yet
warm
with
the
heat
of
the
summer
day
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
the
sky
;
it
was
pure
:
a
kindly
star
twinkled
just
above
the
chasm
ridge
.
<EOS>
The
dew
fell
,
but
with
propitious
softness
;
no
breeze
whispered
.
<EOS>
Nature
seemed
to
me
benign
and
good
;
I
thought
she
loved
me
,
outcast
as
I
was
;
and
I
,
who
from
man
could
anticipate
only
mistrust
,
rejection
,
insult
,
clung
to
her
with
filial
fondness
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
,
at
least
,
I
would
be
her
guest
,
as
I
was
her
child
:
my
mother
would
lodge
me
without
money
and
without
price
.
<EOS>
I
had
one
morsel
of
bread
yet
:
the
remnant
of
a
roll
I
had
bought
in
a
town
we
passed
through
at
noon
with
a
stray
penny
 
<EOS>
my
last
coin
.
<EOS>
I
saw
ripe
bilberries
gleaming
here
and
there
,
like
jet
beads
in
the
heath
:
I
gathered
a
handful
and
ate
them
with
the
bread
.
<EOS>
My
hunger
,
sharp
before
,
was
,
if
not
satisfied
,
appeased
by
this
hermit
's
meal
.
<EOS>
I
said
my
evening
prayers
at
its
conclusion
,
and
then
chose
my
couch
.
  
<EOS>
{
I
said
my
evening
prayers
:
p311.jpg
}
  
<EOS>
Beside
the
crag
the
heath
was
very
deep
:
when
I
lay
down
my
feet
were
buried
in
it
;
rising
high
on
each
side
,
it
left
only
a
narrow
space
for
the
night
-
air
to
invade
.
<EOS>
I
folded
my
shawl
double
,
and
spread
it
over
me
for
a
coverlet
;
a
low
,
mossy
swell
was
my
pillow
.
<EOS>
Thus
lodged
,
I
was
not
,
at
least
 
at
the
commencement
of
the
night
,
cold
.
  
<EOS>
My
rest
might
have
been
blissful
enough
,
only
a
sad
heart
broke
it
.
<EOS>
It
plained
of
its
gaping
wounds
,
its
inward
bleeding
,
its
riven
chords
.
<EOS>
It
trembled
for
Mr.
Rochester
and
his
doom
;
it
bemoaned
him
with
bitter
pity
;
it
demanded
him
with
ceaseless
longing
;
and
,
impotent
as
a
bird
with
both
wings
broken
,
it
still
quivered
its
shattered
pinions
in
vain
attempts
to
seek
him
.
  
<EOS>
Worn
out
with
this
torture
of
thought
,
I
rose
to
my
knees
.
<EOS>
Night
was
come
,
and
her
planets
were
risen
:
a
safe
,
still
night
:
too
serene
for
the
companionship
of
fear
.
<EOS>
We
know
that
God
is
everywhere
;
but
certainly
we
feel
His
presence
most
when
His
works
are
on
the
grandest
scale
spread
before
us
;
and
it
is
in
the
unclouded
night
-
sky
,
where
His
worlds
wheel
their
silent
course
,
that
we
read
clearest
<EOS>
His
infinitude
,
His
omnipotence
,
His
omnipresence
.
<EOS>
I
had
risen
to
my
knees
to
pray
for
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
Looking
up
,
I
,
with
tear
-
dimmed
eyes
,
saw
the
mighty
Milky-
way
.
<EOS>
Remembering
what
it
was
 
what
countless
systems
there
swept
space
like
a
soft
trace
of
light
 
<EOS>
I
felt
the
might
and
strength
of
God
.
<EOS>
Sure
was
I
of
His
efficiency
to
save
what
He
had
made
:
convinced
I
grew
that
neither
earth
should
perish
,
nor
one
of
the
souls
it
treasured
.
<EOS>
I
turned
my
prayer
to
thanksgiving
:
the
Source
of
Life
was
also
the
Saviour
of
spirits
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
was
safe
;
he
was
God
's
,
and
by
God
would
he
be
guarded
.
<EOS>
I
again
nestled
to
the
breast
of
the
hill
;
and
ere
long
in
sleep
forgot
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
But
next
day
,
Want
came
to
me
pale
and
bare
.
<EOS>
Long
after
the
little
birds
had
left
their
nests
;
long
after
bees
had
come
in
the
sweet
prime
of
day
to
gather
the
heath
honey
before
the
dew
was
dried
 
when
the
long
morning
shadows
were
curtailed
,
and
the
sun
filled
earth
and
sky
 
I
got
up
,
and
I
looked
round
me
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
still
,
hot
,
perfect
day
!
<EOS>
What
a
golden
desert
this
spreading
moor
!
<EOS>
Everywhere
sunshine
.
<EOS>
I
wished
I
could
live
in
it
and
on
it
.
<EOS>
I
saw
a
lizard
run
over
the
crag
;
I
saw
a
bee
busy
among
the
sweet
bilberries
.
<EOS>
I
would
fain
at
the
moment
have
become
bee
or
lizard
,
that
I
might
have
found
fitting
nutriment
,
permanent
shelter
here
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
a
human
being
,
and
had
a
human
being
's
wants
:
I
must
not
linger
where
there
was
nothing
to
supply
them
.
<EOS>
I
rose
;
I
looked
back
at
the
bed
I
had
left
.
<EOS>
Hopeless
of
the
future
<EOS>
,
I
wished
but
this
 
that
my
Maker
had
that
night
thought
good
to
require
my
soul
of
me
while
I
slept
;
and
that
this
weary
frame
,
absolved
by
death
from
further
conflict
with
fate
,
had
now
but
to
decay
quietly
,
and
mingle
in
peace
with
the
soil
of
this
wilderness
.
<EOS>
Life
,
however
,
was
yet
in
my
possession
,
with
all
its
requirements
,
and
pains
,
and
responsibilities
.
<EOS>
The
burden
must
be
carried
;
the
want
provided
for
;
the
suffering
endured
;
the
responsibility
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
I
set
out
.
  
<EOS>
Whitcross
regained
,
I
followed
a
road
which
led
from
the
sun
,
now
fervent
and
high
.
<EOS>
By
no
other
circumstance
had
I
will
to
decide
my
choice
.
<EOS>
I
walked
a
long
time
,
and
when
I
thought
I
had
nearly
done
enough
,
and
might
conscientiously
yield
to
the
fatigue
that
almost
overpowered
me
 
might
relax
this
forced
action
,
and
,
sitting
down
on
a
stone
I
saw
near
,
submit
resistlessly
to
the
apathy
that
clogged
heart
and
limb
 
I
heard
a
bell
chime
 
a
church
bell
.
  
<EOS>
I
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
,
and
there
,
amongst
the
romantic
hills
,
whose
changes
and
aspect
I
had
ceased
to
note
an
hour
ago
,
I
saw
a
hamlet
and
a
spire
.
<EOS>
All
the
valley
at
my
right
hand
was
full
of
pasture-
fields
,
and
cornfields
,
and
wood
;
and
a
glittering
stream
ran
zig
-
zag
through
the
varied
shades
of
green
,
the
mellowing
grain
,
the
sombre
woodland
,
the
clear
and
sunny
lea
.
<EOS>
Recalled
by
the
rumbling
of
wheels
to
the
road
before
me
,
I
saw
a
heavily
-
laden
waggon
labouring
up
the
hill
,
and
not
far
beyond
were
two
cows
and
their
drover
.
<EOS>
Human
life
and
human
labour
were
near
.
<EOS>
I
must
struggle
on
:
strive
to
live
and
bend
to
toil
like
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
About
two
o'clock
<EOS>
p.m.
I
entered
the
village
.
<EOS>
At
the
bottom
of
its
one
street
there
was
a
little
shop
with
some
cakes
of
bread
in
the
window
.
<EOS>
I
coveted
a
cake
of
bread
.
<EOS>
With
that
refreshment
I
could
perhaps
regain
a
degree
of
energy
:
without
it
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
The
wish
to
have
some
strength
and
some
vigour
returned
to
me
as
soon
as
I
was
amongst
my
fellow
-
beings
.
<EOS>
I
felt
it
would
be
degrading
to
faint
with
hunger
on
the
causeway
of
a
hamlet
.
<EOS>
Had
I
nothing
about
me
I
could
offer
in
exchange
for
one
of
these
rolls
?
<EOS>
I
considered
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
small
silk
handkerchief
tied
round
my
throat
;
I
had
my
gloves
.
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
tell
how
men
and
women
in
extremities
of
destitution
proceeded
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
whether
either
of
these
articles
would
be
accepted
:
probably
they
would
not
;
but
I
must
try
.
  
<EOS>
I
entered
the
shop
:
a
woman
was
there
.
<EOS>
Seeing
a
respectably
-
dressed
person
,
a
lady
as
she
supposed
,
she
came
forward
with
civility
.
<EOS>
How
could
she
serve
me
?
<EOS>
I
was
seized
with
shame
:
my
tongue
would
not
utter
the
request
I
had
prepared
.
<EOS>
I
dared
not
offer
her
the
half
-
worn
gloves
,
the
creased
handkerchief
:
besides
,
I
felt
it
would
be
absurd
.
<EOS>
I
only
begged
permission
to
sit
down
a
moment
,
as
I
was
tired
.
<EOS>
Disappointed
in
the
expectation
of
a
customer
,
she
coolly
acceded
to
my
request
.
<EOS>
She
pointed
to
a
seat
;
I
sank
into
it
.
<EOS>
I
felt
sorely
urged
to
weep
;
but
conscious
how
unseasonable
such
a
manifestation
would
be
,
I
restrained
it
.
<EOS>
Soon
I
asked
her
"
if
there
were
any
dressmaker
or
plain
-
workwoman
in
the
village
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
two
or
three
.
<EOS>
Quite
as
many
as
there
was
employment
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
reflected
.
<EOS>
I
was
driven
to
the
point
now
.
<EOS>
I
was
brought
face
to
face
with
Necessity
.
<EOS>
I
stood
in
the
position
of
one
without
a
resource
,
without
a
friend
,
without
a
coin
.
<EOS>
I
must
do
something
.
<EOS>
What
?
<EOS>
I
must
apply
somewhere
.
<EOS>
Where
?
  
<EOS>
"
Did
she
know
of
any
place
in
the
neighbourhood
where
a
servant
was
wanted
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
;
she
could
n't
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
was
the
chief
trade
in
this
place
?
<EOS>
What
did
most
of
the
people
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Some
were
farm
labourers
;
a
good
deal
worked
at
Mr.
Oliver
's
needle
-
factory
,
and
at
the
foundry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
Mr.
Oliver
employ
women
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
;
it
was
men
's
work
.
"
  
"
And
what
do
the
women
do
?
"
  
"
I
knawn't
,
"
was
the
answer
.
<EOS>
"
Some
does
one
thing
,
and
some
another
.
<EOS>
Poor
folk
mun
get
on
as
they
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
be
tired
of
my
questions
:
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
what
claim
had
I
to
importune
her
?
<EOS>
A
neighbour
or
two
came
in
;
my
chair
was
evidently
wanted
.
<EOS>
I
took
leave
.
  
<EOS>
I
passed
up
the
street
,
looking
as
I
went
at
all
the
houses
to
the
right
hand
and
to
the
left
;
but
I
could
discover
no
pretext
,
nor
see
an
inducement
to
enter
any
.
<EOS>
I
rambled
round
the
hamlet
,
going
sometimes
to
a
little
distance
and
returning
again
,
for
an
hour
or
more
.
<EOS>
Much
exhausted
,
and
suffering
greatly
now
for
want
of
food
,
I
turned
aside
into
a
lane
and
sat
down
under
the
hedge
.
<EOS>
Ere
many
minutes
had
elapsed
,
I
was
again
on
my
feet
,
however
,
and
again
searching
something
 
<EOS>
a
resource
,
or
at
least
an
informant
.
<EOS>
A
pretty
little
house
stood
at
the
top
of
the
lane
,
with
a
garden
before
it
,
exquisitely
neat
and
brilliantly
blooming
.
<EOS>
I
stopped
at
it
.
<EOS>
What
business
had
I
to
approach
the
white
door
or
touch
the
glittering
knocker
?
<EOS>
In
what
way
could
it
possibly
be
the
interest
of
the
inhabitants
of
that
dwelling
to
serve
me
?
<EOS>
Yet
I
drew
near
and
knocked
.
<EOS>
A
mild
-
looking
,
cleanly
-
attired
young
woman
opened
the
door
.
<EOS>
In
such
a
voice
as
might
be
expected
from
a
hopeless
heart
and
fainting
frame
 
a
voice
wretchedly
low
and
faltering
 
<EOS>
I
asked
if
a
servant
was
wanted
here
?
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
she
;
"
we
do
not
keep
a
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
tell
me
where
I
could
get
employment
of
any
kind
?
<EOS>
"
I
continued
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
stranger
,
without
acquaintance
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
I
want
some
work
:
no
matter
what
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
her
business
to
think
for
me
,
or
to
seek
a
place
for
me
:
<EOS>
besides
,
in
her
eyes
,
how
doubtful
must
have
appeared
my
character
,
position
,
tale
.
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
,
she
"
was
sorry
she
could
give
me
no
information
,
"
and
the
white
door
closed
,
quite
gently
and
civilly
:
but
it
shut
me
out
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
held
it
open
a
little
longer
,
I
believe
I
should
have
begged
a
piece
of
bread
;
for
I
was
now
brought
low
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
to
return
to
the
sordid
village
,
where
,
besides
,
no
prospect
of
aid
was
visible
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
longed
rather
to
deviate
to
a
wood
I
saw
not
far
off
,
which
appeared
in
its
thick
shade
to
offer
inviting
shelter
;
but
I
was
so
sick
,
so
weak
,
so
gnawed
with
nature
's
cravings
,
instinct
kept
me
roaming
round
abodes
where
there
was
a
chance
of
food
.
<EOS>
Solitude
would
be
no
solitude
 
rest
no
rest
 
while
the
vulture
,
hunger
,
thus
sank
beak
and
talons
in
my
side
.
  
<EOS>
I
drew
near
houses
;
I
left
them
,
and
came
back
again
,
and
again
I
wandered
away
:
always
repelled
by
the
consciousness
of
having
no
claim
to
ask
 
no
right
to
expect
interest
in
my
isolated
lot
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
the
afternoon
advanced
,
while
I
thus
wandered
about
like
a
lost
and
starving
dog
.
<EOS>
In
crossing
a
field
,
I
saw
the
church
spire
before
me
:
I
hastened
towards
it
.
<EOS>
Near
the
churchyard
,
and
in
the
middle
of
a
garden
,
stood
a
well
-
built
though
small
house
,
which
I
had
no
doubt
<EOS>
was
the
parsonage
.
<EOS>
I
remembered
that
strangers
who
arrive
at
a
place
where
they
have
no
friends
,
and
who
want
employment
,
sometimes
apply
to
the
clergyman
for
introduction
and
aid
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
clergyman
's
function
to
help
 
at
least
with
advice
 
those
who
wished
to
help
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
seemed
to
have
something
like
a
right
to
seek
counsel
here
.
<EOS>
Renewing
then
my
courage
,
and
gathering
my
feeble
remains
of
strength
,
I
pushed
on
.
<EOS>
I
reached
the
house
,
and
knocked
at
the
kitchen
-
door
.
<EOS>
An
old
woman
opened
:
I
asked
was
this
the
parsonage
?
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
the
clergyman
in
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
he
be
in
soon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
was
gone
from
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
a
distance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
so
far
 
happen
three
mile
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
called
away
by
the
sudden
death
of
his
father
:
he
was
at
Marsh
End
now
,
and
would
very
likely
stay
there
a
fortnight
longer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
there
any
lady
of
the
house
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
there
was
naught
but
her
,
and
she
was
housekeeper
;
"
and
of
her
,
reader
,
I
could
not
bear
to
ask
the
relief
for
want
of
which
I
was
sinking
;
I
could
not
yet
beg
;
and
again
I
crawled
away
.
  
<EOS>
Once
more
I
took
off
my
handkerchief
 
once
more
<EOS>
I
thought
of
the
cakes
of
bread
in
the
little
shop
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
for
but
a
crust
!
<EOS>
for
but
one
mouthful
to
allay
the
pang
of
famine
!
<EOS>
Instinctively
I
turned
my
face
again
to
the
village
;
I
found
the
shop
again
,
and
I
went
in
;
and
though
others
were
there
besides
the
woman
I
ventured
the
request
 
<EOS>
"
Would
she
give
me
a
roll
for
this
handkerchief
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
at
me
with
evident
suspicion
:
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
she
never
sold
stuff
<EOS>
i
'
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Almost
desperate
,
I
asked
for
half
a
cake
;
she
again
refused
.
<EOS>
"
How
could
she
tell
where
I
had
got
the
handkerchief
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
she
take
my
gloves
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
what
could
she
do
with
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
Reader
,
it
is
not
pleasant
to
dwell
on
these
details
.
<EOS>
Some
say
there
is
enjoyment
in
looking
back
to
painful
experience
past
;
but
at
this
day
I
can
scarcely
bear
to
review
the
times
to
which
I
allude
:
<EOS>
the
moral
degradation
,
blent
with
the
physical
suffering
,
form
too
distressing
a
recollection
ever
to
be
willingly
dwelt
on
.
<EOS>
I
blamed
none
of
those
who
repulsed
me
.
<EOS>
I
felt
it
was
what
was
to
be
expected
,
and
what
could
not
be
helped
:
an
ordinary
beggar
is
frequently
an
object
of
suspicion
;
a
well
-
dressed
beggar
inevitably
so
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
what
I
begged
was
employment
;
but
whose
business
was
it
to
provide
me
with
employment
?
<EOS>
Not
,
certainly
,
that
of
persons
who
saw
me
then
for
the
first
time
,
and
who
knew
nothing
about
my
character
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
the
woman
who
would
not
take
my
handkerchief
in
exchange
for
her
bread
,
why
,
she
was
right
,
if
the
offer
appeared
to
her
sinister
or
the
exchange
unprofitable
.
<EOS>
Let
me
condense
now
.
<EOS>
I
am
sick
of
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
A
little
before
dark
I
passed
a
farm
-
house
,
at
the
open
door
of
which
the
farmer
was
sitting
,
eating
his
supper
of
bread
and
cheese
.
<EOS>
I
stopped
and
said
    
"
Will
you
give
me
a
piece
of
bread
?
<EOS>
for
I
am
very
hungry
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
cast
on
me
a
glance
of
surprise
;
but
without
answering
,
he
cut
a
thick
slice
from
his
loaf
,
and
gave
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
imagine
he
did
not
think
I
was
a
beggar
,
but
only
an
eccentric
sort
of
lady
,
who
had
taken
a
fancy
to
his
brown
loaf
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
was
out
of
sight
of
his
house
,
I
sat
down
and
ate
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
hope
to
get
a
lodging
under
a
roof
,
and
sought
it
in
the
wood
I
have
before
alluded
to
.
<EOS>
But
my
night
was
wretched
,
my
rest
broken
:
<EOS>
the
ground
was
damp
,
the
air
cold
:
besides
,
intruders
passed
near
me
more
than
once
,
and
I
had
again
and
again
to
change
my
quarters
;
no
sense
of
safety
or
tranquillity
befriended
me
.
<EOS>
Towards
morning
it
rained
;
the
whole
of
the
following
day
was
wet
.
<EOS>
Do
not
ask
me
,
reader
,
to
give
a
minute
account
of
that
day
;
as
before
,
I
sought
work
;
as
before
,
I
was
repulsed
;
as
before
,
I
starved
;
but
once
did
food
pass
my
lips
.
<EOS>
At
the
door
of
a
cottage
I
saw
a
little
girl
about
to
throw
a
mess
of
cold
porridge
into
a
pig
trough
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
me
that
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
{
"
Will
you
give
me
that
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
:
p316.jpg
}
  
<EOS>
She
stared
at
me
.
"
<EOS>
Mother
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
"
there
is
a
woman
wants
me
to
give
her
these
porridge
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
lass
,
"
replied
a
voice
within
,
"
give
it
her
if
she
's
a
beggar
.
<EOS>
T
'
pig
does
n't
want
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
girl
emptied
the
stiffened
mould
into
my
hand
,
and
I
devoured
it
ravenously
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
wet
twilight
deepened
,
I
stopped
in
a
solitary
bridle
-
path
,
which
I
had
been
pursuing
an
hour
or
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
strength
is
quite
failing
me
,
"
I
said
in
a
soliloquy
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
I
can
not
go
much
farther
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
be
an
outcast
again
this
night
?
<EOS>
While
the
rain
descends
so
,
must
I
lay
my
head
on
the
cold
,
drenched
ground
?
<EOS>
I
fear
I
can
not
do
otherwise
:
for
who
will
receive
me
?
<EOS>
But
it
will
be
very
dreadful
,
with
this
feeling
of
hunger
,
faintness
,
chill
,
and
this
sense
of
desolation
 
this
total
prostration
of
hope
.
<EOS>
In
all
likelihood
,
though
,
I
should
die
before
morning
.
<EOS>
And
why
can
not
I
reconcile
myself
to
the
prospect
of
death
?
<EOS>
Why
do
I
struggle
to
retain
a
valueless
life
?
<EOS>
Because
I
know
,
or
believe
,
Mr.
Rochester
is
living
:
and
then
,
to
die
of
want
and
cold
is
a
fate
to
which
nature
can
not
submit
passively
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Providence
!
<EOS>
sustain
me
a
little
longer
!
<EOS>
Aid
!
 
<EOS>
direct
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
My
glazed
eye
wandered
over
the
dim
and
misty
landscape
.
<EOS>
I
saw
I
had
strayed
far
from
the
village
:
it
was
quite
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
The
very
cultivation
surrounding
it
had
disappeared
.
<EOS>
I
had
,
by
cross
-
ways
and
by-
paths
,
once
more
drawn
near
the
tract
of
moorland
;
and
now
<EOS>
,
only
a
few
fields
,
almost
as
wild
and
unproductive
as
the
heath
from
which
they
were
scarcely
reclaimed
,
lay
between
me
and
the
dusky
hill
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
would
rather
die
yonder
than
in
a
street
or
on
a
frequented
road
,
"
I
reflected
.
"
<EOS>
And
far
better
that
crows
and
ravens
 
if
any
ravens
there
be
in
these
regions
 
should
pick
my
flesh
from
my
bones
,
than
that
they
should
be
prisoned
in
a
workhouse
coffin
and
moulder
in
a
pauper
's
grave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
the
hill
,
then
,
I
turned
.
<EOS>
I
reached
it
.
<EOS>
It
remained
now
only
to
find
a
hollow
where
I
could
lie
down
,
and
feel
at
least
hidden
,
if
not
secure
.
<EOS>
But
all
the
surface
of
the
waste
looked
level
.
<EOS>
It
showed
no
variation
but
of
tint
:
green
,
where
rush
and
moss
overgrew
the
marshes
;
black
,
where
the
dry
soil
bore
only
heath
.
<EOS>
Dark
as
it
was
getting
,
I
could
still
see
these
changes
,
though
<EOS>
but
as
mere
alternations
of
light
and
shade
;
for
colour
had
faded
with
the
daylight
.
  
<EOS>
My
eye
still
roved
over
the
sullen
swell
and
along
the
moor
-
edge
,
vanishing
amidst
the
wildest
scenery
,
when
at
one
dim
point
,
far
in
among
the
marshes
and
the
ridges
,
a
light
sprang
up
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
an
_
ignis
fatuus
_
,
"
was
my
first
thought
;
and
I
expected
it
would
soon
vanish
.
<EOS>
It
burnt
on
,
however
,
quite
steadily
,
neither
receding
nor
advancing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
it
,
then
,
a
bonfire
just
kindled
?
<EOS>
"
I
questioned
.
<EOS>
I
watched
to
see
whether
it
would
spread
:
but
no
;
as
it
did
not
diminish
,
so
it
did
not
enlarge
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
a
candle
in
a
house
,
"
I
then
conjectured
;
"
but
if
so
,
I
can
never
reach
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
much
too
far
away
:
and
were
it
within
a
yard
of
me
,
what
would
it
avail
?
<EOS>
I
should
but
knock
at
the
door
to
have
it
shut
in
my
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
I
sank
down
where
I
stood
,
and
hid
my
face
against
the
ground
.
<EOS>
I
lay
still
a
while
:
the
night
-
wind
swept
over
the
hill
and
over
me
,
and
died
moaning
in
the
distance
;
the
rain
fell
fast
,
wetting
me
afresh
to
the
skin
.
<EOS>
Could
<EOS>
I
but
have
stiffened
to
the
still
frost
 
the
friendly
numbness
of
death
 
it
might
have
pelted
on
;
I
should
not
have
felt
it
;
but
my
yet
living
flesh
shuddered
at
its
chilling
influence
.
<EOS>
I
rose
ere
long
.
  
<EOS>
The
light
was
yet
there
,
shining
dim
but
constant
through
the
rain
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
walk
again
:
I
dragged
my
exhausted
limbs
slowly
towards
it
.
<EOS>
It
led
me
aslant
over
the
hill
,
through
a
wide
bog
,
which
would
have
been
impassable
in
winter
,
and
was
splashy
and
shaking
even
now
,
in
the
height
of
summer
.
<EOS>
Here
I
fell
twice
;
but
as
often
I
rose
and
rallied
my
faculties
.
<EOS>
This
light
was
my
forlorn
hope
:
I
must
gain
it
.
  
<EOS>
Having
crossed
the
marsh
,
I
saw
a
trace
of
white
over
the
moor
.
<EOS>
I
approached
it
;
it
was
a
road
or
a
track
:
it
led
straight
up
to
the
light
,
which
now
beamed
from
a
sort
of
knoll
,
amidst
a
clump
of
trees
 
firs
,
apparently
,
from
what
I
could
distinguish
of
the
character
of
their
forms
and
foliage
through
the
gloom
.
<EOS>
My
star
vanished
as
I
drew
near
:
some
obstacle
had
intervened
between
me
and
it
.
<EOS>
I
put
out
my
hand
to
feel
the
dark
mass
before
me
:
I
discriminated
the
rough
stones
of
a
low
wall
 
above
it
,
something
like
palisades
,
and
within
,
a
high
and
prickly
hedge
.
<EOS>
I
groped
on
.
<EOS>
Again
a
whitish
object
gleamed
before
me
:
it
was
a
gate
 
<EOS>
a
wicket
;
it
moved
on
its
hinges
as
I
touched
it
.
<EOS>
On
each
side
stood
a
sable
bush
-
holly
or
yew
.
  
<EOS>
Entering
the
gate
and
passing
the
shrubs
,
the
silhouette
of
a
house
rose
to
view
,
black
,
low
,
and
rather
long
;
but
the
guiding
light
shone
nowhere
.
<EOS>
All
was
obscurity
.
<EOS>
Were
the
inmates
retired
to
rest
?
<EOS>
I
feared
it
must
be
so
.
<EOS>
In
seeking
the
door
,
I
turned
an
angle
:
there
shot
out
the
friendly
gleam
again
,
from
the
lozenged
panes
of
a
very
small
latticed
window
,
within
a
foot
of
the
ground
,
made
still
smaller
by
the
growth
of
ivy
or
some
other
creeping
plant
,
whose
leaves
clustered
thick
over
the
portion
of
the
house
wall
in
which
it
was
set
.
<EOS>
The
aperture
was
so
screened
and
narrow
,
that
curtain
or
shutter
had
been
deemed
unnecessary
;
and
when
I
stooped
down
and
put
aside
the
spray
of
foliage
shooting
over
it
,
I
could
see
all
within
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
clearly
a
room
with
a
sanded
floor
,
clean
scoured
;
a
dresser
of
walnut
,
with
pewter
plates
ranged
in
rows
,
reflecting
the
redness
and
radiance
of
a
glowing
peat
-
fire
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
a
clock
,
a
white
deal
table
,
some
chairs
.
<EOS>
The
candle
,
whose
ray
had
been
my
beacon
,
burnt
on
the
table
;
and
by
its
light
an
elderly
woman
,
somewhat
rough
-
looking
,
but
scrupulously
clean
,
like
all
about
her
,
was
knitting
a
stocking
.
  
<EOS>
I
noticed
these
objects
cursorily
only
 
in
them
there
was
nothing
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
A
group
of
more
interest
appeared
near
the
hearth
,
sitting
still
amidst
the
rosy
peace
and
warmth
suffusing
it
.
<EOS>
Two
young
,
graceful
women
 
ladies
in
every
point
 
sat
,
one
in
a
low
rocking
-
chair
,
the
other
on
a
lower
stool
;
both
wore
deep
mourning
of
crape
and
bombazeen
,
which
sombre
garb
singularly
set
off
very
fair
necks
and
faces
:
a
large
old
pointer
dog
rested
its
massive
head
on
the
knee
of
one
girl
 
in
the
lap
of
the
other
was
cushioned
a
black
cat
.
  
<EOS>
A
strange
place
was
this
humble
kitchen
for
such
occupants
!
<EOS>
Who
were
they
?
<EOS>
They
could
not
be
the
daughters
of
the
elderly
person
at
the
table
;
for
she
looked
like
a
rustic
,
and
they
were
all
delicacy
and
cultivation
.
<EOS>
I
had
nowhere
seen
such
faces
as
theirs
:
and
yet
,
as
I
gazed
on
them
,
I
seemed
intimate
with
every
lineament
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
call
them
handsome
 
<EOS>
they
were
too
pale
and
grave
for
the
word
:
<EOS>
as
they
each
bent
over
a
book
,
they
looked
thoughtful
almost
to
severity
.
<EOS>
A
stand
between
them
supported
a
second
candle
and
two
great
volumes
,
to
which
they
frequently
referred
,
comparing
them
,
seemingly
,
with
the
smaller
books
they
held
in
their
hands
,
like
people
consulting
a
dictionary
to
aid
them
in
the
task
of
translation
.
<EOS>
This
scene
was
as
silent
as
if
all
the
figures
had
been
shadows
and
the
firelit
apartment
a
picture
<EOS>
:
so
hushed
was
it
,
I
could
hear
the
cinders
fall
from
the
grate
,
the
clock
tick
in
its
obscure
corner
;
and
I
even
fancied
I
could
distinguish
the
click
-
click
of
the
woman
's
knitting
-
needles
.
<EOS>
When
,
therefore
,
a
voice
broke
the
strange
stillness
at
last
,
it
was
audible
enough
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Listen
,
Diana
,
"
said
one
of
the
absorbed
students
;
"
Franz
and
old
Daniel
are
together
in
the
night
-
time
,
and
Franz
is
telling
a
dream
from
which
he
has
awakened
in
terror
 
listen
!
"
<EOS>
And
in
a
low
voice
she
read
something
,
of
which
not
one
word
was
intelligible
to
me
;
for
it
was
in
an
unknown
tongue
 
neither
French
nor
Latin
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
were
Greek
or
German
I
could
not
tell
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
strong
,
"
she
said
,
when
she
had
finished
:
"
I
relish
it
.
"
<EOS>
The
other
girl
,
who
had
lifted
her
head
to
listen
to
her
sister
,
repeated
,
while
she
gazed
at
the
fire
,
a
line
of
what
had
been
read
.
<EOS>
At
a
later
day
,
I
knew
the
language
and
the
book
;
therefore
,
I
will
here
quote
the
line
:
though
,
when
I
first
heard
it
,
it
was
only
like
a
stroke
on
sounding
brass
to
me
 
conveying
no
meaning
:
    
"
<EOS>
"
Da
trat
hervor
Einer
,
anzusehen
wie
die
Sternen
Nacht
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
!
good
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
while
her
dark
and
deep
eye
sparkled
.
<EOS>
"
There
you
have
a
dim
and
mighty
archangel
fitly
set
before
you
!
<EOS>
The
line
is
worth
a
hundred
pages
of
fustian
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ich
wage
die
Gedanken
in
der
Schale
meines
Zornes
und
<EOS>
die
Werke
mit
<EOS>
dem
Gewichte
meines
Grimms
.
<EOS>
"
I
like
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Both
were
again
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
ony
country
where
they
talk
i
'
that
way
?
"
asked
the
old
woman
,
looking
up
from
her
knitting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Hannah
 
a
far
larger
country
than
England
,
where
they
talk
in
no
other
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
for
sure
case
,
I
knawn't
how
they
can
understand
t
'
one
t'other
:
<EOS>
and
if
either
o
'
ye
went
there
,
ye
could
tell
what
they
said
,
I
guess
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
could
probably
tell
something
of
what
they
said
,
but
not
all
 
for
we
are
not
as
clever
as
you
think
us
,
Hannah
.
<EOS>
We
do
n't
speak
German
,
and
we
can
not
read
it
without
a
dictionary
to
help
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
good
does
it
do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
mean
to
teach
it
some
time
 
or
at
least
the
elements
,
as
they
say
;
and
then
we
shall
get
more
money
than
we
do
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Varry
like
:
but
give
ower
studying
<EOS>
;
ye've
done
enough
for
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
have
:
at
least
I
'm
tired
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mortally
:
after
all
,
it
's
tough
work
fagging
away
at
a
language
with
no
master
but
a
lexicon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
especially
such
a
language
as
this
crabbed
but
glorious
Deutsch
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
when
St.
John
will
come
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
he
will
not
be
long
now
:
it
is
just
ten
(
looking
at
a
little
gold
watch
she
drew
from
her
girdle
)
.
<EOS>
It
rains
fast
,
Hannah
:
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
look
at
the
fire
in
the
parlour
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
woman
rose
:
<EOS>
she
opened
a
door
,
through
which
I
dimly
saw
a
passage
:
soon
I
heard
her
stir
a
fire
in
an
inner
room
;
she
presently
came
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
childer
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
"
it
fair
troubles
me
to
go
into
yond
"
room
now
<EOS>
:
it
looks
so
lonesome
wi
'
the
chair
empty
and
set
back
in
a
corner
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
wiped
her
eyes
with
her
apron
:
the
two
girls
,
grave
before
,
looked
sad
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
is
in
a
better
place
,
"
continued
Hannah
:
"
we
should
n't
wish
him
here
again
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
nobody
need
to
have
a
quieter
death
nor
he
had
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
he
never
mentioned
us
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
one
of
the
ladies
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
had
n't
time
,
bairn
:
<EOS>
he
was
gone
in
a
minute
,
was
your
father
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
bit
ailing
like
the
day
before
,
but
naught
to
signify
;
and
when
Mr.
St.
John
asked
if
he
would
like
either
o
<EOS>
'
ye
to
be
sent
for
,
he
fair
laughed
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
began
again
with
a
bit
of
a
heaviness
in
his
head
the
next
day
 
that
is
,
a
fortnight
sin
'
 
and
he
went
to
sleep
and
niver
wakened
:
<EOS>
he
wor
a'most
stark
when
your
brother
went
into
t
'
chamber
and
fand
him
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
childer
!
<EOS>
that
's
t
'
<EOS>
last
o
'
t
'
old
stock
 
for
ye
and
Mr.
St.
John
is
like
of
different
soart
to
them
'
<EOS>
at
's
gone
;
for
all
your
mother
wor
mich
<EOS>
i
'
your
way
,
and
a'most
as
book
-
learned
.
<EOS>
She
wor
the
pictur
"
o
'
ye
,
Mary
:
<EOS>
Diana
is
more
like
your
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
them
so
similar
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
where
the
old
servant
(
for
such
I
now
concluded
her
to
be
)
saw
the
difference
.
<EOS>
Both
were
fair
complexioned
and
slenderly
made
;
both
possessed
faces
full
of
distinction
and
intelligence
.
<EOS>
One
,
to
be
sure
,
had
hair
a
shade
darker
than
the
other
,
and
there
was
a
difference
in
their
style
of
wearing
it
;
Mary
's
pale
brown
locks
were
parted
and
braided
smooth
:
Diana
's
duskier
tresses
covered
her
neck
with
thick
curls
.
<EOS>
The
clock
struck
ten
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ye'll
want
your
supper
,
I
am
sure
,
"
observed
Hannah
;
"
and
so
will
Mr.
St.
John
when
he
comes
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
she
proceeded
to
prepare
the
meal
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
rose
;
they
seemed
about
to
withdraw
to
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
Till
this
moment
,
I
had
been
so
intent
on
watching
them
,
their
appearance
and
conversation
had
excited
in
me
<EOS>
so
keen
an
interest
<EOS>
,
I
had
half
-
forgotten
my
own
wretched
position
:
now
it
recurred
to
me
.
<EOS>
More
desolate
,
more
desperate
than
ever
,
it
seemed
from
contrast
.
<EOS>
And
how
impossible
did
it
appear
to
touch
the
inmates
of
this
house
with
concern
on
my
behalf
;
to
make
them
believe
in
the
truth
of
my
wants
and
woes
 
to
induce
them
to
vouchsafe
a
rest
for
my
wanderings
!
<EOS>
As
I
groped
out
the
door
,
and
knocked
at
it
hesitatingly
,
I
felt
that
last
idea
to
be
a
mere
chimera
.
<EOS>
Hannah
opened
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
she
inquired
,
in
a
voice
of
surprise
,
as
she
surveyed
me
by
the
light
of
the
candle
she
held
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
speak
to
your
mistresses
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
tell
me
what
you
have
to
say
to
them
.
<EOS>
Where
do
you
come
from
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
business
here
at
this
hour
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
a
night
's
shelter
in
an
out
-
house
or
anywhere
,
and
a
morsel
of
bread
to
eat
.
"
  
<EOS>
Distrust
,
the
very
feeling
I
dreaded
,
appeared
in
Hannah
's
face
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
give
you
a
piece
of
bread
,
"
she
said
,
after
a
pause
;
"
but
we
ca
n't
take
in
a
vagrant
to
lodge
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
likely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
let
me
speak
to
your
mistresses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
I.
<EOS>
What
can
they
do
for
you
?
<EOS>
You
should
not
be
roving
about
now
;
it
looks
very
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
where
shall
I
go
if
you
drive
me
away
?
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
'll
warrant
you
know
where
to
go
and
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
Mind
<EOS>
you
do
n't
do
wrong
<EOS>
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
Here
is
a
penny
;
now
go
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
penny
can
not
feed
me
,
and
I
have
no
strength
to
go
farther
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
shut
the
door
:
 
oh
,
do
n't
,
for
God
's
sake
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
;
the
rain
is
driving
in
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Tell
the
young
ladies
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
them
 
"
  
"
Indeed
,
I
will
not
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
what
you
ought
to
be
,
or
you
would
n't
make
such
a
noise
.
<EOS>
Move
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
die
if
I
am
turned
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
you
.
<EOS>
I
'm
fear'd
<EOS>
you
have
<EOS>
some
ill
plans
agate
,
that
bring
you
about
folk
's
houses
at
this
time
o
'
night
.
<EOS>
If
you
've
any
followers
 
housebreakers
or
such
like
 
<EOS>
anywhere
near
,
you
may
tell
them
we
are
not
by
ourselves
in
the
house
;
we
have
a
gentleman
,
and
dogs
,
and
guns
.
<EOS>
"
Here
the
honest
but
inflexible
servant
clapped
the
door
to
and
bolted
it
within
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
climax
.
<EOS>
A
pang
of
exquisite
suffering
 
a
throe
of
true
despair
 
rent
and
heaved
my
heart
.
<EOS>
Worn
out
,
indeed
,
I
was
;
not
another
step
<EOS>
could
I
stir
.
<EOS>
I
sank
on
the
wet
doorstep
:
<EOS>
I
groaned
 
<EOS>
I
wrung
my
hands
 
<EOS>
I
wept
in
utter
anguish
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
this
spectre
of
death
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
this
last
hour
,
approaching
in
such
horror
!
<EOS>
Alas
,
this
isolation
 
this
banishment
from
my
kind
!
<EOS>
Not
only
the
anchor
of
hope
,
but
the
footing
of
fortitude
was
gone
 
at
least
for
a
moment
;
but
the
last
I
soon
endeavoured
to
regain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
but
die
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
I
believe
in
God
.
<EOS>
Let
me
try
to
wait
His
will
in
silence
.
"
  
<EOS>
These
words
I
not
only
thought
,
but
uttered
;
and
thrusting
back
all
my
misery
into
my
heart
,
I
made
an
effort
to
compel
it
to
remain
there
 
dumb
and
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
men
must
die
,
"
said
a
voice
quite
close
at
hand
;
"
but
all
are
not
condemned
to
meet
a
lingering
and
premature
doom
,
such
as
yours
would
be
if
you
perished
here
of
want
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Who
or
what
speaks
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
terrified
at
the
unexpected
sound
,
and
incapable
now
of
deriving
from
any
occurrence
a
hope
of
aid
.
<EOS>
A
form
was
near
 
what
form
,
the
pitch
-
dark
night
and
my
enfeebled
vision
prevented
me
from
distinguishing
.
<EOS>
With
a
loud
long
knock
,
the
new
-
comer
appealed
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
you
,
Mr.
St.
John
?
"
cried
Hannah
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
yes
;
open
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
how
wet
and
cold
you
must
be
,
such
a
wild
night
as
it
is
!
<EOS>
Come
in
 
your
sisters
are
quite
uneasy
about
you
,
and
I
believe
there
are
bad
folks
about
.
<EOS>
There
has
been
a
beggar
-
woman
 
<EOS>
I
declare
she
is
not
gone
yet
!
 
<EOS>
laid
down
there
.
<EOS>
Get
up
!
<EOS>
for
shame
!
<EOS>
Move
off
,
I
say
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hush
,
Hannah
!
<EOS>
I
have
a
word
to
say
to
the
woman
.
<EOS>
You
have
done
your
duty
in
excluding
<EOS>
,
now
let
me
do
mine
in
admitting
her
.
<EOS>
I
was
near
,
and
listened
to
both
you
and
her
.
<EOS>
I
think
this
is
a
peculiar
case
 
<EOS>
I
must
at
least
examine
into
it
.
<EOS>
Young
woman
,
rise
,
and
pass
before
me
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
{
Hush
,
Hannah
;
I
have
a
word
to
say
to
the
woman
:
p323.jpg
}
  
With
difficulty
I
obeyed
him
.
<EOS>
Presently
I
stood
within
that
clean
,
bright
kitchen
 
on
the
very
hearth
 
trembling
,
sickening
;
conscious
of
an
aspect
in
the
last
degree
ghastly
,
wild
,
and
weather
-
beaten
.
<EOS>
The
two
ladies
,
their
brother
,
Mr.
St.
John
,
the
old
servant
,
were
all
gazing
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
St.
John
,
who
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
heard
one
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
:
<EOS>
I
found
her
at
the
door
,
"
was
the
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
does
look
white
,
"
said
Hannah
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
white
as
clay
or
death
,
"
was
responded
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
fall
:
let
her
sit
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
indeed
my
head
swam
:
I
dropped
,
but
a
chair
received
me
.
<EOS>
I
still
possessed
my
senses
,
though
just
now
I
could
not
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
a
little
water
would
restore
her
.
<EOS>
Hannah
,
fetch
some
.
<EOS>
But
she
is
worn
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
How
very
thin
,
and
how
very
bloodless
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
mere
spectre
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
ill
,
or
only
famished
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Famished
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
Hannah
,
is
that
milk
?
<EOS>
Give
it
me
,
and
a
piece
of
bread
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Diana
(
I
knew
her
by
the
long
curls
which
I
saw
drooping
between
me
and
the
fire
as
she
bent
over
me
)
broke
some
bread
,
dipped
it
in
milk
,
and
put
it
to
my
lips
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
near
mine
:
I
saw
there
was
pity
in
it
,
and
I
felt
sympathy
in
her
hurried
breathing
.
<EOS>
In
her
simple
words
,
too
,
the
same
balm
-
like
emotion
spoke
:
"
Try
to
eat
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
try
,
"
repeated
Mary
gently
;
and
Mary
's
hand
removed
my
sodden
bonnet
and
lifted
my
head
.
<EOS>
I
tasted
what
they
offered
me
:
feebly
at
first
,
eagerly
soon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
too
much
at
first
 
restrain
her
,
"
said
the
brother
;
"
she
has
had
enough
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
withdrew
the
cup
of
milk
and
the
plate
of
bread
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
little
more
,
St.
John
 
look
at
the
avidity
in
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
more
at
present
,
sister
.
<EOS>
Try
if
she
can
speak
now
 
ask
her
her
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
felt
I
could
speak
,
and
I
answered
 
"
My
name
is
Jane
Elliott
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Anxious
as
ever
to
avoid
discovery
,
I
had
before
resolved
to
assume
an
_
alias
_
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
do
you
live
?
<EOS>
Where
are
your
friends
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
we
send
for
any
one
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
account
can
you
give
of
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
Somehow
,
now
that
I
had
once
crossed
the
threshold
of
this
house
,
and
once
was
brought
face
to
face
with
its
owners
,
I
felt
no
longer
outcast
,
vagrant
,
and
disowned
by
the
wide
world
.
<EOS>
I
dared
to
put
off
the
mendicant
 
to
resume
my
natural
manner
and
character
.
<EOS>
I
began
once
more
to
know
myself
;
and
when
Mr.
St.
John
demanded
an
account
 
which
at
present
I
was
far
too
weak
to
render
 
<EOS>
I
said
after
a
brief
pause
    
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
can
give
you
no
details
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
,
then
,
"
said
he
,
"
do
you
expect
me
to
do
for
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
My
strength
sufficed
for
but
short
answers
.
<EOS>
Diana
took
the
word
    
"
Do
you
mean
,
"
she
asked
,
"
that
we
have
now
given
you
what
aid
you
require
?
<EOS>
and
that
we
may
dismiss
you
to
the
moor
and
the
rainy
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
looked
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
I
thought
,
a
remarkable
countenance
,
instinct
both
with
power
and
goodness
.
<EOS>
I
took
sudden
courage
.
<EOS>
Answering
her
compassionate
gaze
with
a
smile
,
I
said
 
"
I
will
trust
you
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
a
masterless
and
stray
dog
,
I
know
that
you
would
not
turn
me
from
your
hearth
to
-
night
:
<EOS>
as
it
is
,
I
really
have
no
fear
.
<EOS>
Do
with
me
and
for
me
as
you
like
;
but
excuse
me
from
much
discourse
 
<EOS>
my
breath
is
short
 
<EOS>
I
feel
a
spasm
when
I
speak
.
<EOS>
"
All
three
surveyed
me
,
and
all
three
were
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hannah
,
"
said
Mr.
St.
John
,
at
last
,
"
let
her
sit
there
at
present
,
and
ask
her
no
questions
;
in
ten
minutes
more
,
give
her
the
remainder
of
that
milk
and
bread
.
<EOS>
Mary
and
Diana
,
let
us
go
into
the
parlour
and
talk
the
matter
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
withdrew
.
<EOS>
Very
soon
one
of
the
ladies
returned
 
I
could
not
tell
which
.
<EOS>
A
kind
of
pleasant
stupor
was
stealing
over
me
as
I
sat
by
the
genial
fire
.
<EOS>
In
an
undertone
she
gave
some
directions
to
Hannah
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
with
the
servant
's
aid
,
I
contrived
to
mount
a
staircase
;
my
dripping
clothes
were
removed
;
soon
a
warm
,
dry
bed
received
me
.
<EOS>
I
thanked
God
 
experienced
amidst
unutterable
exhaustion
a
glow
of
grateful
joy
 
and
slept
.
    
<EOS>
The
recollection
of
about
three
days
and
nights
succeeding
this
is
very
dim
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
can
recall
some
sensations
felt
in
that
interval
;
but
few
thoughts
framed
,
and
no
actions
performed
.
<EOS>
I
knew
I
was
in
a
small
room
and
in
a
narrow
bed
.
<EOS>
To
that
bed
I
seemed
to
have
grown
;
I
lay
on
it
motionless
as
a
stone
;
and
to
have
torn
me
from
it
would
have
been
almost
to
kill
me
.
<EOS>
I
took
no
note
of
the
lapse
of
time
 
of
the
change
from
morning
to
noon
,
from
noon
to
evening
.
<EOS>
I
observed
when
any
one
entered
or
left
the
apartment
:
I
could
even
tell
who
they
were
;
I
could
understand
what
was
said
when
the
speaker
stood
near
to
me
;
but
I
could
not
answer
;
to
open
my
lips
or
move
my
limbs
was
equally
impossible
.
<EOS>
Hannah
,
the
servant
,
was
my
most
frequent
visitor
.
<EOS>
Her
coming
disturbed
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
feeling
that
she
wished
me
away
:
that
she
did
not
understand
me
or
my
circumstances
;
that
she
was
prejudiced
against
me
.
<EOS>
Diana
and
Mary
appeared
in
the
chamber
once
or
twice
a
day
.
<EOS>
They
would
whisper
sentences
of
this
sort
at
my
bedside
    
<EOS>
"
It
is
<EOS>
very
well
we
took
her
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
she
would
certainly
have
been
found
dead
at
the
door
in
the
morning
had
she
been
left
out
all
night
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
she
has
gone
through
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Strange
hardships
<EOS>
,
I
imagine
 
poor
,
emaciated
,
pallid
wanderer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
an
uneducated
person
,
I
should
think
,
by
her
manner
of
speaking
;
her
accent
was
quite
pure
;
and
the
clothes
she
took
off
,
though
splashed
and
wet
,
were
little
worn
and
fine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
a
peculiar
face
;
fleshless
and
haggard
as
it
is
,
<EOS>
I
rather
like
it
;
and
when
in
good
health
and
animated
,
I
can
fancy
her
physiognomy
would
be
agreeable
.
"
  
<EOS>
Never
once
in
their
dialogues
did
I
hear
a
syllable
of
regret
at
the
hospitality
they
had
extended
to
me
,
or
of
suspicion
of
,
or
aversion
to
,
myself
.
<EOS>
I
was
comforted
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
St.
John
came
but
once
:
he
looked
at
me
,
and
said
my
state
of
lethargy
was
the
result
of
reaction
from
excessive
and
protracted
fatigue
.
<EOS>
He
pronounced
it
needless
to
send
for
a
doctor
:
nature
,
he
was
sure
,
would
manage
best
,
left
to
herself
.
<EOS>
He
said
every
nerve
had
been
overstrained
in
some
way
,
and
the
whole
system
must
sleep
torpid
a
while
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
disease
.
<EOS>
He
imagined
my
recovery
would
be
rapid
enough
when
once
commenced
.
<EOS>
These
opinions
he
delivered
in
a
few
words
,
in
a
quiet
,
low
voice
;
and
added
,
after
a
pause
,
in
the
tone
of
a
man
little
accustomed
to
expansive
comment
,
"
Rather
an
unusual
physiognomy
;
certainly
,
not
indicative
of
vulgarity
or
degradation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Far
otherwise
,
"
responded
Diana
.
<EOS>
"
To
speak
truth
,
St.
John
,
my
heart
rather
warms
to
the
poor
little
soul
.
<EOS>
I
wish
we
may
be
able
to
benefit
her
permanently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
hardly
likely
,
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
she
is
some
young
lady
who
has
had
a
misunderstanding
with
her
friends
,
and
has
probably
injudiciously
left
them
.
<EOS>
We
may
,
perhaps
,
succeed
in
restoring
her
to
them
,
if
she
is
not
obstinate
:
but
I
trace
lines
of
force
in
her
face
which
make
me
sceptical
of
her
tractability
.
"
<EOS>
He
stood
considering
me
some
minutes
;
then
added
,
"
She
looks
sensible
,
but
not
at
all
handsome
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
so
ill
,
St.
John
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ill
or
well
,
she
would
always
be
plain
.
<EOS>
The
grace
and
harmony
of
beauty
are
quite
wanting
in
those
features
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
On
the
third
day
I
was
better
;
on
the
fourth
,
I
could
speak
,
move
,
rise
in
bed
,
and
turn
.
<EOS>
Hannah
had
brought
me
some
gruel
and
dry
toast
,
about
,
as
I
supposed
,
the
dinner
-
hour
.
<EOS>
I
had
eaten
with
relish
:
the
food
was
good
 
<EOS>
void
of
the
feverish
flavour
which
had
hitherto
poisoned
what
I
had
swallowed
.
<EOS>
When
she
left
me
,
I
felt
comparatively
strong
and
revived
:
ere
long
satiety
of
repose
and
desire
for
action
stirred
me
.
<EOS>
I
wished
to
rise
;
but
what
could
I
put
on
?
<EOS>
Only
my
damp
and
bemired
apparel
;
in
which
I
had
slept
on
the
ground
and
fallen
in
the
marsh
.
<EOS>
I
felt
ashamed
to
appear
before
my
benefactors
so
clad
.
<EOS>
I
was
spared
the
humiliation
.
  
<EOS>
On
a
chair
by
the
bedside
were
all
my
own
things
,
clean
and
dry
.
<EOS>
My
black
silk
frock
hung
against
the
wall
.
<EOS>
The
traces
of
the
bog
were
removed
from
it
;
the
creases
left
by
the
wet
smoothed
out
:
it
was
quite
decent
.
<EOS>
My
very
shoes
and
stockings
were
purified
and
rendered
presentable
.
<EOS>
There
were
the
means
of
washing
in
the
room
,
and
a
comb
and
brush
to
smooth
my
hair
.
<EOS>
After
a
weary
process
,
and
resting
every
five
minutes
,
I
succeeded
in
dressing
myself
.
<EOS>
My
clothes
hung
loose
on
me
;
for
I
was
much
wasted
,
but
I
covered
deficiencies
with
a
shawl
,
and
once
more
,
clean
and
respectable
looking
 
no
speck
of
the
dirt
,
no
trace
of
the
disorder
I
so
hated
,
and
which
seemed
so
to
degrade
me
,
left
 
<EOS>
I
crept
down
a
stone
staircase
with
the
aid
of
the
banisters
,
to
a
narrow
low
passage
,
and
found
my
way
presently
to
the
kitchen
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
full
of
the
fragrance
of
new
bread
and
the
warmth
of
a
generous
fire
.
<EOS>
Hannah
was
baking
.
<EOS>
Prejudices
,
it
is
well
known
,
are
most
difficult
to
eradicate
from
the
heart
whose
soil
has
never
been
loosened
or
fertilised
by
education
:
they
grow
there
,
firm
as
weeds
among
stones
.
<EOS>
Hannah
had
been
cold
and
stiff
,
indeed
,
at
the
first
:
latterly
she
had
begun
to
relent
a
little
;
and
when
she
saw
me
come
in
tidy
and
well
-
dressed
,
she
even
smiled
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
you
have
got
up
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
better
,
then
.
<EOS>
You
may
sit
you
down
in
my
chair
on
the
hearthstone
,
if
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
pointed
to
the
rocking
-
chair
:
<EOS>
I
took
it
.
<EOS>
She
bustled
about
,
examining
me
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
with
the
corner
of
her
eye
.
<EOS>
Turning
to
me
,
as
she
took
some
loaves
from
the
oven
,
she
asked
bluntly
    
"
Did
you
ever
go
a
-
begging
afore
<EOS>
you
came
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
indignant
for
a
moment
;
but
remembering
that
anger
was
out
of
the
question
,
and
that
I
had
indeed
appeared
as
a
beggar
to
her
,
I
answered
quietly
,
but
still
not
without
a
certain
marked
firmness
    
<EOS>
"
You
are
mistaken
in
supposing
me
a
beggar
.
<EOS>
I
am
no
beggar
;
any
more
than
yourself
or
your
young
ladies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
a
pause
she
said
,
"
I
dunnut
understand
that
:
you
've
like
no
house
,
nor
no
brass
,
I
guess
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
want
of
house
or
brass
(
by
which
I
suppose
you
mean
money
)
does
not
make
a
beggar
in
your
sense
of
the
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
book
-
learned
?
"
<EOS>
she
inquired
presently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
very
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
've
never
been
to
a
boarding
-
school
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
at
a
boarding
-
school
eight
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
opened
her
eyes
wide
.
<EOS>
"
Whatever
can
not
ye
keep
yourself
for
,
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
kept
myself
;
and
,
I
trust
,
shall
keep
myself
again
.
<EOS>
What
are
you
going
to
do
with
these
gooseberries
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
as
she
brought
out
a
basket
of
the
fruit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mak
'
'em
into
pies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
them
to
me
<EOS>
and
I
'll
pick
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
;
I
dunnut
want
ye
to
do
nought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
do
something
.
<EOS>
Let
me
have
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
consented
;
and
she
even
brought
me
a
clean
towel
to
spread
over
my
dress
,
"
lest
,
"
as
she
said
,
"
I
should
mucky
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ye've
not
been
used
to
sarvant
's
wark
,
I
see
by
your
hands
,
"
she
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Happen
<EOS>
ye've
been
a
dressmaker
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
you
are
wrong
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
never
mind
what
I
have
been
:
do
n't
trouble
your
head
further
about
me
;
but
tell
me
the
name
of
the
house
where
we
are
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Some
calls
it
Marsh
End
,
and
some
calls
it
Moor
House
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
the
gentleman
who
lives
here
is
called
Mr.
St.
John
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
;
he
does
n't
live
here
:
he
is
only
staying
a
while
.
<EOS>
When
he
is
at
home
,
he
is
in
his
own
parish
at
Morton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
village
a
few
miles
off
?
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
parson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
remembered
the
answer
of
the
old
housekeeper
at
the
parsonage
,
when
I
had
asked
to
see
the
clergyman
.
<EOS>
"
This
,
then
,
was
his
father
's
residence
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
;
old
Mr.
Rivers
lived
here
,
and
his
father
,
and
grandfather
,
and
gurt
<EOS>
(
great
)
grandfather
afore
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
name
,
then
,
of
that
gentleman
,
is
Mr.
St.
John
Rivers
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
;
St.
John
is
like
his
kirstened
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
his
sisters
are
called
Diana
and
Mary
Rivers
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Their
father
is
dead
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dead
three
weeks
sin
'
of
a
stroke
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
no
mother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
mistress
has
been
dead
this
mony
a
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
lived
with
the
family
long
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
lived
here
thirty
year
.
<EOS>
I
nursed
them
all
three
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
proves
you
must
have
been
an
honest
and
faithful
servant
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
so
much
for
you
,
though
you
have
had
the
incivility
to
call
me
a
beggar
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
again
regarded
me
with
a
surprised
stare
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
was
quite
mista'en
in
my
thoughts
of
you
:
but
there
is
so
mony
cheats
goes
about
,
you
mun
forgie
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
though
,
"
I
continued
,
rather
severely
,
"
you
wished
to
turn
me
from
the
door
,
on
a
night
when
you
should
not
have
shut
out
a
dog
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
was
hard
:
but
what
can
a
body
do
?
<EOS>
I
thought
more
o
'
th
'
 
childer
nor
of
mysel
:
poor
things
!
<EOS>
They
've
like
nobody
to
tak
'
care
on
"
em
<EOS>
but
me
.
<EOS>
I
'm
like
to
look
sharpish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
maintained
a
grave
silence
for
some
minutes
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
munnut
think
too
hardly
of
me
,
"
she
again
remarked
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
think
hardly
of
you
,
"
I
said
;
"
and
I
'll
tell
you
why
 
not
so
much
because
you
refused
to
give
me
shelter
,
or
regarded
me
as
an
impostor
,
as
because
you
just
now
made
it
a
species
of
reproach
that
I
had
no
"
brass
'
and
no
house
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
best
people
that
ever
lived
have
been
as
destitute
as
I
am
;
and
if
you
are
a
Christian
,
you
ought
not
to
consider
poverty
a
crime
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
more
I
ought
,
"
said
she
:
"
<EOS>
Mr.
St.
John
tells
me
so
too
;
and
I
see
I
wor
wrang
 
<EOS>
but
I
've
clear
a
different
notion
on
you
now
to
what
I
had
.
<EOS>
You
look
a
raight
down
dacent
little
crater
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
will
do
 
<EOS>
I
forgive
you
now
.
<EOS>
Shake
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
put
her
floury
and
horny
hand
into
mine
;
another
and
heartier
smile
illumined
her
rough
face
,
and
from
that
moment
we
were
friends
.
  
<EOS>
Hannah
was
evidently
fond
of
talking
.
<EOS>
While
I
picked
the
fruit
,
and
she
made
the
paste
for
the
pies
,
she
proceeded
to
give
me
sundry
details
about
her
deceased
master
and
mistress
,
and
"
the
childer
,
"
as
she
called
the
young
people
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Mr.
Rivers
,
she
said
,
was
a
plain
man
enough
,
but
a
gentleman
,
and
of
as
ancient
a
family
as
could
be
found
.
<EOS>
Marsh
End
had
belonged
to
the
Rivers
ever
since
it
was
a
house
:
and
it
was
,
she
affirmed
,
"
aboon
two
hundred
year
old
 
for
all
it
looked
but
a
small
,
humble
place
,
naught
to
compare
wi
'
Mr.
Oliver
's
grand
hall
down
i
'
Morton
Vale
.
<EOS>
But
she
could
remember
Bill
Oliver
's
father
a
journeyman
needlemaker
;
and
th
'
 
Rivers
wor
gentry
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
 
<EOS>
owd
days
o
'
th
'
 
Henrys
,
as
onybody
might
see
by
looking
into
th
'
 
registers
<EOS>
i
'
Morton
Church
vestry
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Still
,
she
allowed
,
"
the
owd
maister
was
like
other
folk
 
<EOS>
naught
mich
out
<EOS>
o
'
t
'
common
way
:
stark
mad
o
'
shooting
,
and
farming
,
and
sich
like
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
mistress
was
different
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
great
reader
,
and
studied
a
deal
;
and
the
"
bairns
"
had
taken
after
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
like
them
in
these
parts
,
nor
ever
had
been
;
they
had
liked
learning
,
all
three
,
almost
from
the
time
they
could
speak
;
and
they
had
always
been
"
of
a
mak
'
of
their
own
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
St.
John
,
when
he
grew
up
,
would
go
to
college
and
be
a
parson
;
and
the
girls
,
as
soon
as
they
left
school
,
would
seek
places
as
governesses
:
<EOS>
for
they
had
told
her
their
father
had
some
years
ago
lost
a
great
deal
of
money
by
a
man
he
had
trusted
turning
bankrupt
;
and
as
he
was
now
not
rich
enough
to
give
them
fortunes
,
they
must
provide
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
They
had
lived
very
little
at
home
for
a
long
while
,
and
were
only
come
now
to
stay
a
few
weeks
on
account
of
their
father
's
death
;
but
they
did
so
like
Marsh
End
and
Morton
,
and
all
these
moors
and
hills
about
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
in
London
,
and
many
other
grand
towns
;
but
they
always
said
there
was
no
place
like
home
;
and
then
they
were
so
agreeable
with
each
other
 
never
fell
out
nor
"
threaped
.
<EOS>
"
She
did
not
know
where
there
was
such
a
family
for
being
united
.
  
<EOS>
Having
finished
my
task
of
gooseberry
picking
,
I
asked
where
the
two
ladies
and
their
brother
were
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gone
over
to
Morton
for
a
walk
;
but
they
would
be
back
in
half
-
an
-
hour
to
tea
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
returned
within
the
time
Hannah
had
allotted
them
:
they
entered
by
the
kitchen
door
.
<EOS>
Mr.
St.
John
,
when
he
saw
me
,
merely
bowed
and
passed
through
;
the
two
ladies
stopped
:
<EOS>
Mary
,
in
a
few
words
,
kindly
and
calmly
expressed
the
pleasure
she
felt
in
seeing
me
well
enough
to
be
able
to
come
down
;
Diana
took
my
hand
:
she
shook
her
head
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
waited
for
my
leave
to
descend
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
still
look
very
pale
 
and
so
thin
!
<EOS>
Poor
child
!
 
<EOS>
poor
girl
!
"
  
<EOS>
Diana
had
a
voice
toned
,
to
my
ear
,
like
the
cooing
of
a
dove
.
<EOS>
She
possessed
eyes
whose
gaze
I
delighted
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
Her
whole
face
seemed
to
me
full
of
charm
.
<EOS>
Mary
's
countenance
was
equally
intelligent
 
<EOS>
her
features
equally
pretty
;
but
her
expression
was
more
reserved
,
and
her
manners
,
though
gentle
,
more
distant
.
<EOS>
Diana
looked
and
spoke
with
a
certain
authority
:
she
had
a
will
,
evidently
.
<EOS>
It
was
my
nature
to
feel
pleasure
in
yielding
to
an
authority
supported
like
hers
,
and
to
bend
,
where
my
conscience
and
self
-
respect
permitted
,
to
an
active
will
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
business
have
you
here
?
<EOS>
"
she
continued
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
your
place
.
<EOS>
Mary
and
I
sit
in
the
kitchen
sometimes
,
because
at
home
we
like
to
be
free
,
even
to
license
 
<EOS>
but
you
are
a
visitor
,
and
must
go
into
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
well
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
at
all
,
with
Hannah
bustling
about
and
covering
you
with
flour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
the
fire
is
too
hot
for
you
,
"
interposed
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
added
her
sister
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
you
must
be
obedient
.
"
<EOS>
And
still
holding
my
hand
she
made
me
rise
,
and
led
me
into
the
inner
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
there
,
"
she
said
,
placing
me
on
the
sofa
,
"
while
we
take
our
things
off
and
get
the
tea
ready
;
it
is
another
privilege
we
exercise
in
our
little
moorland
home
 
to
prepare
our
own
meals
when
we
are
so
inclined
,
or
when
Hannah
is
baking
,
brewing
,
washing
,
or
ironing
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
closed
the
door
,
leaving
me
solus
with
Mr.
St.
John
,
who
sat
opposite
,
a
book
or
newspaper
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
I
examined
first
,
the
parlour
,
and
then
its
occupant
.
  
<EOS>
The
parlour
was
rather
a
small
room
,
very
plainly
furnished
,
yet
comfortable
,
because
clean
and
neat
.
<EOS>
The
old
-
fashioned
chairs
were
very
bright
,
and
the
walnut
-
wood
table
was
like
a
looking
-
glass
.
<EOS>
A
few
strange
,
antique
portraits
of
the
men
and
women
of
other
days
decorated
the
stained
walls
;
a
cupboard
with
glass
doors
contained
some
books
and
an
ancient
set
of
china
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
superfluous
ornament
in
the
room
 
not
one
modern
piece
of
furniture
,
save
a
brace
of
workboxes
and
a
lady
's
desk
in
rosewood
,
which
stood
on
a
side
-
table
:
everything
 
including
the
carpet
and
curtains
 
<EOS>
looked
at
once
well
worn
and
well
saved
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
St.
John
 
sitting
as
still
as
one
of
the
dusty
pictures
on
the
walls
,
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
page
he
perused
,
and
his
lips
mutely
sealed
 
was
easy
enough
to
examine
.
<EOS>
Had
he
been
a
statue
instead
of
a
man
,
he
could
not
have
been
easier
.
<EOS>
He
was
young
 
perhaps
from
twenty-
eight
to
thirty
 
tall
,
slender
;
his
face
riveted
the
eye
;
it
was
like
a
Greek
face
,
very
pure
in
outline
:
quite
a
straight
,
classic
nose
;
quite
an
Athenian
mouth
and
chin
.
<EOS>
It
is
seldom
,
indeed
,
an
English
face
comes
so
near
the
antique
models
as
did
his
.
<EOS>
He
might
well
be
a
little
shocked
at
the
irregularity
of
my
lineaments
,
his
own
being
so
harmonious
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
large
and
blue
,
with
brown
lashes
;
his
high
forehead
,
colourless
as
ivory
,
was
partially
streaked
over
by
careless
locks
of
fair
hair
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
a
gentle
delineation
,
is
it
not
,
reader
?
<EOS>
Yet
he
whom
it
describes
scarcely
impressed
one
with
the
idea
of
a
gentle
,
a
yielding
,
an
impressible
,
or
even
of
a
placid
nature
.
<EOS>
Quiescent
as
he
now
sat
,
there
was
something
about
his
nostril
,
his
mouth
,
his
brow
,
which
,
to
my
perceptions
,
indicated
elements
within
either
restless
,
or
hard
,
or
eager
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
speak
to
me
one
word
,
nor
even
direct
to
me
one
glance
,
till
his
sisters
returned
.
<EOS>
Diana
,
as
she
passed
in
and
out
,
in
the
course
of
preparing
tea
,
brought
me
a
little
cake
,
baked
on
the
top
of
the
oven
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eat
that
<EOS>
now
,
"
she
said
:
"
you
must
be
hungry
.
<EOS>
Hannah
says
you
have
had
nothing
but
some
gruel
since
breakfast
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
did
not
refuse
it
,
for
my
appetite
was
awakened
and
keen
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rivers
now
closed
his
book
,
approached
the
table
,
and
,
as
he
took
a
seat
,
fixed
his
blue
pictorial
-
looking
eyes
full
on
me
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
unceremonious
directness
,
a
searching
,
decided
steadfastness
in
his
gaze
now
,
which
told
that
intention
,
and
not
diffidence
,
had
hitherto
kept
it
averted
from
the
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
hungry
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
way
 
it
always
was
my
way
,
by
instinct
 
ever
to
meet
the
brief
with
brevity
,
the
direct
with
plainness
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
well
for
you
that
a
low
fever
has
forced
you
to
abstain
for
the
last
three
days
:
there
would
have
been
danger
in
yielding
to
the
cravings
of
your
appetite
at
first
.
<EOS>
Now
you
may
eat
,
though
still
not
immoderately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
trust
I
shall
not
eat
long
at
your
expense
,
sir
,
"
was
my
very
clumsily-
contrived
,
unpolished
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
said
coolly
:
"
when
you
have
indicated
to
us
the
residence
of
your
friends
,
we
can
write
to
them
,
and
you
may
be
restored
to
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
,
I
must
plainly
tell
you
,
is
out
of
my
power
to
do
;
being
absolutely
without
home
and
friends
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
three
looked
at
me
,
but
not
distrustfully
;
I
felt
there
was
no
suspicion
in
their
glances
:
there
was
more
of
curiosity
.
<EOS>
I
speak
particularly
of
the
young
ladies
.
<EOS>
St.
John
's
eyes
,
though
clear
enough
in
a
literal
sense
,
in
a
figurative
one
were
difficult
to
fathom
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
use
them
rather
as
instruments
to
search
other
people
's
thoughts
,
than
as
agents
to
reveal
his
own
:
the
which
combination
of
keenness
and
reserve
was
considerably
more
calculated
to
embarrass
than
to
encourage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
say
,
"
he
asked
,
"
that
you
are
completely
isolated
from
every
connection
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
Not
a
tie
links
me
to
any
living
thing
:
not
a
claim
<EOS>
do
I
possess
to
admittance
under
any
roof
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
most
singular
position
at
your
age
!
"
  
<EOS>
Here
I
saw
his
glance
directed
to
my
hands
,
which
were
folded
on
the
table
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
wondered
what
he
sought
there
:
his
words
soon
explained
the
quest
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
never
been
married
?
<EOS>
You
are
a
spinster
?
"
  
<EOS>
Diana
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
she
ca
n't
be
above
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
old
,
St.
John
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
near
nineteen
:
<EOS>
but
I
am
not
married
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
felt
a
burning
glow
mount
to
my
face
;
for
bitter
and
agitating
recollections
were
awakened
by
the
allusion
to
marriage
.
<EOS>
They
all
saw
the
embarrassment
and
the
emotion
.
<EOS>
Diana
and
Mary
relieved
me
by
turning
their
eyes
elsewhere
than
to
my
crimsoned
visage
;
but
the
colder
and
sterner
brother
continued
to
gaze
,
till
the
trouble
he
had
excited
forced
out
tears
as
well
as
colour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
did
you
last
reside
?
<EOS>
"
he
now
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
too
inquisitive
,
St.
John
,
"
murmured
Mary
in
a
low
voice
;
but
he
leaned
over
the
table
and
required
an
answer
by
a
second
firm
and
piercing
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
name
of
the
place
where
,
and
of
the
person
with
whom
I
lived
,
is
my
secret
,
"
I
replied
concisely
.
  
<EOS>
"
Which
,
if
you
like
,
you
have
,
in
my
opinion
,
a
right
to
keep
,
both
from
St.
John
and
every
other
questioner
,
"
remarked
Diana
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
if
I
know
nothing
about
you
or
your
history
,
I
can
not
help
you
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
you
need
help
,
do
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
it
,
and
I
seek
it
so
far
,
sir
,
that
some
true
philanthropist
will
put
me
in
the
way
of
getting
work
which
I
can
do
,
and
the
remuneration
for
which
will
keep
me
,
if
but
in
the
barest
necessaries
of
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
whether
I
am
a
true
philanthropist
;
yet
I
am
willing
to
aid
you
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
in
a
purpose
so
honest
.
<EOS>
First
,
then
,
tell
me
what
you
have
been
accustomed
to
do
,
and
what
you
_
can
_
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
now
swallowed
my
tea
.
<EOS>
I
was
mightily
refreshed
by
the
beverage
;
as
much
so
as
a
giant
with
wine
:
it
gave
new
tone
to
my
unstrung
nerves
,
and
enabled
me
to
address
this
penetrating
young
judge
steadily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rivers
<EOS>
,
"
I
said
,
turning
to
him
,
and
looking
at
him
,
as
he
looked
at
me
,
openly
and
without
diffidence
,
"
you
and
your
sisters
have
done
me
a
great
service
 
<EOS>
the
greatest
man
can
do
his
fellow
-
being
;
you
have
rescued
me
,
by
your
noble
hospitality
,
from
death
.
<EOS>
This
benefit
conferred
gives
you
an
unlimited
claim
on
my
gratitude
,
and
a
claim
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
on
my
confidence
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
as
much
of
the
history
of
the
wanderer
you
have
harboured
,
as
I
can
tell
without
compromising
my
own
peace
of
mind
 
my
own
security
,
moral
and
physical
,
and
that
of
others
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
an
orphan
,
the
daughter
of
a
clergyman
.
<EOS>
My
parents
died
before
I
could
know
them
.
<EOS>
I
was
brought
up
a
dependant
;
educated
in
a
charitable
institution
.
<EOS>
I
will
even
tell
you
the
name
of
the
establishment
,
where
I
passed
six
years
as
a
pupil
,
and
two
as
a
teacher
 
Lowood
Orphan
Asylum
,
  
<EOS>
shire
:
<EOS>
you
will
have
heard
of
it
,
Mr.
Rivers
?
 
<EOS>
the
Rev.
Robert
Brocklehurst
is
the
treasurer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
of
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
and
I
have
seen
the
school
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
left
Lowood
nearly
a
year
since
to
become
a
private
governess
.
<EOS>
I
obtained
a
good
situation
,
and
was
happy
.
<EOS>
This
place
I
was
obliged
to
leave
four
days
before
I
came
here
.
<EOS>
The
reason
of
my
departure
I
can
not
and
ought
not
to
explain
:
it
would
be
useless
,
dangerous
,
and
would
sound
incredible
.
<EOS>
No
blame
attached
to
me
:
I
am
as
free
from
culpability
as
any
one
of
you
three
.
<EOS>
Miserable
I
am
,
and
must
be
for
a
time
;
for
the
catastrophe
which
drove
me
from
a
house
I
had
found
a
paradise
was
of
a
strange
and
direful
nature
.
<EOS>
I
observed
but
two
points
in
planning
my
departure
 
speed
,
secrecy
:
to
secure
these
,
I
had
to
leave
behind
me
everything
I
possessed
except
a
small
parcel
;
which
,
in
my
hurry
and
trouble
of
mind
,
I
forgot
to
take
out
of
the
coach
that
brought
me
to
Whitcross
.
<EOS>
To
this
neighbourhood
,
then
,
I
came
,
quite
destitute
.
<EOS>
I
slept
two
nights
in
the
open
air
,
and
wandered
about
two
days
without
crossing
a
threshold
:
but
twice
in
that
space
of
time
did
I
taste
food
;
and
it
was
when
brought
by
hunger
,
exhaustion
,
and
despair
almost
to
the
last
gasp
,
that
you
,
Mr.
Rivers
,
forbade
me
to
perish
of
want
at
your
door
,
and
took
me
under
the
shelter
of
your
roof
.
<EOS>
I
know
all
your
sisters
have
done
for
me
since
 
for
I
have
not
been
insensible
during
my
seeming
torpor
 
<EOS>
and
I
owe
to
their
spontaneous
,
genuine
,
genial
compassion
as
large
a
debt
as
to
your
evangelical
charity
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
make
her
talk
any
more
now
,
St.
John
,
"
said
Diana
,
as
I
paused
;
"
she
is
evidently
not
yet
fit
for
excitement
.
<EOS>
Come
to
the
sofa
and
sit
down
now
,
Miss
Elliott
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
gave
an
involuntary
half
start
at
hearing
the
_
alias
_
:
I
had
forgotten
my
new
name
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rivers
,
whom
nothing
seemed
to
escape
,
noticed
it
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
said
your
name
was
Jane
Elliott
?
"
<EOS>
he
observed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
say
so
;
and
it
is
the
name
by
which
I
think
it
expedient
to
be
called
at
present
,
but
it
is
not
my
real
name
,
and
when
I
hear
it
,
it
sounds
strange
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
real
name
you
will
not
give
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
:
I
fear
discovery
above
all
things
;
and
whatever
disclosure
would
lead
to
it
,
I
avoid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
right
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Diana
.
<EOS>
"
Now
do
,
brother
,
let
her
be
at
peace
a
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
when
St.
John
had
mused
a
few
moments
he
recommenced
as
imperturbably
and
with
as
much
acumen
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
like
to
be
long
dependent
on
our
hospitality
 
<EOS>
you
would
wish
,
I
see
,
to
dispense
as
soon
as
may
be
with
my
sisters
'
compassion
,
and
,
above
all
,
with
my
_
charity
_
<EOS>
(
I
am
quite
sensible
of
the
distinction
drawn
,
nor
do
I
resent
it
 
<EOS>
it
is
just
)
:
<EOS>
you
desire
to
be
independent
of
us
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
:
I
have
already
said
so
.
<EOS>
Show
me
how
to
work
,
or
how
to
seek
work
<EOS>
:
that
is
all
I
now
ask
;
then
let
me
go
,
if
it
be
but
to
the
meanest
cottage
;
but
till
then
,
allow
me
to
stay
here
:
I
dread
another
essay
of
the
horrors
of
homeless
destitution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
_
shall
_
stay
here
,
"
said
Diana
,
putting
her
white
hand
on
my
head
.
<EOS>
"
You
_
shall
_
,
"
repeated
Mary
,
in
the
tone
of
undemonstrative
sincerity
which
seemed
natural
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
sisters
,
you
see
,
have
a
pleasure
in
keeping
you
,
"
said
Mr.
St.
John
,
"
as
they
would
have
a
pleasure
in
keeping
and
cherishing
a
half
-
frozen
bird
,
some
wintry
wind
might
have
driven
through
their
casement
.
<EOS>
I
feel
more
inclination
to
put
you
in
the
way
of
keeping
yourself
,
and
shall
endeavour
to
do
so
;
but
observe
,
my
sphere
is
narrow
.
<EOS>
I
am
but
the
incumbent
of
a
poor
country
parish
:
<EOS>
my
aid
must
be
of
the
humblest
sort
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
are
inclined
to
despise
the
day
of
small
things
,
seek
some
more
efficient
succour
than
such
as
I
can
offer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
already
said
that
she
is
willing
to
do
anything
honest
she
can
do
,
"
answered
Diana
for
me
;
"
and
you
know
,
St.
John
,
she
has
no
choice
of
helpers
<EOS>
:
she
is
forced
to
put
up
with
such
crusty
people
as
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
a
dressmaker
;
I
will
be
a
plain
-
workwoman
;
I
will
be
a
servant
,
a
nurse
-
girl
,
if
I
can
be
no
better
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Right
,
"
said
Mr.
St.
John
,
quite
coolly
.
<EOS>
"
If
such
is
your
spirit
,
I
promise
to
aid
you
,
in
my
own
time
and
way
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
now
resumed
the
book
with
which
he
had
been
occupied
before
tea
.
<EOS>
I
soon
withdrew
,
for
I
had
talked
as
much
,
and
sat
up
as
long
,
as
my
present
strength
would
permit
.
    
<EOS>
The
more
I
knew
of
the
inmates
of
Moor
House
,
the
better
I
liked
them
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
days
I
had
so
far
recovered
my
health
that
I
could
sit
up
all
day
,
and
walk
out
sometimes
.
<EOS>
I
could
join
with
Diana
and
Mary
in
all
their
occupations
;
converse
with
them
as
much
as
they
wished
,
and
aid
them
when
and
where
they
would
allow
me
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
reviving
pleasure
in
this
intercourse
,
of
a
kind
now
tasted
by
me
for
the
first
time
 
the
pleasure
arising
from
perfect
congeniality
of
tastes
,
sentiments
,
and
principles
.
  
<EOS>
I
liked
to
read
what
they
liked
to
read
:
what
they
enjoyed
,
delighted
me
;
what
they
approved
,
I
reverenced
.
<EOS>
They
loved
their
sequestered
home
.
<EOS>
I
,
too
,
in
the
grey
,
small
,
antique
structure
,
with
its
low
roof
,
its
latticed
casements
,
its
mouldering
walls
,
its
avenue
of
aged
firs
 
<EOS>
all
grown
aslant
under
the
stress
of
mountain
winds
;
its
garden
,
dark
with
yew
and
holly
 
and
where
no
flowers
but
of
the
hardiest
species
would
bloom
 
found
a
charm
both
potent
and
permanent
.
<EOS>
They
clung
to
the
purple
moors
behind
and
around
their
dwelling
 
to
the
hollow
vale
into
which
the
pebbly
bridle
-
path
leading
from
their
gate
descended
,
and
which
wound
between
fern
-
banks
first
,
and
then
amongst
a
few
of
the
wildest
little
pasture
-
fields
that
ever
bordered
a
wilderness
of
heath
,
or
gave
sustenance
to
a
flock
of
grey
moorland
sheep
,
with
their
little
mossy-
faced
lambs
:
 
<EOS>
they
clung
to
this
scene
,
I
say
,
with
a
perfect
enthusiasm
of
attachment
.
<EOS>
I
could
comprehend
the
feeling
,
and
share
both
its
strength
and
truth
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
fascination
of
the
locality
.
<EOS>
I
felt
the
consecration
of
its
loneliness
:
my
eye
feasted
on
the
outline
of
swell
and
sweep
 
on
the
wild
colouring
communicated
to
ridge
and
dell
by
moss
,
by
heath
-
bell
,
by
flower
-
sprinkled
turf
,
by
brilliant
bracken
,
and
mellow
granite
crag
.
<EOS>
These
details
were
just
to
me
<EOS>
what
they
were
to
them
 
so
many
pure
and
sweet
sources
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
The
strong
blast
and
the
soft
breeze
;
the
rough
and
the
halcyon
day
;
the
hours
of
sunrise
and
sunset
;
the
moonlight
and
the
clouded
night
,
developed
for
me
,
in
these
regions
,
the
same
attraction
as
for
them
 
<EOS>
wound
round
my
faculties
the
same
spell
that
entranced
theirs
.
  
<EOS>
Indoors
we
agreed
equally
well
.
<EOS>
They
were
both
more
accomplished
and
better
read
than
I
was
;
but
with
eagerness
I
followed
in
the
path
of
knowledge
they
had
trodden
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
devoured
the
books
they
lent
me
:
then
it
was
full
satisfaction
to
discuss
with
them
in
the
evening
what
I
had
perused
during
the
day
.
<EOS>
Thought
fitted
thought
;
opinion
met
opinion
:
<EOS>
we
coincided
,
in
short
,
perfectly
.
  
<EOS>
If
in
our
trio
there
was
a
superior
and
a
leader
,
it
was
Diana
.
<EOS>
Physically
,
she
far
excelled
me
:
<EOS>
she
was
handsome
;
she
was
vigorous
.
<EOS>
In
her
animal
spirits
there
was
an
affluence
of
life
and
certainty
of
flow
,
such
as
excited
my
wonder
,
while
it
baffled
my
comprehension
.
<EOS>
I
could
talk
a
while
when
the
evening
commenced
,
but
the
first
gush
of
vivacity
and
fluency
gone
,
I
was
fain
to
sit
on
a
stool
at
Diana
's
feet
,
to
rest
my
head
on
her
knee
,
and
listen
alternately
to
her
and
Mary
,
while
they
sounded
thoroughly
the
topic
on
which
I
had
but
touched
.
<EOS>
Diana
offered
to
teach
me
German
.
<EOS>
I
liked
to
learn
of
her
:
I
saw
the
part
of
instructress
pleased
and
suited
her
;
that
of
scholar
pleased
and
suited
me
no
less
.
<EOS>
Our
natures
dovetailed
:
mutual
affection
 
of
the
strongest
kind
 
was
the
result
.
<EOS>
They
discovered
I
could
draw
:
their
pencils
and
colour
-
boxes
were
immediately
at
my
service
.
<EOS>
My
skill
,
greater
in
this
one
point
than
theirs
,
surprised
and
charmed
them
.
<EOS>
Mary
would
sit
and
watch
me
by
the
hour
together
:
then
she
would
take
lessons
;
and
a
docile
,
intelligent
,
assiduous
pupil
she
made
.
<EOS>
Thus
occupied
,
and
mutually
entertained
,
days
passed
like
hours
,
and
weeks
like
days
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
Mr.
St
John
,
the
intimacy
which
had
arisen
so
naturally
and
rapidly
between
me
and
his
sisters
did
not
extend
to
him
.
<EOS>
One
reason
of
the
distance
yet
observed
between
us
was
,
that
he
was
comparatively
seldom
at
home
:
a
large
proportion
of
his
time
appeared
devoted
to
visiting
the
sick
and
poor
among
the
scattered
population
of
his
parish
.
  
<EOS>
No
weather
seemed
to
hinder
him
in
these
pastoral
excursions
:
rain
or
fair
,
he
would
,
when
his
hours
of
morning
study
were
over
,
take
his
hat
,
and
,
followed
by
his
father
's
old
pointer
,
Carlo
,
go
out
on
his
mission
of
love
or
duty
 
<EOS>
I
scarcely
know
in
which
light
he
regarded
it
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
when
the
day
was
very
unfavourable
,
his
sisters
would
expostulate
.
<EOS>
He
would
then
say
,
with
a
peculiar
smile
,
more
solemn
than
cheerful
    
"
<EOS>
And
if
I
let
a
gust
of
wind
or
a
sprinkling
of
rain
turn
me
aside
from
these
easy
tasks
,
what
preparation
would
such
sloth
be
for
the
future
I
propose
to
myself
?
"
  
<EOS>
Diana
and
Mary
's
general
answer
to
this
question
was
a
sigh
,
and
some
minutes
of
apparently
mournful
meditation
.
  
<EOS>
But
besides
his
frequent
absences
,
there
was
another
barrier
to
friendship
with
him
:
he
seemed
of
a
reserved
,
an
abstracted
,
and
even
of
a
brooding
nature
.
<EOS>
Zealous
in
his
ministerial
labours
,
blameless
in
his
life
and
habits
,
he
yet
did
not
appear
to
enjoy
that
mental
serenity
,
that
inward
content
,
which
should
be
the
reward
of
every
sincere
Christian
and
practical
philanthropist
.
<EOS>
Often
,
of
an
evening
,
when
he
sat
at
the
window
,
his
desk
and
papers
before
him
,
he
would
cease
reading
or
writing
,
rest
his
chin
on
his
hand
,
and
deliver
himself
up
to
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
course
of
thought
;
but
that
it
was
perturbed
and
exciting
might
be
seen
in
the
frequent
flash
and
changeful
dilation
of
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
moreover
,
that
Nature
was
not
to
him
that
treasury
of
delight
it
was
to
his
sisters
.
<EOS>
He
expressed
once
,
and
but
once
in
my
hearing
,
a
strong
sense
of
the
rugged
charm
of
the
hills
,
and
an
inborn
affection
for
the
dark
roof
and
hoary
walls
he
called
his
home
;
but
there
was
more
of
gloom
than
pleasure
in
the
tone
and
words
in
which
the
sentiment
was
manifested
;
and
never
did
he
seem
to
roam
the
moors
for
the
sake
of
their
soothing
silence
 
never
seek
out
or
dwell
upon
the
thousand
peaceful
delights
they
could
yield
.
  
<EOS>
Incommunicative
<EOS>
as
he
was
,
some
time
elapsed
before
I
had
an
opportunity
of
gauging
his
mind
.
<EOS>
I
first
got
an
idea
of
its
calibre
when
I
heard
him
preach
in
his
own
church
at
Morton
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
describe
that
sermon
:
but
it
is
past
my
power
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
even
render
faithfully
the
effect
it
produced
on
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
began
calm
 
and
indeed
,
as
far
as
delivery
and
pitch
of
voice
went
,
it
was
calm
to
the
end
:
an
earnestly
felt
,
yet
strictly
restrained
zeal
breathed
soon
in
the
distinct
accents
,
and
prompted
the
nervous
language
.
<EOS>
This
grew
to
force
 
compressed
,
condensed
,
controlled
.
<EOS>
The
heart
was
thrilled
,
the
mind
astonished
,
by
the
power
of
the
preacher
:
neither
were
softened
.
<EOS>
Throughout
there
was
a
strange
bitterness
;
an
absence
of
consolatory
gentleness
;
stern
allusions
to
Calvinistic
doctrines
 
election
,
predestination
,
reprobation
 
were
frequent
;
and
each
reference
to
these
points
sounded
like
a
sentence
pronounced
for
doom
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
done
,
instead
of
feeling
better
,
calmer
,
more
enlightened
by
his
discourse
,
I
experienced
an
inexpressible
sadness
;
for
it
seemed
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
equally
so
to
others
 
that
the
eloquence
to
which
I
had
been
listening
had
sprung
from
a
depth
where
lay
turbid
dregs
of
disappointment
 
where
moved
troubling
impulses
of
insatiate
yearnings
and
disquieting
aspirations
.
<EOS>
I
was
sure
<EOS>
St.
John
Rivers
 
<EOS>
pure
-
lived
,
conscientious
,
zealous
as
he
was
 
had
not
yet
found
that
peace
of
God
which
passeth
all
understanding
:
he
had
no
more
found
it
,
I
thought
,
than
had
I
with
my
concealed
and
racking
regrets
for
my
broken
idol
and
lost
elysium
 
regrets
to
which
I
have
latterly
avoided
referring
,
but
which
possessed
me
and
tyrannised
over
me
ruthlessly
.
  
<EOS>
Meantime
a
month
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Diana
and
Mary
were
soon
to
leave
Moor
House
,
and
return
to
the
far
different
life
and
scene
which
awaited
them
,
as
governesses
in
a
large
,
fashionable
,
south
-
of
-
England
city
,
where
each
held
a
situation
in
families
by
whose
wealthy
and
haughty
members
they
were
regarded
only
as
humble
dependants
,
and
who
neither
knew
nor
sought
out
their
innate
excellences
,
and
appreciated
only
their
acquired
accomplishments
as
they
appreciated
the
skill
of
their
cook
or
the
taste
of
their
waiting
-
woman
.
<EOS>
Mr.
St.
John
had
said
nothing
to
me
yet
about
the
employment
he
had
promised
to
obtain
for
me
;
yet
it
became
urgent
that
I
should
have
a
vocation
of
some
kind
.
<EOS>
One
morning
,
being
left
alone
with
him
a
few
minutes
in
the
parlour
,
I
ventured
to
approach
the
window
-
recess
 
which
his
table
,
chair
,
and
desk
consecrated
as
a
kind
of
study
 
<EOS>
and
I
was
going
to
speak
,
though
<EOS>
not
very
well
knowing
in
what
words
to
frame
my
inquiry
 
for
it
is
at
all
times
difficult
to
break
the
ice
of
reserve
glassing
over
such
natures
as
his
 
when
he
saved
me
the
trouble
by
being
the
first
to
commence
a
dialogue
.
  
<EOS>
Looking
up
as
I
drew
near
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
question
to
ask
of
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
wish
to
know
whether
you
have
heard
of
any
service
I
can
offer
myself
to
undertake
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
found
or
devised
something
for
you
three
weeks
ago
;
but
as
you
seemed
both
useful
and
happy
here
 
as
my
sisters
had
evidently
become
attached
to
you
,
and
your
society
gave
them
unusual
pleasure
 
<EOS>
I
deemed
it
inexpedient
to
break
in
on
your
mutual
comfort
till
their
approaching
departure
from
Marsh
End
should
render
yours
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
they
will
go
in
three
days
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
and
when
they
go
,
I
shall
return
to
the
parsonage
at
Morton
:
<EOS>
Hannah
will
accompany
me
;
and
this
old
house
will
be
shut
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
waited
a
few
moments
,
expecting
he
would
go
on
with
the
subject
first
broached
:
but
he
seemed
to
have
entered
another
train
of
reflection
:
his
look
denoted
abstraction
from
me
and
my
business
.
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
recall
him
to
a
theme
which
was
of
necessity
one
of
close
and
anxious
interest
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
employment
you
had
in
view
,
Mr.
Rivers
?
<EOS>
I
hope
this
delay
will
not
have
increased
the
difficulty
of
securing
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
;
since
it
is
an
employment
which
depends
only
on
me
to
give
,
and
you
to
accept
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
again
paused
:
there
seemed
a
reluctance
to
continue
.
<EOS>
I
grew
impatient
:
<EOS>
a
restless
movement
or
two
,
and
an
eager
and
exacting
glance
fastened
on
his
face
,
conveyed
the
feeling
to
him
as
effectually
as
words
could
have
done
,
and
with
less
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
be
in
no
hurry
to
hear
,
"
he
said
:
"
let
me
frankly
tell
you
,
I
have
nothing
eligible
or
profitable
to
suggest
.
<EOS>
Before
I
explain
,
recall
,
if
you
please
,
my
notice
,
clearly
given
,
that
if
I
helped
you
,
it
must
be
as
the
blind
man
would
help
the
lame
.
<EOS>
I
am
poor
;
for
I
find
that
,
when
I
have
paid
my
father
's
debts
,
all
the
patrimony
remaining
to
me
will
be
this
crumbling
grange
,
the
row
of
scathed
firs
behind
,
and
the
patch
of
moorish
soil
,
with
the
yew
-
trees
and
holly
-
bushes
in
front
.
<EOS>
I
am
obscure
:
Rivers
is
an
old
name
;
but
of
the
three
sole
descendants
of
the
race
,
two
earn
the
dependant
's
crust
among
strangers
,
and
the
third
considers
himself
an
alien
from
his
native
country
 
not
only
for
life
,
but
in
death
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
deems
,
and
is
bound
to
deem
,
<EOS>
himself
honoured
by
the
lot
,
and
aspires
but
after
the
day
when
the
cross
of
separation
from
fleshly
ties
shall
be
laid
on
his
shoulders
,
and
when
the
Head
of
that
church
-
militant
of
whose
humblest
members
he
is
one
,
<EOS>
shall
give
the
word
,
"
Rise
,
follow
Me
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
St.
John
said
these
words
as
he
pronounced
his
sermons
,
with
a
quiet
,
deep
voice
;
with
an
unflushed
cheek
,
and
a
coruscating
radiance
of
glance
.
<EOS>
He
resumed
    
"
<EOS>
And
since
I
am
myself
poor
and
obscure
,
I
can
offer
you
but
a
service
of
poverty
and
obscurity
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
may
even
think
it
degrading
 
for
I
see
now
<EOS>
your
habits
have
been
what
the
world
calls
refined
:
your
tastes
lean
to
the
ideal
,
and
your
society
has
at
least
been
amongst
the
educated
;
but
_
I
_
consider
that
no
service
degrades
which
can
better
our
race
.
<EOS>
I
hold
that
the
more
arid
and
unreclaimed
the
soil
where
the
Christian
labourer
's
task
of
tillage
is
appointed
him
 
the
scantier
the
meed
his
toil
brings
 
the
higher
the
honour
.
<EOS>
His
,
under
such
circumstances
,
is
the
destiny
of
the
pioneer
;
and
the
first
pioneers
of
the
Gospel
were
the
Apostles
 
<EOS>
their
captain
was
Jesus
,
the
Redeemer
,
Himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
as
he
again
paused
 
"
proceed
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
before
he
proceeded
:
indeed
,
he
seemed
leisurely
to
read
my
face
,
as
if
its
features
and
lines
were
characters
on
a
page
.
<EOS>
The
conclusions
drawn
from
this
scrutiny
he
partially
expressed
in
his
succeeding
observations
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
will
accept
the
post
I
offer
you
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
hold
it
for
a
while
:
not
permanently
,
though
:
any
more
than
I
could
permanently
keep
the
narrow
and
narrowing
 
the
tranquil
,
hidden
office
of
English
country
incumbent
;
for
in
your
nature
is
an
alloy
as
detrimental
to
repose
as
that
in
mine
,
though
of
a
different
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
explain
,
"
I
urged
,
when
he
halted
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
;
and
you
shall
hear
how
poor
the
proposal
is
,
 
how
trivial
 
<EOS>
how
cramping
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
stay
long
at
Morton
,
now
that
my
father
is
dead
,
and
that
I
am
my
own
master
.
<EOS>
I
shall
leave
the
place
probably
in
the
course
of
a
twelve
-
month
;
but
while
I
do
stay
,
I
will
exert
myself
to
the
utmost
for
its
improvement
.
<EOS>
Morton
,
when
I
came
to
it
two
years
ago
,
had
no
school
:
the
children
of
the
poor
were
excluded
from
every
hope
of
progress
.
<EOS>
I
established
one
for
boys
:
I
mean
now
to
open
a
second
school
for
girls
.
<EOS>
I
have
hired
a
building
for
the
purpose
,
with
a
cottage
of
two
rooms
attached
to
it
for
the
mistress
's
house
.
<EOS>
Her
salary
will
be
thirty
pounds
a
year
:
<EOS>
her
house
is
already
furnished
,
very
simply
,
but
<EOS>
sufficiently
,
by
the
kindness
of
a
lady
,
Miss
Oliver
;
the
only
daughter
of
the
sole
rich
man
in
my
parish
 
Mr.
Oliver
,
the
proprietor
of
a
needle-
factory
and
iron
-
foundry
in
the
valley
.
<EOS>
The
same
lady
pays
for
the
education
and
clothing
of
an
orphan
from
the
workhouse
,
on
condition
that
she
shall
aid
the
mistress
in
such
menial
offices
connected
with
her
own
house
and
the
school
as
her
occupation
of
teaching
will
prevent
her
having
time
to
discharge
in
person
.
<EOS>
Will
you
be
this
mistress
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
the
question
rather
hurriedly
;
he
seemed
half
to
expect
an
indignant
,
or
at
least
a
disdainful
rejection
of
the
offer
:
not
knowing
all
my
thoughts
and
feelings
,
though
guessing
some
,
he
could
not
tell
in
what
light
the
lot
would
appear
to
me
.
<EOS>
In
truth
it
was
humble
 
<EOS>
but
then
it
was
sheltered
,
and
I
wanted
a
safe
asylum
<EOS>
:
it
was
plodding
 
but
then
,
compared
with
that
of
a
governess
in
a
rich
house
,
it
was
independent
;
and
the
fear
of
servitude
with
strangers
entered
my
soul
like
iron
:
it
was
not
ignoble
 
not
unworthy
 
not
mentally
degrading
,
I
made
my
decision
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
for
the
proposal
,
Mr.
Rivers
,
and
I
accept
it
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
comprehend
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
village
school
:
your
scholars
will
be
only
poor
girls
 
<EOS>
cottagers
'
children
 
at
the
best
,
farmers
'
daughters
.
<EOS>
Knitting
,
sewing
,
reading
,
writing
,
ciphering
,
will
be
all
you
will
have
to
teach
.
<EOS>
What
will
you
do
with
your
accomplishments
?
<EOS>
What
,
with
the
largest
portion
of
your
mind
 
sentiments
 
tastes
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Save
them
till
they
are
wanted
.
<EOS>
They
will
keep
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
you
undertake
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
now
smiled
:
and
not
a
bitter
or
a
sad
smile
,
but
one
well
pleased
and
deeply
gratified
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
will
you
commence
the
exercise
of
your
function
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
my
house
to
-
morrow
,
and
open
the
school
,
if
you
like
,
next
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
:
so
be
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
rose
and
walked
through
the
room
.
<EOS>
Standing
still
,
he
again
looked
at
me
.
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
disapprove
of
,
Mr.
Rivers
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
stay
at
Morton
long
:
<EOS>
no
,
no
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
What
is
your
reason
for
saying
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
read
it
in
your
eye
;
it
is
not
of
that
description
which
promises
the
maintenance
of
an
even
tenor
in
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
ambitious
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
started
at
the
word
"
ambitious
.
"
<EOS>
He
repeated
,
"
No
.
<EOS>
What
made
you
think
of
ambition
?
<EOS>
Who
is
ambitious
?
<EOS>
I
know
I
am
:
<EOS>
but
how
did
you
find
it
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
speaking
of
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
you
are
not
ambitious
,
you
are
 
"
<EOS>
He
paused
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
say
,
impassioned
:
<EOS>
but
perhaps
you
would
have
misunderstood
the
word
,
and
been
displeased
.
<EOS>
I
mean
,
that
human
affections
and
sympathies
have
a
most
powerful
hold
on
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
can
not
long
be
content
to
pass
your
leisure
in
solitude
,
and
to
devote
your
working
hours
to
a
monotonous
labour
wholly
void
of
stimulus
:
any
more
than
I
can
be
content
,
"
he
added
,
with
emphasis
,
"
to
live
here
buried
in
morass
,
pent
in
with
mountains
 
my
nature
,
that
God
gave
me
,
contravened
;
my
faculties
,
heaven
-
bestowed
,
paralysed
 
made
useless
.
<EOS>
You
hear
now
how
I
contradict
myself
.
<EOS>
I
,
who
preached
contentment
with
a
humble
lot
,
and
justified
the
vocation
even
of
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
in
God
's
service
 
I
,
His
ordained
minister
,
almost
rave
in
my
restlessness
.
<EOS>
Well
,
propensities
and
principles
must
be
reconciled
by
some
means
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
In
this
brief
hour
I
had
learnt
more
of
him
than
in
the
whole
previous
month
:
<EOS>
yet
still
he
puzzled
me
.
  
<EOS>
Diana
and
Mary
Rivers
became
more
sad
and
silent
as
the
day
approached
for
leaving
their
brother
and
their
home
.
<EOS>
They
both
tried
to
appear
as
usual
;
but
the
sorrow
they
had
to
struggle
against
was
one
that
could
not
be
entirely
conquered
or
concealed
.
<EOS>
Diana
intimated
that
this
would
be
a
different
parting
from
any
they
had
ever
yet
known
.
<EOS>
It
would
probably
,
as
far
as
St.
John
was
concerned
,
be
a
parting
for
years
:
it
might
be
a
parting
for
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
sacrifice
all
to
his
long
-
framed
resolves
,
"
she
said
:
"
natural
affection
and
feelings
more
potent
still
.
<EOS>
St.
John
looks
quiet
,
Jane
;
but
he
hides
a
fever
in
his
vitals
.
<EOS>
You
would
think
him
gentle
,
yet
in
some
things
he
is
inexorable
as
death
;
and
the
worst
of
it
is
,
my
conscience
will
hardly
permit
me
to
dissuade
him
from
his
severe
decision
:
certainly
,
I
can
not
for
a
moment
blame
him
for
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
right
,
noble
,
Christian
:
yet
it
breaks
my
heart
!
"
<EOS>
And
the
tears
gushed
to
her
fine
eyes
.
<EOS>
Mary
bent
her
head
low
over
her
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
now
without
father
:
we
shall
soon
be
without
home
and
brother
,
"
she
murmured
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
moment
a
little
accident
supervened
,
which
seemed
decreed
by
fate
purposely
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
adage
,
that
"
misfortunes
never
come
singly
,
"
and
to
add
to
their
distresses
the
vexing
one
of
the
slip
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
.
<EOS>
St.
John
passed
the
window
reading
a
letter
.
<EOS>
He
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
uncle
John
is
dead
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
Both
the
sisters
seemed
struck
:
not
shocked
or
appalled
;
the
tidings
appeared
in
their
eyes
rather
momentous
than
afflicting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dead
?
"
repeated
Diana
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
riveted
a
searching
gaze
on
her
brother
's
face
.
"
<EOS>
And
what
then
?
<EOS>
"
she
demanded
,
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
then
,
Die
?
"
<EOS>
he
replied
,
maintaining
a
marble
immobility
of
feature
.
<EOS>
"
What
then
?
<EOS>
Why
 
nothing
.
<EOS>
Read
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
threw
the
letter
into
her
lap
.
<EOS>
She
glanced
over
it
,
and
handed
it
to
Mary
.
<EOS>
Mary
perused
it
in
silence
,
and
returned
it
to
her
brother
.
<EOS>
All
three
looked
at
each
other
,
and
all
three
smiled
 
a
dreary
,
pensive
smile
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
Amen
!
<EOS>
We
can
yet
live
,
"
said
Diana
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
it
makes
us
no
worse
off
than
we
were
before
,
"
remarked
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
it
forces
rather
strongly
on
the
mind
the
picture
of
what
_
might
have
been
_
,
"
said
Mr.
Rivers
,
"
and
contrasts
it
somewhat
too
vividly
with
what
_
is
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
folded
the
letter
,
locked
it
in
his
desk
,
and
again
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
For
some
minutes
no
one
spoke
.
<EOS>
Diana
then
turned
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
you
will
wonder
at
us
and
our
mysteries
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
think
us
hard
-
hearted
beings
not
to
be
more
moved
at
the
death
of
so
near
a
relation
as
an
uncle
;
but
we
have
never
seen
him
or
known
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
my
mother
's
brother
.
<EOS>
My
father
and
he
quarrelled
long
ago
.
<EOS>
It
was
by
his
advice
that
my
father
risked
most
of
his
property
in
the
speculation
that
ruined
him
.
<EOS>
Mutual
recrimination
passed
between
them
:
they
parted
in
anger
,
and
were
never
reconciled
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
engaged
afterwards
in
more
prosperous
undertakings
:
it
appears
he
realised
a
fortune
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
He
was
never
married
,
and
had
no
near
kindred
but
ourselves
and
one
other
person
,
not
more
closely
related
than
we
.
<EOS>
My
father
always
cherished
the
idea
that
he
would
atone
for
his
error
by
leaving
his
possessions
to
us
;
that
letter
informs
us
that
he
has
bequeathed
every
penny
to
the
other
relation
,
with
the
exception
of
thirty
guineas
,
to
be
divided
between
St.
John
,
Diana
,
and
Mary
Rivers
,
for
the
purchase
of
three
mourning
rings
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
right
,
of
course
,
to
do
as
he
pleased
:
and
yet
a
momentary
damp
is
cast
on
the
spirits
by
the
receipt
of
such
news
.
<EOS>
Mary
and
I
would
have
esteemed
ourselves
rich
with
a
thousand
pounds
each
;
and
to
St.
John
such
a
sum
would
have
been
valuable
,
for
the
good
it
would
have
enabled
him
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
explanation
given
,
the
subject
was
dropped
,
and
no
further
reference
made
to
it
by
either
Mr.
Rivers
or
his
sisters
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
I
left
Marsh
End
for
Morton
.
<EOS>
The
day
after
,
Diana
and
Mary
quitted
it
for
distant
B-
.
<EOS>
In
a
week
,
Mr.
Rivers
and
Hannah
repaired
to
the
parsonage
:
and
so
the
old
grange
was
abandoned
.
    
<EOS>
My
home
,
then
,
when
I
at
last
find
a
home
,
 
is
a
cottage
;
a
little
room
with
whitewashed
walls
and
a
sanded
floor
,
containing
four
painted
chairs
and
a
table
,
a
clock
,
a
cupboard
,
with
two
or
three
plates
and
dishes
,
and
a
set
of
tea
-
things
in
delf
.
<EOS>
Above
,
a
chamber
of
the
same
dimensions
as
the
kitchen
,
with
a
deal
bedstead
and
chest
of
drawers
;
small
,
yet
too
large
to
be
filled
with
my
scanty
wardrobe
:
though
the
kindness
of
my
gentle
and
generous
friends
has
increased
that
,
by
a
modest
stock
of
such
things
as
are
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
evening
.
<EOS>
I
have
dismissed
,
with
the
fee
of
an
orange
,
the
little
orphan
who
serves
me
as
a
handmaid
.
<EOS>
I
am
sitting
alone
on
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
This
morning
,
the
village
school
opened
.
<EOS>
I
had
twenty
scholars
.
<EOS>
But
three
of
the
number
can
read
:
none
write
or
cipher
.
<EOS>
Several
knit
,
and
a
few
sew
a
little
.
<EOS>
They
speak
with
the
broadest
accent
of
the
district
.
<EOS>
At
present
,
they
and
I
have
a
difficulty
in
understanding
each
other
's
language
.
<EOS>
Some
of
them
are
unmannered
,
rough
,
intractable
,
as
well
as
ignorant
;
but
others
are
docile
,
have
a
wish
to
learn
,
and
evince
a
disposition
that
pleases
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
not
forget
that
these
coarsely
-
clad
little
peasants
are
of
flesh
and
blood
as
good
as
the
scions
of
gentlest
genealogy
;
and
that
the
germs
of
native
excellence
,
refinement
,
intelligence
,
kind
feeling
,
are
as
likely
to
exist
in
their
hearts
as
in
those
of
the
best
-
born
.
<EOS>
My
duty
will
be
to
develop
these
germs
:
surely
I
shall
find
some
happiness
in
discharging
that
office
.
<EOS>
Much
enjoyment
I
do
not
expect
in
the
life
opening
before
me
:
yet
it
will
,
doubtless
,
<EOS>
if
I
regulate
my
mind
,
and
exert
my
powers
as
I
ought
,
yield
me
enough
to
live
on
from
day
to
day
.
  
<EOS>
Was
I
very
gleeful
,
settled
,
content
,
during
the
hours
I
passed
in
yonder
bare
,
humble
schoolroom
this
morning
and
afternoon
?
<EOS>
Not
to
deceive
myself
,
I
must
reply
 
<EOS>
No
:
<EOS>
I
felt
desolate
to
a
degree
.
<EOS>
I
felt
 
<EOS>
yes
,
idiot
that
I
am
 
<EOS>
I
felt
degraded
.
<EOS>
I
doubted
I
had
taken
a
step
which
sank
instead
of
raising
me
in
the
scale
of
social
existence
.
<EOS>
I
was
weakly
dismayed
at
the
ignorance
,
the
poverty
,
the
coarseness
of
all
I
heard
and
saw
round
me
.
<EOS>
But
let
me
not
hate
and
despise
myself
too
much
for
these
feelings
;
I
know
them
to
be
wrong
 
<EOS>
that
is
a
great
step
gained
;
I
shall
strive
to
overcome
them
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
,
I
trust
,
I
shall
get
the
better
of
them
partially
;
and
in
a
few
weeks
,
perhaps
,
they
will
be
quite
subdued
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
months
,
it
is
possible
,
the
happiness
of
seeing
progress
,
and
a
change
for
the
better
in
my
scholars
may
substitute
gratification
for
disgust
.
  
<EOS>
Meantime
,
let
me
ask
myself
one
question
 
<EOS>
Which
is
better
?
 
<EOS>
To
have
surrendered
to
temptation
;
listened
to
passion
;
made
no
painful
effort
 
<EOS>
no
struggle
;
 
but
to
have
sunk
down
in
the
silken
snare
;
fallen
asleep
on
the
flowers
covering
it
;
wakened
in
a
southern
clime
,
amongst
the
luxuries
of
a
pleasure
villa
:
to
have
been
now
living
in
France
,
Mr.
Rochester
's
mistress
;
delirious
with
his
love
half
my
time
 
for
he
would
 
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
,
he
would
have
loved
me
well
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
He
_
<EOS>
did
_
love
me
 
<EOS>
no
one
will
ever
love
me
so
again
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
more
know
the
sweet
homage
given
to
beauty
,
youth
,
and
grace
 
for
never
to
any
one
else
<EOS>
shall
I
seem
to
possess
these
charms
.
<EOS>
He
was
fond
and
proud
of
me
 
<EOS>
it
is
what
no
man
besides
will
ever
be
.
 
<EOS>
But
where
am
I
wandering
,
and
what
am
I
saying
,
and
above
all
,
feeling
?
<EOS>
Whether
is
it
better
,
I
ask
,
to
be
a
slave
in
a
fool
's
paradise
at
Marseilles
 
fevered
with
delusive
bliss
one
hour
 
suffocating
with
the
bitterest
tears
of
remorse
and
shame
the
next
 
or
to
be
a
village
-
schoolmistress
,
free
and
honest
,
in
a
breezy
mountain
nook
in
the
healthy
heart
of
England
?
  
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
feel
now
that
I
was
right
when
I
adhered
to
principle
and
law
,
and
scorned
and
crushed
the
insane
promptings
of
a
frenzied
moment
.
<EOS>
God
directed
me
to
a
correct
choice
:
I
thank
His
providence
for
the
guidance
!
  
<EOS>
Having
brought
my
eventide
musings
to
this
point
,
I
rose
,
went
to
my
door
,
and
looked
at
the
sunset
of
the
harvest
-
day
,
and
at
the
quiet
fields
before
my
cottage
,
which
,
with
the
school
,
was
distant
half
a
mile
from
the
village
.
<EOS>
The
birds
were
singing
their
last
strains
    
<EOS>
"
The
air
was
mild
,
the
dew
was
balm
.
"
  
<EOS>
While
I
looked
,
I
thought
myself
happy
,
and
was
surprised
to
find
myself
ere
long
weeping
 
and
why
?
<EOS>
For
the
doom
which
had
reft
me
from
adhesion
to
my
master
:
for
him
I
was
no
more
to
see
;
for
the
desperate
grief
and
fatal
fury
 
consequences
of
my
departure
 
which
might
now
,
perhaps
,
be
dragging
him
from
the
path
of
right
,
too
far
to
leave
hope
of
ultimate
restoration
thither
.
<EOS>
At
this
thought
,
I
turned
my
face
aside
from
the
lovely
sky
of
eve
and
lonely
vale
of
Morton
 
<EOS>
I
say
_
lonely
_
,
for
in
that
bend
of
it
visible
to
me
<EOS>
there
was
no
building
apparent
save
the
church
and
the
parsonage
,
half
-
hid
in
trees
,
and
,
quite
at
the
extremity
,
the
roof
of
Vale
Hall
,
where
the
rich
Mr.
Oliver
and
his
daughter
lived
.
<EOS>
I
hid
my
eyes
,
and
leant
my
head
against
the
stone
frame
of
my
door
;
but
soon
a
slight
noise
near
the
wicket
which
shut
in
my
tiny
garden
from
the
meadow
beyond
it
made
me
look
up
.
<EOS>
A
dog
 
old
Carlo
,
Mr.
Rivers
'
pointer
,
as
I
saw
in
a
moment
 
was
pushing
the
gate
with
his
nose
,
and
St.
John
himself
leant
upon
it
with
folded
arms
;
his
brow
knit
,
his
gaze
,
grave
almost
to
displeasure
,
fixed
on
me
.
<EOS>
I
asked
him
to
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
can
not
stay
;
I
have
only
brought
you
a
little
parcel
my
sisters
left
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
contains
a
colour
-
box
,
pencils
,
and
paper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
approached
to
take
it
:
a
welcome
gift
it
was
.
<EOS>
He
examined
my
face
,
I
thought
,
with
austerity
,
as
I
came
near
:
the
traces
of
tears
were
doubtless
very
visible
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
found
your
first
day
's
work
harder
than
you
expected
?
"
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
I
think
in
time
I
shall
get
on
with
my
scholars
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
perhaps
your
accommodations
 
your
cottage
 
your
furniture
 
have
disappointed
your
expectations
?
<EOS>
They
are
,
in
truth
,
scanty
enough
;
but
 
"
I
interrupted
    
<EOS>
"
My
cottage
is
clean
and
weather
-
proof
;
my
furniture
sufficient
and
commodious
.
<EOS>
All
I
see
has
made
me
thankful
,
not
despondent
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
absolutely
such
a
fool
and
sensualist
as
to
regret
the
absence
of
a
carpet
,
a
sofa
,
and
silver
plate
;
besides
,
five
weeks
ago
I
had
nothing
 
<EOS>
I
was
an
outcast
,
a
beggar
,
a
vagrant
;
now
I
have
acquaintance
,
a
home
,
a
business
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
at
the
goodness
of
God
;
the
generosity
of
my
friends
;
the
bounty
of
my
lot
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
repine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
feel
solitude
an
oppression
?
<EOS>
The
little
house
there
behind
you
is
dark
and
empty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hardly
had
time
yet
to
enjoy
a
sense
of
tranquillity
,
much
less
to
grow
impatient
under
one
of
loneliness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
;
I
hope
you
feel
the
content
you
express
:
at
any
rate
,
your
good
sense
will
tell
you
that
it
is
too
soon
yet
to
yield
to
the
vacillating
fears
of
Lot
's
wife
.
<EOS>
What
you
had
left
before
I
saw
you
,
of
course
I
do
not
know
;
but
I
counsel
you
to
resist
firmly
every
temptation
which
would
incline
you
to
look
back
:
pursue
your
present
career
steadily
,
for
some
months
at
least
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
what
I
mean
to
do
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
St.
John
continued
    
<EOS>
"
It
is
hard
work
to
control
the
workings
of
inclination
and
turn
the
bent
of
nature
;
but
that
it
may
be
done
,
I
know
from
experience
.
<EOS>
God
has
given
us
,
in
a
measure
,
the
power
to
make
our
own
fate
;
and
when
our
energies
seem
to
demand
a
sustenance
they
can
not
get
 
when
our
will
strains
after
a
path
<EOS>
we
may
not
follow
 
<EOS>
we
need
neither
starve
from
inanition
,
nor
stand
still
in
despair
:
we
have
but
to
seek
another
nourishment
for
the
mind
,
as
strong
as
the
forbidden
food
it
longed
to
taste
 
and
perhaps
purer
;
and
to
hew
out
for
the
adventurous
foot
a
road
as
direct
and
broad
as
the
one
Fortune
has
blocked
up
against
us
,
if
rougher
than
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
year
ago
I
was
myself
intensely
miserable
,
because
I
thought
I
had
made
a
mistake
in
entering
the
ministry
:
its
uniform
duties
wearied
me
to
death
.
<EOS>
I
burnt
for
the
more
active
life
of
the
world
 
for
the
more
exciting
toils
of
a
literary
career
 
for
the
destiny
of
an
artist
,
author
,
orator
;
anything
rather
than
that
of
a
priest
:
<EOS>
yes
,
the
heart
of
a
politician
,
of
a
soldier
,
of
a
votary
of
glory
,
a
lover
of
renown
,
a
luster
after
power
,
beat
under
my
curate
's
surplice
.
<EOS>
I
considered
;
my
life
was
so
wretched
,
it
must
be
changed
,
or
I
must
die
.
<EOS>
After
a
season
of
darkness
and
struggling
,
light
broke
and
relief
fell
:
<EOS>
my
cramped
existence
all
at
once
spread
out
to
a
plain
without
bounds
 
<EOS>
my
powers
heard
a
call
from
heaven
to
rise
,
gather
their
full
strength
,
spread
their
wings
,
and
mount
beyond
ken
.
<EOS>
God
had
an
errand
for
me
;
to
bear
which
afar
,
to
deliver
it
well
,
skill
and
strength
,
courage
and
eloquence
,
the
best
qualifications
of
soldier
,
statesman
,
and
orator
,
were
all
needed
:
for
these
all
centre
in
the
good
missionary
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
missionary
I
resolved
to
be
.
<EOS>
From
that
moment
my
state
of
mind
changed
;
the
fetters
dissolved
and
dropped
from
every
faculty
,
leaving
nothing
of
bondage
but
its
galling
soreness
 
which
time
only
can
heal
.
<EOS>
My
father
,
indeed
,
imposed
the
determination
,
but
since
his
death
,
I
have
not
a
legitimate
obstacle
to
contend
with
;
some
affairs
settled
,
a
successor
for
Morton
provided
,
an
entanglement
or
two
of
the
feelings
broken
through
or
cut
asunder
 
a
last
conflict
with
human
weakness
,
in
which
I
know
I
shall
overcome
,
because
I
have
vowed
that
I
_
<EOS>
will
_
overcome
 
<EOS>
and
I
leave
Europe
for
the
East
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
said
this
,
in
his
peculiar
,
subdued
,
yet
emphatic
voice
;
looking
,
when
he
had
ceased
speaking
,
not
at
me
,
but
at
the
setting
sun
,
at
which
I
looked
too
.
<EOS>
Both
he
and
I
had
our
backs
towards
the
path
leading
up
the
field
to
the
wicket
.
<EOS>
We
had
heard
no
step
on
that
grass
-
grown
track
;
the
water
running
in
the
vale
was
the
one
lulling
sound
of
the
hour
and
scene
;
we
might
well
then
start
when
a
gay
voice
,
sweet
as
a
silver
bell
,
exclaimed
    
"
Good
evening
,
Mr.
Rivers
.
<EOS>
And
good
evening
,
old
Carlo
.
<EOS>
Your
dog
is
quicker
to
recognise
his
friends
than
you
are
,
sir
;
he
pricked
his
ears
and
wagged
his
tail
when
I
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
field
,
and
you
have
your
back
towards
me
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
true
.
<EOS>
Though
Mr.
Rivers
had
started
at
the
first
of
those
musical
accents
,
as
if
a
thunderbolt
had
split
a
cloud
over
his
head
,
he
stood
yet
,
at
the
close
of
the
sentence
,
in
the
same
attitude
in
which
the
speaker
had
surprised
him
 
his
arm
resting
on
the
gate
,
his
face
directed
towards
the
west
.
<EOS>
He
turned
at
last
,
with
measured
deliberation
.
<EOS>
A
vision
,
as
it
seemed
to
me
,
had
risen
at
his
side
.
<EOS>
There
appeared
,
within
three
feet
of
him
,
a
form
clad
in
pure
white
 
<EOS>
a
youthful
,
graceful
form
:
full
,
yet
fine
in
contour
;
and
when
,
after
bending
to
caress
Carlo
,
it
lifted
up
its
head
,
and
threw
back
a
long
veil
,
there
bloomed
under
his
glance
a
face
of
perfect
beauty
.
<EOS>
Perfect
beauty
is
a
strong
expression
;
but
I
do
not
retrace
or
qualify
it
:
as
sweet
features
as
ever
the
temperate
clime
of
Albion
moulded
;
as
pure
hues
of
rose
and
lily
as
ever
her
humid
gales
and
vapoury
skies
generated
and
screened
,
justified
,
in
this
instance
,
the
term
.
<EOS>
No
charm
was
wanting
,
no
defect
was
perceptible
;
the
young
girl
had
regular
and
delicate
lineaments
;
eyes
shaped
and
coloured
as
we
see
them
in
lovely
pictures
,
large
,
and
dark
,
and
full
;
the
long
and
shadowy
eyelash
which
encircles
a
fine
eye
with
so
soft
a
fascination
;
the
pencilled
brow
which
gives
such
clearness
;
the
white
smooth
forehead
,
which
adds
such
repose
to
the
livelier
beauties
of
tint
and
ray
;
the
cheek
oval
,
fresh
,
and
smooth
;
the
lips
,
fresh
too
,
ruddy
,
healthy
,
sweetly
formed
;
the
even
and
gleaming
teeth
without
flaw
;
the
small
dimpled
chin
;
the
ornament
of
rich
,
plenteous
tresses
 
<EOS>
all
advantages
,
in
short
,
which
,
combined
,
realise
the
ideal
of
beauty
,
were
fully
hers
.
<EOS>
I
wondered
,
as
I
looked
at
this
fair
creature
:
<EOS>
I
admired
her
with
my
whole
heart
.
<EOS>
Nature
had
surely
formed
her
in
a
partial
mood
;
and
,
forgetting
her
usual
stinted
step
-
mother
dole
of
gifts
,
had
endowed
this
,
her
darling
,
with
a
grand
-
dame
's
bounty
.
  
<EOS>
What
did
St.
John
Rivers
think
of
this
earthly
angel
?
<EOS>
I
naturally
asked
myself
that
question
as
I
saw
him
turn
to
her
and
look
at
her
;
and
,
as
naturally
,
I
sought
the
answer
to
the
inquiry
in
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
withdrawn
his
eye
from
the
Peri
,
and
was
looking
at
a
humble
tuft
of
daisies
which
grew
by
the
wicket
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
lovely
evening
,
but
<EOS>
late
for
you
to
be
out
alone
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
crushed
the
snowy
heads
of
the
closed
flowers
with
his
foot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
only
came
home
from
S-
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
(
she
mentioned
the
name
of
a
large
town
some
twenty
miles
distant
)
"
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Papa
told
me
you
had
opened
your
school
,
and
that
the
new
mistress
was
come
;
and
so
I
put
on
my
bonnet
after
tea
,
and
ran
up
the
valley
to
see
her
<EOS>
:
this
is
she
?
"
<EOS>
pointing
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
said
St.
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
you
shall
like
Morton
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
of
me
,
with
a
direct
and
naive
simplicity
of
tone
and
manner
,
pleasing
,
if
child
-
like
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
shall
.
<EOS>
I
have
many
inducements
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
find
your
scholars
as
attentive
as
you
expected
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Quite
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
like
your
house
?
"
  
"
Very
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
I
furnished
it
nicely
?
"
  
"
Very
nicely
,
indeed
.
"
  
"
And
made
a
good
choice
of
an
attendant
for
you
in
Alice
Wood
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
indeed
.
<EOS>
She
is
teachable
and
handy
.
"
<EOS>
(
This
then
,
I
thought
,
is
Miss
Oliver
,
the
heiress
;
<EOS>
favoured
,
it
seems
,
in
the
gifts
of
fortune
,
as
well
as
in
those
of
nature
!
<EOS>
What
happy
combination
of
the
planets
presided
over
her
birth
,
I
wonder
?
)
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
come
up
and
help
you
to
teach
sometimes
,
"
she
added
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
a
change
for
me
to
visit
you
now
and
then
;
and
I
like
a
change
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rivers
,
I
have
been
_
<EOS>
so
_
gay
during
my
stay
at
S-
.
<EOS>
Last
night
,
or
rather
this
morning
,
I
was
dancing
till
two
o'clock
.
<EOS>
The
th
regiment
are
stationed
there
since
the
riots
;
and
the
officers
are
the
most
agreeable
men
in
the
world
:
they
put
all
our
young
knife
-
grinders
and
scissor
merchants
to
shame
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
me
that
Mr.
St.
John
's
under
lip
protruded
,
and
his
upper
lip
curled
a
moment
.
<EOS>
His
mouth
certainly
looked
a
good
deal
compressed
,
and
the
lower
part
of
his
face
unusually
stern
and
square
,
as
the
laughing
girl
gave
him
this
information
.
<EOS>
He
lifted
his
gaze
,
too
,
from
the
daisies
,
and
turned
it
on
her
.
<EOS>
An
unsmiling
,
a
searching
,
a
meaning
gaze
<EOS>
it
was
.
<EOS>
She
answered
it
with
a
second
laugh
,
and
laughter
well
became
her
youth
,
her
roses
,
her
dimples
,
her
bright
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
stood
,
mute
and
grave
,
she
again
fell
to
caressing
Carlo
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Carlo
loves
me
,
"
said
she
.
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
is
not
stern
and
distant
to
his
friends
;
and
if
he
could
speak
,
he
would
not
be
silent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
patted
the
dog
's
head
,
bending
with
native
grace
before
his
young
and
austere
master
,
I
saw
a
glow
rise
to
that
master
's
face
.
<EOS>
I
saw
his
solemn
eye
melt
with
sudden
fire
,
and
flicker
with
resistless
emotion
.
<EOS>
Flushed
and
kindled
thus
,
he
looked
nearly
as
beautiful
for
a
man
as
she
for
a
woman
.
<EOS>
His
chest
heaved
once
,
as
if
his
large
heart
,
weary
of
despotic
constriction
,
had
expanded
,
despite
the
will
,
and
made
a
vigorous
bound
for
the
attainment
of
liberty
.
<EOS>
But
he
curbed
it
,
I
think
,
as
a
resolute
rider
would
curb
a
rearing
steed
.
<EOS>
He
responded
neither
by
word
nor
movement
to
the
gentle
advances
made
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
says
you
never
come
to
see
us
now
,
"
continued
Miss
Oliver
,
looking
up
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
a
stranger
at
Vale
Hall
.
<EOS>
He
is
alone
this
evening
,
and
not
very
well
:
will
you
return
with
me
and
visit
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
a
seasonable
hour
to
intrude
on
Mr.
Oliver
,
"
answered
St.
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
seasonable
hour
!
<EOS>
But
I
declare
it
is
.
<EOS>
It
is
just
the
hour
when
papa
most
wants
company
:
when
the
works
are
closed
and
he
has
no
business
to
occupy
him
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr.
Rivers
,
_
do
_
come
.
<EOS>
Why
are
you
so
very
shy
,
and
so
very
sombre
?
"
<EOS>
She
filled
up
the
hiatus
his
silence
left
by
a
reply
of
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
forgot
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
shaking
her
beautiful
curled
head
,
as
if
shocked
at
herself
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
giddy
and
thoughtless
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Do
_
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
It
had
slipped
my
memory
that
you
have
good
reasons
to
be
indisposed
for
joining
in
my
chatter
.
<EOS>
Diana
and
Mary
have
left
you
,
and
Moor
House
is
shut
up
,
and
you
are
so
lonely
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
pity
you
.
<EOS>
Do
come
and
see
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
to
-
night
,
Miss
Rosamond
,
not
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
St.
John
spoke
almost
like
an
automaton
:
<EOS>
himself
only
knew
the
effort
it
cost
him
thus
to
refuse
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
you
are
so
obstinate
,
I
will
leave
you
;
for
I
dare
not
stay
any
longer
:
the
dew
begins
to
fall
.
<EOS>
Good
evening
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
held
out
her
hand
.
<EOS>
He
just
touched
it
.
"
<EOS>
Good
evening
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
,
in
a
voice
low
and
hollow
as
an
echo
.
<EOS>
She
turned
,
but
in
a
moment
returned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
well
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
<EOS>
Well
might
she
put
the
question
:
his
face
was
blanched
as
her
gown
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
well
,
"
he
enunciated
;
and
,
with
a
bow
,
he
left
the
gate
.
<EOS>
She
went
one
way
;
he
another
.
<EOS>
She
turned
twice
to
gaze
after
him
as
she
tripped
fairy
-
like
down
the
field
;
he
,
as
he
strode
firmly
across
,
never
turned
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
This
spectacle
of
another
's
suffering
and
sacrifice
rapt
my
thoughts
from
exclusive
meditation
on
my
own
.
<EOS>
Diana
Rivers
had
designated
her
brother
"
inexorable
as
death
.
<EOS>
"
She
had
not
exaggerated
.
    
<EOS>
I
continued
the
labours
of
the
village
-
school
as
actively
and
faithfully
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
It
was
truly
hard
work
at
first
.
<EOS>
Some
time
elapsed
before
,
with
all
my
efforts
,
I
could
comprehend
my
scholars
and
their
nature
.
<EOS>
Wholly
untaught
,
with
faculties
quite
torpid
,
they
seemed
to
me
hopelessly
dull
;
and
,
at
first
sight
,
all
dull
alike
:
<EOS>
but
I
soon
found
I
was
mistaken
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
difference
amongst
them
as
amongst
the
educated
;
and
when
I
got
to
know
them
,
and
they
me
,
this
difference
rapidly
developed
itself
.
<EOS>
Their
amazement
at
me
,
my
language
,
my
rules
,
and
ways
,
once
subsided
,
I
found
some
of
these
heavy
-
looking
,
gaping
rustics
wake
up
into
sharp
-
witted
girls
enough
.
<EOS>
Many
showed
themselves
obliging
,
and
amiable
too
;
and
I
discovered
amongst
them
not
a
few
examples
of
natural
politeness
,
and
innate
self
-
respect
,
as
well
as
of
excellent
capacity
,
that
won
both
my
goodwill
and
my
admiration
.
<EOS>
These
soon
took
a
pleasure
in
doing
their
work
well
,
in
keeping
their
persons
neat
,
in
learning
their
tasks
regularly
,
in
acquiring
quiet
and
orderly
manners
.
<EOS>
The
rapidity
of
their
progress
,
in
some
instances
,
was
even
surprising
;
and
an
honest
and
happy
pride
I
took
in
it
:
besides
,
I
began
personally
to
like
some
of
the
best
girls
;
and
they
liked
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
amongst
my
scholars
several
farmers
'
daughters
:
young
women
grown
,
almost
.
<EOS>
These
could
already
read
,
write
,
and
sew
;
and
to
them
I
taught
the
elements
of
grammar
,
geography
,
history
,
and
the
finer
kinds
of
needlework
.
<EOS>
I
found
estimable
characters
amongst
them
 
characters
desirous
of
information
and
disposed
for
improvement
 
with
whom
I
passed
many
a
pleasant
evening
hour
in
their
own
homes
.
<EOS>
Their
parents
then
(
the
farmer
and
his
wife
)
loaded
me
with
attentions
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
enjoyment
in
accepting
their
simple
kindness
,
and
in
repaying
it
by
a
consideration
 
a
scrupulous
regard
to
their
feelings
 
to
which
they
were
not
,
perhaps
,
at
all
times
accustomed
,
and
which
both
charmed
and
benefited
them
;
because
,
while
it
elevated
them
in
their
own
eyes
,
it
made
them
emulous
to
merit
the
deferential
treatment
they
received
.
  
<EOS>
I
felt
I
became
a
favourite
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
Whenever
I
went
out
,
I
heard
on
all
sides
cordial
salutations
,
and
was
welcomed
with
friendly
smiles
.
<EOS>
To
live
amidst
general
regard
,
though
it
be
<EOS>
but
the
regard
of
working
people
,
is
like
"
sitting
in
sunshine
,
calm
and
sweet
;
"
serene
inward
feelings
bud
and
bloom
under
the
ray
.
<EOS>
At
this
period
of
my
life
,
my
heart
far
oftener
swelled
with
thankfulness
than
sank
with
dejection
:
and
yet
,
reader
,
to
tell
you
all
,
in
the
midst
of
this
calm
,
this
useful
existence
 
after
a
day
passed
in
honourable
exertion
amongst
my
scholars
,
an
evening
spent
in
drawing
or
reading
contentedly
alone
 
<EOS>
I
used
to
rush
into
strange
dreams
at
night
:
dreams
many
-
coloured
,
agitated
,
full
of
the
ideal
,
the
stirring
,
the
stormy
 
dreams
where
,
amidst
unusual
scenes
,
charged
with
adventure
,
with
agitating
risk
and
romantic
chance
,
I
still
again
and
again
met
Mr.
Rochester
,
always
at
some
exciting
crisis
;
and
then
the
sense
of
being
in
his
arms
,
hearing
his
voice
,
meeting
his
eye
,
touching
his
hand
and
cheek
,
loving
him
,
being
loved
by
him
 
the
hope
of
passing
a
lifetime
at
his
side
,
would
be
renewed
,
with
all
its
first
force
and
fire
.
<EOS>
Then
I
awoke
.
<EOS>
Then
I
recalled
where
I
was
,
and
how
situated
.
<EOS>
Then
I
rose
up
on
my
curtainless
bed
,
trembling
and
quivering
;
and
then
the
still
,
dark
night
witnessed
the
convulsion
of
despair
,
and
heard
the
burst
of
passion
.
<EOS>
By
nine
o'clock
the
next
morning
I
was
punctually
opening
the
school
;
tranquil
,
settled
,
prepared
for
the
steady
duties
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
Oliver
kept
her
word
in
coming
to
visit
me
.
<EOS>
Her
call
at
the
school
was
generally
made
in
the
course
of
her
morning
ride
.
<EOS>
She
would
canter
up
to
the
door
on
her
pony
,
followed
by
a
mounted
livery
servant
.
<EOS>
Anything
more
exquisite
than
her
appearance
,
in
her
purple
habit
,
with
her
Amazon
's
cap
of
black
velvet
placed
gracefully
above
the
long
curls
that
kissed
her
cheek
and
floated
to
her
shoulders
,
can
scarcely
be
imagined
:
and
it
was
thus
she
would
enter
the
rustic
building
,
and
glide
through
the
dazzled
ranks
of
the
village
children
.
<EOS>
She
generally
came
at
the
hour
when
Mr.
Rivers
was
engaged
in
giving
his
daily
catechising
lesson
.
<EOS>
Keenly
,
I
fear
,
did
the
eye
of
the
visitress
pierce
the
young
pastor
's
heart
.
<EOS>
A
sort
of
instinct
seemed
to
warn
him
of
her
entrance
,
even
when
he
did
not
see
it
;
and
when
he
was
looking
quite
away
from
the
door
,
if
she
appeared
at
it
,
his
cheek
would
glow
,
and
his
marble
-
seeming
features
,
though
they
refused
to
relax
,
changed
indescribably
,
and
in
their
very
quiescence
became
expressive
of
a
repressed
fervour
,
stronger
than
working
muscle
or
darting
glance
could
indicate
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
,
she
knew
her
power
:
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
did
not
,
because
he
could
not
,
conceal
it
from
her
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
Christian
stoicism
,
when
she
went
up
and
addressed
him
,
and
smiled
gaily
,
encouragingly
,
even
fondly
in
his
face
,
his
hand
would
tremble
and
his
eye
burn
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
say
,
with
his
sad
and
resolute
look
,
if
he
did
not
say
it
with
his
lips
,
"
I
love
you
,
and
I
know
you
prefer
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
despair
of
success
that
keeps
me
dumb
.
<EOS>
If
I
offered
my
heart
,
I
believe
you
would
accept
it
.
<EOS>
But
that
heart
is
already
laid
on
a
sacred
altar
:
the
fire
is
arranged
round
it
.
<EOS>
It
will
soon
be
no
more
than
a
sacrifice
consumed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
then
she
would
pout
like
a
disappointed
child
;
a
pensive
cloud
would
soften
her
radiant
vivacity
;
she
would
withdraw
her
hand
hastily
from
his
,
and
turn
in
transient
petulance
from
his
aspect
,
at
once
so
heroic
and
so
martyr
-
like
.
<EOS>
St.
John
,
no
doubt
,
would
have
given
the
world
to
follow
,
recall
,
retain
her
,
when
she
thus
left
him
;
but
he
would
not
give
one
chance
of
heaven
,
nor
relinquish
,
for
the
elysium
of
her
love
,
one
hope
of
the
true
,
eternal
Paradise
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
could
not
bind
all
that
he
had
in
his
nature
 
<EOS>
the
rover
,
the
aspirant
,
the
poet
,
the
priest
 
in
the
limits
of
a
single
passion
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
 
he
would
not
 
renounce
his
wild
field
of
mission
warfare
for
the
parlours
and
the
peace
of
Vale
Hall
.
<EOS>
I
learnt
so
much
from
himself
in
an
inroad
I
once
,
despite
his
reserve
,
had
the
daring
to
make
on
his
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Oliver
already
honoured
me
with
frequent
visits
to
my
cottage
.
<EOS>
I
had
learnt
her
whole
character
,
which
was
without
mystery
or
disguise
<EOS>
:
she
was
coquettish
but
not
heartless
;
exacting
,
but
not
worthlessly
selfish
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
indulged
from
her
birth
,
but
was
not
absolutely
spoilt
.
<EOS>
She
was
hasty
,
but
good
-
humoured
;
vain
<EOS>
(
she
could
not
help
it
,
when
every
glance
in
the
glass
showed
her
such
a
flush
of
loveliness
)
,
but
not
affected
;
liberal
-
handed
;
innocent
of
the
pride
of
wealth
;
ingenuous
;
sufficiently
intelligent
;
gay
,
lively
,
and
unthinking
:
she
was
very
charming
,
in
short
,
even
to
a
cool
observer
of
her
own
sex
like
me
;
but
she
was
not
profoundly
interesting
or
thoroughly
impressive
.
<EOS>
A
very
different
sort
of
mind
was
hers
from
that
,
for
instance
,
of
the
sisters
of
St.
John
.
<EOS>
Still
,
I
liked
her
almost
as
I
liked
my
pupil
Adele
;
except
that
,
for
a
child
whom
we
have
watched
over
and
taught
,
a
closer
affection
is
engendered
than
we
can
give
an
equally
attractive
adult
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
taken
an
amiable
caprice
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
said
I
was
like
Mr.
Rivers
,
only
,
certainly
,
she
allowed
,
"
not
one
-
tenth
<EOS>
so
handsome
,
though
I
was
a
nice
neat
little
soul
enough
,
but
he
was
an
angel
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
,
however
,
good
,
clever
,
composed
,
and
firm
,
like
him
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
_
lusus
naturae
_
<EOS>
,
she
affirmed
,
as
a
village
schoolmistress
:
she
was
sure
my
previous
history
,
if
known
,
would
make
a
delightful
romance
.
  
<EOS>
One
evening
,
while
,
with
her
usual
child
-
like
activity
,
and
thoughtless
yet
not
offensive
inquisitiveness
,
she
was
rummaging
the
cupboard
and
the
table
-
drawer
of
my
little
kitchen
,
she
discovered
first
two
French
books
,
a
volume
of
Schiller
,
a
German
grammar
and
dictionary
,
and
then
my
drawing
-
materials
and
some
sketches
,
including
a
pencil
-
head
of
a
pretty
little
cherub
-
like
girl
,
one
of
my
scholars
,
and
sundry
views
from
nature
,
taken
in
the
Vale
of
Morton
and
on
the
surrounding
moors
.
<EOS>
She
was
first
transfixed
with
surprise
,
and
then
electrified
with
delight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Had
I
done
these
pictures
?
<EOS>
Did
I
know
French
and
German
?
<EOS>
What
a
love
 
<EOS>
what
a
miracle
<EOS>
I
was
!
<EOS>
I
drew
better
than
her
master
in
the
first
school
in
S-
.
<EOS>
Would
I
sketch
a
portrait
of
her
,
to
show
to
papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
pleasure
,
"
I
replied
;
and
I
felt
a
thrill
of
artist
-
delight
at
the
idea
of
copying
from
so
perfect
and
radiant
a
model
.
<EOS>
She
had
then
on
a
dark
-
blue
silk
dress
;
her
arms
and
her
neck
were
bare
;
her
only
ornament
was
her
chestnut
tresses
,
which
waved
over
her
shoulders
with
all
the
wild
grace
of
natural
curls
.
<EOS>
I
took
a
sheet
of
fine
card
-
board
,
and
drew
a
careful
outline
.
<EOS>
I
promised
myself
the
pleasure
of
colouring
it
;
and
,
as
it
was
getting
late
then
,
I
told
her
she
must
come
and
sit
another
day
.
  
<EOS>
She
made
such
a
report
of
me
to
her
father
,
that
Mr.
Oliver
himself
accompanied
her
next
evening
 
<EOS>
a
tall
,
massive
-
featured
,
middle
-
aged
,
and
grey
-
headed
man
,
at
whose
side
his
lovely
daughter
looked
like
a
bright
flower
near
a
hoary
turret
.
<EOS>
He
appeared
a
taciturn
,
and
perhaps
a
proud
personage
;
but
he
was
very
kind
to
me
.
<EOS>
The
sketch
of
Rosamond
's
portrait
pleased
him
highly
:
he
said
I
must
make
a
finished
picture
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
insisted
,
too
,
on
my
coming
the
next
day
to
spend
the
evening
at
Vale
Hall
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
.
<EOS>
I
found
it
a
large
,
handsome
residence
,
showing
abundant
evidences
of
wealth
in
the
proprietor
.
<EOS>
Rosamond
was
full
of
glee
and
pleasure
all
the
time
I
stayed
.
<EOS>
Her
father
was
affable
;
and
when
he
entered
into
conversation
with
me
after
tea
,
he
expressed
in
strong
terms
his
approbation
of
what
I
had
done
in
Morton
school
,
and
said
he
only
feared
,
from
what
he
saw
and
heard
,
I
was
too
good
for
the
place
,
and
would
soon
quit
it
for
one
more
suitable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
"
cried
Rosamond
,
"
she
is
clever
enough
to
be
a
governess
in
a
high
family
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
I
would
far
rather
be
where
I
am
than
in
any
high
family
in
the
land
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Oliver
spoke
of
Mr.
Rivers
 
of
the
Rivers
family
 
with
great
respect
.
<EOS>
He
said
it
was
a
very
old
name
in
that
neighbourhood
;
that
the
ancestors
of
the
house
were
wealthy
;
that
all
Morton
had
once
belonged
to
them
;
that
even
now
he
considered
the
representative
of
that
house
might
,
if
he
liked
,
make
an
alliance
with
the
best
.
<EOS>
He
accounted
it
a
pity
that
so
fine
and
talented
a
young
man
should
have
formed
the
design
of
going
out
as
a
missionary
;
it
was
quite
throwing
a
valuable
life
away
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
,
then
,
that
her
father
would
throw
no
obstacle
in
the
way
of
Rosamond
's
union
with
St.
John
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Oliver
evidently
regarded
the
young
clergyman
's
good
birth
,
old
name
,
and
sacred
profession
as
sufficient
compensation
for
the
want
of
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
5th
of
November
,
and
a
holiday
.
<EOS>
My
little
servant
,
after
helping
me
to
clean
my
house
,
was
gone
,
well
satisfied
with
the
fee
of
a
penny
for
her
aid
.
<EOS>
All
about
me
was
spotless
and
bright
 
scoured
floor
,
polished
grate
,
and
well
-
rubbed
chairs
.
<EOS>
I
had
also
made
myself
neat
,
and
had
now
the
afternoon
before
me
to
spend
as
I
would
.
  
<EOS>
The
translation
of
a
few
pages
of
German
occupied
an
hour
;
then
I
got
my
palette
and
pencils
,
and
fell
to
the
more
soothing
,
because
easier
occupation
,
of
completing
Rosamond
Oliver
's
miniature
.
<EOS>
The
head
was
finished
already
:
there
was
but
the
background
to
tint
and
the
drapery
to
shade
off
;
a
touch
of
carmine
,
too
,
to
add
to
the
ripe
lips
 
a
soft
curl
here
and
there
to
the
tresses
 
a
deeper
tinge
to
the
shadow
of
the
lash
under
the
azured
eyelid
.
<EOS>
I
was
absorbed
in
the
execution
of
these
nice
details
,
when
,
after
one
rapid
tap
,
my
door
unclosed
,
admitting
St.
John
Rivers
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
to
see
how
you
are
spending
your
holiday
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Not
,
I
hope
,
in
thought
?
<EOS>
No
,
that
is
well
:
while
you
draw
you
will
not
feel
lonely
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
I
mistrust
you
still
,
though
you
have
borne
up
wonderfully
so
far
.
<EOS>
I
have
brought
you
a
book
for
evening
solace
,
"
and
he
laid
on
the
table
a
new
publication
 
<EOS>
a
poem
:
<EOS>
one
of
those
genuine
productions
so
often
vouchsafed
to
the
fortunate
public
of
those
days
 
the
golden
age
of
modern
literature
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
the
readers
of
our
era
are
less
favoured
.
<EOS>
But
courage
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
pause
either
to
accuse
or
repine
.
<EOS>
I
know
poetry
is
not
dead
,
nor
genius
lost
;
nor
has
Mammon
gained
power
over
either
,
to
bind
or
slay
:
they
will
both
assert
their
existence
,
their
presence
,
their
liberty
and
strength
again
one
day
.
<EOS>
Powerful
angels
,
safe
in
heaven
!
<EOS>
they
smile
when
sordid
souls
triumph
,
and
feeble
ones
weep
over
their
destruction
.
<EOS>
Poetry
destroyed
?
<EOS>
Genius
banished
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
Mediocrity
,
no
<EOS>
:
do
not
let
envy
prompt
you
to
the
thought
.
<EOS>
No
;
they
not
only
live
,
but
reign
and
redeem
:
<EOS>
and
without
their
divine
influence
spread
everywhere
,
you
would
be
in
hell
 
the
hell
of
your
own
meanness
.
  
<EOS>
While
I
was
eagerly
glancing
at
the
bright
pages
of
"
Marmion
"
(
for
"
Marmion
"
it
was
)
,
St.
John
stooped
to
examine
my
drawing
.
<EOS>
His
tall
figure
sprang
erect
again
with
a
start
<EOS>
:
he
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
looked
up
at
him
:
he
shunned
my
eye
.
<EOS>
I
knew
his
thoughts
well
,
and
could
read
his
heart
plainly
;
at
the
moment
I
felt
calmer
and
cooler
than
he
:
I
had
then
temporarily
the
advantage
of
him
,
and
I
conceived
an
inclination
to
do
him
some
good
,
if
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
With
all
his
firmness
and
self
-
control
,
"
thought
I
,
"
he
tasks
himself
too
far
:
locks
every
feeling
and
pang
within
 
expresses
,
confesses
,
imparts
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
would
benefit
him
to
talk
a
little
about
this
sweet
Rosamond
,
whom
he
thinks
he
ought
not
to
marry
:
I
will
make
him
talk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
said
first
,
"
Take
a
chair
,
Mr.
Rivers
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
answered
,
as
he
always
did
,
that
he
could
not
stay
.
"
<EOS>
Very
well
,
"
I
responded
,
mentally
,
"
stand
if
you
like
;
but
you
shall
not
go
just
yet
<EOS>
,
I
am
determined
:
solitude
is
at
least
as
bad
for
you
as
it
is
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
'll
try
if
I
can
not
discover
the
secret
spring
of
your
confidence
,
and
find
an
aperture
in
that
marble
breast
through
which
I
can
shed
one
drop
of
the
balm
of
sympathy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
this
portrait
like
?
"
<EOS>
I
asked
bluntly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Like
!
<EOS>
Like
whom
?
<EOS>
I
did
not
observe
it
closely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
,
Mr.
Rivers
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
almost
started
at
my
sudden
and
strange
abruptness
:
he
looked
at
me
astonished
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
is
nothing
yet
,
"
I
muttered
within
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
to
be
baffled
by
a
little
stiffness
on
your
part
;
I
'm
prepared
to
go
to
considerable
lengths
.
<EOS>
"
I
continued
,
"
You
observed
it
closely
and
distinctly
;
but
I
have
no
objection
to
your
looking
at
it
again
,
"
and
I
rose
and
placed
it
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
well
-
executed
picture
,
"
he
said
;
"
very
soft
,
clear
colouring
;
very
graceful
and
correct
drawing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
;
I
know
all
that
.
<EOS>
But
what
of
the
resemblance
?
<EOS>
Who
is
it
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mastering
some
hesitation
,
he
answered
,
"
Miss
Oliver
,
I
presume
.
"
  
"
Of
course
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
sir
,
to
reward
you
for
the
accurate
guess
,
I
will
promise
to
paint
you
a
careful
and
faithful
duplicate
of
this
very
picture
,
provided
you
admit
that
the
gift
would
be
acceptable
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wish
to
throw
away
my
time
and
trouble
on
an
offering
you
would
deem
worthless
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
continued
to
gaze
at
the
picture
:
the
longer
he
looked
,
the
firmer
he
held
it
,
<EOS>
the
more
he
seemed
to
covet
it
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
like
!
"
<EOS>
he
murmured
;
"
the
eye
is
well
managed
:
the
colour
,
light
,
expression
,
are
perfect
.
<EOS>
It
smiles
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
it
comfort
,
or
would
it
wound
you
to
have
a
similar
painting
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
that
.
<EOS>
When
you
are
at
Madagascar
,
or
at
the
Cape
,
or
in
India
,
would
it
be
a
consolation
to
have
that
memento
in
your
possession
?
<EOS>
or
would
the
sight
of
it
bring
recollections
calculated
to
enervate
and
distress
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
now
furtively
raised
his
eyes
:
he
glanced
at
me
,
irresolute
,
disturbed
:
he
again
surveyed
the
picture
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
should
like
to
have
it
is
certain
:
whether
it
would
be
judicious
or
wise
is
another
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
Since
I
had
ascertained
that
Rosamond
really
preferred
him
,
and
that
her
father
was
not
likely
to
oppose
the
match
,
I
 
less
exalted
in
my
views
than
St.
John
 
had
been
strongly
disposed
in
my
own
heart
to
advocate
their
union
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
me
that
,
should
he
become
the
possessor
of
Mr.
Oliver
's
large
fortune
,
he
might
do
as
much
good
with
it
as
if
he
went
and
laid
his
genius
out
to
wither
,
and
his
strength
to
waste
,
under
a
tropical
sun
.
<EOS>
With
this
persuasion
I
now
answered
    
"
As
far
as
I
can
see
,
it
would
be
wiser
and
more
judicious
if
you
were
to
take
to
yourself
the
original
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
he
had
sat
down
:
he
had
laid
the
picture
on
the
table
before
him
,
and
with
his
brow
supported
on
both
hands
,
hung
fondly
over
it
.
<EOS>
I
discerned
he
was
now
neither
angry
nor
shocked
at
my
audacity
.
<EOS>
I
saw
even
that
to
be
thus
frankly
addressed
on
a
subject
he
had
deemed
unapproachable
 
to
hear
it
thus
freely
handled
 
was
beginning
to
be
felt
by
him
as
a
new
pleasure
 
an
unhoped
-
for
relief
.
<EOS>
Reserved
people
often
really
need
the
frank
discussion
of
their
sentiments
and
griefs
more
than
the
expansive
.
<EOS>
The
sternest
-
seeming
stoic
is
human
after
all
;
and
to
"
burst
"
with
boldness
and
good
-
will
into
"
the
silent
sea
"
of
their
souls
is
often
to
confer
on
them
the
first
of
obligations
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
likes
you
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
I
,
as
I
stood
behind
his
chair
,
"
and
her
father
respects
you
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
she
is
a
sweet
girl
 
rather
thoughtless
;
but
you
would
have
sufficient
thought
for
both
yourself
and
her
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
marry
her
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Does
_
she
like
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
;
better
than
she
likes
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
She
talks
of
you
continually
<EOS>
:
there
is
no
subject
she
enjoys
so
much
or
touches
upon
so
often
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
pleasant
to
hear
this
,
"
he
said
 
"
very
:
go
on
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
actually
took
out
his
watch
and
laid
it
upon
the
table
to
measure
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
where
is
the
use
of
going
on
,
"
I
asked
,
"
when
you
are
probably
preparing
some
iron
blow
of
contradiction
,
or
forging
a
fresh
chain
to
fetter
your
heart
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
imagine
such
hard
things
.
<EOS>
Fancy
me
yielding
and
melting
,
as
I
am
doing
:
human
love
rising
like
a
freshly
opened
fountain
in
my
mind
and
overflowing
with
sweet
inundation
all
the
field
I
have
so
carefully
and
with
such
labour
<EOS>
prepared
 
so
assiduously
sown
with
the
seeds
of
good
intentions
,
of
self
-
denying
plans
.
<EOS>
And
now
it
is
deluged
with
a
nectarous
flood
 
<EOS>
the
young
germs
swamped
 
delicious
poison
cankering
them
:
now
I
see
myself
stretched
on
an
ottoman
in
the
drawing
-
room
at
Vale
Hall
at
my
bride
Rosamond
Oliver
's
feet
:
she
is
talking
to
me
with
her
sweet
voice
 
gazing
down
on
me
with
those
eyes
<EOS>
your
skilful
hand
has
copied
so
well
 
smiling
at
me
with
these
coral
lips
.
<EOS>
She
is
mine
 
<EOS>
I
am
hers
 
<EOS>
this
present
life
and
passing
world
suffice
to
me
.
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
say
nothing
 
<EOS>
my
heart
is
full
of
delight
 
<EOS>
my
senses
are
entranced
 
<EOS>
let
the
time
I
marked
pass
in
peace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
humoured
him
:
the
watch
ticked
on
<EOS>
:
he
breathed
fast
and
low
:
I
stood
silent
.
<EOS>
Amidst
this
hush
the
quartet
sped
;
he
replaced
the
watch
,
laid
the
picture
down
,
rose
,
and
stood
on
the
hearth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
little
space
was
given
to
delirium
and
delusion
.
<EOS>
I
rested
my
temples
on
the
breast
of
temptation
,
and
put
my
neck
voluntarily
under
her
yoke
of
flowers
.
<EOS>
I
tasted
her
cup
.
<EOS>
The
pillow
was
burning
:
there
is
an
asp
in
the
garland
:
the
wine
has
a
bitter
taste
:
her
promises
are
hollow
 
<EOS>
her
offers
false
<EOS>
:
I
see
and
know
all
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
gazed
at
him
in
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
strange
,
"
pursued
he
,
"
that
while
I
love
Rosamond
Oliver
so
wildly
 
with
all
the
intensity
,
indeed
,
of
a
first
passion
,
the
object
of
which
is
exquisitely
beautiful
,
graceful
,
fascinating
 
<EOS>
I
experience
at
the
same
time
a
calm
,
unwarped
consciousness
that
she
would
not
make
me
a
good
wife
;
that
she
is
not
the
partner
suited
to
me
;
that
I
should
discover
this
within
a
year
after
marriage
;
and
that
to
twelve
months
'
rapture
would
succeed
a
lifetime
of
regret
.
<EOS>
This
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Strange
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
help
ejaculating
.
  
<EOS>
"
While
something
in
me
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
is
acutely
sensible
to
her
charms
,
something
else
is
as
deeply
impressed
with
her
defects
:
they
are
such
that
she
could
sympathise
in
nothing
I
aspired
to
 
co
-
operate
in
nothing
I
undertook
.
<EOS>
Rosamond
a
sufferer
,
a
labourer
,
a
female
apostle
?
<EOS>
Rosamond
a
missionary
's
wife
?
<EOS>
No
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
need
not
be
a
missionary
.
<EOS>
You
might
relinquish
that
scheme
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Relinquish
!
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
my
vocation
?
<EOS>
My
great
work
?
<EOS>
My
foundation
laid
on
earth
for
a
mansion
in
heaven
?
<EOS>
My
hopes
of
being
numbered
in
the
band
who
have
merged
all
ambitions
in
the
glorious
one
of
bettering
their
race
 
of
carrying
knowledge
into
the
realms
of
ignorance
 
of
substituting
peace
for
war
 
freedom
for
bondage
 
religion
for
superstition
 
<EOS>
the
hope
of
heaven
for
the
fear
of
hell
?
<EOS>
Must
I
relinquish
that
?
<EOS>
It
is
dearer
than
the
blood
in
my
veins
.
<EOS>
It
is
what
I
have
to
look
forward
to
,
and
to
live
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
a
considerable
pause
,
I
said
 
"
And
Miss
Oliver
?
<EOS>
Are
her
disappointment
and
sorrow
of
no
interest
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Oliver
is
ever
surrounded
by
suitors
and
flatterers
:
in
less
than
a
month
,
my
image
will
be
effaced
from
her
heart
.
<EOS>
She
will
forget
me
;
and
will
marry
,
probably
,
some
one
who
will
make
her
far
happier
than
I
should
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
speak
coolly
enough
;
but
you
suffer
in
the
conflict
.
<EOS>
You
are
wasting
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
If
I
get
a
little
thin
,
it
is
with
anxiety
about
my
prospects
,
yet
unsettled
 
my
departure
,
continually
procrastinated
.
<EOS>
Only
this
morning
,
I
received
intelligence
that
the
successor
,
whose
arrival
I
have
been
so
long
expecting
,
can
not
be
ready
to
replace
me
for
three
months
to
come
yet
;
and
perhaps
the
three
months
may
extend
to
six
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
tremble
and
become
flushed
whenever
Miss
Oliver
enters
the
schoolroom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Again
the
surprised
expression
crossed
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
imagined
that
a
woman
would
dare
to
speak
so
to
a
man
.
<EOS>
For
me
,
I
felt
at
home
in
this
sort
of
discourse
.
<EOS>
I
could
never
rest
in
communication
with
strong
,
discreet
,
and
refined
minds
,
whether
male
or
female
,
till
I
had
passed
the
outworks
of
conventional
reserve
,
and
crossed
the
threshold
of
confidence
,
and
won
a
place
by
their
heart
's
very
hearthstone
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
original
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
not
timid
.
<EOS>
There
is
something
brave
in
your
spirit
,
as
well
as
penetrating
in
your
eye
;
but
allow
me
to
assure
you
that
you
partially
misinterpret
my
emotions
.
<EOS>
You
think
them
more
profound
and
potent
than
they
are
.
<EOS>
You
give
me
a
larger
allowance
of
sympathy
than
I
have
a
just
claim
to
.
<EOS>
When
I
colour
,
and
when
I
shade
before
Miss
Oliver
,
I
do
not
pity
myself
.
<EOS>
I
scorn
the
weakness
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
is
ignoble
:
a
mere
fever
of
the
flesh
:
<EOS>
not
,
I
declare
,
the
convulsion
of
the
soul
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
That
_
is
just
as
fixed
as
a
rock
,
firm
set
in
the
depths
of
a
restless
sea
.
<EOS>
Know
me
to
be
what
I
am
 
a
cold
hard
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
smiled
incredulously
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
taken
my
confidence
by
storm
,
"
he
continued
,
"
and
now
it
is
much
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
I
am
simply
,
in
my
original
state
 
stripped
of
that
blood
-
bleached
robe
with
which
Christianity
covers
human
deformity
 
a
cold
,
hard
,
ambitious
man
.
<EOS>
Natural
affection
only
,
of
all
the
sentiments
,
has
permanent
power
over
me
.
<EOS>
Reason
,
and
not
feeling
,
is
my
guide
;
my
ambition
is
unlimited
:
my
desire
to
rise
higher
,
to
do
more
than
others
,
insatiable
.
<EOS>
I
honour
endurance
,
perseverance
,
industry
,
talent
;
because
these
are
the
means
by
which
men
achieve
great
ends
and
mount
to
lofty
eminence
.
<EOS>
I
watch
your
career
with
interest
,
because
I
consider
you
a
specimen
of
a
diligent
,
orderly
,
energetic
woman
:
not
because
I
deeply
compassionate
what
you
have
gone
through
,
or
what
you
still
suffer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
describe
yourself
as
a
mere
pagan
philosopher
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
There
is
this
difference
between
me
and
deistic
philosophers
:
I
believe
;
and
I
believe
the
Gospel
.
<EOS>
You
missed
your
epithet
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
pagan
,
but
a
Christian
philosopher
 
a
follower
of
the
sect
of
Jesus
.
<EOS>
As
His
disciple
I
adopt
His
pure
,
<EOS>
His
merciful
,
His
benignant
doctrines
.
<EOS>
I
advocate
them
:
I
am
sworn
to
spread
them
.
<EOS>
Won
in
youth
to
religion
,
she
has
cultivated
my
original
qualities
thus
:
 
From
the
minute
germ
,
natural
affection
,
she
has
developed
the
overshadowing
tree
,
philanthropy
.
<EOS>
From
the
wild
stringy
root
of
human
uprightness
,
she
has
reared
a
due
sense
of
the
Divine
justice
.
<EOS>
Of
the
ambition
to
win
power
and
renown
for
my
wretched
self
,
she
has
formed
the
ambition
to
spread
my
Master
's
kingdom
;
to
achieve
victories
for
the
standard
of
the
cross
.
<EOS>
So
much
has
religion
done
for
me
;
turning
the
original
materials
to
the
best
account
;
pruning
and
training
nature
.
<EOS>
But
she
could
not
eradicate
nature
:
nor
will
it
be
eradicated
'
till
this
mortal
shall
put
on
immortality
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Having
said
this
,
he
took
his
hat
,
which
lay
on
the
table
beside
my
palette
.
<EOS>
Once
more
he
looked
at
the
portrait
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
_
is
<EOS>
_
lovely
,
"
he
murmured
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
well
named
the
Rose
of
the
World
,
indeed
!
"
  
"
And
may
I
not
paint
one
like
it
for
you
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
_
Cui
bono
_
?
<EOS>
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
drew
over
the
picture
the
sheet
of
thin
paper
on
which
I
was
accustomed
to
rest
my
hand
in
painting
,
to
prevent
the
cardboard
from
being
sullied
.
<EOS>
What
he
suddenly
saw
on
this
blank
paper
,
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
tell
;
but
something
had
caught
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
took
it
up
with
a
snatch
;
he
looked
at
the
edge
;
then
shot
a
glance
at
me
,
inexpressibly
peculiar
,
and
quite
incomprehensible
:
a
glance
that
seemed
to
take
and
make
note
of
every
point
in
my
shape
,
face
,
and
dress
;
for
it
traversed
all
,
quick
,
keen
as
lightning
.
<EOS>
His
lips
parted
,
as
if
to
speak
:
but
he
checked
the
coming
sentence
,
whatever
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
in
the
world
,
"
was
the
reply
;
and
,
replacing
the
paper
,
I
saw
him
dexterously
tear
a
narrow
slip
from
the
margin
.
<EOS>
It
disappeared
in
his
glove
;
and
,
with
one
hasty
nod
and
"
good
-
afternoon
,
"
he
vanished
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
,
using
an
expression
of
the
district
,
"
that
caps
the
globe
,
however
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
,
in
my
turn
,
scrutinised
the
paper
;
but
saw
nothing
on
it
save
a
few
dingy
stains
of
paint
where
I
had
tried
the
tint
in
my
pencil
.
<EOS>
I
pondered
the
mystery
a
minute
or
two
;
but
finding
it
insolvable
,
and
being
certain
it
could
not
be
of
much
moment
,
I
dismissed
,
and
soon
forgot
it
.
    
<EOS>
When
Mr.
St.
John
went
,
it
was
beginning
to
snow
;
the
whirling
storm
continued
all
night
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
a
keen
wind
brought
fresh
and
blinding
falls
;
by
twilight
the
valley
was
drifted
up
and
almost
impassable
.
<EOS>
I
had
closed
my
shutter
,
laid
a
mat
to
the
door
to
prevent
the
snow
from
blowing
in
under
it
,
trimmed
my
fire
,
and
after
sitting
nearly
an
hour
on
the
hearth
listening
to
the
muffled
fury
of
the
tempest
,
I
lit
a
candle
,
took
down
"
Marmion
,
"
and
beginning
    
"
Day
set
on
Norham
's
castled
steep
,
And
Tweed
's
fair
river
broad
and
deep
,
And
Cheviot
's
mountains
lone
;
The
massive
towers
,
the
donjon
keep
,
The
flanking
walls
that
round
them
sweep
,
In
yellow
lustre
shone
"
    
<EOS>
I
soon
forgot
storm
in
music
.
  
<EOS>
I
heard
a
noise
:
<EOS>
the
wind
,
I
thought
,
shook
the
door
.
<EOS>
No
;
it
was
St.
John
Rivers
,
who
,
lifting
the
latch
,
came
in
out
of
the
frozen
hurricane
 
the
howling
darkness
 
and
stood
before
me
:
the
cloak
that
covered
his
tall
figure
all
white
as
a
glacier
.
<EOS>
I
was
almost
in
consternation
,
so
little
<EOS>
had
I
expected
any
guest
from
the
blocked
-
up
vale
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Any
ill
news
?
<EOS>
"
I
demanded
.
<EOS>
"
Has
anything
happened
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
How
very
easily
alarmed
you
are
!
"
<EOS>
he
answered
,
removing
his
cloak
and
hanging
it
up
against
the
door
,
towards
which
he
again
coolly
pushed
the
mat
which
his
entrance
had
deranged
.
<EOS>
He
stamped
the
snow
from
his
boots
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
sully
the
purity
of
your
floor
,
"
said
he
,
"
but
you
must
excuse
me
for
once
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
approached
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
hard
work
to
get
here
,
I
assure
you
,
"
he
observed
,
as
he
warmed
his
hands
over
the
flame
.
"
<EOS>
One
drift
took
me
up
to
the
waist
;
happily
the
snow
is
quite
soft
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
are
you
come
?
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
forbear
saying
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rather
an
inhospitable
question
to
put
to
a
visitor
;
but
since
you
ask
it
,
I
answer
simply
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
;
I
got
tired
of
my
mute
books
and
empty
rooms
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
since
yesterday
I
have
experienced
the
excitement
of
a
person
to
whom
a
tale
has
been
half
-
told
,
and
who
is
impatient
to
hear
the
sequel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
sat
down
.
<EOS>
I
recalled
his
singular
conduct
of
yesterday
,
and
really
I
began
to
fear
his
wits
were
touched
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
insane
,
however
,
his
was
a
very
cool
and
collected
insanity
:
I
had
never
seen
that
handsome
-
featured
face
of
his
look
more
like
chiselled
marble
than
it
did
just
now
,
as
he
put
aside
his
snow
-
wet
hair
from
his
forehead
and
let
the
firelight
shine
free
on
his
pale
brow
and
cheek
as
pale
,
where
it
grieved
me
to
discover
the
hollow
trace
of
care
or
sorrow
now
so
plainly
graved
.
<EOS>
I
waited
,
expecting
he
would
say
something
I
could
at
least
comprehend
;
but
his
hand
was
now
at
his
chin
,
his
finger
on
his
lip
:
he
was
thinking
.
<EOS>
It
struck
me
that
his
hand
looked
wasted
like
his
face
.
<EOS>
A
perhaps
uncalled
-
for
gush
of
pity
came
over
my
heart
:
I
was
moved
to
say
    
"
I
wish
Diana
or
Mary
would
come
and
live
with
you
:
<EOS>
it
is
too
bad
that
you
should
be
quite
alone
;
and
you
are
recklessly
rash
about
your
own
health
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
said
he
:
"
I
care
for
myself
when
necessary
.
<EOS>
I
am
well
now
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
see
amiss
in
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
said
with
a
careless
,
abstracted
indifference
,
which
showed
that
my
solicitude
was
,
at
least
in
his
opinion
,
wholly
superfluous
.
<EOS>
I
was
silenced
.
  
<EOS>
He
still
slowly
moved
his
finger
over
his
upper
lip
,
and
still
his
eye
dwelt
dreamily
on
the
glowing
grate
;
thinking
it
urgent
to
say
something
,
I
asked
him
presently
if
he
felt
any
cold
draught
from
the
door
,
which
was
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
he
responded
shortly
and
somewhat
testily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
I
reflected
,
"
if
you
wo
n't
talk
,
you
may
be
still
;
I
'll
let
you
alone
now
,
and
return
to
my
book
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
I
snuffed
the
candle
and
resumed
the
perusal
of
"
Marmion
.
"
<EOS>
He
soon
stirred
;
my
eye
was
instantly
drawn
to
his
movements
;
he
only
took
out
a
morocco
pocket
-
book
,
thence
produced
a
letter
,
which
he
read
in
silence
,
folded
it
,
put
it
back
,
relapsed
into
meditation
.
<EOS>
It
was
vain
to
try
to
read
with
such
an
inscrutable
fixture
before
me
;
nor
could
I
,
in
impatience
,
consent
to
be
dumb
;
he
might
rebuff
me
if
he
liked
,
but
talk
I
would
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
heard
from
Diana
and
Mary
lately
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
since
the
letter
I
showed
you
a
week
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
has
not
been
any
change
made
about
your
own
arrangements
?
<EOS>
You
will
not
be
summoned
to
leave
England
sooner
than
you
expected
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
not
,
indeed
:
such
chance
is
too
good
to
befall
me
.
"
<EOS>
Baffled
so
far
,
I
changed
my
ground
.
<EOS>
I
bethought
myself
to
talk
about
the
school
and
my
scholars
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
Garrett
's
mother
is
better
,
and
Mary
came
back
to
the
school
this
morning
,
and
I
shall
have
four
new
girls
next
week
from
the
Foundry
Close
 
they
would
have
come
to
-
day
but
for
the
snow
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Indeed
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Oliver
pays
for
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
means
to
give
the
whole
school
a
treat
at
Christmas
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
your
suggestion
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whose
,
then
?
"
  
"
His
daughter
's
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
like
her
:
<EOS>
she
is
so
good
-
natured
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
came
the
blank
of
a
pause
:
the
clock
struck
eight
strokes
.
<EOS>
It
aroused
him
;
he
uncrossed
his
legs
,
sat
erect
,
turned
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
your
book
a
moment
,
and
come
a
little
nearer
the
fire
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
Wondering
,
and
of
my
wonder
finding
no
end
<EOS>
,
I
complied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Half
-
an
-
hour
ago
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
I
spoke
of
my
impatience
to
hear
the
sequel
of
a
tale
:
<EOS>
on
reflection
,
I
find
the
matter
will
be
better
managed
by
my
assuming
the
narrator
's
part
,
and
converting
you
into
a
listener
.
<EOS>
Before
commencing
,
it
is
but
fair
to
warn
you
that
the
story
will
sound
somewhat
hackneyed
in
your
ears
;
but
stale
details
often
regain
a
degree
of
freshness
when
they
pass
through
new
lips
.
<EOS>
For
the
rest
,
whether
trite
or
novel
,
it
is
short
.
  
<EOS>
"
Twenty
years
ago
,
a
poor
curate
 
never
mind
his
name
at
this
moment
 
fell
in
love
with
a
rich
man
's
daughter
;
she
fell
in
love
with
him
,
and
married
him
,
against
the
advice
of
all
her
friends
,
who
consequently
disowned
her
immediately
after
the
wedding
.
<EOS>
Before
two
years
passed
,
the
rash
pair
were
both
dead
,
and
laid
quietly
side
by
side
under
one
slab
.
<EOS>
(
I
have
seen
their
grave
;
it
formed
part
of
the
pavement
of
a
huge
churchyard
surrounding
the
grim
,
soot
-
black
old
cathedral
of
an
overgrown
manufacturing
town
in
shire
.
)
<EOS>
They
left
a
daughter
,
which
,
at
its
very
birth
,
Charity
received
in
her
lap
 
cold
as
that
of
the
snow
-
drift
<EOS>
I
almost
stuck
fast
in
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Charity
carried
the
friendless
thing
to
the
house
of
its
rich
maternal
relations
;
it
was
reared
by
an
aunt
-
in-
law
,
called
(
I
come
to
names
now
)
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
of
Gateshead
.
<EOS>
You
start
 
<EOS>
did
you
hear
a
noise
?
<EOS>
I
daresay
it
is
only
a
rat
scrambling
along
the
rafters
of
the
adjoining
schoolroom
<EOS>
:
it
was
a
barn
before
I
had
it
repaired
and
altered
,
and
barns
are
generally
haunted
by
rats
.
 
<EOS>
To
proceed
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
kept
the
orphan
ten
years
:
whether
it
was
happy
or
not
with
her
,
I
can
not
say
,
never
having
been
told
;
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
transferred
it
to
a
place
<EOS>
you
know
 
being
no
other
than
Lowood
School
,
where
you
so
long
resided
yourself
.
<EOS>
It
seems
her
career
there
was
very
honourable
:
from
a
pupil
,
she
became
a
teacher
,
like
yourself
 
really
it
strikes
me
there
are
parallel
points
in
her
history
and
yours
 
<EOS>
she
left
it
to
be
a
governess
:
there
,
again
,
your
fates
were
analogous
;
she
undertook
the
education
of
the
ward
of
a
certain
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Rivers
!
<EOS>
"
I
interrupted
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
guess
your
feelings
,
"
he
said
,
"
but
restrain
them
for
a
while
:
I
have
nearly
finished
;
hear
me
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
Of
Mr.
Rochester
's
character
I
know
nothing
,
but
the
one
fact
that
he
professed
to
offer
honourable
marriage
to
this
young
girl
,
and
that
at
the
very
altar
she
discovered
he
had
a
wife
yet
alive
,
though
a
lunatic
.
<EOS>
What
his
subsequent
conduct
and
proposals
were
is
a
matter
of
pure
conjecture
;
but
when
an
event
transpired
which
rendered
inquiry
after
the
governess
necessary
,
it
was
discovered
she
was
gone
 
<EOS>
no
one
could
tell
when
,
where
,
or
how
.
<EOS>
She
had
left
Thornfield
Hall
in
the
night
;
every
research
after
her
course
had
been
vain
:
the
country
had
been
scoured
far
and
wide
;
no
vestige
of
information
could
be
gathered
respecting
her
.
<EOS>
Yet
that
she
should
be
found
is
become
a
matter
of
serious
urgency
:
<EOS>
advertisements
have
been
put
in
all
the
papers
;
I
myself
have
received
a
letter
from
one
Mr.
Briggs
,
a
solicitor
,
communicating
the
details
I
have
just
imparted
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
an
odd
tale
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
tell
me
this
,
"
said
I
,
"
and
since
you
know
so
much
,
you
surely
can
tell
it
me
 
<EOS>
what
of
Mr.
Rochester
?
<EOS>
How
and
where
is
he
?
<EOS>
What
is
he
doing
?
<EOS>
Is
he
well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
ignorant
of
all
concerning
Mr.
Rochester
:
the
letter
never
mentions
him
but
to
narrate
the
fraudulent
and
illegal
attempt
I
have
adverted
to
.
<EOS>
You
should
rather
ask
the
name
of
the
governess
 
<EOS>
the
nature
of
the
event
which
requires
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Did
no
one
go
to
Thornfield
Hall
,
then
?
<EOS>
Did
no
one
see
Mr.
Rochester
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
they
wrote
to
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
.
"
  
"
And
what
did
he
say
?
<EOS>
Who
has
his
letters
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Briggs
intimates
that
the
answer
to
his
application
was
not
from
Mr.
Rochester
,
but
from
a
lady
:
it
is
signed
"
Alice
Fairfax
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
I
felt
cold
and
dismayed
:
my
worst
fears
then
were
probably
true
:
he
had
in
all
probability
left
England
and
rushed
in
reckless
desperation
to
some
former
haunt
on
the
Continent
.
<EOS>
And
what
opiate
for
his
severe
sufferings
 
<EOS>
what
object
for
his
strong
passions
 
had
he
sought
there
?
<EOS>
I
dared
not
answer
the
question
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
poor
master
 
once
almost
my
husband
 
whom
I
had
often
called
"
my
dear
Edward
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
must
have
been
a
bad
man
,
"
observed
Mr.
Rivers
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
him
 
do
n't
pronounce
an
opinion
upon
him
,
"
I
said
,
with
warmth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
he
answered
quietly
:
"
and
indeed
my
head
is
otherwise
occupied
than
with
him
:
<EOS>
I
have
my
tale
to
finish
.
<EOS>
Since
you
wo
n't
ask
the
governess
's
name
,
I
must
tell
it
of
my
own
accord
.
<EOS>
Stay
!
<EOS>
I
have
it
here
 
<EOS>
it
is
always
more
satisfactory
to
see
important
points
written
down
,
fairly
committed
to
black
and
white
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
the
pocket
-
book
was
again
deliberately
produced
,
opened
,
sought
through
;
from
one
of
its
compartments
was
extracted
a
shabby
slip
of
paper
,
hastily
torn
off
:
I
recognised
in
its
texture
and
its
stains
of
ultra
-
marine
,
and
lake
,
and
vermillion
,
the
ravished
margin
of
the
portrait
-
cover
.
<EOS>
He
got
up
,
held
it
close
to
my
eyes
:
and
I
read
,
traced
in
Indian
ink
,
in
my
own
handwriting
,
the
words
"
JANE
EYRE
"
 
<EOS>
the
work
doubtless
of
some
moment
of
abstraction
.
  
<EOS>
"
Briggs
wrote
to
me
of
a
Jane
Eyre
:
"
he
said
,
"
the
advertisements
demanded
a
Jane
Eyre
:
I
knew
a
Jane
Elliott
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
<EOS>
I
had
my
suspicions
,
but
it
was
only
yesterday
afternoon
they
were
at
once
resolved
into
certainty
.
<EOS>
You
own
the
name
and
renounce
the
_
alias
_
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
 
yes
;
but
where
is
Mr.
Briggs
?
<EOS>
He
perhaps
knows
more
of
Mr.
Rochester
than
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Briggs
is
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
should
doubt
his
knowing
anything
at
all
about
Mr.
Rochester
;
it
is
not
in
Mr.
Rochester
he
is
interested
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
you
forget
essential
points
in
pursuing
trifles
:
you
do
not
inquire
why
Mr.
Briggs
sought
after
you
 
what
he
wanted
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
what
did
he
want
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Merely
to
tell
you
that
your
uncle
,
Mr.
Eyre
of
Madeira
,
is
dead
;
that
he
has
left
you
all
his
property
,
and
that
you
are
now
rich
 
merely
that
 
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
I
!
 
rich
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
,
rich
 
quite
an
heiress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Silence
succeeded
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
prove
your
identity
of
course
,
"
resumed
St.
John
presently
:
"
a
step
which
will
offer
no
difficulties
;
you
can
then
enter
on
immediate
possession
.
<EOS>
Your
fortune
is
vested
in
the
English
funds
;
Briggs
has
the
will
and
the
necessary
documents
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
was
a
new
card
turned
up
!
<EOS>
It
is
a
fine
thing
,
reader
,
to
be
lifted
in
a
moment
from
indigence
to
wealth
 
a
very
fine
thing
;
but
not
a
matter
one
can
comprehend
,
or
consequently
enjoy
,
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
And
then
there
are
other
chances
in
life
far
more
thrilling
and
rapture
-
giving
:
_
<EOS>
this
_
is
solid
,
an
affair
of
the
actual
world
,
nothing
ideal
about
it
:
all
its
associations
are
solid
and
sober
,
and
its
manifestations
are
the
same
.
<EOS>
One
does
not
jump
,
and
spring
,
and
shout
hurrah
!
<EOS>
at
hearing
one
has
got
a
fortune
;
one
begins
to
consider
responsibilities
,
and
to
ponder
business
;
on
a
base
of
steady
satisfaction
rise
certain
grave
cares
,
and
we
contain
ourselves
,
and
brood
over
our
bliss
with
a
solemn
brow
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
words
Legacy
,
Bequest
,
go
side
by
side
with
the
words
,
Death
,
Funeral
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
I
had
heard
was
dead
 
my
only
relative
;
ever
since
being
made
aware
of
his
existence
,
I
had
cherished
the
hope
of
one
day
seeing
him
:
now
,
I
never
should
.
<EOS>
And
then
this
money
came
only
to
me
:
not
to
me
and
a
rejoicing
family
,
but
to
my
isolated
self
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
grand
boon
doubtless
;
and
independence
would
be
glorious
 
<EOS>
yes
,
I
felt
that
 
that
thought
swelled
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
unbend
your
forehead
at
last
,
"
said
Mr.
Rivers
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
Medusa
had
looked
at
you
,
and
that
you
were
turning
to
stone
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
now
you
will
ask
how
much
you
are
worth
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
much
am
I
worth
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
a
trifle
!
<EOS>
Nothing
of
course
to
speak
of
 
twenty
thousand
pounds
,
I
think
they
say
 
<EOS>
but
what
is
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Twenty
thousand
pounds
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
was
a
new
stunner
 
I
had
been
calculating
on
four
or
five
thousand
.
<EOS>
This
news
actually
took
my
breath
for
a
moment
:
<EOS>
Mr.
St.
John
,
whom
I
had
never
heard
laugh
before
,
laughed
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
he
,
"
if
you
had
committed
a
murder
,
and
I
had
told
you
your
crime
was
discovered
,
you
could
scarcely
look
more
aghast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
large
sum
 
<EOS>
do
n't
you
think
there
is
a
mistake
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
mistake
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
have
read
the
figures
wrong
 
<EOS>
it
may
be
two
thousand
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
written
in
letters
,
not
figures
,
 
twenty
thousand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
again
felt
rather
like
an
individual
of
but
average
gastronomical
powers
sitting
down
to
feast
alone
at
a
table
spread
with
provisions
for
a
hundred
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rivers
rose
now
and
put
his
cloak
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
were
not
such
a
very
wild
night
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
would
send
Hannah
down
to
keep
you
company
:
you
look
too
desperately
miserable
to
be
left
alone
.
<EOS>
But
Hannah
,
poor
woman
!
<EOS>
could
not
stride
the
drifts
so
well
as
I
:
<EOS>
her
legs
are
not
quite
so
long
:
so
<EOS>
I
must
e'en
leave
you
to
your
sorrows
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
lifting
the
latch
:
a
sudden
thought
occurred
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
Stop
one
minute
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
puzzles
me
to
know
why
Mr.
Briggs
wrote
to
you
about
me
;
or
how
he
knew
you
,
or
could
fancy
that
you
,
living
in
such
an
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
place
,
had
the
power
to
aid
in
my
discovery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
am
a
clergyman
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
the
clergy
are
often
appealed
to
about
odd
matters
.
"
<EOS>
Again
the
latch
rattled
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
that
does
not
satisfy
me
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
:
and
indeed
there
was
something
in
the
hasty
and
unexplanatory
reply
which
,
instead
of
allaying
,
piqued
my
curiosity
more
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
very
strange
piece
of
business
,
"
I
added
;
"
I
must
know
more
about
it
.
"
  
"
Another
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
to
-
night
!
 
to
-
night
!
"
<EOS>
and
as
he
turned
from
the
door
,
I
placed
myself
between
it
and
him
.
<EOS>
He
looked
rather
embarrassed
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
certainly
shall
not
go
till
you
have
told
me
all
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not
just
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
!
 
<EOS>
you
must
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
Diana
or
Mary
informed
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Of
course
these
objections
wrought
my
eagerness
to
a
climax
:
gratified
it
must
be
,
and
that
without
delay
;
and
I
told
him
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
apprised
you
that
I
was
a
hard
man
,
"
said
he
,
"
difficult
to
persuade
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
a
hard
woman
,
 
impossible
to
put
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
{
And
I
am
a
hard
woman
,
 
impossible
to
put
off
:
p369.jpg
}
  
"
<EOS>
And
then
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
I
am
cold
:
<EOS>
no
fervour
infects
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whereas
I
am
hot
,
and
fire
dissolves
ice
.
<EOS>
The
blaze
there
has
thawed
all
the
snow
from
your
cloak
;
by
the
same
token
,
it
has
streamed
on
to
my
floor
,
and
made
it
like
a
trampled
street
.
<EOS>
As
you
hope
ever
to
be
forgiven
,
Mr.
Rivers
,
the
high
crime
and
misdemeanour
of
spoiling
a
sanded
kitchen
,
tell
me
what
I
wish
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
yield
;
if
not
to
your
earnestness
,
to
your
perseverance
:
as
stone
is
worn
by
continual
dropping
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
you
must
know
some
day
,
 
as
well
now
as
later
.
<EOS>
Your
name
is
Jane
Eyre
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
:
that
was
all
settled
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
,
perhaps
,
aware
that
I
am
your
namesake
?
 
<EOS>
that
I
was
christened
St.
John
Eyre
Rivers
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
remember
now
seeing
the
letter
E.
comprised
in
your
initials
written
in
books
you
have
at
different
times
lent
me
;
but
I
never
asked
for
what
name
it
stood
.
<EOS>
But
what
then
?
<EOS>
Surely
 
"
  
I
stopped
:
I
could
not
trust
myself
to
entertain
,
much
less
to
express
,
the
thought
that
rushed
upon
me
 
that
embodied
itself
,
 
that
,
in
a
second
,
stood
out
a
strong
,
solid
probability
.
<EOS>
Circumstances
knit
themselves
,
fitted
themselves
,
shot
into
order
:
<EOS>
the
chain
that
had
been
lying
hitherto
a
formless
lump
of
links
was
drawn
out
straight
,
 
every
ring
was
perfect
,
the
connection
complete
.
<EOS>
I
knew
,
by
instinct
,
how
the
matter
stood
,
before
St.
John
had
said
another
word
;
but
I
can
not
expect
the
reader
to
have
the
same
intuitive
perception
,
so
I
must
repeat
his
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
's
name
was
Eyre
;
she
had
two
brothers
;
one
a
clergyman
,
who
married
Miss
Jane
Reed
,
of
Gateshead
;
the
other
,
John
Eyre
,
Esq
.
,
merchant
,
late
of
Funchal
,
Madeira
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Briggs
,
being
Mr.
Eyre
's
solicitor
,
wrote
to
us
last
August
to
inform
us
of
our
uncle
's
death
,
and
to
say
that
he
had
left
his
property
to
his
brother
the
clergyman
's
orphan
daughter
,
overlooking
us
,
in
consequence
of
a
quarrel
,
never
forgiven
,
between
him
and
my
father
.
<EOS>
He
wrote
again
a
few
weeks
since
,
to
intimate
that
the
heiress
was
lost
,
and
asking
if
we
knew
anything
of
her
.
<EOS>
A
name
casually
written
on
a
slip
of
paper
has
enabled
me
to
find
her
out
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Again
he
was
going
,
but
I
set
my
back
against
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
let
me
speak
,
"
I
said
;
"
let
me
have
one
moment
to
draw
breath
and
reflect
.
<EOS>
"
I
paused
 
he
stood
before
me
,
hat
in
hand
,
looking
composed
enough
.
<EOS>
I
resumed
    
"
<EOS>
Your
mother
was
my
father
's
sister
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
aunt
,
consequently
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
bowed
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
John
was
your
uncle
John
?
<EOS>
You
,
Diana
,
and
Mary
are
his
sister
's
children
,
as
I
am
his
brother
's
child
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Undeniably
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
three
,
then
,
are
my
cousins
;
half
our
blood
on
each
side
flows
from
the
same
source
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
cousins
;
yes
.
"
  
I
surveyed
him
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
I
had
found
a
brother
:
one
I
could
be
proud
of
,
 
one
I
could
love
;
and
two
sisters
,
whose
qualities
were
such
,
that
,
when
I
knew
them
but
as
mere
strangers
,
they
had
inspired
me
with
genuine
affection
and
admiration
.
<EOS>
The
two
girls
,
on
whom
,
kneeling
down
on
the
wet
ground
,
and
looking
through
the
low
,
latticed
window
of
Moor
House
kitchen
,
I
had
gazed
with
so
bitter
a
mixture
of
interest
and
despair
,
were
my
near
kinswomen
;
and
the
young
and
stately
gentleman
who
had
found
me
almost
dying
at
his
threshold
was
my
blood
relation
.
<EOS>
Glorious
discovery
to
a
lonely
wretch
!
<EOS>
This
was
wealth
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
wealth
to
the
heart
!
 
<EOS>
a
mine
of
pure
,
genial
affections
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
blessing
,
bright
,
vivid
,
and
exhilarating
;
 
not
like
the
ponderous
gift
of
gold
:
rich
and
welcome
enough
in
its
way
,
but
sobering
from
its
weight
.
<EOS>
I
now
clapped
my
hands
in
sudden
joy
 
<EOS>
my
pulse
bounded
,
my
veins
thrilled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
am
glad
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
.
  
<EOS>
St.
John
smiled
.
<EOS>
"
Did
I
not
say
you
neglected
essential
points
to
pursue
trifles
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
serious
when
I
told
you
you
had
got
a
fortune
;
and
now
,
for
a
matter
of
no
moment
,
you
are
excited
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
you
mean
?
<EOS>
It
may
be
of
no
moment
to
you
;
you
have
sisters
and
do
n't
care
for
a
cousin
;
but
I
had
nobody
;
and
now
three
relations
,
 
or
two
,
if
you
do
n't
choose
to
be
counted
,
 
are
born
into
my
world
full
-
grown
.
<EOS>
I
say
again
,
I
am
glad
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
walked
fast
through
the
room
:
I
stopped
,
half
suffocated
with
the
thoughts
that
rose
faster
than
I
could
receive
,
comprehend
,
settle
them
:
 
thoughts
of
what
might
,
could
,
would
,
and
should
be
,
and
that
ere
long
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
the
blank
wall
:
it
seemed
a
sky
thick
with
ascending
stars
,
 
every
one
lit
me
to
a
purpose
or
delight
.
<EOS>
Those
who
had
saved
my
life
,
whom
,
till
this
hour
,
I
had
loved
barrenly
,
I
could
now
benefit
.
<EOS>
They
were
under
a
yoke
,
 
<EOS>
I
could
free
them
:
<EOS>
they
were
scattered
,
 
<EOS>
I
could
reunite
them
:
the
independence
,
the
affluence
which
was
mine
,
might
be
theirs
too
.
<EOS>
Were
we
not
four
?
<EOS>
Twenty
thousand
pounds
shared
equally
would
be
five
thousand
each
,
justice
 
enough
and
to
spare
:
justice
would
be
done
,
 
mutual
happiness
secured
.
<EOS>
Now
the
wealth
did
not
weigh
on
me
:
now
it
was
not
a
mere
bequest
of
coin
,
 
<EOS>
it
was
a
legacy
of
life
,
hope
,
enjoyment
.
  
<EOS>
How
I
looked
while
these
ideas
were
taking
my
spirit
by
storm
,
I
can
not
tell
;
but
I
perceived
soon
that
Mr.
Rivers
had
placed
a
chair
behind
me
,
and
was
gently
attempting
to
make
me
sit
down
on
it
.
<EOS>
He
also
advised
me
to
be
composed
;
I
scorned
the
insinuation
of
helplessness
and
distraction
,
shook
off
his
hand
,
and
began
to
walk
about
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Write
to
Diana
and
Mary
to
-
morrow
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
tell
them
to
come
home
directly
.
<EOS>
Diana
said
they
would
both
consider
themselves
rich
with
a
thousand
pounds
,
so
with
five
thousand
they
will
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
where
I
can
get
you
a
glass
of
water
,
"
said
St.
John
;
"
you
must
really
make
an
effort
to
tranquillise
your
feelings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
and
what
sort
of
an
effect
will
the
bequest
have
on
you
?
<EOS>
Will
it
keep
you
in
England
,
induce
you
to
marry
Miss
Oliver
,
and
settle
down
like
an
ordinary
mortal
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wander
:
your
head
becomes
confused
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
too
abrupt
in
communicating
the
news
;
it
has
excited
you
beyond
your
strength
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Rivers
!
<EOS>
you
quite
put
me
out
of
patience
:
I
am
rational
enough
;
it
is
you
who
misunderstand
,
or
rather
who
affect
to
misunderstand
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
if
you
explained
yourself
a
little
more
fully
,
I
should
comprehend
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Explain
!
<EOS>
What
is
there
to
explain
?
<EOS>
You
can
not
fail
to
see
that
twenty
thousand
pounds
,
the
sum
in
question
,
divided
equally
between
the
nephew
and
three
nieces
of
our
uncle
,
<EOS>
will
give
five
thousand
to
each
?
<EOS>
What
I
want
is
,
that
you
should
write
to
your
sisters
and
tell
them
of
the
fortune
that
has
accrued
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
you
,
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
intimated
my
view
of
the
case
:
I
am
incapable
of
taking
any
other
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
brutally
selfish
,
blindly
unjust
,
or
fiendishly
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
am
resolved
I
will
have
a
home
and
connections
.
<EOS>
I
like
Moor
House
,
and
I
will
live
at
Moor
House
;
I
like
Diana
and
Mary
,
and
I
will
attach
myself
for
life
to
Diana
and
Mary
.
<EOS>
It
would
please
and
benefit
me
to
have
five
thousand
pounds
;
it
would
torment
and
oppress
me
to
have
twenty
thousand
;
which
,
moreover
,
could
never
be
mine
in
justice
,
though
it
might
in
law
.
<EOS>
I
abandon
to
you
,
then
,
what
is
absolutely
superfluous
to
me
.
<EOS>
Let
there
be
no
opposition
,
and
no
discussion
about
it
;
let
us
agree
amongst
each
other
,
and
decide
the
point
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
acting
on
first
impulses
;
you
must
take
days
to
consider
such
a
matter
,
ere
your
word
can
be
regarded
as
valid
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
all
you
doubt
is
my
sincerity
,
I
am
easy
:
you
see
the
justice
of
the
case
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
_
do
_
see
a
certain
justice
;
but
it
is
contrary
to
all
custom
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
entire
fortune
is
your
right
<EOS>
:
my
uncle
gained
it
by
his
own
efforts
;
he
was
free
to
leave
it
<EOS>
to
whom
he
would
<EOS>
:
he
left
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
justice
permits
you
to
keep
it
:
you
may
,
with
a
clear
conscience
,
consider
it
absolutely
your
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
me
,
"
said
I
,
"
it
is
fully
as
much
a
matter
of
feeling
as
of
conscience
:
<EOS>
I
must
indulge
my
feelings
;
I
so
seldom
have
had
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
.
<EOS>
Were
you
to
argue
,
object
,
and
annoy
me
for
a
year
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
forego
the
delicious
pleasure
of
which
I
have
caught
a
glimpse
 
that
of
repaying
,
in
part
,
a
mighty
obligation
,
and
winning
to
myself
lifelong
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
so
now
,
"
rejoined
St.
John
,
"
because
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
possess
,
nor
consequently
to
enjoy
wealth
<EOS>
:
you
can
not
form
a
notion
of
the
importance
twenty
thousand
pounds
would
give
you
;
of
the
place
it
would
enable
you
to
take
in
society
;
of
the
prospects
it
would
open
to
you
:
you
can
not
 
"
  
"
And
you
,
"
I
interrupted
,
"
can
not
at
all
imagine
the
craving
I
have
for
fraternal
and
sisterly
love
.
<EOS>
I
never
had
a
home
,
I
never
had
brothers
or
sisters
;
I
must
and
will
have
them
now
:
you
are
not
reluctant
to
admit
me
and
own
me
,
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
I
will
be
your
brother
 
my
sisters
will
be
your
sisters
 
without
stipulating
for
this
sacrifice
of
your
just
rights
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Brother
?
<EOS>
Yes
;
at
the
distance
of
a
thousand
leagues
!
<EOS>
Sisters
?
<EOS>
Yes
;
slaving
amongst
strangers
!
<EOS>
I
,
wealthy
 
gorged
with
gold
I
never
earned
and
do
not
merit
!
<EOS>
You
,
penniless
!
<EOS>
Famous
equality
and
fraternisation
!
<EOS>
Close
union
!
<EOS>
Intimate
attachment
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Jane
,
your
aspirations
after
family
ties
and
domestic
happiness
may
be
realised
otherwise
than
by
the
means
you
contemplate
:
you
may
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nonsense
,
again
!
<EOS>
Marry
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
marry
,
and
never
shall
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
saying
too
much
:
such
hazardous
affirmations
are
a
proof
of
the
excitement
under
which
you
labour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
saying
too
much
:
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
feel
,
and
how
averse
are
my
inclinations
to
the
bare
thought
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
No
one
would
take
me
for
love
;
and
I
will
not
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
mere
money
speculation
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
not
want
a
stranger
 
unsympathising
,
alien
,
different
from
me
;
I
want
my
kindred
:
those
with
whom
I
have
full
fellow-
feeling
.
<EOS>
Say
again
you
will
be
my
brother
:
when
you
uttered
the
words
I
was
satisfied
,
happy
;
repeat
them
,
if
you
can
,
repeat
them
sincerely
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
can
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
have
always
loved
my
own
sisters
;
and
I
know
on
what
my
affection
for
them
is
grounded
,
 
respect
for
their
worth
and
admiration
of
their
talents
.
<EOS>
You
too
have
principle
and
mind
:
<EOS>
your
tastes
and
habits
resemble
Diana
's
and
Mary
's
;
your
presence
is
always
agreeable
to
me
;
in
your
conversation
I
have
already
for
some
time
found
a
salutary
solace
.
<EOS>
I
feel
I
can
easily
and
naturally
make
room
in
my
heart
for
you
,
as
my
third
and
youngest
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
:
that
contents
me
for
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Now
you
had
better
go
;
for
if
you
stay
longer
,
you
will
perhaps
irritate
me
afresh
by
some
mistrustful
scruple
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
the
school
,
Miss
Eyre
?
<EOS>
It
must
now
be
shut
up
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
will
retain
my
post
of
mistress
till
you
get
a
substitute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
smiled
approbation
:
we
shook
hands
,
and
he
took
leave
.
  
<EOS>
I
need
not
narrate
in
detail
the
further
struggles
I
had
,
and
arguments
I
used
,
to
get
matters
regarding
the
legacy
settled
as
I
wished
.
<EOS>
My
task
was
a
very
hard
one
;
but
,
as
I
was
absolutely
resolved
 
as
my
cousins
saw
at
length
that
my
mind
was
really
and
immutably
fixed
on
making
a
just
division
of
the
property
 
as
they
must
in
their
own
hearts
have
felt
the
equity
of
the
intention
;
and
must
,
besides
,
have
been
innately
conscious
that
in
my
place
they
would
have
done
precisely
what
I
wished
to
do
 
they
yielded
at
length
so
far
as
to
consent
to
put
the
affair
to
arbitration
.
<EOS>
The
judges
chosen
were
Mr.
Oliver
and
an
able
lawyer
:
both
coincided
in
my
opinion
:
I
carried
my
point
.
<EOS>
The
instruments
of
transfer
were
drawn
out
:
<EOS>
St.
John
,
Diana
,
Mary
,
and
I
,
each
became
possessed
of
a
competency
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
near
Christmas
by
the
time
all
was
settled
:
the
season
of
general
holiday
approached
.
<EOS>
I
now
closed
Morton
school
,
taking
care
that
the
parting
should
not
be
barren
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
Good
fortune
opens
the
hand
as
well
as
the
heart
wonderfully
;
and
to
give
somewhat
when
we
have
largely
received
,
is
but
to
afford
a
vent
to
the
unusual
ebullition
of
the
sensations
.
<EOS>
I
had
long
felt
with
pleasure
that
many
of
my
rustic
scholars
liked
me
,
and
when
we
parted
,
that
consciousness
was
confirmed
:
they
manifested
their
affection
plainly
and
strongly
.
<EOS>
Deep
was
my
gratification
to
find
I
had
really
a
place
in
their
unsophisticated
hearts
:
I
promised
them
that
never
a
week
should
pass
in
future
that
I
did
not
visit
them
,
and
give
them
an
hour
's
teaching
in
their
school
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rivers
came
up
as
,
having
seen
the
classes
,
now
numbering
sixty
girls
,
file
out
before
me
,
and
locked
the
door
,
I
stood
with
the
key
in
my
hand
,
exchanging
a
few
words
of
special
farewell
with
some
half
-
dozen
of
my
best
scholars
:
as
decent
,
respectable
,
modest
,
and
well
-
informed
young
women
as
could
be
found
in
the
ranks
of
the
British
peasantry
.
<EOS>
And
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
;
for
after
all
,
the
British
peasantry
are
the
best
taught
,
best
mannered
,
most
self
-
respecting
of
any
in
Europe
:
since
those
days
I
have
seen
paysannes
and
Bauerinnen
;
and
the
best
of
them
seemed
to
me
ignorant
,
coarse
,
and
besotted
,
compared
with
my
Morton
girls
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
consider
you
have
got
your
reward
for
a
season
of
exertion
?
"
asked
Mr.
Rivers
,
when
they
were
gone
.
"
<EOS>
Does
not
the
consciousness
of
having
done
some
real
good
in
your
day
and
generation
give
pleasure
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Doubtless
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
only
toiled
a
few
months
!
<EOS>
Would
not
a
life
devoted
to
the
task
of
regenerating
your
race
be
well
spent
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
;
"
but
I
could
not
go
on
for
ever
so
<EOS>
:
I
want
to
enjoy
my
own
faculties
as
well
as
to
cultivate
those
of
other
people
.
<EOS>
I
must
enjoy
them
now
;
do
n't
recall
either
my
mind
or
body
to
the
school
;
I
am
out
of
it
and
disposed
for
full
holiday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
grave
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
now
?
<EOS>
What
sudden
eagerness
is
this
you
evince
?
<EOS>
What
are
you
going
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
active
:
as
active
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
And
first
I
must
beg
you
to
set
Hannah
at
liberty
,
and
get
somebody
else
to
wait
on
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
want
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
to
go
with
me
to
Moor
House
.
<EOS>
Diana
and
Mary
will
be
at
home
in
a
week
,
and
I
want
to
have
everything
in
order
against
their
arrival
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
were
for
flying
off
on
some
excursion
.
<EOS>
It
is
better
so
:
Hannah
shall
go
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
her
to
be
ready
by
to
-
morrow
then
;
and
here
is
the
schoolroom
key
:
I
will
give
you
the
key
of
my
cottage
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
it
.
<EOS>
"
You
give
it
up
very
gleefully
,
"
said
he
;
"
I
do
n't
quite
understand
your
light
-
heartedness

because
I
can
not
tell
what
employment
you
propose

yourself
as
a
substitute
for
the
one
you
are
relinquishing

<EOS>
What
aim

what
purpose

what
ambition
in

have
you
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
first
aim
will
be
to
_
clean
down
_
<EOS>
(
do
you
comprehend
the
full
force
of
the
expression
?
)
 
<EOS>
to
_
<EOS>
clean
down
_
Moor
House
from
chamber
to
cellar
;
my
next
to
rub
it
up
with
bees
-
wax
,
oil
,
and
an
indefinite
number
of
cloths
,
till
it
glitters
again
;
my
third
,
to
arrange
every
chair
,
table
,
bed
,
carpet
,
with
mathematical
precision
;
afterwards
I
shall
go
near
to
ruin
you
in
coals
and
peat
to
keep
up
good
fires
in
every
room
;
and
lastly
,
the
two
days
preceding
that
on
which
your
sisters
are
expected
will
be
devoted
by
Hannah
and
me
to
such
a
beating
of
eggs
,
sorting
of
currants
,
grating
of
spices
,
compounding
of
Christmas
cakes
,
chopping
up
of
materials
for
mince
-
pies
,
and
solemnising
of
other
culinary
rites
,
as
words
can
convey
but
an
inadequate
notion
of
to
the
uninitiated
like
you
.
<EOS>
My
purpose
,
in
short
,
is
to
have
all
things
in
an
absolutely
perfect
state
of
readiness
for
Diana
and
Mary
before
next
Thursday
;
and
my
ambition
is
to
give
them
a
beau
-
ideal
of
a
welcome
when
they
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
St.
John
smiled
slightly
:
still
he
was
dissatisfied
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
very
well
for
the
present
,
"
said
he
;
"
but
seriously
,
I
trust
that
when
the
first
flush
of
vivacity
is
over
,
you
will
look
a
little
higher
than
domestic
endearments
and
household
joys
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
best
things
the
world
has
!
"
I
interrupted
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Jane
,
no
:
this
world
is
not
the
scene
of
fruition
;
do
not
attempt
to
make
it
so
:
nor
of
rest
;
do
not
turn
slothful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
on
the
contrary
,
to
be
busy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
I
excuse
you
for
the
present
:
two
months
'
grace
<EOS>
I
allow
you
for
the
full
enjoyment
of
your
new
position
,
and
for
pleasing
yourself
with
this
late
-
found
charm
of
relationship
;
<EOS>
but
_
<EOS>
then
_
,
I
hope
you
will
begin
to
look
beyond
Moor
House
and
Morton
,
and
sisterly
society
,
and
the
selfish
calm
and
sensual
comfort
of
civilised
affluence
.
<EOS>
I
hope
your
energies
will
then
once
more
trouble
you
with
their
strength
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
looked
at
him
with
surprise
.
"
<EOS>
St.
John
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
think
you
are
almost
wicked
to
talk
so
.
<EOS>
I
am
disposed
to
be
as
content
as
a
queen
,
and
you
try
to
stir
me
up
to
restlessness
!
<EOS>
To
what
end
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
the
end
of
turning
to
profit
the
talents
which
God
has
committed
to
your
keeping
;
and
of
which
He
will
surely
one
day
demand
a
strict
account
.
<EOS>
Jane
,
I
shall
watch
you
closely
and
anxiously
 
I
warn
you
of
that
.
<EOS>
And
try
to
restrain
the
disproportionate
fervour
with
which
you
throw
yourself
into
commonplace
home
pleasures
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
cling
so
tenaciously
to
ties
of
the
flesh
;
save
your
constancy
and
ardour
for
an
adequate
cause
;
forbear
to
waste
them
on
trite
transient
objects
.
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
just
as
if
you
were
speaking
Greek
.
<EOS>
I
feel
I
have
adequate
cause
to
be
happy
,
and
I
_
will
_
be
happy
.
<EOS>
Goodbye
!
"
  
<EOS>
Happy
at
Moor
House
I
was
,
and
hard
I
worked
;
and
so
did
Hannah
:
<EOS>
she
was
charmed
to
see
how
jovial
I
could
be
amidst
the
bustle
of
a
house
turned
topsy
-
turvy
 
<EOS>
how
I
could
brush
,
and
dust
,
and
clean
,
and
cook
.
<EOS>
And
really
,
after
a
day
or
two
of
confusion
worse
confounded
,
it
was
delightful
by
degrees
to
invoke
order
from
the
chaos
ourselves
had
made
.
<EOS>
I
had
previously
taken
a
journey
to
S
to
purchase
some
new
furniture
:
my
cousins
having
given
me
_
carte
blanche
_
<EOS>
to
effect
what
alterations
I
pleased
,
and
a
sum
having
been
set
aside
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
The
ordinary
sitting
-
room
and
bedrooms
<EOS>
I
left
much
as
they
were
:
for
I
knew
Diana
and
Mary
would
derive
more
pleasure
from
seeing
again
the
old
homely
tables
,
and
chairs
,
and
beds
,
than
from
the
spectacle
of
the
smartest
innovations
.
<EOS>
Still
some
novelty
was
necessary
,
to
give
to
their
return
the
piquancy
with
which
I
wished
it
to
be
invested
.
<EOS>
Dark
handsome
new
carpets
and
curtains
,
an
arrangement
of
some
carefully
selected
antique
ornaments
in
porcelain
and
bronze
,
new
coverings
,
and
mirrors
,
and
dressing
-
cases
,
for
the
toilet
tables
,
answered
the
end
:
they
looked
fresh
without
being
glaring
.
<EOS>
A
spare
parlour
and
bedroom
<EOS>
I
refurnished
entirely
,
with
old
mahogany
and
crimson
upholstery
:
I
laid
canvas
on
the
passage
,
and
carpets
on
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
When
all
was
finished
,
I
thought
Moor
House
as
complete
a
model
of
bright
modest
snugness
within
,
as
it
was
,
at
this
season
,
a
specimen
of
wintry
waste
and
desert
dreariness
without
.
  
<EOS>
The
eventful
Thursday
at
length
came
.
<EOS>
They
were
expected
about
dark
,
and
ere
dusk
fires
were
lit
upstairs
and
below
;
the
kitchen
was
in
perfect
trim
;
Hannah
and
I
were
dressed
,
and
all
was
in
readiness
.
  
<EOS>
St.
John
arrived
first
.
<EOS>
I
had
entreated
him
to
keep
quite
clear
of
the
house
till
everything
was
arranged
:
and
,
indeed
,
the
bare
idea
of
the
commotion
,
at
once
sordid
and
trivial
,
going
on
within
its
walls
sufficed
to
scare
him
to
estrangement
.
<EOS>
He
found
me
in
the
kitchen
,
watching
the
progress
of
certain
cakes
for
tea
,
then
baking
.
<EOS>
Approaching
the
hearth
,
he
asked
,
"
If
I
was
at
last
satisfied
with
housemaid
's
work
?
"
<EOS>
I
answered
by
inviting
him
to
accompany
me
on
a
general
inspection
of
the
result
of
my
labours
.
<EOS>
With
some
difficulty
,
I
got
him
to
make
the
tour
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
just
looked
in
at
the
doors
I
opened
;
and
when
he
had
wandered
upstairs
and
downstairs
,
he
said
I
must
have
gone
through
a
great
deal
of
fatigue
and
trouble
to
have
effected
such
considerable
changes
in
so
short
a
time
:
<EOS>
but
not
a
syllable
<EOS>
did
he
utter
indicating
pleasure
in
the
improved
aspect
of
his
abode
.
  
<EOS>
This
silence
damped
me
.
<EOS>
I
thought
perhaps
the
alterations
had
disturbed
some
old
associations
he
valued
.
<EOS>
I
inquired
whether
this
was
the
case
:
no
doubt
in
a
somewhat
crest
-
fallen
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
;
he
had
,
on
the
contrary
,
remarked
that
I
had
scrupulously
respected
every
association
:
he
feared
,
indeed
,
I
must
have
bestowed
more
thought
on
the
matter
than
it
was
worth
.
<EOS>
How
many
minutes
,
for
instance
,
had
I
devoted
to
studying
the
arrangement
of
this
very
room
?
 
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
bye
,
could
I
tell
him
where
such
a
book
was
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
showed
him
the
volume
on
the
shelf
:
he
took
it
down
,
and
withdrawing
to
his
accustomed
window
recess
,
he
began
to
read
it
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
I
did
not
like
this
,
reader
.
<EOS>
St.
John
was
a
good
man
;
but
I
began
to
feel
he
had
spoken
truth
of
himself
when
he
said
he
was
hard
and
cold
.
<EOS>
The
humanities
and
amenities
of
life
had
no
attraction
for
him
 
<EOS>
its
peaceful
enjoyments
no
charm
.
<EOS>
Literally
,
he
lived
only
to
aspire
 
after
what
was
good
and
great
,
certainly
;
but
still
he
would
never
rest
,
nor
approve
of
others
resting
round
him
.
<EOS>
As
I
looked
at
his
lofty
forehead
,
still
and
pale
as
a
white
stone
 
at
his
fine
lineaments
fixed
in
study
 
<EOS>
I
comprehended
all
at
once
that
he
would
hardly
make
a
good
husband
:
that
it
would
be
a
trying
thing
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
I
understood
,
as
by
inspiration
,
the
nature
of
his
love
for
Miss
Oliver
;
I
agreed
with
him
that
it
was
but
a
love
of
the
senses
.
<EOS>
I
comprehended
how
he
should
despise
himself
for
the
feverish
influence
it
exercised
over
him
;
how
he
should
wish
to
stifle
and
destroy
it
;
how
he
should
mistrust
its
ever
conducting
permanently
to
his
happiness
or
hers
.
<EOS>
I
saw
he
was
of
the
material
from
which
nature
hews
her
heroes
 
<EOS>
Christian
and
Pagan
 
<EOS>
her
lawgivers
,
her
statesmen
,
her
conquerors
:
a
steadfast
bulwark
for
great
interests
to
rest
upon
;
but
,
at
the
fireside
,
too
often
a
cold
cumbrous
column
,
gloomy
and
out
of
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
parlour
is
not
his
sphere
,
"
<EOS>
I
reflected
:
"
the
Himalayan
ridge
or
Caffre
bush
,
even
the
plague
-
cursed
Guinea
Coast
swamp
would
suit
him
better
.
<EOS>
Well
may
he
eschew
the
calm
of
domestic
life
;
it
is
not
his
element
:
there
his
faculties
stagnate
 
they
can
not
develop
or
appear
to
advantage
.
<EOS>
It
is
in
scenes
of
strife
and
danger
 
<EOS>
where
courage
is
proved
,
and
energy
exercised
,
and
fortitude
tasked
 
that
he
will
speak
and
move
,
the
leader
and
superior
.
<EOS>
A
merry
child
would
have
the
advantage
of
him
on
this
hearth
.
<EOS>
He
is
right
to
choose
a
missionary
's
career
 
I
see
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
coming
!
<EOS>
they
are
coming
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hannah
,
throwing
open
the
parlour
door
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
old
Carlo
barked
joyfully
.
<EOS>
Out
I
ran
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
dark
;
but
a
rumbling
of
wheels
was
audible
.
<EOS>
Hannah
soon
had
a
lantern
lit
.
<EOS>
The
vehicle
had
stopped
at
the
wicket
;
the
driver
opened
the
door
:
first
one
well
-
known
form
,
then
another
,
stepped
out
.
<EOS>
In
a
minute
I
had
my
face
under
their
bonnets
,
in
contact
first
with
Mary
's
soft
cheek
,
then
with
Diana
's
flowing
curls
.
<EOS>
They
laughed
 
<EOS>
kissed
me
 
then
Hannah
:
<EOS>
patted
Carlo
,
who
was
half
wild
with
delight
;
asked
eagerly
if
all
was
well
;
and
being
assured
in
the
affirmative
,
hastened
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
stiff
with
their
long
and
jolting
drive
from
Whitcross
,
and
chilled
with
the
frosty
night
air
;
but
their
pleasant
countenances
expanded
to
the
cheerful
firelight
.
<EOS>
While
the
driver
and
Hannah
brought
in
the
boxes
,
they
demanded
St.
John
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
he
advanced
from
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
They
both
threw
their
arms
round
his
neck
at
once
.
<EOS>
He
gave
each
one
quiet
kiss
,
said
in
a
low
tone
a
few
words
of
welcome
,
stood
a
while
to
be
talked
to
,
and
then
,
intimating
that
he
supposed
they
would
soon
rejoin
him
in
the
parlour
,
withdrew
there
as
to
a
place
of
refuge
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
lit
their
candles
to
go
upstairs
,
but
Diana
had
first
to
give
hospitable
orders
respecting
the
driver
;
this
done
,
both
followed
me
.
<EOS>
They
were
delighted
with
the
renovation
and
decorations
of
their
rooms
;
with
the
new
drapery
,
and
fresh
carpets
,
and
rich
tinted
china
vases
:
they
expressed
their
gratification
ungrudgingly
.
<EOS>
I
had
the
pleasure
of
feeling
that
my
arrangements
met
their
wishes
exactly
,
and
that
what
I
had
done
added
a
vivid
charm
to
their
joyous
return
home
.
  
<EOS>
Sweet
was
that
evening
.
<EOS>
My
cousins
,
full
of
exhilaration
,
were
so
eloquent
in
narrative
and
comment
,
that
their
fluency
covered
St.
John
's
taciturnity
:
he
was
sincerely
glad
to
see
his
sisters
;
but
in
their
glow
of
fervour
and
flow
of
joy
he
could
not
sympathise
.
<EOS>
The
event
of
the
day
 
that
is
,
the
return
of
Diana
and
Mary
 
pleased
him
;
but
the
accompaniments
of
that
event
,
the
glad
tumult
,
the
garrulous
glee
of
reception
irked
him
:
I
saw
he
wished
the
calmer
morrow
was
come
.
<EOS>
In
the
very
meridian
of
the
night
's
enjoyment
,
about
an
hour
after
tea
,
a
rap
was
heard
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Hannah
entered
with
the
intimation
that
"
a
poor
lad
was
come
,
at
that
unlikely
time
,
to
fetch
Mr.
Rivers
to
see
his
mother
,
who
was
drawing
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
does
she
live
,
Hannah
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Clear
up
at
Whitcross
Brow
,
almost
four
miles
off
,
and
moor
and
moss
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
I
will
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
,
sir
,
you
had
better
not
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
worst
road
to
travel
after
dark
that
can
be
:
there
's
no
track
at
all
over
the
bog
.
<EOS>
And
then
it
is
such
a
bitter
night
 
<EOS>
the
keenest
wind
you
ever
felt
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
send
word
,
sir
,
that
you
will
be
there
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
he
was
already
in
the
passage
,
putting
on
his
cloak
;
and
without
one
objection
,
one
murmur
,
he
departed
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
nine
o'clock
:
he
did
not
return
till
midnight
.
<EOS>
Starved
and
tired
enough
<EOS>
he
was
:
<EOS>
but
he
looked
happier
than
when
he
set
out
.
<EOS>
He
had
performed
an
act
of
duty
;
made
an
exertion
;
felt
his
own
strength
to
do
and
deny
,
and
was
on
better
terms
with
himself
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
the
whole
of
the
ensuing
week
tried
his
patience
.
<EOS>
It
was
Christmas
week
:
we
took
to
no
settled
employment
,
but
spent
it
in
a
sort
of
merry
domestic
dissipation
.
<EOS>
The
air
of
the
moors
,
the
freedom
of
home
,
the
dawn
of
prosperity
,
acted
on
Diana
and
Mary
's
spirits
like
some
life
-
giving
elixir
<EOS>
:
they
were
gay
from
morning
till
noon
,
and
from
noon
till
night
.
<EOS>
They
could
always
talk
;
and
their
discourse
,
witty
,
pithy
,
original
,
had
such
charms
for
me
,
that
I
preferred
listening
to
,
and
sharing
in
it
,
to
doing
anything
else
.
<EOS>
St.
John
did
not
rebuke
our
vivacity
;
but
he
escaped
from
it
:
he
was
seldom
in
the
house
;
his
parish
was
large
,
the
population
scattered
,
and
he
found
daily
business
in
visiting
the
sick
and
poor
in
its
different
districts
.
  
<EOS>
One
morning
at
breakfast
,
Diana
,
after
looking
a
little
pensive
for
some
minutes
,
asked
him
,
"
If
his
plans
were
yet
unchanged
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Unchanged
and
unchangeable
,
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
And
he
proceeded
to
inform
us
that
his
departure
from
England
was
now
definitively
fixed
for
the
ensuing
year
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
Rosamond
Oliver
?
"
suggested
Mary
,
the
words
seeming
to
escape
her
lips
involuntarily
:
for
no
sooner
had
she
uttered
them
,
than
she
made
a
gesture
as
if
wishing
to
recall
them
.
<EOS>
St.
John
had
a
book
in
his
hand
 
<EOS>
it
was
his
unsocial
custom
to
read
at
meals
 
<EOS>
he
closed
it
,
and
looked
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rosamond
Oliver
,
"
said
he
,
"
is
about
to
be
married
to
Mr.
Granby
,
one
of
the
best
connected
and
most
estimable
residents
in
S-
,
grandson
and
heir
to
Sir
Frederic
Granby
:
I
had
the
intelligence
from
her
father
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
sisters
looked
at
each
other
and
at
me
;
we
all
three
looked
at
him
:
he
was
serene
as
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
match
must
have
been
got
up
hastily
,
"
said
Diana
:
"
they
can
not
have
known
each
other
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
two
months
:
they
met
in
October
at
the
county
ball
at
S-
.
<EOS>
But
where
there
are
no
obstacles
to
a
union
,
as
in
the
present
case
,
where
the
connection
is
in
every
point
desirable
,
delays
are
unnecessary
:
they
will
be
married
as
soon
as
S
Place
,
which
Sir
Frederic
gives
up
to
them
,
can
he
refitted
for
their
reception
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
first
time
I
found
St.
John
alone
after
this
communication
,
I
felt
tempted
to
inquire
if
the
event
distressed
him
:
but
he
seemed
so
little
to
need
sympathy
,
that
,
so
far
from
venturing
to
offer
him
more
,
I
experienced
some
shame
at
the
recollection
of
what
I
had
already
hazarded
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
was
out
of
practice
in
talking
to
him
:
his
reserve
was
again
frozen
over
,
and
my
frankness
was
congealed
beneath
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
kept
his
promise
of
treating
me
like
his
sisters
;
he
continually
made
little
chilling
differences
between
us
,
which
did
not
at
all
tend
to
the
development
of
cordiality
:
in
short
,
now
that
I
was
acknowledged
his
kinswoman
,
and
lived
under
the
same
roof
with
him
,
I
felt
the
distance
between
us
to
be
far
greater
than
when
he
had
known
me
only
as
the
village
schoolmistress
.
<EOS>
When
I
remembered
how
far
I
had
once
been
admitted
to
his
confidence
,
I
could
hardly
comprehend
his
present
frigidity
.
  
<EOS>
Such
being
the
case
,
I
felt
not
a
little
surprised
when
he
raised
his
head
suddenly
from
the
desk
over
which
he
was
stooping
,
and
said
    
"
You
see
,
Jane
,
the
battle
is
fought
and
the
victory
won
.
"
  
<EOS>
Startled
at
being
thus
addressed
,
I
did
not
immediately
reply
:
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
I
answered
    
"
<EOS>
But
are
you
sure
you
are
not
in
the
position
of
those
conquerors
whose
triumphs
have
cost
them
too
dear
?
<EOS>
Would
not
such
another
ruin
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
;
and
if
I
were
,
it
does
not
much
signify
;
I
shall
never
be
called
upon
to
contend
for
such
another
.
<EOS>
The
event
of
the
conflict
is
decisive
:
my
way
is
now
clear
;
I
thank
God
for
it
!
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
returned
to
his
papers
and
his
silence
.
  
<EOS>
As
our
mutual
happiness
(
_
i.e.
_
,
Diana
's
,
Mary
's
,
and
mine
)
settled
into
a
quieter
character
,
and
we
resumed
our
usual
habits
and
regular
studies
,
St.
John
stayed
more
at
home
:
he
sat
with
us
in
the
same
room
,
sometimes
for
hours
together
.
<EOS>
While
Mary
drew
,
Diana
pursued
a
course
of
encyclopaedic
reading
she
had
(
to
my
awe
and
amazement
)
undertaken
,
and
I
fagged
away
at
German
,
he
pondered
a
mystic
lore
of
his
own
:
that
of
some
Eastern
tongue
,
the
acquisition
of
which
he
thought
necessary
to
his
plans
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
engaged
,
he
appeared
,
sitting
in
his
own
recess
,
quiet
and
absorbed
enough
;
but
that
blue
eye
of
his
had
a
habit
of
leaving
the
outlandish-
looking
grammar
,
and
wandering
over
,
and
sometimes
fixing
upon
us
,
his
fellow
-
students
,
with
a
curious
intensity
of
observation
:
if
caught
,
it
would
be
instantly
withdrawn
;
yet
ever
and
anon
,
it
returned
searchingly
to
our
table
.
<EOS>
I
wondered
what
it
meant
:
I
wondered
,
too
,
at
the
punctual
satisfaction
he
never
failed
to
exhibit
on
an
occasion
that
seemed
to
me
of
small
moment
,
namely
,
my
weekly
visit
to
Morton
school
;
and
still
more
was
I
puzzled
when
,
if
the
day
was
unfavourable
,
if
there
was
snow
,
or
rain
,
or
high
wind
,
and
his
sisters
urged
me
not
to
go
,
he
would
invariably
make
light
of
their
solicitude
,
and
encourage
me
to
accomplish
the
task
without
regard
to
the
elements
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
is
not
such
a
weakling
as
you
would
make
her
,
"
he
would
say
:
"
she
can
bear
a
mountain
blast
,
or
a
shower
,
or
a
few
flakes
of
snow
,
as
well
as
any
of
us
.
<EOS>
Her
constitution
is
both
sound
and
elastic
;
 
better
calculated
to
endure
variations
of
climate
than
many
more
robust
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
when
I
returned
,
sometimes
a
good
deal
tired
,
and
not
a
little
weather
-
beaten
,
I
never
dared
complain
,
because
I
saw
that
to
murmur
would
be
to
vex
him
:
on
all
occasions
fortitude
pleased
him
;
the
reverse
was
a
special
annoyance
.
  
<EOS>
One
afternoon
,
however
,
I
got
leave
to
stay
at
home
,
because
I
really
had
a
cold
.
<EOS>
His
sisters
were
gone
to
Morton
in
my
stead
:
I
sat
reading
Schiller
;
he
,
deciphering
his
crabbed
Oriental
scrolls
.
<EOS>
As
I
exchanged
a
translation
for
an
exercise
,
I
happened
to
look
his
way
:
there
I
found
myself
under
the
influence
of
the
ever
-
watchful
blue
eye
.
<EOS>
How
long
it
had
been
searching
me
through
and
through
,
and
over
and
over
,
I
can
not
tell
:
<EOS>
so
keen
was
it
,
and
yet
so
cold
<EOS>
,
I
felt
for
the
moment
superstitious
 
as
if
I
were
sitting
in
the
room
with
something
uncanny
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
what
are
you
doing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Learning
German
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
give
up
German
and
learn
Hindostanee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
in
earnest
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
such
earnest
that
I
must
have
it
so
:
and
I
will
tell
you
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
went
on
to
explain
that
Hindostanee
was
the
language
he
was
himself
at
present
studying
;
that
,
as
he
advanced
,
he
was
apt
to
forget
the
commencement
;
that
it
would
assist
him
greatly
to
have
a
pupil
with
whom
he
might
again
and
again
go
over
the
elements
,
and
so
fix
them
thoroughly
in
his
mind
;
that
his
choice
had
hovered
for
some
time
between
me
and
his
sisters
;
but
that
he
had
fixed
on
me
because
he
saw
I
could
sit
at
a
task
the
longest
of
the
three
.
<EOS>
Would
I
do
him
this
favour
?
<EOS>
I
should
not
,
perhaps
,
have
to
make
the
sacrifice
long
,
as
it
wanted
now
barely
three
months
to
his
departure
.
  
<EOS>
St.
John
was
not
a
man
to
be
lightly
refused
:
you
felt
that
every
impression
made
on
him
,
either
for
pain
or
pleasure
,
was
deep
-
graved
and
permanent
.
<EOS>
I
consented
.
<EOS>
When
Diana
and
Mary
returned
,
the
former
found
her
scholar
transferred
from
her
to
her
brother
:
she
laughed
,
and
both
she
and
Mary
agreed
that
St.
John
should
never
have
persuaded
them
to
such
a
step
.
<EOS>
He
answered
quietly
    
"
I
know
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
found
him
a
very
patient
,
very
forbearing
,
and
yet
an
exacting
master
:
he
expected
me
to
do
a
great
deal
;
and
when
I
fulfilled
his
expectations
,
he
,
in
his
own
way
,
fully
testified
his
approbation
.
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
he
acquired
a
certain
influence
over
me
that
took
away
my
liberty
of
mind
:
his
praise
and
notice
were
more
restraining
than
his
indifference
.
<EOS>
I
could
no
longer
talk
or
laugh
freely
when
he
was
by
,
because
a
tiresomely
importunate
instinct
reminded
me
that
vivacity
(
at
least
in
me
)
was
distasteful
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
fully
aware
that
only
serious
moods
and
occupations
were
acceptable
,
that
in
his
presence
every
effort
to
sustain
or
follow
any
other
became
vain
<EOS>
:
I
fell
under
a
freezing
spell
.
<EOS>
When
he
said
"
go
,
"
I
went
;
"
come
,
"
I
came
;
"
<EOS>
do
this
,
"
I
did
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
did
not
love
my
servitude
:
I
wished
,
many
a
time
,
he
had
continued
to
neglect
me
.
  
<EOS>
One
evening
when
,
at
bedtime
,
his
sisters
and
I
stood
round
him
,
bidding
him
good
-
night
,
he
kissed
each
of
them
,
as
was
his
custom
;
and
,
as
was
equally
his
custom
,
he
gave
me
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Diana
,
who
chanced
to
be
in
a
frolicsome
humour
<EOS>
(
_
<EOS>
she
_
was
not
painfully
controlled
by
his
will
;
for
hers
,
in
another
way
,
was
as
strong
)
,
exclaimed
    
"
St.
John
!
<EOS>
you
used
to
call
Jane
your
third
sister
,
but
you
do
n't
treat
her
as
such
:
you
should
kiss
her
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
pushed
me
towards
him
.
<EOS>
I
thought
Diana
very
provoking
,
and
felt
uncomfortably
confused
;
and
while
I
was
thus
thinking
and
feeling
,
St.
John
bent
his
head
;
his
Greek
face
was
brought
to
a
level
with
mine
,
his
eyes
questioned
my
eyes
<EOS>
piercingly
 
he
kissed
me
.
<EOS>
There
are
no
such
things
as
marble
kisses
or
ice
kisses
,
or
I
should
say
my
ecclesiastical
cousin
's
salute
belonged
to
one
of
these
classes
;
but
there
may
be
experiment
kisses
,
and
his
was
an
experiment
kiss
.
<EOS>
When
given
,
he
viewed
me
to
learn
the
result
;
it
was
not
striking
:
I
am
sure
I
did
not
blush
;
perhaps
I
might
have
turned
a
little
pale
,
for
I
felt
as
if
this
kiss
were
a
seal
affixed
to
my
fetters
.
<EOS>
He
never
omitted
the
ceremony
afterwards
,
and
the
gravity
and
quiescence
with
which
I
underwent
it
,
seemed
to
invest
it
for
him
with
a
certain
charm
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
I
daily
wished
more
to
please
him
;
but
to
do
so
,
I
felt
daily
more
and
more
that
I
must
disown
half
my
nature
,
stifle
half
my
faculties
,
wrest
my
tastes
from
their
original
bent
,
force
myself
to
the
adoption
of
pursuits
for
which
I
had
no
natural
vocation
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
to
train
me
to
an
elevation
I
could
never
reach
;
it
racked
me
hourly
to
aspire
to
the
standard
he
uplifted
.
<EOS>
The
thing
was
as
impossible
as
to
mould
my
irregular
features
to
his
correct
and
classic
pattern
,
to
give
to
my
changeable
green
eyes
the
sea
-
blue
tint
and
solemn
lustre
of
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
Not
his
ascendancy
alone
,
however
,
held
me
in
thrall
at
present
.
<EOS>
Of
late
it
had
been
easy
enough
for
me
to
look
sad
:
a
cankering
evil
sat
at
my
heart
and
drained
my
happiness
at
its
source
 
the
evil
of
suspense
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
think
I
had
forgotten
Mr.
Rochester
,
reader
,
amidst
these
changes
of
place
and
fortune
.
<EOS>
Not
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
His
idea
was
still
with
me
,
because
it
was
not
a
vapour
sunshine
could
disperse
,
nor
a
sand
-
traced
effigy
storms
could
wash
away
;
it
was
a
name
graven
on
a
tablet
,
fated
to
last
as
long
as
the
marble
it
inscribed
.
<EOS>
The
craving
to
know
what
had
become
of
him
followed
me
everywhere
;
when
I
was
at
Morton
,
I
re
-
entered
my
cottage
every
evening
to
think
of
that
;
and
now
at
Moor
House
,
I
sought
my
bedroom
each
night
to
brood
over
it
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
my
necessary
correspondence
with
Mr.
Briggs
about
the
will
,
I
had
inquired
if
he
knew
anything
of
Mr.
Rochester
's
present
residence
and
state
of
health
;
but
,
as
St.
John
had
conjectured
,
he
was
quite
ignorant
of
all
concerning
him
.
<EOS>
I
then
wrote
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
entreating
information
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
I
had
calculated
with
certainty
on
this
step
answering
my
end
:
I
felt
sure
it
would
elicit
an
early
answer
.
<EOS>
I
was
astonished
when
a
fortnight
passed
without
reply
;
but
when
two
months
wore
away
,
and
day
after
day
the
post
arrived
and
brought
nothing
for
me
,
I
fell
a
prey
to
the
keenest
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
I
wrote
again
:
there
was
a
chance
of
my
first
letter
having
missed
.
<EOS>
Renewed
hope
followed
renewed
effort
:
it
shone
like
the
former
for
some
weeks
,
then
,
like
it
<EOS>
,
it
faded
,
flickered
:
not
<EOS>
a
line
,
not
a
word
reached
me
.
<EOS>
When
half
a
year
wasted
in
vain
expectancy
,
my
hope
died
out
,
and
then
I
felt
dark
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
A
fine
spring
shone
round
me
,
which
I
could
not
enjoy
.
<EOS>
Summer
approached
;
Diana
tried
to
cheer
me
:
she
said
I
looked
ill
,
and
wished
to
accompany
me
to
the
sea
-
side
.
<EOS>
This
St.
John
opposed
;
he
said
I
did
not
want
dissipation
<EOS>
,
I
wanted
employment
;
my
present
life
was
too
purposeless
<EOS>
,
I
required
an
aim
;
and
,
I
suppose
,
by
way
of
supplying
deficiencies
,
he
prolonged
still
further
my
lessons
in
Hindostanee
,
and
grew
more
urgent
in
requiring
their
accomplishment
:
and
I
,
like
a
fool
,
never
thought
of
resisting
him
 
I
could
not
resist
him
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
I
had
come
to
my
studies
in
lower
spirits
than
usual
;
the
ebb
was
occasioned
by
a
poignantly
felt
disappointment
.
<EOS>
Hannah
had
told
me
in
the
morning
there
was
a
letter
for
me
,
and
when
I
went
down
to
take
it
,
almost
certain
that
the
long
-
looked
for
tidings
were
vouchsafed
me
at
last
,
I
found
only
an
unimportant
note
from
Mr.
Briggs
on
business
.
<EOS>
The
bitter
check
had
wrung
from
me
some
tears
;
and
now
,
as
I
sat
poring
over
the
crabbed
characters
and
flourishing
tropes
of
an
Indian
scribe
,
my
eyes
filled
again
.
  
<EOS>
St.
John
called
me
to
his
side
to
read
;
in
attempting
to
do
this
my
voice
failed
me
:
words
were
lost
in
sobs
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
were
the
only
occupants
of
the
parlour
:
<EOS>
Diana
was
practising
her
music
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
Mary
was
gardening
 
<EOS>
it
was
a
very
fine
May
day
,
clear
,
sunny
,
and
breezy
.
<EOS>
My
companion
expressed
no
surprise
at
this
emotion
,
nor
did
he
question
me
as
to
its
cause
;
he
only
said
    
"
We
will
wait
a
few
minutes
,
Jane
,
till
you
are
more
composed
.
"
<EOS>
And
while
I
smothered
the
paroxysm
with
all
haste
,
he
sat
calm
and
patient
,
leaning
on
his
desk
,
and
looking
like
a
physician
watching
with
the
eye
of
science
an
expected
and
fully
understood
crisis
in
a
patient
's
malady
.
<EOS>
Having
stifled
my
sobs
,
wiped
my
eyes
,
and
muttered
something
about
not
being
very
well
that
morning
,
I
resumed
my
task
,
and
succeeded
in
completing
it
.
<EOS>
St.
John
put
away
my
books
and
his
,
locked
his
desk
,
and
said
    
"
Now
,
Jane
,
you
shall
take
a
walk
;
and
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
call
Diana
and
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
want
only
one
companion
this
morning
,
and
that
must
be
you
.
<EOS>
Put
on
your
things
;
go
out
by
the
kitchen
-
door
:
take
the
road
towards
the
head
of
Marsh
Glen
<EOS>
:
I
will
join
you
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
know
no
medium
:
I
never
in
my
life
have
known
any
medium
in
my
dealings
with
positive
,
hard
characters
,
antagonistic
to
my
own
,
between
absolute
submission
and
determined
revolt
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
faithfully
observed
the
one
,
up
to
the
very
moment
of
bursting
,
sometimes
with
volcanic
vehemence
,
into
the
other
;
and
as
neither
present
circumstances
warranted
,
nor
my
present
mood
inclined
me
to
mutiny
,
I
observed
careful
obedience
to
St.
John
's
directions
;
and
in
ten
minutes
I
was
treading
the
wild
track
of
the
glen
,
side
by
side
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
breeze
was
from
the
west
:
it
came
over
the
hills
,
sweet
with
scents
of
heath
and
rush
;
the
sky
was
of
stainless
blue
;
the
stream
descending
the
ravine
,
swelled
with
past
spring
rains
,
poured
along
plentiful
and
clear
,
catching
golden
gleams
from
the
sun
,
and
sapphire
tints
from
the
firmament
.
<EOS>
As
we
advanced
and
left
the
track
,
we
trod
a
soft
turf
,
mossy
fine
and
emerald
green
,
minutely
enamelled
with
a
tiny
white
flower
,
and
spangled
with
a
star
-
like
yellow
blossom
:
the
hills
,
meantime
,
shut
us
quite
in
;
for
the
glen
,
towards
its
head
,
wound
to
their
very
core
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
rest
here
,
"
said
St.
John
,
as
we
reached
the
first
stragglers
of
a
battalion
of
rocks
,
guarding
a
sort
of
pass
,
beyond
which
the
beck
rushed
down
a
waterfall
;
and
where
,
still
a
little
farther
,
the
mountain
shook
off
turf
and
flower
,
had
only
heath
for
raiment
and
crag
for
gem
 
where
it
exaggerated
the
wild
to
the
savage
,
and
exchanged
the
fresh
for
the
frowning
 
where
it
guarded
the
forlorn
hope
of
solitude
,
and
a
last
refuge
for
silence
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
a
seat
:
St.
John
stood
near
me
.
<EOS>
He
looked
up
the
pass
and
down
the
hollow
;
his
glance
wandered
away
with
the
stream
,
and
returned
to
traverse
the
unclouded
heaven
which
coloured
it
<EOS>
:
he
removed
his
hat
,
let
the
breeze
stir
his
hair
and
kiss
his
brow
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
in
communion
with
the
genius
of
the
haunt
:
with
his
eye
he
bade
farewell
to
something
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
shall
see
it
again
,
"
he
said
aloud
,
"
in
dreams
when
I
sleep
by
the
Ganges
:
and
again
in
a
more
remote
hour
 
when
another
slumber
overcomes
me
 
on
the
shore
of
a
darker
stream
!
"
  
<EOS>
Strange
words
of
a
strange
love
!
<EOS>
An
austere
patriot
's
passion
for
his
fatherland
!
<EOS>
He
sat
down
;
for
half
-
an
-
hour
we
never
spoke
;
neither
he
to
me
nor
I
to
him
:
that
interval
past
,
he
recommenced
    
"
Jane
,
I
go
in
six
weeks
;
I
have
taken
my
berth
in
an
East
Indiaman
which
sails
on
the
20th
of
June
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
God
will
protect
you
;
for
you
have
undertaken
His
work
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
he
,
"
there
is
my
glory
and
joy
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
servant
of
an
infallible
Master
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
out
under
human
guidance
,
subject
to
the
defective
laws
and
erring
control
of
my
feeble
fellow
-
worms
:
my
king
,
my
lawgiver
,
my
captain
,
is
the
All
-
perfect
.
<EOS>
It
seems
strange
to
me
that
all
round
me
do
not
burn
to
enlist
under
the
same
banner
,
 
to
join
in
the
same
enterprise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
have
not
your
powers
,
and
it
would
be
folly
for
the
feeble
to
wish
to
march
with
the
strong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
speak
to
the
feeble
,
or
think
of
them
:
I
address
only
such
as
are
worthy
of
the
work
,
and
competent
to
accomplish
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Those
are
few
in
number
,
and
difficult
to
discover
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
truly
;
but
when
found
,
it
is
right
to
stir
them
up
 
to
urge
and
exhort
them
to
the
effort
 
to
show
them
what
their
gifts
are
,
and
why
they
were
given
 
to
speak
Heaven
's
message
in
their
ear
,
 
to
offer
them
,
direct
from
God
,
a
place
in
the
ranks
of
His
chosen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
they
are
really
qualified
for
the
task
,
will
not
their
own
hearts
be
the
first
to
inform
them
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
felt
as
if
an
awful
charm
was
framing
round
and
gathering
over
me
:
<EOS>
I
trembled
to
hear
some
fatal
word
spoken
which
would
at
once
declare
and
rivet
the
spell
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
does
_
your
_
heart
say
?
"
demanded
St.
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
heart
is
mute
,
 
<EOS>
my
heart
is
mute
,
"
I
answered
,
struck
and
thrilled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
must
speak
for
it
,
"
continued
the
deep
,
relentless
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Jane
,
come
with
me
to
India
:
come
as
my
helpmeet
and
fellow
-
labourer
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
glen
and
sky
spun
round
:
the
hills
heaved
!
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
I
had
heard
a
summons
from
Heaven
 
as
if
a
visionary
messenger
,
like
him
of
Macedonia
,
had
enounced
,
"
Come
over
and
help
us
!
"
<EOS>
But
I
was
no
apostle
,
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
behold
the
herald
,
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
receive
his
call
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
St.
John
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
,
"
have
some
mercy
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
appealed
to
one
who
,
in
the
discharge
of
what
he
believed
his
duty
,
knew
neither
mercy
nor
remorse
.
<EOS>
He
continued
    
"
God
and
nature
intended
you
for
a
missionary
's
wife
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
personal
,
but
mental
endowments
they
have
given
you
:
<EOS>
you
are
formed
for
labour
,
not
for
love
.
<EOS>
A
missionary
's
wife
you
must
 
shall
be
.
<EOS>
You
shall
be
mine
<EOS>
:
I
claim
you
 
not
for
my
pleasure
,
but
for
my
Sovereign
's
service
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
fit
for
it
:
I
have
no
vocation
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
calculated
on
these
first
objections
:
he
was
not
irritated
by
them
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
as
he
leaned
back
against
the
crag
behind
him
,
folded
his
arms
on
his
chest
,
and
fixed
his
countenance
,
I
saw
he
was
prepared
for
a
long
and
trying
opposition
,
and
had
taken
in
a
stock
of
patience
to
last
him
to
its
close
 
resolved
,
however
,
that
that
close
should
be
conquest
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Humility
,
Jane
,
"
said
he
,
"
is
the
groundwork
of
Christian
virtues
:
you
say
right
that
you
are
not
fit
for
the
work
.
<EOS>
Who
is
fit
for
it
?
<EOS>
Or
who
,
that
ever
was
truly
called
,
believed
himself
worthy
of
the
summons
?
<EOS>
I
,
for
instance
,
am
but
dust
and
ashes
.
<EOS>
With
St.
Paul
,
I
acknowledge
myself
the
chiefest
of
sinners
;
but
I
do
not
suffer
this
sense
of
my
personal
vileness
to
daunt
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
Leader
:
that
He
is
just
as
well
as
mighty
;
and
while
He
has
chosen
a
feeble
instrument
to
perform
a
great
task
,
He
will
,
from
the
boundless
stores
of
His
providence
,
supply
the
inadequacy
of
the
means
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
Think
like
me
,
Jane
 
trust
like
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
Rock
of
Ages
<EOS>
I
ask
you
to
lean
on
:
<EOS>
do
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
it
will
bear
the
weight
of
your
human
weakness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
a
missionary
life
:
I
have
never
studied
missionary
labours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
I
,
humble
<EOS>
as
I
am
,
can
give
you
the
aid
you
want
:
I
can
set
you
your
task
from
hour
to
hour
;
stand
by
you
always
;
help
you
from
moment
to
moment
.
<EOS>
This
I
could
do
in
the
beginning
:
soon
(
for
I
know
your
powers
)
<EOS>
you
would
be
as
strong
and
apt
as
myself
,
and
would
not
require
my
help
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
my
powers
 
where
are
they
for
this
undertaking
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
feel
them
.
<EOS>
Nothing
speaks
or
stirs
in
me
while
you
talk
.
<EOS>
I
am
sensible
of
no
light
kindling
 
no
life
quickening
 
no
voice
counselling
or
cheering
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
wish
I
could
make
you
see
how
much
my
mind
is
at
this
moment
like
a
rayless
dungeon
,
with
one
shrinking
fear
fettered
in
its
depths
 
the
fear
of
being
persuaded
by
you
to
attempt
what
I
can
not
accomplish
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
an
answer
for
you
 
hear
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
watched
you
ever
since
we
first
met
:
I
have
made
you
my
study
for
ten
months
.
<EOS>
I
have
proved
you
in
that
time
by
sundry
tests
:
and
what
have
I
seen
and
elicited
?
<EOS>
In
the
village
school
I
found
you
could
perform
well
,
punctually
,
uprightly
,
labour
uncongenial
to
your
habits
and
inclinations
;
I
saw
you
could
perform
it
with
capacity
and
tact
:
you
could
win
while
you
controlled
.
<EOS>
In
the
calm
with
which
you
learnt
you
had
become
suddenly
rich
,
I
read
a
mind
clear
of
the
vice
of
Demas
:
 
lucre
had
no
undue
power
over
you
.
<EOS>
In
the
resolute
readiness
with
which
you
cut
your
wealth
into
four
shares
,
keeping
but
one
to
yourself
,
and
relinquishing
the
three
others
to
the
claim
of
abstract
justice
,
I
recognised
a
soul
that
revelled
in
the
flame
and
excitement
of
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
In
the
tractability
with
which
,
at
my
wish
,
you
forsook
a
study
in
which
you
were
interested
,
and
adopted
another
because
it
interested
me
;
in
the
untiring
assiduity
with
which
you
have
since
persevered
in
it
 
in
the
unflagging
energy
and
unshaken
temper
with
which
you
have
met
its
difficulties
 
<EOS>
I
acknowledge
the
complement
of
the
qualities
I
seek
.
<EOS>
Jane
,
you
are
docile
,
diligent
,
disinterested
,
faithful
,
constant
,
and
courageous
;
very
gentle
,
and
very
heroic
:
cease
to
mistrust
yourself
 
I
can
trust
you
unreservedly
.
<EOS>
As
a
conductress
of
Indian
schools
,
and
a
helper
amongst
Indian
women
,
your
assistance
will
be
to
me
invaluable
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
iron
shroud
contracted
round
me
;
persuasion
advanced
with
slow
sure
step
.
<EOS>
Shut
my
eyes
as
I
would
,
these
last
words
of
his
succeeded
in
making
the
way
,
which
had
seemed
blocked
up
,
comparatively
clear
.
<EOS>
My
work
,
which
had
appeared
so
vague
,
so
hopelessly
diffuse
,
condensed
itself
as
he
proceeded
,
and
assumed
a
definite
form
under
his
shaping
hand
.
<EOS>
He
waited
for
an
answer
.
<EOS>
I
demanded
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
think
,
before
I
again
hazarded
a
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
willingly
,
"
he
rejoined
;
and
rising
,
he
strode
a
little
distance
up
the
pass
,
threw
himself
down
on
a
swell
of
heath
,
and
there
lay
still
.

see

I
meditated
,
 
"
<EOS>
that
is
,
if
life
be
spared
me

<EOS>
But
I
feel
mine
is
not
the
existence
to
be
long
protracted
under
an
Indian
sun
.
<EOS>
What
then
?
<EOS>
He
does
not
care
for
that
:
when
my
time
came
to
die
,
he
would
resign
me
,
in
all
serenity
and
sanctity
,
to
the
God
who
gave
me
.
<EOS>
The
case
is
very
plain
before
me
.
<EOS>
In
leaving
England
,
I
should
leave
a
loved
but
empty
land
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
is
not
there
;
and
if
he
were
,
what
is
,
what
can
that
ever
be
to
me
?
<EOS>
My
business
is
to
live
without
him
now
:
nothing
so
absurd
,
so
weak
as
to
drag
on
from
day
to
day
,
as
if
I
were
waiting
some
impossible
change
in
circumstances
,
which
might
reunite
me
to
him
.
<EOS>
Of
course
(
as
St.
John
once
said
)
<EOS>
I
must
seek
another
interest
in
life
to
replace
the
one
lost
:
is
not
the
occupation
he
now
offers
me
truly
the
most
glorious
man
can
adopt
or
God
assign
?
<EOS>
Is
it
not
,
by
its
noble
cares
and
sublime
results
,
the
one
best
calculated
to
fill
the
void
left
by
uptorn
affections
and
demolished
hopes
?
<EOS>
I
believe
I
must
say
,
Yes
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
shudder
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
If
I
join
St.
John
,
I
abandon
half
myself
:
if
I
go
to
India
,
I
go
to
premature
death
.
<EOS>
And
how
will
the
interval
between
leaving
England
for
India
,
and
India
for
the
grave
,
be
filled
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
know
well
!
<EOS>
That
,
too
,
is
very
clear
to
my
vision
.
<EOS>
By
straining
to
satisfy
St.
John
till
my
sinews
ache
,
I
_
shall
_
satisfy
him
 
to
the
finest
central
point
and
farthest
outward
circle
of
his
expectations
.
<EOS>
If
I
_
do
_
go
with
him
 
if
I
_
do
<EOS>
_
make
the
sacrifice
he
urges
<EOS>
,
I
will
make
it
absolutely
:
I
will
throw
all
on
the
altar
 
heart
,
vitals
,
the
entire
victim
.
<EOS>
He
will
never
love
me
;
but
he
shall
approve
me
;
I
will
show
him
energies
he
has
not
yet
seen
,
resources
he
has
never
suspected
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
can
work
as
hard
as
he
can
,
and
with
as
little
grudging
.
  
<EOS>
"
Consent
,
then
,
to
his
demand
is
possible
:
but
for
one
item
 
one
dreadful
item
.
<EOS>
It
is
 
that
he
asks
me
to
be
his
wife
,
and
has
no
more
of
a
husband
's
heart
for
me
than
that
frowning
giant
of
a
rock
,
down
which
the
stream
is
foaming
in
yonder
gorge
.
<EOS>
He
prizes
me
as
a
soldier
would
a
good
weapon
;
and
that
is
all
.
<EOS>
Unmarried
to
him
,
this
would
never
grieve
me
;
but
can
I
let
him
complete
his
calculations
 
coolly
put
into
practice
his
plans
 
go
through
the
wedding
ceremony
?
<EOS>
Can
I
receive
from
him
the
bridal
ring
,
endure
all
the
forms
of
love
(
which
I
doubt
not
he
would
scrupulously
observe
)
and
know
that
the
spirit
was
quite
absent
?
<EOS>
Can
I
bear
the
consciousness
that
every
endearment
he
bestows
is
a
sacrifice
made
on
principle
?
<EOS>
No
:
such
a
martyrdom
would
be
monstrous
.
<EOS>
I
will
never
undergo
it
.
<EOS>
As
his
sister
,
I
might
accompany
him
 
not
as
his
wife
:
I
will
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
looked
towards
the
knoll
:
there
he
lay
,
still
as
a
prostrate
column
;
his
face
turned
to
me
:
his
eye
beaming
watchful
and
keen
.
<EOS>
He
started
to
his
feet
and
approached
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
ready
to
go
to
India
,
if
I
may
go
free
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
answer
requires
a
commentary
,
"
he
said
;
"
it
is
not
clear
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
hitherto
been
my
adopted
brother
 
I
,
your
adopted
sister
:
<EOS>
let
us
continue
as
such
:
<EOS>
you
and
I
had
better
not
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
Adopted
fraternity
will
not
do
in
this
case
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
my
real
sister
it
would
be
different
:
I
should
take
you
,
and
seek
no
wife
.
<EOS>
But
as
it
is
,
either
our
union
must
be
consecrated
and
sealed
by
marriage
,
or
it
can
not
exist
:
practical
obstacles
oppose
themselves
to
any
other
plan
.
<EOS>
Do
you
not
see
it
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
Consider
a
moment
 
your
strong
sense
will
guide
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
consider
;
and
still
my
sense
,
such
as
it
was
,
directed
me
only
to
the
fact
that
we
did
not
love
each
other
as
man
and
wife
<EOS>
should
:
<EOS>
and
therefore
it
inferred
we
ought
not
to
marry
.
<EOS>
I
said
so
.
"
<EOS>
St.
John
,
"
I
returned
,
"
I
regard
you
as
a
brother
 
you
,
me
as
a
sister
:
so
let
us
continue
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
not
 
we
can
not
,
"
he
answered
,
with
short
,
sharp
determination
:
"
it
would
not
do
.
<EOS>
You
have
said
you
will
go
with
me
to
India
<EOS>
:
remember
 
you
have
said
that
.
"
  
"
Conditionally
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
 
well
.
<EOS>
To
the
main
point
 
the
departure
with
me
from
England
,
the
co
-
operation
with
me
in
my
future
labours
 
you
do
not
object
.
<EOS>
You
have
already
as
good
as
put
your
hand
to
the
plough
<EOS>
:
you
are
too
consistent
to
withdraw
it
.
<EOS>
You
have
<EOS>
but
one
end
to
keep
in
view
 
<EOS>
how
the
work
you
have
undertaken
can
best
be
done
.
<EOS>
Simplify
your
complicated
interests
,
feelings
,
thoughts
,
wishes
,
aims
;
merge
all
considerations
in
one
purpose
:
that
of
fulfilling
with
effect
 
with
power
 
the
mission
of
your
great
Master
.
<EOS>
To
do
so
,
you
must
have
a
coadjutor
:
not
a
brother
 
that
is
a
loose
tie
 
but
a
husband
.
<EOS>
I
,
too
,
do
not
want
a
sister
:
a
sister
might
any
day
be
taken
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
want
a
wife
:
the
sole
helpmeet
I
can
influence
efficiently
in
life
,
and
retain
absolutely
till
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
shuddered
as
he
spoke
:
I
felt
his
influence
in
my
marrow
 
his
hold
on
my
limbs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Seek
one
elsewhere
than
in
me
,
St.
John
:
seek
one
fitted
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
fitted
to
my
purpose
,
you
mean
 
fitted
to
my
vocation
.
<EOS>
Again
I
tell
you
it
is
not
the
insignificant
private
individual
 
<EOS>
the
mere
man
,
with
the
man
's
selfish
senses
 
I
wish
to
mate
:
it
is
the
missionary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
will
give
the
missionary
my
energies
 
<EOS>
it
is
all
he
wants
 
but
not
myself
:
that
would
be
only
adding
the
husk
and
shell
to
the
kernel
.
<EOS>
For
them
he
has
no
use
:
I
retain
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
 
you
ought
not
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
God
will
be
satisfied
with
half
an
oblation
?
<EOS>
Will
He
accept
a
mutilated
sacrifice
?
<EOS>
It
is
the
cause
of
God
<EOS>
I
advocate
:
<EOS>
it
is
under
His
standard
I
enlist
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
accept
on
His
behalf
a
divided
allegiance
:
it
must
be
entire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
will
give
my
heart
to
God
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
_
You
_
do
not
want
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
swear
,
reader
,
that
there
was
not
something
of
repressed
sarcasm
both
in
the
tone
in
which
I
uttered
this
sentence
,
and
in
the
feeling
that
accompanied
it
.
<EOS>
I
had
silently
feared
St.
John
till
now
,
because
I
had
not
understood
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
held
me
in
awe
,
because
he
had
held
me
in
doubt
.
<EOS>
How
much
of
him
was
saint
,
<EOS>
how
much
mortal
,
I
could
not
heretofore
tell
:
<EOS>
but
revelations
were
being
made
in
this
conference
:
the
analysis
of
his
nature
was
proceeding
before
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
saw
his
fallibilities
:
I
comprehended
them
.
<EOS>
I
understood
that
,
sitting
there
where
I
did
,
on
the
bank
of
heath
,
and
with
that
handsome
form
before
me
,
I
sat
at
the
feet
of
a
man
,
caring
as
I.
The
veil
fell
from
his
hardness
and
despotism
.
<EOS>
Having
felt
in
him
the
presence
of
these
qualities
,
I
felt
his
imperfection
and
took
courage
.
<EOS>
I
was
with
an
equal
 
one
with
whom
I
might
argue
 
one
whom
,
if
I
saw
good
,
I
might
resist
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
silent
after
I
had
uttered
the
last
sentence
,
and
I
presently
risked
an
upward
glance
at
his
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
His
eye
,
bent
on
me
,
expressed
at
once
stern
surprise
and
keen
inquiry
.
<EOS>
"
Is
she
sarcastic
,
and
sarcastic
to
_
me
_
!
"
it
seemed
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
What
does
this
signify
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
let
us
forget
that
this
is
a
solemn
matter
,
"
he
said
ere
long
;
"
one
of
which
we
may
neither
think
nor
talk
lightly
without
sin
.
<EOS>
I
trust
,
Jane
,
you
are
in
earnest
when
you
say
you
will
serve
your
heart
to
God
:
it
is
all
I
want
.
<EOS>
Once
wrench
your
heart
from
man
,
and
fix
it
on
your
Maker
,
the
advancement
of
that
Maker
's
spiritual
kingdom
on
earth
will
be
your
chief
delight
and
endeavour
;
you
will
be
ready
to
do
at
once
whatever
furthers
that
end
.
<EOS>
You
will
see
what
impetus
would
be
given
to
your
efforts
and
mine
by
our
physical
and
mental
union
in
marriage
:
<EOS>
the
only
union
that
gives
a
character
of
permanent
conformity
to
the
destinies
and
designs
of
human
beings
;
and
,
passing
over
all
minor
caprices
 
all
trivial
difficulties
and
delicacies
of
feeling
 
all
scruple
about
the
degree
,
kind
,
strength
or
tenderness
of
mere
personal
inclination
 
you
will
hasten
to
enter
into
that
union
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
said
briefly
;
and
I
looked
at
his
features
,
beautiful
in
their
harmony
,
but
strangely
formidable
in
their
still
severity
;
at
his
brow
,
commanding
but
not
open
;
at
his
eyes
,
bright
and
deep
and
searching
,
but
never
soft
;
at
his
tall
imposing
figure
;
and
fancied
myself
in
idea
_
his
wife
_
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
would
never
do
!
<EOS>
As
his
curate
,
his
comrade
,
all
would
be
right
:
I
would
cross
oceans
with
him
in
that
capacity
;
toil
under
Eastern
suns
,
in
Asian
deserts
with
him
in
that
office
;
admire
and
emulate
his
courage
and
devotion
and
vigour
;
accommodate
quietly
to
his
masterhood
;
smile
undisturbed
at
his
ineradicable
ambition
;
discriminate
the
Christian
from
the
man
:
profoundly
esteem
the
one
,
and
freely
forgive
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
should
suffer
often
,
no
doubt
,
attached
to
him
only
in
this
capacity
:
my
body
would
be
under
rather
a
stringent
yoke
,
but
my
heart
and
mind
would
be
free
.
<EOS>
I
should
still
have
my
unblighted
self
to
turn
to
:
my
natural
unenslaved
feelings
with
which
to
communicate
in
moments
of
loneliness
.
<EOS>
There
would
be
recesses
in
my
mind
which
would
be
only
mine
,
to
which
he
never
came
,
and
sentiments
growing
there
fresh
and
sheltered
which
his
austerity
could
never
blight
,
nor
his
measured
warrior
-
march
trample
down
:
but
as
his
wife
 
at
his
side
always
,
and
always
restrained
,
and
always
checked
 
forced
to
keep
the
fire
of
my
nature
continually
low
,
to
compel
it
to
burn
inwardly
and
never
utter
a
cry
,
though
the
imprisoned
flame
consumed
vital
after
vital
 
_
<EOS>
this
_
would
be
unendurable
.
  
<EOS>
"
St.
John
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
,
when
I
had
got
so
far
in
my
meditation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
he
answered
icily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
I
freely
consent
to
go
with
you
as
your
fellow
-
missionary
,
but
not
as
your
wife
;
I
can
not
marry
you
and
become
part
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
part
of
me
you
must
become
,
"
he
answered
steadily
;
"
otherwise
the
whole
bargain
is
void
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
,
a
man
not
yet
thirty
,
take
out
with
me
to
India
a
girl
of
nineteen
,
unless
she
be
married
to
me
?
<EOS>
How
can
we
be
for
ever
together
 
sometimes
in
solitudes
,
sometimes
amidst
savage
tribes
 
and
unwed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
I
said
shortly
;
"
under
the
circumstances
,
quite
as
well
as
if
I
were
either
your
real
sister
,
or
a
man
and
a
clergyman
like
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
known
that
you
are
not
my
sister
;
I
can
not
introduce
you
as
such
:
to
attempt
it
would
be
to
fasten
injurious
suspicions
on
us
both
.
<EOS>
And
for
the
rest
,
though
you
have
a
man
's
vigorous
brain
,
you
have
a
woman
's
heart
and
 
it
would
not
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
do
,
"
I
affirmed
with
some
disdain
,
"
perfectly
well
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
woman
's
heart
,
but
not
where
you
are
concerned
;
for
you
I
have
only
a
comrade
's
constancy
;
a
fellow
-
soldier
's
frankness
,
fidelity
,
fraternity
,
if
you
like
;
a
neophyte
's
respect
and
submission
to
his
hierophant
:
nothing
more
 
do
n't
fear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
what
I
want
,
"
he
said
,
speaking
to
himself
;
"
it
is
just
what
I
want
.
<EOS>
And
there
are
obstacles
in
the
way
:
they
must
be
hewn
down
.
<EOS>
Jane
,
you
would
not
repent
marrying
me
 
<EOS>
be
certain
of
that
;
we
_
<EOS>
must
_
be
married
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
it
:
there
is
no
other
way
;
and
undoubtedly
enough
of
love
would
follow
upon
marriage
to
render
the
union
right
even
in
your
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
scorn
your
idea
of
love
,
"
I
could
not
help
saying
,
as
I
rose
up
and
stood
before
him
,
leaning
my
back
against
the
rock
.
<EOS>
"
I
scorn
the
counterfeit
sentiment
you
offer
:
yes
,
St.
John
,
and
I
scorn
you
when
you
offer
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
fixedly
,
compressing
his
well
-
cut
lips
while
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
Whether
he
was
incensed
or
surprised
,
or
what
,
it
was
not
easy
to
tell
:
he
could
command
his
countenance
thoroughly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
scarcely
expected
to
hear
that
expression
from
you
,
"
he
said
:
"
I
think
I
have
done
and
uttered
nothing
to
deserve
scorn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
touched
by
his
gentle
tone
,
and
overawed
by
his
high
,
calm
mien
.
  
<EOS>
"
Forgive
me
the
words
,
St.
John
;
but
it
is
your
own
fault
that
I
have
been
roused
to
speak
so
unguardedly
.
<EOS>
You
have
introduced
a
topic
on
which
our
natures
are
at
variance
 
<EOS>
a
topic
we
should
never
discuss
<EOS>
:
the
very
name
of
love
is
an
apple
of
discord
between
us
.
<EOS>
If
the
reality
were
required
,
what
should
we
do
?
<EOS>
How
should
we
feel
?
<EOS>
My
dear
cousin
,
abandon
your
scheme
of
marriage
 
forget
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
he
;
"
it
is
a
long
-
cherished
scheme
,
and
the
only
one
which
can
secure
my
great
end
:
<EOS>
but
I
shall
urge
you
no
further
at
present
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
,
I
leave
home
for
Cambridge
:
I
have
many
friends
there
to
whom
I
should
wish
to
say
farewell
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
absent
a
fortnight
 
<EOS>
take
that
space
of
time
to
consider
my
offer
:
and
do
not
forget
that
if
you
reject
it
,
it
is
not
me
you
deny
,
but
God
.
<EOS>
Through
my
means
,
He
opens
to
you
a
noble
career
;
as
my
wife
only
can
you
enter
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Refuse
to
be
my
wife
,
and
you
limit
yourself
for
ever
to
a
track
of
selfish
ease
and
barren
obscurity
.
<EOS>
Tremble
lest
in
that
case
you
should
be
numbered
with
those
who
have
denied
the
faith
,
and
are
worse
than
infidels
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
done
.
<EOS>
Turning
from
me
,
he
once
more
  
"
Looked
to
river
,
looked
to
hill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
this
time
his
feelings
were
all
pent
in
his
heart
:
I
was
not
worthy
to
hear
them
uttered
.
<EOS>
As
I
walked
by
his
side
homeward
,
I
read
well
in
his
iron
silence
all
he
felt
towards
me
:
the
disappointment
of
an
austere
and
despotic
nature
,
which
has
met
resistance
where
it
expected
submission
 
<EOS>
the
disapprobation
of
a
cool
,
inflexible
judgment
,
which
has
detected
in
another
feelings
and
views
in
which
it
has
no
power
to
sympathise
:
in
short
,
as
a
man
,
he
would
have
wished
to
coerce
me
into
obedience
:
it
was
only
as
a
sincere
Christian
he
bore
so
patiently
with
my
perversity
,
and
allowed
so
long
a
space
for
reflection
and
repentance
.
  
<EOS>
That
night
,
after
he
had
kissed
his
sisters
,
he
thought
proper
to
forget
even
to
shake
hands
with
me
,
but
left
the
room
in
silence
.
<EOS>
I
 
<EOS>
who
,
though
I
had
no
love
,
had
much
friendship
for
him
 
was
hurt
by
the
marked
omission
:
so
much
hurt
that
tears
started
to
my
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
and
St.
John
have
been
quarrelling
,
Jane
,
"
said
Diana
,
"
during
your
walk
on
the
moor
.
<EOS>
But
go
after
him
;
he
is
now
lingering
in
the
passage
expecting
you
 
he
will
make
it
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
much
pride
under
such
circumstances
:
I
would
always
rather
be
happy
than
dignified
;
and
I
ran
after
him
 
he
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
St.
John
,
"
said
I.
  
"
Good
-
night
,
Jane
,
"
he
replied
calmly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
shake
hands
,
"
I
added
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
cold
,
loose
touch
,
he
impressed
on
my
fingers
!
<EOS>
He
was
deeply
displeased
by
what
had
occurred
that
day
;
cordiality
would
not
warm
,
nor
tears
move
him
.
<EOS>
No
happy
reconciliation
was
to
be
had
with
him
 
no
cheering
smile
or
generous
word
:
but
still
the
Christian
was
patient
and
placid
;
and
when
I
asked
him
if
he
forgave
me
,
he
answered
that
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
cherishing
the
remembrance
of
vexation
;
that
he
had
nothing
to
forgive
,
not
having
been
offended
.
  
<EOS>
And
with
that
answer
he
left
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
much
rather
he
had
knocked
me
down
.
    
<EOS>
He
did
not
leave
for
Cambridge
the
next
day
,
as
he
had
said
he
would
.
<EOS>
He
deferred
his
departure
a
whole
week
,
and
during
that
time
he
made
me
feel
what
severe
punishment
a
good
yet
stern
,
<EOS>
a
conscientious
yet
implacable
man
can
inflict
on
one
who
has
offended
him
.
<EOS>
Without
one
overt
act
of
hostility
,
one
upbraiding
word
,
he
contrived
to
impress
me
momently
with
the
conviction
that
I
was
put
beyond
the
pale
of
his
favour
.
  
<EOS>
Not
that
St.
John
harboured
a
spirit
of
unchristian
vindictiveness
 
not
that
he
would
have
injured
a
hair
of
my
head
,
if
it
had
been
fully
in
his
power
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Both
by
nature
and
principle
,
he
was
superior
to
the
mean
gratification
of
vengeance
:
he
had
forgiven
me
for
saying
I
scorned
him
and
his
love
,
but
he
had
not
forgotten
the
words
;
and
as
long
as
he
and
I
lived
he
never
would
forget
them
.
<EOS>
I
saw
by
his
look
,
when
he
turned
to
me
,
that
they
were
always
written
on
the
air
between
me
and
him
;
whenever
I
spoke
,
they
sounded
in
my
voice
to
his
ear
,
and
their
echo
toned
every
answer
he
gave
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
abstain
from
conversing
with
me
:
he
even
called
me
as
usual
each
morning
to
join
him
at
his
desk
;
and
I
fear
the
corrupt
man
within
him
had
a
pleasure
unimparted
to
,
and
unshared
by
,
the
pure
Christian
,
in
evincing
with
what
skill
he
could
,
while
acting
and
speaking
apparently
just
as
usual
,
extract
from
every
deed
and
every
phrase
the
spirit
of
interest
and
approval
which
had
formerly
communicated
a
certain
austere
charm
to
his
language
and
manner
.
<EOS>
To
me
,
he
was
in
reality
become
no
longer
flesh
,
but
marble
;
his
eye
was
a
cold
,
bright
,
blue
gem
;
his
tongue
a
speaking
instrument
 
nothing
more
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
was
torture
to
me
 
refined
,
lingering
torture
.
<EOS>
It
kept
up
a
slow
fire
of
indignation
and
a
trembling
trouble
of
grief
,
which
harassed
and
crushed
me
altogether
.
<EOS>
I
felt
how
 
if
I
were
his
wife
,
this
good
man
,
pure
as
the
deep
sunless
source
,
could
soon
kill
me
,
without
drawing
from
my
veins
a
single
drop
of
blood
,
or
receiving
on
his
own
crystal
conscience
the
faintest
stain
of
crime
.
<EOS>
Especially
I
felt
this
when
I
made
any
attempt
to
propitiate
him
.
<EOS>
No
ruth
met
my
ruth
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
experienced
no
suffering
from
estrangement
 
<EOS>
no
yearning
after
reconciliation
;
and
though
,
more
than
once
,
my
fast
falling
tears
blistered
the
page
over
which
we
both
bent
,
they
produced
no
more
effect
on
him
than
if
his
heart
had
been
really
a
matter
of
stone
or
metal
.
<EOS>
To
his
sisters
,
meantime
,
he
was
somewhat
kinder
than
usual
:
as
if
afraid
that
mere
coldness
would
not
sufficiently
convince
me
how
completely
I
was
banished
and
banned
,
he
added
the
force
of
contrast
;
and
this
I
am
sure
he
did
not
by
force
,
but
on
principle
.
  
<EOS>
The
night
before
he
left
home
,
happening
to
see
him
walking
in
the
garden
about
sunset
,
and
remembering
,
as
I
looked
at
him
,
that
this
man
,
alienated
as
he
now
was
,
had
once
saved
my
life
,
and
that
we
were
near
relations
,
I
was
moved
to
make
a
last
attempt
to
regain
his
friendship
.
<EOS>
I
went
out
and
approached
him
as
he
stood
leaning
over
the
little
gate
;
I
spoke
to
the
point
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
St.
John
,
I
am
unhappy
because
you
are
still
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
Let
us
be
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
are
friends
,
"
was
the
unmoved
reply
;
while
he
still
watched
the
rising
of
the
moon
,
which
he
had
been
contemplating
as
I
approached
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
St.
John
,
we
are
not
friends
as
we
were
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
we
not
?
<EOS>
That
is
wrong
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
wish
you
no
ill
and
all
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
,
St.
John
;
for
I
am
sure
you
are
incapable
of
wishing
any
one
ill
;
but
,
as
I
am
your
kinswoman
,
I
should
desire
somewhat
more
of
affection
than
that
sort
of
general
philanthropy
you
extend
to
mere
strangers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Your
wish
is
reasonable
,
and
I
am
far
from
regarding
you
as
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
,
spoken
in
a
cool
,
tranquil
tone
,
was
mortifying
and
baffling
enough
.
<EOS>
Had
I
attended
to
the
suggestions
of
pride
and
ire
,
I
should
immediately
have
left
him
;
but
something
worked
within
me
more
strongly
than
those
feelings
could
.
<EOS>
I
deeply
venerated
my
cousin
's
talent
and
principle
.
<EOS>
His
friendship
was
of
value
to
me
:
to
lose
it
tried
me
severely
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
so
soon
relinquish
the
attempt
to
reconquer
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Must
we
part
in
this
way
,
St.
John
?
<EOS>
And
when
you
go
to
India
,
will
you
leave
me
so
,
without
a
kinder
word
than
you
have
yet
spoken
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
now
turned
quite
from
the
moon
and
faced
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
go
to
India
,
Jane
,
will
I
leave
you
!
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
do
you
not
go
to
India
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
said
I
could
not
unless
I
married
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
not
marry
me
!
<EOS>
You
adhere
to
that
resolution
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Reader
,
do
you
know
,
as
I
do
,
what
terror
those
cold
people
can
put
into
the
ice
of
their
questions
?
<EOS>
How
much
of
the
fall
of
the
avalanche
is
in
their
anger
?
<EOS>
of
the
breaking
up
of
the
frozen
sea
in
their
displeasure
?
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
St.
John
,
I
will
not
marry
you
.
<EOS>
I
adhere
to
my
resolution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
avalanche
had
shaken
and
slid
a
little
forward
,
but
it
did
not
yet
crash
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Once
more
,
why
this
refusal
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Formerly
,
"
I
answered
,
"
because
you
did
not
love
me
;
now
,
I
reply
,
because
you
almost
hate
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
marry
you
,
you
would
kill
me
.
<EOS>
You
are
killing
me
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
lips
and
cheeks
turned
white
 
quite
white
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
I
should
kill
you
_
 
<EOS>
_
I
am
killing
you
_
?
<EOS>
Your
words
are
such
as
ought
not
to
be
used
:
violent
,
unfeminine
,
and
untrue
.
<EOS>
They
betray
an
unfortunate
state
of
mind
:
they
merit
severe
reproof
:
they
would
seem
inexcusable
,
but
that
it
is
the
duty
of
man
to
forgive
his
fellow
even
until
seventy
-
and
-
seven
times
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
finished
the
business
now
.
<EOS>
While
earnestly
wishing
to
erase
from
his
mind
the
trace
of
my
former
offence
,
I
had
stamped
on
that
tenacious
surface
another
and
far
deeper
impression
,
I
had
burnt
it
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
you
will
indeed
hate
me
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
useless
to
attempt
to
conciliate
you
:
<EOS>
I
see
I
have
made
an
eternal
enemy
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
fresh
wrong
did
these
words
inflict
:
<EOS>
the
worse
,
because
they
touched
on
the
truth
.
<EOS>
That
bloodless
lip
quivered
to
a
temporary
spasm
.
<EOS>
I
knew
the
steely
ire
I
had
whetted
.
<EOS>
I
was
heart
-
wrung
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
utterly
misinterpret
my
words
,
"
I
said
,
at
once
seizing
his
hand
:
"
I
have
no
intention
to
grieve
or
pain
you
 
indeed
,
I
have
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Most
bitterly
he
smiled
 
most
decidedly
<EOS>
he
withdrew
his
hand
from
mine
.
<EOS>
"
And
now
you
recall
your
promise
,
and
will
not
go
to
India
at
all
,
I
presume
?
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
after
a
considerable
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
will
,
as
your
assistant
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
A
very
long
silence
succeeded
.
<EOS>
What
struggle
there
was
in
him
between
Nature
and
Grace
in
this
interval
,
I
can
not
tell
:
only
singular
gleams
scintillated
in
his
eyes
,
and
strange
shadows
passed
over
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
before
proved
to
you
the
absurdity
of
a
single
woman
of
your
age
proposing
to
accompany
abroad
a
single
man
of
mine
.
<EOS>
I
proved
it
to
you
in
such
terms
as
,
I
should
have
thought
,
would
have
prevented
your
ever
again
alluding
to
the
plan
.
<EOS>
That
you
have
done
so
<EOS>
,
I
regret
 
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
interrupted
him
.
<EOS>
Anything
like
a
tangible
reproach
gave
me
courage
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
Keep
to
common
sense
,
St.
John
:
you
are
verging
on
nonsense
.
<EOS>
You
pretend
to
be
shocked
by
what
I
have
said
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
really
shocked
:
for
,
with
your
superior
mind
,
you
can
not
be
either
so
dull
or
so
conceited
as
to
misunderstand
my
meaning
.
<EOS>
I
say
again
,
I
will
be
your
curate
,
if
you
like
,
but
never
your
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Again
he
turned
lividly
pale
;
but
,
as
before
,
controlled
his
passion
perfectly
.
<EOS>
He
answered
emphatically
but
calmly
    
"
A
female
curate
,
who
is
not
my
wife
,
would
never
suit
me
.
<EOS>
With
me
,
then
,
it
seems
,
you
can
not
go
:
<EOS>
but
if
you
are
sincere
in
your
offer
,
I
will
,
while
in
town
,
speak
to
a
married
missionary
,
whose
wife
needs
a
coadjutor
.
<EOS>
Your
own
fortune
will
make
you
independent
of
the
Society
's
aid
;
and
thus
you
may
still
be
spared
the
dishonour
of
breaking
your
promise
and
deserting
the
band
you
engaged
to
join
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
I
never
had
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
either
given
any
formal
promise
or
entered
into
any
engagement
;
and
this
language
was
all
much
too
hard
and
much
too
despotic
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
replied
    
"
There
is
no
dishonour
,
no
breach
of
promise
,
no
desertion
in
the
case
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
under
the
slightest
obligation
to
go
to
India
,
especially
with
strangers
.
<EOS>
With
you
I
would
have
ventured
much
,
because
I
admire
,
confide
in
,
and
,
as
a
sister
,
I
love
you
;
but
I
am
convinced
that
,
go
when
and
with
whom
I
would
,
I
should
not
live
long
in
that
climate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
are
afraid
of
yourself
,
"
he
said
,
curling
his
lip
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
.
<EOS>
God
did
not
give
me
my
life
to
throw
away
;
and
to
do
as
you
wish
me
would
,
I
begin
to
think
,
be
almost
equivalent
to
committing
suicide
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
before
I
definitively
resolve
on
quitting
England
,
I
will
know
for
certain
whether
I
can
not
be
of
greater
use
by
remaining
in
it
than
by
leaving
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
fruitless
to
attempt
to
explain
;
but
there
is
a
point
on
which
I
have
long
endured
painful
doubt
,
and
I
can
go
nowhere
till
by
some
means
that
doubt
is
removed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
where
your
heart
turns
and
to
what
it
clings
.
<EOS>
The
interest
you
cherish
is
lawless
and
unconsecrated
.
<EOS>
Long
since
you
ought
to
have
crushed
it
:
now
you
should
blush
to
allude
to
it
.
<EOS>
You
think
of
Mr.
Rochester
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
true
.
<EOS>
I
confessed
it
by
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
seek
Mr.
Rochester
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
find
out
what
is
become
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
remains
for
me
,
then
,
"
he
said
,
"
to
remember
you
in
my
prayers
,
and
to
entreat
God
for
you
,
in
all
earnestness
,
that
you
may
not
indeed
become
a
castaway
.
<EOS>
I
had
thought
I
recognised
in
you
one
of
the
chosen
.
<EOS>
But
God
sees
not
as
man
sees
:
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
His
_
will
be
done
 
"
  
<EOS>
He
opened
the
gate
,
passed
through
it
,
and
strayed
away
down
the
glen
.
<EOS>
He
was
soon
out
of
sight
.
  
<EOS>
On
re
-
entering
the
parlour
,
I
found
Diana
standing
at
the
window
,
looking
very
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
Diana
was
a
great
deal
taller
than
I
:
she
put
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
and
,
stooping
,
examined
my
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
"
she
said
,
"
you
are
always
agitated
and
pale
now
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
there
is
something
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
what
business
St.
John
and
you
have
on
hands
.
<EOS>
I
have
watched
you
this
half
hour
from
the
window
;
you
must
forgive
my
being
such
a
spy
,
but
for
a
long
time
I
have
fancied
I
hardly
know
what
.
<EOS>
St.
John
is
a
strange
being
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
speak
:
soon
she
resumed
    
"
That
brother
of
mine
cherishes
peculiar
views
of
some
sort
respecting
you
,
I
am
sure
:
he
has
long
distinguished
you
by
a
notice
and
interest
he
never
showed
to
any
one
else
 
to
what
end
?
<EOS>
I
wish
he
loved
you
 
<EOS>
does
he
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
put
her
cool
hand
to
my
hot
forehead
;
"
No
,
Die
,
not
one
whit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
does
he
follow
you
so
with
his
eyes
,
and
get
you
so
frequently
alone
with
him
,
and
keep
you
so
continually
at
his
side
?
<EOS>
Mary
and
I
had
both
concluded
he
wished
you
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
does
 
<EOS>
he
has
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Diana
clapped
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
just
what
we
hoped
and
thought
!
<EOS>
And
you
will
marry
him
,
Jane
,
wo
n't
you
?
<EOS>
And
then
he
will
stay
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Far
from
that
,
Diana
;
his
sole
idea
in
proposing
to
me
is
to
procure
a
fitting
fellow
-
labourer
in
his
Indian
toils
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
He
wishes
you
to
go
to
India
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
"
Madness
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
live
three
months
there
,
I
am
certain
.
<EOS>
You
never
shall
go
:
you
have
not
consented
,
have
you
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
refused
to
marry
him
 
"
  
"
And
have
consequently
displeased
him
?
"
she
suggested
.
  
<EOS>
"
Deeply
:
he
will
never
forgive
me
,
I
fear
:
<EOS>
yet
I
offered
to
accompany
him
as
his
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
frantic
folly
to
do
so
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
Think
of
the
task
you
undertook
 
one
of
incessant
fatigue
,
where
fatigue
kills
even
the
strong
,
and
you
are
weak
.
<EOS>
St.
John
 
you
know
him
 
would
urge
you
to
impossibilities
:
with
him
there
would
be
no
permission
to
rest
during
the
hot
hours
;
and
unfortunately
,
I
have
noticed
,
whatever
he
exacts
,
you
force
yourself
to
perform
.
<EOS>
I
am
astonished
<EOS>
you
found
courage
to
refuse
his
hand
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
love
him
then
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
as
a
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
he
is
a
handsome
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
so
plain
,
you
see
,
Die
.
<EOS>
We
should
never
suit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Plain
!
<EOS>
You
?
<EOS>
Not
at
all
.
<EOS>
You
are
much
too
pretty
,
as
well
as
too
good
,
to
be
grilled
alive
in
Calcutta
.
"
<EOS>
And
again
she
earnestly
conjured
me
to
give
up
all
thoughts
of
going
out
with
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
indeed
,
"
I
said
;
"
for
when
just
now
I
repeated
the
offer
of
serving
him
for
a
deacon
,
he
expressed
himself
shocked
at
my
want
of
decency
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
think
I
had
committed
an
impropriety
in
proposing
to
accompany
him
unmarried
:
as
if
I
had
not
from
the
first
hoped
to
find
in
him
a
brother
,
and
habitually
regarded
him
as
such
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
makes
you
say
he
does
not
love
you
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
hear
himself
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
He
has
again
and
again
explained
that
it
is
not
himself
,
but
his
office
he
wishes
to
mate
.
<EOS>
He
has
told
me
I
am
formed
for
labour
 
not
for
love
:
which
is
true
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
my
opinion
,
if
I
am
not
formed
for
love
,
it
follows
that
I
am
not
formed
for
marriage
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
strange
,
Die
,
to
be
chained
for
life
to
a
man
who
regarded
one
but
as
a
useful
tool
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Insupportable
 
unnatural
 
out
of
the
question
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
,
"
I
continued
,
"
though
I
have
only
sisterly
affection
for
him
now
,
yet
,
if
forced
to
be
his
wife
,
I
can
imagine
the
possibility
of
conceiving
an
inevitable
,
strange
,
torturing
kind
of
love
for
him
,
because
he
is
so
talented
;
and
there
is
often
a
certain
heroic
grandeur
in
his
look
,
manner
,
and
conversation
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
my
lot
would
become
unspeakably
wretched
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
want
me
to
love
him
;
and
if
I
showed
the
feeling
,
he
would
make
me
sensible
that
it
was
a
superfluity
,
unrequired
by
him
,
unbecoming
in
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
yet
St.
John
is
a
good
man
,
"
said
Diana
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
good
and
a
great
man
;
but
he
forgets
,
pitilessly
,
the
feelings
and
claims
of
little
people
,
in
pursuing
his
own
large
views
.
<EOS>
It
is
better
,
therefore
,
for
the
insignificant
to
keep
out
of
his
way
,
lest
,
in
his
progress
,
he
should
trample
them
down
.
<EOS>
Here
he
comes
!
<EOS>
I
will
leave
you
,
Diana
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
hastened
upstairs
as
I
saw
him
entering
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
was
forced
to
meet
him
again
at
supper
.
<EOS>
During
that
meal
he
appeared
just
as
composed
as
usual
.
<EOS>
I
had
thought
he
would
hardly
speak
to
me
,
and
I
was
certain
he
had
given
up
the
pursuit
of
his
matrimonial
scheme
<EOS>
:
the
sequel
showed
I
was
mistaken
on
both
points
.
<EOS>
He
addressed
me
precisely
in
his
ordinary
manner
,
or
what
had
,
of
late
,
been
his
ordinary
manner
 
one
scrupulously
polite
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
he
had
invoked
the
help
of
the
Holy
Spirit
to
subdue
the
anger
I
had
roused
in
him
,
and
now
believed
he
had
forgiven
me
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
evening
reading
before
prayers
,
he
selected
the
twenty
-
first
chapter
of
Revelation
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
all
times
pleasant
to
listen
while
from
his
lips
fell
the
words
of
the
Bible
:
never
did
his
fine
voice
sound
at
once
so
sweet
and
full
 
never
did
his
manner
become
so
impressive
in
its
noble
simplicity
,
as
when
he
delivered
the
oracles
of
God
:
and
to
-
night
that
voice
took
a
more
solemn
tone
 
that
manner
a
more
thrilling
meaning
 
as
he
sat
in
the
midst
of
his
household
circle
(
the
May
moon
shining
in
through
the
uncurtained
window
,
and
rendering
almost
unnecessary
the
light
of
the
candle
on
the
table
)
:
as
he
sat
there
,
bending
over
the
great
old
Bible
,
and
described
from
its
page
the
vision
of
the
new
heaven
and
the
new
earth
 
told
how
God
would
come
to
dwell
with
men
,
how
He
would
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes
,
and
promised
that
there
should
be
no
more
death
,
neither
sorrow
nor
crying
,
nor
any
more
pain
,
because
the
former
things
were
passed
away
.
  
<EOS>
The
succeeding
words
thrilled
me
strangely
as
he
spoke
them
:
especially
as
I
felt
,
by
the
slight
,
indescribable
alteration
in
sound
,
that
in
uttering
them
,
his
eye
had
turned
on
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
that
overcometh
shall
inherit
all
things
;
and
I
will
be
his
God
,
and
he
shall
be
my
son
.
<EOS>
But
,
"
was
slowly
,
distinctly
read
,
"
the
fearful
,
the
unbelieving
,
&
c.
,
shall
have
their
part
in
the
lake
which
burneth
with
fire
and
brimstone
,
which
is
the
second
death
.
"
  
<EOS>
Henceforward
,
I
knew
what
fate
<EOS>
St.
John
feared
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
A
calm
,
subdued
triumph
,
blent
with
a
longing
earnestness
,
marked
his
enunciation
of
the
last
glorious
verses
of
that
chapter
.
<EOS>
The
reader
believed
his
name
was
already
written
in
the
Lamb
's
book
of
life
,
and
he
yearned
after
the
hour
which
should
admit
him
to
the
city
to
which
the
kings
of
the
earth
bring
their
glory
and
honour
;
which
has
no
need
of
sun
or
moon
to
shine
in
it
,
because
the
glory
of
God
lightens
it
,
and
the
Lamb
is
the
light
thereof
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
prayer
following
the
chapter
,
all
his
energy
gathered
 
all
his
stern
zeal
woke
:
he
was
in
deep
earnest
,
wrestling
with
God
,
and
resolved
on
a
conquest
.
<EOS>
He
supplicated
strength
for
the
weak
-
hearted
;
guidance
for
wanderers
from
the
fold
:
a
return
,
even
at
the
eleventh
hour
,
for
those
whom
the
temptations
of
the
world
and
the
flesh
were
luring
from
the
narrow
path
.
<EOS>
He
asked
,
he
urged
,
he
claimed
the
boon
of
a
brand
snatched
from
the
burning
.
<EOS>
Earnestness
is
ever
deeply
solemn
:
first
,
as
I
listened
to
that
prayer
,
I
wondered
at
his
;
then
,
when
it
continued
and
rose
,
I
was
touched
by
it
,
and
at
last
awed
.
<EOS>
He
felt
the
greatness
and
goodness
of
his
purpose
so
sincerely
:
others
who
heard
him
plead
for
it
,
could
not
but
feel
it
too
.
  
<EOS>
The
prayer
over
<EOS>
,
we
took
leave
of
him
:
he
was
to
go
at
a
very
early
hour
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Diana
and
Mary
having
kissed
him
,
left
the
room
 
in
compliance
,
I
think
,
with
a
whispered
hint
from
him
:
I
tendered
my
hand
,
and
wished
him
a
pleasant
journey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
As
I
said
,
I
shall
return
from
Cambridge
in
a
fortnight
:
that
space
,
then
,
is
yet
left
you
for
reflection
.
<EOS>
If
I
listened
to
human
pride
,
I
should
say
no
more
to
you
of
marriage
with
me
;
but
I
listen
to
my
duty
,
and
keep
steadily
in
view
my
first
aim
 
to
do
all
things
to
the
glory
of
God
.
<EOS>
My
Master
was
long
-
suffering
:
so
will
I
be
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
give
you
up
to
perdition
as
a
vessel
of
wrath
:
<EOS>
repent
 
resolve
,
while
there
is
yet
time
.
<EOS>
Remember
,
we
are
bid
to
work
while
it
is
day
 
<EOS>
warned
that
"
the
night
cometh
when
no
man
shall
work
.
"
<EOS>
Remember
the
fate
of
Dives
,
who
had
his
good
things
in
this
life
.
<EOS>
God
give
you
strength
to
choose
that
better
part
which
shall
not
be
taken
from
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
laid
his
hand
on
my
head
as
he
uttered
the
last
words
.
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
earnestly
,
mildly
:
his
look
was
not
,
indeed
,
that
of
a
lover
beholding
his
mistress
,
but
it
was
that
of
a
pastor
recalling
his
wandering
sheep
 
or
better
,
of
a
guardian
angel
watching
the
soul
for
which
he
is
responsible
.
<EOS>
All
men
of
talent
,
whether
they
be
men
of
feeling
or
not
;
whether
they
be
zealots
,
or
aspirants
,
or
despots
 
<EOS>
provided
only
they
be
sincere
 
<EOS>
have
their
sublime
moments
,
when
they
subdue
and
rule
.
<EOS>
I
felt
veneration
for
St.
John
 
veneration
so
strong
that
its
impetus
thrust
me
at
once
to
the
point
I
had
so
long
shunned
.
<EOS>
I
was
tempted
to
cease
struggling
with
him
 
to
rush
down
the
torrent
of
his
will
into
the
gulf
of
his
existence
,
and
there
lose
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
was
almost
as
hard
beset
by
him
now
as
I
had
been
once
before
,
in
a
different
way
,
by
another
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
fool
both
times
.
<EOS>
To
have
yielded
then
would
have
been
an
error
of
principle
;
to
have
yielded
now
would
have
been
an
error
of
judgment
.
<EOS>
So
I
think
at
this
hour
,
when
I
look
back
to
the
crisis
through
the
quiet
medium
of
time
:
I
was
unconscious
of
folly
at
the
instant
.
  
<EOS>
I
stood
motionless
under
my
hierophant
's
touch
.
<EOS>
My
refusals
were
forgotten
 
<EOS>
my
fears
overcome
 
my
wrestlings
paralysed
.
<EOS>
The
Impossible
 
_
<EOS>
i.e.
_
,
my
marriage
with
St.
John
 
was
fast
becoming
the
Possible
.
<EOS>
All
was
changing
utterly
with
a
sudden
sweep
.
<EOS>
Religion
called
 
Angels
beckoned
 
God
commanded
 
life
rolled
together
like
a
scroll
 
death
's
gates
opening
,
showed
eternity
beyond
:
it
seemed
,
that
for
safety
and
bliss
there
,
all
here
might
be
sacrificed
in
a
second
.
<EOS>
The
dim
room
was
full
of
visions
.
  
<EOS>
"
Could
you
decide
now
?
"
asked
the
missionary
.
<EOS>
The
inquiry
was
put
in
gentle
tones
:
he
drew
me
to
him
as
gently
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
gentleness
!
<EOS>
how
far
more
potent
is
it
than
force
!
<EOS>
I
could
resist
St.
John
's
wrath
:
I
grew
pliant
as
a
reed
under
his
kindness
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
knew
all
the
time
,
if
I
yielded
now
,
I
should
not
the
less
be
made
to
repent
,
some
day
,
of
my
former
rebellion
.
<EOS>
His
nature
was
not
changed
by
one
hour
of
solemn
prayer
:
it
was
only
elevated
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
decide
if
I
were
but
certain
,
"
I
answered
:
"
were
I
but
convinced
that
it
is
God
's
will
<EOS>
I
should
marry
you
,
I
could
vow
to
marry
you
here
<EOS>
and
now
 
come
afterwards
<EOS>
what
would
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
prayers
are
heard
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
St.
John
.
<EOS>
He
pressed
his
hand
firmer
on
my
head
,
as
if
he
claimed
me
:
he
surrounded
me
with
his
arm
,
_
<EOS>
almost
_
<EOS>
as
if
he
loved
me
<EOS>
(
I
say
_
<EOS>
almost
_
 
<EOS>
I
knew
the
difference
 
<EOS>
for
I
had
felt
what
it
was
to
be
loved
;
but
,
like
him
,
I
had
now
put
love
out
of
the
question
,
and
thought
only
of
duty
)
.
<EOS>
I
contended
with
my
inward
dimness
of
vision
,
before
which
clouds
yet
rolled
.
<EOS>
I
sincerely
,
deeply
,
fervently
longed
to
do
what
was
right
;
and
only
that
.
"
<EOS>
Show
me
,
show
me
the
path
!
<EOS>
"
I
entreated
of
Heaven
.
<EOS>
I
was
excited
more
than
I
had
ever
been
;
and
whether
what
followed
was
the
effect
of
excitement
the
reader
shall
judge
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
house
was
still
;
for
I
believe
all
,
except
St.
John
and
myself
,
were
now
retired
to
rest
.
<EOS>
The
one
candle
was
dying
out
:
the
room
was
full
of
moonlight
.
<EOS>
My
heart
beat
fast
and
thick
:
I
heard
its
throb
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
it
stood
still
to
an
inexpressible
feeling
that
thrilled
it
through
,
and
passed
at
once
to
my
head
and
extremities
.
<EOS>
The
feeling
was
not
like
an
electric
shock
,
but
it
was
quite
as
sharp
,
as
strange
,
as
startling
<EOS>
:
it
acted
on
my
senses
as
if
their
utmost
activity
hitherto
had
been
but
torpor
,
from
which
they
were
now
summoned
and
forced
to
wake
.
<EOS>
They
rose
expectant
:
eye
and
ear
waited
while
the
flesh
quivered
on
my
bones
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
heard
?
<EOS>
What
do
you
see
?
"
asked
St.
John
.
<EOS>
I
saw
nothing
,
but
I
heard
a
voice
somewhere
cry
    
"
Jane
!
<EOS>
Jane
!
<EOS>
Jane
!
"
 
<EOS>
nothing
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
God
!
<EOS>
what
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
gasped
.
  
<EOS>
I
might
have
said
,
"
Where
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
for
it
did
not
seem
in
the
room
 
nor
in
the
house
 
nor
in
the
garden
;
it
did
not
come
out
of
the
air
 
nor
from
under
the
earth
 
nor
from
overhead
.
<EOS>
I
had
heard
it
 
where
,
or
whence
,
for
ever
impossible
to
know
!
<EOS>
And
it
was
the
voice
of
a
human
being
 
a
known
,
loved
,
well
-
remembered
voice
 
that
of
Edward
Fairfax
Rochester
;
and
it
spoke
in
pain
and
woe
,
wildly
,
eerily
,
urgently
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
coming
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Wait
for
me
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
will
come
!
<EOS>
"
I
flew
to
the
door
and
looked
into
the
passage
:
it
was
dark
.
<EOS>
I
ran
out
into
the
garden
:
it
was
void
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
.
  
<EOS>
The
hills
beyond
Marsh
Glen
sent
the
answer
faintly
back
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
?
<EOS>
"
I
listened
.
<EOS>
The
wind
sighed
low
in
the
firs
:
all
was
moorland
loneliness
and
midnight
hush
.
  
<EOS>
"
Down
superstition
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
commented
,
as
that
spectre
rose
up
black
by
the
black
yew
at
the
gate
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
thy
deception
,
nor
thy
witchcraft
:
it
is
the
work
of
nature
.
<EOS>
She
was
roused
,
and
did
 
no
miracle
 
but
her
best
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
broke
from
St.
John
,
who
had
followed
,
and
would
have
detained
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
_
<EOS>
my
_
time
to
assume
ascendency
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
My
_
powers
were
in
play
and
in
force
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
to
forbear
question
or
remark
;
I
desired
him
to
leave
me
:
I
must
and
would
be
alone
.
<EOS>
He
obeyed
at
once
.
<EOS>
Where
there
is
energy
to
command
well
enough
,
obedience
never
fails
.
<EOS>
I
mounted
to
my
chamber
;
locked
myself
in
;
fell
on
my
knees
;
and
prayed
in
my
way
 
a
different
way
to
St.
John
's
,
but
effective
in
its
own
fashion
.
<EOS>
I
seemed
to
penetrate
very
near
a
Mighty
Spirit
;
and
my
soul
rushed
out
in
gratitude
at
His
feet
.
<EOS>
I
rose
from
the
thanksgiving
 
<EOS>
took
a
resolve
 
and
lay
down
,
unscared
,
enlightened
 
<EOS>
eager
but
for
the
daylight
.
    
<EOS>
The
daylight
came
.
<EOS>
I
rose
at
dawn
.
<EOS>
I
busied
myself
for
an
hour
or
two
with
arranging
my
things
in
my
chamber
,
drawers
,
and
wardrobe
,
in
the
order
wherein
I
should
wish
to
leave
them
during
a
brief
absence
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
I
heard
St.
John
quit
his
room
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
at
my
door
:
I
feared
he
would
knock
 
<EOS>
no
,
but
a
slip
of
paper
was
passed
under
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
took
it
up
.
<EOS>
It
bore
these
words
    
<EOS>
"
You
left
me
too
suddenly
last
night
.
<EOS>
Had
you
stayed
but
a
little
longer
,
you
would
have
laid
your
hand
on
the
Christian
's
cross
and
the
angel
's
crown
.
<EOS>
I
shall
expect
your
clear
decision
when
I
return
this
day
fortnight
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
watch
and
pray
that
you
enter
not
into
temptation
:
the
spirit
,
I
trust
,
is
willing
,
but
the
flesh
,
I
see
,
is
weak
.
<EOS>
I
shall
pray
for
you
hourly
.
 
<EOS>
Yours
,
ST
.
JOHN
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
spirit
,
"
I
answered
mentally
,
"
is
willing
to
do
what
is
right
;
and
my
flesh
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
is
strong
enough
to
accomplish
the
will
of
Heaven
,
when
once
that
will
is
distinctly
known
to
me
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
it
shall
be
strong
enough
to
search
 
inquire
 
to
grope
an
outlet
from
this
cloud
of
doubt
,
and
find
the
open
day
of
certainty
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
of
June
;
yet
the
morning
was
overcast
and
chilly
<EOS>
:
rain
beat
fast
on
my
casement
.
<EOS>
I
heard
the
front
-
door
open
,
and
St.
John
pass
out
.
<EOS>
Looking
through
the
window
,
I
saw
him
traverse
the
garden
.
<EOS>
He
took
the
way
over
the
misty
moors
in
the
direction
of
Whitcross
 
there
he
would
meet
the
coach
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
a
few
more
hours
I
shall
succeed
you
in
that
track
,
cousin
,
"
thought
I
:
"
I
too
have
a
coach
to
meet
at
Whitcross
.
<EOS>
I
too
have
some
to
see
and
ask
after
in
England
,
before
I
depart
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
wanted
yet
two
hours
of
breakfast
-
time
.
<EOS>
I
filled
the
interval
in
walking
softly
about
my
room
,
and
pondering
the
visitation
which
had
given
my
plans
their
present
bent
.
<EOS>
I
recalled
that
inward
sensation
I
had
experienced
:
for
I
could
recall
it
,
with
all
its
unspeakable
strangeness
.
<EOS>
I
recalled
the
voice
I
had
heard
;
again
I
questioned
whence
<EOS>
it
came
,
as
vainly
as
before
:
it
seemed
in
_
me
_
 
not
in
the
external
world
.
<EOS>
I
asked
was
it
a
mere
nervous
impression
 
<EOS>
a
delusion
?
<EOS>
I
could
not
conceive
or
believe
:
it
was
more
like
an
inspiration
.
<EOS>
The
wondrous
shock
of
feeling
had
come
like
the
earthquake
which
shook
the
foundations
of
Paul
and
Silas
's
prison
;
it
had
opened
the
doors
of
the
soul
's
cell
and
loosed
its
bands
 
<EOS>
it
had
wakened
it
out
of
its
sleep
,
whence
it
sprang
<EOS>
trembling
,
listening
,
aghast
<EOS>
;
then
vibrated
thrice
a
cry
on
my
startled
ear
,
and
in
my
quaking
heart
and
through
my
spirit
,
which
neither
feared
nor
shook
,
but
exulted
as
if
in
joy
over
the
success
of
one
effort
it
had
been
privileged
to
make
,
independent
of
the
cumbrous
body
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ere
many
days
,
"
I
said
,
as
I
terminated
my
musings
,
"
I
will
know
something
of
him
whose
voice
seemed
last
night
to
summon
me
.
<EOS>
Letters
have
proved
of
no
avail
 
personal
inquiry
shall
replace
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
breakfast
I
announced
to
Diana
and
Mary
that
I
was
going
a
journey
,
and
should
be
absent
at
least
four
days
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alone
,
Jane
?
"
they
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
it
was
to
see
or
hear
news
of
a
friend
about
whom
I
had
<EOS>
for
some
time
been
uneasy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
might
have
said
,
as
I
have
no
doubt
they
thought
,
that
they
had
believed
me
to
be
without
any
friends
save
them
:
for
,
indeed
,
I
had
often
said
so
;
but
,
with
their
true
natural
delicacy
,
they
abstained
from
comment
,
except
that
Diana
asked
me
if
I
was
sure
I
was
well
enough
to
travel
.
<EOS>
I
looked
very
pale
,
she
observed
.
<EOS>
I
replied
,
that
nothing
ailed
me
save
anxiety
of
mind
,
<EOS>
which
I
hoped
soon
to
alleviate
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
easy
to
make
my
further
arrangements
;
for
I
was
troubled
with
no
inquiries
 
no
surmises
.
<EOS>
Having
once
explained
to
them
that
I
could
not
now
be
explicit
about
my
plans
,
they
kindly
and
wisely
acquiesced
in
the
silence
with
which
I
pursued
them
,
according
to
me
the
privilege
of
free
action
I
should
under
similar
circumstances
have
accorded
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
left
Moor
House
at
three
o'clock
p.m.
,
and
soon
after
four
I
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
sign
-
post
of
Whitcross
,
waiting
the
arrival
of
the
coach
which
was
to
take
me
to
distant
Thornfield
.
<EOS>
Amidst
the
silence
of
those
solitary
roads
and
desert
hills
,
I
heard
it
approach
from
a
great
distance
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
same
vehicle
whence
,
a
year
ago
,
I
had
alighted
one
summer
evening
on
this
very
spot
 
<EOS>
how
desolate
,
and
hopeless
,
and
objectless
!
<EOS>
It
stopped
as
I
beckoned
.
<EOS>
I
entered
 
not
now
obliged
to
part
with
my
whole
fortune
as
the
price
of
its
accommodation
.
<EOS>
Once
more
on
the
road
to
Thornfield
,
I
felt
like
the
messenger
-
pigeon
flying
home
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
journey
of
six
-
and
-
thirty
hours
.
<EOS>
I
had
set
out
from
Whitcross
on
a
Tuesday
afternoon
,
and
early
on
the
succeeding
Thursday
morning
the
coach
stopped
to
water
the
horses
at
a
wayside
inn
,
situated
in
the
midst
of
scenery
whose
green
hedges
and
large
fields
and
low
pastoral
hills
(
how
mild
of
feature
and
verdant
of
hue
compared
with
the
stern
North-
Midland
moors
of
Morton
!
)
<EOS>
met
my
eye
like
the
lineaments
of
a
once
familiar
face
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
knew
the
character
of
this
landscape
:
<EOS>
I
was
sure
we
were
near
my
bourne
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
far
is
Thornfield
Hall
from
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
of
the
ostler
.
  
<EOS>
"
Just
two
miles
,
ma'am
,
across
the
fields
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
journey
is
closed
,
"
I
thought
to
myself
.
<EOS>
I
got
out
of
the
coach
,
gave
a
box
I
had
into
the
ostler
's
charge
,
to
be
kept
till
I
called
for
it
;
paid
my
fare
;
satisfied
the
coachman
,
and
was
going
:
<EOS>
the
brightening
day
gleamed
on
the
sign
of
the
inn
,
and
I
read
in
gilt
letters
,
"
The
Rochester
Arms
.
<EOS>
"
My
heart
leapt
up
:
I
was
already
on
my
master
's
very
lands
.
<EOS>
It
fell
again
:
<EOS>
the
thought
struck
it
:
    
<EOS>
"
Your
master
himself
may
be
beyond
the
British
Channel
,
for
aught
you
know
:
<EOS>
and
then
,
if
he
is
at
Thornfield
Hall
,
towards
which
you
hasten
,
who
besides
him
is
there
?
<EOS>
His
lunatic
wife
:
<EOS>
and
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
<EOS>
:
you
dare
not
speak
to
him
or
seek
his
presence
.
<EOS>
You
have
lost
your
labour
 
<EOS>
you
had
better
go
no
farther
,
"
urged
the
monitor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ask
information
of
the
people
at
the
inn
;
they
can
give
you
all
you
seek
:
they
can
solve
your
doubts
at
once
.
<EOS>
Go
up
to
that
man
,
and
inquire
if
Mr.
Rochester
be
at
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
suggestion
was
sensible
,
and
yet
I
could
not
force
myself
to
act
on
it
.
<EOS>
I
so
dreaded
a
reply
that
would
crush
me
with
despair
.
<EOS>
To
prolong
doubt
was
to
prolong
hope
.
<EOS>
I
might
yet
once
more
see
the
Hall
under
the
ray
of
her
star
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
stile
before
me
 
the
very
fields
through
which
I
had
hurried
,
blind
,
deaf
,
distracted
with
a
revengeful
fury
tracking
and
scourging
me
,
on
the
morning
I
fled
from
Thornfield
:
ere
<EOS>
I
well
knew
what
course
I
had
resolved
to
take
<EOS>
,
I
was
in
the
midst
of
them
.
<EOS>
How
fast
I
walked
!
<EOS>
How
I
ran
sometimes
!
<EOS>
How
I
looked
forward
to
catch
the
first
view
of
the
well
-
known
woods
!
<EOS>
With
what
feelings
I
welcomed
single
trees
I
knew
,
and
familiar
glimpses
of
meadow
and
hill
between
them
!
  
<EOS>
At
last
the
woods
rose
;
the
rookery
clustered
dark
;
a
loud
cawing
broke
the
morning
stillness
.
<EOS>
Strange
delight
inspired
me
:
on
I
hastened
.
<EOS>
Another
field
crossed
 
a
lane
threaded
 
<EOS>
and
there
were
the
courtyard
walls
 
<EOS>
the
back
offices
:
<EOS>
the
house
itself
,
the
rookery
still
hid
.
<EOS>
"
My
first
view
of
it
shall
be
in
front
,
"
I
determined
,
"
where
its
bold
battlements
will
strike
the
eye
nobly
at
once
,
and
where
I
can
single
out
my
master
's
very
window
:
perhaps
he
will
be
standing
at
it
 
<EOS>
he
rises
early
:
perhaps
he
is
now
walking
in
the
orchard
,
or
on
the
pavement
in
front
.
<EOS>
Could
<EOS>
I
but
see
him
!
 
<EOS>
but
a
moment
!
<EOS>
Surely
,
in
that
case
,
I
should
not
be
so
mad
as
to
run
to
him
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
 
I
am
not
certain
.
<EOS>
And
if
I
did
 
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
God
bless
him
!
<EOS>
What
then
?
<EOS>
Who
would
be
hurt
by
my
once
more
tasting
the
life
his
glance
can
give
me
?
<EOS>
I
rave
:
perhaps
at
this
moment
he
is
watching
the
sun
rise
over
the
Pyrenees
,
or
on
the
tideless
sea
of
the
south
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
coasted
along
the
lower
wall
of
the
orchard
 
turned
its
angle
:
there
was
a
gate
just
there
,
opening
into
the
meadow
,
between
two
stone
pillars
crowned
by
stone
balls
.
<EOS>
From
behind
one
pillar
I
could
peep
round
quietly
at
the
full
front
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
I
advanced
my
head
with
precaution
,
desirous
to
ascertain
if
any
bedroom
window
-
blinds
were
yet
drawn
up
:
battlements
,
windows
,
long
front
 
all
from
this
sheltered
station
were
at
my
command
.
  
<EOS>
The
crows
sailing
overhead
perhaps
watched
me
while
I
took
this
survey
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
they
thought
.
<EOS>
They
must
have
considered
I
was
very
careful
and
timid
at
first
,
and
that
gradually
I
grew
very
bold
and
reckless
.
<EOS>
A
peep
,
and
then
a
long
stare
;
and
then
a
departure
from
my
niche
and
a
straying
out
into
the
meadow
;
and
a
sudden
stop
full
in
front
of
the
great
mansion
,
and
a
protracted
,
hardy
gaze
towards
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
affectation
of
diffidence
was
this
at
first
?
<EOS>
"
they
might
have
demanded
;
"
what
stupid
regardlessness
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hear
an
illustration
,
reader
.
  
<EOS>
A
lover
finds
his
mistress
asleep
on
a
mossy
bank
;
he
wishes
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
fair
face
without
waking
her
.
<EOS>
He
steals
softly
over
the
grass
,
careful
to
make
no
sound
;
he
pauses
 
fancying
she
has
stirred
:
he
withdraws
:
not
for
worlds
would
he
be
seen
.
<EOS>
All
is
still
:
he
again
advances
:
he
bends
above
her
;
a
light
veil
rests
on
her
features
<EOS>
:
he
lifts
it
,
bends
lower
;
now
his
eyes
anticipate
the
vision
of
beauty
 
warm
,
and
blooming
,
and
lovely
,
in
rest
.
<EOS>
How
hurried
was
their
first
glance
!
<EOS>
But
how
they
fix
!
<EOS>
How
he
starts
!
<EOS>
How
he
suddenly
and
vehemently
clasps
in
both
arms
the
form
he
dared
not
,
a
moment
since
,
touch
with
his
finger
!
<EOS>
How
he
calls
aloud
a
name
,
and
drops
his
burden
,
and
gazes
on
it
wildly
!
<EOS>
He
thus
grasps
and
cries
,
and
gazes
,
because
he
no
longer
fears
to
waken
by
any
sound
he
can
utter
 
by
any
movement
he
can
make
.
<EOS>
He
thought
his
love
slept
sweetly
:
he
finds
she
is
stone
dead
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
with
timorous
joy
towards
a
stately
house
:
I
saw
a
blackened
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
No
need
to
cower
behind
a
gate
-
post
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
to
peep
up
at
chamber
lattices
,
fearing
life
was
astir
behind
them
!
<EOS>
No
need
to
listen
for
doors
opening
 
to
fancy
steps
on
the
pavement
or
the
gravel
-
walk
!
<EOS>
The
lawn
,
the
grounds
were
trodden
and
waste
:
the
portal
yawned
void
.
<EOS>
The
front
was
,
as
I
had
once
seen
it
in
a
dream
,
but
a
well
-
like
wall
,
very
high
and
very
fragile
-
looking
,
perforated
with
paneless
windows
:
no
roof
,
no
battlements
,
no
chimneys
 
<EOS>
all
had
crashed
in
.
  
<EOS>
And
there
was
the
silence
of
death
about
it
:
<EOS>
the
solitude
of
a
lonesome
wild
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
that
letters
addressed
to
people
here
had
never
received
an
answer
:
as
well
despatch
epistles
to
a
vault
in
a
church
aisle
.
<EOS>
The
grim
blackness
of
the
stones
told
by
what
fate
<EOS>
the
Hall
had
fallen
 
by
conflagration
:
but
how
kindled
?
<EOS>
What
story
belonged
to
this
disaster
?
<EOS>
What
loss
,
besides
mortar
and
marble
and
wood
-
work
had
followed
upon
it
?
<EOS>
Had
life
been
wrecked
as
well
as
property
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
whose
?
<EOS>
Dreadful
question
<EOS>
:
there
was
no
one
here
to
answer
it
 
not
even
dumb
sign
,
mute
token
.
  
<EOS>
In
wandering
round
the
shattered
walls
and
through
the
devastated
interior
,
I
gathered
evidence
that
the
calamity
was
not
of
late
occurrence
.
<EOS>
Winter
snows
,
I
thought
,
had
drifted
through
that
void
arch
,
winter
rains
beaten
in
at
those
hollow
casements
;
for
,
amidst
the
drenched
piles
of
rubbish
,
spring
had
cherished
vegetation
:
grass
and
weed
grew
here
and
there
between
the
stones
and
fallen
rafters
.
<EOS>
And
oh
!
<EOS>
where
meantime
was
the
hapless
owner
of
this
wreck
?
<EOS>
In
what
land
?
<EOS>
Under
what
auspices
?
<EOS>
My
eye
involuntarily
wandered
to
the
grey
church
tower
near
the
gates
,
and
I
asked
,
"
Is
he
with
Damer
de
Rochester
,
sharing
the
shelter
of
his
narrow
marble
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Some
answer
must
be
had
to
these
questions
.
<EOS>
I
could
find
it
nowhere
but
at
the
inn
,
and
thither
,
ere
long
,
I
returned
.
<EOS>
The
host
himself
brought
my
breakfast
into
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
I
requested
him
to
shut
the
door
and
sit
down
:
I
had
some
questions
to
ask
him
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
complied
,
I
scarcely
knew
how
to
begin
;
such
horror
had
I
of
the
possible
answers
.
<EOS>
And
yet
the
spectacle
of
desolation
I
had
just
left
prepared
me
in
a
measure
for
a
tale
of
misery
.
<EOS>
The
host
was
a
respectable
-
looking
,
middle
-
aged
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
Thornfield
Hall
,
of
course
?
<EOS>
"
I
managed
to
say
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
;
I
lived
there
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
?
"
<EOS>
Not
in
my
time
,
I
thought
:
you
are
a
stranger
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
the
late
Mr.
Rochester
's
butler
,
"
he
added
.
  
<EOS>
The
late
!
<EOS>
I
seem
to
have
received
,
with
full
force
,
the
blow
I
had
been
trying
to
evade
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
late
!
<EOS>
"
I
gasped
.
<EOS>
"
Is
he
dead
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
the
present
gentleman
,
Mr.
Edward
's
father
,
"
he
explained
.
<EOS>
I
breathed
again
:
my
blood
resumed
its
flow
.
<EOS>
Fully
assured
by
these
words
that
Mr.
Edward
 
_
my
_
Mr.
Rochester
(
God
bless
him
,
wherever
he
was
!
)
 
<EOS>
was
at
least
alive
:
was
,
in
short
,
"
the
present
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
Gladdening
words
!
<EOS>
It
seemed
I
could
hear
all
that
was
to
come
 
<EOS>
whatever
the
disclosures
might
be
 
with
comparative
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
Since
he
was
not
in
the
grave
,
I
could
bear
,
I
thought
,
to
learn
that
he
was
at
the
Antipodes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr.
Rochester
living
at
Thornfield
Hall
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
knowing
,
of
course
,
what
the
answer
would
be
,
but
yet
desirous
of
deferring
the
direct
question
as
to
where
he
really
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
ma'am
 
<EOS>
oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
No
one
is
living
there
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
are
a
stranger
in
these
parts
,
or
you
would
have
heard
what
happened
last
autumn
,
 
Thornfield
Hall
is
quite
a
ruin
:
it
was
burnt
down
just
about
harvest
-
time
.
<EOS>
A
dreadful
calamity
!
<EOS>
such
an
immense
quantity
of
valuable
property
destroyed
:
hardly
any
of
the
furniture
could
be
saved
.
<EOS>
The
fire
broke
out
at
dead
of
night
,
and
before
the
engines
arrived
from
Millcote
,
the
building
was
one
mass
of
flame
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
terrible
spectacle
:
I
witnessed
it
myself
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
At
dead
of
night
!
<EOS>
"
I
muttered
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
that
was
ever
the
hour
of
fatality
at
Thornfield
.
<EOS>
"
Was
it
known
how
it
originated
?
<EOS>
"
I
demanded
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
guessed
,
ma'am
:
they
guessed
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
should
say
it
was
ascertained
beyond
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
perhaps
aware
,
"
he
continued
,
edging
his
chair
a
little
nearer
the
table
,
and
speaking
low
,
"
that
there
was
a
lady
 
aa
lunatic
,
kept
in
the
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
something
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
kept
in
very
close
confinement
,
ma'am
:
<EOS>
people
even
for
some
years
was
not
absolutely
certain
of
her
existence
.
<EOS>
No
one
saw
her
:
they
only
knew
by
rumour
that
such
a
person
was
at
the
Hall
;
and
who
or
what
she
was
it
was
difficult
to
conjecture
.
<EOS>
They
said
Mr.
Edward
had
brought
her
from
abroad
,
and
some
believed
she
had
been
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
But
a
queer
thing
happened
a
year
since
 
a
very
queer
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
feared
now
to
hear
my
own
story
.
<EOS>
I
endeavoured
to
recall
him
to
the
main
fact
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
this
lady
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
lady
,
ma'am
,
"
he
answered
,
"
turned
out
to
be
Mr.
Rochester
's
wife
!
<EOS>
The
discovery
was
brought
about
in
the
strangest
way
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
young
lady
,
a
governess
at
the
Hall
,
that
Mr.
Rochester
fell
in
 
"
  
"
But
the
fire
,
"
I
suggested
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
coming
to
that
,
ma'am
 
that
Mr.
Edward
fell
in
love
with
.
<EOS>
The
servants
say
they
never
saw
anybody
so
much
in
love
as
he
was
:
he
was
after
her
continually
.
<EOS>
They
used
to
watch
him
 
servants
will
,
you
know
,
ma'am
 
<EOS>
and
he
set
store
on
her
past
everything
:
for
all
,
nobody
but
him
thought
her
so
very
handsome
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
little
small
thing
,
they
say
,
almost
like
a
child
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
her
myself
;
but
I
've
heard
Leah
,
the
house
-
maid
,
tell
of
her
.
<EOS>
Leah
liked
her
well
enough
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
was
about
forty
,
and
this
governess
not
twenty
;
and
you
see
,
when
gentlemen
of
his
age
fall
in
love
with
girls
,
they
are
often
like
as
if
they
were
bewitched
.
<EOS>
Well
,
he
would
marry
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
tell
me
this
part
of
the
story
another
time
,
"
I
said
;
"
but
now
I
have
a
particular
reason
for
wishing
to
hear
all
about
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Was
it
suspected
that
this
lunatic
,
Mrs.
Rochester
,
had
any
hand
in
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
hit
it
,
ma'am
:
<EOS>
it
's
quite
certain
that
it
was
her
,
and
nobody
but
her
,
that
set
it
going
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
woman
to
take
care
of
her
called
Mrs.
Poole
 
an
able
woman
in
her
line
,
and
very
trustworthy
,
but
for
one
fault
 
a
fault
common
to
a
deal
of
them
nurses
and
matrons
 
<EOS>
she
_
kept
a
private
bottle
of
gin
by
her
_
,
and
now
and
then
took
a
drop
over
-
much
.
<EOS>
It
is
excusable
,
for
she
had
a
hard
life
of
it
:
but
still
it
was
dangerous
;
for
when
Mrs.
Poole
was
fast
asleep
after
the
gin
and
water
,
the
mad
lady
,
who
was
as
cunning
as
a
witch
,
would
take
the
keys
out
of
her
pocket
,
let
herself
out
of
her
chamber
,
and
go
roaming
about
the
house
,
doing
any
wild
mischief
that
came
into
her
head
.
<EOS>
They
say
she
had
nearly
burnt
her
husband
in
his
bed
once
:
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
know
about
that
.
<EOS>
However
,
on
this
night
,
she
set
fire
first
to
the
hangings
of
the
room
next
her
own
,
and
then
she
got
down
to
a
lower
storey
,
and
made
her
way
to
the
chamber
that
had
been
the
governess
's
 
<EOS>
(
she
was
like
as
if
she
knew
somehow
how
matters
had
gone
on
,
and
had
a
spite
at
her
)
 
<EOS>
and
she
kindled
the
bed
there
;
but
there
was
nobody
sleeping
in
it
,
fortunately
.
<EOS>
The
governess
had
run
away
two
months
before
;
and
for
all
Mr.
Rochester
sought
her
as
if
she
had
been
the
most
precious
thing
he
had
in
the
world
,
he
never
could
hear
a
word
of
her
;
and
he
grew
savage
 
<EOS>
quite
savage
on
his
disappointment
<EOS>
:
he
never
was
a
wild
man
,
but
he
got
dangerous
after
he
lost
her
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
alone
,
too
.
<EOS>
He
sent
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
the
housekeeper
,
away
to
her
friends
at
a
distance
;
but
he
did
it
handsomely
,
for
he
settled
an
annuity
on
her
for
life
:
and
she
deserved
it
 
<EOS>
she
was
a
very
good
woman
.
<EOS>
Miss
Adele
,
a
ward
he
had
,
was
put
to
school
.
<EOS>
He
broke
off
acquaintance
with
all
the
gentry
,
and
shut
himself
up
like
a
hermit
at
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
did
he
not
leave
England
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
England
?
<EOS>
Bless
you
,
no
!
<EOS>
He
would
not
cross
the
door
-
stones
of
the
house
,
except
at
night
,
when
he
walked
just
like
a
ghost
about
the
grounds
and
in
the
orchard
as
if
he
had
lost
his
senses
 
<EOS>
which
it
is
my
opinion
he
had
;
for
a
more
spirited
,
bolder
,
keener
gentleman
than
he
was
before
that
midge
of
a
governess
crossed
him
,
you
never
saw
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
man
given
to
wine
,
or
cards
,
or
racing
,
as
some
are
,
and
he
was
not
so
very
handsome
;
but
he
had
a
courage
and
a
will
of
his
own
,
if
ever
man
had
.
<EOS>
I
knew
him
from
a
boy
,
you
see
:
and
for
my
part
,
I
have
often
wished
that
Miss
Eyre
had
been
sunk
in
the
sea
before
she
came
to
Thornfield
Hall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
Mr.
Rochester
was
at
home
when
the
fire
broke
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
was
he
;
and
he
went
up
to
the
attics
when
all
was
burning
above
and
below
,
and
got
the
servants
out
of
their
beds
and
helped
them
down
himself
,
and
went
back
to
get
his
mad
wife
out
of
her
cell
.
<EOS>
And
then
they
called
out
to
him
that
she
was
on
the
roof
,
where
she
was
standing
,
waving
her
arms
,
above
the
battlements
,
and
shouting
out
till
they
could
hear
her
a
mile
off
:
<EOS>
I
saw
her
and
heard
her
with
my
own
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
big
woman
,
and
had
long
black
hair
:
we
could
see
it
streaming
against
the
flames
as
she
stood
.
<EOS>
I
witnessed
,
and
several
more
witnessed
,
Mr.
Rochester
ascend
through
the
sky
-
light
on
to
the
roof
;
we
heard
him
call
"
Bertha
!
<EOS>
"
We
saw
him
approach
her
;
and
then
,
ma'am
,
she
yelled
and
gave
a
spring
,
and
the
next
minute
she
lay
smashed
on
the
pavement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
{
The
next
minute
she
lay
smashed
on
the
pavement

"
Dead
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dead
!
<EOS>
Ay
,
dead
as
the
stones
on
which
her
brains
and
blood
were
scattered
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
God
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
well
say
so
,
ma'am
:
<EOS>
it
was
frightful
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
shuddered
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
afterwards
?
<EOS>
"
I
urged
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
afterwards
the
house
was
burnt
to
the
ground
:
there
are
only
some
bits
of
walls
standing
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Were
any
other
lives
lost
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
 
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
if
there
had
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Mr.
Edward
!
"
<EOS>
he
ejaculated
,
"
I
little
thought
ever
to
have
seen
it
!
<EOS>
Some
say
it
was
a
just
judgment
on
him
for
keeping
his
first
marriage
secret
,
and
wanting
to
take
another
wife
while
he
had
one
living
:
<EOS>
but
I
pity
him
,
for
my
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
said
he
was
alive
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
:
he
is
alive
;
but
many
think
he
had
better
be
dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
How
?
<EOS>
"
My
blood
was
again
running
cold
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
<EOS>
"
I
demanded
.
<EOS>
"
Is
he
in
England
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
 
<EOS>
ay
 
<EOS>
he
's
in
England
;
he
ca
n't
get
out
of
England
<EOS>
,
I
fancy
 
<EOS>
he
's
a
fixture
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
agony
was
this
!
<EOS>
And
the
man
seemed
resolved
to
protract
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
stone
-
blind
,
"
he
said
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
is
stone
-
blind
,
is
Mr.
Edward
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
dreaded
worse
.
<EOS>
I
had
dreaded
he
was
mad
.
<EOS>
I
summoned
strength
to
ask
what
had
caused
this
calamity
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
all
his
own
courage
,
and
a
body
may
say
,
his
kindness
,
in
a
way
,
ma'am
:
he
would
n't
leave
the
house
till
every
one
else
was
out
before
him
.
<EOS>
As
he
came
down
the
great
staircase
at
last
,
after
Mrs.
Rochester
had
flung
herself
from
the
battlements
,
there
was
a
great
crash
 
<EOS>
all
fell
.
<EOS>
He
was
taken
out
from
under
the
ruins
,
alive
,
but
sadly
hurt
:
a
beam
had
fallen
in
such
a
way
as
to
protect
him
partly
;
but
one
eye
was
knocked
out
,
and
one
hand
so
crushed
that
Mr.
Carter
,
the
surgeon
,
had
to
amputate
it
directly
.
<EOS>
The
other
eye
inflamed
:
he
lost
the
sight
of
that
also
.
<EOS>
He
is
now
helpless
,
indeed
 
blind
and
a
cripple
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
<EOS>
Where
does
he
now
live
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
Ferndean
,
a
manor
-
house
on
a
farm
he
has
,
about
thirty
miles
off
:
quite
a
desolate
spot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
with
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Old
John
and
his
wife
:
he
would
have
none
else
.
<EOS>
He
is
quite
broken
down
,
they
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
any
sort
of
conveyance
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
a
chaise
,
ma'am
,
a
very
handsome
chaise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
it
be
got
ready
instantly
;
and
if
your
post
-
boy
can
drive
me
to
Ferndean
before
dark
this
day
,
I
'll
pay
both
you
and
him
twice
the
hire
you
usually
demand
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
manor
-
house
of
Ferndean
was
a
building
of
considerable
antiquity
,
moderate
size
,
and
no
architectural
pretensions
,
deep
buried
in
a
wood
.
<EOS>
I
had
heard
of
it
before
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
often
spoke
of
it
,
and
sometimes
went
there
.
<EOS>
His
father
had
purchased
the
estate
for
the
sake
of
the
game
covers
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
let
the
house
,
but
could
find
no
tenant
,
in
consequence
of
its
ineligible
and
insalubrious
site
.
<EOS>
Ferndean
then
remained
uninhabited
and
unfurnished
,
with
the
exception
of
some
two
or
three
rooms
fitted
up
for
the
accommodation
of
the
squire
when
he
went
there
in
the
season
to
shoot
.
  
<EOS>
To
this
house
I
came
just
ere
dark
on
an
evening
marked
by
the
characteristics
of
sad
sky
,
cold
gale
,
and
continued
small
penetrating
rain
.
<EOS>
The
last
mile
I
performed
on
foot
,
having
dismissed
the
chaise
and
driver
with
the
double
remuneration
I
had
promised
.
<EOS>
Even
when
within
a
very
short
distance
of
the
manor
-
house
,
you
could
see
nothing
of
it
,
so
thick
and
dark
grew
the
timber
of
the
gloomy
wood
about
it
.
<EOS>
Iron
gates
between
granite
pillars
showed
me
where
to
enter
,
and
passing
through
them
,
I
found
myself
at
once
in
the
twilight
of
close
-
ranked
trees
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
grass
-
grown
track
descending
the
forest
aisle
between
hoar
and
knotty
shafts
and
under
branched
arches
.
<EOS>
I
followed
it
,
expecting
soon
to
reach
the
dwelling
;
but
it
stretched
on
and
on
,
it
wound
far
and
farther
:
<EOS>
no
sign
of
habitation
or
grounds
was
visible
.
  
<EOS>
I
thought
I
had
taken
a
wrong
direction
and
lost
my
way
.
<EOS>
The
darkness
of
natural
as
well
as
of
sylvan
dusk
gathered
over
me
.
<EOS>
I
looked
round
in
search
of
another
road
.
<EOS>
There
was
none
:
all
was
interwoven
stem
,
columnar
trunk
,
dense
summer
foliage
 
<EOS>
no
opening
anywhere
.
  
<EOS>
I
proceeded
:
<EOS>
at
last
my
way
opened
,
the
trees
thinned
a
little
;
presently
I
beheld
a
railing
,
then
the
house
 
scarce
,
by
this
dim
light
,
distinguishable
from
the
trees
;
so
dank
and
green
were
its
decaying
walls
.
<EOS>
Entering
a
portal
,
fastened
only
by
a
latch
,
I
stood
amidst
a
space
of
enclosed
ground
,
from
which
the
wood
swept
away
in
a
semicircle
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
flowers
,
no
garden
-
beds
;
only
a
broad
gravel
-
walk
girdling
a
grass
-
plat
,
and
this
set
in
the
heavy
frame
of
the
forest
.
<EOS>
The
house
presented
two
pointed
gables
in
its
front
;
the
windows
were
latticed
and
narrow
<EOS>
:
the
front
door
was
narrow
too
,
one
step
led
up
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
whole
looked
,
as
the
host
of
the
Rochester
Arms
had
said
,
"
quite
a
desolate
spot
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
as
still
as
a
church
on
a
week
-
day
:
the
pattering
rain
on
the
forest
leaves
was
the
only
sound
audible
in
its
vicinage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
there
be
life
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
life
of
some
kind
there
was
;
for
I
heard
a
movement
 
<EOS>
that
narrow
front
-
door
was
unclosing
,
and
some
shape
was
about
to
issue
from
the
grange
.
  
<EOS>
It
opened
slowly
:
a
figure
came
out
into
the
twilight
and
stood
on
the
step
;
a
man
without
a
hat
:
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
as
if
to
feel
whether
it
rained
.
<EOS>
Dusk
as
it
was
<EOS>
,
I
had
recognised
him
 
<EOS>
it
was
my
master
,
Edward
Fairfax
Rochester
,
and
no
other
.
  
<EOS>
I
stayed
my
step
,
almost
my
breath
,
and
stood
to
watch
him
 
to
examine
him
,
myself
unseen
,
and
alas
!
<EOS>
to
him
invisible
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
sudden
meeting
,
and
one
in
which
rapture
was
kept
well
in
check
by
pain
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
difficulty
in
restraining
my
voice
from
exclamation
,
my
step
from
hasty
advance
.
  
<EOS>
His
form
was
of
the
same
strong
and
stalwart
contour
as
ever
:
his
port
was
still
erect
,
his
hair
was
still
raven
black
;
nor
were
his
features
altered
or
sunk
:
not
in
one
year
's
space
,
by
any
sorrow
,
could
his
athletic
strength
be
quelled
or
his
vigorous
prime
blighted
.
<EOS>
But
in
his
countenance
I
saw
a
change
:
that
looked
desperate
and
brooding
 
that
reminded
me
of
some
wronged
and
fettered
wild
beast
or
bird
,
dangerous
to
approach
in
his
sullen
woe
.
<EOS>
The
caged
eagle
,
whose
gold
-
ringed
eyes
cruelty
has
extinguished
,
might
look
as
looked
that
sightless
Samson
.
  
<EOS>
And
,
reader
,
do
you
think
I
feared
him
in
his
blind
ferocity
?
 
<EOS>
if
you
do
,
you
little
know
me
.
<EOS>
A
soft
hope
blest
with
my
sorrow
that
soon
I
should
dare
to
drop
a
kiss
on
that
brow
of
rock
,
and
on
those
lips
so
sternly
sealed
beneath
it
:
but
not
yet
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
accost
him
yet
.
  
<EOS>
He
descended
the
one
step
,
and
advanced
slowly
and
gropingly
towards
the
grass
-
plat
.
<EOS>
Where
was
his
daring
stride
now
?
<EOS>
Then
he
paused
,
as
if
he
knew
not
which
way
to
turn
.
<EOS>
He
lifted
his
hand
and
opened
his
eyelids
;
gazed
blank
,
and
with
a
straining
effort
,
on
the
sky
,
and
toward
the
amphitheatre
of
trees
:
<EOS>
one
saw
that
all
to
him
was
void
darkness
.
<EOS>
He
stretched
his
right
hand
(
the
left
arm
,
the
mutilated
one
,
he
kept
hidden
in
his
bosom
)
;
he
seemed
to
wish
by
touch
to
gain
an
idea
of
what
lay
around
him
:
he
met
but
vacancy
still
;
for
the
trees
were
some
yards
off
where
he
stood
.
<EOS>
He
relinquished
the
endeavour
,
folded
his
arms
,
and
stood
quiet
and
mute
in
the
rain
,
now
falling
fast
on
his
uncovered
head
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
John
approached
him
from
some
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
take
my
arm
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
;
"
there
is
a
heavy
shower
coming
on
:
had
you
not
better
go
in
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
alone
,
"
was
the
answer
.
  
<EOS>
John
withdrew
without
having
observed
me
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
now
tried
to
walk
about
:
vainly
,
 
all
was
too
uncertain
.
<EOS>
He
groped
his
way
back
to
the
house
,
and
,
re
-
entering
it
,
closed
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
drew
near
and
knocked
:
<EOS>
John
's
wife
opened
for
me
.
"
<EOS>
Mary
,
"
I
said
,
"
how
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
started
as
if
she
had
seen
a
ghost
:
I
calmed
her
.
<EOS>
To
her
hurried
<EOS>
"
Is
it
really
<EOS>
you
,
miss
,
come
at
this
late
hour
to
this
lonely
place
?
<EOS>
"
I
answered
by
taking
her
hand
;
and
then
I
followed
her
into
the
kitchen
,
where
John
now
sat
by
a
good
fire
.
<EOS>
I
explained
to
them
,
in
few
words
,
that
I
had
heard
all
which
had
happened
since
I
left
Thornfield
,
and
that
I
was
come
to
see
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
I
asked
John
to
go
down
to
the
turn-
pike
-
house
,
where
I
had
dismissed
the
chaise
,
and
bring
my
trunk
,
which
I
had
left
there
:
and
then
,
while
I
removed
my
bonnet
and
shawl
,
I
questioned
Mary
as
to
whether
I
could
be
accommodated
at
the
Manor
House
for
the
night
;
and
finding
that
arrangements
to
that
effect
,
though
difficult
,
would
not
be
impossible
<EOS>
,
I
informed
her
I
should
stay
.
<EOS>
Just
at
this
moment
the
parlour
-
bell
rang
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
go
in
,
"
said
I
,
"
tell
your
master
that
a
person
wishes
to
speak
to
him
,
but
do
not
give
my
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
he
will
see
you
,
"
she
answered
;
"
he
refuses
everybody
.
"
  
<EOS>
When
she
returned
,
I
inquired
what
he
had
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
to
send
in
your
name
and
your
business
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
She
then
proceeded
to
fill
a
glass
with
water
,
and
place
it
on
a
tray
,
together
with
candles
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
what
he
rang
for
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
:
he
always
has
candles
brought
in
at
dark
,
though
he
is
blind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
the
tray
to
me
;
I
will
carry
it
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
took
it
from
her
hand
:
she
pointed
me
out
the
parlour
door
.
<EOS>
The
tray
shook
as
I
held
it
;
the
water
spilt
from
the
glass
;
my
heart
struck
my
ribs
loud
and
fast
.
<EOS>
Mary
opened
the
door
for
me
,
and
shut
it
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
This
parlour
looked
gloomy
:
a
neglected
handful
of
fire
burnt
low
in
the
grate
;
and
,
leaning
over
it
,
with
his
head
supported
against
the
high
,
old
-
fashioned
mantelpiece
,
appeared
the
blind
tenant
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
His
old
dog
,
Pilot
,
lay
on
one
side
,
removed
out
of
the
way
,
and
coiled
up
as
if
afraid
of
being
inadvertently
trodden
upon
.
<EOS>
Pilot
pricked
up
his
ears
when
I
came
in
:
then
he
jumped
up
with
a
yelp
and
a
whine
,
and
bounded
towards
me
:
he
almost
knocked
the
tray
from
my
hands
.
<EOS>
I
set
it
on
the
table
;
then
patted
him
,
and
said
softly
,
"
Lie
down
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
turned
mechanically
to
_
see
_
what
the
commotion
was
:
but
as
he
_
saw
_
nothing
,
he
returned
and
sighed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
the
water
,
Mary
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
I
approached
him
with
the
now
only
half
-
filled
glass
;
Pilot
followed
me
,
still
excited
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Down
,
Pilot
!
<EOS>
"
I
again
said
.
<EOS>
He
checked
the
water
on
its
way
to
his
lips
,
and
seemed
to
listen
:
he
drank
,
and
put
the
glass
down
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
you
,
Mary
,
is
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
is
in
the
kitchen
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
He
put
out
his
hand
with
a
quick
gesture
,
but
not
seeing
where
I
stood
,
he
did
not
touch
me
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
this
?
<EOS>
Who
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
he
demanded
,
trying
,
as
it
seemed
,
to
_
see
_
with
those
sightless
eyes
 
unavailing
and
distressing
attempt
!
"
<EOS>
Answer
me
 
speak
again
!
"
<EOS>
he
ordered
,
imperiously
and
aloud
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
have
a
little
more
water
,
sir
?
<EOS>
I
spilt
half
of
what
was
in
the
glass
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
Who
_
is
it
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
What
_
is
it
?
<EOS>
Who
speaks
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pilot
knows
me
,
and
John
and
Mary
know
I
am
here
.
<EOS>
I
came
only
this
evening
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Great
God
!
 
<EOS>
what
delusion
has
come
over
me
?
<EOS>
What
sweet
madness
has
seized
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
delusion
 
<EOS>
no
madness
:
<EOS>
your
mind
,
sir
,
is
too
strong
for
delusion
,
your
health
too
sound
for
frenzy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
is
the
speaker
?
<EOS>
Is
it
only
a
voice
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
_
can
not
_
see
,
but
I
must
feel
,
or
my
heart
will
stop
and
my
brain
burst
.
<EOS>
Whatever
 
whoever
you
are
 
be
perceptible
to
the
touch
or
I
can
not
live
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
groped
;
I
arrested
his
wandering
hand
,
and
prisoned
it
in
both
mine
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
very
fingers
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
;
"
her
small
,
slight
fingers
!
<EOS>
If
so
there
must
be
more
of
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
muscular
hand
broke
from
my
custody
;
my
arm
was
seized
,
my
shoulder
 
neck
 
waist
 
I
was
entwined
and
gathered
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
Jane
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
What
_
is
it
?
<EOS>
This
is
her
shape
 
<EOS>
this
is
her
size
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
this
her
voice
,
"
I
added
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
all
here
:
her
heart
,
too
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
be
so
near
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
Eyre
!
 
<EOS>
Jane
Eyre
,
"
was
all
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
master
,
"
I
answered
,
"
I
am
Jane
Eyre
:
I
have
found
you
out
 
<EOS>
I
am
come
back
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
truth
?
 
in
the
flesh
?
<EOS>
My
living
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
touch
me
,
sir
,
 
you
hold
me
,
and
fast
enough
:
I
am
not
cold
like
a
corpse
,
nor
vacant
like
air
,
am
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
living
darling
!
<EOS>
These
are
certainly
her
limbs
,
and
these
her
features
;
but
I
can
not
be
so
blest
,
after
all
my
misery
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
dream
;
such
dreams
as
I
have
had
at
night
when
I
have
clasped
her
once
more
to
my
heart
,
as
I
do
now
;
and
kissed
her
,
as
thus
 
and
felt
that
she
loved
me
,
and
trusted
that
she
would
not
leave
me
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Which
I
never
will
,
sir
,
from
this
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
will
,
says
the
vision
?
<EOS>
But
I
always
woke
and
found
it
an
empty
mockery
;
and
I
was
desolate
and
abandoned
 
<EOS>
my
life
dark
,
lonely
,
<EOS>
hopeless
 
<EOS>
my
soul
athirst
and
forbidden
to
drink
 
my
heart
famished
and
never
to
be
fed
.
<EOS>
Gentle
,
soft
dream
,
nestling
in
my
arms
now
<EOS>
,
you
will
fly
,
too
,
as
your
sisters
have
all
fled
before
you
:
but
kiss
me
before
you
go
 
<EOS>
embrace
me
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
sir
 
and
there
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
I
pressed
my
lips
to
his
once
brilliant
and
now
rayless
<EOS>
eyes
 
<EOS>
I
swept
his
hair
from
his
brow
,
and
kissed
that
too
.
<EOS>
He
suddenly
seemed
to
arouse
himself
:
the
conviction
of
the
reality
of
all
this
seized
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
you
 
is
it
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
You
are
come
back
to
me
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
do
not
lie
dead
in
some
ditch
under
some
stream
?
<EOS>
And
you
are
not
a
pining
outcast
amongst
strangers
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I
am
an
independent
woman
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Independent
!
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
in
Madeira
is
dead
,
and
he
left
me
five
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
this
is
practical
 
<EOS>
this
is
real
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
:
"
I
should
never
dream
that
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
there
is
that
peculiar
voice
of
hers
,
so
animating
and
piquant
,
as
well
as
soft
:
it
cheers
my
withered
heart
;
it
puts
life
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
Janet
!
<EOS>
Are
you
an
independent
woman
?
<EOS>
A
rich
woman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
wo
n't
let
me
live
with
you
,
I
can
build
a
house
of
my
own
close
up
to
your
door
,
and
you
may
come
and
sit
in
my
parlour
when
you
want
company
of
an
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
as
you
are
rich
,
Jane
,
you
have
now
,
no
doubt
,
friends
who
will
look
after
you
,
and
not
suffer
you
to
devote
yourself
to
a
blind
lameter
like
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
I
am
independent
,
sir
,
as
well
as
rich
:
I
am
my
own
mistress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
stay
with
me
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Certainly
 
unless
you
object
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
your
neighbour
,
your
nurse
,
your
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
I
find
you
lonely
:
I
will
be
your
companion
 
to
read
to
you
,
to
walk
with
you
,
to
sit
with
you
,
to
wait
on
you
,
to
be
eyes
and
hands
to
you
.
<EOS>
Cease
to
look
so
melancholy
,
my
dear
master
<EOS>
;
you
shall
not
be
left
desolate
,
so
long
as
I
live
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
replied
not
:
he
seemed
serious
 
abstracted
<EOS>
;
he
sighed
;
he
half
-
opened
his
lips
as
if
to
speak
:
he
closed
them
again
.
<EOS>
I
felt
a
little
embarrassed
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
had
too
rashly
over
-
leaped
conventionalities
;
and
he
,
like
St.
John
,
saw
impropriety
in
my
inconsiderateness
.
<EOS>
I
had
indeed
made
my
proposal
from
the
idea
that
he
wished
and
would
ask
me
to
be
his
wife
:
an
expectation
,
not
the
less
certain
because
unexpressed
,
had
buoyed
me
up
,
that
he
would
claim
me
at
once
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
But
no
hint
to
that
effect
escaping
him
and
his
countenance
becoming
more
overcast
,
I
suddenly
remembered
that
I
might
have
been
all
wrong
,
and
was
perhaps
playing
the
fool
unwittingly
;
and
I
began
gently
to
withdraw
myself
from
his
arms
 
<EOS>
but
he
eagerly
snatched
me
closer
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
no
 
Jane
;
you
must
not
go
.
<EOS>
No
 
I
have
touched
you
,
heard
you
,
felt
the
comfort
of
your
presence
 
the
sweetness
of
your
consolation
:
I
can
not
give
up
these
joys
.
<EOS>
I
have
little
left
in
myself
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
you
.
<EOS>
The
world
may
laugh
 
may
call
me
absurd
,
selfish
 
<EOS>
but
it
does
not
signify
.
<EOS>
My
very
soul
demands
you
:
it
will
be
satisfied
,
or
it
will
take
deadly
vengeance
on
its
frame
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
I
will
stay
with
you
:
I
have
said
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
 
<EOS>
but
you
understand
one
thing
by
staying
with
me
;
and
I
understand
another
.
<EOS>
You
,
perhaps
,
could
make
up
your
mind
to
be
about
my
hand
and
chair
 
to
wait
on
me
as
a
kind
little
nurse
(
for
you
have
an
affectionate
heart
and
a
generous
spirit
,
which
prompt
you
to
make
sacrifices
for
those
you
pity
)
,
and
that
ought
to
suffice
for
me
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
should
now
entertain
none
but
fatherly
feelings
for
you
:
do
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
Come
 
tell
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
think
what
you
like
,
sir
:
I
am
content
to
be
only
your
nurse
,
if
you
think
it
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
can
not
always
be
my
nurse
,
Janet
<EOS>
:
you
are
young
 
<EOS>
you
must
marry
one
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
about
being
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
care
,
Janet
:
if
I
were
what
I
once
was
,
I
would
try
to
make
you
care
 
<EOS>
but
 
a
sightless
block
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
relapsed
again
into
gloom
.
<EOS>
I
,
on
the
contrary
,
became
more
cheerful
,
and
took
fresh
courage
:
these
last
words
gave
me
an
insight
as
to
where
the
difficulty
lay
;
and
as
it
was
no
difficulty
with
me
,
I
felt
quite
relieved
from
my
previous
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
I
resumed
a
livelier
vein
of
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
time
some
one
undertook
to
rehumanise
you
,
"
said
I
,
parting
his
thick
and
long
uncut
locks
;
"
for
I
see
you
are
being
metamorphosed
into
a
lion
,
or
something
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
"
faux
air
"
of
Nebuchadnezzar
in
the
fields
about
you
,
that
is
certain
:
your
hair
reminds
me
of
eagles
'
feathers
;
whether
your
nails
are
grown
like
birds
'
claws
or
not
,
I
have
not
yet
noticed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
this
arm
,
I
have
neither
hand
nor
nails
,
"
he
said
,
drawing
the
mutilated
limb
from
his
breast
,
and
showing
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
mere
stump
 
a
ghastly
sight
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
so
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
pity
to
see
it
;
and
a
pity
to
see
your
eyes
 
and
the
scar
of
fire
on
your
forehead
:
and
the
worst
of
it
is
,
one
is
in
danger
of
loving
you
too
well
for
all
this
;
and
making
too
much
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
would
be
revolted
,
Jane
,
when
you
saw
my
arm
,
and
my
cicatrised
visage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
tell
me
so
 
<EOS>
lest
I
should
say
something
disparaging
to
your
judgment
.
<EOS>
Now
,
let
me
leave
you
an
instant
,
to
make
a
better
fire
,
and
have
the
hearth
swept
up
.
<EOS>
Can
you
tell
when
there
is
a
good
fire
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
with
the
right
eye
I
see
a
glow
 
a
ruddy
haze
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
see
the
candles
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
dimly
 
each
is
a
luminous
cloud
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
see
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
fairy
:
<EOS>
but
I
am
only
too
thankful
to
hear
and
feel
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
do
you
take
supper
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
take
supper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
shall
have
some
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
I
am
hungry
:
so
are
you
,
I
daresay
,
<EOS>
only
you
forget
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Summoning
Mary
,
I
soon
had
the
room
in
more
cheerful
order
:
<EOS>
I
prepared
him
,
likewise
,
a
comfortable
repast
.
<EOS>
My
spirits
were
excited
,
and
with
pleasure
and
ease
I
talked
to
him
during
supper
,
and
for
a
long
time
after
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
harassing
restraint
,
no
repressing
of
glee
and
vivacity
with
him
;
for
with
him
I
was
at
perfect
ease
,
because
I
knew
I
suited
him
;
all
I
said
or
did
seemed
either
to
console
or
revive
him
.
<EOS>
Delightful
consciousness
!
<EOS>
It
brought
to
life
and
light
my
whole
nature
:
in
his
presence
I
thoroughly
lived
;
and
he
lived
in
mine
.
<EOS>
Blind
as
he
was
,
smiles
played
over
his
face
,
joy
dawned
on
his
forehead
:
his
lineaments
softened
and
warmed
.
  
<EOS>
After
supper
,
he
began
to
ask
me
many
questions
,
of
where
I
had
been
,
what
I
had
been
doing
<EOS>
,
how
I
had
found
him
out
;
but
I
gave
him
only
very
partial
replies
<EOS>
:
it
was
too
late
to
enter
into
particulars
that
night
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
wished
to
touch
no
deep
-
thrilling
chord
 
to
open
no
fresh
well
of
emotion
in
his
heart
:
my
sole
present
aim
was
to
cheer
him
.
<EOS>
Cheered
,
as
I
have
said
,
he
was
:
and
yet
<EOS>
but
by
fits
.
<EOS>
If
a
moment
's
silence
broke
the
conversation
,
he
would
turn
restless
,
touch
me
,
then
say
,
"
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
altogether
a
human
being
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
You
are
certain
of
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
{
You
are
altogether
a
human
being
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
You
are
certain
of
that
?
<EOS>

}
  
"
I
conscientiously
believe
so
,
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
how
,
on
this
dark
and
doleful
evening
,
could
you
so
suddenly
rise
on
my
lone
hearth
?
<EOS>
I
stretched
my
hand
to
take
a
glass
of
water
from
a
hireling
,
and
it
was
given
me
by
you
<EOS>
:
I
asked
a
question
,
expecting
John
's
wife
to
answer
me
,
and
your
voice
spoke
at
my
ear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
had
come
in
,
in
Mary
's
stead
,
with
the
tray
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
there
is
enchantment
in
the
very
hour
I
am
now
spending
with
you
.
<EOS>
Who
can
tell
what
a
dark
,
dreary
,
hopeless
life
I
have
dragged
on
for
months
past
?
<EOS>
Doing
nothing
,
expecting
nothing
;
merging
night
in
day
;
feeling
but
the
sensation
of
cold
when
I
let
the
fire
go
out
,
of
hunger
when
I
forgot
to
eat
:
and
then
a
ceaseless
sorrow
,
and
,
at
times
,
a
very
delirium
of
desire
to
behold
my
Jane
again
.
<EOS>
Yes
:
for
her
restoration
I
longed
,
far
more
than
for
that
of
my
lost
sight
.
<EOS>
How
can
it
be
that
Jane
is
with
me
,
and
says
she
loves
me
?
<EOS>
Will
she
not
depart
as
suddenly
as
she
came
?
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
,
I
fear
I
shall
find
her
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
commonplace
,
practical
reply
,
out
of
the
train
of
his
own
disturbed
ideas
,
was
,
I
was
sure
,
the
best
and
most
reassuring
for
him
in
this
frame
of
mind
.
<EOS>
I
passed
my
finger
over
his
eyebrows
,
and
remarked
that
they
were
scorched
,
and
that
I
would
apply
something
which
would
make
them
grow
as
broad
and
black
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
use
of
doing
me
good
in
any
way
,
beneficent
spirit
,
when
,
at
some
fatal
moment
,
you
will
again
desert
me
 
passing
like
a
shadow
,
whither
and
how
to
me
unknown
,
and
for
me
remaining
afterwards
undiscoverable
?
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
a
pocket
-
comb
about
you
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
for
,
Jane
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
to
comb
out
this
shaggy
black
mane
.
<EOS>
I
find
you
rather
alarming
,
when
I
examine
you
close
at
hand
:
you
talk
of
my
being
a
fairy
,
but
I
am
sure
,
you
are
more
like
a
brownie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
hideous
,
Jane
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
,
sir
:
you
always
were
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
<EOS>
The
wickedness
has
not
been
taken
out
of
you
,
wherever
you
have
sojourned
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
I
have
been
with
good
people
;
far
better
than
you
:
a
hundred
times
better
people
;
possessed
of
ideas
and
views
<EOS>
you
never
entertained
in
your
life
:
quite
more
refined
and
exalted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
the
deuce
have
you
been
with
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
twist
in
that
way
you
will
make
me
pull
the
hair
out
of
your
head
;
and
then
I
think
you
will
cease
to
entertain
doubts
of
my
substantiality
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
have
you
been
with
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
get
it
out
of
me
to
-
night
,
sir
;
you
must
wait
till
to
-
morrow
;
to
leave
my
tale
half
told
,
will
,
you
know
,
be
a
sort
of
security
that
I
shall
appear
at
your
breakfast
table
to
finish
it
.
<EOS>
By
the
bye
,
I
must
mind
not
to
rise
on
your
hearth
with
only
a
glass
of
water
then
:
I
must
bring
an
egg
at
the
least
,
to
say
nothing
of
fried
ham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mocking
changeling
 
fairy
-
born
and
human
-
bred
!
<EOS>
You
make
me
feel
as
I
have
not
felt
these
twelve
months
.
<EOS>
If
Saul
could
have
had
you
for
his
David
,
the
evil
spirit
would
have
been
exorcised
without
the
aid
of
the
harp
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
sir
,
you
are
redd
up
and
made
decent
.
<EOS>
Now
I
'll
leave
you
:
I
have
been
travelling
these
last
three
days
,
and
I
believe
I
am
tired
.
<EOS>
Good
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
one
word
,
Jane
:
were
there
only
ladies
in
the
house
where
you
have
been
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
laughed
and
made
my
escape
,
still
laughing
as
I
ran
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
A
good
idea
!
<EOS>
"
I
thought
with
glee
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
I
have
the
means
of
fretting
him
out
of
his
melancholy
for
some
time
to
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
Very
early
the
next
morning
I
heard
him
up
and
astir
,
wandering
from
one
room
to
another
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Mary
came
down
I
heard
the
question
:
"
Is
Miss
Eyre
here
?
"
<EOS>
Then
:
"
Which
room
did
you
put
her
into
?
<EOS>
Was
it
dry
?
<EOS>
Is
she
up
?
<EOS>
Go
and
ask
if
she
wants
anything
;
and
when
she
will
come
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
came
down
as
soon
as
I
thought
there
was
a
prospect
of
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Entering
the
room
very
softly
,
I
had
a
view
of
him
before
he
discovered
my
presence
.
<EOS>
It
was
mournful
,
indeed
,
to
witness
the
subjugation
of
that
vigorous
spirit
to
a
corporeal
infirmity
.
<EOS>
He
sat
in
his
chair
 
still
,
but
not
at
rest
:
expectant
evidently
;
the
lines
of
now
habitual
sadness
marking
his
strong
features
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
reminded
one
of
a
lamp
quenched
,
waiting
to
be
re
-
lit
 
and
alas
!
<EOS>
it
was
not
himself
that
could
now
kindle
the
lustre
of
animated
expression
:
he
was
dependent
on
another
for
that
office
!
<EOS>
I
had
meant
to
be
gay
and
careless
,
but
the
powerlessness
of
the
strong
man
touched
my
heart
to
the
quick
:
still
I
accosted
him
with
what
vivacity
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
bright
,
sunny
morning
,
sir
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
rain
is
over
and
gone
,
and
there
is
a
tender
shining
after
it
:
you
shall
have
a
walk
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
wakened
the
glow
:
his
features
beamed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
are
indeed
there
,
my
skylark
!
<EOS>
Come
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
gone
:
not
vanished
?
<EOS>
I
heard
one
of
your
kind
an
hour
ago
,
singing
high
over
the
wood
:
but
its
song
had
no
music
for
me
,
any
more
than
the
rising
sun
had
rays
.
<EOS>
All
the
melody
on
earth
is
concentrated
in
my
Jane
's
tongue
to
my
ear
<EOS>
(
I
am
glad
it
is
not
naturally
a
silent
one
)
:
<EOS>
all
the
sunshine
I
can
feel
is
in
her
presence
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
water
stood
in
my
eyes
to
hear
this
avowal
of
his
dependence
;
just
as
if
a
royal
eagle
,
chained
to
a
perch
,
should
be
forced
to
entreat
a
sparrow
to
become
its
purveyor
.
<EOS>
But
I
would
not
be
lachrymose
:
I
dashed
off
the
salt
drops
,
and
busied
myself
with
preparing
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
Most
of
the
morning
was
spent
in
the
open
air
.
<EOS>
I
led
him
out
of
the
wet
and
wild
wood
into
some
cheerful
fields
:
I
described
to
him
how
brilliantly
green
they
were
;
how
the
flowers
and
hedges
looked
refreshed
;
how
sparklingly
blue
was
the
sky
.
<EOS>
I
sought
a
seat
for
him
in
a
hidden
and
lovely
spot
,
a
dry
stump
of
a
tree
;
nor
did
I
refuse
to
let
him
,
when
seated
,
place
me
on
his
knee
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
,
when
both
he
and
I
were
happier
near
than
apart
?
<EOS>
Pilot
lay
beside
us
:
all
was
quiet
.
<EOS>
He
broke
out
suddenly
while
clasping
me
in
his
arms
    
"
Cruel
,
cruel
deserter
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
Jane
,
what
did
I
feel
when
I
discovered
you
had
fled
from
Thornfield
,
and
when
I
could
nowhere
find
you
;
and
,
after
examining
your
apartment
,
ascertained
that
you
had
taken
no
money
,
nor
anything
which
could
serve
as
an
equivalent
!
<EOS>
A
pearl
necklace
I
had
given
you
lay
untouched
in
its
little
casket
;
your
trunks
were
left
corded
and
locked
as
they
had
been
prepared
for
the
bridal
tour
.
<EOS>
What
could
my
darling
do
,
I
asked
,
left
destitute
and
penniless
?
<EOS>
And
what
did
she
do
?
<EOS>
Let
me
hear
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thus
urged
,
I
began
the
narrative
of
my
experience
for
the
last
year
.
<EOS>
I
softened
considerably
what
related
to
the
three
days
of
wandering
and
starvation
,
because
to
have
told
him
all
would
have
been
to
inflict
unnecessary
pain
:
the
little
I
did
say
lacerated
his
faithful
heart
deeper
than
I
wished
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
left
him
thus
,
he
said
,
without
any
means
of
making
my
way
:
I
should
have
told
him
my
intention
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
confided
in
him
:
he
would
never
have
forced
me
to
be
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
Violent
as
he
had
seemed
in
his
despair
,
he
,
in
truth
,
loved
me
far
too
well
and
too
tenderly
to
constitute
himself
my
tyrant
:
he
would
have
given
me
half
his
fortune
,
without
demanding
so
much
as
a
kiss
in
return
,
rather
than
I
should
have
flung
myself
friendless
on
the
wide
world
.
<EOS>
I
had
endured
,
he
was
certain
,
more
than
I
had
confessed
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
whatever
my
sufferings
had
been
,
they
were
very
short
,
"
I
answered
:
and
then
I
proceeded
to
tell
him
how
I
had
been
received
at
Moor
House
;
how
I
had
obtained
the
office
of
schoolmistress
,
&
<EOS>
c.
The
accession
of
fortune
,
the
discovery
of
my
relations
,
followed
in
due
order
.
<EOS>
Of

St.
John
Rivers
'
name
came
in
frequently
in
the
progress
of
my
tale
.
<EOS>
When
I
had
done
,
that
name
was
immediately
taken
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
St.
John
,
then
,
is
your
cousin
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
spoken
of
him
often
:
do
you
like
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
a
very
good
man
,
sir
;
I
could
not
help
liking
him
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
A
good
man
.
<EOS>
Does
that
mean
a
respectable
well
-
conducted
man
of
fifty
?
<EOS>
Or
what
does
it
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
St
John
was
only
twenty
-
nine
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
_
Jeune
encore
_
,
"
as
the
French
say
.
<EOS>
Is
he
a
person
of
low
stature
,
phlegmatic
,
and
plain
.
<EOS>
A
person
whose
goodness
consists
rather
in
his
guiltlessness
of
vice
,
than
in
his
prowess
in
virtue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
untiringly
active
.
<EOS>
Great
and
exalted
deeds
are
what
he
lives
to
perform
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
his
brain
?
<EOS>
That
is
probably
rather
soft
?
<EOS>
He
means
well
:
but
you
shrug
your
shoulders
to
hear
him
talk
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
talks
little
,
sir
:
what
he
does
say
is
ever
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
His
brain
is
first
-
rate
,
I
should
think
not
impressible
,
but
vigorous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
an
able
man
,
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Truly
able
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
thoroughly
educated
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
St.
John
is
an
accomplished
and
profound
scholar
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
manners
,
I
think
,
you
said
are
not
to
your
taste
?
 
<EOS>
priggish
and
parsonic
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
mentioned
his
manners
;
but
,
unless
I
had
a
very
bad
taste
,
they
must
suit
it
;
they
are
polished
,
calm
,
and
gentlemanlike
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
appearance
,
 
I
forget
what
description
you
gave
of
his
appearance
;
 
a
sort
of
raw
curate
,
half
strangled
with
his
white
neckcloth
,
and
stilted
up
on
his
thick
-
soled
high
-
lows
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
St.
John
dresses
well
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
handsome
man
:
tall
,
fair
,
with
blue
eyes
,
and
a
Grecian
profile
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
Aside
.
)
<EOS>
"
Damn
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
(
To
me
.
)
<EOS>
"
Did
you
like
him
,
Jane
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr.
Rochester
,
I
liked
him
:
but
you
asked
me
that
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
perceived
,
of
course
,
the
drift
of
my
interlocutor
.
<EOS>
Jealousy
had
got
hold
of
him
:
she
stung
him
;
but
the
sting
was
salutary
:
it
gave
him
respite
from
the
gnawing
fang
of
melancholy
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
,
therefore
,
immediately
charm
the
snake
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
would
rather
not
sit
any
longer
on
my
knee
,
Miss
Eyre
?
<EOS>
"
was
the
next
somewhat
unexpected
observation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
,
Mr.
Rochester
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
picture
you
have
just
drawn
is
suggestive
of
a
rather
too
overwhelming
contrast
.
<EOS>
Your
words
have
delineated
very
prettily
a
graceful
Apollo
:
he
is
present
to
your
imagination
,
 
tall
,
fair
,
blue-
eyed
,
and
with
a
Grecian
profile
.
<EOS>
Your
eyes
dwell
on
a
Vulcan
,
 
a
real
blacksmith
,
brown
,
broad
-
shouldered
:
and
blind
and
lame
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
thought
of
it
,
before
;
but
you
certainly
are
rather
like
Vulcan
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
can
leave
me
,
ma'am
:
<EOS>
but
before
you
go
"
(
and
he
retained
me
by
a
firmer
grasp
than
ever
)
,
"
you
will
be
pleased
just
to
answer
me
a
question
or
two
.
"
<EOS>
He
paused
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
questions
,
Mr.
Rochester
?
"
  
Then
followed
this
cross
-
examination
.
  
<EOS>
"
St.
John
made
you
schoolmistress
of
Morton
before
he
knew
you
were
his
cousin
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
often
see
him
?
<EOS>
He
would
visit
the
school
sometimes
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Daily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
approve
of
your
plans
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
I
know
they
would
be
clever
,
for
you
are
a
talented
creature
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
approved
of
them
 
yes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
discover
many
things
in
you
<EOS>
he
could
not
have
expected
to
find
?
<EOS>
Some
of
your
accomplishments
are
not
ordinary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
a
little
cottage
near
the
school
,
you
say
:
did
he
ever
come
there
to
see
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Now
and
then
?
"
  
"
Of
an
evening
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Once
or
twice
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
did
you
reside
with
him
and
his
sisters
after
the
cousinship
was
discovered
?
"
  
"
Five
months
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Did
Rivers
spend
much
time
with
the
ladies
of
his
family
?
"
  
"
Yes
;
the
back
parlour
was
both
his
study
and
ours
:
he
sat
near
the
window
,
and
we
by
the
table
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
he
study
much
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
good
deal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
  
"
Hindostanee
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
you
do
meantime
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
learnt
German
,
at
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
he
teach
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
not
understand
German
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
he
teach
you
nothing
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
A
little
Hindostanee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Rivers
taught
you
Hindostanee
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
his
sisters
also
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ask
to
learn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
wished
to
teach
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
second
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
he
wish
it
?
<EOS>
Of
what
use
could
Hindostanee
be
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
intended
me
to
go
with
him
to
India
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
here
I
reach
the
root
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
you
to
marry
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
asked
me
to
marry
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
fiction
 
an
impudent
invention
to
vex
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
it
is
the
literal
truth
:
he
asked
me
more
than
once
,
and
was
as
stiff
about
urging
his
point
as
ever
<EOS>
you
could
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Eyre
,
I
repeat
it
,
you
can
leave
me
.
<EOS>
How
often
am
I
to
say
the
same
thing
?
<EOS>
Why
do
you
remain
pertinaciously
perched
on
my
knee
,
when
I
have
given
you
notice
to
quit
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
am
comfortable
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Jane
,
you
are
not
comfortable
there
,
because
your
heart
is
not
with
me
:
it
is
with
this
cousin
 
<EOS>
this
St.
John
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
till
this
moment
,
I
thought
my
little
Jane
was
all
mine
!
<EOS>
I
had
a
belief
she
loved
me
even
when
she
left
me
:
that
was
an
atom
of
sweet
in
much
bitter
.
<EOS>
Long
as
we
have
been
parted
,
hot
tears
as
I
have
wept
over
our
separation
<EOS>
,
I
never
thought
that
while
I
was
mourning
her
,
she
was
loving
another
!
<EOS>
But
it
is
useless
grieving
.
<EOS>
Jane
,
leave
me
:
go
and
marry
Rivers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shake
me
off
,
then
,
sir
,
 
push
me
away
,
for
I
'll
not
leave
you
of
my
own
accord
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
I
ever
like
your
tone
of
voice
:
it
still
renews
hope
<EOS>
,
it
sounds
so
truthful
.
<EOS>
When
I
hear
it
,
it
carries
me
back
a
year
.
<EOS>
I
forget
that
you
have
formed
a
new
tie
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
a
fool
 
<EOS>
go
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
must
I
go
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
own
way
 
with
the
husband
you
have
chosen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
 
this
St.
John
Rivers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
my
husband
,
nor
ever
will
be
.
<EOS>
He
does
not
love
me
:
I
do
not
love
him
.
<EOS>
He
loves
(
as
he
_
can
_
love
,
and
that
is
not
as
you
love
)
a
beautiful
young
lady
called
Rosamond
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
to
marry
me
only
because
he
thought
I
should
make
a
suitable
missionary
's
wife
,
which
she
would
not
have
done
.
<EOS>
He
is
good
and
great
,
but
severe
;
and
,
for
me
,
cold
as
an
iceberg
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
like
you
,
sir
:
I
am
not
happy
at
his
side
,
nor
near
him
,
nor
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
has
no
indulgence
for
me
 
no
fondness
.
<EOS>
He
sees
nothing
attractive
in
me
;
not
even
youth
 
only
a
few
useful
mental
points
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
must
leave
you
,
sir
,
to
go
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
shuddered
involuntarily
,
and
clung
instinctively
closer
to
my
blind
but
beloved
master
.
<EOS>
He
smiled
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
Jane
!
<EOS>
Is
this
true
?
<EOS>
Is
such
really
the
state
of
matters
between
you
and
Rivers
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Absolutely
,
sir
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
need
not
be
jealous
!
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
tease
you
a
little
to
make
you
less
sad
:
I
thought
anger
would
be
better
than
grief
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
wish
me
to
love
you
,
could
you
but
see
how
much
I
_
do
<EOS>
_
love
you
<EOS>
,
you
would
be
proud
and
content
.
<EOS>
All
my
heart
is
yours
,
sir
<EOS>
:
it
belongs
to
you
;
and
with
you
it
would
remain
,
were
fate
to
exile
the
rest
of
me
from
your
presence
for
ever
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
,
as
he
kissed
me
,
painful
thoughts
darkened
his
aspect
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
seared
vision
!
<EOS>
My
crippled
strength
!
"
<EOS>
he
murmured
regretfully
.
  
<EOS>
I
caressed
,
in
order
to
soothe
him
.
<EOS>
I
knew
of
what
he
was
thinking
,
and
wanted
to
speak
for
him
,
but
dared
not
.
<EOS>
As
he
turned
aside
his
face
a
minute
,
I
saw
a
tear
slide
from
under
the
sealed
eyelid
,
and
trickle
down
the
manly
cheek
.
<EOS>
My
heart
swelled
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
no
better
than
the
old
lightning
-
struck
chestnut
-
tree
in
Thornfield
orchard
,
"
he
remarked
ere
long
.
"
<EOS>
And
what
right
would
that
ruin
have
to
bid
a
budding
woodbine
cover
its
decay
with
freshness
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
no
ruin
,
sir
 
<EOS>
no
lightning
-
struck
tree
<EOS>
:
you
are
green
and
vigorous
.
<EOS>
Plants
will
grow
about
your
roots
,
whether
you
ask
them
or
not
,
because
they
take
delight
in
your
bountiful
shadow
;
and
as
they
grow
they
will
lean
towards
you
,
and
wind
round
you
,
because
your
strength
offers
them
so
safe
a
prop
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
he
smiled
:
I
gave
him
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
speak
of
friends
,
Jane
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
of
friends
,
"
I
answered
rather
hesitatingly
:
for
I
knew
I
meant
more
than
friends
,
but
could
not
tell
what
other
word
to
employ
.
<EOS>
He
helped
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
Jane
.
<EOS>
But
I
want
a
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
:
is
it
news
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
:
you
said
nothing
about
it
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
unwelcome
news
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
That
depends
on
circumstances
,
sir
 
on
your
choice
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Which
you
shall
make
for
me
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
I
will
abide
by
your
decision
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Choose
then
,
sir
 
<EOS>
_
her
who
loves
you
best
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
at
least
choose
 
_
<EOS>
her
<EOS>
I
love
best
_
.
<EOS>
Jane
,
will
you
marry
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
poor
blind
man
,
whom
you
will
have
to
lead
about
by
the
hand
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
crippled
man
,
twenty
years
older
than
you
,
whom
you
will
have
to
wait
on

<EOS>
"
Yes

Truly
,
Jane

<EOS>

Most
truly

"
<EOS>
Oh

God
bless
you

reward
you

"
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester

if
ever
I
did
a
good
deed
in
my
life
 
if
ever
I
thought
a
good
thought

prayed

wife
is
,
for
me
,
to
be
as
happy
as
I
can
be
on
earth
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
you
delight
in
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sacrifice
!
<EOS>
What
do
I
sacrifice
?
<EOS>
Famine
for
food
,
expectation
for
content
.
<EOS>
To
be
privileged
to
put
my
arms
round
what
I
value
 
to
press
my
lips
to
what
I
love
 
to
repose
on
what
I
trust
:
is
that
to
make
a
sacrifice
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
then
certainly
I
delight
in
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
to
bear
with
my
infirmities
,
Jane
:
to
overlook
my
deficiencies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Which
are
none
,
sir
,
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
love
you
better
now
,
when
I
can
really
be
useful
to
you
,
than
I
did
in
your
state
of
proud
independence
,
when
you
disdained
every
part
but
that
of
the
giver
and
protector
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hitherto
I
have
hated
to
be
helped
 
to
be
led
:
henceforth
,
I
feel
I
shall
hate
it
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
like
to
put
my
hand
into
a
hireling
's
,
but
it
is
pleasant
to
feel
it
circled
by
Jane
's
little
fingers
.
<EOS>
I
preferred
utter
loneliness
to
the
constant
attendance
of
servants
;
but
Jane
's
soft
ministry
will
be
a
perpetual
joy
.
<EOS>
Jane
suits
me
:
do
I
suit
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
the
finest
fibre
of
my
nature
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
case
being
so
,
we
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
wait
for
:
we
must
be
married
instantly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
and
spoke
with
eagerness
:
his
old
impetuosity
was
rising
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
become
one
flesh
without
any
delay
,
Jane
:
there
is
but
the
licence
to
get
 
<EOS>
then
we
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Rochester
,
I
have
just
discovered
the
sun
is
far
declined
from
its
meridian
,
and
Pilot
is
actually
gone
home
to
his
dinner
.
<EOS>
Let
me
look
at
your
watch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fasten
it
into
your
girdle
,
Janet
,
and
keep
it
henceforward
:
I
have
no
use
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
nearly
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
feel
hungry
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
third
day
from
this
must
be
our
wedding
-
day
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
fine
clothes
and
jewels
,
now
:
all
that
is
not
worth
a
fillip
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
sun
has
dried
up
all
the
rain
-
drops
,
sir
.
<EOS>
The
breeze
is
still
:
it
is
quite
hot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
Jane
,
I
have
your
little
pearl
necklace
at
this
moment
fastened
round
my
bronze
scrag
under
my
cravat
?
<EOS>
I
have
worn
it
since
the
day
I
lost
my
only
treasure
,
as
a
memento
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
go
home
through
the
wood
:
that
will
be
the
shadiest
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
pursued
his
own
thoughts
without
heeding
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
!
<EOS>
you
think
me
,
I
daresay
,
an
irreligious
dog
:
<EOS>
but
my
heart
swells
with
gratitude
to
the
beneficent
God
of
this
earth
just
now
.
<EOS>
He
sees
not
as
man
sees
,
but
far
clearer
:
<EOS>
judges
not
as
man
judges
,
but
far
more
wisely
.
<EOS>
I
did
wrong
:
I
would
have
sullied
my
innocent
flower
 
<EOS>
breathed
guilt
on
its
purity
:
the
Omnipotent
snatched
it
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
,
in
my
stiff-
necked
rebellion
,
almost
cursed
the
dispensation
:
instead
of
bending
to
the
decree
,
I
defied
it
.
<EOS>
Divine
justice
pursued
its
course
;
disasters
came
thick
on
me
:
I
was
forced
to
pass
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
His
_
chastisements
are
mighty
;
and
one
smote
me
which
has
humbled
me
for
ever
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
was
proud
of
my
strength
:
<EOS>
but
what
is
it
now
,
when
I
must
give
it
over
to
foreign
guidance
,
as
a
child
does
its
weakness
?
<EOS>
Of
late
,
Jane
 
<EOS>
only
 
only
of
late
 
<EOS>
I
began
to
see
and
acknowledge
the
hand
of
God
in
my
doom
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
experience
remorse
,
repentance
;
the
wish
for
reconcilement
to
my
Maker
.
<EOS>
I
began
sometimes
to
pray
:
very
brief
prayers
they
were
,
but
very
sincere
.
  
<EOS>
"
Some
days
since
:
nay
,
I
can
number
them
 
four
;
it
was
last
Monday
night
,
a
singular
mood
came
over
me
:
one
in
which
grief
replaced
frenzy
 
sorrow
,
sullenness
.
<EOS>
I
had
long
had
the
impression
that
since
I
could
nowhere
find
you
,
you
must
be
dead
.
<EOS>
Late
that
night
 
perhaps
it
might
be
between
eleven
and
twelve
o'clock
 
<EOS>
ere
<EOS>
I
retired
to
my
dreary
rest
,
I
supplicated
God
,
that
,
if
it
seemed
good
to
Him
,
I
might
soon
be
taken
from
this
life
,
and
admitted
to
that
world
to
come
,
where
there
was
still
hope
of
rejoining
Jane
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
in
my
own
room
,
and
sitting
by
the
window
,
which
was
open
:
it
soothed
me
to
feel
the
balmy
night
-
air
;
though
I
could
see
no
stars
and
only
by
a
vague
,
luminous
haze
,
knew
the
presence
of
a
moon
.
<EOS>
I
longed
for
thee
,
Janet
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
longed
for
thee
both
with
soul
and
flesh
!
<EOS>
I
asked
of
God
,
at
once
in
anguish
and
humility
,
if
I
had
not
been
long
enough
desolate
,
afflicted
,
tormented
;
and
might
not
soon
taste
bliss
and
peace
once
more
.
<EOS>
That
I
merited
all
I
endured
,
I
acknowledged
 
that
I
could
scarcely
endure
more
,
I
pleaded
;
and
the
alpha
and
omega
of
my
heart
's
wishes
broke
involuntarily
from
my
lips
in
the
words
 
"
Jane
!
<EOS>
Jane
!
<EOS>
Jane
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Did
you
speak
these
words
aloud
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
If
any
listener
had
heard
me
,
he
would
have
thought
me
mad
<EOS>
:
I
pronounced
them
with
such
frantic
energy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
was
last
Monday
night
,
somewhere
near
midnight
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
but
the
time
is
of
no
consequence
:
what
followed
is
the
strange
point
.
<EOS>
You
will
think
me
superstitious
,
 
some
superstition
I
have
in
my
blood
,
and
always
had
:
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
this
is
true
 
true
at
least
it
is
that
I
heard
what
I
now
relate
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
I
exclaimed
"
Jane
!
<EOS>
Jane
!
<EOS>
Jane
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
voice
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
whence
the
voice
came
,
but
<EOS>
I
know
whose
voice
it
was
 
replied
,
"
I
am
coming
:
<EOS>
wait
for
me
;
"
and
a
moment
after
,
went
whispering
on
the
wind
the
words
 
"
Where
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
,
if
I
can
,
the
idea
,
the
picture
these
words
opened
to
my
mind
:
yet
it
is
difficult
to
express
what
I
want
to
express
.
<EOS>
Ferndean
is
buried
,
as
you
see
,
in
a
heavy
wood
,
where
sound
falls
dull
,
and
dies
unreverberating
.
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
?
"
seemed
spoken
amongst
mountains
;
for
I
heard
a
hill
-
sent
echo
repeat
the
words
.
<EOS>
Cooler
and
fresher
at
the
moment
the
gale
seemed
to
visit
my
brow
:
I
could
have
deemed
that
in
some
wild
,
lone
scene
,
I
and
Jane
were
meeting
.
<EOS>
In
spirit
,
I
believe
we
must
have
met
.
<EOS>
You
no
doubt
were
,
at
that
hour
,
in
unconscious
sleep
,
Jane
:
perhaps
your
soul
wandered
from
its
cell
to
comfort
mine
;
for
those
were
your
accents
 
<EOS>
as
certain
as
I
live
 
<EOS>
they
were
yours
!
"
  
<EOS>
Reader
,
it
was
on
Monday
night
 
near
midnight
 
that
I
too
had
received
the
mysterious
summons
:
those
were
the
very
words
by
which
I
replied
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
listened
to
Mr.
Rochester
's
narrative
,
but
made
no
disclosure
in
return
.
<EOS>
The
coincidence
struck
me
as
too
awful
and
inexplicable
to
be
communicated
or
discussed
.
<EOS>
If
I
told
anything
,
my
tale
would
be
such
as
must
necessarily
make
a
profound
impression
on
the
mind
of
my
hearer
:
and
that
mind
,
yet
from
its
sufferings
too
prone
to
gloom
,
needed
not
the
deeper
shade
of
the
supernatural
.
<EOS>
I
kept
these
things
then
,
and
pondered
them
in
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
now
wonder
,
"
continued
my
master
,
"
that
when
you
rose
upon
me
so
unexpectedly
last
night
,
I
had
difficulty
in
believing
you
any
other
than
a
mere
voice
and
vision
,
something
that
would
melt
to
silence
and
annihilation
,
as
the
midnight
whisper
and
mountain
echo
had
melted
before
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
thank
God
!
<EOS>
I
know
it
to
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
thank
God
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
me
off
his
knee
,
rose
,
and
reverently
lifting
his
hat
from
his
brow
,
and
bending
his
sightless
eyes
to
the
earth
,
he
stood
in
mute
devotion
.
<EOS>
Only
the
last
words
of
the
worship
were
audible
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
my
Maker
,
that
,
in
the
midst
of
judgment
,
he
has
remembered
mercy
.
<EOS>
I
humbly
entreat
my
Redeemer
to
give
me
strength
to
lead
henceforth
a
purer
life
than
I
have
done
hitherto
!
"
  
<EOS>
Then
he
stretched
his
hand
out
to
be
led
.
<EOS>
I
took
that
dear
hand
,
held
it
a
moment
to
my
lips
,
then
let
it
pass
round
my
shoulder
:
being
so
much
lower
of
stature
than
he
,
I
served
both
for
his
prop
and
guide
.
<EOS>
We
entered
the
wood
,
and
wended
homeward
.
    
<EOS>
Reader
,
I
married
him
.
<EOS>
A
quiet
wedding
we
had
:
he
and
I
,
the
parson
and
clerk
,
were
alone
present
.
<EOS>
When
we
got
back
from
church
,
I
went
into
the
kitchen
of
the
manor
-
house
,
where
Mary
was
cooking
the
dinner
and
John
cleaning
the
knives
,
and
I
said
    
"
Mary
<EOS>
,
I
have
been
married
to
Mr.
Rochester
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
housekeeper
and
her
husband
were
both
of
that
decent
phlegmatic
order
of
people
,
to
whom
one
may
at
any
time
safely
communicate
a
remarkable
piece
of
news
without
incurring
the
danger
of
having
one
's
ears
pierced
by
some
shrill
ejaculation
,
and
subsequently
stunned
by
a
torrent
of
wordy
wonderment
.
<EOS>
Mary
did
look
up
,
and
she
did
stare
at
me
:
the
ladle
with
which
she
was
basting
a
pair
of
chickens
roasting
at
the
fire
,
did
for
some
three
minutes
hang
suspended
in
air
;
and
for
the
same
space
of
time
John
's
knives
also
had
rest
from
the
polishing
process
:
<EOS>
but
Mary
,
bending
again
over
the
roast
,
said
only
    
"
<EOS>
Have
you
,
Miss
?
<EOS>
Well
,
for
sure
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
short
time
after
she
pursued
 
<EOS>
"
I
seed
you
go
out
with
the
master
,
but
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
you
were
gone
to
church
to
be
we
d
;
"
and
she
basted
away
.
<EOS>
John
,
when
I
turned
to
him
,
was
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
telled
Mary
how
it
would
be
,
"
he
said
:
"
I
knew
what
Mr.
Edward
"
(
John
was
an
old
servant
,
and
had
known
his
master
when
he
was
the
cadet
of
the
house
,
therefore
,
he
often
gave
him
his
Christian
name
)
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
what
Mr.
Edward
would
do
;
and
I
was
certain
<EOS>
he
would
not
wait
long
neither
:
<EOS>
and
he
's
done
right
,
for
aught
<EOS>
I
know
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
joy
,
Miss
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
politely
pulled
his
forelock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
John
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
told
me
to
give
you
and
Mary
this
.
<EOS>
"
I
put
into
his
hand
a
five
-
pound
note
.
<EOS>
Without
waiting
to
hear
more
,
I
left
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
In
passing
the
door
of
that
sanctum
some
time
after
,
I
caught
the
words
    
<EOS>
"
She
'll
happen
do
better
for
him
nor
ony
o't
'
grand
ladies
.
"
<EOS>
And
again
,
"
If
she
ben't
one
o
'
th
'
 
handsomest
,
she
's
noan
faal
and
varry
good
-
natured
;
and
i
'
his
een
she
's
fair
beautiful
<EOS>
,
onybody
may
see
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
wrote
to
Moor
House
and
to
Cambridge
immediately
,
to
say
what
I
had
done
:
fully
explaining
also
why
I
had
thus
acted
.
<EOS>
Diana
and
Mary
approved
the
step
unreservedly
.
<EOS>
Diana
announced
that
she
would
just
give
me
time
to
get
over
the
honeymoon
,
and
then
she
would
come
and
see
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
had
better
not
wait
till
then
,
Jane
,
"
said
Mr.
Rochester
,
when
I
read
her
letter
to
him
;
"
if
she
does
,
she
will
be
too
late
,
for
our
honeymoon
will
shine
our
life
long
:
its
beams
will
only
fade
over
your
grave
or
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
How
St.
John
received
the
news
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
:
he
never
answered
the
letter
in
which
I
communicated
it
:
yet
six
months
after
he
wrote
to
me
,
without
,
however
,
mentioning
Mr.
Rochester
's
name
or
alluding
to
my
marriage
.
<EOS>
His
letter
was
then
calm
,
and
,
though
very
serious
,
kind
.
<EOS>
He
has
maintained
a
regular
,
though
not
frequent
,
correspondence
ever
since
:
he
hopes
I
am
happy
,
and
trusts
I
am
not
of
those
who
live
without
God
in
the
world
,
and
only
mind
earthly
things
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
not
quite
forgotten
little
Adele
,
have
you
,
reader
?
<EOS>
I
had
not
;
I
soon
asked
and
obtained
leave
of
Mr.
Rochester
,
to
go
and
see
her
at
the
school
where
he
had
placed
her
.
<EOS>
Her
frantic
joy
at
beholding
me
again
moved
me
much
.
<EOS>
She
looked
pale
and
thin
:
she
said
she
was
not
happy
.
<EOS>
I
found
the
rules
of
the
establishment
were
too
strict
,
its
course
of
study
too
severe
for
a
child
of
her
age
<EOS>
:
I
took
her
home
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
meant
to
become
her
governess
once
more
,
but
I
soon
found
this
impracticable
;
my
time
and
cares
were
now
required
by
another
 
my
husband
needed
them
all
.
<EOS>
So
I
sought
out
a
school
conducted
on
a
more
indulgent
system
,
and
near
enough
to
permit
of
my
visiting
her
often
,
and
bringing
her
home
sometimes
.
<EOS>
I
took
care
<EOS>
she
should
never
want
for
anything
that
could
contribute
to
her
comfort
<EOS>
:
she
soon
settled
in
her
new
abode
,
became
very
happy
there
,
and
made
fair
progress
in
her
studies
.
<EOS>
As
she
grew
up
,
a
sound
English
education
corrected
in
a
great
measure
her
French
defects
;
and
when
she
left
school
,
I
found
in
her
a
pleasing
and
obliging
companion
:
docile
,
good
-
tempered
,
and
well
-
principled
.
<EOS>
By
her
grateful
attention
to
me
and
mine
,
she
has
long
since
well
repaid
any
little
kindness
I
ever
had
it
in
my
power
to
offer
her
.
  
<EOS>
My
tale
draws
to
its
close
:
one
word
respecting
my
experience
of
married
life
,
and
one
brief
glance
at
the
fortunes
of
those
whose
names
have
most
frequently
recurred
in
this
narrative
,
and
I
have
done
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
been
married
ten
years
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
it
is
to
live
entirely
for
and
with
what
I
love
best
on
earth
.
<EOS>
I
hold
myself
supremely
blest
 
<EOS>
blest
beyond
what
language
can
express
;
because
I
am
my
husband
's
life
as
fully
as
he
is
mine
.
<EOS>
No
woman
was
ever
nearer
to
her
mate
than
I
am
:
ever
more
absolutely
bone
of
his
bone
and
flesh
of
his
flesh
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
weariness
of
my
Edward
's
society
:
he
knows
none
of
mine
,
any
more
than
we
each
do
of
the
pulsation
of
the
heart
that
beats
in
our
separate
bosoms
;
consequently
,
we
are
ever
together
.
<EOS>
To
be
together
is
for
us
to
be
at
once
as
free
as
in
solitude
,
as
gay
as
in
company
.
<EOS>
We
talk
,
I
believe
,
all
day
long
:
to
talk
to
each
other
is
but
a
more
animated
and
an
audible
thinking
.
<EOS>
All
my
confidence
is
bestowed
on
him
,
all
his
confidence
is
devoted
to
me
;
we
are
precisely
suited
in
character
 
perfect
concord
is
the
result
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
continued
blind
the
first
two
years
of
our
union
;
perhaps
it
was
that
circumstance
that
drew
us
so
very
near
 
that
knit
us
so
very
close
:
for
I
was
then
his
vision
,
as
I
am
still
his
right
hand
.
<EOS>
Literally
,
I
was
(
what
he
often
called
me
)
<EOS>
the
apple
of
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
saw
nature
 
<EOS>
he
saw
books
through
me
;
and
never
did
I
weary
of
gazing
for
his
behalf
,
and
of
putting
into
words
the
effect
of
field
,
tree
,
town
,
river
,
cloud
,
sunbeam
 
of
the
landscape
before
us
;
of
the
weather
round
us
 
and
impressing
by
sound
on
his
ear
<EOS>
what
light
could
no
longer
stamp
on
his
eye
.
<EOS>
Never
did
I
weary
of
reading
to
him
;
never
did
I
weary
of
conducting
him
where
he
wished
to
go
:
of
doing
for
him
what
he
wished
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
a
pleasure
in
my
services
,
<EOS>
most
full
,
most
exquisite
,
even
though
sad
 
because
he
claimed
these
services
without
painful
shame
or
damping
humiliation
.
<EOS>
He
loved
me
so
truly
,
that
he
knew
no
reluctance
in
profiting
by
my
attendance
<EOS>
:
he
felt
I
loved
him
so
fondly
,
that
to
yield
that
attendance
was
to
indulge
my
sweetest
wishes
.
  
<EOS>
One
morning
at
the
end
of
the
two
years
,
as
I
was
writing
a
letter
to
his
dictation
,
he
came
and
bent
over
me
,
and
said
 
"
Jane
,
have
you
a
glittering
ornament
round
your
neck
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
a
gold
watch
-
chain
:
I
answered
"
Yes
.
"
  
"
And
have
you
a
pale
blue
dress
on
?
"
  
{
And
have
you
a
pale
blue
dress
on
?

}
  
<EOS>
I
had
.
<EOS>
He
informed
me
then
,
that
for
some
time
he
had
fancied
the
obscurity
clouding
one
eye
was
becoming
less
dense
;
and
that
now
he
was
sure
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
and
I
went
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
advice
of
an
eminent
oculist
;
and
he
eventually
recovered
the
sight
of
that
one
eye
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
now
see
very
distinctly
:
he
can
not
read
or
write
much
;
but
he
can
find
his
way
without
being
led
by
the
hand
:
the
sky
is
no
longer
a
blank
to
him
 
the
earth
no
longer
a
void
.
<EOS>
When
his
first
-
born
was
put
into
his
arms
,
he
could
see
that
the
boy
had
inherited
his
own
eyes
,
as
they
once
were
 
large
,
brilliant
,
and
black
.
<EOS>
On
that
occasion
,
he
again
,
with
a
full
heart
,
acknowledged
that
God
had
tempered
judgment
with
mercy
.
  
<EOS>
My
Edward
and
I
,
then
,
are
happy
:
and
the
more
so
,
because
those
we
most
love
are
happy
likewise
.
<EOS>
Diana
and
Mary
Rivers
are
both
married
:
alternately
,
once
every
year
,
they
come
to
see
us
,
and
we
go
to
see
them
.
<EOS>
Diana
's
husband
is
a
captain
in
the
navy
,
a
gallant
officer
and
a
good
man
.
<EOS>
Mary
's
is
a
clergyman
,
a
college
friend
of
her
brother
's
,
and
,
from
his
attainments
and
principles
,
worthy
of
the
connection
.
<EOS>
Both
Captain
Fitzjames
and
Mr.
Wharton
love
their
wives
,
and
are
loved
by
them
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
St.
John
Rivers
,
he
left
England
:
he
went
to
India
.
<EOS>
He
entered
on
the
path
he
had
marked
for
himself
;
he
pursues
it
still
.
<EOS>
A
more
resolute
,
indefatigable
pioneer
never
wrought
amidst
rocks
and
dangers
.
<EOS>
Firm
,
faithful
,
and
devoted
,
full
of
energy
,
and
zeal
,
and
truth
<EOS>
,
he
labours
for
his
race
;
he
clears
their
painful
way
to
improvement
;
he
hews
down
like
a
giant
the
prejudices
of
creed
and
caste
that
encumber
it
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
stern
;
he
may
be
exacting
;
he
may
be
ambitious
yet
;
but
his
is
the
sternness
of
the
warrior
Greatheart
,
who
guards
his
pilgrim
convoy
from
the
onslaught
of
Apollyon
.
<EOS>
His
is
the
exaction
of
the
apostle
,
who
speaks
but
for
Christ
,
when
he
says
 
"
Whosoever
will
come
after
me
,
let
him
deny
himself
,
and
take
up
his
cross
and
follow
me
.
"
<EOS>
His
is
the
ambition
of
the
high
master
-
spirit
,
which
aims
to
fill
a
place
in
the
first
rank
of
those
who
are
redeemed
from
the
earth
 
who
stand
without
fault
before
the
throne
of
God
,
who
share
the
last
mighty
victories
of
the
Lamb
,
who
are
called
,
and
chosen
,
and
faithful
.
  
<EOS>
St.
John
is
unmarried
:
he
never
will
marry
now
.
<EOS>
Himself
has
hitherto
sufficed
to
the
toil
,
and
the
toil
draws
near
its
close
:
<EOS>
his
glorious
sun
hastens
to
its
setting
.
<EOS>
The
last
letter
I
received
from
him
drew
from
my
eyes
human
tears
,
and
yet
filled
my
heart
with
divine
joy
:
he
anticipated
his
sure
reward
,
his
incorruptible
crown
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
a
stranger
's
hand
will
write
to
me
next
,
to
say
that
the
good
and
faithful
servant
has
been
called
at
length
into
the
joy
of
his
Lord
.
<EOS>
And
why
weep
for
this
?
<EOS>
No
fear
of
death
will
darken
St.
John
's
last
hour
:
his
mind
will
be
unclouded
,
his
heart
will
be
undaunted
,
his
hope
will
be
sure
,
his
faith
steadfast
.
<EOS>
His
own
words
are
a
pledge
of
this
    
"
My
Master
,
"
he
says
,
"
has
forewarned
me
.
<EOS>
Daily
He
announces
more
distinctly
,
 
"
Surely
I
come
quickly
!
"
<EOS>
and
hourly
I
more
eagerly
respond
,
 
<EOS>
"
Amen
;
even
so
come
,
Lord
Jesus
!

<EOS>
