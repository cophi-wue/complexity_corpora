   
BRETTON
.
  
<EOS>
My
godmother
lived
in
a
handsome
house
in
the
clean
and
ancient
town
of
Bretton
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
's
family
had
been
residents
there
for
generations
,
and
bore
,
indeed
,
the
name
of
their
birthplace
 
Bretton
of
Bretton
:
whether
by
coincidence
,
or
because
some
remote
ancestor
had
been
a
personage
of
sufficient
importance
to
leave
his
name
to
his
neighbourhood
,
I
know
not
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
was
a
girl
I
went
to
Bretton
about
twice
a
year
,
and
well
I
liked
the
visit
.
<EOS>
The
house
and
its
inmates
specially
suited
me
.
<EOS>
The
large
peaceful
rooms
,
the
well
-
arranged
furniture
,
the
clear
wide
windows
,
the
balcony
outside
,
looking
down
on
a
fine
antique
street
,
where
Sundays
and
holidays
seemed
always
to
abide
 
so
quiet
was
its
atmosphere
,
so
clean
its
pavement
 
<EOS>
these
things
pleased
me
well
.
  
<EOS>
One
child
in
a
household
of
grown
people
is
usually
made
very
much
of
,
and
in
a
quiet
way
I
was
a
good
deal
taken
notice
of
by
Mrs.
Bretton
,
who
had
been
left
a
widow
,
with
one
son
,
before
I
knew
her
;
her
husband
,
a
physician
,
having
died
while
she
was
yet
a
young
and
handsome
woman
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
not
young
,
as
I
remember
her
,
but
she
was
still
handsome
,
tall
,
well
-
made
,
and
though
dark
for
an
Englishwoman
,
yet
wearing
always
the
clearness
of
health
in
her
brunette
cheek
,
and
its
vivacity
in
a
pair
of
fine
,
cheerful
black
eyes
.
<EOS>
People
esteemed
it
a
grievous
pity
that
she
had
not
conferred
her
complexion
on
her
son
,
whose
eyes
were
blue
 
though
,
even
in
boyhood
,
very
piercing
 
and
the
colour
of
his
long
hair
such
as
friends
did
not
venture
to
specify
,
except
as
the
sun
shone
on
it
,
when
they
called
it
golden
.
<EOS>
He
inherited
the
lines
of
his
mother
's
features
,
however
;
also
her
good
teeth
,
her
stature
(
or
the
promise
of
her
stature
,
for
he
was
not
yet
full
-
grown
)
,
and
,
<EOS>
what
was
better
,
her
health
without
flaw
,
and
her
spirits
of
that
tone
and
equality
which
are
better
than
a
fortune
to
the
possessor
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
autumn
of
the
year
 
I
was
staying
at
Bretton
;
my
godmother
having
come
in
person
to
claim
me
of
the
kinsfolk
with
whom
was
at
that
time
fixed
my
permanent
residence
.
<EOS>
I
believe
she
then
plainly
saw
events
coming
,
whose
very
shadow
I
scarce
guessed
;
yet
of
which
the
faint
suspicion
sufficed
to
impart
unsettled
sadness
,
and
made
me
glad
to
change
scene
and
society
.
  
<EOS>
Time
always
flowed
smoothly
for
me
at
my
godmother
's
side
;
not
with
tumultuous
swiftness
,
but
blandly
,
like
the
gliding
of
a
full
river
through
a
plain
.
<EOS>
My
visits
to
her
resembled
the
sojourn
of
Christian
and
Hopeful
beside
a
certain
pleasant
stream
,
with
"
green
trees
on
each
bank
,
and
meadows
beautified
with
lilies
all
the
year
round
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
charm
of
variety
there
was
not
,
nor
the
excitement
of
incident
;
but
I
liked
peace
so
well
,
and
sought
stimulus
so
little
,
that
when
the
latter
came
I
almost
felt
it
a
disturbance
,
and
wished
rather
it
had
still
held
aloof
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
a
letter
was
received
of
which
the
contents
evidently
caused
Mrs.
Bretton
surprise
and
some
concern
.
<EOS>
I
thought
at
first
it
was
from
home
,
and
trembled
,
expecting
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
disastrous
communication
:
to
me
,
however
,
no
reference
was
made
,
and
the
cloud
seemed
to
pass
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
,
on
my
return
from
a
long
walk
,
I
found
,
as
I
entered
my
bedroom
,
an
unexpected
change
.
<EOS>
In
,
addition
to
my
own
French
bed
in
its
shady
recess
,
appeared
in
a
corner
a
small
crib
,
draped
with
white
;
and
in
addition
to
my
mahogany
chest
of
drawers
,
I
saw
a
tiny
rosewood
chest
.
<EOS>
I
stood
still
,
gazed
,
and
considered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
what
are
these
things
the
signs
and
tokens
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
The
answer
was
obvious
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
second
guest
is
coming
:
Mrs.
Bretton
expects
other
visitors
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
descending
to
dinner
,
explanations
ensued
.
<EOS>
A
little
girl
,
I
was
told
,
would
shortly
be
my
companion
:
the
daughter
of
a
friend
and
distant
relation
of
the
late
Dr.
Bretton
's
.
<EOS>
This
little
girl
,
it
was
added
,
had
recently
lost
her
mother
;
though
,
indeed
,
Mrs.
Bretton
ere
long
subjoined
,
the
loss
was
not
so
great
as
might
at
first
appear
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Home
(
Home
it
seems
was
the
name
)
had
been
a
very
pretty
,
but
a
giddy
,
careless
woman
,
who
had
neglected
her
child
,
and
disappointed
and
disheartened
her
husband
.
<EOS>
So
far
from
congenial
had
the
union
proved
,
that
separation
at
last
ensued
 
separation
by
mutual
consent
,
not
after
any
legal
process
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
event
,
the
lady
having
over
-
exerted
herself
at
a
ball
,
caught
cold
,
took
a
fever
,
and
died
after
a
very
brief
illness
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
,
naturally
a
man
of
very
sensitive
feelings
,
and
shocked
inexpressibly
by
too
sudden
communication
of
the
news
,
could
hardly
,
it
seems
,
now
be
persuaded
but
that
some
over
-
severity
on
his
part
 
some
deficiency
in
patience
and
indulgence
 
had
contributed
to
hasten
her
end
.
<EOS>
He
had
brooded
over
this
idea
till
his
spirits
were
seriously
affected
;
the
medical
men
insisted
on
travelling
being
tried
as
a
remedy
,
and
meanwhile
Mrs.
Bretton
had
offered
to
take
charge
of
his
little
girl
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
hope
,
"
added
my
godmother
in
conclusion
,
"
the
child
will
not
be
like
her
mamma
;
as
silly
and
frivolous
a
little
flirt
as
ever
sensible
man
was
weak
enough
to
marry
.
<EOS>
For
,
"
said
she
,
"
Mr.
Home
_
is
_
a
sensible
man
in
his
way
,
though
not
very
practical
:
he
is
fond
of
science
,
and
lives
half
his
life
in
a
laboratory
trying
experiments
 
a
thing
his
butterfly
wife
could
neither
comprehend
nor
endure
;
and
indeed
"
confessed
my
godmother
,
"
I
should
not
have
liked
it
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
answer
to
a
question
of
mine
,
she
further
informed
me
that
her
late
husband
used
to
say
,
Mr.
Home
had
derived
this
scientific
turn
from
a
maternal
uncle
,
a
French
savant
;
for
he
came
,
it
seems
;
of
mixed
French
and
Scottish
origin
,
and
had
connections
now
living
in
France
,
of
whom
more
than
one
wrote
_
de
_
before
his
name
,
and
called
himself
noble
.
  
<EOS>
That
same
evening
at
nine
o'clock
,
a
servant
was
despatched
to
meet
the
coach
by
which
our
little
visitor
was
expected
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
and
I
sat
alone
in
the
drawing
-
room
waiting
her
coming
;
John
Graham
Bretton
being
absent
on
a
visit
to
one
of
his
schoolfellows
who
lived
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
My
godmother
read
the
evening
paper
while
she
waited
;
I
sewed
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
wet
night
;
the
rain
lashed
the
panes
,
and
the
wind
sounded
angry
and
restless
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
child
!
"
said
Mrs.
Bretton
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
weather
for
her
journey
!
<EOS>
I
wish
she
were
safe
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
little
before
ten
the
door
-
bell
announced
Warren
's
return
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
was
the
door
opened
than
I
ran
down
into
the
hall
;
there
lay
a
trunk
and
some
band
-
boxes
,
beside
them
stood
a
person
like
a
nurse
-
girl
,
and
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
was
Warren
with
a
shawled
bundle
in
his
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
the
child
?
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
miss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
opened
the
shawl
,
and
tried
to
get
a
peep
at
the
face
,
but
it
was
hastily
turned
from
me
to
Warren
's
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Put
me
down
,
please
,
"
said
a
small
voice
when
Warren
opened
the
drawing
-
room
door
,
"
and
take
off
this
shawl
,
"
continued
the
speaker
,
extracting
with
its
minute
hand
the
pin
,
and
with
a
sort
of
fastidious
haste
doffing
the
clumsy
wrapping
.
<EOS>
The
creature
which
now
appeared
made
a
deft
attempt
to
fold
the
shawl
;
but
the
drapery
was
much
too
heavy
and
large
to
be
sustained
or
wielded
by
those
hands
and
arms
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Give
it
to
Harriet
,
please
,
"
was
then
the
direction
,
"
and
she
can
put
it
away
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
said
,
it
turned
and
fixed
its
eyes
on
Mrs.
Bretton
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
here
,
little
dear
,
"
said
that
lady
.
<EOS>
"
Come
and
let
me
see
if
you
are
cold
and
damp
:
come
and
let
me
warm
you
at
the
fire
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
child
advanced
promptly
.
<EOS>
Relieved
of
her
wrapping
,
she
appeared
exceedingly
tiny
;
but
was
a
neat
,
completely
-
fashioned
little
figure
,
light
,
slight
,
and
straight
.
<EOS>
Seated
on
my
godmother
's
ample
lap
,
she
looked
a
mere
doll
;
her
neck
,
delicate
as
wax
,
her
head
of
silky
curls
,
increased
,
I
thought
,
the
resemblance
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
talked
in
little
fond
phrases
as
she
chafed
the
child
's
hands
,
arms
,
and
feet
;
first
she
was
considered
with
a
wistful
gaze
,
but
soon
a
smile
answered
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
was
not
generally
a
caressing
woman
:
even
with
her
deeply
-
cherished
son
,
her
manner
was
rarely
sentimental
,
often
the
reverse
;
but
when
the
small
stranger
smiled
at
her
,
she
kissed
it
,
asking
,
"
What
is
my
little
one
's
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Missy
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
besides
Missy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Polly
,
papa
calls
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
Polly
be
content
to
live
with
me
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
_
always
_
;
but
till
papa
comes
home
.
<EOS>
Papa
is
gone
away
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
expressively
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
return
to
Polly
,
or
send
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
he
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
Do
you
know
he
will
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Harriet
thinks
not
:
at
least
not
for
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
He
is
ill
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
eyes
filled
.
<EOS>
She
drew
her
hand
from
Mrs.
Bretton
's
and
made
a
movement
to
leave
her
lap
;
it
was
at
first
resisted
,
but
she
said
 
"
Please
,
I
wish
to
go
:
I
can
sit
on
a
stool
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
allowed
to
slip
down
from
the
knee
,
and
taking
a
footstool
,
she
carried
it
to
a
corner
where
the
shade
was
deep
,
and
there
seated
herself
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
,
though
a
commanding
,
and
in
grave
matters
even
a
peremptory
woman
,
was
often
passive
in
trifles
:
she
allowed
the
child
her
way
.
<EOS>
She
said
to
me
,
"
Take
no
notice
at
present
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
did
take
notice
:
I
watched
Polly
rest
her
small
elbow
on
her
small
knee
<EOS>
,
her
head
on
her
hand
;
I
observed
her
draw
a
square
inch
or
two
of
pocket
-
handkerchief
from
the
doll
-
pocket
of
her
doll
-
skirt
,
and
then
I
heard
her
weep
.
<EOS>
Other
children
in
grief
or
pain
cry
aloud
,
without
shame
or
restraint
;
but
this
being
wept
:
the
tiniest
occasional
sniff
testified
to
her
emotion
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
did
not
hear
it
:
which
was
quite
as
well
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
a
voice
,
issuing
from
the
corner
,
demanded
 
"
May
the
bell
be
rung
for
Harriet
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
rang
;
the
nurse
was
summoned
and
came
.
  
<EOS>
"
Harriet
,
I
must
be
put
to
bed
,
"
said
her
little
mistress
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
ask
where
my
bed
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
Harriet
signified
that
she
had
already
made
that
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
if
you
sleep
with
me
,
Harriet
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Missy
,
"
said
the
nurse
:
"
you
are
to
share
this
young
lady
's
room
,
"
designating
me
.
  
<EOS>
Missy
did
not
leave
her
seat
,
but
I
saw
her
eyes
seek
me
.
<EOS>
After
some
minutes
'
silent
scrutiny
,
she
emerged
from
her
corner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
,
ma'am
,
good
night
,
"
said
she
to
Mrs.
Bretton
;
but
she
passed
me
mute
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
Polly
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
need
to
say
good
-
night
,
since
we
sleep
in
the
same
chamber
,
"
was
the
reply
,
with
which
she
vanished
from
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
We
heard
Harriet
propose
to
carry
her
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
need
,
"
was
again
her
answer
 
<EOS>
"
no
need
,
no
need
:
"
and
her
small
step
toiled
wearily
up
the
staircase
.
  
<EOS>
On
going
to
bed
an
hour
afterwards
,
I
found
her
still
wide
awake
.
<EOS>
She
had
arranged
her
pillows
so
as
to
support
her
little
person
in
a
sitting
posture
:
her
hands
,
placed
one
within
the
other
,
rested
quietly
on
the
sheet
,
with
an
old
-
fashioned
calm
most
unchildlike
.
<EOS>
I
abstained
from
speaking
to
her
for
some
time
,
but
just
before
extinguishing
the
light
,
I
recommended
her
to
lie
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
and
by
,
"
was
the
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
take
cold
,
Missy
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
took
some
tiny
article
of
raiment
from
the
chair
at
her
crib
side
,
and
with
it
covered
her
shoulders
.
<EOS>
I
suffered
her
to
do
as
she
pleased
.
<EOS>
Listening
awhile
in
the
darkness
,
I
was
aware
that
she
still
wept
,
 
<EOS>
wept
under
restraint
,
quietly
and
cautiously
.
  
<EOS>
On
awaking
with
daylight
,
a
trickling
of
water
caught
my
ear
.
<EOS>
Behold
!
<EOS>
there
she
was
risen
and
mounted
on
a
stool
near
the
washstand
,
with
pains
and
difficulty
inclining
the
ewer
(
which
she
could
not
lift
)
so
as
to
pour
its
contents
into
the
basin
.
<EOS>
It
was
curious
to
watch
her
as
she
washed
and
dressed
,
so
small
,
busy
,
and
noiseless
.
<EOS>
Evidently
she
was
little
accustomed
to
perform
her
own
toilet
;
and
the
buttons
,
strings
,
hooks
and
eyes
,
offered
difficulties
which
she
encountered
with
a
perseverance
good
to
witness
.
<EOS>
She
folded
her
night
-
dress
,
she
smoothed
the
drapery
of
her
couch
quite
neatly
;
withdrawing
into
a
corner
,
where
the
sweep
of
the
white
curtain
concealed
her
,
she
became
still
.
<EOS>
I
half
rose
,
and
advanced
my
,
head
to
see
how
she
was
occupied
.
<EOS>
On
her
knees
,
with
her
forehead
bent
on
her
hands
,
I
perceived
that
she
was
praying
.
  
<EOS>
Her
nurse
tapped
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
She
started
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
dressed
,
Harriet
,
"
said
she
;
"
I
have
dressed
myself
,
but
I
do
not
feel
neat
.
<EOS>
Make
me
neat
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
dress
yourself
,
Missy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
speak
low
,
Harriet
,
for
fear
of
waking
_
<EOS>
the
girl
_
"
<EOS>
(
meaning
me
,
who
now
lay
with
my
eyes
shut
)
.
<EOS>
"
I
dressed
myself
to
learn
,
against
the
time
you
leave
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
want
me
to
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
are
cross
,
I
have
many
a
time
wanted
you
to
go
,
but
not
now
.
<EOS>
Tie
my
sash
straight
;
make
my
hair
smooth
,
please
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
sash
is
straight
enough
.
<EOS>
What
a
particular
little
body
you
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
tied
again
.
<EOS>
Please
to
tie
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
then
.
<EOS>
When
I
am
gone
you
must
get
that
young
lady
to
dress
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
no
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
She
is
a
very
nice
young
lady
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
mean
to
behave
prettily
to
her
,
Missy
,
and
not
show
your
airs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
shall
dress
me
on
no
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Comical
little
thing
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
passing
the
comb
straight
through
my
hair
,
Harriet
;
the
line
will
be
crooked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
you
are
ill
to
please
.
<EOS>
Does
that
suit
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
.
<EOS>
Where
should
I
go
now
that
I
am
dressed
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
you
into
the
breakfast
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
then
.
"
  
They
proceeded
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
She
stopped
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Harriet
,
I
wish
this
was
papa
's
house
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
these
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Be
a
good
child
,
Missy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
good
,
but
I
ache
here
;
"
putting
her
hand
to
her
heart
,
and
moaning
while
she
reiterated
,
"
Papa
!
papa
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
roused
myself
and
started
up
,
to
check
this
scene
while
it
was
yet
within
bounds
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
good
-
morning
to
the
young
lady
,
"
dictated
Harriet
.
<EOS>
She
said
,
"
Good
-
morning
,
"
and
then
followed
her
nurse
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
Harriet
temporarily
left
that
same
day
,
to
go
to
her
own
friends
,
who
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
On
descending
,
I
found
Paulina
(
the
child
called
herself
Polly
,
but
her
full
name
was
Paulina
Mary
)
<EOS>
seated
at
the
breakfast
-
table
,
by
Mrs.
Bretton
's
side
;
a
mug
of
milk
stood
before
her
,
<EOS>
a
morsel
of
bread
filled
her
hand
,
which
lay
passive
on
the
table
-
cloth
:
she
was
not
eating
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
we
shall
conciliate
this
little
creature
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bretton
to
me
,
"
I
do
n't
know
:
<EOS>
she
tastes
nothing
,
and
by
her
looks
,
she
has
not
slept
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
expressed
my
confidence
in
the
effects
of
time
and
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
she
were
to
take
a
fancy
to
anybody
in
the
house
,
she
would
soon
settle
;
but
not
till
then
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Bretton
.
    
<EOS>
PAULINA
.
  
<EOS>
Some
days
elapsed
,
and
it
appeared
she
was
not
likely
to
take
much
of
a
fancy
to
anybody
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
exactly
naughty
or
wilful
:
she
was
far
from
disobedient
;
but
an
object
less
conducive
to
comfort
 
to
tranquillity
even
 
than
she
presented
,
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
have
before
one
's
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
moped
:
<EOS>
no
grown
person
could
have
performed
that
uncheering
business
better
;
no
furrowed
face
of
adult
exile
,
longing
for
Europe
at
Europe
's
antipodes
,
ever
bore
more
legibly
the
signs
of
home
sickness
than
did
her
infant
visage
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
growing
old
and
unearthly
.
<EOS>
I
,
Lucy
Snowe
,
plead
guiltless
of
that
curse
,
an
overheated
and
discursive
imagination
;
but
whenever
,
opening
a
room
-
door
,
I
found
her
seated
in
a
corner
alone
,
her
head
in
her
pigmy
hand
,
that
room
seemed
to
me
not
inhabited
,
but
haunted
.
  
<EOS>
And
again
,
when
of
moonlight
nights
,
on
waking
,
I
beheld
her
figure
,
white
and
conspicuous
in
its
night
-
dress
,
kneeling
upright
in
bed
,
and
praying
like
some
Catholic
or
Methodist
enthusiast
 
some
precocious
fanatic
or
untimely
saint
 
<EOS>
I
scarcely
know
what
thoughts
I
had
;
but
they
ran
risk
of
being
hardly
more
rational
and
healthy
than
that
child
's
mind
must
have
been
.
  
<EOS>
I
seldom
caught
a
word
of
her
prayers
,
for
they
were
whispered
low
:
<EOS>
sometimes
,
indeed
,
they
were
not
whispered
at
all
,
but
put
up
unuttered
;
such
rare
sentences
as
reached
my
ear
still
bore
the
burden
,
"
Papa
;
my
dear
papa
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
,
I
perceived
,
was
a
one
-
idea'd
nature
;
betraying
that
monomaniac
tendency
<EOS>
I
have
ever
thought
the
most
unfortunate
with
which
man
or
woman
can
be
cursed
.
  
<EOS>
What
might
have
been
the
end
of
this
fretting
,
had
it
continued
unchecked
,
can
only
be
conjectured
:
it
received
,
however
,
a
sudden
turn
.
  
<EOS>
One
afternoon
,
Mrs.
Bretton
,
coaxing
her
from
her
usual
station
in
a
corner
,
had
lifted
her
into
the
window
-
seat
,
and
,
by
way
of
occupying
her
attention
,
told
her
to
watch
the
passengers
and
count
how
many
ladies
should
go
down
the
street
in
a
given
time
.
<EOS>
She
had
sat
listlessly
,
hardly
looking
,
and
not
counting
,
when
 
my
eye
being
fixed
on
hers
 
<EOS>
I
witnessed
in
its
iris
and
pupil
a
startling
transfiguration
.
<EOS>
These
sudden
,
dangerous
natures
 
_
sensitive
_
as
they
are
called
 
offer
many
a
curious
spectacle
to
those
whom
a
cooler
temperament
has
secured
from
participation
in
their
angular
vagaries
.
<EOS>
The
fixed
and
heavy
gaze
swum
,
trembled
,
then
glittered
in
fire
;
the
small
,
overcast
brow
cleared
;
the
trivial
and
dejected
features
lit
up
;
the
sad
countenance
vanished
,
and
in
its
place
appeared
a
sudden
eagerness
,
an
intense
expectancy
.
<EOS>
"
It
_
is
_
!
<EOS>
"
were
her
words
.
  
<EOS>
Like
a
bird
or
a
shaft
,
or
any
other
swift
thing
,
she
was
gone
from
the
room
<EOS>
,
How
she
got
the
house
-
door
open
I
can
not
tell
;
probably
it
might
be
ajar
;
perhaps
Warren
was
in
the
way
and
obeyed
her
behest
,
which
would
be
impetuous
enough
.
<EOS>
I
 
watching
calmly
from
the
window
 
<EOS>
saw
her
,
in
her
black
frock
and
tiny
braided
apron
<EOS>
(
to
pinafores
she
had
an
antipathy
)
,
dart
half
the
length
of
the
street
;
and
,
as
I
was
on
the
point
of
turning
,
and
quietly
announcing
to
Mrs.
Bretton
that
the
child
was
run
out
mad
,
and
ought
instantly
to
be
pursued
<EOS>
,
I
saw
her
caught
up
,
and
rapt
at
once
from
my
cool
observation
,
and
from
the
wondering
stare
of
the
passengers
.
<EOS>
A
gentleman
had
done
this
good
turn
,
and
now
,
covering
her
with
his
cloak
,
advanced
to
restore
her
to
the
house
whence
he
had
seen
her
issue
.
  
<EOS>
I
concluded
he
would
leave
her
in
a
servant
's
charge
and
withdraw
;
but
he
entered
:
having
tarried
a
little
while
below
,
he
came
up
-
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
His
reception
immediately
explained
that
he
was
known
to
Mrs.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
She
recognised
him
;
she
greeted
him
,
and
yet
she
was
fluttered
,
surprised
,
taken
unawares
.
<EOS>
Her
look
and
manner
were
even
expostulatory
;
and
in
reply
to
these
,
rather
than
her
words
,
he
said
,
 
"
I
could
not
help
it
,
madam
:
<EOS>
I
found
it
impossible
to
leave
the
country
without
seeing
with
my
own
eyes
how
she
settled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
unsettle
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
.
<EOS>
And
how
is
papa
's
little
Polly
?
"
  
<EOS>
This
question
he
addressed
to
Paulina
,
as
he
sat
down
and
placed
her
gently
on
the
ground
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
Polly
's
papa
?
"
was
the
reply
,
as
she
leaned
on
his
knee
,
and
gazed
up
into
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
noisy
,
not
a
wordy
scene
:
for
that
I
was
thankful
;
but
it
was
a
scene
of
feeling
too
brimful
,
and
which
,
because
the
cup
did
not
foam
up
high
or
furiously
overflow
<EOS>
,
only
oppressed
one
the
more
.
<EOS>
On
all
occasions
of
vehement
,
unrestrained
expansion
,
a
sense
of
disdain
or
ridicule
comes
to
the
weary
spectator
's
relief
;
whereas
I
have
ever
felt
most
burdensome
that
sort
of
sensibility
which
bends
of
its
own
will
,
a
giant
slave
under
the
sway
of
good
sense
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Home
was
a
stern
-
featured
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
should
rather
say
,
a
hard
-
featured
man
:
his
forehead
was
knotty
,
and
his
cheekbones
were
marked
and
prominent
.
<EOS>
The
character
of
his
face
was
quite
Scotch
;
but
there
was
feeling
in
his
eye
,
and
emotion
in
his
now
agitated
countenance
.
<EOS>
His
northern
accent
in
speaking
harmonised
with
his
physiognomy
.
<EOS>
He
was
at
once
proud
-
looking
and
homely
-
looking
.
<EOS>
He
laid
his
hand
on
the
child
's
uplifted
head
.
<EOS>
She
said
 
"
Kiss
Polly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
kissed
her
.
<EOS>
I
wished
she
would
utter
some
hysterical
cry
,
so
that
I
might
get
relief
and
be
at
ease
.
<EOS>
She
made
wonderfully
little
noise
:
she
seemed
to
have
got
what
she
wanted
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
all
_
she
wanted
,
and
to
be
in
a
trance
of
content
.
<EOS>
Neither
in
mien
nor
in
features
was
this
creature
like
her
sire
,
and
yet
she
was
of
his
strain
<EOS>
:
her
mind
had
been
filled
from
his
,
as
the
cup
from
the
flagon
.
  
<EOS>
Indisputably
,
Mr.
Home
owned
manly
self
-
control
,
however
he
might
secretly
feel
on
some
matters
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Polly
,
"
he
said
,
looking
down
on
his
little
girl
,
"
go
into
the
hall
;
you
will
see
papa
's
great
-
coat
lying
on
a
chair
;
put
your
hand
into
the
pockets
,
you
will
find
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
there
;
bring
it
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
obeyed
;
went
and
returned
deftly
and
nimbly
.
<EOS>
He
was
talking
to
Mrs.
Bretton
when
she
came
back
,
and
she
waited
with
the
handkerchief
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
picture
,
in
its
way
,
to
see
her
,
with
her
tiny
stature
,
and
trim
,
neat
shape
,
standing
at
his
knee
.
<EOS>
Seeing
that
he
continued
to
talk
,
apparently
unconscious
of
her
return
,
she
took
his
hand
,
opened
the
unresisting
fingers
,
insinuated
into
them
the
handkerchief
,
and
closed
them
upon
it
one
by
one
.
<EOS>
He
still
seemed
not
to
see
or
to
feel
her
;
but
by
-
and
-
by
,
he
lifted
her
to
his
knee
;
she
nestled
against
him
,
and
though
neither
looked
at
nor
spoke
to
the
other
for
an
hour
following
,
I
suppose
both
were
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
During
tea
,
the
minute
thing
's
movements
and
behaviour
gave
,
as
usual
,
full
occupation
to
the
eye
.
<EOS>
First
she
directed
Warren
,
as
he
placed
the
chairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Put
papa
's
chair
here
,
and
mine
near
it
,
between
papa
and
Mrs.
Bretton
<EOS>
:
_
I
_
must
hand
his
tea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
took
her
own
seat
,
and
beckoned
with
her
hand
to
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
Be
near
me
,
as
if
we
were
at
home
,
papa
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
again
,
as
she
intercepted
his
cup
in
passing
,
and
would
stir
the
sugar
,
and
put
in
the
cream
herself
,
"
I
always
did
it
for
you
at
home
;
papa
:
<EOS>
nobody
could
do
it
as
well
,
not
even
your
own
self
.
"
  
<EOS>
Throughout
the
meal
she
continued
her
attentions
:
rather
absurd
they
were
.
<EOS>
The
sugar
-
tongs
were
too
wide
for
one
of
her
hands
,
and
she
had
to
use
both
in
wielding
them
;
the
weight
of
the
silver
cream
-
ewer
,
the
bread
-
and
-
butter
plates
,
the
very
cup
and
saucer
,
tasked
her
insufficient
strength
and
dexterity
;
but
she
would
lift
this
,
hand
that
,
and
luckily
contrived
through
it
all
to
break
nothing
.
<EOS>
Candidly
speaking
,
I
thought
her
a
little
busy
-
body
;
but
her
father
,
blind
like
other
parents
,
seemed
perfectly
content
to
let
her
wait
on
him
,
and
even
wonderfully
soothed
by
her
offices
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
my
comfort
!
"
<EOS>
he
could
not
help
saying
to
Mrs.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
That
lady
had
her
own
"
comfort
"
and
nonpareil
on
a
much
larger
scale
,
and
,
for
the
moment
,
absent
;
so
she
sympathised
with
his
foible
.
  
<EOS>
This
second
"
comfort
"
came
on
the
stage
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
I
knew
this
day
had
been
fixed
for
his
return
,
and
was
aware
that
Mrs.
Bretton
had
been
expecting
him
through
all
its
hours
.
<EOS>
We
were
seated
round
the
fire
,
after
tea
,
when
Graham
joined
our
circle
:
I
should
rather
say
,
broke
it
up
 
for
,
of
course
,
his
arrival
made
a
bustle
;
and
then
,
as
Mr.
Graham
was
fasting
,
there
was
refreshment
to
be
provided
.
<EOS>
He
and
Mr.
Home
met
as
old
acquaintance
;
of
the
little
girl
he
took
no
notice
for
a
time
.
  
<EOS>
His
meal
over
,
and
numerous
questions
from
his
mother
answered
,
he
turned
from
the
table
to
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
Opposite
where
he
had
placed
himself
was
seated
Mr.
Home
,
and
at
his
elbow
,
the
child
.
<EOS>
When
I
say
_
child
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
use
an
inappropriate
and
undescriptive
term
 
a
term
suggesting
any
picture
rather
than
that
of
the
demure
little
person
in
a
mourning
frock
and
white
chemisette
,
that
might
just
have
fitted
a
good
-
sized
doll
 
perched
now
on
a
high
chair
beside
a
stand
,
whereon
was
her
toy
work
-
box
of
white
varnished
wood
,
and
holding
in
her
hands
a
shred
of
a
handkerchief
,
which
she
was
professing
to
hem
,
and
at
which
she
bored
perseveringly
with
a
needle
,
that
in
her
fingers
seemed
almost
a
skewer
,
pricking
herself
ever
and
anon
,
marking
the
cambric
with
a
track
of
minute
red
dots
;
occasionally
starting
when
the
perverse
weapon
 
<EOS>
swerving
from
her
control
 
inflicted
a
deeper
stab
than
usual
;
but
still
silent
,
diligent
,
absorbed
,
womanly
.
  
<EOS>
Graham
was
at
that
time
a
handsome
,
faithless
-
looking
youth
of
sixteen
.
<EOS>
I
say
faithless
-
looking
,
not
because
he
was
really
of
a
very
perfidious
disposition
,
but
because
the
epithet
strikes
me
as
proper
to
describe
the
fair
,
Celtic
(
not
Saxon
)
character
of
his
good
looks
;
his
waved
light
auburn
hair
,
his
supple
symmetry
,
his
smile
frequent
,
and
destitute
neither
of
fascination
nor
of
subtlety
(
in
no
bad
sense
)
.
<EOS>
A
spoiled
,
whimsical
boy
<EOS>
he
was
in
those
days
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
he
said
,
after
eyeing
the
little
figure
before
him
in
silence
for
some
time
,
and
when
the
temporary
absence
of
Mr.
Home
from
the
room
relieved
him
from
the
half
-
laughing
bashfulness
,
which
was
all
he
knew
of
timidity
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
I
see
a
young
lady
in
the
present
society
to
whom
I
have
not
been
introduced
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Home
's
little
girl
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
you
mean
,
"
said
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
her
son
,
"
I
consider
your
expression
of
the
least
ceremonious
:
<EOS>
Miss
Home
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
should
certainly
have
said
,
in
venturing
to
speak
of
the
gentlewoman
to
whom
I
allude
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Now
,
Graham
,
I
will
not
have
that
child
teased
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
flatter
yourself
that
I
shall
suffer
you
to
make
her
your
butt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Home
,
"
pursued
Graham
,
undeterred
by
his
mother
's
remonstrance
,
"
might
I
have
the
honour
to
introduce
myself
,
since
no
one
else
seems
willing
to
render
you
and
me
that
service
?
<EOS>
Your
slave
,
John
Graham
Bretton
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
;
he
rose
and
bowed
quite
gravely
.
<EOS>
She
deliberately
put
down
thimble
,
scissors
,
work
;
descended
with
precaution
from
her
perch
,
and
curtsying
with
unspeakable
seriousness
,
said
,
"
How
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
honour
to
be
in
fair
health
,
only
in
some
measure
fatigued
with
a
hurried
journey
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
ma'am
,
I
see
you
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tor
-
rer
-
ably
well
,
"
was
the
ambitious
reply
of
the
little
woman
and
she
now
essayed
to
regain
her
former
elevation
,
but
finding
this
could
not
be
done
without
some
climbing
and
straining
 
a
sacrifice
of
decorum
not
to
be
thought
of
 
and
being
utterly
disdainful
of
aid
in
the
presence
of
a
strange
young
gentleman
,
she
relinquished
the
high
chair
for
a
low
stool
:
towards
that
low
stool
Graham
drew
in
his
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
ma'am
,
the
present
residence
,
my
mother
's
house
,
appears
to
you
a
convenient
place
of
abode
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
par
-
tic
-
er
-
er
-
ly
;
I
want
to
go
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
natural
and
laudable
desire
,
ma'am
;
but
one
which
,
notwithstanding
,
I
shall
do
my
best
to
oppose
.
<EOS>
I
reckon
on
being
able
to
get
out
of
you
a
little
of
that
precious
commodity
called
amusement
,
which
mamma
and
Mistress
Snowe
<EOS>
there
fail
to
yield
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
to
go
with
papa
soon
:
I
shall
not
stay
long
at
your
mother

"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
;
you
will
stay
with
me

I
am
sure

<EOS>
I
have
a

no

of
books

pictures
to
show
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
_
you
_
going
to
live
here
now

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am

<EOS>
Does
that
please

<EOS>
Do
you
like

"
  
<EOS>
"
No

"
  
<EOS>
"
Why

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
queer

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
face
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
face
and
all
about
you
:
You
have
long
red
hair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Auburn
hair
,
if
you
please
:
mamma
,
calls
it
auburn
,
or
golden
,
and
so
do
all
her
friends
.
<EOS>
But
even
with
my
"
long
red
hair
"
"
<EOS>
(
and
he
waved
his
mane
with
a
sort
of
triumph
 
<EOS>
tawny
he
himself
<EOS>
well
knew
that
it
was
,
and
he
was
proud
of
the
leonine
hue
)
<EOS>
,
"
I
can
not
possibly
be
queerer
than
is
your

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
call
me
queer
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
After
a
pause
)
,
"
I
think
I
shall
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
little
thing
like
you
ought
to
have
been
in
bed
<EOS>
many
hours
since
<EOS>
;
but
you
probably
sat
up
in
the
expectation
of
seeing
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
certainly
wished
to
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
my
society
.
<EOS>
You
knew
I
was
coming
home
,
and
would
wait
to
have
a
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
sat
up
for
papa
,
and
not
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
Miss
Home
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
be
a
favourite
:
preferred
before
papa
soon
,
I
daresay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
wished
Mrs.
Bretton
and
myself
good
-
night
;
she
seemed
hesitating
whether
Graham
's
deserts
entitled
him
to
the
same
attention
,
when
he
caught
her
up
with
one
hand
,
and
with
that
one
hand
held
her
poised
aloft
above
his
head
.
<EOS>
She
saw
herself
thus
lifted
up
on
high
,
in
the
glass
over
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
The
suddenness
,
the
freedom
,
the
disrespect
of
the
action
were
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
shame
,
Mr.
Graham
!
<EOS>
"
was
her
indignant
cry
,
"
put
me
down
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
when
again
on
her
feet
,
"
I
wonder
what
you
would
think
of
me
if
I
were
to
treat
you
in
that
way
,
lifting
you
with
my
hand
"
(
raising
that
mighty
member
)
"
as
Warren
lifts
the
little
cat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
departed
.
    
<EOS>
THE
PLAYMATES
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Home
stayed
two
days
.
<EOS>
During
his
visit
he
could
not
be
prevailed
on
to
go
out
:
he
sat
all
day
long
by
the
fireside
,
sometimes
silent
,
sometimes
receiving
and
answering
Mrs.
Bretton
's
chat
,
which
was
just
of
the
proper
sort
for
a
man
in
his
morbid
mood
 
not
over
-
sympathetic
,
yet
not
too
uncongenial
,
sensible
;
and
even
with
a
touch
of
the
motherly
 
<EOS>
she
was
sufficiently
his
senior
to
be
permitted
this
touch
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
Paulina
,
the
child
was
at
once
happy
and
mute
,
busy
and
watchful
.
<EOS>
Her
father
frequently
lifted
her
to
his
knee
;
she
would
sit
there
till
she
felt
or
fancied
he
grew
restless
;
then
it
was
 
"
Papa
,
put
me
down
;
I
shall
tire
you
with
my
weight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
the
mighty
burden
slid
to
the
rug
,
and
establishing
itself
on
carpet
or
stool
just
at
"
papa
's
"
feet
,
the
white
work
-
box
and
the
scarlet
-
speckled
handkerchief
came
into
play
.
<EOS>
This
handkerchief
,
it
seems
,
was
intended
as
a
keepsake
for
"
papa
,
"
and
must
be
finished
before
his
departure
;
consequently
the
demand
on
the
sempstress
's
industry
(
she
accomplished
about
a
score
of
stitches
in
half
-
an
-
hour
)
was
stringent
.
  
<EOS>
The
evening
,
by
restoring
Graham
to
the
maternal
roof
(
his
days
were
passed
at
school
)
,
brought
us
an
accession
of
animation
 
<EOS>
a
quality
not
diminished
by
the
nature
of
the
scenes
pretty
sure
to
be
enacted
between
him
and
Miss
Paulina
.
  
<EOS>
A
distant
and
haughty
demeanour
had
been
the
result
of
the
indignity
put
upon
her
the
first
evening
of
his
arrival
:
<EOS>
her
usual
answer
,
when
he
addressed
her
,
was
 
"
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
attend
to
you
;
I
have
other
things
to
think
about
.
"
<EOS>
Being
implored
to
state
_
<EOS>
what
_
things
:
  
"
Business
.
"
  
<EOS>
Graham
would
endeavour
to
seduce
her
attention
by
opening
his
desk
and
displaying
its
multifarious
contents
:
seals
,
bright
sticks
of
wax
,
pen
-
knives
,
with
a
miscellany
of
engravings
 
<EOS>
some
of
them
gaily
coloured
 
which
he
had
amassed
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
powerful
temptation
wholly
unavailing
:
<EOS>
her
eyes
,
furtively
raised
from
her
work
,
cast
many
a
peep
towards
the
writing
-
table
,
rich
in
scattered
pictures
.
<EOS>
An
etching
of
a
child
playing
with
a
Blenheim
spaniel
happened
to
flutter
to
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
little
dog
!
<EOS>
"
said
she
,
delighted
.
  
<EOS>
Graham
prudently
took
no
notice
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
stealing
from
her
corner
,
she
approached
to
examine
the
treasure
more
closely
.
<EOS>
The
dog
's
great
eyes
and
long
ears
,
and
the
child
's
hat
and
feathers
,
were
irresistible
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nice
picture
!
<EOS>
"
was
her
favourable
criticism
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
 
you
may
have
it
,
"
said
Graham
.
  
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
hesitate
.
<EOS>
The
wish
to
possess
was
strong
,
but
to
accept
would
be
a
compromise
of
dignity
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
She
put
it
down
and
turned
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
have
it
,
then
,
Polly
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not
,
thank
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
tell
you
what
I
will
do
with
the
picture
if
you
refuse
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
half
turned
to
listen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cut
it
into
strips
for
lighting
the
taper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Please
 
do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Graham
waxed
inexorable
on
hearing
the
pleading
tone
;
he
took
the
scissors
from
his
mother
's
work
-
basket
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
goes
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
making
a
menacing
flourish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Right
through
Fido
's
head
,
and
splitting
little
Harry
's
nose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
NO
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
Come
quickly
,
or
it
is
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
hesitated
,
lingered
,
but
complied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
will
you
have
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
as
she
stood
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
want
payment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
much
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
kiss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
the
picture
first
into
my
hand
.
"
  
<EOS>
Polly
,
as
she
said
this
,
looked
rather
faithless
in
her
turn
.
<EOS>
Graham
gave
it
.
<EOS>
She
absconded
a
debtor
,
darted
to
her
father
,
and
took
refuge
on
his
knee
.
<EOS>
Graham
rose
in
mimic
wrath
and
followed
.
<EOS>
She
buried
her
face
in
Mr.
Home
's
waistcoat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
 
papa
 
send
him
away
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
be
sent
away
,
"
said
Graham
.
  
<EOS>
With
face
still
averted
,
she
held
out
her
hand
to
keep
him
off
  
"
<EOS>
Then
,
I
shall
kiss
the
hand
,
"
said
he
;
but
that
moment
it
became
a
miniature
fist
,
and
dealt
him
payment
in
a
small
coin
that
was
not
kisses
.
  
<EOS>
Graham
 
not
failing
in
his
way
to
be
as
wily
as
his
little
playmate
 
retreated
apparently
quite
discomfited
;
he
flung
himself
on
a
sofa
,
and
resting
his
head
against
the
cushion
,
lay
like
one
in
pain
.
<EOS>
Polly
,
finding
him
silent
,
presently
peeped
at
him
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
and
face
were
covered
with
his
hands
.
<EOS>
She
turned
on
her
father
's
knee
,
and
gazed
at
her
foe
anxiously
and
long
.
<EOS>
Graham
groaned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
what
is
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
she
whispered
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
ask
him
,
Polly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
hurt
?
"
<EOS>
(
groan
second
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
He
makes
a
noise
as
if
he
were
,
"
said
Mr.
Home
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
suggested
Graham
,
feebly
,
"
I
think
you
had
better
send
for
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
Oh
my
eye
!
"
<EOS>
(
renewed
silence
,
broken
only
by
sighs
from
Graham
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
to
become
blind
 
?
"
suggested
this
last
.
  
<EOS>
His
chastiser
could
not
bear
the
suggestion
.
<EOS>
She
was
beside
him
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
your
eye
:
I
did
not
mean
to
touch
it
,
only
your
mouth
;
and
I
did
not
think
I
hit
so
_
very
_
hard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Silence
answered
her
.
<EOS>
Her
features
worked
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
;
I
am
sorry
!
"
  
<EOS>
Then
succeeded
emotion
,
faltering
;
weeping
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
done
trying
that
child
,
Graham
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bretton
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
nonsense
,
my
pet
,
"
cried
Mr.
Home
.
  
<EOS>
And
Graham
once
more
snatched
her
aloft
,
and
she
again
punished
him
;
and
while
she
pulled
his
lion
's
locks
,
termed
him
 
"
The
naughtiest
,
rudest
,
worst
,
untruest
person
that
ever
was
.
"
     
<EOS>
On
the
morning
of
Mr.
Home
's
departure
,
he
and
his
daughter
had
some
conversation
in
a
window
-
recess
by
themselves
;
I
heard
part
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Could
n't
I
pack
my
box
and
go
with
you
,
papa
?
"
<EOS>
she
whispered
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Should
I
be
a
trouble
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Polly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Because
I
am
little
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
you
are
little
and
tender
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
great
,
strong
people
that
should
travel
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
look
sad
,
my
little
girl
;
it
breaks
my
heart
.
<EOS>
Papa
,
will
soon
come
back
to
his
Polly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Indeed
,
indeed
,
I
am
not
sad
,
scarcely
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Polly
would
be
sorry
to
give
papa
pain
;
<EOS>
would
she
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sorrier
than
sorry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
Polly
must
be
cheerful
<EOS>
:
not
cry
at
parting
;
not
fret
afterwards
.
<EOS>
She
must
look
forward
to
meeting
again
,
and
try
to
be
happy
meanwhile
.
<EOS>
Can
she
do
this
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
try
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
she
will
.
<EOS>
Farewell
,
then
.
<EOS>
It
is
time
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
Now
_
?
 
<EOS>
just
_
now
_
?
  
<EOS>
"
Just
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
held
up
quivering
lips
.
<EOS>
Her
father
sobbed
,
but
she
,
I
remarked
,
did
not
.
<EOS>
Having
put
her
down
,
he
shook
hands
with
the
rest
present
,
and
departed
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
street
-
door
closed
,
she
dropped
on
her
knees
at
a
chair
with
a
cry
 
"
Papa
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
low
and
long
;
a
sort
of
"
Why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
During
an
ensuing
space
of
some
minutes
,
I
perceived
she
endured
agony
.
<EOS>
She
went
through
,
in
that
brief
interval
of
her
infant
life
,
emotions
such
as
some
never
feel
;
it
was
in
her
constitution
:
she
would
have
more
of
such
instants
if
she
lived
.
<EOS>
Nobody
spoke
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
,
being
a
mother
,
shed
a
tear
or
two
.
<EOS>
Graham
,
who
was
writing
,
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
gazed
at
her
.
<EOS>
I
,
Lucy
Snowe
,
was
calm
.
  
<EOS>
The
little
creature
,
thus
left
unharassed
,
did
for
herself
what
none
other
could
do
 
contended
with
an
intolerable
feeling
;
and
,
ere
long
,
in
some
degree
,
repressed
it
.
<EOS>
That
day
she
would
accept
solace
from
none
;
nor
the
next
day
:
she
grew
more
passive
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
third
evening
,
as
she
sat
on
the
floor
,
worn
and
quiet
,
Graham
,
coming
in
,
took
her
up
gently
,
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
resist
:
she
rather
nestled
in
his
arms
,
as
if
weary
.
<EOS>
When
he
sat
down
,
she
laid
her
head
against
him
;
in
a
few
minutes
she
slept
;
he
carried
her
upstairs
to
bed
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
surprised
that
,
the
next
morning
,
the
first
thing
she
demanded
was
,
"
<EOS>
Where
is
Mr.
Graham
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
happened
that
Graham
was
not
coming
to
the
breakfast
-
table
;
he
had
some
exercises
to
write
for
that
morning
's
class
,
and
had
requested
his
mother
to
send
a
cup
of
tea
into
the
study
.
<EOS>
Polly
volunteered
to
carry
it
:
she
must
be
busy
about
something
,
look
after
somebody
.
<EOS>
The
cup
was
entrusted
to
her
;
for
,
if
restless
,
she
was
also
careful
.
<EOS>
As
the
study
was
opposite
the
breakfast
-
room
,
the
doors
facing
across
the
passage
,
my
eye
followed
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
doing
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
pausing
on
the
threshold
.
  
<EOS>
"
Writing
,
"
said
Graham
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
come
to
take
breakfast
with
your
mamma
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Too
busy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
want
any
breakfast
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Of
course
.
"
  
"
There
,
then
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
she
deposited
the
cup
on
the
carpet
,
like
a
jailor
putting
a
prisoner
's
pitcher
of
water
through
his
cell
-
door
,
and
retreated
.
<EOS>
Presently
she
returned
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
will
you
have
besides
tea
 
what
to
eat
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Anything
good
.
<EOS>
Bring
me
something
particularly
nice
;
that
's
a
kind
little
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
came
back
to
Mrs.
Bretton
.
  
<EOS>
"
Please
,
ma'am
,
send
your
boy
something
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
choose
for
him
,
Polly
;
what
shall
my
boy
have
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
selected
a
portion
of
whatever
was
best
on
the
table
;
and
,
ere
long
,
came
back
with
a
whispered
request
for
some
marmalade
,
which
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
Having
got
it
,
however
,
(
for
Mrs.
Bretton
refused
the
pair
nothing
)
,
Graham
was
shortly
after
heard
lauding
her
to
the
skies
;
promising
that
,
when
he
had
a
house
of
his
own
,
she
should
be
his
housekeeper
,
and
perhaps
 
if
she
showed
any
culinary
genius
 
his
cook
;
and
,
as
she
did
not
return
,
and
I
went
to
look
after
her
<EOS>
,
I
found
Graham
and
her
breakfasting
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
she
standing
at
his
elbow
,
and
sharing
his
fare
:
excepting
the
marmalade
,
which
she
delicately
refused
to
touch
,
lest
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
it
should
appear
that
she
had
procured
it
as
much
on
her
own
account
as
his
.
<EOS>
She
constantly
evinced
these
nice
perceptions
and
delicate
instincts
.
  
<EOS>
The
league
of
acquaintanceship
thus
struck
up
was
not
hastily
dissolved
;
on
the
contrary
,
it
appeared
that
time
and
circumstances
served
rather
to
cement
than
loosen
it
.
<EOS>
Ill
-
assimilated
as
the
two
were
in
age
,
sex
,
pursuits
,
&
c.
,
they
somehow
found
a
great
deal
to
say
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
As
to
Paulina
,
I
observed
that
her
little
character
never
properly
came
out
,
except
with
young
Bretton
.
<EOS>
As
she
got
settled
,
and
accustomed
to
the
house
,
she
proved
tractable
enough
with
Mrs.
Bretton
;
but
she
would
sit
on
a
stool
at
that
lady
's
feet
all
day
long
,
learning
her
task
,
or
sewing
,
or
drawing
figures
with
a
pencil
on
a
slate
,
and
never
kindling
once
to
originality
,
or
showing
a
single
gleam
of
the
peculiarities
of
her
nature
.
<EOS>
I
ceased
to
watch
her
under
such
circumstances
:
she
was
not
interesting
.
<EOS>
But
the
moment
Graham
's
knock
sounded
of
an
evening
,
a
change
occurred
;
she
was
instantly
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
.
<EOS>
Usually
her
welcome
was
a
reprimand
or
a
threat
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
wiped
your
shoes
properly
on
the
mat
.
<EOS>
I
shall
tell
your
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Little
busybody
!
<EOS>
Are
you
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
<EOS>
and
you
ca
n't
reach
me
<EOS>
:
I
am
higher
up
than
you
"
(
peeping
between
the
rails
of
the
banister
;
she
could
not
look
over
them
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
Polly
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
boy
!
"
<EOS>
(
such
was
one
of
her
terms
for
him
,
adopted
in
imitation
of
his
mother
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
fit
to
faint
with
fatigue
,
"
declared
Graham
,
leaning
against
the
passage
-
wall
in
seeming
exhaustion
.
"
<EOS>
Dr.
Digby
"
(
the
headmaster
)
"
has
quite
knocked
me
up
with
overwork
.
<EOS>
Just
come
down
and
help
me
to
carry
up
my
books
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
're
cunning
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
Polly
 
it
is
positive
fact
.
<EOS>
I
'm
as
weak
as
a
rush
.
<EOS>
Come
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
eyes
are
quiet
like
the
cat
's
,
but
you
'll
spring
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Spring
?
<EOS>
Nothing
of
the
kind
:
it
is
n't
in
me
.
<EOS>
Come
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
may
 
if
you
'll
promise
not
to
touch
 
not
to
snatch
me
up
,
and
not
to
whirl
me
round
.
"
  
"
I
?
<EOS>
I
could
n't
do
it
!
"
<EOS>
(
sinking
into
a
chair
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Then
put
the
books
down
on
the
first
step
,
and
go
three
yards
off
"
  
This
being
done
,
she
descended
warily
,
and
not
taking
her
eyes
from
the
feeble
Graham
.
<EOS>
Of
course
her
approach
always
galvanized
him
to
new
and
spasmodic
life
:
the
game
of
romps
was
sure
to
be
exacted
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
she
would
be
angry
;
sometimes
the
matter
was
allowed
to
pass
smoothly
,
and
we
could
hear
her
say
as
she
led
him
up
-
stairs
:
"
Now
,
my
dear
boy
,
come
and
take
your
tea
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
must
want
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
sufficiently
comical
to
observe
her
as
she
sat
beside
Graham
,
while
he
took
that
meal
.
<EOS>
In
his
absence
she
was
a
still
personage
,
but
with
him
the
most
officious
,
fidgety
little
body
possible
.
<EOS>
I
often
wished
she
would
mind
herself
and
be
tranquil
;
but
no
 
herself
was
forgotten
in
him
:
he
could
not
be
sufficiently
well
waited
on
,
nor
carefully
enough
looked
after
;
he
was
more
than
the
Grand
Turk
in
her
estimation
.
<EOS>
She
would
gradually
assemble
the
various
plates
before
him
,
and
,
when
one
would
suppose
all
he
could
possibly
desire
was
within
his
reach
,
she
would
find
out
something
else
:
"
Ma'am
,
"
she
would
whisper
to
Mrs.
Bretton
,
 
"
perhaps
your
son
would
like
a
little
cake
 
<EOS>
sweet
cake
<EOS>
,
you
know
 
there
is
some
in
there
"
(
pointing
to
the
sideboard
cupboard
)
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
,
as
a
rule
,
disapproved
of
sweet
cake
at
tea
,
but
still
the
request
was
urged
,
 
<EOS>
"
One
little
piece
 
<EOS>
only
for
him
 
as
he
goes
to
school
:
girls
 
such
as
me
and
Miss
Snowe
 
do
n't
need
treats
,
but
_
he
_
would
like
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Graham
did
like
it
very
well
,
and
almost
always
got
it
.
<EOS>
To
do
him
justice
,
he
would
have
shared
his
prize
with
her
to
whom
he
owed
it
;
but
that
was
never
allowed
:
to
insist
,
was
to
ruffle
her
for
the
evening
.
<EOS>
To
stand
by
his
knee
,
and
monopolize
his
talk
and
notice
,
was
the
reward
she
wanted
 
not
a
share
of
the
cake
.
  
<EOS>
With
curious
readiness
did
she
adapt
herself
to
such
themes
as
interested
him
.
<EOS>
One
would
have
thought
the
child
had
no
mind
or
life
of
her
own
,
but
must
necessarily
live
,
move
,
and
have
her
being
in
another
:
now
that
her
father
was
taken
from
her
,
she
nestled
to
Graham
,
and
seemed
to
feel
by
his
feelings
:
to
exist
in
his
existence
.
<EOS>
She
learned
the
names
of
all
his
schoolfellows
in
a
trice
:
she
got
by
heart
their
characters
as
given
from
his
lips
:
a
single
description
of
an
individual
seemed
to
suffice
.
<EOS>
She
never
forgot
,
or
<EOS>
confused
identities
:
she
would
talk
with
him
the
whole
evening
about
people
she
had
never
seen
,
and
appear
completely
to
realise
their
aspect
,
manners
,
and
dispositions
.
<EOS>
Some
she
learned
to
mimic
:
an
under
-
master
,
who
was
an
aversion
of
young
Bretton
's
,
had
,
it
seems
,
some
peculiarities
,
which
she
caught
up
in
a
moment
from
Graham
's
representation
,
and
rehearsed
for
his
amusement
;
this
,
however
,
Mrs.
Bretton
disapproved
and
forbade
.
  
<EOS>
The
pair
seldom
quarrelled
;
yet
once
a
rupture
occurred
,
in
which
her
feelings
received
a
severe
shock
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
Graham
,
on
the
occasion
of
his
birthday
,
had
some
friends
 
lads
of
his
own
age
 
to
dine
with
him
.
<EOS>
Paulina
took
much
interest
in
the
coming
of
these
friends
;
she
had
frequently
heard
of
them
;
they
were
amongst
those
of
whom
Graham
oftenest
spoke
.
<EOS>
After
dinner
,
the
young
gentlemen
were
left
by
themselves
in
the
dining
-
room
,
where
they
soon
became
very
merry
and
made
a
good
deal
of
noise
.
<EOS>
Chancing
to
pass
through
the
hall
,
I
found
Paulina
sitting
alone
on
the
lowest
step
of
the
staircase
,
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
glossy
panels
of
the
dining
-
room
door
,
where
the
reflection
of
the
hall
-
lamp
was
shining
;
her
little
brow
knit
in
anxious
,
meditation
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
thinking
about
,
Polly
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nothing
particular
<EOS>
;
only
I
wish
that
door
was
clear
glass
 
<EOS>
that
I
might
see
through
it
.
<EOS>
The
boys
seem
very
cheerful
,
and
I
want
to
go
to
them
:
I
want
to
be
with
Graham
,
and
watch
his
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
hinders
you
from
going
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
afraid
:
but
may
I
try
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
May
I
knock
at
the
door
,
and
ask
to
be
let
in
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
perhaps
they
might
not
object
to
have
her
as
a
playmate
,
and
therefore
encouraged
the
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
She
knocked
 
too
faintly
at
first
to
be
heard
,
but
on
a
second
essay
the
door
unclosed
;
Graham
's
head
appeared
;
he
looked
in
high
spirits
,
but
impatient
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
,
<EOS>
you
little
monkey
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
come
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
indeed
?
<EOS>
As
if
I
would
be
troubled
with
you
!
<EOS>
Away
to
mamma
and
Mistress
Snowe
,
and
tell
them
to
put
you
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
auburn
head
and
bright
flushed
face
vanished
,
 
the
door
shut
peremptorily
.
<EOS>
She
was
stunned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
does
he
speak
so
?
<EOS>
He
never
spoke
so
before
,
"
she
said
in
consternation
.
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
done
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
Polly
;
but
Graham
is
busy
with
his
school
-
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
likes
them
better
than
me
!
<EOS>
He
turns
me
away
now
they
are
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
some
thoughts
of
consoling
her
,
and
of
improving
the
occasion
by
inculcating
some
of
those
maxims
of
philosophy
<EOS>
whereof
I
had
ever
a
tolerable
stock
ready
for
application
.
<EOS>
She
stopped
me
,
however
,
by
putting
her
fingers
in
her
ears
at
the
first
words
I
uttered
,
and
then
lying
down
on
the
mat
with
her
face
against
the
flags
;
nor
could
either
Warren
or
the
cook
root
her
from
that
position
:
she
was
allowed
to
lie
,
therefore
,
till
she
chose
to
rise
of
her
own
accord
.
  
<EOS>
Graham
forgot
his
impatience
the
same
evening
,
and
would
have
accosted
her
as
usual
when
his
friends
were
gone
,
but
she
wrenched
herself
from
his
hand
;
her
eye
quite
flashed
;
she
would
not
bid
him
good
-
night
;
she
would
not
look
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
he
treated
her
with
indifference
,
and
she
grew
like
a
bit
of
marble
.
<EOS>
The
day
after
,
he
teased
her
to
know
what
was
the
matter
;
her
lips
would
not
unclose
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
could
not
feel
real
anger
on
his
side
:
the
match
was
too
unequal
in
every
way
;
he
tried
soothing
and
coaxing
.
<EOS>
"
Why
was
she
so
angry
?
<EOS>
What
had
he
done
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
tears
answered
him
;
he
petted
her
,
and
they
were
friends
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
one
on
whom
such
incidents
were
not
lost
<EOS>
:
I
remarked
that
never
after
this
rebuff
did
she
seek
him
,
or
follow
him
,
or
in
any
way
solicit
his
notice
.
<EOS>
I
told
her
once
to
carry
a
book
or
some
other
article
to
Graham
when
he
was
shut
up
in
his
study
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
wait
till
he
comes
out
,
"
said
she
,
proudly
;
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
choose
to
give
him
the
trouble
of
rising
to
open
the
door
.
"
  
<EOS>
Young
Bretton
had
a
favourite
pony
on
which
he
often
rode
out
;
from
the
window
she
always
watched
his
departure
and
return
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
ambition
to
be
permitted
to
have
a
ride
round
the
courtyard
on
this
pony
;
but
far
be
it
from
her
to
ask
such
a
favour
.
<EOS>
One
day
she
descended
to
the
yard
to
watch
him
dismount
;
as
she
leaned
against
the
gate
,
the
longing
wish
for
the
indulgence
of
a
ride
glittered
in
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Polly
,
will
you
have
a
canter
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Graham
,
half
carelessly
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
thought
he
was
_
too
_
careless
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
,
"
said
she
,
turning
away
with
the
utmost
coolness
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
,
"
pursued
he
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
like
it
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
think
I
should
care
a
fig
about
it
,
"
was
the
response
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
true
.
<EOS>
You
told
Lucy
Snowe
you
longed
to
have
a
ride
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
Snowe
is
a
_
tatter_-box
,
"
I
heard
her
say
(
her
imperfect
articulation
was
the
least
precocious
thing
she
had
about
her
)
;
and
with
this
;
she
walked
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Graham
,
coming
in
soon
after
,
observed
to
his
mother
,
 
"
Mamma
,
I
believe
that
creature
is
a
changeling
:
she
is
a
perfect
cabinet
of
oddities
;
but
I
should
be
dull
without
her
:
she
amuses
me
a
great
deal
more
than
you
or
Lucy
Snowe
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
Miss
Snowe
,
"
said
Paulina
to
me
(
she
had
now
got
into
the
habit
of
occasionally
chatting
with
me
when
we
were
alone
in
our
room
at
night
)
,
"
do
you
know
on
what
day
in
the
week
I
like
Graham
best
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
possibly
know
anything
so
strange
?
<EOS>
Is
there
one
day
out
of
the
seven
when
he
is
otherwise
than
on
the
other
six
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
be
sure
!
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
see
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
?
<EOS>
I
find
him
the
most
excellent
on
a
Sunday
;
then
we
have
him
the
whole
day
,
and
he
is
quiet
,
and
,
in
the
evening
,
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
so
_
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
observation
was
not
altogether
groundless
:
going
to
church
,
&
c.
,
kept
Graham
quiet
on
the
Sunday
,
and
the
evening
he
generally
dedicated
to
a
serene
,
though
rather
indolent
sort
of
enjoyment
by
the
parlour
fireside
.
<EOS>
He
would
take
possession
of
the
couch
,
and
then
he
would
call
Polly
.
  
<EOS>
Graham
was
a
boy
not
quite
as
other
boys
are
;
all
his
delight
did
not
lie
in
action
:
he
was
capable
of
some
intervals
of
contemplation
;
he
could
take
a
pleasure
too
in
reading
,
nor
was
his
selection
of
books
<EOS>
wholly
indiscriminate
<EOS>
:
there
were
glimmerings
of
characteristic
preference
,
and
even
of
instinctive
taste
in
the
choice
.
<EOS>
He
rarely
,
it
is
true
,
remarked
on
what
he
read
,
but
I
have
seen
him
sit
and
think
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Polly
,
being
near
him
,
kneeling
on
a
little
cushion
or
the
carpet
,
a
conversation
would
begin
in
murmurs
,
not
inaudible
,
though
subdued
.
<EOS>
I
caught
a
snatch
of
their
tenor
now
and
then
;
and
,
in
truth
,
some
influence
better
and
finer
than
that
of
every
day
,
seemed
to
soothe
Graham
at
such
times
into
no
ungentle
mood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
learned
any
hymns
this
week
,
Polly
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
learned
a
very
pretty
one
,
four
verses
long
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
say
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
nicely
,
then
:
do
n't
be
in
a
hurry
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
hymn
being
rehearsed
,
or
rather
half
-
chanted
,
in
a
little
singing
voice
,
Graham
would
take
exceptions
at
the
manner
,
and
proceed
to
give
a
lesson
in
recitation
.
<EOS>
She
was
quick
in
learning
,
apt
in
imitating
;
and
,
besides
,
her
pleasure
was
to
please
Graham
<EOS>
:
she
proved
a
ready
scholar
.
<EOS>
To
the
hymn
would
succeed
some
reading
 
perhaps
a
chapter
in
the
Bible
;
correction
was
seldom
required
here
,
for
the
child
could
read
any
simple
narrative
chapter
very
well
;
and
,
when
the
subject
was
such
as
she
could
understand
and
take
an
interest
in
,
her
expression
and
emphasis
were
something
remarkable
.
<EOS>
Joseph
cast
into
the
pit
;
the
calling
of
Samuel
;
Daniel
in
the
lions
'
den
;
 
these
were
favourite
passages
:
of
the
first
<EOS>
especially
she
seemed
perfectly
to
feel
the
pathos
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Jacob
!
<EOS>
"
she
would
sometimes
say
,
with
quivering
lips
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
he
loved
his
son
Joseph
!
<EOS>
As
much
,
"
she
once
added
 
"
as
much
,
<EOS>
Graham
,
as
I
love
you
:
if
you
were
to
die
"
(
and
she
re
-
opened
the
book
,
sought
the
verse
,
and
read
)
,
"
I
should
refuse
to
be
comforted
,
and
go
down
into
the
grave
to
you
mourning
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
these
words
she
gathered
Graham
in
her
little
arms
,
drawing
his
long
-
tressed
head
towards
her
.
<EOS>
The
action
,
I
remember
,
struck
me
as
strangely
rash
;
exciting
the
feeling
one
might
experience
on
seeing
an
animal
dangerous
by
nature
,
and
but
half
-
tamed
by
art
,
too
heedlessly
fondled
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
feared
Graham
would
hurt
,
or
very
roughly
check
her
;
but
I
thought
she
ran
risk
of
incurring
such
a
careless
,
impatient
repulse
,
as
would
be
worse
almost
to
her
than
a
blow
.
<EOS>
On
:
the
whole
,
however
,
these
demonstrations
were
borne
passively
:
sometimes
even
a
sort
of
complacent
wonder
at
her
earnest
partiality
would
smile
not
unkindly
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
Once
he
said
:
 
"
You
like
me
almost
as
well
as
if
you
were
my
little
sister
,
Polly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
_
do
_
like
you
,
"
said
she
;
"
I
_
do
_
like
you
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
not
long
allowed
the
amusement
of
this
study
of
character
.
<EOS>
She
had
scarcely
been
at
Bretton
two
months
,
when
a
letter
came
from
Mr.
Home
,
signifying
that
he
was
now
settled
amongst
his
maternal
kinsfolk
on
the
Continent
;
that
,
as
England
was
become
wholly
distasteful
to
him
,
he
had
no
thoughts
of
returning
hither
,
perhaps
,
for
years
;
and
that
he
wished
his
little
girl
to
join
him
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
how
she
will
take
this
news
?
"
said
Mrs.
Bretton
,
when
she
had
read
the
letter
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
wondered
,
too
,
and
I
took
upon
myself
to
communicate
it
.
  
<EOS>
Repairing
to
the
drawing
-
room
 
in
which
calm
and
decorated
apartment
<EOS>
she
was
fond
of
being
alone
,
and
where
she
could
be
implicitly
trusted
,
for
she
fingered
nothing
,
or
rather
soiled
nothing
she
fingered
 
<EOS>
I
found
her
seated
,
like
a
little
Odalisque
,
on
a
couch
,
half
shaded
by
the
drooping
draperies
of
the
window
near
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
happy
;
all
her
appliances
for
occupation
were
about
her
;
the
white
wood
workbox
,
a
shred
or
two
of
muslin
,
an
end
or
two
of
ribbon
collected
for
conversion
into
doll
-
millinery
.
<EOS>
The
doll
,
duly
night
-
capped
and
night
-
gowned
,
lay
in
its
cradle
;
she
was
rocking
it
to
sleep
,
with
an
air
of
the
most
perfect
faith
in
its
possession
of
sentient
and
somnolent
faculties
;
her
eyes
,
at
the
same
time
,
being
engaged
with
a
picture
-
book
,
which
lay
open
on
her
lap
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Snowe
,
"
said
she
in
a
whisper
,
"
this
is
a
wonderful
book
.
<EOS>
Candace
"
(
the
doll
,
christened
by
Graham
;
for
,
indeed
,
its
begrimed
complexion
gave
it
much
of
an
Ethiopian
aspect
)
 
<EOS>
"
Candace
is
asleep
now
,
and
I
may
tell
you
about
it
;
only
we
must
both
speak
low
,
lest
she
should
waken
.
<EOS>
This
book
was
given
me
by
Graham
;
it
tells
about
distant
countries
,
a
long
,
long
way
from
England
,
which
no
traveller
can
reach
without
sailing
thousands
of
miles
over
the
sea
.
<EOS>
Wild
men
live
in
these
countries
,
Miss
Snowe
,
who
wear
clothes
different
from
ours
:
<EOS>
indeed
,
some
of
them
wear
scarcely
any
clothes
,
for
the
sake
of
being
cool
,
you
know
;
for
they
have
very
hot
weather
.
<EOS>
Here
is
a
picture
of
thousands
gathered
in
a
desolate
place
 
<EOS>
a
plain
,
spread
with
sand
 
round
a
man
in
black
,

<EOS>
(
She
showed
a
little
coloured
cut
to
that
effect
.
)
<EOS>
"
And
here
are
pictures
"
<EOS>
(
she
went
on
)
<EOS>
"
more
stranger
"
(
grammar
was
occasionally
forgotten
)
"
than
that

<EOS>
There
is
the
wonderful
Great
Wall
of
China
;
here
is
a
Chinese
lady
,
with
a
foot
littler
than
mine
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
wild
horse
of
Tartary
;
and
here
,
most
strange
of
all
 
is
a
land
of
ice
and
snow
,
without
green
fields
,
woods
,
or
gardens

<EOS>
In
this
land
,
they
found
some
mammoth
bones
:
there
are
no
mammoths
now
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
what
it
was
;
but
I
can
tell
you
,
because
Graham
told
me
.
<EOS>
A
mighty
,
goblin
creature
,
as
high
as
this
room
,
and
as
long
as
the
hall
;
but
not
a
fierce
,
flesh
-
eating
thing
,
Graham
thinks
.
<EOS>
He
believes
,
if
I
met
one
in
a
forest
,
it
would
not
kill
me
,
unless
I
came
quite
in
its
way
;
when
it
would
trample
me
down
amongst
the
bushes
,
as
I
might
tread
on
a
grasshopper
in
a
hayfield
without
knowing
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thus
she
rambled
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Polly
,
"
I
interrupted
,
"
should
you
like
to
travel
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
just
yet
,
"
was
the
prudent
answer
;
"
but
perhaps
in
twenty
years
,
when
I
am
grown
a
woman
,
as
tall
as
Mrs.
Bretton
,
I
may
travel
with
Graham
.
<EOS>
We
intend
going
to
Switzerland
,
and
climbing
Mount
Blanck
;
and
some
day
we
shall
sail
over
to
South
America
,
and
walk
to
the
top
of
Kim
-
kim
-
borazo
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
how
would
you
like
to
travel
now
,
if
your
papa
was
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
reply
 
not
given
till
after
a
pause
 
evinced
one
of
those
unexpected
turns
of
temper
peculiar
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
good
of
talking
in
that
silly
way
?
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
mention
papa
?
<EOS>
What
is
papa
to
you
?
<EOS>
I
was
just
beginning
to
be
happy
,
and
not
think
about
him
so
much
;
and
there
it
will
be
all
to
do
over
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
Her
lip
trembled
.
<EOS>
I
hastened
to
disclose
the
fact
of
a
letter
having
been
received
,
and
to
mention
the
directions
given
that
she
and
Harriet
should
immediately
rejoin
this
dear
papa
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
Polly
,
are
you
not
glad
?
"
<EOS>
I
added
.
  
<EOS>
She
made
no
answer
.
<EOS>
She
dropped
her
book
and
ceased
to
rock
her
doll
;
she
gazed
at
me
with
gravity
and
earnestness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
not
you
like
to
go
to
papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
she
said
at
last
in
that
trenchant
manner
she
usually
employed
in
speaking
to
me
;
and
which
was
quite
different
from
that
she
used
with
Mrs.
Bretton
,
and
different
again
from
the
one
dedicated
to
Graham
.
<EOS>
I
wished
to
ascertain
more
of
what
she
thought
<EOS>
but
no
:
<EOS>
she
would
converse
no
more
.
<EOS>
Hastening
to
Mrs.
Bretton
,
she
questioned
her
,
and
received
the
confirmation
of
my
news
.
<EOS>
The
weight
and
importance
of
these
tidings
kept
her
perfectly
serious
the
whole
day
.
<EOS>
In
the
evening
,
at
the
moment
Graham
's
entrance
was
heard
below
,
I
found
her
at
my
side
.
<EOS>
She
began
to
arrange
a
locket
-
ribbon
about
my
neck
,
she
displaced
and
replaced
the
comb
in
my
hair
;
while
thus
busied
,
Graham
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
by
-
and
-
by
,
"
she
whispered
;
"
tell
him
I
am
going
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
tea
-
time
I
made
the
desired
communication
.
<EOS>
Graham
,
it
chanced
,
was
at
that
time
greatly
preoccupied
about
some
school
-
prize
,
for
which
he
was
competing
.
<EOS>
The
news
had
to
be
told
twice
before
it
took
proper
hold
of
his
attention
,
and
even
then
he
dwelt
on
it
but
momently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Polly
going
?
<EOS>
What
a
pity
!
<EOS>
Dear
little
Mousie
,
I
shall
be
sorry
to
lose
her
<EOS>
:
she
must
come
to
us
again
,
mamma
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
hastily
swallowing
his
tea
,
he
took
a
candle
and
a
small
table
to
himself
and
his
books
,
and
was
soon
buried
in
study
.
  
<EOS>
"
Little
Mousie
"
crept
to
his
side
,
and
lay
down
on
the
carpet
at
his
feet
,
her
face
to
the
floor
;
mute
and
motionless
she
kept
that
post
and
position
till
bed
-
time
.
<EOS>
Once
I
saw
Graham
 
wholly
unconscious
of
her
proximity
 
push
her
with
his
restless
foot
.
<EOS>
She
receded
an
inch
or
two
.
<EOS>
A
minute
after
one
little
hand
stole
out
from
beneath
her
face
,
to
which
it
had
been
pressed
,
and
softly
caressed
the
heedless
foot
.
<EOS>
When
summoned
by
her
nurse
she
rose
and
departed
very
obediently
,
having
bid
us
all
a
subdued
good
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
I
dreaded
going
to
bed
,
an
hour
later
;
yet
I
certainly
went
with
an
unquiet
anticipation
that
I
should
find
that
child
in
no
peaceful
sleep
.
<EOS>
The
forewarning
of
my
instinct
was
but
fulfilled
,
when
I
discovered
her
,
all
cold
and
vigilant
,
perched
like
a
white
bird
on
the
outside
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
I
scarcely
knew
how
to
accost
her
;
she
was
not
to
be
managed
like
another
child
.
<EOS>
She
,
however
,
accosted
me
.
<EOS>
As
I
closed
the
door
,
and
put
the
light
on
the
dressing
-
table
,
she
turned
tome
with
these
words
:
 
"
I
can
not
 
_
can
not
_
sleep
;
and
in
this
way
I
can
not
 
_
can
not
_
live
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
asked
what
ailed
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dedful
miz
-
er
-
y
!
<EOS>
"
said
she
,
with
her
piteous
lisp
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
call
Mrs.
Bretton
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
downright
silly
,
"
was
her
impatient
reply
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
well
knew
that
if
she
had
heard
Mrs.
Bretton
's
foot
approach
,
she
would
have
nestled
quiet
as
a
mouse
under
the
bedclothes
.
<EOS>
Whilst
lavishing
her
eccentricities
regardlessly
before
me
 
for
whom
she
professed
scarcely
the
semblance
of
affection
 
she
never
showed
my
godmother
one
glimpse
of
her
inner
self
:
for
her
,
she
was
nothing
but
a
docile
,
somewhat
quaint
<EOS>
little
maiden
.
<EOS>
I
examined
her
;
her
cheek
was
crimson
;
her
dilated
eye
was
both
troubled
and
glowing
,
and
painfully
restless
:
in
this
state
it
was
obvious
she
must
not
be
left
till
morning
.
<EOS>
I
guessed
how
the
case
stood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
to
bid
Graham
good
-
night
again
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
gone
to
his
room
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
at
once
stretched
out
her
little
arms
to
be
lifted
.
<EOS>
Folding
a
shawl
round
her
,
I
carried
her
back
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Graham
was
just
coming
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
can
not
sleep
without
seeing
and
speaking
to
you
once
more
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
She
does
not
like
the
thought
of
leaving
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
spoilt
her
,
"
said
he
,
taking
her
from
me
with
good
humour
,
and
kissing
her
little
hot
face
and
burning
lips
.
<EOS>
"
Polly
,
you
care
for
me
more
than
for
papa
,
now
 
"
  
"
I
_
do
_
care
for
you
,
but
you
care
nothing
for
me
,
"
was
her
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
assured
to
the
contrary
,
again
kissed
,
restored
to
me
,
and
I
carried
her
away
;
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
not
soothed
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
thought
she
could
listen
to
me
,
I
said
 
"
Paulina
,
you
should
not
grieve
that
Graham
does
not
care
for
you
so
much
as
you
care
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
lifted
and
questioning
eyes
asked
why
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
he
is
a
boy
and
you
are
a
girl
;
he
is
sixteen
and
you
are
only
six
;
his
nature
is
strong
and
gay
,
and
yours
is
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
love
him
so
much
;
he
_
should
_
love
me
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
does
.
<EOS>
He
is
fond
of
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
his
favourite
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
Graham
's
favourite
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
more
than
any
little
child
I
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
assurance
soothed
her
;
she
smiled
in
her
anguish
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
I
continued
,
"
do
n't
fret
,
and
do
n't
expect
too
much
of
him
,
or
else
he
will
feel
you
to
be
troublesome
,
and
then
it
is
all
over
.
"
  
"
All
over
!
"
<EOS>
she
echoed
softly
;
"
then
I
'll
be
good
.
<EOS>
I
'll
try
to
be
good
,
Lucy
Snowe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
put
her
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
he
forgive
me
this
one
time
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
as
I
undressed
myself
.
<EOS>
I
assured
her
that
he
would
;
that
as
yet
he
was
by
no
means
alienated
;
that
she
had
only
to
be
careful
for
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
future
,
"
said
she
:
"
I
am
going
.
<EOS>
Shall
<EOS>
I
ever
 
ever
 
see
him
again
,
after
I
leave
England
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
returned
an
encouraging
response
.
<EOS>
The
candle
being
extinguished
,
a
still
half
-
hour
elapsed
.
<EOS>
I
thought
her
asleep
,
when
the
little
white
shape
once
more
lifted
itself
in
the
crib
,
and
the
small
voice
asked
 
"
Do
you
like
Graham
,
Miss
Snowe
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Like
him
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
a
little
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
a
little
!
<EOS>
Do
you
like
him
as
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
No
:
not
as
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
like
him
much
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
I
liked
him
a
little
.
<EOS>
Where
is
the
use
of
caring
for
him
so
very
much
:
he
is
full
of
faults
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
boys
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
More
than
girls
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
.
<EOS>
Wise
people
say
it
is
folly
to
think
anybody
perfect
;
and
as
to
likes
and
dislikes
,
we
should
be
friendly
to
all
,
and
worship
none
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
a
wise
person
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
try
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
Go
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
can
not
_
go
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
Have
you
no
pain
just
here
"
<EOS>
(
laying
her
elfish
hand
on
her
elfish
breast
,
)
"
when
you
think
_
you
_
shall
have
to
leave
Graham
;
for
_
your
_
home
is
not
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
Polly
,
"
said
I
,
<EOS>
"
you
should
not
feel
so
much
pain
when
you
are
very
soon
going
to
rejoin
your
father
.
<EOS>
Have
you
forgotten
him
?
<EOS>
Do
you
no
longer
wish
to
be
his
little
companion
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dead
silence
succeeded
this
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Child
,
lie
down
and
sleep
,
"
I
urged
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
bed
is
cold
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
warm
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
saw
the
little
thing
shiver
.
<EOS>
"
Come
to
me
,
"
I
said
,
wishing
,
yet
scarcely
hoping
,
that
she
would
comply
:
<EOS>
for
she
was
a
most
strange
,
capricious
,
little
creature
,
and
especially
whimsical
with
me
.
<EOS>
She
came
,
however
,
instantly
,
like
a
small
ghost
gliding
over
the
carpet
.
<EOS>
I
took
her
in
.
<EOS>
She
was
chill
:
I
warmed
her
in
my
arms
.
<EOS>
She
trembled
nervously
;
I
soothed
her
.
<EOS>
Thus
tranquillized
and
cherished
she
at
last
slumbered
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
unique
child
,
"
thought
I
,
as
I
viewed
her
sleeping
countenance
by
the
fitful
moonlight
,
and
cautiously
and
softly
wiped
her
glittering
eyelids
and
her
wet
cheeks
with
my
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
"
How
will
she
get
through
this
world
,
or
battle
with
this
life
?
<EOS>
How
will
she
bear
the
shocks
and
repulses
,
the
humiliations
and
desolations
,
which
books
,
and
my
own
reason
,
tell
me
are
prepared
for
all
flesh
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
departed
the
next
day
;
trembling
like
a
leaf
when
she
took
leave
,
but
exercising
self
-
command
.
    
<EOS>
MISS
MARCHMONT
.
  
<EOS>
On
quitting
Bretton
,
which
I
did
a
few
weeks
after
Paulina
's
departure
 
little
thinking
then
I
was
never
again
to
visit
it
;
never
more
to
tread
its
calm
old
streets
 
<EOS>
I
betook
myself
home
,
having
been
absent
six
months
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
conjectured
that
I
was
of
course
glad
to
return
to
the
bosom
of
my
kindred
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
the
amiable
conjecture
does
no
harm
,
and
may
therefore
be
safely
left
uncontradicted
.
<EOS>
Far
from
saying
nay
,
indeed
,
I
will
permit
the
reader
to
picture
me
,
for
the
next
eight
years
,
as
a
bark
slumbering
through
halcyon
weather
,
in
a
harbour
still
as
glass
 
<EOS>
the
steersman
stretched
on
the
little
deck
,
his
face
up
to
heaven
,
his
eyes
closed
:
<EOS>
buried
,
if
you
will
,
in
a
long
prayer
.
<EOS>
A
great
many
women
and
girls
are
supposed
to
pass
their
lives
something
in
that
fashion
;
why
not
I
with
the
rest
?
  
<EOS>
Picture
me
then
idle
,
basking
,
plump
,
and
happy
,
stretched
on
a
cushioned
deck
,
warmed
with
constant
sunshine
,
rocked
by
breezes
indolently
soft
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
can
not
be
concealed
that
,
in
that
case
,
I
must
somehow
have
fallen
overboard
,
or
that
there
must
have
been
wreck
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
too
well
remember
a
time
 
a
long
time
 
of
cold
,
of
danger
,
of
contention
.
<EOS>
To
this
hour
,
when
I
have
the
nightmare
,
it
repeats
the
rush
and
saltness
of
briny
waves
in
my
throat
,
and
their
icy
pressure
on
my
lungs
.
<EOS>
I
even
know
there
was
a
storm
,
and
that
not
of
one
hour
nor
one
day
.
<EOS>
For
many
days
and
nights
neither
sun
nor
stars
appeared
;
we
cast
with
our
own
hands
the
tackling
out
of
the
ship
;
a
heavy
tempest
lay
on
us
;
all
hope
that
we
should
be
saved
was
taken
away
.
<EOS>
In
fine
,
the
ship
was
lost
,
the
crew
perished
.
  
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
recollect
,
I
complained
to
no
one
about
these
troubles
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
to
whom
could
I
complain
?
<EOS>
Of
Mrs.
Bretton
I
had
long
lost
sight
.
<EOS>
Impediments
,
raised
by
others
,
had
,
years
ago
,
come
in
the
way
of
our
intercourse
,
and
cut
it
off
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
time
had
brought
changes
for
her
,
too
:
the
handsome
property
of
which
she
was
left
guardian
for
her
son
,
and
which
had
been
chiefly
invested
in
some
joint
-
stock
undertaking
,
had
melted
,
it
was
said
,
to
a
fraction
of
its
original
amount
.
<EOS>
Graham
,
I
learned
from
incidental
rumours
,
had
adopted
a
profession
;
both
he
and
his
mother
were
gone
from
Bretton
,
and
were
understood
to
be
now
in
London
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
there
remained
no
possibility
of
dependence
on
others
;
to
myself
alone
could
I
look
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
that
I
was
of
a
self
-
reliant
or
active
nature
;
but
self
-
reliance
and
exertion
were
forced
upon
me
by
circumstances
,
as
they
are
upon
thousands
besides
;
and
when
Miss
Marchmont
,
a
maiden
lady
of
our
neighbourhood
,
sent
for
me
,
I
obeyed
her
behest
,
in
the
hope
that
she
might
assign
me
some
task
I
could
undertake
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Marchmont
was
a
woman
of
fortune
,
and
lived
in
a
handsome
residence
;
but
she
was
a
rheumatic
cripple
,
impotent
,
foot
and
hand
,
and
had
been
so
for
twenty
years
.
<EOS>
She
always
sat
upstairs
:
her
drawing
-
room
adjoined
her
bed
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
had
often
heard
of
Miss
Marchmont
,
and
of
her
peculiarities
<EOS>
(
she
had
the
character
of
being
very
eccentric
)
,
but
till
now
had
never
seen
her
.
<EOS>
I
found
her
a
furrowed
,
grey
-
haired
woman
,
grave
with
solitude
,
stern
with
long
affliction
,
irritable
also
,
and
perhaps
exacting
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
that
a
maid
,
or
rather
companion
,
who
had
waited
on
her
for
some
years
,
was
about
to
be
married
;
and
she
,
hearing
of
my
bereaved
lot
,
had
sent
for
me
,
with
the
idea
that
I
might
supply
this
person
's
place
.
<EOS>
She
made
the
proposal
to
me
after
tea
,
as
she
and
I
sat
alone
by
her
fireside
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
be
an
easy
life
;
"
said
she
candidly
,
"
for
I
require
a
good
deal
of
attention
,
and
you
will
be
much
confined
;
yet
,
<EOS>
perhaps
,
contrasted
with
the
existence
you
have
lately
led
,
it
may
appear
tolerable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
reflected
.
<EOS>
Of
course
it
ought
to
appear
tolerable
,
I
argued
inwardly
;
but
somehow
,
by
some
strange
fatality
,
it
would
not
.
<EOS>
To
live
here
,
in
this
close
room
,
the
watcher
of
suffering
 
sometimes
,
perhaps
,
the
butt
of
temper
 
through
all
that
was
to
come
of
my
youth
;
while
all
that
was
gone
had
passed
,
to
say
the
least
,
not
blissfully
!
<EOS>
My
heart
sunk
one
moment
,
then
it
revived
;
for
though
I
forced
myself
to
_
realise
_
evils
,
I
think
I
was
too
prosaic
to
_
idealise
_
,
and
consequently
to
exaggerate
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
doubt
is
whether
I
should
have
strength
for
the
undertaking
,
"
I
observed
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
my
own
scruple
,
"
said
she
;
"
for
you
look
a
worn
-
out
creature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
I
did
.
<EOS>
I
saw
myself
in
the
glass
,
in
my
mourning
-
dress
,
a
faded
,
hollow
-
eyed
vision
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
thought
little
of
the
wan
spectacle
.
<EOS>
The
blight
,
I
believed
,
was
chiefly
external
:
I
still
felt
life
at
life
's
sources
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
else
have
you
in
view
 
anything
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
clear
as
yet
:
<EOS>
but
I
may
find
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
imagine
:
perhaps
you
are
right
.
<EOS>
Try
your
own
method
,
then
;
and
if
it
does
not
succeed
,
test
mine
.
<EOS>
The
chance
I
have
offered
shall
be
left
open
to
you
for
three
months
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
kind
.
<EOS>
I
told
her
so
,
and
expressed
my
gratitude
.
<EOS>
While
I
was
speaking
,
a
paroxysm
of
pain
came
on
.
<EOS>
I
ministered
to
her
;
made
the
necessary
applications
,
according
to
her
directions
,
and
,
by
the
time
she
was
relieved
,
a
sort
of
intimacy
was
already
formed
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
,
for
my
part
,
had
learned
from
the
manner
in
which
she
bore
this
attack
,
that
she
was
a
firm
,
patient
woman
(
patient
under
physical
pain
,
though
sometimes
perhaps
excitable
under
long
mental
canker
)
;
and
she
,
from
the
good
-
will
with
which
I
succoured
her
,
discovered
that
she
could
influence
my
sympathies
(
such
as
they
were
)
.
<EOS>
She
sent
for
me
the
next
day
;
for
five
or
six
successive
days
she
claimed
my
company
.
<EOS>
Closer
acquaintance
,
while
it
developed
both
faults
and
eccentricities
,
opened
,
at
the
same
time
,
a
view
of
a
character
I
could
respect
.
<EOS>
Stern
and
even
morose
as
she
sometimes
was
,
I
could
wait
on
her
and
sit
beside
her
with
that
calm
which
always
blesses
us
when
we
are
sensible
that
our
manners
,
presence
,
contact
,
please
and
soothe
the
persons
we
serve
.
<EOS>
Even
when
she
scolded
me
 
<EOS>
which
she
did
,
now
and
then
,
very
tartly
 
it
was
in
such
a
way
as
did
not
humiliate
,
and
left
no
sting
;
it
was
rather
like
an
irascible
mother
rating
her
daughter
,
than
a
harsh
mistress
lecturing
a
dependant
:
lecture
,
indeed
,
she
could
not
,
though
she
could
occasionally
storm
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
a
vein
of
reason
ever
ran
through
her
passion
:
she
was
logical
even
when
fierce
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
a
growing
sense
of
attachment
began
to
present
the
thought
of
staying
with
her
as
companion
in
quite
a
new
light
;
in
another
week
I
had
agreed
to
remain
.
  
<EOS>
Two
hot
,
close
rooms
thus
became
my
world
;
and
a
crippled
old
woman
,
my
mistress
,
my
friend
,
my
all
.
<EOS>
Her
service
was
my
duty
 
<EOS>
her
pain
,
my
suffering
 
her
relief
,
my
hope
 
her
anger
,
my
punishment
 
her
regard
,
my
reward
.
<EOS>
I
forgot
that
there
were
fields
,
woods
,
rivers
,
seas
,
an
ever
-
changing
sky
outside
the
steam
-
dimmed
lattice
of
this
sick
chamber
;
I
was
almost
content
to
forget
it
.
<EOS>
All
within
me
became
narrowed
to
my
lot
.
<EOS>
Tame
and
still
by
habit
,
disciplined
by
destiny
<EOS>
,
I
demanded
no
walks
in
the
fresh
air
;
my
appetite
needed
no
more
than
the
tiny
messes
served
for
the
invalid
.
<EOS>
In
addition
,
she
gave
me
the
originality
of
her
character
to
study
:
the
steadiness
of
her
virtues
,
I
will
add
,
the
power
of
her
passions
,
to
admire
;
the
truth
of
her
feelings
to
trust
.
<EOS>
All
these
things
she
had
,
and
for
these
things
I
clung
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
For
these
things
I
would
have
crawled
on
with
her
for
twenty
years
,
if
for
twenty
years
longer
her
life
of
endurance
had
been
protracted
.
<EOS>
But
another
decree
was
written
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
I
must
be
stimulated
into
action
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
goaded
,
driven
,
stung
,
forced
to
energy
.
<EOS>
My
little
morsel
of
human
affection
,
which
I
prized
as
if
it
were
a
solid
pearl
,
must
melt
in
my
fingers
and
slip
thence
like
a
dissolving
hailstone
.
<EOS>
My
small
adopted
duty
must
be
snatched
from
my
easily
contented
conscience
.
<EOS>
I
had
wanted
to
compromise
with
Fate
:
to
escape
occasional
great
agonies
by
submitting
to
a
whole
life
of
privation
and
small
pains
.
<EOS>
Fate
would
not
so
be
pacified
;
nor
would
Providence
sanction
this
shrinking
sloth
and
cowardly
indolence
.
  
<EOS>
One
February
night
 
<EOS>
I
remember
it
<EOS>
well
 
there
came
a
voice
near
Miss
Marchmont
's
house
,
heard
by
every
inmate
,
but
translated
,
perhaps
,
only
by
one
.
<EOS>
After
a
calm
winter
,
storms
were
ushering
in
the
spring
.
<EOS>
I
had
put
Miss
Marchmont
to
bed
;
I
sat
at
the
fireside
sewing
.
<EOS>
The
wind
was
wailing
at
the
windows
;
it
had
wailed
all
day
;
but
,
as
night
deepened
,
it
took
a
new
tone
 
<EOS>
an
accent
keen
,
piercing
,
<EOS>
almost
articulate
to
the
ear
;
a
plaint
,
piteous
and
disconsolate
to
the
nerves
,
trilled
in
every
gust
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
hush
!
<EOS>
hush
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
in
my
disturbed
mind
,
dropping
my
work
,
and
making
a
vain
effort
to
stop
my
ears
against
that
subtle
,
searching
cry
.
<EOS>
I
had
heard
that
very
voice
ere
this
,
and
compulsory
observation
had
forced
on
me
a
theory
as
to
what
it
boded
.
<EOS>
Three
times
in
the
course
of
my
life
,
events
had
taught
me
that
these
strange
accents
in
the
storm
 
this
restless
,
hopeless
cry
 
<EOS>
denote
a
coming
state
of
the
atmosphere
unpropitious
to
life
.
<EOS>
Epidemic
diseases
,
I
believed
,
were
often
heralded
by
a
gasping
,
sobbing
,
tormented
,
long
-
lamenting
east
wind
.
<EOS>
Hence
,
I
inferred
,
arose
the
legend
of
the
Banshee
.
<EOS>
I
fancied
,
too
,
I
had
noticed
 
but
was
not
philosopher
enough
to
know
whether
there
was
any
connection
between
the
circumstances
 
<EOS>
that
we
often
at
the
same
time
hear
of
disturbed
volcanic
action
in
distant
parts
of
the
world
;
of
rivers
suddenly
rushing
above
their
banks
;
and
of
strange
high
tides
flowing
furiously
in
on
low
sea
-
coasts
.
<EOS>
"
Our
globe
,
"
I
had
said
to
myself
,
"
seems
at
such
periods
torn
and
disordered
;
the
feeble
amongst
us
wither
in
her
distempered
breath
,
rushing
hot
from
steaming
volcanoes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
listened
and
trembled
;
Miss
Marchmont
slept
.
  
<EOS>
About
midnight
,
the
storm
in
one
half
-
hour
fell
to
a
dead
calm
.
<EOS>
The
fire
,
which
had
been
burning
dead
,
glowed
up
vividly
.
<EOS>
I
felt
the
air
change
,
and
become
keen
.
<EOS>
Raising
blind
and
curtain
,
I
looked
out
,
and
saw
in
the
stars
the
keen
sparkle
of
a
sharp
frost
.
  
<EOS>
Turning
away
,
the
object
that
met
my
eyes
was
Miss
Marchmont
awake
,
lifting
her
head
from
the
pillow
,
and
regarding
me
with
unusual
earnestness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
a
fine
night
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
I
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
so
,
"
she
said
;
"
for
I
feel
so
strong
,
so
well
.
<EOS>
Raise
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
young
to
-
night
,
"
she
continued
:
"
young
,
light
-
hearted
,
and
happy
.
<EOS>
What
if
my
complaint
be
about
to
take
a
turn
,
and
I
am
yet
destined
to
enjoy
health
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
miracle
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
these
are
not
the
days
of
miracles
,
"
I
thought
to
myself
,
and
wondered
to
hear
her
talk
so
.
<EOS>
She
went
on
directing
her
conversation
to
the
past
,
and
seeming
to
recall
its
incidents
,
scenes
,
and
personages
,
with
singular
vividness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
love
Memory
to
-
night
,
"
<EOS>
she
said
:
"
I
prize
her
as
my
best
friend
.
<EOS>
She
is
just
now
giving
me
a
deep
delight
:
she
is
bringing
back
to
my
heart
,
in
warm
and
beautiful
life
,
realities
 
not
mere
empty
ideas
,
but
what
were
once
realities
,
and
that
I
long
have
thought
decayed
,
dissolved
,
mixed
in
with
grave
-
mould
.
<EOS>
I
possess
just
now
the
hours
,
the
thoughts
,
the
hopes
of
my
youth
.
<EOS>
I
renew
the
love
of
my
life
 
its
only
love
 
almost
its
only
affection
;
for
I
am
not
a
particularly
good
woman
:
I
am
not
amiable
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
have
had
my
feelings
,
strong
and
concentrated
;
and
these
feelings
had
their
object
;
which
,
in
its
single
self
,
was
dear
to
me
,
as
to
the
majority
of
men
and
women
,
are
all
the
unnumbered
points
on
which
they
dissipate
their
regard
.
<EOS>
While
I
loved
,
and
while
I
was
loved
,
what
an
existence
I
enjoyed
!
<EOS>
What
a
glorious
year
I
can
recall
 
how
bright
it
comes
back
to
me
!
<EOS>
What
a
living
spring
 
<EOS>
what
a
warm
,
glad
summer
 
<EOS>
what
soft
moonlight
,
silvering
the
autumn
evenings
 
<EOS>
what
strength
of
hope
under
the
ice
-
bound
waters
and
frost
-
hoar
fields
of
that
year
's
winter
!
<EOS>
Through
that
year
my
heart
lived
with
Frank
's
heart
.
<EOS>
O
my
noble
Frank
 
<EOS>
my
faithful
Frank
 
<EOS>
my
_
<EOS>
good
_
Frank
!
<EOS>
so
much
better
than
myself
 
his
standard
in
all
things
so
much
higher
!
<EOS>
This
I
can
now
see
and
say
:
if
few
women
have
suffered
as
I
did
in
his
loss
,
few
have
enjoyed
what
I
did
in
his
love
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
far
better
kind
of
love
than
common
;
I
had
no
doubts
about
it
or
him
:
it
was
such
a
love
as
honoured
,
protected
,
and
elevated
,
no
less
than
it
gladdened
her
to
whom
it
was
given
.
<EOS>
Let
me
now
ask
,
just
at
this
moment
,
when
my
mind
is
so
strangely
clear
,
 
let
me
reflect
why
it
was
taken
from
me
?
<EOS>
For
what
crime
was
I
condemned
,
after
twelve
months
of
bliss
,
to
undergo
thirty
years
of
sorrow
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
she
continued
after
a
pause
:
"
I
can
not
 
_
can
not
_
see
the
reason
;
yet
at
this
hour
I
can
say
with
sincerity
,
what
I
never
tried
to
say
before
,
Inscrutable
God
,
Thy
will
be
done
!
<EOS>
And
at
this
moment
I
can
believe
that
death
will
restore
me
to
Frank
.
<EOS>
I
never
believed
it
till
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
dead
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
girl
,
"
she
said
,
"
one
happy
Christmas
Eve
I
dressed
and
decorated
myself
,
expecting
my
lover
,
very
soon
to
be
my
husband
,
would
come
that
night
to
visit
me
.
<EOS>
I
sat
down
to
wait
.
<EOS>
Once
more
I
see
that
moment
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
snow
twilight
stealing
through
the
window
over
which
the
curtain
was
not
dropped
,
for
I
designed
to
watch
him
ride
up
the
white
walk
;
I
see
and
feel
the
soft
firelight
warming
me
,
playing
on
my
silk
dress
,
and
fitfully
showing
me
my
own
young
figure
in
a
glass
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
moon
of
a
calm
winter
night
,
float
full
,
clear
,
and
cold
,
over
the
inky
mass
of
shrubbery
,
and
the
silvered
turf
of
my
grounds
.
<EOS>
I
wait
,
with
some
impatience
in
my
pulse
,
but
no
doubt
in
my
breast
.
<EOS>
The
flames
had
died
in
the
fire
,
but
it
was
a
bright
mass
yet
;
the
moon
was
mounting
high
,
but
she
was
still
visible
from
the
lattice
;
the
clock
neared
ten
;
he
rarely
tarried
later
than
this
,
but
once
or
twice
he
had
been
delayed
so
long
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
he
for
once
fail
me
?
<EOS>
No
 
not
even
for
once
;
and
now
he
was
coming
 
and
coming
fast
-
to
atone
for
lost
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Frank
!
<EOS>
you
furious
rider
,
"
I
said
inwardly
,
listening
gladly
,
yet
anxiously
,
to
his
approaching
gallop
,
"
you
shall
be
rebuked
for
this
:
I
will
tell
you
it
is
_
<EOS>
my
_
neck
you
are
putting
in
peril
;
for
whatever
is
yours
is
,
in
a
dearer
and
tenderer
sense
,
mine
.
<EOS>
"
There
he
was
:
I
saw
him
;
but
I
think
tears
were
in
my
eyes
,
my
sight
was
so
confused
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
horse
;
I
heard
it
stamp
 
<EOS>
I
saw
at
least
a
mass
;
I
heard
a
clamour
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Was
_
it
a
horse
?
<EOS>
or
what
heavy
,
dragging
thing
was
it
,
crossing
,
strangely
dark
,
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
How
could
I
name
that
thing
in
the
moonlight
before
me
?
<EOS>
or
how
could
I
utter
the
feeling
which
rose
in
my
soul
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
only
run
out
.
<EOS>
A
great
animal
 
<EOS>
truly
,
Frank
's
black
horse
 
stood
trembling
,
panting
,
snorting
before
the
door
;
a
man
held
it
Frank
,
as
I
thought
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
What
is
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
I
demanded
.
<EOS>
Thomas
,
my
own
servant
,
answered
by
saying
sharply
,
"
Go
into
the
house
,
madam
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
calling
to
another
servant
,
who
came
hurrying
from
the
kitchen
as
if
summoned
by
some
instinct
,
"
Ruth
,
take
missis
into
the
house
directly
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
was
kneeling
down
in
the
snow
,
beside
something
that
lay
there
 
something
that
I
had
seen
dragged
along
the
ground
 
something
that
sighed
,
that
groaned
on
my
breast
,
as
I
lifted
and
drew
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
dead
;
he
was
not
quite
unconscious
.
<EOS>
I
had
him
carried
in
;
I
refused
to
be
ordered
about
and
thrust
from
him
.
<EOS>
I
was
quite
collected
enough
,
not
only
to
be
my
own
mistress
but
the
mistress
of
others
.
<EOS>
They
had
begun
by
trying
to
treat
me
like
a
child
,
as
they
always
do
with
people
struck
by
God
's
hand
;
but
I
gave
place
to
none
except
the
surgeon
;
and
when
he
had
done
what
he
could
,
I
took
my
dying
Frank
to
myself
.
<EOS>
He
had
strength
to
fold
me
in
his
arms
;
he
had
power
to
speak
my
name
;
he
heard
me
as
I
prayed
over
him
very
softly
;
he
felt
me
as
I
tenderly
and
fondly
comforted
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Maria
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
am
dying
in
Paradise
.
"
<EOS>
He
spent
his
last
breath
in
faithful
words
for
me
.
<EOS>
When
the
dawn
of
Christmas
morning
broke
,
my
Frank
was
with
God
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
that
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
happened
thirty
years
ago
.
<EOS>
I
have
suffered
since
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
I
have
made
the
best
use
of
all
my
calamities
.
<EOS>
Soft
,
amiable
natures
they
would
have
refined
to
saintliness
;
of
strong
,
evil
spirits
they
would
have
made
demons
;
as
for
me
,
I
have
only
been
a
woe
-
struck
and
selfish
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
done
much
good
,
"
I
said
;
for
she
was
noted
for
her
liberal
almsgiving
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
withheld
money
,
you
mean
,
where
it
could
assuage
affliction
.
<EOS>
What
of
that
?
<EOS>
It
cost
me
no
effort
or
pang
to
give
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
from
this
day
I
am
about
to
enter
a
better
frame
of
mind
,
to
prepare
myself
for
reunion
with
Frank
.
<EOS>
You
see
I
still
think
of
Frank
more
than
of
God
;
and
unless
it
be
counted
that
in
thus
loving
the
creature
so
much
,
so
long
,
and
so
exclusively
,
I
have
not
at
least
blasphemed
the
Creator
,
small
is
my
chance
of
salvation
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
,
Lucy
,
of
these
things
?
<EOS>
Be
my
chaplain
,
and
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
question
I
could
not
answer
:
<EOS>
I
had
no
words
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
she
thought
I
_
had
_
answered
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
right
,
my
child
.
<EOS>
We
should
acknowledge
God
merciful
,
but
not
always
for
us
comprehensible
.
<EOS>
We
should
accept
our
own
lot
,
whatever
it
be
,
and
try
to
render
happy
that
of
others
.
<EOS>
Should
we
not
?
<EOS>
Well
,
to
-
morrow
I
will
begin
by
trying
to
make
you
happy
.
<EOS>
I
will
endeavour
to
do
something
for
you
,
Lucy
:
something
that
will
benefit
you
when
I
am
dead
.
<EOS>
My
head
aches
now
with
talking
too
much
;
still
I
am
happy
.
<EOS>
Go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
The
clock
strikes
two
.
<EOS>
How
late
you
sit
up
;
or
rather
how
late
I
,
in
my
selfishness
,
keep
you
up
.
<EOS>
But
go
now
;
have
no
more
anxiety
for
me
;
I
feel
I
shall
rest
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
composed
herself
as
if
to
slumber
.
<EOS>
I
,
too
,
retired
to
my
crib
in
a
closet
within
her
room
.
<EOS>
The
night
passed
in
quietness
;
quietly
her
doom
must
at
last
have
come
:
peacefully
and
painlessly
:
in
the
morning
she
was
found
without
life
,
nearly
cold
,
but
all
calm
and
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
Her
previous
excitement
of
spirits
and
change
of
mood
had
been
the
prelude
of
a
fit
;
one
stroke
sufficed
to
sever
the
thread
of
an
existence
so
long
fretted
by
affliction
.
    
<EOS>
TURNING
A
NEW
LEAF
.
  
<EOS>
My
mistress
being
dead
,
and
I
once
more
alone
,
I
had
to
look
out
for
a
new
place
.
<EOS>
About
this
time
I
might
be
a
little
 
a
very
little
 
shaken
in
nerves
.
<EOS>
I
grant
<EOS>
I
was
not
looking
well
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
thin
,
haggard
,
and
hollow
-
eyed
;
like
a
sitter
-
up
at
night
,
like
an
overwrought
servant
,
or
a
placeless
person
in
debt
.
<EOS>
In
debt
,
however
,
I
was
not
;
nor
quite
poor
;
for
though
Miss
Marchmont
had
not
had
time
to
benefit
me
,
as
,
on
that
last
night
,
she
said
she
intended
,
yet
,
after
the
funeral
,
my
wages
were
duly
paid
by
her
second
cousin
,
the
heir
,
an
avaricious
-
looking
man
,
with
pinched
nose
and
narrow
temples
,
<EOS>
who
,
indeed
,
I
heard
long
afterwards
,
turned
out
a
thorough
miser
:
a
direct
contrast
to
his
generous
kinswoman
,
and
a
foil
to
her
memory
,
blessed
to
this
day
by
the
poor
and
needy
.
<EOS>
The
possessor
,
then
,
of
fifteen
pounds
;
of
health
,
though
worn
,
not
broken
,
and
of
a
spirit
in
similar
condition
;
I
might
still
;
in
comparison
with
many
people
,
be
regarded
as
occupying
an
enviable
position
.
<EOS>
An
embarrassing
one
it
was
,
however
,
at
the
same
time
;
as
I
felt
with
some
acuteness
on
a
certain
day
,
of
which
the
corresponding
one
in
the
next
week
was
to
see
my
departure
from
my
present
abode
,
while
with
another
I
was
not
provided
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
dilemma
I
went
,
as
a
last
and
sole
resource
,
to
see
and
consult
an
old
servant
of
our
family
;
once
my
nurse
,
now
housekeeper
at
a
grand
mansion
not
far
from
Miss
Marchmont
's
.
<EOS>
I
spent
some
hours
with
her
;
she
comforted
,
but
knew
not
how
to
advise
me
.
<EOS>
Still
all
inward
darkness
,
I
left
her
about
twilight
;
a
walk
of
two
miles
lay
before
me
;
it
was
a
clear
,
frosty
night
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
my
solitude
,
my
poverty
,
and
my
perplexity
,
my
heart
,
nourished
and
nerved
with
the
vigour
of
a
youth
that
had
not
yet
counted
twenty
-
three
summers
,
beat
light
and
not
feebly
.
<EOS>
Not
feebly
,
I
am
sure
,
or
I
should
have
trembled
in
that
lonely
walk
,
which
lay
through
still
fields
,
and
passed
neither
village
nor
farmhouse
,
nor
cottage
:
<EOS>
I
should
have
quailed
in
the
absence
of
moonlight
,
for
it
was
by
the
leading
of
stars
<EOS>
only
I
traced
the
dim
path
;
I
should
have
quailed
still
more
in
the
unwonted
presence
of
that
which
to
-
night
shone
in
the
north
,
a
moving
mystery
 
the
Aurora
Borealis
.
<EOS>
But
this
solemn
stranger
influenced
me
otherwise
than
through
my
fears
.
<EOS>
Some
new
power
it
seemed
to
bring
.
<EOS>
I
drew
in
energy
with
the
keen
,
low
breeze
that
blew
on
its
path
.
<EOS>
A
bold
thought
was
sent
to
my
mind
;
my
mind
was
made
strong
to
receive
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
this
wilderness
,
"
it
was
said
to
me
,
"
and
go
out
hence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
was
the
query
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
not
very
far
to
look
;
gazing
from
this
country
parish
in
that
flat
,
rich
middle
of
England
 
I
mentally
saw
within
reach
what
I
had
never
yet
beheld
with
my
bodily
eyes
:
I
saw
London
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
I
returned
to
the
hall
,
and
asking
once
more
to
see
the
housekeeper
,
I
communicated
to
her
my
plan
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Barrett
was
a
grave
,
judicious
woman
,
though
she
knew
little
more
of
the
world
than
myself
;
but
grave
and
judicious
as
she
was
,
she
did
not
charge
me
with
being
out
of
my
senses
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
had
a
staid
manner
of
my
own
which
ere
now
had
been
as
good
to
me
as
cloak
and
hood
of
hodden
grey
,
since
under
its
favour
I
had
been
enabled
to
achieve
with
impunity
,
and
even
approbation
,
deeds
that
,
if
attempted
with
an
excited
and
unsettled
air
,
would
in
some
minds
have
stamped
me
as
a
dreamer
and
zealot
.
  
<EOS>
The
housekeeper
was
slowly
propounding
some
difficulties
,
while
she
prepared
orange
-
rind
for
marmalade
,
when
a
child
ran
past
the
window
and
came
bounding
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
pretty
child
,
and
as
it
danced
,
laughing
,
up
to
me
 
for
we
were
not
strangers
(
nor
,
indeed
,
was
<EOS>
its
mother
 
a
young
married
daughter
of
the
house
 
a
stranger
)
 
<EOS>
I
took
it
on
my
knee
.
  
<EOS>
Different
as
were
our
social
positions
now
,
this
child
's
mother
<EOS>
and
I
had
been
schoolfellows
,
when
I
was
a
girl
of
ten
and
she
a
young
lady
of
sixteen
;
and
I
remembered
her
,
good
-
looking
,
but
dull
,
in
a
lower
class
than
mine
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
admiring
the
boy
's
handsome
dark
eyes
,
when
the
mother
,
young
Mrs.
Leigh
,
entered
.
<EOS>
What
a
beautiful
and
kind
-
looking
woman
was
the
good
-
natured
and
comely
,
but
unintellectual
,
girl
become
!
<EOS>
Wifehood
and
maternity
had
changed
her
thus
,
as
I
have
since
seen
them
change
others
even
less
promising
than
she
.
<EOS>
Me
she
had
forgotten
.
<EOS>
I
was
changed
too
,
though
not
,
I
fear
,
for
the
better
.
<EOS>
I
made
no
attempt
to
recall
myself
to
her
memory
;
why
should
I
?
<EOS>
She
came
for
her
son
to
accompany
her
in
a
walk
,
and
behind
her
followed
a
nurse
,
carrying
an
infant
.
<EOS>
I
only
mention
the
incident
because
,
in
addressing
the
nurse
,
Mrs.
Leigh
spoke
French
(
very
bad
French
,
by
the
way
,
and
with
an
incorrigibly
bad
accent
,
again
forcibly
reminding
me
of
our
school
-
days
)
:
<EOS>
and
I
found
the
woman
was
a
foreigner
.
<EOS>
The
little
boy
chattered
volubly
in
French
too
.
<EOS>
When
the
whole
party
were
withdrawn
,
Mrs.
Barrett
remarked
that
her
young
lady
had
brought
that
foreign
nurse
home
with
her
two
years
ago
,
on
her
return
from
a
Continental
excursion
;
that
she
was
treated
almost
as
well
as
a
governess
,
and
had
nothing
to
do
but
walk
out
with
the
baby
and
chatter
French
with
Master
Charles
;
"
and
,
"
added
Mrs.
Barrett
,
"
she
says
there
are
many
Englishwomen
in
foreign
families
as
well
placed
as
she
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
stored
up
this
piece
of
casual
information
,
as
careful
housewives
store
seemingly
worthless
shreds
and
fragments
for
which
their
prescient
minds
anticipate
a
possible
use
some
day
.
<EOS>
Before
I
left
my
old
friend
,
she
gave
me
the
address
of
a
respectable
old
-
fashioned
inn
in
the
City
,
which
,
she
said
,
my
uncles
used
to
frequent
in
former
days
.
  
<EOS>
In
going
to
London
,
I
ran
less
risk
and
evinced
less
enterprise
than
the
reader
may
think
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
distance
was
only
fifty
miles
.
<EOS>
My
means
would
suffice
both
to
take
me
there
,
to
keep
me
a
few
days
,
and
also
to
bring
me
back
if
I
found
no
inducement
to
stay
.
<EOS>
I
regarded
it
as
a
brief
holiday
,
permitted
for
once
to
work
-
weary
faculties
,
rather
than
as
an
adventure
of
life
and
death
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
like
taking
all
you
do
at
a
moderate
estimate
:
it
keeps
mind
and
body
tranquil
;
whereas
grandiloquent
notions
are
apt
to
hurry
both
into
fever
.
  
<EOS>
Fifty
miles
were
then
a
day
's
journey
(
for
I
speak
of
a
time
gone
by
:
my
hair
,
which
,
till
a
late
period
,
withstood
the
frosts
of
time
,
lies
now
,
at
last
white
,
under
a
white
cap
,
like
snow
beneath
snow
)
.
<EOS>
About
nine
o'clock
of
a
wet
February
night
<EOS>
I
reached
London
.
  
<EOS>
My
reader
,
I
know
,
is
one
who
would
not
thank
me
for
an
elaborate
reproduction
of
poetic
first
impressions
;
and
it
is
well
,
inasmuch
as
I
had
neither
time
nor
mood
to
cherish
such
;
arriving
as
I
did
late
,
on
a
dark
,
raw
,
and
rainy
evening
,
in
a
Babylon
and
a
wilderness
,
of
which
the
vastness
and
the
strangeness
tried
to
the
utmost
any
powers
of
clear
thought
and
steady
self
-
possession
with
which
,
in
the
absence
of
more
brilliant
faculties
,
Nature
might
have
gifted
me
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
left
the
coach
,
the
strange
speech
of
the
cabmen
and
others
waiting
round
,
seemed
to
me
odd
as
a
foreign
tongue
.
<EOS>
I
had
never
before
heard
the
English
language
chopped
up
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
managed
to
understand
and
to
be
understood
,
so
far
as
to
get
myself
and
trunk
safely
conveyed
to
the
old
inn
<EOS>
whereof
I
had
the
address
.
<EOS>
How
difficult
,
how
oppressive
,
how
puzzling
seemed
my
flight
!
<EOS>
In
London
for
the
first
time
;
at
an
inn
for
the
first
time
;
tired
with
travelling
;
confused
with
darkness
;
palsied
with
cold
;
unfurnished
with
either
experience
or
advice
to
tell
me
how
to
act
,
and
yet
 
to
act
obliged
.
  
<EOS>
Into
the
hands
of
common
sense
I
confided
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Common
sense
,
however
,
was
as
chilled
and
bewildered
as
all
my
other
faculties
,
and
it
was
only
under
the
spur
of
an
inexorable
necessity
that
she
spasmodically
executed
her
trust
.
<EOS>
Thus
urged
,
she
paid
the
porter
:
considering
the
crisis
,
I
did
not
blame
her
too
much
that
she
was
hugely
cheated
;
she
asked
the
waiter
for
a
room
;
she
timorously
called
for
the
chambermaid
;
what
is
far
more
,
she
bore
,
without
being
wholly
overcome
,
a
highly
supercilious
style
of
demeanour
from
that
young
lady
,
when
she
appeared
.
  
<EOS>
I
recollect
this
same
chambermaid
<EOS>
was
a
pattern
of
town
prettiness
and
smartness
.
<EOS>
So
trim
her
waist
,
her
cap
,
her
dress
 
<EOS>
I
wondered
how
they
had
all
been
manufactured
.
<EOS>
Her
speech
had
an
accent
which
in
its
mincing
glibness
seemed
to
rebuke
mine
as
by
authority
;
her
spruce
attire
flaunted
an
easy
scorn
to
my
plain
country
garb
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
ca
n't
be
helped
,
"
I
thought
,
"
and
then
the
scene
is
new
,
and
the
circumstances
;
I
shall
gain
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maintaining
a
very
quiet
manner
towards
this
arrogant
little
maid
,
and
subsequently
observing
the
same
towards
the
parsonic
-
looking
,
black
-
coated
,
white
-
neckclothed
waiter
,
I
got
civility
from
them
<EOS>
ere
long
.
<EOS>
I
believe
at
first
they
thought
I
was
a
servant
;
but
in
a
little
while
they
changed
their
minds
,
and
hovered
in
a
doubtful
state
between
patronage
and
politeness
.
  
<EOS>
I
kept
up
well
till
I
had
partaken
of
some
refreshment
,
warmed
myself
by
a
fire
,
and
was
fairly
shut
into
my
own
room
;
but
,
as
I
sat
down
by
the
bed
and
rested
my
head
and
arms
on
the
pillow
,
a
terrible
oppression
overcame
me
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
my
position
rose
on
me
like
a
ghost
.
<EOS>
Anomalous
,
desolate
,
almost
blank
of
hope
it
stood
.
<EOS>
What
was
I
doing
here
alone
in
great
London
?
<EOS>
What
should
I
do
on
the
morrow
?
<EOS>
What
prospects
had
I
in
life
?
<EOS>
What
friends
had
I
on
,
earth
?
<EOS>
Whence
did
I
come
?
<EOS>
Whither
should
I
go
?
<EOS>
What
should
I
do
?
  
<EOS>
I
wet
the
pillow
,
my
arms
,
and
my
hair
,
with
rushing
tears
.
<EOS>
A
dark
interval
of
most
bitter
thought
followed
this
burst
;
but
I
did
not
regret
the
step
taken
,
nor
wish
to
retract
it
A
strong
,
vague
persuasion
that
it
was
better
to
go
forward
than
backward
,
and
that
I
_
<EOS>
could
_
go
forward
 
that
a
way
,
however
narrow
and
difficult
,
would
in
time
open
 
predominated
over
other
feelings
<EOS>
:
its
influence
hushed
them
so
far
,
that
at
last
I
became
sufficiently
tranquil
to
be
able
to
say
my
prayers
and
seek
my
couch
.
<EOS>
I
had
just
extinguished
my
candle
and
lain
down
,
when
a
deep
,
low
,
mighty
tone
swung
through
the
night
.
<EOS>
At
first
I
knew
it
not
;
but
it
was
uttered
twelve
times
,
and
at
the
twelfth
colossal
hum
and
trembling
knell
,
I
said
:
"
I
lie
in
the
shadow
of
St.
Paul
's
.
"
    
LONDON
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
was
the
first
of
March
,
and
when
I
awoke
,
rose
,
and
opened
my
curtain
,
I
saw
the
risen
sun
struggling
through
fog
.
<EOS>
Above
my
head
,
above
the
house
-
tops
,
co
-
elevate
almost
with
the
clouds
<EOS>
,
I
saw
a
solemn
,
orbed
mass
,
dark
blue
and
dim
 
THE
DOME
.
<EOS>
While
I
looked
,
my
inner
self
moved
;
my
spirit
shook
its
always
-
fettered
wings
half
loose
;
I
had
a
sudden
feeling
as
if
I
,
who
never
yet
truly
lived
,
were
at
last
about
to
taste
life
.
<EOS>
In
that
morning
my
soul
grew
as
fast
as
Jonah
's
gourd
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
well
to
come
,
"
I
said
,
proceeding
to
dress
with
speed
and
care
.
<EOS>
"
I
like
the
spirit
of
this
great
London
which
I
feel
around
me
.
<EOS>
Who
but
a
coward
would
pass
his
whole
life
in
hamlets
;
and
for
ever
abandon
his
faculties
to
the
eating
rust
of
obscurity
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Being
dressed
,
I
went
down
;
not
travel
-
worn
and
exhausted
,
but
tidy
and
refreshed
.
<EOS>
When
the
waiter
came
in
with
my
breakfast
,
I
managed
to
accost
him
sedately
,
yet
cheerfully
;
we
had
ten
minutes
'
discourse
,
in
the
course
of
which
we
became
usefully
known
to
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
a
grey
-
haired
,
elderly
man
;
and
,
it
seemed
,
had
lived
in
his
present
place
twenty
years
.
<EOS>
Having
ascertained
this
,
I
was
sure
he
must
remember
my
two
uncles
,
Charles
and
Wilmot
,
who
,
fifteen
,
years
ago
,
were
frequent
visitors
here
.
<EOS>
I
mentioned
their
names
;
he
recalled
them
perfectly
,
and
with
respect
.
<EOS>
Having
intimated
my
connection
,
my
position
in
his
eyes
was
henceforth
clear
,
and
on
a
right
footing
.
<EOS>
He
said
I
was
like
my
uncle
Charles
<EOS>
:
I
suppose
he
spoke
truth
,
because
Mrs.
Barrett
was
accustomed
to
say
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
A
ready
and
obliging
courtesy
now
replaced
his
former
uncomfortably
doubtful
manner
;
henceforth
I
need
no
longer
be
at
a
loss
for
a
civil
answer
to
a
sensible
question
.
  
<EOS>
The
street
on
which
my
little
sitting
-
room
window
looked
was
narrow
,
perfectly
quiet
,
and
not
dirty
<EOS>
:
the
few
passengers
were
just
such
as
one
sees
in
provincial
towns
:
here
was
nothing
formidable
;
I
felt
sure
I
might
venture
out
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Having
breakfasted
,
out
I
went
.
<EOS>
Elation
and
pleasure
were
in
my
heart
:
to
walk
alone
in
London
seemed
of
itself
an
adventure
.
<EOS>
Presently
I
found
myself
in
Paternoster
Row
 
classic
ground
this
.
<EOS>
I
entered
a
bookseller
's
shop
,
kept
by
one
Jones
<EOS>
:
I
bought
a
little
book
 
a
piece
of
extravagance
<EOS>
I
could
ill
afford
;
but
I
thought
I
would
one
day
give
or
send
it
to
Mrs.
Barrett
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Jones
,
a
dried
-
in
man
of
business
,
stood
behind
his
desk
:
he
seemed
one
of
the
greatest
,
and
I
one
of
the
happiest
of
beings
.
  
<EOS>
Prodigious
was
the
amount
of
life
I
lived
that
morning
.
<EOS>
Finding
myself
before
St.
Paul
's
,
I
went
in
;
I
mounted
to
the
dome
:
I
saw
thence
London
,
with
its
river
,
and
its
bridges
,
and
its
churches
;
I
saw
antique
Westminster
,
and
the
green
Temple
Gardens
,
with
sun
upon
them
,
and
a
glad
,
blue
sky
,
of
early
spring
above
;
and
between
them
and
it
,
not
too
dense
,
a
cloud
of
haze
.
  
<EOS>
Descending
,
I
went
wandering
whither
chance
might
lead
,
in
a
still
ecstasy
of
freedom
and
enjoyment
;
and
I
got
 
I
know
not
how
 
I
got
into
the
heart
of
city
life
.
<EOS>
I
saw
and
felt
London
at
last
:
I
got
into
the
Strand
;
I
went
up
Cornhill
;
I
mixed
with
the
life
passing
along
;
I
dared
the
perils
of
crossings
.
<EOS>
To
do
this
,
and
to
do
it
utterly
alone
,
gave
me
,
perhaps
an
irrational
,
but
a
real
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Since
those
days
,
I
have
seen
the
West
End
,
the
parks
,
the
fine
squares
;
but
I
love
the
city
far
better
.
<EOS>
The
city
seems
so
much
more
in
earnest
:
its
business
,
its
rush
,
its
roar
,
are
such
serious
things
,
sights
,
and
sounds
.
<EOS>
The
city
is
getting
its
living
 
<EOS>
the
West
End
<EOS>
but
enjoying
its
pleasure
.
<EOS>
At
the
West
End
you
may
be
amused
,
but
in
the
city
you
are
deeply
excited
.
  
<EOS>
Faint
,
at
last
,
and
hungry
(
it
was
years
since
I
had
felt
such
healthy
hunger
)
<EOS>
,
I
returned
,
about
two
o'clock
,
to
my
dark
,
old
,
and
quiet
inn
.
<EOS>
I
dined
on
two
dishes
 
a
plain
joint
and
vegetables
;
both
seemed
excellent
:
how
much
better
than
the
small
,
dainty
messes
Miss
Marchmont
's
cook
used
to
send
up
to
my
kind
,
dead
mistress
and
me
,
and
to
the
discussion
of
which
we
could
not
bring
half
an
appetite
between
us
!
<EOS>
Delightfully
tired
,
I
lay
down
,
on
three
chairs
for
an
hour
<EOS>
(
the
room
did
not
boast
a
sofa
)
.
<EOS>
I
slept
,
then
I
woke
and
thought
for
two
hours
.
  
<EOS>
My
state
of
mind
,
and
all
accompanying
circumstances
,
were
just
now
such
as
most
to
favour
the
adoption
of
a
new
,
resolute
,
and
daring
 
perhaps
desperate
 
line
of
action
.
<EOS>
I
had
nothing
to
lose
.
<EOS>
Unutterable
loathing
of
a
desolate
existence
past
,
forbade
return
.
<EOS>
If
I
failed
in
what
I
now
designed
to
undertake
,
who
,
save
myself
,
would
suffer
?
<EOS>
If
I
died
far
away
from
 
home
,
I
was
going
to
say
,
but
I
had
no
home
 
from
England
,
then
,
who
would
weep
?
  
<EOS>
I
might
suffer
;
I
was
inured
to
suffering
:
<EOS>
death
itself
had
not
,
I
thought
,
those
terrors
for
me
which
it
has
for
the
softly
reared
.
<EOS>
I
had
,
ere
this
<EOS>
,
looked
on
the
thought
of
death
with
a
quiet
eye
.
<EOS>
Prepared
,
then
,
for
any
consequences
,
I
formed
a
project
.
  
<EOS>
That
same
evening
I
obtained
from
my
friend
,
the
waiter
,
information
respecting
,
the
sailing
of
vessels
for
a
certain
continental
port
,
Boue
-
Marine
.
<EOS>
No
time
,
I
found
,
was
to
be
lost
:
that
very
night
I
must
take
my
berth
.
<EOS>
I
might
,
indeed
,
have
waited
till
the
morning
before
going
on
board
,
but
would
not
run
the
risk
of
being
too
late
.
  
<EOS>
"
Better
take
your
berth
at
once
,
ma'am
,
"
counselled
the
waiter
.
<EOS>
I
agreed
with
him
,
and
having
discharged
my
bill
,
and
acknowledged
my
friend
's
services
at
a
rate
which
I
now
know
was
princely
,
and
which
in
his
eyes
must
have
seemed
absurd
 
and
indeed
,
while
pocketing
the
cash
,
he
smiled
a
faint
smile
which
intimated
his
opinion
of
the
donor
's
_
savoir
-
faire
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
he
proceeded
to
call
a
coach
.
<EOS>
To
the
driver
he
also
recommended
me
,
giving
at
the
same
time
an
injunction
about
taking
me
,
I
think
,
to
the
wharf
,
and
not
leaving
me
to
the
watermen
;
which
that
functionary
promised
to
observe
,
but
failed
in
keeping
his
promise
:
on
the
contrary
,
he
offered
me
up
as
an
oblation
,
served
me
as
a
dripping
roast
,
making
me
alight
in
the
midst
of
a
throng
of
watermen
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
an
uncomfortable
crisis
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
dark
night
.
<EOS>
The
coachman
instantly
drove
off
as
soon
as
he
had
got
his
fare
:
the
watermen
commenced
a
struggle
for
me
and
my
trunk
.
<EOS>
Their
oaths
I
hear
at
this
moment
:
they
shook
my
philosophy
more
than
did
the
night
,
or
the
isolation
,
or
the
strangeness
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
One
laid
hands
on
my
trunk
.
<EOS>
I
looked
on
and
waited
quietly
;
but
<EOS>
when
another
laid
hands
on
me
,
I
spoke
up
,
shook
off
his
touch
,
stepped
at
once
into
a
boat
,
desired
austerely
that
the
trunk
should
be
placed
beside
me
 
"
Just
there
,
"
 
which
was
instantly
done
;
for
the
owner
of
the
boat
I
had
chosen
became
now
an
ally
:
I
was
rowed
off
.
  
<EOS>
Black
was
the
river
as
a
torrent
of
ink
;
lights
glanced
on
it
from
the
piles
of
building
round
,
ships
rocked
on
its
bosom
.
<EOS>
They
rowed
me
up
to
several
vessels
;
I
read
by
lantern
-
light
their
names
painted
in
great
white
letters
on
a
dark
ground
.
"
<EOS>
The
Ocean
,
"
"
The
Phoenix
,
"
"
The
Consort
,
"
"
The
Dolphin
,
"
were
passed
in
turns
;
but
"
The
Vivid
"
was
my
ship
,
and
it
seemed
she
lay
further
down
.
  
<EOS>
Down
the
sable
flood
we
glided
<EOS>
,
I
thought
of
the
Styx
,
and
of
Charon
rowing
some
solitary
soul
to
the
Land
of
Shades
.
<EOS>
Amidst
the
strange
scene
,
with
a
chilly
wind
blowing
in
my
face
and
midnight
clouds
dropping
rain
above
my
head
;
with
two
rude
rowers
for
companions
,
whose
insane
oaths
still
tortured
my
ear
,
I
asked
myself
if
I
was
wretched
or
terrified
.
<EOS>
I
was
neither
.
<EOS>
Often
in
my
life
have
I
been
far
more
so
under
comparatively
safe
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
How
is
this
?
"
said
I.
"
Methinks
<EOS>
I
am
animated
and
alert
,
instead
of
being
depressed
and
apprehensive
?
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
tell
how
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
THE
VIVID
"
started
out
,
white
and
glaring
,
from
the
black
night
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
you
are
!
"
said
the
waterman
,
and
instantly
demanded
six
shillings
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ask
too
much
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
He
drew
off
from
the
vessel
and
swore
he
would
not
embark
me
till
I
paid
it
.
<EOS>
A
young
man
,
the
steward
as
I
found
afterwards
,
was
looking
over
the
ship
's
side
;
he
grinned
a
smile
in
anticipation
of
the
coming
contest
;
to
disappoint
him
,
I
paid
the
money
.
<EOS>
Three
times
that
afternoon
I
had
given
crowns
where
I
should
have
given
shillings
;
but
I
consoled
myself
with
the
reflection
,
"
It
is
the
price
of
experience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
've
cheated
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
steward
exultingly
when
I
got
on
board
.
<EOS>
I
answered
phlegmatically
that
"
I
knew
it
,
"
and
went
below
.
  
<EOS>
A
stout
,
handsome
,
and
showy
woman
was
in
the
ladies
'
cabin
.
<EOS>
I
asked
to
be
shown
my
berth
;
she
looked
hard
at
me
,
muttered
something
about
its
being
unusual
for
passengers
to
come
on
board
at
that
hour
,
and
seemed
disposed
to
be
less
than
civil
.
<EOS>
What
a
face
she
had
 
so
comely
 
so
insolent
and
so
selfish
!
  
<EOS>
"
Now
that
I
am
on
board
,
I
shall
certainly
stay
here
,
"
was
my
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
trouble
you
to
show
me
my
berth
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
complied
,
but
sullenly
.
<EOS>
I
took
off
my
bonnet
,
arranged
my
things
,
and
lay
down
.
<EOS>
Some
difficulties
had
been
passed
through
;
a
sort
of
victory
was
won
:
<EOS>
my
homeless
,
anchorless
,
unsupported
mind
had
again
leisure
for
a
brief
repose
.
<EOS>
Till
the
"
Vivid
"
arrived
in
harbour
,
no
further
action
would
be
required
of
me
;
but
<EOS>
then
....
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
could
not
look
forward
.
<EOS>
Harassed
<EOS>
,
exhausted
,
I
lay
in
a
half
-
trance
.
  
<EOS>
The
stewardess
talked
all
night
;
not
to
me
but
to
the
young
steward
,
her
son
and
her
very
picture
.
<EOS>
He
passed
in
and
out
of
the
cabin
continually
<EOS>
:
they
disputed
,
they
quarrelled
,
they
made
it
up
again
twenty
times
in
the
course
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
She
professed
to
be
writing
a
letter
home
 
<EOS>
she
said
to
her
father
;
she
read
passages
of
it
aloud
,
heeding
me
no
more
than
a
stock
 
<EOS>
perhaps
she
believed
me
asleep
.
<EOS>
Several
of
these
passages
appeared
to
comprise
family
secrets
,
and
bore
special
reference
to
one
"
Charlotte
,
"
a
younger
sister
who
,
from
the
bearing
of
the
epistle
,
seemed
to
be
on
the
brink
of
perpetrating
a
romantic
and
imprudent
match
;
loud
was
the
protest
of
this
elder
lady
against
the
distasteful
union
.
<EOS>
The
dutiful
son
laughed
his
mother
's
correspondence
to
scorn
.
<EOS>
She
defended
it
,
and
raved
at
him
.
<EOS>
They
were
a
strange
pair
.
<EOS>
She
might
be
thirty
-
nine
or
forty
,
and
was
buxom
and
blooming
as
a
girl
of
twenty
.
<EOS>
Hard
,
loud
,
vain
and
vulgar
,
her
mind
and
body
alike
seemed
brazen
and
imperishable
.
<EOS>
I
should
think
,
from
her
childhood
,
she
must
have
lived
in
public
stations
;
and
in
her
youth
might
very
likely
have
been
a
barmaid
.
  
<EOS>
Towards
morning
her
discourse
ran
on
a
new
theme
:
"
the
Watsons
,
"
a
certain
expected
family
-
party
of
passengers
,
known
to
her
,
it
appeared
,
and
by
her
much
esteemed
on
account
of
the
handsome
profit
realized
in
their
fees
.
<EOS>
She
said
,
"
It
was
as
good
as
a
little
fortune
to
her
whenever
this
family
crossed
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
dawn
all
were
astir
,
and
by
sunrise
the
passengers
came
on
board
.
<EOS>
Boisterous
was
the
welcome
given
by
the
stewardess
to
the
"
Watsons
,
"
and
<EOS>
great
was
the
bustle
made
in
their
honour
.
<EOS>
They
were
four
in
number
,
two
males
and
two
females
.
<EOS>
Besides
them
,
there
was
but
one
other
passenger
 
a
young
lady
,
whom
a
gentlemanly
,
though
languid
-
looking
man
escorted
.
<EOS>
The
two
groups
offered
a
marked
contrast
.
<EOS>
The
Watsons
were
doubtless
rich
people
,
for
they
had
the
confidence
of
conscious
wealth
in
their
bearing
;
the
women
 
youthful
both
of
them
,
and
one
perfectly
handsome
,
as
far
as
physical
beauty
went
 
were
dressed
richly
,
gaily
,
and
absurdly
out
of
character
for
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Their
bonnets
with
bright
flowers
,
their
velvet
cloaks
and
silk
dresses
,
seemed
better
suited
for
park
or
promenade
than
for
a
damp
packet
deck
.
<EOS>
The
men
were
of
low
stature
,
plain
,
fat
,
and
vulgar
;
the
oldest
,
plainest
,
greasiest
,
broadest
,
I
soon
found
was
the
husband
 
<EOS>
the
bridegroom
I
suppose
,
<EOS>
for
she
was
very
young
 
of
the
beautiful
girl
.
<EOS>
Deep
was
my
amazement
at
this
discovery
;
and
deeper
still
when
I
perceived
that
,
instead
of
being
desperately
wretched
in
such
a
union
,
she
was
gay
even
to
giddiness
.
"
<EOS>
Her
laughter
,
"
I
reflected
,
"
must
be
the
mere
frenzy
of
despair
.
"
<EOS>
And
even
while
this
thought
was
crossing
my
mind
,
as
I
stood
leaning
quiet
and
solitary
against
the
ship
's
side
,
she
came
tripping
up
to
me
,
an
utter
stranger
,
with
a
camp
-
stool
in
her
hand
,
and
smiling
a
smile
of
which
the
levity
puzzled
and
startled
me
,
though
it
showed
a
perfect
set
of
perfect
teeth
,
she
offered
me
the
accommodation
of
this
piece
of
furniture
.
<EOS>
I
declined
it
of
course
,
with
all
the
courtesy
I
could
put
into
my
manner
;
she
danced
off
heedless
and
lightsome
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
been
good
-
natured
;
but
what
had
made
her
marry
that
individual
,
who
was
at
least
as
much
like
an
oil
-
barrel
as
a
man
?
  
<EOS>
The
other
lady
passenger
,
with
the
gentleman
-
companion
,
was
quite
a
girl
,
pretty
and
fair
:
<EOS>
her
simple
print
dress
,
untrimmed
straw
-
bonnet
and
large
shawl
,
gracefully
worn
,
formed
a
costume
plain
to
quakerism
:
yet
,
for
her
,
becoming
enough
.
<EOS>
Before
the
gentleman
quitted
her
,
I
observed
him
throwing
a
glance
of
scrutiny
over
all
the
passengers
,
as
if
to
ascertain
in
what
company
his
charge
would
be
left
.
<EOS>
With
a
most
dissatisfied
air
did
his
eye
turn
from
the
ladies
with
the
gay
flowers
;
he
looked
at
me
,
and
then
he
spoke
to
his
daughter
,
niece
,
or
whatever
she
was
:
she
also
glanced
in
my
direction
,
and
slightly
curled
her
short
,
pretty
lip
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
myself
,
or
it
might
be
my
homely
mourning
habit
,
that
elicited
this
mark
of
contempt
;
more
likely
,
both
.
<EOS>
A
bell
rang
;
her
father
<EOS>
(
I
afterwards
knew
that
it
was
her
father
)
kissed
her
,
and
returned
to
land
.
<EOS>
The
packet
sailed
.
  
<EOS>
Foreigners
say
that
it
is
only
English
girls
who
can
thus
be
trusted
to
travel
alone
,
and
deep
is
their
wonder
at
the
daring
confidence
of
English
parents
and
guardians
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
"
jeunes
Meess
,
"
by
some
their
intrepidity
is
pronounced
masculine
and
"
inconvenant
,
"
others
regard
them
as
the
passive
victims
of
an
educational
and
theological
system
which
wantonly
dispenses
with
proper
"
surveillance
.
<EOS>
"
Whether
this
particular
young
lady
was
of
the
sort
that
can
the
most
safely
be
left
unwatched
,
I
do
not
know
:
or
,
rather
did
not
_
<EOS>
then
_
know
;
but
it
soon
appeared
that
the
dignity
of
solitude
was
not
to
her
taste
.
<EOS>
She
paced
the
deck
once
or
twice
backwards
and
forwards
;
she
looked
with
a
little
sour
air
of
disdain
at
the
flaunting
silks
and
velvets
,
and
the
bears
which
thereon
danced
attendance
,
and
eventually
she
approached
me
and
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
fond
of
a
sea
-
voyage
?
"
was
her
question
.
  
<EOS>
I
explained
that
my
_
fondness
_
for
a
sea
-
voyage
had
yet
to
undergo
the
test
of
experience
;
I
had
never
made
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
charming
!
"
cried
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
quite
envy
you
<EOS>
the
novelty
:
first
impressions
,
you
know
,
are
so
pleasant
.
<EOS>
Now
I
have
made
so
many
,
I
quite
forget
the
first
:
I
am
quite
_
blasée
_
about
the
sea
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
laugh
at
me
?
<EOS>
"
she
inquired
,
with
a
frank
testiness
that
pleased
me
better
than
her
other
talk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
you
are
so
young
to
be
_
blasée
_
about
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
seventeen
"
(
a
little
piqued
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
hardly
look
sixteen
.
<EOS>
Do
you
like
travelling
alone
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
<EOS>
I
care
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
crossed
the
Channel
ten
times
,
alone
;
but
then
I
take
care
never
to
be
long
alone
<EOS>
:
I
always
make
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
scarcely
make
many
friends
this
voyage
,
I
think
"
(
glancing
at
the
Watson
-
group
,
who
were
now
laughing
and
making
a
great
deal
of
noise
on
deck
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
of
those
odious
men
and
women
,
"
said
she
:
"
such
people
should
be
steerage
passengers
.
<EOS>
Are
you
going
to
school
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
least
idea
 
<EOS>
beyond
,
at
least
,
the
port
of
Boue
-
Marine
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
stared
,
then
carelessly
ran
on
:
  
"
I
am
going
to
school
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
number
of
foreign
schools
I
have
been
at
in
my
life
!
<EOS>
And
yet
I
am
quite
an
ignoramus
.
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
 
nothing
in
the
world
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
;
except
that
I
play
and
dance
beautifully
,
 
and
French
and
German
of
course
I
know
,
to
speak
;
but
I
ca
n't
read
or
write
them
very
well
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
they
wanted
me
to
translate
a
page
of
an
easy
German
book
into
English
the
other
day
,
and
I
could
n't
do
it
.
<EOS>
Papa
was
so
mortified
:
he
says
it
looks
as
if
M.
de
Bassompierre
 
my
godpapa
,
who
pays
all
my
school
-
bills
 
had
thrown
away
all
his
money
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
in
matters
of
information
 
in
history
,
geography
,
arithmetic
,
and
so
on
,
I
am
quite
a
baby
;
and
I
write
English
so
badly
 
such
spelling
and
grammar
,
they
tell
me
.
<EOS>
Into
the
bargain
I
have
quite
forgotten
my
religion
;
they
call
me
a
Protestant
,
you
know
,
but
really
I
am
not
sure
whether
I
am
one
or
not
<EOS>
:
I
do
n't
well
know
the
difference
between
Romanism
and
Protestantism
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
do
n't
in
the
least
care
for
that
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
Lutheran
once
at
Bonn
 
dear
Bonn
!
 
<EOS>
charming
Bonn
!
 
<EOS>
where
there
were
so
many
handsome
students
.
<EOS>
Every
nice
girl
in
our
school
had
an
admirer
;
they
knew
our
hours
for
walking
out
,
and
almost
always
passed
us
on
the
promenade
:
"
<EOS>
Schönes
Mädchen
,
"
we
used
to
hear
them
say
.
<EOS>
I
was
excessively
happy
at
Bonn
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
are
you
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
at
 
_
chose
_
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
Miss
Ginevra
Fanshawe
(
such
was
this
young
person
's
name
)
only
substituted
this
word
"
_
chose
_
"
in
temporary
oblivion
of
the
real
name
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
habit
she
had
:
"
<EOS>
_
chose
_
<EOS>
"
came
in
at
every
turn
in
her
conversation
 
<EOS>
the
convenient
substitute
for
any
missing
word
in
any
language
she
might
chance
at
the
time
to
be
speaking
.
<EOS>
French
girls
often
do
the
like
;
from
them
she
had
caught
the
custom
.
"
<EOS>
_
Chose
_
,
"
however
,
I
found
in
this
instance
,
stood
for
Villette
 
the
great
capital
of
the
great
kingdom
of
Labassecour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
like
Villette
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
.
<EOS>
The
natives
,
you
know
,
are
intensely
stupid
and
vulgar
;
but
there
are
some
nice
English
families
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
in
a
school
?
"
  
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
good
one
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
horrid
:
<EOS>
but
I
go
out
every
Sunday
,
and
care
nothing
about
the
_
maîtresses
_
or
the
_
professeurs
_
,
or
the
_
élèves
<EOS>
_
,
and
send
lessons
<EOS>
_
au
diable
_
<EOS>
(
one
dare
n't
say
that
in
English
,
you
know
,
but
it
sounds
quite
right
in
French
)
;
and
thus
I
get
on
charmingly
....
<EOS>
You
are
laughing
at
me
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
I
am
only
smiling
at
my
own
thoughts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
they
?
"
<EOS>
(
Without
waiting
for
an
answer
)
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
_
do
_
tell
me
where
you
are
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
Fate
may
lead
me
.
<EOS>
My
business
is
to
earn
a
living
where
I
can
find
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
earn
!
"
<EOS>
(
in
consternation
)
"
are
you
poor
,
then
?
"
  
"
As
poor
as
Job
.
<EOS>
"
  
(
After
a
pause
)
 
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
<EOS>
how
unpleasant
!
<EOS>
But
_
I
<EOS>
_
know
what
it
is
to
be
poor
:
they
are
poor
enough
at
home
 
papa
and
mamma
,
and
all
of
them
.
<EOS>
Papa
is
called
Captain
Fanshawe
;
he
is
an
officer
on
half
-
pay
,
but
well
-
descended
,
and
some
of
our
connections
are
great
enough
;
but
my
uncle
and
godpapa
De
Bassompierre
,
who
lives
in
France
,
is
the
only
one
that
helps
us
:
he
educates
us
girls
.
<EOS>
I
have
five
sisters
and
three
brothers
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
we
are
to
marry
 
rather
elderly
gentlemen
,
I
suppose
,
with
cash
:
<EOS>
papa
and
mamma
manage
that
.
<EOS>
My
sister
Augusta
is
married
now
to
a
man
much
older
-
looking
than
papa
.
<EOS>
Augusta
is
very
beautiful
 
not
in
my
style
 
but
dark
;
her
husband
,
Mr.
Davies
,
had
the
yellow
fever
in
India
,
and
he
is
still
the
colour
of
a
guinea
;
but
then
he
is
rich
,
and
Augusta
has
her
carriage
and
establishment
,
and
we
all
think
she
has
done
perfectly
well
.
<EOS>
Now
,
this
is
better
than
'
earning
a
living
,
"
as
you
say
.
<EOS>
By
the
way
,
are
you
clever
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
 
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
play
,
sing
,
speak
three
or
four
languages
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
By
no
means
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Still
I
think
you
are
clever
"
(
a
pause
and
a
yawn
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
be
sea
-
sick
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
immensely
!
<EOS>
as
soon
as
ever
we
get
in
sight
of
the
sea
:
I
begin
,
indeed
,
to
feel
it
already
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
below
;
and
wo
n't
I
order
about
that
fat
odious
stewardess
!
<EOS>
Heureusement
je
<EOS>
sais
faire
aller
mon
monde
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Down
she
went
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
before
the
other
passengers
followed
her
:
throughout
the
afternoon
I
remained
on
deck
alone
.
<EOS>
When
I
recall
the
tranquil
,
and
even
happy
mood
in
which
I
passed
those
hours
,
and
remember
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
position
in
which
I
was
placed
;
its
hazardous
 
some
would
have
said
its
hopeless
 
character
;
I
feel
that
,
as
    
Stone
walls
do
not
a
prison
make
,
Nor
iron
bars
 
<EOS>
a
cage
,
  
so
peril
,
loneliness
,
an
uncertain
future
,
are
not
oppressive
evils
,
so
long
as
the
frame
is
healthy
and
the
faculties
are
employed
;
so
long
,
especially
,
as
Liberty
lends
us
her
wings
,
and
Hope
guides
us
by
her
star
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
not
sick
till
long
after
we
passed
Margate
,
and
deep
was
the
pleasure
I
drank
in
with
the
sea
-
breeze
;
divine
the
delight
I
drew
from
the
heaving
Channel
waves
,
from
the
sea
-
birds
on
their
ridges
,
from
the
white
sails
on
their
dark
distance
,
from
the
quiet
yet
beclouded
sky
,
overhanging
all
.
<EOS>
In
my
reverie
,
methought
I
saw
the
continent
of
Europe
,
like
a
wide
dream
-
land
,
far
away
.
<EOS>
Sunshine
lay
on
it
,
making
the
long
coast
one
line
of
gold
;
tiniest
tracery
of
clustered
town
and
snow
-
gleaming
tower
,
of
woods
deep
massed
,
of
heights
serrated
,
of
smooth
pasturage
and
veiny
stream
,
embossed
the
metal
-
bright
prospect
.
<EOS>
For
background
,
spread
a
sky
,
solemn
and
dark
blue
,
and
 
grand
with
imperial
promise
,
soft
with
tints
of
enchantment
 
strode
from
north
to
south
a
God
-
bent
bow
,
an
arch
of
hope
.
  
<EOS>
Cancel
the
whole
of
that
,
if
you
please
,
reader
 
or
rather
let
it
stand
,
and
draw
thence
a
moral
 
<EOS>
an
alliterative

text

copy
    
Day
-
dreams
are
delusions
of
the
demon
.
  
<EOS>
Becoming
excessively
sick
,
I
faltered
down
into
the
cabin
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Fanshawe
's
berth
chanced
to
be
next
mine
;
and
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
<EOS>
,
she
tormented
me
with
an
unsparing
selfishness
during
the
whole
time
of
our
mutual
distress
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
exceed
her
impatience
and
fretfulness
.
<EOS>
The
Watsons
,
who
were
very
sick
too
,
and
on
whom
the
stewardess
attended
with
shameless
partiality
,
were
stoics
compared
with
her
.
<EOS>
Many
a
time
since
have
I
noticed
,
in
persons
of
Ginevra
Fanshawe
's
light
,
careless
temperament
,
and
fair
,
fragile
style
of
beauty
,
an
entire
incapacity
to
endure
:
they
seem
to
sour
in
adversity
,
like
small
beer
in
thunder
.
<EOS>
The
man
who
takes
such
a
woman
for
his
wife
,
ought
to
be
prepared
to
guarantee
her
an
existence
all
sunshine
.
<EOS>
Indignant
at
last
with
her
teasing
peevishness
,
I
curtly
requested
her
"
to
hold
her
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
The
rebuff
did
her
good
,
and
it
was
observable
that
she
liked
me
no
worse
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
As
dark
night
drew
on
,
the
sea
roughened
:
<EOS>
larger
waves
swayed
strong
against
the
vessel
's
side
.
<EOS>
It
was
strange
to
reflect
that
blackness
and
water
were
round
us
,
and
to
feel
the
ship
ploughing
straight
on
her
pathless
way
,
despite
noise
,
billow
,
and
rising
gale
.
<EOS>
Articles
of
furniture
began
to
fall
about
,
and
it
became
needful
to
lash
them
to
their
places
;
the
passengers
grew
sicker
than
ever
;
Miss
Fanshawe
declared
,
with
groans
,
that
she
must
die
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
just
yet
,
honey
,
"
said
the
stewardess
.
<EOS>
"
We
're
just
in
port
.
"
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
,
a
calm
fell
upon
us
all
;
and
about
midnight
the
voyage
ended
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
sorry
:
<EOS>
yes
,
I
was
sorry
.
<EOS>
My
resting
-
time
was
past
;
my
difficulties
 
my
stringent
difficulties
 
recommenced
.
<EOS>
When
I
went
on
deck
,
the
cold
air
and
black
scowl
of
the
night
seemed
to
rebuke
me
for
my
presumption
in
being
where
I
was
:
the
lights
of
the
foreign
sea
-
port
town
,
glimmering
round
the
foreign
harbour
,
met
me
like
unnumbered
threatening
eyes
.
<EOS>
Friends
came
on
board
to
welcome
the
Watsons
;
a
whole
family
of
friends
surrounded
and
bore
away
Miss
Fanshawe
;
<EOS>
I
 
<EOS>
but
I
dared
not
for
one
moment
dwell
on
a
comparison
of
positions
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
where
should
I
go
?
<EOS>
I
must
go
somewhere
.
<EOS>
Necessity
dare
not
be
nice
.
<EOS>
As
I
gave
the
stewardess
her
fee
 
<EOS>
and
she
seemed
surprised
at
receiving
a
coin
of
more
value
than
,
<EOS>
from
such
a
quarter
,
her
coarse
calculations
had
probably
reckoned
on
 
I
said
,
"
Be
kind
enough
to
direct
me
to
some
quiet
,
respectable
inn
,
where
I
can
go
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
not
only
gave
me
the
required
direction
,
but
called
a
commissionaire
,
and
bid
him
take
charge
of
me
,
and
 
_
<EOS>
not
_
my
trunk
,
for
that
was
gone
to
the
custom
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
followed
this
man
along
a
rudely
-
paved
street
,
lit
now
by
a
fitful
gleam
of
moonlight
;
he
brought
me
to
the
inn
.
<EOS>
I
offered
him
sixpence
,
which
he
refused
to
take
;
supposing
it
not
enough
,
I
changed
it
for
a
shilling
;
but
this
also
he
declined
,
speaking
rather
sharply
,
in
a
language
to
me
unknown
.
<EOS>
A
waiter
,
coming
forward
into
the
lamp
-
lit
inn
-
passage
,
reminded
me
,
in
broken
English
,
that
my
money
was
foreign
money
,
not
current
here
.
<EOS>
I
gave
him
a
sovereign
to
change
.
<EOS>
This
little
matter
settled
,
I
asked
for
a
bedroom
;
supper
I
could
not
take
:
I
was
still
sea
-
sick
and
unnerved
,
and
trembling
all
over
.
<EOS>
How
deeply
glad
I
was
when
the
door
of
a
very
small
chamber
at
length
closed
on
me
and
my
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
Again
I
might
rest
:
though
the
cloud
of
doubt
would
be
as
thick
to
-
morrow
as
ever
;
the
necessity
for
exertion
more
urgent
,
the
peril
(
of
destitution
)
nearer
,
the
conflict
(
for
existence
)
more
severe
.
    
<EOS>
VILLETTE
.
  
<EOS>
I
awoke
next
morning
with
courage
revived
and
spirits
refreshed
:
physical
debility
no
longer
enervated
my
judgment
;
my
mind
felt
prompt
and
clear
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
I
finished
dressing
,
a
tap
came
to
the
door
:
I
said
,
"
Come
in
,
"
expecting
the
chambermaid
,
whereas
a
rough
man
walked
in
and
said
,
    
<EOS>
"
Gif
me
your
keys
,
Meess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gif
!
"
said
he
impatiently
;
and
as
he
half
-
snatched
them
from
my
hand
,
he
added
,
"
All
right
!
<EOS>
haf
your
tronc
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fortunately
it
did
turn
out
all
right
:
he
was
from
the
custom
-
house
.
<EOS>
Where
to
go
to
get
some
breakfast
I
could
not
tell
;
but
I
proceeded
,
not
without
hesitation
,
to
descend
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
observed
,
what
I
had
not
noticed
in
my
extreme
weariness
last
night
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
this
inn
was
,
in
fact
,
a
large
hotel
;
and
as
I
slowly
descended
the
broad
staircase
,
halting
on
each
step
<EOS>
(
for
I
was
in
wonderfully
little
haste
to
get
down
)
,
I
gazed
at
the
high
ceiling
above
me
,
at
the
painted
walls
around
,
at
the
wide
windows
which
filled
the
house
with
light
,
at
the
veined
marble
<EOS>
I
trod
(
for
the
steps
were
all
of
marble
,
though
uncarpeted
and
not
very
clean
)
,
and
contrasting
all
this
with
the
dimensions
of
the
closet
assigned
to
me
as
a
chamber
,
with
the
extreme
modesty
of
its
appointments
,
I
fell
into
a
philosophizing
mood
.
  
<EOS>
Much
I
marvelled
at
the
sagacity
evinced
by
waiters
and
chamber
-
maids
in
proportioning
the
accommodation
to
the
guest
.
<EOS>
How
could
inn
-
servants
and
ship
-
stewardesses
everywhere
tell
at
a
glance
that
I
,
for
instance
,
was
an
individual
of
no
social
significance
,
and
little
burdened
by
cash
?
<EOS>
They
_
<EOS>
did
_
know
it
evidently
<EOS>
:
I
saw
quite
well
that
they
all
,
in
a
moment
's
calculation
,
estimated
me
at
about
the
same
fractional
value
.
<EOS>
The
fact
seemed
to
me
curious
and
pregnant
:
I
would
not
disguise
from
myself
what
it
indicated
,
yet
managed
to
keep
up
my
spirits
pretty
well
under
its
pressure
.
  
<EOS>
Having
at
last
landed
in
a
great
hall
,
full
of
skylight
glare
,
I
made
my
way
somehow
to
what
proved
to
be
the
coffee
-
room
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
denied
that
on
entering
this
room
I
trembled
somewhat
<EOS>
;
felt
uncertain
,
solitary
,
wretched
;
wished
to
Heaven
<EOS>
I
knew
whether
I
was
doing
right
or
wrong
;
felt
convinced
that
it
was
the
last
,
but
could
not
help
myself
.
<EOS>
Acting
in
the
spirit
and
with
the
calm
of
a
fatalist
,
I
sat
down
at
a
small
table
,
to
which
a
waiter
presently
brought
me
some
breakfast
;
and
I
partook
of
that
meal
in
a
frame
of
mind
not
greatly
calculated
to
favour
digestion
.
<EOS>
There
were
many
other
people
breakfasting
at
other
tables
in
the
room
;
I
should
have
felt
rather
more
happy
if
amongst
them
all
I
could
have
seen
any
women
;
however
,
there
was
not
one
 
all
present
were
men
.
<EOS>
But
nobody
seemed
to
think
I
was
doing
anything
strange
;
one
or
two
gentlemen
glanced
at
me
occasionally
,
but
none
stared
obtrusively
:
I
suppose
if
there
was
anything
eccentric
in
the
business
,
they
accounted
for
it
by
this
word
"
Anglaise
!
"
  
<EOS>
Breakfast
over
,
I
must
again
move
 
in
what
direction
?
<EOS>
"
Go
to
Villette
,
"
said
an
inward
voice
;
prompted
doubtless
by
the
recollection
of
this
slight
sentence
uttered
carelessly
and
at
random
by
Miss
Fanshawe
,
as
she
bid
me
good
-
by
:
"
I
wish
you
would
come
to
Madame
Beck
's
;
she
has
some
marmots
whom
you
might
look
after
;
she
wants
an
English
gouvernante
,
or
was
wanting
one
two
months
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Who
Madame
Beck
was
,
where
she
lived
<EOS>
,
I
knew
not
;
I
had
asked
,
but
the
question
passed
unheard
:
Miss
Fanshawe
,
hurried
away
by
her
friends
,
left
it
unanswered
.
<EOS>
I
presumed
Villette
to
be
her
residence
 
to
Villette
I
would
go
.
<EOS>
The
distance
was
forty
miles
.
<EOS>
I
knew
I
was
catching
at
straws
;
but
in
the
wide
and
weltering
deep
where
I
found
myself
,
I
would
have
caught
at
cobwebs
.
<EOS>
Having
inquired
about
the
means
of
travelling
to
Villette
,
and
secured
a
seat
in
the
diligence
,
I
departed
on
the
strength
of
this
outline
 
this
shadow
of
a
project
.
<EOS>
Before
you
pronounce
on
the
rashness
of
the
proceeding
,
reader
,
look
back
to
the
point
whence
I
started
;
consider
the
desert
I
had
left
,
note
how
little
I
perilled
:
mine
was
the
game
where
the
player
can
not
lose
and
may
win
.
  
<EOS>
Of
an
artistic
temperament
,
I
deny
that
I
am
;
yet
I
must
possess
something
of
the
artist
's
faculty
of
making
the
most
of
present
pleasure
:
that
is
to
say
,
when
it
is
of
the
kind
to
my
taste
.
<EOS>
I
enjoyed
that
day
,
though
we
travelled
slowly
,
though
it
was
cold
,
though
it
rained
.
<EOS>
Somewhat
bare
,
flat
,
and
treeless
was
the
route
along
which
our
journey
lay
;
and
slimy
canals
crept
,
like
half
-
torpid
green
snakes
,
beside
the
road
;
and
formal
pollard
willows
edged
level
fields
,
tilled
like
kitchen
-
garden
beds
.
<EOS>
The
sky
,
too
,
was
monotonously
gray
;
the
atmosphere
was
stagnant
and
humid
;
yet
amidst
all
these
deadening
influences
,
my
fancy
budded
fresh
and
my
heart
basked
in
sunshine
.
<EOS>
These
feelings
,
however
,
were
well
kept
in
check
by
the
secret
but
ceaseless
consciousness
of
anxiety
lying
in
wait
on
enjoyment
,
like
a
tiger
crouched
in
a
jungle
.
<EOS>
The
breathing
of
that
beast
of
prey
was
in
my
ear
always
;
his
fierce
heart
panted
close
against
mine
;
he
never
stirred
in
his
lair
<EOS>
but
I
felt
him
<EOS>
:
I
knew
he
waited
only
for
sun
-
down
to
bound
ravenous
from
his
ambush
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
hoped
we
might
reach
Villette
ere
night
set
in
,
and
that
thus
I
might
escape
the
deeper
embarrassment
which
obscurity
seems
to
throw
round
a
first
arrival
at
an
unknown
bourne
;
but
,
what
with
our
slow
progress
and
long
stoppages
 
<EOS>
what
with
a
thick
fog
and
small
,
dense
rain
 
darkness
,
that
might
almost
be
felt
,
had
settled
on
the
city
by
the
time
we
gained
its
suburbs
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
we
passed
through
a
gate
where
soldiers
were
stationed
 
so
much
I
could
see
by
lamplight
;
then
,
having
left
behind
us
the
miry
Chaussée
,
we
rattled
over
a
pavement
of
strangely
rough
and
flinty
surface
.
<EOS>
At
a
bureau
,
the
diligence
stopped
,
and
the
passengers
alighted
.
<EOS>
My
first
business
was
to
get
my
trunk
;
a
small
matter
enough
,
but
important
to
me
.
<EOS>
Understanding
that
it
was
best
not
to
be
importunate
or
over
-
eager
about
luggage
,
but
to
wait
and
watch
quietly
the
delivery
of
other
boxes
till
I
saw
my
own
,
and
then
promptly
claim
and
secure
it
,
I
stood
apart
;
my
eye
fixed
on
that
part
of
the
vehicle
in
which
I
had
seen
my
little
portmanteau
safely
stowed
,
and
upon
which
piles
of
additional
bags
and
boxes
were
now
heaped
.
<EOS>
One
by
one
,
I
saw
these
removed
,
lowered
,
and
seized
on
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
sure
mine
ought
to
be
by
this
time
visible
:
it
was
not
.
<EOS>
I
had
tied
on
the
direction
-
card
with
a
piece
of
green
ribbon
,
that
I
might
know
it
at
a
glance
:
not
a
fringe
or
fragment
of
green
was
perceptible
.
<EOS>
Every
package
was
removed
;
every
tin
-
case
and
brown
-
paper
parcel
;
the
oilcloth
cover
was
lifted
;
I
saw
with
distinct
vision
that
not
an
umbrella
,
cloak
,
cane
,
hat
-
box
or
band
-
box
remained
.
  
<EOS>
And
my
portmanteau
,
with
my
few
clothes
and
little
pocket
-
book
enclasping
the
remnant
of
my
fifteen
pounds
,
where
were
they
?
  
<EOS>
I
ask
this
question
now
,
but
I
could
not
ask
it
then
.
<EOS>
I
could
say
nothing
whatever
;
not
possessing
a
phrase
of
_
speaking
_
French
:
<EOS>
and
it
was
French
,
and
French
only
<EOS>
,
the
whole
world
seemed
now
gabbling
around
me
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
What
_
should
I
do
?
<EOS>
Approaching
the
conductor
,
I
just
laid
my
hand
on
his
arm
,
pointed
to
a
trunk
,
thence
to
the
diligence
-
roof
,
and
tried
to
express
a
question
with
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
misunderstood
me
,
seized
the
trunk
indicated
,
and
was
about
to
hoist
it
on
the
vehicle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
that
alone
 
<EOS>
will
you
?
"
said
a
voice
in
good
English
;
then
,
in
correction
,
"
Qu'est
-
ce
que
vous
faîtes
donc
?
<EOS>
Cette
malle
est
à
moi
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
I
had
heard
the
Fatherland
accents
;
they
rejoiced
my
heart
;
I
turned
:
"
Sir
,
"
said
I
,
appealing
to
the
stranger
,
without
,
in
my
distress
,
noticing
what
he
was
like
,
"
I
can
not
speak
French
.
<EOS>
May
I
entreat
you
to
ask
this
man
what
he
has
done
with
my
trunk
?
"
  
<EOS>
Without
discriminating
,
for
the
moment
,
what
sort
of
face
it
was
to
which
my
eyes
were
raised
and
on
which
they
were
fixed
,
I
felt
in
its
expression
half
-
surprise
at
my
appeal
and
half
-
doubt
of
the
wisdom
of
interference
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
Do
_
ask
him
;
I
would
do
as
much
for
you
,
"
said
I.
  
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
he
smiled
,
but
he
said
in
a
gentlemanly
tone
 
that
is
to
say
,
a
tone
not
hard
nor
terrifying
,
 
<EOS>
"
What
sort
of
trunk
was
yours
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
described
it
,
including
in
my
description
the
green
ribbon
.
<EOS>
And
forthwith
he
took
the
conductor
under
hand
,
and
I
felt
,
through
all
the
storm
of
French
which
followed
,
that
he
raked
him
fore
and
aft
.
<EOS>
Presently
he
returned
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
fellow
avers
he
was
overloaded
,
and
confesses
that
he
removed
your
trunk
after
you
saw
it
put
on
,
and
has
left
it
behind
at
Boue
-
Marine
with
other
parcels
;
he
has
promised
,
however
,
to
forward
it
to
-
morrow
;
<EOS>
the
day
after
,
therefore
,
you
will
find
it
safe
at
this
bureau
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
I
:
<EOS>
but
my
heart
sank
.
  
<EOS>
Meantime
what
should
I
do
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
this
English
gentleman
saw
the
failure
of
courage
in
my
face
;
he
inquired
kindly
,
"
Have
you
any
friends
in
this
city
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
,
and
I
do
n't
know
where
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
pause
,
in
the
course
of
which
,
as
he
turned
more
fully
to
the
light
of
a
lamp
above
him
,
I
saw
that
he
was
a
young
,
distinguished
,
and
handsome
man
;
he
might
be
a
lord
,
for
anything
I
knew
:
nature
had
made
him
good
enough
for
a
prince
,
I
thought
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
very
pleasant
;
he
looked
high
but
not
arrogant
,
manly
but
not
overbearing
.
<EOS>
I
was
turning
away
,
in
the
deep
consciousness
of
all
absence
of
claim
to
look
for
further
help
from
such
a
one
as
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
all
your
money
in
your
trunk
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
stopping
me
.
  
<EOS>
How
thankful
was
I
to
be
able
to
answer
with
truth
 
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
have
enough
in
my
purse
"
<EOS>
(
for
I
had
near
twenty
francs
)
"
to
keep
me
at
a
quiet
inn
till
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
;
but
I
am
quite
a
stranger
in
Villette
,
and
do
n't
know
the
streets
and
the
inns
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
give
you
the
address
of
such
an
inn
as
you
want
,
"
said
he
;
"
and
it
is
not
far
off
:
with
my
direction
you
will
easily
find
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
tore
a
leaf
from
his
pocket
-
book
,
wrote
a
few
words
and
gave
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
_
<EOS>
did
_
think
him
kind
;
and
as
to
distrusting
him
,
or
his
advice
,
or
his
address
,
I
should
almost
as
soon
have
thought
of
distrusting
the
Bible
.
<EOS>
There
was
goodness
in
his
countenance
,
and
honour
in
his
bright
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
shortest
way
will
be
to
follow
the
Boulevard
and
cross
the
park
,
"
he
continued
;
"
but
it
is
too
late
and
too
dark
for
a
woman
to
go
through
the
park
alone
;
I
will
step
with
you
thus
far
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
moved
on
,
and
I
followed
him
,
through
the
darkness
and
the
small
soaking
rain
.
<EOS>
The
Boulevard
was
all
deserted
,
its
path
miry
,
the
water
dripping
from
its
trees
;
the
park
was
black
as
midnight
.
<EOS>
In
the
double
gloom
of
trees
and
fog
,
I
could
not
see
my
guide
;
I
could
only
follow
his
tread
.
<EOS>
Not
the
least
fear
had
I
<EOS>
:
I
believe
I
would
have
followed
that
frank
tread
,
through
continual
night
,
to
the
world
's
end
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
he
,
when
the
park
was
traversed
,
"
you
will
go
along
this
broad
street
till
you
come
to
steps
;
two
lamps
will
show
you
where
they
are
:
these
steps
you
will
descend
:
a
narrower
street
lies
below
;
following
that
,
at
the
bottom
you
will
find
your
inn
.
<EOS>
They
speak
English
there
,
so
your
difficulties
are
now
pretty
well
over
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
sir
,
"
said
I
:
"
accept
my
sincerest
thanks
.
<EOS>
"
And
we
parted
.
  
<EOS>
The
remembrance
of
his
countenance
,
which
I
am
sure
wore
a
light
not
unbenignant
to
the
friendless
 
the
sound
in
my
ear
of
his
voice
,
which
spoke
a
nature
chivalric
to
the
needy
and
feeble
,
as
well
as
the
youthful
and
fair
 
were
a
sort
of
cordial
to
me
long
after
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
true
young
English
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
On
I
went
,
hurrying
fast
through
a
magnificent
street
and
square
,
with
the
grandest
houses
round
,
and
amidst
them
the
huge
outline
of
more
than
one
overbearing
pile
;
which
might
be
palace
or
church
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
.
<EOS>
Just
as
I
passed
a
portico
,
two
mustachioed
men
came
suddenly
from
behind
the
pillars
;
they
were
smoking
cigars
:
their
dress
implied
pretensions
to
the
rank
of
gentlemen
,
but
,
poor
things
!
<EOS>
they
were
very
plebeian
in
soul
.
<EOS>
They
spoke
with
insolence
,
and
,
fast
as
I
walked
,
they
kept
pace
with
me
a
long
way
.
<EOS>
At
last
I
met
a
sort
of
patrol
,
and
my
dreaded
hunters
were
turned
from
the
pursuit
;
but
they
had
driven
me
beyond
my
reckoning
:
when
I
could
collect
my
faculties
,
I
no
longer
knew
where
I
was
;
the
staircase
I
must
long
since
have
passed
.
<EOS>
Puzzled
,
out
of
breath
,
all
my
pulses
throbbing
in
inevitable
agitation
,
I
knew
not
where
to
turn
.
<EOS>
It
was
terrible
to
think
of
again
encountering
those
bearded
,
sneering
simpletons
;
yet
the
ground
must
be
retraced
,
and
the
steps
sought
out
.
  
<EOS>
I
came
at
last
to
an
old
and
worn
flight
,
and
,
taking
it
for
granted
that
this
must
be
the
one
indicated
,
I
descended
them
.
<EOS>
The
street
into
which
they
led
was
indeed
narrow
,
but
it
contained
no
inn
.
<EOS>
On
I
wandered
.
<EOS>
In
a
very
quiet
and
comparatively
clean
and
well
-
paved
street
,
I
saw
a
light
burning
over
the
door
of
a
rather
large
house
,
loftier
by
a
story
than
those
round
it
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
This
_
might
be
the
inn
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
hastened
on
:
my
knees
now
trembled
under
me
:
<EOS>
I
was
getting
quite
exhausted
.
  
<EOS>
No
inn
was
this
.
<EOS>
A
brass
-
plate
embellished
the
great
porte
-
cochère
:
"
Pensionnat
de
Demoiselles
"
was
the
inscription
;
and
beneath
,
a
name
,
"
Madame
Beck
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
started
.
<EOS>
About
a
hundred
thoughts
volleyed
through
my
mind
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
planned
nothing
,
and
considered
nothing
:
I
had
not
time
.
<EOS>
Providence
said
,
"
Stop
here
;
this
is
_
your
_
inn
.
"
<EOS>
Fate
took
me
in
her
strong
hand
;
mastered
my
will
;
directed
my
actions
:
I
rang
the
door
-
bell
.
  
<EOS>
While
I
waited
,
I
would
not
reflect
.
<EOS>
I
fixedly
looked
at
the
street
-
stones
,
where
the
door
-
lamp
shone
,
and
counted
them
and
noted
their
shapes
,
and
the
glitter
of
wet
on
their
angles
.
<EOS>
I
rang
again
.
<EOS>
They
opened
at
last
.
<EOS>
A
bonne
in
a
smart
cap
stood
before
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
see
Madame
Beck
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
if
I
had
spoken
French
she
would
not
have
admitted
me
;
but
,
as
I
spoke
English
,
she
concluded
I
was
a
foreign
teacher
come
on
business
connected
with
the
pensionnat
,
and
,
even
at
that
late
hour
,
she
let
me
in
,
without
a
word
of
reluctance
,
or
a
moment
of
hesitation
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
moment
I
sat
in
a
cold
,
glittering
salon
,
with
porcelain
stove
,
unlit
,
and
gilded
ornaments
,
and
polished
floor
.
<EOS>
A
pendule
on
the
mantel
-
piece
struck
nine
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
A
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
.
<EOS>
How
fast
beat
every
pulse
in
my
frame
!
<EOS>
How
I
turned
cold
and
hot
by
turns
!
<EOS>
I
sat
with
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
 
a
great
white
folding
-
door
,
with
gilt
mouldings
:
I
watched
to
see
a
leaf
move
and
open
.
<EOS>
All
had
been
quiet
:
not
a
mouse
had
stirred
;
the
white
doors
were
closed
and
motionless
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ayre
Engliss
?
"
said
a
voice
at
my
elbow
.
<EOS>
I
almost
bounded
,
so
unexpected
was
the
sound
;
so
certain
had
I
been
of
solitude
.
  
<EOS>
No
ghost
stood
beside
me
,
nor
anything
of
spectral
aspect
;
merely
a
motherly
,
dumpy
little
woman
,
in
a
large
shawl
,
a
wrapping
-
gown
,
and
a
clean
,
trim
nightcap
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
I
was
English
,
and
immediately
,
without
further
prelude
,
we
fell
to
a
most
remarkable
conversation
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
(
for
Madame
Beck
it
was
 
<EOS>
she
had
entered
by
a
little
door
behind
me
,
and
,
being
shod
with
the
shoes
of
silence
<EOS>
,
I
had
heard
neither
her
entrance
nor
approach
)
 
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
had
exhausted
her
command
of
insular
speech
when
she
said
,
"
You
ayre
Engliss
,
"
and
she
now
proceeded
to
work
away
volubly
in
her
own
tongue
.
<EOS>
I
answered
in
mine
.
<EOS>
She
partly
understood
me
,
but
as
I
did
not
at
all
understand
her
 
though
we
made
together
an
awful
clamour
(
anything
like
Madame
's
gift
of
utterance
I
had
not
hitherto
heard
or
imagined
)
 
<EOS>
we
achieved
little
progress
.
<EOS>
She
rang
,
ere
long
,
for
aid
;
which
arrived
in
the
shape
of
a
"
maîtresse
,
"
who
had
been
partly
educated
in
an
Irish
convent
,
and
was
esteemed
a
perfect
adept
in
the
English
language
.
<EOS>
A
bluff
little
personage
<EOS>
this
maîtresse
was
 
Labassecourienne
from
top
to
toe
:
and
how
she
did
slaughter
the
speech
of
Albion
!
<EOS>
However
,
I
told
her
a
plain
tale
,
which
she
translated
.
<EOS>
I
told
her
how
I
had
left
my
own
country
,
intent
on
extending
my
knowledge
,
and
gaining
my
bread
;
how
I
was
ready
to
turn
my
hand
to
any
useful
thing
,
provided
it
was
not
wrong
or
degrading
;
how
I
would
be
a
child's
-
nurse
,
or
a
lady's
-
maid
,
and
would
not
refuse
even
housework
adapted
to
my
strength
.
<EOS>
Madame
heard
this
;
and
,
questioning
her
countenance
,
I
almost
thought
the
tale
won
her
ear
:
  
"
Il
n'y
a
que
<EOS>
les
Anglaises
pour
ces
sortes
d'entreprises
,
"
said
she
:
"
<EOS>
sont
-
elles
donc
intrépides
ces
femmes
là
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
asked
my
name
,
my
age
;
she
sat
and
looked
at
me
 
not
pityingly
,
not
with
interest
:
never
a
gleam
of
sympathy
,
or
a
shade
of
compassion
,
crossed
her
countenance
during
the
interview
.
<EOS>
I
felt
she
was
not
one
to
be
led
an
inch
by
her
feelings
:
grave
and
considerate
,
she
gazed
,
consulting
her
judgment
and
studying
my
narrative
.
<EOS>
A
bell
rang
.
  
<EOS>
"
Voilà
pour
<EOS>
la
prière
du
soir
!
<EOS>
"
said
she
,
and
rose
.
<EOS>
Through
her
interpreter
,
she
desired
me
to
depart
now
,
and
come
back
on
the
morrow
;
but
this
did
not
suit
me
:
I
could
not
bear
to
return
to
the
perils
of
darkness
and
the
street
.
<EOS>
With
energy
,
yet
with
a
collected
and
controlled
manner
,
I
said
,
addressing
herself
personally
,
and
not
the
maîtresse
:
"
Be
assured
,
madame
,
that
by
instantly
securing
my
services
,
your
interests
will
be
served
and
not
injured
<EOS>
:
you
will
find
me
one
who
will
wish
to
give
,
in
her
labour
,
a
full
equivalent
for
her
wages
;
and
if
you
hire
me
,
it
will
be
better
that
I
should
stay
here
this
night
:
having
no
acquaintance
in
Villette
,
and
not
possessing
the
language
of
the
country
,
how
can
I
secure
a
lodging
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
,
"
said
she
;
"
but
at
least
you
can
give
a
reference
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
inquired
after
my
luggage
:
I
told
her
when
it
would
arrive
.
<EOS>
She
mused
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
a
man
's
step
was
heard
in
the
vestibule
,
hastily
proceeding
to
the
outer
door
.
<EOS>
(
I
shall
go
on
with
this
part
of
my
tale
as
if
I
had
understood
all
that
passed
;
for
though
it
was
then
scarce
intelligible
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
heard
it
translated
afterwards
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
goes
out
now
?
"
demanded
Madame
Beck
,
listening
to
the
tread
.
  
<EOS>
"
M.
Paul
,
"
replied
the
teacher
.
"
<EOS>
He
came
this
evening
to
give
a
reading
to
the
first
class
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
very
man
I
should
at
this
moment
most
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
Call
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
teacher
ran
to
the
salon
door
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
was
summoned
.
<EOS>
He
entered
:
a
small
,
dark
and
spare
man
,
in
spectacles
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mon
cousin
,
"
began
Madame
,
"
I
want
your
opinion
.
<EOS>
We
know
your
skill
in
physiognomy
;
use
it
now
.
<EOS>
Read
that
countenance
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
little
man
fixed
on
me
his
spectacles
:
A
resolute
compression
of
the
lips
,
and
gathering
of
the
brow
,
seemed
to
say
that
he
meant
to
see
through
me
,
and
that
a
veil
would
be
no
veil
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
read
it
,
"
he
pronounced
.
  
<EOS>
"
Et
qu'en
dites
vous
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mais
 
bien
des
choses
,
"
was
the
oracular
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bad
or
good
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
each
kind
,
without
doubt
,
"
pursued
the
diviner
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
one
trust
her
word
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
negotiating
a
matter
of
importance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
wishes
me
to
engage
her
as
bonne
or
gouvernante
;
tells
a
tale
full
of
integrity
,
but
gives
no
reference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
stranger
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
An
Englishwoman
,
as
one
may
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
speaks
French
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
a
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
understands
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
may
then
speak
plainly
in
her
presence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Doubtless
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
gazed
steadily
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
need
her
services
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
do
with
them
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
am
disgusted
with
Madame
Svini
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Still
he
scrutinized
.
<EOS>
The
judgment
,
when
it
at
last
came
,
was
as
indefinite
as
what
had
gone
before
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Engage
her
.
<EOS>
If
good
predominates
in
that
nature
,
the
action
will
bring
its
own
reward
;
if
evil
 
eh
bien
!
<EOS>
ma
cousine
,
ce
sera
toujours
une
bonne
oeuvre
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
with
a
bow
and
a
"
bon
soir
,
"
this
vague
arbiter
of
my
destiny
vanished
.
  
<EOS>
And
Madame
did
engage
me
that
very
night
 
<EOS>
by
God
's
blessing
I
was
spared
the
necessity
of
passing
forth
again
into
the
lonesome
,
dreary
,
hostile
street
.
    
<EOS>
MADAME
BECK
.
  
<EOS>
Being
delivered
into
the
charge
of
the
maîtresse
,
I
was
led
through
a
long
narrow
passage
into
a
foreign
kitchen
,
very
clean
but
very
strange
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
contain
no
means
of
cooking
 
neither
fireplace
nor
oven
;
I
did
not
understand
that
the
great
black
furnace
which
filled
one
corner
,
was
an
efficient
substitute
for
these
.
<EOS>
Surely
pride
was
not
already
beginning
its
whispers
in
my
heart
;
yet
I
felt
a
sense
of
relief
when
,
instead
of
being
left
in
the
kitchen
,
as
I
half
anticipated
,
I
was
led
forward
to
a
small
inner
room
termed
a
"
cabinet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
cook
in
a
jacket
,
a
short
petticoat
and
sabots
,
brought
my
supper
:
to
wit
 
some
meat
,
nature
unknown
,
served
in
an
odd
and
acid
,
but
pleasant
sauce
;
some
chopped
potatoes
,
made
savoury
with
,
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
:
vinegar
and
sugar
,
I
think
:
<EOS>
a
tartine
,
or
slice
of
bread
and
butter
,
and
a
baked
pear
.
<EOS>
Being
hungry
,
I
ate
and
was
grateful
.
  
<EOS>
After
the
"
prière
du
soir
,
"
Madame
herself
came
to
have
another
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
She
desired
me
to
follow
her
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
Through
a
series
of
the
queerest
little
dormitories
 
which
,
I
heard
afterwards
,
had
once
been
nuns
'
cells
:
for
the
premises
were
in
part
of
ancient
date
 
and
through
the
oratory
 
a
long
,
low
,
gloomy
room
,
where
a
crucifix
hung
,
pale
,
against
the
wall
,
and
two
tapers
kept
dim
vigils
 
<EOS>
she
conducted
me
to
an
apartment
where
three
children
were
asleep
in
three
tiny
beds
.
<EOS>
A
heated
stove
made
the
air
of
this
room
oppressive
;
and
,
to
mend
matters
,
it
was
scented
with
an
odour
rather
strong
than
delicate
:
a
perfume
,
indeed
,
altogether
surprising
and
unexpected
under
the
circumstances
,
being
like
the
combination
of
smoke
with
some
spirituous
essence
 
<EOS>
a
smell
,
in
short
,
of
whisky
.
  
<EOS>
Beside
a
table
,
on
which
flared
the
remnant
of
a
candle
guttering
to
waste
in
the
socket
,
a
coarse
woman
,
heterogeneously
clad
in
a
broad
striped
showy
silk
dress
,
and
a
stuff
apron
,
sat
in
a
chair
fast
asleep
.
<EOS>
To
complete
the
picture
,
and
leave
no
doubt
as
to
the
state
of
matters
,
a
bottle
and
an
empty
glass
stood
at
the
sleeping
beauty
's
elbow
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
contemplated
this
remarkable
tableau
with
great
calm
;
she
neither
smiled
nor
scowled
;
no
impress
of
anger
,
disgust
,
or
surprise
,
ruffled
the
equality
of
her
grave
aspect
;
she
did
not
even
wake
the
woman
!
<EOS>
Serenely
pointing
to
a
fourth
bed
,
she
intimated
that
it
was
to
be
mine
;
then
,
having
extinguished
the
candle
and
substituted
for
it
a
night
-
lamp
,
she
glided
through
an
inner
door
,
which
she
left
ajar
 
the
entrance
to
her
own
chamber
,
a
large
,
well
-
furnished
apartment
;
as
was
discernible
through
the
aperture
.
  
<EOS>
My
devotions
that
night
were
all
thanksgiving
.
<EOS>
Strangely
had
I
been
led
since
morning
 
<EOS>
unexpectedly
had
I
been
provided
for
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
could
I
believe
that
not
forty
-
eight
hours
had
elapsed
since
I
left
London
,
under
no
other
guardianship
than
that
which
protects
the
passenger
-
bird
 
with
no
prospect
but
the
dubious
cloud
-
tracery
of
hope
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
a
light
sleeper
;
in
the
dead
of
night
I
suddenly
awoke
.
<EOS>
All
was
hushed
,
but
a
white
figure
stood
in
the
room
 
Madame
in
her
night
-
dress
.
<EOS>
Moving
without
perceptible
sound
,
she
visited
the
three
children
in
the
three
beds
;
she
approached
me
:
<EOS>
I
feigned
sleep
,
and
she
studied
me
long
.
<EOS>
A
small
pantomime
ensued
,
curious
enough
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
she
sat
a
quarter
of
an
hour
on
the
edge
of
my
bed
,
gazing
at
my
face
.
<EOS>
She
then
drew
nearer
,
bent
close
over
me
;
slightly
raised
my
cap
,
and
turned
back
the
border
so
as
to
expose
my
hair
;
she
looked
at
my
hand
lying
on
the
bedclothes
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
she
turned
to
the
chair
where
my
clothes
lay
:
<EOS>
it
was
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
Hearing
her
touch
and
lift
them
,
I
opened
my
eyes
with
precaution
,
for
I
own
<EOS>
I
felt
curious
to
see
how
far
her
taste
for
research
would
lead
her
.
<EOS>
It
led
her
a
good
way
:
every
article
did
she
inspect
.
<EOS>
I
divined
her
motive
for
this
proceeding
,
viz
.
<EOS>
the
wish
to
form
from
the
garments
a
judgment
respecting
the
wearer
,
her
station
,
means
,
neatness
,
&
<EOS>
c.
The
end
was
not
bad
,
but
the
means
were
hardly
fair
or
justifiable
.
<EOS>
In
my
dress
was
a
pocket
;
she
fairly
turned
it
inside
out
:
she
counted
the
money
in
my
purse
;
she
opened
a
little
memorandum
-
book
,
coolly
perused
its
contents
,
and
took
from
between
the
leaves
a
small
plaited
lock
of
Miss
Marchmont
's
grey
hair
.
<EOS>
To
a
bunch
of
three
keys
,
being
those
of
my
trunk
,
desk
,
and
work
-
box
,
she
accorded
special
attention
:
with
these
,
indeed
,
she
withdrew
a
moment
to
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
I
softly
rose
in
my
bed
and
followed
her
with
my
eye
:
these
keys
,
reader
,
were
not
brought
back
till
they
had
left
on
the
toilet
of
the
adjoining
room
the
impress
of
their
wards
in
wax
.
<EOS>
All
being
thus
done
decently
and
in
order
,
my
property
was
returned
to
its
place
,
my
clothes
were
carefully
refolded
.
<EOS>
Of
what
nature
were
the
conclusions
deduced
from
this
scrutiny
?
<EOS>
Were
they
favourable
or
otherwise
?
<EOS>
Vain
question
.
<EOS>
Madame
's
face
of
stone
(
for
of
stone
in
its
present
night
aspect
<EOS>
it
looked
:
<EOS>
it
had
been
human
,
and
,
as
I
said
before
,
motherly
,
in
the
salon
)
betrayed
no
response
.
  
<EOS>
Her
duty
done
 
<EOS>
I
felt
that
in
her
eyes
this
business
was
a
duty
 
<EOS>
she
rose
,
noiseless
as
a
shadow
<EOS>
:
she
moved
towards
her
own
chamber
;
at
the
door
,
she
turned
,
fixing
her
eye
on
the
heroine
of
the
bottle
,
who
still
slept
and
loudly
snored
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Svini
(
I
presume
this
was
Mrs.
Svini
,
Anglicé
or
Hibernicé
,
Sweeny
)
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sweeny
's
doom
was
in
Madame
Beck
's
eye
 
an
immutable
purpose
that
eye
spoke
:
<EOS>
Madame
's
visitations
for
shortcomings
might
be
slow
,
but
they
were
sure
.
<EOS>
All
this
was
very
un
-
English
:
truly
I
was
in
a
foreign
land
.
  
<EOS>
The
morrow
made
me
further
acquainted
with
Mrs.
Sweeny
.
<EOS>
It
seems
she
had
introduced
herself
to
her
present
employer
as
an
English
lady
in
reduced
circumstances
:
<EOS>
a
native
,
indeed
,
of
Middlesex
,
professing
to
speak
the
English
tongue
with
the
purest
metropolitan
accent
.
<EOS>
Madame
 
reliant
on
her
own
infallible
expedients
for
finding
out
the
truth
in
time
 
had
a
singular
intrepidity
in
hiring
service
off
-
hand
<EOS>
(
as
indeed
seemed
abundantly
proved
in
my
own
case
)
.
<EOS>
She
received
Mrs.
Sweeny
as
nursery
-
governess
to
her
three
children
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
explain
to
the
reader
that
this
lady
was
in
effect
a
native
of
Ireland
;
her
station
I
do
not
pretend
to
fix
:
she
boldly
declared
that
she
had
"
had
the
bringing
-
up
of
the
son
and
daughter
of
a
marquis
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
myself
,
she
might
possibly
have
been
a
hanger
-
on
,
nurse
,
fosterer
,
or
washerwoman
,
in
some
Irish
family
:
she
spoke
a
smothered
tongue
,
curiously
overlaid
with
mincing
cockney
inflections
.
<EOS>
By
some
means
or
other
she
had
acquired
,
and
now
held
in
possession
,
a
wardrobe
of
rather
suspicious
splendour
 
gowns
of
stiff
and
costly
silk
,
fitting
her
indifferently
,
and
apparently
made
for
other
proportions
than
those
they
now
adorned
;
caps
with
real
lace
borders
,
and
 
the
chief
item
in
the
inventory
,
the
spell
by
which
she
struck
a
certain
awe
through
the
household
,
quelling
the
otherwise
scornfully
disposed
teachers
and
servants
,
and
,
so
long
as
her
broad
shoulders
_
wore
_
the
folds
of
that
majestic
drapery
,
even
influencing
Madame
herself
 
_
a
real
Indian
shawl
_
 
"
un
véritable
cachemire
,
"
as
Madame
Beck
said
,
with
unmixed
reverence
and
amaze
.
<EOS>
I
feel
quite
sure
that
without
this
"
cachemire
"
she
would
not
have
kept
her
footing
in
the
pensionnat
for
two
days
:
by
virtue
of
it
,
and
it
<EOS>
only
,
she
maintained
the
same
a
month
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
Mrs.
Sweeny
knew
that
I
was
come
to
fill
her
shoes
,
then
it
was
that
she
declared
herself
 
then
did
she
rise
on
Madame
Beck
in
her
full
power
 
then
come
down
on
me
with
her
concentrated
weight
.
<EOS>
Madame
bore
this
revelation
and
visitation
<EOS>
so
well
,
<EOS>
so
stoically
,
that
I
for
very
shame
could
not
support
it
otherwise
than
with
composure
.
<EOS>
For
one
little
moment
Madame
Beck
absented
herself
from
the
room
;
ten
minutes
after
,
an
agent
of
the
police
stood
in
the
midst
of
us
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sweeny
and
her
effects
were
removed
.
<EOS>
Madame
's
brow
had
not
been
ruffled
during
the
scene
 
her
lips
had
not
dropped
one
sharply
-
accented
word
.
  
<EOS>
This
brisk
little
affair
of
the
dismissal
was
all
settled
before
breakfast
:
order
to
march
given
,
policeman
called
,
mutineer
expelled
;
"
chambre
d'enfans
"
fumigated
and
cleansed
,
windows
thrown
open
,
and
every
trace
of
the
accomplished
Mrs.
Sweeny
 
even
to
the
fine
essence
and
spiritual
fragrance
which
gave
token
so
subtle
and
so
fatal
of
the
head
and
front
of
her
offending
 
was
annihilated
from
the
Rue
Fossette
:
all
this
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
was
done
between
the
moment
of
Madame
Beck
's
issuing
like
Aurora
from
her
chamber
,
and
that
in
which
she
coolly
sat
down
to
pour
out
her
first
cup
of
coffee
.
  
<EOS>
About
noon
,
I
was
summoned
to
dress
Madame
.
<EOS>
(
It
appeared
my
place
was
to
be
a
hybrid
between
gouvernante
and
lady's
-
maid
.
)
<EOS>
Till
noon
,
she
haunted
the
house
in
her
wrapping
-
gown
,
shawl
,
and
soundless
slippers
.
<EOS>
How
would
the
lady
-
chief
of
an
English
school
approve
this
custom
?
  
<EOS>
The
dressing
of
her
hair
puzzled
me
;
she
had
plenty
of
it
:
auburn
,
unmixed
with
grey
:
though
she
was
forty
years
old
.
<EOS>
Seeing
my
embarrassment
,
she
said
,
"
You
have
not
been
a
femme
-
de
-
chambre
in
your
own
country
?
"
<EOS>
And
taking
the
brush
from
my
hand
,
and
setting
me
aside
,
not
ungently
or
disrespectfully
,
she
arranged
it
herself
.
<EOS>
In
performing
other
offices
of
the
toilet
,
she
half
-
directed
,
half
-
aided
me
,
without
the
least
display
of
temper
or
impatience
.
<EOS>
N.B.
 
<EOS>
That
was
the
first
and
last
time
I
was
required
to
dress
her
.
<EOS>
Henceforth
,
on
Rosine
,
the
portress
,
devolved
that
duty
.
  
<EOS>
When
attired
,
Madame
Beck
appeared
a
personage
of
a
figure
rather
short
and
stout
,
yet
still
graceful
in
its
own
peculiar
way
;
that
is
,
with
the
grace
resulting
from
proportion
of
parts
.
<EOS>
Her
complexion
was
fresh
and
sanguine
,
not
too
rubicund
;
her
eye
,
blue
and
serene
;
her
dark
silk
dress
fitted
her
as
a
French
sempstress
alone
can
make
a
dress
fit
;
she
looked
well
,
though
a
little
bourgeoise
;
as
bourgeoise
,
indeed
,
she
was
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
of
harmony
pervaded
her
whole
person
;
and
yet
her
face
offered
contrast
,
too
<EOS>
:
its
features
were
by
no
means
such
as
are
usually
seen
in
conjunction
with
a
complexion
of
such
blended
freshness
and
repose
:
<EOS>
their
outline
was
stern
:
her
forehead
was
high
but
narrow
;
it
expressed
capacity
and
some
benevolence
,
but
no
expanse
;
nor
did
her
peaceful
yet
watchful
eye
ever
know
the
fire
which
is
kindled
in
the
heart
or
the
softness
which
flows
thence
.
<EOS>
Her
mouth
was
hard
:
it
could
be
a
little
grim
;
her
lips
were
thin
.
<EOS>
For
sensibility
and
genius
,
with
all
their
tenderness
and
temerity
,
I
felt
somehow
that
Madame
would
be
the
right
sort
of
Minos
in
petticoats
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
long
run
,
I
found
she
was
something
else
in
petticoats
too
.
<EOS>
Her
name
was
Modeste
Maria
Beck
,
née
Kint
:
it
ought
to
have
been
Ignacia
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
charitable
woman
,
and
did
a
great
deal
of
good
.
<EOS>
There
never
was
a
mistress
whose
rule
was
milder
.
<EOS>
I
was
told
that
she
never
once
remonstrated
with
the
intolerable
Mrs.
Sweeny
,
despite
her
tipsiness
,
disorder
,
and
general
neglect
;
yet
Mrs.
Sweeny
had
to
go
the
moment
her
departure
became
convenient
.
<EOS>
I
was
told
,
too
,
that
neither
masters
nor
teachers
were
found
fault
with
in
that
establishment
;
yet
both
masters
and
teachers
were
often
changed
:
they
vanished
and
others
filled
their
places
,
none
could
well
explain
how
.
  
<EOS>
The
establishment
was
both
a
pensionnat
and
an
externat
:
<EOS>
the
externes
or
day
-
pupils
exceeded
one
hundred
in
number
;
the
boarders
were
about
a
score
.
<EOS>
Madame
must
have
possessed
high
administrative
powers
:
she
ruled
all
these
,
together
with
four
teachers
,
eight
masters
,
six
servants
,
and
three
children
,
managing
at
the
same
time
to
perfection
the
pupils
'
parents
and
friends
;
and
that
without
apparent
effort
;
without
bustle
,
fatigue
,
fever
,
or
any
symptom
of
undue
,
excitement
:
occupied
she
always
was
 
busy
,
rarely
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
Madame
had
her
own
system
for
managing
and
regulating
this
mass
of
machinery
;
and
a
very
pretty
system
it
was
:
<EOS>
the
reader
has
seen
a
specimen
of
it
,
in
that
small
affair
of
turning
my
pocket
inside
out
,
and
reading
my
private
memoranda
.
<EOS>
"
Surveillance
,
"
"
espionage
,
"
 
<EOS>
these
were
her
watchwords
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
Madame
knew
what
honesty
was
,
and
liked
it
 
that
is
,
when
it
did
not
obtrude
its
clumsy
scruples
in
the
way
of
her
will
and
interest
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
respect
for
"
Angleterre
;
"
and
as
to
"
les
Anglaises
,
"
she
would
have
the
women
of
no
other
country
about
her
own
children
,
if
she
could
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
Often
in
the
evening
,
after
she
had
been
plotting
and
counter
-
plotting
,
spying
and
receiving
the
reports
of
spies
all
day
,
she
would
come
up
to
my
room
 
a
trace
of
real
weariness
on
her
brow
 
<EOS>
and
she
would
sit
down
and
listen
while
the
children
said
their
little
prayers
to
me
in
English
:
<EOS>
the
Lord
's
Prayer
,
and
the
hymn
beginning
"
Gentle
Jesus
,
"
these
little
Catholics
were
permitted
to
repeat
at
my
knee
;
and
,
when
I
had
put
them
to
bed
,
she
would
talk
to
me
<EOS>
(
I
soon
gained
enough
French
to
be
able
to
understand
,
and
even
answer
her
)
about
England
and
Englishwomen
,
and
the
reasons
for
what
she
was
pleased
to
term
their
superior
intelligence
,
and
more
real
and
reliable
probity
.
<EOS>
Very
good
sense
she
often
showed
;
very
sound
opinions
she
often
broached
:
she
seemed
to
know
that
keeping
girls
in
distrustful
restraint
,
in
blind
ignorance
,
and
under
a
surveillance
that
left
them
no
moment
and
no
corner
for
retirement
,
was
not
the
best
way
to
make
them
grow
up
honest
and
modest
women
;
but
she
averred
that
ruinous
consequences
would
ensue
if
any
other
method
were
tried
with
continental
children
:
they
were
so
accustomed
to
restraint
,
that
relaxation
,
however
guarded
,
would
be
misunderstood
and
fatally
presumed
on
.
<EOS>
She
was
sick
,
she
would
declare
,
of
the
means
she
had
to
use
,
but
use
them
she
must
;
and
after
discoursing
,
often
with
dignity
and
delicacy
,
to
me
,
she
would
move
away
on
her
"
souliers
de
silence
,
"
and
glide
ghost
-
like
through
the
house
,
watching
and
spying
everywhere
,
peering
through
every
keyhole
,
listening
behind
every
door
.
  
<EOS>
After
all
,
Madame
's
system
was
not
bad
 
<EOS>
let
me
do
her
justice
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
better
than
all
her
arrangements
for
the
physical
well
-
being
of
her
scholars
.
<EOS>
No
minds
were
overtasked
:
the
lessons
were
well
distributed
and
made
incomparably
easy
to
the
learner
;
there
was
a
liberty
of
amusement
,
and
a
provision
for
exercise
which
kept
the
girls
healthy
;
the
food
was
abundant
and
good
:
<EOS>
neither
pale
nor
puny
faces
were
anywhere
to
be
seen
in
the
Rue
Fossette
.
<EOS>
She
never
grudged
a
holiday
;
she
allowed
plenty
of
time
for
sleeping
,
dressing
,
washing
,
eating
;
her
method
in
all
these
matters
was
easy
,
liberal
,
salutary
,
and
rational
:
many
an
austere
English
school
-
mistress
would
do
vastly
well
to
imitate
her
 
<EOS>
and
I
believe
many
would
be
glad
to
do
so
,
if
exacting
English
parents
would
let
them
.
  
<EOS>
As
Madame
Beck
ruled
by
espionage
,
she
of
course
had
her
staff
of
spies
:
she
perfectly
knew
the
quality
of
the
tools
she
used
,
and
while
she
would
not
scruple
to
handle
the
dirtiest
for
a
dirty
occasion
 
flinging
this
sort
from
her
like
refuse
rind
,
after
the
orange
has
been
duly
squeezed
 
<EOS>
I
have
known
her
fastidious
in
seeking
pure
metal
for
clean
uses
;
and
when
once
a
bloodless
and
rustless
instrument
was
found
,
she
was
careful
of
the
prize
,
keeping
it
in
silk
and
cotton
-
wool
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
woe
be
to
that
man
or
woman
who
relied
on
her
one
inch
beyond
the
point
where
it
was
her
interest
to
be
trustworthy
:
<EOS>
interest
was
the
master
-
key
of
Madame
's
nature
 
<EOS>
the
mainspring
of
her
motives
 
the
alpha
and
omega
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
her
_
feelings
_
appealed
to
,
and
I
have
smiled
in
half
-
pity
,
half
-
scorn
at
the
appellants
.
<EOS>
None
ever
gained
her
ear
through
that
channel
,
or
swayed
her
purpose
by
that
means
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
to
attempt
to
touch
her
heart
was
the
surest
way
to
rouse
her
antipathy
,
and
to
make
of
her
a
secret
foe
.
<EOS>
It
proved
to
her
that
she
had
no
heart
to
be
touched
:
it
reminded
her
where
she
was
impotent
and
dead
.
<EOS>
Never
was
the
distinction
between
charity
and
mercy
better
exemplified
than
in
her
.
<EOS>
While
devoid
of
sympathy
,
she
had
a
sufficiency
of
rational
benevolence
:
she
would
give
in
the
readiest
manner
to
people
she
had
never
seen
 
rather
,
however
,
to
classes
than
to
individuals
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pour
les
pauvres
,
"
she
opened
her
purse
freely
 
against
_
the
poor
man
_
,
as
a
rule
,
she
kept
it
closed
.
<EOS>
In
philanthropic
schemes
for
the
benefit
of
society
at
large
she
took
a
cheerful
part
;
no
private
sorrow
touched
her
:
no
force
or
mass
of
suffering
concentrated
in
one
heart
had
power
to
pierce
hers
.
<EOS>
Not
the
agony
in
Gethsemane
,
not
the
death
on
Calvary
,
could
have
wrung
from
her
eyes
one
tear
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
again
,
Madame
was
a
very
great
and
a
very
capable
woman
.
<EOS>
That
school
offered
her
for
her
powers
too
limited
a
sphere
;
she
ought
to
have
swayed
a
nation
:
she
should
have
been
the
leader
of
a
turbulent
legislative
assembly
.
<EOS>
Nobody
could
have
browbeaten
her
,
none
irritated
her
nerves
,
exhausted
her
patience
,
or
over
-
reached
her
astuteness
.
<EOS>
In
her
own
single
person
,
she
could
have
comprised
the
duties
of
a
first
minister
and
a
superintendent
of
police
.
<EOS>
Wise
,
firm
,
faithless
;
secret
,
crafty
,
passionless
;
watchful
and
inscrutable
;
acute
and
insensate
 
withal
perfectly
decorous
 
<EOS>
what
more
could
be
desired
?
  
<EOS>
The
sensible
reader
will
not
suppose
that
I
gained
all
the
knowledge
here
condensed
for
his
benefit
in
one
month
,
or
in
one
half
-
year
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
what
I
saw
at
first
was
the
thriving
outside
of
a
large
and
flourishing
educational
establishment
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
great
house
,
full
of
healthy
,
lively
girls
,
all
well
-
dressed
and
many
of
them
handsome
,
gaining
knowledge
by
a
marvellously
easy
method
,
without
painful
exertion
or
useless
waste
of
spirits
;
not
,
perhaps
,
making
very
rapid
progress
in
anything
;
taking
it
easy
,
but
still
always
employed
,
and
never
oppressed
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
corps
of
teachers
and
masters
,
more
stringently
tasked
,
as
all
the
real
head
-
labour
was
to
be
done
by
them
,
in
order
to
save
the
pupils
,
yet
having
their
duties
so
arranged
that
they
relieved
each
other
in
quick
succession
whenever
the
work
was
severe
:
here
,
in
short
,
was
a
foreign
school
;
of
which
the
life
,
movement
,
and
variety
made
it
a
complete
and
most
charming
contrast
to
many
English
institutions
of
the
same
kind
.
  
<EOS>
Behind
the
house
was
a
large
garden
,
and
,
in
summer
,
the
pupils
almost
lived
out
of
doors
amongst
the
rose
-
bushes
and
the
fruit
-
trees
.
<EOS>
Under
the
vast
and
vine
-
draped
berceau
,
Madame
would
take
her
seat
on
summer
afternoons
,
and
send
for
the
classes
,
in
turns
,
to
sit
round
her
and
sew
and
read
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
masters
came
and
went
,
delivering
short
and
lively
lectures
,
rather
than
lessons
,
and
the
pupils
made
notes
of
their
instructions
,
or
did
_
not
_
make
them
 
just
as
inclination
prompted
;
secure
that
,
in
case
of
neglect
,
they
could
copy
the
notes
of
their
companions
.
<EOS>
Besides
the
regular
monthly
_
jours
de
sortie
_
,
the
Catholic
fête
-
days
brought
a
succession
of
holidays
all
the
year
round
;
and
sometimes
on
a
bright
summer
morning
,
or
soft
summer
evening
;
the
boarders
were
taken
out
for
a
long
walk
into
the
country
,
regaled
with
_
gaufres
_
and
_
vin
blanc
_
,
or
new
milk
and
_
pain
<EOS>
bis
_
,
or
<EOS>
_
pistolets
au
beurre
_
(
rolls
)
and
coffee
.
<EOS>
All
this
seemed
very
pleasant
,
and
Madame
appeared
goodness
itself
;
and
the
teachers
not
so
bad
<EOS>
but
they
might
be
worse
;
and
the
pupils
,
perhaps
,
a
little
noisy
and
rough
,
but
types
of
health
and
glee
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
did
the
view
appear
,
seen
through
the
enchantment
of
distance
;
but
there
came
a
time
when
distance
was
to
melt
for
me
 
when
I
was
to
be
called
down
from
my
watch
-
tower
of
the
nursery
,
whence
<EOS>
I
had
hitherto
made
my
observations
,
and
was
to
be
compelled
into
closer
intercourse
with
this
little
world
of
the
Rue
Fossette
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
one
day
sitting
up
-
stairs
,
as
usual
,
hearing
the
children
their
English
lessons
,
and
at
the
same
time
turning
a
silk
dress
for
Madame
,
when
she
came
sauntering
into
the
room
with
that
absorbed
air
and
brow
of
hard
thought
she
sometimes
wore
,
and
which
made
her
look
so
little
genial
.
<EOS>
Dropping
into
a
seat
opposite
mine
,
she
remained
some
minutes
silent
.
<EOS>
Désirée
,
the
eldest
girl
,
was
reading
to
me
some
little
essay
of
Mrs.
Barbauld
's
,
and
I
was
making
her
translate
currently
from
English
to
French
as
she
proceeded
,
by
way
of
ascertaining
that
she
comprehended
what
she
read
<EOS>
:
Madame
listened
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
,
without
preface
or
prelude
,
she
said
,
almost
in
the
tone
of
one
making
an
accusation
,
"
Meess
,
in
England
you
were
a
governess
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Madame
,
"
said
I
smiling
,
<EOS>
"
you
are
mistaken
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
this
your
first
essay
at
teaching
 
this
attempt
with
my
children
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
assured
her
it
was
.
<EOS>
Again
she
became
silent
;
but
looking
up
,
as
I
took
a
pin
from
the
cushion
,
I
found
myself
an
object
of
study
:
she
held
me
under
her
eye
;
she
seemed
turning
me
round
in
her
thoughts
 
measuring
my
fitness
for
a
purpose
,
weighing
my
value
in
a
plan
.
<EOS>
Madame
had
,
ere
this
<EOS>
,
scrutinized
all
I
had
,
and
I
believe
she
esteemed
herself
cognizant
of
much
that
I
was
;
but
from
that
day
,
for
the
space
of
about
a
fortnight
,
she
tried
me
by
new
tests
.
<EOS>
She
listened
at
the
nursery
door
when
I
was
shut
in
with
the
children
;
she
followed
me
at
a
cautious
distance
when
I
walked
out
with
them
,
stealing
within
ear
-
shot
whenever
the
trees
of
park
or
boulevard
afforded
a
sufficient
screen
<EOS>
:
a
strict
preliminary
process
having
thus
been
observed
,
she
made
a
move
forward
.
  
<EOS>
One
morning
,
coming
on
me
abruptly
,
and
with
the
semblance
of
hurry
,
she
said
she
found
herself
placed
in
a
little
dilemma
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wilson
,
the
English
master
,
had
failed
to
come
at
his
hour
,
she
feared
he
was
ill
;
the
pupils
were
waiting
in
classe
;
there
was
no
one
to
give
a
lesson
;
should
I
,
for
once
,
object
to
giving
a
short
dictation
exercise
,
just
that
the
pupils
might
not
have
it
to
say
they
had
missed
their
English
lesson
?
  
<EOS>
"
In
classe
,
Madame
?
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
in
classe
:
in
the
second
division
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
there
are
sixty
pupils
,
"
said
I
;
for
I
knew
the
number
,
and
with
my
usual
base
habit
of
cowardice
,
I
shrank
into
my
sloth
like
a
snail
into
its
shell
,
and
alleged
incapacity
and
impracticability
as
a
pretext
to
escape
action
.
<EOS>
If
left
to
myself
,
I
should
infallibly
have
let
this
chance
slip
.
<EOS>
Inadventurous
,
unstirred
by
impulses
of
practical
ambition
<EOS>
,
I
was
capable
of
sitting
twenty
years
teaching
infants
the
hornbook
,
turning
silk
dresses
and
making
children
's
frocks
.
<EOS>
Not
that
true
contentment
dignified
this
infatuated
resignation
:
my
work
had
neither
charm
for
my
taste
,
nor
hold
on
my
interest
;
but
it
seemed
to
me
a
great
thing
to
be
without
heavy
anxiety
,
and
relieved
from
intimate
trial
<EOS>
:
the
negation
of
severe
suffering
was
the
nearest
approach
to
happiness
I
expected
to
know
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
seemed
to
hold
two
lives
 
<EOS>
the
life
of
thought
,
and
that
of
reality
;
and
,
provided
the
former
was
nourished
with
a
sufficiency
of
the
strange
necromantic
joys
of
fancy
,
the
privileges
of
the
latter
might
remain
limited
to
daily
bread
,
hourly
work
,
and
a
roof
of
shelter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
said
Madame
,
as
I
stooped
more
busily
than
ever
over
the
cutting
-
out
of
a
child
's
pinafore
,
"
leave
that
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Fifine
wants
it
,
Madame
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fifine
must
want
it
,
then
,
for
I
want
_
you
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
as
Madame
Beck
did
really
want
and
was
resolved
to
have
me
 
as
she
had
long
been
dissatisfied
with
the
English
master
,
with
his
shortcomings
in
punctuality
,
and
his
careless
method
of
tuition
 
as
,
too
<EOS>
,
_
she
_
did
not
lack
resolution
and
practical
activity
,
whether
_
<EOS>
I
_
lacked
them
or
not
 
<EOS>
she
,
without
more
ado
,
made
me
relinquish
thimble
and
needle
;
my
hand
was
taken
into
hers
,
and
I
was
conducted
down
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
When
we
reached
the
carré
,
a
large
square
hall
between
the
dwelling
-
house
and
the
pensionnat
,
she
paused
,
dropped
my
hand
,
faced
,
and
scrutinized
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
flushed
,
and
tremulous
from
head
to
foot
:
tell
it
not
in
Gath
,
I
believe
I
was
crying
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
difficulties
before
me
were
far
from
being
wholly
imaginary
;
some
of
them
were
real
enough
;
and
not
the
least
substantial
lay
in
my
want
of
mastery
over
the
medium
through
which
I
should
be
obliged
to
teach
.
<EOS>
I
had
,
indeed
,
studied
French
closely
since
my
arrival
in
Villette
;
learning
its
practice
by
day
,
and
its
theory
in
every
leisure
moment
at
night
,
to
as
late
an
hour
as
the
rule
of
the
house
would
allow
candle
-
light
;
but
I
was
far
from
yet
being
able
to
trust
my
powers
of
correct
oral
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dîtes
donc
,
"
said
Madame
sternly
,
"
vous
sentez
vous
réellement
trop
faible
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
might
have
said
"
Yes
,
"
and
gone
back
to
nursery
obscurity
,
and
there
,
perhaps
,
mouldered
for
the
rest
of
my
life
;
but
looking
up
at
Madame
,
I
saw
in
her
countenance
a
something
that
made
me
think
twice
ere
<EOS>
I
decided
.
<EOS>
At
that
instant
she
did
not
wear
a
woman
's
aspect
,
but
rather
a
man
's
.
<EOS>
Power
of
a
particular
kind
strongly
limned
itself
in
all
her
traits
,
and
that
power
was
not
my
kind
of
power
:
<EOS>
neither
sympathy
,
nor
congeniality
,
nor
submission
,
were
the
emotions
it
awakened
.
<EOS>
I
stood
 
not
soothed
,
nor
won
,
nor
overwhelmed
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
a
challenge
of
strength
between
opposing
gifts
was
given
,
and
I
suddenly
felt
all
the
dishonour
of
my
diffidence
 
all
the
pusillanimity
of
my
slackness
to
aspire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
,
"
she
said
,
"
go
backward
or
forward
?
<EOS>
"
indicating
with
her
hand
,
first
,
the
small
door
of
communication
with
the
dwelling
-
house
,
and
then
the
great
double
portals
of
the
classes
or
schoolrooms
.
  
<EOS>
"
En
avant
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
pursued
she
,
cooling
as
I
warmed
,
and
continuing
the
hard
look
,
from
very
antipathy
to
which
I
drew
strength
and
determination
,
"
can
you
face
the
classes
,
or
are
you
over
-
excited
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
sneered
slightly
in
saying
this
:
nervous
excitability
was
not
much
to
Madame
's
taste
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
no
more
excited
than
this
stone
,
"
I
said
,
tapping
the
flag
with
my
toe
:
"
or
than
you
,
"
I
added
,
returning
her
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bon
!
<EOS>
But
let
me
tell
you
these
are
not
quiet
,
decorous
,
English
girls
you
are
going
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
Ce
sont
des
Labassecouriennes
,
rondes
,
franches
,
brusques
,
et
tant
soit
peu
rebelles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
said
:
"
I
know
;
<EOS>
and
I
know
,
too
,
<EOS>
that
though
I
have
studied
French
hard
since
I
came
here
,
yet
I
still
speak
it
with
far
too
much
hesitation
 
<EOS>
too
little
accuracy
to
be
able
to
command
their
respect
<EOS>
I
shall
make
blunders
that
will
lay
me
open
to
the
scorn
of
the
most
ignorant
.
<EOS>
Still
I
mean
to
give
the
lesson
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
They
always
throw
over
timid
teachers
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
too
,
Madame
;
I
have
heard
how
they
rebelled
against
and
persecuted
Miss
Turner
"
 
a
poor
friendless
English
teacher
,
whom
Madame
had
employed
,
and
lightly
discarded
;
and
to
whose
piteous
history
I
was
no
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
"
C'est
vrai
,
"
said
she
,
coolly
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Turner
had
no
more
command
over
them
than
a
servant
from
the
kitchen
would
have
had
.
<EOS>
She
was
weak
and
wavering
;
she
had
neither
tact
nor
intelligence
,
decision
nor
dignity
.
<EOS>
Miss
Turner
would
not
do
for
these
girls
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
made
no
reply
,
but
advanced
to
the
closed
schoolroom
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
expect
aid
from
me
,
or
from
any
one
,
"
said
Madame
.
<EOS>
"
That
would
at
once
set
you
down
as
incompetent
for
your
office
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
opened
the
door
,
let
her
pass
with
courtesy
,
and
followed
her
.
<EOS>
There
were
three
schoolrooms
,
all
large
.
<EOS>
That
dedicated
to
the
second
division
,
where
I
was
to
figure
,
was
considerably
the
largest
,
and
accommodated
an
assemblage
more
numerous
,
more
turbulent
,
and
infinitely
more
unmanageable
than
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
In
after
days
,
when
I
knew
the
ground
better
,
I
used
to
think
sometimes
(
if
such
a
comparison
may
be
permitted
)
,
that
the
quiet
,
polished
,
tame
first
division
was
to
the
robust
,
riotous
,
demonstrative
second
division
,
what
the
English
House
of
Lords
is
to
the
House
of
Commons
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
glance
informed
me
that
many
of
the
pupils
were
more
than
girls
 
<EOS>
quite
young
women
<EOS>
;
I
knew
that
some
of
them
were
of
noble
family
(
as
nobility
goes
in
Labassecour
)
,
and
I
was
well
convinced
that
not
one
amongst
them
was
ignorant
of
my
position
in
Madame
's
household
.
<EOS>
As
I
mounted
the
estràde
(
a
low
platform
,
raised
a
step
above
the
flooring
)
,
where
stood
the
teacher
's
chair
and
desk
,
I
beheld
opposite
to
me
a
row
of
eyes
and
brows
that
threatened
stormy
weather
 
<EOS>
eyes
full
of
an
insolent
light
,
and
brows
hard
and
unblushing
as
marble
.
<EOS>
The
continental
"
female
"
is
quite
a
different
being
to
the
insular
"
female
"
of
the
same
age
and
class
<EOS>
:
I
never
saw
such
eyes
and
brows
in
England
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
introduced
me
in
one
cool
phrase
,
sailed
from
the
room
,
and
left
me
alone
in
my
glory
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
that
first
lesson
,
nor
all
the
under
-
current
of
life
and
character
it
opened
up
to
me
.
<EOS>
Then
first
did
I
begin
rightly
to
see
the
wide
difference
that
lies
between
the
novelist
's
and
poet
's
ideal
"
jeune
fille
"
and
the
said
"
jeune
fille
"
as
she
really
is
.
  
<EOS>
It
seems
that
three
titled
belles
in
the
first
row
had
sat
down
predetermined
that
a
_
bonne
d'enfants
_
should
not
give
them
lessons
in
English
.
<EOS>
They
knew
they
had
succeeded
in
expelling
obnoxious
teachers
before
now
;
they
knew
that
Madame
would
at
any
time
throw
overboard
a
professeur
or
maitresse
who
became
unpopular
with
the
school
 
that
she
never
assisted
a
weak
official
to
retain
his
place
 
that
if
he
had
not
strength
to
fight
,
or
tact
to
win
his
way
,
down
he
went
:
looking
at
"
Miss
Snowe
,
"
they
promised
themselves
an
easy
victory
.
  
<EOS>
Mesdemoiselles
Blanche
,
Virginie
,
and
Angélique
opened
the
campaign
by
a
series
of
titterings
and
whisperings
;
these
soon
swelled
into
murmurs
and
short
laughs
,
which
the
remoter
benches
caught
up
and
echoed
more
loudly
.
<EOS>
This
growing
revolt
of
sixty
against
one
,
soon
became
oppressive
enough
;
my
command
of
French
being
so
limited
,
and
exercised
under
such
cruel
constraint
.
  
<EOS>
Could
<EOS>
I
but
have
spoken
in
my
own
tongue
,
I
felt
as
if
I
might
have
gained
a
hearing
;
for
,
in
the
first
place
,
though
I
knew
I
looked
a
poor
creature
,
and
in
many
respects
actually
was
so
,
yet
<EOS>
nature
had
given
me
a
voice
that
could
make
itself
heard
,
if
lifted
in
excitement
or
deepened
by
emotion
.
<EOS>
In
the
second
place
,
while
I
had
no
flow
,
only
a
hesitating
trickle
of
language
,
in
ordinary
circumstances
,
yet
 
under
stimulus
such
as
was
now
rife
through
the
mutinous
mass
 
I
could
,
in
English
,
have
rolled
out
readily
phrases
stigmatizing
their
proceedings
as
such
proceedings
deserved
to
be
stigmatized
;
and
then
with
some
sarcasm
,
flavoured
with
contemptuous
bitterness
for
the
ringleaders
,
and
relieved
with
easy
banter
for
the
weaker
but
less
knavish
followers
<EOS>
,
it
seemed
to
me
that
one
might
possibly
get
command
over
this
wild
herd
,
and
bring
them
into
training
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
All
I
could
now
do
was
to
walk
up
to
Blanche
 
Mademoiselle
de
Melcy
,
a
young
baronne
 
the
eldest
,
tallest
,
handsomest
,
and
most
vicious
 
stand
before
her
desk
,
take
from
under
her
hand
her
exercise
-
book
,
remount
the
estrade
,
deliberately
read
the
composition
,
which
I
found
very
stupid
,
and
,
as
deliberately
,
and
in
the
face
of
the
whole
school
,
tear
the
blotted
page
in
two
.
  
<EOS>
This
action
availed
to
draw
attention
and
check
noise
.
<EOS>
One
girl
alone
,
quite
in
the
background
,
persevered
in
the
riot
with
undiminished
energy
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
her
attentively
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
pale
face
,
hair
like
night
,
broad
strong
eyebrows
,
decided
features
,
and
a
dark
,
mutinous
,
sinister
eye
<EOS>
:
I
noted
that
she
sat
close
by
a
little
door
,
which
door
,
I
was
well
aware
,
opened
into
a
small
closet
where
books
were
kept
.
<EOS>
She
was
standing
up
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
her
clamour
with
freer
energies
.
<EOS>
I
measured
her
stature
and
calculated
her
strength
<EOS>
She
seemed
both
tall
and
wiry
;
but
,
so
the
conflict
were
brief
and
the
attack
unexpected
,
I
thought
I
might
manage
her
.
  
<EOS>
Advancing
up
the
room
,
looking
as
cool
and
careless
as
I
possibly
could
,
in
short
,
_
ayant
l'air
de
rien
_
,
I
slightly
pushed
the
door
and
found
it
was
ajar
.
<EOS>
In
an
instant
,
and
with
sharpness
,
I
had
turned
on
her
.
<EOS>
In
another
instant
she
occupied
the
closet
,
the
door
was
shut
,
and
the
key
in
my
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
It
so
happened
that
this
girl
,
Dolores
by
name
,
and
a
Catalonian
by
race
,
was
the
sort
of
character
at
once
dreaded
and
hated
by
all
her
associates
<EOS>
;
the
act
of
summary
justice
above
noted
proved
popular
:
there
was
not
one
present
but
,
in
her
heart
,
liked
to
see
it
done
.
<EOS>
They
were
stilled
for
a
moment
;
then
a
smile
 
not
a
laugh
 
passed
from
desk
to
desk
:
then
 
when
I
had
gravely
and
tranquilly
returned
to
the
estrade
,
courteously
requested
silence
,
and
commenced
a
dictation
as
if
nothing
at
all
had
happened
 
the
pens
travelled
peacefully
over
the
pages
,
and
the
remainder
of
the
lesson
passed
in
order
and
industry
.
  
<EOS>
"
C'est
bien
,
"
said
Madame
Beck
,
when
I
came
out
of
class
,
hot
and
a
little
exhausted
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ca
ira

"
  
<EOS>
She
had
been
listening
and
peeping
through
a
spy
-
hole
the
whole
time
.
  
<EOS>
From
that
day
I
ceased
to
be
nursery
governess
,
and
became
English
teacher
.
<EOS>
Madame
raised
my
salary
;
but
she
got
thrice
the
work
out
of
me
<EOS>
she
had
extracted
from
Mr.
Wilson
,
at
half
the
expense
.
    
<EOS>
ISIDORE
.
  
<EOS>
My
time
was
now
well
and
profitably
filled
up
.
<EOS>
What
with
teaching
others
and
studying
closely
myself
,
I
had
hardly
a
spare
moment
.
<EOS>
It
was
pleasant
.
<EOS>
I
felt
I
was
getting
,
on
;
not
lying
the
stagnant
prey
of
mould
and
rust
,
but
polishing
my
faculties
and
whetting
them
to
a
keen
edge
with
constant
use
.
<EOS>
Experience
of
a
certain
kind
lay
before
me
,
on
no
narrow
scale
.
<EOS>
Villette
is
a
cosmopolitan
city
,
and
in
this
school
were
girls
of
almost
every
European
nation
,
and
likewise
of
very
varied
rank
in
life
.
<EOS>
Equality
is
much
practised
in
Labassecour
;
though
not
republican
in
form
,
it
is
nearly
so
in
substance
,
and
at
the
desks
of
Madame
Beck
's
establishment
the
young
countess
and
the
young
bourgeoise
sat
side
by
side
.
<EOS>
Nor
could
you
always
by
outward
indications
decide
which
was
noble
and
which
plebeian
;
except
that
,
indeed
,
the
latter
had
often
franker
and
more
courteous
manners
,
while
the
former
bore
away
the
bell
for
a
delicately
-
balanced
combination
of
insolence
and
deceit
.
<EOS>
In
the
former
there
was
often
quick
French
blood
mixed
with
the
marsh
-
phlegm
:
<EOS>
I
regret
to
say
that
the
effect
of
this
vivacious
fluid
chiefly
appeared
in
the
oilier
glibness
with
which
flattery
and
fiction
ran
from
the
tongue
,
and
in
a
manner
lighter
and
livelier
,
but
quite
heartless
and
insincere
.
  
<EOS>
To
do
all
parties
justice
,
the
honest
aboriginal
Labassecouriennes
had
an
hypocrisy
of
their
own
,
too
;
but
it
was
of
a
coarse
order
,
such
as
could
deceive
few
.
<EOS>
Whenever
a
lie
was
necessary
for
their
occasions
,
they
brought
it
out
with
a
careless
ease
and
breadth
altogether
untroubled
by
the
rebuke
of
conscience
.
<EOS>
Not
a
soul
in
Madame
Beck
's
house
,
from
the
scullion
to
the
directress
herself
,
but
was
above
being
ashamed
of
a
lie
<EOS>
;
they
thought
nothing
of
it
:
to
invent
might
not
be
precisely
a
virtue
,
but
it
was
the
most
venial
of
faults
.
"
<EOS>
J'ai
menti
plusieurs
fois
,
"
formed
an
item
of
every
girl
's
and
woman
's
monthly
confession
:
the
priest
heard
unshocked
,
and
absolved
unreluctant
.
<EOS>
If
they
had
missed
going
to
mass
,
or
read
a
chapter
of
a
novel
,
that
was
another
thing
:
these
were
crimes
whereof
rebuke
and
penance
were
the
unfailing
weed
.
  
<EOS>
While
yet
but
half
-
conscious
of
this
state
of
things
,
and
unlearned
in
its
results
,
I
got
on
in
my
new
sphere
very
well
.
<EOS>
After
the
first
few
difficult
lessons
,
given
amidst
peril
and
on
the
edge
of
a
moral
volcano
that
rumbled
under
my
feet
and
sent
sparks
and
hot
fumes
into
my
eyes
,
the
eruptive
spirit
seemed
to
subside
,
as
far
as
I
was
concerned
.
<EOS>
My
mind
was
a
good
deal
bent
on
success
:
I
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
being
baffled
by
mere
undisciplined
disaffection
and
wanton
indocility
,
in
this
first
attempt
to
get
on
in
life
.
<EOS>
Many
hours
of
the
night
I
used
to
lie
awake
,
thinking
what
plan
I
had
best
adopt
to
get
a
reliable
hold
on
these
mutineers
,
to
bring
this
stiff
-
necked
tribe
under
permanent
influence
.
<EOS>
In
,
the
first
place
,
I
saw
plainly
that
aid
in
no
shape
was
to
be
expected
from
Madame
:
her
righteous
plan
was
to
maintain
an
unbroken
popularity
with
the
pupils
,
at
any
and
every
cost
of
justice
or
comfort
to
the
teachers
.
<EOS>
For
a
teacher
to
seek
her
alliance
in
any
crisis
of
insubordination
was
equivalent
to
securing
her
own
expulsion
.
<EOS>
In
intercourse
with
her
pupils
,
Madame
only
took
to
herself
what
was
pleasant
,
amiable
,
and
recommendatory
;
rigidly
requiring
of
her
lieutenants
sufficiency
for
every
annoying
crisis
,
where
to
act
with
adequate
promptitude
was
to
be
unpopular
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
I
must
look
only
to
myself
.
  
<EOS>
Imprimis
 
<EOS>
it
was
clear
as
the
day
that
this
swinish
multitude
were
not
to
be
driven
by
force
.
<EOS>
They
were
to
be
humoured
,
borne
with
very
patiently
:
a
courteous
though
sedate
manner
impressed
them
;
a
very
rare
flash
of
raillery
did
good
.
<EOS>
Severe
or
continuous
mental
application
they
could
not
,
or
would
not
,
bear
:
heavy
demand
on
the
memory
,
the
reason
,
the
attention
<EOS>
,
they
rejected
point
-
blank
.
<EOS>
Where
an
English
girl
of
not
more
than
average
capacity
and
docility
would
quietly
take
a
theme
and
bind
herself
to
the
task
of
comprehension
and
mastery
,
a
Labassecourienne
would
laugh
in
your
face
,
and
throw
it
back
to
you
with
the
phrase
,
 
"
Dieu
,
que
c'est
difficile
!
<EOS>
Je
n'en
veux
pas
.
<EOS>
Cela
m'ennuie
trop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
teacher
who
understood
her
business
would
take
it
back
at
once
,
without
hesitation
,
contest
,
or
expostulation
 
proceed
with
even
exaggerated
care
to
smoothe
every
difficulty
,
to
reduce
it
to
the
level
of
their
understandings
,
return
it
to
them
thus
modified
,
and
lay
on
the
lash
of
sarcasm
with
unsparing
hand
.
<EOS>
They
would
feel
the
sting
,
perhaps
wince
a
little
under
it
;
but
they
bore
no
malice
against
this
sort
of
attack
,
provided
the
sneer
was
not
_
sour
_
,
but
_
hearty
_
,
and
that
it
held
well
up
to
them
,
in
a
clear
,
light
,
and
bold
type
,
so
that
she
who
ran
might
read
,
their
incapacity
,
ignorance
,
and
sloth
.
<EOS>
They
would
riot
for
three
additional
lines
to
a
lesson
;
but
I
never
knew
them
rebel
against
a
wound
given
to
their
self
-
respect
:
the
little
they
had
of
that
quality
was
trained
to
be
crushed
,
and
it
rather
liked
the
pressure
of
a
firm
heel
than
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
as
I
acquired
fluency
and
freedom
in
their
language
,
and
could
make
such
application
of
its
more
nervous
idioms
as
suited
their
case
,
the
elder
and
more
intelligent
girls
began
rather
to
like
me
in
their
way
:
I
noticed
that
whenever
a
pupil
had
been
roused
to
feel
in
her
soul
the
stirring
of
worthy
emulation
,
or
the
quickening
of
honest
shame
,
from
that
date
she
was
won
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
but
once
make
their
(
usually
large
)
ears
burn
under
their
thick
glossy
hair
,
all
was
comparatively
well
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
bouquets
began
to
be
laid
on
my
desk
in
the
morning
;
by
way
of
acknowledgment
for
this
little
foreign
attention
,
I
used
sometimes
to
walk
with
a
select
few
during
recreation
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
conversation
it
befel
once
or
twice
that
I
made
an
unpremeditated
attempt
to
rectify
some
of
their
singularly
distorted
notions
of
principle
;
especially
I
expressed
my
ideas
of
the
evil
and
baseness
of
a
lie
.
<EOS>
In
an
unguarded
moment
,
I
chanced
to
say
that
,
of
the
two
errors
;
I
considered
falsehood
worse
than
an
occasional
lapse
in
church
-
attendance
.
<EOS>
The
poor
girls
were
tutored
to
report
in
Catholic
ears
whatever
the
Protestant
teacher
said
.
<EOS>
An
edifying
consequence
ensued
.
<EOS>
Something
 
an
unseen
,
an
indefinite
,
a
nameless
 
<EOS>
something
stole
between
myself
and
these
my
best
pupils
:
the
bouquets
continued
to
be
offered
,
but
conversation
thenceforth
became
impracticable
.
<EOS>
As
I
paced
the
alleys
or
sat
in
the
berceau
,
a
girl
never
came
to
my
right
hand
but
a
teacher
,
as
if
by
magic
,
appeared
at
my
left
.
<EOS>
Also
,
wonderful
to
relate
,
Madame
's
shoes
of
silence
brought
her
continually
to
my
back
,
as
quick
,
as
noiseless
and
unexpected
,
as
some
wandering
zephyr
.
  
<EOS>
The
opinion
of
my
Catholic
acquaintance
concerning
my
spiritual
prospects
was
somewhat
naïvely
expressed
to
me
on
one
occasion
.
<EOS>
A
pensionnaire
,
to
whom
I
had
rendered
some
little
service
,
exclaimed
one
day
as
she
sat
beside
me
:
"
Mademoiselle
,
what
a
pity
you
are
a
Protestant
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Isabelle
?
"
  
"
Parceque
,
quand
vous
serez
morte
 
vous
brûlerez
tout
de
suite
dans
l'Enfer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Croyez
-
vous
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainement
que
j'y
crois
:
tout
le
monde
le
sait
;
et
d'ailleurs
le
prêtre
me
l'a
dit
.
"
  
<EOS>
Isabelle
was
an
odd
,
blunt
little
creature
.
<EOS>
She
added
,
_
sotto
voce
_
:
"
Pour
assurer
votre
salut
là
-
haut
,
on
ferait
bien
de
vous
brûler
toute
vive
ici
-
bas
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
laughed
,
as
,
indeed
,
it
was
impossible
to
do
otherwise
.
     
<EOS>
Has
the
reader
forgotten
Miss
Ginevra
Fanshawe
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
I
must
be
allowed
to
re
-
introduce
that
young
lady
as
a
thriving
pupil
of
Madame
Beck
's
;
for
such
she
was
.
<EOS>
On
her
arrival
in
the
Rue
Fossette
,
two
or
three
days
after
my
sudden
settlement
there
,
she
encountered
me
with
very
little
surprise
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
had
good
blood
in
her
veins
,
for
never
was
any
duchess
more
perfectly
,
radically
,
unaffectedly
_
nonchalante
_
than
she
:
a
weak
,
transient
amaze
was
all
she
knew
of
the
sensation
of
wonder
.
<EOS>
Most
of
her
other
faculties
seemed
to
be
in
the
same
flimsy
condition
:
her
liking
and
disliking
,
her
love
and
hate
,
were
mere
cobweb
and
gossamer
;
but
she
had
one
thing
about
her
that
seemed
strong
and
durable
enough
,
and
that
was
 
her
selfishness
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
not
proud
;
and
 
_
bonne
d'enfants
_
as
I
was
 
<EOS>
she
would
forthwith
have
made
of
me
a
sort
of
friend
and
confidant
.
<EOS>
She
teased
me
with
a
thousand
vapid
complaints
about
school
-
quarrels
and
household
economy
:
the
cookery
was
not
to
her
taste
;
the
people
about
her
,
teachers
and
pupils
,
she
held
to
be
despicable
,
because
they
were
foreigners
.
<EOS>
I
bore
with
her
abuse
of
the
Friday
's
salt
fish
and
hard
eggs
 
with
her
invective
against
the
soup
,
the
bread
,
the
coffee
 
with
some
patience
for
a
time
;
but
at
last
,
wearied
by
iteration
,
I
turned
crusty
,
and
put
her
to
rights
:
a
thing
I
ought
to
have
done
in
the
very
beginning
,
for
a
salutary
setting
down
always
agreed
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
Much
longer
had
I
to
endure
her
demands
on
me
in
the
way
of
work
.
<EOS>
Her
wardrobe
,
so
far
as
concerned
articles
of
external
wear
,
was
well
and
elegantly
supplied
;
but
there
were
other
habiliments
not
so
carefully
provided
:
what
she
had
,
needed
frequent
repair
.
<EOS>
She
hated
needle
-
drudgery
herself
,
and
she
would
bring
her
hose
,
&
c.
to
me
in
heaps
,
to
be
mended
.
<EOS>
A
compliance
of
some
weeks
threatening
to
result
in
the
establishment
of
an
intolerable
bore
 
I
at
last
distinctly
told
her
she
must
make
up
her
mind
to
mend
her
own
garments
.
<EOS>
She
cried
on
receiving
this
information
,
and
accused
me
of
having
ceased
to
be
her
friend
;
but
I
held
by
my
decision
,
and
let
the
hysterics
pass
as
they
could
.
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
these
foibles
,
and
various
others
needless
to
mention
 
but
by
no
means
of
a
refined
or
elevating
character
 
<EOS>
how
pretty
she
was
!
<EOS>
How
charming
she
looked
,
when
she
came
down
on
a
sunny
Sunday
morning
,
well
-
dressed
and
well
-
humoured
,
robed
in
pale
lilac
silk
,
and
with
her
fair
long
curls
reposing
on
her
white
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Sunday
was
a
holiday
which
she
always
passed
with
friends
resident
in
town
;
and
amongst
these
friends
she
speedily
gave
me
to
understand
was
one
who
would
fain
become
something
more
.
<EOS>
By
glimpses
and
hints
it
was
shown
me
,
and
by
the
general
buoyancy
of
her
look
and
manner
it
was
ere
long
proved
,
that
ardent
admiration
 
perhaps
genuine
love
 
was
at
her
command
.
<EOS>
She
called
her
suitor
"
Isidore
:
"
this
,
however
,
she
intimated
was
not
his
real
name
,
but
one
by
which
it
pleased
her
to
baptize
him
 
his
own
<EOS>
,
she
hinted
,
not
being
"
very
pretty
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Once
,
when
she
had
been
bragging
about
the
vehemence
of
"
Isidore
's
"
attachment
,
I
asked
if
she
loved
him
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
Comme
cela
,
"
said
she
:
"
he
is
handsome
,
and
he
loves
me
to
distraction
,
so
that
I
am
well
amused
.
<EOS>
Ca
suffit
.
"
  
<EOS>
Finding
that
she
carried
the
thing
on
longer
than
,
from
her
very
fickle
tastes
,
I
had
anticipated
,
I
one
day
took
it
upon
me
to
make
serious
inquiries
as
to
whether
the
gentleman
was
such
as
her
parents
,
and
especially
her
uncle
 
<EOS>
on
whom
,
it
appeared
<EOS>
,
she
was
dependent
 
would
be
likely
to
approve
.
<EOS>
She
allowed
that
this
was
very
doubtful
,
as
she
did
not
believe
"
Isidore
"
had
much
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
encourage
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Furieusement
sometimes
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Without
being
certain
that
you
will
be
permitted
to
marry
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
dowdyish
you
are
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
be
married
.
<EOS>
I
am
too
young
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
he
loves
you
as
much
as
you
say
,
and
yet
it
comes
to
nothing
in
the
end
,
he
will
be
made
miserable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
will
break
his
heart
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
shocked
and
,
disappointed
if
he
did
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
this
M.
Isidore
is
a
fool
?
"
said
I.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
,
about
me
;
but
he
is
wise
in
other
things
,
à
ce
qu'on
dit
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
considers
him
extremely
clever
:
she
says
he
will
push
his
way
by
his
talents
;
all
I
know
is
,
that
he
does
little
more
than
sigh
in
my
presence
,
and
that
I
can
wind
him
round
my
little
finger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Wishing
to
get
a
more
definite
idea
of
this
love
-
stricken
M.
Isidore
;
whose
position
seemed
to
me
of
the
least
secure
,
I
requested
her
to
favour
me
with
a
personal
description
;
but
she
could
not
describe
:
she
had
neither
words
nor
the
power
of
putting
them
together
so
as
to
make
graphic
phrases
.
<EOS>
She
even
seemed
not
properly
to
have
noticed
him
:
nothing
of
his
looks
,
of
the
changes
in
his
countenance
,
had
touched
her
heart
or
dwelt
in
her
memory
 
that
he
was
"
beau
,
mais
plutôt
bel
homme
que
joli
garçon
,
"
was
all
she
could
assert
.
<EOS>
My
patience
would
often
have
failed
,
and
my
interest
flagged
,
in
listening
to
her
,
but
for
one
thing
.
<EOS>
All
the
hints
she
dropped
,
all
the
details
she
gave
,
went
unconsciously
to
prove
,
to
my
thinking
,
that
M.
Isidore
's
homage
was
offered
with
great
delicacy
and
respect
.
<EOS>
I
informed
her
very
plainly
that
I
believed
him
much
too
good
for
her
,
and
intimated
with
equal
plainness
my
impression
that
she
was
but
a
vain
coquette
.
<EOS>
She
laughed
,
shook
her
curls
from
her
eyes
,
and
danced
away
as
if
I
had
paid
her
a
compliment
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Ginevra
's
school
-
studies
were
little
better
than
nominal
;
there
were
but
three
things
she
practised
in
earnest
,
viz
.
<EOS>
music
,
singing
,
and
dancing
;
also
embroidering
the
fine
cambric
handkerchiefs
which
she
could
not
afford
to
buy
<EOS>
ready
worked
:
<EOS>
such
mere
trifles
as
lessons
in
history
,
geography
,
grammar
,
and
arithmetic
<EOS>
,
she
left
undone
,
or
got
others
to
do
for
her
.
<EOS>
Very
much
of
her
time
was
spent
in
visiting
.
<EOS>
Madame
,
aware
that
her
stay
at
school
was
now
limited
to
a
certain
period
,
which
would
not
be
extended
whether
she
made
progress
or
not
,
allowed
her
great
licence
in
this
particular
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
 
her
_
chaperon
_
 
<EOS>
a
gay
,
fashionable
lady
,
invited
her
whenever
she
had
company
at
her
own
house
,
and
sometimes
took
her
to
evening
-
parties
at
the
houses
of
her
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
perfectly
approved
this
mode
of
procedure
:
it
had
but
one
inconvenience
;
she
was
obliged
to
be
well
dressed
,
and
she
had
not
money
to
buy
variety
of
dresses
.
<EOS>
All
her
thoughts
turned
on
this
difficulty
;
her
whole
soul
was
occupied
with
expedients
for
effecting
its
solution
.
<EOS>
It
was
wonderful
to
witness
the
activity
of
her
otherwise
indolent
mind
on
this
point
,
and
to
see
the
much
-
daring
intrepidity
to
which
she
was
spurred
by
a
sense
of
necessity
,
and
the
wish
to
shine
.
  
<EOS>
She
begged
boldly
of
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
 
boldly
,
I
say
:
not
with
an
air
of
reluctant
shame
,
but
in
this
strain
:
    
"
My
darling
Mrs.
C.
,
I
have
nothing
in
the
world
fit
to
wear
for
your
party
next
week
;
you
_
must
_
give
me
a
book
-
muslin
dress
,
and
then
a
_
ceinture
bleu
celeste
_
:
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
do
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
there
's
an
angel
!
<EOS>
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
"
darling
Mrs.
C.
"
yielded
at
first
;
but
finding
that
applications
increased
as
they
were
complied
with
,
she
was
soon
obliged
,
like
all
Miss
Fanshawe
's
friends
,
to
oppose
resistance
to
encroachment
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
I
heard
no
more
of
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
's
presents
;
but
still
,
visiting
went
on
,
and
the
absolutely
necessary
dresses
continued
to
be
supplied
:
also
<EOS>
many
little
expensive
<EOS>
_
etcetera
<EOS>
_
 
gloves
,
bouquets
,
even
trinkets
.
<EOS>
These
things
,
contrary
to
her
custom
,
and
even
nature
 
<EOS>
for
she
was
not
secretive
 
<EOS>
were
most
sedulously
kept
out
of
sight
for
a
time
;
but
one
evening
,
when
she
was
going
to
a
large
party
for
which
particular
care
and
elegance
of
costume
were
demanded
,
she
could
not
resist
coming
to
my
chamber
to
show
herself
in
all
her
splendour
.
  
<EOS>
Beautiful
she
looked
:
<EOS>
so
young
,
so
fresh
,
and
with
a
delicacy
of
skin
and
flexibility
of
shape
altogether
English
,
and
not
found
in
the
list
of
continental
female
charms
.
<EOS>
Her
dress
was
new
,
costly
,
and
perfect
.
<EOS>
I
saw
at
a
glance
that
it
lacked
none
of
those
finishing
details
which
cost
so
much
,
and
give
to
the
general
effect
such
an
air
of
tasteful
completeness
.
  
<EOS>
I
viewed
her
from
top
to
toe
.
<EOS>
She
turned
airily
round
that
I
might
survey
her
on
all
sides
.
<EOS>
Conscious
of
her
charms
,
she
was
in
her
best
humour
:
<EOS>
her
rather
small
blue
eyes
sparkled
gleefully
.
<EOS>
She
was
going
to
bestow
on
me
a
kiss
,
in
her
school
-
girl
fashion
of
showing
her
delights
<EOS>
but
I
said
,
"
Steady
!
<EOS>
Let
us
be
Steady
,
and
know
what
we
are
about
,
and
find
out
the
meaning
of
our
magnificence
"
 
and
so
put
her
off
at
arm
's
length
,
to
undergo
cooler
inspection
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
was
her
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
?
"
said
I.
<EOS>
"
There
are
different
ways
of
doing
;
and
,
by
my
word
,
I
do
n't
understand
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
do
I
look
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
look
well
dressed
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
thought
the
praise
not
warm
enough
,
and
proceeded
to
direct
attention
to
the
various
decorative
points
of
her
attire
.
<EOS>
"
Look
at
this
_
parure
_
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
brooch
,
the
ear
-
rings
,
the
bracelets
:
no
one
in
the
school
has
such
a
set
 
not
Madame
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
them
all
.
"
<EOS>
(
Pause
.
)
<EOS>
"
Did
M.
de
Bassompierre
give
you
those
jewels
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
knows
nothing
about
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Were
they
presents
from
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
they
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
is
a
mean
,
stingy
creature
;
she
never
gives
me
anything
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
did
not
choose
to
ask
any
further
questions
,
but
turned
abruptly
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
old
Crusty
 
old
Diogenes
"
(
these
were
her
familiar
terms
for
me
when
we
disagreed
)
,
"
what
is
the
matter
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
yourself
away
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
pleasure
in
looking
at
you
or
your
_
parure
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
For
an
instant
,
she
seemed
taken
by
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
now
,
Mother
Wisdom
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
got
into
debt
for
it
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
not
for
the
jewels
,
nor
the
gloves
,
nor
the
bouquet
.
<EOS>
My
dress
is
certainly
not
paid
for
,
but
uncle
de
Bassompierre
will
pay
it
in
the
bill
:
he
never
notices
items
,
but
just
looks
at
the
total
;
and
he
is
so
rich
,
one
need
not
care
about
a
few
guineas
more
or
less
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
go
?
<EOS>
I
want
to
shut
the
door
....
<EOS>
Ginevra
,
people
may
tell
you
you
are
very
handsome
in
that
ball
-
attire
;
but
,
in
_
my
_
eyes
,
you
will
never
look
so
pretty
as
you
did
in
the
gingham
gown
and
plain
straw
bonnet
<EOS>
you
wore
when
I
first
saw
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Other
people
have
not
your
puritanical
tastes
,
"
was
her
angry
reply
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
besides
,
I
see
no
right
you
have
to
sermonize
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Certainly
!
<EOS>
I
have
little
right
;
and
you
,
perhaps
,
have
still
less
to
come
flourishing
and
fluttering
into
my
chamber
 
<EOS>
a
mere
jay
in
borrowed
plumes
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
least
respect
for
your
feathers
,
Miss
Fanshawe
;
and
especially
the
peacock
's
eyes
<EOS>
you
call
a
_
parure
_
:
very
pretty
things
,
if
you
had
bought
them
with
money
which
was
your
own
,
and
which
you
could
well
spare
,
but
not
at
all
pretty
under
present
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
est
là
pour
Mademoiselle
Fanshawe
!
"
was
announced
by
the
portress
,
and
away
she
tripped
.
  
<EOS>
This
semi
-
mystery
of
the
_
parure
<EOS>
_
was
not
solved
till
two
or
three
days
afterwards
,
when
she
came
to
make
a
voluntary
confession
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
be
sulky
with
me
,
"
she
began
,
"
in
the
idea
that
I
am
running
somebody
,
papa
or
M.
de
Bassompierre
,
deeply
into
debt
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
nothing
remains
unpaid
for
,
but
the
few
dresses
I
have
lately
had
:
all
the
rest
is
settled
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
I
thought
,
"
lies
the
mystery
;
considering
that
they
were
not
given
you
by
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
,
and
that
your
own
means
are
limited
to
a
few
shillings
,
of
which
I
know
you
to
be
excessively
careful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ecoutez
!
"
<EOS>
she
went
on
,
drawing
near
and
speaking
in
her
most
confidential
and
coaxing
tone
;
for
my
"
sulkiness
"
was
inconvenient
to
her
:
she
liked
me
to
be
in
a
talking
and
listening
mood
,
even
if
I
only
talked
to
chide
and
listened
to
rail
.
<EOS>
"
Ecoutez
,
chère
grogneuse
!
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
all
how
and
about
it
;
and
you
will
then
see
,
not
only
how
right
the
whole
thing
is
,
but
how
cleverly
managed
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
I
_
must
_
go
out
.
<EOS>
Papa
himself
said
that
he
wished
me
to
see
something
of
the
world
;
he
particularly
remarked
to
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
,
that
,
though
I
was
a
sweet
creature
enough
,
I
had
rather
a
bread
-
and
-
butter
-
eating
,
school
-
girl
air
;
of
which
it
was
his
special
desire
that
I
should
get
rid
,
by
an
introduction
to
society
here
,
before
I
make
my
regular
début
in
England
.
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
if
I
go
out
,
I
_
must
_
dress
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
is
turned
shabby
,
and
will
give
nothing
more
;
it
would
be
too
hard
upon
uncle
to
make
him
pay
for
_
<EOS>
all
_
<EOS>
the
things
I
need
:
_
<EOS>
that
_
<EOS>
you
ca
n't
deny
 
_
that
_
agrees
with
your
own
preachments
.
<EOS>
Well
,
but
SOMEBODY
who
heard
me
(
quite
by
chance
,
I
assure
you
)
complaining
to
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
of
my
distressed
circumstances
,
and
what
straits
I
was
put
to
for
an
ornament
or
two
 
_
<EOS>
somebody
_
,
far
from
grudging
one
a
present
,
was
quite
delighted
at
the
idea
of
being
permitted
to
offer
some
trifle
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
seen
what
a
_
blanc
-
bec
_
he
looked
when
he
first
spoke
of
it
:
how
he
hesitated
and
blushed
,
and
positively
trembled
from
fear
of
a
repulse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
will
do
,
Miss
Fanshawe
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
am
to
understand
that
M.
Isidore
is
the
benefactor
:
that
it
is
from
him
you
have
accepted
that
costly
_
parure
_
;
that
he
supplies
your
bouquets
and
your
gloves
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
express
yourself
so
disagreeably
,
"
said
she
,
"
one
hardly
knows
how
to
answer
;
what
I
mean
to
say
is
,
that
I
occasionally
allow
Isidore
the
pleasure
and
honour
of
expressing
his
homage
by
the
offer
of
a
trifle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
comes
to
the
same
thing
....
<EOS>
Now
,
Ginevra
,
to
speak
the
plain
truth
,
I
do
n't
very
well
understand
these
matters
;
but
I
believe
you
are
doing
very
wrong
 
seriously
wrong
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
however
,
you
now
feel
certain
that
you
will
be
able
to
marry
M.
Isidore
;
your
parents
and
uncle
have
given
their
consent
,
and
,
for
your
part
,
you
love
him
entirely
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mais
pas
du
tout
!
"
<EOS>
(
she
always
had
recourse
to
French
when
about
to
say
something
specially
heartless
and
perverse
)
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Je
suis
sa
reine
,
mais
il
n'est
pas
mon
roi
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
I
must
believe
this
language
is
mere
nonsense
and
coquetry
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
great
about
you
,
yet
you
are
above
profiting
by
the
good
nature
and
purse
of
a
man
to
whom
you
feel
absolute
indifference
.
<EOS>
You
love
M.
Isidore
far
more
than
you
think
,
or
will
avow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
I
danced
with
a
young
officer
the
other
night
,
whom
I
love
a
thousand
times
more
than
he
.
<EOS>
I
often
wonder
why
I
feel
so
very
cold
to
Isidore
,
for
everybody
says
he
is
handsome
,
and
other
ladies
admire
him
;
but
,
somehow
,
he
bores
me
:
let
me
see
now
how
it
is
....
"
  
<EOS>
And
she
seemed
to
make
an
effort
to
reflect
.
<EOS>
In
this
I
encouraged
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
"
I
said
,
"
try
to
get
a
clear
idea
of
the
state
of
your
mind
.
<EOS>
To
me
it
seems
in
a
great
mess
 
chaotic
as
a
rag
-
bag
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
something
in
this
fashion
,
"
she
cried
out
ere
long
:
"
the
man
is
too
romantic
and
devoted
,
and
he
expects
something
more
of
me
than
I
find
it
convenient
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
thinks
I
am
perfect
:
furnished
with
all
sorts
of
sterling
qualities
and
solid
virtues
,
such
as
I
never
had
,
nor
intend
to
have
.
<EOS>
Now
,
one
ca
n't
help
,
in
his
presence
,
rather
trying
to
justify
his
good
opinion
;
and
it
does
so
tire
one
to
be
goody
,
and
to
talk
sense
,
 
for
he
really
thinks
I
am
sensible
.
<EOS>
I
am
far
more
at
my
ease
with
you
,
old
lady
 
<EOS>
you
,
you
dear
crosspatch
 
who
take
me
at
my
lowest
,
and
know
me
to
be
coquettish
,
and
ignorant
,
and
flirting
,
and
fickle
,
and
silly
,
and
selfish
,
and
all
the
other
sweet
things
you
and
I
have
agreed
to
be
a
part
of
my
character
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
all
very
well
,
"
I
said
,
making
a
strenuous
effort
to
preserve
that
gravity
and
severity
which
ran
risk
of
being
shaken
by
this
whimsical
candour
,
"
but
it
does
not
alter
that
wretched
business
of
the
presents
.
<EOS>
Pack
them
up
,
Ginevra
,
like
a
good
,
honest
girl
,
and
send
them
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
I
wo
n't
,
"
said
she
,
stoutly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
deceiving
M.
Isidore
.
<EOS>
It
stands
to
reason
that
by
accepting
his
presents
you
give
him
to
understand
he
will
one
day
receive
an
equivalent
,
in
your
regard
...
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
he
wo
n't
,
"
she
interrupted
:
"
he
has
his
equivalent
now
,
in
the
pleasure
of
seeing
me
wear
them
 
quite
enough
for
him
:
he
is
only
bourgeois
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
phrase
,
in
its
senseless
arrogance
,
quite
cured
me
of
the
temporary
weakness
which
had
made
me
relax
my
tone
and
aspect
.
<EOS>
She
rattled
on
:
  
"
My
present
business
is
to
enjoy
youth
,
and
not
to
think
of
fettering
myself
,
by
promise
or
vow
,
to
this
man
or
that
.
<EOS>
When
first
I
saw
Isidore
,
I
believed
he
would
help
me
to
enjoy
it
<EOS>
I
believed
he
would
be
content
with
my
being
a
pretty
girl
;
and
that
we
should
meet
and
part
and
flutter
about
like
two
butterflies
,
and
be
happy
.
<EOS>
Lo
,
and
behold
!
<EOS>
I
find
him
at
times
as
grave
as
a
judge
,
and
deep
-
feeling
and
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
Bah
!
<EOS>
Les
penseurs
,
les
hommes
profonds
et
passionnés
ne
sont
pas
à
mon
goût
.
<EOS>
Le
Colonel
Alfred
de
Hamal
suits
me
far
better
.
<EOS>
Va
pour
les
beaux
fats
<EOS>
et
les
jolis
fripons
!
<EOS>
Vive
les
joies
<EOS>
et
les
plaisirs
!
<EOS>
A
bas
les
grandes
passions
et
les
sévères
vertus
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
for
an
answer
to
this
tirade
.
<EOS>
I
gave
none
.
  
<EOS>
"
J'aime
mon
beau
Colonel
,
"
she
went
on
:
"
<EOS>
je
n'aimerai
jamais
son
rival
.
<EOS>
Je
ne
<EOS>
serai
jamais
femme
de
bourgeois
,
moi
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
now
signified
that
it
was
imperatively
necessary
my
apartment
should
be
relieved
of
the
honour
of
her
presence
:
she
went
away
laughing
.
    
<EOS>
DR
JOHN
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
was
a
most
consistent
character
;
forbearing
with
all
the
world
,
and
tender
to
no
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
Her
own
children
drew
her
into
no
deviation
from
the
even
tenor
of
her
stoic
calm
.
<EOS>
She
was
solicitous
about
her
family
,
vigilant
for
their
interests
and
physical
well
-
being
;
but
she
never
seemed
to
know
the
wish
to
take
her
little
children
upon
her
lap
,
to
press
their
rosy
lips
with
her
own
,
to
gather
them
in
a
genial
embrace
,
to
shower
on
them
softly
the
benignant
caress
,
the
loving
word
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
watched
her
sometimes
sitting
in
the
garden
,
viewing
the
little
bees
afar
off
,
as
they
walked
in
a
distant
alley
with
Trinette
,
their
_
bonne
_
;
in
her
mien
spoke
care
and
prudence
.
<EOS>
I
know
she
often
pondered
anxiously
what
she
called
"
leur
avenir
;
"
but
if
the
youngest
,
a
puny
and
delicate
but
engaging
child
,
chancing
to
spy
her
,
broke
from
its
nurse
,
and
toddling
down
the
walk
,
came
all
eager
and
laughing
and
panting
to
clasp
her
knee
,
Madame
would
just
calmly
put
out
one
hand
,
so
as
to
prevent
inconvenient
concussion
from
the
child
's
sudden
onset
:
"
Prends
garde
,
mon
enfant
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
would
say
unmoved
,
patiently
permit
it
to
stand
near
her
a
few
moments
,
and
then
,
without
smile
or
kiss
,
or
endearing
syllable
,
rise
and
lead
it
back
to
Trinette
.
  
<EOS>
Her
demeanour
to
the
eldest
girl
was
equally
characteristic
in
another
way
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
vicious
child
.
"
<EOS>
Quelle
peste
que
cette
<EOS>
Désirée
!
<EOS>
Quel
poison
que
cet
enfant
là
!
"
were
the
expressions
dedicated
to
her
,
alike
in
kitchen
and
in
schoolroom
.
<EOS>
Amongst
her
other
endowments
she
boasted
an
exquisite
skill
in
the
art
,
of
provocation
,
sometimes
driving
her
_
bonne
_
and
the
servants
almost
wild
.
<EOS>
She
would
steal
to
their
attics
,
open
their
drawers
and
boxes
,
wantonly
tear
their
best
caps
and
soil
their
best
shawls
;
she
would
watch
her
opportunity
to
get
at
the
buffet
of
the
salle
-
à
-
manger
,
where
she
would
smash
articles
of
porcelain
or
glass
 
or
to
the
cupboard
of
the
storeroom
,
where
she
would
plunder
the
preserves
,
drink
the
sweet
wine
,
break
jars
and
bottles
,
and
so
contrive
as
to
throw
the
onus
of
suspicion
on
the
cook
and
the
kitchen
-
maid
.
<EOS>
All
this
when
Madame
saw
,
and
of
which
when
she
received
report
,
her
sole
observation
,
uttered
with
matchless
serenity
,
was
:
  
"
Désirée
a
besoin
d'une
surveillance
toute
particulière
.
"
<EOS>
Accordingly
she
kept
this
promising
olive
-
branch
a
good
deal
at
her
side
.
<EOS>
Never
once
,
I
believe
,
did
she
tell
her
faithfully
of
her
faults
,
explain
the
evil
of
such
habits
,
and
show
the
results
which
must
thence
ensue
.
<EOS>
Surveillance
must
work
the
whole
cure
.
<EOS>
It
failed
of
course
.
<EOS>
Désirée
was
kept
in
some
measure
from
the
servants
,
but
she
teased
and
pillaged
her
mamma
instead
.
<EOS>
Whatever
belonging
to
Madame
's
work
-
table
or
toilet
she
could
lay
her
hands
on
,
she
stole
and
hid
.
<EOS>
Madame
saw
all
this
,
but
she
still
pretended
not
to
see
:
she
had
not
rectitude
of
soul
to
confront
the
child
with
her
vices
.
<EOS>
When
an
article
disappeared
whose
value
rendered
restitution
necessary
,
she
would
profess
to
think
that
Désirée
had
taken
it
away
in
play
,
and
beg
her
to
restore
it
.
<EOS>
Désirée
was
not
to
be
so
cheated
:
she
had
learned
to
bring
falsehood
to
the
aid
of
theft
,
and
would
deny
having
touched
the
brooch
,
ring
,
or
scissors
.
<EOS>
Carrying
on
the
hollow
system
,
the
mother
would
calmly
assume
an
air
of
belief
,
and
afterwards
ceaselessly
watch
and
dog
the
child
till
she
tracked
her
:
to
her
hiding
-
places
 
some
hole
in
the
garden
-
wall
 
<EOS>
some
chink
or
cranny
in
garret
or
out
-
house
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
Madame
would
send
Désirée
out
for
a
walk
with
her
_
bonne
_
,
and
profit
by
her
absence
to
rob
the
robber
.
<EOS>
Désirée
proved
herself
the
true
daughter
of
her
astute
parent
,
by
never
suffering
either
her
countenance
or
manner
to
betray
the
least
sign
of
mortification
on
discovering
the
loss
.
  
<EOS>
The
second
child
,
Fifine
,
was
said
to
be
like
its
dead
father
.
<EOS>
Certainly
,
though
the
mother
had
given
it
her
healthy
frame
,
her
blue
eye
and
ruddy
cheek
,
not
from
her
was
derived
its
moral
being
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
honest
,
gleeful
little
soul
:
<EOS>
a
passionate
,
warm
-
tempered
,
bustling
creature
it
was
too
,
and
of
the
sort
likely
to
blunder
often
into
perils
and
difficulties
.
<EOS>
One
day
it
bethought
itself
to
fall
from
top
to
bottom
of
a
steep
flight
of
stone
steps
;
and
when
Madame
,
hearing
the
noise
(
she
always
heard
every
noise
)
,
issued
from
the
salle
-
à
-
manger
and
picked
it
up
<EOS>
,
she
said
quietly
,
 
<EOS>
"
Cet
enfant
a
un
os
cassé
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
first
we
hoped
this
was
not
the
case
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
however
,
but
too
true
:
one
little
plump
arm
hung
powerless
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
Meess
"
(
meaning
me
)
<EOS>
"
take
her
,
"
said
Madame
;
"
et
<EOS>
qu'on
aille
tout
de
suite
chercher
un
fiacre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
a
_
fiacre
_
she
promptly
,
but
with
admirable
coolness
and
self
-
possession
,
departed
to
fetch
a
surgeon
.
  
<EOS>
It
appeared
she
did
not
find
the
family
-
surgeon
at
home
;
but
that
mattered
not
:
she
sought
until
she
laid
her
hand
on
a
substitute
to
her
mind
,
and
brought
him
back
with
her
.
<EOS>
Meantime
I
had
cut
the
child
's
sleeve
from
its
arm
,
undressed
and
put
it
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
We
none
of
us
,
I
suppose
(
by
_
<EOS>
we
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
mean
the
bonne
,
the
cook
,
the
portress
,
and
myself
,
all
which
personages
were
now
gathered
in
the
small
and
heated
chamber
)
,
looked
very
scrutinizingly
at
the
new
doctor
when
he
came
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
,
at
least
,
was
taken
up
with
endeavouring
to
soothe
Fifine
;
whose
cries
(
for
she
had
good
lungs
)
<EOS>
were
appalling
to
hear
.
<EOS>
These
cries
redoubled
in
intensity
as
the
stranger
approached
her
bed
;
when
he
took
her
up
,
"
Let
alone
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
passionately
,
in
her
broken
English
(
for
she
spoke
English
as
did
the
other
children
)
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
you
:
I
will
Dr.
Pillule
!
"
  
"
And
Dr.
Pillule
is
my
very
good
friend
,
"
was
the
answer
,
in
perfect
English
;
"
but
he
is
busy
at
a
place
three
leagues
off
,
and
I
am
come
in
his
stead
.
<EOS>
So
now
,
when
we
get
a
little
calmer
,
we
must
commence
business
;
and
we
will
soon
have
that
unlucky
little
arm
bandaged
and
in
right
order
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hereupon
he
called
for
a
glass
of
_
eau
sucrée
_
,
fed
her
with
some
teaspoonfuls
of
the
sweet
liquid
<EOS>
(
Fifine
was
a
frank
gourmande
;
anybody
could
win
her
heart
through
her
palate
)
,
promised
her
more
when
the
operation
should
be
over
,
and
promptly
went
to
work
.
<EOS>
Some
assistance
being
needed
,
he
demanded
it
of
the
cook
,
a
robust
,
strong
-
armed
woman
;
but
she
,
the
portress
,
and
the
nurse
instantly
fled
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
like
to
touch
that
small
,
tortured
limb
,
but
thinking
there
was
no
alternative
,
my
hand
was
already
extended
to
do
what
was
requisite
.
<EOS>
I
was
anticipated
;
Madame
Beck
had
put
out
her
own
hand
:
hers
was
steady
while
mine
trembled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ca
vaudra
mieux
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
turning
from
me
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
showed
wisdom
in
his
choice
.
<EOS>
Mine
would
have
been
feigned
stoicism
,
forced
fortitude
.
<EOS>
Hers
was
neither
forced
nor
feigned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Merci

Madame

said
the
operator
when
he
had
finished
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Voilà
un

opportun

<EOS>
He
was
pleased
with
her
firmness
,
<EOS>
she
with
his
compliment
.
<EOS>
It
was
likely
,
too
,
<EOS>
that
his
whole
general
appearance
,
his
voice
,
mien
,
and
manner
,
wrought
impressions
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
when
you
looked
well
at
him
,
and
when
a
lamp
was
brought
in
 
for
it
was
evening
and
now
waxing
dusk
 
<EOS>
you
saw
that
,
unless
Madame
Beck
had
been
less
than
woman
,
it
could
not
well
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
This
young
doctor
(
he
_
was
_
young
)
had
no
common
aspect
.
<EOS>
His
stature
looked
imposingly
tall
in
that
little
chamber
,
and
amidst
that
group
of
Dutch
-
made
women
;
his
profile
was
clear
,
fine
and
expressive
:
perhaps
his
eye
glanced
from
face
to
face
rather
too
vividly
,
too
quickly
,
and
too
often
;
but
it
had
a
most
pleasant
character
,
and
so
had
his
mouth
;
his
chin
was
full
,
cleft
,
Grecian
,
and
perfect
.
<EOS>
As
to
his
smile
,
one
could
not
in
a
hurry
make
up
one
's
mind
as
to
the
descriptive
epithet
it
merited
;
there
was
something
in
it
that
pleased
,
but
something
too
that
brought
surging
up
into
the
mind
all
one
's
foibles
and
weak
points
:
all
that
could
lay
one
open
to
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
Yet
Fifine
liked
this
doubtful
smile
,
and
thought
the
owner
genial
:
much
as
he
had
hurt
her
,
she
held
out
her
hand
to
bid
him
a
friendly
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
He
patted
the
little
hand
kindly
,
and
then
he
and
Madame
went
down
-
stairs
together
;
she
talking
in
her
highest
tide
of
spirits
and
volubility
,
he
listening
with
an
air
of
good
-
natured
amenity
,
dashed
with
that
unconscious
roguish
<EOS>
archness
<EOS>
I
find
it
difficult
to
describe
.
  
<EOS>
I
noticed
that
though
he
spoke
French
well
,
he
spoke
English
better
;
he
had
,
too
,
an
English
complexion
,
eyes
,
and
form
.
<EOS>
I
noticed
more
.
<EOS>
As
he
passed
me
in
leaving
the
room
,
turning
his
face
in
my
direction
one
moment
 
not
to
address
me
,
but
to
speak
to
Madame
,
yet
so
standing
,
that
I
almost
necessarily
looked
up
at
him
 
a
recollection
which
had
been
struggling
to
form
in
my
memory
,
since
the
first
moment
I
heard
his
voice
,
started
up
perfected
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
very
gentleman
to
whom
I
had
spoken
at
the
bureau
;
who
had
helped
me
in
the
matter
of
the
trunk
;
who
had
been
my
guide
through
the
dark
,
wet
park
.
<EOS>
Listening
,
as
he
passed
down
the
long
vestibule
out
into
the
street
,
I
recognised
his
very
tread
:
it
was
the
same
firm
and
equal
stride
<EOS>
I
had
followed
under
the
dripping
trees
.
     
<EOS>
It
was
,
to
be
concluded
that
this
young
surgeon
-
physician
's
first
visit
to
the
Rue
Fossette
would
be
the
last
.
<EOS>
The
respectable
Dr.
Pillule
being
expected
home
the
next
day
,
there
appeared
no
reason
why
his
temporary
substitute
should
again
represent
him
;
but
the
Fates
had
written
their
decree
to
the
contrary
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Pillule
had
been
summoned
to
see
a
rich
old
hypochondriac
at
the
antique
university
town
of
Bouquin
-
Moisi
,
and
upon
his
prescribing
change
of
air
and
travel
as
remedies
,
he
was
retained
to
accompany
the
timid
patient
on
a
tour
of
some
weeks
;
it
but
remained
,
therefore
,
for
the
new
doctor
to
continue
his
attendance
at
the
Rue
Fossette
.
  
<EOS>
I
often
saw
him
when
he
came
;
for
Madame
would
not
trust
the
little
invalid
to
Trinette
,
but
required
me
to
spend
much
of
my
time
in
the
nursery
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
was
skilful
.
<EOS>
Fifine
recovered
rapidly
under
his
care
,
yet
even
her
convalescence
did
not
hasten
his
dismissal
.
<EOS>
Destiny
and
Madame
Beck
seemed
in
league
,
and
both
had
ruled
that
he
should
make
deliberate
acquaintance
with
the
vestibule
,
the
private
staircase
and
upper
chambers
of
the
Rue
Fossette
.
  
<EOS>
No
sooner
did
Fifine
emerge
from
his
hands
than
Désirée
declared
herself
ill
.
<EOS>
That
possessed
child
had
a
genius
for
simulation
,
and
captivated
by
the
attentions
and
indulgences
of
a
sick
-
room
<EOS>
,
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
an
illness
would
perfectly
accommodate
her
tastes
,
and
took
her
bed
accordingly
.
<EOS>
She
acted
well
,
and
her
mother
still
better
;
for
while
the
whole
case
was
transparent
to
Madame
Beck
as
the
day
,
she
treated
it
with
an
astonishingly
well
-
assured
air
of
gravity
and
good
faith
.
  
<EOS>
What
surprised
me
was
,
that
Dr.
John
(
so
the
young
Englishman
had
taught
Fifine
to
call
him
,
and
we
all
took
from
her
the
habit
of
addressing
him
by
this
name
,
till
it
became
an
established
custom
,
and
he
was
known
by
no
other
in
the
Rue
Fossette
)
 
<EOS>
that
Dr.
John
consented
tacitly
to
adopt
Madame
's
tactics
,
and
to
fall
in
with
her
manoeuvres
.
<EOS>
He
betrayed
,
indeed
,
a
period
of
comic
doubt
,
cast
one
or
two
rapid
glances
from
the
child
to
the
mother
,
indulged
in
an
interval
of
self
-
consultation
,
but
finally
resigned
himself
with
a
good
grace
to
play
his
part
in
the
farce
.
<EOS>
Désirée
eat
like
a
raven
,
gambolled
day
and
night
in
her
bed
,
pitched
tents
with
the
sheets
and
blankets
,
lounged
like
a
Turk
amidst
pillows
and
bolsters
,
diverted
herself
with
throwing
her
shoes
at
her
bonne
and
grimacing
at
her
sisters
 
over
-
flowed
,
in
short
,
with
unmerited
health
and
evil
spirits
;
only
languishing
when
her
mamma
and
the
physician
paid
their
diurnal
visit
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
,
I
knew
,
was
glad
,
at
any
price
,
to
have
her
daughter
in
bed
out
of
the
way
of
mischief
;
but
I
wondered
that
Dr.
John
did
not
tire
of
the
business
.
  
<EOS>
Every
day
,
on
this
mere
pretext
of
a
motive
,
he
gave
punctual
attendance
;
Madame
always
received
him
with
the
same
empressement
,
the
same
sunshine
for
himself
,
the
same
admirably
counterfeited
air
of
concern
for
her
child
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
wrote
harmless
prescriptions
for
the
patient
,
and
viewed
her
mother
with
a
shrewdly
sparkling
eye
.
<EOS>
Madame
caught
his
rallying
looks
without
resenting
them
 
<EOS>
she
had
too
much
good
sense
for
that
.
<EOS>
Supple
as
the
young
doctor
seemed
,
one
could
not
despise
him
 
this
pliant
part
was
evidently
not
adopted
in
the
design
to
curry
favour
with
his
employer
:
while
he
liked
his
office
at
the
pensionnat
,
and
lingered
strangely
about
the
Rue
Fossette
,
he
was
independent
,
almost
careless
in
his
carriage
there
;
and
yet
,
too
,
he
was
often
thoughtful
and
preoccupied
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
perhaps
my
business
to
observe
the
mystery
of
his
bearing
,
or
search
out
its
origin
or
aim
;
but
,
placed
as
I
was
,
I
could
hardly
help
it
.
<EOS>
He
laid
himself
open
to
my
observation
,
according
to
my
presence
in
the
room
just
that
degree
of
notice
and
consequence
a
person
of
my
exterior
habitually
expects
:
that
is
to
say
,
about
what
is
given
to
unobtrusive
articles
of
furniture
,
chairs
of
ordinary
joiner
's
work
,
and
carpets
of
no
striking
pattern
.
<EOS>
Often
,
while
waiting
for
Madame
,
he
would
muse
,
smile
,
watch
,
or
listen
like
a
man
who
thinks
himself
alone
.
<EOS>
I
,
meantime
,
was
free
to
puzzle
over
his
countenance
and
movements
,
and
wonder
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
that
peculiar
interest
and
attachment
 
all
mixed
up
with
doubt
and
strangeness
,
and
inexplicably
ruled
by
some
presiding
spell
 
which
wedded
him
to
this
demi
-
convent
,
secluded
in
the
built
-
up
core
of
a
capital
.
<EOS>
He
,
I
believe
,
never
remembered
that
I
had
eyes
in
my
head
,
much
less
a
brain
behind
them
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
would
he
ever
have
found
this
out
,
but
that
one
day
,
while
he
sat
in
the
sunshine
and
I
was
observing
the
colouring
of
his
hair
,
whiskers
,
and
complexion
 
<EOS>
the
whole
being
of
such
a
tone
as
a
strong
light
brings
out
with
somewhat
perilous
force
(
indeed
I
recollect
I
was
driven
to
compare
his
beamy
head
in
my
thoughts
to
that
of
the
"
golden
image
"
which
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
had
set
up
)
,
an
idea
new
,
sudden
,
and
startling
,
riveted
my
attention
with
an
over
-
mastering
strength
and
power
of
attraction
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
to
this
day
how
I
looked
at
him
:
<EOS>
the
force
of
surprise
,
and
also
of
conviction
,
made
me
forget
myself
;
and
I
only
recovered
wonted
consciousness
when
I
saw
that
his
notice
was
arrested
,
and
that
it
had
caught
my
movement
in
a
clear
little
oval
mirror
fixed
in
the
side
of
the
window
recess
 
by
the
aid
of
which
<EOS>
reflector
Madame
often
secretly
spied
persons
walking
in
the
garden
below
.
<EOS>
Though
of
so
gay
and
sanguine
a
temperament
,
he
was
not
without
a
certain
nervous
sensitiveness
which
made
him
ill
at
ease
under
a
direct
,
inquiring
gaze
.
<EOS>
On
surprising
me
thus
,
he
turned
and
said
,
in
a
tone
which
,
though
courteous
,
had
just
so
much
dryness
in
it
as
to
mark
a
shade
of
annoyance
,
as
well
as
to
give
to
what
was
said
the
character
of
rebuke
,
"
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
does
not
spare
me
:
I
am
not
vain
enough
to
fancy
that
it
is
my
merits
which
attract
her
attention
;
it
must
then
be
some
defect
.
<EOS>
Dare
<EOS>
I
ask
 
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
confounded
,
as
the
reader
may
suppose
,
yet
not
with
an
irrecoverable
confusion
;
being
conscious
that
it
was
from
no
emotion
of
incautious
admiration
,
nor
yet
in
a
spirit
of
unjustifiable
inquisitiveness
,
that
I
had
incurred
this
reproof
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
cleared
myself
on
the
spot
,
but
would
not
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
speak
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
in
the
habit
of
speaking
to
him
.
<EOS>
Suffering
him
,
then
,
to
think
what
he
chose
and
accuse
me
of
what
he
would
,
I
resumed
some
work
I
had
dropped
,
and
kept
my
head
bent
over
it
during
the
remainder
of
his
stay
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
perverse
mood
of
the
mind
which
is
rather
soothed
than
irritated
by
misconstruction
;
and
in
quarters
where
we
can
never
be
rightly
known
,
we
take
pleasure
,
I
think
,
in
being
consummately
ignored
.
<EOS>
What
honest
man
,
on
being
casually
taken
for
a
housebreaker
,
does
not
feel
rather
tickled
than
vexed
at
the
mistake
?
    
<EOS>
THE
PORTRESS
'S
CABINET
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
summer
and
very
hot
.
<EOS>
Georgette
,
the
youngest
of
Madame
Beck
's
children
,
took
a
fever
.
<EOS>
Désirée
,
suddenly
cured
of
her
ailments
,
was
,
together
with
Fifine
,
packed
off
to
Bonne
-
Maman
,
in
the
country
,
by
way
of
precaution
against
infection
.
<EOS>
Medical
aid
was
now
really
needed
,
and
Madame
,
choosing
to
ignore
the
return
of
Dr.
Pillule
,
who
had
been
at
home
a
week
,
conjured
his
English
rival
to
continue
his
visits
.
<EOS>
One
or
two
of
the
pensionnaires
complained
of
headache
,
and
in
other
respects
seemed
slightly
to
participate
in
Georgette
's
ailment
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
at
last
,
"
I
thought
,
"
Dr.
Pillule
must
be
recalled
:
the
prudent
directress
will
never
venture
to
permit
the
attendance
of
so
young
a
man
on
the
pupils
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
directress
was
very
prudent
,
but
she
could
also
be
intrepidly
venturous
.
<EOS>
She
actually
introduced
Dr.
John
to
the
school
-
division
of
the
premises
,
and
established
him
in
attendance
on
the
proud
and
handsome
Blanche
de
Melcy
,
and
the
vain
,
flirting
Angélique
,
her
friend
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
,
I
thought
,
testified
a
certain
gratification
at
this
mark
of
confidence
;
and
if
discretion
of
bearing
could
have
justified
the
step
,
it
would
by
him
have
been
amply
justified
.
<EOS>
Here
,
however
,
in
this
land
of
convents
and
confessionals
,
such
a
presence
as
his
was
not
to
be
suffered
with
impunity
in
a
"
pensionnat
de
demoiselles
.
<EOS>
"
The
school
gossiped
,
the
kitchen
whispered
,
the
town
caught
the
rumour
,
parents
wrote
letters
and
paid
visits
of
remonstrance
.
<EOS>
Madame
,
had
she
been
weak
,
would
now
have
been
lost
:
a
dozen
rival
educational
houses
were
ready
to
improve
this
false
step
 
if
false
step
it
were
 
to
her
ruin
;
but
Madame
was
not
weak
,
and
little
Jesuit
though
she
might
be
,
yet
I
clapped
the
hands
of
my
heart
,
and
with
its
voice
cried
"
brava
!
"
<EOS>
as
I
watched
her
able
bearing
,
her
skilled
management
,
her
temper
and
her
firmness
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
She
met
the
alarmed
parents
with
a
good
-
humoured
,
easy
grace
for
nobody
matched
her
in
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
whether
to
say
the
possession
or
the
assumption
of
a
certain
"
rondeur
et
franchise
de
bonne
femme
;
"
which
on
various
occasions
gained
the
point
aimed
at
with
instant
and
complete
success
,
where
severe
gravity
and
serious
reasoning
would
probably
have
failed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ce
pauvre
Docteur
Jean
!
<EOS>
"
she
would
say
,
chuckling
and
rubbing
joyously
her
fat
little
white
hands
;
"
ce
cher
jeune
homme
!
<EOS>
le
meilleur
créature
du
monde
!
"
and
go
on
to
explain
how
she
happened
to
be
employing
him
for
her
own
children
,
who
were
so
fond
of
him
they
would
scream
themselves
into
fits
at
the
thought
of
another
doctor
<EOS>
;
how
,
where
she
had
confidence
for
her
own
,
she
thought
it
natural
to
repose
trust
for
others
,
and
au
reste
,
it
was
only
the
most
temporary
expedient
in
the
world
;
Blanche
and
Angélique
had
the
migraine
;
Dr.
John
had
written
a
prescription
;
voilà
tout
!
  
<EOS>
The
parents
'
mouths
were
closed
.
<EOS>
Blanche
and
Angélique
saved
her
all
remaining
trouble
by
chanting
loud
duets
in
their
physician
's
praise
;
the
other
pupils
echoed
them
,
unanimously
declaring
that
when
they
were
ill
they
would
have
Dr.
John
and
nobody
else
;
and
Madame
laughed
,
and
the
parents
laughed
too
.
<EOS>
The
Labassecouriens
must
have
a
large
organ
of
philoprogenitiveness
:
at
least
the
indulgence
of
offspring
is
carried
by
them
to
excessive
lengths
;
the
law
of
most
households
being
the
children
's
will
.
<EOS>
Madame
now
got
credit
for
having
acted
on
this
occasion
in
a
spirit
of
motherly
partiality
<EOS>
:
she
came
off
with
flying
colours
;
people
liked
her
as
a
directress
better
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
To
this
day
I
never
fully
understood
why
she
thus
risked
her
interest
for
the
sake
of
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
What
people
said
,
of
course
I
know
well
:
<EOS>
the
whole
house
 
pupils
,
teachers
,
servants
included
 
affirmed
that
she
was
going
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
So
they
had
settled
it
;
difference
of
age
seemed
to
make
no
obstacle
in
their
eyes
:
<EOS>
it
was
to
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
admitted
that
appearances
did
not
wholly
discountenance
this
idea
;
Madame
seemed
so
bent
on
retaining
his
services
,
so
oblivious
of
her
former
protégé
,
Pillule
.
<EOS>
She
made
,
too
,
such
a
point
of
personally
receiving
his
visits
,
and
was
so
unfailingly
cheerful
,
blithe
,
and
benignant
in
her
manner
to
him
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
she
paid
,
about
this
time
,
marked
attention
to
dress
:
<EOS>
the
morning
dishabille
,
the
nightcap
and
shawl
,
were
discarded
;
Dr.
John
's
early
visits
always
found
her
with
auburn
braids
all
nicely
arranged
,
silk
dress
trimly
fitted
on
,
neat
laced
brodequins
in
lieu
of
slippers
:
in
short
the
whole
toilette
complete
as
a
model
,
and
fresh
as
a
flower
.
<EOS>
I
scarcely
think
,
however
,
that
her
intention
in
this
went
further
than
just
to
show
a
very
handsome
man
that
she
was
not
quite
a
plain
woman
;
and
plain
she
was
not
.
<EOS>
Without
beauty
of
feature
or
elegance
of
form
,
she
pleased
.
<EOS>
Without
youth
and
its
gay
graces
,
she
cheered
.
<EOS>
One
never
tired
of
seeing
her
:
she
was
never
monotonous
,
or
insipid
,
or
colourless
,
or
flat
.
<EOS>
Her
unfaded
hair
,
her
eye
with
its
temperate
blue
light
,
her
cheek
with
its
wholesome
fruit
-
like
bloom
 
<EOS>
these
things
pleased
in
moderation
,
but
with
constancy
.
  
<EOS>
Had
she
,
indeed
,
floating
visions
of
adopting
Dr.
John
as
a
husband
,
taking
him
to
her
well
-
furnished
home
,
endowing
him
with
her
savings
,
which
were
said
to
amount
to
a
moderate
competency
,
and
making
him
comfortable
for
the
rest
of
his
life
?
<EOS>
Did
Dr.
John
suspect
her
of
such
visions
?
<EOS>
I
have
met
him
coming
out
of
her
presence
with
a
mischievous
half
-
smile
about
his
lips
,
and
in
his
eyes
a
look
as
of
masculine
vanity
elate
and
tickled
.
<EOS>
With
all
his
good
looks
and
good
-
nature
,
he
was
not
perfect
;
he
must
have
been
very
imperfect
if
he
roguishly
encouraged
aims
he
never
intended
to
be
successful
.
<EOS>
But
did
he
not
intend
them
to
be
successful
?
<EOS>
People
said
he
had
no
money
,
that
he
was
wholly
dependent
upon
his
profession
.
<EOS>
Madame
 
<EOS>
though
perhaps
some
fourteen
years
his
senior
 
was
yet
the
sort
of
woman
never
to
grow
old
,
never
to
wither
,
never
to
break
down
.
<EOS>
They
certainly
were
on
good
terms
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
perhaps
was
not
in
love
;
but
how
many
people
ever
_
<EOS>
do
_
love
,
or
at
least
marry
for
love
,
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
We
waited
the
end
.
  
<EOS>
For
what
_
he
_
waited
,
I
do
not
know
,
nor
for
what
he
watched
;
but
the
peculiarity
of
his
manner
,
his
expectant
,
vigilant
,
absorbed
,
eager
look
,
never
wore
off
:
it
rather
intensified
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
been
quite
within
the
compass
of
my
penetration
,
and
I
think
he
ranged
farther
and
farther
beyond
it
.
  
<EOS>
One
morning
little
Georgette
had
been
more
feverish
and
consequently
more
peevish
;
she
was
crying
,
and
would
not
be
pacified
.
<EOS>
I
thought
a
particular
draught
ordered
,
disagreed
with
her
,
and
I
doubted
whether
it
ought
to
be
continued
;
I
waited
impatiently
for
the
doctor
's
coming
in
order
to
consult
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
door
-
bell
rang
,
he
was
admitted
;
I
felt
sure
of
this
,
for
I
heard
his
voice
addressing
the
portress
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
custom
to
mount
straight
to
the
nursery
,
taking
about
three
degrees
of
the
staircase
at
once
,
and
coming
upon
us
like
a
cheerful
surprise
.
<EOS>
Five
minutes
elapsed
 
ten
 
<EOS>
and
I
saw
and
heard
nothing
of
him
.
<EOS>
What
could
he
be
doing
?
<EOS>
Possibly
waiting
in
the
corridor
below
.
<EOS>
Little
Georgette
still
piped
her
plaintive
wail
,
appealing
to
me
by
her
familiar
term
,
"
Minnie
,
Minnie
,
me
very
poorly
!
"
<EOS>
till
my
heart
ached
.
<EOS>
I
descended
to
ascertain
why
he
did
not
come
.
<EOS>
The
corridor
was
empty
.
<EOS>
Whither
was
he
vanished
?
<EOS>
Was
he
with
Madame
in
the
_
salle
-
à
-
manger
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Impossible
:
I
had
left
her
but
a
short
time
since
,
dressing
in
her
own
chamber
.
<EOS>
I
listened
.
<EOS>
Three
pupils
were
just
then
hard
at
work
practising
in
three
proximate
rooms
 
the
dining
-
room
and
the
greater
and
lesser
drawing
-
rooms
,
between
which
and
the
corridor
there
was
but
the
portress
's
cabinet
communicating
with
the
salons
,
and
intended
originally
for
a
boudoir
.
<EOS>
Farther
off
,
at
a
fourth
instrument
in
the
oratory
,
a
whole
class
of
a
dozen
or
more
were
taking
a
singing
lesson
,
and
just
then
joining
in
a
"
barcarole
"
(
I
think
they
called
it
)
<EOS>
,
whereof
I
yet
remember
these
words
"
fraîchë
,
"
"
brisë
,
"
and
"
Venisë
.
"
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
what
could
I
hear
?
<EOS>
A
great
deal
,
certainly
;
had
it
only
been
to
the
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
<EOS>
;
I
heard
a
giddy
treble
laugh
in
the
above
-
mentioned
little
cabinet
,
close
by
the
door
of
which
I
stood
 
that
door
half
-
unclosed
;
a
man
's
voice
in
a
soft
,
deep
,
pleading
tone
,
uttered
some
,
words
,
whereof
I
only
caught
the
adjuration
,
"
<EOS>
For
God
's
sake
!
"
<EOS>
Then
,
after
a
second
's
pause
,
forth
issued
Dr.
John
,
his
eye
full
shining
,
but
not
with
either
joy
or
triumph
;
his
fair
English
cheek
high
-
coloured
;
a
baffled
,
tortured
,
anxious
,
and
yet
a
tender
meaning
on
his
brow
.
  
<EOS>
The
open
door
served
me
as
a
screen
;
but
had
I
been
full
in
his
way
<EOS>
,
I
believe
he
would
have
passed
without
seeing
me
.
<EOS>
Some
mortification
,
some
strong
vexation
had
hold
of
his
soul
:
or
rather
,
to
write
my
impressions
now
as
I
received
them
at
the
time
I
should
say
some
sorrow
,
some
sense
of
injustice
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
so
much
think
his
pride
was
hurt
,
as
that
his
affections
had
been
wounded
 
cruelly
wounded
,
it
seemed
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
who
was
the
torturer
?
<EOS>
What
being
in
that
house
had
him
so
much
in
her
power
?
<EOS>
Madame
I
believed
to
be
in
her
chamber
;
the
room
whence
he
had
stepped
was
dedicated
to
the
portress
's
sole
use
;
and
she
,
Rosine
Matou
,
an
unprincipled
though
pretty
little
French
grisette
,
airy
,
fickle
,
dressy
,
vain
,
and
mercenary
 
<EOS>
it
was
not
,
surely
,
to
_
<EOS>
her
_
hand
he
owed
the
ordeal
through
which
he
seemed
to
have
passed
?
  
<EOS>
But
while
I
pondered
,
her
voice
,
clear
,
though
somewhat
sharp
,
broke
out
in
a
lightsome
French
song
,
trilling
through
the
door
<EOS>
still
ajar
:
I
glanced
in
,
doubting
my
senses
.
<EOS>
There
at
the
table
she
sat
in
a
smart
dress
of
"
jaconas
rose
,
"
trimming
a
tiny
blond
cap
:
not
a
living
thing
save
herself
was
in
the
room
,
except
indeed
some
gold
fish
in
a
glass
globe
,
some
flowers
in
pots
,
and
a
broad
July
sunbeam
.
  
<EOS>
Here
was
a
problem
:
but
I
must
go
up
-
stairs
to
ask
about
the
medicine
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
John
sat
in
a
chair
at
Georgette
's
bedside
;
Madame
stood
before
him
;
the
little
patient
had
been
examined
and
soothed
,
and
now
lay
composed
in
her
crib
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
,
as
I
entered
,
was
discussing
the
physician
's
own
health
,
remarking
on
some
real
or
fancied
change
in
his
looks
,
charging
him
with
over
-
work
,
and
recommending
rest
and
change
of
air
.
<EOS>
He
listened
good
-
naturedly
,
but
with
laughing
indifference
,
telling
her
that
she
was
"
trop
bonne
,
"
and
that
he
felt
perfectly
well
.
<EOS>
Madame
appealed
to
me
 
Dr.
John
following
her
movement
with
a
slow
glance
which
seemed
to
express
languid
surprise
at
reference
being
made
to
a
quarter
so
insignificant
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
,
Miss
Lucie
?
"
asked
Madame
.
<EOS>
"
Is
he
not
paler
and
thinner
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
very
seldom
that
I
uttered
more
than
monosyllables
in
Dr.
John
's
presence
;
he
was
the
kind
of
person
with
whom
I
was
likely
ever
to
remain
the
neutral
,
passive
thing
he
thought
me
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
I
took
licence
to
answer
in
a
phrase
:
and
a
phrase
I
purposely
made
quite
significant
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
looks
ill
at
this
moment
;
but
perhaps
it
is
owing
to
some
temporary
cause
:
Dr.
John
may
have
been
vexed
or
harassed
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
how
he
took
this
speech
,
as
I
never
sought
his
face
for
information
.
<EOS>
Georgette
here
began
to
ask
me
in
her
broken
English
if
she
might
have
a
glass
of
_
eau
<EOS>
sucrée
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
I
answered
her
in
English
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
,
I
fancy
,
he
noticed
that
I
spoke
his
language
;
hitherto
he
had
always
taken
me
for
a
foreigner
,
addressing
me
as
"
Mademoiselle
,
"
and
giving
in
French
the
requisite
directions
about
the
children
's
treatment
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
on
the
point
of
making
a
remark
;
but
thinking
better
of
it
,
held
his
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
recommenced
advising
him
;
he
shook
his
head
,
laughing
,
rose
and
bid
her
good
-
morning
,
with
courtesy
,
but
still
with
the
regardless
air
of
one
whom
too
much
unsolicited
attention
was
surfeiting
and
spoiling
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
was
gone
,
Madame
dropped
into
the
chair
he
had
just
left
;
she
rested
her
chin
in
her
hand
;
all
that
was
animated
and
amiable
vanished
from
her
face
:
she
looked
stony
and
stern
,
almost
mortified
and
morose
.
<EOS>
She
sighed
;
a
single
,
but
a
deep
sigh
.
<EOS>
A
loud
bell
rang
for
morning
-
school
.
<EOS>
She
got
up
;
as
she
passed
a
dressing
-
table
with
a
glass
upon
it
,
she
looked
at
her
reflected
image
.
<EOS>
One
single
white
hair
streaked
her
nut
-
brown
tresses
;
she
plucked
it
out
with
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
In
the
full
summer
daylight
,
her
face
,
though
it
still
had
the
colour
,
could
plainly
be
seen
to
have
lost
the
texture
of
youth
;
and
then
,
where
were
youth
's
contours
?
<EOS>
Ah
,
Madame
!
<EOS>
wise
as
you
were
,
even
_
<EOS>
you
_
knew
weakness
.
<EOS>
Never
had
I
pitied
Madame
before
,
but
my
heart
softened
towards
her
,
when
she
turned
darkly
from
the
glass
.
<EOS>
A
calamity
had
come
upon
her
.
<EOS>
That
hag
Disappointment
was
greeting
her
with
a
grisly
"
All
-
hail
,
"
and
her
soul
rejected
the
intimacy
.
  
<EOS>
But
Rosine
!
<EOS>
My
bewilderment
there
surpasses
description
.
<EOS>
I
embraced
five
opportunities
of
passing
her
cabinet
that
day
,
with
a
view
to
contemplating
her
charms
,
and
finding
out
the
secret
of
their
influence
.
<EOS>
She
was
pretty
,
young
,
and
wore
a
well
-
made
dress
.
<EOS>
All
very
good
points
,
and
,
I
suppose
,
amply
sufficient
to
account
,
in
any
philosophic
mind
,
for
any
amount
of
agony
and
distraction
in
a
young
man
,
like
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
Still
,
I
could
not
help
forming
half
a
wish
that
the
said
doctor
were
my
brother
;
or
at
least
that
he
had
a
sister
or
a
mother
who
would
kindly
sermonize
him
.
<EOS>
I
say
_
half
_
<EOS>
a
wish
<EOS>
;
I
broke
it
,
and
flung
it
away
before
it
became
a
whole
one
,
discovering
in
good
time
its
exquisite
folly
.
<EOS>
"
Somebody
,
"
I
argued
,
"
might
as
well
sermonize
Madame
about
her
young
physician
:
and
what
good
would
that
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
believe
Madame
sermonized
herself
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
behave
weakly
,
or
make
herself
in
any
shape
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
she
had
neither
strong
feelings
to
overcome
,
nor
tender
feelings
by
which
to
be
miserably
pained
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
likewise
that
she
had
an
important
avocation
,
a
real
business
to
fill
her
time
,
divert
her
thoughts
,
and
divide
her
interest
.
<EOS>
It
is
especially
true
that
she
possessed
a
genuine
good
sense
which
is
not
given
to
all
women
nor
to
all
men
;
and
by
dint
of
these
combined
advantages
she
behaved
wisely
 
she
behaved
well
.
<EOS>
Brava
!
<EOS>
once
more
,
Madame
Beck
.
<EOS>
I
saw
you
matched
against
an
Apollyon
of
a
predilection
;
you
fought
a
good
fight
,
and
you
overcame
!
    
<EOS>
THE
CASKET
.
  
<EOS>
Behind
the
house
at
the
Rue
Fossette
there
was
a
garden
 
large
,
considering
that
it
lay
in
the
heart
of
a
city
,
and
to
my
recollection
at
this
day
it
seems
pleasant
:
but
time
,
like
distance
,
lends
to
certain
scenes
an
influence
so
softening
;
and
where
all
is
stone
around
,
blank
wall
and
hot
pavement
<EOS>
,
how
precious
seems
one
shrub
,
how
lovely
an
enclosed
and
planted
spot

<EOS>
There
went
a
tradition
that
Madame
Beck
's
house
had
in
old
days
<EOS>
been
a
convent
.
<EOS>
That
in
years
gone
by
 
<EOS>
how
long
gone
by
I
can
not
tell
,
but
I
think
some
centuries
 
before
the
city
had
over
-
spread
this
quarter
,
and
when
it
was
tilled
ground
and
avenue
,
and
such
deep
and
leafy
seclusion
as
ought
to
embosom
a
religious
house
-
that
something
had
happened
on
this
site
which
,
rousing
fear
and
inflicting
horror
,
had
left
to
the
place
the
inheritance
of
a
ghost
-
story
.
<EOS>
A
vague
tale
went
of
a
black
and
white
nun
,
sometimes
,
on
some
night
or
nights
of
the
year
,
seen
in
some
part
of
this
vicinage
.
<EOS>
The
ghost
must
have
been
built
out
some
ages
ago
,
for
there
were
houses
all
round
now
;
but
certain
convent
-
relics
,
in
the
shape
of
old
and
huge
fruit
-
trees
,
yet
consecrated
the
spot
;
and
,
at
the
foot
of
one
 
a
Methuselah
of
a
pear
-
tree
,
<EOS>
dead
,
all
but
a
few
boughs
which
still
faithfully
renewed
their
perfumed
snow
in
spring
,
and
their
honey
-
sweet
pendants
in
autumn
 
<EOS>
you
saw
,
in
scraping
away
the
mossy
earth
between
the
half
-
bared
roots
,
a
glimpse
of
slab
,
smooth
,
hard
,
and
black
.
<EOS>
The
legend
went
,
unconfirmed
and
unaccredited
,
but
still
propagated
,
that
this
was
the
portal
of
a
vault
,
imprisoning
deep
beneath
that
ground
,
on
whose
surface
grass
grew
and
flowers
bloomed
,
the
bones
of
a
girl
whom
a
monkish
conclave
of
the
drear
middle
ages
had
here
buried
alive
for
some
sin
against
her
vow
.
<EOS>
Her
shadow
<EOS>
it
was
that
tremblers
had
feared
,
through
long
generations
after
her
poor
frame
was
dust
;
her
black
robe
and
white
veil
that
,
for
timid
eyes
,
moonlight
and
shade
had
mocked
,
as
they
fluctuated
in
the
night
-
wind
through
the
garden
-
thicket
.
  
<EOS>
Independently
of
romantic
rubbish
,
however
,
that
old
garden
had
its
charms
.
<EOS>
On
summer
mornings
I
used
to
rise
early
,
to
enjoy
them
alone
;
on
summer
evenings
,
to
linger
solitary
,
to
keep
tryste
with
the
rising
moon
,
or
taste
one
kiss
of
the
evening
breeze
,
or
fancy
rather
than
feel
the
freshness
of
dew
descending
.
<EOS>
The
turf
was
verdant
,
the
gravelled
walks
were
white
;
sun
-
bright
nasturtiums
clustered
beautiful
about
the
roots
of
the
doddered
orchard
giants
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
large
berceau
,
above
which
spread
the
shade
of
an
acacia
;
there
was
a
smaller
,
more
sequestered
bower
,
nestled
in
the
vines
which
ran
all
along
a
high
and
grey
wall
,
and
gathered
their
tendrils
in
a
knot
of
beauty
,
and
hung
their
clusters
in
loving
profusion
about
the
favoured
spot
where
jasmine
and
ivy
met
and
married
them
.
  
<EOS>
Doubtless
at
high
noon
,
in
the
broad
,
vulgar
middle
of
the
day
,
when
Madame
Beck
's
large
school
turned
out
rampant
,
and
externes
and
pensionnaires
were
spread
abroad
,
vying
with
the
denizens
of
the
boys
'
college
close
at
hand
,
in
the
brazen
exercise
of
their
lungs
and
limbs
 
<EOS>
doubtless
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
then
_
<EOS>
the
garden
was
a
trite
,
trodden
-
down
place
enough
.
<EOS>
But
at
sunset
or
the
hour
of
_
salut
_
,
when
the
externes
were
gone
home
,
and
the
boarders
quiet
at
their
studies
;
pleasant
was
it
then
to
stray
down
the
peaceful
alleys
,
and
hear
the
bells
of
St.
Jean
Baptiste
peal
out
with
their
sweet
,
soft
,
exalted
sound
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
walking
thus
one
evening
,
and
had
been
detained
farther
within
the
verge
of
twilight
than
usual
,
by
the
still
-
deepening
calm
,
the
mellow
coolness
,
the
fragrant
breathing
with
which
flowers
no
sunshine
could
win
now
answered
the
persuasion
of
the
dew
.
<EOS>
I
saw
by
a
light
in
the
oratory
window
that
the
Catholic
household
were
then
gathered
to
evening
prayer
 
<EOS>
a
rite
,
from
attendance
on
which
,
I
now
and
then
,
as
a
Protestant
,
exempted
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
moment
longer
,
"
whispered
solitude
and
the
summer
moon
,
"
stay
with
us
:
all
is
truly
quiet
now
;
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
your
presence
will
not
be
missed
:
the
day
's
heat
and
bustle
have
tired
you
;
enjoy
these
precious
minutes
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
windowless
backs
of
houses
built
in
this
garden
,
and
in
particular
the
whole
of
one
side
,
was
skirted
by
the
rear
of
a
long
line
of
premises
 
being
the
boarding
-
houses
of
the
neighbouring
college
.
<EOS>
This
rear
,
however
,
was
all
blank
stone
,
with
the
exception
of
certain
attic
loopholes
high
up
,
opening
from
the
sleeping
-
rooms
of
the
women
-
servants
,
and
also
one
casement
in
a
lower
story
<EOS>
said
to
mark
the
chamber
or
study
of
a
master
.
<EOS>
But
,
though
thus
secure
,
an
alley
,
which
ran
parallel
with
the
very
high
wall
on
that
side
the
garden
,
was
forbidden
to
be
entered
by
the
pupils
.
<EOS>
It
was
called
indeed
"
l'allée
défendue
,
"
and
any
girl
setting
foot
there
would
have
rendered
herself
liable
to
as
severe
a
penalty
as
the
mild
rules
of
Madame
Beck
's
establishment
permitted
.
<EOS>
Teachers
might
indeed
go
there
with
impunity
;
but
as
the
walk
was
narrow
,
and
the
neglected
shrubs
were
grown
very
thick
and
close
on
each
side
,
weaving
overhead
a
roof
of
branch
and
leaf
which
the
sun
's
rays
penetrated
but
in
rare
chequers
,
this
alley
was
seldom
entered
even
during
day
,
and
after
dusk
was
carefully
shunned
.
  
<EOS>
From
the
first
I
was
tempted
to
make
an
exception
to
this
rule
of
avoidance
:
the
seclusion
,
the
very
gloom
of
the
walk
attracted
me
.
<EOS>
For
a
long
time
the
fear
of
seeming
singular
scared
me
away
;
but
by
degrees
,
as
people
became
accustomed
to
me
and
my
habits
,
and
to
such
shades
of
peculiarity
as
were
engrained
in
my
nature
 
shades
,
certainly
not
striking
enough
to
interest
,
and
perhaps
not
prominent
enough
to
offend
,
but
born
in
and
with
me
,
and
no
more
to
be
parted
with
than
my
identity
 
by
slow
degrees
<EOS>
I
became
a
frequenter
of
this
strait
and
narrow
path
.
<EOS>
I
made
myself
gardener
of
some
tintless
flowers
that
grew
between
its
closely
-
ranked
shrubs
;
I
cleared
away
the
relics
of
past
autumns
,
choking
up
a
rustic
seat
at
the
far
end
.
<EOS>
Borrowing
of
Goton
,
the
cuisinière
,
a
pail
of
water
and
a
scrubbing
-
brush
,
I
made
this
seat
clean
.
<EOS>
Madame
saw
me
at
work
and
smiled
approbation
:
whether
sincerely
or
not
I
do
n't
know
;
but
she
_
seemed
_
sincere
.
  
<EOS>
"
Voyez
-
vous
,
"
cried
she
,
"
comme
elle
est
propre
,
cette
demoiselle
Lucie
?
<EOS>
Vous
aimez
done
cette
allée
,
Meess
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
,
"
it
is
quiet
and
shady
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
C'est
juste
,
"
cried
she
with
an
air
of
bonté
;
and
she
kindly
recommended
me
to
confine
myself
to
it
as
much
as
I
chose
,
saying
,
that
as
I
was
not
charged
with
the
surveillance
,
I
need
not
trouble
myself
to
walk
with
the
pupils
:
only
I
might
permit
her
children
to
come
there
,
to
talk
English
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
night
in
question
,
I
was
sitting
on
the
hidden
seat
reclaimed
from
fungi
and
mould
,
listening
to
what
seemed
the
far
-
off
sounds
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
Far
off
,
in
truth
,
they
were
not
:
this
school
was
in
the
city
's
centre
;
hence
,
it
was
but
five
minutes
'
walk
to
the
park
,
scarce
ten
to
buildings
of
palatial
splendour
.
<EOS>
Quite
near
were
wide
streets
brightly
lit
,
teeming
at
this
moment
with
life
:
carriages
were
rolling
through
them
to
balls
or
to
the
opera
.
<EOS>
The
same
hour
which
tolled
curfew
for
our
convent
,
which
extinguished
each
lamp
,
and
dropped
the
curtain
round
each
couch
,
rang
for
the
gay
city
about
us
the
summons
to
festal
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
Of
this
contrast
I
thought
not
,
however
:
gay
instincts
my
nature
had
few
;
ball
or
opera
I
had
never
seen
;
and
though
often
I
had
heard
them
described
,
and
even
wished
to
see
them
,
it
was
not
the
wish
of
one
who
hopes
to
partake
a
pleasure
if
she
could
only
reach
it
 
who
feels
fitted
to
shine
in
some
bright
distant
sphere
<EOS>
,
could
she
but
thither
win
her
way
;
it
was
no
yearning
to
attain
,
no
hunger
to
taste
;
only
the
calm
desire
to
look
on
a
new
thing
.
  
<EOS>
A
moon
was
in
the
sky
,
not
a
full
moon
,
but
a
young
crescent
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
through
a
space
in
the
boughs
overhead
.
<EOS>
She
and
the
stars
,
visible
beside
her
,
were
no
strangers
where
all
else
was
strange
:
my
childhood
knew
them
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
that
golden
sign
with
the
dark
globe
in
its
curve
leaning
back
on
azure
,
beside
an
old
thorn
at
the
top
of
an
old
field
,
in
Old
England
,
in
long
past
days
,
just
as
it
now
leaned
back
beside
a
stately
spire
in
this
continental
capital
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
childhood
!
<EOS>
I
had
feelings
:
passive
as
I
lived
,
little
as
I
spoke
,
cold
as
I
looked
,
when
I
thought
of
past
days
,
I
_
could
_
feel
.
<EOS>
About
the
present
,
it
was
better
to
be
stoical
;
about
the
future
 
such
a
future
as
mine
 
to
be
dead
.
<EOS>
And
in
catalepsy
and
a
dead
trance
,
I
studiously
held
the
quick
of
my
nature
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
time
,
I
well
remember
whatever
could
excite
 
certain
accidents
of
the
weather
,
for
instance
,
were
almost
dreaded
by
me
,
because
they
woke
the
being
I
was
always
lulling
,
and
stirred
up
a
craving
cry
I
could
not
satisfy
.
<EOS>
One
night
a
thunder
-
storm
broke
;
a
sort
of
hurricane
shook
us
in
our
beds
:
the
Catholics
rose
in
panic
and
prayed
to
their
saints
.
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
the
tempest
took
hold
of
me
with
tyranny
:
I
was
roughly
roused
and
obliged
to
live
.
<EOS>
I
got
up
and
dressed
myself
,
and
creeping
outside
the
casement
close
by
my
bed
,
sat
on
its
ledge
,
with
my
feet
on
the
roof
of
a
lower
adjoining
building
.
<EOS>
It
was
wet
,
it
was
wild
,
it
was
pitch
-
dark
.
<EOS>
Within
the
dormitory
they
gathered
round
the
night
-
lamp
in
consternation
,
praying
loud
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
go
in
:
too
resistless
was
the
delight
of
staying
with
the
wild
hour
,
black
and
full
of
thunder
,
pealing
out
such
an
ode
as
language
never
delivered
to
man
 
too
terribly
glorious
,
the
spectacle
of
clouds
,
split
and
pierced
by
white
and
blinding
bolts
.
  
<EOS>
I
did
long
,
achingly
,
then
and
for
four
and
twenty
hours
afterwards
,
for
something
to
fetch
me
out
of
my
present
existence
,
and
lead
me
upwards
and
onwards
.
<EOS>
This
longing
,
and
all
of
a
similar
kind
,
it
was
necessary
to
knock
on
the
head
;
which
I
did
,
figuratively
,
after
the
manner
of
Jael
to
Sisera
,
driving
a
nail
through
their
temples
.
<EOS>
Unlike
Sisera
,
they
did
not
die
:
they
were
but
transiently
stunned
,
and
at
intervals
would
turn
on
the
nail
with
a
rebellious
wrench
:
then
did
the
temples
bleed
,
and
the
brain
thrill
to
its
core
.
  
<EOS>
To
-
night
,
I
was
not
so
mutinous
,
nor
so
miserable
.
<EOS>
My
Sisera
lay
quiet
in
the
tent
,
slumbering
;
and
if
his
pain
ached
through
his
slumbers
,
something
like
an
angel
 
<EOS>
the
ideal
 
knelt
near
,
dropping
balm
on
the
soothed
temples
,
holding
before
the
sealed
eyes
a
magic
glass
,
of
which
the
sweet
,
solemn
visions
were
repeated
in
dreams
,
and
shedding
a
reflex
from
her
moonlight
wings
and
robe
over
the
transfixed
sleeper
,
over
the
tent
threshold
,
over
all
the
landscape
lying
without
.
<EOS>
Jael
,
the
stern
woman
;
sat
apart
,
relenting
somewhat
over
her
captive
;
but
more
prone
to
dwell
on
the
faithful
expectation
of
Heber
coming
home
.
<EOS>
By
which
words
<EOS>
I
mean
that
the
cool
peace
and
dewy
sweetness
of
the
night
filled
me
with
a
mood
of
hope
:
not
hope
on
any
definite
point
,
but
a
general
sense
of
encouragement
and
heart
-
ease
.
  
<EOS>
Should
not
such
a
mood
,
so
sweet
,
so
tranquil
,
so
unwonted
,
have
been
the
harbinger
of
good
?
<EOS>
Alas
,
no
good
came
of
it
!
<EOS>
I
Presently
the
rude
Real
burst
coarsely
in
 
all
evil
grovelling
and
repellent
as
she
too
often
is
.
  
<EOS>
Amid
the
intense
stillness
of
that
pile
of
stone
overlooking
the
walk
,
the
trees
,
the
high
wall
,
I
heard
a
sound
;
a
casement
[
all
the
windows
here
are
casements
,
opening
on
hinges
]
creaked
.
<EOS>
Ere
I
had
time
to
look
up
and
mark
where
,
in
which
story
,
or
by
whom
unclosed
,
a
tree
overhead
shook
,
as
if
struck
by
a
missile
;
some
object
dropped
prone
at
my
feet
.
  
<EOS>
Nine
was
striking
by
St.
Jean
Baptiste
's
clock
;
day
was
fading
,
but
it
was
not
dark
:
the
crescent
moon
aided
little
,
but
the
deep
gilding
of
that
point
in
heaven
where
the
sun
beamed
last
,
and
the
crystalline
clearness
of
a
wide
space
above
,
sustained
the
summer
twilight
;
even
in
my
dark
walk
I
could
,
by
approaching
an
opening
,
have
managed
to
read
print
of
a
small
type
.
<EOS>
Easy
was
it
to
see
then
that
the
missile
was
a
box
,
a
small
box
of
white
and
coloured
ivory
;
its
loose
lid
opened
in
my
hand
;
violets
lay
within
,
violets
smothering
a
closely
folded
bit
of
pink
paper
,
a
note
,
superscribed
,
"
Pour
la
robe
grise
.
<EOS>
"
I
wore
indeed
a
dress
of
French
grey
.
  
<EOS>
Good
.
<EOS>
Was
this
a
billet
-
doux
?
<EOS>
A
thing
I
had
heard
of
,
but
hitherto
had
not
had
the
honour
of
seeing
or
handling
.
<EOS>
Was
it
this
sort
of
commodity
I
held
between
my
finger
and
thumb
at
this
moment
?
  
<EOS>
Scarcely
:
I
did
not
dream
it
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Suitor
or
admirer
my
very
thoughts
had
not
conceived
.
<EOS>
All
the
teachers
had
dreams
of
some
lover
;
one
<EOS>
(
but
she
was
naturally
of
a
credulous
turn
)
believed
in
a
future
husband
.
<EOS>
All
the
pupils
above
fourteen
knew
of
some
prospective
bridegroom
;
two
or
three
were
already
affianced
by
their
parents
,
and
had
been
so
from
childhood
:
<EOS>
but
into
the
realm
of
feelings
and
hopes
which
such
prospects
open
,
my
speculations
,
far
less
my
presumptions
,
had
never
once
had
warrant
to
intrude
.
<EOS>
If
the
other
teachers
went
into
town
,
or
took
a
walk
on
the
boulevards
,
or
only
attended
mass
,
they
were
very
certain
(
according
to
the
accounts
brought
back
)
to
meet
with
some
individual
of
the
"
opposite
sex
,
"
whose
rapt
,
earnest
gaze
assured
them
of
their
power
to
strike
and
to
attract
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
that
my
experience
tallied
with
theirs
,
in
this
respect
.
<EOS>
I
went
to
church
<EOS>
and
I
took
walks
,
and
am
very
well
convinced
that
nobody
minded
me
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
girl
or
woman
in
the
Rue
Fossette
who
could
not
,
and
did
not
testify
to
having
received
an
admiring
beam
from
our
young
doctor
's
blue
eyes
at
one
time
or
other
.
<EOS>
I
am
obliged
,
however
humbling
it
may
sound
,
to
except
myself
:
as
far
as
I
was
concerned
,
those
blue
eyes
were
guiltless
,
and
calm
as
the
sky
,
to
whose
tint
theirs
seemed
akin
.
<EOS>
So
it
came
to
pass
that
I
heard
the
others
talk
,
wondered
often
at
their
gaiety
,
security
,
and
self
-
satisfaction
,
but
did
not
trouble
myself
to
look
up
and
gaze
along
the
path
<EOS>
they
seemed
so
certain
of
treading
.
<EOS>
This
then
was
no
billet
-
doux
;
and
it
was
in
settled
conviction
to
the
contrary
that
I
quietly
opened
it
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
ran
 
<EOS>
I
translate
:
    
<EOS>
"
Angel
of
my
dreams
!
<EOS>
A
thousand
,
thousand
thanks
for
the
promise
kept
:
scarcely
did
I
venture
to
hope
its
fulfilment
.
<EOS>
I
believed
you
,
indeed
,
to
be
half
in
jest
;
and
then
you
seemed
to
think
the
enterprise
beset
with
such
danger
 
the
hour
so
untimely
,
the
alley
so
strictly
secluded
 
often
,
you
said
,
haunted
by
that
dragon
,
the
English
teacher
 
une
véritable
bégueule

Britannique
à
ce
que

brusque
et
<EOS>

et

<EOS>
(
the
reader
will
excuse
my
modesty
in
allowing
this
flattering
sketch
of
my
amiable
self
to
retain
the
slight
veil
of
the
original
tongue
)
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
aware
,
"
went
on
this
precious
effusion
,
"
that
little
Gustave
,
on
account
of
his
illness
,
has
been
removed
to
a
master
's
chamber
 
that
favoured
chamber
,
whose
lattice
overlooks
your
prison
-
ground
.
<EOS>
There
,
I
,
the
best
uncle
in
the
world
,
am
admitted
to
visit
him
.
<EOS>
How
tremblingly
I
approached
the
window
and
glanced
into
your
Eden
 
an
Eden
for
me
,
though
a
desert
for
you
!
 
<EOS>
how
I
feared
to
behold
vacancy
,
or
the
dragon
aforesaid
!
<EOS>
How
my
heart
palpitated
with
delight
when
,
through
apertures
in
the
envious
boughs
,
I
at
once
caught
the
gleam
of
your
graceful
straw
-
hat
,
and
the
waving
of
your
grey
dress
 
dress
that
I
should
recognise
amongst
a
thousand
.
<EOS>
But
why
,
my
angel
,
will
you
not
look
up
?
<EOS>
Cruel
,
to
deny
me
one
ray
of
those
adorable
eyes
!
 
<EOS>
how
a
single
glance
would
have
revived
me
!
<EOS>
I
write
this
in
fiery
haste
;
while
the
physician
examines
Gustave
,
I
snatch
an
opportunity
to
enclose
it
in
a
small
casket
,
together
with
a
bouquet
of
flowers
,
the
sweetest
that
blow
 
yet
less
sweet
than
thee
,
my
Peri
 
my
all
-
charming
!
<EOS>
ever
thine
-
thou
<EOS>
well
knowest
whom
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
did
know
whom
,
"
was
my
comment
;
and
the
wish
bore
even
closer
reference
to
the
person
addressed
in
this
choice
document
,
than
to
the
writer
thereof
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
from
the
fiancé
of
one
of
the
engaged
pupils
;
and
,
in
that
case
,
there
was
no
great
harm
done
or
intended
 
only
a
small
irregularity
.
<EOS>
Several
of
the
girls
,
the
majority
,
indeed
,
had
brothers
or
cousins
at
the
neighbouring
college
.
<EOS>
But
"
la
robe
grise
,
le
chapeau
de
paille
,
"
here
surely
was
a
clue
 
a
very
confusing
one
.
<EOS>
The
straw
-
hat
was
an
ordinary
garden
head
-
screen
,
common
to
a
score
besides
myself
.
<EOS>
The
grey
dress
hardly
gave
more
definite
indication
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
herself
ordinarily
wore
a
grey
dress
just
now
;
another
teacher
,
and
three
of
the
pensionnaires
,
had
had
grey
dresses
purchased
of
the
same
shade
and
fabric
as
mine
:
it
was
a
sort
of
every
-
day
wear
which
happened
at
that
time
to
be
in
vogue
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
as
I
pondered
,
I
knew
I
must
go
in
.
<EOS>
Lights
,
moving
in
the
dormitory
,
announced
that
prayers
were
over
,
and
the
pupils
going
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Another
half
-
hour
and
all
doors
would
be
locked
 
all
lights
extinguished
.
<EOS>
The
front
door
yet
stood
open
,
to
admit
into
the
heated
house
the
coolness
of
the
summer
night
;
from
the
portress
's
cabinet
close
by
shone
a
lamp
,
showing
the
long
vestibule
with
the
two
-
leaved
drawing
-
room
doors
on
one
side
,
the
great
street
-
door
closing
the
vista
.
  
<EOS>
All
at
once
,
quick
rang
the
bell
 
quick
,
but
not
loud
 
a
cautious
tinkle
 
a
sort
of
warning
metal
whisper
.
<EOS>
Rosine
darted
from
her
cabinet
and
ran
to
open
.
<EOS>
The
person
she
admitted
stood
with
her
two
minutes
in
parley
:
there
seemed
a
demur
,
a
delay
.
<EOS>
Rosine
came
to
the
garden
door
,
lamp
in
hand
;
she
stood
on
the
steps
,
lifting
her
lamp
,
looking
round
vaguely
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quel
conte
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
with
a
coquettish
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
Personne
n'y
a
été
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
pass
,
"
pleaded
a
voice
I
knew
:
"
I
ask
but
five
minutes
;
"
and
a
familiar
shape
,
tall
and
grand
(
as
we
of
the
Rue
Fossette
all
thought
it
)
,
issued
from
the
house
,
and
strode
down
amongst
the
beds
and
walks
.
<EOS>
It
was
sacrilege
 
the
intrusion
of
a
man
into
that
spot
,
at
that
hour
;
but
he
knew
himself
privileged
,
and
perhaps
he
trusted
to
the
friendly
night
.
<EOS>
He
wandered
down
the
alleys
,
looking
on
this
side
and
<EOS>
on
that
 
he
was
lost
in
the
shrubs
,
trampling
flowers
and
breaking
branches
in
his
search
 
<EOS>
he
penetrated
at
last
the
"
forbidden
walk
.
<EOS>
"
There
I
met
him
,
like
some
ghost
,
I
suppose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dr.
John
!
<EOS>
it
is
found
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
ask
by
whom
,
for
with
his
quick
eye
he
perceived
that
I
held
it
in
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
betray
her
,
"
he
said
,
looking
at
me
as
if
I
were
indeed
a
dragon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Were
I
ever
so
disposed
to
treachery
,
I
can
not
betray
what
I
do
not
know
,
"
was
my
answer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Read
the
note
,
and
you
will
see
how
little
it
reveals
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
have
read
it
,
"
I
thought
to
myself
;
and
yet
I
could
not
believe
he
wrote
it
:
that
could
hardly
be
his
style
<EOS>
:
besides
,
I
was
fool
enough
to
think
there
would
be
a
degree
of
hardship
in
his
calling
me
such
names
.
<EOS>
His
own
look
vindicated
him
;
he
grew
hot
,
and
coloured
as
he
read
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
indeed
too
much
:
<EOS>
this
is
cruel
,
this
is
humiliating
,
"
were
the
words
that
fell
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
thought
it
_
was
_
cruel
,
when
I
saw
his
countenance
so
moved
.
<EOS>
No
matter
whether
he
was
to
blame
or
not
<EOS>
;
somebody
,
it
seemed
to
me
,
must
be
more
to
blame
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
shall
you
do
about
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
of
me
.
"
<EOS>
Shall
you
tell
Madame
Beck
what
you
have
found
,
and
cause
a
stir
 
an
esclandre
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
I
ought
to
tell
,
and
said
so
;
adding
that
I
did
not
believe
there
would
be
either
stir
or
esclandre
:
Madame
was
much
too
prudent
to
make
a
noise
about
an
affair
of
that
sort
connected
with
her
establishment
.
  
<EOS>
He
stood
looking
down
and
meditating
.
<EOS>
He
was
both
too
proud
and
too
honourable
to
entreat
my
secresy
on
a
point
which
duty
evidently
commanded
me
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
I
wished
to
do
right
,
yet
loathed
to
grieve
or
injure
him
.
<EOS>
Just
then
Rosine
glanced
out
through
the
open
door
;
she
could
not
see
us
,
though
between
the
trees
<EOS>
I
could
plainly
see
her
:
<EOS>
her
dress
was
grey
,
like
mine
.
<EOS>
This
circumstance
,
taken
in
connection
with
prior
transactions
,
suggested
to
me
that
perhaps
the
case
,
however
deplorable
,
was
one
in
which
I
was
under
no
obligation
whatever
to
concern
myself
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
I
said
,
 
"
If
you
can
assure
me
that
none
of
Madame
Beck
's
pupils
are
implicated
in
this
business
,
I
shall
be
very
happy
to
stand
aloof
from
all
interference
.
<EOS>
Take
the
casket
,
the
bouquet
,
and
the
billet
;
for
my
part
,
I
gladly
forget
the
whole
affair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
there
!
"
<EOS>
he
whispered
suddenly
,
as
his
hand
closed
on
what
I
offered
,
and
at
the
same
time
he
pointed
through
the
boughs
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
.
<EOS>
Behold
Madame
,
in
shawl
,
wrapping
-
gown
,
and
slippers
,
softly
descending
the
steps
,
and
stealing
like
a
cat
round
the
garden
<EOS>
:
in
two
minutes
she
would
have
been
upon
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
If
_
<EOS>
she
_
were
like
a
cat
,
however
,
_
he
_
,
quite
as
much
,
resembled
a
leopard
:
nothing
could
be
lighter
than
his
tread
when
he
chose
.
<EOS>
He
watched
,
and
as
she
turned
a
corner
,
he
took
the
garden
at
two
noiseless
bounds
.
<EOS>
She
reappeared
,
and
he
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Rosine
helped
him
,
instantly
interposing
the
door
between
him
and
his
huntress
.
<EOS>
I
,
too
,
might
have
got
,
away
,
but
I
preferred
to
meet
Madame
openly
.
  
<EOS>
Though
it
was
my
frequent
and
well
-
known
custom
to
spend
twilight
in
the
garden
,
yet
,
never
till
now
,
had
I
remained
so
late
.
<EOS>
Full
sure
was
I
that
Madame
had
missed
 
<EOS>
was
come
in
search
of
me
,
and
designed
now
to
pounce
on
the
defaulter
unawares
.
<EOS>
I
expected
a
reprimand
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Madame
was
all
goodness
.
<EOS>
She
tendered
not
even
a
remonstrance
;
she
testified
no
shade
of
surprise
.
<EOS>
With
that
consummate
tact
of
hers
,
in
which
I
believe
she
was
never
surpassed
by
living
thing
,
she
even
professed
merely
to
have
issued
forth
to
taste
"
la
brise
du
soir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quelle
belle
nuit
!
"
<EOS>
cried
she
,
looking
up
at
the
stars
 
<EOS>
the
moon
was
now
gone
down
behind
the
broad
tower
of
Jean
Baptiste
.
"
<EOS>
Qu'il
fait
bon
?
<EOS>
que
l'air
est
frais
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
,
instead
of
sending
me
in
,
she
detained
me
to
take
a
few
turns
with
her
down
the
principal
alley
.
<EOS>
When
at
last
we
both
re
-
entered
,
she
leaned
affably
on
my
shoulder
by
way
of
support
in
mounting
the
front
-
door
steps
;
at
parting
,
her
cheek
was
presented
to
my
lips
,
and
"
Bon
soir
,
my
bonne
amie
;
dormez
bien
!
"
was
her
kindly
adieu
for
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
caught
myself
smiling
as
I
lay
awake
and
thoughtful
on
my
couch
 
smiling
at
Madame
.
<EOS>
The
unction
,
the
suavity
of
her
behaviour
offered
,
for
one
who
knew
her
,
a
sure
token
that
suspicion
of
some
kind
was
busy
in
her
brain
.
<EOS>
From
some
aperture
or
summit
of
observation
,
through
parted
bough
or
open
window
,
she
had
doubtless
caught
a
glimpse
,
remote
or
near
,
deceptive
or
instructive
,
of
that
night
's
transactions
.
<EOS>
Finely
accomplished
as
she
was
in
the
art
of
surveillance
,
it
was
next
to
impossible
that
a
casket
could
be
thrown
into
her
garden
,
or
an
interloper
could
cross
her
walks
to
seek
it
,
without
that
she
,
in
shaken
branch
,
passing
shade
,
unwonted
footfall
,
or
stilly
murmur
<EOS>
(
and
though
Dr.
John
had
spoken
very
low
in
the
few
words
he
dropped
me
,
yet
the
hum
of
his
man
's
voice
pervaded
,
I
thought
,
the
whole
conventual
ground
)
 
<EOS>
without
,
I
say
,
that
she
should
have
caught
intimation
of
things
extraordinary
transpiring
on
her
premises
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
What
<EOS>
_
things
,
she
might
by
no
means
see
,
or
at
that
time
be
able
to
discover
;
but
a
delicious
little
ravelled
plot
lay
tempting
her
to
disentanglement
;
and
in
the
midst
,
folded
round
and
round
in
cobwebs
,
had
she
not
secured
"
Meess
Lucie
"
clumsily
involved
,
like
the
foolish
fly
<EOS>
she
was
?
    
<EOS>
A
SNEEZE
OUT
OF
SEASON
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
occasion
to
smile
 
nay
,
to
laugh
,
at
Madame
again
,
within
the
space
of
four
and
twenty
hours
after
the
little
scene
treated
of
in
the
last
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
Villette

as
that
of
any
English
town
.
<EOS>
A
night
of
high
wind
followed
upon
that
soft
sunset
,
and
all
the
next
day
was
one
of
dry
storm
 
dark
,
beclouded
,
yet
rainless
,
 
the
streets
were
dim
with
sand
and
dust
,
whirled
from
the
boulevards
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
that
even
lovely
weather
would
have
tempted
me
to
spend
the
evening
-
time
of
study
and
recreation
where
I
had
spent
it
yesterday
.
<EOS>
My
alley
,
and
,
indeed
,
all
the
walks
and
shrubs
in
the
garden
,
had
acquired
a
new
,
but
not
a
pleasant
interest
;
their
seclusion
was
now
become
precarious
;
their
calm
 
insecure
.
<EOS>
That
casement
which
rained
billets
,
had
vulgarized
the
once
dear
nook
it
overlooked
;
and
elsewhere
,
the
eyes
of
the
flowers
had
gained
vision
,
and
the
knots
in
the
tree
-
boles
listened
like
secret
ears
.
<EOS>
Some
plants
there
were
,
indeed
,
trodden
down
by
Dr.
John
in
his
search
,
and
his
hasty
and
heedless
progress
,
which
I
wished
to
prop
up
,
water
,
and
revive
;
some
footmarks
,
too
<EOS>
,
he
had
left
on
the
beds
:
but
these
,
in
spite
of
the
strong
wind
,
I
found
a
moment
's
leisure
to
efface
very
early
in
the
morning
,
ere
common
eyes
had
discovered
them
.
<EOS>
With
a
pensive
sort
of
content
,
I
sat
down
to
my
desk
and
my
German
,
while
the
pupils
settled
to
their
evening
lessons
;
and
the
other
teachers
took
up
their
needlework
.
  
<EOS>
The
scene
of
the
"
etude
du
soir
"
was
always
the
refectory
,
a
much
smaller
apartment
than
any
of
the
three
classes
or
schoolrooms
;
for
here
none
,
save
the
boarders
,
were
ever
admitted
,
and
these
numbered
only
a
score
.
<EOS>
Two
lamps
hung
from
the
ceiling
over
the
two
tables
;
these
were
lit
at
dusk
,
and
their
kindling
was
the
signal
for
school
-
books
being
set
aside
,
a
grave
demeanour
assumed
,
general
silence
enforced
,
and
then
commenced
"
la
lecture
pieuse
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
said
"
lecture
pieuse
"
was
,
I
soon
found
,
mainly
designed
as
a
wholesome
mortification
of
the
Intellect
,
a
useful
humiliation
of
the
Reason
;
and
such
a
dose
for
Common
Sense
as
she
might
digest
at
her
leisure
,
and
thrive
on
as
she
best
could
.
  
<EOS>
The
book
brought
out
(
it
was
never
changed
,
but
when
finished
,
recommenced
)
was
a
venerable
volume
,
old
as
the
hills
 
grey
as
the
Hôtel
de
Ville
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
given
two
francs
for
the
chance
of
getting
that
book
once
into
my
bands
,
turning
over
the
sacred
yellow
leaves
,
ascertaining
the
title
,
and
perusing
with
my
own
eyes
the
enormous
figments
which
,
as
an
unworthy
heretic
,
it
was
only
permitted
me
to
drink
in
with
my
bewildered
ears
.
<EOS>
This
book
contained
legends
of
the
saints
.
<EOS>
Good
God
!
<EOS>
(
I
speak
the
words
reverently
)
<EOS>
what
legends
they
were
.
<EOS>
What
gasconading
rascals
those
saints
must
have
been
,
if
they
first
boasted
these
exploits
or
invented
these
miracles
.
<EOS>
These
legends
,
however
,
were
no
more
than
monkish
extravagances
,
over
which
one
laughed
inwardly
;
there
were
,
besides
,
priestly
matters
,
and
the
priestcraft
of
the
book
was
far
worse
than
its
monkery
.
<EOS>
The
ears
burned
on
each
side
of
my
head
as
I
listened
,
perforce
,
to
tales
of
moral
martyrdom
inflicted
by
Rome
;
the
dread
boasts
of
confessors
,
who
had
wickedly
abused
their
office
,
trampling
to
deep
degradation
high
-
born
ladies
,
making
of
countesses
and
princesses
the
most
tormented
slaves
under
the
sun
.
<EOS>
Stories
like
that
of
Conrad
and
Elizabeth
of
Hungary
,
recurred
again
and
again
,
with
all
its
dreadful
viciousness
,
sickening
tyranny
and
black
impiety
:
tales
that
were
nightmares
of
oppression
,
privation
,
and
agony
.
  
<EOS>
I
sat
out
this
"
lecture
pieuse
"
for
some
nights
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
as
quietly
too
;
only
once
breaking
off
the
points
of
my
scissors
by
involuntarily
sticking
them
somewhat
deep
in
the
worm
-
eaten
board
of
the
table
before
me
.
<EOS>
But
,
at
last
,
it
made
me
so
burning
hot
,
and
my
temples
,
and
my
heart
,
and
my
wrist
throbbed
so
fast
,
and
my
sleep
afterwards
was
so
broken
with
excitement
,
that
I
could
sit
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Prudence
recommended
henceforward
a
swift
clearance
of
my
person
from
the
place
,
the
moment
that
guilty
old
book
was
brought
out
.
<EOS>
No
Mause
Headrigg
ever
felt
a
stronger
call
to
take
up
her
testimony
against
Sergeant
Bothwell
,
than
I
 
to
speak
my
mind
in
this
matter
of
the
popish
"
lecture
pieuse
.
"
<EOS>
However
,
I
did
manage
somehow
to
curb
and
rein
in
;
and
though
always
,
as
soon
as
Rosine
came
to
light
the
lamps
,
I
shot
from
the
room
quickly
,
yet
also
I
did
it
quietly
;
seizing
that
vantage
moment
given
by
the
little
bustle
before
the
dead
silence
,
and
vanishing
whilst
the
boarders
put
their
books
away
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
vanished
 
it
was
into
darkness
;
candles
were
not
allowed
to
be
carried
about
,
and
the
teacher
who
forsook
the
refectory
,
had
only
the
unlit
hall
,
schoolroom
,
or
bedroom
,
as
a
refuge
.
<EOS>
In
winter
I
sought
the
long
classes
,
and
paced
them
fast
to
keep
myself
warm
 
fortunate
if
the
moon
shone
,
and
if
there
were
only
stars
,
soon
reconciled
to
their
dim
gleam
,
or
even
to
the
total
eclipse
of
their
absence
.
<EOS>
In
summer
it
was
never
quite
dark
,
and
then
I
went
up
-
stairs
to
my
own
quarter
of
the
long
dormitory
,
opened
my
own
casement
<EOS>
(
that
chamber
was
lit
by
five
casements
large
as
great
doors
)
,
and
leaning
out
,
looked
forth
upon
the
city
beyond
the
garden
,
and
listened
to
band
-
music
from
the
park
or
the
palace
-
square
,
thinking
meantime
my
own
thoughts
,
living
my
own
life
,
in
my
own
still
,
shadow
-
world
.
  
<EOS>
This
evening
,
fugitive
as
usual
before
the
Pope
and
his
works
,
I
mounted
the
staircase
,
approached
the
dormitory
,
and
quietly
opened
the
door
,
which
was
always
kept
carefully
shut
,
and
which
,
like
every
other
door
in
this
house
,
revolved
noiselessly
on
well
-
oiled
hinges
.
<EOS>
Before
I
_
saw
_
,
I
_
felt
_
<EOS>
that
life
was
in
the
great
room
,
usually
void
:
not
that
there
was
either
stir
or
breath
,
or
rustle
of
sound
,
but
Vacuum
lacked
,
Solitude
was
not
at
home
.
<EOS>
All
the
white
beds
 
the
"
lits
d'ange
,
"
as
they
were
poetically
termed
 
lay
visible
at
a
glance
;
all
were
empty
:
no
sleeper
reposed
therein
.
<EOS>
The
sound
of
a
drawer
cautiously
slid
out
struck
my
ear
;
stepping
a
little
to
one
side
,
my
vision
took
a
free
range
,
unimpeded
by
falling
curtains
.
<EOS>
I
now
commanded
my
own
bed
and
my
own
toilet
,
with
a
locked
work
-
box
upon
it
,
and
locked
drawers
underneath
.
  
<EOS>
Very
good
.
<EOS>
A
dumpy
,
motherly
little
body
,
in
decent
shawl
and
the
cleanest
of
possible
nightcaps
,
stood
before
this
toilet
,
hard
at
work
apparently
doing
me
the
kindness
of
"
tidying
out
"
the
"
meuble
.
"
<EOS>
Open
stood
the
lid
of
the
work
-
box
,
open
the
top
drawer
;
duly
and
impartially
<EOS>
was
each
succeeding
drawer
opened
in
turn
:
not
an
article
of
their
contents
but
was
lifted
and
unfolded
,
not
a
paper
but
was
glanced
over
,
not
a
little
box
but
was
unlidded
;
and
beautiful
was
the
adroitness
,
exemplary
the
care
with
which
the
search
was
accomplished
.
<EOS>
Madame
wrought
at
it
like
a
true
star
,
"
unhasting
yet
unresting
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
deny
that
it
was
with
a
secret
glee
I
watched
her
.
<EOS>
Had
I
been
a
gentleman
<EOS>
I
believe
Madame
would
have
found
favour
in
my
eyes
,
she
was
so
handy
,
neat
,
<EOS>
thorough
in
all
<EOS>
she
did
:
some
people
's
movements
provoke
the
soul
by
their
loose
awkwardness
,
hers
 
satisfied
by
their
trim
compactness
.
<EOS>
I
stood
,
in
short
,
fascinated
;
but
it
was
necessary
to
make
an
effort
to
break
this
spell
a
retreat
must
be
beaten
.
<EOS>
The
searcher
might
have
turned
and
caught
me
;
there
would
have
been
nothing
for
it
then
but
a
scene
,
and
she
and
I
would
have
had
to
come
all
at
once
,
with
a
sudden
clash
,
to
a
thorough
knowledge
of
each
other
:
down
would
have
gone
conventionalities
,
away
swept
disguises
,
and
_
I
_
should
have
looked
into
her
eyes
,
and
she
into
mine
 
<EOS>
we
should
have
known
that
we
could
work
together
no
more
,
and
parted
in
this
life
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
Where
was
the
use
of
tempting
such
a
catastrophe
?
<EOS>
I
was
not
angry
,
and
had
no
wish
in
the
world
to
leave
her
.
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
get
another
employer
whose
yoke
would
be
so
light
and
so
,
easy
of
carriage
;
and
truly
I
liked
Madame
for
her
capital
sense
,
whatever
I
might
think
of
her
principles
:
<EOS>
as
to
her
system
,
it
did
me
no
harm
;
she
might
work
me
with
it
to
her
heart
's
content
:
<EOS>
nothing
would
come
of
the
operation
.
<EOS>
Loverless
and
inexpectant
of
love
,
I
was
as
safe
from
spies
in
my
heart
-
poverty
,
as
the
beggar
from
thieves
in
his
destitution
of
purse
.
<EOS>
I
turned
,
then
,
and
fled
;
descending
the
stairs
with
progress
as
swift
and
soundless
as
that
of
the
spider
,
which
at
the
same
instant
ran
down
the
bannister
.
  
<EOS>
How
I
laughed
when
I
reached
the
schoolroom
.
<EOS>
I
knew
now
she
had
certainly
seen
Dr.
John
in
the
garden
;
I
knew
what
her
thoughts
were
.
<EOS>
The
spectacle
of
a
suspicious
nature
so
far
misled
by
its
own
inventions
,
tickled
me
much
.
<EOS>
Yet
as
the
laugh
died
,
a
kind
of
wrath
smote
me
,
and
then
bitterness
followed
:
it
was
the
rock
struck
,
and
Meribah
's
waters
gushing
out
.
<EOS>
I
never
had
felt
so
strange
and
contradictory
an
inward
tumult
as
I
felt
for
an
hour
that
evening
:
soreness
and
laughter
,
and
fire
,
and
grief
,
shared
my
heart
between
them
.
<EOS>
I
cried
hot
tears
:
not
because
Madame
mistrusted
me
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
care
twopence
for
her
mistrust
 
but
for
other
reasons
.
<EOS>
Complicated
,
disquieting
thoughts
broke
up
the
whole
repose
of
my
nature
.
<EOS>
However
,
that
turmoil
subsided
:
next
day
I
was
again
Lucy
Snowe
.
  
<EOS>
On
revisiting
my
drawers
,
I
found
them
all
securely
locked
;
the
closest
subsequent
examination
could
not
discover
change
or
apparent
disturbance
in
the
position
of
one
object
.
<EOS>
My
few
dresses
were
folded
as
I
had
left
them
;
a
certain
little
bunch
of
white
violets
that
had
once
been
silently
presented
to
me
by
a
stranger
(
a
stranger
to
me
,
for
we
had
never
exchanged
words
)
,
and
which
I
had
dried
and
kept
for
its
sweet
perfume
between
the
folds
of
my
best
dress
,
lay
there
unstirred
;
my
black
silk
scarf
,
my
lace
chemisette
and
collars
,
were
unrumpled
.
<EOS>
Had
she
creased
one
solitary
article
<EOS>
,
I
own
I
should
have
felt
much
greater
difficulty
in
forgiving
her
;
but
finding
all
straight
and
orderly
<EOS>
,
I
said
,
"
Let
bygones
be
bygones
.
<EOS>
I
am
unharmed
:
why
should
I
bear
malice
?
"
     
<EOS>
A
thing
there
was
which
puzzled
myself
,
and
I
sought
in
my
brain
a
key
to
that
riddle
almost
as
sedulously
as
Madame
had
sought
a
guide
to
useful
knowledge
in
my
toilet
drawers
.
<EOS>
How
was
it
that
Dr.
John
,
if
he
had
not
been
accessory
to
the
dropping
of
that
casket
into
the
garden
,
should
have
known
that
it
_
was
_
dropped
,
and
appeared
so
promptly
on
the
spot
to
seek
it
?
<EOS>
So
strong
was
the
wish
to
clear
up
this
point
that
I
began
to
entertain
this
daring
suggestion
:
<EOS>
"
Why
may
I
not
,
in
case
I
should
ever
have
the
opportunity
,
ask
Dr.
John
himself
to
explain
this
coincidence
?
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
long
as
Dr.
John
was
absent
,
I
really
believed
I
had
courage
to
test
him
with
such
a
question
.
  
<EOS>
Little
Georgette
was
now
convalescent
;
and
her
physician
accordingly
made
his
visits
very
rare
:
indeed
,
he
would
have
ceased
them
altogether
,
had
not
Madame
insisted
on
his
giving
an
occasional
call
till
the
child
should
be
quite
well
.
  
<EOS>
She
came
into
the
nursery
one
evening
just
after
I
had
listened
to
Georgette
's
lisped
and
broken
prayer
,
and
had
put
her
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Taking
the
little
one
's
hand
,
she
said
,
"
Cette
enfant
a
toujours
un
peu
de
fièvre
.
"
<EOS>
And
presently
afterwards
,
looking
at
me
with
a
quicker
glance
than
was
habitual
to
her
quiet
eye
,
"
Le
Docteur
John
l'a
-
t
-
il
vue
dernièrement
?
<EOS>
Non
,
n'est
-
ce
pas
?
"
  
<EOS>
Of
course
she
knew
this
better
than
any
other
person
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
she
continued
,
"
I
am
going
out
,
pour
faire
quelques
courses
en
fiacre
.
<EOS>
I
shall
call
on
Dr.
John
,
and
send
him
to
the
child
.
<EOS>
I
will
that
he
sees
her
this
evening
;
her
cheeks
are
flushed
,
her
pulse
is
quick
;
_
you
_
will
receive
him
 
for
my
part
,
I
shall
be
from
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
Now
the
child
was
well
enough
,
only
warm
with
the
warmth
of
July
;
it
was
scarcely
less
needful
to
send
for
a
priest
to
administer
extreme
unction
than
for
a
doctor
to
prescribe
a
dose
;
also
Madame
rarely
made
"
courses
,
"
as
she
called
them
,
in
the
evening
:
<EOS>
moreover
,
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
chosen
to
absent
herself
on
the
occasion
of
a
visit
from
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
The
whole
arrangement
indicated
some
plan
;
this
I
saw
,
but
without
the
least
anxiety
.
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
Madame
,
"
laughed
Light
-
heart
the
Beggar
,
"
your
crafty
wits
are
on
the
wrong
tack
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
departed
,
attired
very
smartly
,
in
a
shawl
of
price
,
and
a
certain
_
chapeau
vert
tendre
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
hazardous
,
as
to
its
tint
,
for
any
complexion
less
fresh
than
her
own
,
but
,
to
her
,
not
unbecoming
.
<EOS>
I
wondered
what
she
intended
:
whether
she
really
would
send
Dr.
John
or
not
;
or
whether
indeed
he
would
come
:
he
might
be
engaged
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
had
charged
me
not
to
let
Georgette
sleep
till
the
doctor
came
;
I
had
therefore
sufficient
occupation
in
telling
her
nursery
tales
and
palavering
the
little
language
for
her
benefit
.
<EOS>
I
affected
Georgette
;
she
was
a
sensitive
and
a
loving
child
:
to
hold
her
in
my
lap
,
or
carry
her
in
my
arms
,
was
to
me
a
treat
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
she
would
have
me
lay
my
head
on
the
pillow
of
her
crib
;
she
even
put
her
little
arms
<EOS>
round
my
neck
.
<EOS>
Her
clasp
,
and
the
nestling
action
with
which
she
pressed
her
cheek
to
mine
,
made
me
almost
cry
with
a
tender
pain
.
<EOS>
Feeling
of
no
kind
abounded
in
that
house
;
this
pure
little
drop
from
a
pure
little
source
was
too
sweet
:
it
penetrated
deep
,
and
subdued
the
heart
,
and
sent
a
gush
to
the
eyes
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
or
an
hour
passed
;
Georgette
murmured
in
her
soft
lisp
that
she
was
growing
sleepy
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
_
shall
_
sleep
,
"
thought
I
,
"
malgré
maman
and
médecin
,
if
they
are
not
here
in
ten
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
There
was
the
ring
,
and
there
the
tread
,
astonishing
the
staircase
by
the
fleetness
with
which
it
left
the
steps
behind
.
<EOS>
Rosine
introduced
Dr.
John
,
and
,
with
a
freedom
of
manner
not
altogether
peculiar
to
herself
,
but
characteristic
of
the
domestics
of
Villette
<EOS>
generally
,
she
stayed
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
.
<EOS>
Madame
's
presence
would
have
awed
her
back
to
her
own
realm
of
the
vestibule
and
the
cabinet
 
for
mine
,
or
that
of
any
other
teacher
or
pupil
,
she
cared
not
a
jot
.
<EOS>
Smart
,
trim
and
pert
,
she
stood
,
a
hand
in
each
pocket
of
her
gay
grisette
apron
,
eyeing
Dr.
John
with
no
more
fear
or
shyness
than
if
he
had
been
a
picture
instead
of
a
living
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Le
marmot
n'a
rien
,
nest
-
ce
pas
?
<EOS>
"
said
she
,
indicating
Georgette
with
a
jerk
of
her
chin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pas
beaucoup
,
"
was
the
answer
,
as
the
doctor
hastily
scribbled
with
his
pencil
some
harmless
prescription
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
bien
!
"
pursued
Rosine
,
approaching
him
quite
near
,
while
he
put
up
his
pencil
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
box
 
<EOS>
did
you
get
it
?
<EOS>
Monsieur
went
off
like
a
coup
-
de
-
vent
the
other
night
;
I
had
not
time
to
ask
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
found
it
:
yes
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
who
threw
it
,
then
?
"
<EOS>
continued
Rosine
,
speaking
quite
freely
the
very
words
I
should
so
much
have
wished
to
say
,
but
had
no
address
or
courage
to
bring
it
out
<EOS>
:
how
short
some
people
make
the
road
to
a
point
which
,
for
others
,
seems
unattainable
!
  
<EOS>
"
That
may
be
my
secret
,
"
rejoined
Dr.
John
briefly
,
but
with
no
,
sort
of
hauteur
:
he
seemed
quite
to
understand
the
Rosine
or
grisette
character
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mais
enfin
,
"
continued
she
,
nothing
abashed
,
"
monsieur
knew
it
was
thrown
,
since
he
came
to
seek
it
 
<EOS>
how
did
he
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
attending
a
little
patient
in
the
college
near
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
saw
it
dropped
out
of
his
chamber
window
,
and
so
came
to
pick
it
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
How
simple
the
whole
explanation
!
<EOS>
The
note
had
alluded
to
a
physician
as
then
examining
"
Gustave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
ça
!
"
pursued
Rosine
;
"
il
n'y
a
donc
rien
là
-
dessous
:
<EOS>
pas
de
mystère
,
pas
d'amourette
,
par
exemple
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pas
plus
que
sur
ma
main
,
"
responded
the
doctor
,
showing
his
palm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quel
dommage
!
"
responded
the
grisette
:
"
<EOS>
et
moi
 
<EOS>
à
qui
tout
<EOS>
cela
commençait
à
donner
<EOS>
des
idées
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Vraiment
!
vous
en
<EOS>
êtes
pour
vos
frais
<EOS>
,
"
was
the
doctor
's
cool
rejoinder
.
  
<EOS>
She
pouted
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
sort
of
"
moue
"
she
made
:
<EOS>
when
he
laughed
,
he
had
something
peculiarly
good
-
natured
and
genial
in
his
look
.
<EOS>
I
saw
his
hand
incline
to
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
many
times
have
you
opened
the
door
for
me
within
this
last
month
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
ought
to
have
kept
count
of
that
,
"
said
Rosine
,
quite
readily
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
if
I
had
not
something
better
to
do
!
"
rejoined
he
;
but
I
saw
him
give
her
a
piece
of
gold
,
which
she
took
unscrupulously
,
and
then
danced
off
to
answer
the
door
-
bell
,
ringing
just
now
every
five
minutes
,
as
the
various
servants
came
to
fetch
the
half
-
boarders
.
  
<EOS>
The
reader
must
not
think
too
hardly
of
Rosine
;
on
the
whole
,
she
was
not
a
bad
sort
of
person
,
and
had
no
idea
there
could
be
any
disgrace
in
grasping
at
whatever
she
could
get
,
or
any
effrontery
in
chattering
like
a
pie
to
the
best
gentleman
in
Christendom
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
learnt
something
from
the
above
scene
besides
what
concerned
the
ivory
box
:
viz
.
,
that
not
on
the
robe
de
jaconas
,
pink
or
grey
,
nor
yet
on
the
frilled
and
pocketed
apron
,
lay
the
blame
of
breaking
Dr.
John
's
heart
:
these
items
of
array
were
obviously
guiltless
as
Georgette
's
little
blue
tunic
.
<EOS>
So
much
the
better
.
<EOS>
But
who
then
was
the
culprit
?
<EOS>
What
was
the
ground
 
<EOS>
what
the
origin
 
<EOS>
what
the
perfect
explanation
of
the
whole
business
?
<EOS>
Some
points
had
been
cleared
,
but
how
many
yet
remained
obscure
as
night
!
  
<EOS>
"
However
,
"
I
said
to
myself
,
"
it
is
no
affair
of
yours
;
"
and
turning
from
the
face
on
which
I
had
been
unconsciously
dwelling
with
a
questioning
gaze
<EOS>
,
I
looked
through
the
window
which
commanded
the
garden
below
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
,
meantime
,
standing
by
the
bed
-
side
,
was
slowly
drawing
on
his
gloves
and
watching
his
little
patient
,
as
her
eyes
closed
and
her
rosy
lips
parted
in
coming
sleep
.
<EOS>
I
waited
till
he
should
depart
as
usual
,
with
a
quick
bow
and
scarce
articulate
"
good
-
night
.
"
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
took
his
hat
,
my
eyes
,
fixed
on
the
tall
houses
bounding
the
garden
,
saw
the
one
lattice
,
already
commemorated
,
cautiously
open
;
forth
from
the
aperture
projected
a
hand
and
a
white
handkerchief
;
both
waved
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
the
signal
was
answered
from
some
viewless
quarter
of
our
own
dwelling
;
but
immediately
after
there
fluttered
from
,
the
lattice
a
falling
object
,
white
and
light
 
billet
the
second
,
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
<EOS>
"
I
ejaculated
involuntarily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
,
asked
Dr.
John
with
energy
,
making
direct
for
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
What
,
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
gone
and
done
it
again
,
"
was
my
reply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
handkerchief
waved
and
something
fell
:
"
<EOS>
and
I
pointed
to
the
lattice
,
now
closed
and
looking
hypocritically
blank
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
,
at
once
;
pick
it
up
and
bring
it
here
,
"
was
his
prompt
direction
;
adding
,
"
Nobody
will
take
notice
of
_
you
:
I
_
should
be
seen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Straight
I
went
.
<EOS>
After
some
little
search
,
I
found
a
folded
paper
,
lodged
on
the
lower
branch
of
a
shrub
;
I
seized
and
brought
it
direct
to
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
This
time
,
I
believe
not
even
Rosine
saw
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
instantly
tore
the
billet
into
small
pieces
,
without
reading
it
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
in
the
least
_
her
_
fault
,
you
must
remember
,
"
he
said
,
looking
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
Whose
_
fault
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Who
_
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
yet
know
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
no
guess
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
knew
you
better
,
I
might
be
tempted
to
risk
some
confidence
,
and
thus
secure
you
as
guardian
over
a
most
innocent
and
excellent
,
but
somewhat
inexperienced
being
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
a
duenna
?
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
he
abstractedly
.
<EOS>
"
What
snares
are
round
her
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
musingly
:
and
now
,
certainly
for
the
first
time
,
he
examined
my
face
,
anxious
,
doubtless
,
to
see
if
any
kindly
expression
there
,
would
warrant
him
in
recommending
to
my
care
and
indulgence
some
ethereal
creature
,
against
whom
powers
of
darkness
were
plotting
.
<EOS>
I
felt
no
particular
vocation
to
undertake
the
surveillance
of
ethereal
creatures
;
but
recalling
the
scene
at
the
bureau
,
it
seemed
to
me
that
I
owed
_
him
_
<EOS>
a
good
turn
<EOS>
:
if
I
_
could
_
help
him
<EOS>
then
I
would
,
and
it
lay
not
with
me
to
decide
how
.
<EOS>
With
as
little
reluctance
as
might
be
,
I
intimated
that
"
I
was
willing
to
do
what
I
could
towards
taking
care
of
any
person
in
whom
he
might
be
interested
.
"
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
no
farther
interested
than
as
a
spectator
,
"
said
he
,
with
a
modesty
,
admirable
,
as
I
thought
,
to
witness
.
<EOS>
"
I
happen
to
be
acquainted
with
the
rather
worthless
character
of
the
person
,
who
,
from
the
house
opposite
,
has
now
twice
invaded
the
sanctity
of
this
place
;
I
have
also
met
in
society
the
object
at
whom
these
vulgar
attempts
are
aimed
.
<EOS>
Her
exquisite
superiority
and
innate
refinement
ought
,
one
would
think
,
to
scare
impertinence
from
her
very
idea
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
so
,
however
;
and
innocent
,
unsuspicious
as
she
is
,
I
would
guard
her
from
evil
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
In
person
,
however
,
I
can
do
nothing
I
can
not
come
near
her
<EOS>
"
 
he
paused
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
am
willing
to
help
you
,
"
said
I
,
"
only
tell
me
how
.
"
<EOS>
And
busily
,
in
my
own
mind
,
I
ran
over
the
list
of
our
inmates
,
seeking
this
paragon
,
this
pearl
of
great
price
,
this
gem
without
flaw
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
Madame
,
"
I
concluded
.
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
<EOS>
only
,
amongst
us
all
,
has
the
art
even
to
_
<EOS>
seem
_
superior
:
<EOS>
but
as
to
being
unsuspicious
,
inexperienced
,
&
c.
,
Dr.
John
need
not
distract
himself
about
that
.
<EOS>
However
,
this
is
just
his
whim
,
and
I
will
not
contradict
him
;
he
shall
be
humoured
:
his
angel
shall
be
an
angel
.
  
<EOS>
"
Just
notify
the
quarter
to
which
my
care
is
to
be
directed
,
"
I
continued
gravely
:
chuckling
,
however
,
to
myself
over
the
thought
of
being
set
to
chaperon
Madame
Beck
or
any
of
her
pupils
.
<EOS>
Now
Dr.
John
had
a
fine
set
of
nerves
,
and
he
at
once
felt
by
instinct
,
what
no
more
coarsely
constituted
mind
would
have
detected
;
namely
,
that
I
was
a
little
amused
at
him
.
<EOS>
The
colour
rose
to
his
cheek
;
with
half
a
smile
he
turned
and
took
his
hat
 
<EOS>
he
was
going
.
<EOS>
My
heart
smote
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
 
I
will
help
you
,
"
said
I
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
what
you
wish
.
<EOS>
I
will
watch
over
your
angel
;
I
will
take
care
of
her
,
only
tell
me
who
she
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
_
must
_
know
,
"
said
he
then
with
earnestness
,
yet
speaking
very
low
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
spotless
,
so
good
,
so
unspeakably
beautiful
!
<EOS>
impossible
that
one
house
should
contain
two
like
her
.
<EOS>
I
allude
,
of
course
 
"
  
<EOS>
Here
the
latch
of
Madame
Beck
's
chamber
-
door
(
opening
into
the
nursery
)
gave
a
sudden
click
,
as
if
the
hand
holding
it
had
been
slightly
convulsed
;
there
was
the
suppressed
explosion
of
an
irrepressible
sneeze
.
<EOS>
These
little
accidents
will
happen
to
the
best
of
us
.
<EOS>
Madame
 
excellent
woman
!
<EOS>
was
then
on
duty
.
<EOS>
She
had
come
home
quietly
,
stolen
up
-
stairs
on
tip
-
toe
;
she
was
in
her
chamber
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
not
sneezed
,
she
would
have
heard
all
,
and
so
should
I
;
but
that
unlucky
sternutation
routed
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
While
he
stood
aghast
,
she
came
forward
alert
,
composed
,
in
the
best
yet
most
tranquil
spirits
:
<EOS>
no
novice
to
her
habits
but
would
have
thought
she
had
just
come
in
,
and
scouted
the
idea
of
her
ear
having
been
glued
to
the
key
-
hole
for
at
least
ten
minutes
.
<EOS>
She
affected
to
sneeze
again
,
declared
she
was
"
enrhumée
,
"
and
then
proceeded
volubly
to
recount
her
"
courses
en
fiacre
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
prayer
-
bell
rang
,
and
I
left
her
with
the
doctor
.
    
<EOS>
THE
FÊTE
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Georgette
was
well
,
Madame
sent
her
away
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
was
sorry
;
I
loved
the
child
,
and
her
loss
made
me
poorer
than
before
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
not
complain
.
<EOS>
I
lived
in
a
house
full
of
robust
life
;
I
might
have
had
companions
,
and
I
chose
solitude
.
<EOS>
Each
of
the
teachers
in
turn
made
me
overtures
of
special
intimacy
;
I
tried
them
all
.
<EOS>
One
I
found
to
be
an
honest
woman
,
but
a
narrow
thinker
,
a
coarse
feeler
,
and
an
egotist
.
<EOS>
The
second
was
a
Parisienne
,
externally
refined
 
at
heart
,
corrupt
 
without
a
creed
,
without
a
principle
,
without
an
affection
:
having
penetrated
the
outward
crust
of
decorum
in
this
character
,
you
found
a
slough
beneath
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
wonderful
passion
for
presents
;
and
,
in
this
point
,
the
third
teacher
 
a
person
otherwise
characterless
and
insignificant
 
closely
resembled
her
.
<EOS>
This
last
-
named
had
also
one
other
distinctive
property
 
that
of
avarice
.
<EOS>
In
her
reigned
the
love
of
money
for
its
own
sake
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
a
piece
of
gold
would
bring
into
her
eyes
a
green
glisten
,
singular
to
witness
.
<EOS>
She
once
,
as
a
mark
of
high
favour
,
took
me
up
-
stairs
,
and
,
opening
a
secret
door
,
showed
me
a
hoard
 
<EOS>
a
mass
of
coarse
,
large
coin
 
about
fifteen
guineas
,
in
five
-
franc
pieces
.
<EOS>
She
loved
this
hoard
as
a
bird
loves
its
eggs
.
<EOS>
These
were
her
savings
.
<EOS>
She
would
come
and
talk
to
me
about
them
with
an
infatuated
and
persevering
dotage
,
strange
to
behold
in
a
person
not
yet
twenty
-
five
.
  
<EOS>
The
Parisienne
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
prodigal
and
profligate
(
in
disposition
,
that
is
:
as
to
action
,
I
do
not
know
)
.
<EOS>
That
latter
quality
showed
its
snake
-
head
to
me
but
once
,
peeping
out
very
cautiously
.
<EOS>
A
curious
kind
of
reptile
it
seemed
,
judging
from
the
glimpse
I
got
;
its
novelty
whetted
my
curiosity
:
if
it
would
have
come
out
boldly
,
perhaps
I
might
philosophically
have
stood
my
ground
,
and
coolly
surveyed
the
long
thing
from
forked
tongue
to
scaly
tail
-
tip
;
but
it
merely
rustled
in
the
leaves
of
a
bad
novel
;
and
,
on
encountering
a
hasty
and
ill
-
advised
demonstration
of
wrath
,
recoiled
and
vanished
,
hissing
.
<EOS>
She
hated
me
from
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
This
Parisienne
was
always
in
debt
;
her
salary
being
anticipated
,
not
only
in
dress
,
but
in
perfumes
,
cosmetics
,
confectionery
,
and
condiments
.
<EOS>
What
a
cold
,
callous
epicure
she
was
in
all
things
!
<EOS>
I
see
her
now
.
<EOS>
Thin
in
face
and
figure
,
sallow
in
complexion
,
regular
in
features
,
with
perfect
teeth
,
lips
like
a
thread
,
a
large
,
prominent
chin
,
a
well
-
opened
,
but
frozen
eye
,
of
light
at
once
craving
and
ingrate
.
<EOS>
She
mortally
hated
work
,
and
loved
what
she
called
pleasure
;
being
an
insipid
,
heartless
,
brainless
dissipation
of
time
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
knew
this
woman
's
character
perfectly
well
.
<EOS>
She
once
talked
to
me
about
her
,
with
an
odd
mixture
of
discrimination
,
indifference
,
and
antipathy
.
<EOS>
I
asked
why
she
kept
her
in
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
She
answered
plainly
,
"
because
it
suited
her
interest
to
do
so
;
"
and
pointed
out
a
fact
I
had
already
noticed
,
namely
,
that
Mademoiselle
St.
Pierre
possessed
,
in
an
almost
unique
degree
,
the
power
of
keeping
order
amongst
her
undisciplined
ranks
of
scholars
.
<EOS>
A
certain
petrifying
influence
accompanied
and
surrounded
her
:
<EOS>
without
passion
,
noise
,
or
violence
,
she
held
them
in
check
as
a
breezeless
frost
-
air
might
still
a
brawling
stream
.
<EOS>
She
was
of
little
use
as
far
as
communication
of
knowledge
went
,
but
for
strict
surveillance
and
maintenance
of
rules
she
was
invaluable
.
"
<EOS>
Je
sais
bien
<EOS>
qu'elle
n'a
pas
de
principes
,
ni
,
<EOS>
peut
-
être
,
de
moeurs
,
"
admitted
Madame
frankly
;
but
added
with
philosophy
,
"
son
maintien
en
classe
est
toujours
<EOS>
convenable
et
rempli
même
d'une
<EOS>
certaine
dignité
:
<EOS>
c'est
tout
ce
qu'il
faut
.
<EOS>
Ni
<EOS>
les
élèves
ni
<EOS>
les
parents
ne
regardent
plus
loin
;
ni
,
par
conséquent
,
moi
non
plus
.
"
     
<EOS>
A
strange
,
frolicsome
,
noisy
little
world
was
this
school
:
great
pains
were
taken
to
hide
chains
with
flowers
:
a
subtle
essence
of
Romanism
pervaded
every
arrangement
:
large
sensual
indulgence
(
so
to
speak
)
was
permitted
by
way
of
counterpoise
to
jealous
spiritual
restraint
.
<EOS>
Each
mind
was
being
reared
in
slavery
;
but
,
to
prevent
reflection
from
dwelling
on
this
fact
,
every
pretext
for
physical
recreation
was
seized
and
made
the
most
of
.
<EOS>
There
,
as
elsewhere
,
the
CHURCH
strove
to
bring
up
her
children
robust
in
body
,
feeble
in
soul
,
fat
,
ruddy
,
hale
,
joyous
,
ignorant
,
unthinking
,
unquestioning
.
<EOS>
"
Eat
,
drink
,
and
live
!
"
she
says
.
<EOS>
"
Look
after
your
bodies
;
leave
your
souls
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
hold
their
cure
 
<EOS>
guide
their
course
<EOS>
:
I
guarantee
their
final
fate
.
"
<EOS>
A
bargain
,
in
which
every
true
Catholic
deems
himself
a
gainer
.
<EOS>
Lucifer
just
offers
the
same
terms
:
"
All
this
power
will
I
give
thee
,
and
the
glory
of
it
;
for
that
is
delivered
unto
me
,
and
to
whomsoever
I
<EOS>
will
I
give
it
.
<EOS>
If
thou
,
therefore
,
wilt
worship
me
,
all
shall
be
thine
!
"
  
<EOS>
About
this
time
 
in
the
ripest
glow
of
summer
 
Madame
Beck
's
house
became
as
merry
a
place
as
a
school
could
well
be
.
<EOS>
All
day
long
the
broad
folding
-
doors
and
the
two
-
leaved
casements
stood
wide
open
:
settled
sunshine
seemed
naturalized
in
the
atmosphere
;
clouds
were
far
off
,
sailing
away
beyond
sea
,
resting
,
no
doubt
,
round
islands
such
as
England
 
that
dear
land
of
mists
 
but
withdrawn
wholly
from
the
drier
continent
.
<EOS>
We
lived
far
more
in
the
garden
than
under
a
roof
:
classes
were
held
,
and
meals
partaken
of
,
in
the
"
grand
berceau
.
"
<EOS>
Moreover
,
there
was
a
note
of
holiday
preparation
,
which
almost
turned
freedom
into
licence
.
<EOS>
The
autumnal
long
vacation
was
but
two
months
distant
;
but
before
that
,
a
great
day
 
an
important
ceremony
 
none
other
than
the
fête
of
Madame
 
awaited
celebration
.
  
<EOS>
The
conduct
of
this
fête
devolved
chiefly
on
Mademoiselle
St.
Pierre
:
<EOS>
Madame
herself
being
supposed
to
stand
aloof
,
disinterestedly
unconscious
of
what
might
be
going
forward
in
her
honour
.
<EOS>
Especially
,
she
never
knew
,
never
in
the
least
suspected
,
that
a
subscription
was
annually
levied
on
the
whole
school
for
the
purchase
of
a
handsome
present
.
<EOS>
The
polite
tact
of
the
reader
will
please
to
leave
out
of
the
account
a
brief
,
secret
consultation
on
this
point
in
Madame
's
own
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
will
you
have
this
year
?
"
was
asked
by
her
Parisian
lieutenant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
matter
!
<EOS>
Let
it
alone
.
<EOS>
Let
the
poor
children
keep
their
francs
,
"
And
Madame
looked
benign
and
modest
.
  
<EOS>
The
St.
Pierre
would
here
protrude
her
chin
;
she
knew
Madame
by
heart
;
she
always
called
her
airs
of
"
bonté
"
 
"
des
grimaces
.
<EOS>
"
She
never
even
professed
to
respect
them
one
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Vite
!
<EOS>
"
she
would
say
coldly
.
"
<EOS>
Name
the
article
.
<EOS>
Shall
it
be
jewellery
or
porcelain
,
haberdashery
or
silver
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
bien
!
<EOS>
Deux
ou
trois
cuillers
,
et
autant
de
fourchettes
en
argent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
the
result
was
a
handsome
case
,
containing
300
francs
worth
of
plate
.
  
<EOS>
The
programme
of
the
fête
-
day
's
proceedings
comprised
:
Presentation
of
plate
,
collation
in
the
garden
,
dramatic
performance
(
with
pupils
and
teachers
for
actors
)
,
a
dance
and
supper
.
<EOS>
Very
gorgeous
seemed
the
effect
of
the
whole
to
me
,
as
I
well
remember
.
<EOS>
Zélie
St.
Pierre
understood
these
things
and
managed
them
ably
.
  
<EOS>
The
play
was
the
main
point
;
a
month
's
previous
drilling
being
there
required
.
<EOS>
The
choice
,
too
,
of
the
actors
required
knowledge
and
care
;
then
came
lessons
in
elocution
,
in
attitude
,
and
then
the
fatigue
of
countless
rehearsals
.
<EOS>
For
all
this
,
as
may
well
be
supposed
,
St.
Pierre
did
not
suffice
:
other
management
,
other
accomplishments
than
hers
were
requisite
here
.
<EOS>
They
were
supplied
in
the
person
of
a
master
 
M.
Paul
Emanuel
,
professor
of
literature
.
<EOS>
It
was
never
my
lot
to
be
present
at
the
histrionic
lessons
of
M.
Paul
,
but
I
often
saw
him
as
he
crossed
the
_
carré
_
(
a
square
hall
between
the
dwelling
-
house
and
school
-
house
)
.
<EOS>
I
heard
him
,
too
,
in
the
warm
evenings
,
lecturing
with
open
doors
,
and
his
name
,
with
anecdotes
of
him
,
resounded
in
ones
ears
from
all
sides
.
<EOS>
Especially
our
former
acquaintance
,
Miss
Ginevra
Fanshawe
,
 
who
had
been
selected
to
take
a
prominent
part
in
the
play
 
used
,
in
bestowing
upon
me
a
large
portion
of
her
leisure
,
to
lard
her
discourse
with
frequent
allusions
to
his
sayings
and
doings
.
<EOS>
She
esteemed
him
hideously
plain
,
and
used
to
profess
herself
frightened
almost
into
hysterics
at
the
sound
of
his
step
or
voice
.
<EOS>
A
dark
little
man
he
certainly
was
;
pungent
and
austere
.
<EOS>
Even
to
me
he
seemed
a
harsh
apparition
,
with
his
close
-
shorn
,
black
head
,
his
broad
,
sallow
brow
,
his
thin
cheek
,
his
wide
and
quivering
nostril
,
his
thorough
glance
,
and
hurried
bearing
.
<EOS>
Irritable
he
was
;
one
heard
that
,
as
he
apostrophized
with
vehemence
the
awkward
squad
under
his
orders
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
would
break
out
on
these
raw
amateur
actresses
with
a
passion
of
impatience
at
their
falseness
of
conception
,
their
coldness
of
emotion
,
their
feebleness
of
delivery
.
<EOS>
"
Ecoutez
!
"
<EOS>
he
would
cry
;
and
then
his
voice
rang
through
the
premises
like
a
trumpet
;
and
when
,
mimicking
it
,
came
the
small
pipe
of
a
Ginevra
,
a
Mathilde
,
or
a
Blanche
,
one
understood
why
a
hollow
groan
of
scorn
,
or
a
fierce
hiss
of
rage
,
rewarded
the
tame
echo
.
  
<EOS>
"
Vous'n'êtes
<EOS>
donc
que
des
poupées
<EOS>
,
"
I
heard
him
thunder
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Vous
n'avez
pas
de
passions
 
vous
autres
.
<EOS>
Vous
ne
sentez
donc
rien
?
<EOS>
Votre
chair
est
de
neige
,
votre
sang
de
glace
!
<EOS>
Moi
,
je
veux
que
tout
cela
s'allume
,
qu'il
<EOS>
ait
une
vie
,
une
âme
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Vain
resolve
!
<EOS>
And
when
he
at
last
found
it
_
was
_
vain
,
he
suddenly
broke
the
whole
business
down
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
had
been
teaching
them
a
grand
tragedy
;
he
tore
the
tragedy
in
morsels
,
and
came
next
day
with
a
compact
little
comic
trifle
.
<EOS>
To
this
they
took
more
kindly
;
he
presently
knocked
it
all
into
their
smooth
round
pates
.
  
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
St.
Pierre
always
presided
at
M.
Emanuel
's
lessons
,
and
I
was
told
that
the
polish
of
her
manner
,
her
seeming
attention
,
her
tact
and
grace
,
impressed
that
gentleman
very
favourably
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
indeed
,
the
art
of
pleasing
,
for
a
given
time
,
whom
she
would
;
but
the
feeling
would
not
last
:
in
an
hour
it
was
dried
like
dew
,
vanished
like
gossamer
.
  
<EOS>
The
day
preceding
Madame
's
fête
was
as
much
a
holiday
as
the
fête
itself
.
<EOS>
It
was
devoted
to
clearing
out
,
cleaning
,
arranging
and
decorating
the
three
schoolrooms
.
<EOS>
All
within
-
doors
was
the
gayest
bustle
;
neither
up
-
stairs
nor
down
could
a
quiet
,
isolated
person
find
rest
for
the
sole
of
her
foot
;
accordingly
,
for
my
part
,
I
took
refuge
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
The
whole
day
did
I
wander
or
sit
there
alone
,
finding
warmth
in
the
sun
,
shelter
among
the
trees
,
and
a
sort
of
companionship
in
my
own
thoughts
.
<EOS>
I
well
remember
that
I
exchanged
but
two
sentences
that
day
with
any
living
being
:
not
that
I
felt
solitary
;
I
was
glad
to
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
For
a
looker
-
on
,
it
sufficed
to
pass
through
the
rooms
once
or
twice
,
observe
what
changes
were
being
wrought
,
how
a
green
-
room
and
a
dressing
-
room
were
being
contrived
,
a
little
stage
with
scenery
erected
,
how
M.
Paul
Emanuel
,
in
conjunction
with
Mademoiselle
St.
Pierre
,
was
directing
all
,
and
how
an
eager
band
of
pupils
,
amongst
them
Ginevra
Fanshawe
,
were
working
gaily
under
his
control
.
  
<EOS>
The
great
day
arrived
.
<EOS>
The
sun
rose
hot
and
unclouded
,
and
hot
and
unclouded
it
burned
on
till
evening
.
<EOS>
All
the
doors
and
all
the
windows
were
set
open
,
which
gave
a
pleasant
sense
of
summer
freedom
 
and
freedom
<EOS>
the
most
complete
seemed
indeed
the
order
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
Teachers
and
pupils
descended
to
breakfast
in
dressing
-
gowns
and
curl
-
papers
:
anticipating
"
avec
délices
"
the
toilette
of
the
evening
,
they
seemed
to
take
a
pleasure
in
indulging
that
forenoon
in
a
luxury
of
slovenliness
;
like
aldermen
fasting
in
preparation
for
a
feast
.
<EOS>
About
nine
o'clock
A.M.
,
an
important
functionary
,
the
"
coiffeur
,
"
arrived
.
<EOS>
Sacrilegious
to
state
,
he
fixed
his
head
-
quarters
in
the
oratory
,
and
there
,
in
presence
of
_
bénitier
_
,
candle
,
and
crucifix
,
solemnised
the
mysteries
of
his
art
.
<EOS>
Each
girl
was
summoned
in
turn
to
pass
through
his
hands
;
emerging
from
them
with
head
as
smooth
as
a
shell
,
intersected
by
faultless
white
lines
,
and
wreathed
about
with
Grecian
plaits
that
shone
as
if
lacquered
.
<EOS>
I
took
my
turn
with
the
rest
,
and
could
hardly
believe
what
the
glass
said
when
I
applied
to
it
for
information
afterwards
;
the
lavished
garlandry
of
woven
brown
hair
amazed
me
 
<EOS>
I
feared
it
was
not
all
my
own
,
and
it
required
several
convincing
pulls
to
give
assurance
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
I
then
acknowledged
in
the
coiffeur
a
first
-
rate
artist
 
one
who
certainly
made
the
most
of
indifferent
materials
.
  
<EOS>
The
oratory
closed
,
the
dormitory
became
the
scene
of
ablutions
,
arrayings
and
bedizenings
curiously
elaborate
.
<EOS>
To
me
it
was
,
and
ever
must
be
an
enigma
,
how
they
contrived
to
spend
so
much
time
in
doing
so
little
.
<EOS>
The
operation
seemed
close
,
intricate
,
prolonged
:
the
result
simple
.
<EOS>
A
clear
white
muslin
dress
,
a
blue
sash
(
the
Virgin
's
colours
)
,
a
pair
of
white
,
or
straw
-
colour
kid
gloves
 
such
was
the
gala
uniform
,
to
the
assumption
<EOS>
whereof
that
houseful
of
teachers
and
pupils
devoted
three
mortal
hours
.
<EOS>
But
though
simple
,
it
must
be
allowed
the
array
was
perfect
 
perfect
in
fashion
,
fit
,
and
freshness
;
every
head
being
also
dressed
with
exquisite
nicety
,
and
a
certain
compact
taste
 
suiting
the
full
,
firm
comeliness
of
Labassecourien
contours
,
though
too
stiff
for
any
more
flowing
and
flexible
style
of
beauty
 
<EOS>
the
general
effect
was
,
on
the
whole
,
commendable
.
  
<EOS>
In
beholding
this
diaphanous
and
snowy
mass
,
I
well
remember
feeling
myself
to
be
a
mere
shadowy
spot
on
a
field
of
light
;
the
courage
was
not
in
me
to
put
on
a
transparent
white
dress
:
something
thin
I
must
wear
 
the
weather
and
rooms
being
too
hot
to
give
substantial
fabrics
sufferance
,
so
I
had
sought
through
a
dozen
shops
till
I
lit
upon
a
crape
-
like
material
of
purple
-
gray
 
<EOS>
the
colour
,
in
short
,
of
dun
mist
,
lying
on
a
moor
in
bloom
.
<EOS>
My
_
tailleuse
_
had
kindly
made
it
as
well
as
she
could
:
because
,
as
she
judiciously
observed
,
it
was
"
si
<EOS>
triste
 
<EOS>
si
pen
voyant
,
"
care
in
the
fashion
was
the
more
imperative
:
it
was
well
<EOS>
she
took
this
view
of
the
matter
,
for
I
,
had
no
flower
,
no
jewel
to
relieve
it
:
<EOS>
and
,
what
was
more
,
I
had
no
natural
rose
of
complexion
.
  
<EOS>
We
become
oblivious
of
these
deficiencies
in
the
uniform
routine
of
daily
drudgery
,
but
they
_
will
_
force
upon
us
their
unwelcome
blank
on
those
bright
occasions
when
beauty
should
shine
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
in
this
same
gown
of
shadow
,
I
felt
at
home
and
at
ease
;
an
advantage
I
should
not
have
enjoyed
in
anything
more
brilliant
or
striking
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
,
too
,
kept
me
in
countenance
;
her
dress
was
almost
as
quiet
as
mine
,
except
that
she
wore
a
bracelet
,
and
a
large
brooch
bright
with
gold
and
fine
stones
.
<EOS>
We
chanced
to
meet
on
the
stairs
,
and
she
gave
me
a
nod
and
smile
of
approbation
.
<EOS>
Not
that
she
thought
I
was
looking
well
 
a
point
unlikely
to
engage
her
interest
 
<EOS>
but
she
considered
me
dressed
"
convenablement
,
"
"
décemment
,
"
and
la
Convenance
et
la
Décence
were
the
two
calm
deities
of
Madame
's
worship
.
<EOS>
She
even
paused
,
laid
on
my
shoulder
her
gloved
hand
,
holding
an
embroidered
and
perfumed
handkerchief
,
and
confided
to
my
ear
a
sarcasm
on
the
other
teachers
(
whom
she
had
just
been
complimenting
to
their
faces
)
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
so
absurd
,
"
she
said
,
"
as
for
des
femmes
mûres
"
to
dress
themselves
like
girls
of
fifteen
"

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Being
dressed
at
least
a
couple
of
hours
before
anybody
else
,
I
felt
a
pleasure
in
betaking
myself
 
not
to
the
garden
,
where
servants
were
busy
propping
up
long
tables
,
placing
seats
,
and
spreading
cloths
in
readiness
for
the
collation
but
to
the
schoolrooms
,
now
empty
,
quiet
,
cool
,
and
clean
;
their
walls
fresh
stained
,
their
planked
floors
fresh
scoured
and
scarce
dry
;
flowers
fresh
gathered
adorning
the
recesses
in
pots
,
and
draperies
,
fresh
hung
,
beautifying
the
great
windows
.
  
<EOS>
Withdrawing
to
the
first
classe
,
a
smaller
and
neater
room
than
the
others
,
and
taking
from
the
glazed
bookcase
,
of
which
I
kept
the
key
,
a
volume
whose
title
promised
some
interest
,
I
sat
down
to
read
.
<EOS>
The
glass
-
door
of
this
"
classe
,
"
or
schoolroom
,
opened
into
the
large
berceau
;
acacia
-
boughs
caressed
its
panes
,
as
they
stretched
across
to
meet
a
rose
-
bush
blooming
by
the
opposite
lintel
:
in
this
rose
-
bush
bees
murmured
busy
and
happy
.
<EOS>
I
commenced
reading
.
<EOS>
Just
as
the
stilly
hum
,
the
embowering
shade
,
the
warm
,
lonely
calm
of
my
retreat
were
beginning
to
steal
meaning
from
the
page
,
vision
from
my
eyes
,
and
to
lure
me
along
the
track
of
reverie
,
down
into
some
deep
dell
of
dreamland
 
just
then
,
the
sharpest
ring
of
the
street
-
door
bell
to
which
that
much
-
tried
instrument
had
ever
thrilled
,
snatched
me
back
to
consciousness
.
  
<EOS>
Now
the
bell
had
been
ringing
all
the
morning
,
as
workmen
,
or
servants
,
or
_
coiffeurs
_
,
or
_
tailleuses
_
,
went
and
came
on
their
several
errands
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
there
was
good
reason
to
expect
it
would
ring
all
the
afternoon
,
since
about
one
hundred
externes
were
yet
to
arrive
in
carriages
or
fiacres
:
nor
could
it
be
expected
to
rest
during
the
evening
,
when
parents
and
friends
would
gather
thronging
to
the
play
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
a
ring
 
even
a
sharp
ring
 
was
a
matter
of
course
:
yet
this
particular
peal
had
an
accent
of
its
own
,
which
chased
my
dream
,
and
startled
my
book
from
my
knee
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
stooping
to
pick
up
this
last
,
when
 
firm
,
fast
,
straight
 
right
on
through
vestibule
 
along
corridor
,
across
carré
,
through
first
division
,
second
division
,
grand
salle
 
<EOS>
strode
a
step
,
quick
,
regular
,
intent
.
<EOS>
The
closed
door
of
the
first
classe
 
<EOS>
my
sanctuary
 
offered
no
obstacle
;
it
burst
open
,
and
a
paletôt
and
a
bonnet
grec
filled
the
void
;
also
two
eyes
first
vaguely
struck
upon
,
and
then
hungrily
dived
into
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
C'est
cela
!
<EOS>
"
said
a
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Je
la
connais
:
<EOS>
c'est
l'Anglaise

<EOS>
Tant

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
,
with
a
certain
stern
politeness
(
I
suppose
he
thought
I
had
not
caught
the
drift
of
his
previous
uncivil
mutterings
)
,
and
in
a
jargon
the
most
execrable
that
ever
was
heard
,
"
Meess
 
,
play
you
must
:
I
am
planted
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
I
do
for
you
,
M.
Paul
Emanuel
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
:
for
M.
Paul
Emanuel
it
was
,
and
in
a
state
of
no
little
excitement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Play
you
must
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
have
you
shrink
,
or
frown
,
or
make
the
prude
.
<EOS>
I
read
your
skull
<EOS>
that
night
you
came
;
I
see
your
moyens
:
play
you
can
;
play
you
must
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
how
,
M.
Paul
?
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
time
to
be
lost
,
"
he
went
on
,
now
speaking
in
French
;
"
and
let
us
thrust
to
the
wall
all
reluctance
,
all
excuses
,
<EOS>
all
minauderies
.
<EOS>
You
must
take
a
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
In
the
vaudeville
?
"
  
"
In
the
vaudeville
.
<EOS>
You
have
said
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
gasped
,
horror
-
struck
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
What
_
did
the
little
man
mean
?
  
<EOS>
"
Listen
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
case
shall
be
stated
,
and
you
shall
then
answer
me
<EOS>
Yes
,
or
No
;
and
according
to
your
answer
shall
I
ever
after
estimate
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
scarce
-
suppressed
impetus
of
a
most
irritable
nature
glowed
in
his
cheek
,
fed
with
sharp
shafts
his
glances
,
a
nature
 
<EOS>
the
injudicious
,
the
mawkish
,
the
hesitating
,
the
sullen
,
the
affected
,
above
all
,
the
unyielding
,
might
quickly
render
violent
and
implacable
.
<EOS>
Silence
and
attention
was
the
best
balm
to
apply
:
I
listened
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
whole
matter
is
going
to
fail
,
"
he
began
.
"
<EOS>
Louise
Vanderkelkov
has
fallen
ill
 
at
least
so
her
ridiculous
mother
asserts
;
for
my
part
,
I
feel
sure
she
might
play
if
she
would
:
it
is
only
good
-
will
that
lacks
.
<EOS>
She
was
charged
with
a
_
<EOS>
rôle
_
,
as
you
know
,
or
do
_
<EOS>
not
_
know
 
<EOS>
it
is
equal
:
without
that
_
rôle
_
the
play
is
stopped
.
<EOS>
There
are
now
but
a
few
hours
in
which
to
learn
it
:
not
a
girl
in
this
school
would
hear
reason
,
and
accept
the
task
.
<EOS>
Forsooth
,
it
is
not
an
interesting
,
not
an
amiable
,
part
;
their
vile
_
amour
-
propre
_
 
<EOS>
that
base
quality
of
which
women
have
so
much
 
would
revolt
from
it
.
<EOS>
Englishwomen
are
either
the
best
or
the
worst
of
their
sex
.
<EOS>
Dieu
sait
que
je
<EOS>
les
déteste
<EOS>
comme
<EOS>
la
peste
,
ordinairement
"
(
this
between
his
recreant
teeth
)
.
<EOS>
"
I
apply
to
an
Englishwoman
to
rescue
me
.
<EOS>
What
is
her
answer
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
or
No
?
"
  
A
thousand
objections
rushed
into
my
mind
.
<EOS>
The
foreign
language
,
the
limited
time
,
the
public
display
...
<EOS>
Inclination
recoiled
,
Ability
faltered
,
Self
-
respect
(
that
"
vile
quality
"
)
trembled
.
<EOS>
"
Non
,
non
,
non
!
"
said
all
these
;
but
looking
up
at
M.
Paul
,
and
seeing
in
his
vexed
,
fiery
,
and
searching
eye
,
a
sort
of
appeal
behind
all
its
menace
,
my
lips
dropped
the
word
"
oui
"
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
his
rigid
countenance
relaxed
with
a
quiver
of
content
:
quickly
bent
up
again
,
however
,
he
went
on
,
    
<EOS>
"
Vite
à
l'ouvrage
!
<EOS>
Here
is
the
book
;
here
is
your
_
rôle
_
<EOS>
:
read
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
read
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
commend
;
at
some
passages
he
scowled
and
stamped
.
<EOS>
He
gave
me
a
lesson
:
I
diligently
imitated
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
disagreeable
part
 
<EOS>
a
man
's
 
an
empty
-
headed
fop
's
.
<EOS>
One
could
put
into
it
neither
heart
nor
soul
:
I
hated
it
.
<EOS>
The
play
 
a
mere
trifle
 
ran
chiefly
on
the
efforts
of
a
brace
of
rivals
to
gain
the
hand
of
a
fair
coquette
.
<EOS>
One
lover
was
called
the
"
Ours
,
"
a
good
and
gallant
but
unpolished
man
,
a
sort
of
diamond
in
the
rough
;
the
other
was
a
butterfly
,
a
talker
,
and
a
traitor
:
and
I
was
to
be
the
butterfly
,
talker
,
and
traitor
.
  
<EOS>
I
did
my
best
 
which
was
bad
,
I
know
:
it
provoked
M.
Paul
;
he
fumed
.
<EOS>
Putting
both
 
hands
to
the
work
,
I
endeavoured
to
do
better
than
my
best
;
I
presume
he
gave
me
credit
for
good
intentions
;
he
professed
to
be
partially
content
.
"
<EOS>
Ca
ira
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
;
and
as
voices
began
sounding
from
the
garden
,
and
white
dresses
fluttering
among
the
trees
,
he
added
:
"
You
must
withdraw
:
you
must
be
alone
to
learn
this
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Without
being
allowed
time
or
power
to
deliberate
,
I
found
myself
in
the
same
breath
convoyed
along
as
in
a
species
of
whirlwind
,
up
-
stairs
,
up
two
pair
of
stairs
,
nay
,
<EOS>
actually
up
three
(
for
this
fiery
little
man
seemed
as
by
instinct
to
know
his
way
everywhere
)
;
to
the
solitary
and
lofty
attic
was
I
borne
,
put
in
and
locked
in
,
the
key
being
,
in
the
door
,
and
that
key
he
took
with
him
and
vanished
.
  
<EOS>
The
attic
was
no
pleasant
place
<EOS>
:
I
believe
he
did
not
know
how
unpleasant
it
was
,
or
he
never
would
have
locked
me
in
with
so
little
ceremony
.
<EOS>
In
this
summer
weather
,
it
was
hot
as
Africa
;
as
in
winter
,
it
was
always
cold
as
Greenland
.
<EOS>
Boxes
and
lumber
filled
it
;
old
dresses
draped
its
unstained
wall
 
cobwebs
its
unswept
ceiling
.
<EOS>
Well
was
it
known
to
be
tenanted
by
rats
,
by
black
beetles
,
and
by
cockroaches
 
<EOS>
nay
,
rumour
affirmed
that
the
ghostly
Nun
of
the
garden
had
once
been
seen
here
.
<EOS>
A
partial
darkness
obscured
one
end
,
across
which
,
as
for
deeper
mystery
,
an
old
russet
curtain
was
drawn
,
by
way
of
screen
to
a
sombre
band
of
winter
cloaks
,
pendent
each
from
its
pin
,
like
a
malefactor
from
his
gibbet
.
<EOS>
From
amongst
these
cloaks
,
and
behind
that
curtain
,
the
Nun
was
said
to
issue
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
believe
this
,
nor
was
I
troubled
by
apprehension
thereof
;
but
I
saw
a
very
dark
and
large
rat
,
with
a
long
tail
,
come
gliding
out
from
that
squalid
alcove
;
and
,
moreover
,
my
eye
fell
on
many
a
black
-
beetle
,
dotting
the
floor
.
<EOS>
These
objects
discomposed
me
more
,
perhaps
,
than
it
would
be
wise
to
say
,
as
also
did
the
dust
,
lumber
,
and
stifling
heat
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
The
last
inconvenience
would
soon
have
become
intolerable
,
had
I
not
found
means
to
open
and
prop
up
the
skylight
,
thus
admitting
some
freshness
.
<EOS>
Underneath
this
aperture
I
pushed
a
large
empty
chest
,
and
having
mounted
upon
it
a
smaller
box
,
and
wiped
from
both
the
dust
,
I
gathered
my
dress
(
my
best
,
the
reader
must
remember
,
and
therefore
a
legitimate
object
of
care
)
fastidiously
around
me
,
ascended
this
species
of
extempore
throne
,
and
being
seated
,
commenced
the
acquisition
of
my
task
;
while
I
learned
,
not
forgetting
to
keep
a
sharp
look
-
out
on
the
black
-
beetles
and
cockroaches
,
of
which
,
more
even
,
I
believe
,
than
of
the
rats
,
I
sat
in
mortal
dread
.
  
<EOS>
My
impression
at
first
was
that
I
had
undertaken
what
it
really
was
impossible
to
perform
,
and
I
simply
resolved
to
do
my
best
and
be
resigned
to
fail
.
<EOS>
I
soon
found
,
however
,
that
one
part
in
so
short
a
piece
was
not
more
than
memory
could
master
at
a
few
hours
'
notice
.
<EOS>
I
learned
and
learned
on
,
first
in
a
whisper
,
and
then
aloud
.
<EOS>
Perfectly
secure
from
human
audience
,
I
acted
my
part
before
the
garret
-
vermin
.
<EOS>
Entering
into
its
emptiness
,
frivolity
,
and
falsehood
,
with
a
spirit
inspired
by
scorn
and
impatience
,
I
took
my
revenge
on
this
"
fat
,
"
by
making
him
as
fatuitous
as
I
possibly
could
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
exercise
the
afternoon
passed
:
day
began
to
glide
into
evening
;
and
I
,
who
had
eaten
nothing
since
breakfast
,
grew
excessively
hungry
.
<EOS>
Now
I
thought
of
the
collation
,
which
doubtless
they
were
just
then
devouring
in
the
garden
far
below
.
<EOS>
(
I
had
seen
in
the
vestibule
a
basketful
of
small
_
pâtés
à
la
crême
<EOS>
_
,
than
which
nothing
in
the
whole
range
of
cookery
seemed
to
me
better
)
.
<EOS>
A
_
pâté
_
,
or
a
square
of
cake
<EOS>
,
it
seemed
to
me
would
come
very
_
àpropos
;
_
<EOS>
and
as
my
relish
for
those
dainties
increased
,
it
began
to
appear
somewhat
hard
that
I
should
pass
my
holiday
,
fasting
and
in
prison
.
<EOS>
Remote
as
was
the
attic
from
the
street
-
door
and
vestibule
,
yet
the
ever
-
tinkling
bell
was
faintly
audible
here
;
and
also
the
ceaseless
roll
of
wheels
,
on
the
tormented
pavement
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
the
house
and
garden
were
thronged
,
and
that
all
was
gay
and
glad
below
;
here
it
began
to
grow
dusk
:
the
beetles
were
fading
from
my
sight
;
I
trembled
lest
they
should
steal
on
me
a
march
,
mount
my
throne
unseen
,
and
,
unsuspected
,
invade
my
skirts
.
<EOS>
Impatient
and
apprehensive
<EOS>
,
I
recommenced
the
rehearsal
of
my
part
merely
to
kill
time
.
<EOS>
Just
as
I
was
concluding
,
the
long
-
delayed
rattle
of
the
key
in
the
lock
came
to
my
ear
 
no
unwelcome
sound
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
<EOS>
(
I
could
just
see
through
the
dusk
that
it
_
was
_
M.
Paul
,
for
light
enough
still
lingered
to
show
the
velvet
blackness
of
his
close
-
shorn
head
,
and
the
sallow
ivory
of
his
brow
)
looked
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Brava
!
"
<EOS>
cried
he
,
holding
the
door
open
and
remaining
at
the
threshold
.
"
<EOS>
J'ai
tout
entendu
.
<EOS>
C'est
assez
bien
.
<EOS>
Encore
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
moment
I
hesitated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Encore
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Et
point
de
grimaces
!
<EOS>
A
bas
la
timidité
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Again
I
went
through
the
part
,
but
not
half
so
well
as
I
had
spoken
it
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Enfin
,
elle
sait
,
"
said
he
,
half
dissatisfied
,
"
and
one
can
not
be
fastidious
or
exacting
under
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
added
,
"
You
may
yet
have
twenty
minutes
for
preparation
:
au
revoir
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
was
going
.
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
"
I
called
out
,
taking
courage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
bien
!
<EOS>
Qu'est
-
ce
que
c'est
,
Mademoiselle
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
J'ai
bien
faim
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Comment
,
vous
avez
faim
!
<EOS>
Et
la
collation
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
it
,
shut
up
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
C'est
vrai
,
"
cried
he
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
moment
my
throne
was
abdicated
,
the
attic
evacuated
;
an
inverse
repetition
of
the
impetus
which
had
brought
me
up
into
the
attic
,
instantly
took
me
down
 
down
 
down
to
the
very
kitchen
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
should
have
gone
to
the
cellar
.
<EOS>
The
cook
was
imperatively
ordered
to
produce
food
,
and
I
,
as
imperatively
,
was
commanded
to
eat
.
<EOS>
To
my
great
joy
this
food
was
limited
to
coffee
and
cake
:
I
had
feared
wine
and
sweets
,
which
I
did
not
like
.
<EOS>
How
he
guessed
that
I
should
like
a
_
petit
pâté
<EOS>
à
la
crême
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
;
but
he
went
out
and
procured
me
one
from
some
quarter
.
<EOS>
With
considerable
willingness
I
ate
and
drank
,
keeping
the
_
petit
pâté
_
till
the
last
,
as
a
_
bonne
bouche
_
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
superintended
my
repast
,
and
almost
forced
upon
me
more
than
I
could
swallow
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
la
bonne
heure
,
"
he
cried
,
when
I
signified
that
I
really
could
take
no
more
,
and
,
with
uplifted
hands
,
implored
to
be
spared
the
additional
roll
on
which
he
had
just
spread
butter
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
set
me
down
as
a
species
of
tyrant
and
Bluebeard
,
starving
women
in
a
garret
;
whereas
,
after
all
,
I
am
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Mademoiselle
,
do
you
feel
courage
and
strength
to
appear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
thought
I
did
;
though
,
in
truth
,
I
was
perfectly
confused
,
and
could
hardly
tell
how
I
felt
:
but
this
little
man
was
of
the
order
of
beings
who
must
not
be
opposed
,
unless
you
possessed
an
all
-
dominant
force
sufficient
to
crush
him
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
then
,
"
said
he
,
offering
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
I
gave
him
mine
,
and
he
set
off
with
a
rapid
walk
,
which
obliged
me
to
run
at
his
side
in
order
to
keep
pace
.
<EOS>
In
the
carré
he
stopped
a
moment
:
it
was
lit
with
large
lamps
;
the
wide
doors
of
the
classes
were
open
,
and
so
were
the
equally
wide
garden
-
doors
;
orange
-
trees
in
tubs
,
and
tall
flowers
in
pots
,
ornamented
these
portals
on
each
side
;
groups
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
evening
-
dress
stood
and
walked
amongst
the
flowers
.
<EOS>
Within
,
the
long
vista
of
the
school
-
rooms
presented
a
thronging
,
undulating
,
murmuring
,
waving
,
streaming
multitude
,
all
rose
,
and
blue
,
and
half
translucent
white
.
<EOS>
There
were
lustres
burning
overhead
;
far
off
there
was
a
stage
,
a
solemn
green
curtain
,
a
row
of
footlights
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nest
-
ce
pas
que
c'est
beau
?
"
demanded
my
companion
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
said
it
was
,
but
my
heart
got
up
into
my
throat
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
discovered
this
,
and
gave
me
a
side
-
scowl
and
a
little
shake
for
my
pains
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
my
best
,
but
I
wish
it
was
over
,
"
said
I
<EOS>
;
then
I
asked
:
"
Are
we
to
walk
through
that
crowd
?
"
  
"
By
no
means
:
I
manage
matters
better
:
we
pass
through
the
garden
 
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
an
instant
we
were
out
of
doors
:
the
cool
,
calm
night
revived
me
somewhat
.
<EOS>
It
was
moonless
,
but
the
reflex
from
the
many
glowing
windows
lit
the
court
brightly
,
and
even
the
alleys
 
dimly
.
<EOS>
Heaven
was
cloudless
,
and
grand
with
the
quiver
of
its
living
fires
.
<EOS>
How
soft
are
the
nights
of
the
Continent
!
<EOS>
How
bland
,
balmy
,
safe
!
<EOS>
No
sea
-
fog
;
no
chilling
damp
:
mistless
as
noon
,
and
fresh
as
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Having
crossed
court
and
garden
,
we
reached
the
glass
door
of
the
first
classe
.
<EOS>
It
stood
open
,
like
all
other
doors
that
night
;
we
passed
,
and
then
I
was
ushered
into
a
small
cabinet
,
dividing
the
first
classe
from
the
grand
salle
.
<EOS>
This
cabinet
dazzled
me
,
it
was
so
full
of
light
<EOS>
:
it
deafened
me
,
it
was
clamorous
with
voices
<EOS>
:
it
stifled
me
,
it
was
so
hot
,
choking
,
thronged
.
  
<EOS>
"
De
l'ordre
!
<EOS>
Du
silence
!
"
cried
M.
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
Is
this
chaos
?
"
,
he
demanded
;
and
there
was
a
hush
.
<EOS>
With
a
dozen
words
,
and
as
many
gestures
,
he
turned
out
half
the
persons
present
,
and
obliged
the
remnant
to
fall
into
rank
.
<EOS>
Those
left
were
all
in
costume
:
they
were
the
performers
,
and
this
was
the
green
-
room
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
introduced
me
.
<EOS>
All
stared
and
some
tittered
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
surprise
:
they
had
not
expected
the
Englishwoman
would
play
in
a
_
vaudeville
_
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
Fanshawe
,
beautifully
dressed
for
her
part
,
and
looking
fascinatingly
pretty
,
turned
on
me
a
pair
of
eyes
as
round
as
beads
.
<EOS>
In
the
highest
spirit
,
unperturbed
by
fear
or
bashfulness
,
delighted
indeed
at
the
thought
of
shining
off
before
hundreds
 
<EOS>
my
entrance
seemed
to
transfix
her
with
amazement
in
the
midst
of
her
joy
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
exclaimed
,
but
M.
Paul
held
her
and
all
the
rest
in
check
.
  
<EOS>
Having
surveyed
and
criticized
the
whole
troop
,
he
turned
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
too
,
must
be
dressed
for
your
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dressed
 
<EOS>
dressed
like
a
man
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Zélie
St.
Pierre
,
darting
forwards
;
adding
with
officiousness
,
"
I
will
dress
her
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
To
be
dressed
like
a
man
did
not
please
,
and
would
not
suit
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
consented
to
take
a
man
's
name
and
part
;
as
to
his
dress
 
_
halte
là
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
would
keep
my
own
dress
,
come
what
might
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
might
storm
,
might
rage
:
I
would
keep
my
own
dress
.
<EOS>
I
said
so
,
with
a
voice
as
resolute
in
intent
,
as
it
was
low
,
and
perhaps
unsteady
in
utterance
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
immediately
storm
or
rage
,
as
I
fully
thought
he
would
he
stood
silent
.
<EOS>
But
Zélie
again
interposed
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
make
a
capital
_
petit
-
mâitre
_
.
<EOS>
Here
are
the
garments
,
all
 
all
complete
:
somewhat
too
large
,
but
 
I
will
arrange
all
that
.
<EOS>
Come
,
chère
amie
 
belle
Anglaise
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
she
sneered
,
for
I
was
not
"
belle
.
"
<EOS>
She
seized
my
hand
,
she
was
drawing
me
away
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
stood
impassable
 
neutral
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
resist
,
"
pursued
St.
Pierre
 
for
resist
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
spoil
all
,
destroy
the
mirth
of
the
piece
,
the
enjoyment
of
the
company
,
sacrifice
everything
to
your
_
amour
-
propre
_
.
<EOS>
This
would
be
too
bad
 
<EOS>
monsieur
will
never
permit
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
sought
his
eye
.
<EOS>
I
watched
,
likewise
,
for
a
glance
.
<EOS>
He
gave
her
one
,
and
then
he
gave
me
one
.
"
<EOS>
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
slowly
,
arresting
St.
Pierre
,
who
continued
her
efforts
to
drag
me
after
her
.
<EOS>
Everybody
awaited
the
decision
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
angry
,
not
irritated
;
I
perceived
that
,
and
took
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
like
these
clothes
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
,
pointing
to
the
masculine
vestments
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
object
to
some
of
them
,
but
I
wo
n't
have
them
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
must
it
be
,
then
?
<EOS>
How
accept
a
man
's
part
,
and
go
on
the
stage
dressed
as
a
woman
?
<EOS>
This
is
an
amateur
affair
,
it
is
true
 
a
_
vaudeville
de
pensionnat
;
_
certain
modifications
<EOS>
I
might
sanction
,
yet
something
you
must
have
to
announce
you
as
of
the
nobler
sex
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
I
will
,
Monsieur
;
but
it
must
be
arranged
in
my
own
way
:
nobody
must
meddle
;
the
things
must
not
be
forced
upon
me
.
<EOS>
Just
let
me
dress
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Monsieur
,
without
another
word
,
took
the
costume
from
St.
Pierre
,
gave
it
to
me
,
and
permitted
me
to
pass
into
the
dressing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Once
alone
,
I
grew
calm
,
and
collectedly
went
to
work
.
<EOS>
Retaining
my
woman
's
garb
without
the
slightest
retrenchment
,
I
merely
assumed
,
in
addition
,
a
little
vest
,
a
collar
,
and
cravat
,
and
a
paletôt
of
small
dimensions
;
the
whole
being
the
costume
of
a
brother
of
one
of
the
pupils
.
<EOS>
Having
loosened
my
hair
out
of
its
braids
,
made
up
the
long
back
-
hair
close
,
and
brushed
the
front
hair
to
one
side
,
I
took
my
hat
and
gloves
in
my
hand
and
came
out
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
was
waiting
,
and
so
were
the
others
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
That
may
pass
in
a
pensionnat
,
"
he
pronounced
.
<EOS>
Then
added
,
not
unkindly
,
"
Courage
,
mon
ami
!
<EOS>
Un
peu
<EOS>
de
sangfroid
 
<EOS>
un
peu
d'aplomb
,
M.
Lucien
,
et
tout
ira
bien
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
St.
Pierre
sneered
again
,
in
her
cold
snaky
manner
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
irritable
,
because
excited
,
and
I
could
not
help
turning
upon
her
and
saying
,
that
if
she
were
not
a
lady
and
I
a
gentleman
,
I
should
feel
disposed
to
call
her
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
the
play
,
after
the
play
,
"
said
M.
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
then
divide
my
pair
of
pistols
between
you
,
and
we
will
settle
the
dispute
according
to
form
:
it
will
only
be
the
old
quarrel
of
France
and
England
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
now
the
moment
approached
for
the
performance
to
commence
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
,
setting
us
before
him
,
harangued
us
briefly
,
like
a
general
addressing
soldiers
about
to
charge
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
he
said
,
except
that
he
recommended
each
to
penetrate
herself
with
a
sense
of
her
personal
insignificance
.
<EOS>
God
knows
I
thought
this
advice
superfluous
for
some
of
us
.
<EOS>
A
bell
tinkled
.
<EOS>
I
and
two
more
were
ushered
on
to
the
stage
.
<EOS>
The
bell
tinkled
again
.
<EOS>
I
had
to
speak
the
very
first
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
look
at
the
crowd
,
nor
think
of
it
,
"
whispered
M.
Paul
in
my
ear
.
"
<EOS>
Imagine
yourself
in
the
garret
,
acting
to
the
rats
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
vanished
.
<EOS>
The
curtain
drew
up
 
shrivelled
to
the
ceiling
:
the
bright
lights
,
the
long
room
,
the
gay
throng
,
burst
upon
us
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
the
black
-
beetles
,
the
old
boxes
,
the
worm
-
eaten
bureau
.
<EOS>
I
said
my
say
badly
;
but
I
said
it
.
<EOS>
That
first
speech
was
the
difficulty
;
it
revealed
to
me
this
fact
,
that
it
was
not
the
crowd
I
feared
so
much
as
my
own
voice
.
<EOS>
Foreigners
and
strangers
,
the
crowd
were
nothing
to
me
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
I
think
of
them
.
<EOS>
When
my
tongue
once
got
free
,
and
my
voice
took
its
true
pitch
,
and
found
its
natural
tone
,
I
thought
of
nothing
but
the
personage
I
represented
 
and
of
M.
Paul
,
who
was
listening
,
watching
,
prompting
in
the
side
-
scenes
.
  
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
,
feeling
the
right
power
<EOS>
come
 
the
spring
demanded
gush
and
rise
inwardly
 
<EOS>
I
became
sufficiently
composed
to
notice
my
fellow
-
actors
.
<EOS>
Some
of
them
played
very
well
;
especially
Ginevra
Fanshawe
,
who
had
to
coquette
between
two
suitors
,
and
managed
admirably
:
in
fact
she
was
in
her
element
.
<EOS>
I
observed
that
she
once
or
twice
threw
a
certain
marked
fondness
and
pointed
partiality
into
her
manner
towards
me
 
the
fop
.
<EOS>
With
such
emphasis
and
animation
did
she
favour
me
,
such
glances
did
she
dart
out
into
the
listening
and
applauding
crowd
,
that
to
me
 
who
knew
her
 
it
presently
became
evident
she
was
acting
_
at
_
some
one
;
and
I
followed
her
eye
,
her
smile
,
her
gesture
,
and
ere
long
discovered
that
she
had
at
least
singled
out
a
handsome
and
distinguished
aim
for
her
shafts
;
full
in
the
path
of
those
arrows
 
taller
than
other
spectators
,
and
therefore
more
sure
to
receive
them
 
stood
,
in
attitude
quiet
but
intent
,
a
well
-
known
form
 
that
of
Dr.
John
.
  
<EOS>
The
spectacle
seemed
somehow
suggestive
.
<EOS>
There
was
language
in
Dr.
John
's
look
,
though
I
can
not
tell
what
he
said
;
it
animated
me
:
<EOS>
I
drew
out
of
it
a
history
;
I
put
my
idea
into
the
part
I
per
formed
;
I
threw
it
into
my
wooing
of
Ginevra
.
<EOS>
In
the
"
Ours
,
"
or
sincere
lover
,
I
saw
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
Did
I
pity
him
,
as
erst
?
<EOS>
No
,
I
hardened
my
heart
,
rivalled
and
out
-
rivalled
him
.
<EOS>
I
knew
myself
but
a
fop
,
but
where
_
he
_
was
outcast
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
could
please
.
<EOS>
Now
I
know
acted
as
if
wishful
and
resolute
to
win
and
conquer
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
seconded
me
;
between
us
we
half
-
changed
the
nature
of
the
_
rôle
_
,
gilding
it
from
top
to
toe
.
<EOS>
Between
the
acts
M.
Paul
,
told
us
he
knew
not
what
possessed
us
,
and
half
expostulated
.
"
<EOS>
C'est
peut
-
être
plus
beau
que
votre
modèle
,
"
said
he
,
"
<EOS>
mais
ce
n'est
pas
juste
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
what
possessed
me
either
;
but
somehow
,
my
longing
was
to
eclipse
the
"
Ours
,
"
_
<EOS>
i.e.
_
,
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
was
tender
;
how
could
I
be
otherwise
than
chivalric
?
<EOS>
Retaining
the
letter
,
I
recklessly
altered
the
spirit
of
the
_
rôle
_
.
<EOS>
Without
heart
,
without
interest
,
I
could
not
play
it
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
played
 
in
<EOS>
went
the
yearned
-
for
seasoning
 
thus
favoured
<EOS>
,
I
played
it
with
relish
.
  
<EOS>
What
I
felt
that
night
,
and
what
I
did
,
I
no
more
expected
to
feel
and
do
,
than
to
be
lifted
in
a
trance
to
the
seventh
heaven
.
<EOS>
Cold
,
reluctant
,
apprehensive
,
I
had
accepted
a
part
to
please
another
:
<EOS>
ere
long
,
warming
,
becoming
interested
,
taking
courage
,
I
acted
to
please
myself
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
next
day
,
when
I
thought
it
over
,
I
quite
disapproved
of
these
amateur
performances
;
and
though
glad
that
I
had
obliged
M.
Paul
,
and
tried
my
own
strength
for
once
,
I
took
a
firm
resolution
,
never
to
be
drawn
into
a
similar
affair
.
<EOS>
A
keen
relish
for
dramatic
expression
had
revealed
itself
as
part
of
my
nature
;
to
cherish
and
exercise
this
new
-
found
faculty
might
gift
me
with
a
world
of
delight
,
but
it
would
not
do
for
a
mere
looker
-
on
at
life
:
<EOS>
the
strength
and
longing
must
be
put
by
;
and
I
put
them
by
,
and
fastened
them
in
with
the
lock
of
a
resolution
which
neither
Time
nor
Temptation
has
since
picked
.
  
<EOS>
No
sooner
was
the
play
over
,
and
_
<EOS>
well
_
over
,
<EOS>
than
the
choleric
and
arbitrary
M.
Paul
underwent
a
metamorphosis
.
<EOS>
His
hour
of
managerial
responsibility
past
,
he
at
once
laid
aside
his
magisterial
austerity
;
in
a
moment
he
stood
amongst
us
,
vivacious
,
kind
,
and
social
,
shook
hands
with
us
all
round
,
thanked
us
separately
,
and
announced
his
determination
that
each
of
us
should
in
turn
be
his
partner
in
the
coming
ball
.
<EOS>
On
his
claiming
my
promise
,
I
told
him
I
did
not
dance
.
"
<EOS>
For
once
I
must
,
"
was
the
answer
;
and
if
I
had
not
slipped
aside
and
kept
out
of
his
way
,
he
would
have
compelled
me
to
this
second
performance
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
acted
enough
for
one
evening
;
it
was
time
I
retired
into
myself
and
my
ordinary
life
.
<EOS>
My
dun
-
coloured
dress
did
well
enough
under
a
paletôt
on
the
stage
,
but
would
not
suit
a
waltz
or
a
quadrille
.
<EOS>
Withdrawing
to
a
quiet
nook
,
whence
unobserved
I
could
observe
 
the
ball
,
its
splendours
and
its
pleasures
,
passed
before
me
as
a
spectacle
.
  
<EOS>
Again
Ginevra
Fanshawe
was
the
belle
,
the
fairest
and
the
gayest
present
;
she
was
selected
to
open
the
ball
:
<EOS>
very
lovely
she
looked
,
very
gracefully
she
danced
,
<EOS>
very
joyously
she
smiled
.
<EOS>
Such
scenes
were
her
triumphs
 
<EOS>
she
was
the
child
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Work
or
suffering
found
her
listless
and
dejected
,
powerless
and
repining
;
but
gaiety
expanded
her
butterfly
's
wings
,
lit
up
their
gold
-
dust
and
bright
spots
,
made
her
flash
like
a
gem
,
and
flush
like
a
flower
.
<EOS>
At
all
ordinary
diet
and
plain
beverage
she
would
pout
;
but
she
fed
on
creams
and
ices
like
a
humming
-
bird
on
honey
-
paste
:
sweet
wine
was
her
element
,
and
sweet
cake
her
daily
bread
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
lived
her
full
life
in
a
ball
-
room
;
elsewhere
she
drooped
dispirited
.
  
<EOS>
Think
not
,
reader
,
that
she
thus
bloomed
and
sparkled
for
the
mere
sake
of
M.
Paul
,
her
partner
,
or
that
she
lavished
her
best
graces
that
night
for
the
edification
of
her
companions
only
,
or
for
that
of
the
parents
and
grand
-
parents
,
who
filled
the
carré
,
and
lined
the
ball
-
room
;
under
circumstances
so
insipid
and
limited
,
with
motives
so
chilly
and
vapid
,
Ginevra
would
scarce
have
deigned
to
walk
one
quadrille
,
and
weariness
and
fretfulness
would
have
replaced
animation
and
good
-
humour
,
but
she
knew
of
a
leaven
in
the
otherwise
heavy
festal
mass
which
lighted
the
whole
;
she
tasted
a
condiment
which
gave
it
zest
;
she
perceived
reasons
justifying
the
display
of
her
choicest
attractions
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
ball
-
room
,
indeed
,
not
a
single
male
spectator
was
to
be
seen
who
was
not
married
and
a
father
 
M.
Paul
excepted
 
that
gentleman
,
too
,
being
the
sole
creature
of
his
sex
permitted
to
lead
out
a
pupil
to
the
dance
;
and
this
exceptional
part
was
allowed
him
,
partly
as
a
matter
of
old
-
established
custom
<EOS>
(
for
he
was
a
kinsman
of
Madame
Beck
's
,
and
high
in
her
confidence
)
,
partly
because
he
would
always
have
his
own
way
and
do
as
he
pleased
,
and
partly
because
 
wilful
,
passionate
,
partial
,
as
he
might
be
 
he
was
the
soul
of
honour
,
and
might
be
trusted
with
a
regiment
of
the
fairest
and
purest
;
in
perfect
security
that
under
his
leadership
they
would
come
to
no
harm
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
girls
 
<EOS>
it
may
be
noted
in
parenthesis
 
were
not
pure
-
minded
at
all
,
very
much
otherwise
;
but
they
no
more
dare
betray
their
natural
coarseness
in
M.
Paul
's
presence
,
than
they
dare
tread
purposely
on
his
corns
,
laugh
in
his
face
during
a
stormy
apostrophe
,
or
speak
above
their
breath
while
some
crisis
of
irritability
was
covering
his
human
visage
with
the
mask
of
an
intelligent
tiger
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
,
then
,
might
dance
with
whom
he
would
 
and
woe
be
to
the
interference
which
put
him
out
of
step
.
  
<EOS>
Others
there
were
admitted
as
spectators
 
with
(
seeming
)
reluctance
,
through
prayers
,
by
influence
,
under
restriction
,
by
special
and
difficult
exercise
of
Madame
Beck
's
gracious
good
-
nature
,
and
whom
she
all
the
evening
 
with
her
own
personal
surveillance
 
kept
far
aloof
at
the
remotest
,
drearest
,
coldest
,
darkest
side
of
the
carré
 
<EOS>
a
small
,
forlorn
band
of
"
jeunes
gens
;
"
these
being
all
of
the
best
families
,
grown
-
up
sons
of
mothers
present
,
and
whose
sisters
were
pupils
in
the
school
.
<EOS>
That
whole
evening
was
Madame
on
duty
beside
these
"
jeunes
gens
"
 
attentive
to
them
as
a
mother
,
but
strict
with
them
as
a
dragon
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
sort
of
cordon
stretched
before
them
,
which
they
wearied
her
with
prayers
to
be
permitted
to
pass
,
and
just
to
revive
themselves
by
one
dance
with
that
"
belle
blonde
,
"
or
that
"
jolie
brune
,
"
or
"
cette
jeune
fille
magnifique
aux
cheveux
noirs
comme
le
jais
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Taisez
-
vous
!
"
<EOS>
Madame
would
reply
,
heroically
and
inexorably
.
"
<EOS>
Vous
ne
passerez
pas
<EOS>
à
moins
que
ce
ne
soit
sur
mon
cadavre
,
et
vous
ne
danserez
qu'avec
<EOS>
la
nonnette
du
jardin
"
<EOS>
(
alluding
to
the
legend
)
.
<EOS>
And
she
majestically
walked
to
and
fro
along
their
disconsolate
and
impatient
line
,
like
a
little
Bonaparte
in
a
mouse
-
coloured
silk
gown
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
knew
something
of
the
world
;
Madame
knew
much
of
human
nature
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
that
another
directress
in
Villette
would
have
dared
to
admit
a
"
jeune
homme
"
within
her
walls
;
but
Madame
knew
that
by
granting
such
admission
,
on
an
occasion
like
the
present
,
a
bold
stroke
might
be
struck
,
and
a
great
point
gained
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
the
parents
were
made
accomplices
to
the
deed
,
for
it
was
only
through
their
mediation
it
was
brought
about
.
<EOS>
Secondly
:
the
admission
of
these
rattlesnakes
,
so
fascinating
and
so
dangerous
,
served
to
draw
out
Madame
precisely
in
her
strongest
character
 
that
of
a
first
-
rate
_
surveillante
_
.
<EOS>
Thirdly
:
their
presence
furnished
a
most
piquant
ingredient
to
the
entertainment
:
the
pupils
knew
it
,
and
saw
it
,
and
the
view
of
such
golden
apples
shining
afar
off
,
animated
them
with
a
spirit
no
other
circumstance
could
have
kindled
.
<EOS>
The
children
's
pleasure
spread
to
the
parents
;
life
and
mirth
circulated
quickly
round
the
ball
-
room
;
the
"
jeunes
gens
"
themselves
,
though
restrained
,
were
amused
:
for
Madame
never
permitted
them
to
feel
dull
 
and
thus
Madame
Beck
's
fête
annually
ensured
a
success
unknown
to
the
fête
of
any
other
directress
in
the
land
.
  
<EOS>
I
observed
that
Dr.
John
was
at
first
permitted
to
walk
at
large
through
the
classes
:
there
was
about
him
a
manly
,
responsible
look
,
that
redeemed
his
youth
,
and
half
-
expiated
his
beauty
;
but
as
soon
as
the
ball
began
,
Madame
ran
up
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Wolf
;
come
,
"
said
she
,
laughing
:
"
you
wear
sheep
's
clothing
,
but
you
must
quit
the
fold
notwithstanding
.
<EOS>
Come
;
I
have
a
fine
menagerie
of
twenty
here
in
the
carré
:
let
me
place
you
amongst
my
collection

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
first
suffer
me
to
have
one
dance
with
one
pupil
of
my
choice
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
the
face
to
ask
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
It
is
madness
:
it
is
impiety
.
<EOS>
Sortez

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
drove
him
before
her
,
and
soon
had
him
enclosed
within
the
cordon
.
  
<EOS>
Ginevra
being
,
I
suppose
,
tired
with
dancing
,
sought
me
out
in
my
retreat
.
<EOS>
She
threw
herself
on
the
bench
beside
me
,
and
(
a
demonstration
I
could
very
well
have
dispensed
with
)
<EOS>
cast
her
arms
round
my
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
Snowe
!
<EOS>
Lucy
Snowe
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cried
in
a
somewhat
sobbing
voice
,
half
hysterical
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
in
the
world
is
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
I
drily
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
I
look
 
<EOS>
how
do
I
look
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
she
demanded
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
usual
,
"
said
I
;
"
preposterously
vain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Caustic
creature
!
<EOS>
You
never
have
a
kind
word
for
me
;
but
in
spite
of
you
,
and
all
other
envious
detractors
<EOS>
,
I
know
I
am
beautiful
;
I
feel
it
<EOS>
,
I
see
it
 
for
there
is
a
great
looking
-
glass
in
the
dressing
-
room
,
where
I
can
view
my
shape
from
head
to
foot
.
<EOS>
Will
you
go
with
me
now
,
and
let
us
two
stand
before
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
Miss
Fanshawe
:
you
shall
be
humoured
even
to
the
top
of
your
bent
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
dressing
-
room
was
very
near
,
and
we
stepped
in
.
<EOS>
Putting
her
arm
through
mine
,
she
drew
me
to
the
mirror
.
<EOS>
Without
resistance
remonstrance
,
or
remark
,
I
stood
and
let
her
self
-
love
have
its
feast
and
triumph
:
curious
to
see
how
much
it
could
swallow
 
whether
it
was
possible
<EOS>
it
could
feed
to
satiety
 
whether
any
whisper
of
consideration
for
others
could
penetrate
her
heart
,
and
moderate
its
vainglorious
exultation
.
  
<EOS>
Not
at
all
.
<EOS>
She
turned
me
and
herself
round
;
she
viewed
us
both
on
all
sides
;
she
smiled
,
she
waved
her
curls
<EOS>
,
she
retouched
her
sash
,
she
spread
her
dress
,
and
finally
,
letting
go
my
arm
,
and
curtseying
with
mock
respect
<EOS>
,
she
said
:
"
I
would
not
be
you
for
a
kingdom
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
remark
was
too
_
naïve
<EOS>
_
to
rouse
anger
<EOS>
;
I
merely
said
:
"
Very
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
would
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
give
to
be
ME
?
<EOS>
"
she
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bad
sixpence
 
strange
as
it
may
sound
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
but
a
poor
creature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
think
so
in
your
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
for
in
my
heart
you
have
not
the
outline
of
a
place
:
I
only
occasionally
turn
you
over
in
my
brain
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
"
said
she
,
in
an
expostulatory
tone
,
"
just
listen
to
the
difference
of
our
positions
,
and
then
see
how
happy
am
I
,
and
how
miserable
are
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
on
;
I
listen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
first
place
:
I
am
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
of
family
,
and
though
my
father
is
not
rich
,
I
have
expectations
from
an
uncle
.
<EOS>
Then
,
I
am
just
eighteen
,
the
finest
age
possible
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
a
continental
education
,
and
though
I
ca
n't
spell
,
I
have
abundant
accomplishments
.
<EOS>
I
_
am
_
pretty
;
<EOS>
_
you
_
ca
n't
deny
that
;
I
may
have
as
many
admirers
as
I
choose
.
<EOS>
This
very
night
I
have
been
breaking
the
hearts
of
two
gentlemen
,
and
it
is
the
dying
look
I
had
from
one
of
them
just
now
,
which
puts
me
in
such
spirits
.
<EOS>
I
do
so
like
to
watch
them
turn
red
and
pale
,
and
scowl
and
dart
fiery
glances
at
each
other
,
and
languishing
ones
at
me
.
<EOS>
There
is
_
me
_
 
happy
ME
;
now
for
_
you
_
,
poor
soul
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
are
nobody
's
daughter
,
since
you
took
care
of
little
children
when
you
first
came
to
Villette
:
you
have
no
relations
;
you
ca
n't
call
yourself
young
at
twenty
-
three
;
you
have
no
attractive
accomplishments
 
no
beauty
.
<EOS>
As
to
admirers
,
you
hardly
know
what
they
are
;
you
ca
n't
even
talk
on
the
subject
<EOS>
:
you
sit
dumb
when
the
other
teachers
quote
their
conquests
.
<EOS>
I
believe
you
never
were
in
love
,
and
never
will
be
:
you
do
n't
know
the
feeling
,
and
so
much
the
better
,
for
though
you
might
have
your
own
heart
broken
,
no
living
heart
will
you
ever
break
.
<EOS>
Is
n't
it
all
true
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
good
deal
of
it
is
true
as
gospel
,
and
shrewd
besides
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
good
in
you
,
Ginevra
,
to
speak
so
honestly
;
that
snake
,
Zélie
St.
Pierre
,
could
not
utter
what
you
have
uttered
.
<EOS>
Still
,
Miss
Fanshawe
,
hapless
as
I
am
,
according
to
your
showing
,
sixpence
I
would
not
give
to
purchase
you
,
body
and
soul
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
because
I
am
not
clever
,
and
that
is
all
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
think
of
.
<EOS>
Nobody
in
the
world
<EOS>
but
you
cares
for
cleverness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
I
consider
you
_
are
_
clever
,
in
your
way
 
very
smart
indeed
.
<EOS>
But
you
were
talking
of
breaking
hearts
 
<EOS>
that
edifying
amusement
into
the
merits
of
which
I
do
n't
quite
enter
;
pray
on
whom
does
your
vanity
lead
you
to
think
you
have
done
execution
to
-
night
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
approached
her
lips
to
my
ear
 
<EOS>
"
Isidore
and
Alfred
de
Hamal
are
both
here
?
<EOS>
"
she
whispered
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
they
are
?
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
dear
creature
!
<EOS>
your
curiosity
is
roused
at
last
.
<EOS>
Follow
me
,
I
will
point
them
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
proudly
led
the
way
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
can
not
see
them
well
from
the
classes
,
"
said
she
,
turning
,
"
Madame
keeps
them
too
far
off
.
<EOS>
Let
us
cross
the
garden
,
enter
by
the
corridor
,
and
get
close
to
them
behind
:
we
shall
be
scolded
if
we
are
seen
,
but
never
mind
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
once
,
I
did
not
mind
.
<EOS>
Through
the
garden
we
went
 
penetrated
into
the
corridor
by
a
quiet
private
entrance
,
and
approaching
the
_
carré
_
,
yet
keeping
in
the
corridor
shade
,
commanded
a
near
view
of
the
band
of
"
jeunes
gens
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
believe
I
could
have
picked
out
the
conquering
de
Hamal
even
undirected
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
straight
-
nosed
,
very
correct
-
featured
little
dandy
.
<EOS>
I
say
_
little
_
dandy
,
though
he
was
not
beneath
the
middle
standard
in
stature
;
but
his
lineaments
were
small
,
and
so
were
his
hands
and
feet
;
and
he
was
pretty
and
smooth
,
and
as
trim
as
a
doll
:
so
nicely
dressed
,
so
nicely
curled
,
so
booted
and
gloved
and
cravated
 
<EOS>
he
was
charming
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
said
so
.
<EOS>
"
What
,
a
dear
personage
!
<EOS>
"
cried
I
,
and
commended
Ginevra
's
taste
warmly
;
and
asked
her
what
she
thought
de
Hamal
might
have
done
with
the
precious
fragments
of
that
heart
she
had
broken
 
whether
he
kept
them
in
a
scent
-
vial
,
and
conserved
them
in
otto
of
roses
?
<EOS>
I
observed
,
too
,
with
deep
rapture
of
approbation
,
that
the
colonel
's
hands
were
scarce
larger
than
Miss
Fanshawe
's
own
,
and
suggested
that
this
circumstance
might
be
convenient
,
as
he
could
wear
her
gloves
at
a
pinch
.
<EOS>
On
his
dear
curls
,
I
told
her
I
doated
:
and
as
to
his
low
,
Grecian
brow
,
and
exquisite
classic
headpiece
,
I
confessed
I
had
no
language
to
do
such
perfections
justice
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
he
were
your
lover
?
"
suggested
the
cruelly
exultant
Ginevra
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
heavens
,
what
bliss
!
"
said
I
;
"
but
do
not
be
inhuman
,
Miss
Fanshawe
:
to
put
such
thoughts
into
my
head
is
like
showing
poor
outcast
<EOS>
Cain
a
far
,
glimpse
of
Paradise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
like
him
,
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
I
like
sweets
,
and
jams
,
and
comfits
,
and
conservatory
flowers
.
"
  
<EOS>
Ginevra
admired
my
taste
,
for
all
these
things
were
her
adoration
;
she
could
then
readily
credit
that
they
were
mine
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
for
Isidore
,
"
I
went
on
.
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
felt
still
more
curious
to
see
him
than
his
rival
;
but
Ginevra
was
absorbed
in
the
latter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alfred
was
admitted
here
to
-
night
,
"
said
she
,
"
through
the
influence
of
his
aunt
,
Madame
la
Baronne
de
Dorlodot
;
and
now
,
having
seen
him
,
can
you
not
understand
why
I
have
been
in
such
spirits
all
the
evening
,
and
acted
so
well
,
and
danced
with
such
life
,
and
why
I
am
now
happy
as
a
queen
?
<EOS>
Dieu
!
<EOS>
Dieu
!
<EOS>
It
was
such
good
fun
to
glance
first
at
him
and
then
at
the
other
,
and
madden
them
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
that
other
 
<EOS>
where
is
he
?
<EOS>
Show
me
Isidore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
ashamed
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
what
reason
?
"
  
"
Because
 
because
"
(
in
a
whisper
)
"
he
has
such
 
such
whiskers
,
orange
 
red
 
there
now
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
murder
is
out
,
"
I
subjoined
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Never
mind
,
show
him
all
the
same
;
I
engage
not
to
faint
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
round
.
<EOS>
Just
then
an
English
voice
spoke
behind
her
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
both
standing
in
a
draught
;
you
must
leave
this
corridor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
draught
,
Dr.
John
,
"
said
I
,
turning
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
takes
cold
so
easily
,
"
he
pursued
,
looking
at
Ginevra
with
extreme
kindness
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
delicate
;
she
must
be
cared
for
:
fetch
her
a
shawl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Permit
me
to
judge
for
myself
,
"
said
Miss
Fanshawe
,
with
hauteur
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
no
shawl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
dress
is
thin
,
you
have
been
dancing
,
you
are
heated
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Always
preaching
,
"
retorted
she
;
"
always
coddling
and
admonishing
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
answer
Dr.
John
would
have
given
did
not
come
;
that
his
heart
was
hurt
became
evident
in
his
eye
;
darkened
,
and
saddened
,
and
pained
,
he
turned
a
little
aside
,
but
was
patient
.
<EOS>
I
knew
where
there
were
plenty
of
shawls
near
at
hand
;
I
ran
and
fetched
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
shall
wear
this
,
if
I
have
strength
to
make
her
,
"
said
I
,
folding
it
well
round
her
muslin
dress
,
covering
carefully
her
neck
and
her
arms
.
<EOS>
"
Is
that
Isidore
?
"
<EOS>
I
asked
,
in
a
somewhat
fierce
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
She
pushed
up
her
lip
,
smiled
,
and
nodded
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
_
<EOS>
that
_
Isidore
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
,
giving
her
a
shake
:
I
could
have
given
her
a
dozen
.
  
<EOS>
"
C'est
lui
-
même
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
How
coarse
he
is
,
compared
with
the
Colonel
-
Count
!
<EOS>
And
then
 
oh
ciel
!
 
<EOS>
the
whiskers
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
John
now
passed
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Colonel
-
Count
!
<EOS>
"
I
echoed
.
<EOS>
"
The
doll
 
the
puppet
 
<EOS>
the
manikin
 
the
poor
inferior
creature
!
<EOS>
A
mere
lackey
for
Dr.
John
his
valet
,
his
foot
-
boy
!
<EOS>
Is
it
possible
that
fine
generous
gentleman
 
handsome
as
a
vision
 
offers
you
his
honourable
hand
and
gallant
heart
,
and
promises
to
protect
your
flimsy
person
and
feckless
mind
through
the
storms
and
struggles
of
life
 
and
<EOS>
you
hang
back
 
you
scorn
<EOS>
,
you
sting
,
you
torture
him
!
<EOS>
Have
you
power
to
do
this
?
<EOS>
Who
gave
you
that
power
?
<EOS>
Where
is
it
?
<EOS>
Does
it
lie
all
in
your
beauty
 
your
pink
and
white
complexion
,
and
your
yellow
hair
?
<EOS>
Does
this
bind
his
soul
at
your
feet
,
and
bend
his
neck
under
your
yoke
?
<EOS>
Does
this
purchase
for
you
his
affection
,
his
tenderness
,
his
thoughts
,
his
hopes
,
his
interest
,
his
noble
,
cordial
love
 
and
<EOS>
will
you
not
have
it
?
<EOS>
Do
you
scorn
it
?
<EOS>
You
are
only
dissembling
<EOS>
:
you
are
not
in
earnest
:
you
love
him
;
you
long
for
him
;
but
you
trifle
with
his
heart
to
make
him
more
surely
yours
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
<EOS>
How
you
run
on
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
understand
half
you
have
said

"
  
I
had
got
her
out
into
the
garden
ere
this
.
<EOS>
I
now
set
her
down
on
a
seat
and
told
her
she
should
not
stir
till
she
had
avowed
which
she
meant
in
the
end
to
accept
 
the
man
or
the
monkey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Him
you
call
the
man
,
"
said
she
,
"
is
bourgeois
,
sandy
-
haired
,
and
answers
to
the
name
of
John
!
 
<EOS>
cela

<EOS>
Colonel
de
Hamal
is
a
gentleman
of
excellent
connections
,
perfect
manners
,
sweet
appearance
,
with
pale
interesting
face
,
and
hair
and
eyes
like
an
Italian
.
<EOS>
Then
too
he
is
the
most
delightful
company
possible
 
a
man
quite
in
my
way
;
not
sensible
and
serious
like
the
other
;
but
one
with
whom
I
can
talk
on
equal
terms
 
who
does
not
plague
and
bore
,
and
harass
me
with
depths
,
and
heights
,
and
passions
,
and
talents
for
which
I
have
no
taste
.
<EOS>
There
now
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
hold
me
so
fast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
slackened
my
grasp
,
and
she
darted
off
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
care
to
pursue
her
.
  
<EOS>
Somehow
I
could
not
avoid
returning
once
more
in
the
direction
of
the
corridor
to
get
another
glimpse
of
Dr.
John
;
but
I
met
him
on
the
garden
-
steps
,
standing
where
the
light
from
a
window
fell
broad
.
<EOS>
His
well
-
proportioned
figure
was
not
to
be
mistaken
,
for
I
doubt
whether
there
was
another
in
that
assemblage
his
equal
.
<EOS>
He
carried
his
hat
in
his
hand
;
his
uncovered
head
,
his
face
and
fine
brow
were
most
handsome
and
manly
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
His
_
features
were
not
delicate
,
not
slight
like
those
of
a
woman
,
nor
were
they
cold
,
frivolous
,
and
feeble
;
though
well
cut
,
they
were
not
so
chiselled
,
so
frittered
away
,
as
to
lose
in
expression
or
significance
what
they
gained
in
unmeaning
symmetry
.
<EOS>
Much
feeling
spoke
in
them
at
times
,
and
more
sat
silent
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
Such
at
least
were
my
thoughts
of
him
:
to
me
he
seemed
all
this
.
<EOS>
An
inexpressible
sense
of
wonder
occupied
me
,
as
I
looked
at
this
man
,
and
reflected
that
_
he
_
could
not
be
slighted
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
,
not
my
intention
to
approach
or
address
him
in
the
garden
,
our
terms
of
acquaintance
not
warranting
such
a
step
;
I
had
only
meant
to
view
him
in
the
crowd
 
myself
unseen
:
coming
upon
him
thus
alone
,
I
withdrew
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
looking
out
for
me
,
or
rather
for
her
who
had
been
with
me
:
therefore
he
descended
the
steps
,
and
followed
me
down
the
alley
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
Miss
Fanshawe
?
<EOS>
I
have
often
wished
to
ask
whether
you
knew
her
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
:
I
know
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Intimately
?
"
  
"
Quite
as
intimately
as
I
wish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
done
with
her
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
her
keeper
?
<EOS>
"
I
felt
inclined
to
ask
;
but
I
simply
answered
,
"
I
have
shaken
her
well
,
and
would
have
shaken
her
better
,
but
she
escaped
out
of
my
hands
and
ran
away
.
"
  
"
Would
you
favour
me
,
"
he
asked
,
"
by
watching
over
her
this
one
evening
,
and
observing
that
she
does
nothing
imprudent
 
does
not
,
for
instance
,
run
out
into
the
night
-
air
immediately
after
dancing
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
,
perhaps
,
look
after
her
a
little
;
since
you
wish
it
;
but
she
likes
her
own
way
too
well
to
submit
readily
to
control
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
so
young
,
so
thoroughly
artless
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
me
she
is
an
enigma
,
"
I
responded
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
 
much
interested
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
difficult
to
say
how
 
difficult
,
at
least
,
to
tell
_
you
<EOS>
_
how
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
she
is
not
better
pleased
that
you
are
so
much
her
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
she
has
not
the
slightest
idea
<EOS>
how
much
I
_
am
_
her
friend
.
<EOS>
That
is
precisely
the
point
I
can
not
teach
her
.
<EOS>
May
I
inquire
did
she
ever
speak
of
me
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Under
the
name
of
"
Isidore
"
she
has
talked
about
you
often
;
but
I
must
add
that
it
is
only
within
the
last
ten
minutes
I
have
discovered
that
you
and
"
Isidore
"
are
identical
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
,
Dr.
John
,
within
that
brief
space
of
time
I
have
learned
that
Ginevra
Fanshawe
is
the
person
,
under
this
roof
,
in
whom
you
have
long
been
interested
 
that
she
is
the
magnet
which
attracts
you
to
the
Rue
Fossette
,
that
for
her
sake
you
venture
into
this
garden
,
and
seek
out
caskets
dropped
by
rivals
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
so
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
more
than
a
year
I
have
been
accustomed
to
meet
her
in
society
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
,
her
friend
,
is
an
acquaintance
of
mine
;
thus
I
see
her
every
Sunday
.
<EOS>
But
you
observed
that
under
the
name
of
"
Isidore
"
she
often
spoke
of
me
:
may
I
 
without
inviting
you
to
a
breach
of
confidence
 
<EOS>
inquire
<EOS>
what
was
the
tone
,
<EOS>
what
the
feeling
of
her
remarks
?
<EOS>
I
feel
somewhat
anxious
to
know
,
being
a
little
tormented
with
uncertainty
as
to
how
I
stand
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
she
varies
:
<EOS>
she
shifts
and
changes
like
the
wind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Still
,
you
can
gather
some
general
idea
 
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
"
thought
I
,
"
but
it
would
not
do
to
communicate
that
general
idea
to
you
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
if
I
said
she
did
not
love
you
,
I
know
you
would
not
believe
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
silent
,
"
he
pursued
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
have
no
good
news
to
impart
.
<EOS>
No
matter
.
<EOS>
If
she
feels
for
me
<EOS>
positive
coldness
and
aversion
<EOS>
,
it
is
a
sign
I
do
not
deserve
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
doubt
yourself
?
<EOS>
Do
you
consider
yourself
the
inferior
of
Colonel
de
Hamal
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
love
Miss
Fanshawe
far
more
than
de
Hamal
loves
any
human
being
,
and
would
care
for
and
guard
her
better
than
he
.
<EOS>
Respecting
de
Hamal
,
I
fear
she
is
under
an
illusion
;
the
man
's
character
is
known
to
me
,
all
his
antecedents
,
all
his
scrapes
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
worthy
of
your
beautiful
young
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
"
beautiful
young
friend
"
ought
to
know
that
,
and
to
know
or
feel
who
is
worthy
of
her
,
"
said
I.
"
<EOS>
If
her
beauty
or
her
brains
will
not
serve
her
so
far
,
she
merits
the
sharp
lesson
of
experience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
not
a
little
severe
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
excessively
severe
 
more
severe
than
I
choose
to
show
you
.
<EOS>
You
should
hear
the
strictures
with
which
I
favour
my
"
beautiful
young
friend
,
"
only
that
you
would
be
unutterably
shocked
at
my
want
of
tender
considerateness
for
her
delicate
nature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
so
lovely
,
one
can
not
but
be
loving
towards
her
.
<EOS>
You
 
every
woman
older
than
herself
,
must
feel
for
such
a
simple
,
innocent
,
girlish
fairy
a
sort
of
motherly
or
elder
-
sisterly
fondness
.
<EOS>
Graceful
angel
!
<EOS>
Does
not
your
heart
yearn
towards
her
when
she
pours
into
your
ear
her
pure
,
childlike
confidences
?
<EOS>
How
you
are
privileged
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
sighed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
cut
short
these
confidences
somewhat
abruptly
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
"
said
I.
"
<EOS>
But
excuse
me
,
Dr.
John
,
may
I
change
the
theme
for
one
instant
?
<EOS>
What
a
god
-
like
person
is
that
de
Hamal
!
<EOS>
What
a
nose
on
his
face
 
perfect
!
<EOS>
Model
one
in
putty
or
clay
,
you
could
not
make
a
better
or
straighter
,
or
neater
;
and
then
,
such
classic
lips
and
chin
 
and
his
bearing
 
sublime
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
De
Hamal
is
an
unutterable
puppy
,
besides
being
a
very
white
-
livered
hero
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
,
Dr.
John
,
and
every
man
of
a
less
-
refined
mould
than
he
,
must
feel
for
him
a
sort
of
admiring
affection
,
such
as
Mars
and
the
coarser
deities
may
be
supposed
to
have
borne
the
young
,
graceful
Apollo
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
An
unprincipled
,
gambling
little
jackanapes
!
"
said
Dr.
John
curtly
,
"
whom
,
with
one
hand
,
I
could
lift
up
by
the
waistband
any
day
,
and
lay
low
in
the
kennel
if
I
liked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
sweet
seraph
!
"
said
I.
"
<EOS>
What
a
cruel
idea
!
<EOS>
Are
you
not
a
little
severe
,
Dr.
John
?
"
  
<EOS>
And
now
I
paused
.
<EOS>
For
the
second
time
that
night
I
was
going
beyond
myself
 
venturing
out
of
what
I
looked
on
as
my
natural
habits
 
speaking
in
an
unpremeditated
,
impulsive
strain
,
which
startled
me
strangely
when
I
halted
to
reflect
.
<EOS>
On
rising
that
morning
,
had
I
anticipated
that
before
night
I
should
have
acted
the
part
of
a
gay
lover
in
a
vaudeville
;
and
an
hour
after
,
frankly
discussed
with
Dr.
John
the
question
of
his
hapless
suit
,
and
rallied
him
on
his
illusions
?
<EOS>
I
had
no
more
presaged
such
feats
than
I
had
looked
forward
to
an
ascent
in
a
balloon
,
or
a
voyage
to
Cape
Horn
.
  
<EOS>
The
Doctor
and
I
,
having
paced
down
the
walk
,
were
now
returning
;
the
reflex
from
the
window
again
lit
his
face
:
he
smiled
,
but
his
eye
was
melancholy
.
<EOS>
How
I
wished
that
he
could
feel
heart's
-
ease
!
<EOS>
How
I
grieved
that
he
brooded
over
pain
,
and
pain
from
such
a
cause
!
<EOS>
He
,
with
his
great
advantages
,
_
he
_
to
love
in
vain
!
<EOS>
I
did
not
then
know
that
the
pensiveness
of
reverse
is
the
best
phase
for
some
minds
;
nor
did
I
reflect
that
some
herbs
,
"
though
scentless
when
entire
,
yield
fragrance
when
they
're
bruised
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
be
sorrowful
,
do
not
grieve
,
"
I
broke
out
.
<EOS>
"
If
there
is
in
Ginevra
one
spark
of
worthiness
of
your
affection
,
she
will
 
she
_
must
_
feel
devotion
in
return
.
<EOS>
Be
cheerful
,
be
hopeful
,
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
Who
should
hope
,
if
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
In
return
for
this
speech
I
got
 
<EOS>
what
,
it
must
be
supposed
,
I
deserved
 
a
look
of
surprise
:
I
thought
also
of
some
disapprobation
.
<EOS>
We
parted
,
and
I
went
into
the
house
very
chill
.
<EOS>
The
clocks
struck
and
the
bells
tolled
midnight
;
people
were
leaving
fast
:
the
fête
was
over
;
the
lamps
were
fading
.
<EOS>
In
another
hour
all
the
dwelling
-
house
,
and
all
the
pensionnat
,
were
dark
and
hushed
.
<EOS>
I
too
was
in
bed
,
but
not
asleep
.
<EOS>
To
me
it
was
not
easy
to
sleep
after
a
day
of
such
excitement
.
    
<EOS>
THE
LONG
VACATION
.
  
<EOS>
Following
Madame
Beck
's
fête
,
with
its
three
preceding
weeks
of
relaxation
,
its
brief
twelve
hours
'
burst
of
hilarity
and
dissipation
,
and
its
one
subsequent
day
of
utter
languor
,
came
a
period
of
reaction
;
two
months
of
real
application
,
of
close
,
hard
study
.
<EOS>
These
two
months
,
being
the
last
of
the
"
année
scolaire
,
"
were
indeed
the
only
genuine
working
months
in
the
year
.
<EOS>
To
them
was
procrastinated
 
into
them
concentrated
,
alike
by
professors
,
mistresses
,
and
pupils
 
the
main
burden
of
preparation
for
the
examinations
preceding
the
distribution
of
prizes
.
<EOS>
Candidates
for
rewards
had
then
to
work
in
good
earnest
;
masters
and
teachers
had
to
set
their
shoulders
to
the
wheel
,
to
urge
on
the
backward
,
and
diligently
aid
and
train
the
more
promising
.
<EOS>
A
showy
demonstration
 
a
telling
exhibition
 
must
be
got
up
for
public
view
,
and
all
means
were
fair
to
this
end
.
  
<EOS>
I
scarcely
noted
how
the
other
teachers
went
to
work
;
I
had
my
own
business
to
mind
;
and
_
<EOS>
my
_
task
was
not
the
least
onerous
,
being
to
imbue
some
ninety
sets
of
brains
with
a
due
tincture
of
what
they
considered
a
most
complicated
and
difficult
science
,
that
of
the
English
language
;
and
to
drill
ninety
tongues
in
what
,
for
them
,
was
an
almost
impossible
pronunciation
 
the
lisping
and
hissing
dentals
of
the
Isles
.
  
<EOS>
The
examination
-
day
arrived
.
<EOS>
Awful
day
!
<EOS>
Prepared
for
with
anxious
care
,
dressed
for
with
silent
despatch
 
<EOS>
nothing
vaporous
or
fluttering
now
 
no
white
gauze
or
azure
streamers
<EOS>
;
the
grave
,
close
,
compact
was
the
order
of
the
toilette
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
me
that
I
was
this
day
,
especially
doomed
 
the
main
burden
and
trial
falling
on
me
alone
of
all
the
female
teachers
.
<EOS>
The
others
were
not
expected
to
examine
in
the
studies
they
taught
;
the
professor
of
literature
,
M.
Paul
,
taking
upon
himself
this
duty
.
<EOS>
He
,
this
school
autocrat
,
gathered
all
and
sundry
reins
into
the
hollow
of
his
one
hand
;
he
irefully
rejected
any
colleague
;
he
would
not
have
help
.
<EOS>
Madame
herself
,
who
evidently
rather
wished
to
undertake
the
examination
in
geography
 
her
favourite
study
,
which
she
taught
well
 
was
forced
to
succumb
,
and
be
subordinate
to
her
despotic
kinsman
's
direction
.
<EOS>
The
whole
staff
of
instructors
,
male
and
female
,
he
set
aside
,
and
stood
on
the
examiner
's
estrade
alone
.
<EOS>
It
irked
him
that
he
was
forced
to
make
one
exception
to
this
rule
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
manage
English
:
he
was
obliged
to
leave
that
branch
of
education
in
the
English
teacher
's
hands
;
which
he
did
,
not
without
a
flash
of
naïve
jealousy
.
  
<EOS>
A
constant
crusade
against
the
"
amour
-
propre
"
of
every
human
being
but
himself
,
was
the
crotchet
of
this
able
,
but
fiery
and
grasping
little
man
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
strong
relish
for
public
representation
in
his
own
person
,
but
an
extreme
abhorrence
of
the
like
display
in
any
other
.
<EOS>
He
quelled
,
he
kept
down
when
he
could
;
and
when
he
could
not
,
he
fumed
like
a
bottled
storm
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
evening
preceding
the
examination
-
day
,
I
was
walking
in
the
garden
,
as
were
the
other
teachers
and
all
the
boarders
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
joined
me
in
the
"
allée
défendue
;
"
his
cigar
was
at
his
lips
;
his
paletôt
 
a
most
characteristic
garment
of
no
particular
shape
 
hung
dark
and
menacing
;
the
tassel
of
his
bonnet
grec
sternly
shadowed
his
left
temple
;
his
black
whiskers
curled
like
those
of
a
wrathful
cat
;
his
blue
eye
had
a
cloud
in
its
glitter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ainsi
,
"
he
began
,
abruptly
fronting
and
arresting
me
,
"
vous
allez
trôner
comme
une
reine
;
demain
 
trôner
à
mes
côtés
?
<EOS>
Sans
doute
vous
savourez
d'avance
les
délices
de
l'autorité
.
<EOS>
Je
crois
voir
en
<EOS>
je
ne
sais
quoi
de
rayonnante
,
petite
ambitieuse
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
the
fact
was
,
he
happened
to
be
entirely
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
 
could
not
 
estimate
the
admiration
or
the
good
opinion
of
tomorrow
's
audience
at
the
same
rate
he
did
.
<EOS>
Had
that
audience
numbered
as
many
personal
friends
and
acquaintance
for
me
as
for
him
,
I
know
not
how
it
might
have
been
<EOS>
:
I
speak
of
the
case
as
it
stood
.
<EOS>
On
me
school
-
triumphs
shed
but
a
cold
lustre
.
<EOS>
I
had
wondered
 
<EOS>
and
I
wondered
now
 
how
it
was
that
for
him
they
seemed
to
shine
as
with
hearth
-
warmth
and
hearth
-
glow
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
cared
for
them
perhaps
too
much
;
_
<EOS>
I
_
,
probably
,
too
little
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
had
my
own
fancies
as
well
as
he
.
<EOS>
I
liked
,
for
instance
,
to
see
M.
Emanuel
jealous
;
it
lit
up
his
nature
,
and
woke
his
spirit
;
it
threw
all
sorts
of
queer
lights
and
shadows
over
his
dun
face
,
and
into
his
violet
-
azure
eyes
(
he
used
to
say
that
his
black
hair
and
blue
eyes
were
"
une
de
ses
beautés
"
)
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
relish
in
his
anger
;
it
was
artless
,
earnest
,
quite
unreasonable
,
but
never
hypocritical
.
<EOS>
I
uttered
no
disclaimer
then
of
the
complacency
he
attributed
to
me
;
I
merely
asked
where
the
English
examination
came
in
 
whether
at
the
commencement
or
close
of
the
day
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
hesitate
,
"
said
he
,
"
whether
at
the
very
beginning
,
before
many
persons
are
come
,
and
when
your
aspiring
nature
will
not
be
gratified
by
a
large
audience
,
or
quite
at
the
close
,
when
everybody
is
tired
,
and
only
a
jaded
and
worn
-
out
attention
will
be
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Que
vous
êtes
dur
,
Monsieur
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
affecting
dejection
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
ought
to
be
"
dur
"
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
one
of
those
beings
who
must
be
_
kept
down
_
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
!
<EOS>
I
know
you
!
<EOS>
Other
people
in
this
house
see
you
pass
,
and
think
that
a
colourless
shadow
has
gone
by
.
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
I
scrutinized
your
face
once
,
and
it
sufficed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
satisfied
that
you
understand
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Without
answering
directly
,
he
went
on
,
"
Were
you
not
gratified
when
you
succeeded
in
that
vaudeville
?
<EOS>
I
watched
you
and
saw
a
passionate
ardour
for
triumph
in
your
physiognomy
.
<EOS>
What
fire
shot
into
the
glance
!
<EOS>
Not
mere
light
,
but
flame
:
<EOS>
je
me
tiens
pour
averti
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
feeling
I
had
on
that
occasion
,
Monsieur
 
and
pardon
me
,
if
I
say
,
you
immensely
exaggerate
both
its
quality
and
quantity
 
was
quite
abstract
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
care
for
the
vaudeville
.
<EOS>
I
hated
the
part
you
assigned
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
the
slightest
sympathy
with
the
audience
below
the
stage
.
<EOS>
They
are
good
people
,
doubtless
,
but
do
I
know
them
?
<EOS>
Are
they
anything
to
me
?
<EOS>
Can
I
care
for
being
brought
before
their
view
again
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
Will
the
examination
be
anything
but
a
task
to
me
 
a
task
I
wish
well
over
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
take
it
out
of
your
hands
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
all
my
heart
;
if
you
do
not
fear
failure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
should
fail
.
<EOS>
I
only
know
three
phrases
of
English
,
and
a
few
words
:
<EOS>
par
exemple
,
de
sonn
,
de
mone
,
de
stares
 
est
-
ce
bien
dit
?
<EOS>
My
opinion
is
that
it
would
be
better
to
give
up
the
thing
altogether
:
to
have
no
English
examination
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
Madame
consents
,
I
consent
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Heartily
?
"
  
"
Very
heartily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
smoked
his
cigar
in
silence
.
<EOS>
He
turned
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Donnez
-
moi
<EOS>
la
main
,
"
said
he
,
and
the
spite
and
jealousy
melted
out
of
his
face
,
and
a
generous
kindliness
shone
there
instead
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
we
will
not
be
rivals
,
we
will
be
friends
,
"
he
pursued
.
<EOS>
"
The
examination
shall
take
place
,
and
I
will
choose
a
good
moment
;
and
instead
of
vexing
and
hindering
,
as
I
felt
half
-
inclined
ten
minutes
ago
 
for
I
have
my
malevolent
moods
:
I
always
had
from
childhood
 
<EOS>
I
will
aid
you
sincerely
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
you
are
solitary
and
a
stranger
,
and
have
your
way
to
make
and
your
bread
to
earn
;
it
may
be
well
that
you
should
become
known
.
<EOS>
We
will
be
friends
:
do
you
agree
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Out
of
my
heart
,
Monsieur
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
a
friend
.
<EOS>
I
like
that
better
than
a
triumph
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pauvrette
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
and
turned
away
and
left
the
alley
.
  
<EOS>
The
examination
passed
over
well
;
M.
Paul
was
as
good
as
his
word
,
and
did
his
best
to
make
my
part
easy
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
came
the
distribution
of
prizes
;
that
also
passed
;
the
school
broke
up
;
the
pupils
went
home
,
and
now
began
the
long
vacation
.
  
<EOS>
That
vacation
!
<EOS>
Shall
I
ever
forget
it
?
<EOS>
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
went
,
the
first
day
of
the
holidays
,
to
join
her
children
at
the
sea
-
side
;
all
the
three
teachers
had
parents
or
friends
with
whom
they
took
refuge
;
every
professor
quitted
the
city
;
some
went
to
Paris
,
some
to
Boue
-
Marine
;
M.
Paul
set
forth
on
a
pilgrimage
to
Rome
;
the
house
was
left
quite
empty
,
but
for
me
,
a
servant
,
and
a
poor
deformed
and
imbecile
pupil
,
a
sort
of
crétin
,
whom
her
stepmother
in
a
distant
province
would
not
allow
to
return
home
.
  
<EOS>
My
heart
almost
died
within
me
;
miserable
longings
strained
its
chords
.
<EOS>
How
long
were
the
September
days
!
<EOS>
How
silent
,
how
lifeless
!
<EOS>
How
vast
and
void
seemed
the
desolate
premises
!
<EOS>
How
gloomy
the
forsaken
garden
 
grey
now
with
the
dust
of
a
town
summer
departed
.
<EOS>
Looking
forward
at
the
commencement
of
those
eight
weeks
,
I
hardly
knew
how
I
was
to
live
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
My
spirits
had
long
been
gradually
sinking
;
now
that
the
prop
of
employment
was
withdrawn
,
they
went
down
fast
.
<EOS>
Even
to
look
forward
was
not
to
hope
:
the
dumb
future
spoke
no
comfort
,
offered
no
promise
,
gave
no
inducement
to
bear
present
evil
in
reliance
on
future
good
.
<EOS>
A
sorrowful
indifference
to
existence
often
pressed
on
me
 
a
despairing
resignation
to
reach
betimes
the
end
of
all
things
earthly
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
When
I
had
full
leisure
to
look
on
life
as
life
must
be
looked
on
by
such
as
me
,
I
found
it
but
a
hopeless
desert
:
tawny
sands
,
with
no
green
fields
,
no
palm
-
tree
,
no
well
in
view
.
<EOS>
The
hopes
which
are
dear
to
youth
,
which
bear
it
up
and
lead
it
on
,
I
knew
not
and
dared
not
know
.
<EOS>
If
they
knocked
at
my
heart
sometimes
,
an
inhospitable
bar
to
admission
must
be
inwardly
drawn
.
<EOS>
When
they
turned
away
thus
rejected
,
tears
sad
enough
sometimes
flowed
:
but
it
could
not
be
helped
:
I
dared
not
give
such
guests
lodging
.
<EOS>
So
mortally
did
I
fear
the
sin
and
weakness
of
presumption
.
  
<EOS>
Religious
reader
,
you
will
preach
to
me
a
long
sermon
about
what
I
have
just
written
,
and
so
will
you
,
moralist
:
<EOS>
and
you
,
stern
sage
:
you
,
stoic
,
will
frown
;
<EOS>
you
,
cynic
,
sneer
;
you
,
epicure
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
Well
,
each
and
all
,
take
it
your
own
way
.
<EOS>
I
accept
the
sermon
,
frown
,
sneer
,
and
laugh
;
perhaps
you
are
all
right
:
and
perhaps
,
circumstanced
like
me
,
you
would
have
been
,
like
me
,
wrong
.
<EOS>
The
first
month
was
,
indeed
,
a
long
,
black
,
heavy
month
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
crétin
did
not
seem
unhappy
.
<EOS>
I
did
my
best
to
feed
her
well
and
keep
her
warm
,
and
she
only
asked
food
and
sunshine
,
or
when
that
lacked
,
fire
.
<EOS>
Her
weak
faculties
approved
of
inertion
:
her
brain
,
her
eyes
,
her
ears
,
her
heart
slept
content
;
they
could
not
wake
to
work
,
so
lethargy
was
their
Paradise
.
  
<EOS>
Three
weeks
of
that
vacation
were
hot
,
fair
,
and
dry
,
but
the
fourth
and
fifth
were
tempestuous
and
wet
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why
that
change
in
the
atmosphere
made
a
cruel
impression
on
me
,
why
the
raging
storm
and
beating
rain
crushed
me
with
a
deadlier
paralysis
than
I
had
experienced
while
the
air
had
remained
serene
;
but
so
it
was
;
and
my
nervous
system
could
hardly
support
what
it
had
for
many
days
and
nights
to
undergo
in
that
huge
empty
house
.
<EOS>
How
I
used
to
pray
to
Heaven
for
consolation
and
support
!
<EOS>
With
what
dread
force
the
conviction
would
grasp
me
that
Fate
was
my
permanent
foe
,
never
to
be
conciliated
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
,
in
my
heart
,
arraign
the
mercy
or
justice
of
God
for
this
;
I
concluded
it
to
be
a
part
of
his
great
plan
that
some
must
deeply
suffer
while
they
live
,
and
I
thrilled
in
the
certainty
that
of
this
number
<EOS>
,
I
was
one
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
some
relief
when
an
aunt
of
the
crétin
,
a
kind
old
woman
,
came
one
day
,
and
took
away
my
strange
,
deformed
companion
.
<EOS>
The
hapless
creature
had
been
at
times
a
heavy
charge
;
I
could
not
take
her
out
beyond
the
garden
,
and
I
could
not
leave
her
a
minute
alone
:
for
her
poor
mind
,
like
her
body
,
was
warped
:
its
propensity
was
to
evil
.
<EOS>
A
vague
bent
to
mischief
,
an
aimless
malevolence
,
made
constant
vigilance
indispensable
.
<EOS>
As
she
very
rarely
spoke
,
and
would
sit
for
hours
together
moping
and
mowing
,
and
distorting
her
features
with
indescribable
grimaces
,
it
was
more
like
being
prisoned
with
some
strange
tameless
animal
,
than
associating
with
a
human
being
.
<EOS>
Then
there
were
personal
attentions
to
be
rendered
which
required
the
nerve
of
a
hospital
nurse
;
my
resolution
was
so
tried
,
it
sometimes
fell
dead
-
sick
.
<EOS>
These
duties
should
not
have
fallen
on
me
;
a
servant
,
now
absent
,
had
rendered
them
hitherto
,
and
in
the
hurry
of
holiday
departure
,
no
substitute
to
fill
this
office
had
been
provided
.
<EOS>
This
tax
and
trial
were
by
no
means
the
least
I
have
known
in
life
.
<EOS>
Still
,
menial
and
distasteful
as
they
were
,
my
mental
pain
was
far
more
wasting
and
wearing
.
<EOS>
Attendance
on
the
crétin
deprived
me
often
of
the
power
and
inclination
to
swallow
a
meal
,
and
sent
me
faint
to
the
fresh
air
,
and
the
well
or
fountain
in
the
court
;
but
this
duty
never
wrung
my
heart
,
or
brimmed
my
eyes
,
or
scalded
my
cheek
with
tears
hot
as
molten
metal
.
  
<EOS>
The
crétin
being
gone
,
I
was
free
to
walk
out
.
<EOS>
At
first
I
lacked
courage
to
venture
very
far
from
the
Rue
Fossette
,
but
by
degrees
I
sought
the
city
gates
,
and
passed
them
,
and
then
went
wandering
away
far
along
chaussées
,
through
fields
,
beyond
cemeteries
,
Catholic
and
Protestant
,
beyond
farmsteads
,
to
lanes
and
little
woods
,
and
I
know
not
where
.
<EOS>
A
goad
thrust
me
on
<EOS>
,
a
fever
forbade
me
to
rest
;
a
want
of
companionship
maintained
in
my
soul
the
cravings
of
a
most
deadly
famine
.
<EOS>
I
often
walked
all
day
,
through
the
burning
noon
and
the
arid
afternoon
,
and
the
dusk
evening
,
and
came
back
with
moonrise
.
  
<EOS>
While
wandering
in
solitude
,
I
would
sometimes
picture
the
present
probable
position
of
others
,
my
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
There
was
Madame
Beck
at
a
cheerful
watering
-
place
with
her
children
,
her
mother
,
and
a
whole
troop
of
friends
who
had
sought
the
same
scene
of
relaxation
.
<EOS>
Zélie
St.
Pierre
was
at
Paris
,
with
her
relatives
;
the
other
teachers
were
at
their
homes
.
<EOS>
There
was
Ginevra
Fanshawe
,
whom
certain
of
her
connections
had
carried
on
a
pleasant
tour
southward
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
seemed
to
me
the
happiest
.
<EOS>
She
was
on
the
route
of
beautiful
scenery
;
these
September
suns
shone
for
her
on
fertile
plains
,
where
harvest
and
vintage
matured
under
their
mellow
beam
.
<EOS>
These
gold
and
crystal
moons
rose
on
her
vision
over
blue
horizons
waved
in
mounted
lines
.
  
<EOS>
But
all
this
was
nothing
;
I
too
felt
those
autumn
suns
and
saw
those
harvest
moons
,
and
I
almost
wished
to
be
covered
in
with
earth
and
turf
,
deep
out
of
their
influence
;
for
I
could
not
live
in
their
light
,
nor
make
them
comrades
,
nor
yield
them
affection
.
<EOS>
But
Ginevra
had
a
kind
of
spirit
with
her
,
empowered
to
give
constant
strength
and
comfort
,
to
gladden
daylight
and
embalm
darkness
;
the
best
of
the
good
genii
that
guard
humanity
curtained
her
with
his
wings
,
and
canopied
her
head
with
his
bending
form
.
<EOS>
By
True
Love
was
Ginevra
followed
:
never
could
she
be
alone
.
<EOS>
Was
she
insensible
to
this
presence
?
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
me
impossible
:
I
could
not
realize
such
deadness
.
<EOS>
I
imagined
her
grateful
in
secret
,
loving
now
with
reserve
;
but
purposing
one
day
to
show
how
much
she
loved
:
I
pictured
her
faithful
hero
half
conscious
of
her
coy
fondness
,
and
comforted
by
that
consciousness
:
I
conceived
an
electric
chord
of
sympathy
between
them
,
a
fine
chain
of
mutual
understanding
,
sustaining
union
through
a
separation
of
a
hundred
leagues
 
carrying
,
across
mound
and
hollow
,
communication
by
prayer
and
wish
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
gradually
became
with
me
a
sort
of
heroine
.
<EOS>
One
day
,
perceiving
this
growing
illusion
,
I
said
,
"
I
really
believe
my
nerves
are
getting
overstretched
:
my
mind
has
suffered
somewhat
too
much
a
malady
is
growing
upon
it
 
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
How
shall
I
keep
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Indeed
there
was
no
way
to
keep
well
under
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
At
last
a
day
and
night
of
peculiarly
agonizing
depression
were
succeeded
by
physical
illness
,
I
took
perforce
to
my
bed
.
<EOS>
About
this
time
the
Indian
summer
closed
and
the
equinoctial
storms
began
;
and
for
nine
dark
and
wet
days
,
of
which
the
hours
rushed
on
all
turbulent
,
deaf
,
dishevelled
 
bewildered
with
sounding
hurricane
 
<EOS>
I
lay
in
a
strange
fever
of
the
nerves
and
blood
.
<EOS>
Sleep
went
quite
away
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
rise
in
the
night
,
look
round
for
her
,
beseech
her
earnestly
to
return
.
<EOS>
A
rattle
of
the
window
,
a
cry
of
the
blast
only
replied
 
Sleep
never
came
!
  
<EOS>
I
err
.
<EOS>
She
came
once
,
but
in
anger
.
<EOS>
Impatient
of
my
importunity
she
brought
with
her
an
avenging
dream
.
<EOS>
By
the
clock
of
St.
Jean
Baptiste
,
that
dream
remained
scarce
fifteen
minutes
 
<EOS>
a
brief
space
,
but
sufficing
to
wring
my
whole
frame
with
unknown
anguish
;
to
confer
a
nameless
experience
that
had
the
hue
,
the
mien
,
the
terror
,
the
very
tone
of
a
visitation
from
eternity
.
<EOS>
Between
twelve
and
one
that
night
a
cup
was
forced
to
my
lips
,
black
,
strong
,
strange
,
drawn
from
no
well
,
but
filled
up
seething
from
a
bottomless
and
boundless
sea
.
<EOS>
Suffering
,
brewed
in
temporal
or
calculable
measure
,
and
mixed
for
mortal
lips
,
tastes
not
as
this
suffering
tasted
.
<EOS>
Having
drank
and
woke
,
I
thought
all
was
over
:
<EOS>
the
end
come
and
past
by
.
<EOS>
Trembling
fearfully
 
as
consciousness
returned
 
ready
to
cry
out
on
some
fellow
-
creature
to
help
me
,
only
that
I
knew
no
fellow
-
creature
was
near
enough
to
catch
the
wild
summons
 
<EOS>
Goton
in
her
far
distant
attic
could
not
hear
 
<EOS>
I
rose
on
my
knees
in
bed
.
<EOS>
Some
fearful
hours
went
over
me
:
indescribably
was
I
torn
,
racked
and
oppressed
in
mind
.
<EOS>
Amidst
the
horrors
of
that
dream
I
think
the
worst
lay
here
.
<EOS>
Methought
the
well
-
loved
dead
,
who
had
loved
_
me
_
<EOS>
well
in
life
,
met
me
elsewhere
,
alienated
:
<EOS>
galled
was
my
inmost
spirit
with
an
unutterable
sense
of
despair
about
the
future
.
<EOS>
Motive
there
was
none
why
I
should
try
to
recover
or
wish
to
live
;
and
yet
quite
unendurable
was
the
pitiless
and
haughty
voice
in
which
Death
challenged
me
to
engage
his
unknown
terrors
.
<EOS>
When
I
tried
to
pray
I
could
only
utter
these
words
:
"
From
my
youth
up
Thy
terrors
have
I
suffered
with
a
troubled
mind
.
"
  
<EOS>
Most
true
was
it
.
  
<EOS>
On
bringing
me
my
tea
next
morning
Goton
urged
me
to
call
in
a
doctor
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
:
I
thought
no
doctor
could
cure
me
.
  
<EOS>
One
evening
 
<EOS>
and
I
was
not
delirious
:
<EOS>
I
was
in
my
sane
mind
,
<EOS>
I
got
up
 
I
dressed
myself
,
weak
and
shaking
.
<EOS>
The
solitude
and
the
stillness
of
the
long
dormitory
could
not
be
borne
any
longer
;
the
ghastly
white
beds
were
turning
into
spectres
 
the
coronal
of
each
became
a
death's
-
head
,
huge
and
sun
-
bleached
 
<EOS>
dead
dreams
of
an
elder
world
and
mightier
race
lay
frozen
in
their
wide
gaping
eyeholes
.
<EOS>
That
evening
more
firmly
than
ever
fastened
into
my
soul
<EOS>
the
conviction
that
Fate
was
of
stone
,
and
Hope
a
false
idol
 
blind
,
bloodless
,
and
of
granite
core
.
<EOS>
I
felt
,
too
,
that
the
trial
God
had
appointed
me
was
gaining
its
climax
,
and
must
now
be
turned
by
my
own
hands
,
hot
,
feeble
,
trembling
as
they
were
.
<EOS>
It
rained
still
,
and
blew
;
but
with
more
clemency
,
I
thought
,
than
it
had
poured
and
raged
all
day
.
<EOS>
Twilight
was
falling
,
and
I
deemed
its
influence
pitiful
;
from
the
lattice
I
saw
coming
night
-
clouds
trailing
low
like
banners
drooping
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
me
that
at
this
hour
there
was
affection
and
sorrow
in
Heaven
above
for
all
pain
suffered
on
earth
beneath
;
the
weight
of
my
dreadful
dream
became
alleviated
 
that
insufferable
thought
of
being
no
more
loved
 
no
more
owned
,
half
-
yielded
to
hope
of
the
contrary
 
<EOS>
I
was
sure
this
hope
would
shine
clearer
if
I
got
out
from
under
this
house
-
roof
,
which
was
crushing
as
the
slab
of
a
tomb
,
and
went
outside
the
city
to
a
certain
quiet
hill
,
a
long
way
distant
in
the
fields
.
<EOS>
Covered
with
a
cloak
(
I
could
not
be
delirious
,
for
I
had
sense
and
recollection
to
put
on
warm
clothing
)
,
forth
I
set
.
<EOS>
The
bells
of
a
church
arrested
me
in
passing
;
they
seemed
to
call
me
in
to
the
_
salut
_
,
and
I
went
in
.
<EOS>
Any
solemn
rite
,
any
spectacle
of
sincere
worship
,
any
opening
for
appeal
to
God
was
as
welcome
to
me
then
as
bread
to
one
in
extremity
of
want
.
<EOS>
I
knelt
down
with
others
on
the
stone
pavement
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
old
solemn
church
,
its
pervading
gloom
not
gilded
but
purpled
by
light
shed
through
stained
glass
.
  
<EOS>
Few
worshippers
were
assembled
,
and
,
the
_
salut
_
over
,
half
of
them
departed
.
<EOS>
I
discovered
soon
that
those
left
remained
to
confess
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
stir
.
<EOS>
Carefully
every
door
of
the
church
was
shut
;
a
holy
quiet
sank
upon
,
and
a
solemn
shade
gathered
about
us
.
<EOS>
After
a
space
,
breathless
and
spent
in
prayer
,
a
penitent
approached
the
confessional
.
<EOS>
I
watched
.
<EOS>
She
whispered
her
avowal
;
her
shrift
was
whispered
back
;
she
returned
consoled
.
<EOS>
Another
went
,
and
another
.
<EOS>
A
pale
lady
,
kneeling
near
me
,
said
in
a
low
,
kind
voice
:
 
<EOS>
"
Go
you
now
,
I
am
not
quite
prepared
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mechanically
obedient
,
I
rose
and
went
.
<EOS>
I
knew
what
I
was
about
;
my
mind
had
run
over
the
intent
with
lightning
-
speed
.
<EOS>
To
take
this
step
could
not
make
me
more
wretched
than
I
was
;
it
might
soothe
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
priest
within
the
confessional
never
turned
his
eyes
to
regard
me
;
he
only
quietly
inclined
his
ear
to
my
lips
.
<EOS>
He
might
be
a
good
man
,
but
this
duty
had
become
to
him
a
sort
of
form
:
he
went
through
it
with
the
phlegm
of
custom
.
<EOS>
I
hesitated
;
of
the
formula
of
confession
<EOS>
I
was
ignorant
:
instead
of
commencing
,
then
,
with
the
prelude
usual
,
I
said
:
 
"
Mon
père
,
je
suis
Protestante
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
directly
turned
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
native
priest
:
of
that
class
,
the
cast
of
physiognomy
is
,
almost
invariably
,
grovelling
:
<EOS>
I
saw
by
his
profile
and
brow
<EOS>
he
was
a
Frenchman
;
though
grey
and
advanced
in
years
,
he
did
not
,
I
think
,
lack
feeling
or
intelligence
.
<EOS>
He
inquired
,
not
unkindly
,
why
,
being
a
Protestant
,
I
came
to
him
?
  
<EOS>
I
said
I
was
perishing
for
a
word
of
advice
or
an
accent
of
comfort
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
living
for
some
weeks
quite
alone
;
I
had
been
ill
;
I
had
a
pressure
of
affliction
on
my
mind
of
which
it
would
hardly
any
longer
endure
the
weight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
a
sin
,
a
crime
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
,
somewhat
startled
.
<EOS>
I
reassured
him
on
this
point
,
and
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
I
showed
him
the
mere
outline
of
my
experience
.
  
<EOS>
He
looked
thoughtful
,
surprised
,
puzzled
.
<EOS>
"
You
take
me
unawares
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
had
such
a
case
as
yours
before
:
ordinarily
we
know
our
routine
,
and
are
prepared
;
but
this
makes
a
great
break
in
the
common
course
of
confession
.
<EOS>
I
am
hardly
furnished
with
counsel
fitting
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
had
not
expected
he
would
be
;
but
the
mere
relief
of
communication
in
an
ear
which
was
human
and
sentient
,
yet
consecrated
 
the
mere
pouring
out
of
some
portion
of
long
accumulating
,
long
pent
-
up
pain
into
a
vessel
whence
it
could
not
be
again
diffused
 
had
done
me
good
.
<EOS>
I
was
already
solaced
.
  
<EOS>
"
Must
I
go
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
of
him
as
he
sat
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
daughter
,
"
he
said
kindly
 
<EOS>
and
I
am
sure
he
was
a
kind
man
:
he
had
a
compassionate
eye
 
"
for
the
present
you
had
better
go
:
<EOS>
but
I
assure
you
your
words
have
struck
me
.
<EOS>
Confession
,
like
other
things
,
is
apt
to
become
formal
and
trivial
with
habit
.
<EOS>
You
have
come
and
poured
your
heart
out
;
a
thing
seldom
done
.
<EOS>
I
would
fain
think
your
case
over
,
and
take
it
with
me
to
my
oratory
.
<EOS>
Were
you
of
our
faith
I
should
know
what
to
say
 
a
mind
so
tossed
can
find
repose
but
in
the
bosom
of
retreat
,
and
the
punctual
practice
of
piety
.
<EOS>
The
world
,
it
is
well
known
,
has
no
satisfaction
for
that
class
of
natures
.
<EOS>
Holy
men
have
bidden
penitents
like
you
to
hasten
their
path
upward
by
penance
,
self
-
denial
,
and
difficult
good
works
.
<EOS>
Tears
are
given
them
here
for
meat
and
drink
 
bread
of
affliction
and
waters
of
affliction
 
<EOS>
their
recompence
comes
hereafter
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
own
conviction
that
these
impressions
under
which
you
are
smarting
are
messengers
from
God
to
bring
you
back
to
the
true
Church
.
<EOS>
You
were
made
for
our
faith
:
depend
upon
it
our
faith
alone
could
heal
and
help
you
 
Protestantism
is
altogether
too
dry
,
cold
,
prosaic
for
you
.
<EOS>
The
further
I
look
into
this
matter
,
<EOS>
the
more
plainly
I
see
it
is
entirely
out
of
the
common
order
of
things
.
<EOS>
On
no
account
would
I
lose
sight
of
you
.
<EOS>
Go
,
my
daughter
,
for
the
present
;
but
return
to
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
rose
and
thanked
him
.
<EOS>
I
was
withdrawing
when
he
signed
me
to
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
come
to
this
church
,
"
said
he
:
"
<EOS>
I
see
you
are
ill
,
and
this
church
is
too
cold
;
you
must
come
to
my
house
:
<EOS>
I
live
 
"
<EOS>
(
and
he
gave
me
his
address
)
.
<EOS>
"
Be
there
to
-
morrow
morning
at
ten
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
reply
to
this
appointment
,
I
only
bowed
;
and
pulling
down
my
veil
,
and
gathering
round
me
my
cloak
,
I
glided
away
.
  
<EOS>
Did
I
,
do
you
suppose
,
reader
,
contemplate
venturing
again
within
that
worthy
priest
's
reach
?
<EOS>
As
soon
should
I
have
thought
of
walking
into
a
Babylonish
furnace
.
<EOS>
That
priest
had
arms
which
could
influence
me
:
he
was
naturally
kind
,
with
a
sentimental
French
kindness
,
to
whose
softness
I
knew
myself
not
wholly
impervious
.
<EOS>
Without
respecting
some
sorts
of
affection
,
there
was
hardly
any
sort
having
a
fibre
of
root
in
reality
,
which
I
could
rely
on
my
force
wholly
to
withstand
.
<EOS>
Had
I
gone
to
him
,
he
would
have
shown
me
all
that
was
tender
,
and
comforting
,
and
gentle
,
in
the
honest
Popish
superstition
.
<EOS>
Then
he
would
have
tried
to
kindle
,
blow
and
stir
up
in
me
the
zeal
of
good
works
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
it
would
all
have
ended
.
<EOS>
We
all
think
ourselves
strong
in
some
points
;
we
all
know
ourselves
weak
in
many
;
the
probabilities
are
that
had
I
visited
Numero
10
,
Rue
des
Mages
,
at
the
hour
and
day
appointed
,
I
might
just
now
,
instead
of
writing
this
heretic
narrative
,
be
counting
my
beads
in
the
cell
of
a
certain
Carmelite
convent
on
the
Boulevard
of
Crécy
,
in
Villette
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
of
Fénélon
about
that
benign
old
priest
;
and
whatever
most
of
his
brethren
may
be
,
and
whatever
I
may
think
of
his
Church
and
creed
(
and
I
like
neither
)
,
of
himself
I
must
ever
retain
a
grateful
recollection
.
<EOS>
He
was
kind
when
I
needed
kindness
;
he
did
me
good
.
<EOS>
May
Heaven
bless
him
!
  
<EOS>
Twilight
had
passed
into
night
,
and
the
lamps
were
lit
in
the
streets
ere
<EOS>
I
issued
from
that
sombre
church
.
<EOS>
To
turn
back
was
now
become
possible
to
me
;
the
wild
longing
to
breathe
this
October
wind
on
the
little
hill
far
without
the
city
walls
had
ceased
to
be
an
imperative
impulse
,
and
was
softened
into
a
wish
with
which
Reason
could
cope
:
she
put
it
down
,
and
I
turned
,
as
I
thought
,
to
the
Rue
Fossette
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
become
involved
in
a
part
of
the
city
with
which
I
was
not
familiar
;
it
was
the
old
part
,
and
full
of
narrow
streets
of
picturesque
,
ancient
,
and
mouldering
houses
.
<EOS>
I
was
much
too
weak
to
be
very
collected
,
and
I
was
still
too
careless
of
my
own
welfare
and
safety
to
be
cautious
;
I
grew
embarrassed
;
I
got
immeshed
in
a
network
of
turns
unknown
.
<EOS>
I
was
lost
and
had
no
resolution
to
ask
guidance
of
any
passenger
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
storm
had
lulled
a
little
at
sunset
,
it
made
up
now
for
lost
time
.
<EOS>
Strong
and
horizontal
thundered
the
current
of
the
wind
from
north
-
west
to
south
-
east
;
it
brought
rain
like
spray
,
and
sometimes
a
sharp
hail
,
like
shot
:
it
was
cold
and
pierced
me
to
the
vitals
.
<EOS>
I
bent
my
head
to
meet
it
,
but
it
beat
me
back
.
<EOS>
My
heart
did
not
fail
at
all
in
this
conflict
;
I
only
wished
that
I
had
wings
and
could
ascend
the
gale
,
spread
and
repose
my
pinions
on
its
strength
,
career
in
its
course
,
sweep
where
it
swept
.
<EOS>
While
wishing
this
,
I
suddenly
felt
colder
where
before
I
was
cold
,
and
more
powerless
where
before
I
was
weak
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
reach
the
porch
of
a
great
building
near
,
but
the
mass
of
frontage
and
the
giant
spire
turned
black
and
vanished
from
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
sinking
on
the
steps
as
I
intended
,
I
seemed
to
pitch
headlong
down
an
abyss
.
<EOS>
I
remember
no
more
.
    
<EOS>
AULD
LANG
SYNE
.
  
<EOS>
Where
my
soul
went
during
that
swoon
I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
Whatever
she
saw
,
or
wherever
she
travelled
in
her
trance
on
that
strange
night
she
kept
her
own
secret
;
never
whispering
a
word
to
Memory
,
and
baffling
imagination
by
an
indissoluble
silence
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
gone
upward
,
and
come
in
sight
of
her
eternal
home
,
hoping
for
leave
to
rest
now
,
and
deeming
that
her
painful
union
with
matter
was
at
last
dissolved
.
<EOS>
While
she
so
deemed
,
an
angel
may
have
warned
her
away
from
heaven
's
threshold
,
and
,
guiding
her
weeping
down
,
have
bound
her
,
once
more
,
all
shuddering
and
unwilling
,
to
that
poor
frame
,
cold
and
wasted
,
of
whose
companionship
she
was
grown
more
than
weary
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
she
re
-
entered
her
prison
with
pain
,
with
reluctance
,
with
a
moan
and
a
long
shiver
.
<EOS>
The
divorced
mates
,
Spirit
and
Substance
,
were
hard
to
re
-
unite
:
they
greeted
each
other
,
not
in
an
embrace
,
but
a
racking
sort
of
struggle
.
<EOS>
The
returning
sense
of
sight
came
upon
me
,
red
,
as
if
it
swam
in
blood
;
suspended
hearing
rushed
back
loud
,
like
thunder
;
consciousness
revived
in
fear
:
I
sat
up
appalled
,
wondering
into
what
region
,
amongst
what
strange
beings
I
was
waking
.
<EOS>
At
first
I
knew
nothing
I
looked
on
:
a
wall
was
not
a
wall
 
<EOS>
a
lamp
not
a
lamp
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
understood
what
we
call
a
ghost
,
as
well
as
I
did
the
commonest
object
:
which
is
another
way
of
intimating
that
all
my
eye
rested
on
struck
it
as
spectral
.
<EOS>
But
the
faculties
soon
settled
each
in
his
place
;
the
life
-
machine
presently
resumed
its
wonted
and
regular
working
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
I
knew
not
where
I
was
;
only
in
time
I
saw
I
had
been
removed
from
the
spot
where
I
fell
:
I
lay
on
no
portico
-
step
;
night
and
tempest
were
excluded
by
walls
,
windows
,
and
ceiling
.
<EOS>
Into
some
house
I
had
been
carried
 
but
<EOS>
what
house
?
  
<EOS>
I
could
only
think
of
the
pensionnat
in
the
Rue
Fossette
.
<EOS>
Still
half
-
dreaming
,
I
tried
hard
to
discover
in
what
room
they
had
put
me
;
whether
the
great
dormitory
,
or
one
of
the
little
dormitories
.
<EOS>
I
was
puzzled
,
because
I
could
not
make
the
glimpses
of
furniture
I
saw
accord
with
my
knowledge
of
any
of
these
apartments
.
<EOS>
The
empty
white
beds
were
wanting
,
and
the
long
line
of
large
windows
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Surely
,
"
thought
I
,
"
it
is
not
to
Madame
Beck
's
own
chamber
they
have
carried
me
!
"
<EOS>
And
here
my
eye
fell
on
an
easy
-
chair
covered
with
blue
damask
.
<EOS>
Other
seats
,
cushioned
to
match
,
dawned
on
me
by
degrees
;
and
at
last
I
took
in
the
complete
fact
of
a
pleasant
parlour
,
with
a
wood
fire
on
a
clear
-
shining
hearth
,
a
carpet
where
arabesques
of
bright
blue
relieved
a
ground
of
shaded
fawn
;
pale
walls
over
which
a
slight
but
endless
garland
of
azure
forget
-
me
-
nots
ran
mazed
and
bewildered
amongst
myriad
gold
leaves
and
tendrils
.
<EOS>
A
gilded
mirror
filled
up
the
space
between
two
windows
,
curtained
amply
with
blue
damask
.
<EOS>
In
this
mirror
I
saw
myself
laid
,
not
in
bed
,
but
on
a
sofa
.
<EOS>
I
looked
spectral
;
my
eyes
larger
and
more
hollow
,
my
hair
<EOS>
darker
than
was
natural
,
by
contrast
with
my
thin
and
ashen
face
.
<EOS>
It
was
obvious
,
not
only
from
the
furniture
,
but
from
the
position
of
windows
,
doors
,
and
fireplace
,
that
this
was
an
unknown
room
in
an
unknown
house
.
  
<EOS>
Hardly
less
plain
was
it
that
my
brain
was
not
yet
settled
;
for
,
as
I
gazed
at
the
blue
arm
-
chair
,
it
appeared
to
grow
familiar
;
so
did
a
certain
scroll
-
couch
,
and
<EOS>
not
less
so
the
round
centre
-
table
,
with
a
blue
-
covering
,
bordered
with
autumn
-
tinted
foliage
;
and
,
above
all
,
two
little
footstools
with
worked
covers
,
and
a
small
ebony
-
framed
chair
,
of
which
the
seat
and
back
were
also
worked
with
groups
of
brilliant
flowers
on
a
dark
ground
.
  
<EOS>
Struck
with
these
things
,
I
explored
further
.
<EOS>
Strange
to
say
,
old
acquaintance
were
all
about
me
,
and
"
auld
lang
syne
"
smiled
out
of
every
nook
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
oval
miniatures
over
the
mantel
-
piece
,
of
which
I
knew
by
heart
the
pearls
about
the
high
and
powdered
"
heads
;
"
the
velvets
circling
the
white
throats
;
the
swell
of
the
full
muslin
kerchiefs
:
the
pattern
of
the
lace
sleeve
-
ruffles
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
mantel
-
shelf
there
were
two
china
vases
,
some
relics
of
a
diminutive
tea
-
service
,
as
smooth
as
enamel
and
as
thin
as
egg
-
shell
,
and
a
white
centre
ornament
,
a
classic
group
in
alabaster
,
preserved
under
glass
.
<EOS>
Of
all
these
things
I
could
have
told
the
peculiarities
,
numbered
the
flaws
or
cracks
,
like
any
_
clairvoyante
_
.
<EOS>
Above
all
,
there
was
a
pair
of
handscreens
,
with
elaborate
pencil
-
drawings
finished
like
line
engravings
;
these
,
my
very
eyes
ached
at
beholding
again
,
recalling
hours
when
they
had
followed
,
stroke
by
stroke
and
touch
by
touch
,
a
tedious
,
feeble
,
finical
,
school
-
girl
pencil
held
in
these
fingers
,
now
so
skeleton
-
like
.
  
<EOS>
Where
was
I
?
<EOS>
Not
only
in
what
spot
of
the
world
,
but
in
what
year
of
our
Lord
?
<EOS>
For
all
these
objects
were
of
past
days
,
and
of
a
distant
country
.
<EOS>
Ten
years
ago
I
bade
them
good
-
by
;
since
my
fourteenth
year
they
and
I
had
never
met
.
<EOS>
I
gasped
audibly
,
"
<EOS>
Where
am
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
shape
hitherto
unnoticed
,
stirred
,
rose
,
came
forward
:
a
shape
inharmonious
with
the
environment
,
serving
only
to
complicate
the
riddle
further
.
<EOS>
This
was
no
more
than
a
sort
of
native
bonne
,
in
a
common
-
place
bonne
's
cap
and
print
-
dress
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
neither
French
nor
English
,
and
I
could
get
no
intelligence
from
her
,
not
understanding
her
phrases
of
dialect
.
<EOS>
But
she
bathed
my
temples
and
forehead
with
some
cool
and
perfumed
water
,
and
then
she
heightened
the
cushion
on
which
I
reclined
,
made
signs
that
I
was
not
to
speak
,
and
resumed
her
post
at
the
foot
of
the
sofa
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
busy
knitting
;
her
eyes
thus
drawn
from
me
,
I
could
gaze
on
her
without
interruption
.
<EOS>
I
did
mightily
wonder
how
she
came
there
,
or
what
she
could
have
to
do
among
the
scenes
,
or
with
the
days
of
my
girlhood
.
<EOS>
Still
more
I
marvelled
what
those
scenes
and
days
could
now
have
to
do
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
Too
weak
to
scrutinize
thoroughly
the
mystery
,
I
tried
to
settle
it
by
saying
it
was
a
mistake
,
a
dream
,
a
fever
-
fit
;
and
yet
I
knew
there
could
be
no
mistake
,
and
that
I
was
not
sleeping
,
and
I
believed
I
was
sane
.
<EOS>
I
wished
the
room
had
not
been
so
well
lighted
,
that
I
might
not
so
clearly
have
seen
the
little
pictures
,
the
ornaments
,
the
screens
,
the
worked
chair
.
<EOS>
All
these
objects
,
as
well
as
the
blue
-
damask
furniture
,
were
,
in
fact
,
precisely
the
same
,
in
every
minutest
detail
,
with
those
I
so
well
remembered
,
and
with
which
I
had
been
so
thoroughly
intimate
,
in
the
drawing
-
room
of
my
godmother
's
house
at
Bretton
.
<EOS>
Methought
the
apartment
only
was
changed
,
being
of
different
proportions
and
dimensions
.
  
<EOS>
I
thought
of
Bedreddin
Hassan
,
transported
in
his
sleep
from
Cairo
to
the
gates
of
Damascus
.
<EOS>
Had
a
Genius
stooped
his
dark
wing
down
the
storm
to
whose
stress
I
had
succumbed
,
and
gathering
me
from
the
church
-
steps
,
and
"
rising
high
into
the
air
,
"
as
the
eastern
tale
said
,
<EOS>
had
he
borne
me
over
land
and
ocean
,
and
laid
me
quietly
down
beside
a
hearth
of
Old
England
?
<EOS>
But
no
<EOS>
;
I
knew
the
fire
of
that
hearth
burned
before
its
Lares
no
more
 
<EOS>
it
went
out
long
ago
,
and
the
household
gods
had
been
carried
elsewhere
.
  
<EOS>
The
bonne
turned
again
to
survey
me
,
and
seeing
my
eyes
wide
open
,
and
,
I
suppose
,
deeming
their
expression
perturbed
and
excited
,
she
put
down
her
knitting
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
busied
for
a
moment
at
a
little
stand
;
she
poured
out
water
,
and
measured
drops
from
a
phial
:
glass
in
hand
,
she
approached
me
.
<EOS>
What
dark
-
tinged
draught
might
she
now
be
offering
?
<EOS>
what
Genii
-
elixir
or
Magi
-
distillation
?
  
<EOS>
It
was
too
late
to
inquire
 
<EOS>
I
had
swallowed
it
passively
,
and
at
once
.
<EOS>
A
tide
of
quiet
thought
now
came
gently
caressing
my
brain
;
softer
and
softer
rose
the
flow
,
with
tepid
undulations
smoother
than
balm
.
<EOS>
The
pain
of
weakness
left
my
limbs
,
my
muscles
slept
.
<EOS>
I
lost
power
to
move
;
but
,
losing
at
the
same
time
wish
,
it
was
no
privation
.
<EOS>
That
kind
bonne
placed
a
screen
between
me
and
the
lamp
;
I
saw
her
rise
to
do
this
,
but
do
not
remember
seeing
her
resume
her
place
:
in
the
interval
between
the
two
acts
,
I
"
fell
on
sleep
.
"
     
<EOS>
At
waking
,
lo
!
<EOS>
all
was
again
changed
.
<EOS>
The
light
of
high
day
surrounded
me
;
not
,
indeed
,
a
warm
,
summer
light
,
but
the
leaden
gloom
of
raw
and
blustering
autumn
.
<EOS>
I
felt
sure
now
that
I
was
in
the
pensionnat
 
sure
by
the
beating
rain
on
the
casement
;
sure
by
the
"
wuther
"
of
wind
amongst
trees
,
denoting
a
garden
outside
;
sure
by
the
chill
,
the
whiteness
,
the
solitude
,
amidst
which
I
lay
.
<EOS>
I
say
_
whiteness
<EOS>
_
 
for
the
dimity
curtains
,
dropped
before
a
French
bed
,
bounded
my
view
.
  
<EOS>
I
lifted
them
;
I
looked
out
.
<EOS>
My
eye
,
prepared
to
take
in
the
range
of
a
long
,
large
,
and
whitewashed
chamber
,
blinked
baffled
,
on
encountering
the
limited
area
of
a
small
cabinet
 
a
cabinet
with
seagreen
walls
;
also
,
instead
of
five
wide
and
naked
windows
,
there
was
one
high
lattice
,
shaded
with
muslin
festoons
:
<EOS>
instead
of
two
dozen
little
stands
of
painted
wood
,
each
holding
a
basin
and
an
ewer
,
there
was
a
toilette
-
table
dressed
,
like
a
lady
for
a
ball
,
in
a
white
robe
over
a
pink
skirt
;
a
polished
and
large
glass
crowned
,
and
a
pretty
pin
-
cushion
frilled
with
lace
,
adorned
it
.
<EOS>
This
toilette
,
together
with
a
small
,
low
,
green
and
white
chintz
arm
-
chair
,
a
washstand
topped
with
a
marble
slab
,
and
supplied
with
utensils
of
pale
greenware
,
sufficiently
furnished
the
tiny
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
Reader
;
I
felt
alarmed
!
<EOS>
Why
?
<EOS>
you
will
ask
.
<EOS>
What
was
there
in
this
simple
and
somewhat
pretty
sleeping
-
closet
to
startle
the
most
timid
?
<EOS>
Merely
this
 
<EOS>
These
articles
of
furniture
could
not
be
real
,
solid
arm
-
chairs
,
looking
-
glasses
,
and
washstands
 
<EOS>
they
must
be
the
ghosts
of
such
articles
;
or
,
if
this
were
denied
as
too
wild
an
hypothesis
 
and
,
confounded
as
I
was
,
I
_
did
_
deny
it
 
<EOS>
there
remained
but
to
conclude
that
I
had
myself
passed
into
an
abnormal
state
of
mind
;
in
short
,
that
I
was
very
ill
and
delirious
:
and
even
then
,
mine
was
the
strangest
figment
with
which
delirium
had
ever
harassed
a
victim
.
  
<EOS>
I
knew
 
I
was
obliged
to
know
 
the
green
chintz
of
that
little
chair
;
the
little
snug
chair
itself
,
the
carved
,
shining
-
black
,
foliated
frame
of
that
glass
;
the
smooth
,
milky
-
green
of
the
china
vessels
on
the
stand
;
the
very
stand
too
,
with
its
top
of
grey
marble
,
splintered
at
one
corner
;
 
all
these
I
was
compelled
to
recognise
and
to
hail
,
as
last
night
I
had
,
perforce
,
recognised
and
hailed
the
rosewood
,
the
drapery
,
the
porcelain
,
of
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Bretton
!
<EOS>
Bretton
!
<EOS>
and
ten
years
ago
shone
reflected
in
that
mirror
.
<EOS>
And
why
did
Bretton
and
my
fourteenth
year
haunt
me
thus
?
<EOS>
Why
,
if
they
came
at
all
,
did
they
not
return
complete
?
<EOS>
Why
hovered
before
my
distempered
vision
the
mere
furniture
,
while
the
rooms
and
the
locality
were
gone
?
<EOS>
As
to
that
pincushion
made
of
crimson
satin
,
ornamented
with
gold
beads
and
frilled
with
thread
-
lace
,
I
had
the
same
right
to
know
it
as
to
know
the
screens
 
<EOS>
I
had
made
it
myself
.
<EOS>
Rising
with
a
start
from
the
bed
,
I
took
the
cushion
in
my
hand
and
examined
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
cipher
"
L.
L.
B.
"
formed
in
gold
beds
,
and
surrounded
with
an
oval
wreath
embroidered
in
white
silk
.
<EOS>
These
were
the
initials
of
my
godmother
's
name
 
Lonisa
Lucy
Bretton
.
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
in
England
?
<EOS>
Am
I
at
Bretton
?
<EOS>
"
I
muttered
;
and
hastily
pulling
up
the
blind
with
which
the
lattice
was
shrouded
,
I
looked
out
to
try
and
discover
_
where
_
<EOS>
I
was
;
half
-
prepared
to
meet
the
calm
,
old
,
handsome
buildings
and
clean
grey
pavement
of
St.
Ann
's
Street
,
and
to
see
at
the
end
the
towers
of
the
minster
:
<EOS>
or
,
if
otherwise
,
fully
expectant
of
a
town
view
somewhere
,
a
rue
in
Villette
,
if
not
a
street
in
a
pleasant
and
ancient
English
city
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
,
on
the
contrary
,
through
a
frame
of
leafage
,
clustering
round
the
high
lattice
,
and
forth
thence
to
a
grassy
mead
-
like
level
,
a
lawn
-
terrace
with
trees
rising
from
the
lower
ground
beyond
 
high
forest
-
trees
,
such
as
I
had
not
seen
for
many
a
day
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
groaning
under
the
gale
of
October
,
and
between
their
trunks
I
traced
the
line
of
an
avenue
,
where
yellow
leaves
lay
in
heaps
and
drifts
,
or
were
whirled
singly
before
the
sweeping
west
wind
.
<EOS>
Whatever
landscape
might
lie
further
must
have
been
flat
,
and
these
tall
beeches
shut
it
out
.
<EOS>
The
place
seemed
secluded
,
and
was
to
me
quite
strange
:
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
it
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
Once
more
I
lay
down
.
<EOS>
My
bed
stood
in
a
little
alcove
;
on
turning
my
face
to
the
wall
,
the
room
with
its
bewildering
accompaniments
became
excluded
.
<EOS>
Excluded
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
For
as
I
arranged
my
position
in
this
hope
,
behold
,
on
the
green
space
between
the
divided
and
looped
-
up
curtains
,
hung
a
broad
,
gilded
picture
-
frame
enclosing
a
portrait
.
<EOS>
It
was
drawn
 
well
drawn
,
though
but
a
sketch
 
in
water
-
colours
;
a
head
,
a
boy
's
head
,
fresh
,
life
-
like
,
speaking
,
and
animated
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
a
youth
of
sixteen
,
fair
-
complexioned
,
with
sanguine
health
in
his
cheek
;
hair
long
,
not
dark
,
and
with
a
sunny
sheen
;
penetrating
eyes
,
an
arch
mouth
,
and
a
gay
smile
.
<EOS>
On
the
whole
a
most
pleasant
face
to
look
at
,
especially
for
,
those
claiming
a
right
to
that
youth
's
affections
 
parents
,
for
instance
,
or
sisters
.
<EOS>
Any
romantic
little
school
-
girl
might
almost
have
loved
it
in
its
frame
.
<EOS>
Those
eyes
looked
as
if
when
somewhat
older
they
would
flash
a
lightning
-
response
to
love
:
I
can
not
tell
whether
they
kept
in
store
the
steady
-
beaming
shine
of
faith
.
<EOS>
For
whatever
sentiment
met
him
in
form
too
facile
,
his
lips
menaced
,
beautifully
but
surely
,
caprice
and
light
esteem
.
  
<EOS>
Striving
to
take
each
new
discovery
as
quietly
as
I
could
,
I
whispered
to
myself
    
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
that
portrait
used
to
hang
in
the
breakfast
-
room
,
over
the
mantel
-
piece
:
somewhat
too
high
,
as
I
thought
.
<EOS>
I
well
remember
how
I
used
to
mount
a
music
-
stool
for
the
purpose
of
unhooking
it
,
holding
it
in
my
hand
,
and
searching
into
those
bonny
wells
of
eyes
,
whose
glance
under
their
hazel
lashes
seemed
like
a
pencilled
laugh
;
and
well
I
liked
to
note
the
colouring
of
the
cheek
,
and
the
expression
of
the
mouth
.
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
believed
fancy
could
improve
on
the
curve
of
that
mouth
,
or
of
the
chin
;
even
_
my
_
ignorance
knew
that
both
were
beautiful
,
and
pondered
perplexed
over
this
doubt
:
<EOS>
"
How
it
was
that
what
charmed
so
much
,
could
at
the
same
time
so
keenly
pain
?
"
<EOS>
Once
,
by
way
of
test
,
I
took
little
Missy
Home
,
and
,
lifting
her
in
my
arms
,
told
her
to
look
at
the
picture
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
like
it
,
Polly
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
She
never
answered
,
but
gazed
long
,
and
at
last
a
darkness
went
trembling
through
her
sensitive
eye
,
as
she
said
,
"
Put
me
down
.
"
<EOS>
So
I
put
her
down
,
saying
to
myself
:
"
The
child
feels
it
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
All
these
things
do
I
now
think
over
,
adding
,
"
He
had
his
faults
,
yet
scarce
ever
was
a
finer
nature
;
liberal
,
suave
,
impressible
.
<EOS>
"
My
reflections
closed
in
an
audibly
pronounced
word
,
"
Graham
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Graham
!
"
echoed
a
sudden
voice
at
the
bedside
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
want
Graham
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
looked
.
<EOS>
The
plot
was
but
thickening
;
the
wonder
but
culminating
.
<EOS>
If
it
was
strange
to
see
that
well
-
remembered
pictured
form
on
the
wall
,
still
stranger
was
it
to
turn
and
behold
the
equally
well
-
remembered
living
form
opposite
 
<EOS>
a
woman
,
a
lady
,
most
real
and
substantial
,
tall
,
well
-
attired
,
wearing
widow
's
silk
,
and
such
a
cap
as
best
became
her
matron
and
motherly
braids
of
hair
.
<EOS>
Hers
,
too
,
was
a
good
face
;
too
marked
,
perhaps
,
now
for
beauty
,
but
not
for
sense
or
character
.
<EOS>
She
was
little
changed
;
something
sterner
,
something
more
robust
 
<EOS>
but
she
was
my
godmother
:
still
the
distinct
vision
of
Mrs.
Bretton
.
  
<EOS>
I
kept
quiet
,
yet
internally
_
I
_
was
much
agitated
:
my
pulse
fluttered
,
and
the
blood
left
my
cheek
,
which
turned
cold
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
where
am
I
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
a
very
safe
asylum
;
well
protected
for
the
present
;
make
your
mind
quite
easy
till
you
get
a
little
better
;
you
look
ill
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
entirely
bewildered
,
I
do
not
know
whether
I
can
trust
my
senses
at
all
,
or
whether
they
are
misleading
me
in
every
particular
:
but
you
speak
English
,
do
you
not
,
madam
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
you
might
hear
that
:
it
would
puzzle
me
to
hold
a
long
discourse
in
French
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
come
from
England
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
lately
arrived
thence
.
<EOS>
Have
you
been
long
in
this
country
?
<EOS>
You
seem
to
know
my
son
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
,
I
,
madam
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
do
.
<EOS>
Your
son
 
the
picture
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
his
portrait
as
a
youth
.
<EOS>
While
looking
at
it
,
you
pronounced
his
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Graham
Bretton
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
nodded
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
speak
to
Mrs.
Bretton
,
formerly
of
Bretton
,
shire
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
;
and
you
,
I
am
told
,
are
an
English
teacher
in
a
foreign
school
here
:
my
son
recognised
you
as
such
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
was
I
found
,
madam
,
and
by
whom
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
son
shall
tell
you
that
by
-
and
-
by
,
"
said
she
;
"
but
at
present
you
are
too
confused
and
weak
for
conversation
:
try
to
eat
some
breakfast
,
and
then
sleep
.
"
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
I
had
undergone
 
the
bodily
fatigue
,
the
perturbation
of
spirits
,
the
exposure
to
weather
 
<EOS>
it
seemed
that
I
was
better
:
<EOS>
the
fever
,
the
real
malady
which
had
oppressed
my
frame
,
was
abating
;
for
,
whereas
during
the
last
nine
days
I
had
taken
no
solid
food
,
and
suffered
from
continual
thirst
,
this
morning
,
on
breakfast
being
offered
,
I
experienced
a
craving
for
nourishment
:
an
inward
faintness
which
caused
me
eagerly
to
taste
the
tea
this
lady
offered
,
and
to
eat
the
morsel
of
dry
toast
she
allowed
in
accompaniment
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
a
morsel
,
but
it
sufficed
;
keeping
up
my
strength
till
some
two
or
three
hours
afterwards
,
when
the
bonne
brought
me
a
little
cup
of
broth
and
a
biscuit
.
  
<EOS>
As
evening
began
to
darken
,
and
the
ceaseless
blast
still
blew
wild
and
cold
,
and
the
rain
streamed
on
,
deluge
-
like
<EOS>
,
I
grew
weary
 
very
weary
of
my
bed
.
<EOS>
The
room
,
though
pretty
,
was
small
:
I
felt
it
confining
:
I
longed
for
a
change
.
<EOS>
The
increasing
chill
and
gathering
gloom
,
too
,
depressed
me
;
I
wanted
to
see
 
to
feel
firelight
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
kept
thinking
of
the
son
of
that
tall
matron
:
when
should
I
see
him
?
<EOS>
Certainly
not
till
I
left
my
room
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
the
bonne
came
to
make
my
bed
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
She
prepared
to
wrap
me
in
a
blanket
and
place
me
in
the
little
chintz
chair
;
but
,
declining
these
attentions
,
I
proceeded
to
dress
myself
:
  
<EOS>
The
business
was
just
achieved
,
and
I
was
sitting
down
to
take
breath
,
when
Mrs.
Bretton
once
more
appeared
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dressed
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
smiling
with
that
smile
<EOS>
I
so
well
knew
 
a
pleasant
smile
,
though
not
soft
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
better
then
?
<EOS>
Quite
strong
 
eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
spoke
to
me
so
much
as
of
old
she
used
to
speak
that
I
almost
fancied
she
was
beginning
to
know
me
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
same
sort
of
patronage
in
her
voice
and
manner
that
,
as
a
girl
,
I
had
always
experienced
from
her
 
a
patronage
I
yielded
to
and
even
liked
;
it
was
not
founded
on
conventional
grounds
of
superior
wealth
or
station
(
in
the
last
particular
there
had
never
been
any
inequality
;
her
degree
was
mine
)
;
but
on
natural
reasons
of
physical
advantage
:
it
was
the
shelter
the
tree
gives
the
herb
.
<EOS>
I
put
a
request
without
further
ceremony
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
let
me
go
down
-
stairs
,
madam
;
I
am
so
cold
and
dull
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
desire
nothing
better
,
if
you
are
strong
enough
to
bear
the
change
,
"
was
her
reply
.
<EOS>
"
Come
then
;
here
is
an
arm
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
offered
me
hers
<EOS>
:
I
took
it
,
and
we
descended
one
flight
of
carpeted
steps
to
a
landing
where
a
tall
door
,
standing
open
,
gave
admission
into
the
blue
-
damask
room
.
<EOS>
How
pleasant
it
was
in
its
air
of
perfect
domestic
comfort
!
<EOS>
How
warm
in
its
amber
lamp
-
light
and
vermilion
fire
-
flush
!
<EOS>
To
render
the
picture
perfect
,
tea
stood
ready
on
the
table
 
an
English
tea
,
whereof
the
whole
shining
service
glanced
at
me
familiarly
;
from
the
solid
silver
urn
,
of
antique
pattern
,
and
the
massive
pot
of
the
same
metal
,
to
the
thin
porcelain
cups
,
dark
with
purple
and
gilding
.
<EOS>
I
knew
the
very
seed
-
cake
of
peculiar
form
,
baked
in
a
peculiar
mould
,
which
always
had
a
place
on
the
tea
-
table
at
Bretton
.
<EOS>
Graham
liked
it
,
and
there
it
was
as
of
yore
 
set
before
Graham
's
plate
with
the
silver
knife
and
fork
beside
it
.
<EOS>
Graham
was
then
expected
to
tea
:
<EOS>
Graham
was
now
,
perhaps
,
in
the
house
;
ere
many
minutes
I
might
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
 
sit
down
,
"
said
my
conductress
,
as
my
step
faltered
a
little
in
passing
to
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
She
seated
me
on
the
sofa
,
but
I
soon
passed
behind
it
,
saying
the
fire
was
too
hot
;
in
its
shade
I
found
another
seat
which
suited
me
better
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
was
never
wo
nt
to
make
a
fuss
about
any
person
or
anything
;
without
remonstrance
she
suffered
me
to
have
my
own
way
.
<EOS>
She
made
the
tea
,
and
she
took
up
the
newspaper
.
<EOS>
I
liked
to
watch
every
action
of
my
godmother
;
all
her
movements
were
so
young
:
she
must
have
been
now
above
fifty
,
yet
neither
her
sinews
nor
her
spirit
seemed
yet
touched
by
the
rust
of
age
.
<EOS>
Though
portly
,
she
was
alert
,
and
though
serene
,
she
was
at
times
impetuous
 
<EOS>
good
health
and
an
excellent
temperament
kept
her
green
as
in
her
spring
.
  
<EOS>
While
she
read
,
I
perceived
she
listened
 
listened
for
her
son
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
the
woman
ever
to
confess
herself
uneasy
,
but
there
was
yet
no
lull
in
the
weather
,
and
if
Graham
were
out
in
that
hoarse
wind
 
<EOS>
roaring
still
unsatisfied
 
<EOS>
I
well
knew
his
mother
's
heart
would
be
out
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ten
minutes
behind
his
time
,
"
said
she
,
looking
at
her
watch
;
then
,
in
another
minute
,
a
lifting
of
her
eyes
from
the
page
,
and
a
slight
inclination
of
her
head
towards
the
door
,
denoted
that
she
heard
some
sound
.
<EOS>
Presently
her
brow
cleared
;
and
then
even
my
ear
,
less
practised
,
caught
the
iron
clash
of
a
gate
swung
to
<EOS>
,
steps
on
gravel
,
lastly
the
door
-
bell
.
<EOS>
He
was
come
.
<EOS>
His
mother
filled
the
teapot
from
the
urn
,
she
drew
nearer
the
hearth
<EOS>
the
stuffed
and
cushioned
blue
chair
 
<EOS>
her
own
chair
by
right
,
<EOS>
but
I
saw
there
was
one
who
might
with
impunity
<EOS>
usurp
it
.
<EOS>
And
when
that
_
one
_
came
up
the
stairs
 
which
he
soon
did
,
after
,
I
suppose
,
some
such
attention
to
the
toilet
as
the
wild
and
wet
night
rendered
necessary
,
and
strode
straight
in
    
<EOS>
"
Is
it
you
,
Graham
?
"
said
his
mother
,
hiding
a
glad
smile
and
speaking
curtly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
else
should
it
be
,
mamma
?
"
<EOS>
demanded
the
Unpunctual
,
possessing
himself
irreverently
of
the
abdicated
throne
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
deserve
cold
tea
,
for
being
late
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
get
my
deserts
,
for
the
urn
sings
cheerily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wheel
yourself
to
the
table
,
lazy
boy
:
<EOS>
no
seat
will
serve
you
but
mine
;
if
you
had
one
spark
of
a
sense
of
propriety
,
you
would
always
leave
that
chair
for
the
Old
Lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
should
;
only
the
dear
Old
Lady
persists
in
leaving
it
for
me
.
<EOS>
How
is
your
patient
,
mamma
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
she
come
forward
and
speak
for
herself
?
"
said
Mrs.
Bretton
,
turning
to
my
corner
;
and
at
this
invitation
,
forward
I
came
.
<EOS>
Graham
courteously
rose
up
to
greet
me
.
<EOS>
He
stood
tall
on
the
hearth
,
a
figure
justifying
his
mother
's
unconcealed
pride
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
are
come
down
,
"
said
he
;
"
you
must
be
better
then
 
much
better
.
<EOS>
I
scarcely
expected
we
should
meet
thus
,
or
here
.
<EOS>
I
was
alarmed
last
night
,
and
if
I
had
not
been
forced
to
hurry
away
to
a
dying
patient
,
I
certainly
would
not
have
left
you
;
but
my
mother
herself
is
something
of
a
doctress
,
and
Martha
an
excellent
nurse
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
case
was
a
fainting
-
fit
,
not
necessarily
dangerous
.
<EOS>
What
brought
it
on
,
I
have
yet
to
learn
,
and
all
particulars
;
meantime
,
I
trust
you
really
do
feel
better
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Much
better
,
"
I
said
calmly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Much
better
,
I
thank
you
,
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
For
,
reader
,
this
tall
young
man
 
<EOS>
this
darling
son
 
<EOS>
this
host
of
mine
 
<EOS>
this
Graham
Bretton
,
_
was
_
<EOS>
Dr.
John
:
he
,
and
no
other
;
and
<EOS>
,
what
is
more
,
I
ascertained
this
identity
scarcely
with
surprise
.
<EOS>
What
is
more
,
when
I
heard
Graham
's
step
on
the
stairs
,
I
knew
what
manner
of
figure
would
enter
,
and
for
whose
aspect
to
prepare
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
discovery
was
not
of
to
-
day
,
its
dawn
had
penetrated
my
perceptions
long
since
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
remembered
young
Bretton
well
;
and
though
ten
years
(
from
sixteen
to
twenty
-
six
)
may
greatly
change
the
boy
as
they
mature
him
to
the
man
,
yet
they
could
bring
no
such
utter
difference
as
would
suffice
wholly
to
blind
my
eyes
,
or
baffle
my
memory
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
Graham
Bretton
retained
still
an
affinity
to
the
youth
of
sixteen
:
he
had
his
eyes
;
he
had
some
of
his
features
;
to
wit
,
all
the
excellently
-
moulded
lower
half
of
the
face
;
I
found
him
out
soon
.
<EOS>
I
first
recognised
him
on
that
occasion
,
noted
several
chapters
back
,
when
my
unguardedly
-
fixed
attention
had
drawn
on
me
the
mortification
of
an
implied
rebuke
.
<EOS>
Subsequent
observation
confirmed
,
in
every
point
,
that
early
surmise
.
<EOS>
I
traced
in
the
gesture
,
the
port
,
and
the
habits
of
his
manhood
,
all
his
boy
's
promise
.
<EOS>
I
heard
in
his
now
deep
tones
the
accent
of
former
days
.
<EOS>
Certain
turns
of
phrase
,
peculiar
to
him
of
old
,
were
peculiar
to
him
still
;
and
so
was
many
a
trick
of
eye
and
lip
,
<EOS>
many
a
smile
,
many
a
sudden
ray
levelled
from
the
irid
,
under
his
well
-
charactered
brow
.
  
<EOS>
To
_
say
_
anything
on
the
subject
,
to
_
hint
_
<EOS>
at
my
discovery
,
had
not
suited
my
habits
of
thought
,
or
assimilated
with
my
system
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
I
had
preferred
to
keep
the
matter
to
myself
.
<EOS>
I
liked
entering
his
presence
covered
with
a
cloud
he
had
not
seen
through
,
while
he
stood
before
me
under
a
ray
of
special
illumination
which
shone
all
partial
over
his
head
,
trembled
about
his
feet
,
and
cast
light
no
farther
.
  
<EOS>
Well
I
knew
that
to
him
it
could
make
little
difference
,
were
I
to
come
forward
and
announce
,
"
This
is
Lucy
Snowe
!
"
<EOS>
So
I
kept
back
in
my
teacher
's
place
;
and
as
he
never
asked
my
name
,
so
I
never
gave
it
.
<EOS>
He
heard
me
called
"
Miss
,
"
and
"
Miss
Lucy
;
"
he
never
heard
the
surname
,
"
Snowe
.
"
<EOS>
As
to
spontaneous
recognition
 
though
I
,
perhaps
,
was
still
less
changed
than
he
 
<EOS>
the
idea
never
approached
his
mind
,
and
why
should
I
suggest
it
?
  
<EOS>
During
tea
,
Dr.
John
was
kind
,
as
it
was
his
nature
to
be
;
that
meal
over
,
and
the
tray
carried
out
,
he
made
a
cosy
arrangement
of
the
cushions
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
,
and
obliged
me
to
settle
amongst
them
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
mother
also
drew
to
the
fire
,
and
ere
<EOS>
we
had
sat
ten
minutes
<EOS>
,
I
caught
the
eye
of
the
latter
fastened
steadily
upon
me
.
<EOS>
Women
are
certainly
quicker
in
some
things
than
men
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
she
exclaimed
,
presently
,
"
I
have
seldom
seen
a
stronger
likeness
!
<EOS>
Graham
,
have
you
observed
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Observed
what
?
<EOS>
What
ails
the
Old
Lady
now
?
<EOS>
How
you
stare
,
mamma
!
<EOS>
One
would
think
you
had
an
attack
of
second
sight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
Graham
,
of
whom
does
that
young
lady
remind
you
?
"
<EOS>
pointing
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
you
put
her
out
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
I
often
tell
you
abruptness
is
your
fault
;
remember
,
too
,
that
to
you
she
is
a
stranger
,
and
does
not
know
your
ways
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
when
she
looks
down
;
now
,
when
she
turns
sideways
,
who
is
she
like
,
Graham
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
mamma
,
since
you
propound
the
riddle
,
I
think
you
ought
to
solve
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
known
her
some
time
,
you
say
 
ever
since
you
first
began
to
attend
the
school
in
the
Rue
Fossette
:
 
<EOS>
yet
you
never
mentioned
to
me
that
singular
resemblance
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
mention
a
thing
of
which
I
never
thought
,
and
which
I
do
not
now
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
What
_
<EOS>
can
_
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stupid
boy
!
<EOS>
look
at
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Graham
did
look
:
but
this
was
not
to
be
endured
;
I
saw
how
it
must
end
,
so
I
thought
it
best
to
anticipate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dr.
John
,
"
I
said
,
"
has
had
so
much
to
do
and
think
of
,
since
he
and
I
shook
hands
at
our
last
parting
in
St.
Ann
's
Street
,
that
,
while
I
readily
found
out
Mr.
Graham
Bretton
,
some
months
ago
,
it
never
occurred
to
me
as
possible
that
he
should
recognise
Lucy
Snowe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
Snowe
!
<EOS>
I
thought
so
!
<EOS>
I
knew
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
And
she
at
once
stepped
across
the
hearth
and
kissed
me
.
<EOS>
Some
ladies
would
,
perhaps
,
have
made
a
great
bustle
upon
such
a
discovery
without
being
particularly
glad
of
it
;
but
it
was
not
my
godmother
's
habit
to
make
a
bustle
,
and
she
preferred
all
sentimental
demonstrations
in
bas
-
relief
.
<EOS>
So
she
and
I
got
over
the
surprise
with
few
words
and
a
single
salute
;
yet
I
daresay
she
was
pleased
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
I
was
.
<EOS>
While
we
renewed
old
acquaintance
,
Graham
,
sitting
opposite
,
silently
disposed
of
his
paroxysm
of
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
calls
me
a
stupid
boy
,
and
I
think
I
am
so
,
"
at
length
he
said
;
"
for
,
upon
my
honour
,
often
as
I
have
seen
you
,
I
never
once
suspected
this
fact
:
<EOS>
and
yet
I
perceive
it
all
now
.
<EOS>
Lucy
Snowe
!
<EOS>
To
be
sure
!
<EOS>
I
recollect
her
perfectly
,
and
there
she
sits
;
not
a
doubt
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
,
"
he
added
,
"
you
surely
have
not
known
me
as
an
old
acquaintance
all
this
time
,
and
never
mentioned
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
have
,
"
was
my
answer
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
John
commented
not
.
<EOS>
I
supposed
he
regarded
my
silence
as
eccentric
,
but
he
was
indulgent
in
refraining
from
censure
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
,
too
,
he
would
have
deemed
it
impertinent
to
have
interrogated
me
very
closely
,
to
have
asked
me
the
why
and
wherefore
of
my
reserve
;
and
,
though
he
might
feel
a
little
curious
,
the
importance
of
the
case
was
by
no
means
such
as
to
tempt
curiosity
to
infringe
on
discretion
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
just
ventured
to
inquire
whether
he
remembered
the
circumstance
of
my
once
looking
at
him
very
fixedly
;
for
the
slight
annoyance
he
had
betrayed
on
that
occasion
still
lingered
sore
on
my
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
:
"
<EOS>
I
think
I
was
even
cross
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
considered
me
a
little
bold
;
perhaps
?
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
.
<EOS>
Only
,
shy
and
retiring
as
your
general
manner
was
,
I
wondered
what
personal
or
facial
enormity
in
me
proved
so
magnetic
to
your
usually
averted
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
how
it
was
now
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Perfectly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
here
Mrs.
Bretton
broke
in
with
many
,
many
questions
about
past
times
;
and
for
her
satisfaction
I
had
to
recur
to
gone
-
by
troubles
,
to
explain
causes
of
seeming
estrangement
,
to
touch
on
single
-
handed
conflict
with
Life
,
with
Death
,
with
Grief
,
with
Fate
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
listened
,
saying
little
.
<EOS>
He
and
she
then
told
me
of
changes
they
had
known
:
even
with
them
all
had
not
gone
smoothly
,
and
fortune
had
retrenched
her
once
abundant
gifts
.
<EOS>
But
so
courageous
a
mother
,
with
such
a
champion
in
her
son
,
was
well
fitted
to
fight
a
good
fight
with
the
world
,
and
to
prevail
ultimately
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
himself
was
one
of
those
on
whose
birth
benign
planets
have
certainly
smiled
.
<EOS>
Adversity
might
set
against
him
her
most
sullen
front
:
he
was
the
man
to
beat
her
down
with
smiles
.
<EOS>
Strong
and
cheerful
,
and
firm
and
courteous
;
not
rash
,
yet
valiant
;
he
was
the
aspirant
to
woo
Destiny
herself
,
and
to
win
from
her
stone
eyeballs
a
beam
almost
loving
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
profession
he
had
adopted
,
his
success
was
now
quite
decided
.
<EOS>
Within
the
last
three
months
he
had
taken
this
house
(
a
small
château
,
they
told
me
,
about
half
a
league
without
the
Porte
de
Crécy
)
;
this
country
site
being
chosen
for
the
sake
of
his
mother
's
health
,
with
which
town
air
did
not
now
agree
.
<EOS>
Hither
he
had
invited
Mrs.
Bretton
,
and
she
,
on
leaving
England
,
had
brought
with
her
such
residue
furniture
of
the
former
St.
Ann
's
Street
mansion
as
she
had
thought
fit
to
keep
unsold
.
<EOS>
Hence
my
bewilderment
at
the
phantoms
of
chairs
,
and
the
wraiths
of
looking
-
glasses
,
tea
-
urns
,
and
teacups
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
clock
struck
eleven
,
Dr.
John
stopped
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Snowe
must
retire
now
,
"
he
said
;
"
she
is
beginning
to
look
very
pale
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
I
will
venture
to
put
some
questions
respecting
the
cause
of
her
loss
of
health
.
<EOS>
She
is
much
changed
,
indeed
,
since
last
July
,
when
I
saw
her
enact
with
no
little
spirit
the
part
of
a
very
killing
fine
gentleman
.
<EOS>
As
to
last
night
's
catastrophe
,
I
am
sure
thereby
hangs
a
tale
,
but
we
will
inquire
no
further
this
evening
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
Miss
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
he
kindly
led
me
to
the
door
,
and
holding
a
wax
-
candle
,
lighted
me
up
the
one
flight
of
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
had
said
my
prayers
,
and
when
I
was
undressed
and
laid
down
,
I
felt
that
I
still
had
friends
.
<EOS>
Friends
,
not
professing
vehement
attachment
,
not
offering
the
tender
solace
of
well
-
matched
and
congenial
relationship
;
on
whom
,
therefore
,
but
moderate
demand
of
affection
was
to
be
made
,
of
whom
but
moderate
expectation
formed
;
but
towards
whom
my
heart
softened
instinctively
,
and
yearned
with
an
importunate
gratitude
,
which
I
entreated
Reason
betimes
to
check
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
let
me
think
of
them
too
often
,
too
much
,
too
fondly
,
"
I
implored
:
"
let
me
be
content
with
a
temperate
draught
of
this
living
stream
:
<EOS>
let
me
not
run
athirst
,
and
apply
passionately
to
its
welcome
waters
:
let
me
not
imagine
in
them
a
sweeter
taste
than
<EOS>
earth
's
fountains
know
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
would
to
God
I
may
be
enabled
to
feel
enough
sustained
by
an
occasional
,
amicable
intercourse
,
rare
,
brief
,
unengrossing
and
tranquil
:
quite
tranquil
!
"
  
<EOS>
Still
repeating
this
word
,
I
turned
to
my
pillow
;
and
_
<EOS>
still
_
repeating
it
,
I
steeped
that
pillow
with
tears
.
    
<EOS>
LA
TERRASSE
.
  
<EOS>
These
struggles
with
the
natural
character
,
the
strong
native
bent
of
the
heart
,
may
seem
futile
and
fruitless
,
but
in
the
end
they
do
good
.
<EOS>
They
tend
,
however
slightly
,
to
give
the
actions
,
the
conduct
,
that
turn
which
Reason
approves
,
and
<EOS>
which
Feeling
,
perhaps
,
too
often
opposes
:
they
certainly
make
a
difference
in
the
general
tenour
of
a
life
,
and
enable
it
to
be
better
regulated
,
more
equable
,
quieter
on
the
surface
;
and
it
is
on
the
surface
only
the
common
gaze
will
fall
.
<EOS>
As
to
what
lies
below
,
leave
that
with
God
.
<EOS>
Man
,
your
equal
,
weak
as
you
,
and
not
fit
to
be
your
judge
,
may
be
shut
out
thence
:
take
it
to
your
Maker
 
<EOS>
show
Him
the
secrets
of
the
spirit
He
gave
 
ask
Him
how
you
are
to
bear
the
pains
He
has
appointed
 
kneel
in
His
presence
,
and
pray
with
faith
for
light
in
darkness
,
for
strength
in
piteous
weakness
,
for
patience
in
extreme
need
.
<EOS>
Certainly
,
at
some
hour
,
though
perhaps
not
_
your
_
hour
,
the
waiting
waters
will
stir
;
<EOS>
in
_
some
_
shape
,
though
perhaps
not
the
shape
you
dreamed
,
which
your
heart
loved
,
and
for
which
it
bled
,
the
healing
herald
will
descend
,
the
cripple
and
the
blind
,
and
the
dumb
,
and
the
possessed
will
be
led
to
bathe
.
<EOS>
Herald
,
come
quickly
!
<EOS>
Thousands
lie
round
the
pool
,
weeping
and
despairing
,
to
see
it
,
through
slow
years
,
stagnant
.
<EOS>
Long
are
the
"
times
"
of
Heaven
:
the
orbits
of
angel
messengers
seem
wide
to
mortal
vision
;
they
may
enring
ages
:
the
cycle
of
one
departure
and
return
may
clasp
unnumbered
generations
;
and
dust
,
kindling
to
brief
suffering
life
,
and
through
pain
,
passing
back
to
dust
,
may
meanwhile
perish
out
of
memory
again
,
and
yet
again
.
<EOS>
To
how
many
maimed
and
mourning
millions
is
the
first
and
sole
angel
visitant
,
him
easterns
call
Azrael
!
  
<EOS>
I
tried
to
get
up
next
morning
,
but
while
I
was
dressing
,
and
at
intervals
drinking
cold
water
from
the
_
carafe
_
on
my
washstand
,
with
design
to
brace
up
that
trembling
weakness
which
made
dressing
so
difficult
,
in
came
Mrs.
Bretton
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
is
an
absurdity
!
"
was
her
morning
accost
.
"
<EOS>
Not
so
,
"
she
added
,
and
dealing
with
me
at
once
in
her
own
brusque
,
energetic
fashion
 
<EOS>
that
fashion
which
I
used
formerly
to
enjoy
seeing
applied
to
her
son
,
and
by
him
vigorously
resisted
 
in
two
minutes
<EOS>
she
consigned
me
captive
to
the
French
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
you
lie
till
afternoon
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
boy
left
orders
before
he
went
out
that
such
should
be
the
case
,
and
I
can
assure
you
my
son
is
master
and
must
be
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Presently
you
shall
have
breakfast
.
"
  
<EOS>
Presently
she
brought
that
meal
 
<EOS>
brought
it
with
her
own
active
hands
 
not
leaving
me
to
servants
.
<EOS>
She
seated
herself
on
the
bed
while
I
ate
.
<EOS>
Now
it
is
not
everybody
,
even
amongst
our
respected
friends
and
esteemed
acquaintance
,
whom
we
like
to
have
near
us
,
whom
we
like
to
watch
us
,
to
wait
on
us
,
to
approach
us
with
the
proximity
of
a
nurse
to
a
patient
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
every
friend
whose
eye
is
a
light
in
a
sick
room
,
whose
presence
is
there
a
solace
:
but
all
this
was
Mrs.
Bretton
to
me
;
all
this
she
had
ever
been
.
<EOS>
Food
or
drink
never
pleased
me
so
well
as
when
it
came
through
her
hands
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
the
occasion
when
her
entrance
into
a
room
had
not
made
that
room
cheerier
.
<EOS>
Our
natures
own
predilections
and
antipathies
alike
strange
.
<EOS>
There
are
people
from
whom
we
secretly
shrink
,
whom
we
would
personally
avoid
,
though
reason
confesses
that
they
are
good
people
:
there
are
others
with
faults
of
temper
,
&
c.
,
evident
enough
,
beside
whom
we
live
content
,
as
if
the
air
about
them
did
us
good
.
<EOS>
My
godmother
's
lively
black
eye
and
clear
brunette
cheek
,
her
warm
,
prompt
hand
,
her
self
-
reliant
mood
,
her
decided
bearing
,
were
all
beneficial
to
me
as
the
atmosphere
of
some
salubrious
climate
.
<EOS>
Her
son
used
to
call
her
"
the
old
lady
;
"
it
filled
me
with
pleasant
wonder
to
note
how
the
alacrity
and
power
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
still
breathed
from
her
and
around
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
bring
my
work
here
,
"
she
said
,
as
she
took
from
me
the
emptied
teacup
,
"
and
sit
with
you
the
whole
day
,
if
that
overbearing
John
Graham
had
not
put
his
veto
upon
such
a
proceeding
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
mamma
,
"
he
said
,
when
he
went
out
,
"
take
notice
,
you
are
not
to
knock
up
your
god
-
daughter
with
gossip
,
"
and
he
particularly
desired
me
to
keep
close
to
my
own
quarters
,
and
spare
you
my
fine
company
.
<EOS>
He
says
,
Lucy
,
he
thinks
you
have
had
a
nervous
fever
,
judging
from
your
look
,
 
is
that
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
replied
that
I
did
not
quite
know
what
my
ailment
had
been
,
but
that
I
had
certainly
suffered
a
good
deal
especially
in
mind
.
<EOS>
Further
,
on
this
subject
,
I
did
not
consider
it
advisable
to
dwell
,
for
the
details
of
what
I
had
undergone
belonged
to
a
portion
of
my
existence
in
which
I
never
expected
my
godmother
to
take
a
share
.
<EOS>
Into
what
a
new
region
would
such
a
confidence
have
led
that
hale
,
serene
nature
!
<EOS>
The
difference
between
her
and
me
might
be
figured
by
that
between
the
stately
ship
cruising
safe
on
smooth
seas
,
with
its
full
complement
of
crew
,
a
captain
gay
and
brave
,
and
venturous
and
provident
;
and
the
life
-
boat
,
which
most
days
of
the
year
lies
dry
and
solitary
in
an
old
,
dark
boat
-
house
,
only
putting
to
sea
when
the
billows
run
high
in
rough
weather
,
when
cloud
encounters
water
,
when
danger
and
death
divide
between
them
the
rule
of
the
great
deep
.
<EOS>
No
,
the
"
Louisa
Bretton
"
never
was
out
of
harbour
on
such
a
night
,
and
in
such
a
scene
:
her
crew
could
not
conceive
it
;
so
the
half
-
drowned
life
-
boat
man
keeps
his
own
counsel
,
and
spins
no
yarns
.
  
<EOS>
She
left
me
,
and
I
lay
in
bed
content
:
it
was
good
of
Graham
to
remember
me
before
he
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
My
day
was
lonely
,
but
the
prospect
of
coming
evening
abridged
and
cheered
it
.
<EOS>
Then
,
too
,
I
felt
weak
,
and
rest
seemed
welcome
;
and
after
the
morning
hours
were
gone
by
,
 
those
hours
which
always
bring
,
even
to
the
necessarily
unoccupied
,
a
sense
of
business
to
be
done
,
of
tasks
waiting
fulfilment
,
a
vague
impression
of
obligation
to
be
employed
 
when
this
stirring
time
was
past
,
and
the
silent
descent
of
afternoon
hushed
housemaid
steps
on
the
stairs
and
in
the
chambers
,
I
then
passed
into
a
dreamy
mood
,
not
unpleasant
.
  
<EOS>
My
calm
little
room
seemed
somehow
like
a
cave
in
the
sea
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
colour
about
it
,
except
that
white
and
pale
green
,
suggestive
of
foam
and
deep
water
;
the
blanched
cornice
was
adorned
with
shell
-
shaped
ornaments
,
and
there
were
white
mouldings
like
dolphins
in
the
ceiling
-
angles
.
<EOS>
Even
that
one
touch
of
colour
visible
in
the
red
satin
pincushion
bore
affinity
to
coral
;
even
that
dark
,
shining
glass
might
have
mirrored
a
mermaid
.
<EOS>
When
I
closed
my
eyes
,
I
heard
a
gale
,
subsiding
at
last
,
bearing
upon
the
house
-
front
like
a
settling
swell
upon
a
rock
-
base
.
<EOS>
I
heard
it
drawn
and
withdrawn
far
,
far
off
,
like
a
tide
retiring
from
a
shore
of
the
upper
world
 
a
world
so
high
above
that
the
rush
of
its
largest
waves
,
the
dash
of
its
fiercest
breakers
,
could
sound
down
in
this
submarine
home
,
only
like
murmurs
and
a
lullaby
.
  
<EOS>
Amidst
these
dreams
came
evening
,
and
then
Martha
brought
a
light
;
with
her
aid
I
was
quickly
dressed
,
and
stronger
now
than
in
the
morning
,
I
made
my
way
down
to
the
blue
saloon
unassisted
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
John
,
it
appears
,
had
concluded
his
round
of
professional
calls
earlier
than
usual
;
his
form
was
the
first
object
that
met
my
eyes
as
I
entered
the
parlour
;
he
stood
in
that
window
-
recess
opposite
the
door
,
reading
the
close
type
of
a
newspaper
by
such
dull
light
as
closing
day
yet
gave
.
<EOS>
The
fire
shone
clear
,
but
the
lamp
stood
on
the
table
unlit
,
and
tea
was
not
yet
brought
up
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
Mrs.
Bretton
,
my
active
godmother
 
<EOS>
who
,
I
afterwards
found
,
had
been
out
in
the
open
air
all
day
 
lay
half
-
reclined
in
her
deep
-
cushioned
chair
,
actually
lost
in
a
nap
.
<EOS>
Her
son
seeing
me
,
came
forward
.
<EOS>
I
noticed
that
he
trod
carefully
,
not
to
wake
the
sleeper
;
he
also
spoke
low
:
his
mellow
voice
never
had
any
sharpness
in
it
;
modulated
as
at
present
,
it
was
calculated
rather
to
soothe
than
startle
slumber
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
quiet
little
château
,
"
he
observed
,
after
inviting
me
to
sit
near
the
casement
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
may
have
noticed
it
in
your
walks
:
though
,
indeed
,
from
the
chaussée
it
is
not
visible
;
just
a
mile
beyond
the
Porte
de
Crécy
,
you
turn
down
a
lane
which
soon
becomes
an
avenue
,
and
that
leads
you
on
,
through
meadow
and
shade
,
to
the
very
door
of
this
house
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
a
modern
place
,
but
built
somewhat
in
the
old
style
of
the
Basse
-
Ville
.
<EOS>
It
is
rather
a
manoir
than
a
château
;
they
call
it
"
La
Terrasse
,
"
because
its
front
rises
from
a
broad
turfed
walk
,
whence
steps
lead
down
a
grassy
slope
to
the
avenue
.
<EOS>
See
yonder
!
<EOS>
The
moon
rises
:
she
looks
well
through
the
tree
-
boles
.
"
  
<EOS>
Where
,
indeed
,
does
the
moon
not
look
well
?
<EOS>
What
is
the
scene
,
confined
or
expansive
,
which
her
orb
does
not
hallow
?
<EOS>
Rosy
or
fiery
<EOS>
,
she
mounted
now
above
a
not
distant
bank
;
even
while
we
watched
her
flushed
ascent
,
she
cleared
to
gold
,
and
in
very
brief
space
,
floated
up
stainless
into
a
now
calm
sky
.
<EOS>
Did
moonlight
soften
or
sadden
Dr.
Bretton
?
<EOS>
Did
it
touch
him
with
romance
?
<EOS>
I
think
it
did
.
<EOS>
Albeit
of
no
sighing
mood
,
he
sighed
in
watching
it
:
sighed
to
himself
quietly
.
<EOS>
No
need
to
ponder
the
cause
or
the
course
of
that
sigh
<EOS>
;
I
knew
it
was
wakened
by
beauty
;
I
knew
it
pursued
Ginevra
.
<EOS>
Knowing
this
,
the
idea
pressed
upon
me
that
it
was
in
some
sort
my
duty
to
speak
the
name
he
meditated
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
was
ready
for
the
subject
:
I
saw
in
his
countenance
a
teeming
plenitude
of
comment
,
question
and
interest
;
a
pressure
of
language
and
sentiment
,
only
checked
,
I
thought
,
by
sense
of
embarrassment
how
to
begin
.
<EOS>
To
spare
him
this
embarrassment
was
my
best
,
indeed
my
sole
use
.
<EOS>
I
had
but
to
utter
the
idol
's
name
,
and
love
's
tender
litany
would
flow
out
.
<EOS>
I
had
just
found
a
fitting
phrase
,
"
You
know
that
Miss
Fanshawe
is
gone
on
a
tour
with
the
Cholmondeleys
,
"
and
was
opening
my
lips
to
speak
to
it
,
when
he
scattered
my
plans
by
introducing
another
theme
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
first
thing
this
morning
,
"
said
he
,
putting
his
sentiment
in
his
pocket
,
turning
from
the
moon
,
and
sitting
down
,
"
<EOS>
I
went
to
the
Rue
Fossette
,
and
told
the
cuisinière
that
you
were
safe
and
in
good
hands
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
that
I
actually
found
that
she
had
not
yet
discovered
your
absence
from
the
house
:
she
thought
you
safe
in
the
great
dormitory
.
<EOS>
With
what
care
you
must
have
been
waited
on
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
all
that
is
very
conceivable
,
"
said
I.
"
Goton
could
do
nothing
for
me

bring
me
a
little
tisane
and
a
crust
of
bread

and
I
had
rejected
both
so
often
during
the
past
week
,
that
the
good
woman
got
tired
of
useless
journeys
from
the
dwelling
-
house
kitchen
to
the
school
-
dormitory
,
and
only
came
once
a
day
at
noon
to
make
my
bed
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
however
,
that
she
is
a
good
-
natured
creature
,
and
would
have
been
delighted
to
cook
me
côtelettes
de
mouton
,
if
I
could
have
eaten
them

What
did
Madame
Beck
mean
by
leaving
you
alone
?

<EOS>

Madame
Beck
could
not
foresee
that
I
should
fall
ill
.
<EOS>

<EOS>

Your
nervous
system
bore
a
good
share
of
the
suffering

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

I
am
not
quite
sure
what
my
nervous
system
is
,
but
I
was
dreadfully
low
-
spirited
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Which
disables
me
from
helping
you
by
pill
or
potion

<EOS>
Medicine
can
give
nobody
good
spirits

<EOS>
My
art
halts
at
the
threshold
of
Hypochondria
<EOS>
:
she
just
looks
in
and
sees
a
chamber
of
torture
,
but
can
neither
say
nor
do
much
.
<EOS>
Cheerful
society
would
be
of
use
;
you
should
be
as
little
alone
as
possible
;
you
should
take
plenty
of
exercise
.
"
  
<EOS>
Acquiescence
and
a
pause
followed
these
remarks
.
<EOS>
They
sounded
all
right
,
I
thought
,
and
bore
the
safe
sanction
of
custom
,
and
the
well
-
worn
stamp
of
use

<EOS>
"
Miss
Snowe
,
"
recommenced
Dr.
John
 
<EOS>
my
health
,
nervous
system
included
,
being
now
,
somewhat
to
my
relief
,
discussed
and
done
with
 
"
is
it
permitted
me
to
ask
what
your
religion
is
?
<EOS>
Are
you
a
Catholic
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
looked
up
in
some
surprise
 
<EOS>
"
A
Catholic
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
Why
suggest
such
an
idea
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
manner
in
which
you
were
consigned
to
me
last
night
made
me
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
consigned
to
you
?
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
I
forget
.
<EOS>
It
yet
remains
for
me
to
learn
how
I
fell
into
your
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
under
circumstances
that
puzzled
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
in
attendance
all
day
yesterday
on
a
case
of
singularly
interesting
and
critical
character
;
the
disease
being
rare
,
and
its
treatment
doubtful
<EOS>
:
I
saw
a
similar
and
still
finer
case
in
a
hospital
in
Paris
;
but
that
will
not
interest
you
.
<EOS>
At
last
a
mitigation
of
the
patient
's
most
urgent
symptoms
<EOS>
(
acute
pain
is
one
of
its
accompaniments
)
liberated
me
,
and
I
set
out
homeward
.
<EOS>
My
shortest
way
lay
through
the
Basse
-
Ville
,
and
as
the
night
was
excessively
dark
,
wild
,
and
wet
<EOS>
,
I
took
it
.
<EOS>
In
riding
past
an
old
church
belonging
to
a
community
of
Béguines
,
I
saw
by
a
lamp
burning
over
the
porch
or
deep
arch
of
the
entrance
,
a
priest
lifting
some
object
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
The
lamp
was
bright
enough
to
reveal
the
priest
's
features
clearly
,
and
I
recognised
him
;
he
was
a
man
I
have
often
met
by
the
sick
beds
of
both
rich
and
poor
:
and
chiefly
the
latter
.
<EOS>
He
is
,
I
think
,
a
good
old
man
,
far
better
than
most
of
his
class
in
this
country
;
superior
,
indeed
,
in
every
way
,
better
informed
,
as
well
as
more
devoted
to
duty
.
<EOS>
Our
eyes
met
;
he
called
on
me
to
stop
:
<EOS>
what
he
supported
was
a
woman
,
fainting
or
dying
.
<EOS>
I
alighted
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
This
person
is
one
of
your
countrywomen
,
"
he
said
:
"
save
her
,
if
she
is
not
dead
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
countrywoman
,
on
examination
,
turned
out
to
be
the
English
teacher
at
Madame
Beck
's
pensionnat
.
<EOS>
She
was
perfectly
unconscious
,
perfectly
bloodless
,
and
nearly
cold
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
What
does
it
all
mean
?
<EOS>
"
was
my
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
communicated
a
curious
account
;
that
you
had
been
to
him
that
evening
at
confessional
;
that
your
exhausted
and
suffering
appearance
,
coupled
with
some
things
you
had
said
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Things
I
had
said
?
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
things
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Awful
crimes
,
no
doubt
;
but
he
did
not
tell
me
what
:
there
,
you
know
,
the
seal
of
the
confessional
checked
his
garrulity
,
and
my
curiosity
.
<EOS>
Your
confidences
,
however
,
had
not
made
an
enemy
of
the
good
father
;
it
seems
he
was
so
struck
,
and
felt
so
sorry
that
you
should
be
out
on
such
a
night
alone
,
that
he
had
esteemed
it
a
Christian
duty
to
watch
you
when
you
quitted
the
church
,
and
so
to
manage
as
not
to
lose
sight
of
you
,
till
you
should
have
reached
home
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
worthy
man
might
,
half
unconsciously
,
have
blent
in
this
proceeding
some
little
of
the
subtlety
of
his
class
:
it
might
have
been
his
resolve
to
learn
the
locality
of
your
home
 
<EOS>
did
you
impart
that
in
your
confession
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
:
on
the
contrary
,
I
carefully
avoided
the
shadow
of
any
indication
:
and
as
to
my
confession
,
Dr.
John
,
I
suppose
you
will
think
me
mad
for
taking
such
a
step
,
but
I
could
not
help
it
:
I
suppose
it
was
all
the
fault
of
what
you
call
my
"
nervous
system
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
put
the
case
into
words
,
but
my
days
and
nights
were
grown
intolerable
:
a
cruel
sense
of
desolation
pained
my
mind
:
a
feeling
that
would
make
its
way
,
rush
out
,
or
kill
me
 
like
(
and
this
you
will
understand
,
Dr.
John
)
<EOS>
the
current
which
passes
through
the
heart
,
and
which
,
if
aneurism
or
any
other
morbid
cause
obstructs
its
natural
channels
,
seeks
abnormal
outlet
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
companionship
,
I
wanted
friendship
,
I
wanted
counsel
.
<EOS>
I
could
find
none
of
these
in
closet
or
chamber
,
so
I
went
and
sought
them
in
church
and
confessional
.
<EOS>
As
to
what
I
said
,
it
was
no
confidence
,
no
narrative
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
nothing
wrong
:
my
life
has
not
been
active
enough
for
any
dark
deed
,
either
of
romance
or
reality
:
all
I
poured
out
was
a
dreary
,
desperate
complaint
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
you
ought
to
travel
for
about
six
months

why
,
your
calm
nature
is
growing
quite
excitable

Confound
Madame
Beck
!
<EOS>
Has
the
little
buxom
widow
no
bowels
,
to
condemn
her
best
teacher
to
solitary
confinement
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
Madame
Beck
's
fault
,
"
said
I
;
"
it
is
no
living
being
's
fault
,
and
I
wo
n't
hear
any
one
blamed

Who
is
in
the
wrong
,
then
,
Lucy
?
<EOS>

Me
 
Dr.
John
 
me
;
and
a
great
abstraction
on
whose
wide
shoulders
I
like
to
lay
the
mountains
of
blame
they
were
sculptured
to
bear
:
me
and
Fate
.
"
  
"
"
Me
"
must
take
better
care
in
future
,
"
said
Dr.
John
 
smiling
,
I
suppose
,
at
my
bad
grammar
.
  
<EOS>
"
Change
of
air
 
change
of
scene
;
those
are
my
prescriptions
,
"
pursued
the
practical
young
doctor
.

<EOS>
But
to
return
to
our
muttons
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
As
yet
,
Père
Silas
,
with
all
his
tact
(
they
say
he
is
a
Jesuit
)
,
is
no
wiser
than
you
choose
him
to
be
;
for
,
instead
of
returning
to
the
Rue
Fossette
,
your
fevered
wanderings
 
there
must
have
been
high
fever
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
Dr.
John
:
the
fever
took
its
turn
that
night
 
now
,
do
n't
make
out
that
I
was
delirious
,
for
I
know
differently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
!
<EOS>
you
were
as
collected
as
myself
at
this
moment
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
Your
wanderings
had
taken
an
opposite
direction
to
the
pensionnat
.
<EOS>
Near
the
Béguinage
,
amidst
the
stress
of
flood
and
gust
,
and
in
the
perplexity
of
darkness
,
you
had
swooned
and
fallen
.
<EOS>
The
priest
came
to
your
succour
,
and
the
physician
,
as
we
have
seen
,
supervened
.
<EOS>
Between
us
we
procured
a
fiacre
and
brought
you
here
.
<EOS>
Père
Silas
,
old
as
he
is
,
would
carry
you
up
-
stairs
,
and
lay
you
on
that
couch
himself
.
<EOS>
He
would
certainly
have
remained
with
you
till
suspended
animation
had
been
restored
:
and
so
should
I
,
but
,
at
that
juncture
,
a
hurried
messenger
arrived
from
the
dying
patient
<EOS>
I
had
scarcely
left
 
<EOS>
the
last
duties
were
called
for
 
the
physician
's
last
visit
and
the
priest
's
last
rite
;
extreme
unction
could
not
be
deferred
.
<EOS>
Père
Silas
and
myself
departed
together
,
my
mother
was
spending
the
evening
abroad
;
we
gave
you
in
charge
to
Martha
,
leaving
directions
,
which
it
seems
she
followed
successfully

Now
,
are
you
a
Catholic
?

<EOS>
Not
yet

said
I
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
And
never
let
Père
Silas
know
where
I
live
,
or
he
will
try
to
convert
me
;
but
give
him
my
best
and
truest
thanks
when
you
see
him
,
and
if
ever
I
get
rich
I
will
send
him
money
for
his
charities

<EOS>
See
,
Dr.
John
,
your
mother
wakes

you
ought
to
ring
for
tea

<EOS>
Which
he
did
;
and
,
as
Mrs.
Bretton
sat
up
 
astonished
and
indignant
at
herself
for
the
indulgence
to
which
she
had
succumbed
,
and
fully
prepared
to
deny
that
she
had
slept
at
all
 
her
son
came
gaily
to
the
attack

never

the
slightest
doze
possible

"
<EOS>
Exactly
!
<EOS>
a
seraph
's
gentle
lapse
 
<EOS>
a

<EOS>
Mamma
,
under
such
circumstances
,
you
always
remind
me
of
Titania

are
so

you
ever
hear
anything

Keep
your
compliments

yourself
,

do
not
neglect
your

seems
to
me
a
good
deal
on
the
increase

<EOS>
Lucy
,
has
he
not
rather
the
air
of
an
incipient
John
Bull
?
<EOS>
He
used
to
be
slender
as
an
eel

now
I
fancy
in
him
a
sort
of
heavy
dragoon
bent

notice

fat

disown
you

As

sooner
disown

happiness

would
pine
away
in
green
and
yellow
melancholy
if
she
had
not
my
six
feet
of
iniquity
to
scold
.
<EOS>
It
keeps
her
lively
 
<EOS>
it
maintains
the
wholesome
ferment
of
her
spirits
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
two
were
now
standing
opposite
to
each
other
,
one
on
each
side
<EOS>
the
fire
-
place
;
their
words
were
not
very
fond
,
but
their
mutual
looks
atoned
for
verbal
deficiencies
.
<EOS>
At
least
,
the
best
treasure
of
Mrs.
Bretton
's
life
was
certainly
casketed
in
her
son
's
bosom
;
her
dearest
pulse
throbbed
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
As
to
him
,
of
course
another
love
shared
his
feelings
with
filial
love
,
and
,
no
doubt
,
as
the
new
passion
was
the
latest
born
,
so
he
assigned
it
in
his
emotions
Benjamin
's
portion
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
!
<EOS>
Ginevra
!
<EOS>
Did
Mrs.
Bretton
yet
know
at
whose
feet
her
own
young
idol
had
laid
his
homage
?
<EOS>
Would
she
approve
that
choice
?
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
;
but
I
could
well
guess
that
if
she
knew
Miss
Fanshawe
's
conduct
towards
Graham
:
her
alternations
between
coldness
and
coaxing
,
and
repulse
and
allurement
;
if
she
could
at
all
suspect
the
pain
with
which
she
had
tried
him
;
if
she
could
have
seen
,
as
I
had
seen
,
his
fine
spirits
subdued
and
harassed
,
his
inferior
preferred
before
him
,
his
subordinate
made
the
instrument
of
his
humiliation
 
_
<EOS>
then
_
Mrs.
Bretton
would
have
pronounced
Ginevra
imbecile
,
or
perverted
,
or
both
.
<EOS>
Well
 
I
thought
so
too
.
  
<EOS>
That
second
evening
passed
as
sweetly
as
the
first
 
_
more
_
sweetly
indeed
:
we
enjoyed
a
smoother
interchange
of
thought
;
old
troubles
were
not
reverted
to
,
acquaintance
was
better
cemented
;
I
felt
happier
,
easier
,
more
at
home
.
<EOS>
That
night
 
instead
of
crying
myself
asleep
 
<EOS>
I
went
down
to
dreamland
by
a
pathway
bordered
with
pleasant
thoughts
.
    
<EOS>
WE
QUARREL
.
  
<EOS>
During
the
first
days
of
my
stay
at
the
Terrace
,
Graham
never
took
a
seat
near
me
,
or
in
his
frequent
pacing
of
the
room
approached
the
quarter
where
I
sat
,
or
looked
pre
-
occupied
,
or
more
grave
than
usual
,
but
I
thought
of
Miss
Fanshawe
and
expected
her
name
to
leap
from
his
lips
.
<EOS>
I
kept
my
ear
and
mind
in
perpetual
readiness
for
the
tender
theme
;
my
patience
was
ordered
to
be
permanently
under
arms
,
and
my
sympathy
desired
to
keep
its
cornucopia
replenished
and
ready
for
outpouring
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
and
after
a
little
inward
struggle
,
which
I
saw
and
respected
,
he
one
day
launched
into
the
topic
.
<EOS>
It
was
introduced
delicately
;
anonymously
as
it

Your

spending
her
vacation
in
travelling

I
hear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Friend
,
forsooth
!
"
thought
I
to
myself
:
but
it
would
not
do
to
contradict
;
he
must
have
his
own
way
;
I
must
own
the
soft
impeachment
<EOS>
:
friend
let
it
be
.
<EOS>
Still
,
by
way
of
experiment
,
I
could
not
help
asking
whom
he
meant
?
  
<EOS>
He
had
taken
a
seat
at
my
work
-
table
;
he
now
laid
hands
on
a
reel
of
thread
which
he
proceeded
recklessly
to
unwind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ginevra
 
Miss
Fanshawe
,
has
accompanied
the
Cholmondeleys
on
a
tour
through
the
south
of
France
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
and
she
correspond
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
astonish
you
to
hear
that
I
never
once
thought
of
making
application
for
that
privilege
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
letters
of
her
writing
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
several
to
her
uncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
They
will
not
be
deficient
in
wit
and
_
naïveté
_
;
there
is
so
much
sparkle
,
and
so
little
art
in
her
soul
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
writes
comprehensively
enough
when
she
writes
to
M.
de
Bassompierre
:
he
who
runs
may
read
.
"
<EOS>
(
In
fact
,
Ginevra
's
epistles
to
her
wealthy
kinsman
were
commonly
business
documents
,
unequivocal
applications
for
cash
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
her
handwriting
?
<EOS>
It
must
be
pretty
,
light
,
ladylike
,
I
should
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
,
and
<EOS>
I
said
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
verily
believe
that
all
she
does
is
well
done
,
"
said
Dr.
John
;
and
as
I
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
chime
in
with
this
remark
,
he
added
"
You
,
who
know
her
,
could
you
name
a
point
in
which
she
is
deficient
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
does
several
things
very
well
.
"
<EOS>
(
"
Flirtation
amongst
the
rest

"
subjoined
I
,
in
thought
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
When
do
you
suppose
she
will
return
to
town
?
"
he
soon
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
Dr.
John
,
I
must
explain
.
<EOS>
You
honour
me
too
much
in
ascribing
to
me
a
degree
of
intimacy
with
Miss
Fanshawe
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
felicity
to
enjoy
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
been
the
depositary
of
her
plans
and
secrets
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
her
particular
friends
in
another
sphere
than
mine
:
amongst
the
Cholmondeleys
,
for
instance
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
actually
thought
I
was
stung
with
a
kind
of
jealous
pain
similar
to
his
own
!
  
<EOS>
"
Excuse
her
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
;
"
judge
her
indulgently
;
the
glitter
of
fashion
misleads
her
,
but
she
will
soon
find
out
that
these
people
are
hollow
,
and
will
return
to
you
with
augmented
attachment
and
confirmed
trust
.
<EOS>
I
know
something
of
the
Cholmondeleys
:
superficial
,
showy
,
selfish
people
;
depend
on
it
,
at
heart
Ginevra
values
you
beyond
a
score
of
such
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
,
"
I
said
briefly
.
  
<EOS>
A
disclaimer
of
the
sentiments
attributed
to
me
burned
on
my
lips
,
but
I
extinguished
the
flame
.
<EOS>
I
submitted
to
be
looked
upon
as
the
humiliated
,
cast
-
off
,
and
now
pining
confidante
of
the
distinguished
Miss
Fanshawe
:
but
,
reader
,
it
was
a
hard
submission
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
,
you
see
,
"
continued
Graham
,
"
while
I
comfort
_
you
_
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
take
the
same
consolation
to
myself
;
I
can
not
hope
she
will
do
me
justice
.
<EOS>
De
Hamal
is
most
worthless
,
yet
I
fear
he
pleases
her
:
wretched
delusion
!
"
  
<EOS>
My
patience
really
gave
way
,
and
without
notice
:
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
illness
and
weakness
had
worn
it
and
made
it
brittle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dr.
Bretton
,
"
I
broke
out
,
"
there
is
no
delusion
like
your
own
.
<EOS>
On
all
points
but
one
you
are
a
man
,
frank
,
healthful
,
right
-
thinking
,
clear
-
sighted
:
on
this
exceptional
point
you
are
but
a
slave
.
<EOS>
I
declare
,
where
Miss
Fanshawe
is
concerned
,
you
merit
no
respect
;
nor
have
you
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
got
up
,
and
left
the
room
very
much
excited
.
  
<EOS>
This
little
scene
took
place
in
the
morning
;
I
had
to
meet
him
again
in
the
evening
,
and
then
I
saw
I
had
done
mischief
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
made
of
common
clay
,
not
put
together
out
of
vulgar
materials
;
while
the
outlines
of
his
nature
had
been
shaped
with
breadth
and
vigour
,
the
details
embraced
workmanship
of
almost
feminine
delicacy
:
finer
,
much
finer
,
than
you
could
be
prepared
to
meet
with
;
than
you
could
believe
inherent
in
him
,
even
after
years
of
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
till
some
over
-
sharp
contact
with
his
nerves
had
betrayed
,
by
its
effects
,
their
acute
sensibility
,
this
elaborate
construction
must
be
ignored
;
and
the
more
especially
because
the
sympathetic
faculty
was
not
prominent
in
him
:
to
feel
,
and
to
seize
quickly
another
's
feelings
,
are
separate
properties
;
a
few
constructions
possess
both
,
some
neither
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
had
the
one
in
exquisite
perfection
;
and
because
I
have
admitted
that
he
was
not
endowed
with
the
other
in
equal
degree
,
the
reader
will
considerately
refrain
from
passing
to
an
extreme
,
and
pronouncing
him
_
un_sympathizing
,
unfeeling
:
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
he
was
a
kind
,
generous
man
.
<EOS>
Make
your
need
known
,
his
hand
was
open
.
<EOS>
Put
your
grief
into
words
,
he
turned
no
deaf
ear
.
<EOS>
Expect
refinements
of
perception
,
miracles
of
intuition
,
and
realize
disappointment
.
<EOS>
This
night
,
when
Dr.
John
entered
the
room
,
and
met
the
evening
lamp
,
I
saw
well
and
at
one
glance
his
whole
mechanism
.
  
<EOS>
To
one
who
had
named
him
"
slave
,
"
and
,
on
any
point
,
banned
him
from
respect
,
he
must
now
have
peculiar
feelings
.
<EOS>
That
the
epithet
was
well
applied
,
and
the
ban
just
,
might
be
;
he
put
forth
no
denial
that
it
was
so
:
<EOS>
his
mind
even
candidly
revolved
that
unmanning
possibility
.
<EOS>
He
sought
in
this
accusation
the
cause
of
that
ill
-
success
which
had
got
<EOS>
so
galling
a
hold
on
his
mental
peace
<EOS>
:
Amid
the
worry
of
a
self
-
condemnatory
soliloquy
,
his
demeanour
seemed
grave
,
perhaps
cold
,
both
to
me
and
his
mother
.
<EOS>
And
yet
there
was
no
bad
feeling
,
no
malice
,
no
rancour
,
no
littleness
in
his
countenance
,
beautiful
with
a
man
's
best
beauty
,
even
in
its
depression
.
<EOS>
When
I
placed
his
chair
at
the
table
,
which
I
hastened
to
do
,
anticipating
the
servant
,
and
when
I
handed
him
his
tea
,
which
I
did
with
trembling
care
,
he
said
:
"
Thank
you
,
Lucy
,
"
in
as
kindly
a
tone
of
his
full
pleasant
voice
as
ever
my
ear
welcomed
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
there
was
only
one
plan
to
be
pursued
;
I
must
expiate
my
culpable
vehemence
,
or
I
must
not
sleep
that
night
.
<EOS>
This
would
not
do
at
all
;
I
could
not
stand
it
<EOS>
:
I
made
no
pretence
of
capacity
to
wage
war
on
this
footing
.
<EOS>
School
solitude
,
conventual
silence
and
stagnation
,
<EOS>
anything
seemed
preferable
to
living
embroiled
with
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
As
to
Ginevra
,
she
might
take
the
silver
wings
of
a
dove
,
or
any
other
fowl
that
flies
,
and
mount
straight
up
to
the
highest
place
,
among
the
highest
stars
,
where
her
lover
's
highest
flight
of
fancy
chose
to
fix
the
constellation
of
her
charms
:
never
more
be
it
mine
to
dispute
the
arrangement
.
<EOS>
Long
I
tried
to
catch
his
eye
.
<EOS>
Again
and
again
that
eye
just
met
mine
;
but
,
having
nothing
to
say
,
it
withdrew
,
and
I
was
baffled
.
<EOS>
After
tea
,
he
sat
,
sad
and
quiet
,
reading
a
book
.
<EOS>
I
wished
I
could
have
dared
to
go
and
sit
near
him
,
but
it
seemed
that
if
I
ventured
to
take
that
step
,
he
would
infallibly
evince
hostility
and
indignation
.
<EOS>
I
longed
to
speak
out
,
and
I
dared
not
whisper
.
<EOS>
His
mother
left
the
room
;
then
,
moved
by
insupportable
regret
,
I
just
murmured
the
words
"
Dr.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
up
from
his
book
;
his
eyes
were
not
cold
or
malevolent
,
his
mouth
was
not
cynical
;
he
was
ready
and
willing
to
hear
what
I
might
have
to
say
:
his
spirit
was
of
vintage
too
mellow
and
generous
to
sour
in
one
thunder
-
clap
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dr.
Bretton
,
forgive
my
hasty
words
:
<EOS>
_
do
,
do
_
forgive
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
smiled
that
moment
I
spoke
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
deserved
them
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
respect
me
,
I
am
sure
it
is
because
I
am
not
respectable
.
<EOS>
I
fear
,
I
am
an
awkward
fool
:
I
must
manage
badly
in
some
way
,
for
where
I
wish
to
please
,
it
seems
I
do
n't
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Of
that
you
can
not
be
sure
;
and
even
if
such
be
the
case
,
is
it
the
fault
of
your
character
,
or
of
another
's
perceptions
?
<EOS>
But
now
,
let
me
unsay
what
I
said
in
anger
.
<EOS>
In
one
thing
,
and
in
all
things
,
I
deeply
respect
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
think
scarcely
enough
of
yourself
,
and
too
much
of
others
,
what
is
that
but
an
excellence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
think
too
much
of
Ginevra
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
I
_
believe
you
may
;
_
you
_
believe
you
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
Let
us
agree
to
differ
.
<EOS>
Let
me
be
pardoned
;
that
is
what
I
ask
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
think
I
cherish
ill
-
will
for
one
warm
word
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
do
not
and
can
not
;
but
just
say
,
"
Lucy
,
I
forgive
you
!
"
<EOS>
Say
that
,
to
ease
me
of
the
heart
-
ache
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Put
away
your
heart
-
ache
,
as
I
will
put
away
mine
;
for
you
wounded
me
a
little
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Now
,
when
the
pain
is
gone
,
I
more
than
forgive
<EOS>
:
I
feel
grateful
,
as
to
a
sincere
well
-
wisher
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
am
_
<EOS>
your
sincere
well
-
wisher
:
you
are
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thus
our
quarrel
ended
.
  
<EOS>
Reader
,
if
in
the
course
of
this
work
,
you
find
that
my
opinion
of
Dr.
John
undergoes
modification
,
excuse
the
seeming
inconsistency
.
<EOS>
I
give
the
feeling
as
at
the
time
I
felt
it
;
I
describe
the
view
of
character
as
it
appeared
when
discovered
.
  
<EOS>
He
showed
the
fineness
of
his
nature
by
being
kinder
to
me
after
that
misunderstanding
than
before
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
very
incident
which
,
by
my
theory
,
must
in
some
degree
estrange
me
and
him
,
changed
,
indeed
,
somewhat
our
relations
;
but
not
in
the
sense
I
painfully
anticipated
.
<EOS>
An
invisible
,
but
a
cold
something
,
very
slight
,
very
transparent
,
but
very
chill
:
a
sort
of
screen
of
ice
had
hitherto
,
all
through
our
two
lives
,
glazed
the
medium
through
which
we
exchanged
intercourse
.
<EOS>
Those
few
warm
words
,
though
only
warm
with
anger
,
breathed
on
that
frail
frost
-
work
of
reserve
;
about
this
time
,
it
gave
note
of
dissolution
.
<EOS>
I
think
from
that
day
,
so
long
as
we
continued
friends
,
he
never
in
discourse
stood
on
topics
of
ceremony
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
know
that
if
he
would
but
talk
about
himself
,
and
about
that
in
which
he
was
most
interested
,
my
expectation
would
always
be
answered
,
my
wish
always
satisfied
.
<EOS>
It
follows
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
that
I
continued
to
hear
much
of
"
Ginevra
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ginevra
!
"
<EOS>
He
thought
her
so
fair
,
so
good
;
he
spoke
so
lovingly
of
her
charms
,
her
sweetness
,
her
innocence
,
that
,
in
spite
of
my
plain
prose
knowledge
of
the
reality
,
a
kind
of
reflected
glow
began
to
settle
on
her
idea
,
even
for
me
.
<EOS>
Still
,
reader
,
I
am
free
to
confess
,
that
he
often
talked
nonsense
;
but
I
strove
to
be
unfailingly
patient
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
had
had
my
lesson
:
I
had
learned
how
severe
for
me
was
the
pain
of
crossing
,
or
grieving
,
or
disappointing
him
.
<EOS>
In
a
strange
and
new
sense
,
I
grew
most
selfish
,
and
quite
powerless
to
deny
myself
the
delight
of
indulging
his
mood
,
and
being
pliant
to
his
will
.
<EOS>
He
still
seemed
to
me
most
absurd
when
he
obstinately
doubted
,
and
desponded
about
his
power
to
win
in
the
end
Miss
Fanshawe
's
preference
.
<EOS>
The
fancy
became
rooted
in
my
own
mind
more
stubbornly
than
ever
,
that
she
was
only
coquetting
to
goad
him
,
and
that
,
at
heart
,
she
coveted
everyone
of
his
words
and
looks
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
harassed
me
,
in
spite
of
my
resolution
to
bear
and
hear
;
in
the
midst
of
the
indescribable
gall
-
honey
pleasure
of
thus
bearing
and
hearing
,
he
struck
so
on
the
flint
of
what
firmness
I
owned
,
that
it
emitted
fire
once
and
again
.
<EOS>
I
chanced
to
assert
one
day
,
with
a
view
to
stilling
his
impatience
,
that
in
my
own
mind
,
I
felt
positive
Miss
Fanshawe
_
must
_
intend
eventually
to
accept
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Positive
!
<EOS>
It
was
easy
to
say
so
,
but
had
I
any
grounds
for
such
assurance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

Now
,
Lucy
,
_
do
_
tell
me
what
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
them
as
well
as
I
;
and
,
knowing
them
,
Dr.
John
,
it
really
amazes
me
that
you
should
not
repose
the
frankest
confidence
in
her
fidelity
.
<EOS>
To
doubt
,
under
the
circumstances
,
is
almost
to
insult
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
you
are
beginning
to
speak
fast
and
to
breathe
short
;
but
speak
a
little
faster
and
breathe
a
little
shorter
,
till
you
have
given
an
explanation
 
a
full
explanation
:
I
must
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
,
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
In
some
cases
,
you
are
a
lavish
,
generous
man
:
you
are
a
worshipper
ever
ready
with
the
votive
offering
<EOS>
should
Père
Silas
ever
convert
_
<EOS>
you
_
,
you
will
give
him
abundance
of
alms
for
his
poor
,
you
will
supply
his
altar
with
tapers
,
and
the
shrine
of
your
favourite
saint
you
will
do
your
best
to
enrich
:
Ginevra
,
Dr.
John
 
"
  
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
"
do
n't
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
I
will
_
not
_
:
and
go
on
I
_
<EOS>
will
<EOS>
_
:
Ginevra
has
had
her
hands
filled
from
your
hands
more
times
than
I
can
count
.
<EOS>
You
have
sought
for
her
the
costliest
flowers
;
you
have
busied
your
brain
in
devising
gifts
the
most
delicate
:
<EOS>
such
,
one
would
have
thought
,
as
only
a
woman
could
have
imagined
;
and
in
addition
,
Miss
Fanshawe
owns
a
set
of
ornaments
,
to
purchase
which
your
generosity
must
have
verged
on
extravagance
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
modesty
Ginevra
herself
had
never
evinced
in
this
matter
,
now
flushed
all
over
the
face
of
her
admirer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
destructively
snipping
a
skein
of
silk
with
my
scissors
.
<EOS>
"
I
offered
them
to
please
myself
:
<EOS>
I
felt
she
did
me
a
favour
in
accepting
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
did
more
than
a
favour
,
Dr.
John
:
she
pledged
her
very
honour
that
she
would
make
you
some
return
;
and
if
she
can
not
pay
you
in
affection
,
she
ought
to
hand
out
a
business
-
like
equivalent
,
in
the
shape
of
some
rouleaux
of
gold
pieces
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
n't
understand
her
;
she
is
far
too
disinterested
to
care
for
my
gifts
,
and
too
simple
-
minded
to
know
their
value
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
laughed
out
:
I
had
heard
her
adjudge
to
every
jewel
its
price
;
and
well
I
knew
money
-
embarrassment
,
money
-
schemes
;
money
's
worth
,
and
endeavours
to
realise
supplies
,
had
,
young
<EOS>
as
she
was
,
furnished
the
most
frequent
,
and
the
favourite
stimulus
of
her
thoughts
for
years
.
  
<EOS>
He
pursued
.
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
seen
her
whenever
I
have
laid
on
her
lap
some
trifle
;
so
cool
,
so
unmoved
:
<EOS>
no
eagerness
to
take
,
not
even
pleasure
in
contemplating
.
<EOS>
Just
from
amiable
reluctance
to
grieve
me
,
she
would
permit
the
bouquet
to
lie
beside
her
,
and
perhaps
consent
to
bear
it
away
.
<EOS>
Or
,
if
I
achieved
the
fastening
of
a
bracelet
on
her
ivory
arm
,
however
pretty
the
trinket
might
be
<EOS>
(
and
I
always
carefully
chose
what
seemed
to
_
me
_
pretty
,
and
what
of
course
was
not
valueless
)
,
the
glitter
never
dazzled
her
bright
eyes
:
she
would
hardly
cast
one
look
on
my
gift
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
of
course
,
not
valuing
it
,
she
would
unloose
,
and
return
it
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
for
such
a
repulse
she
was
too
good
-
natured
.
<EOS>
She
would
consent
to
seem
to
forget
what
I
had
done
,
and
retain
the
offering
with
lady
-
like
quiet
and
easy
oblivion
.
<EOS>
Under
such
circumstances
,
how
can
a
man
build
on
acceptance
of
his
presents
as
a
favourable
symptom
?
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
were
I
to
offer
her
all
I
have
,
and
she
to
take
it
,
such
is
her
incapacity
to
be
swayed
by
sordid
considerations
,
I
should
not
venture
to
believe
the
transaction
advanced
me
one
step
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dr.
John
,
"
I
began
,
"
Love
is
blind
;
"
but
just
then
a
blue
subtle
ray
sped
sideways
from
Dr.
John
's
eye
:
it
reminded
me
of
old
days
,
it
reminded
me
of
his
picture
:
it
half
led
me
to
think
that
part
,
at
least
,
of
his
professed
persuasion
of
Miss
Fanshawe
's
_
naïveté
_
was
assumed
;
it
led
me
dubiously
to
conjecture
that
perhaps
,
in
spite
of
his
passion
for
her
beauty
,
his
appreciation
of
her
foibles
might
possibly
be
less
mistaken
,
more
clear
-
sighted
,
than
from
his
general
language
was
presumable
.
<EOS>
After
all
it
might
be
only
a
chance
look
,
or
at
best
the
token
of
a
merely
momentary
impression
.
<EOS>
Chance
or
intentional
real
or
imaginary
,
it
closed
the
conversation
.
    
<EOS>
THE
CLEOPATRA
.
  
<EOS>
My
stay
at
La
Terrasse
was
prolonged
a
fortnight
beyond
the
close
of
the
vacation
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
's
kind
management
procured
me
this
respite
.
<EOS>
Her
son
having
one
day
delivered
the
dictum
that
"
Lucy
was
not
yet
strong
enough
to
go
back
to
that
den
of
a
pensionnat
,
"
she
at
once
drove
over
to
the
Rue
Fossette
,
had
an
interview
with
the
directress
,
and
procured
the
indulgence
,
on
the
plea
of
prolonged
rest
and
change
being
necessary
to
perfect
recovery
.
<EOS>
Hereupon
,
however
,
followed
an
attention
I
could
very
well
have
dispensed
with
,
viz
 
a
polite
call
from
Madame
Beck
.
  
<EOS>
That
lady
 
<EOS>
one
fine
day
 
actually
came
out
in
a
fiacre
as
far
as
the
château
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
had
resolved
within
herself
to
see
what
manner
of
place
Dr.
John
inhabited
.
<EOS>
Apparently
,
the
pleasant
site
and
neat
interior
surpassed
her
expectations
;
she
eulogized
all
she
saw
,
pronounced
the
blue
salon
"
une
pièce
magnifique
,
"
profusely
congratulated
me
on
the
acquisition
of
friends
,
"
tellement
dignes
,
aimables
,
et
respectables
,
"
turned
also
a
neat
compliment
in
my
favour
,
and
,
upon
Dr.
John
coming
in
,
ran
up
to
him
with
the
utmost
buoyancy
,
opening
at
the
same
time
such
a
fire
of
rapid
language
,
all
sparkling
with
felicitations
and
protestations
about
his
"
château
,
"
 
"
madame
sa
mère
,
la
digne
châtelaine
:
"
also
his
looks
;
which
,
indeed
,
were
very
flourishing
,
and
at
the
moment
additionally
embellished
by
the
good
-
natured
but
amused
smile
with
which
he
always
listened
to
Madame
's
fluent
and
florid
French
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
Madame
shone
in
her
very
best
phase
that
day
,
and
came
in
and
went
out
quite
a
living
catherine
-
wheel
of
compliments
,
delight
,
and
affability
.
<EOS>
Half
purposely
,
and
half
to
ask
some
question
about
school
-
business
,
I
followed
her
to
the
carriage
,
and
looked
in
after
she
was
seated
and
the
door
closed
.
<EOS>
In
that
brief
fraction
of
time
what
a
change
had
been
wrought
!
<EOS>
An
instant
ago
,
all
sparkles
and
jests
,
she
now
sat
sterner
than
a
judge
and
graver
than
a
sage
.
<EOS>
Strange
little
woman
!
  
<EOS>
I
went
back
and
teased
Dr.
John
about
Madame
's
devotion
to
him
.
<EOS>
How
he
laughed
!
<EOS>
What
fun
shone
in
his
eyes
as
he
recalled
some
of
her
fine
speeches
,
and
repeated
them
,
imitating
her
voluble
delivery
!
<EOS>
He
had
an
acute
sense
of
humour
,
and
was
the
finest
company
in
the
world
 
when
he
could
forget
Miss
Fanshawe
.
     
<EOS>
To
"
sit
in
sunshine
calm
and
sweet
"
is
said
to
be
excellent
for
weak
people
;
it
gives
them
vital
force
.
<EOS>
When
little
Georgette
Beck
was
recovering
from
her
illness
,
I
used
to
take
her
in
my
arms
and
walk
with
her
in
the
garden
by
the
hour
together
,
beneath
a
certain
wall
hung
with
grapes
,
which
the
Southern
sun
was
ripening
:
that
sun
cherished
her
little
pale
frame
quite
as
effectually
as
it
mellowed
and
swelled
the
clustering
fruit
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
human
tempers
,
bland
,
glowing
,
and
genial
,
within
whose
influence
it
is
as
good
for
the
poor
in
spirit
to
live
,
as
it
is
for
the
feeble
in
frame
to
bask
in
the
glow
of
noon
.
<EOS>
Of
the
number
of
these
choice
natures
were
certainly
both
Dr.
Bretton
's
and
his
mother
's
.
<EOS>
They
liked
to
communicate
happiness
,
as
some
like
to
occasion
misery
:
they
did
it
instinctively
;
without
fuss
,
and
apparently
with
little
consciousness
;
the
means
to
give
pleasure
rose
spontaneously
in
their
minds
.
<EOS>
Every
day
while
I
stayed
with
them
,
some
little
plan
was
proposed
which
resulted
in
beneficial
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
Fully
occupied
as
was
Dr.
John
's
time
,
he
still
made
it
in
his
way
to
accompany
us
in
each
brief
excursion
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
tell
how
he
managed
his
engagements
;
they
were
numerous
,
yet
by
dint
of
system
,
he
classed
them
in
an
order
which
left
him
a
daily
period
of
liberty
.
<EOS>
I
often
saw
him
hard
-
worked
,
yet
seldom
over
-
driven
,
and
never
irritated
,
confused
,
or
oppressed
.
<EOS>
What
he
did
was
accomplished
with
the
ease
and
grace
of
all
-
sufficing
strength
;
with
the
bountiful
cheerfulness
of
high
and
unbroken
energies
.
<EOS>
Under
his
guidance
I
saw
,
in
that
one
happy
fortnight
,
more
of
Villette
,
its
environs
,
and
its
inhabitants
,
than
I
had
seen
in
the
whole
eight
months
of
my
previous
residence
.
<EOS>
He
took
me
to
places
of
interest
in
the
town
,
of
whose
names
<EOS>
I
had
not
before
so
much
as
heard
;
with
willingness
and
spirit
he
communicates
much
noteworthy
information
.
<EOS>
He
never
seemed
to
think
it
a
trouble
to
talk
to
me
,
and
,
I
am
sure
,
it
was
never
a
task
to
me
to
listen
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
his
way
to
treat
subjects
coldly
and
vaguely
;
he
rarely
generalized
,
never
prosed
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
like
nice
details
almost
as
much
as
I
liked
them
myself
:
he
seemed
observant
of
character
:
and
not
superficially
observant
,
either
.
<EOS>
These
points
gave
the
quality
of
interest
to
his
discourse
;
and
the
fact
of
his
speaking
direct
from
his
own
resources
,
and
not
borrowing
or
stealing
from
books
 
here
a
dry
fact
,
and
there
a
trite
phrase
,
and
elsewhere
a
hackneyed
opinion
 
ensured
a
freshness
,
as
welcome
as
it
was
rare
.
<EOS>
Before
my
eyes
,
too
,
his
disposition
seemed
to
unfold
another
phase
;
to
pass
to
a
fresh
day
:
to
rise
in
new
and
nobler
dawn
.
  
<EOS>
His
mother
possessed
a
good
development
of
benevolence
,
but
he
owned
a
better
and
larger
.
<EOS>
I
found
,
on
accompanying
him
to
the
Basse
-
Ville
 
<EOS>
the
poor
and
crowded
quarter
of
the
city
 
<EOS>
that
his
errands
there
were
as
much
those
of
the
philanthropist
as
the
physician
.
<EOS>
I
understood
presently
that
cheerfully
,
habitually
,
and
in
single
-
minded
unconsciousness
of
any
special
merit
distinguishing
his
deeds
 
he
was
achieving
,
amongst
a
very
wretched
population
,
a
world
of
active
good
.
<EOS>
The
lower
orders
liked
him
well
;
his
poor
,
patients
in
the
hospitals
welcomed
him
with
a
sort
of
enthusiasm
.
  
<EOS>
But
stop
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
,
from
the
faithful
narrator
<EOS>
,
degenerate
into
the
partial
eulogist
.
<EOS>
Well
,
full
well
,
do
I
know
that
Dr.
John
was
not
perfect
,
anymore
than
I
am
perfect
.
<EOS>
Human
fallibility
leavened
him
throughout
:
there
was
no
hour
,
and
scarcely
a
moment
of
the
time
I
spent
with
him
that
in
act
or
speech
,
or
look
,
he
did
not
betray
something
that
was
not
of
a
god
.
<EOS>
A
god
could
not
have
the
cruel
vanity
of
Dr.
John
,
nor
his
sometime
levity
.
<EOS>
,
No
immortal
could
have
resembled
him
in
his
occasional
temporary
oblivion
of
all
but
the
present
 
in
his
passing
passion
for
that
present
;
shown
not
coarsely
,
by
devoting
it
to
material
indulgence
,
but
selfishly
,
by
extracting
from
it
whatever
it
could
yield
of
nutriment
to
his
masculine
self
-
love
:
his
delight
was
to
feed
that
ravenous
sentiment
,
without
thought
of
the
price
of
provender
,
or
care
for
the
cost
of
keeping
it
sleek
and
high
-
pampered
.
  
<EOS>
The
reader
is
requested
to
note
a
seeming
contradiction
in
the
two
views
which
have
been
given
of
Graham
Bretton
 
the
public
and
private
 
the
out
-
door
and
the
in
-
door
view
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
,
the
public
,
he
is
shown
oblivious
of
self
;
as
modest
in
the
display
of
his
energies
,
as
earnest
in
their
exercise
.
<EOS>
In
the
second
,
the
fireside
picture
,
there
is
expressed
consciousness
of
what
he
has
and
what
he
is
;
pleasure
in
homage
,
some
recklessness
in
exciting
,
some
vanity
in
receiving
the
same
.
<EOS>
Both
portraits
are
correct
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
hardly
possible
to
oblige
Dr.
John
quietly
and
in
secret
.
<EOS>
When
you
thought
that
the
fabrication
of
some
trifle
dedicated
to
his
use
had
been
achieved
unnoticed
,
and
that
,
like
other
men
,
he
would
use
it
when
placed
ready
for
his
use
,
and
never
ask
whence
it
came
,
he
amazed
you
by
a
smilingly
-
uttered
observation
or
two
,
proving
that
his
eye
had
been
on
the
work
from
commencement
to
close
:
that
he
had
noted
the
design
,
traced
its
progress
,
and
marked
its
completion
.
<EOS>
It
pleased
him
to
be
thus
served
,
and
he
let
his
pleasure
beam
in
his
eye
and
play
about
his
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
This
would
have
been
all
very
well
,
if
he
had
not
added
to
such
kindly
and
unobtrusive
evidence
a
certain
wilfulness
in
discharging
what
he
called
debts
.
<EOS>
When
his
mother
worked
for
him
,
he
paid
her
by
showering
about
her
his
bright
animal
spirits
,
with
even
more
affluence
than
his
gay
,
taunting
,

If
Lucy
Snowe
were
discovered
to
have
put
her
hand
to
such
work
,
he
planned
,
in
recompence
,
some
pleasant
recreation
.
  
<EOS>
I
often
felt
amazed
at
his
perfect
knowledge
of
Villette
;
a
knowledge
not
merely
confined
to
its
open
streets
,
but
penetrating
to
all
its
galleries
,
salles
,
and
cabinets
:
of
every
door
which
shut
in
an
object
worth
seeing
,
of
every
museum
,
of
every
hall
,
sacred
to
art
or
science
,
he
seemed
to
possess
the
"
Open
!
<EOS>
Sesame
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
had
a
head
for
science
,
but
an
ignorant
,
blind
,
fond
instinct
inclined
me
to
art
.
<EOS>
I
liked
to
visit
the
picture
-
galleries
,
and
I
dearly
liked
to
be
left
there
alone
.
<EOS>
In
company
,
a
wretched
idiosyncracy
forbade
me
to
see
much
or
to
feel
anything
.
<EOS>
In
unfamiliar
company
,
where
it
was
necessary
to
maintain
a
flow
of
talk
on
the
subjects
in
presence
,
half
an
hour
would
knock
me
up
,
with
a
combined
pressure
of
physical
lassitude
and
entire
mental
incapacity
.
<EOS>
I
never
yet
saw
the
well
-
reared
child
,
much
less
the
educated
adult
,
who
could
not
put
me
to
shame
,
by
the
sustained
intelligence
of
its
demeanour
under
the
ordeal
of
a
conversable
,
sociable
visitation
of
pictures
,
historical
sights
or
buildings
,
or
any
lions
of
public
interest
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Bretton
was
a
cicerone
after
my
own
heart
;
he
would
take
me
betimes
,
ere
the
galleries
were
filled
,
leave
me
there
for
two
or
three
hours
,
and
call
for
me
when
his
own
engagements
were
discharged
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
I
was
happy
;
happy
,
not
always
in
admiring
,
but
in
examining
,
questioning
,
and
forming
conclusions
.
<EOS>
In
the
commencement
of
these
visits
,
there
was
some
misunderstanding
and
consequent
struggle
between
Will
and
Power
.
<EOS>
The
former
faculty
exacted
approbation
of
that
which
it
was
considered
orthodox
to
admire
;
the
latter
groaned
forth
its
utter
inability
to
pay
the
tax
;
it
was
then
self
-
sneered
at
,
spurred
up
,
goaded
on
to
refine
its
taste
,
and
whet
its
zest
.
<EOS>
The
more
it
was
chidden
,
however
,
the
more
it
would
n't
praise
.
<EOS>
Discovering
gradually
that
a
wonderful
sense
of
fatigue
resulted
from
these
conscientious
efforts
,
I
began
to
reflect
whether
I
might
not
dispense
with
that
great
labour
,
and
concluded
eventually
that
I
might
,
and
so
sank
supine
into
a
luxury
of
calm
before
ninety
-
nine
out
of
a
hundred
of
the
exhibited
frames
.
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
me
that
an
original
and
good
picture
was
just
as
scarce
as
an
original
and
good
book
;
nor
did
I
,
in
the
end
,
tremble
to
say
to
myself
,
standing
before
certain
_
chef
-
d'oeuvres
<EOS>
_
bearing
great
names
,
"
These
are
not
a
whit
like
nature
.
<EOS>
Nature
's
daylight
never
had
that
colour
:
never
was
made
so
turbid
,
either
by
storm
or
cloud
,
as
it
is
laid
out
there
,
under
a
sky
of
indigo
:
and
that
indigo
is
not
ether
;
and
those
dark
weeds
plastered
upon
it
are
not
trees
.
<EOS>
"
Several
very
well
executed
and
complacent
-
looking
fat
women
struck
me
as
by
no
means
the
goddesses
they
appeared
to
consider
themselves
.
<EOS>
Many
scores
of
marvellously
-
finished
little
Flemish
pictures
,
and
also
of
sketches
,
excellent
for
fashion
-
books
displaying
varied
costumes
in
the
handsomest
materials
,
gave
evidence
of
laudable
industry
whimsically
applied
.
<EOS>
And
yet
there
were
fragments
of
truth
here
and
there
which
satisfied
the
conscience
,
and
gleams
of
light
that
cheered
the
vision
.
<EOS>
Nature
's
power
here
broke
through
in
a
mountain
snow
-
storm
;
and
there
her
glory
in
a
sunny
southern
day
.
<EOS>
An
expression
in
this
portrait
proved
clear
insight
into
character
;
a
face
in
that
historical
painting
,
by
its
vivid
filial
likeness
,
startlingly
reminded
you
that
genius
gave
it
birth
.
<EOS>
These
exceptions
I
loved
:
they
grew
dear
as
friends
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
,
at
a
quiet
early
hour
,
I
found
myself
nearly
alone
in
a
certain
gallery
,
wherein
one
particular
picture
of
portentous
size
,
set
up
in
the
best
light
,
having
a
cordon
of
protection
stretched
before
it
,
and
a
cushioned
bench
duly
set
in
front
for
the
accommodation
of
worshipping
connoisseurs
,
who
,
having
gazed
themselves
off
their
feet
,
might
be
fain
to
complete
the
business
sitting
:
this
picture
,
I
say
,
seemed
to
consider
itself
the
queen
of
the
collection
.
  
<EOS>
It
represented
a
woman
,
considerably
larger
,
I
thought
,
than
the
life
.
<EOS>
I
calculated
that
this
lady
,
put
into
a
scale
of
magnitude
,
suitable
for
the
reception
of
a
commodity
of
bulk
,
would
infallibly
turn
from
fourteen
to
sixteen
stone
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
indeed
,
extremely
well
fed
:
very
much
butcher
's
meat
 
to
say
nothing
of
bread
,
vegetables
,
and
liquids
 
must
she
have
consumed
to
attain
that
breadth
and
height
,
that
wealth
of
muscle
,
that
affluence
of
flesh
.
<EOS>
She
lay
half
-
reclined
on
a
couch
:
why
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
;
broad
daylight
blazed
round
her
;
she
appeared
in
hearty
health
,
strong
enough
to
do
the
work
of
two
plain
cooks
;
she
could
not
plead
a
weak
spine
;
she
ought
to
have
been
standing
,
or
at
least
sitting
bolt
upright
.
<EOS>
She
,
had
no
business
to
lounge
away
the
noon
on
a
sofa
.
<EOS>
She
ought
likewise
to
have
worn
decent
garments
;
a
gown
covering
her
properly
,
which
was
not
the
case
:
out
of
abundance
of
material
 
seven
-
and
-
twenty
yards
,
I
should
say
,
of
drapery
 
she
managed
to
make
inefficient
raiment
.
<EOS>
Then
,
for
the
wretched
untidiness
surrounding
her
,
there
could
be
no
excuse
.
<EOS>
Pots
and
pans
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
ought
to
say
vases
and
goblets
 
were
rolled
here
and
there
on
the
foreground
;
a
perfect
rubbish
of
flowers
was
mixed
amongst
them
,
and
an
absurd
and
disorderly
mass
of
curtain
upholstery
smothered
the
couch
and
cumbered
the
floor
.
<EOS>
On
referring
to
the
catalogue
,
I
found
that
this
notable
production
bore
the
name
"
Cleopatra
.
"
  
<EOS>
Well
,
I
was
sitting
wondering
at
it
(
as
the
bench
was
there
,
I
thought
I
might
as
well
take
advantage
of
its
accommodation
)
,
and
thinking
that
while
some
of
the
details
 
as
roses
,
gold
cups
,
jewels
,
&
c.
,
were
very
prettily
painted
,
it
was
on
the
whole
an
enormous
piece
of
claptrap
;
the
room
,
almost
vacant
when
I
entered
,
began
to
fill
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
noticing
this
circumstance
(
as
,
indeed
,
it
did
not
matter
to
me
)
<EOS>
I
retained
my
seat
;
rather
to
rest
myself
than
with
a
view
to
studying
this
huge
,
dark
-
complexioned
gipsy
-
queen
;
of
whom
,
indeed
,
I
soon
tired
,
and
betook
myself
for
refreshment
to
the
contemplation
of
some
exquisite
little
pictures
of
still
life
:
wild
-
flowers
,
wild
-
fruit
,
mossy
woodnests
,
casketing
eggs
that
looked
like
pearls
seen
through
clear
green
sea
-
water
;
all
hung
modestly
beneath
that
coarse
and
preposterous
canvas
.
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
a
light
tap
visited
my
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Starting
,
turning
,
I
met
a
face
bent
to
encounter
mine
;
a
frowning
,
almost
a
shocked
face
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
Que
faites
-
vous
ici
?
"
said
a
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mais
,
Monsieur
,
je
m'amuse
.
"
  
"
Vous
vous
amusez

<EOS>
et
<EOS>
à
quoi
<EOS>
,
s'il
vous

<EOS>
Mais
d'abord
,
faites
-
moi
le
plaisir
de
vous
lever
;
prenez
mon
bras
,
et
allons
de
l'autre
côté
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
precisely
as
I
was
bid
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
Emanuel
(
it
was
he
)
returned
from
Rome
,
and
now
a
travelled
man
,
was
not
likely
to
be
less
tolerant
of
insubordination
now
,
than
before
this
added
distinction
laurelled
his
temples
.
  
<EOS>
"
Permit
me
to
conduct
you
to
your
party
,
"
said
he
,
as
we
crossed
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
alone

"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Monsieur

"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
come
here
unaccompanied
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Monsieur
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Bretton
brought
me
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dr.
Bretton
and
Madame
his
mother
,
of
course
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
only
Dr.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
told
you
to
look
at
_
that
_
picture
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
;
I
found
it
out
for
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
M.
Paul
's
hair
was
shorn
close
as
raven
down
,
or
I
think
it
would
have
bristled
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
Beginning
now
to
perceive
his
drift
,
I
had
a
certain
pleasure
in
keeping
cool
,
and
working
him
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Astounding
insular
audacity
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
Professor
.
<EOS>
"
Singulières

Anglaises

"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
,
Monsieur

"
  
<EOS>
"
Matter

<EOS>
How
dare
you
,
a
young
person
,
sit
coolly
down
,
with
the
self
-
possession
of
a
garçon
,
and
look
at
_
that
_
picture
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
very
ugly
picture
,
but
I
can
not
at
all
see
why
I
should
not
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bon

bon

<EOS>
Speak
no
more
of
it

<EOS>
But
you
ought
not
to
be
here
alone

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
,
however
,
I
have
no
society
 
<EOS>
no
_
party

,
as
you
say
?
<EOS>
And
then
,
what
does
it
signify
whether
I
am
alone

accompanied

<EOS>
nobody
meddles
with
me

"
  
<EOS>
"
Taisez

down

dreary

Quel

<EOS>
cried
I
,
"
et
quelles
laids
tableaux

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
"
laids
,
"
indeed
,
they
were
;
<EOS>
being
a
set
of
four
,
denominated
in
the
catalogue
"
La
vie
d'une
femme
.
<EOS>
"
They
were
painted
rather
in
a
remarkable
style
 
flat
,
dead
,
pale
,
and
formal
.
<EOS>
The
first
represented
a
"
Jeune
Fille
,
"
coming
out
of
a
church
-
door
,
a
missal
in
her
hand
,
her
dress
very
prim
,
her
eyes
cast
down
,
her
mouth
pursed
up
 
the
image
of
a
most
villanous
little
precocious
she
-
hypocrite
.
<EOS>
The
second
,
a
"
Mariée
,
"
with
a
long
white
veil
,
kneeling
at
a
prie
-
dieu
in
her
chamber
,
holding
her
hands
plastered
together
,
finger
to
finger
,
and
showing
the
whites
of
her
eyes
in
a
most
exasperating
manner
.
<EOS>
The
third
,
a
"
Jeune
Mère
,
"
hanging
disconsolate
over
a
clayey
and
puffy
baby
with
a
face
like
an
unwholesome
full
moon
.
<EOS>
The
fourth
,
a
"
Veuve
,
"
being
a
black
woman
,
holding
by
the
hand
a
black
little
girl
,
and
the
twain
studiously
surveying
an
elegant
French
monument
,
set
up
in
a
corner
of
some
Père
la
Chaise
.
<EOS>
All
these
four
"
Anges
"
were
grim
and
grey
as
burglars
,
and
cold
and
vapid
as
ghosts
.
<EOS>
What
women
to
live
with
!
<EOS>
insincere
,
ill
-
humoured
,
bloodless
,
brainless
nonentities
!
<EOS>
As
bad
in
their
way
as
the
indolent
gipsy
-
giantess
,
the
Cleopatra
,
in
hers
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
keep
one
's
attention
long
confined
to
these
master
-
pieces
,
and
so
,
by
degrees
,
I
veered
round
,
and
surveyed
the
gallery
.
  
<EOS>
A
perfect
crowd
of
spectators
was
by
this
time
gathered
round
the
Lioness
,
from
whose
vicinage
I
had
been
banished
;
nearly
half
this
crowd
were
ladies
,
but
M.
Paul
afterwards
told
me
,
these
were
"
des
dames
,
"
and
it
was
quite
proper
for
them
to
contemplate
what
no
"
demoiselle
"
ought
to
glance
at
.
<EOS>
I
assured
him
plainly
I
could
not
agree
in
this
doctrine
,
and
did
not
see
the
sense
of
it
;
<EOS>
whereupon
,
with
his
usual
absolutism
,
he
merely
requested
my
silence
,
and
also
,
in
the
same
breath
,
denounced
my
mingled
rashness
and
ignorance
.
<EOS>
A
more
despotic
little
man
than
M.
Paul
never
filled
a
professor
's
chair
.
<EOS>
I
noticed
,
by
the
way
,
that
he
looked
at
the
picture
himself
quite
at
his
ease
,
and
for
a
very
long
while
:
he
did
not
,
however
,
neglect
to
glance
from
time
to
time
my
way
,
in
order
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
to
make
sure
that
I
was
obeying
orders
,
and
not
breaking
bounds
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
,
he
again
accosted
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Had
I
not
been
ill
?
"
<EOS>
he
wished
to
know
:
"
he
understood
I
had
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
I
was
now
quite
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
had
I
spent
the
vacation
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Chiefly
in
the
Rue
Fossette
;
partly
with
Madame
Bretton
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
had
heard
that
I
was
left
alone
in
the
Rue
Fossette
;
was
that
so
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
quite
alone
<EOS>
:
Marie
Broc
"
(
the
crétin
)
"
was
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
;
varied
and
contradictory
expressions
played
rapidly
over
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
Marie
Broc
was
well
known
to
M.
Paul
;
he
never
gave
a
lesson
in
the
third
division
(
containing
the
least
advanced

)
,
that
she
did
not
occasion
in
him
a
sharp
conflict
between
antagonistic
impressions
.
<EOS>
Her
personal
appearance
,
her
repulsive
manners
,
her
often
unmanageable
disposition
,
irritated
his
temper
,
and
inspired
him
with
strong
antipathy
;
a
feeling
he
was
too
apt
to
conceive
when
his
taste
was
offended
or
his
will
thwarted
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
her
misfortunes
,
constituted
a
strong
claim
on
his
forbearance
and
compassion
 
such
a
claim
as
it
was
not
in
his
nature
to
deny
;
hence
resulted
almost
daily
drawn
battles
between
impatience
and
disgust
on
the
one
hand
,
pity
and
a
sense
of
justice
on
the
other
;
in
which
,
to
his
credit
be
it
said
,
it
was
very
seldom
that
the
former
feelings
prevailed
:
<EOS>
when
they
did
,
however
,
M.
Paul
showed
a
phase
of
character
which
had
its
terrors
.
<EOS>
His
passions
were
strong
,
his
aversions
and
attachments
alike
vivid
;
the
force
he
exerted
in
holding
both
in
check
by
no
means
mitigated
an
observer
's
sense
of
their
vehemence
.
<EOS>
With
such
tendencies
,
it
may
well
be
supposed
he
often
excited
in
ordinary
minds
fear
and
dislike
;
yet
it
was
an
error
to
fear
him
:
<EOS>
nothing
drove
him
so
nearly
frantic
as
the
tremor
of
an
apprehensive
and
distrustful
spirit
;
nothing
soothed
him
like
confidence
tempered
with
gentleness
.
<EOS>
To
evince
these
sentiments
,
however
,
required
a
thorough
comprehension
of
his
nature
;
and
his
nature
was
of
an
order
rarely
comprehended
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
did
you
get
on
with
Marie
Broc
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
,
after
some
minutes
'
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
I
did
my
best
;
but
it
was
terrible
to
be
alone
with
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
,
then
,
a
weak
heart
!
<EOS>
You
lack
courage
;
and
,
perhaps
,
charity
.
<EOS>
Yours
are
not
the
qualities
which
might
constitute
a
Sister
of
Mercy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
indeed
:
I
took
as
good
care
of
her
as
I
could
;
but
when
her
aunt
came
to
fetch
her
away
,
it
was
a
great
relief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
are
an
egotist
.
<EOS>
There
are
women
who
have
nursed
hospitals
-
full
of
similar
unfortunates
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
do
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Could
Monsieur
do
it
himself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Women
who
are
worthy
the
name
ought
infinitely
to
surpass
;
our
coarse
,
fallible
,
self
-
indulgent
sex
,
in
the
power
to
perform
such
duties
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
washed
her
,
I
kept
her
clean
,
I
fed
her
,
I
tried
to
amuse
her
;
but
she
made
mouths
at
me
instead
of
speaking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
you
did
great
things
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
;
but
as
great
as
I
_
could
_
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
limited
are
your
powers
,
for
in
tending
one
idiot
you
fell
sick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
with
that
,
Monsieur
;
I
had
a
nervous
fever
:
<EOS>
my
mind
was
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Vraiment
!
<EOS>
Vous
valez
peu
de
chose

<EOS>
You
are
not
cast
in
an
heroic
mould
;
your
courage
will
not
avail
to
sustain
you
in
solitude
;
it
merely
gives
you
the
temerity
to
gaze
with
sang
-
froid
at
pictures
of
Cleopatra
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
easy
to
show
anger
at
the
teasing
,
hostile
tone
of
the
little
man
.
<EOS>
I
had
never
been
angry
with
him
yet
,
however
,
and
had
no
present
disposition
to
begin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cleopatra
!
"
<EOS>
I
repeated
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
too
,
has
been
looking
at
Cleopatra
;
what
does
he
think
of
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cela
ne

"
he
responded
.
<EOS>
"
Une

<EOS>
"
But
I
have
looked
at
her
a
great
many
times
while
Monsieur
has
been
talking

I
can
see
her
quite
well
from
this
corner

<EOS>
"
Turn
to
the

your

's
life

"
  
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
M.
Paul
;
they
are
too
hideous

if
you
admire
them
,
allow

leave
you

their
contemplation

<EOS>
"

he
said
,
grimacing
a
half
-
smile
,
or
what
he
intended
for
a
smile
,
though
it
was
but
a
grim
and
hurried

I
believe
,
if
some

were
thrown
into
Nebuchadnezzar

you
would
issue
forth
untraversed

the
goodness

move
an
inch

"
How
!
<EOS>
At
what
are
you
gazing
now
?
<EOS>
You
are
not
recognising
an
acquaintance
amongst
that
group
of
jeunes
gens
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
see
there
a
person
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
fact
,
I
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
head
too
pretty
to
belong
to
any
other
than
the
redoubted
Colonel
de
Hamal
.
<EOS>
What
a
very
finished
,
highly
polished
little
pate
it
was
!
<EOS>
What
a
figure
,
so
trim
and
natty
!
<EOS>
What
womanish
feet
and
hands
!
<EOS>
How
daintily
he
held
a
glass
to
one
of
his
optics
!
<EOS>
with
what
admiration
he
gazed
upon
the
Cleopatra
!
<EOS>
and
then
,
how
engagingly
he
tittered
and
whispered
a
friend
at
his
elbow
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
man
of
sense
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
refined
gentleman
of
superior
taste
and
tact
!
<EOS>
I
observed
him
for
about
ten
minutes
,
and
perceived
that
he
was
exceedingly
taken
with
this
dusk
and
portly
Venus
of
the
Nile
.
<EOS>
So
much
was
I
interested
in
his
bearing
,
so
absorbed
in
divining
his
character
by
his
looks
and
movements
,
I
temporarily
forgot
M.
Paul
;
in
the
interim
a
group
came
between
that
gentleman
and
me
;
or
possibly
his
scruples
might
have
received
another
and
worse
shock
from
my
present
abstraction
,
causing
him
to
withdraw
voluntarily
:
at
any
rate
,
when
I
again
looked
round
,
he
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
My
eye
,
pursuant
of
the
search
,
met
not
him
,
but
another
and
dissimilar
figure
,
<EOS>
well
seen
amidst
the
crowd
,
for
the
height
as
well
as
the
port
lent
each
its
distinction
.
<EOS>
This
way
came
Dr.
John
,
in
visage
,
in
shape
,
in
hue
,
as
unlike
the
dark
,
acerb
,
and
caustic
little
professor
,
as
the
fruit
of
the
Hesperides
might
be
unlike
the
sloe
in
the
wild
thicket
;
as
the
high
-
couraged
but
tractable
Arabian
is
unlike
the
rude
and
stubborn
"
sheltie
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
looking
for
me
,
but
had
not
yet
explored
the
corner
where
the
schoolmaster
had
just
put
me
.
<EOS>
I
remained
quiet
;
yet
another
minute
I
would
watch
.
  
<EOS>
He
approached
de
Hamal
;
he
paused
near
him
;
I
thought
he
had
a
pleasure
in
looking
over
his
head
;
Dr.
Bretton
,
too
,
gazed
on
the
Cleopatra
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
it
were
to
his
taste
:
he
did
not
simper
like
the
little
Count
;
his
mouth
looked
fastidious
,
his
eye
cool
;
without
demonstration
he
stepped
aside
,
leaving
room
for
others
to
approach
.
<EOS>
I
saw
now
that
he
was
waiting
,
and
,
rising
,
I
joined
him
.
  
<EOS>
We
took
one
turn
round
the
gallery
;
with
Graham
it
was
very
pleasant
to
take
such
a
turn
.
<EOS>
I
always
liked
dearly
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
about
either
pictures
or
books
;
because
without
pretending
to
be
a
connoisseur
,
he
always
spoke
his
thought
,
and
that
was
sure
to
be
fresh
:
very
often
it
was
also
just
and
pithy
.
<EOS>
It
was
pleasant
also
to
tell
him
some
things
he
did
not
know
 
<EOS>
he
listened
so
kindly
,
so
teachably
;
unformalized
by
scruples
lest
so
to
bend
his
bright
handsome
head
,
to
gather
a
woman
's
rather
obscure
and
stammering
explanation
,
<EOS>
should
imperil
the
dignity
of
his
manhood
.
<EOS>
And
when
he
communicated
information
in
return
,
it
was
with
a
lucid
intelligence
that
left
all
his
words
clear
graven
on
the
memory
;
no
explanation
of
his
giving
,
no
fact
of
his
narrating
,
did
I
ever
forget
.
  
<EOS>
As
we
left
the
gallery
,
I
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
the
Cleopatra
(
after
making
him
laugh
by
telling
him
how
Professor
Emanuel
had
sent
me
to
the
right
about
,
and
taking
him
to
see
the
sweet
series
of
pictures
recommended
to
my
attention
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
mother
is
a
better
-
looking
woman
.
<EOS>
I
heard
some
French
fops
,
yonder
,
designating
her
as
"
le
type
du
voluptueux
;
"
if
so
,
I
can
only
say
,
"
le
voluptueux
"
is
little
to
my
liking
.
<EOS>
Compare
that
mulatto
with
Ginevra

THE
CONCERT
.
  
<EOS>
One
morning
,
Mrs.
Bretton
,
coming
promptly
into
my
room
,
desired
me
to
open
my
drawers
and
show
her
my
dresses
;
which
I
did
,
without
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
will
do
,
"
said
she
,
when
she
had
turned
them
over
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
a
new
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
went
out
.
<EOS>
She
returned
presently
with
a
dressmaker
.
<EOS>
She
had
me
measured
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
"
said
she
,
"
to
follow
my
own
taste
,
and
to
have
my
own
way
in
this
little
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Two
days
after
came
home
 
a
pink
dress
!
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
for
me
,
"
I
said
,
hurriedly
,
feeling
that
I
would
almost
as
soon
clothe
myself
in
the
costume
of
a
Chinese
lady
of
rank
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
whether
it
is
for
you
or
not
,
"
rejoined
my
godmother
,
adding
with
her
resistless
decision
:
"
Mark
my
words
.
<EOS>
You
will
wear
it
this
very
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
I
should
not
;
I
thought
no
human
force
should
avail
to
put
me
into
it
.
<EOS>
A
pink
dress
!
<EOS>
I
knew
it
not
.
<EOS>
It
knew
not
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
proved
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
godmother
went
on
to
decree
that
I
was
to
go
with
her
and
Graham
to
a
concert
that
same
night
:
which
concert
,
she
explained
,
was
a
grand
affair
to
be
held
in
the
large
salle
,
or
hall
,
of
the
principal
musical
society
.
<EOS>
The
most
advanced
of
the
pupils
of
the
Conservatoire
were
to
perform
:
it
was
to
be
followed
by
a
lottery
"
au
bénéfice
des
pauvres
;
"
and
to
crown
all
,
<EOS>
the
King
,
Queen
,
and
Prince
of
Labassecour
were
to
be
present
.
<EOS>
Graham
,
in
sending
tickets
,
had
enjoined
attention
to
costume
as
a
compliment
due
to
royalty
:
he
also
recommended
punctual
readiness
by
seven
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
About
six
,
I
was
ushered
upstairs
.
<EOS>
Without
any
force
at
all
,
I
found
myself
led
and
influenced
by
another
's
will
,
unconsulted
,
unpersuaded
,
quietly
overruled
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
pink
dress
went
on
,
softened
by
some
drapery
of
black
lace
.
<EOS>
I
was
pronounced
to
be
en
grande
tenue
,
and
requested
to
look
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
I
did
so
with
some
fear
and
trembling
;
with
more
fear
and
trembling
,
I
turned
away
.
<EOS>
Seven
o'clock
struck
;
Dr.
Bretton
was
come
;
my
godmother
and
I
went
down
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
was
clad
in
brown
velvet
;
as
I
walked
in
her
shadow
,
how
I
envied
her
those
folds
of
grave
,
dark
majesty
!
<EOS>
Graham
stood
in
the
drawing
-
room
doorway
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
do
_
hope
he
will
not
think
I
have
been
decking
myself
out
to
draw
attention
,
"
was
my
uneasy
aspiration
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
Lucy
,
are
some
flowers
,
"
said
he
,
giving
me
a
bouquet
.
<EOS>
He
took
no
further
notice
of
my
dress
than
was
conveyed
in
a
kind
smile
and
satisfied
nod
,
which
calmed
at
once
my
sense
of
shame
and
fear
of
ridicule
.
<EOS>
For
the
rest
;
the
dress
was
made
with
extreme
simplicity
,
guiltless
of
flounce
or
furbelow
;
it
was
but
the
light
fabric
and
bright
tint
which
scared
me
,
and
since
Graham
found
in
it
nothing
absurd
,
my
own
eye
consented
soon
to
become
reconciled
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
people
who
go
every
night
to
places
of
public
amusement
,
can
hardly
enter
into
the
fresh
gala
feeling
with
which
an
opera
or
a
concert
is
enjoyed
by
those
for
whom
it
is
a
rarity
:
I
am
not
sure
that
I
expected
great
pleasure
from
the
concert
,
having
but
a
very
vague
notion
of
its
nature
,
but
I
liked
the
drive
there
well
.
<EOS>
The
snug
comfort
of
the
close
carriage
on
a
cold
though
fine
night
,
the
pleasure
of
setting
out
with
companions
so
cheerful
and
friendly
,
the
sight
of
the
stars
glinting
fitfully
through
the
trees
as
we
rolled
along
the
avenue
;
then
the
freer
burst
of
the
night
-
sky
when
we
issued
forth
to
the
open
chaussée
,
the
passage
through
the
city
gates
,
the
lights
there
burning
,
the
guards
there
posted
,
the
pretence
of
inspection
,
to
which
we
there
submitted
,
and
which
amused
us
so
much
 
<EOS>
all
these
small
matters
had
for
me
,
in
their
novelty
,
a
peculiarly
exhilarating
charm
.
<EOS>
How
much
of
it
lay
in
the
atmosphere
of
friendship
diffused
about
me
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
:
Dr.
John
and
his
mother
were
both
in
their
finest
mood
,
contending
animatedly
with
each
other
the
whole
way
,
and
as
frankly
kind
to
me
as
if
I
had
been
of
their
kin
.
  
<EOS>
Our
way
lay
through
some
of
the
best
streets
of
Villette
,
streets
brightly
lit
,
and
far
more
lively
now
than
at
high
noon
.
<EOS>
How
brilliant
seemed
the
shops
!
<EOS>
How
glad
,
gay
,
and
abundant
flowed
the
tide
of
life
along
the
broad
pavement
!
<EOS>
While
I
looked
,
the
thought
of
the
Rue
Fossette
came
across
me
 
of
the
walled
-
in
garden
and
school
-
house
,
and
of
the
dark
,
vast
"
classes
,
"
where
,
as
at
this
very
hour
,
it
was
my
wo
nt
to
wander
all
solitary
,
gazing
at
the
stars
through
the
high
,
blindless
windows
,
and
listening
to
the
distant
voice
of
the
reader
in
the
refectory
,
monotonously
exercised
upon
the
"
lecture
pieuse
.
"
<EOS>
Thus
must
I
soon
again
listen
and
wander
;
and
this
shadow
of
the
future
stole
with
timely
sobriety
across
the
radiant
present
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
we
had
got
into
a
current
of
carriages
all
tending
in
one
direction
,
and
soon
the
front
of
a
great
illuminated
building
blazed
before
us
.
<EOS>
Of
what
I
should
see
within
this
building
,
I
had
,
as
before
intimated
,
but
an
imperfect
idea
;
for
no
place
of
public
entertainment
had
it
ever
been
my
lot
to
enter
yet
.
  
<EOS>
We
alighted
under
a
portico
where
there
was
a
great
bustle
and
a
great
crowd
,
but
I
do
not
distinctly
remember
further
details
,
until
I
found
myself
mounting
a
majestic
staircase
wide
and
easy
of
ascent
,
deeply
and
softly
carpeted
with
crimson
,
leading
up
to
great
doors
closed
solemnly
,
and
whose
panels
were
also
crimson
-
clothed
.
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
noticed
by
what
magic
these
doors
were
made
to
roll
back
 
<EOS>
Dr.
John
managed
these
points
;
roll
back
they
did
,
however
,
and
within
was
disclosed
a
hall
 
grand
,
wide
,
and
high
,
whose
sweeping
circular
walls
,
and
domed
hollow
ceiling
,
seemed
to
me
all
dead
gold
(
thus
with
nice
art
was
it
stained
)
,
relieved
by
cornicing
,
fluting
,
and
garlandry
,
either
bright
,
like
gold
burnished
,
or
snow
-
white
,
like
alabaster
,
or
white
and
gold
mingled
in
wreaths
of
gilded
leaves
and
spotless
lilies
:
wherever
drapery
hung
,
wherever
carpets
were
spread
,
or
cushions
placed
,
the
sole
colour
employed
was
deep
crimson
.
<EOS>
Pendent
from
the
dome
,
flamed
a
mass
that
dazzled
me
 
a
mass
,
I
thought
,
of
rock
-
crystal
,
sparkling
with
facets
,
streaming
with
drops
,
ablaze
with
stars
,
and
gorgeously
tinged
with
dews
of
gems
dissolved
,
or
fragments
of
rainbows
shivered
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
the
chandelier
,
reader
,
but
for
me
it
seemed
the
work
of
eastern
genii
<EOS>
:
I
almost
looked
to
see
if
a
huge
,
dark
,
cloudy
hand
 
<EOS>
that
of
the
Slave
of
the
Lamp
 
were
not
hovering
in
the
lustrous
and
perfumed
atmosphere
of
the
cupola
,
guarding
its
wondrous
treasure
.
  
<EOS>
We
moved
on
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
<EOS>
at
all
conscious
whither
 
<EOS>
but
at
some
turn
we
suddenly
encountered
another
party
approaching
from
the
opposite
direction
.
<EOS>
I
just
now
see
that
group
,
as
it
flashed
 
upon
me
for
one
moment
.
<EOS>
A
handsome
middle
-
aged
lady
in
dark
velvet
;
a
gentleman
who
might
be
her
son
 
the
best
face
,
the
finest
figure
,
I
thought
,
I
had
ever
seen
;
a
third
person
in
a
pink
dress
and
black
lace
mantle
.
  
<EOS>
I
noted
them
all
 
the
third
person
as
well
as
the
other
two
 
and
for
the
fraction
of
a
moment
believed
them
all
strangers
,
thus
receiving
an
impartial
impression
of
their
appearance
.
<EOS>
But
the
impression
was
hardly
felt
and
not
fixed
,
before
the
consciousness
that
I
faced
a
great
mirror
,
filling
a
compartment
between
two
pillars
,
dispelled
it
:
the
party
was
our
own
party
.
<EOS>
Thus
for
the
first
,
and
perhaps
only
time
in
my
life
,
I
enjoyed
the
"
giftie
"
of
seeing
myself
as
others
see
me
.
<EOS>
No
need
to
dwell
on
the
result
.
<EOS>
It
brought
a
jar
of
discord
,
a
pang
of
regret
;
it
was
not
flattering
,
yet
,
after
all
,
I
ought
to
be
thankful
;
it
might
have
been
worse
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
we
were
seated
in
places
commanding
a
good
general
view
of
that
vast
and
dazzling
,
but
warm
and
cheerful
hall
.
<EOS>
Already
it
was
filled
,
and
filled
with
a
splendid
assemblage
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
the
women
were
very
beautiful
,
but
their
dresses
were
so
perfect
;
and
foreigners
,
even
such
as
are
ungraceful
in
domestic
privacy
,
seem
to
posses
the
art
of
appearing
graceful
in
public
:
however
blunt
and
boisterous
those
every
-
day
and
home
movements
connected
with
peignoir
and
papillotes
,
there
is
a
slide
,
a
bend
,
a
carriage
of
the
head
and
arms
,
a
mien
of
the
mouth
and
eyes
,
kept
nicely
in
reserve
for
gala
use
 
always
brought
out
with
the
grande
toilette
,
and
duly
put
on
with
the
"
parure
.
"
  
<EOS>
Some
fine
forms
there
were
here
and
there
,
models
of
a
peculiar
style
of
beauty
;
a
style
,
I
think
,
never
seen
in
England
;
a
solid
,
firm
-
set
,
sculptural
style
.
<EOS>
These
shapes
have
no
angles
:
a
caryatid
in
marble
is
almost
as
flexible
;
a
Phidian
goddess
is
not
more
perfect
in
a
certain
still
and
stately
sort
.
<EOS>
They
have
such
features
as
the
Dutch
painters
give
to
their
madonnas
:
low
-
country
classic
features
,
regular
but
round
,
straight
but
stolid
;
and
for
their
depth
of
expressionless
calm
,
of
passionless
peace
,
a
polar
snow
-
field
could
alone
offer
a
type
.
<EOS>
Women
of
this
order
need
no
ornament
,
and
they
seldom
wear
any
;
the
smooth
hair
,
closely
braided
,
supplies
a
sufficient
contrast
to
the
smoother
cheek
and
brow
;
the
dress
can
not
be
too
simple
;
the
rounded
arm
and
perfect
neck
require
neither
bracelet
nor
chain
.
  
<EOS>
With
one
of
these
beauties
I
once
had
the
honour
and
rapture
to
be
perfectly
acquainted
:
the
inert
force
of
the
deep
,
settled
love
she
bore
herself
,
was
wonderful
;
it
could
only
be
surpassed
by
her
proud
impotency
to
care
for
any
other
living
thing
.
<EOS>
Of
blood
,
her
cool
veins
conducted
no
flow
;
placid
lymph
filled
and
almost
obstructed
her
arteries
.
  
<EOS>
Such
a
Juno
as
I
have
described
sat
full
in
our
view
 
a
sort
of
mark
for
all
eyes
,
and
quite
conscious
that
so
she
was
,
but
proof
to
the
magnetic
influence
of
gaze
or
glance
:
cold
,
rounded
,
blonde
,
and
beauteous
as
the
white
column
,
capitalled
with
gilding
,
which
rose
at
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
Observing
that
Dr.
John
's
attention
was
much
drawn
towards
her
,
I
entreated
him
in
a
low
voice
"
for
the
love
of
heaven
to
shield
well
his
heart
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
fall
in
love
with
_
that
_
lady
,
"
I
said
,
"
because
,
I
tell
you
beforehand
,
you
might
die
at
her
feet
,
and
she
would
not
love
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
how
do
you
know
that
the
spectacle
of
her
grand
insensibility
might
not
with
me
be
the
strongest
stimulus
to
homage
?
<EOS>
The
sting
of
desperation
is
,
I
think
,
a
wonderful
irritant
to
my
emotions
:
but
"
(
shrugging
his
shoulders
)
"
you
know
nothing
about
these
things
;
I
'll
address
myself
to
my
mother
.
<EOS>
Mamma
,
I
'm
in
a
dangerous
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
if
that
interested
me
!
"
said
Mrs.
Bretton
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
the
cruelty
of
my
lot
!
"
responded
her
son
.
<EOS>
"
Never
man
had
a
more
unsentimental
mother
than
mine
:
she
never
seems
to
think
that
such
a
calamity
can
befall
her
as
a
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
do
n't
,
it
is
not
for
want
of
having
that
same
calamity
held
over
my
head
:
you
have
threatened
me
with
it
for
the
last
ten
years
.
<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
I
am
going
to
be
married
soon
!
"
<EOS>
was
the
cry
before
you
were
well
out
of
jackets
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
mother
,
one
of
these
days
it
will
be
realized
.
<EOS>
All
of
a
sudden
,
when
you
think
you
are
most
secure
,
I
shall
go
forth
like
Jacob
or
Esau
,
or
any
other
patriarch
,
and
take
me
a
wife
:
perhaps
of
these
which
are
of
the
daughters
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
your
peril
,
John
Graham
!
<EOS>
that
is
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
mother
of
mine
means
me
to
be
an
old
bachelor
.
<EOS>
What
a
jealous
old
lady
it
is
!
<EOS>
But
now
just
look
at
that
splendid
creature
in
the
pale
blue
satin
dress
,
and
hair
of
paler
brown
,
with
"
reflets
satinés
'
as
those
of
her
robe
.
<EOS>
Would
you
not
feel
proud
,
mamma
,
if
I
were
to
bring
that
goddess
home
some
day
,
and
introduce
her
to
you
as
Mrs.
Bretton
,
junior
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
bring
no
goddess
to
La
Terrasse
:
that
little
château
will
not
contain
two
mistresses
;
especially
if
the
second
be
of
the
height
,
bulk
,
and
circumference
of
that
mighty
doll
in
wood
and
wax
,
and
kid
and
satin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
she
would
fill
your
blue
chair
so
admirably
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fill
my
chair
?
<EOS>
I
defy
the
foreign
usurper
!
<EOS>
a
rueful
chair
should
it
be
for
her
:
but
hush
,
John
Graham
!
<EOS>
Hold
your
tongue
,
and
use
your
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
During
the
above
skirmish
,
the
hall
,
which
,
I
had
thought
,
seemed
full
at
the
entrance
,
continued
to
admit
party
after
party
,
until
the
semicircle
before
the
stage
presented
one
dense
mass
of
heads
,
sloping
from
floor
to
ceiling
.
<EOS>
The
stage
,
too
,
or
rather
the
wide
temporary
platform
,
larger
than
any
stage
,
desert
half
an
hour
since
,
was
now
overflowing
with
life
;
round
two
grand
pianos
,
placed
about
the
centre
,
a
white
flock
of
young
girls
,
the
pupils
of
the
Conservatoire
,
had
noiselessly
poured
.
<EOS>
I
had
noticed
their
gathering
,
while
Graham
and
his
mother
were
engaged
in
discussing
the
belle
in
blue
satin
,
and
had
watched
with
interest
the
process
of
arraying
and
marshalling
them
.
<EOS>
Two
gentlemen
,
in
each
of
whom
I
recognised
an
acquaintance
,
officered
this
virgin
troop
.
<EOS>
One
,
an
artistic
-
looking
man
,
bearded
,
and
with
long
hair
,
was
a
noted
pianiste
,
and
also
the
first
music
-
teacher
in
Villette
;
he
attended
twice
a
week
at
Madame
Beck
's
pensionnat
,
to
give
lessons
to
the
few
pupils
whose
parents
were
rich
enough
to
allow
their
daughters
the
privilege
of
his
instructions
;
his
name
was
M.
Josef
Emanuel
,
and
he
was
half
-
brother
to
M.
Paul
:
which
potent
personage
was
now
visible
in
the
person
of
the
second
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
M.
Paul
amused
me
;
I
smiled
to
myself
as
I
watched
him
,
he
seemed
so
thoroughly
in
his
element
 
standing
conspicuous
in
presence
of
a
wide
and
grand
assemblage
,
arranging
,
restraining
,
over
-
aweing
about
one
hundred
young
ladies
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
too
,
so
perfectly
in
earnest
 
so
energetic
,
so
intent
,
and
,
above
all
,
so
absolute
:
<EOS>
and
yet
what
business
had
he
there
?
<EOS>
What
had
he
to
do
with
music
or
the
Conservatoirehe
who
could
hardly
distinguish
one
note
from
another
?
<EOS>
I
knew
that
it
was
his
love
of
display
and
authority
which
had
brought
him
there
 
a
love
not
offensive
,
only
because
so
naive
.
<EOS>
It
presently
became
obvious
that
his
brother
,
M.
Josef
,
was
as
much
under
his
control
as
were
the
girls
themselves
.
<EOS>
Never
was
such
a
little
hawk
of
a
man
as
that
M.
Paul
!
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
some
noted
singers
and
musicians
dawned
upon
the
platform
:
as
these
stars
rose
,
the
comet
-
like
professor
set
.
<EOS>
Insufferable
to
him
were
all
notorieties
and
celebrities
:
where
he
could
not
outshine
,
he
fled
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
all
was
prepared
:
but
one
compartment
of
the
hall
waited
to
be
filled
 
a
compartment
covered
with
crimson
,
like
the
grand
staircase
and
doors
,
furnished
with
stuffed
and
cushioned
benches
,
ranged
on
each
side
of
two
regal
chairs
,
placed
solemnly
under
a
canopy
.
  
<EOS>
A
signal
was
given
,
the
doors
rolled
back
,
the
assembly
stood
up
,
the
orchestra
burst
out
,
and
,
to
the
welcome
of
a
choral
burst
,
enter
the
King
,
the
Queen
,
the
Court
of
Labassecour
.
  
<EOS>
Till
then
,
I
had
never
set
eyes
on
living
king
or
queen
;
it
may
consequently
be
conjectured
how
I
strained
my
powers
of
vision
to
take
in
these
specimens
of
European
royalty
.
<EOS>
By
whomsoever
majesty
is
beheld
for
the
first
time
,
there
will
always
be
experienced
a
vague
surprise
bordering
on
disappointment
,
that
the
same
does
not
appear
seated
,
en
permanence
,
on
a
throne
,
bonneted
with
a
crown
,
and
furnished
,
as
to
the
hand
,
with
a
sceptre
.
<EOS>
Looking
out
for
a
king
and
queen
,
and
seeing
only
a
middle
-
aged
soldier
and
a
rather
young
lady
,
I
felt
half
cheated
,
half
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
Well
do
I
recall
that
King
 
<EOS>
a
man
of
fifty
,
a
little
bowed
,
a
little
grey
:
there
was
no
face
in
all
that
assembly
which
resembled
his
.
<EOS>
I
had
never
read
,
never
been
told
anything
of
his
nature
or
his
habits
;
and
at
first
the
strong
hieroglyphics
graven
as
with
iron
stylet
on
his
brow
,
round
his
eyes
,
beside
his
mouth
,
puzzled
and
baffled
instinct
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
however
,
if
I
did
not
know
,
at
least
I
felt
,
the
meaning
of
those
characters
written
without
hand
.
<EOS>
There
sat
a
silent
sufferer
 
a
nervous
,
melancholy
man
.
<EOS>
Those
eyes
had
looked
on
the
visits
of
a
certain
ghost
 
had
long
waited
the
comings
and
goings
of
that
strangest
spectre
,
Hypochondria
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
saw
her
now
on
that
stage
,
over
against
him
,
amidst
all
that
brilliant
throng
.
<EOS>
Hypochondria
has
that
wo
nt
,
to
rise
in
the
midst
of
thousands
 
dark
as
Doom
,
pale
as
Malady
,
and
well
-
nigh
strong
as
Death
.
<EOS>
Her
comrade
and
victim
thinks
to
be
happy
one
moment
 
"
Not
so
,
"
says
she
;
"
I
come
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
freezes
the
blood
in
his
heart
,
and
beclouds
the
light
in
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Some
might
say
it
was
the
foreign
crown
pressing
the
King
's
brows
which
bent
them
to
that
peculiar
and
painful
fold
;
some
might
quote
the
effects
of
early
bereavement
.
<EOS>
Something
there
might
be
of
both
these
;
but
these
are
embittered
by
that
darkest
foe
of
humanity
 
constitutional
melancholy
.
<EOS>
The
Queen
,
his
wife
,
knew
this
:
<EOS>
it
seemed
to
me
,
the
reflection
of
her
husband
's
grief
lay
,
a
subduing
shadow
,
on
her
own
benignant
face
.
<EOS>
A
mild
,
thoughtful
,
graceful
woman
that
princess
seemed
;
not
beautiful
,
not
at
all
like
the
women
of
solid
charms
and
marble
feelings
described
a
page
or
two
since
.
<EOS>
Hers
was
a
somewhat
slender
shape
;
her
features
,
though
distinguished
enough
,
were
too
suggestive
of
reigning
dynasties
and
royal
lines
to
give
unqualified
pleasure
.
<EOS>
The
expression
clothing
that
profile
was
agreeable
in
the
present
instance
;
but
you
could
not
avoid
connecting
it
with
remembered
effigies
,
where
similar
lines
appeared
,
under
phase
ignoble
;
feeble
,
or
sensual
,
or
cunning
,
as
the
case
might
be
.
<EOS>
The
Queen
's
eye
,
however
,
was
her
own
;
and
pity
,
goodness
,
sweet
sympathy
,
blessed
it
with
divinest
light
.
<EOS>
She
moved
no
sovereign
,
but
a
lady
 
kind
,
loving
,
elegant
.
<EOS>
Her
little
son
,
the
Prince
of
Labassecour
,
and
young
Duc
de
Dindonneau
,
accompanied
her
:
he
leaned
on
his
mother
's
knee
;
and
,
ever
and
anon
,
in
the
course
of
that
evening
,
I
saw
her
observant
of
the
monarch
at
her
side
,
conscious
of
his
beclouded
abstraction
,
and
desirous
to
rouse
him
from
it
by
drawing
his
attention
to
their
son
.
<EOS>
She
often
bent
her
head
to
listen
to
the
boy
's
remarks
,
and
would
then
smilingly
repeat
them
to
his
sire
.
<EOS>
The
moody
King
started
,
listened
,
smiled
,
but
invariably
relapsed
as
soon
as
his
good
angel
ceased
speaking
.
<EOS>
Full
mournful
and
significant
was
that
spectacle
!
<EOS>
Not
the
less
so
because
,
both
for
the
aristocracy
and
the
honest
bourgeoisie
of
Labassecour
,
its
peculiarity
seemed
to
be
wholly
invisible
:
I
could
not
discover
that
one
soul
present
was
either
struck
or
touched
.
  
<EOS>
With
the
King
and
Queen
had
entered
their
court
,
comprising
two
or
three
foreign
ambassadors
;
and
with
them
came
the
elite
of
the
foreigners
then
resident
in
Villette
.
<EOS>
These
took
possession
of
the
crimson
benches
;
the
ladies
were
seated
;
most
of
the
men
remained
standing
:
their
sable
rank
,
lining
the
background
,
looked
like
a
dark
foil
to
the
splendour
displayed
in
front
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
splendour
without
varying
light
and
shade
and
gradation
:
the
middle
distance
was
filled
with
matrons
in
velvets
and
satins
,
in
plumes
and
gems
;
the
benches
in
the
foreground
,
to
the
Queen
's
right
hand
,
seemed
devoted
exclusively
to
young
girls
,
the
flower
 
<EOS>
perhaps
,
I
should
rather
say
,
the
bud
 
of
Villette
aristocracy
.
<EOS>
Here
were
no
jewels
,
<EOS>
no
head
-
dresses
,
no
velvet
pile
or
silken
sheen
purity
,
simplicity
,
and
aërial
grace
reigned
in
that
virgin
band
.
<EOS>
Young
heads
simply
braided
,
and
fair
forms
<EOS>
(
I
was
going
to
write
_
sylph
_
forms
,
but
that
would
have
been
quite
untrue
:
several
of
these
"
jeunes
filles
,
"
who
had
not
numbered
more
than
sixteen
or
seventeen
years
,
boasted
contours
as
robust
and
solid
as
those
of
a
stout
Englishwoman
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
)
 
<EOS>
fair
forms
robed
in
white
,
or
pale
rose
,
or
placid
blue
,
suggested
thoughts
of
heaven
and
angels
.
<EOS>
I
knew
a
couple
,
at
least
,
of
these
"
rose
et
blanche
"
specimens
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
pair
of
Madame
Beck
's
late
pupils
 
Mesdemoiselles
Mathilde
and
Angélique
:
pupils
who
,
during
their
last
year
at
school
,
ought
to
have
been
in
the
first
class
,
but
whose
brains
never
got
them
beyond
the
second
division
.
<EOS>
In
English
,
they
had
been
under
my
own
charge
,
and
hard
work
<EOS>
it
was
to
get
them
to
translate
rationally
a
page
of
_
The
Vicar
of
Wakefield
_
.
<EOS>
Also
during
three
months
I
had
one
of
them
for
my
vis
-
<EOS>
à
-
vis
at
table
,
and
the
quantity
of
household
bread
,
butter
,
and
stewed
fruit
,
she
would
habitually
consume
at
"
second
déjeuner
"
<EOS>
was
a
real
world
's
wonder
 
to
be
exceeded
only
by
the
fact
of
her
actually
pocketing
slices
she
could
not
eat
.
<EOS>
Here
be
truths
 
wholesome
truths
,
too
.
  
<EOS>
I
knew
another
of
these
seraphs
 
the
prettiest
,
or
,
at
any
rate
,
the
least
demure
and
hypocritical
looking
of
the
lot
:
she
was
seated
by
the
daughter
of
an
English
peer
,
also
an
honest
,
though
haughty
-
looking
girl
:
both
had
entered
in
the
suite
of
the
British
embassy
.
<EOS>
She
(
_
i.e.
_
my
acquaintance
)
had
a
slight
,
pliant
figure
,
not
at
all
like
the
forms
of
the
foreign
damsels
:
<EOS>
her
hair
,
too
,
was
not
close
-
braided
,
like
a
shell
or
a
skull
-
cap
of
satin
;
it
looked
_
like
_
hair
,
and
waved
from
her
head
,
long
,
curled
,
and
flowing
.
<EOS>
She
chatted
away
volubly
,
and
seemed
full
of
a
light
-
headed
sort
of
satisfaction
with
herself
and
her
position
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
look
at
Dr.
Bretton
;
but
I
knew
that
he
,
too
,
saw
Ginevra
Fanshawe
<EOS>
:
he
had
become
so
quiet
,
he
answered
so
briefly
his
mother
's
remarks
,
he
so
often
suppressed
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
sigh
?
<EOS>
He
had
confessed
a
taste
for
the
pursuit
of
love
under
difficulties
;
here
was
full
gratification
for
that
taste
.
<EOS>
His
lady
-
love
beamed
upon
him
from
a
sphere
above
his
own
:
he
could
not
come
near
her
;
he
was
not
certain
that
he
could
win
from
her
a
look
.
<EOS>
I
watched
to
see
if
she
would
so
far
favour
him
.
<EOS>
Our
seat
was
not
far
from
the
crimson
benches
;
we
must
inevitably
be
seen
thence
,
by
eyes
<EOS>
so
quick
and
roving
as
Miss
Fanshawe
's
,
and
very
soon
those
optics
of
hers
were
upon
us
:
at
least
,
upon
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
I
kept
rather
in
the
shade
and
out
of
sight
,
not
wishing
to
be
immediately
recognised
:
she
looked
quite
steadily
at
Dr.
John
,
and
then
she
raised
a
glass
to
examine
his
mother
;
a
minute
or
two
afterwards
she
laughingly
whispered
her
neighbour
;
upon
the
performance
commencing
,
her
rambling
attention
was
attracted
to
the
platform
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
concert
I
need
not
dwell
;
the
reader
would
not
care
to
have
my
impressions
thereanent
:
and
,
indeed
,
it
would
not
be
worth
while
to
record
them
,
as
they
were
the
impressions
of
an
ignorance
crasse
.
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
of
the
Conservatoire
,
being
very
much
frightened
,
made
rather
a
tremulous
exhibition
on
the
two
grand
pianos
.
<EOS>
M.
Josef
Emanuel
stood
by
them
while
they
played
;
but
he
had
not
the
tact
or
influence
of
his
kinsman
,
who
,
under
similar
circumstances
,
would
certainly
have
_
compelled
_
pupils
of
his
to
demean
themselves
with
heroism
and
self
-
possession
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
would
have
placed
the
hysteric
débutantes
between
two
fires
 
terror
of
the
audience
,
and
terror
of
himself
 
and
would
have
inspired
them
with
the
courage
of
desperation
,
by
making
the
latter
terror
incomparably
the
greater
:
M.
Josef
could
not
do
this
.
  
<EOS>
Following
the
white
muslin
pianistes
,
came
a
fine
,
full
-
grown
,
sulky
lady
in
white
satin
.
<EOS>
She
sang
.
<EOS>
Her
singing
just
affected
me
like
the
tricks
of
a
conjuror
:
I
wondered
how
she
did
it
 
<EOS>
how
she
made
her
voice
run
up
and
down
,
and
cut
such
marvellous
capers
;
but
a
simple
Scotch
melody
,
played
by
a
rude
street
minstrel
,
has
often
moved
me
more
deeply
.
  
<EOS>
Afterwards
stepped
forth
a
gentleman
,
who
,
bending
his
body
a
good
deal
in
the
direction
of
the
King
and
Queen
,
and
frequently
approaching
his
white
-
gloved
hand
to
the
region
of
his
heart
,
vented
a
bitter
outcry
against
a
certain
"
fausse
Isabelle
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
he
seemed
especially
to
solicit
the
Queen
's
sympathy
;
but
,
unless
I
am
egregiously
mistaken
,
her
Majesty
lent
her
attention
rather
with
the
calm
of
courtesy
than
the
earnestness
of
interest
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
's
state
of
mind
was
very
harrowing
,
and
I
was
glad
when
he
wound
up
his
musical
exposition
of
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
Some
rousing
choruses
struck
me
as
the
best
part
of
the
evening
's
entertainment
.
<EOS>
There
were
present
deputies
from
all
the
best
provincial
choral
societies
;
genuine
,
barrel
-
shaped
,
native
Labassecouriens
.
<EOS>
These
worthies
gave
voice
without
mincing
the
matter
their
hearty
exertions
had
at
least
this
good
result
 
<EOS>
the
ear
drank
<EOS>
thence
a
satisfying
sense
of
power
.
  
<EOS>
Through
the
whole
performance
 
timid
instrumental
duets
,
conceited
vocal
solos
,
sonorous
,
brass
-
lunged
choruses
 
<EOS>
my
attention
gave
but
one
eye
and
one
ear
to
the
stage
,
the
other
being
permanently
retained
in
the
service
of
Dr.
Bretton
:
I
could
not
forget
him
,
nor
cease
to
question
how
he
was
feeling
,
what
he
was
thinking
,
whether
he
was
amused
or
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
do
you
like
it
all
,
Lucy
?
<EOS>
You
are
very
quiet
,
"
he
said
,
in
his
own
cheerful
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quiet
,
"
I
said
,
"
because
I
am
so
very
,
_
<EOS>
very
_
much
interested
:
not
merely
with
the
music
,
but
with
everything
about
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
proceeded
to
make
some
further
remarks
,
with
so
much
equanimity
and
composure
that
I
began
to
think
he
had
really
not
seen
what
I
had
seen
,
and
I
whispered
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Fanshawe
is
here
:
have
you
noticed
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
!
<EOS>
and
I
observed
that
you
noticed
her
too
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
come
with
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
is
there
with
a
very
grand
party
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
Ginevra
was
in
_
her
_
train
;
and
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
was
in
Lady
"
s
train
,
who
was
in
the
Queen
's
train
.
<EOS>
If
this
were
not
one
of
the
compact
little
minor
European
courts
,
whose
very
formalities
are
little
more
imposing
than
familiarities
,
and
whose
gala
grandeur
is
but
homeliness
in
Sunday
array
,
it
would
sound
all
very
fine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ginevra
saw
you
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
do
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
my
eye
on
her
several
times
since
you
withdrew
yours
;
and
I
have
had
the
honour
of
witnessing
a
little
spectacle
which
you
were
spared
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
ask
what
;
I
waited
voluntary
information
,
which
was
presently
given
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Fanshawe
,
"
he
said
,
"
has
a
companion
with
her
 
a
lady
of
rank
.
<EOS>
I
happen
to
know
Lady
Sara
by
sight
;
her
noble
mother
has
called
me
in
professionally
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
proud
girl
,
but
not
in
the
least
insolent
,
and
I
doubt
whether
Ginevra
will
have
gained
ground
in
her
estimation
by
making
a
butt
of
her
neighbours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
neighbours
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Merely
myself
and
my
mother
.
<EOS>
As
to
me
it
is
all
very
natural
:
nothing
,
I
suppose
,
can
be
fairer
game
than
the
young
bourgeois
doctor
;
but
my
mother
!
<EOS>
I
never
saw
her
ridiculed
before
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
the
curling
lip
,
and
sarcastically
levelled
glass
thus
directed
,
gave
me
a
most
curious
sensation
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Think
nothing
of
it
,
Dr.
John
:
it
is
not
worth
while
.
<EOS>
If
Ginevra
were
in
a
giddy
mood
,
as
she
is
eminently
to
-
night
,
she
would
make
no
scruple
of
laughing
at
that
mild
,
pensive
Queen
,
or
that
melancholy
King
.
<EOS>
She
is
not
actuated
by
malevolence
,
but
sheer
,
heedless
folly
.
<EOS>
To
a
feather
-
brained
school
-
girl
nothing
is
sacred
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
forget
:
I
have
not
been
accustomed
to
look
on
Miss
Fanshawe
in
the
light
of
a
feather
-
brained
school
-
girl
.
<EOS>
Was
she
not
my
divinity
 
the
angel
of
my
career
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
<EOS>
There
was
your
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
speak
the
honest
truth
,
without
any
false
rant
or
assumed
romance
,
there
actually
was
a
moment
,
six
months
ago
,
when
I
thought
her
divine
.
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
our
conversation
about
the
presents
?
<EOS>
I
was
not
quite
open
with
you
in
discussing
that
subject
:
<EOS>
the
warmth
with
which
you
took
it
up
amused
me
.
<EOS>
By
way
of
having
the
full
benefit
of
your
lights
,
I
allowed
you
to
think
me
more
in
the
dark
than
I
really
was
.
<EOS>
It
was
that
test
of
the
presents
which
first
proved
Ginevra
mortal
.
<EOS>
Still
her
beauty
retained
its
fascination
:
three
days
 
three
hours
ago
,
I
was
very
much
her
slave
.
<EOS>
As
she
passed
me
to
-
night
,
triumphant
in
beauty
,
my
emotions
did
her
homage
;
but
for
one
luckless
sneer
,
I
should
yet
be
the
humblest
of
her
servants
.
<EOS>
She
might
have
scoffed
at
_
me
_
,
and
,
while
wounding
,
she
would
not
soon
have
alienated
me
:
through
myself
,
she
could
not
in
ten
years
have
done
what
,
in
a
moment
,
she
has
done
through
my
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
held
his
peace
awhile
.
<EOS>
Never
before
had
I
seen
so
much
fire
,
and
so
little
sunshine
in
Dr.
John
's
blue
eye
as
just
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
"
he
recommenced
,
"
look
well
at
my
mother
,
and
say
,
without
fear
or
favour
,
in
what
light
she
now
appears
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
she
always
does
 
an
English
,
middle
-
class
gentlewoman
;
well
,
though
gravely
dressed
,
habitually
independent
of
pretence
,
constitutionally
composed
and
cheerful
.
"
  
"
So
she
seems
to
me
 
bless
her
!
<EOS>
The
merry
may
laugh
_
with
_
mamma
,
but
the
weak
only
will
laugh
_
at
_
her
.
<EOS>
She
shall
not
be
ridiculed
,
with
my
consent
,
at
least
;
nor
without
my
 
my
scorn
 
<EOS>
my
antipathy
 
<EOS>
my
 
<EOS>
"
  
He
stopped
:
and
it
was
time
 
<EOS>
for
he
was
getting
excited
 
more
<EOS>
it
seemed
than
the
occasion
warranted
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
then
know
that
he
had
witnessed
double
cause
for
dissatisfaction
with
Miss
Fanshawe
.
<EOS>
The
glow
of
his
complexion
,
the
expansion
of
his
nostril
,
the
bold
curve
which
disdain
gave
his
well
-
cut
under
lip
,
showed
him
in
a
new
and
striking
phase
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
rare
passion
of
the
constitutionally
suave
and
serene
,
is
not
a
pleasant
spectacle
;
nor
did
I
like
the
sort
of
vindictive
thrill
which
passed
through
his
strong
young
frame
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
frighten
you
,
Lucy
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
why
you
are
so
very
angry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
this
reason
,
"
he
muttered
in
my
ear
.
<EOS>
"
Ginevra
is
neither
a
pure
angel
,
nor
a
pure
-
minded
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
you
exaggerate
:
<EOS>
she
has
no
great
harm
in
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Too
much
for
me
.
<EOS>
_
I
_
can
see
where
_
you
_
are
blind
.
<EOS>
Now
dismiss
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Let
me
amuse
myself
by
teasing
mamma
:
I
will
assert
that
she
is
flagging
.
<EOS>
Mamma
,
pray
rouse
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
John
,
I
will
certainly
rouse
you
if
you
are
not
better
conducted
.
<EOS>
Will
you
and
Lucy
be
silent
,
that
I
may
hear
the
singing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
then
thundering
in
a
chorus
,
under
cover
of
which
all
the
previous
dialogue
had
taken
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
You
_
hear
the
singing
,
mamma
!
<EOS>
Now
,
I
will
wager
my
studs
,
which
are
genuine
,
against
your
paste
brooch
 
"
  
"
My
paste
brooch
,
Graham
?
<EOS>
Profane
boy
!
<EOS>
you
know
that
it
is
a
stone
of
value
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
is
one
of
your
superstitions
:
you
were
cheated
in
the
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
cheated
in
fewer
things
than
you
imagine
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
happen
to
be
acquainted
with
young
ladies
of
the
court
,
John
?
<EOS>
I
have
observed
two
of
them
pay
you
no
small
attention
during
the
last
half
-
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
not
observe
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
Because
one
of
them
satirically
levels
her
eyeglass
at
me
?
<EOS>
She
is
a
pretty
,
silly
girl
:
but
are
you
apprehensive
that
her
titter
will
discomfit
the
old
lady
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
sensible
,
admirable
old
lady
!
<EOS>
Mother
,
you
are
better
to
me
than
ten
wives
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
be
demonstrative
,
John
,
or
I
shall
faint
,
and
you
will
have
to
carry
me
out
;
and
if
that
burden
were
laid
upon
you
,
you
would
reverse
your
last
speech
,
and
exclaim
,
"
Mother
,
ten
wives
could
hardly
be
worse
to
me
than
you
are
!

<EOS>

<EOS>
The
concert
over
,
the
Lottery
"
au
bénéfice
des
pauvres
"
came
next
:
the
interval
between
was
one
of
general
relaxation
,
and
the
pleasantest
imaginable
stir
and
commotion
.
<EOS>
The
white
flock
was
cleared
from
the
platform
;
a
busy
throng
of
gentlemen
crowded
it
instead
,
making
arrangements
for
the
drawing
;
and
amongst
these
 
the
busiest
of
all
 
re
-
appeared
that
certain
well
-
known
form
,
not
tall
but
active
,
alive
with
the
energy
and
movement
of
three
tall
men
.
<EOS>
How
M.
Paul
did
work
!
<EOS>
How
he
issued
directions
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
set
his
own
shoulder
to
the
wheel
!
<EOS>
Half
-
a
-
dozen
assistants
were
at
his
beck
to
remove
the
pianos
,
&
c.
;
no
matter
,
he
must
add
to
their
strength
his
own
.
<EOS>
The
redundancy
of
his
alertness
was
half
-
vexing
,
half
-
ludicrous
:
in
my
mind
I
both
disapproved
and
derided
most
of
this
fuss
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
in
the
midst
of
prejudice
and
annoyance
,
I
could
not
,
while
watching
,
avoid
perceiving
a
certain
not
disagreeable
naïveté
in
all
he
did
and
said
;
nor
could
I
be
blind
to
certain
vigorous
characteristics
of
his
physiognomy
,
rendered
conspicuous
now
by
the
contrast
with
a
throng
of
tamer
faces
:
the
deep
,
intent
keenness
of
his
eye
,
the
power
of
his
forehead
,
pale
,
broad
,
and
full
 
the
mobility
of
his
most
flexible
mouth
.
<EOS>
He
lacked
the
calm
of
force
,
but
its
movement
and
its
fire
he
signally
possessed
.
  
<EOS>
Meantime
the
whole
hall
was
in
a
stir
;
most
people
rose
and
remained
standing
,
for
a
change
;
some
walked
about
,
all
talked
and
laughed
.
<EOS>
The
crimson
compartment
presented
a
peculiarly
animated
scene
.
<EOS>
The
long
cloud
of
gentlemen
,
breaking
into
fragments
,
mixed
with
the
rainbow
line
of
ladies
;
two
or
three
officer
-
like
men
approached
the
King
and
conversed
with
him
.
<EOS>
The
Queen
,
leaving
her
chair
,
glided
along
the
rank
of
young
ladies
,
who
all
stood
up
as
she
passed
;
and
to
each
in
turn
I
saw
her
vouchsafe
some
token
of
kindness
 
<EOS>
a
gracious
word
,
look
or
smile
.
<EOS>
To
the
two
pretty
English
girls
,
Lady
Sara
and
Ginevra
Fanshawe
,
she
addressed
several
sentences
;
as
she
left
them
,
both
,
and
especially
the
latter
,
seemed
to
glow
all
over
with
gratification
.
<EOS>
They
were
afterwards
accosted
by
several
ladies
,
and
a
little
circle
of
gentlemen
gathered
round
them
;
amongst
these
 
the
nearest
to
Ginevra
 
stood
the
Count
de
Hamal
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
room
is
stiflingly
hot
,
"
said
Dr.
Bretton
,
rising
with
sudden
impatience
.
"
<EOS>
Lucy
 
mother
 
<EOS>
will
you
come
a
moment
to
the
fresh
air
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
with
him
,
Lucy
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
keep
my
seat
.
"
  
<EOS>
Willingly
would
I
have
kept
mine
also
,
but
Graham
's
desire
must
take
precedence
of
my
own
;
I
accompanied
him
.
  
<EOS>
We
found
the
night
-
air
keen
;
or
at
least
I
did
:
he
did
not
seem
to
feel
it
;
but
it
was
very
still
,
and
the
star
-
sown
sky
spread
cloudless
.
<EOS>
I
was
wrapped
in
a
fur
shawl
.
<EOS>
We
took
some
turns
on
the
pavement
;
in
passing
under
a
lamp
,
Graham
encountered
my
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
look
pensive
,
Lucy
:
is
it
on
my
account
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
only
fearing
that
you
were
grieved
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
at
all
:
so
be
of
good
cheer
 
as
I
am
.
<EOS>
Whenever
I
die
,
Lucy
,
my
persuasion
is
that
it
will
not
be
of
heart
-
complaint
.
<EOS>
I
may
be
stung
,
I
may
seem
to
droop
for
a
time
,
but
no
pain
or
malady
of
sentiment
has
yet
gone
through
my
whole
system
.
<EOS>
You
have
always
seen
me
cheerful
at
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Generally
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
she
laughed
at
my
mother
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
give
the
old
lady
for
a
dozen
beauties
.
<EOS>
That
sneer
did
me
all
the
good
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
Miss
Fanshawe
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
lifted
his
hat
from
his
waved
locks
,
and
made
a
mock
reverence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
thank
her
.
<EOS>
She
has
made
me
feel
that
nine
parts
in
ten
of
my
heart
have
always
been
sound
as
a
bell
,
and
the
tenth
bled
from
a
mere
puncture
:
a
lancet
-
prick
that
will
heal
in
a
trice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
angry
just
now
,
heated
and
indignant
;
you
will
think
and
feel
differently
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
_
I
_
heated
and
indignant
!
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
me
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
the
heat
is
gone
:
I
am
as
cool
as
the
night
 
which
,
by
the
way
,
may
be
too
cool
for
you
.
<EOS>
We
will
go
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dr.
John
,
this
is
a
sudden
change
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
it
:
<EOS>
or
if
it
be
,
there
are
good
reasons
for
it
 
<EOS>
two
good
reasons
<EOS>
:
I
have
told
you
one
.
<EOS>
But
now
let
us
re
-
enter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
did
not
easily
regain
our
seats
;
the
lottery
was
begun
,
and
all
was
excited
confusion
;
crowds
blocked
the
sort
of
corridor
along
which
we
had
to
pass
:
<EOS>
it
was
necessary
to
pause
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
Happening
to
glance
round
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
half
fancied
<EOS>
I
heard
my
name
pronounced
 
<EOS>
I
saw
quite
near
,
the
ubiquitous
,
the
inevitable
M.
Paul
.
<EOS>
He
was
looking
at
me
gravely
and
intently
:
at
me
,
or
rather
at
my
pink
dress
 
sardonic
comment
on
which
gleamed
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
Now
it
was
his
habit
to
indulge
in
strictures
on
the
dress
,
both
of
the
teachers
and
pupils
,
at
Madame
Beck
's
 
a
habit
which
the
former
,
at
least
,
held
to
be
an
offensive
impertinence
:
as
yet
I
had
not
suffered
from
it
 
my
sombre
daily
attire
not
being
calculated
to
attract
notice
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
no
mood
to
permit
any
new
encroachment
to
-
night
:
rather
than
accept
his
banter
,
I
would
ignore
his
presence
,
and
accordingly
steadily
turned
my
face
to
the
sleeve
of
Dr.
John
's
coat
;
finding
in
that
same
black
sleeve
a
prospect
more
redolent
of
pleasure
and
comfort
,
more
genial
,
more
friendly
,
I
thought
,
than
was
offered
by
the
dark
little
Professor
's
unlovely
visage
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
seemed
unconsciously
to
sanction
the
preference
by
looking
down
and
saying
in
his
kind
voice
,
"
Ay
,
keep
close
to
my
side
,
Lucy
:
these
crowding
burghers
are
no
respecters
of
persons
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
could
not
,
however
,
be
true
to
myself
.
<EOS>
Yielding
to
some
influence
,
mesmeric
or
otherwise
 
an
influence
unwelcome
,
displeasing
,
but
effective
 
<EOS>
I
again
glanced
round
to
see
if
M.
Paul
was
gone
.
<EOS>
No
,
there
he
stood
on
the
same
spot
,
looking
still
,
but
with
a
changed
eye
;
he
had
penetrated
my
thought
,
and
read
my
wish
to
shun
him
.
<EOS>
The
mocking
but
not
ill
-
humoured
<EOS>
gaze
was
turned
to
a
swarthy
frown
,
and
when
I
bowed
,
with
a
view
to
conciliation
,
I
got
only
the
stiffest
and
sternest
of
nods
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whom
have
you
made
angry
,
Lucy
?
"
whispered
Dr.
Bretton
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
is
that
savage
-
looking
friend
of
yours
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
of
the
professors
at
Madame
Beck
's
:
a
very
cross
little
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
looks
mighty
cross
just
now
:
what
have
you
done
to
him
?
<EOS>
What
is
it
all
about
?
<EOS>
Ah
,
Lucy
,
Lucy
!
<EOS>
tell
me
the
meaning
of
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
mystery
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
is
very
exigeant
,
and
because
I
looked
at
your
coat
-
sleeve
,
instead
of
curtseying
and
dipping
to
him
,
he
thinks
I
have
failed
in
respect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
little
 
"
began
Dr.
John
:
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
more
he
would
have
added
,
for
at
that
moment
I
was
nearly
thrown
down
amongst
the
feet
of
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
had
rudely
pushed
past
,
and
was
elbowing
his
way
with
such
utter
disregard
to
the
convenience
and
security
of
all
around
,
that
a
very
uncomfortable
pressure
was
the
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
is
what
he
himself
would
call
"
méchant
,
"
"
said
Dr.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
I
thought
so
,
too
.
  
<EOS>
Slowly
and
with
difficulty
we
made
our
way
along
the
passage
,
and
at
last
regained
our
seats
.
<EOS>
The
drawing
of
the
lottery
lasted
nearly
an
hour
;
it
was
an
animating
and
amusing
scene
;
and
as
we
each
held
tickets
,
we
shared
in
the
alternations
of
hope
and
fear
raised
by
each
turn
of
the
wheel
.
<EOS>
Two
little
girls
,
of
five
and
six
years
old
,
drew
the
numbers
:
and
the
prizes
were
duly
proclaimed
from
the
platform
.
<EOS>
These
prizes
were
numerous
,
though
of
small
value
.
<EOS>
It
so
fell
out
that
Dr.
John
and
I
each
gained
one
:
mine
was
a
cigar
-
case
,
his
a
lady
's
head
-
dress
 
a
most
airy
sort
of
blue
and
silver
turban
,
with
a
streamer
of
plumage
on
one
side
,
like
a
snowy
cloud
.
<EOS>
He
was
excessively
anxious
to
make
an
exchange
;
but
I
could
not
be
brought
to
hear
reason
,
and
to
this
day
I
keep
my
cigar
-
case
:
it
serves
,
when
I
look
at
it
,
to
remind
me
of
old
times
,
and
one
happy
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
John
,
for
his
part
,
held
his
turban
at
arm
's
length
between
his
finger
and
thumb
,
and
looked
at
it
with
a
mixture
of
reverence
and
embarrassment
highly
provocative
of
laughter
.
<EOS>
The
contemplation
over
,
he
was
about
coolly
to
deposit
the
delicate
fabric
on
the
ground
between
his
feet
;
he
seemed
to
have
no
shadow
of
an
idea
of
the
treatment
or
stowage
it
ought
to
receive
:
if
his
mother
had
not
come
to
the
rescue
,
I
think
he
would
finally
have
crushed
it
under
his
arm
like
an
opera
-
hat
;
she
restored
it
to
the
band
-
box
whence
it
had
issued
.
  
<EOS>
Graham
was
quite
cheerful
all
the
evening
,
and
his
cheerfulness
seemed
natural
and
unforced
.
<EOS>
His
demeanour
,
his
look
,
is
not
easily
described
;
there
was
something
in
it
peculiar
,
and
,
in
its
way
,
original
.
<EOS>
I
read
in
it
no
common
mastery
of
the
passions
,
and
a
fund
of
deep
and
healthy
strength
which
,
without
any
exhausting
effort
,
bore
down
Disappointment
and
extracted
her
fang
.
<EOS>
His
manner
,
now
,
reminded
me
of
qualities
I
had
noticed
in
him
when
professionally
engaged
amongst
the
poor
,
the
guilty
,
and
the
suffering
,
in
the
Basse
-
Ville
:
he
looked
at
once
determined
,
enduring
,
and
sweet
-
tempered
.
<EOS>
Who
could
help
liking
him
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
betrayed
no
weakness
which
harassed
all
your
feelings
with
considerations
as
to
how
its
faltering
must
be
propped
;
from
_
him
_
broke
no
irritability
which
startled
calm
and
quenched
mirth
;
<EOS>
_
his
_
lips
let
fall
no
caustic
that
burned
to
the
bone
;
_
his
_
eye
shot
no
morose
shafts
that
went
cold
,
and
rusty
,
and
venomed
through
your
heart
:
beside
him
was
rest
and
refuge
 
around
him
,
fostering
sunshine
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
he
had
neither
forgiven
nor
forgotten
Miss
Fanshawe
.
<EOS>
Once
angered
,
I
doubt
if
Dr.
Bretton
were
to
be
soon
propitiated
 
once
alienated
,
whether
he
were
ever
to
be
reclaimed
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
more
than
once
;
not
stealthily
or
humbly
,
but
with
a
movement
of
hardy
,
open
observation
.
<EOS>
De
Hamal
was
now
a
fixture
beside
her
;
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
sat
near
,
and
they
and
she
were
wholly
absorbed
in
the
discourse
,
mirth
,
and
excitement
,
with
which
the
crimson
seats
were
as
much
astir
as
any
plebeian
part
of
the
hall
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
some
apparently
animated
discussion
,
Ginevra
once
or
twice
lifted
her
hand
and
arm
;
a
handsome
bracelet
gleamed
upon
the
latter
.
<EOS>
I
saw
that
its
gleam
flickered
in
Dr.
John
's
eye
 
quickening
therein
a
derisive
,
ireful
sparkle
;
he
laughed
:
    
"
I
think
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
will
lay
my
turban
on
my
wonted
altar
of
offerings
;
there
,
at
any
rate
,
it
would
be
certain
to
find
favour
:
<EOS>
no
grisette
has
a
more
facile
faculty
of
acceptance
.
<EOS>
Strange
!
<EOS>
for
after
all
,
I
know
she
is
a
girl
of
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
n't
know
her
education
,
Dr.
John
,
"
said
I.
<EOS>
"
Tossed
about
all
her
life
from
one
foreign
school
to
another
,
she
may
justly
proffer
the
plea
of
ignorance
in
extenuation
of
most
of
her
faults
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
from
what
she
says
,
I
believe
her
father
and
mother
were
brought
up
much
as
she
has
been
brought
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
understood
she
had
no
fortune
;
and
once
I
had
pleasure
in
the
thought
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
tells
me
,
"
I
answered
,
"
that
they
are
poor
at
home
;
she
always
speaks
quite
candidly
on
such
points
:
you
never
find
her
lying
,
as
these
foreigners
will
often
lie
.
<EOS>
Her
parents
have
a
large
family
:
they
occupy
such
a
station
and
possess
such
connections
as
,
in
their
opinion
,
demand
display
;
stringent
necessity
of
circumstances
and
inherent
thoughtlessness
of
disposition
combined
,
have
engendered
reckless
unscrupulousness
as
to
how
they
obtain
the
means
of
sustaining
a
good
appearance
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
state
of
things
,
and
the
only
state
of
things
,
she
has
seen
from
childhood
upwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
 
<EOS>
and
I
thought
to
mould
her
to
something
better
:
<EOS>
but
,
Lucy
,
to
speak
the
plain
truth
,
I
have
felt
a
new
thing
to
-
night
,
in
looking
at
her
and
de
Hamal
.
<EOS>
I
felt
it
before
noticing
the
impertinence
directed
at
my
mother
.
<EOS>
I
saw
a
look
interchanged
between
them
immediately
after
their
entrance
,
which
threw
a
most
unwelcome
light
on
my
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
You
have
been
long
aware
of
the
flirtation
they
keep
up
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
flirtation
!
<EOS>
That
might
be
an
innocent
girlish
wile
to
lure
on
the
true
lover
;
but
what
I
refer
to
was
not
flirtation
:
it
was
a
look
marking
mutual
and
secret
understanding
 
it
was
neither
girlish
nor
innocent
.
<EOS>
No
woman
,
were
she
as
beautiful
as
Aphrodite
,
who
could
give
or
receive
such
a
glance
,
shall
ever
be
sought
in
marriage
by
me
:
<EOS>
I
would
rather
we
d
a
paysanne
in
a
short
petticoat
and
high
cap
 
and
be
sure
that
she
was
honest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
smiling
.
<EOS>
I
felt
sure
he
now
exaggerated
the
case
:
<EOS>
Ginevra
,
I
was
certain
,
was
honest
enough
,
with
all
her
giddiness
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
so
.
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
,
and
said
he
would
not
be
the
man
to
trust
her
with
his
honour
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
only
thing
,
"
said
I
,
"
with
which
you
may
safely
trust
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
unscrupulously
damage
a
husband
's
purse
and
property
,
recklessly
try
his
patience
and
temper
<EOS>
:
I
do
n't
think
she
would
breathe
,
or
let
another
breathe
,
on
his
honour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
becoming
her
advocate
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
wish
me
to
resume
my
old
chains
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
:
I
am
glad
to
see
you
free
,
and
trust
that
free
you
will
long
remain
.
<EOS>
Yet
be
,
at
the
same
time
,
just
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
:
just
as
Rhadamanthus
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
When
once
I
am
thoroughly
estranged
,
I
can
not
help
being
severe
.
<EOS>
But
look
!
<EOS>
the
King
and
Queen
are
rising
.
<EOS>
I
like
that
Queen
<EOS>
:
she
has
a
sweet
countenance
.
<EOS>
Mamma
,
too
,
is
excessively
tired
;
we
shall
never
get
the
old
lady
home
if
we
stay
longer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tired
,
John
?
"
cried
Mrs.
Bretton
,
looking
at
least
as
animated
and
as
wide
-
awake
as
her
son
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
undertake
to
sit
you
out
yet
:
leave
us
both
here
till
morning
,
and
we
should
see
which
would
look
the
most
jaded
by
sunrise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
like
to
try
the
experiment
;
for
,
in
truth
,
mamma
,
you
are
the
most
unfading
of
evergreens
and
the
freshest
of
matrons
.
<EOS>
It
must
then
be
on
the
plea
of
your
son
's
delicate
nerves
and
fragile
constitution
that
I
found
a
petition
for
our
speedy
adjournment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indolent
young
man
!
<EOS>
You
wish
you
were
in
bed
,
no
doubt
;
and
I
suppose
you
must
be
humoured
.
<EOS>
There
is
Lucy
,
too
,
looking
quite
done
up
.
<EOS>
For
shame
,
Lucy
!
<EOS>
At
your
age
,
a
week
of
evenings
-
out
would
not
have
made
me
a
shade
paler
.
<EOS>
Come
away
,
both
of
you
;
and
you
may
laugh
at
the
old
lady
as
much
as
you
please
,
but
,
for
my
part
,
I
shall
take
charge
of
the
bandbox
and
turban
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Which
she
did
accordingly
.
<EOS>
I
offered
to
relieve
her
,
but
was
shaken
off
with
kindly
contempt
:
my
godmother
opined
that
I
had
enough
to
do
to
take
care
of
myself
.
<EOS>
Not
standing
on
ceremony
now
,
in
the
midst
of
the
gay
"
confusion
worse
confounded
"
succeeding
to
the
King
and
Queen
's
departure
,
Mrs.
Bretton
preceded
us
,
and
promptly
made
us
a
lane
through
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
Graham
followed
,
apostrophizing
his
mother
as
the
most
flourishing
grisette
it
had
ever
been
his
good
fortune
to
see
charged
with
carriage
of
a
bandbox
;
he
also
desired
me
to
mark
her
affection
for
the
sky
-
blue
turban
,
and
announced
his
conviction
that
she
intended
one
day
to
wear
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
night
was
now
very
cold
and
very
dark
,
but
with
little
delay
we
found
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
Soon
we
were
packed
in
it
,
as
warm
and
as
snug
as
at
a
fire
-
side
;
and
the
drive
home
was
,
I
think
,
still
pleasanter
than
the
drive
to
the
concert
.
<EOS>
Pleasant
it
was
,
even
though
the
coachman
 
having
spent
in
the
shop
of
a
"
marchand
de
vin
"
a
portion
of
the
time
we
passed
at
the
concert
 
drove
us
along
the
dark
and
solitary
chaussée
far
past
the
turn
leading
down
to
La
Terrasse
;
we
,
who
were
occupied
in
talking
and
laughing
,
not
noticing
the
aberration
till
,
at
last
,
Mrs.
Bretton
intimated
that
,
though
she
had
always
thought
the
château
a
retired
spot
<EOS>
,
she
did
not
know
it
was
situated
at
the
world
's
end
,
as
she
declared
seemed
now
to
be
the
case
,
for
she
believed
we
had
been
an
hour
and
a
half
en
route
,
and
had
not
yet
taken
the
turn
down
the
avenue
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Graham
looked
out
,
and
perceiving
only
dim
-
spread
fields
,
with
unfamiliar
rows
of
pollards
and
limes
ranged
along
their
else
invisible
sunk
-
fences
,
began
to
conjecture
how
matters
were
,
and
calling
a
halt
and
descending
,
he
mounted
the
box
and
took
the
reins
himself
.
<EOS>
Thanks
to
him
,
we
arrived
safe
at
home
about
an
hour
and
a
half
beyond
our
time
.
  
<EOS>
Martha
had
not
forgotten
us
;
a
cheerful
fire
was
burning
,
and
a
neat
supper
spread
in
the
dining
-
room
:
<EOS>
we
were
glad
of
both
.
<EOS>
The
winter
dawn
was
actually
breaking
before
we
gained
our
chambers
.
<EOS>
I
took
off
my
pink
dress
and
lace
mantle
with
happier
feelings
than
I
had
experienced
in
putting
them
on
.
<EOS>
Not
all
,
perhaps
,
who
had
shone
brightly
arrayed
at
that
concert
could
say
the
same
;
for
not
all
had
been
satisfied
with
friendship
 
with
its
calm
comfort
and
modest
hope
.
    
<EOS>
REACTION
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
three
days
,
and
then
I
must
go
back
to
the
_
pensionnat
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
I
almost
numbered
the
moments
of
these
days
upon
the
clock
;
fain
would
I
have
retarded
their
flight
;
but
they
glided
by
while
I
watched
them
:
they
were
already
gone
while
I
yet
feared
their
departure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
will
not
leave
us
to
-
day
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bretton
,
coaxingly
at
breakfast
;
"
she
knows
we
can
procure
a
second
respite
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
ask
for
one
if
I
might
have
it
for
a
word
,
"
said
I.
<EOS>
"
I
long
to
get
the
good
-
by
over
,
and
to
be
settled
in
the
Rue
Fossette
again
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
this
morning
:
I
must
go
directly
;
my
trunk
is
packed
and
corded
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
appeared
;
however
,
that
my
going
depended
upon
Graham
;
he
had
said
he
would
accompany
,
me
,
and
it
so
fell
out
that
he
was
engaged
all
day
,
and
only
returned
home
at
dusk
.
<EOS>
Then
ensued
a
little
combat
of
words
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
and
her
son
pressed
me
to
remain
one
night
more
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
cried
,
so
irritated
and
eager
was
I
to
be
gone
.
<EOS>
I
longed
to
leave
them
as
the
criminal
on
the
scaffold
longs
for
the
axe
to
descend
:
that
is
,
I
wished
the
pang
over
.
<EOS>
How
much
I
wished
it
,
they
could
not
tell
.
<EOS>
On
these
points
,
mine
was
a
state
of
mind
out
of
their
experience
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
dark
when
Dr.
John
handed
me
from
the
carriage
at
Madame
Beck
's
door
.
<EOS>
The
lamp
above
was
lit
;
it
rained
a
November
drizzle
,
as
it
had
rained
all
day
:
the
lamplight
gleamed
on
the
wet
pavement
.
<EOS>
Just
such
a
night
was
it
as
that
on
which
,
not
a
year
ago
,
I
had
first
stopped
at
this
very
threshold
;
just
similar
was
the
scene
.
<EOS>
I
remembered
the
very
shapes
of
the
paving
-
stones
which
I
had
noted
with
idle
eye
,
while
,
with
a
thick
-
beating
heart
,
I
waited
the
unclosing
of
that
door
at
which
I
stood
 
a
solitary
and
a
suppliant
.
<EOS>
On
that
night
,
too
,
I
had
briefly
met
him
who
now
stood
with
me
.
<EOS>
Had
I
ever
reminded
him
of
that
rencontre
,
or
explained
it
?
<EOS>
I
had
not
,
nor
ever
felt
the
inclination
to
do
so
<EOS>
:
it
was
a
pleasant
thought
,
laid
by
in
my
own
mind
,
and
best
kept
there
.
  
<EOS>
Graham
rung
the
bell
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
instantly
opened
,
for
it
was
just
that
period
of
the
evening
when
the
half
-
boarders
took
their
departure
 
<EOS>
consequently
,
Rosine
was
on
the
alert
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
come
in
,
"
said
I
to
him
;
but
he
stepped
a
moment
into
the
well
-
lighted
vestibule
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
wished
him
to
see
that
"
the
water
stood
in
my
eyes
,
"
for
his
<EOS>
was
too
kind
a
nature
ever
to
be
needlessly
shown
such
signs
of
sorrow
.
<EOS>
He
always
wished
to
heal
 
to
relieve
 
when
,
physician
as
he
was
,
neither
cure
nor
alleviation
were
,
perhaps
,
in
his
power
.
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
up
your
courage
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Think
of
my
mother
and
myself
as
true
friends
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
forget
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
will
I
forget
you
,
Dr.
John
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
trunk
was
now
brought
in
.
<EOS>
We
had
shaken
hands
;
he
had
turned
to
go
,
but
he
was
not
satisfied
:
he
had
not
done
or
said
enough
to
content
his
generous
impulses
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
"
 
stepping
after
me
 
"
shall
you
feel
very
solitary
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
first
I
shall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
mother
will
soon
call
to
see
you
;
and
,
meantime
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
'll
do
.
<EOS>
I
'll
write
 
just
any
cheerful
nonsense
that
comes
into
my
head
 
<EOS>
shall
I
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
,
gallant
heart
!
<EOS>
"
thought
I
to
myself
;
but
I
shook
my
head
,
smiling
,
and
said
,
"
Never
think
of
it
:
impose
on
yourself
no
such
task
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
write
to
_
me
<EOS>
_
!
 
<EOS>
you
'll
not
have
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
will
find
or
make
time
.
<EOS>
Good
-
by
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
gone
.
<EOS>
The
heavy
door
crashed
to
:
the
axe
had
fallen
 
<EOS>
the
pang
was
experienced
.
  
<EOS>
Allowing
myself
no
time
to
think
or
feel
 
swallowing
tears
as
if
they
had
been
wine
 
<EOS>
I
passed
to
Madame
's
sitting
-
room
to
pay
the
necessary
visit
of
ceremony
and
respect
.
<EOS>
She
received
me
with
perfectly
well
-
acted
cordiality
 
was
even
demonstrative
,
though
brief
,
in
her
welcome
.
<EOS>
In
ten
minutes
I
was
dismissed
.
<EOS>
From
the
salle
-
à
-
manger
I
proceeded
to
the
refectory
,
where
pupils
and
teachers
were
now
assembled
for
evening
study
:
again
I
had
a
welcome
,
and
one
not
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
quite
hollow
.
<EOS>
That
over
,
I
was
free
to
repair
to
the
dormitory
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
will
Graham
really
write
?
<EOS>
"
I
questioned
,
as
I
sank
tired
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Reason
,
coming
stealthily
up
to
me
through
the
twilight
of
that
long
,
dim
chamber
,
whispered
sedately
 
"
He
may
write
once
.
<EOS>
So
kind
is
his
nature
,
it
may
stimulate
him
for
once
to
make
the
effort
.
<EOS>
But
it
_
can
not
_
be
continued
 
it
_
<EOS>
may
_
not
be
repeated
.
<EOS>
Great
were
that
folly
which
should
build
on
such
a
promise
 
insane
that
credulity
which
should
mistake
the
transitory
rain
-
pool
,
holding
in
its
hollow
one
draught
,
for
the
perennial
spring
yielding
the
supply
of
seasons
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
bent
my
head
:
I
sat
thinking
an
hour
longer
.
<EOS>
Reason
still
whispered
me
,
laying
on
my
shoulder
a
withered
hand
,
and
frostily
touching
my
ear
with
the
chill
blue
lips
of
eld
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
,
"
muttered
she
,
"
<EOS>
if
he
_
should
_
write
,
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
Do
you
meditate
pleasure
in
replying
?
<EOS>
Ah
,
fool
!
<EOS>
I
warn
you
!
<EOS>
Brief
be
your
answer
.
<EOS>
Hope
no
delight
of
heart
 
<EOS>
no
indulgence
of
intellect
<EOS>
:
grant
no
expansion
to
feeling
 
give
holiday
to
no
single
faculty
:
<EOS>
dally
with
no
friendly
exchange
:
foster
no
genial
intercommunion
....
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
I
have
talked
to
Graham
and
you
did
not
chide
,
"
I
pleaded
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
needed
not
.
<EOS>
Talk
for
you
is
good
discipline
.
<EOS>
You
converse
imperfectly
.
<EOS>
While
you
speak
,
there
can
be
no
oblivion
of
inferiority
 
no
encouragement
to
delusion
:
pain
,
privation
<EOS>
,
penury
stamp
your
language
....
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
,
"
I
again
broke
in
,
"
where
the
bodily
presence
is
weak
and
the
speech
contemptible
,
surely
there
can
not
be
error
in
making
written
language
<EOS>
the
medium
of
better
utterance
than
faltering
lips
can
achieve
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Reason
only
answered
,
"
At
your
peril
you
cherish
that
idea
,
or
suffer
its
influence
to
animate
any
writing
of
yours
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
I
feel
,
may
I
_
never
_
express
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Never
!
<EOS>
_
"
declared
Reason
.
  
<EOS>
I
groaned
under
her
bitter
sternness
.
<EOS>
Never
 
never
 
oh
,
hard
word
!
<EOS>
This
hag
,
this
Reason
,
would
not
let
me
look
up
,
or
smile
,
or
hope
:
<EOS>
she
could
not
rest
unless
I
were
altogether
crushed
,
cowed
,
broken
-
in
,
and
broken
-
down
.
<EOS>
According
to
her
,
I
was
born
only
to
work
for
a
piece
of
bread
,
to
await
the
pains
of
death
,
and
steadily
through
all
life
to
despond
.
<EOS>
Reason
might
be
right
;
yet
no
wonder
we
are
glad
at
times
to
defy
her
,
to
rush
from
under
her
rod
and
give
a
truant
hour
to
Imagination
 
_
<EOS>
her
_
soft
,
bright
foe
,
_
<EOS>
our
_
sweet
Help
,
our
divine
Hope
.
<EOS>
We
shall
and
must
break
bounds
at
intervals
,
despite
the
terrible
revenge
that
awaits
our
return
.
<EOS>
Reason
is
vindictive
as
a
devil
:
for
me
she
was
always
envenomed
as
a
step
-
mother
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
obeyed
her
it
has
chiefly
been
with
the
obedience
of
fear
,
not
of
love
.
<EOS>
Long
ago
I
should
have
died
of
her
ill
-
usage
her
stint
,
her
chill
,
her
barren
board
,
her
icy
bed
,
her
savage
,
ceaseless
blows
;
but
for
that
kinder
Power
who
holds
my
secret
and
sworn
allegiance
.
<EOS>
Often
has
Reason
turned
me
out
by
night
,
in
mid
-
winter
,
on
cold
snow
,
flinging
for
sustenance
the
gnawed
bone
dogs
had
forsaken
:
sternly
has
she
vowed
her
stores
held
nothing
more
for
me
 
harshly
denied
my
right
to
ask
better
things
....
<EOS>
Then
,
looking
up
,
have
I
seen
in
the
sky
a
head
amidst
circling
stars
,
of
which
the
midmost
and
the
brightest
lent
a
ray
sympathetic
and
attent
.
<EOS>
A
spirit
,
softer
and
better
than
Human
Reason
,
has
descended
with
quiet
flight
to
the
waste
 
bringing
all
round
her
a
sphere
of
air
borrowed
of
eternal
summer
;
bringing
perfume
of
flowers
which
can
not
fade
 
fragrance
of
trees
whose
fruit
is
life
;
bringing
breezes
pure
from
a
world
whose
day
needs
no
sun
to
lighten
it
.
<EOS>
My
hunger
has
this
good
angel
appeased
with
food
,
sweet
and
strange
,
gathered
amongst
gleaning
angels
,
garnering
their
dew
-
white
harvest
in
the
first
fresh
hour
of
a
heavenly
day
;
tenderly
has
she
assuaged
the
insufferable
fears
which
weep
away
life
itself
 
kindly
given
rest
to
deadly
weariness
 
generously
lent
hope
and
impulse
to
paralyzed
despair
.
<EOS>
Divine
,
compassionate
,
succourable
influence
!
<EOS>
When
I
bend
the
knee
to
other
than
God
,
it
shall
be
at
thy
white
and
winged
feet
,
beautiful
on
mountain
or
on
plain
.
<EOS>
Temples
have
been
reared
to
the
Sun
 
altars
dedicated
to
the
Moon
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
greater
glory
!
<EOS>
To
thee
neither
hands
build
,
nor
lips
consecrate
:
but
<EOS>
hearts
,
through
ages
,
are
faithful
to
thy
worship
.
<EOS>
A
dwelling
thou
hast
,
too
wide
for
walls
,
too
high
for
dome
 
<EOS>
a
temple
whose
floors
are
space
 
<EOS>
rites
whose
mysteries
transpire
in
presence
,
to
the
kindling
,
the
harmony
of
worlds
!
  
<EOS>
Sovereign
complete
!
<EOS>
thou
hadst
,
for
endurance
,
thy
great
army
of
martyrs
;
for
achievement
,
thy
chosen
band
of
worthies
.
<EOS>
Deity
unquestioned
,
thine
essence
foils
decay
!
  
<EOS>
This
daughter
of
Heaven
remembered
me
to
-
night
;
she
saw
me
weep
,
and
she
came
with
comfort
:
<EOS>
"
Sleep
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Sleep
,
sweetly
 
I
gild
thy
dreams
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
kept
her
word
,
and
watched
me
through
a
night
's
rest
;
but
at
dawn
Reason
relieved
the
guard
.
<EOS>
I
awoke
with
a
sort
of
start
;
the
rain
was
dashing
against
the
panes
,
and
the
wind
uttering
a
peevish
cry
at
intervals
;
the
night
-
lamp
was
dying
on
the
black
circular
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
dormitory
<EOS>
:
day
had
already
broken
.
<EOS>
How
I
pity
those
whom
mental
pain
stuns
instead
of
rousing
!
<EOS>
This
morning
the
pang
of
waking
snatched
me
out
of
bed
like
a
hand
with
a
giant
's
gripe
.
<EOS>
How
quickly
I
dressed
in
the
cold
of
the
raw
dawn
!
<EOS>
How
deeply
I
drank
of
the
ice
-
cold
water
in
my
carafe
!
<EOS>
This
was
always
my
cordial
,
to
which
,
like
other
dram
-
drinkers
,
I
had
eager
recourse
when
unsettled
by
chagrin
.
  
<EOS>
Ere
long
the
bell
rang
its
_
réveillée
_
to
the
whole
school
.
<EOS>
Being
dressed
,
I
descended
alone
to
the
refectory
,
where
the
stove
was
lit
and
the
air
was
warm
;
through
the
rest
of
the
house
it
was
cold
,
with
the
nipping
severity
of
a
continental
winter
:
though
now
<EOS>
but
the
beginning
of
November
,
a
north
wind
had
thus
early
brought
a
wintry
blight
over
Europe
<EOS>
:
I
remember
the
black
stoves
pleased
me
little
when
I
first
came
;
but
now
I
began
to
associate
with
them
a
sense
of
comfort
,
and
liked
them
,
as
in
England
we
like
a
fireside
.
  
<EOS>
Sitting
down
before
this
dark
comforter
,
I
presently
fell
into
a
deep
argument
with
myself
on
life
and
its
chances
,
on
destiny
and
her
decrees
.
<EOS>
My
mind
,
calmer
and
stronger
now
than
last
night
,
made
for
itself
some
imperious
rules
,
prohibiting
under
deadly
penalties
all
weak
retrospect
of
happiness
past
;
commanding
a
patient
journeying
through
the
wilderness
of
the
present
,
enjoining
a
reliance
on
faith
 
a
watching
of
the
cloud
and
pillar
which
subdue
while
they
guide
,
and
awe
while
they
illumine
 
hushing
the
impulse
to
fond
idolatry
,
checking
the
longing
out
-
look
for
a
far
-
off
promised
land
whose
rivers
are
,
perhaps
,
never
to
be
,
reached
save
in
dying
dreams
,
whose
sweet
pastures
are
to
be
viewed
but
from
the
desolate
and
sepulchral
summit
of
a
Nebo
.
  
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
a
composite
feeling
of
blended
strength
and
pain
wound
itself
wirily
round
my
heart
,
sustained
,
or
at
least
restrained
,
its
throbbings
,
and
made
me
fit
for
the
day
's
work
.
<EOS>
I
lifted
my
head
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
said
before
,
I
was
sitting
near
the
stove
,
let
into
the
wall
beneath
the
refectory
and
the
carré
,
and
thus
sufficing
to
heat
both
apartments
.
<EOS>
Piercing
the
same
wall
,
and
close
beside
the
stove
,
was
a
window
,
looking
also
into
the
carré
;
as
I
looked
up
a
cap
-
tassel
,
a
brow
,
two
eyes
,
filled
a
pane
of
that
window
;
the
fixed
gaze
of
those
two
eyes
hit
right
against
my
own
glance
:
they
were
watching
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
till
that
moment
known
that
tears
were
on
my
cheek
,
but
I
felt
them
now
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
strange
house
,
where
no
corner
was
sacred
from
intrusion
,
where
not
a
tear
could
be
shed
,
nor
a
thought
pondered
,
but
a
spy
was
at
hand
to
note
and
to
divine
.
<EOS>
And
this
new
,
this
out
-
door
,
this
male
spy
,
what
business
had
brought
him
to
the
premises
at
this
unwonted
hour
?
<EOS>
What
possible
right
had
he
to
intrude
on
me
thus
?
<EOS>
No
other
professor
would
have
dared
to
cross
the
carré
before
the
class
-
bell
rang
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
took
no
account
of
hours
nor
of
claims
:
there
was
some
book
of
reference
in
the
first
-
class
library
which
he
had
occasion
to
consult
;
he
had
come
to
seek
it
:
on
his
way
he
passed
the
refectory
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
much
his
habit
to
wear
eyes
before
,
behind
,
and
<EOS>
on
each
side
of
him
:
he
had
seen
me
through
the
little
window
 
he
now
opened
the
refectory
door
,
and
there
he
stood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
,
vous
êtes
triste
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
j'en
ai
bien
le
droit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Vous
êtes
malade
de
coeur
et
d'humeur
,
"
he
pursued
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
at
once
mournful
and
mutinous
.
<EOS>
I
see
on
your
cheek
two
tears
which
I
know
are
hot
as
two
sparks
,
and
salt
as
two
crystals
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
While
I
speak
you
eye
me
strangely
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you
of
what
I
am
reminded
while
watching
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
I
shall
be
called
away
to
prayers
shortly
;
my
time
for
conversation
is
very
scant
and
brief
at
this
hour
 
excuse
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
excuse
everything
,
"
he
interrupted
;
"
my
mood
is
<EOS>
so
meek
,
neither
rebuff
nor
,
perhaps
,
insult
could
ruffle
it
.
<EOS>
You
remind
me
,
then
,
of
a
young
she
wild
creature
,
new
caught
,
untamed
,
viewing
with
a
mixture
of
fire
and
fear
the
first
entrance
of
the
breaker
-
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
Unwarrantable
accost
!
 
<EOS>
rash
and
rude
if
addressed
to
a
pupil
;
to
a
teacher
inadmissible
.
<EOS>
He
thought
to
provoke
a
warm
reply
;
I
had
seen
him
vex
the
passionate
to
explosion
before
now
.
<EOS>
In
me
his
malice
should
find
no
gratification
;
I
sat
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
look
,
"
said
he
,
"
like
one
who
would
snatch
at
a
draught
of
sweet
poison
,
and
spurn
wholesome
bitters
with
disgust
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
I
never
liked
bitters
;
nor
do
I
believe
them
wholesome
.
<EOS>
And
to
whatever
is
sweet
,
be
it
poison
or
food
,
you
can
not
,
at
least
,
deny
its
own
delicious
quality
 
sweetness
.
<EOS>
Better
,
perhaps
,
to
die
quickly
a
pleasant
death
,
than
drag
on
long
a
charmless
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
,
"
said
he
,
"
you
should
take
your
bitter
dose
duly
and
daily
,
if
I
had
the
power
to
administer
it
;
and
,
as
to
the
well
-
beloved
poison
,
I
would
,
perhaps
,
break
the
very
cup
which
held
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
sharply
turned
my
head
away
,
partly
because
his
presence
utterly
displeased
me
,
and
partly
because
I
wished
to
shun
questions
:
lest
,
in
my
present
mood
,
the
effort
of
answering
should
overmaster
self
-
command
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
said
he
,
more
softly
,
"
tell
me
the
truth
 
<EOS>
you
grieve
at
being
parted
from
friends
 
<EOS>
is
it
not
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
insinuating
softness
was
not
more
acceptable
than
the
inquisitorial
curiosity
.
<EOS>
I
was
silent
.
<EOS>
He
came
into
the
room
,
sat
down
on
the
bench
about
two
yards
from
me
,
and
persevered
long
,
and
,
for
him
,
patiently
,
in
attempts
to
draw
me
into
conversation
 
<EOS>
attempts
necessarily
unavailing
,
because
I
_
could
_
not
talk
.
<EOS>
At
last
I
entreated
to
be
let
alone
.
<EOS>
In
uttering
the
request
,
my
voice
faltered
,
my
head
sank
on
my
arms
and
the
table
.
<EOS>
I
wept
bitterly
,
though
quietly
.
<EOS>
He
sat
a
while
longer
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
look
up
nor
speak
,
<EOS>
till
the
closing
door
and
his
retreating
step
told
me
that
he
was
gone
.
<EOS>
These
tears
proved
a
relief
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
time
to
bathe
my
eyes
before
breakfast
,
and
I
suppose
I
appeared
at
that
meal
as
serene
as
any
other
person
:
not
,
however
,
quite
as
jocund
-
looking
as
the
young
lady
who
placed
herself
in
the
seat
opposite
mine
,
fixed
on
me
a
pair
of
somewhat
small
eyes
twinkling
gleefully
,
and
frankly
stretched
across
the
table
a
white
hand
to
be
shaken
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fanshawe
's
travels
,
gaieties
,
and
flirtations
agreed
with
her
mightily
;
she
had
become
quite
plump
,
her
cheeks
looked
as
round
as
apples
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
her
last
in
elegant
evening
attire
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
she
looked
less
charming
now
in
her
school
-
dress
,
a
kind
of
careless
peignoir
of
a
dark
-
blue
material
,
dimly
and
dingily
plaided
with
black
.
<EOS>
I
even
think
this
dusky
wrapper
gave
her
charms
a
triumph
;
enhancing
by
contrast
the
fairness
of
her
skin
,
the
freshness
of
her
bloom
,
the
golden
beauty
of
her
tresses
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
are
come
back
,
Timon
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
Timon
was
one
of
her
dozen
names
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
how
often
I
have
wanted
you
in
this
dismal
hole
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
have
you
?
<EOS>
Then
,
of
course
,
if
you
wanted
me
,
you
have
something
for
me
to
do
:
stockings
to
mend
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
gave
Ginevra
a
minute
's
or
a
farthing
's
credit
for
disinterestedness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Crabbed
and
crusty
as
ever
!
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
expected
as
much
:
it
would
not
be
you
if
you
did
not
snub
one
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
come
,
grand
-
mother
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
like
coffee
as
much
,
and
pistolets
as
little
as
ever
:
are
you
disposed
to
barter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
your
own
way
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
way
consisted
in
a
habit
she
had
of
making
me
convenient
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
like
the
morning
cup
of
coffee
;
its
school
brewage
not
being
strong
or
sweet
enough
to
suit
her
palate
;
and
she
had
an
excellent
appetite
,
like
any
other
healthy
school
-
girl
,
for
the
morning
pistolets
or
rolls
,
which
were
new
-
baked
and
very
good
,
and
of
which
a
certain
allowance
was
served
to
each
.
<EOS>
This
allowance
being
more
than
I
needed
,
I
gave
half
to
Ginevra
;
never
varying
in
my
preference
,
though
many
others
used
to
covet
the
superfluity
;
and
she
in
return
would
sometimes
give
me
a
portion
of
her
coffee
.
<EOS>
This
morning
I
was
glad
of
the
draught
;
hunger
I
had
none
,
and
with
thirst
I
was
parched
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
I
chose
to
give
my
bread
rather
to
Ginevra
than
to
another
;
nor
why
,
if
two
had
to
share
the
convenience
of
one
drinking
-
vessel
,
as
sometimes
happened
 
for
instance
,
when
we
took
a
long
walk
into
the
country
,
and
halted
for
refreshment
at
a
farm
 
I
always
contrived
that
she
should
be
my
convive
,
and
rather
liked
to
let
her
take
the
lion
's
share
,
whether
of
the
white
beer
,
the
sweet
wine
,
or
the
new
milk
:
<EOS>
so
it
was
,
however
,
and
she
knew
it
;
and
,
therefore
,
while
we
wrangled
daily
,
we
were
never
alienated
.
  
<EOS>
After
breakfast
my
custom
was
to
withdraw
to
the
first
classe
,
and
sit
and
read
,
or
think
(
oftenest
the
latter
)
there
alone
,
till
the
nine
-
o'clock
bell
threw
open
all
doors
,
admitted
the
gathered
rush
of
externes
and
demi
-
pensionnaires
,
and
gave
the
signal
for
entrance
on
that
bustle
and
business
to
which
,
till
five
P.M.
,
there
was
no
relax
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
just
seated
this
morning
,
when
a
tap
came
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
,
Mademoiselle
,
"
said
a
pensionnaire
,
<EOS>
entering
gently
;
and
having
taken
from
her
desk
some
necessary
book
or
paper
,
she
withdrew
on
tip
-
toe
,
murmuring
as
she
passed
me
,
"
<EOS>
Que
mademoiselle
est
appliquée
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Appliquée
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
The
means
of
application
were
spread
before
me
,
but
I
was
doing
nothing
;
and
had
done
nothing
,
and
meant
to
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
Thus
does
the
world
give
us
credit
for
merits
we
have
not
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
herself
deemed
me
a
regular
bas
-
bleu
,
and
often
and
solemnly
used
to
warn
me
not
to
study
too
much
,
lest
"
the
blood
should
all
go
to
my
head
.
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
everybody
in
the
Rue
Fossette
held
a
superstition
that
"
Meess
Lucie
"
was
learned
;
with
the
notable
exception
of
M.
Emanuel
,
who
,
by
means
peculiar
to
himself
,
and
quite
inscrutable
to
me
,
had
obtained
a
not
inaccurate
inkling
of
my
real
qualifications
,
and
used
to
take
quiet
opportunities
of
chuckling
in
my
ear
his
malign
glee
over
their
scant
measure
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
never
troubled
myself
about
this
penury
.
<EOS>
I
dearly
like
to
think
my
own
thoughts
;
I
had
great
pleasure
in
reading
a
few
books
,
but
not
many
:
preferring
always
those
on
whose
style
or
sentiment
the
writer
's
individual
nature
was
plainly
stamped
;
flagging
inevitably
over
characterless
books
,
however
clever
and
meritorious
:
perceiving
well
that
,
as
far
as
my
own
mind
was
concerned
,
God
had
limited
its
powers
and
,
its
action
 
<EOS>
thankful
,
I
trust
,
for
the
gift
bestowed
,
but
unambitious
of
higher
endowments
,
not
restlessly
eager
after
higher
culture
.
  
<EOS>
The
polite
pupil
was
scarcely
gone
,
when
,
unceremoniously
,
without
tap
,
in
burst
a
second
intruder
.
<EOS>
Had
I
been
blind
<EOS>
I
should
have
known
who
this
was
.
<EOS>
A
constitutional
reserve
of
manner
had
by
this
time
told
with
wholesome
and
,
for
me
,
commodious
effect
,
on
the
manners
of
my
co
-
inmates
;
rarely
did
I
now
suffer
from
rude
or
intrusive
treatment
.
<EOS>
When
I
first
came
,
it
would
happen
once
and
again
that
a
blunt
German
would
clap
me
on
the
shoulder
,
and
ask
me
to
run
a
race
;
or
a
riotous
Labassecourienne
seize
me
by
the
arm
and
drag
me
towards
the
playground
:
urgent
proposals
to
take
a
swing
at
the
"
Pas
de
Géant
,
"
or
to
join
in
a
certain
romping
hide
-
and
-
seek
game
called
"
Un
,
deux
,
trois
,
"
were
formerly
also
of
hourly
occurrence
;
but
all
these
little
attentions
had
ceased
some
time
ago
 
ceased
,
too
,
without
my
finding
it
necessary
to
be
at
the
trouble
of
point
-
blank
cutting
them
short
.
<EOS>
I
had
now
no
familiar
demonstration
to
dread
or
endure
,
save
from
one
quarter
;
and
as
that
was
English
<EOS>
I
could
bear
it
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
Fanshawe
made
no
scruple
of
 
at
times
 
catching
me
as
I
was
crossing
the
carré
,
whirling
me
round
in
a
compulsory
waltz
,
and
heartily
enjoying
the
mental
and
physical
discomfiture
her
proceeding
induced
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
Fanshawe
it
was
who
now
broke
in
upon
"
my
learned
leisure
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
carried
a
huge
music
-
book
under
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
to
your
practising
,
"
said
I
to
her
at
once
:
"
away
with
you
to
the
little
salon
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
till
I
have
had
a
talk
with
you
,
chère
amie
.
<EOS>
I
know
where
you
have
been
spending
your
vacation
,
and
how
you
have
commenced
sacrificing
to
the
graces
,
and
enjoying
life
like
any
other
belle
.
<EOS>
I
saw
you
at
the
concert
the
other
night
,
dressed
,
actually
,
like
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
Who
is
your
tailleuse
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tittle
-
tattle
:
how
prettily
it
begins
!
<EOS>
My
tailleuse
!
 
<EOS>
a
fiddlestick
!
<EOS>
Come
,
sheer
off
,
Ginevra
.
<EOS>
I
really
do
n't
want
your
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
when
I
want
yours
so
much
,
ange
farouche
,
what
does
a
little
reluctance
on
your
part
signify
?
<EOS>
Dieu
merci
!
<EOS>
we
know
how
to
manoeuvre
with
our
gifted
compatriote
 
<EOS>
the
learned
'
ourse
Britannique
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
Ourson
,
you
know
Isidore
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
John
Bretton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
hush
!
"
<EOS>
(
putting
her
fingers
in
her
ears
)
"
you
crack
my
tympanums
with
your
rude
Anglicisms
.
<EOS>
But
,
how
is
our
well
-
beloved
John
?
<EOS>
Do
tell
me
about
him
.
<EOS>
The
poor
man
must
be
in
a
sad
way
.
<EOS>
What
did
he
say
to
my
behaviour
the
other
night
?
<EOS>
Was
n't
I
cruel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
I
noticed
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
delightful
evening
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
divine
de
Hamal
!
<EOS>
And
then
to
watch
the
other
sulking
and
dying
in
the
distance
;
and
the
old
lady
 
my
future
mamma
-
in
-
law
!
<EOS>
But
I
am
afraid
I
and
Lady
Sara
were
a
little
rude
in
quizzing
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Sara
never
quizzed
her
at
all
;
and
for
what
_
you
_
did
,
do
n't
make
yourself
in
the
least
uneasy
:
Mrs.
Bretton
will
survive
_
your
_
sneer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
may
:
old
ladies
are
tough
;
but
that
poor
son
of
hers
!
<EOS>
Do
tell
me
what
he
said
:
<EOS>
I
saw
he
was
terribly
cut
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
said
you
looked
as
if
at
heart
you
were
already
Madame
de
Hamal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
he
?
"
<EOS>
she
cried
with
delight
.
"
<EOS>
He
noticed
that
?
<EOS>
How
charming
!
<EOS>
I
thought
he
would
be
mad
with
jealousy
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ginevra
,
have
you
seriously
done
with
Dr.
Bretton
?
<EOS>
Do
you
want
him
to
give
you
up
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
you
know
he
_
ca
n't
_
do
that
:
but
was
n't
he
mad
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
mad
,
"
I
assented
;
"
as
mad
as
a
March
hare
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
how
_
<EOS>
ever
_
did
you
get
him
home
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
How
_
ever
_
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Have
you
no
pity
on
his
poor
mother
and
me
?
<EOS>
Fancy
us
holding
him
tight
down
in
the
carriage
,
and
he
raving
between
us
,
fit
to
drive
everybody
delirious
.
<EOS>
The
very
coachman
went
wrong

somehow
,
and
we
lost
our
way

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
say
so
?
<EOS>
You
are
laughing
at
me

<EOS>
Now
,
Lucy
Snowe
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
assure
you
it
is
fact
 
and
fact
,
also
,
that
Dr.
Bretton
would
_
not
_
stay
in
the
carriage
:
he
broke
from
us

would
_
ride
outside

"
  
"
<EOS>
And
afterwards
?
"
  
"
Afterwards
 
when
he
_
did
_
reach
home
 
<EOS>
the
scene
transcends
description
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh

describe
it

it
is
such
fun

<EOS>

Fun
for
_
you

,
Miss
Fanshawe

"
(
with
stern
gravity

"
you
know
the
proverb
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
sport

death

"
  
"
Go

Conscientiously

In

conceive
Dr.

rejecting

the
chicken
,
the
sweetbread
prepared
for
his
refreshment
,
left
on
the
table
untouched
.
<EOS>
Then
 
but
it
is
of
no
use
dwelling
at
length
on
the
harrowing
details
.
<EOS>
Suffice
it
to
say
,
that
never
,
in
the
most
stormy
fits
and
moments
of
his
infancy
,
had
his
mother
such
work
to
tuck
the
sheets
about
him
as
she
had
that
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
n't
lie
still
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
n't
lie
still
:
there
it
was
.
<EOS>
The
sheets
might
be
tucked
in
,
but
the
thing
was
to
keep
them
tucked
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Say
!
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
imagine
him
demanding
his
divine
Ginevra
,
anathematizing
that
demon
,
<EOS>
de
Hamal
 
raving
about
golden
locks
,
blue
eyes
,
white
arms
,
glittering
bracelets
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
did
he
?
<EOS>
He
saw
the
bracelet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Saw
the
bracelet
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
as
plain
as
I
saw
it
:
and
,
perhaps
,
for
the
first
time
,
he
saw
also
the
brand
-
mark
with
which
its
pressure
has
encircled
your
arm
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
"
(
rising
,
and
changing
my
tone
)
,
"
come
,
we
will
have
an
end
of
this
.
<EOS>
Go
away
to
your
practising
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
I
opened
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
not
told
me
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
not
wait
until
I
_
do
_
tell
you
all
.
<EOS>
Such
extra
communicativeness
could
give
you
no
pleasure
.
<EOS>
March
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
Cross
thing
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
;
but
she
obeyed
:
and
,
indeed
,
the
first
classe
was
my
territory
,
and
she
could
not
there
legally
resist
a
notice
of
quittance
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
,
to
speak
the
truth
,
never
had
I
been
less
dissatisfied
with
her
than
I
was
then
.
<EOS>
There
was
pleasure
in
thinking
of
the
contrast
between
the
reality
and
my
description
 
to
remember
Dr.
John
enjoying
the
drive
home
,
eating
his
supper
with
relish
,
and
retiring
to
rest
with
Christian
composure
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
when
I
saw
him
really
unhappy
that
I
felt
really
vexed
with
the
fair
,
frail
cause
of
his
suffering
.
     
<EOS>
A
fortnight
passed
;
I
was
getting
once
more
inured
to
the
harness
of
school
,
and
lapsing
from
the
passionate
pain
of
change
to
the
palsy
of
custom
.
<EOS>
One
afternoon
,
in
crossing
the
carré
,
on
my
way
to
the
first
classe
,
where
I
was
expected
to
assist
at
a
lesson
of
"
style
and
literature
,
"
I
saw
,
standing
by
one
of
the
long
and
large
windows
,
Rosine
,
the
portress
.
<EOS>
Her
attitude
,
as
usual
,
was
quite
nonchalante
.
<EOS>
She
always
"
stood
at
ease
;
"
one
of
her
hands
rested
in
her
apron
-
pocket
,
the
other
at
this
moment
held
to
her
eyes
a
letter
,
whereof
Mademoiselle
coolly
perused
the
address
,
and
deliberately
studied
the
seal
.
  
<EOS>
A
letter
!
<EOS>
The
shape
of
a
letter
similar
to
that
had
haunted
my
brain
in
its
very
core
for
seven
days
past
.
<EOS>
I
had
dreamed
of
a
letter
last
night
.
<EOS>
Strong
magnetism
drew
me
to
that
letter
now
;
yet
,
whether
I
should
have
ventured
to
demand
of
Rosine
so
much
as
a
glance
at
that
white
envelope
,
with
the
spot
of
red
wax
in
the
middle
,
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
;
I
think
I
should
have
sneaked
past
in
terror
of
a
rebuff
from
Disappointment
:
my
heart
throbbed
now
as
if
I
already
heard
the
tramp
of
her
approach
.
<EOS>
Nervous
mistake
!
<EOS>
It
was
the
rapid
step
of
the
Professor
of
Literature
measuring
the
corridor
.
<EOS>
I
fled
before
him
.
<EOS>
Could
I
but
be
seated
quietly
at
my
desk
before
his
arrival
,
with
the
class
under
my
orders
all
in
disciplined
readiness
,
he
would
,
perhaps
,
exempt
me
from
notice
;
but
,
if
caught
lingering
in
the
carré
,
I
should
be
sure
to
come
in
for
a
special
harangue
.
<EOS>
I
had
time
to
get
seated
,
to
enforce
perfect
silence
,
to
take
out
my
work
,
and
to
commence
it
amidst
the
profoundest
and
best
trained
hush
,
ere
M.
Emanuel
entered
with
his
vehement
burst
of
latch
and
panel
,
and
his
deep
,
redundant
bow
,
prophetic
of
choler
.
  
<EOS>
As
usual
he
broke
upon
us
like
a
clap
of
thunder
;
but
instead
of
flashing
lightning
-
wise
from
the
door
to
the
estrade
,
his
career
halted
midway
at
my
desk
.
<EOS>
Setting
his
face
towards
me
and
the
window
,
his
back
to
the
pupils
and
the
room
,
he
gave
me
a
look
 
<EOS>
such
a
look
as
might
have
licensed
me
to
stand
straight
up
and
demand
what
he
meant
 
a
look
of
scowling
distrust
.
  
<EOS>
"
Voilà
!
<EOS>
pour
vous
,
"
said
he
,
drawing
his
hand
from
his
waist
-
coat
,
and
placing
on
my
desk
a
letter
 
<EOS>
the
very
letter
I
had
seen
in
Rosine
's
hand
 
<EOS>
the
letter
whose
face
of
enamelled
white
and
single
Cyclop's
-
eye
of
vermilion
-
red
had
printed
themselves
so
clear
and
perfect
on
the
retina
of
an
inward
vision
.
<EOS>
I
knew
it
,
I
felt
it
to
be
the
letter
of
my
hope
,
the
fruition
of
my
wish
,
the
release
from
my
doubt
,
the
ransom
from
my
terror
.
<EOS>
This
letter
M.
Paul
,
with
his
unwarrantably
interfering
habits
,
had
taken
from
the
portress
,
and
now
delivered
it
himself
.
  
<EOS>
I
might
have
been
angry
,
but
had
not
a
second
for
the
sensation
.
<EOS>
Yes
:
I
held
in
my
hand
not
a
slight
note
,
but
an
envelope
,
which
must
,
at
least
,
contain
a
sheet
:
<EOS>
it
felt
not
flimsy
,
but
firm
,
substantial
,
satisfying
.
<EOS>
And
here
was
the
direction
,
"
Miss
Lucy
Snowe
,
"
in
a
clean
,
clear
,
equal
,
decided
hand
;
and
here
was
the
seal
,
round
,
full
,
deftly
dropped
by
untremulous
fingers
,
stamped
with
the
well
-
cut
impress
of
initials
,
"
J.
G.
B.
"
I
experienced
a
happy
feeling
 
a
glad
emotion
which
went
warm
to
my
heart
,
and
ran
lively
through
all
my
veins
.
<EOS>
For
once
a
hope
was
realized
.
<EOS>
I
held
in
my
hand
a
morsel
of
real
solid
joy
:
not
a
dream
,
not
an
image
of
the
brain
,
not
one
of
those
shadowy
chances
imagination
pictures
,
and
on
which
humanity
starves
but
can
not
live
;
not
a
mess
of
that
manna
I
drearily
eulogized
awhile
ago
 
<EOS>
which
,
indeed
,
at
first
melts
on
the
lips
with
an
unspeakable
and
preternatural
sweetness
,
but
which
,
in
the
end
,
our
souls
full
surely
loathe
;
longing
deliriously
for
natural
and
earth
-
grown
food
,
wildly
praying
Heaven
's
Spirits
to
reclaim
their
own
spirit
-
dew
and
essence
 
an
aliment
divine
,
but
for
mortals
deadly
.
<EOS>
It
was
neither
sweet
hail
nor
small
coriander
-
seed
 
neither
slight
wafer
,
nor
luscious
honey
,
I
had
lighted
on
;
it
was
the
wild
,
savoury
mess
of
the
hunter
,
nourishing
and
salubrious
meat
,
<EOS>
forest
-
fed
or
desert
-
reared
,
fresh
,
healthful
,
and
life
-
sustaining
.
<EOS>
It
was
what
the
old
dying
patriarch
demanded
of
his
son
Esau
,
promising
in
requital
the
blessing
of
his
last
breath
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
godsend
;
and
I
inwardly
thanked
the
God
who
had
vouchsafed
it
.
<EOS>
Outwardly
I
only
thanked
man
,
crying
,
"
Thank
you
,
thank
you
,
Monsieur
!
"
  
<EOS>
Monsieur
curled
his
lip
,
gave
me
a
vicious
glance
of
the
eye
,
and
strode
to
his
estrade
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
was
not
at
all
a
good
little
man
,
though
he
had
good
points
.
  
<EOS>
Did
I
read
my
letter
there
and
then
?
<EOS>
Did
I
consume
the
venison
at
once
and
with
haste
,
as
if
Esau
's
shaft
flew
every
day
?
  
<EOS>
I
knew
better
.
<EOS>
The
cover
with
its
address
 
the
seal
,
with
its
three
clear
letters
 
was
bounty
and
abundance
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
I
stole
from
the
room
,
I
procured
the
key
of
the
great
dormitory
,
which
was
kept
locked
by
day
.
<EOS>
I
went
to
my
bureau
;
with
a
sort
of
haste
and
trembling
lest
Madame
should
creep
up
-
stairs
and
spy
me
,
I
opened
a
drawer
,
unlocked
a
box
,
and
took
out
a
case
,
and
 
having
feasted
my
eyes
with
one
more
look
,
and
approached
the
seal
with
a
mixture
of
awe
and
shame
and
delight
,
to
my
lips
 
I
folded
the
untasted
treasure
,
yet
all
fair
and
inviolate
,
in
silver
paper
,
committed
it
to
the
case
,
shut
up
box
and
drawer
,
reclosed
,
relocked
the
dormitory
,
and
returned
to
class
,
feeling
as
if
fairy
tales
were
true
,
and
fairy
gifts
no
dream
.
<EOS>
Strange
,
sweet
insanity
!
<EOS>
And
this
letter
,
the
source
of
my
joy
,
I
had
not
yet
read
:
did
not
yet
know
the
number
of
its
lines
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
re
-
entered
the
schoolroom
,
behold
M.
Paul
raging
like
a
pestilence
!
<EOS>
Some
pupil
had
not
spoken
audibly
or
distinctly
enough
to
suit
his
ear
and
taste
,
and
now
she
and
others
were
weeping
,
and
he
was
raving
from
his
estrade
,
almost
livid
.
<EOS>
Curious
to
mention
,
as
I
appeared
,
he
fell
on
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
I
the
mistress
of
these
girls
?
<EOS>
Did
I
profess
to
teach
them
the
conduct
befitting
ladies
?
 
<EOS>
and
did
I
permit
<EOS>
and
,
he
doubted
not
,
encourage
them
to
strangle
their
mother
-
tongue
in
their
throats
,
to
mince
and
mash
it
between
their
teeth
,
as
if
they
had
some
base
cause
to
be
ashamed
of
the
words
they
uttered
?
<EOS>
Was
this
modesty
?
<EOS>
He
knew
better
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
vile
pseudo
sentiment
 
<EOS>
the
offspring
or
the
forerunner
of
evil
.
<EOS>
Rather
than
submit
to
this
mopping
and
mowing
,
this
mincing
and
grimacing
,
this
,
grinding
of
a
noble
tongue
,
this
general
affectation
and
sickening
stubbornness
of
the
pupils
of
the
first
class
,
he
would
throw
them
up
for
a
set
of
insupportable
petites
maîtresses
,
and
confine
himself
to
teaching
the
ABC
to
the
babies
of
the
third
division
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
could
I
say
to
all
this
?
<EOS>
Really
nothing
;
and
I
hoped
he
would
allow
me
to
be
silent
.
<EOS>
The
storm
recommenced
.
  
<EOS>
"
Every
answer
to
his
queries
was
then
refused
?
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
be
considered
in
_
that
_
place
 
that
conceited
boudoir
of
a
first
classe
,
with
its
pretentious
book
-
cases
,
its
green
-
baized
desks
,
its
rubbish
of
flower
-
stands
,
its
trash
of
framed
pictures
and
maps
,
and
its
foreign
surveillante
,
forsooth
!
 
<EOS>
it
seemed
to
be
the
fashion
to
think
_
there
_
that
the
Professor
of
Literature
was
not
worthy
of
a
reply
!
<EOS>
These
were
new
ideas
;
imported
,
he
did
not
doubt
,
straight
from
"
la
Grande
Bretagne
:
"
they
savoured
of
island
insolence
and
arrogance
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lull
the
second
 
<EOS>
the
girls
,
not
one
of
whom
was
ever
known
to
weep
a
tear
for
the
rebukes
of
any
other
master
,
now
all
melting
like
snow
-
statues
before
the
intemperate
heat
of
M.
Emanuel
:
I
not
yet
much
shaken
,
sitting
down
,
and
venturing
to
resume
my
work
.
  
<EOS>
Something
 
either
in
my
continued
silence
or
in
the
movement
of
my
hand
,
stitching
 
transported
M.
Emanuel
beyond
the
last
boundary
of
patience
<EOS>
;
he
actually
sprang
from
his
estrade
.
<EOS>
The
stove
stood
near
my
desk
,
he
attacked
it
;
the
little
iron
door
was
nearly
dashed
from
its
hinges
,
the
fuel
was
made
to
fly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Est
-
ce
que
vous
avez
l'intention
de
m'insulter
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
to
me
,
in
a
low
,
furious
voice
,
as
he
thus
outraged
,
under
pretence
of
arranging
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
time
to
soothe
him
a
little
if
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mais
,
Monsieur
,
"
said
I
,
"
I
would
not
insult
you
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
remember
too
well
that
you
once
said
we
should
be
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
intend
my
voice
to
falter
,
but
it
did
:
<EOS>
more
,
I
think
,
through
the
agitation
of
late
delight
than
in
any
spasm
of
present
fear
.
<EOS>
Still
there
certainly
was
something
in
M.
Paul
's
anger
 
a
kind
of
passion
of
emotion
 
that
specially
tended
to
draw
tears
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
unhappy
,
nor
much
afraid
,
yet
I
wept
.
  
<EOS>
"
Allons
,
allons
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
presently
,
looking
round
and
seeing
the
deluge
universal
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Decidedly
I
am
a
monster
and
a
ruffian
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
one
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
"
he
added
,
"
<EOS>
but
if
I
had
twenty
,
I
would
offer
you
each
one
.
<EOS>
Your
teacher
shall
be
your
representative
.
<EOS>
Here
,
Miss
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
he
took
forth
and
held
out
to
me
a
clean
silk
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
Now
a
person
who
did
not
know
M.
Paul
,
who
was
unused
to
him
and
his
impulses
,
would
naturally
have
bungled
at
this
offer
 
declined
accepting
the
same
 
et
cetera
.
<EOS>
But
I
too
plainly
felt
this
would
never
do
:
the
slightest
hesitation
would
have
been
fatal
to
the
incipient
treaty
of
peace
.
<EOS>
I
rose
and
met
the
handkerchief
half
-
way
,
received
it
with
decorum
,
wiped
therewith
my
eyes
,
and
,
resuming
my
seat
,
and
retaining
the
flag
of
truce
in
my
hand
and
on
my
lap
,
took
especial
care
during
the
remainder
of
the
lesson
to
touch
neither
needle
nor
thimble
,
scissors
nor
muslin
.
<EOS>
Many
a
jealous
glance
did
M.
Paul
cast
at
these
implements
;
he
hated
them
mortally
,
considering
sewing
a
source
of
distraction
from
the
attention
due
to
himself
.
<EOS>
A
very
eloquent
lesson
he
gave
,
and
very
kind
and
friendly
was
he
to
the
close
.
<EOS>
Ere
he
had
done
,
the
clouds
were
dispersed
and
the
sun
shining
out
 
tears
were
exchanged
for
smiles
.
  
<EOS>
In
quitting
the
room
he
paused
once
more
at
my
desk
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
your
letter
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
this
time
not
quite
fiercely
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
yet
read
it
,
Monsieur
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
it
is
too
good
to
read
at
once
;
you
save
it
,
as
,
when
I
was
a
boy
,
I
used
to
save
a
peach
whose
bloom
was
very
ripe
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
guess
came
so
near
the
truth
,
I
could
not
prevent
a
suddenly
-
rising
warmth
in
my
face
from
revealing
as
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
promise
yourself
a
pleasant
moment
,
"
said
he
,
"
in
reading
that
letter
;
you
will
open
it
when
alone
 
n'est
-
ce
pas
?
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
a
smile
answers
.
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
one
should
not
be
too
harsh
;
"
la
jeunesse
n'a
qu'un
temps
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Monsieur
,
Monsieur
!
"
I
cried
,
or
rather
whispered
after
him
,
as
he
turned
to
go
,
"
do
not
leave
me
under
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
This
is
merely
a
friend
's
letter
.
<EOS>
Without
reading
it
,
I
can
vouch
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Je
conçois
,
je
conçois
:
on
sait
ce
que
c'est
qu'un
ami
.
<EOS>
Bonjour
,
Mademoiselle
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Monsieur
,
here
is
your
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
it
,
keep
it
,
till
the
letter
is
read
,
then
bring
it
me
;
I
shall
read
the
billet
's
tenor
in
your
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
he
was
gone
,
the
pupils
having
already
poured
out
of
the
schoolroom
into
the
berceau
,
and
thence
into
the
garden
and
court
to
take
their
customary
recreation
before
the
five
-
o'clock
dinner
,
I
stood
a
moment
thinking
,
and
absently
twisting
the
handkerchief
round
my
arm
.
<EOS>
For
some
reason
 
gladdened
,
I
think
,
by
a
sudden
return
of
the
golden
glimmer
of
childhood
,
roused
by
an
unwonted
renewal
of
its
buoyancy
,
made
merry
by
the
liberty
of
the
closing
hour
,
and
,
above
all
,
solaced
at
heart
by
the
joyous
consciousness
of
that
treasure
in
the
case
,
box
,
drawer
up
-
stairs
,
 
<EOS>
I
fell
to
playing
with
the
handkerchief
as
if
it
were
a
ball
,
casting
it
into
the
air
and
catching
it
 
as
it
fell
.
<EOS>
The
game
was
stopped
by
another
hand
than
mine
-
a
hand
emerging
from
a
paletôt
-
sleeve
and
stretched
over
my
shoulder
;
it
caught
the
extemporised
plaything
and
bore
it
away
with
these
sullen
words
:
  
"
Je
vois
bien
que
vous
vous
moquez
de
moi
et
de
mes
effets
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Really
that
little
man
was
dreadful
:
a
mere
sprite
of
caprice
and
,
ubiquity
:
<EOS>
one
never
knew
either
his
whim
or
his
whereabout
.
    
<EOS>
THE
LETTER
.
  
<EOS>
When
all
was
still
in
the
house
;
when
dinner
was
over
and
the
noisy
recreation
-
hour
past
;
when
darkness
had
set
in
,
and
the
quiet
lamp
of
study
was
lit
in
the
refectory
;
when
the
externes
were
gone
home
,
the
clashing
door
and
clamorous
bell
hushed
for
the
evening
;
when
Madame
was
safely
settled
in
the
salle
-
à
-
manger
in
company
with
her
mother
and
some
friends
;
I
then
glided
to
the
kitchen
,
begged
a
bougie
for
one
half
-
hour
for
a
particular
occasion
,
found
acceptance
of
my
petition
at
the
hands
of
my
friend
Goton
,
who
answered
,
"
Mais
certainement
,
chou
-
chou
,
vous
en
aurez
deux
,
si
vous
voulez
;
"
and
,
light
in
hand
<EOS>
,
I
mounted
noiseless
to
the
dormitory
.
  
<EOS>
Great
was
my
chagrin
to
find
in
that
apartment
a
pupil
gone
to
bed
indisposed
,
 
greater
when
I
recognised
,
amid
the
muslin
nightcap
borders
,
the
"
figure
chiffonnée
"
of
Mistress
Ginevra
Fanshawe
;
supine
at
this
moment
,
it
is
true
 
but
certain
to
wake
and
overwhelm
me
with
chatter
when
the
interruption
would
be
least
acceptable
:
indeed
,
as
I
watched
her
,
<EOS>
a
slight
twinkling
of
the
eyelids
warned
me
that
the
present
appearance
of
repose
might
be
but
a
ruse
,
assumed
to
cover
sly
vigilance
over
"
Timon
's
"
movements
;
she
was
not
to
be
trusted
.
<EOS>
And
I
had
so
wished
to
be
alone
,
just
to
read
my
precious
letter
in
peace
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
I
must
go
to
the
classes
.
<EOS>
Having
sought
and
found
my
prize
in
its
casket
,
I
descended
.
<EOS>
Ill
-
luck
pursued
me
.
<EOS>
The
classes
were
undergoing
sweeping
and
purification
by
candle
-
light
,
according
to
hebdomadal
custom
:
benches
were
piled
on
desks
,
the
air
was
dim
with
dust
,
damp
coffee
-
grounds
(
used
by
Labassecourien
housemaids
instead
of
tea
-
leaves
)
darkened
the
floor
;
all
was
hopeless
confusion
.
<EOS>
Baffled
,
but
not
beaten
<EOS>
,
I
withdrew
,
bent
as
resolutely
as
ever
on
finding
solitude
<EOS>
_
somewhere
<EOS>
_
.
  
<EOS>
Taking
a
key
whereof
I
knew
the
repository
,
I
mounted
three
staircases
in
succession
,
reached
a
dark
,
narrow
,
silent
landing
,
opened
a
worm
-
eaten
door
,
and
dived
into
the
deep
,
black
,
cold
garret
.
<EOS>
Here
none
would
follow
me
 
<EOS>
none
interrupt
 
not
Madame
herself
.
<EOS>
I
shut
the
garret
-
door
;
I
placed
my
light
on
a
doddered
and
mouldy
chest
of
drawers
;
I
put
on
a
shawl
,
for
the
air
was
ice
-
cold
;
I
took
my
letter
;
trembling
with
sweet
impatience
,
I
broke
its
seal
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
it
be
long
 
<EOS>
will
it
be
short
?
"
<EOS>
thought
I
,
passing
my
hand
across
my
eyes
to
dissipate
the
silvery
dimness
of
a
suave
,
south
-
wind
shower
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
long
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
it
be
cool
?
 
<EOS>
will
it
be
kind
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
kind
.
  
<EOS>
To
my
checked
,
bridled
,
disciplined
expectation
,
it
seemed
very
kind
:
to
my
longing
and
famished
thought
it
seemed
,
perhaps
,
kinder
than
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
So
little
had
I
hoped
,
so
much
had
I
feared
;
there
was
a
fulness
of
delight
in
this
taste
of
fruition
 
<EOS>
such
,
perhaps
,
as
many
a
human
being
passes
through
life
without
ever
knowing
.
<EOS>
The
poor
English
teacher
in
the
frosty
garret
,
reading
by
a
dim
candle
guttering
in
the
wintry
air
,
a
letter
simply
good
-
natured
 
nothing
more
;
though
that
good
-
nature
then
seemed
to
me
godlike
 
was
happier
than
most
queens
in
palaces
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
,
happiness
of
such
shallow
origin
could
be
but
brief
;
yet
,
while
it
lasted
it
was
genuine
and
exquisite
:
<EOS>
a
bubble
 
but
a
sweet
bubble
 
of
real
honey
-
dew
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
had
written
to
me
at
length
;
he
had
written
to
me
with
pleasure
;
he
had
written
with
benignant
mood
,
dwelling
with
sunny
satisfaction
on
scenes
that
had
passed
before
his
eyes
and
mine
,
 
on
places
we
had
visited
together
 
on
conversations
we
had
held
 
on
all
the
little
subject
-
matter
,
in
short
,
of
the
last
few
halcyon
weeks
.
<EOS>
But
the
cordial
core
of
the
delight
was
,
a
conviction
the
blithe
,
genial
language
generously
imparted
,
that
it
had
been
poured
out
not
merely
to
content
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
me
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
but
to
gratify
_
himself
_
.
<EOS>
A
gratification
he
might
never
more
desire
,
never
more
seek
 
an
hypothesis
in
every
point
of
view
approaching
the
certain
;
but
_
<EOS>
that
_
concerned
the
future
.
<EOS>
This
present
moment
had
no
pain
,
no
blot
,
no
want
;
full
,
pure
,
perfect
,
it
deeply
blessed
me
.
<EOS>
A
passing
seraph
seemed
to
have
rested
beside
me
,
leaned
towards
my
heart
,
and
reposed
on
its
throb
a
softening
,
cooling
,
healing
,
hallowing
wing
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
,
you
pained
me
afterwards
:
forgiven
be
every
ill
 
freely
forgiven
 
for
the
sake
of
that
one
dear
remembered
good
!
  
<EOS>
Are
there
wicked
things
,
not
human
,
which
envy
human
bliss
?
<EOS>
Are
there
evil
influences
haunting
the
air
,
and
poisoning
it
for
man
?
<EOS>
What
was
near
me
?
  
<EOS>
Something
in
that
vast
solitary
garret
sounded
strangely
.
<EOS>
Most
surely
and
certainly
I
heard
,
as
it
seemed
,
a
stealthy
foot
on
that
floor
:
a
sort
of
gliding
out
from
the
direction
of
the
black
recess
haunted
by
the
malefactor
cloaks
.
<EOS>
I
turned
:
my
light
was
dim
;
the
room
was
long
 
<EOS>
but
as
I
live
!
<EOS>
I
saw
in
the
middle
of
that
ghostly
chamber
a
figure
all
black
and
white
;
the
skirts
straight
,
narrow
,
black
;
the
head
bandaged
,
veiled
,
white
.
  
<EOS>
Say
what
you
will
,
reader
 
tell
me
I
was
nervous
or
mad
;
affirm
that
I
was
unsettled
by
the
excitement
of
that
letter
;
declare
that
I
dreamed
;
this
<EOS>
I
vow
 
<EOS>
I
saw
there
 
in
that
room
 
on
that
night
 
an
image
like
 
a
NUN
.
  
<EOS>
I
cried
out
;
I
sickened
.
<EOS>
Had
the
shape
approached
me
I
might
have
swooned
.
<EOS>
It
receded
:
I
made
for
the
door
.
<EOS>
How
I
descended
all
the
stairs
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
By
instinct
I
shunned
the
refectory
,
and
shaped
my
course
to
Madame
's
sitting
-
room
:
I
burst
in
.
<EOS>
I
said
    
"
There
is
something
in
the
grenier
;
I
have
been
there
:
I
saw
something
.
<EOS>
Go
and
look
at
it
,
all
of
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
All
of
you
;
"
for
the
room
seemed
to
me
full
of
people
,
though
in
truth
there
were
but
four
present
:
Madame
Beck
;
her
mother
,
Madame
Kint
,
who
was
out
of
health
,
and
now
staying
with
her
on
a
visit
;
her
brother
,
M.
Victor
Kint
,
and
another
gentleman
,
who
,
when
I
entered
the
room
,
was
conversing
with
the
old
lady
,
and
had
his
back
towards
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
My
mortal
fear
and
faintness
must
have
made
me
deadly
pale
.
<EOS>
I
felt
cold
and
shaking
.
<EOS>
They
all
rose
in
consternation
;
they
surrounded
me
.
<EOS>
I
urged
them
to
go
to
the
grenier
;
the
sight
of
the
gentlemen
did
me
good
and
gave
me
courage
:
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
some
help
and
hope
,
with
men
at
hand
.
<EOS>
I
turned
to
the
door
,
beckoning
them
to
follow
.
<EOS>
They
wanted
to
stop
me
,
but
I
said
they
must
come
this
way
<EOS>
:
they
must
see
what
I
had
seen
 
something
strange
,
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
garret
.
<EOS>
And
,
now
,
I
remembered
my
letter
,
left
on
the
drawers
with
the
light
.
<EOS>
This
precious
letter
!
<EOS>
Flesh
or
spirit
must
be
defied
for
its
sake
.
<EOS>
I
flew
up
-
stairs
,
hastening
the
faster
as
I
knew
I
was
followed
:
they
were
obliged
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
Lo
!
<EOS>
when
I
reached
the
garret
-
door
,
all
within
was
dark
as
a
pit
:
the
light
was
out
.
<EOS>
Happily
some
one
 
Madame
,
I
think
,
with
her
usual
calm
sense
 
had
brought
a
lamp
from
the
room
;
speedily
,
therefore
,
as
they
came
up
,
a
ray
pierced
the
opaque
blackness
.
<EOS>
There
stood
the
bougie
quenched
on
the
drawers
;
but
where
was
the
letter
?
<EOS>
And
I
looked
for
_
that
_
now
,
and
not
for
the
nun
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
letter
!
<EOS>
my
letter
!
<EOS>
"
I
panted
and
plained
,
almost
beside
myself
.
<EOS>
I
groped
on
the
floor
,
wringing
my
hands
wildly
.
<EOS>
Cruel
,
cruel
doom
!
<EOS>
To
have
my
bit
of
comfort
preternaturally
snatched
from
me
,
ere
<EOS>
I
had
well
tasted
its
virtue
!
  
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
the
others
were
doing
;
I
could
not
watch
them
:
they
asked
me
questions
I
did
not
answer
;
they
ransacked
all
corners
;
they
prattled
about
this
and
that
disarrangement
of
cloaks
,
a
breach
or
crack
in
the
sky
-
light
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
.
<EOS>
"
Something
or
somebody
has
been
here
,
"
was
sagely
averred
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
they
have
taken
my
letter
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
grovelling
,
groping
,
monomaniac
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
letter
,
Lucy
?
<EOS>
My
dear
girl
,
what
letter
?
<EOS>
"
asked
a
known
voice
in
my
ear
.
<EOS>
Could
I
believe
that
ear
?
<EOS>
No
:
<EOS>
and
I
looked
up
.
<EOS>
Could
I
trust
my
eyes
?
<EOS>
Had
I
recognised
the
tone
?
<EOS>
Did
I
now
look
on
the
face
of
the
writer
of
that
very
letter
?
<EOS>
Was
this
gentleman
near
me
in
this
dim
garret
,
John
Graham
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Bretton
himself
?
  
<EOS>
Yes
:
it
was
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
called
in
that
very
evening
to
prescribe
for
some
access
of
illness
in
old
Madame
Kint
;
he
was
the
second
gentleman
present
in
the
salle
-
à
-
manger
when
I
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
my
_
letter
,
Lucy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
own
:
<EOS>
yours
 
<EOS>
the
letter
you
wrote
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
come
here
to
read
it
quietly
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
find
another
spot
where
it
was
possible
to
have
it
to
myself
.
<EOS>
I
had
saved
it
all
day
 
never
opened
it
till
this
evening
:
<EOS>
it
was
scarcely
glanced
over
:
I
_
can
not
bear
_
to
lose
it
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
letter
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
do
n't
cry
and
distress
yourself
so
cruelly
.
<EOS>
What
is
it
worth
?
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
Come
out
of
this
cold
room
;
they
are
going
to
send
for
the
police
now
to
examine
further
:
we
need
not
stay
here
 
come
,
we
will
go
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
warm
hand
,
taking
my
cold
fingers
,
led
me
down
to
a
room
where
there
was
a
fire
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
and
I
sat
before
the
stove
.
<EOS>
He
talked
to
me
and
soothed
me
with
unutterable
goodness
,
promising
me
twenty
letters
for
the
one
lost
.
<EOS>
If
there
are
words
and
wrongs
like
knives
,
whose
deep
-
inflicted
lacerations
never
heal
 
cutting
injuries
and
insults
of
serrated
and
poison
-
dripping
edge
 
<EOS>
so
,
too
,
there
are
consolations
of
tone
too
fine
for
the
ear
not
fondly
and
for
ever
to
retain
their
echo
:
caressing
kindnesses
 
loved
,
lingered
over
through
a
whole
life
,
recalled
with
unfaded
tenderness
,
and
answering
the
call
with
undimmed
shine
,
out
of
that
raven
cloud
foreshadowing
Death
himself
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
told
since
that
Dr.
Bretton
was
not
nearly
so
perfect
as
I
thought
him
:
that
his
actual
character
lacked
the
depth
,
height
,
compass
,
and
endurance
it
possessed
in
my
creed
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
:
<EOS>
he
was
as
good
to
me
as
the
well
is
to
the
parched
wayfarer
 
as
the
sun
to
the
shivering
jailbird
.
<EOS>
I
remember
him
heroic
.
<EOS>
Heroic
at
this
moment
will
I
hold
him
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
asked
me
,
smiling
,
why
I
cared
for
his
letter
<EOS>
so
very
much
.
<EOS>
I
thought
,
but
did
not
say
,
that
I
prized
it
like
the
blood
in
my
veins
.
<EOS>
I
only
answered
that
I
had
so
few
letters
to
care
for
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
did
not
read
it
,
"
said
he
;
"
or
you
would
think
nothing
of
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
read
it
,
but
only
once
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
read
it
again
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
it
is
lost
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
could
not
help
weeping
afresh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
Lucy
,
my
poor
little
god
-
sister
(
if
there
be
such
a
relationship
)
,
here
 
_
here
<EOS>
_
is
your
letter
.
<EOS>
Why
is
it
not
better
worth
such
tears
,
and
such
tenderly
exaggerating
faith
?
"
  
<EOS>
Curious
,
characteristic
manoeuvre
!
<EOS>
His
quick
eye
had
seen
the
letter
on
the
floor
where
I
sought
it
;
his
hand
,
as
quick
,
had
snatched
it
up
.
<EOS>
He
had
hidden
it
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
.
<EOS>
If
my
trouble
had
wrought
with
a
whit
less
stress
and
reality
,
I
doubt
whether
he
would
ever
have
acknowledged
or
restored
it
.
<EOS>
Tears
of
temperature
one
degree
cooler
than
those
I
shed
would
only
have
amused
Dr.
John
.
  
<EOS>
Pleasure
at
regaining
made
me
forget
merited
reproach
for
the
teasing
torment
;
my
joy
was
great
;
it
could
not
be
concealed
:
yet
I
think
it
broke
out
more
in
countenance
than
language
.
<EOS>
I
said
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
satisfied
now
?
"
asked
Dr.
John
.
  
<EOS>
I
replied
that
I
was
 
satisfied
and
happy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
"
he
proceeded
,
"
how
do
you
feel
physically
?
<EOS>
Are
you
growing
calmer
?
<EOS>
Not
much
:
for
you
tremble
like
a
leaf
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
me
,
however
,
that
I
was
sufficiently
calm
:
at
least
I
felt
no
longer
terrified
.
<EOS>
I
expressed
myself
composed
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
able
,
consequently
,
to
tell
me
what
you
saw
?
<EOS>
Your
account
was
quite
vague
,
do
you
know
?
<EOS>
You
looked
white
as
the
wall
;
but
you
only
spoke
of
"
something
,
"
not
defining
_
<EOS>
what
_
.
<EOS>
Was
it
a
man
?
<EOS>
Was
it
an
animal
?
<EOS>
What
was
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
will
tell
exactly
what
I
saw
,
"
said
I
,
"
unless
some
one
else
sees
it
too
,
and
then
I
will
give
corroborative
testimony
;
but
otherwise
,
I
shall
be
discredited
and
accused
of
dreaming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
"
said
Dr.
Bretton
;
"
I
will
hear
it
in
my
professional
character
:
<EOS>
I
look
on
you
now
from
a
professional
point
of
view
,
and
I
read
,
perhaps
,
all
you
would
conceal
 
in
your
eye
,
which
is
curiously
vivid
and
restless
:
in
your
cheek
,
which
the
blood
has
forsaken
;
in
your
hand
,
which
you
can
not
steady
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Lucy
,
speak
and
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
laugh
 
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
tell
me
you
shall
have
no
more
letters
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
laughing
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
again
take
away
that
single
epistle
:
being
mine
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
have
a
right
to
reclaim
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
felt
raillery
in
his
words
:
it
made
me
grave
and
quiet
;
but
I
folded
up
the
letter
and
covered
it
from
sight
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
hide
it
,
but
I
can
possess
it
any
moment
I
choose
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
my
skill
in
sleight
of
hand
;
I
might
practise
as
a
conjuror
if
I
liked
.
<EOS>
Mamma
says
sometimes
,
too
,
that
I
have
a
harmonizing
property
of
tongue
and
eye
;
but
you
never
saw
that
in
me
 
did
you
,
Lucy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
 
indeed
 
when
you
were
a
mere
boy
I
used
to
see
both
:
far
more
then
than
now
 
for
now
you
are
strong
,
and
strength
dispenses
with
subtlety
.
<EOS>
But
still
,
 
Dr.
John
,
you
have
what
they
call
in
this
country
"
un
air
fin
,
"
that
nobody
can
,
mistake
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
saw
it
,
and
 
"
  
"
And
liked
it
,
"
said
he
,
laughing
,
"
because
she
has
it
herself
.
<EOS>
But
,
Lucy
,
give
me
that
letter
 
<EOS>
you
do
n't
really
care
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
this
provocative
speech
I
made
no
answer
.
<EOS>
Graham
in
mirthful
mood
must
not
be
humoured
too
far
.
<EOS>
Just
now
there
was
a
new
sort
of
smile
playing
about
his
lips
 
very
sweet
,
but
it
grieved
me
somehow
 
a
new
sort
of
light
sparkling
in
his
eyes
:
not
hostile
,
but
not
reassuring
.
<EOS>
I
rose
to
go
 
<EOS>
I
bid
him
good
-
night
a
little
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
His
sensitiveness
 
<EOS>
that
peculiar
,
apprehensive
,
detective
faculty
of
his
 
felt
in
a
moment
the
unspoken
complaint
 
the
scarce
-
thought
reproach
.
<EOS>
He
asked
quietly
if
I
was
offended
.
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
as
implying
a
negative
.
  
<EOS>
"
Permit
me
,
then
,
to
speak
a
little
seriously
to
you
before
you
go
.
<EOS>
You
are
in
a
highly
nervous
state
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
from
what
is
apparent
in
your
look
and
manner
,
however
well
controlled
,
<EOS>
that
whilst
alone
<EOS>
this
evening
in
that
dismal
,
perishing
sepulchral
garret
 
that
dungeon
under
the
leads
,
smelling
of
damp
and
mould
,
rank
with
phthisis
and
catarrh
:
a
place
you
never
ought
to
enter
 
that
you
saw
,
or
_
thought
_
you
saw
,
some
appearance
peculiarly
calculated
to
impress
the
imagination
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
you
_
are
_
not
,
nor
ever
were
,
subject
to
material
terrors
,
fears
of
robbers
,
&
c.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
so
sure
that
a
visitation
,
bearing
a
spectral
character
,
would
not
shake
your
very
mind
.
<EOS>
Be
calm
now
.
<EOS>
This
is
all
a
matter
of
the
nerves
,
I
see
:
but
just
specify
the
vision
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
tell
nobody
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
 
most
certainly
.
<EOS>
You
may
trust
me
as
implicitly
as
you
did
Père
Silas
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
doctor
is
perhaps
the
safer
confessor
of
the
two
,
though
he
has
not
grey
hair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
laugh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
may
,
to
do
you
good
:
but
not
in
scorn
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
I
feel
as
a
friend
towards
you
,
though
your
timid
nature
is
slow
to
trust
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
now
looked
like
a
friend
:
that
indescribable
smile
and
sparkle
were
gone
;
those
formidable
arched
curves
of
lip
,
nostril
,
eyebrow
,
were
depressed
;
repose
marked
his
attitude
 
attention
sobered
his
aspect
.
<EOS>
Won
to
confidence
,
I
told
him
exactly
what
I
had
seen
:
<EOS>
ere
<EOS>
now
I
had
narrated
to
him
the
legend
of
the
house
 
whiling
away
with
that
narrative
an
hour
of
a
certain
mild
October
afternoon
,
when
he
and
I
rode
through
Bois
l'Etang
.
  
<EOS>
He
sat
and
thought
,
and
while
he
thought
,
we
heard
them
all
coming
down
-
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
they
going
to
interrupt
?
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
glancing
at
the
door
with
an
annoyed
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
will
not
come
here
,
"
I
answered
;
for
we
were
in
the
little
salon
where
Madame
never
sat
in
the
evening
,
and
where
it
was
by
mere
chance
that
heat
was
still
lingering
in
the
stove
.
<EOS>
They
passed
the
door
and
went
on
to
the
salle
-
à
-
manger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
they
will
talk
about
thieves
,
burglars
,
and
so
on
:
let
them
do
<EOS>
so
 
<EOS>
mind
<EOS>
you
say
nothing
,
and
keep
your
resolution
of
describing
your
nun
to
nobody
.
<EOS>
She
may
appear
to
you
again
:
do
n't
start
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
then
,
"
I
said
,
with
secret
horror
,
"
she
came
out
of
my
brain
,
and
is
now
gone
in
there
,
and
may
glide
out
again
at
an
hour
and
a
day
when
I
look
not
for
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
a
case
of
spectral
illusion
:
I
fear
,
following
on
and
resulting
from
long
-
continued
mental
conflict
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Doctor
John
 
I
shudder
at
the
thought
of
being
liable
to
such
an
illusion
!
<EOS>
It
seemed
so
real
.
<EOS>
Is
there
no
cure
?
 
<EOS>
no
preventive
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Happiness
is
the
cure
 
<EOS>
a
cheerful
mind
<EOS>
the
preventive
:
cultivate
both
.
"
  
<EOS>
No
mockery
in
this
world
ever
sounds
to
me
so
hollow
as
that
of
being
told
to
_
<EOS>
cultivate
_
happiness
.
<EOS>
What
does
such
advice
mean
?
<EOS>
Happiness
is
not
a
potato
,
to
be
planted
in
mould
,
and
tilled
with
manure
.
<EOS>
Happiness
is
a
glory
shining
far
down
upon
us
out
of
Heaven
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
divine
dew
which
the
soul
,
on
certain
of
its
summer
mornings
,
feels
dropping
upon
it
from
the
amaranth
bloom
and
golden
fruitage
of
Paradise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cultivate
happiness
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
briefly
to
the
doctor
:
"
do
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
cultivate
happiness
?
<EOS>
How
do
you
manage
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
cheerful
fellow
by
nature
:
and
then
ill
-
luck
has
never
dogged
me
.
<EOS>
Adversity
gave
me
and
my
mother
one
passing
scowl
and
brush
,
but
we
defied
her
,
or
rather
laughed
at
her
,
and
she
went
by
.
"
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
cultivation
in
all
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
give
way
to
melancholy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
:
I
have
seen
you
subdued
by
that
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
About
Ginevra
Fanshawe
 
eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
she
not
sometimes
make
you
miserable
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Pooh
!
stuff
!
<EOS>
nonsense
!
<EOS>
You
see
I
am
better
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
a
laughing
eye
with
a
lively
light
,
and
a
face
bright
with
beaming
and
healthy
energy
,
could
attest
that
he
was
better
,
better
he
certainly
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
look
much
amiss
,
or
greatly
out
of
condition
,
"
I
allowed
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
,
Lucy
,
ca
n't
you
look
and
feel
as
I
do
 
buoyant
,
courageous
,
and
fit
to
defy
all
the
nuns
and
flirts
in
Christendom
?
<EOS>
I
would
give
gold
on
the
spot
just
to
see
you
snap
your
fingers
.
<EOS>
Try
the
manoeuvre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
to
bring
Miss
Fanshawe
into
your
presence
just
now
?
"
  
"
I
vow
,
Lucy
,
she
should
not
move
me
:
or
,
she
should
move
me
<EOS>
but
by
one
thing
 
true
,
yes
,
and
passionate
love
.
<EOS>
I
would
accord
forgiveness
at
no
less
a
price
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
a
smile
of
hers
would
have
been
a
fortune
to
you
a
while
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Transformed
,
Lucy
:
transformed
!
<EOS>
Remember
,
you
once
called
me
a
slave
!
<EOS>
but
I
am
a
free
man
now
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
stood
up
:
in
the
port
of
his
head
,
the
carriage
of
his
figure
,
in
his
beaming
eye
and
mien
,
there
revealed
itself
a
liberty
which
was
more
than
ease
 
<EOS>
a
mood
which
was
disdain
of
his
past
bondage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Fanshawe
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
has
led
me
through
a
phase
of
feeling
which
is
over
:
I
have
entered
another
condition
,
and
am
now
much
disposed
to
exact
love
for
love
 
passion
for
passion
 
and
good
measure
of
it
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Doctor
!
<EOS>
Doctor
!
<EOS>
you
said
it
was
your
nature
to
pursue
Love
under
difficulties
 
to
be
charmed
by
a
proud
insensibility
!
"
.
  
<EOS>
He
laughed
,
and
answered
,
"
My
nature
varies
:
the
mood
of
one
hour
is
sometimes
the
mockery
of
the
next
.
<EOS>
Well
,
Lucy
"
(
drawing
on
his
gloves
)
,
"
will
the
Nun
come
again
to
-
night
,
think
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
she
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
her
my
compliments
,
if
she
does
 
Dr.
John
's
compliments
 
and
entreat
her
to
have
the
goodness
to
wait
a
visit
from
him
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
was
she
a
pretty
nun
?
<EOS>
Had
she
a
pretty
face
?
<EOS>
You
have
not
told
me
that
yet
;
and
_
that
_
is
the
really
important
point
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
had
a
white
cloth
over
her
face
,
"
said
I
,
"
but
her
eyes
glittered
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Confusion
to
her
goblin
trappings
!
"
cried
he
,
irreverently
:
"
but
at
least
she
had
handsome
eyes
 
bright
and
soft
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cold
and
fixed
,
"
was
the
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
we
'll
none
of
her
:
she
shall
not
haunt
you
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Give
her
that
shake
of
the
hand
,
if
she
comes
again
.
<EOS>
Will
she
stand
_
that
_
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
it
too
kind
and
cordial
for
a
ghost
to
stand
:
and
so
was
the
smile
which
matched
it
,
and
accompanied
his
"
Good
-
night
.
"
     
<EOS>
And
had
there
been
anything
in
the
garret
?
<EOS>
What
did
they
discover
?
<EOS>
I
believe
,
on
the
closest
examination
,
their
discoveries
amounted
to
very
little
.
<EOS>
They
talked
,
at
first
,
of
the
cloaks
being
disturbed
;
but
Madame
Beck
told
me
afterwards
she
thought
they
hung
much
as
usual
:
and
as
for
the
broken
pane
in
the
skylight
,
she
affirmed
that
aperture
was
rarely
without
one
or
more
panes
broken
or
cracked
:
and
besides
,
a
heavy
hail
-
storm
had
fallen
a
few
days
ago
.
<EOS>
Madame
questioned
me
very
closely
as
to
what
I
had
seen
,
but
I
only
described
an
obscure
figure
clothed
in
black
:
<EOS>
I
took
care
not
to
breathe
the
word
"
nun
,
"
certain
that
this
word
would
at
once
suggest
to
her
mind
an
idea
of
romance
and
unreality
.
<EOS>
She
charged
me
to
say
nothing
on
the
subject
to
any
servant
,
pupil
,
or
teacher
,
and
highly
commended
my
discretion
in
coming
to
her
private
salle
-
à
-
manger
,
instead
of
carrying
the
tale
of
horror
to
the
school
refectory
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
subject
dropped
.
<EOS>
I
was
left
secretly
and
sadly
to
wonder
,
in
my
own
mind
,
whether
that
strange
thing
was
of
this
world
,
or
of
a
realm
beyond
the
grave
;
or
whether
indeed
it
was
only
the
child
of
malady
,
and
I
of
that
malady
the
prey
.
    
<EOS>
VASHTI
.
  
<EOS>
To
wonder
sadly
,
did
I
say
?
<EOS>
No
:
a
new
influence
began
to
act
upon
my
life
,
and
sadness
,
for
a
certain
space
,
was
held
at
bay
.
<EOS>
Conceive
a
dell
,
deep
-
hollowed
in
forest
secresy
;
it
lies
in
dimness
and
mist
:
<EOS>
its
turf
is
dank
,
its
herbage
pale
and
humid
.
<EOS>
A
storm
or
an
axe
makes
a
wide
gap
amongst
the
oak
-
trees
;
the
breeze
sweeps
in
;
the
sun
looks
down
;
the
sad
,
cold
dell
becomes
a
deep
cup
of
lustre
;
high
summer
pours
her
blue
glory
and
her
golden
light
out
of
that
beauteous
sky
,
which
till
now
the
starved
hollow
never
saw
.
  
<EOS>
A
new
creed
became
mine
 
a
belief
in
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
three
weeks
since
the
adventure
of
the
garret
,
and
I
possessed
in
that
case
,
box
,
drawer
up
-
stairs
,
casketed
with
that
first
letter
,
<EOS>
four
companions
like
to
it
,
traced
by
the
same
firm
pen
,
sealed
with
the
same
clear
seal
,
full
of
the
same
vital
comfort
.
<EOS>
Vital
comfort
it
seemed
to
me
then
:
I
read
them
in
after
years
;
they
were
kind
letters
enough
 
pleasing
letters
,
because
composed
by
one
well
pleased
;
in
the
two
last
there
were
three
or
four
closing
lines
half
-
gay
,
half
-
tender
,
"
by
_
feeling
<EOS>
_
touched
,
but
not
subdued
.
<EOS>
"
Time
,
dear
reader
,
mellowed
them
to
a
beverage
of
this
mild
quality
;
but
when
I
first
tasted
their
elixir
,
fresh
from
the
fount
<EOS>
so
honoured
,
it
seemed
juice
of
a
divine
vintage
:
a
draught
which
Hebe
might
fill
,
and
the
very
gods
approve
.
  
<EOS>
Does
the
reader
,
remembering
what
was
said
some
pages
back
,
care
to
ask
how
I
answered
these
letters
:
whether
under
the
dry
,
stinting
check
of
Reason
,
or
according
to
the
full
,
liberal
impulse
of
Feeling
?
  
<EOS>
To
speak
truth
,
I
compromised
matters
;
I
served
two
masters
:
<EOS>
I
bowed
down
in
the
houses
of
Rimmon
,
and
lifted
the
heart
at
another
shrine
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
to
these
letters
two
answers
 
one
for
my
own
relief
,
the
other
for
Graham
's
perusal
.
  
<EOS>
To
begin
with
:
Feeling
and
I
turned
Reason
out
of
doors
,
drew
against
her
bar
and
bolt
,
then
we
sat
down
,
spread
our
paper
,
dipped
in
the
ink
an
eager
pen
,
and
,
with
deep
enjoyment
,
poured
out
our
sincere
heart
.
<EOS>
When
we
had
done
 
when
two
sheets
were
covered
with
the
language
of
a
strongly
-
adherent
affection
,
a
rooted
and
active
gratitude
 
(
once
,
for
all
,
in
this
parenthesis
,
I
disclaim
,
with
the
utmost
scorn
,
every
sneaking
suspicion
of
what
are
called
"
warmer
feelings
:
"
women
do
not
entertain
these
"
warmer
feelings
"
where
,
from
the
commencement
,
through
the
whole
progress
of
an
acquaintance
,
they
have
never
once
been
cheated
of
the
conviction
that
,
to
do
so
would
be
to
commit
a
mortal
absurdity
:
nobody
ever
launches
into
Love
unless
he
has
seen
or
dreamed
the
rising
of
Hope
's
star
over
Love
's
troubled
waters
)
 
<EOS>
when
,
then
,
I
had
given
expression
to
a
closely
-
clinging
and
deeply
-
honouring
attachment
 
an
attachment
that
wanted
to
attract
to
itself
and
take
to
its
own
lot
all
that
was
painful
in
the
destiny
of
its
object
;
that
would
,
if
it
could
,
have
absorbed
and
conducted
away
all
storms
and
lightnings
from
an
existence
viewed
with
a
passion
of
solicitude
 
then
,
just
at
that
moment
,
the
doors
of
my
heart
would
shake
,
bolt
and
bar
would
yield
,
Reason
would
leap
in
vigorous
and
revengeful
,
snatch
the
full
sheets
,
read
,
sneer
,
erase
,
tear
up
,
re
-
write
,
fold
,
seal
,
direct
,
and
send
a
terse
,
curt
missive
of
a
page
.
<EOS>
She
did
right
.
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
live
on
letters
only
<EOS>
:
I
was
visited
,
I
was
looked
after
;
once
a
week
I
was
taken
out
to
La
Terrasse
;
always
I
was
made
much
of
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Bretton
failed
not
to
tell
me
_
why
_
<EOS>
he
was
so
kind
:
"
<EOS>
To
keep
away
the
nun
,
"
he
said
;
"
he
was
determined
to
dispute
with
her
her
prey
.
<EOS>
He
had
taken
,
"
he
declared
,
"
a
thorough
dislike
to
her
,
chiefly
on
account
of
that
white
face
-
cloth
,
and
those
cold
grey
eyes
:
<EOS>
the
moment
he
heard
of
those
odious
particulars
,
"
he
affirmed
,
"
consummate
disgust
had
incited
him
to
oppose
her
;
he
was
determined
to
try
whether
he
or
she
was
the
cleverest
,
and
he
only
wished
she
would
once
more
look
in
upon
me
when
he
was
present
:
"
but
_
that
_
she
never
did
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
regarded
me
scientifically
in
the
light
of
a
patient
,
and
at
once
exercised
his
professional
skill
,
and
gratified
his
natural
benevolence
,
by
a
course
of
cordial
and
attentive
treatment
.
  
<EOS>
One
evening
,
the
first
in
December
,
I
was
walking
by
myself
in
the
carré
;
it
was
six
o'clock
;
the
classe
-
doors
were
closed
;
but
within
,
the
pupils
,
rampant
in
the
licence
of
evening
recreation
,
were
counterfeiting
a
miniature
chaos
.
<EOS>
The
carré
was
quite
dark
,
except
a
red
light
shining
under
and
about
the
stove
;
the
wide
glass
-
doors
and
the
long
windows
were
frosted
over
;
a
crystal
sparkle
of
starlight
,
here
and
there
spangling
this
blanched
winter
veil
,
and
breaking
with
scattered
brilliance
the
paleness
of
its
embroidery
,
proved
it
a
clear
night
,
though
moonless
.
<EOS>
That
I
should
dare
to
remain
thus
alone
in
darkness
,
showed
that
my
nerves
were
regaining
a
healthy
tone
<EOS>
:
I
thought
of
the
nun
,
but
hardly
feared
her
;
though
the
staircase
was
behind
me
,
leading
up
,
through
blind
,
black
night
,
from
landing
to
landing
,
to
the
haunted
grenier
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
own
my
heart
quaked
,
<EOS>
my
pulse
leaped
,
when
I
suddenly
heard
breathing
and
rustling
,
and
turning
,
saw
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
steps
a
deeper
shadow
<EOS>
still
 
a
shape
that
moved
and
descended
.
<EOS>
It
paused
a
while
at
the
classe
-
door
,
and
then
it
glided
before
me
.
<EOS>
Simultaneously
came
a
clangor
of
the
distant
door
-
bell
.
<EOS>
Life
-
like
sounds
bring
life
-
like
feelings
:
this
shape
was
too
round
and
low
for
my
gaunt
nun
<EOS>
:
it
was
only
Madame
Beck
on
duty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
Lucy
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rosine
,
bursting
in
,
lamp
in
hand
,
from
the
corridor
,
"
on
est
là
pour
vous
au
salon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Madame
saw
me
,
I
saw
Madame
,
Rosine
saw
us
both
:
there
was
no
mutual
recognition
.
<EOS>
I
made
straight
for
the
salon
.
<EOS>
There
I
found
what
I
own
<EOS>
I
anticipated
I
should
find
 
Dr.
Bretton
;
but
he
was
in
evening
-
dress
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
carriage
is
at
the
door
,
"
said
he
;
"
my
mother
has
sent
it
to
take
you
to
the
theatre
;
she
was
going
herself
,
but
an
arrival
has
prevented
her
:
she
immediately
said
,
"
Take
Lucy
in
my
place
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
now
?
<EOS>
I
am
not
dressed
,
"
cried
I
,
glancing
despairingly
at
my
dark
merino
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
half
an
hour
to
dress
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
given
you
notice
,
but
I
only
determined
on
going
since
five
o'clock
,
when
I
heard
there
was
to
be
a
genuine
regale
in
the
presence
of
a
great
actress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
he
mentioned
a
name
that
thrilled
me
 
a
name
that
,
in
those
days
,
could
thrill
Europe
.
<EOS>
It
is
hushed
now
:
its
once
restless
echoes
are
all
still
;
she
who
bore
it
went
years
ago
to
her
rest
:
night
and
oblivion
long
since
closed
above
her
;
but
_
then
_
her
day
 
a
day
of
Sirius
 
stood
at
its
full
height
,
light
and
fervour
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
;
I
will
be
ready
in
ten
minutes
,
"
I
vowed
.
<EOS>
And
away
I
flew
,
never
once
checked
,
reader
,
by
the
thought
which
perhaps
at
this
moment
checks
you
:
namely
,
that
to
go
anywhere
with
Graham
and
without
Mrs.
Bretton
could
be
objectionable
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
conceived
,
much
less
have
expressed
to
Graham
,
<EOS>
such
thought
 
<EOS>
such
scruple
 
<EOS>
without
risk
of
exciting
a
tyrannous
self
-
contempt
:
of
kindling
an
inward
fire
of
shame
so
quenchless
,
and
so
devouring
,
that
I
think
it
would
soon
have
licked
up
the
very
life
in
my
veins
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
my
godmother
,
knowing
her
son
,
and
knowing
me
,
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
chaperoning
a
sister
with
a
brother
,
as
of
keeping
anxious
guard
over
our
incomings
and
outgoings
.
  
<EOS>
The
present
was
no
occasion
for
showy
array
;
my
dun
mist
crape
would
suffice
,
and
I
sought
the
same
in
the
great
oak
-
wardrobe
in
the
dormitory
,
where
hung
no
less
than
forty
dresses
.
<EOS>
But
there
had
been
changes
and
reforms
,
and
some
innovating
hand
had
pruned
this
same
crowded
wardrobe
,
and
carried
divers
garments
to
the
grenier
 
my
crape
amongst
the
rest
.
<EOS>
I
must
fetch
it
.
<EOS>
I
got
the
key
,
and
went
aloft
fearless
,
almost
thoughtless
.
<EOS>
I
unlocked
the
door
,
I
plunged
in
.
<EOS>
The
reader
may
believe
it
or
not
,
but
when
I
thus
suddenly
entered
,
that
garret
was
not
wholly
dark
as
it
should
have
been
:
from
one
point
there
shone
a
solemn
light
,
like
a
star
,
but
broader
.
<EOS>
So
plainly
it
shone
,
that
it
revealed
the
deep
alcove
with
a
portion
of
the
tarnished
scarlet
curtain
drawn
over
it
.
<EOS>
Instantly
,
silently
,
before
my
eyes
,
it
vanished
;
so
did
the
curtain
and
alcove
:
<EOS>
all
that
end
of
the
garret
became
black
as
night
.
<EOS>
I
ventured
no
research
;
I
had
not
time
nor
will
;
snatching
my
dress
,
which
hung
on
the
wall
,
happily
near
the
door
,
I
rushed
out
,
relocked
the
door
with
convulsed
haste
,
and
darted
downwards
to
the
dormitory
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
trembled
too
much
to
dress
myself
:
impossible
to
arrange
hair
or
fasten
hooks
-
and
-
eyes
with
such
fingers
,
so
I
called
Rosine
and
bribed
her
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
Rosine
liked
a
bribe
,
so
she
did
her
best
,
smoothed
and
plaited
my
hair
as
well
as
a
coiffeur
would
have
done
,
placed
the
lace
collar
mathematically
straight
,
tied
the
neck
-
ribbon
accurately
 
in
short
,
did
her
work
like
the
neat
-
handed
Phillis
<EOS>
she
could
be
when
she
those
.
<EOS>
Having
given
me
my
handkerchief
and
gloves
,
she
took
the
candle
and
lighted
me
down
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
I
had
forgotten
my
shawl
;
she
ran
back
to
fetch
it
;
and
I
stood
with
Dr.
John
in
the
vestibule
,
waiting
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
,
Lucy
?
"
said
he
,
looking
down
at
me
narrowly
.
<EOS>
"
Here
is
the
old
excitement
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
the
nun
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
I
utterly
denied
the
charge
:
I
was
vexed
to
be
suspected
of
a
second
illusion
.
<EOS>
He
was
sceptical
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
,
as
sure
as
I
live
,
"
said
he
;
"
her
figure
crossing
your
eyes
leaves
on
them
a
peculiar
gleam
and
expression
not
to
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
_
not
_
been
,
"
<EOS>
I
persisted
:
for
,
indeed
,
I
could
deny
her
apparition
with
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
old
symptoms
are
there
,
"
he
affirmed
:
"
a
particular
pale
,
and
what
the
Scotch
call
a
"
raised
"
look
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
so
obstinate
<EOS>
,
I
thought
it
better
to
tell
him
what
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
really
_
had
_
seen
.
<EOS>
Of
course
with
him
it
was
held
to
be
another
effect
of
the
same
cause
:
it
was
all
optical
illusion
 
nervous
malady
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
Not
one
bit
did
I
believe
him
;
but
I
dared
not
contradict
:
doctors
are
so
self
-
opinionated
,
so
immovable
in
their
dry
,
materialist
views
.
  
<EOS>
Rosine
brought
the
shawl
,
and
I
was
bundled
into
the
carriage
.
     
<EOS>
The
theatre
was
full
 
crammed
to
its
roof
:
<EOS>
royal
and
noble
were
there
:
<EOS>
palace
and
hotel
had
emptied
their
inmates
into
those
tiers
so
thronged
and
so
hushed
.
<EOS>
Deeply
did
I
feel
myself
privileged
in
having
a
place
before
that
stage
;
I
longed
to
see
a
being
of
whose
powers
I
had
heard
reports
which
made
me
conceive
peculiar
anticipations
.
<EOS>
I
wondered
if
she
would
justify
her
renown
:
with
strange
curiosity
,
with
feelings
severe
and
austere
,
yet
of
riveted
interest
,
I
waited
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
study
of
such
nature
as
had
not
encountered
my
eyes
yet
:
a
great
and
new
planet
<EOS>
she
was
:
<EOS>
but
in
what
shape
?
<EOS>
I
waited
her
rising
.
  
<EOS>
She
rose
at
nine
that
December
night
:
above
the
horizon
I
saw
her
come
.
<EOS>
She
could
shine
yet
with
pale
grandeur
and
steady
might
;
but
that
star
verged
already
on
its
judgment
-
day
.
<EOS>
Seen
near
,
it
was
a
chaos
 
<EOS>
hollow
,
half
-
consumed
:
an
orb
perished
or
perishing
 
half
lava
,
half
glow
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
heard
this
woman
termed
"
plain
,
"
and
I
expected
bony
harshness
and
grimness
 
something
large
,
angular
,
sallow
.
<EOS>
What
I
saw
was
the
shadow
of
a
royal
Vashti
:
a
queen
,
fair
as
the
day
once
,
turned
pale
now
like
twilight
,
and
wasted
like
wax
in
flame
.
  
<EOS>
For
awhile
 
a
long
while
 
I
thought
it
was
only
a
woman
,
though
an
unique
woman
,
Who
moved
in
might
and
grace
before
this
multitude
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
I
recognised
my
mistake
.
<EOS>
Behold
!
<EOS>
I
found
upon
her
something
neither
of
woman
nor
of
man
:
in
each
of
her
eyes
sat
a
devil
.
<EOS>
These
evil
forces
bore
her
through
the
tragedy
,
kept
up
her
feeble
strength
 
<EOS>
for
she
was
but
a
frail
creature
;
and
as
the
action
rose
and
the
stir
deepened
,
how
wildly
they
shook
her
with
their
passions
of
the
pit
!
<EOS>
They
wrote
HELL
on
her
straight
,
haughty
brow
.
<EOS>
They
tuned
her
voice
to
the
note
of
torment
.
<EOS>
They
writhed
her
regal
face
to
a
demoniac
mask
.
<EOS>
Hate
and
Murder
and
Madness
incarnate
she
stood
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
marvellous
sight
:
a
mighty
revelation
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
spectacle
low
,
horrible
,
immoral
.
  
<EOS>
Swordsmen
thrust
through
,
and
dying
in
their
blood
on
the
arena
sand
;
bulls
goring
horses
disembowelled
,
made
a
meeker
vision
for
the
public
 
a
milder
condiment
for
a
people
's
palate
 
than
Vashti
torn
by
seven
devils
:
devils
which
cried
sore
and
rent
the
tenement
they
haunted
,
but
still
refused
to
be
exorcised
.
  
<EOS>
Suffering
had
struck
that
stage
empress
;
and
she
stood
before
her
audience
neither
yielding
to
,
nor
enduring
,
nor
,
in
finite
measure
,
resenting
it
:
she
stood
locked
in
struggle
,
rigid
in
resistance
.
<EOS>
She
stood
,
not
dressed
,
but
draped
in
pale
antique
folds
,
long
and
regular
like
sculpture
.
<EOS>
A
background
and
entourage
and
flooring
of
deepest
crimson
threw
her
out
,
white
like
alabaster
 
like
silver
:
rather
,
be
it
said
,
like
Death
.
  
<EOS>
Where
was
the
artist
of
the
Cleopatra
?
<EOS>
Let
him
come
and
sit
down
and
study
this
different
vision
.
<EOS>
Let
him
seek
here
the
mighty
brawn
,
the
muscle
,
the
abounding
blood
,
the
full
-
fed
flesh
he
worshipped
:
<EOS>
let
all
materialists
draw
nigh
and
look
on
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
said
that
she
does
not
_
resent
_
her
grief
.
<EOS>
No
;
the
weakness
of
that
word
would
make
it
a
lie
.
<EOS>
To
her
,
what
hurts
becomes
immediately
embodied
:
she
looks
on
it
as
a
thing
that
can
be
attacked
,
worried
down
,
torn
in
shreds
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
a
substance
herself
,
she
grapples
to
conflict
with
abstractions
.
<EOS>
Before
calamity
she
is
a
tigress
;
she
rends
her
woes
,
shivers
them
in
convulsed
abhorrence
.
<EOS>
Pain
,
for
her
,
has
no
result
in
good
:
<EOS>
tears
water
<EOS>
no
harvest
of
wisdom
<EOS>
:
on
sickness
,
on
death
itself
,
she
looks
with
the
eye
of
a
rebel
.
<EOS>
Wicked
,
<EOS>
perhaps
,
she
is
,
but
also
she
is
strong
;
and
her
strength
has
conquered
Beauty
,
has
overcome
Grace
,
and
bound
both
at
her
side
,
captives
peerlessly
fair
,
and
docile
as
fair
.
<EOS>
Even
in
the
uttermost
frenzy
of
energy
is
each
maenad
movement
royally
,
imperially
,
incedingly
upborne
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
,
flying
loose
in
revel
or
war
,
is
still
an
angel
's
hair
,
and
glorious
under
a
halo
.
<EOS>
Fallen
,
insurgent
,
banished
<EOS>
,
she
remembers
the
heaven
where
she
rebelled
.
<EOS>
Heaven
's
light
,
following
her
exile
,
pierces
its
confines
,
and
discloses
their
forlorn
remoteness
.
  
<EOS>
Place
now
the
Cleopatra
,
or
any
other
slug
,
before
her
as
an
obstacle
,
and
see
her
cut
through
the
pulpy
mass
as
the
scimitar
of
Saladin
clove
the
down
cushion
.
<EOS>
Let
Paul
Peter
Rubens
wake
from
the
dead
,
let
him
rise
out
of
his
cerements
,
and
bring
into
this
presence
all
the
army
of
his
fat
women
;
the
magian
power
or
prophet
-
virtue
gifting
that
slight
rod
of
Moses
,
could
,
at
one
waft
,
release
and
re
-
mingle
a
sea
spell
-
parted
,
whelming
the
heavy
host
with
the
down
-
rush
of
overthrown
sea
-
ramparts
.
  
<EOS>
Vashti
was
not
good
,
I
was
told
;
and
I
have
said
she
did
not
look
good
:
though
a
spirit
,
she
was
a
spirit
out
of
Tophet
.
<EOS>
Well
,
if
so
much
of
unholy
force
can
arise
from
below
,
may
not
an
equal
efflux
of
sacred
essence
descend
one
day
from
above
?
  
<EOS>
What
thought
Dr.
Graham
of
this
being
?
  
<EOS>
For
long
intervals
I
forgot
to
look
how
he
demeaned
himself
,
or
to
question
what
he
thought
.
<EOS>
The
strong
magnetism
of
genius
drew
my
heart
out
of
its
wonted
orbit
;
the
sunflower
turned
from
the
south
to
a
fierce
light
,
not
solar
 
a
rushing
,
red
,
cometary
light
 
hot
on
vision
and
to
sensation
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
acting
before
,
but
never
anything
like
this
:
never
anything
which
astonished
Hope
and
hushed
Desire
;
which
outstripped
Impulse
and
paled
Conception
;
which
,
instead
of
merely
irritating
imagination
with
the
thought
of
what
_
might
_
be
done
,
at
the
same
time
fevering
the
nerves
because
it
was
_
not
_
done
,
disclosed
power
like
a
deep
,
swollen
winter
river
,
thundering
in
cataract
,
and
bearing
the
soul
,
like
a
leaf
,
on
the
steep
and
steelly
sweep
of
its
descent
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Fanshawe
,
with
her
usual
ripeness
of
judgment
,
pronounced
Dr.
Bretton
a
serious
,
impassioned
man
,
too
grave
and
too
impressible
.
<EOS>
Not
in
such
light
did
I
ever
see
him
:
<EOS>
no
such
faults
<EOS>
could
I
lay
to
his
charge
.
<EOS>
His
natural
attitude
was
not
the
meditative
,
nor
his
natural
mood
the
sentimental
;
_
impressionable
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
he
was
as
dimpling
water
,
but
,
almost
as
water
,
_
unimpressible
:
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
the
breeze
,
the
sun
,
moved
him
 
metal
could
not
grave
,
nor
fire
brand
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
John
_
could
_
think
and
think
well
,
but
he
was
rather
a
man
of
action
than
of
thought
;
he
_
could
_
feel
,
and
feel
vividly
in
his
way
,
but
his
heart
had
no
chord
for
enthusiasm
:
to
bright
,
soft
,
sweet
influences
<EOS>
his
eyes
and
lips
gave
bright
,
soft
,
sweet
welcome
,
beautiful
to
see
as
dyes
of
rose
and
silver
,
pearl
and
purple
,
imbuing
summer
clouds
;
<EOS>
for
what
belonged
to
storm
,
what
was
wild
and
intense
,
dangerous
,
sudden
,
and
flaming
,
he
had
no
sympathy
,
and
held
with
it
no
communion
.
<EOS>
When
I
took
time
and
regained
inclination
to
glance
at
him
,
it
amused
and
enlightened
me
to
discover
that
he
was
watching
that
sinister
and
sovereign
Vashti
,
not
with
wonder
,
nor
worship
,
nor
yet
dismay
,
but
simply
with
intense
curiosity
.
<EOS>
Her
agony
did
not
pain
him
,
her
wild
moan
 
worse
than
a
shriek
 
<EOS>
did
not
much
move
him
;
her
fury
revolted
him
somewhat
,
but
not
to
the
point
of
horror
.
<EOS>
Cool
young
Briton
!
<EOS>
The
pale
cliffs
of
his
own
England
do
not
look
down
on
the
tides
of
the
Channel
more
calmly
than
he
watched
the
Pythian
inspiration
of
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
Looking
at
his
face
,
I
longed
to
know
his
exact
opinions
,
and
at
last
I
put
a
question
tending
to
elicit
them
.
<EOS>
At
the
sound
of
my
voice
he
awoke
as
if
out
of
a
dream
;
for
he
had
been
thinking
,
and
very
intently
thinking
,
his
own
thoughts
,
after
his
own
manner
.
<EOS>
"
How
did
he
like
Vashti
?
<EOS>
"
I
wished
to
know
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hm
-
m
-
m
,
"
was
the
first
scarce
articulate
but
expressive
answer
;
and
then
such
a
strange
smile
went
wandering
round
his
lips
,
a
smile
so
critical
,
so
almost
callous
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
for
natures
of
that
order
his
sympathies
_
were
_
callous
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
terse
phrases
he
told
me
his
opinion
of
,
and
feeling
towards
,
the
actress
<EOS>
:
he
judged
her
as
a
woman
,
not
an
artist
:
it
was
a
branding
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
That
night
was
already
marked
in
my
book
of
life
,
not
with
white
,
but
with
a
deep
-
red
cross
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
not
done
with
it
yet
;
and
other
memoranda
were
destined
to
be
set
down
in
characters
of
tint
indelible
.
  
<EOS>
Towards
midnight
,
when
the
deepening
tragedy
blackened
to
the
death
-
scene
,
and
all
held
their
breath
,
and
even
Graham
bit
his
under
-
lip
,
and
knit
his
brow
,
and
sat
still
and
struck
 
when
the
whole
theatre
was
hushed
,
when
the
vision
of
all
eyes
centred
in
one
point
,
when
all
ears
listened
towards
one
quarter
 
nothing
being
seen
but
the
white
form
sunk
on
a
seat
,
quivering
in
conflict
with
her
last
,
her
worst
-
hated
,
her
visibly
-
conquering
foe
 
<EOS>
nothing
heard
but
her
throes
,
her
gaspings
,
breathing
yet
of
mutiny
,
panting
still
defiance
;
when
,
as
it
seemed
,
an
inordinate
will
,
convulsing
a
perishing
mortal
frame
,
bent
it
to
battle
with
doom
and
death
,
fought
every
inch
of
ground
,
sold
every
drop
of
blood
,
resisted
to
the
latest
the
rape
of
every
faculty
,
_
would
_
see
,
_
<EOS>
would
_
hear
,
_
would
_
breathe
,
_
would
_
live
,
up
to
,
within
,
well
-
nigh
_
beyond
_
the
moment
when
death
says
to
all
sense
and
all
being
 
"
Thus
far
and
no
farther
!
"
    
<EOS>
Just
then
a
stir
,
pregnant
with
omen
,
rustled
behind
the
scenes
 
feet
ran
,
voices
spoke
.
<EOS>
What
was
it
?
<EOS>
demanded
the
whole
house
.
<EOS>
A
flame
,
a
smell
of
smoke
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fire
!
"
<EOS>
rang
through
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fire
!
"
was
repeated
,
re
-
echoed
,
yelled
forth
:
and
then
,
and
faster
than
pen
can
set
it
down
,
came
panic
,
rushing
,
crushing
 
a
blind
,
selfish
,
cruel
chaos
.
  
<EOS>
And
Dr.
John
?
<EOS>
Reader
,
I
see
him
yet
,
with
his
look
of
comely
courage
and
cordial
calm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
will
sit
still
,
I
know
,
"
said
he
,
glancing
down
at
me
with
the
same
serene
goodness
,
the
same
repose
of
firmness
that
I
have
seen
in
him
when
sitting
at
his
side
amid
the
secure
peace
of
his
mother
's
hearth
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
thus
adjured
,
I
think
I
would
have
sat
still
under
a
rocking
crag
:
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
to
sit
still
in
actual
circumstances
was
my
instinct
;
and
at
the
price
of
my
very
life
,
I
would
not
have
moved
to
give
him
trouble
,
thwart
his
will
,
or
make
demands
on
his
attention
.
<EOS>
We
were
in
the
stalls
,
and
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
most
terrible
,
ruthless
pressure
about
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
terrified
are
the
women
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
;
"
<EOS>
but
if
the
men
were
not
almost
equally
so
,
order
might
be
maintained
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
sorry
scene
:
I
see
fifty
selfish
brutes
at
this
moment
,
each
of
whom
,
if
I
were
near
,
I
could
conscientiously
knock
down

<EOS>
I
see
some
women
braver
than
some
men

<EOS>
There
is
one
yonder
 
Good
God
!
"
  
<EOS>
While
Graham
was
speaking
,
a
young
girl
who
had
been
very
quietly
and
steadily
clinging
to
a
gentleman
before
us
,
was
suddenly
struck
from
her
protector
's
arms
by
a
big
,
butcherly
intruder
,
and
hurled
under
the
feet
of
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
Scarce
two
seconds
lasted
her
disappearance
.
<EOS>
Graham
rushed
forwards
;
he
and
the
gentleman
,
a
powerful
man
though
grey
-
haired
,
united
their
strength
to
thrust
back
the
throng
;
her
head
and
long
hair
fell
back
over
his
shoulder
:
she
seemed
unconscious
.
  
<EOS>
"
Trust
her
with
me
;
I
am
a
medical
man
,
"
said
Dr.
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
no
lady
with
you
,
be
it
so
,
"
was
the
answer
.
<EOS>
"
Hold
her
,
and
I
will
force
a
passage
:
we
must
get
her
to
the
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
lady
,
"
said
Graham
;
"
but
she
will
be
neither
hindrance
nor
incumbrance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
summoned
me
with
his
eye
:
we
were
separated
.
<EOS>
Resolute
,
however
,
to
rejoin
him
,
I
penetrated
the
living
barrier
,
creeping
under
where
I
could
not
get
between
or
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fasten
on
me
,
and
do
n't
leave
go
,
"
he
said
;
and
I
obeyed
him
.
  
<EOS>
Our
pioneer
proved
strong
and
adroit
;
he
opened
the
dense
mass
like
a
wedge
;
with
patience
and
toil
he
at
last
bored
through
the
flesh
-
and
-
blood
rock
 
so
solid
,
hot
,
and
suffocating
 
and
brought
us
to
the
fresh
,
freezing
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
an
Englishman
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
turning
shortly
on
Dr.
Bretton
,
when
we
got
into
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
"
An
Englishman
.
<EOS>
And
I
speak
to
a
countryman
?
"
<EOS>
was
the
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Right
.
<EOS>
Be
good
enough
to
stand
here
two
minutes
,
whilst
I
find
my
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Papa
,
I
am
not
hurt
,
"
said
a
girlish
voice
;
"
am
I
with
papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
with
a
friend
,
and
your
father
is
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
I
am
not
hurt
,
except
just
in
my
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
shoulder
!
<EOS>
They
trod
just
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dislocation
,
perhaps
!
"
muttered
the
Doctor
:
"
let
us
hope
there
is
no
worse
injury
done
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
lend
a
hand
one
instant
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
I
assisted
while
he
made
some
arrangement
of
drapery
and
position
for
the
ease
of
his
suffering
burden
.
<EOS>
She
suppressed
a
moan
,
and
lay
in
his
arms
quietly
and
patiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
very
light
,
"
said
Graham
,
"
like
a
child
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
asked
in
my
ear
,
"
Is
she
a
child
,
Lucy
?
<EOS>
Did
you
notice
her
age
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
a
child
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
person
of
seventeen
,
"
responded
the
patient
,
demurely
and
with
dignity
.
<EOS>
Then
,
directly
after
:
"
Tell
papa
to
come
;
I
get
anxious
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
carriage
drove
up
;
her
father
relieved
Graham
;
but
in
the
exchange
from
one
bearer
to
another
she
was
hurt
,
and
moaned
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
darling
!
"
said
the
father
,
tenderly
;
then
turning
to
Graham
,
"
You
said
,
sir
,
you
are
a
medical
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
:
Dr.
Bretton
,
of
La
Terrasse
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Good
.
<EOS>
Will
you
step
into
my
carriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
own
carriage
is
here
:
I
will
seek
it
,
and
accompany
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Be
pleased
,
then
,
to
follow
us
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
named
his
address
:
"
The
Hôtel
Crécy
,
in
the
Rue
Crécy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
followed
;
the
carriage
drove
fast
;
myself
and
Graham
were
silent
.
<EOS>
This
seemed
like
an
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
Some
little
time
being
lost
in
seeking
our
own
equipage
,
we
reached
the
hotel
perhaps
about
ten
minutes
after
these
strangers
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
hotel
in
the
foreign
sense
:
<EOS>
a
collection
of
dwelling
-
houses
,
not
an
inn
 
a
vast
,
lofty
pile
,
with
a
huge
arch
to
its
street
-
door
,
leading
through
a
vaulted
covered
way
,
into
a
square
<EOS>
all
built
round
.
  
<EOS>
We
alighted
,
passed
up
a
wide
,
handsome
public
staircase
,
and
stopped
at
Numéro
2
on
the
second
landing
;
the
first
floor
comprising
the
abode
of
<EOS>
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
"
prince
Russe
,
"
as
Graham
informed
me
.
<EOS>
On
ringing
the
bell
at
a
second
great
door
,
we
were
admitted
to
a
suite
of
very
handsome
apartments
.
<EOS>
Announced
by
a
servant
in
livery
,
we
entered
a
drawing
-
room
whose
hearth
glowed
with
an
English
fire
,
and
whose
walls
gleamed
with
foreign
mirrors
.
<EOS>
Near
the
hearth
appeared
a
little
group
:
a
slight
form
sunk
in
a
deep
arm
-
chair
,
one
or
two
women
busy
about
it
,
the
iron
-
grey
gentleman
anxiously
looking
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Harriet
?
<EOS>
I
wish
Harriet
would
come
to
me
,
"
said
the
girlish
voice
,
faintly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Mrs.
Hurst
?
"
demanded
the
gentleman
impatiently
and
somewhat
sternly
of
the
man
-
servant
who
had
admitted
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
say
she
is
gone
out
of
town
,
sir
;
my
young
lady
gave
her
leave
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
I
did
 
<EOS>
I
did
.
<EOS>
She
is
gone
to
see
her
sister
;
I
said
she
might
go
:
<EOS>
I
remember
now
,
"
interposed
the
young
lady
;
"
but
I
am
so
sorry
,
for
Manon
and
Louison
can
not
understand
a
word
I
say
,
and
they
hurt
me
without
meaning
to
do
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
John
and
the
gentleman
now
interchanged
greetings
;
and
while
they
passed
a
few
minutes
in
consultation
,
I
approached
the
easy
-
chair
,
and
seeing
what
the
faint
and
sinking
girl
wished
to
have
done
,
I
did
it
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
still
occupied
in
the
arrangement
<EOS>
,
when
Graham
drew
near
;
he
was
no
less
skilled
in
surgery
than
medicine
,
and
,
on
examination
,
found
that
no
further
advice
than
his
own
was
necessary
to
the
treatment
of
the
present
case
.
<EOS>
He
ordered
her
to
be
carried
to
her
chamber
,
and
whispered
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
"
Go
with
the
women
,
Lucy
;
they
seem
but
dull
;
you
can
at
least
direct
their
movements
,
and
thus
spare
her
some
pain
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
touched
very
tenderly
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
chamber
was
a
room
shadowy
with
pale
-
blue
hangings
,
vaporous
with
curtainings
and
veilings
of
muslin
;
the
bed
seemed
to
me
like
snow
-
drift
and
mist
 
spotless
,
soft
,
and
gauzy
.
<EOS>
Making
the
women
stand
apart
,
I
undressed
their
mistress
,
without
their
well
-
meaning
but
clumsy
aid
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
in
a
sufficiently
collected
mood
to
note
with
separate
distinctness
every
detail
of
the
attire
I
removed
,
but
I
received
a
general
impression
of
refinement
,
delicacy
,
and
perfect
personal
cultivation
;
which
,
in
a
period
of
after
-
thought
,
offered
in
my
reflections
a
singular
contrast
to
notes
retained
of
Miss
Ginevra
Fanshawe
's
appointments
.
  
<EOS>
The
girl
was
herself
a
small
,
delicate
creature
,
but
made
like
a
model
.
<EOS>
As
I
folded
back
her
plentiful
yet
fine
hair
,
so
shining
and
soft
,
and
so
exquisitely
tended
,
I
had
under
my
observation
a
young
,
pale
,
weary
,
but
high
-
bred
face
.
<EOS>
The
brow
was
smooth
and
clear
;
the
eyebrows
were
distinct
,
but
soft
,
and
melting
to
a
mere
trace
at
the
temples
;
the
eyes
were
a
rich
gift
of
nature
 
fine
and
full
,
large
,
deep
,
seeming
to
hold
dominion
over
the
slighter
subordinate
features
 
capable
,
probably
,
of
much
significance
at
another
hour
and
under
other
circumstances
than
the
present
,
but
now
languid
and
suffering
.
<EOS>
Her
skin
was
perfectly
fair
,
the
neck
and
hands
veined
finely
like
the
petals
of
a
flower
;
a
thin
glazing
of
the
ice
of
pride
polished
this
delicate
exterior
,
and
her
lip
wore
a
curl
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
inherent
and
unconscious
,
but
which
,
if
I
had
seen
it
first
with
the
accompaniments
of
health
and
state
,
would
have
struck
me
as
unwarranted
,
and
proving
in
the
little
lady
a
quite
mistaken
view
of
life
and
her
own
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
Her
demeanour
under
the
Doctor
's
hands
at
first
excited
a
smile
;
it
was
not
puerile
 
rather
,
on
the
whole
,
patient
and
firm
 
but
yet
,
once
or
twice
<EOS>
she
addressed
him
with
suddenness
and
sharpness
,
saying
that
he
hurt
her
,
and
must
contrive
to
give
her
less
pain
;
I
saw
her
large
eyes
,
too
,
settle
on
his
face
like
the
solemn
eyes
of
some
pretty
,
wondering
child
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
Graham
felt
this
examination
:
if
he
did
,
he
was
cautious
not
to
check
or
discomfort
it
by
any
retaliatory
look
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
performed
his
work
with
extreme
care
and
gentleness
,
sparing
her
what
pain
he
could
;
and
she
acknowledged
as
much
,
when
he
had
done
,
by
the
words
:
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Doctor
,
and
good
-
night
,
"
very
gratefully
pronounced
as
she
uttered
them
,
however
,
it
was
with
a
repetition
of
the
serious
,
direct
gaze
,
I
thought
,
peculiar
in
its
gravity
and
intentness
.
  
<EOS>
The
injuries
,
it
seems
,
were
not
dangerous
:
an
assurance
which
her
father
received
with
a
smile
that
almost
made
one
<EOS>
his
friend
 
<EOS>
it
was
so
glad
and
gratified
.
<EOS>
He
now
expressed
his
obligations
to
Graham
with
as
much
earnestness
as
was
befitting
an
Englishman
addressing
one
who
has
served
him
,
but
is
yet
a
stranger
;
he
also
begged
him
to
call
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
"
said
a
voice
from
the
veiled
couch
,
"
thank
the
lady
,
too
;
is
she
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
opened
the
curtain
with
a
smile
,
and
looked
in
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
lay
now
at
comparative
ease
;
she
looked
pretty
,
though
pale
;
her
face
was
delicately
designed
,
and
<EOS>
if
at
first
sight
it
appeared
proud
,
I
believe
custom
might
prove
it
to
be
soft
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
the
lady
very
sincerely
,
"
said
her
father
:
"
I
fancy
she
has
been
very
good
to
my
child
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
scarcely
dare
tell
Mrs.
Hurst
who
has
been
her
substitute
and
done
her
work
;
she
will
feel
at
once
ashamed
and
jealous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
thus
,
in
the
most
friendly
spirit
,
parting
greetings
were
interchanged
;
and
refreshment
having
been
hospitably
offered
,
but
by
us
,
as
it
was
late
,
refused
,
we
withdrew
from
the
Hôtel
Crécy
.
  
<EOS>
On
our
way
back
we
repassed
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
All
was
silence
and
darkness
:
the
roaring
,
rushing
crowd
all
vanished
and
gone
 
the
damps
,
as
well
as
the
incipient
fire
,
extinct
and
forgotten
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
's
papers
explained
that
it
was
but
some
loose
drapery
on
which
a
spark
had
fallen
,
and
which
had
blazed
up
and
been
quenched
in
a
moment
.
    
<EOS>

<EOS>
Those
who
live
in
retirement
,
whose
lives
have
fallen
amid
the
seclusion
of
schools
or
of
other
walled
-
in
and
guarded
dwellings
,
are
liable
to
be
suddenly
and
for
a
long
while
dropped
out
of
the
memory
of
their
friends
,
the
denizens
of
a
freer
world
.
<EOS>
Unaccountably
,
perhaps
,
and
close
upon
some
space
of
unusually
frequent
intercourse
 
<EOS>
some
congeries
of
rather
exciting
little
circumstances
,
whose
natural
sequel
would
rather
seem
to
be
the
quickening
than
the
suspension
of
communication
 
there
falls
a
stilly
pause
,
a
wordless
silence
,
a
long
blank
of
oblivion
.
<EOS>
Unbroken
always
is
this
blank
;
alike
entire
and
unexplained
.
<EOS>
The
letter
,
the
message
once
frequent
,
are
cut
off
;
the
visit
,
formerly
periodical
,
ceases
to
occur
;
the
book
,
paper
,
or
other
token
that
indicated
remembrance
,
comes
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Always
there
are
excellent
reasons
for
these
lapses
,
if
the
hermit
but
knew
them
.
<EOS>
Though
he
is
stagnant
in
his
cell
,
his
connections
without
are
whirling
in
the
very
vortex
of
life
.
<EOS>
That
void
interval
which
passes
for
him
so
slowly
that
the
very
clocks
seem
at
a
stand
,
and
the
wingless
hours
plod
by
in
the
likeness
of
tired
tramps
prone
to
rest
at
milestones
 
<EOS>
that
same
interval
,
perhaps
,
teems
with
events
,
and
pants
with
hurry
for
his
friends
.
  
<EOS>
The
hermit
 
if
he
be
a
sensible
hermit
 
will
swallow
his
own
thoughts
,
and
lock
up
his
own
emotions
during
these
weeks
of
inward
winter
.
<EOS>
He
will
know
that
Destiny
designed
him
to
imitate
,
on
occasion
,
the
dormouse
,
and
he
will
be
conformable
:
make
a
tidy
ball
of
himself
,
creep
into
a
hole
of
life
's
wall
,
and
submit
decently
to
the
drift
which
blows
in
and
soon
blocks
him
up
,
preserving
him
in
ice
for
the
season
.
  
<EOS>
Let
him
say
,
"
It
is
quite
right
:
it
ought
to
be
so
,
since
so
it
is
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
perhaps
,
one
day
his
snow
-
sepulchre
will
open
,
spring
's
softness
will
return
,
the
sun
and
south
-
wind
will
reach
him
;
the
budding
of
hedges
,
and
carolling
of
birds
,
and
singing
of
liberated
streams
,
will
call
him
to
kindly
resurrection
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Perhaps
_
this
may
be
the
case
,
perhaps
not
:
the
frost
may
get
into
his
heart
and
never
thaw
more
;
when
spring
comes
,
a
crow
or
a
pie
may
pick
out
of
the
wall
only
his
dormouse
-
bones
.
<EOS>
Well
,
even
in
that
case
,
all
will
be
right
:
it
is
to
be
supposed
he
knew
from
the
first
he
was
mortal
,
and
must
one
day
go
the
way
of
all
flesh
,
"
As
well
soon
as
syne
.
"
  
<EOS>
Following
that
eventful
evening
at
the
theatre
,
came
for
me
seven
weeks
as
bare
as
seven
sheets
of
blank
paper
:
no
word
was
written
on
one
of
them
;
not
a
visit
,
not
a
token
.
  
<EOS>
About
the
middle
of
that
time
I
entertained
fancies
that
something
had
happened
to
my
friends
at
La
Terrasse
.
<EOS>
The
mid
-
blank
is
always
a
beclouded
point
for
the
solitary
:
his
nerves
ache
with
the
strain
of
long
expectancy
;
the
doubts
hitherto
repelled
gather
now
to
a
mass
and
 
strong
in
accumulation
 
roll
back
upon
him
with
a
force
which
savours
of
vindictiveness
.
<EOS>
Night
,
too
,
becomes
an
unkindly
time
,
and
sleep
and
his
nature
can
not
agree
:
strange
starts
and
struggles
harass
his
couch
:
the
sinister
band
of
bad
dreams
,
with
horror
of
calamity
,
and
sick
dread
of
entire
desertion
at
their
head
,
join
the
league
against
him
.
<EOS>
Poor
wretch
!
<EOS>
He
does
his
best
to
bear
up
,
but
he
is
a
poor
,
pallid
,
wasting
wretch
,
despite
that
best
.
  
<EOS>
Towards
the
last
of
these
long
seven
weeks
I
admitted
,
what
through
the
other
six
I
had
jealously
excluded
 
the
conviction
that
these
blanks
were
inevitable
:
the
result
of
circumstances
,
the
fiat
of
fate
,
a
part
of
my
life
's
lot
and
 
above
all
 
a
matter
about
whose
origin
no
question
must
ever
be
asked
,
for
whose
painful
sequence
no
murmur
ever
uttered
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
did
not
blame
myself
for
suffering
:
<EOS>
I
thank
God
I
had
a
truer
sense
of
justice
than
to
fall
into
any
imbecile
extravagance
of
self
-
accusation
;
and
as
to
blaming
others
for
silence
,
in
my
reason
I
well
knew
them
blameless
,
and
in
my
heart
acknowledged
them
so
:
but
it
was
a
rough
and
heavy
road
to
travel
,
and
I
longed
for
better
days
.
  
<EOS>
I
tried
different
expedients
to
sustain
and
fill
existence
:
I
commenced
an
elaborate
piece
of
lace
-
work
,
I
studied
German
pretty
hard
,
<EOS>
I
undertook
a
course
of
regular
reading
of
the
driest
and
thickest
books
in
the
library
;
in
all
my
efforts
I
was
as
orthodox
as
I
knew
how
to
be
.
<EOS>
Was
there
error
somewhere
?
<EOS>
Very
likely
.
<EOS>
I
only
know
the
result
was
as
if
I
had
gnawed
a
file
to
satisfy
hunger
,
or
drank
brine
to
quench
thirst
.
  
<EOS>
My
hour
of
torment
was
the
post
-
hour
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
,
I
knew
it
too
well
,
and
tried
as
vainly
as
assiduously
to
cheat
myself
of
that
knowledge
;
dreading
the
rack
of
expectation
,
and
the
sick
collapse
of
disappointment
which
daily
preceded
and
followed
upon
that
well
-
recognised
ring
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
animals
kept
in
cages
,
and
so
scantily
fed
as
to
be
always
upon
the
verge
of
famine
,
await
their
food
as
I
awaited
a
letter
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
to
speak
truth
,
and
drop
that
tone
of
a
false
calm
which
long
to
sustain
,
outwears
nature
's
endurance
 
<EOS>
I
underwent
in
those
seven
weeks
bitter
fears
and
pains
,
strange
inward
trials
,
miserable
defections
of
hope
,
intolerable
encroachments
of
despair
.
<EOS>
This
last
came
so
near
me
sometimes
that
her
breath
went
right
through
me
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
feel
it
like
a
baleful
air
or
sigh
,
penetrate
deep
,
and
make
motion
pause
at
my
heart
,
or
proceed
only
under
unspeakable
oppression
.
<EOS>
The
letter
 
the
well
-
beloved
letter
 
would
not
come
;
and
it
was
all
of
sweetness
in
life
I
had
to
look
for
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
very
extremity
of
want
,
I
had
recourse
again
,
and
yet
again
,
to
the
little
packet
in
the
case
 
the
five
letters
.
<EOS>
How
splendid
that
month
seemed
whose
skies
had
beheld
the
rising
of
these
five
stars
!
<EOS>
It
was
always
at
night
I
visited
them
,
and
not
daring
to
ask
every
evening
for
a
candle
in
the
kitchen
<EOS>
,
I
bought
a
wax
taper
and
matches
to
light
it
,
and
at
the
study
-
hour
stole
up
to
the
dormitory
and
feasted
on
my
crust
from
the
Barmecide
's
loaf
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
nourish
me
:
I
pined
on
it
,
and
got
as
thin
as
a
shadow
:
otherwise
I
was
not
ill
.
  
<EOS>
Reading
there
somewhat
late
one
evening
,
and
feeling
that
the
power
to
read
was
leaving
me
 
for
the
letters
from
incessant
perusal
were
losing
all
sap
and
significance
:
my
gold
was
withering
to
leaves
before
my
eyes
,
and
I
was
sorrowing
over
the
disillusion
 
<EOS>
suddenly
a
quick
tripping
foot
ran
up
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
I
knew
Ginevra
Fanshawe
's
step
:
she
had
dined
in
town
that
afternoon
;
she
was
now
returned
,
and
would
come
here
to
replace
her
shawl
,
&
c.
in
the
wardrobe
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
:
in
she
came
,
dressed
in
bright
silk
,
with
her
shawl
falling
from
her
shoulders
,
and
her
curls
,
half
-
uncurled
in
the
damp
of
night
,
drooping
careless
and
heavy
upon
her
neck
.
<EOS>
I
had
hardly
time
to
recasket
my
treasures
and
lock
them
up
when
she
was
at
my
side
<EOS>
her
humour
seemed
none
of
the
best
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
a
stupid
evening
:
they
are
stupid
people
,
"
she
began
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
?
<EOS>
I
thought
you
always
found
her
house
charming
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
been
to
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
Have
you
made
new
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
de
Bassompierre
is
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Your
uncle
de
Bassompierre
!
<EOS>
Are
you
not
glad
?
 
<EOS>
I
thought
he
was
a
favourite
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
thought
wrong
:
the
man
is
odious
;
I
hate
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
he
is
a
foreigner
?
<EOS>
or
for
what
other
reason
of
equal
weight
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
a
foreigner
.
<EOS>
The
man
is
English
enough
,
goodness
knows
;
and
had
an
English
name
till
three
or
four
years
ago
;
but
his
mother
was
a
foreigner
,
a
de
Bassompierre
,
and
some
of
her
family
are
dead
and
have
left
him
estates
,
a
title
,
and
this
name
:
he
is
quite
a
great
man
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hate
him
for
that
reason
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
I
know
what
mamma
says
about
him
?
<EOS>
He
is
not
my
own
uncle
,
but
married
mamma
's
sister
.
<EOS>
Mamma
detests
him
;
she
says
he
killed
aunt
Ginevra
with
unkindness
:
he
looks
like
a
bear
.
<EOS>
Such
a
dismal
evening
!
<EOS>
"
she
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
no
more
to
his
big
hotel
.
<EOS>
Fancy
me
walking
into
a
room
alone
,
and
a
great
man
fifty
years
old
coming
forwards
,
and
after
a
few
minutes
'
conversation
actually
turning
his
back
upon
me
,
and
then
abruptly
going
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Such
odd
ways
!
<EOS>
I
daresay
his
conscience
smote
him
,
for
they
all
say
at
home
I
am
the
picture
of
aunt
Ginevra
.
<EOS>
Mamma
often
declares
the
likeness
is
quite
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Were
you
the
only
visitor
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
only
visitor
?
<EOS>
Yes
;
then
there
was
missy
,
my
cousin
:
little
spoiled
,
pampered
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
M.
de
Bassompierre
has
a
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
:
do
n't
tease
one
with
questions
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
I
am
so
tired
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
yawned
.
<EOS>
Throwing
herself
without
ceremony
on
my
bed
she
added
,
"
It
seems
Mademoiselle
was
nearly
crushed
to
a
jelly
in
a
hubbub
at
the
theatre
some
weeks
ago
.

"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah

indeed

And
they
live

large
hotel

Rue
Crécy

Justement

"
Oh

you
have

<EOS>
Really

You
go
everywhere

days

I
suppose
Mother
Bretton
took
you
.
<EOS>
She
and
Esculapius
have
the
_
entrée
_
of
the
de
Bassompierre
apartments
:
it
seems
"
my
son
John
"
attended
missy
on
the
occasion
of
her
accident
 
Accident
?
<EOS>
Bah
!
<EOS>
All
affectation
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
she
was
squeezed
more
than
she
richly
deserves
for
her
airs
.
<EOS>
And
now
there
is
quite
an
intimacy
struck
up
:
I
heard
something
about
'
auld
lang
syne
,
"
and
what
not
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
stupid
they
all
were
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
All
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
said
you
were
the
only
visitor

<EOS>
"
  
"
Did
I
?
<EOS>
You
see
one
forgets
to
particularize
an
old
woman
and
her
boy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Bretton
were
at
M.
de
Bassompierre
's
this
evening
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ay
,
ay
!
<EOS>
as
large
as
life
;
and
missy
played
the
hostess
.
<EOS>
What
a
conceited
doll
it
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
Soured
and
listless
,
Miss
Fanshawe
was
beginning
to
disclose
the
causes
of
her
prostrate
condition
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
retrenchment
of
incense
,
a
diversion
or
a
total
withholding
of
homage
and
attention
coquetry
had
failed
of
effect
,
vanity
had
undergone
mortification
.
<EOS>
She
lay
fuming
in
the
vapours
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Miss
de
Bassompierre
quite
well
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
well
as
you
or
I
,
no
doubt
<EOS>
;
but
she
is
an
affected
little
thing
,
and
gave
herself
invalid
airs
to
attract
medical
notice
.
<EOS>
And
to
see
the
old
dowager
making
her
recline
on
a
couch
,
and
"
my
son
John
"
prohibiting
excitement
,
etcetera
 
faugh
!
<EOS>
the
scene
was
quite
sickening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
not
have
been
so
if
the
object
of
attention
had
been
changed
:
if
you
had
taken
Miss
de
Bassompierre
's
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
I
hate

my

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
"
My
son
John

"
 
<EOS>
whom
do
you
indicate
by
that
name
?
<EOS>
Dr.
Bretton

mother
never
calls
him
so

<EOS>
"
Then
she
ought

<EOS>
A
clownish
,
bearish

You
violate
the
truth

saying
so

as
the
whole
of
my
patience

now
spun
off
the
distaff

I
peremptorily
desire

rise
from

Passionate

<EOS>
John
Anderson
,
my
Joe
,
John
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
distinguished
name
!
"
  
<EOS>
Thrilling
with
exasperation
,
to
which
it
would
have
been
sheer
folly
to
have
given
vent
 
for
there
was
no
contending
with
that
unsubstantial
feather
,
that
mealy
-
winged
moth
 
<EOS>
I
extinguished
my
taper
,
locked
my
bureau
,
and
left
her
,
since
she
would
not
leave
me
.
<EOS>
Small
-
beer
as
she
was
,
she
had
turned
insufferably
acid
.
  
<EOS>
The
morrow
was
Thursday
and
a
half
-
holiday
.
<EOS>
Breakfast
was
over
;
I
had
withdrawn
to
the
first
classe
.
<EOS>
The
dreaded
hour
,
the
post
-
hour
,
was
nearing
,
and
I
sat
waiting
it
,
much
as
a
ghost
-
seer
might
wait
his
spectre
.
<EOS>
Less
than
ever
was
a
letter
probable
;
still
,
strive
as
I
would
,
I
could
not
forget
that
it
was
possible
.
<EOS>
As
the
moments
lessened
,
a
restlessness
and
fear
almost
beyond
the
average
assailed
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
day
of
winter
east
wind
,
and
I
had
now
for
some
time
entered
into
that
dreary
fellowship
with
the
winds
and
their
changes
,
so
little
known
,
so
incomprehensible
to
the
healthy
.
<EOS>
The
north
and
east
owned
a
terrific
influence
,
making
all
pain
more
poignant
,
all
sorrow
sadder
.
<EOS>
The
south
could
calm
,
the
west
sometimes
cheer
:
unless
,
indeed
,
they
brought
on
their
wings
the
burden
of
thunder
-
clouds
,
under
the
weight
and
warmth
of
which
all
energy
died
.
  
<EOS>
Bitter
and
dark
as
was
this
January
day
<EOS>
,
I
remember
leaving
the
classe
,
and
running
down
without
bonnet
to
the
bottom
of
the
long
garden
,
and
then
lingering
amongst
the
stripped
shrubs
,
in
the
forlorn
hope
that
the
postman
's
ring
might
occur
while
I
was
out
of
hearing
,
and
I
might
thus
be
spared
the
thrill
which
some
particular
nerve
or
nerves
,
almost
gnawed
through
with
the
unremitting
tooth
of
a
fixed
idea
,
were
becoming
wholly
unfit
to
support
.
<EOS>
I
lingered
as
long
as
I
dared
without
fear
of
attracting
attention
by
my
absence
.
<EOS>
I
muffled
my
head
in
my
apron
,
and
stopped
my
ears
in
terror
of
the
torturing
clang
,
sure
to
be
followed
by
such
blank
silence
,
such
barren
vacuum
for
me
.
<EOS>
At
last
I
ventured
to
re
-
enter
the
first
classe
,
where
,
as
it
was
not
yet
nine
o'clock
,
no
pupils
had
been
admitted
.
<EOS>
The
first
thing
seen
was
a
white
object
on
my
black
desk
,
a
white
,
flat
object
.
<EOS>
The
post
had
,
indeed
,
arrived
;
by
me
unheard
.
<EOS>
Rosine
had
visited
my
cell
,
and
,
like
some
angel
,
had
left
behind
her
a
bright
token
of
her
presence
.
<EOS>
That
shining
thing
on
the
desk
was
indeed
a
letter
,
a
real
letter
;
I
saw
so
much
at
the
distance
of
three
yards
,
and
as
I
had
but
one
correspondent
on
earth
,
from
that
one
it
must
come
.
<EOS>
He
remembered
me
yet
.
<EOS>
How
deep
a
pulse
of
gratitude
sent
new
life
through
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Drawing
near
,
bending
and
looking
on
the
letter
,
in
trembling
but
almost
certain
hope
of
seeing
a
known
hand
,
it
was
my
lot
to
find
,
on
the
contrary
,
an
autograph
for
the
moment
deemed
unknown
 
a
pale
female
scrawl
,
instead
of
a
firm
,
masculine
character
.
<EOS>
I
then
thought
fate
was
_
too
<EOS>
_
hard
for
me
,
<EOS>
and
I
said
,
audibly
,
"
This
is
cruel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
I
got
over
that
pain
also
.
<EOS>
Life
is
still
life
,
whatever
its
pangs
:
<EOS>
our
eyes
and
ears
and
their
use
remain
with
us
,
though
the
prospect
of
what
pleases
be
wholly
withdrawn
,
and
the
sound
of
what
consoles
be
quite
silenced
.
  
<EOS>
I
opened
the
billet
:
by
this
time
I
had
recognised
its
handwriting
as
perfectly
familiar
.
<EOS>
It
was
dated
"
La
Terrasse
,
"
and
it
ran
thus
:
    
"
DEAR
LUCY
,
 
<EOS>
It
occurs
to
me
to
inquire
what
you
have
been
doing
with
yourself
for
the
last
month
or
two
?
<EOS>
Not
that
I
suspect
you
would
have
the
least
difficulty
in
giving
an
account
of
your
proceedings
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
you
have
been
just
as
busy
and
as
happy
as
ourselves
at
La
Terrasse
.
<EOS>
As
to
Graham
,
his
professional
connection
extends
daily
:
he
is
so
much
sought
after
,
so
much
engaged
,
that
I
tell
him
he
will
grow
quite
conceited
.
<EOS>
Like
a
right
good
mother
,
as
I
am
,
I
do
my
best
to
keep
him
down
:
<EOS>
no
flattery
<EOS>
does
he
get
from
me
,
as
you
know
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
Lucy
,
he
is
a
fine
fellow
:
<EOS>
his
mother
's
heart
dances
at
the
sight
of
him
.
<EOS>
After
being
hurried
here
and
there
the
whole
day
,
and
passing
the
ordeal
of
fifty
sorts
of
tempers
,
and
combating
a
hundred
caprices
,
and
sometimes
witnessing
cruel
sufferings
 
perhaps
,
occasionally
,
as
I
tell
him
,
inflicting
them
 
at
night
he
still
comes
home
to
me
in
such
kindly
,
pleasant
mood
,
that
really
,
I
seem
to
live
in
a
sort
of
moral
antipodes
,
and
on
these
January
evenings
my
day
rises
when
other
people
's
night
sets
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Still
he
needs
keeping
in
order
,
and
correcting
,
and
repressing
,
and
I
do
him
that
good
service
;
but
the
boy
is
so
elastic
there
is
no
such
thing
as
vexing
him
thoroughly
.
<EOS>
When
I
think
I
have
at
last
driven
him
to
the
sullens
,
he
turns
on
me
with
jokes
for
retaliation
:
but
you
know
him
and
all
his
iniquities
,
and
I
am
but
an
elderly
simpleton
to
make
him
the
subject
of
this
epistle
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
for
me
,
I
have
had
my
old
Bretton
agent
here
on
a
visit
,
and
have
been
plunged
overhead
and
ears
in
business
matters
.
<EOS>
I
do
so
wish
to
regain
for
Graham
at
least
some
part
of
what
his
father
left
him
.
<EOS>
He
laughs
to
scorn
my
anxiety
on
this
point
,
bidding
me
look
and
see
how
he
can
provide
for
himself
and
me
too
,
and
asking
what
the
old
lady
can
possibly
want
that
she
has
not
;
hinting
about
sky
-
blue
turbans
;
accusing
me
of
an
ambition
to
wear
diamonds
,
keep
livery
servants
,
have
an
hotel
,
and
lead
the
fashion
amongst
the
English
clan
in
Villette
.
  
<EOS>
"
Talking
of
sky
-
blue
turbans
,
I
wish
you
had
been
with
us
the
other
evening
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
in
really
tired
,
and
after
I
had
given
him
his
tea
,
he
threw
himself
into
my
chair
with
his
customary
presumption
.
<EOS>
To
my
great
delight
,
he
dropped
asleep
.
<EOS>
(
You
know
how
he
teases
me
about
being
drowsy
;
<EOS>
I
,
who
never
,
by
any
chance
,
close
an
eye
by
daylight
.
)
<EOS>
While
he
slept
,
I
thought
he
looked
very
bonny
,
Lucy
:
<EOS>
fool
as
I
am
to
be
so
proud
of
him
;
but
who
can
help
it
?
<EOS>
Show
me
his
peer
.
<EOS>
Look
where
I
will
,
I
see
nothing
like
him
in
Villette
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
took
it
into
my
head
to
play
him
a
trick
:
so
I
brought
out
the
sky
-
blue
turban
,
and
handling
it
with
gingerly
precaution
,
I
managed
to
invest
his
brows
with
this
grand
adornment
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
it
did
not
at
all
misbecome
him
;
he
looked
quite
Eastern
,
except
that
he
is
so
fair
.
<EOS>
Nobody
,
however
,
can
accuse
him
of
having
red
hair
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
now
_
 
<EOS>
it
is
genuine
chestnut
 
a
dark
,
glossy
chestnut
;
and
when
I
put
my
large
cashmere
about
him
,
there
was
as
fine
<EOS>
a
young
bey
,
dey
,
or
pacha
improvised
as
you
would
wish
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
good
entertainment
;
but
only
half
-
enjoyed
,
since
I
was
alone
:
you
should
have
been
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
due
time
my
lord
awoke
:
<EOS>
the
looking
-
glass
above
the
fireplace
soon
intimated
to
him
his
plight
:
as
you
may
imagine
,
I
now
live
under
threat
and
dread
of
vengeance
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
to
come
to
the
gist
of
my
letter
.
<EOS>
I
know
Thursday
is
a
half
-
holiday
in
the
Rue
Fossette
:
be
ready
,
then
,
by
five
in
the
afternoon
,
at
which
hour
I
will
send
the
carriage
to
take
you
out
to
La
Terrasse
.
<EOS>
Be
sure
to
come
:
you
may
meet
some
old
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Good
-
by
,
my
wise
,
dear
,
grave
little
god
-
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Very
truly
yours
,
  
"
LOUISA
BRETTON
.
"
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
a
letter
like
that
sets
one
to
rights
!
<EOS>
I
might
still
be
sad
after
reading
that
letter
,
but
I
was
more
composed
<EOS>
;
not
exactly
cheered
,
perhaps
,
but
relieved
.
<EOS>
My
friends
,
at
least
,
were
well
and
happy
<EOS>
:
no
accident
had
occurred
to
Graham
;
no
illness
had
seized
his
mother
-
calamities
that
had
so
long
been
my
dream
and
thought
.
<EOS>
Their
feelings
for
me
too
were
 
as
they
had
been
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
how
strange
it
was
to
look
on
Mrs.
Bretton
's
seven
weeks
and
contrast
them
with
my
seven
weeks
!
<EOS>
Also
,
how
very
wise
it
is
in
people
placed
in
an
exceptional
position
to
hold
their
tongues
and
not
rashly
declare
how
such
position
galls
them
!
<EOS>
The
world
can
understand
well
enough
the
process
of
perishing
for
want
of
food
:
perhaps
few
persons
can
enter
into
or
follow
out
that
of
going
mad
from
solitary
confinement
.
<EOS>
They
see
the
long
-
buried
prisoner
disinterred
,
a
maniac
or
an
idiot
!
 
<EOS>
how
his
senses
left
him
 
how
his
nerves
,
first
inflamed
,
underwent
nameless
agony
,
and
then
sunk
to
palsy
 
is
a
subject
too
intricate
for
examination
,
too
abstract
for
popular
comprehension
.
<EOS>
Speak
of
it
!
<EOS>
you
might
almost
as
well
stand
up
in
an
European
market
-
place
,
and
propound
dark
sayings
in
that
language
and
mood
wherein
Nebuchadnezzar
,
the
imperial
hypochondriac
,
communed
with
his
baffled
Chaldeans
.
<EOS>
And
long
,
long
may
the
minds
to
whom
such
themes
are
no
mystery
 
by
whom
their
bearings
are
sympathetically
seized
 
be
few
in
number
,
and
rare
of
rencounter
.
<EOS>
Long
may
it
be
generally
thought
that
physical
privations
alone
merit
compassion
,
and
that
the
rest
is
a
figment
.
<EOS>
When
the
world
was
younger
and
haler
than
now
,
moral
trials
were
a
deeper
mystery
still
:
perhaps
in
all
the
land
of
Israel
there
was
but
one
Saul
 
certainly
but
one
David
to
soothe
or
comprehend
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
keen
,
still
cold
of
the
morning
was
succeeded
,
later
in
the
day
,
by
a
sharp
breathing
from
Russian
wastes
:
the
cold
zone
sighed
over
the
temperate
zone
,
and
froze
it
fast
.
<EOS>
A
heavy
firmament
,
dull
,
and
thick
with
snow
,
sailed
up
from
the
north
,
and
settled
over
expectant
Europe
.
<EOS>
Towards
afternoon
began
the
descent
.
<EOS>
I
feared
no
carriage
would
come
,
the
white
tempest
raged
so
dense
and
wild
.
<EOS>
But
trust
my
godmother
!
<EOS>
Once
having
asked
,
she
would
have
her
guest
.
<EOS>
About
six
o'clock
I
was
lifted
from
the
carriage
over
the
already
blocked
-
up
front
steps
of
the
château
,
and
put
in
at
the
door
of
La
Terrasse
.
  
<EOS>
Running
through
the
vestibule
,
and
up
-
stairs
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
there
I
found
Mrs.
Bretton
 
<EOS>
a
summer
-
day
in
her
own
person
.
<EOS>
Had
I
been
twice
as
cold
as
I
was
,
her
kind
kiss
and
cordial
clasp
would
have
warmed
me
.
<EOS>
Inured
now
for
so
long
a
time
to
rooms
with
bare
boards
,
black
benches
,
desks
,
and
stoves
,
the
blue
saloon
seemed
to
me
gorgeous
.
<EOS>
In
its
Christmas
-
like
fire
alone
there
was
a
clear
and
crimson
splendour
which
quite
dazzled
me
.
  
<EOS>
When
my
godmother
had
held
my
hand
for
a
little
while
,
and
chatted
with
me
,
and
scolded
me
for
having
become
thinner
than
when
she
last
saw
me
,
she
professed
to
discover
that
the
snow
-
wind
had
disordered
my
hair
,
and
sent
me
up
-
stairs
to
make
it
neat
and
remove
my
shawl
.
  
<EOS>
Repairing
to
my
own
little
sea
-
green
room
,
there
also
I
found
a
bright
fire
,
and
candles
too
were
lit
:
a
tall
waxlight
stood
on
each
side
the
great
looking
glass
;
but
between
the
candles
,
and
before
the
glass
,
appeared
something
dressing
itself
 
an
airy
,
fairy
thing
 
small
,
slight
,
white
 
a
winter
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
I
declare
,
for
one
moment
I
thought
of
Graham
and
his
spectral
illusions
.
<EOS>
With
distrustful
eye
I
noted
the
details
of
this
new
vision
.
<EOS>
It
wore
white
,
sprinkled
slightly
with
drops
of
scarlet
;
its
girdle
was
red
;
it
had
something
in
its
hair
leafy
,
yet
shining
 
a
little
wreath
with
an
evergreen
gloss
.
<EOS>
Spectral
or
not
,
here
truly
was
nothing
frightful
,
and
I
advanced
.
  
<EOS>
Turning
quick
upon
me
,
a
large
eye
,
under
long
lashes
,
flashed
over
me
,
the
intruder
:
the
lashes
were
as
dark
as
long
,
and
they
softened
with
their
pencilling
the
orb
they
guarded
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
are
come
!
"
<EOS>
she
breathed
out
,
in
a
soft
,
quiet
voice
,
and
she
smiled
slowly
,
and
gazed
intently
.
  
<EOS>
I
knew
her
now
.
<EOS>
Having
only
once
seen
that
sort
of
face
,
with
that
cast
of
fine
and
delicate
featuring
,
I
could
not
but
know
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
de
Bassompierre
,
"
I
pronounced
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
was
the
reply
,
"
not
Miss
de
Bassompierre
for
_
you
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
inquire
who
then
she
might
be
,
but
waited
voluntary
information
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
changed
,
but
still
you
are
yourself
,
"
she
said
,
approaching
nearer
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
you
well
 
your
countenance
,
the
colour
of
your
hair
,
the
outline
of
your
face
....
"
  
I
had
moved
to
the
fire
,
and
she
stood
opposite
,
and
gazed
into
me
;
and
as
she
gazed
,
her
face
became
gradually
more
and
more
expressive
of
thought
and
feeling
,
till
at
last
a
dimness
quenched
her
clear
vision
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
makes
me
almost
cry
to
look
so
far
back
,
"
said
she
:
"
<EOS>
but
as
to
being
sorry
,
or
sentimental
,
do
n't
think
it
:
on
the
contrary
,
I
am
quite
pleased
and
glad
.
"
  
<EOS>
Interested
,
yet
altogether
at
fault
,
I
knew
not
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
At
last
I
stammered
,
"
I
think
I
never
met
you
till
that
night
,
some
weeks
ago
,
when
you
were
hurt
...
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
smiled
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
forgotten
then
that
I
have
sat
on
your
knee
,
been
lifted
in
your
arms
,
even
shared
your
pillow
?
<EOS>
You
no
longer
remember
the
night
when
I
came
crying
,
like
a
naughty
little
child
as
I
was
,
to
your
bedside
,
and
you
took
me
in
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
memory
for
the
comfort
and
protection
by
which
you
soothed
an
acute
distress
?
<EOS>
Go
back
to
Bretton
.
<EOS>
Remember
Mr.
Home
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
last
I
saw
it
all
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
are
little
Polly
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
Paulina
Mary
Home
de
Bassompierre
.
"
  
<EOS>
How
time
can
change
!
<EOS>
Little
Polly
wore
in
her
pale
,
small
features
,
her
fairy
symmetry
,
her
varying
expression
,
a
certain
promise
of
interest
and
grace
;
but
Paulina
Mary
was
become
beautiful
 
not
with
the
beauty
that
strikes
the
eye
like
a
rose
 
orbed
,
ruddy
,
and
replete
;
not
with
the
plump
,
and
pink
,
and
flaxen
attributes
of
her
blond
cousin
Ginevra
;
but
her
seventeen
years
had
brought
her
a
refined
and
tender
charm
which
did
not
lie
in
complexion
,
though
hers
was
fair
and
clear
;
nor
in
outline
,
though
her
features
were
sweet
,
and
her
limbs
perfectly
turned
;
but
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
rather
in
a
subdued
glow
from
the
soul
outward
.
<EOS>
This
was
not
an
opaque
vase
,
of
material
however
costly
,
but
a
lamp
chastely
lucent
,
guarding
from
extinction
,
yet
not
hiding
from
worship
,
a
flame
vital
and
vestal
.
<EOS>
In
speaking
of
her
attractions
,
I
would
not
exaggerate
language
;
but
,
indeed
,
they
seemed
to
me
very
real
and
engaging
.
<EOS>
What
though
all
was
on
a
small
scale
,
it
was
the
perfume
which
gave
this
white
violet
distinction
,
and
made
it
superior
to
the
broadest
camelia
 
the
fullest
dahlia
that
ever
bloomed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
and
you
remember
the
old
time
at
Bretton
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Better
,
"
said
she
,
"
better
,
perhaps
,
than
you
.
<EOS>
I
remember
it
with
minute
distinctness
:
not
only
the
time
,
but
the
days
of
the
time
,
and
the
hours
of
the
days
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
forgotten
some
things
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
little
,
I
imagine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
then
a
little
creature
of
quick
feelings
:
you
must
,
long
ere
this
,
have
outgrown
the
impressions
with
which
joy
and
grief
,
affection
and
bereavement
,
stamped
your
mind
ten
years
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
I
have
forgotten
whom
I
liked
,
and
in
what
degree
I
liked
them
when
a
child
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
sharpness
must
be
gone
 
the
point
,
the
poignancy
 
<EOS>
the
deep
imprint
must
be
softened
away
and
effaced
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
good
memory
for
those
days
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
as
if
she
had
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
one
who
can
remember
;
one
whose
childhood
does
not
fade
like
a
dream
,
nor
whose
youth
vanish
like
a
sunbeam
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
take
life
,
loosely
and
incoherently
,
in
parts
,
and
let
one
season
slip
as
she
entered
on
another
:
she
would
retain
and
add
;
often
review
from
the
commencement
,
and
so
grow
in
harmony
and
consistency
as
she
grew
in
years
.
<EOS>
Still
I
could
not
quite
admit
the
conviction
that
_
<EOS>
all
_
<EOS>
the
pictures
which
now
crowded
upon
me
were
vivid
and
visible
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
fond
attachments
,
her
sports
and
contests
with
a
well
-
loved
playmate
,
the
patient
,
true
devotion
of
her
child
's
heart
,
her
fears
,
her
delicate
reserves
,
her
little
trials
,
the
last
piercing
pain
of
separation
....
<EOS>
I
retraced
these
things
,
and
shook
my
head
incredulous
.
<EOS>
She
persisted
.
<EOS>
"
The
child
of
seven
years
lives
yet
in
the
girl
of
seventeen
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
used
to
be
excessively
fond
of
Mrs.
Bretton
,
"
I
remarked
,
intending
to
test
her
.
<EOS>
She
set
me
right
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
_
excessively
_
fond
,
"
said
she
;
"
I
liked
her
:
<EOS>
I
respected
her
as
I
should
do
now
:
she
seems
to
me
very
little
altered
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
much
changed
,
"
I
assented
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
silent
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
Glancing
round
the
room
she
said
,
"
There
are
several
things
here
that
used
to
be
at
Bretton
!
<EOS>
I
remember
that
pincushion
and
that
looking
-
glass
.
"
  
<EOS>
Evidently
she
was
not
deceived
in
her
estimate
of
her
own
memory
;
not
,
at
least
,
so
far
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
,
then
,
you
would
have
known
Mrs.
Bretton
?
<EOS>
"
I
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
perfectly
remembered
her
;
the
turn
of
her
features
,
her
olive
complexion
,
and
black
hair
,
her
height
,
her
walk
,
her
voice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dr.
Bretton
,
of
course
,
"
I
pursued
,
"
would
be
out
of
the
question
:
and
,
indeed
,
as
I
saw
your
first
interview
with
him
,
I
am
aware
that
he
appeared
to
you
as
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
first
night
I
was
puzzled
,
"
she
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
did
the
recognition
between
him
and
your
father
come
about
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
exchanged
cards
.
<EOS>
The
names
Graham
Bretton
and
Home
de
Bassompierre
gave
rise
to
questions
and
explanations
.
<EOS>
That
was
on
the
second
day
;
but
before
then
I
was
beginning
to
know
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
 
know
something
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
she
said
,
"
how
strange
it
is
that
most
people
seem
so
slow
to
feel
the
truth
 
not
to
see
,
but
_
feel
_
!
<EOS>
When
Dr.
Bretton
had
visited
me
a
few
times
,
and
sat
near
and
talked
to
me
;
when
I
had
observed
the
look
in
his
eyes
,
the
expression
about
his
mouth
,
the
form
of
his
chin
,
the
carriage
of
his
head
,
and
all
that
we
_
do
_
observe
in
persons
who
approach
us
 
how
could
I
avoid
being
led
by
association
to
think
of
Graham
Bretton
?
<EOS>
Graham
was
slighter
than
he
,
and
not
grown
so
tall
,
and
had
a
smoother
face
,
and
longer
and
lighter
hair
,
and
spoke
 
not
so
deeply
 
more
like
a
girl
;
but
yet
_
he
_
is
Graham
,
just
as
_
I
_
am
little
Polly
,
or
you
are
Lucy
Snowe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
the
same
,
but
I
wondered
to
find
my
thoughts
hers
:
there
are
certain
things
in
which
we
so
rarely
meet
with
our
double
that
it
seems
a
miracle
when
that
chance
befalls
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
and
Graham
were
once
playmates
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
remember
that
?
"
<EOS>
she
questioned
in
her
turn
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
he
will
remember
it
also
,
"
said
I.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
asked
him
:
few
things
would
surprise
me
so
much
as
to
find
that
he
did
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
his
disposition
is
still
gay
and
careless
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
so
formerly
?
<EOS>
Did
it
so
strike
you
?
<EOS>
Do
you
thus
remember
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
scarcely
remember
him
in
any
other
light
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
was
studious
;
sometimes
he
was
merry
:
but
whether
busy
with
his
books
or
disposed
for
play
,
it
was
chiefly
the
books
or
game
he
thought
of
;
not
much
heeding
those
with
whom
he
read
or
amused
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
to
you
he
was
partial
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Partial
to
me
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
he
had
other
playmates
 
<EOS>
his
school
-
fellows
;
I
was
of
little
consequence
to
him
,
except
on
Sundays
:
<EOS>
yes
,
he
was
kind
on
Sundays
.
<EOS>
I
remember
walking
with
him
hand
-
in
-
hand
to
St.
Mary
's
,
and
his
finding
the
places
in
my
prayer
-
book
;
and
how
good
and
still
he
was
on
Sunday
evenings
!
<EOS>
So
mild
for
such
a
proud
,
lively
boy
;
so
patient
with
all
my
blunders
in
reading
;
and
so
wonderfully
to
be
depended
on
,
for
he
never
spent
those
evenings
from
home
:
I
had
a
constant
fear
that
he
would
accept
some
invitation
and
forsake
us
;
but
he
never
did
,
nor
seemed
ever
to
wish
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
of
course
,
it
can
be
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Sunday
will
now
be
Dr.
Bretton
's
dining
-
out
day
....
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Children
,
come
down
!
"
<EOS>
here
called
Mrs.
Bretton
from
below
.
<EOS>
Paulina
would
still
have
lingered
,
but
I
inclined
to
descend
:
we
went
down
.
    
<EOS>
THE
LITTLE
COUNTESS
.
  
<EOS>
Cheerful
as
my
godmother
naturally
was
,
and
entertaining
as
,
for
our
sakes
<EOS>
,
she
made
a
point
of
being
,
there
was
no
true
enjoyment
that
evening
at
La
Terrasse
,
till
,
through
the
wild
howl
of
the
winter
-
night
,
were
heard
the
signal
sounds
of
arrival
.
<EOS>
How
often
,
while
women
and
girls
sit
warm
at
snug
fire
-
sides
,
their
hearts
and
imaginations
are
doomed
to
divorce
from
the
comfort
surrounding
their
persons
,
forced
out
by
night
to
wander
through
dark
ways
,
to
dare
stress
of
weather
,
to
contend
with
the
snow
-
blast
,
to
wait
at
lonely
gates
and
stiles
in
wildest
storms
,
watching
and
listening
to
see
and
hear
the
father
,
the
son
,
the
husband
coming
home
.
  
<EOS>
Father
and
son
came
at
last
to
the
château
:
for
the
Count
de
Bassompierre
that
night
accompanied
Dr.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
which
of
our
trio
heard
the
horses
first
;
the
asperity
,
the
violence
of
the
weather
warranted
our
running
down
into
the
hall
to
meet
and
greet
the
two
riders
as
they
came
in
;
but
they
warned
us
to
keep
our
distance
:
both
were
white
 
two
mountains
of
snow
;
and
indeed
Mrs.
Bretton
,
seeing
their
condition
,
ordered
them
instantly
to
the
kitchen
;
prohibiting
them
,
at
their
peril
,
from
setting
foot
on
her
carpeted
staircase
till
they
had
severally
put
off
that
mask
of
Old
Christmas
they
now
affected
.
<EOS>
Into
the
kitchen
,
however
,
we
could
not
help
following
them
:
it
was
a
large
old
Dutch
kitchen
,
picturesque
and
pleasant
.
<EOS>
The
little
white
Countess
danced
in
a
circle
about
her
equally
white
sire
,
clapping
her
hands
and
crying
,
"
Papa
,
papa
<EOS>
,
you
look
like
an
enormous
Polar
bear
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
bear
shook
himself
,
and
the
little
sprite
fled
far
from
the
frozen
shower
.
<EOS>
Back
she
came
,
however
,
laughing
,
and
eager
to
aid
in
removing
the
arctic
disguise
.
<EOS>
The
Count
,
at
last
issuing
from
his
dreadnought
,
threatened
to
overwhelm
her
with
it
as
with
an
avalanche
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
then
,
"
said
she
,
bending
to
invite
the
fall
,
and
when
it
was
playfully
advanced
above
her
head
,
bounding
out
of
reach
like
some
little
chamois
.
  
<EOS>
Her
movements
had
the
supple
softness
,
the
velvet
grace
of
a
kitten
;
her
laugh
was
clearer
than
the
ring
of
silver
and
crystal
;
as
she
took
her
sire
's
cold
hands
and
rubbed
them
,
and
stood
on
tiptoe
to
reach
his
lips
for
a
kiss
,
there
seemed
to
shine
round
her
a
halo
of
loving
delight
.
<EOS>
The
grave
and
reverend
seignor
looked
down
on
her
as
men
_
<EOS>
do
_
look
on
what
is
the
apple
of
their
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Bretton
,
"
said
he
:
"
<EOS>
what
am
I
to
do
with
this
daughter
or
daughterling
of
mine
?
<EOS>
She
neither
grows
in
wisdom
nor
in
stature
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
find
her
pretty
nearly
as
much
<EOS>
the
child
as
she
was
ten
years
ago
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
can
not
be
more
the
child
than
this
great
boy
of
mine
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bretton
,
who
was
in
conflict
with
her
son
about
some
change
of
dress
she
deemed
advisable
,
and
which
he
resisted
.
<EOS>
He
stood
leaning
against
the
Dutch
dresser
,
laughing
and
keeping
her
at
arm
's
length
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
mamma
,
"
said
he
,
"
by
way
of
compromise
,
and
to
secure
for
us
inward
as
well
as
outward
warmth
,
let
us
have
a
Christmas
wassail
-
cup
,
and
toast
Old
England
here
,
on
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
,
while
the
Count
stood
by
the
fire
,
and
Paulina
Mary
still
danced
to
and
fro
 
happy
in
the
liberty
of
the
wide
hall
-
like
kitchen
 
Mrs.
Bretton
herself
instructed
Martha
to
spice
and
heat
the
wassail
-
bowl
,
and
,
pouring
the
draught
into
a
Bretton
flagon
,
it
was
served
round
,
reaming
hot
,
by
means
of
a
small
silver
vessel
,
which
I
recognised
as
Graham
's
christening
-
cup
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
to
Auld
Lang
Syne
!
"
said
the
Count
;
holding
the
glancing
cup
on
high
.
<EOS>
Then
,
looking
at
Mrs.
Bretton
.
    
<EOS>
"
We

"
  
<EOS>
"
Scotch

<EOS>
Scotch

"
<EOS>
cried
Paulina
;
"
papa
is
talking
Scotch
;
and
Scotch
he
is
,
partly
.
<EOS>
We
are
Home
and
de
Bassompierre
,
Caledonian
and
Gallic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
is
that
a
Scotch
reel
you
are
dancing
,
you
Highland
fairy
?
"
asked
her
father
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
,
there
will
be
a
green
ring
growing
up
in
the
middle
of
your
kitchen
shortly
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
answer
for
her
being
quite
cannie
:
she
is
a
strange
little
mortal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
Lucy
to
dance
with
me
,
papa
;
there
is
Lucy
Snowe
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Home
(
there
was
still
quite
as
much
about
him
of
plain
Mr.
Home
as
of
proud
Count
de
Bassompierre
)
held
his
hand
out
to
me
,
saying
kindly
,
"
he
remembered
me
well
;
and
,
even
had
his
own
memory
been
less
trustworthy
,
my
name
was
so
often
on
his
daughter
's
lips
,
and
he
had
listened
to
so
many
long
tales
about
me
,
I
should
seem
like
an
old
acquaintance
.
"
  
<EOS>
Every
one
now
had
tasted
the
wassail
-
cup
except
Paulina
,
whose
pas
de
fée
,
ou
de
fantaisie
,
nobody
thought
of
interrupting
to
offer
so
profanatory
a
draught
;
but
she
was
not
to
be
overlooked
,
nor
baulked
of
her
mortal
privileges
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
taste
,
"
said
she
to
Graham
,
as
he
was
putting
the
cup
on
the
shelf
of
the
dresser
out
of
her
reach
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
and
Mr.
Home
were
now
engaged
in
conversation
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
had
not
been
unobservant
of
the
fairy
's
dance
;
he
had
watched
it
,
and
he
had
liked
it
.
<EOS>
To
say
nothing
of
the
softness
and
beauty
of
the
movements
,
eminently
grateful
to
his
grace
-
loving
eye
,
that
ease
in
his
mother
's
house
charmed
him
,
for
it
set
_
him
_
at
ease
:
again
she
seemed
a
child
for
him
 
again
,
almost
his
playmate
.
<EOS>
I
wondered
how
he
would
speak
to
her
;
I
had
not
yet
seen
him
address
her
;
his
first
words
proved
that
the
old
days
of
"
little
Polly
"
had
been
recalled
to
his
mind
by
this
evening
's
child
-
like
light
-
heartedness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
wishes
for
the
tankard
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
said
so
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
intimated
as
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Could
n't
consent
to
a
step
of
the
kind
on
any
account
.
<EOS>
Sorry
for
it
,
but
could
n't
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
I
am
quite
well
now
<EOS>
:
it
ca
n't
break
my
collar
-
bone
again
,
or
dislocate
my
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Is
it
wine
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
nor
dew
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
dew
;
I
do
n't
like
dew
:
but
what
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ale
 
strong
ale
 
old
October
;
brewed
,
perhaps
,
when
I
was
born
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
curious
:
is
it
good
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Excessively
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
he
took
it
down
,
administered
to
himself
a
second
dose
of
this
mighty
elixir
,
<EOS>
expressed
in
his
mischievous
eyes
extreme
contentment
with
the
same
,
and
solemnly
replaced
the
cup
on
the
shelf
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
a
little
,
"
said
Paulina
,
<EOS>
looking
up
;
"
I
never
had
any
"
old
October
:
"
is
it
sweet
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Perilously
sweet
,
"
said
Graham
.
  
<EOS>
She
continued
to
look
up
exactly
with
the
countenance
of
a
child
that
longs
for
some
prohibited
dainty
.
<EOS>
At
last
the
Doctor
relented
,
took
it
down
,
and
indulged
himself
in
the
gratification
of
letting
her
taste
from
his
hand
;
his
eyes
,
always
expressive
in
the
revelation
of
pleasurable
feelings
,
luminously
and
smilingly
avowed
that
it
_
was
_
a
gratification
;
and
he
prolonged
it
by
so
regulating
the
position
of
the
cup
that
only
a
drop
at
a
time
could
reach
the
rosy
,
sipping
lips
by
which
its
brim
was
courted
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
little
more
 
<EOS>
a
little
more
,
"
said
she
,
petulantly
touching
his
hand
with
the
forefinger
,
to
make
him
incline
the
cup
more
generously
and
yieldingly
.
<EOS>
"
It
smells
of
spice
and
sugar
,
but
I
ca
n't
taste
it
;
your
wrist
is
so
stiff
,
and
you
are
so
stingy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
indulged
her
,
whispering
,
however
,
with
gravity
:
"
Do
n't
tell
my
mother
or
Lucy
;
they
would
n't
approve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
do
I
,
"
said
she
,
passing
into
another
tone
and
manner
as
soon
as
she
had
fairly
assayed
the
beverage
,
just
as
if
it
had
acted
upon
her
like
some
disenchanting
draught
,
undoing
the
work
of
a
wizard
<EOS>
:
"
I
find
it
anything
but
sweet
;
it
is
bitter
and
hot
,
and
takes
away
my
breath
.
<EOS>
Your
old
October
was
only
desirable
while
forbidden
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
,
with
a
slight
bend
 
careless
,
but
as
graceful
as
her
dance
 
<EOS>
she
glided
from
him
and
rejoined
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
she
had
spoken
truth
:
the
child
of
seven
was
in
the
girl
of
seventeen
.
  
<EOS>
Graham
looked
after
her
a
little
baffled
,
a
little
puzzled
;
his
eye
was
on
her
a
good
deal
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
,
but
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
him
.
  
<EOS>
As
we
ascended
to
the
drawing
-
room
for
tea
,
she
took
her
father
's
arm
:
her
natural
place
seemed
to
be
at
his
side
;
her
eyes
and
her
ears
were
dedicated
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
and
Mrs.
Bretton
were
the
chief
talkers
of
our
little
party
,
and
Paulina
was
their
best
listener
,
attending
closely
to
all
that
was
said
,
prompting
the
repetition
of
this
or
that
trait
or
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
were
you
at
such
a
time
,
papa
?
<EOS>
And
what
did
you
say
then
?
<EOS>
And
tell
Mrs.
Bretton
what
happened
on
that
occasion
.
"
<EOS>
Thus
she
drew
him
out
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
again
yield
to
any
effervescence
of
glee
;
the
infantine
sparkle
was
exhaled
for
the
night
:
she
was
soft
,
thoughtful
,
and
docile
.
<EOS>
It
was
pretty
to
see
her
bid
good
-
night
;
her
manner
to
Graham
was
touched
with
dignity
:
in
her
very
slight
smile
and
quiet
bow
spoke
the
Countess
,
and
Graham
could
not
but
look
grave
,
and
bend
responsive
.
<EOS>
I
saw
he
hardly
knew
how
to
blend
together
in
his
ideas
the
dancing
fairy
and
delicate
dame
.
  
<EOS>
Next
day
,
when
we
were
all
assembled
round
the
breakfast
-
table
,
shivering
and
fresh
from
the
morning
's
chill
ablutions
,
Mrs.
Bretton
pronounced
a
decree
that
nobody
,
who
was
not
forced
by
dire
necessity
,
should
quit
her
house
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
egress
seemed
next
to
impossible
;
the
drift
darkened
the
lower
panes
of
the
casement
,
and
,
on
looking
out
,
one
saw
the
sky
and
air
vexed
and
dim
,
the
wind
and
snow
in
angry
conflict
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
fall
now
,
but
what
had
already
descended
was
torn
up
from
the
earth
,
whirled
round
by
brief
shrieking
gusts
,
and
cast
into
a
hundred
fantastic
forms
.
  
<EOS>
The
Countess
seconded
Mrs.
Bretton
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
shall
not
go
out
,
"
said
she
,
placing
a
seat
for
herself
beside
her
father
's
arm
-
chair
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
look
after
him
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
go
into
town
,
will
you
,
papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ay
,
and
No
,
"
was
the
answer
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
and
Mrs.
Bretton
are
_
very
_
good
to
me
,
Polly
 
kind
,
you
know
,
and
attentive
;
if
you
pet
me
in
a
very
nice
manner
,
and
make
much
of
me
,
I
may
possibly
be
induced
to
wait
an
hour
after
breakfast
and
see
whether
this
razor
-
edged
wind
settles
.
<EOS>
But
,
you
see
,
you
give
me
no
breakfast
;
you
offer
me
nothing
<EOS>
:
you
let
me
starve
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Quick
!
<EOS>
please
,
Mrs.
Bretton
,
and
pour
out
the
coffee
,
"
entreated
Paulina
,
"
whilst
I
take
care
of
the
Count
de
Bassompierre
in
other
respects
:
since
he
grew
into
a
Count
,
he
has
needed
_
<EOS>
so
_
much
attention
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
separated
and
prepared
a
roll
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
papa
,
are
your
"
pistolets
'
charged
,
"
said
she
.
"
<EOS>
And
there
is
some
marmalade
,
just
the
same
sort
of
marmalade
we
used
to
have
at
Bretton
,
and
which
you
said
was
as
good
as
if
it
had
been
conserved
in
Scotland
 
"
  
"
And
which
your
little
ladyship
used
to
beg
for
my
boy
 
<EOS>
do
you
remember
that
?
<EOS>
"
interposed
Mrs.
Bretton
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
forgotten
how
you
would
come
to
my
elbow
and
touch
my
sleeve
with
the
whisper
,
"
Please
,
ma'am
,
something
good
for
Graham
 
a
little
marmalade
,
or
honey
,
or
jam
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
mamma
,
"
broke
in
Dr.
John
,
laughing
,
yet
reddening
;
"
it
surely
was
not
so
:
I
could
not
have
cared
for
these
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
he
or
did
he
not
,
Paulina
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
liked
them
,
"
asserted
Paulina
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
blush
for
it
,
John
,
"
said
Mr.
Home
,
encouragingly
.
<EOS>
"
I
like
them
myself
yet
,
and
always
did
.
<EOS>
And
Polly
showed
her
sense
in
catering
for
a
friend
's
material
comforts
<EOS>
:
it
was
I
who
put
her
into
the
way
of
such
good
manners
 
nor
do
I
let
her
forget
them
.
<EOS>
Polly
,
offer
me
a
small
slice
of
that
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
papa
:
but
remember
you
are
only
waited
upon
with
this
assiduity
;
on
condition
of
being
persuadable
,
and
reconciling
yourself
to
La
Terrasse
for
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mrs.
Bretton
,
"
said
the
Count
,
"
I
want
to
get
rid
of
my
daughter
 
to
send
her
to
school
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
of
any
good
school
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
Lucy
's
place
 
Madame
Beck
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Miss
Snowe
is
in
a
school
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
teacher
,
"
I
said
,
and
was
rather
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
saying
this
.
<EOS>
For
a
little
while
I
had
been
feeling
as
if
placed
in
a
false
position
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
and
son
knew
my
circumstances
;
but
the
Count
and
his
daughter
did
not
.
<EOS>
They
might
choose
to
vary
by
some
shades
their
hitherto
cordial
manner
towards
me
,
when
aware
of
my
grade
in
society
.
<EOS>
I
spoke
then
readily
:
but
a
swarm
of
thoughts
I
had
not
anticipated
nor
invoked
,
rose
dim
at
the
words
,
making
me
sigh
involuntarily
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Home
did
not
lift
his
eyes
from
his
breakfast
-
plate
for
about
two
minutes
,
nor
did
he
speak
;
perhaps
he
had
not
caught
the
words
 
<EOS>
perhaps
he
thought
that
on
a
confession
of
that
nature
,
politeness
would
interdict
comment
:
the
Scotch
are
proverbially
proud
;
and
homely
as
was
Mr.
Home
in
look
,
simple
in
habits
and
tastes
,
I
have
all
along
intimated
that
he
was
not
without
his
share
of
the
national
quality
.
<EOS>
Was
his
a
pseudo
pride
?
<EOS>
was
it
real
dignity
?
<EOS>
I
leave
the
question
undecided
in
its
wide
sense
.
<EOS>
Where
it
concerned
me
individually
I
can
only
answer
:
then
,
and
always
,
he
showed
himself
a
true
-
hearted
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
By
nature
he
was
a
feeler
and
a
thinker
;
over
his
emotions
and
his
reflections
spread
a
mellowing
of
melancholy
;
more
than
a
mellowing
:
in
trouble
and
bereavement
it
became
a
cloud
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
much
about
Lucy
Snowe
;
what
he
knew
,
he
did
not
very
accurately
comprehend
:
indeed
his
misconceptions
of
my
character
often
made
me
smile
;
but
he
saw
my
walk
in
life
lay
rather
on
the
shady
side
of
the
hill
:
he
gave
me
credit
for
doing
my
endeavour
to
keep
the
course
honestly
straight
;
he
would
have
helped
me
if
he
could
:
having
no
opportunity
of
helping
,
he
still
wished
me
well
.
<EOS>
When
he
did
look
at
me
,
his
eye
was
kind
;
when
he
did
speak
,
his
voice
was
benevolent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yours
,
"
said
he
,
"
is
an
arduous
calling
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
health
and
strength
to
win
in
it
 
success
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
fair
little
daughter
did
not
take
the
information
quite
so
composedly
:
she
fixed
on
me
a
pair
of
eyes
wide
with
wonder
 
almost
with
dismay
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
a
teacher
?
"
cried
she
.
<EOS>
Then
,
having
paused
on
the
unpalatable
idea
,
"
Well
,
I
never
knew
what
you
were
,
nor
ever
thought
of
asking
:
<EOS>
for
me
,
you
were
always
Lucy
Snowe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
am
I
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
forbear
inquiring
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yourself
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
But
do
you
really
teach
here
,
in
Villette
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
like
it
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
always
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
do
you
go
on
with
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
father
looked
at
,
and
,
I
feared
,
was
going
to
check
her
;
but
he
only
said
,
"
Proceed
,
Polly
,
proceed
with
that
catechism
 
prove
yourself
the
little
wiseacre
you
are
.
<EOS>
If
Miss
Snowe
were
to
blush
and
look
confused
,
I
should
have
to
bid
you
hold
your
tongue
;
and
you
and
I
would
sit
out
the
present
meal
in
some
disgrace
;
but
she
only
smiles
,
so
push
her
hard
,
multiply
the
cross
-
questions
.
<EOS>
Well
,
Miss
Snowe
,
why
do
you
go
on
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Chiefly
,
I
fear
,
for
the
sake
of
the
money
I
get
.
"
  
"
Not
then
from
motives
of
pure
philanthropy
?
<EOS>
Polly
and
I
were
clinging
to
that
hypothesis
as
the
most
lenient
way
of
accounting
for
your
eccentricity
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
 
no
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Rather
for
the
roof
of
shelter
I
am
thus
enabled
to
keep
over
my
head
;
and
for
the
comfort
of
mind
it
gives
me
to
think
that
while
I
can
work
for
myself
,
I
am
spared
the
pain
of
being
a
burden
to
anybody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
say
what
you
will
,
I
pity
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
up
that
pity
,
Miss
de
Bassompierre
;
take
it
up
in
both
hands
,
as
you
might
a
little
callow
gosling
squattering
out
of
bounds
without
leave
;
put
it
back
in
the
warm
nest
of
a
heart
whence
it
issued
,
and
receive
in
your
ear
this
whisper
.
<EOS>
If
my
Polly
ever
came
to
know
by
experience
the
uncertain
nature
of
this
world
's
goods
,
I
should
like
her
to
act
as
Lucy
acts
:
to
work
for
herself
,
that
she
might
burden
neither
kith
nor
kin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
papa
,
"
said
she
,
pensively
and
tractably
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
poor
Lucy
!
<EOS>
I
thought
she
was
a
rich
lady
,
and
had
rich
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
thought
like
a
little
simpleton
.
<EOS>
_
I
_
never
thought
so
.
<EOS>
When
I
had
time
to
consider
Lucy
's
manner
and
aspect
,
which
was
not
often
,
I
saw
she
was
one
who
had
to
guard
and
not
be
guarded
;
to
act
and
not
be
served
:
and
<EOS>
this
lot
has
,
I
imagine
,
helped
her
to
an
experience
for
which
,
if
she
live
long
enough
to
realize
its
full
benefit
,
she
may
yet
bless
Providence
.
<EOS>
But
this
school
,
"
he
pursued
,
changing
his
tone
from
grave
to
gay
:
"
would
Madame
Beck
admit
my
Polly
,
do
you
think
,
Miss
Lucy
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
there
needed
but
to
try
Madame
;
it
would
soon
be
seen
:
she
was
fond
of
English
pupils
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
,
sir
,
"
I
added
,
"
will
but
take
Miss
de
Bassompierre
in
your
carriage
this
very
afternoon
,
I
think
I
can
answer
for
it
that
Rosine
,
the
portress
,
will
not
be
very
slow
in
answering
your
ring
;
and
Madame
,
I
am
sure
,
will
put
on
her
best
pair
of
gloves
to
come
into
the
salon
to
receive
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
,
"
responded
Mr.
Home
,
"
<EOS>
I
see
no
sort
of
necessity
there
is
for
delay
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hurst
can
send
what
she
calls
her
young
lady
's
"
things
'
after
her
;
Polly
can
settle
down
to
her
horn
-
book
before
night
;
and
you
,
Miss
Lucy
,
I
trust
,
will
not
disdain
to
cast
an
occasional
eye
upon
her
,
and
let
me
know
,
from
time
to
time
,
how
she
gets
on
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
approve
of
the
arrangement
,
Countess
de
Bassompierre
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
Countess
hemmed
and
hesitated
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
thought
I
had
finished
my
education
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
only
proves
how
much
we
may
be
mistaken
in
our
thoughts
I
hold
a
far
different
opinion
,
as
most
of
these
will
who
have
been
auditors
of
your
profound
knowledge
of
life
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
my
little
girl
,
thou
hast
much
to
learn
;
and
papa
ought
to
have
taught
thee
more
than
he
has
done
!
<EOS>
Come
,
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
try
Madame
Beck
;
and
the
weather
seems
settling
,
and
I
have
finished
my
breakfast
 
"
  
"
But
,
papa
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
an
obstacle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
enormous
,
papa
;
it
can
never
be
got
over
;
it
is
as
large
as
you
in
your
greatcoat
,
and
the
snowdrift
on
the
top
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
,
like
that
snowdrift
,
capable
of
melting
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
it
is
of
too
 
too
solid
flesh
:
it
is
just
your
own
self
.
<EOS>
Miss
Lucy
,
warn
Madame
Beck
not
to
listen
to
any
overtures
about
taking
me
,
because
,
in
the
end
,
it
would
turn
out
that
she
would
have
to
take
papa
too
:
as
he
is
so
teasing
,
I
will
just
tell
tales
about
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
and
all
of
you
listen
:
<EOS>
About
five
years
ago
,
when
I
was
twelve
years
old
,
he
took
it
into
his
head
that
he
was
spoiling
me
;
that
I
was
growing
unfitted
for
the
world
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
,
and
nothing
would
serve
or
satisfy
him
,
but
I
must
go
to
school
.
<EOS>
I
cried
,
and
so
on
;
but
M.
de
Bassompierre
proved
hard
-
hearted
,
quite
firm
and
flinty
,
and
to
school
I
went
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
result
?
<EOS>
In
the
most
admirable
manner
,
papa
came
to
school
likewise
:
every
other
day
he
called
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
Madame
Aigredoux
grumbled
,
but
it
was
of
no
use
;
and
so
,
at
last
,
papa
and
I
were
both
,
in
a
manner
,
expelled
.
<EOS>
Lucy
can
just
tell
Madame
Beck
this
little
trait
:
it
is
only
fair
to
let
her
know
what
she
has
to
expect
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bretton
asked
Mr.
Home
what
he
had
to
say
in
answer
to
this
statement
.
<EOS>
As
he
made
no
defence
,
judgment
was
given
against
him
,
and
Paulina
triumphed
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
had
other
moods
besides
the
arch
and
naïve
.
<EOS>
After
breakfast
;
when
the
two
elders
withdrew
 
I
suppose
to
talk
over
certain
of
Mrs.
Bretton
's
business
matters
 
and
the
Countess
,
Dr.
Bretton
,
and
I
,
were
for
a
short
time
alone
together
 
<EOS>
all
the
child
left
her
;
with
us
,
more
nearly
her
companions
in
age
,
she
rose
at
once
to
the
little
lady
:
<EOS>
her
very
face
seemed
to
alter
;
that
play
of
feature
,
and
candour
of
look
,
which
,
when
she
spoke
to
her
father
,
made
it
quite
dimpled
and
round
,
yielded
to
an
aspect
more
thoughtful
,
and
lines
distincter
and
less
_
mobile
_
.
  
<EOS>
No
doubt
Graham
noted
the
change
as
well
as
I.
<EOS>
He
stood
for
some
minutes
near
the
window
,
looking
out
at
the
snow
;
presently
he
,
approached
the
hearth
,
and
entered
into
conversation
,
but
not
quite
with
his
usual
ease
:
fit
topics
did
not
seem
to
rise
to
his
lips
;
he
chose
them
fastidiously
,
hesitatingly
,
and
consequently
infelicitously
:
he
spoke
vaguely
of
Villette
 
<EOS>
its
inhabitants
,
its
notable
sights
and
buildings
.
<EOS>
He
was
answered
by
Miss
de
Bassompierre
in
quite
womanly
sort
;
with
intelligence
,
with
a
manner
not
indeed
wholly
disindividualized
:
a
tone
,
a
glance
,
a
gesture
,
here
and
there
,
rather
animated
and
quick
than
measured
and
stately
,
still
recalled
little
Polly
;
but
yet
there
was
so
fine
and
even
a
polish
,
so
calm
and
courteous
a
grace
,
gilding
and
sustaining
these
peculiarities
,
that
a
less
sensitive
man
than
Graham
would
not
have
ventured
to
seize
upon
them
as
vantage
points
,
leading
to
franker
intimacy
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
while
Dr.
Bretton
continued
subdued
,
and
,
for
him
,
sedate
,
he
was
still
observant
.
<EOS>
Not
one
of
those
petty
impulses
and
natural
breaks
escaped
him
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
miss
one
characteristic
movement
,
one
hesitation
in
language
,
or
one
lisp
in
utterance
.
<EOS>
At
times
,
in
speaking
fast
,
she
still
lisped
;
but
coloured
whenever
such
lapse
occurred
,
and
in
a
painstaking
,
conscientious
manner
,
quite
as
amusing
as
the
slight
error
,
repeated
the
word
more
distinctly
.
  
<EOS>
Whenever
she
did
this
,
Dr.
Bretton
smiled
.
<EOS>
Gradually
,
as
they
conversed
,
the
restraint
on
each
side
slackened
:
might
the
conference
have
but
been
prolonged
,
I
believe
it
would
soon
have
become
genial
:
already
to
Paulina
's
lip
and
cheek
returned
the
wreathing
,
dimpling
smile
;
she
lisped
once
,
and
forgot
to
correct
herself
.
<EOS>
And
Dr.
John
,
I
know
not
how
_
he
_
changed
,
but
change
he
did
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
grow
gayer
 
<EOS>
no
raillery
,
no
levity
sparkled
across
his
aspect
 
but
his
position
seemed
to
become
one
of
more
pleasure
to
himself
,
and
he
spoke
his
augmented
comfort
in
readier
language
,
in
tones
more
suave
.
<EOS>
Ten
years
ago
this
pair
had
always
found
abundance
to
say
to
each
other
;
the
intervening
decade
had
not
narrowed
the
experience
or
impoverished
the
intelligence
of
either
:
besides
,
there
are
certain
natures
of
which
the
mutual
influence
is
such
,
that
the
more
they
say
,
the
more
they
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
For
these
out
of
association
grows
adhesion
,
and
out
of
adhesion
,
amalgamation
.
  
<EOS>
Graham
,
however
,
must
go
:
his
was
a
profession
whose
claims
are
neither
to
be
ignored
nor
deferred
.
<EOS>
He
left
the
room
;
but
before
he
could
leave
the
house
there
was
a
return
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
he
came
back
 
not
for
the
paper
,
or
card
in
his
desk
,
which
formed
his
ostensible
errand
 
but
to
assure
himself
,
by
one
more
glance
,
that
Paulina
's
aspect
was
really
such
as
memory
was
bearing
away
:
that
he
had
not
been
viewing
her
somehow
by
a
partial
,
artificial
light
,
and
making
a
fond
mistake
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
he
found
the
impression
true
 
rather
<EOS>
,
indeed
,
he
gained
than
lost
by
this
return
:
he
took
away
with
him
a
parting
look
 
<EOS>
shy
,
but
very
soft
 
as
beautiful
,
as
innocent
,
as
any
little
fawn
could
lift
out
of
its
cover
of
fern
,
or
any
lamb
from
its
meadow
-
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Being
left
alone
,
Paulina
<EOS>
and
I
kept
silence
for
some
time
<EOS>
:
we
both
took
out
some
work
,
and
plied
a
mute
and
diligent
task
.
<EOS>
The
white
-
wood
workbox
of
old
days
was
now
replaced
by
one
inlaid
with
precious
mosaic
,
and
furnished
with
implements
of
gold
;
the
tiny
and
trembling
fingers
that
could
scarce
guide
the
needle
,
though
tiny
still
,
were
now
swift
and
skilful
:
but
there
was
the
same
busy
knitting
of
the
brow
,
the
same
little
dainty
mannerisms
,
the
same
quick
turns
and
movements
 
now
to
replace
a
stray
tress
,
and
anon
to
shake
from
the
silken
skirt
some
imaginary
atom
of
dust
 
<EOS>
some
clinging
fibre
of
thread
.
  
<EOS>
That
morning
I
was
disposed
for
silence
:
<EOS>
the
austere
fury
of
the
winter
-
day
had
on
me
an
awing
,
hushing
influence
.
<EOS>
That
passion
of
January
,
so
white
and
so
bloodless
,
was
not
yet
spent
:
the
storm
had
raved
itself
hoarse
,
but
seemed
no
nearer
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
Had
Ginevra
Fanshawe
been
my
companion
in
that
drawing
-
room
,
she
would
not
have
suffered
me
to
muse
and
listen
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
The
presence
just
gone
from
us
would
have
been
her
theme
;
and
how
she
would
have
rung
the
changes
on
one
topic
!
<EOS>
how
she
would
have
pursued
and
pestered
me
with
questions
and
surmises
 
worried
and
oppressed
me
with
comments
and
confidences
I
did
not
want
,
and
longed
to
avoid
.
  
<EOS>
Paulina
Mary
cast
once
or
twice
towards
me
a
quiet
but
penetrating
glance
of
her
dark
,
full
eye
;
her
lips
half
opened
,
as
if
to
the
impulse
of
coming
utterance
:
but
she
saw
and
delicately
respected
my
inclination
for
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
will
not
hold
long
,
"
I
thought
to
myself
;
for
I
was
not
accustomed
to
find
in
women
or
girls
any
power
of
self
-
control
,
or
strength
of
self
-
denial
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
knew
them
,
the
chance
of
a
gossip
about
their
usually
trivial
secrets
,
their
often
very
washy
and
paltry
feelings
,
was
a
treat
not
to
be
readily
foregone
.
  
<EOS>
The
little
Countess
promised
an
exception
:
she
sewed
till
she
was
tired
of
sewing
,
and
then
she
took
a
book
.
  
<EOS>
As
chance
would
have
it
,
she
had
sought
it
in
Dr.
Bretton
's
own
compartment
of
the
bookcase
;
and
it
proved
to
be
an
old
Bretton
book
 
some
illustrated
work
of
natural
history
.
<EOS>
Often
had
I
seen
her
standing
at
Graham
's
side
,
resting
that
volume
on
his
knee
,
and
reading
to
his
tuition
;
and
,
when
the
lesson
was
over
,
begging
,
as
a
treat
,
that
he
would
tell
her
all
about
the
pictures
.
<EOS>
I
watched
her
keenly
:
here
was
a
true
test
of
that
memory
she
had
boasted
would
her
recollections
now
be
faithful
?
  
<EOS>
Faithful
?
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
doubted
.
<EOS>
As
she
turned
the
leaves
,
over
her
face
passed
gleam
after
gleam
of
expression
,
the
least
intelligent
of
which
was
a
full
greeting
to
the
Past
.
<EOS>
And
then
she
turned
to
the
title
-
page
,
and
looked
at
the
name
written
in
the
schoolboy
hand
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
it
long
;
nor
was
she
satisfied
with
merely
looking
:
she
gently
passed
over
the
characters
the
tips
of
her
fingers
,
accompanying
the
action
with
an
unconscious
but
tender
smile
,
which
converted
the
touch
into
a
caress
.
<EOS>
Paulina
loved
the
Past
;
but
the
peculiarity
of
this
little
scene
was
,
that
she
_
said
_
<EOS>
nothing
<EOS>
:
she
could
feel
without
pouring
out
her
feelings
in
a
flux
of
words
.
  
<EOS>
She
now
occupied
herself
at
the
bookcase
for
nearly
an
hour
;
taking
down
volume
after
volume
,
and
renewing
her
acquaintance
with
each
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
she
seated
herself
on
a
low
stool
,
rested
her
cheek
on
her
hand
,
and
thought
,
and
still
was
mute
.
  
<EOS>
The
sound
of
the
front
door
opened
below
,
a
rush
of
cold
wind
,
and
her
father
's
voice
speaking
to
Mrs.
Bretton
in
the
hall
,
startled
her
at
last
.
<EOS>
She
sprang
up
:
<EOS>
she
was
down
-
stairs
in
one
second
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
!
papa
!
<EOS>
you
are
not
going
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
pet
,
I
must
go
into
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
too
 
_
too
_
cold
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
then
I
heard
M.
de
Bassompierre
showing
to
her
how
he
was
well
provided
against
the
weather
;
and
how
he
was
going
to
have
the
carriage
,
and
to
be
quite
snugly
sheltered
;
and
,
in
short
,
proving
that
she
need
not
fear
for
his
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
promise
to
come
back
here
this
evening
,
before
it
is
quite
dark
;
 
you
and
Dr.
Bretton
,
both
,
in
the
carriage
?
<EOS>
It
is
not
fit
to
ride
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
I
see
the
Doctor
,
I
will
tell
him
a
lady
has
laid
on
him
her
commands
to
take
care
of
his
precious
health
and
come
home
early
under
my
escort
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
must
say
a
lady
;
and
he
will
think
it
is
his
mother
,
and
be
obedient
<EOS>
And
,
papa
,
mind
to
come
soon
,
for
I
_
shall
_
watch
and
listen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
door
closed
,
and
the
carriage
rolled
softly
through
the
snow
;
and
back
returned
the
Countess
,
pensive
and
anxious
.
  
<EOS>
She
_
did
_
listen
,
and
watch
,
when
evening
closed
;
but
it
was
in
stillest
sort
:
walking
the
drawing
-
room
with
quite
noiseless
step
.
<EOS>
She
checked
at
intervals
her
velvet
march
;
inclined
her
ear
,
and
consulted
the
night
sounds
:
I
should
rather
say
,
the
night
silence
;
for
now
,
at
last
,
the
wind
was
fallen
.
<EOS>
The
sky
,
relieved
of
its
avalanche
,
lay
naked
and
pale
:
through
the
barren
boughs
of
the
avenue
we
could
see
it
well
,
and
note
also
the
polar
splendour
of
the
new
-
year
moon
 
an
orb
white
as
a
world
of
ice
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
late
when
we
saw
also
the
return
of
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
Paulina
had
no
dance
of
welcome
for
this
evening
.
<EOS>
It
was
with
a
sort
of
gravity
that
she
took
immediate
possession
of
her
father
,
as
he
entered
the
room
;
but
she
at
once
made
him
her
entire
property
,
led
him
to
the
seat
of
her
choice
,
and
,
while
softly
showering
round
him
honeyed
words
of
commendation
for
being
so
good
and
coming
home
<EOS>
so
soon
,
you
would
have
thought
it
was
entirely
by
the
power
of
her
little
hands
he
was
put
into
his
chair
,
and
settled
and
arranged
;
for
the
strong
man
seemed
to
take
pleasure
in
wholly
yielding
himself
to
this
dominion
-
potent
only
by
love
.
  
<EOS>
Graham
did
not
appear
till
some
minutes
after
the
Count
.
<EOS>
Paulina
half
turned
when
his
step
was
heard
:
they
spoke
,
but
only
a
word
or
two
;
their
fingers
met
a
moment
,
but
obviously
with
slight
contact
.
<EOS>
Paulina
remained
beside
her
father
;
Graham
threw
himself
into
a
seat
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
well
that
Mrs.
Bretton
and
Mr.
Home
had
a
great
deal
to
say
to
each
other
-
almost
an
inexhaustible
fund
of
discourse
in
old
recollections
;
otherwise
,
I
think
,
our
party
would
have
been
but
a
still
one
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
After
tea
,
Paulina
's
quick
needle
and
pretty
golden
thimble
were
busily
plied
by
the
lamp
-
light
,
but
her
tongue
rested
,
and
her
eyes
seemed
reluctant
to
raise
often
their
lids
,
so
smooth
and
so
full
-
fringed
.
<EOS>
Graham
,
too
,
must
have
been
tired
with
his
day
's
work
:
he
listened
dutifully
to
his
elders
and
betters
,
said
very
little
himself
,
and
followed
with
his
eye
the
gilded
glance
of
Paulina
's
thimble
;
as
if
it
had
been
some
bright
moth
on
the
wing
,
or
the
golden
head
of
some
darting
little
yellow
serpent
.
    
<EOS>
A
BURIAL
.
  
<EOS>
From
this
date
my
life
did
not
want
variety
;
I
went
out
a
good
deal
,
with
the
entire
consent
of
Madame
Beck
,
who
perfectly
approved
the
grade
of
my
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
That
worthy
directress
had
never
from
the
first
treated
me
otherwise
than
with
respect
;
and
when
she
found
that
I
was
liable
to
frequent
invitations
from
a
château
and
a
great
hotel
,
respect
improved
into
distinction
.
  
<EOS>
Not
that
she
was
fulsome
about
it
:
<EOS>
Madame
,
in
all
things
worldly
,
was
in
nothing
weak
;
there
was
measure
and
sense
in
her
hottest
pursuit
of
self
-
interest
,
calm
and
considerateness
in
her
closest
clutch
of
gain
;
without
,
then
,
laying
herself
open
to
my
contempt
as
a
time
-
server
and
a
toadie
,
she
marked
with
tact
that
she
was
pleased
people
connected
with
her
establishment
<EOS>
should
frequent
such
associates
as
must
cultivate
and
elevate
,
rather
than
those
who
might
deteriorate
and
depress
.
<EOS>
She
never
praised
either
me
or
my
friends
;
only
once
when
she
was
sitting
in
the
sun
in
the
garden
,
a
cup
of
coffee
at
her
elbow
and
the
Gazette
in
her
hand
,
looking
very
comfortable
,
and
I
came
up
and
asked
leave
of
absence
for
the
evening
,
she
delivered
herself
in
this
gracious
sort
:
    
<EOS>
"
Oui
,
oui
,
ma
bonne
amie
:
<EOS>
je
vous
donne
la
permission
de
coeur
et
de
gré
.
<EOS>
Votre
travail
dans
<EOS>
ma
maison
<EOS>
a
toujours
été
admirable
,
rempli
de
zèle
et
de
discrétion
:
<EOS>
vous
avez
bien
<EOS>
le
droit
de
vous
amuser
.
<EOS>
Sortez
donc
tant
que
vous
voudrez
.
<EOS>
Quant
à
votre
choix
de
connaissances
,
j'en
suis
contente
;
c'est
sage
,
digne
,
laudable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
closed
her
lips
and
resumed
the
Gazette
.
  
<EOS>
The
reader
will
not
too
gravely
regard
the
little
circumstance
that
about
this
time
the
triply
-
enclosed
packet
of
five
letters
temporarily
disappeared
from
my
bureau
.
<EOS>
Blank
dismay
was
naturally
my
first
sensation
on
making
the
discovery
;
but
in
a
moment
I
took
heart
of
grace
.
  
<EOS>
"
Patience
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
I
to
myself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
me
say
nothing
,
but
wait
peaceably
;
they
will
come
back
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
they
did
come
back
<EOS>
:
they
had
only
been
on
a
short
visit
to
Madame
's
chamber
;
having
passed
their
examination
,
they
came
back
duly
and
truly
:
<EOS>
I
found
them
all
right
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
she
thought
of
my
correspondence
?
<EOS>
What
estimate
did
she
form
of
Dr.
John
Bretton
's
epistolary
powers
?
<EOS>
In
what
light
did
the
often
very
pithy
thoughts
,
the
generally
sound
,
and
sometimes
original
opinions
,
set
,
without
pretension
,
in
an
easily
-
flowing
,
spirited
style
,
appear
to
her
?
<EOS>
How
did
she
like
that
genial
,
half
<EOS>
humorous
vein
,
which
to
me
gave
such
delight
?
<EOS>
What
did
she
think
of
the
few
kind
words
scattered
here
and
there
-
not
thickly
,
as
the
diamonds
were
scattered
in
the
valley
of
Sindbad
,
but
sparely
,
as
those
gems
lie
in
unfabled
beds
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
Madame
Beck
!
<EOS>
how
seemed
these
things
to
you
?
  
<EOS>
I
think
in
Madame
Beck
's
eyes
the
five
letters
found
a
certain
favour
.
<EOS>
One
day
after
she
had
_
borrowed
_
them
of
me
(
in
speaking
of
so
suave
a
little
woman
,
one
ought
to
use
suave
terms
)
<EOS>
,
I
caught
her
examining
me
with
a
steady
contemplative
gaze
,
a
little
puzzled
,
but
not
at
all
malevolent
.
<EOS>
It
was
during
that
brief
space
between
lessons
,
when
the
pupils
turned
out
into
the
court
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
recreation
;
she
and
I
remained
in
the
first
classe
alone
:
when
I
met
her
eye
,
her
thoughts
forced
themselves
partially
through
her
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
Il
y
a
,
"
said
she
,
"
quelquechose
de
bien
remarquable
dans
le
caractère
Anglais
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
,
Madame
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
gave
a
little
laugh
,
repeating
the
word
"
<EOS>
how
"
in
English
.
  
<EOS>
"
Je
<EOS>
ne
saurais
<EOS>
vous
dire
"
how
;
"
mais
,
enfin
,
les
Anglais
<EOS>
ont
des
<EOS>
idées
<EOS>
à
eux
,
en
amitié
<EOS>
,
en
amour
,
en
tout
.
<EOS>
Mais
au
moins
il
n'est
pas
besoin
de
les
surveiller
,
"
she
added
,
getting
up
and
trotting
away
like
the
compact
little
pony
she
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
hope
,
"
murmured
I
to
myself
,
"
you
will
graciously
let
alone
my
letters
for
the
future
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
something
came
rushing
into
my
eyes
,
dimming
utterly
their
vision
,
blotting
from
sight
the
schoolroom
,
the
garden
,
the
bright
winter
sun
,
as
I
remembered
that
never
more
would
letters
,
such
as
she
had
read
,
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
the
last
of
them
.
<EOS>
That
goodly
river
on
whose
banks
I
had
sojourned
,
of
whose
waves
a
few
reviving
drops
had
trickled
to
my
lips
,
was
bending
to
another
course
:
it
was
leaving
my
little
hut
and
field
forlorn
and
sand
-
dry
,
pouring
its
wealth
of
waters
far
away
.
<EOS>
The
change
was
right
,
just
,
natural
;
not
a
word
could
be
said
:
but
I
loved
my
Rhine
,
my
Nile
;
I
had
almost
worshipped
my
Ganges
,
and
I
grieved
that
the
grand
tide
should
roll
estranged
,
should
vanish
like
a
false
mirage
.
<EOS>
Though
stoical
,
I
was
not
quite
a
stoic
;
drops
streamed
fast
on
my
hands
,
on
my
desk
:
I
wept
one
sultry
shower
,
heavy
and
brief
.
  
<EOS>
But
soon
I
said
to
myself
,
"
The
Hope
I
am
bemoaning
suffered
and
made
me
suffer
much
<EOS>
:
it
did
not
die
till
it
was
full
time
:
following
an
agony
so
lingering
,
death
ought
to
be
welcome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Welcome
I
endeavoured
to
make
it
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
long
pain
had
made
patience
a
habit
.
<EOS>
In
the
end
I
closed
the
eyes
of
my
dead
,
covered
its
face
,
and
composed
its
limbs
with
great
calm
.
  
<EOS>
The
letters
,
however
,
must
be
put
away
,
out
of
sight
:
people
who
have
undergone
bereavement
always
jealously
gather
together
and
lock
away
mementos
:
it
is
not
supportable
to
be
stabbed
to
the
heart
each
moment
by
sharp
revival
of
regret
.
  
<EOS>
One
vacant
holiday
afternoon
(
the
Thursday
)
going
to
my
treasure
,
with
intent
to
consider
its
final
disposal
,
I
perceived
 
and
<EOS>
this
time
with
a
strong
impulse
of
displeasure
 
that
it
had
been
again
tampered
with
:
<EOS>
the
packet
was
there
,
indeed
,
but
the
ribbon
which
secured
it
had
been
untied
and
retied
;
and
by
other
symptoms
I
knew
that
my
drawer
had
been
visited
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
little
too
much
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
herself
was
the
soul
of
discretion
,
besides
having
as
strong
a
brain
and
sound
a
judgment
as
ever
furnished
a
human
head
;
that
she
should
know
the
contents
of
my
casket
,
was
not
pleasant
,
but
might
be
borne
.
<EOS>
Little
Jesuit
inquisitress
as
she
was
,
she
could
see
things
in
a
true
light
,
and
understand
them
in
an
unperverted
sense
;
but
the
idea
that
she
had
ventured
to
communicate
information
,
thus
gained
,
to
others
;
that
she
had
,
perhaps
,
amused
herself
with
a
companion
over
documents
,
in
my
eyes
most
sacred
,
shocked
me
cruelly
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
that
such
was
the
case
I
now
saw
reason
to
fear
;
I
even
guessed
her
confidant
.
<EOS>
Her
kinsman
,
M.
Paul
Emanuel
,
had
spent
yesterday
evening
with
her
:
she
was
much
in
the
habit
of
consulting
him
,
and
of
discussing
with
him
matters
she
broached
to
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
This
very
morning
,
in
class
,
that
gentleman
had
favoured
me
with
a
glance
which
he
seemed
to
have
borrowed
from
Vashti
,
the
actress
<EOS>
;
I
had
not
at
the
moment
comprehended
that
blue
,
yet
lurid
,
flash
out
of
his
angry
eye
;
but
I
read
its
meaning
now
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
,
I
believed
,
was
not
apt
to
regard
what
concerned
me
from
a
fair
point
of
view
,
nor
to
judge
me
with
tolerance
and
candour
:
I
had
always
found
him
severe
and
suspicious
:
<EOS>
the
thought
that
these
letters
,
mere
friendly
letters
as
they
were
,
had
fallen
once
,
and
might
fall
again
,
into
his
hands
,
jarred
my
very
soul
.
  
<EOS>
What
should
I
do
to
prevent
this
?
<EOS>
In
what
corner
of
this
strange
house
was
it
possible
to
find
security
or
secresy
?
<EOS>
Where
could
a
key
be
a
safeguard
,
or
a
padlock
a
barrier
?
  
<EOS>
In
the
grenier
?
<EOS>
No
,
I
did
not
like
the
grenier
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
most
of
the
boxes
and
drawers
there
were
mouldering
,
and
did
not
lock
.
<EOS>
Rats
,
too
,
gnawed
their
way
through
the
decayed
wood
;
and
mice
made
nests
amongst
the
litter
of
their
contents
:
my
dear
letters
(
most
dear
still
,
though
Ichabod
was
written
on
their
covers
)
might
be
consumed
by
vermin
;
certainly
the
writing
would
soon
become
obliterated
by
damp
.
<EOS>
No
;
the
grenier
would
not
do
 
but
<EOS>
where
then
?
  
<EOS>
While
pondering
this
problem
,
I
sat
in
the
dormitory
window
-
seat
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
frosty
afternoon
;
the
winter
sun
,
already
setting
,
gleamed
pale
on
the
tops
of
the
garden
-
shrubs
in
the
"
allée
défendue
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
One
great
old
pear
-
tree
 
<EOS>
the
nun
's
pear
-
tree
 
stood
up
a
tall
dryad
skeleton
,
grey
,
gaunt
,
and
stripped
.
<EOS>
A
thought
struck
me
 
one
of
those
queer
fantastic
thoughts
that
will
sometimes
strike
solitary
people
.
<EOS>
I
put
on
my
bonnet
,
cloak
,
and
furs
,
and
went
out
into
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
Bending
my
steps
to
the
old
historical
quarter
of
the
town
,
whose
hoax
and
overshadowed
precincts
I
always
sought
by
instinct
in
melancholy
moods
,
I
wandered
on
from
street
to
street
,
till
,
having
crossed
a
half
deserted
"
place
"
or
square
,
I
found
myself
before
a
sort
of
broker
's
shop
;
an
ancient
place
,
full
of
ancient
things
.
<EOS>
What
I
wanted
was
a
metal
box
which
might
be
soldered
,
or
a
thick
glass
jar
or
bottle
which
might
be
stoppered
or
sealed
hermetically
.
<EOS>
Amongst
miscellaneous
heaps
,
I
found
and
purchased
the
latter
article
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
made
a
little
roll
of
my
letters
,
wrapped
them
in
oiled
silk
,
bound
them
with
twine
,
and
,
having
put
them
in
the
bottle
,
got
the
old
Jew
broker
to
stopper
,
seal
,
and
make
it
air
-
tight
.
<EOS>
While
obeying
my
directions
,
he
glanced
at
me
now
and
then
suspiciously
from
under
his
frost
-
white
eyelashes
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
thought
there
was
some
evil
deed
on
hand
.
<EOS>
In
all
this
I
had
a
dreary
something
 
not
pleasure
 
but
a
sad
,
lonely
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
The
impulse
under
which
I
acted
,
the
mood
controlling
me
,
were
similar
to
the
impulse
and
the
mood
which
had
induced
me
to
visit
the
confessional
.
<EOS>
With
quick
walking
I
regained
the
pensionnat
just
at
dark
,
and
in
time
for
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
At
seven
o'clock
the
moon
rose
.
<EOS>
At
half
-
past
seven
,
when
the
pupils
and
teachers
were
at
study
,
and
Madame
Beck
was
with
her
mother
and
children
in
the
salle
-
à
-
manger
,
when
the
half
-
boarders
were
all
gone
home
,
and
Rosine
had
left
the
vestibule
,
and
all
was
still
 
I
shawled
myself
,
and
,
taking
the
sealed
jar
,
stole
out
through
the
first
-
classe
door
,
into
the
berceau
and
thence
into
the
"
allée
défendue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Methusaleh
,
the
pear
-
tree
,
stood
at
the
further
end
of
this
walk
,
near
my
seat
:
he
rose
up
,
dim
and
gray
,
above
the
lower
shrubs
round
him
.
<EOS>
Now
Methusaleh
,
though
so
very
old
,
was
of
sound
timber
still
;
only
there
was
a
hole
,
or
rather
a
deep
hollow
,
near
his
root
.
<EOS>
I
knew
there
was
such
a
hollow
,
hidden
partly
by
ivy
and
creepers
growing
thick
round
;
and
there
I
meditated
hiding
my
treasure
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
not
only
going
to
hide
a
treasure
 
I
meant
also
to
bury
a
grief
.
<EOS>
That
grief
over
which
I
had
lately
been
weeping
,
as
I
wrapped
it
in
its
winding
-
sheet
,
must
be
interred
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
I
cleared
away
the
ivy
,
and
found
the
hole
;
it
was
large
enough
to
receive
the
jar
,
and
I
thrust
it
deep
in
.
<EOS>
In
a
tool
-
shed
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
,
lay
the
relics
of
building
-
materials
,
left
by
masons
lately
employed
to
repair
a
part
of
the
premises
.
<EOS>
I
fetched
thence
a
slate
and
some
mortar
,
put
the
slate
on
the
hollow
,
secured
it
with
cement
,
covered
the
hole
with
black
mould
,
and
,
finally
,
replaced
the
ivy
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
I
rested
,
leaning
against
the
tree
;
lingering
,
like
any
other
mourner
,
beside
a
newly
-
sodded
grave
.
  
<EOS>
The
air
of
the
night
was
very
still
,
but
dim
with
a
peculiar
mist
,
which
changed
the
moonlight
into
a
luminous
haze
.
<EOS>
In
this
air
,
or
this
mist
,
there
was
some
quality
 
electrical
,
perhaps
 
which
acted
in
strange
sort
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
felt
then
as
I
had
felt
a
year
ago
in
England
 
on
a
night
when
the
aurora
borealis
was
streaming
and
sweeping
round
heaven
,
when
,
belated
in
lonely
fields
,
I
had
paused
to
watch
that
mustering
of
an
army
with
banners
 
<EOS>
that
quivering
of
serried
lances
 
that
swift
ascent
of
messengers
from
below
the
north
star
to
the
dark
,
high
keystone
of
heaven
's
arch
.
<EOS>
I
felt
,
not
happy
,
far
otherwise
,
but
strong
with
reinforced
strength
.
  
<EOS>
If
life
be
a
war
,
it
seemed
my
destiny
to
conduct
it
single
-
handed
.
<EOS>
I
pondered
now
how
to
break
up
my
winter
-
quarters
 
to
leave
an
encampment
where
food
and
forage
failed
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
to
effect
this
change
,
another
pitched
battle
must
be
fought
with
fortune
;
if
so
,
I
had
a
mind
to
the
encounter
:
too
poor
to
lose
,
God
might
destine
me
to
gain
.
<EOS>
But
what
road
was
open
?
 
<EOS>
what
plan
available
?
  
<EOS>
On
this
question
I
was
still
pausing
,
when
the
moon
,
so
dim
hitherto
,
seemed
to
shine
out
somewhat
brighter
:
a
ray
gleamed
even
white
before
me
,
and
a
shadow
became
distinct
and
marked
.
<EOS>
I
looked
more
narrowly
,
to
make
out
the
cause
of
this
well
-
defined
contrast
appearing
a
little
suddenly
in
the
obscure
alley
:
whiter
and
blacker
<EOS>
it
grew
on
my
eye
:
it
took
shape
with
instantaneous
transformation
.
<EOS>
I
stood
about
three
yards
from
a
tall
,
sable
-
robed
,
snowy
-
veiled
woman
.
  
<EOS>
Five
minutes
passed
.
<EOS>
I
neither
fled
nor
shrieked
.
<EOS>
She
was
there
still
.
<EOS>
I
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
?
<EOS>
and
why
do
you
come
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
stood
mute
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
face
 
<EOS>
no
features
<EOS>
:
all
below
her
brow
was
masked
with
a
white
cloth
;
but
she
had
eyes
,
and
they
viewed
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
felt
,
if
not
brave
,
yet
a
little
desperate
;
and
desperation
will
often
suffice
to
fill
the
post
and
do
the
work
of
courage
.
<EOS>
I
advanced
one
step
.
<EOS>
I
stretched
out
my
hand
,
for
I
meant
to
touch
her
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
recede
.
<EOS>
I
drew
nearer
:
her
recession
,
still
silent
,
became
swift
.
<EOS>
A
mass
of
shrubs
,
full
-
leaved
evergreens
,
laurel
and
dense
yew
,
intervened
between
me
and
what
I
followed
.
<EOS>
Having
passed
that
obstacle
,
I
looked
and
saw
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
waited
.
<EOS>
I
said
,
 
"
If
you
have
any
errand
to
men
,
come
back
and
deliver
it
.
"
<EOS>
Nothing
spoke
or
re
-
appeared
.
  
<EOS>
This
time
there
was
no
Dr.
John
to
whom
to
have
recourse
:
there
was
no
one
to
whom
I
dared
whisper
the
words
,
"
I
have
again
seen
the
nun
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
Paulina
Mary
sought
my
frequent
presence
in
the
Rue
Crécy
.
<EOS>
In
the
old
Bretton
days
,
though
she
had
never
professed
herself
fond
of
me
,
my
society
had
soon
become
to
her
a
sort
of
unconscious
necessary
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
notice
that
if
I
withdrew
to
my
room
,
she
would
speedily
come
trotting
after
me
,
and
opening
the
door
and
peeping
in
,
say
,
with
her
little
peremptory
accent
,
 
"
Come
down
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
sit
here
by
yourself
?
<EOS>
You
must
come
into
the
parlour
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
same
spirit
she
urged
me
now
 
"
Leave
the
Rue
Fossette
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
come
and
live
with
us
.
<EOS>
Papa
would
give
you
far
more
than
Madame
Beck
gives
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Home
himself
offered
me
a
handsome
sum
 
<EOS>
thrice
my
present
salary
 
if
I
would
accept
the
office
of
companion
to
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
declined
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
have
declined
had
I
been
poorer
than
I
was
,
and
with
scantier
fund
of
resource
,
more
stinted
narrowness
of
future
prospect
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
that
vocation
.
<EOS>
I
could
teach
;
I
could
give
lessons
;
but
to
be
either
a
private
governess
or
a
companion
was
unnatural
to
me
.
<EOS>
Rather
than
fill
the
former
post
in
any
great
house
,
I
would
deliberately
have
taken
a
housemaid
's
place
,
bought
a
strong
pair
of
gloves
,
swept
bedrooms
and
staircases
,
and
cleaned
stoves
and
locks
,
in
peace
and
independence
.
<EOS>
Rather
than
be
a
companion
,
I
would
have
made
shirts
and
starved
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
no
bright
lady
's
shadow
 
not
Miss
de
Bassompierre
's
.
<EOS>
Overcast
enough
it
was
my
nature
often
to
be
;
of
a
subdued
habit
I
was
:
<EOS>
but
the
dimness
and
depression
must
both
be
voluntary
 
such
as
<EOS>
kept
me
docile
at
my
desk
,
in
the
midst
of
my
now
well
-
accustomed
pupils
in
Madame
Beck
's
fist
classe
;
or
alone
,
at
my
own
bedside
,
in
her
dormitory
,
or
in
the
alley
and
seat
which
were
called
mine
,
in
her
garden
:
my
qualifications
were
not
convertible
,
nor
adaptable
;
they
could
not
be
made
the
foil
of
any
gem
,
the
adjunct
of
any
beauty
,
the
appendage
of
any
greatness
in
Christendom
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
and
I
,
without
assimilating
,
understood
each
other
well
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
_
her
_
companion
,
nor
her
children
's
governess
;
she
left
me
free
:
she
tied
me
to
nothing
 
not
to
herself
 
not
even
to
her
interests
:
<EOS>
once
,
when
she
had
for
a
fortnight
been
called
from
home
by
a
near
relation
's
illness
,
and
on
her
return
,
all
anxious
and
full
of
care
about
her
establishment
,
lest
something
in
her
absence
should
have
gone
wrong
finding
that
matters
had
proceeded
much
as
usual
,
and
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
glaring
neglect
 
<EOS>
she
made
each
of
the
teachers
a
present
,
in
acknowledgment
of
steadiness
.
<EOS>
To
my
bedside
she
came
at
twelve
o'clock
at
night
,
and
told
me
she
had
no
present
for
me
:
"
I
must
make
fidelity
advantageous
to
the
St.
Pierre
,
"
said
she
;
"
if
I
attempt
to
make
it
advantageous
to
you
,
there
will
arise
misunderstanding
between
us
 
perhaps
separation
.
<EOS>
One
thing
,
however
,
I
_
can
_
do
to
please
you
 
<EOS>
leave
you
alone
with
your
liberty
:
c'est
-
ce
que
je
ferai
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
kept
her
word
.
<EOS>
Every
slight
shackle
she
had
ever
laid
on
me
,
she
,
from
that
time
,
with
quiet
hand
removed
.
<EOS>
Thus
I
had
pleasure
in
voluntarily
respecting
her
rules
:
gratification
in
devoting
double
time
,
in
taking
double
pains
with
the
pupils
she
committed
to
my
charge
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
Mary
de
Bassompierre
,
I
visited
her
with
pleasure
,
though
I
would
not
live
with
her
.
<EOS>
My
visits
soon
taught
me
that
it
was
unlikely
<EOS>
even
my
occasional
and
voluntary
society
would
long
be
indispensable
to
her
.
<EOS>
M.
de
Bassompierre
,
for
his
part
,
seemed
impervious
to
this
conjecture
,
blind
to
this
possibility
;
unconscious
as
any
child
to
the
signs
,
the
likelihoods
,
the
fitful
beginnings
of
what
,
when
it
drew
to
an
end
,
he
might
not
approve
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
or
not
he
would
cordially
approve
,
I
used
to
speculate
.
<EOS>
Difficult
to
say
.
<EOS>
He
was
much
taken
up
with
scientific
interests
;
keen
,
intent
,
and
somewhat
oppugnant
in
what
concerned
his
favourite
pursuits
,
but
unsuspicious
and
trustful
in
the
ordinary
affairs
of
life
.
<EOS>
From
all
I
could
gather
,
he
seemed
to
regard
his
"
daughterling
"
as
still
but
a
child
,
and
probably
had
not
yet
admitted
the
notion
that
others
might
look
on
her
in
a
different
light
:
he
would
speak
of
what
should
be
done
when
"
Polly
"
was
a
woman
,
when
she
should
be
grown
up
;
and
"
Polly
,
"
standing
beside
his
chair
,
would
sometimes
smile
and
take
his
honoured
head
between
her
little
hands
,
and
kiss
his
iron
-
grey
locks
;
and
,
at
other
times
,
she
would
pout
and
toss
her
curls
:
but
she
never
said
,
"
Papa
,
I
_
am
_
grown
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
different
moods
for
different
people
.
<EOS>
With
her
father
she
really
was
still
a
child
,
or
child
-
like
,
affectionate
,
merry
,
and
playful
.
<EOS>
With
me
she
was
serious
,
and
as
womanly
as
thought
and
feeling
could
make
her
.
<EOS>
With
Mrs.
Bretton
she
was
docile
and
reliant
,
but
not
expansive
.
<EOS>
With
Graham
she
was
shy
,
at
present
very
shy
;
at
moments
she
tried
to
be
cold
;
on
occasion
she
endeavoured
to
shun
him
.
<EOS>
His
step
made
her
start
;
his
entrance
hushed
her
;
when
he
spoke
,
her
answers
failed
of
fluency
;
when
he
took
leave
,
she
remained
self
-
vexed
and
disconcerted
.
<EOS>
Even
her
father
noticed
this
demeanour
in
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
little
Polly
,
"
he
said
once
,
"
you
live
too
retired
a
life
;
if
you
grow
to
be
a
woman
with
these
shy
manners
,
you
will
hardly
be
fitted
for
society
.
<EOS>
You
really
make
quite
a
stranger
of
Dr.
Bretton
:
how
is
this
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
that
,
as
a
little
girl
,
you
used
to
be
rather
partial
to
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
Rather
_
,
papa
,
"
echoed
she
,
with
her
slightly
dry
,
yet
gentle
and
simple
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
do
n't
like
him
now
?
<EOS>
What
has
he
done
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nothing
.
<EOS>
Y
 
<EOS>
es
,
I
like
him
a
little
;
but
we
are
grown
strange
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
rub
it
off
,
Polly
;
rub
the
rust
and
the
strangeness
off
.
<EOS>
Talk
away
when
he
is
here
,
and
have
no
fear
of
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
He
_
does
not
talk
much
.
<EOS>
Is
he
afraid
of
me
,
do
you
think
,
papa
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
to
be
sure
,
what
man
would
not
be
afraid
of
such
a
little
silent
lady
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
tell
him
some
day
not
to
mind
my
being
silent
.
<EOS>
Say
that
it
is
my
way
,
and
that
I
have
no
unfriendly
intention
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
way
,
you
little
chatter
-
box
?
<EOS>
So
far
from
being
your
way
,
it
is
only
your
whim
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'll
improve
,
papa
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
very
pretty
was
the
grace
with
which
,
the
next
day
,
she
tried
to
keep
her
word
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
make
the
effort
to
converse
affably
with
Dr.
John
on
general
topics
.
<EOS>
The
attention
called
into
her
guest
's
face
a
pleasurable
glow
;
he
met
her
with
caution
,
and
replied
to
her
in
his
softest
tones
,
as
if
there
was
a
kind
of
gossamer
happiness
hanging
in
the
air
which
he
feared
to
disturb
by
drawing
too
deep
a
breath
.
<EOS>
Certainly
,
in
her
timid
yet
earnest
advance
to
friendship
,
it
could
not
be
denied
that
there
was
a
most
exquisite
and
fairy
charm
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
Doctor
was
gone
,
she
approached
her
father
's
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
keep
my
word
,
papa
?
<EOS>
Did
I
behave
better
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
Polly
behaved
like
a
queen
.
<EOS>
I
shall
become
quite
proud
of
her
if
this
improvement
continues
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
we
shall
see
her
receiving
my
guests
with
quite
a
calm
,
grand
manner
.
<EOS>
Miss
Lucy
and
I
will
have
to
look
about
us
,
and
polish
up
all
our
best
airs
and
graces
lest
we
should
be
thrown
into
the
shade
.
<EOS>
Still
,
Polly
,
there
is
a
little
flutter
,
a
little
tendency
to
stammer
now
and
then
,
and
even
,
to
lisp
as
you
lisped
when
you
were
six
years
old
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
papa
,
"
interrupted
she
indignantly
,
"
that
ca
n't
be
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
appeal
to
Miss
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Did
she
not
,
in
answering
Dr.
Bretton
's
question
as
to
whether
she
had
ever
seen
the
palace
of
the
Prince
of
Bois
l'Etang
,
say
,
"
yeth
,
"
she
had
been
there
"
theveral

times
?

<EOS>
"
Papa
,
you
are
satirical
,
you
are
méchant
!
<EOS>
I
can
pronounce
all
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
as
clearly
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
But
tell
me
this
you
are
very
particular
in
making
me
be
civil
to
Dr.
Bretton
,
do
you
like
him
yourself
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
be
sure
:
for
old
acquaintance
sake
I
like
him
:
then
he
is
a
very
good
son
to
his
mother
;
besides
being
a
kind
-
hearted
fellow
and
clever
in
his
profession
:
yes
,
the
callant
is
well
enough
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
_
Callant
_
!
<EOS>
Ah
,
Scotchman
!
<EOS>
Papa
,
is
it
the
Edinburgh
or
the
Aberdeen
accent
you
have
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Both
,
my
pet
,
both
:
and
doubtless
the
Glaswegian
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
It
is
that
which
enables
me
to
speak
French
so
well
:
<EOS>
a
gude
Scots
tongue
always
succeeds
well
at
the
French
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
_
<EOS>
The
_
French
!
<EOS>
Scotch
again
:
incorrigible
papa
.
<EOS>
You
,
too
,
need
schooling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Polly
,
you
must
persuade
Miss
Snowe
to
undertake
both
you
and
me
;
to
make
you
steady
and
womanly
,
and
me
refined
and
classical
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
light
in
which
M.
de
Bassompierre
evidently
regarded
"
Miss
Snowe
,
"
used
to
occasion
me
much
inward
edification
.
<EOS>
What
contradictory
attributes
of
character
we
sometimes
find
ascribed
to
us
,
according
to
the
eye
with
which
we
are
viewed
!
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
esteemed
me
learned
and
blue
;
Miss
Fanshawe
,
caustic
,
ironic
,
and
cynical
;
Mr.
Home
,
a
model
teacher
,
the
essence
of
the
sedate
and
discreet
:
somewhat
conventional
,
perhaps
,
too
strict
,
limited
,
and
scrupulous
,
but
still
the
pink
and
pattern
of
governess
-
correctness
;
whilst
another
person
,
Professor
Paul
Emanuel
,
to
wit
,
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
intimating
his
opinion
that
mine
was
rather
a
fiery
and
rash
nature
 
adventurous
,
indocile
,
and
audacious
.
<EOS>
I
smiled
at
them
all
.
<EOS>
If
any
one
knew
me
it
was
little
Paulina
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
would
not
be
Paulina
's
nominal
and
paid
companion
,
genial
and
harmonious
as
I
began
to
find
her
intercourse
,
she
persuaded
me
to
join
her
in
some
study
,
as
a
regular
and
settled
means
of
sustaining
communication
:
she
proposed
the
German
language
,
which
,
like
myself
,
she
found
difficult
of
mastery
.
<EOS>
We
agreed
to
take
our
lessons
in
the
Rue
Crécy
of
the
same
mistress
;
this
arrangement
threw
us
together
for
some
hours
of
every
week
.
<EOS>
M.
de
Bassompierre
seemed
quite
pleased
:
it
perfectly
met
his
approbation
,
that
Madame
Minerva
Gravity
should
associate
a
portion
of
her
leisure
with
that
of
his
fair
and
dear
child
.
  
<EOS>
That
other
self
-
elected
judge
of
mine
,
the
professor
in
the
Rue
Fossette
,
discovering
by
some
surreptitious
spying
means
,
that
I
was
no
longer
so
stationary
as
hitherto
,
but
went
out
regularly
at
certain
hours
of
certain
days
,
took
it
upon
himself
to
place
me
under
surveillance
.
<EOS>
People
said
M.
Emanuel
had
been
brought
up
amongst
Jesuits
.
<EOS>
I
should
more
readily
have
accredited
this
report
had
his
manoeuvres
been
better
masked
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
I
doubted
it
.
<EOS>
Never
was
a
more
undisguised
schemer
,
a
franker
,
looser
intriguer
.
<EOS>
He
would
analyze
his
own
machinations
:
elaborately
contrive
plots
,
and
forthwith
indulge
in
explanatory
boasts
of
their
skill
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
I
was
more
amused
or
provoked
,
by
his
stepping
up
to
me
one
morning
and
whispering
solemnly
that
he
"
had
his
eye
on
me
:
_
he
<EOS>
_
at
least
would
discharge
the
duty
of
a
friend
,
and
not
leave
me
entirely
to
my
own
devices
.
<EOS>
My
,
proceedings
seemed
at
present
very
unsettled
:
he
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
them
:
he
thought
his
cousin
Beck
very
much
to
blame
in
suffering
this
sort
of
fluttering
inconsistency
in
a
teacher
attached
to
her
house
.
<EOS>
What
had
a
person
devoted
to
a
serious
calling
,
that
of
education
,
to
do
with
Counts
and
Countesses
,
hotels
and
châteaux
?
<EOS>
To
him
,
I
seemed
altogether
'
en
l'air
.
"
<EOS>
On
his
faith
,
he
believed
I
went
out
six
days
in
the
seven
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
Monsieur
exaggerated
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
had
enjoyed
the
advantage
of
a
little
change
lately
,
but
not
before
it
had
become
necessary
;
and
the
privilege
was
by
no
means
exercised
in
excess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Necessary
!
<EOS>
How
was
it
necessary
?
<EOS>
I
was
well
enough
,
he
supposed
?
<EOS>
Change
necessary
!
<EOS>
He
would
recommend
me
to
look
at
the
Catholic
"
religieuses
,
"
and
study
_
their
_
lives
.
<EOS>
_
They
_
asked
no
change
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
am
no
judge
of
what
expression
crossed
my
face
when
he
thus
spoke
,
but
it
was
one
which
provoked
him
:
he
accused
me
of
being
reckless
,
worldly
,
and
epicurean
;
ambitious
of
greatness
,
and
feverishly
athirst
for
the
pomps
and
vanities
of
life
.
<EOS>
It
seems
I
had
no
"
dévouement
,
"
no
"
récueillement
"
in
my
character
;
no
spirit
of
grace
,
faith
,
sacrifice
,
or
self
-
abasement
.
<EOS>
Feeling
the
inutility
of
answering
these
charges
,
I
mutely
continued
the
correction
of
a
pile
of
English
exercises
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
could
see
in
me
nothing
Christian
:
<EOS>
like
many
other
Protestants
,
I
revelled
in
the
pride
and
self
-
will
of
paganism
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
slightly
turned
from
him
,
nestling
still
closer
under
the
wing
of
silence
.
  
<EOS>
A
vague
sound
grumbled
between
his
teeth
;
it
could
not
surely
be
a
"
juron
:
"
he
was
too
religious
for
that
;
but
I
am
certain
I
heard
the
word
_
sacré
_
.
<EOS>
Grievous
to
relate
,
the
same
word
was
repeated
,
with
the
unequivocal
addition
of
_
mille
<EOS>
_
something
,
when
I
passed
him
about
two
hours
afterwards
in
the
corridor
,
prepared
to
go
and
take
my
German
lesson
in
the
Rue
Crécy
.
<EOS>
Never
was
a
better
little
man
,
in
some
points
,
than
M.
Paul
:
never
,
in
others
,
a
more
waspish
little
despot
.
     
<EOS>
Our
German
mistress
,
Fräulein
Anna
Braun
,
was
a
worthy
,
hearty
woman
,
of
about
forty
-
five
;
she
ought
,
perhaps
,
to
have
lived
in
the
days
of
Queen
Elizabeth
,
as
she
habitually
consumed
,
for
her
first
and
second
breakfasts
,
beer
and
beef
:
also
,
her
direct
and
downright
Deutsch
nature
seemed
to
suffer
a
sensation
of
cruel
restraint
from
what
she
called
our
English
reserve
;
though
we
thought
we
were
very
cordial
with
her
:
but
we
did
not
slap
her
on
the
shoulder
,
and
if
we
consented
to
kiss
her
cheek
,
it
was
done
quietly
,
and
without
any
explosive
smack
.
<EOS>
These
omissions
oppressed
and
depressed
her
considerably
;
still
,
on
the
whole
,
we
got
on
very
well
.
<EOS>
Accustomed
to
instruct
foreign
girls
,
who
hardly
ever
will
think
and
study
for
themselves
 
who
have
no
idea
of
grappling
with
a
difficulty
,
and
overcoming
it
by
dint
of
reflection
or
application
 
our
progress
,
which
in
truth
was
very
leisurely
,
seemed
to
astound
her
.
<EOS>
In
her
eyes
,
we
were
a
pair
of
glacial
prodigies
,
cold
,
proud
,
and
preternatural
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
Countess
_
was
_
a
little
proud
,
a
little
fastidious
:
and
perhaps
,
with
her
native
delicacy
and
beauty
,
she
had
a
right
to
these
feelings
;
but
I
think
it
was
a
total
mistake
to
ascribe
them
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
never
evaded
the
morning
salute
,
which
Paulina
would
slip
when
she
could
;
nor
was
a
certain
little
manner
of
still
disdain
a
weapon
known
in
my
armoury
of
defence
;
whereas
,
Paulina
always
kept
it
clear
,
fine
,
and
bright
,
and
any
rough
German
sally
called
forth
at
once
its
steelly
glisten
.
  
<EOS>
Honest
Anna
Braun
,
in
some
measure
,
felt
this
difference
;
and
while
she
half
-
feared
,
half
-
worshipped
Paulina
,
as
a
sort
of
dainty
nymph
 
<EOS>
an
Undine
 
<EOS>
she
took
refuge
with
me
,
as
a
being
all
mortal
,
and
of
easier
mood
.
  
<EOS>
A
book
we
liked
well
to
read
and
translate
was
Schiller
's
Ballads
;
Paulina
soon
learned
to
read
them
beautifully
;
the
Fräulein
would
listen
to
her
with
a
broad
smile
of
pleasure
,
and
say
her
voice
sounded
like
music
.
<EOS>
She
translated
them
,
too
,
with
a
facile
flow
of
language
,
and
in
a
strain
of
kindred
and
poetic
fervour
:
her
cheek
would
flush
,
her
lips
tremblingly
smile
,
her
beauteous
eyes
kindle
or
melt
as
she
went
on
.
<EOS>
She
learnt
the
best
by
heart
,
and
would
often
recite
them
when
we
were
alone
together
.
<EOS>
One
she
liked
well
<EOS>
was
"
Des
Mädchens
Klage
:
"
<EOS>
that
is
,
she
liked
well
to
repeat
the
words
,
she
found
plaintive
melody
in
the
sound
;
the
sense
she
would
criticise
.
<EOS>
She
murmured
,
as
we
sat
over
the
fire
one
evening
:
    
<EOS>
Du
Heilige
,
rufe
dein
Kind
zurück
,
Ich
habe
genossen
das
irdische
Glück
,
Ich
habe
gelebt
und
geliebet
!
  
<EOS>
"
Lived
and
loved
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
"
is
that
the
summit
of
earthly
happiness
,
the
end
of
life
 
to
love
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
it
is
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
the
extreme
of
mortal
misery
,
it
may
be
sheer
waste
of
time
,
and
fruitless
torture
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
If
Schiller
had
said
to
_
be
_
loved
,
he
might
have
come
nearer
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Is
not
that
another
thing
,
Lucy
,
to
be
loved
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
may
be
:
but
why
consider
the
subject
?
<EOS>
What
is
love
to
you
?
<EOS>
What
do
you
know
about
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
crimsoned
,
half
in
irritation
,
half
in
shame
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Lucy
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
wo
n't
take
that
from
you
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
well
for
papa
to
look
on
me
as
a
baby
:
I
rather
prefer
that
he
should
thus
view
me
;
but
_
you
<EOS>
_
know
and
shall
learn
to
acknowledge
that
I
am
verging
on
my
nineteenth
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
matter
if
it
were
your
twenty
-
ninth
;
we
will
anticipate
no
feelings
by
discussion
and
conversation
;
we
will
not
talk
about
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
indeed
!
"
said
she
 
all
in
hurry
and
heat
 
"
you
may
think
to
check
and
hold
me
in
,
as
much
as
you
please
;
but
I
_
have
_
talked
about
it
,
and
heard
about
it
too
;
and
a
great
deal
and
lately
,
and
disagreeably
and
detrimentally
:
and
in
a
way
you
would
n't
approve
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
the
vexed
,
triumphant
,
pretty
,
naughty
being
laughed
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
discern
what
she
meant
,
and
I
would
not
ask
her
:
I
was
nonplussed
.
<EOS>
Seeing
,
however
,
the
utmost
innocence
in
her
countenance
 
combined
with
some
transient
perverseness
and
petulance
 
<EOS>
I
said
at
last
,
    
<EOS>
"
Who
talks
to
you
disagreeably
and
detrimentally
on
such
matters
?
<EOS>
Who
that
has
near
access
to
you
would
dare
to
do
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
"
replied
she
more
softly
,
"
it
is
a
person
who
makes
me
miserable
sometimes
;
and
I
wish
she
would
keep
away
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
who
,
Paulina
,
can
it
be
?
<EOS>
You
puzzle
me
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
 
<EOS>
it
is
my
cousin
Ginevra
.
<EOS>
Every
time
she
has
leave
to
visit
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
she
calls
here
,
and
whenever
she
finds
me
alone
she
begins
to
talk
about
her
admirers
.
<EOS>
Love
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
You
should
hear
all
she
has
to
say
about
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
have
heard
it
,
"
said
I
,
quite
coolly
;
"
and
on
the
whole
,
perhaps
it
is
as
well
you
should
have
heard
it
too
:
<EOS>
it
is
not
to
be
regretted
,
it
is
all
right
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
surely
,
Ginevra
's
mind
can
not
influence
yours
.
<EOS>
You
can
look
over
both
her
head
and
her
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
does
influence
me
very
much
.
<EOS>
She
has
the
art
of
disturbing
my
happiness
and
unsettling
my
opinions
.
<EOS>
She
hurts
me
through
the
feelings
and
people
dearest
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
she
say
,
Paulina
?
<EOS>
Give
me
some
idea
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
counteraction
of
the
damage
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
people
I
have
longest
and
most
esteemed
are
degraded
by
her
.
<EOS>
She
does
not
spare
Mrs.
Bretton
 
<EOS>
she
does
not
spare
....
<EOS>
Graham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
daresay
:
<EOS>
and
how
does
she
mix
up
these
with
her
sentiment
and
her
....
<EOS>
_love
<EOS>
_
?
<EOS>
She
does
mix
them
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lucy
,
she
is
insolent
;
and
,
I
believe
,
false
.
<EOS>
You
know
Dr.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
We
both
know
him
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
careless
and
proud
;
but
when
was
he
ever
mean
or
slavish
?
<EOS>
Day
after
day
she
shows
him
to
me
kneeling
at
her
feet
,
pursuing
her
like
her
shadow
.
<EOS>
She
 
repulsing
him
with
insult
,
and
he
imploring
her
with
infatuation
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
is
it
true
?
<EOS>
Is
any
of
it
true

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
true
that
he
once
thought
her
handsome
:
does
she
give
him
out
as
still
her
suitor
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
says
she
might
marry
him
any
day
:
he
only
waits
her
consent

<EOS>
"
It
is
these
tales
which
have
caused
that
reserve
in
your
manner
towards
Graham
which
your
father
noticed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
They
have
certainly
made
me
all
doubtful
about
his
character
.
<EOS>
As
Ginevra
speaks
,
they
do
not
carry
with
them
the
sound
of
unmixed
truth
:
I
believe
she
exaggerates
 
perhaps
invents
 
<EOS>
but
I
want
to
know
how
far
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
we
bring
Miss
Fanshawe
to
some
proof
.
<EOS>
Give
her
an
opportunity
of
displaying
the
power
she
boasts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

I
could
do
that
to

morrow

Papa
has
asked
some
gentlemen
to
dinner
,
all
savants

<EOS>
Graham
,
who
,
papa
is
beginning
to
discover
,
is
a
savant
,
too
 
skilled
,
they
say
,
in
more
than
one
branch
of
science
 
is
among
the
number
.
<EOS>
Now
I
should
be
miserable
to
sit
at
table
unsupported
,
amidst
such
a
party
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
talk
to
Messieurs
A
and
Z
 
,
the
Parisian
Academicians
:
all
my
new
credit
for
manner
would
be
put
in
peril
.
<EOS>
You
and
Mrs.
Bretton
must
come
for
my
sake
;
Ginevra
,
at
a
word
,
will
join
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
then
I
will
carry
a
message
of
invitation
,
and
she
shall
have
the
chance
of
justifying
her
character
for
veracity

THE
HÔTEL
CRÉCY
.
  
<EOS>
The
morrow
turned
out
a
more
lively
and
busy
day
than
we
 
or
than
I
,
at
least
-
had
anticipated
.
<EOS>
It
seems
it
was
the
birthday
of
one
of
the
young
princes
of
Labassecour
-
the
eldest
,
I
think
,
<EOS>
the
Duc
de
Dindonneau
,
and
a
general
holiday
was
given
in
his
honour
at
the
schools
,
and
especially
at
the
principal
"
Athénée
,
"
or
college
.
<EOS>
The
youth
of
that
institution
had
also
concocted
,
and
were
to
present
a
loyal
address
;
for
which
purpose
they
were
to
be
assembled
in
the
public
building
where
the
yearly
examinations
were
conducted
,
and
the
prizes
distributed
.
<EOS>
After
the
ceremony
of
presentation
,
an
oration
,
or
"
discours
,
"
was
to
follow
from
one
of
the
professors
.
  
<EOS>
Several
of
M.
de
Bassompierre
's
friends
-
the
savants
-
being
more
or
less
connected
with
the
Athénée
,
they
were
expected
to
attend
on
this
occasion
;
together
with
the
worshipful
municipality
of
Villette
,
M.
le
Chevalier
Staas
,
the
burgomaster
,
and
the
parents
and
kinsfolk
of
the
Athenians
in
general
.
<EOS>
M.
de
Bassompierre
was
engaged
by
his
friends
to
accompany
them
;
his
fair
daughter
would
,
of
course
,
be
of
the
party
,
and
she
wrote
a
little
note
to
Ginevra
and
myself
,
bidding
us
come
early
that
we
might
join
her
.
  
<EOS>
As
Miss
Fanshawe
<EOS>
and
I
were
dressing
in
the
dormitory
of
the
Rue
Fossette
,
<EOS>
she
(
Miss
F.
)
suddenly
burst
into
a
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
now
?
"
I
asked
;
for
she
had
suspended
the
operation
of
arranging
her
attire
,
and
was
gazing
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
so
odd
,
"
she
replied
,
with
her
usual
half
-
honest
half
-
insolent
unreserve
,
"
that
you
and
I
should
now
be
so
much
on
a
level
,
visiting
in
the
same
sphere
;
having
the
same
connections
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
"
said
I
;
"
I
had
not
much
respect
for
the
connections
you
chiefly
frequented
awhile
ago
:
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
and
Co.
would
never
have
suited
me
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
_
are
_
you
,
Miss
Snowe
?
<EOS>
"
she
inquired
,
in
a
tone
of
such
undisguised
and
unsophisticated
curiosity
,
as
made
me
laugh
in
my
turn
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
used
to
call
yourself
a
nursery
governess
;
when
you
first
came
here
you
really
had
the
care
of
the
children
in
this
house
:
I
have
seen
you
carry
little
Georgette
in
your
arms
,
like
a
bonne
 
few
governesses
would
have
condescended
so
far
 
and
now
Madame
Beck
treats
you
with
more
courtesy
than
she
treats
the
Parisienne
,
St.
Pierre
;
and
that
proud
chit
,
my
cousin
,
makes
you
her
bosom
friend
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wonderful
!
<EOS>
"
I
agreed
,
much
amused
at
her
mystification
.
<EOS>
"
Who
am
I
indeed
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
a
personage
in
disguise
.
<EOS>
Pity
I
do
n't
look
the
character
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
you
are
not
more
flattered
by
all
this
,
"
she
went
on
;
"
you
take
it
with
strange
composure
.
<EOS>
If
you
really
are
the
nobody
I
once
thought
you
,
you
must
be
a
cool
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
The
nobody
you
once
thought
me
!
"
<EOS>
I
repeated
,
and
my
face
grew
a
little
hot
;
but
I
would
not
be
angry
:
of
what
importance
was
a
school
-
girl
's
crude
use
of
the
terms
nobody
and
somebody
?
<EOS>
I
confined
myself
,
therefore
,
to
the
remark
that
I
had
merely
met
with
civility
;
and
asked
"
what
she
saw
in
civility
to
throw
the
recipient
into
a
fever
of
confusion
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
ca
n't
help
wondering
at
some
things
,
"
she
persisted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wondering
at
marvels
of
your
own
manufacture
.
<EOS>
Are
you
ready
at
last
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
let
me
take
your
arm
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not
:
we
will
walk
side
by
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
she
took
my
arm
,
she
always
leaned
upon
me
her
whole
weight
;
and
,
as
I
was
not
a
gentleman
,
or
her
lover
,
I
did
not
like
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
again
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
by
offering
to
take
your
arm
,
to
intimate
approbation
of
your
dress
and
general
appearance
:
I
meant
it
as
a
compliment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
?
<EOS>
You
meant
,
in
short
,
to
express
that
you
are
not
ashamed
to
be
seen
in
the
street
with
me
?
<EOS>
That
if
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
should
be
fondling
her
lapdog
at
some
window
,
or
Colonel
de
Hamal
picking
his
teeth
in
a
balcony
,
and
should
catch
a
glimpse
of
us
,
you
would
not
quite
blush
for
your
companion
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
she
,
with
that
directness
which
was
her
best
point
 
which
gave
an
honest
plainness
to
her
very
fibs
when
she
told
them
 
which
was
,
in
short
,
the
salt
,
the
sole
preservative
ingredient
of
a
character
otherwise
not
formed
to
keep
.
  
<EOS>
I
delegated
the
trouble
of
commenting
on
this
"
yes
"
to
my
countenance
;
or
rather
,
my
under
-
lip
voluntarily
anticipated
my
tongue
of
course
<EOS>
,
reverence
and
solemnity
were
not
the
feelings
expressed
in
the
look
I
gave
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Scornful
,
sneering
creature
!
<EOS>
"
she
went
on
,
as
we
crossed
a
great
square
,
and
entered
the
quiet
,
pleasant
park
,
our
nearest
way
to
the
Rue
Crécy
.
<EOS>
"
Nobody
in
this
world
was
ever
such
a
Turk
to
me
as
you
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
bring
it
on
yourself
:
let
me
alone
:
have
the
sense
to
be
quiet
:
I
will
let
you
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
if
one
_
could
_
let
you
alone
,
when
you
are
so
peculiar
and
so
mysterious
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
mystery
and
peculiarity
being
entirely
the
conception
of
your
own
brain
 
maggots
 
neither
more
nor
less
,
be
so
good
as
to
keep
them
out
of
my
sight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
_
are
_
<EOS>
you
anybody
?
<EOS>
"
persevered
she
,
pushing
her
hand
,
in
spite
of
me
,
under
my
arm
;
and
that
arm
pressed
itself
with
inhospitable
closeness
against
my
side
,
by
way
of
keeping
out
the
intruder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
am
a
rising
character
:
once
an
old
lady
's
companion
,
then
a
nursery
-
governess
,
now
a
school
-
teacher
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
 
_
do
_
tell
me
who
you
are
?
<EOS>
I
'll
not
repeat
it
,
"
she
urged
,
adhering
with
ludicrous
tenacity
to
the
wise
notion
of
an
incognito
she
had
got
hold
of
;
and
she
squeezed
the
arm
of
which
she
had
now
obtained
full
possession
,
and
coaxed
and
conjured
till
I
was
obliged
to
pause
in
the
park
to
laugh
.
<EOS>
Throughout
our
walk
she
rang
the
most
fanciful
changes
on
this
theme
;
proving
,
by
her
obstinate
credulity
,
or
incredulity
,
her
incapacity
to
conceive
how
any
person
not
bolstered
up
by
birth
or
wealth
,
not
supported
by
some
consciousness
of
name
or
connection
,
could
maintain
an
attitude
of
reasonable
integrity
.
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
it
quite
sufficed
to
my
mental
tranquillity
that
I
was
known
where
it
imported
that
known
I
should
be
;
the
rest
sat
on
me
easily
:
pedigree
,
social
position
,
and
recondite
intellectual
acquisition
,
occupied
about
the
same
space
and
place
in
my
interests
and
thoughts
;
they
were
my
third
-
class
lodgers
 
to
whom
could
be
assigned
only
the
small
sitting
-
room
and
the
little
back
bedroom
:
even
if
the
dining
and
drawing
-
rooms
stood
empty
,
I
never
confessed
it
to
them
,
as
thinking
minor
accommodations
better
suited
to
their
circumstances
.
<EOS>
The
world
,
I
soon
learned
,
held
a
different
estimate
:
and
I
make
no
doubt
,
the
world
is
very
right
in
its
view
,
yet
believe
also
that
I
am
not
quite
wrong
in
mine
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
people
whom
a
lowered
position
degrades
morally
,
to
whom
loss
of
connection
costs
loss
of
self
-
respect
:
are
not
these
justified
in
placing
the
highest
value
on
that
station
and
association
which
is
their
safeguard
from
debasement
?
<EOS>
If
a
man
feels
that
he
would
become
contemptible
in
his
own
eyes
were
it
generally
known
that
his
ancestry
were
simple
and
not
gentle
,
poor
and
not
rich
,
workers
and
not
capitalists
,
would
it
be
right
severely
to
blame
him
for
keeping
these
fatal
facts
out
of
sight
 
for
starting
,
trembling
,
quailing
at
the
chance
which
threatens
exposure
?
<EOS>
The
longer
we
live
,
the
more
out
experience
widens
;
the
less
prone
are
we
to
judge
our
neighbour
's
conduct
,
to
question
the
world
's
wisdom
:
wherever
an
accumulation
of
small
defences
is
found
,
whether
surrounding
the
prude
's
virtue
or
the
man
of
the
world
's
respectability
,
there
,
be
sure
,
it
is
needed
.
  
<EOS>
We
reached
the
Hôtel
Crécy
;
Paulina
was
ready
;
Mrs.
Bretton
was
with
her
;
and
,
under
her
escort
and
that
of
M.
de
Bassompierre
,
we
were
soon
conducted
to
the
place
of
assembly
,
and
seated
in
good
seats
,
at
a
convenient
distance
from
the
Tribune
.
<EOS>
The
youth
of
the
Athénée
were
marshalled
before
us
,
the
municipality
and
their
bourgmestre
were
in
places
of
honour
,
the
young
princes
,
with
their
tutors
,
occupied
a
conspicuous
position
,
and
the
body
of
the
building
was
crowded
with
the
aristocracy
and
first
burghers
of
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
Concerning
the
identity
of
the
professor
by
whom
the
"
discours
"
was
to
be
delivered
,
I
had
as
yet
entertained
neither
care
nor
question
.
<EOS>
Some
vague
expectation
I
had
that
a
savant
would
stand
up
and
deliver
a
formal
speech
,
half
dogmatism
to
the
Athenians
,
half
flattery
to
the
princes
.
  
<EOS>
The
Tribune
was
yet
empty
when
we
entered
,
but
in
ten
minutes
after
it
was
filled
;
suddenly
,
in
a
second
of
time
,
a
head
,
chest
,
and
arms
grew
above
the
crimson
desk
.
<EOS>
This
head
I
knew
:
its
colour
,
shape
,
port
,
expression
,
were
familiar
both
to
me
and
Miss
Fanshawe
;
the
blackness
and
closeness
of
cranium
,
the
amplitude
and
paleness
of
brow
,
the
blueness
and
fire
of
glance
,
were
details
so
domesticated
in
the
memory
,
and
so
knit
with
many
a
whimsical
association
,
as
almost
by
this
their
sudden
apparition
,
to
tickle
fancy
to
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
confess
,
for
my
part
,
I
did
laugh
till
I
was
warm
;
but
then
I
bent
my
head
,
and
made
my
handkerchief
and
a
lowered
veil
the
sole
confidants
of
my
mirth
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
was
glad
to
see
M.
Paul
;
I
think
it
was
rather
pleasant
than
otherwise
,
to
behold
him
set
up
there
,
fierce
and
frank
,
dark
and
candid
,
testy
and
fearless
,
as
when
regnant
on
his
estrade
in
class
.
<EOS>
His
presence
was
such
a
surprise
:
I
had
not
once
thought
of
expecting
him
,
though
I
knew
he
filled
the
chair
of
Belles
Lettres
in
the
college
.
<EOS>
With
_
him
_
in
that
Tribune
,
I
felt
sure
that
neither
formalism
nor
flattery
would
be
our
doom
;
but
for
what
was
vouchsafed
us
,
for
what
was
poured
suddenly
,
rapidly
,
continuously
,
on
our
heads
 
I
own
I
was
not
prepared
.
  
<EOS>
He
spoke
to
the
princes
,
the
nobles
,
the
magistrates
,
and
the
burghers
,
with
just
the
same
ease
,
with
almost
the
same
pointed
,
choleric
earnestness
,
with
which
he
was
wo
nt
to
harangue
the
three
divisions
of
the
Rue
Fossette
.
<EOS>
The
collegians
he
addressed
,
not
as
schoolboys
,
but
as
future
citizens
and
embryo
patriots
.
<EOS>
The
times
which
have
since
come
on
Europe
had
not
been
foretold
yet
,
and
M.
Emanuel
's
spirit
seemed
new
to
me
.
<EOS>
Who
would
have
thought
the
flat
and
fat
soil
of
Labassecour
could
yield
political
convictions
and
national
feelings
,
such
as
were
now
strongly
expressed
?
<EOS>
Of
the
bearing
of
his
opinions
I
need
here
give
no
special
indication
;
yet
it
may
be
permitted
me
to
say
that
I
believed
the
little
man
not
more
earnest
than
right
in
what
he
said
:
with
all
his
fire
he
was
severe
and
sensible
;
he
trampled
Utopian
theories
under
his
heel
;
he
rejected
wild
dreams
with
scorn
;
 
but
when
he
looked
in
the
face
of
tyranny
 
<EOS>
oh
,
then
there
opened
a
light
in
his
eye
worth
seeing
;
and
when
he
spoke
of
injustice
,
his
voice
gave
no
uncertain
sound
,
but
reminded
me
rather
of
the
band
-
trumpet
,
ringing
at
twilight
from
the
park
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
his
audience
were
generally
susceptible
of
sharing
his
flame
in
its
purity
;
but
some
of
the
college
youth
caught
fire
as
he
eloquently
told
them
what
should
be
their
path
and
endeavour
in
their
country
's
and
in
Europe
's
future
.
<EOS>
They
gave
him
a
long
,
loud
,
ringing
cheer
,
as
he
concluded
:
with
all
his
fierceness
,
he
was
their
favourite
professor
.
  
<EOS>
As
our
party
left
the
Hall
,
he
stood
at
the
entrance
;
he
saw
and
knew
me
,
and
lifted
his
hat
;
he
offered
his
hand
in
passing
,
and
uttered
the
words
"
Qu'en
dites
vous
?
"
 
<EOS>
question
eminently
characteristic
,
and
reminding
me
,
even
in
this
his
moment
of
triumph
,
of
that
inquisitive
restlessness
,
that
absence
of
what
I
considered
desirable
self
-
control
,
which
were
amongst
his
faults
.
<EOS>
He
should
not
have
cared
just
then
to
ask
what
I
thought
,
or
what
anybody
thought
,
but
he
_
did
_
care
,
and
he
was
too
natural
to
conceal
,
too
impulsive
to
repress
his
wish
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
if
I
blamed
his
over
-
eagerness
,
I
liked
his
_
naiveté
_
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
praised
him
:
I
had
plenty
of
praise
in
my
heart
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
no
words
on
my
lips
.
<EOS>
Who
_
has
_
words
at
the
right
moment
?
<EOS>
I
stammered
some
lame
expressions
;
but
was
truly
glad
when
other
people
,
coming
up
with
profuse
congratulations
,
covered
my
deficiency
by
their
redundancy
.
  
<EOS>
A
gentleman
introduced
him
to
M.
de
Bassompierre
;
and
the
Count
,
who
had
likewise
been
highly
gratified
,
asked
him
to
join
his
friends
(
for
the
most
part
M.
Emanuel
's
likewise
)
,
and
to
dine
with
them
at
the
Hôtel
Crécy
.
<EOS>
He
declined
dinner
,
for
he
was
a
man
always
somewhat
shy
at
meeting
the
advances
of
the
wealthy
:
there
was
a
strength
of
sturdy
independence
in
the
stringing
of
his
sinews
 
not
obtrusive
,
but
pleasant
enough
to
discover
as
one
advanced
in
knowledge
of
his
character
;
he
promised
,
however
,
to
step
in
with
his
friend
,
M.
A
 
,
a
French
Academician
,
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
At
dinner
that
day
,
Ginevra
and
Paulina
each
looked
,
in
her
own
way
,
very
beautiful
;
<EOS>
the
former
,
perhaps
,
boasted
the
advantage
in
material
charms
,
but
the
latter
shone
pre
-
eminent
for
attractions
more
subtle
and
spiritual
:
for
light
and
eloquence
of
eye
,
for
grace
of
mien
,
for
winning
variety
of
expression
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
's
dress
of
deep
crimson
relieved
well
her
light
curls
,
and
harmonized
with
her
rose
-
like
bloom
.
<EOS>
Paulina
's
attire
 
in
fashion
close
,
though
faultlessly
neat
,
but
in
texture
clear
and
white
 
made
the
eye
grateful
for
the
delicate
life
of
her
complexion
,
for
the
soft
animation
of
her
countenance
,
for
the
tender
depth
of
her
eyes
,
for
the
brown
shadow
and
bounteous
flow
of
her
hair
 
darker
than
that
of
her
Saxon
cousin
,
as
were
also
her
eyebrows
,
her
eyelashes
,
her
full
irids
,
and
large
mobile
pupils
.
<EOS>
Nature
having
traced
all
these
details
slightly
,
and
with
a
careless
hand
,
in
Miss
Fanshawe
's
case
;
and
in
Miss
de
Bassompierre
's
,
wrought
them
to
a
high
and
delicate
finish
.
  
<EOS>
Paulina
was
awed
by
the
savants
,
but
not
quite
to
mutism
:
she
conversed
modestly
,
diffidently
;
not
without
effort
,
but
with
so
true
a
sweetness
,
so
fine
and
penetrating
a
sense
,
that
her
father
more
than
once
suspended
his
own
discourse
to
listen
,
and
fixed
on
her
an
eye
of
proud
delight
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
polite
Frenchman
,
M.
Z
 
,
a
very
learned
,
but
quite
a
courtly
man
,
who
had
drawn
her
into
discourse
.
<EOS>
I
was
charmed
with
her
French
;
it
was
faultless
 
<EOS>
the
structure
correct
,
the
idioms
true
,
the
accent
pure
;
Ginevra
,
who
had
lived
half
her
life
on
the
Continent
,
could
do
nothing
like
it
not
that
words
ever
failed
Miss
Fanshawe
,
but
real
accuracy
and
purity
<EOS>
she
neither
possessed
,
nor
in
any
number
of
years
would
acquire
.
<EOS>
Here
,
too
,
M.
de
Bassompierre
was
gratified
;
for
,
on
the
point
of
language
,
he
was
critical
.
  
<EOS>
Another
listener
and
observer
there
was
;
one
who
,
detained
by
some
exigency
of
his
profession
,
had
come
in
late
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
Both
ladies
were
quietly
scanned
by
Dr.
Bretton
,
at
the
moment
of
taking
his
seat
at
the
table
;
and
that
guarded
survey
was
more
than
once
renewed
.
<EOS>
His
arrival
roused
Miss
Fanshawe
,
who
had
hitherto
appeared
listless
:
she
now
became
smiling
and
complacent
,
talked
 
though
what
she
said
was
rarely
to
the
purpose
 
or
rather
,
was
of
a
purpose
somewhat
mortifyingly
below
the
standard
of
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Her
light
,
disconnected
prattle
might
have
gratified
Graham
once
;
perhaps
it
pleased
him
still
<EOS>
:
perhaps
it
was
only
fancy
which
suggested
the
thought
that
,
while
his
eye
was
filled
and
his
ear
fed
,
his
taste
,
his
keen
zest
,
his
lively
intelligence
,
were
not
equally
consulted
and
regaled
.
<EOS>
It
is
certain
that
,
restless
and
exacting
as
seemed
the
demand
on
his
attention
,
he
yielded
courteously
all
that
was
required
:
his
manner
showed
neither
pique
nor
coolness
:
<EOS>
Ginevra
was
his
neighbour
,
and
to
her
,
during
dinner
,
he
almost
exclusively
confined
his
notice
.
<EOS>
She
appeared
satisfied
,
and
passed
to
the
drawing
-
room
in
very
good
spirits
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
,
no
sooner
had
we
reached
that
place
of
refuge
,
than
she
again
became
flat
and
listless
:
throwing
herself
on
a
couch
,
she
denounced
both
the
"
discours
"
and
the
dinner
as
stupid
affairs
,
and
inquired
of
her
cousin
how
she
could
hear
such
a
set
of
prosaic
"
gros
-
bonnets
"
as
her
father
gathered
about
him
.
<EOS>
The
moment
the
gentlemen
were
heard
to
move
,
her
railings
ceased
:
she
started
up
,
flew
to
the
piano
,
and
dashed
at
it
with
spirit
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Bretton
entering
,
one
of
the
first
,
took
up
his
station
beside
her
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
would
not
long
maintain
that
post
:
there
was
a
position
near
the
hearth
to
which
I
expected
to
see
him
attracted
:
this
position
he
only
scanned
with
his
eye
;
while
_
he
_
looked
,
others
drew
in
.
<EOS>
The
grace
and
mind
of
Paulina
charmed
these
thoughtful
Frenchmen
:
the
fineness
of
her
beauty
,
the
soft
courtesy
of
her
manner
,
her
immature
,
but
real
and
inbred
tact
,
pleased
their
national
taste
;
they
clustered
about
her
,
not
indeed
to
talk
science
;
which
would
have
rendered
her
dumb
,
but
to
touch
on
many
subjects
in
letters
,
in
arts
,
in
actual
life
,
on
which
it
soon
appeared
that
she
had
both
read
and
reflected
.
<EOS>
I
listened
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
that
though
Graham
stood
aloof
,
he
listened
too
:
<EOS>
his
hearing
as
well
as
his
vision
was
very
fine
,
quick
,
discriminating
.
<EOS>
I
knew
he
gathered
the
conversation
;
I
felt
that
the
mode
in
which
it
was
sustained
suited
him
exquisitely
 
pleased
him
almost
to
pain
.
  
<EOS>
In
Paulina
there
was
more
force
,
both
of
feeling
and
character
;
than
most
people
thought
 
than
Graham
himself
imagined
 
than
she
would
ever
show
to
those
who
did
not
wish
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
To
speak
truth
,
reader
,
there
is
no
excellent
beauty
,
no
accomplished
grace
,
no
reliable
refinement
,
without
strength
as
excellent
,
as
complete
,
as
trustworthy
.
<EOS>
As
well
might
you
look
for
good
fruit
and
blossom
on
a
rootless
and
sapless
tree
,
as
for
charms
that
will
endure
in
a
feeble
and
relaxed
nature
.
<EOS>
For
a
little
while
,
the
blooming
semblance
of
beauty
may
flourish
round
weakness
;
but
it
can
not
bear
a
blast
<EOS>
:
it
soon
fades
,
even
in
serenest
sunshine
.
<EOS>
Graham
would
have
started
had
any
suggestive
spirit
whispered
of
the
sinew
and
the
stamina
sustaining
that
delicate
nature
;
but
I
who
had
known
her
as
a
child
,
knew
or
guessed
by
what
a
good
and
strong
root
her
graces
held
to
the
firm
soil
of
reality
.
  
<EOS>
While
Dr.
Bretton
listened
,
and
waited
an
opening
in
the
magic
circle
,
his
glance
restlessly
sweeping
the
room
at
intervals
,
lighted
by
chance
on
me
,
where
I
sat
in
a
quiet
nook
not
far
from
my
godmother
and
M.
de
Bassompierre
,
who
,
as
usual
,
were
engaged
in
what
Mr.
Home
called
"
a
two
-
handed
crack
:
"
what
the
Count
would
have
interpreted
as
a
tête
-
à
-
tête
.
<EOS>
Graham
smiled
recognition
,
crossed
the
room
,
asked
me
how
I
was
,
told
me
I
looked
pale
.
<EOS>
I
also
had
my
own
smile
at
my
own
thought
:
it
was
now
about
three
months
since
Dr.
John
had
spoken
to
me
-
a
lapse
of
which
he
was
not
even
conscious
.
<EOS>
He
sat
down
,
and
became
silent
.
<EOS>
His
wish
was
rather
to
look
than
converse
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
and
Paulina
were
now
opposite
to
him
:
he
could
gaze
his
fill
:
he
surveyed
both
forms
 
studied
both
faces
.
  
<EOS>
Several
new
guests
,
ladies
as
well
as
gentlemen
,
had
entered
the
room
since
dinner
,
dropping
in
for
the
evening
conversation
;
and
amongst
the
gentlemen
,
I
may
incidentally
observe
,
<EOS>
I
had
already
noticed
by
glimpses
,
a
severe
,
dark
,
professorial
outline
,
hovering
aloof
in
an
inner
saloon
,
seen
only
in
vista
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
knew
many
of
the
gentlemen
present
,
but
I
think
was
a
stranger
to
most
of
the
ladies
,
excepting
myself
;
in
looking
towards
the
hearth
,
he
could
not
but
see
me
,
and
naturally
made
a
movement
to
approach
;
seeing
,
however
,
Dr.
Bretton
also
,
he
changed
his
mind
and
held
back
.
<EOS>
If
that
had
been
all
,
there
would
have
been
no
cause
for
quarrel
;
but
not
satisfied
with
holding
back
,
he
puckered
up
his
eyebrows
,
protruded
his
lip
,
and
looked
so
ugly
that
I
averted
my
eyes
from
the
displeasing
spectacle
.
<EOS>
M.
Joseph
Emanuel
had
arrived
,
as
well
as
his
austere
brother
,
and
at
this
very
moment
was
relieving
Ginevra
at
the
piano
.
<EOS>
What
a
master
-
touch
succeeded
her
school
-
girl
jingle
!
<EOS>
In
what
grand
,
grateful
tones
the
instrument
acknowledged
the
hand
of
the
true
artist
!
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
"
began
Dr.
Bretton
,
breaking
silence
and
smiling
,
as
Ginevra
glided
before
him
,
casting
a
glance
as
she
passed
by
,
"
Miss
Fanshawe
is
certainly
a
fine
girl
.
"
  
<EOS>
Of
course
I
assented
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
another
in
the
room
as
lovely
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
is
not
another
as
handsome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
agree
with
you
,
Lucy
:
<EOS>
you
and
I
do
often
agree
in
opinion
,
in
taste
,
I
think
;
or
at
least
in
judgment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
we
?
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
somewhat
doubtfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
if
you
had
been
a
boy
,
Lucy
,
instead
of
a
girl
 
my
mother
's
god
-
son
instead
of
her
god
-
daughter
,
we
should
have
been
good
friends
:
our
opinions
would
have
melted
into
each
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
assumed
a
bantering
air
:
a
light
,
half
-
caressing
,
half
-
ironic
,
shone
aslant
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
Graham
!
<EOS>
I
have
given
more
than
one
solitary
moment
to
thoughts
and
calculations
of
your
estimate
of
Lucy
Snowe
:
was
it
always
kind
or
just
?
<EOS>
Had
Lucy
been
intrinsically
the
same
but
possessing
the
additional
advantages
of
wealth
and
station
,
would
your
manner
to
her
,
your
value
for
her
,
have
been
quite
what
they
actually
were
?
<EOS>
And
yet
by
these
questions
I
would
not
seriously
infer
blame
.
<EOS>
No
;
you
might
sadden
and
trouble
me
sometimes
;
but
then
mine
was
a
soon
-
depressed
,
an
easily
-
deranged
temperament
 
<EOS>
it
fell
if
a
cloud
crossed
the
sun
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
before
the
eye
of
severe
equity
I
should
stand
more
at
fault
than
you
.
  
<EOS>
Trying
,
then
,
to
keep
down
the
unreasonable
pain
which
thrilled
my
heart
,
on
thus
being
made
to
feel
that
while
Graham
could
devote
to
others
the
most
grave
and
earnest
,
the
manliest
interest
,
he
had
no
more
than
light
raillery
for
Lucy
,
the
friend
of
lang
syne
,
I
inquired
calmly
,
 
"
<EOS>
On
what
points
are
we
so
closely
in
accordance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
each
have
an
observant
faculty
.
<EOS>
You
,
perhaps
,
do
n't
give
me
credit
for
the
possession
;
yet
I
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
were
speaking
of
tastes
:
we
may
see
the
same
objects
,
yet
estimate
them
differently
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
bring
it
to
the
test
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
you
can
not
but
render
homage
to
the
merits
of
Miss
Fanshawe
:
now
,
what
do
you
think
of
others
in
the
room
?
 
<EOS>
my
mother
,
for
instance
;
or
the
lions
yonder
,
<EOS>
Messieurs
A
  
and
Z
 
;
or
,
let
us
say
,
that
pale
little
lady
,
Miss
de
Bassompierre
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
I
think
of
your
mother
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
thought
of
Messieurs
A
and
Z
 
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
the
other
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
is
,
as
you
say
,
a
pale
little
lady
 
pale
,
certainly
,
just
now
,
when
she
is
fatigued
with
over
-
excitement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
remember
her
as
a
child
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
,
sometimes
,
whether
you
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
forgotten
her
;
but
it
is
noticeable
,
that
circumstances
,
persons
,
even
words
and
looks
,
that
had
slipped
your
memory
,
may
,
under
certain
conditions
,
certain
aspects
of
your
own
or
another
's
mind
,
revive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
possible
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
,
"
he
continued
,
"
the
revival
is
imperfect
 
needs
confirmation
,
partakes
so
much
of
the
dim
character
of
a
dream
,
or
of
the
airy
one
of
a
fancy
,
that
the
testimony
of
a
witness
becomes
necessary
for
corroboration
.
<EOS>
Were
you
not
a
guest
at
Bretton
ten
years
ago
,
when
Mr.
Home
brought
his
little
girl
,
whom
we
then
called
"
little
Polly
,
"
to
stay
with
mamma
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
there
the
night
she
came
,
and
also
the
morning
she
went
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Rather
a
peculiar
child
,
was
she
not
?
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
I
treated
her
.
<EOS>
Was
I
fond
of
children
in
those
days
?
<EOS>
Was
there
anything
gracious
or
kindly
about
me
 
great
,
reckless
,
schoolboy
as
I
was
?
<EOS>
But
you
do
n't
recollect
me
,
of
course
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
your
own
picture
at
La
Terrasse
.
<EOS>
It
is
like
you
personally
.
<EOS>
In
manner
,
you
were
almost
the
same
yesterday
as
to
-
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Lucy
,
how
is
that
?
<EOS>
Such
an
oracle
really
whets
my
curiosity
.
<EOS>
What
am
I
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
What
was
I
the
yesterday
of
ten
years
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gracious
to
whatever
pleased
you
 
unkindly
or
cruel
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
you
are
wrong
;
I
think
I
was
almost
a
brute
to
_
you
_
,
for
instance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
brute
!
<EOS>
No
,
Graham
:
I
should
never
have
patiently
endured
brutality
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
This
_
,
however
,
I
_
do
_
remember
:
<EOS>
quiet
Lucy
Snowe
tasted
nothing
of
my
grace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
little
of
your
cruelty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
had
I
been
Nero
himself
,
I
could
not
have
tormented
a
being
inoffensive
as
a
shadow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
smiled
;
but
I
also
hushed
a
groan
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
just
wished
he
would
let
me
alone
 
<EOS>
cease
allusion
to
me
.
<EOS>
These
epithets
 
<EOS>
these
attributes
I
put
from
me
.
<EOS>
His
"
quiet
Lucy
Snowe
,
"
his
"
inoffensive
shadow
,
"
I
gave
him
back
;
not
with
scorn
,
but
with
extreme
weariness
:
theirs
was
the
coldness
and
the
pressure
of
lead
;
let
him
whelm
me
with
no
such
weight
.
<EOS>
Happily
,
he
was
soon
on
another
theme
.
  
<EOS>
"
On
what
terms
were
"
little
Polly
"
and
I
?
<EOS>
Unless
my
recollections
deceive
me
,
we
were
not
foes
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
speak
very
vaguely
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
little
Polly
's
memory
,
not
more
definite
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
we
do
n't
talk
of
"
little
Polly
"
_
now
_
.
<EOS>
Pray
say
,
Miss
de
Bassompierre
;
<EOS>
and
,
of
course
,
such
a
stately
personage
remembers
nothing
of
Bretton
.
<EOS>
Look
at
her
large
eyes
,
Lucy
;
can
they
read
a
word
in
the
page
of
memory
?
<EOS>
Are
they
the
same
which
I
used
to
direct
to
a
horn
-
book
?
<EOS>
She
does
not
know
that
I
partly
taught
her
to
read
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
Bible
on
Sunday
nights
?
"
  
"
She
has
a
calm
,
delicate
,
rather
fine
profile
now
:
once
what
a
little
restless
,
anxious
countenance
was
hers
!
<EOS>
What
a
thing
is
a
child
's
preference
 
<EOS>
what
a
bubble
!
<EOS>
Would
you
believe
it
?
<EOS>
that
lady
was
fond
of
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
was
in
some
measure
fond
of
you
,
"
said
I
,
moderately
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
remember
then
?
<EOS>
_
I
_
had
forgotten
;
but
I
remember
_
now
_
.
<EOS>
She
liked
me
the
best
of
whatever
there
was
at
Bretton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
thought
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
quite
well
recall
it
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
tell
her
all
I
recall
;
or
rather
,
I
wish
some
one
,
you
for
instance
,
would
go
behind
and
whisper
it
all
in
her
ear
,
and
I
could
have
the
delight
 
here
,
as
I
sit
 
of
watching
her
look
under
the
intelligence
.
<EOS>
Could
you
manage
that
,
think
you
,
Lucy
,
and
make
me
ever
grateful
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Could
I
manage
to
make
you
ever
grateful
?
"
said
I.
<EOS>
"
No
,
_
<EOS>
I
could
not
_
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
felt
my
fingers
work
and
my
hands
interlock
:
<EOS>
I
felt
,
too
,
an
inward
courage
,
warm
and
resistant
.
<EOS>
In
this
matter
I
was
not
disposed
to
gratify
Dr.
John
:
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
With
now
welcome
force
,
I
realized
his
entire
misapprehension
of
my
character
and
nature
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
always
to
give
me
a
role
not
mine
.
<EOS>
Nature
and
I
opposed
him
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
at
all
guess
what
I
felt
<EOS>
:
he
did
not
read
my
eyes
,
or
face
,
or
gestures
;
though
,
I
doubt
not
,
all
spoke
.
<EOS>
Leaning
towards
me
coaxingly
,
he
said
,
softly
,
"
_
Do
_
content
me
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
I
would
have
contented
,
or
,
at
least
,
I
would
clearly
have
enlightened
him
,
and
taught
him
well
never
again
to
expect
of
me
the
part
of
officious
soubrette
in
a
love
drama
;
when
,
following
his
,
soft
,
eager
,
murmur
,
meeting
almost
his
pleading
,
mellow
 
"
_
<EOS>
Do
_
content
me
,
Lucy
!
"
<EOS>
a
sharp
hiss
pierced
my
ear
on
the
other
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Petite
chatte
,
doucerette
,
coquette
!
"
sibillated
the
sudden
boa
-
constrictor
;
"
vous
avez
l'air
bien
triste
,
soumis
,
rêveur
,
mais
vous
ne
l'êtes
pas
:
<EOS>
c'est
moi
qui
vous
le
dis
:
Sauvage
!
<EOS>
la
flamme
<EOS>
à
l'âme
,
l'éclair
aux
yeux
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oui
;
j'ai
<EOS>
la
flamme
à
l'âme
,
et
je
dois
l'avoir
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
retorted
I
,
turning
in
just
wrath
:
but
Professor
Emanuel
had
hissed
his
insult
and
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
The
worst
of
the
matter
was
,
that
Dr.
Bretton
,
whose
ears
,
as
I
have
said
,
were
quick
and
fine
,
caught
every
word
of
this
apostrophe
;
he
put
his
handkerchief
to
his
face
,
and
laughed
till
he
shook
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
done
,
Lucy
,
"
cried
he
;
"
capital
!
<EOS>
petite
chatte
,
petite
coquette
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
must
tell
my
mother
!
<EOS>
Is
it
true
,
Lucy
,
or
half
-
true
?
<EOS>
I
believe
it
is
:
you
redden
to
the
colour
of
Miss
Fanshawe
's
gown
.
<EOS>
And
really
,
by
my
word
,
now
I
examine
him
,
that
is
the
same
little
man
who
was
so
savage
with
you
at
the
concert
:
the
very
same
,
and
in
his
soul
he
is
frantic
at
this
moment
because
he
sees
me
laughing
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
must
tease
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
Graham
,
yielding
to
his
bent
for
mischief
,
laughed
,
jested
,
and
whispered
on
till
I
could
bear
no
more
,
and
my
eyes
filled
.
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
was
sobered
:
a
vacant
space
appeared
near
Miss
de
Bassompierre
;
the
circle
surrounding
her
seemed
about
to
dissolve
.
<EOS>
This
movement
was
instantly
caught
by
Graham
's
eye
 
ever
-
vigilant
,
even
while
laughing
;
he
rose
,
took
his
courage
in
both
hands
,
crossed
the
room
,
and
made
the
advantage
his
own
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
,
throughout
his
whole
life
,
was
a
man
of
luck
 
<EOS>
a
man
of
success
.
<EOS>
And
why
?
<EOS>
Because
he
had
the
eye
to
see
his
opportunity
,
the
heart
to
prompt
to
well
-
timed
action
,
the
nerve
to
consummate
a
perfect
work
.
<EOS>
And
no
tyrant
-
passion
dragged
him
back
;
no
enthusiasms
,
no
foibles
encumbered
his
way
.
<EOS>
How
well
he
looked
at
this
very
moment
!
<EOS>
When
Paulina
looked
up
as
he
reached
her
side
,
her
glance
mingled
at
once
with
an
encountering
glance
,
animated
,
yet
modest
;
his
colour
,
as
he
spoke
to
her
,
became
half
a
blush
,
half
a
glow
.
<EOS>
He
stood
in
her
presence
brave
and
bashful
:
subdued
and
unobtrusive
,
yet
decided
in
his
purpose
and
devoted
in
his
ardour
.
<EOS>
I
gathered
all
this
by
one
view
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
prolong
my
observation
 
time
failed
me
,
had
inclination
served
:
<EOS>
the
night
wore
late
;
Ginevra
and
I
ought
already
to
have
been
in
the
Rue
Fossette
.
<EOS>
I
rose
,
and
bade
good
-
night
to
my
godmother
and
M.
de
Bassompierre
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
Professor
Emanuel
had
noticed
my
reluctant
acceptance
of
Dr.
Bretton
's
badinage
,
or
whether
he
perceived
that
I
was
pained
,
and
that
,
on
the
whole
,
the
evening
had
not
been
one
flow
of
exultant
enjoyment
for
the
volatile
,
pleasure
-
loving
Mademoiselle
Lucie
;
but
,
as
I
was
leaving
the
room
,
he
stepped
up
and
inquired
whether
I
had
any
one
to
attend
me
to
the
Rue
Fossette
.
<EOS>
The
professor
_
now
_
spoke
politely
,
and
even
deferentially
,
and
he
looked
apologetic
and
repentant
;
but
I
could
not
recognise
his
civility
at
a
word
,
nor
meet
his
contrition
with
crude
,
premature
oblivion
.
<EOS>
Never
hitherto
had
<EOS>
I
felt
seriously
disposed
to
resent
his
brusqueries
,
or
freeze
before
his
fierceness
;
what
he
had
said
to
-
night
<EOS>
,
however
,
I
considered
unwarranted
:
my
extreme
disapprobation
of
the
proceeding
must
be
marked
,
however
slightly
.
<EOS>
I
merely
said
:
 
"
I
am
provided
with
attendance
.
"
  
<EOS>
Which
was
true
,
as
Ginevra
and
I
were
to
be
sent
home
in
the
carriage
;
and
I
passed
him
with
the
sliding
obeisance
with
which
he
was
wo
nt
to
be
saluted
in
classe
by
pupils
crossing
his
estrade
.
  
<EOS>
Having
sought
my
shawl
,
I
returned
to
the
vestibule
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
stood
there
as
if
waiting
.
<EOS>
He
observed
that
the
night
was
fine
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
with
a
tone
and
manner
whose
consummate
chariness
and
frostiness
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
applaud
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
seldom
<EOS>
I
could
properly
act
out
my
own
resolution
to
be
reserved
and
cool
where
I
had
been
grieved
or
hurt
,
that
I
felt
almost
proud
of
this
one
successful
effort
.
<EOS>
That
"
Is
it
?
"
<EOS>
sounded
just
like
the
manner
of
other
people
.
<EOS>
I
had
heard
hundreds
of
such
little
minced
,
docked
,
dry
phrases
,
from
the
pursed
-
up
coral
lips
of
a
score
of
self
-
possessed
,
self
-
sufficing
misses
and
mesdemoiselles
.
<EOS>
That
M.
Paul
would
not
stand
any
prolonged
experience
of
this
sort
of
dialogue
I
knew
;
but
he
certainly
merited
a
sample
of
the
curt
and
arid
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
thought
so
himself
,
for
he
took
the
dose
quietly
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
my
shawl
and
objected
to
its
lightness
.
<EOS>
I
decidedly
told
him
it
was
as
heavy
as
I
wished
.
<EOS>
Receding
aloof
,
and
standing
apart
,
I
leaned
on
the
banister
of
the
stairs
,
folded
my
shawl
about
me
,
and
fixed
my
eyes
on
a
dreary
religious
painting
darkening
the
wall
.
  
<EOS>
Ginevra
was
long
in
coming
:
tedious
seemed
her
loitering
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
was
still
there
;
my
ear
expected
from
his
lips
an
angry
tone
.
<EOS>
He
came
nearer
.
"
<EOS>
Now
for
another
hiss
!
"
<EOS>
thought
I
:
had
not
the
action
been
too
uncivil
<EOS>
I
could
have
,
stopped
my
ears
with
my
fingers
in
terror
of
the
thrill
.
<EOS>
Nothing
happens
as
we
expect
:
listen
for
a
coo
or
a
murmur
;
it
is
then
you
will
hear
a
cry
of
prey
or
pain
.
<EOS>
Await
a
piercing
shriek
,
an
angry
threat
,
and
welcome
an
amicable
greeting
,
a
low
kind
whisper
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
spoke
gently
:
 
"
Friends
,
"
said
he
,
"
do
not
quarrel
for
a
word
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
was
it
I
or
ce
grand
fat
d'Anglais
"
<EOS>
(
so
he
profanely
denominated
Dr.
Bretton
)
,
"
who
made
your
eyes
so
humid
,
and
your
cheeks
so
hot
as
they
are
even
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
conscious
of
you
,
monsieur
,
or
of
any
other
having
excited
such
emotion
as
you
indicate
,
"
was
my
answer
;
and
in
giving
it
,
I
again
surpassed
my
usual
self
,
and
achieved
a
neat
,
frosty
falsehood
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
did
I
say
?
<EOS>
"
he
pursued
;
"
tell
me
:
<EOS>
I
was
angry
:
I
have
forgotten
my
words
;
what
were
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
as
it
is
best
to
forget
!
"
said
I
,
still
quite
calm
and
chill
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
was
_
<EOS>
my
_
words
which
wounded
you
?
<EOS>
Consider
them
unsaid
:
permit
my
retractation
;
accord
my
pardon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
angry
,
Monsieur
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
worse
than
angry
 
grieved
.
<EOS>
Forgive
me
,
Miss
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
M.
Emanuel
,
I
_
do
_
forgive
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
hear
you
say
,
in
the
voice
natural
to
you
,
and
not
in
that
alien
tone
,
"
Mon
ami
,
je
vous
pardonne
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
made
me
smile
.
<EOS>
Who
could
help
smiling
at
his
wistfulness
,
his
simplicity
,
his
earnestness
?
  
<EOS>
"
Bon
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Voilà
que
le
jour
va
poindre
!
<EOS>
Dites
donc
,
mon
ami
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
Paul
,
je
vous
pardonne
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
no
monsieur
:
speak
the
other
word
,
or
I
shall
not
believe
you
sincere
:
<EOS>
another
effort
 
_
mon
ami
_
,
or
else
in
English
,
 
my
friend
!
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
"
my
friend
"
had
rather
another
sound
and
significancy
than
"
_
mon
ami
_
;
"
it
did
not
breathe
the
same
sense
of
domestic
and
intimate
affection
;
"
_
mon
ami
_
<EOS>
"
I
could
_
not
_
say
to
M.
Paul
;
"
my
friend
,
"
I
could
,
and
did
say
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
This
distinction
existed
not
for
him
,
however
,
and
he
was
quite
satisfied
with
the
English
phrase
.
<EOS>
He
smiled
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
seen
him
smile
,
reader
;
and
you
should
have
marked
the
difference
between
his
countenance
now
,
and
that
he
wore
half
an
hour
ago
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
affirm
that
I
had
ever
witnessed
the
smile
of
pleasure
,
or
content
,
or
kindness
round
M.
Paul
's
lips
,
or
in
his
eyes
before
.
<EOS>
The
ironic
,
the
sarcastic
,
the
disdainful
,
the
passionately
exultant
<EOS>
,
I
had
hundreds
of
times
seen
him
express
by
what
he
called
a
smile
,
but
any
illuminated
sign
of
milder
or
warmer
feelings
struck
me
as
wholly
new
in
his
visage
.
<EOS>
It
changed
it
as
from
a
mask
to
a
face
:
the
deep
lines
left
his
features
;
the
very
complexion
seemed
clearer
and
fresher
;
that
swart
,
sallow
,
southern
darkness
which
spoke
his
Spanish
blood
,
became
displaced
by
a
lighter
hue
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
that
I
have
ever
seen
in
any
other
human
face
an
equal
metamorphosis
from
a
similar
cause
.
<EOS>
He
now
took
me
to
the
carriage
:
at
the
same
moment
M.
de
Bassompierre
came
out
with
his
niece
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
pretty
humour
was
Mistress
Fanshawe
;
she
had
found
the
evening
a
grand
failure
:
completely
upset
as
to
temper
,
she
gave
way
to
the
most
uncontrolled
moroseness
as
soon
as
we
were
seated
,
and
the
carriage
-
door
closed
.
<EOS>
Her
invectives
against
Dr.
Bretton
had
something
venomous
in
them
.
<EOS>
Having
found
herself
impotent
either
to
charm
or
sting
him
,
hatred
was
her
only
resource
;
and
this
hatred
she
expressed
in
terms
so
unmeasured
and
proportion
so
monstrous
,
<EOS>
that
,
after
listening
for
a
while
with
assumed
stoicism
,
my
outraged
sense
of
justice
at
last
and
suddenly
caught
fire
.
<EOS>
An
explosion
ensued
:
for
I
could
be
passionate
,
too
;
especially
with
my
present
fair
but
faulty
associate
,
who
never
failed
to
stir
the
worst
dregs
of
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
that
the
carriage
-
wheels
made
a
tremendous
rattle
over
the
flinty
Choseville
pavement
,
for
I
can
assure
the
reader
there
was
neither
dead
silence
nor
calm
discussion
within
the
vehicle
.
<EOS>
Half
in
earnest
,
half
in
seeming
,
I
made
it
my
business
to
storm
down
Ginevra
.
<EOS>
She
had
set
out
rampant
from
the
Rue
Crécy
;
it
was
necessary
to
tame
her
before
we
reached
the
Rue
Fossette
:
to
this
end
it
was
indispensable
to
show
up
her
sterling
value
and
high
deserts
;
and
this
must
be
done
in
language
of
which
the
fidelity
and
homeliness
might
challenge
comparison
with
the
compliments
of
a
John
Knox
to
a
Mary
Stuart
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
right
discipline
for
Ginevra
;
it
suited
her
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
sure
she
went
to
bed
that
night
all
the
better
and
more
settled
in
mind
and
mood
,
and
slept
all
the
more
sweetly
for
having
undergone
a
sound
moral
drubbing
.
    
<EOS>
THE
WATCHGUARD
.
  
<EOS>
M.
Paul
Emanuel
owned
an
acute
sensitiveness
to
the
annoyance
of
interruption
,
from
whatsoever
cause
occurring
,
during
his
lessons
:
to
pass
through
the
classe
under
such
circumstances
was
considered
by
the
teachers
and
pupils
of
the
school
,
individually
and
collectively
,
to
be
as
much
as
a
woman
's
or
girl
's
life
was
worth
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
herself
,
if
forced
to
the
enterprise
,
would
"
skurry
"
through
,
retrenching
her
skirts
,
and
carefully
coasting
the
formidable
estrade
,
like
a
ship
dreading
breakers
.
<EOS>
As
to
Rosine
,
the
portress
 
on
whom
,
every
half
-
hour
,
devolved
the
fearful
duty
of
fetching
pupils
out
of
the
very
heart
of
one
or
other
of
the
divisions
to
take
their
music
-
lessons
in
the
oratory
,
the
great
or
little
saloon
,
the
salle
-
à
-
manger
,
or
some
other
piano
-
station
 
she
would
,
upon
her
second
or
third
attempt
,
frequently
become
almost
tongue
-
tied
from
excess
of
consternation
 
a
sentiment
inspired
by
the
unspeakable
looks
levelled
at
her
through
a
pair
of
dart
-
dealing
spectacles
.
  
<EOS>
One
morning
I
was
sitting
in
the
carré
,
at
work
upon
a
piece
of
embroidery
which
one
of
the
pupils
had
commenced
but
delayed
to
finish
,
and
while
my
fingers
wrought
at
the
frame
,
my
ears
regaled
themselves
with
listening
to
the
crescendos
and
cadences
of
a
voice
haranguing
in
the
neighbouring
classe
,
in
tones
that
waxed
momentarily
more
unquiet
,
more
ominously
varied
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
good
strong
partition
-
wall
between
me
and
the
gathering
storm
,
as
well
as
a
facile
means
of
flight
through
the
glass
-
door
to
the
court
,
in
case
it
swept
this
way
;
so
I
am
afraid
I
derived
more
amusement
than
alarm
from
these
thickening
symptoms
.
<EOS>
Poor
Rosine
was
not
safe
:
four
times
that
blessed
morning
<EOS>
had
she
made
the
passage
of
peril
;
and
now
,
for
the
fifth
time
,
it
became
her
dangerous
duty
to
snatch
,
as
it
were
,
a
brand
from
the
burning
 
a
pupil
from
under
M.
Paul
's
nose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mon
Dieu
!
<EOS>
Mon
Dieu
!
"
cried
she
.
"
<EOS>
Que
vais
-
je
devenir
?
<EOS>
Monsieur
va
<EOS>
me
tuer
,
je
suis
sûre
;
car
il
est
d'une
colère
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Nerved
by
the
courage
of
desperation
,
she
opened
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
La
Malle
au
piano
!
<EOS>
"
was
her
cry
.
  
<EOS>
Ere
she
could
make
good
her
retreat
,
or
quite
close
the
door
,
this
voice
uttered
itself
:
    
"
Dès
ce
moment
!
 
<EOS>
la
classe
est
défendue
.
<EOS>
La
première
qui
ouvrira
cette
porte
,
ou
passera
par
cette
division
,
<EOS>
sera
pendue
 
fut
-
ce
Madame
Beck
elle
-
même
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Ten
minutes
had
not
succeeded
the
promulgation
of
this
decree
when
Rosine
's
French
pantoufles
were
again
heard
shuffling
along
the
corridor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
would
not
for
a
five
-
franc
piece
go
into
that
classe
again
just
now
:
Monsieur
's
lunettes
are
really
terrible
;
and
here
is
a
commissionaire
come
with
a
message
from
the
Athénée
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
Madame
Beck
I
dare
not
deliver
it
,
and
she
says
I
am
to
charge
you
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Me
?
<EOS>
No
,
that
is
rather
too
bad
!
<EOS>
It
is
not
in
my
line
of
duty
.
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
Rosine
!
<EOS>
bear
your
own
burden
.
<EOS>
Be
brave
 
charge
once
more
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
,
Mademoiselle
?
 
impossible
!
<EOS>
Five
times
I
have
crossed
him
this
day
.
<EOS>
Madame
must
really
hire
a
gendarme
for
this
service
.
<EOS>
Ouf
!
<EOS>
Je
<EOS>
n'en
puis
plus
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
<EOS>
you
are
only
a
coward
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
message
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Precisely
of
the
kind
with
which
Monsieur
least
likes
to
be
pestered
:
an
urgent
summons
to
go
directly
to
the
Athénée
,
as
there
is
an
official
visitor
 
inspector
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
 
arrived
,
and
Monsieur
_
must
_
meet
him
<EOS>
:
you
know
how
he
hates
a
_
<EOS>
must
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
knew
well
enough
.
<EOS>
The
restive
little
man
detested
spur
or
curb
:
against
whatever
was
urgent
or
obligatory
,
he
was
sure
to
revolt
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
accepted
the
responsibility
 
not
,
certainly
,
without
fear
,
but
fear
blent
with
other
sentiments
,
curiosity
,
amongst
them
.
<EOS>
I
opened
the
door
,
I
entered
<EOS>
,
I
closed
it
behind
me
as
quickly
and
quietly
as
a
rather
unsteady
hand
would
permit
;
for
to
be
slow
or
bustling
,
to
rattle
a
latch
,
or
leave
a
door
gaping
wide
,
were
aggravations
of
crime
often
more
disastrous
in
result
than
the
main
crime
itself
.
<EOS>
There
I
stood
then
,
and
there
he
sat
;
his
humour
was
visibly
bad
 
<EOS>
almost
at
its
worst
;
he
had
been
giving
a
lesson
in
arithmetic
 
for
he
gave
lessons
on
any
and
every
subject
that
struck
his
fancy
 
and
arithmetic
being
a
dry
subject
,
invariably
disagreed
with
him
:
not
a
pupil
but
trembled
when
he
spoke
of
figures
.
<EOS>
He
sat
,
bent
above
his
desk
:
to
look
up
at
the
sound
of
an
entrance
,
at
the
occurrence
of
a
direct
breach
of
his
will
and
law
,
was
an
effort
he
could
not
for
the
moment
bring
himself
to
make
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
as
well
:
I
thus
gained
time
to
walk
up
the
long
classe
;
and
it
suited
my
idiosyncracy
far
better
to
encounter
the
near
burst
of
anger
like
his
,
than
to
bear
its
menace
at
a
distance
.
  
<EOS>
At
his
estrade
I
paused
,
just
in
front
;
of
course
I
was
not
worthy
of
immediate
attention
:
he
proceeded
with
his
lesson
.
<EOS>
Disdain
would
not
do
:
he
must
hear
and
he
must
answer
my
message
.
  
<EOS>
Not
being
quite
tall
enough
to
lift
my
head
over
his
desk
,
elevated
upon
the
estrade
,
and
thus
suffering
eclipse
in
my
present
position
,
I
ventured
to
peep
round
,
with
the
design
,
at
first
,
of
merely
getting
a
better
view
of
his
face
,
which
had
struck
me
when
I
entered
as
bearing
a
close
and
picturesque
resemblance
to
that
of
a
black
and
sallow
tiger
.
<EOS>
Twice
did
I
enjoy
this
side
-
view
with
impunity
,
advancing
and
receding
unseen
;
the
third
time
my
eye
had
scarce
dawned
beyond
the
obscuration
of
the
desk
,
when
it
was
caught
and
transfixed
through
its
very
pupil
 
transfixed
by
the
"
lunettes
.
<EOS>
"
Rosine
was
right
;
these
utensils
had
in
them
a
blank
and
immutable
terror
,
beyond
the
mobile
wrath
of
the
wearer
's
own
unglazed
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
found
the
advantage
of
proximity
:
these
short
-
sighted
"
lunettes
"
were
useless
for
the
inspection
of
a
criminal
under
Monsieur
's
nose
;
accordingly
,
he
doffed
them
,
and
he
and
I
stood
on
more
equal
terms
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
glad
I
was
not
really
much
afraid
of
him
 
<EOS>
that
,
indeed
,
close
in
his
presence
,
I
felt
no
terror
at
all
;
for
upon
his
demanding
cord
and
gibbet
to
execute
the
sentence
recently
pronounced
,
I
was
able
to
furnish
him
with
a
needleful
of
embroidering
thread
with
such
accommodating
civility
as
could
not
but
allay
some
portion
at
least
of
his
surplus
irritation
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
did
not
parade
this
courtesy
before
public
view
:
I
merely
handed
the
thread
round
the
angle
of
the
desk
,
and
attached
it
,
ready
noosed
,
to
the
barred
back
of
the
Professor
's
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Que
me
voulez
-
vous
?
"
said
he
in
a
growl
of
which
the
music
was
wholly
confined
to
his
chest
and
throat
,
for
he
kept
his
teeth
clenched
;
and
seemed
registering
to
himself
an
inward
vow
that
nothing
earthly
should
wring
from
him
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
My
answer
commenced
uncompromisingly
:
"
Monsieur
,
"
I
said
,
"
je
veux
l'impossible
,
des
choses
inouïes
;
"
and
thinking
it
best
not
to
mince
matters
,
but
to
administer
the
"
douche
"
with
decision
,
in
a
low
but
quick
voice
,
I
delivered
the
Athenian
message
,
floridly
exaggerating
its
urgency
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
,
he
would
not
hear
a
word
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
He
would
not
go
;
he
would
not
leave
his
present
class
,
let
all
the
officials
of
Villette
send
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
put
himself
an
inch
out
of
his
way
at
the
bidding
of
king
,
cabinet
,
and
chambers
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
knew
,
however
,
that
he
_
must
_
go
;
that
,
talk
as
he
would
,
both
his
duty
and
interest
commanded
an
immediate
and
literal
compliance
with
the
summons
:
I
stood
,
therefore
,
waiting
in
silence
,
as
if
he
had
not
yet
spoken
.
<EOS>
He
asked
what
more
I
wanted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
Monsieur
's
answer
to
deliver
to
the
commissionaire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
waved
an
impatient
negative
.
  
<EOS>
I
ventured
to
stretch
my
hand
to
the
bonnet
-
grec
which
lay
in
grim
repose
on
the
window
-
sill
.
<EOS>
He
followed
this
daring
movement
with
his
eye
,
no
doubt
in
mixed
pity
and
amazement
at
its
presumption
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
muttered
,
"
if
it
came
to
that
 
if
Miss
Lucy
meddled
with
his
bonnet
-
grec
 
<EOS>
she
might
just
put
it
on
herself
,
turn
garçon
for
the
occasion
,
and
benevolently
go
to
the
Athénée
in
his
stead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
great
respect
,
I
laid
the
bonnet
on
the
desk
,
where
its
tassel
seemed
to
give
me
an
awful
nod
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
write
a
note
of
apology
 
that
will
do
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
still
bent
on
evasion
.
  
<EOS>
Knowing
<EOS>
well
it
would
_
not
_
do
,
I
gently
pushed
the
bonnet
towards
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Thus
impelled
,
it
slid
down
the
polished
slope
of
the
varnished
and
unbaized
desk
,
carried
before
it
the
light
steel
-
framed
"
lunettes
,
"
and
,
fearful
to
relate
,
they
fell
to
the
estrade
.
<EOS>
A
score
of
times
ere
now
had
I
seen
them
fall
and
receive
no
damage
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
this
_
time
,
as
Lucy
Snowe
's
hapless
luck
would
have
it
,
they
so
fell
that
each
clear
pebble
became
a
shivered
and
shapeless
star
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
indeed
,
dismay
seized
me
 
dismay
and
regret
.
<EOS>
I
knew
the
value
of
these
"
lunettes
"
:
<EOS>
M.
Paul
's
sight
was
peculiar
,
not
easily
fitted
,
and
these
glasses
suited
him
.
<EOS>
I
had
heard
him
call
them
his
treasures
:
as
I
picked
them
up
,
cracked
and
worthless
,
my
hand
trembled
.
<EOS>
Frightened
through
all
my
nerves
I
was
to
see
the
mischief
I
had
done
,
but
I
think
I
was
even
more
sorry
than
afraid
.
<EOS>
For
some
seconds
I
dared
not
look
the
bereaved
Professor
in
the
face
;
he
was
the
first
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Là
!
"
said
he
:
"
me
voilà
veuf
de
mes
lunettes
!
<EOS>
I
think
Mademoiselle
Lucy
will
now
confess
that
the
cord
and
gallows
are
amply
earned
;
she
trembles
in
anticipation
of
her
doom
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
traitress
!
<EOS>
traitress
!
<EOS>
You
are
resolved
to
have
me
quite
blind
and
helpless
in
your
hands
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
lifted
my
eyes
:
<EOS>
his
face
,
instead
of
being
irate
,
lowering
,
and
furrowed
,
was
overflowing
with
the
smile
,
coloured
with
the
bloom
I
had
seen
brightening
it
that
evening
at
the
Hotel
Crécy
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
angry
 
not
even
grieved
.
<EOS>
For
the
real
injury
he
showed
himself
full
of
clemency
;
under
the
real
provocation
,
patient
as
a
saint
.
<EOS>
This
event
,
which
seemed
so
untoward
 
which
I
thought
had
ruined
at
once
my
chance
of
successful
persuasion
 
proved
my
best
help
.
<EOS>
Difficult
of
management
so
long
as
I
had
done
him
no
harm
,
he
became
graciously
pliant
as
soon
as
I
stood
in
his
presence
a
conscious
and
contrite
offender
.
  
<EOS>
Still
gently
railing
at
me
as
"
une
forte
femme
 
<EOS>
une
Anglaise
<EOS>
terrible
 
une
petite
casse
-
tout
"
 
<EOS>
he
declared
that
he
dared
not
but
obey
one
who
had
given
such
an
instance
of
her
dangerous
prowess
;
it
was
absolutely
like
the
"
grand
Empereur
smashing
the
vase
to
inspire
dismay
.
"
<EOS>
So
,
at
last
,
crowning
himself
with
his
bonnet
-
grec
,
and
taking
his
ruined
"
lunettes
"
from
my
hand
with
a
clasp
of
kind
pardon
and
encouragement
,
he
made
his
bow
,
and
went
off
to
the
Athénée
in
first
-
rate
humour
and
spirits
.
     
<EOS>
After
all
this
amiability
,
the
reader
will
be
sorry
for
my
sake
to
hear
that
I
was
quarrelling
with
M.
Paul
again
before
night
;
yet
so
it
was
,
and
I
could
not
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
his
occasional
custom
 
and
a
very
laudable
,
acceptable
custom
,
too
 
to
arrive
of
an
evening
,
always
à
l'improviste
,
unannounced
<EOS>
,
burst
in
on
the
silent
hour
of
study
,
establish
a
sudden
despotism
over
us
and
our
occupations
,
cause
books
to
be
put
away
,
work
-
bags
to
be
brought
out
,
and
,
drawing
forth
a
single
thick
volume
,
or
a
handful
of
pamphlets
,
substitute
for
the
besotted
"
lecture
pieuse
,
"
drawled
by
a
sleepy
pupil
,
some
tragedy
made
grand
by
grand
reading
,
ardent
by
fiery
action
 
<EOS>
some
drama
,
whereof
,
for
my
part
,
I
rarely
studied
the
intrinsic
merit
;
for
M.
Emanuel
made
it
a
vessel
for
an
outpouring
,
and
filled
it
with
his
native
verve
and
passion
like
a
cup
with
a
vital
brewage
.
<EOS>
Or
else
he
would
flash
through
our
conventual
darkness
a
reflex
of
a
brighter
world
,
show
us
a
glimpse
of
the
current
literature
of
the
day
,
read
us
passages
from
some
enchanting
tale
,
or
the
last
witty
feuilleton
which
had
awakened
laughter
in
the
saloons
of
Paris
;
taking
care
always
to
expunge
,
with
the
severest
hand
,
whether
from
tragedy
,
melodrama
,
tale
,
or
essay
,
whatever
passage
,
phrase
,
or
word
,
could
be
deemed
unsuited
to
an
audience
of
"
jeunes
filles
.
<EOS>
"
I
noticed
more
than
once
,
that
where
retrenchment
without
substitute
would
have
left
unmeaning
vacancy
,
or
introduced
weakness
,
he
could
,
and
did
,
improvise
whole
paragraphs
,
no
less
vigorous
than
irreproachable
;
the
dialogue
 
<EOS>
the
description
 
he
engrafted
was
often
far
better
than
that
he
pruned
away
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
on
the
evening
in
question
,
we
were
sitting
silent
as
nuns
in
a
"
retreat
,
"
the
pupils
studying
,
the
teachers
working
.
<EOS>
I
remember
my
work
;
it
was
a
slight
matter
of
fancy
,
and
it
rather
interested
me
;
it
had
a
purpose
;
I
was
not
doing
it
merely
to
kill
time
;
I
meant
it
when
finished
as
a
gift
;
and
the
occasion
of
presentation
being
near
,
haste
was
requisite
,
and
my
fingers
were
busy
.
  
<EOS>
We
heard
the
sharp
bell
-
peal
which
we
all
knew
;
then
the
rapid
step
familiar
to
each
ear
:
the
words
"
Voilà
Monsieur
!
"
<EOS>
had
scarcely
broken
simultaneously
from
every
lip
,
when
the
two
-
leaved
door
split
(
as
split
it
always
did
for
his
admission
 
such
a
slow
word
as
"
open
"
is
inefficient
to
describe
his
movements
)
,
and
he
stood
in
the
midst
of
us
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
two
study
tables
,
both
long
and
flanked
with
benches
;
over
the
centre
of
each
hung
a
lamp
;
beneath
this
lamp
,
on
either
side
the
table
,
sat
a
teacher
;
the
girls
were
arranged
to
the
right
hand
and
the
left
;
the
eldest
and
most
studious
nearest
the
lamps
or
tropics
;
the
idlers
and
little
ones
towards
the
north
and
south
poles
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
's
habit
was
politely
to
hand
a
chair
to
some
teacher
,
generally
Zélie
St.
Pierre
,
the
senior
mistress
;
then
to
take
her
vacated
seat
;
and
thus
avail
himself
of
the
full
beam
of
Cancer
or
Capricorn
,
which
,
owing
to
his
near
sight
,
he
needed
.
  
<EOS>
As
usual
,
Zélie
rose
with
alacrity
,
smiling
to
the
whole
extent
of
her
mouth
,
and
the
full
display
of
her
upper
and
under
rows
of
teeth
 
that
strange
smile
which
passes
from
ear
to
ear
,
and
is
marked
only
by
a
sharp
thin
curve
,
which
fails
to
spread
over
the
countenance
,
and
neither
dimples
the
cheek
nor
lights
the
eye
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Monsieur
did
not
see
her
,
or
he
had
taken
a
whim
that
he
would
not
notice
her
,
for
he
was
as
capricious
as
women
are
said
to
be
;
then
his
"
lunettes
"
(
he
had
got
another
pair
)
served
him
as
an
excuse
for
all
sorts
of
little
oversights
and
shortcomings
.
<EOS>
Whatever
might
be
his
reason
,
he
passed
by
Zélie
,
came
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
,
and
before
I
could
start
up
to
clear
the
way
,
whispered
,
"
<EOS>
Ne
bougez
pas
,
"
and
established
himself
between
me
and
Miss
Fanshawe
,
who
always
would
be
my
neighbour
,
and
have
her
elbow
in
my
side
<EOS>
,
however
often
I
declared
to
her
,
"
Ginevra
,
I
wish
you
were
at
Jericho
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
easy
to
say
,
"
Ne
bougez
pas
;
"
but
how
could
I
help
it
?
<EOS>
I
must
make
him
room
,
and
I
must
request
the
pupils
to
recede
that
_
I
_
might
recede
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
well
for
Ginevra
to
be
gummed
to
me
,
"
keeping
herself
warm
,
"
as
she
said
,
on
the
winter
evenings
,
and
harassing
my
very
heart
with
her
fidgetings
and
pokings
,
obliging
me
,
indeed
,
sometimes
to
put
an
artful
pin
in
my
girdle
by
way
of
protection
against
her
elbow
;
but
I
suppose
M.
Emanuel
was
not
to
be
subjected
to
the
same
kind
of
treatment
,
so
I
swept
away
my
working
materials
,
to
clear
space
for
his
book
,
and
withdrew
myself
to
make
room
for
his
person
;
not
,
however
,
leaving
more
than
a
yard
of
interval
,
just
what
any
reasonable
man
would
have
regarded
as
a
convenient
,
respectful
allowance
of
bench
.
<EOS>
But
M.
Emanuel
never
_
was
_
reasonable
;
flint
and
tinder
that
he
was
!
<EOS>
he
struck
and
took
fire
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Vous
ne
voulez
pas
de
moi
pour
voisin
,
"
he
growled
:
"
vous
vous
donnez
des
airs
de
caste
;
vous
me
traitez
en
paria
;
"
he
scowled
.
"
<EOS>
Soit
!
<EOS>
je
<EOS>
vais
arranger
la
chose
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
set
to
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
Levez
vous
toutes
,
Mesdemoiselles
!
"
cried
he
.
  
<EOS>
The
girls
rose
.
<EOS>
He
made
them
all
file
off
to
the
other
table
.
<EOS>
He
then
placed
me
at
one
extremity
of
the
long
bench
,
and
having
duly
and
carefully
brought
me
my
work
-
basket
,
silk
,
scissors
,
all
my
implements
,
he
fixed
himself
quite
at
the
other
end
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
arrangement
,
highly
absurd
as
it
was
,
not
a
soul
in
the
room
dared
to
laugh
;
luckless
for
the
giggler
would
have
been
the
giggle
.
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
I
took
it
with
entire
coolness
.
<EOS>
There
I
sat
,
isolated
and
cut
off
from
human
intercourse
;
I
sat
and
minded
my
work
,
and
was
quiet
,
and
not
at
all
unhappy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Est
ce
assez
de
distance
?
<EOS>
"
he
demanded
.
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
en
est
l'arbitre
,
"
said
I.
  
"
Vous
savez
bien
que
non
.
<EOS>
C'est
vous
qui
avez
crée
ce
vide
immense
:
moi
je
n'y
ai
pas
mis
<EOS>
la
main
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
with
this
assertion
he
commenced
the
reading
.
  
<EOS>
For
his
misfortune
he
had
chosen
a
French
translation
of
what
he
called
"
un
drame
de
Williams
Shackspire
;
le
faux
dieu
,
"
he
further
announced
,
"
de
ces
sots
païens
,
les
Anglais
.
<EOS>
"
How
far
otherwise
he
would
have
characterized
him
had
his
temper
not
been
upset
,
I
scarcely
need
intimate
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
,
the
translation
being
French
,
was
very
inefficient
;
nor
did
I
make
any
particular
effort
to
conceal
the
contempt
which
some
of
its
forlorn
lapses
were
calculated
to
excite
.
<EOS>
Not
that
it
behoved
or
beseemed
me
to
say
anything
:
but
one
can
occasionally
_
look
_
<EOS>
the
opinion
it
is
forbidden
to
embody
in
words
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
's
lunettes
being
on
the
alert
,
he
gleaned
up
every
stray
look
;
I
do
n't
think
he
lost
one
:
the
consequence
was
,
his
eyes
soon
discarded
a
screen
,
that
their
blaze
might
sparkle
free
,
and
he
waxed
hotter
at
the
north
pole
to
which
he
had
voluntarily
exiled
himself
,
than
,
considering
the
general
temperature
of
the
room
<EOS>
,
it
would
have
been
reasonable
to
become
under
the
vertical
ray
of
Cancer
itself
.
  
<EOS>
The
reading
over
,
it
appeared
problematic
whether
he
would
depart
with
his
anger
unexpressed
,
or
whether
he
would
give
it
vent
.
<EOS>
Suppression
was
not
much
in
his
habits
;
but
still
,
what
had
been
done
to
him
definite
enough
to
afford
matter
for
overt
reproof
?
<EOS>
I
had
not
uttered
a
sound
,
and
could
not
justly
be
deemed
amenable
to
reprimand
or
penalty
for
having
permitted
a
slightly
freer
action
than
usual
to
the
muscles
about
my
eyes
and
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
The
supper
,
consisting
of
bread
,
and
milk
diluted
with
tepid
water
,
was
brought
in
.
<EOS>
In
respectful
consideration
of
the
Professor
's
presence
,
the
rolls
and
glasses
were
allowed
to
stand
instead
of
being
immediately
handed
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
your
supper
,
ladies
,
"
said
he
,
seeming
to
be
occupied
in
making
marginal
notes
to
his
"
Williams
Shackspire
.
<EOS>
"
They
took
it
.
<EOS>
I
also
accepted
a
roll
and
glass
,
but
being
now
more
than
ever
interested
in
my
work
,
I
kept
my
seat
of
punishment
,
and
wrought
while
I
munched
my
bread
and
sipped
my
beverage
,
the
whole
with
easy
_
sang
-
froid
_
;
with
a
certain
snugness
of
composure
,
indeed
,
scarcely
in
my
habits
,
and
pleasantly
novel
to
my
feelings
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
the
presence
of
a
nature
so
restless
,
chafing
,
thorny
as
that
of
M.
Paul
absorbed
all
feverish
and
unsettling
influences
like
a
magnet
,
and
left
me
none
but
such
as
were
placid
and
harmonious
.
  
<EOS>
He
rose
.
<EOS>
"
Will
he
go
away
without
saying
another
word
?
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
he
turned
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
:
he
_
re_-turned
on
his
steps
;
but
only
,
perhaps
,
to
take
his
pencil
-
case
,
which
had
been
left
on
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
it
 
shut
the
pencil
in
and
out
,
broke
its
point
against
the
wood
,
re
-
cut
and
pocketed
it
,
and
.
.
.
<EOS>
walked
promptly
up
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
girls
and
teachers
,
gathered
round
the
other
table
,
were
talking
pretty
freely
:
they
always
talked
at
meals
;
and
,
from
the
constant
habit
of
speaking
fast
and
loud
at
such
times
,
did
not
now
subdue
their
voices
much
.
  
<EOS>
M.
Paul
came
and
stood
behind
me
.
<EOS>
He
asked
at
what
I
was
working
;
and
I
said
I
was
making
a
watchguard
.
  
<EOS>
He
asked
,
"
For
whom
?
"
<EOS>
And
I
answered
,
"
For
a
gentleman
 
one
of
my
friends
.
"
  
<EOS>
M.
Paul
stooped
down
and
proceeded
 
as
novel
-
writers
say
,
and
,
as
was
literally
true
in
his
case
 
to
"
hiss
"
into
my
ear
some
poignant
words
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
that
,
of
all
the
women
he
knew
,
I
was
the
one
who
could
make
herself
the
most
consummately
unpleasant
:
<EOS>
I
was
she
with
whom
it
was
least
possible
to
live
on
friendly
terms
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
"
caractère
intraitable
,
"
and
perverse
to
a
miracle
.
<EOS>
How
I
managed
it
,
or
what
possessed
me
,
he
,
for
his
part
,
did
not
know
;
but
with
whatever
pacific
and
amicable
intentions
a
person
accosted
me
 
crac
!
<EOS>
I
turned
concord
to
discord
,
good
-
will
to
enmity
.
<EOS>
He
was
sure
,
he
 
M.
Paul
 
wished
me
well
enough
;
he
had
never
done
me
any
harm
that
he
knew
of
<EOS>
;
he
might
,
at
least
,
he
supposed
,
claim
a
right
to
be
regarded
as
a
neutral
acquaintance
,
guiltless
of
hostile
sentiments
:
<EOS>
yet
,
how
I
behaved
to
him
!
<EOS>
With
what
pungent
vivacities
 
<EOS>
what
an
impetus
of
mutiny
 
<EOS>
what
a
"
fougue
"
of
injustice
!
  
<EOS>
Here
I
could
not
avoid
opening
my
eyes
somewhat
wide
,
and
even
slipping
in
a
slight
interjectional
observation
:
"
Vivacities
?
<EOS>
Impetus
?
<EOS>
Fougue
?
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
....
<EOS>
"
  
"
Chut
!
à
l'instant
!
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
there
I
went
 
<EOS>
vive
comme
la
poudre
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
was
sorry
 
<EOS>
he
was
very
sorry
:
for
my
sake
he
grieved
over
the
hapless
peculiarity
.
<EOS>
This
"
emportement
,
"
this
"
chaleur
"
 
<EOS>
generous
,
perhaps
,
but
excessive
 
would
yet
,
he
feared
,
do
me
a
mischief
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
pity
:
I
was
not
 
he
believed
,
in
his
soul
 
wholly
without
good
qualities
:
and
would
I
but
hear
reason
,
and
be
more
sedate
,
more
sober
,
less
"
en
l'air
,
"
less
"
coquette
,
"
less
taken
by
show
,
less
prone
to
set
an
undue
value
on
outside
excellence
 
to
make
much
of
the
attentions
of
people
remarkable
chiefly
for
so
many
feet
of
stature
,
"
des
couleurs
de
poupée
,
"
"
un
nez
plus
ou
moins
bien
fait
,
"
and
an
enormous
amount
of
fatuity
 
I
might
yet
prove
an
useful
,
perhaps
an
exemplary
character
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
it
was
 
<EOS>
And
here
,
the
little
man
's
voice
was
for
a
minute
choked
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
looked
up
at
him
,
or
held
out
my
hand
,
or
said
a
soothing
word
;
but
I
was
afraid
,
if
I
stirred
,
I
should
either
laugh
or
cry
;
so
odd
,
in
all
this
,
was
the
mixture
of
the
touching
and
the
absurd
.
  
<EOS>
I
thought
he
had
nearly
done
:
<EOS>
but
no
<EOS>
;
he
sat
down
that
he
might
go
on
at
his
ease
.
  
<EOS>
"
While
he
,
M.
Paul
,
was
on
these
painful
topics
,
he
would
dare
my
anger
for
the
sake
of
my
good
,
and
would
venture
to
refer
to
a
change
he
had
noticed
in
my
dress
.
<EOS>
He
was
free
to
confess
that
when
he
first
knew
me
 
or
,
rather
,
was
in
the
habit
of
catching
a
passing
glimpse
of
me
from
time
to
time
 
I
satisfied
him
on
this
point
:
the
gravity
,
the
austere
simplicity
,
obvious
in
this
particular
,
were
such
as
to
inspire
the
highest
hopes
for
my
best
interests
.
<EOS>
What
fatal
influence
had
impelled
me
lately
to
introduce
flowers
under
the
brim
of
my
bonnet
,
to
wear
'
des
cols
brodés
,
"
and
even
to
appear
on
one
occasion
in
a
_
scarlet
gown
_
 
<EOS>
he
might
indeed
conjecture
,
but
,
for
the
present
,
would
not
openly
declare
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
I
interrupted
,
and
this
time
not
without
an
accent
at
once
indignant
and
horror
-
struck
.
  
<EOS>
"
Scarlet
,
Monsieur
Paul
?
<EOS>
It
was
not
scarlet
!
<EOS>
It
was
pink
,
and
pale
pink
to
:
and
further
subdued
by
black
lace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pink
or
scarlet
,
yellow
or
crimson
,
pea
-
green
or
sky
-
blue
,
it
was
all
one
:
these
were
all
flaunting
,
giddy
colours
;
and
as
to
the
lace
I
talked
of
,
_
that
_
was
but
a
"
colifichet
de
plus
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
he
sighed
over
my
degeneracy
.
"
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
he
was
sorry
to
say
,
be
so
particular
on
this
theme
as
he
could
wish
:
not
possessing
the
exact
names
of
these
"
babioles
,
"
he
might
run
into
small
verbal
errors
which
would
not
fail
to
lay
him
open
to
my
sarcasm
,
and
excite
my
unhappily
sudden
and
passionate
disposition
.
<EOS>
He
would
merely
say
,
in
general
terms
 
and
in
these
general
terms
he
knew
he
was
correct
 
<EOS>
that
my
costume
had
of
late
assumed
'
des
façons
mondaines
,
"
which
it
wounded
him
to
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
"
façons
mondaines
"
he
discovered
in
my
present
winter
merino
and
plain
white
collar
,
I
own
it
puzzled
me
to
guess
:
and
when
I
asked
him
,
he
said
it
was
all
made
with
too
much
attention
to
effect
 
and
besides
,
"
had
I
not
a
bow
of
ribbon
at
my
neck
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
you
condemn
a
bow
of
ribbon
for
a
lady
,
Monsieur
,
you
would
necessarily
disapprove
of
a
thing
like
this
for
a
gentleman
?
"
 
<EOS>
holding
up
my
bright
little
chainlet
of
silk
and
gold
.
<EOS>
His
sole
reply
was
a
groan
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
over
my
levity
.
  
<EOS>
After
sitting
some
minutes
in
silence
,
and
watching
the
progress
of
the
chain
,
at
which
I
now
wrought
more
assiduously
than
ever
,
he
inquired
:
"
Whether
what
he
had
just
said
would
have
the
effect
of
making
me
entirely
detest
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
remember
what
answer
I
made
,
or
how
it
came
about
;
I
do
n't
think
I
spoke
at
all
,
but
<EOS>
I
know
we
managed
to
bid
good
-
night
on
friendly
terms
:
and
,
even
after
M.
Paul
had
reached
the
door
,
he
turned
back
just
to
explain
,
"
that
he
would
not
be
understood
to
speak
in
entire
condemnation
of
the
scarlet
dress
"
(
"
Pink
!
<EOS>
pink
!
<EOS>
"
I
threw
in
)
;
"
that
he
had
no
intention
to
deny
it
the
merit
of
_
looking
_
<EOS>
rather
well
"
(
the
fact
was
,
M.
Emanuel
's
taste
in
colours
decidedly
leaned
to
the
brilliant
)
;
"
only
he
wished
to
counsel
me
,
whenever
,
I
wore
it
,
to
do
so
in
the
same
spirit
as
if
its
material
were
"
bure
,
"
and
its
hue
"
gris
de
poussière
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
the
flowers
under
my
bonnet
,
Monsieur
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
very
little
ones
 
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
them
little
,
then
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Permit
them
not
to
become
full
-
blown
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
the
bow
,
<EOS>
Monsieur
 
the
bit
of
ribbon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Va
pour
le
ruban
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
propitious
answer
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
we
settled
it
.
     
<EOS>
"
Well
done
,
Lucy
Snowe
!
<EOS>
"
cried
I
to
myself
;
"
you
have
come
in
for
a
pretty
lecture
 
brought
on
yourself
a
"
rude
savant
,
"
and
all
through
your
wicked
fondness
for
worldly
vanities
!
<EOS>
Who
would
have
thought
it
?
<EOS>
You
deemed
yourself
a
melancholy
sober
-
sides
enough
!
<EOS>
Miss
Fanshawe
there
regards
you
as
a
second
Diogenes
.
<EOS>
M.
de
Bassompierre
,
the
other
day
,
politely
turned
the
conversation
when
it
ran
on
the
wild
gifts
of
the
actress
Vashti
,
because
,
as
he
kindly
said
,
"
Miss
Snowe
looked
uncomfortable
.
"
<EOS>
Dr.
John
Bretton
knows
you
only
as
"
quiet
Lucy
"
 
"
<EOS>
a
creature
inoffensive
as
a
shadow
;
"
he
has
said
,
and
you
have
heard
him
say
it
:
"
Lucy
's
disadvantages
spring
from
over
-
gravity
in
tastes
and
manner
 
want
of
colour
in
character
and
costume
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
are
your
own
and
your
friends
'
impressions
;
and
behold
!
<EOS>
there
starts
up
a
little
man
,
differing
diametrically
from
all
these
,
roundly
charging
you
with
being
too
airy
and
cheery
 
<EOS>
too
volatile
and
versatile
 
too
flowery
and
coloury
.
<EOS>
This
harsh
little
man
 
<EOS>
this
pitiless
censor
 
<EOS>
gathers
up
all
your
poor
scattered
sins
of
vanity
,
your
luckless
chiffon
of
rose
-
colour
,
your
small
fringe
of
a
wreath
,
your
small
scrap
of
ribbon
,
your
silly
bit
of
lace
,
and
calls
you
to
account
for
the
lot
,
and
for
each
item
.
<EOS>
You
are
well
habituated
to
be
passed
by
as
a
shadow
in
Life
's
sunshine
:
it
its
a
new
thing
to
see
one
testily
lifting
his
hand
to
screen
his
eyes
,
because
you
tease
him
with
an
obtrusive
ray

<EOS>
MONSIEUR
'S
FÊTE
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
up
the
next
morning
an
hour
before
daybreak
,
and
finished
my
guard
,
kneeling
on
the
dormitory
floor
beside
the
centre
stand
,
for
the
benefit
of
such
expiring
glimmer
as
the
night
-
lamp
afforded
in
its
last
watch
.
  
<EOS>
All
my
materials
 
my
whole
stock
of
beads
and
silk
 
were
used
up
before
the
chain
assumed
the
length
and
richness
<EOS>
I
wished
;
I
had
wrought
it
double
,
as
I
knew
,
by
the
rule
of
contraries
,
that
to
,
suit
the
particular
taste
whose
gratification
was
in
view
,
an
effective
appearance
was
quite
indispensable
.
<EOS>
As
a
finish
to
the
ornament
,
a
little
gold
clasp
was
needed
;
fortunately
I
possessed
it
in
the
fastening
of
my
sole
necklace
;
I
duly
detached
and
re
-
attached
it
,
then
coiled
compactly
the
completed
guard
;
and
enclosed
it
in
a
small
box
I
had
bought
for
its
brilliancy
,
made
of
some
tropic
shell
of
the
colour
called
"
nacarat
,
"
and
decked
with
a
little
coronal
of
sparkling
blue
stones
.
<EOS>
Within
the
lid
of
the
box
,
I
carefully
graved
with
my
scissors
'
point
certain
initials
.
     
<EOS>
The
reader
will
,
perhaps
,
remember
the
description
of
Madame
Beck
's
fête
;
nor
will
he
have
forgotten
that
at
each
anniversary
,
a
handsome
present
was
subscribed
for
and
offered
by
the
school
.
<EOS>
The
observance
of
this
day
was
a
distinction
accorded
to
none
but
Madame
,
and
,
in
a
modified
form
,
to
her
kinsman
and
counsellor
,
M.
Emanuel
.
<EOS>
In
the
latter
case
it
was
an
honour
spontaneously
awarded
,
not
plotted
and
contrived
beforehand
,
and
offered
an
additional
proof
,
amongst
many
others
,
of
the
estimation
in
which
 
despite
his
partialities
,
prejudices
,
and
irritabilities
 
<EOS>
the
professor
of
literature
was
held
by
his
pupils
.
<EOS>
No
article
of
value
was
offered
to
him
:
he
distinctly
gave
it
to
be
understood
,
that
he
would
accept
neither
plate
nor
jewellery
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
liked
a
slight
tribute
;
the
cost
,
the
money
-
value
,
did
not
touch
him
:
a
diamond
ring
,
a
gold
snuff
-
box
,
presented
,
with
pomp
,
would
have
pleased
him
less
than
a
flower
,
or
a
drawing
,
offered
simply
and
with
sincere
feelings
.
<EOS>
Such
was
his
nature
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
,
not
wise
in
his
generation
,
yet
could
he
claim
a
filial
sympathy
with
"
the
dayspring
on
high
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
M.
Paul
's
fête
fell
on
the
first
of
March
and
a
Thursday
.
<EOS>
It
proved
a
fine
sunny
day
;
and
being
likewise
the
morning
on
which
it
was
customary
to
attend
mass
;
being
also
otherwise
distinguished
by
the
half
-
holiday
which
permitted
the
privilege
of
walking
out
,
shopping
,
or
paying
visits
in
the
afternoon
:
these
combined
considerations
induced
a
general
smartness
and
freshness
of
dress
.
<EOS>
Clean
collars
were
in
vogue
;
the
ordinary
dingy
woollen
classe
-
dress
was
exchanged
for
something
lighter
and
clearer
.
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Zélie
St.
Pierre
,
on
this
particular
Thursday
,
even
assumed
a
"
robe
de
soie
,
"
deemed
in
economical
Labassecour
an
article
of
hazardous
splendour
and
luxury
;
nay
,
it
was
remarked
that
she
sent
for
a
"
coiffeur
"
to
dress
her
hair
that
morning
;
there
were
pupils
acute
enough
to
discover
that
she
had
bedewed
her
handkerchief
and
her
hands
with
a
new
and
fashionable
perfume
.
<EOS>
Poor
Zélie
!
<EOS>
It
was
much
her
wo
nt
to
declare
about
this
time
,
that
she
was
tired
to
death
of
a
life
of
seclusion
and
labour
;
that
she
longed
to
have
the
means
and
leisure
for
relaxation
;
to
have
some
one
to
work
for
her
 
a
husband
who
would
pay
her
debts
(
she
was
woefully
encumbered
with
debt
)
,
supply
her
wardrobe
,
and
leave
her
at
liberty
,
as
she
said
,
to
"
goûter
un
peu
les
plaisirs
.
<EOS>
"
It
had
long
been
rumoured
,
that
her
eye
was
upon
M.
Emanuel
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
Emanuel
's
eye
was
certainly
often
upon
her
.
<EOS>
He
would
sit
and
watch
her
perseveringly
for
minutes
together
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
give
her
a
quarter
-
of
-
an
-
hour
's
gaze
,
while
the
class
was
silently
composing
,
and
he
sat
throned
on
his
estrade
,
unoccupied
.
<EOS>
Conscious
always
of
this
basilisk
attention
,
she
would
writhe
under
it
,
half
-
flattered
,
half
-
puzzled
,
and
Monsieur
would
follow
her
sensations
,
sometimes
looking
appallingly
acute
;
for
in
some
cases
,
he
had
the
terrible
unerring
penetration
of
instinct
,
and
pierced
in
its
hiding
-
place
the
last
lurking
thought
of
the
heart
,
and
discerned
under
florid
veilings
the
bare
;
<EOS>
barren
places
of
the
spirit
:
<EOS>
yes
,
and
its
perverted
tendencies
,
and
its
hidden
false
curves
 
all
that
men
and
women
would
not
have
known
 
the
twisted
spine
,
the
malformed
limb
that
was
born
with
them
,
and
far
worse
,
the
stain
or
disfigurement
they
have
perhaps
brought
on
themselves
.
<EOS>
No
calamity
so
accursed
but
M.
Emanuel
could
pity
and
forgive
,
if
it
were
acknowledged
candidly
;
but
where
his
questioning
eyes
met
dishonest
denial
 
where
his
ruthless
researches
found
deceitful
concealment
 
<EOS>
oh
,
then
,
he
could
be
cruel
,
and
I
thought
wicked
!
<EOS>
he
would
exultantly
snatch
the
screen
from
poor
shrinking
wretches
,
passionately
hurry
them
to
the
summit
of
the
mount
of
exposure
,
and
there
show
them
all
naked
,
all
false
 
poor
living
lies
 
the
spawn
of
that
horrid
Truth
which
can
not
be
looked
on
unveiled
.
<EOS>
He
thought
he
did
justice
;
for
my
part
I
doubt
whether
man
has
a
right
to
do
such
justice
on
man
:
more
than
once
in
these
his
visitations
,
I
have
felt
compelled
to
give
tears
to
his
victims
,
and
not
spared
ire
and
keen
reproach
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
deserved
it
;
but
it
was
difficult
to
shake
him
in
his
firm
conviction
that
the
work
was
righteous
and
needed
.
  
<EOS>
Breakfast
being
over
and
mass
attended
,
the
school
-
bell
rang
and
the
rooms
filled
:
a
very
pretty
spectacle
was
presented
in
classe
.
<EOS>
Pupils
and
teachers
sat
neatly
arrayed
,
orderly
and
expectant
,
each
bearing
in
her
hand
the
bouquet
of
felicitation
 
the
prettiest
spring
-
flowers
all
fresh
,
and
filling
the
air
with
their
fragrance
:
I
only
had
no
bouquet
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
see
flowers
growing
,
but
when
they
are
gathered
,
they
cease
to
please
.
<EOS>
I
look
on
them
as
things
rootless
and
perishable
;
their
likeness
to
life
makes
me
sad
.
<EOS>
I
never
offer
flowers
to
those
I
love
;
I
never
wish
to
receive
them
from
hands
dear
to
me
.
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
St.
Pierre
marked
my
empty
hands
 
<EOS>
she
could
not
believe
I
had
been
so
remiss
;
with
avidity
her
eye
roved
over
and
round
me
:
surely
I
must
have
some
solitary
symbolic
flower
somewhere
:
some
small
knot
of
violets
,
something
to
win
myself
praise
for
taste
,
commendation
for
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
The
unimaginative
"
Anglaise
"
proved
better
than
the
Parisienne
's
fears
:
she
sat
literally
unprovided
,
as
bare
of
bloom
or
leaf
as
the
winter
tree
.
<EOS>
This
ascertained
,
Zélie
smiled
,
well
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
wisely
you
have
acted
to
keep
your
money
,
Miss
Lucie
,
"
she
said
:
"
silly
I
have
gone
and
thrown
away
two
francs
on
a
bouquet
of
hot
-
house
flowers
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
she
showed
with
pride
her
splendid
nosegay
.
  
<EOS>
But
hush
!
<EOS>
a
step
:
<EOS>
_
the
_
step
.
<EOS>
It
came
prompt
,
as
usual
,
but
with
a
promptitude
,
we
felt
disposed
to
flatter
ourselves
,
inspired
by
other
feelings
than
mere
excitability
of
nerve
and
vehemence
of
intent
.
<EOS>
We
thought
our
Professor
's
"
foot
-
fall
"
(
to
speak
romantically
)
had
in
it
a
friendly
promise
this
morning
;
and
so
it
had
.
  
<EOS>
He
entered
in
a
mood
which
made
him
as
good
as
a
new
sunbeam
to
the
already
well
-
lit
first
classe
.
<EOS>
The
morning
light
playing
amongst
our
plants
and
laughing
on
our
walls
,
caught
an
added
lustre
from
M.
Paul
's
all
-
benignant
salute
.
<EOS>
Like
a
true
Frenchman
(
though
I
do
n't
know
why
I
should
say
so
,
for
he
was
of
strain
<EOS>
neither
French
nor
Labassecourien
)
,
he
had
dressed
for
the
"
situation
"
and
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Not
by
the
vague
folds
,
sinister
and
conspirator
-
like
,
of
his
soot
-
dark
paletôt
were
the
outlines
of
his
person
obscured
;
on
the
contrary
,
his
figure
(
such
as
it
was
,
I
do
n't
boast
of
it
)
was
well
set
off
by
a
civilized
coat
and
a
silken
vest
quite
pretty
to
behold
.
<EOS>
The
defiant
and
pagan
bonnet
-
grec
had
vanished
:
bare
-
headed
,
he
came
upon
us
,
carrying
a
Christian
hat
in
his
gloved
hand
.
<EOS>
The
little
man
looked
well
,
very
well
;
there
was
a
clearness
of
amity
in
his
blue
eye
,
and
a
glow
of
good
feeling
on
his
dark
complexion
,
which
passed
perfectly
in
the
place
of
beauty
:
one
really
did
not
care
to
observe
that
his
nose
,
though
far
from
small
,
was
of
no
particular
shape
,
<EOS>
his
cheek
thin
,
his
brow
marked
and
square
,
his
mouth
<EOS>
no
rose
-
bud
:
<EOS>
one
accepted
him
as
he
was
,
and
felt
his
presence
the
reverse
of
damping
or
insignificant
.
  
<EOS>
He
passed
to
his
desk
;
he
placed
on
the
same
his
hat
and
gloves
.
"
<EOS>
Bon
jour
,
mes
amies
,
"
said
he
,
in
a
tone
that
somehow
made
amends
to
some
amongst
us
for
many
a
sharp
snap
and
savage
snarl
:
not
a
jocund
,
good
-
fellow
tone
,
still
less
an
unctuous
priestly
,
accent
,
but
a
voice
he
had
belonging
to
himself
 
a
voice
used
when
his
heart
passed
the
words
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
That
same
heart
did
speak
sometimes
;
though
an
irritable
,
it
was
not
an
ossified
organ
:
in
its
core
was
a
place
,
tender
beyond
a
man
's
tenderness
;
a
place
that
humbled
him
to
little
children
,
that
bound
him
to
girls
and
women
to
whom
,
rebel
as
he
would
,
he
could
not
disown
his
affinity
,
nor
quite
deny
that
,
on
the
whole
,
he
was
better
with
them
than
with
his
own
sex
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
all
wish
Monsieur
a
good
day
,
and
present
to
him
our
congratulations
on
the
anniversary
of
his
fête
,
"
said
Mademoiselle
Zélie
,
constituting
herself
spokeswoman
of
the
assembly
;
and
advancing
with
no
more
twists
of
affectation
than
were
with
her
indispensable
to
the
achievement
of
motion
,
she
laid
her
costly
bouquet
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
bowed
over
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
long
train
of
offerings
followed
:
all
the
pupils
,
sweeping
past
with
the
gliding
step
foreigners
practise
,
left
their
tributes
as
they
went
by
.
<EOS>
Each
girl
so
dexterously
adjusted
her
separate
gift
,
that
when
the
last
bouquet
was
laid
on
the
desk
,
it
formed
the
apex
to
a
blooming
pyramid
 
a
pyramid
blooming
,
spreading
,
and
towering
with
such
exuberance
as
,
in
the
end
,
to
eclipse
the
hero
behind
it
.
<EOS>
This
ceremony
over
,
seats
were
resumed
,
and
we
sat
in
dead
silence
,
expectant
of
a
speech
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
five
minutes
might
have
elapsed
,
and
the
hush
remained
unbroken
;
ten
 
<EOS>
and
there
was
no
sound
.
  
<EOS>
Many
present
began
,
doubtless
,
to
wonder
for
what
Monsieur
waited
;
as
well
they
might
.
<EOS>
Voiceless
and
viewless
,
stirless
and
wordless
,
he
kept
his
station
behind
the
pile
of
flowers
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
there
issued
forth
a
voice
,
rather
deep
,
as
if
it
spoke
out
of
a
hollow
:
    
"
Est
-
ce
là
tout
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Zélie
looked
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
all
presented
your
bouquets
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
she
of
the
pupils
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
;
they
had
all
given
their
nosegays
,
from
the
eldest
to
the
youngest
,
from
the
tallest
to
the
most
diminutive
.
<EOS>
The
senior
mistress
signified
as
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
Est
-
ce
là
tout
?
"
was
reiterated
in
an
intonation
which
,
deep
before
,
had
now
descended
some
notes
lower
.
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
"
said
Mademoiselle
St.
Pierre
,
rising
,
and
<EOS>
this
time
speaking
with
her
own
sweet
smile
,
"
I
have
the
honour
to
tell
you
that
,
with
a
single
exception
,
every
person
in
classe
has
offered
her
bouquet
.
<EOS>
For
Meess
Lucie
,
Monsieur
will
kindly
make
allowance
;
as
a
foreigner
she
probably
did
not
know
our
customs
,
or
did
not
appreciate
their
significance
.
<EOS>
Meess
Lucie
has
regarded
this
ceremony
as
too
frivolous
to
be
honoured
by
her
observance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Famous
!
<EOS>
"
I
muttered
between
my
teeth
:
"
you
are
no
bad
speaker
,
Zélie
,
when
you
begin
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
answer
vouchsafed
to
Mademoiselle
St
Pierre
from
the
estrade
was
given
in
the
gesticulation
of
a
hand
from
behind
the
pyramid
.
<EOS>
This
manual
action
seemed
to
deprecate
words
,
to
enjoin
silence
.
  
<EOS>
A
form
,
ere
long
,
followed
the
hand
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
emerged
from
his
eclipse
;
and
producing
himself
on
the
front
of
his
estrade
,
and
gazing
straight
and
fixedly
before
him
at
a
vast
"
mappe
-
monde
"
covering
the
wall
opposite
,
he
demanded
a
third
time
,
and
now
in
really
tragic
tones
    
"
Est
-
ce
là
tout
?
<EOS>
"
  
I
might
yet
have
made
all
right
,
by
stepping
forwards
and
slipping
into
his
hand
the
ruddy
little
shell
-
box
I
at
that
moment
held
tight
in
my
own
.
<EOS>
It
was
what
I
had
fully
purposed
to
do
;
but
,
first
,
the
comic
side
of
Monsieur
's
behaviour
had
tempted
me
to
delay
,
and
now
,
Mademoiselle
St.
Pierre
's
affected
interference
provoked
contumacity
.
<EOS>
The
reader
not
having
hitherto
had
any
cause
to
ascribe
to
Miss
Snowe
's
character
the
most
distant
pretensions
to
perfection
,
will
be
scarcely
surprised
to
learn
that
she
felt
too
perverse
to
defend
herself
from
any
imputation
the
Parisienne
might
choose
to
insinuate
and
besides
,
M.
Paul
was
so
tragic
,
and
took
my
defection
so
seriously
<EOS>
,
he
deserved
to
be
vexed
.
<EOS>
I
kept
,
then
,
both
my
box
and
my
countenance
,
and
sat
insensate
as
any
stone
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
well
!
<EOS>
"
dropped
at
length
from
the
lips
of
M.
Paul
;
and
having
uttered
this
phrase
,
the
shadow
of
some
great
paroxysm
 
the
swell
of
wrath
,
scorn
,
resolve
 
passed
over
his
brow
,
rippled
his
lips
,
and
lined
his
cheeks
.
<EOS>
Gulping
down
all
further
comment
,
he
launched
into
his
customary
"
discours
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
at
all
remember
what
this
"
discours
"
was
;
I
did
not
listen
to
it
:
the
gulping
-
down
process
,
the
abrupt
dismissal
of
his
mortification
or
vexation
,
had
given
me
a
sensation
which
half
-
counteracted
the
ludicrous
effect
of
the
reiterated
"
Est
-
ce
là
tout
?
"
  
<EOS>
Towards
the
close
of
the
speech
there
came
a
pleasing
diversion
my
attention
was
again
amusingly
arrested
.
  
<EOS>
Owing
to
some
little
accidental
movement
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
dropped
my
thimble
on
the
floor
,
and
in
stooping
to
regain
it
,
hit
the
crown
of
my
head
against
the
sharp
corner
of
my
desk
;
<EOS>
which
casualties
(
exasperating
to
me
,
by
rights
,
if
to
anybody
)
naturally
made
a
slight
bustle
 
<EOS>
M.
Paul
became
irritated
,
and
dismissing
his
forced
equanimity
,
and
casting
to
the
winds
that
dignity
and
self
-
control
with
which
he
never
cared
long
to
encumber
himself
,
he
broke
forth
into
the
strain
best
calculated
to
give
him
ease
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
,
in
the
progress
of
his
"
discours
,
"
he
had
contrived
to
cross
the
Channel
and
land
on
British
ground
;
but
there
I
found
him
when
I
began
to
listen
.
  
<EOS>
Casting
a
quick
,
cynical
glance
round
the
room
 
a
glance
which
scathed
,
or
was
intended
to
scathe
,
as
it
crossed
me
 
<EOS>
he
fell
with
fury
upon
"
les
Anglaises
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Never
have
I
heard
English
women
handled
as
M.
Paul
that
morning
handled
them
:
he
spared
nothing
 
neither
their
minds
,
morals
,
manners
,
nor
personal
appearance
.
<EOS>
I
specially
remember
his
abuse
of
their
tall
stature
,
their
long
necks
,
their
thin
arms
,
their
slovenly
dress
,
their
pedantic
education
,
their
impious
scepticism
(
!
)
,
their
insufferable
pride
,
their
pretentious
virtue
:
over
which
he
ground
his
teeth
malignantly
,
and
looked
as
if
,
had
he
dared
,
he
would
have
said
singular
things
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
he
was
spiteful
,
acrid
,
savage
;
and
,
as
a
natural
consequence
,
detestably
ugly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Little
wicked
venomous
man
!
"
<EOS>
thought
I
;
"
am
I
going
to
harass
myself
with
fears
of
displeasing
you
,
or
hurting
your
feelings
?
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
;
you
shall
be
indifferent
to
me
,
as
the
shabbiest
bouquet
in
your
pyramid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
grieve
to
say
I
could
not
quite
carry
out
this
resolution
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
the
abuse
of
England
and
the
English
found
and
left
me
stolid
:
I
bore
it
some
fifteen
minutes
stoically
enough
;
but
this
hissing
cockatrice
was
determined
to
sting
,
and
he
said
such
things
at
last
 
fastening
not
only
upon
our
women
,
but
upon
our
greatest
names
and
best
men
;
sullying
,
the
shield
of
Britannia
,
and
dabbling
the
union
jack
in
mud
 
that
I
was
stung
.
<EOS>
With
vicious
relish
he
brought
up
the
most
spicy
current
continental
historical
falsehoods
 
than
which
nothing
can
be
conceived
more
offensive
.
<EOS>
Zélie
,
and
the
whole
class
,
became
one
grin
of
vindictive
delight
;
for
it
is
curious
to
discover
how
these
clowns
of
Labassecour
secretly
hate
England
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
I
struck
a
sharp
stroke
on
my
desk
,
opened
my
lips
,
and
let
loose
this
cry
:
    
<EOS>
"
Vive
l'Angleterre
,
l'Histoire
et
les
Héros
!
<EOS>
A
bas
<EOS>
la
France
,
la
Fiction
et
les
Faquins
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
class
was
struck
of
a
heap
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
thought
me
mad
.
<EOS>
The
Professor
put
up
his
handkerchief
,
and
fiendishly
smiled
into
its
folds
.
<EOS>
Little
monster
of
malice
!
<EOS>
He
now
thought
he
had
got
the
victory
,
since
he
had
made
me
angry
.
<EOS>
In
a
second
he
became
good
-
humoured
.
<EOS>
With
great
blandness
he
resumed
the
subject
of
his
flowers
;
talked
poetically
and
symbolically
of
their
sweetness
,
perfume
,
purity
,
etcetera
;
made
Frenchified
comparisons
between
the
"
jeunes
filles
"
and
the
sweet
blossoms
before
him
;
paid
Mademoiselle
St.
Pierre
a
very
full
-
blown
compliment
on
the
superiority
of
her
bouquet
;
and
ended
by
announcing
that
the
first
really
fine
,
mild
,
and
balmy
morning
in
spring
,
he
intended
to
take
the
whole
class
out
to
breakfast
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
Such
of
the
class
,
at
least
,
"
he
added
,
with
emphasis
,
"
as
he
could
count
amongst
the
number
of
his
friends
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Donc
je
n'y
serai
pas
,
"
declared
I
,
involuntarily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Soit
!
<EOS>
"
was
his
response
;
and
,
gathering
his
flowers
in
his
arms
,
he
flashed
out
of
classe
;
while
I
,
consigning
my
work
,
scissors
,
thimble
,
and
the
neglected
little
box
,
to
my
desk
,
swept
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
_
<EOS>
he
_
felt
hot
and
angry
,
but
I
am
free
to
confess
that
_
I
_
did
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
with
a
strange
evanescent
anger
,
I
had
not
sat
an
hour
on
the
edge
of
my
bed
,
picturing
and
repicturing
his
look
,
manner
,
words
ere
I
smiled
at
the
whole
scene
.
<EOS>
A
little
pang
of
regret
<EOS>
I
underwent
that
the
box
had
not
been
offered
.
<EOS>
I
had
meant
to
gratify
him
.
<EOS>
Fate
would
not
have
it
so
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
afternoon
,
remembering
that
desks
in
classe
were
by
no
means
inviolate
repositories
,
and
thinking
that
it
was
as
well
to
secure
the
box
,
on
account
of
the
initials
in
the
lid
,
P.
C.
D.
E.
,
for
Paul
Carl
(
or
Carlos
)
<EOS>
David
Emanuel
 
<EOS>
such
was
his
full
name
 
<EOS>
these
foreigners
must
always
have
a
string
of
baptismals
 
I
descended
to
the
schoolroom
.
  
<EOS>
It
slept
in
holiday
repose
.
<EOS>
The
day
pupils
were
all
gone
home
,
the
boarders
were
out
walking
,
the
teachers
,
except
the
surveillante
of
the
week
,
were
in
town
,
visiting
or
shopping
;
the
suite
of
divisions
was
vacant
;
so
was
the
grande
salle
,
with
its
huge
solemn
globe
hanging
in
the
midst
,
its
pair
of
many
-
branched
chandeliers
,
and
its
horizontal
grand
piano
closed
,
silent
,
enjoying
its
mid
-
week
Sabbath
.
<EOS>
I
rather
wondered
to
find
the
first
classe
door
ajar
;
this
room
being
usually
locked
when
empty
,
and
being
then
inaccessible
to
any
save
Madame
Beck
and
myself
,
who
possessed
a
duplicate
key
.
<EOS>
I
wondered
still
more
,
on
approaching
,
to
hear
a
vague
movement
as
of
life
 
a
step
,
a
chair
stirred
,
a
sound
like
the
opening
of
a
desk
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
only
Madame
Beck
doing
inspection
duty
,
"
was
the
conclusion
following
a
moment
's
reflection
.
<EOS>
The
partially
-
opened
door
gave
opportunity
for
assurance
on
this
point
.
<EOS>
I
looked
.
<EOS>
Behold
!
<EOS>
not
the
inspecting
garb
of
Madame
Beck
 
<EOS>
the
shawl
and
the
clean
cap
 
but
the
coat
,
and
the
close
-
shorn
,
dark
head
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
This
person
occupied
my
chair
;
his
olive
hand
held
my
desk
open
,
his
nose
was
lost
to
view
amongst
my
papers
.
<EOS>
His
back
was
towards
me
,
but
there
could
not
be
a
moment
's
question
about
identity
.
<EOS>
Already
was
the
attire
of
ceremony
discarded
:
the
cherished
and
ink
-
stained
paletôt
was
resumed
;
the
perverse
bonnet
-
grec
lay
on
the
floor
,
as
if
just
dropped
from
the
hand
,
culpably
busy
.
  
<EOS>
Now
I
knew
,
and
I
had
long
known
,
that
that
hand
of
M.
Emanuel
's
was
on
the
most
intimate
terms
with
my
desk
;
that
it
raised
and
lowered
the
lid
,
ransacked
and
arranged
the
contents
,
almost
as
familiarly
as
my
own
.
<EOS>
The
fact
was
not
dubious
,
nor
did
he
wish
it
to
be
so
<EOS>
:
he
left
signs
of
each
visit
palpable
and
unmistakable
;
hitherto
,
however
,
I
had
never
caught
him
in
the
act
<EOS>
:
watch
as
I
would
,
I
could
not
detect
the
hours
and
moments
of
his
coming
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
brownie
's
work
in
exercises
left
overnight
full
of
faults
,
and
found
next
morning
carefully
corrected
:
I
profited
by
his
capricious
good
-
will
in
loans
full
welcome
and
refreshing
.
<EOS>
Between
a
sallow
dictionary
and
worn
-
out
grammar
would
magically
grow
a
fresh
interesting
new
work
,
or
a
classic
,
mellow
and
sweet
in
its
ripe
age
.
<EOS>
Out
of
my
work
-
basket
would
laughingly
peep
a
romance
,
under
it
would
lurk
the
pamphlet
,
the
magazine
,
whence
last
evening
's
reading
had
been
extracted
.
<EOS>
Impossible
to
doubt
the
source
whence
these
treasures
flowed
:
had
there
been
no
other
indication
,
one
condemning
and
traitor
peculiarity
,
common
to
them
all
,
settled
the
question
 
_
<EOS>
they
smelt
of
cigars
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
This
was
very
shocking
,
of
course
:
_
<EOS>
I
_
thought
so
at
first
,
and
used
to
open
the
window
with
some
bustle
,
to
air
my
desk
,
and
with
fastidious
finger
and
thumb
,
to
hold
the
peccant
brochures
forth
to
the
purifying
breeze
.
<EOS>
I
was
cured
of
that
formality
suddenly
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
caught
me
at
it
one
day
,
understood
the
inference
,
instantly
relieved
my
hand
of
its
burden
,
and
,
in
another
moment
,
would
have
thrust
the
same
into
the
glowing
stove
.
<EOS>
It
chanced
to
be
a
book
,
on
the
perusal
of
which
I
was
bent
;
so
<EOS>
for
once
I
proved
as
decided
and
quicker
than
himself
;
recaptured
the
spoil
,
and
 
having
saved
this
volume
 
never
hazarded
a
second
.
<EOS>
With
all
this
,
I
had
never
yet
been
able
to
arrest
in
his
visits
the
freakish
,
friendly
,
cigar
-
loving
phantom
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
at
last
I
had
him
:
there
he
was
 
the
very
brownie
himself
;
and
there
,
curling
from
his
lips
,
was
the
pale
blue
breath
of
his
Indian
darling
:
he
was
smoking
into
my
desk
:
it
might
well
betray
him
.
<EOS>
Provoked
at
this
particular
,
and
yet
pleased
to
surprise
him
 
pleased
,
that
is
,
with
the
mixed
feeling
of
the
housewife
who
discovers
at
last
her
strange
elfin
ally
busy
in
the
dairy
at
the
untimely
churn
 
I
softly
stole
forward
,
stood
behind
him
,
bent
with
precaution
over
his
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
My
heart
smote
me
to
see
that
 
after
this
morning
's
hostility
,
after
my
seeming
remissness
,
after
the
puncture
experienced
by
his
feelings
,
and
the
ruffling
undergone
by
his
temper
 
he
,
all
willing
to
forget
and
forgive
,
had
brought
me
a
couple
of
handsome
volumes
,
of
which
the
title
and
authorship
were
guarantees
for
interest
.
<EOS>
Now
,
as
he
sat
bending
above
the
desk
,
he
was
stirring
up
its
contents
;
but
with
gentle
and
careful
hand
;
disarranging
indeed
,
but
not
harming
.
<EOS>
My
heart
smote
me
:
<EOS>
as
I
bent
over
him
,
as
he
sat
unconscious
,
doing
me
what
good
he
could
,
and
I
daresay
not
feeling
towards
me
unkindly
,
my
morning
's
anger
quite
melted
:
I
did
not
dislike
Professor
Emanuel
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
he
heard
me
breathe
.
<EOS>
He
turned
suddenly
:
his
temperament
was
nervous
,
yet
he
never
started
,
and
seldom
changed
colour
:
there
was
something
hardy
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
were
gone
into
town
with
the
other
teachers
,
"
said
he
,
taking
a
grim
gripe
of
his
self
-
possession
,
which
half
-
escaped
him
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
as
well
you
are
not
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
care
for
being
caught
?
<EOS>
Not
I.
I
often
visit
your
desk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
find
a
brochure
or
tome
now
and
then
;
but
you
do
n't
read
them
,
because
they
have
passed
under
this
?
"
 
touching
his
cigar
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
,
and
are
no
better
for
the
process
;
but
I
read
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Without
pleasure
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
must
not
be
contradicted
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
like
them
,
or
any
of
them
?
 
<EOS>
are
they
acceptable
?
"
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
has
seen
me
reading
them
a
hundred
times
,
and
knows
I
have
not
so
many
recreations
as
to
undervalue
those
he
provides
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
well
;
and
,
if
you
see
that
I
mean
well
,
and
derive
some
little
amusement
from
my
efforts
,
why
can
we
not
be
friends
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
fatalist
would
say
 
because
we
can
not
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
This
morning
,
"
he
continued
,
"
I
awoke
in
a
bright
mood
,
and
came
into
classe
happy
;
you
spoiled
my
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Monsieur
,
only
an
hour
or
two
of
it
,
and
that
unintentionally
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Unintentionally
!
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
It
was
my
fête
-
day
;
everybody
wished
me
happiness
but
you
.
<EOS>
The
little
children
of
the
third
division
gave
each
her
knot
of
violets
,
lisped
each
her
congratulation
:
 
you
 
nothing
.
<EOS>
Not
a
bud
,
leaf
,
whisper
 
not
a
glance
.
<EOS>
Was
this
unintentional
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
meant
no
harm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
really
did
not
know
our
custom
?
<EOS>
You
were
unprepared
?
<EOS>
You
would
willingly
have
laid
out
a
few
centimes
on
a
flower
to
give
me
pleasure
,
had
you
been
aware
that
it
was
expected
?
<EOS>
Say
so
,
and
all
is
forgotten
,
and
the
pain
soothed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
know
that
it
was
expected
:
I
_
was
_
prepared
;
yet
I
laid
out
no
centimes
on
flowers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
well
 
you
do
right
to
be
honest
.
<EOS>
I
should
almost
have
hated
<EOS>
you
had
you
flattered
and
lied
.
<EOS>
Better
declare
at
once
"
<EOS>
Paul
Carl
Emanuel
 
<EOS>
je
te
déteste
,
mon
garçon
!
"
 
<EOS>
than
smile
an
interest
,
look
an
affection
,
and
be
false
and
cold
at
heart
.
<EOS>
False
and
cold
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
you
are
;
but
you
have
made
a
great
mistake
in
life
,
that
I
believe
<EOS>
;
I
think
your
judgment
is
warped
 
that
you
are
indifferent
where
you
ought
to
be
grateful
 
and
perhaps
devoted
and
infatuated
,
where
you
ought
to
be
cool
as
your
name
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
suppose
that
I
wish
you
to
have
a
passion
for
me
,
Mademoiselle
;
Dieu
vous
en
garde
!
<EOS>
What
do
you
start
for
?
<EOS>
Because
I
said
passion
?
<EOS>
Well
,
I
say
it
again
.
<EOS>
There
is
such
a
word
,
and
there
is
such
a
thing
 
though
not
within
these
walls
,
thank
heaven
!
<EOS>
You
are
no
child
that
one
should
not
speak
of
what
exists
;
but
I
only
uttered
the
word
 
the
thing
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
is
alien
to
my
whole
life
and
views
.
<EOS>
It
died
in
the
past
 
in
the
present
<EOS>
it
lies
buried
 
<EOS>
its
grave
is
deep
-
dug
,
well
-
heaped
,
and
many
winters
old
:
in
the
future
there
will
be
a
resurrection
,
as
I
believe
to
my
souls
consolation
;
but
all
will
then
be
changed
 
form
and
feeling
:
the
mortal
will
have
put
on
immortality
 
it
will
rise
,
not
for
earth
,
but
heaven
.
<EOS>
All
I
say
to
_
you
_
,
Miss
Lucy
Snowe
,
is
 
that
you
ought
to
treat
Professor
Paul
Emanuel
decently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
,
and
did
not
contradict
such
a
sentiment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
when
it
is
_
<EOS>
your
_
fête
-
day
,
and
<EOS>
I
will
not
grudge
a
few
centimes
for
a
small
offering
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
like
me
,
Monsieur
:
<EOS>
this
cost
more
than
a
few
centimes
,
and
I
did
not
grudge
its
price
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
taking
from
the
open
desk
the
little
box
,
I
put
it
into
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
lay
ready
in
my
lap
this
morning
,
"
I
continued
;
"
and
if
Monsieur
had
been
rather
more
patient
,
and
Mademoiselle
St.
Pierre
less
interfering
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
should
say
,
too
,
if
_
I
_
had
been
calmer
and
wiser
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
given
it
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
the
box
:
I
saw
its
clear
warm
tint
and
bright
azure
circlet
,
pleased
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
to
open
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
initials
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
indicating
the
letters
in
the
lid
.
<EOS>
"
Who
told
you
I
was
called
Carl
David
?
"
  
"
A
little
bird
,
Monsieur
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
it
fly
from
me
to
you
?
<EOS>
Then
one
can
tie
a
message
under
its
wing
when
needful
.
"
,
  
<EOS>
He
took
out
the
chain
 
a
trifle
indeed
as
to
value
,
but
glossy
with
silk
and
sparkling
with
beads
.
<EOS>
He
liked
that
too
 
admired
it
artlessly
,
like
a
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
thing
you
were
working
at
last
night
?
"
  
"
The
same
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
finished
it
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
commenced
it
with
the
intention
that
it
should
be
mine
?
"
  
"
Undoubtedly
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
offered
on
my
fête
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
purpose
continued
as
you
wove
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Again
I
assented
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
is
not
necessary
that
I
should
cut
out
any
portion
 
<EOS>
saying
,
this
part
is
not
mine
:
it
was
plaited
under
the
idea
and
for
the
adornment
of
another
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
.
<EOS>
It
is
neither
necessary
,
nor
would
it
be
just
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
object
is
_
all
_
mine
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
object
is
yours
entirely
.
"
  
<EOS>
Straightway
Monsieur
opened
his
paletôt
,
arranged
the
guard
splendidly
across
his
chest
,
displaying
as
much
and
suppressing
as
little
as
he
could
:
for
he
had
no
notion
of
concealing
what
he
admired
and
thought
decorative
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
box
,
he
pronounced
it
a
superb
bonbonnière
 
<EOS>
he
was
fond
of
bonbons
,
by
the
way
 
<EOS>
and
as
he
always
liked
to
share
with
others
what
pleased
himself
,
he
would
give
his
"
dragées
"
as
freely
as
he
lent
his
books
.
<EOS>
Amongst
the
kind
brownie
's
gifts
left
in
my
desk
,
I
forgot
to
enumerate
many
a
paper
of
chocolate
comfits
.
<EOS>
His
tastes
in
these
matters
were
southern
,
and
what
we
think
infantine
.
<EOS>
His
simple
lunch
consisted
frequently
of
a
"
brioche
,
"
<EOS>
which
,
as
often
as
not
,
to
shared
with
some
child
of
the
third
division
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
présent
c'est
un
fait
accompli
,
"
said
he
,
re
-
adjusting
his
paletôt
;
and
we
had
no
more
words
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
After
looking
over
the
two
volumes
he
had
brought
,
and
cutting
away
some
pages
with
his
penknife
(
he
generally
pruned
before
lending
his
books
,
especially
if
they
were
novels
,
and
sometimes
I
was
a
little
provoked
at
the
severity
of
his
censorship
,
the
retrenchments
interrupting
the
narrative
)
,
he
rose
,
politely
touched
his
bonnet
-
grec
,
and
bade
me
a
civil
good
-
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
friends
now
,
"
thought
I
,
"
till
the
next
time
we
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
_
might
_
have
quarrelled
again
that
very
same
evening
,
but
,
wonderful
to
relate
,
failed
,
for
once
,
to
make
the
most
of
our
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
Contrary
to
all
expectation
,
M.
Paul
arrived
at
the
study
-
hour
.
<EOS>
Having
seen
so
much
of
him
in
the
morning
,
we
did
not
look
for
his
presence
at
night
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
were
we
seated
at
lessons
,
however
,
than
he
appeared
.
<EOS>
I
own
I
was
glad
to
see
him
,
so
glad
that
I
could
not
help
greeting
his
arrival
with
a
smile
;
and
when
he
made
his
way
to
the
same
seat
about
which
so
serious
a
misunderstanding
had
formerly
arisen
,
I
took
good
care
not
to
make
too
much
room
for
him
;
he
watched
with
a
jealous
,
side
-
long
look
,
to
see
whether
I
shrank
away
,
but
I
did
not
,
though
the
bench
was
a
little
crowded
.
<EOS>
I
was
losing
the
early
impulse
to
recoil
from
M.
Paul
.
<EOS>
Habituated
to
the
paletôt
and
bonnet
-
grec
,
the
neighbourhood
of
these
garments
seemed
no
longer
uncomfortable
or
very
formidable
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
now
sit
restrained
,
"
asphyxiée
"
(
as
he
used
to
say
)
at
his
side
<EOS>
;
I
stirred
when
I
wished
to
stir
,
coughed
when
it
was
necessary
,
even
yawned
when
I
was
tired
 
<EOS>
did
,
in
short
,
what
I
pleased
,
blindly
reliant
upon
his
indulgence
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
my
temerity
,
this
evening
at
least
,
meet
the
punishment
it
perhaps
merited
;
he
was
both
indulgent
and
good
-
natured
;
not
a
cross
glance
shot
from
his
eyes
,
not
a
hasty
word
left
his
lips
.
<EOS>
Till
the
very
close
of
the
evening
,
he
did
not
indeed
address
me
at
all
,
yet
I
felt
,
somehow
,
that
he
was
full
of
friendliness
.
<EOS>
Silence
is
of
different
kinds
,
and
breathes
different
meanings
;
no
words
could
inspire
a
pleasanter
content
than
did
M.
Paul
's
worldless
presence
.
<EOS>
When
the
tray
came
in
,
and
the
bustle
of
supper
commenced
,
he
just
said
,
as
he
retired
,
that
he
wished
me
a
good
night
and
sweet
dreams
;
and
a
good
night
and
sweet
dreams
<EOS>
I
had
.
    
<EOS>
M.
PAUL
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
the
reader
is
advised
not
to
be
in
any
hurry
with
his
kindly
conclusions
,
or
to
suppose
,
with
an
over
-
hasty
charity
,
that
from
that
day
M.
Paul
became
a
changed
character
 
easy
to
live
with
,
and
no
longer
apt
to
flash
danger
and
discomfort
round
him
.
  
<EOS>
No
;
he
was
naturally
a
little
man
of
unreasonable
moods
.
<EOS>
When
over
-
wrought
,
which
he
often
was
,
he
became
acutely
irritable
;
and
,
besides
,
his
veins
were
dark
with
a
livid
belladonna
tincture
,
the
essence
of
jealousy
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
merely
the
tender
jealousy
of
the
heart
,
but
that
sterner
,
narrower
sentiment
whose
seat
is
in
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
I
used
to
think
,
as
I
Sat
looking
at
M.
Paul
,
while
he
was
knitting
his
brow
or
protruding
his
lip
over
some
exercise
of
mine
,
which
had
not
as
many
faults
as
he
wished
<EOS>
(
for
he
liked
me
to
commit
faults
:
a
knot
of
blunders
was
sweet
to
him
as
a
cluster
of
nuts
)
,
that
he
had
points
of
resemblance
to
Napoleon
Bonaparte
.
<EOS>
I
think
so
still
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
shameless
disregard
of
magnanimity
,
he
resembled
the
great
Emperor
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
would
have
quarrelled
with
twenty
learned
women
,
would
have
unblushingly
carried
on
a
system
of
petty
bickering
and
recrimination
with
a
whole
capital
of
coteries
,
never
troubling
himself
about
loss
or
lack
of
dignity
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
exiled
fifty
Madame
de
Staëls
,
if
,
they
had
annoyed
,
offended
,
outrivalled
,
or
opposed
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
well
remember
a
hot
episode
of
his
with
a
certain
Madame
Panache
 
<EOS>
a
lady
temporarily
employed
by
Madame
Beck
to
give
lessons
in
history
.
<EOS>
She
was
clever
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
she
knew
a
good
deal
;
and
,
besides
,
thoroughly
possessed
the
art
of
making
the
most
of
what
she
knew
;
of
words
and
confidence
she
held
unlimited
command
.
<EOS>
Her
personal
appearance
was
far
from
destitute
of
advantages
;
I
believe
many
people
would
have
pronounced
her
"
a
fine
woman
;
"
and
yet
there
were
points
in
her
robust
and
ample
attractions
,
as
well
as
in
her
bustling
and
demonstrative
presence
,
which
,
it
appeared
,
the
nice
and
capricious
tastes
of
M.
Paul
could
not
away
with
.
<EOS>
The
sound
of
her
voice
,
echoing
through
the
carré
,
would
put
him
into
a
strange
taking
;
her
long
free
step
 
<EOS>
almost
stride
 
along
the
corridor
,
would
often
make
him
snatch
up
his
papers
and
decamp
on
the
instant
.
  
<EOS>
With
malicious
intent
he
bethought
himself
,
one
day
,
to
intrude
on
her
class
;
as
quick
as
lightning
he
gathered
her
method
of
instruction
;
it
differed
from
a
pet
plan
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
With
little
ceremony
,
and
less
courtesy
,
he
pointed
out
what
he
termed
her
errors
.
<EOS>
Whether
he
expected
submission
and
attention
,
I
know
not
;
he
met
an
acrid
opposition
,
accompanied
by
a
round
reprimand
for
his
certainly
unjustifiable
interference
.
  
<EOS>
Instead
of
withdrawing
with
dignity
,
as
he
might
still
have
done
,
he
threw
down
the
gauntlet
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
Madame
Panache
,
bellicose
as
a
Penthesilea
,
picked
it
up
in
a
minute
.
<EOS>
She
snapped
her
fingers
in
the
intermeddler
's
face
;
she
rushed
upon
him
with
a
storm
of
words
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
was
eloquent
;
but
Madame
Panache
was
voluble
.
<EOS>
A
system
of
fierce
antagonism
ensued
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
laughing
in
his
sleeve
at
his
fair
foe
,
with
all
her
sore
amour
-
propre
and
loud
self
-
assertion
,
M.
Paul
detested
her
with
intense
seriousness
;
he
honoured
her
with
his
earnest
fury
;
he
pursued
her
vindictively
and
implacably
,
refusing
to
rest
peaceably
in
his
bed
,
to
derive
due
benefit
from
his
meals
,
or
even
serenely
to
relish
his
cigar
,
till
she
was
fairly
rooted
out
of
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
The
Professor
conquered
,
but
I
can
not
say
that
the
laurels
of
this
victory
shadowed
gracefully
his
temples
.
<EOS>
Once
I
ventured
to
hint
as
much
.
<EOS>
To
my
great
surprise
he
allowed
that
I
might
be
right
,
but
averred
that
when
brought
into
contact
with
either
men
or
women
of
the
coarse
,
self
-
complacent
quality
,
whereof
Madame
Panache
was
a
specimen
,
he
had
no
control
over
his
own
passions
;
an
unspeakable
and
active
aversion
impelled
him
to
a
war
of
extermination
.
  
<EOS>
Three
months
afterwards
,
hearing
that
his
vanquished
foe
had
met
with
reverses
,
and
was
likely
to
be
really
distressed
for
want
of
employment
,
he
forgot
his
hatred
,
and
alike
active
in
good
and
evil
,
he
moved
heaven
and
earth
till
he
found
her
a
place
.
<EOS>
Upon
her
coming
to
make
up
former
differences
,
and
thank
him
for
his
recent
kindness
,
the
old
voice
 
a
little
loud
 
<EOS>
the
old
manner
 
a
little
forward
 
so
acted
upon
him
that
in
ten
minutes
he
started
up
and
bowed
her
,
or
rather
himself
,
out
of
the
room
,
in
a
transport
of
nervous
irritation
.
  
<EOS>
To
pursue
a
somewhat
audacious
parallel
,
in
a
love
of
power
,
in
an
eager
grasp
after
supremacy
,
M.
Emanuel
was
like
Bonaparte
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
not
always
to
be
submitted
to
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
it
was
needful
to
resist
;
it
was
right
to
stand
still
,
to
look
up
into
his
eyes
and
tell
him
that
his
requirements
went
beyond
reason
 
that
his
absolutism
verged
on
tyranny
.
  
<EOS>
The
dawnings
,
the
first
developments
of
peculiar
talent
appearing
within
his
range
,
and
under
his
rule
,
curiously
excited
,
even
disturbed
him
.
<EOS>
He
watched
its
struggle
into
life
with
a
scowl
;
he
held
back
his
hand
 
perhaps
said
,
"
Come
on
if
you
have
strength
,
"
but
would
not
aid
the
birth
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
pang
and
peril
of
the
first
conflict
were
over
,
when
the
breath
of
life
was
drawn
,
when
he
saw
the
lungs
expand
and
contract
,
when
he
felt
the
heart
beat
and
discovered
life
in
the
eye
,
he
did
not
yet
offer
to
foster
.
  
<EOS>
"
Prove
yourself
true
ere
<EOS>
I
cherish
you
<EOS>
,
"
was
his
ordinance
;
and
how
difficult
he
made
that
proof
!
<EOS>
What
thorns
and
briers
,
what
flints
,
he
strewed
in
the
path
of
feet
not
inured
to
rough
travel
!
<EOS>
He
watched
tearlessly
 
ordeals
that
he
exacted
should
be
passed
through
 
fearlessly
.
<EOS>
He
followed
footprints
that
,
as
they
approached
the
bourne
,
were
sometimes
marked
in
blood
 
followed
them
grimly
,
holding
the
austerest
police
-
watch
over
the
pain
-
pressed
pilgrim
.
<EOS>
And
when
at
last
he
allowed
a
rest
,
before
slumber
might
close
the
eyelids
,
he
opened
those
same
lids
wide
,
with
pitiless
finger
and
thumb
,
and
gazed
deep
through
the
pupil
and
the
irids
into
the
brain
,
into
the
heart
,
to
search
if
Vanity
,
or
Pride
,
or
Falsehood
,
in
any
of
its
subtlest
forms
,
was
discoverable
in
the
furthest
recess
of
existence
.
<EOS>
If
,
at
last
,
he
let
the
neophyte
sleep
,
it
was
but
a
moment
;
he
woke
him
suddenly
up
to
apply
new
tests
:
he
sent
him
on
irksome
errands
when
he
was
staggering
with
weariness
;
he
tried
the
temper
,
the
sense
,
and
the
health
;
and
it
was
only
when
every
severest
test
had
been
applied
and
endured
,
when
the
most
corrosive
aquafortis
had
been
used
,
and
failed
to
tarnish
the
ore
,
that
he
admitted
it
genuine
,
and
,
still
in
clouded
silence
,
stamped
it
with
his
deep
brand
of
approval
.
  
<EOS>
I
speak
not
ignorant
of
these
evils
.
  
<EOS>
Till
the
date
at
which
the
last
chapter
closes
,
M.
Paul
had
not
been
my
professor
 
<EOS>
he
had
not
given
me
lessons
,
but
about
that
time
,
accidentally
hearing
me
one
day
acknowledge
an
ignorance
of
some
branch
of
education
<EOS>
(
I
think
it
was
arithmetic
)
,
which
would
have
disgraced
a
charity
-
school
boy
,
as
he
very
truly
remarked
,
he
took
me
in
hand
,
examined
me
first
,
found
me
,
I
need
not
say
,
abundantly
deficient
,
gave
me
some
books
and
appointed
me
some
tasks
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
this
at
first
with
pleasure
,
indeed
with
unconcealed
exultation
,
condescending
to
say
that
he
believed
I
was
"
bonne
et
pas
trop
faible
"
(
i.e.
well
enough
disposed
,
and
not
wholly
destitute
of
parts
)
,
but
,
owing
he
supposed
to
adverse
circumstances
,
"
as
yet
in
a
state
of
wretchedly
imperfect
mental
development
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
beginning
of
all
effort
has
indeed
with
me
been
marked
by
a
preternatural
imbecility
.
<EOS>
I
never
could
,
even
in
forming
a
common
acquaintance
,
assert
or
prove
a
claim
to
average
quickness
.
<EOS>
A
depressing
and
difficult
passage
has
prefaced
every
new
page
I
have
turned
in
life
.
  
<EOS>
So
long
as
this
passage
lasted
,
M.
Paul
was
very
kind
,
very
good
,
<EOS>
very
forbearing
;
he
saw
the
sharp
pain
inflicted
,
and
felt
the
weighty
humiliation
imposed
by
my
own
sense
of
incapacity
;
and
words
can
hardly
do
justice
to
his
tenderness
and
helpfulness
.
<EOS>
His
own
eyes
would
moisten
,
when
tears
of
shame
and
effort
clouded
mine
;
burdened
as
he
was
with
work
,
he
would
steal
half
his
brief
space
of
recreation
to
give
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
strange
grief
!
<EOS>
when
that
heavy
and
overcast
dawn
began
at
last
to
yield
to
day
;
when
my
faculties
began
to
struggle
themselves
,
free
,
and
my
time
of
energy
and
fulfilment
came
;
when
I
voluntarily
doubled
,
trebled
,
quadrupled
the
tasks
he
set
,
to
please
him
as
I
thought
,
his
kindness
became
sternness
;
the
light
changed
in
his
eyes
from
a
beam
to
a
spark
<EOS>
;
he
fretted
,
he
opposed
,
he
curbed
me
imperiously
;
the
more
I
did
,
the
harder
I
worked
,
the
less
he
seemed
content
.
<EOS>
Sarcasms
of
which
the
severity
amazed
and
puzzled
me
,
harassed
my
ears
;
then
flowed
out
the
bitterest
inuendoes
against
the
"
pride
of
intellect
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
vaguely
threatened
with
I
know
not
what
doom
,
if
I
ever
trespassed
the
limits
proper
to
my
sex
,
and
conceived
a
contraband
appetite
for
unfeminine
knowledge
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
I
had
no
such
appetite
.
<EOS>
What
I
loved
,
it
joyed
me
by
any
effort
to
content
;
but
the
noble
hunger
for
science
in
the
abstract
 
the
godlike
thirst
after
discovery
 
<EOS>
these
feelings
were
known
to
me
but
by
briefest
flashes
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
,
when
M.
Paul
sneered
at
me
,
I
wanted
to
possess
them
more
fully
;
<EOS>
his
injustice
stirred
in
me
ambitious
wishes
 
it
imparted
a
strong
stimulus
 
<EOS>
it
gave
wings
to
aspiration
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
beginning
,
before
I
had
penetrated
to
motives
,
that
uncomprehended
sneer
of
his
made
my
heart
ache
,
but
by
-
and
-
<EOS>
by
it
only
warmed
the
blood
in
my
veins
,
and
sent
added
action
to
my
pulses
.
<EOS>
Whatever
my
powers
 
feminine
or
the
contrary
 
<EOS>
God
had
given
them
,
and
I
felt
resolute
to
be
ashamed
of
no
faculty
of
his
bestowal
.
  
<EOS>
The
combat
was
very
sharp
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
I
seemed
to
have
lost
M.
Paul
's
affection
;
he
treated
me
strangely
.
<EOS>
In
his
most
unjust
moments
he
would
insinuate
that
I
had
deceived
him
when
I
appeared
,
what
he
called
"
faible
"
 
that
is
incompetent
;
he
said
I
had
feigned
a
false
incapacity
.
<EOS>
Again
,
he
would
turn
suddenly
round
and
accuse
me
of
the
most
far
-
fetched
imitations
and
impossible
plagiarisms
,
asserting
that
I
had
extracted
the
pith
out
of
books
I
had
not
so
much
as
heard
of
 
and
over
the
perusal
of
which
I
should
infallibly
have
fallen
down
in
a
sleep
as
deep
as
that
of
Eutychus
.
  
<EOS>
Once
,
upon
his
preferring
such
an
accusation
,
I
turned
upon
him
 
I
rose
against
him
.
<EOS>
Gathering
an
armful
of
his
books
out
of
my
desk
,
I
filled
my
apron
and
poured
them
in
a
heap
upon
his
estrade
,
at
his
feet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
them
away
,
M.
Paul
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
teach
me
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
never
asked
to
be
made
learned
,
and
you
compel
me
to
feel
very
profoundly
that
learning
is
not
happiness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
returning
to
my
desk
,
I
laid
my
head
on
my
arms
,
nor
would
I
speak
to
him
for
two
days
afterwards
.
<EOS>
He
pained
and
chagrined
me
.
<EOS>
His
affection
had
been
very
sweet
and
dear
 
a
pleasure
new
and
incomparable
:
now
that
this
seemed
withdrawn
,
I
cared
not
for
his
lessons
.
  
<EOS>
The
books
,
however
,
were
not
taken
away
;
they
were
all
restored
with
careful
hand
to
their
places
,
and
he
came
as
usual
to
teach
me
.
<EOS>
He
made
his
peace
somehow
 
too
readily
,
perhaps
:
I
ought
to
have
stood
out
longer
,
but
when
he
looked
kind
and
good
,
and
held
out
his
hand
with
amity
,
memory
refused
to
reproduce
with
due
force
his
oppressive
moments
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
reconcilement
is
always
sweet
!
  
<EOS>
On
a
certain
morning
a
message
came
from
my
godmother
,
inviting
me
to
attend
some
notable
lecture
to
be
delivered
in
the
same
public
rooms
before
described
.
<EOS>
Dr.
John
had
brought
the
message
himself
,
and
delivered
it
verbally
to
Rosine
,
who
had
not
scrupled
to
follow
the
steps
of
M.
Emanuel
,
then
passing
to
the
first
classe
,
and
,
in
his
presence
,
stand
"
carrément
"
before
my
desk
,
hand
in
apron
-
pocket
,
and
rehearse
the
same
,
saucily
and
aloud
,
concluding
with
the
words
,
"
Qu'il
est
vraiment
beau
,
Mademoiselle
,
ce
jeune
docteur
!
<EOS>
Quels
yeux
 
<EOS>
quel
regard
!
<EOS>
Tenez
!
<EOS>
J'en
ai
le
coeur
tout
ému
!
"
  
<EOS>
When
she
was
gone
,
my
professor
demanded
of
me
why
I
suffered
"
cette
fille
effrontée
,
cette
créature
sans
pudeur
,
"
to
address
me
in
such
terms
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
no
pacifying
answer
to
give
.
<EOS>
The
terms
were
precisely
such
as
Rosine
 
a
young
lady
in
whose
skull
the
organs
of
reverence
and
reserve
were
not
largely
developed
 
was
in
the
constant
habit
of
using
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
what
she
said
about
the
young
doctor
was
true
enough
.
<EOS>
Graham
_
was
_
handsome
;
he
had
fine
eyes
and
a
thrilling
:
glance
.
<EOS>
An
observation
to
that
effect
actually
formed
itself
into
sound
on
my
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
Elle
ne
dit
que
la
vérité
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
vous
trouvez
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mais
,
sans
doute
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
lesson
to
which
we
had
that
day
to
submit
was
such
as
to
make
us
very
glad
when
it
terminated
.
<EOS>
At
its
close
,
the
released
,
pupils
rushed
out
,
half
-
trembling
,
half
-
exultant
.
<EOS>
I
,
too
,
was
going
.
<EOS>
A
mandate
to
remain
arrested
me
.
<EOS>
I
muttered
that
I
wanted
some
fresh
air
sadly
 
<EOS>
the
stove
was
in
a
glow
,
the
classe
over
-
heated
.
<EOS>
An
inexorable
voice
merely
recommended
silence
;
and
this
salamander
 
for
whom
no
room
ever
seemed
too
hot
 
sitting
down
between
my
desk
and
the
stove
 
a
situation
in
which
he
ought
to
have
felt
broiled
,
but
did
not
 
proceeded
to
confront
me
with
 
a
Greek
quotation
!
  
<EOS>
In
M.
Emanuel
's
soul
rankled
a
chronic
suspicion
that
I
knew
both
Greek
and
Latin
.
<EOS>
As
monkeys
are
said
to
have
the
power
of
speech
if
they
would
but
use
it
,
and
are
reported
to
conceal
this
faculty
in
fear
of
its
being
turned
to
their
detriment
,
so
to
me
was
ascribed
a
fund
of
knowledge
which
I
was
supposed
criminally
and
craftily
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
The
privileges
of
a
"
classical
education
,
"
it
was
insinuated
,
had
been
mine
;
on
flowers
of
Hymettus
I
had
revelled
;
a
golden
store
,
hived
in
memory
,
now
silently
sustained
my
efforts
,
and
privily
nurtured
my
wits
.
  
<EOS>
A
hundred
expedients
did
M.
Paul
employ
to
surprise
my
secret
 
to
wheedle
,
to
threaten
,
to
startle
it
out
of
me
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
placed
Greek
and
Latin
books
in
my
way
,
and
then
watched
me
,
as
Joan
of
Arc
's
jailors
tempted
her
with
the
warrior
's
accoutrements
,
and
lay
in
wait
for
the
issue
.
<EOS>
Again
he
quoted
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
authors
and
passages
,
and
while
rolling
out
their
sweet
and
sounding
lines
<EOS>
(
the
classic
tones
fell
musically
from
his
lips
 
for
he
had
a
good
voice
 
remarkable
for
compass
,
modulation
,
and
matchless
expression
)
,
he
would
fix
on
me
a
vigilant
,
piercing
,
and
often
malicious
eye
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
he
sometimes
expected
great
demonstrations
;
they
never
occurred
,
however
;
not
comprehending
,
of
course
I
could
neither
be
charmed
nor
annoyed
.
  
<EOS>
Baffled
 
almost
angry
 
he
still
clung
to
his
fixed
idea
;
my
susceptibilities
were
pronounced
marble
 
<EOS>
my
face
a
mask
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
as
if
he
could
not
be
brought
to
accept
the
homely
truth
,
and
take
me
for
what
I
was
:
men
,
and
women
too
,
must
have
delusion
of
some
sort
;
if
not
made
ready
to
their
hand
,
they
will
invent
exaggeration
for
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
At
moments
I
_
did
_
wish
that
his
suspicions
had
been
better
founded
.
<EOS>
There
were
times
when
I
would
have
given
my
right
hand
to
possess
the
treasures
he
ascribed
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
deserved
condign
punishment
for
his
testy
crotchets
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
gloried
in
bringing
home
to
him
his
worst
apprehensions
astoundingly
realized
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
exulted
to
burst
on
his
vision
,
confront
and
confound
his
"
lunettes
,
"
one
blaze
of
acquirements
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
why
did
nobody
undertake
to
make
me
clever
while
I
was
young
enough
to
learn
,
that
I
might
,
by
one
grand
,
sudden
,
inhuman
revelation
 
<EOS>
one
cold
,
cruel
,
overwhelming
triumph
 
<EOS>
have
for
ever
crushed
the
mocking
spirit
out
of
Paul
Carl
David
Emanuel
!
  
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
no
such
feat
was
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
,
as
usual
,
his
quotations
fell
ineffectual
:
he
soon
shifted
his
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
Women
of
intellect
"
was
his
next
theme
:
here
he
was
at
home
.
<EOS>
A
"
woman
of
intellect
,
"
it
appeared
,
was
a
sort
of
"
lusus
naturae
,
"
a
luckless
accident
,
a
thing
for
which
there
was
neither
place
nor
use
in
creation
,
wanted
neither
as
wife
nor
worker
.
<EOS>
Beauty
anticipated
her
in
the
first
office
.
<EOS>
He
believed
in
his
soul
that
lovely
,
placid
,
and
passive
feminine
mediocrity
was
the
only
pillow
on
which
manly
thought
and
sense
could
find
rest
for
its
aching
temples
;
and
as
to
work
,
male
mind
alone
could
work
to
any
good
practical
result
 
hein
?
  
<EOS>
This
"
hein
?
"
was
a
note
of
interrogation
intended
to
draw
from
me
contradiction
or
objection
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
only
said
 
"
<EOS>
Cela
<EOS>
ne
me
<EOS>
regarde
pas
:
<EOS>
je
ne
m'en
soucie
pas
;
"
and
presently
added
 
"
May
I
go
,
Monsieur
?
<EOS>
They
have
rung
the
bell
for
the
second
déjeuner
"
(
_
i.e.
_
luncheon
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
of
that
?
<EOS>
You
are
not
hungry
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
was
,
"
I
said
;
"
I
had
had
nothing
since
breakfast
,
at
seven
,
and
should
have
nothing
till
dinner
,
at
five
,
if
I
missed
this
bell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
he
was
in
the
same
plight
,
but
I
might
share
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
he
broke
in
two
the
"
brioche
"
intended
for
his
own
refreshment
,
and
gave
me
half
.
<EOS>
Truly
his
bark
was
worse
than
his
bite
;
but
the
really
formidable
attack
was
yet
to
come
.
<EOS>
While
eating
his
cake
,
I
could
not
forbear
expressing
my
secret
wish
that
I
really
knew
all
of
which
he
accused
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
sincerely
feel
myself
to
be
an
ignoramus
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
in
a
softened
tone
.
  
<EOS>
If
I
had
replied
meekly
by
an
unqualified
affirmative
,
I
believe
he
would
have
stretched
out
his
hand
,
and
we
should
have
been
friends
on
the
spot
,
but
I
answered
    
"
Not
exactly
.
<EOS>
I
am
ignorant
,
Monsieur
,
in
the
knowledge
you
ascribe
to
me
,
but
I
_
sometimes
_
,
not
_
always
_
,
feel
a
knowledge
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
I
mean
?
<EOS>
"
he
inquired
,
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
Unable
to
answer
this
question
in
a
breath
,
I
evaded
it
by
change
of
subject
.
<EOS>
He
had
now
finished
his
half
of
the
brioche
feeling
sure
that
on
so
trifling
a
fragment
he
could
not
have
satisfied
his
appetite
,
as
indeed
I
had
not
appeased
mine
,
and
inhaling
the
fragrance
of
baked
apples
afar
from
the
refectory
<EOS>
,
I
ventured
to
inquire
whether
he
did
not
also
perceive
that
agreeable
odour
.
<EOS>
He
confessed
that
he
did
.
<EOS>
I
said
if
he
would
let
me
out
by
the
garden
-
door
,
and
permit
me
just
to
run
across
the
court
,
I
would
fetch
him
a
plateful
;
and
added
that
I
believed
they
were
excellent
,
as
Goton
had
a
very
good
method
of
baking
,
or
rather
stewing
fruit
,
putting
in
a
little
spice
,
sugar
,
and
a
glass
or
two
of
vin
blanc
 
<EOS>
might
I
go
?
  
<EOS>
"
Petite
gourmande
!
"
said
he
,
smiling
,
"
I
have
not
forgotten
how
pleased
you
were
with
the
pâté
<EOS>
â
<EOS>
la
crême
<EOS>
I
once
gave
you
,
and
you
know
very
well
,
at
this
moment
,
that
to
fetch
the
apples
for
me
will
be
the
same
as
getting
them
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
Go
,
then
,
but
come
back
quickly
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
at
last
he
liberated
me
on
parole
.
<EOS>
My
own
plan
was
to
go
and
return
with
speed
and
good
faith
,
to
put
the
plate
in
at
the
door
,
and
then
to
vanish
incontinent
,
leaving
all
consequences
for
future
settlement
.
  
<EOS>
That
intolerably
keen
instinct
of
his
seemed
to
have
anticipated
my
scheme
:
he
met
me
at
the
threshold
,
hurried
me
into
the
room
,
and
fixed
me
in
a
minute
in
my
former
seat
.
<EOS>
Taking
the
plate
of
fruit
from
my
hand
,
he
divided
the
portion
intended
only
for
himself
,
and
ordered
me
to
eat
my
share
.
<EOS>
I
complied
with
no
good
grace
,
and
vexed
,
I
suppose
,
by
my
reluctance
,
he
opened
a
masked
and
dangerous
battery
.
<EOS>
All
he
had
yet
said
,
I
could
count
as
mere
sound
and
fury
,
signifying
nothing
:
not
so
of
the
present
attack
.
  
<EOS>
It
consisted
in
an
unreasonable
proposition
with
which
he
had
before
afflicted
me
:
<EOS>
namely
,
that
on
the
next
public
examination
-
day
I
should
engage
 
foreigner
as
I
was
 
to
take
my
place
on
the
first
form
of
first
-
class
pupils
,
and
with
them
improvise
a
composition
in
French
,
on
any
subject
any
spectator
might
dictate
,
without
benefit
of
grammar
or
lexicon
.
  
<EOS>
I
knew
what
the
result
of
such
an
experiment
would
be
.
<EOS>
I
,
to
whom
nature
had
denied
the
impromptu
faculty
;
who
,
in
public
,
was
by
nature
a
cypher
;
whose
time
of
mental
activity
,
even
when
alone
,
was
not
under
the
meridian
sun
;
who
needed
the
fresh
silence
of
morning
,
or
the
recluse
peace
of
evening
,
to
win
from
the
Creative
Impulse
one
evidence
of
his
presence
,
one
proof
of
his
force
;
I
,
with
whom
that
Impulse
was
the
most
intractable
,
the
most
capricious
,
the
most
maddening
of
masters
(
him
before
me
always
excepted
)
 
<EOS>
a
deity
which
sometimes
,
under
circumstances
 
apparently
propitious
,
would
not
speak
when
questioned
,
would
not
hear
when
appealed
to
,
would
not
,
when
sought
,
be
found
;
but
would
stand
,
all
cold
,
all
indurated
,
all
granite
,
a
dark
Baal
with
carven
lips
and
blank
eye
-
balls
,
and
breast
like
the
stone
face
of
a
tomb
;
and
again
,
suddenly
,
at
some
turn
,
some
sound
,
some
long
-
trembling
sob
of
the
wind
,
at
some
rushing
past
of
an
unseen
stream
of
electricity
,
the
irrational
demon
would
wake
unsolicited
,
would
stir
strangely
alive
,
would
rush
from
its
pedestal
like
a
perturbed
Dagon
,
calling
to
its
votary
for
a
sacrifice
,
whatever
the
hour
 
to
its
victim
for
some
blood
,
or
some
breath
,
<EOS>
whatever
the
circumstance
or
scene
 
rousing
its
priest
,
treacherously
promising
vaticination
,
perhaps
filling
its
temple
with
a
strange
hum
of
oracles
,
but
sure
to
give
half
the
significance
to
fateful
winds
,
and
grudging
to
the
desperate
listener
even
a
miserable
remnant
 
yielding
it
sordidly
,
as
though
each
word
had
been
a
drop
of
the
deathless
ichor
of
its
own
dark
veins
.
<EOS>
And
this
tyrant
I
was
to
compel
into
bondage
,
and
make
it
improvise
a
theme
,
on
a
school
estrade
,
between
a
Mathilde
and
a
Coralie
,
under
the
eye
of
a
Madame
Beck
,
for
the
pleasure
,
and
to
the
inspiration
of
a
bourgeois
of
Labassecour
!
  
<EOS>
Upon
this
argument
M.
Paul
and
I
did
battle
more
than
once
 
strong
battle
,
with
confused
noise
of
demand
and
rejection
,
exaction
and
repulse
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
particular
day
I
was
soundly
rated
.
<EOS>
"
The
obstinacy
of
my
whole
sex
,
"
it
seems
,
was
concentrated
in
me
;
I
had
an
"
orgueil
de
diable
.
<EOS>
"
I
feared
to
fail
,
forsooth
!
<EOS>
What
did
it
matter
whether
I
failed
or
not
?
<EOS>
Who
was
I
that
I
should
not
fail
,
like
my
betters
?
<EOS>
It
would
do
me
good
to
fail
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
to
see
me
worsted
<EOS>
(
I
knew
he
did
)
,
and
one
minute
he
paused
to
take
breath
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
I
speak
now
,
and
be
tractable
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
would
I
be
tractable
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
Law
itself
should
not
compel
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
pay
a
fine
,
or
undergo
an
imprisonment
,
rather
than
write
for
a
show
and
to
order
,
perched
up
on
a
platform
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Could
softer
motives
influence
me
?
<EOS>
Would
I
yield
for
friendship
's
sake
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
a
whit
,
not
a
hair
-
breadth
.
<EOS>
No
form
of
friendship
under
the
sun
had
a
right
to
exact
such
a
concession
.
<EOS>
No
true
friendship
would
harass
me
thus
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
supposed
then
(
with
a
sneer
 
<EOS>
M.
Paul
could
sneer
supremely
,
curling
his
lip
,
opening
his
nostrils
,
contracting
his
eyelids
)
 
<EOS>
he
supposed
there
was
<EOS>
but
one
form
of
appeal
to
which
I
would
listen
,
and
of
that
form
it
was
not
for
him
to
make
use
.
  
<EOS>
"
Under
certain
persuasions
,
from
certain
quarters
,
je
vous
vois
d'ici
,
"
said
he
,
"
eagerly
subscribing
to
the
sacrifice
,
passionately
arming
for
the
effort
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Making
a
simpleton
,
a
warning
,
and
an
example
of
myself
,
before
a
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
"
papas
'
and
"
mammas
'
of
Villette
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
here
,
losing
patience
,
I
broke
out
afresh
with
a
cry
that
I
wanted
to
be
liberated
 
to
get
out
into
the
air
 
<EOS>
I
was
almost
in
a
fever
.
  
<EOS>
"
Chut
!
"
said
the
inexorable
,
"
this
was
a
mere
pretext
to
run
away
;
_
he
_
was
not
hot
,
with
the
stove
close
at
his
back
;
how
could
I
suffer
,
thoroughly
screened
by
his
person
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
understand
his
constitution
.
<EOS>
I
knew
nothing
of
the
natural
history
of
salamanders
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
was
a
phlegmatic
islander
,
and
sitting
in
an
oven
did
not
agree
with
me
;
at
least
,
might
I
step
to
the
well
,
and
get
a
glass
of
water
 
<EOS>
the
sweet
apples
had
made
me
thirsty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
that
was
all
,
he
would
do
my
errand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
went
to
fetch
the
water
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
with
a
door
only
on
the
latch
behind
me
,
I
lost
not
my
opportunity
.
<EOS>
Ere
his
return
,
his
half
-
worried
prey
had
escaped
.
    
<EOS>
THE
DRYAD
.
  
<EOS>
The
spring
was
advancing
,
and
the
weather
had
turned
suddenly
warm
.
<EOS>
This
change
of
temperature
brought
with
it
for
me
,
as
probably
for
many
others
,
temporary
decrease
of
strength
.
<EOS>
Slight
exertion
at
this
time
left
me
overcome
with
fatigue
 
<EOS>
sleepless
nights
entailed
languid
days
.
  
<EOS>
One
Sunday
afternoon
,
having
walked
the
distance
of
half
a
league
to
the
Protestant
church
,
I
came
back
weary
and
exhausted
;
and
taking
refuge
in
my
solitary
sanctuary
,
the
first
classe
<EOS>
,
I
was
glad
to
sit
down
,
and
to
make
of
my
desk
a
pillow
for
my
arms
and
head
.
  
<EOS>
Awhile
I
listened
to
the
lullaby
of
bees
humming
in
the
berceau
,
and
watched
,
through
the
glass
door
and
the
tender
,
lightly
-
strewn
spring
foliage
,
Madame
Beck
and
a
gay
party
of
friends
,
whom
she
had
entertained
that
day
at
dinner
after
morning
mass
,
walking
in
the
centre
-
alley
under
orchard
boughs
dressed
at
this
season
in
blossom
,
and
wearing
a
colouring
as
pure
and
warm
as
mountain
-
snow
at
sun
-
rise
.
  
<EOS>
My
principal
attraction
towards
this
group
of
guests
lay
,
I
remember
,
in
one
figure
 
that
of
a
handsome
young
girl
whom
I
had
seen
before
as
a
visitor
at
Madame
Beck
's
,
and
of
whom
I
had
been
vaguely
told
that
she
was
a
"
filleule
,
"
or
god
-
daughter
,
of
M.
Emanuel
's
,
and
that
between
her
mother
,
or
aunt
,
or
some
other
female
relation
of
hers
,
and
the
Professor
,
had
existed
of
old
a
special
friendship
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
was
not
of
the
holiday
band
to
-
day
,
but
I
had
seen
this
young
girl
with
him
ere
now
,
and
as
far
as
distant
observation
could
enable
me
to
judge
,
she
seemed
to
enjoy
him
with
the
frank
ease
of
a
ward
with
an
indulgent
guardian
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
her
run
up
to
him
,
put
her
arm
through
his
,
and
hang
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Once
,
when
she
did
so
,
a
curious
sensation
had
struck
through
me
 
a
disagreeable
anticipatory
sensation
 
one
of
the
family
of
presentiments
,
I
suppose
 
<EOS>
but
I
refused
to
analyze
or
dwell
upon
it
.
<EOS>
While
watching
this
girl
,
Mademoiselle
Sauveur
by
name
,
and
following
the
gleam
of
her
bright
silk
robe
<EOS>
(
she
was
always
richly
dressed
,
for
she
was
said
to
be
wealthy
)
through
the
flowers
and
the
glancing
leaves
of
tender
emerald
,
my
eyes
became
dazzled
 
<EOS>
they
closed
;
my
lassitude
,
the
warmth
of
the
day
,
the
hum
of
bees
and
birds
,
all
lulled
me
,
and
at
last
I
slept
.
  
<EOS>
Two
hours
stole
over
me
.
<EOS>
Ere
<EOS>
I
woke
,
the
sun
had
declined
out
of
sight
behind
the
towering
houses
,
the
garden
and
the
room
were
grey
,
bees
had
gone
homeward
,
and
the
flowers
were
closing
;
the
party
of
guests
,
too
,
had
vanished
;
each
alley
was
void
.
  
<EOS>
On
waking
,
I
felt
much
at
ease
 
not
chill
,
as
I
ought
to
have
been
after
sitting
so
still
for
at
least
two
hours
;
my
cheek
and
arms
were
not
benumbed
by
pressure
against
the
hard
desk
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
the
bare
wood
on
which
I
had
laid
them
,
I
found
a
thick
shawl
,
carefully
folded
,
substituted
for
support
,
and
another
shawl
(
both
taken
from
the
corridor
where
such
things
hung
)
wrapped
warmly
round
me
.
  
<EOS>
Who
had
done
this
?
<EOS>
Who
was
my
friend
?
<EOS>
Which
of
the
teachers
?
<EOS>
Which
of
the
pupils
?
<EOS>
None
,
except
St.
Pierre
,
was
inimical
to
me
;
but
which
of
them
had
the
art
,
the
thought
,
the
habit
,
of
benefiting
thus
tenderly
?
<EOS>
Which
of
them
had
a
step
so
quiet
,
a
hand
so
gentle
,
but
I
should
have
heard
or
felt
her
,
if
she
had
approached
or
touched
me
in
a
day
-
sleep
?
  
<EOS>
As
to
Ginevra
Fanshawe
,
that
bright
young
creature
was
not
gentle
at
all
,
and
would
certainly
have
pulled
me
out
of
my
chair
,
if
she
had
meddled
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
said
at
last
:
"
It
is
Madame
Beck
's
doing
;
she
has
come
in
,
seen
me
asleep
,
and
thought
I
might
take
cold
.
<EOS>
She
considers
me
a
useful
machine
,
answering
well
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
hired
;
so
would
not
have
me
needlessly
injured
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
"
methought
,
"
I
'll
take
a
walk
;
the
evening
is
fresh
,
and
not
very
chill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
I
opened
the
glass
door
and
stepped
into
the
berceau
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
to
my
own
alley
:
<EOS>
had
it
been
dark
,
or
even
dusk
,
I
should
have
hardly
ventured
there
,
for
I
had
not
yet
forgotten
the
curious
illusion
of
vision
(
<EOS>
if
illusion
it
were
)
experienced
in
that
place
some
months
ago
.
<EOS>
But
a
ray
of
the
setting
sun
burnished
still
the
grey
crown
of
Jean
Baptiste
;
nor
had
all
the
birds
of
the
garden
yet
vanished
into
their
nests
amongst
the
tufted
shrubs
and
thick
wall
-
ivy
.
<EOS>
I
paced
up
and
down
,
thinking
almost
the
same
thoughts
I
had
pondered
that
night
when
I
buried
my
glass
jar
 
<EOS>
how
I
should
make
some
advance
in
life
,
take
another
step
towards
an
independent
position
;
for
this
train
of
reflection
,
though
not
lately
pursued
,
had
never
by
me
been
wholly
abandoned
;
and
whenever
a
certain
eye
was
averted
from
me
,
and
a
certain
countenance
grew
dark
with
unkindness
and
injustice
,
into
that
track
of
speculation
<EOS>
did
I
at
once
strike
;
so
that
,
little
by
little
,
I
had
laid
half
a
plan
.
  
<EOS>
"
Living
costs
little
,
"
said
I
to
myself
,
"
in
this
economical
town
of
Villette
,
where
people
are
more
sensible
than
I
understand
they
are
in
dear
old
England
 
infinitely
less
worried
about
appearance
,
and
less
emulous
of
display
 
where
nobody
is
in
the
least
ashamed
to
be
quite
as
homely
and
saving
as
he
finds
convenient
.
<EOS>
House
-
rent
,
in
a
prudently
chosen
situation
,
need
not
be
high
.
<EOS>
When
I
shall
have
saved
one
thousand
francs
,
I
will
take
a
tenement
with
one
large
room
,
and
two
or
three
smaller
ones
,
furnish
the
first
with
a
few
benches
and
desks
,
a
black
tableau
,
an
estrade
for
myself
;
upon
it
a
chair
and
table
,
with
a
sponge
and
some
white
chalks
;
begin
with
taking
day
-
pupils
,
and
so
work
my
way
upwards
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
's
commencement
was
 
as
I
have
often
heard
her
say
 
from
no
higher
starting
-
point
,
and
where
is
she
now
?
<EOS>
All
these
premises
and
this
garden
are
hers
,
bought
with
her
money
;
she
has
a
competency
already
secured
for
old
age
,
and
a
flourishing
establishment
under
her
direction
,
which
will
furnish
a
career
for
her
children
.
  
<EOS>
"
Courage
,
Lucy
Snowe
!
<EOS>
With
self
-
denial
and
economy
now
,
and
steady
exertion
by
-
and
-
by
,
an
object
in
life
need
not
fail
you
.
<EOS>
Venture
not
to
complain
that
such
an
object
is
too
selfish
,
too
limited
,
and
lacks
interest
<EOS>
;
be
content
to
labour
for
independence
until
you
have
proved
,
by
winning
that
prize
,
your
right
to
look
higher
.
<EOS>
But
afterwards
,
is
there
nothing
more
for
me
in
life
 
<EOS>
no
true
home
 
<EOS>
nothing
to
be
dearer
to
me
than
myself
,
and
by
its
paramount
preciousness
,
to
draw
from
me
better
things
than
I
care
to
culture
for
myself
only
?
<EOS>
Nothing
,
at
whose
feet
I
can
willingly
lay
down
the
whole
burden
of
human
egotism
,
and
gloriously
take
up
the
nobler
charge
of
labouring
and
living
for
others
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
Lucy
Snowe
,
the
orb
of
your
life
is
not
to
be
so
rounded
:
for
you
,
the
crescent
-
phase
must
suffice
.
<EOS>
Very
good
.
<EOS>
I
see
a
huge
mass
of
my
fellow
-
creatures
in
no
better
circumstances
.
<EOS>
I
see
that
a
great
many
men
,
and
more
women
,
hold
their
span
of
life
on
conditions
of
denial
and
privation
.
<EOS>
I
find
no
reason
why
I
should
be
of
the
few
favoured
.
<EOS>
I
believe
in
some
blending
of
hope
and
sunshine
sweetening
the
worst
lots
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
this
life
is
not
all
;
neither
the
beginning
nor
the
end
.
<EOS>
I
believe
while
I
tremble
;
I
trust
while
I
weep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
this
subject
is
done
with
.
<EOS>
It
is
right
to
look
our
life
-
accounts
bravely
in
the
face
now
and
then
,
and
settle
them
honestly
.
<EOS>
And
he
is
a
poor
self
-
swindler
who
lies
to
himself
while
he
reckons
the
items
,
and
sets
down
under
the
head
 
happiness
that
which
is
misery
.
<EOS>
Call
anguish
 
anguish
,
and
despair
 
despair
;
write
both
down
in
strong
characters
with
a
resolute
pen
:
you
will
the
better
pay
your
debt
to
Doom
.
<EOS>
Falsify
:
insert
"
privilege
"
where
you
should
have
written
"
pain
;
"
and
see
if
your
mighty
creditor
will
allow
the
fraud
to
pass
,
or
accept
the
coin
with
which
you
would
cheat
him
.
<EOS>
Offer
to
the
strongest
 
<EOS>
if
the
darkest
angel
of
God
's
host
 
water
,
when
he
has
asked
blood
 
will
he
take
it
?
<EOS>
Not
a
whole
pale
sea
for
one
red
drop
.
<EOS>
I
settled
another
account
.
  
<EOS>
Pausing
before
Methusaleh
 
the
giant
and
patriarch
of
the
garden
 
and
leaning
my
brow
against
his
knotty
trunk
,
my
foot
rested
on
the
stone
sealing
the
small
sepulchre
at
his
root
;
and
I
recalled
the
passage
of
feeling
therein
buried
;
I
recalled
Dr.
John
;
my
warm
affection
for
him
;
my
faith
in
his
excellence
;
my
delight
in
his
grace
.
<EOS>
What
was
become
of
that
curious
one
-
sided
friendship
which
was
half
marble
and
half
life
;
only
on
one
hand
truth
,
and
on
the
other
perhaps
a
jest
?
  
<EOS>
Was
this
feeling
dead
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
but
it
was
buried
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
thought
the
tomb
unquiet
,
and
dreamed
strangely
of
disturbed
earth
,
and
of
hair
,
still
golden
,
and
living
,
obtruded
through
coffin
-
chinks
.
  
<EOS>
Had
I
been
too
hasty
?
<EOS>
I
used
to
ask
myself
;
and
this
question
would
occur
with
a
cruel
sharpness
after
some
brief
chance
interview
with
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
He
had
still
such
kind
looks
,
such
a
warm
hand
;
his
voice
still
kept
so
pleasant
a
tone
for
my
name
;
I
never
liked
"
Lucy
"
so
well
as
when
he
uttered
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
learned
in
time
that
this
benignity
,
this
cordiality
,
this
music
,
belonged
in
no
shape
to
me
:
it
was
a
part
of
himself
;
it
was
the
honey
of
his
temper
;
it
was
the
balm
of
his
mellow
mood
;
he
imparted
it
,
as
the
ripe
fruit
rewards
with
sweetness
the
rifling
bee
;
he
diffused
it
about
him
,
as
sweet
plants
shed
their
perfume
.
<EOS>
Does
the
nectarine
love
either
the
bee
or
bird
<EOS>
it
feeds
?
<EOS>
Is
the
sweetbriar
enamoured
of
the
air
?
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
Dr.
John
;
you
are
good
,
you
are
beautiful
;
but
you
are
not
mine
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
and
God
bless
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Thus
I
closed
my
musings
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
-
night
"
left
my
lips
in
sound
;
I
heard
the
words
spoken
,
and
then
I
heard
an
echo
 
quite
close
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
Mademoiselle
;
or
,
rather
,
good
-
evening
 
<EOS>
the
sun
is
scarce
set
;
I
hope
you
slept
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
started
,
but
was
only
discomposed
a
moment
;
I
knew
the
voice
and
speaker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Slept
,
Monsieur
!
<EOS>
When
?
<EOS>
where
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
well
inquire
when
 
where
.
<EOS>
It
seems
you
turn
day
into
night
,
and
choose
a
desk
for
a
pillow
;
rather
hard
lodging
 
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
softened
for
me
,
Monsieur
,
while
I
slept
.
<EOS>
That
unseen
,
gift
-
bringing
thing
which
haunts
my
desk
,
remembered
me
.
<EOS>
No
matter
how
I
fell
asleep
;
I
awoke
pillowed
and
covered
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Did
the
shawls
keep
you
warm
?
"
  
"
Very
warm
.
<EOS>
Do
you
ask
thanks
for
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
You
looked
pale
in
your
slumbers
:
are
you
home
-
sick
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
be
home
-
sick
,
one
must
have
a
home
;
which
I
have
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
have
more
need
of
a
careful
friend
.
<EOS>
I
scarcely
know
any
one
,
Miss
Lucy
,
who
needs
a
friend
more
absolutely
than
you
;
your
very
faults
imperatively
require
it
.
<EOS>
You
want
so
much
checking
,
regulating
,
and
keeping
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
idea
of
"
keeping
down
"
never
left
M.
Paul
's
head
;
the
most
habitual
subjugation
would
,
in
my
case
,
have
failed
to
relieve
him
of
it
.
<EOS>
No
matter
;
what
did
it
signify
?
<EOS>
I
listened
to
him
,
and
did
not
trouble
myself
to
be
too
submissive
;
his
occupation
would
have
been
gone
<EOS>
had
<EOS>
I
left
him
nothing
to
"
keep
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
watching
,
and
watching
over
,
"
he
pursued
;
"
and
it
is
well
for
you
that
I
see
this
,
and
do
my
best
to
discharge
both
duties
.
<EOS>
I
watch
you
and
others
pretty
closely
,
pretty
constantly
,
nearer
and
oftener
than
you
or
they
think
.
<EOS>
Do
you
see
that
window
with
a
light
in
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
pointed
to
a
lattice
in
one
of
the
college
boarding
-
houses
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
,
"
said
he
,
"
is
a
room
I
have
hired
,
nominally
for
a
study
 
virtually
for
a
post
of
observation
.
<EOS>
There
I
sit
and
read
for
hours
together
:
it
is
my
way
 
my
taste
.
<EOS>
My
book
is
this
garden

its
contents
are
human

female
human

It

not

Comment
?
<EOS>
it
is
not
right
?
<EOS>
By
whose
creed
?
<EOS>
Does
some
dogma
of
Calvin
or
Luther
condemn
it
?
<EOS>
What
is
that
to
me
?
<EOS>
I
am
no
Protestant
.
<EOS>
My
rich
father
(
for
,
though
I
have
known
poverty
,
and
once
starved
for
a
year
in
a
garret
in
Rome

wretchedly
,
often
on
a
meal
a

sometimes
not
that
 
<EOS>

I
was
born
to
wealth

<EOS>
my
rich
father
was
a
good
Catholic
;
and
he
gave
me
a
priest
and
a
Jesuit
for
a
tutor
.
<EOS>
I
retain
his
lessons
;
and
to
what
discoveries
,
grand
Dieu
!
<EOS>
have
they
not
aided
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Discoveries
made
by
stealth
seem
to
me
dishonourable
discoveries
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Puritaine
!
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
not
.
<EOS>
Yet
see
how
my
Jesuit
's
system
works
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
St.
Pierre
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Partially
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
You
say
right
 
<EOS>
_
'
partially
'
_
;
whereas
_
I
<EOS>
_
know
her

<EOS>
thoroughly
_
;
there
is
the
difference
.
<EOS>
She
played
before
me
the
amiable
;
offered
me
patte
de
velours
;
caressed
,
flattered
,
fawned
on
me
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
am
accessible
to
a
woman
's
flattery
 
accessible
against
my
reason
.
<EOS>
Though
never
pretty
,
she
was
 
when
I
first
knew
her
 
young
,
or
knew
how
to
look
young
.
<EOS>
Like
all
her
countrywomen
,
she
had
the
art
of
dressing
 
<EOS>
she
had
a
certain
cool
,
easy
,
social
assurance
,
which
spared
me
the
pain
of
embarrassment
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Monsieur
,
that
must
have
been
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
you
embarrassed
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
,
you
know
little
of
me
;
I
can
be
embarrassed
as
a
petite
pensionnaire
;
there
is
a
fund
of
modesty
and
diffidence
in
my
nature
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Monsieur
,
I
never
saw
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
,
it
is
there
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
have
seen
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
I
have
observed
you
in
public
 
on
platforms
,
in
tribunes
,
before
titles
and
crowned
heads
 
<EOS>
and
you
were
as
easy
as
you
are
in
the
third
division
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
,
neither
titles
nor
crowned
heads
excite
my
modesty
;
and
publicity
is
very
much
my
element
.
<EOS>
I
like
it
well
,
and
breathe
in
it
quite
freely
;
 
but
 
but
,
in
short
,
here
is
the
sentiment
brought
into
action
,
at
this
very
moment
;
however
,
I
disdain
to
be
worsted
by
it
.
<EOS>
If
,
Mademoiselle
,
I
were
a
marrying
man
(
which
I
am
not
;
and
you
may
spare
yourself
the
trouble
of
any
sneer
you
may
be
contemplating
at
the
thought
)
,
and
found
it
necessary
to
ask
a
lady
whether
she
could
look
upon
me
in
the
light
of
a
future
husband
,
then
would
it
be
proved
that
I
am
as
I
say
 
modest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
quite
believed
him
now
;
and
,
in
believing
,
I
honoured
him
with
a
sincerity
of
esteem
which
made
my
heart
ache
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
the
St.
Pierre
,
"
he
went
on
,
recovering
himself
,
<EOS>
for
his
voice
had
altered
a
little
,
"
she
once
intended
to
be
Madame
Emanuel
;
and
I
do
n't
know
whither
I
might
have
been
led
,
but
for
yonder
little
lattice
with
the
light
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
magic
lattice
!
<EOS>
what
miracles
of
discovery
hast
thou
wrought
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
I
have
seen
her
rancours
,
her
vanities
,
her
levities
 
not
only
here
,
but
elsewhere
:
<EOS>
I
have
witnessed
what
bucklers
me
against
all
her
arts
:
I
am
safe
from
poor
Zélie
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
my
pupils
<EOS>
,
"
he
presently
recommenced
,
"
those
blondes
jeunes
filles
 
<EOS>
so
mild
and
meek
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
the
most
reserved
 
romp
like
boys
,
the
demurest
 
snatch
grapes
from
the
walls
,
shake
pears
from
the
trees
.
<EOS>
When
the
English
teacher
came
,
I
saw
her
,
marked
her
early
preference
for
this
alley
,
noticed
her
taste
for
seclusion
,
watched
her
well
,
long
before
she
and
I
came
to
speaking
terms
;
do
you
recollect
my
once
coming
silently
and
offering
you
a
little
knot
of
white
violets
when
we
were
strangers
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
recollect
it
.
<EOS>
I
dried
the
violets
,
kept
them
,
and
have
them
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
pleased
me
when
you
took
them
peacefully
and
promptly
,
without
prudery
 
that
sentiment
which
I
ever
dread
to
excite
,
and
which
,
when
it
is
revealed
in
eye
or
gesture
,
I
vindictively
detest
.
<EOS>
To
return
.
<EOS>
Not
only
did
_
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
_
watch
you
;
but
often
 
especially
at
eventide
 
<EOS>
another
guardian
angel
was
noiselessly
hovering
near
:
night
after
night
my
cousin
Beck
has
stolen
down
yonder
steps
,
and
glidingly
pursued
your
movements
when
you
did
not
see
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Monsieur
,
you
could
not
from
the
distance
of
that
window
<EOS>
see
what
passed
in
this
garden
at
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
By
moonlight
I
possibly
might
with
a
glass
 
<EOS>
I
use
a
glass
 
<EOS>
but
the
garden
itself
is
open
to
me
.
<EOS>
In
the
shed
,
at
the
bottom
,
there
is
a
door
leading
into
a
court
,
which
communicates
with
the
college
;
of
that
door
I
possess
the
key
,
and
thus
come
and
go
at
pleasure
.
<EOS>
This
afternoon
I
came
through
it
,
and
found
you
asleep
in
classe
;
again
this
evening
I
have
availed
myself
of
the
same
entrance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
saying
,
"
If
you
were
a
wicked
,
designing
man
,
how
terrible
would
all
this
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
attention
seemed
incapable
of
being
arrested
by
this
view
of
the
subject
:
he
lit
his
cigar
,
and
while
he
puffed
it
,
leaning
against
a
tree
,
and
looking
at
me
in
a
cool
,
amused
way
he
had
when
his
humour
was
tranquil
<EOS>
,
I
thought
proper
to
go
on
sermonizing
him
:
he
often
lectured
me
by
the
hour
together
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
see
why
I
should
not
speak
my
mind
for
once
.
<EOS>
So
I
told
him
my
impressions
concerning
his
Jesuit
-
system
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
knowledge
it
brings
you
is
bought
too
dear
,
Monsieur
;
this
coming
and
going
by
stealth
degrades
your
own
dignity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dignity
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
laughing
;
"
when
did
you
ever
see
me
trouble
my
head
about
my
dignity
?
<EOS>
It
is
you
,
Miss
Lucy
,
who
are
"
digne
.
<EOS>
"
How
often
,
in
your
high
insular
presence
,
have
I
taken
a
pleasure
in
trampling
upon
,
what
you
are
pleased
to
call
,
my
dignity
;
tearing
it
,
scattering
it
to
the
winds
,
in
those
mad
transports
you
witness
with
such
hauteur
,
and
<EOS>
which
I
know
you
think
very
like
the
ravings
of
a
third
-
rate
London
actor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
I
tell
you
every
glance
you
cast
from
that
lattice
<EOS>
is
a
wrong
done
to
the
best
part
of
your
own
nature
.
<EOS>
To
study
the
human
heart
thus
,
is
to
banquet
secretly
and
sacrilegiously
on
Eve
's
apples
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
were
a
Protestant
.
"
  
<EOS>
Indifferent
to
the
wish
,
he
smoked
on
.
<EOS>
After
a
space
of
smiling
yet
thoughtful
silence
,
he
said
,
rather
suddenly
 
"
I
have
seen
other
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
other
things
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Taking
the
weed
from
his
lips
,
he
threw
the
remnant
amongst
the
shrubs
,
where
,
for
a
moment
,
it
lay
glowing
in
the
gloom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
,
at
it
,
"
said
he
:
"
is
not
that
spark
like
an
eye
watching
you
and
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
a
turn
down
the
walk
;
presently
returning
,
he
went
on
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
,
Miss
Lucy
,
things
to
me
unaccountable
,
that
have
made
me
watch
all
night
for
a
solution
,
and
I
have
not
yet
found
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
tone
was
peculiar
;
my
veins
thrilled
;
he
saw
me
shiver
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
afraid
?
<EOS>
Whether
is
it
of
my
words
or
that
red
jealous
eye
just
winking
itself
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
cold
;
the
night
grows
dark
and
late
,
and
the
air
is
changed
;
it
is
time
to
go
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
little
past
eight
,
but
you
shall
go
in
soon
.
<EOS>
Answer
me
only
this
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Yet
he
paused
ere
<EOS>
he
put
it
.
<EOS>
The
garden
was
truly
growing
dark
;
dusk
had
come
on
with
clouds
,
and
drops
of
rain
began
to
patter
through
the
trees
.
<EOS>
I
hoped
he
would
feel
this
,
but
,
for
the
moment
,
he
seemed
too
much
absorbed
to
be
sensible
of
the
change
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
,
do
you
Protestants
believe
in
the
supernatural
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
difference
of
theory
and
belief
on
this
point
amongst
Protestants
as
amongst
other
sects

I
answered

<EOS>
"
Why
,
Monsieur
,
do
you
ask
such
a
question
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
shrink
and
speak
so
faintly
?
<EOS>
Are
you
superstitious
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
constitutionally
nervous
.
<EOS>
I
dislike
the
discussion
of
such
subjects
.
<EOS>
I
dislike
it
the
more
because
 
"
  
"
You
believe
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
:
but
it
has
happened
to
me
to
experience
impressions
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Since
you
came
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
not
many
months
ago
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Here
?
 
<EOS>
in
this
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bon
!
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
knew
it
,
somehow
;
before
you
told
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
conscious
of
rapport
between
you
and
myself
.
<EOS>
You
are
patient
,
and
I
am
choleric
;
you
are
quiet
and
pale
,
and
I
am
tanned
and
fiery
;
you
are
a
strict
Protestant
,
and
I
am
a
sort
of
lay
Jesuit
:
<EOS>
but
we
are
alike
 
<EOS>
there
is
affinity
between
us
.
<EOS>
Do
you
see
it
,
Mademoiselle
,
when
you
look
in
the
glass
?
<EOS>
Do
you
observe
that
your
forehead
is
shaped
like
mine
 
that
your
eyes
are
cut
like
mine
?
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
that
you
have
some
of
my
tones
of
voice
?
<EOS>
Do
you
know
that
you
have
many
of
my
looks
?
<EOS>
I
perceive
all
this
,
and
believe
that
you
were
born
under
my
star
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
you
were
born
under
my
star
!
<EOS>
Tremble
!
<EOS>
for
where
that
is
the
case
with
mortals
,
the
threads
of
their
destinies
are
difficult
to
disentangle
;
knottings
and
catchings
occur
 
sudden
breaks
leave
damage
in
the
web
.
<EOS>
But
these
"
impressions
,
"
as
you
say
,
with
English
caution
.
<EOS>
I
,
too
,
have
had
my
"
impressions
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Monsieur
,
tell
me
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
desire
no
better
,
and
intend
no
less
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
legend
of
this
house
and
garden
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
They
say
that
hundreds
of
years
ago
a
nun
was
buried
here
alive
at
the
foot
of
this
very
tree
,
beneath
the
ground
which
now
bears
us
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
that
in
former
days
a
nun
's
ghost
used
to
come
and
go
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Monsieur
,
what
if
it
comes
and
goes
here
still
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Something
comes
and
goes
here
:
there
is
a
shape
frequenting
this
house
by
night
,
different
to
any
forms
that
show
themselves
by
day
.
<EOS>
I
have
indisputably
seen
a
something
,
more
than
once
;
and
to
me
its
conventual
weeds
were
a
strange
sight
,
saying
more
than
they
can
do
to
any
other
living
being
.
<EOS>
A
nun
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
I
,
too
,
have
seen
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
anticipated
that
.
<EOS>
Whether
this
nun
be
flesh
and
blood
,
or
something
that
remains
when
blood
is
dried
,
and
flesh
is
wasted
,
her
business
is
as
much
with
you
as
with
me
,
probably
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
mean
to
make
it
out
;
it
has
baffled
me
so
far
,
but
I
mean
to
follow
up
the
mystery
.
<EOS>
I
mean
 
"
  
Instead
of
telling
what
he
meant
,
he
raised
his
head
suddenly
;
I
made
the
same
movement
in
the
same
instant
;
we
both
looked
to
one
point
 
the
high
tree
shadowing
the
great
berceau
,
and
resting
some
of
its
boughs
on
the
roof
of
the
first
classe
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
strange
and
inexplicable
sound
from
that
quarter
,
as
if
the
arms
of
that
tree
had
swayed
of
their
own
motion
,
and
its
weight
of
foliage
had
rushed
and
crushed
against
the
massive
trunk
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
there
scarce
stirred
a
breeze
,
and
that
heavy
tree
was
convulsed
,
whilst
the
feathery
shrubs
stood
still
.
<EOS>
For
some
minutes
amongst
the
wood
and
leafage
a
rending
and
heaving
went
on
.
<EOS>
Dark
as
it
was
,
it
seemed
to
me
that
something
more
solid
than
either
night
-
shadow
,
or
branch
-
shadow
,
blackened
out
of
the
boles
.
<EOS>
At
last
the
struggle
ceased
.
<EOS>
What
birth
succeeded
this
travail
?
<EOS>
What
Dryad
was
born
of
these
throes
?
<EOS>
We
watched
fixedly
.
<EOS>
A
sudden
bell
rang
in
the
house
 
<EOS>
the
prayer
-
bell
.
<EOS>
Instantly
into
our
alley
there
came
,
out
of
the
berceau
,
an
apparition
,
all
black
and
white
.
<EOS>
With
a
sort
of
angry
rush
-
close
,
close
past
our
faces
 
swept
swiftly
the
very
NUN
herself
!
<EOS>
Never
had
I
seen
her
so
clearly
.
<EOS>
She
looked
tall
of
stature
,
and
fierce
of
gesture
.
<EOS>
As
she
went
,
the
wind
rose
sobbing
;
the
rain
poured
wild
and
cold
;
the
whole
night
seemed
to
feel
her
.
    
<EOS>
THE
FIRST
LETTER
.
  
<EOS>
Where
,
it
becomes
time
to
inquire
,
was
Paulina
Mary
?
<EOS>
How
fared
my
intercourse
with
the
sumptuous
Hôtel
Crécy
?
<EOS>
That
intercourse
had
,
for
an
interval
,
been
suspended
by
absence
;
M.
and
Miss
de
Bassompierre
had
been
travelling
,
dividing
some
weeks
between
the
provinces
and
capital
of
France
.
<EOS>
Chance
apprised
me
of
their
return
very
shortly
after
it
took
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
walking
one
mild
afternoon
on
a
quiet
boulevard
,
wandering
slowly
on
,
enjoying
the
benign
April
sun
,
and
some
thoughts
not
unpleasing
,
when
I
saw
before
me
a
group
of
riders
,
stopping
as
if
they
had
just
encountered
,
and
exchanging
greetings
in
the
midst
of
the
broad
,
smooth
,
linden
-
bordered
path
;
on
one
side
a
middle
-
aged
gentleman
and
young
lady
,
on
the
other
 
a
young
and
handsome
man
.
<EOS>
Very
graceful
was
the
lady
's
mien
,
choice
her
appointments
,
delicate
and
stately
her
whole
aspect
.
<EOS>
Still
,
as
I
looked
,
I
felt
they
were
known
to
me
,
and
,
drawing
a
little
nearer
,
I
fully
recognised
them
all
:
the
Count
Home
de
Bassompierre
,
his
daughter
,
and
Dr.
Graham
Bretton
.
  
<EOS>
How
animated
was
Graham
's
face
!
<EOS>
How
true
,
how
warm
,
yet
how
retiring
the
joy
it
expressed
!
<EOS>
This
was
the
state
of
things
,
this
the
combination
of
circumstances
,
at
once
to
attract
and
enchain
,
to
subdue
and
excite
Dr.
John
.
<EOS>
The
pearl
he
admired
was
in
itself
of
great
price
and
truest
purity
,
but
he
was
not
the
man
who
,
in
appreciating
the
gem
,
could
forget
its
setting
.
<EOS>
Had
he
seen
Paulina
with
the
same
youth
,
beauty
,
and
grace
,
but
on
foot
,
alone
,
unguarded
,
and
in
simple
attire
,
a
dependent
worker
,
a
demi
-
grisette
,
he
would
have
thought
her
a
pretty
little
creature
,
and
would
have
loved
with
his
eye
her
movements
and
her
mien
,
but
it
required
other
than
this
to
conquer
him
as
he
was
now
vanquished
,
to
bring
him
safe
under
dominion
as
now
,
without
loss
,
and
even
with
gain
to
his
manly
honour
,
one
saw
that
he
was
reduced
;
there
was
about
Dr.
John
all
the
man
of
the
world
;
to
satisfy
himself
did
not
suffice
;
society
must
approve
 
<EOS>
the
world
must
admire
what
he
did
,
or
he
counted
his
measures
false
and
futile
.
<EOS>
In
his
victrix
he
required
all
that
was
here
visible
 
<EOS>
the
imprint
of
high
cultivation
,
the
consecration
of
a
careful
and
authoritative
protection
,
the
adjuncts
that
Fashion
decrees
,
Wealth
purchases
,
and
Taste
adjusts
;
for
these
conditions
his
spirit
stipulated
ere
<EOS>
it
surrendered
:
they
were
here
to
the
utmost
fulfilled
;
and
now
,
proud
,
impassioned
,
yet
fearing
,
he
did
homage
to
Paulina
as
his
sovereign
.
<EOS>
As
for
her
,
the
smile
of
feeling
,
rather
than
of
conscious
power
,
slept
soft
in
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
They
parted
.
<EOS>
He
passed
me
at
speed
,
hardly
feeling
the
earth
he
skimmed
,
and
seeing
nothing
on
either
hand
.
<EOS>
He
looked
very
handsome
;
mettle
and
purpose
were
roused
in
him
fully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
there
is
Lucy
!
"
<EOS>
cried
a
musical
,
friendly
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Lucy
,
dear
Lucy
 
_
do
_
come
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
hastened
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
threw
back
her
veil
,
and
stooped
from
her
saddle
to
kiss
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
coming
to
see
you
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
she
;
"
but
now
to
-
morrow
you
will
come
and
see
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
named
the
hour
,
and
I
promised
compliance
.
  
<EOS>
The
morrow
's
evening
found
me
with
her
 
<EOS>
she
<EOS>
and
I
shut
into
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
seen
her
since
that
occasion
when
her
claims
were
brought
into
comparison
with
those
of
Ginevra
Fanshawe
,
and
had
so
signally
prevailed
;
she
had
much
to
tell
me
of
her
travels
in
the
interval
.
<EOS>
A
most
animated
,
rapid
speaker
was
she
in
such
a
tête
-
à
-
tête
,
a
most
lively
describer
;
yet
with
her
artless
diction
and
clear
soft
voice
,
she
never
seemed
to
speak
too
fast
or
to
say
too
much
.
<EOS>
My
own
attention
<EOS>
I
think
would
not
soon
have
flagged
,
but
by
-
and
-
by
,
she
herself
seemed
to
need
some
change
of
subject
;
she
hastened
to
wind
up
her
narrative
briefly
.
<EOS>
Yet
why
she
terminated
with
so
concise
an
abridgment
did
not
immediately
appear
;
silence
followed
 
a
restless
silence
,
not
without
symptoms
of
abstraction
.
<EOS>
Then
,
turning
to
me
,
in
a
diffident
,
half
-
appealing
voice
 
<EOS>
"
Lucy
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
,
I
am
at
your
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
my
cousin
Ginevra
still
at
Madame
Beck
's
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
cousin
is
still
there
;
you
must
be
longing
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
not
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
invite
her
to
spend
another
evening
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
...
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
still
talks
about
being
married
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
to
any
one
you
care
for
.
"
  
"
But
of
course
she
still
thinks
of
Dr.
Bretton
?
<EOS>
She
can
not
have
changed
her
mind
on
that
point
,
because
it
was
so
fixed
two
months
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
know
,
it
does
not
matter
.
<EOS>
You
saw
the
terms
on
which
they
stood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
little
misunderstanding
that
evening
,
certainly
;
does
she
seem
unhappy
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
she
.
<EOS>
To
change
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
or
seen
nothing
of
,
or
from
.
<EOS>
Graham
during
your
absence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
had
letters
from
him
once
or
twice
about
business
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
He
undertook
the
management
of
some
affair
which
required
attention
while
we
were
away
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Bretton
seems
to
respect
papa
,
and
to
have
pleasure
in
obliging
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
:
you
met
him
yesterday
on
the
boulevard
;
you
would
be
able
to
judge
from
his
aspect
that
his
friends
need
not
be
painfully
anxious
about
his
health
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Papa
seems
to
have
thought
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
smiling
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
particularly
observant
,
you
know
,
because
he
is
often
thinking
of
other
things
than
what
pass
before
his
eyes
;
but
he
said
,
as
Dr.
Bretton
rode
away
,
"
Really
it
does
a
man
good
to
see
the
spirit
and
energy
of
that
boy
.
"
<EOS>
He
called
Dr.
Bretton
a
boy
;
I
believe
he
almost
thinks
him
so
,
just
as
he
thinks
me
a
little
girl
;
he
was
not
speaking
to
me
,
but
dropped
that
remark
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Lucy
....
<EOS>
"
  
Again
fell
the
appealing
accent
,
and
at
the
same
instant
she
left
her
chair
,
and
came
and
sat
on
the
stool
at
my
feet
.
  
<EOS>
I
liked
her
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
a
declaration
I
have
often
made
concerning
my
acquaintance
,
in
the
course
of
this
book
:
the
reader
will
bear
with
it
for
once
.
<EOS>
Intimate
intercourse
,
close
inspection
,
disclosed
in
Paulina
only
what
was
delicate
,
intelligent
,
and
sincere
;
therefore
my
regard
for
her
lay
deep
.
<EOS>
An
admiration
more
superficial
might
have
been
more
demonstrative
;
mine
,
however
,
was
quiet
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
to
ask
of
Lucy
?
"
<EOS>
said
I
;
"
be
brave
,
and
speak
out
"
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
courage
in
her
eye
;
as
it
met
mine
,
it
fell
;
and
there
was
no
coolness
on
her
cheek
 
not
a
transient
surface
-
blush
,
but
a
gathering
inward
excitement
raised
its
tint
and
its
temperature
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
I
_
do
_
wish
to
know
your
thoughts
of
Dr.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
Do
,
_
do
_
give
me
your
real
opinion
of
his
character
,
his
disposition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
character
stands
high
,
and
deservedly
high
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
his
disposition
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
about
his
disposition
,
"
she
urged
;
"
you
know
him
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
him
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
his
home
-
side
.
<EOS>
You
have
seen
him
with
his
mother
;
speak
of
him
as
a
son
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
fine
-
hearted
son
;
his
mother
's
comfort
and
hope
,
her
pride
and
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
held
my
hand
between
hers
,
and
at
each
favourable
word
gave
it
a
little
caressing
stroke
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
what
other
way
is
he
good
,
Lucy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dr.
Bretton
is
benevolent
 
humanely
disposed
towards
all
his
race
,
Dr.
Bretton
would
have
benignity
for
the
lowest
savage
,
or
the
worst
criminal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
heard
some
gentlemen
,
some
of
papa
's
friends
,
who
were
talking
about
him
,
say
the
same
.
<EOS>
They
say
many
of
the
poor
patients
at
the
hospitals
,
who
tremble
before
some
pitiless
and
selfish
surgeons
,
welcome
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
right
;
I
have
witnessed
as
much
.
<EOS>
He
once
took
me
over
a
hospital
;
I
saw
how
he
was
received
:
your
father
's
friends
are
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
softest
gratitude
animated
her
eye
as
she
lifted
it
a
moment
.
<EOS>
She
had
yet
more
to
say
,
but
seemed
hesitating
about
time
and
place
.
<EOS>
Dusk
was
beginning
to
reign
;
her
parlour
fire
already
glowed
with
twilight
ruddiness
;
but
I
thought
she
wished
the
room
dimmer
,
the
hour
later
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
quiet
and
secluded
we
feel
here
!
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
,
to
reassure
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
we
?
<EOS>
Yes
;
it
is
a
still
evening
,
and
I
shall
not
be
called
down
to
tea
;
papa
is
dining
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
Still
holding
my
hand
,
she
played
with
the
fingers
unconsciously
,
dressed
them
,
now
in
her
own
rings
,
and
now
circled
them
with
a
twine
of
her
beautiful
hair
;
she
patted
the
palm
against
her
hot
cheek
,
and
at
last
,
having
cleared
a
voice
that
was
naturally
liquid
as
a
lark
's
,
she
said
:
    
"
You
must
think
it
rather
strange
that
I
should
talk
so
much
about
Dr.
Bretton
,
ask
so
many
questions
,
take
such
an
interest
,
but
 
"
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
strange
;
perfectly
natural
;
you
like
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
I
did
,
"
said
she
,
with
slight
quickness
,
"
is
that
a
reason
why
I
should
talk
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
think
me
weak
,
like
my
cousin
Ginevra
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
thought
you
one
whit
like
Madame
Ginevra
,
I
would
not
sit
here
waiting
for
your
communications
.
<EOS>
I
would
get
up
,
walk
at
my
ease
about
the
room
,
and
anticipate
all
you
had
to
say
by
a
round
lecture
.
<EOS>
Go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
go
on
,
"
retorted
she
;
"
what
else
do
you
suppose
I
mean
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
she
looked
and
spoke
 
the
little
Polly
of
Bretton
 
petulant
,
sensitive
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
,
"
said
she
,
emphatically
,
"
if
I
liked
Dr.
John
till
I
was
fit
to
die
for
liking
him
,
that
alone
could
not
license
me
to
be
otherwise
than
dumb
 
dumb
as
the
grave
 
<EOS>
dumb
as
you
,
Lucy
Snowe
 
<EOS>
you
know
it
 
<EOS>
and
you
know
you
would
despise
me
if
I
failed
in
self
-
control
,
and
whined
about
some
rickety
liking
that
was
all
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
I
little
respect
women
or
girls
who
are
loquacious
either
in
boasting
the
triumphs
,
or
bemoaning
the
mortifications
,
of
feelings
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
you
,
Paulina
,
speak
,
for
I
earnestly
wish
to
hear
you
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
all
it
will
give
you
pleasure
or
relief
to
tell
:
I
ask
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
care
for
me
,
Lucy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
,
Paulina
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
I
had
an
odd
content
in
being
with
you
even
when
I
was
a
little
,
troublesome
,
disobedient
girl
;
it
was
charming
to
me
then
to
lavish
on
you
my
naughtiness
and
whims
.
<EOS>
Now
you
are
acceptable
to
me
,
and
I
like
to
talk
with
and
trust
you
.
<EOS>
So
listen
,
Lucy
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
she
settled
herself
,
resting
against
my
arm
 
resting
gently
,
not
with
honest
Mistress
Fanshawe
's
fatiguing
and
selfish
weight
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
few
minutes
since
you
asked
whether
we
had
not
heard
from
Graham
during
our
absence
,
<EOS>
and
I
said
there
were
two
letters
for
papa
on
business
;
this
was
true
,
but
I
did
not
tell
you
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
evaded
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shuffled
and
equivocated
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
am
going
to
speak
the
truth
now
;
it
is
getting
darker
;
one
can
talk
at
one
's
ease
.
<EOS>
Papa
often
lets
me
open
the
letter
-
bag
and
give
him
out
the
contents
.
<EOS>
One
morning
,
about
three
weeks
ago
,
you
do
n't
know
how
surprised
I
was
to
find
,
amongst
a
dozen
letters
for
M.
de
Bassompierre
,
a
note
addressed
to
Miss
de
Bassompierre
.
<EOS>
I
spied
it
at
once
,
amidst
all
the
rest
;
the
handwriting
was
not
strange
;
it
attracted
me
directly
.
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
say
,
"
Papa
,
here
is
another
letter
from
Dr.
Bretton
;
"
but
the
"
Miss
'
struck
me
mute
.
<EOS>
I
actually
never
received
a
letter
from
a
gentleman
before
.
<EOS>
Ought
I
to
have
shown
it
to
papa
,
and
let
him
open
it
and
read
it
first
?
<EOS>
I
could
not
for
my
life
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
so
well
papa
's
ideas
about
me
<EOS>
:
he
forgets
my
age
;
he
thinks
I
am
a
mere
school
-
girl
;
he
is
not
aware
that
other
people
see
I
am
grown
up
as
tall
as
I
shall
be
;
so
,
with
a
curious
mixture
of
feelings
,
some
of
them
self
-
reproachful
,
and
some
so
fluttering
and
strong
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
describe
them
,
I
gave
papa
his
twelve
letters
 
his
herd
of
possessions
 
and
kept
back
my
one
,
my
ewe
-
lamb
.
<EOS>
It
lay
in
my
lap
during
breakfast
,
looking
up
at
me
with
an
inexplicable
meaning
,
making
me
feel
myself
a
thing
double
-
existent
 
a
child
to
that
dear
papa
,
but
no
more
a
child
to
myself
.
<EOS>
After
breakfast
I
carried
my
letter
up
-
stairs
,
and
having
secured
myself
by
turning
the
key
in
the
door
,
I
began
to
study
the
outside
of
my
treasure
:
it
was
some
minutes
before
I
could
get
over
the
direction
and
penetrate
the
seal
;
one
does
not
take
a
strong
place
of
this
kind
by
instant
storm
 
<EOS>
one
sits
down
awhile
before
it
,
as
beleaguers
say
.
<EOS>
Graham
's
hand
is
like
himself
,
Lucy
,
and
so
is
his
seal
 
<EOS>
all
clear
,
firm
,
and
rounded
 
no
slovenly
splash
of
wax
 
<EOS>
a
full
,
solid
,
steady
drop
 
a
distinct
impress
;
no
pointed
turns
harshly
pricking
the
optic
nerve
,
but
a
clean
,
mellow
,
pleasant
manuscript
,
that
soothes
you
as
you
read
.
<EOS>
It
is
like
his
face
 
just
like
the
chiselling
of
his
features
:
do
you
know
his
autograph
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
it
:
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
seal
was
too
beautiful
to
be
broken
,
so
I
cut
it
round
with
my
scissors
.
<EOS>
On
the
point
of
reading
the
letter
at
last
,
I
once
more
drew
back
voluntarily
;
it
was
too
soon
yet
to
drink
that
draught
 
<EOS>
the
sparkle
in
the
cup
was
so
beautiful
 
<EOS>
I
would
watch
it
yet
a
minute
.
<EOS>
Then
I
remembered
all
at
once
that
I
had
not
said
my
prayers
that
morning
.
<EOS>
Having
heard
papa
go
down
to
breakfast
a
little
earlier
than
usual
,
I
had
been
afraid
of
keeping
him
waiting
,
and
had
hastened
to
join
him
as
soon
as
dressed
,
thinking
no
harm
to
put
off
prayers
till
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Some
people
would
say
I
ought
to
have
served
God
first
and
then
man
;
but
I
do
n't
think
heaven
could
be
jealous
of
anything
I
might
do
for
papa
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
am
superstitious
.
<EOS>
A
voice
seemed
now
to
say
that
another
feeling
than
filial
affection
was
in
question
 
to
urge
me
to
pray
before
I
dared
to
read
what
I
so
longed
to
read
 
to
deny
myself
yet
a
moment
,
and
remember
first
a
great
duty
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
these
impulses
ever
since
I
can
remember
.
<EOS>
I
put
the
letter
down
and
said
my
prayers
,
adding
,
at
the
end
,
a
strong
entreaty
that
whatever
happened
,
I
might
not
be
tempted
or
led
to
cause
papa
any
sorrow
,
and
might
never
,
in
caring
for
others
,
neglect
him
.
<EOS>
The
very
thought
of
such
a
possibility
,
so
pierced
my
heart
that
it
made
me
cry
.
<EOS>
But
still
,
Lucy
,
I
felt
that
in
time
papa
would
have
to
be
taught
the
truth
,
managed
,
and
induced
to
hear
reason
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
read
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
life
is
said
to
be
all
disappointment
.
<EOS>
_
I
_
was
not
disappointed
.
<EOS>
Ere
I
read
,
and
while
I
read
,
my
heart
did
more
than
throb
 
<EOS>
it
trembled
fast
 
every
quiver
seemed
like
the
pant
of
an
animal
athirst
,
laid
down
at
a
well
and
drinking
;
and
the
well
proved
quite
full
,
gloriously
clear
;
it
rose
up
munificently
of
its
own
impulse
;
I
saw
the
sun
through
its
gush
,
and
not
a
mote
,
Lucy
,
no
moss
,
no
insect
,
no
atom
in
the
thrice
-
refined
golden
gurgle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Life
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
is
said
to
be
full
of
pain
to
some
.
<EOS>
I
have
read
biographies
where
the
wayfarer
seemed
to
journey
on
from
suffering
to
suffering
;
where
Hope
flew
before
him
fast
,
never
alighting
so
near
,
or
lingering
so
long
,
as
to
give
his
hand
a
chance
of
one
realizing
grasp
.
<EOS>
I
have
read
of
those
who
sowed
in
tears
,
and
whose
harvest
,
so
far
from
being
reaped
in
joy
,
perished
by
untimely
blight
,
or
was
borne
off
by
sudden
whirlwind
;
and
,
alas
!
<EOS>
some
of
these
met
the
winter
with
empty
garners
,
and
died
of
utter
want
in
the
darkest
and
coldest
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
their
fault
,
Paulina
,
that
they
of
whom
you
speak
thus
died
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
always
their
fault
.
<EOS>
Some
of
them
were
good
endeavouring
people
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
endeavouring
,
nor
actively
good
,
yet
God
has
caused
me
to
grow
in
sun
,
due
moisture
,
and
safe
protection
,
sheltered
,
fostered
,
taught
,
by
my
dear
father
;
and
now
 
now
 
another
comes
.
<EOS>
Graham
loves
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
some
minutes
we
both
paused
on
this
climax
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
your
father
know
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Graham
spoke
with
deep
respect
of
papa
,
but
implied
that
he
dared
not
approach
that
quarter
as
yet
;
he
must
first
prove
his
worth
:
he
added
that
he
must
have
some
light
respecting
myself
and
my
own
feelings
ere
he
ventured
to
risk
a
step
in
the
matter
elsewhere
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
did
you
reply
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
replied
briefly
,
but
I
did
not
repulse
him
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
almost
trembled
for
fear
of
making
the
answer
too
cordial
:
Graham
's
tastes
are
so
fastidious
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
it
three
times
 
chastening
and
subduing
the
phrases
at
every
rescript
;
at
last
,
having
confected
it
till
it
seemed
to
me
to
resemble
a
morsel
of
ice
flavoured
with
ever
so
slight
a
zest
of
fruit
or
sugar
,
I
ventured
to
seal
and
despatch
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Excellent
,
Paulina
!
<EOS>
Your
instinct
is
fine
;
you
understand
Dr.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
must
I
manage
about
papa
?
<EOS>
There
I
am
still
in
pain
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
not
manage
at
all
.
<EOS>
Wait
now
.
<EOS>
Only
maintain
no
further
correspondence
till
your
father
knows
all
,
and
gives
his
sanction

"
Will
he
ever
give
it
?

<EOS>
"
Time
will
show

<EOS>
Wait

<EOS>
"
  
"
Dr.
Bretton
wrote
one
other
letter
,
deeply
grateful
for
my
calm
,
brief
note
;
but
I
anticipated
your
advice
,
by
saying
,
that
while
my
sentiments
continued
the
same
,
I
could
not
,
without
my
fathers
knowledge
,
write
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
acted
as
you
ought
to
have
done
;
so
Dr.
Bretton
will
feel
:
it
will
increase
his
pride
in
you
,
his
love
for
you
,
if
either
be
capable
of
increase
.
<EOS>
Paulina
,
that
gentle
hoar
-
frost
of
yours

surrounding
so
much
pure

fine
flame

is
a
priceless
privilege
of
nature

<EOS>
"
You
see
I
feel
Graham
's
disposition
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
feel
that
no
delicacy
can
be
too
exquisite
for
his
treatment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
perfectly
proved
that
you
comprehend
him
,
and
then
 
whatever
Dr.
Bretton
's
disposition
,
were
he
one
who
expected
to
be
more
nearly

Lucy

I
trust
I
shall
thus
act
always

Oh
,
it
will
be
pain
to
wake
papa
from
his
dream
,
and
tell
him
I
am
no
more
a
little
girl
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Be
in
no
hurry
to
do
so
,
Paulina
.
<EOS>
Leave
the
revelation
to
Time
and
your
kind
Fate
.
<EOS>
I
also
have
noticed
the
gentleness
of
her
cares
for
you
:
doubt
not
she
will
benignantly
order
the
circumstances
,
and
fitly
appoint
the
hour
.
<EOS>
Yes
:
I
have
thought
over
your
life
<EOS>
just
as
you
have
yourself
thought
it
over
;
I
have
made
comparisons
like
those
to
which
you
adverted
.
<EOS>
We
know
not
the
future
,
but
the
past
has
been
propitious

<EOS>
"
As
a
child
I
feared
for
you
;
nothing
that
has
life
was
ever
more
susceptible
than
your
nature
in
infancy
:
under
harshness
or
neglect
,
neither
your
outward
nor
your
inward
self
would
have
ripened
to
what
they
now
are
.
<EOS>
Much
pain
,
much
fear
,
much
struggle
,
would
have
troubled
the
very
lines
of
your
features
,
broken
their
regularity
,
would
have
harassed
your
nerves
into
the
fever
of
habitual
irritation
you
would
have
lost
in
health
and
cheerfulness
,
in
grace
and
sweetness
.
<EOS>
Providence
has
protected
and
cultured
you
,
not
only
for
your
own
sake
,
but
I
believe
for
Graham
's
.
<EOS>
His
star
,
too
,
was
fortunate
:
to
develop
fully
the
best
of
his
nature
,
a
companion
like
you
was
needed
:
there
you
are
,
ready
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
united
.
<EOS>
I
knew
it
the
first
day
I
saw
you
together
at
La
Terrasse
.
<EOS>
In
all
that
mutually
concerns
you
and
Graham
there
seems
to
me
promise
,
plan
,
harmony
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
the
sunny
youth
of
either
will
prove
the
forerunner
of
stormy
age
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
deemed
good
that
you
two
should
live
in
peace
and
be
happy
 
not
as
angels
,
but
as
few
are
happy
amongst
mortals
.
<EOS>
Some
lives
_
are
_
thus
blessed
:
it
is
God
's
will
:
it
is
the
attesting
trace
and
lingering
evidence
of
Eden
.
<EOS>
Other
lives
run
from
the
first
another
course
.
<EOS>
Other
travellers
encounter
weather
fitful
and
gusty
,
wild
and
variable
 
breast
adverse
winds
,
are
belated
and
overtaken
by
the
early
closing
winter
night
.
<EOS>
Neither
can
this
happen
without
the
sanction
of
God
;
and
I
know
that
,
amidst
His
boundless
works
,
is
somewhere
stored
the
secret
of
this
last
fate
's
justice
:
<EOS>
I
know
that
His
treasures
contain
the
proof
as
the
promise
of
its
mercy

M.
PAUL
KEEPS
HIS
PROMISE
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
first
of
May
,
we
had
all
 
i.e.
the
twenty
boarders
and
the
four
teachers
 
notice
to
rise
at
five
o'clock
of
the
morning
,
to
be
dressed
and
ready
by
six
,
to
put
ourselves
under
the
command
of
M.
le
Professeur
Emanuel
,
who
was
to
head
our
march
forth
from
Villette
,
for
it
was
on
this
day
he
proposed
to
fulfil
his
promise
of
taking
us
to
breakfast
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
,
indeed
,
as
the
reader
may
perhaps
remember
,
had
not
had
the
honour
of
an
invitation
when
this
excursion
was
first
projected
 
rather
the
contrary
;
but
on
my
now
making
allusion
to
this
fact
,
and
wishing
to
know
how
it
was
to
be
,
my
ear
received
a
pull
,
of
which
I
did
not
venture
to
challenge
the
repetition
by
raising
,
further
difficulties
.
  
<EOS>
"
Je
vous
conseille
de
vous
faire
prier
,
"
said
M.
Emanuel
,
imperially
menacing
the
other
ear
.
<EOS>
One
Napoleonic
compliment
,
however
,
was
enough
,
so
I
made
up
my
mind
to
be
of
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
The
morning
broke
calm
as
summer
,
with
singing
of
birds
in
the
garden
,
and
a
light
dew
-
mist
that
promised
heat
.
<EOS>
We
all
said
it
would
be
warm
,
and
we
all
felt
pleasure
in
folding
away
heavy
garments
,
and
in
assuming
the
attire
suiting
a
sunny
season
.
<EOS>
The
clean
fresh
print
dress
,
and
the
light
straw
bonnet
,
each
made
and
trimmed
as
the
French
workwoman
alone
can
make
and
trim
,
so
as
to
unite
the
utterly
unpretending
with
the
perfectly
becoming
,
was
the
rule
of
costume
.
<EOS>
Nobody
flaunted
in
faded
silk
;
nobody
wore
a
second
-
hand
best
article
.
  
<EOS>
At
six
the
bell
rang
merrily
,
and
we
poured
down
the
staircase
,
through
the
carré
,
along
the
corridor
,
into
the
vestibule
.
<EOS>
There
stood
our
Professor
,
wearing
,
not
his
savage
-
looking
paletôt
and
severe
bonnet
-
grec
,
but
a
young
-
looking
belted
blouse
and
cheerful
straw
hat
.
<EOS>
He
had
for
us
all
the
kindest
good
-
morrow
,
and
most
of
us
for
him
had
a
thanksgiving
smile
.
<EOS>
We
were
marshalled
in
order
and
soon
started
.
  
<EOS>
The
streets
were
yet
quiet
,
and
the
boulevards
were
fresh
and
peaceful
as
fields
.
<EOS>
I
believe
we
were
very
happy
as
we
walked
along
.
<EOS>
This
chief
of
ours
had
the
secret
of
giving
a
certain
impetus
to
happiness
when
he
would
;
just
as
,
in
an
opposite
mood
,
he
could
give
a
thrill
to
fear
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
lead
nor
follow
us
,
but
walked
along
the
line
,
giving
a
word
to
every
one
,
talking
much
to
his
favourites
,
and
not
wholly
neglecting
even
those
he
disliked
.
<EOS>
It
was
rather
my
wish
,
for
a
reason
I
had
,
to
keep
slightly
aloof
from
notice
,
and
being
paired
with
Ginevra
Fanshawe
,
bearing
on
my
arm
the
dear
pressure
of
that
angel
's
not
unsubstantial
limb
 
<EOS>
(
she
continued
in
excellent
case
,
and
I
can
assure
the
reader
it
was
no
trifling
business
to
bear
the
burden
of
her
loveliness
;
many
a
time
in
the
course
of
that
warm
day
I
wished
to
goodness
<EOS>
there
had
been
less
of
the
charming
commodity
)
 
however
,
having
her
,
as
I
said
,
I
tried
to
make
her
useful
by
interposing
her
always
between
myself
and
M.
Paul
,
shifting
my
place
,
according
as
I
heard
him
coming
up
to
the
right
hand
or
the
left
.
<EOS>
My
private
motive
for
this
manoeuvre
might
be
traced
to
the
circumstance
of
the
new
print
dress
I
wore
,
being
pink
in
colour
 
<EOS>
a
fact
which
,
under
our
present
convoy
,
made
me
feel
something
as
I
have
felt
,
when
,
clad
in
a
shawl
with
a
red
border
,
necessitated
to
traverse
a
meadow
where
pastured
a
bull
.
  
<EOS>
For
awhile
,
the
shifting
system
,
together
with
some
modifications
in
the
arrangement
of
a
black
silk
scarf
,
answered
my
purpose
;
but
,
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
,
he
found
out
,
that
whether
he
came
to
this
side
or
to
that
,
Miss
Fanshawe
was
still
his
neighbour
.
<EOS>
The
course
of
acquaintance
between
Ginevra
and
him
had
never
run
so
smooth
that
his
temper
did
not
undergo
a
certain
crisping
process
whenever
he
heard
her
English
accent
:
<EOS>
nothing
in
their
dispositions
fitted
;
they
jarred
if
they
came
in
contact
;
he
held
her
empty
and
affected
;
she
deemed
him
bearish
,
meddling
,
repellent
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
when
he
had
changed
his
place
for
about
the
sixth
time
,
finding
still
the
same
untoward
result
to
the
experiment
 
<EOS>
he
thrust
his
head
forward
,
settled
his
eyes
on
mine
,
and
demanded
with
impatience
,
"
Qu'est
-
ce
que
c'est
?
<EOS>
Vous
me
jouez
des
tours
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
,
however
,
ere
,
with
his
customary
quickness
,
he
seized
the
root
of
this
proceeding
:
in
vain
I
shook
out
the
long
fringe
,
and
spread
forth
the
broad
end
of
my
scarf
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
-
h
-
h
!
<EOS>
c'est
la
robe
rose
!
"
<EOS>
broke
from
his
lips
,
affecting
me
very
much
like
the
sudden
and
irate
low
of
some
lord
of
the
meadow
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
only
cotton
,
"
I
alleged
,
hurriedly
;
"
and
cheaper
,
and
washes
better
than
any
other
colour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Et
Mademoiselle
Lucy
est
coquette
comme
dix
Parisiennes
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
A
-
t
-
on
jamais
vu
une
<EOS>
Anglaise
pareille
.
<EOS>
Regardez
plutôt
son
chapeau
,
et
ses
gants
,
<EOS>
et
ses
brodequins
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
These
articles
of
dress
were
just
like
what
my
companions
wore
;
certainly
not
one
whit
smarter
 
perhaps
rather
plainer
than
most
 
<EOS>
but
Monsieur
had
now
got
hold
of
his
text
,
and
I
began
to
chafe
under
the
expected
sermon
.
<EOS>
It
went
off
,
however
,
as
mildly
as
the
menace
of
a
storm
sometimes
passes
on
a
summer
day
.
<EOS>
I
got
but
<EOS>
one
flash
of
sheet
lightning
in
the
shape
of
a
single
bantering
smile
from
his
eyes
;
<EOS>
and
then
he
said
,
"
Courage
!
 
<EOS>
à
vrai
dire
je
<EOS>
ne
suis
pas
fâché
,
peut
-
être
même
suis
je
content
<EOS>
qu'on
<EOS>
s'est
fait
si
belle
pour
ma
petite
fête
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mais
ma
robe
n'est
pas
belle
,
Monsieur
 
elle
n'est
que
propre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
J'aime
la
propreté
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
was
not
to
be
dissatisfied
;
the
sun
of
good
humour
was
to
triumph
on
this
auspicious
morning
;
it
consumed
scudding
clouds
ere
<EOS>
they
sullied
its
disk
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
we
were
in
the
country
,
amongst
what
they
called
"
les
bois
<EOS>
et
les
petits
sentiers
.
<EOS>
"
These
woods
and
lanes
a
month
later
would
offer
but
a
dusty
and
doubtful
seclusion
:
now
,
however
,
in
their
May
greenness
and
morning
repose
,
they
looked
very
pleasant
.
  
<EOS>
We
reached
a
certain
well
,
planted
round
,
in
the
taste
of
Labassecour
,
with
an
orderly
circle
of
lime
-
trees
:
here
a
halt
was
called
;
on
the
green
swell
of
ground
surrounding
this
well
,
we
were
ordered
to
be
seated
,
Monsieur
taking
his
place
in
our
midst
,
and
suffering
us
to
gather
in
a
knot
round
him
.
<EOS>
Those
who
liked
him
more
than
they
feared
,
came
close
,
and
these
were
chiefly
little
ones
;
those
who
feared
more
than
they
liked
,
kept
somewhat
aloof
;
those
in
whom
much
affection
had
given
,
even
to
what
remained
of
fear
,
a
pleasurable
zest
,
observed
the
greatest
distance
.
  
<EOS>
He
began
to
tell
us
a
story
.
<EOS>
Well
could
he
narrate
:
in
such
a
diction
as
children
love
,
and
learned
men
emulate
;
a
diction
simple
in
its
strength
,
and
strong
in
its
simplicity
.
<EOS>
There
were
beautiful
touches
in
that
little
tale
;
sweet
glimpses
of
feeling
and
hues
of
description
that
,
while
I
listened
,
sunk
into
my
mind
,
and
since
have
never
faded
.
<EOS>
He
tinted
a
twilight
scene
 
<EOS>
I
hold
it
in
memory
still
 
such
a
picture
I
have
never
looked
on
from
artist
's
pencil
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
said
,
that
,
for
myself
,
I
had
no
impromptu
faculty
;
and
perhaps
that
very
deficiency
made
me
marvel
the
more
at
one
who
possessed
it
in
perfection
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
was
not
a
man
to
write
books
;
but
I
have
heard
him
lavish
,
with
careless
,
unconscious
prodigality
,
such
mental
wealth
as
books
seldom
boast
;
his
mind
was
indeed
my
library
,
and
whenever
it
was
opened
to
me
,
I
entered
bliss
.
<EOS>
Intellectually
imperfect
as
I
was
,
I
could
read
little
;
there
were
few
bound
and
printed
volumes
that
did
not
weary
me
 
whose
perusal
did
not
fag
and
blind
 
but
<EOS>
his
tomes
of
thought
were
collyrium
to
the
spirit
's
eyes
;
over
their
contents
,
inward
sight
grew
clear
and
strong
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
think
what
a
delight
it
would
be
for
one
who
loved
him
better
than
he
loved
himself
,
to
gather
and
store
up
those
handfuls
of
gold
-
dust
,
so
recklessly
flung
to
heaven
's
reckless
winds
.
  
<EOS>
His
story
done
,
he
approached
the
little
knoll
where
I
and
Ginevra
sat
apart
.
<EOS>
In
his
usual
mode
of
demanding
an
opinion
(
he
had
not
reticence
to
wait
till
it
was
voluntarily
offered
)
he
asked
,
"
Were
you
interested
?
"
  
<EOS>
According
to
my
wonted
undemonstrative
fashion
,
I
simply
answered
 
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
good
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
I
could
not
write
that
down
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
,
Monsieur
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
the
mechanical
labour
;
I
hate
to
stoop
and
sit
still
.
<EOS>
I
could
dictate
it
,
though
,
with
pleasure
,
to
an
amanuensis
who
suited
me
.
<EOS>
Would
Mademoiselle
Lucy
write
for
me
if
I
asked
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
would
be
too
quick
;
he
would
urge
me
,
and
be
angry
if
my
pen
did
not
keep
pace
with
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Try
some
day
;
let
us
see
the
monster
I
can
make
of
myself
under
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
But
just
now
,
there
is
no
question
of
dictation
;
I
mean
to
make
you
useful
in
another
office
.
<EOS>
Do
you
see
yonder
farm
-
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Surrounded
with
trees
?
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
we
are
to
breakfast
;
and
while
the
good
fermière
makes
the
café
au
lait
in
a
caldron
,
you
and
five
others
,
whom
I
shall
select
,
will
spread
with
butter
half
a
hundred
rolls
.
<EOS>
"
  
Having
formed
his
troop
into
line
once
more
,
he
marched
us
straight
on
the
farm
,
which
,
on
seeing
our
force
,
surrendered
without
capitulation
.
  
<EOS>
Clean
knives
and
plates
,
and
fresh
butter
being
provided
,
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
us
,
chosen
by
our
Professor
,
set
to
work
under
his
directions
,
to
prepare
for
breakfast
a
huge
basket
of
rolls
,
with
which
the
baker
had
been
ordered
to
provision
the
farm
,
in
anticipation
of
our
coming
.
<EOS>
Coffee
and
chocolate
were
already
made
hot
;
cream
and
new
-
laid
eggs
were
added
to
the
treat
,
and
M.
Emanuel
,
always
generous
,
would
have
given
a
large
order
for
"
jambon
"
and
"
confitures
"
in
addition
,
but
that
some
of
us
,
who
presumed
perhaps
upon
our
influence
,
insisted
that
it
would
be
a
most
reckless
waste
of
victual
.
<EOS>
He
railed
at
us
for
our
pains
,
terming
us
"
des
ménagères
avares
;
"
but
we
let
him
talk
,
and
managed
the
economy
of
the
repast
our
own
way
.
  
<EOS>
With
what
a
pleasant
countenance
he
stood
on
the
farm
-
kitchen
hearth
looking
on
!
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
whom
it
made
happy
to
see
others
happy
;
he
liked
to
have
movement
,
animation
,
abundance
and
enjoyment
round
him
.
<EOS>
We
asked
where
he
would
sit
.
<EOS>
He
told
us
,
we
knew
well
he
was
our
slave
,
and
we
his
tyrants
,
and
that
he
dared
not
so
much
as
choose
a
chair
without
our
leave
;
so
we
set
him
the
farmer
's
great
chair
at
the
head
of
the
long
table
,
and
put
him
into
it
.
  
<EOS>
Well
might
we
like
him
,
with
all
his
passions
and
hurricanes
,
when
he
could
be
so
benignant
and
docile
at
times
,
as
he
was
just
now
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
at
the
worst
,
it
was
only
his
nerves
that
were
irritable
,
not
his
temper
that
was
radically
bad
;
soothe
,
comprehend
,
comfort
him
,
and
he
was
a
lamb
;
he
would
not
harm
a
fly
.
<EOS>
Only
to
the
very
stupid
,
perverse
,
or
unsympathizing
,
was
he
in
the
slightest
degree
dangerous
.
  
<EOS>
Mindful
always
of
his
religion
,
he
made
the
youngest
of
the
party
say
a
little
prayer
before
we
began
breakfast
,
crossing
himself
as
devotedly
as
a
woman
.
<EOS>
I
had
never
seen
him
pray
before
,
or
make
that
pious
sign
;
he
did
it
so
simply
,
with
such
child
-
like
faith
,
I
could
not
help
smiling
pleasurably
as
I
watched
;
his
eyes
met
my
smile
;
he
just
stretched
out
his
kind
hand
,
saying
,
"
Donnez
-
moi
la
main
!
<EOS>
I
see
we
worship
the
same
God
,
in
the
same
spirit
,
though
by
different
rites
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Most
of
M.
Emanuel
's
brother
Professors
were
emancipated
free
-
thinkers
,
infidels
,
atheists
;
and
many
of
them
men
whose
lives
would
not
bear
scrutiny
;
he
was
more
like
a
knight
of
old
,
religious
in
his
way
,
and
of
spotless
fame
.
<EOS>
Innocent
childhood
,
beautiful
youth
were
safe
at
his
side
.
<EOS>
He
had
vivid
passions
,
keen
feelings
,
but
his
pure
honour
and
his
artless
piety
were
the
strong
charm
that
kept
the
lions
couchant
.
  
<EOS>
That
breakfast
was
a
merry
meal
,
and
the
merriment
was
not
mere
vacant
clatter
:
M.
Paul
originated
,
led
,
controlled
and
heightened
it
;
his
social
,
lively
temper
played
unfettered
and
unclouded
;
surrounded
only
by
women
and
children
there
was
nothing
to
cross
and
thwart
him
;
he
had
his
own
way
,
and
a
pleasant
way
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
The
meal
over
,
the
party
were
free
to
run
and
play
in
the
meadows
;
a
few
stayed
to
help
the
farmer
's
wife
to
put
away
her
earthenware
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
called
me
from
among
these
to
come
out
and
sit
near
him
under
a
tree
 
<EOS>
whence
he
could
view
the
troop
gambolling
,
over
a
wide
pasture
 
and
read
to
him
whilst
he
took
his
cigar
.
<EOS>
He
sat
on
a
rustic
bench
,
and
I
at
the
tree
-
root
.
<EOS>
While
I
read
(
a
pocket
-
classic
 
<EOS>
a
Corneille
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
like
it
,
but
he
did
,
finding
therein
beauties
I
never
could
be
brought
to
perceive
)
<EOS>
,
he
listened
with
a
sweetness
of
calm
the
more
impressive
from
the
impetuosity
of
his
general
nature
;
the
deepest
happiness
filled
his
blue
eye
and
smoothed
his
broad
forehead
.
<EOS>
I
,
too
,
was
happy
 
<EOS>
happy
with
the
bright
day
,
happier
with
his
presence
,
happiest
with
his
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
He
asked
,
by
-
and
-
by
,
if
I
would
not
rather
run
to
my
companions
than
sit
there
?
<EOS>
I
said
,
no
;
<EOS>
I
felt
content
to
be
where
he
was
.
<EOS>
He
asked
whether
,
if
I
were
his
sister
,
I
should
always
be
content
to
stay
with
a
brother
such
as
he
.
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
believed
I
should
;
and
I
felt
it
.
<EOS>
Again
,
he
inquired
whether
,
if
he
were
to
leave
Villette
,
and
go
far
away
,
I
should
be
sorry
;
and
I
dropped
Corneille
,
and
made
no
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Petite
soeur
,
"
said
he
;
"
how
long
could
you
remember
me
if
we
were
separated
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
,
Monsieur
,
I
can
never
tell
,
because
I
do
not
know
how
long
it
will
be
before
I
shall
cease
to
remember
everything
earthly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
to
go
beyond
seas
for
two
 
three
 
five
years
,
should
you
welcome
me
on
my
return
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
how
could
I
live
in
the
interval
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pourtant
j'ai
été
pour
vous
bien
dur
,
bien
exigeant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hid
my
face
with
the
book
,
for
it
was
covered
with
tears
.
<EOS>
I
asked
him
why
he
talked
so
;
and
he
said
he
would
talk
so
no
more
,
and
cheered
me
again
with
the
kindest
encouragement
.
<EOS>
Still
,
the
gentleness
with
which
he
treated
me
during
the
rest
of
the
day
,
went
somehow
to
my
heart
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
tender
.
<EOS>
It
was
mournful
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
he
had
been
abrupt
,
whimsical
,
and
irate
as
was
his
wo
nt
.
  
<EOS>
When
hot
noon
arrived
 
for
the
day
turned
out
as
we
had
anticipated
,
glowing
as
June
 
<EOS>
our
shepherd
collected
his
sheep
from
the
pasture
,
and
proceeded
to
lead
us
all
softly
home
.
<EOS>
But
we
had
a
whole
league
to
walk
,
thus
far
from
Villette
was
the
farm
where
he
had
breakfasted
;
the
children
,
especially
,
were
tired
with
their
play
;
the
spirits
of
most
flagged
at
the
prospect
of
this
mid
-
day
walk
over
chaussées
flinty
,
glaring
,
and
dusty
.
<EOS>
This
state
of
things
had
been
foreseen
and
provided
for
.
<EOS>
Just
beyond
the
boundary
of
the
farm
we
met
two
spacious
vehicles
coming
to
fetch
us
 
<EOS>
such
conveyances
as
are
hired
out
purposely
for
the
accommodation
of
school
-
parties
;
here
,
with
good
management
,
room
was
found
for
all
,
and
in
another
hour
M.
Paul
made
safe
consignment
of
his
charge
at
the
Rue
Fossette
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
a
pleasant
day
:
it
would
have
been
perfect
,
but
for
the
breathing
of
melancholy
which
had
dimmed
its
sunshine
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
That
tarnish
was
renewed
the
same
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Just
about
sunset
,
I
saw
M.
Emanuel
come
out
of
the
front
-
door
,
accompanied
by
Madame
Beck
.
<EOS>
They
paced
the
centre
-
alley
for
nearly
an
hour
,
talking
earnestly
:
he
 
looking
grave
,
yet
restless
;
she
 
wearing
an
amazed
,
expostulatory
,
dissuasive
air
.
  
<EOS>
I
wondered
what
was
under
discussion
;
and
when
Madame
Beck
re
-
entered
the
house
as
it
darkened
,
leaving
her
kinsman
Paul
yet
lingering
in
the
garden
,
I
said
to
myself
 
"
<EOS>
He
called
me
"
petite
soeur
"
this
morning
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
really
my
brother
,
how
I
should
like
to
go
to
him
just
now
,
and
ask
what
it
is
that
presses
on
his
mind
.
<EOS>
See
how
he
leans
against
that
tree
,
with
his
arms
crossed
and
his
brow
bent
.
<EOS>
He
wants
consolation
,
I
know
:
Madame
does
not
console
:
she
only
remonstrates
.
<EOS>
What
now
 
?
"
  
<EOS>
Starting
from
quiescence
to
action
,
M.
Paul
came
striding
erect
and
quick
down
the
garden
.
<EOS>
The
carré
doors
were
yet
open
:
I
thought
he
was
probably
going
to
water
the
orange
-
trees
in
the
tubs
,
after
his
occasional
custom
;
on
reaching
the
court
,
however
,
he
took
an
abrupt
turn
and
made
for
the
berceau
and
the
first
-
classe
glass
door
.
<EOS>
There
,
in
that
first
classe
I
was
,
thence
I
had
been
watching
him
;
but
there
I
could
not
find
courage
to
await
his
approach
.
<EOS>
He
had
turned
so
suddenly
,
he
strode
so
fast
,
he
looked
so
strange
;
the
coward
within
me
grew
pale
,
shrank
and
 
not
waiting
to
listen
to
reason
,
and
hearing
the
shrubs
crush
and
the
gravel
crunch
to
his
advance
 
<EOS>
she
was
gone
on
the
wings
of
panic
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
did
I
pause
till
I
had
taken
sanctuary
in
the
oratory
,
now
empty
.
<EOS>
Listening
there
with
beating
pulses
,
and
an
unaccountable
,
undefined
apprehension
,
I
heard
him
pass
through
all
the
schoolrooms
,
clashing
the
doors
impatiently
as
he
went
;
I
heard
him
invade
the
refectory
which
the
"
lecture
pieuse
"
was
now
holding
under
hallowed
constraint
;
I
heard
him
pronounce
these
words
 
<EOS>
"
Où
est
Mademoiselle
Lucie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
just
as
,
summoning
my
courage
,
I
was
preparing
to
go
down
and
do
what
,
after
all
,
I
most
wished
to
do
in
the
world
 
viz
.
,
<EOS>
meet
him
 
the
wiry
voice
of
St.
Pierre
replied
glibly
and
falsely
,
"
Elle
est
au
lit
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
passed
,
with
the
stamp
of
vexation
,
into
the
corridor
.
<EOS>
There
Madame
Beck
met
,
captured
,
chid
,
convoyed
to
the
street
-
door
,
and
finally
dismissed
him
.
  
<EOS>
As
that
street
-
door
closed
,
a
sudden
amazement
at
my
own
perverse
proceeding
struck
like
a
blow
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
felt
from
the
first
it
was
me
<EOS>
he
wanted
 
me
he
was
seeking
 
and
had
not
I
wanted
him
too
?
<EOS>
What
,
then
,
had
carried
me
away
?
<EOS>
What
had
rapt
me
beyond
his
reach
?
<EOS>
He
had
something
to
tell
:
he
was
going
to
tell
me
that
something
:
my
ear
strained
its
nerve
to
hear
it
,
and
I
had
made
the
confidence
impossible
.
<EOS>
Yearning
to
listen
and
console
,
while
I
thought
audience
and
solace
beyond
<EOS>
hope
's
reach
 
no
sooner
did
opportunity
suddenly
and
fully
arrive
,
than
I
evaded
it
as
I
would
have
evaded
the
levelled
shaft
of
mortality
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
my
insane
inconsistency
had
its
reward
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
the
comfort
,
the
certain
satisfaction
,
I
might
have
won
 
<EOS>
could
I
but
have
put
choking
panic
down
,
and
stood
firm
two
minutes
 
here
<EOS>
was
dead
blank
,
dark
doubt
,
and
drear
suspense
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
my
wages
to
my
pillow
,
and
passed
the
night
counting
them
.
    
<EOS>
MALEVOLA
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
called
me
on
Thursday
afternoon
,
and
asked
whether
I
had
any
occupation
to
hinder
me
from
going
into
town
and
executing
some
little
commissions
for
her
at
the
shops
.
  
<EOS>
Being
disengaged
,
and
placing
myself
at
her
service
,
I
was
presently
furnished
with
a
list
of
the
wools
,
silks
,
embroidering
thread
,
etcetera
,
wanted
in
the
pupils
'
work
,
and
having
equipped
myself
in
a
manner
suiting
the
threatening
aspect
of
a
cloudy
and
sultry
day
,
I
was
just
drawing
the
spring
-
bolt
of
the
street
-
door
,
in
act
to
issue
forth
,
when
Madame
's
voice
again
summoned
me
to
the
salle
-
à
-
manger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
,
Meess
Lucie
!
"
cried
she
,
in
the
seeming
haste
of
an
impromptu
thought
,
"
I
have
just
recollected
one
more
errand
for
you
,
if
your
good
-
nature
will
not
deem
itself
over
-
burdened
?
"
  
<EOS>
Of
course
I
"
confounded
myself
"
in
asseverations
to
the
contrary
;
and
Madame
,
running
into
the
little
salon
,
brought
thence
a
pretty
basket
,
filled
with
fine
hothouse
fruit
,
rosy
,
perfect
,
and
tempting
,
reposing
amongst
the
dark
green
,
wax
-
like
leaves
,
and
pale
yellow
stars
of
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
what
,
exotic
plant
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
she
said
,
"
it
is
not
heavy
,
and
will
not
shame
your
neat
toilette
,
as
if
it
were
a
household
,
servant
-
like
detail
.
<EOS>
Do
me
the
favour
to
leave
this
little
basket
at
the
house
of
Madame
Walravens
,
with
my
felicitations
on
her
fête
.
<EOS>
She
lives
down
in
the
old
town
,
Numéro
3
,
Rue
des
Mages
.
<EOS>
I
fear
you
will
find
the
walk
rather
long
,
but
you
have
the
whole
afternoon
before
you
,
and
do
not
hurry
;
if
you
are
not
back
in
time
for
dinner
,
I
will
order
a
portion
to
be
saved
,
or
Goton
,
with
whom
you
are
a
favourite
,
will
have
pleasure
in
tossing
up
some
trifle
,
for
your
especial
benefit
.
<EOS>
You
shall
not
be
forgotten
,
ma
bonne
Meess
.
<EOS>
And
oh
!
please
!
"
<EOS>
(
calling
me
back
once
more
)
"
be
sure
to
insist
on
seeing
Madame
Walravens
herself
,
and
giving
the
basket
into
her
own
hands
,
in
order
that
there
may
be
no
mistake
,
for
she
is
rather
a
punctilious
personage
.
<EOS>
Adieu
!
<EOS>
Au
revoir
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
at
last
I
got
away
.
<EOS>
The
shop
commissions
took
some
time
to
execute
,
that
choosing
and
matching
of
silks
and
wools
being
always
a
tedious
business
,
but
at
last
I
got
through
my
list
.
<EOS>
The
patterns
for
the
slippers
,
the
bell
-
ropes
,
the
cabas
were
selected
 
the
slides
and
tassels
for
the
purses
chosen
 
the
whole
"
tripotage
,
"
in
short
,
was
off
my
mind
;
nothing
but
the
fruit
and
the
felicitations
remained
to
be
attended
to
.
  
<EOS>
I
rather
liked
the
prospect
of
a
long
walk
,
deep
into
the
old
and
grim
Basse
-
Ville
;
and
I
liked
it
no
worse
because
the
evening
sky
,
over
the
city
,
was
settling
into
a
mass
of
black
-
blue
metal
,
heated
at
the
rim
,
and
inflaming
slowly
to
a
heavy
red
.
  
<EOS>
I
fear
a
high
wind
,
because
storm
demands
that
exertion
of
strength
and
use
of
action
I
always
yield
with
pain
;
but
the
sullen
down
-
fall
,
the
thick
snow
-
descent
,
or
dark
rush
of
rain
,
ask
only
resignation
 
the
quiet
abandonment
of
garments
and
person
to
be
,
drenched
.
<EOS>
In
return
,
it
sweeps
a
great
capital
clean
before
you
;
it
makes
you
a
quiet
path
through
broad
,
grand
streets
;
it
petrifies
a
living
city
as
if
by
eastern
enchantment
;
it
transforms
a
Villette
into
a
Tadmor
.
<EOS>
Let
,
then
,
the
rains
fall
,
and
the
floods
descend
 
only
I
must
first
get
rid
of
this
basket
of
fruit
.
  
<EOS>
An
unknown
clock
from
an
unknown
tower
<EOS>
(
Jean
Baptiste
's
voice
was
now
too
distant
to
be
audible
)
was
tolling
the
third
quarter
past
five
,
when
I
reached
that
street
and
house
whereof
Madame
Beck
had
given
me
the
address
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
street
at
all
;
it
seemed
rather
to
be
part
of
a
square
:
<EOS>
it
was
quiet
,
grass
grew
between
the
broad
grey
flags
,
the
houses
were
large
and
looked
very
old
 
behind
them
rose
the
appearance
of
trees
,
indicating
gardens
at
the
back
.
<EOS>
Antiquity
brooded
above
this
region
,
business
was
banished
thence
.
<EOS>
Rich
men
had
once
possessed
this
quarter
,
and
once
grandeur
had
made
her
seat
here
.
<EOS>
That
church
,
whose
dark
,
half
-
ruinous
turrets
overlooked
the
square
,
was
the
venerable
and
formerly
opulent
shrine
of
the
Magi
.
<EOS>
But
wealth
and
greatness
had
long
since
stretched
their
gilded
pinions
and
fled
hence
,
leaving
these
their
ancient
nests
,
perhaps
to
house
Penury
for
a
time
,
or
perhaps
to
stand
cold
and
empty
,
mouldering
untenanted
in
the
course
of
winters
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
crossed
this
deserted
"
place
,
"
on
whose
pavement
drops
almost
as
large
as
a
five
-
franc
piece
were
now
slowly
darkening
,
I
saw
,
in
its
whole
expanse
,
no
symptom
or
evidence
of
life
,
except
what
was
given
in
the
figure
of
an
infirm
old
priest
,
who
went
past
,
bending
and
propped
on
a
staff
 
the
type
of
eld
and
decay
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
issued
from
the
very
house
to
which
I
was
directed
;
and
when
I
paused
before
the
door
just
closed
after
him
,
and
rang
the
bell
,
he
turned
to
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
soon
avert
his
gaze
;
perhaps
he
thought
me
,
with
my
basket
of
summer
fruit
,
and
my
lack
of
the
dignity
age
confers
,
an
incongruous
figure
in
such
a
scene
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
had
a
young
ruddy
-
faced
bonne
opened
the
door
to
admit
me
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
thought
such
a
one
little
in
harmony
with
her
dwelling
;
but
,
when
I
found
myself
confronted
by
a
very
old
woman
,
wearing
a
very
antique
peasant
costume
,
a
cap
alike
hideous
and
costly
,
with
long
flaps
of
native
lace
,
a
petticoat
and
jacket
of
cloth
,
and
sabots
more
like
little
boats
than
shoes
,
it
seemed
all
right
,
and
soothingly
in
character
.
  
<EOS>
The
expression
of
her
face
was
not
quite
so
soothing
as
the
cut
of
her
costume
;
anything
more
cantankerous
I
have
seldom
seen
;
she
would
scarcely
reply
to
my
inquiry
after
Madame
Walravens
;
I
believe
she
would
have
snatched
the
basket
of
fruit
from
my
hand
,
had
not
the
old
priest
,
hobbling
up
,
checked
her
,
and
himself
lent
an
ear
to
the
message
with
which
I
was
charged
.
  
<EOS>
His
apparent
deafness
rendered
it
a
little
difficult
to
make
him
fully
understand
that
I
must
see
Madame
Walravens
,
and
consign
the
fruit
into
her
own
hands
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
however
,
he
comprehended
the
fact
that
such
were
my
orders
,
and
that
duty
enjoined
their
literal
fulfilment
.
<EOS>
Addressing
the
aged
bonne
,
not
in
French
,
but
in
the
aboriginal
tongue
of
Labassecour
,
he
persuaded
her
,
at
last
,
to
let
me
cross
the
inhospitable
threshold
,
and
himself
escorting
me
up
-
stairs
,
I
was
ushered
into
a
sort
of
salon
,
and
there
left
.
  
<EOS>
The
room
was
large
,
and
had
a
fine
old
ceiling
,
and
almost
church
-
like
windows
of
coloured
-
glass
;
but
it
was
desolate
,
and
in
the
shadow
of
a
coming
storm
,
looked
strangely
lowering
.
<EOS>
Within
 
opened
a
smaller
room
;
there
,
however
,
the
blind
of
the
single
casement
was
closed
;
through
the
deep
gloom
few
details
of
furniture
were
apparent
.
<EOS>
These
few
I
amused
myself
by
puzzling
to
make
out
;
and
,
in
particular
,
I
was
attracted
by
the
outline
of
a
picture
on
the
wall
.
  
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
the
picture
seemed
to
give
way
:
to
my
bewilderment
,
it
shook
,
it
sunk
,
it
rolled
back
into
nothing
;
its
vanishing
left
an
opening
arched
,
leading
into
an
arched
passage
,
with
a
mystic
winding
stair
;
both
passage
and
stair
were
of
cold
stone
,
uncarpeted
and
unpainted
.
<EOS>
Down
this
donjon
stair
descended
a
tap
,
tap
,
like
a
stick
;
soon
there
fell
on
the
steps
a
shadow
,
and
last
of
all
<EOS>
,
I
was
aware
of
a
substance
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
,
was
it
actual
substance
,
this
appearance
approaching
me
?
<EOS>
this
obstruction
,
partially
darkening
the
arch
?
  
<EOS>
It
drew
near
,
and
I
saw
it
well
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
comprehend
where
I
was
.
<EOS>
Well
might
this
old
square
be
named
quarter
of
the
Magi
 
<EOS>
well
might
the
three
towers
,
overlooking
it
,
own
for
godfathers
three
mystic
sages
of
a
dead
and
dark
art
.
<EOS>
Hoar
enchantment
here
prevailed
;
a
spell
had
opened
for
me
elf
-
land
 
<EOS>
that
cell
-
like
room
,
that
vanishing
picture
,
that
arch
and
passage
,
and
stair
of
stone
,
were
all
parts
of
a
fairy
tale
.
<EOS>
Distincter
even
than
these
scenic
details
stood
the
chief
figure
 
Cunegonde
,
the
sorceress
!
<EOS>
Malevola
,
the
evil
fairy
.
<EOS>
How
was
she
?
  
<EOS>
She
might
be
three
feet
high
,
but
she
had
no
shape
;
her
skinny
hands
rested
upon
each
other
,
and
pressed
the
gold
knob
of
a
wand
-
like
ivory
staff
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
large
,
set
,
not
upon
her
shoulders
,
but
before
her
breast
;
she
seemed
to
have
no
neck
;
I
should
have
said
there
were
a
hundred
years
in
her
features
,
and
more
perhaps
in
her
eyes
 
her
malign
,
unfriendly
eyes
,
with
thick
grey
brows
above
,
and
livid
lids
all
round
.
<EOS>
How
severely
they
viewed
me
,
with
a
sort
of
dull
displeasure
!
  
<EOS>
This
being
wore
a
gown
of
brocade
,
dyed
bright
blue
,
full
-
tinted
as
the
gentianella
flower
,
and
covered
with
satin
foliage
in
a
large
pattern
;
over
the
gown
a
costly
shawl
,
gorgeously
bordered
,
and
so
large
for
her
,
that
its
many
-
coloured
fringe
swept
the
floor
.
<EOS>
But
her
chief
points
were
her
jewels
:
she
had
long
,
clear
earrings
,
blazing
with
a
lustre
which
could
not
be
borrowed
or
false
;
she
had
rings
on
her
skeleton
hands
,
with
thick
gold
hoops
,
and
stones
 
purple
,
green
,
and
blood
-
red
.
<EOS>
Hunchbacked
,
dwarfish
,
and
doting
,
she
was
adorned
like
a
barbarian
queen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Que
me
voulez
-
vous
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
hoarsely
,
with
the
voice
rather
of
male
than
of
female
old
age
;
and
,
indeed
,
a
silver
beard
bristled
her
chin
.
  
<EOS>
I
delivered
my
basket
and
my
message
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
<EOS>
she
demanded
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
,
"
said
I.
  
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
it
was
well
worth
while
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Return
to
Madame
Beck
,
and
tell
her
I
can
buy
fruit
when
I
want
it
,
<EOS>
et
quant
<EOS>
à
ses
félicitations
,
je
m'en
moque
!
"
<EOS>
And
this
courteous
dame
turned
her
back
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
she
turned
,
a
peal
of
thunder
broke
,
and
a
flash
of
lightning
blazed
broad
over
salon
and
boudoir
.
<EOS>
The
tale
of
magic
seemed
to
proceed
with
due
accompaniment
of
the
elements
.
<EOS>
The
wanderer
,
decoyed
into
the
enchanted
castle
,
heard
rising
,
outside
,
the
spell
-
wakened
tempest
.
  
<EOS>
What
,
in
all
this
,
was
I
to
think
of
Madame
Beck
?
<EOS>
She
owned
strange
acquaintance
;
she
offered
messages
and
gifts
at
an
unique
shrine
,
and
inauspicious
seemed
the
bearing
of
the
uncouth
thing
she
worshipped
.
<EOS>
There
went
that
sullen
Sidonia
,
tottering
and
trembling
like
palsy
incarnate
,
tapping
her
ivory
staff
on
the
mosaic
parquet
,
and
muttering
venomously
as
she
vanished
.
  
<EOS>
Down
washed
the
rain
<EOS>
,
deep
lowered
the
welkin
;
the
clouds
,
ruddy
a
while
ago
,
had
now
,
through
all
their
blackness
,
turned
deadly
pale
,
as
if
in
terror
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
my
late
boast
about
not
fearing
a
shower
,
I
hardly
liked
to
go
out
under
this
waterspout
.
<EOS>
Then
the
gleams
of
lightning
were
very
fierce
,
the
thunder
crashed
very
near
;
this
storm
had
gathered
immediately
above
Villette
;
it
seemed
to
have
burst
at
the
zenith
;
it
rushed
down
prone
;
the
forked
,
slant
bolts
pierced
athwart
vertical
torrents
;
red
zigzags
interlaced
a
descent
blanched
as
white
metal
:
and
all
broke
from
a
sky
heavily
black
in
its
swollen
abundance
.
  
<EOS>
Leaving
Madame
Walravens
'
inhospitable
salon
<EOS>
,
I
betook
myself
to
her
cold
staircase
;
there
was
a
seat
on
the
landing
 
there
<EOS>
I
waited
.
<EOS>
Somebody
came
gliding
along
the
gallery
just
above
;
it
was
the
old
priest
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
Mademoiselle
shall
not
sit
there
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
displeasure
our
benefactor
if
he
knew
a
stranger
was
so
treated
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
he
begged
me
so
earnestly
to
return
to
the
salon
,
that
,
without
discourtesy
,
I
could
not
but
comply
.
<EOS>
The
smaller
room
was
better
furnished
and
more
habitable
than
the
larger
;
thither
he
introduced
me
.
<EOS>
Partially
withdrawing
the
blind
,
he
disclosed
what
seemed
more
like
an
oratory
than
a
boudoir
,
a
very
solemn
little
chamber
,
looking
as
if
it
were
a
place
rather
dedicated
to
relics
and
remembrance
,
than
designed
for
present
use
and
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
The
good
father
sat
down
,
as
if
to
keep
me
company
;
but
instead
of
conversing
,
he
took
out
a
book
,
fastened
on
the
page
his
eyes
,
and
employed
his
lips
in
whispering
 
what
sounded
like
a
prayer
or
litany
.
<EOS>
A
yellow
electric
light
from
the
sky
gilded
his
bald
head
;
his
figure
remained
in
shade
 
deep
and
purple
;
he
sat
still
as
sculpture
;
he
seemed
to
forget
me
for
his
prayers
;
he
only
looked
up
when
a
fiercer
bolt
,
or
a
harsher
,
closer
rattle
told
of
nearing
danger
;
even
then
,
it
was
not
in
fear
,
but
in
seeming
awe
,
he
raised
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
too
was
awe
-
struck
;
being
,
however
,
under
no
pressure
of
slavish
terror
,
<EOS>
my
thoughts
and
observations
were
free
.
  
<EOS>
To
speak
truth
,
I
was
beginning
to
fancy
that
the
old
priest
resembled
that
Père
Silas
,
before
whom
I
had
kneeled
in
the
church
of
the
Béguinage
.
<EOS>
The
idea
was
vague
,
for
I
had
seen
my
confessor
only
in
dusk
and
in
profile
,
yet
still
I
seemed
to
trace
a
likeness
:
<EOS>
I
thought
also
I
recognized
the
voice
.
<EOS>
While
I
watched
him
,
he
betrayed
,
by
one
lifted
look
,
that
he
felt
my
scrutiny
;
I
turned
to
note
the
room
;
that
too
had
its
half
mystic
interest
.
  
<EOS>
Beside
a
cross
of
curiously
carved
old
ivory
,
yellow
with
time
,
and
sloped
above
a
dark
-
red
_
prie
-
dieu
_
,
furnished
duly
,
with
rich
missal
and
ebon
rosary
 
hung
the
picture
whose
dim
outline
had
drawn
my
eyes
before
 
the
picture
which
moved
,
fell
away
with
the
wall
and
let
in
phantoms
.
<EOS>
Imperfectly
seen
,
I
had
taken
it
for
a
Madonna
;
revealed
by
clearer
light
,
it
proved
to
be
a
woman
's
portrait
in
a
nun
's
dress
.
<EOS>
The
face
,
though
not
beautiful
,
was
pleasing
;
pale
,
young
,
and
shaded
with
the
dejection
of
grief
or
ill
health
.
<EOS>
I
say
again
it
was
not
beautiful
;
it
was
not
even
intellectual
;
its
very
amiability
was
the
amiability
of
a
weak
frame
,
inactive
passions
,
acquiescent
habits
:
yet
I
looked
long
at
that
picture
,
and
could
not
choose
but
look
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
priest
,
who
at
first
had
seemed
to
me
so
deaf
and
infirm
,
must
yet
have
retained
his
faculties
in
tolerable
preservation
;
absorbed
in
his
book
as
he
appeared
,
without
once
lifting
his
head
,
or
,
as
far
as
I
knew
,
turning
his
eyes
,
he
perceived
the
point
towards
which
my
attention
was
drawn
,
and
,
in
a
slow
distinct
voice
,
dropped
,
concerning
it
,
<EOS>
these
four
observations
:
    
<EOS>
"
She
was
much
beloved
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
gave
herself
to
God
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
died
young
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
still
remembered
,
still
wept
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
that
aged
lady
,
Madame
Walravens
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
fancying
that
I
had
discovered
in
the
incurable
grief
of
bereavement
,
a
key
to
that
same
aged
lady
's
desperate
ill
-
humour
.
  
<EOS>
The
father
shook
his
head
with
half
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
he
;
"
a
grand
-
dame
's
affection
for
her
children
's
children
may
be
great
,
and
her
sorrow
for
their
loss
,
lively
;
but
it
is
only
the
affianced
lover
,
to
whom
Fate
,
Faith
,
and
Death
have
trebly
denied
the
bliss
of
union
,
who
mourns
what
he
has
lost
,
as
Justine
Marie
is
still
mourned
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
the
father
rather
wished
to
be
questioned
,
and
therefore
I
inquired
who
had
lost
and
who
still
mourned
"
Justine
Marie
.
<EOS>
"
I
got
,
in
reply
,
quite
a
little
romantic
narrative
,
told
not
unimpressively
,
with
the
accompaniment
of
the
now
subsiding
storm
.
<EOS>
I
am
bound
to
say
it
might
have
been
made
much
more
truly
impressive
,
if
there
had
been
less
French
,
Rousseau
-
like
sentimentalizing
and
wire
-
drawing
;
and
rather
more
healthful
carelessness
of
effect
.
<EOS>
But
the
worthy
father
was
obviously
a
Frenchman
born
and
bred
(
I
became
more
and
more
persuaded
of
his
resemblance
to
my
confessor
)
 
<EOS>
he
was
a
true
son
of
Rome
;
when
he
did
lift
his
eyes
,
he
looked
at
me
out
of
their
corners
,
with
more
and
sharper
subtlety
than
,
one
would
have
thought
,
could
survive
the
wear
and
tear
of
seventy
years
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
I
believe
,
he
was
a
good
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
The
hero
of
his
tale
was
some
former
pupil
of
his
,
whom
he
now
called
his
benefactor
,
and
who
,
it
appears
,
had
loved
this
pale
Justine
Marie
,
the
daughter
of
rich
parents
,
at
a
time
when
his
own
worldly
prospects
were
such
as
to
justify
his
aspiring
to
a
well
-
dowered
hand
.
<EOS>
The
pupil
's
father
 
once
a
rich
banker
 
had
failed
,
died
,
and
left
behind
him
only
debts
and
destitution
.
<EOS>
The
son
was
then
forbidden
to
think
of
Marie
;
especially
that
old
witch
of
a
grand
-
dame
I
had
seen
,
Madame
Walravens
,
opposed
the
match
with
all
the
violence
of
a
temper
which
deformity
made
sometimes
demoniac
.
<EOS>
The
mild
Marie
had
neither
the
treachery
to
be
false
,
nor
the
force
to
be
quite
staunch
to
her
lover
;
she
gave
up
her
first
suitor
,
but
,
refusing
to
accept
a
second
with
a
heavier
purse
,
withdrew
to
a
convent
,
and
there
died
in
her
noviciate
.
  
<EOS>
Lasting
anguish
,
it
seems
,
had
taken
possession
of
the
faithful
heart
which
worshipped
her
,
and
the
truth
of
that
love
and
grief
had
been
shown
in
a
manner
which
touched
even
me
,
as
I
listened
.
  
<EOS>
Some
years
after
Justine
Marie
's
death
,
ruin
had
come
on
her
house
too
:
her
father
,
by
nominal
calling
a
jeweller
,
but
who
also
dealt
a
good
deal
on
the
Bourse
,
had
been
concerned
in
some
financial
transactions
which
entailed
exposure
and
ruinous
fines
.
<EOS>
He
died
of
grief
for
the
loss
,
and
shame
for
the
infamy
.
<EOS>
His
old
hunchbacked
mother
and
his
bereaved
wife
were
left
penniless
,
and
might
have
died
too
of
want
;
but
their
lost
daughter
's
once
-
despised
,
yet
most
true
-
hearted
suitor
,
hearing
of
the
condition
of
these
ladies
,
came
with
singular
devotedness
to
the
rescue
.
<EOS>
He
took
on
their
insolent
pride
the
revenge
of
the
purest
charity
 
housing
,
caring
for
,
befriending
them
,
so
as
no
son
could
have
done
it
more
tenderly
and
efficiently
.
<EOS>
The
mother
 
on
the
whole
a
good
woman
 
died
blessing
him
;
<EOS>
the
strange
,
godless
,
loveless
,
misanthrope
grandmother
lived
still
,
entirely
supported
by
this
self
-
sacrificing
man
.
<EOS>
Her
,
who
had
been
the
bane
of
his
life
,
blighting
his
hope
,
and
awarding
him
,
for
love
and
domestic
happiness
,
long
mourning
and
cheerless
solitude
<EOS>
,
he
treated
with
the
respect
a
good
son
might
offer
a
kind
mother
.
<EOS>
He
had
brought
her
to
this
house
,
"
and
,
"
continued
the
priest
,
while
genuine
tears
rose
to
his
eyes
,
"
here
,
too
<EOS>
,
he
shelters
me
,
his
old
tutor
,
and
Agnes
,
a
superannuated
servant
of
his
father
's
family
.
<EOS>
To
our
sustenance
,
and
to
other
charities
,
I
know
he
devotes
three
-
parts
of
his
income
,
keeping
only
the
fourth
to
provide
himself
with
bread
and
the
most
modest
accommodations
.
<EOS>
By
this
arrangement
he
has
rendered
it
impossible
to
himself
ever
to
marry
:
he
has
given
himself
to
God
and
to
his
angel
-
bride
as
much
as
if
he
were
a
priest
,
like
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
father
had
wiped
away
his
tears
before
he
uttered
these
last
words
,
and
in
pronouncing
them
,
<EOS>
he
for
one
instant
raised
his
eyes
to
mine
.
<EOS>
I
caught
this
glance
,
despite
its
veiled
character
;
the
momentary
gleam
shot
a
meaning
which
struck
me
.
  
<EOS>
These
Romanists
are
strange
beings
.
<EOS>
Such
a
one
among
them
 
whom
you
know
no
more
than
the
last
Inca
of
Peru
,
or
the
first
Emperor
of
China
 
knows
you
and
all
your
concerns
;
and
has
his
reasons
for
saying
to
you
so
and
so
,
when
you
simply
thought
the
communication
sprang
impromptu
from
the
instant
's
impulse
:
his
plan
in
bringing
it
about
that
you
shall
come
on
such
a
day
,
to
such
a
place
,
under
such
and
such
circumstances
,
when
the
whole
arrangement
seems
to
your
crude
apprehension
the
ordinance
of
chance
,
or
the
sequel
of
exigency
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
's
suddenly
-
recollected
message
and
present
,
my
artless
embassy
to
the
Place
of
the
Magi
,
the
old
priest
accidentally
descending
the
steps
and
crossing
the
square
,
his
interposition
on
my
behalf
with
the
bonne
who
would
have
sent
me
away
,
his
reappearance
on
the
staircase
,
my
introduction
to
this
room
,
the
portrait
,
the
narrative
so
affably
volunteered
 
<EOS>
all
these
little
incidents
,
taken
as
they
fell
out
,
seemed
each
independent
of
its
successor
;
a
handful
of
loose
beads
:
but
threaded
through
by
that
quick
-
shot
and
crafty
glance
of
a
Jesuit
-
eye
,
they
dropped
pendent
in
a
long
string
,
like
that
rosary
on
the
prie
-
dieu
.
<EOS>
Where
lay
the
link
of
junction
,
where
the
little
clasp
of
this
monastic
necklace
?
<EOS>
I
saw
or
felt
union
,
but
could
not
yet
find
the
spot
,
or
detect
the
means
of
connection
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
musing
-
fit
into
which
I
had
by
this
time
fallen
,
appeared
somewhat
suspicious
in
its
abstraction
;
he
gently
interrupted
:
"
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
trust
you
have
not
far
to
go
through
these
inundated
streets
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
More
than
half
a
league
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
live
 
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
In
the
Rue
Fossette
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
"
(
with
animation
)
,
"
not
at
the
pensionnat
of
Madame
Beck
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
The
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Donc
"
(
clapping
his
hands
)
,
"
donc
,
vous
devez
connaître
mon
noble
élève
,
mon
Paul
?
"
  
"
Monsieur
Paul
Emanuel
,
Professor
of
Literature
?
"
  
"
He
and
none
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
brief
silence
fell
.
<EOS>
The
spring
of
junction
seemed
suddenly
to
have
become
palpable
;
I
felt
it
yield
to
pressure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
of
M.
Paul
you
have
been
speaking
?
<EOS>
"
I
presently
inquired
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Was
he
your
pupil
and
the
benefactor
of
Madame
Walravens
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
and
of
Agnes
,
the
old
servant
:
and
moreover
,
(
with
a
certain
emphasis
)
,
he
was
and
_
is
_
the
lover
,
true
,
constant
and
eternal
,
of
that
saint
in
heaven
 
Justine
Marie
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
who
,
father
,
are
_
you
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
I
continued
;
and
though
I
accentuated
the
question
,
its
utterance
was
well
nigh
superfluous
<EOS>
;
I
was
ere
this
quite
prepared
for
the
answer
which
actually
came
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
,
daughter
,
am
Père
Silas
;
that
unworthy
son
of
Holy
Church
whom
you
once
honoured
with
a
noble
and
touching
confidence
,
showing
me
the
core
of
a
heart
,
and
the
inner
shrine
of
a
mind
whereof
,
in
solemn
truth
<EOS>
,
I
coveted
the
direction
,
in
behalf
of
the
only
true
faith
.
<EOS>
Nor
have
I
for
a
day
lost
sight
of
you
,
nor
for
an
hour
failed
to
take
in
you
a
rooted
interest
.
<EOS>
Passed
under
the
discipline
of
Rome
,
moulded
by
her
high
training
,
inoculated
with
her
salutary
doctrines
,
inspired
by
the
zeal
she
alone
gives
 
<EOS>
I
realize
what
then
might
be
your
spiritual
rank
,
your
practical
value
;
and
I
envy
Heresy
her
prey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
struck
me
as
a
special
state
of
things
 
<EOS>
I
half
-
realized
myself
in
that
condition
also
;
passed
under
discipline
,
moulded
,
trained
,
inoculated
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
so
,
"
thought
I
,
but
I
restrained
deprecation
,
and
sat
quietly
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
M.
Paul
does
not
live
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
resumed
,
pursuing
a
theme
which
I
thought
more
to
the
purpose
than
any
wild
renegade
dreams
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
;
he
only
comes
occasionally
to
worship
his
beloved
saint
,
to
make
his
confession
to
me
,
and
to
pay
his
respects
to
her
<EOS>
he
calls
his
mother
.
<EOS>
His
own
lodging
consists
but
<EOS>
of
two
rooms
:
he
has
no
servant
,
and
yet
he
will
not
suffer
Madame
Walravens
to
dispose
of
those
splendid
jewels
with
which
you
see
her
adorned
,
and
in
which
she
takes
a
puerile
pride
as
the
ornaments
of
her
youth
,
and
the
last
relics
of
her
son
the
jeweller
's
wealth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
often
,
"
murmured
I
to
myself
,
"
has
this
man
,
this
M.
Emanuel
,
seemed
to
me
to
lack
magnanimity
in
trifles
,
yet
how
great
he
is
in
great
things
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
did
not
reckon
amongst
the
proofs
of
his
greatness
,
<EOS>
either
the
act
of
confession
,
or
the
saint
-
worship
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
is
it
since
that
lady
died
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
looking
at
Justine
Marie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Twenty
years
.
<EOS>
She
was
somewhat
older
than
M.
Emanuel
;
he
was
then
very
young
,
for
he
is
not
much
beyond
forty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
he
yet
weep
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
heart
will
weep
her
always
:
the
essence
of
Emanuel
's
nature
is
 
constancy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
said
with
marked
emphasis
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
the
sun
broke
out
pallid
and
waterish
;
the
rain
yet
fell
,
but
there
was
no
more
tempest
:
that
hot
firmament
had
cloven
and
poured
out
its
lightnings
.
<EOS>
A
longer
delay
would
scarce
leave
daylight
for
my
return
,
so
I
rose
,
thanked
the
father
for
his
hospitality
and
his
tale
,
<EOS>
was
benignantly
answered
by
a
"
pax
vobiscum
,
"
which
I
made
kindly
welcome
,
because
it
seemed
uttered
with
a
true
benevolence
;
but
I
liked
less
the
mystic
phrase
accompanying
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Daughter
,
you
_
shall
_
be
what
you
_
shall
_
be
!
"
<EOS>
an
oracle
that
made
me
shrug
my
shoulders
as
soon
as
I
had
got
outside
the
door
.
<EOS>
Few
of
us
know
what
we
are
to
come
to
certainly
,
but
for
all
that
had
happened
yet
,
I
had
good
hopes
of
living
and
dying
a
sober
-
minded
Protestant
:
there
was
a
hollowness
within
,
and
a
flourish
around
"
Holy
Church
"
which
tempted
me
but
moderately
.
<EOS>
I
went
on
my
way
pondering
many
things
.
<EOS>
Whatever
Romanism
may
be
,
there
are
good
Romanists
:
this
man
,
Emanuel
,
seemed
of
the
best
;
touched
with
superstition
,
influenced
by
priestcraft
,
yet
wondrous
for
fond
faith
,
for
pious
devotion
,
for
sacrifice
of
self
,
for
charity
unbounded
.
<EOS>
It
remained
to
see
how
Rome
,
by
her
agents
,
handled
such
qualities
;
whether
she
cherished
them
for
their
own
sake
and
for
God
's
,
or
put
them
out
to
usury
and
made
booty
of
the
interest
.
  
<EOS>
By
the
time
I
reached
home
,
it
was
sundown
.
<EOS>
Goton
had
kindly
saved
me
a
portion
of
dinner
,
which
indeed
I
needed
.
<EOS>
She
called
me
into
the
little
cabinet
to
partake
of
it
,
and
there
Madame
Beck
soon
made
her
appearance
,
bringing
me
a
glass
of
wine
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
began
she
,
chuckling
,
"
and
what
sort
of
a
reception
did
<EOS>
Madame
Walravens
give
you
?
<EOS>
Elle
est
drôle
,
n'est
-
ce
pas
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
told
her
what
had
passed
,
delivering
verbatim
the
courteous
message
with
which
I
had
been
charged
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
la
singulière
petite
bossue
!
"
laughed
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Et
figurez
-
vous
qu'elle
<EOS>
me
déteste
,
parcequ'elle
me
<EOS>
croit
amoureuse
de
mon
cousin
Paul
;
ce
petit
dévot
qui
<EOS>
n'ose
<EOS>
pas
bouger
,
à
moins
que
son
confesseur
ne
lui
donne
la
permission
!
<EOS>
Au
reste
"
<EOS>
(
she
went
on
)
,
"
if
he
wanted
to
marry
ever
so
much
 
<EOS>
soit
moi
,
soit
<EOS>
une
<EOS>
autre
 
<EOS>
he
could
not
do
it
;
he
has
too
large
a
family
already
on
his
hands
:
<EOS>
Mère
Walravens
,
Père
Silas
,
Dame
Agnes
,
and
a
whole
troop
of
nameless
paupers
.
<EOS>
There
never
was
a
man
like
him
for
laying
on
himself
burdens
greater
than
he
can
bear
,
voluntarily
incurring
needless
responsibilities
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
harbours
a
romantic
idea
about
some
pale
-
faced
Marie
Justine
 
personnage
<EOS>
assez
niaise
à
ce
que
je
pense
"
(
such
was
Madame
's
irreverent
remark
)
,
"
who
has
been
an
angel
in
heaven
,
or
elsewhere
,
this
score
of
years
,
and
to
whom
he
means
to
go
,
free
from
all
earthly
ties
,
pure
comme
un
lis
,
à
ce
qu'il
dit
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
would
laugh
could
you
but
know
half
M.
Emanuel
's
crotchets
and
eccentricities
!
<EOS>
But
I
hinder
you
from
taking
refreshment
,
ma
bonne
Meess
,
which
you
must
need
;
eat
your
supper
,
drink
your
wine

anges

les
bossues
,
et
surtout

les
Professeurs

"
    
<EOS>
FRATERNITY
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oubliez
les
Professeurs
.
"
<EOS>
So
said
Madame
Beck
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
was
a
wise
woman
,
but
she
should
not
have
uttered
those
words
.
<EOS>
To
do
so
was
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
That
night
she
should
have
left
me
calm
 
not
excited
,
indifferent
,
not
interested
,
isolated
in
my
own
estimation
and
that
of
others
 
not
connected
,
even
in
idea
,
with
this
second
person
whom
I
was
to
forget
.
  
<EOS>
Forget
him
?
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
they
took
a
sage
plan
to
make
me
forget
him
 
the
wiseheads
!
<EOS>
They
showed
me
how
good
he
was
;
they
made
of
my
dear
little
man
a
stainless
little
hero
.
<EOS>
And
then
they
had
prated
about
his
manner
of
loving
.
<EOS>
What
means
had
I
,
before
this
day
,
of
being
certain
whether
he
could
love
at
all
or
not
?
  
<EOS>
I
had
known
him
jealous
,
suspicious
;
I
had
seen
about
him
certain
tendernesses
,
fitfulnesses
 
<EOS>
a
softness
which
came
like
a
warm
air
,
and
a
ruth
which
passed
like
early
dew
,
dried
in
the
heat
of
his
irritabilities
:
_
<EOS>
this
_
was
all
I
had
seen
.
<EOS>
And
they
,
Père
Silas
and
Modeste
Maria
Beck
(
that
these
two
wrought
in
concert
<EOS>
I
could
not
doubt
)
opened
up
the
adytum
of
his
heart
 
<EOS>
showed
me
one
grand
love
,
the
child
of
this
southern
nature
's
youth
,
born
so
strong
and
perfect
,
that
it
had
laughed
at
Death
himself
,
despised
his
mean
rape
of
matter
,
clung
to
immortal
spirit
,
and
in
victory
and
faith
,
had
watched
beside
a
tomb
twenty
years
.
  
<EOS>
This
had
been
done
 
not
idly
:
this
was
not
a
mere
hollow
indulgence
of
sentiment
;
he
had
proven
his
fidelity
by
the
consecration
of
his
best
energies
to
an
unselfish
purpose
,
and
attested
it
by
limitless
personal
sacrifices
:
for
those
once
dear
to
her
<EOS>
he
prized
 
<EOS>
he
had
laid
down
vengeance
,
and
taken
up
a
cross
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
as
for
Justine
Marie
,
I
knew
what
she
was
as
well
as
if
I
had
seen
her
.
<EOS>
I
knew
she
was
well
enough
;
there
were
girls
like
her
in
Madame
Beck
's
school
 
phlegmatics
 
pale
,
slow
,
inert
,
but
kind
-
natured
,
neutral
of
evil
,
undistinguished
for
good
.
  
<EOS>
If
she
wore
angels
'
wings
,
I
knew
whose
poet
-
fancy
conferred
them
.
<EOS>
If
her
forehead
shone
luminous
with
the
reflex
of
a
halo
,
I
knew
in
the
fire
of
whose
irids
that
circlet
of
holy
flame
had
generation
.
  
<EOS>
Was
I
,
then
,
to
be
frightened
by
Justine
Marie
?
<EOS>
Was
the
picture
of
a
pale
dead
nun
to
rise
,
an
eternal
barrier
?
<EOS>
And
what
of
the
charities
which
absorbed
his
worldly
goods
?
<EOS>
What
of
his
heart
sworn
to
virginity
?
  
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
 
<EOS>
Père
Silas
 
<EOS>
you
should
not
have
suggested
these
questions
.
<EOS>
They
were
at
once
the
deepest
puzzle
,
the
strongest
obstruction
,
and
the
keenest
stimulus
,
I
had
ever
felt
.
<EOS>
For
a
week
of
nights
and
days
I
fell
asleep
 
<EOS>
I
dreamt
,
and
I
woke
upon
these
two
questions
.
<EOS>
In
the
whole
world
there
was
no
answer
to
them
,
except
where
one
dark
little
man
stood
,
sat
,
walked
,
lectured
,
under
the
head
-
piece
of
a
bandit
bonnet
-
grec
,
and
within
the
girth
of
a
sorry
paletôt
,
much
be
-
inked
,
and
no
little
adust
.
  
<EOS>
After
that
visit
to
the
Rue
des
Mages
,
I
_
did
_
want
to
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
I
felt
as
if
 
knowing
what
I
now
knew
 
his
countenance
would
offer
a
page
more
lucid
,
more
interesting
than
ever
;
I
felt
a
longing
to
trace
in
it
the
imprint
of
that
primitive
devotedness
,
the
signs
of
that
half
-
knightly
,
half
-
saintly
chivalry
which
the
priest
's
narrative
imputed
to
his
nature
.
<EOS>
He
had
become
my
Christian
hero
:
under
that
character
I
wanted
to
view
him
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
was
opportunity
slow
to
favour
;
my
new
impressions
underwent
her
test
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
Yes
:
I
was
granted
an
interview
with
my
"
Christian
hero
"
 
an
interview
not
very
heroic
,
or
sentimental
,
or
biblical
,
but
lively
enough
in
its
way
.
  
<EOS>
About
three
o'clock
of
the
afternoon
,
the
peace
of
the
first
classe
 
safely
established
,
as
it
seemed
,
under
the
serene
sway
of
Madame
Beck
,
who
,
_
in
propriâ
personâ
_
was
giving
one
of
her
orderly
and
useful
lessons
 
<EOS>
this
peace
,
I
say
,
suffered
a
sudden
fracture
by
the
wild
inburst
of
a
paletôt
.
  
<EOS>
Nobody
at
the
moment
was
quieter
than
myself
.
<EOS>
Eased
of
responsibility
by
Madame
Beck
's
presence
,
soothed
by
her
uniform
tones
,
pleased
and
edified
with
her
clear
exposition
of
the
subject
in
hand
<EOS>
(
for
she
taught
well
)
,
I
sat
bent
over
my
desk
,
drawing
 
that
is
,
copying
an
elaborate
line
engraving
,
tediously
working
up
my
copy
to
the
finish
of
the
original
,
for
that
<EOS>
was
my
practical
notion
of
art
;
and
,
strange
to
say
,
I
took
extreme
pleasure
in
the
labour
,
and
could
even
produce
curiously
finical
Chinese
facsimiles
of
steel
or
mezzotint
plates
 
things
about
as
valuable
as
so
many
achievements
in
worsted
-
work
,
but
I
thought
pretty
well
of
them
in
those
days
.
  
<EOS>
What
was
the
matter
?
<EOS>
My
drawing
,
my
pencils
,
my
precious
copy
,
gathered
into
one
crushed
-
up
handful
,
perished
from
before
my
sight
;
I
myself
appeared
to
be
shaken
or
emptied
out
of
my
chair
,
as
a
solitary
and
withered
nutmeg
might
be
emptied
out
of
a
spice
-
box
by
an
excited
cook
.
<EOS>
That
chair
and
my
desk
,
seized
by
the
wild
paletôt
,
one
under
each
sleeve
,
were
borne
afar
;
in
a
second
,
I
followed
the
furniture
;
in
two
minutes
they
and
I
were
fixed
in
the
centre
of
the
grand
salle
 
a
vast
adjoining
room
,
seldom
used
save
for
dancing
and
choral
singing
-
lessons
 
fixed
with
an
emphasis
which
seemed
to
prohibit
the
remotest
hope
of
our
ever
being
permitted
to
stir
thence
again
.
  
<EOS>
Having
partially
collected
my
scared
wits
,
I
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
two
men
,
gentlemen
,
I
suppose
I
should
say
 
one
dark
,
the
other
light
 
one
having
a
stiff
,
half
-
military
air
,
and
wearing
a
braided
surtout
;
the
other
partaking
,
in
garb
and
bearing
,
more
of
the
careless
aspect
of
the
student
or
artist
class
:
both
flourishing
in
full
magnificence
of
moustaches
,
whiskers
,
and
imperial
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
stood
a
little
apart
from
these
;
his
countenance
and
eyes
expressed
strong
choler
;
he
held
forth
his
hand
with
his
tribune
gesture
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
,
"
said
he
,
"
your
business
is
to
prove
to
these
gentlemen
that
I
am
no
liar
.
<EOS>
You
will
answer
,
to
the
best
of
your
ability
,
such
questions
as
they
shall
put
.
<EOS>
You
will
also
write
on
such
theme
as
they
shall
select
.
<EOS>
In
their
eyes
,
it
appears
,
I
hold
the
position
of
an
unprincipled
impostor
.
<EOS>
I
write
essays
;
and
,
with
deliberate
forgery
,
sign
to
them
my
pupils
'
names
,
and
boast
of
them
as
their
work
.
<EOS>
You
will
disprove
this
charge
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grand
ciel
!
<EOS>
Here
was
the
show
-
trial
,
so
long
evaded
,
come
on
me
like
a
thunder
-
clap
.
<EOS>
These
two
fine
,
braided
,
mustachioed
,
sneering
personages
,
were
none
other
than
dandy
professors
of
the
college
 
<EOS>
Messieurs
Boissec
and
Rochemorte
 
a
pair
of
cold
-
blooded
fops
and
pedants
,
sceptics
,
and
scoffers
.
<EOS>
It
seems
that
M.
Paul
had
been
rashly
exhibiting
something
I
had
written
 
something
,
he
had
never
once
praised
,
or
even
mentioned
,
in
my
hearing
,
and
which
I
deemed
forgotten
.
<EOS>
The
essay
was
not
remarkable
at
all
;
it
only
_
seemed
_
remarkable
,
compared
with
the
average
productions
of
foreign
school
-
girls
;
in
an
English
establishment
it
would
have
passed
scarce
noticed
.
<EOS>
Messieurs
Boissec
and
Rochemorte
had
thought
proper
to
question
its
genuineness
,
and
insinuate
a
cheat
;
I
was
now
to
bear
my
testimony
to
the
truth
,
and
to
be
put
to
the
torture
of
their
examination
.
  
<EOS>
A
memorable
scene
ensued
.
  
<EOS>
They
began
with
classics
.
<EOS>
A
dead
blank
.
<EOS>
They
went
on
to
French
history
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
knew
Mérovée
from
Pharamond
.
<EOS>
They
tried
me
in
various
"
ologies
,
and
still
only
got
a
shake
of
the
head
,
and
an
unchanging
"
Je
n'en
sais
rien
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
an
expressive
pause
,
they
proceeded
to
matters
of
general
information
,
broaching
one
or
two
subjects
which
I
knew
pretty
well
,
and
on
which
I
had
often
reflected
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
,
who
had
hitherto
stood
looking
on
,
dark
as
the
winter
-
solstice
,
brightened
up
somewhat
;
he
thought
I
should
now
show
myself
at
least
no
fool
.
  
<EOS>
He
learned
his
error
.
<EOS>
Though
answers
to
the
questions
surged
up
fast
,
my
mind
filling
like
a
rising
<EOS>
well
,
ideas
were
there
,
but
not
words
.
<EOS>
I
either
_
<EOS>
could
_
not
,
or
_
would
_
not
speak
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
which
:
partly
,
I
think
,
my
nerves
had
got
wrong
,
and
partly
my
humour
was
crossed
.
  
<EOS>
I
heard
one
of
my
examiners
 
he
of
the
braided
surtout
 
whisper
to
his
co
-
professor
,
"
Est
-
elle
donc
idiote
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
thought
,
"
an
idiot
she
is
,
and
always
will
be
,
for
such
as
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
I
suffered
 
suffered
cruelly
;
I
saw
the
damps
gather
on
M.
Paul
's
brow
,
and
his
eye
spoke
a
passionate
yet
sad
reproach
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
believe
in
my
total
lack
of
popular
cleverness
;
he
thought
I
_
could
_
be
prompt
if
I
_
would
_
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
to
relieve
him
,
the
professors
,
and
myself
,
I
stammered
out
:
  
"
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
you
had
better
let
me
go
;
you
will
get
no
good
of
me
;
as
you
say
,
I
am
an
idiot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
have
spoken
with
calm
and
dignity
,
or
I
wish
my
sense
had
sufficed
to
make
me
hold
my
tongue
;
that
traitor
tongue
tripped
,
faltered
.
<EOS>
Beholding
the
judges
cast
on
M.
Emanuel
a
hard
look
of
triumph
,
and
hearing
the
distressed
tremor
of
my
own
voice
,
out
I
burst
in
a
fit
of
choking
tears
.
<EOS>
The
emotion
was
far
more
of
anger
than
grief
;
had
I
been
a
man
and
strong
,
I
could
have
challenged
that
pair
on
the
spot
 
<EOS>
but
it
_
was
_
emotion
,
and
I
would
rather
have
been
scourged
than
betrayed
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
incapables
!
<EOS>
Could
they
not
see
at
once
the
crude
hand
of
a
novice
in
that
composition
they
called
a
forgery
?
<EOS>
The
subject
was
classical
.
<EOS>
When
M.
Paul
dictated
the
trait
on
which
the
essay
was
to
turn
,
I
heard
it
for
the
first
time
;
the
matter
was
new
to
me
,
and
I
had
no
material
for
its
treatment
.
<EOS>
But
I
got
books
,
read
up
the
facts
,
laboriously
constructed
a
skeleton
out
of
the
dry
bones
of
the
real
,
and
then
clothed
them
,
and
tried
to
breathe
into
them
life
,
and
in
this
last
aim
I
had
pleasure
.
<EOS>
With
me
it
was
a
difficult
and
anxious
time
till
my
facts
were
found
,
selected
,
and
properly
jointed
;
nor
could
I
rest
from
research
and
effort
till
I
was
satisfied
of
correct
anatomy
;
the
strength
of
my
inward
repugnance
to
the
idea
of
flaw
or
falsity
sometimes
enabled
me
to
shun
egregious
blunders
;
but
the
knowledge
was
not
there
in
my
head
,
ready
and
mellow
;
it
had
not
been
sown
in
Spring
,
grown
in
Summer
,
harvested
in
Autumn
,
and
garnered
through
Winter
;
whatever
I
wanted
I
must
go
out
and
gather
fresh
;
glean
of
wild
herbs
my
lapful
,
and
shred
them
green
into
the
pot
.
<EOS>
Messieurs
Boissec
and
Rochemorte
did
not
perceive
this
.
<EOS>
They
mistook
my
work
for
the
work
of
a
ripe
scholar
.
  
<EOS>
They
would
not
yet
let
me
go
:
I
must
sit
down
and
write
before
them
.
<EOS>
As
I
dipped
my
pen
in
the
ink
with
a
shaking
hand
,
and
surveyed
the
white
paper
with
eyes
half
-
blinded
and
overflowing
,
one
of
my
judges
began
mincingly
to
apologize
for
the
pain
he
caused
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nous
agissons
dans
l'intérêt
de
la
vérité
.
<EOS>
Nous
ne
<EOS>
voulons
pas
vous
blesser
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
Scorn
gave
me
nerve
.
<EOS>
I
only
answered
,
    
"
Dictate
,
Monsieur
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rochemorte
named
this
theme
:
"
Human
Justice
.
"
  
<EOS>
Human
Justice
!
<EOS>
What
was
I
to
make
of
it
?
<EOS>
Blank
,
cold
abstraction
,
unsuggestive
to
me
of
one
inspiring
idea
;
and
there
stood
M.
Emanuel
,
sad
as
Saul
,
and
stern
as
Joab
,
and
there
triumphed
his
accusers
.
  
<EOS>
At
these
two
I
looked
.
<EOS>
I
was
gathering
my
courage
to
tell
them
that
I
would
neither
write
nor
speak
another
word
for
their
satisfaction
,
that
their
theme
did
not
suit
,
nor
their
presence
inspire
me
,
and
that
,
notwithstanding
,
whoever
threw
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
on
M.
Emanuel
's
honour
,
outraged
that
truth
of
which
they
had
announced
themselves
the
 
champions
:
I
_
meant
_
to
utter
all
this
,
I
say
,
when
suddenly
,
a
light
darted
on
memory
.
  
<EOS>
Those
two
faces
looking
out
of
the
forest
of
long
hair
,
moustache
,
and
whisker
 
<EOS>
those
two
cold
yet
bold
,
trustless
yet
presumptuous
visages
 
were
the
same
faces
,
the
very
same
that
,
projected
in
full
gaslight
from
behind
the
pillars
of
a
portico
,
<EOS>
had
half
frightened
me
to
death
on
the
night
of
my
desolate
arrival
in
Villette
.
<EOS>
These
,
I
felt
morally
certain
,
were
the
very
heroes
who
had
driven
a
friendless
foreigner
beyond
her
reckoning
and
her
strength
,
chased
her
breathless
over
a
whole
quarter
of
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pious
mentors
!
<EOS>
"
thought
I.
"
Pure
guides
for
youth
!
<EOS>
If
"
Human
Justice
"
were
what
she
ought
to
be
,
you
two
would
scarce
hold
your
present
post
,
or
enjoy
your
present
credit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
An
idea
once
seized
,
I
fell
to
work
.
"
<EOS>
Human
Justice
"
rushed
before
me
in
novel
guise
,
a
red
,
random
beldame
,
with
arms
akimbo
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
in
her
house
,
the
den
of
confusion
:
servants
called
to
her
for
orders
or
help
which
she
did
not
give
;
beggars
stood
at
her
door
waiting
and
starving
unnoticed
;
a
swarm
of
children
,
sick
and
quarrelsome
,
crawled
round
her
feet
,
and
yelled
in
her
ears
appeals
for
notice
,
sympathy
,
cure
,
redress
.
<EOS>
The
honest
woman
cared
for
none
of
these
things
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
warm
seat
of
her
own
by
the
fire
,
she
had
her
own
solace
in
a
short
black
pipe
,
and
a
bottle
of
Mrs.
Sweeny
's
soothing
syrup
;
she
smoked
and
she
sipped
,
and
she
enjoyed
her
paradise
;
and
whenever
a
cry
of
the
suffering
souls
about
her
"
pierced
her
ears
too
keenly
 
<EOS>
my
jolly
dame
seized
the
poker
or
the
hearth
-
brush
:
if
the
offender
was
weak
,
wronged
,
and
sickly
,
she
effectually
settled
him
:
<EOS>
if
he
was
strong
,
lively
,
and
violent
,
she
only
menaced
,
then
plunged
her
hand
in
her
deep
pouch
,
and
flung
a
liberal
shower
of
sugar
-
plums
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
the
sketch
of
"
Human
Justice
,
"
scratched
hurriedly
on
paper
,
and
placed
at
the
service
of
Messrs.
Boissec
and
Rochemorte
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
read
it
over
my
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Waiting
no
comment
,
I
curtsied
to
the
trio
,
and
withdrew
.
  
<EOS>
After
school
that
day
,
M.
Paul
and
I
again
met
.
<EOS>
Of
course
the
meeting
did
not
at
first
run
smooth
;
there
was
a
crow
to
pluck
with
him
;
that
forced
examination
could
not
be
immediately
digested
.
<EOS>
A
crabbed
dialogue
terminated
in
my
being
called
"
une
petite
moqueuse
et
sans
-
coeur
,
"
and
in
Monsieur
's
temporary
departure
.
  
<EOS>
Not
wishing
him
to
go
quite
away
,
only
desiring
he
should
feel
that
such
a
transport
as
he
had
that
day
given
way
to
,
could
not
be
indulged
with
perfect
impunity
,
I
was
not
sorry
to
see
him
,
soon
after
,
gardening
in
the
berceau
.
<EOS>
He
approached
the
glass
door
;
I
drew
near
also
.
<EOS>
We
spoke
of
some
flowers
growing
round
it
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
Monsieur
laid
down
his
spade
;
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
he
recommenced
conversation
,
passed
to
other
subjects
,
and
at
last
touched
a
point
of
interest
.
  
<EOS>
Conscious
that
his
proceeding
of
that
day
was
specially
open
to
a
charge
of
extravagance
,
M.
Paul
half
apologized
;
he
half
regretted
,
too
,
the
fitfulness
of
his
moods
at
all
times
,
yet
he
hinted
that
some
allowance
ought
to
be
made
for
him
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
can
hardly
expect
it
at
your
hands
,
Miss
Lucy
;
you
know
neither
me
,
nor
my
position
,
nor
my
history
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
history
.
<EOS>
I
took
up
the
word
at
once
;
I
pursued
the
idea
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Monsieur
,
"
I
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
as
you
say
,
I
know
neither
your
history
,
nor
your
position
,
nor
your
sacrifices
,
nor
any
of
your
sorrows
,
or
trials
,
or
affections
,
or
fidelities
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
about
you
;
you
are
for
me
altogether
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hein
?
<EOS>
"
he
murmured
,
arching
his
brows
in
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
Monsieur
,
I
only
see
you
in
classe
 
stern
,
dogmatic
,
hasty
,
imperious
.
<EOS>
I
only
hear
of
you
in
town
as
active
and
wilful
,
quick
to
originate
,
hasty
to
lead
,
but
slow
to
persuade
,
and
hard
to
bend
.
<EOS>
A
man
like
you
,
without
ties
,
can
have
no
attachments
;
without
dependants
,
no
duties
.
<EOS>
All
we
,
with
whom
you
come
in
contact
,
are
machines
,
which
you
thrust
here
and
there
,
inconsiderate
of
their
feelings
.
<EOS>
You
seek
your
recreations
in
public
,
by
the
light
of
the
evening
chandelier
:
this
school
and
yonder
college
are
your
workshops
,
where
you
fabricate
the
ware
called
pupils
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
so
much
as
know
where
you
live
;
it
is
natural
to
take
it
for
<EOS>
granted
that
you
have
no
home
,
and
need
none
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
judged
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
opinion
of
me
is
just
what
I
thought
it
was
.
<EOS>
For
you
I
am
neither
a
man
nor
a
Christian
.
<EOS>
You
see
me
void
of
affection
and
religion
,
unattached
by
friend
or
family
,
unpiloted
by
principle
or
faith
.
<EOS>
It
is
well
,
Mademoiselle
;
such
is
our
reward
in
this
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
philosopher
,
Monsieur
;
a
cynic
philosopher
"
(
<EOS>
and
I
looked
at
his
paletôt
,
<EOS>
of
which
he
straightway
brushed
the
dim
sleeve
with
his
hand
)
,
"
despising
the
foibles
of
humanity
 
above
its
luxuries
 
independent
of
its
comforts
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Et
vous
,
Mademoiselle
?
<EOS>
vous
êtes
proprette
et
douillette
,

et
affreusement
insensible

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
in
short
,
Monsieur
,
now
I
think
of
it
,
you
_
must
_
live
somewhere
?
<EOS>
Do
tell
me
where
;
and
what
establishment
of
servants
do
you
keep
?
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
fearful
projection
of
the
under
-
lip
,
implying
an
impetus
of
scorn
the
most
decided
,
he
broke
out
    
"
Je
vis
dans
un
trou
!
<EOS>
I
inhabit
a
den
,
Miss
 
a
cavern
,
where
you
would
not
put
your
dainty
nose
.
<EOS>
Once
,
with
base
shame
of
speaking
the
whole
truth
,
I
talked
about
my
"
study
"
in
that
college
:
<EOS>
know
now
that
this
"
study
"
is
my
whole
abode
;
my
chamber
is
there
and
my
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
As
for
my
"
establishment
of
servants
'
"
<EOS>
(
mimicking
my
voice
)
"
they
number
ten
;
les
voilà
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
he
grimly
spread
,
close
under
my
eyes
,
his
ten
fingers
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
black
my
boots
,
"
pursued
he
savagely
.
<EOS>
"
I
brush
my
paletôt
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
Monsieur
,
it
is
too
plain
;
you
never
do
that
,
"
was
my
parenthesis
.
  
<EOS>
"
Je
fais
mon
lit
et
mon
ménage
<EOS>
;
I
seek
my
dinner
in
a
restaurant
;
my
supper
takes
care
,
of
itself
;
I
pass
days
laborious
and
loveless
;
nights
long
and
lonely
;
I
am
ferocious
,
and
bearded
and
monkish
;
and
nothing
now
living
in
this
world
loves
me
,
except
some
old
hearts
worn
like
my
own
,
and
some
few
beings
,
impoverished
,
suffering
,
poor
in
purse
and
in
spirit
,
whom
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
own
not
,
but
to
whom
a
will
and
testament
not
to
be
disputed
has
bequeathed
the
kingdom
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Monsieur
;
but
I
know
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
know
?
<EOS>
many
things
,
I
verily
believe
;
yet
not
me
,
Lucy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
you
have
a
pleasant
old
house
in
a
pleasant
old
square
of
the
Basse
-
Ville
 
<EOS>
why
do
n't
you
go
and
live
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hein
?
<EOS>
"
muttered
he
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
liked
it
much
,
Monsieur
;
with
the
steps
ascending
to
the
door
,
the
grey
flags
in
front
,
the
nodding
trees
behind
 
real
trees
,
not
shrubs
 
trees
dark
,
high
,
and
of
old
growth
.
<EOS>
And
the
boudoir
-
oratoire
 
<EOS>
you
should
make
that
room
your
study
;
it
is
so
quiet
and
solemn
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
eyed
me
closely
;
he
half
-
smiled
,
half
-
coloured
.
<EOS>
"
Where
did
you
pick
up
all
that
?
<EOS>
Who
told
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
told
me
.
<EOS>
Did
I
dream
it
,
Monsieur
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
enter
into
your
visions
?
<EOS>
Can
I
guess
a
woman
's
waking
thoughts
,
much
less
her
sleeping
fantasies
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
dreamt
it
,
I
saw
in
my
dream
human
beings
as
well
as
a
house
.
<EOS>
I
saw
a
priest
,
old
,
bent
,
and
grey
,
and
a
domestic
 
old
,
too
,
and
picturesque
;
and
a
lady
,
splendid
but
strange
;
her
head
would
scarce
reach
to
my
elbow
 
<EOS>
her
magnificence
might
ransom
a
duke
.
<EOS>
She
wore
a
gown
bright
as
lapis
-
lazuli
 
<EOS>
a
shawl
worth
a
thousand
francs
<EOS>
:
she
was
decked
with
ornaments
so
brilliant
,
I
never
saw
any
with
such
a
beautiful
sparkle
;
but
her
figure
looked
as
if
it
had
been
broken
in
two
and
bent
double
;
she
seemed
also
to
have
outlived
the
common
years
of
humanity
,
and
to
have
attained
those
which
are
only
labour
and
sorrow
.
<EOS>
She
was
become
morose
 
almost
malevolent
;
yet
_
somebody
_
<EOS>
,
it
appears
,
cared
for
her
in
her
infirmities
 
<EOS>
somebody
forgave
her
trespasses
,
hoping
to
have
his
trespasses
forgiven
.
<EOS>
They
lived
together
,
these
three
people
 
the
mistress
,
the
chaplain
,
the
servant
 
all
old
,
all
feeble
,
all
sheltered
under
one
kind
wing
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
covered
with
his
hand
the
upper
part
of
his
face
,
but
did
not
conceal
his
mouth
,
where
I
saw
hovering
an
expression
I
liked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
have
entered
into
my
secrets
,
"
said
he
,
"
<EOS>
but
how
was
it
done
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
I
told
him
how
 
the
commission
on
which
I
had
been
sent
,
the
storm
which
had
detained
me
,
the
abruptness
of
the
lady
,
the
kindness
of
the
priest
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
I
sat
waiting
for
the
rain
to
cease
,
Père
Silas
whiled
away
the
time
with
a
story
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
story
!
<EOS>
What
story
?
<EOS>
Père
Silas
is
no
romancist
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
tell
Monsieur
the
tale
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
:
begin
at
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
Let
me
hear
some
of
Miss
Lucy
's
French
 
her
best
or
her
worst
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
much
care
<EOS>
which
:
let
us
have
a
good
poignée
of
barbarisms
,
and
a
bounteous
dose
of
the
insular
accent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
is
not
going
to
be
gratified
by
a
tale
of
ambitious
proportions
,
and
the
spectacle
of
the
narrator
sticking
fast
in
the
midst
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
tell
him
the
title
 
the
"
Priest
's
Pupil
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Bah
!
"
said
he
,
the
swarthy
flush
again
dyeing
his
dark
cheek
.
<EOS>
"
The
good
old
father
could
not
have
chosen
a
worse
subject
;
it
is
his
weak
point
.
<EOS>
But
what
of
the
"
Priest
's
Pupil
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
many
things

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
as
well
define
_
<EOS>
what
_
things
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
the
pupil
's
youth
,
the
pupil
's
manhood
;
 
his
avarice
,
his
ingratitude
,
his
implacability
,
his
inconstancy
.
<EOS>
Such
a
bad
pupil
,
Monsieur
!
 
<EOS>
so
thankless
,
cold
-
hearted
,
unchivalrous
,
unforgiving
!
  
<EOS>
"
Et
puis
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
taking
a
cigar
.
  
<EOS>
"
Et
puis
<EOS>
,
"
I
pursued
,
"
he
underwent
calamities
which
one
did
not
pity
 
<EOS>
bore
them
in
a
spirit
one
did
not
admire
 
endured
wrongs
for
which
one
felt
no
sympathy
;
finally
took
the
unchristian
revenge
of
heaping
coals
of
fire
on
his
adversary
's
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
told
me
all
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nearly
all
,
I
think
:
I
have
indicated
the
heads
of
Père
Silas
's
chapters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
forgotten
one
-
that
which
touched
on
the
pupil
's
lack
of
affection
 
on
his
hard
,
cold
,
monkish
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
;
I
remember
now
.
<EOS>
Père
Silas
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
did
_
say
that
his
vocation
was
almost
that
of
a
priest
 
that
his
life
was
considered
consecrated
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
By
what
bonds
or
duties
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
By
the
ties
of
the
past
and
the
charities
of
the
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
,
then
,
the
whole
situation
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
now
told
Monsieur
all
that
was
told
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Some
meditative
minutes
passed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mademoiselle
Lucy
,
look
at
me
,
and
with
that
truth
which
I
believe
you
never
knowingly
violate
,
answer
me
one
question
.
<EOS>
Raise
your
eyes
;
rest
them
on
mine
;
have
no
hesitation
;
fear
not
to
trust
me
 
I
am
a
man
to
be
trusted

"
  
<EOS>
I
raised
my
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Knowing
me
thoroughly
now
 
all
my
antecedents

all
my
responsibilities
 
having
long
known
my
faults

can
you
and
I
still
be
friends

<EOS>

If
Monsieur

a
friend

I
shall
be
glad

have
a
friend
in
him

<EOS>

But
a
close
friend

I
mean
 
intimate

real
 
kindred

blood

Will
Miss

sister

a
very
poor

fettered

burdened

encumbered
man

<EOS>
I
could
not
answer
him
in
words
,
yet
I
suppose
I
_
did
<EOS>
_
answer
him
;
he
took
my
hand
,
which
found
comfort
,
in
the
shelter
of
his
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
His
_
friendship
was
not
a
doubtful
,
wavering
benefit
 
<EOS>
a
cold
,
distant
hope
 
<EOS>
a
sentiment
so
brittle
as
not
to
bear
the
weight
of
a
finger
:
I
at
once
felt
(
or
_
thought

I
felt

<EOS>
its
support

When
I
talk
of
friendship
,
I
mean
_
true
_
friendship
,
"
he
repeated
emphatically
;
and
I
could
hardly
believe
that
words
so
earnest
had
blessed
my
ear
;
I
hardly
could
credit
the
reality
of
that
kind
,
anxious
look
he
gave
.
<EOS>
If
he
_
<EOS>
really
_
wished
for
my
confidence
and
regard
,
and
_
really
_
would
give
me
his
 
why
<EOS>
,
it
seemed
to
me
that
life
could
offer
nothing
more
or
better
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
I
was
become
strong
and
rich
:
in
a
moment
I
was
made
substantially
happy
.
<EOS>
To
ascertain
the
fact
,
to
fix
and
seal
it
<EOS>
,
I
asked
    
"
Is
Monsieur
quite
serious
?
<EOS>
Does
he
really
think
he
needs
me
,
and
can
take
an
interest
in
me
as
a
sister
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
surely
,
"
said
he
;
"
a
lonely
man
like
me
,
who
has
no
sister
,
must
be
but
too
glad
to
find
in
some
woman
's
heart
a
sister
's
pure
affection
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
dare
I
rely
on
Monsieur
's
regard
?
<EOS>
Dare
I
speak
to
him
when
I
am
so
inclined
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
little
sister
must
make
her
own
experiments
,
"
said
he
;
"
I
will
give
no
promises
.
<EOS>
She
must
tease
and
try
her
wayward
brother
till
she
has
drilled
him
into
what
she
wishes
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
he
is
no
inductile
material
in
some
hands
.
"
  
<EOS>
While
he
spoke
,
the
tone
of
his
voice
,
the
light
of
his
now
affectionate
eye
,
gave
me
such
a
pleasure
as
,
certainly
,
I
had
never
felt
.
<EOS>
I
envied
no
girl
her
lover
,
no
bride
her
bridegroom
,
no
wife
her
husband
;
I
was
content
with
this
my
voluntary
,
self
-
offering
friend
.
<EOS>
If
he
would
but
prove
reliable
,
and
he
_
looked
_
reliable
,
what
,
beyond
his
friendship
,
could
I
ever
covet
?
<EOS>
But
,
if
all
melted
like
a
dream
,
as
once
before
had
happened
 
?
  
<EOS>
"
Qu'est
-
ce
donc
?
<EOS>
What
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
as
this
thought
threw
its
weight
on
my
heart
,
its
shadow
on
my
countenance
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
;
and
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
and
a
thoughtful
smile
,
he
showed
me
how
an
equal
fear
 
lest
I
should
weary
of
him
,
<EOS>
a
man
of
moods
so
difficult
and
fitful
 
had
haunted
his
mind
for
more
than
one
day
,
or
one
month
.
  
<EOS>
On
hearing
this
,
a
quiet
courage
cheered
me
.
<EOS>
I
ventured
a
word
of
re
-
assurance
.
<EOS>
That
word
was
not
only
tolerated
;
its
repetition
was
courted
.
<EOS>
I
grew
quite
happy
 
<EOS>
strangely
happy
 
in
making
him
secure
,
content
,
tranquil
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
,
I
could
not
have
believed
that
earth
held
,
or
life
afforded
,
moments
like
the
few
I
was
now
passing
.
<EOS>
Countless
times
it
had
been
my
lot
to
watch
apprehended
sorrow
close
darkly
in
;
but
to
see
unhoped
-
for
happiness
take
form
,
find
place
,
and
grow
more
real
as
the
seconds
sped
,
was
indeed
a
new
experience
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
"
said
M.
Paul
,
speaking
low
,
and
still
holding
my
hand
,
"
did
you
see
a
picture
in
the
boudoir
of
the
old
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
;
a
picture
painted
on
a
panel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
portrait
of
a
nun
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
heard
her
history
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
what
we
saw
that
night
in
the
berceau
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
forget
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
not
connect
the
two
ideas
;
that
would
be
folly
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
of
the
apparition
when
I
saw
the
portrait
,
"
said
I
;
which
was
true
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
not
,
nor
will
you
fancy
,
"
pursued
he
,
"
that
a
saint
in
heaven
perturbs
herself
with
rivalries
of
earth
?
<EOS>
Protestants
are
rarely
superstitious
;
these
morbid
fancies
will
not
beset
_
you
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
know
not
what
to
think
of
this
matter
;
but
I
believe
a
perfectly
natural
solution
of
this
seeming
mystery
will
one
day
be
arrived
at
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Doubtless
,
doubtless
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
no
good
-
living
woman
 
much
less
a
pure
,
happy
spirit
-
would
trouble
amity
like
ours
n'est
-
il
pas
vrai
?
"
  
<EOS>
Ere
I
could
answer
,
Fifine
Beck
burst
in
,
rosy
and
abrupt
,
calling
out
that
I
was
wanted
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
was
going
into
town
to
call
on
some
English
family
,
who
had
applied
for
a
prospectus
:
my
services
were
needed
as
interpreter
.
<EOS>
The
interruption
was
not
unseasonable
:
sufficient
for
the
day
is
always
the
evil
;
for
this
hour
,
its
good
sufficed
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
should
have
liked
to
ask
M.
Paul
whether
the
"
morbid
fancies
,
"
against
which
he
warned
me
,
wrought
in
his
own
brain
.
    
<EOS>
THE
APPLE
OF
DISCORD
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
Fifine
Beck
's
mother
,
another
power
had
a
word
to
say
to
M.
Paul
and
me
,
before
that
covenant
of
friendship
could
be
ratified
.
<EOS>
We
were
under
the
surveillance
of
a
sleepless
eye
:
<EOS>
Rome
watched
jealously
her
son
through
that
mystic
lattice
at
which
I
had
knelt
once
,
and
to
which
M.
Emanuel
drew
nigh
month
by
month
 
<EOS>
the
sliding
panel
of
the
confessional
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
were
you
so
glad
to
be
friends
with
M.
Paul
?
"
asks
the
reader
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Had
he
not
long
been
a
friend
to
you
?
<EOS>
Had
he
not
given
proof
on
proof
of
a
certain
partiality
in
his
feelings
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
had
;
but
still
I
liked
to
hear
him
say
so
earnestly
 
that
he
was
my
close
,
true
friend
;
I
liked
his
modest
doubts
,
his
tender
deference
 
that
trust
which
longed
to
rest
,
and
was
grateful
when
taught
how
.
<EOS>
He
had
called
me
"
sister
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
well
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
he
might
call
me
what
he
pleased
,
so
long
as
he
confided
in
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
willing
to
be
his
sister
,
on
condition
that
he
did
not
invite
me
to
fill
that
relation
to
some
future
wife
of
his
;
and
tacitly
vowed
as
he
was
to
celibacy
,
of
this
dilemma
there
seemed
little
danger
.
  
<EOS>
Through
most
of
the
succeeding
night
I
pondered
that
evening
's
interview
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
much
the
morning
to
break
,
and
then
listened
for
the
bell
to
ring
;
and
,
after
rising
and
dressing
,
I
deemed
prayers
and
breakfast
slow
,
and
all
the
hours
lingering
,
till
that
arrived
at
last
which
brought
me
the
lesson
of
literature
.
<EOS>
My
wish
was
to
get
a
more
thorough
comprehension
of
this
fraternal
alliance
:
to
note
with
how
much
of
the
brother
he
would
demean
himself
when
we
met
again
;
to
prove
how
much
of
the
sister
was
in
my
own
feelings
;
to
discover
whether
I
could
summon
a
sister
's
courage
,
and
he
a
brother
's
frankness
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
.
<EOS>
Life
is
so
constructed
,
that
the
event
does
not
,
can
not
,
will
not
,
match
the
expectation
.
<EOS>
That
whole
day
he
never
accosted
me
.
<EOS>
His
lesson
was
given
rather
more
quietly
than
usual
,
more
mildly
,
and
also
more
gravely
.
<EOS>
He
was
fatherly
to
his
pupils
,
but
he
was
not
brotherly
to
me
.
<EOS>
Ere
he
left
the
classe
,
I
expected
a
smile
,
if
not
a
word
;
I
got
neither
:
<EOS>
to
my
portion
fell
one
nod
 
<EOS>
hurried
,
shy
.
  
<EOS>
This
distance
,
I
argued
,
is
accidental
 
<EOS>
it
is
involuntary
;
patience
,
and
it
will
vanish
.
<EOS>
It
vanished
not
;
it
continued
for
days
;
it
increased
.
<EOS>
I
suppressed
my
surprise
,
and
swallowed
whatever
other
feelings
began
to
surge
.
  
<EOS>
Well
might
I
ask
when
he
offered
fraternity
 
<EOS>
"
Dare
<EOS>
I
rely
on
you
?
<EOS>
"
Well
might
he
,
doubtless
knowing
himself
,
withhold
all
pledge
.
<EOS>
True
,
he
had
bid
me
make
my
own
experiments
 
tease
and
try
him
.
<EOS>
Vain
injunction
!
<EOS>
Privilege
nominal
and
unavailable
!
<EOS>
Some
women
might
use
it
!
<EOS>
Nothing
in
my
powers
or
instinct
placed
me
amongst
this
brave
band
.
<EOS>
Left
alone
,
I
was
passive
;
repulsed
,
I
withdrew
;
forgotten
 
my
lips
would
not
utter
,
nor
my
eyes
dart
a
reminder
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
there
had
been
an
error
somewhere
in
my
calculations
,
and
I
wanted
for
time
to
disclose
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
day
came
when
,
as
usual
,
he
was
to
give
me
a
lesson
.
<EOS>
One
evening
in
seven
he
had
long
generously
bestowed
on
me
,
devoting
it
to
the
examination
of
what
had
been
done
in
various
studies
during
the
past
week
,
and
to
the
preparation
of
work
for
the
week
in
prospect
.
<EOS>
On
these
occasions
my
schoolroom
was
anywhere
,
wherever
the
pupils
and
the
other
teachers
happened
to
be
,
or
in
their
close
vicinage
,
very
often
in
the
large
second
division
,
where
it
was
easy
to
choose
a
quiet
nook
when
the
crowding
day
pupils
were
absent
,
and
the
few
boarders
gathered
in
a
knot
about
the
surveillante
's
estrade
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
customary
evening
,
hearing
the
customary
hour
strike
,
I
collected
my
books
and
papers
,
my
pen
and
ink
,
and
sought
the
large
division
.
  
<EOS>
In
classe
there
was
no
one
,
and
it
lay
all
in
cool
deep
shadow
;
but
through
the
open
double
doors
was
seen
the
carré
,
filled
with
pupils
and
with
light
;
over
hall
and
figures
blushed
the
westering
sun
.
<EOS>
It
blushed
so
ruddily
and
vividly
,
that
the
hues
of
the
walls
and
the
variegated
tints
of
the
dresses
seemed
all
fused
in
one
warm
glow
.
<EOS>
The
girls
were
seated
,
working
or
studying
;
in
the
midst
of
their
circle
stood
M.
Emanuel
,
speaking
good
-
humouredly
to
a
teacher
.
<EOS>
His
dark
paletôt
,
his
jetty
hair
,
were
tinged
with
many
a
reflex
of
crimson
;
his
Spanish
face
,
when
he
turned
it
momentarily
,
answered
the
sun
's
animated
kiss
with
an
animated
smile
.
<EOS>
I
took
my
place
at
a
desk
.
  
<EOS>
The
orange
-
trees
,
and
several
plants
,
full
and
bright
with
bloom
,
basked
also
in
the
sun
's
laughing
bounty
;
they
had
partaken
it
the
whole
day
,
and
now
asked
water
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
had
a
taste
for
gardening
;
he
liked
to
tend
and
foster
plants
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
think
that
working
amongst
shrubs
with
a
spade
or
a
watering
-
pot
soothed
his
nerves
;
it
was
a
recreation
to
which
he
often
had
recourse
;
and
now
he
looked
to
the
orange
-
trees
,
the
geraniums
,
the
gorgeous
cactuses
,
and
revived
them
all
with
the
refreshment
their
drought
needed
.
<EOS>
His
lips
meantime
sustained
his
precious
cigar
,
that
(
for
him
)
first
necessary
and
prime
luxury
of
life
;
its
blue
wreaths
curled
prettily
enough
amongst
the
flowers
,
and
in
the
evening
light
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
no
more
to
the
pupils
,
nor
to
the
mistresses
,
but
gave
many
an
endearing
word
to
a
small
spanieless
(
if
one
may
coin
a
word
)
,
that
nominally
belonged
to
the
house
,
but
virtually
owned
him
as
master
,
being
fonder
of
him
than
any
inmate
.
<EOS>
A
delicate
,
silky
,
loving
,
and
lovable
little
doggie
<EOS>
she
was
,
trotting
at
his
side
,
looking
with
expressive
,
attached
eyes
into
his
face
;
and
whenever
he
dropped
his
bonnet
-
grec
or
his
handkerchief
,
which
he
occasionally
did
in
play
,
crouching
beside
it
with
the
air
of
a
miniature
lion
guarding
a
kingdom
's
flag
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
many
plants
,
and
as
the
amateur
gardener
fetched
all
the
water
from
the
well
in
the
court
,
with
his
own
active
hands
,
his
work
spun
on
to
some
length
.
<EOS>
The
great
school
-
clock
ticked
on
.
<EOS>
Another
hour
struck
.
<EOS>
The
carré
and
the
youthful
group
lost
the
illusion
of
sunset
.
<EOS>
Day
was
drooping
.
<EOS>
My
lesson
,
I
perceived
,
must
to
-
night
be
very
short
;
but
the
orange
-
trees
,
the
cacti
,
the
camelias
were
all
served
now
.
<EOS>
Was
it
my
turn
?
  
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
in
the
garden
were
more
plants
to
be
looked
after
,
 
favourite
rose
-
bushes
,
certain
choice
flowers
;
little
Sylvie
's
glad
bark
and
whine
followed
the
receding
paletôt
down
the
alleys
.
<EOS>
I
put
up
some
of
my
books
;
I
should
not
want
them
all
;
I
sat
and
thought
;
and
waited
,
involuntarily
deprecating
the
creeping
invasion
of
twilight
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvie
,
gaily
frisking
,
emerged
into
view
once
more
,
heralding
the
returning
paletôt
;
the
watering
-
pot
was
deposited
beside
the
well
;
it
had
fulfilled
its
office
;
how
glad
I
was
!
<EOS>
Monsieur
washed
his
hands
in
a
little
stone
bowl
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
longer
time
for
a
lesson
now
;
ere
long
the
prayer
-
bell
must
ring
;
but
still
we
should
meet
;
he
would
speak
;
a
chance
would
be
offered
of
reading
in
his
eyes
the
riddle
of
his
shyness
.
<EOS>
His
ablutions
over
,
he
stood
,
slowly
re
-
arranging
his
cuffs
,
looking
at
the
horn
of
a
young
moon
,
set
pale
in
the
opal
sky
,
and
glimmering
faint
on
the
oriel
of
Jean
Baptiste
.
<EOS>
Sylvie
watched
the
mood
contemplative
;
its
stillness
irked
her
;
she
whined
and
jumped
to
break
it
.
<EOS>
He
looked
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Petite
exigeante
,
"
said
he
;
"
you
must
not
be
forgotten
one
moment
,
it
seems
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
lifted
her
in
his
arms
,
sauntered
across
the
court
,
within
a
yard
of
the
line
of
windows
near
one
of
which
I
sat
:
he
sauntered
lingeringly
,
fondling
the
spaniel
in
his
bosom
,
calling
her
tender
names
in
a
tender
voice
.
<EOS>
On
the
front
-
door
steps
he
turned
;
once
again
he
looked
at
the
moon
,
at
the
grey
cathedral
,
over
the
remoter
spires
and
house
-
roofs
fading
into
a
blue
sea
of
night
-
mist
;
he
tasted
the
sweet
breath
of
dusk
,
and
noted
the
folded
bloom
of
the
garden
;
he
suddenly
looked
round
;
a
keen
beam
out
of
his
eye
rased
the
white
façade
of
the
classes
,
swept
the
long
line
of
croisées
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
bowed
;
if
he
did
,
I
had
no
time
to
return
the
courtesy
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
he
was
gone
;
the
moonlit
threshold
lay
pale
and
shadowless
before
the
closed
front
door
.
  
<EOS>
Gathering
in
my
arms
all
that
was
spread
on
the
desk
before
me
,
I
carried
back
the
unused
heap
to
its
place
in
the
third
classe
.
<EOS>
The
prayer
-
bell
rang
;
I
obeyed
its
summons
.
  
<EOS>
The
morrow
would
not
restore
him
to
the
Rue
Fossette
,
that
day
being
devoted
entirely
to
his
college
.
<EOS>
I
got
through
my
teaching
;
I
got
over
the
intermediate
hours
;
I
saw
evening
approaching
,
and
armed
myself
for
its
heavy
ennuis
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
worse
to
stay
with
my
co
-
inmates
,
or
to
sit
alone
,
I
had
not
considered
;
I
naturally
took
up
the
latter
alternative
;
if
there
was
a
hope
of
comfort
for
any
moment
,
the
heart
or
head
of
no
human
being
in
this
house
could
yield
it
;
only
under
the
lid
of
my
desk
could
it
harbour
,
nestling
between
the
leaves
of
some
book
,
gilding
a
pencil
-
point
,
the
nib
of
a
pen
,
or
tinging
the
black
fluid
in
that
ink
-
glass
.
<EOS>
With
a
heavy
heart
I
opened
my
desk
-
lid
;
with
a
weary
hand
I
turned
up
its
contents
.
  
<EOS>
One
by
one
,
well
-
accustomed
books
,
volumes
sewn
in
familiar
covers
,
were
taken
out
and
put
back
hopeless
:
<EOS>
they
had
no
charm
;
they
could
not
comfort
.
<EOS>
Is
this
something
new
,
this
pamphlet
in
lilac
?
<EOS>
I
had
not
seen
it
before
,
and
I
re
-
arranged
my
desk
this
very
day
 
<EOS>
this
very
afternoon
;
the
tract
must
have
been
introduced
within
the
last
hour
,
while
we
were
at
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
I
opened
it
.
<EOS>
What
was
it
?
<EOS>
What
would
it
say
to
me
?
  
<EOS>
It
was
neither
tale
nor
poem
,
neither
essay
nor
history
;
it
neither
sung
,
nor
related
,
not
discussed
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
theological
work
;
it
preached
and
it
persuaded
.
  
<EOS>
I
lent
to
it
my
ear
very
willingly
,
for
,
small
as
it
was
,
it
possessed
its
own
spell
,
and
bound
my
attention
at
once
.
<EOS>
It
preached
Romanism
;
it
persuaded
to
conversion
.
<EOS>
The
voice
of
that
sly
little
book
was
a
honeyed
voice
;
its
accents
were
all
unction
and
balm
.
<EOS>
Here
roared
no
utterance
of
Rome
's
thunders
,
no
blasting
of
the
breath
of
her
displeasure
.
<EOS>
The
Protestant
was
to
turn
Papist
,
not
so
much
in
fear
of
the
heretic
's
hell
,
as
on
account
of
the
comfort
,
the
indulgence
,
the
tenderness
Holy
Church
offered
:
<EOS>
far
be
it
from
her
to
threaten
or
to
coerce
;
her
wish
was
to
guide
and
win
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
persecute
?
<EOS>
Oh
dear
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
not
on
any
account
!
  
<EOS>
This
meek
volume
was
not
addressed
to
the
hardened
and
worldly
;
it
was
not
even
strong
meat
for
the
strong
:
it
was
milk
for
babes
:
the
mild
effluence
of
a
mother
's
love
towards
her
tenderest
and
her
youngest
;
intended
wholly
and
solely
for
those
whose
head
is
to
be
reached
through
the
heart
.
<EOS>
Its
appeal
was
not
to
intellect
;
it
sought
to
win
the
affectionate
through
their
affections
,
the
sympathizing
through
their
sympathies
:
St.
Vincent
de
Paul
,
gathering
his
orphans
about
him
,
never
spoke
more
sweetly
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
one
capital
inducement
to
apostacy
was
held
out
in
the
fact
that
the
Catholic
who
had
lost
dear
friends
by
death
could
enjoy
the
unspeakable
solace
of
praying
them
out
of
purgatory
.
<EOS>
The
writer
did
not
touch
on
the
firmer
peace
of
those
whose
belief
dispenses
with
purgatory
altogether
:
<EOS>
but
I
thought
of
this
;
and
,
on
the
whole
,
preferred
the
latter
doctrine
as
the
most
consolatory
.
<EOS>
The
little
book
amused
,
and
did
not
painfully
displease
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
canting
,
sentimental
,
shallow
little
book
,
yet
something
about
it
cheered
my
gloom
and
made
me
smile
;
I
was
amused
with
the
gambols
of
this
unlicked
wolf
-
cub
muffled
in
the
fleece
,
and
mimicking
the
bleat
of
a
guileless
lamb
.
<EOS>
Portions
of
it
reminded
me
of
certain
Wesleyan
Methodist
tracts
I
had
once
read
when
a
child
;
they
were
flavoured
with
about
the
same
seasoning
of
excitation
to
fanaticism
.
<EOS>
He
that
had
written
it
was
no
bad
man
,
and
while
perpetually
betraying
the
trained
cunning
 
<EOS>
the
cloven
hoof
of
his
system
 
<EOS>
I
should
pause
before
accusing
himself
of
insincerity
.
<EOS>
His
judgment
,
however
,
wanted
surgical
props
;
it
was
rickety
.
  
<EOS>
I
smiled
then
over
this
dose
of
maternal
tenderness
,
coming
from
the
ruddy
old
lady
of
the
Seven
Hills
;
smiled
,
too
,
at
my
own
disinclination
,
not
to
say
disability
,
to
meet
these
melting
favours
.
<EOS>
Glancing
at
the
title
-
page
,
I
found
the
name
of
"
Père
Silas
.
"
<EOS>
A
fly
-
leaf
bore
in
small
,
but
clear
and
well
-
known
pencil
characters
:
"
From
P.
C.
D.
E.
to
L
 
y.
"
<EOS>
And
when
I
saw
this
I
laughed
:
but
not
in
my
former
spirit
.
<EOS>
I
was
revived
.
  
<EOS>
A
mortal
bewilderment
cleared
suddenly
from
my
head
and
vision
;
the
solution
of
the
Sphinx
-
riddle
was
won
;
the
conjunction
of
those
two
names
,
Père
Silas
and
Paul
Emanuel
,
gave
the
key
to
all
.
<EOS>
The
penitent
had
been
with
his
director
;
permitted
to
withhold
nothing
;
suffered
to
keep
no
corner
of
his
heart
sacred
to
God
and
to
himself
;
the
whole
narrative
of
our
late
interview
had
been
drawn
from
him
;
he
had
avowed
the
covenant
of
fraternity
,
and
spoken
of
his
adopted
sister
.
<EOS>
How
could
such
a
covenant
,
such
adoption
,
be
sanctioned
by
the
Church
?
<EOS>
Fraternal
communion
with
a
heretic
!
<EOS>
I
seemed
to
hear
Père
Silas
annulling
the
unholy
pact
;
warning
his
penitent
of
its
perils
;
entreating
,
enjoining
reserve
,
nay
,
by
the
authority
of
his
office
,
and
in
the
name
,
and
by
the
memory
of
all
M.
Emanuel
held
most
dear
and
sacred
,
commanding
the
enforcement
of
that
new
system
whose
frost
had
pierced
to
the
marrow
of
my
bones
.
  
<EOS>
These
may
not
seem
pleasant
hypotheses
;
yet
,
by
comparison
,
they
were
welcome
.
<EOS>
The
vision
of
a
ghostly
troubler
hovering
in
the
background
,
was
as
nothing
,
matched
with
the
fear
of
spontaneous
change
arising
in
M.
Paul
himself
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
distance
of
time
,
I
can
not
be
sure
how
far
the
above
conjectures
were
self
-
suggested
:
or
in
what
measure
they
owed
their
origin
and
confirmation
to
another
quarter
.
<EOS>
Help
was
not
wanting
.
  
<EOS>
This
evening
there
was
no
bright
sunset
:
<EOS>
west
and
east
were
one
cloud
;
no
summer
night
-
mist
,
blue
,
yet
rose
-
tinged
,
softened
the
distance
;
a
clammy
fog
from
the
marshes
crept
grey
round
Villette
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
the
watering
-
pot
might
rest
in
its
niche
by
the
well
:
a
small
rain
had
been
drizzling
all
the
afternoon
,
and
still
it
fell
fast
and
quietly
.
<EOS>
This
was
no
weather
for
rambling
in
the
wet
alleys
,
under
the
dripping
trees
;
and
I
started
to
hear
Sylvie
's
sudden
bark
in
the
garden
 
her
bark
of
welcome
.
<EOS>
Surely
she
was
not
accompanied
and
yet
this
glad
,
quick
bark
was
never
uttered
,
save
in
homage
to
one
presence
.
  
<EOS>
Through
the
glass
door
and
the
arching
berceau
,
I
commanded
the
deep
vista
of
the
allée
défendue
:
<EOS>
thither
rushed
Sylvie
,
glistening
through
its
gloom
like
a
white
guelder
-
rose
.
<EOS>
She
ran
to
and
fro
,
whining
,
springing
,
harassing
little
birds
amongst
the
bushes
.
<EOS>
I
watched
five
minutes
;
no
fulfilment
followed
the
omen
.
<EOS>
I
returned
to
my
books
;
Sylvie
's
sharp
bark
suddenly
ceased
.
<EOS>
Again
I
looked
up
.
<EOS>
She
was
standing
not
many
yards
distant
,
wagging
her
white
feathery
tail
as
fast
as
the
muscle
would
work
,
and
intently
watching
the
operations
of
a
spade
,
plied
fast
by
an
indefatigable
hand
.
<EOS>
There
was
M.
Emanuel
,
bent
over
the
soil
,
digging
in
the
wet
mould
amongst
the
rain
-
laden
and
streaming
shrubs
,
working
as
hard
as
if
his
day
's
pittance
were
yet
to
earn
by
the
literal
sweat
of
his
brow
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
sign
I
read
a
ruffled
mood
.
<EOS>
He
would
dig
thus
in
frozen
snow
on
the
coldest
winter
day
,
when
urged
inwardly
by
painful
emotion
,
whether
of
nervous
excitation
,
or
,
sad
thoughts
of
self
-
reproach
.
<EOS>
He
would
dig
by
the
hour
,
with
knit
brow
and
set
teeth
,
nor
once
lift
his
head
,
or
open
his
lips
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvie
watched
till
she
was
tired
.
<EOS>
Again
scampering
devious
,
bounding
here
,
rushing
there
,
snuffing
and
sniffing
everywhere
;
she
at
last
discovered
me
in
classe
.
<EOS>
Instantly
she
flew
barking
at
the
panes
,
as
if
to
urge
me
forth
to
share
her
pleasure
or
her
master
's
toil
;
she
had
seen
me
occasionally
walking
in
that
alley
with
M.
Paul
;
and
I
doubt
not
,
considered
it
my
duty
to
join
him
now
,
wet
as
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
She
made
such
a
bustle
that
M.
Paul
at
last
looked
up
,
and
of
course
perceived
why
,
and
at
whom
she
barked
.
<EOS>
He
whistled
to
call
her
off
;
she
only
barked
the
louder
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
quite
bent
upon
having
the
glass
door
opened
.
<EOS>
Tired
,
I
suppose
,
with
her
importunity
,
he
threw
down
his
spade
,
approached
,
and
pushed
the
door
ajar
.
<EOS>
Sylvie
burst
in
all
impetuous
,
sprang
to
my
lap
,
and
with
her
paws
at
my
neck
,
and
her
little
nose
and
tongue
somewhat
overpoweringly
busy
about
my
face
,
mouth
,
and
eyes
,
flourished
her
bushy
tail
over
the
desk
,
and
scattered
books
and
papers
far
and
wide
.
  
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
advanced
to
still
the
clamour
and
repair
the
disarrangement
.
<EOS>
Having
gathered
up
the
books
,
he
captured
Sylvie
,
and
stowed
her
away
under
his
paletôt
,
where
she
nestled
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
,
her
head
just
peeping
forth
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
tiny
,
and
had
the
prettiest
little
innocent
face
,
the
silkiest
long
ears
,
the
finest
dark
eyes
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
her
,
but
I
thought
of
Paulina
de
Bassompierre
:
forgive
the
association
,
reader
,
it
_
would
_
occur
.
  
<EOS>
M.
Paul
petted
and
patted
her
;
the
endearments
she
received
were
not
to
be
wondered
at
;
she
invited
affection
by
her
beauty
and
her
vivacious
life
.
  
<EOS>
While
caressing
the
spaniel
,
his
eye
roved
over
the
papers
and
books
just
replaced
;
it
settled
on
the
religious
tract
.
<EOS>
His
lips
moved
;
he
half
checked
the
impulse
to
speak
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
had
he
promised
never
to
address
me
more
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
his
better
nature
pronounced
the
vow
"
more
honoured
in
the
breach
than
in
the
observance
,
"
for
with
a
second
effort
,
he
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
yet
read
the
brochure
,
I
presume
?
<EOS>
It
is
not
sufficiently
inviting
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
replied
that
I
had
read
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
waited
,
as
if
wishing
me
to
give
an
opinion
upon
it
unasked
.
<EOS>
Unasked
,
however
,
I
was
in
no
mood
to
do
or
say
anything
.
<EOS>
If
any
concessions
were
to
be
made
 
if
any
advances
were
demanded
 
<EOS>
that
was
the
affair
of
the
very
docile
pupil
of
Père
Silas
,
not
mine
.
<EOS>
His
eye
settled
upon
me
gently
:
there
was
mildness
at
the
moment
in
its
blue
ray
 
<EOS>
there
was
solicitude
 
a
shade
of
pathos
;
there
were
meanings
composite
and
contrasted
 
reproach
melting
into
remorse
.
<EOS>
At
the
moment
probably
,
he
would
have
been
glad
to
see
something
emotional
in
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
show
it
.
<EOS>
In
another
minute
,
however
,
I
should
have
betrayed
confusion
,
had
I
not
bethought
myself
to
take
some
quill
-
pens
from
my
desk
,
and
begin
soberly
to
mend
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
knew
that
action
would
give
a
turn
to
his
mood
.
<EOS>
He
never
liked
to
see
me
mend
pens
;
my
knife
was
always
dull
-
edged
 
my
hand
,
too
,
was
unskilful
;
I
hacked
and
chipped
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
I
cut
my
own
finger
 
half
on
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
restore
him
to
his
natural
state
,
to
set
him
at
his
ease
,
to
get
him
to
chide
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maladroit
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
at
last
,
"
she
will
make
mincemeat
of
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
Sylvie
down
,
making
her
lie
quiet
beside
his
bonnet
-
grec
,
and
,
depriving
me
of
the
pens
and
penknife
,
proceeded
to
slice
,
nib
,
and
point
with
the
accuracy
and
celerity
of
a
machine
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
like
the
little
book
?
<EOS>
"
he
now
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
Suppressing
a
yawn
,
I
said
I
hardly
knew
.
  
<EOS>
"
Had
it
moved
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
had
made
me
a
little
sleepy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
After
a
pause
:
)
"
Allons
donc
!
<EOS>
It
was
of
no
use
taking
that
tone
with
him
.
<EOS>
Bad
as
I
was
 
<EOS>
and
he
should
be
sorry
to
have
to
name
all
my
faults
at
a
breath
 
<EOS>
God
and
nature
had
given
me
"
trop
de
sensibilité
et
de
sympathie
"
not
to
be
profoundly
affected
by
an
appeal
so
touching
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
I
responded
,
rousing
myself
quickly
,
"
I
was
not
affected
at
all
 
not
a
whit
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
in
proof
,
I
drew
from
my
pocket
a
perfectly
dry
handkerchief
,
still
clean
and
in
its
folds
.
  
<EOS>
Hereupon
I
was
made
the
object
of
a
string
of
strictures
rather
piquant
than
polite
.
<EOS>
I
listened
with
zest
.
<EOS>
After
those
two
days
of
unnatural
silence
,
it
was
better
than
music
to
hear
M.
Paul
haranguing
again
just
in
his
old
fashion
.
<EOS>
I
listened
,
and
meantime
solaced
myself
and
Sylvie
with
the
contents
of
a
bonbonnière
,
which
M.
Emanuel
's
gifts
kept
well
supplied
with
chocolate
comfits
:
It
pleased
him
to
see
even
a
small
matter
from
his
hand
duly
appreciated
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
and
the
spaniel
while
we
shared
the
spoil
;
he
put
up
his
penknife
.
<EOS>
Touching
my
hand
with
the
bundle
of
new
-
cut
quills
,
he
said
:
 
"
Dites
donc
,
petite
soeur
 
speak
frankly
 
what
have
you
thought
of
me
during
the
last
two
days
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
of
this
question
I
would
take
no
manner
of
notice
;
its
purport
made
my
eyes
fill
.
<EOS>
I
caressed
Sylvie
assiduously
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
,
leaning
 
over
the
desk
,
bent
towards
me
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
called
myself
your
brother
,
"
he
said
:
"
I
hardly
know
what
I
am
 
<EOS>
brother
 
friend
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
think
of
you
 
<EOS>
I
feel
I
wish
,
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
well
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
check
myself
;
you
are
to
be
feared
.
<EOS>
My
best
friends
point
out
danger
,
and
whisper
caution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
right
to
listen
to
your
friends
.
<EOS>
By
all
means
be
cautious
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
your
religion
 
<EOS>
your
strange
,
self
-
reliant
,
invulnerable
creed
,
whose
influence
seems
to
clothe
you
in
,
I
know
not
what
,
unblessed
panoply
.
<EOS>
You
are
good
 
<EOS>
Père
Silas
calls
you
good
,
and
loves
you
 
but
your
terrible
,
proud
,
earnest
Protestantism
,
there
is
the
danger
.
<EOS>
It
expresses
itself
by
your
eye
at
times
;
and
again
,
it
gives
you
certain
tones
and
certain
gestures
that
make
my
flesh
creep
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
demonstrative
,
and
yet
,
just
now
 
when
you
handled
that
tract
 
my
God
!
<EOS>
I
thought
Lucifer
smiled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
do
n't
respect
that
tract
 
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
respect
that
tract
?
<EOS>
But
it
is
the
pure
essence
of
faith
,
love
,
charity
!
<EOS>
I
thought
it
would
touch
you
:
in
its
gentleness
,
I
trusted
that
it
could
not
fail
.
<EOS>
I
laid
it
in
your
desk
with
a
prayer
:
<EOS>
I
must
indeed
be
a
sinner
:
<EOS>
Heaven
will
not
hear
the
petitions
that
come
warmest
from
my
heart
.
<EOS>
You
scorn
my
little
offering
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
cela
me
fait
mal
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
I
do
n't
scorn
it
 
at
least
,
not
as
your
gift
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
,
sit
down
;
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
heathen
,
I
am
not
hard
-
hearted
,
I
am
not
unchristian
,
I
am
not
dangerous
,
as
they
tell
you
;
I
would
not
trouble
your
faith
;
you
believe
in
God
and
Christ
and
the
Bible
,
and
so
do
I.
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
_
do
_
you
believe
in
the
Bible
?
<EOS>
Do
you
receive
Revelation
?
<EOS>
What
limits
are
there
to
the
wild
,
careless
daring
of
your
country
and
sect
.
<EOS>
Père
Silas
dropped
dark
hints
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
By
dint
of
persuasion
,
I
made
him
half
-
define
these
hints
;
they
amounted
to
crafty
Jesuit
-
slanders
.
<EOS>
That
night
M.
Paul
and
I
talked
seriously
and
closely
.
<EOS>
He
pleaded
,
he
argued
.
<EOS>
_
I
_
could
not
argue
 
a
fortunate
incapacity
;
it
needed
but
triumphant
,
logical
opposition
to
effect
all
the
director
wished
to
be
effected
;
but
I
could
talk
in
my
own
way
 
the
way
M.
Paul
was
used
to
 
and
of
which
he
could
follow
the
meanderings
and
fill
the
hiatus
,
and
pardon
the
strange
stammerings
,
strange
to
him
no
longer
.
<EOS>
At
ease
with
him
,
I
could
defend
my
creed
and
faith
in
my
own
fashion
;
in
some
degree
I
could
lull
his
prejudices
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
satisfied
when
he
went
away
,
hardly
was
he
appeased
;
but
he
was
made
thoroughly
to
feel
that
Protestants
were
not
necessarily
the
irreverent
Pagans
his
director
had
insinuated
;
he
was
made
to
comprehend
something
of
their
mode
of
honouring
the
Light
,
the
Life
,
the
Word
;
he
was
enabled
partly
to
perceive
that
,
while
their
veneration
for
things
venerable
was
not
quite
like
that
cultivated
in
his
Church
,
it
had
<EOS>
its
own
,
perhaps
,
deeper
power
 
<EOS>
its
own
more
solemn
awe
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
that
Père
Silas
(
himself
<EOS>
,
I
must
repeat
,
not
a
bad
man
,
though
the
advocate
of
a
bad
cause
)
had
darkly
stigmatized
Protestants
in
general
,
and
myself
by
inference
,
with
strange
names
,
had
ascribed
to
us
strange
"
isms
;
"
Monsieur
Emanuel
revealed
all
this
in
his
frank
fashion
,
which
knew
not
secretiveness
,
looking
at
me
as
he
spoke
with
a
kind
,
earnest
fear
,
almost
trembling
lest
there
should
be
truth
in
the
charges
.
<EOS>
Père
Silas
,
it
seems
,
had
closely
watched
me
,
had
ascertained
that
I
went
by
turns
,
and
indiscriminately
,
to
the
three
Protestant
Chapels
of
Villette
 
<EOS>
the
French
,
German
,
and
English
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
i
d
<EOS>
est
_
,
the
Presbyterian
,
Lutheran
,
Episcopalian
.
<EOS>
Such
liberality
argued
in
the
father
's
eyes
profound
indifference
 
who
tolerates
all
,
he
reasoned
,
can
be
attached
to
none
.
<EOS>
Now
,
it
happened
that
I
had
often
secretly
wondered
at
the
minute
and
unimportant
character
of
the
differences
between
these
three
sects
 
at
the
unity
and
identity
of
their
vital
doctrines
:
I
saw
nothing
to
hinder
them
from
being
one
day
fused
into
one
grand
Holy
Alliance
,
and
I
respected
them
all
,
though
I
thought
that
in
each
there
were
faults
of
form
,
incumbrances
,
and
trivialities
.
<EOS>
Just
what
I
thought
,
that
did
I
tell
M.
Emanuel
,
and
explained
to
him
that
my
own
last
appeal
,
the
guide
to
which
I
looked
,
and
the
teacher
which
I
owned
,
must
always
be
the
Bible
itself
,
rather
than
any
sect
,
of
whatever
name
or
nation
.
  
<EOS>
He
left
me
soothed
,
yet
full
of
solicitude
,
breathing
a
wish
,
as
strong
as
a
prayer
,
that
if
I
were
wrong
,
Heaven
would
lead
me
right
.
<EOS>
I
heard
,
poured
forth
on
the
threshold
,
some
fervid
murmurings
to
"
Marie
,
Reine
du
Ciel
,
"
some
deep
aspiration
that
_
his
_
hope
might
yet
be
_
mine
_
.
  
<EOS>
Strange
!
<EOS>
I
had
no
such
feverish
wish
to
turn
him
from
the
faith
of
his
fathers
.
<EOS>
I
thought
Romanism
wrong
,
a
great
mixed
image
of
gold
and
clay
;
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
_
<EOS>
this
_
Romanist
held
the
purer
elements
of
his
creed
with
an
innocency
of
heart
which
God
must
love
.
  
<EOS>
The
preceding
conversation
passed
between
eight
and
nine
o'clock
of
the
evening
,
in
a
schoolroom
of
the
quiet
Rue
Fossette
,
opening
on
a
sequestered
garden
.
<EOS>
Probably
about
the
same
,
or
a
somewhat
later
hour
of
the
succeeding
evening
,
its
echoes
,
collected
by
holy
obedience
,
were
breathed
verbatim
in
an
attent
ear
,
at
the
panel
of
a
confessional
,
in
the
hoary
church
of
the
Magi
.
<EOS>
It
ensued
that
Père
Silas
paid
a
visit
to
Madame
Beck
,
and
stirred
by
I
know
not
what
mixture
of
motives
,
persuaded
her
to
let
him
undertake
for
a
time
the
Englishwoman
's
spiritual
direction
.
  
<EOS>
Hereupon
I
was
put
through
a
course
of
reading
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
I
just
glanced
at
the
books
lent
me
;
they
were
too
little
in
my
way
to
be
thoroughly
read
,
marked
,
learned
,
or
inwardly
digested
.
<EOS>
And
besides
,
I
had
a
book
up
-
stairs
,
under
my
pillow
,
whereof
certain
chapters
satisfied
my
needs
in
the
article
of
spiritual
lore
,
furnishing
such
precept
and
example
as
,
to
my
heart
's
core
,
I
was
convinced
could
not
be
improved
on
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Père
Silas
showed
me
the
fair
side
of
Rome
,
her
good
works
;
and
bade
<EOS>
me
judge
the
tree
by
its
fruits
.
  
<EOS>
In
answer
,
I
felt
and
I
avowed
that
these
works
were
_
not
_
the
fruits
of
Rome
;
they
were
but
her
abundant
blossoming
,
but
the
fair
promise
she
showed
the
world
,
That
bloom
,
when
set
,
savoured
not
of
charity
;
the
apple
full
formed
was
ignorance
,
abasement
,
and
bigotry
.
<EOS>
Out
of
men
's
afflictions
and
affections
were
forged
the
rivets
of
their
servitude
.
<EOS>
Poverty
was
fed
and
clothed
,
and
sheltered
,
to
bind
it
by
obligation
to
"
the
Church
;
"
orphanage
was
reared
and
educated
that
it
might
grow
up
in
the
fold
of
"
the
Church
;
"
sickness
was
tended
that
it
might
die
after
the
formula
and
in
the
ordinance
of
"
the
Church
;
"
and
men
were
overwrought
,
and
women
most
murderously
sacrificed
,
and
all
laid
down
a
world
God
made
pleasant
for
his
creatures
'
good
,
and
took
up
a
cross
,
monstrous
in
its
galling
weight
,
that
they
might
serve
Rome
,
prove
her
sanctity
,
confirm
her
power
,
and
spread
the
reign
of
her
tyrant
"
Church
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
man
's
good
was
little
done
;
for
God
's
glory
,
less
.
<EOS>
A
thousand
ways
were
opened
with
pain
,
with
blood
-
sweats
,
with
lavishing
of
life
;
mountains
were
cloven
through
their
breasts
,
and
rocks
were
split
to
their
base
;
and
all
for
what
?
<EOS>
That
a
Priesthood
might
march
straight
on
and
straight
upward
to
an
all
-
dominating
eminence
,
whence
they
might
at
last
stretch
the
sceptre
of
their
Moloch
"
Church
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
.
<EOS>
God
is
not
with
Rome
,
and
,
were
human
sorrows
still
for
the
Son
of
God
,
would
he
not
mourn
over
her
cruelties
and
ambitions
,
as
once
he
mourned
over
the
crimes
and
woes
of
doomed
Jerusalem
!
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
lovers
of
power
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
mitred
aspirants
for
this
world
's
kingdoms
!
<EOS>
an
hour
will
come
,
even
to
you
,
when
it
will
be
well
for
your
hearts
 
pausing
faint
at
each
broken
beat
 
that
there
is
a
Mercy
beyond
human
compassions
,
a
Love
,
stronger
than
this
strong
death
which
even
you
must
face
,
and
before
it
,
fall
;
a
Charity
more
potent
than
any
sin
,
even
yours
;
a
Pity
which
redeems
worlds
 
<EOS>
nay
,
absolves
Priests
.
     
<EOS>
My
third
temptation
was
held
out
in
the
pomp
of
Rome
 
the
glory
of
her
kingdom
.
<EOS>
I
was
taken
to
the
churches
on
solemn
occasions
 
days
of
fête
and
state
;
I
was
shown
the
Papal
ritual
and
ceremonial
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
Many
people
 
men
and
women
 
no
doubt
far
<EOS>
my
superiors
in
a
thousand
ways
,
have
felt
this
display
impressive
,
have
declared
that
though
their
Reason
protested
,
their
Imagination
was
subjugated
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
the
same
.
<EOS>
Neither
full
procession
,
nor
high
mass
,
nor
swarming
tapers
,
nor
swinging
censers
,
nor
ecclesiastical
millinery
,
nor
celestial
jewellery
,
touched
my
imagination
a
whit
.
<EOS>
What
I
saw
struck
me
as
tawdry
,
not
grand
;
as
grossly
material
,
not
poetically
spiritual
.
  
<EOS>
This
I
did
not
tell
Père
Silas
;
he
was
old
,
he
looked
venerable
:
through
every
abortive
experiment
,
under
every
repeated
disappointment
,
he
remained
personally
kind
to
me
,
and
I
felt
tender
of
hurting
his
feelings
.
<EOS>
But
on
the
evening
of
a
certain
day
when
,
from
the
balcony
of
a
great
house
,
I
had
been
made
to
witness
a
huge
mingled
procession
of
the
church
and
the
army
 
priests
with
relics
,
and
soldiers
with
weapons
,
an
obese
and
aged
archbishop
,
habited
in
cambric
and
lace
,
looking
strangely
like
a
grey
daw
in
bird
-
of
-
paradise
plumage
,
and
a
band
of
young
girls
fantastically
robed
and
garlanded
 
_
<EOS>
then
_
I
spoke
my
mind
to
M.
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
like
it
,
"
I
told
him
;
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
respect
such
ceremonies
;
I
wished
to
see
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
having
relieved
my
conscience
by
this
declaration
,
I
was
able
to
go
on
,
and
,
speaking
more
currently
and
clearly
than
my
wo
nt
,
to
show
him
that
I
had
a
mind
to
keep
to
my
reformed
creed
;
the
more
I
saw
of
Popery
the
closer
I
clung
to
Protestantism
;
doubtless
there
were
errors
in
every
church
,
but
I
now
perceived
by
contrast
<EOS>
how
severely
pure
was
my
own
,
compared
with
her
whose
painted
and
meretricious
face
had
been
unveiled
for
my
admiration
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
how
we
kept
fewer
forms
between
us
and
God
;
retaining
,
indeed
,
no
more
than
,
perhaps
,
the
nature
of
mankind
in
the
mass
rendered
necessary
for
due
observance
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
could
not
look
on
flowers
and
tinsel
,
on
wax
-
lights
and
embroidery
,
at
such
times
and
under
such
circumstances
as
should
be
devoted
to
lifting
the
secret
vision
to
Him
whose
home
is
Infinity
,
and
<EOS>
His
being
 
Eternity
.
<EOS>
That
when
I
thought
of
sin
and
sorrow
,
of
earthly
corruption
,
mortal
depravity
,
weighty
temporal
woe
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
care
for
chanting
priests
or
mumming
officials
;
that
when
the
pains
of
existence
and
the
terrors
of
dissolution
pressed
before
me
 
when
the
mighty
hope
and
measureless
doubt
of
the
future
arose
in
view
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
then
_
,
even
the
scientific
strain
,
or
the
prayer
in
a
language
learned
and
dead
<EOS>
,
harassed
:
with
hindrance
a
heart
which
only
longed
to
cry
 
<EOS>
"
God
be
merciful
to
me
,
a
sinner
!
"
  
<EOS>
When
I
had
so
spoken
,
so
declared
my
faith
,
and
so
widely
severed
myself
,
<EOS>
from
him
I
addressed
 
then
,
at
last
,
came
a
tone
<EOS>
accordant
,
an
echo
responsive
,
one
sweet
chord
of
harmony
in
two
conflicting
spirits
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whatever
say
priests
or
controversialists
,
"
murmured
M.
Emanuel
,
"
<EOS>
God
is
good
,
and
loves
all
the
sincere
.
<EOS>
Believe
,
then
,
what
you
can
;
believe
it
as
you
can
;
one
prayer
,
at
least
,
we
have
in
common
;
I
also
cry
 
"
O
Dieu
,
sois
appaisé
envers
moi
qui
suis
pécheur
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
He
leaned
on
the
back
of
my
chair
.
<EOS>
After
some
thought
he
again
spoke
:
  
"
How
seem
in
the
eyes
of
that
God
who
made
all
firmaments
,
from
whose
nostrils
issued
whatever
of
life
is
here
,
or
in
the
stars
shining
yonder
 
<EOS>
how
seem
the
differences
of
man
?
<EOS>
But
as
Time
is
not
for
God
,
nor
Space
,
so
neither
is
Measure
,
nor
Comparison
.
<EOS>
We
abase
ourselves
in
our
littleness
,
and
we
do
right
;
yet
it
may
be
that
the
constancy
of
one
heart
,
the
truth
and
faith
of
one
mind
according
to
the
light
He
has
appointed
,
import
as
much
to
Him
as
the
just
motion
of
satellites
about
their
planets
,
of
planets
about
their
suns
,
of
suns
around
that
mighty
unseen
centre
incomprehensible
,
irrealizable
,
with
strange
mental
effort
only
divined
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
guide
us
all
!
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
Lucy
!

<EOS>
It
was
very
,
well
for
Paulina
to
decline
further
correspondence
with
Graham
till
her
father
had
sanctioned
the
intercourse
.
<EOS>
But
Dr.
Bretton
could
not
live
within
a
league
of
the
Hôtel
Crécy
,
and
not
contrive
to
visit
there
often
.
<EOS>
Both
lovers
meant
at
first
,
I
believe
,
to
be
distant
;
they
kept
their
intention
so
far
as
demonstrative
courtship
went
,
but
in
feeling
they
soon
drew
very
near
.
  
<EOS>
All
that
was
best
in
Graham
sought
Paulina
;
whatever
in
him
was
noble
,
awoke
,
and
grew
in
her
presence
.
<EOS>
With
his
past
admiration
of
Miss
Fanshawe
,
I
suppose
his
intellect
had
little
to
do
,
but
his
whole
intellect
,
and
his
highest
tastes
,
came
in
question
now
.
<EOS>
These
,
like
all
his
faculties
,
were
active
,
eager
for
nutriment
,
and
alive
to
gratification
when
it
came
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
Paulina
designedly
led
him
to
talk
of
books
,
or
formally
proposed
to
herself
for
a
moment
the
task
of
winning
him
to
reflection
,
or
planned
the
improvement
of
his
mind
,
or
so
much
as
fancied
his
mind
<EOS>
could
in
any
one
respect
be
improved
.
<EOS>
She
thought
him
very
perfect
;
it
was
Graham
himself
,
who
,
at
first
by
the
merest
chance
,
mentioned
some
book
he
had
been
reading
,
and
when
in
her
response
sounded
a
welcome
harmony
of
sympathies
,
something
,
pleasant
to
his
soul
,
he
talked
on
,
more
and
better
perhaps
than
he
had
ever
talked
before
on
such
subjects
.
<EOS>
She
listened
with
delight
,
and
answered
with
animation
.
<EOS>
In
each
successive
answer
,
Graham
heard
a
music
waxing
finer
and
finer
to
his
sense
;
in
each
he
found
a
suggestive
,
persuasive
,
magic
accent
that
opened
a
scarce
-
known
treasure
-
house
within
,
showed
him
unsuspected
power
in
his
own
mind
,
and
what
was
better
,
latent
goodness
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
Each
liked
the
way
in
which
the
other
talked
;
the
voice
,
the
diction
,
the
expression
pleased
;
each
keenly
relished
the
flavour
of
the
other
's
wit
;
they
met
each
other
's
meaning
with
strange
quickness
,
their
thoughts
often
matched
like
carefully
-
chosen
pearls
.
<EOS>
Graham
had
wealth
of
mirth
by
nature
;
Paulina
possessed
no
such
inherent
flow
of
animal
spirits
 
unstimulated
,
she
inclined
to
be
thoughtful
and
pensive
 
<EOS>
but
now
she
seemed
merry
as
a
lark
;
in
her
lover
's
genial
presence
,
she
glanced
like
some
soft
glad
light
.
<EOS>
How
beautiful
she
grew
in
her
happiness
,
I
can
hardly
express
,
but
I
wondered
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
As
to
that
gentle
ice
of
hers
 
that
reserve
on
which
she
had
depended
;
where
was
it
now
?
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Graham
would
not
long
bear
it
;
he
brought
with
him
a
generous
influence
that
soon
thawed
the
timid
,
self
-
imposed
restriction
.
  
<EOS>
Now
were
the
old
Bretton
days
talked
over
;
perhaps
brokenly
at
first
,
with
a
sort
of
smiling
diffidence
,
then
with
opening
candour
and
still
growing
confidence
.
<EOS>
Graham
had
made
for
himself
a
better
opportunity
than
that
he
had
wished
me
to
give
;
he
had
earned
independence
of
the
collateral
help
that
disobliging
Lucy
had
refused
;
all
his
reminiscences
of
"
little
Polly
"
found
their
proper
expression
in
his
own
pleasant
tones
,
by
his
own
kind
and
handsome
lips
;
how
much
better
than
if
suggested
by
me
.
  
<EOS>
More
than
once
when
we
were
alone
,
Paulina
would
tell
me
how
wonderful
and
curious
it
was
to
discover
the
richness
and
accuracy
of
his
memory
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
How
,
while
he
was
looking
at
her
,
recollections
would
seem
to
be
suddenly
quickened
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
reminded
her
that
she
had
once
gathered
his
head
in
her
arms
,
caressed
his
leonine
graces
,
and
cried
out
,
"
Graham
,
I
_
do
_
like
you
!
"
<EOS>
He
told
her
how
she
would
set
a
footstool
beside
him
,
and
climb
by
its
aid
to
his
knee
.
<EOS>
At
this
day
he
said
he
could
recall
the
sensation
of
her
little
hands
smoothing
his
cheek
,
or
burying
themselves
in
his
thick
mane
.
<EOS>
He
remembered
the
touch
of
her
small
forefinger
,
placed
half
tremblingly
,
half
curiously
,
in
the
cleft
in
his
chin
,
the
lisp
,
the
look
with
which
she
would
name
it
"
a
pretty
dimple
,
"
then
seek
his
eyes
and
question
why
they
pierced
so
,
telling
him
he
had
a
"
nice
,
strange
face
;
far
nicer
,
far
stranger
,
than
either
his
mamma
or
Lucy
Snowe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Child
as
I
was
,
"
remarked
Paulina
,
"
I
wonder
how
I
dared
be
so
venturous
.
<EOS>
To
me
he
seems
now
all
sacred
,
his
locks
are
inaccessible
,
and
,
Lucy
,
I
feel
a
sort
of
fear
,
when
I
look
at
his
firm
,
marble
chin
,
at
his
straight
Greek
features
.
<EOS>
Women
are
called
beautiful
,
Lucy
;
he
is
not
like
a
woman
,
therefore
I
suppose
he
is
not
beautiful
,
but
what
is
he
,
then
?
<EOS>
Do
other
people
see
him
with
my
eyes
?
<EOS>
Do
_
<EOS>
you
_
admire
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
do
,
Paulina
,
"
was
once
my
answer
to
her
many
questions
.
"
<EOS>
_
I
never
see
him
_
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
him
twice
or
thrice
about
a
year
ago
,
before
he
recognised
me
,
and
then
I
shut
my
eyes
;
and
if
he
were
to
cross
their
balls
twelve
times
between
each
day
's
sunset
and
sunrise
,
except
from
memory
,
I
should
hardly
know
what
shape
had
gone
by
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
what
do
you
mean
?
"
said
she
,
under
her
breath
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
I
value
vision
,
and
dread
being
struck
stone
blind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
best
to
answer
her
strongly
at
once
,
and
to
silence
for
ever
the
tender
,
passionate
confidences
which
left
her
lips
sweet
honey
,
and
sometimes
dropped
in
my
ear
 
molten
lead
.
<EOS>
To
me
,
she
commented
no
more
on
her
lover
's
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
speak
of
him
<EOS>
she
would
;
sometimes
shyly
,
in
quiet
,
brief
phrases
;
sometimes
with
a
tenderness
of
cadence
,
and
music
of
voice
exquisite
in
itself
;
but
which
chafed
me
at
times
miserably
;
and
then
,
I
know
,
I
gave
her
stern
looks
and
words
;
but
cloudless
happiness
had
dazzled
her
native
clear
sight
,
and
she
only
thought
Lucy
 
fitful
.
  
<EOS>
"
Spartan
girl
!
<EOS>
Proud
Lucy
!
<EOS>
"
she
would
say
,
smiling
at
me
.
"
<EOS>
Graham
says
you
are
the
most
peculiar
,
capricious
little
woman
he
knows
;
but
yet
you
are
excellent
;
we
both
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
both
think
you
know
not
what
,
"
said
I.
"
<EOS>
Have
the
goodness
to
make
me
as
little
the
subject
of
your
mutual
talk
and
thoughts
as
possible
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
sort
of
life
apart
from
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
ours
,
Lucy
,
is
a
beautiful
life
,
or
it
will
be
;
and
you
shall
share
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
share
no
man
's
or
woman
's
life
in
this
world
,
as
you
understand
sharing
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
one
friend
of
my
own
,
but
am
not
sure
;
and
till
I
_
am
_
<EOS>
sure
,
I
live
solitary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
solitude
is
sadness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
it
is
sadness
.
<EOS>
Life
,
however
;
has
worse
than
that
.
<EOS>
Deeper
than
melancholy
,
lies
heart
-
break
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
I
wonder
if
anybody
will
ever
comprehend
you
altogether
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
is
,
in
lovers
,
a
certain
infatuation
of
egotism
;
they
will
have
a
witness
of
their
happiness
,
cost
that
witness
what
it
may
.
<EOS>
Paulina
had
forbidden
letters
,
yet
Dr.
Bretton
wrote
;
she
had
resolved
against
correspondence
,
yet
<EOS>
she
answered
,
were
it
only
to
chide
.
<EOS>
She
showed
me
these
letters
;
with
something
of
the
spoiled
child
's
wilfulness
,
and
of
the
heiress
's
imperiousness
,
she
_
made
_
me
read
them
.
<EOS>
As
I
read
Graham
's
,
I
scarce
wondered
at
her
exaction
,
and
understood
her
pride
:
they
were
fine
letters
 
manly
and
fond
 
modest
and
gallant
.
<EOS>
Hers
must
have
appeared
to
him
beautiful
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
been
written
to
show
her
talents
;
still
less
,
I
think
,
to
express
her
love
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
it
appeared
that
she
had
proposed
to
herself
the
task
of
hiding
that
feeling
,
and
bridling
her
lover
's
ardour
.
<EOS>
But
how
could
such
letters
serve
such
a
purpose
?
<EOS>
Graham
was
become
dear
as
her
life
;
he
drew
her
like
a
powerful
magnet
.
<EOS>
For
her
there
was
influence
unspeakable
in
all
he
uttered
,
wrote
,
thought
,
or
looked
.
<EOS>
With
this
unconfessed
confession
,
her
letters
glowed
;
it
kindled
them
,
from
greeting
to
adieu
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
papa
knew
;
I
_
do
_
wish
papa
knew
!
<EOS>
"
began
now
to
be
her
anxious
murmur
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
and
yet
I
fear
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
keep
Graham
back
from
telling
him
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
I
long
for
more
than
to
have
this
affair
settled
 
to
speak
out
candidly
;
and
yet
I
dread
the
crisis
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
I
am
certain
,
papa
will
be
angry
at
the
first
;
I
fear
he
will
dislike
me
almost
;
it
will
seem
to
him
an
untoward
business
;
it
will
be
a
surprise
,
a
shock
:
I
can
hardly
foresee
its
whole
effect
on
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
fact
was
 
her
father
,
long
calm
,
was
beginning
to
be
a
little
stirred
:
long
blind
on
one
point
,
an
importunate
light
was
beginning
to
trespass
on
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
To
_
her
_
,
he
said
nothing
;
but
when
she
was
not
looking
at
,
or
perhaps
thinking
of
him
,
I
saw
him
gaze
and
meditate
on
her
.
  
<EOS>
One
evening
 
Paulina
was
in
her
dressing
-
room
,
writing
,
I
believe
,
to
Graham
;
she
had
left
me
in
the
library
,
reading
 
M.
de
Bassompierre
came
in
;
he
sat
down
:
<EOS>
I
was
about
to
withdraw
;
he
requested
me
to
remain
 
gently
,
yet
in
a
manner
which
showed
he
wished
compliance
.
<EOS>
He
had
taken
his
seat
near
the
window
,
at
a
distance
from
me
;
he
opened
a
desk
;
he
took
from
it
what
looked
like
a
memorandum
-
book
;
of
this
book
he
studied
a
certain
entry
for
several
minutes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Snowe
,
"
said
he
,
laying
it
down
,
"
do
you
know
my
little
girl
's
age
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
About
eighteen
,
is
it
not
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
so
.
<EOS>
This
old
pocket
-
book
tells
me
she
was
born
on
the
5th
of
May
,
in
the
year
18
 
,
eighteen
years
ago
.
<EOS>
It
is
strange
;
I
had
lost
the
just
reckoning
of
her
age
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
her
as
twelve
 
fourteen
 
an
indefinite
date
;
but
she
seemed
a
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
about
eighteen
,
"
I
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
grown
up
;
she
will
be
no
taller
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
little
jewel
!
"
said
M.
de
Bassompierre
,
in
a
tone
which
penetrated
like
some
of
his
daughter
's
accents
.
  
<EOS>
He
sat
very
thoughtful
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
do
n't
grieve
,
"
I
said
;
for
I
knew
his
feelings
,
utterly
unspoken
as
they
were
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
the
only
pearl
I
have
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
now
others
will
find
out
that
she
is
pure
and
of
price
:
they
will
covet
her
.

<EOS>
I
made
no
answer
.
<EOS>
Graham
Bretton
had
dined
with
us
that
day
;
he
had
shone
both
in
converse
and
looks
:
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
pride
of
bloom
embellished
his
aspect
and
mellowed
his
intercourse
.
<EOS>
Under
the
stimulus
of
a
high
hope
,
something
had
unfolded
in
his
whole
manner
which
compelled
attention
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
had
purposed
on
that
day
to
indicate
the
origin
of
his
endeavours
,
and
the
aim
of
his
ambition
.
<EOS>
M.
de
Bassompierre
had
found
himself
forced
,
in
a
manner
,
to
descry
the
direction
and
catch
the
character
of
his
homage
.
<EOS>
Slow
in
remarking
,
he
was
logical
in
reasoning
:
having
once
seized
the
thread
,
it
had
guided
him
through
a
long
labyrinth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
she
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
she
doing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
writing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
writes
,
does
she
?
<EOS>
Does
she
receive
letters
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
but
such
as
she
can
show
me
.
<EOS>
And
 
sir
 
she
 
_
they
_
have
long
wanted
to
consult
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
They
do
n't
think
of
me
 
an
old
father
!
<EOS>
I
am
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
M.
de
Bassompierre
 
not
<EOS>
so
 
<EOS>
that
ca
n't
be
!
<EOS>
But
Paulina
must
speak
for
herself
:
and
Dr.
Bretton
,
too
,
must
be
his
own
advocate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
little
late
.
<EOS>
Matters
are
advanced
,
it
seems
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
till
you
approve
,
nothing
is
done
 
only
they
love
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Only
!
"
<EOS>
he
echoed
.
  
<EOS>
Invested
by
fate
with
the
part
of
confidante
and
mediator
,
I
was
obliged
to
go
on
:
<EOS>
"
Hundreds
of
times
has
Dr.
Bretton
been
on
the
point
of
appealing
to
you
,
sir
;
but
,
with
all
his
high
courage
,
he
fears
you
mortally
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
well
 
<EOS>
he
may
well
fear
me
.
<EOS>
He
has
touched
the
best
thing
I
have
.
<EOS>
Had
he
but
let
her
alone
,
she
would
have
remained
a
child
for
years
yet
.
<EOS>
So
.
<EOS>
Are
they
engaged
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
could
not
become
engaged
without
your
permission
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
well
for
you
,
Miss
Snowe
,
to
talk
and
think
with
that
propriety
which
always
characterizes
you
;
but
this
matter
is
a
grief
to
me
;
my
little
girl
was
all
I
had
:
<EOS>
I
have
no
more
daughters
and
no
son
;
Bretton
might
as
well
have
looked
elsewhere
;
there
are
scores
of
rich
and
pretty
women
who
would
not
,
I
daresay
,
dislike
him
:
he
has
looks
,
and
conduct
,
and
connection
.
<EOS>
Would
nothing
serve
him
but
my
Polly
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
had
never
seen
your
"
Polly
,
"
others
might
and
would
have
pleased
him
 
your
niece
,
Miss
Fanshawe
,
for
instance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
would
have
given
him
Ginevra
with
all
my
heart
;
but
<EOS>
Polly
!
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
let
him
have
her
.
<EOS>
No
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
her
equal
,
"
he
affirmed
,
rather
gruffly
.
<EOS>
"
In
what
particular
is
he
her
match
?
<EOS>
They
talk
of
fortune
!
<EOS>
I
am
not
an
avaricious
or
interested
man
,
but
the
world
thinks
of
these
things
 
and
Polly
will
be
rich
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
that
is
known
,
"
said
I
:
"
all
Villette
knows
her
as
an
heiress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
they
talk
of
my
little
girl
in
that
light
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
do
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
fell
into
deep
thought
.
<EOS>
I
ventured
to
say
,
"
Would
you
,
sir
,
think
any
one
Paulina
's
match
?
<EOS>
Would
you
prefer
any
other
to
Dr.
Bretton
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
higher
rank
or
more
wealth
would
make
much
difference
in
your
feelings
towards
a
future
son
-
in
-
law
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
touch
me
there
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
at
the
aristocracy
of
Villette
 
you
would
not
like
them
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
 
never
a
duc
,
baron
,
or
vicomte
of
the
lot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
told
many
of
these
persons
think
about
her
,
sir
,
"
I
went
on
,
gaining
courage
on
finding
that
I
met
attention
rather
than
repulse
.
"
<EOS>
Other
suitors
will
come
,
therefore
,
if
Dr.
Bretton
is
refused
.
<EOS>
Wherever
you
go
,
I
suppose
,
aspirants
will
not
be
wanting
.
<EOS>
Independent
of
heiress
-
ship
,
it
appears
to
me
that
Paulina
charms
most
of
those
who
see
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
she
?
<EOS>
How
?
<EOS>
My
little
girl
is
not
thought
a
beauty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
Miss
de
Bassompierre
is
very
beautiful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
 
<EOS>
begging
your
pardon
,
Miss
Snowe
,
but
I
think
you
are
too
partial
.
<EOS>
I
like
Polly
:
<EOS>
I
like
all
her
ways
and
<EOS>
all
her
looks
 
<EOS>
but
then
I
am
her
father
;
and
even
I
never
thought
about
beauty
.
<EOS>
She
is
amusing
,
fairy
-
like
,
interesting
to
me
;
 
you
must
be
mistaken
in
supposing
her
handsome
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
attracts
,
sir
:
<EOS>
she
would
attract
without
the
advantages
of
your
wealth
and
position
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
wealth
and
position
!
<EOS>
Are
these
any
bait
to
Graham
?
<EOS>
If
I
thought
<EOS>
so
 
"
  
"
Dr.
Bretton
knows
these
points
perfectly
,
as
you
may
be
sure
,
M.
de
Bassompierre
,
and
values
them
as
any
gentleman
would
 
as
_
you
_
<EOS>
would
yourself
,
under
the
same
circumstances
 
<EOS>
but
they
are
not
his
baits
.
<EOS>
He
loves
your
daughter
very
much
;
he
feels
her
finest
qualities
,
and
they
influence
him
worthily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
has
my
little
pet
"
fine
qualities
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
,
sir
!
<EOS>
did
you
observe
her
that
evening
when
so
many
men
of
eminence
and
learning
dined
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
was
rather
struck
and
surprised
with
her
manner
that
day
;
its
womanliness
made
me
smile
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
did
you
see
those
accomplished
Frenchmen
gather
round
her
in
the
drawing
-
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
;
but
I
thought
it
was
by
way
of
relaxation
 
as
one
might
amuse
one
's
self
with
a
pretty
infant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
she
demeaned
herself
with
distinction
;
and
I
heard
the
French
gentlemen
say
she
was
"
pétrie
d'esprit
et
de
graces
.
"
<EOS>
Dr.
Bretton
thought
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
good
,
dear
child
,
that
is
certain
;
and
I
_
do
_
believe
she
has
some
character
.
<EOS>
When
I
think
of
it
,
I
was
once
ill
;
<EOS>
Polly
nursed
me
;
they
thought
I
should
die
;
she
,
I
recollect
,
grew
at
once
stronger
and
tenderer
as
I
grew
worse
in
health
.
<EOS>
And
as
I
recovered
,
what
a
sunbeam
she
was
in
my
sick
-
room
!
<EOS>
Yes
;
she
played
about
my
chair
as
noiselessly
and
as
cheerful
as
light
.
<EOS>
And
now
she
is
sought
in
marriage
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
part
with
her
,
"
said
he
,
and
he
groaned
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
known
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Bretton
<EOS>
so
long
,
"
I
suggested
,
"
it
would
be
less
like
separation
to
give
her
to
him
than
to
another
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
reflected
rather
gloomily
.
  
<EOS>
"
True
.
<EOS>
I
have
long
known
Louisa
Bretton
,
"
he
murmured
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
and
I
are
indeed
old
,
old
friends
;
a
sweet
,
kind
girl
she
was
when
she
was
young
.
<EOS>
You
talk
of
beauty
,
Miss
Snowe
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
she
_
was
handsome
,
if
you
will
 
tall
,
straight
,
and
blooming
 
not
the
mere
child
or
elf
<EOS>
my
Polly
seems
to
me
:
at
eighteen
,
Louisa
had
a
carriage
and
stature
fit
for
a
princess
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
comely
and
a
good
woman
now
.
<EOS>
The
lad
is
like
her
;
I
have
always
thought
so
,
and
favoured
and
wished
him
well
.
<EOS>
Now
he
repays
me
by
this
robbery
!
<EOS>
My
little
treasure
used
to
love
her
old
father
dearly
and
truly
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
over
now
,
doubtless
 
<EOS>
I
am
an
incumbrance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
door
opened
 
his
"
little
treasure
"
came
in
.
<EOS>
She
was
dressed
,
so
to
speak
,
in
evening
beauty
;
that
animation
which
sometimes
comes
with
the
close
of
day
,
warmed
her
eye
and
cheek
;
a
tinge
of
summer
crimson
heightened
her
complexion
;
her
curls
fell
full
and
long
on
her
lily
neck
;
her
white
dress
suited
the
heat
of
June
.
<EOS>
Thinking
me
alone
,
she
had
brought
in
her
hand
<EOS>
the
letter
just
written
 
brought
it
folded
but
unsealed
.
<EOS>
I
was
to
read
it
.
<EOS>
When
she
saw
her
father
,
her
tripping
step
faltered
a
little
,
paused
a
moment
 
<EOS>
the
colour
in
her
cheek
flowed
rosy
over
her
whole
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Polly
,
"
said
M.
de
Bassompierre
,
in
a
low
voice
,
with
a
grave
smile
,
"
do
you
blush
at
seeing
papa
?
<EOS>
That
is
something
new
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
blush
 
<EOS>
I
never
_
do
_
blush
,
"
affirmed
she
,
while
another
eddy
from
the
heart
sent
up
its
scarlet
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
thought
you
were
in
the
dining
-
room
,
and
I
wanted
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
thought
I
was
with
John
Graham
Bretton
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
But
he
has
just
been
called
out
:
he
will
be
back
soon
,
Polly
.
<EOS>
He
can
post
your
letter
for
you
;
it
will
save
Matthieu
a
"
course
,
"
as
he
calls
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
post
letters
,
"
said
she
,
rather
pettishly
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
do
with
them
,
then
?
 
<EOS>
come
here
and
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Both
her
mind
and
gesture
seemed
to
hesitate
a
second
 
to
say
"
Shall
I
come
?
"
 
<EOS>
but
she
approached
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
is
it
since
you
became
a
letter
-
writer
,
Polly
?
<EOS>
It
only
seems
yesterday
when
you
were
at
your
pot
-
hooks
,
labouring
away
absolutely
with
both
hands
at
the
pen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
they
are
not
letters
to
send
to
the
post
in
your
letter
-
bag
;
they
are
only
notes
,
which
I
give
now
and
then
into
the
person
's
hands
,
just
to
satisfy
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
person
!
<EOS>
That
means
Miss
Snowe
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
papa
 
not
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
then
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
Mrs.
Bretton
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
papa
 
not
Mrs.
Bretton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
,
then
,
my
little
daughter
?
<EOS>
Tell
papa
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
papa
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
with
earnestness
,
"
I
will
 
I
_
will
_
tell
you
the
truth
 
all
the
truth
;
I
am
glad
to
tell
you
 
glad
,
though
I
tremble
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
_
did
_
tremble
:
growing
excitement
,
kindling
feeling
,
and
also
gathering
courage
,
shook
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
to
hide
my
actions
from
you
,
papa
.
<EOS>
I
fear
you
and
love
you
above
everything
but
God
.
<EOS>
Read
the
letter
;
look
at
the
address
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
laid
it
on
his
knee
.
<EOS>
He
took
it
up
and
read
it
through
;
his
hand
shaking
,
his
eyes
glistening
meantime
.
  
<EOS>
He
re
-
folded
it
,
and
viewed
the
writer
with
a
strange
,
tender
,
mournful
amaze
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
_
<EOS>
she
_
write
<EOS>
so
 
the
little
thing
that
stood
at
my
knee
<EOS>
but
yesterday
?
<EOS>
Can
she
feel
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
is
it
wrong
?
<EOS>
Does
it
pain
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
wrong
in
it
,
my
innocent
little
Mary
;
but
it
pains
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
papa
,
listen
!
<EOS>
You
shall
not
be
pained
by
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
give
up
everything
 
almost
"
(
correcting
herself
)
;
"
I
would
die
rather
than
make
you
unhappy
;
that
would
be
too
wicked
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
shuddered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
the
letter
not
please
you
?
<EOS>
Must
it
not
go
?
<EOS>
Must
it
be
torn
?

It
shall
,
for
your
sake
,
if
you
order
it

<EOS>
"
I
order
nothing

<EOS>
"
Order
something

papa

express
your
wish

only
do
n't
hurt

do
n't
grieve
Graham

I
can
not

_
can
not
_
bear
that
.

I
love
you

papa

I
love
Graham
too
 
because
 
because
 
it
is
impossible
to
help
it

This
splendid
Graham
is
a
young
scamp
,
<EOS>
Polly
 
that
is
my
present
notion
of
him
:
it
will
surprise
you
to
hear
that
,
for
my
part
,
I
do
not
love
him
one
whit
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
years
ago
I
saw
something
in
that
lad
's
eye
<EOS>
I
never
quite
fathomed
 
something
his
mother
has
not
 
a
depth
which
warned
a
man
not
to
wade
into
that
stream
too
far
;
now
,
suddenly
,
I
find
myself
taken
over
the
crown
of
the
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
you
do
n't
 
you
have
not
fallen
in
;
you
are
safe
on
the
bank
;
you
can
do
as
you
please
;
your
power
is
despotic
;
you
can
shut
me
up
in
a
convent
,
and
break
Graham
's
heart
to
-
morrow
,
if
you
choose
to
be
so
cruel
.
<EOS>
Now
,
autocrat
,
now
czar
,
will
you
do
this
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Off
with
him
to
Siberia
,
red
whiskers
and
all
;
I
say
,
I
do
n't
like
him
,
Polly
,
and
I
wonder
that
you
should
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
"
said
she
,
"
<EOS>
do
you
know
you
are
very
naughty
?
<EOS>
I
never
saw
you
look
so
disagreeable
,
so
unjust
,
so
almost
vindictive
before
.
<EOS>
There
is
an
expression
in
your
face
which
does
not
belong
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Off
with
him
!
"
pursued
Mr.
Home
,
who
certainly
did
look
sorely
crossed
and
annoyed
 
even
a
little
bitter
;
"
but
,
I
suppose
,
if
he
went
,
Polly
would
pack
a
bundle
and
run
after
him
;
her
heart
is
fairly
won
 
won
,
and
weaned
from
her
old
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
I
say
it
is
naughty
<EOS>
,
it
is
decidedly
wrong
,
to
talk
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
I
am
_
not
_
weaned
from
you
,
and
no
human
being
and
no
mortal
influence
<EOS>
_
can
_
wean
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Be
married
,
Polly
!
<EOS>
Espouse
the
red
whiskers
.
<EOS>
Cease
to
be
a
daughter
;
go
and
be
a
wife
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Red
whiskers
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
you
mean
,
papa
.
<EOS>
You
should
take
care
of
prejudice
.
<EOS>
You
sometimes
say
to
me
that
all
the
Scotch
,
your
countrymen
,
are
the
victims
of
prejudice
.
<EOS>
It
is
proved
now
,
I
think
,
when
no
distinction
is
to
be
made
between
red
and
deep
nut
-
brown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
the
prejudiced
old
Scotchman
;
go
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
stood
looking
at
him
a
minute
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
show
firmness
,
superiority
to
taunts
;
knowing
her
father
's
character
,
guessing
his
few
foibles
<EOS>
,
she
had
expected
the
sort
of
scene
which
was
now
transpiring
;
it
did
not
take
her
by
surprise
,
and
she
desired
to
let
it
pass
with
dignity
,
reliant
upon
reaction
.
<EOS>
Her
dignity
stood
her
in
no
stead
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
her
soul
melted
in
her
eyes
;
she
fell
on
his
neck
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
leave
you
,
papa
;
I
'll
never
leave
you
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
pain
you
!
<EOS>
I
'll
never
pain
you
!
"
<EOS>
was
her
cry
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lamb
!
<EOS>
my
treasure
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
the
loving
though
rugged
sire
.
<EOS>
He
said
no
more
for
the
moment
;
indeed
,
those
two
words
were
hoarse
.
  
<EOS>
The
room
was
now
darkening
.
<EOS>
I
heard
a
movement
,
a
step
without
.
<EOS>
Thinking
it
might
be
a
servant
coming
with
candles
,
I
gently
opened
,
to
prevent
intrusion
.
<EOS>
In
the
ante
-
room
stood
no
servant
:
a
tall
gentleman
was
placing
his
hat
on
the
table
,
drawing
off
his
gloves
slowly
 
lingering
,
waiting
<EOS>
,
it
seemed
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
called
me
neither
by
sign
nor
word
;
yet
his
eye
said
:
 
"
Lucy
,
come
here
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
went
.
  
<EOS>
Over
his
face
a
smile
flowed
,
while
he
looked
down
on
me
:
no
temper
,
save
his
own
,
would
have
expressed
by
a
smile
the
sort
of
agitation
which
now
fevered
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
M.
de
Bassompierre
is
there
 
is
he
not
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
,
pointing
to
the
library
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
noticed
me
at
dinner
?
<EOS>
He
understood
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Graham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
brought
up
for
judgment
,
then
,
and
so
is
_
<EOS>
she
_
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Home
"
<EOS>
(
we
now
and
always
continued
to
term
him
Mr.
Home
at
times
)
"
is
talking
to
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
These
are
sharp
moments
,
Lucy
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
quite
stirred
up
;
his
young
hand
trembled
;
a
vital
(
I
was
going
to
write
_
mortal
_
,
but
such
words
ill
apply
to
one
all
living
like
him
)
 
<EOS>
a
vital
suspense
now
held
,
now
hurried
,
his
breath
:
in
all
this
trouble
his
smile
never
faded
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
_
very
_
angry
,
Lucy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
She
_
is
very
faithful
,
Graham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
will
be
done
unto
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Graham
,
your
star
must
be
fortunate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Must
it
?
<EOS>
Kind
prophet
!
<EOS>
So
cheered
,
I
should
be
a
faint
heart
indeed
to
quail
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
find
all
women
faithful
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
love
them
,
and
I
do
.
<EOS>
My
mother
is
good
;
_
she
_
is
divine
;
and
_
you
_
are
true
as
steel
.
<EOS>
Are
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Graham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
give
me
thy
hand
,
my
little
god
-
sister
:
it
is
a
friendly
little
hand
to
me
,
and
always
has
been
.
<EOS>
And
now
for
the
great
venture
.
<EOS>
God
be
with
the
right
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
say
Amen
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
turned
,
and
waited
till
I
said
"
Amen
!
"
 
<EOS>
which
I
did
to
please
him
:
the
old
charm
,
in
doing
as
he
bid
me
,
came
back
.
<EOS>
I
wished
him
success
;
and
successful
I
knew
he
would
be
.
<EOS>
He
was
born
victor
,
as
some
are
born
vanquished
.
  
<EOS>
"
Follow
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
;
and
I
followed
him
into
Mr.
Home
's
presence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
he
asked
,
"
what
is
my
sentence
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
father
looked
at
him
:
the
daughter
kept
her
face
hid
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Bretton
,
"
said
Mr.
Home
,
"
you
have
given
me
the
usual
reward
of
hospitality
.
<EOS>
I
entertained
you
;
you
have
taken
my
best
.
<EOS>
I
was
always
glad
to
see
you
;
you
were
glad
to
see
the
one
precious
thing
I
had
.
<EOS>
You
spoke
me
fair
;
and
,
meantime
,
I
will
not
say
you
_
robbed
<EOS>
_
me
,
but
I
am
bereaved
,
and
what
I
have
lost
,
_
you
_
,
it
seems
,
have
won
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
can
not
repent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Repent
!
<EOS>
Not
you
!
<EOS>
You
triumph
,
no
doubt
:
John
Graham
,
you
descended
partly
from
a
Highlander
and
a
chief
,
and
there
is
a
trace
of
the
Celt
in
all
you
look
,
speak
,
and
think
.
<EOS>
You
have
his
cunning
and
his
charm
.
<EOS>
The
red
 
<EOS>
(
Well
then
,
Polly
,
the
_
fair
_
)
hair
,
the
tongue
of
guile
,
and
brain
of
wile
,
are
all
come
down
by
inheritance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
_
feel
_
honest
enough
,
"
said
Graham
;
and
a
genuine
English
blush
covered
his
face
with
its
warm
witness
of
sincerity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
"
he
added
,
"
I
wo
n't
deny
that
in
some
respects
you
accuse
me
justly
.
<EOS>
In
your
presence
I
have
always
had
a
thought
which
I
dared
not
show
you
.
<EOS>
I
did
truly
regard
you
as
the
possessor
of
the
most
valuable
thing
the
world
owns
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
wished
for
it
:
I
tried
for
it
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
ask
for
it
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
John
,
you
ask
much
.
"
  
"
Very
much
,
sir
.
<EOS>
It
must
come
from
your
generosity
,
as
a
gift
;
from
your
justice
,
as
a
reward
.
<EOS>
I
can
never
earn
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
Listen
to
the
Highland
tongue
!
"
said
Mr.
Home
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Look
up
,
Polly
!
<EOS>
Answer
this
"
braw
wooer
;
"
send
him
away
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
up
.
<EOS>
She
shyly
glanced
at
her
eager
,
handsome
suitor
.
<EOS>
She
gazed
tenderly
on
her
furrowed
sire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
I
love
you
both
,
"
said
she
;
"
I
can
take
care
of
you
both
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
send
Graham
away
 
<EOS>
he
can
live
here
;
he
will
be
no
inconvenience
,
"
she
alleged
with
that
simplicity
of
phraseology
which
at
times
was
wo
nt
to
make
both
her
father
and
Graham
smile
.
<EOS>
They
smiled
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
a
prodigious
inconvenience
to
me
,
"
still
persisted
Mr.
Home
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
him
,
Polly
,
he
is
too
tall
;
he
is
in
my
way
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
to
march
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
get
used
to
him
,
papa
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
exceedingly
tall
to
me
at
first
 
like
a
tower
when
I
looked
up
at
him
;
but
,
on
the
whole
,
I
would
rather
not
have
him
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
object
to
him
altogether
,
Polly
;
I
can
do
without
a
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
I
should
never
have
requested
the
best
man
in
the
land
to
stand
to
me
in
that
relation
.
<EOS>
Dismiss
this
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
has
known
you
so
long
,
papa
,
and
suits
you
so
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Suits
_
me
_
,
forsooth
!
<EOS>
Yes
;
he
has
pretended
to
make
my
opinions
and
tastes
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
has
humoured
me
for
good
reasons
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
Polly
,
you
and
I
will
bid
him
good
-
by
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Till
to
-
morrow
only
.
<EOS>
Shake
hands
with
Graham
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
:
<EOS>
I
think
not
:
I
am
not
friends
with
him
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
think
to
coax
me
between
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
indeed
,
you
_
are
_
friends
.
<EOS>
Graham
,
stretch
out
your
right
hand
.
<EOS>
Papa
,
put
out
yours
.
<EOS>
Now
,
let
them
touch
.
<EOS>
Papa
,
do
n't
be
stiff
;
close
your
fingers
;
be
pliant
 
there
!
<EOS>
But
that
is
not
a
clasp
 
<EOS>
it
is
a
grasp
?
<EOS>
Papa
,
you
grasp
like
a
vice
.
<EOS>
You
crush
Graham
's
hand
to
the
bone
;
you
hurt
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
must
have
hurt
him
;
for
he
wore
a
massive
ring
,
set
round
with
brilliants
,
of
which
the
sharp
facets
cut
into
Graham
's
flesh
and
drew
blood
:
but
pain
only
made
Dr.
John
laugh
,
as
anxiety
had
made
him
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
with
me
into
my
study
,
"
at
last
said
Mr.
Home
to
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
They
went
.
<EOS>
Their
intercourse
was
not
long
,
but
I
suppose
it
was
conclusive
.
<EOS>
The
suitor
had
to
undergo
an
interrogatory
and
a
scrutiny
on
many
things
.
<EOS>
Whether
Dr.
Bretton
was
at
times
guileful
in
look
and
language
or
not
,
there
was
a
sound
foundation
below
.
<EOS>
His
answers
,
I
understood
afterwards
,
evinced
both
wisdom
and
integrity
.
<EOS>
He
had
managed
his
affairs
well
.
<EOS>
He
had
struggled
through
entanglements
;
his
fortunes
were
in
the
way
of
retrieval
;
he
proved
himself
in
a
position
to
marry
.
  
<EOS>
Once
more
the
father
and
lover
appeared
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
M.
de
Bassompierre
shut
the
door
;
he
pointed
to
his
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
her
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Take
her
,
John
Bretton
:
and
may
God
deal
with
you
as
you
deal
with
her
!
"
     
<EOS>
Not
long
after
,
perhaps
a
fortnight
,
I
saw
three
persons
,
Count
de
Bassompierre
,
his
daughter
,
and
Dr.
Graham
Bretton
,
sitting
on
one
seat
,
under
a
low
-
spreading
and
umbrageous
tree
,
in
the
grounds
of
the
palace
at
Bois
l'Etang
.
<EOS>
They
had
come
thither
to
enjoy
a
summer
evening
:
<EOS>
outside
the
magnificent
gates
their
carriage
waited
to
take
them
home
;
the
green
sweeps
of
turf
spread
round
them
quiet
and
dim
;
the
palace
rose
at
a
distance
,
white
as
a
crag
on
Pentelicus
<EOS>
;
the
evening
star
shone
above
it
;
a
forest
of
flowering
shrubs
embalmed
the
climate
of
this
spot
;
the
hour
was
still
and
sweet
;
the
scene
,
but
for
this
group
,
was
solitary
.
  
<EOS>
Paulina
sat
between
the
two
gentlemen
:
while
they
conversed
,
her
little
hands
were
busy
at
some
work
;
I
thought
at
first
she
was
binding
a
nosegay
.
<EOS>
No
;
with
the
tiny
pair
of
scissors
,
glittering
in
her
lap
,
she
had
severed
spoils
from
each
manly
head
beside
her
,
and
was
now
occupied
in
plaiting
together
the
grey
lock
and
the
golden
wave
.
<EOS>
The
plait
woven
 
<EOS>
no
silk
-
thread
being
at
hand
to
bind
it
 
a
tress
of
her
own
hair
was
made
to
serve
that
purpose
;
she
tied
it
like
a
knot
,
prisoned
it
in
a
locket
,
and
laid
it
on
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
she
,
"
there
is
an
amulet
made
,
which
has
virtue
to
keep
you
two
always
friends
.
<EOS>
You
can
never
quarrel
so
long
as
I
wear
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
An
amulet
was
indeed
made
,
a
spell
framed
which
rendered
enmity
impossible
.
<EOS>
She
was
become
a
bond
to
both
,
an
influence
over
each
,
a
mutual
concord
.
<EOS>
From
them
she
drew
her
happiness
,
and
what
she
borrowed
,
she
,
with
interest
,
gave
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
,
indeed
,
such
happiness
on
earth
?
"
<EOS>
I
asked
,
as
I
watched
the
father
,
the
daughter
,
the
future
husband
,
now
united
 
<EOS>
all
blessed
and
blessing
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
;
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
Without
any
colouring
of
romance
,
or
any
exaggeration
of
fancy
,
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
Some
real
lives
do
 
for
some
certain
days
or
years
 
actually
anticipate
the
happiness
of
Heaven
;
and
,
I
believe
,
if
such
perfect
happiness
is
once
felt
by
good
people
(
to
the
wicked
it
never
comes
)
,
its
sweet
effect
is
never
wholly
lost
.
<EOS>
Whatever
trials
follow
,
whatever
pains
of
sickness
or
shades
of
death
,
the
glory
precedent
still
shines
through
,
cheering
the
keen
anguish
,
and
tinging
the
deep
cloud
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
go
farther
.
<EOS>
I
_
<EOS>
do
_
believe
there
are
some
human
beings
so
born
,
so
reared
,
so
guided
from
a
soft
cradle
to
a
calm
and
late
grave
,
that
no
excessive
suffering
penetrates
their
lot
,
and
no
tempestuous
blackness
overcasts
their
journey
.
<EOS>
And
often
,
these
are
not
pampered
,
selfish
beings
,
but
Nature
's
elect
,
harmonious
and
benign
;
men
and
women
mild
with
charity
,
kind
agents
of
God
's
kind
attributes
.
  
<EOS>
Let
me
not
delay
the
happy
truth
.
<EOS>
Graham
Bretton
and
Paulina
de
Bassompierre
were
married
,
and
such
an
agent
did
Dr.
Bretton
prove
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
with
time
degenerate
;
his
faults
decayed
,
his
virtues
ripened
;
he
rose
in
intellectual
refinement
,
he
won
in
moral
profit
:
all
dregs
filtered
away
,
the
clear
wine
settled
bright
and
tranquil
.
<EOS>
Bright
,
too
,
was
the
destiny
of
his
sweet
wife
.
<EOS>
She
kept
her
husband
's
love
,
she
aided
in
his
progress
 
of
his
happiness
<EOS>
she
was
the
corner
stone
.
  
<EOS>
This
pair
was
blessed
indeed
,
for
years
brought
them
,
with
great
prosperity
,
great
goodness
:
they
imparted
with
open
hand
,
yet
wisely
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
they
knew
crosses
,
disappointments
,
difficulties
;
but
these
were
well
borne
.
<EOS>
More
than
once
,
too
,
they
had
to
look
on
Him
whose
face
flesh
scarce
can
see
and
live
:
they
had
to
pay
their
tribute
to
the
King
of
Terrors
.
<EOS>
In
the
fulness
of
years
,
M.
de
Bassompierre
was
taken
:
in
ripe
old
age
departed
Louisa
Bretton
.
<EOS>
Once
even
there
rose
a
cry
in
their
halls
,
of
Rachel
weeping
for
her
children
;
but
others
sprang
healthy
and
blooming
to
replace
the
lost
:
Dr.
Bretton
saw
himself
live
again
in
a
son
who
inherited
his
looks
and
his
disposition
;
he
had
stately
daughters
,
too
,
like
himself
:
these
children
he
reared
with
a
suave
,
yet
a
firm
hand
;
they
grew
up
according
to
inheritance
and
nurture
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
do
but
speak
the
truth
when
I
say
that
these
two
lives
of
Graham
and
Paulina
were
blessed
,
like
that
of
Jacob
's
favoured
son
,
with
"
blessings
of
Heaven
above
,
blessings
of
the
deep
that
lies
under
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
so
,
for
God
saw
that
it
was
good
.
    
CLOUD
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
so
for
all
.
<EOS>
What
then
?
<EOS>
His
will
be
done
,
as
done
it
surely
will
be
,
whether
we
humble
ourselves
to
resignation
or
not
.
<EOS>
The
impulse
of
creation
forwards
it
;
the
strength
of
powers
,
seen
and
unseen
,
has
its
fulfilment
in
charge
.
<EOS>
Proof
of
a
life
to
come
must
be
given
.
<EOS>
In
fire
and
in
blood
,
if
needful
,
must
that
proof
be
written
.
<EOS>
In
fire
and
in
blood
do
we
trace
the
record
throughout
nature
.
<EOS>
In
fire
and
in
blood
does
it
cross
our
own
experience
.
<EOS>
Sufferer
,
faint
not
through
terror
of
this
burning
evidence
.
<EOS>
Tired
wayfarer
,
gird
up
thy
loins
;
look
upward
,
march
onward
.
<EOS>
Pilgrims
and
brother
mourners
,
join
in
friendly
company
.
<EOS>
Dark
through
the
wilderness
of
this
world
stretches
the
way
for
most
of
us
:
equal
and
steady
be
our
tread
;
be
our
cross
our
banner
.
<EOS>
For
staff
we
have
His
promise
,
whose
"
word
is
tried
,
whose
way
perfect
:
"
for
present
hope
His
providence
,
"
who
gives
the
shield
of
salvation
,
whose
gentleness
makes
great
;
"
for
final
home
<EOS>
His
bosom
,
who
"
dwells
in
the
height
of
Heaven
;
"
for
crowning
prize
a
glory
,
exceeding
and
eternal
.
<EOS>
Let
us
so
run
that
we
may
obtain
:
let
us
endure
hardness
as
good
soldiers
;
let
us
finish
our
course
,
and
keep
the
faith
,
reliant
in
the
issue
to
come
off
more
than
conquerors
:
"
Art
thou
not
from
everlasting
mine
Holy
One
?
<EOS>
WE
SHALL
NOT
DIE
!
"
  
<EOS>
On
a
Thursday
morning
we
were
all
assembled
in
classe
,
waiting
for
the
lesson
of
literature
.
<EOS>
The
hour
was
come
;
we
expected
the
master
.
  
<EOS>
The
pupils
of
the
first
classe
sat
very
still
;
the
cleanly
-
written
compositions
prepared
since
the
last
lesson
lay
ready
before
them
,
neatly
tied
with
ribbon
,
waiting
to
be
gathered
by
the
hand
of
the
Professor
as
he
made
his
rapid
round
of
the
desks
.
<EOS>
The
month
was
July
,
the
morning
fine
,
the
glass
-
door
stood
ajar
,
through
it
played
a
fresh
breeze
,
and
plants
,
growing
at
the
lintel
,
waved
,
bent
,
looked
in
,
seeming
to
whisper
tidings
.
  
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
was
not
always
quite
punctual
;
we
scarcely
wondered
at
his
being
a
little
late
,
but
we
wondered
when
the
door
at
last
opened
and
,
instead
of
him
with
his
swiftness
and
his
fire
,
there
came
quietly
upon
us
the
cautious
Madame
Beck
.
  
<EOS>
She
approached
M.
Paul
's
desk
;
she
stood
before
it
;
she
drew
round
her
the
light
shawl
covering
her
shoulders
;
beginning
to
speak
in
low
,
yet
firm
tones
,
and
with
a
fixed
gaze
,
she
said
,
"
This
morning
there
will
be
no
lesson
of
literature
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
second
paragraph
of
her
address
followed
,
after
about
two
minutes
'
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
probable
the
lessons
will
be
suspended
for
a
week
.
<EOS>
I
shall
require
at
least
that
space
of
time
to
find
an
efficient
substitute
for
M.
Emanuel
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
it
shall
be
our
study
to
fill
the
blanks
usefully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
Professor
,
ladies
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
intends
,
if
possible
,
duly
to
take
leave
of
you
.
<EOS>
At
the
present
moment
he
has
not
leisure
for
that
ceremony
.
<EOS>
He
is
preparing
for
a
long
voyage
.
<EOS>
A
very
sudden
and
urgent
summons
of
duty
calls
him
to
a
great
distance
.
<EOS>
He
has
decided
to
leave
Europe
for
an
indefinite
time
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
may
tell
you
more
himself
.
<EOS>
Ladies
,
instead
of
the
usual
lesson
with
M.
Emanuel
,
you
will
,
this
morning
,
read
English
with
Mademoiselle
Lucy
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
bent
her
head
courteously
,
drew
closer
the
folds
of
her
shawl
,
and
passed
from
the
classe
.
  
<EOS>
A
great
silence
fell
:
then
a
murmur
went
round
the
room
:
I
believe
some
pupils
wept
.
  
<EOS>
Some
time
elapsed
.
<EOS>
The
noise
,
the
whispering
,
the
occasional
sobbing
increased
.
<EOS>
I
became
conscious
of
a
relaxation
of
discipline
,
a
sort
of
growing
disorder
,
as
if
my
girls
felt
that
vigilance
was
withdrawn
,
and
that
surveillance
had
virtually
left
the
classe
.
<EOS>
Habit
and
the
sense
of
duty
enabled
me
to
rally
quickly
,
to
rise
in
my
usual
way
,
to
speak
in
my
usual
tone
,
to
enjoin
,
and
finally
to
establish
quiet
.
<EOS>
I
made
the
English
reading
long
and
close
.
<EOS>
I
kept
them
at
it
the
whole
morning
.
<EOS>
I
remember
feeling
a
sentiment
of
impatience
towards
the
pupils
who
sobbed
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
their
emotion
was
not
of
much
value
:
it
was
only
an
hysteric
agitation
.
<EOS>
I
told
them
so
unsparingly
.
<EOS>
I
half
ridiculed
them
.
<EOS>
I
was
severe
.
<EOS>
The
truth
was
,
I
could
not
do
with
their
tears
,
or
that
gasping
sound
;
I
could
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
A
rather
weak
-
minded
,
low
-
spirited
pupil
kept
it
up
when
the
others
had
done
;
relentless
necessity
obliged
and
assisted
me
so
to
accost
her
,
that
she
dared
not
carry
on
the
demonstration
,
that
she
was
forced
to
conquer
the
convulsion
.
  
<EOS>
That
girl
would
have
had
a
right
to
hate
me
,
except
that
,
when
school
was
over
and
her
companions
departing
,
I
ordered
her
to
stay
,
and
when
they
were
gone
,
I
did
what
I
had
never
done
to
one
among
them
before
 
pressed
her
to
my
heart
and
kissed
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
But
,
this
impulse
yielded
to
,
I
speedily
put
her
out
of
the
classe
,
for
,
upon
that
poignant
strain
,
she
wept
more
bitterly
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
I
filled
with
occupation
every
minute
of
that
day
,
and
should
have
liked
to
sit
up
all
night
if
I
might
have
kept
a
candle
burning
;
the
night
,
however
,
proved
a
bad
time
,
and
left
bad
effects
,
preparing
me
ill
for
the
next
day
's
ordeal
of
insufferable
gossip
.
<EOS>
Of
course
this
news
fell
under
general
discussion
.
<EOS>
Some
little
reserve
had
accompanied
the
first
surprise
:
that
soon
wore
off
;
every
mouth
opened
;
every
tongue
wagged
;
teachers
,
pupils
,
the
very
servants
,
mouthed
the
name
of
"
Emanuel
.
"
<EOS>
He
,
whose
connection
with
the
school
was
contemporary
with
its
commencement
,
thus
suddenly
to
withdraw
!
<EOS>
All
felt
it
strange
.
  
<EOS>
They
talked
so
much
,
so
long
,
so
often
,
that
,
out
of
the
very
multitude
of
their
words
and
rumours
,
grew
at
last
some
intelligence
.
<EOS>
About
the
third
day
I
heard
it
said
that
he
was
to
sail
in
a
week
;
then
 
that
he
was
bound
for
the
West
Indies
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
Madame
Beck
's
face
,
and
into
her
eyes
,
for
disproof
or
confirmation
of
this
report
;
I
perused
her
all
over
for
information
,
but
no
part
of
her
disclosed
more
than
what
was
unperturbed
and
commonplace
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
secession
was
an
immense
loss
to
her
,
"
she
alleged
.
<EOS>
"
She
did
not
know
how
she
should
fill
up
the
vacancy
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
used
to
her
kinsman
,
he
had
become
her
right
hand
;
what
should
she
do
without
him
?
<EOS>
She
had
opposed
the
step
,
but
M.
Paul
had
convinced
her
it
was
his
duty
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
said
all
this
in
public
,
in
classe
,
at
the
dinner
-
table
,
speaking
audibly
to
Zélie
St.
Pierre
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
was
it
his
duty
?
<EOS>
"
I
could
have
asked
her
that
.
<EOS>
I
had
impulses
to
take
hold
of
her
suddenly
,
as
she
calmly
passed
me
in
classe
,
to
stretch
out
my
hand
and
grasp
her
fast
,
and
say
,
"
Stop
.
<EOS>
Let
us
hear
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
matter
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Why
_
is
it
his
duty
to
go
into
banishment
?
"
<EOS>
But
Madame
always
addressed
some
other
teacher
,
and
never
looked
at
me
,
never
seemed
conscious
I
could
have
a
care
in
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
The
week
wore
on
.
<EOS>
Nothing
more
was
said
about
M.
Emanuel
coming
to
bid
us
good
-
by
;
and
none
seemed
anxious
for
his
coming
;
none
questioned
whether
or
not
he
would
come
;
none
betrayed
torment
lest
he
should
depart
silent
and
unseen
;
incessantly
did
they
talk
,
and
never
,
in
all
their
talk
,
touched
on
this
vital
point
.
<EOS>
As
to
Madame
,
she
of
course
could
see
him
,
and
say
to
him
as
much
as
she
pleased
.
<EOS>
What
should
_
<EOS>
she
<EOS>
_
care
whether
or
not
he
appeared
in
the
schoolroom
?
  
<EOS>
The
week
consumed
.
<EOS>
We
were
told
that
he
was
going
on
such
a
day
,
that
his
destination
was
"
Basseterre
in
Guadaloupe
:
"
the
business
which
called
him
abroad
related
to
a
friend
's
interests
,
not
his
own
<EOS>
:
I
thought
as
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
Basseterre
in
Guadaloupe
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
little
sleep
about
this
time
,
but
whenever
I
_
did
_
slumber
,
it
followed
infallibly
that
I
was
quickly
roused
with
a
start
,
while
the
words
"
Basseterre
,
"
"
Guadaloupe
,
"
seemed
pronounced
over
my
pillow
,
or
ran
athwart
the
darkness
round
and
before
me
,
in
zigzag
characters
of
red
or
violet
light
.
  
<EOS>
For
what
I
felt
there
was
no
help
,
and
how
could
I
help
feeling
?
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
had
been
very
kind
to
me
of
late
days
;
he
had
been
growing
hourly
better
and
kinder
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
a
month
since
we
had
settled
the
theological
difference
,
and
in
all
that
time
there
had
been
no
quarrel
.
<EOS>
Nor
had
our
peace
been
the
cold
daughter
of
divorce
;
we
had
not
lived
aloof
;
he
had
come
oftener
,
he
had
talked
with
me
more
than
before
;
he
had
spent
hours
with
me
,
with
temper
soothed
,
with
eye
content
,
with
manner
home
-
like
and
mild
.
<EOS>
Kind
subjects
of
conversation
had
grown
between
us
;
he
had
inquired
into
my
plans
of
life
,
and
I
had
communicated
them
;
the
school
project
pleased
him
;
he
made
me
repeat
it
more
than
once
,
though
he
called
it
an
Alnaschar
dream
.
<EOS>
The
jar
was
over
;
the
mutual
understanding
was
settling
and
fixing
;
feelings
of
union
and
hope
made
themselves
profoundly
felt
in
the
heart
;
affection
and
deep
esteem
and
dawning
trust
had
each
fastened
its
bond
.
  
<EOS>
What
quiet
lessons
I
had
about
this
time
!
<EOS>
No
more
taunts
on
my
"
intellect
,
"
no
more
menaces
of
grating
public
shows
!
<EOS>
How
sweetly
,
for
the
jealous
gibe
,
and
the
more
jealous
,
half
-
passionate
eulogy
,
were
substituted
a
mute
,
indulgent
help
,
a
fond
guidance
,
and
a
tender
forbearance
which
forgave
but
never
praised
.
<EOS>
There
were
times
when
he
would
sit
for
many
minutes
and
not
speak
at
all
;
and
when
dusk
or
duty
brought
separation
,
he
would
leave
with
words
like
these
,
"
<EOS>
Il
est
doux
,
le
repos
!
<EOS>
Il
est
précieux
le
calme
bonheur
!
"
  
<EOS>
One
evening
,
not
ten
short
days
since
,
he
joined
me
whilst
walking
in
my
alley
.
<EOS>
He
took
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
looked
up
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
meant
to
arrest
my
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bonne
petite
amie
<EOS>
!
"
said
he
,
softly
;
"
douce
consolatrice
!
"
<EOS>
But
through
his
touch
,
and
with
his
words
,
a
new
feeling
and
a
strange
thought
found
a
course
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
he
was
becoming
more
than
friend
or
brother
?
<EOS>
Did
his
look
speak
a
kindness
beyond
fraternity
or
amity
?
  
<EOS>
His
eloquent
look
had
more
to
say
,
his
hand
drew
me
forward
,
his
interpreting
lips
stirred
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Not
now
.
<EOS>
Here
into
the
twilight
alley
broke
an
interruption
:
it
came
dual
and
ominous
:
<EOS>
we
faced
two
bodeful
forms
 
a
woman
's
and
a
priest
's
 
Madame
Beck
and
Père
Silas
.
  
<EOS>
The
aspect
of
the
latter
I
shall
never
forget
.
<EOS>
On
the
first
impulse
it
expressed
a
Jean
-
Jacques
sensibility
,
stirred
by
the
signs
of
affection
just
surprised
;
then
,
immediately
,
darkened
over
it
the
jaundice
of
ecclesiastical
jealousy
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
to
_
me
_
with
unction
.
<EOS>
He
looked
on
his
pupil
with
sternness
.
<EOS>
As
to
Madame
Beck
,
she
,
of
course
,
saw
nothing
 
nothing
;
though
her
kinsman
retained
in
her
presence
the
hand
of
the
heretic
foreigner
,
not
suffering
withdrawal
,
but
clasping
it
close
and
fast
.
  
<EOS>
Following
these
incidents
,
that
sudden
announcement
of
departure
had
struck
me
at
first
as
incredible
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
was
only
frequent
repetition
,
and
the
credence
of
the
hundred
and
fifty
minds
round
me
,
which
forced
on
me
its
full
acceptance
.
<EOS>
As
to
that
week
of
suspense
,
with
its
blank
,
yet
burning
days
,
which
brought
from
him
no
word
of
explanation
 
<EOS>
I
remember
,
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
describe
its
passage
.
  
<EOS>
The
last
day
broke
.
<EOS>
Now
would
he
visit
us
.
<EOS>
Now
he
would
come
and
speak
his
farewell
,
or
he
would
vanish
mute
,
and
be
seen
by
us
nevermore
.
  
<EOS>
This
alternative
seemed
to
be
present
in
the
mind
of
not
a
living
creature
in
that
school
.
<EOS>
All
rose
at
the
usual
hour
;
all
breakfasted
as
usual
;
all
,
without
reference
to
,
or
apparent
thought
of
their
late
Professor
,
betook
themselves
with
wonted
phlegm
to
their
ordinary
duties
.
  
<EOS>
So
oblivious
was
the
house
,
so
tame
<EOS>
,
so
trained
its
proceedings
,
so
inexpectant
its
aspect
 
<EOS>
I
scarce
knew
how
to
breathe
in
an
atmosphere
thus
stagnant
,
thus
smothering
.
<EOS>
Would
no
one
lend
me
a
voice
?
<EOS>
Had
no
one
a
wish
,
no
one
<EOS>
a
word
,
no
one
a
prayer
to
which
I
could
say
 
Amen
?
  
<EOS>
I
had
seen
them
unanimous
in
demand
for
the
merest
trifle
 
a
treat
,
a
holiday
,
a
lesson
's
remission
;
they
could
not
,
they
_
would
_
not
now
band
to
besiege
Madame
Beck
,
and
insist
on
a
last
interview
with
a
Master
who
had
certainly
been
loved
,
at
least
by
some
 
loved
as
_
<EOS>
they
_
could
love
 
<EOS>
but
,
oh
!
<EOS>
what
_
is
_
the
love
of
the
multitude
?
  
<EOS>
I
knew
where
he
lived
:
I
knew
where
he
was
to
be
heard
of
,
or
communicated
with
;
the
distance
was
scarce
<EOS>
a
stone's
-
throw
:
<EOS>
had
it
been
in
the
next
room
 
<EOS>
unsummoned
,
I
could
make
no
use
of
my
knowledge
.
<EOS>
To
follow
,
to
seek
out
,
to
remind
,
to
recall
 
for
these
things
I
had
no
faculty
.
  
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
might
have
passed
within
reach
of
my
arm
:
had
he
passed
silent
and
unnoticing
,
silent
and
stirless
<EOS>
should
I
have
suffered
him
to
go
by
.
  
<EOS>
Morning
wasted
.
<EOS>
Afternoon
came
,
and
I
thought
all
was
over
.
<EOS>
My
heart
trembled
in
its
place
.
<EOS>
My
blood
was
troubled
in
its
current
.
<EOS>
I
was
quite
sick
,
and
hardly
knew
how
to
keep
at
my
post
 
or
do
my
work
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
little
world
round
me
plodded
on
indifferent
;
all
seemed
jocund
,
free
of
care
,
or
fear
,
or
thought
:
the
very
pupils
who
,
seven
days
since
,
had
wept
hysterically
at
a
startling
piece
of
news
,
appeared
quite
to
have
forgotten
the
news
,
its
import
,
and
their
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
A
little
before
five
o'clock
,
the
hour
of
dismissal
,
Madame
Beck
sent
for
me
to
her
chamber
,
to
read
over
and
translate
some
English
letter
she
had
received
,
and
to
write
for
her
the
answer
.
<EOS>
Before
settling
to
this
work
,
I
observed
that
she
softly
closed
the
two
doors
of
her
chamber
;
she
even
shut
and
fastened
the
casement
,
though
it
was
a
hot
day
,
and
free
circulation
of
air
was
usually
regarded
by
her
as
indispensable
.
<EOS>
Why
this
precaution
?
<EOS>
A
keen
suspicion
,
an
almost
fierce
distrust
,
suggested
such
question
.
<EOS>
Did
she
want
to
exclude
sound
?
<EOS>
what
sound
?
  
<EOS>
I
listened
as
I
had
never
listened
before
;
I
listened
like
the
evening
and
winter
-
wolf
,
snuffing
the
snow
,
scenting
prey
,
and
hearing
far
off
the
traveller
's
tramp
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
could
both
listen
and
write
.
<EOS>
About
the
middle
of
the
letter
I
heard
 
what
checked
my
pen
 
a
tread
in
the
vestibule
.
<EOS>
No
door
-
bell
had
rung
;
Rosine
 
<EOS>
acting
doubtless
by
orders
 
had
anticipated
such
réveillée
.
<EOS>
Madame
saw
me
halt
.
<EOS>
She
coughed
,
made
a
bustle
,
spoke
louder
.
<EOS>
The
tread
had
passed
on
to
the
classes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Proceed
,
"
said
Madame
;
but
my
hand
was
fettered
,
my
ear
enchained
<EOS>
,
my
thoughts
were
carried
off
captive
.
  
<EOS>
The
classes
formed
another
building
;
the
hall
parted
them
from
the
dwelling
-
house
:
despite
distance
and
partition
,
I
heard
the
sudden
stir
of
numbers
,
a
whole
division
rising
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
putting
away
work
,
"
said
Madame
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
indeed
the
hour
to
put
away
work
,
but
why
that
sudden
hush
 
that
instant
quell
of
the
tumult
?
  
<EOS>
"
Wait
,
Madame
 
<EOS>
I
will
see
what
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
I
put
down
my
pen
and
left
her
.
<EOS>
Left
her
?
<EOS>
No
:
<EOS>
she
would
not
be
left
:
powerless
to
detain
me
,
she
rose
and
followed
,
close
as
my
shadow
.
<EOS>
I
turned
on
the
last
step
of
the
stair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
coming
,
too
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
she
;
meeting
my
glance
with
a
peculiar
aspect
 
a
look
,
clouded
,
yet
resolute
.
  
<EOS>
We
proceeded
then
,
not
together
,
but
she
walked
in
my
steps
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
come
.
<EOS>
Entering
the
first
classe
,
I
saw
him
.
<EOS>
There
,
once
more
appeared
the
form
most
familiar
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
they
had
tried
to
keep
him
away
,
but
he
was
come
.
  
<EOS>
The
girls
stood
in
a
semicircle
;
he
was
passing
round
,
giving
his
farewells
,
pressing
each
hand
,
touching
with
his
lips
each
cheek
.
<EOS>
This
last
ceremony
,
foreign
custom
permitted
at
such
a
parting
 
so
solemn
,
to
last
so
long
.
  
<EOS>
I
felt
it
hard
that
Madame
Beck
should
dog
me
thus
;
following
and
watching
me
close
;
my
neck
and
shoulder
shrunk
in
fever
under
her
breath
;
I
became
terribly
goaded
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
approaching
;
the
semicircle
was
almost
travelled
round
;
he
came
to
the
last
pupil
;
he
turned
.
<EOS>
But
Madame
was
before
me
;
she
had
stepped
out
suddenly
;
she
seemed
to
magnify
her
proportions
and
amplify
her
drapery
;
she
eclipsed
me
;
I
was
hid
.
<EOS>
She
knew
my
weakness
and
deficiency
;
she
could
calculate
the
degree
of
moral
paralysis
 
the
total
default
of
self
-
assertion
 
with
which
,
in
a
crisis
,
I
could
be
struck
.
<EOS>
She
hastened
to
her
kinsman
,
she
broke
upon
him
volubly
,
she
mastered
his
attention
,
she
hurried
him
to
the
door
 
the
glass
-
door
opening
on
the
garden
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
looked
round
;
<EOS>
could
I
but
have
caught
his
eye
,
courage
,
I
think
,
would
have
rushed
in
to
aid
feeling
,
and
there
would
have
been
a
charge
,
and
,
perhaps
,
a
rescue
;
but
already
the
room
was
all
confusion
,
the
semicircle
broken
into
groups
,
my
figure
was
lost
among
thirty
more
conspicuous
.
<EOS>
Madame
had
her
will
;
yes
,
she
got
him
away
,
and
he
had
not
seen
me
;
he
thought
me
absent
.
<EOS>
Five
o'clock
struck
,
the
loud
dismissal
-
bell
rang
,
the
school
separated
,
the
room
emptied
.
  
<EOS>
There
seems
,
to
my
memory
,
an
entire
darkness
and
distraction
in
some
certain
minutes
I
then
passed
alone
 
a
grief
inexpressible
over
a
loss
unendurable
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
What
_
should
I
do
;
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
what
_
should
I
do
;
when
all
my
life
's
hope
was
thus
torn
by
the
roots
out
of
my
riven
,
outraged
heart
?
  
<EOS>
What
I
_
should
_
have
done
,
I
know
not
,
when
a
little
child
 
the
least
child
in
the
school
 
broke
with
its
simplicity
and
its
unconsciousness
into
the
raging
yet
silent
centre
of
that
inward
conflict
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
,
"
lisped
the
treble
voice
,
"
I
am
to
give
you
that
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
said
I
was
to
seek
you
all
over
the
house
,
from
the
grenier
to
the
cellar
,
and
when
I
found
you
,
to
give
you
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
the
child
delivered
a
note
;
the
little
dove
dropped
on
my
knee
,
its
olive
leaf
plucked
off
.
<EOS>
I
found
neither
address
nor
name
,
only
these
words
:
    
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
my
intention
to
take
leave
of
you
when
I
said
good
-
by
to
the
rest
,
but
I
hoped
to
see
you
in
classe
.
<EOS>
I
was
disappointed
.
<EOS>
The
interview
is
deferred
.
<EOS>
Be
ready
for
me
.
<EOS>
Ere
I
sail
,
I
must
see
you
at
leisure
,
and
speak
with
you
at
length
.
<EOS>
Be
ready
;
my
moments
are
numbered
,
and
,
just
now
,
monopolized
;
besides
,
I
have
a
private
business
on
hand
which
I
will
not
share
with
any
,
nor
communicate
 
even
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
PAUL
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Be
ready
?
"
<EOS>
Then
it
must
be
this
evening
:
<EOS>
was
he
not
to
go
on
the
morrow
?
<EOS>
Yes
;
of
that
point
I
was
certain
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
the
date
of
his
vessel
's
departure
advertised
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
would
be
ready
,
but
could
that
longed
-
for
meeting
really
be
achieved
?
<EOS>
the
time
was
so
short
,
the
schemers
seemed
so
watchful
,
so
active
,
so
hostile
;
the
way
of
access
appeared
strait
as
a
gully
,
deep
as
a
chasm
 
Apollyon
straddled
across
it
,
breathing
flames
.
<EOS>
Could
my
Greatheart
overcome
?
<EOS>
Could
my
guide
reach
me
?
  
<EOS>
Who
might
tell
?
<EOS>
Yet
I
began
to
take
some
courage
,
some
comfort
;
it
seemed
to
me
that
I
felt
a
pulse
of
his
heart
beating
yet
true
to
the
whole
throb
of
mine
.
  
<EOS>
I
waited
my
champion
.
<EOS>
Apollyon
came
trailing
his
Hell
behind
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
if
Eternity
held
torment
,
its
form
would
not
be
fiery
rack
,
nor
its
nature
despair
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
on
a
certain
day
amongst
those
days
which
never
dawned
,
and
will
not
set
,
an
angel
entered
Hades
 
stood
,
shone
,
smiled
,
delivered
a
prophecy
of
conditional
pardon
,
kindled
a
doubtful
hope
of
bliss
to
come
,
not
now
,
but
at
a
day
and
hour
unlooked
for
,
revealed
in
his
own
glory
and
grandeur
the
height
and
compass
of
his
promise
:
spoke
thus
 
then
towering
,
became
a
star
,
and
vanished
into
his
own
Heaven
.
<EOS>
His
legacy
was
suspense
 
a
worse
boon
than
despair
.
  
<EOS>
All
that
evening
I
waited
,
trusting
in
the
dove
-
sent
olive
-
leaf
,
yet
in
the
midst
of
my
trust
,
terribly
fearing
.
<EOS>
My
fear
pressed
heavy
.
<EOS>
Cold
and
peculiar
,
I
knew
it
for
the
partner
of
a
rarely
-
belied
presentiment
.
<EOS>
The
first
hours
seemed
long
and
slow
;
in
spirit
I
clung
to
the
flying
skirts
of
the
last
.
<EOS>
They
passed
like
drift
cloud
 
like
the
wrack
scudding
before
a
storm
.
  
<EOS>
They
passed
.
<EOS>
All
the
long
,
hot
summer
day
burned
away
like
a
Yule
-
log
;
the
crimson
of
its
close
perished
;
I
was
left
bent
among
the
cool
blue
shades
,
over
the
pale
and
ashen
gleams
of
its
night
.
  
<EOS>
Prayers
were
over
;
it
was
bed
-
time
;
my
co
-
inmates
were
all
retired
.
<EOS>
I
still
remained
in
the
gloomy
first
classe
,
forgetting
,
or
at
least
disregarding
,
<EOS>
rules
<EOS>
I
had
never
forgotten
or
disregarded
before
.
  
<EOS>
How
long
I
paced
that
classe
I
can
not
tell
;
I
must
have
been
afoot
many
hours
;
mechanically
had
I
moved
aside
benches
and
desks
,
and
had
made
for
myself
a
path
down
its
length
.
<EOS>
There
I
walked
,
and
there
,
<EOS>
when
certain
that
the
whole
household
were
abed
,
and
quite
out
of
hearing
 
there
,
I
at
last
wept
.
<EOS>
Reliant
on
Night
,
confiding
in
Solitude
,
I
kept
my
tears
sealed
<EOS>
,
my
sobs
chained
,
no
longer
;
they
heaved
my
heart
;
they
tore
their
way
.
<EOS>
In
this
house
,
what
grief
could
be
sacred
?
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
eleven
o'clock
 
a
very
late
hour
in
the
Rue
Fossette
 
<EOS>
the
door
unclosed
,
quietly
but
not
stealthily
;
a
lamp
's
flame
invaded
the
moonlight
;
Madame
Beck
entered
,
with
the
same
composed
air
,
as
if
coming
on
an
ordinary
occasion
,
at
an
ordinary
season
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
at
once
addressing
me
,
she
went
to
her
desk
,
took
her
keys
,
and
seemed
to
seek
something
<EOS>
:
she
loitered
over
this
feigned
search
long
,
too
long
.
<EOS>
She
was
calm
,
too
calm
;
my
mood
scarce
endured
the
pretence
;
driven
beyond
common
range
,
two
hours
since
I
had
left
behind
me
wonted
respects
and
fears
.
<EOS>
Led
by
a
touch
,
and
ruled
by
a
word
,
under
usual
circumstances
,
no
yoke
could
now
be
borne
 
no
curb
obeyed
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
more
than
time
for
retirement
,
"
said
Madame
;
"
the
rule
of
the
house
has
already
been
transgressed
too
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Madame
met
no
answer
:
<EOS>
I
did
not
check
my
walk
;
when
she
came
in
my
way
,
I
put
her
out
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
persuade
you
to
calm
,
Meess
;
let
me
lead
you
to
your
chamber
,
"
said
she
,
trying
to
speak
softly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
;
"
neither
you
nor
another
shall
persuade
or
lead
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
bed
shall
be
warmed
.
<EOS>
Goton
is
sitting
up
still
.
<EOS>
She
shall
make
you
comfortable
:
she
shall
give
you
a
sedative
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madame
,
"
I
broke
out
,
"
you
are
a
sensualist
.
<EOS>
Under
all
your
serenity
,
your
peace
,
and
your
decorum
,
you
are
an
undenied
sensualist
.
<EOS>
Make
your
own
bed
warm
and
soft
;
take
sedatives
and
meats
,
and
drinks
spiced
and
sweet
,
as
much
as
you
will
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
sorrow
or
disappointment
 
and
,
perhaps
,
you
have
 
nay
,
I
_
know
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
you
have
 
<EOS>
seek
your
own
palliatives
,
in
your
own
chosen
resources
.
<EOS>
Leave
me
,
however
.
<EOS>
_
Leave
me
_
,
I
say
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
send
another
to
watch
you
,
Meess
:
I
must
send
Goton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
forbid
it
.
<EOS>
Let
me
alone
.
<EOS>
Keep
your
hand
off
me
,
and
my
life
,
and
my
troubles
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Madame
!
<EOS>
in
_
your
_
hand
there
is
both
chill
and
poison
.
<EOS>
You
envenom
and
you
paralyze
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
done
,
Meess
?
<EOS>
You
must
not
marry
Paul
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dog
in
the
manger
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
:
for
I
knew
she
secretly
wanted
him
,
and
had
always
wanted
him
.
<EOS>
She
called
him
"
insupportable
:
"
she
railed
at
him
for
a
"
dévot
:
"
she
did
not
love
,
but
she
wanted
to
marry
,
that
she
might
bind
him
to
her
interest
.
<EOS>
Deep
into
some
of
Madame
's
secrets
I
had
entered
 
I
know
<EOS>
not
how
:
by
an
intuition
or
an
inspiration
which
came
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
whence
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
living
with
her
too
,
I
had
slowly
learned
,
that
,
unless
with
an
inferior
,
she
must
ever
be
a
rival
.
<EOS>
She
was
_
<EOS>
my
_
rival
,
heart
and
soul
,
though
secretly
,
under
the
smoothest
bearing
,
and
utterly
unknown
to
all
save
her
and
myself
.
  
<EOS>
Two
minutes
I
stood
over
Madame
,
feeling
that
the
whole
woman
was
in
my
power
,
because
in
some
moods
,
such
as
the
present
 
in
some
stimulated
states
of
perception
,
like
that
of
this
instant
 
<EOS>
her
habitual
disguise
,
her
mask
and
her
domino
,
were
to
me
a
mere
network
reticulated
with
holes
;
and
I
saw
underneath
a
being
heartless
,
self
-
indulgent
,
and
ignoble
.
<EOS>
She
quietly
retreated
from
me
:
meek
and
self
-
possessed
,
though
very
uneasy
,
she
said
,
"
If
I
would
not
be
persuaded
to
take
rest
,
she
must
reluctantly
leave
me
.
"
<EOS>
Which
she
did
incontinent
,
perhaps
even
more
glad
to
get
away
,
than
I
was
to
see
her
vanish
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
sole
flash
-
eliciting
,
truth
-
extorting
,
rencontre
which
ever
occurred
between
me
and
Madame
Beck
:
this
short
night
-
scene
was
never
repeated
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
one
whit
change
her
manner
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
she
revenged
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
she
hated
me
the
worse
for
my
fell
candour
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
bucklered
herself
with
the
secret
philosophy
of
her
strong
mind
,
and
resolved
to
forget
what
it
irked
her
to
remember
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
to
the
end
of
our
mutual
lives
there
occurred
no
repetition
of
,
no
allusion
to
,
that
fiery
passage
.
  
<EOS>
That
night
passed
:
all
nights
 
even
the
starless
night
before
dissolution
 
must
wear
away
.
<EOS>
About
six
o'clock
,
the
hour
which
called
up
the
household
,
I
went
out
to
the
court
,
and
washed
my
face
in
its
cold
,
fresh
well
-
water
.
<EOS>
Entering
by
the
carré
,
a
piece
of
mirror
-
glass
,
set
in
an
oaken
cabinet
,
repeated
my
image
.
<EOS>
It
said
I
was
changed
:
my
cheeks
and
lips
were
sodden
white
,
my
eyes
were
glassy
,
and
my
eyelids
swollen
and
purple
.
  
<EOS>
On
rejoining
my
companions
,
I
knew
they
all
looked
at
me
 
<EOS>
my
heart
seemed
discovered
to
them
:
I
believed
myself
self
-
betrayed
.
<EOS>
Hideously
certain
did
it
seem
that
the
very
youngest
of
the
school
must
guess
why
and
for
whom
I
despaired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Isabelle
,
"
the
child
whom
I
had
once
nursed
in
sickness
,
approached
me
.
<EOS>
Would
she
,
too
,
mock
me
!
  
<EOS>
"
Que
vous
êtes
pâle
!
<EOS>
Vous
êtes
donc
bien
malade
,
Mademoiselle
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
putting
her
finger
in
her
mouth
,
and
staring
with
a
wistful
stupidity
which
at
the
moment
seemed
to
me
more
beautiful
than
the
keenest
intelligence
.
  
<EOS>
Isabelle
did
not
long
stand
alone
in
the
recommendation
of
ignorance
:
before
the
day
was
over
,
I
gathered
cause
of
gratitude
towards
the
whole
blind
household
.
<EOS>
The
multitude
have
something
else
to
do
than
to
read
hearts
and
interpret
dark
sayings
.
<EOS>
Who
wills
,
may
keep
his
own
counsel
 
be
his
own
secret
's
sovereign
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
that
day
,
proof
met
me
on
proof
,
not
only
that
the
cause
of
my
present
sorrow
was
unguessed
,
but
that
my
whole
inner
life
for
the
last
six
months
,
was
still
mine
only
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
known
 
<EOS>
it
had
not
been
noted
 
that
I
held
in
peculiar
value
one
life
among
all
lives
.
<EOS>
Gossip
had
passed
me
by
;
curiosity
had
looked
me
over
;
both
subtle
influences
,
hovering
always
round
,
had
never
become
centred
upon
me
.
<EOS>
A
given
organization
may
live
in
a
full
fever
-
hospital
,
and
escape
typhus
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
had
come
and
gone
:
I
had
been
taught
and
sought
;
in
season
and
out
of
season
he
had
called
me
,
and
I
had
obeyed
him
:
"
M.
Paul
wants
Miss
Lucy
"
 
"
Miss
Lucy
is
with
M.
Paul
"
 
<EOS>
such
had
been
the
perpetual
bulletin
;
and
nobody
commented
,
far
less
condemned
.
<EOS>
Nobody
hinted
,
nobody
jested
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
read
the
riddle
:
none
else
resolved
it
.
<EOS>
What
I
now
suffered
was
called
illness
 
a
headache
:
I
accepted
the
baptism
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
bodily
illness
was
ever
like
this
pain
?
<EOS>
This
certainty
that
he
was
gone
without
a
farewell
 
this
cruel
conviction
that
fate
and
pursuing
furies
 
a
woman
's
envy
and
a
priest
's
bigotry
 
would
suffer
me
to
see
him
no
more
?
<EOS>
What
wonder
that
the
second
evening
found
me
like
the
first
 
untamed
,
tortured
,
again
pacing
a
solitary
room
in
an
unalterable
passion
of
silent
desolation
?
  
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
did
not
herself
summon
me
to
bed
that
night
 
she
did
not
come
near
me
:
she
sent
Ginevra
Fanshawe
 
a
more
efficient
agent
for
the
purpose
she
could
not
have
employed
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
's
first
words
 
<EOS>
"
Is
your
headache
very
bad
to
-
night
?
"
<EOS>
(
for
Ginevra
,
like
the
rest
,
thought
I
had
a
headache
 
an
intolerable
headache
which
made
me
frightfully
white
in
the
face
,
and
insanely
restless
in
the
foot
)
 
<EOS>
her
first
words
,
I
say
,
inspired
the
impulse
to
flee
anywhere
,
so
that
it
were
only
out
of
reach
.
<EOS>
And
soon
,
what
followed
 
plaints
about
her
own
headaches
 
completed
the
business
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
Presently
I
was
in
my
bed
 
<EOS>
my
miserable
bed
 
haunted
with
quick
scorpions
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
been
laid
down
five
minutes
,
when
another
emissary
arrived
:
Goton
came
,
bringing
me
something
to
drink
.
<EOS>
I
was
consumed
with
thirst
 
<EOS>
I
drank
eagerly
;
the
beverage
was
sweet
,
but
I
tasted
a
drug
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madame
says
it
will
make
you
sleep
,
chou
-
chou
,
"
said
Goton
,
as
she
received
back
the
emptied
cup
.
  
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
the
sedative
had
been
administered
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
they
had
given
me
a
strong
opiate
.
<EOS>
I
was
to
be
held
quiet
for
one
night
.
  
<EOS>
The
household
came
to
bed
,
the
night
-
light
was
lit
,
the
dormitory
hushed
.
<EOS>
Sleep
soon
reigned
:
over
those
pillows
,
sleep
won
an
easy
supremacy
:
contented
sovereign
over
heads
and
hearts
which
did
not
ache
 
<EOS>
he
passed
by
the
unquiet
.
  
<EOS>
The
drug
wrought
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
Madame
had
overcharged
or
under
-
charged
the
dose
;
its
result
was
not
that
she
intended
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
stupor
,
came
excitement
.
<EOS>
I
became
alive
to
new
thought
 
to
reverie
peculiar
in
colouring
.
<EOS>
A
gathering
call
ran
among
the
faculties
,
their
bugles
sang
,
their
trumpets
rang
an
untimely
summons
.
<EOS>
Imagination
was
roused
from
her
rest
,
and
she
came
forth
impetuous
and
venturous
.
<EOS>
With
scorn
she
looked
on
Matter
,
her
mate
 
"
Rise
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Sluggard
!
<EOS>
this
night
I
will
have
_
my
_
will
;
nor
shalt
thou
prevail
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
forth
and
view
the
night
!
"
<EOS>
was
her
cry
;
and
when
I
lifted
the
heavy
blind
from
the
casement
close
at
hand
 
with
her
own
royal
gesture
,
she
showed
me
a
moon
supreme
,
in
an
element
deep
and
splendid
.
  
<EOS>
To
my
gasping
senses
she
made
the
glimmering
gloom
,
the
narrow
limits
,
the
oppressive
heat
of
the
dormitory
,
intolerable
.
<EOS>
She
lured
me
to
leave
this
den
and
follow
her
forth
into
dew
,
coolness
,
and
glory
.
  
<EOS>
She
brought
upon
me
a
strange
vision
of
Villette
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
Especially
she
showed
the
park
,
the
summer
-
park
,
with
its
long
alleys
all
silent
,
lone
and
safe
;
among
these
lay
a
huge
stone
basin
 
<EOS>
that
basin
I
knew
,
and
beside
which
I
had
often
stood
 
deep
-
set
in
the
tree
-
shadows
,
brimming
with
cool
water
,
clear
,
with
a
green
,
leafy
,
rushy
bed
.
<EOS>
What
of
all
this
?
<EOS>
The
park
-
gates
were
shut
up
,
locked
,
sentinelled
:
the
place
could
not
be
entered
.
  
<EOS>
Could
it
not
?
<EOS>
A
point
worth
considering
;
and
while
revolving
it
,
I
mechanically
dressed
.
<EOS>
Utterly
incapable
of
sleeping
or
lying
still
 
excited
from
head
to
foot
 
<EOS>
what
could
I
do
better
than
dress
?
  
<EOS>
The
gates
were
locked
,
soldiers
set
before
them
:
was
there
,
then
,
no
admission
to
the
park
?
  
<EOS>
The
other
day
,
in
walking
past
,
I
had
seen
,
without
then
attending
to
the
circumstance
,
a
gap
in
the
paling
 
one
stake
broken
down
:
<EOS>
I
now
saw
this
gap
again
in
recollection
 
saw
it
very
plainly
 
<EOS>
the
narrow
,
irregular
aperture
visible
between
the
stems
of
the
lindens
,
planted
orderly
as
a
colonnade
.
<EOS>
A
man
could
not
have
made
his
way
through
that
aperture
,
nor
could
a
stout
woman
,
perhaps
not
Madame
Beck
;
but
I
thought
I
might
:
<EOS>
I
fancied
I
should
like
to
try
,
and
once
within
,
at
this
hour
the
whole
park
would
be
mine
 
<EOS>
the
moonlight
,
midnight
park
!
  
<EOS>
How
soundly
the
dormitory
slept
!
<EOS>
What
deep
slumbers
!
<EOS>
What
quiet
breathing
!
<EOS>
How
very
still
the
whole
large
house
!
<EOS>
What
was
the
time
?
<EOS>
I
felt
restless
to
know
.
<EOS>
There
stood
a
clock
in
the
classe
below
:
<EOS>
what
hindered
me
from
venturing
down
to
consult
it
?
<EOS>
By
such
a
moon
,
its
large
white
face
and
jet
black
figures
must
be
vividly
distinct
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
hindrance
to
this
step
,
there
offered
not
so
much
as
a
creaking
hinge
or
a
clicking
latch
.
<EOS>
On
these
hot
July
nights
,
close
air
could
not
be
tolerated
,
and
the
chamber
-
door
stood
wide
open
.
<EOS>
Will
the
dormitory
-
planks
sustain
my
tread
untraitorous
?
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
know
wherever
a
board
is
loose
,
and
will
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
The
oak
staircase
creaks
somewhat
as
I
descend
,
but
not
much
:
 
<EOS>
I
am
in
the
carré
.
  
<EOS>
The
great
classe
-
doors
are
close
shut
:
they
are
bolted
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
the
entrance
to
the
corridor
stands
open
.
<EOS>
The
classes
seem
to
my
thought
,
great
dreary
jails
,
buried
far
back
beyond
thoroughfares
,
and
for
me
,
filled
with
spectral
and
intolerable
Memories
,
laid
miserable
amongst
their
straw
and
their
manacles
.
<EOS>
The
corridor
offers
a
cheerful
vista
,
leading
to
the
high
vestibule
which
opens
direct
upon
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
the
clock
strikes
.
<EOS>
Ghostly
deep
as
is
the
stillness
of
this
convent
,
it
is
only
eleven
.
<EOS>
While
my
ear
follows
to
silence
the
hum
of
the
last
stroke
,
I
catch
faintly
from
the
built
-
out
capital
,
a
sound
like
bells
or
like
a
band
 
a
sound
where
sweetness
,
where
victory
,
where
mourning
blend
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
to
approach
this
music
nearer
,
to
listen
to
it
alone
by
the
rushy
basin
!
<EOS>
Let
me
go
 
<EOS>
oh
,
let
me
go
!
<EOS>
What
hinders
,
what
does
not
aid
freedom
?
  
<EOS>
There
,
in
the
corridor
,
hangs
my
garden
-
costume
,
my
large
hat
,
my
shawl
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
lock
on
the
huge
,
heavy
,
porte
-
cochère
;
there
is
no
key
to
seek
:
it
fastens
with
a
sort
of
spring
-
bolt
,
not
to
be
opened
from
the
outside
,
but
which
,
from
within
,
may
be
noiselessly
withdrawn
.
<EOS>
Can
I
manage
it
?
<EOS>
It
yields
to
my
hand
,
yields
with
propitious
facility
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
as
that
portal
seems
almost
spontaneously
to
unclose
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
as
I
cross
the
threshold
and
step
on
the
paved
street
,
wonder
at
the
strange
ease
with
which
this
prison
has
been
forced
.
<EOS>
It
seems
as
if
I
had
been
pioneered
invisibly
,
as
if
some
dissolving
force
had
gone
before
me
:
for
myself
,
I
have
scarce
made
an
effort
.
  
<EOS>
Quiet
Rue
Fossette
!
<EOS>
I
find
on
this
pavement
that
wanderer
-
wooing
summer
night
of
which
I
mused
<EOS>
;
I
see
its
moon
over
me
;
I
feel
its
dew
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
But
here
I
can
not
stay
;
I
am
still
too
near
old
haunts
:
so
close
under
the
dungeon
,
I
can
hear
the
prisoners
moan
.
<EOS>
This
solemn
peace
is
not
what
I
seek
,
it
is
not
what
I
can
bear
:
to
me
the
face
of
that
sky
bears
the
aspect
of
a
world
's
death
.
<EOS>
The
park
also
will
be
calm
 
<EOS>
I
know
,
a
mortal
serenity
prevails
everywhere
 
yet
let
me
seek
the
park
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
a
route
well
known
,
and
went
up
towards
the
palatial
and
royal
Haute
-
Ville
;
thence
the
music
I
had
heard
certainly
floated
;
it
was
hushed
now
,
but
it
might
re
-
waken
.
<EOS>
I
went
on
:
<EOS>
neither
band
nor
bell
music
came
to
meet
me
;
another
sound
replaced
it
,
a
sound
like
a
strong
tide
,
a
great
flow
,
deepening
as
I
proceeded
.
<EOS>
Light
broke
,
movement
gathered
,
<EOS>
chimes
pealed
 
to
what
was
I
coming
?
<EOS>
Entering
on
the
level
of
a
Grande
Place
,
I
found
myself
,
with
the
suddenness
of
magic
,
plunged
amidst
a
gay
,
living
,
joyous
crowd
.
  
<EOS>
Villette
is
one
blaze
,
one
broad
illumination
;
the
whole
world
seems
abroad
;
moonlight
and
heaven
are
banished
:
the
town
,
by
her
own
flambeaux
,
beholds
her
own
splendour
 
<EOS>
gay
dresses
,
grand
equipages
,
fine
horses
and
gallant
riders
throng
the
bright
streets
.
<EOS>
I
see
even
scores
of
masks
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
strange
scene
,
stranger
than
dreams
.
<EOS>
But
where
is
the
park
?
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
be
near
it
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
this
glare
the
park
must
be
shadowy
and
calm
 
_
there
_
,
at
least
,
are
neither
torches
,
lamps
,
nor
crowd
?
  
<EOS>
I
was
asking
this
question
when
an
open
carriage
passed
me
filled
with
known
faces
.
<EOS>
Through
the
deep
throng
it
could
pass
but
slowly
;
the
spirited
horses
fretted
in
their
curbed
ardour
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
occupants
of
that
carriage
well
:
me
they
could
not
see
,
or
,
at
least
,
not
know
,
folded
close
in
my
large
shawl
,
screened
with
my
straw
hat
(
in
that
motley
crowd
no
dress
was
noticeably
strange
)
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
Count
de
Bassompierre
;
I
saw
my
godmother
,
handsomely
apparelled
,
comely
and
cheerful
;
I
saw
,
too
,
Paulina
Mary
,
compassed
with
the
triple
halo
of
her
beauty
,
her
youth
,
and
her
happiness
.
<EOS>
In
looking
on
her
countenance
of
joy
,
and
eyes
of
festal
light
,
one
scarce
remembered
to
note
the
gala
elegance
of
what
she
wore
;
I
know
only
that
the
drapery
floating
about
her
was
all
white
and
light
and
bridal
;
seated
opposite
to
her
<EOS>
I
saw
Graham
Bretton
;
it
was
in
looking
up
at
him
<EOS>
her
aspect
had
caught
its
lustre
 
<EOS>
the
light
repeated
in
_
<EOS>
her
_
eyes
beamed
first
out
of
his
.
  
<EOS>
It
gave
me
strange
pleasure
to
follow
these
friends
viewlessly
,
and
I
_
did
_
follow
them
,
as
I
thought
,
to
the
park
.
<EOS>
I
watched
them
<EOS>
alight
(
carriages
were
inadmissible
)
amidst
new
and
unanticipated
splendours
.
<EOS>
Lo
!
<EOS>
the
iron
gateway
,
between
the
stone
columns
,
was
spanned
by
a
flaming
arch
built
of
massed
stars
;
and
,
following
them
cautiously
beneath
that
arch
,
where
were
they
,
and
where
was
I
?
  
<EOS>
In
a
land
of
enchantment
,
a
garden
most
gorgeous
,
a
plain
sprinkled
with
coloured
meteors
,
a
forest
with
sparks
of
purple
and
ruby
and
golden
fire
gemming
the
foliage
;
a
region
,
not
of
trees
and
shadow
,
but
of
strangest
architectural
wealth
 
of
altar
and
of
temple
,
of
pyramid
,
obelisk
,
and
sphinx
:
incredible
to
say
,
the
wonders
and
the
symbols
of
Egypt
teemed
throughout
the
park
of
Villette
.
  
<EOS>
No
matter
that
in
five
minutes
the
secret
was
mine
 
the
key
of
the
mystery
picked
up
,
and
its
illusion
unveiled
 
no
matter
that
I
quickly
recognised
the
material
of
these
solemn
fragments
 
the
timber
,
the
paint
,
and
the
pasteboard
 
these
inevitable
discoveries
failed
to
quite
destroy
the
charm
,
or
undermine
the
marvel
of
that
night
.
<EOS>
No
matter
that
I
now
seized
the
explanation
of
the
whole
great
fête
 
<EOS>
a
fête
of
which
the
conventual
Rue
Fossette
had
not
tasted
,
though
it
had
opened
at
dawn
that
morning
,
and
was
still
in
full
vigour
near
midnight
.
  
<EOS>
In
past
days
there
had
been
,
said
history
,
an
awful
crisis
in
the
fate
of
Labassecour
,
involving
I
know
<EOS>
not
what
peril
to
the
rights
and
liberties
of
her
gallant
citizens
.
<EOS>
Rumours
of
wars
there
had
been
,
if
not
wars
themselves
;
a
kind
of
struggling
in
the
streets
 
<EOS>
a
bustle
 
<EOS>
a
running
to
and
fro
,
some
rearing
of
barricades
,
some
burgher
-
rioting
,
<EOS>
some
calling
out
of
troops
,
much
interchange
of
brickbats
,
and
even
a
little
of
shot
.
<EOS>
Tradition
held
that
patriots
had
fallen
:
in
the
old
Basse
-
Ville
was
shown
an
enclosure
,
solemnly
built
in
and
set
apart
,
holding
,
it
was
said
,
the
sacred
bones
of
martyrs
.
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
a
certain
day
in
the
year
was
still
kept
as
a
festival
in
honour
of
the
said
patriots
and
martyrs
of
somewhat
apocryphal
memory
 
<EOS>
the
morning
being
given
to
a
solemn
Te
Deum
in
St.
Jean
Baptiste
,
the
evening
devoted
to
spectacles
,
decorations
,
and
illuminations
,
such
as
these
I
now
saw
.
  
<EOS>
While
looking
up
at
the
image
of
a
white
ibis
,
fixed
on
a
column
 
while
fathoming
the
deep
,
torch
-
lit
perspective
of
an
avenue
,
at
the
close
of
which
was
couched
a
sphinx
 
<EOS>
I
lost
sight
of
the
party
which
,
from
the
middle
of
the
great
square
,
I
had
followed
 
or
,
rather
,
they
vanished
like
a
group
of
apparitions
.
<EOS>
On
this
whole
scene
was
impressed
a
dream
-
like
character
:
every
shape
was
wavering
,
every
movement
floating
,
every
voice
echo
-
like
 
half
-
mocking
,
half
-
uncertain
.
<EOS>
Paulina
and
her
friends
being
gone
,
I
scarce
could
avouch
that
I
had
really
seen
them
;
nor
did
I
miss
them
as
guides
through
the
chaos
,
far
less
regret
them
as
protectors
amidst
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
That
festal
night
would
have
been
safe
for
a
very
child
.
<EOS>
Half
the
peasantry
had
come
in
from
the
outlying
environs
of
Villette
,
and
the
decent
burghers
were
all
abroad
and
around
,
dressed
in
their
best
.
<EOS>
My
straw
-
hat
passed
amidst
cap
and
jacket
,
short
petticoat
,
and
long
calico
mantle
,
without
,
perhaps
,
attracting
a
glance
;
I
only
took
the
precaution
to
bind
down
the
broad
leaf
gipsy
-
wise
,
with
a
supplementary
ribbon
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
felt
safe
as
if
masked
.
  
<EOS>
Safe
I
passed
down
the
avenues
 
<EOS>
safe
I
mixed
with
the
crowd
where
it
was
deepest
.
<EOS>
To
be
still
was
not
in
my
power
,
nor
quietly
to
observe
.
<EOS>
I
took
a
revel
of
the
scene
;
I
drank
the
elastic
night
-
air
 
<EOS>
the
swell
of
sound
,
the
dubious
light
,
now
flashing
,
now
fading
.
<EOS>
As
to
Happiness
or
Hope
,
they
and
I
had
shaken
hands
,
but
just
now
 
I
scorned
Despair
.
  
<EOS>
My
vague
aim
,
as
I
went
,
was
to
find
the
stone
-
basin
,
with
its
clear
depth
and
green
lining
:
of
that
coolness
and
verdure
<EOS>
I
thought
,
with
the
passionate
thirst
of
unconscious
fever
.
<EOS>
Amidst
the
glare
,
and
hurry
,
and
throng
,
and
noise
,
I
still
secretly
and
chiefly
longed
to
come
on
that
circular
mirror
of
crystal
,
and
surprise
the
moon
glassing
therein
her
pearly
front
.
  
<EOS>
I
knew
my
route
,
yet
it
seemed
as
if
I
was
hindered
from
pursuing
it
direct
:
now
a
sight
,
and
now
a
sound
,
called
me
aside
,
luring
me
down
this
alley
and
down
that
.
<EOS>
Already
I
saw
the
thick
-
planted
trees
which
framed
this
tremulous
and
rippled
glass
,
when
,
choiring
out
of
a
glade
to
the
right
,
broke
such
a
sound
as
I
thought
might
be
heard
if
Heaven
were
to
open
 
such
a
sound
,
perhaps
,
as
_
was
_
heard
above
the
plain
of
Bethlehem
,
on
the
night
of
glad
tidings
.
  
<EOS>
The
song
,
the
sweet
music
,
rose
afar
,
but
rushing
swiftly
on
fast
-
strengthening
pinions
 
there
swept
through
these
shades
so
full
a
storm
of
harmonies
that
,
had
no
tree
been
near
against
which
to
lean
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
must
have
dropped
.
<EOS>
Voices
were
there
,
it
seemed
to
me
,
unnumbered
;
instruments
varied
and
countless
 
bugle
,
horn
,
and
trumpet
<EOS>
I
knew
.
<EOS>
The
effect
was
as
a
sea
breaking
into
song
with
all
its
waves
.
  
<EOS>
The
swaying
tide
swept
this
way
,
and
then
it
fell
back
,
and
I
followed
its
retreat
.
<EOS>
It
led
me
towards
a
Byzantine
building
 
a
sort
of
kiosk
near
the
park
's
centre
.
<EOS>
Round
about
stood
crowded
thousands
,
gathered
to
a
grand
concert
in
the
open
air
.
<EOS>
What
I
had
heard
was
,
I
think
,
a
wild
Jäger
chorus
;
the
night
,
the
space
,
the
scene
,
and
my
own
mood
,
had
but
enhanced
the
sounds
and
their
impression
.
  
<EOS>
Here
were
assembled
ladies
,
looking
by
this
light
most
beautiful
:
some
of
their
dresses
were
gauzy
,
and
some
had
the
sheen
of
satin
,
the
flowers
and
the
blond
trembled
,
and
the
veils
waved
about
their
decorated
bonnets
,
as
that
host
-
like
chorus
,
with
its
greatly
-
gathering
sound
,
sundered
the
air
above
them
.
<EOS>
Most
of
these
ladies
occupied
the
little
light
park
-
chairs
,
and
behind
and
beside
them
stood
guardian
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
The
outer
ranks
of
the
crowd
were
made
up
of
citizens
,
plebeians
and
police
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
outer
rank
I
took
my
place
.
<EOS>
I
rather
liked
to
find
myself
the
silent
,
unknown
,
consequently
unaccosted
neighbour
of
the
short
petticoat
and
the
sabot
;
and
only
the
distant
gazer
at
the
silk
robe
,
the
velvet
mantle
,
and
the
plumed
chapeau
.
<EOS>
Amidst
so
much
life
and
joy
,
too
,
it
suited
me
to
be
alone
 
quite
alone
.
<EOS>
Having
neither
wish
nor
power
to
force
my
way
through
a
mass
so
close
-
packed
,
my
station
was
on
the
farthest
confines
,
where
,
indeed
,
I
might
hear
,
but
could
see
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
is
not
well
placed
,
"
said
a
voice
at
my
elbow
.
<EOS>
Who
dared
accost
<EOS>
_
me
_
,
a
being
in
a
mood
<EOS>
so
little
social
?
<EOS>
I
turned
,
rather
to
repel
than
to
reply
.
<EOS>
I
saw
a
man
 
a
burgher
 
<EOS>
an
entire
stranger
,
as
I
deemed
him
for
one
moment
,
but
the
next
,
recognised
in
him
a
certain
tradesman
 
<EOS>
a
bookseller
,
whose
shop
furnished
the
Rue
Fossette
with
its
books
and
stationery
;
a
man
notorious
in
our
pensionnat
for
the
excessive
brittleness
of
his
temper
,
and
frequent
snappishness
of
his
manner
,
even
to
us
,
his
principal
customers
:
but
whom
,
for
my
solitary
self
,
I
had
ever
been
disposed
to
like
,
and
had
always
found
civil
,
sometimes
kind
;
once
,
in
aiding
me
about
some
troublesome
little
exchange
of
foreign
money
,
he
had
done
me
a
service
.
<EOS>
He
was
an
intelligent
man
;
under
his
asperity
,
he
was
a
good
-
hearted
man
;
the
thought
had
sometimes
crossed
me
,
that
a
part
of
his
nature
bore
affinity
to
a
part
of
M.
Emanuel
's
(
whom
he
knew
well
,
and
whom
I
had
often
seen
sitting
on
Miret
's
counter
,
turning
over
the
current
month
's
publications
)
;
and
it
was
in
this
affinity
I
read
the
explanation
of
that
conciliatory
feeling
with
which
I
instinctively
regarded
him
.
  
<EOS>
Strange
to
say
,
this
man
knew
me
under
my
straw
-
hat
and
closely
-
folded
shawl
;
and
,
though
I
deprecated
the
effort
,
he
insisted
on
making
a
way
for
me
through
the
crowd
,
and
finding
me
a
better
situation
.
<EOS>
He
carried
his
disinterested
civility
further
;
and
,
from
some
quarter
,
procured
me
a
chair
.
<EOS>
Once
and
again
,
I
have
found
that
the
most
cross
-
grained
are
by
no
means
the
worst
of
mankind
;
nor
the
humblest
in
station
,
the
least
polished
in
feeling
.
<EOS>
This
man
,
in
his
courtesy
,
seemed
to
find
nothing
strange
in
my
being
here
alone
;
only
a
reason
for
extending
to
me
,
as
far
as
he
could
,
a
retiring
,
yet
efficient
attention
.
<EOS>
Having
secured
me
a
place
and
a
seat
,
he
withdrew
without
asking
a
question
,
without
obtruding
a
remark
,
without
adding
a
superfluous
word
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
that
Professor
Emanuel
liked
to
take
his
cigar
and
his
lounge
,
and
to
read
his
feuilleton
in
M.
Miret
's
shop
 
the
two
must
have
suited
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
not
been
seated
five
minutes
,
ere
<EOS>
I
became
aware
that
chance
and
my
worthy
burgher
friend
had
brought
me
once
more
within
view
of
a
familiar
and
domestic
group
.
<EOS>
Right
before
me
sat
the
Brettons
and
de
Bassompierres
.
<EOS>
Within
reach
of
my
hand
 
had
I
chosen
to
extend
it
 
sat
a
figure
like
a
fairy
-
queen
,
whose
array
,
lilies
and
their
leaves
seemed
to
have
suggested
;
<EOS>
whatever
was
not
spotless
white
,
being
forest
-
green
.
<EOS>
My
godmother
,
too
,
sat
so
near
,
that
,
had
I
leaned
forward
,
my
breath
might
have
stirred
the
ribbon
of
her
bonnet
.
<EOS>
They
were
too
near
;
having
been
just
recognised
by
a
comparative
stranger
,
I
felt
uneasy
at
this
close
vicinage
of
intimate
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
It
made
me
quite
start
when
Mrs.
Bretton
,
turning
to
Mr.
Home
,
and
speaking
out
of
a
kind
impulse
of
memory
,
said
,
 
"
I
wonder
what
my
steady
little
Lucy
would
say
to
all
this
if
she
were
here
?
<EOS>
I
wish
we
had
brought
her
,
she
would
have
enjoyed
it
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
she
would
,
so
she
would
,
in
her
grave
sensible
fashion
;
it
is
a
pity
<EOS>
but
we
had
asked
her
,
"
rejoined
the
kind
gentleman
;
and
added
,
"
I
like
to
see
her
so
quietly
pleased
;
so
little
moved
,
yet
so
content
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dear
were
they
both
to
me
,
dear
are
they
to
this
day
in
their
remembered
benevolence
.
<EOS>
Little
knew
they
the
rack
of
pain
which
had
driven
Lucy
almost
into
fever
,
and
brought
her
out
,
guideless
and
reckless
,
urged
and
drugged
to
the
brink
of
frenzy
.
<EOS>
I
had
half
a
mind
to
bend
over
the
elders
'
shoulders
,
and
answer
their
goodness
with
the
thanks
of
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
M.
de
Bassompierre
did
not
well
know
_
me
_
,
but
I
knew
_
him
_
,
and
honoured
and
admired
his
nature
,
with
all
its
plain
sincerity
,
its
warm
affection
,
and
unconscious
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
Possibly
I
might
have
spoken
,
but
just
then
Graham
turned
;
he
turned
with
one
of
his
stately
firm
movements
,
so
different
from
those
,
of
a
sharp
-
tempered
under
-
sized
man
:
there
was
behind
him
a
throng
,
a
hundred
ranks
deep
;
there
were
thousands
to
meet
his
eye
and
divide
its
scrutiny
 
why
then
did
he
concentrate
all
on
me
 
oppressing
me
with
the
whole
force
of
that
full
,
blue
,
steadfast
orb
?
<EOS>
Why
,
if
he
_
<EOS>
would
_
look
,
did
not
one
glance
satisfy
him
?
<EOS>
why
did
he
turn
on
his
chair
,
rest
his
elbow
on
its
back
,
and
study
me
leisurely
?
<EOS>
He
could
not
see
my
face
,
I
held
it
down
;
surely
,
he
_
could
_
not
recognise
me
:
<EOS>
I
stooped
,
I
turned
,
I
_
would
_
not
be
known
.
<EOS>
He
rose
,
by
some
means
he
contrived
to
approach
,
in
two
minutes
he
would
have
had
my
secret
:
my
identity
would
have
been
grasped
between
his
,
never
tyrannous
,
but
always
powerful
hands
.
<EOS>
There
was
but
one
way
to
evade
or
to
check
him
.
<EOS>
I
implied
,
by
a
sort
of
supplicatory
gesture
,
that
it
was
my
prayer
to
be
let
alone
;
after
that
,
had
he
persisted
,
he
would
perhaps
have
seen
the
spectacle
of
Lucy
incensed
:
not
all
that
was
grand
,
or
good
,
or
kind
in
him
(
and
Lucy
felt
the
full
amount
)
<EOS>
should
have
kept
her
quite
tame
,
or
absolutely
inoffensive
and
shadowlike
.
<EOS>
He
looked
,
but
he
desisted
.
<EOS>
He
shook
his
handsome
head
,
but
he
was
mute
.
<EOS>
He
resumed
his
seat
,
nor
did
he
again
turn
or
disturb
me
by
a
glance
,
except
indeed
for
one
single
instant
,
when
a
look
,
rather
solicitous
than
curious
,
stole
my
way
 
speaking
what
somehow
stilled
my
heart
like
"
the
south
-
wind
quieting
the
earth
.
<EOS>
"
Graham
's
thoughts
of
me
were
not
entirely
those
of
a
frozen
indifference
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
I
believe
in
that
goodly
mansion
,
his
heart
,
he
kept
one
little
place
under
the
sky
-
lights
where
Lucy
might
have
entertainment
,
if
she
chose
to
call
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
so
handsome
as
the
chambers
where
he
lodged
his
male
friends
;
it
was
not
like
the
hall
where
he
accommodated
his
philanthropy
,
or
the
library
where
he
treasured
his
science
,
still
less
did
it
resemble
the
pavilion
where
his
marriage
feast
was
splendidly
spread
;
yet
,
gradually
,
by
long
and
equal
kindness
,
he
proved
to
me
that
he
kept
one
little
closet
,
over
the
door
of
which
was
written
"
Lucy
's
Room
.
<EOS>
"
I
kept
a
place
for
him
,
too
 
a
place
of
which
I
never
took
the
measure
,
either
by
rule
or
compass
:
I
think
it
was
like
the
tent
of
Peri
-
Banou
.
<EOS>
All
my
life
long
I
carried
it
folded
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
yet
,
released
from
that
hold
and
constriction
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
but
its
innate
capacity
for
expanse
might
have
magnified
it
into
a
tabernacle
for
a
host
.
  
<EOS>
Forbearing
as
he
was
to
-
night
,
I
could
not
stay
in
this
proximity
;
this
dangerous
place
and
seat
must
be
given
up
:
I
watched
my
opportunity
,
rose
,
and
stole
away
.
<EOS>
He
might
think
,
he
might
even
believe
that
Lucy
was
contained
within
that
shawl
,
and
sheltered
under
that
hat
;
he
never
could
be
certain
,
for
he
did
not
see
my
face
.
  
<EOS>
Surely
the
spirit
of
restlessness
was
by
this
time
appeased
?
<EOS>
Had
I
not
had
enough
of
adventure
?
<EOS>
Did
I
not
begin
to
flag
,
quail
,
and
wish
for
safety
under
a
roof
?
<EOS>
Not
so
.
<EOS>
I
still
loathed
my
bed
in
the
school
dormitory
more
than
words
can
express
:
I
clung
to
whatever
could
distract
thought
.
<EOS>
Somehow
I
felt
,
too
,
that
the
night
's
drama
was
but
begun
,
that
the
prologue
was
scarce
spoken
:
throughout
this
woody
and
turfy
theatre
reigned
a
shadow
of
mystery
;
actors
and
incidents
unlooked
-
for
,
waited
behind
the
scenes
:
I
thought
so
foreboding
told
me
as
much
.
  
<EOS>
Straying
at
random
,
obeying
the
push
of
every
chance
elbow
<EOS>
,
I
was
brought
to
a
quarter
where
trees
planted
in
clusters
,
or
towering
singly
,
broke
up
somewhat
the
dense
packing
of
the
crowd
,
and
gave
it
a
more
scattered
character
.
<EOS>
These
confines
were
far
from
the
music
,
and
somewhat
aloof
even
from
the
lamps
,
but
there
was
sound
enough
to
soothe
,
and
with
that
full
,
high
moon
,
lamps
were
scarce
needed
.
<EOS>
Here
had
chiefly
settled
family
-
groups
,
burgher
-
parents
;
some
of
them
,
late
as
was
the
hour
,
actually
surrounded
by
their
children
,
with
whom
it
had
not
been
thought
advisable
to
venture
into
the
closer
throng
.
  
<EOS>
Three
fine
tall
trees
growing
close
,
almost
twined
stem
within
stem
,
lifted
a
thick
canopy
of
shade
above
a
green
knoll
,
crowned
with
a
seat
 
a
seat
which
might
have
held
several
,
yet
it
seemed
abandoned
to
one
,
the
remaining
members
of
the
fortunate
party
in
possession
of
this
site
standing
dutifully
round
;
yet
,
amongst
this
reverend
circle
was
a
lady
,
holding
by
the
hand
a
little
girl
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
caught
sight
of
this
little
girl
,
she
was
twisting
herself
round
on
her
heel
,
swinging
from
her
conductress
's
hand
,
flinging
herself
from
side
to
side
with
wanton
and
fantastic
gyrations
.
<EOS>
These
perverse
movements
arrested
my
attention
,
they
struck
me
as
of
a
character
fearfully
familiar
.
<EOS>
On
close
inspection
,
no
less
so
appeared
the
child
's
equipment
;
the
lilac
silk
pelisse
,
the
small
swansdown
boa
,
the
white
bonnet
 
the
whole
holiday
toilette
,
in
short
,
was
the
gala
garb
of
a
cherub
but
too
well
known
,
of
that
tadpole
,
Désirée
Beck
 
and
<EOS>
Désirée
Beck
it
was
 
she
,
or
an
imp
in
her
likeness
.
  
<EOS>
I
might
have
taken
this
discovery
as
a
thunder
-
clap
,
but
such
hyperbole
would
have
been
premature
;
discovery
was
destined
to
rise
more
than
one
degree
,
ere
it
reached
its
climax
.
  
<EOS>
On
whose
hand
could
the
amiable
Désirée
swing
thus
selfishly
,
whose
glove
could
she
tear
thus
recklessly
,
whose
arm
thus
strain
with
impunity
,
or
on
the
borders
of
whose
dress
thus
turn
and
trample
insolently
,
if
not
the
hand
,
glove
,
arm
,
and
robe
of
her
lady
-
mother
?
<EOS>
And
there
,
in
an
Indian
shawl
and
a
pale
-
green
crape
bonnet
 
there
,
fresh
,
portly
,
blithe
,
and
pleasant
 
there
stood
Madame
Beck
.
  
<EOS>
Curious
!
<EOS>
I
had
certainly
deemed
Madame
in
her
bed
,
and
Désirée
in
her
crib
,
at
this
blessed
minute
,
sleeping
,
both
of
them
,
the
sleep
of
the
just
,
within
the
sacred
walls
,
amidst
the
profound
seclusion
of
the
Rue
Fossette
.
<EOS>
Most
certainly
also
they
did
not
picture
"
Meess
Lucie
"
otherwise
engaged
;
and
here
we
all
three
were
taking
our
"
ébats
"
in
the
fête
-
blazing
park
at
midnight
!
  
<EOS>
The
fact
was
,
Madame
was
only
acting
according
to
her
quite
justifiable
wo
nt
.
<EOS>
I
remembered
now
I
had
heard
it
said
among
the
teachers
 
though
without
at
the
time
particularly
noticing
the
gossip
 
that
often
,
when
we
thought
Madame
in
her
chamber
,
sleeping
,
she
was
gone
,
full
-
dressed
,
to
take
her
pleasure
at
operas
,
or
plays
,
or
balls
.
<EOS>
Madame
had
no
sort
of
taste
for
a
monastic
life
,
and
took
care
 
largely
,
though
discreetly
 
to
season
her
existence
with
a
relish
of
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
Half
a
dozen
gentlemen
of
her
friends
stood
about
her
.
<EOS>
Amongst
these
,
I
was
not
slow
to
recognise
two
or
three
.
<EOS>
There
was
her
brother
,
M.
Victor
Kint
;
there
was
another
person
,
moustached
and
with
long
hair
 
<EOS>
a
calm
,
taciturn
man
,
but
whose
traits
bore
a
stamp
and
a
semblance
I
could
not
mark
unmoved
.
<EOS>
Amidst
reserve
and
phlegm
,
amidst
contrasts
of
character
and
of
countenance
,
something
there
still
was
which
recalled
a
face
 
mobile
,
fervent
,
feeling
 
a
face
changeable
,
now
clouded
,
and
now
alight
 
a
face
from
my
world
taken
away
,
for
my
eyes
lost
,
but
where
my
best
spring
-
hours
of
life
had
alternated
in
shadow
and
in
glow
;
that
face
,
where
I
had
often
seen
movements
so
near
the
signs
of
genius
 
that
why
there
did
not
shine
fully
out
the
undoubted
fire
,
the
thing
,
the
spirit
,
and
the
secret
itself
 
I
could
never
tell
.
<EOS>
Yes
 
this
Josef
Emanuel
 
<EOS>
this
man
of
peace
 
reminded
me
of
his
ardent
brother
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
Messieurs
Victor
and
Josef
,
I
knew
another
of
this
party
.
<EOS>
This
third
person
stood
behind
and
in
the
shade
,
his
attitude
too
was
stooping
,
yet
his
dress
and
bald
white
head
made
him
the
most
conspicuous
figure
of
the
group
.
<EOS>
He
was
an
ecclesiastic
:
he
was
Père
Silas
.
<EOS>
Do
not
fancy
,
reader
,
that
there
was
any
inconsistency
in
the
priest
's
presence
at
this
fête
.
<EOS>
This
was
not
considered
a
show
of
Vanity
Fair
,
but
a
commemoration
of
patriotic
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
The
Church
patronised
it
,
even
with
ostentation
.
<EOS>
There
were
troops
of
priests
in
the
park
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
Père
Silas
stooped
over
the
seat
with
its
single
occupant
,
the
rustic
bench
and
that
which
sat
upon
it
:
a
strange
mass
<EOS>
it
was
 
bearing
no
shape
,
yet
magnificent
.
<EOS>
You
saw
,
indeed
,
the
outline
of
a
face
,
and
features
,
but
these
were
so
cadaverous
and
so
strangely
placed
,
you
could
almost
have
fancied
a
head
severed
from
its
trunk
,
and
flung
at
random
on
a
pile
of
rich
merchandise
.
<EOS>
The
distant
lamp
-
rays
glanced
on
clear
pendants
,
on
broad
rings
;
neither
the
chasteness
of
moonlight
,
nor
the
distance
of
the
torches
,
could
quite
subdue
the
gorgeous
dyes
of
the
drapery
.
<EOS>
Hail
,
Madame
Walravens
!
<EOS>
I
think
you
looked
more
witch
-
like
than
ever
.
<EOS>
And
presently
the
good
lady
proved
that
she
was
indeed
no
corpse
or
ghost
,
but
a
harsh
and
hardy
old
woman
;
for
,
upon
some
aggravation
in
the
clamorous
petition
of
Désirée
Beck
to
her
mother
,
to
go
to
the
kiosk
and
take
sweetmeats
,
the
hunchback
suddenly
fetched
her
a
resounding
rap
with
her
gold
-
knobbed
cane
.
  
<EOS>
There
,
then
,
were
Madame
Walravens
,
Madame
Beck
,
Père
Silas
 
<EOS>
the
whole
conjuration
,
the
secret
junta
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
them
thus
assembled
did
me
good
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
I
felt
weak
before
them
,
or
abashed
,
or
dismayed
.
<EOS>
They
outnumbered
me
,
and
I
was
worsted
and
under
their
feet
;
but
,
as
yet
,
<EOS>
I
was
not
dead
.
    
<EOS>
OLD
AND
NEW
ACQUAINTANCE
.
  
<EOS>
Fascinated
as
by
a
basilisk
with
three
heads
,
I
could
not
leave
this
clique
;
the
ground
near
them
seemed
to
hold
my
feet
.
<EOS>
The
canopy
of
entwined
trees
held
out
shadow
,
the
night
whispered
a
pledge
of
protection
,
and
an
officious
lamp
flashed
just
one
beam
to
show
me
an
obscure
,
safe
seat
,
and
then
vanished
.
<EOS>
Let
me
now
briefly
tell
the
reader
all
that
,
during
the
past
dark
fortnight
,
I
have
been
silently
gathering
from
Rumour
,
respecting
the
origin
and
the
object
of
M.
Emanuel
's
departure
.
<EOS>
The
tale
is
short
,
and
not
new
:
its
alpha
is
Mammon
,
and
its
omega
Interest
.
  
<EOS>
If
Madame
Walravens
was
hideous
as
a
Hindoo
idol
,
she
seemed
also
to
possess
,
in
the
estimation
of
these
her
votaries
,
an
idol
's
consequence
.
<EOS>
The
fact
was
,
she
had
been
rich
 
very
rich
;
and
though
,
for
the
present
,
without
the
command
of
money
,
she
was
likely
one
day
to
be
rich
again
.
<EOS>
At
Basseterre
,
in
Guadaloupe
,
she
possessed
a
large
estate
,
received
in
dowry
on
her
marriage
sixty
years
ago
,
sequestered
since
her
husband
's
failure
;
but
now
,
it
was
supposed
,
cleared
of
claim
,
and
,
if
duly
looked
after
by
a
competent
agent
of
integrity
,
considered
capable
of
being
made
,
in
a
few
years
,
largely
productive
.
  
<EOS>
Père
Silas
took
an
interest
in
this
prospective
improvement
for
the
sake
of
religion
and
the
church
,
whereof
Magliore
Walravens
was
a
devout
daughter
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
,
distantly
related
to
the
hunchback
and
knowing
her
to
be
without
family
of
her
own
,
had
long
brooded
over
contingencies
with
a
mother
's
calculating
forethought
,
and
,
harshly
treated
as
she
was
by
Madame
Walravens
,
never
ceased
to
court
her
for
interest
's
sake
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
and
the
priest
were
thus
,
for
money
reasons
,
equally
and
sincerely
interested
in
the
nursing
of
the
West
Indian
estate
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
distance
was
great
,
and
the
climate
hazardous
.
<EOS>
The
competent
and
upright
agent
wanted
,
must
be
a
devoted
man
.
<EOS>
Just
such
a
man
had
Madame
Walravens
retained
for
twenty
years
in
her
service
,
blighting
his
life
,
and
then
living
on
him
,
like
an
old
fungus
;
such
a
man
had
Père
Silas
trained
,
taught
,
and
bound
to
him
by
the
ties
of
gratitude
,
habit
,
and
belief
.
<EOS>
Such
a
man
Madame
Beck
knew
,
and
could
in
some
measure
influence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
pupil
,
"
said
Père
Silas
,
"
if
he
remains
in
Europe
,
runs
risk
of
apostacy
,
for
he
has
become
entangled
with
a
heretic
.
"
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
made
also
her
private
comment
,
and
preferred
in
her
own
breast
her
secret
reason
for
desiring
expatriation
.
<EOS>
The
thing
she
could
not
obtain
,
she
desired
not
another
to
win
:
rather
would
she
destroy
it
.
<EOS>
As
to
Madame
Walravens
,
she
wanted
her
money
and
her
land
,
and
knew
Paul
,
if
he
liked
,
could
make
the
best
and
faithfullest
steward
:
so
the
three
self
-
seekers
banded
and
beset
the
one
unselfish
.
<EOS>
They
reasoned
<EOS>
,
they
appealed
,
they
implored
;
on
his
mercy
they
cast
themselves
,
into
his
hands
they
confidingly
thrust
their
interests
.
<EOS>
They
asked
but
two
or
three
years
of
devotion
 
after
that
,
he
should
live
for
himself
:
one
of
the
number
<EOS>
,
perhaps
,
wished
that
in
the
meantime
he
might
die
.
  
<EOS>
No
living
being
ever
humbly
laid
his
advantage
at
M.
Emanuel
's
feet
,
or
confidingly
put
it
into
his
hands
,
that
he
spurned
the
trust
or
repulsed
the
repository
.
<EOS>
What
might
be
his
private
pain
or
inward
reluctance
to
leave
Europe
 
what
his
calculations
for
his
own
future
 
none
asked
,
or
knew
,
or
reported
.
<EOS>
All
this
was
a
blank
to
me
.
<EOS>
His
conferences
with
his
confessor
I
might
guess
;
the
part
duty
and
religion
were
made
to
play
in
the
persuasions
used
,
I
might
conjecture
.
<EOS>
He
was
gone
,
and
had
made
no
sign
.
<EOS>
There
my
knowledge
closed
.
     
<EOS>
With
my
head
bent
,
and
my
forehead
resting
on
my
hands
,
I
sat
amidst
grouped
tree
-
stems
and
branching
brushwood
.
<EOS>
Whatever
talk
passed
amongst
my
neighbours
,
I
might
hear
,
if
I
would
;
I
was
near
enough
;
but
for
some
time
,
there
was
scarce
motive
to
attend
.
<EOS>
They
gossiped
about
the
dresses
,
the
music
,
the
illuminations
,
the
fine
night
.
<EOS>
I
listened
to
hear
them
say
,
"
It
is
calm
weather
for
_
his
_
voyage
;
<EOS>
the
_
Antigua
_
"
(
his
ship
)
"
will
sail
prosperously
.
"
<EOS>
No
such
remark
fell
;
neither
the
_
Antigua
_
,
nor
her
course
,
nor
her
passenger
were
named
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
light
chat
scarcely
interested
old
Madame
Walravens
more
than
it
did
me
;
she
appeared
restless
,
turning
her
head
now
to
this
side
,
now
that
,
looking
through
the
trees
,
and
among
the
crowd
,
as
if
expectant
of
an
arrival
and
impatient
of
delay
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Où
sont
-
ils
?
<EOS>
Pourquoi
<EOS>
ne
viennent
-
ils
?
<EOS>
"
I
heard
her
mutter
more
than
once
;
and
at
last
,
as
if
determined
to
have
an
answer
to
her
question
 
which
hitherto
none
seemed
to
mind
,
she
spoke
aloud
this
phrase
 
a
phrase
brief
enough
,
simple
enough
,
but
it
sent
a
shock
through
me
 
"
Messieurs
et
mesdames
,
"
said
she
,
"
où
donc
est
Justine
Marie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Justine
Marie
!
<EOS>
"
What
was
this
?
<EOS>
Justine
Marie
 
<EOS>
the
dead
nun
 
<EOS>
where
was
she
?
<EOS>
Why
,
in
her
grave
,
Madame
Walravens
 
<EOS>
what
can
you
want
with
her
?
<EOS>
You
shall
go
to
her
,
but
she
shall
not
come
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
_
I
_
should
have
answered
,
had
the
response
lain
with
me
,
but
nobody
seemed
to
be
of
my
mind
;
nobody
seemed
surprised
,
startled
,
or
at
a
loss
.
<EOS>
The
quietest
commonplace
answer
met
the
strange
,
the
dead
-
disturbing
,
the
Witch
-
of
-
Endor
query
of
the
hunchback
.
  
<EOS>
"
Justine
Marie
,
"
said
one
,
"
is
coming
;
she
is
in
the
kiosk
;
she
will
be
here
presently
.
"
  
<EOS>
Out
of
this
question
and
reply
sprang
a
change
in
the
chat
 
<EOS>
chat
it
still
remained
,
easy
,
desultory
,
familiar
gossip
.
<EOS>
Hint
,
allusion
,
comment
,
went
round
the
circle
,
but
all
so
broken
,
so
dependent
on
references
to
persons
not
named
,
or
circumstances
not
defined
,
that
listen
as
intently
as
I
would
 
<EOS>
and
I
_
<EOS>
did
_
listen
_
now
_
with
a
fated
interest
 
<EOS>
I
could
make
out
no
more
than
that
some
scheme
was
on
foot
,
in
which
this
ghostly
Justine
Marie
 
dead
or
alive
 
was
concerned
.
<EOS>
This
family
-
junta
seemed
grasping
at
her
somehow
,
for
some
reason
;
there
seemed
question
of
a
marriage
,
of
a
fortune
 
for
whom
I
could
not
quite
make
out
-
perhaps
for
Victor
Kint
,
perhaps
for
Josef
Emanuel
 
both
were
bachelors
.
<EOS>
Once
I
thought
the
hints
and
jests
rained
upon
a
young
fair
-
haired
foreigner
of
the
party
,
whom
they
called
Heinrich
Mühler
.
<EOS>
Amidst
all
the
badinage
,
Madame
Walravens
still
obtruded
from
time
to
time
,
hoarse
,
cross
-
grained
speeches
;
her
impatience
being
diverted
only
by
an
implacable
surveillance
of
Désirée
,
who
could
not
stir
but
the
old
woman
menaced
her
with
her
staff
.
  
<EOS>
"
La
voilà
!
<EOS>
"
suddenly
cried
one
of
the
gentlemen
,
"
voilà
Justine
Marie
qui
arrive
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
moment
was
for
me
peculiar
.
<EOS>
I
called
up
to
memory
the
pictured
nun
on
the
panel
;
present
to
my
mind
was
the
sad
love
-
story
;
I
saw
in
thought
the
vision
of
the
garret
,
the
apparition
of
the
alley
,
the
strange
birth
of
the
berceau
;
I
underwent
a
presentiment
of
discovery
,
a
strong
conviction
of
coming
disclosure
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
when
imagination
once
runs
riot
where
do
we
stop
?
<EOS>
What
winter
tree
so
bare
and
branchless
 
what
way
-
side
,
hedge
-
munching
animal
so
humble
,
that
Fancy
,
a
passing
cloud
,
and
a
struggling
moonbeam
,
will
not
clothe
it
in
spirituality
,
and
make
of
it
a
phantom
?
  
<EOS>
With
solemn
force
pressed
on
my
heart
,
the
expectation
of
mystery
breaking
up
:
hitherto
I
had
seen
this
spectre
only
through
a
glass
darkly
;
now
was
I
to
behold
it
face
to
face
.
<EOS>
I
leaned
forward
;
I
looked
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
comes
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Josef
Emanuel
.
  
<EOS>
The
circle
opened
as
if
opening
to
admit
a
new
and
welcome
member
.
<EOS>
At
this
instant
a
torch
chanced
to
be
carried
past
;
its
blaze
aided
the
pale
moon
in
doing
justice
to
the
crisis
,
in
lighting
to
perfection
the
dénouement
pressing
on
.
<EOS>
Surely
those
near
me
must
have
felt
some
little
of
the
anxiety
I
felt
,
in
degree
so
unmeted
.
<EOS>
Of
that
group
the
coolest
must
have
"
held
his
breath
for
a
time
!
"
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
my
life
stood
still
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
over
.
<EOS>
The
moment
and
the
nun
are
come
.
<EOS>
The
crisis
and
the
revelation
are
passed
by
.
  
<EOS>
The
flambeau
glares
still
within
a
yard
,
held
up
in
a
park
-
keeper
's
hand
;
its
long
eager
tongue
of
flame
almost
licks
the
figure
of
the
Expected
 
there
 
where
she
stands
full
in
my
sight
.
<EOS>
What
is
she
like
?
<EOS>
What
does
she
wear
?
<EOS>
How
does
she
look
?
<EOS>
Who
is
she
?
  
<EOS>
There
are
many
masks
in
the
park
to
-
night
,
and
as
the
hour
wears
late
,
so
strange
a
feeling
of
revelry
and
mystery
begins
to
spread
abroad
,
that
scarce
would
you
discredit
me
,
reader
,
were
I
to
say
that
she
is
like
the
nun
of
the
attic
,
that
she
wears
black
skirts
and
white
head
-
clothes
,
that
she
looks
the
resurrection
of
the
flesh
,
and
that
she
is
a
risen
ghost
.
  
<EOS>
All
falsities
 
all
figments
!
<EOS>
We
will
not
deal
in
this
gear
.
<EOS>
Let
us
be
honest
,
and
cut
,
as
heretofore
,
from
the
homely
web
of
truth
.
  
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Homely
_
,
though
,
is
an
ill
-
chosen
word
.
<EOS>
What
I
see
is
not
precisely
homely
.
<EOS>
A
girl
of
Villette
stands
there
 
a
girl
fresh
from
her
pensionnat
.
<EOS>
She
is
very
comely
,
with
the
beauty
indigenous
to
this
country
.
<EOS>
She
looks
well
-
nourished
,
fair
,
and
fat
of
flesh
.
<EOS>
Her
cheeks
are
round
,
<EOS>
her
eyes
good
;
her
hair
is
abundant
.
<EOS>
She
is
handsomely
dressed
.
<EOS>
She
is
not
alone
;
her
escort
consists
of
three
persons
 
<EOS>
two
being
elderly
;
these
she
addresses
as
"
Mon
Oncle
"
and
"
Ma
Tante
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
laughs
,
she
chats
;
good
-
humoured
,
buxom
,
and
blooming
,
she
looks
,
at
all
points
,
the
bourgeoise
belle
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
much
for
Justine
Marie
;
"
so
much
for
ghosts
and
mystery
:
not
that
this
last
was
solved
 
<EOS>
this
girl
certainly
is
not
my
nun
:
<EOS>
what
I
saw
in
the
garret
and
garden
must
have
been
taller
by
a
span
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
looked
at
the
city
belle
;
we
have
cursorily
glanced
at
the
respectable
old
uncle
and
aunt
.
<EOS>
Have
we
a
stray
glance
to
give
to
the
third
member
of
this
company
?
<EOS>
Can
we
spare
him
a
moment
's
notice
?
<EOS>
We
ought
to
distinguish
him
so
far
,
reader
;
he
has
claims
on
us
;
we
do
not
now
meet
him
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
I
clasped
my
hands
very
hard
,
and
I
drew
my
breath
very
deep
<EOS>
:
I
held
in
the
cry
,
I
devoured
the
ejaculation
,
I
forbade
the
start
,
I
spoke
and
I
stirred
no
more
than
a
stone
;
but
I
knew
what
I
looked
on
;
through
the
dimness
left
in
my
eyes
by
many
nights
'
weeping
,
I
knew
him
.
<EOS>
They
said
he
was
to
sail
by
the
_
Antigua
_
.
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
said
so
.
<EOS>
She
lied
,
or
she
had
uttered
what
was
once
truth
,
and
failed
to
contradict
it
when
it
became
false
.
<EOS>
The
_
Antigua
_
was
gone
,
and
there
stood
Paul
Emanuel
.
  
<EOS>
Was
I
glad
?
<EOS>
A
huge
load
left
me
.
<EOS>
Was
it
a
fact
to
warrant
joy
?
<EOS>
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
Ask
first
what
were
the
circumstances
attendant
on
this
respite
?
<EOS>
How
far
did
this
delay
concern
_
me
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Were
there
not
those
whom
it
might
touch
more
nearly
?
  
<EOS>
After
all
,
who
may
this
young
girl
,
this
Justine
Marie
,
be
?
<EOS>
Not
a
stranger
,
reader
;
she
is
known
to
me
by
sight
;
she
visits
at
the
Rue
Fossette
:
<EOS>
she
is
often
of
Madame
Beck
's
Sunday
parties
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
relation
of
both
the
Becks
and
Walravens
;
she
derives
her
baptismal
name
from
the
sainted
nun
who
would
have
been
her
aunt
had
she
lived
;
her
patronymic
is
Sauveur
;
she
is
an
heiress
and
an
orphan
,
and
M.
Emanuel
is
her
guardian
;
some
say
her
godfather
.
  
<EOS>
The
family
junta
wish
this
heiress
to
be
married
to
one
of
their
band
 
which
is
it
?
<EOS>
Vital
question
 
<EOS>
which
is
it
?
  
<EOS>
I
felt
very
glad
now
,
that
the
drug
administered
in
the
sweet
draught
had
filled
me
with
a
possession
which
made
bed
and
chamber
intolerable
.
<EOS>
I
always
,
through
my
whole
life
,
liked
to
penetrate
to
the
real
truth
;
I
like
seeking
the
goddess
in
her
temple
,
and
handling
the
veil
,
and
daring
the
dread
glance
.
<EOS>
O
Titaness
among
deities
!
<EOS>
the
covered
outline
of
thine
aspect
sickens
often
through
its
uncertainty
,
but
define
to
us
one
trait
,
show
us
one
lineament
,
clear
in
awful
sincerity
;
we
may
gasp
in
untold
terror
,
but
with
that
gasp
we
drink
in
a
breath
of
thy
divinity
;
our
heart
shakes
,
and
its
currents
sway
like
rivers
lifted
by
earthquake
,
but
we
have
swallowed
strength
.
<EOS>
To
see
and
know
the
worst
is
to
take
from
Fear
her
main
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
The
Walravens
'
party
,
augmented
in
numbers
,
now
became
very
gay
.
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
fetched
refreshments
from
the
kiosk
,
all
sat
down
on
the
turf
under
the
trees
;
they
drank
healths
and
sentiments
;
they
laughed
,
they
jested
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
underwent
some
raillery
,
half
good
-
humoured
,
half
,
I
thought
,
malicious
,
especially
on
Madame
Beck
's
part
.
<EOS>
I
soon
gathered
that
his
voyage
had
been
temporarily
deferred
of
his
own
will
,
without
the
concurrence
,
even
against
the
advice
,
of
his
friends
;
he
had
let
the
_
Antigua
_
go
,
and
had
taken
his
berth
in
the
_
Paul
et
Virginie
_
,
appointed
to
sail
a
fortnight
later
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
reason
for
this
resolve
which
they
teased
him
to
assign
,
and
which
he
would
only
vaguely
indicate
as
"
the
settlement
of
a
little
piece
of
business
which
he
had
set
his
heart
upon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
_
was
_
<EOS>
this
business
?
<EOS>
Nobody
knew
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
there
was
one
who
seemed
partly
,
at
least
,
in
his
confidence
;
a
meaning
look
passed
between
him
and
Justine
Marie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
La
petite
va
m'aider
 
<EOS>
n'est
-
ce
pas
?
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
The
answer
was
prompt
enough
,
God
knows
?
  
<EOS>
"
Mais
oui
,
je
vous
aiderai
de
tout
mon
coeur
.
<EOS>
Vous
ferez
de
moi
tout
ce
que
vous
voudrez
,
mon
parrain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
this
dear
"
parrain
"
took
her
hand
and
lifted
it
to
his
grateful
lips
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
demonstration
,
I
saw
the
light
-
complexioned
young
Teuton
,
Heinrich
Mühler
,
grow
restless
,
as
if
he
did
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
He
even
grumbled
a
few
words
,
whereat
M.
Emanuel
actually
laughed
in
his
face
,
and
with
the
ruthless
triumph
of
the
assured
conqueror
,
he
drew
his
ward
nearer
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
was
indeed
very
joyous
that
night
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
not
one
whit
subdued
by
the
change
of
scene
and
action
impending
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
true
life
of
the
party
;
a
little
despotic
,
perhaps
,
determined
to
be
chief
in
mirth
,
as
well
as
in
labour
,
yet
from
moment
to
moment
proving
indisputably
his
right
of
leadership
.
<EOS>
His
was
the
wittiest
word
,
the
pleasantest
anecdote
,
the
frankest
laugh
.
<EOS>
Restlessly
active
,
after
his
manner
,
he
multiplied
himself
to
wait
on
all
;
but
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
saw
which
was
his
favourite
.
<EOS>
I
saw
at
whose
feet
he
lay
on
the
turf
<EOS>
,
I
saw
whom
he
folded
carefully
from
the
night
air
,
whom
he
tended
,
watched
,
and
cherished
as
the
apple
of
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
hint
and
raillery
flew
thick
,
and
still
I
gathered
that
while
M.
Paul
should
be
absent
,
working
for
others
,
these
others
,
not
quite
ungrateful
,
would
guard
for
him
the
treasure
he
left
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
Let
him
bring
them
an
Indian
fortune
:
they
would
give
him
in
return
a
young
bride
and
a
rich
inheritance
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
saintly
consecration
,
the
vow
of
constancy
,
that
was
forgotten
:
the
blooming
and
charming
Present
prevailed
over
the
Past
;
and
,
at
length
,
his
nun
was
indeed
buried
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
it
must
be
.
<EOS>
The
revelation
was
indeed
come
.
<EOS>
Presentiment
had
not
been
mistaken
in
her
impulse
:
there
is
a
kind
of
presentiment
which
never
_
is
_
mistaken
;
it
was
I
who
had
for
a
moment
miscalculated
;
not
seeing
the
true
bearing
of
the
oracle
,
I
had
thought
she
muttered
of
vision
when
,
in
truth
,
her
prediction
touched
reality
.
  
<EOS>
I
might
have
paused
longer
upon
what
I
saw
;
I
might
have
deliberated
ere
<EOS>
I
drew
inferences
.
<EOS>
Some
,
perhaps
,
would
have
held
the
premises
doubtful
,
the
proofs
insufficient
;
some
slow
sceptics
would
have
incredulously
examined
ere
they
conclusively
accepted
the
project
of
a
marriage
between
a
poor
and
unselfish
man
of
forty
,
and
his
wealthy
ward
of
eighteen
;
but
far
from
me
such
shifts
and
palliatives
,
far
from
me
such
temporary
evasion
of
the
actual
,
such
coward
fleeing
from
the
dread
,
the
swift
-
footed
,
the
all
-
overtaking
Fact
,
such
feeble
suspense
of
submission
to
her
the
sole
sovereign
,
such
paltering
and
faltering
resistance
to
the
Power
whose
errand
is
to
march
conquering
and
to
conquer
,
such
traitor
defection
from
the
TRUTH
.
  
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
hastened
to
accept
the
whole
plan
.
<EOS>
I
extended
my
grasp
and
took
it
all
in
.
<EOS>
I
gathered
it
to
me
with
a
sort
of
rage
of
haste
,
and
folded
it
round
me
,
as
the
soldier
struck
on
the
field
folds
his
colours
about
his
breast
.
<EOS>
I
invoked
Conviction
to
nail
upon
me
the
certainty
,
abhorred
while
embraced
,
to
fix
it
with
the
strongest
spikes
her
strongest
strokes
could
drive
;
and
when
the
iron
had
entered
well
my
soul
,
I
stood
up
,
as
I
thought
,
renovated
.
  
<EOS>
In
my
infatuation
,
I
said
,
"
Truth
,
you
are
a
good
mistress
to
your
faithful
servants
!
<EOS>
While
a
Lie
pressed
me
,
how
I
suffered
!
<EOS>
Even
when
the
Falsehood
was
still
sweet
,
still
flattering
to
the
fancy
,
and
warm
to
the
feelings
,
it
wasted
me
with
hourly
torment
.
<EOS>
The
persuasion
that
affection
was
won
could
not
be
divorced
from
the
dread
that
,
by
another
turn
of
the
wheel
,
it
might
be
lost
.
<EOS>
Truth
stripped
away
Falsehood
,
and
Flattery
,
and
Expectancy
,
and
here
I
stand
 
free
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Nothing
remained
now
but
to
take
my
freedom
to
my
chamber
,
to
carry
it
with
me
to
my
bed
and
see
what
I
could
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
play
was
not
yet
,
indeed
,
quite
played
out
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
waited
and
watched
longer
that
love
-
scene
under
the
trees
,
that
sylvan
courtship
.
<EOS>
Had
there
been
nothing
of
love
in
the
demonstration
<EOS>
,
my
Fancy
in
this
hour
was
so
generous
,
so
creative
,
she
could
have
modelled
for
it
the
most
salient
lineaments
,
and
given
it
the
deepest
life
and
highest
colour
of
passion
.
<EOS>
But
I
_
would
_
not
look
;
I
had
fixed
my
resolve
,
but
I
would
not
violate
my
nature
.
<EOS>
And
then
 
something
tore
me
so
cruelly
under
my
shawl
,
something
so
dug
into
my
side
,
a
vulture
so
strong
in
beak
and
talon
,
I
must
be
alone
to
grapple
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
never
felt
jealousy
till
now
.
<EOS>
This
was
not
like
enduring
the
endearments
of
Dr.
John
and
Paulina
,
against
which
while
I
sealed
my
eyes
and
my
ears
,
while
I
withdrew
thence
<EOS>
my
thoughts
,
my
sense
of
harmony
still
acknowledged
in
it
a
charm
.
<EOS>
This
was
an
outrage
.
<EOS>
The
love
born
of
beauty
was
not
mine
;
I
had
nothing
in
common
with
it
:
I
could
not
dare
to
meddle
with
it
,
but
another
love
,
venturing
diffidently
into
life
after
long
acquaintance
,
furnace
-
tried
by
pain
,
stamped
by
constancy
,
consolidated
by
affection
's
pure
and
durable
alloy
,
submitted
by
intellect
to
intellect
's
own
tests
,
and
finally
wrought
up
,
by
his
own
process
,
to
his
own
unflawed
completeness
,
this
Love
that
laughed
at
Passion
,
his
fast
frenzies
and
his
hot
and
hurried
extinction
,
in
_
<EOS>
this
_
Love
<EOS>
I
had
a
vested
interest
;
and
whatever
tended
either
to
its
culture
or
its
destruction
,
I
could
not
view
impassibly
.
  
<EOS>
I
turned
from
the
group
of
trees
and
the
"
merrie
companie
"
in
its
shade
.
<EOS>
Midnight
was
long
past
;
the
concert
was
over
,
the
crowds
were
thinning
.
<EOS>
I
followed
the
ebb
.
<EOS>
Leaving
the
radiant
park
and
well
-
lit
Haute
-
Ville
(
still
well
lit
,
this
it
seems
was
to
be
a
"
nuit
blanche
"
in
Villette
)
,
I
sought
the
dim
lower
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
Dim
I
should
not
say
,
for
the
beauty
of
moonlight
 
forgotten
in
the
park
 
here
once
more
flowed
in
upon
perception
.
<EOS>
High
she
rode
,
and
calm
and
stainlessly
she
shone
.
<EOS>
The
music
and
the
mirth
of
the
fête
,
the
fire
and
bright
hues
of
those
lamps
had
out
-
done
and
out
-
shone
her
for
an
hour
,
but
now
,
again
,
her
glory
and
her
silence
triumphed
.
<EOS>
The
rival
lamps
were
dying
:
she
held
her
course
like
a
white
fate
.
<EOS>
Drum
,
trumpet
,
bugle
,
had
uttered
their
clangour
,
and
were
forgotten
;
with
pencil
-
ray
she
wrote
on
heaven
and
on
earth
records
for
archives
everlasting
.
<EOS>
She
and
those
stars
seemed
to
me
at
once
the
types
and
witnesses
of
truth
all
regnant
.
<EOS>
The
night
-
sky
lit
her
reign
:
like
its
slow
-
wheeling
progress
,
advanced
her
victory
 
<EOS>
that
onward
movement
which
has
been
,
and
is
,
and
will
be
from
eternity
to
eternity
.
  
<EOS>
These
oil
-
twinkling
streets
are
very
still
:
I
like
them
for
their
lowliness
and
peace
.
<EOS>
Homeward
-
bound
burghers
pass
me
now
and
then
,
but
these
companies
are
pedestrians
,
make
little
noise
,
and
are
soon
gone
.
<EOS>
So
well
do
I
love
Villette
under
her
present
aspect
,
not
willingly
would
I
re
-
enter
under
a
roof
,
but
that
I
am
bent
on
pursuing
my
strange
adventure
to
a
successful
close
,
and
quietly
regaining
my
bed
in
the
great
dormitory
,
before
Madame
Beck
comes
home
.
  
<EOS>
Only
one
street
lies
between
me
and
the
Rue
Fossette
;
as
I
enter
it
,
for
the
first
time
,
the
sound
of
a
carriage
tears
up
the
deep
peace
of
this
quarter
.
<EOS>
It
comes
this
way
 
<EOS>
comes
very
fast
.
<EOS>
How
loud
sounds
its
rattle
on
the
paved
path
!
<EOS>
The
street
is
narrow
,
and
I
keep
carefully
to
the
causeway
.
<EOS>
The
carriage
thunders
past
,
but
what
do
I
see
,
or
fancy
<EOS>
I
see
,
as
it
rushes
by
?
<EOS>
Surely
something
white
fluttered
from
that
window
 
surely
a
hand
waved
a
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
Was
that
signal
meant
for
me
?
<EOS>
Am
I
known
?
<EOS>
Who
could
recognise
me
?
<EOS>
That
is
not
M.
de
Bassompierre
's
carriage
,
nor
Mrs.
Bretton
's
;
and
besides
,
neither
the
Hôtel
Crécy
nor
the
château
of
La
Terrasse
lies
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
have
no
time
for
conjecture
;
I
must
hurry
home
.
  
<EOS>
Gaining
the
Rue
Fossette
,
reaching
the
pensionnat
,
all
there
was
still
;
no
fiacre
had
yet
arrived
with
Madame
and
Désirée
.
<EOS>
I
had
left
the
great
door
ajar
;
should
I
find
it
thus
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
wind
or
some
other
accident
may
have
thrown
it
to
with
sufficient
force
to
start
the
spring
-
bolt
?
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
hopeless
became
admission
;
my
adventure
must
issue
in
catastrophe
.
<EOS>
I
lightly
pushed
the
heavy
leaf
;
would
it
yield
?
  
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
As
soundless
,
as
unresisting
,
as
if
some
propitious
genius
had
waited
on
a
sesame
-
charm
,
in
the
vestibule
within
.
<EOS>
Entering
with
bated
breath
,
quietly
making
all
fast
,
shoelessly
mounting
the
staircase
,
I
sought
the
dormitory
,
and
reached
my
couch
.
     
<EOS>
Ay
!
<EOS>
I
reached
it
,
and
once
more
drew
a
free
inspiration
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
,
I
almost
shrieked
 
almost
,
but
not
quite
,
thank
Heaven
!
  
<EOS>
Throughout
the
dormitory
,
throughout
the
house
,
there
reigned
at
this
hour
the
stillness
of
death
.
<EOS>
All
slept
,
and
in
such
hush
,
it
seemed
that
none
dreamed
.
<EOS>
Stretched
on
the
nineteen
beds
lay
nineteen
forms
,
at
full
-
length
and
motionless
.
<EOS>
On
mine
 
the
twentieth
couch
 
<EOS>
nothing
_
ought
_
to
have
lain
<EOS>
:
I
had
left
it
void
,
and
void
should
have
found
it
.
<EOS>
What
,
then
;
do
I
see
between
the
half
-
drawn
curtains
?
<EOS>
What
dark
,
usurping
shape
,
supine
,
long
,
and
strange
?
<EOS>
Is
it
a
robber
who
has
made
his
way
through
the
open
street
-
door
,
and
lies
there
in
wait
?
<EOS>
It
looks
very
black
,
I
think
it
looks
 
not
human
.
<EOS>
Can
it
be
a
wandering
dog
that
has
come
in
from
the
street
and
crept
and
nestled
hither
?
<EOS>
Will
it
spring
,
will
it
leap
out
if
I
approach
?
<EOS>
Approach
I
must
.
<EOS>
Courage
!
<EOS>
One
step
!
    
<EOS>
My
head
reeled
,
for
by
the
faint
night
-
lamp
<EOS>
,
I
saw
stretched
on
my
bed
the
old
phantom
 
the
NUN
.
  
<EOS>
A
cry
at
this
moment
might
have
ruined
me
.
<EOS>
Be
the
spectacle
what
it
might
,
I
could
afford
neither
consternation
,
scream
,
nor
swoon
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
was
not
overcome
.
<EOS>
Tempered
by
late
incidents
,
my
nerves
disdained
hysteria
.
<EOS>
Warm
from
illuminations
,
and
music
,
and
thronging
thousands
,
thoroughly
lashed
up
by
a
new
scourge
,
I
defied
spectra
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
,
without
exclamation
,
I
had
rushed
on
the
haunted
couch
;
nothing
leaped
out
,
or
sprung
,
or
stirred
;
all
the
movement
was
mine
,
so
was
all
the
life
,
the
reality
,
the
substance
,
the
force
;
as
my
instinct
felt
.
<EOS>
I
tore
her
up
 
the
incubus
!
<EOS>
I
held
her
on
high
 
the
goblin
!
<EOS>
I
shook
her
loose
 
the
mystery
!
<EOS>
And
down
she
fell
 
down
all
around
me
 
down
in
shreds
and
fragments
 
<EOS>
and
I
trode
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
Here
again
 
behold
the
branchless
tree
,
the
unstabled
Rosinante
;
the
film
of
cloud
,
the
flicker
of
moonshine
.
<EOS>
The
long
nun
proved
a
long
bolster
dressed
in
a
long
black
stole
,
and
artfully
invested
with
a
white
veil
.
<EOS>
The
garments
in
very
truth
,
strange
as
it
may
seem
,
were
genuine
nun
's
garments
,
and
by
some
hand
they
had
been
disposed
with
a
view
to
illusion
.
<EOS>
Whence
came
these
vestments
?
<EOS>
Who
contrived
this
artifice
?
<EOS>
These
questions
still
remained
.
<EOS>
To
the
head
-
bandage
was
pinned
a
slip
of
paper
:
it
bore
in
pencil
these
mocking
words
    
"
The
nun
of
the
attic
bequeaths
to
<EOS>
Lucy
Snowe
<EOS>
her
wardrobe
.
<EOS>
She
will
be
seen
in
the
Rue
Fossette
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
what
and
who
was
she
that
had
haunted
me
?
<EOS>
She
,
I
had
actually
seen
three
times
.
<EOS>
Not
a
woman
of
my
acquaintance
had
the
stature
of
that
ghost
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
of
a
female
height
.
<EOS>
Not
to
any
man
I
knew
could
the
machination
,
for
a
moment
,
be
attributed
.
  
<EOS>
Still
mystified
beyond
expression
,
but
as
thoroughly
,
as
suddenly
,
relieved
from
all
sense
of
the
spectral
and
unearthly
;
scorning
also
to
wear
out
my
brain
with
the
fret
of
a
trivial
though
insoluble
riddle
,
I
just
bundled
together
stole
,
veil
,
and
bandages
,
thrust
them
beneath
my
pillow
,
lay
down
,
listened
till
I
heard
the
wheels
of
Madame
's
home
-
returning
fiacre
,
then
turned
,
and
worn
out
by
many
nights
'
vigils
,
conquered
,
too
,
perhaps
,
by
the
now
reacting
narcotic
,
I
deeply
slept
.
    
<EOS>
THE
HAPPY
PAIR
.
  
<EOS>
The
day
succeeding
this
remarkable
Midsummer
night
,
proved
no
common
day
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
that
it
brought
signs
in
heaven
above
,
or
portents
on
the
earth
beneath
;
nor
do
I
allude
to
meteorological
phenomena
,
to
storm
,
flood
,
or
whirlwind
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
:
the
sun
rose
jocund
,
with
a
July
face
.
<EOS>
Morning
decked
her
beauty
with
rubies
,
and
so
filled
her
lap
with
roses
,
that
they
fell
from
her
in
showers
,
making
her
path
blush
:
<EOS>
the
Hours
woke
fresh
as
nymphs
,
and
emptying
on
the
early
hills
their
dew
-
vials
,
they
stepped
out
dismantled
of
vapour
:
shadowless
,
azure
,
and
glorious
<EOS>
,
they
led
the
sun
's
steeds
on
a
burning
and
unclouded
course
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
it
was
as
fine
a
day
as
the
finest
summer
could
boast
;
but
I
doubt
whether
I
was
not
the
sole
inhabitant
of
the
Rue
Fossette
,
who
cared
or
remembered
to
note
this
pleasant
fact
.
<EOS>
Another
thought
busied
all
other
heads
;
a
thought
,
indeed
,
which
had
its
share
in
my
meditations
;
but
this
master
consideration
,
not
possessing
for
me
so
entire
a
novelty
,
so
overwhelming
a
suddenness
,
especially
so
dense
a
mystery
,
as
it
offered
to
the
majority
of
my
co
-
speculators
thereon
,
left
me
somewhat
more
open
than
the
rest
to
any
collateral
observation
or
impression
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
while
walking
in
the
garden
,
feeling
the
sunshine
,
and
marking
the
blooming
and
growing
plants
,
I
pondered
the
same
subject
the
whole
house
discussed
.
  
<EOS>
What
subject
?
  
<EOS>
Merely
this
.
<EOS>
When
matins
came
to
be
said
,
there
was
a
place
vacant
in
the
first
rank
of
boarders
.
<EOS>
When
breakfast
was
served
,
there
remained
a
coffee
-
cup
unclaimed
.
<EOS>
When
the
housemaid
made
the
beds
,
she
found
in
one
,
a
bolster
laid
lengthwise
,
clad
in
a
cap
and
night
-
gown
;
and
when
Ginevra
Fanshawe
's
music
-
mistress
came
early
,
as
usual
,
to
give
the
morning
lesson
,
that
accomplished
and
promising
young
person
,
her
pupil
,
failed
utterly
to
be
forthcoming
.
  
<EOS>
High
and
low
was
<EOS>
Miss
Fanshawe
sought
;
through
length
and
breadth
was
the
house
ransacked
;
vainly
;
not
a
trace
,
not
an
indication
,
<EOS>
not
so
much
as
a
scrap
of
a
billet
rewarded
the
search
;
the
nymph
was
vanished
,
engulfed
in
the
past
night
,
like
a
shooting
star
swallowed
up
by
darkness
.
  
<EOS>
Deep
was
the
dismay
of
surveillante
teachers
,
deeper
the
horror
of
the
defaulting
directress
.
<EOS>
Never
had
I
seen
Madame
Beck
so
pale
or
so
appalled
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
blow
struck
at
her
tender
part
,
her
weak
side
;
here
was
damage
done
to
her
interest
.
<EOS>
How
,
too
,
had
the
untoward
event
happened
?
<EOS>
By
what
outlet
had
the
fugitive
taken
wing
?
<EOS>
Not
a
casement
was
found
unfastened
,
not
a
pane
of
glass
broken
;
all
the
doors
were
bolted
secure
.
<EOS>
Never
to
this
day
has
Madame
Beck
obtained
satisfaction
on
this
point
,
nor
indeed
has
anybody
else
concerned
,
save
and
excepting
one
,
Lucy
Snowe
,
who
could
not
forget
how
,
to
facilitate
a
certain
enterprise
,
a
certain
great
door
had
been
drawn
softly
to
its
lintel
,
closed
,
indeed
,
but
neither
bolted
nor
secure
.
<EOS>
The
thundering
carriage
-
and
-
pair
encountered
were
now
likewise
recalled
,
as
well
as
that
puzzling
signal
,
the
waved
handkerchief
.
  
<EOS>
From
these
premises
,
and
one
or
two
others
,
inaccessible
to
any
but
myself
,
I
could
draw
but
one
inference
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
case
of
elopement
.
<EOS>
Morally
certain
on
this
head
,
and
seeing
Madame
Beck
's
profound
embarrassment
,
I
at
last
communicated
my
conviction
.
<EOS>
Having
alluded
to
M.
de
Hamal
's
suit
,
I
found
,
as
I
expected
,
that
Madame
Beck
was
perfectly
au
fait
to
that
affair
.
<EOS>
She
had
long
since
discussed
it
with
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
,
and
laid
her
own
responsibility
in
the
business
on
that
lady
's
shoulders
.
<EOS>
To
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
and
M.
de
Bassompierre
<EOS>
she
now
had
recourse
.
  
<EOS>
We
found
that
the
Hôtel
Crécy
was
already
alive
to
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
Ginevra
had
written
to
her
cousin
Paulina
,
vaguely
signifying
hymeneal
intentions
;
communications
had
been
received
from
the
family
of
de
Hamal
;
M.
de
Bassompierre
was
on
the
track
of
the
fugitives
.
<EOS>
He
overtook
them
too
late
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
week
,
the
post
brought
me
a
note
.
<EOS>
I
may
as
well
transcribe
it
;
it
contains
explanation
on
more
than
one
point
:
    
"
DEAR
OLD
TIM
"
(
short
for
Timon
)
,
 
"
<EOS>
I
am
off
<EOS>
you
see
 
gone
like
a
shot
.
<EOS>
Alfred
and
I
intended
to
be
married
in
this
way
almost
from
the
first
;
we
never
meant
to
be
spliced
in
the
humdrum
way
of
other
people
;
Alfred
has
too
much
spirit
for
that
,
and
so
have
I
 
Dieu
merci
!
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
Alfred
,
who
used
to
call
you
"
the
dragon
,
"
has
seen
so
much
of
you
during
the
last
few
months
,
that
he
begins
to
feel
quite
friendly
towards
you
.
<EOS>
He
hopes
you
wo
n't
miss
him
now
that
he
has
gone
;
he
begs
to
apologize
for
any
little
trouble
he
may
have
given
you
.
<EOS>
He
is
afraid
he
rather
inconvenienced
you
once
when
he
came
upon
you
in
the
grenier
,
just
as
you
were
reading
a
letter
seemingly
of
the
most
special
interest
;
but
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
give
you
a
start
,
you
appeared
so
wonderfully
taken
up
with
your
correspondent
.
<EOS>
En
revanche
,
he
says
you
once
frightened
him
by
rushing
in
for
a
dress
or
a
shawl
,
or
some
other
chiffon
,
at
the
moment
when
he
had
struck
a
light
,
and
was
going
to
take
a
quiet
whiff
of
his
cigar
,
while
waiting
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
begin
to
comprehend
by
this
time
that
M.
le
Comte
de
Hamal
was
the
nun
of
the
attic
,
and
that
he
came
to
see
your
humble
servant
?
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
how
he
managed
it
.
<EOS>
You
know
he
has
the
entrée
of
the
Athénée
,
where
two
or
three
of
his
nephews
,
the
sons
of
his
eldest
sister
,
Madame
de
Melcy
,
are
students
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
court
of
the
Athénée
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
high
wall
bounding
your
walk
,
the
allée
défendue
.
<EOS>
Alfred
can
climb
as
well
as
he
can
dance
or
fence
:
his
amusement
was
to
make
the
escalade
of
our
pensionnat
by
mounting
,
first
the
wall
;
then
 
by
the
aid
of
that
high
tree
overspreading
the
grand
berceau
,
and
resting
some
of
its
boughs
on
the
roof
of
the
lower
buildings
of
our
premises
 
he
managed
to
scale
the
first
classe
and
the
grand
salle
.
<EOS>
One
night
,
by
the
way
,
he
fell
out
of
this
tree
,
tore
down
some
of
the
branches
,
nearly
broke
his
own
neck
,
and
after
all
,
in
running
away
,
got
a
terrible
fright
,
and
was
nearly
caught
by
two
people
,
Madame
Beck
and
M.
Emanuel
,
he
thinks
,
walking
in
the
alley
.
<EOS>
From
the
grande
salle
the
ascent
is
not
difficult
to
the
highest
block
of
building
,
finishing
in
the
great
garret
.
<EOS>
The
skylight
,
you
know
,
is
,
day
and
night
,
left
half
open
for
air
;
by
the
skylight
he
entered
.
<EOS>
Nearly
a
year
ago
I
chanced
to
tell
him
our
legend
of
the
nun
;
that
suggested
his
romantic
idea
of
the
spectral
disguise
,
which
I
think
you
must
allow
he
has
very
cleverly
carried
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
for
the
nun
's
black
gown
and
white
veil
,
he
would
have
been
caught
again
and
again
both
by
you
and
that
tiger
-
Jesuit
,
M.
Paul
.
<EOS>
He
thinks
you
both
capital
ghost
-
seers
,
and
very
brave
.
<EOS>
What
I
wonder
at
is
,
rather
your
secretiveness
than
your
courage
.
<EOS>
How
could
you
endure
the
visitations
of
that
long
spectre
,
time
after
time
,
without
crying
out
,
telling
everybody
,
and
rousing
the
whole
house
and
neighbourhood
?
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
and
how
did
you
like
the
nun
as
a
bed
-
fellow
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
dressed
her
up
<EOS>
:
did
n't
I
do
it
well
?
<EOS>
Did
you
shriek
when
you
saw
her
<EOS>
:
I
should
have
gone
mad
;
but
then
you
have
such
nerves
!
 
<EOS>
real
iron
and
bend
-
leather
!
<EOS>
I
believe
you
feel
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
have
n't
the
same
sensitiveness
that
a
person
of
my
constitution
has
.
<EOS>
You
seem
to
me
insensible
both
to
pain
and
fear
and
grief
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
real
old
Diogenes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
dear
grandmother
!
<EOS>
and
are
you
not
mightily
angry
at
my
moonlight
flitting
and
run
away
match
?
<EOS>
I
assure
you
it
is
excellent
fun
,
and
I
did
it
partly
to
spite
that
minx
,
Paulina
,
and
that
bear
,
Dr.
John
:
to
show
them
that
,
with
all
their
airs
,
I
could
get
married
as
well
as
they
.
<EOS>
M.
de
Bassompierre
was
at
first
in
a
strange
fume
with
Alfred
;
he
threatened
a
prosecution
for
"
détournement
de
mineur
,
"
and
I
know
not
what
;
he
was
so
abominably
in
earnest
,
that
I
found
myself
forced
to
do
a
little
bit
of
the
melodramatic
 
go
down
on
my
knees
,
sob
,
cry
,
drench
three
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
"
mon
oncle
"
soon
gave
in
;
indeed
,
where
was
the
use
of
making
a
fuss
?
<EOS>
I
am
married
,
and
that
's
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
still
says
our
marriage
is
not
legal
,
because
I
am
not
of
age
,
forsooth
!
<EOS>
As
if
that
made
any
difference
!
<EOS>
I
am
just
as
much
married
as
if
I
were
a
hundred
.
<EOS>
However
,
we
are
to
be
married
again
,
and
I
am
to
have
a
trousseau
,
and
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
is
going
to
superintend
it
;
and
there
are
some
hopes
that
M.
de
Bassompierre
will
give
me
a
decent
portion
,
which
will
be
very
convenient
,
as
dear
Alfred
has
nothing
but
his
nobility
,
native
and
hereditary
,
and
his
pay
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
uncle
would
do
things
unconditionally
,
in
a
generous
,
gentleman
-
like
fashion
;
he
is
so
disagreeable
as
to
make
the
dowry
depend
on
Alfred
's
giving
his
written
promise
that
he
will
never
touch
cards
or
dice
from
the
day
it
is
paid
down
.
<EOS>
They
accuse
my
angel
of
a
tendency
to
play
:
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
that
,
but
I
_
do
<EOS>
_
know
he
is
a
dear
,
adorable
creature
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
sufficiently
extol
the
genius
with
which
de
Hamal
managed
our
flight
.
<EOS>
How
clever
in
him
to
select
the
night
of
the
fête
,
when
Madame
(
for
he
knows
her
habits
)
,
as
he
said
,
would
infallibly
be
absent
at
the
concert
in
the
park
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
_
you
_
must
have
gone
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
watched
you
rise
and
leave
the
dormitory
about
eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
How
you
returned
alone
,
and
on
foot
,
I
can
not
conjecture
.
<EOS>
That
surely
was
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
we
met
in
the
narrow
old
Rue
St.
Jean
?
<EOS>
Did
you
see
me
wave
my
handkerchief
from
the
carriage
window
?
  
<EOS>
"
Adieu
!
<EOS>
Rejoice
in

GINEVRA

"
P.S.
 
<EOS>
Remember
,
I
am
a
countess
now
.
<EOS>
Papa
,
mamma
,
and
the
girls
at
home
,
will
be
delighted
to
hear
that
.
<EOS>
"
My
daughter
the
Countess
!
"
<EOS>
"
My
sister
the
Countess
!

<EOS>
Bravo
!
<EOS>
Sounds
rather
better
than
Mrs.
John
Bretton

hein
?
"
     
<EOS>
In
winding
up
Mistress
Fanshawe
's
memoirs
,
the
reader
will
no
doubt
expect
to
hear
that
she
came
finally
to
bitter
expiation
of
her
youthful
levities
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
a
large
share
of
suffering
lies
in
reserve
for
her
future
.
  
<EOS>
A
few
words
will
embody
my
farther
knowledge
respecting
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
her
towards
the
close
of
her
honeymoon
.
<EOS>
She
called
on
Madame
Beck
,
and
sent
for
me
into
the
salon
.
<EOS>
She
rushed
into
my
arms
laughing
.
<EOS>
She
looked
very
blooming
and
beautiful
:
her
curls
were
longer
,
her
cheeks
rosier
than
ever
:
<EOS>
her
white
bonnet
and
her
Flanders
veil
,
her
orange
-
flowers
and
her
bride
's
dress
,
became
her
mightily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
got
my
portion
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
at
once
;
(
Ginevra
ever
stuck
to
the
substantial
;
I
always
thought
there
was
a
good
trading
element
in
her
composition
,
much
as
she
scorned
the
"
bourgeoise
;
"
)
"
and
uncle
de
Bassompierre
is
quite
reconciled
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
his
calling
Alfred
a
"
nincompoop
"
 
<EOS>
that
's
only
his
coarse
Scotch
breeding
;
and
I
believe
Paulina
envies
me
,
and
Dr.
John
is
wild
with
jealousy
 
<EOS>
fit
to
blow
his
brains
out
 
<EOS>
and
I
'm
so
happy
!
<EOS>
I
really
think
I
've
hardly
anything
left
to
wish
for
 
unless
it
be
a
carriage
and
an
hotel
,
and
,
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
 
must
introduce
you
to
"
mon
mari
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alfred
,
come
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
Alfred
appeared
from
the
inner
salon
,
where
he
was
talking
to
Madame
Beck
,
receiving
the
blended
felicitations
and
reprimands
of
that
lady
.
<EOS>
I
was
presented
under
my
various
names
:
the
Dragon
,
Diogenes
,
and
Timon
.
<EOS>
The
young
Colonel
was
very
polite
.
<EOS>
He
made
me
a
prettily
-
turned
,
neatly
-
worded
apology
,
about
the
ghost
-
visits
,
&
c.
,
concluding
with
saying
that
"
the
best
excuse
for
all
his
iniquities
stood
there
!
"
<EOS>
pointing
to
his
bride
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
the
bride
sent
him
back
to
Madame
Beck
,
and
she
took
me
to
herself
,
and
proceeded
literally
to
suffocate
me
with
her
unrestrained
spirits
,
her
girlish
,
giddy
,
wild
nonsense
.
<EOS>
She
showed
her
ring
exultingly
;
she
called
herself
Madame
la
Comtesse
de
Hamal
,
and
asked
how
it
sounded
,
a
score
of
times
.
<EOS>
I
said
very
little
.
<EOS>
I
gave
her
only
the
crust
and
rind
of
my
nature
.
<EOS>
No
matter
she
expected
of
me
nothing
better
 
<EOS>
she
knew
me
too
well
to
look
for
compliments
 
my
dry
gibes
pleased
her
well
enough
and
<EOS>
the
more
impassible
and
prosaic
my
mien
,
the
more
merrily
she
laughed
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
his
marriage
,
M.
de
Hamal
was
persuaded
to
leave
the
army
as
the
surest
way
of
weaning
him
from
certain
unprofitable
associates
and
habits
;
a
post
of
attaché
was
procured
for
him
,
and
he
and
his
young
wife
went
abroad
.
<EOS>
I
thought
she
would
forget
me
now
,
but
she
did
not
.
<EOS>
For
many
years
,
she
kept
up
a
capricious
,
fitful
sort
of
correspondence
.
<EOS>
During
the
first
year
or
two
,
it
was
only
of
herself
and
Alfred
<EOS>
she
wrote
;
then
,
Alfred
faded
in
the
background
;
herself
and
a
certain
,
new
comer
prevailed
;
one
Alfred
Fanshawe
de
Bassompierre
de
Hamal
began
to
reign
in
his
father
's
stead
.
<EOS>
There
were
great
boastings
about
this
personage
,
extravagant
amplifications
upon
miracles
of
precocity
,
mixed
with
vehement
objurgations
against
the
phlegmatic
incredulity
with
which
I
received
them
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
"
what
it
was
to
be
a
mother
;
"
"
unfeeling
thing
that
I
was
,
the
sensibilities
of
the
maternal
heart
were
Greek
and
Hebrew
to
me
,
"
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
In
due
course
of
nature
this
young
gentleman
took
his
degrees
in
teething
,
measles
,
<EOS>
hooping
-
cough
<EOS>
:
that
was
a
terrible
time
for
me
 
<EOS>
the
mamma
's
letters
became
a
perfect
shout
of
affliction
;
never
woman
was
so
put
upon
by
calamity
:
never
human
being
stood
in
such
need
of
sympathy
.
<EOS>
I
was
frightened
at
first
,
and
wrote
back
pathetically
;
but
I
soon
found
out
there
was
more
cry
than
wool
in
the
business
,
and
relapsed
into
my
natural
cruel
insensibility
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
youthful
sufferer
,
he
weathered
each
storm
like
a
hero
.
<EOS>
Five
times
was
that
youth
"
in
articulo
mortis
,
"
and
five
times
did
he
miraculously
revive
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
years
there
arose
ominous
murmurings
against
Alfred
the
First
;
M.
de
Bassompierre
had
to
be
appealed
to
,
debts
had
to
be
paid
,
some
of
them
of
that
dismal
and
dingy
order
called
"
debts
of
honour
;
"
ignoble
plaints
and
difficulties
became
frequent
.
<EOS>
Under
every
cloud
,
no
matter
what
its
nature
,
Ginevra
,
as
of
old
,
called
out
lustily
for
sympathy
and
aid
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
notion
of
meeting
any
distress
single
-
handed
.
<EOS>
In
some
shape
,
from
some
quarter
or
other
,
she
was
pretty
sure
to
obtain
her
will
,
and
so
she
got
on
 
fighting
the
battle
of
life
by
proxy
,
and
,
on
the
whole
,
suffering
as
little
as
any
human
being
<EOS>
I
have
ever
known
.
    
<EOS>
FAUBOURG
CLOTILDE
.
  
<EOS>
Must
I
,
ere
I
close
,
render
some
account
of
that
Freedom
and
Renovation
which
I
won
on
the
fête
-
night
?
<EOS>
Must
I
tell
how
I
and
the
two
stalwart
companions
<EOS>
I
brought
home
from
the
illuminated
park
bore
the
test
of
intimate
acquaintance
?
  
<EOS>
I
tried
them
the
very
next
day
.
<EOS>
They
had
boasted
their
strength
loudly
when
they
reclaimed
me
from
love
and
its
bondage
,
but
upon
my
demanding
deeds
,
not
words
,
some
evidence
of
better
comfort
,
some
experience
of
a
relieved
life
 
Freedom
excused
himself
,
as
for
the
present
impoverished
and
disabled
to
assist
;
and
Renovation
never
spoke
;
he
had
died
in
the
night
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
nothing
left
for
it
then
but
to
trust
secretly
that
conjecture
might
have
hurried
me
too
fast
and
too
far
,
to
sustain
the
oppressive
hour
by
reminders
of
the
distorting
and
discolouring
magic
of
jealousy
.
<EOS>
After
a
short
and
vain
struggle
,
I
found
myself
brought
back
captive
to
the
old
rack
of
suspense
,
tied
down
and
strained
anew
.
  
<EOS>
Shall
I
yet
see
him
before
he
goes
?
<EOS>
Will
he
bear
me
in
mind
?
<EOS>
Does
he
purpose
to
come
?
<EOS>
Will
this
day
 
will
the
next
hour
bring
him
?
<EOS>
or
must
I
again
assay
that
corroding
pain
of
long
attent
 
that
rude
agony
of
rupture
at
the
close
,
that
mute
,
mortal
wrench
,
which
,
in
at
once
uprooting
hope
and
doubt
,
shakes
life
;
while
the
hand
that
does
the
violence
can
not
be
caressed
to
pity
,
because
absence
interposes
her
barrier
!
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
Feast
of
the
Assumption
;
no
school
was
held
.
<EOS>
The
boarders
and
teachers
,
after
attending
mass
in
the
morning
,
were
gone
a
long
walk
into
the
country
to
take
their
goûter
,
or
afternoon
meal
,
at
some
farm
-
house
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
go
with
them
,
for
now
but
two
days
remained
ere
the
_
Paul
et
<EOS>
Virginie
_
must
sail
,
and
I
was
clinging
to
my
last
chance
,
as
the
living
waif
of
a
wreck
clings
to
his
last
raft
or
cable
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
some
joiners
'
work
to
do
in
the
first
classe
,
some
bench
or
desk
to
repair
;
holidays
were
often
turned
to
account
for
the
performance
of
these
operations
,
which
could
not
be
executed
when
the
rooms
were
filled
with
pupils
.
<EOS>
As
I
sat
solitary
,
purposing
to
adjourn
to
the
garden
and
leave
the
coast
clear
,
but
too
listless
to
fulfil
my
own
intent
,
I
heard
the
workmen
coming
.
  
<EOS>
Foreign
artisans
and
servants
do
everything
by
couples
:
I
believe
it
would
take
two
Labassecourien
carpenters
to
drive
a
nail
.
<EOS>
While
tying
on
my
bonnet
,
which
had
hitherto
hung
by
its
ribbons
from
my
idle
hand
,
I
vaguely
and
momentarily
wondered
to
hear
the
step
of
but
one
"
ouvrier
.
<EOS>
"
I
noted
,
too
 
as
captives
in
dungeons
find
sometimes
dreary
leisure
to
note
the
merest
trifles
 
that
this
man
wore
shoes
,
and
not
sabots
:
<EOS>
I
concluded
that
it
must
be
the
master
-
carpenter
,
coming
to
inspect
before
he
sent
his
journeymen
.
<EOS>
I
threw
round
me
my
scarf
.
<EOS>
He
advanced
;
he
opened
the
door
;
my
back
was
towards
it
;
I
felt
a
little
thrill
 
<EOS>
a
curious
sensation
,
too
quick
and
transient
to
be
analyzed
.
<EOS>
I
turned
,
I
stood
in
the
supposed
master
-
artisan
's
presence
:
<EOS>
looking
towards
the
door
-
way
,
I
saw
it
filled
with
a
figure
,
and
my
eyes
printed
upon
my
brain
the
picture
of
M.
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
Hundreds
of
the
prayers
with
which
we
weary
Heaven
bring
to
the
suppliant
no
fulfilment
.
<EOS>
Once
haply
in
life
,
one
golden
gift
falls
prone
in
the
lap
 
<EOS>
one
boon
full
and
bright
,
perfect
from
Fruition
's
mint
.
  
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
wore
the
dress
in
which
he
probably
purposed
to
travel
 
a
surtout
,
guarded
with
velvet
;
I
thought
him
prepared
for
instant
departure
,
and
yet
I
had
understood
that
two
days
were
yet
to
run
before
the
ship
sailed
.
<EOS>
He
looked
well
and
cheerful
.
<EOS>
He
looked
kind
and
benign
:
he
came
in
with
eagerness
;
he
was
close
to
me
in
one
second
;
he
was
all
amity
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
his
bridegroom
mood
which
thus
brightened
him
.
<EOS>
Whatever
the
cause
,
I
could
not
meet
his
sunshine
with
cloud
.
<EOS>
If
this
were
my
last
moment
with
him
,
I
would
not
waste
it
in
forced
,
unnatural
distance
.
<EOS>
I
loved
him
well
 
<EOS>
too
well
not
to
smite
out
of
my
path
even
Jealousy
herself
,
when
she
would
have
obstructed
a
kind
farewell
.
<EOS>
A
cordial
word
from
his
lips
,
or
a
gentle
look
from
his
eyes
,
would
do
me
good
,
for
all
the
span
of
life
that
remained
to
me
;
it
would
be
comfort
in
the
last
strait
of
loneliness
;
I
would
take
it
 
<EOS>
I
would
taste
the
elixir
,
and
pride
should
not
spill
the
cup
.
  
<EOS>
The
interview
would
be
short
,
of
course
:
he
would
say
to
me
just
what
he
had
said
to
each
of
the
assembled
pupils
;
he
would
take
and
hold
my
hand
two
minutes
;
he
would
touch
my
cheek
with
his
lips
for
the
first
,
last
,
only
time
 
<EOS>
and
then
 
no
more
.
<EOS>
Then
,
indeed
,
the
final
parting
,
then
the
wide
separation
,
the
great
gulf
I
could
not
pass
to
go
to
him
 
across
which
,
haply
,
he
would
not
glance
,
to
remember
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
my
hand
in
one
of
his
,
with
the
other
he
put
back
my
bonnet
;
he
looked
into
my
face
,
his
luminous
smile
went
out
,
his
lips
expressed
something
almost
like
the
wordless
language
of
a
mother
who
finds
a
child
greatly
and
unexpectedly
changed
,
broken
with
illness
,
or
worn
out
by
want
.
<EOS>
A
check
supervened
.
  
<EOS>
"
Paul
,
Paul
!
"
said
a
woman
's
hurried
voice
behind
,
"
Paul
,
come
into
the
salon
;
I
have
yet
a
great
many
things
to
say
to
you
 
conversation
for
the
whole
day
 
<EOS>
and
so
has
Victor
;
and
Josef
is
here
.
<EOS>
Come
Paul
,
come
to
your
friends
.
"
  
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
,
brought
to
the
spot
by
vigilance
or
an
inscrutable
instinct
,
pressed
so
near
,
she
almost
thrust
herself
between
me
and
M.
Emanuel
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Paul
!
"
<EOS>
she
reiterated
,
her
eye
grazing
me
with
its
hard
ray
like
a
steel
stylet
.
<EOS>
She
pushed
against
her
kinsman
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
receded
;
I
thought
he
would
go
.
<EOS>
Pierced
deeper
than
I
could
endure
,
made
now
to
feel
what
defied
suppression
,
I
cried
    
"
My
heart
will
break
!
"
  
<EOS>
What
I
felt
seemed
literal
heart
-
break
;
but
the
seal
of
another
fountain
yielded
under
the
strain
:
one
breath
from
M.
Paul
,
the
whisper
,
"
Trust
me
!
<EOS>
"
lifted
a
load
,
opened
an
outlet
.
<EOS>
With
many
a
deep
sob
,
with
thrilling
,
with
icy
shiver
,
with
strong
trembling
,
and
yet
with
relief
 
<EOS>
I
wept
.
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
her
to
me
;
it
is
a
crisis
:
I
will
give
her
a
cordial
,
and
it
will
pass
,
"
said
the
calm
Madame
Beck
.
  
<EOS>
To
be
left
to
her
and
her
cordial
seemed
to
me
something
like
being
left
to
the
poisoner
and
her
bowl
.
<EOS>
When
M.
Paul
answered
deeply
,
harshly
,
and
briefly
 
"
Laissez
-
moi
!
"
<EOS>
in
the
grim
sound
I
felt
a
music
strange
,
strong
,
but
life
-
giving
.
  
<EOS>
"
Laissez
-
moi
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
,
his
nostrils
opening
,
and
his
facial
muscles
all
quivering
as
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
this
will
never
do
,
"
said
Madame
,
with
sternness
.
<EOS>
More
sternly
rejoined
her
kinsman
    
"
Sortez
d'ici
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
send
for
Père
Silas
:
on
the
spot
I
will
send
for
him
,
"
she
threatened
pertinaciously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Femme
!
"
cried
the
Professor
,
not
now
in
his
deep
tones
,
but
in
his
highest
and
most
excited
key
,
"
Femme
!
<EOS>
sortez
à
l'instant
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
roused
,
and
I
loved
him
in
his
wrath
with
a
passion
beyond
what
I
had
yet
felt
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
you
do
is
wrong
,
"
pursued
Madame
;
"
it
is
an
act
characteristic
of
men
of
your
unreliable
,
imaginative
temperament
;
a
step
impulsive
,
injudicious
,
inconsistent
 
a
proceeding
vexatious
,
and
not
estimable
in
the
view
of
persons
of
steadier
and
more
resolute
character
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
not
what
I
have
of
steady
and
resolute
in
me
,
"
said
he
,
"
<EOS>
but
you
shall
see
;
the
event
shall
teach
you
.
<EOS>
Modeste
,
"
he
continued
less
fiercely
,
"
be
gentle
,
be
pitying
,
be
a
woman
;
look
at
this
poor
face
,
and
relent
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
am
your
friend
,
and
the
friend
of
your
friends
;
in
spite
of
your
taunts
,
you
well
and
deeply
know
I
may
be
trusted
.
<EOS>
Of
sacrificing
myself
I
made
no
difficulty
but
my
heart
is
pained
by
what
I
see
;
it
_
must
_
have
and
give
solace
.
<EOS>
_
Leave
me
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
  
This
time
,
in
the
"
_
leave
me
_
<EOS>
"
there
was
an
intonation
so
bitter
and
so
imperative
,
I
wondered
that
even
Madame
Beck
herself
could
for
one
moment
delay
obedience
;
but
she
stood
firm
<EOS>
;
she
gazed
upon
him
dauntless
;
she
met
his
eye
,
forbidding
and
fixed
as
stone
.
<EOS>
She
was
opening
her
lips
to
retort
;
I
saw
over
all
M.
Paul
's
face
a
quick
rising
light
and
fire
;
I
can
hardly
tell
how
he
managed
the
movement
;
it
did
not
seem
violent
;
it
kept
the
form
of
courtesy
;
he
gave
his
hand
;
it
scarce
touched
her
<EOS>
I
thought
;
she
ran
,
she
whirled
from
the
room
;
she
was
gone
,
and
the
door
shut
,
in
one
second
.
  
<EOS>
The
flash
of
passion
was
all
over
very
soon
.
<EOS>
He
smiled
as
he
told
me
to
wipe
my
eyes
;
he
waited
quietly
till
I
was
calm
,
dropping
from
time
to
time
a
stilling
,
solacing
word
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
I
sat
beside
him
once
more
myself
 
re
-
assured
,
not
desperate
,
nor
yet
desolate
;
not
friendless
,
not
hopeless
,
not
sick
of
life
,
and
seeking
death
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
made
you
very
sad
then
to
lose
your
friend
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
kills
me
to
be
forgotten
,
Monsieur
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
All
these
weary
days
I
have
not
heard
from
you
one
word
,
and
I
was
crushed
with
the
possibility
,
growing
to
certainty
,
that
you
would
depart
without
saying
farewell
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Must
I
tell
you
what
I
told
Modeste
Beck
 
that
you
do
not
know
me
?
<EOS>
Must
I
show
and
teach
you
my
character
?
<EOS>
You
_
will
_
have
proof
that
I
can
be
a
firm
friend
?
<EOS>
Without
clear
proof
this
hand
will
not
lie
still
in
mine
,
it
will
not
trust
my
shoulder
as
a
safe
stay
?
<EOS>
Good
.
<EOS>
The
proof
is
ready
.
<EOS>
I
come
to
justify
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
anything
,
teach
anything
,
prove
anything
,
Monsieur
;
I
can
listen
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
in
the
first
place
,
you
must
go
out
with
me
a
good
distance
into
the
town
.
<EOS>
I
came
on
purpose
to
fetch
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Without
questioning
his
meaning
,
or
sounding
his
plan
,
or
offering
the
semblance
of
an
objection
,
I
re
-
tied
my
bonnet
:
I
was
ready
.
  
<EOS>
The
route
he
took
was
by
the
boulevards
:
he
several
times
made
me
sit
down
on
the
seats
stationed
under
the
lime
-
trees
;
he
did
not
ask
if
I
was
tired
,
but
looked
,
and
drew
his
own
conclusions
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
these
weary
days
,
"
said
he
,
repeating
my
words
,
with
a
gentle
,
kindly
mimicry
of
my
voice
and
foreign
accent
,
not
new
from
his
lips
,
and
of
which
the
playful
banter
never
wounded
,
not
even
when
coupled
,
as
it
often
was
,
with
the
assertion
,
that
however
I
might
_
write
_
<EOS>
his
language
<EOS>
,
I
_
spoke
_
and
always
should
speak
it
imperfectly
and
hesitatingly
.
"
<EOS>
"
All
these
weary
days
'
I
have
not
for
one
hour
forgotten
you
.
<EOS>
Faithful
women
err
in
this
,
that
they
think
themselves
the
sole
faithful
of
God
's
creatures
.
<EOS>
On
a
very
fervent
and
living
truth
to
myself
,
I
,
too
,
till
lately
scarce
dared
count
,
from
any
quarter
;
but
 
look
at
me
.
"
<EOS>
,
  
I
lifted
my
happy
eyes
:
they
_
were
_
happy
now
,
or
they
would
have
been
no
interpreters
of
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
he
,
after
some
seconds
'
scrutiny
,
"
there
is
no
denying
that
signature
<EOS>
:
Constancy
wrote
it
:
<EOS>
her
pen
is
of
iron
.
<EOS>
Was
the
record
painful
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Severely
painful
,
"
I
said
,
with
truth
.
<EOS>
"
Withdraw
her
hand
,
Monsieur
;
I
can
bear
its
inscribing
force
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Elle
est
toute
pâle
,
"
said
he
,
speaking
to
himself
;
"
cette
figure
-
<EOS>
là
me
fait
mal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
am
not
pleasant
to
look
at
 
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
saying
this
;
the
words
came
unbidden
:
<EOS>
I
never
remember
the
time
when
I
had
not
a
haunting
dread
of
what
might
be
the
degree
of
my
outward
deficiency
;
this
dread
pressed
me
at
the
moment
with
special
force
.
  
<EOS>
A
great
softness
passed
upon
his
countenance
;
his
violet
eyes
grew
suffused
and
glistening
under
their
deep
Spanish
lashes
<EOS>
:
he
started
up
;
"
Let
us
walk
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
displease
your
eyes
_
much
_
?
<EOS>
"
I
took
courage
to
urge
:
the
point
had
its
vital
import
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
and
gave
me
a
short
,
strong
answer
;
an
answer
which
silenced
,
subdued
,
yet
profoundly
satisfied
.
<EOS>
Ever
after
that
I
knew
what
I
was
for
_
him
_
;
and
what
I
might
be
for
the
rest
of
the
world
,
I
ceased
painfully
to
care
.
<EOS>
Was
it
weak
to
lay
so
much
stress
on
an
opinion
about
appearance
?
<EOS>
I
fear
it
might
be
;
I
fear
it
was
;
but
in
that
case
I
must
avow
no
light
share
of
weakness
.
<EOS>
I
must
own
great
fear
of
displeasing
 
a
strong
wish
moderately
to
please
M.
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
Whither
we
rambled
,
I
scarce
knew
.
<EOS>
Our
walk
was
long
,
yet
seemed
short
;
the
path
was
pleasant
,
the
day
lovely
.
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
talked
of
his
voyage
 
<EOS>
he
thought
of
staying
away
three
years
.
<EOS>
On
his
return
from
Guadaloupe
,
he
looked
forward
to
release
from
liabilities
and
a
clear
course
;
and
what
did
I
purpose
doing
in
the
interval
of
his
absence
?
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
I
had
talked
once
,
he
reminded
me
,
of
trying
to
be
independent
and
keeping
a
little
school
of
my
own
:
had
I
dropped
the
idea
?
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
I
had
not
:
I
was
doing
my
best
to
save
what
would
enable
me
to
put
it
in
practice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
not
like
leaving
me
in
the
Rue
Fossette
;
he
feared
I
should
miss
him
there
too
much
 
<EOS>
I
should
feel
desolate
 
<EOS>
I
should
grow
sad
 
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
certain
;
but
I
promised
to
do
my
best
to
endure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Still
,
"
said
he
,
speaking
low
,
"
there
is
another
objection
to
your
present
residence
.
<EOS>
I
should
wish
to
write
to
you
sometimes
:
it
would
not
be
well
to
have
any
uncertainty
about
the
safe
transmission
of
letters
;
and
in
the
Rue
Fossette
 
in
short
,
our
Catholic
discipline
in
certain
matters
 
though
justifiable
and
expedient
 
might
possibly
,
under
peculiar
circumstances
,
become
liable
to
misapplication
 
perhaps
abuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
write
,
"
said
I
,
"
I
_
must
_
have
your
letters
;
and
I
_
will
_
have
them
:
ten
directors
,
twenty
directresses
,
shall
not
keep
them
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
Protestant
:
I
will
not
bear
that
kind
of
discipline
:
<EOS>
Monsieur
,
I
_
will
not
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Doucement
 
doucement
,
"
rejoined
he
;
"
we
will
contrive
a
plan
;
we
have
our
resources
:
soyez
tranquille
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
speaking
,
he
paused
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
now
returning
from
the
long
walk
.
<EOS>
We
had
reached
the
middle
of
a
clean
Faubourg
,
where
the
houses
were
small
,
but
looked
pleasant
.
<EOS>
It
was
before
the
white
door
-
step
of
a
very
neat
abode
that
M.
Paul
had
halted
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
call
here
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
knock
,
but
taking
from
his
pocket
a
key
,
he
opened
and
entered
at
once
.
<EOS>
Ushering
me
in
,
he
shut
the
door
behind
us
.
<EOS>
No
servant
appeared
.
<EOS>
The
vestibule
was
small
,
like
the
house
,
but
freshly
and
tastefully
painted
;
its
vista
closed
in
a
French
window
with
vines
trained
about
the
panes
,
tendrils
,
and
green
leaves
kissing
the
glass
.
<EOS>
Silence
reigned
in
this
dwelling
.
  
<EOS>
Opening
an
inner
door
,
M.
Paul
disclosed
a
parlour
,
or
salon
 
very
tiny
,
but
I
thought
,
very
pretty
.
<EOS>
Its
delicate
walls
were
tinged
like
a
blush
;
its
floor
was
waxed
;
a
square
of
brilliant
carpet
covered
its
centre
;
its
small
round
table
shone
like
the
mirror
over
its
hearth
;
there
was
a
little
couch
,
a
little
chiffonnière
,
the
half
-
open
,
crimson
-
silk
door
of
which
,
showed
porcelain
on
the
shelves
;
there
was
a
French
clock
,
a
lamp
;
there
were
ornaments
in
biscuit
china
;
the
recess
of
the
single
ample
window
was
filled
with
a
green
stand
,
bearing
three
green
flower
-
pots
,
each
filled
with
a
fine
plant
glowing
in
bloom
;
in
one
corner
appeared
a
guéridon
with
a
marble
top
,
and
upon
it
a
work
-
box
,
and
a
glass
filled
with
violets
in
water
.
<EOS>
The
lattice
of
this
room
was
open
;
the
outer
air
breathing
through
,
gave
freshness
,
the
sweet
violets
lent
fragrance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
,
pretty
place
!
"
said
I.
M.
Paul
smiled
to
see
me
so
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
"
Must
we
sit
down
here
and
wait
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
in
a
whisper
,
half
awed
by
the
deep
pervading
hush
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
first
peep
into
one
or
two
other
nooks
of
this
nutshell
,
"
he
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dare
<EOS>
you
take
the
freedom
of
going
all
over
the
house
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
dare
,
"
said
he
,
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
He
led
the
way
.
<EOS>
I
was
shown
a
little
kitchen
with
a
little
stove
and
oven
,
with
few
but
bright
brasses
,
two
chairs
and
a
table
.
<EOS>
A
small
cupboard
held
a
diminutive
but
commodious
set
of
earthenware
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
coffee
service
of
china
in
the
salon
,
"
said
M.
Paul
,
as
I
looked
at
the
six
green
and
white
dinner
-
plates
;
the
four
dishes
,
the
cups
and
jugs
to
match
.
  
<EOS>
Conducted
up
the
narrow
but
clean
staircase
,
I
was
permitted
a
glimpse
of
two
pretty
cabinets
of
sleeping
-
rooms
;
finally
,
I
was
once
more
led
below
,
and
we
halted
with
a
certain
ceremony
before
a
larger
door
than
had
yet
been
opened
.
  
<EOS>
Producing
a
second
key
,
M.
Emanuel
adjusted
it
to
the
lock
of
this
door
.
<EOS>
He
opened
,
put
me
in
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Voici
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
myself
in
a
good
-
sized
apartment
,
scrupulously
clean
,
though
bare
,
compared
with
those
I
had
hitherto
seen
.
<EOS>
The
well
-
scoured
boards
were
carpetless
;
it
contained
two
rows
of
green
benches
and
desks
,
with
an
alley
down
the
centre
,
terminating
in
an
estrade
,
a
teacher
's
chair
and
table
;
behind
them
a
tableau
,
On
the
walls
hung
two
maps
;
in
the
windows
flowered
a
few
hardy
plants
;
in
short
,
here
was
a
miniature
classe
 
complete
,
neat
,
pleasant
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
school
then
?
"
said
I.
"
<EOS>
Who
keeps
it
?
<EOS>
I
never
heard
of
an
establishment
in
this
faubourg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
have
the
goodness
to
accept
of
a
few
prospectuses
for
distribution
in
behalf
of
a
friend
of
mine
?
"
asked
he
,
taking
from
his
surtout
-
pocket
some
quires
of
these
documents
,
and
putting
them
into
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
looked
,
I
read
 
printed
in
fair
characters
:
    
"
Externat
de
demoiselles
.
<EOS>
Numéro
7
,
Faubourg
Clotilde
,
Directrice
,
Mademoiselle
Lucy
Snowe
.
"
     
<EOS>
And
what
did
I
say
to
M.
Paul
Emanuel
?
  
<EOS>
Certain
junctures
of
our
lives
must
always
be
difficult
of
recall
to
memory
.
<EOS>
Certain
points
,
crises
,
certain
feelings
,
joys
,
griefs
,
and
amazements
,
when
reviewed
,
must
strike
us
as
things
wildered
and
whirling
,
dim
as
a
wheel
fast
spun
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
no
more
remember
the
thoughts
or
the
words
of
the
ten
minutes
succeeding
this
disclosure
,
than
I
can
retrace
the
experience
of
my
earliest
year
of
life
:
and
yet
the
first
thing
distinct
to
me
is
the
consciousness
that
I
was
speaking
very
fast
,
repeating
over
and
over
again
:
    
<EOS>
"
Did
you
do
this
,
M.
Paul
?
<EOS>
Is
this
your
house
?
<EOS>
Did
you
furnish
it
?
<EOS>
Did
you
get
these
papers
printed
?
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
me
?
<EOS>
Am
I
the
directress
?
<EOS>
Is
there
another
Lucy
Snowe
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
:
say
something
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
he
would
not
speak
.
<EOS>
His
pleased
silence
,
his
laughing
down
-
look
,
his
attitude
,
are
visible
to
me
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
it
?
<EOS>
I
must
know
all
 
_
<EOS>
all
_
,
"
I
cried
.
  
<EOS>
The
packet
of
papers
fell
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
He
had
extended
his
hand
,
and
I
had
fastened
thereon
,
oblivious
of
all
else
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
said
I
had
forgotten
you
all
these
weary
days
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Poor
old
Emanuel
!
<EOS>
These
are
the
thanks
he
gets
for
trudging
about
three
mortal
weeks
from
house
-
painter
to
upholsterer
,
from
cabinet
-
maker
to
charwoman
.
<EOS>
Lucy
and
Lucy
's
cot
,
the
sole
thoughts
in
his
head
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
knew
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
first
caressed
the
soft
velvet
on
his
cuff
,
and
then
.
<EOS>
I
stroked
the
hand
it
surrounded
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
foresight
,
his
goodness
,
his
silent
,
strong
,
effective
goodness
,
that
overpowered
me
by
their
proved
reality
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
assurance
of
his
sleepless
interest
which
broke
on
me
like
a
light
from
heaven
;
it
was
his
 
I
will
dare
to
say
it
 
<EOS>
his
fond
,
tender
look
,
which
now
shook
me
indescribably
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
all
I
forced
myself
to
look
at
the
practical
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
trouble
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
,
"
and
the
cost
!
<EOS>
Had
you
money
,
M.
Paul
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Plenty
of
money
!
"
said
he
heartily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
disposal
of
my
large
teaching
connection
put
me
in
possession
of
a
handsome
sum
with
part
of
it
<EOS>
I
determined
to
give
myself
the
richest
treat
that
I
_
have
_
known
or
_
<EOS>
shall
_
know
.
<EOS>
I
like
this
.
<EOS>
I
have
reckoned
on
this
hour
day
and
night
lately
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
come
near
you
,
because
I
would
not
forestall
it
.
<EOS>
Reserve
is
neither
my
virtue
nor
my
vice
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
put
myself
into
your
power
,
and
you
had
begun
with
your
questions
of
look
and
lip
 
<EOS>
Where
have
you
been
,
M.
Paul
?
<EOS>
What
have
you
been
doing
?
<EOS>
What
is
your
mystery
?
 
<EOS>
my
solitary
first
and
last
secret
would
presently
have
unravelled
itself
in
your
lap
.
<EOS>
Now
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
you
shall
live
here
and
have
a
school
;
you
shall
employ
yourself
while
I
am
away
;
you
shall
think
of
me
sometimes
;
you
shall
mind
your
health
and
happiness
for
my
sake
,
and
when
I
come
back
 
"
  
<EOS>
There
he
left
a
blank
.
  
<EOS>
I
promised
to
do
all
he
told
me
.
<EOS>
I
promised
to
work
hard
and
willingly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
your
faithful
steward
<EOS>
,
"
I
said
;
"
I
trust
at
your
coming
the
account
will
be
ready
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
,
monsieur
,
you
are
_
too
_
good
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
such
inadequate
language
my
feelings
struggled
for
expression
:
they
could
not
get
it
;
speech
,
brittle
and
unmalleable
,
and
cold
as
ice
,
dissolved
or
shivered
in
the
effort
.
<EOS>
He
watched
me
,
still
;
he
gently
raised
his
hand
to
stroke
my
hair
;
it
touched
my
lips
in
passing
;
I
pressed
it
close
,
I
paid
it
tribute
.
<EOS>
He
was
my
king
;
royal
for
me
had
been
that
hand
's
bounty
;
to
offer
homage
was
both
a
joy
and
a
duty
.
     
<EOS>
The
afternoon
hours
were
over
,
and
the
stiller
time
of
evening
shaded
the
quiet
faubourg
.
<EOS>
M.
Paul
claimed
my
hospitality
;
occupied
and
afoot
since
morning
,
he
needed
refreshment
;
he
said
I
should
offer
him
chocolate
in
my
pretty
gold
and
white
china
service
.
<EOS>
He
went
out
and
ordered
what
was
needful
from
the
restaurant
;
he
placed
the
small
guéridon
and
two
chairs
in
the
balcony
outside
the
French
window
under
the
screening
vines
.
<EOS>
With
what
shy
joy
i
accepted
my
part
as
hostess
,
arranged
the
salver
,
served
the
benefactor
-
guest
.
  
<EOS>
This
balcony
was
in
the
rear
of
the
house
,
the
gardens
of
the
faubourg
were
round
us
,
<EOS>
fields
extended
beyond
.
<EOS>
The
air
was
still
,
mild
,
and
fresh
.
<EOS>
Above
the
poplars
,
the
laurels
,
the
cypresses
,
and
the
roses
,
looked
up
a
moon
so
lovely
and
so
halcyon
,
the
heart
trembled
under
her
smile
;
a
star
shone
subject
beside
her
,
with
the
unemulous
ray
of
pure
love
.
<EOS>
In
a
large
garden
near
us
,
a
jet
rose
from
a
well
,
and
a
pale
statue
leaned
over
the
play
of
waters
.
  
<EOS>
M.
Paul
talked
to
me
.
<EOS>
His
voice
was
so
modulated
that
it
mixed
harmonious
with
the
silver
whisper
,
the
gush
,
the
musical
sigh
,
in
which
light
breeze
,
fountain
and
foliage
intoned
their
lulling
vesper
:
  
<EOS>
Happy
hour
 
stay
one
moment
!
<EOS>
droop
those
plumes
,
rest
those
wings
;
incline
to
mine
that
brow
of
Heaven
!
<EOS>
White
Angel
!
<EOS>
let
thy
light
linger
;
leave
its
reflection
on
succeeding
clouds
;
bequeath
its
cheer
to
that
time
which
needs
a
ray
in
retrospect
!
  
<EOS>
Our
meal
was
simple
:
the
chocolate
,
the
rolls
,
the
plate
of
fresh
summer
fruit
,
cherries
and
strawberries
bedded
in
green
leaves
formed
the
whole
:
but
it
was
what
we
both
liked
better
than
a
feast
,
and
I
took
a
delight
inexpressible
in
tending
M.
Paul
.
<EOS>
I
asked
him
whether
his
friends
,
Père
Silas
and
Madame
Beck
,
knew
what
he
had
done
 
whether
they
had
seen
my
house
?
  
<EOS>
"
Mon
amie
,
"
said
he
,
"
none
knows
what
I
have
done
save
you
and
myself
:
the
pleasure
is
consecrated
to
us
two
,
unshared
and
unprofaned
.
<EOS>
To
speak
truth
,
there
has
been
to
me
in
this
matter
a
refinement
of
enjoyment
I
would
not
make
vulgar
by
communication
.
<EOS>
Besides
"
(
smiling
)
"
I
wanted
to
prove
to
Miss
Lucy
that
I
_
<EOS>
could
_
keep
a
secret
.
<EOS>
How
often
has
she
taunted
me
with
lack
of
dignified
reserve
and
needful
caution
!
<EOS>
How
many
times
has
she
saucily
insinuated
that
all
my
affairs
are
the
secret
of
Polichinelle
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
true
enough
:
I
had
not
spared
him
on
this
point
,
nor
perhaps
on
any
other
that
was
assailable
.
<EOS>
Magnificent
-
minded
,
grand
-
hearted
,
dear
,
faulty
little
man
!
<EOS>
You
deserved
candour
,
and
from
me
always
had
it
.
  
<EOS>
Continuing
my
queries
,
I
asked
to
whom
the
house
belonged
,
who
was
my
landlord
,
the
amount
of
my
rent
.
<EOS>
He
instantly
gave
me
these
particulars
in
writing
;
he
had
foreseen
and
prepared
all
things
.
  
<EOS>
The
house
was
not
M.
Paul
's
 
that
I
guessed
:
he
was
hardly
the
man
to
become
a
proprietor
;
I
more
than
suspected
in
him
a
lamentable
absence
of
the
saving
faculty
;
he
could
get
,
but
not
keep
;
he
needed
a
treasurer
.
<EOS>
The
tenement
,
then
,
belonged
to
a
citizen
in
the
Basse
-
Ville
 
<EOS>
a
man
of
substance
,
M.
Paul
said
;
he
startled
me
by
adding
:
"
a
friend
of
yours
,
Miss
Lucy
,
a
person
who
has
a
most
respectful
regard
for
you
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
to
my
pleasant
surprise
,
I
found
the
landlord
was
none
other
than
M.
Miret
,
the
short
-
tempered
and
kind
-
hearted
bookseller
,
who
had
so
kindly
found
me
a
seat
<EOS>
that
eventful
night
in
the
park
.
<EOS>
It
seems
M.
Miret
was
,
in
his
station
,
rich
,
as
well
as
much
respected
,
and
possessed
several
houses
in
this
faubourg
;
the
rent
was
moderate
,
scarce
half
of
what
it
would
have
been
for
a
house
of
equal
size
nearer
the
centre
of
Villette
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
,
"
observed
M.
Paul
,
"
should
fortune
not
favour
you
,
though
I
think
she
will
,
I
have
the
satisfaction
to
think
you
are
in
good
hands
;
M.
Miret
will
not
be
extortionate
:
the
first
year
's
rent
you
have
already
in
your
savings
;
afterwards
Miss
Lucy
must
trust
God
,
and
herself
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
what
will
you
do
for
pupils
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
distribute
my
prospectuses
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Right
!
<EOS>
By
way
of
losing
no
time
,
I
gave
one
to
M.
Miret
yesterday
.
<EOS>
Should
you
object
to
beginning
with
three
petite
bourgeoises
,
the
Demoiselles
Miret
?
<EOS>
They
are
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
you
forget
nothing
;
you
are
wonderful
.
<EOS>
Object
?
<EOS>
It
would
become
me
indeed
to
object
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
hardly
expect
at
the
outset
to
number
aristocrats
in
my
little
day
-
school
;
I
care
not
if
they
never
come
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
proud
to
receive
M.
Miret
's
daughters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Besides
these
,
"
pursued
he
,
"
another
pupil
offers
,
who
will
come
daily
to
take
lessons
in
English
;
and
as
she
is
rich
,
she
will
pay
handsomely
.
<EOS>
I
mean
my
god
-
daughter
and
ward
,
Justine
Marie
Sauveur
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
is
in
a
name
?
 
<EOS>
what
in
three
words
?
<EOS>
Till
this
moment
I
had
listened
with
living
joy
 
<EOS>
I
had
answered
with
gleeful
quickness
;
a
name
froze
me
;
three
words
struck
me
mute
.
<EOS>
The
effect
could
not
be
hidden
,
and
indeed
I
scarce
tried
to
hide
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
now
?
"
said
M.
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nothing
!
<EOS>
Your
countenance
changes
:
your
colour
and
your
very
eyes
fade
.
<EOS>
Nothing
!
<EOS>
You
must
be
ill
;
you
have
some
suffering
;
tell
me
what
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
nothing
to
tell
.
  
<EOS>
He
drew
his
chair
nearer
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
grow
vexed
,
though
I
continued
silent
and
icy
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
win
a
word
;
he
entreated
with
perseverance
,
he
waited
with
patience
.
  
<EOS>
"
Justine
Marie
is
a
good
girl
,
"
said
he
,
"
docile
and
amiable
;
<EOS>
not
quick
 
<EOS>
but
you
will
like
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
must
not
come
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Such
was
my
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
wish
to
puzzle
me
?
<EOS>
Do
you
know
her
?
<EOS>
But
,
in
truth
,
there
_
is
_
something
.
<EOS>
Again
you
are
pale
as
that
statue
.
<EOS>
Rely
on
Paul
Carlos
;
tell
him
the
grief
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
chair
touched
mine
;
his
hand
,
quietly
advanced
,
turned
me
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
Marie
Justine
?
"
said
he
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
name
re
-
pronounced
by
his
lips
overcame
me
unaccountably
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
prostrate
 
no
,
it
stirred
me
up
,
running
with
haste
and
heat
through
my
veins
 
recalling
an
hour
of
quick
pain
,
many
days
and
nights
of
heart
-
sickness
.
<EOS>
Near
me
as
he
now
sat
,
strongly
and
closely
as
he
had
long
twined
his
life
in
mine
 
far
as
had
progressed
,
and
near
as
was
achieved
our
minds
'
and
affections
'
assimilation
 
the
very
suggestion
of
interference
,
of
heart
-
separation
,
could
be
heard
only
with
a
fermenting
excitement
,
an
impetuous
throe
,
a
disdainful
resolve
,
an
ire
,
a
resistance
of
which
no
human
eye
or
cheek
could
hide
the
flame
,
nor
any
truth
-
accustomed
human
tongue
curb
the
cry
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
tell
you
something
,
"
I
said
:
"
I
want
to
tell
you
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
,
Lucy
;
come
near
;
speak
.
<EOS>
Who
prizes
you
,
if
I
do
not
?
<EOS>
Who
is
your
friend
,
if
not
Emanuel
?
<EOS>
Speak
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
spoke
.
<EOS>
All
escaped
from
my
lips
.
<EOS>
I
lacked
not
words
now
;
fast
I
narrated
;
fluent
I
told
my
tale
;
it
streamed
on
my
tongue
.
<EOS>
I
went
back
to
the
night
in
the
park
;
I
mentioned
the
medicated
draught
 
why
it
was
given
 
its
goading
effect
 
how
it
had
torn
rest
from
under
my
head
,
shaken
me
from
my
couch
,
carried
me
abroad
with
the
lure
of
a
vivid
yet
solemn
fancy
 
a
summer
-
night
solitude
on
turf
,
under
trees
,
near
a
deep
,
cool
lakelet
.
<EOS>
I
told
the
scene
realized
;
the
crowd
,
the
masques
,
the
music
,
the
lamps
,
the
splendours
,
the
guns
booming
afar
,
the
bells
sounding
on
high
.
<EOS>
All
I
had
encountered
I
detailed
,
all
I
had
recognised
,
heard
,
and
seen
;
how
I
had
beheld
and
watched
himself
:
how
I
listened
,
how
much
heard
,
what
conjectured
;
<EOS>
the
whole
history
,
in
brief
,
summoned
to
his
confidence
,
rushed
thither
,
truthful
,
literal
,
ardent
,
bitter
.
  
<EOS>
Still
as
I
narrated
,
instead
of
checking
,
he
incited
me
to
proceed
he
spurred
me
by
the
gesture
,
the
smile
,
the
half
-
word
.
<EOS>
Before
I
had
half
done
,
he
held
both
my
hands
,
he
consulted
my
eyes
with
a
most
piercing
glance
:
there
was
something
in
his
face
which
tended
neither
to
calm
nor
to
put
me
down
;
he
forgot
his
own
doctrine
,
he
forsook
his
own
system
of
repression
when
I
most
challenged
its
exercise
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
deserved
strong
reproof
;
but
when
have
we
our
deserts
?
<EOS>
I
merited
severity
;
he
looked
indulgence
.
<EOS>
To
my
very
self
I
seemed
imperious
and
unreasonable
,
for
I
forbade
Justine
Marie
my
door
and
roof
;
he
smiled
,
betraying
delight
.
<EOS>
Warm
,
jealous
,
and
haughty
<EOS>
,
I
knew
not
till
now
that
my
nature
had
such
a
mood
:
he
gathered
me
near
his
heart
.
<EOS>
I
was
full
of
faults
;
he
took
them
and
me
all
home
.
<EOS>
For
the
moment
of
utmost
mutiny
,
he
reserved
the
one
deep
spell
of
peace
.
<EOS>
These
words
caressed
my
ear
:
    
"
Lucy
,
take
my
love
.
<EOS>
One
day
share
my
life
.
<EOS>
Be
my
dearest
,
first
on
earth
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
walked
back
to
the
Rue
Fossette
by
moonlight
 
such
moonlight
as
fell
on
Eden
 
shining
through
the
shades
of
the
Great
Garden
,
and
haply
gilding
a
path
glorious
for
a
step
divine
 
a
Presence
nameless
.
<EOS>
Once
in
their
lives
some
men
and
women
go
back
to
these
first
fresh
days
of
our
great
Sire
and
Mother
 
<EOS>
taste
that
grand
morning
's
dew
 
bathe
in
its
sunrise
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
walk
I
was
told
how
Justine
Marie
Sauveur
had
always
been
regarded
with
the
affection
proper
to
a
daughter
 
<EOS>
how
,
with
M.
Paul
's
consent
,
she
had
been
affianced
for
months
to
one
Heinrich
Mühler
,
a
wealthy
young
German
merchant
,
and
was
to
be
married
in
the
course
of
a
year
.
<EOS>
Some
of
M.
Emanuel
's
relations
and
connections
would
,
indeed
,
it
seems
,
have
liked
him
to
marry
her
,
with
a
view
to
securing
her
fortune
in
the
family
;
but
to
himself
the
scheme
was
repugnant
,
and
the
idea
totally
inadmissible
.
  
<EOS>
We
reached
Madame
Beck
's
door
.
<EOS>
Jean
Baptiste
's
clock
tolled
nine
.
<EOS>
At
this
hour
,
in
this
house
,
eighteen
months
since
,
had
this
man
at
my
side
bent
before
me
,
looked
into
my
face
and
eyes
,
and
arbitered
my
destiny
.
<EOS>
This
very
evening
he
had
again
stooped
,
gazed
,
and
decreed
.
<EOS>
How
different
the
look
 
<EOS>
how
far
otherwise
the
fate
!
  
<EOS>
He
deemed
me
born
under
his
star
:
he
seemed
to
have
spread
over
me
its
beam
like
a
banner
.
<EOS>
Once
 
unknown
,
and
unloved
,
I
held
him
harsh
and
strange
;
the
low
stature
,
the
wiry
make
,
the
angles
,
the
darkness
,
the
manner
,
displeased
me
.
<EOS>
Now
,
penetrated
with
his
influence
,
and
living
by
his
affection
,
having
his
worth
by
intellect
,
and
his
goodness
by
heart
 
<EOS>
I
preferred
him
before
all
humanity
.
  
<EOS>
We
parted
:
he
gave
me
his
pledge
,
and
then
his
farewell
.
<EOS>
We
parted
:
the
next
day
 
he
sailed
.
    
<EOS>
FINIS
.
  
<EOS>
Man
can
not
prophesy
.
<EOS>
Love
is
no
oracle
.
<EOS>
Fear
sometimes
imagines
a
vain
thing
.
<EOS>
Those
years
of
absence
!
<EOS>
How
had
I
sickened
over
their
anticipation
!
<EOS>
The
woe
they
must
bring
seemed
certain
as
death
.
<EOS>
I
knew
the
nature
of
their
course
:
<EOS>
I
never
had
doubt
how
it
would
harrow
as
it
went
.
<EOS>
The
juggernaut
on
his
car
towered
there
a
grim
load
.
<EOS>
Seeing
him
draw
nigh
,
burying
his
broad
wheels
in
the
oppressed
soil
 
I
,
the
prostrate
votary
 
felt
beforehand
the
annihilating
craunch
.
  
<EOS>
Strange
to
say
 
strange
,
yet
true
,
and
owning
many
parallels
in
life
's
experience
 
that
anticipatory
craunch
proved
all
 
<EOS>
yes
 
<EOS>
nearly
_
<EOS>
all
_
<EOS>
the
torture
.
<EOS>
The
great
Juggernaut
,
in
his
great
chariot
,
drew
on
lofty
,
loud
,
and
sullen
.
<EOS>
He
passed
quietly
,
like
a
shadow
sweeping
the
sky
,
at
noon
.
<EOS>
Nothing
but
a
chilling
dimness
was
seen
or
felt
.
<EOS>
I
looked
up
.
<EOS>
Chariot
and
demon
charioteer
were
gone
by
;
the
votary
still
lived
.
  
<EOS>
M.
Emanuel
was
away
three
years
.
<EOS>
Reader
,
they
were
the
three
happiest
years
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
Do
you
scout
the
paradox
?
<EOS>
Listen
.
<EOS>
I
commenced
my
school
;
I
worked
 
<EOS>
I
worked
hard
.
<EOS>
I
deemed
myself
the
steward
of
his
property
,
and
determined
,
God
willing
,
to
render
a
good
account
.
<EOS>
Pupils
came
 
burghers
at
first
 
a
higher
class
ere
long
.
<EOS>
About
the
middle
of
the
second
year
an
unexpected
chance
threw
into
my
hands
an
additional
hundred
pounds
:
one
day
I
received
from
England
a
letter
containing
that
sum
.
<EOS>
It
came
from
Mr.
Marchmont
,
the
cousin
and
heir
of
my
dear
and
dead
mistress
.
<EOS>
He
was
just
recovering
from
a
dangerous
illness
;
the
money
was
a
peace
-
offering
to
his
conscience
,
reproaching
him
in
the
matter
of
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
what
,
papers
or
memoranda
found
after
his
kinswoman
's
death
 
naming
or
recommending
Lucy
Snowe
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Barrett
had
given
him
my
address
.
<EOS>
How
far
his
conscience
had
been
sinned
against
,
I
never
inquired
.
<EOS>
I
asked
no
questions
,
but
took
the
cash
and
made
it
useful
.
  
<EOS>
With
this
hundred
pounds
I
ventured
to
take
the
house
adjoining
mine
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
leave
that
which
M.
Paul
had
chosen
,
in
which
he
had
left
,
and
where
he
expected
again
to
find
me
.
<EOS>
My
externat
became
a
pensionnat
;
that
also
prospered
.
  
<EOS>
The
secret
of
my
success
did
not
lie
so
much
in
myself
,
in
any
endowment
,
any
power
of
mine
,
as
in
a
new
state
of
circumstances
,
a
wonderfully
changed
life
,
a
relieved
heart
.
<EOS>
The
spring
which
moved
my
energies
lay
far
away
beyond
seas
,
in
an
Indian
isle
.
<EOS>
At
parting
,
I
had
been
left
a
legacy
;
such
a
thought
for
the
present
,
such
a
hope
for
the
future
,
such
a
motive
for
a
persevering
,
a
laborious
,
an
enterprising
,
a
patient
and
a
brave
course
 
<EOS>
I
_
<EOS>
could
_
not
flag
.
<EOS>
Few
things
shook
me
now
;
few
things
had
importance
to
vex
,
intimidate
,
or
depress
me
:
most
things
pleased
 
<EOS>
mere
trifles
had
a
charm
.
  
<EOS>
Do
not
think
that
this
genial
flame
sustained
itself
,
or
lived
wholly
on
a
bequeathed
hope
or
a
parting
promise
.
<EOS>
A
generous
provider
supplied
bounteous
fuel
.
<EOS>
I
was
spared
all
chill
,
all
stint
;
I
was
not
suffered
to
fear
penury
;
I
was
not
tried
with
suspense
.
<EOS>
By
every
vessel
he
wrote
;
he
wrote
as
he
gave
and
as
he
loved
,
in
full
-
handed
,
full
-
hearted
plenitude
.
<EOS>
He
wrote
because
he
liked
to
write
;
he
did
not
abridge
,
because
he
cared
not
to
abridge
.
<EOS>
He
sat
down
,
he
took
pen
and
paper
,
because
he
loved
Lucy
and
had
much
to
say
to
her
;
because
he
was
faithful
and
thoughtful
,
because
he
was
tender
and
true
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
sham
and
no
cheat
,
and
no
hollow
unreal
in
him
.
<EOS>
Apology
never
dropped
her
slippery
oil
on
his
lips
 
never
proffered
,
by
his
pen
,
her
coward
feints
and
paltry
nullities
:
he
would
give
neither
a
stone
,
nor
an
excuse
 
neither
a
scorpion
;
nor
a
disappointment
;
his
letters
were
real
food
that
nourished
,
living
water
that
refreshed
.
  
<EOS>
And
was
I
grateful
?
<EOS>
God
knows
!
<EOS>
I
believe
that
scarce
a
living
being
so
remembered
,
so
sustained
,
dealt
with
in
kind
so
constant
,
honourable
and
noble
,
could
be
otherwise
than
grateful
to
the
death
.
  
<EOS>
Adherent
to
his
own
religion
(
in
him
was
not
the
stuff
of
which
is
made
the
facile
apostate
)
<EOS>
,
he
freely
left
me
my
pure
faith
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
tease
nor
tempt
.
<EOS>
He
said
:
    
"
Remain
a
Protestant
.
<EOS>
My
little
English
Puritan
,
I
love
Protestantism
in
you
.
<EOS>
I
own
its
severe
charm
.
<EOS>
There
is
something
in
its
ritual
I
can
not
receive
myself
,
but
it
is
the
sole
creed
for
"
Lucy
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
All
Rome
could
not
put
into
him
bigotry
,
nor
the
Propaganda
itself
make
him
a
real
Jesuit
.
<EOS>
He
was
born
honest
,
and
not
false
 
artless
,
and
not
cunning
 
a
freeman
,
and
not
a
slave
.
<EOS>
His
tenderness
had
rendered
him
ductile
in
a
priest
's
hands
,
his
affection
,
his
devotedness
,
his
sincere
pious
enthusiasm
blinded
his
kind
eyes
sometimes
,
made
him
abandon
justice
to
himself
to
do
the
work
of
craft
,
and
serve
the
ends
of
selfishness
;
but
these
are
faults
so
rare
to
find
,
so
costly
to
their
owner
to
indulge
,
we
scarce
know
whether
they
will
not
one
day
be
reckoned
amongst
the
jewels
.
     
<EOS>
And
now
the
three
years
are
past
:
M.
Emanuel
's
return
is
fixed
.
<EOS>
It
is
Autumn
;
he
is
to
be
with
me
ere
the
mists
of
November
come
.
<EOS>
My
school
flourishes
,
my
house
is
ready
:
I
have
made
him
a
little
library
,
filled
its
shelves
with
the
books
he
left
in
my
care
:
I
have
cultivated
out
of
love
for
him
<EOS>
(
I
was
naturally
no
florist
)
<EOS>
the
plants
he
preferred
,
and
some
of
them
are
yet
in
bloom
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
loved
him
when
he
went
away
;
I
love
him
now
in
another
degree
:
he
is
more
my
own
.
  
<EOS>
The
sun
passes
the
equinox
;
the
days
shorten
,
the
leaves
grow
sere
;
but
 
he
is
coming
.
  
<EOS>
Frosts
appear
at
night
;
November
has
sent
his
fogs
in
advance
;
the
wind
takes
its
autumn
moan
;
but
 
he
is
coming
.
  
<EOS>
The
skies
hang
full
and
dark
 
a
wrack
sails
from
the
west
;
the
clouds
cast
themselves
into
strange
forms
 
arches
and
broad
radiations
;
there
rise
resplendent
mornings
 
glorious
,
royal
,
purple
as
monarch
in
his
state
;
the
heavens
are
one
flame
;
so
wild
are
they
,
they
rival
battle
at
its
thickest
 
<EOS>
so
bloody
,
they
shame
Victory
in
her
pride
.
<EOS>
I
know
some
signs
of
the
sky
;
I
have
noted
them
ever
since
childhood
.
<EOS>
God
watch
that
sail
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
guard
it
!
  
<EOS>
The
wind
shifts
to
the
west
.
<EOS>
Peace
,
peace
,
Banshee
 
"
keening
"
at
every
window
!
<EOS>
It
will
rise
 
<EOS>
it
will
swell
 
it
shrieks
out
long
:
<EOS>
wander
as
I
may
through
the
house
this
night
,
I
can
not
lull
the
blast
.
<EOS>
The
advancing
hours
make
it
strong
:
by
midnight
,
all
sleepless
watchers
hear
and
fear
a
wild
south
-
west
storm
.
<EOS>
That
storm
roared
frenzied
,
for
seven
days
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
cease
till
the
Atlantic
was
strewn
with
wrecks
:
it
did
not
lull
till
the
deeps
had
gorged
their
full
of
sustenance
.
<EOS>
Not
till
the
destroying
angel
of
tempest
had
achieved
his
perfect
work
,
would
he
fold
the
wings
whose
waft
was
thunder
 
<EOS>
the
tremor
of
whose
plumes
was
storm
.
  
<EOS>
Peace
,
be
still
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
a
thousand
weepers
,
praying
in
agony
on
waiting
shores
,
listened
for
that
voice
,
but
it
was
not
uttered
 
not
uttered
till
;
<EOS>
when
the
hush
came
,
some
could
not
feel
it
:
<EOS>
till
,
when
the
sun
returned
,
his
light
was
night
to
some
!
  
<EOS>
Here
pause
:
pause
at
once
.
<EOS>
There
is
enough
said
.
<EOS>
Trouble
no
quiet
,
kind
heart
;
leave
sunny
imaginations
hope
.
<EOS>
Let
it
be
theirs
to
conceive
the
delight
of
joy
born
again
fresh
out
of
great
terror
,
the
rapture
of
rescue
from
peril
,
the
wondrous
reprieve
from
dread
,
the
fruition
of
return
.
<EOS>
Let
them
picture
union
and
a
happy
succeeding
life
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Beck
prospered
all
the
days
of
her
life
;
so
did
Père
Silas
;
Madame
Walravens
fulfilled
her
ninetieth
year
before
she
died
.
<EOS>
Farewell
.
  
<EOS>
THE
END
