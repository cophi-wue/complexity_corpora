<EOS>
THAT
your
Dedicator
has
perused
,
with
feelings
of
virtuous
indignation
,
a
work
purporting
to
be
"

written
by

illustrated
by

and
published

<EOS>
THAT
after
an
attentive
and
vigilant
perusal
of
the
said
work
,
your
Dedicator
is
humbly
of
opinion
that
so
many
libels
,
upon
your
Honourable
sex
,
were
never
contained
in
any
previously
published
work
,
in
twelvemo
or
any
other
mo
.
  
<EOS>
THAT
in
the
title
page
and
preface
to
the
said
work
,
your
Honourable
sex
are
described
and
classified
as
animals
;
and
although
your
Dedicator
is
not
at
present
prepared
to
deny
that
you
ARE
animals
,
still
he
humbly
submits
that
it
is
not
polite
to
call
you
so
.
  
<EOS>
THAT
in
the
aforesaid
preface
,
your
Honourable
sex
are
also
described
as
Troglodites
,
which
,
being
a
hard
word
,
may
,
for
aught
your
Honourable
sex
or
your
Dedicator
can
say
to
the
contrary
,
be
an
injurious
and
disrespectful
appellation
.
  
<EOS>
THAT
the
author
of
the
said
work
applied
himself
to
his
task
in
malice
prepense
and
with
wickedness
aforethought
;
a
fact
which
,
your
Dedicator
contends
,
is
sufficiently
demonstrated
,
by
his
assuming
the
name
of
Quiz
,
which
,
your
Dedicator
submits
,
denotes
a
foregone
conclusion
,
and
implies
an
intention
of
quizzing

<EOS>
THAT
in
the
execution
of
his
evil
design
,
the
said
Quiz
,
or
author
of

must
have
betrayed
some
trust

confidence
reposed
in
him
by
some
members
of
your
Honourable

otherwise
he
never
could
have
acquired
so
much
information
relative
to
the
manners

customs
of
your
Honourable
sex
in
general
.
  
<EOS>
THAT
actuated
by
these
considerations
,

further
moved
by
various
slanders

your

of

now
solicits
your

<EOS>
THAT
as
the
Young
Ladies

the

companions
of

so
the
Young
Gentlemen

be
the
best
companions
of

and
extending
the
comparison
from
animals
(
to
quote
the
disrespectful
language
of
the
said
Quiz
)
to
inanimate
objects
,
your
Dedicator
humbly
suggests
,
that
such
of
your
Honourable
sex
as
purchased
the
bane
should
possess
themselves
of
the
antidote
,
and
that
those
of
your
Honourable
sex
who
were
not
rash
enough
to
take
the
first
,
should
lose
no
time
in
swallowing
the

being
in

better

acknowledgment

also
of
traditionary
wisdom

THAT
with
reference
to
the

antidote
,
your
Dedicator
has
no
further
remarks
to
make

comprised
in

Doctor
Morison

,
that
whenever

The
Bashful
Young
Gentleman
    
<EOS>
We
found
ourself
seated
at
a
small
dinner
party
the
other
day
,
opposite
a
stranger
of
such
singular
appearance
and
manner
,
that
he
irresistibly
attracted
our
attention
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
fresh
-
coloured
young
gentleman
,
with
as
good
a
promise
of
light
whisker
as
one
might
wish
to
see
,
and
possessed
of
a
very
velvet
-
like
,
soft
-
looking
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
not
use
the
latter
term
invidiously
,
but
merely
to
denote
a
pair
of
smooth
,
plump
,
highly
-
coloured
cheeks
of
capacious
dimensions
,
and
a
mouth
rather
remarkable
for
the
fresh
hue
of
the
lips
than
for
any
marked
or
striking
expression
it
presented
.
 
<EOS>
His
whole
face
was
suffused
with
a
crimson
blush
,
and
bore
that
downcast
,
timid
,
retiring
look
,
which
betokens
a
man
ill
at
ease
with
himself
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
in
these
symptoms
to
attract
more
than
a
passing
remark
,
but
our
attention
had
been
originally
drawn
to
the
bashful
young
gentleman
,
on
his
first
appearance
in
the
drawing
-
room
above
-
stairs
,
into
which
he
was
no
sooner
introduced
,
than
making
his
way
towards
us
who
were
standing
in
a
window
,
and
wholly
neglecting
several
persons
who
warmly
accosted
him
,
he
seized
our
hand
with
visible
emotion
,
and
pressed
it
with
a
convulsive
grasp
for
a
good
couple
of
minutes
,
after
which
he
dived
in
a
nervous
manner
across
the
room
,
oversetting
in
his
way
a
fine
little
girl
of
six
years
and
a
quarter
old
---
and
shrouding
himself
behind
some
hangings
,
was
seen
no
more
,
until
the
eagle
eye
of
the
hostess
detecting
him
in
his
concealment
,
on
the
announcement
of
dinner
,
he
was
requested
to
pair
off
with
a
lively
single
lady
,
of
two
or
three
and
thirty
.
  
<EOS>
This
most
flattering
salutation
from
a
perfect
stranger
,
would
have
gratified
us
not
a
little
as
a
token
of
his
having
held
us
in
high
respect
,
and
for
that
reason
been
desirous
of
our
acquaintance
,
if
we
had
not
suspected
from
the
first
,
that
the
young
gentleman
,
in
making
a
desperate
effort
to
get
through
the
ceremony
of
introduction
,
had
,
in
the
bewilderment
of
his
ideas
,
shaken
hands
with
us
at
random
.
 
<EOS>
This
impression
was
fully
confirmed
by
the
subsequent
behaviour
of
the
bashful
young
gentleman
in
question
,
which
we
noted
particularly
,
with
the
view
of
ascertaining
whether
we
were
right
in
our
conjecture
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
seated
himself
at
table
with
evident
misgivings
,
and
turning
sharp
round
to
pay
attention
to
some
observation
of
his
loquacious
neighbour
,
overset
his
bread
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
very
bad
in
this
,
and
if
he
had
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
let
it
go
,
and
say
nothing
about
it
,
nobody
but
the
man
who
had
laid
the
cloth
would
have
been
a
bit
the
wiser
;
but
the
young
gentleman
in
various
semi
-
successful
attempts
to
prevent
its
fall
,
played
with
it
a
little
,
as
gentlemen
in
the
streets
may
be
seen
to
do
with
their
hats
on
a
windy
day
,
and
then
giving
the
roll
a
smart
rap
in
his
anxiety
to
catch
it
,
knocked
it
with
great
adroitness
into
a
tureen
of
white
soup
at
some
distance
,
to
the
unspeakable
terror
and
disturbance
of
a
very
amiable
bald
gentleman
,
who
was
dispensing
the
contents
.
 
<EOS>
We
thought
the
bashful
young
gentleman
would
have
gone
off
in
an
apoplectic
fit
,
consequent
upon
the
violent
rush
of
blood
to
his
face
at
the
occurrence
of
this
catastrophe
.
  
<EOS>
From
this
moment
we
perceived
,
in
the
phraseology
of
the
fancy
,
that
it
was
"
all
up
"
with
the
bashful
young
gentleman
,
and
so
indeed
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Several
benevolent
persons
endeavoured
to
relieve
his
embarrassment
by
taking
wine
with
him
,
but
finding
that
it
only
augmented
his
sufferings
,
and
that
after
mingling
sherry
,
champagne
,
hock
,
and
moselle
together
,
he
applied
the
greater
part
of
the
mixture
externally
,
instead
of
internally
,
they
gradually
dropped
off
,
and
left
him
to
the
exclusive
care
of
the
talkative
lady
,
who
,
not
noting
the
wildness
of
his
eye
,
firmly
believed
she
had
secured
a
listener
.
 
<EOS>
He
broke
a
glass
or
two
in
the
course
of
the
meal
,
and
disappeared
shortly
afterwards
;
it
is
inferred
that
he
went
away
in
some
confusion
,
inasmuch
as
he
left
the
house
in
another
gentleman
's
coat
,
and
the
footman
's
hat
.
  
<EOS>
This
little
incident
led
us
to
reflect
upon
the
most
prominent
characteristics
of
bashful
young
gentlemen
in
the
abstract
;
and
as
this
portable
volume
will
be
the
great
text
-
book
of
young
ladies
in
all
future
generations
,
we
record
them
here
for
their
guidance
and
behoof
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
bashful
young
gentleman
,
in
turning
a
street
corner
,
chance
to
stumble
suddenly
upon
two
or
three
young
ladies
of
his
acquaintance
,
nothing
can
exceed
his
confusion
and
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
His
first
impulse
is
to
make
a
great
variety
of
bows
,
and
dart
past
them
,
which
he
does
until
,
observing
that
they
wish
to
stop
,
but
are
uncertain
whether
to
do
so
or
not
<EOS>
,
he
makes
several
feints
of
returning
,
which
causes
them
to
do
the
same
;
and
at
length
,
after
a
great
quantity
of
unnecessary
dodging
and
falling
up
against
the
other
passengers
,
he
returns
and
shakes
hands
most
affectionately
with
all
of
them
,
in
doing
which
he
knocks
out
of
their
grasp
sundry
little
parcels
,
which
he
hastily
picks
up
,
and
returns
very
muddy
and
disordered
.
 
<EOS>
The
chances
are
that
the
bashful
young
gentleman
then
observes
it
is
very
fine
weather
,
and
being
reminded
that
it
has
only
just
left
off
raining
for
the
first
time
these
three
days
,
he
blushes
very
much
,
and
smiles
as
if
he
had
said
a
very
good
thing
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
lady
who
was
most
anxious
to
speak
,
here
inquires
,
with
an
air
of
great
commiseration
,
how
his
dear
sister
Harriet
is
to
-
day
;
to
which
the
young
gentleman
,
without
the
slightest
consideration
,
replies
with
many
thanks
,
that
she
is
remarkably
well
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr
Hopkins
!
<EOS>
"
cries
the
young
lady
,
"
why
,
we
heard
she
was
bled
yesterday
evening
,
and
have
been
perfectly
miserable
about
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
ah
,
"
says
the
young
gentleman
,
"
<EOS>
so
she
was
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
she
's
very
ill
,
very
ill
indeed
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
then
shakes
his
head
,
and
looks
very
desponding
(
he
has
been
smiling
perpetually
up
to
this
time
)
,
and
after
a
short
pause
,
gives
his
glove
a
great
wrench
at
the
wrist
,
and
says
,
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
adjective
,
"
<EOS>
GOOD
morning
,
GOOD
morning
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
making
a
great
number
of
bows
in
acknowledgment
of
several
little
messages
to
his
sister
,
walks
backward
a
few
paces
,
and
comes
with
great
violence
against
a
lamp
-
post
,
knocking
his
hat
off
in
the
contact
,
which
in
his
mental
confusion
and
bodily
pain
he
is
going
to
walk
away
without
,
until
a
great
roar
from
a
carter
attracts
his
attention
,
when
he
picks
it
up
,
and
tries
to
smile
cheerfully
to
the
young
ladies
,
who
are
looking
back
,
and
who
,
he
has
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
,
are
all
laughing
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
At
a
quadrille
party
,
the
bashful
young
gentleman
always
remains
as
near
the
entrance
of
the
room
as
possible
,
from
which
position
he
smiles
at
the
people
he
knows
as
they
come
in
,
and
sometimes
steps
forward
to
shake
hands
with
more
intimate
friends
:
 
a
process
which
on
each
repetition
seems
to
turn
him
a
deeper
scarlet
than
before
.
<EOS>
He
declines
dancing
the
first
set
or
two
,
observing
,
in
a
faint
voice
,
that
he
would
rather
wait
a
little
;
but
at
length
is
absolutely
compelled
to
allow
himself
to
be
introduced
to
a
partner
,
when
he
is
led
,
in
a
great
heat
and
blushing
furiously
,
across
the
room
to
a
spot
where
half
-
a
-
dozen
unknown
ladies
are
congregated
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Lambert
,
let
me
introduce
Mr
Hopkins
for
the
next
quadrille
.
"
 
<EOS>
Miss
Lambert
inclines
her
head
graciously
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Hopkins
bows
,
and
his
fair
conductress
disappears
,
leaving
Mr
Hopkins
,
as
he
too
well
knows
,
to
make
himself
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
lady
more
than
half
expects
that
the
bashful
young
gentleman
will
say
something
,
and
the
bashful
young
gentleman
feeling
this
,
seriously
thinks
whether
he
has
got
anything
to
say
,
which
,
upon
mature
reflection
,
he
is
rather
disposed
to
conclude
he
has
not
,
since
nothing
occurs
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
young
lady
,
after
several
inspections
of
her
BOUQUET
,
all
made
in
the
expectation
that
the
bashful
young
gentleman
is
going
to
talk
,
whispers
her
mamma
,
who
is
sitting
next
her
,
which
whisper
the
bashful
young
gentleman
immediately
suspects
(
and
possibly
with
very
good
reason
)
must
be
about
HIM
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
comfortable
condition
he
remains
until
it
is
time
to
"
stand
up
,
"
when
murmuring
a
<EOS>
"
Will
you
allow
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
gives
the
young
lady
his
arm
,
and
after
inquiring
where
she
will
stand
,
and
receiving
a
reply
that
she
has
no
choice
,
conducts
her
to
the
remotest
corner
of
the
quadrille
,
and
making
one
attempt
at
conversation
,
which
turns
out
a
desperate
failure
,
preserves
a
profound
silence
until
it
is
all
over
,
when
he
walks
her
twice
round
the
room
,
deposits
her
in
her
old
seat
,
and
retires
in
confusion
.

A
married
bashful
gentleman
---
for
these
bashful
gentlemen
do
get
married
sometimes
;
how
it
is
ever
brought
about
,
is
a
mystery
to
us
---
a
married
bashful
gentleman
either
causes
his
wife
to
appear
bold
by
contrast
,
or
merges
her
proper
importance
in
his
own
insignificance
.
 
<EOS>
Bashful
young
gentlemen
should
be
cured
,
or
avoided
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
never
hopeless
,
and
never
will
be
,
while
female
beauty
and
attractions
retain
their
influence
,
as
any
young
lady
will
find
,
who
may
think
it
worth
while
on
this
confident
assurance
to
take
a
patient
in
hand
.

The
Out
-
And
-
Out
Young
Gentleman
    
Out
-
and
-
out
young
gentlemen
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
---
those
who
have
something
to
do
,
and
those
who
have
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
commence
with
the
former
,
because
that
species
come
more
frequently
under
the
notice
of
young
ladies
,
whom
it
is
our
province
to
warn
and
to
instruct
.
  
<EOS>
The
out
-
and
-
out
young
gentleman
is
usually
no
great
dresser
,
his
instructions
to
his
tailor
being
all
comprehended
in
the
one
general
direction
to
"
make
that
what's
-
a
-
name
a
regular
bang
-
up
sort
of
thing
.
"
 
<EOS>
For
some
years
past
,
the
favourite
costume
of
the
out
-
and
-
out
young
gentleman
has
been
a
rough
pilot
coat
,
with
two
gilt
hooks
and
eyes
to
the
velvet
collar
;
buttons
somewhat
larger
than
crown
-
pieces
;
a
black
or
fancy
neckerchief
,
loosely
tied
;
a
wide
-
brimmed
hat
,
with
a
low
crown
;
tightish
inexpressibles
,
and
iron
-
shod
boots
.
 
<EOS>
Out
of
doors
he
sometimes
carries
a
large
ash
stick
,
but
only
on
special
occasions
,
for
he
prefers
keeping
his
hands
in
his
coat
pockets
.
 
<EOS>
He
smokes
at
all
hours
,
of
course
,
and
swears
considerably
.
  
<EOS>
The
out
-
and
-
out
young
gentleman
is
employed
in
a
city
counting
-
house
or
solicitor
's
office
,
in
which
he
does
as
little
as
he
possibly
can
:
 
his
chief
places
of
resort
are
,
the
streets
,
the
taverns
,
and
the
theatres
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
streets
at
evening
time
,
out
-
and
-
out
young
gentlemen
have
a
pleasant
custom
of
walking
six
or
eight
abreast
,
thus
driving
females
and
other
inoffensive
persons
into
the
road
,
which
never
fails
to
afford
them
the
highest
satisfaction
,
especially
if
there
be
any
immediate
danger
of
their
being
run
over
,
which
enhances
the
fun
of
the
thing
materially
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
places
of
public
resort
,
the
out
-
and
-
outers
are
careful
to
select
each
a
seat
to
himself
,
upon
which
he
lies
at
full
length
,
and
(
if
the
weather
be
very
dirty
,
but
not
in
any
other
case
)
he
lies
with
his
knees
up
,
and
the
soles
of
his
boots
planted
firmly
on
the
cushion
,
so
that
if
any
low
fellow
should
ask
him
to
make
room
for
a
lady
,
he
takes
ample
revenge
upon
her
dress
,
without
going
at
all
out
of
his
way
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
sits
with
his
hat
on
,
and
flourishes
his
stick
in
the
air
while
the
play
is
proceeding
,
with
a
dignified
contempt
of
the
performance
;
if
it
be
possible
for
one
or
two
out
-
and
-
out
young
gentlemen
to
get
up
a
little
crowding
in
the
passages
,
they
are
quite
in
their
element
,
squeezing
,
pushing
,
whooping
,
and
shouting
in
the
most
humorous
manner
possible
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
can
only
succeed
in
irritating
the
gentleman
who
has
a
family
of
daughters
under
his
charge
,
they
are
like
to
die
with
laughing
,
and
boast
of
it
among
their
companions
for
a
week
afterwards
,
adding
,
that
one
or
two
of
them
were
"
devilish
fine
girls
,
"
and
that
they
really
thought
the
youngest
would
have
fainted
,
which
was
the
only
thing
wanted
to
render
the
joke
complete
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
out
-
and
-
out
young
gentleman
have
a
mother
and
sisters
,
of
course
he
treats
them
with
becoming
contempt
,
inasmuch
as
they
(
poor
things
!
)
<EOS>
having
no
notion
of
life
or
gaiety
,
are
far
too
weak
-
spirited
and
moping
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
however
,
on
a
birth
-
day
or
at
Christmas
-
time
,
he
can
not
very
well
help
accompanying
them
to
a
party
at
some
old
friend
's
,
<EOS>
with
which
view
he
comes
home
when
they
have
been
dressed
an
hour
or
two
,
smelling
very
strongly
of
tobacco
and
spirits
,
and
after
exchanging
his
rough
coat
for
some
more
suitable
attire
(
in
which
however
he
loses
nothing
of
the
out
-
and
-
outer
)
,
gets
into
the
coach
and
grumbles
all
the
way
at
his
own
good
nature
:
 
his
bitter
reflections
aggravated
by
the
recollection
,
that
Tom
Smith
has
taken
the
chair
at
a
little
impromptu
dinner
at
a
fighting
man
's
,
and
that
a
set
-
to
was
to
take
place
on
a
dining
-
table
,
between
the
fighting
man
and
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
which
is
probably
"
coming
off
"
at
that
very
instant
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
out
-
and
-
out
young
gentleman
is
by
no
means
at
his
ease
in
ladies
'
society
,
he
shrinks
into
a
corner
of
the
drawing
-
room
when
they
reach
the
friend
's
,
and
unless
one
of
his
sisters
is
kind
enough
to
talk
to
him
,
remains
there
without
being
much
troubled
by
the
attentions
of
other
people
,
until
he
espies
,
lingering
outside
the
door
,
another
gentleman
,
whom
he
at
once
knows
,
by
his
air
and
manner
<EOS>
(
for
there
is
a
kind
of
free
-
masonry
in
the
craft
)
,
to
be
a
brother
out
-
and
-
outer
,
and
towards
whom
he
accordingly
makes
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
Conversation
being
soon
opened
by
some
casual
remark
,
the
second
out
-
and
-
outer
confidentially
informs
the
first
,
that
he
is
one
of
the
rough
sort
and
hates
that
kind
of
thing
,
only
he
could
n't
very
well
be
off
coming
;
to
which
the
other
replies
,
that
that
's
just
his
case
---
"
<EOS>
and
I
'll
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
"
continues
the
out
-
and
-
outer
in
a
whisper
,
"
I
should
like
a
glass
of
warm
brandy
and
water
just
now
,
"
---
"
Or
a
pint
of
stout
and
a
pipe
,
"
suggests
the
other
out
-
and
-
outer
.
  
<EOS>
The
discovery
is
at
once
made
that
they
are
sympathetic
souls
;
each
of
them
says
at
the
same
moment
,
that
he
sees
the
other
understands
what
's
what
:
 
<EOS>
and
they
become
fast
friends
at
once
,
more
especially
when
it
appears
,
that
the
second
out
-
and
-
outer
is
no
other
than
a
gentleman
,
long
favourably
known
to
his
familiars
as
"
Mr
Warmint
Blake
,
"
who
upon
divers
occasions
has
distinguished
himself
in
a
manner
that
would
not
have
disgraced
the
fighting
man
,
and
who
---
having
been
a
pretty
long
time
about
town
---
had
the
honour
of
once
shaking
hands
with
the
celebrated
Mr
Thurtell
himself
.
  
<EOS>
At
supper
,
these
gentlemen
greatly
distinguish
themselves
,
brightening
up
very
much
when
the
ladies
leave
the
table
,
and
proclaiming
aloud
their
intention
of
beginning
to
spend
the
evening
---
a
process
which
is
generally
understood
to
be
satisfactorily
performed
,
when
a
great
deal
of
wine
is
drunk
and
a
great
deal
of
noise
made
,
both
of
which
feats
the
out
-
and
-
out
young
gentlemen
execute
to
perfection
.
 
<EOS>
Having
protracted
their
sitting
until
long
after
the
host
and
the
other
guests
have
adjourned
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
finding
that
they
have
drained
the
decanters
empty
,
they
follow
them
thither
with
complexions
rather
heightened
,
and
faces
rather
bloated
with
wine
;
and
the
agitated
lady
of
the
house
whispers
her
friends
as
they
waltz
together
,
to
the
great
terror
of
the
whole
room
,
that
"
both
Mr
Blake
and
Mr
Dummins
are
very
nice
sort
of
young
men
in
their
way
,
only
they
are
eccentric
persons
,
and
unfortunately
RATHER
TOO
WILD
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
remaining
class
of
out
-
and
-
out
young
gentlemen
is
composed
of
persons
,
who
,
having
no
money
of
their
own
and
a
soul
above
earning
any
,
enjoy
similar
pleasures
,
nobody
knows
how
.
 
<EOS>
These
respectable
gentlemen
,
without
aiming
quite
so
much
at
the
out
-
and
-
out
in
external
appearance
,
are
distinguished
by
all
the
same
amiable
and
attractive
characteristics
,
in
an
equal
or
perhaps
greater
degree
,
and
now
and
then
find
their
way
into
society
,
through
the
medium
of
the
other
class
of
out
-
and
-
out
young
gentlemen
,
who
will
sometimes
carry
them
home
,
and
who
usually
pay
their
tavern
bills
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
are
equally
gentlemanly
,
clever
,
witty
,
intelligent
,
wise
,
and
well
-
bred
,
we
need
scarcely
have
recommended
them
to
the
peculiar
consideration
of
the
young
ladies
,
if
it
were
not
that
some
of
the
gentle
creatures
whom
we
hold
in
such
high
respect
,
are
perhaps
a
little
too
apt
to
confound
a
great
many
heavier
terms
with
the
light
word
eccentricity
,
which
we
beg
them
henceforth
to
take
in
a
strictly
Johnsonian
sense
,
without
any
liberality
or
latitude
of
construction

<EOS>
The
Very
Friendly
Young
Gentleman
    
<EOS>
We
know
---
<EOS>
and
all
people
know
<EOS>
---
so
many
specimens
of
this
class
,
that
in
selecting
the
few
heads
our
limits
enable
us
to
take
from
a
great
number
,
we
have
been
induced
to
give
the
very
friendly
young
gentleman
the
preference
over
many
others
,
to
whose
claims
upon
a
more
cursory
view
of
the
question
we
had
felt
disposed
to
assign
the
priority
.
  
<EOS>
The
very
friendly
young
gentleman
is
very
friendly
to
everybody
,
but
he
attaches
himself
particularly
to
two
,
or
at
most
to
three
families
:
 
regulating
his
choice
by
their
dinners
,
their
circle
of
acquaintance
,
or
some
other
criterion
in
which
he
has
an
immediate
interest
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
of
any
age
between
twenty
and
forty
,
unmarried
of
course
,
must
be
fond
of
children
,
and
is
expected
to
make
himself
generally
useful
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
illustrate
our
meaning
by
an
example
,
which
is
the
shortest
mode
and
the
clearest
.
  
<EOS>
We
encountered
one
day
,
by
chance
,
an
old
friend
of
whom
we
had
lost
sight
for
some
years
,
and
who
---
expressing
a
strong
anxiety
to
renew
our
former
intimacy
---
urged
us
to
dine
with
him
on
an
early
day
,
that
we
might
talk
over
old
times
.
 
<EOS>
We
readily
assented
,
adding
,
that
we
hoped
we
should
be
alone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
,
certainly
,
"
said
our
friend
,
"
not
a
soul
with
us
but
Mincin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
who
is
Mincin
?
"
was
our
natural
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
"
O
do
n't
mind
him
,
"
replied
our
friend
,
"
he
's
a
most
particular
friend
of
mine
,
and
a
very
friendly
fellow
you
will
find
him
;
"
and
so
he
left
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
thought
no
more
about
Mincin
until
we
duly
presented
ourselves
at
the
house
next
day
,
when
,
after
a
hearty
welcome
,
our
friend
motioned
towards
a
gentleman
who
had
been
previously
showing
his
teeth
by
the
fireplace
,
and
gave
us
to
understand
that
it
was
Mr
Mincin
,
of
whom
he
had
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
It
required
no
great
penetration
on
our
part
to
discover
at
once
that
Mr
Mincin
was
in
every
respect
a
very
friendly
young
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
delighted
,
"
said
Mincin
,
hastily
advancing
,
and
pressing
our
hand
warmly
between
both
of
his
,
"
I
am
delighted
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
to
make
your
acquaintance
---
(
here
he
smiled
)
---
very
much
delighted
indeed
---
(
here
he
exhibited
a
little
emotion
)
---
I
assure
you
that
I
have
looked
forward
to
it
anxiously
for
a
very
long
time
:
"
here
he
released
our
hands
,
and
rubbing
his
own
,
observed
,
that
the
day
was
severe
,
but
that
he
was
delighted
to
perceive
from
our
appearance
that
it
agreed
with
us
wonderfully
;
and
then
went
on
to
observe
,
that
,
notwithstanding
the
coldness
of
the
weather
,
he
had
that
morning
seen
in
the
paper
an
exceedingly
curious
paragraph
,
to
the
effect
,
that
there
was
now
in
the
garden
of
Mr
Wilkins
of
Chichester
,
a
pumpkin
,
measuring
four
feet
in
height
,
and
eleven
feet
seven
inches
in
circumference
,
which
he
looked
upon
as
a
very
extraordinary
piece
of
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
We
ventured
to
remark
,
that
we
had
a
dim
recollection
of
having
once
or
twice
before
observed
a
similar
paragraph
in
the
public
prints
,
upon
which
Mr
Mincin
took
us
confidentially
by
the
button
,
and
said
,
<EOS>
Exactly
,
exactly
,
to
be
sure
,
we
were
very
right
,
and
he
wondered
what
the
editors
meant
by
putting
in
such
things
.
 
<EOS>
Who
the
deuce
,
he
should
like
to
know
,
did
they
suppose
cared
about
them
?
<EOS>
that
struck
him
as
being
the
best
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
lady
of
the
house
appeared
shortly
afterwards
,
and
Mr
Mincin
's
friendliness
,
as
will
readily
be
supposed
,
suffered
no
diminution
in
consequence
;
he
exerted
much
strength
and
skill
in
wheeling
a
large
easy
-
chair
up
to
the
fire
,
and
the
lady
being
seated
in
it
,
carefully
closed
the
door
,
stirred
the
fire
,
and
looked
to
the
windows
to
see
that
they
admitted
no
air
;
having
satisfied
himself
upon
all
these
points
,
he
expressed
himself
quite
easy
in
his
mind
,
and
begged
to
know
how
she
found
herself
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
the
lady
's
replying
very
well
,
Mr
Mincin
(
who
it
appeared
was
a
medical
gentleman
)
offered
some
general
remarks
upon
the
nature
and
treatment
of
colds
in
the
head
,
which
occupied
us
agreeably
until
dinner
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
meal
,
he
devoted
himself
to
complimenting
everybody
,
not
forgetting
himself
,
so
that
we
were
an
uncommonly
agreeable
quartette
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
Capper
,
"
said
Mr
Mincin
to
our
host
,
as
he
closed
the
room
door
after
the
lady
had
retired
,
"
you
have
very
great
reason
to
be
fond
of
your
wife
.
 
<EOS>
Sweet
woman
,
Mrs
Capper
,
sir
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Mincin
---
I
beg
,
"
interposed
the
host
,
as
we
were
about
to
reply
that
Mrs
Capper
unquestionably
was
particularly
sweet
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Mincin
,
do
n't
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
exclaimed
Mr
Mincin
,
"
why
not
?
<EOS>
Why
should
you
feel
any
delicacy
before
your
old
friend
---
OUR
old
friend
,
if
I
may
be
allowed
to
call
you
so
,
sir
;
why
should
you
,
I
ask
?
"
 
<EOS>
We
of
course
wished
to
know
why
he
should
also
,
upon
which
our
friend
admitted
that
Mrs
Capper
WAS
a
very
sweet
woman
,
at
which
admission
Mr
Mincin
cried
"
Bravo
!
"
and
begged
to
propose
Mrs
Capper
with
heartfelt
enthusiasm
,
whereupon
our
host
said
,
"
Thank
you
,
Mincin
,
"
with
deep
feeling
;
and
gave
us
,
in
a
low
voice
,
to
understand
,
that
Mincin
had
saved
Mrs
Capper
's
cousin
's
life
no
less
than
fourteen
times
in
a
year
and
a
half
,
which
he
considered
no
common
circumstance
---
an
opinion
to
which
we
most
cordially
subscribed
.
  
<EOS>
Now
that
we
three
were
left
to
entertain
ourselves
with
conversation
,
Mr
Mincin
's
extreme
friendliness
became
every
moment
more
apparent
;
he
was
so
amazingly
friendly
,
indeed
,
that
it
was
impossible
to
talk
about
anything
in
which
he
had
not
the
chief
concern
.
 
<EOS>
We
happened
to
allude
to
some
affairs
in
which
our
friend
and
we
had
been
mutually
engaged
nearly
fourteen
years
before
,
when
Mr
Mincin
was
all
at
once
reminded
of
a
joke
which
our
friend
had
made
on
that
day
four
years
,
which
he
positively
must
insist
upon
telling
---
and
which
he
did
tell
accordingly
,
with
many
pleasant
recollections
of
what
he
said
,
and
what
Mrs
Capper
said
,
and
how
he
well
remembered
that
they
had
been
to
the
play
with
orders
on
the
very
night
previous
,
and
had
seen
Romeo
and
Juliet
,
and
the
pantomime
,
and
how
Mrs
Capper
being
faint
had
been
led
into
the
lobby
,
where
she
smiled
,
said
it
was
nothing
after
all
,
and
went
back
again
,
with
many
other
interesting
and
absorbing
particulars
:
after
which
the
friendly
young
gentleman
went
on
to
assure
us
,
that
our
friend
had
experienced
a
marvellously
prophetic
opinion
of
that
same
pantomime
,
which
was
of
such
an
admirable
kind
,
that
two
morning
papers
took
the
same
view
next
day
:
 
to
this
our
friend
replied
,
with
a
little
triumph
,
that
in
that
instance
he
had
some
reason
to
think
he
had
been
correct
,
which
gave
the
friendly
young
gentleman
occasion
to
believe
that
our
friend
was
always
correct
;
and
so
we
went
on
,
until
our
friend
,
filling
a
bumper
,
<EOS>
said
he
must
drink
one
glass
to
his
dear
friend
Mincin
,
than
whom
he
would
say
no
man
saved
the
lives
of
his
acquaintances
more
,
or
had
a
more
friendly
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
our
friend
having
emptied
his
glass
,
said
,
"
God
bless
you
,
Mincin
,
"
---
and
Mr
Mincin
<EOS>
and
he
shook
hands
across
the
table
with
much
affection
and
earnestness
.
  
<EOS>
But
great
as
the
friendly
young
gentleman
is
,
in
a
limited
scene
like
this
,
he
plays
the
same
part
on
a
larger
scale
with
increased
ECLAT
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mincin
is
invited
to
an
evening
party
with
his
dear
friends
the
Martins
,
where
he
meets
his
dear
friends
the
Cappers
,
and
his
dear
friends
the
Watsons
,
and
a
hundred
other
dear
friends
too
numerous
to
mention
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
as
much
at
home
with
the
Martins
as
with
the
Cappers
;
but
how
exquisitely
he
balances
his
attentions
,
and
divides
them
among
his
dear
friends
!
 
<EOS>
If
he
flirts
with
one
of
the
Miss
Watsons
,
he
has
one
little
Martin
on
the
sofa
pulling
his
hair
,
and
the
other
little
Martin
on
the
carpet
riding
on
his
foot
.
<EOS>
He
carries
Mrs
Watson
down
to
supper
on
one
arm
,
and
Miss
Martin
on
the
other
,
and
takes
wine
so
judiciously
,
and
in
such
exact
order
,
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
most
punctilious
old
lady
to
consider
herself
neglected
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
young
lady
,
being
prevailed
upon
to
sing
,
become
nervous
afterwards
,
Mr
Mincin
leads
her
tenderly
into
the
next
room
,
and
restores
her
with
port
wine
,
which
she
must
take
medicinally
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
gentleman
be
standing
by
the
piano
during
the
progress
of
the
ballad
,
Mr
Mincin
seizes
him
by
the
arm
at
one
point
of
the
melody
,
and
softly
beating
time
the
while
with
his
head
,
expresses
in
<EOS>
dumb
show
his
intense
perception
of
the
delicacy
of
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
If
anybody
's
self
-
love
is
to
be
flattered
,
Mr
Mincin
is
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
If
anybody
's
overweening
vanity
is
to
be
pampered
,
Mr
Mincin
will
surfeit
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
wonder
that
people
of
all
stations
and
ages
recognise
Mr
Mincin
's
friendliness
<EOS>
;
that
he
is
universally
allowed
to
be
handsome
as
amiable
;
that
mothers
think
him
an
oracle
,
daughters
a
dear
,
brothers
a
beau
,
and
fathers
a
wonder
!
 
<EOS>
And
who
would
not
have
the
reputation
of
the
very
friendly
young
gentleman
?
    
<EOS>
The
Military
Young
Gentleman
    
<EOS>
We
are
rather
at
a
loss
to
imagine
how
it
has
come
to
pass
that
military
young
gentlemen
have
obtained
so
much
favour
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
ladies
of
this
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
not
think
so
lightly
of
them
as
to
suppose
that
the
mere
circumstance
of
a
man
's
wearing
a
red
coat
ensures
him
a
ready
passport
to
their
regard
;
and
even
if
this
were
the
case
,
it
would
be
no
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
circumstance
,
because
,
although
the
analogy
may
in
some
degree
hold
good
in
the
case
of
mail
coachmen
and
guards
,
still
general
postmen
wear
red
coats
,
and
THEY
are
not
to
our
knowledge
better
received
than
other
men
;
nor
are
firemen
either
,
who
wear
(
or
used
to
wear
)
not
only
red
coats
,
but
very
resplendent
and
massive
badges
besides
---
much
larger
than
epaulettes
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
do
the
twopenny
post
-
office
boys
,
if
the
result
of
our
inquiries
be
correct
,
find
any
peculiar
favour
in
woman
's
eyes
,
although
they
wear
very
bright
red
jackets
,
and
have
the
additional
advantage
of
constantly
appearing
in
public
on
horseback
,
which
last
circumstance
may
be
naturally
supposed
to
be
greatly
in
their
favour
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
sometimes
thought
that
this
phenomenon
may
take
its
rise
in
the
conventional
behaviour
of
captains
and
colonels
and
other
gentlemen
in
red
coats
on
the
stage
,
where
they
are
invariably
represented
as
fine
swaggering
fellows
,
talking
of
nothing
but
charming
girls
,
their
king
and
country
,
their
honour
,
and
their
debts
,
and
crowing
over
the
inferior
classes
of
the
community
,
whom
they
occasionally
treat
with
a
little
gentlemanly
swindling
,
no
less
to
the
improvement
and
pleasure
of
the
audience
,
than
to
the
satisfaction
and
approval
of
the
choice
spirits
who
consort
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
will
not
devote
these
pages
to
our
speculations
upon
the
subject
,
inasmuch
as
our
business
at
the
present
moment
is
not
so
much
with
the
young
ladies
who
are
bewitched
by
her
Majesty
's
livery
as
with
the
young
gentlemen
whose
heads
are
turned
by
it
.
<EOS>
For
"
heads
"
we
had
written
"
brains
;
"
but
upon
consideration
,
we
think
the
former
the
more
appropriate
word
of
the
two
.
  
<EOS>
These
young
gentlemen
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
---
young
gentlemen
who
are
actually
in
the
army
,
and
young
gentlemen
who
,
having
an
intense
and
enthusiastic
admiration
for
all
things
appertaining
to
a
military
life
,
are
compelled
by
adverse
fortune
or
adverse
relations
to
wear
out
their
existence
in
some
ignoble
counting
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
take
this
latter
description
of
military
young
gentlemen
first
.
  
<EOS>
The
whole
heart
and
soul
of
the
military
young
gentleman
are
concentrated
in
his
favourite
topic
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
that
he
is
so
learned
upon
as
uniforms
;
he
will
tell
you
,
without
faltering
for
an
instant
,
what
the
habiliments
of
any
one
regiment
are
turned
up
with
,
what
regiment
wear
stripes
down
the
outside
and
inside
of
the
leg
,
and
how
many
buttons
the
Tenth
had
on
their
coats
;
he
knows
to
a
fraction
how
many
yards
and
odd
inches
of
gold
lace
it
takes
to
make
an
ensign
in
the
Guards
;
is
deeply
read
in
the
comparative
merits
of
different
bands
,
and
the
apparelling
of
trumpeters
;
and
is
very
luminous
indeed
in
descanting
upon
"
crack
regiments
,
"
and
the
"
crack
"
gentlemen
who
compose
them
,
of
whose
mightiness
and
grandeur
he
is
never
tired
of
telling
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
suggesting
to
a
military
young
gentleman
only
the
other
day
,
after
he
had
related
to
us
several
dazzling
instances
of
the
profusion
of
half
-
a
-
dozen
honourable
ensign
somebodies
or
nobodies
in
the
articles
of
kid
gloves
and
polished
boots
,
that
possibly
"
cracked
"
regiments
would
be
an
improvement
upon
"
crack
,
"
as
being
a
more
expressive
and
appropriate
designation
,
when
he
suddenly
interrupted
us
by
pulling
out
his
watch
,
and
observing
that
he
must
hurry
off
to
the
Park
in
a
cab
,
or
he
would
be
too
late
to
hear
the
band
play
.
 
<EOS>
Not
wishing
to
interfere
with
so
important
an
engagement
,
and
being
in
fact
already
slightly
overwhelmed
by
the
anecdotes
of
the
honourable
ensigns
afore
-
mentioned
,
we
made
no
attempt
to
detain
the
military
young
gentleman
,
but
parted
company
with
ready
good
-
will
.
  
<EOS>
Some
three
or
four
hours
afterwards
,
we
chanced
to
be
walking
down
Whitehall
,
on
the
Admiralty
side
of
the
way
,
when
,
as
we
drew
near
to
one
of
the
little
stone
places
in
which
a
couple
of
horse
soldiers
mount
guard
in
the
daytime
,
we
were
attracted
by
the
motionless
appearance
and
eager
gaze
of
a
young
gentleman
,
who
was
devouring
both
man
and
horse
with
his
eyes
,
so
eagerly
,
that
he
seemed
deaf
and
blind
to
all
that
was
passing
around
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
not
much
surprised
at
the
discovery
that
it
was
our
friend
,
the
military
young
gentleman
,
but
we
WERE
a
little
astonished
when
we
returned
from
a
walk
to
South
Lambeth
to
find
him
still
there
,
looking
on
with
the
same
intensity
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
a
very
windy
day
,
we
felt
bound
to
awaken
the
young
gentleman
from
his
reverie
,
when
he
inquired
of
us
with
great
enthusiasm
,
whether
"
that
was
not
a
glorious
spectacle
,
"
and
proceeded
to
give
us
a
detailed
account
of
the
weight
of
every
article
of
the
spectacle
's
trappings
,
from
the
man
's
gloves
to
the
horse
's
shoes
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
made
it
a
practice
since
,
to
take
the
Horse
Guards
in
our
daily
walk
,
and
we
find
it
is
the
custom
of
military
young
gentlemen
to
plant
themselves
opposite
the
sentries
,
and
contemplate
them
at
leisure
,
in
periods
varying
from
fifteen
minutes
to
fifty
,
and
averaging
twenty
-
five
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
much
struck
a
day
or
two
since
,
by
the
behaviour
of
a
very
promising
young
butcher
who
(
evincing
an
interest
in
the
service
,
which
can
not
be
too
strongly
commanded
or
encouraged
)
,
after
a
prolonged
inspection
of
the
sentry
,
proceeded
to
handle
his
boots
with
great
curiosity
,
and
as
much
composure
and
indifference
as
if
the
man
were
wax
-
work
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
really
military
young
gentleman
is
waiting
all
this
time
,
and
at
the
very
moment
that
an
apology
rises
to
our
lips
,
he
emerges
from
the
barrack
gate
(
he
is
quartered
in
a
garrison
town
)
,
and
takes
the
way
towards
the
high
street
.
 
<EOS>
He
wears
his
undress
uniform
,
which
somewhat
mars
the
glory
of
his
outward
man
;
but
still
how
great
,
how
grand
,
he
is
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
happy
mixture
of
ease
and
ferocity
in
his
gait
and
carriage
,
and
how
lightly
he
carries
that
dreadful
sword
under
his
arm
,
making
no
more
ado
about
it
than
if
it
were
a
silk
umbrella
!
 
<EOS>
The
lion
is
sleeping
:
 
<EOS>
only
think
if
an
enemy
were
in
sight
,
how
soon
he
'd
whip
it
out
of
the
scabbard
,
and
what
a
terrible
fellow
he
would
be
!
  
<EOS>
But
he
walks
on
,
thinking
of
nothing
less
than
blood
and
slaughter
;
and
now
he
comes
in
sight
of
three
other
military
young
gentlemen
,
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
who
are
bearing
down
towards
him
,
clanking
their
iron
heels
on
the
pavement
,
and
clashing
their
swords
with
a
noise
,
which
should
cause
all
peaceful
men
to
quail
at
heart
.
 
<EOS>
They
stop
to
talk
.
 
<EOS>
See
how
the
flaxen
-
haired
young
gentleman
with
the
weak
legs
---
he
who
has
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
thrust
into
the
breast
of
his
coat
-
glares
upon
the
fainthearted
civilians
who
linger
to
look
upon
his
glory
;
how
the
next
young
gentleman
elevates
his
head
in
the
air
,
and
majestically
places
his
arms
a
-
kimbo
,
while
the
third
stands
with
his
legs
very
wide
apart
,
and
clasps
his
hands
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
Well
may
we
inquire
---
not
in
familiar
jest
,
but
in
respectful
earnest
---
if
you
call
that
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
some
encroaching
foreign
power
---
the
Emperor
of
Russia
,
for
instance
,
or
any
of
those
deep
fellows
,
could
only
see
those
military
young
gentlemen
as
they
move
on
together
towards
the
billiard
-
room
over
the
way
,
would
n't
he
tremble
a
little
!
  
<EOS>
And
then
,
at
the
Theatre
at
night
,
when
the
performances
are
by
command
of
Colonel
Fitz
-
Sordust
and
the
officers
of
the
garrison
---
what
a
splendid
sight
it
is
!
 
<EOS>
How
sternly
the
defenders
of
their
country
look
round
the
house
as
if
in
mute
assurance
to
the
audience
,
that
they
may
make
themselves
comfortable
regarding
any
foreign
invasion
,
for
they
(
the
military
young
gentlemen
)
are
keeping
a
sharp
look
-
out
,
and
are
ready
for
anything
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
a
contrast
between
them
,
and
that
stage
-
box
full
of
grey
-
headed
officers
with
tokens
of
many
battles
about
them
,
who
have
nothing
at
all
in
common
with
the
military
young
gentlemen
,
and
who
---
but
for
an
old
-
fashioned
kind
of
manly
dignity
in
their
looks
and
bearing
---
might
be
common
hard
-
working
soldiers
for
anything
they
take
the
pains
to
announce
to
the
contrary
!
  
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
here
is
a
family
just
come
in
who
recognise
the
flaxen
-
headed
young
gentleman
;
and
the
flaxen
-
headed
young
gentleman
recognises
them
too
,
only
he
does
n't
care
to
show
it
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
Very
well
done
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
He
talks
louder
to
the
little
group
of
military
young
gentlemen
who
are
standing
by
him
,
and
coughs
to
induce
some
ladies
in
the
next
box
but
one
to
look
round
,
in
order
that
their
faces
may
undergo
the
same
ordeal
of
criticism
to
which
they
have
subjected
,
in
not
a
wholly
inaudible
tone
,
the
majority
of
the
female
portion
of
the
audience
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
a
gentleman
in
the
same
box
looks
round
as
if
he
were
disposed
to
resent
this
as
an
impertinence
;
and
the
flaxen
-
headed
young
gentleman
sees
his
friends
at
once
,
and
hurries
away
to
them
with
the

Three
young
ladies
,
one
young
man
,
and
the
mamma
of
the
party
,
receive
the
military
young
gentleman
with
great
warmth
and
politeness
,
and
in
five
minutes
afterwards
the
military
young
gentleman
,
stimulated
by
the
mamma
,
introduces
the
two
other
military
young
gentlemen
with
whom
he
was
walking
in
the
morning
,
who
take
their
seats
behind
the
young
ladies
and
commence
conversation
;
whereat
the
mamma
bestows
a
triumphant
bow
upon
a
rival
mamma
,
who
has
not
succeeded
in
decoying
any
military
young
gentlemen
,
and
prepares
to
consider
her
visitors
from
that
moment
three
of
the
most
elegant
and
superior
young
gentlemen
in
the
whole
world
.

The
Political
Young
Gentleman
    
Once
upon
a
time
---
NOT
in
the
days
when
pigs
drank
wine
,
but
in
a
more
recent
period
of
our
history
---
it
was
customary
to
banish
politics
when
ladies
were
present
.
 
<EOS>
If
this
usage
still
prevailed
,
we
should
have
had
no
chapter
for
political
young
gentlemen
,
for
ladies
would
have
neither
known
nor
cared
what
kind
of
monster
<EOS>
a
political
young
gentleman
was
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
this
good
custom
in
common
with
many
others
has
"
gone
out
,
"
and
left
no
word
when
it
is
likely
to
be
home
again
;
as
political
young
ladies
are
by
no
means
rare
,
and
political
young
gentlemen
the
very
reverse
of
scarce
,
we
are
bound
in
the
strict
discharge
of
our
most
responsible
duty
not
to
neglect
this
natural
division
of
our
subject
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
political
young
gentleman
be
resident
in
a
country
town
(
and
there
ARE
political
young
gentlemen
in
country
towns
sometimes
)
,
he
is
wholly
absorbed
in
his
politics
;
as
a
pair
of
purple
spectacles
communicate
the
same
uniform
tint
to
all
objects
near
and
remote
,
so
the
political
glasses
,
with
which
the
young
gentleman
assists
his
mental
vision
,
give
to
everything
the
hue
and
tinge
of
party
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
The
political
young
gentleman
would
as
soon
think
of
being
struck
with
the
beauty
of
a
young
lady
in
the
opposite
interest
,
as
he
would
dream
of
marrying
his
sister
to
the
opposite
member
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
political
young
gentleman
be
a
Conservative
,
he
has
usually
some
vague
ideas
about
Ireland
and
the
Pope
which
he
can
not
very
clearly
explain
,
but
which
he
knows
are
the
right
sort
of
thing
,
and
not
to
be
very
easily
got
over
by
the
other
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
also
some
choice
sentences
regarding
church
and
state
,
culled
from
the
banners
in
use
at
the
last
election
,
with
which
he
intersperses
his
conversation
at
intervals
with
surprising
effect
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
great
topic
is
the
constitution
,
upon
which
he
will
declaim
,
by
the
hour
together
,
with
much
heat
and
fury
;
<EOS>
not
that
he
has
any
particular
information
on
the
subject
,
but
because
he
knows
that
the
constitution
is
somehow
church
and
state
,
and
church
and
state
somehow
the
constitution
,
and
that
the
fellows
on
the
other
side
say
it
is
n't
,
which
is
quite
a
sufficient
reason
for
him
to
say
it
is
,
and
to
stick
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
his
greatest
topic
of
all
,
though
,
is
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
fight
takes
place
in
a
populous
town
,
in
which
many
noses
are
broken
,
and
a
few
windows
,
the
young
gentleman
throws
down
the
newspaper
with
a
triumphant
air
,
and
exclaims
,
"
<EOS>
Here
's
your
precious
people
!
"
 
<EOS>
If
half
-
a
-
dozen
boys
run
across
the
course
at
race
time
,
when
it
ought
to
be
kept
clear
,
the
young
gentleman
looks
indignantly
round
,
and
begs
you
to
observe
the
conduct
of
the
people
;
if
the
gallery
demand
a
hornpipe
between
the
play
and
the
afterpiece
,
the
same
young
gentleman
cries
"
<EOS>
No
"
and
"
Shame
"
till
he
is
hoarse
,
and
then
inquires
with
a
sneer
what
you
think
of
popular
moderation
NOW
<EOS>
;
in
short
,
the
people
form
a
never
-
failing
theme
for
him
;
and
when
the
attorney
,
on
the
side
of
his
candidate
,
dwells
upon
it
with
great
power
of
eloquence
at
election
time
,
as
he
never
fails
to
do
,
the
young
gentleman
and
his
friends
,
and
the
body
they
head
,
cheer
with
great
violence
against
THE
OTHER
PEOPLE
,
with
whom
,
of
course
,
they
have
no
possible
connexion
.
 
<EOS>
In
much
the
same
manner
the
audience
at
a
theatre
never
fail
to
be
highly
amused
with
any
jokes
at
the
expense
of
the
public
---
always
laughing
heartily
at
some
other
public
,
and
never
at
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
political
young
gentleman
be
a
Radical
,
he
is
usually
a
very
profound
person
indeed
,
having
great
store
of
theoretical
questions
to
put
to
you
,
with
an
infinite
variety
of
possible
cases
and
logical
deductions
therefrom
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
be
of
the
utilitarian
school
,
too
,
which
is
more
than
probable
,
he
is
particularly
pleasant
company
,
having
many
ingenious
remarks
to
offer
upon
the
voluntary
principle
and
various
cheerful
disquisitions
connected
with
the
population
of
the
country
,
the
position
of
Great
Britain
in
the
scale
of
nations
,
and
the
balance
of
power
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
is
exceedingly
well
versed
in
all
doctrines
of
political
economy
as
laid
down
in
the
newspapers
,
and
knows
a
great
many
parliamentary
speeches
by
heart
;
nay
,
he
has
a
small
stock
of
aphorisms
,
none
of
them
exceeding
a
couple
of
lines
in
length
,
which
will
settle
the
toughest
question
and
leave
you
nothing
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
He
gives
all
the
young
ladies
to
understand
,
that
Miss
Martineau
is
the
greatest
woman
that
ever
lived
;
and
when
they
praise
the
good
looks
of
Mr
Hawkins
the
new
member
,
says
he
's
very
well
for
a
representative
,
all
things
considered
,
but
he
wants
a
little
calling
to
account
,
and
he
is
more
than
half
afraid
it
will
be
necessary
to
bring
him
down
on
his
knees
for
that
vote
on
the
miscellaneous
estimates
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
,
the
young
ladies
express
much
wonderment
,
and
say
surely
a
Member
of
Parliament
is
not
to
be
brought
upon
his
knees
so
easily
;
in
reply
to
which
the
political
young
gentleman
smiles
sternly
,
and
throws
out
dark
hints
regarding
the
speedy
arrival
of
that
day
,
when
Members
of
Parliament
will
be
paid
salaries
,
and
required
to
render
weekly
accounts
of
their
proceedings
,
at
which
the
young
ladies
utter
many
expressions
of
astonishment
and
incredulity
,
while
their
lady
-
mothers
regard
the
prophecy
as
little
else
than
blasphemous
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
extremely
improving
and
interesting
to
hear
two
political
young
gentlemen
,
of
diverse
opinions
,
discuss
some
great
question
across
a
dinner
-
table
;
such
as
,
whether
,
if
the
public
were
admitted
to
Westminster
Abbey
for
nothing
,
they
would
or
would
not
convey
small
chisels
and
hammers
in
their
pockets
,
and
immediately
set
about
chipping
all
the
noses
off
the
statues
;
or
whether
,
if
they
once
got
into
the
Tower
for
a
shilling
,
they
would
not
insist
upon
trying
the
crown
on
their
own
heads
,
and
loading
and
firing
off
all
the
small
arms
in
the
armoury
,
to
the
great
discomposure
of
Whitechapel
and
the
Minories
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
these
,
and
many
other
momentous
questions
which
agitate
the
public
mind
in
these
desperate
days
,
they
will
discourse
with
great
vehemence
and
irritation
for
a
considerable
time
together
,
both
leaving
off
precisely
where
they
began
,
and
each
thoroughly
persuaded
that
he
has
got
the
better
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
In
society
,
at
assemblies
,
balls
,
and
playhouses
,
these
political
young
gentlemen
are
perpetually
on
the
watch
for
a
political
allusion
,
or
anything
which
can
be
tortured
or
construed
into
being
one
;
when
,
thrusting
themselves
into
the
very
smallest
openings
for
their
favourite
discourse
,
they
fall
upon
the
unhappy
company
tooth
and
nail
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
recently
had
many
favourable
opportunities
of
opening
in
churches
,
but
as
there
the
clergyman
has
it
all
his
own
way
,
and
must
not
be
contradicted
,
whatever
politics
he
preaches
,
they
are
fain
to
hold
their
tongues
until
they
reach
the
outer
door
,
though
at
the
imminent
risk
of
bursting
in
the
effort
.
  
<EOS>
As
such
discussions
can
please
nobody
but
the
talkative
parties
concerned
,
we
hope
they
will
henceforth
take
the
hint
and
discontinue
them
,
otherwise
we
now
give
them
warning
,
that
the
ladies
have
our
advice
to
discountenance
such
talkers
altogether
.
    
<EOS>
The
Domestic
Young
Gentleman
    
Let
us
make
a
slight
sketch
of
our
amiable
friend
,
Mr
Felix
Nixon
.
<EOS>
We
are
strongly
disposed
to
think
,
that
if
we
put
him
in
this
place
,
he
will
answer
our
purpose
without
another
word
of
comment
.
  
<EOS>
Felix
,
then
,
is
a
young
gentleman
who
lives
at
home
with
his
mother
,
just
within
the
twopenny
-
post
office
circle
of
three
miles
from
St.
Martin
-
le
-
Grand
.
 
<EOS>
He
wears
Indiarubber
goloshes
when
the
weather
is
at
all
damp
,
and
always
has
a
silk
handkerchief
neatly
folded
up
in
the
right
-
hand
pocket
of
his
great
-
coat
,
to
tie
over
his
mouth
when
he
goes
home
at
night
;
moreover
,
being
rather
near
-
sighted
,
he
carries
spectacles
for
particular
occasions
,
and
has
a
weakish
tremulous
voice
,
of
which
he
makes
great
use
,
for
he
talks
as
much
as
any
old
lady
breathing
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
chief
subjects
of
Felix
's
discourse
,
are
himself
and
his
mother
,
both
of
whom
would
appear
to
be
very
wonderful
and
interesting
persons
.
 
<EOS>
As
Felix
and
his
mother
are
seldom
apart
in
body
,
so
Felix
and
his
mother
are
scarcely
ever
separate
in
spirit
.
<EOS>
If
you
ask
Felix
how
he
finds
himself
to
-
day
,
he
prefaces
his
reply
with
a
long
and
minute
bulletin
of
his
mother
's
state
of
health
;
and
the
good
lady
in
her
turn
,
edifies
her
acquaintance
with
a
circumstantial
and
alarming
account
,
how
he
sneezed
four
times
and
coughed
once
after
being
out
in
the
rain
the
other
night
,
but
having
his
feet
promptly
put
into
hot
water
,
and
his
head
into
a
flannel
-
something
,
which
we
will
not
describe
more
particularly
than
by
this
delicate
allusion
,
was
happily
brought
round
by
the
next
morning
,
and
enabled
to
go
to
business
as
usual
.
  
<EOS>
Our
friend
is
not
a
very
adventurous
or
hot
-
headed
person
,
but
he
has
passed
through
many
dangers
,
as
his
mother
can
testify
:
 
there
is
one
great
story
in
particular
,
concerning
a
hackney
coachman
who
wanted
to
overcharge
him
one
night
for
bringing
them
home
from
the
play
,
upon
which
Felix
gave
the
aforesaid
coachman
a
look
which
his
mother
thought
would
have
crushed
him
to
the
earth
,
but
which
did
not
crush
him
quite
,
for
he
continued
to
demand
another
sixpence
,
notwithstanding
that
Felix
took
out
his
pocket
-
book
,
and
,
with
the
aid
of
a
flat
candle
,
pointed
out
the
fare
in
print
,
which
the
coachman
obstinately
disregarding
,
he
shut
the
street
-
door
with
a
slam
which
his
mother
shudders
to
think
of
;
and
then
,
roused
to
the
most
appalling
pitch
of
passion
by
the
coachman
knocking
a
double
knock
to
show
that
he
was
by
no
means
convinced
,
he
broke
with
uncontrollable
force
from
his
parent
and
the
servant
girl
,
and
running
into
the
street
without
his
hat
,
actually
shook
his
fist
at
the
coachman
,
and
came
back
again
with
a
face
as
white
,
Mrs
Nixon
says
,
looking
about
her
for
a
simile
,
as
white
as
that
ceiling
.
<EOS>
She
never
will
forget
his
fury
that
night
,
Never
!
  
<EOS>
To
this
account
Felix
listens
with
a
solemn
face
,
occasionally
looking
at
you
to
see
how
it
affects
you
,
and
when
his
mother
has
made
an
end
of
it
,
adds
that
he
looked
at
every
coachman
he
met
for
three
weeks
afterwards
,
in
hopes
that
he
might
see
the
scoundrel
;
whereupon
Mrs
Nixon
,
with
an
exclamation
of
terror
,
requests
to
know
what
he
would
have
done
to
him
if
he
HAD
seen
him
,
at
which
Felix
smiling
darkly
and
clenching
his
right
fist
,
she
exclaims
,
"
Goodness
gracious
!
"
<EOS>
with
a
distracted
air
,
and
insists
upon
extorting
a
promise
that
he
never
will
on
any
account
do
anything
so
rash
,
which
her
dutiful
son
---
it
being
something
more
than
three
years
since
the
offence
was
committed
---
reluctantly
concedes
,
and
his
mother
,
shaking
her
head
prophetically
,
fears
with
a
sigh
that
his
spirit
will
lead
him
into
something
violent
yet
.
 
<EOS>
The
discourse
then
,
by
an
easy
transition
,
turns
upon
the
spirit
which
glows
within
the
bosom
of
Felix
,
upon
which
point
Felix
himself
becomes
eloquent
,
and
relates
a
thrilling
anecdote
of
the
time
when
he
used
to
sit
up
till
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
reading
French
,
and
how
his
mother
used
to
say
,
"
Felix
,
you
will
make
yourself
ill
<EOS>
,
I
know
you
will
;
"
and
how
HE
used
to
say
,
"
Mother
,
I
do
n't
care
---
I
will
do
it
;
"
and
how
at
last
his
mother
privately
procured
a
doctor
to
come
and
see
him
,
who
declared
,
<EOS>
the
moment
he
felt
his
pulse
,
that
if
he
had
gone
on
reading
one
night
more
---
only
one
night
more
---
he
must
have
put
a
blister
on
each
temple
,
and
another
between
his
shoulders
;
and
who
,
as
it
was
,
sat
down
upon
the
instant
,
and
writing
a
prescription
for
a
blue
pill
,
said
it
must
be
taken
immediately
,
or
he
would
n't
answer
for
the
consequences
.
 
<EOS>
The
recital
of
these
and
many
other
moving
perils
of
the
like
nature
,
constantly
harrows
up
the
feelings
of
Mr
Nixon
's
friends
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Nixon
has
a
tolerably
extensive
circle
of
female
acquaintance
,
being
a
good
-
humoured
,
talkative
,
bustling
little
body
,
and
to
the
unmarried
girls
among
them
<EOS>
she
is
constantly
vaunting
the
virtues
of
her
son
,
hinting
that
she
will
be
a
very
happy
person
who
wins
him
,
but
that
they
must
mind
their
P
's
and
Q
's
,
for
he
is
very
particular
,
and
terribly
severe
upon
young
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
last
caution
the
young
ladies
resident
in
the
same
row
,
who
happen
to
be
spending
the
evening
there
,
put
their
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
before
their
mouths
,
and
are
troubled
with
a
short
cough
;
just
then
Felix
knocks
at
the
door
,
and
his
mother
drawing
the
tea
-
table
nearer
the
fire
,
calls
out
to
him
as
he
takes
off
his
boots
in
the
back
parlour
that
he
need
n't
mind
coming
in
in
his
slippers
,
for
there
are
only
the
two
Miss
Greys
and
Miss
Thompson
,
and
she
is
quite
sure
they
will
excuse
HIM
,
and
nodding
to
the
two
Miss
Greys
,
she
adds
,
in
a
whisper
,
that
Julia
Thompson
is
a
great
favourite
with
Felix
,
at
which
intelligence
the
short
cough
comes
again
,
and
Miss
Thompson
in
particular
is
greatly
troubled
with
it
,
till
Felix
coming
in
,
very
faint
for
want
of
his
tea
,
changes
the
subject
of
discourse
,
and
enables
her
to
laugh
out
boldly
and
tell
Amelia
Grey
not
to
be
so
foolish
.
 
<EOS>
Here
they
all
three
laugh
,
and
Mrs
Nixon
says
they
are
giddy
girls
;
in
which
stage
of
the
proceedings
,
Felix
,
who
has
by
this
time
refreshened
himself
with
the
grateful
herb
that
"
cheers
but
not
inebriates
,
"
removes
his
cup
from
his
countenance
and
says
with
a
knowing
smile
,
that
all
girls
are
;
whereat
his
admiring
mamma
pats
him
on
the
back
and
tells
him
not
to
be
sly
,
which
calls
forth
a
general
laugh
from
the
young
ladies
,
and
another
smile
from
Felix
,
who
,
thinking
he
looks
very
sly
indeed
,
is
perfectly
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
Tea
being
over
,
the
young
ladies
resume
their
work
,
and
Felix
insists
upon
holding
a
skein
of
silk
while
Miss
Thompson
winds
it
on
a
card
.
 
<EOS>
This
process
having
been
performed
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
,
he
brings
down
his
flute
in
compliance
with
a
request
from
the
youngest
Miss
Grey
,
and
plays
divers
tunes
out
of
a
very
small
music
-
book
till
supper
-
time
,
when
he
is
very
facetious
and
talkative
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
after
half
a
tumblerful
of
warm
sherry
and
water
,
he
gallantly
puts
on
his
goloshes
over
his
slippers
,
and
telling
Miss
Thompson
's
servant
to
run
on
first
and
get
the
door
open
,
escorts
that
young
lady
to
her
house
,
five
doors
off
:
 
the
Miss
Greys
who
live
in
the
next
house
but
one
stopping
to
peep
with
merry
faces
from
their
own
door
till
he
comes
back
again
,
when
they
call
out
"
Very
well
,
Mr
Felix
,
"
and
trip
into
the
passage
with
a
laugh
more
musical
than
any
flute
that
was
ever
played
.
  
<EOS>
Felix
is
rather
prim
in
his
appearance
,
and
perhaps
a
little
priggish
about
his
books
and
flute
,
and
so
forth
,
which
have
all
their
peculiar
corners
of
peculiar
shelves
in
his
bedroom
;
indeed
all
his
female
acquaintance
(
and
they
are
good
judges
)
have
long
ago
set
him
down
as
a
thorough
old
bachelor
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
favourite
with
them
however
,
in
a
certain
way
,
as
an
honest
,
inoffensive
,
kind
-
hearted
creature
;
and
as
his
peculiarities
harm
nobody
,
not
even
himself
,
we
are
induced
to
hope
that
many
who
are
not
personally
acquainted
with
him
will
take
our
good
word
in
his
behalf
,
and
be
content
to
leave
him
to
a
long
continuance
of
his
harmless
existence
.
    
<EOS>
The
Censorious
Young
Gentleman
    
<EOS>
There
is
an
amiable
kind
of
young
gentleman
going
about
in
society
,
upon
whom
,
after
much
experience
of
him
,
and
considerable
turning
over
of
the
subject
in
our
mind
,
we
feel
it
our
duty
to
affix
the
above
appellation
.
 
<EOS>
Young
ladies
mildly
call
him
a
"
sarcastic
"
young
gentleman
,
or
a
"
severe
"
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
We
,
who
know
better
,
beg
to
acquaint
them
with
the
fact
,
that
he
is
merely
a
censorious
young
gentleman
,
and
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
The
censorious
young
gentleman
has
the
reputation
among
his
familiars
of
a
remarkably
clever
person
,
which
he
maintains
by
receiving
all
intelligence
and
expressing
all
opinions
with
a
dubious
sneer
,
accompanied
with
a
half
smile
,
expressive
of
anything
you
please
but
good
-
humour
.
 
<EOS>
This
sets
people
about
thinking
what
on
earth
<EOS>
the
censorious
young
gentleman
means
,
and
they
speedily
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
he
means
something
very
deep
indeed
;
for
they
reason
in
this
way
---
"
This
young
gentleman
looks
so
very
knowing
that
he
must
mean
something
,
and
as
I
am
by
no
means
<EOS>
a
dull
individual
,
what
a
very
deep
meaning
he
must
have
if
I
ca
n't
find
it
out
!
"
 
<EOS>
It
is
extraordinary
how
soon
a
censorious
young
gentleman
may
make
a
reputation
in
his
own
small
circle
if
he
bear
this
in
his
mind
,
and
regulate
his
proceedings
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
As
young
ladies
are
generally
---
not
curious
,
but
laudably
desirous
to
acquire
information
,
the
censorious
young
gentleman
is
much
talked
about
among
them
,
and
many
surmises
are
hazarded
regarding
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
,
"
exclaims
the
eldest
Miss
Greenwood
,
laying
down
her
work
to
turn
up
the
lamp
,
"
I
wonder
whether
Mr
Fairfax
will
ever
be
married
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Bless
me
,
dear
,
"
cries
Miss
Marshall
,
"
what
ever
made
you
think
of
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Really
I
hardly
know
,
"
replies
Miss
Greenwood
;
"
he
is
such
a
very
mysterious
person
,
that
I
often
wonder
about
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
"
replies
Miss
Marshall
,
"
and
so
do
I.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
two
other
young
ladies
profess
that
they
are
constantly
doing
the
like
,
and
all
present
appear
in
the
same
condition
except
one
young
lady
,
who
,
not
scrupling
to
state
that
she
considers
Mr
Fairfax
"
a
horror
,
"
draws
down
all
the
opposition
of
the
others
,
which
having
been
expressed
in
a
great
many
ejaculatory
passages
,
such
as
"
Well
,
did
I
ever
!
"
<EOS>
---
and
"
Lor
,
Emily
,
dear
!
"
<EOS>
ma
takes
up
the
subject
,
and
gravely
states
,
that
she
must
say
she
does
not
think
<EOS>
Mr
Fairfax
by
any
means
a
horror
,
but
rather
takes
him
to
be
a
young
man
of
very
great
ability
;
"
and
I
am
quite
sure
,
"
adds
the
worthy
lady
,
"
he
always
means
a
great
deal
more
than
he
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
The
door
opens
at
this
point
of
the
disclosure
,
and
who
of
all
people
alive
walks
into
the
room
,
but
the
very
Mr
Fairfax
,
who
has
been
the
subject
of
conversation
!
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
really
is
curious
,
"
cries
ma
,
"
we
were
at
that
very
moment
talking
about
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
did
me
great
honour
,
"
replies
Mr
Fairfax
;
"
may
I
venture
to
ask
what
you
were
saying
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
if
you
must
know
,
"
returns
the
eldest
girl
,
"
we
were
remarking
what
a
very
mysterious
man
you
are
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
!
"
observes
Mr
Fairfax
,
"
Indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
Now
Mr
Fairfax
says
this
ay
,
ay
,
and
indeed
,
which
are
slight
words
enough
in
themselves
,
with
so
very
unfathomable
an
air
,
and
accompanies
them
with
such
a
very
equivocal
smile
,
that
ma
and
the
young
ladies
are
more
than
ever
convinced
that
he
means
an
immensity
,
and
so
tell
him
he
is
a
very
dangerous
man
,
and
seems
to
be
always
thinking
ill
of
somebody
,
which
is
precisely
the
sort
of
character
<EOS>
the
censorious
young
gentleman
is
most
desirous
to
establish
;
wherefore
he
says
,
"
Oh
,
dear
,
no
,
"
in
a
tone
,
obviously
intended
to
mean
,
"
You
have
me
there
,
"
and
which
gives
them
to
understand
that
they
have
hit
the
right
nail
on
the
very
centre
of
its
head
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
conversation
ranges
from
the
mystery
overhanging
the
censorious
young
gentleman
's
behaviour
,
to
the
general
topics
of
the
day
,
he
sustains
his
character
to
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
He
considers
the
new
tragedy
<EOS>
well
enough
for
a
new
tragedy
,
but
Lord
bless
us
---
<EOS>
well
,
no
matter
;
he
could
say
a
great
deal
on
that
point
,
but
he
would
rather
not
,
lest
he
should
be
thought
ill
-
natured
,
as
he
knows
he
would
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
is
not
Mr
So
-
and
-
so
's
performance
truly
charming
?
<EOS>
"
inquires
a
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Charming
!
"
replies
the
censorious
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
,
yes
,
certainly
;
very
charming
---
oh
,
very
charming
indeed
.
"
 
<EOS>
After
this
,
he
stirs
the
fire
,
smiling
contemptuously
<EOS>
all
the
while
:
 
and
a
modest
young
gentleman
,
who
has
been
a
silent
listener
,
thinks
what
a
great
thing
it
must
be
,
to
have
such
a
critical
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
Of
music
,
pictures
,
books
,
and
poetry
,
the
censorious
young
gentleman
has
an
equally
fine
conception
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
men
and
women
,
he
can
tell
all
about
them
at
a
glance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
let
us
hear
your
opinion
of
young
Mrs
Barker
,
"
says
some
great
believer
in
the
powers
of
Mr
Fairfax
,
"
but
do
n't
be
too
severe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
am
severe
,
"
replies
the
censorious
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
never
mind
that
now
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
very
lady
-
like
,
is
she
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Lady
-
like
!
<EOS>
"
repeats
the
censorious
young
gentleman
(
for
he
always
repeats
when
he
is
at
a
loss
for
anything
to
say
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
observe
her
manner
?
 
<EOS>
Bless
my
heart
and
soul
,
Mrs
Thompson
<EOS>
,
did
you
observe
her
manner
?
<EOS>
---
that
's
all
I
ask
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
had
done
so
,
"
rejoins
the
poor
lady
,
much
perplexed
;
"
I
did
not
observe
it
very
closely
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
not
very
closely
,
"
rejoins
the
censorious
young
gentleman
,
triumphantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
good
;
then
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
talk
no
more
about
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
censorious
young
gentleman
purses
up
his
lips
,
and
nods
his
head
sagely
,
as
he
says
this
;
and
it
is
forthwith
whispered
about
,
that
Mr
Fairfax
(
who
,
though
he
is
a
little
prejudiced
,
must
be
admitted
to
be
a
very
excellent
judge
)
<EOS>
has
observed
something
exceedingly
odd
in
Mrs
Barker
's
manner
.
    
<EOS>
The
Funny
Young
Gentleman
    
<EOS>
As
one
funny
young
gentleman
will
serve
as
a
sample
of
all
funny
young
Gentlemen
we
purpose
merely
to
note
down
the
conduct
and
behaviour
of
an
individual
specimen
of
this
class
,
whom
we
happened
to
meet
at
an
annual
family
Christmas
party
in
the
course
of
this
very
last
Christmas
that
ever
came
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
all
seated
round
a
blazing
fire
which
crackled
pleasantly
as
the
guests
talked
merrily
and
the
urn
steamed
cheerily
---
for
,
being
an
old
-
fashioned
party
,
there
WAS
an
urn
,
and
a
teapot
besides
---
when
there
came
a
postman
's
knock
at
the
door
,
so
violent
and
sudden
,
that
it
startled
the
whole
circle
,
and
actually
caused
two
or
three
very
interesting
and
most
unaffected
young
ladies
to
scream
aloud
and
to
exhibit
many
afflicting
symptoms
of
terror
and
distress
,
until
they
had
been
several
times
assured
by
their
respective
adorers
,
that
they
were
in
no
danger
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
about
to
remark
that
it
was
surely
beyond
post
-
time
,
and
must
have
been
a
runaway
knock
,
when
our
host
,
who
had
hitherto
been
paralysed
with
wonder
,
sank
into
a
chair
in
a
perfect
ecstasy
of
laughter
,
and
offered
to
lay
twenty
pounds
that
it
was
that
droll
dog
Griggins
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
sooner
said
this
,
than
the
majority
of
the
company
and
all
the
children
of
the
house
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
too
,
as
if
some
inimitable
joke
flashed
upon
them
simultaneously
,
and
gave
vent
to
various
exclamations
of
---
To
be
sure
it
must
be
Griggins
,
and
How
like
him
that
was
,
and
What
spirits
he
was
always
in
!
<EOS>
with
many
other
commendatory
remarks
of
the
like
nature
.
  
<EOS>
Not
having
the
happiness
to
know
Griggins
,
we
became
extremely
desirous
to
see
so
pleasant
<EOS>
a
fellow
<EOS>
,
the
more
especially
as
a
stout
gentleman
with
a
powdered
head
,
who
was
sitting
with
his
breeches
buckles
almost
touching
the
hob
,
whispered
us
<EOS>
he
was
a
wit
of
the
first
water
,
when
the
door
opened
,
and
Mr
Griggins
being
announced
,
presented
himself
,
amidst
another
shout
of
laughter
and
a
loud
clapping
of
hands
from
the
younger
branches
.
 
<EOS>
This
welcome
he
acknowledged
by
sundry
contortions
of
countenance
,
imitative
of
the
clown
in
one
of
the
new
pantomimes
,
which
were
so
extremely
successful
,
that
one
stout
gentleman
rolled
upon
an
ottoman
in
a
paroxysm
of
delight
,
protesting
,
with
many
gasps
,
that
if
somebody
did
n't
make
that
fellow
Griggins
leave
off
,
he
would
be
the
death
of
him
,
he
knew
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
the
company
only
laughed
more
boisterously
than
before
,
and
as
we
always
like
to
accommodate
our
tone
and
spirit
if
possible
to
the
humour
of
any
society
in
which
we
find
ourself
,
we
laughed
with
the
rest
,
and
exclaimed
,
"
Oh
!
capital
,
capital
!
"
<EOS>
as
loud
as
any
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
quite
exhausted
all
beholders
,
Mr
Griggins
received
the
welcomes
and
congratulations
of
the
circle
,
and
went
through
the
needful
introductions
with
much
ease
and
many
puns
.
 
<EOS>
This
ceremony
over
,
he
avowed
his
intention
of
sitting
in
somebody
's
lap
unless
the
young
ladies
made
room
for
him
on
the
sofa
,
which
being
done
,
after
a
great
deal
of
tittering
and
pleasantry
,
he
squeezed
himself
among
them
,
and
likened
his
condition
to
that
of
love
among
the
roses
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
novel
jest
we
all
roared
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
should
consider
yourself
highly
honoured
,
sir
,
"
said
we
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Griggins
,
"
you
do
me
proud
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Here
everybody
laughed
again
;
and
the
stout
gentleman
by
the
fire
whispered
in
our
ear
that
Griggins
was
making
a
dead
set
at
us
.
  
<EOS>
The
tea
-
things
having
been
removed
,
we
all
sat
down
to
a
round
game
,
and
here
Mr
Griggins
shone
forth
with
peculiar
brilliancy
,
abstracting
other
people
's
fish
,
and
looking
over
their
hands
in
the
most
comical
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
one
most
excellent
joke
in
snuffing
a
candle
,
which
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
setting
fire
to
the
hair
of
a
pale
young
gentleman
who
sat
next
him
,
and
afterwards
begging
his
pardon
with
considerable
humour
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
young
gentleman
could
not
see
the
joke
however
,
possibly
in
consequence
of
its
being
on
the
top
of
his
own
head
,
it
did
not
go
off
quite
as
well
as
it
might
have
done
;
indeed
,
the
young
gentleman
was
heard
to
murmur
some
general
references
to
"
impertinence
,
"
and
a
"
rascal
,
"
and
to
state
the
number
of
his
lodgings
in
an
angry
tone
---
a
turn
of
the
conversation
which
might
have
been
productive
of
slaughterous
consequences
,
if
a
young
lady
,
betrothed
to
the
young
gentleman
,
had
not
used
her
immediate
influence
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
:
 
emphatically
declaring
in
an
agitated
whisper
,
intended
for
his
peculiar
edification
but
audible
to
the
whole
table
,
that
if
he
went
on
in
that
way
,
she
never
would
think
of
him
otherwise
than
as
a
friend
,
though
as
that
she
must
always
regard
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
terrible
threat
the
young
gentleman
became
calm
,
and
the
young
lady
,
overcome
by
the
revulsion
of
feeling
,
instantaneously
fainted
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Griggins
's
spirits
were
slightly
depressed
for
a
short
period
by
this
unlooked
-
for
result
of
such
a
harmless
pleasantry
,
but
being
promptly
elevated
by
the
attentions
of
the
host
and
several
glasses
of
wine
,
he
soon
recovered
,
and
became
even
more
vivacious
than
before
,
insomuch
that
the
stout
gentleman
previously
referred
to
,
assured
us
that
although
he
had
known
him
since
he
was
THAT
high
<EOS>
(
something
smaller
than
a
nutmeg
-
grater
)
,
he
had
never
beheld
him
in
such
excellent
cue
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
round
game
and
several
games
at
blind
man
's
buff
which
followed
it
were
all
over
,
and
we
were
going
down
to
supper
,
the
inexhaustible
Mr
Griggins
produced
a
small
sprig
of
mistletoe
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
and
commenced
a
general
kissing
of
the
assembled
females
,
which
occasioned
great
commotion
and
much
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
We
observed
that
several
young
gentlemen
---
including
the
young
gentleman
with
the
pale
countenance
---
were
greatly
scandalised
at
this
indecorous
proceeding
,
and
talked
very
big
among
themselves
in
corners
;
and
we
observed
too
,
that
several
young
ladies
when
remonstrated
with
by
the
aforesaid
young
gentlemen
,
called
each
other
to
witness
how
they
had
struggled
,
and
protested
vehemently
that
it
was
very
rude
,
and
that
they
were
surprised
at
Mrs
Brown
's
allowing
it
,
and
that
they
could
n't
bear
it
,
and
had
no
patience
with
such
impertinence
.
 
<EOS>
But
such
is
the
gentle
and
forgiving
nature
of
woman
,
that
although
we
looked
very
narrowly
for
it
,
we
could
not
detect
the
slightest
harshness
in
the
subsequent
treatment
of
Mr
Griggins
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
upon
the
whole
,
it
struck
us
that
among
the
ladies
he
seemed
rather
more
popular
than
before
!
  
<EOS>
To
recount
all
the
drollery
of
Mr
Griggins
at
supper
,
would
fill
such
a
tiny
volume
as
this
,
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
outside
cover
.
 
<EOS>
How
he
drank
out
of
other
people
's
glasses
,
and
ate
of
other
people
's
bread
,
how
he
frightened
into
screaming
convulsions
a
little
boy
who
was
sitting
up
to
supper
in
a
high
chair
,
by
sinking
below
the
table
and
suddenly
reappearing
with
a
mask
on
;
how
the
hostess
was
really
surprised
that
anybody
could
find
a
pleasure
in
tormenting
children
,
and
how
the
host
frowned
at
the
hostess
,
and
felt
convinced
that
Mr
Griggins
had
done
it
with
the
very
best
intentions
;
how
Mr
Griggins
explained
,
and
how
everybody
's
good
-
humour
was
restored
but
the
child
's
;
---
to
tell
these
and
a
hundred
other
things
ever
so
briefly
,
would
occupy
more
of
our
room
and
our
readers
'
patience
,
than
either
they
or
we
can
conveniently
spare
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
we
change
the
subject
,
merely
observing
that
we
have
offered
no
description
of
the
funny
young
gentleman
's
personal
appearance
,
believing
that
almost
every
society
has
a
Griggins
of
its
own
,
and
leaving
all
readers
to
supply
the
deficiency
,
according
to
the
particular
circumstances
of
their
particular
case
.

The
Theatrical
Young
Gentleman
    
<EOS>
All
gentlemen
who
love
the
drama
---
<EOS>
and
there
are
few
gentlemen
who
are
not
attached
to
the
most
intellectual
and
rational
of
all
our
amusements
---
<EOS>
do
not
come
within
this
definition
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
have
no
mean
relish
for
theatrical
entertainments
<EOS>
ourself
,
we
are
disinterestedly
anxious
that
this
should
be
perfectly
understood
.
  
<EOS>
The
theatrical
young
gentleman
has
early
and
important
information
on
all
theatrical
topics
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
says
he
,
abruptly
,
when
you
meet
him
in
the
street
,
"
here
's
a
pretty
to
-
do
.
 
<EOS>
Flimkins
has
thrown
up
his
part
in
the
melodrama
at
the
Surrey
.
"
---
"
And
what
's
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
"
you
inquire
with
as
much
gravity
as
you
can
counterfeit
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
that
's
the
point
,
"
replies
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
,
looking
very
serious
;
"
Boozle
declines
it
;
positively
declines
it
.
<EOS>
From
all
I
am
told
,
I
should
say
it
was
decidedly
in
Boozle
's
line
,
and
that
he
would
be
very
likely
to
make
a
great
hit
in
it
;
but
he
objects
on
the
ground
of
Flimkins
having
been
put
up
in
the
part
first
,
and
says
no
earthly
power
shall
induce
him
to
take
the
character
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
fine
part
,
too
---
excellent
business
,
I
'm
told
.
<EOS>
He
has
to
kill
six
people
in
the
course
of
the
piece
,
and
to
fight
over
a
bridge
in
red
fire
,
which
is
as
safe
a
card
,
you
know
,
as
can
be
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
mention
it
;
but
I
hear
that
the
last
scene
,
when
he
is
first
poisoned
,
and
then
stabbed
,
by
Mrs
Flimkins
as
Vengedora
,
will
be
the
greatest
thing
that
has
been
done
these
many
years
.
<EOS>
"
With
this
piece
of
news
,
and
laying
his
finger
on
his
lips
as
a
caution
for
you
not
to
excite
the
town
with
it
,
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
hurries
away
.
  
<EOS>
The
theatrical
young
gentleman
,
from
often
frequenting
the
different
theatrical
establishments
,
has
pet
and
familiar
names
for
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
Covent
-
Garden
is
the
garden
,
Drury
-
Lane
the
lane
,
the
Victoria
the
vic
,
and
the
Olympic
the
pic
.
 
<EOS>
Actresses
,
too
,
are
always
designated
by
their
surnames
only
,
as
Taylor
,
Nisbett
,
Faucit
,
Honey
;
that
talented
and
lady
-
like
girl
Sheriff
,
that
clever
little
creature
Horton
,
and
so
on
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
same
manner
he
prefixes
Christian
names
when
he
mentions
actors
,
as
Charley
Young
,
Jemmy
Buckstone
,
Fred
.
<EOS>
Yates
,
Paul
Bedford
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
is
at
a
loss
for
a
Christian
name
,
the
word
"
old
"
applied
indiscriminately
answers
quite
as
well
:
 
as
old
Charley
Matthews
at
Vestris
's
,
old
Harley
,
and
old
Braham
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
great
knowledge
of
the
private
proceedings
of
actresses
,
especially
of
their
getting
married
,
and
can
tell
you
in
a
breath
half
-
a
-
dozen
who
have
changed
their
names
without
avowing
it
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
an
alteration
of
this
kind
is
made
in
the
playbills
,
he
will
remind
you
that
he
let
you
into
the
secret
six
months
ago
.
  
<EOS>
The
theatrical
young
gentleman
has
a
great
reverence
for
all
that
is
connected
with
the
stage
department
of
the
different
theatres
.
<EOS>
He
would
,
at
any
time
,
prefer
going
a
street
or
two
out
of
his
way
,
to
omitting
to
pass
a
stage
-
entrance
,
into
which
he
always
looks
with
a
curious
and
searching
eye
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
can
only
identify
a
popular
actor
in
the
street
,
he
is
in
a
perfect
transport
of
delight
;
and
no
sooner
meets
him
,
than
he
hurries
back
,
and
walks
a
few
paces
in
front
of
him
,
so
that
he
can
turn
round
from
time
to
time
,
and
have
a
good
stare
at
his
features
.
 
<EOS>
He
looks
upon
a
theatrical
-
fund
dinner
as
one
of
the
most
enchanting
festivities
ever
known
;
and
thinks
that
to
be
a
member
of
the
Garrick
Club
,
and
see
so
many
actors
in
their
plain
clothes
,
must
be
one
of
the
highest
gratifications
the
world
can
bestow
.
  
<EOS>
The
theatrical
young
gentleman
is
a
constant
half
-
price
visitor
at
one
or
other
of
the
theatres
,
and
has
an
infinite
relish
for
all
pieces
which
display
the
fullest
resources
of
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
He
likes
to
place
implicit
reliance
upon
the
play
-
bills
when
he
goes
to
see
a
show
-
piece
,
and
works
himself
up
to
such
a
pitch
of
enthusiasm
,
as
not
only
to
believe
(
if
the
bills
say
so
)
that
there
are
three
hundred
and
seventy
-
five
people
on
the
stage
at
one
time
in
the
last
scene
,
but
is
highly
indignant
with
you
,
unless
you
believe
it
also
.
 
<EOS>
He
considers
that
if
the
stage
be
opened
from
the
foot
-
lights
to
the
back
wall
,
in
any
new
play
,
the
piece
is
a
triumph
of
dramatic
writing
,
and
applauds
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
great
notion
of
trap
-
doors
too
;
and
thinks
any
character
going
down
or
coming
up
a
trap
(
no
matter
whether
he
be
an
angel
or
a
demon
---
they
both
do
it
occasionally
)
<EOS>
one
of
the
most
interesting
feats
in
the
whole
range
of
scenic
illusion
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
these
acquirements
,
he
has
several
veracious
accounts
to
communicate
of
the
private
manners
and
customs
of
different
actors
,
which
,
during
the
pauses
of
a
quadrille
,
he
usually
communicates
to
his
partner
,
or
imparts
to
his
neighbour
at
a
supper
table
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
he
is
advised
,
that
Mr
Liston
always
had
a
footman
in
gorgeous
livery
waiting
at
the
side
-
scene
with
a
brandy
bottle
and
tumbler
,
to
administer
half
a
pint
or
so
of
spirit
to
him
every
time
he
came
off
,
without
which
assistance
he
must
infallibly
have
fainted
.
 
<EOS>
He
knows
for
a
fact
,
that
,
after
an
arduous
part
,
Mr
George
Bennett
is
put
between
two
feather
beds
,
to
absorb
the
perspiration
;
and
is
credibly
informed
,
that
Mr
Baker
has
,
for
many
years
,
submitted
to
a
course
of
lukewarm
toast
-
and
-
water
,
to
qualify
him
to
sustain
his
favourite
characters
.
 
<EOS>
He
looks
upon
Mr
Fitz
Ball
as
the
principal
dramatic
genius
and
poet
of
the
day
;
but
holds
that
there
are
great
writers
extant
besides
him
,
---
<EOS>
in
proof
whereof
he
refers
you
to
various
dramas
and
melodramas
recently
produced
,
of
which
he
takes
in
all
the
sixpenny
and
three
-
penny
editions
as
fast
as
they
appear
.
  
<EOS>
The
theatrical
young
gentleman
is
a
great
advocate
for
violence
of
emotion
and
redundancy
of
action
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
father
has
to
curse
a
child
upon
the
stage
,
he
likes
to
see
it
done
in
the
thorough
-
going
style
,
with
no
mistake
about
it
:
 
to
which
end
it
is
essential
that
the
child
should
follow
the
father
on
her
knees
,
and
be
knocked
violently
over
on
her
face
by
the
old
gentleman
as
he
goes
into
a
small
cottage
,
and
shuts
the
door
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
likes
to
see
a
blessing
invoked
upon
the
young
lady
,
when
the
old
gentleman
repents
,
with
equal
earnestness
,
and
accompanied
by
the
usual
conventional
forms
,
which
consist
of
the
old
gentleman
looking
anxiously
up
into
the
clouds
,
as
if
to
see
whether
it
rains
,
and
then
spreading
an
imaginary
tablecloth
in
the
air
over
the
young
lady
's
head
---
soft
music
playing
all
the
while
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
these
,
and
other
points
of
a
similar
kind
,
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
is
a
great
critic
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
likewise
very
acute
in
judging
of
natural
expressions
of
the
passions
,
and
knows
precisely
the
frown
,
wink
,
nod
,
or
leer
,
which
stands
for
any
one
of
them
,
or
the
means
by
which
it
may
be
converted
into
any
other
:
 
as
jealousy
,
with
a
good
stamp
of
the
right
foot
,
becomes
anger
;
or
wildness
,
with
the
hands
clasped
before
the
throat
,
instead
of
tearing
the
wig
,
is
passionate
love
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
venture
to
express
a
doubt
of
the
accuracy
of
any
of
these
portraitures
,
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
assures
you
,
with
a
haughty
smile
,
that
it
always
has
been
done
in
that
way
,
and
he
supposes
they
are
not
going
to
change
it
at
this
time
of
day
to
please
you
;
to
which
,
of
course
,
you
meekly
reply
that
you
suppose
not
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
innumerable
disquisitions
of
this
nature
,
in
which
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
is
very
profound
,
especially
to
ladies
whom
he
is
most
in
the
habit
of
entertaining
with
them
;
but
as
we
have
no
space
to
recapitulate
them
at
greater
length
,
we
must
rest
content
with
calling
the
attention
of
the
young
ladies
in
general
to
the
theatrical
young
gentlemen
of
their
own
acquaintance
.
    
<EOS>
The
Poetical
Young
Gentleman
    
Time
was
,
and
not
very
long
ago
either
,
when
a
singular
epidemic
raged
among
the
young
gentlemen
,
vast
numbers
of
whom
,
under
the
influence
of
the
malady
,
tore
off
their
neckerchiefs
,
turned
down
their
shirt
collars
,
and
exhibited
themselves
in
the
open
streets
with
bare
throats
and
dejected
countenances
,
before
the
eyes
of
an
astonished
public
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
poetical
young
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
The
custom
was
gradually
found
to
be
inconvenient
,
as
involving
the
necessity
of
too
much
clean
linen
and
too
large
washing
bills
,
and
these
outward
symptoms
have
consequently
passed
away
;
but
we
are
disposed
to
think
,
notwithstanding
,
that
the
number
of
poetical
young
gentlemen
is
considerably
on
the
increase
.
  
<EOS>
We
know
a
poetical
young
gentleman
---
a
very
poetical
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
not
mean
to
say
that
he
is
troubled
with
the
gift
of
poesy
in
any
remarkable
degree
,
but
his
countenance
is
of
a
plaintive
and
melancholy
cast
,
his
manner
is
abstracted
and
bespeaks
affliction
of
soul
:
 
<EOS>
he
seldom
has
his
hair
cut
,
and
often
talks
about
being
an
outcast
and
wanting
a
kindred
spirit
;
from
which
,
as
well
as
from
many
general
observations
in
which
he
is
wo
nt
to
indulge
,
concerning
mysterious
impulses
,
and
yearnings
of
the
heart
,
and
the
supremacy
of
intellect
gilding
all
earthly
things
with
the
glowing
magic
of
immortal
verse
,
it
is
clear
to
all
his
friends
that
he
has
been
stricken
poetical
.
  
<EOS>
The
favourite
attitude
of
the
poetical
young
gentleman
is
lounging
on
a
sofa
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ceiling
,
or
sitting
bolt
upright
in
a
high
-
backed
chair
,
staring
with
very
round
eyes
at
the
opposite
wall
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
is
in
one
of
these
positions
,
his
mother
,
who
is
a
worthy
,
affectionate
old
soul
,
will
give
you
a
nudge
to
bespeak
your
attention
without
disturbing
the
abstracted
one
,
and
whisper
with
a
shake
of
the
head
,
that
John
's
imagination
is
at
some
extraordinary
work
or
other
,
you
may
take
her
word
for
it
.
<EOS>
Hereupon
John
looks
more
fiercely
intent
upon
vacancy
than
before
,
and
suddenly
snatching
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
,
puts
down
three
words
,
and
a
cross
on
the
back
of
a
card
,
sighs
deeply
,
paces
once
or
twice
across
the
room
,
inflicts
a
most
unmerciful
slap
upon
his
head
,
and
walks
moodily
up
to
his
dormitory
.
  
<EOS>
The
poetical
young
gentleman
is
apt
to
acquire
peculiar
notions
of
things
too
,
<EOS>
which
plain
ordinary
people
,
unblessed
with
a
poetical
obliquity
of
vision
,
would
suppose
to
be
rather
distorted
.
 
<EOS>
For
instance
,
when
the
sickening
murder
and
mangling
of
a
wretched
woman
was
affording
delicious
food
wherewithal
to
gorge
the
insatiable
curiosity
of
the
public
,
our
friend
the
poetical
young
gentleman
was
in
ecstasies
---
not
of
disgust
,
but
admiration
.
<EOS>
"
Heavens
!
"
cried
the
poetical
young
gentleman
,
"
<EOS>
how
grand
;
how
great
!
"
 
<EOS>
We
ventured
deferentially
to
inquire
upon
whom
these
epithets
were
bestowed
:
 
our
humble
thoughts
oscillating
between
the
police
officer
who
found
the
criminal
,
and
the
lock
-
keeper
who
found
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Upon
whom
!
"
exclaimed
the
poetical
young
gentleman
in
a
frenzy
of
poetry
,
"
Upon
whom
should
they
be
bestowed
but
upon
the
murderer
!
"
<EOS>
---
and
thereupon
it
came
out
,
in
a
fine
torrent
of
eloquence
,
that
the
murderer
was
a
great
spirit
,
a
bold
creature
full
of
daring
and
nerve
,
a
man
of
dauntless
heart
and
determined
courage
,
and
withal
a
great
casuist
and
able
reasoner
,
as
was
fully
demonstrated
in
his
philosophical
colloquies
with
the
great
and
noble
of
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
We
held
our
peace
,
and
meekly
signified
our
indisposition
to
controvert
these
opinions
---
firstly
,
because
we
were
no
match
at
quotation
for
the
poetical
young
gentleman
;
and
secondly
,
because
we
felt
it
would
be
of
little
use
our
entering
into
any
disputation
,
if
we
were
:
 
being
perfectly
convinced
that
the
respectable
and
immoral
hero
in
question
is
not
the
first
and
will
not
be
the
last
hanged
gentleman
upon
whom
false
sympathy
or
diseased
curiosity
will
be
plentifully
expended
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
stern
mystic
flight
of
the
poetical
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
milder
and
softer
moments
he
occasionally
lays
down
his
neckcloth
,
and
pens
stanzas
,
which
sometimes
find
their
way
into
a
Lady
's
Magazine
,
or
the
"
Poets
'
Corner
"
of
some
country
newspaper
;
or
which
,
in
default
of
either
vent
for
his
genius
,
adorn
the
rainbow
leaves
of
a
lady
's
album
.
 
<EOS>
These
are
generally
written
upon
some
such
occasions
as
contemplating
the
Bank
of
England
by
midnight
,
or
beholding
Saint
Paul
's
in
a
snow
-
storm
;
and
when
these
gloomy
objects
fail
to
afford
him
inspiration
,
he
pours
forth
his
soul
in
a
touching
address
to
a
violet
,
or
a
plaintive
lament
that
he
is
no
longer
a
child
,
but
has
gradually
grown
up
.
  
<EOS>
The
poetical
young
gentleman
is
fond
of
quoting
passages
from
his
favourite
authors
,
who
are
all
of
the
gloomy
and
desponding
school
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
great
deal
to
say
too
about
the
world
,
and
is
much
given
to
opining
,
especially
if
he
has
taken
anything
strong
to
drink
,
that
there
is
nothing
in
it
worth
living
for
.
 
<EOS>
He
gives
you
to
understand
,
however
,
that
for
the
sake
of
society
,
he
means
to
bear
his
part
in
the
tiresome
play
,
manfully
resisting
the
gratification
of
his
own
strong
desire
to
make
a
premature
exit
;
and
consoles
himself
with
the
reflection
,
<EOS>
that
immortality
has
some
chosen
nook
for
himself
and
the
other
great
spirits
whom
earth
has
chafed
and
wearied
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
poetical
young
gentleman
makes
use
of
adjectives
,
they
are
all
superlatives
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
is
of
the
grandest
,
greatest
,
noblest
,
mightiest
,
loftiest
;
or
the
lowest
,
meanest
,
obscurest
,
vilest
,
and
most
pitiful
.
 
<EOS>
He
knows
no
medium
:
 
for
enthusiasm
<EOS>
is
the
soul
of
poetry
;
and
who
so
enthusiastic
as
a
poetical
young
gentleman
?
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Milkwash
,
"
says
a
young
lady
as
she
unlocks
her
album
to
receive
the
young
gentleman
's
original
impromptu
contribution
,
"
how
very
silent
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
must
be
in
love
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Love
!
"
<EOS>
cries
the
poetical
young
gentleman
,
starting
from
his
seat
by
the
fire
and
terrifying
the
cat
who
scampers
off
at
full
speed
,
"
Love
!
<EOS>
that
burning
,
consuming
passion
;
that
ardour
of
the
soul
,
that
fierce
glowing
of
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Love
!
 
<EOS>
The
withering
,
blighting
influence
of
hope
misplaced
and
affection
slighted
.
 
<EOS>
Love
did
you
say
!
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha

"
  
<EOS>
With
this
,
the
poetical
young
gentleman
laughs
a
laugh
belonging
only
to
poets
and
Mr
O%
Smith
of
the
Adelphi
Theatre
,
and
sits
down
,
pen
in
hand
,
to
throw
off
a
page
or
two
of
verse
in
the
biting
,
semi
-
atheistical
demoniac
style
,
which
,
like
the
poetical
young
gentleman
himself
,
is
full
of
sound
and
fury
,
signifying
nothing
.

The
"
throwing
-
Off
"
Young
Gentleman
    
<EOS>
There
is
a
certain
kind
of
impostor
---
a
bragging
,
vaunting
,
puffing
young
gentleman
---
against
whom
we
are
desirous
to
warn
that
fairer
part
of
the
creation
,
to
whom
we
more
peculiarly
devote
these
our
labours
.
 
<EOS>
And
we
are
particularly
induced
to
lay
especial
stress
upon
this
division
of
our
subject
,
by
a
little
dialogue
we
held
some
short
time
ago
,
with
an
esteemed
young
lady
of
our
acquaintance
,
touching
a
most
gross
specimen
of
this
class
of
men
.
<EOS>
We
had
been
urging
all
the
absurdities
of
his
conduct
and
conversation
,
and
dwelling
upon
the
impossibilities
he
constantly
recounted
---
to
which
indeed
we
had
not
scrupled
to
prefix
a
certain
hard
little
word
of
one
syllable
and
three
letters
---
when
our
fair
friend
,
unable
to
maintain
the
contest
any
longer
,
reluctantly
cried
,
"
Well
;
he
certainly
has
a
habit
of
throwing
-
off
,
but
<EOS>
then
---
"
 
<EOS>
What
then
?
 
<EOS>
Throw
him
off
yourself
,
said
we
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
she
did
,
but
not
at
our
instance
,
for
other
reasons
appeared
,
and
it
might
have
been
better
if
she
had
done
so
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
The
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
has
so
often
a
father
possessed
of
vast
property
in
some
remote
district
of
Ireland
,
that
we
look
with
some
suspicion
upon
all
young
gentlemen
who
volunteer
this
description
of
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
The
deceased
grandfather
of
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
was
a
man
of
immense
possessions
,
and
untold
wealth
;
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
remembers
,
as
well
as
if
it
were
only
yesterday
,
the
deceased
baronet
's
library
,
with
its
long
rows
of
scarce
and
valuable
books
in
superbly
embossed
bindings
,
arranged
in
cases
,
reaching
from
the
lofty
ceiling
to
the
oaken
floor
;
and
the
fine
antique
chairs
and
tables
,
and
the
noble
old
castle
of
Ballykillbabaloo
,
with
its
splendid
prospect
of
hill
and
dale
,
and
wood
,
and
rich
wild
scenery
,
and
the
fine
hunting
stables
and
the
spacious
court
-
yards
,
"
and
---
and
---
everything
upon
the
same
magnificent
scale
,
"
says
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
,
"
princely
;
quite
princely
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
sighs
as
if
mourning
over
the
fallen
fortunes
of
his
noble
house
.
  
<EOS>
The
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
is
a
universal
genius
;
at
walking
,
running
,
rowing
,
swimming
,
and
skating
,
he
is
unrivalled
;
at
all
games
of
chance
or
skill
,
at
hunting
,
shooting
,
fishing
,
riding
,
driving
,
or
amateur
theatricals
,
no
one
can
touch
him
---
that
is
COULD
not
,
because
he
gives
you
carefully
to
understand
,
lest
there
should
be
any
opportunity
of
testing
his
skill
,
that
he
is
quite
out
of
practice
just
now
,
and
has
been
for
some
years
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
mention
any
beautiful
girl
of
your
common
acquaintance
in
his
hearing
,
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
starts
,
smiles
,
and
begs
<EOS>
you
not
to
mind
him
,
for
it
was
quite
involuntary
:
 
people
do
say
indeed
that
they
were
once
engaged
,
but
no
---
although
she
is
a
very
fine
girl
,
he
was
so
situated
at
that
time
that
he
could
n't
possibly
encourage
the
---
<EOS>
"
but
it
's
of
no
use
talking
about
it
!
"
<EOS>
he
adds
,
interrupting
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
got
over
it
now
,
and
<EOS>
I
firmly
hope
and
trust
is
happy
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
benevolent
aspiration
he
nods
his
head
in
a
mysterious
manner
,
and
whistling
the
first
part
of
some
popular
air
,
thinks
perhaps
it
will
be
better
to
change
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
another
great
characteristic
of
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
,
which
is
,
that
he
"
happens
to
be
acquainted
"
with
a
most
extraordinary
variety
of
people
in
all
parts
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
in
all
disputed
questions
,
when
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
has
no
argument
to
bring
forward
,
he
invariably
happens
to
be
acquainted
with
some
distant
person
,
intimately
connected
with
the
subject
,
whose
testimony
decides
the
point
against
you
,
to
the
great
<EOS>
---
may
we
say
it
---
to
the
great
admiration
of
three
young
ladies
out
of
every
four
,
who
consider
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
a
very
highly
-
connected
young
man
,
and
a
most
charming
person
.
  
<EOS>
Sometimes
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
happens
to
look
in
upon
a
little
family
circle
of
young
ladies
who
are
quietly
spending
the
evening
together
,
and
then
indeed
is
he
at
the
very
height
and
summit
of
his
glory
;
for
it
is
to
be
observed
that
he
by
no
means
shines
to
equal
advantage
in
the
presence
of
men
as
in
the
society
of
over
-
credulous
young
ladies
,
which
is
his
proper
element
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
delightful
to
hear
the
number
of
pretty
things
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
gives
utterance
to
,
during
tea
,
and
still
more
so
to
observe
the
ease
with
which
,
from
long
practice
and
study
,
he
delicately
blends
one
compliment
to
a
lady
with
two
for
himself
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
see
a
more
lovely
blue
than
this
flower
,
Mr
Caveton
?
"
asks
a
young
lady
who
,
truth
to
tell
,
is
rather
smitten
with
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
he
replies
,
bending
over
the
object
of
admiration
,
"
never
but
in
your
eyes
.
"
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr
Caveton
,
"
cries
the
young
lady
,
blushing
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Indeed
I
speak
the
truth
,
"
replies
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
,
"
I
never
saw
any
approach
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
used
to
think
my
cousin
's
blue
eyes
lovely
,
but
they
grow
dim
and
colourless
beside
yours
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
a
beautiful
cousin
,
Mr
Caveton
!
"
replies
the
young
lady
,
with
that
perfect
artlessness
which
is
the
distinguishing
characteristic
of
all
young
ladies
;
"
an
affair
,
of
course
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
indeed
,
indeed
you
wrong
me
,
"
rejoins
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
with
great
energy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
fervently
hope
that
her
attachment
towards
me
may
be
nothing
but
the
natural
result
of
our
close
intimacy
in
childhood
,
and
that
in
change
of
scene
and
among
new
faces
she
may
soon
overcome
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
her
!
 
<EOS>
Think
not
so
meanly
of
me
,
Miss
Lowfield
<EOS>
,
I
beseech
,
as
to
suppose
that
title
,
lands
,
riches
,
and
beauty
,
can
influence
MY
choice

The

the

Here
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
sinks
his
voice
to
a
still
lower
whisper
;
and
the
young
lady
duly
proclaims
to
all
the
other
young
ladies
when
they
go
up
-
stairs
,
to
put
their
bonnets
on
,
that
Mr
Caveton
's
relations
are
all
immensely
rich
,
and
that
he
is
hopelessly
beloved
by
title
,
lands
,
riches
,
and
beauty

<EOS>
We
have
seen
a
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
who
,
to
our
certain
knowledge
,
was
innocent
of
a
note
of
music
,
and
scarcely
able
to
recognise
a
tune
by
ear
,
volunteer
a
Spanish
air
upon
the
guitar
when
he
had
previously
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
not
such
an
instrument
within
a
mile
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
heard
another
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
,
after
striking
a
note
or
two
upon
the
piano
,
and
accompanying
it
correctly
(
by
dint
of
laborious
practice
)
with
his
voice
,
assure
a
circle
of
wondering
listeners
that
so
acute
was
his
ear
that
he
was
wholly
unable
to
sing
out
of
tune
,
let
him
try
as
he
would

<EOS>
We
have
lived
to
witness
the
unmasking
of
another
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
,
who
went
out
a
visiting
in
a
military
cap
with
a
gold
band
and
tassel
,
and
who
,
after
passing
successfully
for
a
captain
and
being
lauded
to
the
skies
for
his
red
whiskers
,
his
bravery
,
his
soldierly
bearing
and
his
pride
,
turned
out
to
be
the
dishonest
son
of
an
honest
linen
-
draper
in
a
small
country
town
,
and
whom
,
if
it
were
not
for
this
fortunate
exposure
,
we
should
not
yet
despair
of
encountering
as
the
fortunate
husband
of
some
rich
heiress
.
<EOS>
Ladies
,
ladies
,
the
throwing

off
young
gentlemen
are
often
swindlers
,
and
always
fools

So
pray
you
avoid
them

The
Young
Ladies
'
Young
Gentleman
    
<EOS>
This
young
gentleman
has
several
titles
.
 
<EOS>
Some
young
ladies
consider
him
"
a
nice
young
man
,
"
others
"
a
fine
young
man
,
"
others
"
quite
a
lady
's
man
,
"
others
"
a
handsome
man
,
"
others
"
a
remarkably
good
-
looking
young
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
some
young
ladies
he
is
"
a
perfect
angel
,
"
and
with
others
"
quite
a
love
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
is
likewise
a
charming
creature
,
a
duck
,
and
a
dear
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
'
young
gentleman
has
usually
a
fresh
colour
and
very
white
teeth
,
which
latter
articles
,
<EOS>
of
course
,
he
displays
on
every
possible
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
brown
or
black
hair
,
and
whiskers
of
the
same
,
if
possible
;
but
a
slight
tinge
of
red
,
or
the
hue
which
is
vulgarly
known
as
SANDY
,
is
not
considered
an
objection
.
 
<EOS>
If
his
head
and
face
be
large
,
his
nose
prominent
,
and
his
figure
square
,
he
is
an
uncommonly
fine
young
man
,
and
worshipped
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
Should
his
whiskers
meet
beneath
his
chin
,
so
much
the
better
,
though
this
is
not
absolutely
insisted
on
;
but
he
must
wear
an
under
-
waistcoat
,
and
smile
constantly
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
party
got
up
by
some
party
-
loving
friends
of
ours
last
summer
,
to
go
and
dine
in
Epping
Forest
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
hold
that
such
wild
expeditions
should
never
be
indulged
in
,
save
by
people
of
the
smallest
means
,
who
have
no
dinner
at
home
,
we
should
indubitably
have
excused
ourself
from
attending
,
if
we
had
not
recollected
that
the
projectors
of
the
excursion
were
always
accompanied
on
such
occasions
by
a
choice
sample
of
the
young
ladies
'
young
gentleman
,
whom
we
were
very
anxious
to
have
an
opportunity
of
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
This
determined
us
,
and
we
went
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
to
make
for
Chigwell
in
four
glass
coaches
,
each
with
a
trifling
company
of
six
or
eight
inside
,
and
a
little
boy
belonging
to
the
projectors
on
the
box
---
and
to
start
from
the
residence
of
the
projectors
,
Woburn
-
place
,
Russell
-
square
,
at
half
-
past
ten
precisely
.
 
<EOS>
We
arrived
at
the
place
of
rendezvous
at
the
appointed
time
,
and
found
the
glass
coaches
and
the
little
boys
quite
ready
,
and
divers
young
ladies
and
young
gentlemen
looking
anxiously
over
the
breakfast
-
parlour
blinds
,
who
appeared
by
no
means
so
much
gratified
by
our
approach
as
we
might
have
expected
,
but
evidently
wished
we
had
been
somebody
else
.
 
<EOS>
Observing
that
our
arrival
in
lieu
of
the
unknown
occasioned
some
disappointment
,
we
ventured
to
inquire
who
was
yet
to
come
,
when
we
found
from
the
hasty
reply
of
a
dozen
voices
,
that
it
was
no
other
than
the
young
ladies
'
young
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
imagine
,
"
said
the
mamma
,
"
what
has
become
of
Mr
Balim
---
always
so
punctual
,
always
so
pleasant
and
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
can
-
NOT
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
these
last
words
were
uttered
in
that
measured
,
emphatic
manner
which
painfully
announces
that
the
speaker
has
not
quite
made
up
his
or
her
mind
what
to
say
,
but
is
determined
to
talk
on
nevertheless
,
the
eldest
daughter
took
up
the
subject
,
and
hoped
no
accident
had
happened
to
Mr
Balim
,
upon
which
there
was
a
general
chorus
of
"
Dear
Mr
Balim
!
"
and
one
young
lady
,
more
adventurous
than
the
rest
,
proposed
that
an
express
should
be
straightway
sent
to
dear
Mr
Balim
's
lodgings
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
the
papa
resolutely
opposed
,
observing
,
in
what
a
short
young
lady
behind
us
termed
"
quite
a
bearish
way
,
"
that
if
Mr
Balim
did
n't
choose
to
come
,
he
might
stop
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
all
the
daughters
raised
a
murmur
of
"
Oh
pa
!
"
except
one
sprightly
little
girl
of
eight
or
ten
years
old
,
who
,
taking
advantage
of
a
pause
in
the
discourse
,
remarked
,
that
perhaps
Mr
Balim
might
have
been
married
that
morning
---
for
which
impertinent
suggestion
she
was
summarily
ejected
from
the
room
by
her
eldest
sister
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
all
in
a
state
of
great
mortification
and
uneasiness
,
when
one
of
the
little
boys
,
running
into
the
room
as
airily
as
little
boys
usually
run
who
have
an
unlimited
allowance
of
animal
food
in
the
holidays
,
and
keep
their
hands
constantly
forced
down
to
the
bottoms
of
very
deep
trouser
-
pockets
when
they
take
exercise
,
<EOS>
joyfully
announced
that
Mr
Balim
was
at
that
moment
coming
up
the
street
in
a
hackney
-
cab
;
and
the
intelligence
was
confirmed
beyond
all
doubt
a
minute
afterwards
by
the
entry
of
Mr
Balim
himself
,
who
was
received
with
repeated
cries
of
"
Where
have
you
been
,
you
naughty
creature
?
"
<EOS>
whereunto
the
naughty
creature
replied
,
that
he
had
been
in
bed
,
in
consequence
of
a
late
party
the
night
before
,
and
had
only
just
risen
.
 
<EOS>
The
acknowledgment
awakened
a
variety
of
agonizing
fears
that
he
had
taken
no
breakfast
;
which
appearing
after
a
slight
cross
-
examination
to
be
the
real
state
of
the
case
,
breakfast
for
one
was
immediately
ordered
,
notwithstanding
Mr
Balim
's
repeated
protestations
that
he
could
n't
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
think
of
it
though
,
and
thought
better
of
it
too
,
for
he
made
a
remarkably
good
meal
when
it
came
,
and
was
assiduously
served
by
a
select
knot
of
young
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
delightful
to
see
how
he
ate
and
drank
,
while
one
pair
of
fair
hands
poured
out
his
coffee
,
and
another
put
in
the
sugar
,
and
another
the
milk
;
the
rest
of
the
company
ever
and
anon
casting
angry
glances
at
their
watches
,
and
the
glass
coaches
,
---
and
the
little
boys
looking
on
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
lest
it
should
begin
to
rain
before
we
set
out
;
it
might
have
rained
all
day
,
after
we
were
once
too
far
to
turn
back
again
,
and
welcome
,
for
aught
they
cared
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
the
cavalcade
moved
at
length
,
every
coachman
being
accommodated
with
a
hamper
between
his
legs
something
larger
than
a
wheelbarrow
;
and
the
company
being
packed
as
closely
as
they
possibly
could
in
the
carriages
,
"
according
,
"
as
one
married
lady
observed
,
"
to
the
immemorial
custom
,
which
was
half
the
diversion
of
gipsy
parties
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thinking
it
very
likely
it
might
be
<EOS>
(
we
have
never
been
able
to
discover
the
other
half
)
,
we
submitted
to
be
stowed
away
with
a
cheerful
aspect
,
and
were
fortunate
enough
to
occupy
one
corner
of
a
coach
in
which
were
one
old
lady
,
four
young
ladies
,
and
the
renowned
Mr
Balim
the
young
ladies
'
young
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
no
sooner
fairly
off
,
than
the
young
ladies
'
young
gentleman
hummed
a
fragment
of
an
air
,
which
induced
a
young
lady
to
inquire
whether
he
had
danced
to
that
the
night
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
Heaven
,
then
,
I
did
,
"
replied
the
young
gentleman
,
"
and
with
a
lovely
heiress
;
a
superb
creature
,
with
twenty
thousand
pounds
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
seem
rather
struck
,
"
observed
another
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Gad
she
was
a
sweet
creature
,
"
returned
the
young
gentleman
,
arranging
his
hair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
SHE
was
struck
too
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
first
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
ask
,
love
?
"
<EOS>
interposed
the
second
;
"
could
she
fail
to
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
honestly
I
think
she
was
,
"
observed
the
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
point
of
the
dialogue
,
the
young
lady
who
had
spoken
first
,
and
who
sat
on
the
young
gentleman
's
right
,
struck
him
a
severe
blow
on
the
arm
with
a
rosebud
,
and
said
he
was
a
vain
man
---
whereupon
the
young
gentleman
insisted
on
having
the
rosebud
,
and
the
young
lady
appealing
for
help
to
the
other
young
ladies
,
a
charming
struggle
ensued
,
terminating
in
the
victory
of
the
young
gentleman
,
and
the
capture
of
the
rosebud
.
 
<EOS>
This
little
skirmish
over
<EOS>
,
the
married
lady
,
who
was
the
mother
of
the
rosebud
,
smiled
sweetly
upon
the
young
gentleman
,
and
accused
him
of
being
a
flirt
;
the
young
gentleman
pleading
not
guilty
,
a
most
interesting
discussion
took
place
upon
the
important
point
whether
the
young
gentleman
was
a
flirt
or
not
,
which
being
an
agreeable
conversation
of
a
light
kind
,
lasted
a
considerable
time
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
a
short
silence
occurring
,
the
young
ladies
on
either
side
of
the
young
gentleman
fell
suddenly
fast
asleep
;
and
the
young
gentleman
,
winking
upon
us
to
preserve
silence
,
won
a
pair
of
gloves
from
each
,
thereby
causing
them
to
wake
with
equal
suddenness
and
to
scream
very
loud
.
 
<EOS>
The
lively
conversation
to
which
this
pleasantry
gave
rise
,
lasted
for
the
remainder
of
the
ride
,
and
would
have
eked
out
a
much
longer
one
.
  
<EOS>
We
dined
rather
more
comfortably
than
people
usually
do
under
such
circumstances
,
nothing
having
been
left
behind
but
the
cork
-
screw
and
the
bread
.
 
<EOS>
The
married
gentlemen
were
unusually
thirsty
,
which
they
attributed
to
the
heat
of
the
weather
;
the
little
boys
ate
to
inconvenience
;
mammas
were
very
jovial
,
and
their
daughters
very
fascinating
;
and
the
attendants
being
well
-
behaved
men
,
got
exceedingly
drunk
at
a
respectful
distance
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
our
eye
on
Mr
Balim
at
dinner
-
time
,
and
perceived
that
he
flourished
wonderfully
,
being
still
surrounded
by
a
little
group
of
young
ladies
,
who
listened
to
him
as
an
oracle
,
while
he
ate
from
their
plates
and
drank
from
their
glasses
in
a
manner
truly
captivating
from
its
excessive
playfulness
.
 
<EOS>
His
conversation
,
too
,
was
exceedingly
brilliant
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
one
elderly
lady
assured
us
,
that
in
the
course
of
a
little
lively
BADINAGE
on
the
subject
of
ladies
'
dresses
,
he
had
evinced
as
much
knowledge
as
if
he
had
been
born
and
bred
a
milliner
.
  
<EOS>
As
such
of
the
fat
people
who
did
not
happen
to
fall
asleep
after
dinner
entered
upon
a
most
vigorous
game
at
ball
,
we
slipped
away
alone
into
a
thicker
part
of
the
wood
,
hoping
to
fall
in
with
Mr
Balim
,
the
greater
part
of
the
young
people
having
dropped
off
in
twos
and
threes
and
the
young
ladies
'
young
gentleman
among
them
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
we
disappointed
,
for
we
had
not
walked
far
,
when
,
peeping
through
the
trees
,
we
discovered
him
before
us
,
and
truly
it
was
a
pleasant
thing
to
contemplate
his
greatness
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
'
young
gentleman
was
seated
upon
the
ground
,
at
the
feet
of
a
few
young
ladies
who
were
reclining
on
a
bank
;
he
was
so
profusely
decked
with
scarfs
,
ribands
,
flowers
,
and
other
pretty
spoils
,
that
he
looked
like
a
lamb
---
or
<EOS>
perhaps
a
calf
would
be
a
better
simile
---
adorned
for
the
sacrifice
.
 
<EOS>
One
young
lady
supported
a
parasol
over
his
interesting
head
,
another
held
his
hat
,
and
a
third
<EOS>
his
neck
-
cloth
,
which
in
romantic
fashion
he
had
thrown
off
;
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
himself
,
with
his
hand
upon
his
breast
,
and
his
face
moulded
into
an
expression
of
the
most
honeyed
sweetness
,
was
warbling
forth
some
choice
specimens
of
vocal
music
in
praise
of
female
loveliness
,
in
a
style
so
exquisitely
perfect
,
that
we
burst
into
an
involuntary
shout
of
laughter
,
and
made
a
hasty
retreat
.
  
<EOS>
What
charming
fellows
<EOS>
these
young
ladies
'
young
gentlemen
are
!
<EOS>
Ducks
,
dears
,
loves
,
angels
,
are
all
terms
inadequate
to
express
their
merit
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
such
amazingly
,
uncommonly
,
wonderfully
,
nice
men
.
     
<EOS>
Conclusion
    
<EOS>
As
we
have
placed
before
the
young
ladies
so
many
specimens
of
young
gentlemen
,
and
have
also
in
the
dedication
of
this
volume
given
them
to
understand
how
much
we
reverence
and
admire
their
numerous
virtues
and
perfections
;
as
we
have
given
them
such
strong
reasons
to
treat
us
with
confidence
,
and
to
banish
<EOS>
,
in
our
case
,
all
that
reserve
and
distrust
of
the
male
sex
which
,
as
a
point
of
general
behaviour
,
they
can
not
do
better
than
preserve
and
maintain
---
we
say
,
as
we
have
done
all
this
,
we
feel
that
now
,
when
we
have
arrived
at
the
close
of
our
task
,
they
may
naturally
press
upon
us
the
inquiry
,
what
particular
description
of
young
gentlemen
we
can
conscientiously
recommend
.
  
<EOS>
Here
we
are
at
a
loss
.
 
<EOS>
We
look
over
our
list
,
and
can
neither
recommend
the
bashful
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
out
-
and
-
out
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
very
friendly
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
military
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
political
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
domestic
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
censorious
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
funny
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
poetical
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
young
ladies
'
young
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
As
there
are
some
good
points
about
many
of
them
,
which
still
are
not
sufficiently
numerous
to
render
any
one
among
them
eligible
,
as
a
whole
,
our
respectful
advice
to
the
young
ladies
is
,
to
seek
for
a
young
gentleman
who
unites
in
himself
the
best
qualities
of
all
,
and
the
worst
weaknesses
of
none
,
and
to
lead
him
forthwith
to
the
hymeneal
altar
,
whether
he
will
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
the
young
lady
who
secures
him
,
we
beg
to
tender
one
short
fragment
of
matrimonial
advice
,
selected
from
many
sound
passages
of
a
similar
tendency
,
to
be
found
in
a
letter
written
by
Dean
Swift
to
a
young
lady
on
her
marriage

<EOS>
"
The
grand
affair
of
your
life
will
be
,
to
gain
and
preserve
the
esteem
of
your
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
good
-
nature
nor
virtue
will
suffer
him
to
ESTEEM
you
against
his
judgment
;
and
although
he
is
not
capable
of
using
you
ill
,
yet
you
will
in
time
grow
a
thing
indifferent
and
perhaps
contemptible
;
unless
you
can
supply
the
loss
of
youth
and
beauty
with
more
durable
qualities
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
but
a
very
few
years
to
be
young
and
handsome
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
;
and
as
few
months
to
be
so
in
the
eyes
of
a
husband
who
is
not
a
fool
;
for
I
hope
you
do
not
still
dream
of
charms
and
raptures
,
which
marriage
ever
did
,
and
ever
will
,
put
a
sudden
end
to
.

"
  
<EOS>
From
the
anxiety
we
express
for
the
proper
behaviour
of
the
fortunate
lady
after
marriage
,
it
may
possibly
be
inferred
that
the
young
gentleman
to
whom
we
have
so
delicately
alluded
,
is
no
other
than
ourself
.
 
<EOS>
Without
in
any
way
committing
ourself
upon
this
point
,
we
have
merely
to
observe
,
that
we
are
ready
to
receive
sealed
offers
containing
a
full
specification
of
age
,
temper
,
appearance
,
and
condition
;
but
we
beg
it
to
be
distinctly
understood
that
we
do
not
pledge
ourself
to
accept
the
highest
bidder
.
  
<EOS>
These

may

,
in
so
making
known
Her
Most

intention
to
Her
Most
Honourable

as

"
It

my

ally
myself
in
marriage
with
Prince
Albert
of

Gotha

"
  
<EOS>
THAT
the
present
is
Bissextile
,
or
Leap
Year
,
in
which
it
is
held
and
considered
lawful
for
any
lady
to
offer
and
submit
proposals
of
marriage
to
any
gentleman
,
and
to
enforce
and
insist
upon
acceptance
of

THAT
these

other
the
horrors

dangers
with
which
the
said
<EOS>
Bissextile
,
or
Leap
Year
,
threatens
the
gentlemen
of
England
on
every
occasion
of
its
periodical
return
,
have
been
greatly
aggravated
and
augmented
by
the
terms
of
Her
Majesty
's
<EOS>
said
Most
Gracious
communication
,
which
have
filled
the
heads
of
divers
young
ladies
in
this
Realm
with
certain
new
ideas
destructive
to
the
peace
of
mankind
,
that
never
entered
their
imagination
before
.
  
<EOS>
THAT
a
case
has
occurred
in
Camberwell
,
in
which
a
young
lady
informed
her
Papa
that
"
she
intended
to
ally
herself
in
marriage
"
with
Mr
Smith
of
Stepney
;
and
that
another
,
and
a
very
distressing
case
,
has
occurred
at
Tottenham
,
in
which
a
young
lady
not
only
stated
her
intention
of
allying
herself
in
marriage
with
her
cousin
John
,
but
,
taking
violent
possession
of
her
<EOS>
said
cousin
<EOS>
,
actually
married
him
.
  
<EOS>
THAT
similar
outrages
are
of
constant
occurrence
,
not
only
in
the
capital
and
its
neighbourhood
,
but
throughout
the
kingdom
,
and
that
unless
the
excited
female
populace
be
speedily
checked
and
restrained
in
their
lawless
proceedings
,
most
deplorable
results
must
ensue
therefrom
;
among
which
may
be
anticipated
a
most
alarming
increase
in
the
population
of
the
country
,
with
which
no
efforts
of
the
agricultural
or
manufacturing
interest
can
possibly
keep
pace
.
  
<EOS>
THAT
there
is
strong
reason
to
suspect
the
existence
of
a
most
extensive
plot
,
conspiracy
,
or
design
,
secretly
contrived
by
vast
numbers
of
single
ladies
in
the
United
Kingdom
of
Great
Britain
and
Ireland
,
and
now
extending
its
ramifications
in
every
quarter
of
the
land
;
the
object
and
intent
of
which
plainly
appears
to
be
the
holding
and
solemnising
of
an
enormous
and
unprecedented
number
of
marriages
,
on
the
day
on
which
the
nuptials
of
Her
said
Most
Gracious
Majesty
are
performed
.
  
<EOS>
THAT
such
plot
,
conspiracy
,
or
design
,
strongly
savours
of
Popery
,
as
tending
to
the
discomfiture
of
the
Clergy
of
the
Established
Church
,
by
entailing
upon
them
great
mental
and
physical
exhaustion
;
and
that
such
Popish
plots
are
fomented
and
encouraged
by
Her
Majesty
's
Ministers
,
which
clearly
appears
---
not
only
from
Her
Majesty
's
principal
Secretary
of
State
for
Foreign
Affairs
traitorously
getting
married
while
holding
office
under
the
Crown
;
but
from
Mr
O'Connell
having
been
heard
to
declare
and
avow
that
,
if
he
had
a
daughter
to
marry
,
she
should
be
married
on
the
same
day
as
Her
said
Most
Gracious
Majesty
.
  
<EOS>
THAT
such
arch
plots
,
conspiracies
,
and
designs
,
besides
being
fraught
with
danger
to
the
Established
Church
,
and
(
consequently
)
to
the
State
,
can
not
fail
to
bring
ruin
and
bankruptcy
upon
a
large
class
of
Her
Majesty
's
subjects
;
as
a
great
and
sudden
increase
in
the
number
of
married
men
occasioning
the
comparative
desertion
(
for
a
time
)
of
Taverns
,
Hotels
,
Billiard
-
rooms
,
and
Gaming
-
Houses
,
will
deprive
the
Proprietors
of
their
accustomed
profits
and
returns
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
further
proof
of
the
depth
and
baseness
of
such
designs
,
it
may
be
here
observed
,
that
all
proprietors
of
Taverns
,
Hotels
,
Billiard
-
rooms
,
and
Gaming
-
Houses
,
are
(
especially
the
last
)
solemnly
devoted
to
the
Protestant
religion
.
  
<EOS>
FOR
all
these
reasons
,
and
many
others
of
no
less
gravity
and
import
,
an
urgent
appeal
is
made
to
the
gentlemen
of
England
(
being
bachelors
or
widowers
)
to
take
immediate
steps
for
convening
a
Public
meeting
;
To
consider
of
the
best
and
surest
means
of
averting
the
dangers
with
which
they
are
threatened
by
the
recurrence
of
Bissextile
,
or
Leap
Year
,
and
the
additional
sensation
created
among
single
ladies
by
the
terms
of
Her
Majesty
's
Most
Gracious
Declaration
;
To
take
measures
,
without
delay
,
for
resisting
the
said
single
Ladies
,
and
counteracting
their
evil
designs
;
And
to
pray
Her
Majesty
to
dismiss
her
present
Ministers
,
and
to
summon
to
her
Councils
those
distinguished
Gentlemen
in
various
Honourable
Professions
who
,
by
insulting
on
all
occasions
the
only
Lady
in
England
who
can
be
insulted
with
safety
,
have
given
a
sufficient
guarantee
to
Her
Majesty
's
Loving
Subjects
that
they
,
at
least
,
are
qualified
to
make
war
with
women
,
and
are
already
expert
in
the
use
of
those
weapons
which
are
common
to
the
lowest
and
most
abandoned
of
the
sex
.

There
is

this
morning
at

in

terrace

<EOS>
The
pastry

cook

people
have
been
there
half
-
a
-
dozen
times
already
;
all
day
yesterday
there
was
a
great
stir
and
bustle
,
and
they
were
up
this
morning
as
soon
as
it
was
light
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Emma
Fielding
is
going
to
be
married
to
young
Mr
Harvey
.
  
<EOS>
Heaven
alone
can
tell
in
what
bright
colours
this
marriage
is
painted
upon
the
mind
of
the
little
housemaid
at
number
six
,
who
has
hardly
slept
a
wink
all
night
with
thinking
of
it
,
and
now
stands
on
the
unswept
door
-
steps
leaning
upon
her
broom
,
and
looking
wistfully
towards
the
enchanted
house
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
short
of
omniscience
can
divine
what
visions
of
the
baker
,
or
the
green
-
grocer
,
or
the
smart
and
most
insinuating
butterman
,
are
flitting
across
her
mind
---
what
thoughts
of
how
she
would
dress
on
such
an
occasion
,
if
she
were
a
lady
---
of
how
she
would
dress
,
if
she
were
only
a
bride
---
of
how
cook
would
dress
,
being
bridesmaid
,
conjointly
with
her
sister
"
in
place
"
at
Fulham
,
and
how
the
clergyman
,
deeming
them
so
many
ladies
,
would
be
quite
humbled
and
respectful
.
 
<EOS>
What
day
-
dreams
of
hope
and
happiness
---
of
life
being
one
perpetual
holiday
,
with
no
master
and
no
mistress
to
grant
or
withhold
it
---
of
every
Sunday
being
a
Sunday
out
---
of
pure
freedom
as
to
curls
and
ringlets
,
and
no
obligation
to
hide
fine
heads
of
hair
in
caps
---
what
pictures
of
happiness
,
vast
and
immense
to
her
,
but
utterly
ridiculous
to
us
,
bewilder
the
brain
of
the
little
housemaid
at
number
six
,
all
called
into
existence
by
the
wedding
at
the
corner
!
  
<EOS>
We
smile
at
such
things
,
and
so
we
should
,
though
perhaps
for
a
better
reason
than
commonly
presents
itself
.
 
<EOS>
It
should
be
pleasant
to
us
to
know
that
there
are
notions
of
happiness
so
moderate
and
limited
,
since
upon
those
who
entertain
them
,
happiness
and
lightness
of
heart
are
very
easily
bestowed
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
little
housemaid
is
awakened
from
her
reverie
,
for
forth
from
the
door
of
the
magical
corner
house
<EOS>
there
runs
towards
her
,
all
fluttering
in
smart
new
dress
and
streaming
ribands
,
her
friend
Jane
Adams
,
who
comes
all
out
of
breath
to
redeem
a
solemn
promise
of
taking
her
in
,
under
cover
of
the
confusion
,
to
see
the
breakfast
table
spread
forth
in
state
,
and
---
sight
of
sights
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
her
young
mistress
ready
dressed
for
church
.
  
<EOS>
And
there
,
in
good
truth
,
when
they
have
stolen
up
-
stairs
on
tip
-
toe
and
edged
themselves
in
at
the
chamber
-
door
---
there
is
Miss
Emma
<EOS>
"
looking
like
the
sweetest
picter
,
"
in
a
white
chip
bonnet
and
orange
flowers
,
and
all
other
elegancies
becoming
a
bride
,
(
with
the
make
,
shape
,
and
quality
of
every
article
of
which
the
girl
is
perfectly
familiar
in
one
moment
,
and
never
forgets
to
her
dying
day
)
---
<EOS>
and
there
is
Miss
Emma
's
mamma
in
tears
,
and
Miss
Emma
's
papa
comforting
her
,
and
saying
how
that
of
course
she
has
been
long
looking
forward
to
this
,
and
how
happy
she
ought
to
be
---
and
there
too
is
<EOS>
Miss
Emma
's
sister
with
her
arms
round
her
neck
,
and
the
other
bridesmaid
all
smiles
and
tears
,
quieting
the
children
,
who
would
cry
more
but
that
they
are
so
finely
dressed
,
and
yet
sob
for
fear
sister
Emma
should
be
taken
away
---
and
it
is
all
so
affecting
,
that
the
two
servant
-
girls
cry
more
than
anybody
;
and
Jane
Adams
,
sitting
down
upon
the
stairs
,
when
they
have
crept
away
,
declares
that
her
legs
tremble
so
that
she
do
n't
know
what
to
do
,
and
that
she
will
say
for
Miss
Emma
,
that
she
never
had
a
hasty
word
from
her
,
and
that
she
does
hope
and
pray
she
may
be
happy
.
  
<EOS>
But
Jane
soon
comes
round
again
,
and
then
surely
there
never
was
anything
like
the
breakfast
table
,
glittering
with
plate
and
china
,
and
set
out
with
flowers
and
sweets
,
and
long
-
necked
bottles
,
in
the
most
sumptuous
and
dazzling
manner
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
centre
,
too
,
is
the
mighty
charm
,
the
cake
,
glistening
with
frosted
sugar
,
and
garnished
beautifully
.
 
<EOS>
They
agree
that
there
ought
to
be
a
little
Cupid
under
one
of
the
barley
-
sugar
temples
,
or
at
least
two
hearts
and
an
arrow
;
but
,
with
this
exception
,
there
is
nothing
to
wish
for
,
and
a
table
could
not
be
handsomer
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
arrive
at
this
conclusion
,
who
should
come
in
but
Mr
John
!
<EOS>
to
whom
Jane
says
that
its
only
Anne
from
number
six
;
and
John
says
HE
knows
,
for
he
's
often
winked
his
eye
down
the
area
,
which
causes
Anne
to
blush
and
look
confused
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
going
away
,
indeed
;
when
Mr
John
will
have
it
that
she
must
drink
a
glass
of
wine
,
and
he
says
never
mind
<EOS>
it
's
being
early
in
the
morning
<EOS>
,
it
wo
n't
hurt
her
:
 
<EOS>
so
they
shut
the
door
and
pour
out
the
wine
;
and
Anne
drinking
lane
's
health
,
and
adding
,
"
<EOS>
and
here
's
wishing
you
yours
,
Mr
John
,
"
drinks
it
in
a
great
many
sips
,
---
<EOS>
Mr
John
all
the
time
making
jokes
appropriate
to
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
Mr
John
,
who
has
waxed
bolder
by
degrees
,
pleads
the
usage
at
weddings
,
and
claims
the
privilege
of
a
kiss
,
which
he
obtains
after
a
great
scuffle
;
and
footsteps
being
now
heard
on
the
stairs
,
they
disperse
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
a
carriage
has
driven
up
to
convey
the
bride
to
church
,
and
Anne
of
number
six
prolonging
the
process
of
"
cleaning
her
door
,
"
has
the
satisfaction
of
beholding
the
bride
and
bridesmaids
,
and
the
papa
and
mamma
,
hurry
into
the
same
and
drive
rapidly
off
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
is
this
all
,
for
soon
other
carriages
begin
to
arrive
with
a
posse
of
company
all
beautifully
dressed
,
at
whom
she
could
stand
and
gaze
for
ever
;
but
having
something
else
to
do
,
is
compelled
to
take
one
last
long
look
and
shut
the
street
-
door
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
the
company
have
gone
down
to
breakfast
,
and
tears
have
given
place
to
smiles
,
for
all
the
corks
are
out
of
the
long
-
necked
bottles
,
and
their
contents
are
disappearing
rapidly
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Emma
's
papa
is
at
the
top
of
the
table
;
Miss
Emma
's
mamma
at
the
bottom
;
and
beside
the
latter
are
Miss
Emma
herself
and
her
husband
,
---
<EOS>
admitted
on
all
hands
to
be
the
handsomest
and
most
interesting
young
couple
ever
known
.
 
<EOS>
All
down
both
sides
of
the
table
,
too
,
are
various
young
ladies
,
beautiful
to
see
,
and
various
young
gentlemen
who
seem
to
think
so
;
and
there
,
in
a
post
of
honour
,
is
an
unmarried
aunt
of
Miss
Emma
's
,
reported
to
possess
unheard
-
of
riches
,
and
to
have
expressed
vast
testamentary
intentions
respecting
her
favourite
niece
and
new
nephew
.
 
<EOS>
This
lady
has
been
very
liberal
and
generous
already
,
as
the
jewels
worn
by
the
bride
abundantly
testify
,
but
that
is
nothing
to
what
she
means
to
do
,
or
even
to
what
she
has
done
,
for
she
put
herself
in
close
communication
with
the
dressmaker
three
months
ago
,
and
prepared
a
wardrobe
(
with
some
articles
worked
by
her
own
hands
)
fit
for
a
Princess
.
 
<EOS>
People
may
call
her
an
old
maid
,
and
so
she
may
be
,
but
she
is
neither
cross
nor
ugly
for
all
that
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
is
very
cheerful
and
pleasant
-
looking
,
and
very
kind
and
tender
-
hearted
:
 
which
is
no
matter
of
surprise
except
to
those
who
yield
to
popular
prejudices
without
thinking
why
,
and
will
never
grow
wiser
and
never
know
better
.
  
<EOS>
Of
all
the
company
though
,
none
are
more
pleasant
to
behold
or
better
pleased
with
themselves
than
two
young
children
,
who
,
in
honour
of
the
day
,
have
seats
among
the
guests
.
 
<EOS>
Of
these
,
one
is
a
little
fellow
of
six
or
eight
years
old
,
brother
to
the
bride
,
---
and
the
other
a
girl
of
the
same
age
,
or
something
younger
,
whom
he
calls
"
his
wife
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
real
bride
and
bridegroom
are
not
more
devoted
than
they
:
 
he
all
love
and
attention
,
and
she
all
blushes
and
fondness
,
toying
with
a
little
bouquet
which
he
gave
her
this
morning
,
and
placing
the
scattered
rose
-
leaves
in
her
bosom
with
nature
's
own
coquettishness
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
dreamt
of
each
other
in
their
quiet
dreams
,
these
children
,
and
their
little
hearts
have
been
nearly
broken
when
the
absent
one
has
been
dispraised
in
jest
.
<EOS>
When
will
there
come
in
after
-
life
a
passion
so
earnest
,
generous
,
and
true
as
theirs
;
what
,
even
in
its
gentlest
realities
,
can
have
the
grace
and
charm
that
hover
round
such
fairy
lovers
!
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
merriment
and
happiness
of
the
feast
have
gained
their
height
;
certain
ominous
looks
begin
to
be
exchanged
between
the
bridesmaids
,
and
somehow
it
gets
whispered
about
that
the
carriage
which
is
to
take
the
young
couple
into
the
country
has
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
Such
members
of
the
party
as
are
most
disposed
to
prolong
its
enjoyments
,
affect
to
consider
this
a
false
alarm
,
but
it
turns
out
too
true
,
being
speedily
confirmed
,
first
by
the
retirement
of
the
bride
and
a
select
file
of
intimates
who
are
to
prepare
her
for
the
journey
,
and
secondly
by
the
withdrawal
of
the
ladies
generally
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
there
ensues
a
particularly
awkward
pause
,
in
which
everybody
essays
to
be
facetious
,
and
nobody
succeeds
;
at
length
the
bridegroom
makes
a
mysterious
disappearance
in
obedience
to
some
equally
mysterious
signal
;
and
the
table
is
deserted
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
for
at
least
six
weeks
last
past
it
has
been
solemnly
devised
and
settled
that
the
young
couple
should
go
away
in
secret
;
but
they
no
sooner
appear
without
the
door
than
the
drawing
-
room
windows
are
blocked
up
with
ladies
waving
their
handkerchiefs
and
kissing
their
hands
,
and
the
dining
-
room
panes
with
gentlemen
's
faces
beaming
farewell
in
every
queer
variety
of
its
expression
.
<EOS>
The
hall
and
steps
are
crowded
with
servants
in
white
favours
,
mixed
up
with
particular
friends
and
relations
who
have
darted
out
to
say
good
-
bye
;
and
foremost
in
the
group
are
<EOS>
the
tiny
lovers
arm
in
arm
,
thinking
,
<EOS>
with
fluttering
hearts
,
what
happiness
it
would
be
to
dash
away
together
in
that
gallant
coach
,
and
never
part
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
bride
has
barely
time
for
one
hurried
glance
at
her
old
home
,
when
the
steps
rattle
,
the
door
slams
,
the
horses
clatter
on
the
pavement
,
and
they
have
left
it
far
away
.
  
<EOS>
A
knot
of
women
servants
still
remain
clustered
in
the
hall
,
whispering
among
themselves
,
and
there
of
course
is
Anne
from
number
six
,
who
has
made
another
escape
on
some
plea
or
other
,
and
been
an
admiring
witness
of
the
departure
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
two
points
on
which
Anne
expatiates
over
and
over
again
,
without
the
smallest
appearance
of
fatigue
or
intending
to
leave
off
;
one
is
,
that
she
"
never
see
in
all
her
life
<EOS>
such
a
---
oh
such
a
angel
of
a
gentleman
as
Mr
Harvey
"
---
and
the
other
,
that
she
"
ca
n't
tell
how
it
is
,
but
it
do
n't
seem
a
bit
like
a
work
-
a
-
day
,
or
a
Sunday
<EOS>
neither
<EOS>
---
it
's
all
so
unsettled
and
unregular
.

<EOS>
The
Formal
Couple
    
<EOS>
The
formal
couple
are
the
most
prim
,
cold
,
immovable
,
and
unsatisfactory
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
Their
faces
,
voices
,
dress
,
house
,
furniture
,
walk
,
and
manner
,
are
all
the
essence
of
formality
,
unrelieved
by
one
redeeming
touch
of
frankness
,
heartiness
,
or
nature
.
  
<EOS>
Everything
with
the
formal
couple
resolves
itself
into
a
matter
of
form
.
 
<EOS>
They
do
n't
call
upon
you
on
your
account
,
but
<EOS>
their
own
;
not
to
see
how
you
are
,
but
to
show
how
they
are
:
 
<EOS>
it
is
not
a
ceremony
to
do
honour
to
you
,
but
to
themselves
,
---
not
due
to
your
position
,
but
to
theirs
.
 
<EOS>
If
one
of
a
friend
's
children
die
,
the
formal
couple
are
as
sure
and
punctual
in
sending
to
the
house
as
the
undertaker
;
if
a
friend
's
family
be
increased
,
the
monthly
nurse
is
not
more
attentive
than
they
.
 
<EOS>
The
formal
couple
,
in
fact
,
joyfully
seize
all
occasions
of
testifying
their
good
-
breeding
and
precise
observance
of
the
little
usages
of
society
;
and
for
you
,
who
are
the
means
to
this
end
,
they
care
as
much
as
a
man
does
for
the
tailor
who
has
enabled
him
to
cut
a
figure
,
or
a
woman
for
the
milliner
who
has
assisted
her
to
a
conquest
.
  
<EOS>
Having
an
extensive
connexion
among
that
kind
of
people
who
make
acquaintances
and
eschew
friends
,
the
formal
gentleman
attends
from
time
to
time
<EOS>
a
great
many
funerals
,
to
which
he
is
formally
invited
,
and
to
which
he
formally
goes
,
as
returning
a
call
for
the
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
Here
his
deportment
is
of
the
most
faultless
description
;
he
knows
the
exact
pitch
of
voice
it
is
proper
to
assume
,
the
sombre
look
he
ought
to
wear
,
the
melancholy
tread
which
should
be
his
gait
for
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
perfectly
acquainted
with
all
the
dreary
courtesies
to
be
observed
in
a
mourning
-
coach
;
knows
when
to
sigh
,
and
when
to
hide
his
nose
in
the
white
handkerchief
;
and
looks
into
the
grave
and
shakes
his
head
when
the
ceremony
is
concluded
,
with
the
sad
formality
of
a
mute
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
kind
of
funeral
was
it
?
"
says
the
formal
lady
,
when
he
returns
home
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
replies
the
formal
gentleman
,
"
there
never
was
such
a
gross
and
disgusting
impropriety
;
there
were
no
feathers
.
"
<EOS>
"
No
feathers
!
"
<EOS>
cries
the
lady
,
as
if
on
wings
of
black
feathers
dead
people
fly
to
Heaven
,
and
,
lacking
them
<EOS>
,
they
must
of
necessity
go
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
Her
husband
shakes
his
head
;
and
further
adds
,
that
they
had
seed
-
cake
instead
of
plum
-
cake
,
and
that
it
was
all
white
wine
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
white
wine
!
<EOS>
"
exclaims
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
but
sherry
and
madeira
,
"
says
the
husband
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
no
port
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
drop
.
"
 
<EOS>
No
port
,
no
plums
,
and
no
feathers
!
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
recollect
,
my
dear
,
"
says
the
formal
lady
,
in
a
voice
of
stately
reproof
,
"
that
when
we
first
met
this
poor
man
who
is
now
dead
and
gone
,
and
he
took
that
very
strange
course
of
addressing
me
at
dinner
without
being
previously
introduced
,
I
ventured
to
express
my
opinion
that
the
family
were
quite
ignorant
of
etiquette
,
and
very
imperfectly
acquainted
with
the
decencies
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
now
had
a
good
opportunity
of
judging
for
yourself
,
and
all
I
have
to
say
is
,
that
I
trust
you
will
never
go
to
a
funeral
THERE
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
replies
the
formal
gentleman
,
"
I
never
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
the
informal
deceased
is
cut
in
his
grave
;
and
the
formal
couple
,
when
they
tell
the
story
of
the
funeral
,
shake
their
heads
,
and
wonder
what
some
people
's
feelings
ARE
made
of
,
and
what
their
notions
of
propriety
CAN
be
!
  
<EOS>
If
the
formal
couple
have
a
family
(
which
they
sometimes
have
)
,
they
are
not
children
,
but
little
,
pale
,
sour
,
sharp
-
nosed
men
and
women
;
and
so
exquisitely
brought
up
,
that
they
might
be
very
old
dwarfs
for
anything
that
appeareth
to
the
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
they
are
so
acquainted
with
forms
and
conventionalities
,
and
conduct
themselves
with
such
strict
decorum
,
that
to
see
the
little
girl
break
a
looking
-
glass
in
some
wild
outbreak
,
or
the
little
boy
kick
his
parents
,
would
be
to
any
visitor
an
unspeakable
relief
and
consolation
.
  
<EOS>
The
formal
couple
are
always
sticklers
for
what
is
rigidly
proper
,
and
have
a
great
readiness
in
detecting
hidden
impropriety
of
speech
or
thought
,
which
by
less
scrupulous
people
would
be
wholly
unsuspected
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
if
they
pay
a
visit
to
the
theatre
,
they
sit
all
night
in
a
perfect
agony
lest
anything
improper
or
immoral
should
proceed
from
the
stage
;
and
if
anything
should
happen
to
be
said
which
admits
of
a
double
construction
,
they
never
fail
to
take
it
up
directly
,
and
to
express
by
their
looks
the
great
outrage
which
their
feelings
have
sustained
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
this
is
their
chief
reason
for
absenting
themselves
almost
entirely
from
places
of
public
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
They
go
sometimes
to
the
Exhibition
of
the
Royal
Academy
;
---
but
that
is
often
more
shocking
than
the
stage
itself
,
and
the
formal
lady
thinks
that
it
really
is
high
time
<EOS>
Mr
Etty
was
prosecuted
and
made
a
public
example
of
.
  
<EOS>
We
made
one
at
a
christening
party
not
long
since
,
where
there
were
amongst
the
guests
a
formal
couple
,
who
suffered
the
acutest
torture
from
certain
jokes
,
incidental
to
such
an
occasion
,
cut
---
and
very
likely
dried
also
---
by
one
of
the
godfathers
;
<EOS>
a
red
-
faced
elderly
gentleman
,
who
,
being
highly
popular
with
the
rest
of
the
company
,
had
it
all
his
own
way
,
and
was
in
great
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
at
supper
-
time
that
this
gentleman
came
out
in
full
force
.
 
<EOS>
We
---
being
of
a
grave
and
quiet
demeanour
---
had
been
chosen
to
escort
the
formal
lady
down
-
stairs
,
and
,
sitting
beside
her
,
had
a
favourable
opportunity
of
observing
her
emotions
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
,
in
the
very
beginning
,
and
in
the
first
blush
---
literally
the
first
blush
---
of
the
matter
,
the
formal
lady
had
not
felt
quite
certain
whether
the
being
present
at
such
a
ceremony
,
and
encouraging
,
as
it
were
,
the
public
exhibition
of
a
baby
,
was
not
an
act
involving
some
degree
of
indelicacy
and
impropriety
;
but
certain
we
are
that
when
that
baby
's
health
was
drunk
,
and
allusions
were
made
,
by
a
grey
-
headed
gentleman
proposing
it
,
to
the
time
when
he
had
dandled
in
his
arms
the
young
Christian
's
mother
,
---
<EOS>
certain
we
are
that
then
the
formal
lady
took
the
alarm
,
and
recoiled
from
the
old
gentleman
as
from
a
hoary
profligate
.
 
<EOS>
Still
she
bore
it
;
she
fanned
herself
with
an
indignant
air
,
but
still
she
bore
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
comic
song
was
sung
,
involving
a
confession
from
some
imaginary
gentleman
that
he
had
kissed
a
female
,
and
yet
the
formal
lady
bore
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
at
last
,
the
health
of
the
godfather
before
-
mentioned
being
drunk
,
the
godfather
rose
to
return
thanks
,
and
in
the
course
of
his
observations
darkly
hinted
at
babies
yet
unborn
,
and
even
contemplated
the
possibility
of
the
subject
of
that
festival
having
brothers
and
sisters
,
the
formal
lady
could
endure
no
more
,
but
,
bowing
slightly
round
,
and
sweeping
haughtily
past
the
offender
,
left
the
room
in
tears
,
under
the
protection
of
the
formal
gentleman
.
    
<EOS>
The
Loving
Couple
    
<EOS>
There
can
not
be
a
better
practical
illustration
of
the
wise
saw
and
ancient
instance
,
that
there
may
be
too
much
of
a
good
thing
,
than
is
presented
by
a
loving
couple
.
 
<EOS>
Undoubtedly
it
is
meet
and
proper
that
two
persons
joined
together
in
holy
matrimony
should
be
loving
,
and
unquestionably
it
is
pleasant
to
know
and
see
that
they
are
so
;
but
there
is
a
time
for
all
things
,
and
the
couple
who
happen
to
be
always
in
a
loving
state
before
company
,
are
well
-
nigh
intolerable
.
  
<EOS>
And
in
taking
up
this
position
we
would
have
it
distinctly
understood
that
we
do
not
seek
alone
the
sympathy
of
bachelors
,
in
whose
objection
to
loving
couples
we
recognise
interested
motives
and
personal
considerations
.
 
<EOS>
We
grant
that
to
that
unfortunate
class
of
society
there
may
be
something
very
irritating
,
tantalising
,
and
provoking
,
in
being
compelled
to
witness
those
gentle
endearments
and
chaste
interchanges
which
to
loving
couples
are
quite
the
ordinary
business
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
But
while
we
recognise
the
natural
character
of
the
prejudice
to
which
these
unhappy
men
are
subject
,
we
can
neither

their

<EOS>
Dispassionate
experience
is
our
only
guide
;
and
in
these
moral
essays
we
seek
no
less
to
reform
hymeneal
offenders
than
to
hold
out
a
timely
warning
to
all
rising
couples
,
and
even
to
those
who
have
not
yet
set
forth
upon
their
pilgrimage
towards
the
matrimonial
market
.
  
<EOS>
Let
all
couples
,
present
or
to
come
,
therefore
profit
by
the
example
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Leaver
,
themselves
a
loving
couple
in
the
first
degree
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Leaver
are
pronounced
by
Mrs
Starling
,
a
widow
lady
who
lost
her
husband
when
she
was
young
,
and
lost
herself
about
the
same
-
time
---
for
by
her
own
count
she
has
never
since
grown
five
years
older
---
to
be
a
perfect
model
of
wedded
felicity
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
suppose
,
"
says
the
romantic
lady
,
"
that
they
were
lovers
only
just
now
engaged
.
 
<EOS>
Never
was
such
happiness
!
 
<EOS>
They
are
so
tender
,
so
affectionate
,
so
attached
to
each
other
,
so
enamoured
,
that
positively
nothing
can
be
more
charming
!

Augusta

says
Mr
Leaver
.
 
<EOS>
"
Augustus
,
my
life
,
"
replies
Mrs
Leaver
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sing
some
little
ballad
,
darling
,
"
quoth
Mr
Leaver
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
,
indeed
,
dearest
,
"
returns
Mrs
Leaver
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
,
my
dove
,
"
says
Mr
Leaver
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
possibly
,
my
love
,
"
replies
Mrs
Leaver
;
"
and
it
's
very
naughty
of
you
to
ask
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Naughty
,
darling
!
<EOS>
"
cries
Mr
Leaver
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
very
naughty
,
and
very
cruel
,
"
returns
Mrs
Leaver
,
"
<EOS>
for
you
know
I
have
a
sore
throat
,
and
that
to
sing
would
give
me
great
pain
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
monster
,
and
I
hate
you
.
 
<EOS>
Go
away
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Leaver
has
said
"
go
away
,
"
because
Mr
Leaver
has
tapped
her
under
the
chin
:
 
<EOS>
Mr
Leaver
not
doing
as
he
is
bid
,
but
on
the
contrary
,
sitting
down
beside
her
<EOS>
,
Mrs
Leaver
slaps
Mr
Leaver
;
and
Mr
Leaver
in
return
slaps
Mrs
Leaver
,
and
it
being
now
time
for
all
persons
present
to
look
the
other
way
,
they
look
the
other
way
,
and
hear
a
still
small
sound
as
of
kissing
,
at
which
Mrs
Starling
is
thoroughly
enraptured
,
and
whispers
her
neighbour
that
if
all
married
couples
were
like
that
,
what
a
heaven
this
earth
would
be
!
  
<EOS>
The
loving
couple
are
at
home
when
this
occurs
,
and
maybe
only
three
or
four
friends
are
present
,
but
,
unaccustomed
to
reserve
upon
this
interesting
point
,
they
are
pretty
much
the
same
abroad
.
<EOS>
Indeed
upon
some
occasions
,
such
as
a
pic
-
nic
or
a
water
-
party
,
their
lovingness
is
even
more
developed
,
as
we
had
an
opportunity
last
summer
of
observing
in
person
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
water
-
party
made
up
to
go
to
Twickenham
and
dine
,
and
afterwards
dance
in
an
empty
villa
by
the
river
-
side
,
hired
expressly
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Leaver
were
of
the
company
;
and
it
was
our
fortune
to
have
a
seat
in
the
same
boat
,
which
was
an
eight
-
oared
galley
,
manned
by
amateurs
,
with
a
blue
striped
awning
of
the
same
pattern
as
their
Guernsey
shirts
,
and
a
dingy
red
flag
of
the
same
shade
as
the
whiskers
of
the
stroke
oar
.
<EOS>
A
coxswain
being
appointed
,
and
all
other
matters
adjusted
,
the
eight
gentlemen
threw
themselves
into
strong
paroxysms
,
and
pulled
up
with
the
tide
,
stimulated
by
the
compassionate
remarks
of
the
ladies
,
who
one
and
all
exclaimed
,
that
it
seemed
an
immense
exertion
---
as
indeed
it
did
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
we
raced
the
other
boat
,
which
came
alongside
in
gallant
style
;
but
this
being
found
an
unpleasant
amusement
,
as
giving
rise
to
a
great
quantity
of
splashing
,
and
rendering
the
cold
pies
and
other
viands
very
moist
,
it
was
unanimously
voted
down
,
and
we
were
suffered
to
shoot
a
-
head
,
while
the
second
boat
followed
ingloriously
in
our
wake
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
at
this
time
that
we
first
recognised
Mr
Leaver
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
two
firemen
-
watermen
in
the
boat
,
lying
by
until
somebody
was
exhausted
;
and
one
of
them
,
who
had
taken
upon
himself
the
direction
of
affairs
,
was
heard
to
cry
in
a
gruff
voice
,
"
Pull
away
,
number
two
---
give
it
her
<EOS>
,
number
two
---
take
a
longer
reach
,
number
two
---
now
,
number
two
,
sir
,
think
you
're
winning
a
boat
.
<EOS>
"
The
greater
part
of
the
company
had
no
doubt
begun
to
wonder
which
of
the
striped
Guernseys
it
might
be
that
stood
in
need
of
such
encouragement
,
when
a
stifled
shriek
from
Mrs
Leaver
confirmed
the
doubtful
and
informed
the
ignorant
;
and
Mr
Leaver
,
still
further
disguised
in
a
straw
hat
and
no
neckcloth
,
was
observed
to
be
in
a
fearful
perspiration
,
and
failing
visibly
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
the
general
consternation
diminished
at
this
instant
by
the
same
gentleman
(
in
the
performance
of
an
accidental
aquatic
feat
,
termed
"
catching
a
crab
'
)
<EOS>
plunging
suddenly
backward
,
and
displaying
nothing
of
himself
to
the
company
,
but
two
violently
struggling
legs
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Leaver
shrieked
again
several
times
,
and
cried
piteously
---
"
Is
he
dead
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
the
worst
.
 
<EOS>
Is
he
dead
?
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
a
moment
's
reflection
might
have
convinced
the
loving
wife
,
that
unless
her
husband
were
endowed
with
some
most
surprising
powers
of
muscular
action
,
he
never
could
be
dead
while
he
kicked
so
hard
;
but
still
Mrs
Leaver
cried
,
"
Is
he
dead
?
<EOS>
is
he
dead
?
"
<EOS>
and
still
everybody
else
cried
---
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
until
such
time
as
Mr
Leaver
was
replaced
in
a
sitting
posture
,
and
his
oar
(
which
had
been
going
through
all
kinds
of
wrong
-
headed
performances
on
its
own
account
)
was
once
more
put
in
his
hand
,
by
the
exertions
of
the
two
firemen
-
watermen
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Leaver
then
exclaimed
,
"
Augustus
,
my
child
,
come
to
me
;
"
and
Mr
Leaver
said
,
"
Augusta
,
my
love
,
compose
yourself
,
I
am
not
injured
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Leaver
cried
again
more
piteously
than
before
,
"
Augustus
,
my
child
,
come
to
me
;
"
and
now
the
company
generally
,
who
seemed
to
be
apprehensive
that
if
Mr
Leaver
remained
where
he
was
,
he
might
contribute
more
than
his
proper
share
towards
the
drowning
of
the
party
,
disinterestedly
took
part
with
Mrs
Leaver
,
and
said
he
really
ought
to
go
,
and
that
he
was
not
strong
enough
for
such
violent
exercise
,
and
ought
never
to
have
undertaken
it
.
 
<EOS>
Reluctantly
,
Mr
Leaver
went
,
and
laid
himself
down
at
Mrs
Leaver
's
feet
,
and
Mrs
Leaver
stooping
over
him
,
said
,
"
Oh
Augustus
,
how
could
you
terrify
me
so
?
"
<EOS>
and
Mr
Leaver
said
,
"
Augusta
,
my
sweet
<EOS>
,
I
never
meant
to
terrify
you
;
"
and
Mrs
Leaver
said
,
"
You
are
faint
,
my
dear
;
"
and
Mr
Leaver
said
,
"
I
am
rather
so
,
my
love
;
"
and
they
were
very
loving
indeed
under
Mrs
Leaver
's
veil
,
until
at
length
<EOS>
Mr
Leaver
came
forth
again
,
and
pleasantly
asked
if
he
had
not
heard
something
said
about
bottled
stout
and
sandwiches
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Starling
,
who
was
one
of
the
party
,
was
perfectly
delighted
with
this
scene
,
and
frequently
murmured
half
-
aside
,
"
What
a
loving
couple
you
are
!
"
<EOS>
or
"
How
delightful
it
is
to
see
man
and
wife
so
happy
together
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
To
us
she
was
quite
poetical
,
(
for
we
are
a
kind
of
cousins
,
)
observing
that
hearts
beating
in
unison
like
that
made
life
a
paradise
of
sweets
;
and
that
when
kindred
creatures
were
drawn
together
by
sympathies
so
fine
and
delicate
,
what
more
than
mortal
happiness
did
not
our
souls
partake
!
 
<EOS>
To
all
this
we
answered
"
Certainly
,
"
or
"
Very
true
,
"
or
merely
sighed
,
as
the
case
might
be
.
 
<EOS>
At
every
new
act
of
the
loving
couple
,
the
widow
's
admiration
broke
out
afresh
;
and
when
Mrs
Leaver
would
not
permit
Mr
Leaver
to
keep
his
hat
off
,
lest
the
sun
should
strike
to
his
head
,
and
give
him
a
brain
fever
,
Mrs
Starling
actually
shed
tears
,
and
said
it
reminded
her
of
Adam
and
Eve
.
  
<EOS>
The
loving
couple
were
thus
loving
all
the
way
to
Twickenham
,
but
when
we
arrived
there
(
by
which
time
the
amateur
crew
looked
very
thirsty
and
vicious
)
<EOS>
they
were
more
playful
than
ever
,
for
Mrs
Leaver
threw
stones
at
Mr
Leaver
,
and
Mr
Leaver
ran
after
Mrs
Leaver
on
the
grass
,
in
a
most
innocent
and
enchanting
manner
.
 
<EOS>
At
dinner
,
too
,
Mr
Leaver
WOULD
steal
Mrs
Leaver
's
tongue
,
and
Mrs
Leaver
WOULD
retaliate
upon
Mr
Leaver
's
fowl
;
and
when
Mrs
Leaver
was
going
to
take
some
lobster
salad
,
Mr
Leaver
would
n't
let
her
have
any
,
saying
that
it
made
her
ill
,
and
she
was
always
sorry
for
it
afterwards
,
which
afforded
Mrs
Leaver
an
opportunity
of
pretending
to
be
cross
,
and
showing
many
other
prettinesses
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
was
merely
the
smiling
surface
of
their
loves
,
not
the
mighty
depths
of
the
stream
,
down
to
which
the
company
,
to
say
the
truth
,
dived
rather
unexpectedly
,
from
the
following
accident
.
 
<EOS>
It
chanced
that
Mr
Leaver
took
upon
himself
to
propose
the
bachelors
who
had
first
originated
the
notion
of
that
entertainment
,
in
doing
which
,
he
affected
to
regret
that
he
was
no
longer
of
their
body
himself
,
and
pretended
grievously
to
lament
his
fallen
state
.
 
<EOS>
This
Mrs
Leaver
's
feelings
could
not
brook
,
even
in
jest
,
and
consequently
,
exclaiming
aloud
,
"
He
loves
me
not
,
he
loves
me
not
!
"
<EOS>
she
fell
in
a
very
pitiable
state
into
the
arms
of
Mrs
Starling
,
and
,
directly
becoming
insensible
,
was
conveyed
by
that
lady
and
her
husband
into
another
room
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
Mr
Leaver
came
running
back
to
know
if
there
was
a
medical
gentleman
in
company
,
and
as
there
was
,
(
in
what
company
is
there
not
?
)
<EOS>
both
Mr
Leaver
and
the
medical
gentleman
hurried
away
together
.
  
<EOS>
The
medical
gentleman
was
the
first
who
returned
,
and
among
his
intimate
friends
he
was
observed
to
laugh
and
wink
,
and
look
as
unmedical
as
might
be
;
but
when
Mr
Leaver
came
back
he
was
very
solemn
,
and
in
answer
to
all
inquiries
,
shook
his
head
,
and
remarked
that
Augusta
was
far
too
sensitive
to
be
trifled
with
---
an
opinion
which
the
widow
subsequently
confirmed
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
that
she
was
in
no
imminent
peril
,
however
,
the
rest
of
the
party
betook
themselves
to
dancing
on
the
green
,
and
very
merry
and
happy
they
were
,
and
a
vast
quantity
of
flirtation
<EOS>
there
was
;
<EOS>
the
last
circumstance
being
no
doubt
attributable
,
partly
to
the
fineness
of
the
weather
,
and
partly
to
the
locality
,
which
is
well
known
to
be
favourable
to
all
harmless
recreations
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
bustle
of
the
scene
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Leaver
stole
down
to
the
boat
,
and
disposed
themselves
under
the
awning
,
Mrs
Leaver
reclining
her
head
upon
Mr
Leaver
's
shoulder
,
and
Mr
Leaver
grasping
her
hand
with
great
fervour
,
and
looking
in
her
face
from
time
to
time
with
a
melancholy
and
sympathetic
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
The
widow
sat
apart
,
feigning
to
be
occupied
with
a
book
,
but
stealthily
observing
them
from
behind
her
fan
;
and
the
two
firemen
-
watermen
,
smoking
their
pipes
on
the
bank
hard
by
,
nudged
each
other
,
and
grinned
in
enjoyment
of
the
joke
.
 
<EOS>
Very
few
of
the
party
missed
the
loving
couple
;
and
the
few
who
did
,
heartily
congratulated
each
other
on
their
disappearance
.
    
<EOS>
The
Contradictory
Couple
    
One
would
suppose
that
two
people
who
are
to
pass
their
whole
lives
together
,
and
must
necessarily
be
very
often
alone
with
each
other
,
could
find
little
pleasure
in
mutual
contradiction
;
and
yet
what
is
more
common
than
a
contradictory
couple
?
  
<EOS>
The
contradictory
couple
agree
in
nothing
but
contradiction
.
 
<EOS>
They
return
home
from
Mrs
Bluebottle
's
dinner
-
party
,
each
in
an
opposite
corner
of
the
coach
,
and
do
not
exchange
a
syllable
until
they
have
been
seated
for
at
least
twenty
minutes
by
the
fireside
at
home
,
when
the
gentleman
,
raising
his
eyes
from
the
stove
,
all
at
once
breaks
silence
:
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
very
extraordinary
thing
it
is
,
"
says
he
,
"
that
you
WILL
contradict
,
Charlotte
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
contradict
!
"
<EOS>
cries
the
lady
,
"
but
that
's
just
like
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
like
me
?
"
says
the
gentleman
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Saying
that
I
contradict
you
,
"
replies
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
do
NOT
contradict
me
?
"
<EOS>
retorts
the
gentleman
;
"
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
not
been
contradicting
me
the
whole
of
this
day
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
now
,
that
you
have
not
?
 
<EOS>
I
mean
to
tell
you
nothing
of
the
kind
,
"
replies
the
lady
quietly
;
"
when
you
are
wrong
,
of
course
I
shall
contradict
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
During
this
dialogue
the
gentleman
has
been
taking
his
brandy
-
and
-
water
on
one
side
of
the
fire
,
and
the
lady
,
with
her
dressing
-
case
on
the
table
,
has
been
curling
her
hair
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
She
now
lets
down
her
back
hair
,
and
proceeds
to
brush
it
;
preserving
at
the
same
time
an
air
of
conscious
rectitude
and
suffering
virtue
,
which
is
intended
to
exasperate
the
gentleman
---
and
does
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
believe

"
he
says
,
taking
the
spoon
out
of
his
glass
,
and
tossing
it
on
the
table
,
"
that
of
all
the
obstinate

positive

wrong

headed
creatures

were
ever
born

you
are

Certainly

have
it
your

You
see
how
much
I
contradict
you

"
rejoins
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course

you
did
n't
contradict
me
at
dinner

time

oh
no

not
you

says
the
gentleman

<EOS>
"
Yes

I
did

says
the

.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh

you
did

"
cries
the
gentleman
<EOS>
"
you
admit
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
call
that
contradiction
,
I
do

the
lady
answers
;
"
and
I
say
again
,
Edward

that
when
I
know
you
are
wrong

I
will
contradict
you

<EOS>
I
am
not
your
slave

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
my
slave
!
<EOS>
"
repeats
the
gentleman
bitterly
;
"
and
you
still
mean
to
say
that
in
the
Blackburns
'
new
house
there
are
not
more
than
fourteen
doors
,
including
the
door
of
the
wine
-
cellar

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
say
,
"
retorts
the
lady
,
beating
time
with
her
hair
-
brush
on
the
palm
of
her
hand
,
"
that
in
that
house
there
are
fourteen
doors
and
no
more

"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
then
---
"
cries
the
gentleman
,
rising
in
despair
,
and
pacing
the
room
with
rapid
strides
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
G
---
,
this
is
enough
to
destroy
a
man
's
intellect
,
and
drive
him
mad
!
"
  
<EOS>
By
and
by
the
gentleman
comes
-
to
a
little
,
and
passing
his
hand
gloomily
across
his
forehead
,
reseats
himself
in
his
former
chair
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
long
silence
,
and
this
time
the
lady
begins
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
appealed
to
Mr
Jenkins
,
who
sat
next
to
me
on
the
sofa
in
the
drawing
-
room
during
tea
---

"
Morgan

you

interrupts
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
anything
of

answers
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
by
all
that
is
aggravating
and
impossible
to
bear

cries
the
gentleman
,
clenching
his
hands
and
looking
upwards
in
agony
,
"
she
is
going
to
insist
upon
it
that
Morgan
is
Jenkins

"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
take
me
for
a
perfect
fool

<EOS>
"
exclaims
the
lady
;
"
do
you
suppose
I
do
n't
know
the

<EOS>
Do
you
suppose
I
do
n't
know
that
the
man
in
the
blue
coat
was
Mr
Jenkins

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jenkins
in
a
blue
coat

"
<EOS>
cries
the
gentleman
with
a
groan
;
<EOS>
"
Jenkins
in
a
blue
coat
!
<EOS>
a
man
who
would
suffer
death
rather
than
wear
anything

brown

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
dare
to
charge
me
with
telling
an
untruth

"
<EOS>
demands
the
lady
,
bursting
into
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
charge
you
,
ma'am
,
"
retorts
the
gentleman
,
starting
up
,
"
with
being
a
monster
of
contradiction
,
a
monster
of
aggravation
,
a

<EOS>
---
what
have
I
done
that
I
should
be
doomed
to
hear
such
statements
!
"
  
<EOS>
Expressing
himself
with
great
scorn
and
anguish
,
the
gentleman
takes
up
his
candle
and
stalks
off
to
bed
,
where
feigning
to
be
fast
asleep
when
the
lady
comes
up
-
stairs
drowned
in
tears
,
murmuring
lamentations
over
her
hard
fate
and
indistinct
intentions
of
consulting
her
brothers
,
he
undergoes
the
secret
torture
of
hearing
her
exclaim
between
whiles
,
"
I
know
there
are
only
fourteen
doors
in
the
house
<EOS>
,
I
know
it
was
Mr
Jenkins
<EOS>
,
I
know
he
had
a
blue
coat
on
,
and
I
would
say
it
as
positively
as
I
do
now
,
if
they
were
the
last
words
I
had
to
speak

"
  
<EOS>
If
the
contradictory
couple
are
blessed
with
children
,
they
are
not
the
less
contradictory
on
that
account
.
 
<EOS>
Master
James
and
Miss
Charlotte
present
themselves
after
dinner
,
and
being
in
perfect
good
humour
,
and
finding
their
parents
in
the
same
amiable
state
,
augur
from
these
appearances
half
a
glass
of
wine
a
-
piece
and
other
extraordinary
indulgences
.
 
<EOS>
But
unfortunately
Master
James
,
growing
talkative
upon
such
prospects
,
asks
his
mamma
how
tall
Mrs
Parsons
is
,
and
whether
she
is
not
six
feet
high
;
to
which
his
mamma
replies
,
"
Yes
,
she
should
think
she
was
,
for
Mrs
Parsons
is
a
very
tall
lady
indeed
;
quite
a
giantess
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
Charlotte
,
"
cries
her
husband
,
"
do
not
tell
the
child
such
preposterous
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
Six
feet
high
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
replies
the
lady
,
"
surely
I
may
be
permitted
to
have
an
opinion
;
my
opinion
is
,
that
she
is
six
feet
high
---
at
least
six
feet
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Now
you
know
,
Charlotte
,
"
retorts
the
gentleman
sternly
,
"
that
that
is
NOT
your
opinion
---
that
you
have
no
such
idea
---
and
that
you
only
say
this
for
the
sake
of
contradiction
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
exceedingly
polite
,
"
his
wife
replies
;
"
to
be
wrong
about
such
a
paltry
question
as
anybody
's
height
,
would
be
no
great
crime
;
but
I
say
again
,
that
I
believe
Mrs
Parsons
to
be
six
feet
---
more
than
six
feet
;
<EOS>
nay
,
I
believe
you
know
her
to
be
full
six
feet
,
and
only
say
she
is
not
,
because
I
say
she
is
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
taunt
disposes
the
gentleman
to
become
violent
,
but
he
cheeks
himself
,
and
is
content
to
mutter
,
in
a
haughty
tone
,
"
Six
feet
---
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Parsons
six
feet
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
lady
answers
,
"
Yes
,
<EOS>
six
feet
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
am
glad
you
are
amused
,
and
I
'll
say
it
again
---
six
feet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
the
subject
gradually
drops
off
,
and
the
contradiction
begins
to
be
forgotten
,
when
Master
James
,
with
some
undefined
notion
of
making
himself
agreeable
,
and
putting
things
to
rights
again
,
unfortunately
asks
his
mamma
what
the
moon
's
made
of
;
which
gives
her
occasion
to
say
that
he
had
better
not
ask
her
,
for
she
is
always
wrong
and
never
can
be
right
;
that
he
only
exposes
her
to
contradiction
by
asking
any
question
of
her
;
and
that
he
had
better
ask
his
papa
,
who
is
infallible
,
and
never
can
be
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
Papa
,
smarting
under
this
attack
,
gives
a
terrible
pull
at
the
bell
,
and
says
,
that
if
the
conversation
is
to
proceed
in
this
way
,
the
children
had
better
be
removed
.
 
<EOS>
Removed
they
are
,
after
a
few
tears
and
many
struggles
;
and
Pa
having
looked
at
Ma
sideways
for
a
minute
or
two
,
with
a
baleful
eye
,
draws
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
over
his
face
,
and
composes
himself
for
his
after
-
dinner
nap
.
  
<EOS>
The
friends
of
the
contradictory
couple
often
deplore
their
frequent
disputes
,
though
they
rather
make
light
of
them
at
the
same
time
:
 
observing
,
that
there
is
no
doubt
they
are
very
much
attached
to
each
other
,
and
that
they
never
quarrel
except
about
trifles
.
 
<EOS>
But
neither
the
friends
of
the
contradictory
couple
,
nor
the
contradictory
couple
themselves
,
reflect
,
that
as
the
most
stupendous
objects
in
nature
are
but
vast
collections
of
minute
particles
,
so
the
slightest
and
least
considered
trifles
make
up
the
sum
of
human
happiness
or
misery
.
    
<EOS>
The
Couple
Who
Dote
Upon
Their
Children
    
<EOS>
The
couple
who
dote
upon
their
children
have
usually
a
great
many
of
them
:
 
six
or
eight
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
The
children
are
either
the
healthiest
in
all
the
world
,
or
the
most
unfortunate
in
existence
.
<EOS>
In
either
case
,
they
are
equally
the
theme
of
their
doting
parents
,
and
equally
a
source
of
mental
anguish
and
irritation
to
their
doting
parents
'
friends
.
  
<EOS>
The
couple
who
dote
upon
their
children
recognise
no
dates
but
those
connected
with
their
births
,
accidents
,
illnesses
,
or
remarkable
deeds
.
 
<EOS>
They
keep
a
mental
almanack
with
a
vast
number
of
Innocents'-days
,
all
in
red
letters
.
 
<EOS>
They
recollect
the
last
coronation
,
because
on
that
day
little
Tom
fell
down
the
kitchen
stairs
;
the
anniversary
of
the
Gunpowder
Plot
,
because
it
was
on
the
fifth
of
November
that
Ned
asked
whether
wooden
legs
were
made
in
heaven
and
cocked
hats
grew
in
gardens
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Whiffler
will
never
cease
to
recollect
the
last
day
of
the
old
year
as
long
as
she
lives
,
for
it
was
on
that
day
that
the
baby
had
the
four
red
spots
on
its
nose
which
they
took
for
measles
:
 
nor
Christmas
-
day
,
for
twenty
-
one
days
after
Christmas
-
day
the
twins
were
born
;
nor
Good
Friday
,
for
it
was
on
a
Good
Friday
that
she
was
frightened
by
the
donkey
-
cart
when
she
was
in
the
family
way
with
Georgiana
.
 
<EOS>
The
movable
feasts
have
no
motion
for
Mr
and
Mrs
Whiffler
,
but
remain
pinned
down
tight
and
fast
to
the
shoulders
of
some
small
child
,
from
whom
they
can
never
be
separated
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
Time
was
made
,
according
to
their
creed
,
not
for
slaves
but
for
girls
and
boys
;
the
restless
sands
in
his
glass
are
but
little
children
at
play
.
  
<EOS>
As
we
have
already
intimated
,
the
children
of
this
couple
can
know
no
medium
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
either
prodigies
of
good
health
or
prodigies
of
bad
health
;
whatever
they
are
,
they
must
be
prodigies
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Whiffler
must
have
to
describe
at
his
office
<EOS>
such
excruciating
agonies
constantly
undergone
by
his
eldest
boy
,
as
nobody
else
's
eldest
boy
ever
underwent
;
or
he
must
be
able
to
declare
that
there
never
was
a
child
endowed
with
such
amazing
health
,
such
an
indomitable
constitution
,
and
<EOS>
such
a
cast
-
iron
frame
,
as
his
child
.
<EOS>
His
children
must
be
,
in
some
respect
or
other
,
above
and
beyond
the
children
of
all
other
people
.
 
<EOS>
To
such
an
extent
is
this
feeling
pushed
,
that
we
were
once
slightly
acquainted
with
a
lady
and
gentleman
who
carried
their
heads
so
high
and
became
so
proud
after
their
youngest
child
fell
out
of
a
two
-
pair
-
of
-
stairs
window
without
hurting
himself
much
,
that
the
greater
part
of
their
friends
were
obliged
to
forego
their
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
But
perhaps
this
may
be
an
extreme
case
,
and
one
not
justly
entitled
to
be
considered
as
a
precedent
of
general
application
.
  
<EOS>
If
a
friend
happen
to
dine
in
a
friendly
way
with
one
of
these
couples
who
dote
upon
their
children
,
it
is
nearly
impossible
for
him
to
divert
the
conversation
from
their
favourite
topic
.
<EOS>
Everything
reminds
Mr
Whiffler
of
Ned
,
or
Mrs
Whiffler
of
Mary
Anne
,
or
of
the
time
before
Ned
was
born
,
or
the
time
before
Mary
Anne
was
thought
of
.
 
<EOS>
The
slightest
remark
,
however
harmless
in
itself
,
will
awaken
slumbering
recollections
of
the
twins
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
steer
clear
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
will
come
uppermost
<EOS>
,
let
the
poor
man
do
what
he
may
.
 
<EOS>
Ned
has
been
known
to
be
lost
sight
of
for
half
an
hour
,
Dick
has
been
forgotten
,
the
name
of
Mary
Anne
has
not
been
mentioned
,
but
the
twins
will
out
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
can
keep
down
the
twins
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
very
extraordinary
thing
,
Saunders
,
"
says
Mr
Whiffler
to
the
visitor
,
"
<EOS>
but
---
you
have
seen
our
little
babies
,
the
---
the
---
twins
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
friend
's
heart
sinks
within
him
as
he
answers
,
"
Oh
,
yes
---
often
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
talking
of
the
Pyramids
,
"
says
Mr
Whiffler
,
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
,
"
reminds
me
of
the
twins
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
very
extraordinary
thing
about
those
babies
<EOS>
---
what
colour
should
you
say
their
eyes
were
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
"
the
friend
stammers
,
"
I
hardly
know
how
to
answer
"
---
the
fact
being
,
that
except
as
the
friend
does
not
remember
to
have
heard
of
any
departure
from
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
in
the
instance
of
these
twins
,
they
might
have
no
eyes
at
all
for
aught
he
has
observed
to
the
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
say
they
were
red
,
I
suppose
?
"
says
Mr
Whiffler
.
 
<EOS>
The
friend
hesitates
,
and
rather
thinks
they
are
;
but
inferring
from
the
expression
of
Mr
Whiffler
's
face
that
red
is
not
the
colour
<EOS>
,
smiles
with
some
confidence
,
and
says
,
"
No
,
no
!
very
different
from
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
should
you
say
to
blue
?
"
says
Mr
Whiffler
.
 
<EOS>
The
friend
glances
at
him
,
and
observing
a
different
expression
in
his
face
,
ventures
to
say
,
"
I
should
say
they
WERE
blue
---
a
decided
blue
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
!
"
<EOS>
cries
Mr
Whiffler
,
triumphantly
,
"
<EOS>
I
knew
you
would
!
 
<EOS>
But
what
should
you
say
if
I
was
to
tell
you
that
the
boy
's
eyes
are
blue
and
the
girl
's
hazel
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Impossible
!
"
exclaims
the
friend
,
not
at
all
knowing
why
it
should
be
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
fact
,
notwithstanding
<EOS>
,
"
cries
Mr
Whiffler
;
"
and
let
me
tell
you
,
Saunders
,
THAT
'S
not
a
common
thing
in
twins
,
or
a
circumstance
that
'll
happen
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
this
dialogue
Mrs
Whiffler
,
as
being
deeply
responsible
for
the
twins
,
their
charms
and
singularities
,
has
taken
no
share
;
but
she
now
relates
,
in
broken
English
,
a
witticism
of
little
Dick
's
bearing
upon
the
subject
just
discussed
,
which
delights
Mr
Whiffler
beyond
measure
,
and
causes
him
to
declare
that
he
would
have
sworn
that
was
Dick
's
if
he
had
heard
it
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
requests
that
Mrs
Whiffler
will
tell
Saunders
what
Tom
said
about
mad
bulls
;
and
Mrs
Whiffler
relating
the
anecdote
,
a
discussion
ensues
upon
the
different
character
of
Tom
's
wit
and
Dick
's
wit
,
from
which
it
appears
that
Dick
's
humour
is
of
a
lively
turn
,
while
Tom
's
style
is
the
dry
and
caustic
.
 
<EOS>
This
discussion
being
enlivened
by
various
illustrations
,
lasts
a
long
time
,
and
is
only
stopped
by
Mrs
Whiffler
instructing
the
footman
to
ring
the
nursery
bell
,
as
the
children
were
promised
that
they
should
come
down
and
taste
the
pudding
.
  
<EOS>
The
friend
turns
pale
when
this
order
is
given
,
and
paler
still
when
it
is
followed
up
by
a
great
pattering
on
the
staircase
,
(
not
unlike
the
sound
of
rain
upon
a
skylight
,
)
a
violent
bursting
open
of
the
dining
-
room
door
,
and
the
tumultuous
appearance
of
six
small
children
,
closely
succeeded
by
a
strong
nursery
-
maid
with
a
twin
in
each
arm
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
whole
eight
are
screaming
,
shouting
,
or
kicking
---
<EOS>
some
influenced
by
a
ravenous
appetite
,
some
by
a
horror
of
the
stranger
,
and
some
by
a
conflict
of
the
two
feelings
---
a
pretty
long
space
elapses
before
all
their
heads
can
be
ranged
round
the
table
and
anything
like
order
restored
;
in
bringing
about
which
happy
state
of
things
<EOS>
both
the
nurse
and
footman
are
severely
scratched
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
<EOS>
Mrs
Whiffler
is
heard
to
say
,
"
Mr
Saunders
,
shall
I
give
you
some
pudding
?
"
 
<EOS>
A
breathless
silence
ensues
,
and
sixteen
small
eyes
are
fixed
upon
the
guest
in
expectation
of
his
reply
.
 
<EOS>
A
wild
shout
of
joy
proclaims
that
he
has
said
"
No
,
thank
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Spoons
are
waved
in
the
air
,
legs
appear
above
the
table
-
cloth
in
uncontrollable
ecstasy
,
and
eighty
short
fingers
dabble
in
damson
syrup
.
  
<EOS>
While
the
pudding
is
being
disposed
of
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Whiffler
look
on
with
beaming
countenances
,
and
Mr
Whiffler
nudging
his
friend
Saunders
,
begs
him
to
take
notice
of
Tom
's
eyes
,
or
Dick
's
chin
,
or
Ned
's
nose
,
or
Mary
Anne
's
hair
,
or
Emily
's
figure
,
or
little
Bob
's
calves
,
or
Fanny
's
mouth
,
or
Carry
's
head
,
as
the
case
may
be
.
<EOS>
Whatever
the
attention
of
Mr
Saunders
is
called
to
,
Mr
Saunders
admires
of
course
;
though
he
is
rather
confused
about
the
sex
of
the
youngest
branches
and
looks
at
the
wrong
children
,
turning
to
a
girl
when
Mr
Whiffler
directs
his
attention
to
a
boy
,
and
falling
into
raptures
with
a
boy
when
he
ought
to
be
enchanted
with
a
girl
.
<EOS>
Then
the
dessert
comes
,
and
there
is
a
vast
deal
of
scrambling
after
fruit
,
and
sudden
spirting
forth
of
juice
out
of
tight
oranges
into
infant
eyes
,
and
much
screeching
and
wailing
in
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
it
becomes
time
for
Mrs
Whiffler
to
retire
,
and
all
the
children
are
by
force
of
arms
compelled
to
kiss
and
love
Mr
Saunders
before
going
up
-
stairs
,
except
Tom
,
who
,
lying
on
his
back
in
the
hall
,
proclaims
that
Mr
Saunders
"
is
a
naughty
beast
;
"
and
Dick
,
who
having
drunk
his
father
's
wine
when
he
was
looking
another
way
,
is
found
to
be
intoxicated
and
is
carried
out
,
very
limp
and
helpless
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Whiffler
and
his
friend
are
left
alone
together
,
but
Mr
Whiffler
's
thoughts
are
still
with
his
family
,
if
his
family
are
not
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Saunders
,
"
says
he
,
after
a
short
silence
,
"
if
you
please
,
we
'll
drink
Mrs
Whiffler
and
the
children
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Saunders
feels
this
to
be
a
reproach
against
himself
for
not
proposing
the
same
sentiment
,
and
drinks
it
in
some
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
Mr
Whiffler
sighs
,
"
these
children
,
Saunders
,
make
one
quite
an
old
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Saunders
thinks
that
if
they
were
his
,
they
would
make
him
a
very
old
man
;
but
he
says
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
yet
,
"
pursues
Mr
Whiffler
,
"
what
can
equal
domestic
happiness
?
<EOS>
what
can
equal
the
engaging
ways
of
children
!
 
<EOS>
Saunders
,
why
do
n't
you
get
married
?
"
<EOS>
Now
,
this
is
an
embarrassing
question
,
because
Mr
Saunders
has
been
thinking
that
if
he
had
at
any
time
entertained
matrimonial
designs
,
the
revelation
of
that
day
would
surely
have
routed
them
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
,
however
,
"
says
Mr
Whiffler
,
"
that
you
ARE
a
bachelor
,
---
<EOS>
glad
on
one
account
,
Saunders
;
a
selfish
one
<EOS>
,
I
admit
.
<EOS>
Will
you
do
Mrs
Whiffler
and
myself
a
favour
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Saunders
is
surprised
---
evidently
surprised
;
but
he
replies
,
"
with
the
greatest
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
will
you
,
Saunders
,
"
says
Mr
Whiffler
,
in
an
impressive
manner
,
"
will
you
cement
and
consolidate
our
friendship
by
coming
into
the
family
(
so
to
speak
)
as
a
godfather
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
proud
and
delighted
,
"
replies
Mr
Saunders
:
 
"
which
of
the
children
is
it
?
<EOS>
really
,
I
thought
they
were
all
christened
;
or
---
"
"
Saunders
,
"
Mr
Whiffler
interposes
,
"
they
ARE
all
christened
;
you
are
right
.
 
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
that
Mrs
Whiffler
is
---
in
short
,
we
expect
another
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
ninth
!
"
<EOS>
cries
the
friend
,
all
aghast
at
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Saunders
,
"
rejoins
Mr
Whiffler
,
solemnly
,
"
a
ninth
.
 
<EOS>
Did
we
drink
Mrs
Whiffler
's
health
?
 
<EOS>
Let
us
drink
it
again
,
Saunders
,
and
wish
her
well
over
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Doctor
Johnson
used
to
tell
a
story
of
a
man
who
had
but
one
idea
,
which
was
a
wrong
one
.
 
<EOS>
The
couple
who
dote
upon
their
children
are
in
the
same
predicament
:
 
at
home
or
abroad
,
at
all
times
,
and
in
all
places
,
their
thoughts
are
bound
up
in
this
one
subject
,
and
have
no
sphere
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
They
relate
the
clever
things
their
offspring
say
or
do
,
and
weary
every
company
with
their
prolixity
and
absurdity
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Whiffler
takes
a
friend
by
the
button
at
a
street
corner
on
a
windy
day
to
tell
him
a
BON
MOT
of
his
youngest
boy
's
;
and
Mrs
Whiffler
,
calling
to
see
a
sick
acquaintance
,
entertains
her
with
a
cheerful
account
of
all
<EOS>
her
own
past
sufferings
and
present
expectations
.
 
<EOS>
In
such
cases
the
sins
of
the
fathers
indeed
descend
upon
the
children
;
for
people
soon
come
to
regard
them
as
predestined
little
bores
.
 
<EOS>
The
couple
who
dote
upon
their
children
can
not
be
said
to
be
actuated
by
a
general
love
for
these
engaging
little
people
(
which
would
be
a
great
excuse
)
;
for
they
are
apt
to
underrate
and
entertain
a
jealousy
of
any
children
but
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
examined
their
own
hearts
,
they
would
,
perhaps
,
find
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
,
more
self
-
love
and
egotism
than
they
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
Self
-
love
and
egotism
are
bad
qualities
,
of
which
the
unrestrained
exhibition
,
though
it
may
be
sometimes
amusing
,
never
fails
to
be
wearisome
and
unpleasant
.
 
<EOS>
Couples
who
dote
upon
their
children
,
therefore
,
are
best
avoided
.
    
<EOS>
The
Cool
Couple
    
<EOS>
There
is
an
old
-
fashioned
weather
-
glass
representing
a
house
with
two
doorways
,
in
one
of
which
is
the
figure
of
a
gentleman
,
in
the
other
the
figure
of
a
lady
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
weather
is
to
be
fine
the
lady
comes
out
and
the
gentleman
goes
in
;
when
wet
,
the
gentleman
comes
out
and
the
lady
goes
in
.
 
<EOS>
They
never
seek
each
other
's
society
,
are
never
elevated
and
depressed
by
the
same
cause
,
and
have
nothing
in
common
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
the
model
of
a
cool
couple
,
except
that
there
is
something
of
politeness
and
consideration
about
the
behaviour
of
the
gentleman
in
the
weather
-
glass
,
in
which
,
neither
of
the
cool
couple
can
be
said
to
participate
.
  
<EOS>
The
cool
couple
are
seldom
alone
together
,
and
when
they
are
,
nothing
can
exceed
their
apathy
and
dulness
:
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
being
for
the
most
part
drowsy
,
and
the
lady
silent
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
enter
into
conversation
,
it
is
usually
of
an
ironical
or
recriminatory
nature
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
when
the
gentleman
has
indulged
in
a
very
long
yawn
and
settled
himself
more
snugly
in
his
easy
-
chair
,
the
lady
will
perhaps
remark
,
"
Well
,
I
am
sure
,
Charles
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
're
comfortable
.
"
 
<EOS>
To
which
the
gentleman
replies
,
"
Oh
yes
,
he
's
quite
comfortable
quite
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
are
not
many
married
men
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
"
returns
the
lady
,
"
who
seek
comfort
in
such
selfish
gratifications
as
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
many
wives
who
seek
comfort
in
such
selfish
gratifications
as
YOU
do
,
I
hope
,
"
retorts
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whose
fault
is
that
?
<EOS>
"
demands
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
becoming
more
sleepy
,
returns
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whose
fault
is
that
?
"
<EOS>
the
lady
repeats
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
still
returning
no
answer
,
she
goes
on
to
say
that
she
believes
there
never
was
in
all
this
world
<EOS>
anybody
so
attached
to
her
home
,
so
thoroughly
domestic
<EOS>
,
so
unwilling
to
seek
a
moment
's
gratification
or
pleasure
beyond
her
own
fireside
as
she
.
 
<EOS>
God
knows
that
before
she
was
married
she
never
thought
or
dreamt
of
such
a
thing
;
and
she
remembers
that
her
poor
papa
used
to
say
again
and
again
,
almost
every
day
of
his
life
,
"
Oh
,
my
dear
Louisa
,
if
you
only
marry
a
man
who
understands
you
,
and
takes
the
trouble
to
consider
your
happiness
and
accommodate
himself
a
very
little
to
your
disposition
,
what
a
treasure
he
will
find
in
you
!
"
<EOS>
She
supposes
her
papa
knew
what
her
disposition
was
---
he
had
known
her
long
enough
---
he
ought
to
have
been
acquainted
with
it
,
but
what
can
she
do
?
 
<EOS>
If
her
home
is
always
dull
and
lonely
,
and
her
husband
is
always
absent
and
finds
no
pleasure
in
her
society
,
she
is
naturally
sometimes
driven
(
seldom
enough
,
she
is
sure
)
to
seek
a
little
recreation
elsewhere
;
she
is
not
expected
to
pine
and
mope
to
death
,
she
hopes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
come
,
Louisa
,
"
says
the
gentleman
,
waking
up
as
suddenly
as
he
fell
asleep
,
"
stop
at
home
this
evening
,
and
so
will
I.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
sorry
to
suppose
,
Charles
,
that
you
took
a
pleasure
in
aggravating
me
,
"
replies
the
lady
;
"
but
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
that
I
am
particularly
engaged
to
Mrs
Mortimer
,
and
that
it
would
be
an
act
of
the
grossest
rudeness
and
ill
-
breeding
,
after
accepting
a
seat
in
her
box
and
preventing
her
from
inviting
anybody
else
,
not
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
there
it
is
!
"
says
the
gentleman
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
"
I
knew
that
perfectly
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
you
could
n't
devote
an
evening
to
your
own
home
.
 
<EOS>
Now
all
I
have
to
say
,
Louisa
,
is
this
---
<EOS>
recollect
that
I
was
quite
willing
to
stay
at
home
,
and
that
it
's
no
fault
of
MINE
<EOS>
we
are
not
oftener
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
the
gentleman
goes
away
to
keep
an
old
appointment
at
his
club
,
and
the
lady
hurries
off
to
dress
for
Mrs
Mortimer
's
;
and
neither
thinks
of
the
other
until
by
some
odd
chance
they
find
themselves
alone
again
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
cool
couple
are
habitually
a
quarrelsome
one
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
the
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
These
differences
are
only
occasions
for
a
little
self
-
excuse
,
---
nothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
In
general
they
are
as
easy
and
careless
,
and
dispute
as
seldom
,
as
any
common
acquaintances
may
;
for
it
is
neither
worth
their
while
to
put
each
other
out
of
the
way
,
nor
to
ruffle
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
meet
in
society
,
the
cool
couple
are
the
best
-
bred
people
in
existence
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
is
seated
in
a
corner
among
a
little
knot
of
lady
friends
,
one
of
whom
exclaims
,
"
Why
,
I
vow
and
declare
there
is
your
husband
,
my
dear
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Whose
?
---
mine
?
"
<EOS>
she
says
,
carelessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
yours
,
and
coming
this
way
too
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
very
odd
!
"
says
the
lady
,
in
a
languid
tone
,
"
<EOS>
I
thought
he
had
been
at
Dover
.
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
coming
up
,
and
speaking
to
all
the
other
ladies
and
nodding
slightly
to
his
wife
,
it
turns
out
that
he
has
been
at
Dover
,
and
has
just
now
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
strange
creature
you
are
!
"
<EOS>
cries
his
wife
;
"
and
what
on
earth
brought
you
here
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
came
to
look
after
you
,
OF
COURSE
,
"
rejoins
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
so
pleasant
a
jest
that
the
lady
is
mightily
amused
,
as
are
all
the
other
ladies
similarly
situated
who
are
within
hearing
;
and
while
they
are
enjoying
it
to
the
full
,
the
gentleman
nods
again
,
turns
upon
his
heel
,
and
saunters
away
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
times
,
however
,
when
his
company
is
not
so
agreeable
,
though
equally
unexpected
;
such
as
when
the
lady
has
invited
one
or
two
particular
friends
to
tea
and
scandal
,
and
he
happens
to
come
home
in
the
very
midst
of
their
diversion
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
hundred
chances
to
one
that
he
remains
in
the
house
half
an
hour
,
but
the
lady
is
rather
disturbed
by
the
intrusion
,
notwithstanding
,
and
reasons
within
herself
,
---
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
never
interfere
with
him
,
and
why
should
he
interfere
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
It
can
scarcely
be
accidental
;
it
never
happens
that
I
have
a
particular
reason
for
not
wishing
him
to
come
home
,
but
he
always
comes
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
very
provoking
and
tiresome
;
and
I
am
sure
when
he
leaves
me
so
much
alone
for
his
own
pleasure
,
the
least
he
could
do
would
be
to
do
as
much
for
mine
.
<EOS>
"
Observing
what
passes
in
her
mind
,
the
gentleman
,
who
has
come
home
for
his
own
accommodation
,
makes
a
merit
of
it
with
himself
;
arrives
at
the
conclusion
that
it
is
the
very
last
place
in
which
he
can
hope
to
be
comfortable
;
and
determines
,
as
he
takes
up
his
hat
and
cane
,
never
to
be
so
virtuous
again
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
a
great
many
cool
couples
go
on
until
they
are
cold
couples
,
and
the
grave
has
closed
over
their
folly
and
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
Loss
of
name
,
station
,
character
,
life
itself
,
has
ensued
from
causes
as
slight
as
these
,
before
now
;
and
when
gossips
tell
such
tales
,
and
aggravate
their
deformities
,
they
elevate
their
hands
and
eyebrows
,
and
call
each
other
to
witness
what
a
cool
couple
Mr
and
Mrs
So
-
and
-
so
always
were
,
even
in
the
best
of
times
.
    
<EOS>
The
Plausible
Couple
    
<EOS>
The
plausible
couple
have
many
titles
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
"
a
delightful
couple
,
"
an
"
affectionate
couple
,
"
"
a
most
agreeable
couple
,
"
a
good
-
hearted
couple
,
"
and
"
the
best
-
natured
couple
in
existence
.
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
that
the
plausible
couple
are
people
of
the
world
;
and
either
the
way
of
pleasing
the
world
has
grown
much
easier
than
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
old
man
and
his
ass
,
or
the
old
man
was
but
a
bad
hand
at
it
,
and
knew
very
little
of
the
trade
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
is
it
really
possible
to
please
the
world
!
"
says
some
doubting
reader
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
it
is
not
only
very
possible
,
but
very
easy
.
 
<EOS>
The
ways
are
crooked
,
and
sometimes
foul
and
low
.
 
<EOS>
What
then
?
 
<EOS>
A
man
need
but
crawl
upon
his
hands
and
knees
,
know
when
to
close
his
eyes
and
when
his
ears
,
when
to
stoop
and
when
to
stand
upright
;
and
if
by
the
world
is
meant
that
atom
of
it
in
which
he
moves
himself
,
he
shall
please
it
,
never
fear
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
it
will
be
readily
seen
,
that
if
a
plausible
man
or
woman
have
an
easy
means
of
pleasing
the
world
by
an
adaptation
of
self
to
all
its
twistings
and
twinings
,
a
plausible
man
AND
woman
,
or
,
in
other
words
,
a
plausible
couple
,
playing
into
each
other
's
hands
,
and
acting
in
concert
,
have
a
manifest
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
it
is
that
plausible
couples
scarcely
ever
fail
of
success
on
a
pretty
large
scale
;
and
hence
it
is
that
if
the
reader
,
laying
down
this
unwieldy
volume
at
the
next
full
stop
,
will
have
the
goodness
to
review
his
or
her
circle
of
acquaintance
,
and
to
search
particularly
for
some
man
and
wife
with
a
large
connexion
and
a
good
name
,
not
easily
referable
to
their
abilities
or
their
wealth
,
he
or
she
(
that
is
,
the
male
or
female
reader
)
will
certainly
find
that
gentleman
or
lady
,
on
a
very
short
reflection
,
to
be
a
plausible
couple
.
  
<EOS>
The
plausible
couple
are
the
most
ecstatic
people
living
:
 
the
most
sensitive
people
---
to
merit
---
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
clever
or
virtuous
escapes
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
microscopic
eyes
for
such
endowments
,
and
can
find
them
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
The
plausible
couple
never
fawn
---
<EOS>
oh
no
!
 
<EOS>
They
do
n't
even
scruple
to
tell
their
friends
of
their
faults
.
 
<EOS>
One
is
too
generous
,
another
too
candid
;
a
third
has
a
tendency
to
think
all
people
like
himself
,
and
to
regard
mankind
as
a
company
of
angels
;
a
fourth
is
kind
-
hearted
to
a
fault
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
never
flatter
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Mrs
Jackson
,
"
say
the
plausible
couple
;
"
we
speak
our
minds
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
you
nor
Mr

have
faults
enough

It

strangely

it

You

You

out

Quarrel
with
us
for
saying
so
,
if
you
will
;
but
we
repeat
it
,
---
you
have
not
faults
enough

"
  
<EOS>
The
plausible
couple
are
no
less
plausible
to
each
other
than
to
third
parties
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
always
loving
and
harmonious
.
 
<EOS>
The
plausible
gentleman
calls
his
wife
"
darling

"
and
the
plausible
lady
addresses
him
as
"
dearest

"
 
<EOS>
If
it
be
Mr

Mrs
Bobtail
Widger
,
Mrs
Widger
is
"
Lavinia
,
darling
,
"
and
Mr
Widger
is
"
Bobtail
,
dearest

"
 
<EOS>
Speaking
of
each
other
,
they
observe
the
same
tender
form
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Widger
relates
what
"
Bobtail
"
said
,
and
Mr
Widger
recounts
what
"
darling
"
thought
and
did
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
sit
next
to
the
plausible
lady
at
a
dinner
-
table
,
she
takes
the
earliest
opportunity
of
expressing
her
belief
that
you
are
acquainted
with
the
Clickits
;
she
is
sure
she
has
heard
the
Clickits
speak
of
you
---
she
must
not
tell
you
in
what
terms
,
or
you
will
take
her
for
a
flatterer
.
 
<EOS>
You
admit
a
knowledge
of
the
Clickits
;
the
plausible
lady
immediately
launches
out
in
their
praise
.
 
<EOS>
She
quite
loves
the
Clickits
.
 
<EOS>
Were
there
ever
such
true
-
hearted
,
hospitable
,
excellent
people
---
such
a
gentle
,
interesting
little
woman
as
Mrs
Clickit
,
or
such
a
frank
,
unaffected
creature
as
Mr
Clickit
?
<EOS>
were
there
ever
two
people
,
in
short
,
so
little
spoiled
by
the
world
as
they
are
?
 
<EOS>
"
As
who

"
cries
Mr
Widger
,
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Clickits
,
dearest
,
"
replies
Mrs
Widger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
are
right

darling

"
Mr
Widger
rejoins
;
"
the
Clickits
are
a
very
high
-
minded
,
worthy
,
estimable
couple
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Widger
remarking
that
Bobtail
always
grows
quite
eloquent
upon
this
subject
,
Mr
Widger
admits
that
he
feels
very
strongly
whenever
such
people
as
the
Clickits
and
some
other
friends
of
his
(
here
he
glances
at
the
host
and
hostess
)
are
mentioned
;
for
they
are
an
honour
to
human
nature
,
and
do
one
good
to
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
"
YOU
know
the
Clickits
,
Mrs
Jackson
?
"
he
says
,
addressing
the
lady
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
;
we
have
not
that
pleasure
,
"
she
replies
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
astonish
me
!
"
<EOS>
exclaims
Mr
Widger
:
<EOS>
"
not
know
the
Clickits
!
<EOS>
why
,
you
are
the
very
people
of
all
others
who
ought
to
be
their
bosom
friends

<EOS>
You
are
kindred
beings
;
you
are
one
and
the

thing
:
---
not
know
the
Clickits

<EOS>
Now
WILL
you
know
the
Clickits
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
make
a
point
of
knowing
them
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
meet
them
in
a
friendly
way
at
our
house
one
evening
,
and
be
acquainted
with
them
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jackson
will
be
quite
delighted
;
nothing
would
give
her
more
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Lavinia
,
my
darling
,
"
says
Mr
Widger
,
"
mind
<EOS>
you
do
n't
lose
sight

now

pray
take
care
that
Mr

know
the

Such
people

<EOS>
Mrs
Widger
books
both
families
as
the
centre
of
attraction
for
her
next
party
;
and
Mr
Widger
,
going
on
to
expatiate
upon
the
virtues
of
the
Clickits
,
adds
to
their
other
moral
qualities
,
that
they
keep
one
of
the
neatest
phaetons
in
town
,
and
have
two
thousand
a
year
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
plausible
couple
never
laud
the
merits
of
any
absent
person
,
without
dexterously
contriving
that
their
praises
shall
reflect
upon
somebody
who
is
present
,
so
they
never
depreciate
anything
or
anybody
,
without
turning
their
depreciation
to
the
same
account
.
<EOS>
Their
friend
,
Mr
Slummery
,
say
they
,
is
unquestionably
a
clever
painter
,
and
would
no
doubt
be
very
popular
,
and
sell
his
pictures
at
a
very
high
price
,
if
that
cruel
Mr
Fithers
had
not
forestalled
him
in
his
department
of
art
,
and
made
it
thoroughly
and
completely
his
own
;
<EOS>
---
Fithers
,
it
is
to
be
observed
,
being
present
and
within
hearing
,
and
Slummery
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
Is
Mrs
Tabblewick
really
as
beautiful
as
people
say
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
there
indeed
you
ask
them
a
very
puzzling
question
,
because
there
is
no
doubt
that
she
is
a
very
charming
woman
,
and
they
have
long
known
her
intimately
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
no
doubt
beautiful
,
very
beautiful
;
they
once
thought
her
the
most
beautiful
woman
ever
seen
;
still
if
you
press
them
for
an
honest
answer
,
they
are
bound
to
say
that
this
was
before
they
had
ever
seen
our
lovely
friend
on
the
sofa
,
(
the
sofa
is
hard
by
,
and
our
lovely
friend
ca
n't
help
hearing
the
whispers
in
which
this
is
said
;
)
<EOS>
since
that
time
,
perhaps
,
they
have
been
hardly
fair
judges
;
Mrs
Tabblewick
is
no
doubt
extremely
handsome
,
---
very
like
our
friend
,
in
fact
,
in
the
form
of
the
features
,
---
but
in
point
of
expression
,
and
soul
,
and
figure
,
and
air
altogether
---
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
  
<EOS>
But
while
the
plausible
couple
depreciate
,
they
are
still
careful
to
preserve
their
character
for
amiability
and
kind
feeling
;
indeed
the
depreciation
itself
is
often
made
to
grow
out
of
their
excessive
sympathy
and
good
will
.

The
plausible

of
the
young
man
's
best
companion
,
---
a
little
woman
at
a
very
high
pressure
,
with
an
amazing
quantity
of
goodness
and
usefulness
in
an
exceedingly
small
space
.
 
<EOS>
Little
as
she
is
,
Mrs
Chirrup
might
furnish
forth
matter
for
the
moral
equipment
of
a
score
of
housewives
,
six
feet
high
in
their
stockings
---
if
,
in
the
presence
of
ladies
,
we
may
be
allowed
the
expression
---
and
of
corresponding
robustness
.
  
<EOS>
Nobody
knows
all
this
better
than
Mr
Chirrup
,
though
he
rather
takes
on
that
he
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
he
is
very
proud
of
his
better
-
half
,
and
evidently
considers
himself
,
as
all
other
people
consider
him
,
rather
fortunate
in
having
her
to
wife
.
 
<EOS>
We
say
evidently
,
because
Mr
Chirrup
is
a
warm
-
hearted
little
fellow
;
and
if
you
catch
his
eye
when
he
has
been
slyly
glancing
at
Mrs
Chirrup
in
company
,
there
is
a
certain
complacent
twinkle
in
it
,
accompanied
,
perhaps
,
by
a
half
-
expressed
toss
of
the
head
,
which
as
clearly
indicates
what
has
been
passing
in
his
mind
as
if
he
had
put
it
into
words
,
and
shouted
it
out
through
a
speaking
-
trumpet
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
Mr
Chirrup
has
a
particularly
mild
and
bird
-
like
manner
of
calling
Mrs
Chirrup
"
my
dear
;
"
and
---
for
he
is
of
a
jocose
turn
---
of
cutting
little
witticisms
upon
her
,
and
making
her
the
subject
of
various
harmless
pleasantries
,
which
nobody
enjoys
more
thoroughly
than
Mrs
Chirrup
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chirrup
,
too
,
now
and
then
affects
to
deplore
his
bachelor
-
days
,
<EOS>
and
to
bemoan
(
with
a
marvellously
contented
and
smirking
face
)
the
loss
of
his
freedom
,
and
the
sorrow
of
his
heart
at
having
been
taken
captive
by
Mrs
Chirrup
---
all
of
which
circumstances
combine
to
show
the
secret
triumph
and
satisfaction
of
Mr
Chirrup
's
soul
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
already
had
occasion
to
observe
that
Mrs
Chirrup
is
an
incomparable
housewife
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
the
arts
of
domestic
arrangement
and
management
,
in
all
the
mysteries
of
confectionery
-
making
,
pickling
,
and
preserving
,
never
was
such
a
thorough
adept
as
that
nice
little
body
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
,
besides
,
a
cunning
worker
in
muslin
and
fine
linen
,
and
a
special
hand
at
marketing
to
the
very
best
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
there
be
one
branch
of
housekeeping
in
which
she
excels
to
an
utterly
unparalleled
and
unprecedented
extent
,
it
is
in
the
important
one
of
carving
.
 
<EOS>
A
roast
goose
is
universally
allowed
to
be
the
great
stumbling
-
block
in
the
way
of
young
aspirants
to
perfection
in
this
department
of
science
;
many
promising
carvers
,
beginning
with
legs
of
mutton
,
and
preserving
a
good
reputation
through
fillets
of
veal
,
sirloins
of
beef
,
quarters
of
lamb
,
fowls
,
and
even
ducks
,
have
sunk
before
a
roast
goose
,
and
lost
caste
and
character
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
To
Mrs
Chirrup
<EOS>
the
resolving
a
goose
into
its
smallest
component
parts
is
a
pleasant
pastime
---
a
practical
joke
---
a
thing
to
be
done
in
a
minute
or
so
,
without
the
smallest
interruption
to
the
conversation
of
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
No
handing
the
dish
over
to
an
unfortunate
man
upon
her
right
or
left
,
no
wild
sharpening
of
the
knife
,
no
hacking
and
sawing
at
an
unruly
joint
,
no
noise
,
no
splash
,
<EOS>
no
heat
,
no
leaving
off
in
despair
;
all
is
confidence
and
cheerfulness
.
 
<EOS>
The
dish
is
set
upon
the
table
,
the
cover
is
removed
;
<EOS>
for
an
instant
,
and
only
an
instant
,
you
observe
that
Mrs
Chirrup
's
attention
is
distracted
;
she
smiles
,
but
heareth
not
.
 
<EOS>
You
proceed
with
your
story
;
meanwhile
the
glittering
knife
is
slowly
upraised
,
both
Mrs
Chirrup
's
wrists
are
slightly
but
not
ungracefully
agitated
,
she
compresses
her
lips
for
an
instant
,
then
breaks
into
a
smile
,
and
all
is
over
.
 
<EOS>
The
legs
of
the
bird
slide
gently
down
into
a
pool
of
gravy
,
the
wings
seem
to
melt
from
the
body
,
the
breast
separates
into
a
row
of
juicy
slices
,
the
smaller
and
more
complicated
parts
of
his
anatomy
are
perfectly
developed
,
a
cavern
of
stuffing
is
revealed
,
and
the
goose
is
gone
!
  
<EOS>
To
dine
with
Mr
and
Mrs
Chirrup
is
one
of
the
pleasantest
things
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chirrup
has
a
bachelor
friend
,
who
lived
with
him
in
his
own
days
of
single
blessedness
,
and
to
whom
he
is
mightily
attached
.
 
<EOS>
Contrary
to
the
usual
custom
,
this
bachelor
friend
is
no
less
a
friend
of
Mrs
Chirrup
's
,
and
,
consequently
,
whenever
you
dine
with
Mr
and
Mrs
Chirrup
,
you
meet
the
bachelor
friend
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
put
any
reasonably
-
conditioned
mortal
into
good
-
humour
to
observe
the
entire
unanimity
which
subsists
between
these
three
;
but
there
is
a
quiet
welcome
dimpling
in
Mrs
Chirrup
's
face
,
a
bustling
hospitality
oozing
as
it
were
out
of
the
waistcoat
-
pockets
of
Mr
Chirrup
,
and
a
patronising
enjoyment
of
their
cordiality
and
satisfaction
on
the
part
of
the
bachelor
friend
,
which
is
quite
delightful
.
 
<EOS>
On
these
occasions
Mr
Chirrup
usually
takes
an
opportunity
of
rallying
the
friend
on
being
single
,
and
the
friend
retorts
on
Mr
Chirrup
for
being
married
,
at
which
moments
some
single
young
ladies
present
are
like
to
die
of
laughter
;
and
we
have
more
than
once
observed
them
bestow
looks
upon
the
friend
,
which
convinces
us
that
his
position
is
by
no
means
a
safe
one
,
as
,
indeed
<EOS>
,
we
hold
no
bachelor
's
to
be
who
visits
married
friends
and
cracks
jokes
on
wedlock
,
<EOS>
for
certain
it
is
that
such
men
walk
among
traps
and
nets
and
pitfalls
innumerable
,
and
often
find
themselves
down
upon
their
knees
at
the
altar
rails
,
taking
M
or
N
for
their
wedded
wives
,
before
they
know
anything
about
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
this
is
no
business
of
Mr
Chirrup
's
,
who
talks
,
and
laughs
,
and
drinks
his
wine
,
and
laughs
again
,
and
talks
more
,
until
it
is
time
to
repair
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
where
,
coffee
served
and
over
,
Mrs
Chirrup
prepares
for
a
round
game
,
by
sorting
the
nicest
possible
little
fish
into
the
nicest
possible
little
pools
,
and
calling
Mr
Chirrup
to
assist
her
,
which
Mr
Chirrup
does
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
stand
side
by
side
,
you
find
that
Mr
Chirrup
is
the
least
possible
shadow
of
a
shade
taller
than
Mrs
Chirrup
,
and
that
they
are
the
neatest
and
best
-
matched
little
couple
that
can
be
,
which
the
chances
are
ten
to
one
against
your
observing
with
such
effect
at
any
other
time
,
unless
you
see
them
in
the
street
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
or
meet
them
some
rainy
day
trotting
along
under
a
very
small
umbrella
.
 
<EOS>
The
round
game
(
at
which
Mr
Chirrup
is
the
merriest
of
the
party
)
being
done
and
over
,
in
course
of
time
a
nice
little
tray
appears
,
on
which
is
a
nice
little
supper
;
and
when
that
is
finished
likewise
,
and
you
have
said
"
Good
night
,
"
you
find
yourself
repeating
a
dozen
times
,
as
you
ride
home
,
that
there
never
was
such
a
nice
little
couple
as
Mr
and
Mrs
Chirrup
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
it
is
that
pleasant
qualities
,
being
packed
more
closely
in
small
bodies
than
in
large
,
come
more
readily
to
hand
than
when
they
are
diffused
over
a
wider
space
,
and
have
to
be
gathered
together
for
use
,
we
do
n't
know
,
but
<EOS>
as
a
general
rule
,
---
strengthened
like
all
other
rules
by
its
exceptions
,
---
we
hold
that
little
people
are
sprightly
and
good
-
natured
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
sprightly
and
good
-
natured
people
we
have
,
the
better
;
therefore
,
let
us
wish
well
to
all
nice
little
couples
,
and
hope
that
they
may
increase
and
multiply
.
    
<EOS>
The
Egotistical
Couple
    
Egotism
in
couples
is
of
two
kinds
.
<EOS>
---
It
is
our
purpose
to
show
this
by
two
examples
.
  
<EOS>
The
egotistical
couple
may
be
young
,
old
,
middle
-
aged
,
well
to
do
,
or
ill
to
do
;
they
may
have
a
small
family
,
a
large
family
,
or
no
family
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
outward
sign
by
which
an
egotistical
couple
may
be
known
and
avoided
.
 
<EOS>
They
come
upon
you
unawares
;
there
is
no
guarding
against
them
.
 
<EOS>
No
man
can
of
himself
be
forewarned
or
forearmed
against
an
egotistical
couple
.
  
<EOS>
The
egotistical
couple
have
undergone
every
calamity
,
and
experienced
every
pleasurable
and
painful
sensation
of
which
our
nature
is
susceptible
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
by
possibility
tell
the
egotistical
couple
anything
they
do
n't
know
,
or
describe
to
them
anything
they
have
not
felt
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
been
everything
but
dead
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
we
are
tempted
to
wish
they
had
been
even
that
,
but
only
in
our
uncharitable
moments
,
which
are
few
and
far
between
.
  
<EOS>
We
happened
the
other
day
,
in
the
course
of
a
morning
call
,
to
encounter
an
egotistical
couple
,
nor
were
we
suffered
to
remain
long
in
ignorance
of
the
fact
,
for
our
very
first
inquiry
of
the
lady
of
the
house
brought
them
into
active
and
vigorous
operation
.
<EOS>
The
inquiry
was
of
course
touching
the
lady
's
health
,
and
the
answer
happened
to
be
,
that
she
had
not
been
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
egotistical
lady
,
"
do
n't
talk
of
not
being
well
.
<EOS>
We
have
been
in
SUCH
a
state
since
we
saw
you
last
!
"
<EOS>
---
The
lady
of
the
house
happening
to
remark
that
her
lord
had
not
been
well
either
,
the
egotistical
gentleman
struck
in
:
 
"
Never
let
Briggs
complain
of
not
being
well
---
never
let
Briggs
complain
,
my
dear
Mrs
Briggs
,
after
what
I
have
undergone
within
these
six
weeks
.
<EOS>
He
does
n't
know
what
it
is
to
be
ill
,
he
has
n't
the
least
idea
of
it
;
not
the
faintest
conception
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
My
dear
,
"
interposed
his
wife
smiling
,
"
you
talk
as
if
it
were
almost
a
crime
in
Mr
Briggs
not
to
have
been
as
ill
as
we
have
been
,
instead
of
feeling
thankful
to
Providence
that
both
he
and
our
dear
Mrs
Briggs
are
in
such
blissful
ignorance
of
real
suffering
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
My
love
,
"
returned
the
egotistical
gentleman
,
in
a
low
and
pious
voice
,
"
you
mistake
me
;
---
I
feel
grateful
---
very
grateful
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
our
friends
may
never
purchase
their
experience
as
dearly
as
we
have
bought
ours
;
I
hope
they
never
may
!
"
  
<EOS>
Having
put
down
Mrs
Briggs
upon
this
theme
,
and
settled
the
question
thus
,
the
egotistical
gentleman
turned
to
us
,
and
,
after
a
few
preliminary
remarks
,
all
tending
towards
and
leading
up
to
the
point
he
had
in
his
mind
,
inquired
if
we
happened
to
be
acquainted
with
the
Dowager
Lady
Snorflerer
.
 
<EOS>
On
our
replying
in
the
negative
,
he
presumed
we
had
often
met
Lord
Slang
,
or
beyond
all
doubt
,
that
we
were
on
intimate
terms
with
Sir
Chipkins
Glogwog
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
that
we
were
equally
unable
to
lay
claim
to
either
of
these
distinctions
,
he
expressed
great
astonishment
,
and
turning
to
his
wife
with
a
retrospective
smile
,
inquired
who
it
was
that
had
told
that
capital
story
about
the
mashed
potatoes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
,
my
dear
?
"
returned
the
egotistical
lady
,
"
why
Sir
Chipkins
,
of
course
;
how
can
you
ask
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
his
applying
it
to
our
cook
,
and
saying
that
you
and
I
were
so
like
the
Prince
and
Princess
,
that
he
could
almost
have
sworn
we
were
they
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
I
remember
that
,
"
said
the
egotistical
gentleman
,
"
but
are
you
quite
certain
that
did
n't
apply
to
the
other
anecdote
about
the
Emperor
of
Austria
and
the
pump
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
then
,
I
think
it
did
,
"
replied
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
it
did
,
"
said
the
egotistical
gentleman
,
"
it
was
Slang
's
story
,
<EOS>
I
remember
now
,
perfectly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
However
,
it
turned
out
,
a
few
seconds
afterwards
,
that
the
egotistical
gentleman
's
memory
was
rather
treacherous
,
as
he
began
to
have
a
misgiving
that
the
story
had
been
told
by
the
Dowager
Lady
Snorflerer
the
very
last
time
they
dined
there
;
but
there
appearing
,
on
further
consideration
,
strong
circumstantial
evidence
tending
to
show
that
this
could
n't
be
,
inasmuch
as
the
Dowager
Lady
Snorflerer
had
been
,
on
the
occasion
in
question
,
wholly
engrossed
by
the
egotistical
lady
,
the
egotistical
gentleman
recanted
this
opinion
;
and
after
laying
the
story
at
the
doors
of
a
great
many
great
people
,
happily
left
it
at
last
with
the
Duke
of
Scuttlewig
:
---
observing
that
it
was
not
extraordinary
he
had
forgotten
his
Grace
hitherto
,
as
it
often
happened
that
the
names
of
those
with
whom
we
were
upon
the
most
familiar
footing
were
the
very
last
to
present
themselves
to
our
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
It
not
only
appeared
that
the
egotistical
couple
knew
everybody
,
but
that
scarcely
any
event
of
importance
or
notoriety
had
occurred
for
many
years
with
which
they
had
not
been
in
some
way
or
other
connected
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
we
learned
that
when
the
well
-
known
attempt
upon
the
life
of
George
the
Third
was
made
by
Hatfield
in
Drury
Lane
theatre
,
the
egotistical
gentleman
's
grandfather
sat
upon
his
right
hand
and
was
the
first
man
who
collared
him
;
and
that
the
egotistical
lady
's
aunt
,
sitting
within
a
few
boxes
of
the
royal
party
,
was
the
only
person
in
the
audience
who
heard
his
Majesty
exclaim
,
"
Charlotte
,
Charlotte
,
do
n't
be
frightened
,
do
n't
be
frightened
;
they
're
letting
off
squibs
,
they
're
letting
off
squibs
.
"
 
<EOS>
When
the
fire
broke
out
,
which
ended
in
the
destruction
of
the
two
Houses
of
Parliament
,
the
egotistical
couple
,
being
at
the
time
at
a
drawing
-
room
window
on
Blackheath
,
then
and
there
simultaneously
exclaimed
,
to
the
astonishment
of
a
whole
party
---
"
It
's
the
House
of
Lords
!
"
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
a
solitary
instance
of
their
peculiar
discernment
,
for
chancing
to
be
(
as
by
a
comparison
of
dates
and
circumstances
they
afterwards
found
)
in
the
same
omnibus
with
Mr
Greenacre
,
<EOS>
when
he
carried
his
victim
's
head
about
town
in
a
blue
bag
,
they
both
remarked
a
singular
twitching
in
the
muscles
of
his
countenance
;
and
walking
down
Fish
Street
Hill
,
a
few
weeks
since
,
the
egotistical
gentleman
said
to
his
lady
---
slightly
casting
up
his
eyes
to
the
top
of
the
Monument
---
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
boy
up
there
,
my
dear
,
reading
a
Bible
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
very
strange
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
it
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
In
five
seconds
afterwards
,
Sir
,
"
says
the
egotistical
gentleman
,
bringing
his
hands
together
with
one
violent
clap
---
"
the
lad
was
over
!
"
  
<EOS>
Diversifying
these
topics
by
the
introduction
of
many
others
of
the
same
kind
,
and
entertaining
us
between
whiles
with
a
minute
account
of
what
weather
and
diet
agreed
with
them
,
and
what
weather
and
diet
disagreed
with
them
,
and
at
what
time
they
usually
got
up
,
and
at
what
time
went
to
bed
,
with
many
other
particulars
of
their
domestic
economy
too
numerous
to
mention
;
the
egotistical
couple
at
length
took
their
leave
,
and
afforded
us
an
opportunity
of
doing
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Sliverstone
are
an
egotistical
couple
of
another
class
,
for
all
the
lady
's
egotism
is
about
her
husband
,
and
all
the
gentleman
's
about
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
For
example
:
---
Mr
Sliverstone
is
a
clerical
gentleman
,
and
occasionally
writes
sermons
,
as
clerical
gentlemen
do
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
happen
to
obtain
admission
at
the
street
-
door
while
he
is
so
engaged
,
Mrs
Sliverstone
appears
on
tip
-
toe
,
and
speaking
in
a
solemn
whisper
,
as
if
there
were
at
least
three
or
four
particular
friends
up
-
stairs
,
all
upon
the
point
of
death
,
implores
you
to
be
very
silent
,
for
Mr
Sliverstone
is
composing
,
and
she
need
not
say
how
very
important
it
is
that
he
should
not
be
disturbed
.
 
<EOS>
Unwilling
to
interrupt
anything
so
serious
,
you
hasten
to
withdraw
,
with
many
apologies
;
but
this
Mrs
Sliverstone
will
by
no
means
allow
,
observing
,
that
she
knows
you
would
like
to
see
him
,
as
it
is
very
natural
<EOS>
you
should
,
and
that
she
is
determined
to
make
a
trial
for
you
,
as
you
are
a
great
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
are
led
up
-
stairs
---
still
on
tip
-
toe
---
to
the
door
of
a
little
back
room
,
in
which
,
as
the
lady
informs
you
in
a
whisper
,
Mr
Sliverstone
always
writes
.
 
<EOS>
No
answer
being
returned
to
a
couple
of
soft
taps
,
the
lady
opens
the
door
,
and
there
,
sure
enough
,
is
Mr
Sliverstone
,
with
dishevelled
hair
,
powdering
away
with
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
at
a
rate
which
,
if
he
has
any
power
of
sustaining
it
,
would
settle
the
longest
sermon
in
no
time
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
he
is
too
much
absorbed
to
be
roused
by
this
intrusion
;
but
presently
looking
up
,
says
faintly
,
"
Ah
!
"
and
pointing
to
his
desk
with
a
weary
and
languid
smile
,
extends
his
hand
,
and
hopes
you
'll
forgive
him
.
<EOS>
Then
Mrs
Sliverstone
sits
down
beside
him
,
and
taking
his
hand
in
hers
,
tells
you
how
that
Mr
Sliverstone
has
been
shut
up
there
ever
since
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
(
it
is
by
this
time
twelve
at
noon
,
)
and
how
she
knows
it
can
not
be
good
for
his
health
,
and
is
very
uneasy
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Unto
this
Mr
Sliverstone
replies
firmly
,
that
"
It
must
be
done
;
"
which
agonizes
Mrs
Sliverstone
still
more
,
and
she
goes
on
to
tell
you
that
such
were
Mr
Sliverstone
's
labours
last
week
---
what
with
the
buryings
,
marryings
,
churchings
,
christenings
,
and
all
together
,
---
that
when
he
was
going
up
the
pulpit
stairs
on
Sunday
evening
,
he
was
obliged
to
hold
on
by
the
rails
,
or
he
would
certainly
have
fallen
over
into
his
own
pew
.
<EOS>
Mr
Sliverstone
,
who
has
been
listening
and
smiling
meekly
,
says
,
"
Not
quite
so
bad
as
that
,
not
quite
so
bad
!
"
<EOS>
he
admits
though
,
on
cross
-
examination
,
that
he
WAS
very
near
falling
upon
the
verger
who
was
following
him
up
to
bolt
the
door
;
but
adds
,
that
it
was
his
duty
as
a
Christian
to
fall
upon
him
,
if
need
were
,
and
that
he
,
Mr
Sliverstone
,
and
(
possibly
the
verger
too
)
ought
to
glory
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
This
sentiment
communicates
new
impulse
to
Mrs
Sliverstone
,
who
launches
into
new
praises
of
Mr
Sliverstone
's
worth
and
excellence
,
to
which
he
listens
in
the
same
meek
silence
,
save
when
he
puts
in
a
word
of
self
-
denial
relative
to
some
question
of
fact
,
as
---
"
Not
seventy
-
two
christenings
that
week
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Only
seventy
-
one
,
only
seventy
-
one
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
length
his
lady
has
quite
concluded
,
and
then
he
says
,
Why
should
he
repine
,
why
should
he
give
way
,
why
should
he
suffer
his
heart
to
sink
within
him
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
he
alone
who
toils
and
suffers
?
 
<EOS>
What
has
she
gone
through
,
he
should
like
to
know
?
 
<EOS>
What
does
she
go
through
every
day
for
him
and
for
society
?
  
<EOS>
With
such
an
exordium
Mr
Sliverstone
launches
out
into
glowing
praises
of
the
conduct
of
Mrs
Sliverstone
in
the
production
of
eight
young
children
,
and
the
subsequent
rearing
and
fostering
of
the
same
;
and
thus
the
husband
magnifies
the
wife
,
and
the
wife
the
husband
.
  
<EOS>
This
would
be
well
enough
if
Mr
and
Mrs
Sliverstone
kept
it
to
themselves
,
or
even
to
themselves
and
a
friend
or
two
;
but
they
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
hearers
they
have
,
the
more
egotistical
the
couple
become
,
and
the
more
anxious
they
are
to
make
believers
in
their
merits
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
this
is
the
worst
kind
of
egotism
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
not
even
the
poor
excuse
of
being
spontaneous
,
but
is
the
result
of
a
deliberate
system
and
malice
aforethought
.
 
<EOS>
Mere
empty
-
headed
conceit
excites
our
pity
,
but
ostentatious
hypocrisy
awakens
our
disgust
.
    
<EOS>
The
Couple
<EOS>
Who
Coddle
Themselves
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Merrywinkle
's
maiden
name
was
Chopper
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
the
only
child
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Chopper
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
died
when
she
was
,
as
the
play
-
books
express
it
,
"
yet
an
infant
;
"
and
so
old
Mrs
Chopper
,
when
her
daughter
married
,
made
the
house
of
her
son
-
in
-
law
her
home
from
that
time
henceforth
,
and
set
up
her
staff
of
rest
with
Mr
and
Mrs
Merrywinkle
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Merrywinkle
are
a
couple
who
coddle
themselves
;
and
the
venerable
Mrs
Chopper
is
an
aider
and
abettor
in
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Merrywinkle
is
a
rather
lean
and
long
-
necked
gentleman
,
middle
-
aged
and
middle
-
sized
,
and
usually
troubled
with
a
cold
in
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Merrywinkle
is
a
delicate
-
looking
lady
,
with
very
light
hair
,
and
is
exceedingly
subject
to
the
same
unpleasant
disorder
.
<EOS>
The
venerable
Mrs
Chopper
---
who
is
strictly
entitled
to
the
appellation
,
her
daughter
not
being
very
young
,
otherwise
than
by
courtesy
,
at
the
time
of
her
marriage
,
which
was
some
years
ago
---
is
a
mysterious
old
lady
who
lurks
behind
a
pair
of
spectacles
,
and
is
afflicted
with
a
chronic
disease
,
respecting
which
she
has
taken
a
vast
deal
of
medical
advice
,
and
referred
to
a
vast
number
of
medical
books
,
without
meeting
any
definition
of
symptoms
that
at
all
suits
her
,
or
enables
her
to
say
,
"
That
's
my
complaint
.
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
absence
of
authentic
information
upon
the
subject
of
this
complaint
would
seem
to
be
Mrs
Chopper
's
greatest
ill
,
as
in
all
other
respects
she
is
an
uncommonly
hale
and
hearty
gentlewoman
.
  
<EOS>
Both
Mr
and
Mrs
Chopper
wear
an
extraordinary
quantity
of
flannel
,
and
have
a
habit
of
putting
their
feet
in
hot
water
to
an
unnatural
extent
.
 
<EOS>
They
likewise
indulge
in
chamomile
tea
and
such
-
like
compounds
,
and
rub
themselves
on
the
slightest
provocation
with
camphorated
spirits
and
other
lotions
applicable
to
mumps
,
sore
-
throat
,
rheumatism
,
or
lumbago
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Merrywinkle
's
leaving
home
to
go
to
business
on
a
damp
or
<EOS>
wet
morning
is
a
very
elaborate
affair
.
 
<EOS>
He
puts
on
wash
-
leather
socks
over
his
stockings
,
and
India
-
rubber
shoes
above
his
boots
,
and
wears
under
his
waistcoat
a
cuirass
of
hare
-
skin
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
these
precautions
,
he
winds
a
thick
shawl
round
his
throat
,
and
blocks
up
his
mouth
with
a
large
silk
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
accoutred
,
and
furnished
besides
with
a
great
-
coat
and
umbrella
,
he
braves
the
dangers
of
the
streets
;
travelling
in
severe
weather
at
a
gentle
trot
,
the
better
to
preserve
the
circulation
,
and
bringing
his
mouth
to
the
surface
to
take
breath
,
but
very
seldom
,
and
with
the
utmost
caution
.
 
<EOS>
His
office
-
door
opened
,
he
shoots
past
his
clerk
at
the
same
pace
,
and
diving
into
his
own
private
room
,
closes
the
door
,
examines
the
window
-
fastenings
,
and
gradually
unrobes
himself
:
 
hanging
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
on
the
fender
to
air
,
and
determining
to
write
to
the
newspapers
about
the
fog
,
which
,
he
says
,
"
has
really
got
to
that
pitch
that
it
is
quite
unbearable
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
this
last
opinion
Mrs
Merrywinkle
and
her
respected
mother
fully
concur
;
for
though
not
present
,
their
thoughts
and
tongues
are
occupied
with
the
same
subject
,
which
is
their
constant
theme
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
If
anybody
happens
to
call
,
Mrs
Merrywinkle
opines
that
they
must
assuredly
be
mad
,
and
her
first
salutation
is
,
"
Why
,
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
can
bring
you
out
in
such
weather
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
you
MUST
catch
your
death
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
This
assurance
is
corroborated
by
Mrs
Chopper
,
who
adds
,
in
further
confirmation
,
a
dismal
legend
concerning
an
individual
of
her
acquaintance
who
,
making
a
call
under
precisely
parallel
circumstances
,
and
being
then
in
the
best
health
and
spirits
,
expired
in
forty
-
eight
hours
afterwards
,
of
a
complication
of
inflammatory
disorders
.
 
<EOS>
The
visitor
,
rendered
not
altogether
comfortable
perhaps
by
this
and
other
precedents
,
inquires
very
affectionately
after
Mr
Merrywinkle
,
but
by
so
doing
brings
about
no
change
of
the
subject
;
for
Mr
Merrywinkle
's
name
is
inseparably
connected
with
his
complaints
,
and
his
complaints
are
inseparably
connected
with
Mrs
Merrywinkle
's
;
and
when
these
are
done
with
,
Mrs
Chopper
,
who
has
been
biding
her
time
,
<EOS>
cuts
in
with
the
chronic
disorder
---
a
subject
upon
which
the
amiable
old
lady
never
leaves
off
speaking
until
she
is
left
alone
,
and
very
often
not
then
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mr
Merrywinkle
comes
home
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
received
by
Mrs
Merrywinkle
and
Mrs
Chopper
,
who
,
on
his
remarking
that
he
thinks
his
feet
are
damp
,
turn
pale
as
ashes
and
drag
him
up
-
stairs
,
imploring
him
to
have
them
rubbed
directly
with
a
dry
coarse
towel
.
<EOS>
Rubbed
they
are
,
one
by
Mrs
Merrywinkle
and
one
by
Mrs
Chopper
,
until
the
friction
causes
Mr
Merrywinkle
to
make
horrible
faces
,
and
look
as
if
he
had
been
smelling
very
powerful
onions
;
when
they
desist
,
and
the
patient
,
provided
for
his
better
security
with
thick
worsted
stockings
and
list
slippers
,
is
borne
down
-
stairs
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
the
dinner
is
always
a
good
one
,
the
appetites
of
the
diners
being
delicate
,
and
requiring
a
little
of
what
Mrs
Merrywinkle
calls
"
tittivation
;
"
the
secret
of
which
is
understood
to
lie
in
good
cookery
and
tasteful
spices
,
and
which
process
is
so
successfully
performed
in
the
present
instance
,
that
both
Mr
and
Mrs
Merrywinkle
eat
a
remarkably
good
dinner
,
and
even
the
afflicted
Mrs
Chopper
wields
her
knife
and
fork
with
much
of
the
spirit
and
elasticity
of
youth
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Merrywinkle
,
in
his
desire
to
gratify
his
appetite
,
is
not
unmindful
of
his
health
,
for
he
has
a
bottle
of
carbonate
of
soda
with
which
to
qualify
his
porter
,
and
a
little
pair
of
scales
in
which
to
weigh
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
in
his
anxiety
to
take
care
of
his
body
is
he
unmindful
of
the
welfare
of
his
immortal
part
,
as
he
always
prays
that
for
what
he
is
going
to
receive
he
may
be
made
truly
thankful
;
and
in
order
that
he
may
be
as
thankful
as
possible
,
eats
and
drinks
to
the
utmost
.
  
<EOS>
Either
from
eating
and
drinking
so
much
,
or
from
being
the
victim
of
this
constitutional
infirmity
,
among
others
,
Mr
Merrywinkle
,
after
two
or
three
glasses
of
wine
,
falls
fast
asleep
;
and
he
has
scarcely
closed
his
eyes
,
when
Mrs
Merrywinkle
and
Mrs
Chopper
fall
asleep
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
on
awakening
at
tea
-
time
that
their
most
alarming
symptoms
prevail
;
for
then
Mr
Merrywinkle
feels
as
if
his
temples
were
tightly
bound
round
with
the
chain
of
the
street
-
door
,
and
Mrs
Merrywinkle
as
if
she
had
made
a
hearty
dinner
of
half
-
hundredweights
,
and
Mrs
Chopper
as
if
cold
water
were
running
down
her
back
,
and
oyster
-
knives
with
sharp
points
were
plunging
of
their
own
accord
into
her
ribs
.
 
<EOS>
Symptoms
like
these
are
enough
to
make
people
peevish
,
and
no
wonder
that
they
remain
so
until
supper
-
time
,
doing
little
more
than
doze
and
complain
,
unless
Mr
Merrywinkle
calls
out
very
loudly
to
a
servant
"
to
keep
that
draught
out
,
"
or
rushes
into
the
passage
to
flourish
his
fist
in
the
countenance
of
the
twopenny
-
postman
,
for
daring
to
give
such
a
knock
as
he
had
just
performed
at
the
door
of
a
private
gentleman
with
nerves
.
  
<EOS>
Supper
,
coming
after
dinner
,
should
consist
of
some
gentle
provocative
;
and
therefore
the
tittivating
art
is
again
in
requisition
,
and
again
---
done
honour
to
by
Mr
and
Mrs
Merrywinkle
,
still
comforted
and
abetted
by
Mrs
Chopper
.
 
<EOS>
After
supper
,
it
is
ten
to
one
but
the
last
-
named
old
lady
becomes
worse
,
and
is
led
off
to
bed
with
the
chronic
complaint
in
full
vigour
.
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Merrywinkle
,
having
administered
to
her
a
warm
cordial
,
which
is
something
of
the
strongest
,
then
repair
to
their
own
room
,
where
Mr
Merrywinkle
,
with
his
legs
and
feet
in
hot
water
,
superintends
the
mulling
of
some
wine
which
he
is
to
drink
at
the
very
moment
he
plunges
into
bed
,
while
Mrs
Merrywinkle
,
in
garments
whose
nature
is
unknown
to
and
unimagined
by
all
but
married
men
,
takes
four
small
pills
with
a
spasmodic
look
between
each
,
and
finally
comes
to
something
hot
and
fragrant
out
of
another
little
saucepan
,
which
serves
as
her
composing
-
draught
for
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
another
kind
of
couple
who
coddle
themselves
,
and
who
do
so
at
a
cheaper
rate
and
on
more
spare
diet
,
because
they
are
niggardly
and
parsimonious
;
for
which
reason
they
are
kind
enough
to
coddle
their
visitors
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
unnecessary
to
describe
them
,
for
our
readers
may
rest
assured
of
the
accuracy
of
these
general
principles
:
---
that
all
couples
who
coddle
themselves
are
selfish
and
slothful
,
---
that
they
charge
upon
every
wind
that
blows
,
every
rain
that
falls
,
and
every
vapour
that
hangs
in
the
air
,
the
evils
which
arise
from
their
own
imprudence
or
the
gloom
which
is
engendered
in
their
own
tempers
,
---
and
that
all
men
and
women
,
in
couples
or
otherwise
,
who
fall
into
exclusive
habits
of
self
-
indulgence
,
and
forget
their
natural
sympathy
and
close
connexion
with
everybody
and
everything
in
the
world
around
them
,
not
only
neglect
the
first
duty
of
life
,
but
,
by
a
happy
retributive
justice
,
deprive
themselves
of
its
truest
and
best
enjoyment
.
    
<EOS>
The
Old
Couple
    
<EOS>
They
are
grandfather
and
grandmother
to
a
dozen
grown
people
and
have
great
-
grandchildren
besides
;
their
bodies
are
bent
,
their
hair
is
grey
,
their
step
tottering
and
infirm
.
 
<EOS>
Is
this
the
lightsome
pair
whose
wedding
was
so
merry
,
and
have
the
young
couple
indeed
grown
old
so
soon
!
  
<EOS>
It
seems
but
yesterday
---
<EOS>
and
yet
what
a
host
of
cares
and
griefs
are
crowded
into
the
intervening
time
which
,
reckoned
by
them
,
lengthens
out
into
a
century
!
 
<EOS>
How
many
new
associations
have
wreathed
themselves
about
their
hearts
since
then
!
 
<EOS>
The
old
time
is
gone
,
and
a
new
time
has
come
for
others
---
not
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
but
<EOS>
the
rusting
link
that
feebly
joins
the
two
,
and
is
silently
loosening
its
hold
and
dropping
asunder
.
  
<EOS>
It
seems
but
yesterday
---
and
yet
three
of
their
children
have
sunk
into
the
grave
,
and
the
tree
that
shades
it
has
grown
quite
old
.
<EOS>
One
was
an
infant
---
they
wept
for
him
;
the
next
a
girl
,
a
slight
young
thing
too
delicate
for
earth
---
her
loss
was
hard
indeed
to
bear
.
 
<EOS>
The
third
,
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
the
worst
of
all
,
but
even
that
grief
is
softened
now
.
  
<EOS>
It
seems
but
yesterday
---
<EOS>
and
yet
how
the
gay
and
laughing
faces
of
that
bright
morning
have
changed
and
vanished
from
above
ground
!
<EOS>
Faint
likenesses
of
some
remain
about
them
yet
,
but
they
are
very
faint
and
scarcely
to
be
traced
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
are
only
seen
in
dreams
,
and
even
they
are
unlike
what
they
were
,
in
eyes
<EOS>
so
old
and
dim
.
  
<EOS>
One
or
two
dresses
from
the
bridal
wardrobe
are
yet
preserved
.
<EOS>
They
are
of
a
quaint
and
antique
fashion
,
and
seldom
seen
except
in
pictures
.
 
<EOS>
White
has
turned
yellow
,
and
brighter
hues
have
faded
.
<EOS>
Do
you
wonder
,
child
?
 
<EOS>
The
wrinkled
face
was
once
as
smooth
as
yours
,
the
eyes
as
bright
,
the
shrivelled
skin
as
fair
and
delicate
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
work
of
hands
that
have
been
dust
these
many
years
.
  
<EOS>
Where
are
the
fairy
lovers
of
that
happy
day
whose
annual
return
comes
upon
the
old
man
and
his
wife
,
like
the
echo
of
some
village
bell
which
has
long
been
silent
?
 
<EOS>
Let
<EOS>
yonder
peevish
bachelor
,
racked
by
rheumatic
pains
,
and
quarrelling
with
the
world
,
let
him
answer
to
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
He
recollects
something
of
a
favourite
playmate
;
her
name
was
Lucy
---
so
they
tell
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
sure
whether
she
was
married
,
or
went
abroad
,
or
died
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
long
while
ago
,
and
he
do
n't
remember
.
  
<EOS>
Is
nothing
as
it
used
to
be
;
does
no
one
feel
,
or
think
,
or
act
,
as
in
days
of
yore
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
an
aged
woman
who
once
lived
servant
with
the
old
lady
's
father
,
and
is
sheltered
in
an
alms
-
house
not
far
off
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
still
attached
to
the
family
,
and
loves
them
all
;
she
nursed
the
children
in
her
lap
,
and
tended
in
their
sickness
those
who
are
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Her
old
mistress
has
still
something
of
youth
in
her
eyes
;
the
young
ladies
are
like
what
she
was
but
not
quite
so
handsome
,
nor
are
the
gentlemen
as
stately
as
Mr
Harvey
used
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
seen
a
great
deal
of
trouble
;
her
husband
and
her
son
died
long
ago
;
but
she
has
got
over
that
,
and
is
happy
now
---
quite
happy
.
  
<EOS>
If
ever
her
attachment
to
her
old
protectors
were
disturbed
by
fresher
cares
and
hopes
,
it
has
long
since
resumed
its
former
current
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
filled
the
void
in
the
poor
creature
's
heart
,
and
replaced
the
love
of
kindred
.
 
<EOS>
Death
has
not
left
her
alone
,
and
this
,
with
a
roof
above
her
head
,
and
a
warm
hearth
to
sit
by
,
makes
her
cheerful
and
contented
.
 
<EOS>
Does
she
remember
the
marriage
of
great
-
grandmamma
?
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
that
she
does
,
as
well
---
as
if
it
was
only
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
n't
think
it
to
look
at
her
now
,
and
perhaps
she
ought
not
to
say
so
of
herself
,
but
she
was
as
smart
a
young
girl
then
as
you
'd
wish
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
She
recollects
she
took
a
friend
of
hers
up
-
stairs
to
see
Miss
Emma
dressed
for
church
;
her
name
was
---
ah
!
<EOS>
she
forgets
the
name
,
but
she
remembers
that
she
was
a
very
pretty
girl
,
and
that
she
married
not
long
afterwards
,
and
lived
---
<EOS>
it
has
quite
passed
out
of
her
mind
where
she
lived
,
but
she
knows
she
had
a
bad
husband
who
used
her
ill
,
and
that
she
died
in
Lambeth
work
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
,
in
Lambeth
workhouse
!
  
<EOS>
And
the
old
couple
---
have
they
no
comfort
or
enjoyment
of
existence
?
 
<EOS>
See
them
among
their
grandchildren
and
great
-
grandchildren
;
how
garrulous
they
are
,
how
they
compare
one
with
another
,
and
insist
on
likenesses
which
no
one
else
can
see
;
how
gently
the
old
lady
lectures
the
girls
on
points
of
breeding
and
decorum
,
and
points
the
moral
by
anecdotes
of
herself
in
her
young
days
---
how
the
old
gentleman
chuckles
over
boyish
feats
and
roguish
tricks
,
and
tells
long
stories
of
a
"
barring
-
out
"
achieved
at
the
school
he
went
to
:
 
which
was
very
wrong
,
he
tells
the
boys
,
and
never
to
be
imitated
of
course
,
but
which
he
can
not
help
letting
them
know
was
very
pleasant
too
---
especially
when
he
kissed
the
master
's
niece
.
 
<EOS>
This
last
,
however
,
is
a
point
on
which
the
old
lady
is
very
tender
,
for
she
considers
it
a
shocking
and
indelicate
thing
to
talk
about
,
and
always
says
so
whenever
it
is
mentioned
,
never
failing
to
observe
that
he
ought
to
be
very
penitent
for
having
been
so
sinful
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
old
gentleman
gets
no
further
,
and
what
the
schoolmaster
's
niece
said
afterwards
(
which
he
is
always
going
to
tell
)
is
lost
to
posterity
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
is
eighty
years
old
,
to
-
day
---
"
Eighty
years
old
,
Crofts
,
and
never
had
a
headache
,
"
he
tells
the
barber
who
shaves
him
(
the
barber
being
a
young
fellow
,
and
very
subject
to
that
complaint
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
great
age
,
Crofts
,
"
says
the
old
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
it
's
sich
<EOS>
a
wery
great
age
<EOS>
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
barber
.
 
<EOS>
"
Crofts
,
"
rejoins
the
old
gentleman
,
"
you
're
talking
nonsense
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Eighty
<EOS>
not
a
great
age
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
wery
great
age
,
Sir
,
for
a
gentleman
to
be
as
healthy
and
active
as
you
are
,
"
returns
the
barber
;
"
but
my
grandfather
,
Sir
,
he
was
ninety
-
four
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
that
,
Crofts
?
"
says
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
indeed
,
Sir
,
"
retorts
the
barber
,
"
and
as
wiggerous
as
Julius
Caesar
,
my
grandfather
was
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
muses
a
little
time
,
and
then
says
,
"
What
did
he
die
of
,
Crofts
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
died
accidentally
,
Sir
,
"
returns
the
barber
;
"
he
did
n't
mean
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
He
always
would
go
a
running
about
the
streets
---
walking
never
satisfied
HIS
spirit
---
and
he
run
against
a
post
and
died
of
a
hurt
in
his
chest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
says
no
more
until
the
shaving
is
concluded
,
and
then
he
gives
Crofts
half
-
a
-
crown
to
drink
his
health
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
little
doubtful
of
the
barber
's
veracity
afterwards
,
and
telling
the
anecdote
to
the
old
lady
,
affects
to
make
very
light
of
it
---
though
to
be
sure
(
he
adds
)
<EOS>
there
was
old
Parr
,
and
in
some
parts
of
England
,
ninety
-
five
or
so
is
a
common
age
,
quite
a
common
age
.
  
<EOS>
This
morning
the
old
couple
are
cheerful
but
serious
,
recalling
old
times
as
well
as
they
can
remember
them
,
and
dwelling
upon
many
passages
in
their
past
lives
which
the
day
brings
to
mind
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
lady
reads
aloud
,
in
a
tremulous
voice
,
out
of
a
great
Bible
,
and
the
old
gentleman
with
his
hand
to
his
ear
,
listens
with
profound
respect
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
book
is
closed
,
they
sit
silent
for
a
short
space
,
and
afterwards
resume
their
conversation
,
with
a
reference
perhaps
to
their
dead
children
,
as
a
subject
not
unsuited
to
that
they
have
just
left
.
 
<EOS>
By
degrees
they
are
led
to
consider
which
of
those
who
survive
are
the
most
like
those
dearly
-
remembered
objects
,
and
so
they
fall
into
a
less
solemn
strain
,
and
become
cheerful
again
.
  
<EOS>
How
many
people
in
all
,
grandchildren
,
great
-
grandchildren
,
and
one
or
two
intimate
friends
of
the
family
,
dine
together
to
-
day
at
the
eldest
son
's
to
congratulate
the
old
couple
,
and
wish
them
many
happy
returns
,
is
a
calculation
beyond
our
powers
;
but
this
we
know
,
that
the
old
couple
no
sooner
present
themselves
,
very
sprucely
and
carefully
attired
,
than
there
is
a
violent
shouting
and
rushing
forward
of
the
younger
branches
with
all
manner
of
presents
,
such
as
pocket
-
books
,
pencil
-
cases
,
pen
-
wipers
,
watch
-
papers
,
pin
-
cushions
,
sleeve
-
buckles
,
worked
-
slippers
,
watch
-
guards
,
and
even
a
nutmeg
-
grater
:
 
the
latter
article
being
presented
by
a
very
chubby
and
very
little
boy
,
who
exhibits
it
in
great
triumph
as
an
extraordinary
variety
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
couple
's
emotion
at
these
tokens
of
remembrance
occasions
quite
a
pathetic
scene
,
of
which
the
chief
ingredients
are
a
vast
quantity
of
kissing
and
hugging
,
and
repeated
wipings
of
small
eyes
and
noses
with
small
square
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
,
which
do
n't
come
at
all
easily
out
of
small
pockets
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
peevish
bachelor
is
moved
,
and
he
says
,
as
he
presents
the
old
gentleman
with
a
queer
sort
of
antique
ring
from
his
own
finger
,
that
he
'll
be
de'ed
if
he
does
n't
think
he
looks
younger
than
he
did
ten
years
ago
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
great
time
is
after
dinner
,
when
the
dessert
and
wine
are
on
the
table
,
which
is
pushed
back
to
make
plenty
of
room
,
and
they
are
all
gathered
in
a
large
circle
round
the
fire
,
for
it
is
then
---
the
glasses
being
filled
,
and
everybody
ready
to
drink
the
toast
---
that
two
great
-
grandchildren
rush
out
at
a
given
signal
,
and
presently
return
,
dragging
in
old
Jane
Adams
leaning
upon
her
crutched
stick
,
and
trembling
with
age
and
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
Who
so
popular
as
poor
old
Jane
,
nurse
and
story
-
teller
in
ordinary
to
two
generations
;
and
who
so
happy
as
she
,
striving
to
bend
her
stiff
limbs
into
a
curtsey
,
while
tears
of
pleasure
steal
down
her
withered
cheeks
!
  
<EOS>
The
old
couple
sit
side
by
side
,
and
the
old
time
seems
like
yesterday
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
back
upon
the
path
they
have
travelled
,
its
dust
and
ashes
disappear
;
the
flowers
that
withered
long
ago
,
show
brightly
again
upon
its
borders
,
and
they

<EOS>
Conclusion
    
<EOS>
We
have
taken
for
the
subjects
of
the
foregoing
moral
essays
,
twelve
samples
of
married
couples
,
carefully
selected
from
a
large
stock
on
hand
,
open
to
the
inspection
of
all
comers
.
 
<EOS>
These
samples
are
intended
for
the
benefit
of
the
rising
generation
of
both
sexes
,
and
,
for
their
more
easy
and
pleasant
information
,
have
been
separately
ticketed
and
labelled
in
the
manner
they
have
seen
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
purposely
excluded
from
consideration
the
couple
in
which
the
lady
reigns
paramount
and
supreme
,
holding
such
cases
to
be
of
a
very
unnatural
kind
,
and
like
hideous
births
and
other
monstrous
deformities
,
only
to
be
discreetly
and
sparingly
exhibited
.
  
<EOS>
And
here
our
self
-
imposed
task
would
have
ended
,
but
that
to
those
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
are
yet
revolving
singly
round
the
church
,
awaiting
the
advent
of
that
time
when
the
mysterious
laws
of
attraction
shall
draw
them
towards
it
in
couples
<EOS>
,
we
are
desirous
of
addressing
a
few
last
words
.
  
<EOS>
Before
marriage
and
afterwards
,
let
them
learn
to
centre
all
their
hopes
of
real
and
lasting
happiness
in
their
own
fireside
;
let
them
cherish
the
faith
that
in
home
,
and
all
the
English
virtues
which
the
love
of
home
engenders
,
lies
the
only
true
source
of
domestic
felicity
;
let
them
believe
that
round
the
household
gods
,
contentment
and
tranquillity
cluster
in
their
gentlest
and
most
graceful
forms
;
and
that
many
weary
hunters
of
happiness
through
the
noisy
world
,
have
learnt
this
truth
too
late
,
and
found
a
cheerful
spirit
and
a
quiet
mind
only
at
home
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
How
much
may
depend
on
the
education
of
daughters
and
the
conduct
of
mothers
;
how
much
of
the
brightest
part
of
our
old
national
character
may
be
perpetuated
by
their
wisdom
or
frittered
away
by
their
folly
---
how
much
of
it
may
have
been
lost
already
,
and
how
much
more
in
danger
of
vanishing
every
day
---
are
questions
too
weighty
for
discussion
here
,
but
well
deserving
a
little
serious
consideration
from
all
young
couples
nevertheless
.
  
<EOS>
To
that
one
young
couple
on
whose
bright
destiny
the
thoughts
of
nations
are
fixed
,
may
the
youth
of
England
look
,
and
not
in
vain
,
for
an
example
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
one
young
couple
,
blessed
and
favoured
as
they
are
,
may
they
learn
that
even
the
glare
and
glitter
of
a
court
,
the
splendour
of
a
palace
,
and
the
pomp
and
glory
of
a
throne
,
yield
in
their
power
of
conferring
happiness
,
to
domestic
worth
and
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
one
young
couple
may
they
learn
that
the
crown
of
a
great
empire
,
costly
and
jewelled
though
it
be
,
gives
place
in
the
estimation
of
a
Queen
to
the
plain
gold
ring
that
links
her
woman
's
nature
to
that
of
tens
of
thousands
of
her
humble
subjects
,
and
guards
in
her
woman
's
heart
one
secret
store
of
tenderness
,
whose
proudest
boast
shall
be
that
it
knows
no
Royalty
save
Nature
's
own
,
and
no
pride
of
birth
but
being
the
child
of
heaven
!
  
<EOS>
So
shall
the
highest
young
couple
in
the
land
for
once
hear
the
truth
,
when
men
throw
up
their
caps
,
and
cry
with
loving
shouts
---
  
God
Bless
Them
.

The
Mudfog
<EOS>
And
Other
Sketches
 
<EOS>
Public
Life
Of
Mr
Tulrumble
---
<EOS>
Once
Mayor
Of
Mudfog
    
Mudfog
is
a
pleasant
town
---
a
remarkably
pleasant
town
---
situated
in
a
charming
hollow
by
the
side
of
a
river
,
from
which
river
,
Mudfog
derives
an
agreeable
scent
of
pitch
,
tar
,
coals
,
and
rope
-
yarn
,
a
roving
population
in
oilskin
hats
,
a
pretty
steady
influx
of
drunken
bargemen
,
and
a
great
many
other
maritime
advantages
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
good
deal
of
water
about
Mudfog
,
and
yet
it
is
not
exactly
the
sort
of
town
for
a
watering
-
place
,
either
.
 
<EOS>
Water
is
a
perverse
sort
of
element
at
the
best
of
times
,
and
in
Mudfog
it
is
particularly
so
.
 
<EOS>
In
winter
,
it
comes
oozing
down
the
streets
and
tumbling
over
the
fields
,
---
<EOS>
nay
,
rushes
into
the
very
cellars
and
kitchens
of
the
houses
,
with
a
lavish
prodigality
that
might
well
be
dispensed
with
;
but
in
the
hot
summer
weather
it
WILL
dry
up
,
and
turn
green
:
 
and
,
although
green
is
a
very
good
colour
in
its
way
,
especially
in
grass
,
still
it
certainly
is
not
becoming
to
water
;
and
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
beauty
of
Mudfog
is
rather
impaired
,
even
by
this
trifling
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
Mudfog
is
a
healthy
place
---
very
healthy
;
---
damp
,
perhaps
,
but
none
the
worse
for
that
.
<EOS>
It
's
quite
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
damp
is
unwholesome
:
 
plants
thrive
best
in
damp
situations
,
and
why
should
n't
men
?
 
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
of
Mudfog
are
unanimous
in
asserting
that
there
exists
not
a
finer
race
of
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
;
here
we
have
an
indisputable
and
veracious
contradiction
of
the
vulgar
error
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
admitting
Mudfog
to
be
damp
,
we
distinctly
state
that
it
is
salubrious
.
  
<EOS>
The
town
of
Mudfog
is
extremely
picturesque
.
 
<EOS>
Limehouse
and
Ratcliff
Highway
are
both
something
like
it
,
but
they
give
you
a
very
faint
idea
of
Mudfog
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
a
great
many
more
public
-
houses
in
Mudfog
---
more
than
in
Ratcliff
Highway
and
Limehouse
put
together
.
 
<EOS>
The
public
buildings
,
too
,
are
very
imposing
.
 
<EOS>
We
consider
the
town
-
hall
one
of
the
finest
specimens
of
shed
architecture
,
extant
:
 
<EOS>
it
is
a
combination
of
the
pig
-
sty
and
tea
-
garden
-
box
orders
;
and
the
simplicity
of
its
design
is
of
surpassing
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
The
idea
of
placing
a
large
window
on
one
side
of
the
door
,
and
a
small
one
on
the
other
,
is
particularly
happy
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
fine
old
Doric
beauty
,
too
,
about
the
padlock
and
scraper
,
which
is
strictly
in
keeping
with
the
general
effect
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
room
do
the
mayor
and
corporation
of
Mudfog
assemble
together
in
solemn
council
for
the
public
weal
.
 
<EOS>
Seated
on
the
massive
wooden
benches
,
which
,
with
the
table
in
the
centre
,
form
the
only
furniture
of
the
whitewashed
apartment
,
the
sage
men
of
Mudfog
spend
hour
after
hour
in
grave
deliberation
.
 
<EOS>
Here
they
settle
at
what
hour
of
the
night
the
public
-
houses
shall
be
closed
,
at
what
hour
of
the
morning
they
shall
be
permitted
to
open
,
how
soon
it
shall
be
lawful
for
people
to
eat
their
dinner
on
church
-
days
,
and
other
great
political
questions
;
and
sometimes
,
long
after
silence
has
fallen
on
the
town
,
and
the
distant
lights
from
the
shops
and
houses
have
ceased
to
twinkle
,
like
far
-
off
stars
,
to
the
sight
of
the
boatmen
on
the
river
,
the
illumination
in
the
two
unequal
-
sized
windows
of
the
town
-
hall
,
warns
the
inhabitants
of
Mudfog
that
its
little
body
of
legislators
,
like
a
larger
and
better
-
known
body
of
the
same
genus
,
a
great
deal
more
noisy
,
and
not
a
whit
more
profound
,
are
patriotically
dozing
away
in
company
,
far
into
the
night
,
for
their
country
's
good
.
  
<EOS>
Among
this
knot
of
sage
and
learned
men
,
no
one
was
so
eminently
distinguished
,
during
many
years
,
for
the
quiet
modesty
of
his
appearance
and
demeanour
,
as
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
the
well
-
known
coal
-
dealer
.
 
<EOS>
However
exciting
the
subject
of
discussion
,
however
animated
the
tone
of
the
debate
,
or
however
warm
the
personalities
exchanged
,
<EOS>
(
and
even
in
Mudfog
we
get
personal
sometimes
,
)
<EOS>
Nicholas
Tulrumble
was
always
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
To
say
truth
,
Nicholas
,
being
an
industrious
man
,
and
always
up
betimes
,
was
apt
to
fall
asleep
when
a
debate
began
,
and
to
remain
asleep
till
it
was
over
,
when
he
would
wake
up
very
much
refreshed
,
and
give
his
vote
with
the
greatest
complacency
.
 
<EOS>
The
fact
was
,
that
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
knowing
that
everybody
there
had
made
up
his
mind
beforehand
,
considered
the
talking
as
just
a
long
botheration
about
nothing
at
all
;
and
to
the
present
hour
it
remains
a
question
,
whether
,
on
this
point
at
all
events
,
Nicholas
Tulrumble
was
not
pretty
near
right
.
  
<EOS>
Time
,
which
strews
a
man
's
head
with
silver
,
sometimes
fills
his
pockets
with
gold
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
gradually
performed
one
good
office
for
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
he
was
obliging
enough
,
not
to
omit
the
other
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
began
life
in
a
wooden
tenement
of
four
feet
square
,
with
a
capital
of
two
and
ninepence
,
and
a
stock
in
trade
of
three
bushels
and
a
-
half
of
coals
,
exclusive
of
the
large
lump
which
hung
,
by
way
of
sign
-
board
,
outside
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
enlarged
the
shed
,
and
kept
a
truck
;
then
he
left
the
shed
,
and
the
truck
too
,
and
started
a
donkey
and
a
Mrs
Tulrumble
;
then
he
moved
again
and
set
up
a
cart
;
the
cart
was
soon
afterwards
exchanged
for
a
waggon
;
and
so
he
went
on
like
his
great
predecessor
Whittington
---
only
without
a
cat
for
a
partner
---
increasing
in
wealth
and
fame
,
until
at
last
he
gave
up
business
altogether
,
and
retired
with
Mrs
Tulrumble
and
family
to
Mudfog
Hall
,
which
he
had
himself
erected
,
on
something
which
he
attempted
to
delude
himself
into
the
belief
<EOS>
was
a
hill
,
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
from
the
town
of
Mudfog
.
  
<EOS>
About
this
time
,
it
began
to
be
murmured
in
Mudfog
that
Nicholas
Tulrumble
was
growing
vain
and
haughty
;
that
prosperity
and
success
had
corrupted
the
simplicity
of
his
manners
,
and
tainted
the
natural
goodness
of
his
heart
;
in
short
,
that
he
was
setting
up
for
a
public
character
,
and
a
great
gentleman
,
and
affected
to
look
down
upon
his
old
companions
with
compassion
and
contempt
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
these
reports
were
at
the
time
well
-
founded
,
or
not
,
certain
it
is
that
Mrs
Tulrumble
very
shortly
afterwards
started
a
four
-
wheel
chaise
,
driven
by
a
tall
postilion
in
a
yellow
cap
,
---
that
Mr
Tulrumble
junior
took
to
smoking
cigars
,
and
calling
the
footman
a
"
feller
,
"
---
and
that
Mr
Tulrumble
from
that
time
forth
,
was
no
more
seen
in
his
old
seat
in
the
chimney
-
corner
of
the
Lighterman
's
Arms
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
This
looked
bad
;
but
,
more
than
this
,
it
began
to
be
observed
that
Mr
Nicholas
Tulrumble
attended
the
corporation
meetings
more
frequently
than
heretofore
;
and
he
no
longer
went
to
sleep
as
he
had
done
for
so
many
years
,
but
propped
his
eyelids
open
with
his
two
forefingers
;
that
he
read
the
newspapers
by
himself
at
home
;
and
that
he
was
in
the
habit
of
indulging
abroad
in
distant
and
mysterious
allusions
to
"
masses
of
people
,
"
and
"
the
property
of
the
country
,
"
and
"
productive
power
,
"
and
"
the
monied
interest
:
"
all
of
which
denoted
and
proved
that
Nicholas
Tulrumble
was
either
mad
,
or
worse
;
and
it
puzzled
the
good
people
of
Mudfog
amazingly
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
,
about
the
middle
of
the
month
of
October
,
Mr
Tulrumble
and
family
went
up
to
London
;
the
middle
of
October
being
,
as
Mrs
Tulrumble
informed
her
acquaintance
in
Mudfog
,
the
very
height
of
the
fashionable
season
.
  
<EOS>
Somehow
or
other
,
just
about
this
time
,
despite
the
health
-
preserving
air
of
Mudfog
,
the
Mayor
died
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
most
extraordinary
circumstance
;
he
had
lived
in
Mudfog
for
eighty
-
five
years
.
 
<EOS>
The
corporation
did
n't
understand
it
at
all
;
indeed
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
one
old
gentleman
,
who
was
a
great
stickler
for
forms
,
was
dissuaded
from
proposing
a
vote
of
censure
on
such
unaccountable
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
Strange
as
it
was
,
however
,
die
he
did
,
without
taking
the
slightest
notice
of
the
corporation
;
and
the
corporation
were
imperatively
called
upon
to
elect
his
successor
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
they
met
for
the
purpose
;
and
being
very
full
of
Nicholas
Tulrumble
just
then
,
and
Nicholas
Tulrumble
being
a
very
important
man
<EOS>
,
they
elected
him
,
and
wrote
off
to
London
by
the
very
next
post
to
acquaint
Nicholas
Tulrumble
with
his
new
elevation
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
it
being
November
time
,
and
Mr
Nicholas
Tulrumble
being
in
the
capital
,
it
fell
out
that
he
was
present
at
the
Lord
Mayor
's
show
and
dinner
,
at
sight
of
the
glory
and
splendour
whereof
,
he
,
Mr
Tulrumble
,
was
greatly
mortified
,
inasmuch
as
the
reflection
would
force
itself
on
his
mind
,
that
,
had
he
been
born
in
London
instead
of
in
Mudfog
<EOS>
,
he
might
have
been
a
Lord
Mayor
too
,
and
have
patronized
the
judges
,
and
been
affable
to
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
and
friendly
with
the
Premier
,
and
coldly
condescending
to
the
Secretary
to
the
Treasury
,
and
have
dined
with
a
flag
behind
his
back
,
and
done
a
great
many
other
acts
and
deeds
which
unto
Lord
Mayors
of
London
peculiarly
appertain
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
he
thought
of
the
Lord
Mayor
,
the
more
enviable
a
personage
he
seemed
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
a
King
was
all
very
well
;
but
what
was
the
King
to
the
Lord
Mayor
!
 
<EOS>
When
the
King
made
a
speech
,
everybody
knew
it
was
somebody
else
's
writing
;
whereas
here
was
the
Lord
Mayor
,
talking
away
for
half
an
hour
-
all
out
of
his
own
head
---
amidst
the
enthusiastic
applause
of
the
whole
company
,
while
it
was
notorious
that
the
King
might
talk
to
his
parliament
till
he
was
black
in
the
face
without
getting
so
much
as
a
single
cheer
.
 
<EOS>
As
all
these
reflections
passed
through
the
mind
of
Mr
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
appeared
to
him
the
greatest
sovereign
on
the
face
of
the
earth
,
beating
the
Emperor
of
Russia
all
to
nothing
,
and
leaving
the
Great
Mogul
immeasurably
behind
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Nicholas
Tulrumble
was
pondering
over
these
things
,
and
inwardly
cursing
the
fate
which
had
pitched
his
coal
-
shed
in
Mudfog
,
when
the
letter
of
the
corporation
was
put
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
A
crimson
flush
mantled
over
his
face
as
he
read
it
,
for
visions
of
brightness
were
already
dancing
before
his
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Tulrumble
to
his
wife
,
"
they
have
elected
me
,
Mayor
of
Mudfog
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lor
-
a
-
mussy
!
"
said
Mrs
Tulrumble
:
 
<EOS>
"
why
what
's
become
of
old
Sniggs
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
late
Mr
Sniggs
,
Mrs
Tulrumble
,
"
said
Mr
Tulrumble
sharply
,
for
he
by
no
means
approved
of
the
notion
of
unceremoniously
designating
a
gentleman
who
filled
the
high
office
of
Mayor
,
as
"
Old
Sniggs
,
"
---
"
The
late
Mr
Sniggs
,
Mrs
Tulrumble
,
is
dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
communication
was
very
unexpected
;
but
Mrs
Tulrumble
only
ejaculated
"
Lor
-
a
-
mussy
!
"
<EOS>
once
again
,
as
if
a
Mayor
were
a
mere
ordinary
Christian
,
at
which
Mr
Tulrumble
frowned
gloomily
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
pity
"
tan't
in
London
,
ai
n't
it
?
"
said
Mrs
Tulrumble
,
after
a
short
pause
;
"
what
a
pity
"
tan't
in
London
,
where
you
might
have
had
a
show
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
MIGHT
have
a
show
in
Mudfog
,
if
I
thought
proper
,
I
apprehend
,
"
said
Mr
Tulrumble
mysteriously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lor
!
<EOS>
so
you
might
,
I
declare
,
"
replied
Mrs
Tulrumble
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
a
good
one
too
,
"
said
Mr
Tulrumble
.
  
<EOS>
"
Delightful
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Tulrumble
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
which
would
rather
astonish
the
ignorant
people
down
there
,
"
said
Mr
Tulrumble
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
kill
them
with
envy
,
"
said
Mrs
Tulrumble
.
  
<EOS>
So
it
was
agreed
that
his
Majesty
's
lieges
in
Mudfog
should
be
astonished
with
splendour
,
and
slaughtered
with
envy
,
and
that
such
a
show
should
take
place
as
had
never
been
seen
in
that
town
,
or
in
any
other
town
before
,
---
no
,
not
even
in
London
itself
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
very
next
day
after
the
receipt
of
the
letter
,
down
came
the
tall
postilion
in
a
post
-
chaise
,
---
not
upon
one
of
the
horses
,
but
inside
---
actually
inside
the
chaise
,
---
and
,
driving
up
to
the
very
door
of
the
town
-
hall
,
where
the
corporation
were
assembled
,
delivered
a
letter
,
written
by
the
Lord
knows
who
,
and
signed
by
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
in
which
Nicholas
said
,
all
through
four
sides
of
closely
-
written
,
gilt
-
edged
,
hot
-
pressed
,
Bath
post
letter
paper
,
that
he
responded
to
the
call
of
his
fellow
-
townsmen
with
feelings
of
heartfelt
delight
;
that
he
accepted
the
arduous
office
which
their
confidence
had
imposed
upon
him
;
that
they
would
never
find
him
shrinking
from
the
discharge
of
his
duty
;
that
he
would
endeavour
to
execute
his
functions
with
all
that
dignity
which
their
magnitude
and
importance
demanded
;
and
a
great
deal
more
to
the
same
effect
.
 
<EOS>
But
even
this
was
not
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
tall
postilion
produced
from
his
right
-
hand
top
-
boot
,
a
damp
copy
of
that
afternoon
's
number
of
the
county
paper
;
and
there
,
in
large
type
,
running
the
whole
length
of
the
very
first
column
,
was
a
long
address
from
Nicholas
Tulrumble
to
the
inhabitants
of
Mudfog
,
in
which
he
said
that
he
cheerfully
complied
with
their
requisition
,
and
,
in
short
,
as
if
to
prevent
any
mistake
about
the
matter
,
told
them
over
again
what
a
grand
fellow
he
meant
to
be
,
in
very
much
the
same
terms
as
those
in
which
he
had
already
told
them
all
about
the
matter
in
his
letter
.
  
<EOS>
The
corporation
stared
at
one
another
very
hard
at
all
this
,
and
then
looked
as
if
for
explanation
to
the
tall
postilion
,
but
as
the
tall
postilion
was
intently
contemplating
the
gold
tassel
on
the
top
of
his
yellow
cap
,
and
could
have
afforded
no
explanation
whatever
,
even
if
his
thoughts
had
been
entirely
disengaged
,
they
contented
themselves
with
coughing
very
dubiously
,
and
looking
very
grave
.
 
<EOS>
The
tall
postilion
then
delivered
another
letter
,
in
which
Nicholas
Tulrumble
informed
the
corporation
,
that
he
intended
repairing
to
the
town
-
hall
,
in
grand
state
and
gorgeous
procession
,
on
the
Monday
afternoon
next
ensuing
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
the
corporation
looked
still
more
solemn
;
but
,
as
the
epistle
wound
up
with
a
formal
invitation
to
the
whole
body
to
dine
with
the
Mayor
on
that
day
,
at
Mudfog
Hall
,
Mudfog
Hill
,
Mudfog
,
they
began
to
see
the
fun
of
the
thing
directly
,
and
sent
back
their
compliments
,
and
they
'd
be
sure
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
Now
there
happened
to
be
in
Mudfog
,
as
somehow
or
other
<EOS>
there
does
happen
to
be
,
in
almost
every
town
in
the
British
dominions
,
and
perhaps
in
foreign
dominions
too
---
we
think
it
very
likely
,
but
,
being
no
great
traveller
<EOS>
,
can
not
distinctly
say
---
there
happened
to
be
,
in
Mudfog
,
a
merry
-
tempered
,
pleasant
-
faced
,
good
-
for
-
nothing
sort
of
vagabond
,
with
an
invincible
dislike
to
manual
labour
,
and
an
unconquerable
attachment
to
strong
beer
and
spirits
,
whom
everybody
knew
,
and
nobody
,
except
his
wife
,
took
the
trouble
to
quarrel
with
,
who
inherited
from
his
ancestors
the
appellation
of
Edward
Twigger
,
and
rejoiced
in
the
SOBRIQUET
of
Bottle
-
nosed
Ned
.
<EOS>
He
was
drunk
upon
the
average
once
a
day
,
and
penitent
upon
an
equally
fair
calculation
once
a
month
;
and
when
he
was
penitent
,
he
was
invariably
in
the
very
last
stage
of
maudlin
intoxication
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
ragged
,
roving
,
roaring
kind
of
fellow
,
with
a
burly
form
,
a
sharp
wit
,
and
a
ready
head
,
and
could
turn
his
hand
to
anything
when
he
chose
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
by
no
means
opposed
to
hard
labour
on
principle
,
for
he
would
work
away
at
a
cricket
-
match
by
the
day
together
,
---
running
,
and
catching
,
and
batting
,
and
bowling
,
and
revelling
in
toil
which
would
exhaust
a
galley
-
slave
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
been
invaluable
to
a
fire
-
office
;
never
was
a
man
with
such
a
natural
taste
for
pumping
engines
,
running
up
ladders
,
and
throwing
furniture
out
of
two
-
pair
-
of
-
stairs
'
windows
:
 
nor
was
this
the
only
element
in
which
he
was
at
home
;
he
was
a
humane
society
in
himself
,
a
portable
drag
,
an
animated
life
-
preserver
,
and
had
saved
more
people
,
in
his
time
,
from
drowning
,
than
the
Plymouth
life
-
boat
,
or
Captain
Manby
's
apparatus
.
 
<EOS>
With
all
these
qualifications
,
notwithstanding
his
dissipation
,
Bottle
-
nosed
Ned
was
a
general
favourite
;
and
the
authorities
of
Mudfog
,
remembering
his
numerous
services
to
the
population
,
allowed
him
in
return
to
get
drunk
in
his
own
way
,
without
the
fear
of
stocks
,
fine
,
or
imprisonment
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
general
licence
,
and
he
showed
his
sense
of
the
compliment
by
making
the
most
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
been
thus
particular
in
describing
the
character
and
avocations
of
Bottle
-
nosed
Ned
,
because
it
enables
us
to
introduce
a
fact
politely
,
without
hauling
it
into
the
reader
's
presence
with
indecent
haste
by
the
head
and
shoulders
,
and
brings
us
very
naturally
to
relate
,
that
on
the
very
same
evening
on
which
Mr
Nicholas
Tulrumble
and
family
returned
to
Mudfog
,
Mr
Tulrumble
's
new
secretary
,
just
imported
from
London
,
with
a
pale
face
and
light
whiskers
,
thrust
his
head
down
to
the
very
bottom
of
his
neckcloth
-
tie
,
in
at
the
tap
-
room
door
of
the
Lighterman
's
Arms
,
and
inquiring
whether
one
Ned
Twigger
was
luxuriating
within
,
announced
himself
as
the
bearer
of
a
message
from
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
Esquire
,
requiring
Mr
Twigger
's
immediate
attendance
at
the
hall
,
on
private
and
particular
business
.
 
<EOS>
It
being
by
no
means
<EOS>
Mr
Twigger
's
interest
to
affront
the
Mayor
<EOS>
,
he
rose
from
the
fireplace
with
a
slight
sigh
,
and
followed
the
light
-
whiskered
secretary
through
the
dirt
and
wet
of
Mudfog
streets
,
up
to
Mudfog
Hall
,
without
further
ado
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Nicholas
Tulrumble
was
seated
in
a
small
cavern
with
a
skylight
,
which
he
called
his
library
,
sketching
out
a
plan
of
the
procession
on
a
large
sheet
of
paper
;
and
into
the
cavern
the
secretary
ushered
Ned
Twigger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Twigger
!
"
said
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
condescendingly
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
time
when
Twigger
would
have
replied
,
"
Well
,
Nick
!
"
<EOS>
but
that
was
in
the
days
of
the
truck
,
and
a
couple
of
years
before
the
donkey
;
so
,
he
only
bowed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
go
into
training
,
Twigger
,
"
said
Mr
Tulrumble
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
for
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Ned
,
with
a
stare
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
hush
,
Twigger
!
"
said
the
Mayor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shut
the
door
,
Mr
Jennings
.
 
<EOS>
Look
here
,
Twigger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
Mayor
said
this
,
he
unlocked
a
high
closet
,
and
disclosed
a
complete
suit
of
brass
armour
,
of
gigantic
dimensions
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
wear
this
next
Monday
,
Twigger
,
"
said
the
Mayor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
your
heart
and
soul
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Ned
,
"
you
might
as
well
ask
me
to
wear
a
seventy
-
four
pounder
,
or
a
cast
-
iron
boiler
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nonsense
,
Twigger
,
nonsense
!
"
said
the
Mayor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
stand
under
it
,
sir
,
"
said
Twigger
;
"
it
would
make
mashed
potatoes
of
me
,
if
I
attempted
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
,
pooh
,
Twigger
!
"
returned
the
Mayor
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
I
have
seen
it
done
with
my
own
eyes
,
in
London
,
and
the
man
was
n't
half
such
a
man
as
you
are
,
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
as
soon
have
thought
of
a
man
's
wearing
the
case
of
an
eight
-
day
clock
to
save
his
linen
,
"
said
Twigger
,
casting
a
look
of
apprehension
at
the
brass
suit
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
,
"
rejoined
the
Mayor
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
nothing
,
"
said
Mr
Jennings
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
're
used
to
it
,
"
added
Ned
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
it
by
degrees
,
"
said
the
Mayor
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
begin
with
one
piece
to
-
morrow
,
and
two
the
next
day
,
and
so
on
,
till
you
had
got
it
all
on
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jennings
,
give
Twigger
a
glass
of
rum
.
 
<EOS>
Just
try
the
breast
-
plate
,
Twigger
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
;
take
another
glass
of
rum
first
.
<EOS>
Help
me
to
lift
it
,
Mr
Jennings
.
 
<EOS>
Stand
firm
,
Twigger
!
 
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
---
it
is
n't
half
as
heavy
as
it
looks
,
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Twigger
was
a
good
strong
,
stout
fellow
;
so
,
after
a
great
deal
of
staggering
,
he
managed
to
keep
himself
up
,
under
the
breastplate
,
and
even
contrived
,
with
the
aid
of
another
glass
of
rum
,
to
walk
about
in
it
,
and
the
gauntlets
into
the
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
a
trial
of
the
helmet
,
but
was
not
equally
successful
,
inasmuch
as
he
tipped
over
instantly
,
---
an
accident
which
Mr
Tulrumble
clearly
demonstrated
to
be
occasioned
by
his
not
having
a
counteracting
weight
of
brass
on
his
legs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
wear
that
with
grace
and
propriety
on
Monday
next
,
"
said
Tulrumble
,
"
and
I
'll
make
your
fortune
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
try
what
I
can
do
,
sir
,
"
said
Twigger
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
kept
a
profound
secret
,
"
said
Tulrumble
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
sir
,
"
replied
Twigger
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
must
be
sober
,
"
said
Tulrumble
;
"
perfectly
sober
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Twigger
at
once
solemnly
pledged
himself
to
be
as
sober
as
a
judge
,
and
Nicholas
Tulrumble
was
satisfied
,
although
,
had
we
been
Nicholas
,
we
should
certainly
have
exacted
some
promise
of
a
more
specific
nature
;
inasmuch
as
,
having
attended
the
Mudfog
assizes
in
the
evening
more
than
once
,
we
can
solemnly
testify
to
having
seen
judges
with
very
strong
symptoms
of
dinner
under
their
wigs
.
<EOS>
However
,
that
's
neither
here
nor
there
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
,
and
the
day
following
,
and
the
day
after
that
,
Ned
Twigger
was
securely
locked
up
in
the
small
cavern
with
the
sky
-
light
,
hard
at
work
at
the
armour
.
 
<EOS>
With
every
additional
piece
he
could
manage
to
stand
upright
in
,
he
had
an
additional
glass
of
rum
;
and
at
last
,
after
many
partial
suffocations
,
he
contrived
to
get
on
the
whole
suit
,
and
to
stagger
up
and
down
the
room
in
it
,
like
an
intoxicated
effigy
from
Westminster
Abbey
.
  
<EOS>
Never
was
man
so
delighted
as
Nicholas
Tulrumble
;
never
was
woman
so
charmed
as
Nicholas
Tulrumble
's
wife
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
a
sight
for
the
common
people
of
Mudfog
!
 
<EOS>
A
live
man
in
brass
armour
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
they
would
go
wild
with
wonder
!
  
<EOS>
The
day
---
THE
Monday
---
arrived
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
morning
had
been
made
to
order
,
it
could
n't
have
been
better
adapted
to
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
They
never
showed
a
better
fog
in
London
on
Lord
Mayor
's
day
,
than
enwrapped
the
town
of
Mudfog
on
that
eventful
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
risen
slowly
and
surely
from
the
green
and
stagnant
water
with
the
first
light
of
morning
,
until
it
reached
a
little
above
the
lamp
-
post
tops
;
and
there
it
had
stopped
,
with
a
sleepy
,
sluggish
obstinacy
,
which
bade
defiance
to
the
sun
,
who
had
got
up
very
blood
-
shot
about
the
eyes
,
as
if
he
had
been
at
a
drinking
-
party
over
-
night
,
and
was
doing
his
day
's
work
with
the
worst
possible
grace
.
 
<EOS>
The
thick
damp
mist
hung
over
the
town
like
a
huge
gauze
curtain
.
 
<EOS>
All
was
dim
and
dismal
.
 
<EOS>
The
church
steeples
had
bidden
a
temporary
adieu
to
the
world
below
;
and
every
object
of
lesser
importance
---
houses
,
barns
,
hedges
,
trees
,
and
barges
---
had
all
taken
the
veil
.
  
<EOS>
The
church
-
clock
struck
one
.
 
<EOS>
A
cracked
trumpet
from
the
front
garden
of
Mudfog
Hall
produced
a
feeble
flourish
,
as
if
some
asthmatic
person
had
coughed
into
it
accidentally
;
the
gate
flew
open
,
and
out
came
a
gentleman
,
on
a
moist
-
sugar
coloured
charger
,
intended
to
represent
a
herald
,
but
bearing
a
much
stronger
resemblance
to
a
court
-
card
on
horseback
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
one
of
the
Circus
people
,
who
always
came
down
to
Mudfog
at
that
time
of
the
year
,
and
who
had
been
engaged
by
Nicholas
Tulrumble
expressly
for
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
horse
,
whisking
his
tail
about
,
balancing
himself
on
his
hind
-
legs
,
and
flourishing
away
with
his
fore
-
feet
,
in
a
manner
which
would
have
gone
to
the
hearts
and
souls
of
any
reasonable
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
But
a
Mudfog
crowd
never
was
a
reasonable
one
,
and
in
all
probability
never
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
scattering
the
very
fog
with
their
shouts
,
as
they
ought
most
indubitably
to
have
done
,
and
were
fully
intended
to
do
,
by
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
they
no
sooner
recognized
the
herald
,
than
they
began
to
growl
forth
the
most
unqualified
disapprobation
at
the
bare
notion
of
his
riding
like
any
other
man
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
come
out
on
his
head
indeed
,
or
jumping
through
a
hoop
,
or
flying
through
a
red
-
hot
drum
,
or
even
standing
on
one
leg
with
his
other
foot
in
his
mouth
,
they
might
have
had
something
to
say
to
him
;
but
for
a
professional
gentleman
to
sit
astride
in
the
saddle
,
with
his
feet
in
the
stirrups
,
was
rather
too
good
a
joke
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
the
herald
was
a
decided
failure
,
and
the
crowd
hooted
with
great
energy
,
as
he
pranced
ingloriously
away
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
procession
came
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
afraid
to
say
how
many
supernumeraries
there
were
,
in
striped
shirts
and
black
velvet
caps
,
to
imitate
the
London
watermen
,
or
how
many
base
imitations
of
running
-
footmen
,
or
how
many
banners
,
<EOS>
which
,
owing
to
the
heaviness
of
the
atmosphere
,
could
by
no
means
be
prevailed
on
to
display
their
inscriptions
:
 
still
less
do
we
feel
disposed
to
relate
how
the
men
who
played
the
wind
instruments
,
looking
up
into
the
sky
(
we
mean
the
fog
)
with
musical
fervour
,
walked
through
pools
of
water
and
hillocks
of
mud
,
till
they
covered
the
powdered
heads
of
the
running
-
footmen
aforesaid
with
splashes
,
that
looked
curious
,
but
not
ornamental
;
or
how
the
barrel
-
organ
performer
put
on
the
wrong
stop
,
and
played
one
tune
while
the
band
played
another
;
or
how
the
horses
,
being
used
to
the
arena
,
and
not
to
the
streets
,
would
stand
still
and
dance
,
instead
of
going
on
and
prancing
;
---
all
of
which
are
matters
which
might
be
dilated
upon
to
great
advantage
,
but
which
we
have
not
the
least
intention
of
dilating
upon
,
notwithstanding
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
was
a
grand
and
beautiful
sight
to
behold
a
corporation
in
glass
coaches
,
provided
at
the
sole
cost
and
charge
of
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
coming
rolling
along
,
like
a
funeral
out
of
mourning
,
and
to
watch
the
attempts
the
corporation
made
to
look
great
and
solemn
,
when
Nicholas
Tulrumble
himself
,
in
the
four
-
wheel
chaise
,
with
the
tall
postilion
,
rolled
out
after
them
,
with
Mr
Jennings
on
one
side
to
look
like
a
chaplain
,
and
a
supernumerary
on
the
other
,
with
an
old
life
-
guardsman
's
sabre
,
to
imitate
the
sword
-
bearer
;
and
to
see
the
tears
rolling
down
the
faces
of
the
mob
as
they
screamed
with
merriment
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
beautiful
!
<EOS>
and
so
was
the
appearance
of
Mrs
Tulrumble
and
son
,
as
they
bowed
with
grave
dignity
out
of
their
coach
-
window
to
all
the
dirty
faces
that
were
laughing
around
them
:
 
<EOS>
but
it
is
not
even
with
this
that
we
have
to
do
,
<EOS>
but
with
the
sudden
stopping
of
the
procession
at
another
blast
of
the
trumpet
,
whereat
,
and
whereupon
,
a
profound
silence
ensued
,
and
all
eyes
were
turned
towards
Mudfog
Hall
,
in
the
confident
anticipation
of
some
new
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
wo
n't
laugh
now
,
Mr
Jennings
,
"
said
Nicholas
Tulrumble
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Jennings
.
  
<EOS>
"
See
how
eager
they
look
,
"
said
Nicholas
Tulrumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
<EOS>
the
laugh
will
be
on
our
side
now
;
eh
,
Mr
Jennings
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
doubt
of
that
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Jennings
;
and
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
in
a
state
of
pleasurable
excitement
,
stood
up
in
the
four
-
wheel
chaise
,
and
telegraphed
gratification
to
the
Mayoress
behind
.
  
<EOS>
While
all
this
was
going
forward
,
Ned
Twigger
had
descended
into
the
kitchen
of
Mudfog
Hall
for
the
purpose
of
indulging
the
servants
with
a
private
view
of
the
curiosity
that
was
to
burst
upon
the
town
;
and
,
somehow
or
other
,
the
footman
was
so
companionable
,
and
the
housemaid
so
kind
,
and
the
cook
so
friendly
,
that
he
could
not
resist
the
offer
of
the
first
-
mentioned
to
sit
down
and
take
something
---
just
to
drink
success
to
master
in
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
down
Ned
Twigger
sat
himself
in
his
brass
livery
on
the
top
of
the
kitchen
-
table
;
and
in
a
mug
of
something
strong
,
paid
for
by
the
unconscious
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
and
provided
by
the
companionable
footman
,
drank
success
to
the
Mayor
and
his
procession
;
and
,
as
Ned
laid
by
his
helmet
to
imbibe
the
something
strong
,
the
companionable
footman
put
it
on
his
own
head
,
to
the
immeasurable
and
unrecordable
delight
of
the
cook
and
housemaid
.
<EOS>
The
companionable
footman
was
very
facetious
to
Ned
,
and
Ned
was
very
gallant
to
the
cook
and
housemaid
by
turns
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
all
very
cosy
and
comfortable
;
and
the
something
strong
went
briskly
round
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
Ned
Twigger
was
loudly
called
for
,
by
the
procession
people
:
 
and
,
having
had
his
helmet
fixed
on
,
in
a
very
complicated
manner
,
by
the
companionable
footman
,
and
the
kind
housemaid
,
and
the
friendly
cook
,
he
walked
gravely
forth
,
and
appeared
before
the
multitude
.
  
<EOS>
The
crowd
roared
---
it
was
not
with
wonder
,
it
was
not
with
surprise
;
it
was
most
decidedly
and
unquestionably
with
laughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
Mr
Tulrumble
,
starting
up
in
the
four
-
wheel
chaise
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Laughing
?
 
<EOS>
If
they
laugh
at
a
man
in
real
brass
armour
,
they
'd
laugh
when
their
own
fathers
were
dying
.
 
<EOS>
Why
does
n't
he
go
into
his
place
,
Mr
Jennings
?
 
<EOS>
What
's
he
rolling
down
towards
us
for
?
<EOS>
he
has
no
business
here
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
sir
---
"
faltered
Mr
Jennings
.
  
<EOS>
"
Afraid
of
what
,
sir
?
"
said
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
looking
up
into
the
secretary
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
he
's
drunk
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Jennings
.
  
<EOS>
Nicholas
Tulrumble
took
one
look
at
the
extraordinary
figure
that
was
bearing
down
upon
them
;
and
then
,
clasping
his
secretary
by
the
arm
,
uttered
an
audible
groan
in
anguish
of
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
melancholy
fact
that
Mr
Twigger
having
full
licence
to
demand
a
single
glass
of
rum
on
the
putting
on
of
every
piece
of
the
armour
,
got
,
by
some
means
or
other
,
rather
out
of
his
calculation
in
the
hurry
and
confusion
of
preparation
,
and
drank
about
four
glasses
to
a
piece
instead
of
one
,
not
to
mention
the
something
strong
which
went
on
the
top
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
the
brass
armour
checked
the
natural
flow
of
perspiration
,
and
thus
prevented
the
spirit
from
evaporating
,
we
are
not
scientific
enough
to
know
;
but
,
whatever
the
cause
was
,
Mr
Twigger
no
sooner
found
himself
outside
the
gate
of
Mudfog
Hall
,
than
he
also
found
himself
in
a
very
considerable
state
of
intoxication
;
and
hence
his
extraordinary
style
of
progressing
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
bad
enough
,
but
,
as
if
fate
and
fortune
had
conspired
against
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
Mr
Twigger
,
not
having
been
penitent
for
a
good
calendar
month
,
took
it
into
his
head
to
be
most
especially
and
particularly
sentimental
,
just
when
his
repentance
could
have
been
most
conveniently
dispensed
with
.
 
<EOS>
Immense
tears
were
rolling
down
his
cheeks
,
and
he
was
vainly
endeavouring
to
conceal
his
grief
by
applying
to
his
eyes
a
blue
cotton
pocket
-
handkerchief
with
white
spots
,
---
an
article
not
strictly
in
keeping
with
a
suit
of
armour
some
three
hundred
years
old
,
or
thereabouts
.
  
<EOS>
"
Twigger
,
you
villain
!
"
said
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
quite
forgetting
his
dignity
,
"
go
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
,
"
said
Ned
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
miserable
wretch
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
never
leave
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
by
-
standers
of
course
received
this
declaration
with
acclamations
of
"
That
's
right
,
Ned
;
do
n't
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
intend
it
,
"
said
Ned
,
with
all
the
obstinacy
of
a
very
tipsy
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
unhappy
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
the
wretched
father
of
an
unfortunate
family
;
but
I
am
very
faithful
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
never
leave
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Having
reiterated
this
obliging
promise
,
Ned
proceeded
in
broken
words
to
harangue
the
crowd
upon
the
number
of
years
he
had
lived
in
Mudfog
,
the
excessive
respectability
of
his
character
,
and
other
topics
of
the
like
nature
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
!
will
anybody
lead
him
away
?
"
said
Nicholas
:
 
<EOS>
"
if
they
'll
call
on
me
afterwards
,
I
'll
reward
them
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
Two
or
three
men
stepped
forward
,
with
the
view
of
bearing
Ned
off
,
when
the
secretary
interposed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
care
!
<EOS>
take
care
!
"
said
Mr
Jennings
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
;
but
they
'd
better
not
go
too
near
him
,
because
,
if
he
falls
over
,
he
'll
certainly
crush
somebody
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
hint
the
crowd
retired
on
all
sides
to
a
very
respectful
distance
,
and
left
Ned
,
like
the
Duke
of
Devonshire
,
in
a
little
circle
of
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Mr
Jennings
,
"
said
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
"
he
'll
be
suffocated
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
sorry
for
it
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Jennings
;
"
but
nobody
can
get
that
armour
off
,
without
his
own
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
quite
certain
of
it
from
the
way
he
put
it
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Ned
wept
dolefully
,
and
shook
his
helmeted
head
,
in
a
manner
that
might
have
touched
a
heart
of
stone
;
but
the
crowd
had
not
hearts
of
stone
,
and
they
laughed
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
Mr
Jennings
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
turning
pale
at
the
possibility
of
Ned
's
being
smothered
in
his
antique
costume
---
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
Mr
Jennings
,
can
nothing
be
done
with
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
at
all
,
"
replied
Ned
,
"
nothing
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
I
'm
an
unhappy
wretch
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
body
,
gentlemen
,
in
a
brass
coffin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
poetical
idea
of
his
own
conjuring
up
,
Ned
cried
so
much
that
the
people
began
to
get
sympathetic
,
and
to
ask
what
Nicholas
Tulrumble
meant
by
putting
a
man
into
such
a
machine
as
that
;
and
one
individual
in
a
hairy
waistcoat
like
the
top
of
a
trunk
,
who
had
previously
expressed
his
opinion
that
if
Ned
had
n't
been
a
poor
man
,
Nicholas
would
n't
have
dared
do
it
,
hinted
at
the
propriety
of
breaking
the
four
-
wheel
chaise
,
or
Nicholas
's
head
,
or
both
,
which
last
compound
proposition
the
crowd
seemed
to
consider
a
very
good
notion
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
acted
upon
,
however
,
for
it
had
hardly
been
broached
,
when
Ned
Twigger
's
wife
made
her
appearance
abruptly
in
the
little
circle
before
noticed
,
and
Ned
no
sooner
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
face
and
form
,
than
from
the
mere
force
of
habit
he
set
off
towards
his
home
just
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
;
and
that
was
not
very
quick
in
the
present
instance
either
,
for
,
however
ready
they
might
have
been
to
carry
HIM
,
they
could
n't
get
on
very
well
under
the
brass
armour
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
Mrs
Twigger
had
plenty
of
time
to
denounce
Nicholas
Tulrumble
to
his
face
:
 
to
express
her
opinion
that
he
was
a
decided
monster
;
and
to
intimate
that
,
if
her
ill
-
used
husband
sustained
any
personal
damage
from
the
brass
armour
,
she
would
have
the
law
of
Nicholas
Tulrumble
for
manslaughter
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
said
all
this
with
due
vehemence
,
she
posted
after
Ned
,
who
was
dragging
himself
along
as
best
he
could
,
and
deploring
his
unhappiness
in
most
dismal
tones
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
wailing
and
screaming
Ned
's
children
raised
when
he
got
home
at
last
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Twigger
tried
to
undo
the
armour
,
first
in
one
place
,
and
then
in
another
,
but
she
could
n't
manage
it
;
so
she
tumbled
Ned
into
bed
,
helmet
,
armour
,
gauntlets
,
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
creaking
as
the
bedstead
made
,
under
Ned
's
weight
in
his
new
suit
!
<EOS>
It
did
n't
break
down
though
;
and
there
Ned
lay
,
like
the
anonymous
vessel
in
the
Bay
of
Biscay
,
till
next
day
,
drinking
barley
-
water
,
and
looking
miserable
:
 
and
every
time
he
groaned
,
his
good
lady
said
it
served
him
right
,
which
was
all
the
consolation
Ned
Twigger
got
.
  
<EOS>
Nicholas
Tulrumble
and
the
gorgeous
procession
went
on
together
to
the
town
-
hall
,
amid
the
hisses
and
groans
of
all
the
spectators
,
who
had
suddenly
taken
it
into
their
heads
to
consider
poor
Ned
a
martyr
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
was
formally
installed
in
his
new
office
,
in
acknowledgment
of
which
ceremony
he
delivered
himself
of
a
speech
,
composed
by
the
secretary
,
which
was
very
long
,
and
no
doubt
very
good
,
<EOS>
only
the
noise
of
the
people
outside
prevented
anybody
from
hearing
it
,
but
Nicholas
Tulrumble
himself
.
 
<EOS>
After
which
,
the
procession
got
back
to
Mudfog
Hall
<EOS>
any
how
it
could
;
and
Nicholas
and
the
corporation
sat
down
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
dinner
was
flat
,
and
Nicholas
was
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
such
dull
sleepy
old
fellows
,
that
corporation
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
made
quite
as
long
speeches
as
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
had
done
,
nay
,
he
said
the
very
same
things
that
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
had
said
,
and
the
deuce
a
cheer
the
corporation
gave
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
man
in
the
party
who
was
thoroughly
awake
;
and
he
was
insolent
,
and
called
him
Nick
.
 
<EOS>
Nick
!
 
<EOS>
What
would
be
the
consequence
,
thought
Nicholas
,
of
anybody
presuming
to
call
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
"
Nick
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
should
like
to
know
what
the
sword
-
bearer
would
say
to
that
;
or
the
recorder
,
or
the
toast
-
master
,
or
any
other
of
the
great
officers
of
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
They
'd
nick
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
these
were
not
the
worst
of
Nicholas
Tulrumble
's
doings
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
had
been
,
he
might
have
remained
a
Mayor
to
this
day
,
and
have
talked
till
he
lost
his
voice
.
 
<EOS>
He
contracted
a
relish
for
statistics
,
and
got
philosophical
;
and
the
statistics
and
the
philosophy
together
,
led
him
into
an
act
which
increased
his
unpopularity
and
hastened
his
downfall
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
very
end
of
the
Mudfog
High
-
street
,
and
abutting
on
the
river
-
side
,
stands
the
Jolly
Boatmen
,
an
old
-
fashioned
low
-
roofed
,
bay
-
windowed
house
,
with
a
bar
,
kitchen
,
and
tap
-
room
all
in
one
,
and
a
large
fireplace
with
a
kettle
to
correspond
,
round
which
<EOS>
the
working
men
have
congregated
time
out
of
mind
on
a
winter
's
night
,
refreshed
by
draughts
of
good
strong
beer
,
and
cheered
by
the
sounds
of
a
fiddle
and
tambourine
:
 
the
Jolly
Boatmen
having
been
duly
licensed
by
the
Mayor
and
corporation
,
to
scrape
the
fiddle
and
thumb
the
tambourine
from
time
,
whereof
the
memory
of
the
oldest
inhabitants
goeth
not
to
the
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
Now
Nicholas
Tulrumble
had
been
reading
pamphlets
on
crime
,
and
parliamentary
reports
,
---
or
had
made
the
secretary
read
them
to
him
,
which
is
the
same
thing
in
effect
,
---
and
he
at
once
perceived
that
this
fiddle
and
tambourine
must
have
done
more
to
demoralize
Mudfog
,
than
any
other
operating
causes
that
ingenuity
could
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
read
up
for
the
subject
,
and
determined
to
come
out
on
the
corporation
with
a
burst
,
the
very
next
time
the
licence
was
applied
for
.
  
<EOS>
The
licensing
day
came
,
and
the
red
-
faced
landlord
of
the
Jolly
Boatmen
walked
into
the
town
-
hall
,
looking
as
jolly
as
need
be
,
having
actually
put
on
an
extra
fiddle
for
that
night
,
to
commemorate
the
anniversary
of
the
Jolly
Boatmen
's
music
licence
.
<EOS>
It
was
applied
for
in
due
form
,
and
was
just
about
to
be
granted
as
a
matter
of
course
,
when
up
rose
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
and
drowned
the
astonished
corporation
in
a
torrent
of
eloquence
.
 
<EOS>
He
descanted
in
glowing
terms
upon
the
increasing
depravity
of
his
native
town
of
Mudfog
,
and
the
excesses
committed
by
its
population
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
related
how
shocked
he
had
been
,
to
see
barrels
of
beer
sliding
down
into
the
cellar
of
the
Jolly
Boatmen
week
after
week
;
and
how
he
had
sat
at
a
window
opposite
the
Jolly
Boatmen
for
two
days
together
,
to
count
the
people
who
went
in
for
beer
between
the
hours
of
twelve
and
one
o'clock
alone
---
which
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
was
the
time
at
which
the
great
majority
of
the
Mudfog
people
dined
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
went
on
to
state
,
how
the
number
of
people
who
came
out
with
beer
-
jugs
,
averaged
twenty
-
one
in
five
minutes
,
which
,
being
multiplied
by
twelve
,
gave
two
hundred
and
fifty
-
two
people
with
beer
-
jugs
in
an
hour
,
and
multiplied
again
by
fifteen
<EOS>
(
the
number
of
hours
during
which
the
house
was
open
daily
)
yielded
three
thousand
seven
hundred
and
eighty
people
with
beer
-
jugs
per
day
,
or
twenty
-
six
thousand
four
hundred
and
sixty
people
with
beer
-
jugs
,
per
week
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
proceeded
to
show
that
a
tambourine
and
moral
degradation
were
synonymous
terms
,
and
a
fiddle
and
vicious
propensities
wholly
inseparable
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
arguments
he
strengthened
and
demonstrated
by
frequent
references
to
a
large
book
with
a
blue
cover
,
and
sundry
quotations
from
the
Middlesex
magistrates
;
and
in
the
end
,
the
corporation
,
who
were
posed
with
the
figures
,
and
sleepy
with
the
speech
,
and
sadly
in
want
of
dinner
into
the
bargain
,
yielded
the
palm
to
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
and
refused
the
music
licence
to
the
Jolly
Boatmen
.
  
<EOS>
But
although
Nicholas
triumphed
,
his
triumph
was
short
.
 
<EOS>
He
carried
on
the
war
against
beer
-
jugs
and
fiddles
,
forgetting
the
time
when
he
was
glad
to
drink
out
of
the
one
,
and
to
dance
to
the
other
,
till
the
people
hated
,
and
his
old
friends
shunned
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
grew
tired
of
the
lonely
magnificence
of
Mudfog
Hall
,
and
his
heart
yearned
towards
the
Lighterman
's
Arms
.
 
<EOS>
He
wished
he
had
never
set
up
as
a
public
man
,
and
sighed
for
the
good
old
times
of
the
coal
-
shop
,
and
the
chimney
corner
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
old
Nicholas
,
being
thoroughly
miserable
,
took
heart
of
grace
,
paid
the
secretary
a
quarter
's
wages
in
advance
,
and
packed
him
off
to
London
by
the
next
coach
.
 
<EOS>
Having
taken
this
step
,
he
put
his
hat
on
his
head
,
and
his
pride
in
his
pocket
,
and
walked
down
to
the
old
room
at
the
Lighterman
's
Arms
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
only
two
of
the
old
fellows
there
,
and
they
looked
coldly
on
Nicholas
as
he
proffered
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
put
down
pipes
,
Mr
Tulrumble
?
"
said
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
Or
trace
the
progress
of
crime
to
"
bacca
?
"
growled
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
Neither
,
"
replied
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
shaking
hands
with
them
both
,
whether
they
would
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
come
down
to
say
that
I
'm
very
sorry
for
having
made
a
fool
of
myself
,
and
that
I
hope
you
'll
give
me
up
the
old
chair
,
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
fellows
opened
their
eyes
,
and
three
or
four
more
old
fellows
opened
the
door
,
to
whom
Nicholas
,
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
thrust
out
his
hand
too
,
and
told
the
same
story
.
 
<EOS>
They
raised
a
shout
of
joy
,
that
made
the
bells
in
the
ancient
church
-
tower
vibrate
again
,
and
wheeling
the
old
chair
into
the
warm
corner
,
thrust
old
Nicholas
down
into
it
,
and
ordered
in
the
very
largest
-
sized
bowl
of
hot
punch
,
with
an
unlimited
number
of
pipes
,
directly
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
,
the
Jolly
Boatmen
got
the
licence
,
and
the
next
night
,
old
Nicholas
and
Ned
Twigger
's
wife
led
off
a
dance
to
the
music
of
the
fiddle
and
tambourine
,
the
tone
of
which
seemed
mightily
improved
by
a
little
rest
,
for
they
never
had
played
so
merrily
before
.
 
<EOS>
Ned
Twigger
was
in
the
very
height
of
his
glory
,
and
he
danced
hornpipes
,
and
balanced
chairs
on
his
chin
,
and
straws
on
his
nose
,
till
the
whole
company
,
including
the
corporation
,
were
in
raptures
of
admiration
at
the
brilliancy
of
his
acquirements
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tulrumble
,
junior
,
could
n't
make
up
his
mind
to
be
anything
but
magnificent
,
so
he
went
up
to
London
and
drew
bills
on
his
father
;
and
when
he
had
overdrawn
,
and
got
into
debt
,
he
grew
penitent
,
and
came
home
again
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
old
Nicholas
,
he
kept
his
word
,
and
having
had
six
weeks
of
public
life
,
never
tried
it
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
to
sleep
in
the
town
-
hall
at
the
very
next
meeting
;
and
,
in
full
proof
of
his
sincerity
,
has
requested
us
to
write
this
faithful
narrative
.
 
<EOS>
We
wish
it
could
have
the
effect
of
reminding
the
Tulrumbles
of
another
sphere
,
that
puffed
-
up
conceit
is
not
dignity
,
and
that
snarling
at
the
little
pleasures
they
were
once
glad
to
enjoy
,
because
they
would
rather
forget
the
times
when
they
were
of
lower
station
,
renders
them
objects
of
contempt
and
ridicule
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
the
first
time
we
have
published
any
of
our
gleanings
from
this
particular
source
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
at
some
future
period
,
we
may
venture
to
open
the
chronicles
of
Mudfog

<EOS>
Full
Report
Of
The
First
Meeting
Of
The
Mudfog
Association
For

Advancement

Everything
    
<EOS>
We
have
made
the
most
unparalleled
and
extraordinary
exertions
to
place
before
our
readers
a
complete
and
accurate
account
of
the
proceedings
at
the
late
grand
meeting
of
the
Mudfog
Association
,
holden
in
the
town
of
Mudfog
;
it
affords
us
great
happiness
to
lay
the
result
before
them
,
in
the
shape
of
various
communications
received
from
our
able
,
talented
,
and
graphic
correspondent
,
expressly
sent
down
for
the
purpose
,
who
has
immortalized
us
,
himself
,
Mudfog
,
and
the
association
,
all
at
one
and
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
We
have
been
,
indeed
,
for
some
days
unable
to
determine
who
will
transmit
the
greatest
name
to
posterity
;
ourselves
,
who
sent
our
correspondent
down
;
our
correspondent
,
who
wrote
an
account
of
the
matter
;
or
the
association
,
who
gave
our
correspondent
something
to
write
about
.
 
<EOS>
We
rather
incline
to
the
opinion
that
we
are
the
greatest
man
of
the
party
,
inasmuch
as
the
notion
of
an
exclusive
and
authentic
report
originated
with
us
;
this
may
be
prejudice
:
 
<EOS>
it
may
arise
from
a
prepossession
on
our
part
in
our
own
favour
.
 
<EOS>
Be
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
doubt
that
every
gentleman
concerned
in
this
mighty
assemblage
is
troubled
with
the
same
complaint
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
;
and
it
is
a
consolation
to
us
to
know
that
we
have
at
least
this
feeling
in
common
with
the
great
scientific
stars
,
the
brilliant
and
extraordinary
luminaries
,
whose
speculations
we
record
.
  
<EOS>
We
give
our
correspondent
's
letters
in
the
order
in
which
they
reached
us
.
 
<EOS>
Any
attempt
at
amalgamating
them
into
one
beautiful
whole
,
would
only
destroy
that
glowing
tone
,
that
dash
of
wildness
,
and
rich
vein
of
picturesque
interest
,
which
pervade
them
throughout
.

We
are
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
here
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
is
spoken
of
,
but
the
approaching
meeting
of
the
association
.
 
<EOS>
The
inn
-
doors
are
thronged
with
waiters
anxiously
looking
for
the
expected
arrivals
;
and
the
numerous
bills
which
are
wafered
up
in
the
windows
of
private
houses
,
intimating
that
there
are
beds
to
let
within
,
give
the
streets
a
very
animated
and
cheerful
appearance
,
the
wafers
being
of
a
great
variety
of
colours
,
and
the
monotony
of
printed
inscriptions
being
relieved
by
every
possible
size
and
style
of
hand

writing
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
confidently
rumoured
that
Professors
Snore
,
Doze
,
and
Wheezy
have
engaged
three
beds
and
a
sitting

room
at
the
Pig

I
give
you
the
rumour
as
it
has
reached
me
;
but
I
can
not
,
as
yet
,
vouch
for
its
accuracy
.
 
<EOS>
The
moment
I
have
been
enabled
to
obtain
any
certain
information
upon
this
interesting
point

it

PAST

<EOS>
I
have
just
returned
from
a
personal
interview
with
the
landlord
of
the
Pig
and
Tinder
-
box
.
 
<EOS>
He
speaks
confidently
of
the
probability
of
Professors
Snore
,
Doze
,
and
Wheezy
taking
up
their
residence
at
his
house
during
the
sitting
of
the
association
,
but
denies
that
the
beds
have
been
yet
engaged
;
in
which
representation
he
is
confirmed
by
the
chambermaid
---
a
girl
of
artless
manners
,
and
interesting
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
The
boots
denies
that
it
is
at
all
likely
that
Professors
Snore
,
Doze
,
and
Wheezy
will
put
up
here
;
but
I
have
reason
to
believe
that
this
man
has
been
suborned
by
the
proprietor
of
the
Original
Pig
,
which
is
the
opposition
hotel
.
<EOS>
Amidst
such
conflicting
testimony
it
is
difficult
to
arrive
at
the
real
truth
;
but
you
may
depend
upon
receiving
authentic
information
upon
this
point
the
moment
the
fact
is
ascertained
.
 
<EOS>
The
excitement
still
continues
.

A
boy
fell
through
the
window

the
pastrycook

At
an
early
hour
this
morning
the
bells
of
all
the
churches
struck
seven
o'clock
;
the
effect
of
which
,
in
the

lively
state
of

,
was
extremely
singular
.

While
I
was
at
breakfast
,
a
yellow
gig
,
drawn
by
a
dark
grey
horse
,
with
a
patch
of
white
over
his
right
eyelid
,
proceeded
at
a
rapid
pace
in
the
direction
of
the
Original
Pig
stables
;
it
is
currently
reported
that
this
gentleman
has
arrived
here
for
the
purpose
of
attending
the
association
,
and
,
from
what
I
have
heard
,
I
consider
it
extremely
probable
,
although
nothing
decisive
is
yet
known
regarding
him

You
may
conceive
the
anxiety

which
we

all
looking

the
arrival

afternoon

Notwithstanding
the
excited
state

no
outrage
has
yet
been
committed

It
is
now
ascertained

beyond

that
Professors
Snore

Doze

will
NOT
repair
to

have
actually
engaged
apartments
at

<EOS>
This
intelligence
is
EXCLUSIVE
;

I
leave
you
and
your
readers
to
draw
their
own
inferences
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
Why
Professor
Wheezy
,
of
all
people
in
the
world
,
should
repair
to
the
Original
Pig
in
preference
to
the
Pig
and
Tinder

box
,
it
is
not
easy
to
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
The
professor
is
a
man
who
should
be
above
all
such
petty
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
Some
people
here
openly
impute
treachery
,
and
a
distinct
breach
of
faith
to
Professors
Snore
and
Doze
;
while
others
,
again
,
are
disposed
to
acquit
them
of
any
culpability
in
the
transaction
,
and
to
insinuate
that
the
blame
rests
solely
with
Professor
Wheezy
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
that
I
incline
to
the
latter
opinion
;
and
although
it
gives
me
great
pain
to
speak
in
terms
of
censure
or
disapprobation
of
a
man
of
such
transcendent
genius
and
acquirements
,
still
I
am
bound
to
say
that
,
if
my
suspicions
be
well
founded
,
and
if
all
the
reports
which
have
reached
my
ears
be
true

I
really
do
not
well

Mr

,
so
celebrated
for
his
statistical
researches

arrived
this
afternoon
by
the
four
o'clock
stage

<EOS>
His
complexion
is
a
dark
purple
,

he
has
a
habit

sighing
constantly

looked
extremely
well

appeared

high
health

Mr

came
down

I
am
informed

he
had
been
so
the
whole
way

<EOS>
He
was
,
no
doubt
,
preparing
for
his
approaching
fatigues
;
but
what
gigantic
visions
must
those
be
that
flit
through
the
brain
of
such
a
man

that
two
post

have
arrived
at

the
last

myself
observed

entering

The
people
are
still
quietly
pursuing

there
is
a
wildness
in
their
eyes

and
an
unwonted
rigidity
in
the
muscles
of
their
countenances
,
which
shows
to
the
observant
spectator
that
their
expectations
are
strained
to
the
very

pitch

fear
,
unless
some
very
extraordinary
arrivals
take
place

consequences
may
arise

died

just
driven
up

they
at

ordered
dinner
with
great
condescension

are
all
very

delighted
with
the

which
they
adapt
themselves

Immediately
on
their
arrival
they
sent
for
the

privately
requested
him
to
purchase
a

has
just

rung
for
.
 
<EOS>
With
an
instinct
which
would
appear
almost
the
result
of
reason
,
the
sagacious
animal
seized
the
waiter
by
the
calf
of
the
leg
when
he
approached
to
take
him
,
and
made
a
desperate
,
though
ineffectual
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
able
to
procure
admission
to
the
apartment
occupied
by
the
scientific
gentlemen
;
but
,
judging
from
the
sounds
which
reached
my
ears
when
I
stood
upon
the
landing
-
place
outside
the
door
,
just
now
,
I
should
be
disposed
to
say
that
the
dog
had
retreated
growling
beneath
some
article
of
furniture
,
and
was
keeping
the
professors
at
bay
.
 
<EOS>
This
conjecture
is
confirmed
by
the
testimony
of
the
ostler
,
who
,
after
peeping
through
the
keyhole
,
assures
me
that
he
distinctly
saw
Professor
Nogo
on
his
knees
,
holding
forth
a
small
bottle
of
prussic
acid
,
to
which
the
animal
,
who
was
crouched
beneath
an
arm
-
chair
,
obstinately
declined
to
smell
.

You
can
not
imagine
the
feverish
state
of
irritation
we
are
in
,
lest
the
interests
of
science
should
be
sacrificed
to
the
prejudices
of
a
brute
creature
,
who
is
not
endowed
with
sufficient
sense
to
foresee
the
incalculable
benefits
which
the
whole
human
race
may
derive
from
so

so
overpowered
by
what
has
taken
place
in
the
course

last
hour
and
a
half
,
that
I
have
scarcely
strength
to
detail
the
rapid
succession
of
events
which
have
quite
bewildered
all
those
who
are
cognizant
of
their
occurrence

<EOS>
It
appears
that
the
pug
-
dog
mentioned
in
my
last
was
surreptitiously
obtained
,
---
stolen
,
in
fact
,
---
by
some
person
attached
to
the
stable
department
,
from
an
unmarried
lady
resident
in
this
town
.
<EOS>
Frantic
on
discovering
the
loss
of
her
favourite
,
the
lady
rushed
distractedly
into
the
street
,
calling
in
the
most
heart
-
rending
and
pathetic
manner
upon
the
passengers
to
restore
her
,
her
Augustus
,
---
for
so
the
deceased
was
named
,
in
affectionate
remembrance
of
a
former
lover
of
his
mistress
,
to
whom
he
bore
a
striking
personal
resemblance
,
which
renders
the
circumstances
additionally
affecting
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
yet
in
a
condition
to
inform
you
what
circumstance
induced
the
bereaved
lady
to
direct
her
steps
to
the
hotel
which
had
witnessed
the
last
struggles
of
her
PROTEGE
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
only
state
that
she
arrived
there
,
at
the
very
instant
when
his
detached
members
were
passing
through
the
passage
on
a
small
tray
.
<EOS>
Her
shrieks
still
reverberate
in
my
ears
!
 
<EOS>
I
grieve
to
say
that
the
expressive
features
of
Professor
Muff
were
much
scratched
and
lacerated
by
the
injured
lady
;
and
that
Professor
Nogo
,
besides
sustaining
several
severe
bites
,
has
lost
some
handfuls
of
hair
from
the
same
cause
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
some
consolation
to
these
gentlemen
to
know
that
their
ardent
attachment
to
scientific
pursuits
has
alone
occasioned
these
unpleasant
consequences
;
for
which
the
sympathy
of
a
grateful
country
will
sufficiently
reward
them
.

unfortunate
lady

set

after

and
,
instead
of
taking
up
their
quarters
at
the
Original
Pig
,
as
it
was
universally
understood
in
the
course
of
yesterday
that
they
would
assuredly
have
done

drove
straight
to

where
they
threw
off
the
mask
at

intention

remaining

Professor
Wheezy
may
reconcile
this
very
extraordinary
conduct

equitable
dealing

I
would
recommend
Professor
Wheezy
to
be
cautious

were
under
the
necessity
last
night
of
sleeping
in
the
brick
fields

on
the
steps
of
doors

for
which
they
were
taken
before
the
magistrates
in
a
body
this
morning
,
and
committed
to
prison
as
vagrants
for
various
terms

<EOS>
One
of
these
persons
I
understand
to
be
a
highly

respectable
tinker

skill

pipkins
with
copper
bottoms

report
speaks
highly

The
incarceration
of
this
gentleman

greatly
to
be
regretted

absence

heard

attendance

I
can
scarcely
believe
it

The
excitement

dreadful

I
was
informed
this
morning
that
the
civil
authorities
,
apprehensive
of
some
outbreak
of
popular
feeling
,
had
commanded
a
recruiting
sergeant
and
two
corporals
to
be
under
arms
;
and
that
,
with
the
view
of
not
irritating
the
people
unnecessarily
by
their
presence
,
they
had
been
requested
to
take
up
their
position
before
daybreak
in
a
turnpike
,
distant
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
town

The
vigour

promptness
of
these
measures
can
not
be

highly
extolled

The
scene
at

was
particularly
striking
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
streamed
through
the
windows
of
the
apartments
,
and
tinted
the
whole
scene
with
its
brilliant
rays
,
bringing
out
in
strong
relief
the
noble
visages
of
the
professors
and
scientific
gentlemen

who
,
some
with
bald

presented

which

In

were

;
and
round
the
room
,
on
elevated
benches
extending
as
far

were
assembled
a
brilliant
concourse

called

Some
remarks
on
the
industrious

,
with
considerations
on
the
importance
of
establishing
infant

schools
among
that
numerous

of
directing
their
industry
to
useful
and

providing
for

a

and

in

age

<EOS>

The
author
stated
,
that
,
having
long
turned
his
attention
to
the
moral
and
social
condition
of
these
interesting
animals
,
he
had
been
induced
to
visit
an
exhibition
in
Regent
-
street
,
London
,
commonly
known
by
the
designation
of
"
The
Industrious
Fleas
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
had
there
seen
many
fleas
,
occupied
certainly
in
various
pursuits
and
avocations
,
but
occupied
,
he
was
bound
to
add
,
in
a
manner
which
no
man
of
well
-
regulated
mind
could
fail
to
regard
with
sorrow
and
regret
.
 
<EOS>
One
flea
,
reduced
to
the
level
of
a
beast
of
burden
,
was
drawing
about
a
miniature
gig
,
containing
a
particularly
small
effigy
of
His
Grace
the
Duke
of
Wellington
;
while
another
was
staggering
beneath
the
weight
of
a
golden
model
of
his
great
adversary
Napoleon
Bonaparte
.
 
<EOS>
Some
,
brought
up
as
mountebanks
and
ballet
-
dancers
,
were
performing
a
figure
-
dance
<EOS>
(
he
regretted
to
observe
,
that
,
of
the
fleas
so
employed
,
several
were
females
)
;
others
were
in
training
,
in
a
small
card
-
board
box
,
for
pedestrians
,
---
mere
sporting
characters
---
and
two
were
actually
engaged
in
the
cold
-
blooded
and
barbarous
occupation
of
duelling
;
a
pursuit
from
which
humanity
recoiled
with
horror
and
disgust
.
 
<EOS>
He
suggested
that
measures
should
be
immediately
taken
to
employ
the
labour
of
these
fleas
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
productive
power
of
the
country
,
which
might
easily
be
done
by
the
establishment
among
them
of
infant
schools
and
houses
of
industry
,
in
which
a
system
of
virtuous
education
,
based
upon
sound
principles
,
should
be
observed
,
and
moral
precepts
strictly
inculcated
.
 
<EOS>
He
proposed
that
every
flea
who
presumed
to
exhibit
,
for
hire
,
music
,
or
dancing
,
or
any
species
of
theatrical
entertainment
,
without
a
licence
,
should
be
considered
a
vagabond
,
and
treated
accordingly
;
in
which
respect
he
only
placed
him
upon
a
level
with
the
rest
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
further
suggest
that
their
labour
should
be
placed
under
the
control
and
regulation
of
the
state
,
who
should
set
apart
from
the
profits
,
a
fund
for
the
support
of
superannuated
or
disabled
fleas
,
their
widows
and
orphans
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
he
proposed
that
liberal
premiums
should
be
offered
for
the
three
best
designs
for
a
general
almshouse
;
from
which
---
as
insect
architecture
was
well
known
to
be
in
a
very
advanced
and
perfect
state
---
we
might
possibly
derive
many
valuable
hints
for
the
improvement
of
our
metropolitan
universities
,
national
galleries
,
and
other
public
edifices
.

THE
PRESIDENT
wished
to
be
informed
how
the
ingenious
gentleman
proposed
to
open
a
communication
with
fleas
generally
,
in
the
first
instance
,
so
that
they
might
be
thoroughly
imbued
with
a
sense
of
the
advantages
they
must
necessarily
derive
from
changing
their
mode
of
life
,
and
applying
themselves
to
honest
labour
.
 
<EOS>
This
appeared
to
him
,
<EOS>
the
only
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
THE
AUTHOR
submitted
that
this
difficulty
was
easily
overcome
,
or
rather
that
there
was
no
difficulty
at
all
in
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
Obviously
the
course
to
be
pursued
,
if
Her
Majesty
's
government
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
take
up
the
plan
,
would
be
,
to
secure
at
a
remunerative
salary
the
individual
to
whom
he
had
alluded
as
presiding
over
the
exhibition
in
Regent
-
street
at
the
period
of
his
visit
.
 
<EOS>
That
gentleman
would
at
once
be
able
to
put
himself
in
communication
with
the
mass
of
the
fleas
,
and
to
instruct
them
in
pursuance
of
some
general
plan
of
education
,
to
be
sanctioned
by
Parliament
,
until
such
time
as
the
more
intelligent
among
them
were
advanced
enough
to
officiate
as
teachers
to
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
President
and
several
members
of
the
section
highly
complimented
the
author
of
the
paper
last
read
,
on
his
most
ingenious
and
important
treatise
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
determined
that
the
subject
should
be
recommended
to
the
immediate
consideration
of
the
council
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
WIGSBY
produced
a
cauliflower
somewhat
larger
than
a
chaise
-
umbrella
,
which
had
been
raised
by
no
other
artificial
means
than
the
simple
application
of
highly
carbonated
soda
-
water
as
manure
.
<EOS>
He
explained
that
by
scooping
out
the
head
,
which
would
afford
a
new
and
delicious
species
of
nourishment
for
the
poor
,
a
parachute
,
in
principle
something
similar
to
that
constructed
by
M
Garnerin
,
was
at
once
obtained
;
the
stalk
of
course
being
kept
downwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
added
that
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
make
a
descent
from
a
height
of
not
less
than
three
miles
and
a
quarter
;
and
had
in
fact
already
proposed
the
same
to
the
proprietors
of
Vauxhall
Gardens
,
who
in
the
handsomest
manner
at
once
consented
to
his
wishes
,
and
appointed
an
early
day
next
summer
for
the
undertaking
;
merely
stipulating
that
the
rim
of
the
cauliflower
should
be
previously
broken
in
three
or
four
places
to
ensure
the
safety
of
the
descent
.
  
<EOS>
"
THE
PRESIDENT
congratulated
the
public
on
the
GRAND
GALA
in
store
for
them
,
and
warmly
eulogised
the
proprietors
of
the
establishment
alluded
to
,
for
their
love
of
science
,
and
regard
for
the
safety
of
human
life
,
both
of
which
did
them
the
highest
honour
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
Member
wished
to
know
how
many
thousand
additional
lamps
the
royal
property
would
be
illuminated
with
,
on
the
night
after
the
descent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
WIGSBY
replied
that
the
point
was
not
yet
finally
decided
;
but
he
believed
it
was
proposed
,
over
and
above
the
ordinary
illuminations
,
to
exhibit
in
various
devices
eight
millions
and
a
-
half
of
additional
lamps
.
  
<EOS>

The
Member
expressed
himself
much
gratified
with
this
announcement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
BLUNDERUM
delighted
the
section
with
a
most
interesting
and
valuable
paper
"
on
the
last
moments
of
the
learned
pig
,
"
which
produced
a
very
strong
impression
on
the
assembly
,
the
account
being
compiled
from
the
personal
recollections
of
his
favourite
attendant
.
 
<EOS>
The
account
stated
in
the
most
emphatic
terms
that
the
animal
's
name
was
not
Toby
,
but
Solomon
;
and
distinctly
proved
that
he
could
have
no
near
relatives
in
the
profession
,
as
many
designing
persons
had
falsely
stated
,
inasmuch
as
his
father
,
mother
,
brothers
and
sisters
,
had
all
fallen
victims
to
the
butcher
at
different
times
.
 
<EOS>
An
uncle
of
his
indeed
,
had
with
very
great
labour
been
traced
to
a
sty
in
Somers
Town
;
but
as
he
was
in
a
very
infirm
state
at
the
time
,
being
afflicted
with
measles
,
and
shortly
afterwards
disappeared
,
there
appeared
too
much
reason
to
conjecture
that
he
had
been
converted
into
sausages
.
 
<EOS>
The
disorder
of
the
learned
pig
was
originally
a
severe
cold
,
which
,
being
aggravated
by
excessive
trough
indulgence
,
finally
settled
upon
the
lungs
,
and
terminated
in
a
general
decay
of
the
constitution
.
 
<EOS>
A
melancholy
instance
of
a
presentiment
entertained
by
the
animal
of
his
approaching
dissolution
,
was
recorded
.
 
<EOS>
After
gratifying
a
numerous
and
fashionable
company
with
his
performances
,
in
which
no
falling
off
whatever
was
visible
,
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
biographer
,
and
,
turning
to
the
watch
which
lay
on
the
floor
,
and
on
which
he
was
accustomed
to
point
out
the
hour
,
deliberately
passed
his
snout
twice
round
the
dial
.
 
<EOS>
In
precisely
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
from
that
time
he
had
ceased
to
exist
!
  
<EOS>
"
PROFESSOR
WHEEZY
inquired
whether
,
previous
to
his
demise
,
the
animal
had
expressed
,
by
signs
or
otherwise
,
any
wishes
regarding
the
disposal
of
his
little
property
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
BLUNDERUM
replied
,
that
,
when
the
biographer
took
up
the
pack
of
cards
at
the
conclusion
of
the
performance
,
the
animal
grunted
several
times
in
a
significant
manner
,
and
nodding
his
head
as
he
was
accustomed
to
do
,
when
gratified
.
 
<EOS>
From
these
gestures
it
was
understood
that
he
wished
the
attendant
to
keep
the
cards
,
which
he
had
ever
since
done
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
expressed
any
wish
relative
to
his
watch
,
which
had
accordingly
been
pawned
by
the
same
individual
.
  
<EOS>
"
THE
PRESIDENT
wished
to
know
whether
any
Member
of
the
section
had
ever
seen
or
conversed
with
the
pig
-
faced
lady
,
who
was
reported
to
have
worn
a
black
velvet
mask
,
and
to
have
taken
her
meals
from
a
golden
trough
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
some
hesitation
a
Member
replied
that
the
pig
-
faced
lady
was
his
mother
-
in
-
law
,
and
that
he
trusted
the
President
would
not
violate
the
sanctity
of
private
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
THE
PRESIDENT
begged
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
considered
the
pig
-
faced
lady
a
public
character
.
 
<EOS>
Would
the
honourable
member
object
to
state
,
with
a
view
to
the
advancement
of
science
,
whether
she
was
in
any
way
connected
with
the
learned
pig
?
  
<EOS>
"
The
Member
replied
in
the
same
low
tone
,
that
,
as
the
question
appeared
to
involve
a
suspicion
that
the
learned
pig
might
be
his
half
-
brother
,
he
must
decline
answering
it
.

peculiarly
alarming
to
any
medical
man
.
 
<EOS>
His
frame
was
stout
and
muscular
,
his
step
firm
and
elastic
,
his
cheeks
plump
and
red
,
his
voice
loud
,
his
appetite
good
,
his
pulse
full
and
round
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
constant
habit
of
eating
three
meals
PER
DIEM
,
and
of
drinking
at
least
one
bottle
of
wine
,
and
one
glass
of
spirituous
liquors
diluted
with
water
,
in
the
course
of
the
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
.
 
<EOS>
He
laughed
constantly
,
and
in
so
hearty
a
manner
that
it
was
terrible
to
hear
him
.
 
<EOS>
By
dint
of
powerful
medicine
,
low
diet
,
and
bleeding
,
the
symptoms
in
the
course
of
three
days
perceptibly
decreased
.
 
<EOS>
A
rigid
perseverance
in
the
same
course
of
treatment
for
only
one
week
,
accompanied
with
small
doses
of
water
-
gruel
,
weak
broth
,
and
barley
-
water
,
led
to
their
entire
disappearance
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
a
month
he
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
be
carried
down
-
stairs
by
two
nurses
,
and
to
enjoy
an
airing
in
a
close
carriage
,
supported
by
soft
pillows
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
present
moment
he
was
restored
so
far
as
to
walk
about
,
with
the
slight
assistance
of
a
crutch
and
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
perhaps
be
gratifying
to
the
section
to
learn
that
he
ate
little
,
drank
little
,
slept
little
,
and
was
never
heard
to
laugh
by
any
accident
whatever

Oh

great
readiness

so
extraordinary
a
cure
could
never

Mr
KNIGHT
BELL
(
M

exhibited
a
wax
preparation
of
the
interior
of
a
gentleman
who
in
early
life
had
inadvertently
swallowed
a
door
-
key
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
curious
fact
that
a
medical
student
of
dissipated
habits
,
being
present
at
the
POST
MORTEM
examination
,
found
means
to
escape
unobserved
from
the
room
,
with
that
portion
of
the
coats
of
the
stomach
upon
which
an
exact
model
of
the
instrument
was
distinctly
impressed
,
with
which
he
hastened
to
a
locksmith
of
doubtful
character
,
who
made
a
new
key
from
the
pattern
so
shown
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
key
the
medical
student
entered
the
house
of
the
deceased
gentleman
,
and
committed
a
burglary
to
a
large
amount
,
for
which
he
was
subsequently
tried
and
executed
.
  
<EOS>
"
THE
PRESIDENT
wished
to
know
what
became
of
the
original
key
after
the
lapse
of
years
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Knight
Bell
replied
that
the
gentleman
was
always
much
accustomed
to
punch
,
and
it
was
supposed
the
acid
had
gradually
devoured
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dr
NEESHAWTS
and
several
of
the
members
were
of
opinion
that
the
key
must
have
lain
very
cold
and
heavy
upon
the
gentleman
's
stomach
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
KNIGHT
BELL
believed
it
did
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
worthy
of
remark
,
perhaps
,
that
for
some
years
the
gentleman
was
troubled
with
a
night
-
mare
,
under
the
influence
of
which
he
always
imagined
himself
a
wine
-
cellar
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
PROFESSOR
MUFF
related
a
very
extraordinary
and
convincing
proof
of
the
wonderful
efficacy
of
the
system
of
infinitesimal
doses
,
which
the
section
were
doubtless
aware
was
based
upon
the
theory
that
the
very
minutest
amount
of
any
given
drug
,
properly
dispersed
through
the
human
frame
,
would
be
productive
of
precisely
the
same
result
as
a
very
large
dose
administered
in
the
usual
manner
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
the
fortieth
part
of
a
grain
of
calomel
was
supposed
to
be
equal
to
a
five
-
grain
calomel
pill
,
and
so
on
in
proportion
throughout
the
whole
range
of
medicine
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
tried
the
experiment
in
a
curious
manner
upon
a
publican
who
had
been
brought
into
the
hospital
with
a
broken
head
,
and
was
cured
upon
the
infinitesimal
system
in
the
incredibly
short
space
of
three
months
.
<EOS>
This
man
was
a
hard
drinker
.
 
<EOS>
He
(
Professor
Muff
)
had
dispersed
three
drops
of
rum
through
a
bucket
of
water
,
and
requested
the
man
to
drink
the
whole
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
the
result
?
 
<EOS>
Before
he
had
drunk
a
quart
,
he
was
in
a
state
of
beastly
intoxication
;
and
five
other
men
were
made
dead
drunk
with
the
remainder
.
  
<EOS>
"
THE
PRESIDENT
wished
to
know
whether
an
infinitesimal
dose
of
soda
-
water
would
have
recovered
them
?
 
<EOS>
Professor
Muff
replied
that
the
twenty
-
fifth
part
of
a
teaspoonful
,
properly
administered
to
each
patient
,
would
have
sobered
him
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
The
President
remarked
that
this
was
a
most
important
discovery
,
and
he
hoped
the
Lord
Mayor
and
Court
of
Aldermen
would
patronize
it
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
Member
begged
to
be
informed
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
administer
---
say
,
the
twentieth
part
of
a
grain
of
bread
and
cheese
to
all
grown
-
up
paupers
,
and
the
fortieth
part
to
children
,
with
the
same
satisfying
effect
as
their
present
allowance
.
  
<EOS>
"
PROFESSOR
MUFF
was
willing
to
stake
his
professional
reputation
on
the
perfect
adequacy
of
such
a
quantity
of
food
to
the
support
of
human
life
---
in
workhouses
;
the
addition
of
the
fifteenth
part
of
a
grain
of
pudding
twice
a
week
would
render
it

high

PROFESSOR

called
the

A

being
merely
looked
at

was
at

observed
to
be
in

He
was
followed
to
his
box

and
being
once
slightly
rubbed
on

fell
into

the

and
labour
,
regarding
the
state
of

found
that

He
found
that
the
proportion
of
Robinson
Crusoes
to
Philip
Quarlls
was
as
four
and
a
half
to
one
;
and
that
the
preponderance
of
Valentine

over
Goody
Two
Shoeses
was
as
three

an
eighth
of
the
former
to
half
a
one
of

;
a
comparison
of
Seven

gave
the

The
ignorance
that
prevailed

was
lamentable

One
child
,
on
being
asked
whether
he
would
rather
be
Saint
George
of
England

a
respectable
tallow

chandler
,
instantly
replied
,
"
Taint
George

"
 
<EOS>
Another
,
a
little
boy
of
eight
years
old
,
was
found
to
be
firmly
impressed
with
a
belief
in
the
existence
of
dragons
,
and
openly
stated
that
it
was
his
intention
when
he
grew
up
,
to
rush
forth
sword
in

for
the
deliverance
of

the
promiscuous
slaughter

<EOS>
Not
one
child
among

interrogated
had
ever
heard
of
Mungo

<EOS>
some
inquiring
whether
he
was
at
all
connected
with
the
black
man
that
swept
the
crossing
;
and
others
whether
he
was
in
any

related

Regent

<EOS>
They
had
not
the

conception

considered
Sindbad

"
A
Member
strongly
deprecating
the
use
of
all
the
other
books
mentioned
,
suggested
that
Jack
and
Jill
might
perhaps
be
exempted
from
the
general
censure
,
inasmuch
as
the
hero
and
heroine
,
in
the
very
outset
of
the
tale
,
were
depicted
as
going
UP
a
hill
to
fetch
a
pail
of
water
,
which
was
a
laborious

useful
occupation

supposing

"
Mr

feared
that
the
moral
effect
of

passage
was
more
than
counterbalanced
by
another
in
a
subsequent
part

poem

very
gross

made

excellent
distinction

had
drawn

Several

dwelt
upon
the
immense

urgent
necessity

storing
the

nothing

facts

figures

which
process
the

very
forcibly
remarked

were

"
Mr
SLUG
then
stated
some
curious
calculations
respecting
the
dogs'-meat
barrows
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
that
the
total
number
of
small
carts
and
barrows
engaged
in
dispensing
provision
to
the
cats
and
dogs
of
the
metropolis
was
,
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
forty
-
three
.
 
<EOS>
The
average
number
of
skewers
delivered
daily
with
the
provender
,
by
each
dogs'-meat
cart
or
barrow
,
was
thirty
-
six
.
<EOS>
Now
,
multiplying
the
number
of
skewers
so
delivered
by
the
number
of
barrows
,
a
total
of
sixty
-
two
thousand
seven
hundred
and
forty
-
eight
skewers
daily
would
be
obtained
.
 
<EOS>
Allowing
that
,
of
these
sixty
-
two
thousand
seven
hundred
and
forty
-
eight
skewers
,
the
odd
two
thousand
seven
hundred
and
forty
-
eight
were
accidentally
devoured
with
the
meat
,
by
the
most
voracious
of
the
animals
supplied
,
it
followed
that
sixty
thousand
skewers
per
day
,
or
the
enormous
number
of
twenty
-
one
millions
nine
hundred
thousand
skewers
annually
,
were
wasted
in
the
kennels
and
dustholes
of
London
;
which
,
if
collected
and
warehoused
,
would
in
ten
years
'
time
afford
a
mass
of
timber
more
than
sufficient
for
the
construction
of
a
first

rate
vessel
of
war
for
the
use
of
her
Majesty
's
navy
,
to
be
called
"
The
Royal

to
become
under
that
name
the
terror
of
all
the
enemies

"
Mr
X
LEDBRAIN
read
a
very
ingenious
communication
,
from
which
it
appeared
that
the
total
number
of
legs
belonging
to
the
manufacturing
population
of
one
great
town
in
Yorkshire
was
,
in
round
numbers
,
forty
thousand
,
while
the
total
number
of
chair
and
stool
legs
in
their
houses
was
only
thirty
thousand
,
which
,
upon
the
very
favourable
average
of
three
legs
to
a
seat
,
yielded
only
ten
thousand
seats
in
all
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
calculation
it
would
appear
,
---
not
taking
wooden
or
cork
legs
into
the
account
,
but
allowing
two
legs
to
every
person
,
---
that
ten
thousand
individuals
(
one

half
of
the
whole
population
)
were
either
destitute
of
any
rest
for
their
legs
at
all

passed
the
whole
of
their
leisure
time
in
sitting
upon

It

he
had
provided
for
this
difficulty
by
proposing
that
the
best
line
that
the

would
admit

should
be
taken
through
the
sewers

undermine
the

metropolis
,
and
which
,
well
lighted

jets

the

belonged
.
 
<EOS>
The
quicksilver
was
so
ingeniously
placed
,
that
when
the
acting
directors
held
shares
in
their
pockets
,
figures
denoting
very
small
expenses
and
very
large
returns
appeared
upon
the
glass
;
but
the
moment
the
directors
parted
with
these
pieces
of
paper
,
the
estimate
of
needful
expenditure
suddenly
increased
itself
to
an
immense
extent
,
while
the
statements
of
certain
profits
became
reduced
in
the
same
proportion
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jobba
stated
that
the
machine
had
been
in
constant
requisition
for
some
months
past
,
and
he
had
never
once
known
it
to
fail
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
Member
expressed
his
opinion
that
it
was
extremely
neat
and
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
He
wished
to
know
whether
it
was
not
liable
to
accidental
derangement
?
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jobba
said
that
the
whole
machine
was
undoubtedly
liable
to
be
blown
up
,
but
that
was
the
only
objection
to
it
.

PROFESSOR
NOGO
arrived
from
the
anatomical
section
to
exhibit
a
model
of
a
safety
fire
-
escape
,
which
could
be
fixed
at
any
time
,
in
less
than
half
an
hour
,
and
by
means
of
which
,
the
youngest
or
most
infirm
persons
(
successfully
resisting
the
progress
of
the
flames
until
it
was
quite
ready
)
could
be
preserved
if
they
merely
balanced
themselves
for
a
few
minutes
on
the
sill
of
their
bedroom
window
,
and
got
into
the
escape
without
falling
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
The
Professor
stated
that
the
number
of
boys
who
had
been
rescued
in
the
daytime
by
this
machine
from
houses
which
were
not
on
fire
,
was
almost
incredible
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
conflagration
had
occurred
in
the
whole
of
London
for
many
months
past
to
which
the
escape
had
not
been
carried
on
the
very
next
day
,
and
put
in
action
before
a
concourse
of
persons
.
  
<EOS>
"
THE
PRESIDENT
inquired
whether
there
was
not
some
difficulty
in
ascertaining
which
was
the
top
of
the
machine
,
and
which
the
bottom
,
in
cases
of
pressing
emergency
.
  
<EOS>
"
PROFESSOR
NOGO
explained
that
of
course
it
could
not
be
expected
to
act
quite
as
well
when
there
was
a
fire
,
as
when
there
was
not
a
fire
;
but
in
the
former
case
he
thought
it
would
be
of
equal
service
whether
the
top
were
up
or
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
the
last
section
our
correspondent
concludes
his
most
able
and
faithful
Report
,
which
will
never
cease
to
reflect
credit
upon
him
for
his
scientific
attainments
,
and
upon
us
for
our
enterprising
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
needless
to
take
a
review
of
the
subjects
which
have
been
discussed
;
of
the
mode
in
which
they
have
been
examined
;
of
the
great
truths
which
they
have
elicited
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
now
before
the
world
,
and
we
leave
them
to
read
,
to
consider
,
and
to
profit
.
  
<EOS>
The
place
of
meeting
for
next
year
has
undergone
discussion
,
and
has
at
length
been
decided
,
regard
being
had
to
,
and
evidence
being
taken
upon
,
the
goodness
of
its
wines
,
the
supply
of
its
markets
,
the
hospitality
of
its
inhabitants
,
and
the
quality
of
its
hotels
.
<EOS>
We
hope
at
this
next
meeting
our
correspondent
may
again
be
present
,
and
that
we
may
be
once
more
the
means
of
placing
his
communications
before
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Until
that
period
we
have
been
prevailed
upon
to
allow
this
number
of
our
Miscellany
to
be
retailed
to
the
public
,
or
wholesaled
to
the
trade
,
without
any
advance
upon
our
usual
price
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
only
to
add
,
that
the
committees
are
now
broken
up
,
and
that
Mudfog
is
once
again
restored
to
its
accustomed
tranquillity
,
---
that
Professors
and
Members
have
had
balls
,
and
SOIREES
,
and
suppers
,
and
great
mutual
complimentations
,
and
have
at
length
dispersed

good
wishes
and
joys
attend
them
,

Full
Report
Of
The
Second
Meeting
Of
The
Mudfog
Association
For
The
Advancement
Of
Everything
    
<EOS>
In
October
last
,
we
did
ourselves
the
immortal
credit
of
recording
,
at
an
enormous
expense
,
and
by
dint
of
exertions
unnpralleled
in
the
history
of
periodical
publication
,
the
proceedings
of
the
Mudfog
Association
for
the
Advancement
of
Everything
,
which
in
that
month
held
its
first
great
half
-
yearly
meeting
,
to
the
wonder
and
delight
of
the
whole
empire
.
 
<EOS>
We
announced
at
the
conclusion
of
that
extraordinary
and
most
remarkable
Report
,
that
when
the
Second
Meeting
of
the
Society
should
take
place
,
we
should
be
found
again
at
our
post
,
renewing
our
gigantic
and
spirited
endeavours
,
and
once
more
making
the
world
ring
with
the
accuracy
,
authenticity
,
immeasurable
superiority
,
and
intense
remarkability
of
our
account
of
its
proceedings
.
 
<EOS>
In
redemption
of
this
pledge
,
we
caused
to
be
despatched
per
steam
to
Oldcastle
(
at
which
place
this
second
meeting
of
the
Society
was
held
on
the
20th
instant
)
,
the
same
superhumanly
-
endowed
gentleman
who
furnished
the
former
report
,
and
who
,
---
gifted
by
nature
with
transcendent
abilities
,
and
furnished
by
us
with
a
body
of
assistants
scarcely
inferior
to
himself
,
---
has
forwarded
a
series
of
letters
,
which
,
for
faithfulness
of
description
,
power
of
language
,
fervour
of
thought
,
happiness
of
expression
,
and
importance
of
subject
-
matter
,
have
no
equal
in
the
epistolary
literature
of
any
age
or
country
.
 
<EOS>
We
give
this
gentleman
's
correspondence
entire
,

in
the
order
in
which
it
reached
our
office

"
When
I
left
New
Burlington
Street
this
evening
in
the
hackney
cabriolet
,
number
four
thousand
two
hundred
and
eighty
-
five
,
I
experienced
sensations
as
novel
as
they
were
oppressive
.
 
<EOS>
A
sense
of
the
importance
of
the
task
I
had
undertaken
,
a
consciousness
that
I
was
leaving
London
,
and
,
stranger
still
,
going
somewhere
else
,
a
feeling
of
loneliness
and
a
sensation
of
jolting
,
quite
bewildered
my
thoughts
,
and
for
a
time
rendered
me
even
insensible
to
the
presence
of
my
carpet
-
bag
and
hat
-
box
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
ever
feel
grateful
to
the
driver
of
a
Blackwall
omnibus
who
,
by
thrusting
the
pole
of
his
vehicle
through
the
small
door
of
the
cabriolet
,
awakened
me
from
a
tumult
of
imaginings
that
are
wholly
indescribable
.
 
<EOS>
But
of
such
materials
is
our
imperfect
nature
composed
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
happy
to
say
that
I
am
the
first
passenger
on
board
,
and
shall
thus
be
enabled
to
give
you
an
account
of
all
that
happens
in
the
order
of
its
occurrence
.
 
<EOS>
The
chimney
is
smoking
a
good
deal
,
and
so
are
the
crew
;
and
the
captain
,
I
am
informed
,
is
very
drunk
in
a
little
house
upon
deck
,
something
like
a
black
turnpike
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
infer
from
all
I
hear
that
he
has
got
the
steam
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
readily
guess
with
what
feelings
I
have
just
made
the
discovery
that
my
berth
is
in
the
same
closet
with
those
engaged
by
Professor
Woodensconce
,
Mr
Slug
,

Grime

Professor
Woodensconce

taken
the

Mr
Slug

Grime
the
two
shelves
opposite

Their
luggage
has
already
arrived

On
Mr
Slug
's
bed
is
a
long
tin
tube
of
about
three
inches
in
diameter
,
carefully
closed
at
both
ends
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
this
contain
?
 
<EOS>
Some
powerful
instrument
of
a
new
construction
,
doubtless
.

Nobody
has
yet
arrived
,
nor
has
anything
fresh
come
in
my
way
except
several
joints
of
beef
and
mutton
,
from
which
I
conclude
that
a
good
plain
dinner
has
been
provided
for
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
singular
smell
below
,
which
gave
me
some
uneasiness
at
first
;
but
as
the
steward
says
it
is
always
there
,
and
never
goes
away
,
I
am
quite
comfortable
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
learn
from
this
man
that
the
different
sections
will
be
distributed
at
the
Black
Boy
and
Stomach
-
ache
,
and
the
Boot

If
this
intelligence
be
true
(

I
have
no
reason
to
doubt
it

your
readers
will
draw
such
conclusions
as
their
different
opinions
may
suggest

I
write
down
these
remarks
as
they
occur
to
me
,
or
as
the
facts
come
to
my
knowledge

in
order
that
my
first
impressions
may
lose
nothing
of
their
original
vividness

shall
despatch
them

small
packets

The
passengers
are
pouring
in
every

<EOS>
Four
omnibuses
full
have
just
arrived
upon
the
wharf
,
and
all
is
bustle
and
activity
.
<EOS>
The
noise
and
confusion
are
very
great
.
 
<EOS>
Cloths
are
laid
in
the
cabins
,
and
the
steward
is
placing
blue
plates
---
full
of
knobs
of
cheese
at
equal
distances
down
the
centre
of
the
tables
.
 
<EOS>
He
drops
a
great
many
knobs
;
but
,
being
used
to
it
,
picks
them
up
again
with
great
dexterity
,
and
,
after
wiping
them
on
his
sleeve
,
throws
them
back
into
the
plates
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
young
man
of
exceedingly
prepossessing
appearance
---
either
dirty
or
a
mulatto
,
but
I
think
the
former
.

"
An
interesting
old
gentleman
,
who
came
to
the
wharf
in
an
omnibus
,
has
just
quarrelled
violently
with
the
porters
,
and
is
staggering
towards
the
vessel
with
a
large
trunk
in
his
arms
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
and
hope
that
he
may
reach
it
in
safety
;
but
the
board
he
has
to
cross
is
narrow
and
slippery

Was
that
a
splash
?
 
<EOS>
Gracious
powers

I
have
just
returned
from
the
deck
.
 
<EOS>
The
trunk
is
standing
upon
the
extreme
brink
of
the
wharf
,
but
the
old
gentleman
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
.
 
<EOS>
The
watchman
is
not
sure
whether
he
went
down
or
not
,
but
promises
to
drag
for
him
the
first
thing
to
-
morrow
morning
.

May
his
humane
efforts
prove
successful
!

Professor
Nogo
has
this
moment
arrived
with
his
nightcap
on
under
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
ordered
a
glass
of
cold
brandy
and
water
,
with
a
hard
biscuit
and
a
basin
,
and
has
gone
straight
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
this
mean
?
  
<EOS>
"
The
three
other
scientific
gentlemen
to
whom
I
have
already
alluded
have
come
on
board
,
and
have
all
tried
their
beds
,
with
the
exception
of
Professor
Woodensconce
,
who
sleeps
in
one
of
the
top
ones
,
and
ca
n't
get
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Slug
,
who
sleeps
in
the
other
top
one
,
is
unable
to
get
out
of
his
,
and
is
to
have
his
supper
handed
up
by
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
the
honour
to
introduce
myself
to
these
gentlemen
,
and
we
have
amicably
arranged
the
order
in
which
we
shall
retire
to
rest
;
which
it
is
necessary
to
agree
upon
,
because
,
although
the
cabin
is
very
comfortable
,
there
is
not
room
for
more
than
one
gentleman
to
be
out
of
bed
at
a
time
,
and
even
he
must
take
his
boots
off
in
the
passage
.

As
I
anticipated
,
the
knobs
of
cheese
were
provided
for
the
passengers

supper

are
now
in
course
of
consumption

Your
readers
will
be
surprised
to
hear
that
Professor
Woodensconce
has
abstained
from
cheese
for
eight
years

he
takes
butter
in
considerable
quantities

Grime
having
lost
several
teeth

is
unable

I
observe

eat
his
crusts

bottled
porter

Professors
Woodensconce

with
a
degree
of
good
humour
that
delights
us
all
,
have
just
arranged
to
toss
for
a
bottle
of
mulled
port

There
has
been
some
discussion
whether
the
payment
should
be
decided
by
the
first
toss

the
best
out
of
three

Eventually
the
latter
course
has
been
determined
on

Deeply
do
I
wish
that
both
gentlemen
could
win
;
but
that
being
impossible

I
own
that
my
personal
aspirations

individual

do
not
compromise

you

exult

to
boast
of
his
victory
in
no

measured
terms

observing
that
he
always
does

many

this

lost
to
every
feeling

decency

propriety

illuminated

light
of
a
flickering
lamp
suspended
from
the

Professor

is
lying
on
the
opposite
shelf
on
the
broad
of
his
back
,
with
his
mouth
wide
open

The
scene
is
indescribably
solemn
.

The
rippling
of
the
tide

the
noise
of
the
sailors

feet
overhead
,
the
gruff
voices
on

river

the
snoring
of

constant
creaking

excited

Mr

above

has
cautiously
withdrawn
the
curtains

,
after
looking
anxiously
out
,
as
if
to
satisfy
himself
that
his
companions

asleep

has
taken
up
the
tin
tube

I
have
before
spoken

is
regarding
it

great
interest

more

He
has
unscrewed
the
top
of

now
renews
his
observations

to
make
sure

is
clearly
on

darted
from

head
foremost

,
gaining
his
feet

all
the
rapidity

ran
wildly
into

as
an
additional

learnedly
remarks

another

point

engaged
a
donkey

chaise
shortly
after
writing
the
above

and
proceeded
at
a
brisk
trot
in
the
direction
of
Sowster

residence

passing
through
a
beautiful
expanse
of
country
,
with
red
brick
buildings
on
either
side
,
and
stopping
in
the
marketplace
to
observe
the
spot
where
Mr

hat
was
blown
off
yesterday

It
is
an
uneven
piece

has
certainly
no
appearance

would
lead
one
to
suppose
that
any
such
event
had
recently
occurred
there

this
point
I
proceeded
---
passing
the
gas

works

to
a
lane

had
been
pointed
out
to
me

the
beadle

place
of
residence

before
I
had
driven
a
dozen
yards
further

had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
Sowster
himself
advancing
towards
me

Sowster
is
a
fat
man

with
a
more
enlarged
development

that
peculiar
conformation

countenance

is
vulgarly
termed
a
double
chin
than
I
remember
to
have
ever
seen
before

He
has
also
a
very
red
nose

which
he
attributes
to
a
habit
of
early
rising
---
<EOS>
so
red
,
indeed
,
that
but
for
this
explanation
I
should
have
supposed
it
to
proceed
from
occasional
inebriety

informed
me
that
he
did
not
feel
himself
at
liberty
to
relate
what
had
passed
between
himself
and
Professor
Pumpkinskull
,
but
had
no
objection
to
state
that
it
was
connected
with

"
Mr
X

MISTY
communicated
some
remarks
on
the
disappearance
of
dancing
-
bears
from
the
streets
of
London
,
with
observations
on
the
exhibition
of
monkeys
as
connected
with
barrel
-
organs
.
 
<EOS>
The
writer
had
observed
,
with
feelings
of
the
utmost
pain
and
regret
,
that
some
years
ago
a
sudden
and
unaccountable
change
in
the
public
taste
took
place
with
reference
to
itinerant
bears
,
who
,
being
discountenanced
by
the
populace
,
gradually
fell
off
one
by
one
from
the
streets
of
the
metropolis
,
until
not
one
remained
to
create
a
taste
for
natural
history
in
the
breasts
of
the
poor
and
uninstructed
.
 
<EOS>
One
bear
,
indeed
,
---
a
brown
and
ragged
animal
,
---
had
lingered
about
the
haunts
of
his
former
triumphs
,
with
a
worn
and
dejected
visage
and
feeble
limbs
,
and
had
essayed
to
wield
his
quarter
-
staff
for
the
amusement
of
the
multitude
;
but
hunger
,
and
an
utter
want
of
any
due
recompense
for
his
abilities
,
had
at
length
driven
him
from
the
field
,
and
it
was
only
too
probable
that
he
had
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
the
rising
taste
for
grease
.
 
<EOS>
He
regretted
to
add
that
a
similar
,
and
no
less
lamentable
,
change
had
taken
place
with
reference
to
monkeys
.
 
<EOS>
These
delightful
animals
had
formerly
been
almost
as
plentiful
as
the
organs
on
the
tops
of
which
they
were
accustomed
to
sit
;
the
proportion
in
the
year
1829
(
it
appeared
by
the
parliamentary
return
)
being
as
one
monkey
to
three
organs
.
 
<EOS>
Owing
,
however
,
to
an
altered
taste
in
musical
instruments
,
and
the
substitution
,
in
a
great
measure
,
of
narrow
boxes
of
music
for
organs
,
which
left
the
monkeys
nothing
to
sit
upon
,
this
source
of
public
amusement
was
wholly
dried
up
.
<EOS>
Considering
it
a
matter
of
the
deepest
importance
,
in
connection
with
national
education
,
that
the
people
should
not
lose
such
opportunities
of
making
themselves
acquainted
with
the
manners
and
customs
of
two
most
interesting
species
of
animals
,
the
author
submitted
that
some
measures
should
be
immediately
taken
for
the
restoration
of
these
pleasing
and
truly
intellectual
amusements
.
  
<EOS>
"
THE
PRESIDENT
inquired
by
what
means
the
honourable
member
proposed
to
attain
this
most
desirable
end
?
  
<EOS>
"
THE
AUTHOR
submitted
that
it
could
be
most
fully
and
satisfactorily
accomplished
,
if
Her
Majesty
's
Government
would
cause
to
be
brought
over
to
England
,
and
maintained
at
the
public
expense
,
and
for
the
public
amusement
,
such
a
number
of
bears
as
would
enable
every
quarter
of
the
town
to
be
visited
---
say
at
least
by
three
bears
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
No
difficulty
whatever
need
be
experienced
in
providing
a
fitting
place
for
the
reception
of
these
animals
,
as
a
commodious
bear
-
garden
could
be
erected
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
both
Houses
of
Parliament
;
obviously
the
most
proper
and
eligible
spot
for
such
an
establishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
PROFESSOR
MULL
doubted
very
much
whether
any
correct
ideas
of
natural
history
were
propagated
by
the
means
to
which
the
honourable
member
had
so
ably
adverted
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
he
believed
that
they
had
been
the
means
of
diffusing
very
incorrect
and
imperfect
notions
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
from
personal
observation
and
personal
experience
,
when
he
said
that
many
children
of
great
abilities
had
been
induced
to
believe
,
from
what
they
had
observed
in
the
streets
,
at
and
before
the
period
to
which
the
honourable
gentleman
had
referred
,
that
all
monkeys
were
born
in
red
coats
and
spangles
,
and
that
their
hats
and
feathers
also
came
by
nature
.
 
<EOS>
He
wished
to
know
distinctly
whether
the
honourable
gentleman
attributed
the
want
of
encouragement
the
bears
had
met
with
to
the
decline
of
public
taste
in
that
respect
,
or
to
a
want
of
ability
on
the
part
of
the
bears
themselves
?
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
X
X
MISTY
replied
,
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
but
that
there
must
be
a
great
deal
of
floating
talent
among
the
bears
and
monkeys
generally
;
which
,
in
the
absence
of
any
proper
encouragement
,
was
dispersed
in
other
directions
.
  
<EOS>
"
PROFESSOR
PUMPKINSKULL
wished
to
take
that
opportunity
of
calling
the
attention
of
the
section
to
a
most
important
and
serious
point
.
<EOS>
The
author
of
the
treatise
just
read
had
alluded
to
the
prevalent
taste
for
bears'-grease
as
a
means
of
promoting
the
growth
of
hair
,
which
undoubtedly
was
diffused
to
a
very
great
<EOS>
and
(
as
it
appeared
to
him
)
very
alarming
extent
.
 
<EOS>
No
gentleman
attending
that
section
could
fail
to
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
youth
of
the
present
age
evinced
,
by
their
behaviour
in
the
streets
,
and
at
all
places
of
public
resort
,
a
considerable
lack
of
that
gallantry
and
gentlemanly
feeling
which
,
in
more
ignorant
times
,
had
been
thought
becoming
.
 
<EOS>
He
wished
to
know
whether
it
were
possible
that
a
constant
outward
application
of
bears'-grease
by
the
young
gentlemen
about
town
had
imperceptibly
infused
into
those
unhappy
persons
something
of
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
bear
.
 
<EOS>
He
shuddered
as
he
threw
out
the
remark
;
but
if
this
theory
,
on
inquiry
,
should
prove
to
be
well
founded
,
it
would
at
once
explain
a
great
deal
of
unpleasant
eccentricity
of
behaviour
,
which
,
without
some
such
discovery
,
was
wholly
unaccountable
.
  
<EOS>
"
THE
PRESIDENT
highly
complimented
the
learned
gentleman
on
his
most
valuable
suggestion
,
which
produced
the
greatest
effect
upon
the
assembly
;
and
remarked
that
only
a
week
previous
he
had
seen
some
young
gentlemen
at
a
theatre
eyeing
a
box
of
ladies
with
a
fierce
intensity
,
which
nothing
but
the
influence
of
some
brutish
appetite
could
possibly
explain
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
dreadful
to
reflect
that
our
youth
were
so
rapidly
verging
into
a
generation
of
bears
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
a
scene
of
scientific
enthusiasm
it
was
resolved
that
this
important
question
should
be
immediately
submitted
to
the
consideration
of
the
council
.
  
<EOS>
"
THE
PRESIDENT
wished
to
know
whether
any
gentleman
could
inform
the
section
what
had
become
of
the
dancing
-
dogs
?
  
<EOS>
"
A
MEMBER
replied
,
after
some
hesitation
,
that
on
the
day
after
three
glee
-
singers
had
been
committed
to
prison
as
criminals
by
a
late
most
zealous
police
-
magistrate
of
the
metropolis
,
the
dogs
had
abandoned
their
professional
duties
,
and
dispersed
themselves
in
different
quarters
of
the
town
to
gain
a
livelihood
by
less
dangerous
means
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
given
to
understand
that
since
that
period
they
had
supported
themselves
by
lying
in
wait
for
and
robbing
blind
men
's
poodles
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
FLUMMERY
exhibited
a
twig
,
claiming
to
be
a
veritable
branch
of
that
noble
tree
known
to
naturalists
as
the
SHAKSPEARE
,
which
has
taken
root
in
every
land
and
climate
,
and
gathered
under
the
shade
of
its
broad
green
boughs
the
great
family
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
The
learned
gentleman
remarked
that
the
twig
had
been
undoubtedly
called
by
other
names
in
its
time
;
but
that
it
had
been
pointed
out
to
him
by
an
old
lady
in
Warwickshire
,
where
the
great
tree
had
grown
,
as
a
shoot
of
the
genuine
SHAKSPEARE
,
by
which
name
he
begged
to
introduce
it
to
his
countrymen
.
  
<EOS>
"
THE
PRESIDENT
wished
to
know
what
botanical
definition
<EOS>
the
honourable
gentleman
could
afford
of
the
curiosity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
FLUMMERY
expressed
his
opinion
that
it
was

Mr
CRINKLES
exhibited
a
most
beautiful
and
delicate
machine
,
of
little
larger
size
than
an
ordinary
snuff
-
box
,
manufactured
entirely
by
himself
,
and
composed
exclusively
of
steel
,
by
the
aid
of
which
more
pockets

by
the

slow

tedious
process
in

and

twenty
.
 
<EOS>
The
inventor
remarked
that
it
had
been
put
into
active
operation
in
Fleet
Street
,
the
Strand
,
and
other
thoroughfares
,
and
had
never
been
once
known
to
fail

After
some
slight
delay
,
occasioned
by
the
various
members
of

section
buttoning
their
pockets
,
  
"
THE
PRESIDENT
narrowly
inspected
the
invention
,
and
declared
that
he
had
never
seen
a
machine
of
more
beautiful
or
exquisite
construction
.
 
<EOS>
Would
the
inventor
be
good
enough
to
inform
the
section
whether
he
had
taken
any
and
what
means
for
bringing
it
into
general
operation
?
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
CRINKLES
stated
that
,
after
encountering
some
preliminary
difficulties
,
he
had
succeeded
in
putting
himself
in
communication
with
Mr
Fogle
Hunter
,
and
other
gentlemen
connected
with
the
swell
mob
,
who
had
awarded
the
invention
the
very
highest
and
most
unqualified
approbation
.
 
<EOS>
He
regretted
to
say
,
however
,
that
these
distinguished
practitioners
,
in
common
with
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
Gimlet
-
eyed
Tommy
,
and
other
members
of
a
secondary
grade
of
the
profession
whom
he
was
understood
to
represent
,
entertained
an
insuperable
objection
to
its
being
brought
into
general
use
,
on
the
ground
that
it
would
have
the
inevitable
effect
of
almost
entirely
superseding
manual
labour
,
and
throwing
a
great
number
of
highly
-
deserving
persons
out
of
employment
.
  
<EOS>
"
THE
PRESIDENT
hoped
that
no
such
fanciful
objections
would
be
allowed
to
stand
in
the
way
of
such
a
great
public
improvement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
CRINKLES
hoped
so
too
;
but
he
feared
that
if
the
gentlemen
of
the
swell
mob
persevered
in
their
objection
,
nothing
could
be
done
.
  
<EOS>
"
PROFESSOR
GRIME
suggested
,
that
surely
,
in
that
case
,
Her
Majesty
's
Government
might
be
prevailed
upon
to
take
it
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
CRINKLES
said
,
that
if
the
objection
were
found
to
be
insuperable
he
should
apply
to
Parliament
,
which
he
thought
could
not
fail
to
recognise
the
utility
of
the
invention
.
  
<EOS>
"
THE
PRESIDENT
observed
that
,
up
to
this
time
Parliament
had
certainly
got
on
very
well
without
it
;
but
,
as
they
did
their
business
on
a
very
large
scale
,
he
had
no
doubt
they
would
gladly
adopt
the
improvement
.
 
<EOS>
His
only
fear
was
that
the
machine
might
be
worn
out
by
constant
working
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
COPPERNOSE
called
the
attention
of
the
section
to
a
proposition
of
great
magnitude
and
interest
,
illustrated
by
a
vast
number
of
models
,
and
stated
with
much
clearness
and
perspicuity
in
a
treatise
entitled
"
Practical
Suggestions
on
the
necessity
of
providing
some
harmless
and
wholesome
relaxation
for
the
young
noblemen
of
England
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
proposition
was
,
that
a
space
of
ground
of
not
less
than
ten
miles
in
length
and
four
in
breadth
should
be
purchased
by
a
new
company
,
to
be
incorporated
by
Act
of
Parliament
,
and
inclosed
by
a
brick
wall
of
not
less
than
twelve
feet
in
height
.
 
<EOS>
He
proposed
that
it
should
be
laid
out
with
highway
roads
,
turnpikes
,
bridges
,
miniature
villages
,
and
every
object
that
could
conduce
to
the
comfort
and
glory
of
Four
-
in
-
hand
Clubs
,
so
that
they
might
be
fairly
presumed
to
require
no
drive
beyond
it
.
 
<EOS>
This
delightful
retreat
would
be
fitted
up
with
most
commodious
and
extensive
stables
,
for
the
convenience
of
such
of
the
nobility
and
gentry
as
had
a
taste
for
ostlering
,
and
with
houses
of
entertainment
furnished
in
the
most
expensive
and
handsome
style
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
further
provided
with
whole
streets
of
door
-
knockers
and
bell
-
handles
of
extra
size
,
so
constructed
that
they
could
be
easily
wrenched
off
at
night
,
and
regularly
screwed
on
again
,
by
attendants
provided
for
the
purpose
,
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
There
would
also
be
gas
lamps
of
real
glass
,
which
could
be
broken
at
a
comparatively
small
expense
per
dozen
,
and
a
broad
and
handsome
foot
pavement
for
gentlemen
to
drive
their
cabriolets
upon
when
they
were
humorously
disposed
---
for
the
full
enjoyment
of
which
feat
live
pedestrians
would
be
procured
from
the
workhouse
at
a
very
small
charge
per
head
.
 
<EOS>
The
place
being
inclosed
,
and
carefully
screened
from
the
intrusion
of
the
public
,
there
would
be
no
objection
to
gentlemen
laying
aside
any
article
of
their
costume
that
was
considered
to
interfere
with
a
pleasant
frolic
,
or
,
indeed
,
to
their
walking
about
without
any
costume
at
all
,
if
they
liked
that
better
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
every
facility
of
enjoyment
would
be
afforded
that
the
most
gentlemanly
person
could
possibly
desire
.
<EOS>
But
as
even
these
advantages
would
be
incomplete
unless
there
were
some
means
provided
of
enabling
the
nobility
and
gentry
to
display
their
prowess
when
they
sallied
forth
after
dinner
,
and
as
some
inconvenience
might
be
experienced
in
the
event
of
their
being
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
pummelling
each
other
,
the
inventor
had
turned
his
attention
to
the
construction
of
an
entirely
new
police
force
,
composed
exclusively
of
automaton
figures
,
which
,
with
the
assistance
of
the
ingenious
Signor
Gagliardi
,
of
Windmill
-
street
,
in
the
Haymarket
,
he
had
succeeded
in
making
with
such
nicety
,
that
a
policeman
,
cab
-
driver
,
or
old
woman
,
made
upon
the
principle
of
the
models
exhibited
,
would
walk
about
until
knocked
down
like
any
real
man
;
nay
,
more
,
if
set
upon
and
beaten
by
six
or
eight
noblemen
or
gentlemen
,
after
it
was
down
,
the
figure
would
utter
divers
groans
,
mingled
with
entreaties
for
mercy
,
thus
rendering
the
illusion
complete
,
and
the
enjoyment
perfect
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
invention
did
not
stop
even
here
;
for
station
-
houses
would
be
built
,
containing
good
beds
for
noblemen
and
gentlemen
during
the
night
,
and
in
the
morning
they
would
repair
to
a
commodious
police
office
,
where
a
pantomimic
investigation
would
take
place
before
the
automaton
magistrates
,
---
quite
equal
to
life
,
---
who
would
fine
them
in
so
many
counters
,
with
which
they
would
be
previously
provided
for
the
purpose

This
office
would
be
furnished
with
an
inclined
plane
,
for
the
convenience
of
any
nobleman
or
gentleman
who
might
wish
to
bring
in
his
horse
as
a
witness
;
and
the
prisoners
would
be
at
perfect
liberty
,

to
interrupt
the
complainants
as
much
as
they
pleased
,

to
make
any
remarks
that
they
thought
proper
.
 
<EOS>
The
charge
for
these
amusements
would
amount
to
very
little
more
than
they
already
cost
,

the
inventor
submitted
that
the
public
would
be
much
benefited
and
comforted
by
the
proposed
arrangement

"
PROFESSOR
NOGO
wished
to
be
informed
what
amount
of
automaton
police
force
<EOS>
it
was
proposed
to
raise
in
the
first
instance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
COPPERNOSE
replied
,
that
it
was
proposed
to
begin
with
seven
divisions
of
police
of
a
score
each
,
lettered
from
A^
to
G^
inclusive
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
proposed
that
not
more
than
half
this
number
should
be
placed
on
active
duty
,
and
that
the
remainder
should
be
kept
on
shelves
in
the
police
office
ready
to
be
called
out
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
  
<EOS>
"
THE
PRESIDENT
,
awarding
the
utmost
merit
to
the
ingenious
gentleman
who
had
originated
the
idea
,
doubted
whether
the
automaton
police
would
quite
answer
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
He
feared
that
noblemen
and
gentlemen
would
perhaps
require
the
excitement
of
thrashing
living
subjects
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
COPPERNOSE
submitted
,
that
as
the
usual
odds
in
such
cases
were
ten
noblemen
or
gentlemen
to
one
policeman
or
cab
-
driver
,
it
could
make
very
little
difference
in
point
of
excitement
whether
the
policeman
or
cab
-
driver
were
a
man
or
a
block
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
advantage
would
be
,
that
a
policeman
's
limbs
might
be
all
knocked
off
,
and
yet
he
would
be
in
a
condition
to
do
duty
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
even
give
his
evidence
next
morning
with
his
head
in
his
hand
,
and
give
it
equally
well
.

Will

one
objection

<EOS>
It
appears
to
me
that

to
talk

<EOS>
"
Mr
COPPERNOSE
no
sooner
heard
this
suggestion
than
he
touched
a
small
spring
in
each
of
the
two
models
of
magistrates
which
were
placed
upon
the
table
;
one
of
the
figures
immediately
began
to
exclaim
with
great
volubility
that
he
was
sorry
to
see
gentlemen
in
such
a
situation
,
and
the
other
to
express
a
fear
that
the
policeman
was
intoxicated
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
section
,
as
with
one
accord
,
declared
with
a
shout
of
applause
that
the
invention
was
complete
;
and
the
President
,
much
excited
,
retired
with
Mr
Coppernose
to
lay
it
before
the
council
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
return
,
  
"
Mr
TICKLE
displayed
his
newly

invented
spectacles
,
which
enabled
the
wearer
to
discern
,
in
very
bright
colours
,
<EOS>
objects
at
a
great
distance
,
and
rendered
him
wholly
blind
to
those
immediately
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
,
he
said
,
a
most
valuable
and
useful
invention
,
based
strictly
upon
the
principle
of
the
human
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
THE
PRESIDENT
required
some
information
upon
this
point
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
yet
to
learn
that
the
human
eye
was
remarkable
for
the
peculiarities
of
which
the
honourable
gentleman
had
spoken
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
TICKLE
was
rather
astonished
to
hear
this
,
when
the
President
could
not
fail
to
be
aware
that
a
large
number
of
most
excellent
persons
and
great
statesmen
could
see
,
with
the
naked
eye
,
most
marvellous
horrors
on
West
India
plantations
,
while
they
could
discern
nothing
<EOS>
whatever
in
the
interior
of
Manchester
cotton
mills
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
know
,
too
,
with
what
quickness
of
perception
most
people
could
discover
their
neighbour
's
faults
,
and
how
very
blind
they
were
to
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
President
differed
from
the
great
majority
of
men
in
this
respect
,
his
eye
was
a
defective
one
,
and
it
was
to
assist
his
vision
that
these
glasses
were
made

Dr

stated
to
the
section
a
most
interesting
case
of
monomania
,
and
described
the
course
of
treatment
he
had
pursued
with
perfect
success
.
 
<EOS>
The
patient
was
a
married
lady
in
the
middle
rank
of
life
,
who
,
having
seen
another
lady
at
an
evening
party
in
a
full
suit
of
pearls
,
was
suddenly
seized
with
a
desire
to
possess
a
similar
equipment
,
although
her
husband
's
finances
were
by
no
means
equal
to
the
necessary
outlay
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
her
wish
ungratified
,
she
fell
sick
,
and
the
symptoms
soon
became
so
alarming
,
that
he
(
Dr
Grummidge
)
was
called
in
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
period
the
prominent
tokens
of
the
disorder
were
sullenness
,
a
total
indisposition
to
perform
domestic
duties
,
great
peevishness
,
and
extreme
languor
,
except
when
pearls
were
mentioned
,
at
which
times
the
pulse
quickened
,
the
eyes
grew
brighter
,
the
pupils
dilated
,
and
the
patient
,
after
various
incoherent
exclamations
,
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
,
and
exclaimed
that
nobody
cared
for
her
,
and
that
she
wished
herself
dead
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
that
the
patient
's
appetite
was
affected
in
the
presence
of
company
,
he
began
by
ordering
a
total
abstinence
from
all
stimulants
,
and
forbidding
any
sustenance
but
weak
gruel
;
he
then
took
twenty
ounces
of
blood
,
applied
a
blister
under
each
ear
,
one
upon
the
chest
,
and
another
on
the
back
;
having
done
which
,
and
administered
five
grains
of
calomel
,
he
left
the
patient
to
her
repose
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
day
she
was
somewhat
low
,
but
decidedly
better
,
and
all
appearances
of
irritation
were
removed
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
day
she
improved
still
further
,
and
on
the
next
again
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
fourth
there
was
some
appearance
of
a
return
of
the
old
symptoms
,
which
no
sooner
developed
themselves
,
than
he
administered
another
dose
of
calomel
,
and
left
strict
orders
that
,
unless
a
decidedly
favourable
change
occurred
within
two
hours
,
the
patient
's
head
should
be
immediately
shaved
to
the
very
last
curl
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
moment
she
began
to
mend
,
and
,
in
less
than
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
was
perfectly
restored
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
now
betray
the
least
emotion
at
the
sight
or
mention
of
pearls
or
any
other
ornaments
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
cheerful
and
good
-
humoured
,
and
a
most
beneficial
change
had
been
effected
in
her
whole
temperament
and
condition

Mr
PIPKIN
(
M
R
C

)
read
a
short
but
most
interesting
communication
in
which
he
sought
to
prove
the
complete
belief
of
Sir
William
Courtenay
,
otherwise
Thorn
,
recently
shot
at
Canterbury
,
in
the
Homoeopathic
system
.
 
<EOS>
The
section
would
bear
in
mind
that
one
of
the
Homoeopathic
doctrines
was
,
that
infinitesimal
doses
of
any
medicine
which
would
occasion
the
disease
under
which
the
patient
laboured
,
supposing
him
to
be
in
a
healthy
state
,
would
cure
it
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
it
was
a
remarkable
circumstance
---
proved
in
the
evidence
---
that
the
deceased
Thorn
employed
a
woman
to
follow
him
about
all
day
with
a
pail
of
water
,
assuring
her
that
one
drop
(
a
purely
homoeopathic
remedy
,
the
section
would
observe
)
,
placed
upon
his
tongue
,
after
death
,
would
restore
him
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
the
obvious
inference
?
 
<EOS>
That
Thorn
,
who
was
marching
and
countermarching
in
osier
beds
,
and
other
swampy
places
,
was
impressed
with
a
presentiment
that
he
should
be
drowned
;
in
which
case
,
had
his
instructions
been
complied
with
,
he
could
not
fail
to
have
been
brought
to
life
again
instantly
by
his
own
prescription
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
if
this
woman
,
or
any
other
person
,
had
administered
an
infinitesimal
dose
of
lead
and
gunpowder
immediately
after
he
fell
,
he
would
have
recovered
forthwith
.
 
<EOS>
But
unhappily
the
woman
concerned
did
not
possess
the
power
of
reasoning
by
analogy
,
or
carrying
out
a
principle
,
and
thus
the
unfortunate
gentleman
had
been
sacrificed
to
the
ignorance
of
the
peasantry

Mr

stated
the
result

some
most
ingenious
statistical
inquiries
relative
to
the
difference
between
the
value
of
the
qualification
of
several
members
of
Parliament
as
published
to
the
world
,
and
its
real
nature
and
amount
.
 
<EOS>
After
reminding
the
section
that
every
member
of
Parliament
for
a
town
or
borough
was
supposed
to
possess
a
clear
freehold
estate
of
three
hundred
pounds
per
annum
,
the
honourable
gentleman
excited
great
amusement
and
laughter
by
stating
the
exact
amount
of
freehold
property
possessed
by
a
column
of
legislators
,
in
which
he
had
included
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
from
this
table
,
that
the
amount
of
such
income
possessed
by
each
was
0
pounds
,
0
shillings
,
and
0
pence
,
yielding
an
average
of
the
same
.

Great

It
was
pretty
well

temporary

to
the
ownership
of
which
they
swore
solemnly
---
of

as
a

matter

He
argued
from
these
DATA
that
it

wholly
unnecessary
for

of

to
possess
any
property
at
all
,
especially
as

A
paper
was
read
by
the
secretary
descriptive
of
a
bay
pony
with
one
eye
,
which
had
been
seen
by
the
author
standing
in
a
butcher
's
cart
at
the
corner
of
Newgate
Market
.
 
<EOS>
The
communication
described
the
author
of
the
paper
as
having
,
in
the
prosecution
of
a
mercantile
pursuit
,
betaken
himself
one
Saturday
morning
last
summer
from
Somers
Town
to
Cheapside
;
in
the
course
of
which
expedition
<EOS>
he
had
beheld
the
extraordinary
appearance
above
described
.
 
<EOS>
The
pony
had
one
distinct
eye
,
and
it
had
been
pointed
out
to
him
by
his
friend
Captain
Blunderbore
,
of
the
Horse
Marines
,
who
assisted
the
author
in
his
search
,
that
whenever
he
winked
this
eye
he
whisked
his
tail
(
possibly
to
drive
the
flies
off
)
,
but
that
he
always
winked
and
whisked
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
animal
was
lean
,
spavined
,
and
tottering
;
and
the
author
proposed
to
constitute
it
of
the
family
of
FITFORDOGSMEATAURIOUS
.
 
<EOS>
It
certainly
did
occur
to
him
that
there
was
no
case
on
record
of
a
pony
with
one
clearly
-
defined
and
distinct
organ
of
vision
,
winking
and
whisking
at
the
same
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Q
J
SNUFFLETOFFLE
had
heard
of
a
pony
winking
his
eye
,
and
likewise
of
a
pony
whisking
his
tail
,
but
whether
they
were
two
ponies
or
the
same
pony
he
could
not
undertake
positively
to
say
.
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
he
was
acquainted
with
no
authenticated
instance
of
a
simultaneous
winking
and
whisking
,
and
he
really
could
not
but
doubt
the
existence
of
such
a
marvellous
pony
in
opposition
to
all
those
natural
laws
by
which
ponies
were
governed
.
 
<EOS>
Referring
,
however
,
to
the
mere
question
of
his
one
organ
of
vision
,
might
he
suggest
the
possibility
of
this
pony
having
been
literally
half
asleep
at
the
time
he
was
seen
,
and
having
closed
only
one
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
THE
PRESIDENT
observed
that
,
whether
the
pony
was
half
asleep
or
fast
asleep
,
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
association
was
wide
awake
,
and
therefore
that
they
had
better
get
the
business
over
,
and
go
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
certainly
never
seen
anything
analogous
to
this
pony
,
but
he
was
not
prepared
to
doubt
its
existence
;
for
he
had
seen
many
queerer
ponies
in
his
time
,
though
he
did
not
pretend
to
have
seen
any
more
remarkable
donkeys
than
the
other
gentlemen
around
him
.

the
real

Mr

With
these
words
,
Professor
Ketch
hastily
repossessed
himself
of
the
cocoa
-
nut
,
and
drew
forth
the
skull
,
in
mistake
for
which
he
had
exhibited
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
most
interesting
conversation
ensued
;
but
as
there
appeared
some
doubt
ultimately
whether
the
skull
was
Mr
Greenacre
's
,
or
a
hospital
patient

,
or
a
pauper

,
or
a

no

obtained

<EOS>
"
I

says
our
talented
correspondent
in
conclusion
,
"
I
can
not
close
my
account
of
these
gigantic
researches
and
sublime
and
noble
triumphs
without
repeating
a
BON
MOT
of
Professor
Woodensconce
's
,
which
shows
how
the
greatest
minds
may
occasionally
unbend
when
truth
can
be
presented
to
listening
ears
,
clothed
in
an
attractive
and
playful
form
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
standing
by
,
when
,
after
a
week
of
feasting
and
feeding
,
that
learned
gentleman
,
accompanied
by
the
whole
body
of
wonderful
men
,
entered
the
hall
yesterday
,
where
a
sumptuous
dinner
was
prepared
;
where
the
richest
wines
sparkled
on
the
board
,
and
fat
bucks
---
propitiatory
sacrifices
to
learning
---
sent
forth
their
savoury
odours
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah

said
Professor
Woodensconce

rubbing
his
hands
,
"
this
is
what
we
meet
for

this
is
what
inspires
us

this
is
what
keeps
us
together

beckons
us
onward

glorious

<EOS>
The
Pantomime
Of
Life
    
<EOS>
Before
we
plunge
headlong
into
this
paper
,
let
us
at
once
confess
to
a
fondness
for
pantomimes
---
to
a
gentle
sympathy
with
clowns
and
pantaloons
---
to
an
unqualified
admiration
of
harlequins
and
columbines
---
to
a
chaste
delight
in
every
action
of
their
brief
existence
,
varied
and
many
-
coloured
as
those
actions
are
,
and
inconsistent
though
they
occasionally
be
with
those
rigid
and
formal
rules
of
propriety
which
regulate
the
proceedings
of
meaner
and
less
comprehensive
minds
.
 
<EOS>
We
revel
in
pantomimes
---
not
because
they
dazzle
one
's
eyes
with
tinsel
and
gold
leaf
;
not
because
they
present
to
us
,
once
again
,
the
well
-
beloved
chalked
faces
,
and
goggle
eyes
of
our
childhood
;
not
even
because
,
like
Christmas
-
day
,
and
Twelfth
-
night
,
and
Shrove
-
Tuesday
,
and
one
's
own
birthday
,
they
come
to
us
but
once
a
year
;
---
our
attachment
is
founded
on
a
graver
and
a
very
different
reason
.
 
<EOS>
A
pantomime
is
to
us
,
a
mirror
of
life
;
nay
,
more
,
we
maintain
that
it
is
so
to
audiences
generally
,
although
they
are
not
aware
of
it
,
and
that
this
very
circumstance
is
the
secret
cause
of
their
amusement
and
delight
.
  
<EOS>
Let
us
take
a
slight
example
.
 
<EOS>
The
scene
is
a
street
:
 
an
elderly
gentleman
,
with
a
large
face
and
strongly
marked
features
,
appears
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
beams
with
a
sunny
smile
,
and
a
perpetual
dimple
is
on
his
broad
,
red
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
evidently
an
opulent
elderly
gentleman
,
comfortable
in
circumstances
,
and
well
-
to
-
do
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
unmindful
of
the
adornment
of
his
person
,
for
he
is
richly
,
not
to
say
gaudily
,
dressed
;
and
that
he
indulges
to
a
reasonable
extent
in
the
pleasures
of
the
table
may
be
inferred
from
the
joyous
and
oily
manner
in
which
he
rubs
his
stomach
,
by
way
of
informing
the
audience
that
he
is
going
home
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
fulness
of
his
heart
,
in
the
fancied
security
of
wealth
,
in
the
possession
and
enjoyment
of
all
the
good
things
of
life
,
the
elderly
gentleman
suddenly
loses
his
footing
,
and
stumbles
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
audience
roar
!
 
<EOS>
He
is
set
upon
by
a
noisy
and
officious
crowd
,
who
buffet
and
cuff
him
unmercifully
.
 
<EOS>
They
scream
with
delight
!
<EOS>
Every
time
the
elderly
gentleman
struggles
to
get
up
,
his
relentless
persecutors
knock
him
down
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
spectators
are
convulsed
with
merriment
!
 
<EOS>
And
when
at
last
the
elderly
gentleman
does
get
up
,
and
staggers
away
,
despoiled
of
hat
,
wig
,
and
clothing
,
himself
battered
to
pieces
,
and
his
watch
and
money
gone
,
they
are
exhausted
with
laughter
,
and
express
their
merriment
and
admiration
in
rounds
of
applause
.
  
<EOS>
Is
this
like
life
?
 
<EOS>
Change
the
scene
to
any
real
street
;
---
to
the
Stock
Exchange
,
or
the
City
banker
's
;
the
merchant
's
counting
-
house
,
or
even
the
tradesman
's
shop
.
 
<EOS>
See
any
one
of
these
men
fall
,
---
the
more
suddenly
,
and
the
nearer
the
zenith
of
his
pride
and
riches
,
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
wild
hallo
is
raised
over
his
prostrate
carcase
by
the
shouting
mob
;
how
they
whoop
and
yell
as
he
lies
humbled
beneath
them
!
 
<EOS>
Mark
<EOS>
how
eagerly
they
set
upon
him
when
he
is
down
;
and
how
they
mock
and
deride
him
as
he
slinks
away
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
it
is
the
pantomime
to
the
very
letter
.
  
<EOS>
Of
all
the
pantomimic
DRAMATIS
PERSONAE
,
we
consider
the
pantaloon
the
most
worthless
and
debauched
.
 
<EOS>
Independent
of
the
dislike
one
naturally
feels
at
seeing
a
gentleman
of
his
years
engaged
in
pursuits
highly
unbecoming
his
gravity
and
time
of
life
,
we
can
not
conceal
from
ourselves
the
fact
that
he
is
a
treacherous
,
worldly
-
minded
old
villain
,
constantly
enticing
his
younger
companion
,
the
clown
,
into
acts
of
fraud
or
petty
larceny
,
and
generally
standing
aside
to
watch
the
result
of
the
enterprise
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
be
successful
,
he
never
forgets
to
return
for
his
share
of
the
spoil
;
but
if
it
turn
out
a
failure
,
he
generally
retires
with
remarkable
caution
and
expedition
,
and
keeps
carefully
aloof
until
the
affair
has
blown
over
.
 
<EOS>
His
amorous
propensities
,
too
,
are
eminently
disagreeable
;
and
his
mode
of
addressing
ladies
in
the
open
street
at
noon
-
day
is
down
-
right
improper
,
being
usually
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
perceptible
tickling
of
the
aforesaid
ladies
in
the
waist
,
after
committing
which
<EOS>
,
he
starts
back
,
manifestly
ashamed
(
<EOS>
as
well
he
may
be
)
of
his
own
indecorum
and
temerity
;
continuing
,
nevertheless
,
to
ogle
and
beckon
to
them
from
a
distance
in
a
very
unpleasant
and
immoral
manner
.
  
<EOS>
Is
there
any
man
who
can
not
count
a
dozen
pantaloons
in
his
own
social
circle
?
 
<EOS>
Is
there
any
man
who
has
not
seen
them
swarming
at
the
west
end
of
the
town
on
a
sunshiny
day
or
a
summer
's
evening
,
going
through
the
last
-
named
pantomimic
feats
with
as
much
liquorish
energy
,
and
as
total
an
absence
of
reserve
,
as
if
they
were
on
the
very
stage
itself
?
 
<EOS>
We
can
tell
upon
our
fingers
a
dozen
pantaloons
of
our
acquaintance
at
this
moment
---
capital
pantaloons
,
who
have
been
performing
all
kinds
of
strange
freaks
,
to
the
great
amusement
of
their
friends
and
acquaintance
,
for
years
past
;
and
who
to
this
day
are
making
such
comical
and
ineffectual
attempts
to
be
young
and
dissolute
,
that
all
beholders
are
like
to
die
with
laughter
.
  
<EOS>
Take
that
old
gentleman
who
has
just
emerged
from
the
CAFE
DE
L'EUROPE
in
the
Haymarket
,
where
he
has
been
dining
at
the
expense
of
the
young
man
upon
town
with
whom
he
shakes
hands
as
they
part
at
the
door
of
the
tavern
.
 
<EOS>
The
affected
warmth
of
that
shake
of
the
hand
,
the
courteous
nod
,
the
obvious
recollection
of
the
dinner
,
the
savoury
flavour
of
which
still
hangs
upon
his
lips
,
are
all
characteristics
of
his
great
prototype
.
 
<EOS>
He
hobbles
away
humming
an
opera
tune
,
and
twirling
his
cane
to
and
fro
,
with
affected
carelessness
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
stops
---
'
tis
at
the
milliner
's
window
.
 
<EOS>
He
peeps
through
one
of
the
large
panes
of
glass
;
and
,
his
view
of
the
ladies
within
being
obstructed
by
the
India
shawls
,
directs
his
attentions
to
the
young
girl
with
the
band
-
box
in
her
hand
,
who
is
gazing
in
at
the
window
also
.
 
<EOS>
See
!
<EOS>
he
draws
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
coughs
;
she
turns
away
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
draws
near
her
again
;
she
disregards
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
gleefully
chucks
her
under
the
chin
,
and
,
retreating
a
few
steps
,
nods
and
beckons
with
fantastic
grimaces
,
while
the
girl
bestows
a
contemptuous
and
supercilious
look
upon
his
wrinkled
visage
.
 
<EOS>
She
turns
away
with
a
flounce
,
and
the
old
gentleman
trots
after
her
with
a
toothless
chuckle
.
<EOS>
The
pantaloon
to
the
life
!
   
<EOS>
But
the
close
resemblance
which
the
clowns
of
the
stage
bear
to
those
of
every
-
day
life
is
perfectly
extraordinary
.
 
<EOS>
Some
people
talk
with
a
sigh
of
the
decline
of
pantomime
,
and
murmur
in
low
and
dismal
tones
the
name
of
Grimaldi
.
 
<EOS>
We
mean
no
disparagement
to
the
worthy
and
excellent
old
man
when
we
say
that
this
is
downright
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
Clowns
that
beat
Grimaldi
all
to
nothing
turn
up
every
day
,
and
nobody
patronizes
them
---
more
's
the
pity
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
who
you
mean
,
"
says
some
dirty
-
faced
patron
of
Mr
Osbaldistone
's
,
laying
down
the
Miscellany
when
he
has
got
thus
far
,
and
bestowing
upon
vacancy
a
most
knowing
glance
;
"
you
mean
C
J
Smith
as
did
Guy
Fawkes
,
and
George
Barnwell
at
the
Garden
.
<EOS>
"
The
dirty
-
faced
gentleman
has
hardly
uttered
the
words
,
when
he
is
interrupted
by
a
young
gentleman
in
no
shirt
-
collar
and
a
Petersham
coat
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
says
the
young
gentleman
;
"
he
means
Brown
,
King
,
and
Gibson
,
at
the
"
Delphi
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Now
,
with
great
deference
both
to
the
first
-
named
gentleman
with
the
dirty
face
,
and
the
last
-
named
gentleman
in
the
non
-
existing
shirt
-
collar
,
we
do
NOT
mean
either
the
performer
who
so
grotesquely
burlesqued
the
Popish
conspirator
,
or
the
three
unchangeables
who
have
been
dancing
the
same
dance
under
different
imposing
titles
,
and
doing
the
same
thing
under
various
high
-
sounding
names
for
some
five
or
six
years
last
past
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
sooner
made
this
avowal
,
than
the
public
,
who
have
hitherto
been
silent
witnesses
of
the
dispute
,
inquire
what
on
earth
<EOS>
it
is
we
DO
mean
;
and
,
with
becoming
respect
,
we
proceed
to
tell
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
very
well
known
to
all
playgoers
and
pantomime
-
seers
,
that
the
scenes
in
which
a
theatrical
clown
is
at
the
very
height
of
his
glory
are
those
which
are
described
in
the
play
-
bills
as
"
Cheesemonger
's
shop
and
Crockery
warehouse
,
"
or
"
Tailor
's
shop
,
and
Mrs
Queertable
's
boarding
-
house
,
"
or
places
bearing
some
such
title
,
where
the
great
fun
of
the
thing
consists
in
the
hero
's
taking
lodgings
which
he
has
not
the
slightest
intention
of
paying
for
,
or
obtaining
goods
under
false
pretences
,
or
abstracting
the
stock
-
in
-
trade
of
the
respectable
shopkeeper
next
door
,
or
robbing
warehouse
porters
as
they
pass
under
his
window
,
or
,
to
shorten
the
catalogue
,
in
his
swindling
everybody
he
possibly
can
,
it
only
remaining
to
be
observed
that
,
the
more
extensive
the
swindling
is
,
and
the
more
barefaced
the
impudence
of
the
swindler
,
the
greater
<EOS>
the
rapture
and
ecstasy
of
the
audience
.
 
<EOS>
Now
it
is
a
most
remarkable
fact
that
precisely
this
sort
of
thing
occurs
in
real
life
day
after
day
,
and
nobody
sees
the
humour
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
illustrate
our
position
by
detailing
the
plot
of
this
portion
of
the
pantomime
---
not
of
the
theatre
,
but
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
The
Honourable
Captain
Fitz
-
Whisker
Fiercy
,
attended
by
his
livery
servant
Do'em
---
a
most
respectable
servant
to
look
at
,
who
has
grown
grey
in
the
service
of
the
captain
's
family
---
views
,
treats
for
,
and
ultimately
obtains
possession
of
,
the
unfurnished
house
,
such
a
number
,
such
a
street
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
tradesmen
in
the
neighbourhood
are
in
agonies
of
competition
for
the
captain
's
custom
;
the
captain
is
a
good
-
natured
,
kind
-
hearted
,
easy
man
,
and
,
to
avoid
being
the
cause
of
disappointment
to
any
,
he
most
handsomely
gives
orders
to
all
.
 
<EOS>
Hampers
of
wine
,
baskets
of
provisions
,
cart
-
loads
of
furniture
,
boxes
of
jewellery
,
supplies
of
luxuries
of
the
costliest
description
,
flock
to
the
house
of
the
Honourable
Captain
Fitz
-
Whisker
Fiercy
,
where
they
are
received
with
the
utmost
readiness
by
the
highly
respectable
Do'em
;
while
the
captain
himself
struts
and
swaggers
about
with
that
compound
air
of
conscious
superiority
and
general
blood
-
thirstiness
which
a
military
captain
should
always
,
and
does
most
times
,
wear
,
to
the
admiration
and
terror
of
plebeian
men
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
tradesmen
's
backs
are
no
sooner
turned
,
than
the
captain
,
with
all
the
eccentricity
of
a
mighty
mind
,
and
assisted
by
the
faithful
Do'em
,
whose
devoted
fidelity
is
not
the
least
touching
part
of
his
character
,
disposes
of
everything
to
great
advantage
;
for
,
although
the
articles
fetch
small
sums
,
still
they
are
sold
considerably
above
cost
price
,
the
cost
to
the
captain
having
been
nothing
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
After
various
manoeuvres
,
the
imposture
is
discovered
,
Fitz
-
Fiercy
and
Do'em
are
recognized
as
confederates
,
and
the
police
office
to
which
they
are
both
taken
is
thronged
with
their
dupes
.
  
<EOS>
Who
can
fail
to
recognize
in
this
,
the
exact
counterpart
of
the
best
portion
of
a
theatrical
pantomime
---
Fitz
-
Whisker
Fiercy
by
the
clown
;
Do'em
by
the
pantaloon
;
and
supernumeraries
by
the
tradesmen
?
 
<EOS>
The
best
of
the
joke
,
too
,
is
,
that
the
very
coal
-
merchant
who
is
loudest
in
his
complaints
against
the
person
who
defrauded
him
,
is
the
identical
man
who
sat
in
the
centre
of
the
very
front
row
of
the
pit
last
night
and
laughed
the
most
boisterously
at
this
very
same
thing
,
---
and
not
so
well
done
either
.
 
<EOS>
Talk
of
Grimaldi
,
we
say
again
!
 
<EOS>
Did
Grimaldi
,
in
his
best
days
,
ever
do
anything
in
this
way
equal
to
Da
Costa
?
  
<EOS>
The
mention
of
this
latter
justly
celebrated
clown
reminds
us
of
his
last
piece
of
humour
,
<EOS>
the
fraudulently
obtaining
certain
stamped
acceptances
from
a
young
gentleman
in
the
army
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
scarcely
laid
down
our
pen
to
contemplate
for
a
few
moments
this
admirable
actor
's
performance
of
that
exquisite
practical
joke
,
than
a
new
branch
of
our
subject
flashed
suddenly
upon
us
.
 
<EOS>
So
we
take
it
up
again
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
All
people
who
have
been
behind
the
scenes
,
and
most
people
who
have
been
before
them
,
know
,
that
in
the
representation
of
a
pantomime
,
a
good
many
men
are
sent
upon
the
stage
for
the
express
purpose
of
being
cheated
,
or
knocked
down
,
or
both
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
down
to
a
moment
ago
,
we
had
never
been
able
to
understand
for
what
possible
purpose
a
great
number
of
odd
,
lazy
,
large
-
headed
men
,
whom
one
is
in
the
habit
of
meeting
here
,
and
there
,
and
everywhere
,
could
ever
have
been
created
.
 
<EOS>
We
see
it
all
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
the
supernumeraries
in
the
pantomime
of
life
;
the
men
who
have
been
thrust
into
it
,
with
no
other
view
than
to
be
constantly
tumbling
over
each
other
,
and
running
their
heads
against
all
sorts
of
strange
things
.
 
<EOS>
We
sat
opposite
to
one
of
these
men
at
a
supper
-
table
,
only
last
week
.
 
<EOS>
Now
we
think
of
it
<EOS>
,
he
was
exactly
like
the
gentlemen
with
the
pasteboard
heads
and
faces
,
who
do
the
corresponding
business
in
the
theatrical
pantomimes
;
there
was
the
same
broad
stolid
simper
---
the
same
dull
leaden
eye
---
<EOS>
the
same
unmeaning
,
vacant
stare
;
and
whatever
was
said
,
or
whatever
was
done
,
he
always
came
in
at
precisely
the
wrong
place
,
or
jostled
against
something
that
he
had
not
the
slightest
business
with
.
 
<EOS>
We
looked
at
the
man
across
the
table
again
and
again
;
and
could
not
satisfy
ourselves
what
race
of
beings
to
class
him
with
.
 
<EOS>
How
very
odd
that
this
never
occurred
to
us
before
!
  
<EOS>
We
will
frankly
own
that
we
have
been
much
troubled
with
the
harlequin
.
 
<EOS>
We
see
harlequins
of
so
many
kinds
in
the
real
living
pantomime
,
that
we
hardly
know
which
to
select
as
the
proper
fellow
of
him
of
the
theatres
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
time
we
were
disposed
to
think
that
the
harlequin
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
young
man
of
family
and
independent
property
,
who
had
run
away
with
an
opera
-
dancer
,
and
was
fooling
his
life
and
his
means
away
in
light
and
trivial
amusements
.
 
<EOS>
On
reflection
,
however
,
we
remembered
that
harlequins
are
occasionally
guilty
of
witty
,
and
even
clever
acts
,
and
we
are
rather
disposed
to
acquit
our
young
men
of
family
and
independent
property
,
generally
speaking
,
of
any
such
misdemeanours
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
more
mature
consideration
of
the
subject
,
we
have
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
the
harlequins
of
life
are
just
ordinary
men
,
to
be
found
in
no
particular
walk
or
degree
,
on
whom
a
certain
station
,
or
particular
conjunction
of
circumstances
,
confers
the
magic
wand
.
<EOS>
And
this
brings
us
to
a
few
words
on
the
pantomime
of
public
and
political
life
,
which
we
shall
say
at
once
,
and
then
conclude
---
merely
premising
in
this
place
that
we
decline
any
reference
whatever
to
the
columbine
,
being
in
no
wise
satisfied
of
the
nature
of
her
connection
with
her
parti
-
coloured
lover
,
and
not
feeling
by
any
means
clear
that
we
should
be
justified
in
introducing
her
to
the
virtuous
and
respectable
ladies
who
peruse
our
lucubrations
.
  
<EOS>
We
take
it
that
the
commencement
of
a
Session
of
Parliament
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
drawing
up
of
the
curtain
for
a
grand
comic
pantomime
,
and
that
his
Majesty
's
most
gracious
speech
on
the
opening
thereof
may
be
not
inaptly
compared
to
the
clown
's
opening
speech
of
"
Here
we
are
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
lords
and
gentlemen
,
here
we
are
!
<EOS>
"
appears
,
to
our
mind
at
least
,
to
be
a
very
good
abstract
of
the
point
and
meaning
of
the
propitiatory
address
of
the
ministry
.
<EOS>
When
we
remember
how
frequently
this
speech
is
made
,
immediately
after
THE
CHANGE
too
,
the
parallel
is
quite
perfect
,
and
still
more
singular
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
cast
of
our
political
pantomime
never
was
richer
than
at
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
particularly
strong
in
clowns
.
 
<EOS>
At
no
former
time
,
we
should
say
,
have
we
had
such
astonishing
tumblers
,
or
performers
so
ready
to
go
through
the
whole
of
their
feats
for
the
amusement
of
an
admiring
throng
.
 
<EOS>
Their
extreme
readiness
to
exhibit
,
indeed
,
has
given
rise
to
some
ill
-
natured
reflections
;
it
having
been
objected
that
by
exhibiting
gratuitously
through
the
country
when
the
theatre
is
closed
,
they
reduce
themselves
to
the
level
of
mountebanks
,
and
thereby
tend
to
degrade
the
respectability
of
the
profession
.
 
<EOS>
Certainly
Grimaldi
never
did
this
sort
of
thing
;
and
though
Brown
,
King
,
and
Gibson
have
gone
to
the
Surrey
in
vacation
time
,
and
Mr
C
J
Smith
has
ruralised
at
Sadler
's
Wells
,
we
find
no
theatrical
precedent
for
a
general
tumbling
through
the
country
,
except
in
the
gentleman
,
name
unknown
,
who
threw
summersets
on
behalf
of
the
late
Mr
Richardson
,
and
who
is
no
authority
either
,
because
he
had
never
been
on
the
regular
boards
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
laying
aside
this
question
,
which
after
all
is
a
mere
matter
of
taste
,
we
may
reflect
with
pride
and
gratification
of
heart
on
the
proficiency
of
our
clowns
as
exhibited
in
the
season
.
 
<EOS>
Night
after
night
will
they
twist
and
tumble
about
,
till
two
,
three
,
and
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
;
playing
the
strangest
antics
,
and
giving
each
other
the
funniest
slaps
on
the
face
that
can
possibly
be
imagined
,
without
evincing
the
smallest
tokens
of
fatigue
.
 
<EOS>
The
strange
noises
,
the
confusion
,
the
shouting
and
roaring
,
amid
which
all
this
is
done
,
too
,
would
put
to
shame
the
most
turbulent
sixpenny
gallery
that
ever
yelled
through
a
boxing
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
especially
curious
to
behold
one
of
these
clowns
compelled
to
go
through
the
most
surprising
contortions
by
the
irresistible
influence
of
the
wand
of
office
,
which
his
leader
or
harlequin
holds
above
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
Acted
upon
by
this
wonderful
charm
he
will
become
perfectly
motionless
,
moving
neither
hand
,
foot
,
nor
finger
,
and
will
even
lose
the
faculty
of
speech
at
an
instant
's
notice
;
or
on
the
other
hand
,
he
will
become
all
life
and
animation
if
required
,
pouring
forth
a
torrent
of
words
without
sense
or
meaning
,
throwing
himself
into
the
wildest
and
most
fantastic
contortions
,
and
even
grovelling
on
the
earth
and
licking
up
the
dust
.
 
<EOS>
These
exhibitions
are
more
curious
than
pleasing
;
indeed
,
they
are
rather
disgusting
than
otherwise
,
except
to
the
admirers
of
such
things
,
with
whom
we
confess
we
have
no
fellow
-
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
Strange
tricks
---
very
strange
tricks
---
are
also
performed
by
the
harlequin
who
holds
for
the
time
being
the
magic
wand
which
we
have
just
mentioned
.
 
<EOS>
The
mere
waving
it
before
a
man
's
eyes
will
dispossess
his
brains
of
all
the
notions
previously
stored
there
,
and
fill
it
with
an
entirely
new
set
of
ideas
;
one
gentle
tap
on
the
back
will
alter
the
colour
of
a
man
's
coat
completely
;
and
there
are
some
expert
performers
,
who
,
having
this
wand
held
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
,
will
change
from
side
to
side
,
turning
their
coats
at
every
evolution
,
with
so
much
rapidity
and
dexterity
,
that
the
quickest
eye
can
scarcely
detect
their
motions
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
,
the
genius
who
confers
the
wand
,
wrests
it
from
the
hand
of
the
temporary
possessor
,
and
consigns
it
to
some
new
performer
;
on
which
occasions
all
the
characters
change
sides
,
and
then
the
race
and
the
hard
knocks
begin
anew
.
  
<EOS>
We
might
have
extended
this
chapter
to
a
much
greater
length
---
we
might
have
carried
the
comparison
into
the
liberal
professions
---
we
might
have
shown
,
as
was
in
fact
our
original
purpose
,
that
each
is
in
itself
a
little
pantomime
with
scenes
and
characters
of
its
own
,
complete
;
but
,
as
we
fear
we
have
been
quite
lengthy
enough
already
,
we
shall
leave
this
chapter
just
where
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
A
gentleman
,
not
altogether
unknown
as
a
dramatic
poet
,
wrote
thus
a
year
or
two
ago
---
  
<EOS>
"
All
the
world
's
a
stage
,
And
all
the
men
and
women
merely
players
:
"
  
and
<EOS>
we
,
tracking
out
his
footsteps
at
the
scarcely
-
worth
-
mentioning
little
distance
of
a
few
millions
of
leagues
behind
,
venture
to
add
,
by
way
of
new
reading
,
that
he
meant
a
Pantomime
,
and
that
we
are
all
actors
in
The
Pantomime
of
Life
.
    
<EOS>
Some
Particulars
Concerning
A
Lion
    
<EOS>
We
have
a
great
respect
for
lions
in
the
abstract
.
 
<EOS>
In
common
with
most
other
people
,
we
have
heard
and
read
of
many
instances
of
their
bravery
and
generosity
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
duly
admired
that
heroic
self
-
denial
and
charming
philanthropy
which
prompts
them
never
to
eat
people
except
when
they
are
hungry
,
and
we
have
been
deeply
impressed
with
a
becoming
sense
of
the
politeness
they
are
said
to
display
towards
unmarried
ladies
of
a
certain
state
.
 
<EOS>
All
natural
histories
teem
with
anecdotes
illustrative
of
their
excellent
qualities
;
and
one
old
spelling
-
book
in
particular
recounts
a
touching
instance
of
an
old
lion
,
of
high
moral
dignity
and
stern
principle
,
who
felt
it
his
imperative
duty
to
devour
a
young
man
who
had
contracted
a
habit
of
swearing
,
as
a
striking
example
to
the
rising
generation
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
is
extremely
pleasant
to
reflect
upon
,
and
,
indeed
,
says
a
very
great
deal
in
favour
of
lions
as
a
mass
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
bound
to
state
,
however
,
that
such
individual
lions
as
we
have
happened
to
fall
in
with
have
not
put
forth
any
very
striking
characteristics
,
and
have
not
acted
up
to
the
chivalrous
character
assigned
them
by
their
chroniclers
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
saw
a
lion
in
what
is
called
his
natural
state
,
certainly
;
that
is
to
say
,
we
have
never
met
a
lion
out
walking
in
a
forest
,
or
crouching
in
his
lair
under
a
tropical
sun
,
waiting
till
his
dinner
should
happen
to
come
by
,
hot
from
the
baker
's
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
have
seen
some
under
the
influence
of
captivity
,
and
the
pressure
of
misfortune
;
and
we
must
say
that
they
appeared
to
us
very
apathetic
,
heavy
-
headed
fellows
.
  
<EOS>
The
lion
at
the
Zoological
Gardens
,
for
instance
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
all
very
well
;
he
has
an
undeniable
mane
,
and
looks
very
fierce
;
but
,
Lord
bless
us
!
<EOS>
what
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
The
lions
of
the
fashionable
world
look
just
as
ferocious
,
and
are
the
most
harmless
creatures
breathing
.
<EOS>
A
box
-
lobby
lion
or
a
Regent
-
street
animal
will
put
on
a
most
terrible
aspect
,
and
roar
,
fearfully
,
if
you
affront
him
;
but
he
will
never
bite
,
and
,
if
you
offer
to
attack
him
manfully
,
will
fairly
turn
tail
and
sneak
off
.
 
<EOS>
Doubtless
these
creatures
roam
about
sometimes
in
herds
,
and
,
if
they
meet
any
especially
meek
-
looking
and
peaceably
-
disposed
fellow
,
will
endeavour
to
frighten
him
;
but
the
faintest
show
of
a
vigorous
resistance
is
sufficient
to
scare
them
even
then
.
 
<EOS>
These
are
pleasant
characteristics
,
whereas
we
make
it
matter
of
distinct
charge
against
the
Zoological
lion
and
his
brethren
at
the
fairs
,
that
they
are
sleepy
,
dreamy
,
sluggish
quadrupeds
.
  
<EOS>
We
do
not
remember
to
have
ever
seen
one
of
them
perfectly
awake
,
except
at
feeding
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
In
every
respect
we
uphold
the
biped
lions
against
their
four
-
footed
namesakes
,
and
we
boldly
challenge
controversy
upon
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
With
these
opinions
it
may
be
easily
imagined
that
our
curiosity
and
interest
were
very
much
excited
the
other
day
,
when
a
lady
of
our
acquaintance
called
on
us
and
resolutely
declined
to
accept
our
refusal
of
her
invitation
to
an
evening
party
;
"
for
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
have
got
a
lion
coming
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
at
once
retracted
our
plea
of
a
prior
engagement
,
and
became
as
anxious
to
go
,
as
we
had
previously
been
to
stay
away
.
  
<EOS>
We
went
early
,
and
posted
ourselves
in
an
eligible
part
of
the
drawing
-
room
,
from
whence
we
could
hope
to
obtain
a
full
view
of
the
interesting
animal
.
 
<EOS>
Two
or
three
hours
passed
,
the
quadrilles
began
,
<EOS>
the
room
filled
;
but
no
lion
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
of
the
house
became
inconsolable
,
---
for
it
is
one
of
the
peculiar
privileges
of
these
lions
to
make
solemn
appointments
and
never
keep
them
,
---
when
all
of
a
sudden
there
came
a
tremendous
double
rap
at
the
street
-
door
,
and
the
master
of
the
house
,
after
gliding
out
(
unobserved
as
he
flattered
himself
)
to
peep
over
the
banisters
,
came
into
the
room
,
rubbing
his
hands
together
with
great
glee
,
and
cried
out
in
a
very
important
voice
,
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
Mr
---
(
naming
the
lion
)
has
this
moment
arrived
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
all
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
door
,
and
we
observed
several
young
ladies
,
who
had
been
laughing
and
conversing
previously
with
great
gaiety
and
good
humour
,
grow
extremely
quiet
and
sentimental
;
while
some
young
gentlemen
,
who
had
been
cutting
great
figures
in
the
facetious
and
small
-
talk
way
,
suddenly
sank
very
obviously
in
the
estimation
of
the
company
,
and
were
looked
upon
with
great
coldness
and
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
young
man
who
had
been
ordered
from
the
music
shop
to
play
the
pianoforte
was
visibly
affected
,
and
struck
several
false
notes
in
the
excess
of
his
excitement
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
there
was
a
great
talking
outside
,
more
than
once
accompanied
by
a
loud
laugh
,
and
a
cry
of
"
Oh
!
capital
!
<EOS>
excellent
!
"
<EOS>
from
which
we
inferred
that
the
lion
was
jocose
,
and
that
these
exclamations
were
occasioned
by
the
transports
of
his
keeper
and
our
host
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
were
we
deceived
;
for
when
the
lion
at
last
appeared
,
we
overheard
his
keeper
,
who
was
a
little
prim
man
,
whisper
to
several
gentlemen
of
his
acquaintance
,
with
uplifted
hands
,
and
every
expression
of
half
-
suppressed
admiration
,
that
---
(
naming
the
lion
again
)
was
in
SUCH
cue
to
-
night
!
  
<EOS>
The
lion
was
a
literary
one
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
,
there
were
a
vast
number
of
people
present
who
had
admired
his
roarings
,
and
were
anxious
to
be
introduced
to
him
;
and
very
pleasant
it
was
to
see
them
brought
up
for
the
purpose
,
and
to
observe
the
patient
dignity
with
which
he
received
all
their
patting
and
caressing
.
 
<EOS>
This
brought
forcibly
to
our
mind
what
we
had
so
often
witnessed
at
country
fairs
,
where
the
other
lions
are
compelled
to
go
through
as
many
forms
of
courtesy
as
they
chance
to
be
acquainted
with
,
just
as
often
as
admiring
parties
happen
to
drop
in
upon
them
.
  
<EOS>
While
the
lion
was
exhibiting
in
this
way
,
his
keeper
was
not
idle
,
for
he
mingled
among
the
crowd
,
and
spread
his
praises
most
industriously
.
 
<EOS>
To
one
gentleman
he
whispered
some
very
choice
thing
that
the
noble
animal
had
said
in
the
very
act
of
coming
up
-
stairs
,
which
,
of
course
,
rendered
the
mental
effort
still
more
astonishing
;
to
another
he
murmured
a
hasty
account
of
a
grand
dinner
that
had
taken
place
the
day
before
,
where
twenty
-
seven
gentlemen
had
got
up
all
at
once
to
demand
an
extra
cheer
for
the
lion
;
and
to
the
ladies
he
made
sundry
promises
of
interceding
to
procure
the
majestic
brute
's
sign
-
manual
for
their
albums
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
there
were
little
private
consultations
in
different
corners
,
relative
to
the
personal
appearance
and
stature
of
the
lion
;
whether
he
was
shorter
than
they
had
expected
to
see
him
,
or
taller
,
or
thinner
,
or
fatter
,
or
younger
,
or
older
;
whether
he
was
like
his
portrait
,
or
unlike
it
;
and
whether
the
particular
shade
of
his
eyes
was
black
,
or
blue
,
or
hazel
,
or
green
,
or
yellow
,
or
mixture
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
these
consultations
the
keeper
assisted
;
and
,
in
short
,
the
lion
was
the
sole
and
single
subject
of
discussion
till
they
sat
him
down
to
whist
,
and
then
the
people
relapsed
into
their
old
topics
of
conversation
---
themselves
and
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
We
must
confess
that
we
looked
forward
with
no
slight
impatience
to
the
announcement
of
supper
;
for
if
you
wish
to
see
a
tame
lion
under
particularly
favourable
circumstances
,
feeding
-
time
is
the
period
of
all
others
to
pitch
upon
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
therefore
very
much
delighted
to
observe
a
sensation
among
the
guests
,
which
we
well
knew
how
to
interpret
,
and
immediately
afterwards
to
behold
the
lion
escorting
the
lady
of
the
house
down
-
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
We
offered
our
arm
to
an
elderly
female
of
our
acquaintance
,
who
---
dear
old
soul
!
---
is
the
very
best
person
that
ever
lived
,
to
lead
down
to
any
meal
;
for
,
be
the
room
ever
so
small
,
or
the
party
ever
so
large
,
she
is
sure
,
by
some
intuitive
perception
of
the
eligible
,
to
push
and
pull
herself
and
conductor
close
to
the
best
dishes
on
the
table
;
---
we
say
we
offered
our
arm
to
this
elderly
female
,
and
,
descending
the
stairs
shortly
after
the
lion
,
were
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
a
seat
nearly
opposite
him
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
the
keeper
was
there
already
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
planted
himself
at
precisely
that
distance
from
his
charge
which
afforded
him
a
decent
pretext
for
raising
his
voice
,
when
he
addressed
him
,
to
so
loud
a
key
,
as
could
not
fail
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
whole
company
,
and
immediately
began
to
apply
himself
seriously
to
the
task
of
bringing
the
lion
out
,
and
putting
him
through
the
whole
of
his
manoeuvres
.
 
<EOS>
Such
flashes
of
wit
as
he
elicited
from
the
lion
!
<EOS>
First
of
all
,
they
began
to
make
puns
upon
a
salt
-
cellar
,
and
then
upon
the
breast
of
a
fowl
,
and
then
upon
the
trifle
;
but
the
best
jokes
of
all
were
decidedly
on
the
lobster
salad
,
upon
which
latter
subject
the
lion
came
out
most
vigorously
,
and
,
in
the
opinion
of
the
most
competent
authorities
,
quite
outshone
himself
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
very
excellent
mode
of
shining
in
society
,
and
is
founded
,
we
humbly
conceive
,
upon
the
classic
model
of
the
dialogues
between
Mr
Punch
and
his
friend
the
proprietor
,
wherein
the
latter
takes
all
the
up
-
hill
work
,
and
is
content
to
pioneer
to
the
jokes
and
repartees
of
Mr
P
himself
,
who
never
fails
to
gain
great
credit
and
excite
much
laughter
thereby
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
it
be
founded
on
,
however
,
we
recommend
it
to
all
lions
,
present
and
to
come
;
for
in
this
instance
it
succeeded
to
admiration
,
and
perfectly
dazzled
the
whole
body
of
hearers
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
salt
-
cellar
,
and
the
fowl
's
breast
,
and
the
trifle
,
and
the
lobster
salad
were
all
exhausted
,
and
could
not
afford
standing
-
room
for
another
solitary
witticism
,
the
keeper
performed
that
very
dangerous
feat
which
is
still
done
with
some
of
the
caravan
lions
,
although
in
one
instance
it
terminated
fatally
,
of
putting
his
head
in
the
animal
's
mouth
,
and
placing
himself
entirely
at
its
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
Boswell
frequently
presents
a
melancholy
instance
of
the
lamentable
results
of
this
achievement
,
and
other
keepers
and
jackals
have
been
terribly
lacerated
for
their
daring
.
<EOS>
It
is
due
to
our
lion
to
state
,
that
he
condescended
to
be
trifled
with
,
in
the
most
gentle
manner
,
and
finally
went
home
with
the
showman
in
a
hack
cab
:
 
perfectly
peaceable
,
but
slightly
fuddled
.
  
<EOS>
Being
in
a
contemplative
mood
,
we
were
led
to
make
some
reflections
upon
the
character
and
conduct
of
this
genus
of
lions
as
we
walked
homewards
,
and
we
were
not
long
in
arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
our
former
impression
in
their
favour
was
very
much
strengthened
and
confirmed
by
what
we
had
recently
seen
.
 
<EOS>
While
the
other
lions
receive
company
and
compliments
in
a
sullen
,
moody
,
not
to
say
snarling
manner
,
these
appear
flattered
by
the
attentions
that
are
paid
them
;
while
those
conceal
themselves
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
from
the
vulgar
gaze
,
these
court
the
popular
eye
,
and
,
unlike
their
brethren
,
whom
nothing
short
of
compulsion
will
move
to
exertion
,
are
ever
ready
to
display
their
acquirements
to
the
wondering
throng
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
known
bears
of
undoubted
ability
who
,
when
the
expectations
of
a
large
audience
have
been
wound
up
to
the
utmost
pitch
,
have
peremptorily
refused
to
dance
;
well
-
taught
monkeys
,
who
have
unaccountably
objected
to
exhibit
on
the
slack
wire
;
and
elephants
of
unquestioned
genius
,
who
have
suddenly
declined
to
turn
the
barrel
-
organ
;
but
we
never
once
knew
or
heard
of
a
biped
lion
,
literary
or
otherwise
,
---
and
we
state
it
as
a
fact
which
is
highly
creditable
to
the
whole
species
,
---
who
,
occasion
offering
,
did
not
seize
with
avidity
on
any
opportunity
which
was
afforded
him
,
of
performing
to
his
heart
's
content
on
the
first
violin
.

Mr
Robert
Bolton
:
<EOS>
The
"
gentleman
Connected
With
The
Press
"
    
<EOS>
In
the
parlour
of
the
Green
Dragon
,
a
public
-
house
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
Westminster
Bridge
,
everybody
talks
politics
,
every
evening
,
the
great
political
authority
being
Mr
Robert
Bolton
,
an
individual
who
defines
himself
as
"
a
gentleman
connected
with
the
press
,
"
which
is
a
definition
of
peculiar
indefiniteness
.
<EOS>
Mr
Robert
Bolton
's
regular
circle
of
admirers
and
listeners
are
an
undertaker
,
a
greengrocer
,
a
hairdresser
,
a
baker
,
a
large
stomach
surmounted
by
a
man
's
head
,
and
placed
on
the
top
of
two
particularly
short
legs
,
and
a
thin
man
in
black
,
name
,
profession
,
and
pursuit
unknown
,
who
always
sits
in
the
same
position
,
always
displays
the
same
long
,
vacant
face
,
and
never
opens
his
lips
,
surrounded
as
he
is
by
most
enthusiastic
conversation
,
except
to
puff
forth
a
volume
of
tobacco
smoke
,
or
give
vent
to
a
very
snappy
,
loud
,
and
shrill
HEM
!
 
<EOS>
The
conversation
sometimes
turns
upon
literature
,
Mr
Bolton
being
a
literary
character
,
and
always
upon
such
news
of
the
day
as
is
exclusively
possessed
by
that
talented
individual
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
myself
(
of
course
,
accidentally
)
in
the
Green
Dragon
the
other
evening
,
and
,
being
somewhat
amused
by
the
following
conversation
,
preserved
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
lend
me
a
ten
-
pound
note
till
Christmas
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
hairdresser
of
the
stomach
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
's
your
security
,
Mr
Clip
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
stock
in
trade
,
---
there
's
enough
of
it
,
I
'm
thinking
,
Mr
Thicknesse
.
 
<EOS>
Some
fifty
wigs
,
two
poles
,
half
-
a
-
dozen
head
blocks
,
and
a
dead
Bruin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
wo
n't
,
then
,
"
growled
out
Thicknesse
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
lends
nothing
on
the
security
of
the
whigs
or
the
Poles
either
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
whigs
,
they
're
cheats
;
as
for
the
Poles
,
they
've
got
no
cash
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
have
nothing
to
do
with
blockheads
,
unless
I
ca
n't
awoid
it
(
ironically
)
,
and
a
dead
bear
's
about
as
much
use
to
me
as
I
could
be
to
a
dead
bear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
urged
the
other
,
"
there
's
a
book
as
belonged
to
Pope
,
Byron
's
Poems
,
valued
at
forty
pounds
,
because
it
's
got
Pope
's
identical
scratch
on
the
back
;
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
security
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
baker
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
how
d'ye
mean
,
Mr
Clip
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mean
!
<EOS>
why
,
that
it
's
got
the
HOTTERGRUFF
of
Pope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Steal
not
this
book
,
for
fear
of
hangman
's
rope
;
For
it
belongs
to
Alexander
Pope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
All
that
's
written
on
the
inside
of
the
binding
of
the
book
;
so
,
as
my
son
says
,
we
're
BOUND
to
believe
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
observed
the
undertaker
,
deferentially
,
and
in
a
half
-
whisper
,
leaning
over
the
table
,
and
knocking
over
the
hairdresser
's
grog
as
he
spoke
,
"
<EOS>
that
argument
's
very
easy
upset
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
sir
,
"
said
Clip
,
a
little
flurried
,
"
you
'll
pay
for
the
first
upset
afore
you
thinks
of
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
the
undertaker
,
bowing
amicably
to
the
hairdresser
,
"
I
THINK
,
I
says
I
THINK
---
you
'll
excuse
me
,
Mr
Clip
,
I
THINK
,
you
see
,
that
wo
n't
go
down
with
the
present
company
---
unfortunately
,
my
master
had
the
honour
of
making
the
coffin
of
that
ere
<EOS>
Lord
's
housemaid
,
not
no
more
nor
twenty
year
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
think
I
'm
proud
on
it
,
gentlemen
;
others
might
be
;
but
I
hate
rank
of
any
sort
.
<EOS>
I
've
no
more
respect
for
a
Lord
's
footman
than
I
have
for
any
respectable
tradesman
in
this
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
say
no
more
nor
I
have
for
Mr
Clip
!
<EOS>
(
bowing
)
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
that
ere
Lord
must
have
been
born
long
after
Pope
died
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
's
a
logical
interference
to
defer
,
that
they
neither
of
them
lived
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
So
what
I
mean
is
this
here
,
that
Pope
never
had
no
book
,
never
seed
,
felt
,
never
smelt
no
book
(
triumphantly
)
as
belonged
to
that
ere
Lord
.
<EOS>
And
,
gentlemen
,
when
I
consider
how
patiently
you
have
"
eared
the
ideas
what
I
have
expressed
,
I
feel
bound
,
as
the
best
way
to
reward
you
for
the
kindness
you
have
exhibited
,
to
sit
down
without
saying
anything
more
---
partickler
as
I
perceive
a
worthier
visitor
nor
myself
is
just
entered
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
in
the
habit
of
paying
compliments
,
gentlemen
;
when
I
do
,
therefore
,
I
hope
I
strikes
with
double
force
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Mr
Murgatroyd
!
<EOS>
what
's
all
this
about
striking
with
double
force
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
object
of
the
above
remark
,
as
he
entered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
excuse
a
man
's
getting
into
a
rage
during
winter
,
even
when
he
's
seated
so
close
to
the
fire
as
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
injudicious
to
put
yourself
into
such
a
perspiration
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
cause
of
this
extreme
physical
and
mental
excitement
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
Such
was
the
very
philosophical
address
of
Mr
Robert
Bolton
,
a
shorthand
-
writer
,
as
he
termed
himself
---
a
bit
of
equivoque
passing
current
among
his
fraternity
,
which
must
give
the
uninitiated
a
vast
idea
of
the
establishment
of
the
ministerial
organ
,
while
to
the
initiated
it
signifies
that
no
one
paper
can
lay
claim
to
the
enjoyment
of

Mr
Bolton
was
a
young
man
,
with
a
somewhat
sickly
and
very
dissipated
expression
of
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
His
habiliments
were
composed
of
an
exquisite
union
of
gentility
,
slovenliness
,
assumption
,
simplicity
,
NEWNESS
,
and
old
age
.
 
<EOS>
Half
of
him
was
dressed
for
the
winter
,
the
other
half
for
the
summer
.
<EOS>
His
hat
was
of
the
newest
cut
,
the
D'Orsay
;
his
trousers
had
been
white
,
but
the
inroads
of
mud
and
ink
,
etc
.
,
had
given
them
a
pie
-
bald
appearance
;
round
his
throat
he
wore
a
very
high
black
cravat
,
of
the
most
tyrannical
stiffness
;
while
his
TOUT
ENSEMBLE
was
hidden
beneath
the
enormous
folds
of
an
old
brown
poodle
-
collared
great
-
coat
,
which
was
closely
buttoned
up
to
the
aforesaid
cravat
.
<EOS>
His
fingers
peeped
through
the
ends
of
his
black
kid
gloves
,
and
two
of
the
toes
of
each
foot
took
a
similar
view
of
society
through
the
extremities
of
his
high
-
lows
.
 
<EOS>
Sacred
to
the
bare
walls
of
his
garret
be
the
mysteries
of
his
interior
dress
!
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
short
,
spare
man
,
of
a
somewhat
inferior
deportment
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
seemed
influenced
by
his
entry
into
the
room
,
and
his
salutation
of
each
member
partook
of
the
patronizing
.
 
<EOS>
The
hairdresser
made
way
for
him
between
himself
and
the
stomach
.
 
<EOS>
A
minute
afterwards
he
had
taken
possession
of
his
pint
and
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
A
pause
in
the
conversation
took
place
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
was
waiting
,
anxious
for
his
first
observation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Horrid
murder
in
Westminster
this
morning
,
"
observed
Mr
Bolton
.
  
<EOS>
Everybody
changed
their
positions
.
 
<EOS>
All
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
man
of
paragraphs
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
baker
murdered
his
son
by
boiling
him
in
a
copper

"
said
Mr
Bolton
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
heavens
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
everybody
,
in
simultaneous
horror
.
  
<EOS>
"
Boiled
him
,
gentlemen
!
"
<EOS>
added
Mr
Bolton
,
with
the
most
effective
emphasis
;
"
BOILED
him
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
particulars
,
Mr
B
,
"
inquired
the
hairdresser
,
"
the
particulars
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Bolton
took
a
very
long
draught
of
porter
,
and
some
two
or
three
dozen
whiffs
of
tobacco
,
doubtless
to
instil
into
the
commercial
capacities
of
the
company
the
superiority
of
a
gentlemen
connected
with
the
press
,
and
then
said
---
  
"
<EOS>
The
man
was
a
baker
,
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
Every
one
looked
at
the
baker
present
,
who
stared
at
Bolton
.
)
 
<EOS>
"
His
victim
,
being
his
son
,
also
was
necessarily
the
son
of
a
baker
.
 
<EOS>
The
wretched
murderer
had
a
wife
,
whom
he
was
frequently
in
the
habit
,
while
in
an
intoxicated
state
,
of
kicking
,
pummelling
,
flinging
mugs
at
,
knocking
down
,
and
half
-
killing
while
in
bed
,
by
inserting
in
her
mouth
a
considerable
portion
of
a
sheet
or
blanket
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
speaker
took
another
draught
,
everybody
looked
at
everybody
else
,
and
exclaimed
,
"
Horrid
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
appears
in
evidence
,
gentlemen
,
"
continued
Mr
Bolton
,
"
that
,
on
the
evening
of
yesterday
,
Sawyer
the
baker
came
home
in
a
reprehensible
state
of
beer

<EOS>
Mrs
S
,
connubially
considerate
,
carried
him
in
that
condition
up

stairs
into
his
chamber
,
and
consigned
him
to
their
mutual
couch
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
minute
or
two
she
lay
sleeping
beside
the
man
whom
the
morrow
's
dawn
beheld
a
murderer
!
"
<EOS>
(
Entire
silence
informed
the
reporter
that
his
picture
had
attained
the
awful
effect
he
desired
.
)
 
<EOS>
"
The
son
came
home
about
an
hour
afterwards
,
opened
the
door
,
and
went
up
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
(
gentlemen
,
conceive
his
feelings
of
alarm
)
,
scarcely
had
he
taken
off
his
indescribables
,
when
shrieks
(
to
his
experienced
ear
MATERNAL
shrieks
)
scared
the
silence
of
surrounding
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
his
indescribables
on
again
,
and
ran
down
-
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
He
opened
the
door
of
the
parental
bed
-
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
was
dancing
upon
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
What
must
have
been
his
feelings
!
 
<EOS>
In
the
agony
of
the
minute
he
rushed
at
his
male
parent
as
he
was
about
to
plunge
a
knife
into
the
side
of
his
female
.
 
<EOS>
The
mother
shrieked
.
 
<EOS>
The
father
caught
the
son
(
who
had
wrested
the
knife
from
the
paternal
grasp
)
up
in
his
arms
,
carried
him
down
-
stairs
,
shoved
him
into
a
copper
of
boiling
water
among
some
linen
,
closed
the
lid
,
and
jumped
upon
the
top
of
it
,
in
which
position
he
was
found
with
a
ferocious
countenance
by
the
mother
,
who
arrived
in
the
melancholy
wash
-
house
just
as
he
had
so
settled
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Where
's
my
boy
?

"
shrieked
the
mother
.

In
that
copper

boiling

coolly
replied
the
benign
father

<EOS>
"
Struck
by
the
awful
intelligence
,
the
mother
rushed
from
the
house
,
and
alarmed
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
The
police
entered
a
minute
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
The
father
,
having
bolted
the
wash
-
house
door
,
had
bolted
himself
.
 
<EOS>
They
dragged
the
lifeless
body
of
the
boiled
baker
from
the
cauldron
,
and
,
with
a
promptitude
commendable
in
men
of
their
station
,
they
immediately
carried
it
to
the
station
-
house
.
<EOS>
Subsequently
,
the
baker
was
apprehended
while
seated
on
the
top
of
a
lamp

post
in
Parliament
Street
,
lighting
his
pipe

The
whole
horrible
ideality
of
the
Mysteries
of
Udolpho
,
condensed
into
the
pithy
effect
of
a
ten
-
line
paragraph
,
could
not
possibly
have
so
affected
the
narrator
's
auditory
.
 
<EOS>
Silence
,
the
purest
and
most
noble
of
all
kinds
of
applause
,
bore
ample
testimony
to
the
barbarity
of
the
baker
,
as
well
as
to
Bolton
's
knack
of
narration
;
and
it
was
only
broken
after
some
minutes
had
elapsed
by
interjectional
expressions
of
the
intense
indignation
of
every
man
present
.
 
<EOS>
The
baker
wondered
how
a
British
baker
could
so
disgrace
himself
and
the
highly
honourable
calling
to
which
he
belonged
;
and
the
others
indulged
in
a
variety
of
wonderments
connected
with
the
subject
;
among
which
not
the
least
wonderment
was
that
which
was
awakened
by
the
genius
and
information
of
Mr
Robert
Bolton
,
who
,
after
a
glowing
eulogium
on
himself
,
and
his
unspeakable
influence
with
the
daily
press
,
was
proceeding
,
with
a
most
solemn
countenance
,

hear
the
pros

cons

Familiar
Epistle
From
A
Parent
To
A
Child
Aged
Two

<EOS>
And
Two
Months
    
MY
CHILD
,
  
<EOS>
To
recount
with
what
trouble
I
have
brought
you
up
---
with
what
an
anxious
eye
<EOS>
I
have
regarded
your
progress
,
---
how
late
and
how
often
I
have
sat
up
at
night
working
for
you
,
---
and
<EOS>
how
many
thousand
letters
I
have
received
from
,
and
written
to
your
various
relations
and
friends
,
many
of
whom
have
been
of
a
querulous
and
irritable
turn
,
---
to
dwell
on
the
anxiety
and
tenderness
with
which
I
have
(
as
far
as
I
possessed
the
power
)
inspected
and
chosen
your
food
;
rejecting
the
indigestible
and
heavy
matter
which
some
injudicious
but
well
-
meaning
old
ladies
would
have
had
you
swallow
,
and
retaining
only
those
light
and
pleasant
articles
which
I
deemed
calculated
to
keep
you
free
from
all
gross
humours
,
and
to
render
you
an
agreeable
child
,
and
one
who
might
be
popular
with
society
in
general
,
---
to
dilate
on
the
steadiness
with
which
I
have
prevented
your
annoying
any
company
by
talking
politics
---
always
assuring
you
that
you
would
thank
me
for
it
yourself
some
day
when
you
grew
older
,
---
to
expatiate
,
in
short
,
upon
my
own
assiduity
as
a
parent
,
is
beside
my
present
purpose
,
though
I
can
not
but
contemplate
your
fair
appearance
---
your
robust
health
,
and
unimpeded
circulation
(
which
I
take
to
be
the
great
secret
of
your
good
looks
)
without
the
liveliest
satisfaction
and
delight
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
trite
observation
,
and
one
which
,
young
as
you
are
,
I
have
no
doubt
you
have
often
heard
repeated
,
that
we
have
fallen
upon
strange
times
,
and
live
in
days
of
constant
shiftings
and
changes
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
melancholy
instance
of
this
only
a
week
or
two
since
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
returning
from
Manchester
to
London
by
the
Mail
Train
,
when
I
suddenly
fell
into
another
train
---
a
mixed
train
---
of
reflection
,
occasioned
by
the
dejected
and
disconsolate
demeanour
of
the
Post
-
Office
Guard
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
stopping
at
some
station
where
they
take
in
water
,
when
he
dismounted
slowly
from
the
little
box
in
which
he
sits
in
ghastly
mockery
of
his
old
condition
with
pistol
and
blunderbuss
beside
him
,
ready
to
shoot
the
first
highwayman
(
or
railwayman
)
who
shall
attempt
to
stop
the
horses
,
which
now
travel
(
when
they
travel
at
all
)
INSIDE
and
in
a
portable
stable
invented
for
the
purpose
,
---
he
dismounted
,
I
say
,
slowly
and
sadly
,
from
his
post
,
and
looking
mournfully
about
him
as
if
in
dismal
recollection
of
the
old
roadside
public
-
house
<EOS>
the
blazing
fire
---
the
glass
of
foaming
ale
---
the
buxom
handmaid
and
admiring
hangers
-
on
of
tap
-
room
and
stable
,
all
honoured
by
his
notice
;
and
,
retiring
a
little
apart
,
stood
leaning
against
a
signal
-
post
,
surveying
the
engine
with
a
look
of
combined
affliction
and
disgust
which
no
words
can
describe
.
 
<EOS>
His
scarlet
coat
and
golden
lace
were
tarnished
with
ignoble
smoke
;
flakes
of
soot
had
fallen
on
his
bright
green
shawl
---
his
pride
in
days
of
yore
---
the
steam
condensed
in
the
tunnel
from
which
we
had
just
emerged
,
shone
upon
his
hat
like
rain
.
 
<EOS>
His
eye
betokened
that
he
was
thinking
of
the
coachman
;
and
as
it
wandered
to
his
own
seat
and
his
own
fast
-
fading
garb
,
it
was
plain
to
see
that
he
felt
his
office
and
himself
had
alike
no
business
there
,
and
were
nothing
but
an
elaborate
practical
joke
.
  
<EOS>
As
we
whirled
away
,
I
was
led
insensibly
into
an
anticipation
of
those
days
to
come
,
when
mail
-
coach
guards
shall
no
longer
be
judges
of
horse
-
flesh
---
when
a
mail
-
coach
guard
shall
never
even
have
seen
a
horse
---
when
stations
shall
have
superseded
stables
,
and
corn
shall
have
given
place
to
coke

In
those
dawning

Some
Amburgh

break
wild

and
in
the
dress
of
a
mail

coach
guard
exhibit
his
TRAINED
ANIMALS
in
a
mock
mail

Then

shall
wondering
crowds
observe
how
that
,
with
the
exception
of
his
whip
,
it
is
all
his
eye
;
and
crowned
heads
shall
see
them
fed
on

unmoved

flee
affrighted

Such
,
my
child
,
were
the
reflections
from
which
I
was
only
awakened
then
,
as
I
am
now
,
by
the
necessity
of
attending
to
matters
of
present
though
minor
importance
.
 
<EOS>
I
offer
no
apology
to
you
for
the
digression
,
for
it
brings
me
very
naturally
to
the
subject
of
change
,
which
is
the
very
subject
of
which
I
desire
to
treat
.
  
<EOS>
In
fact
,
my
child
,
you
have
changed
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Henceforth
I
resign
you
to
the
guardianship
and
protection
of
one
of
my
most
intimate
and
valued
friends
,
Mr
Ainsworth
,
with
whom
,
and
with
you
,
my
best
wishes
and
warmest
feelings
will
ever
remain

<EOS>
I
reap
no
gain
or
profit
by
parting
from
you
,
nor
will
any
conveyance
of
your
property
be
required
,
for

<EOS>
in
this
respect
,
you
have
always
been
literally
"
Bentley

Miscellany

and
never
mine

<EOS>
Unlike
the
driver
of
the
old
Manchester
mail
,
I
regard
this
altered
state
of
things
with
feelings
of
unmingled
pleasure
and
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
Unlike
the
guard
of
the
new
Manchester
mail
,
YOUR
guard
is
at
home
in
his
new
place

has
roystering
highwaymen

gallant
desperadoes
ever
within
call

And
if
I
might
compare
you
,
my
child

to
an
engine

not

nor
a
Whig
engine

but
a
brisk

rapid
locomotive

your

he
who
now
stands
towards
you
IN
LOCO
PARENTIS

the
skilful
engineer

whole

I
would
humbly
crave
leave
to
postpone
the
departure
of
the
train
on
its
new

auspicious
course
for
one
brief
instant
,
while
,
with
hat
in

,
I
approach
side
by
side
with
the
friend
who
travelled
with
me
on
the
old
road

and
presume
to
solicit
favour
and
kindness
in
behalf
of
him
