The
first
ray
of
light
which
illumines
the
gloom
,
and
converts
into
a
dazzling
brilliancy
that
obscurity
in
which
the
earlier
history
of
the
public
career
of
the
immortal
Pickwick
would
appear
to
be
involved
,
is
derived
from
the
perusal
of
the
following
entry
in
the
Transactions
of
the
Pickwick
Club
,
which
the
editor
of
these
papers
feels
the
highest
pleasure
in
laying
before
his
readers
,
as
a
proof
of
the
careful
attention
,
indefatigable
assiduity
,
and
nice
discrimination
,
with
which
his
search
among
the
multifarious
documents
confided
to
him
has
been
conducted

That
while
this
Association
is
deeply
sensible
of
the
advantages
which
must
accrue
to
the
cause
of
science
,
from
the
production
to
which
they
have
just
adverted
---
no
less
than
from
the
unwearied
researches
of
Samuel
Pickwick
,
Esq
,
G*C*M*P*C
,
in
Hornsey
,
Highgate
,
Brixton
,
and
Camberwell
---
they
can
not
but
entertain
a
lively
sense
of
the
inestimable
benefits
which
must
inevitably
result
from
carrying
the
speculations
of
that
learned
man
into
a
wider
field
,
from
extending
his
travels
,
and
,
consequently
,
enlarging
his
sphere
of
observation

to
the
advancement
of
knowledge

diffusion
of
learning

That

with

just
mentioned

this

taken
into

<EOS>
A
casual
observer
,
adds
the
secretary
,
to
whose
notes
we
are
indebted
for
the
following
account
---
a
casual
observer
might
possibly
have
remarked
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
bald
head
,
and
circular
spectacles
,
which
were
intently
turned
towards
his
(
the
secretary
's
)
face
,
during
the
reading
of
the
above
resolutions
:
to
those
who
knew
that
the
gigantic
brain
of
Pickwick
was
working
beneath
that
forehead
,
and
that
the
beaming
eyes
of
Pickwick
were
twinkling
behind
those
glasses
,
the
sight
was
indeed
an
interesting
one
.
 
<EOS>
There
sat
the
man
who
had
traced
to
their
source
the
mighty
ponds
of
Hampstead
,
and
agitated
the
scientific
world
with
his
Theory
of
Tittlebats
,
as
calm
and
unmoved
as
the
deep
waters
of
the
one
on
a
frosty
day
,
or
as
a
solitary
specimen
of
the
other
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
an
earthen
jar
.
 
<EOS>
And
how
much
more
interesting
did
the
spectacle
become
,
when
,
starting
into
full
life
and
animation
,
as
a
simultaneous
call
for
"
Pickwick
"
burst
from
his
followers
,
that
illustrious
man
slowly
mounted
into
the
Windsor
chair
,
on
which
he
had
been
previously
seated
,
and
addressed
the
club
himself
had
founded
.
<EOS>
What
a
study
for
an
artist
did
that
exciting
scene
present
!
<EOS>
The
eloquent
Pickwick
,
with
one
hand
gracefully
concealed
behind
his
coat
tails
,
and
the
other
waving
in
air
to
assist
his
glowing
declamation
;
his
elevated
position
revealing
those
tights
and
gaiters
,
which
,
had
they
clothed
an
ordinary
man
,
might
have
passed
without
observation
,
but
which
,
when
Pickwick
clothed
them
---
if
we
may
use
the
expression
---
inspired
involuntary
awe
and
respect
;
surrounded
by
the
men
who
had
volunteered
to
share
the
perils
of
his
travels
,
and
who
were
destined
to
participate
in
the
glories
of
his
discoveries
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
right
sat
Mr
Tracy
Tupman
---
the
too
susceptible
Tupman
,
who
to
the
wisdom
and
experience
of
maturer
years
superadded
the
enthusiasm
and
ardour
of
a
boy
in
the
most
interesting
and
pardonable
of
human
weaknesses
---
love
.
 
<EOS>
Time
and
feeding
had
expanded
that
once
romantic
form
;
the
black
silk
waistcoat
had
become
more
and
more
developed
;
inch
by
inch
had
the
gold
watch
-
chain
beneath
it
disappeared
from
within
the
range
of
Tupman
's
vision
;
and
gradually
had
the
capacious
chin
encroached
upon
the
borders
of
the
white
cravat
:
but
the
soul
of
Tupman
had
known
no
change
 
---
admiration
of
the
fair
sex
was
still
its
ruling
passion
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
left
of
his
great
leader
sat
the
poetic
Snodgrass
,
and
near
him
again
the
sporting
Winkle
;
the
former
poetically
enveloped
in
a
mysterious
blue
cloak
with
a
canine
-
skin
collar
,
and
the
latter
communicating
additional
lustre
to
a
new
green
shooting
-
coat
,
plaid
neckerchief
,
and
closely
-
fitted
drabs
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
oration
upon
this
occasion
,
together
with
the
debate
thereon
,
is
entered
on
the
Transactions
of
the
Club
.
 
<EOS>
Both
bear
a
strong
affinity
to
the
discussions
of
other
celebrated
bodies
;
and
,
as
it
is
always
interesting
to
trace
a
resemblance
between
the
proceedings
of
great
men
,
we
transfer
the
entry
to

<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
observed
(
says
the
secretary
)
that
fame
was
dear
to
the
heart
of
every
man
.
 
<EOS>
Poetic
fame
was
dear
to
the
heart
of
his
friend
Snodgrass
;
the
fame
of
conquest
was
equally
dear
to
his
friend
Tupman
;
and
the
desire
of
earning
fame
in
the
sports
of
the
field
,
the
air
,
and
the
water
was
uppermost
in
the
breast
of
his
friend
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
He
(
Mr
Pickwick
)
would
not
deny
that
he
was
influenced
by
human
passions
and
human
feelings
(
cheers
)
---
possibly
by
human
weaknesses
(
loud
cries
of
"
No
"
)
;
but
this
he
would
say
,
that
if
ever
the
fire
of
self
-
importance
broke
out
in
his
bosom
,
the
desire
to
benefit
the
human
race
in
preference
effectually
quenched
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
praise
of
mankind
was
his
swing
;
philanthropy
was
his
insurance
office
.
 
<EOS>
(
Vehement
cheering
.
)
<EOS>
He
had
felt
some
pride
---
he
acknowledged
it
freely
,
and
let
his
enemies
make
the
most
of
it
<EOS>
---
he
had
felt
some
pride
when
he
presented
his
Tittlebatian
Theory
to
the
world
;
it
might
be
celebrated
or
it
might
not
.
 
<EOS>
(
A
cry
of
"
It
is
,
"
and
great
cheering
.
)
<EOS>
He
would
take
the
assertion
of
that
honourable
Pickwickian
whose
voice
he
had
just
heard
---
it
was
celebrated
;
but
if
the
fame
of
that
treatise
were
to
extend
to
the
farthest
confines
of
the
known
world
,
the
pride
with
which
he
should
reflect
on
the
authorship
of
that
production
would
be
as
nothing
compared
with
the
pride
with
which
he
looked
around
him
,
on
this
,
the
proudest
moment
of
his
existence
.
 
<EOS>
(
Cheers
.
)
<EOS>
He
was
a
humble
individual
.
 
<EOS>
(
"
No
,
no
.
"
)
Still
he
could
not
but
feel
that
they
had
selected
him
for
a
service
of
great
honour
,
and
of
some
danger
.
<EOS>
Travelling
was
in
a
troubled
state
,
and
the
minds
of
coachmen
were
unsettled
.
 
<EOS>
Let
them
look
abroad
and
contemplate
the
scenes
which
were
enacting
around
them
.
 
<EOS>
Stage

coaches
were
upsetting
in
all
directions
,
horses
were
bolting
,
boats
were
overturning
,
and
boilers
were
bursting

No

<EOS>
No

<EOS>
Let
that
honourable
Pickwickian
who
cried
"
No
"
so
loudly
come
forward
and
deny
it
,
if
he
could
.

<EOS>
Who
was
it
that
cried
"
No

<EOS>
(

<EOS>
Was
it
some
vain
and
disappointed
man
<EOS>
---
he
would
not
say
haberdasher
(
loud
cheers
)
 
---
who
,
jealous
of
the
praise
which
had
been
---
perhaps
undeservedly
---
bestowed
on
his
(
Mr
Pickwick
's
)
researches
,
and
smarting
under
the
censure
which
had
been
heaped
upon
his
own
feeble
attempts
at
rivalry

now
took
this
vile
and
calumnious
mode
of

Here

we

the

did

The
first
day
's
journey
,
and
the
first
evening
's
adventures
;
with
their
consequences
 
That
punctual
servant
of
all
work
,
the
sun
,
had
just
risen
,
and
begun
to
strike
a
light
on
the
morning
of
the
thirteenth
of
May
,
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
twenty
-
seven
,
when
Mr
Samuel
Pickwick
burst
like
another
sun
from
his
slumbers
,
threw
open
his
chamber
window
,
and
looked
out
upon
the
world
beneath
.
 
<EOS>
Goswell
Street
was
at
his
feet
,
Goswell
Street
was
on
his
right
hand
---
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
,
Goswell
Street
extended
on
his
left
;
and
the
opposite
side
of
Goswell
Street
was
over
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
Such
,
"
thought
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
are
the
narrow
views
of
those
philosophers
who
,
content
with
examining
the
things
that
lie
before
them
,
look
not
to
the
truths
which
are
hidden
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
As
well
might
I
be
content
to
gaze
on
Goswell
Street
for
ever
,
without
one
effort
to
penetrate
to
the
hidden
countries
which
on
every
side
surround
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
having
given
vent
to
this
beautiful
reflection
,
Mr
Pickwick
proceeded
to
put
himself
into
his
clothes
,
and
his
clothes
into
his
portmanteau
.
 
<EOS>
Great
men
are
seldom
over
scrupulous
in
the
arrangement
of
their
attire
;
the
operation
of
shaving
,
dressing
,
and
coffee

imbibing
was
soon
performed
;
and

in
another
hour

Mr
Pickwick

with
his
portmanteau
in
his
hand
,
his
telescope
in
his
greatcoat
pocket
,
and
his
note
-
book
in
his
waistcoat
,
ready
for
the
reception
of
any
discoveries
worthy
of
being
noted
down
,
had
arrived
at
the
coach
-
stand
in
St
Martin's
-
le

Grand

"
<EOS>
Cab
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
you
are
,
sir
,
"
shouted
a
strange
specimen
of
the
human
race
,
in
a
sackcloth
coat
,
and
apron
of
the
same
,
who
,
with
a
brass
label
and
number
round
his
neck
,
looked
as
if
he
were
catalogued
in
some
collection
of
rarities
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
waterman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
you
are
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
then
,
fust
cab
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
the
first
cab
having
been
fetched
from
the
public
-
house
,
where
he
had
been
smoking
his
first
pipe
,
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
portmanteau
were
thrown
into
the
vehicle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Golden
Cross
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Only
a
bob
's
vorth
,
Tommy
,
"
cried
the
driver
sulkily
,
for
the
information
of
his
friend
the
waterman
,
as
the
cab
drove
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
old
is
that
horse
,
my
friend
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
,
rubbing
his
nose
with
the
shilling
he
had
reserved
for
the
fare
.
   
<EOS>
"
Forty
-
two
,
"
replied
the
driver
,
eyeing
him
askant
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mr
Pickwick
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
note
-
book
.
 
<EOS>
The
driver
reiterated
his
former
statement
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
looked
very
hard
at
the
man
's
face
,
but
his
features
were
immovable
,
so
he
noted
down
the
fact
forthwith
.
"
<EOS>
And
how
long
do
you
keep
him
out
at
a
time
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
,
searching
for
further
information
.
   
<EOS>
"
Two
or
three
veeks
,
"
replied
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Weeks
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
in
astonishment
,
and
out
came
the
note
-
book
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
lives
at
Pentonwil
when
he
's
at
home
,
"
observed
the
driver
coolly
,
"
but
we
seldom
takes
him
home
,
on
account
of
his
weakness
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
account
of
his
weakness
!
"
reiterated
the
perplexed
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
always
falls
down
when
he
's
took
out
o
'
the
cab
,
"
continued
the
driver
,
"
but
when
he
's
in
it
,
we
bears
him
up
werry
tight
,
and
takes
him
in
werry
short
,
so
as
he
ca
n't
werry
well
fall
down
;
and
we
've
got
a
pair
o
<EOS>
'
precious
large
wheels
on

<EOS>
so
ven
<EOS>
he
does
move
,
they
run
after
him
,
and
he
must
go
on
<EOS>
---
he
ca
n't
help
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
entered
every
word
of
this
statement
in
his
notebook
,
with
the
view
of
communicating
it
to
the
club
,
as
a
singular
instance
of
the
tenacity
of
life
in
horses
under
trying
circumstances
.
<EOS>
The
entry
was
scarcely
completed
when
they
reached
the
Golden
Cross
.
 
<EOS>
Down
jumped
the
driver
,
and
out
got
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
,
Mr
Snodgrass
,
and
Mr
Winkle
,
who
had
been
anxiously
waiting
the
arrival
of
their
illustrious
leader
,
crowded
to
welcome
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
your
fare
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
holding
out
the
shilling
to
the
driver
.
   
<EOS>
What
was
the
learned
man
's
astonishment
,
when
that
unaccountable
person
flung
the
money
on
the
pavement
,
and
requested
in
figurative
terms
to
be
allowed
the
pleasure
of
fighting
him
(
Mr
Pickwick
)
for
the
amount
!
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
mad
,
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
Or
drunk
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Or
both
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
on
!
"
said
the
cab
-
driver
,
sparring
away
like
clockwork
.
<EOS>
"
Come
on
---
all
four
on
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
lark
!
"
<EOS>
shouted
half
a
dozen
hackney
coachmen
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
to
vork
,
Sam
!
---
<EOS>
and
they
crowded
with
great
glee
<EOS>
round
the
party
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
row
,
Sam
?
"
inquired
one
gentleman
in
black
calico
sleeves
.
   
<EOS>
"
Row
!
"
replied
the
cabman
,
"
what
did
he
want
my
number
for
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
want
your
number
,
"
said
the
astonished
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
take
it
for
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
cabman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
take
it
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
indignantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Would
anybody
believe
,
"
continued
the
cab
-
driver
,
appealing
to
the
crowd
,
"
would
anybody
believe
as
an
informer'ud
go
about
in
a
man
's
cab
,
not
only
takin
'
down
his
number
,
but
ev'ry
word
he
says
into
the
bargain
"
(
a
light
flashed
upon
Mr
Pickwick
<EOS>
---
it
was
the
note
-
book
)
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
he
though
?
"
inquired
another
cabman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
did
he
,
"
replied
the
first
;
"
and
then
arter
aggerawatin
'
me
to
assault
him
,
gets
three
witnesses
here
to
prove
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
give
it
him
,
if
I
've
six
months
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Come
on
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
cabman
dashed
his
hat
upon
the
ground
,
with
a
reckless
disregard
of
his
own
private
property
,
and
knocked
Mr
Pickwick
's
spectacles
off
,
and
followed
up
the
attack
with
a
blow
on
Mr
Pickwick
's
nose
,
and
another
on
Mr
Pickwick
's
chest
,
and
a
third
in
Mr
Snodgrass
's
eye
,
and
a
fourth
,
by
way
of
variety
,
in
Mr
Tupman
's
waistcoat
,
and
then
danced
into
the
road
,
and
then
back
again
to
the
pavement
,
and
finally
dashed
the
whole
temporary
supply
of
breath
out
of
Mr
Winkle
's
body
;
and
all
in
half
a
dozen
seconds
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
's
an
officer
?
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
Put
'em
under
the
pump
,
"
suggested
a
hot
-
pieman
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
smart
for
this
,
"
gasped
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Informers
!
"
shouted
the
crowd
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
on
,
"
cried
the
cabman
,
who
had
been
sparring
without
cessation
the
whole
time
.
   
<EOS>
The
mob
hitherto
had
been
passive
spectators
of
the
scene
,
but
as
the
intelligence
of
the
Pickwickians
being
informers
was
spread
among
them
,
they
began
to
canvass
with
considerable
vivacity
the
propriety
of
enforcing
the
heated
pastry
-
vendor
's
proposition
:
and
there
is
no
saying
what
acts
of
personal
aggression
they
might
have
committed
,
<EOS>
had
not
the
affray
been
unexpectedly
terminated
by
the
interposition
of
a
new
-
comer
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
fun
?
"
said
a
rather
tall
,
thin
,
young
man
,
in
a
green
coat
,
emerging
suddenly
from
the
coach
-
yard
.
   
<EOS>
"
informers
!
<EOS>
"
shouted
the
crowd
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
not
,
"
roared
Mr
Pickwick
,
in
a
tone
which
,
to
any
dispassionate
listener
,
carried
conviction
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ai
n't
you
,
though
---
ai
n't
you
?
"
said
the
young
man
,
appealing
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
making
his
way
through
the
crowd
by
the
infallible
process
of
elbowing
the
countenances
of
its
component
members
.
   
<EOS>
That
learned
man
in
a
few
hurried
words
explained
the
real
state
of
the
case
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
along
,
then
,
"
said
he
of
the
green
coat
,
lugging
Mr
Pickwick
after
him
by
main
force
,
and
talking
the
whole
way
.
<EOS>
Here
,
No
.
 
924

take
your

,
and
take
yourself
off
---

<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
---
<EOS>
all

I

<EOS>
Pull

UP
---
Put
that
in
his
pipe
---
like
the
flavour
---
damned
rascals
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
a
lengthened
string
of
similar
broken
sentences
,
delivered
with
extraordinary
volubility
,
the
stranger
led
the
way
to
the
traveller
's
waiting
-
room
,
whither
he
was
closely
followed
by
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
disciples
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
,
waiter
!
<EOS>
"
shouted
the
stranger
,
ringing
the
bell
with
tremendous
violence
,
"
glasses
round
---
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
hot
and
strong
,
and
sweet
,
and
plenty
,
---
eye
damaged
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
Waiter
!
<EOS>
raw
beef
-
steak
for
the
gentleman
's
eye
---
<EOS>
nothing
like
raw
beef
-
steak
for
a
bruise
,
sir
;
cold
lamp
-
post
very
good
,
but
lamp
-
post
inconvenient
---
<EOS>
damned
odd
standing
in
the
open
street
half
an
hour
,
with
your
eye
against
a
lamp
-
post
---
eh
,
---
very
good
---
ha
!
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
the
stranger
,
without
stopping
to
take
breath
,
swallowed
at
a
draught
full
half
a
pint
of
the
reeking
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
flung
himself
into
a
chair
with
as
much
ease
as
if
nothing
uncommon
had
occurred
.
   
<EOS>
While
his
three
companions
were
busily
engaged
in
proffering
their
thanks
to
their
new
acquaintance
,
Mr
Pickwick
had
leisure
to
examine
his
costume
and
appearance
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
about
the
middle
height
,
but
the
thinness
of
his
body
,
and
the
length
of
his
legs
,
gave
him
the
appearance
of
being
much
taller
.
 
<EOS>
The
green
coat
had
been
a
smart
dress
garment
in
the
days
of
swallow
-
tails
,
but
had
evidently
in
those
times
adorned
a
much
shorter
man
than
the
stranger
,
for
the
soiled
and
faded
sleeves
scarcely
reached
to
his
wrists
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
buttoned
closely
up
to
his
chin
,
at
the
imminent
hazard
of
splitting
the
back
;
and
an
old
stock
,
without
a
vestige
of
shirt
collar
,
ornamented
his
neck
.
<EOS>
His
scanty
black
trousers
displayed
here
and
there
those
shiny
patches
which
bespeak
long
service
,
and
were
strapped
very
tightly
over
a
pair
of
patched
and
mended
shoes
,
as
if
to
conceal
the
dirty
white
stockings
,
which
were
nevertheless
distinctly
visible
.
 
<EOS>
His
long
,
black
hair
escaped
in
negligent
waves
from
beneath
each
side
of
his
old
pinched
-
up
hat
;
and
glimpses
of
his
bare
wrists
might
be
observed
between
the
tops
of
his
gloves
and
the
cuffs
of
his
coat
sleeves
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
was
thin
and
haggard
;
but
an
indescribable
air
of
jaunty
impudence
and
perfect
self
-
possession
pervaded
the
whole
man
.
   
<EOS>
Such
was
the
individual
on
whom
Mr
Pickwick
gazed
through
his
spectacles
(
which
he
had
fortunately
recovered
)
,
and
to
whom
he
proceeded
,
when
his
friends
had
exhausted
themselves
,
to
return
in
chosen
terms
his
warmest
thanks
for
his
recent
assistance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
cutting
the
address
very
short
,
"
said
enough
---
no
more
;
smart
chap
that
cabman
---
handled
his
fives
well
;
but
if
I
'd
been
your
friend
in
the
green
jemmy
---
damn
me
---
punch
his
head
,
---
"
cod
<EOS>
I
would
,
---
pig
's
whisper
---
pieman
too
,
---
no
gammon
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
This
coherent
speech
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
the
Rochester
coachman
,
to
announce
that
"
the
Commodore
"
was
on
the
point
of
starting
.
   
<EOS>
"
Commodore
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
stranger
,
starting
up
,
"
my
coach
---

<EOS>

"
<EOS>
and
he
shook
his
head
most
knowingly
.
   
<EOS>
Now
it
so
happened
that
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
three
companions
had
resolved
to
make
Rochester
their
first
halting
-
place
too
;
and
having
intimated
to
their
new
-
found
acquaintance
that
they
were
journeying
to
the
same
city
,
they
agreed
to
occupy
the
seat
at
the
back
of
the
coach
,
where
they
could
all
sit
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
Up
with
you
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
assisting
Mr
Pickwick
on
to
the
roof
with
so
much
precipitation
as
to
impair
the
gravity
of
that
gentleman
's
deportment
very
materially
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Any
luggage
,
Sir
?
"
inquired
the
coachman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who

I

<EOS>
Brown

"
replied
the
stranger
,
as
he
forced
into
his
pocket
as
much
as
he
could
of
the
brown
paper
parcel
,
which
presented
most
suspicious
indications
of
containing
one
shirt
and
a
handkerchief
.
   
<EOS>
"
Heads
,
heads
---
take
care
of
your
heads

"
cried
the
loquacious
stranger
,
as
they
came
out
under
the
low
archway
,
which
in
those
days
formed
the
entrance
to
the
coach
-
yard
.

<EOS>
"
I

Mr

turned

words
;

whisper
passed
from
Mr
Pickwick
to
Mr
Snodgrass
,
from
Mr
Snodgrass
to

and
nods

assent

Mr

and
lifting
the
pinched

up
hat
a
few
inches
from
his
head
,
and
carelessly
replacing
it
very
much
on
one
side
,
the
stranger
,
with
half
the
brown
paper
parcel
sticking
out
of
his
pocket
,
walked
briskly
up
the
yard
,
and
turned
into
the
High
Street
.

"
<EOS>
Evidently
a
traveller
in

countries

<EOS>
"
I

like

Mr
Snodgrass

<EOS>
"

Mr

<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
said
nothing
;
but
he
thought
of
Donna
Christina
,
the
stomach
pump
,
and
the
fountain
;
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears

<EOS>
A
private
sitting
-
room
having
been
engaged
,
bedrooms
inspected
,
and
dinner
ordered
,
the
party
walked
out
to
view
the
city
and
adjoining
neighbourhood
.
   
<EOS>
We
do
not
find
,
from
a
careful
perusal
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
notes
of
the
four
towns
,
Stroud
,
Rochester
,
Chatham
,
and
Brompton
,
that
his
impressions
of
their
appearance
differ
in
any
material
point
from
those
of
other
travellers
who
have
gone
over
the
same
ground
.
 
<EOS>
His
general
description
is
easily
abridged
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
principal
productions
of
these
towns
,
"
says
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
appear
to
be
soldiers
,
sailors
,
Jews
,
chalk
,
shrimps
,
officers
,
and
dockyard
men
.
 
<EOS>
The
commodities
chiefly
exposed
for
sale
in
the
public
streets
are
marine
stores
,
hard
-
bake
,
apples
,
flat
-
fish
,
and
oysters
.
 
<EOS>
The
streets
present
a
lively
and
animated
appearance
,
occasioned
chiefly
by
the
conviviality
of
the
military
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
truly
delightful
to
a
philanthropic
mind
to
see
these
gallant
men
staggering
along
under
the
influence
of
an
overflow
both
of
animal
and
ardent
spirits
;
more
especially
when
we
remember
that
the
following
them
about
,
and
jesting
with
them
,
affords
a
cheap
and
innocent
amusement
for
the
boy
population
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
,
"
adds
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
can
exceed
their
good
-
humour
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
<EOS>
but
the
day
before
my
arrival
that
one
of
them
had
been
most
grossly
insulted
in
the
house
of
a
publican
.
 
<EOS>
The
barmaid
had
positively
refused
to
draw
him
any
more
liquor
;
in
return
for
which
he
had
(
merely
in
playfulness
)
drawn
his
bayonet
,
and
wounded
the
girl
in
the
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
this
fine
fellow
was
the
very
first
to
go
down
to
the
house
next
morning
and
express
his
readiness
to
overlook
the
matter
,
and
forget
what
had
occurred
!
   
<EOS>
"
The
consumption
of
tobacco
in
these
towns
,
"
continues
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
must
be
very
great
,
and
the
smell
which
pervades
the
streets
must
be
exceedingly
delicious
to
those
who
are
extremely
fond
of
smoking
.
 
<EOS>
A
superficial
traveller
might
object
to
the
dirt
,
which
is
their
leading
characteristic
;
but
to
those
who
view
it
as
an
indication
of
traffic
and
commercial
prosperity
,
it
is
truly
gratifying
.
"
   
<EOS>
Punctual
to
five
o'clock
came
the
stranger
,
and
shortly
afterwards
the
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
divested
himself
of
his
brown
paper
parcel
,
but
had
made
no
alteration
in
his
attire
,
and
was
,
if
possible
,
more
loquacious
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's

"
<EOS>
he
inquired

the
waiter
removed

filled

emptied

<EOS>
Mr

again
expressed
an
earnest

to
be
present
at
the
festivity
;
but
meeting
with
no
response
in
the
darkened
eye
of
Mr
Snodgrass

or
the
abstracted
gaze
of
Mr
Pickwick

he
applied
himself
with
great
interest
to
the
port

and
dessert
,
which
had
just
been
placed
on
the
table

withdrew

had
filled
about
two
minutes
before
,
and
poured
out
another
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
used
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
The
wine
was
passed
,
and
a
fresh
supply
ordered
.
 
<EOS>
The
visitor
talked
,
the
Pickwickians
listened
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
felt
every
moment
more
disposed
for
the
ball
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
countenance
glowed
with
an
expression
of
universal
philanthropy
,
and
Mr
Winkle
and
Mr
Snodgrass
fell
fast
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
're
beginning
upstairs
,
"
said
the
stranger
---
"
hear
the
company
---
fiddles
tuning
---
now
the
harp
---
there
they
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
various
sounds
which
found
their
way
downstairs
announced
the
commencement
of
the
first
quadrille
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
I
should
like
to
go
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
should
I
,
"
said
the
stranger
---
"
confounded
luggage
,
---
heavy
smacks
---
nothing
to
go
in
---
<EOS>
odd
,
ai
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
Now
general
benevolence
was
one
of
the
leading
features
of
the
Pickwickian
theory
,
and
no
one
was
more
remarkable
for
the
zealous
manner
in
which
he
observed
so
noble
a
principle
than
Mr
Tracy
Tupman
.
 
<EOS>
The
number
of
instances
recorded
on
the
Transactions
of
the
Society
,
in
which
that
excellent
man
referred
objects
of
charity
to
the
houses
of
other
members
for
left
-
off
garments
or
pecuniary
relief
is
almost
incredible
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
happy
to
lend
you
a
change
of
apparel
for
the
purpose
,
"
said
Mr
Tracy
Tupman
,
"
but
you
are
rather
slim
,
and
I
am

"
   
"
Rather

<EOS>
pass
the
wine
.
"
   
<EOS>
Whether
Mr
Tupman
was
somewhat
indignant
at
the
peremptory
tone
in
which
he
was
desired
to
pass
the
wine
which
the
stranger
passed
so
quickly
away
,
or
whether
he
felt
very
properly
scandalised
at
an
influential
member
of
the
Pickwick
Club
being
ignominiously
compared
to
a
dismounted
Bacchus
,
is
a
fact
not
yet
completely
ascertained
.
 
<EOS>
He
passed
the
wine
,
coughed
twice
,
and
looked
at
the
stranger
for
several
seconds
with
a
stern
intensity
;
as
that
individual
,
however
,
appeared
perfectly
collected
,
and
quite
calm
under
his
searching
glance
,
he
gradually
relaxed
,
and
reverted
to
the
subject
of
the
ball
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
about
to
observe
,
Sir
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
though
my
apparel
would
be
too
large
,
a
suit
of
my
friend
Mr
Winkle
's
would
,
perhaps
,
fit
you
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
stranger
took
Mr
Winkle
's
measure
with
his
eye
,
and
that
feature
glistened
with
satisfaction
as
he
said
,
"
Just
the
thing
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
looked
round
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
wine
,
which
had
exerted
its
somniferous
influence
over
Mr
Snodgrass
and
Mr
Winkle
,
had
stolen
upon
the
senses
of
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
That
gentleman
had
gradually
passed
through
the
various
stages
which
precede
the
lethargy
produced
by
dinner
,
and
its
consequences
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
undergone
the
ordinary
transitions
from
the
height
of
conviviality
to
the
depth
of
misery
,
and
from
the
depth
of
misery
to
the
height
of
conviviality
.
 
<EOS>
Like
a
gas
-
lamp
in
the
street
,
with
the
wind
in
the
pipe
,
he
had
exhibited
for
a
moment
an
unnatural
brilliancy
,
then
sank
so
low
as
to
be
scarcely
discernible
;
after
a
short
interval
,
he
had
burst
out
again
,
to
enlighten
for
a
moment
;
then
flickered
with
an
uncertain
,
staggering
sort
of
light
,
and
then
gone
out
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
His
head
was
sunk
upon
his
bosom
,
and
perpetual
snoring
,
with
a
partial
choke
occasionally
,
were
the
only
audible
indications
of
the
great
man
's
presence
.
   
<EOS>
The
temptation
to
be
present
at
the
ball
,
and
to
form
his
first
impressions
of
the
beauty
of
the
Kentish
ladies
,
was
strong
upon
Mr
Tupman
.
 
<EOS>
The
temptation
to
take
the
stranger
with
him
was
equally
great
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
wholly
unacquainted
with
the
place
and
its
inhabitants
,
and
the
stranger
seemed
to
possess
as
great
a
knowledge
of
both
as
if
he
had
lived
there
from
his
infancy
.
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
was
asleep
,
and
Mr
Tupman
had
had
sufficient
experience
in
such
matters
to
know
that
the
moment
he
awoke
he
would
,
in
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
,
roll
heavily
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
undecided
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fill
your
glass
,
and
pass
the
wine
,
"
said
the
indefatigable
visitor
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
did
as
he
was
requested
;
and
the
additional
stimulus
of
the
last
glass
settled
his
determination
.
   
<EOS>
"
Winkle
's
bedroom
is
inside
mine
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
;
"
I
could
n't
make
him
understand
what
I
wanted
,
if
I
woke
him
now
,
but
<EOS>
I
know
he
has
a
dress
-
suit
in
a
carpet
bag
;
and
supposing
you
wore
it
to
the
ball
,
and
took
it
off
when
we
returned
,
I
could
replace
it
without
troubling
him
at
all
about
the
matter
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Capital

"
said
the
stranger
,
"
famous

---

---

"
   
<EOS>
"
We
must
purchase

,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not

"
said
the
stranger
,
"

"
and
down
came
the
sovereign
with
the
dragon
(
called
by
courtesy
a
woman
)
uppermost
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
rang
the
bell
,
purchased
the
tickets
,
and
ordered
chamber
candlesticks
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
quarter
of
an
hour
the
stranger
was
completely
arrayed
in
a
full
suit
of
Mr
Nathaniel
Winkle
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
new
coat
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
as
the
stranger
surveyed
himself
with
great
complacency
in
a
cheval
glass
;
"
the
first
that
's
been
made
with
our
club
button
,
"
and
he
called
his
companions
"
attention
to
the
large
gilt
button
which
displayed
a
bust
of
Mr
Pickwick
in
the
centre
,
and
the
letters
"
P*C
"
 
on
either
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
P*C

"
said
<EOS>
the
stranger
---
"

and
"

"
---
<EOS>
What
does

"
 
<EOS>
stand
for
---
Peculiar
Coat
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
,
with
rising
indignation
and
great
importance
,
explained
the
mystic
device
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rather
short
in
the
waist
,
ai
n't
it
?
"
said
the
stranger
,
screwing
himself
round
to
catch
a
glimpse
in
the
glass
of
the
waist
buttons
,
which
were
half
-
way
up
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
Like

"
 
<EOS>
Running
on
in
this
way
,
Mr
Tupman
's
new
companion
adjusted
his
dress
,
or
rather
the
dress
of
Mr
Winkle
;
and
,
accompanied
by
Mr
Tupman
,
ascended
the
staircase
leading
to
the
ballroom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
names
,
sir
?
"
said
the
man
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tracy
Tupman
was
stepping
forward
to
announce
his
own
titles
,
when
the
stranger
prevented
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
names

all

"
and
then
he
whispered
Mr
Tupman
,
"

"
The
door
was
thrown
open
,
and
Mr
Tracy
Tupman
and
the
stranger
entered
the
ballroom
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
room
,
with
crimson
-
covered
benches
,
and
wax
candles
in
glass
chandeliers
.
 
<EOS>
The
musicians
were
securely
confined
in
an
elevated
den
,
and
quadrilles
were
being
systematically
got
through
by
two
or
three
sets
of
dancers
.
 
<EOS>
Two
card
-
tables
were
made
up
in
the
adjoining
card
-
room
,
and
two
pair
of
old
ladies
,
and
a
corresponding
number
of
stout
gentlemen
,
were
executing
whist
therein
.
   
<EOS>
The
finale
concluded
,
the
dancers
promenaded
the
room
,
and
Mr
Tupman
and
his
companion
stationed
themselves
in
a
corner
to
observe
the
company
.
   
<EOS>
"

Mr

shouted
the
man
at
the
door
in
a
stentorian
voice

<EOS>
A
great
sensation
was
created
throughout
the
room
by
the
entrance
of
a
tall
gentleman
in
a
blue
coat
and
bright
buttons
,
a
large
lady
in
blue
satin

and
two
young
ladies

"

ear

as
the
charitable

ushered
Sir
Thomas
Clubber

family
to
the
top

the
room

<EOS>
The
Honourable
Wilmot

other
distinguished
gentlemen
crowded
to
render
homage
to
the
Misses
Clubber

and
Sir
Thomas
Clubber
stood
bolt
upright
,
and
looked
majestically
over
his
black
kerchief
at
the
assembled
company
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr

"
What

<EOS>
inquired
Mr

<EOS>
"

Mr

bowed
deferentially
to
Sir

and
Sir
Thomas
Clubber
acknowledged
the
salute
with
conscious
condescension

<EOS>
Lady
Clubber
took
a
telescopic
view
of
Mrs
Smithie
and
family
through
her
eye

glass
and
Mrs
Smithie
stared
in
her
turn
at
Mrs

<EOS>
"
Colonel

"

said
the
stranger
,
in
reply
to
Mr
Tupman
's
inquiring
look

<EOS>
Miss
Bulder
was
warmly
welcomed
by
the
Misses
Clubber
;
the
greeting
between
Mrs
Colonel
Bulder
and
Lady
Clubber
was
of
the
most
affectionate
description
;
Colonel
Bulder
and
Sir
Thomas
Clubber
exchanged
snuff
-
boxes
,
and
looked
very
much
like
a
pair
of
Alexander
Selkirks
---
"
Monarchs

<EOS>
While
the
aristocracy
of
the
place

the
Bulders
,
and
Clubbers
,
and
Snipes

were
thus
preserving
their
dignity
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
,
the
other
classes
of
society
were
imitating
their
example
in
other
parts
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
less
aristocratic
officers
of
the
97th
devoted
themselves
to
the
families
of
the
less
important
functionaries
from
the
dockyard
.
 
<EOS>
The
solicitors

wives

the
wine

merchant

wife

headed
another
grade
(
the
brewer

wife
visited
the
Bulders

;
and
Mrs
Tomlinson
,
the
post

office
keeper

seemed
by
mutual
consent
to
have
been
chosen
the
leader
of
the
trade
party

<EOS>
One
of
the
most
popular
personages
,
in
his
own
circle
,
present
,
was
a
little
fat
man
,
with
a
ring
of
upright
black
hair
round
his
head
,
and
an
extensive
bald
plain
on
the
top
of
it
---
Doctor
Slammer
,
surgeon
to
the
97th
.
 
<EOS>
The
doctor
took
snuff
with
everybody
,
chatted
with
everybody
,
laughed
,
danced
,
made
jokes
,
played
whist
,
did
everything
,
and
was
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
To
these
pursuits
,
multifarious
as
they
were
,
the
little
doctor
added
a
more
important
one
than
any
<EOS>
---
he
was
indefatigable
in
paying
the
most
unremitting
and
devoted
attention
to
a
little
old
widow
,
whose
rich
dress
and
profusion
of
ornament
bespoke
her
a
most
desirable
addition
to
a
limited
income
.
   
<EOS>
Upon
the
doctor
,
and
the
widow
,
the
eyes
of
both
Mr
Tupman
and
his
companion
had
been
fixed
for
some
time
,
when
the
stranger
broke
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lots
of
money
---
old
girl
---
pompous
doctor
---
not
a
bad
idea
---
good
fun
,
"
were
the
intelligible
sentences
which
issued
from
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
looked
inquisitively
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
dance
with
the
widow
,
"
said
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
is
she
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do

"
 
<EOS>
And
the
stranger
forthwith
crossed
the
room
;
and
,
leaning
against
a
mantel
-
piece
,
commenced
gazing
with
an
air
of
respectful
and
melancholy
admiration
on
the
fat
countenance
of
the
little
old
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
looked
on
,
in
mute
astonishment
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
progressed
rapidly
;
the
little
doctor
danced
with
another
lady
;
the
widow
dropped
her
fan
;
the
stranger
picked
it
up
,
and
presented
it
---
a
smile
---
a
bow
---
a
curtsey
---
a
few
words
of
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
walked
boldly
up
to
,
and
returned
with
,
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
;
a
little
introductory
pantomime
;
and
the
stranger
and
Mrs
Budger
took
their
places
in
a
quadrille
.
   
<EOS>
The
surprise
of
Mr
Tupman
at
this
summary
proceeding
,
great
as
it
was
,
was
immeasurably
exceeded
by
the
astonishment
of
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
was
young
,
and
the
widow
was
flattered
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
's
attentions
were
unheeded
by
the
widow
;
and
the
doctor
's
indignation
was
wholly
lost
on
his
imperturbable
rival
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Slammer
was
paralysed
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
Doctor
Slammer
,
of
the
97th
,
to
be
extinguished
in
a
moment
,
by
a
man
whom
nobody
had
ever
seen
before
,
and
whom
nobody
knew
even
now
!
<EOS>
Doctor
Slammer

Doctor
Slammer
of
the
97th
rejected
!
<EOS>
Impossible
!
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
it
was
;
there
they
were
.
 
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
introducing
his
friend
!
<EOS>
Could
he
believe
his
eyes
!
<EOS>
He
looked
again
,
and
was
under
the
painful
necessity
of
admitting
the
veracity
of
his
optics
;
Mrs
Budger
was
dancing
with
Mr
Tracy
Tupman
;
there
was
no
mistaking
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
widow
before
him
,
bouncing
bodily
here
and
there
,
with
unwonted
vigour
;
and
Mr
Tracy
Tupman
hopping
about
,
with
a
face
expressive
of
the
most
intense
solemnity
,
dancing
(
as
a
good
many
people
do
)
as
if
a
quadrille
were
not
a
thing
to
be
laughed
at
,
but
a
severe
trial
to
the
feelings
,
which
it
requires
inflexible
resolution
to
encounter
.
   
<EOS>
Silently
and
patiently
did
the
doctor
bear
all
this
,
and
all
the
handings
of
negus
,
and
watching
for
glasses
,
and
darting
for
biscuits
,
and
coquetting
,
that
ensued
;
but
,
a
few
seconds
after
the
stranger
had
disappeared
to
lead
Mrs
Budger
to
her
carriage
,
he
darted
swiftly
from
the
room
with
every
particle
of
his
hitherto
-
bottled
-
up
indignation
effervescing
,
from
all
parts
of
his
countenance
,
in
a
perspiration
of
passion
.
   
<EOS>
The
stranger
was
returning
,
and
Mr
Tupman
was
beside
him
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
in
a
low
tone
,
and
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
doctor
thirsted
for
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
exulting
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
triumphed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
doctor
,
in
an
awful
voice
,
producing
a
card
,
and
retiring
into
an
angle
of
the
passage
,
"
my
name
is
Slammer
,
Doctor
Slammer
,
sir
---

Regiment
---
<EOS>
Chatham
Barracks
---
my
card
,
Sir
,
my
card
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
added
more
,
but
his
indignation
choked
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
replied
the
stranger
coolly
,
"
Slammer
---
much
obliged
---
polite
attention
---
not
ill
now
,
Slammer
---
<EOS>
but
when
I
am

knock
you
up
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
---
you
're
a
shuffler
,
sir
,
"
gasped
the
furious
doctor
,
"
a
poltroon
---
a
coward
---
a
liar
---
<EOS>
a

a

will
nothing
induce
you
to
give
me

"
<EOS>
"
Oh

I

"
said
the
stranger
,
half
aside
,
"
negus
too
strong

cruel
;
"
and
he
moved
on
a
step
or
two
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
stopping
in
this
house
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
indignant
little
man
;
"
you
are
intoxicated
now
,
Sir
;
you
shall
hear
from
me
in
the
morning
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
find
you
out
,
sir
;
I
shall
find
you
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rather
you
found
me
out
than
found
me
at
home
,
"
replied
the
unmoved
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
Doctor
Slammer
looked
unutterable
ferocity
,
as
he
fixed
his
hat
on
his
head
with
an
indignant
knock
;
and
the
stranger
and
Mr
Tupman
ascended
to
the
bedroom
of
the
latter
to
restore
the
borrowed
plumage
to
the
unconscious
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
That
gentleman
was
fast
asleep
;
the
restoration
was
soon
made
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
was
extremely
jocose
;
and
Mr
Tracy
Tupman
,
being
quite
bewildered
with
wine
,
negus
,
lights
,
and
ladies
,
thought
the
whole
affair
was
an
exquisite
joke
.
 
<EOS>
His
new
friend
departed
;
and
,
after
experiencing
some
slight
difficulty
in
finding
the
orifice
in
his
nightcap
,
originally
intended
for
the
reception
of
his
head
,
and
finally
overturning
his
candlestick
in
his
struggles
to
put
it
on
,
Mr
Tracy
Tupman
managed
to
get
into
bed
by
a
series
of
complicated
evolutions
,
and
shortly
afterwards
sank
into
repose
.
   
<EOS>
Seven
o'clock
had
hardly
ceased
striking
on
the
following
morning
,
when
Mr
Pickwick
's
comprehensive
mind
was
aroused
from
the
state
of
unconsciousness
,
in
which
slumber
had
plunged
it
,
by
a
loud
knocking
at
his
chamber
door
.
<EOS>
"
Who
's
there
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
starting
up
in
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Boots
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Please
,
sir
,
can
you
tell
me
which
gentleman
of
your
party
wears
a
bright
blue
dress
-
coat
,
with
a
gilt
button
with
"
P*C
"
on
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
been
given
out
to
brush
,
"
thought
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
and
the
man
has
forgotten
whom
it
belongs
to
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Winkle
,
"
he
called
out
,
"
next
room
but
two
,
on
the
right
hand
.
"
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
sir
,
"
said
the
Boots
,
and
away
he
went
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Tupman
,
as
a
loud
knocking
at
his
door
roused
hint
from
his
oblivious
repose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
I
speak
to
Mr
Winkle
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
replied
Boots
from
the
outside
.
   
<EOS>
"
Winkle
---
Winkle
!
"
shouted
Mr
Tupman
,
calling
into
the
inner
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hollo
!
"
replied
a
faint
voice
from
within
the
bed
-
clothes
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
wanted
---
some
one
at
the
door
;
"
and
,
having
exerted
himself
to
articulate
thus
much
<EOS>
,
Mr
Tracy
Tupman
turned
round
and
fell
fast
asleep
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wanted
!
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
hastily
jumping
out
of
bed
,
and
putting
on
a
few
articles
of
clothing
;
"
wanted
!
<EOS>
at
this
distance
from
town
---
who
on
earth
can
want
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Gentleman
in
the
coffee
-
room
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
Boots
,
as
Mr
Winkle
opened
the
door
and
confronted
him
;
"
gentleman
says
he
'll
not
detain
you
a
moment
,
Sir
,
but
he
can
take
no
denial
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
odd
!
"
said
Mr
Winkle
;
"
I
'll
be
down
directly
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
hurriedly
wrapped
himself
in
a
travelling
-
shawl
and
dressing
-
gown
,
and
proceeded
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
An
old
woman
and
a
couple
of
waiters
were
cleaning
the
coffee
-
room
,
and
an
officer
in
undress
uniform
was
looking
out
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
round
as
Mr
Winkle
entered
,
and
made
a
stiff
inclination
of
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
Having
ordered
the
attendants
to
retire
,
and
closed
the
door
very
carefully
,
he
said
,
"
Mr
Winkle
,
I
presume
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Winkle
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
be
surprised
,
sir
,
when
I
inform
you
that
I
have
called
here
this
morning
on
behalf
of
my
friend
,
Doctor
Slammer
,
of
the
97th
.
"
   
"
Doctor
Slammer
!
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Slammer
.
 
<EOS>
He
begged
me
to
express
his
opinion
that
your
conduct
of
last
evening
was
of
a
description
which
no
gentleman
could
endure
;
and
"
(
he
added
)
"
which
no
one
gentleman
would
pursue
towards
another
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
's
astonishment
was
too
real
,
and
too
evident
,
to
escape
the
observation
of
Doctor
Slammer
's
friend
;
he
therefore
proceeded
---
"
<EOS>
My
friend
,
Doctor
Slammer
,
requested
me
to
add
,
that
he
was
firmly
persuaded
you
were
intoxicated
during
a
portion
of
the
evening
,
and
possibly
unconscious
of
the
extent
of
the
insult
you
were
guilty
of
.
 
<EOS>
He
commissioned
me
to
say
,
that
should
this
be
pleaded
as
an
excuse
for
your
behaviour
,
he
will
consent
to
accept
a
written
apology
,
to
be
penned
by
you
,
from
my
dictation
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
written
apology
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Mr
Winkle
,
in
the
most
emphatic
tone
of
amazement
possible
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
you
know
the
alternative
,
"
replied
the
visitor
coolly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Were
you
intrusted
with
this
message
to
me
by
name
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Winkle
,
whose
intellects
were
hopelessly
confused
by
this
extraordinary
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
present
myself
,
"
replied
the
visitor
,
"
and
in
consequence
of
your
firm
refusal
to
give
your
card
to
Doctor
Slammer
,
I
was
desired
by
that
gentleman
to
identify
the
wearer
of
a
very
uncommon
coat
---
a
bright
blue
dress
-
coat
,
with
a
gilt
button
displaying
a
bust
,
and
the
letters
"
P*C.
"
"
   
Mr
Winkle
actually
staggered
with
astonishment
as
he
heard
his
own
costume
thus
minutely
described
.
 
<EOS>
Doctor
Slammer
's
friend
proceeded
:
---
"
From
the
inquiries
I
made
at
the
bar
,
just
now
,
I
was
convinced
that
the
owner
of
the
coat
in
question
arrived
here
,
with
three
gentlemen
,
yesterday
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
I
immediately
sent
up
to
the
gentleman
who
was
described
as
appearing
the
head
of
the
party
,
and
he
at
once
referred
me
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
If
the
principal
tower
of
Rochester
Castle
had
suddenly
walked
from
its
foundation
,
and
stationed
itself
opposite
the
coffee
-
room
window
,
Mr
Winkle
's
surprise
would
have
been
as
nothing
compared
with
the
profound
astonishment
with
which
he
had
heard
this
address
.
 
<EOS>
His
first
impression
was
that
his
coat
had
been
stolen
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
allow
me
to
detain
you
one
moment
?
"
said
he
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
replied
the
unwelcome
visitor
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
ran
hastily
upstairs
,
and
with
a
trembling
hand
opened
the
bag
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
coat
in
its
usual
place
,
but
exhibiting
,
on
a
close
inspection
,
evident
tokens
of
having
been
worn
on
the
preceding
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
so
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
letting
the
coat
fall
from
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
took
too
much
wine
after
dinner
,
and
have
a
very
vague
recollection
of
walking
about
the
streets
,
and
smoking
a
cigar
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
I
was
very
drunk
;
---
I
must
have
changed
my
coat
---
gone
somewhere
---
and
insulted
somebody
<EOS>
---
I
have
no
doubt
of
it
;
and
this
message
is
the
terrible
consequence
.
"
 
<EOS>
Saying
which
,
Mr
Winkle
retraced
his
steps
in
the
direction
of
the
coffee
-
room
,
with
the
gloomy
and
dreadful
resolve
of
accepting
the
challenge
of
the
warlike
Doctor
Slammer
,
and
abiding
by
the
worst
consequences
that
might
ensue
.
   
<EOS>
To
this
determination
Mr
Winkle
was
urged
by
a
variety
of
considerations
,
the
first
of
which
was
his
reputation
with
the
club
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
always
been
looked
up
to
as
a
high
authority
on
all
matters
of
amusement
and
dexterity
,
whether
offensive
,
defensive
,
or
inoffensive
;
and
if
,
on
this
very
first
occasion
of
being
put
to
the
test
,
he
shrunk
back
from
the
trial
,
beneath
his
leader
's
eye
,
his
name
and
standing
were
lost
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
remembered
to
have
heard
it
frequently
surmised
by
the
uninitiated
in
such
matters
that
by
an
understood
arrangement
between
the
seconds
,
the
pistols
were
seldom
loaded
with
ball
;
and
,
furthermore
,
he
reflected
that
if
he
applied
to
Mr
Snodgrass
to
act
as
his
second
,
and
depicted
the
danger
in
glowing
terms
,
that
gentleman
might
possibly
communicate
the
intelligence
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
would
certainly
lose
no
time
in
transmitting
it
to
the
local
authorities
,
and
thus
prevent
the
killing
or
maiming
of
his
follower
.
   
<EOS>
Such
were
his
thoughts
when
he
returned
to
the
coffee
-
room
,
and
intimated
his
intention
of
accepting
the
doctor
's
challenge
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
refer
me
to
a
friend
,
to
arrange
the
time
and
place
of
meeting
?
"
said
the
officer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
unnecessary
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
;
"
name
them
to
me
,
and
I
can
procure
the
attendance
of
a
friend
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
say
---
sunset
this
evening
?
"
inquired
the
officer
,
in
a
careless
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
,
thinking
in
his
heart
it
was
very
bad
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
Fort
Pitt
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
saw
it
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
take
the
trouble
to
turn
into
the
field
which
borders
the
trench
,
take
the
foot
-
path
to
the
left
when
you
arrive
at
an
angle
of
the
fortification
,
and
keep
straight
on
,
till
you
see
me
,
I
will
precede
you
to
a
secluded
place
,
where
the
affair
can
be
conducted
without
fear
of
interruption
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fear
of
interruption
!
"
thought
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
more
to
arrange
,
I
think
,
"
said
the
officer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
aware
of
anything
more
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
-
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
morning
;
"
and
the
officer
whistled
a
lively
air
as
he
strode
away
.
   
<EOS>
That
morning
's
breakfast
passed
heavily
off
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
was
not
in
a
condition
to
rise
,
after
the
unwonted
dissipation
of
the
previous
night
;
Mr
Snodgrass
appeared
to
labour
under
a
poetical
depression
of
spirits
;
and
even
Mr
Pickwick
evinced
an
unusual
attachment
to
silence
and
soda
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
eagerly
watched
his
opportunity
:
it
was
not
long
wanting
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
proposed
a
visit
to
the
castle
,
and
as
Mr
Winkle
was
the
only
other
member
of
the
party
disposed
to
walk
,
they
went
out
together
.
<EOS>
"
Snodgrass
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
when
they
had
turned
out
of
the
public
street
.
 
<EOS>
"
Snodgrass
,
my
dear
fellow
,
can
I
rely
upon
your
secrecy
?
<EOS>
"
As
he
said
this
,
he
most
devoutly
and
earnestly
hoped
he
could
not
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
,
"
replied
Mr
Snodgrass
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
swear
---
"
   
"
No
,
no
,
"
interrupted
Winkle
,
terrified
at
the
idea
of
his
companion
's
unconsciously
pledging
himself
not
to
give
information
;
"
do
n't
swear
,
do
n't
swear
;
it
's
quite
unnecessary
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
dropped
the
hand
which
he
had
,
in
the
spirit
of
poesy
,
raised
towards
the
clouds
as
he
made
the
above
appeal
,
and
assumed
an
attitude
of
attention
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
your
assistance
,
my
dear
fellow
,
in
an
affair
of
honour
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
it
,
"
replied
Mr
Snodgrass
,
clasping
his
friend
's
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
With
a
doctor
---
Doctor
Slammer
,
of
the
97th
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
wishing
to
make
the
matter
appear
as
solemn
as
possible
;
"
an
affair
with
an
officer
,
seconded
by
another
officer
,
at
sunset
this
evening
,
in
a
lonely
field
beyond
Fort
Pitt
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
attend
you
,
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
astonished
,
but
by
no
means
dismayed
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
extraordinary
how
cool
any
party
but
<EOS>
the
principal
can
be
in
such
cases
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
had
forgotten
this
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
judged
of
his
friend
's
feelings
by
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
consequences
may
be
dreadful
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
doctor
,
I
believe
,
is
a
very
good
shot
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Most
of
these
military
men
are
,
"
observed
Mr
Snodgrass
calmly
;
"
but
so
are
you
,
ai
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
replied
in
the
affirmative
;
and
perceiving
that
he
had
not
alarmed
his
companion
sufficiently
,
changed
his
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
Snodgrass
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
emotion
,
"
if
I
fall
,
you
will
find
in
a
packet
which
I
shall
place
in
your
hands
a
note
for
my
---
 
for
my
father
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
attack
was
a
failure
also
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
was
affected
,
but
he
undertook
the
delivery
of
the
note
as
readily
as
if
he
had
been
a
twopenny
postman
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
fall
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
"
or
if
the
doctor
falls
,
you
,
my
dear
friend
,
will
be
tried
as
an
accessory
before
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
involve
my
friend
in
transportation
---
possibly
for
life
!
"
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
winced
a
little
at
this
,
but
his
heroism
was
invincible
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
cause
of
friendship
,
"
he
fervently
exclaimed
,
"
I
would
brave
all
dangers
.
"
   
<EOS>
How
Mr
Winkle
cursed
his
companion
's
devoted
friendship
internally
,
as
they
walked
silently
along
,
side
by
side
,
for
some
minutes
,
each
immersed
in
his
own
meditations
!
<EOS>
The
morning
was
wearing
away
;
he
grew
desperate
.
   
<EOS>
"
Snodgrass
,
"
he
said
,
stopping
suddenly
,
"
do
not
let
me
be
balked
in
this
matter
---
do
not
give
information
to
the
local
authorities
---
do
not
obtain
the
assistance
of
several
peace
officers
,
to
take
either
me
or
Doctor
Slammer
,
of
the
97th
Regiment
,
at
present
quartered
in
Chatham
Barracks
,
into
custody
,
and
thus
prevent
this
duel
!
<EOS>
---
I
say
,
do
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
seized
his
friend
's
hand
warmly
,
as
he
enthusiastically
replied
,
"
Not
for
worlds
!
"
   
<EOS>
A
thrill
passed
over
Mr
Winkle
's
frame
as
the
conviction
that
he
had
nothing
to
hope
from
his
friend
's
fears
,
and
that
he
was
destined
to
become
an
animated
target
,
rushed
forcibly
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
state
of
the
case
having
been
formally
explained
to
Mr
Snodgrass
,
and
a
case
of
satisfactory
pistols
,
with
the
satisfactory
accompaniments
of
powder
,
ball
,
and
caps
,
having
been
hired
from
a
manufacturer
in
Rochester
,
the
two
friends
returned
to
their
inn
;
Mr
Winkle
to
ruminate
on
the
approaching
struggle
,
and
Mr
Snodgrass
to
arrange
the
weapons
of
war
,
and
put
them
into
proper
order
for
immediate
use
.
   
<EOS>
it
was
a
dull
and
heavy
evening
when
they
again
sallied
forth
on
their
awkward
errand
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
was
muffled
up
in
a
huge
cloak
to
escape
observation
,
and
Mr
Snodgrass
bore
under
his
the
instruments
of
destruction
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
got
everything
?
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
in
an
agitated
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Everything
,
"
replied
Mr
Snodgrass
;
"
plenty
of
ammunition
,
in
case
the
shots
do
n't
take
effect
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
powder
in
the
case
,
and
I
have
got
two
newspapers
in
my
pocket
for
the
loadings
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
These
were
instances
of
friendship
for
which
any
man
might
reasonably
feel
most
grateful
.
 
<EOS>
The
presumption
is
,
that
the
gratitude
of
Mr
Winkle
was
too
powerful
for
utterance
,
as
he
said
nothing
,
but
continued
to
walk
on
---
rather
slowly
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
in
excellent
time
,
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
,
as
they
climbed
the
fence
of
the
first
field
;
"
the
sun
is
just
going
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
looked
up
at
the
declining
orb
and
painfully
thought
of
the
probability
of
his
"
going
down
"
himself
,
before
long
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
officer
,
"
exclaimed
Mr
Winkle
,
after
a
few
minutes
walking
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
?
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
---
the
gentleman
in
the
blue
cloak
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
looked
in
the
direction
indicated
by
the
forefinger
of
his
friend
,
and
observed
a
figure
,
muffled
up
,
as
he
had
described
.
 
<EOS>
The
officer
evinced
his
consciousness
of
their
presence
by
slightly
beckoning
with
his
hand
;
and
the
two
friends
followed
him
at
a
little
distance
,
as
he
walked
away
.
   
<EOS>
The
evening
grew
more
dull
every
moment
,
and
a
melancholy
wind
sounded
through
the
deserted
fields
,
like
a
distant
giant
whistling
for
his
house
-
dog
.
 
<EOS>
The
sadness
of
the
scene
imparted
a
sombre
tinge
to
the
feelings
of
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
He
started
as
they
passed
the
angle
of
the
trench
<EOS>
---
it
looked
like
a
colossal
grave
.
   
<EOS>
The
officer
turned
suddenly
from
the
path
,
and
after
climbing
a
paling
,
and
scaling
a
hedge
,
entered
a
secluded
field
.
 
<EOS>
Two
gentlemen
were
waiting
in
it
;
one
was
a
little
,
fat
man
,
with
black
hair
;
and
the
other
---
a
portly
personage
in
a
braided
surtout
---
was
sitting
with
perfect
equanimity
on
a
camp
-
stool
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
other
party
,
and
a
surgeon
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
;
"
take
a
drop
of
brandy
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
seized
the
wicker
bottle
which
his
friend
proffered
,
and
took
a
lengthened
pull
at
the
exhilarating
liquid
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
friend
,
Sir
,
Mr
Snodgrass
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
as
the
officer
approached
.
 
<EOS>
Doctor
Slammer
's
friend
bowed
,
and
produced
a
case
similar
to
that
which
Mr
Snodgrass
carried
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
nothing
further
to
say
,
Sir
,
I
think
,
"
he
coldly
remarked
,
as
he
opened
the
case
;
"
an
apology
has
been
resolutely
declined
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
,
who
began
to
feel
rather
uncomfortable
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
step
forward
?
"
said
the
officer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
replied
Mr
Snodgrass
.
 
<EOS>
The
ground
was
measured
,
and
preliminaries
arranged
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
these
better
than
your
own
,
"
said
the
opposite
second
,
producing
his
pistols
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
saw
me
load
them
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
object
to
use
them
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
Mr
Snodgrass
.
 
<EOS>
The
offer
relieved
him
from
considerable
embarrassment
,
for
his
previous
notions
of
loading
a
pistol
were
rather
vague
and
undefined
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
may
place
our
men
,
then
,
I
think
,
"
observed
the
officer
,
with
as
much
indifference
as
if
the
principals
were
chess
-
men
,
and
the
seconds
players
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
may
,
"
replied
Mr
Snodgrass
;
who
would
have
assented
to
any
proposition
,
because
he
knew
nothing
about
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
The
officer
crossed
to
Doctor
Slammer
,
and
Mr
Snodgrass
went
up
to
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
ready
,
"
said
he
,
offering
the
pistol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
your
cloak
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
got
the
packet
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
said
poor
Winkle
.
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
steady
,
and
wing
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
occurred
to
Mr
Winkle
that
this
advice
was
very
like
that
which
bystanders
invariably
give
to
the
smallest
boy
in
a
street
fight
,
namely
,
"
Go
in
,
and
win
"
---
an
admirable
thing
to
recommend
,
if
you
only
know
how
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
off
his
cloak
,
however
,
in
silence
<EOS>
---
it
always
took
a
long
time
to
undo
that
cloak
 
---
and
accepted
the
pistol
.
 
<EOS>
The
seconds
retired
,
the
gentleman
on
the
camp
-
stool
did
the
same
,
and
the
belligerents
approached
each
other
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
was
always
remarkable
for
extreme
humanity
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
conjectured
that
his
unwillingness
to
hurt
a
fellow
-
creature
intentionally
was
the
cause
of
his
shutting
his
eyes
when
he
arrived
at
the
fatal
spot
;
and
that
the
circumstance
of
his
eyes
being
closed
,
prevented
his
observing
the
very
extraordinary
and
unaccountable
demeanour
of
Doctor
Slammer
.
 
<EOS>
That
gentleman
started
,
stared
,
retreated
,
rubbed
his
eyes
,
stared
again
,
and
,
finally
,
shouted
,
"
Stop
,
stop
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
all
this
?
"
said
Doctor
Slammer
,
as
his
friend
and
Mr
Snodgrass
came
running
up
;
"
that
's
not
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Not
the
man
!
<EOS>
"
said
Doctor
Slammer
's
second
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
the
man
!
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
the
man
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
gentleman
with
the
camp
-
stool
in
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
the
little
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
the
person
who
insulted
me
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
extraordinary
!
"
exclaimed
the
officer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
,
"
said
the
gentleman
with
the
camp
-
stool
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
only
question
is
,
whether
the
gentleman
,
being
on
the
ground
,
must
not
be
considered
,
as
a
matter
of
form
,
to
be
the
individual
who
insulted
our
friend
,
Doctor
Slammer
,
yesterday
evening
,
whether
he
is
really
that
individual
or
not
;
"
and
having
delivered
this
suggestion
,
with
a
very
sage
and
mysterious
air
,
the
man
with
the
camp
-
stool
took
a
large
pinch
of
snuff
,
and
looked
profoundly
round
,
with
the
air
of
an
authority
in
such
matters
.
   
<EOS>
Now
Mr
Winkle
had
opened
his
eyes
,
and
his
ears
too
,
when
he
heard
his
adversary
call
out
for
a
cessation
of
hostilities
;
and
perceiving
by
what
he
had
afterwards
said
that
there
was
,
beyond
all
question
,
some
mistake
in
the
matter
,
he
at
once
foresaw
the
increase
of
reputation
he
should
inevitably
acquire
by
concealing
the
real
motive
of
his
coming
out
;
he
therefore
stepped
boldly
forward
,
and
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
the
person
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
that
,
"
said
the
man
with
the
camp
-
stool
,
"
is
an
affront
to
Doctor
Slammer
,
and
a
sufficient
reason
for
proceeding
immediately
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
be
quiet
,
Payne
,
"
said
the
doctor
's
second
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
not
communicate
this
fact
to
me
this
morning
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
---
to
be
sure
,
"
said
the
man
with
the
camp
-
stool
indignantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
entreat
you
to
be
quiet
,
Payne
,
"
said
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
repeat
my
question
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
,
who
had
had
time
to
deliberate
upon
his
answer
,
"
because
,
Sir
,
you
described
an
intoxicated
and
ungentlemanly
person
as
wearing
a
coat
which
I
have
the
honour
,
not
only
to
wear
but
to
have
invented
---
the
proposed
uniform
,
Sir
,
of
the
Pickwick
Club
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
The
honour
of
that
uniform
I
feel
bound
to
maintain
,
and
I
therefore
,
without
inquiry
,
accepted
the
challenge
which
you
offered
me

My
dear
Sir
,
"
said
the
good
-
humoured
little
doctor
advancing
with
extended
hand
,
"
I
honour
your
gallantry
.
 
<EOS>
Permit
me
to
say
,
Sir
,
<EOS>
that
I
highly
admire
your
conduct
,
and
extremely
regret
having
caused
you
the
inconvenience
of
this
meeting
,
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
you
wo
n't
mention
it
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
feel
proud
of
your
acquaintance
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
little
doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
afford
me
the
greatest
pleasure
to
know
you
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
Thereupon
the
doctor
and
Mr
Winkle
shook
hands
,
and
then
Mr
Winkle
and
Lieutenant
Tappleton
(
the
doctor
's
second
)
,
and
then
Mr
Winkle
and
the
man
with
the
camp
-
stool
,
and
,
finally
,
Mr
Winkle
and
Mr
Snodgrass
---
the
last
-
named
gentleman
in
an
excess
of
admiration
at
the
noble
conduct
of
his
heroic
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
may
adjourn
,
"
said
Lieutenant
Tappleton
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
added
the
doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Unless
,
"
interposed
the
man
with
the
camp
-
stool
,
"
unless
Mr
Winkle
feels
himself
aggrieved
by
the
challenge
;
in
which
case
,
I
submit
,
he
has
a
right
to
satisfaction
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
,
with
great
self
-
denial
,
expressed
himself
quite
satisfied
already
.
"
<EOS>
Or
possibly
,
"
said
the
man
with
the
camp
-
stool
,
"
the
gentleman
's
second
may
feel
himself
affronted
with
some
observations
which
fell
from
me
at
an
early
period
of
this
meeting
;
if
so
,
I
shall
be
happy
to
give
him
satisfaction
immediately
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
hastily
professed
himself
very
much
obliged
with
the
handsome
offer
of
the
gentleman
who
had
spoken
last
,
which
he
was
only
induced
to
decline
by
his
entire
contentment
with
the
whole
proceedings
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
seconds
adjusted
the
cases
,
and
the
whole
party
left
the
ground
in
a
much
more
lively
manner
than
they
had
proceeded
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remain
long
here
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Doctor
Slammer
of
Mr
Winkle
,
as
they
walked
on
most
amicably
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
shall
leave
here
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
,
"
was
the
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
trust
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
and
your
friend
at
my
rooms
,
and
of
spending
a
pleasant
evening
with
you
,
after
this
awkward
mistake
,
"
said
the
little
doctor
;
"
are
you
disengaged
this
evening
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
some
friends
here
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
,
"
and
I
should
not
like
to
leave
them
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
and
your
friend
will
join
us
at
the
Bull
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
great
pleasure
,
"
said
the
little
doctor
;
"
will
ten
o'clock
be
too
late
to
look
in
for
half
an
hour
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
most
happy
to
introduce
you
to
my
friends
,
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Tupman
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
give
me
great
pleasure
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
"
replied
Doctor
Slammer
,
little
suspecting
who
Mr
Tupman
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
sure
to
come
?
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
certainly
.
"
   
<EOS>
By
this
time
they
had
reached
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
Cordial
farewells
were
exchanged
,
and
the
party
separated
.
 
<EOS>
Doctor
Slammer
and
his
friends
repaired
to
the
barracks
,
and
Mr
Winkle
,
accompanied
by
Mr
Snodgrass
,
returned
to
their
inn

Chapter
3
.
<EOS>
A
new
acquaintance
---
the
stroller
's
tale
---
a
disagreeable
interruption
,
and
an
unpleasant
encounter
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
had
felt
some
apprehensions
in
consequence
of
the
unusual
absence
of
his
two
friends
,
which
their
mysterious
behaviour
during
the
whole
morning
had
by
no
means
tended
to
diminish
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
,
therefore
,
with
more
than
ordinary
pleasure
that
he
rose
to
greet
them
when
they
again
entered
;
and
with
more
than
ordinary
interest
that
he
inquired
what
had
occurred
to
detain
them
from
his
society
.
 
<EOS>
In
reply
to
his
questions
on
this
point
,
Mr
Snodgrass
was
about
to
offer
an
historical
account
of
the
circumstances
just
now
detailed
,
when
he
was
suddenly
checked
by
observing
that
there
were
present
,
not
only
Mr
Tupman
and
their
stage
-
coach
companion
of
the
preceding
day
,
but
another
stranger
of
equally
singular
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
careworn
-
looking
man
,
whose
sallow
face
,
and
deeply
-
sunken
eyes
,
were
rendered
still
more
striking
than
Nature
had
made
them
,
by
the
straight
black
hair
which
hung
in
matted
disorder
half
-
way
down
his
face
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
almost
unnaturally
bright
and
piercing
;
his
cheek
-
bones
were
high
and
prominent
;
and
his
jaws
were
so
long
and
lank
,
that
an
observer
would
have
supposed
that
he
was
drawing
the
flesh
of
his
face
in
,
for
a
moment
,
by
some
contraction
of
the
muscles
,
if
his
half
-
opened
mouth
and
immovable
expression
had
not
announced
that
it
was
his
ordinary
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Round
his
neck
<EOS>
he
wore
a
green
shawl
,
with
the
large
ends
straggling
over
his
chest
,
and
making
their
appearance
occasionally
beneath
the
worn
button
-
holes
of
his
old
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
His
upper
garment
was
a
long
black
surtout
;
and
below
it
he
wore
wide
drab
trousers
,
and
large
boots
,
running
rapidly
to
seed
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
on
this
uncouth
-
looking
person
that
Mr
Winkle
's
eye
rested
,
and
it
was
towards
him
that
Mr
Pickwick
extended
his
hand
when
he
said
,
"
A
friend
of
our
friend
's
here
.
 
<EOS>
We
discovered
this
morning
that
our
friend
was
connected
with
the
theatre
in
this
place
,
though
he
is
not
desirous
to
have
it
generally
known
,
and
this
gentleman
is
a
member
of
the
same
profession
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
about
to
favour
us
with
a
little
anecdote
connected
with
it
,
when
you
entered
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Lots
of
anecdote
,
"
said
the
green
-
coated
stranger
of
the
day
before
,
advancing
to
Mr
Winkle
and
speaking
in
a
low
and
confidential
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rum
fellow
---
does
the
heavy
business
---
no
actor
---
<EOS>
strange
man
---
all
sorts
of
miseries
---
Dismal
Jemmy
<EOS>
,
we
call
him
on
the
circuit
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
and
Mr
Snodgrass
politely
welcomed
the
gentleman
,
elegantly
designated
as
"
Dismal
Jemmy
"
;
and
calling
for
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
in
imitation
of
the
remainder
of
the
company
,
seated
themselves
at
the
table
.
"
<EOS>
Now
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
will
you
oblige
us
by
proceeding
with
what
you
were
going
to
relate
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
dismal
individual
took
a
dirty
roll
of
paper
from
his
pocket
,
and
turning
to
Mr
Snodgrass
,
who
had
just
taken
out
his
note
-
book
,
said
in
a
hollow
voice
,
perfectly
in
keeping
with
his
outward
man
---
"
Are
you
the
poet
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
do
a
little
in
that
way
,
"
replied
Mr
Snodgrass
,
rather
taken
aback
by
the
abruptness
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
poetry
makes
life
what
light
and
music
do
the
stage
---
strip
the
one
of
the
false
embellishments
,
and
the
other
of
its
illusions
,
and
what
is
there
real
in
either
to
live
or
care
for
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
before
the
footlights
,
"
continued
the
dismal
man
,
"
is
like
sitting
at
a
grand
court
show
,
and
admiring
the
silken
dresses
of
the
gaudy
throng
;
to
be
behind
them
is
to
be
the
people
who
make
that
finery
,
uncared
for
and
unknown
,
and
left
to
sink
or
swim
,
to
starve
or
live
,
as
fortune
wills
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
:
for
the
sunken
eye
of
the
dismal
man
rested
on
him
,
and
he
felt
it
necessary
to
say
something
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
Jemmy
,
"
said
the
Spanish
traveller
,
"
like
<EOS>
black
-
eyed
Susan
---
all
in
the
Downs
---
no
croaking
---
speak
out
---
look
lively
.
"
<EOS>
"
Will
you
make
another
glass
before
you
begin
,
Sir
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
The
dismal
man
took
the
hint
,
and
having
mixed
a
glass
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
slowly
swallowed
half
of
it
,
opened
the
roll
of
paper
and
proceeded
,
partly
to
read
,
and
partly
to
relate
,
the
following
incident
,
which
we
find
recorded
on
the
Transactions
of
the
Club
as
"
The
Stroller
's
Tale
.
"
     
<EOS>
THE
STROLLER
'S
TALE
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
of
the
marvellous
in
what
I
am
going
to
relate
,
"
said
the
dismal
man
;
"
there
is
nothing
even
uncommon
in
it
.
<EOS>
Want
and
sickness
are
too
common
in
many
stations
of
life
to
deserve
more
notice
than
is
usually
bestowed
on
the
most
ordinary
vicissitudes
of
human
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
thrown
these
few
notes
together
,
because
the
subject
of
them
was
well
known
to
me
for
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
I
traced
his
progress
downwards
,
step
by
step
,
until
at
last
he
reached
that
excess
of
destitution
from
which
he
never
rose
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
man
of
whom
I
speak
was
a
low
pantomime
actor
;
and
,
like
many
people
of
his
class
,
an
habitual
drunkard
.
 
<EOS>
in
his
better
days
,
before
he
had
become
enfeebled
by
dissipation
and
emaciated
by
disease
,
he
had
been
in
the
receipt
of
a
good
salary
,
which
,
if
he
had
been
careful
and
prudent
,
he
might
have
continued
to
receive
for
some
years
---
not
many
;
because
these
men
either
die
early
,
or
by
unnaturally
taxing
their
bodily
energies
,
lose
,
prematurely
,
those
physical
powers
on
which
alone
they
can
depend
for
subsistence
.
 
<EOS>
His
besetting
sin
gained
so
fast
upon
him
,
however
,
that
it
was
found
impossible
to
employ
him
in
the
situations
in
which
he
really
was
useful
to
the
theatre
.
 
<EOS>
The
public
-
house
had
a
fascination
for
him
which
he
could
not
resist
.
<EOS>
Neglected
disease
and
hopeless
poverty
were
as
certain
to
be
his
portion
as
death
itself
,
if
he
persevered
in
the
same
course
;
yet
he
did
persevere
,
and
the
result
may
be
guessed
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
obtain
no
engagement
,
and
he
wanted
bread
.
<EOS>
"
Everybody
who
is
at
all
acquainted
with
theatrical
matters
knows
what
a
host
of
shabby
,
poverty
-
stricken
men
hang
about
the
stage
of
a
large
establishment
---
not
regularly
engaged
actors
,
but
ballet
people
,
procession
men
,
tumblers
,
and
so
forth
,
who
are
taken
on
during
the
run
of
a
pantomime
,
or
an
Easter
piece
,
and
are
then
discharged
,
until
the
production
of
some
heavy
spectacle
occasions
a
new
demand
for
their
services
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
mode
of
life
the
man
was
compelled
to
resort
;
and
taking
the
chair
every
night
,
at
some
low
theatrical
house
,
at
once
put
him
in
possession
of
a
few
more
shillings
weekly
,
and
enabled
him
to
gratify
his
old
propensity
.
 
<EOS>
Even
this
resource
shortly
failed
him
;
his
irregularities
were
too
great
to
admit
of
his
earning
the
wretched
pittance
he
might
thus
have
procured
,
and
he
was
actually
reduced
to
a
state
bordering
on
starvation
,
only
procuring
a
trifle
occasionally
by
borrowing
it
of
some
old
companion
,
or
by
obtaining
an
appearance
at
one
or
other
of
the
commonest
of
the
minor
theatres
;
and
when
he
did
earn
anything
it
was
spent
in
the
old
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
About
this
time
,
and
<EOS>
when
he
had
been
existing
for
upwards
of
a
year
no
one
knew
how
,
I
had
a
short
engagement
at
one
of
the
theatres
on
the
Surrey
side
of
the
water
,
and
here
I
saw
this
man
,
whom
I
had
lost
sight
of
for
some
time
;
for
I
had
been
travelling
in
the
provinces
,
and
he
had
been
skulking
in
the
lanes
and
alleys
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
dressed
to
leave
the
house
,
and
was
crossing
the
stage
on
my
way
out
,
when
he
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
Never
shall
I
forget
the
repulsive
sight
that
met
my
eye
when
I
turned
round
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
for
the
pantomimes
in
all
the
absurdity
of
a
clown
's
costume
.
 
<EOS>
The
spectral
figures
in
the
Dance
of
Death
,
the
most
frightful
shapes
that
the
ablest
painter
ever
portrayed
on
canvas
,
never
presented
an
appearance
half
so
ghastly
.
 
<EOS>
His
bloated
body
and
shrunken
legs
<EOS>
---
their
deformity
enhanced
a
hundredfold
by
the
fantastic
dress
---
the
glassy
eyes
,
contrasting
fearfully
with
the
thick
white
paint
with
which
the
face
was
besmeared
;
the
grotesquely
-
ornamented
head
,
trembling
with
paralysis
,
and
the
long
skinny
hands
,
rubbed
with
white
chalk
---
all
gave
him
a
hideous
and
unnatural
appearance
,
of
which
no
description
could
convey
an
adequate
idea
,
and
which
,
to
this
day
,
I
shudder
to
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
His
voice
was
hollow
and
tremulous
as
he
took
me
aside
,
and
in
broken
words
recounted
a
long
catalogue
of
sickness
and
privations
,
terminating
as
usual
with
an
urgent
request
for
the
loan
of
a
trifling
sum
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
a
few
shillings
in
his
hand
,
and
as
I
turned
away
<EOS>
I
heard
the
roar
of
laughter
which
followed
his
first
tumble
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
"
A
few
nights
afterwards
,
a
boy
put
a
dirty
scrap
of
paper
in
my
hand
,
on
which
were
scrawled
a
few
words
in
pencil
,
intimating
that
the
man
was
dangerously
ill
,
and
begging
me
,
after
the
performance
,
to
see
him
at
his
lodgings
in
some
street
<EOS>
---
I
forget
the
name
of
it
now
---
at
no
great
distance
from
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
I
promised
to
comply
,
as
soon
as
I
could
get
away
;
and
after
the
curtain
fell
,
sallied
forth
on
my
melancholy
errand
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
late
,
for
I
had
been
playing
in
the
last
piece
;
and
,
as
it
was
a
benefit
night
,
the
performances
had
been
protracted
to
an
unusual
length
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
dark
,
cold
night
,
with
a
chill
,
damp
wind
,
which
blew
the
rain
heavily
against
the
windows
and
house
-
fronts
.
<EOS>
Pools
of
water
had
collected
in
the
narrow
and
little
-
frequented
streets
,
and
as
many
of
the
thinly
-
scattered
oil
-
lamps
had
been
blown
out
by
the
violence
of
the
wind
,
the
walk
was
not
only
a
comfortless
,
but
most
uncertain
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
fortunately
taken
the
right
course
,
however
,
and
succeeded
,
after
a
little
difficulty
,
in
finding
the
house
to
which
I
had
been
directed
---
a
coal
-
shed
,
with
one
Storey
above
it
,
in
the
back
room
of
which
lay
the
object
of
my
search
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
wretched
-
looking
woman
,
the
man
's
wife
,
met
me
on
the
stairs
,
and
,
telling
me
that
he
had
just
fallen
into
a
kind
of
doze
,
led
me
softly
in
,
and
placed
a
chair
for
me
at
the
bedside
.
 
<EOS>
The
sick
man
was
lying
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
wall
;
and
as
he
took
no
heed
of
my
presence
,
I
had
leisure
to
observe
the
place
in
which
I
found
myself
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
lying
on
an
old
bedstead
,
which
turned
up
during
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
tattered
remains
of
a
checked
curtain
were
drawn
round
the
bed
's
head
,
to
exclude
the
wind
,
which
,
however
,
made
its
way
into
the
comfortless
room
through
the
numerous
chinks
in
the
door
,
and
blew
it
to
and
fro
every
instant
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
low
cinder
fire
in
a
rusty
,
unfixed
grate
;
and
an
old
three
-
cornered
stained
table
,
with
some
medicine
bottles
,
a
broken
glass
,
and
a
few
other
domestic
articles
,
was
drawn
out
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
child
was
sleeping
on
a
temporary
bed
which
had
been
made
for
it
on
the
floor
,
and
the
woman
sat
on
a
chair
by
its
side
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
a
couple
of
shelves
,
with
a
few
plates
and
cups
and
saucers
;
and
a
pair
of
stage
shoes
and
a
couple
of
foils
hung
beneath
them
.
<EOS>
With
the
exception
of
little
heaps
of
rags
and
bundles
which
had
been
carelessly
thrown
into
the
corners
of
the
room
,
these
were
the
only
things
in
the
apartment
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
had
time
to
note
these
little
particulars
,
and
to
mark
the
heavy
breathing
and
feverish
startings
of
the
sick
man
,
before
he
was
aware
of
my
presence
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
restless
attempts
to
procure
some
easy
resting
-
place
for
his
head
,
he
tossed
his
hand
out
of
the
bed
,
and
it
fell
on
mine
.
 
<EOS>
He
started
up
,
and
stared
eagerly
in
my
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Mr
Hutley
,
John
,
"
said
his
wife
;
"
Mr
Hutley
,
that
you
sent
for
to
-
night
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
Ah
!
"
said
the
invalid
,
passing
his
hand
across
his
forehead
;
"
Hutley
---
Hutley
---
let
me
see
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
endeavouring
to
collect
his
thoughts
for
a
few
seconds
,
and
then
grasping
me
tightly
by
the
wrist
said
,
"
Do
n't
leave
me
---
do
n't
leave
me
,
old
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
She
'll
murder
me
;
I
know
she
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
"
Has
he
been
long
so
?
"
said
I
,
addressing
his
weeping
wife
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Since
yesterday
night
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
John
,
John
,
do
n't
you
know
me
?
"
<EOS>
"
"
Do
n't
let
her
come
near
me
,
"
said
the
man
,
with
a
shudder
,
as
she
stooped
over
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Drive
her
away
;
I
ca
n't
bear
her
near
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
stared
wildly
at
her
,
with
a
look
of
deadly
apprehension
,
and
then
whispered
in
my
ear
,
"
I
beat
her
,
Jem
;
I
beat
her
yesterday
,
and
many
times
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
starved
her
and
the
boy
too
;
and
now
I
am
weak
and
helpless
,
Jem
,
she
'll
murder
me
for
it
;
I
know
she
will
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
'd
seen
her
cry
,
as
I
have
,
you
'd
know
it
too
.
 
<EOS>
Keep
her
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
relaxed
his
grasp
,
and
sank
back
exhausted
on
the
pillow
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
but
too
well
what
all
this
meant
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
have
entertained
any
doubt
of
it
,
for
an
instant
,
one
glance
at
the
woman
's
pale
face
and
wasted
form
would
have
sufficiently
explained
the
real
state
of
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
stand
aside
,
"
said
I
to
the
poor
creature
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
do
him
<EOS>
no
good
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
will
be
calmer
,
if
he
does
not
see
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
retired
out
of
the
man
's
sight
.
 
<EOS>
He
opened
his
eyes
after
a
few
seconds
,
and
looked
anxiously
round
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Is
she
gone
?
<EOS>
"
he
eagerly
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
---
yes
,
"
said
I
;
"
she
shall
not
hurt
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
Jem
,
"
said
the
man
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
she
does
hurt
me
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
something
in
her
eyes
wakes
such
a
dreadful
fear
in
my
heart
,
that
it
drives
me
mad
.
 
<EOS>
All
last
night
,
her
large
,
staring
eyes
and
pale
face
were
close
to
mine
;
wherever
I
turned
,
they
turned
;
and
whenever
I
started
up
from
my
sleep
,
she
was
at
the
bedside
looking
at
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
drew
me
closer
to
him
,
as
he
said
in
a
deep
alarmed
whisper
,
"
Jem
,
she
must
be
an
evil
spirit
---
a
devil
!
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
I
know
she
is
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
had
been
a
woman
she
would
have
died
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
No
woman
could
have
borne
what
she
has
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
sickened
at
the
thought
of
the
long
course
of
cruelty
and
neglect
which
must
have
occurred
to
produce
such
an
impression
on
such
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
say
nothing
in
reply
;
for
who
could
offer
hope
,
or
consolation
,
to
the
abject
being
before
me
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
sat
there
for
upwards
of
two
hours
,
during
which
time
he
tossed
about
,
murmuring
exclamations
of
pain
or
impatience
,
restlessly
throwing
his
arms
here
and
there
,
and
turning
constantly
from
side
to
side
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
fell
into
that
state
of
partial
unconsciousness
,
in
which
the
mind
wanders
uneasily
from
scene
to
scene
,
and
from
place
to
place
,
without
the
control
of
reason
,
but
still
without
being
able
to
divest
itself
of
an
indescribable
sense
of
present
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
from
his
incoherent
wanderings
that
this
was
the
case
,
and
knowing
that
in
all
probability
the
fever
would
not
grow
immediately
worse
<EOS>
,
I
left
him
,
promising
his
miserable
wife
that
I
would
repeat
my
visit
next
evening
,
and
,
if
necessary
,
sit
up
with
the
patient
during
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
kept
my
promise
.
 
<EOS>
The
last
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
had
produced
a
frightful
alteration
.
 
<EOS>
The
eyes
,
though
deeply
sunk
and
heavy
,
shone
with
a
lustre
frightful
to
behold
.
 
<EOS>
The
lips
were
parched
,
and
cracked
in
many
places
;
the
hard
,
dry
skin
glowed
with
a
burning
heat
;
and
there
was
an
almost
unearthly
air
of
wild
anxiety
in
the
man
's
face
,
indicating
even
more
strongly
the
ravages
of
the
disease
.
 
<EOS>
The
fever
was
at
its
height
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
took
the
seat
I
had
occupied
the
night
before
,
and
there
I
sat
for
hours
,
listening
to
sounds
which
must
strike
deep
to
the
heart
of
the
most
callous
among
human
beings
---
the
awful
ravings
of
a
dying
man
.
 
<EOS>
From
what
I
had
heard
of
the
medical
attendant
's
opinion
,
I
knew
there
was
no
hope
for
him
:
I
was
sitting
by
his
death
-
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
wasted
limbs
---
which
a
few
hours
before
had
been
distorted
for
the
amusement
of
a
boisterous
gallery
,
writhing
under
the
tortures
of
a
burning
fever
<EOS>
---
I
heard
the
clown
's
shrill
laugh
,
blending
with
the
low
murmurings
of
the
dying
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
touching
thing
to
hear
the
mind
reverting
to
the
ordinary
occupations
and
pursuits
of
health
,
when
the
body
lies
before
you
weak
and
helpless
;
but
when
those
occupations
are
of
a
character
the
most
strongly
opposed
to
anything
we
associate
with
grave
and
solemn
ideas
,
the
impression
produced
is
infinitely
more
powerful
.
 
<EOS>
The
theatre
and
the
public
-
house
were
the
chief
themes
of
the
wretched
man
's
wanderings
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
evening
,
he
fancied
;
he
had
a
part
to
play
that
night
;
it
was
late
,
and
he
must
leave
home
instantly
.
 
<EOS>
Why
did
they
hold
him
,
and
prevent
his
going
?
<EOS>
---
he
should
lose
the
money
---
he
must
go
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
they
would
not
let
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
hid
his
face
in
his
burning
hands
,
and
feebly
bemoaned
his
own
weakness
,
and
the
cruelty
of
his
persecutors
.
 
<EOS>
A
short
pause
,
and
<EOS>
he
shouted
out
a
few
doggerel
rhymes
---
the
last
he
had
ever
learned
.
 
<EOS>
He
rose
in
bed
,
drew
up
his
withered
limbs
,
and
rolled
about
in
uncouth
positions
;
he
was
acting
---
he
was
at
the
theatre
.
 
<EOS>
A
minute
's
silence
,
and
he
murmured
the
burden
of
some
roaring
song
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
reached
the
old
house
at
last
---
how
hot
the
room
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
ill
,
very
ill
,
but
he
was
well
now
,
and
happy
.
 
<EOS>
Fill
up
his
glass
.
 
<EOS>
Who
was
that
,
that
dashed
it
from
his
lips
?
<EOS>
It
was
the
same
persecutor
that
had
followed
him
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
fell
back
upon
his
pillow
and
moaned
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
A
short
period
of
oblivion
,
and
he
was
wandering
through
a
tedious
maze
of
low
-
arched
rooms
---
<EOS>
so
low
,
sometimes
,
that
he
must
creep
upon
his
hands
and
knees
to
make
his
way
along
;
it
was
close
and
dark
,
and
every
way
he
turned
,
some
obstacle
impeded
his
progress
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
insects
,
too
,
hideous
crawling
things
,
with
eyes
that
stared
upon
him
,
and
filled
the
very
air
around
,
glistening
horribly
amidst
the
thick
darkness
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
The
walls
and
ceiling
were
alive
with
reptiles
---
the
vault
expanded
to
an
enormous
size
---
frightful
figures
flitted
to
and
fro
---
and
the
faces
of
men
he
knew
,
rendered
hideous
by
gibing
and
mouthing
,
peered
out
from
among
them
;
they
were
searing
him
with
heated
irons
,
and
binding
his
head
with
cords
till
the
blood
started
;
and
he
struggled
madly
for
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
the
close
of
one
of
these
paroxysms
,
when
I
had
with
great
difficulty
held
him
down
in
his
bed
,
he
sank
into
what
appeared
to
be
a
slumber
.
 
<EOS>
Overpowered
with
watching
and
exertion
,
I
had
closed
my
eyes
for
a
few
minutes
,
when
I
felt
a
violent
clutch
on
my
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
I
awoke
instantly
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
raised
himself
up
,
so
as
to
seat
himself
in
bed
---
a
dreadful
change
had
come
over
his
face
,
but
consciousness
had
returned
,
for
he
evidently
knew
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
child
,
who
had
been
long
since
disturbed
by
his
ravings
,
rose
from
its
little
bed
,
and
ran
towards
its
father
,
screaming
with
fright
---
the
mother
hastily
caught
it
in
her
arms
,
lest
he
should
injure
it
in
the
violence
of
his
insanity
;
but
,
terrified
by
the
alteration
of
his
features
,
stood
transfixed
by
the
bedside
.
 
<EOS>
He
grasped
my
shoulder
convulsively
,
and
,
striking
his
breast
with
the
other
hand
,
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
articulate
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
unavailing
;
he
extended
his
arm
towards
them
,
and
made
another
violent
effort
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
rattling
noise
in
the
throat
---
a
glare
of
the
eye
---
a
short
stifled
groan
---
and
he
fell
back
---
dead
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
would
afford
us
the
highest
gratification
to
be
enabled
to
record
Mr
Pickwick
's
opinion
of
the
foregoing
anecdote
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
little
doubt
that
we
should
have
been
enabled
to
present
it
to
our
readers
,
but
for
a
most
unfortunate
occurrence
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
had
replaced
on
the
table
the
glass
which
,
during
the
last
few
sentences
of
the
tale
,
he
had
retained
in
his
hand
;
and
had
just
made
up
his
mind
to
speak
---
indeed
,
we
have
the
authority
of
Mr
Snodgrass
's
note
-
book
for
stating
,
that
he
had
actually
opened
his
mouth
---
when
the
waiter
entered
the
room
,
and
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
Some
gentlemen
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
has
been
conjectured
that
Mr
Pickwick
was
on
the
point
of
delivering
some
remarks
which
would
have
enlightened
the
world
,
if
not
the
Thames
,
when
he
was
thus
interrupted
;
for
he
gazed
sternly
on
the
waiter
's
countenance
,
and
then
looked
round
on
the
company
generally
,
as
if
seeking
for
information
relative
to
the
new
-
comers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
rising
,
"
some
friends
of
mine
---
show
them
in
.
 
<EOS>
Very
pleasant
fellows
,
"
added
Mr
Winkle
,
after
the
waiter
had
retired
---
"
officers
of
the
97th
,
whose
acquaintance
I
made
rather
oddly
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
like
them
very
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
equanimity
was
at
once
restored
.
 
<EOS>
The
waiter
returned
,
and
ushered
three
gentlemen
into
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lieutenant
Tappleton
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
"
Lieutenant
Tappleton
,
Mr
Pickwick
---
Doctor
Payne
,
Mr
Pickwick
---
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
you
have
seen
before
,
my
friend
Mr
Tupman
,
Doctor
Payne
---
Doctor
Slammer
,
Mr
Pickwick
---
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
,
Doctor
Slam
---
"
   
Here
Mr
Winkle
suddenly
paused
;
for
strong
emotion
was
visible
on
the
countenance
both
of
Mr
Tupman
and
the
doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
met
THIS
gentleman
before
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
with
marked
emphasis
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
---
and
that
person
,
too
,
if
I
am
not
mistaken
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
bestowing
a
scrutinising
glance
on
the
green
-
coated
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
gave
that
person
a
very
pressing
invitation
last
night
,
which
he
thought
proper
to
decline
.
"
 
<EOS>
Saying
which
the
doctor
scowled
magnanimously
on
the
stranger
,
and
whispered
his
friend
Lieutenant
Tappleton
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
say
so
,
"
said
that
gentleman
,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
whisper
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
indeed
,
"
replied
Doctor
Slammer
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
bound
to
kick
him
on
the
spot
,
"
murmured
the
owner
of
the
camp
-
stool
,
with
great
importance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
be
quiet
,
Payne
,
"
interposed
the
lieutenant
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
allow
me
to
ask
you
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
addressing
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
was
considerably
mystified
by
this
very
unpolite
by
-
play
---
"
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
you
,
Sir
,
whether
that
person
belongs
to
your
party
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
he
is
a
guest
of
ours
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
member
of
your
club
,
or
I
am
mistaken
?
"
said
the
lieutenant
inquiringly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
responded
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
never
wears
your
club
-
button
?
"
said
the
lieutenant
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
---
never
!
"
replied
the
astonished
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
Lieutenant
Tappleton
turned
round
to
his
friend
Doctor
Slammer
,
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
shrug
of
the
shoulder
,
as
if
implying
some
doubt
of
the
accuracy
of
his
recollection
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
doctor
looked
wrathful
,
but
confounded
;
and
Mr
Payne
gazed
with
a
ferocious
aspect
on
the
beaming
countenance
of
the
unconscious
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
suddenly
addressing
Mr
Tupman
,
in
a
tone
which
made
that
gentleman
start
as
perceptibly
as
if
a
pin
had
been
cunningly
inserted
in
the
calf
of
his
leg
,
"
you
were
at
the
ball
here
last
night
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
gasped
a
faint
affirmative
,
looking
very
hard
at
Mr
Pickwick
all
the
while
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
person
was
your
companion
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
pointing
to
the
still
unmoved
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
admitted
the
fact
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
sir
,
"
said
the
doctor
to
the
stranger
,
"
I
ask
you
once
again
,
in
the
presence
of
these
gentlemen
,
whether
you
choose
to
give
me
your
card
,
and
to
receive
the
treatment
of
a
gentleman
;
or
whether
you
impose
upon
me
the
necessity
of
personally
chastising
you
on
the
spot
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
I
really
can
not
allow
this
matter
to
go
any
further
without
some
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
Tupman
,
recount
the
circumstances
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
,
thus
solemnly
adjured
,
stated
the
case
in
a
few
words
;
touched
slightly
on
the
borrowing
of
the
coat
;
expatiated
largely
on
its
having
been
done
"
after
dinner
"
;
wound
up
with
a
little
penitence
on
his
own
account
;
and
left
the
stranger
to
clear
himself
as
best
he
could
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
apparently
about
to
proceed
to
do
so
,
when
Lieutenant
Tappleton
,
who
had
been
eyeing
him
with
great
curiosity
,
said
with
considerable
scorn
,
"
Have
n't
I
seen
you
at
the
theatre
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
replied
the
unabashed
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
a
strolling
actor
!
"
said
the
lieutenant
contemptuously
,
turning
to
Doctor
Slammer
.
---
"
He
acts
in
the
piece
that
the
officers
of
the
52nd
get
up
at
the
Rochester
Theatre
to
-
morrow
night
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
proceed
in
this
affair
,
Slammer
---
impossible
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
!
"
said
the
dignified
Payne
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sorry
to
have
placed
you
in
this
disagreeable
situation
,
"
said
Lieutenant
Tappleton
,
addressing
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
allow
me
to
suggest
,
that
the
best
way
of
avoiding
a
recurrence
of
such
scenes
in
future
will
be
to
be
more
select
in
the
choice
of
your
companions
.
<EOS>
Good
-
evening
,
Sir
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
lieutenant
bounced
out
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
allow
me
to
say
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
irascible
Doctor
Payne
,
"
that
if
I
had
been
Tappleton
,
or
if
I
had
been
Slammer
,
I
would
have
pulled
your
nose
,
Sir
,
and
the
nose
of
every
man
in
this
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
,
sir
---
<EOS>
every
man
.
 
<EOS>
Payne
is
my
name
,
sir
---
Doctor
Payne
of
the
43rd
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
evening
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Having
concluded
this
speech
,
and
uttered
the
last
three
words
in
a
loud
key
,
he
stalked
majestically
after
his
friend
,
closely
followed
by
Doctor
Slammer
,
who
said
nothing
,
but
contented
himself
by
withering
the
company
with
a
look
.
<EOS>
Rising
rage
and
extreme
bewilderment
had
swelled
the
noble
breast
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
almost
to
the
bursting
of
his
waistcoat
,
during
the
delivery
of
the
above
defiance
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
transfixed
to
the
spot
,
gazing
on
vacancy
.
 
<EOS>
The
closing
of
the
door
recalled
him
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
rushed
forward
with
fury
in
his
looks
,
and
fire
in
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
His
hand
was
upon
the
lock
of
the
door
;
in
another
instant
it
would
have
been
on
the
throat
of
Doctor
Payne
of
the
43rd
,
had
not
Mr
Snodgrass
seized
his
revered
leader
by
the
coat
tail
,
and
dragged
him
backwards
.
   
<EOS>
"
Restrain
him
,
"
cried
Mr
Snodgrass
;
"
Winkle
,
Tupman
---
he
must
not
peril
his
distinguished
life
in
such
a
cause
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
him
tight
,
"
shouted
Mr
Snodgrass
;
and
by
the
united
efforts
of
the
whole
company
,
Mr
Pickwick
was
forced
into
an
arm
-
chair
.
"
<EOS>
Leave
him
alone
,
"
said
the
green
-
coated
stranger
;
"
brandy
-
and
-
water
---
jolly
old
gentleman
---
lots
of
pluck
---
swallow
this
---
ah
!
---
capital
stuff
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Having
previously
tested
the
virtues
of
a
bumper
,
which
had
been
mixed
by
the
dismal
man
,
the
stranger
applied
the
glass
to
Mr
Pickwick
's
mouth
;
and
the
remainder
of
its
contents
rapidly
disappeared
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
short
pause
;
the
brandy
-
and
-
water
had
done
its
work
;
the
amiable
countenance
of
Mr
Pickwick
was
fast
recovering
its
customary
expression
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
are
not
worth
your
notice
,
"
said
the
dismal
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
they
are
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
ashamed
to
have
been
betrayed
into
this
warmth
of
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
Draw
your
chair
up
to
the
table
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
dismal
man
readily
complied
;
a
circle
was
again
formed
round
the
table
,
and
harmony
once
more
prevailed
.
 
<EOS>
Some
lingering
irritability
appeared
to
find
a
resting
-
place
in
Mr
Winkle
's
bosom
,
occasioned
possibly
by
the
temporary
abstraction
of
his
coat
---
though
it
is
scarcely
reasonable
to
suppose
that
so
slight
a
circumstance
can
have
excited
even
a
passing
feeling
of
anger
in
a
Pickwickian
's
breast
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
exception
,
their
good
-
humour
was
completely
restored
;
and
the
evening
concluded
with
the
conviviality
with
which
it
had
begun
.

A
field
day
and
bivouac
---
more
new
friends
---
an
invitation
to
the
country
 
<EOS>
Many
authors
entertain
,
not
only
a
foolish
,
but
a
really
dishonest
objection
to
acknowledge
the
sources
<EOS>
whence
they
derive
much
valuable
information
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
such
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
merely
endeavouring
to
discharge
,
in
an
upright
manner
,
the
responsible
duties
of
our
editorial
functions
;
and
whatever
ambition
we
might
have
felt
under
other
circumstances
to
lay
claim
to
the
authorship
of
these
adventures
,
a
regard
for
truth
forbids
us
to
do
more
than
claim
the
merit
of
their
judicious
arrangement
and
impartial
narration
.
 
<EOS>
The
Pickwick
papers
are
our
New
River
Head
;
and
we
may
be
compared
to
the
New
River
Company
.
 
<EOS>
The
labours
of
others
have
raised
for
us
an
immense
reservoir
of
important
facts
.
 
<EOS>
We
merely
lay
them
on
,
and
communicate
them
,
in
a
clear
and
gentle
stream
,
through
the
medium
of
these
pages
,
to
a
world
thirsting
for
Pickwickian
knowledge
.
   
<EOS>
Acting
in
this
spirit
,
and
resolutely
proceeding
on
our
determination
to
avow
our
obligations
to
the
authorities
we
have
consulted
<EOS>
,
we
frankly
say
,
that
to
the
note
-
book
of
Mr
Snodgrass
are
we
indebted
for
the
particulars
recorded
in
this
and
the
succeeding
chapter
---
particulars
which
,
now
that
we
have
disburdened
our
consciences
,
we
shall
proceed
to
detail
without
further
comment
.
   
<EOS>
The
whole
population
of
Rochester
and
the
adjoining
towns
rose
from
their
beds
at
an
early
hour
of
the
following
morning
,
in
a
state
of
the
utmost
bustle
and
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
A
grand
review
was
to
take
place
upon
the
lines
.
 
<EOS>
The
manoeuvres
of
half
a
dozen
regiments
were
to
be
inspected
by
the
eagle
eye
of
the
commander
-
in
-
chief
;
temporary
fortifications
had
been
erected
,
the
citadel
was
to
be
attacked
and
taken
,
and
a
mine
was
to
be
sprung
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
,
as
our
readers
may
have
gathered
from
the
slight
extract
we
gave
from
his
description
of
Chatham
,
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
the
army
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
could
have
been
more
delightful
to
him
---
nothing
could
have
harmonised
so
well
with
the
peculiar
feeling
of
each
of
his
companions
---
as
this
sight
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
they
were
soon
afoot
,
and
walking
in
the
direction
of
the
scene
of
action
,
towards
which
crowds
of
people
were
already
pouring
from
a
variety
of
quarters
.
   
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
everything
on
the
lines
denoted
that
the
approaching
ceremony
was
one
of
the
utmost
grandeur
and
importance
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
sentries
posted
to
keep
the
ground
for
the
troops
,
and
servants
on
the
batteries
keeping
places
for
the
ladies
,
and
sergeants
running
to
and
fro
,
with
vellum
-
covered
books
under
their
arms
,
and
Colonel
Bulder
,
in
full
military
uniform
,
on
horseback
,
galloping
first
to
one
place
and
then
to
another
,
and
backing
his
horse
among
the
people
,
and
prancing
,
and
curvetting
,
and
shouting
in
a
most
alarming
manner
,
and
making
himself
very
hoarse
in
the
voice
,
and
very
red
in
the
face
,
without
any
assignable
cause
or
reason
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
Officers
were
running
backwards
and
forwards
,
first
communicating
with
Colonel
Bulder
,
and
then
ordering
the
sergeants
,
and
then
running
away
altogether
;
and
even
the
very
privates
themselves
looked
from
behind
their
glazed
stocks
with
an
air
of
mysterious
solemnity
,
which
sufficiently
bespoke
the
special
nature
of
the
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
three
companions
stationed
themselves
in
the
front
of
the
crowd
,
and
patiently
awaited
the
commencement
of
the
proceedings
.
 
<EOS>
The
throng
was
increasing
every
moment
;
and
the
efforts
they
were
compelled
to
make
,
to
retain
the
position
they
had
gained
,
sufficiently
occupied
their
attention
during
the
two
hours
that
ensued
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
time
there
was
a
sudden
pressure
from
behind
,
and
then
Mr
Pickwick
was
jerked
forward
for
several
yards
,
with
a
degree
of
speed
and
elasticity
highly
inconsistent
with
the
general
gravity
of
his
demeanour
;
at
another
moment
there
was
a
request
to
"
keep
back
"
from
the
front
,
and
then
the
butt
-
end
of
a
musket
was
either
dropped
upon
Mr
Pickwick
's
toe
,
to
remind
him
of
the
demand
,
or
thrust
into
his
chest
,
to
insure
its
being
complied
with
.
 
<EOS>
Then
some
facetious
gentlemen
on
the
left
,
after
pressing
sideways
in
a
body
,
and
squeezing
Mr
Snodgrass
into
the
very
last
extreme
of
human
torture
,
would
request
to
know
"
vere
he
vos
a
shovin
'
to
"
;
and
when
Mr
Winkle
had
done
expressing
his
excessive
indignation
at
witnessing
this
unprovoked
assault
,
some
person
behind
would
knock
his
hat
over
his
eyes
,
and
beg
the
favour
of
his
putting
his
head
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
These
,
and
other
practical
witticisms
,
coupled
with
the
unaccountable
absence
of
Mr
Tupman
(
who
had
suddenly
disappeared
,
and
was
nowhere
to
be
found
)
,
rendered
their
situation
upon
the
whole
rather
more
uncomfortable
than
pleasing
or
desirable
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
that
low
roar
of
many
voices
ran
through
the
crowd
which
usually
announces
the
arrival
of
whatever
they
have
been
waiting
for
.
 
<EOS>
All
eyes
were
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
sally
-
port
.
<EOS>
A
few
moments
of
eager
expectation
,
and
colours
were
seen
fluttering
gaily
in
the
air
,
arms
glistened
brightly
in
the
sun
,
column
after
column
poured
on
to
the
plain
.
 
<EOS>
The
troops
halted
and
formed
;
the
word
of
command
rang
through
the
line
;
there
was
a
general
clash
of
muskets
as
arms
were
presented
;
and
the
commander
-
in
-
chief
,
attended
by
Colonel
Bulder
and
numerous
officers
,
cantered
to
the
front
.
 
<EOS>
The
military
bands
struck
up
altogether
;
the
horses
stood
upon
two
legs
each
,
cantered
backwards
,
and
whisked
their
tails
about
in
all
directions
;
the
dogs
barked
,
the
mob
screamed
,
the
troops
recovered
,
and
nothing
was
to
be
seen
on
either
side
,
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
,
but
a
long
perspective
of
red
coats
and
white
trousers
,
fixed
and
motionless
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
had
been
so
fully
occupied
in
falling
about
,
and
disentangling
himself
,
miraculously
,
from
between
the
legs
of
horses
,
that
he
had
not
enjoyed
sufficient
leisure
to
observe
the
scene
before
him
,
until
it
assumed
the
appearance
we
have
just
described
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
at
last
enabled
to
stand
firmly
on
his
legs
,
his
gratification
and
delight
were
unbounded
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
anything
be
finer
or
more
delightful
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
of
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
replied
that
gentleman
,
who
had
had
a
short
man
standing
on
each
of
his
feet
for
the
quarter
of
an
hour
immediately
preceding
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
indeed
a
noble
and
a
brilliant
sight
,
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
,
in
whose
bosom
a
blaze
of
poetry
was
rapidly
bursting
forth
,
"
to
see
the
gallant
defenders
of
their
country
drawn
up
in
brilliant
array
before
its
peaceful
citizens
;
their
faces
beaming
---
not
with
warlike
ferocity
,
but
with
civilised
gentleness
;
their
eyes
flashing
 
---
not
with
the
rude
fire
of
rapine
or
revenge
,
but
with
the
soft
light
of
humanity
and
intelligence
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
fully
entered
into
the
spirit
of
this
eulogium
,
but
he
could
not
exactly
re
-
echo
its
terms
;
for
the
soft
light
of
intelligence
burned
rather
feebly
in
the
eyes
of
the
warriors
,
inasmuch
as
the
command
"
eyes
front
"
had
been
given
,
and
all
the
spectator
saw
before
him
was
several
thousand
pair
of
optics
,
staring
straight
forward
,
wholly
divested
of
any
expression
whatever
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
in
a
capital
situation
now
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
round
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
crowd
had
gradually
dispersed
in
their
immediate
vicinity
,
and
they
were
nearly
alone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Capital
!
"
echoed
both
Mr
Snodgrass
and
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
they
doing
now
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
,
adjusting
his
spectacles
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
---
rather
think
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
changing
colour
---
"
<EOS>
I
rather
think
they
're
going
to
fire
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
hastily
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
---
really
think
they
are
,
"
urged
Mr
Snodgrass
,
somewhat
alarmed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Impossible
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
hardly
uttered
the
word
,
when
the
whole
half
-
dozen
regiments
levelled
their
muskets
as
if
they
had
but
one
common
object
,
and
that
object
the
Pickwickians
,
and
burst
forth
with
the
most
awful
and
tremendous
discharge
that
ever
shook
the
earth
to
its
centres
,
or
an
elderly
gentleman
off
his
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
in
this
trying
situation
,
exposed
to
a
galling
fire
of
blank
cartridges
,
and
harassed
by
the
operations
of
the
military
<EOS>
,
a
fresh
body
of
whom
had
begun
to
fall
in
on
the
opposite
side
,
that
Mr
Pickwick
displayed
that
perfect
coolness
and
self
-
possession
,
which
are
the
indispensable
accompaniments
of
a
great
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
seized
Mr
Winkle
by
the
arm
,
and
placing
himself
between
that
gentleman
and
Mr
Snodgrass
,
earnestly
besought
them
to
remember
that
beyond
the
possibility
of
being
rendered
deaf
by
the
noise
,
there
was
no
immediate
danger
to
be
apprehended
from
the
firing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
---
but
---
suppose
some
of
the
men
should
happen
to
have
ball
cartridges
by
mistake
,
"
remonstrated
Mr
Winkle
,
pallid
at
the
supposition
he
was
himself
conjuring
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
heard
something
whistle
through
the
air
now
---
so
sharp
;
close
to
my
ear
.
"
<EOS>
"
We
had
better
throw
ourselves
on
our
faces
,
had
n't
we
?
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
---
it
's
over
now
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
His
lip
might
quiver
,
and
his
cheek
might
blanch
,
but
no
expression
of
fear
or
concern
escaped
the
lips
of
that
immortal
man
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
right
---
the
firing
ceased
;
but
he
had
scarcely
time
to
congratulate
himself
on
the
accuracy
of
his
opinion
,
when
a
quick
movement
was
visible
in
the
line
;
the
hoarse
shout
of
the
word
of
command
ran
along
it
,
and
before
either
of
the
party
could
form
a
guess
at
the
meaning
of
this
new
manoeuvre
,
the
whole
of
the
half
-
dozen
regiments
,
with
fixed
bayonets
,
charged
at
double
-
quick
time
down
upon
the
very
spot
on
which
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
friends
were
stationed
.
<EOS>
Man
is
but
mortal
;
and
there
is
a
point
beyond
which
human
courage
can
not
extend
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
gazed
through
his
spectacles
for
an
instant
on
the
advancing
mass
,
and
then
fairly
turned
his
back
and
---
we
will
not
say
fled
;
firstly
,
because
it
is
an
ignoble
term
,
and
,
secondly
,
because
Mr
Pickwick
's
figure
was
by
no
means
adapted
for
that
mode
of
retreat
---
he
trotted
away
,
at
as
quick
a
rate
as
his
legs
would
convey
him
;
so
quickly
,
indeed
,
that
he
did
not
perceive
the
awkwardness
of
his
situation
,
to
the
full
extent
,
until
too
late
.
   
<EOS>
The
opposite
troops
,
whose
falling
-
in
had
perplexed
Mr
Pickwick
a
few
seconds
before
,
were
drawn
up
to
repel
the
mimic
attack
of
the
sham
besiegers
of
the
citadel
;
and
the
consequence
was
that
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
two
companions
found
themselves
suddenly
inclosed
between
two
lines
of
great
length
,
the
one
advancing
at
a
rapid
pace
,
and
the
other
firmly
waiting
the
collision
in
hostile
array
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hoi
!
"
shouted
the
officers
of
the
advancing
line
.
   
<EOS>
"
Get
out
of
the
way
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
officers
of
the
stationary
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
are
we
to
go
to
?
<EOS>
"
screamed
the
agitated
Pickwickians
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hoi
---
hoi
---
hoi
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
only
reply
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
moment
of
intense
bewilderment
,
a
heavy
tramp
of
footsteps
,
a
violent
concussion
,
a
smothered
laugh
;
the
half
-
dozen
regiments
were
half
a
thousand
yards
off
,
and
the
soles
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
boots
were
elevated
in
air
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
and
Mr
Winkle
had
each
performed
a
compulsory
somerset
with
remarkable
agility
,
when
the
first
object
that
met
the
eyes
of
the
latter
as
he
sat
on
the
ground
,
staunching
with
a
yellow
silk
handkerchief
the
stream
of
life
which
issued
from
his
nose
,
was
his
venerated
leader
at
some
distance
off
,
running
after
his
own
hat
,
which
was
gambolling
playfully
away
in
perspective
.
   
<EOS>
There
are
very
few
moments
in
a
man
's
existence
when
he
experiences
so
much
ludicrous
distress
,
or
meets
with
so
little
charitable
commiseration
,
as
when
he
is
in
pursuit
of
his
own
hat
.
<EOS>
A
vast
deal
of
coolness
,
and
a
peculiar
degree
of
judgment
,
are
requisite
in
catching
a
hat
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
must
not
be
precipitate
,
or
he
runs
over
it
;
he
must
not
rush
into
the
opposite
extreme
,
or
he
loses
it
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
The
best
way
is
to
keep
gently
up
with
the
object
of
pursuit
,
to
be
wary
and
cautious
,
to
watch
your
opportunity
well
,
get
gradually
before
it
,
then
make
a
rapid
dive
,
seize
it
by
the
crown
,
and
stick
it
firmly
on
your
head
;
smiling
pleasantly
all
the
time
,
as
if
you
thought
it
as
good
a
joke
as
anybody
else
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
fine
gentle
wind
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
's
hat
rolled
sportively
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
wind
puffed
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
puffed
,
and
the
hat
rolled
over
and
over
as
merrily
as
a
lively
porpoise
in
a
strong
tide
:
and
on
it
might
have
rolled
,
far
beyond
Mr
Pickwick
's
reach
,
<EOS>
had
not
its
course
been
providentially
stopped
,
just
as
that
gentleman
was
on
the
point
of
resigning
it
to
its
fate
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
we
say
,
was
completely
exhausted
,
and
about
to
give
up
the
chase
,
when
the
hat
was
blown
with
some
violence
against
the
wheel
of
a
carriage
,
which
was
drawn
up
in
a
line
with
half
a
dozen
other
vehicles
on
the
spot
to
which
his
steps
had
been
directed
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
perceiving
his
advantage
,
darted
briskly
forward
,
secured
his
property
,
planted
it
on
his
head
,
and
paused
to
take
breath
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
stationary
half
a
minute
,
when
he
heard
his
own
name
eagerly
pronounced
by
a
voice
,
which
he
at
once
recognised
as
Mr
Tupman
's
,
and
,
looking
upwards
,
he
beheld
a
sight
which
filled
him
with
surprise
and
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
in
an
open
barouche
,
the
horses
of
which
had
been
taken
out
,
the
better
to
accommodate
it
to
the
crowded
place
,
stood
a
stout
old
gentleman
,
in
a
blue
coat
and
bright
buttons
,
corduroy
breeches
and
top
-
boots
,
two
young
ladies
in
scarfs
and
feathers
,
a
young
gentleman
apparently
enamoured
of
one
of
the
young
ladies
in
scarfs
and
feathers
,
a
lady
of
doubtful
age
,
probably
the
aunt
of
the
aforesaid
,
and
Mr
Tupman
,
as
easy
and
unconcerned
as
if
he
had
belonged
to
the
family
from
the
first
moments
of
his
infancy
.
 
<EOS>
Fastened
up
behind
the
barouche
<EOS>
was
a
hamper
of
spacious
dimensions
---
one
of
those
hampers
which
always
awakens
in
a
contemplative
mind
associations
connected
with
cold
fowls
,
tongues
,
and
bottles
of
wine
---
and
on
the
box
sat
a
fat
and
red
-
faced
boy
,
in
a
state
of
somnolency
,
whom
no
speculative
observer
could
have
regarded
for
an
instant
without
setting
down
as
the
official
dispenser
of
the
contents
of
the
before
-
mentioned
hamper
,
when
the
proper
time
for
their
consumption
should
arrive
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
had
bestowed
a
hasty
glance
on
these
interesting
objects
,
when
he
was
again
greeted
by
his
faithful
disciple
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pickwick
---
Pickwick
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
;
"
come
up
here
.
 
<EOS>
Make
haste
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
along
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
come
up
,
"
said
the
stout
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Joe
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
damn
that
boy
,
he
's
gone
to
sleep
again
.
<EOS>
---
Joe
,
let
down
the
steps
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
rolled
slowly
off
the
box
,
let
down
the
steps
,
and
held
the
carriage
door
invitingly
open
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
and
Mr
Winkle
came
up
at
the
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Room
for
you
all
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
the
stout
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Two
inside
,
and
one
out
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
,
make
room
for
one
of
these
gentlemen
on
the
box
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Sir
,
come
along
;
"
and
the
stout
gentleman
extended
his
arm
,
and
pulled
first
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
then
Mr
Snodgrass
,
into
the
barouche
by
main
force
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
mounted
to
the
box
,
the
fat
boy
waddled
to
the
same
perch
,
and
fell
fast
asleep
instantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
the
stout
man
,
"
very
glad
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
Know
you
very
well
,
gentlemen
,
though
you
may
n't
remember
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
spent
some
ev'nin
's
at
your
club
last
winter
---
<EOS>
picked
up
my
friend
Mr
Tupman
here
this
morning
,
and
very
glad
I
was
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Sir
,
and
how
are
you
?
<EOS>
You
do
look
uncommon
well
,
to
be
sure
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
acknowledged
the
compliment
,
and
cordially
shook
hands
with
the
stout
gentleman
in
the
top
-
boots
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
how
are
you
,
sir
?
"
said
the
stout
gentleman
,
addressing
Mr
Snodgrass
with
paternal
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
"
Charming
,
eh
?
<EOS>
Well
,
that
's
right
<EOS>
---
that
's
right
.
 
<EOS>
And
how
are
you
,
sir
(
to
Mr
Winkle
)
?
<EOS>
Well
,
I
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
you
are
well
;
very
glad
I
am
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
My
daughters
,
gentlemen
---
my
gals
<EOS>
these
are
;
and
that
's
my
sister
,
Miss
Rachael
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
a
Miss
,
she
is
;
and
yet
she
ai
n't
a
Miss
---
<EOS>
eh
,
Sir
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
And
the
stout
gentleman
playfully
inserted
his
elbow
between
the
ribs
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
laughed
very
heartily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
,
brother
!
"
said
Miss
Wardle
,
with
a
deprecating
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
True
,
true
,
"
said
the
stout
gentleman
;
"
no
one
can
deny
it
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
I
beg
your
pardon
;
this
is
my
friend
Mr
Trundle
.
<EOS>
And
now
you
all
know
each
other
,
let
's
be
comfortable
and
happy
,
and
see
what
's
going
forward
;
that
's
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
the
stout
gentleman
put
on
his
spectacles
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
pulled
out
his
glass
,
and
everybody
stood
up
in
the
carriage
,
and
looked
over
somebody
else
's
shoulder
at
the
evolutions
of
the
military
.
   
<EOS>
Astounding
evolutions
they
were
,
one
rank
firing
over
the
heads
of
another
rank
,
and
then
running
away
;
and
then
the
other
rank
firing
over
the
heads
of
another
rank
,
and
running
away
in
their
turn
;
and
then
forming
squares
,
with
officers
in
the
centre
;
and
then
descending
the
trench
on
one
side
with
scaling
-
ladders
,
and
ascending
it
on
the
other
again
by
the
same
means
;
and
knocking
down
barricades
of
baskets
,
and
behaving
in
the
most
gallant
manner
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Then
there
was
such
a
ramming
down
of
the
contents
of
enormous
guns
on
the
battery
,
with
instruments
like
magnified
mops
;
such
a
preparation
before
they
were
let
off
,
and
such
an
awful
noise
when
they
did
go
,
that
the
air
resounded
with
the
screams
of
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
Misses
Wardle
were
so
frightened
,
that
Mr
Trundle
was
actually
obliged
to
hold
one
of
them
up
in
the
carriage
,
while
Mr
Snodgrass
supported
the
other
;
and
Mr
Wardle
's
sister
suffered
under
such
a
dreadful
state
of
nervous
alarm
,
that
Mr
Tupman
found
it
indispensably
necessary
to
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
,
to
keep
her
up
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
was
excited
,
except
the
fat
boy
,
and
he
slept
as
soundly
as
if
the
roaring
of
cannon
were
his
ordinary
lullaby
.
   
<EOS>
"
Joe
,
Joe
!
"
said
the
stout
gentleman
,
when
the
citadel
was
taken
,
and
the
besiegers
and
besieged
sat
down
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
"
Damn
that
boy
,
he
's
gone
to
sleep
again
.
 
<EOS>
Be
good
enough
to
pinch
him
,
sir
---
in
the
leg
,
if
you
please
;
nothing
else
wakes
him
---
thank
you
.
<EOS>
Undo
the
hamper
,
Joe
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
,
who
had
been
effectually
roused
by
the
compression
of
a
portion
of
his
leg
between
the
finger
and
thumb
of
Mr
Winkle
,
rolled
off
the
box
once
again
,
and
proceeded
to
unpack
the
hamper
with
more
expedition
than
could
have
been
expected
from
his
previous
inactivity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
we
must
sit
close
,
"
said
the
stout
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
great
many
jokes
about
squeezing
the
ladies
"
sleeves
,
and
a
vast
quantity
of
blushing
at
sundry
jocose
proposals
,
that
the
ladies
should
sit
in
the
gentlemen
's
laps
,
the
whole
party
were
stowed
down
in
the
barouche
;
and
the
stout
gentleman
proceeded
to
hand
the
things
from
the
fat
boy
(
who
had
mounted
up
behind
for
the
purpose
)
into
the
carriage
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Joe
,
knives
and
forks
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
knives
and
forks
were
handed
in
,
and
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
inside
,
and
Mr
Winkle
on
the
box
,
were
each
furnished
with
those
useful
instruments
.

Plates

<EOS>
(
Sundry
taps
on
the
head
with
a
stick
,
and
the
fat
boy
,
with
some
difficulty
,
roused
from
his
lethargy
.
)
<EOS>
"
Come
,
hand
in
the
eatables
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
the
sound
of
the
last
word
which
roused
the
unctuous
boy
.
 
<EOS>
He
jumped
up
,
and
the
leaden
eyes
which
twinkled
behind
his
mountainous
cheeks
leered
horribly
upon
the
food
as
he
unpacked
it
from
the
basket
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
make
haste
,
"
said
Mr
Wardle
;
for
the
fat
boy
was
hanging
fondly
over
a
capon
,
which
he
seemed
wholly
unable
to
part
with
.
 
<EOS>
The
boy
sighed
deeply
,
and
,
bestowing
an
ardent
gaze
upon
its
plumpness
,
unwillingly
consigned
it
to
his
master
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
---
look
sharp

<EOS>
Now
the

the

Take

take
the

out

"
 
<EOS>
Such
were
the
hurried
orders
which
issued
from
the
lips
of
Mr
Wardle
,
as
he
handed
in
the
different
articles
described
,
and
placed
dishes
in
everybody
's
hands
,
and
on
everybody
's
knees
,
in
endless
number
.
<EOS>
"
Now
ai

"
<EOS>
inquired
that
jolly
personage
,
when
the
work
of
destruction
had
commenced
.
   
<EOS>
"
Capital

said
Mr

who
was
carving

Mr

emptied
his

placed

by

Mr

<EOS>
"
With
great
pleasure

replied
Mr
Winkle
to
Mr
Trundle
,
and
then
the
two
gentlemen
took
wine
,
after
which
they
took
a
glass
of
wine
round
,
ladies
and
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
dear
Emily

flirting

whispered
the
spinster
aunt
,
with
true
spinster
-
aunt

like
envy

to
her
brother
,
Mr
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
do

said
the
jolly
old
gentleman
;
"
all
very
natural
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
---
<EOS>
nothing
unusual
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
some
wine
,
Sir

"
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
had
been
deeply
investigating
the
interior
of
the
pigeon
-
pie
,
readily
assented
.
   
<EOS>
"
Emily

my

said
the
spinster
aunt

with
a
patronising
air

loud

"
Aunt

the
little
old

have
it
all
to
themselves

I
think
,
"
whispered
Miss
Isabella
Wardle
to
her
sister
Emily
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
laughed
very
heartily
,
and
the
old
one
tried
to
look
amiable
,
but
could
n't
manage
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Young
girls
have
such
spirits
,
"
said
Miss
Wardle
to
Mr
Tupman
,
with
an
air
of
gentle
commiseration
,
as
if
animal
spirits
were
contraband
,
and
their
possession
without
a
permit
a
high
crime
and
misdemeanour
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
they
have
,
"
replied
Mr
Tupman
,
not
exactly
making
the
sort
of
reply
that
was
expected
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
delightful
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
"
said
Miss
Wardle
,
rather
dubiously
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
permit
me
?
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
in
his
blandest
manner
,
touching
the
enchanting
Rachael
's
wrist
with
one
hand
,
and
gently
elevating
the
bottle
with
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
permit
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir

"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
looked
most
impressive
;
and
Rachael
expressed
her
fear
that
more
guns
were
going
off
,
in
which
case
,
of
course
,
she
should
have
required
support
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
my
dear
nieces
pretty
?
"
whispered
their
affectionate
aunt
to
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
,
if
their
aunt
was
n't
here

"
replied
the
ready
Pickwickian
,
with
a
passionate
glance
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
naughty
man
---
<EOS>
but
really
,
if
their
complexions
were
a
little
better

do
n't
you
think
they
would
be
nice

looking
girls

by
candlelight

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes

I
think
they
would

said
Mr
Tupman

with
an
air
of
indifference

<EOS>
"
Oh

quiz

<EOS>
I
know
what
you
were
going
to
say

<EOS>
"
What
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Tupman
,
who
had
not
precisely
made
up
his
mind
to
say
anything
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
were
going
to
say
that
Isabel
stoops

I
know
you
were
---
you
men
are
such
observers

<EOS>
Well
,
so
she
does
;
it
ca
n't
be
denied
;
and
,
certainly
,
if
there
is
one
thing
more
than
another
that
makes
a
girl
look
ugly
it
is
stooping
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
tell
her
that
when
she
gets
a
little
older
she
'll
be
quite
frightful
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
you
are
a
quiz
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
had
no
objection
to
earning
the
reputation
at
so
cheap
a
rate
:
so
he
looked
very
knowing
,
and
smiled
mysteriously
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
sarcastic
smile
,
"
said
the
admiring
Rachael
;
<EOS>
"
I
declare
I
'm
quite
afraid
of
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Afraid
of
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
ca
n't
disguise
anything
from
me
---
I
know
what
that
smile
means
very
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
?
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
who
had
not
the
slightest
notion
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
mean
,
"
said
the
amiable
aunt
,
sinking
her
voice
still
lower
---
"
<EOS>
you
mean
,
that
you
do
n't
think
Isabella
's
stooping
is
as
bad
as
Emily
's
boldness
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
she
is
bold
!
<EOS>
You
can
not
think
how
wretched
it
makes
me
sometimes
<EOS>
---
I
'm
sure
I
cry
about
it
for
hours
together
---
<EOS>
my
dear
brother
is
SO
good
,
and
so
unsuspicious
,
that
he
never
sees
it
;
if
he
did
,
I
'm
quite
certain
it
would
break
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
think
it
was
only
manner
<EOS>
---
I
hope
it
may
be
---

(
Here
the
affectionate
relative
heaved
a
deep
sigh
,
and
shook
her
head
despondingly
)
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
aunt
's
talking
about
us
,
"
whispered
Miss
Emily
Wardle
to
her
sister
---
<EOS>
"
I
'm
quite
certain
of
it
<EOS>
---
she
looks
so
malicious

<EOS>
"
Is
she
?

<EOS>
replied
Isabella
.
<EOS>
---
"
Hem

aunt

dear

"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes

my
dear
love

'm
SO
afraid

catch
cold

have
a
silk
handkerchief
to
tie

your
dear
old
head

<EOS>
However
well
deserved
this
piece
of
retaliation
might
have
been
,
it
was
as
vindictive
a
one
as
could
well
have
been
resorted
to
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
guessing
in
what
form
of
reply
the
aunt
's
indignation
would
have
vented
itself
,
had
not
Mr
Wardle
unconsciously
changed
the
subject
,
by
calling
emphatically
for
Joe
.
   
<EOS>
"
Damn
that
boy

"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
"
he
's
gone

sleep
again

<EOS>
"
Very
extraordinary

said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
does

always
sleep
in
this
way

<EOS>
"
Sleep

said
the
old
gentleman
,
"
he
's
always
asleep

<EOS>
Goes
on
errands
fast
asleep

and
snores
as

<EOS>
"
How
very
odd

said
Mr
Pickwick

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah

<EOS>
odd
indeed

"
returned
the
old
gentleman
;
"
I
'm
proud
of

boy

would

any
account

Here

<EOS>
The
fat
boy
rose
,
opened
his
eyes
,
swallowed
the
huge
piece
of
pie
he
had
been
in
the
act
of
masticating
when
he
last
fell
asleep
,
and
slowly
obeyed
his
master
's
orders
---
gloating
languidly
over
the
remains
of
the
feast
,
as
he
removed
the
plates
,
and
deposited
them
in
the
hamper
.
 
<EOS>
The
fresh
bottle
was
produced
,
and
speedily
emptied
:
the
hamper
was
made
fast
in
its
old
place
---
the
fat
boy
once
more
mounted
the
box
---
the
spectacles
and
pocket
-
glass
were
again
adjusted
---
and
the
evolutions
of
the
military
recommenced
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
fizzing
and
banging
of
guns
,
and
starting
of
ladies
---
and
then
a
Mine
was
sprung
,
to
the
gratification
of
everybody
---
and
when
the
mine
had
gone
off
,
the
military
and
the
company
followed
its
example
,
and
went
off
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now

mind

said
the
old
gentleman
,
as
he
shook
hands
with
Mr
Pickwick
at
the
conclusion
of
a
conversation
which
had
been
carried
on
at
intervals

during
the
conclusion

said
the

The
horses
were
put
in

the
driver
mounted

the
fat
boy
clambered
up
by
his
side

farewells
were
exchanged

and
the
carriage
rattled
off

<EOS>
As
the
Pickwickians
turned
round
to
take
a
last
glimpse
of
it
,
the
setting
sun
cast
a
rich
glow
on
the
faces
of
their
entertainers
,
and
fell
upon
the
form
of
the
fat
boy

<EOS>
His
head
was
sunk
upon
his
bosom
;
and
he
slumbered
again

A

how
Mr
Pickwick
undertook

drive

Mr

to

Bright

sky
,
balmy
the
air
,
and
beautiful
the
appearance
of
every
object
around
,
as
Mr
Pickwick
leaned
over
the
balustrades
of
Rochester
Bridge
,
contemplating
nature
,
and
waiting
for
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
The
scene
was
indeed
one
which
might
well
have
charmed
a
far
less
reflective
mind
,
than
that
to
which
it
was
presented
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
left
of
the
spectator
lay
the
ruined
wall
,
broken
in
many
places
,
and
in
some
,
overhanging
the
narrow
beach
below
in
rude
and
heavy
masses
.
 
<EOS>
Huge
knots
of
seaweed
hung
upon
the
jagged
and
pointed
stones
,
trembling
in
every
breath
of
wind
;
and
the
green
ivy
clung
mournfully
round
the
dark
and
ruined
battlements
.
<EOS>
Behind
it
rose
the
ancient
castle
,
its
towers
roofless
,
and
its
massive
walls
crumbling
away
,
but
telling
us
proudly
of
its
old
might
and
strength
,
as
when
,
seven
hundred
years
ago
,
it
rang
with
the
clash
of
arms
,
or
resounded
with
the
noise
of
feasting
and
revelry
.
 
<EOS>
On
either
side
,
the
banks
of
the
Medway
,
covered
with
cornfields
and
pastures
,
with
here
and
there
a
windmill
,
or
a
distant
church
,
stretched
away
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
,
presenting
a
rich
and
varied
landscape
,
rendered
more
beautiful
by
the
changing
shadows
which
passed
swiftly
across
it
as
the
thin
and
half
-
formed
clouds
skimmed
away
in
the
light
of
the
morning
sun
.
 
<EOS>
The
river
,
reflecting
the
clear
blue
of
the
sky
,
glistened
and
sparkled
as
it
flowed
noiselessly
on
;
and
the
oars
of
the
fishermen
dipped
into
the
water
with
a
clear
and
liquid
sound
,
as
their
heavy
but
picturesque
boats
glided
slowly
down
the
stream
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
roused
from
the
agreeable
reverie
into
which
he
had
been
led
by
the
objects
before
him
,
by
a
deep
sigh
,
and
a
touch
on
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
round
:
and
the
dismal
man
was
at
his
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
Contemplating
the
scene
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
dismal
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
congratulating
yourself
on
being
up
so
soon
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
nodded
assent
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
people
need
to
rise
early
,
to
see
the
sun
in
all
his
splendour
,
for
his
brightness
seldom
lasts
the
day
through
.
 
<EOS>
The
morning
of
day
and
the
morning
of
life
are
but
too
much
alike
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
speak
truly
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
common
the
saying
,
"
continued
the
dismal
man
,
"
"
<EOS>
The
morning
's
too
fine
to
last
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
How
well
might
it
be
applied
to
our
everyday
existence
.
 
<EOS>
God
!
<EOS>
what
would
I
forfeit
to
have
the
days
of
my
childhood
restored
,
or
to
be
able
to
forget
them
for
ever
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
much
trouble
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
compassionately
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
said
the
dismal
man
hurriedly
;
"
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
those
who
see
me
now
would
believe
possible
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
paused
for
an
instant
,
and
then
said
abruptly
---
   
"
<EOS>
Did
it
ever
strike
you
,
on
such
a
morning
as
this
,
that
drowning
would
be
happiness
and
peace
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
me
,
no
!
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
edging
a
little
from
the
balustrade
,
as
the
possibility
of
the
dismal
man
's
tipping
him
over
,
by
way
of
experiment
,
occurred
to
him
rather
forcibly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
thought
so
,
often
,
"
said
the
dismal
man
,
without
noticing
the
action
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
calm
,
cool
water
seems
to
me
to
murmur
an
invitation
to
repose
and
rest
.
 
<EOS>
A
bound
,
a
splash
,
a
brief
struggle
;
there
is
an
eddy
for
an
instant
,
it
gradually
subsides
into
a
gentle
ripple
;
the
waters
have
closed
above
your
head
,
and
the
world
has
closed
upon
your
miseries
and
misfortunes
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
sunken
eye
of
the
dismal
man
flashed
brightly
as
he
spoke
,
but
the
momentary
excitement
quickly
subsided
;
and
he
turned
calmly
away
,
as
he
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
There
---
enough
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
see
you
on
another
subject
.
<EOS>
You
invited
me
to
read
that
paper
,
the
night
before
last
,
and
listened
attentively
while
I
did
so
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
and
I
certainly
thought
---
"
   
"
I
asked
for
no
opinion
,
"
said
the
dismal
man
,
interrupting
him
,
"
and
I
want
none
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
travelling
for
amusement
and
instruction
.
<EOS>
Suppose
I
forward
you
a
curious
manuscript
---
observe
,
not
curious
because
wild
or
improbable
,
but
curious
as
a
leaf
from
the
romance
of
real
life
---
would
you
communicate
it
to
the
club
,
of
which
you
have
spoken
so
frequently
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
if
you
wished
it
;
and
it
would
be
entered
on
their
transactions
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
it
,
"
replied
the
dismal
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
address
;
"
and
,
Mr
Pickwick
having
communicated
their
probable
route
<EOS>
,
the
dismal
man
carefully
noted
it
down
in
a
greasy
pocket
-
book
,
and
,
resisting
Mr
Pickwick
's
pressing
invitation
to
breakfast
,
left
that
gentleman
at
his
inn
,
and
walked
slowly
away
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
found
that
his
three
companions
had
risen
,
and
were
waiting
his
arrival
to
commence
breakfast
,
which
was
ready
laid
in
tempting
display
.
 
<EOS>
They
sat
down
to
the
meal
;
and
broiled
ham
,
eggs
,
tea
,
coffee
and
sundries
,
began
to
disappear
with
a
rapidity
which
at
once
bore
testimony
to
the
excellence
of
the
fare
,
and
the
appetites
of
its
consumers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
about
Manor
Farm

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
shall
we
go
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
had
better
consult
the
waiter
,
perhaps
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
;
and
the
waiter
was
summoned
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
"

"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
to
be
done
?
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
one
of
the
gentlemen
would
like
to
ride
,
sir
?
"
suggested
the
waiter
,
looking
towards
Mr
Winkle
;
"
<EOS>
very
good
saddle
-
horses
,
sir
---
any
of
Mr
Wardle
's

"
   
<EOS>
"
The
very
thing
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Winkle
,
will
you
go
on
horseback
?
"
   
<EOS>
Now
Mr
Winkle
did
entertain
considerable
misgivings
in
the
very
lowest
recesses
of
his
own
heart
,
relative
to
his
equestrian
skill
;
but
,
as
he
would
not
have
them
even
suspected
,
on
any
account
,
he
at
once
replied
with
great
hardihood
,
"
Certainly
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
enjoy
it
of
all
things
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
had
rushed
upon
his
fate
;
there
was
no
resource
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
them
be
at
the
door
by
eleven
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
waiter
.
   
<EOS>
The
waiter
retired
;
the
breakfast
concluded
;
and
the
travellers
ascended
to
their
respective
bedrooms
,
to
prepare
a
change
of
clothing
,
to
take
with
them
on
their
approaching
expedition
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
had
made
his
preliminary
arrangements
,
and
was
looking
over
the
coffee
-
room
blinds
at
the
passengers
in
the
street
,
when
the
waiter
entered
,
and
announced
that
the
chaise
was
ready
---
an
announcement
which
the
vehicle
itself
confirmed
,
by
forthwith
appearing
before
the
coffee
-
room
blinds
aforesaid
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
curious
little
green
box
on
four
wheels
,
with
a
low
place
like
a
wine
-
bin
for
two
behind
,
and
an
elevated
perch
for
one
in
front
,
drawn
by
an
immense
brown
horse
,
displaying
great
symmetry
of
bone
.
 
<EOS>
An
hostler
stood
near
,
holding
by
the
bridle
another
immense
horse
---
apparently
a
near
relative
of
the
animal
in
the
chaise
---
ready
saddled
for
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
soul
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
they
stood
upon
the
pavement
while
the
coats
were
being
put
in
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
soul
!
<EOS>
who
's
to
drive
?
<EOS>
I
never
thought
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
,
of
course
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
the
slightest
fear
,
Sir
,
"
interposed
the
hostler
.
 
<EOS>
"
Warrant
him
quiet
,
Sir
;
a
hinfant
in
arms
might
drive
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
do
n't
shy
,
does
he
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shy
,
sir?-he
would
n't
shy
if
he
was
to
meet
a
vagin
-
load
of
monkeys
with
their
tails
burned
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
last
recommendation
was
indisputable
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
and
Mr
Snodgrass
got
into
the
bin
;
Mr
Pickwick
ascended
to
his
perch
,
and
deposited
his
feet
on
a
floor
-
clothed
shelf
,
erected
beneath
it
for
that
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now

shiny
Villiam

"
said
the
hostler
to
the
deputy
hostler
,
"
give
the
gen'lm'n
the
ribbons
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shiny
Villiam
"
---
so
called
,
probably
,
from
his
sleek
hair
and
oily
countenance
---
placed
the
reins
in
Mr
Pickwick
's
left
hand
;
and
the
upper
hostler
thrust
a
whip
into
his
right
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wo
-
o
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
the
tall
quadruped
evinced
a
decided
inclination
to
back
into
the
coffee
-
room
window
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wo
-
o
!
"
echoed
Mr
Tupman
and
Mr
Snodgrass
,
from
the
bin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
his
playfulness
,
gen'lm'n
<EOS>

"
said
the
head
hostler
encouragingly
;
"
jist
kitch
hold
on
him
,
Villiam
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
deputy
restrained
the
animal
's
impetuosity
,
and
the
principal
ran
to
assist
Mr
Winkle
in
mounting
.
   
<EOS>
"
T'other
side
,
sir
,
if
you
please

"
   
<EOS>
"
Blowed

whispered
a
grinning
post
-
boy
to
the
inexpressibly
gratified
waiter
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
,
thus
instructed
,
climbed
into
his
saddle
,
with
about
as
much
difficulty
as
he
would
have
experienced
in
getting
up
the
side
of
a
first
-
rate
man
-
of
-
war
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
All
right

"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
an
inward
presentiment
that
it
was
all
wrong
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
faintly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
'em
go
,
"
cried
the
hostler
.
<EOS>
---
"
Hold
him
in
,
sir
;
"
and
away
went
the
chaise
,
and
the
saddle
-
horse
,
with
Mr
Pickwick
on
the
box
of
the
one
,
and
Mr
Winkle
on
the
back
of
the
other
,
to
the
delight
and
gratification
of
the
whole
inn
-
yard
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
makes
him
go
sideways
?
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
in
the
bin
,
to
Mr
Winkle
in
the
saddle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
imagine
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
His
horse
was
drifting
up
the
street
in
the
most
mysterious
manner
---
side
first
,
with
his
head
towards
one
side
of
the
way
,
and
his
tail
towards
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
had
no
leisure
to
observe
either
this
or
any
other
particular
,
the
whole
of
his
faculties
being
concentrated
in
the
management
of
the
animal
attached
to
the
chaise
,
who
displayed
various
peculiarities
,
highly
interesting
to
a
bystander
,
but
by
no
means
equally
amusing
to
any
one
seated
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
constantly
jerking
his
head
up
,
in
a
very
unpleasant
and
uncomfortable
manner
,
and
tugging
at
the
reins
to
an
extent
which
rendered
it
a
matter
of
great
difficulty
for
Mr
Pickwick
to
hold
them
,
he
had
a
singular
propensity
for
darting
suddenly
every
now
and
then
to
the
side
of
the
road
,
then
stopping
short
,
and
then
rushing
forward
for
some
minutes
,
at
a
speed
which
it
was
wholly
impossible
to
control
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
CAN
he
mean
by
this
?
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
,
when
the
horse
had
executed
this
manoeuvre
for
the
twentieth
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
replied
Mr
Tupman
;
"
it
looks
very
like
shying
,
do
n't
it
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
was
about
to
reply
,
when
he
was
interrupted
by
a
shout
from
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Woo
!
"
said
that
gentleman
;
"
I
have
dropped
my
whip
.
"
<EOS>
"
Winkle
,
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
,
as
the
equestrian
came
trotting
up
on
the
tall
horse
,
with
his
hat
over
his
ears
,
and
shaking
all
over
,
as
if
he
would
shake
to
pieces
,
with
the
violence
of
the
exercise
,
"
pick
up
the
whip
<EOS>
,
there
's
a
good
fellow
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
pulled
at
the
bridle
of
the
tall
horse
till
he
was
black
in
the
face
;
and
having
at
length
succeeded
in
stopping
him
,
dismounted
,
handed
the
whip
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
grasping
the
reins
,
prepared
to
remount
.
   
<EOS>
Now
whether
the
tall
horse
,
in
the
natural
playfulness
of
his
disposition
,
was
desirous
of
having
a
little
innocent
recreation
with
Mr
Winkle
,
or
whether
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
could
perform
the
journey
as
much
to
his
own
satisfaction
without
a
rider
as
with
one
,
are
points
upon
which
,
of
course
,
we
can
arrive
at
no
definite
and
distinct
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
By
whatever
motives
the
animal
was
actuated
,
certain
it
is
that
Mr
Winkle
had
no
sooner
touched
the
reins
,
than
he
slipped
them
over
his
head
,
and
darted
backwards
to
their
full
length
.
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
fellow
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
soothingly
---
"
poor
fellow
---
good
old
horse
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
"
poor
fellow
"
was
proof
against
flattery
;
the
more
Mr
Winkle
tried
to
get
nearer
him
,
the
more
he
sidled
away
;
and
,
notwithstanding
all
kinds
of
coaxing
and
wheedling
,
there
were
Mr
Winkle
and
the
horse
going
round
and
round
each
other
for
ten
minutes
,
at
the
end
of
which
time
each
was
at
precisely
the
same
distance
from
the
other
as
when
they
first
commenced
---
an
unsatisfactory
sort
of
thing
under
any
circumstances
,
but
particularly
so
in
a
lonely
road
,
where
no
assistance
can
be
procured
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
do
?
"
shouted
Mr
Winkle
,
after
the
dodging
had
been
prolonged
for
a
considerable
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
get
on
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
lead
him
till
we
come
to
a
turnpike
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
from
the
chaise
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
he
wo
n't
come
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
come
and
hold
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
the
very
personation
of
kindness
and
humanity
:
he
threw
the
reins
on
the
horse
's
back
,
and
having
descended
from
his
seat
,
carefully
drew
the
chaise
into
the
hedge
,
lest
anything
should
come
along
the
road
,
and
stepped
back
to
the
assistance
of
his
distressed
companion
,
leaving
Mr
Tupman
and
Mr
Snodgrass
in
the
vehicle
.
   
<EOS>
The
horse
no
sooner
beheld
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
advancing
towards
him
with
the
chaise
whip
in
his
hand
,
than
he
exchanged
the
rotary
motion
in
which
he
had
previously
indulged
,
for
a
retrograde
movement
of
<EOS>
so
very
determined
a
character
,
that
it
at
once
drew
Mr
Winkle
,
who
was
still
at
the
end
of
the
bridle
,
at
a
rather
quicker
rate
than
fast
walking
,
in
the
direction
from
which
they
had
just
come
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
ran
to
his
assistance
,
but
the
faster
Mr
Pickwick
ran
forward
,
the
faster
the
horse
ran
backward
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
scraping
of
feet
,
and
kicking
up
of
the
dust
;
and
at
last
Mr
Winkle
,
his
arms
being
nearly
pulled
out
of
their
sockets
,
fairly
let
go
his
hold
.
 
<EOS>
The
horse
paused
,
stared
,
shook
his
head
,
turned
round
,
and
quietly
trotted
home
to
Rochester
,
leaving
Mr
Winkle
and
Mr
Pickwick
gazing
on
each
other
with
countenances
of
blank
dismay
.
 
<EOS>
A
rattling
noise
at
a
little
distance
attracted
their
attention
.
 
<EOS>
They
looked
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
soul
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
agonised
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
there
's
the
other
horse
running
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
but
too
true
.
 
<EOS>
The
animal
was
startled
by
the
noise
,
and
the
reins
were
on
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
The
results
may
be
guessed
.
 
<EOS>
He
tore
off
with
the
four
-
wheeled
chaise
behind
him
,
and
Mr
Tupman
and
Mr
Snodgrass
in
the
four
-
wheeled
chaise
.
 
<EOS>
The
heat
was
a
short
one
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
threw
himself
into
the
hedge
,
Mr
Snodgrass
followed
his
example
,
the
horse
dashed
the
four
---
wheeled
chaise
against
a
wooden
bridge
,
separated
the
wheels
from
the
body
,
and
the
bin
from
the
perch
;
and
finally
stood
stock
still
to
gaze
upon
the
ruin
he
had
made
.
   
<EOS>
The
first
care
of
the
two
unspilt
friends
was
to
extricate
their
unfortunate
companions
from
their
bed
of
quickset
---
a
process
which
gave
them
the
unspeakable
satisfaction
of
discovering
that
they
had
sustained
no
injury
,
beyond
sundry
rents
in
their
garments
,
and
various
lacerations
from
the
brambles
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
thing
to
be
done
was
to
unharness
the
horse
.
 
<EOS>
This
complicated
process
having
been
effected
,
the
party
walked
slowly
forward
,
leading
the
horse
among
them
,
and
abandoning
the
chaise
to
its
fate
.
   
<EOS>
An
hour
's
walk
brought
the
travellers
to
a
little
road
-
side
public
-
house
,
with
two
elm
-
trees
,
a
horse
trough
,
and
a
signpost
,
in
front
;
one
or
two
deformed
hay
-
ricks
behind
,
a
kitchen
garden
at
the
side
,
and
rotten
sheds
and
mouldering
outhouses
jumbled
in
strange
confusion
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
red
-
headed
man
was
working
in
the
garden
;
and
to
him
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
called
lustily
,
"
Hollo
there
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
red
-
headed
man
raised
his
body
,
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
,
and
stared
,
long
and
coolly
,
at
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
companions
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
there
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
red
-
headed
man
's
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
far
is
it
to
Dingley
Dell
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Better
er
seven
mile
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
a
good
road
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
tain't
.
"
 
<EOS>
Having
uttered
this
brief
reply
,
and
apparently
satisfied
himself
with
another
scrutiny
,
the
red
-
headed
man
resumed
his
work
.
<EOS>
"
We
want
to
put
this
horse
up
here
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
I
suppose
we
can
,
ca
n't
we
?
"
<EOS>
"
Want
to
put
that
ere
horse
up
,
do
ee
?
"
repeated
the
red
-
headed
man
,
leaning
on
his
spade
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
had
by
this
time
advanced
,
horse
in
hand
,
to
the
garden
rails
.
   
<EOS>
"
Missus
"
---
roared
the
man
with
the
red
head
,
emerging
from
the
garden
,
and
looking
very
hard
at
the
horse
---
"
missus
!
"
   
<EOS>
A
tall
,
bony
woman
---
straight
all
the
way
down
---
in
a
coarse
,
blue
pelisse
,
with
the
waist
an
inch
or
two
below
her
arm
-
pits
,
responded
to
the
call
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
we
put
this
horse
up
here
,
my
good
woman
?
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
advancing
,
and
speaking
in
his
most
seductive
tones
.
<EOS>
The
woman
looked
very
hard
at
the
whole
party
;
and
the
red
-
headed
man
whispered
something
in
her
ear
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
the
woman
,
after
a
little
consideration
,
"
I
'm
afeerd
on
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Afraid
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
what
's
the
woman
afraid
of
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
got
us
in
trouble
last
time
,
"
said
the
woman
,
turning
into
the
house
;
"
I
woan't
have
nothin'
to
say
to
'
un
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Most
extraordinary
thing
I
have
ever
met
with
in
my
life
,
"
said
the
astonished
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
---
really
believe
,
"
whispered
Mr
Winkle
,
as
his
friends
gathered
round
him
,
"
that
they
think
we
have
come
by
this
horse
in
some
dishonest
manner
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
,
in
a
storm
of
indignation
.
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
modestly
repeated
his
suggestion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
,
you
fellow
,
"
said
the
angry
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
do
you
think
we
stole
the
horse
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
ye
did
,
"
replied
the
red
-
headed
man
,
with
a
grin
which
agitated
his
countenance
from
one
auricular
organ
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
Saying
which
he
turned
into
the
house
and
banged
the
door
after
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
like
a
dream
,
"
ejaculated
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
a
hideous
dream
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
a
man
's
walking
about
all
day
with
a
dreadful
horse
that
he
ca
n't
get
rid
of
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
depressed
Pickwickians
turned
moodily
away
,
with
the
tall
quadruped
,
for
which
they
all
felt
the
most
unmitigated
disgust
,
following
slowly
at
their
heels
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
four
friends
and
their
four
-
footed
companion
turned
into
the
lane
leading
to
Manor
Farm
;
and
even
when
they
were
so
near
their
place
of
destination
,
<EOS>
the
pleasure
they
would
otherwise
have
experienced
was
materially
damped
as
they
reflected
on
the
singularity
of
their
appearance
,
and
the
absurdity
of
their
situation
.
 
<EOS>
Torn
clothes
,
lacerated
faces
,
dusty
shoes
,
exhausted
looks
,
and
,
above
all
,
the
horse
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
Mr
Pickwick
cursed
that
horse
:
he
had
eyed
the
noble
animal
from
time
to
time
with
looks
expressive
of
hatred
and
revenge
;
more
than
once
he
had
calculated
the
probable
amount
of
the
expense
he
would
incur
by
cutting
his
throat
;
and
now
the
temptation
to
destroy
him
,
or
to
cast
him
loose
upon
the
world
,
rushed
upon
his
mind
with
tenfold
force
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
roused
from
a
meditation
on
these
dire
imaginings
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
two
figures
at
a
turn
of
the
lane
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Mr
Wardle
,
and
his
faithful
attendant
,
the
fat
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
where
have
you
been
?
"
said
the
hospitable
old
gentleman
;
"
I
've
been
waiting
for
you
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
you
DO
look
tired
.
 
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
Scratches
!
<EOS>
Not
hurt
,
I
hope
---
eh
?
<EOS>
Well
,
I
AM
glad
to
hear
that
---
very
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
've
been
spilt
,
eh
?
<EOS>
Never
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Common
accident

parts

<EOS>
Joe

he
's
asleep
again

<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Joe
,
take
that
horse
from
the
gentlemen
,
and
lead
it
into
the
stable
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
sauntered
heavily
behind
them
with
the
animal
;
and
the
old
gentleman
,
condoling
with
his
guests
in
homely
phrase
on
so
much
of
the
day
's
adventures
as
they
thought
proper
to
communicate
,
led
the
way
to
the
kitchen
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
'll
have
you
put
to
rights
here
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
"
and
then
I
'll
introduce
you
to
the
people
in
the
parlour

<EOS>
Emma

<EOS>
Come

"
   
<EOS>
Three
or
four
buxom
girls
speedily
dispersed
in
search
of
the
different
articles
in
requisition
,
while
a
couple
of
large
-
headed
,
circular
-
visaged
males
rose
from
their
seats
in
the
chimney
-
corner
(
for
although
it
was
a
May
evening
their
attachment
to
the
wood
fire
appeared
as
cordial
as
if
it
were
Christmas
)
,
and
dived
into
some
obscure
recesses
,
from
which
they
speedily
produced
a
bottle
of
blacking
,
and
some
half
-
dozen
brushes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bustle
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
old
gentleman
again
,
but
the
admonition
was
quite
unnecessary
,
for
one
of
the
girls
poured
out
the
cherry
brandy
,
and
another
brought
in
the
towels
,
and
one
of
the
men
suddenly
seizing
Mr
Pickwick
by
the
leg
,
at
imminent
hazard
of
throwing
him
off
his
balance
,
brushed
away
at
his
boot
till
his
corns
were
red
-
hot
;
while
the
other
shampooed
Mr
Winkle
with
a
heavy
clothes
-
brush
,
indulging
,
during
the
operation
,
in
that
hissing
sound
which
hostlers
are
wo
nt
to
produce
when
engaged
in
rubbing
down
a
horse
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
,
having
concluded
his
ablutions
,
took
a
survey
of
the
room
,
while
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
sipping
his
cherry
brandy
with
heartfelt
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
He
describes
it
as
a
large
apartment
,
with
a
red
brick
floor
and
a
capacious
chimney
;
the
ceiling
garnished
with
hams
,
sides
of
bacon
,
and
ropes
of
onions
.
 
<EOS>
The
walls
were
decorated
with
several
hunting
-
whips
,
two
or
three
bridles
,
a
saddle
,
and
an
old
rusty
blunderbuss
,
with
an
inscription
below
it
,
intimating
that
it
was
"
Loaded
"
---
as
it
had
been
,
on
the
same
authority
,
for
half
a
century
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
An
old
eight
-
day
clock
,
of
solemn
and
sedate
demeanour
,
ticked
gravely
in
one
corner
;
and
a
silver
watch
,
of
equal
antiquity
,
dangled
from
one
of
the
many
hooks
which
ornamented
the
dresser
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ready
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
old
gentleman
inquiringly
,
when
his
guests
had
been
washed
,
mended
,
brushed
,
and
brandied
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite

"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
along
,
then
;
"
and
the
party
having
traversed
several
dark
passages
,
and
being
joined
by
Mr
Tupman
,
who
had
lingered
behind
to
snatch
a
kiss
from
Emma
,
for
which
he
had
been
duly
rewarded
with
sundry
pushings
and
scratchings
,
arrived
at
the
parlour
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Welcome

said
their
hospitable
host

throwing

open

stepping
forward

announce
them

"

the

Several
guests
who
were
assembled
in
the
old
parlour
rose
to
greet
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
friends
upon
their
entrance
;
and
during
the
performance
of
the
ceremony
of
introduction
,
with
all
due
formalities
,
Mr
Pickwick
had
leisure
to
observe
the
appearance
,
and
speculate
upon
the
characters
and
pursuits
,
of
the
persons
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
---
a
habit
in
which
he
,
in
common

A
very
old
lady
,
in
a
lofty

no

Mr
Wardle

The

the

young

and
Mr
Wardle
,
each
vying
with
the
other
in
paying
zealous
and
unremitting
attentions
to
the
old
lady

crowded
round
her
easy

chair

one
holding
her
ear

trumpet
,
another
an
orange

and
a
third
a

while
a
fourth
was
busily
engaged
in
patting
and
punching
the
pillows
which
were
arranged
for
her
support

<EOS>
On
the
opposite

sat
a
bald

headed
old
gentleman
,
with
a
good
-
humoured
,
benevolent
face
---
the
clergyman
of
Dingley
Dell

and
next
him
sat
his
wife
,
a
stout

blooming
old
lady

who
looked
as
if
she
were
well
skilled

not

<EOS>
A
little
hard
-
headed
,
Ripstone
pippin
-
faced
man
,
was
conversing
with
a
fat
old
gentleman
in
one
corner
;
and
two
or
three
more
old
gentlemen
,
and
two
or
three
more
old
ladies
,
sat
bolt
upright
and
motionless
on
their
chairs
,
staring
very
hard
at
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
fellow
-
voyagers

<EOS>
"
Mr
Pickwick

said
Mr
Wardle
,
at
the
very
top
of
his
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah

<EOS>
"
said
the
old
lady
,
shaking
her
head
;
"
I

<EOS>
"
Mr

screamed
both
the

together

"
Ah

exclaimed
the

Well

<EOS>
"
I

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
grasping
the
old
lady
's
hand
,
and
speaking
so
loud
that
the
exertion
imparted
a
crimson
hue
to
his
benevolent
countenance

"
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
ma'am

that
nothing
delights
me
more
than
to

looking
so
young

well

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah

said
the
old
lady
,
after
a
short
pause
:
"
it

I

<EOS>
"
Grandma

said
Miss

Wardle

in
a
low
tone
;

but
she
'll
talk

presently

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
nodded
his
readiness
to
humour
the
infirmities
of
age
,
and
entered
into
a
general
conversation
with
the
other
members
of
the
circle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Delightful
situation
this
,
"
said
Mr

<EOS>
"
Delightful

echoed
Messrs.

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
think
it
is

said
Mr

<EOS>
"
There

I

<EOS>
The
hard

man
looked
triumphantly
round
,
as
if
he
had
been
very
much
contradicted
by
somebody
,
but
had
got
the
better
of
him
at

"
There

again
,
after
a
pause

<EOS>
"

Cept

observed
the
fat

solemnly
.
"

ejaculated
the

,
with
profound

<EOS>
"

repeated
the

"

And

"
said
a
third
fat
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Everybody
knows
that
,
"
said
the
corpulent
host
.
   
<EOS>
The
hard
-
headed
man
looked
dubiously
round
,
but
finding
himself
in
a
minority
,
assumed
a
compassionate
air
and
said
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
What
are
they
talking
about
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
old
lady
of
one
of
her
granddaughters
,
in
a
very
audible
voice
;
for
,
like
many
deaf
people
,
she
never
seemed
to
calculate
on
the
possibility
of
other
persons
hearing
what
she
said
herself
.
   
<EOS>
"
About

grandma

"
   
<EOS>
"
What

<EOS>

Nothing

"
   
<EOS>
"
No

no

<EOS>
Mr
Miller
was
saying
our
land
was
better
than
Mullins
's
Meadows
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
should
he
know
anything
about
it
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
old
lady
indignantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miller
's
a
conceited
coxcomb
,
and
<EOS>
you
may
tell
him
I
said
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
Saying
which
,
the
old
lady
,
quite
unconscious
that
she
had
spoken
above
a
whisper
,
drew
herself
up
,
and
looked
carving
-
knives
at
the
hard
-
headed
delinquent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
"
said
the
bustling
host
,
with
a
natural
anxiety
to
change
the
conversation
,
"
what
say
you
to
a
rubber
,
Mr
Pickwick
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
it
of
all
things
,
"
replied
that
gentleman
;
"
but
pray
do
n't
make
up
one
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
assure
you
,
mother
's
very
fond
of
a
rubber
,
"
said
Mr
Wardle
;
"
ai
n't
you
,
mother
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
lady
,
who
was
much
less
deaf
on
this
subject
than
on
any
other
,
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
Joe
,
Joe
!
"
said
the
gentleman
;
"
Joe
---
damn
that
---
oh
,
here
he
is
;
put
out
the
card
---
tables
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
lethargic
youth
contrived
without
any
additional
rousing
to
set
out
two
card
-
tables
;
the
one
for
Pope
Joan
,
and
the
other
for
whist
.
 
<EOS>
The
whist
-
players
were
Mr
Pickwick
and
the
old
lady
,
Mr
Miller
and
the
fat
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
The
round
game
comprised
the
rest
of
the
company
.
   
<EOS>
The
rubber
was
conducted
with
all
that
gravity
of
deportment
and
sedateness
of
demeanour
which
befit
the
pursuit
entitled
"
whist
"
---
a
solemn
observance
,
to
which
,
as
it
appears
to
us
,
<EOS>
the
title
of
"
game
"
has
been
very
irreverently
and
ignominiously
applied
.
 
<EOS>
The
round
-
game
table
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
so
boisterously
merry
as
materially
to
interrupt
the
contemplations
of
Mr
Miller
,
who
,
not
being
quite
so
much
absorbed
as
he
ought
to
have
been
,
contrived
to
commit
various
high
crimes
and
misdemeanours
,
which
excited
the
wrath
of
the
fat
gentleman
to
a
very
great
extent
,
and
called
forth
the
good
-
humour
of
the
old
lady
in
a
proportionate
degree
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
the
criminal
Miller
triumphantly
,
as
he
took
up
the
odd
trick
at
the
conclusion
of
a
hand
;
"
that
could
not
have
been
played
better
,
I
flatter
myself
;
impossible
to
have
made
another
trick
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miller
ought
to
have
trumped
the
diamond
,
ought
n't
he
,
Sir
?
"
said
the
old
lady
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
nodded
assent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ought
I
,
though
?
"
said
the
unfortunate
,
with
a
doubtful
appeal
to
his
partner
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
ought
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
fat
gentleman
,
in
an
awful
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
sorry
,
"
said
the
crestfallen
Miller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Much
use
that
,
"
growled
the
fat
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Two
by
honours
---
makes
us
eight
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Another
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
one
?
"
inquired
the
old
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Double
,
single
,
and
the
rub
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
was
such
luck
,
"
said
Mr
Miller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
was
such
cards
,
"
said
the
fat
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
A
solemn
silence
;
Mr
Pickwick
humorous
,
the
old
lady
serious
,
the
fat
gentleman
captious
,
and
Mr
Miller
timorous
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Another
double
,
"
said
the
old
lady
,
triumphantly
making
a
memorandum
of
the
circumstance
,
by
placing
one
sixpence
and
a
battered
halfpenny
under
the
candlestick
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
double
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
aware
of
the
fact
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
fat
gentleman
sharply
.
   
<EOS>
Another
game
,
with
a
similar
result
,
was
followed
by
a
revoke
from
the
unlucky
Miller
;
on
which
the
fat
gentleman
burst
into
a
state
of
high
personal
excitement
which
lasted
until
the
conclusion
of
the
game
,
when
he
retired
into
a
corner
,
and
remained
perfectly
mute
for
one
hour
and
twenty
-
seven
minutes
;
at
the
end
of
which
time
he
emerged
from
his
retirement
,
and
offered
Mr
Pickwick
a
pinch
of
snuff
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
made
up
his
mind
to
a
Christian
forgiveness
of
injuries
sustained
.
<EOS>
The
old
lady
's
hearing
decidedly
improved
and
the
unlucky
Miller
felt
as
much
out
of
his
element
as
a
dolphin
in
a
sentry
-
box
.
   
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
round
game
proceeded
right
merrily
.
 
<EOS>
Isabella
Wardle
and
Mr
Trundle
"
went
partners
,
"
and
Emily
Wardle
and
Mr
Snodgrass
did
the
same
;
and
even
Mr
Tupman
and
the
spinster
aunt
established
a
joint
-
stock
company
of
fish
and
flattery
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Mr
Wardle
was
in
the
very
height
of
his
jollity
;
and
he
was
so
funny
in
his
management
of
the
board
,
and
the
old
ladies
were
so
sharp
after
their
winnings
,
that
the
whole
table
was
in
a
perpetual
roar
of
merriment
and
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
one
old
lady
who
always
had
about
half
a
dozen
cards
to
pay
for
,
at
which
everybody
laughed
,
<EOS>
regularly
every
round
;
and
when
the
old
lady
looked
cross
at
having
to
pay
,
they
laughed
louder
than
ever
;
on
which
the
old
lady
's
face
gradually
brightened
up
,
till
at
last
she
laughed
louder
than
any
of
them
,
Then
,
when
the
spinster
aunt
got
"
matrimony
,
"
the
young
ladies
laughed
afresh
,
and
the
Spinster
aunt
seemed
disposed
to
be
pettish
;
till
,
feeling
Mr
Tupman
squeezing
her
hand
under
the
table
,
she
brightened
up
too
,
and
looked
rather
knowing
,
as
if
matrimony
in
reality
were
not
quite
so
far
off
as
some
people
thought
for
;
whereupon
everybody
laughed
again
,
and
especially
old
Mr
Wardle
,
who
enjoyed
a
joke
as
much
as
the
youngest
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Mr
Snodgrass
,
he
did
nothing
but
whisper
poetical
sentiments
into
his
partner
's
ear
,
which
made
one
old
gentleman
facetiously
sly
,
about
partnerships
at
cards
and
partnerships
for
life
,
and
caused
the
aforesaid
old
gentleman
to
make
some
remarks
thereupon
,
accompanied
with
divers
winks
and
chuckles
,
which
made
the
company
very
merry
and
the
old
gentleman
's
wife
especially
so
.
<EOS>
And
Mr
Winkle
came
out
with
jokes
which
are
very
well
known
in
town
,
but
are
not
all
known
in
the
country
;
and
as
everybody
laughed
at
them
very
heartily
,
and
said
they
were
very
capital
,
Mr
Winkle
was
in
a
state
of
great
honour
and
glory
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
benevolent
clergyman
looked
pleasantly
on
;
for
the
happy
faces
which
surrounded
the
table
made
the
good
old
man
feel
happy
too
;
and
though
the
merriment
was
rather
boisterous
,
still
it
came
from
the
heart
and
not
from
the
lips
;
and
this
is
the
right
sort
of
merriment
,
after
all
.
   
<EOS>
The
evening
glided
swiftly
away
,
in
these
cheerful
recreations
;
and
when
the
substantial
though
homely
supper
had
been
despatched
,
and
the
little
party
formed
a
social
circle
round
the
fire
<EOS>
,
Mr
Pickwick
thought
he
had
never
felt
so
happy
in
his
life
,
and
at
no
time
so
much
disposed
to
enjoy
,
and
make
the
most
of
,
the
passing
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
this
,
"
said
the
hospitable
host
,
who
was
sitting
in
great
state
next
the
old
lady
's
arm
-
chair
,
with
her
hand
fast
clasped
in
his

"
this
is
just
what
I
like
---
<EOS>
the
happiest
moments
of
my
life
have
been
passed
at
this
old
fireside
;
and
I
am
so
attached
to
it
,
that
I
keep
up
a
blazing
fire
here
every
evening
,
until
it
actually
grows
too
hot
to
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
my
poor
old
mother
,
here
,
used
to
sit
before
this
fireplace
upon
that
little
stool
when
she
was
a
girl
;
did
n't
you
,
mother
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
tear
which
starts
unbidden
to
the
eye
when
the
recollection
of
old
times
and
the
happiness
of
many
years
ago
is
suddenly
recalled
,
stole
down
the
old
lady
's
face
as
she
shook
her
head
with
a
melancholy
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
excuse
my
talking
about
this
old
place
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
resumed
the
host
,
after
a
short
pause
,
"
for
I
love
it
dearly
,
and
know
no
other

<EOS>
the
old
houses

fields
seem
like
living

a
song
when
he
first
came
amongst
us
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
,
have
you
anything
in
your
glass
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Plenty
,
thank
you
,
"
replied
that
gentleman
,
whose
poetic
curiosity
had
been
greatly
excited
by
the
last
observation
of
his
entertainer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
but
you
were
talking
about
the
song
of
the
Ivy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
ask
our
friend
opposite
about
that
,
"
said
the
host
knowingly
,
indicating
the
clergyman
by
a
nod
of
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
say
that
I
should
like
to
hear
you
repeat
it
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
really
,
"
replied
the
clergyman
,
"
it
's
a
very
slight
affair
;
and
the
only
excuse
I
have
for
having
ever
perpetrated
it
is
,
that
I
was
a
young
man
at
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
Such
as
it
is
,
however
,
you
shall
hear
it
,
if
you
wish
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
murmur
of
curiosity
was
of
course
the
reply
;
and
the
old
gentleman
proceeded
to
recite
,
with
the
aid
of
sundry
promptings
from
his
wife
,
the
lines
in
question
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
call
them

THE
IVY
GREEN
   
<EOS>
Oh
,
a
dainty
plant
is
the
Ivy
green
<EOS>
,
That
creepeth
o'er
ruins
old
!
<EOS>
Of
right
choice
food
are
his
meals
,
I
ween
,
<EOS>
In
his
cell
so
lone
and
cold
.
<EOS>
The
wall
must
be
crumbled
,
the
stone
decayed
,
To
pleasure
his
dainty
whim
;
And
the
mouldering
dust
that
years
have
made
,
Is
a
merry
meal
for
him
.
     
<EOS>
Creeping
where
no
life
is
seen
,
     
<EOS>
A
rare
old
plant
is
the
Ivy
green
.
   
<EOS>
Fast
he
stealeth
on
,
though
he
wears
no
wings
,
And
a
staunch
old
heart
has
he
.
<EOS>
How
closely
he
twineth
,
how
tight
he
clings
To
his
friend
the
huge
Oak
Tree
!
<EOS>
And
slily
he
traileth
along
the
ground
,
And
his
leaves
he
gently
waves
,
As
he
joyously
hugs
and
crawleth
round
The
rich
mould
of
dead
men
's
graves
.
     
<EOS>
Creeping
where
grim
death
has
been
,
     
<EOS>
A
rare
old
plant
is
the
Ivy
green

<EOS>
Whole
ages
have
fled
and
their
works
decayed

And
nations
have
scattered
been
;
But
the
stout
old
Ivy
shall
never
fade
,
From
its
hale
and
hearty
green
.
<EOS>
The
brave
old
plant
in
its
lonely
days
,
Shall
fatten
upon
the
past
;
For
the
stateliest
building
man
can
raise
,
Is
the
Ivy
's
food
at
last

Creeping
on
where

While
the
old
gentleman
repeated
these
lines
a
second
time
,
to
enable
Mr
Snodgrass
to
note
them
down
,
Mr
Pickwick
perused
the
lineaments
of
his
face
with
an
expression
of
great
interest
.
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
having
concluded
his
dictation
,
and
Mr
Snodgrass
having
returned
his
note
-
book
to
his
pocket
,
Mr
Pickwick
said
---
   
"
<EOS>
Excuse
me
,
sir
,
for
making
the
remark
on
so
short
an
acquaintance
;
but
a
gentleman
like
yourself
can
not
fail
,
I
should
think
,
to
have
observed
many
scenes
and
incidents
worth
recording
,
in
the
course
of
your
experience
as
a
minister
of
the
Gospel
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
witnessed
some
certainly
,
"
replied
the
old
gentleman
,
"
but
the
incidents
and
characters
have
been
of
a
homely
and
ordinary
nature
,
my
sphere
of
action
being
so
very
limited
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
did
make
some
notes
,
I
think
,
about
John
Edmunds
,
did
you
not
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Wardle
,
who
appeared
very
desirous
to
draw
his
friend
out
,
for
the
edification
of
his
new
visitors
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
slightly
nodded
his
head
in
token
of
assent
,
and
was
proceeding
to
change
the
subject
,
when
Mr
Pickwick
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
but
pray
,
if
I
may
venture
to
inquire
,
who
was
John
Edmunds
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
very
thing
I
was
about
to
ask
,
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
eagerly
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
fairly
in
for
it
,
"
said
the
jolly
host
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
these
gentlemen
,
sooner
or
later
;
so
you
had
better
take
advantage
of
this
favourable
opportunity
,
and
do
so
at
once
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
smiled
good
-
humouredly
as
he
drew
his
chair
forward
---
the
remainder
of
the
party
drew
their
chairs
closer
together
,
especially
Mr
Tupman
and
the
spinster
aunt
,
who
were
possibly
rather
hard
of
hearing
;
and
the
old
lady
's
ear
-
trumpet
having
been
duly
adjusted
,
and
Mr
Miller
(
who
had
fallen
asleep
during
the
recital
of
the
verses
)
roused
from
his
slumbers
by
an
admonitory
pinch
,
administered
beneath
the
table
by
his
ex
-
partner
the
solemn
fat
man
,
the
old
gentleman
,
without
further
preface
,
commenced
the
following
tale
,
to
which
we
have
taken
the
liberty
of
prefixing
the
title
of
     
THE
CONVICT
'S
RETURN
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
first
settled
in
this
village
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
"
which
is
now
just
five
-
and
-
twenty
years
ago
,
the
most
notorious
person
among
my
parishioners
was
a
man
of
the
name
of
Edmunds
,
who
leased
a
small
farm
near
this
spot
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
morose
,
savage
-
hearted
,
bad
man
;
idle
and
dissolute
in
his
habits
;
cruel
and
ferocious
in
his
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
Beyond
the
few
lazy
and
reckless
vagabonds
with
whom
he
sauntered
away
his
time
in
the
fields
,
or
sotted
in
the
ale
-
house
,
he
had
not
a
single
friend
or
acquaintance
;
no
one
cared
to
speak
to
the
man
whom
many
feared
,
and
every
one
detested
---
and
Edmunds
was
shunned
by
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
man
had
a
wife
and
one
son
,
who
,
when
I
first
came
here
,
was
about
twelve
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
acuteness
of
that
woman
's
sufferings
,
of
the
gentle
and
enduring
manner
in
which
she
bore
them
,
of
the
agony
of
solicitude
with
which
she
reared
that
boy
,
no
one
can
form
an
adequate
conception
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
forgive
me
the
supposition
,
if
it
be
an
uncharitable
one
,
but
I
do
firmly
and
in
my
soul
believe
,
that
the
man
systematically
tried
for
many
years
to
break
her
heart
;
but
she
bore
it
all
for
her
child
's
sake
,
and
,
however
strange
it
may
seem
to
many
,
for
his
father
's
too
;
for
brute
as
he
was
,
and
cruelly
as
he
had
treated
her
,
she
had
loved
him
once
;
and
the
recollection
of
what
he
had
been
to
her
,
awakened
feelings
of
forbearance
and
meekness
under
suffering
in
her
bosom
,
to
which
all
God
's
creatures
,
but
women
,
are
strangers
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
were
poor
---
they
could
not
be
otherwise
when
the
man
pursued
such
courses
;
but
the
woman
's
unceasing
and
unwearied
exertions
,
early
and
late
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
,
kept
them
above
actual
want
.
 
<EOS>
These
exertions
were
but
ill
repaid
.
<EOS>
People
who
passed
the
spot
in
the
evening
---
sometimes
at
a
late
hour
of
the
night
---
reported
that
they
had
heard
the
moans
and
sobs
of
a
woman
in
distress
,
and
the
sound
of
blows
;
and
more
than
once
,
when
it
was
past
midnight
,
the
boy
knocked
softly
at
the
door
of
a
neighbour
's
house
,
whither
he
had
been
sent
,
to
escape
the
drunken
fury
of
his
unnatural
father
.
   
<EOS>
"
During
the
whole
of
this
time
,
and
when
the
poor
creature
often
bore
about
her
marks
of
ill
-
usage
and
violence
which
she
could
not
wholly
conceal
,
she
was
a
constant
attendant
at
our
little
church
.
 
<EOS>
Regularly
every
Sunday
,
morning
and
afternoon
,
she
occupied
the
same
seat
with
the
boy
at
her
side
;
and
though
they
were
both
poorly
dressed
---
much
more
so
than
many
of
their
neighbours
who
were
in
a
lower
station
---
they
were
always
neat
and
clean
.
 
<EOS>
Every
one
had
a
friendly
nod
and
a
kind
word
for
"
poor
Mrs
Edmunds
"
;
and
sometimes
,
when
she
stopped
to
exchange
a
few
words
with
a
neighbour
at
the
conclusion
of
the
service
in
the
little
row
of
elm
-
trees
which
leads
to
the
church
porch
,
or
lingered
behind
to
gaze
with
a
mother
's
pride
and
fondness
upon
her
healthy
boy
,
as
he
sported
before
her
with
some
little
companions
,
her
careworn
face
would
lighten
up
with
an
expression
of
heartfelt
gratitude
;
and
she
would
look
,
if
not
cheerful
and
happy
,
at
least
tranquil
and
contented
.
   
<EOS>
"
Five
or
six
years
passed
away
;
the
boy
had
become
a
robust
and
well
-
grown
youth
.
 
<EOS>
The
time
that
had
strengthened
the
child
's
slight
frame
and
knit
his
weak
limbs
into
the
strength
of
manhood
had
bowed
his
mother
's
form
,
and
enfeebled
her
steps
;
but
the
arm
that
should
have
supported
her
was
no
longer
locked
in
hers
;
the
face
that
should
have
cheered
her
,
no
more
looked
upon
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
She
occupied
her
old
seat
,
but
there
was
a
vacant
one
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bible
was
kept
as
carefully
as
ever
,
the
places
were
found
and
folded
down
as
they
used
to
be
:
but
there
was
no
one
to
read
it
with
her
;
and
the
tears
fell
thick
and
fast
upon
the
book
,
and
blotted
the
words
from
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Neighbours
were
as
kind
as
they
were
wo
nt
to
be
of
old
,
but
she
shunned
their
greetings
with
averted
head
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
lingering
among
the
old
elm
-
trees
now
-
no
cheering
anticipations
of
happiness
yet
in
store
.
 
<EOS>
The
desolate
woman
drew
her
bonnet
closer
over
her
face
,
and
walked
hurriedly
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
tell
you
that
the
young
man
,
who
,
looking
back
to
the
earliest
of
his
childhood
's
days
to
which
memory
and
consciousness
extended
,
and
carrying
his
recollection
down
to
that
moment
,
could
remember
nothing
which
was
not
in
some
way
connected
with
a
long
series
of
voluntary
privations
suffered
by
his
mother
for
his
sake
,
with
ill
-
usage
,
and
insult
,
and
violence
,
and
all
endured
for
him
---
shall
I
tell
you
,
that
he
,
with
a
reckless
disregard
for
her
breaking
heart
,
and
a
sullen
,
wilful
forgetfulness
of
all
she
had
done
and
borne
for
him
,
had
linked
himself
with
depraved
and
abandoned
men
,
and
was
madly
pursuing
a
headlong
career
,
which
must
bring
death
to
him
,
and
shame
to
her
?
<EOS>
Alas
for
human
nature
!
<EOS>
You
have
anticipated
it
long
since

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
measure
of
the
unhappy
woman
's
misery
and
misfortune
was
about
to
be
completed
.
 
<EOS>
Numerous
offences
had
been
committed
in
the
neighbourhood
;
the
perpetrators
remained
undiscovered
,
and
their
boldness
increased
.
 
<EOS>
A
robbery
of
a
daring
and
aggravated
nature
occasioned
a
vigilance
of
pursuit
,
and
a
strictness
of
search
,
they
had
not
calculated
on
.
 
<EOS>
Young
Edmunds
was
suspected
,
with
three
companions
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
apprehended
---
committed
---
tried
---
condemned
---
to
die
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
wild
and
piercing
shriek
from
a
woman
's
voice
,
which
resounded
through
the
court
when
the
solemn
sentence
was
pronounced
,
rings
in
my
ears
at
this
moment
.
 
<EOS>
That
cry
struck
a
terror
to
the
culprit
's
heart
,
which
trial
,
condemnation
---
the
approach
of
death
itself
,
had
failed
to
awaken
.
 
<EOS>
The
lips
which
had
been
compressed
in
dogged
sullenness
throughout
,
quivered
and
parted
involuntarily
;
the
face
turned
ashy
pale
as
the
cold
perspiration
broke
forth
from
every
pore
;
the
sturdy
limbs
of
the
felon
trembled
,
and
he
staggered
in
the
dock
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
first
transports
of
her
mental
anguish
,
the
suffering
mother
threw
herself
on
her
knees
at
my
feet
,
and
fervently
sought
the
Almighty
Being
who
had
hitherto
supported
her
in
all
her
troubles
to
release
her
from
a
world
of
woe
and
misery
,
and
to
spare
the
life
of
her
only
child
.
 
<EOS>
A
burst
of
grief
,
and
a
violent
struggle
,
such
as
<EOS>
I
hope
I
may
never
have
to
witness
again
,
succeeded
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
that
her
heart
was
breaking
from
that
hour
;
but
I
never
once
heard
complaint
or
murmur
escape
her
lips
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
piteous
spectacle
to
see
that
woman
in
the
prison
-
yard
from
day
to
day
,
eagerly
and
fervently
attempting
,
by
affection
and
entreaty
,
to
soften
the
hard
heart
of
her
obdurate
son
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
He
remained
moody
,
obstinate
,
and
unmoved
.
 
<EOS>
Not
even
the
unlooked
-
for
commutation
of
his
sentence
to
transportation
for
fourteen
years
,
softened
for
an
instant
the
sullen
hardihood
of
his
demeanour
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
the
spirit
of
resignation
and
endurance
that
had
so
long
upheld
her
,
was
unable
to
contend
against
bodily
weakness
and
infirmity
.
 
<EOS>
She
fell
sick
.
 
<EOS>
She
dragged
her
tottering
limbs
from
the
bed
to
visit
her
son
once
more
,
but
her
strength
failed
her
,
and
she
sank
powerless
on
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
the
boasted
coldness
and
indifference
of
the
young
man
were
tested
indeed
;
and
the
retribution
that
fell
heavily
upon
him
nearly
drove
him
mad
.
 
<EOS>
A
day
passed
away
and
his
mother
was
not
there
;
another
flew
by
,
and
she
came
not
near
him
;
a
third
evening
arrived
,
and
yet
he
had
not
seen
her
---
,
and
in
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
he
was
to
be
separated
from
her
,
perhaps
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
the
long
-
forgotten
thoughts
of
former
days
rushed
upon
his
mind
,
as
he
almost
ran
up
and
down
the
narrow
yard
---
as
if
intelligence
would
arrive
the
sooner
for
his
hurrying
---
and
how
bitterly
a
sense
of
his
helplessness
and
desolation
rushed
upon
him
,
when
he
heard
the
truth
!

His
mother
,
the
only
parent
he
had
ever
known
,
lay
ill
---
it
might
be
,
dying
---
within
one
mile
of
the
ground
he
stood
on
;
were
he
free
and
unfettered
,
a
few
minutes
would
place
him
by
her
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
rushed
to
the
gate
,
and
grasping
the
iron
rails
with
the
energy
of
desperation
,
shook
it
till
it
rang
again
,
and
threw
himself
against
the
thick
wall
as
if
to
force
a
passage
through
the
stone
;
but
the
strong
building
mocked
his
feeble
efforts
,
and
he
beat
his
hands
together
and
wept
like
a
child
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
bore
the
mother
's
forgiveness
and
blessing
to
her
son
in
prison
;
and
I
carried
the
solemn
assurance
of
repentance
,
and
his
fervent
supplication
for
pardon
,
to
her
sick
-
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
,
with
pity
and
compassion
,
the
repentant
man
devise
a
thousand
little
plans
for
her
comfort
and
support
when
he
returned
;
but
I
knew
that
many
months
before
he
could
reach
his
place
of
destination
,
his
mother
would
be
no
longer
of
this
world
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
removed
by
night
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
weeks
afterwards
the
poor
woman
's
soul
took
its
flight
,
I
confidently
hope
,
and
solemnly
believe
,
to
a
place
of
eternal
happiness
and
rest
.
 
<EOS>
I
performed
the
burial
service
over
her
remains
.
 
<EOS>
She
lies
in
our
little
churchyard
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
stone
at
her
grave
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
Her
sorrows
were
known
to
man
;
her
virtues
to
God
.
<EOS>
"
it
had
been
arranged
previously
to
the
convict
's
departure
,
that
he
should
write
to
his
mother
as
soon
as
he
could
obtain
permission
,
and
that
the
letter
should
be
addressed
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
father
had
positively
refused
to
see
his
son
from
the
moment
of
his
apprehension
;
and
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
whether
he
lived
or
died
.
 
<EOS>
Many
years
passed
over
without
any
intelligence
of
him
;
and
when
more
than
half
his
term
of
transportation
had
expired
,
and
I
had
received
no
letter
,
I
concluded
him
to
be
dead
,
as
,
indeed
<EOS>
,
I
almost
hoped
he
might
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
Edmunds
,
however
,
had
been
sent
a
considerable
distance
up
the
country
on
his
arrival
at
the
settlement
;
and
to
this
circumstance
,
perhaps
,
may
be
attributed
the
fact
,
that
though
several
letters
were
despatched
,
none
of
them
ever
reached
my
hands
.
<EOS>
He
remained
in
the
same
place
during
the
whole
fourteen
years
.
<EOS>
At
the
expiration
of
the
term
,
steadily
adhering
to
his
old
resolution
and
the
pledge
he
gave
his
mother
,
he
made
his
way
back
to
England
amidst
innumerable
difficulties
,
and
returned
,
on
foot
,
to
his
native
place
.
   
<EOS>
"
On
a
fine
Sunday
evening
,
in
the
month
of
August
,
John
Edmunds
set
foot
in
the
village
he
had
left
with
shame
and
disgrace
seventeen
years
before
.
 
<EOS>
His
nearest
way
lay
through
the
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
's
heart
swelled
as
he
crossed
the
stile
.
 
<EOS>
The
tall
old
elms
,
through
whose
branches
the
declining
sun
cast
here
and
there
a
rich
ray
of
light
upon
the
shady
part
,
awakened
the
associations
of
his
earliest
days
.
 
<EOS>
He
pictured
himself
as
he
was
then
,
clinging
to
his
mother
's
hand
,
and
walking
peacefully
to
church
.
 
<EOS>
He
remembered
how
he
used
to
look
up
into
her
pale
face
;
and
how
her
eyes
would
sometimes
fill
with
tears
as
she
gazed
upon
his
features
---
tears
which
fell
hot
upon
his
forehead
as
she
stooped
to
kiss
him
,
and
made
him
weep
too
,
although
he
little
knew
then
what
bitter
tears
hers
were
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
how
often
he
had
run
merrily
down
that
path
with
some
childish
playfellow
,
looking
back
,
ever
and
again
,
to
catch
his
mother
's
smile
,
or
hear
her
gentle
voice
;
and
then
a
veil
seemed
lifted
from
his
memory
,
and
words
of
kindness
unrequited
,
and
warnings
despised
,
and
promises
broken
,
thronged
upon
his
recollection
till
his
heart
failed
him
,
and
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
entered
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
The
evening
service
was
concluded
and
the
congregation
had
dispersed
,
but
it
was
not
yet
closed
.
 
<EOS>
His
steps
echoed
through
the
low
building
with
a
hollow
sound
,
and
he
almost
feared
to
be
alone
,
it
was
so
still
and
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
round
him
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
was
changed
.
 
<EOS>
The
place
seemed
smaller
than
it
used
to
be
;
but
there
were
the
old
monuments
on
which
he
had
gazed
with
childish
awe
a
thousand
times
;
the
little
pulpit
with
its
faded
cushion
;
the
Communion
table
before
which
he
had
so
often
repeated
the
Commandments
he
had
reverenced
as
a
child
,
and
forgotten
as
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
approached
the
old
seat
;
it
looked
cold
and
desolate
.
 
<EOS>
The
cushion
had
been
removed
,
and
the
Bible
was
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
his
mother
now
occupied
a
poorer
seat
,
or
possibly
she
had
grown
infirm
and
could
not
reach
the
church
alone
.
 
<EOS>
He
dared
not
think
of
what
he
feared
.
 
<EOS>
A
cold
feeling
crept
over
him
,
and
he
trembled
violently
as
he
turned
away
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
old
man
entered
the
porch
just
as
he
reached
it
.
 
<EOS>
Edmunds
started
back
,
for
he
knew
him
well
;
many
a
time
he
had
watched
him
digging
graves
in
the
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
What
would
he
say
to
the
returned
convict
?
   
<EOS>
"
The
old
man
raised
his
eyes
to
the
stranger
's
face
,
bade
him
"
good
-
evening
,
"
and
walked
slowly
on
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
forgotten
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
walked
down
the
hill
,
and
through
the
village
.
 
<EOS>
The
weather
was
warm
,
and
the
people
were
sitting
at
their
doors
,
or
strolling
in
their
little
gardens
as
he
passed
,
enjoying
the
serenity
of
the
evening
,
and
their
rest
from
labour
.
 
<EOS>
Many
a
look
was
turned
towards
him
,
and
many
a
doubtful
glance
he
cast
on
either
side
to
see
whether
any
knew
and
shunned
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
strange
faces
in
almost
every
house
;
in
some
he
recognised
the
burly
form
of
some
old
schoolfellow
---
a
boy
when
he
last
saw
him
---
surrounded
by
a
troop
of
merry
children
;
in
others
he
saw
,
seated
in
an
easy
-
chair
at
a
cottage
door
,
a
feeble
and
infirm
old
man
,
whom
he
only
remembered
as
a
hale
and
hearty
labourer
;
but
they
had
all
forgotten
him
,
and
he
passed
on
unknown
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
last
soft
light
of
the
setting
sun
had
fallen
on
the
earth
,
casting
a
rich
glow
on
the
yellow
corn
sheaves
,
and
lengthening
the
shadows
of
the
orchard
trees
,
as
he
stood
before
the
old
house
 
---
the
home
of
his
infancy
---
to
which
his
heart
had
yearned
with
an
intensity
of
affection
not
to
be
described
,
through
long
and
weary
years
of
captivity
and
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
The
paling
was
low
,
though
he
well
remembered
the
time
that
it
had
seemed
a
high
wall
to
him
;
and
he
looked
over
into
the
old
garden
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
more
seeds
and
gayer
flowers
than
there
used
to
be
,
but
there
were
the
old
trees
still
---
the
very
tree
under
which
he
had
lain
a
thousand
times
when
tired
of
playing
in
the
sun
,
and
felt
the
soft
,
mild
sleep
of
happy
boyhood
steal
gently
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
voices
within
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
listened
,
but
they
fell
strangely
upon
his
ear
;
he
knew
them
not
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
merry
too
;
and
he
well
knew
that
his
poor
old
mother
could
not
be
cheerful
,
and
he
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
opened
,
and
a
group
of
little
children
bounded
out
,
shouting
and
romping
.
 
<EOS>
The
father
,
with
a
little
boy
in
his
arms
,
appeared
at
the
door
,
and
they
crowded
round
him
,
clapping
their
tiny
hands
,
and
dragging
him
out
,
to
join
their
joyous
sports
.
 
<EOS>
The
convict
thought
on
the
many
times
he
had
shrunk
from
his
father
's
sight
in
that
very
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
remembered
how
often
he
had
buried
his
trembling
head
beneath
the
bedclothes
,
and
heard
the
harsh
word
,
and
the
hard
stripe
,
and
his
mother
's
wailing
;
and
though
the
man
sobbed
aloud
with
agony
of
mind
as
he
left
the
spot
,
his
fist
was
clenched
,
and
his
teeth
were
set
,
in
a
fierce
and
deadly
passion
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
such
was
the
return
to
which
he
had
looked
through
the
weary
perspective
of
many
years
,
and
for
which
he
had
undergone
so
much
suffering
!
<EOS>
No
face
of
welcome
,
no
look
of
forgiveness
,
no
house
to
receive
,
no
hand
to
help
him
---
and
this
too
in
the
old
village
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
his
loneliness
in
the
wild
,
thick
woods
,
where
man
was
never
seen
,
to
this
!
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
felt
that
in
the
distant
land
of
his
bondage
and
infamy
,
he
had
thought
of
his
native
place
as
it
was
when
he
left
it
;
and
not
as
it
would
be
when
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
The
sad
reality
struck
coldly
at
his
heart
,
and
his
spirit
sank
within
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
courage
to
make
inquiries
,
or
to
present
himself
to
the
only
person
who
was
likely
to
receive
him
with
kindness
and
compassion
.
 
<EOS>
He
walked
slowly
on
;
and
shunning
the
roadside
like
a
guilty
man
,
turned
into
a
meadow
he
well
remembered
;
and
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
,
threw
himself
upon
the
grass
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
had
not
observed
that
a
man
was
lying
on
the
bank
beside
him
;
his
garments
rustled
as
he
turned
round
to
steal
a
look
at
the
new
-
comer
;
and
Edmunds
raised
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
man
had
moved
into
a
sitting
posture
.
 
<EOS>
His
body
was
much
bent
,
and
his
face
was
wrinkled
and
yellow
.
 
<EOS>
His
dress
denoted
him
an
inmate
of
the
workhouse
:
he
had
the
appearance
of
being
very
old
,
but
it
looked
more
the
effect
of
dissipation
or
disease
,
than
the
length
of
years
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
staring
hard
at
the
stranger
,
and
though
his
eyes
were
lustreless
and
heavy
at
first
,
they
appeared
to
glow
with
an
unnatural
and
alarmed
expression
after
they
had
been
fixed
upon
him
for
a
short
time
,
until
they
seemed
to
be
starting
from
their
sockets
.
 
<EOS>
Edmunds
gradually
raised
himself
to
his
knees
,
and
looked
more
and
more
earnestly
on
the
old
man
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
They
gazed
upon
each
other
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
old
man
was
ghastly
pale
.
 
<EOS>
He
shuddered
and
tottered
to
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
Edmunds
sprang
to
his
.
 
<EOS>
He
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
.
<EOS>
Edmunds
advanced
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Let
me
hear
you
speak
,
"
said
the
convict
,
in
a
thick
,
broken
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Stand
off
!
"
cried
the
old
man
,
with
a
dreadful
oath
.
 
<EOS>
The
convict
drew
closer
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Stand
off
!
"
shrieked
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
Furious
with
terror
,
he
raised
his
stick
,
and
struck
Edmunds
a
heavy
blow
across
the
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Father
---
devil
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
the
convict
between
his
set
teeth
.
 
<EOS>
He
rushed
wildly
forward
,
and
clenched
the
old
man
by
the
throat
---
but
he
was
his
father
;
and
his
arm
fell
powerless
by
his
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
old
man
uttered
a
loud
yell
which
rang
through
the
lonely
fields
like
the
howl
of
an
evil
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
turned
black
,
the
gore
rushed
from
his
mouth
and
nose
,
and
dyed
the
grass
a
deep
,
dark
red
,
as
he
staggered
and
fell
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
ruptured
a
blood
-
vessel
,
and
he
was
a
dead
man
before
his
son
could
raise
him
.
"
<EOS>
In
that
corner
of
the
churchyard
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
after
a
silence
of
a
few
moments
,
"
in
that
corner
of
the
churchyard
of
which
I
have
before
spoken
,
there
lies
buried
a
man
who
was
in
my
employment
for
three
years
after
this
event
,
and
who
was
truly
contrite
,
penitent
,
and
humbled
,
if
ever
man
was

<EOS>
No
one
save
myself
knew
in
that
man
's
lifetime
who
he
was
,
or
whence
he
came

it
was
John
Edmunds
,
the
returned
convict

How
Mr
Winkle
,
instead
of
shooting
at
the
pigeon
and
killing
the
crow
,
shot
at
the
crow
and
wounded
the
pigeon
;
how

and
how
All

Dell
expense
;
with
other
interesting
and
instructive
matters
 
The
fatiguing
adventures
of
the
day
or
the
somniferous
influence
of
the
clergyman
's
tale
operated
so
strongly
on
the
drowsy
tendencies
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
that
in
less
than
five
minutes
after
he
had
been
shown
to
his
comfortable
bedroom
he
fell
into
a
sound
and
dreamless
sleep
,
from
which
he
was
only
awakened
by
the
morning
sun
darting
his
bright
beams
reproachfully
into
the
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
no
sluggard
,

he
sprang
like
an
ardent
warrior
from
his
tent
-
bedstead

<EOS>
"
Pleasant

sighed
the
enthusiastic
gentleman
,
as
he
opened
his
lattice
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
could
live
to
gaze
from
day

had
once
felt
the

this

to
drag
out
a

"
<EOS>
and
,
having
cross
-
examined
solitude
after
the
most
approved
precedents
,
at
considerable
length
,
Mr
Pickwick
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
lattice
and
looked
around
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
rich
,
sweet
smell
of
the
hay
-
ricks
rose
to
his
chamber
window
;
the
hundred
perfumes
of
the
little
flower
-
garden
beneath
scented
the
air
around
;
the
deep
-
green
meadows
shone
in
the
morning
dew
that
glistened
on
every
leaf
as
it
trembled
in
the
gentle
air
;
and
the
birds
sang
as
if
every
sparkling
drop
were
to
them
a
fountain
of
inspiration
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
fell
into
an
enchanting
and
delicious
reverie
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
sound
that
roused
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
looked
to
the
right
,
but
he
saw
nobody
;
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
left
,
and
pierced
the
prospect
;
he
stared
into
the
sky
,
but
he
was
n't
wanted
there
;
and
then
he
did
what
a
common
mind
would
have
done
at
once
---
looked
into
the
garden
,
and
there
saw
Mr
Wardle
.
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
?
"
said
the
good
-
humoured
individual
,
out
of
breath
with
his
own
anticipations
of
pleasure
.
"
<EOS>
Beautiful
morning
,
ai
n't
it
?
<EOS>
Glad
to
see
you
up
so
early
.
 
<EOS>
Make
haste
down
,
and
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
wait
for
you
here
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
needed
no
second
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
Ten
minutes
sufficed
for
the
completion
of
his
toilet
,
and
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
he
was
by
the
old
gentleman
's
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
in
his
turn
,
seeing
that
his
companion
was
armed
with
a
gun
,
and
that
another
lay
ready
on
the
grass
;
"
what
's
going
forward
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
your
friend
and
I
,
"
replied
the
host
,
"
are
going
out
rook
-
shooting
before
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
very
good
shot
,
ai
n't
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
heard
him
say
he
's
a
capital
one
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
but
I
never
saw
him
aim
at
anything
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
the
host
,
"
I
wish
he
'd
come
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
---
Joe
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
,
who
under
the
exciting
influence
of
the
morning
did
not
appear
to
be
more
than
three
parts
and
a
fraction
asleep
,
emerged
from
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
up
,
and
call
the
gentleman
,
and
tell
him
he
'll
find
me
and
Mr
Pickwick
in
the
rookery
.
 
<EOS>
Show
the
gentleman
the
way
there
;
d'ye
hear
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
boy
departed
to
execute
his
commission
;
and
the
host
,
carrying
both
guns
like
a
second
Robinson
Crusoe
,
led
the
way
from
the
garden
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
place
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
pausing
after
a
few
minutes
walking
,
in
an
avenue
of
trees
.
 
<EOS>
The
information
was
unnecessary
;
for
the
incessant
cawing
of
the
unconscious
rooks
sufficiently
indicated
their
whereabouts
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
laid
one
gun
on
the
ground
,
and
loaded
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
they
are
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
and
,
as
he
spoke
,
the
forms
of
Mr
Tupman
,
Mr
Snodgrass
,
and
Mr
Winkle
appeared
in
the
distance
.
 
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
,
not
being
quite
certain
<EOS>
which
gentleman
he
was
directed
to
call
,
had
with
peculiar
sagacity
,
and
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
any
mistake
,
called
them
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
along
,
"
shouted
the
old
gentleman
,
addressing
Mr
Winkle
;
"
a
keen
hand
like
you
ought
to
have
been
up
long
ago
,
even
to
such
poor
work
as
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
responded
with
a
forced
smile
,
and
took
up
the
spare
gun
with
an
expression
of
countenance
which
a
metaphysical
rook
,
impressed
with
a
foreboding
of
his
approaching
death
by
violence
,
may
be
supposed
to
assume
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
keenness
,
but
it
looked
remarkably
like
misery
.
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
nodded
;
and
two
ragged
boys
who
had
been
marshalled
to
the
spot
under
the
direction
of
the
infant
Lambert
,
forthwith
commenced
climbing
up
two
of
the
trees
.
<EOS>
"
What
are
these
lads
for
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
abruptly
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
rather
alarmed
;
for
he
was
not
quite
certain
but
that
the
distress
of
the
agricultural
interest
,
about
which
he
had
often
heard
a
great
deal
,
might
have
compelled
the
small
boys
attached
to
the
soil
to
earn
a
precarious
and
hazardous
subsistence
by
making
marks
of
themselves
for
inexperienced
sportsmen
.
<EOS>
"
Only
to
start
the
game
,
"
replied
Mr
Wardle
,
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
what
?
"
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
in
plain
English
,
to
frighten
the
rooks
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
is
that
all
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
satisfied
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
begin
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
glad
of
any
respite
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stand
aside
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
Now
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
boy
shouted
,
and
shook
a
branch
with
a
nest
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
Half
a
dozen
young
rooks
in
violent
conversation
,
flew
out
to
ask
what
the
matter
was
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
fired
by
way
of
reply
.
 
<EOS>
Down
fell
one
bird
,
and
off
flew
the
others
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
him
up
,
Joe
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
smile
upon
the
youth
's
face
as
he
advanced
.
<EOS>
Indistinct
visions
of
rook
-
pie
floated
through
his
imagination
.
<EOS>
He
laughed
as
he
retired
with
the
bird
---
it
was
a
plump
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr
Winkle
,
"
said
the
host
,
reloading
his
own
gun
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fire
away
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
advanced
,
and
levelled
his
gun
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
friends
cowered
involuntarily
to
escape
damage
from
the
heavy
fall
of
rooks
,
which
they
felt
quite
certain
would
be
occasioned
by
the
devastating
barrel
of
their
friend
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
solemn
pause
---
a
shout
---
a
flapping
of
wings
---
a
faint
click
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
it
go
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Missed
fire
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
who
was
very
pale
---
probably
from
disappointment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Odd
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
taking
the
gun
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
knew
one
of
them
miss
fire
before
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
do
n't
see
anything
of
the
cap
.
"
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
soul
!
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
"
I
declare
I
forgot
the
cap
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
slight
omission
was
rectified
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
crouched
again
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
stepped
forward
with
an
air
of
determination
and
resolution
;
and
Mr
Tupman
looked
out
from
behind
a
tree
.
<EOS>
The
boy
shouted
;
four
birds
flew
out
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
fired
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
scream
as
of
an
individual
---
not
a
rook
---
in
corporal
anguish
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
had
saved
the
lives
of
innumerable
unoffending
birds
by
receiving
a
portion
of
the
charge
in
his
left
arm
.
   
<EOS>
To
describe
the
confusion
that
ensued
would
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
To
tell
how
Mr
Pickwick
in
the
first
transports
of
emotion
called
Mr
Winkle
"
Wretch
!
"
<EOS>
how
Mr
Tupman
lay
prostrate
on
the
ground
;
and
how
Mr
Winkle
knelt
horror
-
stricken
beside
him
;
how
Mr
Tupman
called
distractedly
upon
some
feminine
Christian
name
,
and
then
opened
first
one
eye
,
and
then
the
other
,
and
then
fell
back
and
shut
them
both
---
all
this
would
be
as
difficult
to
describe
in
detail
,
as
it
would
be
to
depict
the
gradual
recovering
of
the
unfortunate
individual
,
the
binding
up
of
his
arm
with
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
,
and
the
conveying
him
back
by
slow
degrees
supported
by
the
arms
of
his
anxious
friends
.
   
<EOS>
They
drew
near
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
ladies
were
at
the
garden
gate
,
waiting
for
their
arrival
and
their
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
The
spinster
aunt
appeared
;
she
smiled
,
and
beckoned
them
to
walk
quicker
.
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
evident
<EOS>
she
knew
not
of
the
disaster
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
thing
!
<EOS>
there
are
times
when
ignorance
is
bliss
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
They
approached
nearer
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
what
is
the
matter
with
the
little
old
gentleman
?
"
said
Isabella
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
The
spinster
aunt
heeded
not
the
remark
;
she
thought
it
applied
to
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
In
her
eyes
Tracy
Tupman
was
a
youth
;
she
viewed
his
years
through
a
diminishing
glass
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
frightened
,
"
called
out
the
old
host
,
fearful
of
alarming
his
daughters
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
party
had
crowded
so
completely
round
Mr
Tupman
,
that
they
could
not
yet
clearly
discern
the
nature
of
the
accident
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
frightened
,
"
said
the
host
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
screamed
the
ladies
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Tupman
has
met
with
a
little
accident
;
that
's
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
spinster
aunt
uttered
a
piercing
scream
,
burst
into
an
hysteric
laugh
,
and
fell
backwards
in
the
arms
of
her
nieces
.
   
<EOS>
"
Throw
some
cold
water
over
her
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
murmured
the
spinster
aunt
;
"
I
am
better
now
.
<EOS>
Bella
,
Emily
---
a
surgeon
!
 
<EOS>
Is
he
wounded
?
<EOS>
---
Is
he
dead
?
<EOS>
---
Is
he
---
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
the
spinster
aunt
burst
into
fit
number
two
,
of
hysteric
laughter
interspersed
with
screams
.
   
<EOS>
"
Calm
yourself
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
affected
almost
to
tears
by
this
expression
of
sympathy
with
his
sufferings
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
madam
,
calm
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
his
voice
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
spinster
aunt
;
and
strong
symptoms
of
fit
number
three
developed
themselves
forthwith
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
not
agitate
yourself
,
I
entreat
you
,
dearest
madam
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
soothingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
little
hurt
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
not
dead
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
hysterical
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
say
you
are
not
dead
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
a
fool
,
Rachael
,
"
interposed
Mr
Wardle
,
rather
more
roughly
than
was
consistent
with
the
poetic
nature
of
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
's
the
use
of
his
saying
he
is
n't
dead
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
I
am
not
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
require
no
assistance
but
yours
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
lean
on
your
arm
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
added
,
in
a
whisper
,
"
Oh
,
Miss
Rachael
!
"
<EOS>
The
agitated
female
advanced
,
and
offered
her
arm
.
 
<EOS>
They
turned
into
the
breakfast
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tracy
Tupman
gently
pressed
her
hand
to
his
lips
,
and
sank
upon
the
sofa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
faint
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
anxious
Rachael
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
better
presently
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
closed
his
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
sleeps
,
"
murmured
the
spinster
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
(
His
organs
of
vision
had
been
closed
nearly
twenty
seconds
.
)
<EOS>
"
Dear
---
dear
---
Mr
Tupman
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
jumped
up
---
"
Oh
,
say
those
words
again
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
   
<EOS>
The
lady
started
.
 
<EOS>
"
Surely
you
did
not
hear
them
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
bashfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
,
I
did
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Mr
Tupman
;
"
repeat
them
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
would
have
me
recover
,
repeat
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
said
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
brother
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Tracy
Tupman
resumed
his
former
position
;
and
Mr
Wardle
,
accompanied
by
a
surgeon
,
entered
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
The
arm
was
examined
,
the
wound
dressed
,
and
pronounced
to
be
a
very
slight
one
;
and
the
minds
of
the
company
having
been
thus
satisfied
,
they
proceeded
to
satisfy
their
appetites
with
countenances
to
which
an
expression
of
cheerfulness
was
again
restored
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
alone
was
silent
and
reserved
.
 
<EOS>
Doubt
and
distrust
were
exhibited
in
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
His
confidence
in
Mr
Winkle
had
been
shaken
---
greatly
shaken
---
by
the
proceedings
of
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
a
cricketer
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Wardle
of
the
marksman
.
   
<EOS>
At
any
other
time
,
Mr
Winkle
would
have
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
the
delicacy
of
his
situation
,
and
modestly
replied
,
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
,
sir
?
"
inquired
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
once
upon
a
time
,
"
replied
the
host
;
"
but
I
have
given
it
up
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
subscribe
to
the
club
here
,
but
I
do
n't
play
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
grand
match
is
played
to
-
day
,
I
believe
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
the
host
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
would
like
to
see
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
am
delighted
to
view
any
sports
which
may
be
safely

and
in
which
the
impotent
effects
of
unskilful
people
do
not
endanger
human
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
paused
,
and
looked
steadily
on
Mr
Winkle
,
who
quailed
beneath
his
leader
's
searching
glance
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
man
withdrew
his
eyes
after
a
few
minutes
,
and
added
:
"
Shall
we
be
justified
in
leaving
our
wounded
friend
to
the
care
of
the
ladies
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
leave
me
in
better
hands
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
impossible
,
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
therefore
settled
that
Mr
Tupman
should
be
left
at
home
in
charge
of
the
females
;
and
that
the
remainder
of
the
guests
,
under
the
guidance
of
Mr
Wardle
,
should
proceed
to
the
spot
where
was
to
be
held
that
trial
of
skill
,
which
had
roused
all
Muggleton
from
its
torpor
,
and
inoculated
Dingley
Dell
with
a
fever
of
excitement
.
   
<EOS>
As
their
walk
,
which
was
not
above
two
miles
long
,
lay
through
shady
lanes
and
sequestered
footpaths
,
and
as
their
conversation
turned
upon
the
delightful
scenery
by
which
they
were
on
every
side
surrounded
,
Mr
Pickwick
was
almost
inclined
to
regret
the
expedition
they
had
used
,
when
he
found
himself
in
the
main
street
of
the
town
of
Muggleton
.
<EOS>
Everybody
whose
genius
has
a
topographical
bent
knows
perfectly
well
that
Muggleton
is
a
corporate
town
,
with
a
mayor
,
burgesses
,
and
freemen
;
and
anybody
who
has
consulted
the
addresses
of
the
mayor
to
the
freemen
,
or
the
freemen
to
the
mayor
,
or
both
to
the
corporation
,
or
all
three
to
Parliament
,
will
learn
from
thence
what
they
ought
to
have
known
before
,
that
Muggleton
is
an
ancient
and
loyal
borough
,
mingling
a
zealous
advocacy
of
Christian
principles
with
a
devoted
attachment
to
commercial
rights
;
in
demonstration
whereof
,
the
mayor
,
corporation
,
and
other
inhabitants
,
have
presented
at
divers
times
,
no
fewer
than
one
thousand
four
hundred
and
twenty
petitions
against
the
continuance
of
negro
slavery
abroad
,
and
an
equal
number
against
any
interference
with
the
factory
system
at
home
;
sixty
-
eight
in
favour
of
the
sale
of
livings
in
the
Church
,
and
eighty
-
six
for
abolishing
Sunday
trading
in
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
stood
in
the
principal
street
of
this
illustrious
town
,
and
gazed
with
an
air
of
curiosity
,
not
unmixed
with
interest
,
on
the
objects
around
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
open
square
for
the
market
-
place
;
and
in
the
centre
of
it
,
a
large
inn
with
a
sign
-
post
in
front
,
displaying
an
object
very
common
in
art
,
but
rarely
met
with
in
nature
---
to
wit
,
a
blue
lion
,
with
three
bow
legs
in
the
air
,
balancing
himself
on
the
extreme
point
of
the
centre
claw
of
his
fourth
foot
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
,
within
sight
,
an
auctioneer
's
and
fire
-
agency
office
,
a
corn
-
factor
's
,
a
linen
-
draper
's
,
a
saddler
's
,
a
distiller
's
,
a
grocer
's
,
and
a
shoe
-
shop
---
<EOS>
the
last
-
mentioned
warehouse
being
also
appropriated
to
the
diffusion
of
hats
,
bonnets
,
wearing
apparel
,
cotton
umbrellas
,
and
useful
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
red
brick
house
with
a
small
paved
courtyard
in
front
,
which
anybody
might
have
known
belonged
to
the
attorney
;
and
there
was
,
moreover
,
another
red
brick
house
with
Venetian
blinds
,
and
a
large
brass
door
-
plate
with
a
very
legible
announcement
that
it
belonged
to
the
surgeon
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
boys
were
making
their
way
to
the
cricket
-
field
;
and
two
or
three
shopkeepers
who
were
standing
at
their
doors
looked
as
if
they
should
like
to
be
making
their
way
to
the
same
spot
,
as
indeed
to
all
appearance
they
might
have
done
,
without
losing
any
great
amount
of
custom
thereby
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
having
paused
to
make
these
observations
,
to
be
noted
down
at
a
more
convenient
period
,
hastened
to
rejoin
his
friends
,
who
had
turned
out
of
the
main
street
,
and
were
already
within
sight
of
the
field
of
battle
.
   
<EOS>
The
wickets
were
pitched
,
and
so
were
a
couple
of
marquees
for
the
rest
and
refreshment
of
the
contending
parties
.
 
<EOS>
The
game
had
not
yet
commenced
.
 
<EOS>
Two
or
three
Dingley
Dellers
,
and
All
-
Muggletonians
,
were
amusing
themselves
with
a
majestic
air
by
throwing
the
ball
carelessly
from
hand
to
hand
;
and
several
other
gentlemen
dressed
like
them
,
in
straw
hats
,
flannel
jackets
,
and
white
trousers
---
a
costume
in
which
they
looked
very
much
like
amateur
stone
-
masons
---
were
sprinkled
about
the
tents
,
towards
one
of
which
Mr
Wardle
conducted
the
party
.
   
<EOS>
Several
dozen
of
"
How
-
are
-
you
's
?
"
hailed
the
old
gentleman
's
arrival
;
and
a
general
raising
of
the
straw
hats
,
and
bending
forward
of
the
flannel
jackets
,
followed
his
introduction
of
his
guests
as
gentlemen
from
London
,
who
were
extremely
anxious
to
witness
the
proceedings
of
the
day
,
with
which
,
he
had
no
doubt
,
they
would
be
greatly
delighted
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
step
into
the
marquee
,
I
think
,
Sir
,
"
said
one
very
stout
gentleman
,
whose
body
and
legs
looked
like
half
a
gigantic
roll
of
flannel
,
elevated
on
a
couple
of
inflated
pillow
-
cases
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
find
it
much
pleasanter
,
Sir
,
"
urged
another
stout
gentleman
,
who
strongly
resembled
the
other
half
of
the
roll
of
flannel
aforesaid
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
very
good
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
way
,
"
said
the
first
speaker
;
"
they
notch
in
here
---
it
's
the
best
place
in
the
whole
field
;
"
and
the
cricketer
,
panting
on
before
,
preceded
them
to
the
tent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Capital
game
---
smart
sport
---
fine
exercise
---
very
,
"
were
the
words
which
fell
upon
Mr
Pickwick
's
ear
as
he
entered
the
tent
;
and
the
first
object
that
met
his
eyes
was
his
green
-
coated
friend
of
the
Rochester
coach
,
holding
forth
,
to
the
no
small
delight
and
edification
of
a
select
circle
of
the
chosen
of
All
-
Muggleton
.
 
<EOS>
His
dress
was
slightly
improved
,
and
he
wore
boots
;
but
there
was
no
mistaking
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
stranger
recognised
his
friends
immediately
;
and
,
darting
forward
and
seizing
Mr
Pickwick
by
the
hand
,
dragged
him
to
a
seat
with
his
usual
impetuosity
,
talking
all
the
while
as
if
the
whole
of
the
arrangements
were
under
his
especial
patronage
and
direction
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
way
---

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
sat
down
as
he
was
bid
,
and
Mr
Winkle
and
Mr
Snodgrass
also
complied
with
the
directions
of
their
mysterious
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Wardle
looked
on
in
silent
wonder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Wardle
---
a
friend
of
mine
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Friend
of
yours
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
,
how
are
you

<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Friend
of
my
friend
's
---
give
me
your
hand
,
sir
"
---
and
the
stranger
grasped
Mr
Wardle
's
hand
with
all
the
fervour
of
a
close
intimacy
of
many
years
,
and
then
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
as
if
to
take
a
full
survey
of
his
face
and
figure
,
and
then
shook
hands
with
him
again
,
if
possible
,
more
warmly
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
;
and
how
came
you
here
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
a
smile
in
which
benevolence
struggled
with
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
Come

"
replied
the
stranger
---
"
stopping
at
Crown

<EOS>
Crown

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
sufficiently
versed
in
the
stranger
's
system
of
stenography
to
infer
from
this
rapid
and
disjointed
communication
that
he
had
,
somehow
or
other
,
contracted
an
acquaintance
with
the
All
-
Muggletons
,
which
he
had
converted
,
by
a
process
peculiar
to
himself
,
into
that
extent
of
good
-
fellowship
on
which
a
general
invitation
may
be
easily
founded
.
 
<EOS>
His
curiosity
was
therefore
satisfied
,
and
putting
on
his
spectacles
he
prepared
himself
to
watch
the
play
which
was
just
commencing
.
   
<EOS>
All
-
Muggleton
had
the
first
innings
;
and
the
interest
became
intense
when
Mr
Dumkins
and
Mr
Podder
,
two
of
the
most
renowned
members
of
that
most
distinguished
club
,
walked
,
bat
in
hand
,
to
their
respective
wickets
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Luffey
,
the
highest
ornament
of
Dingley
Dell
,
was
pitched
to
bowl
against
the
redoubtable
Dumkins
,
and
Mr
Struggles
was
selected
to
do
the
same
kind
office
for
the
hitherto
unconquered
Podder
.
 
<EOS>
Several
players
were
stationed
,
to
"
look
out
,
"
in
different
parts
of
the
field
,
and
each
fixed
himself
into
the
proper
attitude
by
placing
one
hand
on
each
knee
,
and
stooping
very
much
as
if
he
were
"
making
a
back
"
for
some
beginner
at
leap
-
frog
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
regular
players
do
this
sort
of
thing
;
---
indeed
it
is
generally
supposed
that
it
is
quite
impossible
to
look
out
properly
in
any
other
position
.
   
<EOS>
The
umpires
were
stationed
behind
the
wickets
;
the
scorers
were
prepared
to
notch
the
runs
;
a
breathless
silence
ensued
.
<EOS>
Mr
Luffey
retired
a
few
paces
behind
the
wicket
of
the
passive
Podder
,
and
applied
the
ball
to
his
right
eye
for
several
seconds
.
<EOS>
Dumkins
confidently
awaited
its
coming
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
motions
of
Luffey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Play
!
"
<EOS>
suddenly
cried
the
bowler
.
 
<EOS>
The
ball
flew
from
his
hand
straight
and
swift
towards
the
centre
stump
of
the
wicket
.
 
<EOS>
The
wary
Dumkins
was
on
the
alert
:
it
fell
upon
the
tip
of
the
bat
,
and
bounded
far
away
over
the
heads
of
the
scouts
,
who
had
just
stooped
low
enough
to
let
it
fly
over
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Run
---
run
---
another
.
---
<EOS>
Now
,
then
throw
her
up
---
up
with

---
<EOS>
no
---
yes
---
no
---
throw

throw
her
up

"
<EOS>
---
Such
were
the
shouts
which
followed
the
stroke
;
and
at
the
conclusion
of
which
All
-
Muggleton
had
scored
two
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
Podder
behindhand
<EOS>
in
earning
laurels
wherewith
to
garnish
himself
and
Muggleton
.
 
<EOS>
He
blocked
the
doubtful
balls
,
missed
the
bad
ones
,
took
the
good
ones
,
and
sent
them
flying
to
all
parts
of
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
The
scouts
were
hot
and
tired
;
the
bowlers
were
changed
and
bowled
till
their
arms
ached
;
but
Dumkins
and
Podder
remained
unconquered
.
 
<EOS>
Did
an
elderly
gentleman
essay
to
stop
the
progress
of
the
ball
<EOS>
,
it
rolled
between
his
legs
or
slipped
between
his
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
Did
a
slim
gentleman
try
to
catch
it
,
it
struck
him
on
the
nose
,
and
bounded
pleasantly
off
with
redoubled
violence
,
while
the
slim
gentleman
's
eyes
filled
with
water
,
and
his
form
writhed
with
anguish
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
thrown
straight
up
to
the
wicket
,
Dumkins
had
reached
it
before
the
ball
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
when
Dumkins
was
caught
out
,
and
Podder
stumped
out
,
All
-
Muggleton
had
notched
some
fifty
-
four
,
while
the
score
of
the
Dingley
Dellers
was
as
blank
as
their
faces
.
 
<EOS>
The
advantage
was
too
great
to
be
recovered
.
 
<EOS>
In
vain
did
the
eager
Luffey
,
and
the
enthusiastic
Struggles
,
do
all
that
skill
and
experience
could
suggest
,
to
regain
the
ground
Dingley
Dell
had
lost
in
the
contest
 
<EOS>
---
it
was
of
no
avail
;
and
in
an
early
period
of
the
winning
game
Dingley
Dell
gave
in
,
and
allowed
the
superior
prowess
of
All
-
Muggleton
.
   
<EOS>
The
stranger
,
meanwhile
,
had
been
eating
,
drinking
,
and
talking
,
without
cessation
.
 
<EOS>
At
every
good
stroke
he
expressed
his
satisfaction
and
approval
of
the
player
in
a
most
condescending
and
patronising
manner
,
which
could
not
fail
to
have
been
highly
gratifying
to
the
party
concerned
;
while
at
every
bad
attempt
at
a
catch
,
and
every
failure
to
stop
the
ball
,
he
launched
his
personal
displeasure
at
the
head
of
the
devoted
individual
in
such
denunciations
as
---
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
ah
!
---
stupid
"
---
"
Now
,
butter
-
fingers
"
 
---
"
Muff
"
---
"
Humbug
"
---
and
so
forth
---
ejaculations
which
seemed
to
establish
him
in
the
opinion
of
all
around
,
as
a
most
excellent
and
undeniable
judge
of
the
whole
art
and
mystery
of
the
noble
game
of
cricket
.
   
<EOS>
"
Capital

"
said
the
stranger
,
as
both
sides
crowded
into
the
tent
,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
game
.
   
<EOS>
"
You

inquired
Mr
Wardle
,
who

<EOS>
Here
the
stranger
buried
his
countenance
in
a
brown
jug
,
but
whether
to
hide
his
emotion
or
imbibe
its
contents
,
we
can
not
distinctly
affirm
.
 
<EOS>
We
only
know
that
he
paused
suddenly
,
drew
a
long
and
deep
breath
,
and
looked
anxiously
on
,
as
two
of
the
principal
members
of
the
Dingley
Dell
club
approached
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
about
to
partake
of
a
plain
dinner
at
the
Blue
Lion
,
Sir
;
we
hope
you
and
your
friends
will
join
us

<EOS>
"
Of
course

"
said
Mr
Wardle
,
"
among
our
friends
we
include
Mr

;
"
and
he
looked
towards
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jingle

said
that
versatile
gentleman
,
taking
the
hint
at
once
.
<EOS>
"

Alfred

"
   
"
I
shall
be

happy
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
shall
I
,
"
said
Mr
Alfred
Jingle
,
drawing
one
arm
through
Mr
Pickwick
's
,
and
another
through
Mr
Wardle
's
,
as
he
whispered
confidentially
in
the
ear
of
the
former
gentleman
:
---
   
<EOS>
"
Devilish
good
dinner

cold
,
but
capital

into

well

,
too
---
very
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
being
no
further
preliminaries
to
arrange
,
the
company
straggled
into
the
town
in
little
knots
of
twos
and
threes
;
and
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
were
all
seated
in
the
great
room
of
the
Blue
Lion
Inn
,
Muggleton
---
<EOS>
Mr
Dumkins
acting
as
chairman
,
and
Mr
Luffey
officiating
as
vice
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
vast
deal
of
talking
and
rattling
of
knives
and
forks
,
and
plates
;
a
great
running
about
of
three
ponderous
-
headed
waiters
,
and
a
rapid
disappearance
of
the
substantial
viands
on
the
table
;
to
each
and
every
of
which
item
of
confusion
,
the
facetious
Mr
Jingle
lent
the
aid
of
half
-
a
-
dozen
ordinary
men
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
When
everybody
had
eaten
as
much
as
possible
,
the
cloth
was
removed
,
bottles
,
glasses
,
and
dessert
were
placed
on
the
table
;
and
the
waiters
withdrew
to
"
clear
away
,
"
or
in
other
words
,
to
appropriate
to
their
own
private
use
and
emolument
whatever
remnants
of
the
eatables
and
drinkables
they
could
contrive
to
lay
their
hands
on
.
   
<EOS>
Amidst
the
general
hum
of
mirth
and
conversation
that
ensued
,
there
was
a
little
man
with
a
puffy
Say
-
nothing
-
to
-
me*-or
-
I'll
-
contradict
-
<EOS>
you
sort
of
countenance
,
who
remained
very
quiet
;
occasionally
looking
round
him
when
the
conversation
slackened
,
as
if
he
contemplated
putting
in
something
very
weighty
;
and
now
and
then
bursting
into
a
short
cough
of
inexpressible
grandeur
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
during
a
moment
of
comparative
silence
,
the
little
man
called
out
in
a
very
loud
,
solemn
voice
,
---
   
"
Mr
Luffey
!
"
   
<EOS>
Everybody
was
hushed
into
a
profound
stillness
as
the
individual
addressed
,
replied
---
   
"
Sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
address
a
few
words
to
you
,
Sir
,
if
you
will
entreat
the
gentlemen
to
fill
their
glasses
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jingle
uttered
a
patronising
"
Hear
,
hear
,
"
which
was
responded
to
by
the
remainder
of
the
company
;
and
the
glasses
having
been
filled
,
the
vice
-
president
assumed
an
air
of
wisdom
in
a
state
of
profound
attention
;
and
said
---
   
"
Mr
Staple
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
the
little
man
,
rising
,
"
I
wish
to
address
what
I
have
to
say
to
you
and
not
to

because
our

chairman
is
in
some
measure

I
may
say
in
a
great
degree

the
subject

I

suggested
Mr
Jingle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
to
state

"
said
the
little
man
,
"
I
thank
my
honourable
friend
,
if
he
will
allow
me
to
call
him
so
(
four

one
certainly
from
Mr

,
for
the
suggestion

<EOS>
Sir

I
am
a

<EOS>
I
can
not
lay
claim
to
the
honour
of
forming
an
item
in
the
population
of
Muggleton

nor
,
Sir

I
will
frankly
admit
,
do
I
covet
that
honour
:
<EOS>
and
I
will
tell
you
why
,
Sir

;
to
Muggleton
I
will
readily
concede
all
these
honours

distinctions
to
which
it
can
fairly
lay
claim
<EOS>
---
they
are
too
numerous
and
too
well
known
to
require
aid
or
recapitulation
from
me
.
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
while
we
remember
that
Muggleton
has
given
birth
to
a
Dumkins
and
a
Podder
,
let
us
never
forget
that
Dingley
Dell
can
boast
a
Luffey
and
a
Struggles
.
 
<EOS>
(
Vociferous
cheering
.
)
<EOS>
Let
me
not
be
considered
as
wishing
to
detract
from
the
merits
of
the
former
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
envy
them
the
luxury
of
their
own
feelings
on
this
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
(
Cheers

)
<EOS>
Every
gentleman
who
hears
me
,
is
probably
acquainted
with
the
reply
made
by
an
individual
,
who
 
---
to
use
an
ordinary
figure
of
speech
---
"
hung
out
"
in
a
tub
,
to
the
emperor
Alexander
:
---
"
if
I
were
not
Diogenes
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
would
be
Alexander
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
can
well
imagine
these
gentlemen
to
say
,
"
If
I
were
not
Dumkins
I
would
be
Luffey
;
if
I
were
not
Podder
I
would
be
Struggles

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
Enthusiasm

<EOS>
But
,
gentlemen
of
Muggleton
,
is
it
in
cricket
alone
that
your
fellow
-
townsmen
stand
pre
-
eminent
?
<EOS>
Have
you
never
heard
of
Dumkins
and
determination
?
<EOS>
Have
you
never
been
taught
to
associate
Podder
with
property
?
<EOS>
(
Great
applause

)
<EOS>
Have
you
never
,
when
struggling
for
your
rights
,
your
liberties
,
and
your
privileges
,
been
reduced
,
if
only
for
an
instant
,
to
misgiving
and
despair
?
 
<EOS>
And
when
you
have
been
thus
depressed
,
has
not
the
name
of
Dumkins
laid
afresh
within
your
breast
the
fire
which
had
just
gone
out
;
and
has
not
a
word
from
that
man
lighted
it
again
as
brightly
as
if
it
had
never
expired
?
 
<EOS>
(
Great
cheering

)
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
I
beg
to
surround
with
a
rich
halo
of
enthusiastic
cheering
the
united
names
of
"
Dumkins
and
Podder
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
Here
the
little
man
ceased
,
and
here
the
company
commenced
a
raising
of
voices
,
and
thumping
of
tables
,
which
lasted
with
little
intermission
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Other
toasts
were
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Luffey
and
Mr
Struggles
,
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Jingle
,
were
,
each
in
his
turn
,
the
subject
of
unqualified
eulogium
;
and
each
in
due
course
returned
thanks
for
the
honour
.
   
<EOS>
Enthusiastic
as
we
are
in
the
noble
cause
to
which
we
have
devoted
ourselves
<EOS>
,
we
should
have
felt
a
sensation
of
pride
which
we
can
not
express
,
and
a
consciousness
of
having
done
something
to
merit
immortality
of
which
we
are
now
deprived
,
could
we
have
laid
the
faintest
outline
on
these
addresses
before
our
ardent
readers
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
,
as
usual
,
took
a
great
mass
of
notes
,
which
would
no
doubt
have
afforded
most
useful
and
valuable
information
,
had
not
the
burning
eloquence
of
the
words
or
the
feverish
influence
of
the
wine
made
that
gentleman
's
hand
so
extremely
unsteady
,
as
to
render
his
writing
nearly
unintelligible
,
and
<EOS>
his
style
wholly
so
.
 
<EOS>
By
dint
of
patient
investigation
,
we
have
been
enabled
to
trace
some
characters
bearing
a
faint
resemblance
to
the
names
of
the
speakers
;
and
we
can
only
discern
an
entry
of
a
song
(
supposed
to
have
been
sung
by
Mr
Jingle
)
,
in
which
the
words
"
bowl
"
"
sparkling
"
"
ruby
"
"
bright
"
and
"
wine
"
are
frequently
repeated
at
short
intervals
.
 
<EOS>
We
fancy
,
too
,
that
we
can
discern
at
the
very
end
of
the
notes
,
some
indistinct
reference
to
"
broiled
bones
"
;
and
then
the
words
"
cold
"
"
without
"
occur
:
but
<EOS>
as
any
hypothesis
we
could
found
upon
them
must
necessarily
rest
upon
mere
conjecture
,
we
are
not
disposed
to
indulge
in
any
of
the
speculations
to
which
they
may
give
rise
.
   
<EOS>
We
will
therefore
return
to
Mr
Tupman
;
merely
adding
that
within
some
few
minutes
before
twelve
o'clock
that
night
,
the
convocation
of
worthies
of
Dingley
Dell
and
Muggleton
were
heard
to
sing
,
with
great
feeling
and
emphasis
,
the
beautiful
and
pathetic
national
air
of
     
<EOS>
"
We

n't

<EOS>
Strongly
illustrative
of
the
position
,
that
the
course
of
true
love
is
not
a
railway
 
<EOS>
The
quiet
seclusion
of
Dingley
Dell
,
the
presence
of
so
many
of
the
gentler
sex
,
and
the
solicitude
and
anxiety
they
evinced
in
his
behalf
,
were
all
favourable
to
the
growth
and
development
of
those
softer
feelings
which
nature
had
implanted
deep
in
the
bosom
of
Mr
Tracy
Tupman
,
and
which
now
appeared
destined
to
centre
in
one
lovely
object
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
were
pretty
,
their
manners
winning
,
their
dispositions
unexceptionable
;
but
there
was
a
dignity
in
the
air
,
a
touch
-
me
-
not
-
ishness
in
the
walk
,
a
majesty
in
the
eye
,
of
the
spinster
aunt
,
to
which
,
at
their
time
of
life
,
they
could
lay
no
claim
,
which
distinguished
her
from
any
female
on
whom
Mr
Tupman
had
ever
gazed
.
 
<EOS>
That
there
was
something
kindred
in
their
nature
,
something
congenial
in
their
souls
,
something
mysteriously
sympathetic
in
their
bosoms
,
was
evident
.
 
<EOS>
Her
name
was
the
first
that
rose
to
Mr
Tupman
's
lips
as
he
lay
wounded
on
the
grass
;
and
her
hysteric
laughter
was
the
first
sound
that
fell
upon
his
ear
when
he
was
supported
to
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
But
had
her
agitation
arisen
from
an
amiable
and
feminine
sensibility
which
would
have
been
equally
irrepressible
in
any
case
;
or
had
it
been
called
forth
by
a
more
ardent
and
passionate
feeling
,
which
he
,
of
all
men
living
,
could
alone
awaken
?
 
<EOS>
These
were
the
doubts
which
racked
his
brain
as
he
lay
extended
on
the
sofa
;
these
were
the
doubts
which
he
determined
should
be
at
once
and
for
ever
resolved
.
   
<EOS>
it
was
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Isabella
and
Emily
had
strolled
out
with
Mr
Trundle
;
the
deaf
old
lady
had
fallen
asleep
in
her
chair
;
the
snoring
of
the
fat
boy
,
penetrated
in
a
low
and
monotonous
sound
from
the
distant
kitchen
;
the
buxom
servants
were
lounging
at
the
side
door
,
enjoying
the
pleasantness
of
the
hour
,
and
the
delights
of
a
flirtation
,
on
first
principles
,
with
certain
unwieldy
animals
attached
to
the
farm
;
and
there
sat
the
interesting
pair
,
uncared
for
by
all
,
caring
for
none
,
and
dreaming
only
of
themselves
;
there
they
sat
,
in
short
,
like
a
pair
of
carefully
-
folded
kid
gloves
---
bound
up
in
each
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
forgotten
my
flowers
,
"
said
the
spinster
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Water
them
now
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
in
accents
of
persuasion
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
take
cold
in
the
evening
air
,
"
urged
the
spinster
aunt
affectionately
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
rising
;
"
it
will
do
me
good
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
accompany
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
lady
paused
to
adjust
the
sling
in
which
the
left
arm
of
the
youth
was
placed
,
and
taking
his
right
arm
led
him
to
the
garden
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
bower
at
the
farther
end
,
with
honeysuckle
,
jessamine
,
and
creeping
plants
---
one
of
those
sweet
retreats
which
humane
men
erect
for
the
accommodation
of
spiders
.
   
<EOS>
The
spinster
aunt
took
up
a
large
watering
-
pot
which
lay
in
one
corner
,
and
was
about
to
leave
the
arbour
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
detained
her
,
and
drew
her
to
a
seat
beside
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Wardle
!
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
The
spinster
aunt
trembled
,
till
some
pebbles
which
had
accidentally
found
their
way
into
the
large
watering
-
pot
shook
like
an
infant
's
rattle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Wardle
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
"
you
are
an
angel
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Tupman
!
"
exclaimed
Rachael
,
blushing
as
red
as
the
watering
-
pot
itself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
said
the
eloquent
Pickwickian
---
"
I
know
it
but
too
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
women
are
angels
,
they
say
,
"
murmured
the
lady
playfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
what
can
you
be
;
or
to
what
,
without
presumption
,
can
I
compare
you
?
"
replied
Mr
Tupman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
was
the
woman
ever
seen
who
resembled
you
?
 
<EOS>
Where
else
could
I
hope
to
find
so
rare
a
combination
of
excellence
and
beauty
?
 
<EOS>
Where
else
could
I
seek
to
---
 
Oh
!
"
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Tupman
paused
,
and
pressed
the
hand
which
clasped
the
handle
of
the
happy
watering
-
pot
.
   
<EOS>
The
lady
turned
aside
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Men
are
such
deceivers
,
"
she
softly
whispered
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
are
,
they
are
,
"
ejaculated
Mr
Tupman
;
"
but
not
all
men
.
<EOS>
There
lives
at
least
one
being
who
can
never
change
---
one
being
who
would
be
content
to
devote
his
whole
existence
to
your
happiness
---
who
lives
but
in
your
eyes
---
who
breathes
but
in
your
smiles
---
who
bears
the
heavy
burden
of
life
itself
only
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Could
such
an
individual
be
found
---
"
said
the
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
he
CAN
be
found
,
"
said
the
ardent
Mr
Tupman
,
interposing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
IS
found
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
here
,
Miss
Wardle
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
ere
<EOS>
the
lady
was
aware
of
his
intention
,
Mr
Tupman
had
sunk
upon
his
knees
at
her
feet
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Tupman
,
rise
,
"
said
Rachael
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
was
the
valorous
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Rachael
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
seized
her
passive
hand
,
and
the
watering
-
pot
fell
to
the
ground
as
he
pressed
it
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Rachael
!
<EOS>
say
you
love
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Tupman
,
"
said
the
spinster
aunt
,
with
averted
head
,
"
I
can
hardly
speak
the
words
;
but
<EOS>
---
but
---
you
are
not
wholly
indifferent
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
no
sooner
heard
this
avowal
,
than
he
proceeded
to
do
what
his
enthusiastic
emotions
prompted
,
and
what
,
for
aught
we
know
(
for
we
are
but
little
acquainted
with
such
matters
)
,
people
so
circumstanced
always
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
jumped
up
,
and
,
throwing
his
arm
round
the
neck
of
the
spinster
aunt
,
imprinted
upon
her
lips
numerous
kisses
,
which
after
a
due
show
of
struggling
and
resistance
,
she
received
so
passively
,
that
there
is
no
telling
how
many
more
Mr
Tupman
might
have
bestowed
,
if
the
lady
had
not
given
a
very
unaffected
start
,
and
exclaimed
in
an
affrighted
tone
---
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
,
we
are
observed
!
<EOS>
---
we
are
discovered
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
looked
round
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
fat
boy
,
perfectly
motionless
,
with
his
large
circular
eyes
staring
into
the
arbour
,
but
without
the
slightest
expression
on
his
face
that
the
most
expert
physiognomist
could
have
referred
to
astonishment
,
curiosity
,
or
any
other
known
passion
that
agitates
the
human
breast
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
gazed
on
the
fat
boy
,
and
the
fat
boy
stared
at
him
;
and
the
longer
Mr
Tupman
observed
the
utter
vacancy
of
the
fat
boy
's
countenance
,
the
more
convinced
he
became
that
he
either
did
not
know
,
or
did
not
understand
,
anything
that
had
been
going
forward
.
 
<EOS>
Under
this
impression
,
he
said
with
great
firmness
---
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
here
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Supper
's
ready
,
sir
,
"
was
the
prompt
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
just
come
here
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Tupman
,
with
a
piercing
look
.
   
<EOS>
"
Just
,
"
replied
the
fat
boy
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
looked
at
him
very
hard
again
;
but
there
was
not
a
wink
in
his
eye
,
or
a
curve
in
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
took
the
arm
of
the
spinster
aunt
,
and
walked
towards
the
house
;
the
fat
boy
followed
behind
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
knows
nothing
of
what
has
happened
,
"
he
whispered
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
said
the
spinster
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
sound
behind
them
,
as
of
an
imperfectly
suppressed
chuckle
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
turned
sharply
round
.
 
<EOS>
No
;
it
could
not
have
been
the
fat
boy
;
there
was
not
a
gleam
of
mirth
,
or
anything
but
feeding
in
his
whole
visage
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
must
have
been
fast
asleep
,
"
whispered
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
least
doubt
of
it
,
"
replied
the
spinster
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
They
both
laughed
heartily
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
,
Tupman
was
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
,
for
once
,
had
not
been
fast
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
awake
---
wide
awake
---
to
what
had
been
going
forward
.
   
<EOS>
The
supper
passed
off
without
any
attempt
at
a
general
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
lady
had
gone
to
bed
;
Isabella
Wardle
devoted
herself
exclusively
to
Mr
Trundle
;
the
spinster
's
attentions
were
reserved
for
Mr
Tupman
;
and
Emily
's
thoughts
appeared
to
be
engrossed
by
some
distant
object
---
<EOS>
possibly
they
were
with
the
absent
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
Eleven
---
twelve
---
one
o'clock
had
struck
,
and
the
gentlemen
had
not
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
Consternation
sat
on
every
face
.
 
<EOS>
Could
they
have
been
waylaid
and
robbed
?
 
<EOS>
Should
they
send
men
and
lanterns
in
every
direction
by
which
they
could
be
supposed
likely
to
have
travelled
home
?
<EOS>
or
should
they
---
 
Hark
!
<EOS>
there
they
were
.
 
<EOS>
What
could
have
made
them
so
late
?
 
<EOS>
A
strange
voice
,
too
!
 
<EOS>
To
whom
could
it
belong
?
 
<EOS>
They
rushed
into
the
kitchen
,
whither
the
truants
had
repaired
,
and
at
once
obtained
rather
more
than
a
glimmering
of
the
real
state
of
the
case
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
hat
cocked
completely
over
his
left
eye
,
was
leaning
against
the
dresser
,
shaking
his
head
from
side
to
side
,
and
producing
a
constant
succession
of
the
blandest
and
most
benevolent
smiles
without
being
moved
thereunto
by
any
discernible
cause
or
pretence
whatsoever
;
<EOS>
old
Mr
Wardle
,
with
a
highly
-
inflamed
countenance
,
was
grasping
the
hand
of
a
strange
gentleman
muttering
protestations
of
eternal
friendship
;
Mr
Winkle
,
supporting
himself
by
the
eight
-
day
clock
,
was
feebly
invoking
destruction
upon
the
head
of
any
member
of
the
family
who
should
suggest
the
propriety
of
his
retiring
for
the
night
;
and
Mr
Snodgrass
had
sunk
into
a
chair
,
with
an
expression
of
the
most
abject
and
hopeless
misery
that
the
human
mind
can
imagine
,
portrayed
in
every
lineament
of
his
expressive
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
is
anything
the
matter
?
"
inquired
the
three
ladies
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
the
matter
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
---
we
're
---
all
right
.
<EOS>
---
I
say
,
Wardle
,
we
're
all
right
,
ai
n't
we
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
,
"
replied
the
jolly
host
.
<EOS>
---
"
My
dears
,
here
's
my
friend
Mr
Jingle
---
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
friend
,
Mr
Jingle
,
come

pon
 
---
<EOS>
little
visit
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
anything
the
matter
with
Mr
Snodgrass
,
Sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Emily
,
with
great
anxiety
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
the
matter
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Cricket
dinner
---
glorious
party
---
capital
songs
---
old
port
---
claret
---
good
 
---
<EOS>
very
good

wine
,
ma'am

wine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
n't
the
wine
,
"
murmured
Mr
Snodgrass
,
in
a
broken
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
the
salmon
.
"
 
<EOS>
(
Somehow
or
other
,
it
never
is
the
wine
,
in
these
cases
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Had
n't
they
better
go
to
bed
,
ma'am
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Emma
.
 
<EOS>
"
Two
of
the
boys
will
carry
the
gentlemen
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
go
to
bed
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
firmly
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
living
boy
shall
carry
me
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
stoutly
;
and
he
went
on
smiling
as
before
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
"
<EOS>
gasped
Mr
Winkle
faintly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hurrah
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Mr
Pickwick
,
taking
off
his
hat
and
dashing
it
on
the
floor
,
and
insanely
casting
his
spectacles
into
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
humorous
feat
he
laughed
outright
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
's
---
have
---
"
nother
---
bottle
,
"
cried
Mr
Winkle
,
commencing
in
a
very
loud
key
,
and
ending
in
a
very
faint
one
.
 
<EOS>
His
head
dropped
upon
his
breast
;
and
,
muttering
his
invincible
determination
not
to
go
to
his
bed
,
and
a
sanguinary
regret
that
he
had
not
"
done
for
old
Tupman
"
in
the
morning
,
he
fell
fast
asleep
;
in
which
condition
he
was
borne
to
his
apartment
by
two
young
giants
under
the
personal
superintendence
of
the
fat
boy
,
to
whose
protecting
care
Mr
Snodgrass
shortly
afterwards
confided
his
own
person
,
Mr
Pickwick
accepted
the
proffered
arm
of
Mr
Tupman
and
quietly
disappeared
,
smiling
more
than
ever
;
and
Mr
Wardle
,
after
taking
as
affectionate
a
leave
of
the
whole
family
as
if
he
were
ordered
for
immediate
execution
,
consigned
to
Mr
Trundle
the
honour
of
conveying
him
upstairs
,
and
retired
,
with
a
very
futile
attempt
to
look
impressively
solemn
and
dignified
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
shocking
scene
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
spinster
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dis
-
gusting
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
both
the
young
ladies
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dreadful
---
dreadful
!
<EOS>
"
said
Jingle
,
looking
very
grave
:
he
was
about
a
bottle
and
a
half
ahead
of
any
of
his
companions
.
"
<EOS>
Horrid
spectacle
---
very
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
nice
man
!
<EOS>
"
whispered
the
spinster
aunt
to
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
looking
,
too
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Emily
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
decidedly
,
"
observed
the
spinster
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
thought
of
the
widow
at
Rochester
,
and
his
mind
was
troubled
.
 
<EOS>
The
succeeding
half
-
hour
's
conversation
was
not
of
a
nature
to
calm
his
perturbed
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
The
new
visitor
was
very
talkative
,
and
the
number
of
his
anecdotes
was
only
to
be
exceeded
by
the
extent
of
his
politeness
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
felt
that
as
Jingle
's
popularity
increased
,
he
(
Tupman
)
retired
further
into
the
shade
.
 
<EOS>
His
laughter
was
forced
---
his
merriment
feigned
;
and
when
at
last
he
laid
his
aching
temples
between
the
sheets
,
he
thought
,
with
horrid
delight
,
on
the
satisfaction
it
would
afford
him
to
have
Jingle
's
head
at
that
moment
between
the
feather
bed
and
the
mattress
.
   
<EOS>
The
indefatigable
stranger
rose
betimes
next
morning
,
and
,
although
his
companions
remained
in
bed
overpowered
with
the
dissipation
of
the
previous
night
,
exerted
himself
most
successfully
to
promote
the
hilarity
of
the
breakfast
-
table
.
 
<EOS>
So
successful
were
his
efforts
,
that
even
the
deaf
old
lady
insisted
on
having
one
or
two
of
his
best
jokes
retailed
through
the
trumpet
;
and
even
she
condescended
to
observe
to
the
spinster
aunt
,
that
"
He
"
(
meaning
Jingle
)
"
was
an
impudent
young
fellow
:
"
a
sentiment
in
which
all
her
relations
then
and
there
present
thoroughly
coincided
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
old
lady
's
habit
on
the
fine
summer
mornings
to
repair
to
the
arbour
in
which
Mr
Tupman
had
already
signalised
himself
,
in
form
and
manner
following
:
<EOS>
first
,
the
fat
boy
fetched
from
a
peg
behind
the
old
lady
's
bedroom
door
,
a
close
black
satin
bonnet
,
a
warm
cotton
shawl
,
and
a
thick
stick
with
a
capacious
handle
;
and
the
old
lady
,
having
put
on
the
bonnet
and
shawl
at
her
leisure
,
would
lean
one
hand
on
the
stick
and
the
other
on
the
fat
boy
's
shoulder
,
and
walk
leisurely
to
the
arbour
,
where
the
fat
boy
would
leave
her
to
enjoy
the
fresh
air
for
the
space
of
half
an
hour
;
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
he
would
return
and
reconduct
her
to
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
lady
was
very
precise
and
very
particular
;
and
as
this
ceremony
had
been
observed
for
three
successive
summers
without
the
slightest
deviation
from
the
accustomed
form
,
she
was
not
a
little
surprised
on
this
particular
morning
to
see
the
fat
boy
,
instead
of
leaving
the
arbour
,
walk
a
few
paces
out
of
it
,
look
carefully
round
him
in
every
direction
,
and
return
towards
her
with
great
stealth
and
an
air
of
the
most
profound
mystery
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
lady
was
timorous
---
most
old
ladies
are
---
and
her
first
impression
was
that
the
bloated
lad
was
about
to
do
her
some
grievous
bodily
harm
with
the
view
of
possessing
himself
of
her
loose
coin
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
have
cried
for
assistance
,
but
age
and
infirmity
had
long
ago
deprived
her
of
the
power
of
screaming
;
she
,
therefore
,
watched
his
motions
with
feelings
of
intense
horror
which
were
in
no
degree
diminished
by
his
coming
close
up
to
her
,
and
shouting
in
her
ear
in
an
agitated
,
and
as
it
seemed
to
her
,
a
threatening
tone
---
   
"
Missus
!
"
   
<EOS>
Now
it
so
happened
that
Mr
Jingle
was
walking
in
the
garden
close
to
the
arbour
at
that
moment
.
 
<EOS>
He
too
heard
the
shouts
of
"
Missus
,
"
and
stopped
to
hear
more
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
three
reasons
for
his
doing
so
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
he
was
idle
and
curious
;
secondly
,
he
was
by
no
means
scrupulous
;
thirdly
,
and
lastly
,
he
was
concealed
from
view
by
some
flowering
shrubs
.
 
<EOS>
So
there
he
stood
,
and
there
he
listened
.
   
<EOS>
"
Missus
!
"
shouted
the
fat
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Joe
,
"
said
the
trembling
old
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
have
been
a
good
mistress
to
you
,
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
invariably
been
treated
very
kindly
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
never
had
too
much
to
do
;
and
you
have
always
had
enough
to
eat
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
last
was
an
appeal
to
the
fat
boy
's
most
sensitive
feelings
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
touched
,
as
he
replied
emphatically
---
<EOS>
"
I
knows
I
has
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
what
can
you
want
to
do
now
?
"
said
the
old
lady
,
gaining
courage
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wants
to
make
your
flesh
creep
,
"
replied
the
boy
.
   
<EOS>
This
sounded
like
a
very
bloodthirsty
mode
of
showing
one
's
gratitude
;
and
as
the
old
lady
did
not
precisely
understand
the
process
by
which
such
a
result
was
to
be
attained
,
all
her
former
horrors
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
I
see
in
this
very
arbour
last
night
?
"
inquired
the
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
us
!
 
<EOS>
What
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
old
lady
,
alarmed
at
the
solemn
manner
of
the
corpulent
youth
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
strange
gentleman
---
him
as
had
his
arm
hurt
---
a
-
kissin
'
and
huggin
'
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
Who
,
Joe
?
 
<EOS>
None
of
the
servants
,
I
hope
.
"
<EOS>
"
Worser
than
that
,
"
roared
the
fat
boy
,
in
the
old
lady
's
ear
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
one
of
my
grandda'aters
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Worser
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Worse
than
that
,
Joe
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
old
lady
,
who
had
thought
this
the
extreme
limit
of
human
atrocity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
was
it
,
Joe
?
 
<EOS>
I
insist
upon
knowing
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
looked
cautiously
round
,
and
having
concluded
his
survey
,
shouted
in
the
old
lady
's
ear
---
   
"
Miss
Rachael
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
the
old
lady
,
in
a
shrill
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
louder
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Rachael
,
"
roared
the
fat
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
da'ater
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
train
of
nods
which
the
fat
boy
gave
by
way
of
assent
,
communicated
a
blanc
-
mange
like
motion
to
his
fat
cheeks
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
she
suffered
him
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
old
lady
.
<EOS>
A
grin
stole
over
the
fat
boy
's
features
as
he
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
her
a
-
kissin
'
of
him
agin
.
"
   
<EOS>
If
Mr
Jingle
,
from
his
place
of
concealment
,
could
have
beheld
the
expression
which
the
old
lady
's
face
assumed
at
this
communication
,
the
probability
is
that
a
sudden
burst
of
laughter
would
have
betrayed
his
close
vicinity
to
the
summer
-
house
.
<EOS>
He
listened
attentively
.
 
<EOS>
Fragments
of
angry
sentences
such
as
,
"
Without
my
permission
!
"
<EOS>
---
"
At
her
time
of
life
"
---
"
Miserable
old
"
ooman
like
me
"
---
<EOS>
"
Might
have
waited
till
I
was
dead
,
"
and
so
forth
,
reached
his
ears
;
and
then
he
heard
the
heels
of
the
fat
boy
's
boots
crunching
the
gravel
,
as
he
retired
and
left
the
old
lady
alone
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
remarkable
coincidence
perhaps
,
but
it
was
nevertheless
a
fact
,
that
Mr
Jingle
within
five
minutes
of
his
arrival
at
Manor
Farm
on
the
preceding
night
,
had
inwardly
resolved
to
lay
siege
to
the
heart
of
the
spinster
aunt
,
without
delay
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
observation
enough
to
see
,
that
his
off
-
hand
manner
was
by
no
means
disagreeable
to
the
fair
object
of
his
attack
;
and
he
had
more
than
a
strong
suspicion
that
she
possessed
that
most
desirable
of
all
requisites
,
a
small
independence
.
 
<EOS>
The
imperative
necessity
of
ousting
his
rival
by
some
means
or
other
,
flashed
quickly
upon
him
,
and
he
immediately
resolved
to
adopt
certain
proceedings
tending
to
that
end
and
object
,
without
a
moment
's
delay
.
<EOS>
Fielding
tells
us
that
man
is
fire
,
and
woman
tow
,
and
the
Prince
of
Darkness
sets
a
light
to
'em

<EOS>
Mr
Jingle
knew
that
young
men
,
to
spinster
aunts
,
are
as
lighted
gas
to
gunpowder
,
and
he
determined
to
essay
the
effect
of
an
explosion
without
loss
of
time
.
   
<EOS>
Full
of
reflections
upon
this
important
decision
,
he
crept
from
his
place
of
concealment
,
and
,
under
cover
of
the
shrubs
before
mentioned
,
approached
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Fortune
seemed
determined
to
favour
his
design
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
and
the
rest
of
the
gentlemen
left
the
garden
by
the
side
gate
just
as
he
obtained
a
view
of
it
;
and
the
young
ladies
,
he
knew
,
had
walked
out
alone
,
soon
after
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
The
coast
was
clear
.
   
<EOS>
The
breakfast
-
parlour
door
was
partially
open
.
 
<EOS>
He
peeped
in
.
<EOS>
The
spinster
aunt
was
knitting
.
 
<EOS>
He
coughed
;
she
looked
up
and
smiled
.
 
<EOS>
Hesitation
formed
no
part
of
Mr
Alfred
Jingle
's
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
laid
his
finger
on
his
lips
mysteriously
,
walked
in
,
and
closed
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Wardle
,
"
said
Mr
Jingle
,
with
affected
earnestness
,
"
forgive
intrusion
---
short
acquaintance
---
<EOS>
no
time
for
ceremony
---
all
discovered
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
spinster
aunt
,
rather
astonished
by
the
unexpected
apparition
and
somewhat
doubtful
of
Mr
Jingle
's
sanity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
said
Mr
Jingle
,
in
a
stage
-
whisper
---
"
Large
boy
---
dumpling
face
---
round
eyes
---
rascal
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
he
shook
his
head
expressively
,
and
the
spinster
aunt
trembled
with
agitation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
presume
you
allude
to
Joseph
,
Sir
?
"
said
the
lady
,
making
an
effort
to
appear
composed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
ma'am
<EOS>
---
damn
that
Joe
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
treacherous
dog
,
Joe
---
told
the
old
lady
---
old

furious

wild

raving

arbour

Tupman
---
kissing
and
hugging

all
that
sort
of
thing
---
eh
,
ma'am
---
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Jingle
,
"
said
the
spinster
aunt
,
"
if
you
come
here
,
Sir
,
to
insult
me
---
"
   
"
Not
at
all
---
by
no
means
,
"
replied
the
unabashed
Mr
Jingle
---
"
<EOS>
overheard
the
tale
---
came
to
warn
you
of
your
danger
---
<EOS>
tender
my
services

prevent
the
hubbub
.
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
---
think
it
an
insult
---
leave
the
room
"
---
and
he
turned
,
as
if
to
carry
the
threat
into
execution
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
SHALL
I
do
!
"
said
the
poor
spinster
,
bursting
into
tears
.
<EOS>
"
My
brother
will
be
furious
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
will
,
"
said
Mr
Jingle
pausing
---
"
outrageous
.
"
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr
Jingle
,
what
CAN
I
say
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
spinster
aunt
,
in
another
flood
of
despair
.
   
<EOS>
"
Say
he
dreamt
it
,
"
replied
Mr
Jingle
coolly
.
   
<EOS>
A
ray
of
comfort
darted
across
the
mind
of
the
spinster
aunt
at
this
suggestion
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jingle
perceived
it
,
and
followed
up
his
advantage
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pooh
,
pooh
!
---
nothing
more
easy
---
blackguard
boy
---
lovely
woman
---
fat
boy
horsewhipped
---
you
believed
---
end
of
the
matter
---
all
comfortable
.
"
   
<EOS>
Whether
the
probability
of
escaping
from
the
consequences
of
this
ill
-
timed
discovery
was
delightful
to
the
spinster
's
feelings
,
or
whether
the
hearing
herself
described
as
a
"
lovely
woman
"
<EOS>
softened
the
asperity
of
her
grief
,
we
know
not
.
 
<EOS>
She
blushed
slightly
,
and
cast
a
grateful
look
on
Mr
Jingle
.
   
<EOS>
That
insinuating
gentleman
sighed
deeply
,
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
spinster
aunt
's
face
for
a
couple
of
minutes
,
started
melodramatically
,
and
suddenly
withdrew
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
seem
unhappy
,
Mr
Jingle
,
"
said
the
lady
,
in
a
plaintive
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
show
my
gratitude
for
your
kind
interference
,
by
inquiring
into
the
cause
,
with
a
view
,
if
possible
,
to
its
removal
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Jingle
,
with
another
start
---
"
removal
!
<EOS>
remove
my
unhappiness
,
and
your
love
bestowed
upon
a
man
who
is
insensible
to
the
blessing
---
who
even
now
contemplates
a
design
upon
the
affections
of
the
niece
of
the
creature
<EOS>
who
---
but
no
;
he
is
my
friend
;
I
will
not
expose
his
vices
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Wardle
---
farewell
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
the
conclusion
of
this
address
,
the
most
consecutive
he
was
ever
known
to
utter
,
Mr
Jingle
applied
to
his
eyes
the
remnant
of
a
handkerchief
before
noticed
,
and
turned
towards
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
Mr
Jingle
!
"
said
the
spinster
aunt
emphatically
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
made
an
allusion
to
Mr
Tupman
---
explain
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
exclaimed
Jingle
,
with
a
professional
(
i.e.
,
theatrical
)
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
by
way
of
showing
that
he
had
no
desire
to
be
questioned
further
,
he
drew
a
chair
close
to
that
of
the
spinster
aunt
and
sat
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Jingle
,
"
said
the
aunt
,
"
I
entreat
<EOS>
---
I
implore
you
,
if
there
is
any
dreadful
mystery
connected
with
Mr
Tupman
,
reveal
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Can
I
,
"
said
Mr
Jingle
,
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
aunt
's
face
---
"
can
I
see
---
<EOS>
lovely
creature
---
sacrificed
at
the
shrine
---
heartless
avarice
!
"
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
be
struggling
with
various
conflicting
emotions
for
a
few
seconds
,
and
then
said
in
a
low
voice
---
   
<EOS>
"
Tupman
only
wants
your
money
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
wretch
!
"
exclaimed
the
spinster
,
with
energetic
indignation
.
<EOS>
(
Mr
Jingle
's
doubts
were
resolved
.
 
<EOS>
She
HAD
money
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
More
than
that
,
"
said
Jingle
---
"
loves
another
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Another
!
"
ejaculated
the
spinster
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
<EOS>
"
Short
girl
---
black
eyes
---
niece
Emily
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
if
there
was
one
individual
in
the
whole
world
,
of
whom
the
spinster
aunt
entertained
a
mortal
and
deep
-
rooted
jealousy
,
it
was
this
identical
niece
.
 
<EOS>
The
colour
rushed
over
her
face
and
neck
,
and
she
tossed
her
head
in
silence
with
an
air
of
ineffable
contempt
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
biting
her
thin
lips
,
and
bridling
up
,
she
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
It
ca
n't
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
believe
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Watch
'
em
,
"
said
Jingle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
said
the
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Watch
his
looks
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
His
whispers
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will

"
   
<EOS>
"
He
'll
sit
next
her
at
table

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
'll
flatter
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
'll
pay
her
every
possible
attention
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
he
'll
cut
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cut
ME
!
"
screamed
the
spinster
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
HE
cut
ME
;
will
he
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
trembled
with
rage
and
disappointment
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
convince
yourself
?
"
said
Jingle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
show
your
spirit
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
'll
not
have
him
afterwards
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
take
somebody
else
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jingle
fell
on
his
knees
,
remained
thereupon
for
five
minutes
thereafter
;
and
rose
the
accepted
lover
of
the
spinster
aunt
---
conditionally
upon
Mr
Tupman
's
perjury
being
made
clear
and
manifest
.
   
<EOS>
The
burden
of
proof
lay
with
Mr
Alfred
Jingle
;
and
he
produced
his
evidence
that
very
day
at
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
The
spinster
aunt
could
hardly
believe
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tracy
Tupman
was
established
at
Emily
's
side
,
ogling
,
whispering
,
and
smiling
,
in
opposition
to
Mr
Snodgrass
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
word
,
not
a
look
,
not
a
glance
,
did
he
bestow
upon
his
heart
's
pride
of
the
evening
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
Damn
that
boy
!
"
<EOS>
thought
old
Mr
Wardle
to
himself
.
<EOS>
---
He
had
heard
the
story
from
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
Damn
that
boy
!
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
been
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
imagination
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Traitor
!
<EOS>
"
thought
the
spinster
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
Mr
Jingle
was
not
deceiving
me
.
 
<EOS>
Ugh
!
<EOS>
how
I
hate
the
wretch
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
following
conversation
may
serve
to
explain
to
our
readers
this
apparently
unaccountable
alteration
of
deportment
on
the
part
of
Mr
Tracy
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
The
time
was
evening
;
the
scene
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
two
figures
walking
in
a
side
path
;
one
was
rather
short
and
stout
;
the

The

the
dialogue

<EOS>
"
How
did
I

it

he
inquired

Splendid

Of

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
,
"
replied
the
unsuspicious
Mr
Tupman
,
fervently
grasping
his
"
friend
's
"
hand
---
"
carry
my
best
love

say
how
hard
I
find
it
to
dissemble

say
anything
that

add
how
sensible
I
am
of
the
necessity
of
the
suggestion
she
made
to
me
,
through
you
,
this
morning

Say
I
applaud
her
wisdom

<EOS>
"
I
will
.
 
<EOS>
Anything
more
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
only
add
how
ardently
I
long
for
the
time
when
I
may
call
her
mine
,
and
all
dissimulation
may
be
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
certainly
.
 
<EOS>
Anything
more
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
friend
!
"
said
poor
Mr
Tupman
,
again
grasping
the
hand
of
his
companion
,
"
receive
my
warmest
thanks
for
your
disinterested
kindness
;
and
forgive
me
if
I
have
ever
,
even
in
thought

done
you
the
injustice
of
supposing
that
you
could
stand
in
my
way
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
can
I
ever
repay
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
of
it
,
"
replied
Mr
Jingle
.
 
<EOS>
He
stopped
short
,
as
if
suddenly
recollecting
something
,
and
said
---
"
By
the
bye
---
ca
n't
spare
ten
pounds
,
can
you
?
---
<EOS>
very
particular
purpose
---
pay
you
in
three
days
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
I
can
,
"
replied
Mr
Tupman
,
in
the
fulness
of
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
"
Three
days
,
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
three
days
---
all
over

---
no
more
difficulties
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
counted
the
money
into
his
companion
's
hand
,
and
he
dropped
it
piece
by
piece
into
his
pocket
,
as
they
walked
towards
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
Be
careful
,
"
said
Mr
Jingle
---
"
not
a
look
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
wink
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
syllable
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
whisper
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
your
attentions
to
the
niece
---
rather
rude
,
than
otherwise
,
to
the
aunt
---
only
way
of
deceiving
the
old
ones
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
care
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
aloud
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I'LL
take
care
,
"
said
Mr
Jingle
internally
;
and
they
entered
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
The
scene
of
that
afternoon
was
repeated
that
evening
,
and
on
the
three
afternoons
and
evenings
next
ensuing
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
fourth
,
the
host
was
in
high
spirits
,
for
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
no
ground
for
the
charge
against
Mr
Tupman
.
 
<EOS>
So
was
Mr
Tupman
,
for
Mr
Jingle
had
told
him
that
his
affair
would
soon
be
brought
to
a
crisis
.
 
<EOS>
So
was
Mr
Pickwick
,
for
he
was
seldom
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
So
was
not
Mr
Snodgrass
<EOS>
,
for
he
had
grown
jealous
of
Mr
Tupman
.
 
<EOS>
So
was
the
old
lady
,
for
she
had
been
winning
at
whist
.
 
<EOS>
So
were
Mr
Jingle
and
Miss
Wardle
,
for
reasons
of
sufficient
importance
in
this
eventful
history
to
be
narrated
in
another
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
9
.
<EOS>
A
discovery
and
a
chase
 
<EOS>
The
supper
was
ready
laid
,
the
chairs
were
drawn
round
the
table
,
bottles
,
jugs
,
and
glasses
were
arranged
upon
the
sideboard
,
and
everything
betokened
the
approach
of
the
most
convivial
period
in
the
whole
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
's
Rachael
?
"
said
Mr
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
and
Jingle
?
"
added
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
"
said
the
host
,
"
I
wonder
I
have
n't
missed
him
before
.
<EOS>
Why
,
I
do
n't
think
I
've
heard
his
voice
for
two
hours
at
least
.
<EOS>
Emily
,
my
dear
,
ring
the
bell
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
bell
was
rung
,
and
the
fat
boy
appeared
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
's
Miss
Rachael
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
could
n't
say
.
<EOS>
"
Where
's
Mr
Jingle
,
then
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
did
n't
know
.
<EOS>
Everybody
looked
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
late
---
past
eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
laughed
in
his
sleeve
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
loitering
somewhere
,
talking
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
capital
notion
that
---
funny
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
said
Wardle
,
after
a
short
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
'll
turn
up
presently
,
I
dare
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
wait
supper
for
anybody
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Excellent
rule
,
that
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
---
"
admirable
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
sit
down
,
"
said
the
host
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
and
down
they
sat
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
gigantic
round
of
cold
beef
on
the
table
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
was
supplied
with
a
plentiful
portion
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
raised
his
fork
to
his
lips
,
and
was
on
the
very
point
of
opening
his
mouth
for
the
reception
of
a
piece
of
beef
,
when
the
hum
of
many
voices
suddenly
arose
in
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
He
paused
,
and
laid
down
his
fork
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Wardle
paused
too
,
and
insensibly
released
his
hold
of
the
carving
-
knife
,
which
remained
inserted
in
the
beef
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
looked
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
Heavy
footsteps
were
heard
in
the
passage
;
the
parlour
door
was
suddenly
burst
open
;
and
the
man
who
had
cleaned
Mr
Pickwick
's
boots
on
his
first
arrival
,
rushed
into
the
room
,
followed
by
the
fat
boy
and
all
the
domestics
.
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
's
the
meaning
of
this
?
"
exclaimed
the
host
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
kitchen
chimney
ai
n't
a
-
fire
,
is
it
,
Emma
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
old
lady
.
<EOS>
"
Lor
,
grandma
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
"
screamed
both
the
young
ladies
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
roared
the
master
of
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
gasped
for
breath
,
and
faintly
ejaculated
---
   
<EOS>
"
They
ha
'
gone
,
mas'r
!
<EOS>
---
gone
right
clean
off
,
Sir
!
"
<EOS>
(
At
this
juncture
Mr
Tupman
was
observed
to
lay
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
to
turn
very
pale
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
gone
?
"
said
Mr
Wardle
fiercely
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mus'r
Jingle
and
Miss
Rachael
,
in
a
po'-chay
,
from
Blue
Lion
,
Muggleton
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
there
;
but
I
could
n't
stop
'em
;
<EOS>
so
I
run
off
to
tell
"
ee
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
paid
his
expenses
!
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
jumping
up
frantically
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
got
ten
pounds
of
mine
!
---
stop
him
!
<EOS>
---
he
's
swindled
me

<EOS>
---
I
wo
n't
bear
it
!
<EOS>
---
I
'll
have
justice
,
Pickwick
!
---
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
stand
it
!
"
<EOS>
and
with
sundry
incoherent
exclamations
of
the
like
nature
,
the
unhappy
gentleman
spun
round
and
round
the
apartment
,
in
a
transport
of
frenzy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
preserve
us
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mr
Pickwick
,
eyeing
the
extraordinary
gestures
of
his
friend
with
terrified
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
gone
mad
!
 
<EOS>
What
shall
we
do
?
"
<EOS>
"
Do
!
"
said
the
stout
old
host
,
who
regarded
only
the
last
words
of
the
sentence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Put
the
horse
in
the
gig
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
get
a
chaise
at
the
Lion
,
and
follow
'em
instantly
.
 
<EOS>
Where
?
<EOS>
"
---
he
exclaimed
,
as
the
man
ran
out
to
execute
the
commission
---
"
where
's
that
villain
,
Joe
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
I
am
!
<EOS>
but
I
hain't
a
willin

"
replied
a
voice
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
fat
boy
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
get
at
him
,
Pickwick
,
"
cried
Wardle
,
as
he
rushed
at
the
ill
-
starred
youth
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
bribed
by
that
scoundrel
,
Jingle
,
to
put
me
on
a
wrong
scent
,
by
telling
a
cock
-
and
-
bull
story
of
my
sister
and
your
friend
Tupman
!
"
<EOS>
(
Here
Mr
Tupman
sank
into
a
chair
.
)
<EOS>
"
Let
me
get
at
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
let
him
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
all
the
women
,
above
whose
exclamations
the
blubbering
of
the
fat
boy
was
distinctly
audible
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
be
held
!
"
cried
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Winkle
,
take
your
hands
off
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
let
me
go
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
beautiful
sight
,
in
that
moment
of
turmoil
and
confusion
,
to
behold
the
placid
and
philosophical
expression
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
face
,
albeit
somewhat
flushed
with
exertion
,
as
he
stood
with
his
arms
firmly
clasped
round
the
extensive
waist
of
their
corpulent
host
,
thus
restraining
the
impetuosity
of
his
passion
,
while
the
fat
boy
was
scratched
,
and
pulled
,
and
pushed
from
the
room
by
all
the
females
congregated
therein
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
sooner
released
his
hold
,
than
the
man
entered
to
announce
that
the
gig
was
ready
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
let
him
go
alone
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
the
females
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
'll
kill
somebody
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
with
him
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
good
fellow
,
Pickwick
,
"
said
the
host
,
grasping
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Emma
,
give
Mr
Pickwick
a
shawl
to
tie
round
his
neck
---
make
haste
.
 
<EOS>
Look
after
your
grandmother
,
girls
;
she
has
fainted
away
.
 
<EOS>
Now
then
,
are
you
ready
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
mouth
and
chin
having
been
hastily
enveloped
in
a
large
shawl
,
his
hat
having
been
put
on
his
head
,
and
his
greatcoat
thrown
over
his
arm
,
he
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
They
jumped
into
the
gig
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
her
her
head
,
Tom
,
"
cried
the
host
;
and
away
they
went
,
down
the
narrow
lanes
;
jolting
in
and
out
of
the
cart
-
ruts
,
and
bumping
up
against
the
hedges
on
either
side
,
as
if
they
would
go
to
pieces
every
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
much
are
they
ahead
?
<EOS>
"
shouted
Wardle
,
as
they
drove
up
to
the
door
of
the
Blue
Lion
,
round
which
a
little
crowd
had
collected
,
late
as
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
above
three
-
quarters
of
an
hour

was
everybody
's
reply

<EOS>
"
Chaise

and
-
four
directly

out

<EOS>
Put
up
the
gig
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now

cried
the
landlord
---
"
chaise
-
and
-
four
out
---
make
haste
---
look
alive
there
!
"
   
<EOS>
Away
ran
the
hostlers
and
the
boys
.
 
<EOS>
The
lanterns
glimmered
,
as
the
men
ran
to
and
fro
;
the
horses
"
hoofs
clattered
on
the
uneven
paving
of
the
yard
;
the
chaise
rumbled
as
it
was
drawn
out
of
the
coach
-
house
;
and
all
was
noise
and
bustle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
then
!
<EOS>
---
is
that
chaise
coming
out
to
-
night
?
"
cried
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Coming
down
the
yard
now
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
hostler
.
   
<EOS>
Out
came
the
chaise
---
in
went
the
horses
---
on
sprang
the
boys
 
---
in
got
the
travellers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mind
---
the
seven
-
mile
stage
in
less
than
half
an
hour
!
"
shouted
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Off
with
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
boys
applied
whip
and
spur
,
the
waiters
shouted
,
the
hostlers
cheered
,
and
away
they
went
,
fast
and
furiously
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty
situation
,
"
thought
Mr
Pickwick
,
when
he
had
had
a
moment
's
time
for
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pretty
situation
for
the
general
chairman
of
the
Pickwick
Club
.
 
<EOS>
Damp
chaise
---
strange
horses
---
fifteen
miles
an
hour
---
and
twelve
o'clock
at
night
!
"
   
<EOS>
For
the
first
three
or
four
miles
,
not
a
word
was
spoken
by
either
of
the
gentlemen
,
each
being
too
much
immersed
in
his
own
reflections
to
address
any
observations
to
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
had
gone
over
that
much
ground
,
however
,
and
the
horses
getting
thoroughly
warmed
began
to
do
their
work
in
really
good
style
,
Mr
Pickwick
became
too
much
exhilarated
with
the
rapidity
of
the
motion
,
to
remain
any
longer
perfectly
mute

"
We
're
sure
to
catch
them
,
I
think
,
"
said
he
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hope
so
,
"
replied
his
companion
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fine
night
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
up
at
the
moon
,
which
was
shining
brightly
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
worse
,
"
returned
Wardle
;
"
for
they
'll
have
had
all
the
advantage
of
the
moonlight
to
get
the
start
of
us
,
and
we
shall
lose
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
have
gone
down
in
another
hour
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
rather
unpleasant
going
at
this
rate
in
the
dark
,
wo
n't
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
it
will
,
"
replied
his
friend
dryly
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
temporary
excitement
began
to
sober
down
a
little
,
as
he
reflected
upon
the
inconveniences
and
dangers
of
the
expedition
in
which
he
had
so
thoughtlessly
embarked
.
<EOS>
He
was
roused
by
a
loud
shouting
of
the
post
-
boy
on
the
leader
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yo
-
yo
-
yo
-
yo
-
yoe
!
"
went
the
first
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yo
-
yo
-
yo
-
yoe
!
"
went
the
second
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yo
-
yo
-
yo
-
yoe
!
"
<EOS>
chimed
in
old
Wardle
himself
,
most
lustily
,
with
his
head
and
half
his
body
out
of
the
coach
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yo
-
yo
-
yo
-
yoe
!
"
shouted
Mr
Pickwick
,
taking
up
the
burden
of
the
cry
,
though
he
had
not
the
slightest
notion
of
its
meaning
or
object
.
 
<EOS>
And
amidst
the
yo
-
yoing
of
the
whole
four
,
the
chaise
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
gate
here
,
"
replied
old
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
hear
something
of
the
fugitives
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
lapse
of
five
minutes
,
consumed
in
incessant
knocking
and
shouting
,
an
old
man
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
emerged
from
the
turnpike
-
house
,
and
opened
the
gate
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
long
is
it
since
a
post
-
chaise
went
through
here
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
long
?
"
   
"
ah
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
do
n't
rightly
know
.
 
<EOS>
It
<EOS>
worn't
<EOS>
a
long
time
ago
,
nor
it
worn't
<EOS>
a
short
time
ago
---
just
between
the
two
,
perhaps
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Has
any
chaise
been
by
at
all
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
there
's
been
a
Shay
by
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
long
ago
,
my
friend
,
"
interposed
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
an
hour
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
dare
say
it
might
be
,
"
replied
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Or
two
hours
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
post
---
boy
on
the
wheeler
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
should
n't
wonder
if
it
was
,
"
returned
the
old
man
doubtfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
Drive
on
,
boys
,
"
cried
the
testy
old
gentleman
;
"
do
n't
waste
any
more
time
with
that
old
idiot
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Idiot
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
old
man
with
a
grin
,
as
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
road
with
the
gate
half
-
closed
,
watching
the
chaise
which
rapidly
diminished
in
the
increasing
distance
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
---
not
much
o
'
<EOS>
that
either
;
you
've
lost
ten
minutes
here
,
and
gone
away
as
wise
as
you
came
,
arter
all
.
 
<EOS>
If
every
man
on
the
line
as
has
a
guinea
give
him
,
earns
it
half
as
well
<EOS>
,
you
wo
n't
catch
t'other
shay
this
side
Mich'lmas
,
old
short
-
and
-
fat
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
another
prolonged
grin
,
the
old
man
closed
the
gate
,
re
-
entered
his
house
,
and
bolted
the
door
after
him
.
   
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
chaise
proceeded
,
without
any
slackening
of
pace
,
towards
the
conclusion
of
the
stage
.
 
<EOS>
The
moon
,
as
Wardle
had
foretold
,
was
rapidly
on
the
wane
;
large
tiers
of
dark
,
heavy
clouds
,
which
had
been
gradually
overspreading
the
sky
for
some
time
past
,
now
formed
one
black
mass
overhead
;
and
large
drops
of
rain
which
pattered
every
now
and
then
against
the
windows
of
the
chaise
,
seemed
to
warn
the
travellers
of
the
rapid
approach
of
a
stormy
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
wind
,
too
,
which
was
directly
against
them
,
swept
in
furious
gusts
down
the
narrow
road
,
and
howled
dismally
through
the
trees
which
skirted
the
pathway
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
drew
his
coat
closer
about
him
,
coiled
himself
more
snugly
up
into
the
corner
of
the
chaise
,
and
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
,
from
which
he
was
only
awakened
by
the
stopping
of
the
vehicle
,
the
sound
of
the
hostler
's
bell
,
and
a
loud
cry
of
"
Horses
on
directly
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
here
another
delay
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
The
boys
were
sleeping
with
such
mysterious
soundness
,
that
it
took
five
minutes
a
-
piece
to
wake
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
hostler
had
somehow
or
other
mislaid
the
key
of
the
stable
,
and
even
when
that
was
found
,
two
sleepy
helpers
put
the
wrong
harness
on
the
wrong
horses
,
and
the
whole
process
of
harnessing
had
to
be
gone
through
afresh
.
 
<EOS>
Had
Mr
Pickwick
been
alone
,
these
multiplied
obstacles
would
have
completely
put
an
end
to
the
pursuit
at
once
,
but
old
Wardle
was
not
to
be
so
easily
daunted
;
and
he
laid
about
him
with
such
hearty
good
-
will
,
cuffing
this
man
,
and
pushing
that
;
strapping
a
buckle
here
,
and
taking
in
a
link
there
,
that
the
chaise
was
ready
in
a
much
shorter
time
than
could
reasonably
have
been
expected
,
under
so
many
difficulties
.
   
<EOS>
They
resumed
their
journey
;
and
certainly
the
prospect
before
them
was
by
no
means
encouraging
.
 
<EOS>
The
stage
was
fifteen
miles
long
,
the
night
was
dark
,
the
wind
high
,
and
the
rain
pouring
in
torrents
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
make
any
great
way
against
such
obstacles
united
;
it
was
hard
upon
one
o'clock
already
;
and
nearly
two
hours
were
consumed
in
getting
to
the
end
of
the
stage
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
however
,
an
object
presented
itself
,
which
rekindled
their
hopes
,
and
reanimated
their
drooping
spirits
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
did
this
chaise
come
in
?
"
cried
old
Wardle
,
leaping
out
of
his
own
vehicle
,
and
pointing
to
one
covered
with
wet
mud
,
which
was
standing
in
the
yard
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
hostler
,
to
whom
the
question
was
addressed
.
<EOS>
"
Lady
and
gentleman
?
"
inquired
Wardle
,
almost
breathless
with
impatience
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tall
gentleman
---
dress
-
coat
---
long
legs
---
thin
body
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Elderly
lady
---
thin
face
---
rather
skinny
---
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
heavens
,
it
's
the
couple
,
Pickwick
,
"
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Would
have
been
here
before
,
"
said
the
hostler
,
"
but
they
broke
a
trace
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
them
!
"
said
Wardle
,
"
it
is
,
by
Jove
!
 
<EOS>
Chaise
-
and
-
four
instantly
!
 
<EOS>
We
shall
catch
them
yet
before
they
reach
the
next
stage
.
 
<EOS>
A
guinea
a
-
piece
<EOS>
,
boys
-
be
alive
there
---
<EOS>
bustle
about
<EOS>
---
there
's
good
fellows
.
"
   
<EOS>
And
with
such
admonitions
as
these
,
the
old
gentleman
ran
up
and
down
the
yard
,
and
bustled
to
and
fro
,
in
a
state
of
excitement
which
communicated
itself
to
Mr
Pickwick
also
;
and
under
the
influence
of
which
,
that
gentleman
got
himself
into
complicated
entanglements
with
harness
,
and
mixed
up
with
horses
and
wheels
of
chaises
,
in
the
most
surprising
manner
,
firmly
believing
that
by
so
doing
he
was
materially
forwarding
the
preparations
for
their
resuming
their
journey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jump
in
---
jump
in
!
"
<EOS>
cried
old
Wardle
,
climbing
into
the
chaise
,
pulling
up
the
steps
,
and
slamming
the
door
after
him
.
<EOS>
"
Come
along
!
 
<EOS>
Make
haste
!
"
<EOS>
And
before
Mr
Pickwick
knew
precisely
what
he
was
about
,
he
felt
himself
forced
in
at
the
other
door
,
by
one
pull
from
the
old
gentleman
and
one
push
from
the
hostler
;
and
off
they
were
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
we
are
moving
now
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
exultingly
.
<EOS>
They
were
indeed
,
as
was
sufficiently
testified
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
by
his
constant
collision
either
with
the
hard
wood
-
work
of
the
chaise
,
or
the
body
of
his
companion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
up
!
"
said
the
stout
old
Mr
Wardle
,
as
Mr
Pickwick
dived
head
foremost
into
his
capacious
waistcoat
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
did
feel
such
a
jolting
in
my
life
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
replied
his
companion
,
"
it
will
soon
be
over
.
<EOS>
Steady
,
steady
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
planted
himself
into
his
own
corner
,
as
firmly
as
he
could
;
and
on
whirled
the
chaise
faster
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
They
had
travelled
in
this
way
about
three
miles
,
when
Mr
Wardle
,
who
had
been
looking
out
of
the
Window
for
two
or
three
minutes
,
suddenly
drew
in
his
face
,
covered
with
splashes
,
and
exclaimed
in
breathless
eagerness
---
   
<EOS>
"
Here
they
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
thrust
his
head
out
of
his
window
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
:
there
was
a
chaise
-
and
-
four
,
a
short
distance
before
them
,
dashing
along
at
full
gallop
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
go
on
,
"
almost
shrieked
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Two
guineas
a
-
piece
,
boys
---
do
n't
let
'em
gain
on
us
---
keep
it
up
---
keep
it
up
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
horses
in
the
first
chaise
started
on
at
their
utmost
speed
;
and
those
in
Mr
Wardle
's
galloped
furiously
behind
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
his
head
,
"
exclaimed
the
choleric
old
man
;
"
damme
,
I
see
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
do
I
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
that
's
he
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
not
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
The
countenance
of
Mr
Jingle
,
completely
coated
with
mud
thrown
up
by
the
wheels
,
was
plainly
discernible
at
the
window
of
his
chaise
;
and
the
motion
of
his
arm
,
which
was
waving
violently
towards
the
postillions
,
denoted
that
he
was
encouraging
them
to
increased
exertion
.
   
<EOS>
The
interest
was
intense
.
 
<EOS>
Fields
,
trees
,
and
hedges
,
seemed
to
rush
past
them
with
the
velocity
of
a
whirlwind
,
so
rapid
was
the
pace
at
which
they
tore
along
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
close
by
the
side
of
the
first
chaise
.
 
<EOS>
Jingle
's
voice
could
be
plainly
heard
,
even
above
the
din
of
the
wheels
,
urging
on
the
boys
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Mr
Wardle
foamed
with
rage
and
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
He
roared
out
scoundrels
and
villains
by
the
dozen
,
clenched
his
fist
and
shook
it
expressively
at
the
object
of
his
indignation
;
but
Mr
Jingle
only
answered
with
a
contemptuous
smile
,
and
replied
to
his
menaces
by
a
shout
of
triumph
,
as
his
horses
,
answering
the
increased
application
of
whip
and
spur
,
broke
into
a
faster
gallop
,
and
left
the
pursuers
behind
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
had
just
drawn
in
his
head
,
and
Mr
Wardle
,
exhausted
with
shouting
,
had
done
the
same
,
when
a
tremendous
jolt
threw
them
forward
against
the
front
of
the
vehicle
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
sudden
bump
---
a
loud
crash
---
away
rolled
a
wheel
,
and
over
went
the
chaise
.
   
<EOS>
After
a
very
few
seconds
of
bewilderment
and
confusion
,
in
which
nothing
but
the
plunging
of
horses
,
and
breaking
of
glass
could
be
made
out
,
Mr
Pickwick
felt
himself
violently
pulled
out
from
among
the
ruins
of
the
chaise
;
and
as
soon
as
he
had
gained
his
feet
,
extricated
his
head
from
the
skirts
of
his
greatcoat
,
which
materially
impeded
the
usefulness
of
his
spectacles
,
the
full
disaster
of
the
case
met
his
view
.
   
<EOS>
Old
Mr
Wardle
without
a
hat
,
and
his
clothes
torn
in
several
places
,
stood
by
his
side
,
and
the
fragments
of
the
chaise
lay
scattered
at
their
feet
.
 
<EOS>
The
post
-
boys
,
who
had
succeeded
in
cutting
the
traces
,
were
standing
,
disfigured
with
mud
and
disordered
by
hard
riding
,
by
the
horses
"
heads
.
 
<EOS>
About
a
hundred
yards
in
advance
was
the
other
chaise
,
which
had
pulled
up
on
hearing
the
crash
.
 
<EOS>
The
postillions
,
each
with
a
broad
grin
convulsing
his
countenance
,
were
viewing
the
adverse
party
from
their
saddles
,
and
Mr
Jingle
was
contemplating
the
wreck
from
the
coach
window
,
with
evident
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
was
just
breaking
,
and
the
whole
scene
was
rendered
perfectly
visible
by
the
grey
light
of
the
morning
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
!
"
shouted
the
shameless
Jingle
,
"
anybody
damaged
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
elderly
gentlemen
---
no
light
weights
---
dangerous
work
---
<EOS>
very

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
rascal
,
"
roared
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
ha
!
"
replied
Jingle
;
and
then
he
added
,
with
a
knowing
wink
,
and
a
jerk
of
the
thumb
towards
the
interior
of
the
chaise
---
"
I
say
---
she
's
very
well
---
<EOS>
desires
her
compliments

begs
you

The
postillions
resumed
their
proper
attitudes
,
and
away
rattled
the
chaise
,
Mr
Jingle
fluttering
in
derision
a
white
handkerchief
from
the
coach
window
.
   
<EOS>
Nothing
in
the
whole
adventure
,
not
even
the
upset
,
had
disturbed
the
calm
and
equable
current
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
temper
.
 
<EOS>
The
villainy
,
however
,
which
could
first
borrow
money
of
his
faithful
follower
,
and
then
abbreviate
his
name
to
"
Tuppy
,
"
<EOS>
was
more
than
he
could
patiently
bear
.
 
<EOS>
He
drew
his
breath
hard
,
and
coloured
up
to
the
very
tips
of
his
spectacles
,
as
he
said
,
slowly
and
emphatically
---
   
<EOS>
"
If
ever
I
meet

man
again
,
I
'll

<EOS>
Yes

interrupted
Wardle
,
"
that
's
all
very
well
;
but
while
we
stand
talking
here
,
they
'll
get
their
licence
,
and
be
married
in
London
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
paused
,
bottled
up
his
vengeance
,
and
corked
it
down
.
<EOS>
"
How
far
is
it
to
the
next
stage
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Wardle
,
of
one
of
the
boys
.
   
<EOS>
"
Six

Wardle

<EOS>

No

replied
that
truly
great

So
sending
forward
one
of
the
boys
on
horseback
,
to
procure
a
fresh
chaise
and
horses
,
and
leaving
the
other
behind
to
take
care
of
the
broken
one
,
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Wardle
set
manfully
forward
on
the
walk
,
first
tying
their
shawls
round
their
necks
,
and
slouching
down
their
hats
to
escape
as
much
as
possible
from
the
deluge
of
rain
,
which
after
a
slight
cessation
had
again
begun
to
pour
heavily

Clearing
up
all
doubts
(
if
any
existed
)
of
the
disinterestedness
of
Mr
A
Jingle
's
character
 
<EOS>
There
are
in
London
several
old
inns
,
once
the
headquarters
of
celebrated
coaches
in
the
days
when
coaches
performed
their
journeys
in
a
graver
and
more
solemn
manner
than
they
do
in
these
times
;
but
which
have
now
degenerated
into
little
more
than
the
abiding
and
booking
-
places
of
country
wagons
.
 
<EOS>
The
reader
would
look
in
vain
for
any
of
these
ancient
hostelries
,
among
the
Golden
Crosses
and
Bull
and
Mouths
,
which
rear
their
stately
fronts
in
the
improved
streets
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
would
light
upon
any
of
these
old
places
,
he
must
direct
his
steps
to
the
obscurer
quarters
of
the
town
,
and
there
in
some
secluded
nooks
he
will
find
several
,
still
standing
with
a
kind
of
gloomy
sturdiness
,
amidst
the
modern
innovations
which
surround
them
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
Borough
especially
,
there
still
remain
some
half
-
dozen
old
inns
,
which
have
preserved
their
external
features
unchanged
,
and
which
have
escaped
alike
the
rage
for
public
improvement
and
the
encroachments
of
private
speculation
.
 
<EOS>
Great
,
rambling
queer
old
places
they
are
,
with
galleries
,
and
passages
,
and
staircases
,
wide
enough
and
antiquated
enough
to
furnish
materials
for
a
hundred
ghost
stories
,
supposing
we
should
ever
be
reduced
to
the
lamentable
necessity
of
inventing
any
,
and
that
the
world
should
exist
long
enough
to
exhaust
the
innumerable
veracious
legends
connected
with
old
London
Bridge
,
and
its
adjacent
neighbourhood
on
the
Surrey
side
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
yard
of
one
of
these
inns
---
of
no
less
celebrated
a
one
than
the
White
Hart
---
that
a
man
was
busily
employed
in
brushing
the
dirt
off
a
pair
of
boots
,
early
on
the
morning
succeeding
the
events
narrated
in
the
last
chapter
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
habited
in
a
coarse
,
striped
waistcoat
,
with
black
calico
sleeves
,
and
blue
glass
buttons
;
drab
breeches
and
leggings
.
 
<EOS>
A
bright
red
handkerchief
was
wound
in
a
very
loose
and
unstudied
style
<EOS>
round
his
neck
,
and
an
old
white
hat
was
carelessly
thrown
on
one
side
of
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
two
rows
of
boots
before
him
,
one
cleaned
and
the
other
dirty
,
and
at
every
addition
he
made
to
the
clean
row
,
he
paused
from
his
work
,
and
contemplated
its
results
with
evident
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
The
yard
presented
none
of
that
bustle
and
activity
which
are
the
usual
characteristics
of
a
large
coach
inn
.
 
<EOS>
Three
or
four
lumbering
wagons
,
each
with
a
pile
of
goods
beneath
its
ample
canopy
,
about
the
height
of
the
second
-
floor
window
of
an
ordinary
house
,
were
stowed
away
beneath
a
lofty
roof
which
extended
over
one
end
of
the
yard
;
and
another
,
which
was
probably
to
commence
its
journey
that
morning
,
was
drawn
out
into
the
open
space
.
 
<EOS>
A
double
tier
of
bedroom
galleries
,
with
old
Clumsy
balustrades
,
ran
round
two
sides
of
the
straggling
area
,
and
a
double
row
of
bells
to
correspond
,
sheltered
from
the
weather
by
a
little
sloping
roof
,
hung
over
the
door
leading
to
the
bar
and
coffee
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
Two
or
three
gigs
and
chaise
-
carts
were
wheeled
up
under
different
little
sheds
and
pent
-
houses
;
and
the
occasional
heavy
tread
of
a
cart
-
horse
,
or
rattling
of
a
chain
at
the
farther
end
of
the
yard
,
announced
to
anybody
who
cared
about
the
matter
,
that
the
stable
lay
in
that
direction
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
add
that
a
few
boys
in
smock
-
frocks
were
lying
asleep
on
heavy
packages
,
wool
-
packs
,
and
other
articles
that
were
scattered
about
on
heaps
of
straw
,
we
have
described
as
fully
as
need
be
the
general
appearance
of
the
yard
of
the
White
Hart
Inn
,
High
Street
,
Borough
,
on
the
particular
morning
in
question
.
   
<EOS>
A
loud
ringing
of
one
of
the
bells
was
followed
by
the
appearance
of
a
smart
chambermaid
in
the
upper
sleeping
gallery
,
who
,
after
tapping
at
one
of
the
doors
,
and
receiving
a
request
from
within
,
called
over
the
balustrades
---
"

"

replied
the
man
with
the
white

.
   
<EOS>

was
the

<EOS>
"

said
the

coaxingly
,
"

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well

the

<EOS>

"
   
<EOS>
Saying
which
,
the
man
in
the
white
hat
set
to
work
upon
a
top
-
boot
with
increased
assiduity
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
another
loud
ring
;
and
the
bustling
old
landlady
of
the
White
Hart
made
her
appearance
in
the
opposite
gallery
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam

cried
the
landlady
,
"
<EOS>
where

<EOS>

Sam

<EOS>
"
Vouldn't

gruffly

<EOS>
The
landlady
flung
a
pair
of
lady
's
shoes
into
the
yard
,
and
bustled
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Number

said
Sam
,
as
he
picked
up
the
shoes
,
and
taking
a
piece
of
chalk
from
his
pocket
,
made
a
memorandum
of
their
destination
on
the
soles
---

"

She

cried
the

was
still
leaning
over
the
railing
of
the
gallery
,

with

<EOS>
"
Vy
did

said
Sam
,
with
great
indignation
,
singling
out
the
boots
in
question
from
the
heap
before
him
.

Stimulated
by
this
inspiring
reflection
,
Mr
Samuel
brushed
away
with
such
hearty
good
-
will
,
that
in
a
few
minutes
the
boots
and
shoes
,
with
a
polish
which
would
have
struck
envy

soul

"

voice

in

rap

<EOS>
Sam
made
his

bow

stepped
into

gentleman
seated
at

Having

Mr

skipped
playfully
up
to

imprinted
a
chaste
kiss
upon

danced
out

"

Rum

said
Mr

,
as
he
walked
down

<EOS>
It
is
painful
to
reflect
upon

perfidy
of

and
we
will
not
,
therefore
,
pursue
the
thread
of
Mr
Jingle
's
meditations
,
as
he
wended
his
way
to
Doctors
"
Commons
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
sufficient
for

purpose
to
relate
,
that
escaping
the
snares
of
the
dragons
in
white
aprons
,
who
guard
the
entrance
to

,
he
reached
the
vicar

general
's
office
in
safety
and
having
procured
a
highly
flattering
address
on
parchment
,
from
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
to
his
"
trusty
and
well

beloved
Alfred
Jingle

Rachael

greeting
,
"
he
carefully
deposited
the
mystic
document
in
his
pocket
,
and
retraced
his
steps
in
triumph
to
the
Borough
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
yet
on
his
way
to
the
White
Hart
,
when
two
plump
gentleman
and
one
thin
one
entered
the
yard
,
and
looked
round
in
search
of
some
authorised
person
of
whom
they
could
make
a
few
inquiries
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Samuel
Weller
happened
to
be
at
that
moment
engaged
in
burnishing
a
pair
of
painted
tops
,
the
personal
property
of
a
farmer
who
was
refreshing
himself
with
a
slight
lunch
of
two
or
three
pounds
of
cold
beef
and
a
pot
or
two
of
porter
,
after
the
fatigues
of
the
Borough
market
;
and
to
him
the
thin
gentleman
straightway
advanced
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
friend
,
"
said
the
thin
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
one

"
thought
Sam
,
"
or
you

be
so
wery
fond
<EOS>
o

<EOS>
me
all
at
once

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
But
he
only
said
---
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
friend
,
"
said
the
thin
gentleman
,
with
a
conciliatory
hem
---
"
<EOS>
have
you
got
many
people
stopping
here
now
?
 
<EOS>
Pretty
busy
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
"
   
Sam
stole
a
look
at
the
inquirer
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
little
high
-
dried
man
,
with
a
dark
squeezed
-
up
face
,
and
small
,
restless
,
black
eyes
,
that
kept
winking
and
twinkling
on
each
side
of
his
little
inquisitive
nose
,
as
if
they
were
playing
a
perpetual
game
of
peep
-
bo
with
that
feature
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
all
in
black
,
with
boots
as
shiny
as
his
eyes
,
a
low
white
neckcloth
,
and
a
clean
shirt
with
a
frill
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
gold
watch
-
chain
,
and
seals
,
depended
from
his
fob
.
<EOS>
He
carried
his
black
kid
gloves
IN
his
hands
,
and
not
ON
them
;
and
as
he
spoke
,
thrust
his
wrists
beneath
his
coat
tails
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
in
the
habit
of
propounding
some
regular
posers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty
busy
,
eh
?
"
said
the
little
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
wery
<EOS>
well
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Sam
,
"
we
sha
n't
be
bankrupts
,
and
we
sha
n't
make
our
fort'ns
.
 
<EOS>
We
eats
our
biled
mutton
without

,
and
do

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
the
little
man
,
"
you
're
a
wag
,
ai
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
eldest
brother
was
troubled
with
that
complaint
,
"
said
Sam
;
"
it
may
be
catching
---
I
used
to
sleep
with
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
curious
old
house
of
yours
,
"
said
the
little
man
,
looking
round
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
'd
sent
word
you
was
a
-
coming
,
we
'd
ha
'
had
it
repaired
;
"
replied
the
imperturbable
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
The
little
man
seemed
rather
baffled
by
these
several
repulses
,
and
a
short
consultation
took
place
between
him
and
the
two
plump
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
At
its
conclusion
,
the
little
man
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
from
an
oblong
silver
box
,
and
was
apparently
on
the
point
of
renewing
the
conversation
,
when
one
of
the
plump
gentlemen
,
who
in
addition
to
a
benevolent
countenance
,
possessed
a
pair
of
spectacles
,
and
a
pair
of
black
gaiters
,
interfered
---
   
<EOS>
"
The
fact
of
the
matter
is
,
"
said
the
benevolent
gentleman
,
"
that
my
friend
here
(
pointing
to
the
other
plump
gentleman
)
will
give
you
half
a
guinea
,
if
you
'll
answer
one
or
two
---
"
   
"
Now
,
my
dear
sir
---
my
dear
Sir
,
"
said
<EOS>
the
little
man
,
"
pray
,
allow
me
---
my
dear
Sir
,
the
very
first
principle
to
be
observed
in
these
cases
,
<EOS>
is
this
:
if
you
place
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
a
professional
man
,
you
must
in
no
way
interfere
in
the
progress
of
the
business
;
you
must
repose
implicit
confidence
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
Really
,
Mr
---
<EOS>
"
He
turned
to
the
other
plump
gentleman
,
and
said
,
"
I
forget
your
friend
's
name
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pickwick
,
"
said
Mr
Wardle
,
for
it
was
no
other
than
that
jolly
personage
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Pickwick
---
really
Mr
Pickwick
,
my
dear
Sir
,
excuse
me
---
I
shall
be
happy
to
receive
any
private
suggestions
of
yours
,
as
AMICUS
CURIAE
,
but
you
must
see
the
impropriety
of
your
interfering
with
my
conduct
in
this
case
,
with
such
an
AD
CAPTANDUM
argument
as
the
offer
of
half
a
guinea
.
 
<EOS>
Really
,
my
dear
Sir
,
really
;
"
and
the
little
man
took
an
argumentative
pinch
of
snuff
,
and
looked
very
profound
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
only
wish
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
was
to
bring
this
very
unpleasant
matter
to
as
speedy
a
close
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
---
quite
right

"
said
the
little
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
which
view
,
"
continued
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
I
made
use
of
the
argument
which
my
experience
of
men
has
taught
me
is
the
most
likely
to
succeed
in
any
case
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay

ay

"
said
the
little
man
,
"
very
good

very
good

indeed

but
you
should
have
suggested
it
to
me

<EOS>
My
dear
sir
,
I
'm
quite
certain
you
can
not
be
ignorant
of
the
extent
of
confidence
which
must
be
placed
in
professional
men
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
authority
can
be
necessary
on
such
a
point
,
my
dear
sir
,
let
me
refer
you
to
the
well
-
known
case
in
Barnwell
and
---
"
   
"
Never
mind
George
Barnwell
,
"
interrupted
Sam
,
who
had
remained
a
wondering
listener
during
this
short
colloquy
;
"
everybody
knows
what
sort
of
a
case
his
was
,
tho
<EOS>
'
it
's
always
been
my
opinion
,
mind
you
,
that
the
young

deserved
scragging
a
precious

more
than
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
Hows'ever
<EOS>
,
that

neither
here

there

<EOS>
You
want
me
to
accept
of
half
a

<EOS>
Wery

no
fairer
than
that
,
can
I
,
sir

"
 
<EOS>
(
Mr
Pickwick
smiled
.
)
<EOS>
Then
the
next
question
is
,
what
the
devil
do
you
want
with
me
,
as
the
man
said
,
wen
he

the
ghost

Mr

interposed
the
busy
little

<EOS>
Mr
Wardle
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
was
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
want
to
know

"
said
the
little
man
solemnly
;
"
and
we
ask
the
question
of
you

in
order
that
we
may
not
awaken
apprehensions

we

<EOS>
"
Who
there

house

<EOS>
said
Sam
,
in
whose
mind
the
inmates
were
always
represented
by
that
particular
article
of
their
costume
,
which
came
under
his
immediate
superintendence
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
vooden

six

there

suddenly

hastily
inquired
Wardle

who
,
together
with
Mr

had
been
lost

bewilderment

He
drew
from
his
pocket
a
red
silk
purse
,
and
looked
very
hard
at
Sam
as
he
drew
out
a
sovereign
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
grinned
expressively
.
   
<EOS>
"
Show
us
into
the
room
at
once
,
without
announcing
us
,
"
said
the
little
man
,
"
and
it
's
yours
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sam
threw
the
painted
tops
into
a
corner
,
and
led
the
way
through
a
dark
passage
,
and
up
a
wide
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
He
paused
at
the
end
of
a
second
passage
,
and
held
out
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
it
is
,
"
whispered
the
attorney
,
as
he
deposited
the
money
on
the
hand
of
their
guide
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
stepped
forward
for
a
few
paces
,
followed
by
the
two
friends
and
their
legal
adviser
.
 
<EOS>
He
stopped
at
a
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
this
the
room
?
"
<EOS>
murmured
the
little
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
nodded
assent
.
   
<EOS>
Old
Wardle
opened
the
door
;
and
the
whole
three
walked
into
the
room
just
as
Mr
Jingle
,
who
had
that
moment
returned
,
had
produced
the
licence
to
the
spinster
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
The
spinster
uttered
a
loud
shriek
,
and
throwing
herself
into
a
chair
,
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jingle
crumpled
up
the
licence
,
and
thrust
it
into
his
coat
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
The
unwelcome
visitors
advanced
into
the
middle
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
You
---
you
are
a
nice
rascal
,
arn't
you
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Wardle
,
breathless
with
passion
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Sir
,
my
dear
sir

said
the
little
man
,
laying
his
hat
on
the
table
,
"

How

said
the
old
man

<EOS>
Ay

said
the
little
gentleman
,
"
you

<EOS>
How

<EOS>
---
eh

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
the
devil
are
you

"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Jingle
,
in
so
fierce
a
tone
,
that
the
little
gentleman
involuntarily
fell
back
a
step
or
two
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
is
he
,
you
scoundrel
,
"
interposed
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
my
lawyer
,
Mr
Perker
,
of
Gray
's
Inn

<EOS>
Perker

<EOS>
And

"
continued
Mr
Wardle
,
turning
abruptly
round
to
his
sister

"
you
,
Rachael

at
a
time
of
life

you
ought

know
better

what
do
you
mean

running
away
with
a
vagabond

disgracing
your

making
yourself
miserable

Get

Call

"
<EOS>
"
Cert'nly
,
Sir

"
replied
Sam
,
who
had
answered
Wardle
's
violent
ringing
of
the
bell
with
a
degree
of
celerity
which
must
have
appeared
marvellous
to
anybody
who
did
n't
know
that
his
eye
had
been
applied
to
the
outside
of
the
keyhole
during
the
whole
interview
.
   
<EOS>
"
Get
on
your
bonnet
,
"
repeated
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
nothing
of
the

said
Jingle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave

<EOS>
"
More

ejaculated
Wardle
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
More
than
one

and
-
forty
!
"
   
"
<EOS>
I
ai
n't

"
said
the
spinster
aunt
,
her
indignation
getting
the
better
of
her
determination
to
faint
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
,
"
replied
Wardle
;
"
you
're
fifty
if
you
're
an
hour
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
the
spinster
aunt
uttered
a
loud
shriek
,
and
became
senseless
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
glass
of
water
,
"
said
the
humane
Mr
Pickwick
,
summoning
the
landlady
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
glass
of
water

<EOS>
"
said
the
passionate
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bring
a
bucket

throw
it
all
over

it
'll
do
her

it

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ugh

<EOS>
ejaculated
the
kind

hearted
landlady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor

<EOS>
And
with
sundry
ejaculations
of

etc
.
 
<EOS>
etc
.
<EOS>
,
the
landlady
,
assisted
by
a
chambermaid
,
proceeded
to
vinegar
the
forehead
,
beat
the
hands
,
titillate
the
nose
,
and
unlace
the
stays
of
the
spinster
aunt
,
and
to
administer
such
other
restoratives
as
are
usually
applied
by
compassionate
females
to
ladies
who
are
endeavouring
to
ferment
themselves
into
hysterics
.
   
<EOS>
"
Coach
is
ready
,
Sir
,
"
said
Sam
,
appearing
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
along

"
cried
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
carry
her
downstairs
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
proposition
,
the
hysterics
came
on
with
redoubled
violence
.
<EOS>
The
landlady
was
about
to
enter
a
very
violent
protest
against
this
proceeding
,
and
had
already
given
vent
to
an
indignant
inquiry
whether
Mr
Wardle
considered
himself
a
lord
of
the
creation
,
when
Mr
Jingle
interposed
---
   
"
Boots

said
he
,
"
get
me
an
officer

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stay

said
little
Mr

<EOS>
"
Consider

"
   
<EOS>
"
I

Jingle

"
She

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
WON'T

murmured
the
spinster
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
DON'T

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
Here
there
was
a
frightful
relapse
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Sir
,
"
said
the
little
man
,
in
a
low
tone
,
taking
Mr
Wardle
and
Mr
Pickwick
apart
---
<EOS>
"
my
dear
Sir
,
we
're
in
a
very
awkward
situation
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
distressing
case
---
very
<EOS>
;
I
never
knew
one
more
so
;
but
really
,
my
dear
sir
,
really
we
have
no
power
to
control
this
lady
's
actions
.
 
<EOS>
I
warned
you
before
we
came
,
my
dear
sir
,
that
there
was
nothing
to
look
to
but
a
compromise
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
short
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
kind
of
compromise
would
you
recommend
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
Sir
,
our
friend
's
in
an
unpleasant
position
---
very
much
so
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
be
content
to
suffer
some
pecuniary
loss
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
suffer
any
,
rather
than
submit
to
this
disgrace
,
and
let
her
,
fool
as
she
is
,
be
made
miserable
for
life
,
"
said
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
rather
think
it
can
be
done
,
"
said
the
bustling
little
man
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Jingle
,
will
you
step
with
us
into
the
next
room
for
a
moment

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jingle
assented
,
and
the
quartette
walked
into
an
empty
apartment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
sir
,
"
said
the
little
man
,
as
he
carefully
closed
the
door
,
"
is
there
no
way
of
accommodating
this
matter
---
<EOS>
step
this
way
,
sir
,
for
a
moment

into
this
window
,
Sir

where
we
can
be
alone

there

there

sit
down

<EOS>
Now
,
my

Sir

between
you

I

we
know
very
well
,
my
dear
Sir

that
you
have
run
off
with
this
lady
for
the
sake
of
her
money
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
frown
,
Sir
,
do
n't
frown
;
I
say
,
between
you
and
I
<EOS>
,
WE
know
it

<EOS>
We
are
both
men

WE

very
well

our

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jingle
's
face
gradually
relaxed
;
and
something
distantly
resembling
a
wink
quivered
for
an
instant
in
his
left
eye
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
very
good
,
"
said
the
little
man
,
observing
the
impression
he
had
made
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
the
fact
is
,
that
beyond
a
few
hundreds
,
the
lady
has
little
or
nothing
till
the
death
of
her
mother
---
fine
old
lady
,
my
dear
Sir

"
   
<EOS>
"
OLD

"
said
Mr
Jingle
briefly
but
emphatically
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
"
said
the
attorney
,
with
a
slight
cough
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
my
dear
Sir
,
she
is
rather
old

<EOS>
She
comes
of
an
old
family
though
,
my
dear
Sir
;
old
in
every
sense
of
the
word
.
 
<EOS>
The
founder
of
that
family
came
into
Kent
when
Julius
Caesar
invaded
Britain
;
---
only
one
member
of
it
,
since

who
has
n't
lived

eighty

five

he
was
beheaded

one
of
the
Henrys

The

<EOS>
The
little
man
paused
,
and
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well

cried
Mr
Jingle

<EOS>
"
Well

again

Not

Mr

sullenly
nodded
assent

The

Bye

If
any
dispassionate
spectator
could
have
beheld
the
countenance
of
the
illustrious
man
,
whose
name
forms
the
leading
feature
of
the
title
of
this
work
,
during
the
latter
part
of
this
conversation
,
he
would
have
been
almost
induced
to
wonder
that
the
indignant
fire
which
flashed
from
his
eyes
did
not
melt
the
glasses
of
his
spectacles
---
so
majestic
was
his
wrath
.
 
<EOS>
His
nostrils
dilated
,
and
his
fists
clenched
involuntarily
,
as
he
heard
himself
addressed
by
the
villain
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
restrained
himself
again
---
he
did
not
pulverise
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
,
"
continued
the
hardened
traitor
,
tossing
the
licence
at
Mr
Pickwick
's
feet
;
"

the
name
altered
---
take
home
the
lady
 
---

for

<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
a
philosopher
,
but
philosophers
are
only
men
in
armour
,
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
shaft
had
reached
him
,
penetrated
through
his
philosophical
harness
,
to
his
very
heart
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
frenzy
of
his
rage
,
he
hurled
the
inkstand
madly
forward
,
and
followed
it
up
himself
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Jingle
had
disappeared
,
and
he
found
himself
caught
in
the
arms
of
Sam
.

<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
mind
,
like
those
of
all
truly
great
men
,
was
open
to
conviction
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
quick
and
powerful
reasoner
;
and
a
moment
's
reflection
sufficed
to
remind
him
of
the
impotency
of
his
rage
.
 
<EOS>
It
subsided
as
quickly
as
it
had
been
roused
.
<EOS>
He
panted
for
breath
,
and
looked
benignantly
round
upon
his
friends
.
   
<EOS>
Shall
we
tell
the
lamentations
that
ensued
when
Miss
Wardle
found
herself
deserted
by
the
faithless
Jingle
?
 
<EOS>
Shall
we
extract
Mr
Pickwick
's
masterly
description
of
that
heartrending
scene
?
<EOS>
His
note
-
book
,
blotted
with
the
tears
of
sympathising
humanity
,
lies
open
before
us
;
one
word
,
and
it
is
in
the

no

we
will
be
resolute
!
 
<EOS>
We
will
not
wring
the
public
bosom
,
with
the
delineation
of
such
suffering
!
   
<EOS>
Slowly
and
sadly
did
the
two
friends
and
the
deserted
lady
return
next
day
in
the
Muggleton
heavy
coach
.
 
<EOS>
Dimly
<EOS>
and
darkly
had
the
sombre
shadows
of
a
summer
's
night
fallen
upon
all
around
,
when
they
again
reached
Dingley
Dell

and
stood
within

<EOS>
Involving
another
journey
,
and
an
antiquarian
discovery
;
recording
Mr
Pickwick
's
determination
to
be
present
at
an
election
;
and
containing
a
manuscript
of
the
old
clergyman
's
 
A
night
of
quiet
and
repose
in
the
profound
silence
of
Dingley
Dell
,
and
an
hour
's
breathing
of
its
fresh
and
fragrant
air
on
the
ensuing
morning
,
completely
recovered
Mr
Pickwick
from
the
effects
of
his
late
fatigue
of
body
and
anxiety
of
mind
.
<EOS>
That
illustrious
man
had
been
separated
from
his
friends
and
fol
lowers
for
two
whole
days
;
and
it
was
with
a
degree
of
pleasure
and
delight
,
which
no
common
imagination
can
adequately
conceive
,
that
he
stepped
forward
to
greet
Mr
Winkle
and
Mr
Snodgrass
,
as
he
encountered
those
gentlemen
on
his
return
from
his
early
walk
.
 
<EOS>
The
pleasure
was
mutual
;
for
who
could
ever
gaze
on
Mr
Pickwick
's
beaming
face
without
experiencing
the
sensation
?
 
<EOS>
But
still
a
cloud
seemed
to
hang
over
his
companions
which
that
great
man
could
not
but
be
sensible
of
,
and
was
wholly
at
a
loss
to
account
for
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
mysterious
air
about
them
both
,
as
unusual
as
it
was
alarming
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
when
he
had
grasped
his
followers
by
the
hand
,
and
exchanged
warm
salutations
of
welcome
---
<EOS>
"
how
is
Tupman
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
,
to
whom
the
question
was
more
peculiarly
addressed
,
made
no
reply
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
away
his
head
,
and
appeared
absorbed
in
melancholy
reflection
.
   
<EOS>
"
Snodgrass
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
earnestly
,
"
how
is
our
friend
---
he
is
not
ill
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Mr
Snodgrass
;
and
a
tear
trembled
on
his
sentimental
eyelid
,
like
a
rain
-
drop
on
a
window
-
frame-'no
;
he
is
not
ill
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
stopped
,
and
gazed
on
each
of
his
friends
in
turn
.
   
<EOS>
"
Winkle
---
Snodgrass
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
what
does
this
mean
?
 
<EOS>
Where
is
our
friend

<EOS>
What
has
happened
?
 
<EOS>
Speak

<EOS>
I
conjure
<EOS>
,
I
entreat
---
<EOS>
nay
,
I
command
you
,
speak

"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
solemnity
---
a
dignity
---
in
Mr
Pickwick
's
manner
,
not
to
be
withstood
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
gone
,
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gone
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gone
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Gone

"
repeated
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where

"
ejaculated
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
can
only
guess
,
from
that
communication
,
"
replied
Mr
Snodgrass
,
taking
a
letter
from
his
pocket
,
and
placing
it
in
his
friend
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yesterday
morning
,
when
a
letter
was
received
from
Mr
Wardle
,
stating
that
you
would
be
home
with
his
sister
at
night
,
the
melancholy
which
had
hung
over
our
friend
during
the
whole
of
the
previous
day
,
was
observed
to
increase
.
 
<EOS>
He
shortly
afterwards
disappeared
:
he
was
missing
during
the
whole
day
,
and
in
the
evening
this
letter
was
brought
by
the
hostler
from
the
Crown
,
at
Muggleton
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
left
in
his
charge
in
the
morning
,
with
a
strict
injunction
that
it
should
not
be
delivered
until
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
opened
the
epistle
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
his
friend
's
hand
-
writing
,
and
these
were
its
contents
:
---
   
<EOS>
"
MY
DEAR
PICKWICK

YOU

dear

are
placed
far
beyond
the
reach
of
many
mortal
frailties
and
weaknesses
which
ordinary
people
can
not
overcome
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
what
it
is
,
at
one
blow
,
to
be
deserted
by
a
lovely
and
fascinating
creature
,
and
to
fall
a
victim
to
the
artifices
of
a
villain
,
who
had
the
grin
of
cunning
beneath
the
mask
of
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
never
may
.
   
<EOS>

<EOS>
Any
letter
addressed
to
me
at
the
Leather
Bottle
,
Cobham
,
Kent
,
will
be
forwarded
---
supposing
I
still
exist
.
 
<EOS>
I
hasten
from
the
sight
of
that
world
,
which
has
become
odious
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Should
I
hasten
from
it
altogether
,
pity
---
forgive
me
.
 
<EOS>
Life
,
my
dear
Pickwick
,
has
become
insupportable
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
spirit
which
burns
within
us
,
is
a
porter
's
knot
,
on
which
to
rest
the
heavy
load
of
worldly
cares
and
troubles
;
and
when
that
spirit
fails
us

the
burden
is
too
heavy

it

<EOS>
"
We
must
leave
this
place
directly
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
he
refolded
the
note
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
not
have
been
decent
for
us
to
remain
here
,
under
any
circumstances
,
after
what
has
happened
;
and
now
we
are
bound
to
follow
in
search
of
our
friend
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
so
saying
,
he
led
the
way
to
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
His
intention
was
rapidly
communicated
.
 
<EOS>
The
entreaties
to
remain
were
pressing
,
but
Mr
Pickwick
was
inflexible
.
 
<EOS>
Business
,
he
said
,
required
his
immediate
attendance
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
clergyman
was
present
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
really
going
?
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
taking
Mr
Pickwick
aside
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
reiterated
his
former
determination
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
here
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
"
is
a
little
manuscript
,
which
I
had
hoped
to
have
the
pleasure
of
reading
to
you
myself
.
<EOS>
I
found
it
on
the
death
of
a
friend
of
mine
---
a
medical
man
,
engaged
in
our
county
lunatic
asylum
---
among
a
variety
of
papers
,
which
I
had
the
option
of
destroying
or
preserving
,
as
I
thought
proper
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
believe
that
the
manuscript
is
genuine
,
though
it
certainly
is
not
in
my
friend
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
whether
it
be
the
genuine
production
of
a
maniac
,
or
founded
upon
the
ravings
of
some
unhappy
being
(
which
I
think
more
probable
)
,
read
it
,
and
judge
for
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
received
the
manuscript
,
and
parted
from
the
benevolent
old
gentleman
with
many
expressions
of
good
-
will
and
esteem
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
more
difficult
task
to
take
leave
of
the
inmates
of
Manor
Farm
,
from
whom
they
had
received
so
much
hospitality
and
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
kissed
the
young
ladies
---
we
were
going
to
say
,
as
if
they
were
his
own
daughters
,
only
,
as
he
might
possibly
have
infused
a
little
more
warmth
into
the
salutation
,
the
comparison
would
not
be
quite
appropriate
---
hugged
the
old
lady
with
filial
cordiality
;
and
patted
the
rosy
cheeks
of
the
female
servants
in
a
most
patriarchal
manner
,
as
he
slipped
into
the
hands
of
each
some
more
substantial
expression
of
his
approval
.
<EOS>
The
exchange
of
cordialities
with
their
fine
old
host
and
Mr
Trundle
was
even
more
hearty
and
prolonged
;
and
it
was
not
until
Mr
Snodgrass
had
been
several
times
called
for
,
and
at
last
emerged
from
a
dark
passage
followed
soon
after
by
Emily
(
whose
bright
eyes
looked
unusually
dim
)
,
that
the
three
friends
were
enabled
to
tear
themselves
from
their
friendly
entertainers
.
<EOS>
Many
a
backward
look
they
gave
at
the
farm
,
as
they
walked
slowly
away
;
and
many
a
kiss
did
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
waft
in
the
air
,
in
acknowledgment
of
something
very
like
a
lady
's
handkerchief
,
which
was
waved
from
one
of
the
upper
windows
,
until
a
turn
of
the
lane
hid
the
old
house
from
their
sight
.
   
<EOS>
At
Muggleton
they
procured
a
conveyance
to
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
time
they
reached
the
last
-
named
place
,
the
violence
of
their
grief
had
sufficiently
abated
to
admit
of
their
making
a
very
excellent
early
dinner
;
and
having
procured
the
necessary
information
relative
to
the
road
,
the
three
friends
set
forward
again
in
the
afternoon
to
walk
to
Cobham
.
   
<EOS>
A
delightful
walk
it
was
;
for
it
was
a
pleasant
afternoon
in
June
,
and
their
way
lay
through
a
deep
and
shady
wood
,
cooled
by
the
light
wind
which
gently
rustled
the
thick
foliage
,
and
enlivened
by
the
songs
of
the
birds
that
perched
upon
the
boughs
.
<EOS>
The
ivy
and
the
moss
crept
in
thick
clusters
over
the
old
trees
,
and
the
soft
green
turf
overspread
the
ground
like
a
silken
mat
.
 
<EOS>
They
emerged
upon
an
open
park
,
with
an
ancient
hall
,
displaying
the
quaint
and
picturesque
architecture
of
Elizabeth
's
time
.
 
<EOS>
Long
vistas
of
stately
oaks
and
elm
trees
appeared
on
every
side
;
large
herds
of
deer
were
cropping
the
fresh
grass
;
and
occasionally
a
startled
hare
scoured
along
the
ground
,
with
the
speed
of
the
shadows
thrown
by
the
light
clouds
which
swept
across
a
sunny
landscape
like
a
passing
breath
of
summer
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
this
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
about
him
---
"
if
this
were
the
place
to
which
all
who
are
troubled
with
our
friend
's
complaint
<EOS>
came
,
I
fancy
their
old
attachment
to
this
world
would
very
soon
return
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
too
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
really
,
"
added
Mr
Pickwick
,
after
half
an
hour
's
walking
had
brought
them
to
the
village
,
"
really
,
for
a
misanthrope
's
choice
<EOS>
,
this
is
one
of
the
prettiest
and
most
desirable
places
of
residence
I
ever
met
with
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
this
opinion
also
,
both
Mr
Winkle
and
Mr
Snodgrass
expressed
their
concurrence
;
and
having
been
directed
to
the
Leather
Bottle
,
a
clean
and
commodious
village
ale
-
house
,
the
three
travellers
entered
,
and
at
once
inquired
for
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Show
the
gentlemen
into
the
parlour
,
Tom
,
"
said
the
landlady
.
   
<EOS>
A
stout
country
lad
opened
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
,
and
the
three
friends
entered
a
long
,
low
-
roofed
room
,
furnished
with
a
large
number
of
high
-
backed
leather
-
cushioned
chairs
,
of
fantastic
shapes
,
and
embellished
with
a
great
variety
of
old
portraits
and
roughly
-
coloured
prints
of
some
antiquity
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
upper
end
of
the
room
was
a
table
,
with
a
white
cloth
upon
it
,
well
covered
with
a
roast
fowl
,
bacon
,
ale
,
and
et
ceteras
;
and
at
the
table
sat
Mr
Tupman
,
looking
as
unlike
a
man
who
had
taken
his
leave
of
the
world
,
as
possible
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
entrance
of
his
friends
,
that
gentleman
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
with
a
mournful
air
advanced
to
meet
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
expect
to
see
you
here
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
grasped
Mr
Pickwick
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
kind
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
sitting
down
,
and
wiping
from
his
forehead
the
perspiration
which
the
walk
had
engendered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Finish
your
dinner
,
and
walk
out
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
speak
to
you
alone
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
did
as
he
was
desired
;
and
Mr
Pickwick
having
refreshed
himself
with
a
copious
draught
of
ale
,
waited
his
friend
's
leisure
.
<EOS>
The
dinner
was
quickly
despatched
,
and
they
walked
out
together
.
   
<EOS>
For
half
an
hour
,
their
forms
might
have
been
seen
pacing
the
churchyard
to
and
fro
,
while
Mr
Pickwick
was
engaged
in
combating
his
companion
's
resolution
.
 
<EOS>
Any
repetition
of
his
arguments
would
be
useless
;
for
what
language
could
convey
to
them
that
energy
and
force
which
their
great
originator
's
manner
communicated
?
 
<EOS>
Whether
Mr
Tupman
was
already
tired
of
retirement
,
or
whether
he
was
wholly
unable
to
resist
the
eloquent
appeal
which
was
made
to
him
,
matters
not
,
he
did
NOT
resist
it
at
last
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
mattered
little
to
him
,
"
he
said
,
"
where
he
dragged
out
the
miserable
remainder
of
his
days
;
and
since
his
friend
laid
so
much
stress
upon
his
humble
companionship
,
he
was
willing
to
share
his
adventures
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
smiled
;
they
shook
hands
,
and
walked
back
to
rejoin
their
companions
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
at
this
moment
that
Mr
Pickwick
made
that
immortal
discovery
,
which
has
been
the
pride
and
boast
of
his
friends
,
and
the
envy
of
every
antiquarian
in
this
or
any
other
country
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
passed
the
door
of
their
inn
,
and
walked
a
little
way
down
the
village
,
before
they
recollected
the
precise
spot
in
which
it
stood
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
turned
back
,
Mr
Pickwick
's
eye
fell
upon
a
small
broken
stone
,
partially
buried
in
the
ground
,
in
front
of
a
cottage
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
paused
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
very
strange
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
strange
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Tupman
,
staring
eagerly
at
every
object
near
him
,
but
the
right
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
God
bless
me
<EOS>
,
what
's
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
This
last
was
an
ejaculation
of
irrepressible
astonishment
,
occasioned
by
seeing
Mr
Pickwick
,
in
his
enthusiasm
for
discovery
,
fall
on
his
knees
before
the
little
stone
,
and
commence
wiping
the
dust
off
it
with
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
an
inscription
here
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
?
"
said
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
discern
,
"
continued
Mr
Pickwick
,
rubbing
away
with
all
his
might
,
and
gazing
intently
through
his
spectacles
---
"
I
can
discern
a
cross
,
and
a
13
,
and
then
a
T^.
 
<EOS>
This
is
important
,
"
continued
Mr
Pickwick
,
starting
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
some
very
old
inscription
,
existing
perhaps
long
before
the
ancient
alms
-
houses
in
this
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
lost
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
tapped
at
the
cottage
door
.
 
<EOS>
A
labouring
man
opened
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
how
this
stone
came
here
,
my
friend
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
benevolent
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
doan't
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
man
civilly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
here
<EOS>
long
afore
<EOS>
I
was
born
,
or
any
on
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
glanced
triumphantly
at
his
companion
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
---
you
---
are
not
particularly
attached
to
it
,
I
dare
say
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
trembling
with
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
mind
selling
it
,
now
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
but
who
'd
buy
it
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
man
,
with
an
expression
of
face
which
he
probably
meant
to
be
very
cunning
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
give
you
ten
shillings
for
it
,
at
once
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
if
you
would
take
it
up
for
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
astonishment
of
the
village
may
be
easily
imagined
,
when
(
the
little
stone
having
been
raised
with
one
wrench
of
a
spade
)
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
by
dint
of
great
personal
exertion
,
bore
it
with
his
own
hands
to
the
inn
,
and
after
having
carefully
washed
it
,
deposited
it
on
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
The
exultation
and
joy
of
the
Pickwickians
knew
no
bounds
,
when
their
patience
and
assiduity
,
their
washing
and
scraping
,
were
crowned
with
success
.
 
<EOS>
The
stone
was
uneven
and
broken
,
and
the
letters
were
straggling
and
irregular
,
but
the
following
fragment
of
an
inscription
was
clearly
to
be
deciphered
:

Mr
Pickwick
's
eyes
sparkled
with
delight
,
as
he
sat
and
gloated
over
the
treasure
he
had
discovered
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
attained
one
of
the
greatest
objects
of
his
ambition
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
county
known
to
abound
in
the
remains
of
the
early
ages
;
in
a
village
in
which
there
still
existed
some
memorials
of
the
olden
time
,
he
---
he
,
the
chairman
of
the
Pickwick
Club
---
had
discovered
a
strange
and
curious
inscription
of
unquestionable
antiquity
,
which
had
wholly
escaped
the
observation
of
the
many
learned
men
who
had
preceded
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
trust
the
evidence
of
his
senses
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
---
this
,
"
said
he
,
"
determines
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
return
to
town
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
!
"
exclaimed
his
admiring
followers
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
treasure
must
be
at
once
deposited
where
it
can
be
thoroughly
investigated
and
properly
understood
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
another
reason
for
this
step
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
few
days
,
an
election
is
to
take
place
for
the
borough
of
Eatanswill
,
at
which
Mr
Perker
,
a
gentleman
whom
I
lately
met
,
is
the
agent
of
one
of
the
candidates
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
behold
,
and
minutely
examine
,
a
scene
so
interesting
to
every
Englishman
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
will
,
"
was
the
animated
cry
of
three
voices
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
looked
round
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
attachment
and
fervour
of
his
followers
lighted
up
a
glow
of
enthusiasm
within
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
their
leader
,
and
he
felt
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
us
celebrate
this
happy
meeting
with
a
convivial
glass
,
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
This
proposition
,
like
the
other
,
was
received
with
unanimous
applause
.
 
<EOS>
Having
himself
deposited
the
important
stone
in
a
small
deal
box
,
purchased
from
the
landlady
for
the
purpose
,
he
placed
himself
in
an
arm
-
chair
,
at
the
head
of
the
table
;
and
the
evening
was
devoted
to
festivity
and
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
past
eleven
o'clock
---
a
late
hour
for
the
little
village
of
Cobham
---
when
Mr
Pickwick
retired
to
the
bedroom
which
had
been
prepared
for
his
reception
.
 
<EOS>
He
threw
open
the
lattice
window
,
and
setting
his
light
upon
the
table
,
fell
into
a
train
of
meditation
on
the
hurried
events
of
the
two
preceding
days
.
   
<EOS>
The
hour
and
the
place
were
both
favourable
to
contemplation
;
Mr
Pickwick
was
roused
by
the
church
clock
striking
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
stroke
of
the
hour
sounded
solemnly
in
his
ear
,
but
when
the
bell
ceased
the
stillness
seemed
insupportable
---
he
almost
felt
as
if
he
had
lost
a
companion
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
nervous
and
excited
;
and
hastily
undressing
himself
and
placing
his
light
in
the
chimney
,
got
into
bed
.
   
<EOS>
Every
one
has
experienced
that
disagreeable
state
of
mind
,
in
which
a
sensation
of
bodily
weariness
in
vain
contends
against
an
inability
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Mr
Pickwick
's
condition
at
this
moment
:
he
tossed
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
;
and
perseveringly
closed
his
eyes
as
if
to
coax
himself
to
slumber
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
of
no
use
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
the
unwonted
exertion
he
had
undergone
,
or
the
heat
,
or
the
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
or
the
strange
bed
---
whatever
it
was
,
his
thoughts
kept
reverting
very
uncomfortably
to
the
grim
pictures
downstairs
,
and
the
old
stories
to
which
they
had
given
rise
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
After
half
an
hour
's
tumbling
about
,
he
came
to
the
unsatisfactory
conclusion
,
that
it
was
of
no
use
trying
to
sleep
;
so
he
got
up
and
partially
dressed
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Anything
,
he
thought
,
was
better
than
lying
there
fancying
all
kinds
of
horrors
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
out
of
the
window
<EOS>
---
it
was
very
dark
.
 
<EOS>
He
walked
about
the
room
<EOS>
---
it
was
very
lonely
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
taken
a
few
turns
from
the
door
to
the
window
,
and
from
the
window
to
the
door
,
when
the
clergyman
's
manuscript
for
the
first
time
entered
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
good
thought
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
failed
to
interest
him
,
it
might
send
him
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
it
from
his
coat
pocket
,
and
drawing
a
small
table
towards
his
bedside
,
trimmed
the
light
,
put
on
his
spectacles
,
and
composed
himself
to
read
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
strange
handwriting
,
and
the
paper
was
much
soiled
and
blotted
.
 
<EOS>
The
title
gave
him
a
sudden
start
,
too
;
and
he
could
not
avoid
casting
a
wistful
glance
round
the
room
.
<EOS>
Reflecting
on
the
absurdity
of
giving
way
to
such
feelings
,
however
,
he
trimmed
the
light
again
,
and
read
as
follows
:
---
     
A
MADMAN
'S
MANUSCRIPT
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
---
<EOS>
a
madman
's
!
 
<EOS>
How
that
word
would
have
struck
to
my
heart
,
many
years
ago
!
 
<EOS>
How
it
would
have
roused
the
terror
that
used
to
come
upon
me
sometimes
,
sending
the
blood
hissing
and
tingling
through
my
veins
,
till
the
cold
dew
of
fear
stood
in
large
drops
upon
my
skin
,
and
my
knees
knocked
together
with
fright
!
 
<EOS>
I
like
it
now
though
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
fine
name
.
 
<EOS>
Show
me
the
monarch
whose
angry
frown
was
ever
feared
like
the
glare
of
a
madman
's
eye
---
whose
cord
and
axe
were
ever
half
so
sure
as
a
madman
's
gripe
.
 
<EOS>
Ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
grand
thing
to
be
mad
!
<EOS>
to
be
peeped
at
like
a
wild
lion
through
the
iron
bars
---
to
gnash
one
's
teeth
and
howl
,
through
the
long
still
night
,
to
the
merry
ring
of
a
heavy
chain
and
to
roll
and
twine
among
the
straw
,
transported
with
such
brave
music
.
 
<EOS>
Hurrah
for
the
madhouse
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
it
's
a
rare
place
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
remember
days
when
I
was
afraid
of
being
mad
;
when
I
used
to
start
from
my
sleep
,
and
fall
upon
my
knees
,
and
pray
to
be
spared
from
the
curse
of
my
race
;
when
I
rushed
from
the
sight
of
merriment
or
happiness
,
to
hide
myself
in
some
lonely
place
,
and
spend
the
weary
hours
in
watching
the
progress
of
the
fever
that
was
to
consume
my
brain
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
that
madness
was
mixed
up
with
my
very
blood
,
and
the
marrow
of
my
bones
!
<EOS>
that
one
generation
had
passed
away
without
the
pestilence
appearing
among
them
,
and
that
I
was
the
first
in
whom
it
would
revive
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
it
must
be
so
:
<EOS>
that
so
it
always
had
been
,
and
so
it
ever
would
be
:
<EOS>
and
when
I
cowered
in
some
obscure
corner
of
a
crowded
room
,
and
saw
men
whisper
,
and
point
,
and
turn
their
eyes
towards
me
,
I
knew
they
were
telling
each
other
of
the
doomed
madman
;
and
I
slunk
away
again
to
mope
in
solitude
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
this
for
years
;
long
,
long
years
they
were
.
 
<EOS>
The
nights
here
are
long
sometimes
---
very
long
;
but
they
are
nothing
to
the
restless
nights
,
and
dreadful
dreams
I
had
at
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
makes
me
cold
to
remember
them
.
 
<EOS>
Large
dusky
forms
with
sly
and
jeering
faces
crouched
in
the
corners
of
the
room
,
and
bent
over
my
bed
at
night
,
tempting
me
to
madness
.
 
<EOS>
They
told
me
in
low
whispers
,
that
the
floor
of
the
old
house
in
which
my
father
died
,
was
stained
with
his
own
blood
,
shed
by
his
own
hand
in
raging
madness
.
 
<EOS>
I
drove
my
fingers
into
my
ears
,
but
they
screamed
into
my
head
till
the
room
rang
with
it
,
that
in
one
generation
before
him
the
madness
slumbered
,
but
that
his
grandfather
had
lived
for
years
with
his
hands
fettered
to
the
ground
,
to
prevent
his
tearing
himself
to
pieces
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
they
told
the
truth
---
I
knew
it
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
found
it
out
years
before
,
though
they
had
tried
to
keep
it
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
too
cunning
for
them
,
madman
as
they
thought
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
last
it
came
upon
me
,
and
I
wondered
how
I
could
ever
have
feared
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
go
into
the
world
now
,
and
laugh
and
shout
with
the
best
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
I
was
mad
,
but
they
did
not
even
suspect
it
.
 
<EOS>
How
I
used
to
hug
myself
with
delight
,
when
I
thought
of
the
fine
trick
I
was
playing
them
after
their
old
pointing
and
leering
,
when
I
was
not
mad
,
but
only
dreading
that
I
might
one
day
become
so
!
 
<EOS>
And
how
I
used
to
laugh
for
joy
,
when
I
was
alone
,
and
thought
how
well
I
kept
my
secret
,
and
how
quickly
my
kind
friends
would
have
fallen
from
me
,
if
they
had
known
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
screamed
with
ecstasy
when
I
dined
alone
with
some
fine
roaring
fellow
,
to
think
how
pale
he
would
have
turned
,
and
how
fast
he
would
have
run
,
if
he
had
known
that
the
dear
friend
who
sat
close
to
him
,
sharpening
a
bright
,
glittering
knife
,
was
a
madman
with
all
the
power
,
and
half
the
will
,
to
plunge
it
in
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
it
was
a
merry
life
!
   
<EOS>
"
Riches
became
mine
,
wealth
poured
in
upon
me
,
and
I
rioted
in
pleasures
enhanced
a
thousandfold
to
me
by
the
consciousness
of
my
well
-
kept
secret
.
 
<EOS>
I
inherited
an
estate
.
 
<EOS>
The
law
---
the
eagle
-
eyed
law
itself
---
had
been
deceived
,
and
had
handed
over
disputed
thousands
to
a
madman
's
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Where
was
the
wit
of
the
sharp
-
sighted
men
of
sound
mind
?
 
<EOS>
Where
the
dexterity
of
the
lawyers
,
eager
to
discover
a
flaw
?
 
<EOS>
The
madman
's
cunning
had
overreached
them
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
money
.
 
<EOS>
How
I
was
courted
!
 
<EOS>
I
spent
it
profusely
.
 
<EOS>
How
I
was
praised
!
 
<EOS>
How
those
three
proud
,
overbearing
brothers
humbled
themselves
before
me
!
 
<EOS>
The
old
,
white
-
headed
father
,
too
---
such
deference
---
<EOS>
such
respect
---
such
devoted
friendship
<EOS>
---
he
worshipped
me
!
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
had
a
daughter
,
and
the
young
men
a
sister
;
and
all
the
five
were
poor
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
rich
;
and
when
I
married
the
girl
,
I
saw
a
smile
of
triumph
play
upon
the
faces
of
her
needy
relatives
,
as
they
thought
of
their
well
-
planned
scheme
,
and
their
fine
prize
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
for
me
to
smile
.
 
<EOS>
To
smile
!
 
<EOS>
To
laugh
outright
,
and
tear
my
hair
,
and
roll
upon
the
ground
with
shrieks
of
merriment
.
 
<EOS>
They
little
thought
they
had
married
her
to
a
madman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
had
known
it
,
would
they
have
saved
her
?
 
<EOS>
A
sister
's
happiness
against
her
husband
's
gold
.
 
<EOS>
The
lightest
feather
I
blow
into
the
air
,
against
the
gay
chain
that
ornaments
my
body
!
   
<EOS>
"
In
one
thing
I
was
deceived
with
all
my
cunning
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
not
been
mad
---
for
though
we
madmen
are
sharp
-
witted
enough
,
we
get
bewildered
sometimes
---
I
should
have
known
that
the
girl
would
rather
have
been
placed
,
stiff
and
cold
in
a
dull
leaden
coffin
,
than
borne
an
envied
bride
to
my
rich
,
glittering
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
known
that
her
heart
was
with
the
dark
-
eyed
boy
whose
name
I
once
heard
her
breathe
in
her
troubled
sleep
;
and
that
she
had
been
sacrificed
to
me
,
to
relieve
the
poverty
of
the
old
,
white
-
headed
man
and
the
haughty
brothers
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
remember
forms
or
faces
now
,
but
I
know
the
girl
was
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
she
was
;
for
in
the
bright
moonlight
nights
,
when
I
start
up
from
my
sleep
,
and
all
is
quiet
about
me
,
I
see
,
standing
still
and
motionless
in
one
corner
of
this
cell
,
a
slight
and
wasted
figure
with
long
black
hair
,
which
,
streaming
down
her
back
,
stirs
with
no
earthly
wind
,
and
eyes
that
fix
their
gaze
on
me
,
and
never
wink
or
close
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
the
blood
chills
at
my
heart
as
I
write
it
down
<EOS>
---
that
form
is
HERS
;
the
face
is
very
pale
,
and
the
eyes
are
glassy
bright
;
but
I
know
them
well
.
 
<EOS>
That
figure
never
moves
;
it
never
frowns
and
mouths
as
others
do
,
<EOS>
that
fill
this
place
sometimes
;
but
it
is
much
more
dreadful
to
me
,
even
than
the
spirits
that
tempted
me
many
years
ago
<EOS>
---
it
comes
fresh
from
the
grave
;
and
is
so
very
death
-
like
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
nearly
a
year
I
saw
that
face
grow
paler
;
for
nearly
a
year
I
saw
the
tears
steal
down
the
mournful
cheeks
,
and
never
knew
the
cause
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
it
out
at
last
though
.
 
<EOS>
They
could
not
keep
it
from
me
long
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
never
liked
me
;
I
had
never
thought
she
did
:
she
despised
my
wealth
,
and
hated
the
splendour
in
which
she
lived
;
but
I
had
not
expected
that
.
 
<EOS>
She
loved
another
.
 
<EOS>
This
I
had
never
thought
of
.
 
<EOS>
Strange
feelings
came
over
me
,
and
thoughts
,
forced
upon
me
by
some
secret
power
,
whirled
round
and
round
my
brain
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
hate
her
,
though
I
hated
the
boy
she
still
wept
for
.
 
<EOS>
I
pitied
---
<EOS>
yes
,
I
pitied
---
<EOS>
the
wretched
life
to
which
her
cold
and
selfish
relations
had
doomed
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
that
she
could
not
live
long
;
but
the
thought
that
before
her
death
she
might
give
birth
to
some
ill
-
fated
being
,
destined
to
hand
down
madness
to
its
offspring
,
determined
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
resolved
to
kill
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
many
weeks
I
thought
of
poison
,
and
then
of
drowning
,
and
then
of
fire
.
 
<EOS>
A
fine
sight
,
the
grand
house
in
flames
,
and
the
madman
's
wife
smouldering
away
to
cinders
.
 
<EOS>
Think
of
the
jest
of
a
large
reward
,
too
,
and
of
some
sane
man
swinging
in
the
wind
for
a
deed
he
never
did
,
and
all
through
a
madman
's
cunning
!
<EOS>
I
thought
often
of
this
,
but
I
gave
it
up
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
the
pleasure
of
stropping
the
razor
day
after
day
,
feeling
the
sharp
edge
,
and
thinking
of
the
gash
one
stroke
of
its
thin
,
bright
edge
would
make
!
"
<EOS>
At
last
the
old
spirits
who
had
been
with
me
so
often
before
whispered
in
my
ear
that
the
time
was
come
,
and
thrust
the
open
razor
into
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
grasped
it
firmly
,
rose
softly
from
the
bed
,
and
leaned
over
my
sleeping
wife
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
was
buried
in
her
hands
.
 
<EOS>
I
withdrew
them
softly
,
and
they
fell
listlessly
on
her
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
weeping
;
for
the
traces
of
the
tears
were
still
wet
upon
her
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
was
calm
and
placid
;
and
even
as
I
looked
upon
it
,
a
tranquil
smile
lighted
up
her
pale
features
.
<EOS>
I
laid
my
hand
softly
on
her
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
She
started
---
it
was
only
a
passing
dream
.
 
<EOS>
I
leaned
forward
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
screamed
,
and
woke
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
motion
of
my
hand
,
and
she
would
never
again
have
uttered
cry
or
sound
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
startled
,
and
drew
back
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
fixed
on
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
not
how
it
was
,
but
they
cowed
and
frightened
me
;
and
I
quailed
beneath
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
rose
from
the
bed
,
still
gazing
fixedly
and
steadily
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
trembled
;
the
razor
was
in
my
hand
,
but
I
could
not
move
.
 
<EOS>
She
made
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
As
she
neared
it
,
she
turned
,
and
withdrew
her
eyes
from
my
face
.
<EOS>
The
spell
was
broken
.
 
<EOS>
I
bounded
forward
,
and
clutched
her
by
the
arm
.
 
<EOS>
Uttering
shriek
upon
shriek
<EOS>
,
she
sank
upon
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
I
could
have
killed
her
without
a
struggle
;
but
the
house
was
alarmed
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
the
tread
of
footsteps
on
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
replaced
the
razor
in
its
usual
drawer
,
unfastened
the
door
,
and
called
loudly
for
assistance
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
came
,
and
raised
her
,
and
placed
her
on
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
She
lay
bereft
of
animation
for
hours
;
and
when
life
,
look
,
and
speech
returned
,
her
senses
had
deserted
her
,
and
she
raved
wildly
and
furiously
.
   
<EOS>
"
Doctors
were
called
in
---
great
men
who
rolled
up
to
my
door
in
easy
carriages
,
with
fine
horses
and
gaudy
servants
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
at
her
bedside
for
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
a
great
meeting
and
consulted
together
in
low
and
solemn
voices
in
another
room
.
 
<EOS>
One
,
the
cleverest
and
most
celebrated
among
them
,
took
me
aside
,
and
bidding
me
prepare
for
the
worst
,
told
me
---
me
,
the
madman
!
---
that
my
wife
was
mad
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
close
beside
me
at
an
open
window
,
his
eyes
looking
in
my
face
,
and
his
hand
laid
upon
my
arm
.
 
<EOS>
With
one
effort
,
I
could
have
hurled
him
into
the
street
beneath
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
rare
sport
to
have
done
it
;
but
my
secret
was
at
stake
,
and
I
let
him
go
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
days
after
,
they
told
me
I
must
place
her
under
some
restraint
:
I
must
provide
a
keeper
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
!
 
<EOS>
I
went
into
the
open
fields
where
none
could
hear
me
,
and
laughed
till
the
air
resounded
with
my
shouts
!
   
<EOS>
"
She
died
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
white
-
headed
old
man
followed
her
to
the
grave
,
and
the
proud
brothers
dropped
a
tear
over
the
insensible
corpse
of
her
whose
sufferings
they
had
regarded
in
her
lifetime
with
muscles
of
iron
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
was
food
for
my
secret
mirth
,
and
I
laughed
behind
the
white
handkerchief
which
I
held
up
to
my
face
,
as
we
rode
home
,
till
the
tears
Came
into
my
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
though
I
had
carried
my
object
and
killed
her
,
I
was
restless
and
disturbed
,
and
I
felt
that
before
long
my
secret
must
be
known
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
hide
the
wild
mirth
and
joy
which
boiled
within
me
,
and
made
me
when
I
was
alone
,
at
home
,
jump
up
and
beat
my
hands
together
,
and
dance
round
and
round
,
and
roar
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
went
out
,
and
saw
the
busy
crowds
hurrying
about
the
streets
;
or
to
the
theatre
,
and
heard
the
sound
of
music
,
and
beheld
the
people
dancing
,
I
felt
such
glee
,
that
I
could
have
rushed
among
them
,
and
torn
them
to
pieces
limb
from
limb
,
and
howled
in
transport
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
ground
my
teeth
,
and
struck
my
feet
upon
the
floor
,
and
drove
my
sharp
nails
into
my
hands
.
 
<EOS>
I
kept
it
down
;
and
no
one
knew
I
was
a
madman
yet
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
remember
---
though
it
's
one
of
the
last
things
I
can
remember
:
for
now
I
mix
up
realities
with
my
dreams
,
and
having
so
much
to
do
,
and
being
always
hurried
here
,
have
no
time
to
separate
the
two
,
from
some
strange
confusion
in
which
they
get
involved
 
<EOS>
---
I
remember
how
I
let
it
out
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
see
their
frightened
looks
now
,
and
feel
the
ease
with
which
I
flung
them
from
me
,
and
dashed
my
clenched
fist
into
their
white
faces
,
and
then
flew
like
the
wind
,
and
left
them
screaming
and
shouting
far
behind
.
 
<EOS>
The
strength
of
a
giant
comes
upon
me
when
I
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
---
see
how
this
iron
bar
bends
beneath
my
furious
wrench
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
snap
it
like
a
twig
,
only
there
are
long
galleries
here
with
many
doors
<EOS>
---
I
do
n't
think
I
could
find
my
way
along
them
;
and
even
if
I
could
,
I
know
there
are
iron
gates
below
which
they
keep
locked
and
barred
.
 
<EOS>
They
know
what
a
clever
madman
I
have
been
,
and
they
are
proud
to
have
me
here
,
to
show
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
:
yes
,
I
had
been
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
late
at
night
when
I
reached
home
,
and
found
the
proudest
of
the
three
proud
brothers
waiting
to
see
me
---
urgent
business
<EOS>
he
said
:
I
recollect
it
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
hated
that
man
with
all
a
madman
's
hate
.
 
<EOS>
Many
and
many
a
time
had
my
fingers
longed
to
tear
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
told
me
he
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
ran
swiftly
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
word
to
say
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
dismissed
the
servants
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
late
,
and
we
were
alone
together
---
for
the
first
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
kept
my
eyes
carefully
from
him
at
first
,
for
I
knew
what
he
little
thought
---
<EOS>
and
I
gloried
in
the
knowledge
---
that
the
light
of
madness
gleamed
from
them
like
fire
.
 
<EOS>
We
sat
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
My
recent
dissipation
,
and
strange
remarks
,
made
so
soon
after
his
sister
's
death
,
were
an
insult
to
her
memory
.
 
<EOS>
Coupling
together
many
circumstances
which
had
at
first
escaped
his
observation
,
he
thought
I
had
not
treated
her
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
wished
to
know
whether
he
was
right
in
inferring
that
I
meant
to
cast
a
reproach
upon
her
memory
,
and
a
disrespect
upon
her
family
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
due
to
the
uniform
he
wore
,
to
demand
this
explanation
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
man
had
a
commission
in
the
army
---
a
commission
,
purchased
with
my
money
,
and
his
sister
's
misery
!
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
man
who
had
been
foremost
in
the
plot
to
ensnare
me
,
and
grasp
my
wealth
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
man
who
had
been
the
main
instrument
in
forcing
his
sister
to
we
d
me
;
<EOS>
well
knowing
that
her
heart
was
given
to
that
puling
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Due
to
his
uniform
!
 
<EOS>
The
livery
of
his
degradation
!
 
<EOS>
I
turned
my
eyes
upon
him
---
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
it
---
but
I
spoke
not
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
saw
the
sudden
change
that
came
upon
him
beneath
my
gaze
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
bold
man
,
but
the
colour
faded
from
his
face
,
and
he
drew
back
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
I
dragged
mine
nearer
to
him
;
and
I
laughed
<EOS>
---
I
was
very
merry
then
---
I
saw
him
shudder
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
the
madness
rising
within
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
afraid
of
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
You
were
very
fond
of
your
sister
when
she
was
alive
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
---
"
Very
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
looked
uneasily
round
him
,
and
I
saw
his
hand
grasp
the
back
of
his
chair
;
but
he
said
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
You
villain
,
"
said
I
,
<EOS>
"
I
found
you
out
:
<EOS>
I
discovered
your
hellish
plots
against
me
;
I
know
her
heart
was
fixed
on
some
one
else
before
you
compelled
her
to
marry
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
<EOS>
---
I
know
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
jumped
suddenly
from
his
chair
,
brandished
it
aloft
,
and
bid
me
stand
back
---
for
I
took
care
to
be
getting
closer
to
him
all
the
time
I
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
screamed
rather
than
talked
,
for
I
felt
tumultuous
passions
eddying
through
my
veins
,
and
the
old
spirits
whispering
and
taunting
me
to
tear
his
heart
out
.
   
"
<EOS>
"
Damn
you
,
"
said
I
,
starting
up
,
and
rushing
upon
him
;
"
I
killed
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
madman
.
 
<EOS>
Down
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Blood
,
blood
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
have
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
turned
aside
with
one
blow
the
chair
he
hurled
at
me
in
his
terror
,
and
closed
with
him
;
and
with
a
heavy
crash
we
rolled
upon
the
floor
together
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
fine
struggle
that
;
for
he
was
a
tall
,
strong
man
,
fighting
for
his
life
;
and
I
,
a
powerful
madman
,
thirsting
to
destroy
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
no
strength
could
equal
mine
,
and
I
was
right
.
 
<EOS>
Right
again
,
though
a
madman
!
 
<EOS>
His
struggles
grew
fainter
.
<EOS>
I
knelt
upon
his
chest
,
and
clasped
his
brawny
throat
firmly
with
both
hands
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
grew
purple
;
his
eyes
were
starting
from
his
head
,
and
with
protruded
tongue
,
he
seemed
to
mock
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
squeezed
the
tighter
.
<EOS>
"
The
door
was
suddenly
burst
open
with
a
loud
noise
,
and
a
crowd
of
people
rushed
forward
,
crying
aloud
to
each
other
to
secure
the
madman
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
secret
was
out
;
and
my
only
struggle
now
was
for
liberty
and
freedom
.
 
<EOS>
I
gained
my
feet
before
a
hand
was
on
me
,
threw
myself
among
my
assailants
,
and
cleared
my
way
with
my
strong
arm
,
as
if
I
bore
a
hatchet
in
my
hand
,
and
hewed
them
down
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
gained
the
door
,
dropped
over
the
banisters
,
and
in
an
instant
was
in
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
"
Straight
and
swift
I
ran
,
and
no
one
dared
to
stop
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
the
noise
of
the
feet
behind
,
and
redoubled
my
speed
.
 
<EOS>
It
grew
fainter
and
fainter
in
the
distance
,
and
at
length
died
away
altogether
;
but
on
I
bounded
,
through
marsh
and
rivulet
,
over
fence
and
wall
,
with
a
wild
shout
which
was
taken
up
by
the
strange
beings
that
flocked
around
me
on
every
side
,
and
swelled
the
sound
,
till
it
pierced
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
borne
upon
the
arms
of
demons
who
swept
along
upon
the
wind
,
and
bore
down
bank
and
hedge
before
them
,
and
spun
me
round
and
round
with
a
rustle
and
a
speed
that
made
my
head
swim
,
until
at
last
they
threw
me
from
them
with
a
violent
shock
,
and
I
fell
heavily
upon
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
woke
I
found
myself
here
---
here
in
this
gray
cell
,
where
the
sunlight
seldom
comes
,
and
the
moon
steals
in
,
in
rays
which
only
serve
to
show
the
dark
shadows
about
me
,
and
that
silent
figure
in
its
old
corner
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
lie
awake
,
I
can
sometimes
hear
strange
shrieks
and
cries
from
distant
parts
of
this
large
place
.
 
<EOS>
What
they
are
,
I
know
not
;
but
they
neither
come
from
that
pale
form
,
nor
does
it
regard
them
.
 
<EOS>
For
from
the
first
shades
of
dusk
till
the
earliest
light
of
morning
,
it
still
stands
motionless
in
the
same
place
,
listening
to
the
music
of
my
iron
chain
,
and
watching
my
gambols
on
my
straw
bed
.

At
the
end
of
the
manuscript
was
written
,
in
another
hand
,
this
note
:
---
   
<EOS>
[
The
unhappy
man
whose
ravings
are
recorded
above
,
was
a
melancholy
instance
of
the
baneful
results
of
energies
misdirected
in
early
life
,
and
excesses
prolonged
until
their
consequences
could
never
be
repaired
.
 
<EOS>
The
thoughtless
riot
,
dissipation
,
and
debauchery
of
his
younger
days
produced
fever
and
delirium
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
effects
of
the
latter
was
the
strange
delusion
,
founded
upon
a
well
-
known
medical
theory
,
strongly
contended
for
by
some
,
and
as
strongly
contested
by
others
,
that
an
hereditary
madness
existed
in
his
family
.
 
<EOS>
This
produced
a
settled
gloom
,
which
in
time
developed
a
morbid
insanity
,
and
finally
terminated
in
raving
madness
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
events
he
detailed
,
though
distorted
in
the
description
by
his
diseased
imagination
,
really
happened
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
only
matter
of
wonder
to
those
who
were
acquainted
with
the
vices
of
his
early
career
,
that
his
passions
,
when
no
longer
controlled
by
reason
,
did
not
lead
him
to
the
commission
of
still
more
frightful
deeds
.

Mr
Pickwick
's
candle
was
just
expiring
in
the
socket
,
as
he
concluded
the
perusal
of
the
old
clergyman
's
manuscript
;
and
when
the
light
went
suddenly
out
,
without
any
previous
flicker
by
way
of
warning
,
it
communicated
a
very
considerable
start
to
his
excited
frame
.
 
<EOS>
Hastily
throwing
off
such
articles
of
clothing
as
he
had
put
on
when
he
rose
from
his
uneasy
bed
,
and
casting
a
fearful
glance
around
,
he
once
more
scrambled
hastily
between
the
sheets
,
and
soon
fell
fast
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
The
sun
was
shining
brilliantly
into
his
chamber
,
when
he
awoke
,
and
the
morning
was
far
advanced
.
 
<EOS>
The
gloom
which
had
oppressed
him
on
the
previous
night
had
disappeared
with
the
dark
shadows
which
shrouded
the
landscape
,
and
his
thoughts
and
feelings
were
as
light
and
gay
as
the
morning
itself
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
hearty
breakfast
,
the
four
gentlemen
sallied
forth
to
walk
to
Gravesend
,
followed
by
a
man
bearing
the
stone
in
its
deal
box
.
<EOS>
They
reached
the
town
about
one
o'clock
(
<EOS>
their
luggage
they
had
directed
to
be
forwarded
to
the
city
,
from
Rochester
)
,
and
being
fortunate
enough
to
secure
places
on
the
outside
of
a
coach
,
arrived
in
London
in
sound
health
and
spirits
,
on
that
same
afternoon
.
   
<EOS>
The
next
three
or
four
days
were
occupied
with
the
preparations
which
were
necessary
for
their
journey
to
the
borough
of
Eatanswill
.
 
<EOS>
As
any
references
to
that
most
important
undertaking
demands
a
separate
chapter
,
we
may
devote
the
few
lines
which
remain
at
the
close
of
this
,
to
narrate
,
with
great
brevity
,
the
history
of
the
antiquarian
discovery
.
   
<EOS>
It
appears
from
the
Transactions
of
the
Club
,
then
,
that
Mr
Pickwick
lectured
upon
the
discovery
at
a
General
Club
Meeting
,
convened
on
the
night
succeeding
their
return
,
and
entered
into
a
variety
of
ingenious
and
erudite
speculations
on
the
meaning
of
the
inscription
.
 
<EOS>
It
also
appears
that
a
skilful
artist
executed
a
faithful
delineation
of
the
curiosity
,
which
was
engraven
on
stone
,
and
presented
to
the
Royal
Antiquarian
Society
,
and
other
learned
bodies
:
that
heart
-
burnings
and
jealousies
without
number
were
created
by
rival
controversies
which
were
penned
upon
the
subject
;
and
that
Mr
Pickwick
himself
wrote
a
pamphlet
,
containing
ninety
-
six
pages
of
very
small
print
,
and
twenty
-
seven
different
readings
of
the
inscription
:
that
three
old
gentlemen
cut
off
their
eldest
sons
with
a
shilling
a
-
piece
for
presuming
to
doubt
the
antiquity
of
the
fragment
;
and
that
one
enthusiastic
individual
cut
himself
off
prematurely
,
in
despair
at
being
unable
to
fathom
its
meaning
:
that
Mr
Pickwick
was
elected
an
honorary
member
of
seventeen
native
and
foreign
societies
,
for
making
the
discovery
:
that
none
of
the
seventeen
could
make
anything
of
it
;
but
that
all
the
seventeen
agreed
it
was
very
extraordinary
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Blotton
,
indeed
---
and
the
name
will
be
doomed
to
the
undying
contempt
of
those
who
cultivate
the
mysterious
and
the
sublime
---
Mr
Blotton
,
we
say
,
with
the
doubt
and
cavilling
peculiar
to
vulgar
minds
,
presumed
to
state
a
view
of
the
case
,
as
degrading
as
ridiculous
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Blotton
,
with
a
mean
desire
to
tarnish
the
lustre
of
the
immortal
name
of
Pickwick
,
actually
undertook
a
journey
to
Cobham
in
person
,
and
on
his
return
,
sarcastically
observed
in
an
oration
at
the
club
,
that
he
had
seen
the
man
from
whom
the
stone
was
purchased
;
that
the
man
presumed
the
stone
to
be
ancient
,
but
solemnly
denied
the
antiquity
of
the
inscription
---
inasmuch
as
he
represented
it
to
have
been
rudely
carved
by
himself
in
an
idle
mood
,
and
to
display
letters
intended
to
bear
neither
more
or
less
than
the
simple
construction
of
---
"
BILL
STUMPS
,
HIS
MARK
"
;
and
that
Mr
Stumps
,
being
little
in
the
habit
of
original
composition
,
and
more
accustomed
to
be
guided
by
the
sound
of
words
than
by
the
strict
rules
of
orthography
,
had
omitted
the
concluding
"
L
"
of
his
Christian
name
.
   
<EOS>
The
Pickwick
Club
(
as
might
have
been
expected
from
so
enlightened
an
institution
)
received
this
statement
with
the
contempt
it
deserved
,
expelled
the
presumptuous
and
ill
-
conditioned
Blotton
from
the
society
,
and
voted
Mr
Pickwick
a
pair
of
gold
spectacles
,
in
token
of
their
confidence
and
approbation
:
in
return
for
which
,
Mr
Pickwick
caused
a
portrait
of
himself
to
be
painted
,
and
hung
up
in
the
club
room
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Blotton
was
ejected
but
not
conquered
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
wrote
a
pamphlet
,
addressed
to
the
seventeen
learned
societies
,
native
and
foreign
,
containing
a
repetition
of
the
statement
he
had
already
made
,
and
rather
more
than
half
intimating
his
opinion
that
the
seventeen
learned
societies
were
so
many
"
humbugs
.
<EOS>
"
Hereupon
,
the
virtuous
indignation
of
the
seventeen
learned
societies
being
roused
,
several
fresh
pamphlets
appeared
;
the
foreign
learned
societies
corresponded
with
the
native
learned
societies
;
the
native
learned
societies
translated
the
pamphlets
of
the
foreign
learned
societies
into
English
;
the
foreign
learned
societies
translated
the
pamphlets
of
the
native
learned
societies
into
all
sorts
of
languages
;
and
thus
commenced
that
celebrated
scientific
discussion
so
well
known
to
all
men
,
as
the
Pickwick
controversy
.
   
<EOS>
But
this
base
attempt
to
injure
Mr
Pickwick
recoiled
upon
the
head
of
its
calumnious
author
.
 
<EOS>
The
seventeen
learned
societies
unanimously
voted
the
presumptuous
Blotton
an
ignorant
meddler
,
and
forthwith
set
to
work
upon
more
treatises
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
this
day
the
stone
remains
,
an
illegible
monument
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
greatness
,
and
a
lasting
trophy
to
the
littleness
of
his
enemies
.

<EOS>
Descriptive
of
a
very
important
proceeding
on
the
part
of
Mr
Pickwick
;
no
less
an
epoch
in
his
life
,
than
in
this
history
 
Mr
Pickwick
's
apartments
in
Goswell
Street
,
although
on
a
limited
scale
,
were
not
only
of
a
very
neat
and
comfortable
description
,
but
peculiarly
adapted
for
the
residence
of
a
man
of
his
genius
and
observation
.
 
<EOS>
His
sitting
-
room
was
the
first
-
floor
front
,
his
bedroom
<EOS>
the
second
-
floor
front
;
and
thus
,
whether
he
were
sitting
at
his
desk
in
his
parlour
,
or
standing
before
the
dressing
-
glass
in
his
dormitory
,
he
had
an
equal
opportunity
of
contemplating
human
nature
in
all
the
numerous
phases
it
exhibits
,
in
that
not
more
populous
than
popular
thoroughfare
.
 
<EOS>
His
landlady
,
Mrs
Bardell
---
the
relict
and
sole
executrix
of
a
deceased
custom
-
house
officer
---
was
a
comely
woman
of
bustling
manners
and
agreeable
appearance
,
with
a
natural
genius
for
cooking
,
improved
by
study
and
long
practice
,
into
an
exquisite
talent
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
no
children
,
no
servants
,
no
fowls
.
<EOS>
The
only
other
inmates
of
the
house
were
a
large
man
and
a
small
boy
;
the
first
a
lodger
,
the
second
a
production
of
Mrs
Bardell
's
.
 
<EOS>
The
large
man
was
always
home
precisely
at
ten
o'clock
at
night
,
at
which
hour
he
regularly
condensed
himself
into
the
limits
of
a
dwarfish
French
bedstead
in
the
back
parlour
;
and
the
infantine
sports
and
gymnastic
exercises
of
Master
Bardell
were
exclusively
confined
to
the
neighbouring
pavements
and
gutters
.
 
<EOS>
Cleanliness
and
quiet
reigned
throughout
the
house
;
and
in
it
Mr
Pickwick
's
will
was
law
.
   
<EOS>
To
any
one
acquainted
with
these
points
of
the
domestic
economy
of
the
establishment
,
and
conversant
with
the
admirable
regulation
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
mind
,
his
appearance
and
behaviour
on
the
morning
previous
to
that
which
had
been
fixed
upon
for
the
journey
to
Eatanswill
would
have
been
most
mysterious
and
unaccountable
.
 
<EOS>
He
paced
the
room
to
and
fro
with
hurried
steps
,
popped
his
head
out
of
the
window
at
intervals
of
about
three
minutes
each
,
constantly
referred
to
his
watch
,
and
exhibited
many
other
manifestations
of
impatience
very
unusual
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
that
something
of
great
importance
was
in
contemplation
,
but
what
that
something
was
,
not
even
Mrs
Bardell
had
been
enabled
to
discover
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Bardell
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
at
last
,
as
that
amiable
female
approached
the
termination
of
a
prolonged
dusting
of
the
apartment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
little
boy
is
a
very
long
time
gone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
it
's
a
good
long
way
to
the
Borough
,
sir
,
"
remonstrated
Mrs
Bardell
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
very
true
;
so
it
is
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
relapsed
into
silence
,
and
Mrs
Bardell
resumed
her
dusting
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Bardell
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
at
the
expiration
of
a
few
minutes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
think
it
a
much
greater
expense
to
keep
two
people
,
than
to
keep
one
?
"
   
"
La
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
,
colouring
up
to
the
very
border
of
her
cap
,
as
she
fancied
she
observed
a
species
of
matrimonial
twinkle
in
the
eyes
of
her
lodger
;
"
La
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
what
a
question
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
depends
,
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
,
approaching
the
duster
very
near
to
Mr
Pickwick
's
elbow
which
was
planted
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
that
depends
a
good
deal
upon
the
person
,
you
know
,
Mr
Pickwick
;
and
whether
it
's
a
saving
and
careful
person
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
very
true
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
but
the
person
I
have
in
my
eye
(
here
he
looked
very
hard
at
Mrs
Bardell
)
<EOS>
I
think
possesses
these
qualities
;
and
has
,
moreover
,
a
considerable
knowledge
of
the
world
,
and
a
great
deal
of
sharpness
,
Mrs
Bardell
,
which
may
be
of
material
use
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
La

Mr
Pickwick

"
said
Mrs
Bardell
,
the
crimson
rising
to
her
cap
-
border
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
growing
energetic
,
as
was
his
wo
nt
in
speaking
of
a
subject
which
interested
him
---
"
I
do
,
indeed
;
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
Mrs
Bardell
,
I
have
made
up
my
mind
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
sir
,
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Bardell
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
think
it
very
strange
now
,
"
said
the
amiable
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
a
good
-
humoured
glance
at
his
companion
,
"
that
I
never
consulted
you
about
this
matter
,
and
never
even
mentioned
it
,
till
I
sent
your
little
boy
out
this
morning
---
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Bardell
could
only
reply
by
a
look
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
long
worshipped
Mr
Pickwick
at
a
distance
,
but
here
she
was
,
all
at
once
,
raised
to
a
pinnacle
to
which
her
wildest
and
most
extravagant
hopes
had
never
dared
to
aspire
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
going
to
propose
---
a
deliberate
plan
,
too
---
sent
her
little
boy
to
the
Borough
,
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
---
how
thoughtful
---
how
considerate
!
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
what
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
,
trembling
with
agitation
,
"
you
're
very
kind
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
'll
save
you
a
good
deal
of
trouble
,
wo
n't
it
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
never
thought
anything
of
the
trouble
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mrs
Bardell
;
"
and
,
of
course
,
I
should
take
more
trouble
to
please
you
then
,
than
ever
;
but
it
is
so
kind
of
you
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
to
have
so
much
consideration
for
my
loneliness
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
I
never
thought
of
that
.
<EOS>
When
I
am
in
town
,
you
'll
always
have
somebody
to
sit
with
you
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
so
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
ought
to
be
a
very
happy
woman
,
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
your
little
boy
---
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
his
heart
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Mrs
Bardell
,
with
a
maternal
sob
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
,
too
,
will
have
a
companion
,
"
resumed
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
a
lively
one
,
who
'll
teach
him
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
more
tricks
in
a
week
than
he
would
ever
learn
in
a
year
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
Mr
Pickwick
smiled
placidly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
dear
---
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
started
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
kind
,
good
,
playful
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
;
and
without
more
ado
,
she
rose
from
her
chair
,
and
flung
her
arms
round
Mr
Pickwick
's
neck
,
with
a
cataract
of
tears
and
a
chorus
of
sobs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
soul
,
"
cried
the
astonished
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
Mrs
Bardell
,
my
good
woman
---
<EOS>
dear
me
,
what
a
situation
---
pray
consider
.
<EOS>
---
Mrs
Bardell
,
do
n't
---
if
anybody
should
come
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
let
them
come
,
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Bardell
frantically
;
"
I
'll
never
leave
you
 
---
dear
,
kind
,
good
soul
;
"
and
,
with
these
words
,
Mrs
Bardell
clung
the
tighter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mercy
upon
me
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
struggling
violently
,
"
I
hear
somebody
coming
up
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
,
do
n't
,
there
's
a
good
creature
,
do
n't
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
entreaty
and
remonstrance
were
alike
unavailing
;
for
Mrs
Bardell
had
fainted
in
Mr
Pickwick
's
arms
;
and
before
he
could
gain
time
to
deposit
her
on
a
chair
,
Master
Bardell
entered
the
room
,
ushering
in
Mr
Tupman
,
Mr
Winkle
,
and
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
struck
motionless
and
speechless
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
with
his
lovely
burden
in
his
arms
,
gazing
vacantly
on
the
countenances
of
his
friends
,
without
the
slightest
attempt
at
recognition
or
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
They
,
in
their
turn
,
stared
at
him
;
and
Master
Bardell
,
in
his
turn
,
stared
at
everybody
.
   
<EOS>
The
astonishment
of
the
Pickwickians
was
so
absorbing
,
and
the
perplexity
of
Mr
Pickwick
was
so
extreme
,
that
they
might
have
remained
in
exactly
the
same
relative
situations
until
the
suspended
animation
of
the
lady
was
restored
,
had
it
not
been
for
a
most
beautiful
and
touching
expression
of
filial
affection
on
the
part
of
her
youthful
son
.
 
<EOS>
Clad
in
a
tight
suit
of
corduroy
,
spangled
with
brass
buttons
of
a
very
considerable
size
,
he
at
first
stood
at
the
door
astounded
and
uncertain
;
but
by
degrees
,
the
impression
that
his
mother
must
have
suffered
some
personal
damage
pervaded
his
partially
developed
mind
,
and
considering
Mr
Pickwick
as
the
aggressor
,
he
set
up
an
appalling
and
semi
-
earthly
kind
of
howling
,
and
butting
forward
with
his
head
,
commenced
assailing
that
immortal
gentleman
about
the
back
and
legs
,
with
such
blows
and
pinches
as
the
strength
of
his
arm
,
and
the
violence
of
his
excitement
,
allowed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
this
little
villain
away
,
"
said
the
agonised
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
he
's
mad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
said
the
three
tongue
-
tied
Pickwickians
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
pettishly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
away
the
boy
.
"
 
<EOS>
(
Here
Mr
Winkle
carried
the
interesting
boy
,
screaming
and
struggling
,
to
the
farther
end
of
the
apartment
.
)
<EOS>
"
Now
help
me
,
lead
this
woman
downstairs
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
am
better
now
,
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
faintly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
lead
you
downstairs
,
"
said
the
ever
-
gallant
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
---
thank
you
;
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Bardell
hysterically
.
<EOS>
And
downstairs
she
was
led
accordingly
,
accompanied
by
her
affectionate
son
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
conceive
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
when
his
friend
returned
---
"
I
can
not
conceive
what
has
been
the
matter
with
that
woman
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
merely
announced
to
her
my
intention
of
keeping
a
man
-
servant
,
when
she
fell
into
the
extraordinary
paroxysm
in
which
you
found
her
.
 
<EOS>
Very
extraordinary
thing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
,
"
said
his
three
friends
.
   
<EOS>
"
Placed
me
in
such
an
extremely
awkward
situation
,
"
continued
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
,
"
was
the
reply
of
his
followers
,
as
they
coughed
slightly
,
and
looked
dubiously
at
each
other
.
   
<EOS>
This
behaviour
was
not
lost
upon
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
He
remarked
their
incredulity
.
 
<EOS>
They
evidently
suspected
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
man
in
the
passage
now
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
man
I
spoke
to
you
about
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
I
sent
for
him
to
the
Borough
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Have
the
goodness
to
call
him
up
,
Snodgrass
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
did
as
he
was
desired
;
and
Mr
Samuel
Weller
forthwith
presented
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
---
you
remember
me
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
,
"
replied
Sam
,
with
a
patronising
wink
.
"
<EOS>
Queer
start
that
'
ere
,
but
he
was
one
too
many
for
you
,
warn't
he
?
 
<EOS>
Up
to
snuff
and
a
pinch
or
two
over
---
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
that
matter
now
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
hastily
;
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
about
something
else
.
 
<EOS>
Sit
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
sir
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
And
down
he
sat
without
further
bidding
,
having
previously
deposited
his
old
white
hat
on
the
landing
outside
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tain't
a
wery
good
'
un
to
look
at
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
but
<EOS>
it
's
an
astonishin
'
'
un
to
wear
;
and
afore
the
brim
went
,
it
was
a
wery
handsome
tile
.
 
<EOS>
Hows'ever
<EOS>
it
's
lighter
without
it
<EOS>
,
that
's
one
thing

and
every
hole
lets
in
some
air
<EOS>
,
that
's
another
 
---
wentilation
gossamer
<EOS>
I
calls
it

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
On
the
delivery
of
this
sentiment
,
Mr
Weller
smiled
agreeably
upon
the
assembled
Pickwickians
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
with
regard
to
the
matter
on
which
I
,
with
the
concurrence
of
these
gentlemen
,
sent
for
you
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
pint
,
sir
,
"
interposed
Sam
;
"
out
vith
it
,
as
the
father
said
to
his
child
,
when
he
swallowed
a
farden
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
want
to
know
,
in
the
first
place

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
whether
you
have
any
reason
to
be
discontented
with
your
present
situation

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Afore
<EOS>
I
answers

replied
Mr

,
"
I
should

first
place

whether
you

goin

"
   
<EOS>
A
sunbeam
of
placid
benevolence
played
on
Mr
Pickwick
's
features
as
he
said
,
"
I
have
half
made
up
my
mind
to
engage
you
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
,
though
?
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
nodded
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wages

"
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Twelve
pounds

replied
Mr

<EOS>
"
Clothes

<EOS>
"
Two

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
To

these
gentlemen

"
<EOS>
"
Take
the
bill
down

"
said
Sam
emphatically
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
let
to
a

the
terms

agreed
upon

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
accept

"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
"
Cert'nly

"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
the
clothes

half
as
well
as
the
place

they
'll
do

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
get
a
character

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ask
the
landlady
o

the
White
Hart
about
that

Sir

replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
you
come
this
evening

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
get
into

clothes
this

said
Sam
,
with
great
alacrity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Call
at
eight
this
evening

said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
and
if
the
inquiries
are
satisfactory
,
they
shall
be
provided

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
the
single
exception
of
one
amiable
indiscretion
,
in
which
an
assistant
housemaid
had
equally
participated
,
the
history
of
Mr
Weller
's
conduct
was
so
very
blameless
,
that
Mr
Pickwick
felt
fully
justified
in
closing
the
engagement
that
very
evening
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
promptness
and
energy
which
characterised
not
only
the
public
proceedings
,
but
all
the
private
actions
of
this
extraordinary
man
,
he
at
once
led
his
new
attendant
to
one
of
those
convenient
emporiums
where
gentlemen
's
new
and
second
-
hand
clothes
are
provided

and
the
troublesome
and
inconvenient
formality
of
measurement
dispensed
with
;
and
before
night
had
closed
in
,
Mr
Weller
was
furnished
with
a
grey
coat
with
the
P*C
button
,
a
black
hat
with
a
cockade
to
it
,
a
pink
striped
waistcoat
,
light
breeches
and
gaiters
,
and
a
variety
of
other
necessaries
,
too
numerous
to
recapitulate
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
that
suddenly
-
transformed
individual
,
as
he
took
his
seat
on
the
outside
of
the
Eatanswill
coach
next
morning
;
"
I
wonder
whether
I
'm
meant
to
be
a
footman
,
or
a
groom
,
or
a
gamekeeper
,
or
a
seedsman
.
 
<EOS>
I
looks
like
a
sort
of
compo
of
every
one
on
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
;
there
's
a
change
of
air
,
plenty
to
see
,
and
little
to
do
;
and
all
this
suits
my
complaint
uncommon
;
so
long
life
to
the
Pickvicks
,
says
I
!

<EOS>
Some
account
of
Eatanswill
;
of
the
state
of
parties
therein
;
and
of
the
election
of
a
member
to
serve
in
parliament
for
that
ancient
,
loyal
,
and
patriotic
borough
 
<EOS>
We
will
frankly
acknowledge
that
,
up
to
the
period
of
our
being
first
immersed
in
the
voluminous
papers
of
the
Pickwick
Club
,
we
had
never
heard
of
Eatanswill
;
we
will
with
equal
candour
admit
that
we
have
in
vain
searched
for
proof
of
the
actual
existence
of
such
a
place
at
the
present
day
.
 
<EOS>
Knowing
the
deep
reliance
to
be
placed
on
every
note
and
statement
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
,
and
not
presuming
to
set
up
our
recollection
against
the
recorded
declarations
of
that
great
man
,
we
have
consulted
every
authority
,
bearing
upon
the
subject
,
to
which
we
could
possibly
refer
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
traced
every
name
in
schedules
A
and
B
,
without
meeting
with
that
of
Eatanswill
;
we
have
minutely
examined
every
corner
of
the
pocket
county
maps
issued
for
the
benefit
of
society
by
our
distinguished
publishers
,
and
the
same
result
has
attended
our
investigation
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
therefore
led
to
believe
that
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
that
anxious
desire
to
abstain
from
giving
offence
to
any
,
and
with
those
delicate
feelings
for
which
all
who
knew
him
<EOS>
well
know
<EOS>
he
was
so
eminently
remarkable
,
purposely
substituted
a
fictitious
designation
,
for
the
real
name
of
the
place
in
which
his
observations
were
made
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
confirmed
in
this
belief
by
a
little
circumstance
,
apparently
slight
and
trivial
in
itself
,
but
when
considered
in
this
point
of
view
,
not
undeserving
of
notice
.
 
<EOS>
In
Mr
Pickwick
's
note
-
book
,
we
can
just
trace
an
entry
of
the
fact
,
that
the
places
of
himself
and
followers
were
booked
by
the
Norwich
coach
;
but
this
entry
was
afterwards
lined
through
,
as
if
for
the
purpose
of
concealing
even
the
direction
in
which
the
borough
is
situated
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
not
,
therefore
,
hazard
a
guess
upon
the
subject
,
but
will
at
once
proceed
with
this
history
,
content
with
the
materials
which
its
characters
have
provided
for
us
.
   
<EOS>
It
appears
,
then
,
that
the
Eatanswill
people
,
like
the
people
of
many
other
small
towns
,
considered
themselves
of
the
utmost
and
most
mighty
importance
,
and
that
every
man
in
Eatanswill
,
conscious
of
the
weight
that
attached
to
his
example
,
felt
himself
bound
to
unite
,
heart
and
soul
,
with
one
of
the
two
great
parties
that
divided
the
town
---
the
Blues
and
the
Buffs
.
 
<EOS>
Now
the
Blues
lost
no
opportunity
of
opposing
the
Buffs
,
and
the
Buffs
lost
no
opportunity
of
opposing
the
Blues
;
and
the
consequence
was
,
that
whenever
the
Buffs
and
Blues
met
together
at
public
meeting
,
town
-
hall
,
fair
,
or
market
,
disputes
and
high
words
arose
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
With
these
dissensions
it
is
almost
superfluous
to
say
that
everything
in
Eatanswill
was
made
a
party
question
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
Buffs
proposed
to
new
skylight
the
market
-
place
,
the
Blues
got
up
public
meetings
,
and
denounced
the
proceeding
;
if
the
Blues
proposed
the
erection
of
an
additional
pump
in
the
High
Street
,
the
Buffs
rose
as
one
man
and
stood
aghast
at
the
enormity
.
<EOS>
There
were
Blue
shops
and
Buff
shops
,
Blue
inns
and
Buff
inns
---
there
was
a
Blue
aisle
and
a
Buff
aisle
in
the
very
church
itself
.
   
<EOS>
Of
course
it
was
essentially
and
indispensably
necessary
that
each
of
these
powerful
parties
should
have
its
chosen
organ
and
representative
:
<EOS>
and
,
accordingly
,
there
were
two
newspapers
in
the
town
---
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
and
the
Eatanswill
INDEPENDENT
;
the
former
advocating
Blue
principles
,
and
the
latter
conducted
on
grounds
decidedly
Buff
.
 
<EOS>
Fine
newspapers
they
were
.
 
<EOS>
Such
leading
articles
,
and
such
spirited
attacks
!
---
<EOS>
"
Our
worthless
contemporary
,
the
GAZETTE
"
---
"
<EOS>
That
disgraceful
and
dastardly
journal
,
the
INDEPENDENT
"
---
"
That
false
and
scurrilous
print
,
the
INDEPENDENT
"
---
"
That
vile
and
slanderous
calumniator
,
the
GAZETTE
;
"
these
,
and
other
spirit
-
stirring
denunciations
,
were
strewn
plentifully
over
the
columns
of
each
,
in
every
number
,
and
excited
feelings
of
the
most
intense
delight
and
indignation
in
the
bosoms
of
the
townspeople
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
his
usual
foresight
and
sagacity
,
had
chosen
a
peculiarly
desirable
moment
for
his
visit
to
the
borough
.
 
<EOS>
Never
was
such
a
contest
known
.
 
<EOS>
The
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
,
of
Slumkey
Hall
,
was
the
Blue
candidate
;
and
Horatio
Fizkin
,
Esq
.
,
of
Fizkin
Lodge
,
near
Eatanswill
,
had
been
prevailed
upon
by
his
friends
to
stand
forward
on
the
Buff
interest
.
 
<EOS>
The
GAZETTE
warned
the
electors
of
Eatanswill
that
the
eyes
not
only
of
England
,
but
of
the
whole
civilised
world
,
were
upon
them
;
and
the
INDEPENDENT
imperatively
demanded
to
know
,
whether
the
constituency
of
Eatanswill
were
the
grand
fellows
they
had
always
taken
them
for
,
or
base
and
servile
tools
,
undeserving
alike
of
the
name
of
Englishmen
and
the
blessings
of
freedom
.
 
<EOS>
Never
had
such
a
commotion
agitated
the
town
before
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
late
in
the
evening
when
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
companions
,
assisted
by
Sam
,
dismounted
from
the
roof
of
the
Eatanswill
coach
.
 
<EOS>
Large
blue
silk
flags
were
flying
from
the
windows
of
the
Town
Arms
Inn
,
and
bills
were
posted
in
every
sash
,
intimating
,
in
gigantic
letters
,
that
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
's
committee
sat
there
daily
.
 
<EOS>
A
crowd
of
idlers
were
assembled
in
the
road
,
looking
at
a
hoarse
man
in
the
balcony
,
who
was
apparently
talking
himself
very
red
in
the
face
in
Mr
Slumkey
's
behalf
;
but
the
force
and
point
of
whose
arguments
were
somewhat
impaired
by
the
perpetual
beating
of
four
large
drums
which
Mr
Fizkin
's
committee
had
stationed
at
the
street
corner
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
busy
little
man
beside
him
,
though
,
who
took
off
his
hat
at
intervals
and
motioned
to
the
people
to
cheer
,
which
they
regularly
did
,
most
enthusiastically
;
and
as
the
red
-
faced
gentleman
went
on
talking
till
he
was
redder
in
the
face
than
ever
<EOS>
,
it
seemed
to
answer
his
purpose
quite
as
well
as
if
anybody
had
heard
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
Pickwickians
had
no
sooner
dismounted
than
they
were
surrounded
by
a
branch
mob
of
the
honest
and
independent
,
who
forthwith
set
up
three
deafening
cheers
,
which
being
responded
to
by
the
main
body
<EOS>
(
for
it
's
not
at
all
necessary
for
a
crowd
to
know
what
they
are
cheering
about
)
,
swelled
into
a
tremendous
roar
of
triumph
,
which
stopped
even
the
red
-
faced
man
in
the
balcony
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hurrah
!
"
shouted
the
mob
,
in
conclusion
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
cheer
more
,
"
screamed
the
little
fugleman
in
the
balcony
,
and
out
shouted
the
mob
again
,
as
if
lungs
were
cast
-
iron
,
with
steel
works
.
   
<EOS>
"
Slumkey
for
ever
!
"
<EOS>
roared
the
honest
and
independent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Slumkey
for
ever
!
"
echoed
Mr
Pickwick
,
taking
off
his
hat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
Fizkin
!
"
roared
the
crowd
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
!
"
shouted
Mr
Pickwick
.
"
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
"
<EOS>
And
then
there
was
another
roaring
,
like
that
of
a
whole
menagerie
when
the
elephant
has
rung
the
bell
for
the
cold
meat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
is
Slumkey
?
"
whispered
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
in
the
same
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
ask
any
questions
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
always
best
on
these
occasions
to
do
what
the
mob
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
suppose
there
are
two
mobs
?
"
suggested
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shout
with
the
largest
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
Volumes
could
not
have
said
more
.
   
<EOS>
They
entered
the
house
,
the
crowd
opening
right
and
left
to
let
them
pass
,
and
cheering
vociferously
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
object
of
consideration
was
to
secure
quarters
for
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
we
have
beds
here
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
,
summoning
the
waiter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
know
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
man
;
"
afraid
we
're
full
,
sir
---
I
'll
inquire
,
Sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
Away
he
went
for
that
purpose
,
and
presently
returned
,
to
ask
whether
the
gentleman
were
"
Blue
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
neither
Mr
Pickwick
nor
his
companions
took
any
vital
interest
in
the
cause
of
either
candidate
,
the
question
was
rather
a
difficult
one
to
answer
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
dilemma
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
bethought
himself
of
his
new
friend
,
Mr
Perker
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
Perker
?
"
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
Sir
;
Honourable
Mr
Samuel
Slumkey
's
agent
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
Blue
,
I
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
WE
are
Blue
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
but
observing
that
the
man
looked
rather
doubtful
at
this
accommodating
announcement
,
he
gave
him
his
card
,
and
desired
him
to
present
it
to
Mr
Perker
forthwith
,
if
he
should
happen
to
be
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
waiter
retired
;
and
reappearing
almost
immediately
with
a
request
that
Mr
Pickwick
would
follow
him
,
led
the
way
to
a
large
room
on
the
first
floor
,
where
,
seated
at
a
long
table
covered
with
books
and
papers
,
was
Mr
Perker
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
---
ah
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
said
the
little
man
,
advancing
to
meet
him
;
"
very
happy
to
see
you
,
my
dear
Sir
,
very
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
sit
down
.
<EOS>
So
you
have
carried
your
intention
into
effect
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
come
down
here
to
see
an
election
---
eh
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
Spirited
contest
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
said
the
little
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
delighted
to
hear
it
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
rubbing
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
like
to
see
sturdy
patriotism
,
on
whatever
side
it
is
called
forth
---
and
so
it
's
a
spirited
contest
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
said
the
little
man
,
"
very
much
so
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
opened
all
the
public
-
houses
in
the
place
,
and
left
our
adversary
nothing
but
the
beer
-
shops
-
masterly
stroke
of
policy
that
,
my
dear
Sir
,
eh
?
"
 
The
little
man
smiled
complacently
,
and
took
a
large
pinch
of
snuff
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
are
the
probabilities
as
to
the
result
of
the
contest
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
doubtful
,
my
dear
Sir
;
rather
doubtful
as
yet
,
"
replied
the
little
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fizkin
's
people
have
got
three
-
and
-
thirty
voters
in
the
lock
-
up
coach
-
house
at
the
White
Hart
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
coach
-
house
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
considerably
astonished
by
this
second
stroke
of
policy
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
keep
'em
locked
up
there
till
they
want
'
em
,
"
resumed
the
little
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
effect
of
that
is
,
you
see
,
to
prevent
our
getting
at
them
;
and
even
if
we
could
,
it
would
be
of
no
use
,
for
they
keep
them
very
drunk
on
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Smart
fellow
Fizkin
's
agent
---
very
smart
fellow
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
stared
,
but
said
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
pretty
confident
,
though
,
"
said
Mr
Perker
,
sinking
his
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
had
a
little
tea
-
party
here
,
last
night
---
<EOS>
five
-
and
-
forty
women
,
my
dear
sir

and
gave
every
one
of
'em
<EOS>
a
green
parasol
<EOS>
when
she
went
away

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A

said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fact

fact

Five

forty
green
parasols

at
seven

sixpence

All

"
   
<EOS>
Here
the
little
man
indulged
in
a
convulsion
of
mirth
,
which
was
only
checked
by
the
entrance
of
a
third
party
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
a
tall
,
thin
man
,
with
a
sandy
-
coloured
head
inclined
to
baldness
,
and
a
face
in
which
solemn
importance
was
blended
with
a
look
of
unfathomable
profundity
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
a
long
brown
surtout
,
with
a
black
cloth
waistcoat
,
and
drab
trousers
.
 
<EOS>
A
double
eyeglass
dangled
at
his
waistcoat
;
and
on
his
head
he
wore
a
very
low
-
crowned
hat
with
a
broad
brim
.
<EOS>
The
new
-
comer
was
introduced
to
Mr
Pickwick
as
Mr
Pott
,
the
editor
of
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
few
preliminary
remarks
,
Mr
Pott
turned
round
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
said
with
solemnity
---
   
<EOS>
"
This
contest
excites
great
interest
in
the
metropolis
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
does
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
which
I
have
reason
to
know
,
"
said
Pott
,
looking
towards
Mr
Perker
for
corroboration
---
"
<EOS>
to
which
I
have
reason
to
know
that
my
article
of
last
Saturday
in
some
degree
contributed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
the
least
doubt
of
it
,
"
said
the
little
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
press
is
a
mighty
engine
,
sir
,
"
said
Pott
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
yielded
his
fullest
assent
to
the
proposition
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
trust
,
sir
,
"
said
Pott
,
"
that
I
have
never
abused
the
enormous
power
I
wield
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
,
sir
,
that
I
have
never
pointed
the
noble
instrument
which
is
placed
in
my
hands
,
against
the
sacred
bosom
of
private
life
,
or
the
tender
breast
of
individual
reputation
;
I
trust
,
sir
,
that
I
have
devoted
my
energies
to
---
to
endeavours

<EOS>
humble
they
may
be
,
<EOS>
humble
<EOS>
I
know
they

those

"
   
Here
the
editor
of
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
,
appearing
to
ramble
,
Mr
Pickwick
came
to
his
relief
,
and
said
---
   
"
Certainly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
,
Sir
,
"
said
Pott
---
"
what
,
Sir
,
let
me
ask
you
as
an
impartial
man
,
is
the
state
of
the
public
mind
in
London
,
with
reference
to
my
contest
with
the
INDEPENDENT
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Greatly
excited
,
no
doubt
,
"
interposed
Mr
Perker
,
with
a
look
of
slyness
which
was
very
likely
accidental
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
contest
,
"
said
Pott
,
"
shall
be
prolonged
so
long
as
I
have
health
and
strength
,
and
that
portion
of
talent
with
which
I
am
gifted
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
contest
,
Sir
,
although
it
may
unsettle
men
's
minds
and
excite
their
feelings
,
and
render
them
incapable
for
the
discharge
of
the
everyday
duties
of
ordinary
life
;
from
that
contest
,
sir
,
I
will
never
shrink
,
till
I
have
set
my
heel
upon
the
Eatanswill
INDEPENDENT
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
the
people
of
London
,
and
the
people
of
this
country
to
know
,
sir
,
that
they
may
rely
upon
me
 
---
that
I
will
not
desert
them
,
that
I
am
resolved
to
stand
by
them
,
Sir
,
to
the
last
.
"
<EOS>
"
Your
conduct
is
most
noble
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
and
he
grasped
the
hand
of
the
magnanimous
Pott
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
,
sir
,
I
perceive
,
a
man
of
sense
and
talent
,
"
said
Mr
Pott
,
almost
breathless
with
the
vehemence
of
his
patriotic
declaration
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
most
happy
,
sir
,
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
such
a
man
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
feel
deeply
honoured
by
this
expression
of
your
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
Allow
me
,
sir
,
to
introduce
you
to
my
fellow
-
travellers
,
the
other
corresponding
members
of
the
club
I
am
proud
to
have
founded
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
delighted
,
"
said
Mr
Pott
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
withdrew
,
and
returning
with
his
friends
,
presented
them
in
due
form
to
the
editor
of
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
dear
Pott
,
"
said
little
Mr
Perker
,
"
the
question
is
,
what
are
we
to
do
with
our
friends
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
can
stop
in
this
house
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
spare
bed
in
the
house
,
my
dear
sir
---
not
a
single
bed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Extremely
awkward
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
,
"
said
his
fellow
-
voyagers
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
an
idea
upon
this
subject
,
"
said
Mr
Pott
,
"
which
I
think
may
be
very
successfully
adopted
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
two
beds
at
the
Peacock
,
and
I
can
boldly
say
,
on
behalf
of
Mrs
Pott
,
that
she
will
be
delighted
to
accommodate
Mr
Pickwick
and
any
one
of
his
friends
,
if
the
other
two
gentlemen
and
their
servant
do
not
object
to
shifting
,
as
they
best
can
,
at
the
Peacock
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
repeated
pressings
on
the
part
of
Mr
Pott
,
and
repeated
protestations
on
that
of
Mr
Pickwick
that
he
could
not
think
of
incommoding
or
troubling
his
amiable
wife
,
it
was
decided
that
it
was
the
only
feasible
arrangement
that
could
be
made
.
 
<EOS>
So
it
WAS
made
;
and
after
dinner
together
at
the
Town
Arms
,
the
friends
separated
,
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
and
Mr
Snodgrass
repairing
to
the
Peacock
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Winkle
<EOS>
proceeding
to
the
mansion
of
Mr
Pott
;
it
having
been
previously
arranged
that
they
should
all
reassemble
at
the
Town
Arms
in
the
morning
,
and
accompany
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
's
procession
to
the
place
of
nomination
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pott
's
domestic
circle
was
limited
to
himself
and
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
All
men
whom
mighty
genius
has
raised
to
a
proud
eminence
in
the
world
,
have
usually
some
little
weakness
which
appears
the
more
conspicuous
from
the
contrast
it
presents
to
their
general
character
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mr
Pott
had
a
weakness
,
it
was
,
perhaps
,
that
he
was
rather
too
submissive
to
the
somewhat
contemptuous
control
and
sway
of
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
not
feel
justified
in
laying
any
particular
stress
upon
the
fact
,
because
on
the
present
occasion
all
Mrs
Pott
's
most
winning
ways
were
brought
into
requisition
to
receive
the
two
gentlemen
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Pott
,
"
Mr
Pickwick
---
Mr
Pickwick
of
London
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Pott
received
Mr
Pickwick
's
paternal
grasp
of
the
hand
with
enchanting
sweetness
;
and
Mr
Winkle
,
who
had
not
been
announced
at
all
,
sidled
and
bowed
,
unnoticed
,
in
an
obscure
corner
.
   
<EOS>
"
P
my
dear

said
Mrs
Pott
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My

said
Mr
Pott

<EOS>
"
Pray

other

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
a
thousand
pardons

Mr
Pott

<EOS>
"
Permit
me

"
Winkle

said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Winkle
,
"
echoed
Mr
Pott
;
and
the
ceremony
of
introduction
was
complete
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
owe
you
many
apologies
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
for
disturbing
your
domestic
arrangements
at
so
short
a
notice
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
you
wo
n't
mention
it
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
feminine
Pott
,
with
vivacity
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
high
treat
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
to
see
any
new
faces
;
living
as
I
do
,
from
day
to
day
,
and
week

,
in
this
dull
place
,
and
seeing
nobody
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nobody

my
dear

"
exclaimed
Mr
Pott
archly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nobody
but
you
,
"
retorted
Mrs
Pott
,
with
asperity
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
said
the
host
in
explanation
of
his
wife
's
lament
,
"
that
we
are
in
some
measure
cut
off
from
many
enjoyments
and
pleasures
of
which
we
might
otherwise
partake
.
<EOS>
My
public
station
,
as
editor
of
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
,
the
position
which
that
paper
holds
in
the
country
,
my
constant
immersion
in
the
vortex
of
politics

interposed
Mrs
Pott
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

said
the
editor
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
my
dear
,
you
would
endeavour
to
find
some
topic
of
conversation
in
which
these
gentlemen
might
take
some
rational
interest
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
love

"
said
Mr
Pott
,
with
great
humility
,
"
Mr
Pickwick
does
take
an
interest
in
it

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
well
for
him
if
he
can

"
said
Mrs
Pott
emphatically
;
<EOS>
"
I
am
wearied
out
of
my
life
with
your
politics
,
and
quarrels
with
the
INDEPENDENT
,
and
nonsense

<EOS>
I
am
quite
astonished
,
P

at
your
making
such
an
exhibition
of
your
absurdity

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
But

said
Mr

.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

nonsense

do

said
Mrs

.
 
<EOS>
"
Do

play
ecarte

Sir

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
very
happy
to
learn
under
your
tuition

"
replied
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
draw
that
little
table
into
this
window
,
and
let
me
get
out
of
hearing
of
those
prosy
politics
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
"
said
Mr
Pott
,
to
the
servant
who
brought
in
candles
,
"
go
down
into
the
office
,
and
bring
me
up
the
file
of
the
GAZETTE
for
eighteen
hundred
and
twenty

six
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
read
you
,
"
added
the
editor
,
turning
to
Mr
Pickwick
---
"
I
'll
just
read
you
a
few
of
the
leaders
I
wrote
at
that
time
upon
the
Buff
job
of
appointing
a
new
tollman
to
the
turnpike
here
;
I
rather
think
they
'll
amuse
you

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
hear
them
very
much
indeed

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
Up
came
the
file
,
and
down
sat
the
editor
,
with
Mr
Pickwick
at
his
side
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
in
vain
pored
over
the
leaves
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
note
-
book
,
in
the
hope
of
meeting
with
a
general
summary
of
these
beautiful
compositions
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
was
perfectly
enraptured
with
the
vigour
and
freshness
of
the
style
;
indeed
Mr
Winkle
has
recorded
the
fact
that
his
eyes
were
closed
,
as
if
with
excess
of
pleasure
,
during
the
whole
time
of
their
perusal
.
   
<EOS>
The
announcement
of
supper
put
a
stop
both
to
the
game
of
ecarte
,
and
the
recapitulation
of
the
beauties
of
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Pott
was
in
the
highest
spirits
and
the
most
agreeable
humour
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
had
already
made
considerable
progress
in
her
good
opinion
,
and
she
did
not
hesitate
to
inform
him
,
confidentially
,
that
Mr
Pickwick
was
"
a
delightful
old
dear
.
<EOS>
"
These
terms
convey
a
familiarity
of
expression
,
in
which
few
of
those
who
were
intimately
acquainted
with
that
colossal
-
minded
man
,
would
have
presumed
to
indulge
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
preserved
them
,
nevertheless
,
as
affording
at
once
a
touching
and
a
convincing
proof
of
the
estimation
in
which
he
was
held
by
every
class
of
society
,
and
the
case
with
which
he
made
his
way
to
their
hearts
and
feelings
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
late
hour
of
the
night
---
long
after
Mr
Tupman
and
Mr
Snodgrass
had
fallen
asleep
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
the
Peacock
---
when
the
two
friends
retired
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Slumber
soon
fell
upon
the
senses
of
Mr
Winkle
,
but
his
feelings
had
been
excited
,
and
his
admiration
roused
;
and
for
many
hours
after
sleep
had
rendered
him
insensible
to
earthly
objects
,
the
face
and
figure
of
the
agreeable
Mrs
Pott
presented
themselves
again
and
again
to
his
wandering
imagination
.
   
<EOS>
The
noise
and
bustle
which
ushered
in
the
morning
were
sufficient
to
dispel
from
the
mind
of
the
most
romantic
visionary
in
existence
,
any
associations
but
those
which
were
immediately
connected
with
the
rapidly
-
approaching
election
.
 
<EOS>
The
beating
of
drums
,
the
blowing
of
horns
and
trumpets
,
the
shouting
of
men
,
and
tramping
of
horses
,
echoed
and
re
---
echoed
through
the
streets
from
the
earliest
dawn
of
day
;
and
an
occasional
fight
between
the
light
skirmishers
of
either
party
at
once
enlivened
the
preparations
,
and
agreeably
diversified
their
character
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Sam

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
his
valet
appeared
at
his
bedroom
door
,
just
as
he
was
concluding
his
toilet
;
"
all
alive
to

day

I
suppose
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Reg'lar

replied
Mr

"

Ah

Mr

Never

said
Mr

<EOS>
"
Uncommon

said
Mr

replied
Sam
briefly

<EOS>
"
Fine

said
Mr
Pickwick
,
glancing
from
the
window

<EOS>
"
Wery

replied
Sam
;

the
astonished
Mr

<EOS>
"
Lord

Mr

Nothin'

"
The
night
afore

<EOS>
o

<EOS>
the

here
<EOS>
,
the

bribed
the

at

Arms
,
to
hocus
the
brandy

water
of
fourteen

What

Mr

Blessed

send
'em
all
to

till
twelve
hours
arter

<EOS>
They
took
one
man
up
to
the
booth

in

truck
,
fast
asleep
,
by
way
of
experiment

but
it
was
no

they
would

poll
him

so
they
brought

put
him
to

"
<EOS>
"
Strange
practices
,
these
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
half
speaking
to
himself
and
half
addressing
Sam
<EOS>
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
half
so
strange
as
a
miraculous
circumstance
as
happened
to
my
own
father
,
at
an
election
time
,
in
this
wery
place
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
was
that
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
he
drove
a
coach
down
here
once
,
"
said
Sam
;
"
'
lection
time
came
on
,
and
he
was
engaged
by
vun
party
to
bring
down
woters
from
London
.
 
<EOS>
Night
afore
he
was
going
to
drive
up
,
<EOS>
committee
on
t
"
other
side
sends
for
him
quietly
,
and
away
he
goes
vith
the
messenger
,
who
shows
him
in
;
<EOS>
---
large
room
---
lots
of
gen'l'm'n

heaps
of
papers
,
pens

,
and
all
that
'

.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Mr

,
"
says
the
gen'l'm'n
in
the
chair
,
"
glad
to
see

how
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
---
"
Wery

says
my

I

<EOS>

"
Pretty

;
"
sit
down

Mr

pray
sit
down

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
my
father
sits
down
,
and
he
and
the
gen'l'm'n
looks
wery
hard
at
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
remember
me
?
"
said
the
gen'l'm'n
.
<EOS>
---
"
Ca
n't
say
I
do
,
"
says
my
father
.
<EOS>
---
"
Oh
,
I
know
you
,
"
says
the
gen'l'm'n
:
"
know'd
you
when
you

a

,
"
says
he
.
<EOS>
---
"
Well
,
I
do
n't

you
,
"
says
my

.
<EOS>
---
"
That
's
wery
odd
,
"
says
the
gen'l'm'n
.
<EOS>
"
---
"
Wery
,
"
says
my

.
<EOS>
---
"
You
must
have
a

Mr

says
the
gen'l'm'n

<EOS>

"
Well
,
it
is
a

bad

,
"
says
my
father
.
<EOS>
---
"
I
thought
so
,
"
says
the
gen'l'm'n
.
 
<EOS>
So
then
they
pours
him
out
a
glass
of
wine
,
and
gammons
him
about
his
driving
,
and
gets
him
into
a
reg'lar
good
humour
,
and
at
last
shoves
a
twenty

pound
note
into
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
wery
bad
road
between
this

London

"
says
the
gen'l'm'n
.
<EOS>
---
"
Here
and
there
it
is
a
heavy
road

"
says
my
father
.
<EOS>
---
"
"
Specially
near
the
canal

I
think
,
"
says
the
gen'l'm'n
.
<EOS>
---
"
Nasty

says
my

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Well

should
tip

this

for

"
says
he
.
<EOS>
---
"
Gen'l'm'n
,
you
're
wery
kind
,
"
says
my
father
,
"
and
I
'll
drink
your
health
in
another
glass
of
wine
,
"
says
he
;
vich
he
did
,
and
then
buttons
up
the
money
,
and
bows
himself
out
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
n't
believe
,
sir

"
continued
Sam
,
with
a
look
of
inexpressible
impudence
at
his
master
,
"
that
on
the
wery
day
as
he
came
down
with
them
woters
,
his
coach
WAS
upset
on
that
'
ere
wery
spot
,
and
ev'ry
man
on
'em
was
turned
into
the
canal
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
got
out
again
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
hastily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
replied
Sam
very
slowly
,
"
I
rather
think
one
old
gen'l'm'n
was
missin
'
;
<EOS>
I
know
his
hat
was
found
,
but
I
ai
n't
quite
certain
whether
his
head
was
in
it
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
I
look
at
is
the
hex
-
traordinary
and
wonderful
coincidence
,
<EOS>
that
arter
what
that
gen'l'm'n
said
,
my
father
's
coach
should
be
upset
in
that
wery
place
,
and
on
that
wery
day
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
it
is
,
no
doubt
,
a
very
extraordinary
circumstance
indeed
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
brush
my
hat
,
Sam
,
for
I
hear
Mr
Winkle
calling
me
to
breakfast
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
Mr
Pickwick
descended
to
the
parlour
,
where
he
found
breakfast
laid
,
and
the
family
already
assembled
.
<EOS>
The
meal
was
hastily
despatched
;
each
of
the
gentlemen
's
hats
was
decorated
with
an
enormous
blue
favour
,
made
up
by
the
fair
hands
of
Mrs
Pott
herself
;
and
as
Mr
Winkle
had
undertaken
to
escort
that
lady
to
a
house
-
top
,
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
hustings
,
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Pott
repaired
alone
to
the
Town
Arms
,
from
the
back
window
of
which
,
one
of
Mr
Slumkey
's
committee
was
addressing
six
small
boys
and
one
girl
,
whom
he
dignified
,
at
every
second
sentence
,
with
the
imposing
title
of
"
Men
of
Eatanswill
,
"
whereat
<EOS>
the
six
small
boys
aforesaid
cheered
prodigiously
.
   
<EOS>
The
stable
-
yard
exhibited
unequivocal
symptoms
of
the
glory
and
strength
of
the
Eatanswill
Blues
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
regular
army
of
blue
flags
,
some
with
one
handle
,
and
some
with
two
,
exhibiting
appropriate
devices
,
in
golden
characters
four
feet
high
,
and
stout
in
proportion
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
grand
band
of
trumpets
,
bassoons
,
and
drums
,
marshalled
four
abreast
,
and
earning
their
money
,
if
ever
men
did
,
especially
the
drum
-
beaters
,
who
were
very
muscular
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
bodies
of
constables
with
blue
staves
,
twenty
committee
-
men
with
blue
scarfs
,
and
a
mob
of
voters
with
blue
cockades
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
electors
on
horseback
and
electors
afoot
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
open
carriage
-
and
-
four
,
for
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
;
and
there
were
four
carriage
-
and
-
pair
,
for
his
friends
and
supporters
;
and
the
flags
were
rustling
,
and
the
band
was
playing
,
and
the
constables
were
swearing
,
and
the
twenty
committee
-
men
were
squabbling
,
and
the
mob
were
shouting
,
and
the
horses
were
backing
,
and
the
post
-
boys
perspiring
;
and
everybody
,
and
everything
,
then
and
there
assembled
,
was
for
the
special
use
,
behoof
,
honour
,
and
renown
,
of
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
,
of
Slumkey
Hall
,
one
of
the
candidates
for
the
representation
of
the
borough
of
Eatanswill
,
in
the
Commons
House
of
Parliament
of
the
United
Kingdom
.
<EOS>
Loud
and
long
were
the
cheers
,
and
mighty
was
the
rustling
of
one
of
the
blue
flags
,
with
"
Liberty
of
the
Press
"
inscribed
thereon
,
when
the
sandy
head
of
Mr
Pott
was
discerned
in
one
of
the
windows
,
by
the
mob
beneath
;
and
tremendous
was
the
enthusiasm
when
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
himself
,
in
top
-
boots
,
and
a
blue
neckerchief
,
advanced
and
seized
the
hand
of
the
said
Pott
,
and
melodramatically
testified
by
gestures
to
the
crowd
,
his
ineffaceable
obligations
to
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
everything
ready
?
"
said
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
to
Mr
Perker
.
   
<EOS>
"
Everything
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
was
the
little
man
's
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
has
been
omitted
,
I
hope
?
"
said
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
has
been
left
undone
,
my
dear
sir
---
nothing
whatever
.
<EOS>
There
are
twenty
washed
men
at
the
street
door
for
you
to
shake
hands
with
;
and
six
children
in
arms
that
you
're
to
pat
on
the
head
,
and
inquire
the
age
of
;
be
particular
about
the
children
,
my
dear
sir
---
it
has
always
a
great
effect
,
that
sort
of
thing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
care
,
"
said
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
,
perhaps
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
said
the
cautious
little
man
,
"
perhaps
if
you
could
---
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
it
's
indispensable
---
but
if
you
could
manage
to
kiss
one
of
'em
,
it
would
produce
a
very
great
impression
on
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Would
n't
it
have
as
good
an
effect
if
the
proposer
or
seconder
did
that
?
"
said
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
am
afraid
it
would
n't
,
"
replied
the
agent
;
"
if
it
were
done
by
yourself
,
my
dear
Sir
,
I
think
it
would
make
you
very
popular
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
,
with
a
resigned
air
,
"
then
it
must
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Arrange
the
procession
,
"
cried
the
twenty
committee
-
men
.
   
<EOS>
Amidst
the
cheers
of
the
assembled
throng
,
the
band
,
and
the
constables
,
and
the
committee
-
men
,
and
the
voters
,
and
the
horsemen
,
and
the
carriages
,
took
their
places
---
each
of
the
two
-
horse
vehicles
being
closely
packed
with
as
many
gentlemen
as
could
manage
to
stand
upright
in
it
;
and
that
assigned
to
Mr
Perker
,
containing
Mr
Pickwick
,
Mr
Tupman
,
Mr
Snodgrass
,
and
about
half
a
dozen
of
the
committee
besides
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
moment
of
awful
suspense
as
the
procession
waited
for
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
to
step
into
his
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
the
crowd
set
up
a
great
cheering
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
come
out
,
"
said
little
Mr
Perker
,
greatly
excited
;
the
more
so
as
their
position
did
not
enable
them
to
see
what
was
going
forward
.
   
<EOS>
Another
cheer
,
much
louder
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
shaken
hands
with
the
men
,
"
cried
the
little
agent
.
   
<EOS>
Another
cheer
,
far
more
vehement
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
patted
the
babies
on
the
head
,
"
said
Mr
Perker
,
trembling
with
anxiety
.
   
<EOS>
A
roar
of
applause
that
rent
the
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
kissed
one
of
'
em
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
delighted
little
man
.
   
<EOS>
A
second
roar
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
kissed
another
,
"
gasped
the
excited
manager
.
   
<EOS>
A
third
roar
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
kissing
'em
all
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
the
enthusiastic
little
gentleman
,
and
hailed
by
the
deafening
shouts
of
the
multitude
,
the
procession
moved
on
.
   
<EOS>
How
or
by
what
means
it
became
mixed
up
with
the
other
procession
,
and
how
it
was
ever
extricated
from
the
confusion
consequent
thereupon
,
is
more
than
we
can
undertake
to
describe
,
inasmuch
as
Mr
Pickwick
's
hat
was
knocked
over
his
eyes
,
nose
,
and
mouth
,
by
one
poke
of
a
Buff
flag
-
staff
,
very
early
in
the
proceedings
.
 
<EOS>
He
describes
himself
as
being
surrounded
on
every
side
,
when
he
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
scene
,
by
angry
and
ferocious
countenances
,
by
a
vast
cloud
of
dust
,
and
by
a
dense
crowd
of
combatants
.
 
<EOS>
He
represents
himself
as
being
forced
from
the
carriage
by
some
unseen
power
,
and
being
personally
engaged
in
a
pugilistic
encounter
;
but
with
whom
,
or
how
,
or
why
,
he
is
wholly
unable
to
state
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
felt
himself
forced
up
some
wooden
steps
by
the
persons
from
behind
;
and
on
removing
his
hat
,
found
himself
surrounded
by
his
friends
,
in
the
very
front
of
the
left
hand
side
of
the
hustings
.
 
<EOS>
The
right
was
reserved
for
the
Buff
party
,
and
the
centre
for
the
mayor
and
his
officers
;
one
of
whom
---
the
fat
crier
of
Eatanswill
---
was
ringing
an
enormous
bell
,
by
way
of
commanding
silence
,
while
Mr
Horatio
Fizkin
,
and
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
,
with
their
hands
upon
their
hearts
,
were
bowing
with
the
utmost
affability
to
the
troubled
sea
of
heads
that
inundated
the
open
space
in
front
;
and
from
whence
arose
a
storm
of
groans
,
and
shouts
,
and
yells
,
and
hootings
,
that
would
have
done
honour
to
an
earthquake
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
Winkle
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
pulling
his
friend
by
the
sleeve
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
putting
on
his
spectacles
,
which
he
had
fortunately
kept
in
his
pocket
hitherto
.
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
"
on
the
top
of
that
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
there
,
sure
enough
,
in
the
leaden
gutter
of
a
tiled
roof
,
were
Mr
Winkle
and
Mrs
Pott
,
comfortably
seated
in
a
couple
of
chairs
,
waving
their
handkerchiefs
in
token
of
recognition
---
a
compliment
which
Mr
Pickwick
returned
by
kissing
his
hand
to
the
lady
.
   
<EOS>
The
proceedings
had
not
yet
commenced
;
and
as
an
inactive
crowd
is
generally
disposed
to
be
jocose
,
this
very
innocent
action
was
sufficient
to
awaken
their
facetiousness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
wicked
old
rascal
,
"
cried
one
voice
,
"
looking
arter
the
girls
,
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
wenerable
sinner
,
"
cried
another
.
   
<EOS>
"
Putting
on
his
spectacles
to
look
at
a
married
"
ooman
!
"
said
a
third
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
a
-
winkin
'
at
her
,
with
his
wicked
old
eye
,
"
shouted
a
fourth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
arter
your
wife
,
Pott
,
"
bellowed
a
fifth
---
and
then
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
.
   
<EOS>
As
these
taunts
were
accompanied
with
invidious
comparisons
between
Mr
Pickwick
and
an
aged
ram
,
and
several
witticisms
of
the
like
nature
;
and
as
they
moreover
rather
tended
to
convey
reflections
upon
the
honour
of
an
innocent
lady
,
Mr
Pickwick
's
indignation
was
excessive
;
but
as
silence
was
proclaimed
at
the
moment
,
he
contented
himself
by
scorching
the
mob
with
a
look
of
pity
for
their
misguided
minds
,
at
which
they
laughed
more
boisterously
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
"
Silence
!
"
<EOS>
roared
the
mayor
's
attendants
.
   
<EOS>
"
Whiffin
,
proclaim
silence
,
"
said
the
mayor
,
with
an
air
of
pomp
befitting
his
lofty
station
.
 
<EOS>
In
obedience
to
this
command
the
crier
performed
another
concerto
on
the
bell
,
whereupon
<EOS>
a
gentleman
in
the
crowd
called
out
"
Muffins
"
;
which
occasioned
another
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
said
the
mayor
,
at
as
loud
a
pitch
as
he
could
possibly
force
his
voice
to
---
"
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
Brother
electors
of
the
borough
of
Eatanswill
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
met
here
to
-
day
for
the
purpose
of
choosing
a
representative
in
the
room
of
our
late
---
"
   
<EOS>
Here
the
mayor
was
interrupted
by
a
voice
in
the
crowd
.
   
<EOS>
"
Suc
-
cess
to
the
mayor
!
"
cried
the
voice
,
"
and
may
he
never
desert
the
nail
and
sarspan
business
,
as
he
got
his
money
by
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
allusion
to
the
professional
pursuits
of
the
orator
was
received
with
a
storm
of
delight
,
which
,
with
a
bell
-
accompaniment
,
rendered
the
remainder
of
his
speech
inaudible
,
with
the
exception
of
the
concluding
sentence
,
in
which
he
thanked
the
meeting
for
the
patient
attention
with
which
they
heard
him
throughout
---
an
expression
of
gratitude
which
elicited
another
burst
of
mirth
,
of
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
duration
.
   
<EOS>
Next
,
a
tall
,
thin
gentleman
,
in
a
very
stiff
white
neckerchief
,
after
being
repeatedly
desired
by
the
crowd
to
"
send
a
boy
home
,
to
ask
whether
he
had
n't
left
his
voice
under
the
pillow
,
"
begged
to
nominate
a
fit
and
proper
person
to
represent
them
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
And
when
he
said
it
was
Horatio
Fizkin
,
Esquire
,
of
Fizkin
Lodge
,
near
Eatanswill
,
the
Fizkinites
applauded
,
and
the
Slumkeyites
groaned
,
so
long
,
and
so
loudly
,
that
both
he
and
the
seconder
might
have
sung
comic
songs
in
lieu
of
speaking
,
without
anybody
's
being
a
bit
the
wiser
.
   
<EOS>
The
friends
of
Horatio
Fizkin
,
Esquire
,
having
had
their
innings
,
a
little
choleric
,
pink
-
faced
man
stood
forward
to
propose
another
fit
and
proper
person
to
represent
the
electors
of
Eatanswill
in
Parliament
;
and
very
swimmingly
the
pink
-
faced
gentleman
would
have
got
on
,
if
he
had
not
been
rather
too
choleric
to
entertain
a
sufficient
perception
of
the
fun
of
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
But
after
a
very
few
sentences
of
figurative
eloquence
,
the
pink
-
faced
gentleman
got
from
denouncing
those
who
interrupted
him
in
the
mob
,
to
exchanging
defiances
with
the
gentlemen
on
the
hustings
;
whereupon
arose
an
uproar
which
reduced
him
to
the
necessity
of
expressing
his
feelings
by
serious
pantomime
,
which
he
did
,
and
then
left
the
stage
to
his
seconder
,
who
delivered
a
written
speech
of
half
an
hour
's
length
,
and
would
n't
be
stopped
,
because
he
had
sent
it
all
to
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
,
and
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
had
already
printed
it
,
every
word
.
   
<EOS>
Then
Horatio
Fizkin
,
Esquire
,
of
Fizkin
Lodge
,
near
Eatanswill
,
presented
himself
for
the
purpose
of
addressing
the
electors
;
which
he
no
sooner
did
,
than
the
band
employed
by
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
,
commenced
performing
with
a
power
to
which
their
strength
in
the
morning
was
a
trifle
;
in
return
for
which
,
the
Buff
crowd
belaboured
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
the
Blue
crowd
;
on
which
the
Blue
crowd
endeavoured
to
dispossess
themselves
of
their
very
unpleasant
neighbours
the
Buff
crowd
;
and
a
scene
of
struggling
,
and
pushing
,
and
fighting
,
succeeded
,
to
which
we
can
no
more
do
justice
than
the
mayor
<EOS>
could
,
although
he
issued
imperative
orders
to
twelve
constables
to
seize
the
ringleaders
,
who
might
amount
in
number
to
two
hundred
and
fifty
,
or
thereabouts
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
these
encounters
,
Horatio
Fizkin
,
Esquire
,
of
Fizkin
Lodge
,
and
his
friends
,
waxed
fierce
and
furious
;
until
at
last
Horatio
Fizkin
,
Esquire
,
of
Fizkin
Lodge
,
begged
to
ask
his
opponent
,
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
,
of
Slumkey
Hall
,
whether
that
band
played
by
his
consent
;
which
question
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
declining
to
answer
,
Horatio
Fizkin
,
Esquire
,
of
Fizkin
Lodge
,
shook
his
fist
in
the
countenance
of
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
,
of
Slumkey
Hall
;
upon
which
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
,
his
blood
being
up
,
defied
Horatio
Fizkin
,
Esquire
,
to
mortal
combat
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
violation
of
all
known
rules
and
precedents
of
order
,
the
mayor
commanded
another
fantasia
on
the
bell
,
and
declared
that
he
would
bring
before
himself
,
both
Horatio
Fizkin
,
Esquire
,
of
Fizkin
Lodge
,
and
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
,
of
Slumkey
Hall
,
and
bind
them
over
to
keep
the
peace
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
terrific
denunciation
,
the
supporters
of
the
two
candidates
interfered
,
and
after
the
friends
of
each
party
had
quarrelled
in
pairs
,
for
three
-
quarters
of
an
hour
,
Horatio
Fizkin
,
Esquire
,
touched
his
hat
to
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
;
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
touched
his
to
Horatio
Fizkin
,
Esquire
;
the
band
was
stopped
;
the
crowd
were
partially
quieted
;
and
Horatio
Fizkin
,
Esquire
,
was
permitted
to
proceed
.
   
<EOS>
The
speeches
of
the
two
candidates
,
though
differing
in
every
other
respect
,
afforded
a
beautiful
tribute
to
the
merit
and
high
worth
of
the
electors
of
Eatanswill
.
 
<EOS>
Both
expressed
their
opinion
that
a
more
independent
,
a
more
enlightened
,
a
more
public
-
spirited
,
a
more
noble
-
minded
,
a
more
disinterested
set
of
men
than
those
who
had
promised
to
vote
for
him
,
never
existed
on
earth
;
each
darkly
hinted
his
suspicions
that
the
electors
in
the
opposite
interest
had
certain
swinish
and
besotted
infirmities
which
rendered
them
unfit
for
the
exercise
of
the
important
duties
they
were
called
upon
to
discharge
.
 
<EOS>
Fizkin
expressed
his
readiness
to
do
anything
he
was
wanted
:
Slumkey
,
his
determination
to
do
nothing
that
was
asked
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Both
said
that
the
trade
,
the
manufactures
,
the
commerce
,
the
prosperity
of
Eatanswill
,
would
ever
be
dearer
to
their
hearts
than
any
earthly
object
;
and
each
had
it
in
his
power
to
state
,
with
the
utmost
confidence
,
that
he
was
the
man
who
would
eventually
be
returned
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
show
of
hands
;
the
mayor
decided
in
favour
of
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
,
of
Slumkey
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
Horatio
Fizkin
,
Esquire
,
of
Fizkin
Lodge
,
demanded
a
poll
,
and
a
poll
was
fixed
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
Then
a
vote
of
thanks
was
moved
to
the
mayor
for
his
able
conduct
in
the
chair
;
and
the
mayor
,
devoutly
wishing
that
he
had
had
a
chair
to
display
his
able
conduct
in
(
for
he
had
been
standing
during
the
whole
proceedings
)
,
returned
thanks
.
<EOS>
The
processions
reformed
,
the
carriages
rolled
slowly
through
the
crowd
,
and
its
members
screeched
and
shouted
after
them
as
their
feelings
or
caprice
dictated
.
   
<EOS>
During
the
whole
time
of
the
polling
,
the
town
was
in
a
perpetual
fever
of
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
was
conducted
on
the
most
liberal
and
delightful
scale
.
 
<EOS>
Excisable
articles
were
remarkably
cheap
at
all
the
public
-
houses
;
and
spring
vans
paraded
the
streets
for
the
accommodation
of
voters
who
were
seized
with
any
temporary
dizziness
in
the
head
---
an
epidemic
which
prevailed
among
the
electors
,
during
the
contest
,
to
a
most
alarming
extent
,
and
under
the
influence
of
which
they
might
frequently
be
seen
lying
on
the
pavements
in
a
state
of
utter
insensibility
.
 
<EOS>
A
small
body
of
electors
remained
unpolled
on
the
very
last
day
.
<EOS>
They
were
calculating
and
reflecting
persons
,
who
had
not
yet
been
convinced
by
the
arguments
of
either
party
,
although
they
had
frequent
conferences
with
each
.
 
<EOS>
One
hour
before
the
close
of
the
poll
,
Mr
Perker
solicited
the
honour
of
a
private
interview
with
these
intelligent
,
these
noble
,
these
patriotic
men
.
 
<EOS>
it
was
granted
.
 
<EOS>
His
arguments
were
brief
but
satisfactory
.
 
<EOS>
They
went
in
a
body
to
the
poll
;
and
when
they
returned
,
the
Honourable
Samuel
Slumkey
,
of
Slumkey
Hall
,
was
returned
also
.

Chapter
14
.
<EOS>
Comprising
a
brief
description
of
the
company
at
the
Peacock
assembled
;
and
a
tale
told
by
a
bagman
 
<EOS>
It
is
pleasant
to
turn
from
contemplating
the
strife
and
turmoil
of
political
existence
,
to
the
peaceful
repose
of
private
life
.
 
<EOS>
Although
in
reality
no
great
partisan
of
either
side
,
Mr
Pickwick
was
sufficiently
fired
with
Mr
Pott
's
enthusiasm
,
to
apply
his
whole
time
and
attention
to
the
proceedings
,
of
which
the
last
chapter
affords
a
description
compiled
from
his
own
memoranda
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
while
he
was
thus
occupied
was
Mr
Winkle
idle
,
his
whole
time
being
devoted
to
pleasant
walks
and
short
country
excursions
with
Mrs
Pott
,
who
never
failed
,
when
such
an
opportunity
presented
itself
,
to
seek
some
relief
from
the
tedious
monotony
she
so
constantly
complained
of
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
gentlemen
being
thus
completely
domesticated
in
the
editor
's
house
,
Mr
Tupman
and
Mr
Snodgrass
were
in
a
great
measure
cast
upon
their
own
resources
.
 
<EOS>
Taking
but
little
interest
in
public
affairs
,
they
beguiled
their
time
chiefly
with
such
amusements
as
the
Peacock
afforded
,
which
were
limited
to
a
bagatelle
-
board
in
the
first
floor
,
and
a
sequestered
skittle
-
ground
in
the
back
yard
.
<EOS>
In
the
science
and
nicety
of
both
these
recreations
,
which
are
far
more
abstruse
than
ordinary
men
suppose
,
they
were
gradually
initiated
by
Mr
Weller
,
who
possessed
a
perfect
knowledge
of
such
pastimes
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
notwithstanding
that
they
were
in
a
great
measure
deprived
of
the
comfort
and
advantage
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
society
,
they
were
still
enabled
to
beguile
the
time
,
and
to
prevent
its
hanging
heavily
on
their
hands
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
evening
,
however
,
that
the
Peacock
presented
attractions
which
enabled
the
two
friends
to
resist
even
the
invitations
of
the
gifted
,
though
prosy
,
Pott
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
evening
that
the
"
commercial
room
"
was
filled
with
a
social
circle
,
whose
characters
and
manners
it
was
the
delight
of
Mr
Tupman
to
observe
;
whose
sayings
and
doings
it
was
the
habit
of
Mr
Snodgrass
to
note
down
.
   
<EOS>
Most
people
know
what
sort
of
places
commercial
rooms
usually
are
.
 
<EOS>
That
of
the
Peacock
differed
in
no
material
respect
from
the
generality
of
such
apartments
;
that
is
to
say
,
it
was
a
large
,
bare
-
looking
room
,
the
furniture
of
which
had
no
doubt
been
better
when
it
was
newer
,
with
a
spacious
table
in
the
centre
,
and
a
variety
of
smaller
dittos
in
the
corners
;
an
extensive
assortment
of
variously
shaped
chairs
,
and
an
old
Turkey
carpet
,
bearing
about
the
same
relative
proportion
to
the
size
of
the
room
,
as
a
lady
's
pocket
-
handkerchief
might
to
the
floor
of
a
watch
-
box
.
 
<EOS>
The
walls
were
garnished
with
one
or
two
large
maps
;
and
several
weather
-
beaten
rough
greatcoats
,
with
complicated
capes
,
dangled
from
a
long
row
of
pegs
in
one
corner
.
 
<EOS>
The
mantel
-
shelf
was
ornamented
with
a
wooden
inkstand
,
containing
one
stump
of
a
pen
and
half
a
wafer
;
a
road
-
book
and
directory
;
a
county
history
minus
the
cover
;
and
the
mortal
remains
of
a
trout
in
a
glass
coffin
.
 
<EOS>
The
atmosphere
was
redolent
of
tobacco
-
smoke
,
the
fumes
of
which
had
communicated
a
rather
dingy
hue
to
the
whole
room
,
and
more
especially
to
the
dusty
red
curtains
which
shaded
the
windows
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
sideboard
a
variety
of
miscellaneous
articles
were
huddled
together
,
the
most
conspicuous
of
which
were
some
very
cloudy
fish
-
sauce
cruets
,
a
couple
of
driving
-
boxes
,
two
or
three
whips
,
and
as
many
travelling
shawls
,
a
tray
of
knives
and
forks
,
and
the
mustard
.

it
was
that
Mr
Tupman
and
Mr
Snodgrass
were
seated
on
the
evening
after
the
conclusion
of
the
election
,
with
several
other
temporary
inmates
of
the
house
,
smoking
and
drinking
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
gents
,
"
said
a
stout
,
hale
personage
of
about
forty
,
with
only
one
eye
---
a
very
bright
black
eye
,
which
twinkled
with
a
roguish
expression
of
fun
and
good
-
humour
,
"
our
noble
selves
,
gents
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
propose
that
toast
to
the
company
,
and
drink
Mary
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
,
Mary
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Get
along
with
you
,
you
wretch
,
"
said
the
hand
-
maiden
,
obviously
not
ill
-
pleased
with
the
compliment
,
however
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
go
away
,
Mary
,
"
said
the
black
-
eyed
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
alone
,
imperence
,
"
said
the
young
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
said
the
one
-
eyed
man
,
calling
after
the
girl
as
she
left
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
step
out
by
and
by
,
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
Keep
your
spirits
up
,
dear
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
he
went
through
the
not
very
difficult
process
of
winking
upon
the
company
with
his
solitary
eye
,
to
the
enthusiastic
delight
of
an
elderly
personage
with
a
dirty
face
and
a
clay
pipe
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rum
creeters
is
women
,
"
said
the
dirty
-
faced
man
,
after
a
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
no
mistake
about
that
<EOS>
,
"
said
a
very
red
-
faced
man
,
behind
a
cigar
.
   
<EOS>
After
this
little
bit
of
philosophy
there
was
another
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
rummer
things
than
women
in
this
world
though
,
mind
you
,
"
said
the
man
with
the
black
eye
,
slowly
filling
a
large
Dutch
pipe
,
with
a
most
capacious
bowl
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
married
?
"
inquired
the
dirty
-
faced
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
say
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
the
dirty
-
faced
man
fell
into
ecstasies
of
mirth
at
his
own
retort
,
in
which
he
was
joined
by
a
man
of
bland
voice
and
placid
countenance
,
who
always
made
it
a
point
to
agree
with
everybody
.
   
<EOS>
"
Women
,
after
all
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
the
enthusiastic
Mr
Snodgrass
,
"
are
the
great
props
and
comforts
of
our
existence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
they
are
,
"
said
the
placid
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
they
're
in
a
good
humour
,
"
interposed
the
dirty
-
faced
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
's
very
true
,
"
said
the
placid
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
repudiate
that
qualification
,
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
,
whose
thoughts
were
fast
reverting
to
Emily
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
repudiate
it
with
disdain
---
with
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
Show
me
the
man
who
says
anything
against
women
,
as
women
,
and
I
boldly
declare
he
is
not
a
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
Mr
Snodgrass
took
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
,
and
struck
the
table
violently
with
his
clenched
fist
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
good
sound
argument
,
"
said
the
placid
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Containing
a
position
which
I
deny
,
"
interrupted
he
of
the
dirty
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
there
's
certainly
a
very
great
deal
of
truth
in
what
you
observe
too
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
placid
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
health
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
bagman
with
the
lonely
eye
,
bestowing
an
approving
nod
on
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
acknowledged
the
compliment
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
always
like
to
hear
a
good
argument
,
"
continued
the
bagman
,
"
a
sharp
one
,
like
this
:
<EOS>
it
's
very
improving
;
but
this
little
argument
about
women
brought
to
my
mind
a
story
I
have
heard
an
old
uncle
of
mine
tell
,
the
recollection
of
which
,
just
now
,
made
me
say
there
were
rummer
things
than
women
to
be
met
with
,
sometimes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
hear
that
same
story
,
"
said
the
red
-
faced
man
with
the
cigar
.
   
<EOS>
"
Should
you
?
<EOS>
"
was
the
only
reply
of
the
bagman
,
who
continued
to
smoke
with
great
vehemence
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
should
I
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
speaking
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
He
was
always
anxious
to
increase
his
stock
of
experience
.
   
<EOS>
"
Should
YOU
?
 
<EOS>
Well
then
,
I
'll
tell
it
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
wo
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
wo
n't
believe
it
,
"
said
the
man
with
the
roguish
eye
,
making
that
organ
look
more
roguish
than
ever
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
say
it
's
true
,
of
course
I
shall
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
upon
that
understanding
I
'll
tell
you
,
"
replied
the
traveller
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
hear
of
the
great
commercial
house
of
Bilson
&
Slum
?
 
<EOS>
But
it
does
n't
matter
though
,
whether
you
did
or
not
,
because
they
retired
from
business
long
since
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
eighty
years
ago
,
since
the
circumstance
happened
to
a
traveller
for
that
house
,
but
he
was
a
particular
friend
of
my
uncle
's
;
and
my
uncle
told
the
story
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
queer
name
;
but
he
used
to
call
it
     
<EOS>
THE
BAGMAN
'S
STORY
   
<EOS>
and
he
used
to
tell
it
,
something
in
this
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
winter
's
evening
,
about
five
o'clock
,
just
as
it
began
to
grow
dusk
,
a
man
in
a
gig
might
have
been
seen
urging
his
tired
horse
along
the
road
which
leads
across
Marlborough
Downs
,
in
the
direction
of
Bristol
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
he
might
have
been
seen
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
he
would
have
been
,
if
anybody
but
a
blind
man
had
happened
to
pass
that
way
;
but
the
weather
was
so
bad
,
and
the
night
<EOS>
so
cold
and
wet
,
that
nothing
was
out
<EOS>
but
the
water
,
and
so
the
traveller
jogged
along
in
the
middle
of
the
road
,
lonesome
and
dreary
enough
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
bagman
of
that
day
could
have
caught
sight
of
the
little
neck
-
or
-
nothing
sort
of
gig
,
with
a
clay
-
coloured
body
and
red
wheels
,
and
the
vixenish
,
ill
tempered
,
fast
-
going
bay
mare
,
that
looked
like
a
cross
between
a
butcher
's
horse
and
a
twopenny
post
-
office
pony
,
he
would
have
known
at
once
,
that
this
traveller
could
have
been
no
other
than
Tom
Smart
,
of
the
great
house
of
Bilson
and
Slum
,
Cateaton
Street
,
City
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
as
there
was
no
bagman
to
look
on
,
nobody
knew
anything
at
all
about
the
matter
;
and
so
Tom
Smart
and
his
clay
-
coloured
gig
with
the
red
wheels
,
and
the
vixenish
mare
with
the
fast
pace
,
went
on
together
,
keeping
the
secret
among
them
,
and
nobody
was
a
bit
the
wiser
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
are
many
pleasanter
places
even
in
this
dreary
world
,
than
Marlborough
Downs
when
it
blows
hard
;
and
if
you
throw
in
beside
,
a
gloomy
winter
's
evening
,
a
miry
and
sloppy
road
,
and
a
pelting
fall
of
heavy
rain
,
and
try
the
effect
,
by
way
of
experiment
,
in
your
own
proper
person
,
you
will
experience
the
full
force
of
this
observation
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
wind
blew
---
not
up
the
road
or
down
it
,
though
that
's
bad
enough
,
but
sheer
across
it
,
sending
the
rain
slanting
down
like
the
lines
they
used
to
rule
in
the
copy
-
books
at
school
,
to
make
the
boys
slope
well
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
moment
it
would
die
away
,
and
the
traveller
would
begin
to
delude
himself
into
the
belief
that
,
exhausted
with
its
previous
fury
,
it
had
quietly
laid
itself
down
to
rest
,
when
,
whoo
!
<EOS>
he
could
hear
it
growling
and
whistling
in
the
distance
,
and
on
it
would
come
rushing
over
the
hill
-
tops
,
and
sweeping
along
the
plain
,
gathering
sound
and
strength
as
it
drew
nearer
,
until
it
dashed
with
a
heavy
gust
against
horse
and
man
,
driving
the
sharp
rain
into
their
ears
,
and
its
cold
damp
breath
into
their
very
bones
;
and
past
them
it
would
scour
,
far
,
far
away
,
with
a
stunning
roar
,
as
if
in
ridicule
of
their
weakness
,
and
triumphant
in
the
consciousness
of
its
own
strength
and
power
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
bay
mare
splashed
away
,
through
the
mud
and
water
,
with
drooping
ears
;
now
and
then
tossing
her
head
as
if
to
express
her
disgust
at
this
very
ungentlemanly
behaviour
of
the
elements
,
but
keeping
a
good
pace
notwithstanding
,
until
a
gust
of
wind
,
more
furious
than
any
that
had
yet
assailed
them
,
caused
her
to
stop
suddenly
and
plant
her
four
feet
firmly
against
the
ground
,
to
prevent
her
being
blown
over
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
special
mercy
that
she
did
this
,
for
if
she
HAD
been
blown
over
,
the
vixenish
mare
was
so
light
,
and
the
gig
was
so
light
,
and
Tom
Smart
<EOS>
such
a
light
weight
into
the
bargain
,
that
they
must
infallibly
have
all
gone
rolling
over
and
over
together
,
until
they
reached
the
confines
of
earth
,
or
until
the
wind
fell
;
and
in
either
case
the
probability
is
,
that
neither
the
vixenish
mare
,
nor
the
clay
-
coloured
gig
with
the
red
wheels
,
nor
Tom
Smart
,
would
ever
have
been
fit
for
service
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Well
,
damn
my
straps
and
whiskers
,
"
says
Tom
Smart
<EOS>
(
Tom
sometimes
had
an
unpleasant
knack
of
swearing
)
---
"
damn
my
straps
and
whiskers
,
"
says
Tom
,
"
if
this
ai
n't
pleasant
,
blow
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
very
likely
ask
me
why
,
as
Tom
Smart
had
been
pretty
well
blown
already
,
he
expressed
this
wish
to
be
submitted
to
the
same
process
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
---
all
I
know
is
,
that
Tom
Smart
said
so
---
or
at
least
he
always
told
my
uncle
he
said
so
,
and
it
's
just
the
same
thing
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Blow
me
,
"
says
Tom
Smart
;
and
the
mare
neighed
as
if
she
were
precisely
of
the
same
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Cheer
up
,
old
girl
,
"
said
Tom
,
patting
the
bay
mare
on
the
neck
with
the
end
of
his
whip
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
do
pushing
on
,
such
a
night
as
this
;
the
first
house
we
come
to

we
'll
put
up
at

so
the
faster
you
go
the
sooner
<EOS>
it
's
over
.
 
<EOS>
Soho
,
old
girl
---
gently
---
gently

"
   
<EOS>
"
Whether
the
vixenish
mare
was
sufficiently
well
acquainted
with
the
tones
of
Tom
's
voice
to
comprehend
his
meaning
,
or
whether
she
found
it
colder
standing
still
than
moving
on
,
of
course
I
ca
n't
say
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
can
say
that
Tom
had
no
sooner
finished
speaking
,
than
she
pricked
up
her
ears
,
and
started
forward
at
a
speed
which
made
the
clay
-
coloured
gig
rattle
until
you
would
have
supposed
every
one
of
the
red
spokes
were
going
to
fly
out
on
the
turf
of
Marlborough
Downs
;
and
even
Tom
,
whip
as
he
was
,
could
n't
stop
or
check
her
pace
,
until
she
drew
up
of
her
own
accord
,
before
a
roadside
inn
on
the
right
-
hand
side
of
the
way
,
about
half
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
end
of
the
Downs
.
<EOS>
"
Tom
cast
a
hasty
glance
at
the
upper
part
of
the
house
as
he
threw
the
reins
to
the
hostler
,
and
stuck
the
whip
in
the
box
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
strange
old
place
,
built
of
a
kind
of
shingle
,
inlaid
,
as
it
were
,
with
cross
-
beams
,
with
gabled
-
topped
windows
projecting
completely
over
the
pathway
,
and
a
low
door
with
a
dark
porch
,
and
a
couple
of
steep
steps
leading
down
into
the
house
,
instead
of
the
modern
fashion
of
half
a
dozen
shallow
ones
leading
up
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
comfortable
-
looking
place
though
,
for
there
was
a
strong
,
cheerful
light
in
the
bar
window
,
which
shed
a
bright
ray
across
the
road
,
and
even
lighted
up
the
hedge
on
the
other
side
;
and
there
was
a
red
flickering
light
in
the
opposite
window
,
one
moment
but
faintly
discernible
,
and
the
next
gleaming
strongly
through
the
drawn
curtains
,
which
intimated
that
a
rousing
fire
was
blazing
within
.
 
<EOS>
Marking
these
little
evidences
with
the
eye
of
an
experienced
traveller
,
Tom
dismounted
with
as
much
agility
as
his
half
-
frozen
limbs
would
permit
,
and
entered
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
less
than
five
minutes
"
time
,
Tom
was
ensconced
in
the
room
opposite
the
bar
---
the
very
room
where
he
had
imagined
the
fire
blazing
---
before
a
substantial
,
matter
-
of
-
fact
,
roaring
fire
,
composed
of
something
short
of
a
bushel
of
coals
,
and
wood
enough
to
make
half
a
dozen
decent
gooseberry
bushes
,
piled
half
-
way
up
the
chimney
,
and
roaring
and
crackling
with
a
sound
that
of
itself
would
have
warmed
the
heart
of
any
reasonable
man
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
comfortable
,
but
this
was
not
all
;
for
a
smartly
-
dressed
girl
,
with
a
bright
eye
and
a
neat
ankle
,
was
laying
a
very
clean
white
cloth
on
the
table
;
and
as
Tom
sat
with
his
slippered
feet
on
the
fender
,
and
his
back
to
the
open
door
,
he
saw
a
charming
prospect
of
the
bar
reflected
in
the
glass
over
the
chimney
-
piece
,
with
delightful
rows
of
green
bottles
and
gold
labels
,
together
with
jars
of
pickles
and
preserves
,
and
cheeses
and
boiled
hams
,
and
rounds
of
beef
,
arranged
on
shelves
in
the
most
tempting
and
delicious
array

Well
,
this
was
comfortable
too
;
but
even
this
was
not
all
---
for
in
the
bar
,
seated
at
tea
at
the
nicest
possible
little
table
,
drawn
close
up
before
the
brightest
possible
little
fire
,
was
a
buxom
widow
of
somewhere
about
eight
-
and
-
forty
or
thereabouts
,
with
a
face
as
comfortable
as
the
bar
,
who
was
evidently
the
landlady
of
the
house
,
and
the
supreme
ruler
over
all
these
agreeable
possessions
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
drawback
to
the
beauty
of
the
whole
picture
,
and
that
was
a
tall
man
---
a
very
tall
man
---
in
a
brown
coat
and
bright
basket
buttons
,
and
black
whiskers
and
wavy
black
hair
,
who
was
seated
at
tea
with
the
widow
,
and
who
it
required
no
great
penetration
to
discover
was
in
a
fair
way
of
persuading
her
to
be
a
widow
no
longer
,
but
to
confer
upon
him
the
privilege
of
sitting
down
in
that
bar
,
for
and
during
the
whole
remainder
of
the
term
of
his
natural
life
.

<EOS>
Tom
Smart
was
by
no
means
of
an
irritable
or
envious
disposition
,
but
somehow
or
other
the
tall
man
with
the
brown
coat
and
the
bright
basket
buttons
did
rouse
what
little
gall
he
had
in
his
composition
,
and
did
make
him
feel
extremely
indignant
,
the
more
especially
as
he
could
now
and
then
observe
,
from
his
seat
before
the
glass
,
certain
little
affectionate
familiarities
passing
between
the
tall
man
and
the
widow
,
which
sufficiently
denoted
that
the
tall
man
was
as
high
in
favour
as
he
was
in
size
.
<EOS>
Tom
was
fond
of
hot
punch
---
I
may
venture
to
say
he
was
VERY
fond
of
hot
punch
---
and
after
he
had
seen
the
vixenish
mare
well
fed
and
well
littered
down
,
and
had
eaten
every
bit
of
the
nice
little
hot
dinner
which
the
widow
tossed
up
for
him
with
her
own
hands
,
he
just
ordered
a
tumbler
of
it
by
way
of
experiment
.
<EOS>
Now
,
if
there
was
one
thing
in
the
whole
range
of
domestic
art
,
which
the
widow
could
manufacture
better
than
another
,
it
was
this
identical
article
;
and
the
first
tumbler
was
adapted
to
Tom
Smart
's
taste
with
such
peculiar
nicety
,
that
he
ordered
a
second
with
the
least
possible
delay
.
 
<EOS>
Hot
punch
is
a
pleasant
thing
,
gentlemen
---
an
extremely
pleasant
thing
under
any
circumstances
 
---
but
in
that
snug
old
parlour
,
before
the
roaring
fire
,
with
the
wind
blowing
outside
till
every
timber
in
the
old
house
creaked
again
,
Tom
Smart
found
it
perfectly
delightful
.
 
<EOS>
He
ordered
another
tumbler
,
and
then
another
---
<EOS>
I
am
not
quite
certain
whether
he
did
n't
order
another
after
that
---
but
the
more
he
drank
of
the
hot
punch
,
the
more
he
thought
of
the
tall
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Confound
his
impudence
!
"
<EOS>
said
Tom
to
himself
,
"
what
business
has
he
in
that
snug
bar
?
 
<EOS>
Such
an
ugly
villain
too
!
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
the
widow
had
any
taste
,
she
might
surely
pick
up
some
better
fellow
than
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
Tom
's
eye
wandered
from
the
glass
on
the
chimney
-
piece
to
the
glass
on
the
table
;
and
as
he
felt
himself
becoming
gradually
sentimental
,
he
emptied
the
fourth
tumbler
of
punch
and
ordered
a
fifth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
Smart
,
gentlemen
,
had
always
been
very
much
attached
to
the
public
line
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
long
his
ambition
to
stand
in
a
bar
of
his
own
,
in
a
green
coat
,
knee
-
cords
,
and
tops
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
great
notion
of
taking
the
chair
at
convivial
dinners
,
and
he
had
often
thought
how
well
he
could
preside
in
a
room
of
his
own
in
the
talking
way
,
and
what
a
capital
example
he
could
set
to
his
customers
in
the
drinking
department
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
things
passed
rapidly
through
Tom
's
mind
as
he
sat
drinking
the
hot
punch
by
the
roaring
fire
,
and
he
felt
very
justly
and
properly
indignant
that
the
tall
man
should
be
in
a
fair
way
of
keeping
such
an
excellent
house
,
while
he
,
Tom
Smart
,
was
as
far
off
from
it
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
after
deliberating
over
the
two
last
tumblers
,
whether
he
had
n't
a
perfect
right
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
the
tall
man
for
having
contrived
to
get
into
the
good
graces
of
the
buxom
widow
,
Tom
Smart
at
last
arrived
at
the
satisfactory
conclusion
that
he
was
a
very
ill
-
used
and
persecuted
individual
,
and
had
better
go
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Up
a
wide
and
ancient
staircase
the
smart
girl
preceded
Tom
,
shading
the
chamber
candle
with
her
hand
,
to
protect
it
from
the
currents
of
air
which
in
such
a
rambling
old
place
might
have
found
plenty
of
room
to
disport
themselves
in
,
without
blowing
the
candle
out
,
but
which
did
blow
it
out
nevertheless
---
thus
affording
Tom
's
enemies
an
opportunity
of
asserting
that
it
was
he
,
and
not
the
wind
,
who
extinguished
the
candle
,
and
that
while
he
pretended
to
be
blowing
it
alight
again
,
he
was
in
fact
kissing
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
another
light
was
obtained
,
and
Tom
was
conducted
through
a
maze
of
rooms
,
and
a
labyrinth
of
passages
,
to
the
apartment
which
had
been
prepared
for
his
reception
,
where
the
girl
bade
him
good
-
night
and
left
him
alone
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
good
large
room
with
big
closets
,
and
a
bed
which
might
have
served
for
a
whole
boarding
-
school
,
to
say
nothing
of
a
couple
of
oaken
presses
that
would
have
held
the
baggage
of
a
small
army
;
but
what
struck
Tom
's
fancy
most
was
a
strange
,
grim
-
looking
,
high
backed
chair
,
carved
in
the
most
fantastic
manner
,
with
a
flowered
damask
cushion
,
and
the
round
knobs
at
the
bottom
of
the
legs
carefully
tied
up
in
red
cloth
,
as
if
it
had
got
the
gout
in
its
toes
.
 
<EOS>
Of
any
other
queer
chair
,
Tom
would
only
have
thought
it
was
a
queer
chair
,
and
there
would
have
been
an
end
of
the
matter
;
but
there
was
something
about
this
particular
chair
,
and
yet
he
could
n't
tell
what
it
was
,
so
odd
and
<EOS>
so
unlike
any
other
piece
of
furniture
he
had
ever
seen
,
that
it
seemed
to
fascinate
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
down
before
the
fire
,
and
stared
at
the
old
chair
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Damn
the
chair
,
it
was
such
a
strange
old
thing
,
he
could
n't
take
his
eyes
off
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Tom
,
slowly
undressing
himself
,
and
staring
at
the
old
chair
all
the
while
,
which
stood
with
a
mysterious
aspect
by
the
bedside
,
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
such
a
rum
concern
as
that
in
my
days
.
 
<EOS>
Very
odd
,
"
said
Tom
,
who
had
got
rather
sage
with
the
hot
punch
---
<EOS>
"
very
odd
.
"
 
<EOS>
Tom
shook
his
head
with
an
air
of
profound
wisdom
,
and
looked
at
the
chair
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
n't
make
anything
of
it
though
,
so
he
got
into
bed
,
covered
himself
up
warm
,
and
fell
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
about
half
an
hour
,
Tom
woke
up
with
a
start
,
from
a
confused
dream
of
tall
men
and
tumblers
of
punch
;
and
the
first
object
that
presented
itself
to
his
waking
imagination
was
the
queer
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
wo
n't
look
at
it
any
more
,
"
said
Tom
to
himself
,
and
he
squeezed
his
eyelids
together
,
and
tried
to
persuade
himself
he
was
going
to
sleep
again
.
 
<EOS>
No
use
;
nothing
but
queer
chairs
danced
before
his
eyes
,
kicking
up
their
legs
,
jumping
over
each
other
's
backs
,
and
playing
all
kinds
of
antics
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
may
as
well
see
one
real
chair
,
as
two
or
three
complete
sets
of
false
ones
,
"
said
Tom
,
bringing
out
his
head
from
under
the
bedclothes
.
 
<EOS>
There
it
was
,
plainly
discernible
by
the
light
of
the
fire
,
looking
as
provoking
as
ever
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
gazed
at
the
chair
;
and
,
suddenly
as
he
looked
at
it
,
a
most
extraordinary
change
seemed
to
come
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
carving
of
the
back
gradually
assumed
the
lineaments
and
expression
of
an
old
,
shrivelled
human
face
;
the
damask
cushion
became
an
antique
,
flapped
waistcoat
;
the
round
knobs
grew
into
a
couple
of
feet
,
encased
in
red
cloth
slippers
;
and
the
whole
chair
looked
like
a
very
ugly
old
man
,
of
the
previous
century
,
with
his
arms
akimbo
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
sat
up
in
bed
,
and
rubbed
his
eyes
to
dispel
the
illusion
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
The
chair
was
an
ugly
old
gentleman
;
and
what
was
more
,
he
was
winking
at
Tom
Smart
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
was
naturally
a
headlong
,
careless
sort
of
dog
,
and
he
had
had
five
tumblers
of
hot
punch
into
the
bargain
;
so
,
although
he
was
a
little
startled
at
first
,
he
began
to
grow
rather
indignant
when
he
saw
the
old
gentleman
winking
and
leering
at
him
with
such
an
impudent
air
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
resolved
that
he
would
n't
stand
it
;
and
as
the
old
face
still
kept
winking
away
as
fast
as
ever
,
Tom
said
,
in
a
very
angry
tone
---
   
"
"
What
the
devil
are
you
winking
at
me
for
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
"
Because
I
like
it
,
Tom
Smart
,
"
said
the
chair
;
or
the
old
gentleman
,
whichever
you
like
to
call
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
stopped
winking
though
,
when
Tom
spoke
,
and
began
grinning
like
a
superannuated
monkey
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
my
name
,
old
nut
-
cracker
face
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Tom
Smart
,
rather
staggered
;
though
he
pretended
to
carry
it
off
so
well
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Come
,
come
,
Tom
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
"
that
's
not
the
way
to
address
solid
Spanish
mahogany
.
 
<EOS>
Damme
,
you
could
n't
treat
me
with
less
respect
if
I
was
veneered
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
When
the
old
gentleman
said
this
,
he
looked
so
fierce
that
Tom
began
to
grow
frightened
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
did
n't
mean
to
treat
you
with
any
disrespect
,
Sir
,
"
said
Tom
,
in
a
much
humbler
tone
than
he
had
spoken
in
at
first
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Well
,
well
,
"
said
the
old
fellow
,
"
perhaps
not
---
perhaps
not
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
---
"
   
"
"
sir
---
"
   
"
"
I
know
everything
about
you
,
Tom
;
everything
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
very
poor
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
certainly
am
,
"
said
Tom
Smart
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
how
came
you
to
know
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
Never
mind
that
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
;
"
you
're
much
too
fond
of
punch
,
Tom
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
Smart
was
just
on
the
point
of
protesting
that
he
had
n't
tasted
a
drop
since
his
last
birthday
,
but
when
his
eye
encountered
that
of
the
old
gentleman
he
looked
so
knowing
that
Tom
blushed
,
and
was
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Tom
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
"
the
widow
's
a
fine
woman
---
remarkably
fine
woman
---
eh
,
Tom
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
the
old
fellow
screwed
up
his
eyes
,
cocked
up
one
of
his
wasted
little
legs
,
and
looked
altogether
so
unpleasantly
amorous
,
that
Tom
was
quite
disgusted
with
the
levity
of
his
behaviour
---
at
his
time
of
life
,
too
!
"
<EOS>
"
I
am
her
guardian
,
Tom
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Are
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Tom
Smart
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
knew
her
mother
,
Tom
,
"
said
the
old
fellow
:
"
and
her
grandmother
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
very
fond
of
me
---
made
me
this
waistcoat
,
Tom
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
Did
she
?
"
said
Tom
Smart
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
And
these
shoes
,
"
said
the
old
fellow
,
lifting
up
one
of
the
red
cloth
mufflers
;
"
but
do
n't
mention
it
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
n't
like
to
have
it
known
that
she
was
so
much
attached
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
occasion
some
unpleasantness
in
the
family
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
When
the
old
rascal
said
this
,
he
looked
so
extremely
impertinent
,
that
,
as
Tom
Smart
afterwards
declared
,
he
could
have
sat
upon
him
without
remorse
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
have
been
a
great
favourite
among
the
women
in
my
time
,
Tom
,
"
said
the
profligate
old
debauchee
;
"
hundreds
of
fine
women
have
sat
in
my
lap
for
hours
together
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
that
<EOS>
,
you
dog
,
eh
!
"
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
was
proceeding
to
recount
some
other
exploits
of
his
youth
,
when
he
was
seized
with
such
a
violent
fit
of
creaking
that
he
was
unable
to
proceed
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Just
serves
you
right

old
boy

thought
Tom
Smart
;
but
he
did
n't
say
anything
.

"
"
Ah

"
said
the
old
fellow
,
"
I
am
a
good
deal
troubled

this

performed

your
reverend
locks
,
"
said
Tom
(
he
had
a
few
scattered
horse
-
hairs
left
)
<EOS>
---
"
bless
your
reverend
locks
,
she
would
n't
have
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
Tom
sighed
involuntarily
,
as
he
thought
of
the
bar
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Would
n't
she
?
"
said
the
old
gentleman
firmly
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Tom
;
"
there
's
somebody
else
in
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
A
tall
man
---
a
confoundedly
tall
man
---
with
black
whiskers
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
Tom
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
;
"
she
will
never
have
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
Wo
n't
she
?
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
stood
in
the
bar
,
old
gentleman
,
you
'd
tell
another
story
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
Pooh
,
pooh
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
all
about
that
.
 
<EOS>
"
   
"
"
About
what
?
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
The
kissing
behind
the
door
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
,
Tom
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
he
gave
another
impudent
look
,
which
made
Tom
very
wroth
,
because
as
you
all
know
,
gentlemen
,
to
hear
an
old
fellow
,
who
ought
to
know
better
,
talking
about
these
things
,
is
very
unpleasant
---
nothing
more
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
know
all
about
that
,
Tom
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
it
done
very
often
in
my
time
,
Tom
,
between
more
people
than
I
should
like
to
mention
to
you
;
but
it
never
came
to
anything
after
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
You
must
have
seen
some
queer
things
,
"
said
Tom
,
with
an
inquisitive
look
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
You
may
say
that
,
Tom
,
"
replied
the
old
fellow
,
with
a
very
complicated
wink
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
last
of
my
family
,
Tom
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
with
a
melancholy
sigh
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Was
it
a
large
one
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Tom
Smart
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
There
were
twelve
of
us
,
Tom
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
;
"
fine
,
straight
-
backed
,
handsome
fellows
as
you
'd
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
None
of
your
modern
abortions
---
all
with
arms
,
and
with
a
degree
of
polish
,
though
I
say
it
that
should
not
,
which
it
would
have
done
your
heart
good
to
behold
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
And
what
's
become
of
the
others
,
Sir
?
"
asked
Tom
Smart
---
   
<EOS>
"
The
old
gentleman
applied
his
elbow
to
his
eye
as
he
replied
,
"
Gone
,
Tom
,
gone
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
hard
service
,
Tom
,
and
they
had
n't
all
my
constitution
.
 
<EOS>
They
got
rheumatic
about
the
legs
and
arms
,
and
went
into
kitchens
and
other
hospitals
;
and
one
of
'em
,
with
long
service
and
hard
usage
,
positively
lost
his
senses
<EOS>
---
he
got
so
crazy
that
he
was
obliged
to
be
burnt
.
 
<EOS>
Shocking
thing
that
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
Dreadful
!
"
said
Tom
Smart
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
old
fellow
paused
for
a
few
minutes
,
apparently
struggling
with
his
feelings
of
emotion
,
and
then
said
---
   
"
<EOS>
"
However
,
Tom
,
I
am
wandering
from
the
point
.
 
<EOS>
This
tall
man
,
Tom
,
is
a
rascally
adventurer
.
 
<EOS>
The
moment
he
married
the
widow
,
he
would
sell
off
all
the
furniture
,
and
run
away
.
 
<EOS>
What
would
be
the
consequence
?
 
<EOS>
She
would
be
deserted
and
reduced
to
ruin
,
and
I
should
catch
my
death
of
cold
in
some
broker
's
shop
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
---
"
   
"
"
Do
n't
interrupt
me
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
you
,
Tom
,
I
entertain
a
very
different
opinion
;
for
I
well
know
that
if
you
once
settled
yourself
in
a
public
-
house
,
you
would
never
leave
it
,
as
long
as
there
was
anything
to
drink
within
its
walls
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
good
opinion
,
Sir
,
"
said
Tom
Smart
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Therefore
,
"
resumed
the
old
gentleman
,
in
a
dictatorial
tone
,
"
you
shall
have
her
,
and
he
shall
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
What
is
to
prevent
it
?
"
said
Tom
Smart
eagerly
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
This
disclosure
,
"
replied
the
old
gentleman
;
"
he
is
already
married
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
prove
it
?
"
said
Tom
,
starting
half
out
of
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
old
gentleman
untucked
his
arm
from
his
side
,
and
having
pointed
to
one
of
the
oaken
presses
,
immediately
replaced
it
,
in
its
old
position
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
He
little
thinks
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
"
that
in
the
right
-
hand
pocket
of
a
pair
of
trousers
in
that
press
,
he
has
left
a
letter
,
entreating
him
to
return
to
his
disconsolate
wife
,
with
six
<EOS>
---
mark
me
,
<EOS>
Tom
---
six
babes
,
and
all
of
them
small
ones
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
the
old
gentleman
solemnly
uttered
these
words
,
his
features
grew
less
and
less
distinct
,
and
his
figure
more
shadowy
.
<EOS>
A
film
came
over
Tom
Smart
's
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
seemed
gradually
blending
into
the
chair
,
the
damask
waistcoat
to
resolve
into
a
cushion
,
the
red
slippers
to
shrink
into
little
red
cloth
bags
.
 
<EOS>
The
light
faded
gently
away
,
and
Tom
Smart
fell
back
on
his
pillow
,
and
dropped
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
"
Morning
aroused
Tom
from
the
lethargic
slumber
,
into
which
he
had
fallen
on
the
disappearance
of
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
up
in
bed
,
and
for
some
minutes
vainly
endeavoured
to
recall
the
events
of
the
preceding
night
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
they
rushed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
the
chair
;
it
was
a
fantastic
and
grim
-
looking
piece
of
furniture
,
certainly
,
but
it
must
have
been
a
remarkably
ingenious
and
lively
imagination
,
that
could
have
discovered
any
resemblance
between
it
and
an
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
,
old
boy
?
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
bolder
in
the
daylight
---
most
men
are
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
chair
remained
motionless
,
and
spoke
not
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Miserable
morning
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
The
chair
would
not
be
drawn
into
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Which
press
did
you
point
to
?
<EOS>
---
you
can
tell
me
that
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
Devil
<EOS>
a
word
,
gentlemen
,
the
chair
would
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
It
's
not
much
trouble
to
open
it
,
anyhow
,
"
said
Tom
,
getting
out
of
bed
very
deliberately
.
 
<EOS>
He
walked
up
to
one
of
the
presses
.
 
<EOS>
The
key
was
in
the
lock
;
he
turned
it
,
and
opened
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
pair
of
trousers
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
into
the
pocket
,
and
drew
forth
the
identical
letter
the
old
gentleman
had
described
!
   
"
<EOS>
"
Queer
sort
of
thing
,
this
,
"
said
Tom
Smart
,
looking
first
at
the
chair
and
then
at
the
press
,
and
then
at
the
letter
,
and
then
at
the
chair
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
queer
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
there
was
nothing
in
either
,
to
lessen
the
queerness
,
he
thought
he
might
as
well
dress
himself
,
and
settle
the
tall
man
's
business
at
once
---
just
to
put
him
out
of
his
misery
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
surveyed
the
rooms
he
passed
through
,
on
his
way
downstairs
,
with
the
scrutinising
eye
of
a
landlord
;
thinking
it
not
impossible
,
that
before
long
,
they
and
their
contents
would
be
his
property
.
 
<EOS>
The
tall
man
was
standing
in
the
snug
little
bar
,
with
his
hands
behind
him
,
quite
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
grinned
vacantly
at
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
A
casual
observer
might
have
supposed
he
did
it
,
only
to
show
his
white
teeth
;
but
Tom
Smart
thought
that
a
consciousness
of
triumph
was
passing
through
the
place
where
the
tall
man
's
mind
would
have
been
,
if
he
had
had
any
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
laughed
in
his
face
;
and
summoned
the
landlady
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Good
-
morning
ma'am
,
"
said
Tom
Smart
,
closing
the
door
of
the
little
parlour
as
the
widow
entered
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Good
-
morning
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
widow
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
will
you
take
for
breakfast
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
was
thinking
how
he
should
open
the
case
,
so
he
made
no
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
There
's
a
very
nice
ham
,
"
said
the
widow
,
"
and
a
beautiful
cold
larded
fowl
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
send
'em
in
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
These
words
roused
Tom
from
his
reflections
.
 
<EOS>
His
admiration
of
the
widow
increased
as
she
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
Thoughtful
creature
!
<EOS>
Comfortable
provider
!
   
<EOS>
"
"
Who
is
that
gentleman
in
the
bar
,
ma'am
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
His
name
is
Jinkins
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
widow
,
slightly
blushing
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
He
's
a
tall
man
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
He
is
a
very
fine
man
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
widow
,
"
and
a
very
nice
gentleman
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Is
there
anything
more
you
want
,
Sir
?
"
inquired
the
widow
,
rather
puzzled
by
Tom
's
manner
.
"
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
ma'am
,
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
sit
down
for
one
moment
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
widow
looked
much
amazed
,
but
she
sat
down
,
and
Tom
sat
down
too
,
close
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
it
happened
,
gentlemen
---
indeed
my
uncle
used
to
tell
me
that
Tom
Smart
said
he
did
n't
know
how
it
happened
either
---
but
somehow
or
other
the
palm
of
Tom
's
hand
fell
upon
the
back
of
the
widow
's
hand
,
and
remained
there
while
he
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
My
dear
ma'am
,
"
said
Tom
Smart
---
he
had
always
a
great
notion
of
committing
the
amiable
---
"
my
dear
ma'am
,
you
deserve
a
very
excellent
husband
---
you
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
"
Lor
,
Sir
!
"
said
the
widow
---
<EOS>
as
well
she
might
;
Tom
's
mode
of
commencing
the
conversation
being
rather
unusual
,
not
to
say
startling
;
the
fact
of
his
never
having
set
eyes
upon
her
before
the
previous
night
being
taken
into
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lor
,
Sir
!
"
   
"
"
I
scorn
to
flatter
,
my
dear
ma'am
,
"
said
Tom
Smart
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
deserve
a
very
admirable
husband
,
and
whoever
he
is
,
he
'll
be
a
very
lucky
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
Tom
said
this
,
his
eye
involuntarily
wandered
from
the
widow
's
face
to
the
comfort
around
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
widow
looked
more
puzzled
than
ever
,
and
made
an
effort
to
rise
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
gently
pressed
her
hand
,
as
if
to
detain
her
,
and
she
kept
her
seat
.
 
<EOS>
Widows
,
gentlemen
,
are
not
usually
timorous
,
as
my
uncle
used
to
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
am
sure
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
Sir
,
for
your
good
opinion
,
"
said
the
buxom
landlady
,
half
laughing
;
"
and
if
ever
I
marry
again
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
"
IF
,
"
said
Tom
Smart
,
looking
very
shrewdly
out
of
the
right
-
hand
corner
of
his
left
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
IF
---
"
"
"
Well
,
"
said
the
widow
,
laughing
outright
this
time
,
"
WHEN
I
do
<EOS>
,
I
hope
I
shall
have
as
good
a
husband
as
you
describe
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
"
Jinkins
,
to
wit
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Lor
,
sir
!
"
exclaimed
the
widow
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Oh
,
do
n't
tell
me
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
I
know
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
am
sure
nobody
who
knows
him
,
knows
anything
bad
of
him
,
"
said
the
widow
,
bridling
up
at
the
mysterious
air
with
which
Tom
had
spoken
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Hem
!
"
said
Tom
Smart
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
widow
began
to
think
it
was
high
time
to
cry
,
so
she
took
out
her
handkerchief
,
and
inquired
whether
Tom
wished
to
insult
her
,
whether
he
thought
it
like
a
gentleman
to
take
away
the
character
of
another
gentleman
behind
his
back
,
why
,
if
he
had
got
anything
to
say
,
he
did
n't
say
it
to
the
man
,
like
a
man
,
instead
of
terrifying
a
poor
weak
woman
in
that
way
;
and
so
forth
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
'll
say
it
to
him
fast
enough
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
<EOS>
only
I
want
you
to
hear
it
first
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
What
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
widow
,
looking
intently
in
Tom
's
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
'll
astonish
you
,
"
said
Tom
,
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
If
it
is
,
that
he
wants
money
,
"
said
the
widow
,
"
I
know
that
already
,
and
you
need
n't
trouble
yourself
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
Pooh
,
nonsense
,
that
's
nothing

Tain't

"
Oh

dear

what
can

"
exclaimed
the
poor
widow
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Do
n't
be
frightened
,
"
said
Tom
Smart
.
 
<EOS>
He
slowly
drew
forth
the
letter
,
and
unfolded
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
scream
?
"
said
Tom
doubtfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
No

no

"
replied
the
widow
;
"
let
me
see
it

"
   
<EOS>
"
"
You
wo
n't
go
fainting
away
,
or
any
of
that
nonsense
?

said
Tom

<EOS>
"
"
No
,
no

"
returned
the
widow
hastily
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
And
do
n't
run
out
,
and
blow
him
up
,
"
said
Tom
;
"
because
I
'll
do
all
that
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
not
exert
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
"
Well
,
well

"
said
the
widow
,
"
let
me
see
it

<EOS>
"
   
"
"
I
will
,
"
replied
Tom
Smart
;
and
,
with
these
words
,
he
placed
the
letter
in
the
widow
's
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
I
have
heard
my
uncle
say
,
that
Tom
Smart
said
the
widow
's
lamentations
when
she
heard
the
disclosure
would
have
pierced
a
heart
of
stone
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
was
certainly
very
tender
-
hearted
,
but
they
pierced
his
,
to
the
very
core
.
 
<EOS>
The
widow
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
,
and
wrung
her
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Oh
,
the
deception
and
villainy
of
the
man
!
"
said
the
widow
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Frightful
,
my
dear
ma'am
;
but
compose
yourself
,
"
said
Tom
Smart
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
compose
myself
,
"
shrieked
the
widow
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
find
anyone
else
I
can
love
so
much
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
Oh
,
yes
you
will
,
my
dear
soul
,
"
said
Tom
Smart
,
letting
fall
a
shower
of
the
largest
-
sized
tears
,
in
pity
for
the
widow
's
misfortunes
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
Smart
,
in
the
energy
of
his
compassion
,
had
put
his
arm
round
the
widow
's
waist
;
and
the
widow
,
in
a
passion
of
grief
,
had
clasped
Tom
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
up
in
Tom
's
face
,
and
smiled
through
her
tears
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
looked
down
in
hers
,
and
smiled
through
his
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
could
find
out
,
gentlemen
,
whether
Tom
did
or
did
not
kiss
the
widow
at
that
particular
moment
.
 
<EOS>
He
used
to
tell
my
uncle
he
did
n't
,
but
I
have
my
doubts
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Between
ourselves
,
gentlemen
,
I
rather
think
he
did
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
Tom
kicked
the
very
tall
man
out
at
the
front
door
half
an
hour
later
,
and
married
the
widow
a
month
after
.
<EOS>
And
he
used
to
drive
about
the
country
,
with
the
clay
-
coloured
gig
with
the
red
wheels
,
and
the
vixenish
mare
with
the
fast
pace
,
till
he
gave
up
business
many
years
afterwards
,
and
went
to
France
with
his
wife
;
and
then
the
old
house
was
pulled
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
allow
me
to
ask
you
,
"
said
the
inquisitive
old
gentleman
,
"
what
became
of
the
chair
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
replied
the
one
-
eyed
bagman
,
"
it
was
observed
to
creak
very
much
on
the
day
of
the
wedding
;
but
Tom
Smart
could
n't
say
for
certain
whether
it
was
with
pleasure
or
bodily
infirmity
.
<EOS>
He
rather
thought
it
was
the
latter
,
though
,
for
it
never
spoke
afterwards
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Everybody
believed
the
story
,
did
n't
they
?
"
said
the
dirty
-
faced
man
,
refilling
his
pipe
.
   
<EOS>
"
Except
Tom
's
enemies
,
"
replied
the
bagman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Some
of
'em
said
Tom
invented
it
altogether
;
and
others
said
he
was
drunk
and
fancied
it
,
and
got
hold
of
the
wrong
trousers
by
mistake
before
he
went
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
But
nobody
ever
minded
what
THEY
said
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
Smart
said
it
was
all
true
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Every
word

"
   
"
<EOS>
And
your
uncle
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Every
letter

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
must
have
been
very
nice
men
,
both
of
'
em

"
said
the
dirty
-
faced
man

<EOS>
"
Yes
,
they
were

replied
the
bagman
;
"
very
nice
men
indeed

the

<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
conscience
had
been
somewhat
reproaching
him
for
his
recent
neglect
of
his
friends
at
the
Peacock
;
and
he
was
just
on
the
point
of
walking
forth
in
quest
of
them
,
on
the
third
morning
after
the
election
had
terminated
,
when
his
faithful
valet
put
into
his
hand
a
card
,
on
which
was
engraved
the
following
inscription
:

"

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
on
hearing
this
determination
,
descended
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
where
sat
a
grave
man
,
who
started
up
on
his
entrance
,
and
said
,
with
an
air
of
profound
respect
:
---
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pickwick
,
I
presume
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Allow

said
the
grave
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
shook
the
extended
hand
,
and
then
continued
---
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
heard
of
your
fame

<EOS>
The
noise
of
your
antiquarian
discussion

reached
the
ears
of
Mrs

Hunter

my
wife

I

---
the
stranger
paused
,
as
if
he
expected
that
Mr
Pickwick
would
be
overcome
by
the
disclosure
;
but
seeing
that
he
remained
perfectly
calm
,
proceeded

He

Sir

replied
the
grave

"
all
Mrs

it

her
ambition

<EOS>

It

When

My

So

She

<EOS>

Mr

<EOS>
The
grave
man
considered
deeply

for
a
few
seconds
,
and
then
said
---
   
"
<EOS>
On
reflection
,
Sir
,
I
do
n't
know
whether
it
would
not
afford
Mrs

Hunter
greater
pleasure
,
if
her
guests
saw
a
gentleman

your
celebrity
in
his
own
costume

rather
than
in
an
assumed
one

<EOS>
I
may
venture
to
promise
an
exception
in
your
case
,
sir
---
<EOS>
yes
,
I
am
quite
certain
that
,
on
behalf
of
Mrs

Hunter

I
may
venture
to
do
so
.

<EOS>
"
In

said
Mr

"
I
shall
have
great
pleasure

coming

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
waste
your
time

Sir

said
the
grave
man

as
if
suddenly
recollecting
himself

<EOS>
"
I
know
its
value

<EOS>
I
will
not
detain
you

<EOS>
I
may
tell
Mrs

then

that
she
may
confidently
expect
you

<EOS>
Good

eminent

not

<EOS>
And
without
giving
Mr
Pickwick
time
to
offer
remonstrance
or
denial
,
Mr
Leo
Hunter
stalked
gravely
away
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
took
up
his
hat
,
and
repaired
to
the
Peacock

but
Mr

had
conveyed
the
intelligence
of

ball
there

before
him

<EOS>
"
Mrs

going

were
the

he
saluted
his
leader

Is

?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
Apollo
,
"
replied
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
Pott
objects
to
the
tunic
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
right
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
quite
right
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
emphatically
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
so
she
's
going
to
wear
a
white
satin
gown
with
gold
spangles
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
'll
hardly
know
what
she
's
meant
for
;
will
they
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
they
will
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
indignantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
'll
see
her
lyre
,
wo
n't
they
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
True
;
I
forgot
that
,
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
go
as
a
bandit
,
"
interposed
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
a
sudden
start
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
a
bandit
,
"
repeated
Mr
Tupman
,
mildly
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
gazing
with
solemn
sternness
at
his
friend
<EOS>
---
"
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
,
Mr
Tupman
,
that
it
is
your
intention
to
put
yourself
into
a
green
velvet
jacket
,
with
a
two
-
inch
tail
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Such
IS
my
intention
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Tupman
warmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
considerably
excited
---
"
because
you
are
too
old
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Too
old
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
if
any
further
ground
of
objection
be
wanting
,
"
continued
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
you
are
too
fat
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
his
face
suffused
with
a
crimson
glow
,
"
this
is
an
insult
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
in
the
same
tone
,
"
it
is
not
half
the
insult
to
you
,
that
your
appearance
in
my
presence
in
a
green
velvet
jacket
,
with
a
two
-
inch
tail
,
would
be
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
"
you
're
a
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
you
're
another
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
advanced
a
step
or
two
,
and
glared
at
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
returned
the
glare
,
concentrated
into
a
focus
by
means
of
his
spectacles
,
and
breathed
a
bold
defiance
.
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
and
Mr
Winkle
looked
on
,
petrified
at
beholding
such
a
scene
between
two
such
men
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
after
a
short
pause
,
speaking
in
a
low
,
deep
voice
,
"
you
have
called
me
old
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
fat
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
reiterate
the
charge
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
a
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
fearful
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
attachment
to
your
person
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
speaking
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
emotion
,
and
tucking
up
his
wristbands
meanwhile
,
"
is
great
---
very
great
---
<EOS>
but
upon
that
person
,
I
must
take
summary
vengeance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
on
,
Sir
!
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
Stimulated
by
the
exciting
nature
of
the
dialogue
,
the
heroic
man
actually
threw
himself
into
a
paralytic
attitude
,
confidently
supposed
by
the
two
bystanders
to
have
been
intended
as
a
posture
of
defence
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Snodgrass
,
suddenly
recovering
the
power
of
speech
,
of
which
intense
astonishment
had
previously
bereft
him
,
and
rushing
between
the
two
,
at
the
imminent
hazard
of
receiving
an
application
on
the
temple
from
each
---
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
the
eyes
of
the
world
upon
you
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
!
<EOS>
who
,
in
common
with
us
all
,
derives
a
lustre
from
his
undying
name
!
 
<EOS>
For
shame
,
gentlemen
;
for
shame
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
unwonted
lines
which
momentary
passion
had
ruled
in
Mr
Pickwick
's
clear
and
open
brow
,
gradually
melted
away
,
as
his
young
friend
spoke
,
like
the
marks
of
a
black
-
lead
pencil
beneath
the
softening
influence
of
india
-
rubber
.
 
<EOS>
His
countenance
had
resumed
its
usual
benign
expression
,
ere
he
concluded
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
hasty
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
very
hasty
.
 
<EOS>
Tupman
;
your
hand
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
dark
shadow
passed
from
Mr
Tupman
's
face
,
as
he
warmly
grasped
the
hand
of
his
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
hasty
,
too
,
"
said
he
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
"
interrupted
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
the
fault
was
mine
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
wear
the
green
velvet
jacket
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
replied
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
oblige
me
,
you
will
,
"
resumed
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
I
will
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
accordingly
settled
that
Mr
Tupman
,
Mr
Winkle
,
and
Mr
Snodgrass
,
should
all
wear
fancy
-
dresses
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
Mr
Pickwick
was
led
by
the
very
warmth
of
his
own
good
feelings
to
give
his
consent
to
a
proceeding
from
which
his
better
judgment
would
have
recoiled
---
a
more
striking
illustration
of
his
amiable
character
could
hardly
have
been
conceived
,
even
if
the
events
recorded
in
these
pages
had
been
wholly
imaginary
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Leo
Hunter
had
not
exaggerated
the
resources
of
Mr
Solomon
Lucas
.
 
<EOS>
His
wardrobe
was
extensive
---
very
extensive
---
not
strictly
classical
perhaps
,
not
quite
new
,
nor
did
it
contain
any
one
garment
made
precisely
after
the
fashion
of
any
age
or
time
,
but
everything
was
more
or
less
spangled
;
and
what
can
be
prettier
than
spangles
!
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
objected
that
they
are
not
adapted
to
the
daylight
,
but
everybody
knows
that
they
would
glitter
if
there
were
lamps
;
and
nothing
can
be
clearer
than
that
if
people
give
fancy
-
balls
in
the
day
-
time
,
and
the
dresses
do
not
show
quite
as
well
as
they
would
by
night
,
the
fault
lies
solely
with
the
people
who
give
the
fancy
-
balls
,
and
is
in
no
wise
chargeable
on
the
spangles
.
 
<EOS>
Such
was
the
convincing
reasoning
of
Mr
Solomon
Lucas
;
and
influenced
by
such
arguments
<EOS>
did
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
,
Mr
Winkle
,
and
Mr
Snodgrass
engage
to
array
themselves
in
costumes
which
his
taste
and
experience
induced
him
to
recommend
as
admirably
suited
to
the
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
A
carriage
was
hired
from
the
Town
Arms
,
for
the
accommodation
of
the
Pickwickians
,
and
a
chariot
was
ordered
from
the
same
repository
,
for
the
purpose
of
conveying
Mr
and
Mrs
Pott
to
Mrs
Leo
Hunter
's
grounds
,
which
Mr
Pott
,
as
a
delicate
acknowledgment
of
having
received
an
invitation
,
had
already
confidently
predicted
in
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
"
would
present
a
scene
of
varied
and
delicious
enchantment
---
a
bewildering
coruscation
of
beauty
and
talent
---
a
lavish
and
prodigal
display
of
hospitality
---
above
all
,
a
degree
of
splendour
softened
by
the
most
exquisite
taste
;
and
adornment
refined
with
perfect
harmony
and
the
chastest
good
keeping
---
compared
with
which
,
the
fabled
gorgeousness
of
Eastern
fairyland
itself
would
appear
to
be
clothed
in
as
many
dark
and
murky
colours
,
as
must
be
the
mind
of
the
splenetic
and
unmanly
being
who
could
presume
to
taint
with
the
venom
of
his
envy
,
the
preparations
made
by
the
virtuous
and
highly
distinguished
lady
at
whose
shrine
this
humble
tribute
of
admiration
was
offered
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
last
was
a
piece
of
biting
sarcasm
against
the
INDEPENDENT
,
who
,
in
consequence
of
not
having
been
invited
at
all
,
had
been
,
through
four
numbers
,
affecting
to
sneer
at
the
whole
affair
,
in
his
very
largest
type
,
with
all
the
adjectives
in
capital
letters
.
   
<EOS>
The
morning
came
:
<EOS>
it
was
a
pleasant
sight
to
behold
Mr
Tupman
in
full
brigand
's
costume
,
with
a
very
tight
jacket
,
sitting
like
a
pincushion
over
his
back
and
shoulders
,
the
upper
portion
of
his
legs
incased
in
the
velvet
shorts
,
and
the
lower
part
thereof
swathed
in
the
complicated
bandages
to
which
all
brigands
are
peculiarly
attached
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
pleasing
to
see
his
open
and
ingenuous
countenance
,
well
mustachioed
and
corked
,
looking
out
from
an
open
shirt
collar
;
and
to
contemplate
the
sugar
-
loaf
hat
,
decorated
with
ribbons
of
all
colours
,
which
he
was
compelled
to
carry
on
his
knee
,
inasmuch
as
no
known
conveyance
with
a
top
to
it
<EOS>
,
would
admit
of
any
man
's
carrying
it
between
his
head
and
the
roof
.
 
<EOS>
Equally
humorous
and
agreeable
was
the
appearance
of
Mr
Snodgrass
in
blue
satin
trunks
and
cloak
,
white
silk
tights
and
shoes
,
and
Grecian
helmet
,
which
everybody
knows
<EOS>
(
and
if
they
do
not
,
Mr
Solomon
Lucas
did
)
to
have
been
the
regular
,
authentic
,
everyday
costume
of
a
troubadour
,
from
the
earliest
ages
down
to
the
time
of
their
final
disappearance
from
the
face
of
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
was
pleasant
,
but
this
was
as
nothing
compared
with
the
shouting
of
the
populace
when
the
carriage
drew
up
,
behind
Mr
Pott
's
chariot
,
which
chariot
itself
drew
up
at
Mr
Pott
's
door
,
which
door
itself
opened
,
and
displayed
the
great
Pott
accoutred
as
a
Russian
officer
of
justice
,
with
a
tremendous
knout
in
his
hand
---
tastefully
typical
of
the
stern
and
mighty
power
of
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
,
and
the
fearful
lashings
it
bestowed
on
public
offenders
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bravo
!
"
shouted
Mr
Tupman
and
Mr
Snodgrass
from
the
passage
,
when
they
beheld
the
walking
allegory
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bravo
!
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
heard
to
exclaim
,
from
the
passage
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hoo
-
roar
Pott
!
"
shouted
the
populace
.
 
<EOS>
Amid
these
salutations
,
Mr
Pott
,
smiling
with
that
kind
of
bland
dignity
which
sufficiently
testified
that
he
felt
his
power
,
and
knew
how
to
exert
it
,
got
into
the
chariot
.
   
<EOS>
Then
there
emerged
from
the
house
,
Mrs
Pott
,
who
would
have
looked
very
like
Apollo
if
she
had
n't
had
a
gown
on
,
conducted
by
Mr
Winkle
,
who
,
in
his
light
-
red
coat
could
not
possibly
have
been
mistaken
for
anything
but
a
sportsman
,
if
he
had
not
borne
an
equal
resemblance
to
a
general
postman
.
 
<EOS>
Last
of
all
came
Mr
Pickwick
,
whom
the
boys
applauded
as
loud
as
anybody
,
probably
under
the
impression
that
his
tights
and
gaiters
were
some
remnants
of
the
dark
ages
;
and
then
the
two
vehicles
proceeded
towards
Mrs
Leo
Hunter
's
;
Mr
Weller
(
who
was
to
assist
in
waiting
)
being
stationed
on
the
box
of
that
in
which
his
master
was
seated
.
   
<EOS>
Every
one
of
the
men
,
women
,
boys
,
girls
,
and
babies
,
who
were
assembled
to
see
the
visitors
in
their
fancy
-
dresses
,
screamed
with
delight
and
ecstasy
,
when
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
the
brigand
on
one
arm
,
and
the
troubadour
on
the
other
,
walked
solemnly
up
the
entrance
.
 
<EOS>
Never
were
such
shouts
heard
as
those
which
greeted
Mr
Tupman
's
efforts
to
fix
the
sugar
-
loaf
hat
on
his
head
,
by
way
of
entering
the
garden
in
style
.
   
<EOS>
The
preparations
were
on
the
most
delightful
scale
;
fully
realising
the
prophetic
Pott
's
anticipations
about
the
gorgeousness
of
Eastern
fairyland
,
and
at
once
affording
a
sufficient
contradiction
to
the
malignant
statements
of
the
reptile
INDEPENDENT
.
<EOS>
The
grounds
were
more
than
an
acre
and
a
quarter
in
extent
,
and
they
were
filled
with
people
!
 
<EOS>
Never
was
such
a
blaze
of
beauty
,
and
fashion
,
and
literature
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
young
lady
who
"
did
"
the
poetry
in
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
,
in
the
garb
of
a
sultana
,
leaning
upon
the
arm
of
the
young
gentleman
who
"
did
"
the
review
department
,
and
who
was
appropriately
habited
in
a
field
-
marshal
's
uniform
---
the
boots
excepted
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
hosts
of
these
geniuses
,
and
any
reasonable
person
would
have
thought
it
honour
enough
to
meet
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
more
than
these
,
there
were
half
a
dozen
lions
from
London
---
authors
,
real
authors
,
who
had
written
whole
books
,
and
printed
them
afterwards
---
and
here
you
might
see
'em
,
walking
about
,
like
ordinary
men
,
smiling
,
and
talking
---
aye
,
and
talking
pretty
considerable
nonsense
too
,
no
doubt
with
the
benign
intention
of
rendering
themselves
intelligible
to
the
common
people
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
Moreover
,
there
was
a
band
of
music
in
pasteboard
caps
;
four
something
-
ean
singers
in
the
costume
of
their
country
,
and
a
dozen
hired
waiters
in
the
costume
of
THEIR
country
---
and
very
dirty
costume
too
.
 
<EOS>
And
above
all
,
there
was
Mrs
Leo
Hunter
in
the
character
of
Minerva
,
receiving
the
company
,
and
overflowing
with
pride
and
gratification
at
the
notion
of
having
called
such
distinguished
individuals
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pickwick
,
ma'am
,
"
said
a
servant
,
as
that
gentleman
approached
the
presiding
goddess
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
and
the
brigand
and
troubadour
on
either
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
Where
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Leo
Hunter
,
starting
up
,
in
an
affected
rapture
of
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
that
I
have
really
the
gratification
of
beholding
Mr
Pickwick
himself
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mrs
Leo
Hunter
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
other
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,

it

you
know

everybody
inquired

And
the

put
up

and
with
sundry

and
acknowledgments
walked
away
,
<EOS>
thoroughly
satisfied
that

had
made

and
valuable

<EOS>
"
Wonderful

<EOS>
"

added
Mr

.
   
<EOS>
A
chorus
of
bystanders
took
up
the
shout
of
Count
Smorltork
's
praise
,
shook
their
heads
sagely
,
and
unanimously
cried
,
"
Very
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
enthusiasm
in
Count
Smorltork
's
favour
ran
very
high
,
his
praises
might
have
been
sung
until
the
end
of
the
festivities
,
if
the
four
something
-
ean
singers
had
not
ranged
themselves
in
front
of
a
small
apple
-
tree
,
to
look
picturesque
,
and
commenced
singing
their
national
songs
,
which
appeared
by
no
means
difficult
of
execution
,
inasmuch
as
the
grand
secret
seemed
to
be
,
that
three
of
the
something
-
ean
singers
should
grunt
,
while
the
fourth
howled
.
 
<EOS>
This
interesting
performance
having
concluded
amidst
the
loud
plaudits
of
the
whole
company
,
a
boy
forthwith
proceeded
to
entangle
himself
with
the
rails
of
a
chair
,
and
to
jump
over
it
,
and
crawl
under
it
,
and
fall
down
with
it
,
and
do
everything
but
sit
upon
it
,
and
then
to
make
a
cravat
of
his
legs
,
and
tie
them
round
his
neck
,
and
then
to
illustrate
the
ease
with
which
a
human
being
can
be
made
to
look
like
a
magnified
toad
 
---
all
which
feats
yielded
high
delight
and
satisfaction
to
the
assembled
spectators
.
 
<EOS>
After
which
,
the
voice
of
Mrs
Pott
was
heard
to
chirp
faintly
forth
,
something
which
courtesy
interpreted
into
a
song
,
which
was
all
very
classical
,
and
strictly
in
character
,
because
Apollo
was
himself
a
composer
,
and
composers
can
very
seldom
sing
their
own
music
or
anybody
else
's
,
either
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
succeeded
by
Mrs
Leo
Hunter
's
recitation
of
her
far
-
famed
"
Ode
to
an
Expiring
Frog
,
"
which
was
encored
once
,
and
would
have
been
encored
twice
,
if
the
major
part
of
the
guests
,
who
thought
it
was
high
time
to
get
something
to
eat
,
had
not
said
that
it
was
perfectly
shameful
to
take
advantage
of
Mrs
Hunter
's
good
nature
.
 
<EOS>
So
although
Mrs
Leo
Hunter
professed
her
perfect
willingness
to
recite
the
ode
again
,
her
kind
and
considerate
friends
would
n't
hear
of
it
on
any
account
;
and
the
refreshment
room
being
thrown
open
,
all
the
people
who
had
ever
been
there
before
,
scrambled
in
with
all
possible
despatch
---
Mrs
Leo
Hunter
's
usual
course
of
proceedings
being
,
to
issue
cards
for
a
hundred
,
and
breakfast
for
fifty
,
or
in
other
words
to
feed
only
the
very
particular
lions
,
and
let
the
smaller
animals
take
care
of
themselves
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where

"
said
Mrs
Leo
Hunter
,
as
she
placed
the
aforesaid
lions
around
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
I
am
,
"
said
the
editor
,
from
the
remotest
end
of
the
room
;
far
beyond
all
hope
of
food
,
unless
something
was
done
for
him
by
the
hostess
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wo

up
here

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

pray
do

"
said
Mrs

,
in
the
most
obliging
voice
---
"
you

replied
the

Pott

with
a
grim
smile

<EOS>
Alas

<EOS>
The
nervous
arm
that
wielded
it
,
with
such
a
gigantic
force
on
public
characters
,
was
paralysed
beneath
the
glance
of
the
imperious
Mrs
Pott
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Leo
Hunter
looked
round
her
in
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
Count
Smorltork
was
busily
engaged
in
taking
notes
of
the
contents
of
the
dishes
;
Mr
Tupman
was
doing
the
honours
of
the
lobster
salad
to
several
lionesses
,
with
a
degree
of
grace
which
no
brigand
ever
exhibited
before
;
Mr
Snodgrass
having
cut
out
the
young
gentleman
who
cut
up
the
books
for
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
,
was
engaged
in
an
impassioned
argument
with
the
young
lady
who
did
the
poetry
;
and
Mr
Pickwick
was
making
himself
universally
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
seemed
wanting
to
render
the
select
circle
complete
,
when
Mr
Leo
Hunter
---
whose
department
on
these
occasions
,
was
to
stand
about
in
doorways
,
and
talk
to
the
less
important
people
---
suddenly
called
out
---
"

<EOS>
"
Oh

<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
knife
and
fork
fell
from
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
stared
across
the
table
at
Mr
Tupman
,
who
had
dropped
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
was
looking
as
if
he
were
about
to
sink
into
the
ground
without
further
notice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah

"
cried
the
voice
,
as
its
owner
pushed
his
way
among
the
last
five
-
and
-
twenty
Turks
,
officers
,
cavaliers
,
and
Charles
the
Seconds
,
that
remained
between

<EOS>
With
these
broken
words
,
a
young
man
dressed
as
a
naval
officer
made
his
way
up
to
the
table
,
and
presented
to
the
astonished
Pickwickians
the
identical
form
and
features
of
Mr
Alfred
Jingle
.
<EOS>
The
offender
had
barely
time
to
take
Mrs
Leo
Hunter
's
proffered
hand
,
when
his
eyes
encountered
the
indignant
orbs
of
Mr

With

words
he
disappeared
among
the
crowd
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will

me
to

said
the
excited
Mr

rising
from

At

<EOS>
"
   
"
At
Bury
St
Edmunds
,
not
many
miles
from
here
.
 
<EOS>
But
dear
me
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
you
are
not
going
to
leave
us
;
surely
Mr
Pickwick
you
can
not
think
of
going
so
soon
?
"
   
<EOS>
But
long
before
Mrs
Leo
Hunter
had
finished
speaking
,
Mr
Pickwick
had
plunged
through
the
throng
,
and
reached
the
garden
,
whither
<EOS>
he
was
shortly
afterwards
joined
by
Mr
Tupman
,
who
had
followed
his
friend
closely
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
of
no
use
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
gone
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
and
I
will
follow
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Follow
him
!
 
<EOS>
Where
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
the
Angel
at
Bury
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
speaking
very
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
we
know
whom
he
is
deceiving
there
?
 
<EOS>
He
deceived
a
worthy
man
once
,
and
we
were
the
innocent
cause
.
 
<EOS>
He
shall
not
do
it
again
,
if
I
can
help
it
;
I
'll
expose
him
!
 
<EOS>
Sam
!
<EOS>
Where
's
my
servant
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
you
are
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
emerging
from
a
sequestered
spot
,
where
he
had
been
engaged
in
discussing
a
bottle
of
Madeira
,
which
he
had
abstracted
from
the
breakfast
-
table
an
hour
or
two
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
your
servant
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
Proud
o
'
<EOS>
the

,
as
the

skellinton
said
,

<EOS>
show'd

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Follow
me
instantly
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tupman
,
if
I
stay
at
Bury
,
you
can
join
me
there
,
when
I
write

<EOS>
Till
then
,
good
-
bye
!
"
   
<EOS>
Remonstrances
were
useless
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
roused
,
and
his
mind
was
made
up
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
returned
to
his
companions
;
and
in
another
hour
had
drowned
all
present
recollection
of
Mr
Alfred
Jingle
,
or
Mr
Charles
Fitz
-
Marshall
,
in
an
exhilarating
quadrille
and
a
bottle
of
champagne
.
 
<EOS>
By
that
time
,
Mr
Pickwick
and
Sam
Weller
,
perched
on
the
outside
of
a
stage
-
coach
,
were
every
succeeding
minute
placing
a
less
and
less
distance
between
themselves
and
the
good
old
town
of
Bury
St
Edmunds
.
    
Chapter

.
<EOS>
Too
full
of
adventure
to
be
briefly
described
 
There
is
no
month
in
the
whole
year
in
which
nature
wears
a
more
beautiful
appearance
than
in
the
month
of
August
.
 
<EOS>
Spring
has
many
beauties
,
and
May
is
a
fresh
and
blooming
month
,
but
the
charms
of
this
time
of
year
are
enhanced
by
their
contrast
with
the
winter
season
.
 
<EOS>
August
has
no
such
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
It
comes
when
we
remember
nothing
but
clear
skies
,
green
fields
,
and
sweet
-
smelling
flowers
---
when
the
recollection
of
snow
,
and
ice
,
and
bleak
winds
,
has
faded
from
our
minds
as
completely
as
they
have
disappeared
from
the
earth
---
and
yet
what
a
pleasant
time
it
is
!
 
<EOS>
Orchards
and
cornfields
ring
with
the
hum
of
labour
;
trees
bend
beneath
the
thick
clusters
of
rich
fruit
which
bow
their
branches
to
the
ground
;
and
the
corn
,
piled
in
graceful
sheaves
,
or
waving
in
every
light
breath
that
sweeps
above
it
,
as
if
it
wooed
the
sickle
,
tinges
the
landscape
with
a
golden
hue
.
 
<EOS>
A
mellow
softness
appears
to
hang
over
the
whole
earth
;
the
influence
of
the
season
seems
to
extend
itself
to
the
very
wagon
,
whose
slow
motion
across
the
well
-
reaped
field
is
perceptible
only
to
the
eye
,
but
strikes
with
no
harsh
sound
upon
the
ear
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
coach
rolls
swiftly
past
the
fields
and
orchards
which
skirt
the
road
,
groups
of
women
and
children
,
piling
the
fruit
in
sieves
,
or
gathering
the
scattered
ears
of
corn
,
pause
for
an
instant
from
their
labour
,
and
shading
the
sun
-
burned
face
with
a
still
browner
hand
,
gaze
upon
the
passengers
with
curious
eyes
,
while
some
stout
urchin
,
too
small
to
work
,
but
too
mischievous
to
be
left
at
home
,
scrambles
over
the
side
of
the
basket
in
which
he
has
been
deposited
for
security
,
and
kicks
and
screams
with
delight
.
 
<EOS>
The
reaper
stops
in
his
work
,
and
stands
with
folded
arms
,
looking
at
the
vehicle
as
it
whirls
past
;
and
the
rough
cart
-
horses
bestow
a
sleepy
glance
upon
the
smart
coach
team
,
which
says
as
plainly
as
a
horse
's
glance
can
,
"
It
's
all
very
fine
to
look
at
,
but
slow
going
,
over
a
heavy
field
,
is
better
than
warm
work
like
that
,
upon
a
dusty
road
,
after
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
You
cast
a
look
behind
you
,
as
you
turn
a
corner
of
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
The
women
and
children
have
resumed
their
labour
;
the
reaper
once
more
stoops
to
his
work
;
the
cart
-
horses
have
moved
on
;
and
all
are
again
in
motion
.
<EOS>
The
influence
of
a
scene
like
this
,
was
not
lost
upon
the
well
-
regulated
mind
of
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
Intent
upon
the
resolution
he
had
formed
,
of
exposing
the
real
character
of
the
nefarious
Jingle
,
in
any
quarter
in
which
he
might
be
pursuing
his
fraudulent
designs
,
he
sat
at
first
taciturn
and
contemplative
,
brooding
over
the
means
by
which
his
purpose
could
be
best
attained
.
 
<EOS>
By
degrees
his
attention
grew
more
and
more
attracted
by
the
objects
around
him
;
and
at
last
he
derived
as
much
enjoyment
from
the
ride
,
as
if
it
had
been
undertaken
for
the
pleasantest
reason
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
"
Delightful
prospect
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Beats

replied
Mr
Weller
,
touching
his
hat
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
have
hardly
seen
anything
but
chimney
-

bricks

said
Mr
Pickwick
,
smiling
.
   
<EOS>
"
I

said
Mr

,
with
a

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
When

<EOS>
inquired
Mr

<EOS>
"
When

I

<EOS>
"
You
are
quite

Sam

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
runs
in

I

replied
Mr

<EOS>
"
My

She
flies
in

Then

A

it

at

replied
Mr

,
laughing

<EOS>
"

exclaimed
Sam

Arter

<EOS>
"
Ah

said
Mr

,
with
an
air
of
considerable
interest

<EOS>
"
Sights

resumed
Mr

<EOS>
And
pray

Sam

what
is
the
twopenny
rope

"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
twopenny
rope
,
sir

"
replied
Mr

,
"
is
just
a

house

where

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
they
call

a

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
your

sir
,
that
ai

"
replied
Sam

<EOS>
"
Ven
the

gen'l'm'n
<EOS>
as
keeps
the
hot

el

used

cos
instead
<EOS>

taking

the

So

"
Is

The
coach
rattled
through
the
well

paved
streets
of
a
handsome
little
town
,
of
thriving
and
cleanly
appearance
,
and
stopped
before

nearly
facing

<EOS>
"
Right

replied
Mr

,
with
a
wink
of
intelligence

having
dragged
Mr
Pickwick

portmanteau
from
the
hind
boot
,
into
which
it
had
been
hastily
thrown
when
they
joined
the
coach
at
Eatanswill
,
Mr
Weller
disappeared
on
his
errand
.
 
<EOS>
A
private
room
was
speedily
engaged
;
and
into
it
Mr
Pickwick
was
ushered
without
delay

"
<EOS>
Now

said
Mr

"
the

Mr

<EOS>
"
I
think

Mr

<EOS>
"
But
I

first
ascertain

<EOS>

Leave

Do

Mr

at

retired

In
half
an
hour
,
Mr
Pickwick
was
seated
at
a
very
satisfactory
dinner
;
and
in
three

quarters
Mr
Weller
returned
with
the
intelligence
that
Mr
Charles
Fitz
-
Marshall
had
ordered
his
private
room
to
be
retained
for
him
,
until
further
notice

<EOS>
He
was
going
to
spend
the
evening
at
some
private
house
in
the
neighbourhood

had
ordered
the
boots
to
sit
up
until
his
return

and
had
taken
his
servant
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
sir
,
"
argued
Mr
Weller
,
when
he
had
concluded
his
report
,
"
if
I
can
get
a
talk
with
this
here
servant
in
the
mornin
'
,
he
'll
tell
me
all
his
master
's
concerns
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
that
?
"
interposed
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
your
heart
,
sir
,
servants
always
do
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
ah
,
I
forgot
that
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
can
arrange
what
's
best
to
be
done
,
sir
,
and
we
can
act
accordingly
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
it
appeared
that
this
was
the
best
arrangement
that
could
be
made
,
it
was
finally
agreed
upon
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
,
by
his
master
's
permission
,
retired
to
spend
the
evening
in
his
own
way
;
and
was
shortly
afterwards
elected
,
by
the
unanimous
voice
of
the
assembled
company
,
into
the
taproom
chair
,
in
which
honourable
post
he
acquitted
himself
so
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
gentlemen
-
frequenters
,
that
their
roars
of
laughter
and
approbation
penetrated
to
Mr
Pickwick
's
bedroom
,
and
shortened
the
term
of
his
natural
rest
by
at
least
three
hours
.
   
<EOS>
Early
on
the
ensuing
morning
,
Mr
Weller
was
dispelling
all
the
feverish
remains
of
the
previous
evening
's
conviviality
,
through
the
instrumentality
of
a
halfpenny
shower
-
bath
(
having
induced
a
young
gentleman
attached
to
the
stable
department
,
by
the
offer
of
that
coin
,
to
pump
over
his
head
and
face
,
until
he
was
perfectly
restored
)
,
when
he
was
attracted
by
the
appearance
of
a
young
fellow
in
mulberry
-
coloured
livery
,
who
was
sitting
on
a
bench
in
the
yard
,
reading
what
appeared
to
be
a
hymn
-
book
,
with
an
air
of
deep
abstraction
,
but
who
occasionally
stole
a
glance
at
the
individual
under
the
pump
,
as
if
he
took
some
interest
in
his
proceedings
,
nevertheless
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
rum
'
un
to
look
at
,
you
are
!
"
thought
Mr
Weller
,
the
first
time
his
eyes
encountered
the
glance
of
the
stranger
in
the
mulberry
suit
,
who
had
a
large
,
sallow
,
ugly
face
,
very
sunken
eyes
,
and
a
gigantic
head
,
from
which
depended
a
quantity
of
lank
black
hair
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
rum
'
un
!
"
thought
Mr
Weller
;
and
thinking
this
,
he
went
on
washing
himself
,
and
thought
no
more
about
him
.
   
<EOS>
Still
the
man
kept
glancing
from
his
hymn
-
book
to
Sam
,
and
from
Sam
to
his
hymn
-
book
,
as
if
he
wanted
to
open
a
conversation
.
<EOS>
So
at
last
,
Sam
,
by
way
of
giving
him
an
opportunity
,
said
with
a
familiar
nod
---
   
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
,
governor
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
happy
to
say
,
I
am
pretty
well
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
man
,
speaking
with
great
deliberation
,
and
closing
the
book
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
are
the
same
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
if
I
felt
less
like
a
walking
brandy
-
bottle
<EOS>
I
should
n't
be
quite
so
staggery
this
mornin
'
,
"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
stoppin
'
in
this
house
,
old
'
un
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
mulberry
man
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
was
it
you
worn't
<EOS>
one
of
us
,
last
night
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
,
scrubbing
his
face
with
the
towel
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
seem
one
of
the
jolly
sort
 
---
looks
as
conwivial
as
a
live
trout
in
a
lime
basket
,
"
added
Mr
Weller
,
in
an
undertone
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
out
last
night
with
my
master
,
"
replied
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
his
name
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Weller
,
colouring
up
very
red
with
sudden
excitement
,
and
the
friction
of
the
towel
combined
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fitz
-
Marshall
,
"
said
the
mulberry
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Give
us
your
hand
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
advancing
;
"
I
should
like
to
know
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
your
appearance
,
old
fellow
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
that
is
very
strange
,
"
said
the
mulberry
man
,
with
great
simplicity
of
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
like
yours
so
much
,
that
I
wanted
to
speak
to
you
,
from
the
very
first
moment
I
saw
you
under
the
pump
.
"
<EOS>
"
Did
you
though
?
"
   
"
Upon
my
word
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
is
n't
that
curious
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
sing'ler
,
"
said
Sam
,
inwardly
congratulating
himself
upon
the
softness
of
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
your
name
,
my
patriarch
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Job
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
a
wery
good
name
it
is
;
only
one
I
know
that
ai
n't
got
a
nickname
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
other
name
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Trotter
,
"
said
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
yours
?
"
   
<EOS>
Sam
bore
in
mind
his
master
's
caution
,
and
replied
---
   
<EOS>
"
My
name
's
Walker
;
my
master
's
name
's
Wilkins
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
take
a
drop
<EOS>
o
'
somethin'
<EOS>
this
mornin
'
,
Mr
Trotter
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Trotter
acquiesced
in
this
agreeable
proposal
;
and
having
deposited
his
book
in
his
coat
pocket
,
accompanied
Mr
Weller
to
the
tap
,
where
they
were
soon
occupied
in
discussing
an
exhilarating
compound
,
formed
by
mixing
together
,
in
a
pewter
vessel
,
certain
quantities
of
British
Hollands
and
the
fragrant
essence
of
the
clove
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
sort
of
a
place
have
you
got
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
,
as
he
filled
his
companion
's
glass
,
for
the
second
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bad
,
"
said
Job
,
smacking
his
lips
,
"
very
bad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
that
?
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Worse
than
that
,
my
master
's
going
to
be
married
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
and
worse
than
that
,
too
,
he
's
going
to
run
away
with
an
immense
rich
heiress
,
from
boarding
-
school
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
dragon
!
"
said
Sam
,
refilling
his
companion
's
glass
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
some
boarding
-
school
in
this
town
,
I
suppose
,
ai
n't
it
?
"
<EOS>
Now
,
although
this
question
was
put
in
the
most
careless
tone
imaginable
,
Mr
Job
Trotter
plainly
showed
by
gestures
that
he
perceived
his
new
friend
's
anxiety
to
draw
forth
an
answer
to
it
.
<EOS>
He
emptied
his
glass
,
looked
mysteriously
at
his
companion
,
winked
both
of
his
small
eyes
,
one
after
the
other
,
and
finally
made
a
motion
with
his
arm
,
as
if
he
were
working
an
imaginary
pump
-
handle
;
thereby
intimating
that
he
(
Mr
Trotter
)
considered
himself
as
undergoing
the
process
of
being
pumped
by
Mr
Samuel
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Mr
Trotter
,
in
conclusion
,
"
that
's
not
to
be
told
to
everybody
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
a
secret
---
a
great
secret
,
Mr
Walker
.
<EOS>
"
As
the
mulberry
man
said
this
,
he
turned
his
glass
upside
down
,
by
way
of
reminding
his
companion
that
he
had
nothing
left
wherewith
to
slake
his
thirst
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
observed
the
hint
;
and
feeling
the
delicate
manner
in
which
it
was
conveyed
,
ordered
the
pewter
vessel
to
be
refilled
,
whereat
the
small
eyes
of
the
mulberry
man
glistened
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
it
's
a
secret
?
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
rather
suspect
it
was
,
"
said
the
mulberry
man
,
sipping
his
liquor
,
with
a
complacent
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
i
suppose
your
mas'r
's
wery
rich
?
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Trotter
smiled
,
and
holding
his
glass
in
his
left
hand
,
gave
four
distinct
slaps
on
the
pockets
of
his
mulberry
indescribables
with
his
right
,
as
if
to
intimate
that
his
master
might
have
done
the
same
without
alarming
anybody
much
by
the
chinking
of
coin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
that
's
the
game
,
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
mulberry
man
nodded
significantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
do
n't
you
think
,
old
feller
,
"
remonstrated
Mr
Weller
,
"
<EOS>
that
if
you
let
your
master
take
in
this
here
young
lady
,
you
're
a
precious
rascal
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
,
"
said
Job
Trotter
,
turning
upon
his
companion
a
countenance
of
deep
contrition
,
and
groaning
slightly
,
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
,
and
that
's
what
it
is
that
preys
upon
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
am
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
!
"
<EOS>
said
Sam
;
"
di
-
wulge
to
the
missis
,
and
give
up
your
master
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
'd
believe
me
?
"
replied
Job
Trotter
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
young
lady
's
considered
the
very
picture
of
innocence
and
discretion
.
 
<EOS>
She
'd
deny
it
,
and
so
would
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
Who
'd
believe
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
should
lose
my
place
,
and
get
indicted
for
a
conspiracy
,
or
some
such
thing
;
that
's
all
I
should
take
by
my
motion
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
somethin'
in
that
,
"
said
Sam
,
ruminating
;
"
there
's
somethin'
in
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
knew
any
respectable
gentleman
who
would
take
the
matter
up
,
"
continued
Mr
Trotter
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
might
have
some
hope
of
preventing
the
elopement
;
but
there
's
the
same
difficulty
,
Mr
Walker
,
just
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
no
gentleman
in
this
strange
place
;
and
ten
to
one
if
I
did
,
whether
he
would
believe
my
story
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
this
way
,
"
said
Sam
,
suddenly
jumping
up
,
and
grasping
the
mulberry
man
by
the
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
mas'r
's
the
man
you
want
,
I
see
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
after
a
slight
resistance
on
the
part
of
Job
Trotter
,
Sam
led
his
newly
-
found
friend
to
the
apartment
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
to
whom
he
presented
him
,
together
with
a
brief
summary
of
the
dialogue
we
have
just
repeated
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
to
betray
my
master
,
sir
,
"
said
Job
Trotter
,
applying
to
his
eyes
a
pink
checked
pocket
-
handkerchief
about
six
inches
square
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
feeling
does
you
a
great
deal
of
honour
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
but
it
is
your
duty
,
nevertheless
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
is
my
duty
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Job
,
with
great
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
We
should
all
try
to
discharge
our
duty
,
Sir
,
and
I
humbly
endeavour
to
discharge
mine
,
Sir
;
but
it
is
a
hard
trial
to
betray
a
master
,
Sir
,
whose
clothes
you
wear
,
and
whose
bread
you
eat
,
even
though
he
is
a
scoundrel
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
very
good
fellow
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
much
affected
;
"
an
honest
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
"
interposed
Sam
,
who
had
witnessed
Mr
Trotter
's
tears
with
considerable
impatience
,
"
blow
this
'
ere
water
-
cart
bis'ness
.
 
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
do
no
good
,
this
wo
n't
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
reproachfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
find
that
you
have
so
little
respect
for
this
young
man
's
feelings
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
His
feelin
's
is
all
wery
well
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
;
"
and
as
they
're
so
wery
fine
,
and
it
's
a
pity
he
should
lose
'em
<EOS>
,
I
think
he
'd
better
keep
'em
in
his
own
buzzum
,
than
let
'em
ewaporate
in
hot
water
,
"
specially
as
they
do
no
good
.
 
<EOS>
Tears
never
yet
wound
up
a
clock
,
or
worked
a
steam
ingin
'
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
time
you
go
out
to
a
smoking
party
,
young
fellow
,
fill
your
pipe
with
that
'
ere
reflection
;
and
for
the
present
just
put
that
bit
of
pink
gingham
into
your
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tain't
so
handsome
that
you
need
keep
waving
it
about
,
as
if
you
was
a
tight
-
rope
dancer
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
man
is
in
the
right
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
accosting
Job
,
"
although
his
mode
of
expressing
his
opinion
is
somewhat
homely
,
and
occasionally
incomprehensible
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
,
sir
,
very
right
,
"
said
Mr
Trotter
,
"
and
I
will
give
way
no
longer
.
"
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
where
is
this
boarding
-
school
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
large
,
old
,
red
brick
house
,
just
outside
the
town
,
Sir

"
replied
Job
Trotter
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
---
"
<EOS>
when
is
this
villainous
design
to
be
carried
into
execution

<EOS>
when
is
this
elopement
to
take
place
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
To

night

Sir

replied
Job
.
   
<EOS>
"
To

night

exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
very
night

replied
Job
Trotter
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
what
alarms
me
so
much

"
   
<EOS>
"
Instant
measures
must
be
taken

said
Mr
Pickwick

<EOS>
"
I
will
see

keeps
the
establishment
immediately

<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Sir
,
"
said
Job
,
"
but
that
course
of
proceeding
will
never
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
master
,
sir
,
is
a
very
artful
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
is
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
he
has
so
wound
himself
round
the
old
lady
's
heart
,
Sir
,
"
resumed
Job
,
"
that
she
would
believe
nothing
to
his
prejudice
,
if
you
went
down
on
your
bare
knees
,
and
swore
it
;
especially
as
you
have
no
proof
but
the
word
of
a
servant
,
who
,
for
anything
she
knows
(
and
my
master
would
be
sure
to
say
so
)
,
was
discharged
for
some
fault
,
and
does
this
in
revenge
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
had
better
be
done
,
then
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nothing
but
taking
him
in
the
very
act
of
eloping
,
will
convince
the
old
lady
,
sir
,
"
replied
Job
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
them
old
cats
WILL
run
their
heads
agin
milestones
,
"
observed
Mr
Weller
,
in
a
parenthesis
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
this
taking
him
in
the
very
act
of
elopement
,
would
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
accomplish
,
I
fear
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Trotter
,
after
a
few
moments
"
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
might
be
very
easily
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
was
Mr
Pickwick
's
inquiry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
replied
Mr
Trotter
,
"
my
master
and
I
,
being
in
the
confidence
of
the
two
servants
,
will
be
secreted
in
the
kitchen
at
ten
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
family
have
retired
to
rest
,
we
shall
come
out
of
the
kitchen
,
and
the
young
lady
out
of
her
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
A
post
-
chaise
will
be
waiting
,
and
away
we
go
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
I
have
been
thinking
that
if
you
were
in
waiting
in
the
garden
behind
,
alone
---
"
   
"
Alone
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
alone
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
very
natural
,
"
replied
Job
,
"
that
the
old
lady
would
n't
like
such
an
unpleasant
discovery
to
be
made
before
more
persons
than
can
possibly
be
helped
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
lady
,
too
,
sir
---
consider
her
feelings
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
right
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
consideration
evinces
your
delicacy
of
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
Go
on
;
you
are
very
right
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
I
have
been
thinking
that
if
you
were
waiting
in
the
back
garden
alone
,
and
I
was
to
let
you
in
,
at
the
door
which
opens
into
it
,
from
the
end
of
the
passage
,
at
exactly
half
-
past
eleven
o'clock
,
you
would
be
just
in
the
very
moment
of
time
to
assist
me
in
frustrating
the
designs
of
this
bad
man
,
by
whom
I
have
been
unfortunately
ensnared
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Trotter
sighed
deeply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
distress
yourself
on
that
account
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
if
he
had
one
grain
of
the
delicacy
of
feeling
which
distinguishes
you
,
humble
as
your
station
is
,
I
should
have
some
hopes
of
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Job
Trotter
bowed
low
;
and
in
spite
of
Mr
Weller
's
previous
remonstrance
,
the
tears
again
rose
to
his
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
such
a
feller
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
<EOS>
Blessed
if
I
do
n't
think
he
's
got
a
main
in
his
head
as
is
always
turned
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
great
severity
,
"
hold
your
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
this
plan
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
after
deep
meditation
.
<EOS>
"
Why
can
not
I
communicate
with
the
young
lady
's
friends
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
they
live
one
hundred
miles
from
here
,
sir
,
"
responded
Job
Trotter
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
clincher
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
aside
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
this
garden
,
"
resumed
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
am
I
to
get
into
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
wall
is
very
low
,
sir
,
and
your
servant
will
give
you
a
leg
up
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
servant
will
give
me
a
leg
up
,
"
repeated
Mr
Pickwick
mechanically
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
sure
to
be
near
this
door
that
you
speak
of
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
mistake
it
,
Sir
;
it
's
the
only
one
that
opens
into
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
Tap
at
it
when
you
hear
the
clock
strike
,
and
I
will
open
it
instantly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
the
plan
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
<EOS>
but
as
I
see
no
other
,
and
as
the
happiness
of
this
young
lady
's
whole
life
is
at
stake
,
I
adopt
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
sure
to
be
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
,
for
the
second
time
,
did
Mr
Pickwick
's
innate
good
-
feeling
involve
him
in
an
enterprise
from
which
he
would
most
willingly
have
stood
aloof
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
name
of
the
house
?
"
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Westgate
House
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
turn
a
little
to
the
right
when
you
get
to
the
end
of
the
town
;
it
stands
by
itself
,
some
little
distance
off
the
high
road
,
with
the
name
on
a
brass
plate
on
the
gate
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
observed
it
once
before
,
when
I
was
in
this
town
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
depend
upon
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Trotter
made
another
bow
,
and
turned
to
depart
,
when
Mr
Pickwick
thrust
a
guinea
into
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
fine
fellow
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
and
I
admire
your
goodness
of
heart
.
 
<EOS>
No
thanks
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
---
eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
fear
of
my
forgetting
it
,
sir
,
"
replied
Job
Trotter
.
<EOS>
With
these
words
he
left
the
room
,
followed
by
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
said
the
latter
,
"
not
a
bad
notion
that
'
ere
crying
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
cry
like
a
rain
-
water
spout
in
a
shower
on
such
good
terms
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
comes
from
the
heart
,
Mr
Walker
,
"
replied
Job
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
-
morning
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
soft
customer
<EOS>
,
you
are
;
we
've
got
it
all
out
<EOS>
o
'
you
,
anyhow
,
"
thought
Mr
Weller
,
as
Job
walked
away
.
   
<EOS>
We
can
not
state
the
precise
nature
of
the
thoughts
which
passed
through
Mr
Trotter
's
mind
,
because
we
do
n't
know
what
they
were
.
   
<EOS>
The
day
wore
on
,
evening
came
,
and
at
a
little
before
ten
o'clock
Sam
Weller
reported
that
Mr
Jingle
and
Job
had
gone
out
together
,
that
their
luggage
was
packed
up
,
and
that
they
had
ordered
a
chaise
.
 
<EOS>
The
plot
was
evidently
in
execution
,
as
Mr
Trotter
had
foretold
.
   
<EOS>
Half
-
past
ten
o'clock
arrived
,
and
it
was
time
for
Mr
Pickwick
to
issue
forth
on
his
delicate
errand
.
 
<EOS>
Resisting
Sam
's
tender
of
his
greatcoat
,
in
order
that
he
might
have
no
encumbrance
in
scaling
the
wall
<EOS>
,
he
set
forth
,
followed
by
his
attendant
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
bright
moon
,
but
it
was
behind
the
clouds
.
 
<EOS>
it
was
a
fine
dry
night
,
but
it
was
most
uncommonly
dark
.
 
<EOS>
Paths
,
hedges
,
fields
,
houses
,
and
trees
,
were
enveloped
in
one
deep
shade
.
 
<EOS>
The
atmosphere
was
hot
and
sultry
,
the
summer
lightning
quivered
faintly
on
the
verge
of
the
horizon
,
and
was
the
only
sight
that
varied
the
dull
gloom
in
which
everything
was
wrapped
 
---
sound
there
was
none
,
except
the
distant
barking
of
some
restless
house
-
dog
.
   
<EOS>
They
found
the
house
,
read
the
brass
plate
,
walked
round
the
wall
,
and
stopped
at
that
portion
of
it
which
divided
them
from
the
bottom
of
the
garden
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
return
to
the
inn
,
Sam
,
when
you
have
assisted
me
over
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
well
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
sit
up
,
till
I
return
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cert'nly
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Take
hold
of
my
leg
;
and
,
when
I
say
"
Over
,
"
raise
me
gently
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Having
settled
these
preliminaries
,
Mr
Pickwick
grasped
the
top
of
the
wall
,
and
gave
the
word
"
Over
,
"
which
was
literally
obeyed
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
his
body
partook
in
some
degree
of
the
elasticity
of
his
mind
,
or
whether
Mr
Weller
's
notions
of
a
gentle
push
were
of
a
somewhat
rougher
description
than
Mr
Pickwick
's
,
the
immediate
effect
of
his
assistance
was
to
jerk
that
immortal
gentleman
completely
over
the
wall
on
to
the
bed
<EOS>
beneath
,
where
,
after
crushing
three
gooseberry
-
bushes
and
a
rose
-
tree
,
he
finally
alighted
at
full
length
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
ha'n't
hurt
yourself
,
I
hope
,
Sir
?
"
said
Sam
,
in
a
loud
whisper
,
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
from
the
surprise
consequent
upon
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
his
master
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
hurt
MYSELF
,
Sam
,
certainly
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
from
the
other
side
of
the
wall
,
"
but
I
rather
think
that
YOU
have
hurt
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
Sir
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
rising
,
"
<EOS>
it
's
nothing
but
a
few
scratches
.
 
<EOS>
Go
away
,
or
we
shall
be
overheard
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
stealthy
steps
Sam
Weller
departed
,
leaving
Mr
Pickwick
alone
in
the
garden
.
   
<EOS>
Lights
occasionally
appeared
in
the
different
windows
of
the
house
,
or
glanced
from
the
staircases
,
as
if
the
inmates
were
retiring
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Not
caring
to
go
too
near
the
door
,
until
the
appointed
time
,
Mr
Pickwick
crouched
into
an
angle
of
the
wall
,
and
awaited
its
arrival
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
situation
which
might
well
have
depressed
the
spirits
of
many
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
however
,
felt
neither
depression
nor
misgiving
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
that
his
purpose
was
in
the
main
a
good
one
,
and
he
placed
implicit
reliance
on
the
high
-
minded
Job
.
 
<EOS>
it
was
dull
,
certainly
;
not
to
say
dreary
;
but
a
contemplative
man
can
always
employ
himself
in
meditation
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
had
meditated
himself
into
a
doze
,
when
he
was
roused
by
the
chimes
of
the
neighbouring
church
ringing
out
the
hour
---
half
-
past
eleven
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
time
,
"
thought
Mr
Pickwick
,
getting
cautiously
on
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
up
at
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
lights
had
disappeared
,
and
the
shutters
were
closed
---
all
in
bed
,
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
He
walked
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
,
and
gave
a
gentle
tap
.
 
<EOS>
Two
or
three
minutes
passing
without
any
reply
,
he
gave
another
tap
rather
louder
,
and
then
another
rather
louder
than
that
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
the
sound
of
feet
was
audible
upon
the
stairs
,
and
then
the
light
of
a
candle
shone
through
the
keyhole
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
good
deal
of
unchaining
and
unbolting
,
and
the
door
was
slowly
opened
.
   
<EOS>
Now
the
door
opened
outwards
;
and
as
the
door
opened
wider
and
wider
,
Mr
Pickwick
receded
behind
it
,
more
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
his
astonishment
when
he
just
peeped
out
,
by
way
of
caution
,
to
see
that
the
person
who
had
opened
it
was
---
not
Job
Trotter
,
but
a
servant
-
girl
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
drew
in
his
head
again
,
with
the
swiftness
displayed
by
that
admirable
melodramatic
performer
,
Punch
,
when
he
lies
in
wait
for
the
flat
-
headed
comedian
with
the
tin
box
of
music
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
must
have
been
the
cat
,
Sarah
,
"
said
the
girl
,
addressing
herself
to
some
one
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
Puss
,
puss
,
puss
,
---
tit
,
tit
,
tit
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
no
animal
being
decoyed
by
these
blandishments
,
the
girl
slowly
closed
the
door
,
and
re
-
fastened
it
;
leaving
Mr
Pickwick
drawn
up
straight
against
the
wall
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
very
curious
,
"
thought
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
sitting
up
beyond
their
usual
hour
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
Extremely
unfortunate
,
that
they
should
have
chosen
this
night
,
of
all
others
,
for
such
a
purpose
---
exceedingly
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
these
thoughts
,
Mr
Pickwick
cautiously
retired
to
the
angle
of
the
wall
in
which
he
had
been
before
ensconced
;
waiting
until
such
time
as
he
might
deem
it
safe
to
repeat
the
signal
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
here
five
minutes
,
when
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
was
followed
by
a
loud
peal
of
thunder
that
crashed
and
rolled
away
in
the
distance
with
a
terrific
noise
---
then
came
another
flash
of
lightning
,
brighter
than
the
other
,
and
a
second
peal
of
thunder
louder
than
the
first
;
and
then
down
came
the
rain
,
with
a
force
and
fury
that
swept
everything
before
it
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
perfectly
aware
that
a
tree
is
a
very
dangerous
neighbour
in
a
thunderstorm
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
tree
on
his
right
,
a
tree
on
his
left
,
a
third
before
him
,
and
a
fourth
behind
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
remained
where
he
was
,
he
might
fall
the
victim
of
an
accident
;
if
he
showed
himself
in
the
centre
of
the
garden
,
he
might
be
consigned
to
a
constable
.
 
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
he
tried
to
scale
the
wall
,
but
having
no
other
legs
this
time
,
than
those
with
which
Nature
had
furnished
him
,
the
only
effect
of
his
struggles
was
to
inflict
a
variety
of
very
unpleasant
gratings
on
his
knees
and
shins
,
and
to
throw
him
into
a
state
of
the
most
profuse
perspiration
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
dreadful
situation
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
pausing
to
wipe
his
brow
after
this
exercise
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
up
at
the
house
---
all
was
dark
.
 
<EOS>
They
must
be
gone
to
bed
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
try
the
signal
again
.
   
<EOS>
He
walked
on
tiptoe
across
the
moist
gravel
,
and
tapped
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
his
breath
,
and
listened
at
the
key
-
hole
.
 
<EOS>
No
reply
:
very
odd
.
 
<EOS>
Another
knock
.
 
<EOS>
He
listened
again
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
low
whispering
inside
,
and
then
a
voice
cried
---
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
Job
,
"
thought
Mr
Pickwick
,
hastily
drawing
himself
straight
up
against
the
wall
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
woman
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
had
time
to
form
this
conclusion
,
when
a
window
above
stairs
was
thrown
up
,
and
three
or
four
female
voices
repeated
the
query
---
"
Who
's
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
dared
not
move
hand
or
foot
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
clear
that
the
whole
establishment
was
roused
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
up
his
mind
to
remain
where
he
was
,
until
the
alarm
had
subsided
;
and
then
by
a
supernatural
effort
,
to
get
over
the
wall
,
or
perish
in
the
attempt
.
   
<EOS>
Like
all
Mr
Pickwick
's
determinations
,
this
was
the
best
that
could
be
made
under
the
circumstances
;
but
,
unfortunately
,
it
was
founded
upon
the
assumption
that
they
would
not
venture
to
open
the
door
again
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
his
discomfiture
,
when
he
heard
the
chain
and
bolts
withdrawn
,
and
saw
the
door
slowly
opening
,
wider
and
wider
!
 
<EOS>
He
retreated
into
the
corner
,
step
by
step
;
but
do
what
he
would
,
the
interposition
of
his
own
person
,
prevented
its
being
opened
to
its
utmost
width
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
there
?
"
<EOS>
screamed
a
numerous
chorus
of
treble
voices
from
the
staircase
inside
,
consisting
of
the
spinster
lady
of
the
establishment
,
three
teachers
,
five
female
servants
,
and
thirty
boarders
,
all
half
-
dressed
and
in
a
forest
of
curl
-
papers
.
   
<EOS>
Of
course
Mr
Pickwick
did
n't
say
who
was
there
:
and
then
the
burden
of
the
chorus
changed
into
<EOS>
---
"
Lor
!
<EOS>
I
am
so
frightened
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cook
,
"
said
the
lady
abbess
,
who
took
care
to
be
on
the
top
stair
,
the
very
last
of
the
group
---
"
cook
,
why
do
n't
you
go
a
little
way
into
the
garden
?
"
<EOS>
"
Please
,
ma'am
,
I
do
n't
like
,
"
responded
the
cook
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
,
what
a
stupid
thing
that
cook
is
!
"
said
the
thirty
boarders
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cook
,
"
said
the
lady
abbess
,
with
great
dignity
;
"
do
n't
answer
me
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
insist
upon
your
looking
into
the
garden
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Here
the
cook
began
to
cry
,
and
the
housemaid
said
it
was
"
a
shame
!
"
<EOS>
for
which
partisanship
she
received
a
month
's
warning
on
the
spot
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
,
cook
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
lady
abbess
,
stamping
her
foot
impatiently
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
hear
your
missis
,
cook
?
"
said
the
three
teachers
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
an
impudent
thing
that
cook
is
!
"
said
the
thirty
boarders
.
   
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
cook
,
thus
strongly
urged
,
advanced
a
step
or
two
,
and
holding
her
candle
just
where
it
prevented
her
from
seeing
at
all
,
declared
there
was
nothing
there
,
and
it
must
have
been
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
was
just
going
to
be
closed
in
consequence
,
when
an
inquisitive
boarder
,
who
had
been
peeping
between
the
hinges
,
set
up
a
fearful
screaming
,
which
called
back
the
cook
and
housemaid
,
and
all
the
more
adventurous
,
in
no
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
with
Miss
Smithers
?
"
said
the
lady
abbess
,
as
the
aforesaid
Miss
Smithers
proceeded
to
go
into
hysterics
of
four
young
lady
power
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
,
Miss
Smithers
,
dear
,
"
said
the
other
nine
-
and
-
twenty
boarders
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
the
man
---
the
man
---
behind
the
door
!
"
screamed
Miss
Smithers
.
   
<EOS>
The
lady
abbess
no
sooner
heard
this
appalling
cry
,
than
she
retreated
to
her
own
bedroom
,
double
-
locked
the
door
,
and
fainted
away
comfortably
.
 
<EOS>
The
boarders
,
and
the
teachers
,
and
the
servants
,
fell
back
upon
the
stairs
,
and
upon
each
other
;
and
never
was
such
a
screaming
,
and
fainting
,
and
struggling
beheld
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
tumult
,
Mr
Pickwick
emerged
from
his
concealment
,
and
presented
himself
amongst
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ladies
---
dear
ladies
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
.
 
<EOS>
he
says
we
're
dear
,
"
cried
the
oldest
and
ugliest
teacher
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
the
wretch
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ladies
,
"
roared
Mr
Pickwick
,
rendered
desperate
by
the
danger
of
his
situation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
no
robber
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
the
lady
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
a
ferocious
monster
!
<EOS>
"
screamed
another
teacher
.
"
<EOS>
He
wants
Miss
Tomkins
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
there
was
a
general
scream
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ring
the
alarm
bell
,
somebody
!
"
<EOS>
cried
a
dozen
voices
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
---
do
n't
,
"
shouted
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
Do
I
look
like
a
robber
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
ladies
---
you
may
bind
me
hand
and
leg
,
or
lock
me
up
in
a
closet
,
if
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
Only
hear
what
I
have
got
to
say
---
only
hear
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
did
you
come
in
our
garden
?
"
<EOS>
faltered
the
housemaid
.
   
<EOS>
"
Call
the
lady
of
the
house
,
and
I
'll
tell
her
everything
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
exerting
his
lungs
to
the
utmost
pitch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Call
her
---
only
be
quiet
,
and
call
her
,
and
you
shall
hear
everything
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
Mr
Pickwick
's
appearance
,
or
it
might
have
been
his
manner
,
or
it
might
have
been
the
temptation
---
irresistible
to
a
female
mind
---
of
hearing
something
at
present
enveloped
in
mystery
,
that
reduced
the
more
reasonable
portion
of
the
establishment
(
some
four
individuals
)
to
a
state
of
comparative
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
By
them
it
was
proposed
,
as
a
test
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
sincerity
,
that
he
should
immediately
submit
to
personal
restraint
;
and
that
gentleman
having
consented
to
hold
a
conference
with
Miss
Tomkins
,
from
the
interior
of
a
closet
in
which
the
day
boarders
hung
their
bonnets
and
sandwich
-
bags
,
he
at
once
stepped
into
it
,
of
his
own
accord
,
and
was
securely
locked
in
.
 
<EOS>
This
revived
the
others
;
and
Miss
Tomkins
having
been
brought
to
,
and
brought
down
,
the
conference
began
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
do
in
my
garden
,
man
?
"
said
Miss
Tomkins
,
in
a
faint
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
came
to
warn
you
that
one
of
your
young
ladies
was
going
to
elope
to
-
night
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
from
the
interior
of
the
closet
.
   
<EOS>
"
Elope
!
"
exclaimed
Miss
Tomkins
,
the
three
teachers
,
the
thirty
boarders
,
and
the
five
servants
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
with
?
"
<EOS>
"
Your
friend
,
Mr
Charles
Fitz
-
Marshall
.
"
   
"
MY
friend
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
any
such
person
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr
Jingle
,
then
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
the
name
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
I
have
been
deceived
,
and
deluded
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
the
victim
of
a
conspiracy
---
a
foul
and
base
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
Send
to
the
Angel
,
my
dear
ma'am
,
if
you
do
n't
believe
me
.
<EOS>
Send
to
the
Angel
for
Mr
Pickwick
's
manservant
,
I
implore
you
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
respectable
---
he
keeps
a
manservant
,
"
said
Miss
Tomkins
to
the
writing
and
ciphering
governess
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
opinion
,
Miss
Tomkins
,
"
said
the
writing
and
ciphering
governess
,
"
that
his
manservant
keeps
him
<EOS>
,
I
think
he
's
a
madman
,
Miss
Tomkins
,
and
the
other
's
his
keeper
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
are
very
right
,
Miss
Gwynn
,
"
responded
Miss
Tomkins
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
two
of
the
servants
repair
to
the
Angel
,
and
let
the
others
remain
here
,
to
protect
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
two
of
the
servants
were
despatched
to
the
Angel
in
search
of
Mr
Samuel
Weller
;
and
the
remaining
three
stopped
behind
to
protect
Miss
Tomkins
,
and
the
three
teachers
,
and
the
thirty
boarders
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mr
Pickwick
sat
down
in
the
closet
,
beneath
a
grove
of
sandwich
-
bags
,
and
awaited
the
return
of
the
messengers
,
with
all
the
philosophy
and
fortitude
he
could
summon
to
his
aid
.
   
<EOS>
An
hour
and
a
half
elapsed
before
they
came
back
,
and
when
they
did
come
<EOS>
,
Mr
Pickwick
recognised
,
in
addition
to
the
voice
of
Mr
Samuel
Weller
,
two
other
voices
,
the
tones
of
which
struck
familiarly
on
his
ear
;
but
whose
they
were
,
he
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
call
to
mind
.
   
<EOS>
A
very
brief
conversation
ensued
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
was
unlocked
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
stepped
out
of
the
closet
,
and
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
establishment
of
Westgate
House
,
Mr
Samuel
Weller
,
and
---
old
Wardle
,
and
his
destined
son
-
in
-
law
,
Mr
Trundle
!
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
running
forward
and
grasping
Wardle
's
hand
,
"
my
dear
friend
,
pray
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
explain
to
this
lady
the
unfortunate
and
dreadful
situation
in
which
I
am
placed
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
have
heard
it
from
my
servant
;
say
,
at
all
events
,
<EOS>
my
dear
fellow
,
that
I
am
neither
a
robber
nor
a
madman
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
so
,
my
dear
friend
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
said
so
already
,
"
replied
Mr
Wardle
,
shaking
the
right
hand
of
his
friend
,
while
Mr
Trundle
shook
the
left
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
whoever
says
,
or
has
said
,
he
is
,
"
interposed
Mr
Weller
,
stepping
forward
,
"
says
that
which
is
not
the
truth
,
but
so
far
from
it
,
on
the
contrary
,
quite
the
rewerse
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
there
's
any
number
o
<EOS>
'
men
on
these
here
premises
as
has
said
so
,
I
shall
be
wery
happy
to
give
'em
all
a
wery
<EOS>
convincing
proof
<EOS>
o
'
their
being
mistaken
,
in
this
here
wery
room
,
if
these
wery
respectable
ladies
"
ll
have
the
goodness
to
retire
,
and
order
'em
up
,
one
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
"
Having
delivered
this
defiance
with
great
volubility
,
Mr
Weller
struck
his
open
palm
emphatically
with
his
clenched
fist
,
and
winked
pleasantly
on
Miss
Tomkins
,
the
intensity
of
whose
horror
at
his
supposing
it
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
there
could
be
any
men
on
the
premises
of
Westgate
House
Establishment
for
Young
Ladies
,
it
is
impossible
to
describe
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
explanation
having
already
been
partially
made
,
was
soon
concluded
.
 
<EOS>
But
neither
in
the
course
of
his
walk
home
with
his
friends
,
nor
afterwards
when
seated
before
a
blazing
fire
at
the
supper
he
so
much
needed
,
could
a
single
observation
be
drawn
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
bewildered
and
amazed
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
and
only
once
,
he
turned
round
to
Mr
Wardle
,
and
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
How
did
you
come
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Trundle
and
I
came
down
here
,
for
some
good
shooting
on
the
first
,
"
replied
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
arrived
to
-
night
,
and
were
astonished
to
hear
from
your
servant
that
you
were
here
too
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
glad
you
are
,
"
said
the
old
fellow
,
slapping
him
on
the
back
---
"
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
have
a
jovial
party
on
the
first
,
and
we
'll
give
Winkle

Showing
that
an
attack
of
rheumatism
,
in
some
cases
,
acts
as
a
quickener
to
inventive
genius
 
<EOS>
The
constitution
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
though
able
to
sustain
a
very
considerable
amount
of
exertion
and
fatigue
,
was
not
proof
against
such
a
combination
of
attacks
as
he
had
undergone
on
the
memorable
night
,
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
.
 
<EOS>
The
process
of
being
washed
in

is

as
it
is
peculiar
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
laid
up
with
an
attack
of
rheumatism
.
   
<EOS>
But
although
the
bodily
powers
of
the
great
man
were
thus
impaired
,
his
mental
energies
retained
their
pristine
vigour
.
 
<EOS>
His
spirits
were
elastic
;
his
good
-
humour
was
restored
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
vexation
consequent
upon
his
recent
adventure
had
vanished
from
his
mind
;
and
he
could
join
in
the
hearty
laughter
,
which
any
allusion
to
it
excited
in
Mr
Wardle
,
without
anger
and
without
embarrassment
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
more
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
two
days
Mr
Pickwick
was
confined
to
bed
,
Sam
was
his
constant
attendant
.
<EOS>
On
the
first
,
he
endeavoured
to
amuse
his
master
by
anecdote
and
conversation
;
on
the
second
,
Mr
Pickwick
demanded
his
writing
-
desk
,
and
pen
and
ink
,
and
was
deeply
engaged
during
the
whole
day
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
third
,
being
able
to
sit
up
in
his
bedchamber
,
he
despatched
his
valet
with
a
message
to
Mr
Wardle
and
Mr
Trundle
,
intimating
that
if
they
would
take
their
wine
there
,
that
evening
,
they
would
greatly
oblige
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
invitation
was
most
willingly
accepted
;
and
when
they
were
seated
over
their
wine
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
sundry
blushes
,
produced
the
following
little
tale
,
as
having
been
"

by
himself

during
his
recent

The

Clerk
  
<EOS>
A
Tale
of
True
Love
    
"
Once
upon
a
time
,
in
a
very
small
country
town
,
at
a
considerable
distance
from
London
,
there
lived
a
little
man
named
Nathaniel
Pipkin
,
who
was
the
parish
clerk
of
the
little
town
,
and
lived
in
a
little
house
in
the
little
High
Street
,
within
ten
minutes
"
walk
from
the
little
church
;
and
who
was
to
be
found
every
day
,
from
nine
till
four
,
teaching
a
little
learning
to
the
little
boys
.
 
<EOS>
Nathaniel
Pipkin
was
a
harmless
,
inoffensive
,
good
-
natured
being
,
with
a
turned
-
up
nose
,
and
rather
turned
-
in
legs
,
a
cast
in
his
eye
,
and
a
halt
in
his
gait
;
and
he
divided
his
time
between
the
church
and
his
school
,
verily
believing
that
there
existed
not
,
on
the
face
of
the
earth
,
so
clever
a
man
as
the
curate
,
<EOS>
so
imposing
an
apartment
as
the
vestry
-
room
,
or
so
well
-
ordered
a
seminary
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
Once
,
and
only
once
,
in
his
life
,
Nathaniel
Pipkin
had
seen
a
bishop
---
a
real
bishop
,
with
his
arms
in
lawn
sleeves
,
and
his
head
in
a
wig
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
seen
him
walk
,
and
heard
him
talk
,
at
a
confirmation
,
on
which
momentous
occasion
<EOS>
Nathaniel
Pipkin
was
so
overcome
with
reverence
and
awe
,
when
the
aforesaid
bishop
laid
his
hand
on
his
head
,
that
he
fainted
right
clean
away
,
and
was
borne
out
of
church
in
the
arms
of
the
beadle
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
was
a
great
event
,
a
tremendous
era
,
in
Nathaniel
Pipkin
's
life
,
and
it
was
the
only
one
that
had
ever
occurred
to
ruffle
the
smooth
current
of
his
quiet
existence
,
when
happening
one
fine
afternoon
,
in
a
fit
of
mental
abstraction
,
to
raise
his
eyes
from
the
slate
on
which
he
was
devising
some
tremendous
problem
in
compound
addition
for
an
offending
urchin
to
solve
,
they
suddenly
rested
on
the
blooming
countenance
of
Maria
Lobbs
,
the
only
daughter
of
old
Lobbs
,
the
great
saddler
over
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
the
eyes
of
Mr
Pipkin
had
rested
on
the
pretty
face
of
Maria
Lobbs
many
a
time
and
oft
before
,
at
church
and
elsewhere
;
but
the
eyes
of
Maria
Lobbs
had
never
looked
so
bright
,
the
cheeks
of
Maria
Lobbs
had
never
looked
so
ruddy
,
as
upon
this
particular
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
No
wonder
then
,
that
Nathaniel
Pipkin
was
unable
to
take
his
eyes
from
the
countenance
of
Miss
Lobbs
;
no
wonder
that
Miss
Lobbs
,
finding
herself
stared
at
by
a
young
man
,
withdrew
her
head
from
the
window
out
of
which
she
had
been
peeping
,
and
shut
the
casement
and
pulled
down
the
blind
;
no
wonder
that
Nathaniel
Pipkin
,
immediately
thereafter
,
fell
upon
the
young
urchin
who
had
previously
offended
,
and
cuffed
and
knocked
him
about
to
his
heart
's
content
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
was
very
natural
,
and
there
's
nothing
at
all
to
wonder
at
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
IS
matter
of
wonder
,
though
,
that
anyone
of
Mr
Nathaniel
Pipkin
's
retiring
disposition
,
nervous
temperament
,
and
most
particularly
diminutive
income
,
should
from
this
day
forth
,
have
dared
to
aspire
to
the
hand
and
heart
of
the
only
daughter
of
the
fiery
old
Lobbs
---
of
old
Lobbs
,
the
great
saddler
,
who
could
have
bought
up
the
whole
village
at
one
stroke
of
his
pen
,
and
never
felt
the
outlay
---
<EOS>
old
Lobbs
,
who
was
well
known
to
have
heaps
of
money
,
invested
in
the
bank
at
the
nearest
market
town
---
who
was
reported
to
have
countless
and
inexhaustible
treasures
hoarded
up
in
the
little
iron
safe
with
the
big
keyhole
,
over
the
chimney
-
piece
in
the
back
parlour
---
and
who
,
it
was
well
known
,
on
festive
occasions
garnished
his
board
with
a
real
silver
teapot
,
cream
-
ewer
,
and
sugar
-
basin
,
which
he
was
wo
nt
,
in
the
pride
of
his
heart
,
to
boast
should
be
his
daughter
's
property
when
she
found
a
man
to
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
it
,
to
be
matter
of
profound
astonishment
and
intense
wonder
,
that
Nathaniel
Pipkin
should
have
had
the
temerity
to
cast
his
eyes
in
this
direction
.
 
<EOS>
But
love
is
blind
;
and
Nathaniel
had
a
cast
in
his
eye
;
and
perhaps
these
two
circumstances
,
taken
together
,
prevented
his
seeing
the
matter
in
its
proper
light
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
if
old
Lobbs
had
entertained
the
most
remote
or
distant
idea
of
the
state
of
the
affections
of
Nathaniel
Pipkin
,
he
would
just
have
razed
the
school
-
room
to
the
ground
,
or
exterminated
its
master
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
,
or
committed
some
other
outrage
and
atrocity
of
an
equally
ferocious
and
violent
description
;
for
he
was
a
terrible
old
fellow
,
was
Lobbs
,
when
his
pride
was
injured
,
or
his
blood
was
up
.
 
<EOS>
Swear
!
 
<EOS>
Such
trains
of
oaths
would
come
rolling
and
pealing
over
the
way
,
sometimes
,
when
he
was
denouncing
the
idleness
of
the
bony
apprentice
with
the
thin
legs
,
that
Nathaniel
Pipkin
would
shake
in
his
shoes
with
horror
,
and
the
hair
of
the
pupils
"
heads
would
stand
on
end
with
fright
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
Day
after
day
,
when
school
was
over
,
and
the
pupils
gone
<EOS>
,
did
Nathaniel
Pipkin
sit
himself
down
at
the
front
window
,
and
,
while
he
feigned
to
be
reading
a
book
,
throw
sidelong
glances
over
the
way
in
search
of
the
bright
eyes
of
Maria
Lobbs
;
and
he
had
n't
sat
there
many
days
,
before
the
bright
eyes
appeared
at
an
upper
window
,
apparently
deeply
engaged
in
reading
too
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
delightful
,
and
gladdening
to
the
heart
of
Nathaniel
Pipkin
.
<EOS>
It
was
something
to
sit
there
for
hours
together
,
and
look
upon
that
pretty
face
when
the
eyes
were
cast
down
;
but
when
Maria
Lobbs
began
to
raise
her
eyes
from
her
book
,
and
dart
their
rays
in
the
direction
of
Nathaniel
Pipkin
,
his
delight
and
admiration
were
perfectly
boundless
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
one
day
when
he
knew
old
Lobbs
was
out
,
Nathaniel
Pipkin
had
the
temerity
to
kiss
his
hand
to
Maria
Lobbs
;
and
Maria
Lobbs
,
instead
of
shutting
the
window
,
and
pulling
down
the
blind
,
kissed
HERS
to
him
,
and
smiled
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
Nathaniel
Pipkin
determined
,
that
,
come
what
might
,
he
would
develop
the
state
of
his
feelings
,
without
further
delay
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
prettier
foot
,
a
gayer
heart
,
a
more
dimpled
face
,
or
a
smarter
form
,
never
bounded
so
lightly
over
the
earth
they
graced
,
as
did
those
of
Maria
Lobbs
,
the
old
saddler
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
roguish
twinkle
in
her
sparkling
eyes
,
that
would
have
made
its
way
to
far
less
susceptible
bosoms
than
that
of
Nathaniel
Pipkin
;
and
there
was
such
a
joyous
sound
in
her
merry
laugh
,
that
the
sternest
misanthrope
must
have
smiled
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
Even
old
Lobbs
himself
,
in
the
very
height
of
his
ferocity
,
could
n't
resist
the
coaxing
of
his
pretty
daughter
;
and
when
she
,
and
her
cousin
Kate
---
an
arch
,
impudent
-
looking
,
bewitching
little
person
---
made
a
dead
set
upon
the
old
man
together
,
as
,
to
say
the
truth
,
they
very
often
did
<EOS>
,
he
could
have
refused
them
nothing
,
even
had
they
asked
for
a
portion
of
the
countless
and
inexhaustible
treasures
,
which
were
hidden
from
the
light
,
in
the
iron
safe
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nathaniel
Pipkin
's
heart
beat
high
within
him
,
when
he
saw
this
enticing
little
couple
<EOS>
some
hundred
yards
before
him
one
summer
's
evening
,
in
the
very
field
in
which
he
had
many
a
time
strolled
about
till
night
-
time
,
and
pondered
on
the
beauty
of
Maria
Lobbs
.
 
<EOS>
But
though
he
had
often
thought
then
,
how
briskly
he
would
walk
up
to
Maria
Lobbs
and
tell
her
of
his
passion
if
he
could
only
meet
her
,
he
felt
,
now
that
she
was
unexpectedly
before
him
,
all
the
blood
in
his
body
mounting
to
his
face
,
manifestly
to
the
great
detriment
of
his
legs
,
which
,
deprived
of
their
usual
portion
,
trembled
beneath
him
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
stopped
to
gather
a
hedge
flower
,
or
listen
to
a
bird
,
Nathaniel
Pipkin
stopped
too
,
and
pretended
to
be
absorbed
in
meditation
,
as
indeed
he
really
was
;
for
he
was
thinking
what
on
earth
he
should
ever
do
,
when
they
turned
back
,
as
they
inevitably
must
in
time
,
and
meet
him
face
to
face
.
 
<EOS>
But
though
he
was
afraid
to
make
up
to
them
,
he
could
n't
bear
to
lose
sight
of
them
;
so
when
they
walked
faster
he
walked
faster
,
when
they
lingered
he
lingered
,
and
when
they
stopped
he
stopped
;
and
so
they
might
have
gone
on
,
until
the
darkness
prevented
them
,
if
Kate
had
not
looked
slyly
back
,
and
encouragingly
beckoned
Nathaniel
to
advance
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
Kate
's
manner
that
was
not
to
be
resisted
,
and
so
Nathaniel
Pipkin
complied
with
the
invitation
;
and
after
a
great
deal
of
blushing
on
his
part
,
and
immoderate
laughter
on
that
of
the
wicked
little
cousin
,
Nathaniel
Pipkin
went
down
on
his
knees
on
the
dewy
grass
,
and
declared
his
resolution
to
remain
there
for
ever
,
unless
he
were
permitted
to
rise
the
accepted
lover
of
Maria
Lobbs
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
merry
laughter
of
Miss
Lobbs
rang
through
the
calm
evening
air
---
without
seeming
to
disturb
it
,
though
;
it
had
such
a
pleasant
sound
---
and
the
wicked
little
cousin
laughed
more
immoderately
than
before
,
and
Nathaniel
Pipkin
blushed
deeper
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
Maria
Lobbs
being
more
strenuously
urged
by
the
love
-
worn
little
man
,
turned
away
her
head
,
and
whispered
her
cousin
to
say
,
or
at
all
events
Kate
did
say
,
that
she
felt
much
honoured
by
Mr
Pipkin
's
addresses
;
that
her
hand
and
heart
were
at
her
father
's
disposal
;
but
that
nobody
could
be
insensible
to
Mr
Pipkin
's
merits
.
 
<EOS>
As
all
this
was
said
with
much
gravity
,
and
as
Nathaniel
Pipkin
walked
home
with
Maria
Lobbs
,
and
struggled
for
a
kiss
at
parting
,
he
went
to
bed
a
happy
man
,
and
dreamed
all
night
long
,
of
softening
old
Lobbs
,
opening
the
strong
box
,
and
marrying
Maria
.
   
<EOS>
The
next
day
,
Nathaniel
Pipkin
saw
old
Lobbs
go
out
upon
his
old
gray
pony
,
and
after
a
great
many
signs
at
the
window
from
the
wicked
little
cousin
,
the
object
and
meaning
of
which
he
could
by
no
means
understand
,
the
bony
apprentice
with
the
thin
legs
came
over
to
say
that
his
master
was
n't
coming
home
all
night
,
and
that
the
ladies
expected
Mr
Pipkin
to
tea
,
at
six
o'clock
precisely
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
lessons
were
got
through
that
day
,
neither
Nathaniel
Pipkin
nor
his
pupils
knew
any
more
than
you
do
;
but
they
were
got
through
somehow
,
and
,
after
the
boys
had
gone
,
Nathaniel
Pipkin
took
till
full
six
o'clock
to
dress
himself
to
his
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
it
took
long
to
select
the
garments
he
should
wear
,
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
he
had
no
choice
about
the
matter
;
but
the
putting
of
them
on
to
the
best
advantage
,
and
the
touching
of
them
up
previously
,
was
a
task
of
no
inconsiderable
difficulty
or
importance
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
very
snug
little
party
,
consisting
of
Maria
Lobbs
and
her
cousin
Kate
,
and
three
or
four
romping
,
good
-
humoured
,
rosy
-
cheeked
girls
.
 
<EOS>
Nathaniel
Pipkin
had
ocular
demonstration
of
the
fact
,
that
the
rumours
of
old
Lobbs
's
treasures
were
not
exaggerated
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
the
real
solid
silver
teapot
,
cream
-
ewer
,
and
sugar
-
basin
,
on
the
table
,
and
real
silver
spoons
to
stir
the
tea
with
,
and
real
china
cups
to
drink
it
out
of
,
and
plates
of
the
same
,
to
hold
the
cakes
and
toast
in
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
eye
-
sore
in
the
whole
place
was
another
cousin
of
Maria
Lobbs
's
,
and
a
brother
of
Kate
,
whom
Maria
Lobbs
called
"
Henry
,
"
and
who
seemed
to
keep
Maria
Lobbs
all
to
himself
,
up
in
one
corner
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
delightful
thing
to
see
affection
in
families
,
but
it
may
be
carried
rather
too
far
,
and
Nathaniel
Pipkin
could
not
help
thinking
that
Maria
Lobbs
must
be
very
particularly
fond
of
her
relations
,
if
she
paid
as
much
attention
to
all
of
them
as
to
this
individual
cousin
.
 
<EOS>
After
tea
,
too
,
when
the
wicked
little
cousin
proposed
a
game
at
blind
man
's
buff
,
it
somehow
or
other
happened
that
Nathaniel
Pipkin
was
nearly
always
blind
,
and
whenever
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
male
cousin
,
he
was
sure
to
find
that
Maria
Lobbs
was
not
far
off
.
 
<EOS>
And
though
the
wicked
little
cousin
and
the
other
girls
pinched
him
,
and
pulled
his
hair
,
and
pushed
chairs
in
his
way
,
and
all
sorts
of
things
,
Maria
Lobbs
never
seemed
to
come
near
him
at
all
;
and
once
---
once
---
Nathaniel
Pipkin
could
have
sworn
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
kiss
,
followed
by
a
faint
remonstrance
from
Maria
Lobbs
,
and
a
half
-
suppressed
laugh
from
her
female
friends
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
was
odd
---
very
odd
---
and
there
is
no
saying
what
Nathaniel
Pipkin
might
or
might
not
have
done
,
in
consequence
,
if
his
thoughts
had
not
been
suddenly
directed
into
a
new
channel
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
circumstance
which
directed
his
thoughts
into
a
new
channel
was
a
loud
knocking
at
the
street
door
,
and
the
person
who
made
this
loud
knocking
at
the
street
door
was
no
other
than
old
Lobbs
himself
,
who
had
unexpectedly
returned
,
and
was
hammering
away
,
like
a
coffin
-
maker
;
for
he
wanted
his
supper
.
 
<EOS>
The
alarming
intelligence
was
no
sooner
communicated
by
the
bony
apprentice
with
the
thin
legs
,
than
the
girls
tripped
upstairs
to
Maria
Lobbs
's
bedroom
,
and
the
male
cousin
and
Nathaniel
Pipkin
were
thrust
into
a
couple
of
closets
in
the
sitting
-
room
,
for
want
of
any
better
places
of
concealment
;
and
when
Maria
Lobbs
and
the
wicked
little
cousin
had
stowed
them
away
,
and
put
the
room
to
rights
,
they
opened
the
street
door
to
old
Lobbs
,
who
had
never
left
off
knocking
since
he
first
began
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
it
did
unfortunately
happen
that
old
Lobbs
being
very
hungry
was
monstrous
cross
.
 
<EOS>
Nathaniel
Pipkin
could
hear
him
growling
away
like
an
old
mastiff
with
a
sore
throat
;
and
whenever
the
unfortunate
apprentice
with
the
thin
legs
came
into
the
room
,
so
surely
did
old
Lobbs
commence
swearing
at
him
in
a
most
Saracenic
and
ferocious
manner
,
though
apparently
with
no
other
end
or
object
than
that
of
easing
his
bosom
by
the
discharge
of
a
few
superfluous
oaths
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
some
supper
,
which
had
been
warming
up
,
was
placed
on
the
table
,
and
then
old
Lobbs
fell
to
,
in
regular
style
;
and
having
made
clear
work
of
it
in
no
time
,
kissed
his
daughter
,
and
demanded
his
pipe
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nature
had
placed
Nathaniel
Pipkin
's
knees
in
very
close
juxtaposition
,
but
when
he
heard
old
Lobbs
demand
his
pipe
,
they
knocked
together
,
as
if
they
were
going
to
reduce
each
other
to
powder
;
for
,
depending
from
a
couple
of
hooks
,
in
the
very
closet
in
which
he
stood
,
was
a
large
,
brown
-
stemmed
,
silver
-
bowled
pipe
,
which
pipe
he
himself
had
seen
in
the
mouth
of
old
Lobbs
,
regularly
every
afternoon
and
evening
,
for
the
last
five
years
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
girls
went
downstairs
for
the
pipe
,
and
upstairs
for
the
pipe
,
and
everywhere
but
where
they
knew
the
pipe
was
,
and
old
Lobbs
stormed
away
meanwhile
,
in
the
most
wonderful
manner
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
thought
of
the
closet
,
and
walked
up
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
of
no
use
a
little
man
like
Nathaniel
Pipkin
pulling
the
door
inwards
,
when
a
great
strong
fellow
like
old
Lobbs
was
pulling
it
outwards
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Lobbs
gave
it
one
tug
,
and
open
it
flew
,
disclosing
Nathaniel
Pipkin
standing
bolt
upright
inside
,
and
shaking
with
apprehension
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
us
!
<EOS>
what
an
appalling
look
<EOS>
old
Lobbs
gave
him
,
as
he
dragged
him
out
by
the
collar
,
and
held
him
at
arm
's
length
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Why
,
what
the
devil
do
you
want
here
?
"
said
old
Lobbs
,
in
a
fearful
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nathaniel
Pipkin
could
make
no
reply
,
so
old
Lobbs
shook
him
backwards
and
forwards
,
for
two
or
three
minutes
,
by
way
of
arranging
his
ideas
for
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
What
do
you
want
here
?
"
<EOS>
roared
Lobbs
<EOS>
;
"
I
suppose
you
have
come
after
my
daughter
,
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Old
Lobbs
merely
said
this
as
a
sneer
:
for
he
did
not
believe
that
mortal
presumption
could
have
carried
Nathaniel
Pipkin
so
far
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
his
indignation
,
when
that
poor
man
replied
---
"
"
Yes
,
I
did
,
Mr
Lobbs
,
I
did
come
after
your
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
her
,
Mr
Lobbs
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
"
Why
,
you
snivelling
,
wry
-
faced
,
puny
villain
,
"
gasped
old
Lobbs
,
paralysed
by
the
atrocious
confession
;
"
what
do
you
mean
by
that
?
 
Say
this
to
my
face
!
 
<EOS>
Damme
,
I
'll
throttle
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
by
no
means
improbable
that
old
Lobbs
would
have
carried
his
threat
into
execution
,
in
the
excess
of
his
rage
,
if
his
arm
had
not
been
stayed
by
a
very
unexpected
apparition
:
to
wit
,
the
male
cousin
,
who
,
stepping
out
of
his
closet
,
and
walking
up
to
old
Lobbs
,
said
---
   
"
"
I
can
not
allow
this
harmless
person
,
Sir
,
who
has
been
asked
here
,
in
some
girlish
frolic
,
to
take
upon
himself
,
in
a
very
noble
manner
,
the
fault
(
if
fault
it
is
)
which
I
am
guilty
of
,
and
am
ready
to
avow
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
your
daughter
,
sir
;
and
I
came
here
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
her
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Old
Lobbs
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
at
this
,
but
not
wider
than
Nathaniel
Pipkin
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
You
did
?
"
said
Lobbs
,
at
last
finding
breath
to
speak
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
And
I
forbade
you
this
house
,
long
ago
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
You
did
,
or
I
should
not
have
been
here
,
clandestinely
,
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
record
it
of
old
Lobbs
,
but
I
think
he
would
have
struck
the
cousin
,
if
his
pretty
daughter
,
with
her
bright
eyes
swimming
in
tears
,
had
not
clung
to
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Do
n't
stop
him
,
Maria
,
"
said
the
young
man
;
"
if
he
has
the
will
to
strike
me
,
let
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
hurt
a
hair
of
his
gray
head
,
for
the
riches
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
old
man
cast
down
his
eyes
at
this
reproof
,
and
they
met
those
of
his
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hinted
once
or
twice
before
,
that
they
were
very
bright
eyes
,
and
,
though
they
were
tearful
now
,
their
influence
was
by
no
means
lessened
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Lobbs
turned
his
head
away
,
as
if
to
avoid
being
persuaded
by
them
,
when
,
as
fortune
would
have
it
,
he
encountered
the
face
of
the
wicked
little
cousin
,
who
,
half
afraid
for
her
brother
,
and
half
laughing
at
Nathaniel
Pipkin
,
presented
as
bewitching
an
expression
of
countenance
,
with
a
touch
of
slyness
in
it
,
too
,
as
any
man
,
old
or
young
,
need
look
upon
.
 
<EOS>
She
drew
her
arm
coaxingly
through
the
old
man
's
,
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
;
and
do
what
he
would
,
old
Lobbs
could
n't
help
breaking
out
into
a
smile
,
while
a
tear
stole
down
his
cheek
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Five
minutes
after
this
,
the
girls
were
brought
down
from
the
bedroom
with
a
great
deal
of
giggling
and
modesty
;
and
while
the
young
people
were
making
themselves
perfectly
happy
,
old
Lobbs
got
down
the
pipe
,
and
smoked
it
;
and
it
was
a
remarkable
circumstance
about
that
particular
pipe
of
tobacco
,
that
it
was
the
most
soothing
and
delightful
one
he
ever
smoked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nathaniel
Pipkin
thought
it
best
to
keep
his
own
counsel
,
and
by
so
doing
gradually
rose
into
high
favour
with
old
Lobbs
.
 
<EOS>
who
taught
him
to
smoke
in
time
;
and
they
used
to
sit
out
in
the
garden
on
the
fine
evenings
,
for
many
years
afterwards
,
smoking
and
drinking
in
great
state
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
recovered
the
effects
of
his
attachment
,
for
we
find
his
name
in
the
parish
register
,
as
a
witness
to
the
marriage
of
Maria
Lobbs
to
her
cousin
;
and
it
also
appears
,
by
reference
to
other
documents
,
that
on
the
night
of
the
wedding
he
was
incarcerated
in
the
village
cage
,
for
having
,
in
a
state
of
extreme
intoxication
,
committed
sundry
excesses
in
the
streets
,
in
all
of
which
he
was
aided
and
abetted
by
the
bony
apprentice
with
the
thin
legs
.

<EOS>
Briefly
illustrative
of
two
points
;
first
,
the
power
of
hysterics
,
and
,
secondly
,
the
force
of
circumstances
 
For
two
days
after
the
DEJEUNE
at
Mrs
Hunter
's
,
the
Pickwickians
remained
at
Eatanswill
,
anxiously
awaiting
the
arrival
of
some
intelligence
from
their
revered
leader
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
and
Mr
Snodgrass
were
once
again
left
to
their
own
means
of
amusement
;
for
Mr
Winkle
,
in
compliance
with
a
most
pressing
invitation
,
continued
to
reside
at
Mr
Pott
's
house
,
and
to
devote
his
time
to
the
companionship
of
his
amiable
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
the
occasional
society
of
Mr
Pott
himself
wanting
to
complete
their
felicity
.
<EOS>
Deeply
immersed
in
the
intensity
of
his
speculations
for
the
public
weal
and
the
destruction
of
the
INDEPENDENT
,
it
was
not
the
habit
of
that
great
man
to
descend
from
his
mental
pinnacle
to
the
humble
level
of
ordinary
minds
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
,
however
,
and
as
if
expressly
in
compliment
to
any
follower
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
,
he
unbent
,
relaxed
,
stepped
down
from
his
pedestal
,
and
walked
upon
the
ground
,
benignly
adapting
his
remarks
to
the
comprehension
of
the
herd
,
and
seeming
in
outward
form
,
if
not
in
spirit
,
to
be
one
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
Such
having
been
the
demeanour
of
this
celebrated
public
character
towards
Mr
Winkle
,
it
will
be
readily
imagined
that
considerable
surprise
was
depicted
on
the
countenance
of
the
latter
gentleman
,
when
,
as
he
was
sitting
alone
in
the
breakfast
-
room
,
the
door
was
hastily
thrown
open
,
and
as
hastily
closed
,
on
the
entrance
of
Mr
Pott
,
who
,
stalking
majestically
towards
him
,
and
thrusting
aside
his
proffered
hand
,
ground
his
teeth
,
as
if
to
put
a
sharper
edge
on
what
he
was
about
to
utter
,
and
exclaimed
,
in
a
saw
-
like
voice
---
   
"
Serpent
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Winkle
,
starting
from
his
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
Serpent
,
Sir
,
"
repeated
Mr
Pott
,
raising
his
voice
,
and
then
suddenly
depressing
it
:
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
serpent

sir

make
the
most

<EOS>
When
you
have
parted
with
a
man
at
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
on
terms
of
the
utmost
good
-
fellowship
,
and
he
meets
you
again
,
at
half
-
past
nine
,
and
greets
you
as
a
serpent
,
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
conclude
that
something
of
an
unpleasant
nature
has
occurred
meanwhile
.
 
<EOS>
So
Mr
Winkle
thought
.
 
<EOS>
He
returned
Mr
Pott
's
gaze
of
stone
,
and
in
compliance
with
that
gentleman
's
request
,
proceeded
to
make
the
most
he
could
of
the
"
serpent
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
most
,
however
,
was
nothing
at
all
;
so
,
after
a
profound
silence
of
some
minutes
"
duration
,
he
said
,
---
   
"
Serpent
,
Sir
!
 
Serpent
,
Mr
Pott
!
 
<EOS>
What
can
you
mean
,
Sir
?
---
this
is
pleasantry
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pleasantry
,
sir
!
"
exclaimed
Pott
,
with
a
motion
of
the
hand
,
indicative
of
a
strong
desire
to
hurl
the
Britannia
metal
teapot
at
the
head
of
the
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pleasantry
,
sir
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
But
---
no
,
I
will
be
calm
;
I
will
be
calm
,
Sir
;
"
in
proof
of
his
calmness
,
Mr
Pott
flung
himself
into
a
chair
,
and
foamed
at
the
mouth
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
,
"
interposed
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
DEAR
Sir
!
"
replied
Pott
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
address
me
,
as
dear
Sir
,
Sir
?
 
<EOS>
How
dare
you
look
me
in
the
face
and
do
it
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
if
you
come
to
that
,
"
responded
Mr
Winkle
,
"
<EOS>
how
dare
you
look
me
in
the
face
,
and
call
me
a
serpent
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
you
are
one
,
"
replied
Mr
Pott
.
   
<EOS>
"
Prove
it
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
warmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Prove
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
malignant
scowl
passed
over
the
profound
face
of
the
editor
,
as
he
drew
from
his
pocket
the
INDEPENDENT
of
that
morning
;
and
laying
his
finger
on
a
particular
paragraph
,
threw
the
journal
across
the
table
to
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
That
gentleman
took
it
up
,
and
read
as
follows
:
---
   
<EOS>
"
Our
obscure
and
filthy
contemporary
,
in
some
disgusting
observations
on
the
recent
election
for
this
borough
,
has
presumed
to
violate
the
hallowed
sanctity
of
private
life
,
and
to
refer
,
   
in
a
manner
not
to
be
misunderstood
,
to
the
personal
affairs
of
our
late
candidate
---
aye
,
and
notwithstanding
his
base
defeat
,
we
will
add
,
our
future
member
,
Mr
Fizkin
.
 
<EOS>
What
does
our
dastardly
contemporary
mean
?
 
<EOS>
What
would
the
ruffian
say
,
if
we
,
setting
at
naught
,
like
him
,
the
decencies
of
social
intercourse
,
were
to
raise
the
curtain
which
happily
conceals
His
private
life
from
general
ridicule
,
not
to
say
from
general
execration
?
 
<EOS>
What
,
if
we
were
even
to
point
out
,
and
comment
on
,
facts
and
circumstances
,
which
are
publicly
notorious
,
and
beheld
by
every
one
but
our
mole
-
eyed
contemporary
---
<EOS>
what
if
we
were
to
print
the
following
effusion
,
which
we
received
while
we
were
writing
the
commencement
of
this
article
,
from
a
talented
fellow
-
townsman
and
correspondent
?

LINES
TO
A
BRASS
POT
   
"
<EOS>
"
Oh
Pott
!
<EOS>
if
you
'd
known
How
false
she
'd
have
grown
,
When
you
heard
the
marriage
bells
tinkle
;
You
'd
have
done
then
<EOS>
,
I
vow
,
<EOS>
What
you
can
not
help
now
,
And
handed
her
over
to
W

"
"
   
"
What
,
"
said
Mr
Pott
solemnly
---
"
what
rhymes
to
"
tinkle
,
"
villain
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
rhymes
to
tinkle
?
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs
Pott
,
whose
entrance
at
the
moment
forestalled
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
rhymes
to
tinkle
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Winkle
,
I
should
conceive
.
"
 
<EOS>
Saying
this
,
Mrs
Pott
smiled
sweetly
on
the
disturbed
Pickwickian
,
and
extended
her
hand
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
agitated
young
man
would
have
accepted
it
,
in
his
confusion
,
had
not
Pott
indignantly
interposed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Back
,
ma'am
---
back
!
"
said
the
editor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
his
hand
before
my
very
face
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
P
!
"
said
his
astonished
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wretched
woman
,
look
here
,
"
exclaimed
the
husband
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
ma'am
---

Lines
to
a
Brass
Pot

<EOS>
"
Brass
Pot

<EOS>
;
that
's
me
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
"
False
SHE'D
have
grown
"
;
that
's
you
,
ma'am
---
you
.
"
<EOS>
With
this
ebullition
of
rage
,
which
was
not
unaccompanied
with
something
like
a
tremble
,
at
the
expression
of
his
wife
's
face
,
Mr
Pott
dashed
the
current
number
of
the
Eatanswill
INDEPENDENT
at
her
feet
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
astonished
Mrs
Pott
,
stooping
to
pick
up
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
Sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pott
winced
beneath
the
contemptuous
gaze
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
a
desperate
struggle
to
screw
up
his
courage
,
but
it
was
fast
coming
unscrewed
again
.
   
<EOS>
There
appears
nothing
very
tremendous
in
this
little
sentence
,
"
Upon
my
word
,
sir
,
"
when
it
comes
to
be
read
;
but
the
tone
of
voice
in
which
it
was
delivered
,
and
the
look
that
accompanied
it
,
both
seeming
to
bear
reference
to
some
revenge
to
be
thereafter
visited
upon
the
head
of
Pott
,
produced
their
effect
upon
him
.
<EOS>
The
most
unskilful
observer
could
have
detected
in
his
troubled
countenance
,
a
readiness
to
resign
his
Wellington
boots
to
any
efficient
substitute
who
would
have
consented
to
stand
in
them
at
that
moment
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Pott
read
the
paragraph
,
uttered
a
loud
shriek
,
and
threw
herself
at
full
length
on
the
hearth
-
rug
,
screaming
,
and
tapping
it
with
the
heels
of
her
shoes
,
in
a
manner
which
could
leave
no
doubt
of
the
propriety
of
her
feelings
on
the
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
the
terrified
Pott
,
"
I
did
n't
say
I
believed
it
;
---
I
---
"
but
the
unfortunate
man
's
voice
was
drowned
in
the
screaming
of
his
partner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Pott
,
let
me
entreat
you
,
my
dear
ma'am
,
to
compose
yourself
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
;
but
the
shrieks
and
tappings
were
louder
,
and
more
frequent
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Pott
,
"
I
'm
very
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
wo
n't
consider
your
own
health
,
consider
me
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
have
a
crowd
round
the
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
the
more
strenuously
Mr
Pott
entreated
,
the
more
vehemently
the
screams
poured
forth
.
   
<EOS>
Very
fortunately
,
however
,
attached
to
Mrs
Pott
's
person
was
a
bodyguard
of
one
,
a
young
lady
whose
ostensible
employment
was
to
preside
over
her
toilet
,
but
who
rendered
herself
useful
in
a
variety
of
ways
,
and
in
none
more
so
than
in
the
particular
department
of
constantly
aiding
and
abetting
her
mistress
in
every
wish
and
inclination
opposed
to
the
desires
of
the
unhappy
Pott
.
 
<EOS>
The
screams
reached
this
young
lady
's
ears
in
due
course
,
and
brought
her
into
the
room
with
a
speed
which
threatened
to
derange
,
materially
,
the
very
exquisite
arrangement
of
her
cap
and
ringlets
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
,
dear
mistress
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
bodyguard
,
kneeling
frantically
by
the
side
of
the
prostrate
Mrs
Pott
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
mistress
,
what
is
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
master
---
your
brutal
master
,
"
murmured
the
patient
.
   
<EOS>
Pott
was
evidently
giving
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
shame
,
"
said
the
bodyguard
reproachfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
'll
be
the
death
on
you
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
dear
thing
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
gave
way
more
.
 
<EOS>
The
opposite
party
followed
up
the
attack
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
leave
me
---
do
n't
leave
me
,
Goodwin
,
"
murmured
Mrs
Pott
,
clutching
at
the
wrist
of
the
said
Goodwin
with
an
hysteric
jerk
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
the
only
person
that
's
kind
to
me
,
Goodwin
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
affecting
appeal
,
Goodwin
got
up
a
little
domestic
tragedy
of
her
own
,
and
shed
tears
copiously
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Never
,
ma'am
---
never
,
"
said
Goodwin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir
,
you
should
be
careful
---
<EOS>
you
should
indeed
;
you
do
n't
know
what
harm
you
may
do
missis
;
you
'll
be
sorry
for
it
one
day
,
I
know
<EOS>
---
I
've
always
said
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
unlucky
Pott
looked
timidly
on
,
but
said
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Goodwin
,
"
said
Mrs
Pott
,
in
a
soft
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ma'am
,
"
said
Goodwin
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
only
knew
how
I
have
loved
that
man
---
"
"
Do
n't
distress
yourself
by
recollecting
it
,
ma'am
,
"
said
the
bodyguard
.
   
<EOS>
Pott
looked
very
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
time
to
finish
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
sobbed
Mrs
Pott
,
"
now
,
after
all
,
to
be
treated
in
this
way
;
to
be
reproached
and
insulted
in
the
presence
of
a
third
party
,
and
that
party
almost
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
submit
to
it
!
 
<EOS>
Goodwin
,
"
continued
Mrs
Pott
,
raising
herself
in
the
arms
of
her
attendant
,
"
my
brother
,
the
lieutenant
,
shall
interfere
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
be
separated
,
Goodwin
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
certainly
serve
him
right
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Goodwin
.
   
<EOS>
Whatever
thoughts
the
threat
of
a
separation
might
have
awakened
in
Mr
Pott
's
mind
,
he
forbore
to
give
utterance
to
them
,
and
contented
himself
by
saying
,
with
great
humility
:
---
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
will
you
hear
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
A
fresh
train
of
sobs
was
the
only
reply
,
as
Mrs
Pott
grew
more
hysterical
,
requested
to
be
informed
why
she
was
ever
born
,
and
required
sundry
other
pieces
of
information
of
a
similar
description
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
remonstrated
Mr
Pott
,
"
do
not
give
way
to
these
sensitive
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
believed
that
the
paragraph
had
any
foundation
,
my
dear
---
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
only
angry
,
my
dear
---
I
may
say
outrageous
---
with
the
INDEPENDENT
people
for
daring
to
insert
it
;
that
's
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pott
cast
an
imploring
look
at
the
innocent
cause
of
the
mischief
,
as
if
to
entreat
him
to
say
nothing
about
the
serpent
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
steps
,
sir
,
do
you
mean
to
take
to
obtain
redress
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Winkle
,
gaining
courage
as
he
saw
Pott
losing
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Goodwin
<EOS>
,
"
observed
Mrs
Pott
,
"
does
he
mean
to
horsewhip
the
editor
of
the
INDEPENDENT
---
<EOS>
does
he
,
Goodwin
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
hush
,
ma'am
;
pray
keep
yourself
quiet
,
"
replied
the
bodyguard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
he
will
,
if
you
wish
it
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Pott
,
as
his
wife
evinced
decided
symptoms
of
going
off
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
shall
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
,
Goodwin
---
when
?
"
said
Mrs
Pott
,
still
undecided
about
the
going
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
Immediately
,
of
course
,
"
said
Mr
Pott
;
"
before
the
day
is
out
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Goodwin
,
"
resumed
Mrs
Pott
,
"
it
's
the
only
way
of
meeting
the
slander
,
and
setting
me
right
with
the
world
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
Goodwin
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
man
as
is
a
man
,
ma'am
,
could
refuse
to
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
,
as
the
hysterics
were
still
hovering
about
,
Mr
Pott
said
once
more
that
he
would
do
it
;
but
Mrs
Pott
was
so
overcome
at
the
bare
idea
of
having
ever
been
suspected
,
that
she
was
half
a
dozen
times
on
the
very
verge
of
a
relapse
,
and
most
unquestionably
would
have
gone
off
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
indefatigable
efforts
of
the
assiduous
Goodwin
,
and
repeated
entreaties
for
pardon
from
the
conquered
Pott
;
and
finally
,
when
that
unhappy
individual
had
been
frightened
and
snubbed
down
to
his
proper
level
,
Mrs
Pott
recovered
,
and
they
went
to
breakfast
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
allow
this
base
newspaper
slander
to
shorten
your
stay
here
,
Mr
Winkle
?
"
said
Mrs
Pott
,
smiling
through
the
traces
of
her
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
said
Mr
Pott
,
actuated
,
as
he
spoke
,
by
a
wish
that
his
visitor
would
choke
himself
with
the
morsel
of
dry
toast
which
he
was
raising
to
his
lips
at
the
moment
,
and
so
terminate
his
stay
effectually
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
;
"
but
a
letter
has
been
received
from
Mr
Pickwick
---
so
I
learn
by
a
note
from
Mr
Tupman
,
which
was
brought
up
to
my
bedroom
door
,
this
morning
---
in
which
he
requests
us
to
join
him
at
Bury
to
-
day
;
and
we
are
to
leave
by
the
coach
at
noon
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
come
back
?
"
said
Mrs
Pott
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
sure
?
"
said
Mrs
Pott
,
stealing
a
tender
look
at
her
visitor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
,
"
responded
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
The
breakfast
passed
off
in
silence
,
for
each
of
the
party
was
brooding
over
his
,
or
her
,
own
personal
grievances
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Pott
was
regretting
the
loss
of
a
beau
;
Mr
Pott
his
rash
pledge
to
horsewhip
the
INDEPENDENT
;
Mr
Winkle
his
having
innocently
placed
himself
in
so
awkward
a
situation
.
 
<EOS>
Noon
approached
,
and
after
many
adieux
and
promises
to
return
,
he
tore
himself
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
he
ever
comes
back
,
I
'll
poison
him
,
"
thought
Mr
Pott
,
as
he
turned
into
the
little
back
office
where
he
prepared
his
thunderbolts
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
ever
do
come
back
,
and
mix
myself
up
with
these
people
again
,
"
thought
Mr
Winkle
,
as
he
wended
his
way
to
the
Peacock
,
"
I
shall
deserve
to
be
horsewhipped
myself
---
that
's
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
friends
were
ready
,
the
coach
was
nearly
so
,
and
in
half
an
hour
they
were
proceeding
on
their
journey
,
along
the
road
over
which
Mr
Pickwick
and
Sam
had
so
recently
travelled
,
and
of
which
,
as
we
have
already
said
something
,
we
do
not
feel
called
upon
to
extract
Mr
Snodgrass
's
poetical
and
beautiful
description
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
Angel
,
ready
to
receive
them
,
and
by
that
gentleman
they
were
ushered
to
the
apartment
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
where
,
to
the
no
small
surprise
of
Mr
Winkle
and
Mr
Snodgrass
,
and
the
no
small
embarrassment
of
Mr
Tupman
,
they
found
old
Wardle
and
Trundle
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
?
"
said
the
old
man
,
grasping
Mr
Tupman
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
hang
back
,
or
look
sentimental
about
it
;
it
ca
n't
be
helped
,
old
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
For
her
sake
,
I
wish
you
'd
had
her
;
for
your
own
,
I
'm
very
glad
you
have
not
.
 
<EOS>
A
young
fellow
like
you
will
do
better
one
of
these
days
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
With
this
conclusion
,
Wardle
slapped
Mr
Tupman
on
the
back
,
and
laughed
heartily
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
how
are
you
,
my
fine
fellows
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
shaking
hands
with
Mr
Winkle
and
Mr
Snodgrass
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
been
telling
Pickwick
that
we
must
have
you
all
down
at
Christmas
.
 
<EOS>
We
're
going
to
have
a
wedding
---
<EOS>
a
real
wedding
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
wedding
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mr
Snodgrass
,
turning
very
pale
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
a
wedding
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
be
frightened
,
"
said
the
good
-
humoured
old
man
;
"
it
's
only
Trundle
there
,
and
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
is
that
all
?
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
,
relieved
from
a
painful
doubt
which
had
fallen
heavily
on
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
you
joy
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
How
is
Joe
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
replied
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sleepy
as
ever
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
your
mother
,
and
the
clergyman
,
and
all
of
'
em
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
well
.
"
   
"
Where
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
with
an
effort
---
<EOS>
"
where
is
---
SHE
,
Sir
?
"
<EOS>
and
he
turned
away
his
head
,
and
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
SHE
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
with
a
knowing
shake
of
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
my
single
relative
---
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
,
by
a
nod
,
intimated
that
his
question
applied
to
the
disappointed
Rachael
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
she
's
gone
away
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
living
at
a
relation
's
,
far
enough
off
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
n't
bear
to
see
the
girls
,
so
I
let
her
go
.
 
<EOS>
But
come
!
 
<EOS>
Here
's
the
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
be
hungry
after
your
ride
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
,
without
any
ride
at
all
;
so
let
us
fall
to
.
"
   
<EOS>
Ample
justice
was
done
to
the
meal
;
and
when
they
were
seated
round
the
table
,
after
it
had
been
disposed
of
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
to
the
intense
horror
and
indignation
of
his
followers
,
related
the
adventure
he
had
undergone
,
and
the
success
which
had
attended
the
base
artifices
of
the
diabolical
Jingle
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
attack
of
rheumatism
which
I
caught
in
that
garden
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
in
conclusion
,
"
renders
me
lame
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
,
too
,
have
had
something
of
an
adventure
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
with
a
smile
;
and
,
at
the
request
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
he
detailed
the
malicious
libel
of
the
Eatanswill
INDEPENDENT
,
and
the
consequent
excitement
of
their
friend
,
the
editor
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
brow
darkened
during
the
recital
.
 
<EOS>
His
friends
observed
it
,
and
,
when
Mr
Winkle
had
concluded
,
maintained
a
profound
silence
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
struck
the
table
emphatically
with
his
clenched
fist
,
and
spoke
as
follows
:
---
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
a
wonderful
circumstance
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
that
we
seem
destined
to
enter
no
man
's
house
without
involving
him
in
some
degree
of
trouble
?
 
<EOS>
Does
it
not
,
I
ask
,
bespeak
the
indiscretion
,
or
,
worse
than
that
,
the
blackness
of
heart
---
that
I
should
say
so
!
<EOS>
---
of
my
followers
,
that
,
beneath
whatever
roof
they
locate
,
they
disturb
the
peace
of
mind
and
happiness
of
some
confiding
female
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
,
I
say
---
"
   
Mr
Pickwick
would
in
all
probability
have
gone
on
for
some
time
,
had
not
the
entrance
of
Sam
,
with
a
letter
,
caused
him
to
break
off
in
his
eloquent
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
He
passed
his
handkerchief
across
his
forehead
,
took
off
his
spectacles
,
wiped
them
,
and
put
them
on
again
;
and
his
voice
had
recovered
its
wonted
softness
of
tone
when
he
said
---
   
"
What
have
you
there
,
Sam
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Called
at
the
post
-
office
just
now
,
and
found
this
here
letter
,
as
has
laid
there
for
two
days
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
sealed
vith
a
vafer
,
and
directed
in
round
hand
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
this
hand
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
opening
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mercy
on
us
!
<EOS>
what
's
this
?
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
a
jest
;
it
---
it
---
ca
n't
be
true
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
was
the
general
inquiry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nobody
dead
,
is
there
?
"
said
Wardle
,
alarmed
at
the
horror
in
Mr
Pickwick
's
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
made
no
reply
,
but
,
pushing
the
letter
across
the
table
,
and
desiring
Mr
Tupman
to
read
it
aloud
,
fell
back
in
his
chair
with
a
look
of
vacant
astonishment
quite
alarming
to
behold
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
,
with
a
trembling
voice
,
read
the
letter
,
of
which
the
following
is
a
copy
:
---
   
Freeman
's
Court
,
Cornhill
,
August
28th
,
1827
.
   
<EOS>
Bardell
against
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
,
   
Having
been
instructed
by
Mrs
Martha
Bardell
to
commence
an
action
against
you
for
a
breach
of
promise
of
marriage
,
for
which
the
plaintiff
lays
her
damages
at
fifteen
hundred
pounds
,
we
beg
to
inform
you
that
a
writ
has
been
issued
against
you
in
this
suit
in
the
Court
of
Common
Pleas
;
and
request
to
know
,
by
return
of
post
,
the
name
of
your
attorney
in
London
,
who
will
accept
service
thereof
.
   
<EOS>
We
are
,
Sir
,
Your
obedient
servants
,
Dodson
&
Fogg
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Samuel
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
impressive
in
the
mute
astonishment
with
which
each
man
regarded
his
neighbour
,
and
every
man
regarded
Mr
Pickwick
,
that
all
seemed
afraid
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
The
silence
was
at
length
broken
by
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dodson
and
Fogg
,
"
he
repeated
mechanically
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bardell
and
Pickwick
,
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
,
musing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Peace
of
mind
and
happiness
of
confiding
females
,
"
murmured
Mr
Winkle
,
with
an
air
of
abstraction
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
conspiracy
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
at
length
recovering
the
power
of
speech
;
"
a
base
conspiracy
between
these
two
grasping
attorneys
,
Dodson
and
Fogg
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Bardell
would
never
do
it
;
---
she
has
n't
the
heart
to
do
it
;
---
she
has
n't
the
case
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
Ridiculous
---
ridiculous
.
"
<EOS>
"
Of
her
heart
,
"
said
Wardle
,
with
a
smile
,
"
you
should
certainly
be
the
best
judge
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wish
to
discourage
you
,
but
I
should
certainly
say
that
,
of
her
case
,
Dodson
and
Fogg
are
far
better
judges
than
any
of
us
can
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
vile
attempt
to
extort
money
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
is
,
"
said
Wardle
,
with
a
short
,
dry
cough
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
ever
heard
me
address
her
in
any
way
but
that
in
which
a
lodger
would
address
his
landlady
?
"
<EOS>
continued
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
great
vehemence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
ever
saw
me
with
her
?
 
<EOS>
Not
even
my
friends
here
---
"
   
"
Except
on
one
occasion
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
changed
colour
.
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Mr
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
that
's
important
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
suspicious
then
,
I
suppose
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
glanced
timidly
at
his
leader
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
said
he
,
"
there
was
nothing
suspicious
;
but
---
I
do
n't
know
how
it
happened
,
mind
---
she
certainly
was
reclining
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Gracious
powers
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
the
recollection
of
the
scene
in
question
struck
forcibly
upon
him
;
"
what
a
dreadful
instance
of
the
force
of
circumstances
!
 
<EOS>
So
she
was
---
so
she
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
our
friend
was
soothing
her
anguish
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
rather
maliciously
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
was
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
deny
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
!
<EOS>
"
said
Wardle
;
"
for
a
case
in
which
there
's
nothing
suspicious
,
this
looks
rather
queer
---
eh
,
Pickwick
?
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
sly
dog
---
sly
dog
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
laughed
till
the
glasses
on
the
sideboard
rang
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
dreadful
conjunction
of
appearances
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
,
resting
his
chin
upon
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
Winkle
---
Tupman
<EOS>
---
I
beg
your
pardon
for
the
observations
I
made
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
all
the
victims
of
circumstances
,
and
I
the
greatest
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
apology
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
,
and
ruminated
;
while
Wardle
measured
out
a
regular
circle
of
nods
and
winks
,
addressed
to
the
other
members
of
the
company
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
have
it
explained
,
though
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
raising
his
head
and
hammering
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
see
this
Dodson
and
Fogg

<EOS>
I
'll
go
to
London
to

morrow

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
to

said
Wardle
;
"
you
're
too
lame

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Well

then

next

<EOS>
"
   
"
Next

<EOS>
"
Well

Mr

;

replied
Mr

<EOS>
"
Wery
<EOS>
well

<EOS>
Mr
Weller
left
the
room
,
and
departed
slowly
on
his
errand
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pocket
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground

<EOS>
"
Rum

said
Mr

,
as

walked
slowly
up

Moralising
in

Mr

bent
his
steps
towards

The

of
the
preparations
which
had
been
making
to
astonish
them
,
on
the
first
of
September
,
hailed
it
,
no
doubt
,
as
one
of
the
pleasantest
mornings
they
had
seen
that
season
.
 
<EOS>
Many
a
young
partridge
who
strutted
complacently
among
the
stubble
,
with
all
the
finicking
coxcombry
of
youth
,
and
many
an
older
one
who
watched
his
levity
out
of
his
little
round
eye
,
with
the
contemptuous
air
of
a
bird
of
wisdom
and
experience
<EOS>
,
alike
unconscious
of
their
approaching
doom
,
basked
in
the
fresh
morning
air
with
lively
and
blithesome
feelings
,
and
a
few
hours
afterwards
were
laid
low
upon
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
grow
affecting
:
let
us
proceed
.
   
<EOS>
In
plain
commonplace
matter
-
of
-
fact
,
then
,
it
was
a
fine
morning
---
<EOS>
so
fine
that
you
would
scarcely
have
believed
that
the
few
months
of
an
English
summer
had
yet
flown
by
.
 
<EOS>
Hedges
,
fields
,
and
trees
,
hill
and
moorland
,
presented
to
the
eye
their
ever
-
varying
shades
of
deep
rich
green
;
scarce
a
leaf
had
fallen
,
scarce
a
sprinkle
of
yellow
mingled
with
the
hues
of
summer
,
warned
you
that
autumn
had
begun
.
 
<EOS>
The
sky
was
cloudless
;
the
sun
shone
out
bright
and
warm
;
the
songs
of
birds
,
the
hum
of
myriads
of
summer
insects
,
filled
the
air
;
and
the
cottage
gardens
,
crowded
with
flowers
of
every
rich
and
beautiful
tint
,
sparkled
,
in
the
heavy
dew
,
like
beds
of
glittering
jewels
.
<EOS>
Everything
bore
the
stamp
of
summer
,
and
none
of
its
beautiful
colour
had
yet
faded
from
the
die
.
   
<EOS>
Such
was
the
morning
,
when
an
open
carriage
,
in
which
were
three
Pickwickians
(
Mr
Snodgrass
having
preferred
to
remain
at
home
)
,
Mr
Wardle
,
and
Mr
Trundle
,
with
Sam
Weller
on
the
box
beside
the
driver
,
pulled
up
by
a
gate
at
the
roadside
,
before
which
stood
a
tall
,
raw
-
boned
gamekeeper
,
and
a
half
-
booted
,
leather
-
legginged
boy
,
<EOS>
each
bearing
a
bag
of
capacious
dimensions
,
and
accompanied
by
a
brace
of
pointers
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
whispered
Mr
Winkle
to
Wardle
,
as
the
man
let
down
the
steps
,
"
they
do
n't
suppose
we
're
going
to
kill
game
enough
to
fill
those
bags
,
do
they
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fill
them
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
old
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
,
yes
!
 
<EOS>
You
shall
fill
one
,
and
I
the
other
;
and
when
we
've
done
with
them
,
the
pockets
of
our
shooting
-
jackets
will
hold
as
much
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
dismounted
without
saying
anything
in
reply
to
this
observation
;
but
he
thought
within
himself
,
that
if
the
party
remained
in
the
open
air
,
till
he
had
filled
one
of
the
bags
,
they
stood
a
considerable
chance
of
catching
colds
in
their
heads
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hi
,
Juno
,
lass
-
hi
,
old
girl
;
down
,
Daph
,
down
,
"
said
Wardle
,
caressing
the
dogs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Geoffrey
still
in
Scotland
,
of
course
,
Martin
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
tall
gamekeeper
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
and
looked
with
some
surprise
from
Mr
Winkle
,
who
was
holding
his
gun
as
if
he
wished
his
coat
pocket
to
save
him
the
trouble
of
pulling
the
trigger
,
to
Mr
Tupman
,
who
was
holding
his
as
if
he
was
afraid
of
it
---
as
there
is
no
earthly
reason
to
doubt
he
really
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
friends
are
not
much
in
the
way
of
this
sort
of
thing
yet
,
Martin
,
"
said
Wardle
,
noticing
the
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
Live
and
learn
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
They
'll
be
good
shots
one
of
these
days
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
my
friend
Winkle
's
pardon
,
though
;
he
has
had
some
practice
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
smiled
feebly
over
his
blue
neckerchief
in
acknowledgment
of
the
compliment
,
and
got
himself
so
mysteriously
entangled
with
his
gun
,
in
his
modest
confusion
,
that
if
the
piece
had
been
loaded
,
he
must
inevitably
have
shot
himself
dead
upon
the
spot
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
n't
handle
your
piece
in
that
'
ere
way
,
when
you
come
to
have
the
charge
in
it
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
tall
gamekeeper
gruffly
;
"
or
I
'm
damned
if
you
wo
n't
make
cold
meat
of
some
   
on
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
,
thus
admonished
,
abruptly
altered
his
position
,
and
in
so
doing
,
contrived
to
bring
the
barrel
into
pretty
smart
contact
with
Mr
Weller
's
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
!
<EOS>
"
said
Sam
,
picking
up
his
hat
,
which
had
been
knocked
off
,
and
rubbing
his
temple
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hollo
,
sir
!
<EOS>
if
you
comes
it
this
vay
,
you
'll
fill
one
o
'
them
bags
,
and
something
to
spare
,
at
one
fire
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
the
leather
-
legginged
boy
laughed
very
heartily
,
and
then
tried
to
look
as
if
it
was
somebody
else
,
whereat
Mr
Winkle
frowned
majestically
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
did
you
tell
the
boy
to
meet
us
with
the
snack
,
Martin
?
"
inquired
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Side
of
One
-
tree
Hill
,
at
twelve
o'clock
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
Sir
Geoffrey
's
land
,
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sir
;
but
it
's
close
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
Captain
Boldwig
's
land
;
but
there
'll
be
nobody
to
interrupt
us
,
and
there
's
a
fine
bit
of
turf
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
old
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
the
sooner
we
're
off
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
join
us
at
twelve
,
then
,
Pickwick
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
particularly
desirous
to
view
the
sport
,
the
more
especially
as
he
was
rather
anxious
in
respect
of
Mr
Winkle
's
life
and
limbs
.
 
<EOS>
On
so
inviting
a
morning
,
too
,
it
was
very
tantalising
to
turn
back
,
and
leave
his
friends
to
enjoy
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
,
therefore
,
with
a
very
rueful
air
that
he
replied
---
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
suppose
I
must
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ai
n't
the
gentleman
a
shot
,
Sir
?
"
inquired
the
long
gamekeeper
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Wardle
;
"
and
he
's
lame
besides
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
very
much
like
to
go
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
---
"
very
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
short
pause
of
commiseration
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
barrow
t'other
side
the
hedge
,
"
said
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
the
gentleman
's
servant
would
wheel
along
the
paths
,
he
could
keep
nigh
us
,
and
we
could
lift
it
over
the
stiles
,
and
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
wery
thing
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
who
was
a
party
interested
,
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
he
ardently
longed
to
see
the
sport
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
wery
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Well
said
,
Smallcheek
;
I
'll
have
it
out
in
a
minute
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
here
a
difficulty
arose
.
 
<EOS>
The
long
gamekeeper
resolutely
protested
against
the
introduction
into
a
shooting
party
,
of
a
gentleman
in
a
barrow
,
as
a
gross
violation
of
all
established
rules
and
precedents
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
objection
,
but
not
an
insurmountable
one
.
 
<EOS>
The
gamekeeper
having
been
coaxed
and
feed
,
and
having
,
moreover
,
eased
his
mind
by
"
punching
"
the
head
of
the
inventive
youth
who
had
first
suggested
the
use
of
the
machine
,
Mr
Pickwick
was
placed
in
it
,
and
off
the
party
set
;
Wardle
and
the
long
gamekeeper
leading
the
way
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
in
the
barrow
,
propelled
by
Sam
,
bringing
up
the
rear
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
when
they
had
got
half
across
the
first
field
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
now
?
"
said
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
suffer
this
barrow
to
be
moved
another
step
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
resolutely
,
"
unless
Winkle
carries
that
gun
of
his
in
a
different
manner
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
AM
I
to
carry
it
?
"
said
the
wretched
Winkle
.
<EOS>
"
Carry
it
with
the
muzzle
to
the
ground
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
so
unsportsmanlike
,
"
reasoned
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
whether
it
's
unsportsmanlike
or
not
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
I
am
not
going
to
be
shot
in
a
wheel
-
barrow
,
for
the
sake
of
appearances
,
to
please
anybody
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
gentleman'll
put
that
'
ere
charge
into
somebody
<EOS>
afore
he
's
done
,
"
growled
the
long
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
---
I
do
n't
mind
,
"
said
poor
Winkle
,
turning
his
gun
-
stock
uppermost
---
"
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Anythin
'
for
a
quiet
life
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
;
and
on
they
went
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
after
they
had
gone
a
few
yards
farther
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
now
?
"
said
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
gun
of
Tupman
's
is
not
safe
:
<EOS>
I
know
it
is
n't
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eh
?
 
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
not
safe
?
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
in
a
tone
of
great
alarm
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
as
you
are
carrying
it
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
to
make
any
further
objection
,
but
I
can
not
consent
to
go
on
,
unless
you
carry
it
as
Winkle
does
his
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
had
better
,
sir
,
"
said
the
long
gamekeeper
,
"
or
you
're
quite
as
likely
to
lodge
the
charge
in
yourself
as
in
anything
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
,
with
the
most
obliging
haste
,
placed
his
piece
in
the
position
required
,
and
the
party
moved
on
again
;
the
two
amateurs
marching
with
reversed
arms
,
like
a
couple
of
privates
at
a
royal
funeral
.
   
<EOS>
The
dogs
suddenly
came
to
a
dead
stop
,
and
the
party
advancing
stealthily
a
single
pace
,
stopped
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
with
the
dogs
"
legs
?
"
<EOS>
whispered
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
queer
they
're
standing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
ca
n't
you
?
"
replied
Wardle
softly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
see
,
they
're
making
a
point
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Making
a
point
!
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
staring
about
him
,
as
if
he
expected
to
discover
some
particular
beauty
in
the
landscape
,
which
the
sagacious
animals
were
calling
special
attention
to
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Making
a
point
!
 
<EOS>
What
are
they
pointing
at
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Keep
your
eyes
open
,
"
said
Wardle
,
not
heeding
the
question
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
then
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
sharp
whirring
noise
,
that
made
Mr
Winkle
start
back
as
if
he
had
been
shot
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Bang
,
bang
,
went
a
couple
of
guns
---
the
smoke
swept
quickly
away
over
the
field
,
and
curled
into
the
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
are
they
!
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
in
a
state
of
the
highest
excitement
,
turning
round
and
round
in
all
directions
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
they
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
when
to
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Where
are
they
---
where
are
they
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
are
they
!
"
<EOS>
said
Wardle
,
taking
up
a
brace
of
birds
which
the
dogs
had
deposited
at
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
here
they
are
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
I
mean
the
others
,
"
said
the
bewildered
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Far
enough
off
,
by
this
time
,
"
replied
Wardle
,
coolly
reloading
his
gun
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
shall
very
likely
be
up
with
another
covey
in
five
minutes
,
"
said
the
long
gamekeeper
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
the
gentleman
begins
to
fire
now
,
perhaps
he
'll
just
get
the
shot
out
of
the
barrel
by
the
time
they
rise
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
"
roared
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
compassionating
his
follower
's
confusion
and
embarrassment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
laugh
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
Sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
,
by
way
of
indemnification
,
Mr
Weller
contorted
his
features
from
behind
the
wheel
-
barrow
,
for
the
exclusive
amusement
of
the
boy
with
the
leggings
,
who
thereupon
burst
into
a
boisterous
laugh
,
and
was
summarily
cuffed
by
the
long
gamekeeper
,
who
wanted
a
pretext
for
turning
round
,
to
hide
his
own
merriment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bravo
,
old
fellow
!
"
said
Wardle
to
Mr
Tupman
;
"
you
fired
that
time
,
at
all
events
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
replied
Mr
Tupman
,
with
conscious
pride
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
let
it
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
done
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
hit
something
next
time
,
if
you
look
sharp
.
<EOS>
Very
easy
,
ai
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
's
very
easy
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
it
hurts
one
's
shoulder
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
It
nearly
knocked
me
backwards
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
idea

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
smiling
,
"
you
'll
get
used
to
it
in
time
.
 
<EOS>
Now
then
---
all
ready
---
all
right
with
the
barrow
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
along
,
then
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
hard
,
Sir
,
"
said
Sam
,
raising
the
barrow
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
;
and
on
they
went
,
as
briskly
as
need
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
Keep
that
barrow
back
now
,
"
cried
Wardle
,
when
it
had
been
hoisted
over
a
stile
into
another
field
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
had
been
deposited
in
it
once
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
,
pausing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Winkle
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
"
follow
me
softly
,
and
do
n't
be
too
late
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
fear
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
they
pointing
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
not
now
.
 
<EOS>
Quietly
now
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
On
they
crept
,
and
very
quietly
they
would
have
advanced
,
if
Mr
Winkle
,
in
the
performance
of
some
very
intricate
evolutions
with
his
gun
,
had
not
accidentally
fired
,
at
the
most
critical
moment
,
over
the
boy
's
head
,
exactly
in
the
very
spot
where
the
tall
man
's
brain
would
have
been
,
had
he
been
there
instead
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
on
earth
did
you
do
that
for
?
"
said
old
Wardle
,
as
the
birds
flew
unharmed
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
such
a
gun
in
my
life
,
"
replied
poor
Mr
Winkle
,
looking
at
the
lock
,
as
if
that
would
do
any
good
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
goes
off
of
its
own
accord
.
 
<EOS>
It
WILL
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
do
it
!
"
<EOS>
echoed
Wardle
,
with
something
of
irritation
in
his
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
would
kill
something
of
its
own
accord
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
'll
do
that
afore
long
,
Sir
,
"
observed
the
tall
man
,
in
a
low
,
prophetic
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
that
observation
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Mr
Winkle
,
angrily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
Sir
,
never
mind
,
"
replied
the
long
gamekeeper
;
"
I
've
no
family
myself
,
sir
;
and
this
here
boy
's
mother
will
get
something
handsome
from
Sir
Geoffrey
,
if
he
's
killed
on
his
land
.
<EOS>
Load
again
,
Sir
,
load
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Take
away
his
gun
,
"
cried
Mr
Pickwick
from
the
barrow
,
horror
-
stricken
at
the
long
man
's
dark
insinuations
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
away
his
gun
,
do
you
hear
,
somebody
?
"
   
<EOS>
Nobody
,
however
,
volunteered
to
obey
the
command
;
and
Mr
Winkle
,
after
darting
a
rebellious
glance
at
Mr
Pickwick
,
reloaded
his
gun
,
and
proceeded
onwards
with
the
rest
.
   
<EOS>
We
are
bound
,
on
the
authority
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
to
state
,
that
Mr
Tupman
's
mode
of
proceeding
evinced
far
more
of
prudence
and
deliberation
,
than
that
adopted
by
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
this
by
no
means
detracts
from
the
great
authority
of
the
latter
gentleman
,
on
all
matters
connected
with
the
field
;
because
,
as
Mr
Pickwick
beautifully
observes
,
it
has
somehow
or
other
happened
,
from
time
immemorial
,
that
many
of
the
best
and
ablest
philosophers
,
who
have
been
perfect
lights
of
science
in
matters
of
theory
,
have
been
wholly
unable
to
reduce
them
to
practice
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
's
process
,
like
many
of
our
most
sublime
discoveries
,
was
extremely
simple
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
quickness
and
penetration
of
a
man
of
genius
,
he
had
at
once
observed
that
the
two
great
points
to
be
attained
were
---
first
,
to
discharge
his
piece
without
injury
to
himself
,
and
,
secondly
,
to
do
so
,
without
danger
to
the
bystanders
---
<EOS>
obviously
,
the
best
thing
to
do
,
after
surmounting
the
difficulty
of
firing
at
all
,
was
to
shut
his
eyes
firmly
,
and
fire
into
the
air
.
   
<EOS>
On
one
occasion
,
after
performing
this
feat
,
Mr
Tupman
,
on
opening
his
eyes
,
beheld
a
plump
partridge
in
the
act
of
falling
,
wounded
,
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
on
the
point
of
congratulating
Mr
Wardle
on
his
invariable
success
,
when
that
gentleman
advanced
towards
him
,
and
grasped
him
warmly
by
the
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tupman
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
"
you
singled
out
that
particular
bird
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
---
"
no
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
did
,
"
said
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
saw
you
do
it
<EOS>
---
I
observed
you
pick
him
out
---
I
noticed
you
,
as
you
raised
your
piece
to
take
aim
;
and
I
will
say
this
,
that
the
best
shot
in
existence
could
not
have
done
it
more
beautifully
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
an
older
hand
at
this
than
I
thought
you
,
Tupman
;
you
have
been
out
before
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
in
vain
for
Mr
Tupman
to
protest
,
with
a
smile
of
self
-
denial
,
that
he
never
had
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
smile
was
taken
as
evidence
to
the
contrary
;
and
from
that
time
forth
his
reputation
was
established
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
the
only
reputation
that
has
been
acquired
as
easily
,
nor
are
such
fortunate
circumstances
confined
to
partridge
-
shooting
.
   
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Mr
Winkle
flashed
,
and
blazed
,
and
smoked
away
,
without
producing
any
material
results
worthy
of
being
noted
down
;
sometimes
expending
his
charge
in
mid
-
air
,
and
at
others
sending
it
skimming
along
so
near
the
surface
of
the
ground
as
to
place
the
lives
of
the
two
dogs
on
a
rather
uncertain
and
precarious
tenure
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
display
of
fancy
-
shooting
,
it
was
extremely
varied
and
curious
;
as
an
exhibition
of
firing
with
any
precise
object
,
it
was
,
upon
the
whole
,
perhaps
a
failure
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
an
established
axiom
,
that
"
every
bullet
has
its
billet
.
<EOS>
"
 
If
it
apply
in
an
equal
degree
to
shot
,
those
of
Mr
Winkle
were
unfortunate
foundlings
,
deprived
of
their
natural
rights
,
cast
loose
upon
the
world
,
and
billeted
nowhere
.
"
Well
,
"
said
Wardle
,
walking
up
to
the
side
of
the
barrow
,
and
wiping
the
streams
of
perspiration
from
his
jolly
red
face
;
"
smoking
day
,
is
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
indeed
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
is
tremendously
hot
,
even
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
you
must
feel
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
"
pretty
hot
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
past
twelve
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
that
green
hill
there
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Certainly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
place
where
we
are
to
lunch
;
and
,
by
Jove
,
there
's
the
boy
with
the
basket
,
punctual
as
clockwork
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
he
is
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
brightening
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
boy
,
that
.
<EOS>
I
'll
give
him
a
shilling
,
presently
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
then
,
Sam
,
wheel
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Hold
on
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
invigorated
with
the
prospect
of
refreshments
.
 
<EOS>
"
Out
of
the
vay
,
young
leathers
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
walley

precious

said
to
the
driver
when
they
was
a
-
carryin
'
him
to
Tyburn
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
quickening
his
pace
to
a
sharp
run
,
Mr
Weller
wheeled
his
master
nimbly
to
the
green
hill
,
shot
him
dexterously
out
by
the
very
side
of
the
basket
,
and
proceeded
to
unpack
it
with
the
utmost
despatch
.
   
<EOS>
"
Weal
pie
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
soliloquising
,
as
he
arranged
the
eatables
on
the
grass
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wery
good

Mr

Mr

did

did
that
,
and
begun
at
two
yards
;
but
he
never
tried
it
on
agin
;
for
he
blowed
the
bird
right
clean
away
at
the
first
fire
,
and
nobody
ever
seed
a

him

Sam

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir

"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
the
goodness
to
reserve
your
anecdotes
till
they
are
called
for

"
   
<EOS>
"
Cert'nly
,
sir

"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Weller
winked
the
eye
which
was
not
concealed
by
the
beer
-
can
he
was
raising
to
his
lips
,
with
such
exquisite
facetiousness
,
that
the
two
boys
went
into
spontaneous
convulsions
,
and
even
the
long
man
condescended
to
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
that
certainly
is
most
capital
cold
punch
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
earnestly
at
the
stone
bottle
;
"
and
the
day
is
extremely
warm
,
and
---
 
Tupman
,
my
dear
friend
,
a
glass
of
punch
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
the
greatest
delight
,
"
replied
Mr
Tupman
;
and
having
drank
that
glass
,
Mr
Pickwick
took
another
,
just
to
see
whether
there
was
any
orange
peel
in
the
punch
,
because
orange
peel
always
disagreed
with
him
;
and
finding
that
there
was
not
,
Mr
Pickwick
took
another
glass
to
the
health
of
their
absent
friend
,
and
then
felt
himself
imperatively
called
upon
to
propose
another
in
honour
of
the
punch
-
compounder
,
unknown
.
   
<EOS>
This
constant
succession
of
glasses
produced
considerable
effect
upon
Mr
Pickwick
;
his
countenance
beamed
with
the
most
sunny
smiles
,
laughter
played
around
his
lips
,
and
good
-
humoured
merriment
twinkled
in
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Yielding
by
degrees
to
the
influence
of
the
exciting
liquid
,
rendered
more
so
by
the
heat
,
Mr
Pickwick
expressed
a
strong
desire
to
recollect
a
song
which
he
had
heard
in
his
infancy
,
and
the
attempt
proving
abortive
,
sought
to
stimulate
his
memory
with
more
glasses
of
punch
,
which
appeared
to
have
quite
a
contrary
effect
;
for
,
from
forgetting
the
words
of
the
song
,
he
began
to
forget
how
to
articulate
any
words
at
all
;
and
finally
,
after
rising
to
his
legs
to
address
the
company
in
an
eloquent
speech
,
he
fell
into
the
barrow
,
and
fast
asleep
,
simultaneously
.
   
<EOS>
The
basket
having
been
repacked
,
and
it
being
found
perfectly
impossible
to
awaken
Mr
Pickwick
from
his
torpor
,
some
discussion
took
place
whether
it
would
be
better
for
Mr
Weller
to
wheel
his
master
back
again
,
or
to
leave
him
where
he
was
,
until
they
should
all
be
ready
to
return
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
course
was
at
length
decided
on
;
and
as
the
further
expedition
was
not
to
exceed
an
hour
's
duration
,
and
as
Mr
Weller
begged
very
hard
to
be
one
of
the
party
,
it
was
determined
to
leave
Mr
Pickwick
asleep
in
the
barrow
,
and
to
call
for
him
on
their
return
.
 
<EOS>
So
away
they
went
,
leaving
Mr
Pickwick
snoring
most
comfortably
in
the
shade
.
   
<EOS>
That
Mr
Pickwick
would
have
continued
to
snore
in
the
shade
until
his
friends
came
back
,
or
,
in
default
thereof
,
until
the
shades
of
evening
had
fallen
on
the
landscape
,
there
appears
no
reasonable
cause
to
doubt
;
always
supposing
that
he
had
been
suffered
to
remain
there
in
peace
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
NOT
suffered
to
remain
there
in
peace
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
was
what
prevented
him
.
   
<EOS>
Captain
Boldwig
was
a
little
fierce
man
in
a
stiff
black
neckerchief
and
blue
surtout
,
who
,
when
he
did
condescend
to
walk
about
his
property
,
did
it
in
company
with
a
thick
rattan
stick
with
a
brass
ferrule
,
and
a
gardener
and
sub
-
gardener
with
meek
faces
,
to
whom
(
the
gardeners
,
not
the
stick
)
<EOS>
Captain
Boldwig
gave
his
orders
with
all
due
grandeur
and
ferocity
;
for
Captain
Boldwig
's
wife
's
sister
had
married
a
marquis
,
and
the
captain
's
house
was
a
villa
,
and
his
land
"
grounds
,
"
and
it
was
all
very
high
,
and
mighty
,
and
great
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
had
not
been
asleep
half
an
hour
when
little
Captain
Boldwig
,
followed
by
the
two
gardeners
,
came
striding
along
as
fast
as
his
size
and
importance
would
let
him
;
and
when
he
came
near
the
oak
tree
,
Captain
Boldwig
paused
and
drew
a
long
breath
,
and
looked
at
the
prospect
as
if
he
thought
the
prospect
ought
to
be
highly
gratified
at
having
him
to
take
notice
of
it
;
and
then
he
struck
the
ground
emphatically
with
his
stick
,
and
summoned
the
head
-
gardener
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hunt

"
said
Captain
Boldwig
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes

said
the
gardener

"

out

<EOS>
Do

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not

it
,
Sir

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon

"
said
the
other
man
,
advancing
,
with
his
hand
to
his
hat
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Wilkins
,
what
's
the

with

"
said
Captain
Boldwig
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon

but
I

there
have
been
trespassers
here
to

"
   
<EOS>
"
Ha

<EOS>
"
said
the
captain
,
scowling
around
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes

they
have
been
dining
here
,
I
think
,
sir

"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
damn
their
audacity
,
so
they
have
,
"
said
Captain
Boldwig
,
as
the
crumbs
and
fragments
that
were
strewn
upon
the
grass
met
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
have
actually
been
devouring
their
food
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
the
vagabonds
here
!
"
said
the
captain
,
clenching
the
thick
stick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
the
vagabonds
here
,
"
said
the
captain
wrathfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
Beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
said
Wilkins
,
"
<EOS>
but
---
"
   
"
But
what
?
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
"
roared
the
captain
;
and
following
the
timid
glance
of
Wilkins
,
his
eyes
encountered
the
wheel
-
barrow
and
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
are
you
,
you
rascal
?
"
said
the
captain
,
administering
several
pokes
to
Mr
Pickwick
's
body
with
the
thick
stick
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
your
name
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cold
punch
,
"
murmured
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
he
sank
to
sleep
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
demanded
Captain
Boldwig
.
   
<EOS>
No
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
say
his
name
was
?
"
asked
the
captain
.
   
<EOS>
"
Punch
,
I
think
,
sir

"
replied
Wilkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
his
impudence
---
that
's
his
confounded
impudence

"
said
Captain
Boldwig
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
only
feigning
to
be
asleep
now
,
"
said
the
captain
,
in
a
high
passion
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
drunk
;
he
's
a
drunken
plebeian

<EOS>
Wheel
him
away

Wilkins
,
wheel
him
away
directly
.
"
<EOS>
"
Where
shall
I
wheel
him
to
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Wilkins
,
with
great
timidity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wheel
him
to
the
devil
,
"
replied
Captain
Boldwig
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well

"
said
Wilkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stay

"
said
the
captain
.
   
<EOS>
Wilkins
stopped
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wheel
him
,
"
said
the
captain
---
"
wheel
him
to
the
pound

and
let
us
see
whether
he
calls
himself

comes
to

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
Wheel
him
away

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Away
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
wheeled
in
compliance
with
this
imperious
mandate
;
and
the
great
Captain
Boldwig
,
swelling
with
indignation
,
proceeded
on
his
walk
.
   
<EOS>
Inexpressible
was
the
astonishment
of
the
little
party
when
they
returned
,
to
find
that
Mr
Pickwick
had
disappeared
,
and
taken
the
wheel
-
barrow
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
most
mysterious
and
unaccountable
thing
that
was
ever
heard
of
For
a
lame
man
to
have
got
upon
his
legs
without
any
previous
notice
,
and
walked
off
,
would
have
been
most
extraordinary
;
but
when
it
came
to
his
wheeling
a
heavy
barrow
before
him
,
by
way
of
amusement
,
it
grew
positively
miraculous
.
 
<EOS>
They
searched
every
nook
and
corner
round
,
together
and
separately
;
they
shouted
,
whistled
,
laughed
,
called
---
and
all
with
the
same
result
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
not
to
be
found
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
hours
of
fruitless
search
,
they
arrived
at
the
unwelcome
conclusion
that
they
must
go
home
without
him
.
   
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Mr
Pickwick
had
been
wheeled
to
the
pound
,
and
safely
deposited
therein
,
fast
asleep
in
the
wheel
-
barrow
,
to
the
immeasurable
delight
and
satisfaction
not
only
of
all
the
boys
in
the
village
,
but
three
-
fourths
of
the
whole
population
,
who
had
gathered
round
,
in
expectation
of
his
waking
.
 
<EOS>
If
their
most
intense
gratification
had
been
awakened
by
seeing
him
wheeled
in
,
how
many
hundredfold
was
their
joy
increased
<EOS>
when
,
after
a
few
indistinct
cries
of
"
Sam
!
"
he
sat
up
in
the
barrow
,
and
gazed
with
indescribable
astonishment
on
the
faces
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
A
general
shout
was
of
course
the
signal
of
his
having
woke
up
;
and
his
involuntary
inquiry
of
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
occasioned
another
,
louder
than
the
first
,
if
possible
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
game
!
"
<EOS>
roared
the
populace
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
am
I
?
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
pound
,
"
replied
the
mob
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
came
I
here
?
 
<EOS>
What
was
I
doing
?
 
<EOS>
Where
was
I
brought
from
?
"
<EOS>
"
Boldwig
!
 
<EOS>
Captain
Boldwig
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
only
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
out
,
"
cried
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
's
my
servant
?
<EOS>
Where
are
my
friends
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
ai
n't
got
no
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
<EOS>
"
Then
there
came
a
turnip
,
then
a
potato
,
and
then
an
egg
;
with
a
few
other
little
tokens
of
the
playful
disposition
of
the
many
-
headed
.
   
<EOS>
How
long
this
scene
might
have
lasted
,
or
how
much
Mr
Pickwick
might
have
suffered
,
no
one
can
tell
,
had
not
a
carriage
,
which
was
driving
swiftly
by
,
suddenly
pulled
up
,
from
whence
there
descended
old
Wardle
and
Sam
Weller
,
the
former
of
whom
,
in
far
less
time
than
it
takes
to
write
it
,
if
not
to
read
it
,
had
made
his
way
to
Mr
Pickwick
's
side
,
and
placed
him
in
the
vehicle
,
just
as
the
latter
had
concluded
the
third
and
last
round
of
a
single
combat
with
the
town
-
beadle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Run
to
the
justice
's
!
"
cried
a
dozen
voices
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
run
avay
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
jumping
up
on
the
box
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
my
compliments
---
Mr
Veller
's
compliments
---
to
the
justice

and
tell
him
I
've
spiled
his
beadle
,
and
that
,
if
he
'll
swear
in
a
new

un

I
'll
come
back
again
to

morrow
and
spile
him
.
 
<EOS>
Drive
on
,
old
feller
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
give
directions
for
the
commencement
of
an
action
for
false
imprisonment
against
this
Captain
Boldwig
,
directly
I
get
to
London
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
soon
as
the
carriage
turned
out
of
the
town
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
were
trespassing
,
it
seems
,
"
said
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
I
'll
bring
the
action
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
you
wo
n't
,
"
said
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
by
---
"
<EOS>
But
as
there
was
a
humorous
expression
in
Wardle
's
face
,
Mr
Pickwick
checked
himself
,
and
said
,
"
Why
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Because
,
"
said
old
Wardle
,
half
-
bursting
with
laughter
,
"
because
they
might
turn
on
some
of
us
,
and
say
we
had
taken
too
much
cold
punch
.
"
   
Do
what
he
would
,
a
smile
would
come
into
Mr
Pickwick
's
face
;
the
smile
extended
into
a
laugh
;
the
laugh
into
a
roar
;
the
roar
became
general
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
to
keep
up
their
good
-
humour
,
they
stopped
at
the
first
roadside
tavern
they
came
to
,
and
ordered
a
glass
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
all
round
,
with
a
magnum
of
extra
strength
for
Mr
Samuel
Weller

aforesaid
clerks
catching
as
favourable
glimpses
of
heaven
's
light
and
heaven
's
sun
,
in
the
course
of
their
daily
labours
,
as
a
man
might
hope
to
do
,
were
he
placed
at
the
bottom
of
a
reasonably
deep
well
;
and
without
the
opportunity
of
perceiving
the
stars
in
the
day
-
time
,
which
the
latter
secluded
situation
affords
.
   
<EOS>
The
clerks
"
office
of
Messrs.
Dodson
&
Fogg
was
a
dark
,
mouldy
,
earthy
-
smelling
room
,
with
a
high
wainscotted
partition
to
screen
the
clerks
from
the
vulgar
gaze
,
a
couple
of
old
wooden
chairs
,
a
very
loud
-
ticking
clock
,
an
almanac
,
an
umbrella
-
stand
,
a
row
of
hat
-
pegs
,
and
a
few
shelves
,
on
which
were
deposited
several
ticketed
bundles
of
dirty
papers
,
some
old
deal
boxes
with
paper
labels
,
and
sundry
decayed
stone
ink
bottles
of
various
shapes
and
sizes
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
glass
door
leading
into
the
passage
which
formed
the
entrance
to
the
court
,
and
on
the
outer
side
of
this
glass
door
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
closely
followed
by
Sam
Weller
,
presented
himself
on
the
Friday
morning
succeeding
the
occurrence
of
which
a
faithful
narration
is
given
in
the
last
chapter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
ca
n't
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
a
voice
from
behind
the
partition
,
in
reply
to
Mr
Pickwick
's
gentle
tap
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mr
Pickwick
and
Sam
entered
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dodson
or
Mr
Fogg
at
home
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
,
gently
,
advancing
,
hat
in
hand
,
towards
the
partition
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dodson
ai
n't
at
home
,
and
Mr
Fogg
's
particularly
engaged
,
"
replied
the
voice
;
and
at
the
same
time
the
head
to
which
the
voice
belonged
,
with
a
pen
behind
its
ear
,
looked
over
the
partition
,
and
at
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
it
was
a
ragged
head
,
the
sandy
hair
of
which
,
scrupulously
parted
on
one
side
,
and
flattened
down
with
pomatum
,
was
twisted
into
little
semi
-
circular
tails
<EOS>
round
a
flat
face
ornamented
with
a
pair
of
small
eyes
,
and
garnished
with
a
very
dirty
shirt
collar
,
and
a
rusty
black
stock
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dodson
ai
n't
at
home
,
and
Mr
Fogg
's
particularly
engaged
,
"
said
the
man
to
whom
the
head
belonged
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
will
Mr
Dodson
be
back
,
sir
?
"
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
"
Ca
n't
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Will
it
be
long
before
Mr
Fogg
is
disengaged
,
Sir
?
"
   
"
Do
n't
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
the
man
proceeded
to
mend
his
pen
with
great
deliberation
,
while
another
clerk
,
who
was
mixing
a
Seidlitz
powder
,
under
cover
of
the
lid
of
his
desk
,
laughed
approvingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
'll
wait
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
reply
;
so
Mr
Pickwick
sat
down
unbidden
,
and
listened
to
the
loud
ticking
of
the
clock
and
the
murmured
conversation
of
the
clerks
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
was
a
game
,
was
n't
it
?
"
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
,
in
a
brown
coat
and
brass
buttons
,
inky
drabs
,
and
bluchers
,
at
the
conclusion
of
some
inaudible
relation
of
his
previous
evening
's
adventures
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Devilish
good
---
<EOS>
devilish
good
,
"
said
the
Seidlitz
-
powder
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tom
Cummins
was
in
the
chair
,
"
said
the
man
with
the
brown
coat
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
half
-
past
four
when
I
got
to
Somers
Town
,
and
then
I
was
so
uncommon
lushy
,
that
I
could
n't
find
the
place
where
the
latch
-
key
went
in
,
and
was
obliged
to
knock
up
the
old
"
ooman
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
wonder
what
old
<EOS>
Fogg
'
ud
say
,
if
he
knew
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
get
the
sack
,
I
s'pose
---
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
humorous
notion
,
all
the
clerks
laughed
in
concert
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
was
such
a
game
with
Fogg
here
,
this
mornin
'
,
"
said
the
man
in
the
brown
coat
,
"
while
Jack
was
upstairs
sorting
the
papers
,
and
you
two
were
gone
to
the
stamp
-
office
.
 
<EOS>
Fogg
was
down
here
,
opening
the
letters
when
that
chap
as
we
issued
the
writ
against
at
Camberwell
<EOS>
,
you
know
,
came
in
---
what
's
his
name
again
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ramsey
,
"
said
the
clerk
who
had
spoken
to
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Ramsey
---
a
precious
seedy
-
looking
customer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
says
old
Fogg
,
looking
at
him
very
fierce
<EOS>
---
you
know
his
way
---
"
well
,
Sir
,
have
you
come
to
settle
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
,
sir
,
"
said
Ramsey
,
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
bringing
out
the
money
,
"
the
debt
's
two
pound
ten
,
and
the
costs
three
pound
five
,
and
here
it
is
,
Sir
;
"
and
he
sighed
like
bricks
,
as
he
lugged
out
the
money
,
done
up
in
a
bit
of
blotting
-
paper
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Fogg
looked
first
at
the
money
,
and
then
at
him
,
and
then
he
coughed
in
his
rum
way
,
so
that
I
knew
something
was
coming
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
there
's
a
declaration
filed
,
which
increases
the
costs
materially
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Fogg
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
say
that
,
sir
,
"
said
Ramsey
,
starting
back
;
"
the
time
was
only
out
last
night
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
say
it
,
though
,
"
said
Fogg
,
"
my
clerk
's
just
gone
to
file
it
.
 
<EOS>
Has
n't
Mr
Jackson
gone
to
file
that
declaration
in
Bullman
and
Ramsey
,
Mr
Wicks
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Of
course
I
said
yes
,
<EOS>
and
then
Fogg
coughed
again
,
and
looked
at
Ramsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
God
!
"
said
Ramsey
;
"
and
here
have
I
nearly
driven
myself
mad
,
scraping
this
money
together
,
and
all
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
None
at
all
,
"
said
Fogg
coolly
;
"
<EOS>
so
you
had
better
go
back
and
scrape
some
more
together
,
and
bring
it
here
in
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
get
it
,
by
God
!
"
<EOS>
said
Ramsey
,
striking
the
desk
with
his
fist
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
bully
me
,
sir
,
"
said
Fogg
,
getting
into
a
passion
on
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
bullying
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Ramsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
,
"
said
Fogg
;
"
get
out
,
sir
;
get
out
of
this
office
,
Sir
,
and
come
back
,
Sir
,
when
you
know
how
to
behave
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Ramsey
tried
to
speak
,
but
Fogg
would
n't
let
him
,
so
he
put
the
money
in
his
pocket
,
and
sneaked
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
was
scarcely
shut
,
when
old
Fogg
turned
round
to
me
,
with
a
sweet
smile
on
his
face
,
and
drew
the
declaration
out
of
his
coat
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
Wicks
,
"
says
Fogg
,
"
take
a
cab
,
and
go
down
to
the
Temple
as
quick
as
you
can
,
and
file
that
.
 
<EOS>
The
costs
are
quite
safe
,
for
he
's
a
steady
man
with
a
large
family
,
at
a
salary
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
shillings
a
week
,
and
if
he
gives
us
a
warrant
of
attorney
,
as
he
must
in
the
end
,
I
know
his
employers
will
see
it
paid
;
so
we
may
as
well
get
all
we
can
get
out
of
him
,
Mr
Wicks
;
it
's
a
Christian
act
to
do
it
,
Mr
Wicks
,
for
with
his
large
family
and
small
income
,
he
'll
be
all
the
better
for
a
good
lesson
against
getting
into
debt
---
wo
n't
he
,
Mr
Wicks
,
wo
n't
he
?
"
<EOS>
---
and
he
smiled
so
good
-
naturedly
as
he
went
away
,
that
it
was
delightful
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
capital
man
of
business
,
"
said
Wicks
,
in
a
tone
of
the
deepest
admiration
,
"
capital
,
is
n't
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
other
three
cordially
subscribed
to
this
opinion
,
and
the
anecdote
afforded
the
most
unlimited
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nice
men
these
here
,
Sir
,
"
whispered
Mr
Weller
to
his
master
;
"
wery
nice
notion
of
fun
<EOS>
they
has
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
nodded
assent
,
and
coughed
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
young
gentlemen
behind
the
partition
,
who
,
having
now
relaxed
their
minds
by
a
little
conversation
among
themselves
,
condescended
to
take
some
notice
of
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
Fogg
's
disengaged
now
?
"
said
Jackson
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
see
,
"
said
Wicks
,
dismounting
leisurely
from
his
stool
.
<EOS>
"
What
name
shall
I
tell
Mr
Fogg
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pickwick
,
"
replied
the
illustrious
subject
of
these
memoirs
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jackson
departed
upstairs
on
his
errand
,
and
immediately
returned
with
a
message
that
Mr
Fogg
would
see
Mr
Pickwick
in
five
minutes
;
and
having
delivered
it
,
returned
again
to
his
desk
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
say
his
name
was
?
"
<EOS>
whispered
Wicks
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pickwick
,
"
replied
Jackson
;
"
it
's
the
defendant
in
Bardell
and
Pickwick
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
sudden
scraping
of
feet
,
mingled
with
the
sound
of
suppressed
laughter
,
was
heard
from
behind
the
partition
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
're
a
-
twiggin
'
of
you
,
Sir
,
"
whispered
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Twigging
of
me
,
Sam
!
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
what
do
you
mean
by
twigging
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
replied
by
pointing
with
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
,
on
looking
up
,
became
sensible
of
the
pleasing
fact
,
that
all
the
four
clerks
,
with
countenances
expressive
of
the
utmost
amusement
,
and
with
their
heads
thrust
over
the
wooden
screen
,
were
minutely
inspecting
the
figure
and
general
appearance
of
the
supposed
trifler
with
female
hearts
,
and
disturber
of
female
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
looking
up
,
the
row
of
heads
suddenly
disappeared
,
and
the
sound
of
pens
travelling
at
a
furious
rate
over
paper
,
immediately
succeeded
.
   
<EOS>
A
sudden
ring
at
the
bell
which
hung
in
the
office
,
summoned
Mr
Jackson
to
the
apartment
of
Fogg
,
from
whence
he
came
back
to
say
that
he
(
Fogg
)
was
ready
to
see
Mr
Pickwick
if
he
would
step
upstairs
.
<EOS>
Upstairs
Mr
Pickwick
did
step
accordingly
,
leaving
Sam
Weller
below
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
door
of
the
one
-
pair
back
,
bore
inscribed
in
legible
characters
the
imposing
words
,
"
Mr
Fogg
"
;
and
,
having
tapped
thereat
,
and
been
desired
to
come
in
,
Jackson
ushered
Mr
Pickwick
into
the
presence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr
Dodson
in
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Fogg
.
   
<EOS>
"
Just
come
in
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Jackson
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ask
him
to
step
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
Exit
Jackson
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
a
seat
,
sir
,
"
said
Fogg
;
"
there
is
the
paper
,
sir
;
my
partner
will
be
here
directly
,
and
we
can
converse
about
this
matter
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
took
a
seat
and
the
paper
,
but
,
instead
of
reading
the
latter
,
peeped
over
the
top
of
it
,
and
took
a
survey
of
the
man
of
business
,
who
was
an
elderly
,
pimply
-
faced
,
vegetable
-
diet
sort
of
man
,
in
a
black
coat
,
dark
mixture
trousers
,
and
small
black
gaiters
;
a
kind
of
being
who
seemed
to
be
an
essential
part
of
the
desk
at
which
he
was
writing
,
and
to
have
as
much
thought
or
feeling
.
   
<EOS>
After
a
few
minutes
"
silence
,
Mr
Dodson
,
a
plump
,
portly
,
stern
-
looking
man
,
with
a
loud
voice
,
appeared
;
and
the
conversation
commenced
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
said
Fogg
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
the
defendant
,
Sir
,
in
Bardell
and
Pickwick
?
"
said
Dodson
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
said
Dodson
,
"
and
what
do
you
propose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Fogg
,
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
trousers
"
pockets
,
and
throwing
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
"
what
do
you
propose
,
Mr
Pickwick
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
Fogg
,
"
said
Dodson
,
"
let
me
hear
what
Mr
Pickwick
has
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
came
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
gazing
placidly
on
the
two
partners
,
"
I
came
here
,
gentlemen
,
to
express
the
surprise
with
which
I
received
your
letter
of
the
other
day
,
and
to
inquire
what
grounds
of
action
you
can
have
against
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Grounds
of
---
"
<EOS>
Fogg
had
ejaculated
this
much
,
when
he
was
stopped
by
Dodson
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Fogg
,
"
said
Dodson
,
"
I
am
going
to
speak
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr
Dodson
,
"
said
Fogg
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
the
grounds
of
action
,
sir
,
"
continued
Dodson
,
with
moral
elevation
in
his
air
,
"
you
will
consult
your
own
conscience
and
your
own
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
We
,
Sir
,
we
,
are
guided
entirely
by
the
statement
of
our
client
.
 
<EOS>
That
statement
,
Sir

may
be
true

or
it
may

I
do
not
hesitate
to
say
,
Sir

that
our
grounds
of
action

Sir

are
strong

not

You
may
be
an
unfortunate
man

Sir

you
may

a
designing

I
were
called
upon

Sir

to
express
an
opinion

your

I

one

<EOS>
Here
Dodson
drew
himself
up
,
with
an
air
of
offended
virtue
,
and
looked
at
Fogg
,
who
thrust
his
hands
farther
in
his
pockets
,
and
nodding
his
head
sagely
,
said
,
in
a
tone
of
the
fullest
concurrence
,
"
Most
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
considerable
pain
depicted
in
his
countenance
,
"
you
will
permit
me
to
assure
you
that
I
am
a
most
unfortunate

so
far

this

concerned

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you

"
replied
Dodson
;
"
I
trust
you
may
be

Sir

<EOS>
If
you
are
really
innocent
of
what
is
laid
to
your

you
are
more
unfortunate
than
I
had
believed
any

possibly
be

<EOS>
What
do
you
say

Mr
Fogg

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
precisely
what

Fogg

with
a

of
incredulity

<EOS>
The

All

Dodson
coughed
and
looked
at
Fogg
,
who
said
"
Perfectly

"
also
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
they
both
looked
at
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
to
understand
,
then
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
that
it
really
is
your
intention
to
proceed
with
this
action

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Understand
,
sir

---
<EOS>
that
you
certainly
may
,
"
replied
Dodson
,
with
something
as
near
a
smile
as
his
importance
would
allow
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
that
the
damages
are
actually
laid
at
fifteen
hundred
pounds
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
which
understanding
you
may
add
my
assurance
,
that
if
we
could
have
prevailed
upon
our
client
,
they
would
have
been
laid
at
treble
the
amount
,
sir
,
"
replied
Dodson
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
Mrs
Bardell
specially
said
,
however
,
"
observed
Fogg
,
glancing
at
Dodson
,
"
that
she
would
not
compromise
for
a
farthing
less
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Unquestionably
,
"
replied
Dodson
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
action
was
only
just
begun
;
and
it
would
n't
have
done
to
let
Mr
Pickwick
compromise
it
then
,
even
if
he
had
been
so
disposed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
you
offer
no
terms

"
said
Dodson
,
displaying
a
slip
of
parchment
in
his
right
hand
,
and
affectionately
pressing
a
paper
copy
of
it
,
on
Mr
Pickwick
with
his
left

"

Mr

rising
in

wrath
at
the

time
;

<EOS>

rubbing

opening

<EOS>
"

And
before

the
excited
Mr

turning
round
on

<EOS>

I

disgraceful

<EOS>
"
I
did

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
thoroughly
roused
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
said
,

that
of

"
You

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"

if

disposed

now

<EOS>
"
I
do

said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very

Dodson
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
hear
down
there

I
hope
,
Mr

"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

yes

"
said
Wicks
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
come
up
a
step

two

added
Mr
Fogg
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
on

Sir

do
go
on

<EOS>
You
had
better
call
us

perhaps
You
would
like

assault
one
Of

<EOS>
Pray
do
it

we

not

"
   
<EOS>
As
Fogg
put
himself
very
temptingly
within
the
reach
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
clenched
fist
,
there
is
little
doubt
that
that
gentleman
would
have
complied
with
his
earnest
entreaty
,
but
for
the
interposition
of
Sam
,
who
,
hearing
the
dispute
,
emerged
from
the
office
,
mounted
the
stairs
,
and
seized
his
master
by
the
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
just
come
away
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
Battledore

<EOS>
If
you
want
to
ease
your
mind
by
blowing
up
somebody
,
come
out
into
the
court
and
blow
up
me
;
but
it
's
rayther
too
expensive
work
to
be
carried
on
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
And
without
the
slightest
ceremony
,
Mr
Weller
hauled
his
master
down
the
stairs
,
and
down
the
court
,
and
having
safely
deposited
him
in
Cornhill
,
fell
behind
,
prepared
to
follow
whithersoever
he
should
lead
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
walked
on
abstractedly
,
crossed
opposite
the
Mansion
House
,
and
bent
his
steps
up
Cheapside
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
began
to
wonder
where
they
were
going
,
when
his
master
turned
round
,
and
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
I
will
go
immediately
to
Mr
Perker
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
exactly
the
wery
place
<EOS>
vere
you
ought
to
have
gone
last
night
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
"
I
KNOW
it
is
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
Sam
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
we
will
go
there
at
once
;
but
<EOS>
first
,
as
I
have
been
rather
ruffled
,
I
should
like
a
glass
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
warm
,
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
Where
can
I
have
it
,
Sam
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
's
knowledge
of
London
was
extensive
and
peculiar
.
<EOS>
He
replied
,
without
the
slightest
consideration
---
   
<EOS>
"
Second
court
on
the
right
hand
side
---
last
house
but
vun
on
the
same
side
the
vay
---
take
the
box
as
stands
in
the
first
fireplace
,
"
cos
there
ai
n't
no
leg
in
the
middle
o
'
the
table
,
which
all
the
others
has
,
and
it
's
wery
inconvenient
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
observed
his
valet
's
directions
implicitly
,
and
bidding
Sam
follow
him
,
entered
the
tavern
he
had
pointed
out
,
where
the
hot
brandy
-
and
-
water
was
speedily
placed
before
him
;
while
Mr
Weller
,
seated
at
a
respectful
distance
,
though
at
the
same
table
with
his
master
,
was
accommodated
with
a
pint
of
porter
.
   
<EOS>
The
room
was
one
of
a
very
homely
description
,
and
was
apparently
under
the
especial
patronage
of
stage
-
coachmen
;
for
several
gentleman
,
who
had
all
the
appearance
of
belonging
to
that
learned
profession
,
were
drinking
and
smoking
in
the
different
boxes
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
number
was
one
stout
,
red
-
faced
,
elderly
man
,
in
particular
,
seated
in
an
opposite
box
,
who
attracted
Mr
Pickwick
's
attention
.
 
<EOS>
The
stout
man
was
smoking
with
great
vehemence
,
but
between
every
half
-
dozen
puffs
,
he
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
,
and
looked
first
at
Mr
Weller
and
then
at
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
would
bury
in
a
quart
pot
,
as
much
of
his
countenance
as
the
dimensions
of
the
quart
pot
admitted
of
its
receiving
,
and
take
another
look
at
Sam
and
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
would
take
another
half
-
dozen
puffs
with
an
air
of
profound
meditation
and
look
at
them
again
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
the
stout
man
,
putting
up
his
legs
on
the
seat
,
and
leaning
his
back
against
the
wall
,
began
to
puff
at
his
pipe
without
leaving
off
at
all
,
and
to
stare
through
the
smoke
at
the
new
-
comers
,
as
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
see
the
most
he
could
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
At
first
the
evolutions
of
the
stout
man
had
escaped
Mr
Weller
's
observation
,
but
by
degrees
,
as
he
saw
Mr
Pickwick
's
eyes
every
now
and
then
turning
towards
him
,
he
began
to
gaze
in
the
same
direction
,
at
the
same
time
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
,
as
if
he
partially
recognised
the
object
before
him
,
and
wished
to
make
quite
sure
of
its
identity
.
 
<EOS>
His
doubts
were
speedily
dispelled
,
however
;
for
the
stout
man
having
blown
a
thick
cloud
from
his
pipe
,
a
hoarse
voice
,
like
some
strange
effort
of
ventriloquism
,
emerged
from
beneath
the
capacious
shawls
which
muffled
his
throat
and
chest
,
and
slowly
uttered
these
sounds
---
"
Wy
,
Sammy
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
that
,
Sam
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
would
n't
ha
'
believed
it
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
,
with
astonished
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
old
'
un
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Old
one
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
old
one
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
father
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
,
my
ancient
?
"
<EOS>
And
with
this
beautiful
ebullition
of
filial
affection
,
Mr
Weller
made
room
on
the
seat
beside
him
,
for
the
stout
man
,
who
advanced
pipe
in
mouth
and
pot
in
hand
,
to
greet
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wy
,
Sammy
,
"
said
the
father
,
"
<EOS>
I
ha'n't
seen
you
,
for
two
year
and
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nor
more

"
replied
the
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
's
mother
-
in
-
law
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wy
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
Sammy
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
senior
,
with
much
solemnity
in
his
manner
;
"
there
never
was
a
nicer
woman
as
a
widder
,
than
that
'
ere
second
wentur
o
'
mine
---
a
sweet
creetur
<EOS>
she
was
,
Sammy
;
all
I
can
say
on
her
now
,
is
,
that
as
she
was
such
an
uncommon
pleasant
widder
,
it
's
a
great
pity
she
ever
changed
her
condition
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
n't
act
as
a
vife
,
Sammy
.
"
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
she
,
though
?
"
inquired
Mr
Weller
,
junior
.
   
<EOS>
The
elder
Mr
Weller
shook
his
head
,
as
he
replied
with
a
sigh
,
"
I
've
done
it
once
too
often
,
Sammy
;
I
've
done
it
once
too
often

<EOS>
Take

my

and
be
wery
careful

widders
all
your
life

"
specially
if
they
've
kept
a
public
-
house
,
Sammy
.
"
 
<EOS>
Having
delivered
this
parental
advice
with
great
pathos
,
Mr
Weller
,
senior
,
refilled
his
pipe
from
a
tin
box
he
carried
in
his
pocket
;
and
,
lighting
his
fresh
pipe
from
the
ashes
of
the
old
One
,
commenced
smoking
at
a
great
rate
.
   
<EOS>
"
Beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
renewing
the
subject
,
and
addressing
Mr
Pickwick
,
after
a
considerable
pause
,
"
nothin'
personal
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
sir
;
<EOS>
I
hope
you
ha'n't
got
a

"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
I
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
laughing
;
and
while
Mr
Pickwick
laughed
,
Sam
Weller
informed
his
parent
in
a
whisper
,
of
the
relation
in
which
he
stood
towards
that
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Beg
your
pardon

"
said
Mr
Weller
,
senior
,
taking
off
his
hat
,
<EOS>

None

said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
glad
to
hear
it
<EOS>
,
sir

"
replied
the
old
man
;
"
I
took
a
good
deal
o
'
pains
with
his
eddication

sir

let
him
run
in
the

It

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rather
a

process

I
should

said
Mr

,
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
not
a
wery
sure
one

neither

added
Mr

;
"
I
got
reg'larly
done
the
other
day

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No

"
said
his
father
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
"
said
the
son
;
and
he
proceeded
to
relate
,
in
as
few
words
as
possible
,
how
he
had
fallen
a
ready
dupe
to
the
stratagems
of
Job
Trotter
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
,
senior
,
listened
to
the
tale
with
the
most
profound
attention
,
and
,
at
its
termination
,
said
---
   
"
<EOS>
Worn't

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
did
not
quite
understand
the
last
item
of
description
,
but
,
comprehending
the
first
,
said
"
<EOS>
Yes

"
at
a
venture

<EOS>
"
T

Yes

said
Mr

with
great
earnestness

<EOS>
"
Then
I

where
they

that

Mr

<EOS>
"
No

Mr

<EOS>
"
Fact

said
Mr

"
and
I
'll
tell

I

<EOS>
I
work
an
Ipswich
coach
now

then
for

<EOS>
I
worked
down
the

at
the
Black
Boy
at
Chelmsford

<EOS>
the
wery
place
they

come

I
took
'em
up
,
right
through
to
Ipswich
,
where
the
man
-
servant
---
him
in
the
mulberries

told
me
they

goin

put
up

a
long
time

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
follow
him
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
we
may
as
well
see
Ipswich
as
any
other
place

<EOS>
I
'll
follow
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
quite
certain
it
was
them
,
governor
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Weller
,
junior
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
,
Sammy
,
quite
,
"
replied
his
father
,
"
for
their
appearance
is
wery
sing'ler
;
besides
that
'
ere
,
I
wondered
to
see
the
gen'l'm'n
so
formiliar
with
his
servant
;
and
,
more
than
that
,
as
they
sat
in
the
front
,
right
behind
the
box
,
I
heerd
'em
laughing
and
saying
how
they
'd
done
old
Fireworks
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Old
who
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Old
Fireworks
,
Sir
;
by
which
,
I
've
no
doubt
,
they
meant
you
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
positively
vile
or
atrocious
in
the
appellation
of
"
old
Fireworks
,
"
but
still
it
is
by
no
means
a
respectful
or
flattering
designation
.
 
<EOS>
The
recollection
of
all
the
wrongs
he
had
sustained
at
Jingle
's
hands
,
had
crowded
on
Mr
Pickwick
's
mind
,
the
moment
Mr
Weller
began
to
speak
;
it
wanted
but
a
feather
to
turn
the
scale
,
and
"
old
Fireworks
"
did
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
follow
him
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
an
emphatic
blow
on
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
work
down
to
Ipswich
the
day
arter
to
-
morrow
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
the
elder
,
"
from
the
Bull
in
Whitechapel
;
and
if
you
really
mean
to
go
,
you
'd
better
go
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
we
had
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
very
true
;
I
can
write
to
Bury
,
and
tell
them
to
meet
me
at
Ipswich
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
go
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
hurry
away
,
Mr
Weller
;
wo
n't
you
take
anything
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
wery
good
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
W
,
stopping
short
;
---
"
perhaps
a
small
glass
of
brandy
to
drink
your
health
,
and
success
to
Sammy
,
Sir
,
would
n't
be
amiss
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
glass
of
brandy
here
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
brandy
was
brought
;
and
Mr
Weller
,
after
pulling
his
hair
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
nodding
to
Sam
,
jerked
it
down
his
capacious
throat
as
if
it
had
been
a
small
thimbleful
.
<EOS>
"
Well
done
,
father
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
take
care
,
old
fellow
,
or
you
'll
have
a
touch
of
your
old
complaint
,
the
gout
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
found
a
sov'rin
'
cure
for
that
,
Sammy
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
setting
down
the
glass
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
sovereign
cure
for
the
gout
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
hastily
producing
his
note
-
book
---
<EOS>
"
what
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
gout
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
,
"
the
gout
is
a
complaint
as
arises
from
too
much
ease
and
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
If
ever
you
're
attacked
with
the
gout
,
sir
,
jist
you
marry
a
widder
as
has
got
a
good
loud
woice
,
with
a
decent
notion
of
usin
'
it
,
and
you
'll
never
have
the
gout
agin
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
capital
prescription
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
takes
it
reg'lar
,
and
I
can
warrant
it
to
drive
away
any
illness
as
is
caused
by
too
much
jollity
.
"
 
<EOS>
Having
imparted
this
valuable
secret
,
Mr
Weller
drained
his
glass
once
more
,
produced
a
laboured
wink
,
sighed
deeply
,
and
slowly
retired
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
what
do
you
think
of
what
your
father
says
,
Sam
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
Think
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
"
replied
Mr
Weller
;
"
why
,
I
think
he
's
the
wictim
o
'
connubiality
,
as
Blue
Beard
's
domestic
chaplain
said
,
vith
a
tear
of
pity
,
ven
he
buried
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
replying
to
this
very
apposite
conclusion
,
and
,
therefore
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
after
settling
the
reckoning
,
resumed
his
walk
to
Gray
's
Inn
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
time
he
reached
its
secluded
groves
,
however
,
eight
o'clock
had
struck
,
and
the
unbroken
stream
of
gentlemen
in
muddy
high
-
lows
,
soiled
white
hats
,
and
rusty
apparel
,
who
were
pouring
towards
the
different
avenues
of
egress
,
warned
him
that
the
majority
of
the
offices
had
closed
for
that
day
.
   
<EOS>
After
climbing
two
pairs
of
steep
and
dirty
stairs
,
he
found
his
anticipations
were
realised
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Perker
's
"
outer
door
"
was
closed
;
and
the
dead
silence
which
followed
Mr
Weller
's
repeated
kicks
thereat
,
announced
that
the
officials
had
retired
from
business
for
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
pleasant
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
I
should
n't
lose
an
hour
in
seeing
him
;
I
shall
not
be
able
to
get
one
wink
of
sleep
to
-
night
,
I
know
,
unless
I
have
the
satisfaction
of
reflecting
that
I
have
confided
this
matter
to
a
professional
man
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
an
old
"
ooman
comin
'
<EOS>
upstairs
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
;
"
p'raps
<EOS>
she
knows
where
we
can
find
somebody
.
 
<EOS>
Hollo
,
old
lady
,
vere
's
Mr
Perker
's
people
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Perker
's
people
,
"
said
a
thin
,
miserable
-
looking
old
woman
,
stopping
to
recover
breath
after
the
ascent
of
the
staircase
---
"
Mr
Perker
's
people
's
gone
,
and
I
'm
a
-
goin
'
to
do
the
office
out
.
"
<EOS>
"
Are
you
Mr
Perker
's
servant
?
"
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
Mr
Perker
's
laundress
,
"
replied
the
woman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
half
aside
to
Sam
,
"
it
's
a
curious
circumstance
,
Sam
,
that
they
call
the
old
women
in
these
inns
,
laundresses
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
's
that
for
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
'Cos
they
has
a
mortal
awersion
to
washing
anythin
'
,
I
suppose
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
wonder
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
at
the
old
woman
,
whose
appearance
,
as
well
as
the
condition
of
the
office
,
which
she
had
by
this
time
opened
,
indicated
a
rooted
antipathy
to
the
application
of
soap
and
water
;
"
do
you
know
where
I
can
find
Mr
Perker
,
my
good
woman
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
n't
,
"
replied
the
old
woman
gruffly
;
"
he
's
out
o
'
town
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
unfortunate
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
<EOS>
"
where
's
his
clerk
?
<EOS>
Do
you
know
?
"
   
"
Yes
,
I
know
where
he
is
,
but
he
wo
n't
thank
me
for
telling
you
,
"
replied
the
laundress
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
very
particular
business
with
him
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
it
do
in
the
morning
?
"
said
the
woman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
so
well
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
"
if
it
was
anything
very
particular
,
I
was
to
say
where
he
was
,
<EOS>
so
I
suppose
there
's
no
harm
in
telling
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
just
go
to
the
Magpie
and
Stump
,
and
ask
at
the
bar
for
Mr
Lowten
,
they
'll
show
you
in
to
him
,
and
he
's
Mr
Perker
's
clerk
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
direction
,
and
having
been
furthermore
informed
that
the
hostelry
in
question
was
situated
in
a
court
,
happy
in
the
double
advantage
of
being
in
the
vicinity
of
Clare
Market
,
and
closely
approximating
to
the
back
of
New
Inn
,
Mr
Pickwick
and
Sam
descended
the
rickety
staircase
in
safety
,
and
issued
forth
in
quest
of
the
Magpie
and
Stump
.
   
<EOS>
This
favoured
tavern
,
sacred
to
the
evening
orgies
of
Mr
Lowten
and
his
companions
,
was
what
ordinary
people
would
designate
a
public
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
That
the
landlord
was
a
man
of
money
-
making
turn
was
sufficiently
testified
by
the
fact
of
a
small
bulkhead
beneath
the
tap
-
room
window
,
in
size
and
shape
not
unlike
a
sedan
-
chair
,
being
underlet
to
a
mender
of
shoes
:
and
that
he
was
a
being
of
a
philanthropic
mind
was
evident
from
the
protection
he
afforded
to
a
pieman
,
who
vended
his
delicacies
without
fear
of
interruption
,
on
the
very
door
-
step
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
lower
windows
,
which
were
decorated
with
curtains
of
a
saffron
hue
,
dangled
two
or
three
printed
cards
,
bearing
reference
to
Devonshire
cider
and
Dantzic
spruce
,
while
a
large
blackboard
,
announcing
in
white
letters
to
an
enlightened
public
,
that
there
were
500,000
barrels
of
double
stout
in
the
cellars
of
the
establishment
,
left
the
mind
in
a
state
of
not
unpleasing
doubt
and
uncertainty
as
to
the
precise
direction
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
,
in
which
this
mighty
cavern
might
be
supposed
to
extend
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
add
that
the
weather
-
beaten
signboard
bore
the
half
-
obliterated
semblance
of
a
magpie
intently
eyeing
a
crooked
streak
of
brown
paint
,
which
the
neighbours
had
been
taught
from
infancy
to
consider
as
the
"
stump
,
"
we
have
said
all
that
need
be
said
of
the
exterior
of
the
edifice
.
   
<EOS>
On
Mr
Pickwick
's
presenting
himself
at
the
bar
,
an
elderly
female
emerged
from
behind
the
screen
therein
,
and
presented
herself
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr
Lowten
here
,
ma'am
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
is
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
landlady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
Charley
,
show
the
gentleman
in
to
Mr
Lowten
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
gen'l'm'n
ca
n't
go
in
just
now
,
"
said
a
shambling
pot
-
boy
,
with
a
red
head
,
"
cos
"
<EOS>
Mr
Lowten
's
a
-
singin
'
a
comic
song
,
and
he
'll
put
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
'll
be
done
directly
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
red
-
headed
pot
-
boy
had
scarcely
finished
speaking
,
when
a
most
unanimous
hammering
of
tables
,
and
jingling
of
glasses
,
announced
that
the
song
had
that
instant
terminated
;
and
Mr
Pickwick
,
after
desiring
Sam
to
solace
himself
in
the
tap
,
suffered
himself
to
be
conducted
into
the
presence
of
Mr
Lowten
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
announcement
of
"
A
gentleman
to
speak
to
you
,
Sir
,
"
a
puffy
-
faced
young
man
,
who
filled
the
chair
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
looked
with
some
surprise
in
the
direction
from
whence
the
voice
proceeded
;
and
the
surprise
seemed
to
be
by
no
means
diminished
,
when
his
eyes
rested
on
an
individual
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
and
I
am
very
sorry
to
disturb
the
other
gentlemen
,
too
,
<EOS>
but
I
come
on
very
particular
business
;
and
if
you
will
suffer
me
to
detain
you
at

end
of

for
five
minutes
,
I
shall
be
very
much
obliged
to
you

"
   
<EOS>
The
puffy
-
faced
young
man
rose
,
and
drawing
a
chair
close
to
Mr
Pickwick
in
an
obscure
corner
of
the
room
,
listened
attentively
to
his
tale
of
woe
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
he
said
,
when
Mr
Pickwick
had
concluded
,
"
Dodson
and
Fogg
---
sharp
practice
theirs
---
capital
men
of
business
,
Dodson
and
Fogg
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
admitted
the
sharp
practice
of
Dodson
and
Fogg
,
and
Lowten
resumed
.
<EOS>
"
Perker
ai
n't
in
town
,
and
he
wo
n't
be
,
neither
,
before
the
end
of
next
week
;
but
if
you
want
the
action
defended
,
and
will
leave
the
copy
with
me
,
I
can
do
all
that
's
needful
till
he
comes
back
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
exactly
what
I
came
here
for
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
handing
over
the
document
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
anything
particular
occurs
,
you
can
write
to
me
at
the
post
-
office
,
Ipswich
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
right
,
"
replied
Mr
Perker
's
clerk
;
and
then
seeing
Mr
Pickwick
's
eye
wandering
curiously
towards
the
table
,
he
added
,
"
will
you
join
us
,
for
half
an
hour
or
so
?
 
<EOS>
We
are
capital
company
here
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
Samkin
and
Green
's
managing
-
clerk
,
and
Smithers
and
Price
's
chancery
,
and
Pimkin
and
Thomas
's
out
o
'
doors
---
sings
a
capital
song
,
he
does
---
and
Jack
Bamber
,
and
ever
so
many
more
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
come
out
of
the
country
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
like
to
join
us
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
could
not
resist
so
tempting
an
opportunity
of
studying
human
nature
.
 
<EOS>
He
suffered
himself
to
be
led
to
the
table
,
where
,
after
having
been
introduced
to
the
company
in
due
form
,
he
was
accommodated
with
a
seat
near
the
chairman
and
called
for
a
glass
of
his
favourite
beverage
.
   
<EOS>
A
profound
silence
,
quite
contrary
to
Mr
Pickwick
's
expectation
,
succeeded
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
find
this
sort
of
thing
disagreeable
,
I
hope
,
sir
?
"
said
his
right
hand
neighbour
,
a
gentleman
in
a
checked
shirt
and
Mosaic
studs
,
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
in
the
least
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
I
like
it
very
much
,
although
I
am
no
smoker
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
say
I
was
n't
,
"
interposed
another
gentleman
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
board
and
lodgings
to
me
,
is
smoke
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
glanced
at
the
speaker
,
and
thought
that
if
it
were
washing
too
,
it
would
be
all
the
better
.
   
<EOS>
Here
there
was
another
pause
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
a
stranger
,
and
his
coming
had
evidently
cast
a
damp
upon
the
party
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Grundy
's
going
to
oblige
the
company
with
a
song
,
"
said
the
chairman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
he
ai
n't
,
"
said
Mr
Grundy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
said
the
chairman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Because
he
ca
n't
,
"
said
Mr
Grundy
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
say
he
wo
n't
,
"
replied
the
chairman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
he
wo
n't
,
"
retorted
Mr
Grundy
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Grundy
's
positive
refusal
to
gratify
the
company
occasioned
another
silence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wo
n't
anybody
enliven
us
?
"
said
the
chairman
,
despondingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
enliven
us
yourself
,
Mr
Chairman
?
"
said
a
young
man
with
a
whisker
,
a
squint
,
and
an
open
shirt
collar
(
dirty
)
,
from
the
bottom
of
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hear
!
<EOS>
hear
!
"
said
the
smoking
gentleman
,
in
the
Mosaic
jewellery
.
   
<EOS>
"
Because
I
only
know
one
song
,
and
I
have
sung
it
already
,
and
it
's
a
fine
of
"
glasses
round
"
to
sing
the
same
song
twice
in
a
night
,
"
replied
the
chairman
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
an
unanswerable
reply
,
and
silence
prevailed
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
to
-
night
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
hoping
to
start
a
subject
which
all
the
company
could
take
a
part
in
discussing
,
"
I
have
been
to
-
night
,
in
a
place
which
you
all
know
very
well
,
doubtless
,
but
which
I
have
not
been
in
for
some
years
,
and
know
very
little
of
;
I
mean
Gray
's
Inn
,
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
Curious
little
nooks
in
a
great
place
,
like
London
,
these
old
inns
are
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
Jove
!
"
said
the
chairman
,
whispering
across
the
table
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
you
have
hit
upon
something
that
one
of
us
,
at
least
,
would
talk
upon
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
draw
old
Jack
Bamber
out
;
he
was
never
heard
to
talk
about
anything
else
but
the
inns
,
and
he
has
lived
alone
in
them
till
he
's
half
crazy
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
individual
to
whom
Lowten
alluded
,
was
a
little
,
yellow
,
high
-
shouldered
man
,
whose
countenance
,
from
his
habit
of
stooping
forward
when
silent
,
Mr
Pickwick
had
not
observed
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
wondered
,
though
,
when
the
old
man
raised
his
shrivelled
face
,
and
bent
his
gray
eye
upon
him
,
with
a
keen
inquiring
look
,
that
such
remarkable
features
could
have
escaped
his
attention
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
fixed
grim
smile
perpetually
on
his
countenance
;
he
leaned
his
chin
on
a
long
,
skinny
hand
,
with
nails
of
extraordinary
length
;
and
as
he
inclined
his
head
to
one
side
,
and
looked
keenly
out
from
beneath
his
ragged
gray
eyebrows
,
there
was
a
strange
,
wild
slyness
in
his
leer
,
quite
repulsive
to
behold
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
the
figure
that
now
started
forward
,
and
burst
into
an
animated
torrent
of
words
.
 
<EOS>
As
this
chapter
has
been
a
long
one
,
however
,
and
as
the
old
man
was
a
remarkable
personage
,
it
will
be
more
respectful
to
him
,
and
more
convenient
to
us
,
to
let
him
speak
for
himself
in
a
fresh
one
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
21
.
<EOS>
In
which
the
old
man
launches
forth
into
his
favourite
theme
,
and
relates
a
story
about
a
queer
client
 
Aha
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
old
man
,
a
brief
description
of
whose
manner
and
appearance
concluded
the
last
chapter
,
"
<EOS>
aha
!
<EOS>
who
was
talking
about
the
inns
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
---
"
I
was
observing
what
singular
old
places
they
are
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
YOU
!
"
said
the
old
man
contemptuously
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
YOU
know
of
the
time
when
young
men
shut
themselves
up
in
those
lonely
rooms
,
and
read
and
read
,
hour
after
hour
,
and
night
after
night
,
till
their
reason
wandered
beneath
their
midnight
studies
;
till
their
mental
powers
were
exhausted
;
till
morning
's
light
brought
no
freshness
or
health
to
them
;
and
they
sank
beneath
the
unnatural
devotion
of
their
youthful
energies
to
their
dry
old
books
?
 
<EOS>
Coming
down
to
a
later
time
,
and
a
very
different
day
,
what
do
YOU
know
of
the
gradual
sinking
beneath
consumption
,
or
the
quick
wasting
of
fever
---
the
grand
results
of
"
life
"
and
dissipation
---
which
men
have
undergone
in
these
same
rooms
?
 
<EOS>
How
many
vain
pleaders
for
mercy
,
do
you
think
,
have
turned
away
heart
-
sick
from
the
lawyer
's
office
,
to
find
a
resting
-
place
in
the
Thames
,
or
a
refuge
in
the
jail
?
 
<EOS>
They
are
no
ordinary
houses
,
those
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
panel
in
the
old
wainscotting
,
but
what
,
if
it
were
endowed
with
the
powers
of
speech
and
memory
,
could
start
from
the
wall
,
and
tell
its
tale
of
horror
---
the
romance
of
life
,
Sir
,
the
romance
of
life
!
 
<EOS>
Common
-
place
as
they
may
seem
now
<EOS>
,
I
tell
you
they
are
strange
old
places
,
and
I
would
rather
hear
many
a
legend
with
a
terrific
-
sounding
name
,
than
the
true
history
of
one
old
set
of
chambers
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
odd
in
the
old
man
's
sudden
energy
,
and
the
subject
which
had
called
it
forth
,
that
Mr
Pickwick
was
prepared
with
no
observation
in
reply
;
and
the
old
man
checking
his
impetuosity
,
and
resuming
the
leer
,
which
had
disappeared
during
his
previous
excitement
,
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
Look
at
them
in
another
light
---
their
most
common
-
place
and
least
romantic
.
 
<EOS>
What
fine
places
of
slow
torture
they
are
!
 
<EOS>
Think
of
the
needy
man
who
has
spent
his
all
,
beggared
himself
,
and
pinched
his
friends
,
to
enter
the
profession
,
which
is
destined
never
to
yield
him
a
morsel
of
bread
.
 
<EOS>
The
waiting
---
the
hope
---
the
disappointment
---
the
fear
---
the
misery
---
the
poverty
---
the
blight
on
his
hopes
,
and
end
to
his
career
---
the
suicide
perhaps
,
or
the
shabby
,
slipshod
drunkard
.
 
<EOS>
Am
I
not
right
about
them
?
"
<EOS>
And
the
old
man
rubbed
his
hands
,
and
leered
as
if
in
delight
at
having
found
another
point
of
view
in
which
to
place
his
favourite
subject
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
eyed
the
old
man
with
great
curiosity
,
and
the
remainder
of
the
company
smiled
,
and
looked
on
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Talk
of
your
German
universities
,
"
said
the
little
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pooh
,
pooh
!
<EOS>
there
's
romance
enough
at
home
without
going
half
a
mile
for
it
;
only
people
never
think
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
thought
of
the
romance
of
this
particular
subject
before
,
certainly
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
you
did
n't
,
"
said
the
little
old
man
;
"
of
course
not
.
<EOS>
As
a
friend
of
mine
used
to
say
to
me
,
"
What
is
there
in
chambers
in
particular
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Queer
old
places
,
"
said
I.
 
"
Not
at
all
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lonely
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
He
died
one
morning
of
apoplexy
,
as
he
was
going
to
open
his
outer
door
.
 
<EOS>
Fell
with
his
head
in
his
own
letter
-
box
,
and
there
he
lay
for
eighteen
months
.
<EOS>
Everybody
thought
he
'd
gone
out
of
town
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
was
he
found
out
at
last
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
benchers
determined
to
have
his
door
broken
open
,
as
he
had
n't
paid
any
rent
for
two
years
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
did
.
 
<EOS>
Forced
the
lock
;
and
a
very
dusty
skeleton
in
a
blue
coat
,
black
knee
-
shorts
,
and
silks
,
fell
forward
in
the
arms
of
the
porter
who
opened
the
door
.
<EOS>
Queer
,
that
.
 
<EOS>
Rather
,
perhaps
;
rather
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
The
little
old
man
put
his
head
more
on
one
side
,
and
rubbed
his
hands
with
unspeakable
glee
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
another
case
,
"
said
the
little
old
man
,
when
his
chuckles
had
in
some
degree
subsided
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
occurred
in
Clifford
's
Inn
.
<EOS>
Tenant
of
a
top
set
---
bad
character
---
shut
himself
up
in
his
bedroom
closet
,
and
took
a
dose
of
arsenic
.
 
<EOS>
The
steward
thought
he
had
run
away
:
opened
the
door
,
and
put
a
bill
up
.
 
<EOS>
Another
man
came
,
took
the
chambers
,
furnished
them
,
and
went
to
live
there
.
 
<EOS>
Somehow
or
other
<EOS>
he
could
n't
sleep
---
always
restless
and
uncomfortable
.
 
<EOS>
"
Odd
,
"
says
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
make
the
other
room
my
bedchamber
,
and
this
my
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
made
the
change
,
and
slept
very
well
at
night
,
but
suddenly
found
that
,
somehow
,
he
could
n't
read
in
the
evening
:
he
got
nervous
and
uncomfortable
,
and
used
to
be
always
snuffing
his
candles
and
staring
about
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
make
this
out
,
"
said
he
,
when
he
came
home
from
the
play
one
night
,
and
was
drinking
a
glass
of
cold
grog
,
with
his
back
to
the
wall
,
<EOS>
in
order
that
he
might
n't
be
able
to
fancy
there
was
any
one
behind
him
---
"
I
ca
n't
make
it
out
,
"
said
he
;
and
just
then
his
eyes
rested
on
the
little
closet
that
had
been
always
locked
up
,
and
a
shudder
ran
through
his
whole
frame
from
top
to
toe
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
felt
this
strange
feeling
before
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
can
not
help
thinking
there
's
something
wrong
about
that
closet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
made
a
strong
effort
,
plucked
up
his
courage
,
shivered
the
lock
with
a
blow
or
two
of
the
poker
,
opened
the
door
,
and
there
,
sure
enough
,
standing
bolt
upright
in
the
corner
,
was
the
last
tenant
,
with
a
little
bottle
clasped
firmly
in
his
hand
,
and
his
face
---
well
!
"
<EOS>
As
the
little
old
man
concluded
,
he
looked
round
on
the
attentive
faces
of
his
wondering
auditory
with
a
smile
of
grim
delight
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
strange
things
these
are
you
tell
us
of
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
minutely
scanning
the
old
man
's
countenance
,
by
the
aid
of
his
glasses
.
   
<EOS>
"
Strange
!
"
said
the
little

Nonsense
;
you
think
them
strange
,
because
you
know
nothing
about
it

They
are
funny
,
but
not
uncommon

Funny

"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
involuntarily
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
funny
,
are
they
not
?
<EOS>
"
replied
the
little
old
man
,
with
a
diabolical
leer
;
and
then
,
without
pausing
for
an
answer
,
he
continued
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
knew
another
man
---
let
me
see
---
forty
years
ago
now
---
who
took
an
old
,
damp
,
rotten
set
of
chambers
,
in
one
of
the
most
ancient
inns
,
that
had
been
shut
up
and
empty
for
years
and
years
before
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
lots
of
old
women
's
stories
about
the
place
,
and
it
certainly
was
very
far
from
being
a
cheerful
one
;
but
he
was
poor
,
and
the
rooms
were
cheap
,
and
that
would
have
been
quite
a
sufficient
reason
for
him
,
if
they
had
been
ten
times
worse
than
they
really
were
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
obliged
to
take
some
mouldering
fixtures
that
were
on
the
place
,
and
,
among
the
rest
,
was
a
great
lumbering
wooden
press
for
papers
,
with
large
glass
doors
,
and
a
green
curtain
inside
;
a
pretty
useless
thing
for
him
,
for
he
had
no
papers
to
put
in
it
;
and
as
to
his
clothes
,
he
carried
them
about
with
him
,
and
that
was
n't
very
hard
work
,
either
.
<EOS>
Well
,
he
had
moved
in
all
his
furniture
---
it
was
n't
quite
a
truck
-
full
 
---
and
had
sprinkled
it
about
the
room
,
so
as
to
make
the
four
chairs
look
as
much
like
a
dozen
as
possible
,
and
was
sitting
down
before
the
fire
at
night
,
drinking
the
first
glass
of
two
gallons
of
whisky
he
had
ordered
on
credit
,
wondering
whether
it
would
ever
be
paid
for
,
and
if
so
,
in
how
many
years
<EOS>
"
time
,
when
his
eyes
encountered
the
glass
doors
of
the
wooden
press
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
says
he
,
"
if
I
had
n't
been
obliged
to
take
that
ugly
article
at
the
old
broker
's
valuation
,
I
might
have
got
something
comfortable
for
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
,
old
fellow
,
"
he
said
,
speaking
aloud
to
the
press
,
having
nothing
else
to
speak
to
,
"
if
it
would
n't
cost
more
to
break
up
your
old
carcass
,
than
it
would
ever
be
worth
afterward
,
I
'd
have
a
fire
out
of
you
in
less
than
no
time
.
"
<EOS>
He
had
hardly
spoken
the
words
,
when
a
sound
resembling
a
faint
groan
,
appeared
to
issue
from
the
interior
of
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
It
startled
him
at
first
,
but
thinking
,
on
a
moment
's
reflection
,
that
it
must
be
some
young
fellow
in
the
next
chamber
,
who
had
been
dining
out
,
he
put
his
feet
on
the
fender
,
and
raised
the
poker
to
stir
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
moment
,
the
sound
was
repeated
;
and
one
of
the
glass
doors
slowly
opening
,
disclosed
a
pale
and
emaciated
figure
in
soiled
and
worn
apparel
,
standing
erect
in
the
press
.
 
<EOS>
The
figure
was
tall
and
thin
,
and
the
countenance
expressive
of
care
and
anxiety
;
but
there
was
something
in
the
hue
of
the
skin
,
and
gaunt
and
unearthly
appearance
of
the
whole
form
,
which
no
being
of
this
world
was
ever
seen
to
wear
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
?
"
said
the
new
tenant
,
turning
very
pale
;
poising
the
poker
in
his
hand
,
however
,
and
taking
a
very
decent
aim
at
the
countenance
of
the
figure
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
throw
that
poker
at
me
,
"
replied
the
form
;
"
if
you
hurled
it
with
ever
so
sure
an
aim
,
it
would
pass
through
me
,
without
resistance
,
and
expend
its
force
on
the
wood
behind
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
spirit
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
And
pray
,
what
do
you
want
here
?
"
faltered
the
tenant
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
this
room
,
"
replied
the
apparition
,
"
my
worldly
ruin
was
worked
,
and
I
and
my
children
beggared
.
<EOS>
In
this
press
,
the
papers
in
a
long
,
long
suit
,
which
accumulated
for
years
,
were
deposited
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
room
,
when
I
had
died
of
grief
,
and
long
-
deferred
hope
,
two
wily
harpies
divided
the
wealth
for
which
I
had
contested
during
a
wretched
existence
,
and
of
which
,
at
last
,
not
one
farthing
was
left
for
my
unhappy
descendants
.
 
<EOS>
I
terrified
them
from
the
spot
,
and
since
that
day
have
prowled
by
night
---
the
only
period
at
which
I
can
revisit
the
earth
---
about
the
scenes
of
my
long
-
protracted
misery
.
 
<EOS>
This
apartment
is
mine
:
leave
it
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
insist
upon
making
your
appearance
here
,
"
said
the
tenant
,
who
had
had
time
to
collect
his
presence
of
mind
during
this
prosy
statement
of
the
ghost
's
,
"
I
shall
give
up
possession
with
the
greatest
pleasure
;
but
I
should
like
to
ask
you
one
question
,
if
you
will
allow
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Say
on
,
"
said
the
apparition
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
the
tenant
,
"
I
do
n't
apply
the
observation
personally
to
you
,
because
it
is
equally
applicable
to
most
of
the
ghosts
I
ever
heard
of
;
but
it
does
appear
to
me
somewhat
inconsistent
,
that
when
you
have
an
opportunity
of
visiting
the
fairest
spots
of
earth
---
for
I
suppose
space
is
nothing
to
you
---
you
should
always
return
exactly
to
the
very
places
where
you
have
been
most
miserable
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Egad
,
that
's
very
true
;
I
never
thought
of
that
before
,
"
said
the
ghost
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Sir
,
"
pursued
the
tenant
,
"
this
is
a
very
uncomfortable
room
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
appearance
of
that
press
,
I
should
be
disposed
to
say
that
it
is
not
wholly
free
from
bugs
;
and
I
really
think
you
might
find
much
more
comfortable
quarters
:
to
say
nothing
of
the
climate
of
London
,
which
is
extremely
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
right
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
ghost
politely
,
"
it
never
struck
me
till
now
;
I
'll
try
change
of
air
directly
"
---
and
,
in
fact
,
he
began
to
vanish
as
he
spoke
;
his
legs
,
indeed
,
had
quite
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
if
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
tenant
,
calling
after
him
,
"
if
you
WOULD
have
the
goodness
to
suggest
to
the
other
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
are
now
engaged
in
haunting
old
empty
houses
,
that
they
might
be
much
more
comfortable
elsewhere
,
you
will
confer
a
very
great
benefit
on
society

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will

"
replied
the
ghost
;
"
we
must
be
dull

very
dull
fellows

indeed

I
ca
n't
imagine
how
we
can
have

so
stupid

"
 
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
the
spirit
disappeared
;
and
what
is
rather
remarkable
,
"
added
the
old
man
,
with
a
shrewd
look
round
the
table
,
"
he
never
came
back
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That

said
the
man
in
the
Mosaic
studs
,
lighting
a
fresh
cigar
.
   
<EOS>
"
IF
!

"
exclaimed
the
old
man
,
with
a
look
of
excessive
contempt
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
Lowten
,
"
he
'll
say
next
,
that
my
story
about
the
queer
client
we
had
,
when
I
was
in
an
attorney
's
office
,
is
not
true
either

I
should
n't
wonder
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
sha
n't
venture
to
say
anything
at
all
about
it
,
seeing
that
I
never
heard
the
story
,
"
observed
the
owner
of
the
Mosaic
decorations
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
repeat
it
,
Sir

Mr

Ah

said
Lowten
,
"
nobody

heard
it

me

I

nearly
forgotten
it

<EOS>
The
old
man
looked
round
the
table
,
and
leered
more
horribly
than
ever
,
as
if
in
triumph
,
at
the
attention
which
was
depicted
in
every
face
.
 
<EOS>
Then
rubbing
his
chin
with
his
hand
,
and
looking
up
to
the
ceiling
as
if
to
recall
the
circumstances
to
his
memory
,
he
began
as
follows
:

"
It
matters
little

said
the
old
man
,
"
where
,
or
how
,
I
picked
up
this
brief
history

If
I
were
to
relate
it

the
order

it
reached

I

commence

when
I
had
arrived
at

conclusion

go
back

It
is
enough
for
me
to
say
that
some
of
its

passed
before

this

The

to
hang
about

<EOS>
Many

have
long

been
closed

have
looked
round
upon

lightly
enough

entering

remembers

freely
made

hope

happy

it

How
soon
have
those

deeply
sunken
in
the

glared
from
faces
wasted
with
famine

sallow
from
confinement

"
Twenty
years
ago
,
that
pavement
was
worn
with
the
footsteps
of
a
mother
and
child
,
who
,
day
by
day
,
so
surely
as
the
morning
came
,
presented
themselves
at
the
prison
gate
;
often
after
a
night
of
restless
misery
and
anxious
thoughts
,
were
they
there
,
a
full
hour
too
soon
,
and
then
the
young
mother
turning
meekly
away
,
would
lead
the
child
to
the
old
bridge
,
and
raising
him
in
her
arms
to
show
him
the
glistening
water
,
tinted
with
the
light
of
the
morning
's
sun
,
and
stirring
with
all
the
bustling
preparations
for
business
and
pleasure
that
the
river
presented
at
that
early
hour
,
endeavour
to
interest
his
thoughts
in
the
objects
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
would
quickly
set
him
down
,
and
hiding
her
face
in
her
shawl
,
give
vent
to
the
tears
that
blinded
her
;
for
no
expression
of
interest
or
amusement
lighted
up
his
thin
and
sickly
face
.
 
<EOS>
His
recollections
were
few
enough
,
but
they
were
all
of
one
kind
---
all
connected
with
the
poverty
and
misery
of
his
parents
.
 
<EOS>
Hour
after
hour
had
he
sat
on
his
mother
's
knee
,
and
with
childish
sympathy
watched
the
tears
that
stole
down
her
face
,
and
then
crept
quietly
away
into
some
dark
corner
,
and
sobbed
himself
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
The
hard
realities
of
the
world
,
with
many
of
its
worst
privations
---
hunger
and
thirst
,
and
cold
and
want
---
had
all
come
home
to
him
,
from
the
first
dawnings
of
reason
;
and
though
the
form
of
childhood
was
there
,
its
light
heart
,
its
merry
laugh
,
and
sparkling
eyes
were
wanting
.

<EOS>
The
father
and
mother
looked
on
upon
this
,
and
upon
each
other
,
with
thoughts
of
agony
they
dared
not
breathe
in
words

The
healthy
,
strong

man

who
could
have
borne
almost
any
fatigue

active

wasting
beneath
the
close
confinement
and
unhealthy
atmosphere
of
a
crowded

change
had
been
rendered
necessary
by
their
increasing
poverty
,
she
was
happier
now
,
for
she
was
nearer
him
.
 
<EOS>
For
two
months
,
she
and
her
little
companion
watched
the
opening
of
the
gate
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
One
day
she
failed
to
come
,
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
Another
morning
arrived
,
and
she
came
alone
.
 
<EOS>
The
child
was
dead
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
They
little
know
,
who
coldly
talk
of
the
poor
man
's
bereavements
,
as
a
happy
release
from
pain
to
the
departed
,
and
a
merciful
relief
from
expense
to
the
survivor
<EOS>
---
they
little
know
,
I
say
,
what
the
agony
of
those
bereavements
is
.
 
<EOS>
A
silent
look
of
affection
and
regard
when
all
other
eyes
are
turned
coldly
away
 
---
the
consciousness
that
we
possess
the
sympathy
and
affection
of
one
being
when
all
others
have
deserted
us
---
is
a
hold
,
a
stay
,
a
comfort
,
in
the
deepest
affliction
,
which
no
wealth
could
purchase
,
or
power
bestow
.
 
<EOS>
The
child
had
sat
at
his
parents
"
feet
for
hours
together
,
with
his
little
hands
patiently
folded
in
each
other
,
and
his
thin
wan
face
raised
towards
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
seen
him
pine
away
,
from
day
to
day
;
and
though
his
brief
existence
had
been
a
joyless
one
,
and
he
was
now
removed
to
that
peace
and
rest
which
,
child
as
he
was
,
he
had
never
known
in
this
world
,
they
were
his
parents
,
and
his
loss
sank
deep
into
their
souls
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
plain
to
those
who
looked
upon
the
mother
's
altered
face
,
that
death
must
soon
close
the
scene
of
her
adversity
and
trial
.
 
<EOS>
Her
husband
's
fellow
-
prisoners
shrank
from
obtruding
on
his
grief
and
misery
,
and
left
to
himself
alone
,
the
small
room
he
had
previously
occupied
in
common
with
two
companions
.
 
<EOS>
She
shared
it
with
him
;
and
lingering
on
without
pain
,
but
without
hope
,
her
life
ebbed
slowly
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
had
fainted
one
evening
in
her
husband
's
arms
,
and
he
had
borne
her
to
the
open
window
,
to
revive
her
with
the
air
,
when
the
light
of
the
moon
falling
full
upon
her
face
,
showed
him
a
change
upon
her
features
,
which
made
him
stagger
beneath
her
weight
,
like
a
helpless
infant
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Set
me
down
,
George
,
"
she
said
faintly
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
so
,
and
seating
himself
beside
her
,
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
,
and
burst
into
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
It
is
very
hard
to
leave
you
,
George
,
"
she
said
;
"
but
it
is
God
's
will
,
and
you
must
bear
it
for
my
sake
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
I
thank
Him
for
having
taken
our
boy
!
 
<EOS>
He
is
happy
,
and
in
heaven
now
.
<EOS>
What
would
he
have
done
here
,
without
his
mother
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
You
shall
not
die
,
Mary
,
you
shall
not
die
;
"
said
the
husband
,
starting
up
.
 
<EOS>
He
paced
hurriedly
to
and
fro
,
striking
his
head
with
his
clenched
fists
;
then
reseating
himself
beside
her
,
and
supporting
her
in
his
arms
,
added
more
calmly
,
"
Rouse
yourself
,
my
dear
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
pray
do
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
revive
yet
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
"
Never
again
,
George
;
never
again
,
"
said
the
dying
woman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
them
lay
me
by
my
poor
boy
now
,
but
promise
me
,
that
if
ever
you
leave
this
dreadful
place
,
and
should
grow
rich
,
you
will
have
us
removed
to
some
quiet
country
churchyard
,
a
long
,
long
way
off
---
very
far
from
here
---
where
we
can
rest
in
peace
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
George
,
promise
me
you
will
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
do
,
I
do
,
"
said
the
man
,
throwing
himself
passionately
on
his
knees
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
to
me
,
Mary
,
another
word
;
one
look
---
but
one
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
ceased
to
speak
:
for
the
arm
that
clasped
his
neck
grew
stiff
and
heavy
.
 
<EOS>
A
deep
sigh
escaped
from
the
wasted
form
before
him
;
the
lips
moved
,
and
a
smile
played
upon
the
face
;
but
the
lips
were
pallid
,
and
the
smile
faded
into
a
rigid
and
ghastly
stare
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
alone
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
night
,
in
the
silence
and
desolation
of
his
miserable
room
,
the
wretched
man
knelt
down
by
the
dead
body
of
his
wife
,
and
called
on
God
to
witness
a
terrible
oath
,
that
from
that
hour
,
he
devoted
himself
to
revenge
her
death
and
that
of
his
child
;
that
thenceforth
to
the
last
moment
of
his
life
,
his
whole
energies
should
be
directed
to
this
one
object
;
that
his
revenge
should
be
protracted
and
terrible
;
that
his
hatred
should
be
undying
and
inextinguishable
;
and
should
hunt
its
object
through
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
deepest
despair
,
and
passion
scarcely
human
,
had
made
such
fierce
ravages
on
his
face
and
form
,
in
that
one
night
,
that
his
companions
in
misfortune
shrank
affrighted
from
him
as
he
passed
by
.
 
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
heavy
,
his
face
a
deadly
white
,
and
his
body
bent
as
if
with
age
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
bitten
his
under
lip
nearly
through
in
the
violence
of
his
mental
suffering
,
and
the
blood
which
had
flowed
from
the
wound
had
trickled
down
his
chin
,
and
stained
his
shirt
and
neckerchief
.
 
<EOS>
No
tear
,
or
sound
of
complaint
escaped
him
;
but
the
unsettled
look
,
and
disordered
haste
with
which
he
paced
up
and
down
the
yard
,
denoted
the
fever
which
was
burning
within
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
necessary
that
his
wife
's
body
should
be
removed
from
the
prison
,
without
delay
.
 
<EOS>
He
received
the
communication
with
perfect
calmness
,
and
acquiesced
in
its
propriety
.
 
<EOS>
Nearly
all
the
inmates
of
the
prison
had
assembled
to
witness
its
removal
;
they
fell
back
on
either
side
when
the
widower
appeared
;
he
walked
hurriedly
forward
,
and
stationed
himself
,
alone
,
in
a
little
railed
area
close
to
the
lodge
gate
,
from
whence
the
crowd
,
with
an
instinctive
feeling
of
delicacy
,
had
retired
.
 
<EOS>
The
rude
coffin
was
borne
slowly
forward
on
men
's
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
A
dead
silence
pervaded
the
throng
,
broken
only
by
the
audible
lamentations
of
the
women
,
and
the
shuffling
steps
of
the
bearers
on
the
stone
pavement
.
<EOS>
They
reached
the
spot
where
the
bereaved
husband
stood
:
and
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
He
laid
his
hand
upon
the
coffin
,
and
mechanically
adjusting
the
pall
with
which
it
was
covered
,
motioned
them
onward
.
 
<EOS>
The
turnkeys
in
the
prison
lobby
took
off
their
hats
as
it
passed
through
,
and
in
another
moment
the
heavy
gate
closed
behind
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
vacantly
upon
the
crowd
,
and
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
Although
for
many
weeks
after
this
,
he
was
watched
,
night
and
day
,
in
the
wildest
ravings
of
fever
,
neither
the
consciousness
of
his
loss
,
nor
the
recollection
of
the
vow
he
had
made
,
ever
left
him
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Scenes
changed
before
his
eyes
,
place
succeeded
place
,
and
event
followed
event
,
in
all
the
hurry
of
delirium
;
but
they
were
all
connected
in
some
way
with
the
great
object
of
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
sailing
over
a
boundless
expanse
of
sea
,
with
a
blood
-
red
sky
above
,
and
the
angry
waters
,
lashed
into
fury
beneath
,
boiling
and
eddying
up
,
on
every
side
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
another
vessel
before
them
,
toiling
and
labouring
in
the
howling
storm
;
her
canvas
fluttering
in
ribbons
from
the
mast
,
and
her
deck
thronged
with
figures
who
were
lashed
to
the
sides
,
over
which
huge
waves
<EOS>
every
instant
burst
,
sweeping
away
some
devoted
creatures
into
the
foaming
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Onward
they
bore
,
amidst
the
roaring
mass
of
water
,
with
a
speed
and
force
which
nothing
could
resist
;
and
striking
the
stem
of
the
foremost
vessel
,
crushed
her
beneath
their
keel
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
huge
whirlpool
which
the
sinking
wreck
occasioned
,
arose
a
shriek
so
loud
and
shrill
---
<EOS>
the
death
-
cry
of
a
hundred
drowning
creatures
,
blended
into
one
fierce
yell
---
that
it
rung
far
above
the
war
-
cry
of
the
elements
,
and
echoed
,
and
re
-
echoed
till
it
seemed
to
pierce
air
,
sky
,
and
ocean
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
was
that
---
that
old
gray
head
that
rose
above
the
water
's
surface
,
and
with
looks
of
agony
,
and
screams
for
aid
,
<EOS>
buffeted
with
the
waves
!
 
<EOS>
One
look
,
and
he
had
sprung
from
the
vessel
's
side
,
and
with
vigorous
strokes
was
swimming
towards
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
reached
it
;
he
was
close
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
HIS
features
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
saw
him
coming
,
and
vainly
strove
to
elude
his
grasp
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
clasped
him
tight
,
and
dragged
him
beneath
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
Down
,
down
with
him
,
fifty
fathoms
down
;
his
struggles
grew
fainter
and
fainter
,
until
they
wholly
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dead
;
he
had
killed
him
,
and
had
kept
his
oath
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
traversing
the
scorching
sands
of
a
mighty
desert
,
barefoot
and
alone
.
 
<EOS>
The
sand
choked
and
blinded
him
;
its
fine
thin
grains
entered
the
very
pores
of
his
skin
,
and
irritated
him
almost
to
madness
.
 
<EOS>
Gigantic
masses
of
the
same
material
,
carried
forward
by
the
wind
,
and
shone
through
by
the
burning
sun
,
stalked
in
the
distance
like
pillars
of
living
fire
.
 
<EOS>
The
bones
of
men
,
who
had
perished
in
the
dreary
waste
,
lay
scattered
at
his
feet
;
a
fearful
light
fell
on
everything
around
;
so
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
,
nothing
but
objects
of
dread
and
horror
presented
themselves
.
<EOS>
Vainly
striving
to
utter
a
cry
of
terror
,
with
his
tongue
cleaving
to
his
mouth
,
he
rushed
madly
forward
.
 
<EOS>
Armed
with
supernatural
strength
,
he
waded
through
the
sand
,
until
,
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
thirst
,
he
fell
senseless
on
the
earth
.
<EOS>
What
fragrant
coolness
revived
him
;
what
gushing
sound
was
that
?
 
<EOS>
Water
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
indeed
a
well
;
and
the
clear
fresh
stream
was
running
at
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
He
drank
deeply
of
it
,
and
throwing
his
aching
limbs
upon
the
bank
,
sank
into
a
delicious
trance
.
 
<EOS>
The
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
roused
him
.
 
<EOS>
An
old
gray
-
headed
man
tottered
forward
to
slake
his
burning
thirst
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
HE
again
!
<EOS>
Fe
wound
his
arms
round
the
old
man
's
body
,
and
held
him
back
.
<EOS>
He
struggled
,
and
shrieked
for
water
---
for
but
one
drop
of
water
to
save
his
life
!
 
<EOS>
But
he
held
the
old
man
firmly
,
and
watched
his
agonies
with
greedy
eyes
;
and
when
his
lifeless
head
fell
forward
on
his
bosom
,
he
rolled
the
corpse
from
him
with
his
feet
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
the
fever
left
him
,
and
consciousness
returned
,
he
awoke
to
find
himself
rich
and
free
,
to
hear
that
the
parent
who
would
have
let
him
die
in
jail
---
WOULD
!
<EOS>
who
HAD
let
those
who
were
far
dearer
to
him
than
his
own
existence
die
of
want
,
and
sickness
of
heart
that
medicine
can
not
cure
---
had
been
found
dead
in
his
bed
of
down
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
had
all
the
heart
to
leave
his
son
a
beggar
,
but
proud
even
of
his
health
and
strength
,
had
put
off
the
act
till
it
was
too
late
,
and
now
might
gnash
his
teeth
in
the
other
world
,
at
the
thought
of
the
wealth
his
remissness
had
left
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
awoke
to
this
,
and
he
awoke
to
more
.
 
<EOS>
To
recollect
the
purpose
for
which
he
lived
,
and
to
remember
that
his
enemy
was
his
wife
's
own
father
---
the
man
who
had
cast
him
into
prison
,
and
who
,
when
his
daughter
and
her
child
sued
at
his
feet
for
mercy
,
had
spurned
them
from
his
door
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
he
cursed
the
weakness
that
prevented
him
from
being
up
,
and
active
,
in
his
scheme
of
vengeance
!
"
<EOS>
He
caused
himself
to
be
carried
from
the
scene
of
his
loss
and
misery
,
and
conveyed
to
a
quiet
residence
on
the
sea
-
coast
;
not
in
the
hope
of
recovering
his
peace
of
mind
or
happiness
,
for
both
were
fled
for
ever
;
but
to
restore
his
prostrate
energies
,
and
meditate
on
his
darling
object
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
,
some
evil
spirit
cast
in
his
way
the
opportunity
for
his
first
,
most
horrible
revenge
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
summer
-
time
;
and
wrapped
in
his
gloomy
thoughts
,
he
would
issue
from
his
solitary
lodgings
early
in
the
evening
,
and
wandering
along
a
narrow
path
beneath
the
cliffs
,
to
a
wild
and
lonely
spot
that
had
struck
his
fancy
in
his
ramblings
,
seat
himself
on
some
fallen
fragment
of
the
rock
,
and
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
,
remain
there
for
hours
---
sometimes
until
night
had
completely
closed
in
,
and
the
long
shadows
of
the
frowning
cliffs
above
his
head
cast
a
thick
,
black
darkness
on
every
object
near
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
seated
here
,
one
calm
evening
,
in
his
old
position
,
now
and
then
raising
his
head
to
watch
the
flight
of
a
sea
-
gull
,
or
carry
his
eye
along
the
glorious
crimson
path
,
which
,
commencing
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
,
seemed
to
lead
to
its
very
verge
where
the
sun
was
setting
,
when
the
profound
stillness
of
the
spot
was
broken
by
a
loud
cry
for
help
;
he
listened
,
doubtful
of
his
having
heard
aright
,
when
the
cry
was
repeated
with
even
greater
vehemence
than
before
,
and
,
starting
to
his
feet
,
he
hastened
in
the
direction
whence
it
proceeded
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
tale
told
itself
at
once
:
some
scattered
garments
lay
on
the
beach
;
a
human
head
was
just
visible
above
the
waves
at
a
little
distance
from
the
shore
;
and
an
old
man
,
wringing
his
hands
in
agony
,
was
running
to
and
fro
,
shrieking
for
assistance
.
<EOS>
The
invalid
,
whose
strength
was
now
sufficiently
restored
,
threw
off
his
coat
,
and
rushed
towards
the
sea
,
with
the
intention
of
plunging
in
,
and
dragging
the
drowning
man
ashore
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Hasten
here
,
Sir
,
in
God
's
name
;
help
,
help
,
sir
,
for
the
love
of
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
my
son
,
Sir
,
my
only
son
!
"
said
the
old
man
frantically
,
as
he
advanced
to
meet
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
only
son
,
Sir
,
and
he
is
dying
before
his
father
's
eyes
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
the
first
word
the
old
man
uttered
,
the
stranger
checked
himself
in
his
career
,
and
,
folding
his
arms
,
stood
perfectly
motionless
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Great
God
!
"
exclaimed
the
old
man
,
recoiling
,
"
Heyling
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
stranger
smiled
,
and
was
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Heyling
!
"
said
the
old
man
wildly
;
"
my
boy
,
Heyling
,
my
dear
boy
,
look
,
look
!
"
<EOS>
Gasping
for
breath
,
the
miserable
father
pointed
to
the
spot
where
the
young
man
was
struggling
for
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Hark
!
"
said
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
cries
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
alive
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Heyling
,
save
him
,
save
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
stranger
smiled
again
,
and
remained
immovable
as
a
statue
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
have
wronged
you
,
"
shrieked
the
old
man
,
falling
on
his
knees
,
and
clasping
his
hands
together
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
revenged
;
take
my
all
,
my
life
;
cast
me
into
the
water
at
your
feet
,
and
,
if
human
nature
can
repress
a
struggle
,
I
will
die
,
without
stirring
hand
or
foot
.
<EOS>
Do
it
,
Heyling
,
do
it
,
but
save
my
boy
;
he
is
so
young
,
Heyling
,
so
young
to
die
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
Listen
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
grasping
the
old
man
fiercely
by
the
wrist
;
"
I
will
have
life
for
life
,
and
here
is
ONE
.
 
<EOS>
MY
child
died
,
before
his
father
's
eyes
,
a
far
more
agonising
and
painful
death
than
that
young
slanderer
of
his
sister
's
worth
is
meeting
while
I
speak
.
 
<EOS>
You
laughed
---
<EOS>
laughed
in
your
daughter
's
face
,
where
death
had
already
set
his
hand
---
at
our
sufferings
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
What
think
you
of
them
now
!
 
<EOS>
See
there
,
see
there
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
the
stranger
spoke
,
he
pointed
to
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
A
faint
cry
died
away
upon
its
surface
;
the
last
powerful
struggle
of
the
dying
man
agitated
the
rippling
waves
for
a
few
seconds
;
and
the
spot
where
he
had
gone
down
into
his
early
grave
,
was
undistinguishable
from
the
surrounding
water
.
   
<EOS>
"
Three
years
had
elapsed
,
when
a
gentleman
alighted
from
a
private
carriage
at
the
door
of
a
London
attorney
,
then
well
known
as
a
man
of
no
great
nicety
in
his
professional
dealings
,
and
requested
a
private
interview
on
business
of
importance
.
<EOS>
Although
evidently
not
past
the
prime
of
life
,
his
face
was
pale
,
haggard
,
and
dejected
;
and
it
did
not
require
the
acute
perception
of
the
man
of
business
,
to
discern
at
a
glance
,
that
disease
or
suffering
had
done
more
to
work
a
change
in
his
appearance
,
than
the
mere
hand
of
time
could
have
accomplished
in
twice
the
period
of
his
whole
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
wish
you
to
undertake
some
legal
business
for
me
,
"
said
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
attorney
bowed
obsequiously
,
and
glanced
at
a
large
packet
which
the
gentleman
carried
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
His
visitor
observed
the
look
,
and
proceeded
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
It
is
no
common
business
,
"
said
he
;
"
nor
have
these
papers
reached
my
hands
without
long
trouble
and
great
expense
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
attorney
cast
a
still
more
anxious
look
at
the
packet
;
and
his
visitor
,
untying
the
string
that
bound
it
,
disclosed
a
quantity
of
promissory
notes
,
with
copies
of
deeds
,
and
other
documents
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Upon
these
papers
,
"
said
the
client
,
"
the
man
whose
name
they
bear
,
has
raised
,
as
you
will
see
,
large
sums
of
money
,
for
years
past
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
tacit
understanding
between
him
and
the
men
into
whose
hands
they
originally
went
---
and
from
whom
I
have
by
degrees
purchased
the
whole
,
for
treble
and
quadruple
their
nominal
value
---
that
these
loans
should
be
from
time
to
time
renewed
,
until
a
given
period
had
elapsed
.
 
<EOS>
Such
an
understanding
is
nowhere
expressed
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
sustained
many
losses
of
late
;
and
these
obligations
accumulating
upon
him
at
once
,
would
crush
him
to
the
earth
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
"
The
whole
amount
is
many
thousands
of
pounds
,
"
said
the
attorney
,
looking
over
the
papers
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
It
is
,
"
said
the
client
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
What
are
we
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
man
of
business
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Do
!
"
replied
the
client
,
with
sudden
vehemence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Put
every
engine
of
the
law
in
force
,
every
trick
that
ingenuity
can
devise
and
rascality
execute
;
fair
means
and
foul
;
the
open
oppression
of
the
law
,
aided
by
all
the
craft
of
its
most
ingenious
practitioners
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
him
die
a
harassing
and
lingering
death
.
 
<EOS>
Ruin
him
,
seize
and
sell
his
lands
and
goods
,
drive
him
from
house
and
home
,
and
drag
him
forth
a
beggar
in
his
old
age
,
to
die
in
a
common
jail
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
"
But
the
costs
,
my
dear
Sir
,
the
costs
of
all
this
,
"
reasoned
the
attorney
,
when
he
had
recovered
from
his
momentary
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
defendant
be
a
man
of
straw
,
who
is
to
pay
the
costs
,
Sir
?
"
   
"
"
Name
any
sum
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
his
hand
trembling
so
violently
with
excitement
,
that
he
could
scarcely
hold
the
pen
he
seized
as
he
spoke
---
"
any
sum
,
and
it
is
yours
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afraid
to
name
it
,
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
not
think
it
dear
,
if
you
gain
my
object
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
attorney
named
a
large
sum
,
at
hazard
,
as
the
advance
he
should
require
to
secure
himself
against
the
possibility
of
loss
;
but
more
with
the
view
of
ascertaining
how
far
his
client
was
really
disposed
to
go
,
than
with
any
idea
that
he
would
comply
with
the
demand
.
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
wrote
a
cheque
upon
his
banker
,
for
the
whole
amount
,
and
left
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
draft
was
duly
honoured
,
and
the
attorney
,
finding
that
his
strange
client
might
be
safely
relied
upon
,
commenced
his
work
in
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
For
more
than
two
years
afterwards
,
Mr
Heyling
would
sit
whole
days
together
,
in
the
office
,
poring
over
the
papers
as
they
accumulated
,
and
reading
again
and
again
,
his
eyes
gleaming
with
joy
,
the
letters
of
remonstrance
,
the
prayers
for
a
little
delay
,
the
representations
of
the
certain
ruin
in
which
the
opposite
party
must
be
involved
,
which
poured
in
,
as
suit
after
suit
,
and
process
after
process
,
was
commenced
.
 
<EOS>
To
all
applications
for
a
brief
indulgence
,
there
was
but
one
reply
---
<EOS>
the
money
must
be
paid
.
 
<EOS>
Land
,
house
,
furniture
,
each
in
its
turn
,
was
taken
under
some
one
of
the
numerous
executions
which
were
issued
;
and
the
old
man
himself
would
have
been
immured
in
prison
<EOS>
had
he
not
escaped
the
vigilance
of
the
officers
,
and
fled
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
implacable
animosity
of
Heyling
,
so
far
from
being
satiated
by
the
success
of
his
persecution
,
increased
a
hundredfold
with
the
ruin
he
inflicted
.
 
<EOS>
On
being
informed
of
the
old
man
's
flight
,
his
fury
was
unbounded
.
 
<EOS>
He
gnashed
his
teeth
with
rage
,
tore
the
hair
from
his
head
,
and
assailed
with
horrid
imprecations
the
men
who
had
been
intrusted
with
the
writ
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
only
restored
to
comparative
calmness
by
repeated
assurances
of
the
certainty
of
discovering
the
fugitive
.
 
<EOS>
Agents
were
sent
in
quest
of
him
,
in
all
directions
;
every
stratagem
that
could
be
invented
was
resorted
to
,
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
his
place
of
retreat
;
but
it
was
all
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
Half
a
year
had
passed
over
,
and
he
was
still
undiscovered
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
length
late
one
night
,
Heyling
,
of
whom
nothing
had
been
seen
for
many
weeks
before
,
appeared
at
his
attorney
's
private
residence
,
and
sent
up
word
that
a
gentleman
wished
to
see
him
instantly
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
attorney
,
who
had
recognised
his
voice
from
above
stairs
,
could
order
the
servant
to
admit
him
,
he
had
rushed
up
the
staircase
,
and
entered
the
drawing
-
room
pale
and
breathless
.
<EOS>
Having
closed
the
door
,
to
prevent
being
overheard
,
he
sank
into
a
chair
,
and
said
,
in
a
low
voice
---
   
"
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
I
have
found
him
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
No
!
"
said
the
attorney
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
done
,
my
dear
sir
,
well
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
He
lies
concealed
in
a
wretched
lodging
in
Camden
Town
,
"
said
Heyling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
is
as
well
we
DID
lose
sight
of
him
,
for
he
has
been
living
alone
there
,
in
the
most
abject
misery
,
all
the
time
,
and
he
is
poor
---
very
poor
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
Very
good
,
"
said
the
attorney
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
have
the
caption
made
to
-
morrow
,
of
course
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Heyling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
 
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
The
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
surprised
at
my
wishing
to
postpone
it
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
ghastly
smile
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
had
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
day
is
an
anniversary
in
his
life
:
let
it
be
done
then
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
said
the
attorney
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
write
down
instructions
for
the
officer
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
"
No
;
let
him
meet
me
here
,
at
eight
in
the
evening
,
and
I
will
accompany
him
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
met
on
the
appointed
night
,
and
,
hiring
a
hackney
-
coach
,
directed
the
driver
to
stop
at
that
corner
of
the
old
Pancras
Road
,
at
which
stands
the
parish
workhouse
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
time
they
alighted
there
,
it
was
quite
dark
;
and
,
proceeding
by
the
dead
wall
in
front
of
the
Veterinary
Hospital
,
they
entered
a
small
by
-
street
,
which
is
,
or
was
at
that
time
,
called
Little
College
Street
,
and
which
,
whatever
it
may
be
now
,
was
in
those
days
a
desolate
place
enough
,
surrounded
by
little
else
than
fields
and
ditches
.
   
<EOS>
"
Having
drawn
the
travelling
-
cap
he
had
on
half
over
his
face
,
and
muffled
himself
in
his
cloak
,
Heyling
stopped
before
the
meanest
-
looking
house
in
the
street
,
and
knocked
gently
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
at
once
opened
by
a
woman
,
who
dropped
a
curtsey
of
recognition
,
and
Heyling
,
whispering
the
officer
to
remain
below
,
crept
gently
upstairs
,
and
,
opening
the
door
of
the
front
room
,
entered
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
object
of
his
search
and
his
unrelenting
animosity
,
now
a
decrepit
old
man
,
was
seated
at
a
bare
deal
table
,
on
which
stood
a
miserable
candle
.
 
<EOS>
He
started
on
the
entrance
of
the
stranger
,
and
rose
feebly
to
his
feet
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
What
now
,
what
now
?
"
said
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
fresh
misery
is
this
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
want
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
"
A
word
with
YOU
,
"
replied
Heyling
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
seated
himself
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
,
and
,
throwing
off
his
cloak
and
cap
,
disclosed
his
features
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
old
man
seemed
instantly
deprived
of
speech
.
 
<EOS>
He
fell
backward
in
his
chair
,
and
,
clasping
his
hands
together
,
gazed
on
the
apparition
with
a
mingled
look
of
abhorrence
and
fear
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
This
day
six
years
,
"
said
Heyling
,
"
I
claimed
the
life
you
owed
me
for
my
child
's
.
 
<EOS>
Beside
the
lifeless
form
of
your
daughter
,
old
man
,
I
swore
to
live
a
life
of
revenge
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
swerved
from
my
purpose
for
a
moment
's
space
;
but
if
I
had
,
one
thought
of
her
uncomplaining
,
suffering
look
,
as
she
drooped
away
,
or
of
the
starving
face
of
our
innocent
child
,
would
have
nerved
me
to
my
task
.
 
<EOS>
My
first
act
of
requital
<EOS>
you
well
remember
:
this
is
my
last
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
old
man
shivered
,
and
his
hands
dropped
powerless
by
his
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
leave
England
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Heyling
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
-
night
I
consign
you
to
the
living
death
to
which
you
devoted
her
---
a
hopeless
prison
---
"
   
"
He
raised
his
eyes
to
the
old
man
's
countenance
,
and
paused
.
<EOS>
He
lifted
the
light
to
his
face
,
set
it
gently
down

"
You
had
better
see
to
the
old
man
,
"
he
said
to
the
woman
,
as
he
opened
the
door
,
and
motioned
the
officer
to
follow
him
into
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
is
ill
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
woman
closed
the
door
,
ran
hastily
upstairs
,
and
found
him
lifeless
.
   
<EOS>
"
Beneath
a
plain
gravestone
,
in
one
of
the
most
peaceful
and
secluded
churchyards
in
Kent
,
where
wild
flowers
mingle
with
the
grass
,
and
the
soft
landscape
around
forms
the
fairest
spot
in
the
garden
of
England
,
lie
the
bones
of
the
young
mother
and
her
gentle
child
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
ashes
of
the
father
do
not
mingle
with
theirs
;
nor
,
from
that
night
forward
,
did
the
attorney
ever
gain
the
remotest
clue
to
the
subsequent
history
of
his
queer
client
.
<EOS>
"
As
the
old
man
concluded
his
tale
,
he
advanced
to
a
peg
in
one
corner
,
and
taking
down
his
hat
and
coat
,
put
them
on
with
great
deliberation
;
and
,
without
saying
another
word
,
walked
slowly
away
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
gentleman
with
the
Mosaic
studs
had
fallen
asleep
,
and
the
major
part
of
the
company
were
deeply
occupied
in
the
humorous
process
of
dropping
melted
tallow
-
grease
into
his
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
Mr
Pickwick
departed
unnoticed
,
and
having
settled
his
own
score
,
and
that
of
Mr
Weller
,
issued
forth
,
in
company
with
that
gentleman
,
from
beneath
the
portal
of
the
Magpie

<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
journeys
to
Ipswich
and
meets
with
a
romantic
adventure
with
a
middle

aged
lady
in
yellow
curl
papers
 
<EOS>
"
That
'
ere

"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Weller
of
his
affectionate
son
,
as
he
entered
the
yard
of
the
Bull
Inn
,
Whitechapel
,
with
a
travelling

bag
and
a
small
portmanteau
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
might
ha

made
a
worser
guess

old
feller

"
replied
Mr
Weller
the
younger
,
setting
down
his
burden
in
the
yard
,
and
sitting
himself
down
upon
it
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
"
The

He

<EOS>
"
Queer

the

What

continued
Mr

,
after
a
short
pause
,
during

he
had
significantly
struck
the
side

some

there
was
tea

and
a

women
as

lookin

as

<EOS>
By

by
,
there
comes
a
great
bustle
downstairs
,
and
a
lanky
chap
with
a
red
nose
and
a
white
neckcloth
rushes
up
,
and
sings
out
,
"
<EOS>
Here
's
the

Such
goin

<EOS>
"
The
kiss

"
says
the
shepherd
;
and
then
he
kissed
the
women
all
round
,
and
ven
he
'd
done
,
the
man
vith
the
red
nose
began
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
just
a
-
thinkin
'
whether
I
had
n't
better
begin
too
---
"
specially
as
there
was
a
wery
nice
lady
<EOS>
a

sittin
'
next
me
---
<EOS>
ven
in
comes
the
tea
,
and
your
mother
-
in

law
,
as
had
been
makin
'
the
kettle
bile
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
At
it
they
went
,
tooth
and
nail
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
precious
loud
hymn
,
Sammy
,
while
the
tea
was
a
brewing
;
such
a
grace
,
such
eatin
'
and
drinkin
'
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
could
ha
'
seen
the
shepherd
walkin
'
into
the
ham
and
muffins
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
such
a
chap
to
eat
and
drink
---
never
.
 
<EOS>
The
red
-
nosed
man
warn't
<EOS>
by
no
means
the
sort
of
person
you
'd
like
to
grub
by
contract
,
but
he
was
nothin'
to
the
shepherd
.
<EOS>
Well
;
arter
the
tea
was
over
,
they
sang
another
hymn
,
and
then
the
shepherd
began
to
preach
:
and
wery
<EOS>
well
he
did
it
,
considerin
'
<EOS>
how
heavy
them
muffins
must
have
lied
on
his
chest
.
<EOS>
Presently
he
pulls
up
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
and
hollers
out
,
"
<EOS>
Where
is
the
sinner
;
where
is
the
mis'rable
sinner
?
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
all
the
women
looked
at
me
,
and
began
to
groan
as
if
they
was
a
-
dying
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
rather
sing'ler
,
but
howsoever
,
I
says
nothing
.
<EOS>
Presently
he
pulls
up
again
,
and
lookin
'
wery
hard
at
me
,
says
,
"
<EOS>
Where
is
the
sinner
;
where
is
the
mis'rable
sinner
?
"
and
all
the
women
groans
again
,
ten
times
louder
than
afore
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
rather
savage
at
this
,
so
I
takes
a
step
or
two
for'ard
and
says
,
"
My
friend
,
"
says
I
,
"
did
you
apply
that
'
ere
obserwation
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
"
Stead
of
beggin
'
my
pardon
as
any
gen'l'm'n
would
ha
'
done
,
he
got
more
abusive
than
ever
:
---
called
me
a
wessel
,
Sammy
---
a
wessel
of
wrath
---
and
all
sorts
o
'
names
.
 
<EOS>
So
my
blood
being
reg'larly
up
,
I
first
gave
him
two
or
three
for
himself
,
and
then
two
or
three
more
to
hand
over
to
the
man
with
the
red
nose
,
and
walked
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
could
ha
'
heard
how
the
women
screamed
,
Sammy
,
<EOS>
ven
<EOS>
they
picked
up
the
shepherd
from
underneath
the
table
---
Hollo

<EOS>
here
's
the
governor

the
size
of

<EOS>
As
Mr
Weller
spoke
,
Mr
Pickwick
dismounted
from
a
cab
,
and
entered
the
yard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fine

said
Mr

senior

<EOS>
"
Beautiful

echoes
a
red

haired
man
with
an
inquisitive
nose

green
spectacles

who
had
unpacked
himself
from
a

at

Mr

bowed

<EOS>
"
Going

said
the
red

man

<EOS>
Mr

bowed
again

<EOS>
"
Bless

remarkable

said

<EOS>
And
the
red

haired
man
,
who
was
an
important

looking

sharp

nosed
,
mysterious

spoken
personage
,
with
a
bird
-
like
habit
of
giving
his
head
a
jerk
every
time
he
said
anything

smiled
as
if
he
had
made
one
of
the
strangest
discoveries
that
ever

<EOS>
"
I

said
Mr

<EOS>
"
Ah

said

There

Mr

joining
in

conversation

with
an
affable
smile

<EOS>
"
That
's
what
I
call

<EOS>

Not

replied
Mr

in
a
low
tone

<EOS>
"
The
fact
is

I
allow
him

take

liberties

between

I
flatter
myself

Ah

you

I

<EOS>

Here

replied
Mr

much
amused

the
singular
manner

stranger

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
're
all
in
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
will
you
get
up
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
"
replied
Magnus
,
standing
on
the
wheel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
consent
to
get
up
,
in
this
state
of
uncertainty
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
satisfied
from
that
man
's
manner
,
that
the
leather
hat
-
box
is
not
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
solemn
protestations
of
the
hostler
being
wholly
unavailing
,
the
leather
hat
-
box
was
obliged
to
be
raked
up
from
the
lowest
depth
of
the
boot
,
to
satisfy
him
that
it
had
been
safely
packed
;
and
after
he
had
been
assured
on
this
head
,
he
felt
a
solemn
presentiment
,
first
,
that
the
red
bag
was
mislaid
,
and
next
that
the
striped
bag
had
been
stolen
,
and
then
that
the
brown
-
paper
parcel
"
had
come
untied
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
length
when
he
had
received
ocular
demonstration
of
the
groundless
nature
of
each
and
every
of
these
suspicions
,
he
consented
to
climb
up
to
the
roof
of
the
coach
,
observing
that
now
he
had
taken
everything
off
his
mind
,
he
felt
quite
comfortable
and
happy
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
given
to
nervousness
,
ai
n't
you
,
Sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Weller
,
senior
,
eyeing
the
stranger
askance
,
as
he
mounted
to
his
place
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
always
am
rather
about
these
little
matters
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
"
but
I
am
all
right
now
---
quite
right
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
that
's
a
blessin
'
,
said
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sammy
,
help
your
master
up
to
the
box
;
t'other

Sir

it

give
us
your

Sir

<EOS>
Up

<EOS>
You

when
you
was
a

sir

"
<EOS>
"
True
enough
,
that
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
the
breathless
Mr
Pickwick
good
-
humouredly
,
as
he
took
his
seat
on
the
box
beside
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jump
up
in
front
,
Sammy
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
Villam

<EOS>
Take

That

Let

"
 
<EOS>
And
away
went
the
coach
up
Whitechapel
,
to
the
admiration
of
the
whole
population
of
that
pretty
densely
populated
quarter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
wery
nice
neighbourhood
,
this
,
Sir
,
"
said
Sam
,
with
a
touch
of
the
hat
,
which
always
preceded
his
entering
into
conversation
with
his
master
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
indeed
,
Sam
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
surveying
the
crowded
and
filthy
street
through
which
they
were
passing
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
wery
remarkable
circumstance
,
Sir
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
that
poverty
and
oysters
always
seem
to
go
together
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
I
mean
,
sir
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
is
,
that
the
poorer
a
place
is
,
the
greater
call
there
seems
to
be
for
oysters
.
 
<EOS>
Look
here
,
sir
;
here
's
a
oyster
-
stall
to
every
half
-
dozen
houses
.
 
<EOS>
The
street
's
lined
vith
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Blessed
if
I
do
n't
think
that
ven
a
man
's
wery
poor
,
he
rushes
out
of
his
lodgings
,
and
eats
oysters
in
reg'lar
desperation
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
To
be
sure
he
does
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
senior
;
"
and
it
's
just
the
same
vith
pickled
salmon
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Those
are
two
very
remarkable
facts
,
which
never
occurred
to
me
before
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
very
first
place
we
stop
at
,
I
'll
make
a
note
of
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
By
this
time
they
had
reached
the
turnpike
at
Mile
End
;
a
profound
silence
prevailed
until
they
had
got
two
or
three
miles
farther
on
,
when
Mr
Weller
,
senior
,
turning
suddenly
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
queer
life
is
a
pike
-
keeper
's
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
what
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
pike
-
keeper
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
a

keeper
?
"
inquired
Mr
Peter
Magnus
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
old
'
un

a
turnpike
-
keeper
,
gen'l'm'n

"
observed
Mr
Samuel
Weller
,
in
explanation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
I
see
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
;
very
curious
life
.
<EOS>
Very
uncomfortable

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
're
all
on
'em
men
as

met
vith
some
disappointment
in
life
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
senior
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Consequence
of
vich
<EOS>
,
they
retires
from
the
world
,
and
shuts
themselves
up
in
pikes
;
partly
with
the
view
of
being
solitary
,
and
partly
to
rewenge
themselves
on
mankind
by
takin
'
tolls
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
I
never
knew
that
before
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fact
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
;
"
if
they
was
gen'l'm'n
,
you
'd
call
'em
misanthropes
,
but
as
it
is
,
they

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
such
conversation
,
possessing
the
inestimable
charm
of
blending
amusement
with
instruction
,
did
Mr
Weller
beguile
the
tediousness
of
the
journey
,
during
the
greater
part
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
Topics
of
conversation
were
never
wanting
,
for
even
when
any
pause
occurred
in
Mr
Weller
's
loquacity
,
it
was
abundantly
supplied
by
the
desire
evinced
by
Mr
Magnus
to
make
himself
acquainted
with
the
whole
of
the
personal
history
of
his
fellow
-
travellers
,
and
his
loudly
-
expressed
anxiety
at
every
stage
,
respecting
the
safety
and
well
-
being
of
the
two
bags
,
the
leather
hat
-
box
,
and
the
brown
-
paper
parcel
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
main
street
of
Ipswich
,
on
the
left
-
hand
side
of
the
way
,
a
short
distance
after
you
have
passed
through
the
open
space
fronting
the
Town
Hall
,
stands
an
inn
known
far
and
wide
by
the
appellation
of
the
Great
White
Horse
,
rendered
the
more
conspicuous
by
a
stone
statue
of
some
rampacious
animal
with
flowing
mane
and
tail
,
distantly
resembling
an
insane
cart
-
horse
,
which
is
elevated
above
the
principal
door
.
 
<EOS>
The
Great
White
Horse
is
famous
in
the
neighbourhood
,
in
the
same
degree
as
a
prize
ox
,
or
a
county
-
paper
-
chronicled
turnip
,
or
unwieldy
pig
---
for
its
enormous
size
.
 
<EOS>
Never
was
such
labyrinths
of
uncarpeted
passages
,
such
clusters
of
mouldy
,
ill
-
lighted
rooms
,
such
huge
numbers
of
small
dens
for
eating
or
sleeping
in
,
beneath
any
one
roof
,
as
are
collected
together
between
the
four
walls
of
the
Great
White
Horse
at
Ipswich
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
at
the
door
of
this
overgrown
tavern
that
the
London
coach
stopped
,
at
the
same
hour
every
evening
;
and
it
was
from
this
same
London
coach
that
Mr
Pickwick
,
Sam
Weller
,
and
Mr
Peter
Magnus
dismounted
,
on
the
particular
evening
to
which
this
chapter
of
our
history
bears
reference
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
stop
here
,
sir
?
"
inquired
Mr
Peter
Magnus
,
when
the
striped
bag
,
and
the
red
bag
,
and
the
brown
-
paper
parcel
,
and
the
leather
hat
-
box
,
had
all
been
deposited
in
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
stop
here
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
"
said
Mr
Magnus
,
"
<EOS>
I
never
knew
anything
like
these
extraordinary
coincidences
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
stop
here
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
we
dine
together
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
pleasure
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
quite
certain
whether
I
have
any
friends
here
or
not
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
Is
there
any
gentleman
of
the
name
of
Tupman
here
,
waiter
?
"
   
<EOS>
A
corpulent
man
,
with
a
fortnight
's
napkin
under
his
arm
,
and
coeval
stockings
on
his
legs
,
slowly
desisted
from
his
occupation
of
staring
down
the
street
,
on
this
question
being
put
to
him
by
Mr
Pickwick
;
and
,
after
minutely
inspecting
that
gentleman
's
appearance
,
from
the
crown
of
his
hat
to
the
lowest
button
of
his
gaiters
,
replied
emphatically
---
   
"
No
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nor
any
gentleman
of
the
name
of
Snodgrass
?
"
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nor
Winkle
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
friends
have
not
arrived
to
-
day
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
dine
alone
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
Show
us
a
private
room
,
waiter
.
"
   
<EOS>
On
this
request
being
preferred
,
the
corpulent
man
condescended
to
order
the
boots
to
bring
in
the
gentlemen
's
luggage
;
and
preceding
them
down
a
long
,
dark
passage
,
ushered
them
into
a
large
,
badly
-
furnished
apartment
,
with
a
dirty
grate
,
in
which
a
small
fire
was
making
a
wretched
attempt
to
be
cheerful
,
but
was
fast
sinking
beneath
the
dispiriting
influence
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
After
the
lapse
of
an
hour
,
a
bit
of
fish
and
a
steak
was
served
up
to
the
travellers
,
and
when
the
dinner
was
cleared
away
,
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Peter
Magnus
drew
their
chairs
up
to
the
fire
,
and
having
ordered
a
bottle
of
the
worst
possible
port
wine
,
at
the
highest
possible
price
,
for
the
good
of
the
house
,
drank
brandy
-
and
-
water
for
their
own
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peter
Magnus
was
naturally
of
a
very
communicative
disposition
,
and
the
brandy
-
and
-
water
operated
with
wonderful
effect
in
warming
into
life
the
deepest
hidden
secrets
of
his
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
After
sundry
accounts
of
himself
,
his
family
,
his
connections
,
his
friends
,
his
jokes
,
his
business
,
and
his
brothers
(
most
talkative
men
have
a
great
deal
to
say
about
their
brothers
)
,
Mr
Peter
Magnus
took
a
view
of
Mr
Pickwick
through
his
coloured
spectacles
for
several
minutes
,
and
then
said
,
with
an
air
of
modesty
---
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
do

what
DO

Mr

I

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
it
is
wholly
impossible
for
me
to
guess
;
on
business
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Partly
right

Sir

"
replied
Mr
Peter
Magnus
,
"
but
partly
wrong
at
the
same
time
;
try
again
,
Mr
Pickwick

"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
I
must
throw
myself
on
your
mercy

to
tell
me
or
not

as
you
may
think
best

I
should
never

<EOS>
"
Why

then

said
Mr
Peter
Magnus
,
with
a
bashful
titter
,
"
what

Mr

I

Think

replied
Mr

,
with
one
of
his
beaming
smiles
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah

"
said
Mr
Magnus
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
do
you
really

so

Mr
Pickwick

<EOS>
Do

<EOS>
"
Certainly

said
Mr

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No

<EOS>
but
you
're
joking

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not

<EOS>
"
Why

then

said
Mr
Magnus
,
"
to
let
you
into
a
little
secret

I
think
so
too

<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
telling
you

Mr
Pickwick

although
I
'm
dreadful
jealous
by
nature

horrid
---
that
the
lady

in
this
house

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Magnus
took
off
his
spectacles
,
on
purpose
to
wink
,
and
then
put
them
on
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
That

what
you
were
running
out
of
the
room
for

before
dinner

often

said
Mr

archly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush

<EOS>
Yes

you
're
right

that

not
such

<EOS>
"
No

<EOS>

No

Wait

double

<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
Sir

there
is
a
suit
of
clothes
in
that
bag
,
and
a
hat
in
that
box
,
which
,
I
expect
,
in
the
effect
they
will
produce

will
be
invaluable
to

<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes

you
must
have
observed
my
anxiety
about
them
to

day

<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
that
such
another
suit
of
clothes
,
and
such
a
hat

could
be
bought
for
money

Mr
Pickwick

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
congratulated
the
fortunate
owner
of
the
irresistible
garments
on
their
acquisition
;
and
Mr
Peter
Magnus
remained
a
few
moments
apparently
absorbed
in
contemplation
.
<EOS>
"
She

Is
she
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
,
"
said
Mr
Magnus
.
 
<EOS>
"
very
.
 
<EOS>
She
lives
about
twenty
miles
from
here
,
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
she
would
be
here
to
-
night
and
all
to
-
morrow
forenoon
,
and
came
down
to
seize
the
opportunity
.
<EOS>
I
think
an
inn
is
a
good
sort
of
a
place
to
propose
to
a
single
woman
in
,
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
more
likely
to
feel
the
loneliness
of
her
situation
in
travelling
,
perhaps
,
than
she
would
be
at
home
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
,
Mr
Pickwick
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
very
probable
,
"
replied
that
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
said
Mr
Peter
Magnus
,
"
but
I
am
naturally
rather
curious
;
what
may
you
have
come
down
here
for
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
a
far
less
pleasant
errand
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
the
colour
mounting
to
his
face
at
the
recollection
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
down
here
,
Sir
,
to
expose
the
treachery
and
falsehood
of
an
individual
,
upon
whose
truth
and
honour
I
placed
implicit
reliance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
"
said
Mr
Peter
Magnus
,
<EOS>
"
that
's
very
unpleasant
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
lady
,
I
presume
?
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
<EOS>
ah
!
 
<EOS>
Sly
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
sly
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
sir
,
I
would
n't
probe
your
feelings
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
Painful
subjects
,
these
,
sir
,
very
painful
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
mind
me
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
if
you
wish
to
give
vent
to
your
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
it
is
to
be
jilted
,
Sir
;
I
have
endured
that
sort
of
thing
three
or
four
times
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
,
for
your
condolence
on
what
you
presume
to
be
my
melancholy
case
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
winding
up
his
watch
,
and
laying
it
on
the
table
,
"
<EOS>
but
---
"
   
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Mr
Peter
Magnus
,
"
not
a
word
more
;
it
's
a
painful
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
,
I
see
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
time
,
Mr
Pickwick
?
"
<EOS>
"
Past
twelve
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
it
's
time
to
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
never
do
,
sitting
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
pale
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
,
Mr
Pickwick

"
   
<EOS>
At
the
bare
notion
of
such
a
calamity
,
Mr
Peter
Magnus
rang
the
bell
for
the
chambermaid
;
and
the
striped
bag
,
the
red
bag
,
the
leathern
hat
-
box
,
and
the
brown
-
paper
parcel
,
having
been
conveyed
to
his
bedroom
,
he
retired
in
company
with
a
japanned
candlestick
,
to
one
side
of
the
house
,
while
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
another
japanned
candlestick
,
were
conducted
through
a
multitude
of
tortuous
windings
,
to
another
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
your
room
,
sir
,
"
said
the
chambermaid
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
round
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
tolerably
large
double
-
bedded
room
,
with
a
fire
;
upon
the
whole
,
a
more
comfortable
-
looking
apartment
than
Mr
Pickwick
's
short
experience
of
the
accommodations
of
the
Great
White
Horse
had
led
him
to
expect
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nobody
sleeps
in
the
other
bed
,
of
course
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
my
servant
to
bring
me
up
some
hot
water
at
half
-
past
eight
in
the
morning
,
and
that
I
shall
not
want
him
any
more
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Sir
,
"
and
bidding
Mr
Pickwick
good
-
night
,
the
chambermaid
retired
,
and
left
him
alone
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
sat
himself
down
in
a
chair
before
the
fire
,
and
fell
into
a
train
of
rambling
meditations
.
 
<EOS>
First
he
thought
of
his
friends
,
and
wondered
when
they
would
join
him
;
then
his
mind
reverted
to
Mrs
Martha
Bardell
;
and
from
that
lady
it
wandered
,
by
a
natural
process
,
to
the
dingy
counting
-
house
of
Dodson
&
Fogg
.
 
<EOS>
From
Dodson
&
Fogg
's
it
flew
off
at
a
tangent
,
to
the
very
centre
of
the
history
of
the
queer
client
;
and
then
it
came
back
to
the
Great
White
Horse
at
Ipswich
,
with
sufficient
clearness
to
convince
Mr
Pickwick
that
he
was
falling
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
roused
himself
,
and
began
to
undress
,
when
he
recollected
he
had
left
his
watch
on
the
table
downstairs
.
   
<EOS>
Now
this
watch
was
a
special
favourite
with
Mr
Pickwick
,
having
been
carried
about
,
beneath
the
shadow
of
his
waistcoat
,
for
a
greater
number
of
years
than
we
feel
called
upon
to
state
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
The
possibility
of
going
to
sleep
,
unless
it
were
ticking
gently
beneath
his
pillow
,
or
in
the
watch
-
pocket
over
his
head
,
had
never
entered
Mr
Pickwick
's
brain
.
 
<EOS>
So
as
it
was
pretty
late
now
,
and
he
was
unwilling
to
ring
his
bell
at
that
hour
of
the
night
,
he
slipped
on
his
coat
,
of
which
he
had
just
divested
himself
,
and
taking
the
japanned
candlestick
in
his
hand
,
walked
quietly
downstairs
.
<EOS>
The
more
stairs
Mr
Pickwick
went
down
,
the
more
stairs
there
seemed
to
be
to
descend
,
and
again
and
again
,
when
Mr
Pickwick
got
into
some
narrow
passage
,
and
began
to
congratulate
himself
on
having
gained
the
ground
-
floor
,
did
another
flight
of
stairs
appear
before
his
astonished
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
reached
a
stone
hall
,
which
he
remembered
to
have
seen
when
he
entered
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Passage
after
passage
did
he
explore
<EOS>
;
room
after
room
did
he
peep
into
;
at
length
,
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
giving
up
the
search
in
despair
,
he
opened
the
door
of
the
identical
room
in
which
he
had
spent
the
evening
,
and
beheld
his
missing
property
on
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
seized
the
watch
in
triumph
,
and
proceeded
to
retrace
his
steps
to
his
bedchamber
.
 
<EOS>
If
his
progress
downward
had
been
attended
with
difficulties
and
uncertainty
,
his
journey
back
was
infinitely
more
perplexing
.
 
<EOS>
Rows
of
doors
,
garnished
with
boots
of
every
shape
,
make
,
and
size
,
branched
off
in
every
possible
direction
.
 
<EOS>
A
dozen
times
did
he
softly
turn
the
handle
of
some
bedroom
door
which
resembled
his
own
,
when
a
gruff
cry
from
within
of
"
Who
the
devil
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
or
"
What
do
you
want
here
?
<EOS>
"
caused
him
to
steal
away
,
on
tiptoe
,
with
a
perfectly
marvellous
celerity
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
reduced
to
the
verge
of
despair
,
when
an
open
door
attracted
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
He
peeped
in
.
 
<EOS>
Right
at
last
!
<EOS>
There
were
the
two
beds
,
whose
situation
he
perfectly
remembered
,
and
the
fire
still
burning
.
 
<EOS>
His
candle
,
not
a
long
one
when
he
first
received
it
,
had
flickered
away
in
the
drafts
of
air
through
which
he
had
passed
and
sank
into
the
socket
as
he
closed
the
door
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
matter
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
I
can
undress
myself
just
as
well
by
the
light
of
the
fire
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
bedsteads
stood
one
on
each
side
of
the
door
;
and
on
the
inner
side
of
each
was
a
little
path
,
terminating
in
a
rush
-
bottomed
chair
,
just
wide
enough
to
admit
of
a
person
's
getting
into
or
out
of
bed
,
on
that
side
,
if
he
or
she
thought
proper
.
<EOS>
Having
carefully
drawn
the
curtains
of
his
bed
on
the
outside
,
Mr
Pickwick
sat
down
on
the
rush
-
bottomed
chair
,
and
leisurely
divested
himself
of
his
shoes
and
gaiters
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
took
off
and
folded
up
his
coat
,
waistcoat
,
and
neckcloth
,
and
slowly
drawing
on
his
tasselled
nightcap
,
secured
it
firmly
on
his
head
,
by
tying
beneath
his
chin
the
strings
which
he
always
had
attached
to
that
article
of
dress
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
at
this
moment
that
the
absurdity
of
his
recent
bewilderment
struck
upon
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Throwing
himself
back
in
the
rush
-
bottomed
chair
,
Mr
Pickwick
laughed
to
himself
so
heartily
,
that
it
would
have
been
quite
delightful
to
any
man
of
well
-
constituted
mind
to
have
watched
the
smiles
that
expanded
his
amiable
features
as
they
shone
forth
from
beneath
the
nightcap
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
best
idea
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
to
himself
,
smiling
till
he
almost
cracked
the
nightcap
strings
---
<EOS>
"
it
is
the
best
idea
,
my
losing
myself
in
this
place
,
and
wandering
about
these
staircases
,
that
I
ever
heard
of
.
 
<EOS>
Droll
,
droll
,
very
droll
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Pickwick
smiled
again
,
a
broader
smile
than
before
,
and
was
about
to
continue
the
process
of
undressing
,
in
the
best
possible
humour
,
when
he
was
suddenly
stopped
by
a
most
unexpected
interruption
:
to
wit
,
the
entrance
into
the
room
of
some
person
with
a
candle
,
who
,
after
locking
the
door
,
advanced
to
the
dressing
-
table
,
and
set
down
the
light
upon
it
.
   
<EOS>
The
smile
that
played
on
Mr
Pickwick
's
features
was
instantaneously
lost
in
a
look
of
the
most
unbounded
and
wonder
-
stricken
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
The
person
,
whoever
it
was
,
had
come
in
so
suddenly
and
with
so
little
noise
,
that
Mr
Pickwick
had
had
no
time
to
call
out
,
or
oppose
their
entrance
.
 
<EOS>
Who
could
it
be
?
 
<EOS>
A
robber
?
 
<EOS>
Some
evil
-
minded
person
who
had
seen
him
come
upstairs
with
a
handsome
watch
in
his
hand
,
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
he
to
do
?
   
<EOS>
The
only
way
in
which
Mr
Pickwick
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
his
mysterious
visitor
with
the
least
danger
of
being
seen
himself
,
was
by
creeping
on
to
the
bed
,
and
peeping
out
from
between
the
curtains
on
the
opposite
side
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
manoeuvre
he
accordingly
resorted
.
 
<EOS>
Keeping
the
curtains
carefully
closed
with
his
hand
,
so
that
nothing
more
of
him
could
be
seen
than
his
face
and
nightcap
,
and
putting
on
his
spectacles
,
he
mustered
up
courage
and
looked
out
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
almost
fainted
with
horror
and
dismay
.
 
<EOS>
Standing
before
the
dressing
-
glass
was
a
middle
-
aged
lady
,
in
yellow
curl
-
papers
,
busily
engaged
in
brushing
what
ladies
call
their
"
back
-
hair
.
"
<EOS>
However
the
unconscious
middle
-
aged
lady
came
into
that
room
,
it
was
quite
clear
that
she
contemplated
remaining
there
for
the
night
;
for
she
had
brought
a
rushlight
and
shade
with
her
,
which
,
with
praiseworthy
precaution
against
fire
,
she
had
stationed
in
a
basin
on
the
floor
,
where
it
was
glimmering
away
,
like
a
gigantic
lighthouse
in
a
particularly
small
piece
of
water
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
soul
!
"
<EOS>
thought
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
what
a
dreadful
thing
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
lady
;
and
in
went
Mr
Pickwick
's
head
with
automaton
-
like
rapidity
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
met
with
anything
so
awful
as
this
,
"
thought
poor
Mr
Pickwick
,
the
cold
perspiration
starting
in
drops
upon
his
nightcap
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
fearful
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
quite
impossible
to
resist
the
urgent
desire
to
see
what
was
going
forward
.
 
<EOS>
So
out
went
Mr
Pickwick
's
head
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
prospect
was
worse
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
middle
-
aged
lady
had
finished
arranging
her
hair
;
had
carefully
enveloped
it
in
a
muslin
nightcap
with
a
small
plaited
border
;
and
was
gazing
pensively
on
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
matter
is
growing
alarming
,
"
reasoned
Mr
Pickwick
with
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
allow
things
to
go
on
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
self
-
possession
of
that
lady
,
it
is
clear
to
me
that
I
must
have
come
into
the
wrong
room
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
call
out
she
'll
alarm
the
house
;
but
if
I
remain
here
the
consequences
will
be
still
more
frightful
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
it
is
quite
unnecessary
to
say
,
was
one
of
the
most
modest
and
delicate
-
minded
of
mortals
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
idea
of
exhibiting
his
nightcap
to
a
lady
overpowered
him
,
but
he
had
tied
those
confounded
strings
in
a
knot
,
and
,
do
what
he
would
,
he
could
n't
get
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
The
disclosure
must
be
made
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
other
way
of
doing
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
shrunk
behind
the
curtains
,
and
called
out
very
loudly
---
   
<EOS>
"
Ha
-
hum
!
"
   
<EOS>
That
the
lady
started
at
this
unexpected
sound
was
evident
,
by
her
falling
up
against
the
rushlight
shade
;
that
she
persuaded
herself
it
must
have
been
the
effect
of
imagination
was
equally
clear
,
for
when
Mr
Pickwick
,
under
the
impression
that
she
had
fainted
away
stone
-
dead
with
fright
,
ventured
to
peep
out
again
,
she
was
gazing
pensively
on
the
fire
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
Most
extraordinary
female
this
,
"
thought
Mr
Pickwick
,
popping
in
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
-
hum
!
"
   
<EOS>
These
last
sounds
,
so
like
those
in
which
,
as
legends
inform
us
,
the
ferocious
giant
Blunderbore
was
in
the
habit
of
expressing
his
opinion
that
it
was
time
to
lay
the
cloth
,
were
too
distinctly
audible
to
be
again
mistaken
for
the
workings
of
fancy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gracious
Heaven
!
"
said
the
middle
-
aged
lady
,
"
what
's
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
---

it
's
---
only
a
gentleman
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
from
behind
the
curtains
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
gentleman
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
lady
,
with
a
terrific
scream
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
over
!
"
thought
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
strange
man
!
<EOS>
"
shrieked
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Another
instant
and
the
house
would
be
alarmed
.
 
<EOS>
Her
garments
rustled
as
she
rushed
towards
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
thrusting
out
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
extremity
of
his
desperation
,
"
ma'am
!
"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
although
Mr
Pickwick
was
not
actuated
by
any
definite
object
in
putting
out
his
head
,
it
was
instantaneously
productive
of
a
good
effect
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
,
as
we
have
already
stated
,
was
near
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
She
must
pass
it
,
to
reach
the
staircase
,
and
she
would
most
undoubtedly
have
done
so
by
this
time
,
had
not
the
sudden
apparition
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
nightcap
driven
her
back
into
the
remotest
corner
of
the
apartment
,
where
she
stood
staring
wildly
at
Mr
Pickwick
,
while
Mr
Pickwick
in
his
turn
stared
wildly
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wretch
,
"
said
the
lady
,
covering
her
eyes
with
her
hands
,
"
what
do
you
want
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
ma'am
;
nothing
whatever
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
earnestly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
!
"
said
the
lady
,
looking
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
ma'am
,
upon
my
honour
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
nodding
his
head
so
energetically
,
that
the
tassel
of
his
nightcap
danced
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
almost
ready
to
sink
,
ma'am
,
beneath
the
confusion
of
addressing
a
lady
in
my
nightcap
<EOS>
(
here
the
lady
hastily
snatched
off
hers
)
,
but
I
ca
n't
get
it
off
,
ma'am
<EOS>
(
here
Mr
Pickwick
gave
it
a
tremendous
tug
,
in
proof
of
the
statement
)
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
evident
to
me
,
ma'am
,
now
,
that
I
have
mistaken
this
bedroom
for
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
not
been
here
five
minutes
,
ma'am
,
when
you
suddenly
entered
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
this
improbable
story
be
really
true
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
lady
,
sobbing
violently
,
"
you
will
leave
it
instantly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
ma'am
,
with
the
greatest
pleasure
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Instantly
,
sir
,
"
said
the
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
ma'am
,
"
interposed
Mr
Pickwick
,
very
quickly
.
"
<EOS>
Certainly
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
I
---
<EOS>
I
---
am
very
sorry
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
making
his
appearance
at
the
bottom
of
the
bed
,
"
to
have
been
the
innocent
occasion
of
this
alarm
and
emotion
;
deeply
sorry
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
lady
pointed
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
One
excellent
quality
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
character
was
beautifully
displayed
at
this
moment
,
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
Although
he
had
hastily
Put
on
his
hat
over
his
nightcap
,
after
the
manner
of
the
old
patrol
;
although
he
carried
his
shoes
and
gaiters
in
his
hand
,
and
his
coat
and
waistcoat
over
his
arm
;
nothing
could
subdue
his
native
politeness
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
exceedingly
sorry
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
bowing
very
low
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
,
Sir
,
you
will
at
once
leave
the
room
,
"
said
the
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
Immediately
,
ma'am
;
this
instant
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
opening
the
door
,
and
dropping
both
his
shoes
with
a
crash
in
so
doing
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
trust
,
ma'am
,
"
resumed
Mr
Pickwick
,
gathering
up
his
shoes
,
and
turning
round
to
bow
again
---
<EOS>
"
I
trust
,
ma'am
,
that
my
unblemished
character
,
and
the
devoted
respect
I
entertain
for
your
sex
,
will
plead
as
some
slight
excuse
for
this
---
"
<EOS>
But
before
Mr
Pickwick
could
conclude
the
sentence
,
the
lady
had
thrust
him
into
the
passage
,
and
locked
and
bolted
the
door
behind
him
.
   
<EOS>
Whatever
grounds
of
self
-
congratulation
Mr
Pickwick
might
have
for
having
escaped
so
quietly
from
his
late
awkward
situation
,
his
present
position
was
by
no
means
enviable
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
alone
,
in
an
open
passage
,
in
a
strange
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
half
dressed
;
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
he
could
find
his
way
in
perfect
darkness
to
a
room
which
he
had
been
wholly
unable
to
discover
with
a
light
,
and
if
he
made
the
slightest
noise
in
his
fruitless
attempts
to
do
so
,
he
stood
every
chance
of
being
shot
at
,
and
perhaps
killed
,
by
some
wakeful
traveller
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
resource
but
<EOS>
to
remain
where
he
was
until
daylight
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
So
after
groping
his
way
a
few
paces
down
the
passage
,
and
,
to
his
infinite
alarm
,
stumbling
over
several
pairs
of
boots
in
so
doing
,
Mr
Pickwick
crouched
into
a
little
recess
in
the
wall
,
to
wait
for
morning
,
as
philosophically
as
he
might
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
not
destined
,
however
,
to
undergo
this
additional
trial
of
patience
;
for
he
had
not
been
long
ensconced
in
his
present
concealment
when
,
to
his
unspeakable
horror
,
a
man
,
bearing
a
light
,
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
His
horror
was
suddenly
converted
into
joy
,
however
,
when
he
recognised
the
form
of
his
faithful
attendant
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
indeed
Mr
Samuel
Weller
,
who
after
sitting
up
thus
late
,
in
conversation
with
the
boots
,
who
was
sitting
up
for
the
mail
,
was
now
about
to
retire
to
rest
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
suddenly
appearing
before
him
,
"
where
's
my
bedroom
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
stared
at
his
master
with
the
most
emphatic
surprise
;
and
it
was
not
until
the
question
had
been
repeated
three
several
times
,
that
he
turned
round
,
and
led
the
way
to
the
long
-
sought
apartment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
he
got
into
bed
,
"
I
have
made
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
mistakes
to
-
night
,
that
ever
were
heard
of
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Wery
likely
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
drily
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
of
this
I
am
determined
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
that
if
I
were
to
stop
in
this
house
for
six
months
,
I
would
never
trust
myself
about
it
,
alone
,
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
wery
prudentest
resolution
as
you
could
come
to
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
rayther
want
somebody
to
look
arter
you
,
Sir
,
when
your
judgment
goes
out
a
wisitin
'
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
that
,
Sam
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
He
raised
himself
in
bed
,
and
extended
his
hand
,
as
if
he
were
about
to
say
something
more
;
but
suddenly
checking
himself
,
turned
round
,
and
bade
his
valet
"
Good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
He
paused
when
he
got
outside
the
door
---
shook
his
head
---
walked
on
---
stopped
---
<EOS>
snuffed
the
candle
---
shook
his
head
again
---
and
finally
proceeded
slowly
to
his
chamber
,
apparently
buried
in
the
profoundest
meditation
.
    
Chapter

<EOS>
In
which
Mr
Samuel
Weller
begins
to
devote
his
energies
to
the
return
match
between
himself
and
Mr
Trotter
 
<EOS>
In
a
small
room
in
the
vicinity
of
the
stableyard
,
betimes
in
the
morning
,
which
was
ushered
in
by
Mr
Pickwick
's
adventure
with
the
middle
---
aged
lady
in
the
yellow
curl
-
papers
,
sat
Mr
Weller
,
senior
,
preparing
himself
for
his
journey
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
in
an
excellent
attitude
for
having
his
portrait
taken
;
and
here
it
is
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
very
possible
that
at
some
earlier
period
of
his
career
,
Mr
Weller
's
profile
might
have
presented
a
bold
and
determined
outline
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
,
however
,
had
expanded
under
the
influence
of
good
living
,
and
a
disposition
remarkable
for
resignation
;
and
its
bold
,
fleshy
curves
had
so
far
extended
beyond
the
limits
originally
assigned
them
,
that
unless
you
took
a
full
view
of
his
countenance
in
front
,
it
was
difficult
to
distinguish
more
than
the
extreme
tip
of
a
very
rubicund
nose
.
 
<EOS>
His
chin
,
from
the
same
cause
,
had
acquired
the
grave
and
imposing
form
which
is
generally
described
by
prefixing
the
word
"
double
"
to
that
expressive
feature
;
and
his
complexion
exhibited
that
peculiarly
mottled
combination
of
colours
which
is
only
to
be
seen
in
gentlemen
of
his
profession
,
and
in
underdone
roast
beef
.
 
<EOS>
Round
his
neck
<EOS>
he
wore
a
crimson
travelling
-
shawl
,
which
merged
into
his
chin
by
such
imperceptible
gradations
,
that
it
was
difficult
to
distinguish
the
folds
of
the
one
,
from
the
folds
of
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Over
this
,
he
mounted
a
long
waistcoat
of
a
broad
pink
-
striped
pattern
,
and
over
that
again
,
a
wide
-
skirted
green
coat
,
ornamented
with
large
brass
buttons
,
whereof
the
two
which
garnished
the
waist
,
were
so
far
apart
,
that
no
man
had
ever
beheld
them
both
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
His
hair
,
which
was
short
,
sleek
,
and
black
,
was
just
visible
beneath
the
capacious
brim
of
a
low
-
crowned
brown
hat
.
 
<EOS>
His
legs
were
encased
in
knee
-
cord
breeches
,
and
painted
top
-
boots
;
and
a
copper
watch
-
chain
,
terminating
in
one
seal
,
and
a
key
of
the
same
material
,
dangled
loosely
from
his
capacious
waistband
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
said
that
Mr
Weller
was
engaged
in
preparing
for
his
journey
to
London
---
he
was
taking
sustenance
,
in
fact
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
table
before
him
,
stood
a
pot
of
ale
,
a
cold
round
of
beef
,
and
a
very
respectable
-
looking
loaf
,
to
each
of
which
he
distributed
his
favours
in
turn
,
with
the
most
rigid
impartiality
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
just
cut
a
mighty
slice
from
the
latter
,
when
the
footsteps
of
somebody
entering
the
room
,
caused
him
to
raise
his
head
;
and
he
beheld
his
son
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mornin
'
,
Sammy
!
"
said
the
father
.
   
<EOS>
The
son
walked
up
to
the
pot
of
ale
,
and
nodding
significantly
to
his
parent
,
took
a
long
draught
by
way
of
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
good
power
o
'
suction
,
Sammy
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
the
elder
,
looking
into
the
pot
,
when
his
first
-
born
had
set
it
down
half
empty
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'd
ha
'
made
an
uncommon
fine
oyster
,
Sammy
,
if
you
'd
been
born
in
that
station
o
'
life
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
des
-
say
,
I
should
ha
'
managed
to
pick
up
a
respectable
livin
'
,
"
replied
Sam
applying
himself
to
the
cold
beef
,
with
considerable
vigour
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
wery
sorry
,
Sammy
,
"
said
the
elder
Mr
Weller
,
shaking
up
the
ale
,
by
describing
small
circles
with
the
pot
,
preparatory
to
drinking
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
wery
sorry
,
Sammy
,
to
hear
from
your
lips
,
as
you
let
yourself
be
gammoned
by
that
'
ere
mulberry
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
thought
,
up
to
three
days
ago
,
that
the
names
of
Veller
and
gammon
could
never
come
into
contract
,
Sammy
,
never
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Always
exceptin
'
the
case
of
a
widder
,
of
course
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Widders
,
Sammy
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
,
slightly
changing
colour
.
 
<EOS>
"
Widders
are
'
ceptions
to
ev'ry
rule
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heerd
how
many
ordinary
women
<EOS>
one
widder
's
equal
to
in
pint
o
'
comin
'
over
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
's
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
but
<EOS>
I
do
n't
rightly
know
vether
it
ai
n't
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
;
that
's
pretty
well
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
"
continued
Mr
Weller
,
not
noticing
the
interruption
,
"
that
's
a
wery
different
thing
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
what
the
counsel
said
,
Sammy
,
as
defended
the
gen'l'm'n
as
beat
his
wife
with
the
poker
,
venever
he
got
jolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
arter
all
,
my
Lord
,
"
says
he
,
"
it
's
a
amiable
weakness
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
I
says
respectin
'
widders
,
Sammy
,
and
so
you
'll
say
,
ven
<EOS>
you
gets
as
old
as
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ought
to
ha
'
know'd
<EOS>
better
,
I
know
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ought
to
ha
'
know'd
better
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Mr
Weller
,
striking
the
table
with
his
fist
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ought
to
ha
'
<EOS>
know'd
<EOS>
better

<EOS>
why
,
I
know
a
young

un
as

your

as

who
'd

'
scorned
to
be
let
in
,
in
such
a
vay
;
scorned
it
,
Sammy
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
the
excitement
of
feeling
produced
by
this
agonising
reflection
,
Mr
Weller
rang
the
bell
,
and
ordered
an
additional
pint
of
ale
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
it
's
no
use
talking
about
it
now
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
over

and
ca

and
that
's
one
consolation

<EOS>
I
hope
you
will

"
returned
Mr
Weller
.
<EOS>
"
Here
's
your
health
,
Sammy
,
and
may
you
speedily
vipe
off
the
disgrace
as
you
've
inflicted
on
the
family
name

"
 
<EOS>
In
honour
of
this
toast
Mr
Weller
imbibed
at
a
draught
,
at
least
two
-
thirds
of
a
newly
-
arrived
pint
,
and
handed
it
over
to
his
son
,
to
dispose
of
the
remainder
,
which
he
instantaneously
did
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
Sammy
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
consulting
a
large
double
-
faced
silver
watch
that
hung
at
the
end
of
the
copper
chain
.
<EOS>
"
Now
it
's
time
I
was
up
at
the
office
to
get
my
vay
-
bill
and
see
the
coach
loaded
;
for
coaches
,
Sammy
,
is
like
guns
---
they
requires
to
be
loaded
with
wery
great
care
,
afore
they
go
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
parental
and
professional
joke
,
Mr
Weller
,
junior
,
smiled
a
filial
smile
.
 
<EOS>
His
revered
parent
continued
in
a
solemn
tone
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
-
goin
'
to
leave

Samivel
,

and

<EOS>
Your

The

Upon

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
these
affecting
words
,
Mr
Weller
looked
steadfastly
on
his
son
,
and
turning
slowly
upon
his
heel
,
disappeared
from
his
sight
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
contemplative
mood
which
these
words
had
awakened
,
Mr
Samuel
Weller
walked
forth
from
the
Great
White
Horse
when
his
father
had
left
him
;
and
bending
his
steps
towards
St
Clement
's
Church
,
endeavoured
to
dissipate
his
melancholy
,
by
strolling
among
its
ancient
precincts
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
loitered
about
,
for
some
time
,
when
he
found
himself
in
a
retired
spot
---
a
kind
of
courtyard
of
venerable
appearance
---
which
he
discovered
had
no
other
outlet
than
the
turning
by
which
he
had
entered
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
about
retracing
his
steps
,
when
he
was
suddenly
transfixed
to
the
spot
by
a
sudden
appearance
;
and
the
mode
and
manner
of
this
appearance
,
we
now
proceed
to
relate
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Samuel
Weller
had
been
staring
up
at
the
old
brick
houses
now
and
<EOS>
then
,
in
his
deep
abstraction
,
bestowing
a
wink
upon
some
healthy
-
looking
servant
girl
as
she
drew
up
a
blind
,
or
threw
open
a
bedroom
window
,
when
the
green
gate
of
a
garden
at
the
bottom
of
the
yard
opened
,
and
a
man
having
emerged
therefrom
,
closed
the
green
gate
very
carefully
after
him
,
and
walked
briskly
towards
the
very
spot
where
Mr
Weller
was
standing
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
taking
this
,
as
an
isolated
fact
,
unaccompanied
by
any
attendant
circumstances
,
there
was
nothing
very
extraordinary
in
it
;
because
in
many
parts
of
the
world
men
do
come
out
of
gardens
,
close
green
gates
after
them
,
and
even
walk
briskly
away
,
without
attracting
any
particular
share
of
public
observation
.
<EOS>
It
is
clear
,
therefore
,
that
there
must
have
been
something
in
the
man
,
or
in
his
manner
,
or
both
,
to
attract
Mr
Weller
's
particular
notice
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
there
was
,
or
not
,
we
must
leave
the
reader
to
determine
,
when
we
have
faithfully
recorded
the
behaviour
of
the
individual
in
question
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
man
had
shut
the
green
gate
after
him
,
he
walked
,
as
we
have
said
twice
already
,
with
a
brisk
pace
up
the
courtyard
;
but
he
no
sooner
caught
sight
of
Mr
Weller
than
he
faltered
,
and
stopped
,
as
if
uncertain
,
for
the
moment
,
what
course
to
adopt
.
<EOS>
As
the
green
gate
was
closed
behind
him
,
and
there
was
no
other
outlet
but
the
one
in
front
,
however
,
he
was
not
long
in
perceiving
that
he
must
pass
Mr
Samuel
Weller
to
get
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
resumed
his
brisk
pace
,
and
advanced
,
staring
straight
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
most
extraordinary
thing
about
the
man
was
,
that
he
was
contorting
his
face
into
the
most
fearful
and
astonishing
grimaces
that
ever
were
beheld
.
 
<EOS>
Nature
's
handiwork
never
was
disguised
with
such
extraordinary
artificial
carving
,
as
the
man
had
overlaid
his
countenance
with
in
one
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Mr
Weller
to
himself
,
as
the
man
approached
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
wery
odd
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
ha
'
swore
it
was
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Up
came
the
man
,
and
his
face
became
more
frightfully
distorted
than
ever
,
as
he
drew
nearer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
take
my
oath
to
that
'
ere
black
hair
and
mulberry
suit
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
;
"
only
I
never
see
such
a
face
as
that
afore
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Weller
said
this
,
the
man
's
features
assumed
an
unearthly
twinge
,
perfectly
hideous
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
obliged
to
pass
very
near
Sam
,
however
,
and
the
scrutinising
glance
of
that
gentleman
enabled
him
to
detect
,
under
all
these
appalling
twists
of
feature
,
something
too
like
the
small
eyes
of
Mr
Job
Trotter
to
be
easily
mistaken
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
,
you
Sir
!
"
shouted
Sam
fiercely
.
   
<EOS>
The
stranger
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Sam
,
still
more
gruffly
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
with
the
horrible
face
looked
,
with
the
greatest
surprise
,
up
the
court
,
and
down
the
court
,
and
in
at
the
windows
of
the
houses
---
everywhere
but
at
Sam
Weller
---
and
took
another
step
forward
,
when
he
was
brought
to
again
by
another
shout
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
,
you
sir
!
"
said
Sam
,
for
the
third
time
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
pretending
to
mistake
where
the
voice
came
from
now
,
so
the
stranger
,
having
no
other
resource
,
at
last
looked
Sam
Weller
full
in
the
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
do
,
Job
Trotter
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
!
 
<EOS>
None
o
'
<EOS>
that
'
ere
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
You
ai
n't
so
wery
"
<EOS>
andsome
that
you
can
afford
to
throw
avay
<EOS>
many
o
'
your
good
looks
.
 
<EOS>
Bring
them
'
ere
<EOS>
eyes
<EOS>
o
'
yourn
back
into
their
proper
places
,
or
<EOS>
I
'll
knock
'em
out
of
your
head
.
 
<EOS>
D'ye
hear
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Weller
appeared
fully
disposed
to
act
up
to
the
spirit
of
this
address
,
Mr
Trotter
gradually
allowed
his
face
to
resume
its
natural
expression
;
and
then
giving
a
start
of
joy
,
exclaimed
,
"
What
do
I
see
?
 
<EOS>
Mr
Walker
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
wery
glad
to
see
me
,
ai
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Glad
!
"
exclaimed
Job
Trotter
;
"
oh
,
Mr
Walker
,
if
you
had
but
known
how
I
have
looked
forward
to
this
meeting
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
too
much
,
Mr
Walker
;
I
can
not
bear
it
,
indeed
I
can
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
these
words
,
Mr
Trotter
burst
into
a
regular
inundation
of
tears
,
and
,
flinging
his
arms
around
those
of
Mr
Weller
,
embraced
him
closely
,
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Get
off
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sam
,
indignant
at
this
process
,
and
vainly
endeavouring
to
extricate
himself
from
the
grasp
of
his
enthusiastic
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Get
off
,
I
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
crying
over
me
for
,
you
portable
engine
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
I
am
so
glad
to
see
you
,
"
replied
Job
Trotter
,
gradually
releasing
Mr
Weller
,
as
the
first
symptoms
of
his
pugnacity
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr
Walker
,
this
is
too
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Too
much
!
"
echoed
Sam
,
"
I
think
it
is
too
much
---
rayther
!
<EOS>
Now
,
what
have
you
got
to
say
to
me
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Trotter
made
no
reply
;
for
the
little
pink
pocket
-
handkerchief
was
in
full
force
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
got
to
say
to
me
,
afore
<EOS>
I
knock
your
head
off
?
"
repeated
Mr
Weller
,
in
a
threatening
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Eh
!
"
said
Mr
Trotter
,
with
a
look
of
virtuous
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
got
to
say
to
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
,
Mr
Walker
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
call
me
Valker
;
my
name
's
Veller
;
you
know
that
vell
enough
.
 
<EOS>
What
have
you
got
to
say
to
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
,
Mr
Walker
---
<EOS>
Weller
,
I
mean
---
a
great
many
things
,
if
you
will
come
away
somewhere
,
where
we
can
talk
comfortably
.
<EOS>
If
you
knew
how
I
have
looked
for
you
,
Mr
Weller
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Wery
hard
,
indeed
,
I
s'pose
?
<EOS>
"
said
Sam
drily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
,
very
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Trotter
,
without
moving
a
muscle
of
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
shake
hands
,
Mr
Weller
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sam
eyed
his
companion
for
a
few
seconds
,
and
then
,
as
if
actuated
by
a
sudden
impulse
,
complied
with
his
request
.
<EOS>
"
How
,
"
said
Job
Trotter
,
as
they
walked
away
,
<EOS>
"
how
is
your
dear
,
good
master
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
he
is
a
worthy
gentleman
,
Mr
Weller
!
<EOS>
I
hope
he
did
n't
catch
cold
,
that
dreadful
night
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
momentary
look
of
deep
slyness
in
Job
Trotter
's
eye
,
as
he
said
this
,
which
ran
a
thrill
through
Mr
Weller
's
clenched
fist
,
as
he
burned
with
a
desire
to
make
a
demonstration
on
his
ribs
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
constrained
himself
,
however
,
and
replied
that
his
master
was
extremely
well
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
am
so
glad
,
"
replied
Mr
Trotter
;
"
is
he
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
yourn
?
"
asked
Sam
,
by
way
of
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
,
he
is
here
,
and
I
grieve
to
say
,
Mr
Weller
,
he
is
going
on
worse
than
ever
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
ah
!
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
shocking
---
terrible
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
a
boarding
-
school
?
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
at
a
boarding
-
school
,
"
replied
Job
Trotter
,
with
the
same
sly
look
which
Sam
had
noticed
before
;
"
not
at
a
boarding
-
school
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
the
house
with
the
green
gate
?
"
said
Sam
,
eyeing
his
companion
closely
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
---
<EOS>
oh
,
not
there
,
"
replied
Job
,
with
a
quickness
very
unusual
to
him
,
"
not
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
was
you
a
-
doin
'
there
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Sam
,
with
a
sharp
glance
.
<EOS>
"
Got
inside
the
gate
by
accident
,
perhaps
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
replied
Job
,
"
I
do
n't
mind
telling
you
my
little
secrets
,
because
,
you
know
,
we
took
such
a
fancy
for
each
other
when
we
first
met
.
 
<EOS>
You
recollect
how
pleasant
we
were
that
morning
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
said
Sam
,
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
remember
.
 
<EOS>
Well
?
"
   
"
Well
,
"
replied
Job
,
speaking
with
great
precision
,
and
in
the
low
tone
of
a
man
who
communicates
an
important
secret
;
"
in
that
house
with
the
green
gate
,
Mr
Weller
,
they
keep
a
good
many
servants
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
I
should
think
,
from
the
look
on
it
,
"
interposed
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
continued
Mr
Trotter
,
"
and
one
of
them
is
a
cook
,
who
has
saved
up
a
little
money
,
Mr
Weller
,
and
is
desirous
,
if
she
can
establish
herself
in
life
,
to
open
a
little
shop
in
the
chandlery
way
,
you
see
.
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Sir
,
I
met
her
at
a
chapel
that
I
go
to
;
a
very
neat
little
chapel
in
this
town
,
Mr
Weller
,
where
they
sing
the
number
four
collection
of
hymns
,
which
I
generally
carry
about
with
me
,
in
a
little
book
,
which
you
may
perhaps
have
seen
in
my
hand
---
and
I
got
a
little
intimate
with
her
,
Mr
Weller
,
and
from
that
,
an
acquaintance
sprung
up
between
us
,
and
I
may
venture
to
say
,
Mr
Weller
,
that
I
am
to
be
the
chandler
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
and
a
wery
amiable
chandler
you
'll
make
,
"
replied
Sam
,
eyeing
Job
with
a
side
look
of
intense
dislike
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
great
advantage
of
this
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
continued
Job
,
<EOS>
his
eyes
filling
with
tears
as
he
spoke
,
"
will
be
,
that
I
shall
be
able
to
leave
my
present
disgraceful
service
with
that
bad
man
,
and
to
devote
myself
to
a
better
and
more
virtuous
life
;
more
like
the
way
in
which
I
was
brought
up
,
Mr
Weller
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
ha
'
been
wery
nicely
brought
up

"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
very
,
Mr
Weller
,
very
,
"
replied
Job
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
recollection
of
the
purity
of
his
youthful
days
,
Mr
Trotter
pulled
forth
the
pink
handkerchief
,
and
wept
copiously
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
ha
'
been
an
uncommon
nice
boy
,
to
go
to
school
vith

"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
,
sir
,
"
replied
Job
,
heaving
a
deep
sigh
;
"
I
was
the
idol
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
I
do
n't
wonder
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
comfort
you
must
ha
'
been
to
your
blessed
mother
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
these
words
,
Mr
Job
Trotter
inserted
an
end
of
the
pink
handkerchief
into
the
corner
of
each
eye
,
one
after
the
other
,
and
began
to
weep
copiously
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wot
's
the
matter
with
the
man

"
said
Sam
,
indignantly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Chelsea

What

<EOS>
"
I

my
feelings
down

Mr

said
Job
,
after
a
short
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
think
that
my
master
should
have
suspected
the
conversation
I
had
with
yours

and
so
dragged
me
away
in
a
post

chaise

and
after
persuading
the
sweet
young

to
say
she
knew
nothing
of

bribing
the

mistress

do

deserted
her

<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
Mr

it

<EOS>
"
Oh

said
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
be

it

replied
Job
.
   
<EOS>
"
Vell

said
Sam
,
as
they
had
now
arrived
near
the
hotel

<EOS>

Job

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes

Sam
,
with
a
very

look

perhaps

<EOS>
"
I

said
Mr

;
and
wringing
Sam
's
hand
with
the
utmost
fervour

he
walked
away

<EOS>
"
Take

Sam

looking

"
 
<EOS>
Having
uttered
this
soliloquy
,
and
looked
after
Job
till
he
was
to
be
seen
no
more
,
Mr
Weller
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
his
master

bedroom

It

What

inquired
Mr
Pickwick

<EOS>
"
I

Sam

<EOS>
where

"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush

"
<EOS>
replied
Mr
Weller
;
and
as
he
assisted
Mr
Pickwick
to
dress
,
he
detailed
the
plan
of
action
on
which
he
proposed
to
enter
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
when
is
this
to

Mr

<EOS>
"
All

Chapter

<EOS>
Wherein
Mr
Peter
Magnus
grows
jealous
,
and
the
middle
-
aged
lady
apprehensive
,
which
brings
the
Pickwickians
within
the
grasp
of
the
Law
 
<EOS>
When
Mr
Pickwick
descended
to
the
room
in
which
he
and
Mr
Peter
Magnus
had
spent
the
preceding
evening
,
he
found
that
gentleman
with
the
major
part
of
the
contents
of
the
two
bags
,
the
leathern
hat
-
box
,
and
the
brown
-
paper
parcel
,
displaying
to
all
possible
advantage
on
his
person
,
while
he
himself
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
in
a
state
of
the
utmost
excitement
and
agitation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
morning
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Peter
Magnus
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
this
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
effective
indeed
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
surveying
the
garments
of
Mr
Peter
Magnus
with
a
good
-
natured
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
think
it
'll
do
,
"
said
Mr
Magnus
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pickwick
,
Sir
,
I
have
sent
up
my
card
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
waiter
brought
back
word
,
that
she
would
see
me
at
eleven
---
at
eleven
,
Sir
<EOS>
;
it
only
wants
a
quarter
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
near
the
time

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
is
rather
near
,
"
replied
Mr
Magnus
,
"
rather
too
near
to
be
pleasant
---
eh
!
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Confidence
is
a
great
thing
in
these
cases
,
"
observed
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
is
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Peter
Magnus
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
confident
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
Really
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
I
do
not
see
why
a
man
should
feel
any
fear
in
such
a
case
as
this
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
,
Sir
?
 
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
;
it
's
a
matter
of
mutual
accommodation
,
nothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
Husband
on
one
side
,
wife
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
my
view
of
the
matter
,
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
very
philosophical
one
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
breakfast
is
waiting
,
Mr
Magnus
.
 
<EOS>
Come
.
"
   
<EOS>
Down
<EOS>
they
sat
to
breakfast
,
but
it
was
evident
,
notwithstanding
the
boasting
of
Mr
Peter
Magnus
,
that
he
laboured
under
a
very
considerable
degree
of
nervousness
,
of
which
loss
of
appetite
,
a
propensity
to
upset
the
tea
-
things
,
a
spectral
attempt
at
drollery
,
and
an
irresistible
inclination
to
look
at
the
clock
,
<EOS>
every
other
second
,
were
among
the
principal
symptoms
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
-
he
<EOS>
-
he
,
"
tittered
Mr
Magnus
,
affecting
cheerfulness
,
and
gasping
with
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
only
wants
two
minutes
,
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
Am
I
pale
,
Sir
?
"
<EOS>
"
Not
very
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
brief
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr
Pickwick
;
but
have
you
ever
done
this
sort
of
thing
in
your
time
?
"
said
Mr
Magnus
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
mean
proposing
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
great
energy
,
"
never
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
idea
,
then
,
how
it
's
best
to
begin
?
"
said
Mr
Magnus
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
I
may
have
formed
some
ideas
upon
the
subject
,
but
,
as
I
have
never
submitted
them
to
the
test
of
experience
,
I
should
be
sorry
if
you
were
induced
to
regulate
your
proceedings
by
them
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
feel
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
for
any
advice
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Magnus
,
taking
another
look
at
the
clock
,
the
hand
of
which
was
verging
on
the
five
minutes
past
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
the
profound
solemnity
with
which
that
great
man
could
,
when
he
pleased
,
render
his
remarks
so
deeply
impressive
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
commence
,
sir
,
with
a
tribute
to
the
lady
's
beauty
and
excellent
qualities
;
from
them
,
Sir
,
I
should
diverge
to
my
own
unworthiness
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
said
Mr
Magnus
.
   
<EOS>
"
Unworthiness
for
HER
only
,
mind
,
sir
,
"
resumed
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
for
to
show
that
I
was
not
wholly
unworthy
,
sir
,
I
should
take
a
brief
review
of
my
past
life
,
and
present
condition
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
argue
,
by
analogy
,
that
to
anybody
else
,
I
must
be
a
very
desirable
object
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
then
expatiate
on
the
warmth
of
my
love
,
and
the
depth
of
my
devotion
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
might
then
be
tempted
to
seize
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
see
,
"
said
Mr
Magnus
;
"
that
would
be
a
very
great
point
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
then
,
Sir
,
"
continued
Mr
Pickwick
,
growing
warmer
as
the
subject
presented
itself
in
more
glowing
colours
before
him
---
<EOS>
"
I
should
then
,
Sir
,
come
to
the
plain
and
simple
question
,
"
Will
you
have
me
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
am
justified
in
assuming
that
upon
this
,
she
would
turn
away
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
think
that
may
be
taken
for
granted
?
"
said
Mr
Magnus
;
"
because
,
if
she
did
not
do
that
at
the
right
place
,
it
would
be
embarrassing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
would
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Upon
this
,
sir
,
I
should
squeeze
her
hand
,
and
I
think
---
<EOS>
I
think
,
<EOS>
Mr
Magnus
---
that
after
I
had
done
that
,
supposing
there
was
no
refusal
,
I
should
gently
draw
away
the
handkerchief
,
which
my
slight
knowledge
of
human
nature
leads
me
to
suppose
the
lady
would
be
applying
to
her
eyes
at
the
moment
,
and
steal
a
respectful
kiss
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
kiss
her
,
Mr
Magnus
;
and
at
this
particular
point
,
I
am
decidedly
of
opinion
that
if
the
lady
were
going
to
take
me
at
all
,
she
would
murmur
into
my
ears
a
bashful
acceptance
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Magnus
started
;
gazed
on
Mr
Pickwick
's
intelligent
face
,
for
a
short
time
in
silence
;
and
then
(
the
dial
pointing
to
the
ten
minutes
past
)
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
,
and
rushed
desperately
from
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
had
taken
a
few
strides
to
and
fro
;
and
the
small
hand
of
the
clock
following
the
latter
part
of
his
example
,
had
arrived
at
the
figure
which
indicates
the
half
-
hour
,
when
the
door
suddenly
opened
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
round
to
meet
Mr
Peter
Magnus
,
and
encountered
,
in
his
stead
,
the
joyous
face
of
Mr
Tupman
,
the
serene
countenance
of
Mr
Winkle
,
and
the
intellectual
lineaments
of
Mr
Snodgrass
.
 
<EOS>
As
Mr
Pickwick
greeted
them
,
Mr
Peter
Magnus
tripped
into
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
friends
,
the
gentleman
I
was
speaking
of
---
Mr
Magnus
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
servant
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Mr
Magnus
,
evidently
in
a
high
state
of
excitement
;
"
Mr
Pickwick
,
allow
me
to
speak
to
you
one
moment
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
,
Mr
Magnus
harnessed
his
forefinger
to
Mr
Pickwick
's
buttonhole
,
and
,
drawing
him
to
a
window
recess
,
said
---
   
"
<EOS>
Congratulate
me
,
Mr
Pickwick
;
I
followed
your
advice
to
the
very
letter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
it
was
all
correct
,
was
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
Could
not
possibly
have
been
better

"
replied
Mr
Magnus
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pickwick
,
she
is
mine

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
congratulate
you
,
with
all
my
heart

"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
warmly
shaking
his
new
friend
by
the
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Magnus
;
"
this
way
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
Excuse
us
for
one
instant
,
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Hurrying
on
in
this
way
,
Mr
Peter
Magnus
drew
Mr
Pickwick
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
paused
at
the
next
door
in
the
passage
,
and
tapped
gently
thereat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
"
said
a
female
voice
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
they
went
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Witherfield
,
"
said
Mr
Magnus
,
"
allow
me
to
introduce

<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
I
beg
to
make
you
known
to
Miss
Witherfield
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
lady
was
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
As
Mr
Pickwick
bowed
,
he
took
his
spectacles
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
and
put
them
on
;
a
process
which
he
had
no
sooner
gone
through
,
than
,
uttering
an
exclamation
of
surprise
,
Mr
Pickwick
retreated
several
paces
,
and
the
lady
,
with
a
half
-
suppressed
scream
,
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
,
and
dropped
into
a
chair
;
whereupon
Mr
Peter
Magnus
was
stricken
motionless
on
the
spot
,
and
gazed
from
one
to
the
other
,
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
the
extremities
of
horror
and
surprise
.
<EOS>
This
certainly
was
,
to
all
appearance
,
very
unaccountable
behaviour
;
but
the
fact
is
,
that
Mr
Pickwick
no
sooner
put
on
his
spectacles
,
than
he
at
once
recognised
in
the
future
<EOS>
Mrs
Magnus
the
lady
into
whose
room
he
had
so
unwarrantably
intruded
on
the
previous
night
;
and
the
spectacles
had
no
sooner
crossed
Mr
Pickwick
's
nose
,
than
the
lady
at
once
identified
the
countenance
which
she
had
seen
surrounded
by
all
the
horrors
of
a
nightcap
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
lady
screamed
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
started
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pickwick
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mr
Magnus
,
lost
in
astonishment
,
"
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
,
Sir
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
meaning
of
it
,
Sir
?
"
added
Mr
Magnus
,
in
a
threatening
,
and
a
louder
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
somewhat
indignant
at
the
very
sudden
manner
in
which
Mr
Peter
Magnus
had
conjugated
himself
into
the
imperative
mood
,
"
I
decline
answering
that
question
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
decline
it
,
Sir
?
"
said
Mr
Magnus
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
I
object
to
say
anything
which
may
compromise
that
lady
,
or
awaken
unpleasant
recollections
in
her
breast
,
without
her
consent
and
permission
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Witherfield
,
"
said
Mr
Peter
Magnus
,
"
do
you
know
this
person
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Know
him
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
the
middle
-
aged
lady
,
hesitating
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
know
him
,
ma'am
;
I
said
know
him
,
"
replied
Mr
Magnus
,
with
ferocity
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
him
,
"
replied
the
middle
-
aged
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
inquired
Mr
Magnus
,
"
<EOS>
where
?
"
   
"
That
,
"
said
the
middle
-
aged
lady
,
rising
from
her
seat
,
and
averting
her
head
---
"
that
I
would
not
reveal
for
worlds
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
and
respect
your
delicacy
;
it
shall
never
be
revealed
by
ME
depend
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Magnus
,
"
<EOS>
considering
the
situation
in
which
I
am
placed
with
regard
to
yourself
,
you
carry
this
matter
off
with
tolerable
coolness
---
tolerable
coolness
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cruel
Mr
Magnus
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
middle
-
aged
lady
;
here
she
wept
very
copiously
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Address
your
observations
to
me
,
sir
,
"
interposed
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
I
alone
am
to
blame
,
if
anybody
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
alone
are
to
blame
,
are
you
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Magnus
;
"
I
---
<EOS>
I
---
see
through
this
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
repent
of
your
determination
now
,
do
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
determination
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
determination
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
do
n't
stare
at
me
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Magnus
;
<EOS>
"
I
recollect
your
words
last
night
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
came
down
here
,
sir
,
to
expose
the
treachery
and
falsehood
of
an
individual
on
whose
truth
and
honour
you
had
placed
implicit
reliance
---
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Peter
Magnus
indulged
in
a
prolonged
sneer
;
and
taking
off
his
green
spectacles
---
which
he
probably
found
superfluous
in
his
fit
of
jealousy
---
rolled
his
little
eyes
about
,
in
a
manner
frightful
to
behold
.
   
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
"
said
Mr
Magnus
;
and
then
he
repeated
the
sneer
with
increased
effect
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
shall
answer
it
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Answer
what
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Magnus
,
striding
up
and
down
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
must
be
something
very
comprehensive
in
this
phrase
of
"
Never
mind
,
"
for
we
do
not
recollect
to
have
ever
witnessed
a
quarrel
in
the
street
,
at
a
theatre
,
public
room
,
or
elsewhere
,
in
which
it
has
not
been
the
standard
reply
to
all
belligerent
inquiries
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
call
yourself
a
gentleman
,
sir
?
"
---
"
Never
mind
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
I
offer
to
say
anything
to
the
young
woman
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
---
"
Never
mind
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
want
your
head
knocked
up
against
that
wall
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
---
"
Never
mind
,
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
is
observable
,
too
,
that
there
would
appear
to
be
some
hidden
taunt
in
this
universal
"
Never
mind
,
"
which
rouses
more
indignation
in
the
bosom
of
the
individual
addressed
,
than
the
most
lavish
abuse
could
possibly
awaken
.
   
<EOS>
We
do
not
mean
to
assert
that
the
application
of
this
brevity
to
himself
,
struck
exactly
that
indignation
to
Mr
Pickwick
's
soul
,
which
it
would
infallibly
have
roused
in
a
vulgar
breast
.
<EOS>
We
merely
record
the
fact
that
Mr
Pickwick
opened
the
room
door
,
and
abruptly
called
out
,
"
Tupman
,
come
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
immediately
presented
himself
,
with
a
look
of
very
considerable
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tupman
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
a
secret
of
some
delicacy
,
in
which
that
lady
is
concerned
,
is
the
cause
of
a
difference
which
has
just
arisen
between
this
gentleman
and
myself
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
assure
him
,
in
your
presence
,
that
it
has
no
relation
to
himself
,
and
is
not
in
any
way
connected
with
his
affairs
,
I
need
hardly
beg
you
to
take
notice
that
if
he
continue
to
dispute
it
,
he
expresses
a
doubt
of
my
veracity
,
which
I
shall
consider
extremely
insulting
.
"
<EOS>
As
Mr
Pickwick
said
this
,
he
looked
encyclopedias
at
Mr
Peter
Magnus
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
upright
and
honourable
bearing
,
coupled
with
that
force
and
energy
of
speech
which
so
eminently
distinguished
him
,
would
have
carried
conviction
to
any
reasonable
mind
;
but
,
unfortunately
,
at
that
particular
moment
,
the
mind
of
Mr
Peter
Magnus
was
in
anything
but
reasonable
order
.
 
<EOS>
Consequently
,
instead
of
receiving
Mr
Pickwick
's
explanation
as
he
ought
to
have
done
,
he
forthwith
proceeded
to
work
himself
into
a
red
-
hot
,
scorching
,
consuming
passion
,
and
to
talk
about
what
was
due
to
his
own
feelings
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
;
adding
force
to
his
declamation
by
striding
to
and
fro
,
and
pulling
his
hair
---
amusements
which
he
would
vary
occasionally
,
by
shaking
his
fist
in
Mr
Pickwick
's
philanthropic
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
in
his
turn
,
conscious
of
his
own
innocence
and
rectitude
,
and
irritated
by
having
unfortunately
involved
the
middle
-
aged
lady
in
such
an
unpleasant
affair
,
was
not
so
quietly
disposed
as
was
his
wo
nt
.
 
<EOS>
The
consequence
was
,
that
words
ran
high
,
and
voices
higher
;
and
at
length
Mr
Magnus
told
Mr
Pickwick
he
should
hear
from
him
;
to
which
Mr
Pickwick
replied
,
with
laudable
politeness
,
that
the
sooner
he
heard
from
him
the
better
;
whereupon
the
middle
-
aged
lady
rushed
in
terror
from
the
room
,
out
of
which
Mr
Tupman
dragged
Mr
Pickwick
,
leaving
Mr
Peter
Magnus
to
himself
and
meditation
.
   
<EOS>
If
the
middle
-
aged
lady
had
mingled
much
with
the
busy
world
,
or
had
profited
at
all
by
the
manners
and
customs
of
those
who
make
the
laws
and
set
the
fashions
,
she
would
have
known
that
this
sort
of
ferocity
is
the
most
harmless
thing
in
nature
;
but
as
she
had
lived
for
the
most
part
in
the
country
,
and
never
read
the
parliamentary
debates
,
she
was
little
versed
in
these
particular
refinements
of
civilised
life
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
when
she
had
gained
her
bedchamber
,
bolted
herself
in
,
and
began
to
meditate
on
the
scene
she
had
just
witnessed
,
the
most
terrific
pictures
of
slaughter
and
destruction
presented
themselves
to
her
imagination
;
among
which
,
a
full
-
length
portrait
of
Mr
Peter
Magnus
borne
home
by
four
men
,
with
the
embellishment
of
a
whole
barrelful
of
bullets
in
his
left
side
,
was
among
the
very
least
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
the
middle
-
aged
lady
meditated
,
the
more
terrified
she
became
;
and
at
length
she
determined
to
repair
to
the
house
of
the
principal
magistrate
of
the
town
,
and
request
him
to
secure
the
persons
of
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Tupman
without
delay
.
   
<EOS>
To
this
decision
the
middle
-
aged
lady
was
impelled
by
a
variety
of
considerations
,
the
chief
of
which
was
the
incontestable
proof
it
would
afford
of
her
devotion
to
Mr
Peter
Magnus
,
and
her
anxiety
for
his
safety
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
too
well
acquainted
with
his
jealous
temperament
to
venture
the
slightest
allusion
to
the
real
cause
of
her
agitation
on
beholding
Mr
Pickwick
;
and
she
trusted
to
her
own
influence
and
power
of
persuasion
with
the
little
man
,
to
quell
his
boisterous
jealousy
,
supposing
that
Mr
Pickwick
were
removed
,
and
no
fresh
quarrel
could
arise
.
 
<EOS>
Filled
with
these
reflections
,
the
middle
-
aged
lady
arrayed
herself
in
her
bonnet
and
shawl
,
and
repaired
to
the
mayor
's
dwelling
straightway
.
   
<EOS>
Now
George
Nupkins
,
Esquire
,
the
principal
magistrate
aforesaid
,
was
as
grand
a
personage
as
the
fastest
walker
would
find
out
,
between
sunrise
and
sunset
,
on
the
twenty
-
first
of
June
,
which
being
,
according
to
the
almanacs
,
the
longest
day
in
the
whole
year
,
would
naturally
afford
him
the
longest
period
for
his
search
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
particular
morning
,
Mr
Nupkins
was
in
a
state
of
the
utmost
excitement
and
irritation
,
for
there
had
been
a
rebellion
in
the
town
;
all
the
day
-
scholars
at
the
largest
day
-
school
had
conspired
to
break
the
windows
of
an
obnoxious
apple
-
seller
,
and
had
hooted
the
beadle
and
pelted
the
constabulary
---
an
elderly
gentleman
in
top
-
boots
,
who
had
been
called
out
to
repress
the
tumult
,
and
who
had
been
a
peace
-
officer
,
man
and
boy
,
for
half
a
century
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mr
Nupkins
was
sitting
in
his
easy
-
chair
,
frowning
with
majesty
,
and
boiling
with
rage
,
when
a
lady
was
announced
on
pressing
,
private
,
and
particular
business
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Nupkins
looked
calmly
terrible
,
and
commanded
that
the
lady
should
be
shown
in
;
which
command
,
like
all
the
mandates
of
emperors
,
and
magistrates
,
and
other
great
potentates
of
the
earth
,
was
forthwith
obeyed
;
and
Miss
Witherfield
,
interestingly
agitated
,
was
ushered
in
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Muzzle
!
"
said
the
magistrate
.
   
<EOS>
Muzzle
was
an
undersized
footman
,
with
a
long
body
and
short
legs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Muzzle
!
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
your
Worship
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Place
a
chair
,
and
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
your
Worship
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
ma'am
,
will
you
state
your
business
?
"
said
the
magistrate
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
of
a
very
painful
kind
,
Sir
,
"
said
Miss
Witherfield
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
,
ma'am
,
"
said
the
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Compose
your
feelings
,
ma'am
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Nupkins
looked
benignant
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
then
tell
me
what
legal
business
brings
you
here
,
ma'am
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
the
magistrate
triumphed
over
the
man
;
and
he
looked
stern
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
distressing
to
me
,
Sir
,
to
give
this
information
,
"
said
Miss
Witherfield
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
fear
a
duel
is
going
to
be
fought
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
,
ma'am
?
"
said
the
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
,
ma'am
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
Ipswich
.
"
<EOS>
"
In
Ipswich
,
ma'am
!
 
<EOS>
A
duel
in
Ipswich
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
magistrate
,
perfectly
aghast
at
the
notion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Impossible
,
ma'am
;
nothing
of
the
kind
can
be
contemplated
in
this
town
,
I
am
persuaded
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
<EOS>
my
soul
,
ma'am
,
are
you
aware
of
the
activity
of
our
local
magistracy
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
happen
to
have
heard
,
ma'am
,
that
I
rushed
into
a
prize
-
ring
on
the
fourth
of
May
last
,
attended
by
only
sixty
special
constables
;
and
,
at
the
hazard
of
falling
a
sacrifice
to
the
angry
passions
of
an
infuriated
multitude
,
prohibited
a
pugilistic
contest
between
the
Middlesex
Dumpling
and
the
Suffolk
Bantam
?
 
<EOS>
A
duel
in
Ipswich
,
ma'am
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
---
I
do
not
think
,
"
said
the
magistrate
,
reasoning
with
himself
,
"
that
any
two
men
can
have
had
the
hardihood
to
plan
such
a
breach
of
the
peace
,
in
this
town
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
information
is
,
unfortunately
,
but
too
correct
,
"
said
the
middle
-
aged
lady
;
"
I
was
present
at
the
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
most
extraordinary
thing
,
"
said
the
astounded
magistrate
.
<EOS>
"
Muzzle
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
your

Muzzle
retired
;
and
a
pale
,
sharp
-
nosed
,
half
-
fed
,
shabbily
-
clad
clerk
,
of
middle
age
,
entered
the

Sir

said
Mr

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
lady
,
Mr
Jinks
,
has
come
here
,
to
give
information
of
an
intended
duel
in
this
town
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jinks
,
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
do
,
smiled
a
dependent
's
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
laughing
at
,
Mr
Jinks
?
"
said
the
magistrate
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jinks
looked
serious
instantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Jinks
,
"
said
the
magistrate
,
"
you
're
a
fool
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jinks
looked
humbly
at
the
great
man
,
and
bit
the
top
of
his
pen
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
see
something
very
comical
in
this
information
,
Sir
---
but
I
can
tell
you
this
,
Mr
Jinks
,
that
you
have
very
little
to
laugh
at
,
"
said
the
magistrate
.
   
<EOS>
The
hungry
-
looking
Jinks
sighed
,
as
if
he
were
quite
aware
of
the
fact
of
his
having
very
little
indeed
to
be
merry
about
;
and
,
being
ordered
to
take
the
lady
's
information
,
shambled
to
a
seat
,
and
proceeded
to
write
it
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
man
,
Pickwick
,
is
the
principal
,
I
understand
?
"
said
the
magistrate
,
when
the
statement
was
finished
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is

said
the
middle
-
aged
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And

"
Yes

The

absconded

"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes

"
replied
Miss
Witherfield
,
with
a
short
cough
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well

"
said
the
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
"
These
are
two
cut
-
throats
from
London

who
have
come
down
here
to
destroy
his
Majesty

population

thinking
that
at
this
distance
from
the
capital
,
the
arm
of
the
law
is
weak
and
paralysed
.
 
<EOS>
They
shall
be
made

<EOS>
The
obsequious
Muzzle
retired
,
and
presently
returned
,
introducing
the
elderly
gentleman
in
the
top
-
boots
,
who
was
chiefly
remarkable
for
a
bottle
-
nose
,
a
hoarse
voice

a
snuff

coloured
surtout

and
a
wandering
eye

Grummer

<EOS>
"
Nothing

vigorous
measures
will
do
in

Grummer
,

said
the
magistrate
,
in
a
determined
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
the
authority
of
the
king

officers
is
set

naught

we
must
have
the

<EOS>
If
the
civil
power
can
not
protect

Grummer
,
the
military
must
protect
the
civil
power

and
the
windows
too

<EOS>
I
believe
that
is
a
maxim
of
the
constitution

Mr
Jinks

"
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
sir

"
said
Jinks
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good

"
said
the
magistrate
,
signing
the
warrants

<EOS>
"
Grummer

you

bring

this

You
recollect

Middlesex

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grummer
intimated
,
by
a
retrospective
shake
of
the
head
,
that
he
should
never
forget
it
---
<EOS>
as
indeed
it
was
not
likely
he
would
,
so
long
as
it
continued
to
be
cited
daily
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
even
more
unconstitutional
,
"
said
the
magistrate
;
"
this
is
even
a
greater
breach
of
the
peace
,
and
a
grosser
infringement
of

Majesty

prerogative

<EOS>
I
believe
duelling

one

most
undoubted
prerogatives

"
Expressly
stipulated

said
Mr

<EOS>
Just

replied
Mr

<EOS>
"

the

himself
up
proudly

"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Witherfield
retired
,
deeply
impressed
with
the
magistrate
's
learning
and
research
;
Mr
Nupkins
retired
to
lunch
;
Mr
Jinks
retired
within
himself
---
that
being
the
only
retirement
he
had
,
except
the
sofa
-
bedstead
in
the
small
parlour
which
was
occupied
by
his
landlady
's
family
in
the
daytime
---
and
Mr
Grummer
retired
,
to
wipe
out
,
by
his
mode
of
discharging
his
present
commission
,
the
insult
which
had
been
fastened
upon
himself
,
and
the
other
representative
of
his
Majesty
---
the
beadle
 
---
in
the
course
of
the
morning
.
   
<EOS>
While
these
resolute
and
determined
preparations
for
the
conservation
of
the
king
's
peace
were
pending
,
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
friends
,
wholly
unconscious
of
the
mighty
events
in
progress
,
had
sat
quietly
down
to
dinner
;
and
very
talkative
and
companionable
they
all
were
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
in
the
very
act
of
relating
his
adventure
of
the
preceding
night
,
to
the
great
amusement
of
his
followers
,
Mr
Tupman
especially
,
when
the
door
opened
,
and
a
somewhat
forbidding
countenance
peeped
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
eyes
in
the
forbidding
countenance
looked
very
earnestly
at
Mr
Pickwick
,
for
several
seconds
,
and
were
to
all
appearance
satisfied
with
their
investigation
;
for
the
body
to
which
the
forbidding
countenance
belonged
,
slowly
brought
itself
into
the
apartment
,
and
presented
the
form
of
an
elderly
individual
in
top
-
boots
---
not
to
keep
the
reader
any
longer
in
suspense
,
in
short
,
the
eyes
were
the
wandering
eyes
of
Mr
Grummer
,
and
the
body
was
the
body
of
the
same
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grummer
's
mode
of
proceeding
was
professional
,
but
peculiar
.
 
<EOS>
His
first
act
was
to
bolt
the
door
on
the
inside
;
his
second
,
to
polish
his
head
and
countenance
very
carefully
with
a
cotton
handkerchief
;
his
third
,
to
place
his
hat
,
with
the
cotton
handkerchief
in
it
,
on
the
nearest
chair
;
and
his
fourth
,
to
produce
from
the
breast
-
pocket
of
his
coat
a
short
truncheon
,
surmounted
by
a
brazen
crown
,
with
which
he
beckoned
to
Mr
Pickwick
with
a
grave
and
ghost
-
like
air
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
was
the
first
to
break
the
astonished
silence
.
<EOS>
He
looked
steadily
at
Mr
Grummer
for
a
brief
space
,
and
then
said
emphatically
,
"
This
is
a
private
room
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
A
private
room
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grummer
shook
his
head
,
and
replied
,
"
<EOS>
No
room
's
private
to
his
Majesty
when
the
street
door
's
once
passed
.
 
<EOS>
That

<EOS>
Some
people
maintains
that
an
Englishman

<EOS>
That

<EOS>
The
Pickwickians
gazed
on
each
other
with
wondering
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Which
is
Mr
Tupman
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Grummer
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
an
intuitive
perception
of
Mr
Pickwick
;
he
knew
him
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
name

Tupman

said
that
gentleman
.

said
Mr

said
Mr

.
   
<EOS>
"

replied
Mr

<EOS>
"
What

said
Mr
Tupman
,
starting
up
;
"

the
room

"
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
,
"
said
Mr
Grummer
,
retreating
very
expeditiously
to
the
door
,
and
opening
it
an
inch
or
two
,
"
Dubbley
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well

said
a
deep
voice
from
the
passage
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
for'ard
,
Dubbley

"
   
<EOS>
At
the
word
of
command
,
a
dirty
-
faced
man
,
something
over
six
feet
high
,
and
stout
in
proportion
,
squeezed
himself
through
the
half
-
open
door
(
making
his
face
very
red
in
the
process
)
,
and
entered
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
the
other
specials
outside
,
Dubbley
?
"
inquired
Mr
Grummer
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dubbley
,
who
was
a
man
of
few
words
,
nodded
assent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Order
in
the
diwision
under
your
charge
,
Dubbley

"
said
Mr
Grummer
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dubbley
did
as
he
was
desired
;
and
half
a
dozen
men
,
each
with
a
short
truncheon
and
a
brass
crown
,
flocked
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mr
Grummer
pocketed
his
staff
,
and
looked
at
Mr
Dubbley
;
Mr
Dubbley
pocketed
his
staff
and
looked
at
the
division
;
the
division
pocketed
their
staves
and
looked
at
Messrs.
Tupman
and
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
followers
rose
as
one
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
meaning
of
this
atrocious
intrusion
upon
my
privacy
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
dares
apprehend
me
?
"
said
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
here
,
scoundrels
?
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
said
nothing
,
but
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
Grummer
,
and
bestowed
a
look
upon
him
,
which
,
if
he
had
had
any
feeling
,
must
have
pierced
his
brain
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
however
,
it
had
no
visible
effect
on
him
<EOS>
whatever
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
executive
perceived
that
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
friends
were
disposed
to
resist
the
authority
of
the
law
,
they
very
significantly
turned
up
their
coat
sleeves
,
as
if
knocking
them
down
in
the
first
instance
,
and
taking
them
up
afterwards
,
were
a
mere
professional
act
which
had
only
to
be
thought
of
to
be
done
,
as
a
matter
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
This
demonstration
was
not
lost
upon
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
He
conferred
a
few
moments
with
Mr
Tupman
apart
,
and
then
signified
his
readiness
to
proceed
to
the
mayor
's
residence
,
merely
begging
the
parties
then
and
there
assembled
,
to
take
notice
,
that
it
was
his
firm
intention
to
resent
this
monstrous
invasion
of
his
privileges
as
an
Englishman
,
the
instant
he
was
at
liberty
;
<EOS>
whereat
the
parties
then
and
there
assembled
laughed
very
heartily
,
with
the
single
exception
of
Mr
Grummer
,
who
seemed
to
consider
that
any
slight
cast
upon
the
divine
right
of
magistrates
was
a
species
of
blasphemy
not
to
be
tolerated
.
   
<EOS>
But
when
Mr
Pickwick
had
signified
his
readiness
to
bow
to
the
laws
of
his
country
,
and
just
when
the
waiters
,
and
hostlers
,
and
chambermaids
,
and
post
-
boys
,
who
had
anticipated
a
delightful
commotion
from
his
threatened
obstinacy
,
began
to
turn
away
,
disappointed
and
disgusted
,
a
difficulty
arose
which
had
not
been
foreseen
.
 
<EOS>
With
every
sentiment
of
veneration
for
the
constituted
authorities
,
Mr
Pickwick
resolutely
protested
against
making
his
appearance
in
the
public
streets
,
surrounded
and
guarded
by
the
officers
of
justice
,
like
a
common
criminal
.
<EOS>
Mr
Grummer
,
in
the
then
disturbed
state
of
public
feeling
(
for
it
was
half
-
holiday
,
and
the
boys
had
not
yet
gone
home
)
,
as
resolutely
protested
against
walking
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
,
and
taking
Mr
Pickwick
's
parole
that
he
would
go
straight
to
the
magistrate
's
;
and
both
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Tupman
as
strenuously
objected
to
the
expense
of
a
post
-
coach
,
which
was
the
only
respectable
conveyance
that
could
be
obtained
.
 
<EOS>
The
dispute
ran
high
,
and
the
dilemma
lasted
long
;
and
just
as
the
executive
were
on
the
point
of
overcoming
Mr
Pickwick
's
objection
to
walking
to
the
magistrate
's
,
by
the
trite
expedient
of
carrying
him
thither
,
it
was
recollected
that
there
stood
in
the
inn
yard
,
an
old
sedan
-
chair
,
which
,
having
been
originally
built
for
a
gouty
gentleman
with
funded
property
,
would
hold
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Tupman
,
at
least
as
conveniently
as
a
modern
post
-
chaise
.
<EOS>
The
chair
was
hired
,
and
brought
into
the
hall
;
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Tupman
squeezed
themselves
inside
,
and
pulled
down
the
blinds
;
a
couple
of
chairmen
were
speedily
found
;
and
the
procession
started
in
grand
order
.
 
<EOS>
The
specials
surrounded
the
body
of
the
vehicle
;
Mr
Grummer
and
Mr
Dubbley
marched
triumphantly
in
front
;
Mr
Snodgrass
and
Mr
Winkle
walked
arm

in

arm
behind
;
and
the
unsoaped
of
Ipswich
brought
up
the
rear
.
   
<EOS>
The
shopkeepers
of
the
town
,
although
they
had
a
very
indistinct
notion
of
the
nature
of
the
offence
,
could
not
but
be
much
edified
and
gratified
by
this
spectacle
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
the
strong
arm
of
the
law
,
coming
down
with
twenty
gold
-
beater
force
,
upon
two
offenders
from
the
metropolis
itself
;
the
mighty
engine
was
directed
by
their
own
magistrate
,
and
worked
by
their
own
officers
;
and
both
the
criminals
,
by
their
united
efforts
,
were
securely
shut
up
,
in
the
narrow
compass
of
one
sedan
-
chair
.
<EOS>
Many
were
the
expressions
of
approval
and
admiration
which
greeted
Mr
Grummer
,
as
he
headed
the
cavalcade
,
staff
in
hand
;
loud
and
long
were
the
shouts
raised
by
the
unsoaped
;
and
amidst
these
united
testimonials
of
public
approbation
,
the
procession
moved
slowly
and
majestically
along
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
,
habited
in
his
morning
jacket
,
with
the
black
calico
sleeves
,
was
returning
in
a
rather
desponding
state
from
an
unsuccessful
survey
of
the
mysterious
house
with
the
green
gate
,
when
,
raising
his
eyes
,
he
beheld
a
crowd
pouring
down
the
street
,
surrounding
an
object
which
had
very
much
the
appearance
of
a
sedan
-
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Willing
to
divert
his
thoughts
from
the
failure
of
his
enterprise
,
he
stepped
aside
to
see
the
crowd
pass
;
and
finding
that
they
were
cheering
away
,
very
much
to
their
own
satisfaction
,
forthwith
began
(
by
way
of
raising
his
spirits
)
to
cheer
too
,
with
all
his
might
and
main
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grummer
passed
,
and
Mr
Dubbley
passed
,
and
the
sedan
passed
,
and
the
bodyguard
of
specials
passed
,
and
Sam
was
still
responding
to
the
enthusiastic
cheers
of
the
mob
,
and
waving
his
hat
about
as
if
he
were
in
the
very
last
extreme
of
the
wildest
joy
(
though
,
of
course
,
he
had
not
the
faintest
idea
of
the
matter
in
hand
)
,
when
he
was
suddenly
stopped
by
the
unexpected
appearance
of
Mr
Winkle
and
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
row
,
gen'l'm'n
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
have
they
got
in
this
here
watch
-
box
in
mournin
'
?
"
   
<EOS>
Both
gentlemen
replied
together
,
but
their
words
were
lost
in
the
tumult
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Sam
again
.
   
<EOS>
once
more
was
a
joint
reply
returned
;
and
,
though
the
words
were
inaudible
,
Sam
saw
by
the
motion
of
the
two
pairs
of
lips
that
they
had
uttered
the
magic
word
"
Pickwick
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
enough
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
minute
Mr
Weller
had
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
,
stopped
the
chairmen
,
and
confronted
the
portly
Grummer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
,
old
gen'l'm'n
!
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
have
you
got
in
this
here
conweyance
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stand
back
,
"
said
Mr
Grummer
,
whose
dignity
,
like
the
dignity
of
a
great
many
other
men
,
had
been
wondrously
augmented
by
a
little
popularity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Knock
him
down
,
if
he
do
n't
,
"
said
Mr
Dubbley
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
wery
much
obliged
to
you
,
old
gen'l'm'n
,
"
replied
Sam
,
"
for
consulting
my
conwenience
,
and
I
'm
still
more
obliged
to
the
other
gen'l'm'n
,
who
looks
as
if
he
'd
just
escaped
from
a
giant
's
carrywan
,
for
his
wery
<EOS>
"
andsome
suggestion
;
but
I
should
prefer
your
givin
'
me
a
answer
to
my
question
,
if
it
's
all
the
same
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
---
How
are
you
,
Sir
?
"
 
<EOS>
This
last
observation
was
addressed
with
a
patronising
air
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
was
peeping
through
the
front
window
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grummer
,
perfectly
speechless
with
indignation
,
dragged
the
truncheon
with
the
brass
crown
from
its
particular
pocket
,
and
flourished
it
before
Sam
's
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
it
's
wery
pretty
,
"
specially
the
crown
,
which
is
uncommon
like
the
real
one
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stand
back
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
outraged
Mr
Grummer
.
 
<EOS>
By
way
of
adding
force
to
the
command
,
he
thrust
the
brass
emblem
of
royalty
into
Sam
's
neckcloth
with
one
hand
,
and
seized
Sam
's
collar
with
the
other
---
a
compliment
which
Mr
Weller
returned
by
knocking
him
down
out
of
hand
,
having
previously
with
the
utmost
consideration
,
knocked
down
a
chairman
for
him
to
lie
upon
.
   
<EOS>
Whether
Mr
Winkle
was
seized
with
a
temporary
attack
of
that
species
of
insanity
which
originates
in
a
sense
of
injury
,
or
animated
by
this
display
of
Mr
Weller
's
valour
,
is
uncertain
;
but
certain
it
is
,
that
he
no
sooner
saw
Mr
Grummer
fall
than
he
made
a
terrific
onslaught
on
a
small
boy
who
stood
next
him
;
whereupon
Mr
Snodgrass
,
in
a
truly
Christian
spirit
,
and
in
order
that
he
might
take
no
one
unawares
,
announced
in
a
very
loud
tone
that
he
was
going
to
begin
,
and
proceeded
to
take
off
his
coat
with
the
utmost
deliberation
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
immediately
surrounded
and
secured
;
and
it
is
but
common
justice
both
to
him
and
Mr
Winkle
to
say
,
that
they
did
not
make
the
slightest
attempt
to
rescue
either
themselves
or
Mr
Weller
;
who
,
after
a
most
vigorous
resistance
,
was
overpowered
by
numbers
and
taken
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
The
procession
then
reformed
;
the
chairmen
resumed
their
stations
;
and
the
march
was
re
-
commenced
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
indignation
during
the
whole
of
this
proceeding
was
beyond
all
bounds
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
just
see
Sam
upsetting
the
specials
,
and
flying
about
in
every
direction
;
and
that
was
all
he
could
see
,
for
the
sedan
doors
would
n't
open
,
and
the
blinds
would
n't
pull
up
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
with
the
assistance
of
Mr
Tupman
,
he
managed
to
push
open
the
roof
;
and
mounting
on
the
seat
,
and
steadying
himself
as
well
as
he
could
,
by
placing
his
hand
on
that
gentleman
's
shoulder
,
Mr
Pickwick
proceeded
to
address
the
multitude
;
to
dwell
upon
the
unjustifiable
manner
in
which
he
had
been
treated
;
and
to
call
upon
them
to
take
notice
that
his
servant
had
been
first
assaulted
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
order
they
reached
the
magistrate
's
house
;
the
chairmen
trotting
,
the
prisoners
following
,
Mr
Pickwick
oratorising
,
and
the
crowd
shouting
.
    
Chapter

<EOS>
Showing
,
among
a
variety
of
pleasant
matters
,
how
majestic
and
impartial
Mr
Nupkins
was
;
and
how
Mr
Weller
returned
 
<EOS>
Mr
Job
Trotter
's
shuttlecock
as
heavily
as
it
came
---
with
another
matter
,
which
will
be
found
in
its
place
 
<EOS>
Violent
was
Mr
Weller
's
indignation
as
he
was
borne
along
;
numerous
were
the
allusions
to
the
personal
appearance
and
demeanour
of
Mr
Grummer
and
his
companion
;
and
valorous
were
the
defiances
to
any
six
of
the
gentlemen
present
,
in
which
he
vented
his
dissatisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
and
Mr
Winkle
listened
with
gloomy
respect
to
the
torrent
of
eloquence
which
their
leader
poured
forth
from
the
sedan
-
chair
,
and
the
rapid
course
of
which
not
all
Mr
Tupman
's
earnest
entreaties
to
have
the
lid
of
the
vehicle
closed
,
were
able
to
check
for
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Weller
's
anger
quickly
gave
way
to
curiosity
when
the
procession
turned
down
the
identical
courtyard
in
which
he
had
met
with
the
runaway
Job
Trotter
;
and
curiosity
was
exchanged
for
a
feeling
of
the
most
gleeful
astonishment
,
when
the
all
-
important
Mr
Grummer
,
commanding
the
sedan
-
bearers
to
halt
,
advanced
with
dignified
and
portentous
steps
to
the
very
green
gate
from
which
Job
Trotter
had
emerged
,
and
gave
a
mighty
pull
at
the
bell
-
handle
which
hung
at
the
side
thereof
.
 
<EOS>
The
ring
was
answered
by
a
very
smart
and
pretty
-
faced
servant
-
girl
,
who
,
after
holding
up
her
hands
in
astonishment
at
the
rebellious
appearance
of
the
prisoners
,
and
the
impassioned
language
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
summoned
Mr
Muzzle
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Muzzle
opened
one
half
of
the
carriage
gate
,
to
admit
the
sedan
,
the
captured
ones
,
and
the
specials
;
and
immediately
slammed
it
in
the
faces
of
the
mob
,
who
,
indignant
at
being
excluded
,
and
anxious
to
see
what
followed
,
relieved
their
feelings
by
kicking
at
the
gate
and
ringing
the
bell
,
for
an
hour
or
two
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
amusement
they
all
took
part
by
turns
,
except
three
or
four
fortunate
individuals
,
who
,
having
discovered
a
grating
in
the
gate
,
which
commanded
a
view
of
nothing
,
stared
through
it
with
the
indefatigable
perseverance
with
which
people
will
flatten
their
noses
against
the
front
windows
of
a
chemist
's
shop
,
when
a
drunken
man
,
who
has
been
run
over
by
a
dog
-
cart
in
the
street
,
is
undergoing
a
surgical
inspection
in
the
back
-
parlour
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
foot
of
a
flight
of
steps
,
leading
to
the
house
door
,
which
was
guarded
on
either
side
by
an
American
aloe
in
a
green
tub
,
the
sedan
-
chair
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
friends
were
conducted
into
the
hall
,
whence
,
having
been
previously
announced
by
Muzzle
,
and
ordered
in
by
Mr
Nupkins
,
they
were
ushered
into
the
worshipful
presence
of
that
public
-
spirited
officer
.
   
<EOS>
The
scene
was
an
impressive
one
,
well
calculated
to
strike
terror
to
the
hearts
of
culprits
,
and
to
impress
them
with
an
adequate
idea
of
the
stern
majesty
of
the
law
.
 
<EOS>
In
front
of
a
big
book
-
case
,
in
a
big
chair
,
behind
a
big
table
,
and
before
a
big
volume
,
sat
Mr
Nupkins
,
looking
a
full
size
larger
than
any
one
of
them
,
big
as
they
were
.
 
<EOS>
The
table
was
adorned
with
piles
of
papers
;
and
above
the
farther
end
of
it
,
appeared
the
head
and
shoulders
of
Mr
Jinks
,
who
was
busily
engaged
in
looking
as
busy
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
The
party
having
all
entered
,
Muzzle
carefully
closed
the
door
,
and
placed
himself
behind
his
master
's
chair
to
await
his
orders
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Nupkins
threw
himself
back
with
thrilling
solemnity
,
and
scrutinised
the
faces
of
his
unwilling
visitors
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Grummer
,
who
is
that
person
?
"
said
Mr
Nupkins
,
pointing
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
,
as
the
spokesman
of
his
friends
,
stood
hat
in
hand
,
bowing
with
the
utmost
politeness
and
respect
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This

continued
Mr

thrusting
Grummer
aside
,
and
addressing
the
magistrate
with
pleasant
familiarity
,
"

"
   
<EOS>
At
the
conclusion
of
this
address
,
Mr
Weller
brushed
his
hat
with
his
right
elbow
,
and
nodded
benignly
to
Jinks
,
who
had
heard
him
throughout
with
unspeakable
awe

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
attempted

<EOS>

You

replied
the

He

He

Oh

Mr

This

Jinks

Dubbley

all

the

threatened

It

<EOS>
"
He
is
a
vagabond
,
Mr
Jinks
,
"
said
the
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
vagabond
on
his
own
statement
,
---
 
<EOS>
is
he
not
,
Mr
Jinks
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
commit
him
---
I
'll
commit
him
as
such
,
"
said
Mr
Nupkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
wery
impartial
country
for
justice

"
said
Sam
.
<EOS>
"
There
ai
n't
a
magistrate
goin'
as
do
n't
commit
himself
twice
as
he
commits
other
people
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
sally
another
special
laughed
,
and
then
tried
to
look
so
supernaturally
solemn
,
that
the
magistrate
detected
him
immediately
.
   
<EOS>
"
Grummer
,
"
said
Mr
Nupkins
,
reddening
with
passion
,
<EOS>
"
how
dare
you
select
such
an
inefficient
and
disreputable
person
for
a
special
constable
,
as
that
man
?
 
<EOS>
How
dare
you
do
it
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
,
your
Wash
-
up
,
"
stammered
Grummer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
sorry
!
"
said
the
furious
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
repent
of
this
neglect
of
duty
,
Mr
Grummer
;
you
shall
be
made
an
example
of
.
 
<EOS>
Take
that
fellow
's
staff
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
drunk
,
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
drunk
,
your
Worship

"
said
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
ARE
drunk
,
"
returned
the
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
say
you
are
not
drunk
,
Sir
,
when
I
say
you
are
?
 
<EOS>
Does
n't
he
smell
of
spirits
,
Grummer
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Horrid
,
your
Wash
-
up
,
"
replied
Grummer
,
who
had
a
vague
impression
that
there
was
a
smell
of
rum
somewhere
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
knew
he
did
,
"
said
Mr
Nupkins
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
saw
he
was
drunk
when
he
first
came
into
the
room
,
by
his
excited
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
observe
his
excited
eye
,
Mr
Jinks
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
touched
a
drop
of
spirits
this
morning
,
"
said
the
man
,
who
was
as
sober
a
fellow
as
need
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
tell
me
a
falsehood
?
"
said
Mr
Nupkins
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
he
drunk
at
this
moment
,
Mr
Jinks
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Jinks
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Jinks
,
"
said
the
magistrate
,
"
I
shall
commit
that
man
for
contempt
.
 
<EOS>
Make
out
his
committal
,
Mr
Jinks
.
"
   
<EOS>
And
committed
the
special
would
have
been
,
only
Jinks
,
who
was
the
magistrate
's
adviser
(
having
had
a
legal
education
of
three
years
in
a
country
attorney
's
office
)
,
whispered
the
magistrate
that
he
thought
it
would
n't
do
;
so
the
magistrate
made
a
speech
,
and
said
,
that
in
consideration
of
the
special
's
family
,
he
would
merely
reprimand
and
discharge
him
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
the
special
was
abused
,
vehemently
,
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
sent
about
his
business
;
and
Grummer
,
Dubbley
,
Muzzle
,
and
all
the
other
specials
,
murmured
their
admiration
of
the
magnanimity
of
Mr
Nupkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr
Jinks
,
"
said
the
magistrate
,
"
swear
Grummer
.
"
   
<EOS>
Grummer
was
sworn
directly
;
but
as
Grummer
wandered
,
and
Mr
Nupkins
's
dinner
was
nearly
ready
,
Mr
Nupkins
cut
the
matter
short
,
by
putting
leading
questions
to
Grummer
,
which
Grummer
answered
as
nearly
in
the
affirmative
as
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
examination
went
off
,
all
very
smooth
and
comfortable
,
and
two
assaults
were
proved
against
Mr
Weller
,
and
a
threat
against
Mr
Winkle
,
and
a
push
against
Mr
Snodgrass
.
 
<EOS>
When
all
this
was
done
to
the
magistrate
's
satisfaction
,
the
magistrate
and
Mr
Jinks
consulted
in
whispers
.
   
<EOS>
The
consultation
having
lasted
about
ten
minutes
,
Mr
Jinks
retired
to
his
end
of
the
table
;
and
the
magistrate
,
with
a
preparatory
cough
,
drew
himself
up
in
his
chair
,
and
was
proceeding
to
commence
his
address
,
when
Mr
Pickwick
interposed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
for
interrupting
you
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
but
before
you
proceed
to
express
,
and
act
upon
,
any
opinion
you
may
have
formed
on
the
statements
which
have
been
made
here
,
I
must
claim
my
right
to
be
heard
so
far
as
I
am
personally
concerned
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
magistrate
peremptorily
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
submit
to
you
,
Sir
---
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
sir
,
"
interposed
the
magistrate
,
"
or
I
shall
order
an
officer
to
remove
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
order
your
officers
to
do
whatever
you
please
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
and
I
have
no
doubt
,
from
the
specimen
I
have
had
of
the
subordination
preserved
amongst
them
,
that
whatever
you
order
,
they
will
execute
,
Sir
;
but
I
shall
take
the
liberty
,
Sir
,
of
claiming
my
right
to
be
heard
,
until
I
am
removed
by
force
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Pickvick
and
principle
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Weller
,
in
a
very
audible
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
be
quiet
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dumb
as
a
drum
vith
a
hole
in
it
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Nupkins
looked
at
Mr
Pickwick
with
a
gaze
of
intense
astonishment
,
at
his
displaying
such
unwonted
temerity
;
and
was
apparently
about
to
return
a
very
angry
reply
,
when
Mr
Jinks
pulled
him
by
the
sleeve
,
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
,
the
magistrate
returned
a
half
-
audible
answer
,
and
then
the
whispering
was
renewed
.
 
<EOS>
Jinks
was
evidently
remonstrating
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
magistrate
,
gulping
down
,
with
a
very
bad
grace
,
his
disinclination
to
hear
anything
more
,
turned
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
said
sharply
,
"
What
do
you
want
to
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
First
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
sending
a
look
through
his
spectacles
,
under
which
even
Nupkins
quailed
,
<EOS>
"
first
,
I
wish
to
know
what
I
and
my
friend
have
been
brought
here
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Must
I
tell
him
?
"
whispered
the
magistrate
to
Jinks
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
had
better
,
sir
,
"
whispered
Jinks
to
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
information
has
been
sworn
before
me
,
"
said
the
magistrate
,
"
that
it
is
apprehended
you
are
going
to
fight
a
duel
,
and
that
the
other
man
,
Tupman
,
is
your
aider
and
abettor
in
it
.
<EOS>
Therefore
---
eh
,
Mr
Jinks
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Therefore
,
I
call
upon
you
both
,
to
<EOS>
---
I
think
that
's
the
course
,
<EOS>
Mr
Jinks
?
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
To
---
to
---
what
,
Mr
Jinks
?
"
said
the
magistrate
pettishly
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
find
bail
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
I
call
upon
you
both
---
as
I
was
about
to
say
when
I
was
interrupted
by
my
clerk
---
to
find
bail
.
"
<EOS>
"
Good
bail
,
"
whispered
Mr
Jinks
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
require
good
bail
,
"
said
the
magistrate
.
   
<EOS>
"
Town's
-
people
,
"
whispered
Jinks
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
must
be
townspeople
,
"
said
the
magistrate
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fifty
pounds
each
,
"
whispered
Jinks
,
"
and
<EOS>
householders
,
of
course
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
require
two
sureties
of
fifty
pounds
each
,
"
said
the
magistrate
aloud
,
with
great
dignity
,
"
and
they
must
be
householders
,
of
course
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
bless
my
heart
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
,
together
with
Mr
Tupman
,
was
all
amazement
and
indignation
;
"
we
are
perfect
strangers
in
this
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
as
little
knowledge
of
any
householders
here
,
as
I
have
intention
of
fighting
a
duel
with
anybody
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
,
"
replied
the
magistrate
,
"
I
dare
say
---
do
n't
you
,
Mr
Jinks
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
anything
more
to
say
?
"
inquired
the
magistrate
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
had
a
great
deal
more
to
say
,
which
he
would
no
doubt
have
said
,
very
little
to
his
own
advantage
,
or
the
magistrate
's
satisfaction
,
if
he
had
not
,
the
moment
he
ceased
speaking
,
been
pulled
by
the
sleeve
by
Mr
Weller
,
with
whom
he
was
immediately
engaged
in
so
earnest
a
conversation
,
that
he
suffered
the
magistrate
's
inquiry
to
pass
wholly
unnoticed
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Nupkins
was
not
the
man
to
ask
a
question
of
the
kind
twice
over
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
with
another
preparatory
cough
,
he
proceeded
,
amidst
the
reverential
and
admiring
silence
of
the
constables
,
to
pronounce
his
decision
.
<EOS>
He
should
fine
Weller
two
pounds
for
the
first
assault
,
and
three
pounds
for
the
second
.
 
<EOS>
He
should
fine
Winkle
two
pounds
,
and
Snodgrass
one
pound
,
besides
requiring
them
to
enter
into
their
own
recognisances
to
keep
the
peace
towards
all
his
Majesty
's
subjects
,
and
especially
towards
his
liege
servant
,
Daniel
Grummer
.
 
<EOS>
Pickwick
and
Tupman
he
had
already
held
to
bail
.
   
<EOS>
Immediately
on
the
magistrate
ceasing
to
speak
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
a
smile
mantling
on
his
again
good
-
humoured
countenance
,
stepped
forward
,
and
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
the
magistrate
's
pardon
,
but
may
I
request
a
few
minutes
"
private
conversation
with
him
,
on
a
matter
of
deep
importance
to
himself
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
said
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
repeated
his
request
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
most
extraordinary
request
,
"
said
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
private
interview
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
private
interview
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
firmly
;
"
<EOS>
only
,
as
a
part
of
the
information
which
I
wish
to
communicate
is
derived
from
my
servant
,
I
should
wish
him
to
be
present
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
magistrate
looked
at
Mr
Jinks
;
Mr
Jinks
looked
at
the
magistrate
;
the
officers
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
Mr
Nupkins
turned
suddenly
pale
.
 
<EOS>
Could
the
man
Weller
,
in
a
moment
of
remorse
,
have
divulged
some
secret
conspiracy
for
his
assassination
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
dreadful
thought
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
public
man
;
and
he
turned
paler
,
as
he
thought
of
Julius
Caesar
and
Mr
Perceval
.
   
<EOS>
The
magistrate
looked
at
Mr
Pickwick
again
,
and
beckoned
Mr
Jinks
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
this
request
,
Mr
Jinks
?
<EOS>
"
murmured
Mr
Nupkins
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jinks
,
who
did
n't
exactly
know
what
to
think
of
it
,
and
was
afraid
he
might
offend
,
smiled
feebly
,
after
a
dubious
fashion
,
and
,
screwing
up
the
corners
of
his
mouth
,
shook
his
head
slowly
from
side
to
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Jinks
,
"
said
the
magistrate
gravely
,
"
you
are
an
ass
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
little
expression
of
opinion
,
Mr
Jinks
smiled
again
---
rather
more
feebly
than
before
---
and
edged
himself
,
by
degrees
,
back
into
his
own
corner
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Nupkins
debated
the
matter
within
himself
for
a
few
seconds
,
and
then
,
rising
from
his
chair
,
and
requesting
Mr
Pickwick
and
Sam
to
follow
him
,
led
the
way
into
a
small
room
which
opened
into
the
justice
-
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
Desiring
Mr
Pickwick
to
walk
to
the
upper
end
of
the
little
apartment
,
and
holding
his
hand
upon
the
half
-
closed
door
,
that
he
might
be
able
to
effect
an
immediate
escape
,
in
case
there
was
the
least
tendency
to
a
display
of
hostilities
<EOS>
,
Mr
Nupkins
expressed
his
readiness
to
hear
the
communication
,
whatever
it
might
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
come
to
the
point
at
once
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
it
affects
yourself
and
your
credit
materially
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
every
reason
to
believe
,
Sir
,
that
you
are
harbouring
in
your
house
a
gross
impostor

Two

interrupted
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mulberry

tears
and
willainny

<EOS>
"
Sam

said
Mr

,
"
if
I
am
to

myself
intelligible

I
must
beg
you
to
control
your

"
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
sorry

replied
Mr
Weller
;
"
but

when
I

<EOS>
"
In
one
word

said
Mr
Pickwick

"
is

right

suspecting

a

Fitz

Marshall

habit

<EOS>
Because

"
added
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
he
saw
that
Mr
Nupkins
was
about
to
offer
a
very
indignant
interruption

closing

An

Sir
<EOS>
,
"
said
the
excited
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
"
said
Mr
Nupkins
,
turning
very
red
,
and
altering
his
whole
manner
directly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
Mr
---
"
   
"
Pickvick
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pickwick
,
"
said
the
magistrate
,
"
dear
me
,
Mr
Pickwick
---
pray
take
a
seat
<EOS>
---
you
can
not
mean
this
?
 
<EOS>
Captain
Fitz
-
Marshall
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
call
him
a
cap'en
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
nor
<EOS>
Fitz
-
Marshall
neither
;
he
ai
n't
neither
one
nor
t'other
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
strolling
actor
,
he
is
,
and
his
name
's
Jingle
;
<EOS>
and
if
ever
there
was
a
wolf
in
a
mulberry
suit
,
that
'
ere
<EOS>
Job
Trotter
's
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
true
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
replying
to
the
magistrate
's
look
of
amazement
;
"
my
only
business
in
this
town
,
is
to
expose
the
person
of
whom
we
now
speak
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
proceeded
to
pour
into
the
horror
-
stricken
ear
of
Mr
Nupkins
,
an
abridged
account
of
all
Mr
Jingle
's
atrocities
.
<EOS>
He
related
how
he
had
first
met
him
;
how
he
had
eloped
with
Miss
Wardle
;
how
he
had
cheerfully
resigned
the
lady
for
a
pecuniary
consideration
;
how
he
had
entrapped
himself
into
a
lady
's
boarding
-
school
at
midnight
;
and
how
he
(
Mr
Pickwick
)
now
felt
it
his
duty
to
expose
his
assumption
of
his
present
name
and
rank
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
narrative
proceeded
,
all
the
warm
blood
in
the
body
of
Mr
Nupkins
tingled
up
into
the
very
tips
of
his
ears
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
picked
up
the
captain
at
a
neighbouring
race
-
course
.
 
<EOS>
Charmed
with
his
long
list
of
aristocratic
acquaintance
,
<EOS>
his
extensive
travel
,
and
his
fashionable
demeanour
,
Mrs
Nupkins
and
Miss
Nupkins
had
exhibited
Captain
Fitz
-
Marshall
,
and
quoted
Captain
Fitz
-
Marshall
,
and
hurled
Captain
Fitz
-
Marshall
at
the
devoted
heads
of
their
select
circle
of
acquaintance
,
until
their
bosom
friends
,
Mrs
Porkenham
and
the
Misses
Porkenhams
,
and
Mr
Sidney
Porkenham
,
were
ready
to
burst
with
jealousy
and
despair
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
to
hear
,
after
all
,
that
he
was
a
needy
adventurer
,
a
strolling
player
,
and
if
not
a
swindler
,
something
so
very
like
it
,
that
it
was
hard
to
tell
the
difference
!
 
<EOS>
Heavens
!
<EOS>
what
would
the
Porkenhams
say
!
 
<EOS>
What
would
be
the
triumph
of
Mr
Sidney
Porkenham
when
he
found
that
his
addresses
had
been
slighted
for
such
a
rival
!
 
<EOS>
How
should
he
,
Nupkins
,
meet
the
eye
of
old
Porkenham
at
the
next
quarter
-
sessions
!
 
<EOS>
And
what
a
handle
would
it
be
for
the
opposition
magisterial
party
if
the
story
got
abroad
!
   
<EOS>
"
But
after
all
,
"
said
Mr
Nupkins
,
brightening
for
a
moment
,
after
a
long
pause
;
"
after
all
,
this
is
a
mere
statement
.
 
<EOS>
Captain
Fitz
-
Marshall
is
a
man
of
very
engaging
manners
,
and
,
I
dare
say
,
has
many
enemies
.
 
<EOS>
What
proof
have
you
of
the
truth
of
these
representations
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Confront
me
with
him
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
that
is
all
I
ask
,
and
all
I
require
.
 
<EOS>
Confront
him
with
me
and
my
friends
here
;
you
will
want
no
further
proof
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
said
Mr
Nupkins
,
"
that
might
be
very
easily
done
,
for
he
will
be
here
to
-
night
,
and
then
there
would
be
no
occasion
to
make
the
matter
public
,
just
---
<EOS>
just
---
for
the
young
man
's
own
sake
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
---
<EOS>
I
---
should
like
to
consult
Mrs
Nupkins
on
the
propriety
of
the
step
,
in
the
first
instance
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
we
must
despatch
this
legal
business
before
we
can
do
anything
else
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
step
back
into
the
next
room
.
"
   
<EOS>
Into
the
next
room
they
went
.
   
<EOS>
"
Grummer
,
"
said
the
magistrate
,
in
an
awful
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
Wash
-
up
,
"
replied
Grummer
,
with
the
smile
of
a
favourite
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
magistrate
sternly
,
"
do
n't
let
me
see
any
of
this
levity
here
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
unbecoming
,
and
I
can
assure
you
that
you
have
very
little
to
smile
at
.
 
<EOS>
Was
the
account
you
gave
me
just
now
strictly
true
?
 
<EOS>
Now
be
careful
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
"
Your
Wash
-
up
,
"
stammered
Grummer
,
"
I-
"
   
"
Oh
,
you
are
confused
,
are
you
?
"
said
the
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Jinks
,
you
observe
this
confusion
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Jinks
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
the
magistrate
,
"
repeat
your
statement
,
Grummer
,
and
<EOS>
again
I
warn
you
to
be
careful
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jinks
,
take
his
words
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
Grummer
proceeded
to
re
-
state
his
complaint
,
but
<EOS>
,
what
between
Mr
Jinks
's
taking
down
his
words
,
and
the
magistrate
's
taking
them
up
,
his
natural
tendency
to
rambling
,
and
his
extreme
confusion
,
he
managed
to
get
involved
,
in
something
under
three
minutes
,
in
such
a
mass
of
entanglement
and
contradiction
,
that
Mr
Nupkins
at
once
declared
he
did
n't
believe
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
fines
were
remitted
,
and
Mr
Jinks
found
a
couple
of
bail
in
no
time
.
 
<EOS>
And
all
these
solemn
proceedings
having
been
satisfactorily
concluded
,
Mr
Grummer
was
ignominiously
ordered
out
---
an
awful
instance
of
the
instability
of
human
greatness
,
and
the
uncertain
tenure
of
great
men
's
favour
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Nupkins
was
a
majestic
female
in
a
pink
gauze
turban
and
a
light
brown
wig
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Nupkins
possessed
all
her
mamma
's
haughtiness
without
the
turban
,
and
all
her
ill
-
nature
without
the
wig
;
and
whenever
the
exercise
of
these
two
amiable
qualities
involved
mother
and
daughter
in
some
unpleasant
dilemma
,
as
they
not
infrequently
did
,
they
both
concurred
in
laying
the
blame
on
the
shoulders
of
Mr
Nupkins
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
when
Mr
Nupkins
sought
Mrs
Nupkins
,
and
detailed
the
communication
which
had
been
made
by
Mr
Pickwick
,
Mrs
Nupkins
suddenly
recollected
that
she
had
always
expected
something
of
the
kind
;
that
she
had
always
said
it
would
be
so
;
that
her
advice
was
never
taken
;
that
she
really
did
not
know
what
Mr
Nupkins
supposed
she
was
;
and
so
forth
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
idea
!
<EOS>
"
said
Miss
Nupkins
,
forcing
a
tear
of
very
scanty
proportions
into
the
corner
of
each
eye
;
"
the
idea
of
my
being
made
such
a
fool
of
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
may
thank
your
papa
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Nupkins
;
"
how
I
have
implored
and
begged
that
man
to
inquire
into
the
captain
's
family
connections
;
how
I
have
urged
and
entreated
him
to
take
some
decisive
step
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
certain
nobody
would
believe
it
---
quite
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Nupkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
to
me
,
<EOS>
you
aggravating
thing
,
do
n't
!
"
said
Mrs
Nupkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
love
,
"
said
Mr
Nupkins
,
"
you
professed
yourself
very
fond
of
Captain
Fitz
-
Marshall
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
constantly
asked
him
here
,
my
dear
,
and
you
have
lost
no
opportunity
of
introducing
him
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
I
say
so
,
Henrietta
?
"
cried
Mrs
Nupkins
,
appealing
to
her
daughter
with
the
air
of
a
much
-
injured
female
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
I
say
that
your
papa
would
turn
round
and
lay
all
this
at
my
door
?
<EOS>
Did
n't
I
say
so
?
"
 
<EOS>
Here
Mrs
Nupkins
sobbed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
pa
!
"
remonstrated
Miss
Nupkins
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
she
sobbed
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
it
too
much
,
when
he
has
brought
all
this
disgrace
and
ridicule
upon
us
,
to
taunt
me
with
being
the
cause
of
it
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mrs
Nupkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
we
ever
show
ourselves
in
society
!
"
said
Miss
Nupkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
we
face
the
Porkenhams
?
"
cried
Mrs
Nupkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Or
the
Griggs
!
"
cried
Miss
Nupkins
.
<EOS>
"
Or
the
Slummintowkens
!
"
cried
Mrs
Nupkins
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
what
does
your
papa
care
!
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
to
HIM
!
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
dreadful
reflection
,
Mrs
Nupkins
wept
mental
anguish
,
and
Miss
Nupkins
followed
on
the
same
side
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Nupkins
's
tears
continued
to
gush
forth
,
with
great
velocity
,
until
she
had
gained
a
little
time
to
think
the
matter
over
;
when
she
decided
,
in
her
own
mind
,
that
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
ask
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
friends
to
remain
until
the
captain
's
arrival
,
and
then
to
give
Mr
Pickwick
the
opportunity
he
sought
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
appeared
that
he
had
spoken
truly
,
the
captain
could
be
turned
out
of
the
house
without
noising
the
matter
abroad
,
and
they
could
easily
account
to
the
Porkenhams
for
his
disappearance
,
by
saying
that
he
had
been
appointed
,
through
the
Court
influence
of
his
family
,
to
the
governor
-
generalship
of
Sierra
Leone
,
of
Saugur
Point
,
or
any
other
of
those
salubrious
climates
which
enchant
Europeans
so
much
,
that
when
they
once
get
there
,
they
can
hardly
ever
prevail
upon
themselves
to
come
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
When
Mrs
Nupkins
dried
up
her
tears
,
Miss
Nupkins
dried
up
hers
,
and
Mr
Nupkins
was
very
glad
to
settle
the
matter
as
Mrs
Nupkins
had
proposed
.
 
<EOS>
So
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
friends
,
having
washed
off
all
marks
of
their
late
encounter
,
were
introduced
to
the
ladies
,
and
soon
afterwards
to
their
dinner
;
and
Mr
Weller
,
whom
the
magistrate
,
with
his
peculiar
sagacity
,
had
discovered
in
half
an
hour
to
be
one
of
the
finest
fellows
alive
,
was
consigned
to
the
care
and
guardianship
of
Mr
Muzzle
,
who
was
specially
enjoined
to
take
him
below
,
and
make
much
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
de
do
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Muzzle
,
as
he
conducted
Mr
Weller
down
the
kitchen
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
no
considerable
change
has
taken
place
in
the
state
of
my
system
,
since
I
see
you
cocked
up
behind
your
governor
's
chair
in
the
parlour
,
a
little
vile
ago
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
excuse
my
not
taking
more
notice
of
you
then
,
"
said
Mr
Muzzle
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
master
had
n't
introduced
us
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
,
how
fond
he
is
of
you
,
Mr
Weller
,
to
be
sure
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Sam
,
"
what
a
pleasant
chap
<EOS>
he
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ai
n't
he
?
"
replied
Mr
Muzzle
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
much
humour
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
such
a
man
to
speak
,
"
said
Mr
Muzzle
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
his
ideas
flow
,
do
n't
they
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wonderful
,
"
replied
Sam
;
"
they
comes
a
-
pouring
out
,
knocking
each
other
's
heads
so
fast
,
that
they
seems
to
stun
one
another
;
you
hardly
know
what
he
's
arter
,
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
great
merit
of
his
style
of
speaking
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Muzzle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
care
of
the
last
step
,
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
like
to
wash
your
hands
,
sir
,
before
we
join
the
ladies
!
 
<EOS>
Here
's
a
sink
,
with
the
water
laid
on
,
Sir
,
and
a
clean
jack
towel
behind
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
perhaps
I
may
as
well
have
a
rinse
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
,
applying
plenty
of
yellow
soap
to
the
towel
,
and
rubbing
away
till
his
face
shone
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
many
ladies
are
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
two
in
our
kitchen
,
"
said
Mr
Muzzle
;
"
cook
and
'
ouse
-
maid
.
<EOS>
We
keep
a
boy
to
do
the
dirty
work
,
and
a
gal
besides
,
but
they
dine
in
the
wash'us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
they
dines
in
the
wash'us
,
do
they
?
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Mr
Muzzle
,
"
we
tried
'em
at
our
table
when
they
first
come
,
but
we
could
n't
keep
'em
.
 
<EOS>
The
gal
's
manners
is
dreadful
vulgar
;
and
the
boy
breathes
so
very
hard
while
he
's
eating
,
that
we
found
it
impossible
to
sit
at
table
with
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Young
grampus
!
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dreadful
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Muzzle
;
"
but
that
is
the
worst
of
country
service
,
Mr
Weller
;
the
juniors
is
always
so
very
savage
.
<EOS>
This
way
,
sir
,
if
you
please
,
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Preceding
Mr
Weller
,
with
the
utmost
politeness
,
Mr
Muzzle
conducted
him
into
the
kitchen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
"
said
Mr
Muzzle
to
the
pretty

comfortable
as

<EOS>
"
And

a

hand
,
and
has
just
sent

to
the
right

"
said
Mr
Weller
,
with
a
glance
of
admiration
at
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
wos
master
o
'
<EOS>
this
here
house
<EOS>
,
I
should
alvays
find
the
materials
for

"
<EOS>
"
Lor
,
Mr
Weller
!
"
said
Mary
blushing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
never
!
"
ejaculated
the
cook
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
me
,
cook
<EOS>
,
I
forgot
you
,
"
said
Mr
Muzzle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Weller
,
let
me
introduce
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
,
ma'am
?
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
<EOS>
"
Wery
glad
to
see
you
,
indeed
,
and
hope
our
acquaintance
may
be
a
long
'
un
,
as
the
gen'l'm'n
said
to
the

note

"
   
When
this
ceremony
of
introduction
had
been
gone
through
,
the
cook
and
Mary
retired
into
the
back
kitchen
to
titter
,
for
ten
minutes
;
then
returning
,
all
giggles
and
blushes
,
they
sat
down
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
's
easy
manners
and
conversational
powers
had
such
irresistible
influence
with
his
new
friends
,
that
before
the
dinner
was
half
over
,
they
were
on
a
footing
of
perfect
intimacy
,
and
in
possession
of
a
full
account
of
the
delinquency
of
Job
Trotter
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
could
a
-
bear
that
Job
,
"
said
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
more
you
never
ought
to
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
inquired
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
"
'Cos
ugliness
and
svindlin
'
never
ought
to
be
formiliar
with
elegance
and
wirtew
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ought
they
,
Mr
Muzzle
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
by
no
means
,
"
replied
that
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
Here
Mary
laughed
,
and
said
the
cook
had
made
her
;
and
the
cook
laughed
,
and
said
she
had
n't
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ha'n't
got
a
glass
,
"
said
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
"
Drink
with
me
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
Put
your
lips
to
this
here
tumbler
,
and
then
I
can
kiss
you
by
deputy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
shame
,
Mr
Weller
!
"
said
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
a
shame
,
my
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Talkin
'
in
that
way
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
;
it
ai
n't
no
harm
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
natur
;
ai
n't
it
,
cook
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
ask
me
,
imperence
,
"
replied
the
cook
,
in
a
high
state
of
delight
;
and
hereupon
the
cook
and
Mary
laughed
again
,
till
what
between
the
beer
,
and
the
cold
meat
,
and
the
laughter
combined
,
the
latter
young
lady
was
brought
to
the
verge
of
choking
---
an
alarming
crisis
from
which
she
was
only
recovered
by
sundry
pats
on
the
back
,
and
other
necessary
attentions
,
most
delicately
administered
by
Mr
Samuel
Weller
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
all
this
jollity
and
conviviality
,
a
loud
ring
was
heard
at
the
garden
gate
,
to
which
the
young
gentleman
who
took
his
meals
in
the
wash
-
house
,
immediately
responded
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
was
in
the
height
of
his
attentions
to
the
pretty
house
-
maid
;
Mr
Muzzle
was
busy
doing
the
honours
of
the
table
;
and
the
cook
had
just
paused
to
laugh
,
in
the
very
act
of
raising
a
huge
morsel
to
her
lips
;
when
the
kitchen
door
opened
,
and
in
walked
Mr
Job
Trotter
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
said
in
walked
Mr
Job
Trotter
,
but
the
statement
is
not
distinguished
by
our
usual
scrupulous
adherence
to
fact
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
opened
and
Mr
Trotter
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
walked
in
,
and
was
in
the
very
act
of
doing
so
,
indeed
,
when
catching
sight
of
Mr
Weller
,
he
involuntarily
shrank
back
a
pace
or
two
,
and
stood
gazing
on
the
unexpected
scene
before
him
,
perfectly
motionless
with
amazement
and
terror
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
he
is
!
"
said
Sam
,
rising
with
great
glee
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
we
were
that
wery
moment
a
-
speaking
o
'
you
.
 
<EOS>
How
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
Where
have
you
been
?
 
<EOS>
Come
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
Laying
his
hand
on
the
mulberry
collar
of
the
unresisting
Job
,
Mr
Weller
dragged
him
into
the
kitchen
;
and
,
locking
the
door
,
handed
the
key
to
Mr
Muzzle
,
who
very
coolly
buttoned
it
up
in
a
side
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
here
's
a
game
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
think
o
'
<EOS>
my
master
havin'
<EOS>
the
pleasure
o
'
meeting
yourn
upstairs
,
and
<EOS>
me
havin'
the
joy
<EOS>
o

meetin

you
down

<EOS>
How
are
you
gettin

on
,
and
how
is
the
chandlery
bis'ness
likely
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
am
so
glad
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
How
happy
you
look
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
quite
a
treat
to
see
you
;
ai
n't
it
,
Mr
Muzzle
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
,
"
said
Mr
Muzzle
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
cheerful
he
is
!
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
such
good
spirits
!
"
said
Muzzle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
glad
to
see
us
<EOS>
---
that
makes
it
so
much
more
comfortable
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
;
sit
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Trotter
suffered
himself
to
be
forced
into
a
chair
by
the
fireside
.
 
<EOS>
He
cast
his
small
eyes
,
first
on
Mr
Weller
,
and
then
on
Mr
Muzzle
,
but
said
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
now
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
afore
these
here
ladies
<EOS>
,
I
should
jest
like
to
ask
you
,
as
a
sort
of
curiosity
,
whether
you
do
n't
consider
yourself
as
nice
and
well
-
behaved
a
young
gen'l'm'n
,
as
ever
used
a
pink
check
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
and
the
number
four
collection
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
as
was
ever
a
-
going
to
be
married
to
a
cook
,
"
said
that
lady
indignantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
willin
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
leave
off
his
evil
ways
,
and
set
up
in
the
chandlery
line
arterwards
,
"
said
the
housemaid
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
,
young
man
,
"
said
Mr
Muzzle
solemnly
,
enraged
at
the
last
two
allusions
,
"
this
here
lady
(
pointing
to
the
cook
)
keeps
company
with
me
;
and
when
you
presume
,
Sir
,
to
talk
of
keeping
chandlers
"
shops
with
her
,
you
injure
me
in
one
of
the
most
delicatest
points
in
which
one
man
can
injure
another
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
that
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Muzzle
,
who
had
a
great
notion
of
his
eloquence
,
in
which
he
imitated
his
master
,
paused
for
a
reply
.
   
<EOS>
But
Mr
Trotter
made
no
reply
.
 
<EOS>
So
Mr
Muzzle
proceeded
in
a
solemn
manner
---
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
probable
,
sir
,
that
you
wo
n't
be
wanted
upstairs
for
several
minutes
,
Sir
,
because
MY
master
is
at
this
moment
particularly
engaged
in
settling
the
hash
of
YOUR
master
,
Sir
;
and
therefore
you
'll
have
leisure
,
Sir
,
for
a
little
private
talk
with
me
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
that
,
Sir
?
"
   
Mr
Muzzle
again
paused
for
a
reply
;
and
again
Mr
Trotter
disappointed
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
said
Mr
Muzzle
,
"
I
'm
very
sorry
to
have
to
explain
myself
before
ladies
,
but
the
urgency
of
the
case
will
be
my
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
The
back
kitchen
's
empty
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
will
step
in
there
,
Sir
,
Mr
Weller
will
see
fair
,
and
we
can
have
mutual
satisfaction
till
the
bell
rings
.
 
<EOS>
Follow
me
,
Sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Muzzle
uttered
these
words
,
he
took
a
step
or
two
towards
the
door
;
and
,
by
way
of
saving
time
,
began
to
pull
off
his
coat
as
he
walked
along
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
the
cook
no
sooner
heard
the
concluding
words
of
this
desperate
challenge
,
and
saw
Mr
Muzzle
about
to
put
it
into
execution
,
than
she
uttered
a
loud
and
piercing
shriek
;
and
rushing
on
Mr
Job
Trotter
,
who
rose
from
his
chair
on
the
instant
,
tore
and
buffeted
his
large
flat
face
,
with
an
energy
peculiar
to
excited
females
,
and
twining
her
hands
in
his
long
black
hair
,
tore
therefrom
about
enough
to
make
five
or
six
dozen
of
the
very
largest
-
sized
mourning
-
rings
.
 
<EOS>
Having
accomplished
this
feat
with
all
the
ardour
which
her
devoted
love
for
Mr
Muzzle
inspired
,
she
staggered
back
;
and
being
a
lady
of
very
excitable
and
delicate
feelings
,
she
instantly
fell
under
the
dresser
,
and
fainted
away
.
   
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
the
bell
rang
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
for
you
,
Job
Trotter
,
"
said
Sam
;
and
before
Mr
Trotter
could
offer
remonstrance
or
reply
---
even
before
he
had
time
to
stanch
the
wounds
inflicted
by
the
insensible
lady
<EOS>
---
Sam
seized
one
arm
and
Mr
Muzzle
the
other
,
and
one
pulling
before
,
and
the
other
pushing
behind
,
they
conveyed
him
upstairs
,
and
into
the
parlour
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
an
impressive
tableau
.
 
<EOS>
Alfred
Jingle
,
Esquire
,
alias
Captain
Fitz
-
Marshall
,
was
standing
near
the
door
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
and
a
smile
on
his
face
,
wholly
unmoved
by
his
very
unpleasant
situation
.
 
<EOS>
Confronting
him
,
stood
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
had
evidently
been
inculcating
some
high
moral
lesson
;
for
his
left
hand
was
beneath
his
coat
tail
,
and
his
right
extended
in
air
,
as
was
his
wo
nt
when
delivering
himself
of
an
impressive
address
.
<EOS>
At
a
little
distance
,
stood
Mr
Tupman
with
indignant
countenance
,
carefully
held
back
by
his
two
younger
friends
;
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
were
Mr
Nupkins
,
Mrs
Nupkins
,
and
Miss
Nupkins
,
gloomily
grand
and
savagely
vexed
.
<EOS>
"
What
prevents
me
,
"
said
Mr
Nupkins
,
with
magisterial
dignity
,
as
Job
was
brought
in
---
"
what
prevents
me
from
detaining
these
men
as
rogues
and
impostors
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
foolish
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
What
prevents
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pride
,
old
fellow
,
pride
,
"
replied
Jingle
,
quite
at
his
ease
.
"
Would
n't
do
---
<EOS>
no
go
---
<EOS>
caught
a
captain
,
eh
?
---
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha

<EOS>

public
---

---

---
very

"
   
<EOS>
"
Wretch
,
"
said
Mr
Nupkins
,
"
we
scorn
your
base
insinuations
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
always
hated
him
,
"
added
Henrietta
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
of
course
,
"
said
Jingle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tall
young
man
---
old
lover
---
Sidney
Porkenham
---
rich
---
fine
fellow
---
not
so
rich
as
captain

eh

turn
him
away

off

anything

nothing

all

eh

Job
,
eh

"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Jingle
laughed
very
heartily
;
and
Job
,
rubbing
his
hands
with
delight
,
uttered
the
first
sound
he
had
given
vent
to
since
he
entered
the
house
---
a
low
,
noiseless
chuckle
,
which
seemed
to
intimate
that
he
enjoyed
his
laugh
too
much
,
to
let
any
of
it
escape
in
sound
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Nupkins
,
"
said
the
elder
lady
,
"
this
is
not
a
fit
conversation
for
the
servants
to
overhear
.
 
<EOS>
Let
these
wretches
be
removed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
my
dear
,
"
Said
Mr
,
Nupkins
.
 
<EOS>
"
Muzzle
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
Worship
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Open
the
front
door
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
your
Worship
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Leave
the
house
!
"
said
Mr
Nupkins
,
waving
his
hand
emphatically
.
   
<EOS>
Jingle
smiled
,
and
moved
towards
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
Jingle
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
might
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
have
taken
a
much
greater
revenge
for
the
treatment
I
have
experienced
at
your
hands
,
and
that
of
your
hypocritical
friend
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
Job
Trotter
bowed
with
great
politeness
,
and
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
growing
gradually
angry
,
"
that
I
might
have
taken
a
greater
revenge
,
but
I
content
myself
with
exposing
you
,
which
I
consider
a
duty
I
owe
to
society
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
leniency
,
Sir
,
which
I
hope
you
will
remember
.
"
   
<EOS>
When
Mr
Pickwick
arrived
at
this
point
,
Job
Trotter
,
with
facetious
gravity
,
applied
his
hand
to
his
ear
,
as
if
desirous
not
to
lose
a
syllable
he
uttered
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
have
only
to
add
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
now
thoroughly
angry
,
"
that
I
consider
you
a
rascal
,
and
a
---
a

ruffian

and

and
worse
than
any
man
I
ever
saw

mulberry

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha

said
Jingle

"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
Mr
Jingle
stuck
on
his
hat
in
his
old
fashion
,
and
strode
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Job
Trotter
paused
,
looked
round
,
smiled
and
then
with
a
bow
of
mock
solemnity
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
a
wink
to
Mr
Weller
,
the
audacious
slyness
of
which
baffles
all
description
,
followed
the
footsteps
of
his
hopeful
master
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
Mr
Weller
was
following
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
.
"
<EOS>
"
Stay
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
seemed
uncertain
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
here
,
"
repeated
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
n't
I
polish
that
'
ere
Job
off
,
in
the
front
garden
?
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
"
<EOS>
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
n't
I
kick
him
out
o
'
<EOS>
the
gate
,
Sir
?
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
on
any
account
,
"
replied
his
master
.
   
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
since
his
engagement
,
Mr
Weller
looked
,
for
a
moment
,
discontented
and
unhappy
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
countenance
immediately
cleared
up
;
for
the
wily
Mr
Muzzle
,
by
concealing
himself
behind
the
street
door
,
and
rushing
violently
out
,
at
the
right
instant
,
contrived
with
great
dexterity
to
overturn
both
Mr
Jingle
and
his
attendant
,
down
the
flight
of
steps
,
into
the
American
aloe
tubs
that
stood
beneath
.
   
<EOS>
"
Having
discharged
my
duty
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
to
Mr
Nupkins
,
"
I
will
,
with
my
friends
,
bid
you
farewell
.
 
<EOS>
While
we
thank
you
for
such
hospitality
as
we
have
received
,
permit
me
to
assure
you
,
in
our
joint
names
,
that
we
should
not
have
accepted
it
,
or
have
consented
to
extricate
ourselves
in
this
way
,
from
our
previous
dilemma
,
had
we
not
been
impelled
by
a
strong
sense
of
duty
.
 
<EOS>
We
return
to
London
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Your
secret
is
safe
with
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
Having
thus
entered
his
protest
against
their
treatment
of
the
morning
,
Mr
Pickwick
bowed
low
to
the
ladies
,
and
notwithstanding
the
solicitations
of
the
family
,
left
the
room
with
his
friends
.
   
<EOS>
"
Get
your
hat
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
below
stairs
,
Sir
,
"
said
Sam
,
and
he
ran
down
after
it
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
there
was
nobody
in
the
kitchen
,
but
the
pretty
housemaid
;
and
as
Sam
's
hat
was
mislaid
,
he
had
to
look
for
it
,
and
the
pretty
housemaid
lighted
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
to
look
all
over
the
place
for
the
hat
.
 
<EOS>
The
pretty
housemaid
,
in
her
anxiety
to
find
it
,
went
down
on
her
knees
,
and
turned
over
all
the
things
that
were
heaped
together
in
a
little
corner
by
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
awkward
corner
.
 
<EOS>
You
could
n't
get
at
it
without
shutting
the
door
first
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
it
is
,
"
said
the
pretty
housemaid
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
it
,
ai
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
look
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
The
pretty
housemaid
had
stood
the
candle
on
the
floor
;
and
,
as
it
gave
a
very
dim
light
,
Sam
was
obliged
to
go
down
on
HIS
knees
before
he
could
see
whether
it
really
was
his
own
hat
or
not
.
<EOS>
it
was
a
remarkably
small
corner
,
and
<EOS>
so
---
it
was
nobody
's
fault
but
the
man
's
who
built
the
house
---
Sam
and
the
pretty
housemaid
were
necessarily
very
close
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
this
is
it
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
pretty
housemaid
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
!
<EOS>
"
said
Sam
;
and
as
he
said
it
,
he
dropped
the
hat
that
had
cost
so
much
trouble
in
looking
for
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
awkward
you
are
,
"
said
the
pretty
housemaid
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
lose
it
again
,
if
you
do
n't
take
care
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
just
to
prevent
his
losing
it
again
,
she
put
it
on
for
him
.
   
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
that
the
pretty
housemaid
's
face
looked
prettier
still
,
when
it
was
raised
towards
Sam
's
,
or
whether
it
was
the
accidental
consequence
of
their
being
so
near
to
each
other
,
is
matter
of
uncertainty
to
this
day
;
but
Sam
kissed
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
did
that
on
purpose
,
"
said
the
pretty
housemaid
,
blushing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
did
n't
then
,
"
said
Sam
;
"
but
<EOS>
I
will
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
he
kissed
her
again
.
<EOS>
"
Sam
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
calling
over
the
banisters
.
   
<EOS>
"
Coming
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Sam
,
running
upstairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
long
you
have
been
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
was
something
behind
the
door
,
Sir
,
which
perwented
our
getting
it
open
,
for
ever
so
long
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
And
this
was
the
first
passage
of
Mr
Weller
's
first
love
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
26
.
<EOS>
Which
contains
a
brief
account
of
the
progress
of
the
action
of
Bardell
against
Pickwick
 
Having
accomplished
the
main
end
and
object
of
his
journey
,
by
the
exposure
of
Jingle
,
Mr
Pickwick
resolved
on
immediately
returning
to
London
,
with
the
view
of
becoming
acquainted
with
the
proceedings
which
had
been
taken
against
him
,
in
the
meantime
,
by
Messrs.
Dodson
and
Fogg
.
 
<EOS>
Acting
upon
this
resolution
with
all
the
energy
and
decision
of
his
character
,
he
mounted
to
the
back
seat
of
the
first
coach
which
left
Ipswich
on
the
morning
after
the
memorable
occurrences
detailed
at
length
in
the
two
preceding
chapters
;
and
accompanied
by
his
three
friends
,
and
Mr
Samuel
Weller
,
arrived
in
the
metropolis
,
in
perfect
health
and
safety
,
the
same
evening
.
   
<EOS>
Here
the
friends
,
for
a
short
time
,
separated
.
 
<EOS>
Messrs.
Tupman
,
Winkle
,
and
Snodgrass
repaired
to
their
several
homes
to
make
such
preparations
as
might
be
requisite
for
their
forthcoming
visit
to
Dingley
Dell
;
and
Mr
Pickwick
and
Sam
took
up
their
present
abode
in
very
good
,
old
-
fashioned
,
and
comfortable
quarters
,
to
wit
,
the
George
and
Vulture
Tavern
and
Hotel
,
George
Yard
,
Lombard
Street
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
had
dined
,
finished
his
second
pint
of
particular
port
,
pulled
his
silk
handkerchief
over
his
head
,
put
his
feet
on
the
fender
,
and
thrown
himself
back
in
an
easy
-
chair
,
when
the
entrance
of
Mr
Weller
with
his
carpet
-
bag
,
aroused
him
from
his
tranquil
meditation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
been
thinking
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
that
having
left
a
good
many
things
at
Mrs
Bardell
's
,
in
Goswell
Street
,
I
ought
to
arrange
for
taking
them
away
,
before
I
leave
town
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Wery
good
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
send
them
to
Mr
Tupman
's
,
for
the
present
,
Sam
,
"
continued
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
but
before
we
take
them
away
,
it
is
necessary
that
they
should
be
looked
up
,
and
put
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
step
up
to
Goswell
Street
,
Sam
,
and
arrange
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
once
,
Sir
?
"
inquired
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
once
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
stay
,
Sam
,
"
added
Mr
Pickwick
,
pulling
out
his
purse
,
"
there
is
some
rent
to
pay
.
 
<EOS>
The
quarter
is
not
due
till
Christmas
,
but
you
may
pay
it
,
and
have
done
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
month
's
notice
terminates
my
tenancy
.
 
<EOS>
Here
it
is
,
written
out
.
 
<EOS>
Give
it
,
and
tell
Mrs
Bardell
she
may
put
a
bill
up
,
as
soon
as
she
likes
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Wery
good
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
;
"
anythin
'
more
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
more
,
Sam
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
stepped
slowly
to
the
door
,
as
if
he
expected
something
more
;
slowly
opened
it
,
slowly
stepped
out
,
and
had
slowly
closed
it
within
a
couple
of
inches
,
when
Mr
Pickwick
called
out
---
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
stepping
quickly
back
,
and
closing
the
door
behind
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
objection
,
Sam
,
to
your
endeavouring
to
ascertain
how
Mrs
Bardell
herself
seems
disposed
towards
me
,
and
whether
it
is
really
probable
that
this
vile
and
groundless
action
is
to
be
carried
to
extremity
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
I
do
not
object
to
you
doing
this
,
if
you
wish
it
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
gave
a
short
nod
of
intelligence
,
and
left
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
drew
the
silk
handkerchief
once
more
over
his
head
,
And
composed
himself
for
a
nap
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
promptly
walked
forth
,
to
execute
his
commission
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
nearly
nine
o'clock
when
he
reached
Goswell
Street
.
 
<EOS>
A
couple
of
candles
were
burning
in
the
little
front
parlour
,
and
a
couple
of
caps
were
reflected
on
the
window
-
blind
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Bardell
had
got
company
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
knocked
at
the
door
,
and
after
a
pretty
long
interval
---
occupied
by
the
party
without
,
in
whistling
a
tune
,
and
by
the
party
within
,
in
persuading
a
refractory
flat
candle
to
allow
itself
to
be
lighted
---
a
pair
of
small
boots
pattered
over
the
floor
-
cloth
,
and
Master
Bardell
presented
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
young
townskip
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
how
's
mother
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
pretty
well
,
"
replied
Master
Bardell
,
"
so
am
I.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
that
's
a
mercy
,
"
said
Sam
;
"
tell
her
I
want
to
speak
to
her
,
<EOS>
will
you
,
my
hinfant
fernomenon
?
"
   
<EOS>
Master
Bardell
,
thus
adjured
,
placed
the
refractory
flat
candle
on
the
bottom
stair
,
and
vanished
into
the
front
parlour
with
his
message
.
   
<EOS>
The
two
caps
,
reflected
on
the
window
-
blind
,
were
the
respective
head
-
dresses
of
a
couple
of
Mrs
Bardell
's
most
particular
acquaintance
,
who
had
just
stepped
in
,
to
have
a
quiet
cup
of
tea
,
and
a
little
warm
supper
of
a
couple
of
sets
of
pettitoes
and
some
toasted
cheese
.
 
<EOS>
The
cheese
was
simmering
and
browning
away
,
most
delightfully
,
in
a
little
Dutch
oven
before
the
fire
;
the
pettitoes
were
getting
on
deliciously
in
a
little
tin
saucepan
on
the
hob
;
and
Mrs
Bardell
and
her
two
friends
were
getting
on
very
well
,
also
,
in
a
little
quiet
conversation
about
and
concerning
all
their
particular
friends
and
acquaintance
;
when
Master
Bardell
came
back
from
answering
the
door
,
and
delivered
the
message
intrusted
to
him
by
Mr
Samuel
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pickwick
's
servant
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
,
turning
pale
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
soul
!
"
said
Mrs
Cluppins
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
raly
would
not
ha
'
believed
it
,
unless
I
had
ha
'
happened
to
ha
'
been
here
!
"
said
Mrs
Sanders
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Cluppins
was
a
little
,
brisk
,
busy
-
looking
woman
;
Mrs
Sanders
was
a
big
,
fat
,
heavy
-
faced
personage
;
and
the
two
were
the
company
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Bardell
felt
it
proper
to
be
agitated
;
and
as
none
of
the
three
exactly
knew
whether
under
existing
circumstances
,
any
communication
,
otherwise
than
through
Dodson
&
Fogg
,
ought
to
be
held
with
Mr
Pickwick
's
servant
,
they
were
all
rather
taken
by
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
state
of
indecision
,
obviously
the
first
thing
to
be
done
,
was
to
thump
the
boy
for
finding
Mr
Weller
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
So
his
mother
thumped
him
,
and
he
cried
melodiously
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
noise
---
do
---
you
naughty
creetur
!
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
do
n't
worrit
your
poor
mother
,
"
said
Mrs
Sanders
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
quite
enough
to
worrit
her
,
as
it
is
,
without
you
,
Tommy
,
"
said
Mrs
Cluppins
,
with
sympathising
resignation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
worse
luck
,
poor
lamb
!
"
said
Mrs
Sanders
.
<EOS>
At
all
which
moral
reflections
,
Master
Bardell
howled
the
louder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
what
shall
I
do
?
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
to
Mrs
Cluppins
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
ought
to
see
him
,
"
replied
Mrs
Cluppins
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
on
no
account
without
a
witness
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
two
witnesses
would
be
more
lawful
,
"
said
Mrs
Sanders
,
who
,
like
the
other
friend
,
was
bursting
with
curiosity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
'd
better
come
in
here
,
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
replied
Mrs
Cluppins
,
eagerly
catching
at
the
idea
;
"
walk
in
,
young
man
;
and
shut
the
street
door
first
,
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
immediately
took
the
hint
;
and
presenting
himself
in
the
parlour
,
explained
his
business
to
Mrs
Bardell
thus
---
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
sorry
to

<EOS>
"
Of

the
young

help
the
faults

"
said
Mrs
Cluppins
,
much
struck
by
Mr
Weller
's
appearance
and
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
chimed
in
Mrs
Sanders
,
who
,
from
certain
wistful
glances
at
the
little
tin
saucepan
,
seemed
to
be
engaged
in
a
mental
calculation
of
the
probable
extent
of
the
pettitoes
,
in
the
event
of
Sam
's
being
asked
to
stop
to
supper
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
all
I
've
come
about
,
is
jest
this
here
,
"
said
Sam
,
disregarding
the
interruption
;
"
first
,
to
give
my
governor
's
notice
---
there
it
is
.
<EOS>
Secondly
,
to
pay
the
rent
---
here
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
Thirdly
,
to
say
as
all
his

is
to
be
put
together
,
and
give
to
anybody
as
we
sends
for
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Fourthly
,
that
you
may
let
the
place
as
soon
as
you
like
---
and
that
's
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Whatever
has
happened
,
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
,
"
I
always
have
said
,
and
always
will
say
,
that
in
every
respect
but
one
,
Mr
Pickwick
has
always
behaved
himself
like
a
perfect
gentleman
.
<EOS>
His
money
always
as
good
as
the
bank
---
always
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mrs
Bardell
said
this
,
she
applied
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
,
and
went
out
of
the
room
to
get
the
receipt
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
well
knew
that
he
had
only
to
remain
quiet
,
and
the
women
were
sure
to
talk
;
so
he
looked
alternately
at
the
tin
saucepan
,
the
toasted
cheese
,
the
wall
,
and
the
ceiling
,
in
profound
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
dear
!
"
said
Mrs
Cluppins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
"
replied
Mrs
Sanders
.
<EOS>
Sam
said
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
they
were
coming
to
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
raly
can
not
contain
myself
,
"
said
Mrs
Cluppins
,
"
when
I
think
of
such
perjury
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wish
to
say
anything
to
make
you
uncomfortable
,
young
man
,
but
your
master
's
an
old
brute
,
and
I
wish
I
had
him
here
to
tell
him
so
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
had
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
see
how
dreadful
she
takes
on
,
going
moping
about
,
and
taking
no
pleasure
in
nothing
,
except
when
her
friends
comes
in
,
out
of
charity
,
to
sit
with
her
,
and
make
her
comfortable
,
"
resumed
Mrs
Cluppins
,
glancing
at
the
tin
saucepan
and
the
Dutch
oven
,
"
it
's
shocking
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Barbareous
,
"
said
Mrs
Sanders
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
your
master
,
young
man
!
 
<EOS>
A
gentleman
with
money
,
as
could
never
feel
the
expense
of
a
wife
,
no
more
than
nothing
<EOS>
,
"
continued
Mrs
Cluppins
,
with
great
volubility
;
"
why
there
ai
n't
the
faintest
shade
of
an
excuse
for
his
behaviour
!
 
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
he
marry
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
to
be
sure
;
that
's
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Question
,
indeed
,
"
retorted
Mrs
Cluppins
,
"
she
'd
question
him
,
if
she
'd
my
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
Hows'ever
,
there
is
law
for
us
women
,
mis'rable
creeturs
as
they
'd
make
us
,
if
they
could
;
and
that
your
master
will
find
out
,
young
man
,
to
his
cost
,
afore
<EOS>
he
's
six
months
older
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
consolatory
reflection
,
Mrs
Cluppins
bridled
up
,
and
smiled
at
Mrs
Sanders
,
who
smiled
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
action
's
going
on
,
and
no
mistake
,
"
thought
Sam
,
as
Mrs
Bardell
re
-
entered
with
the
receipt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
the
receipt
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
,
"
and
here
's
the
change
,
and
I
hope
you
'll
take
a
little
drop
of
something
to
keep
the
cold
out
,
if
it
's
only
for
old
acquaintance
"
sake
,
Mr
Weller
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Sam
saw
the
advantage
he
should
gain
,
and
at
once
acquiesced
;
whereupon
Mrs
Bardell
produced
,
from
a
small
closet
,
a
black
bottle
and
a
wine
-
glass
;
and
so
great
was
her
abstraction
,
in
her
deep
mental
affliction
,
that
,
after
filling
Mr
Weller
's
glass
,
she
brought
out
three
more
wine
-
glasses
,
and
filled
them
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lauk
,
Mrs
Bardell
,
"
said
Mrs
Cluppins
,
"
see
what
you
've
been
and
done
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
that
is
a
good
one
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mrs
Sanders
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
my
poor
head
!
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
,
with
a
faint
smile
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
understood
all
this
,
of
course
,
so
he
said
at
once
,
that
he
never
could
drink
before
supper
,
unless
a
lady
drank
with
him
.
<EOS>
A
great
deal
of
laughter
ensued
,
and
Mrs
Sanders
volunteered
to
humour
him
,
so
she
took
a
slight
sip
out
of
her
glass
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Sam
said
it
must
go
all
round
,
so
they
all
took
a
slight
sip
.
 
<EOS>
Then
little
Mrs
Cluppins
proposed
as
a
toast
,
"
Success
to
Bardell
agin
Pickwick
"
;
and
then
the
ladies
emptied
their
glasses
in
honour
of
the
sentiment
,
and
got
very
talkative
directly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
've
heard
what
's
going
forward
,
Mr
Weller
?
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
heerd
somethin'
on
it
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
terrible
thing
to
be
dragged
before
the
public
,
in
that
way
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
see
now
,
that
it
's
the
only
thing
I
ought
to
do
,
and
my
lawyers
,
Mr
Dodson
and
Fogg
,
tell
me
that
,
with
the
evidence
as
we
shall
call
,
we
must
succeed

<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
I
should
do
,
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
,
if
I
did
n't
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
mere
idea
of
Mrs
Bardell
's
failing
in
her
action
,
affected
Mrs
Sanders
so
deeply
,
that
she
was
under
the
necessity
of
refilling
and
re
-
emptying
her
glass
immediately
;
feeling
,
as
she
said
afterwards
,
that
if
she
had
n't
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
do
so
,
she
must
have
dropped
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ven
is
it
expected
to
come
on
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Either
in
February
or
March

replied
Mrs
Bardell
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
a

of
witnesses
there
'll

said
Mrs

<EOS>
"
Ah

replied
Mrs

<EOS>
"
And
wo

Mr
Dodson

Fogg
be
wild
if
the
plaintiff
should
n't
get

added
Mrs
Cluppins
,
"
when
they
do
it
all
on

"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah

"
said
Mrs

.
   
<EOS>
"
But
the
plaintiff
must
get
it

"
resumed
Mrs
Cluppins
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

there
ca
n't
be
any
doubt
about
it

"
rejoined
Mrs
Sanders
.
   
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
"
said
Sam
,
rising
and
setting
down
his
glass
,
"
all
I
can
say
is
,
that
I
vish
you
MAY
get
it

"
   
<EOS>
"

continued
Mr

the

Ah

said
the
gratified
Mrs

<EOS>
"
Amen

that
,

replied
Sam

Wish

"
   
<EOS>
To
the
great
relief
of
Mrs
Sanders
,
Sam
was
allowed
to
depart
without
any
reference
,
on
the
part
of
the
hostess
,
to
the
pettitoes
and
toasted
cheese
;
to
which
the
ladies
,
with
such
juvenile
assistance
as
Master
Bardell
could
afford
,
soon
afterwards
rendered
the
amplest
justice
---
indeed
they
wholly
vanished
before
their
strenuous
exertions
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
wended
his
way
back
to
the
George
and
Vulture
,
and
faithfully
recounted
to
his
master
,
such
indications
of
the
sharp
practice
of
Dodson

Fogg
,
as
he
had
contrived
to
pick
up
in
his
visit
to
Mrs
Bardell

.
 
<EOS>
An
interview
with
Mr
Perker
,
next
day
,
more
than
confirmed
Mr
Weller
's
statement
;
and
Mr
Pickwick
was
fain
to
prepare
for
his
Christmas
visit
to
Dingley
Dell
,
with
the
pleasant
anticipation
that
some
two
or
three
months
afterwards
,
an
action
brought
against
him
for
damages
sustained
by
reason
of
a
breach
of
promise
of
marriage
,
would
be
publicly
tried
in
the
Court
of
Common
Pleas
;
the
plaintiff
having
all
the
advantages
derivable
,
not

from
the
force
of

sharp

Chapter

<EOS>
Samuel
Weller
makes
a
pilgrimage
to
Dorking
,
and
beholds
his
mother
-
in
-
law
 
There
still
remaining
an
interval
of
two
days
before
the
time
agreed
upon
for
the
departure
of
the
Pickwickians
to
Dingley
Dell
,
Mr
Weller
sat
himself
down
in
a
back
room
at
the
George
and
Vulture
,
after
eating
an
early
dinner
,
to
muse
on
the
best
way
of
disposing
of
his
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
remarkably
fine
day
;
and
he
had
not
turned
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
ten
minutes
,
when
he
was
suddenly
stricken
filial
and
affectionate
;
and
it
occurred
to
him
so
strongly
that
he
ought
to
go
down
and
see
his
father
,
and
pay
his
duty
to
his
mother
-
in
-
law
,
that
he
was
lost
in
astonishment
at
his
own
remissness
in
never
thinking
of
this
moral
obligation
before
.
 
<EOS>
Anxious
to
atone
for
his
past
neglect
without
another
hour
's
delay
<EOS>
,
he
straightway
walked
upstairs
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
requested
leave
of
absence
for
this
laudable
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
Sam
,
certainly
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
his
eyes
glistening
with
delight
at
this
manifestation
of
filial
feeling
on
the
part
of
his
attendant
;
"
certainly
,
Sam
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
made
a
grateful
bow
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
see
that
you
have
so
high
a
sense
of
your
duties
as
a
son
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
always
had
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
very
gratifying
reflection
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
approvingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
;
"
if
ever
I
wanted
anythin
'
o
'
my
father
,
I
always
asked
for
it
in
a
wery
"
spectful
and
obligin
'
manner
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
did
n't
give
it
me
,
I
took
it
,
for
fear
I
should
be
led
to
do
anythin
'
wrong
,
through
not
havin'
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
saved
him
a
world
o
'
trouble
this
vay
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
precisely
what
I
meant
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
shaking
his
head
,
with
a
slight
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
good
feelin
'
,
sir
---
the
wery
best
intentions
,
as
the
gen'l'm'n
said
ven
he
run
away
from
his
wife
"
<EOS>
cos
<EOS>
she
seemed
unhappy
with
him
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
go
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
;
and
having
made
his
best
bow
,
and
put
on
his
best
clothes
,
Sam
planted
himself
on
the
top
of
the
Arundel
coach
,
and
journeyed
on
to
Dorking
.
   
<EOS>
The
Marquis
of
Granby
,
in
Mrs
Weller
's
time
,
was
quite
a
model
of
a
roadside
public
-
house
of
the
better
class
---
just
large
enough
to
be
convenient
,
and
small
enough
to
be
snug
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
was
a
large
sign
-
board
on
a
high
post
,
representing
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
gentleman
with
an
apoplectic
countenance
,
in
a
red
coat
with
deep
blue
facings
,
and
a
touch
of
the
same
blue
over
his
three
-
cornered
hat
,
for
a
sky
.
<EOS>
Over
that
again
were
a
pair
of
flags
;
beneath
the
last
button
of
his
coat
were
a
couple
of
cannon
;
and
the
whole
formed
an
expressive
and
undoubted
likeness
of
the
Marquis
of
Granby
of
glorious
memory
.
   
<EOS>
The
bar
window
displayed
a
choice
collection
of
geranium
plants
,
and
a
well
-
dusted
row
of
spirit
phials
.
 
<EOS>
The
open
shutters
bore
a
variety
of
golden
inscriptions
,
eulogistic
of
good
beds
and
neat
wines
;
and
the
choice
group
of
countrymen
and
hostlers
lounging
about
the
stable
door
and
horse
-
trough
,
afforded
presumptive
proof
of
the
excellent
quality
of
the
ale
and
spirits
which
were

Sam
Weller
paused
,
when
he
dismounted
from
the
coach
,
to
note
all
these
little
indications
of
a
thriving
business
,
with
the
eye
of
an
experienced
traveller
;
and
having
done
so
,
stepped
in
at
once
,
highly
satisfied
with
everything
he
had
observed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
then
!
"
said
a
shrill
female
voice
the
instant
Sam
thrust
his
head
in
at
the
door
,
"
what
do
you
want
,
young
man
?
"
   
<EOS>
Sam
looked
round
in
the
direction
<EOS>
whence
the
voice
proceeded
.
<EOS>
It
came
from
a
rather
stout
lady
of
comfortable
appearance
,
who
was
seated
beside
the
fireplace
in
the
bar
,
blowing
the
fire
to
make
the
kettle
boil
for
tea
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
not
alone
;
for
on
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
,
sitting
bolt
upright
in
a
high
-
backed
chair
,
was
a
man
in
threadbare
black
clothes
,
with
a
back
almost
as
long
and
stiff
as
that
of
the
chair
itself
,
who
caught
Sam
's
most
particular
and
especial
attention
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
prim
-
faced
,
red
-
nosed
man
,
with
a
long
,
thin
countenance
,
and
a
semi
-
rattlesnake
sort
of
eye
---
rather
sharp
,
but
decidedly
bad
.
 
<EOS>
He
wore
very
short
trousers
,
and
black
cotton
stockings
,
which
,
like
the
rest
of
his
apparel
,
were
particularly
rusty
.
 
<EOS>
His
looks
were
starched
,
but
his
white
neckerchief
was
not
,
and
its
long
limp
ends
straggled
over
his
closely
-
buttoned
waistcoat
in
a
very
uncouth
and
unpicturesque
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
A
pair
of
old
,
worn
,
beaver
gloves
,
a
broad
-
brimmed
hat
,
and
a
faded
green
umbrella
,
with
plenty
of
whalebone
sticking
through
the
bottom
,
as
if
to
counterbalance
the
want
of
a
handle
at
the
top
,
lay
on
a
chair
beside
him
;
and
,
being
disposed
in
a
very
tidy
and
careful
manner
,
seemed
to
imply
that
the
red
-
nosed
man
,
whoever
he
was
,
had
no
intention
of
going
away
in
a
hurry
.
   
<EOS>
To
do
the
red
-
nosed
man
justice
,
he
would
have
been
very
far
from
wise
if
he
had
entertained
any
such
intention
;
for
,
to
judge
from
all
appearances
,
he
must
have
been
possessed
of
a
most
desirable
circle
of
acquaintance
,
if
he
could
have
reasonably
expected
to
be
more
comfortable
anywhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
The
fire
was
blazing
brightly
under
the
influence
of
the
bellows
,
and
the
kettle
was
singing
gaily
under
the
influence
of
both
.
 
<EOS>
A
small
tray
of
tea
-
things
was
arranged
on
the
table
;
a
plate
of
hot
buttered
toast
was
gently
simmering
before
the
fire
;
and
the
red
-
nosed
man
himself
was
busily
engaged
in
converting
a
large
slice
of
bread
into
the
same
agreeable
edible
,
through
the
instrumentality
of
a
long
brass
toasting
-
fork
.
 
<EOS>
Beside
him
stood
a
glass
of
reeking
hot
pine
-
apple
rum
-
and
-
water
,
with
a
slice
of
lemon
in
it
;
and
every
time
the
red
-
nosed
man
stopped
to
bring
the
round
of
toast
to
his
eye
,
with
the
view
of
ascertaining
how
it
got
on
,
he
imbibed
a
drop
or
two
of
the
hot
pine
-
apple
rum
-
and
-
water
,
and
smiled
upon
the
rather
stout
lady
,
as
she
blew
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
was
so
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
this
comfortable
scene
,
that
he
suffered
the
first
inquiry
of
the
rather
stout
lady
to
pass
unheeded
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
it
had
been
twice
repeated
,
each
time
in
a
shriller
tone
,
that
he
became
conscious
of
the
impropriety
of
his
behaviour
.
   
<EOS>
"
Governor
in
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
,
in
reply
to
the
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
he
is
n't
,
"
replied
Mrs
Weller
;
for
the
rather
stout
lady
was
no
other
than
the
quondam
relict
and
sole
executrix
of
the
dead
-
and
-
gone
Mr
Clarke
;
"
no
,
he
is
n't
,
and
I
do
n't
expect
him
,
either
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
's
drivin
'
up
to
-
day
?
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
may
be
,
or
he
may
not
,
"
replied
Mrs
Weller
,
buttering
the
round
of
toast
which
the
red
-
nosed
man
had
just
finished
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
and
,
what
's
more
,
I
do
n't
care
.
<EOS>
---
Ask
a
blessin
'
,
Mr
Stiggins
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
red
-
nosed
man
did
as
he
was
desired
,
and
instantly
commenced
on
the
toast
with
fierce
voracity
.
   
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
the
red
-
nosed
man
had
induced
Sam
,
at
first
sight
,
to
more
than
half
suspect
that
he
was
the
deputy
-
shepherd
of
whom
his
estimable
parent
had
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
The
moment
he
saw
him
eat
,
all
doubt
on
the
subject
was
removed
,
and
he
perceived
at
once
that
if
he
purposed
to
take
up
his
temporary
quarters
where
he
was
,
he
must
make
his
footing
good
without
delay
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
commenced
proceedings
by
putting
his
arm
over
the
half
-
door
of
the
bar
,
coolly
unbolting
it
,
and
leisurely
walking
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mother
-
in
-
law
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
how
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
do
believe
he
is
a
Weller
!
"
said
Mrs
W
,
raising
her
eyes
to
Sam
's
face
,
with
no
very
gratified
expression
of
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
rayther
think
he
is
,
"
said
the
imperturbable
Sam
;
"
and
I
hope
this
here
reverend
gen'l'm'n
<EOS>
"
ll
excuse
me
saying
that
I
wish
I
was
THE
Weller
as
owns
you
,
mother
-
in
-
law
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
a
double
-
barrelled
compliment
.
 
<EOS>
It
implied
that
Mrs
Weller
was
a
most
agreeable
female
,
and
also
that
Mr
Stiggins
had
a
clerical
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
It
made
a
visible
impression
at
once
;
and
Sam
followed
up
his
advantage
by
kissing
his
mother
-
in
-
law
.
   
<EOS>
"
Get
along
with
you
!
"
said
Mrs
Weller
,
pushing
him
away
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
shame
,
young
man
!
"
said
the
gentleman
with
the
red
nose
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
offence
,
sir
,
no
offence
,
"
replied
Sam
;
"
you
're
wery
right
,
though
;
it
ai
n't
the
right
sort
<EOS>
o
'
thing
,
ven
mothers
-
in
-
law
is
young
and
good
-
looking
,
is
it
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
vanity
,
"
said
Mr
Stiggins
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
so
it
is
,
"
said
Mrs
Weller
,
setting
her
cap
to
rights
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
thought
it
was
,
too
,
but
he
held
his
peace
.
   
<EOS>
The
deputy
-
shepherd
seemed
by
no
means
best
pleased
with
Sam
's
arrival
;
and
when
the
first
effervescence
of
the
compliment
had
subsided
,
even
Mrs
Weller
looked
as
if
she
could
have
spared
him
without
the
smallest
inconvenience
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
there
he
was
;
and
as
he
could
n't
be
decently
turned
out
,
they
all
three
sat
down
to
tea
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
's
father
?
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
At
this
inquiry
,
Mrs
Weller
raised
her
hands
,
and
turned
up
her
eyes
,
as
if
the
subject
were
too
painful
to
be
alluded
to
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Stiggins
groaned
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
with
that
'
ere
gen'l'm'n
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
shocked
at
the
way
your
father
goes
on
in
,
"
replied
Mrs
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
is
,
is
he
?
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
with
too
good
reason
,
"
added
Mrs
Weller
gravely
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Stiggins
took
up
a
fresh
piece
of
toast
,
and
groaned
heavily
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
dreadful
reprobate
,
"
said
Mrs
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
man
of
wrath
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Stiggins
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
a
large
semi
-
circular
bite
out
of
the
toast
,
and
groaned
again
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
felt
very
strongly
disposed
to
give
the
reverend
<EOS>
Mr
Stiggins
something
to
groan
for
,
but
he
repressed
his
inclination
,
and
merely
asked
,
"
What
's
the
old
'
un
up
to
now
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Up
to
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs
Weller
,
"
Oh
,
he
has
a
hard
heart
.
<EOS>
Night
after
night
<EOS>
does
this
excellent
man
---
do
n't
frown
,
Mr
Stiggins
;
I
WILL
say
you
ARE
an
excellent
man
---
come
and
sit
here
,
for
hours
together
,
and
it
has
not
the
least
effect
upon
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
Well
,
that
is
odd
,
"
said
Sam
;
<EOS>
"
it
'
ud
have
a
wery
considerable
effect
upon
me
,
if
I
wos
in
his
place
;
I
know
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
my
young
friend
,
"
said
Mr
Stiggins
solemnly
,
"
he
has
an
obderrate
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
young
friend
,
who
else
could
have
resisted
the
pleading
of
sixteen
of
our
fairest
sisters
,
and
withstood
their
exhortations
to
subscribe
to
our
noble
society
for
providing
the
infant
negroes
in
the
West
Indies
with
flannel
waistcoats
and
moral
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
a
moral
pocket
-
ankercher
?
"
said
Sam
;
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
one
o
'
<EOS>
them
articles
o
'
furniter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Those
which
combine
amusement
With
instruction
,
my
young
friend
,
"
replied
Mr
Stiggins
,
"
blending
select
tales
with
wood
-
cuts
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
know
,
"
said
Sam
;
"
them
as
hangs
up
in
the
linen
-
drapers
"
shops
,
with
beggars
"
petitions
and
all
that
'
ere
upon
'
em
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Stiggins
began
a
third
round
of
toast
,
and
nodded
assent
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
would
n't
be
persuaded
by
the
ladies
,
would
n't
he
?
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sat
and
smoked
his
pipe
,
and
said
the
infant
negroes
were
---
what
did
he
say
the
infant
negroes
were
?
"
said
Mrs
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Little
humbugs
,
"
replied
Mr
Stiggins
,
deeply
affected
.
   
<EOS>
"
Said
the
infant
negroes
were
little
humbugs
,
"
repeated
Mrs
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
And
they
both
groaned
at
the
atrocious
conduct
of
the
elder
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
A
great
many
more
iniquities
of
a
similar
nature
might
have
been
disclosed
,
only
the
toast
being
all
eaten
,
the
tea
having
got
very
weak
,
and
Sam
holding
out
no
indications
of
meaning
to
go
,
Mr
Stiggins
suddenly
recollected
that
he
had
a
most
pressing
appointment
with
the
shepherd
,
and
took
himself
off
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
The
tea
-
things
had
been
scarcely
put
away
,
and
the
hearth
swept
up
,
when
the
London
coach
deposited
Mr
Weller
,
senior
,
at
the
door
;
his
legs
deposited
him
in
the
bar
;
and
his
eyes
showed
him
his
son
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
Sammy
!
"
exclaimed
the
father
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
old
Nobs
!
"
ejaculated
the
son
.
 
<EOS>
And
they
shook
hands
heartily
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wery
glad
to
see
you
,
Sammy
,
"
said
the
elder
Mr
Weller
,
"
though
how
you
've
managed
to
get
over
your
mother
-
in

is
a

<EOS>
"

said
Sam
,
"

"
<EOS>
"
She

Mr

"
   
<EOS>
Saying
this
,
Mr
Weller
mixed
two
glasses
of
spirits
-
and
-
water
,
and
produced
a
couple
of
pipes
.
 
<EOS>
The
father
and
son
sitting
down
opposite
each
other
;
Sam
on
one
side
of
the
fire
,
in

high

backed
chair
,
and
Mr
Weller
,
senior
,
on
the
other
,
in
an
easy

,
they
proceeded
to
enjoy
themselves
with
all
due
gravity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Anybody

"
<EOS>
asked
Mr
Weller
,
senior
,
dryly
,
after
a
long
silence
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
nodded
an
expressive
assent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Red

inquired
Mr

Sam
nodded
again

"

Sam
intimated
by

recollected

said
Mr

lowering
his

bending
across

As
Mr
Weller
said
this
,
he
slowly
recovered
his
former
position
,
and
winked
at
his
first
-
born
,
in
a
profound
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
it
cert'nly
seems
a
queer
start
to
send
out
pocket-'ankerchers
to
people
as

observed
Sam

"
They
're

T'other
Sunday
I

I
werily

there
was
change

suv'rins
in
it

then
,
Sammy
,
all
in
ha'pence
;
and
as
the
people
come
out
,
they
rattled
the
pennies
in
it
,
till
you
'd
ha

thought
that
no

<EOS>
What
d'ye

it
was
all
for

<EOS>
"
For
another
tea
-
drinkin

,
perhaps
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
on
it

replied
the
father
;
"
for
the
shepherd

water

<EOS>
"
The
shepherd

water

rate

"
said
Sam

<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
,
"
there
was
three
quarters
owin
'
,
and
the
shepherd
had
n't
paid
a
farden
,
not
he
---
perhaps
it
might
be
on
account
that
the
water
warn't
<EOS>
o

much
use
to
him
,
for
it
's
wery
little

he

a

dozen
of

he

<EOS>
Hows'ever
,
it
warn't
paid
,
and
so
they
cuts
the
water
off
.
 
<EOS>
Down
goes
the
shepherd
to
chapel
,
gives
out
as
he
's
a
persecuted
saint
,
and
says
he
hopes
the
heart
of
the
turncock

cut
the
water
off
,
"
ll
be
softened
,
and
turned
in

right

but
he

thinks
he
's
booked

somethin'
uncomfortable

<EOS>
Upon
this

the

calls
a
meetin

,
sings
a
hymn

wotes
your

wolunteers
a
collection
next
Sunday

hands
it
all
over

the
shepherd

<EOS>
And
if

enough
out

Sammy

to
make
him
free

the
water
company

said
Mr
Weller
,
in
conclusion
,
"
I
'm
one
Dutchman
,
and
you
're
another

and
that
's
all
about

<EOS>
Mr

smoked
for
some
minutes
in
silence
,
and
then
resumed

The
worst
o

these

my

Lord

Sam

<EOS>
"
Nothin'
else

said
Mr

,
shaking
his
head
gravely
;
"

wot
aggrawates
me

is
to

labour
in

coloured

That

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
,
having
delivered
this
gentle
recipe
with
strong
emphasis
,
eked
out
by
a
variety
of
nods
and
contortions
of
the
eye
,
emptied
his
glass
at
a
draught
,
and
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
,
with
native
dignity
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
engaged
in
this
operation
,
when
a
shrill
voice
was
heard
in
the
passage
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
your
dear
relation
,
Sammy
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
;
and
Mrs
W
hurried
into
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
've
come
back

have
you

"
said
Mrs
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my

"
replied
Mr
Weller
,
filling
a
fresh
pipe
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Has
Mr

said
Mrs
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No

my
dear

he
has

"
replied
Mr
Weller
,
lighting
the
pipe
by
the
ingenious
process
of
holding
to
the
bowl
thereof
,
between
the
tongs
,
a
red
-
hot
coal
from
the
adjacent
fire
;
and
what
's
more
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
I
shall
manage
to
surwive
it
,
if
he
do
n't
come
back
at
all

"
   
<EOS>
"
Ugh

said
Mrs

.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee

said
Mr

<EOS>
"
Come

said
Sam

"

<EOS>
Here
's
the
reverend
gen'l'm'n
a
-
comin

in
now

<EOS>
"
At
this
announcement
,
Mrs
Weller
hastily
wiped
off
the
tears
which
she
had
just
begun
to
force
on
;
and
Mr
W
drew
his
chair
sullenly
into
the
chimney
-
corner
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Stiggins
was
easily
prevailed
on
to
take
another
glass
of
the
hot
pine
-
apple
rum
-
and
-
water
,
and
a
second
,
and
a
third
,
and
then
to
refresh
himself
with
a
slight
supper
,
previous
to
beginning
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
on
the
same
side
as
Mr
Weller
,
senior
;
and
every
time
he
could
contrive
to
do
so
,
unseen
by
his
wife
,
that
gentleman
indicated
to
his
son
the
hidden
emotions
of
his
bosom
,
by
shaking
his
fist
over
the
deputy
-
shepherd
's
head
;
a
process
which
afforded
his
son
the
most
unmingled
delight
and
satisfaction
,
the
more
especially
as
Mr
Stiggins
went
on
,
quietly
drinking
the
hot
pine
-
apple
rum
-
and
-
water
,
wholly
unconscious
of
what
was
going
forward
.
   
<EOS>
The
major
part
of
the
conversation
was
confined
to
Mrs
Weller
and
the
reverend
Mr
Stiggins
;
and
the
topics
principally
descanted
on
,
were
the
virtues
of
the
shepherd
,
the
worthiness
of
his
flock
,
and
the
high
crimes
and
misdemeanours
of
everybody
beside
---
dissertations
which
the
elder
Mr
Weller
occasionally
interrupted
by
half
-
suppressed
references
to
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
Walker
,
and
other
running
commentaries
of
the
same
kind
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
Mr
Stiggins
,
with
several
most
indubitable
symptoms
of
having
quite
as
much
pine
-
apple
rum
-
and
-
water
about
him
as
he
could
comfortably
accommodate
,
took
his
hat
,
and
his
leave
;
and
Sam
was
,
immediately
afterwards
,
shown
to
bed
by
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
The
respectable
old
gentleman
wrung
his
hand
fervently
,
and
seemed
disposed
to
address
some
observation
to
his
son
;
but
on
Mrs
Weller
advancing
towards
him
,
he
appeared
to
relinquish
that
intention
,
and
abruptly
bade
him
good
-
night
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
was
up
betimes
next
day
,
and
having
partaken
of
a
hasty
breakfast
,
prepared
to
return
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
set
foot
without
the
house
,
when
his
father
stood
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Goin'
,
Sammy
?
"
inquired
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Off
at
once
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
vish
you
could
muffle
that
'
ere
Stiggins
,
and
take
him
vith
you
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
ashamed
on
you
!
"
said
Sam
reproachfully
;
"
what
do
you
let
him
show
his
red
nose
in
the
Markis
o
'
Granby
at
all
,
for

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
the
elder
fixed
on
his
son
an
earnest
look
,
and
replied
,
"
<EOS>
'Cause
I
'm

Sam
,
"

"
Tar

replied
his

<EOS>
"
I
've
only
got
to
say

said
Sam
,
stopping
short
,
"
that

I
was
the
properiator

"
   
"
What
?
<EOS>
"
interposed
Mr
Weller
,
with
great
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pison
his
rum
-
and
-
water
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
No

"
said
Mr
Weller
,
shaking
his
son
eagerly
by
the
hand
,
<EOS>
"
would
you
raly
,
Sammy
-
would
you
,
though
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would

"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
be
too
hard
upon
him
at
first
.
<EOS>
I
'd
drop
him
in
the
water
-
butt
,
and
put
the
lid
on
;
and
if
I
found
he
was
insensible
to
kindness
,
I
'd
try
the
other
persvasion

"
   
<EOS>
The
elder
Mr
Weller
bestowed
a
look
of
deep
,
unspeakable
admiration
on
his
son
,
and
,
having
once
more
grasped
his
hand
,
walked
slowly
away
,
revolving
in
his
mind
the
numerous
reflections
to
which
his
advice
had
given
rise
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
looked
after
him
,
until
he
turned
a
corner
of
the
road
;
and
then
set
forward
on
his
walk
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
meditated
at
first
,
on
the
probable
consequences
of
his
own
advice
,
and
the
likelihood
of
his
father
's
adopting
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
dismissed
the
subject
from
his
mind
,
however
,
with
the
consolatory
reflection
that
time
alone
would
show
;
and
this
is
the
reflection
we
would
impress
upon
the
reader

Chapter

<EOS>
A
good
-
humoured
Christmas
chapter
,
containing
an
account
of
a
wedding
,
and
some
other
sports
beside
:
which
although
in
their
way
,
even
as
good
customs
as
marriage
itself
,
are
not
quite
so
religiously
kept
up
,
in
these
degenerate
times
 
As
brisk
as
bees
,
if
not
altogether
as
light
as
fairies
,
did
the
four
Pickwickians
assemble
on
the
morning
of
the
twenty
-
second
day
of
December
,
in
the
year
of
grace
in
which
these
,
their
faithfully
-
recorded
adventures
,
were
undertaken
and
accomplished
.
 
<EOS>
Christmas
was
close
at
hand
,
in
all
his
bluff
and
hearty
honesty
;
it
was
the
season
of
hospitality
,
merriment
,
and
open
-
heartedness
;
the
old
year
was
preparing
,
like
an
ancient
philosopher
,
to
call
his
friends
around
him
,
and
amidst
the
sound
of
feasting
and
revelry
to
pass
gently
and
calmly
away
.
 
<EOS>
Gay
and
merry
was
the
time
;
and
right
gay
and
merry
were
at
least
four
of
the
numerous
hearts
that
were
gladdened
by
its
coming
.
   
<EOS>
And
numerous
indeed
are
the
hearts
to
which
Christmas
brings
a
brief
season
of
happiness
and
enjoyment
.
 
<EOS>
How
many
families
,
whose
members
have
been
dispersed
and
scattered
far
and
wide
,
in
the
restless
struggles
of
life
,
are
then
reunited
,
and
meet
once
again
in
that
happy
state
of
companionship
and
mutual
goodwill
,
which
is
a
source
of
such
pure
and
unalloyed
delight
;
and
one
so
incompatible
with
the
cares
and
sorrows
of
the
world
,
that
the
religious
belief
of
the
most
civilised
nations
,
and
the
rude
traditions
of
the
roughest
savages
,
alike
number
it
among
the
first
joys
of
a
future
condition
of
existence
,
provided
for
the
blessed
and
happy
!
 
<EOS>
How
many
old
recollections
,
and
how
many
dormant
sympathies
,
does
Christmas
time
awaken
!
   
<EOS>
We
write
these
words
now
,
many
miles
distant
from
the
spot
at
which
,
year
after
year
,
we
met
on
that
day
,
a
merry
and
joyous
circle
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
the
hearts
that
throbbed
so
gaily
then
,
have
ceased
to
beat
;
<EOS>
many
of
the
looks
that
shone
so
brightly
then
,
have
ceased
to
glow
;
the
hands
we
grasped
,
have
grown
cold
;
the
eyes
we
sought
,
have
hid
their
lustre
in
the
grave
;
and
yet
the
old
house
,
the
room
,
the
merry
voices
and
smiling
faces
,
the
jest
,
the
laugh
,
the
most
minute
and
trivial
circumstances
connected
with
those
happy
meetings
,
crowd
upon
our
mind
at
each
recurrence
of
the
season
,
as
if
the
last
assemblage
had
been
but
yesterday
!
 
<EOS>
Happy
,
happy
Christmas
,
that
can
win
us
back
to
the
delusions
of
our
childish
days
;
that
can
recall
to
the
old
man
the
pleasures
of
his
youth
;
that
can
transport
the
sailor
and
the
traveller
,
thousands
of
miles
away
,
back
to
his
own
fireside
and
his
quiet
home
!
   
<EOS>
But
we
are
so
taken
up
and
occupied
with
the
good
qualities
of
this
saint
Christmas
,
that
we
are
keeping
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
friends
waiting
in
the
cold
on
the
outside
of
the
Muggleton
coach
,
which
they
have
just
attained
,
well
wrapped
up
in
great
-
coats
,
shawls
,
and
comforters
.
 
<EOS>
The
portmanteaus
and
carpet
-
bags
have
been
stowed
away
,
and
Mr
Weller
and
the
guard
are
endeavouring
to
insinuate
into
the
fore
-
boot
a
huge
cod
-
fish
several
sizes
too
large
for
it
---
which
is
snugly
packed
up
,
in
a
long
brown
basket
,
with
a
layer
of
straw
over
the
top
,
and
which
has
been
left
to
the
last
,
in
order
that
he
may
repose
in
safety
on
the
half
-
dozen
barrels
of
real
native
oysters
,
all
the
property
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
which
have
been
arranged
in
regular
order
at
the
bottom
of
the
receptacle
.
 
<EOS>
The
interest
displayed
in
Mr
Pickwick
's
countenance
is
most
intense
,
as
Mr
Weller
and
the
guard
try
to
squeeze
the
cod
-
fish
into
the
boot
,
first
head
first
,
and
then
tail
first
,
and
then
top
upward
,
and
then
bottom
upward
,
and
then
side
-
ways
,
and
then
long
-
ways
,
all
of
which
artifices
the
implacable
cod
-
fish
sturdily
resists
,
until
the
guard
accidentally
hits
him
in
the
very
middle
of
the
basket
,
whereupon
he
suddenly
disappears
into
the
boot
,
and
with
him
,
the
head
and
shoulders
of
the
guard
himself
,
who
,
not
calculating
upon
so
sudden
a
cessation
of
the
passive
resistance
of
the
cod
-
fish
,
experiences
a
very
unexpected
shock
,
to
the
unsmotherable
delight
of
all
the
porters
and
bystanders
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Mr
Pickwick
smiles
with
great
good
-
humour
,
and
drawing
a
shilling
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
begs
the
guard
,
as
he
picks
himself
out
of
the
boot
,
to
drink
his
health
in
a
glass
of
hot
brandy
-
and
-
water
;
at
which
the
guard
smiles
too
,
and
Messrs.
Snodgrass
,
Winkle
,
and
Tupman
,
all
smile
in
company
.
 
<EOS>
The
guard
and
Mr
Weller
disappear
for
five
minutes
,
most
probably
to
get
the
hot
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
for
they
smell
very
strongly
of
it
,
when
they
return
,
the
coachman
mounts
to
the
box
,
Mr
Weller
jumps
up
behind
,
the
Pickwickians
pull
their
coats
round
their
legs
and
their
shawls
over
their
noses
,
the
helpers
pull
the
horse
-
cloths
off
,
the
coachman
shouts
out
a
cheery
"
All
right
,
"
and
away
they
go
.
   
<EOS>
They
have
rumbled
through
the
streets
,
and
jolted
over
the
stones
,
and
at
length
reach
the
wide
and
open
country
.
 
<EOS>
The
wheels
skim
over
the
hard
and
frosty
ground
;
and
the
horses
,
bursting
into
a
canter
at
a
smart
crack
of
the
whip
,
step
along
the
road
as
if
the
load
behind
them
---
coach
,
passengers
,
cod
-
fish
,
oyster
-
barrels
,
and
all
---
were
but
a
feather
at
their
heels
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
descended
a
gentle
slope
,
and
enter
upon
a
level
,
as
compact
and
dry
as
a
solid
block
of
marble
,
two
miles
long
.
 
<EOS>
Another
crack
of
the
whip
,
and
on
they
speed
,
at
a
smart
gallop
,
the
horses
tossing
their
heads
and
rattling
the
harness
,
as
if
in
exhilaration
at
the
rapidity
of
the
motion
;
while
the
coachman
,
holding
whip
and
reins
in
one
hand
,
takes
off
his
hat
with
the
other
,
and
resting
it
on
his
knees
,
pulls
out
his
handkerchief
,
and
wipes
his
forehead
,
partly
because
he
has
a
habit
of
doing
it
,
and
partly
because
it
's
as
well
to
show
the
passengers
how
cool
he
is
,
and
what
an
easy
thing
it
is
to
drive
four
-
in
-
hand
,
when
you
have
had
as
much
practice
as
he
has
.
 
<EOS>
Having
done
this
very
leisurely
(
otherwise
the
effect
would
be
materially
impaired
)
,
he
replaces
his
handkerchief
,
pulls
on
his
hat
,
adjusts
his
gloves
,
squares
his
elbows
,
cracks
the
whip
again
,
and
on
they
speed
,
more
merrily
than
before
.
<EOS>
A
few
small
houses
,
scattered
on
either
side
of
the
road
,
betoken
the
entrance
to
some
town
or
village
.
 
<EOS>
The
lively
notes
of
the
guard
's
key
-
bugle
vibrate
in
the
clear
cold
air
,
and
wake
up
the
old
gentleman
inside
,
who
,
carefully
letting
down
the
window
-
sash
half
-
way
,
and
standing
sentry
over
the
air
,
takes
a
short
peep
out
,
and
then
carefully
pulling
it
up
again
,
informs
the
other
inside
that
they
're
going
to
change
directly
;
on
which
the
other
inside
wakes
himself
up
,
and
determines
to
postpone
his
next
nap
until
after
the
stoppage
.
 
<EOS>
Again
the
bugle
sounds
lustily
forth
,
and
rouses
the
cottager
's
wife
and
children
,
who
peep
out
at
the
house
door
,
and
watch
the
coach
till
it
turns
the
corner
,
when
they
once
more
crouch
round
the
blazing
fire
,
and
throw
on
another
log
of
wood
against
father
comes
home
;
while
father
himself
,
a
full
mile
off
,
has
just
exchanged
a
friendly
nod
with
the
coachman
,
and
turned
round
to
take
a
good
long
stare
at
the
vehicle
as
it
whirls
away
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
the
bugle
plays
a
lively
air
as
the
coach
rattles
through
the
ill
-
paved
streets
of
a
country
town
;
and
<EOS>
the
coachman
,
undoing
the
buckle
which
keeps
his
ribands
together
,
prepares
to
throw
them
off
the
moment
he
stops
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
emerges
from
his
coat
collar
,
and
looks
about
him
with
great
curiosity
;
perceiving
which
,
the
coachman
informs
Mr
Pickwick
of
the
name
of
the
town
,
and
tells
him
it
was
market
-
day
yesterday
,
both
of
which
pieces
of
information
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
retails
to
his
fellow
-
passengers
;
whereupon
they
emerge
from
their
coat
collars
too
,
and
look
about
them
also
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
,
who
sits
at
the
extreme
edge
,
with
one
leg
dangling
in
the
air
,
is
nearly
precipitated
into
the
street
,
as
the
coach
twists
round
the
sharp
corner
by
the
cheesemonger
's
shop
,
and
turns
into
the
market
-
place
;
and
before
Mr
Snodgrass
,
who
sits
next
to
him
,
has
recovered
from
his
alarm
,
they
pull
up
at
the
inn
yard
where
the
fresh
horses
,
with
cloths
on
,
are
already
waiting
.
 
<EOS>
The
coachman
throws
down
the
reins
and
gets
down
himself
,
and
the
other
outside
passengers
drop
down
also
;
except
those
who
have
no
great
confidence
in
their
ability
to
get
up
again
;
and
they
remain
where
they
are
,
and
stamp
their
feet
against
the
coach
to
warm
them
---
looking
,
with
longing
eyes
and
red
noses
,
at
the
bright
fire
in
the
inn
bar
,
and
the
sprigs
of
holly
with
red
berries
which
ornament
the
window
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
guard
has
delivered
at
the
corn
-
dealer
's
shop
,
the
brown
paper
packet
he
took
out
of
the
little
pouch
which
hangs
over
his
shoulder
by
a
leathern
strap
;
and
has
seen
the
horses
carefully
put
to
;
and
has
thrown
on
the
pavement
the
saddle
which
was
brought
from
London
on
the
coach
roof
;
and
has
assisted
in
the
conference
between
the
coachman
and
the
hostler
about
the
gray
mare
that
hurt
her
off
fore
-
leg
last
Tuesday
;
and
he
and
Mr
Weller
are
all
right
behind
,
and
the
coachman
is
all
right
in
front
,
and
the
old
gentleman
inside
,
who
has
kept
the
window
down
full
two
inches
all
this
time
,
has
pulled
it
up
again
,
and
the
cloths
are
off
,
and
they
are
all
ready
for
starting
,
except
the
"
two
stout
gentlemen
,
"
whom
the
coachman
inquires
after
with
some
impatience
.
 
<EOS>
Hereupon
the
coachman
,
and
the
guard
,
and
Sam
Weller
,
and
Mr
Winkle
,
and
Mr
Snodgrass
,
and
all
the
hostlers
,
and
every
one
of
the
idlers
,
who
are
more
in
number
than
all
the
others
put
together
,
shout
for
the
missing
gentlemen
as
loud
as
they
can
bawl
.
 
<EOS>
A
distant
response
is
heard
from
the
yard
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Tupman
come
running
down
it
,
quite
out
of
breath
,
for
they
have
been
having
a
glass
of
ale
a
-
piece
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
's
fingers
are
so
cold
that
he
has
been
full
five
minutes
before
he
could
find
the
sixpence
to
pay
for
it
.
<EOS>
The
coachman
shouts
an
admonitory
"
Now
then
,
gen'l'm'n
,
"
the
guard
re
-
echoes
it
;
the
old
gentleman
inside
thinks
it
a
very
extraordinary
thing
that
people
WILL
get
down
when
they
know
there
is
n't
time
for
it
;
Mr
Pickwick
struggles
up
on
one
side
,
Mr
Tupman
on
the
other
;
Mr
Winkle
cries
"
All
right
"
;
and
off
they
start
.
 
<EOS>
Shawls
are
pulled
up
,
coat
collars
are
readjusted
,
the
pavement
ceases
,
the
houses
disappear
;
and
they
are
once
again
dashing
along
the
open
road
,
with
the
fresh
clear
air
blowing
in
their
faces
,
and
gladdening
their
very
hearts
within
them
.
   
<EOS>
Such
was
the
progress
of
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
friends
by
the
Muggleton
Telegraph
,
on
their
way
to
Dingley
Dell
;
and
at
three
o'clock
that
afternoon
they
all
stood
high
and
dry
,
safe
and
sound
,
hale
and
hearty
,
upon
the
steps
of
the
Blue
Lion
,
having
taken
on
the
road
quite
enough
of
ale
and
brandy
,
to
enable
them
to
bid
defiance
to
the
frost
that
was
binding
up
the
earth
in
its
iron
fetters
,
and
weaving
its
beautiful
network
upon
the
trees
and
hedges
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
busily
engaged
in
counting
the
barrels
of
oysters
and
superintending
the
disinterment
of
the
cod
-
fish
,
when
he
felt
himself
gently
pulled
by
the
skirts
of
the
coat
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
round
,
he
discovered
that
the
individual
who
resorted
to
this
mode
of
catching
his
attention
was
no
other
than
Mr
Wardle
's
favourite
page
,
better
known
to
the
readers
of
this
unvarnished
history
,
by
the
distinguishing
appellation
of
the
fat
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
said
the
fat
boy
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
said
it
,
he
glanced
from
the
cod
-
fish
to
the
oyster
-
barrels
,
and
chuckled
joyously
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
fatter
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
you
look
rosy
enough
,
my
young
friend
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
asleep
,
right
in
front
of
the
taproom
fire
,
"
replied
the
fat
boy
,
who
had
heated
himself
to
the
colour
of
a
new
chimney
-
pot
,
in
the
course
of
an
hour
's
nap
.
 
<EOS>
"
Master
sent
me
over
with
the
shay
-
cart
,
to
carry
your
luggage
up
to
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
'd
ha
'
sent
some
saddle
-
horses
,
but
he
thought
you
'd
rather
walk
,
being
a
cold
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
hastily
,
for
he
remembered
how
they
had
travelled
over
nearly
the
same
ground
on
a
previous
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
we
would
rather
walk
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
Sam
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Help
Mr
Wardle
's
servant
to
put
the
packages
into
the
cart
,
and
then
ride
on
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
walk
forward
at
once
.
"
   
<EOS>
Having
given
this
direction
,
and
settled
with
the
coachman
,
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
three
friends
struck
into
the
footpath
across
the
fields
,
and
walked
briskly
away
,
leaving
Mr
Weller
and
the
fat
boy
confronted
together
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
looked
at
the
fat
boy
with
great
astonishment
,
but
without
saying
a
word
;
and
began
to
stow
the
luggage
rapidly
away
in
the
cart
,
while
the
fat
boy
stood
quietly
by
,
and
seemed
to
think
it
a
very
interesting
sort
of
thing
to
see
Mr
Weller
working
by
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
said
Sam
,
throwing
in
the
last
carpet
-
bag
,
"
there
they
are

"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes

"
said
the
fat
boy
,
in
a
very
satisfied
tone
,
"
there
they
are

"
   
<EOS>
"
Vell

<EOS>
"
Thank'ee

said
the

<EOS>
"
You

"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
as
I
knows
on

"
replied
the
fat
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
rayther
ha

thought
,
to
look
at

unrequited

The

shook
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"

said
Sam
,
"

Do

<EOS>
"
I

replied
the
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah

said
Sam
,
"
I
should
ha

s'posed
that

but
what
I
mean
is
,
should
you
like
a

I

you
never

"
   
<EOS>
"
Sometimes

replied
the
boy
;
"
and
I
likes
a

when

<EOS>
"
Oh

<EOS>
said
Sam
,
"
come
this
way

then

"
   
<EOS>
The
Blue
Lion
tap
was
soon
gained
,
and
the
fat
boy
swallowed
a
glass
of
liquor
without
so
much
as
winking
---
a
feat
which
considerably
advanced
him
in
Mr
Weller
's
good
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
having
transacted
a
similar
piece
of
business
on
his
own
account
,
they
got
into
the
cart
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
you
drive
?
"
said
the
fat
boy
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
rayther
think
so
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
then
,
"
said
the
fat
boy
,
putting
the
reins
in
his
hand
,
and
pointing
up
a
lane
,
"
it
's
as
straight
as
you
can
go
;
you
ca
n't
miss
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
the
fat
boy
laid
himself
affectionately
down
by
the
side
of
the
cod
-
fish
,
and
,
placing
an
oyster
-
barrel
under
his
head
for
a
pillow
,
fell
asleep
instantaneously
.
   
<EOS>
"

Well

<EOS>
Come
,
wake
up
,
young
dropsy
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
as
young
dropsy
evinced
no
symptoms
of
returning
animation
,
Sam
Weller
sat
himself
down
in
front
of
the
cart
,
and
starting
the
old
horse
with
a
jerk
of
the
rein
,
jogged
steadily
on
,
towards
the
Manor
Farm
.
   
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
friends
having
walked
their
blood
into
active
circulation
,
proceeded
cheerfully
on
.
 
<EOS>
The
paths
were
hard
;
the
grass
was
crisp
and
frosty
;
the
air
had
a
fine
,
dry
,
bracing
coldness
;
and
the
rapid
approach
of
the
gray
twilight
<EOS>
(
slate
-
coloured
is
a
better
term
in
frosty
weather
)
made
them
look
forward
with
pleasant
anticipation
to
the
comforts
which
awaited
them
at
their
hospitable
entertainer
's
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
sort
of
afternoon
that
might
induce
a
couple
of
elderly
gentlemen
,
in
a
lonely
field
,
to
take
off
their
greatcoats
and
play
at
leap
-
frog
in
pure
lightness
of
heart
and
gaiety
;
and
we
firmly
believe
that
had
Mr
Tupman
at
that
moment
<EOS>
proffered
"
a
back
,
"
Mr
Pickwick
would
have
accepted
his
offer
with
the
utmost
avidity
.
   
<EOS>
However
,
Mr
Tupman
did
not
volunteer
any
such
accommodation
,
and
the
friends
walked
on
,
conversing
merrily
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
turned
into
a
lane
they
had
to
cross
,
the
sound
of
many
voices
burst
upon
their
ears
;
and
before
they
had
even
had
time
to
form
a
guess
to
whom
they
belonged
,
they
walked
into
the
very
centre
of
the
party
who
were
expecting
their
arrival
---
a
fact
which
was
first
notified
to
the
Pickwickians
,
by
the
loud
"
Hurrah
,
"
which
burst
from
old
Wardle
's
lips
,
when
they
appeared
in
sight
.
   
<EOS>
First
,
there
was
Wardle
himself
,
looking
,
if
that
were
possible
,
more
jolly
than
ever
;
then
there
were
Bella
and
her
faithful
Trundle
;
and
,
lastly
,
there
were
Emily
and
some
eight
or
ten
young
ladies
,
who
had
all
come
down
to
the
wedding
,
which
was
to
take
place
next
day
,
and
who
were
in
as
happy
and
important
a
state
as
young
ladies
usually
are
,
on
such
momentous
occasions
;
and
they
were
,
one
and
all
,
startling
the
fields
and
lanes
,
far
and
wide
,
with
their
frolic
and
laughter
.
   
<EOS>
The
ceremony
of
introduction
,
under
such
circumstances
,
was
very
soon
performed
,
or
we
should
rather
say
that
the
introduction
was
soon
over
,
without
any
ceremony
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
In
two
minutes
thereafter
,
Mr
Pickwick
was
joking
with
the
young
ladies
who
would
n't
come
over
the
stile
while
he
looked
---
or
who
,
having
pretty
feet
and
unexceptionable
ankles
,
preferred
standing
on
the
top
rail
for
five
minutes
or
so
,
declaring
that
they
were
too
frightened
to
move
---
with
as
much
ease
and
absence
of
reserve
or
constraint
,
as
if
he
had
known
them
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
worthy
of
remark
,
too
,
that
Mr
Snodgrass
offered
Emily
far
more
assistance
than
the
absolute
terrors
of
the
stile
(
although
it
was
full
three
feet
high
,
and
had
only
a
couple
of
stepping
-
stones
)
<EOS>
would
seem
to
require
;
while
one
black
-
eyed
young
lady
in
a
very
nice
little
pair
of
boots
with
fur
round
the
top
,
was
observed
to
scream
very
loudly
,
when
Mr
Winkle
offered
to
help
her
over
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
was
very
snug
and
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
the
difficulties
of
the
stile
were
at
last
surmounted
,
and
they
once
more
entered
on
the
open
field
,
old
Wardle
informed
Mr
Pickwick
how
they
had
all
been
down
in
a
body
to
inspect
the
furniture
and
fittings
-
up
of
the
house
,
which
the
young
couple
were
to
tenant
,
after
the
Christmas
holidays
;
at
which
communication
Bella
and
Trundle
both
coloured
up
,
as
red
as
the
fat
boy
after
the
taproom
fire
;
and
the
young
lady
with
the
black
eyes
and
the
fur
round
the
boots
,
whispered
something
in
Emily
's
ear
,
and
then
glanced
archly
at
Mr
Snodgrass
;
to
which
Emily
responded
that
she
was
a
foolish
girl
,
but
turned
very
red
,
notwithstanding
;
and
Mr
Snodgrass
,
who
was
as
modest
as
all
great
geniuses
usually
are
,
felt
the
crimson
rising
to
the
crown
of
his
head
,
and
devoutly
wished
,
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
his
own
heart
,
that
the
young
lady
aforesaid
,
with
her
black
eyes
,
and
her
archness
,
and
her
boots
with
the
fur
round
the
top
,
were
all
comfortably
deposited
in
the
adjacent
county
.
   
<EOS>
But
if
they
were
social
and
happy
outside
the
house
,
what
was
the
warmth
and
cordiality
of
their
reception
when
they
reached
the
farm
!
 
<EOS>
The
very
servants
grinned
with
pleasure
at
sight
of
Mr
Pickwick
;
and
Emma
bestowed
a
half
-
demure
,
half
-
impudent
,
and
all
-
pretty
look
of
recognition
,
on
Mr
Tupman
,
which
was
enough
to
make
the
statue
of
Bonaparte
in
the
passage
,
unfold
his
arms
,
and
clasp
her
within
them
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
lady
was
seated
with
customary
state
in
the
front
parlour
,
but
she
was
rather
cross
,
and
,
by
consequence
,
most
particularly
deaf
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
went
out
herself
,
and
like
a
great
many
other
old
ladies
of
the
same
stamp
,
she
was
apt
to
consider
it
an
act
of
domestic
treason
,
if
anybody
else
took
the
liberty
of
doing
what
she
could
n't
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
bless
her
old
soul
,
she
sat
as
upright
as
she
could
,
in
her
great
chair
,
and
looked
as
fierce
as
might
be
 
---
and
that
was
benevolent
after
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
said
Wardle
,
"
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
You
recollect
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
replied
the
old
lady
,
with
great
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
trouble
Mr
Pickwick
about
an
old
creetur
like
me
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
cares
about
me
now
,
and
it
's
very
nat'ral
<EOS>
they
should
n't
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
the
old
lady
tossed
her
head
,
and
smoothed
down
her
lavender
-
coloured
silk
dress
with
trembling
hands
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
let
you
cut
an
old
friend
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
come
down
expressly
to
have
a
long
talk
,
and
another
rubber
with
you
;
and
we
'll
show
these
boys
and
girls
how
to
dance
a
minuet
,
before
they
're
eight
-
and
-
forty
hours
older
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
lady
was
rapidly
giving
way
,
but
she
did
not
like
to
do
it
all
at
once
;
so
she
only
said
,
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
hear
him
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
mother
,
"
said
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
do
n't
be
cross
,
there
's
a
good
soul
.
 
<EOS>
Recollect
Bella
;
come
,
you
must
keep
her
spirits
up
,
poor
girl
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
good
old
lady
heard
this
,
for
her
lip
quivered
as
her
son
said
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
age
has
its
little
infirmities
of
temper
,
and
she
was
not
quite
brought
round
yet
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
she
smoothed
down
the
lavender
-
coloured
dress
again
,
and
turning
to
Mr
Pickwick
said
,
"
Ah
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
young
people
was
very
different
,
when
I
was
a
girl
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
doubt
of
that
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
and
that
's
the
reason
why
I
would
make
much
of
the
few
that
have
any
traces
of
the
old
stock
"
---
and
saying
this
,
Mr
Pickwick
gently
pulled
Bella
towards
him
,
and
bestowing
a
kiss
upon
her
forehead
,
bade
her
sit
down
on
the
little
stool
at
her
grandmother
's
feet
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
expression
of
her
countenance
,
as
it
was
raised
towards
the
old
lady
's
face
,
called
up
a
thought
of
old
times
,
or
whether
the
old
lady
was
touched
by
Mr
Pickwick
's
affectionate
good
-
nature
,
or
whatever
was
the
cause
,
she
was
fairly
melted
;
so
she
threw
herself
on
her
granddaughter
's
neck
,
and
all
the
little
ill
-
humour
evaporated
in
a
gush
of
silent
tears
.
   
<EOS>
A
happy
party
they
were
,
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
Sedate
and
solemn
were
the
score
of
rubbers
in
which
Mr
Pickwick
and
the
old
lady
played
together
;
uproarious
was
the
mirth
of
the
round
table
.
<EOS>
Long
after
the
ladies
had
retired
,
did
the
hot
elder
wine
,
well
qualified
with
brandy
and
spice
,
go
round
,
and
round
,
and
round
again
;
and
sound
was
the
sleep
and
pleasant
<EOS>
were
the
dreams
that
followed
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
those
of
Mr
Snodgrass
bore
constant
reference
to
Emily
Wardle
;
and
that
the
principal
figure
in
Mr
Winkle
's
visions
was
a
young
lady
with
black
eyes
,
and
arch
smile
,
and
a
pair
of
remarkably
nice
boots
with
fur
round
the
tops
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
awakened
early
in
the
morning
,
by
a
hum
of
voices
and
a
pattering
of
feet
,
sufficient
to
rouse
even
the
fat
boy
from
his
heavy
slumbers
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
.
 
<EOS>
The
female
servants
and
female
visitors
were
running
constantly
to
and
fro
;
and
there
were
such
multitudinous
demands
for
hot
water
,
such
repeated
outcries
for
needles
and
thread
,
and
so
many
half
-
suppressed
entreaties
of
"
Oh
,
do
come
and
tie
me
,
there
's
a
dear
!
"
<EOS>
that
Mr
Pickwick
in
his
innocence
began
to
imagine
that
something
dreadful
must
have
occurred
---
when
he
grew
more
awake
,
and
remembered
the
wedding
.
 
<EOS>
The
occasion
being
an
important
one
,
he
dressed
himself
with
peculiar
care
,
and
descended
to
the
breakfast
-
room
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
all
the
female
servants
in
a
bran
new
uniform
of
pink
muslin
gowns
with
white
bows
in
their
caps
,
running
about
the
house
in
a
state
of
excitement
and
agitation
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
lady
was
dressed
out
in
a
brocaded
gown
,
which
had
not
seen
the
light
for
twenty
years
,
saving
and
excepting
such
truant
rays
as
had
stolen
through
the
chinks
in
the
box
in
which
it
had
been
laid
by
,
during
the
whole
time
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Trundle
was
in
high
feather
and
spirits
,
but
a
little
nervous
withal
.
 
<EOS>
The
hearty
old
landlord
was
trying
to
look
very
cheerful
and
unconcerned
,
but
failing
signally
in
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
All
the
girls
were
in
tears
and
white
muslin
,
except
a
select
two
or
three
,
who
were
being
honoured
with
a
private
view
of
the
bride
and
bridesmaids
,
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
Pickwickians
were
in
most
blooming
array
;
and
there
was
a
terrific
roaring
on
the
grass
in
front
of
the
house
,
<EOS>
occasioned
by
all
the
men
,
boys
,
and
hobbledehoys
attached
to
the
farm
,
each
of
whom
had
got
a
white
bow
in
his
button
-
hole
,
and
all
of
whom
were
cheering
with
might
and
main
;
being
incited
thereto
,
and
stimulated
therein
by
the
precept
and
example
of
Mr
Samuel
Weller
,
who
had
managed
to
become
mighty
popular
already
,
and
was
as
much
at
home
as
if
he
had
been
born
on
the
land
.
   
<EOS>
A
wedding
is
a
licensed
subject
to
joke
upon
,
but
there
really
is
no
great
joke
in
the
matter
after
all
;
---
we
speak
merely
of
the
ceremony
,
and
beg
it
to
be
distinctly
understood
that
we
indulge
in
no
hidden
sarcasm
upon
a
married
life
.
 
<EOS>
Mixed
up
with
the
pleasure
and
joy
of
the
occasion
,
are
the
many
regrets
at
quitting
home
,
the
tears
of
parting
between
parent
and
child
,
the
consciousness
of
leaving
the
dearest
and
kindest
friends
of
the
happiest
portion
of
human
life
,
to
encounter
its
cares
and
troubles
with
others
still
untried
and
little
known
---
natural
feelings
which
we
would
not
render
this
chapter
mournful
by
describing
,
and
which
we
should
be
still
more
unwilling
to
be
supposed
to
ridicule
.
   
<EOS>
Let
us
briefly
say
,
then
,
that
the
ceremony
was
performed
by
the
old
clergyman
,
in
the
parish
church
of
Dingley
Dell
,
and
that
Mr
Pickwick
's
name
is
attached
to
the
register
,
still
preserved
in
the
vestry
thereof
;
that
the
young
lady
with
the
black
eyes
signed
her
name
in
a
very
unsteady
and
tremulous
manner
;
that
Emily
's
signature
,
as
the
other
bridesmaid
,
is
nearly
illegible
;
that
it
all
went
off
in
very
admirable
style
;
that
the
young
ladies
generally
thought
it
far
less
shocking
than
they
had
expected
;
and
that
although
the
owner
of
the
black
eyes
and
the
arch
smile
informed
Mr
Wardle
that
she
was
sure
she
could
never
submit
to
anything
so
dreadful
,
we
have
the
very
best
reasons
for
thinking
she
was
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
To
all
this
,
we
may
add
,
that
Mr
Pickwick
was
the
first
who
saluted
the
bride
,
and
that
in
so
doing
he
threw
over
her
neck
a
rich
gold
watch
and
chain
,
which
no
mortal
eyes
<EOS>
but
the
jeweller
's
had
ever
beheld
before
.
<EOS>
Then
,
the
old
church
bell
rang
as
gaily
as
it
could
,
and
they
all
returned
to
breakfast
.
<EOS>
"
Vere
does
the
mince
-
pies
go
,
young
opium
-
eater
?
"
said
Mr
Weller
to
the
fat
boy
,
as
he
assisted
in
laying
out
such
articles
of
consumption
as
had
not
been
duly
arranged
on
the
previous
night
.
   
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
pointed
to
the
destination
of
the
pies
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
good
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
stick
a
bit
<EOS>
o
'
Christmas
in
'em

<EOS>
T'other

<EOS>
There
;
now
we
look
compact
and
comfortable
,
as
the
father
said
ven
he
cut
his
little
boy
's
head
off
,
to
cure
him
o
'
squintin
'
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Weller
made
the
comparison
,
he
fell
back
a
step
or
two
,
to
give
full
effect
to
it
,
and
surveyed
the
preparations
with
the
utmost
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wardle
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
all
seated
,

"
I
shall
be
delighted

Wardle

<EOS>
"
Joe

he
's
gone

"
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
ai
n't
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
fat
boy
,
starting
up
from
a
remote
corner
,
where
,
like
the
patron
saint
of
fat
boys
---
the
immortal
Horner
---
he
had
been
devouring
a
Christmas
pie
,
though
not
with
the
coolness
and
deliberation
which
characterised
that
young
gentleman
's
proceedings
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fill
Mr
Pickwick
's
glass
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
filled
Mr
Pickwick
's
glass
,
and
then
retired
behind
his
master
's
chair
,
<EOS>
from
whence
he
watched
the
play
of
the
knives
and
forks
,
and
the
progress
of
the
choice
morsels
from
the
dishes
to
the
mouths
of
the
company
,
with
a
kind
of
dark
and
gloomy
joy
that
was
most
impressive
.
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
old
fellow
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Same
to
you
,
my
boy
,
"
replied
Wardle
;
and
they
pledged
each
other
,
heartily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Wardle
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
we
old
folks
must
have
a
glass
of
wine
together
,
in
honour
of
this
joyful
event
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
lady
was
in
a
state
of
great
grandeur
just
then
,
for
she
was
sitting
at
the
top
of
the
table
in
the
brocaded
gown
,
with
her
newly
-
married
granddaughter
on
one
side
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
on
the
other
,
to
do
the
carving
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
had
not
spoken
in
a
very
loud
tone
,
but
she
understood
him
at
once
,
and
drank
off
a
full
glass
of
wine
to
his
long
life
and
happiness
;
after
which
the
worthy
old
soul
launched
forth
into
a
minute
and
particular
account
of
her
own
wedding
,
with
a
dissertation
on
the
fashion
of
wearing
high
-
heeled
shoes
,
and
some
particulars
concerning
the
life
and
adventures
of
the
beautiful
Lady
Tollimglower
,
deceased
;
at
all
of
which
the
old
lady
herself
laughed
very
heartily
indeed
,
and
so
did
the
young
ladies
too
,
for
they
were
wondering
among
themselves
what
on
earth
<EOS>
grandma
was
talking
about
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
laughed
,
the
old
lady
laughed
ten
times
more
heartily
,
and
said
that
these
always
had
been
considered
capital
stories
,
which
caused
them
all
to
laugh
again
,
and
put
the
old
lady
into
the
very
best
of
humours
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
cake
was
cut
,
and
passed
through
the
ring
;
the
young
ladies
saved
pieces
to
put
under
their
pillows
to
dream
of
their
future
husbands
on
;
and
a
great
deal
of
blushing
and
merriment
was
thereby
occasioned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Miller
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
to
his
old
acquaintance
,
the
hard
-
headed
gentleman
,
"
a
glass
of
wine
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
great
satisfaction
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
replied
the
hard
-
headed
gentleman
solemnly
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
take
me
in
?
"
said
the
benevolent
old
clergyman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
me
,
"
interposed
his
wife
.
"
<EOS>
And
me
,
and
me
,
"
said
a
couple
of
poor
relations
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
,
who
had
eaten
and
drunk
very
heartily
,
and
laughed
at
everything
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
expressed
his
heartfelt
delight
at
every
additional
suggestion
;
and
his
eyes
beamed
with
hilarity
and
cheerfulness
.
<EOS>
"
Ladies
and
gentlemen
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
suddenly
rising
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hear
,
hear
!
 
<EOS>
Hear
,
hear

<EOS>
Hear

"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Weller
,
in
the
excitement
of
his
feelings
.
   
<EOS>
"
Call
in
all
the
servants
,
"
cried
old
Wardle
,
interposing
to
prevent
the
public
rebuke
which
Mr
Weller
would
otherwise
most
indubitably
have
received
from
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
them
a
glass
of
wine
each
to
drink
the
toast
in
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Pickwick
.
"
   
<EOS>
Amidst
the
silence
of
the
company
,
the
whispering
of
the
women
-
servants
,
and
the
awkward
embarrassment
of
the
men
,
Mr
Pickwick
proceeded
---
   
"
Ladies
and
gentlemen
---
<EOS>
no
,
I
wo
n't
say
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
I
'll
call
you
my
friends
,
my
dear
friends
,
if
the
ladies
will
allow
me
to
take
so
great
a
liberty
---
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Pickwick
was
interrupted
by
immense
applause
from
the
ladies
,
echoed
by
the
gentlemen
,
during
which
the
owner
of
the
eyes
was
distinctly
heard
to
state
that
she
could
kiss
that
dear
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
Mr
Winkle
gallantly
inquired
if
it
could
n't
be
done
by
deputy
:
to
which
the
young
lady
with
the
black
eyes
replied
"
Go
away
,
"
and
accompanied
the
request
with
a
look
which
said
as
plainly
as
a
look
could
do
,
"
if
you
can
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friends
,
"
resumed
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
I
am
going
to
propose
the
health
of
the
bride

bridegroom
<EOS>

God
bless
'em

<EOS>
My
young
friend

Trundle
<EOS>
,
I
believe
to
be
a
very
excellent
and
manly
fellow
;
and
his
wife
<EOS>
I
know
to
be
a
very
amiable

lovely
girl
,
well
qualified
to
transfer
to
another
sphere
of
action
the
happiness
which
for
twenty
years
she
has
diffused
around
her
,
in
her
father
's
house

<EOS>
(
Here
,
the
fat
boy
burst
forth
into
stentorian
blubberings
,
and
was
led
forth
by
the
coat
collar
,
by
Mr
Weller
.
)
<EOS>
I
wish
,
"
added
Mr
Pickwick
---
"
<EOS>
I
wish
I
was
young
enough
to
be
her
sister
's
husband
(
cheers
)
,
but
,
failing
that
,
I
am
happy
to
be
old
enough
to
be
her
father
;
for
,
being
so
,
I
shall
not
be
suspected
of
any
latent
designs
when
I
say
,
that
I
admire

esteem
,
and
love
them
both
(
cheers
and
sobs
)

<EOS>
The
bride
's
father
,
our
good
friend
there
,
is
a
noble
person
,
and
I
am
proud
to
know
him

great
uproar

<EOS>
He
is
a
kind

excellent

independent

spirited

fine

hearted

hospitable

liberal
man

enthusiastic
shouts
from
the
poor
relations
,
at
all
the
adjectives
;
and
especially
at
the
two
last
)
.
 
<EOS>
That
his
daughter
may
enjoy
all
the
happiness
,
even
he
can
desire
;
and
that
he
may
derive
from
the
contemplation
of
her
felicity
all
the
gratification
of
heart
and
peace
of
mind
which
he
so
well
deserves
,
is
,
I
am
persuaded
,
our
united
wish

<EOS>
So
,
let
us
drink
their
healths
,
and
wish
them
prolonged
life

and
every
blessing

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
concluded
amidst
a
whirlwind
of
applause
;
and
once
more
were
the
lungs
of
the
supernumeraries
,
under
Mr
Weller
's
command
,
brought
into
active
and
efficient
operation
.
<EOS>
Mr
Wardle
proposed
Mr
Pickwick
;
Mr
Pickwick
proposed
the
old
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
proposed
Mr
Wardle
;
Mr
Wardle
proposed
Mr
Snodgrass
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
poor
relations
proposed
Mr
Tupman
,
and
the
other
poor
relation
proposed
Mr
Winkle
;
all
was
happiness
and
festivity
,
until
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
both
the
poor
relations
beneath
the
table
,
warned
the
party
that
it
was
time
to
adjourn
.
   
<EOS>
At
dinner
they
met
again
,
after
a
five
-
and
-
twenty
mile
walk
,
undertaken
by
the
males
at
Wardle
's
recommendation
,
to
get
rid
of
the
effects
of
the
wine
at
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
relations
had
kept
in
bed
all
day
,
with
the
view
of
attaining
the
same
happy
consummation
,
but
,
as
they
had
been
unsuccessful
,
they
stopped
there
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
kept
the
domestics
in
a
state
of
perpetual
hilarity
;
and
the
fat
boy
divided
his
time
into
small
alternate
allotments
of
eating
and
sleeping
.
   
<EOS>
The
dinner
was
as
hearty
an
affair
as
the
breakfast
,
and
was
quite
as
noisy
,
without
the
tears
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
the
dessert
and
some
more
toasts
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
the
tea
and
coffee
;
and
then
,
the
ball
.
   
<EOS>
The
best
sitting
-
room
at
Manor
Farm
was
a
good
,
long
,
dark
-
panelled
room
with
a
high
chimney
-
piece
,
and
a
capacious
chimney
,
up
which
you
could
have
driven
one
of
the
new
patent
cabs
,
wheels
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
upper
end
of
the
room
,
seated
in
a
shady
bower
of
holly
and
evergreens
were
the
two
best
fiddlers
,
and
the
only
harp
,
in
all
Muggleton
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
sorts
of
recesses
,
and
on
all
kinds
of
brackets
,
stood
massive
old
silver
candlesticks
with
four
branches
each
.
 
<EOS>
The
carpet
was
up
,
the
candles
burned
bright
,
the
fire
blazed
and
crackled
on
the
hearth
,
and
merry
voices
and
light
-
hearted
laughter
rang
through
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
of
the
old
English
yeomen
had
turned
into
fairies
when
they
died
,
it
was
just
the
place
in
which
they
would
have
held
their
revels
.
   
<EOS>
If
anything
could
have
added
to
the
interest
of
this
agreeable
scene
,
it
would
have
been
the
remarkable
fact
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
appearing
without
his
gaiters
,
for
the
first
time
within
the
memory
of
his
oldest
friends
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
mean
to
dance
?
"
said
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
do
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
see
I
am
dressed
for
the
purpose
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
called
attention
to
his
speckled
silk
stockings
,
and
smartly
tied
pumps
.
   
<EOS>
"
YOU
in
silk
stockings
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Tupman
jocosely
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
why
not
,
sir
---
why
not
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
turning
warmly
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
of
course
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
n't
wear
them
,
"
responded
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
imagine
not
,
sir
---
I
imagine
not
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
in
a
very
peremptory
tone
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
had
contemplated
a
laugh
,
but
he
found
it
was
a
serious
matter
;
so
he
looked
grave
,
and
said
they
were
a
pretty
pattern
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
they
are
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
fixing
his
eyes
upon
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
stockings
,
AS
stockings
,
I
trust
,
Sir
?
"
   
"
Certainly
not
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
certainly
not
,
"
replied
Mr
Tupman
.
 
<EOS>
He
walked
away
;
and
Mr
Pickwick
's
countenance
resumed
its
customary
benign
expression
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
all
ready
,
I
believe
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
was
stationed
with
the
old
lady
at
the
top
of
the
dance
,
and
had
already
made
four
false
starts
,
in
his
excessive
anxiety
to
commence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
begin
at
once
,
"
said
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
!
"
   
Up
struck
the
two
fiddles
and
the
one
harp
,
and
off
went
Mr
Pickwick
into
hands
across
,
when
there
was
a
general
clapping
of
hands
,
and
a
cry
of
"
Stop
,
stop
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
was
only
brought
to
,
by
the
fiddles
and
harp
desisting
,
and
could
have
been
stopped
by
no
other
earthly
power
,
if
the
house
had
been
on
fire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
's
Arabella
Allen
?
<EOS>
"
cried
a
dozen
voices
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
Winkle
?
"
added
Mr
Tupman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
we
are
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
that
gentleman
,
emerging
with
his
pretty
companion
from
the
corner
;
as
he
did
so
,
it
would
have
been
hard
to
tell
which
was
the
redder
in
the
face
,
he
or
the
young
lady
with
the
black
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
an
extraordinary
thing
it
is
,
Winkle
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
rather
pettishly
,
"
that
you
could
n't
have
taken
your
place
before
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
extraordinary
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
a
very
expressive
smile
,
as
his
eyes
rested
on
Arabella
,
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
do
n't
know
that
it
WAS
extraordinary
,
either
,
after
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
However
,
there
was
no
time
to
think
more
about
the
matter
,
for
the
fiddles
and
harp
began
in
real
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
Away
went
Mr
Pickwick
---
hands
across
---
down
the
middle
to
the
very
end
of
the
room
,
and
half
-
way
up
the
chimney
,
back
again
to
the
door
---
poussette
everywhere
---
<EOS>
loud
stamp
on
the
ground
---
ready
for
the
next
couple
---
off
again
<EOS>
---
all
the
figure
over
once
more
---
another
stamp
to
beat
out
the
time
---
next
couple
,
and
the
next
,
and
the
next
again
---
never
was
such
going
;
at
last
,
after
they
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
dance
,
and
full
fourteen
couple
after
the
old
lady
had
retired
in
an
exhausted
state
,
and
the
clergyman
's
wife
had
been
substituted
in
her
stead
,
did
that
gentleman
,
when
there
was
no
demand
whatever
on
his
exertions
,
keep
perpetually
dancing
in
his
place
,
to
keep
time
to
the
music
,
smiling
on
his
partner
all
the
while
with
a
blandness
of
demeanour
which
baffles
all
description
.
   
<EOS>
Long
before
Mr
Pickwick
was
weary
of
dancing
,
the
newly
-
married
couple
had
retired
from
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
glorious
supper
downstairs
,
notwithstanding
,
and
a
good
long
sitting
after
it
;
and
when
Mr
Pickwick
awoke
,
late
the
next
morning
,
he
had
a
confused
recollection
of
having
,
severally
and
confidentially
,
invited
somewhere
about
five
-
and
-
forty
people
to
dine
with
him
at
the
George
and
Vulture
,
the
very
first
time
they
came
to
London
;
which
Mr
Pickwick
rightly
considered
a
pretty
certain
indication
of
his
having
taken
something
besides
exercise
,
on

previous
night

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
your
family
has
games
in
the
kitchen
to
-
night
,
my
dear
,
has
they
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
of
Emma
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
replied
Emma
;
"
we
always
have
on
Christmas
Eve
.
 
<EOS>
Master
would
n't
neglect
to
keep
it
up
on
any
account
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
master
's
a
wery
pretty
notion
of
keeping
anythin
'
up
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
;
"
I
never
see
such
a
sensible
sort
of
man
as
he
is
,
or
such
a
reg'lar
gen'l'm'n
.
"
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
he
is
!
"
said
the
fat
boy
,
joining
in
the
conversation
;
"
do
n't
he
breed
nice
pork
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
fat
youth
gave
a
semi
-
cannibalic
leer
at
Mr
Weller
,
as
he
thought
of
the
roast
legs
and
gravy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
've
woke
up
,
at
last
,
have
you
?
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
nodded
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
,
young
boa
-
constructer
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
impressively
;
"
if
you
do
n't
sleep
a
little
less
,
and
exercise
a
little
more
,
wen
you
comes
to
be
a
man
you
'll
lay
yourself
open
to
the
same
sort
of
personal
inconwenience
as
was
inflicted
on
the
old
gen'l'm'n
as
wore
the
pigtail
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
they
do
to
him
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
fat
boy
,
in
a
faltering
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
-
going
to
tell
you
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
;
"
he
was
one
o
'
the
largest
patterns
as
was
ever
turned
out
---
reg'lar
fat
man
,
as
had
n't
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
own
shoes
for
five
-
and
-
forty
year
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Lor
!
"
exclaimed
Emma
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
that
he
had
n't
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
;
"
and
if
you
'd
put
an
exact
model
of
his
own
legs
on
the
dinin'-table
afore
him
<EOS>
,
he
would
n't
ha
'
known
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
he
always
walks
to
his
office
with
a
wery
handsome
gold
watch
-
chain
hanging
out
,
about
a
foot
and
a
quarter
,
and
a
gold
watch
in
his
fob
pocket
as
was
worth
<EOS>
---
I
'm
afraid
to
say
how
much
,
but
as
much
as
a
watch
can
be
---
a
large
,
heavy
,
round
manufacter
,
as
stout
for
a
watch
,
as
he
was
for
a
man
,
and
with
a
big
face
in
proportion
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
not
carry
that
'
ere
watch
,
"
says
the
old
gen'l'm'n
's
friends
,
"
you
'll
be
robbed
on
it
,
"
says
they
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
?
"
says
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
will
,
"
says
they
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
says
he
,
"
I
should
like
to
see
the
thief
as
could
get
this
here
<EOS>
watch
out
,
for
I
'm
blessed
<EOS>
if
I
ever
can
,
it
's
such
a
tight
fit
,
"
says
he
,
"
and
wenever
I
vants
to
know
what
's
o'clock
<EOS>
,
I
'm
obliged
to
stare
into
the
bakers
"
shops
,
"
he
says
.
<EOS>
Well
,
then
he
laughs
as
hearty
as
if
he
was
a
-
goin
'
to
pieces
,
and
out
<EOS>
he
walks
agin
with
his
powdered
head
and
pigtail
,
and
rolls
down
the
Strand
with
the
chain
hangin
'
out
furder
than
ever
,
and
the
great
round
watch
almost
bustin
'
through
his
gray
kersey
smalls
.
 
<EOS>
There
warn't
<EOS>
a
pickpocket
in
all
London
as
did
n't
take
a
pull
at
that
chain
,
but
the
chain
'
ud
never
break
,
and
the
watch
'
ud
never
come
out
<EOS>
,
so
they
soon
got
tired
of
dragging
such
a
heavy
old
gen'l'm'n
along
the
pavement
,
and
he
'd
go
home
and
laugh
till
the
pigtail
wibrated
like
the
penderlum
of
a
Dutch
clock
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
one
day
the
old
gen'l'm'n
was
a
-
rollin
'
along
,
and
he
sees
a
pickpocket
as
he
know'd
by
sight
,
a
-
coming
up
,
arm
in
arm
with
a
little
boy
with
a
wery
large
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
game
,
"
says
the
old
gen'l'm'n
to
himself
,
"
they
're
a
-
goin
'
to
have
another
try
,
but
it
wo
n't
do
!
"
<EOS>
So
he
begins
a
-
chucklin
'
wery
hearty
,
wen
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
the
little
boy
leaves
hold
of
the
pickpocket
's
arm
,
and
rushes
head
foremost
straight
into
the
old
gen'l'm'n
's
stomach
,
and
for
a
moment
doubles
him
right
up
with
the
pain
.
 
<EOS>
"
Murder
!
"
says
the
old
gen'l'm'n
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
Sir
,
"
says
the
pickpocket
,
a
-
wisperin
'
in
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
And
wen
he
come
straight
agin
,
the
watch
and
chain
was
gone
,
and
what
's
worse
than
that
<EOS>
,
the
old
gen'l'm'n
's
digestion
was
all
wrong
ever
afterwards
,
to
the
wery
last
day
of
his
life
;
so
just
you
look
about
you
,
young
feller
,
and
take
care
<EOS>
you
do
n't
get
too
fat
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Weller
concluded
this
moral
tale
,
with
which
the
fat
boy
appeared
much
affected
,
they
all
three
repaired
to
the
large
kitchen
,
in
which
the
family
were
by
this
time
assembled
,
according
to
annual
custom
on
Christmas
Eve
,
observed
by
old
Wardle
's
forefathers
from
time
immemorial
.
   
<EOS>
From
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
of
this
kitchen
,
old
Wardle
had
just
suspended
,
with
his
own
hands
,
a
huge
branch
of
mistletoe
,
and
this
same
branch
of
mistletoe
instantaneously
gave
rise
to
a
scene
of
general
and
most
delightful
struggling
and
confusion
;
in
the
midst
of
which
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
a
gallantry
that
would
have
done
honour
to
a
descendant
of
Lady
Tollimglower
herself
,
took
the
old
lady
by
the
hand
,
led
her
beneath
the
mystic
branch
,
and
saluted
her
in
all
courtesy
and
decorum
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
lady
submitted
to
this
piece
of
practical
politeness
with
all
the
dignity
which
befitted
so
important
and
serious
a
solemnity
,
but
the
younger
ladies
,
not
being
so
thoroughly
imbued
with
a
superstitious
veneration
for
the
custom
,
or
imagining
that
the
value
of
a
salute
is
very
much
enhanced
if
it
cost
a
little
trouble
to
obtain
it
,
screamed
and
struggled
,
and
ran
into
corners
,
and
threatened
and
remonstrated
,
and
did
everything
but
leave
the
room
,
until
some
of
the
less
adventurous
gentlemen
were
on
the
point
of
desisting
,
when
they
all
at
once
found
it
useless
to
resist
any
longer
,
and
submitted
to
be
kissed
with
a
good
grace
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
kissed
the
young
lady
with
the
black
eyes
,
and
Mr
Snodgrass
kissed
Emily
;
and
Mr
Weller
,
not
being
particular
about
the
form
of
being
under
the
mistletoe
,
kissed
Emma
and
the
other
female
servants
,
just
as
he
caught
them
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
poor
relations
,
they
kissed
everybody
,
not
even
excepting
the
plainer
portions
of
the
young
lady
visitors
,
who
,
in
their
excessive
confusion
,
ran
right
under
the
mistletoe
,
as
soon
as
it
was
hung
up
,
without
knowing
it
!
 
<EOS>
Wardle
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
surveying
the
whole
scene
,
with
the
utmost
satisfaction
;
and
the
fat
boy
took
the
opportunity
of
appropriating
to
his
own
use
,
and
summarily
devouring
,
a
particularly
fine
mince
-
pie
,
that
had
been
carefully
put
by
,
for
somebody
else
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
the
screaming
had
subsided
,
and
faces
were
in
a
glow
,
and
curls
in
a
tangle
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
,
after
kissing
the
old
lady
as
before
mentioned
,
was
standing
under
the
mistletoe
,
looking
with
a
very
pleased
countenance
on
all
that
was
passing
around
him
,
when
the
young
lady
with
the
black
eyes
,
after
a
little
whispering
with
the
other
young
ladies
,
made
a
sudden
dart
forward
,
and
,
putting
her
arm
round
Mr
Pickwick
's
neck
,
saluted
him
affectionately
on
the
left
cheek
;
and
before
Mr
Pickwick
distinctly
knew
what
was
the
matter
,
he
was
surrounded
by
the
whole
body
,
and
kissed
by
every
one
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
pleasant
thing
to
see
Mr
Pickwick
in
the
centre
of
the
group
,
now
pulled
this
way
,
and
then
that
,
and
first
kissed
on
the
chin
,
and
then
on
the
nose
,
and
then
on
the
spectacles
,
and
to
hear
the
peals
of
laughter
which
were
raised
on
every
side
;
but
it
was
a
still
more
pleasant
thing
to
see
Mr
Pickwick
,
blinded
shortly
afterwards
with
a
silk
handkerchief
,
falling
up
against
the
wall
,
and
scrambling
into
corners
,
and
going
through
all
the
mysteries
of
blind
-
man
's
buff
,
with
the
utmost
relish
for
the
game
,
until
at
last
he
caught
one
of
the
poor
relations
,
and
then
had
to
evade
the
blind
-
man
himself
,
which
he
did
with
a
nimbleness
and
agility
that
elicited
the
admiration
and
applause
of
all
beholders
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
relations
caught
the
people
who
they
thought
would
like
it
,
and
,
when
the
game
flagged
,
got
caught
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
all
tired
of
blind
-
man
's
buff
,
there
was
a
great
game
at
snap
-
dragon
,
and
when
fingers
enough
were
burned
with
that
,
and
all
the
raisins
were
gone
,
they
sat
down
by
the
huge
fire
of
blazing
logs
to
a
substantial
supper
,
and
a
mighty
bowl
of
wassail
,
something
smaller
than
an
ordinary
wash
-
house
copper
,
in
which
the
hot
apples
were
hissing
and
bubbling
with
a
rich
look
,
and
a
jolly
sound
,
that
were
perfectly
irresistible
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
round
him
,
"
this
is
,
indeed
,
comfort
.
"
<EOS>
"
Our
invariable
custom
,
"
replied
Mr
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Everybody
sits
down
with
us
on
Christmas
Eve
,
as
you
see
them
now
---
servants
and
all
;
and
here
we
wait
,
until
the
clock
strikes
twelve
,
to
usher
Christmas
in
,
and
beguile
the
time
with
forfeits
and
old
stories
.
<EOS>
Trundle
,
my
boy
,
rake
up
the
fire
.
"
   
<EOS>
Up
flew
the
bright
sparks
in
myriads
as
the
logs
were
stirred
.
<EOS>
The
deep
red
blaze
sent
forth
a
rich
glow
,
that
penetrated
into
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
,
and
cast
its
cheerful
tint
on
every
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
said
Wardle
,
"
a
song
---
a
Christmas
song
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
give
you
one
,
in
default
of
a
better
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Bravo
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fill
up

cried
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
two
hours
,
good
,
before

see
the
bottom
of
the
bowl
through
the
deep

colour
of
the
wassail
;
fill
up
all
round

and
now
for
the
song

"
   
<EOS>
Thus
saying
,
the
merry
old
gentleman
,
in
a
good
,
round
,
sturdy
voice
,
commenced
without
more
ado
---
   
<EOS>
A
CHRISTMAS
CAROL
   
<EOS>
"
I
care
not
for
Spring
;
on
his
fickle
wing
Let
the
blossoms
and
buds
be
borne
;
He
woos
them
amain
with
his
treacherous
rain
,
And
he
scatters
them
ere
the
morn
.
<EOS>
An
inconstant
elf
,
he
knows
not
himself
,
Nor
his
own
changing
mind
an
hour
,
He
'll
smile
in
your
face
,
and
,
with
wry
grimace
,
He
'll
wither
your
youngest
flower
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
the
Summer
sun
to
his
bright
home
run
,
He
shall
never
be
sought
by
me
;
When
he
's
dimmed
by
a
cloud
I
can
laugh
aloud
And
care
not
how
sulky
he
be
!
<EOS>
For
his
darling
child
is
the
madness
wild
That
sports
in
fierce
fever
's
train
;
And
when
love
is
too
strong
,
it
do
n't
last
long
,
As
many
have
found
to
their
pain
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
mild
harvest
night
,
by
the
tranquil
light
Of
the
modest
and
gentle
moon
,
Has
a
far
sweeter
sheen
for
me
,
<EOS>
I
ween
,
Than
the
broad
and
unblushing
noon
.
<EOS>
But
every
leaf
awakens
my
grief
,
As
it
lieth
beneath
the
tree
;
So
let
Autumn
air
be
never
so
fair
,
It
by
no
means
agrees
with
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
my
song
I
troll
out
,
for
CHRISTMAS
Stout
,
<EOS>
The
hearty
,
the
true
,
and
the
bold
;
<EOS>
A
bumper
I
drain
,
and
with
might
and
main
Give
three
cheers
for
this
Christmas
old
!
<EOS>
We
'll
usher
him
in
with
a
merry
din
That
shall
gladden
his
joyous
heart
,
And
we
'll
keep
him
up
,
while
there
's
bite
or
sup
,
And
in
fellowship
good
,
we
'll
part
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
his
fine
honest
pride
,
he
scorns
to
hide
One
jot
of
his
hard
-
weather
scars
;
They
're
no
disgrace
,
for
there
's
much
the
same
trace
<EOS>
On
the
cheeks
of
our
bravest
tars
.
<EOS>
Then
again
I
sing
till
the
roof
doth
ring
<EOS>
And
it
echoes
from
wall
to
wall
---
<EOS>
To
the
stout
old
wight
,
fair
welcome
to
-
night
,
As
the
King
of
the
Seasons
all
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
song
was
tumultuously
applauded
---
for
friends
and
dependents
<EOS>
make
a
capital
audience
---
and
the
poor
relations
,
especially
,
were
in
perfect
ecstasies
of
rapture
.
 
<EOS>
Again
was
the
fire
replenished
,
and
again
went
the
wassail
round
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
it
snows
!
"
said
one
of
the
men
,
in
a
low
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Snows
,
does
it
?
"
said
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rough
,
cold
night
,
Sir

"
replied
the
man
;
"
and
there
's
a
wind
got
up
,
that
drifts
it
across
the
fields
,
in
a
thick

the

There

anything
the

is
there

"
No

no

replied
Wardle
;
"
he
says
there
's
a
snowdrift

and
a
wind
that
's
piercing
cold

<EOS>
I
should
know
that
,
by
the
way
it
rumbles
in

<EOS>
"
Ah

"
said
the
old
lady
,
"
there
was
just
such
a
wind

just
such
a
fall

snow

a
good
many
years
back
,
I
recollect
---
just
five
years
before
your
poor
father
died

<EOS>
It
was
a
Christmas
Eve
,
too
;
and
I
remember
that
on
that
very
night
he
told
us
the
story
about
the
goblins
that
carried
away
old
Gabriel
Grub

<EOS>
"
The
story
about
what
?

said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
nothing

nothing
,
"
replied
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
About
an
old
sexton
,
that
the
good
people
down
here
suppose
to
have
been
carried
away
by
goblins
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Suppose
!

"
ejaculated
the
old
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anybody
hardy
enough
to
disbelieve
it
?
 
<EOS>
Suppose
!
 
<EOS>
Have
n't
you
heard
ever
since
you
were
a
child
,
that
he
WAS
carried
away
by
the
goblins

do
n't
you
know
he
was
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
mother
,
he
was
,
if
you
like

said
Wardle
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He

there

<EOS>

No

Mr

Wardle
smiled
,
as
every
head
was
bent
forward
to
hear
,
and
filling
out
the
wassail
with
no

nodded
a

began

Chapter

<EOS>
The
Story
of
the
Goblins
who
stole
a
Sexton
 
<EOS>
In
an
old
abbey
town
,
<EOS>
down
in
this
part
of
the
country
,
a
long
,
long
while
ago
---
so
long
,
that
the
story
must
be
a
true
one
,
because
our
great
-
grandfathers
implicitly
believed
it
---
there
officiated
as
sexton
and
grave
-
digger
in
the
churchyard
,
one
Gabriel
Grub
.
 
<EOS>
It
by
no
means
follows
that
because
a
man
is
a
sexton
,
and
constantly
surrounded
by
the
emblems
of
mortality
,
therefore
he
should
be
a
morose
and
melancholy
man
;
your
undertakers
are
the
merriest
fellows
in
the
world
;
and
I
once
had
the
honour
of
being
on
intimate
terms
with
a
mute
,
who
in
private
life
,
and
off
duty
,
was
as
comical
and
jocose
a
little
fellow
as
ever
chirped
out
a
devil
-
may
-
care
song
,
without
a
hitch
in
his
memory
,
or
drained
off
a
good
stiff
glass
without
stopping
for
breath
.
 
<EOS>
But
notwithstanding
these
precedents
to
the
contrary
,
Gabriel
Grub
was
an
ill
-
conditioned
,
cross
-
grained
,
surly
fellow
---
a
morose
and
lonely
man
,
who
consorted
with
nobody
but
himself
,
and
an
old
wicker
bottle
which
fitted
into
his
large
deep
waistcoat
pocket
---
and
who
eyed
each
merry
face
,
as
it
passed
him
by
,
with
such
a
deep
scowl
of
malice
and
ill
-
humour
,
as
it
was
difficult
to
meet
without
feeling
something
the
worse
for
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
little
before
twilight
,
one
Christmas
Eve
,
Gabriel
shouldered
his
spade
,
lighted
his
lantern
,
and
betook
himself
towards
the
old
churchyard
;
for
he
had
got
a
grave
to
finish
by
next
morning
,
and
,
feeling
very
low
,
he
thought
it
might
raise
his
spirits
,
perhaps
,
if
he
went
on
with
his
work
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
went
his
way
,
up
the
ancient
street
,
he
saw
the
cheerful
light
of
the
blazing
fires
gleam
through
the
old
casements
,
and
heard
the
loud
laugh
and
the
cheerful
shouts
of
those
who
were
assembled
around
them
;
he
marked
the
bustling
preparations
for
next
day
's
cheer
,
and
smelled
the
numerous
savoury
odours
consequent
thereupon
,
as
they
steamed
up
from
the
kitchen
windows
in
clouds
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
was
gall
and
wormwood
to
the
heart
of
Gabriel
Grub
;
and
when
groups
of
children
bounded
out
of
the
houses
,
tripped
across
the
road
,
and
were
met
,
before
they
could
knock
at
the
opposite
door
,
by
half
a
dozen
curly
-
headed
little
rascals
who
crowded
round
them
as
they
flocked
upstairs
to
spend
the
evening
in
their
Christmas
games
,
Gabriel
smiled
grimly
,
and
clutched
the
handle
of
his
spade
with
a
firmer
grasp
,
as
he
thought
of
measles
,
scarlet
fever
,
thrush
,
whooping
-
cough
,
and
a
good
many
other
sources
of
consolation
besides
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
this
happy
frame
of
mind
,
Gabriel
strode
along
,
returning
a
short
,
sullen
growl
to
the
good
-
humoured
greetings
of
such
of
his
neighbours
as
now
and
then
passed
him
,
until
he
turned
into
the
dark
lane
which
led
to
the
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Gabriel
had
been
looking
forward
to
reaching
the
dark
lane
,
because
it
was
,
generally
speaking
,
a
nice
,
gloomy
,
mournful
place
,
into
which
the
townspeople
did
not
much
care
to
go
,
except
in
broad
daylight
,
and
when
the
sun
was
shining
;
consequently
,
he
was
not
a
little
indignant
to
hear
a
young
urchin
roaring
out
some
jolly
song
about
a
merry
Christmas
,
in
this
very
sanctuary
which
had
been
called
Coffin
Lane
ever
since
the
days
of
the
old
abbey
,
and
the
time
of
the
shaven
-
headed
monks
.
 
<EOS>
As
Gabriel
walked
on
,
and
the
voice
drew
nearer
,
he
found
it
proceeded
from
a
small
boy
,
who
was
hurrying
along
,
to
join
one
of
the
little
parties
in
the
old
street
,
and
who
,
partly
to
keep
himself
company
,
and
partly
to
prepare
himself
for
the
occasion
,
was
shouting
out
the
song
at
the
highest
pitch
of
his
lungs
.
 
<EOS>
So
Gabriel
waited
until
the
boy
came
up
,
and
then
dodged
him
into
a
corner
,
and
rapped
him
over
the
head
with
his
lantern
five
or
six
times
,
just
to
teach
him
to
modulate
his
voice
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
the
boy
hurried
away
with
his
hand
to
his
head
,
singing
quite
a
different
sort
of
tune
,
Gabriel
Grub
chuckled
very
heartily
to
himself
,
and
entered
the
churchyard
,
locking
the
gate
behind
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
took
off
his
coat
,
set
down
his
lantern
,
and
getting
into
the
unfinished
grave
,
worked
at
it
for
an
hour
or
so
with
right
good
-
will
.
<EOS>
But
the
earth
was
hardened
with
the
frost
,
and
it
was
no
very
easy
matter
to
break
it
up
,
and
shovel
it
out
;
and
although
there
was
a
moon
,
it
was
a
very
young
one
,
and
shed
little
light
upon
the
grave
,
which
was
in
the
shadow
of
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
At
any
other
time
,
these
obstacles
would
have
made
Gabriel
Grub
very
moody
and
miserable
,
but
he
was
so
well
pleased
with
having
stopped
the
small
boy
's
singing
,
that
he
took
little
heed
of
the
scanty
progress
he
had
made
,
and
looked
down
into
the
grave
,
when
he
had
finished
work
for
the
night
,
with
grim
satisfaction
,
murmuring
as
he
gathered
up
his
things
---
     
<EOS>
Brave
lodgings
for
one
,
brave
lodgings
for
one
,
     
<EOS>
A
few
feet
of
cold
earth
,
when
life
is
done
;
     
A
stone
at
the
head
,
a
stone
at
the
feet
,
     
<EOS>
A
rich
,
juicy
meal
for
the
worms
to
eat
;
     
Rank
grass
overhead
,
and
damp
clay
around
,
     
Brave
lodgings
for
one
,
these
,
in
holy
ground
!
   
"
<EOS>
"
Ho
!
ho
!
<EOS>
"
laughed
Gabriel
Grub
,
as
he
sat
himself
down
on
a
flat
tombstone
which
was
a
favourite
resting
-
place
of
his
,
and
drew
forth
his
wicker
bottle
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
coffin
at
Christmas
!
 
<EOS>
A
Christmas
box
!
 
<EOS>
Ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
Ho
!
ho
!
ho
!
"
repeated
a
voice
which
sounded
close
behind
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gabriel
paused
,
in
some
alarm
,
in
the
act
of
raising
the
wicker
bottle
to
his
lips
,
and
looked
round
.
 
<EOS>
The
bottom
of
the
oldest
grave
about
him
was
not
more
still
and
quiet
than
the
churchyard
in
the
pale
moonlight
.
 
<EOS>
The
cold
hoar
frost
glistened
on
the
tombstones
,
and
sparkled
like
rows
of
gems
,
among
the
stone
carvings
of
the
old
church
.
 
<EOS>
The
snow
lay
hard
and
crisp
upon
the
ground
;
and
spread
over
the
thickly
-
strewn
mounds
of
earth
,
so
white
and
smooth
a
cover
that
it
seemed
as
if
corpses
lay
there
,
hidden
only
by
their
winding
sheets
.
 
<EOS>
Not
the
faintest
rustle
broke
the
profound
tranquillity
of
the
solemn
scene
.
 
<EOS>
Sound
itself
appeared
to
be
frozen
up
,
all
was
so
cold
and
still
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
It
was
the
echoes
,
"
said
Gabriel
Grub
,
raising
the
bottle
to
his
lips
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
It
was
NOT
,
"
said
a
deep
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gabriel
started
up
,
and
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
with
astonishment
and
terror
;
for
his
eyes
rested
on
a
form
that
made
his
blood
run
cold
.
   
<EOS>
"
Seated
on
an
upright
tombstone
,
close
to
him
,
was
a
strange
,
unearthly
figure
,
whom
Gabriel
felt
at
once
,
was
no
being
of
this
world
.
 
<EOS>
His
long
,
fantastic
legs
which
might
have
reached
the
ground
,
were
cocked
up
,
and
crossed
after
a
quaint
,
fantastic
fashion
;
his
sinewy
arms
were
bare
;
and
his
hands
rested
on
his
knees
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
short
,
round
body
,
he
wore
a
close
covering
,
ornamented
with
small
slashes
;
a
short
cloak
dangled
at
his
back
;
the
collar
was
cut
into
curious
peaks
,
which
served
the
goblin
in
lieu
of
ruff
or
neckerchief
;
and
his
shoes
curled
up
at
his
toes
into
long
points
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
head
,
he
wore
a
broad
-
brimmed
sugar
-
loaf
hat
,
garnished
with
a
single
feather
.
 
<EOS>
The
hat
was
covered
with
the
white
frost
;
and
the
goblin
looked
as
if
he
had
sat
on
the
same
tombstone
very
comfortably
,
for
two
or
three
hundred
years
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
perfectly
still
;
his
tongue
was
put
out
,
as
if
in
derision
;
and
he
was
grinning
at
Gabriel
Grub
with
such
a
grin
as
only
a
goblin
could
call
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
It
was
NOT
the
echoes
,
"
said
the
goblin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gabriel
Grub
was
paralysed
,
and
could
make
no
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
What
do
you
do
here
on
Christmas
Eve
?
"
said
the
goblin
sternly
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
came
to
dig
a
grave
,
Sir
,
"
stammered
Gabriel
Grub
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
What
man
wanders
among
graves
and
churchyards
on
such
a
night
as
this
?
"
cried
the
goblin
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Gabriel
Grub
!
 
<EOS>
Gabriel
Grub
!
"
screamed
a
wild
chorus
of
voices
that
seemed
to
fill
the
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
Gabriel
looked
fearfully
round
---
nothing
was
to
be
seen
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
What
have
you
got
in
that
bottle
?
"
said
the
goblin
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Hollands
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
sexton
,
trembling
more
than
ever
;
for
he
had
bought
it
of
the
smugglers
,
and
he
thought
that
perhaps
his
questioner
might
be
in
the
excise
department
of
the
goblins
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Who
drinks
Hollands
alone
,
and
in
a
churchyard
,
on
such
a
night
as
this
?
"
said
the
goblin
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Gabriel
Grub
!
 
<EOS>
Gabriel
Grub
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
wild
voices
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
goblin
leered
maliciously
at
the
terrified
sexton
,
and
then
raising
his
voice
,
exclaimed
---
   
"
"
And
who
,
then
,
is
our
fair
and
lawful
prize
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
To
this
inquiry
the
invisible
chorus
replied
,
in
a
strain
that
sounded
like
the
voices
of
many
choristers
singing
to
the
mighty
swell
of
the
old
church
organ
---
a
strain
that
seemed
borne
to
the
sexton
's
ears
upon
a
wild
wind
,
and
to
die
away
as
it
passed
onward
;
but
the
burden
of
the
reply
was
still
the
same
,
"
Gabriel
Grub
!
 
<EOS>
Gabriel
Grub
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
goblin
grinned
a
broader
grin
than
before
,
as
he
said
,
"
Well
,
Gabriel
,
what
do
you
say
to
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
sexton
gasped
for
breath
.
"
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
this
,
Gabriel
?
"
said
the
goblin
,
kicking
up
his
feet
in
the
air
on
either
side
of
the
tombstone
,
and
looking
at
the
turned
-
up
points
with
as
much
complacency
as
if
he
had
been
contemplating
the
most
fashionable
pair
of
Wellingtons
in
all
Bond
Street
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
It
's
---
<EOS>
it
's
---
very
curious
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
sexton
,
half
dead
with
fright
;
"
very
curious
,
and
very
pretty
,
<EOS>
but
I
think
I
'll
go
back
and
finish
my
work
,
Sir
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
"
Work
!
"
said
the
goblin
,
"
what
work
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
"
The
grave
,
Sir
;
making
the
grave
,
"
stammered
the
sexton
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Oh
,
the
grave
,
eh

"
said
the
goblin

who
makes
graves
at
a
time
when
all

men
are
merry

and
takes
a
pleasure
in
it

Again
the
mysterious
voices
replied
,
"
Gabriel
Grub
!
 
<EOS>
Gabriel
Grub
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
am
afraid
my
friends
want
you
,
Gabriel
,
"
said
the
goblin
,
thrusting
his
tongue
farther
into
his
cheek
than
ever
---
and
a
most
astonishing
tongue
it
was
<EOS>
---
"
I
'm
afraid
my
friends
want
you
,
Gabriel
,
"
said
the
goblin
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Under
favour
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
horror
-
stricken
sexton
,
"
I
do
n't
think
they
can
,
Sir
;
they
do
n't
know
me
,
Sir
;
I
do
n't
think
the
gentlemen
have
ever
seen
me
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
Oh
,
yes
,
they
have
,
"
replied
the
goblin
;
"
we
know
the
man
with
the
sulky
face
and
grim
scowl
,
that
came
down
the
street
to
-
night
,
throwing
his
evil
looks
at
the
children
,
and
grasping
his
burying
-
spade
the
tighter
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
the
man
who
struck
the
boy
in
the
envious
malice
of
his
heart
,
because
the
boy
could
be
merry
,
and
he
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
him
,
we
know
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
,
the
goblin
gave
a
loud
,
shrill
laugh
,
which
the
echoes
returned
twentyfold
;
and
throwing
his
legs
up
in
the
air
,
stood
upon
his
head
,
or
rather
upon
the
very
point
of
his
sugar
-
loaf
hat
,
on
the
narrow
edge
of
the
tombstone
,
whence
he
threw
a
Somerset
with
extraordinary
agility
,
right
to
the
sexton
's
feet
,
at
which
he
planted
himself
in
the
attitude
in
which
tailors
generally
sit
upon
the
shop
-
board
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
---
am
afraid
I
must
leave
you
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
sexton
,
making
an
effort
to
move
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Leave
us
!
"
said
the
goblin
,
"
Gabriel
Grub
going
to
leave
us
.
<EOS>
Ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
the
goblin
laughed
,
the
sexton
observed
,
for
one
instant
,
a
brilliant
illumination
within
the
windows
of
the
church
,
as
if
the
whole
building
were
lighted
up
;
it
disappeared
,
the
organ
pealed
forth
a
lively
air
,
and
whole
troops
of
goblins
,
the
very
counterpart
of
the
first
one
,
poured
into
the
churchyard
,
and
began
playing
at
leap
-
frog
with
the
tombstones
,
never
stopping
for
an
instant
to
take
breath
,
but
"
overing
"
the
highest
among
them
,
one
after
the
other
,
with
the
most
marvellous
dexterity
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
goblin
was
a
most
astonishing
leaper
,
and
none
of
the
others
could
come
near
him
;
even
in
the
extremity
of
his
terror
the
sexton
could
not
help
observing
,
that
while
his
friends
were
content
to
leap
over
the
common
-
sized
gravestones
,
the
first
one
took
the
family
vaults
,
iron
railings
and
all
,
with
as
much
ease
as
if
they
had
been
so
many
street
-
posts
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
last
the
game
reached
to
a
most
exciting
pitch
;
the
organ
played
quicker
and
quicker
,
and
the
goblins
leaped
faster
and
faster
,
coiling
themselves
up
,
rolling
head
over
heels
upon
the
ground
,
and
bounding
over
the
tombstones
like
footballs
.
 
<EOS>
The
sexton
's
brain
whirled
round
with
the
rapidity
of
the
motion
he
beheld
,
and
his
legs
reeled
beneath
him
,
as
the
spirits
flew
before
his
eyes
;
when
the
goblin
king
,
suddenly
darting
towards
him
,
laid
his
hand
upon
his
collar
,
and
sank
with
him
through
the
earth
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
Gabriel
Grub
had
had
time
to
fetch
his
breath
,
which
the
rapidity
of
his
descent
had
for
the
moment
taken
away
,
he
found
himself
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
large
cavern
,
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
crowds
of
goblins
,
ugly
and
grim
;
in
the
centre
of
the
room
,
on
an
elevated
seat
,
was
stationed
his
friend
of
the
churchyard
;
and
close
behind
him
stood
Gabriel
Grub
himself
,
without
power
of
motion
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Cold
to
-
night
,
"
said
the
king
of
the
goblins
,
"
very
cold
.
 
<EOS>
A
glass
of
something
warm
here
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
this
command
,
half
a
dozen
officious
goblins
,
with
a
perpetual
smile
upon
their
faces
,
whom
Gabriel
Grub
imagined
to
be
courtiers
,
on
that
account
,
hastily
disappeared
,
and
presently
returned
with
a
goblet
of
liquid
fire
,
which
they
presented
to
the
king
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Ah
!
"
cried
the
goblin
,
whose
cheeks
and
throat
were
transparent
,
as
he
tossed
down
the
flame
,
"
this
warms
one
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Bring
a
bumper
of
the
same
,
for
Mr
Grub
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
in
vain
for
the
unfortunate
sexton
to
protest
that
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
taking
anything
warm
at
night
;
one
of
the
goblins
held
him
while
another
poured
the
blazing
liquid
down
his
throat
;
the
whole
assembly
screeched
with
laughter
,
as
he
coughed
and
choked
,
and
wiped
away
the
tears
which
gushed
plentifully
from
his
eyes
,
after
swallowing
the
burning
draught
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
said
the
king
,
fantastically
poking
the
taper
corner
of
his
sugar
-
loaf
hat
into
the
sexton
's
eye
,
and
thereby
occasioning
him
the
most
exquisite
pain
;
"
and
now
,
show
the
man
of
misery
and
gloom
,
a
few
of
the
pictures
from
our
own
great
storehouse
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
the
goblin
said
this
,
a
thick
cloud
which
obscured
the
remoter
end
of
the
cavern
rolled
gradually
away
,
and
disclosed
,
apparently
at
a
great
distance
,
a
small
and
scantily
furnished
,
but
neat
and
clean
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
A
crowd
of
little
children
were
gathered
round
a
bright
fire
,
clinging
to
their
mother
's
gown
,
and
gambolling
around
her
chair
.
 
<EOS>
The
mother
occasionally
rose
,
and
drew
aside
the
window
-
curtain
,
as
if
to
look
for
some
expected
object
;
a
frugal
meal
was
ready
spread
upon
the
table
;
and
an
elbow
chair
was
placed
near
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
A
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
;
the
mother
opened
it
,
and
the
children
crowded
round
her
,
and
clapped
their
hands
for
joy
,
as
their
father
entered
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
wet
and
weary
,
and
shook
the
snow
from
his
garments
,
as
the
children
crowded
round
him
,
and
seizing
his
cloak
,
hat
,
stick
,
and
gloves
,
with
busy
zeal
,
ran
with
them
from
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
as
he
sat
down
to
his
meal
before
the
fire
,
the
children
climbed
about
his
knee
,
and
the
mother
sat
by
his
side
,
and
all
seemed
happiness
and
comfort
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
a
change
came
upon
the
view
,
almost
imperceptibly
.
 
<EOS>
The
scene
was
altered
to
a
small
bedroom
,
where
the
fairest
and
youngest
child
lay
dying
;
the
roses
had
fled
from
his
cheek
,
and
the
light
from
his
eye
;
and
even
as
the
sexton
looked
upon
him
with
an
interest
he
had
never
felt
or
known
before
,
he
died
.
 
<EOS>
His
young
brothers
and
sisters
crowded
round
his
little
bed
,
and
seized
his
tiny
hand
,
so
cold
and
heavy
;
but
they
shrank
back
from
its
touch
,
and
looked
with
awe
on
his
infant
face
;
for
calm
and
tranquil
as
it
was
,
and
sleeping
in
rest
and
peace
as
the
beautiful
child
seemed
to
be
,
they
saw
that
he
was
dead
,
and
they
knew
that
he
was
an
angel
looking
down
upon
,
and
blessing
them
,
from
a
bright
and
happy
Heaven
.
   
<EOS>
"
Again
the
light
cloud
passed
across
the
picture
,
and
again
the
subject
changed
.
 
<EOS>
The
father
and
mother
were
old
and
helpless
now
,
and
the
number
of
those
about
them
was
diminished
more
than
half
;
but
content
and
cheerfulness
sat
on
every
face
,
and
beamed
in
every
eye
,
as
they
crowded
round
the
fireside
,
and
told
and
listened
to
old
stories
of
earlier
and
bygone
days
.
 
<EOS>
Slowly
and
peacefully
,
the
father
sank
into
the
grave
,
and
,
soon
after
,
the
sharer
of
all
his
cares
and
troubles
followed
him
to
a
place
of
rest
.
 
<EOS>
The
few
who
yet
survived
them
,
kneeled
by
their
tomb
,
and
watered
the
green
turf
which
covered
it
with
their
tears
;
then
rose
,
and
turned
away
,
sadly
and
mournfully
,
but
not
with
bitter
cries
,
or
despairing
lamentations
,
for
they
knew
that
they
should
one
day
meet
again
;
and
once
more
they
mixed
with
the
busy
world
,
and
their
content
and
cheerfulness
were
restored
.
 
<EOS>
The
cloud
settled
upon
the
picture
,
and
concealed
it
from
the
sexton
's
view
.
   
"
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
THAT
?
"
said
the
goblin
,
turning
his
large
face
towards
Gabriel
Grub
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Gabriel
murmured
out
something
about
its
being
very
pretty
,
and
looked
somewhat
ashamed
,
as
the
goblin
bent
his
fiery
eyes
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
You
miserable
man
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
goblin
,
in
a
tone
of
excessive
contempt
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
!
"
<EOS>
He
appeared
disposed
to
add
more
,
but
indignation
choked
his
utterance
,
so
he
lifted
up
one
of
his
very
pliable
legs
,
and
,
flourishing
it
above
his
head
a
little
,
to
insure
his
aim
,
administered
a
good
sound
kick
to
Gabriel
Grub
;
immediately
after
which
,
all
the
goblins
in
waiting
crowded
round
the
wretched
sexton
,
and
kicked
him
without
mercy
,
according
to
the
established
and
invariable
custom
of
courtiers
upon
earth
,
who
kick
whom
royalty
kicks
,
and
hug
whom
royalty
hugs
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Show
him
some
more
!
"
said
the
king
of
the
goblins
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
these
words
,
the
cloud
was
dispelled
,
and
a
rich
and
beautiful
landscape
was
disclosed
to
view
---
there
is
just
such
another
,
to
this
day
,
within
half
a
mile
of
the
old
abbey
town
.
<EOS>
The
sun
shone
from
out
the
clear
blue
sky
,
the
water
sparkled
beneath
his
rays
,
and
the
trees
looked
greener
,
and
the
flowers
more
gay
,
beneath
its
cheering
influence
.
 
<EOS>
The
water
rippled
on
with
a
pleasant
sound
,
the
trees
rustled
in
the
light
wind
that
murmured
among
their
leaves
,
the
birds
sang
upon
the
boughs
,
and
the
lark
carolled
on
high
her
welcome
to
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
it
was
morning
;
the
bright
,
balmy
morning
of
summer
;
the
minutest
leaf
,
the
smallest
blade
of
grass
,
was
instinct
with
life
.
<EOS>
The
ant
crept
forth
to
her
daily
toil
,
the
butterfly
fluttered
and
basked
in
the
warm
rays
of
the
sun
;
myriads
of
insects
spread
their
transparent
wings
,
and
revelled
in
their
brief
but
happy
existence
.
 
<EOS>
Man
walked
forth
,
elated
with
the
scene
;
and
all
was
brightness
and
splendour
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
YOU
a
miserable
man
!
"
said
the
king
of
the
goblins
,
in
a
more
contemptuous
tone
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
And
again
the
king
of
the
goblins
gave
his
leg
a
flourish
;
again
it
descended
on
the
shoulders
of
the
sexton
;
and
again
the
attendant
goblins
imitated
the
example
of
their
chief
.
   
<EOS>
"
Many
a
time
the
cloud
went
and
came
,
and
many
a
lesson
it
taught
to
Gabriel
Grub
,
who
,
although
his
shoulders
smarted
with
pain
from
the
frequent
applications
of
the
goblins
"
feet
thereunto
,
looked
on
with
an
interest
that
nothing
could
diminish
.
<EOS>
He
saw
that
men
who
worked
hard
,
and
earned
their
scanty
bread
with
lives
of
labour
,
were
cheerful
and
happy
;
and
that
to
the
most
ignorant
,
the
sweet
face
of
Nature
was
a
never
-
failing
source
of
cheerfulness
and
joy
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
those
who
had
been
delicately
nurtured
,
and
tenderly
brought
up
,
cheerful
under
privations
,
and
superior
to
suffering
,
that
would
have
crushed
many
of
a
rougher
grain
,
because
they
bore
within
their
own
bosoms
the
materials
of
happiness
,
contentment
,
and
peace
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
that
women
,
the
tenderest
and
most
fragile
of
all
God
's
creatures
,
were
the
oftenest
superior
to
sorrow
,
adversity
,
and
distress
;
and
he
saw
that
it
was
because
they
bore
,
in
their
own
hearts
,
an
inexhaustible
well
-
spring
of
affection
and
devotion
.
<EOS>
Above
all
,
he
saw
that
men
like
himself
,
who
snarled
at
the
mirth
and
cheerfulness
of
others
,
were
the
foulest
weeds
on
the
fair
surface
of
the
earth
;
and
setting
all
the
good
of
the
world
against
the
evil
,
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
a
very
decent
and
respectable
sort
of
world
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
he
formed
it
,
than
the
cloud
which
had
closed
over
the
last
picture
,
seemed
to
settle
on
his
senses
,
and
lull
him
to
repose
.
 
<EOS>
One
by
one
,
the
goblins
faded
from
his
sight
;
and
,
as
the
last
one
disappeared
,
he
sank
to
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
day
had
broken
when
Gabriel
Grub
awoke
,
and
found
himself
lying
at
full
length
on
the
flat
gravestone
in
the
churchyard
,
with
the
wicker
bottle
lying
empty
by
his
side
,
and
his
coat
,
spade
,
and
lantern
,
all
well
whitened
by
the
last
night
's
frost
,
scattered
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
The
stone
on
which
he
had
first
seen
the
goblin
seated
,
stood
bolt
upright
before
him
,
and
the
grave
at
which
he
had
worked
,
the
night
before
,
was
not
far
off
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
he
began
to
doubt
the
reality
of
his
adventures
,
but
the
acute
pain
in
his
shoulders
when
he
attempted
to
rise
,
assured
him
that
the
kicking
of
the
goblins
was
certainly
not
ideal
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
staggered
again
,
by
observing
no
traces
of
footsteps
in
the
snow
on
which
the
goblins
had
played
at
leap
-
frog
with
the
gravestones
,
but
he
speedily
accounted
for
this
circumstance
when
he
remembered
that
,
being
spirits
,
they
would
leave
no
visible
impression
behind
them
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
Gabriel
Grub
got
on
his
feet
as
well
as
he
could
,
for
the
pain
in
his
back
;
and
,
brushing
the
frost
off
his
coat
,
put
it
on
,
and
turned
his
face
towards
the
town
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
he
was
an
altered
man
,
and
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
returning
to
a
place
where
his
repentance
would
be
scoffed
at
,
and
his
reformation
disbelieved
.
 
<EOS>
He
hesitated
for
a
few
moments
;
and
then
turned
away
to
wander
where
he
might
,
and
seek
his
bread
elsewhere
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
lantern
,
the
spade
,
and
the
wicker
bottle
were
found
,
that
day
,
in
the
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
a
great
many
speculations
about
the
sexton
's
fate
,
at
first
,
but
it
was
speedily
determined
that
he
had
been
carried
away
by
the
goblins
;
and
there
were
not
wanting
some
very
credible
witnesses
who
had
distinctly
seen
him
whisked
through
the
air
on
the
back
of
a
chestnut
horse
blind
of
one
eye
,
with
the
hind
-
quarters
of
a
lion
,
and
the
tail
of
a
bear
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
all
this
was
devoutly
believed
;
and
the
new
sexton
used
to
exhibit
to
the
curious
,
for
a
trifling
emolument
,
a
good
-
sized
piece
of
the
church
weathercock
which
had
been
accidentally
kicked
off
by
the
aforesaid
horse
in
his
aerial
flight
,
and
picked
up
by
himself
in
the
churchyard
,
a
year
or
two
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
"
Unfortunately
,
these
stories
were
somewhat
disturbed
by
the
unlooked
-
for
reappearance
of
Gabriel
Grub
himself
,
some
ten
years
afterwards
,
a
ragged
,
contented
,
rheumatic
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
his
story
to
the
clergyman
,
and
also
to
the
mayor
;
and
in
course
of
time
it
began
to
be
received
as
a
matter
of
history
,
in
which
form
it
has
continued
down
to
this
very
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
believers
in
the
weathercock
tale
,
having
misplaced
their
confidence
once
,
were
not
easily
prevailed
upon
to
part
with
it
again
,
so
they
looked
as
wise
as
they
could
,
shrugged
their
shoulders
,
touched
their
foreheads
,
and
murmured
something
about
Gabriel
Grub
having
drunk
all
the
Hollands
,
and
then
fallen
asleep
on
the
flat
tombstone
;
and
they
affected
to
explain
what
he
supposed
he
had
witnessed
in
the
goblin
's
cavern
,
by
saying
that
he
had
seen
the
world
,
and
grown
wiser
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
opinion
,
which
was
by
no
means
a
popular
one
at
any
time
,
gradually
died
off
;
and
be
the
matter
how
it
may
,
as
Gabriel
Grub
was
afflicted
with
rheumatism
to
the
end
of
his
days
,
this
story
has
at
least
one
moral
,
if
it
teach
no
better
one
---
and
that
is
,
that
if
a
man
turn
sulky
and
drink
by
himself
at
Christmas
time
,
he
may
make
up
his
mind
to
be
not
a
bit
the
better
for
it
:
let
the
spirits
be
never
so
good
,
or
let
them
be
even
as
many
degrees
beyond
proof
,
as
those
which
Gabriel
Grub
saw
in
the
goblin
's
cavern
.

This
gentleman
is
his
very
particular
friend
,
Mr
---
"
   
"
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
"
interposed
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
;
whereupon
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
and
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
laughed
in
concert
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
bowed
to
Bob
Sawyer
,
and
Bob
Sawyer
bowed
to
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
Bob
and
his
very
particular
friend
then
applied
themselves
most
assiduously
to
the
eatables
before
them
;
and
Mr
Pickwick
had
an
opportunity
of
glancing
at
them
both
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
was
a
coarse
,
stout
,
thick
-
set
young
man
,
with
black
hair
cut
rather
short
,
and
a
white
face
cut
rather
long
.
<EOS>
He
was
embellished
with
spectacles
,
and
wore
a
white
neckerchief
.
<EOS>
Below
his
single
-
breasted
black
surtout
,
which
was
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
,
appeared
the
usual
number
of
pepper
-
and
-
salt
coloured
legs
,
terminating
in
a
pair
of
imperfectly
polished
boots
.
 
<EOS>
Although
his
coat
was
short
in
the
sleeves
,
it
disclosed
no
vestige
of
a
linen
wristband
;
and
although
there
was
quite
enough
of
his
face
to
admit
of
the
encroachment
of
a
shirt
collar
,
it
was
not
graced
by
the
smallest
approach
to
that
appendage
.
<EOS>
He
presented
,
altogether
,
rather
a
mildewy
appearance
,
and
emitted
a
fragrant
odour
of
full
-
flavoured
Cubas
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
who
was
habited
in
a
coarse
,
blue
coat
,
which
,
without
being
either
a
greatcoat
or
a
surtout
,
partook
of
the
nature
and
qualities
of
both
,
had
about
him
that
sort
of
slovenly
smartness
,
and
swaggering
gait
,
which
is
peculiar
to
young
gentlemen
who
smoke
in
the
streets
by
day
,
shout
and
scream
in
the
same
by
night
,
call
waiters
by
their
Christian
names
,
and
do
various
other
acts
and
deeds
of
an
equally
facetious
description
.
 
<EOS>
He
wore
a
pair
of
plaid
trousers
,
and
a
large
,
rough
,
double
-
breasted
waistcoat
;
out
of
doors
,
he
carried
a
thick
stick
with
a
big
top
.
 
<EOS>
He
eschewed
gloves
,
and
looked
,
upon
the
whole
,
something
like
a
dissipated
Robinson
Crusoe
.
   
<EOS>
Such
were
the
two
worthies
to
whom
Mr
Pickwick
was
introduced
,
as
he
took
his
seat
at
the
breakfast
-
table
on
Christmas
morning
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Splendid
morning
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
slightly
nodded
his
assent
to
the
proposition
,
and
asked
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
for
the
mustard
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
come
far
this
morning
,
gentlemen
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Blue
Lion

Muggleton

briefly
responded
Mr
Allen
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
joined
us
last
night
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
we
should
,
"
replied
Bob
Sawyer
,
"
but
the
brandy
was
too
good
to
leave
in
a
hurry
;
was
n't
it
,
Ben
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
;
"
and
the
cigars
were
not
bad
,
or
the
pork
-
chops
either
;
were
they
,
Bob
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Decidedly
not
,
"
said
Bob
.
 
<EOS>
The
particular
friends
resumed
their
attack
upon
the
breakfast
,
more
freely
than
before
,
as
if
the
recollection
of
last
night
's
supper
had
imparted
a
new
relish
to
the
meal
.
   
<EOS>
"
Peg
away
,
Bob
,
"
said
Mr
Allen
,
to
his
companion
,
encouragingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
do
,
"
replied
Bob
Sawyer
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
to
do
him
justice
,
he
did
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
like
dissecting
,
to
give
one
an
appetite
,
"
said
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
looking
round
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
slightly
shuddered
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
the
bye
,
Bob
,
"
said
Mr
Allen
,
"
have
you
finished
that
leg
yet
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nearly
,
"
replied
Sawyer
,
helping
himself
to
half
a
fowl
as
he
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
very
muscular
one
for
a
child
's
.
"
<EOS>
"
Is
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Allen
carelessly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very

"
said
Bob
Sawyer
,
with
his
mouth
full
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
put
my
name
down
for
an
arm
at
our
place
,
"
said
Mr
Allen
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
're
clubbing
for
a
subject
,
and
the
list
is
nearly
full
,
only
we
ca
n't
get
hold
of
any
fellow
that
wants
a

.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
'd
take

.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No

"
replied
"
Bob
Sawyer
;
"
ca

expensive
luxuries
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense

"
said
Allen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't

indeed
,
"
rejoined
Bob
Sawyer
,
"
I
would
n't
mind
a
brain
,
but
I
could
n't
stand
a
whole
head
.
"
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
hush
,
gentlemen
,
pray
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
I
hear
the
ladies
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Pickwick
spoke
,
the
ladies
,
gallantly
escorted
by
Messrs.
Snodgrass
,
Winkle
,
and
Tupman
,
returned
from
an
early
walk
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Ben
!
"
said
Arabella
,
in
a
tone
which
expressed
more
surprise
than
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
her
brother
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
to
take
you
home
to
-
morrow
,
"
replied
Benjamin
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
turned
pale
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
see
Bob
Sawyer
,
Arabella
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
,
somewhat
reproachfully
.
 
<EOS>
Arabella
gracefully
held
out
her
hand
,
in
acknowledgment
of
Bob
Sawyer
's
presence
.
 
<EOS>
A
thrill
of
hatred
struck
to
Mr
Winkle
's
heart
,
as
Bob
Sawyer
inflicted
on
the
proffered
hand
a
perceptible
squeeze
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ben
,
dear
!
"
said
Arabella
,
blushing
;
"
have
---
have
---
you
been
introduced
to
Mr
Winkle
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
been
,
but
I
shall
be
very
happy
to
be
,
Arabella
,
"
replied
her
brother
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Allen
bowed
grimly
to
Mr
Winkle
,
while
Mr
Winkle
and
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
glanced
mutual
distrust
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
The
arrival
of
the
two
new
visitors
,
and
the
consequent
check
upon
Mr
Winkle
and
the
young
lady
with
the
fur
round
her
boots
,
would
in
all
probability
have
proved
a
very
unpleasant
interruption
to
the
hilarity
of
the
party
,
had
not
the
cheerfulness
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
the
good
humour
of
the
host
,
been
exerted
to
the
very
utmost
for
the
common
weal
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
gradually
insinuated
himself
into
the
good
graces
of
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
,
and
even
joined
in
a
friendly
conversation
with
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
;
who
,
enlivened
with
the
brandy
,
and
the
breakfast
,
and
the
talking
,
gradually
ripened
into
a
state
of
extreme
facetiousness
,
and
related
with
much
glee
an
agreeable
anecdote
,
about
the
removal
of
a
tumour
on
some
gentleman
's
head
,
which
he
illustrated
by
means
of
an
oyster
-
knife
and
a
half
-
quartern
loaf
,
to
the
great
edification
of
the
assembled
company
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
whole
train
went
to
church
,
where
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
fell
fast
asleep
;
while
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
abstracted
his
thoughts
from

"

said
Wardle
,
after
a
substantial
lunch
,
with
the
agreeable
items
of
strong
beer
and
cherry

brandy

had
been
done
ample
justice

We

Mr

<EOS>
"
Prime

<EOS>
ejaculated
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
skate

Winkle

"
said
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ye
<EOS>
-
yes
;
oh

yes

"
replied
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
---
I

am
RATHER
out
of

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
DO
skate

Mr
Winkle

"
said
Arabella
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
like
to
see
it
so
much

"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
is
SO
graceful
,
"
said
another
young
lady
.
<EOS>
A
third
young
lady
said
it
was
elegant
,
and
a
fourth
expressed
her
opinion
that
it
was
"
swan
-
like
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
happy
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
reddening
;
"
but
I
have
no
skates
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
This
objection
was
at
once
overruled
.
 
<EOS>
Trundle
had
a
couple
of
pair
,
and
the
fat
boy
announced
that
there
were
half
a
dozen
more
downstairs
;
whereat
Mr
Winkle
expressed
exquisite
delight
,
and
looked
exquisitely
uncomfortable
.
   
<EOS>
Old
Wardle
led
the
way
to
a
pretty
large
sheet
of
ice
;
and
the
fat
boy
and
Mr
Weller
,
having
shovelled
and
swept
away
the
snow
which
had
fallen
on
it
during
the
night
,
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
adjusted
his
skates
with
a
dexterity
which
to
Mr
Winkle
was
perfectly
marvellous
,
and
described
circles
with
his
left
leg
,
and
cut
figures
of
eight
,
and
inscribed
upon
the
ice
,
without
once
stopping
for
breath
,
a
great
many
other
pleasant
and
astonishing
devices
,
to
the
excessive
satisfaction
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
Mr
Tupman
,
and
the
ladies
;
which
reached
a
pitch
of
positive
enthusiasm
,
when
old
Wardle
and
Benjamin
Allen
,
assisted
by
the
aforesaid
Bob
Sawyer
,
performed
some
mystic
evolutions
,
which
they
called
a
reel
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
Mr
Winkle
,
with
his
face
and
hands
blue
with
the
cold
,
had
been
forcing
a
gimlet
into
the
sole
of
his
feet
,
and
putting
his
skates
on
,
with
the
points
behind
,
and
getting
the
straps
into
a
very
complicated
and
entangled
state
,
with
the
assistance
of
Mr
Snodgrass
,
who
knew
rather
less
about
skates
than
a
Hindoo
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
with
the
assistance
of
Mr
Weller
,
the
unfortunate
skates
were
firmly
screwed
and
buckled
on
,
and
Mr
Winkle
was
raised
to
his
feet
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
then
,
Sir
,
"
said
Sam
,
in
an
encouraging
tone
;
<EOS>
"
off
vith
you
,
and
show
'em
how
to
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
,
Sam
,
stop
!
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
trembling
violently
,
and
clutching
hold
of
Sam
's
arms
with
the
grasp
of
a
drowning
man
.
<EOS>
"
How
slippery
it
is
,
Sam
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
an
uncommon
thing
upon
ice
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
<EOS>
"
Hold
up
,
Sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
last
observation
of
Mr
Weller
's
bore
reference
to
a
demonstration
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
made
at
the
instant
,
of
a
frantic
desire
to
throw
his
feet
in
the
air
,
and
dash
the
back
of
his
head
on
the
ice
.
   
<EOS>
"
These
---
these
---
are
very
awkward
skates

ai
n't
they

Sam

"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Winkle
,
staggering
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afeerd
there
's
a
orkard
gen'l'm'n

replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Winkle
,
"
cried
Mr
Pickwick
,
quite
unconscious
that
there
was
anything
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
;
the
ladies
are
all
anxiety

"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes

yes

"
replied
Mr
Winkle
,
with
a
ghastly
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
a

said
Sam

endeavouring
to
disengage
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Sir
,
start
off
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
an
instant
,
Sam
,
"
gasped
Mr
Winkle
,
clinging
most
affectionately
to
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
find
I
've
got
a
couple

You

<EOS>
"
Thank'ee

replied
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never

said
Mr
Winkle
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
take
your
hand
away
to
do
that

<EOS>
I
meant
to
have
given

for

Sam

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You

"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Just
hold
me
at
first
,
Sam
;
will
you
?
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
There

that
's
right

<EOS>
I
shall
soon
get
in
the
way

Sam

<EOS>
Not
too
fast
,
Sam
;
not
too
fast
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
,
stooping
forward
,
with
his
body
half
doubled
up
,
was
being
assisted
over
the
ice
by
Mr
Weller
,
in
a
very
singular
and
un
-
swan
-
like
manner
,
when
Mr
Pickwick
most
innocently
shouted
from
the
opposite
bank
---
   
"
Sam
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
go
,
Sir

"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
hear
the
governor
a

callin
'
?
<EOS>
Let
go
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
a
violent
effort
,
Mr
Weller
disengaged
himself
from
the
grasp
of
the
agonised
Pickwickian
,
and
,
in
so
doing
,
administered
a
considerable
impetus
to
the
unhappy
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
With
an
accuracy
which
no
degree
of
dexterity
or
practice
could
have
insured
,
that
unfortunate
gentleman
bore
swiftly
down
into
the
centre
of
the
reel
,
at
the
very
moment
when
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
was
performing
a
flourish
of
unparalleled
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
struck
wildly
against
him
,
and
with
a
loud
crash
they
both
fell
heavily
down
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
ran
to
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
Bob
Sawyer
had
risen
to
his
feet
,
but
Mr
Winkle
was
far
too
wise
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
,
in
skates
.
<EOS>
He
was
seated
on
the
ice
,
making
spasmodic
efforts
to
smile
;
but
anguish
was
depicted
on
every
lineament
of
his
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
hurt
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
,
with
great
anxiety
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
much
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
rubbing
his
back
very
hard
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
'd
let
me
bleed
you
,
"
said
Mr
Benjamin
,
with
great
eagerness
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
hurriedly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
you
had
better
,
"
said
Allen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
;
"
I
'd
rather
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
YOU
think
,
Mr
Pickwick
?
"
inquired
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
excited
and
indignant
.
 
<EOS>
He
beckoned
to
Mr
Weller
,
and
said
in
a
stern
voice
,
"
Take
his
skates
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
;
but
really
I
had
scarcely
begun
,
"
remonstrated
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
his
skates
off
,
"
repeated
Mr
Pickwick
firmly
.
   
<EOS>
The
command
was
not
to
be
resisted
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
allowed
Sam
to
obey
it
,
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lift
him
up
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
assisted
him
to
rise
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
retired
a
few
paces
apart
from
the
bystanders
;
and
,
beckoning
his
friend
to
approach
,
fixed
a
searching
look
upon
him
,
and
uttered
in
a
low
,
but
distinct
and
emphatic
tone
,
these
remarkable
words
---
   
"
You
're
a
humbug
,
sir
.
"
<EOS>
"
A
what
?
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
starting
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
humbug
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
speak
plainer
,
if
you
wish
it
.
 
<EOS>
An
impostor
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
those
words
,
Mr
Pickwick
turned
slowly
on
his
heel
,
and
rejoined
his
friends
.
   
<EOS>
While
Mr
Pickwick
was
delivering
himself
of
the
sentiment
just
recorded
,
Mr
Weller
and
the
fat
boy
,
having
by
their
joint
endeavours
cut
out
a
slide
,
were
exercising
themselves
thereupon
,
in
a
very
masterly
and
brilliant
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
Weller
,
in
particular
,
was
displaying
that
beautiful
feat
of
fancy
-
sliding
which
is
currently
denominated
"
knocking
at
the
cobbler
's
door
,
"
and
which
is
achieved
by
skimming
over
the
ice
on
one
foot
,
and
occasionally
giving
a
postman
's
knock
upon
it
with
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
good
long
slide
,
and
there
was
something
in
the
motion
which
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
was
very
cold
with
standing
still
,
could
not
help
envying
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
looks
a
nice
warm
exercise
that
,
does
n't
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
of
Wardle
,
when
that
gentleman
was
thoroughly
out
of
breath
,
by
reason
of
the
indefatigable
manner
in
which
he
had
converted
his
legs
into
a
pair
of
compasses
,
and
drawn
complicated
problems
on
the
ice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
it
does
,
indeed
,
"
replied
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
slide
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
used
to
do
so
,
on
the
gutters
,
when
I
was
a
boy
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Try
it
now
,
"
said
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
,
please
,
Mr
Pickwick
!
"
cried
all
the
ladies
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
happy
to
afford
you
any
amusement
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
but
I
have
n't
done
such
a
thing
these
thirty
years
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
<EOS>
pooh
!
 
<EOS>
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
"
said
Wardle
,
dragging
off
his
skates
with
the
impetuosity
which
characterised
all
his
proceedings
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
;
I
'll
keep
you
company
;
come
along
!
"
<EOS>
And
away
went
the
good
-
tempered
old
fellow
down
the
slide
,
with
a
rapidity
which
came
very
close
upon
Mr
Weller
,
and
beat
the
fat
boy
all
to
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
paused
,
considered
,
pulled
off
his
gloves
and
put
them
in
his
hat
;
took
two
or
three
short
runs
,
baulked
himself
as
often
,
and
at
last
took
another
run
,
and
went
slowly
and
gravely
down
the
slide
,
with
his
feet
about
a
yard
and
a
quarter
apart
,
amidst
the
gratified
shouts
of
all
the
spectators
.
   
<EOS>
"
Keep
the
pot
a
-
bilin
'
,
Sir
!
"
said
Sam
;
and
down
went
Wardle
again
,
and
then
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
then
Sam
,
and
then
Mr
Winkle
,
and
then
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
and
then
the
fat
boy
,
and
then
Mr
Snodgrass
,
following
closely
upon
each
other
's
heels
,
and
running
after
each
other
with
as
much
eagerness
as
if
their
future
prospects
in
life
depended
on
their
expedition
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
most
intensely
interesting
thing
,
to
observe
the
manner
in
which
Mr
Pickwick
performed
his
share
in
the
ceremony
;
to
watch
the
torture
of
anxiety
with
which
he
viewed
the
person
behind
,
gaining
upon
him
at
the
imminent
hazard
of
tripping
him
up
;
to
see
him
gradually
expend
the
painful
force
he
had
put
on
at
first
,
and
turn
slowly
round
on
the
slide
,
with
his
face
towards
the
point
from
which
he
had
started
;
to
contemplate
the
playful
smile
which
mantled
on
his
face
when
he
had
accomplished
the
distance
,
and
the
eagerness
with
which
he
turned
round
when
he
had
done
so
,
and
ran
after
his
predecessor
,
his
black
gaiters
tripping
pleasantly
through
the
snow
,
and
his
eyes
beaming
cheerfulness
and
gladness
through
his
spectacles
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
he
was
knocked
down
(
which
happened
upon
the
average
every
third
round
)
,
it
was
the
most
invigorating
sight
that
can
possibly
be
imagined
,
to
behold
him
gather
up
his
hat
,
gloves
,
and
handkerchief
,
with
a
glowing
countenance
,
and
resume
his
station
in
the
rank
,
with
an
ardour
and
enthusiasm
that
nothing
Could
abate
.
   
<EOS>
The
sport
was
at
its
height
,
the
sliding
was
at
the
quickest
,
the
laughter
was
at
the
loudest
,
when
a
sharp
smart
crack
was
heard
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
quick
rush
towards
the
bank
,
a
wild
scream
from
the
ladies
,
and
a
shout
from
Mr
Tupman
.
 
<EOS>
A
large
mass
of
ice
disappeared
;
the
water
bubbled
up
over
it
;
Mr
Pickwick
's
hat
,
gloves
,
and
handkerchief
were
floating
on
the
surface
;
and
this
was
all
of
Mr
Pickwick
that
anybody
could
see
.
   
<EOS>
Dismay
and
anguish
were
depicted
on
every
countenance
;
the
males
turned
pale
,
and
the
females
fainted
;
Mr
Snodgrass
and
Mr
Winkle
grasped
each
other
by
the
hand
,
and
gazed
at
the
spot
where
their
leader
had
gone
down
,
with
frenzied
eagerness
;
while
Mr
Tupman
,
by
way
of
rendering
the
promptest
assistance
,
and
at
the
same
time
conveying
to
any
persons
who
might
be
within
hearing
,
the
clearest
possible
notion
of
the
catastrophe
,
ran
off
across
the
country
at
his
utmost
speed
,
screaming
"
Fire
!
"
<EOS>
with
all
his
might
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
at
this
moment
,
when
old
Wardle
and
Sam
Weller
were
approaching
the
hole
with
cautious
steps
,
and
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
was
holding
a
hurried
consultation
with
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
on
the
advisability
of
bleeding
the
company
generally
,
as
an
improving
little
bit
of
professional
practice
<EOS>
---
it
was
at
this
very
moment
,
that
a
face
,
head
,
and
shoulders
,
emerged
from
beneath
the
water
,
and
disclosed
the
features
and
spectacles
of
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Keep
yourself
up
for
an
instant
---
for
only
one
instant
!
"
<EOS>
bawled
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
do
;
let
me
implore
you
---
for
my
sake
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Mr
Winkle
,
deeply
affected
.
 
<EOS>
The
adjuration
was
rather
unnecessary
;
the
probability
being
,
that
if
Mr
Pickwick
had
declined
to
keep
himself
up
for
anybody
else
's
sake
,
it
would
have
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
as
well
do
so
,
for
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
feel
the
bottom
there
,
old
fellow
?
"
said
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
certainly
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
wringing
the
water
from
his
head
and
face
,
and
gasping
for
breath
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
fell
upon
my
back
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
get
on
my
feet
at
first
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
clay
upon
so
much
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
coat
as
was
yet
visible
,
bore
testimony
to
the
accuracy
of
this
statement
;
and
as
the
fears
of
the
spectators
were
still
further
relieved
by
the
fat
boy
's
suddenly
recollecting
that
the
water
was
nowhere
more
than
five
feet
deep
,
prodigies
of
valour
were
performed
to
get
him
out
.
<EOS>
After
a
vast
quantity
of
splashing
,
and
cracking
,
and
struggling
,
Mr
Pickwick
was
at
length
fairly
extricated
from
his
unpleasant
position
,
and
once
more
stood
on
dry
land
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
he
'll
catch
his
death
of
cold
,
"
said
Emily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
old
thing
!
"
said
Arabella
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
wrap
this
shawl
round
you
,
Mr
Pickwick
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
that
's
the
best
thing
you
can
do
,
"
said
Wardle
;
"
<EOS>
and
when
you
've
got
it
on
,
run
home
as
fast
as
your
legs
can
carry
you
,
and
jump
into
bed
directly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
dozen
shawls
were
offered
on
the
instant
.
 
<EOS>
Three
or
four
of
the
thickest
having
been
selected
,
Mr
Pickwick
was
wrapped
up
,
and
started
off
,
under
the
guidance
of
Mr
Weller
;
presenting
the
singular
phenomenon
of
an
elderly
gentleman
,
dripping
wet
,
and
without
a
hat
,
with
his
arms
bound
down
to
his
sides
,
skimming
over
the
ground
,
without
any
clearly
-
defined
purpose
,
at
the
rate
of
six
good
English
miles
an
hour
.
   
<EOS>
But
Mr
Pickwick
cared
not
for
appearances
in
such
an
extreme
case
,
and
urged
on
by
Sam
Weller
,
he
kept
at
the
very
top
of
his
speed
until
he
reached
the
door
of
Manor
Farm
,
where
Mr
Tupman
had
arrived
some
five
minutes
before
,
and
had
frightened
the
old
lady
into
palpitations
of
the
heart
by
impressing
her
with
the
unalterable
conviction
that
the
kitchen
chimney
was
on
fire
---
a
calamity
which
always
presented
itself
in
glowing
colours
to
the
old
lady
's
mind
,
when
anybody
about
her
evinced
the
smallest
agitation
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
paused
not
an
instant
until
he
was
snug
in
bed
.
<EOS>
Sam
Weller
lighted
a
blazing
fire
in
the
room
,
and
took
up
his
dinner
;
a
bowl
of
punch
was
carried
up
afterwards
,
and
a
grand
carouse
held
in
honour
of
his
safety
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Wardle
would
not
hear
of
his
rising
,
so
they
made
the
bed
the
chair
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
presided
.
 
<EOS>
A
second
and
a
third
bowl
were
ordered
in
;
and
when
Mr
Pickwick
awoke
next
morning
,
there
was
not
a
symptom
of
rheumatism
about
him
;
which
proves
,
as
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
very
justly
observed
,
that
there
is
nothing
like
hot
punch
in
such
cases
;
and
that
if
ever
hot
punch
did
fail
to
act
as
a
preventive
,
it
was
merely
because
the
patient
fell
into
the
vulgar
error
of
not
taking
enough
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
The
jovial
party
broke
up
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Breakings
-
up
are
capital
things
in
our
school
-
days
,
but
in
after
life
they
are
painful
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Death
,
self
-
interest
,
and
fortune
's
changes
,
are
every
day
breaking
up
many
a
happy
group
,
and
scattering
them
far
and
wide
;
and
the
boys
and
girls
never
come
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
not
mean
to
say
that
it
was
exactly
the
case
in
this
particular
instance
;
all
we
wish
to
inform
the
reader
is
,
that
the
different
members
of
the
party
dispersed
to
their
several
homes
;
that
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
friends
once
more
took
their
seats
on
the
top
of
the
Muggleton
coach
;
and
that
Arabella
Allen
repaired
to
her
place
of
destination
,
wherever
it
might
have
been
<EOS>
---
we
dare
say
Mr
Winkle
knew
,
but
we
confess
we
do
n't
---
under
the
care
and
guardianship
of
her
brother
Benjamin
,
and
his
most
intimate
and
particular
friend
,
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
Before
they
separated
,
however
,
that
gentleman
and
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
drew
Mr
Pickwick
aside
with
an
air
of
some
mystery
;
and
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
thrusting
his
forefinger
between
two
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
ribs
,
and
thereby
displaying
his
native
drollery
,
and
his
knowledge
of
the
anatomy
of
the
human
frame
,
at
one
and
the
same
time
,
inquired
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
old
boy
,
where
do
you
hang
out
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
replied
that
he
was
at
present
suspended
at
the
George
and
Vulture
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
'd
come
and
see
me
,
"
said
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
would
give
me
greater
pleasure
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
my
lodgings
,
"
said
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
producing
a
card
.
"
<EOS>
Lant
Street
,

<EOS>
;
it
's
near
Guy
's
,
and
handy
for
me
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Little
distance
after
you
've
passed
St
George
's
Church
---
turns
out
of
the
High
Street
on
the
right
hand
side
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
find
it
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
on
Thursday
fortnight
,
and
bring
the
other
chaps
with
you
,
"
said
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
;
"
I
'm
going
to
have
a
few
medical
fellows
that
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
expressed
the
pleasure
it
would
afford
him
to
meet
the
medical
fellows
;
and
after
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
had
informed
him
that
he
meant
to
be
very
cosy
,
and
that
his
friend
Ben
was
to
be
one
of
the
party
,
they
shook
hands
and
separated
.
   
<EOS>
We
feel
that
in
this
place
we
lay
ourself
open
to
the
inquiry
whether
Mr
Winkle
was
whispering
,
during
this
brief
conversation
,
to
Arabella
Allen
;
and
if
so
,
what
he
said
;
and
furthermore
,
whether
Mr
Snodgrass
was
conversing
apart
with
Emily
Wardle
;
and
if
so
,
what
HE
said
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
,
we
reply
,
that
whatever
they
might
have
said
to
the
ladies
,
they
said
nothing
at
all
to
Mr
Pickwick
or
Mr
Tupman
for
eight
-
and
-
twenty
miles
,
and
that
they
sighed
very
often
,
refused
ale
and
brandy
,
and
looked
gloomy
.
 
<EOS>
If
our
observant
lady
readers
can
deduce
any
satisfactory
inferences
from
these
facts
,
we
beg
them
by
all
means
to
do
so
.

Sundry
Great
Authorities
learned
therein
 
Scattered
about
,
in
various
holes
and
corners
of
the
Temple
,
are
certain
dark
and
dirty
chambers
,
in
and
out
of
which
,
all
the
morning
in
vacation
,
and
half
the
evening
too
in
term
time
,
there
may
be
seen
constantly
hurrying
with
bundles
of
papers
under
their
arms
,
and
protruding
from
their
pockets
,
an
almost
uninterrupted
succession
of
lawyers
"
clerks
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
several
grades
of
lawyers
"
clerks
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
the
articled
clerk
,
who
has
paid
a
premium
,
and
is
an
attorney
in
perspective
,
who
runs
a
tailor
's
bill
,
receives
invitations
to
parties
,
knows
a
family
in
Gower
Street
,
and
another
in
Tavistock
Square
;
who
goes
out
of
town
every
long
vacation
to
see
his
father
,
who
keeps
live
horses
innumerable
;
and
who
is
,
in
short
,
the
very
aristocrat
of
clerks
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
the
salaried
clerk
---
out
of
door
,
or
in
door
,
as
the
case
may
be
---
who
devotes
the
major
part
of
his
thirty
shillings
a
week
to
his
Personal
pleasure
and
adornments
,
repairs
half
-
price
to
the
Adelphi
Theatre
at
least
three
times
a
week
,
dissipates
majestically
at
the
cider
cellars
afterwards
,
and
is
a
dirty
caricature
of
the
fashion
which
expired
six
months
ago
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
the
middle
-
aged
copying
clerk
,
with
a
large
family
,
who
is
always
shabby
,
and
often
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
are
the
office
lads
in
their
first
surtouts
,
who
feel
a
befitting
contempt
for
boys
at
day
-
schools
,
club
as
they
go
home
at
night
,
for
saveloys
and
porter
,
and
think
there
's
nothing
like
"
life

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
are
varieties
of
the
genus
,
too
numerous
to
recapitulate
,
but
however
numerous
they
may
be
,
they
are
all
to
be
seen
,
at
certain
regulated
business
hours
,
hurrying
to
and
from
the
places
we
have
just
mentioned
.
   
<EOS>
These
sequestered
nooks
are
the
public
offices
of
the
legal
profession
,
where
writs
are
issued
,
judgments
signed
,
declarations
filed
,
and
numerous
other
ingenious
machines
put
in
motion
for
the
torture
and
torment
of
His
Majesty
's
liege
subjects
,
and
the
comfort
and
emolument
of
the
practitioners
of
the
law
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
,
for
the
most
part
,
low
-
roofed
,
mouldy
rooms
,
where
innumerable
rolls
of
parchment
,
which
have
been
perspiring
in
secret
for
the
last
century
,
send
forth
an
agreeable
odour
,
which
is
mingled
by
day
with
the
scent
of
the
dry
-
rot
,
and
by
night
with
the
various
exhalations
which
arise
from
damp
cloaks
,
festering
umbrellas
,
and
the
coarsest
tallow
candles
.
   
<EOS>
About
half
-
past
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
some
ten
days
or
a
fortnight
after
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
friends
returned
to
London
,
there
hurried
into
one
of
these
offices
,
an
individual
in
a
brown
coat
and
brass
buttons
,
whose
long
hair
was
<EOS>
scrupulously
twisted
round
the
rim
of
his
napless
hat
,
and
<EOS>
whose
soiled
drab
trousers
were
so
tightly
strapped
over
his
Blucher
boots
,
that
his
knees
threatened
every
moment
to
start
from
their
concealment
.
<EOS>
He
produced
from
his
coat
pockets
a
long
and
narrow
strip
of
parchment
,
on
which
the
presiding
functionary
impressed
an
illegible
black
stamp
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
drew
forth
four
scraps
of
paper
,
of
similar
dimensions
,
each
containing
a
printed
copy
of
the
strip
of
parchment
with
blanks
for
a
name
;
and
having
filled
up
the
blanks
,
put
all
the
five
documents
in
his
pocket
,
and
hurried
away
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
in
the
brown
coat
,
with
the
cabalistic
documents
in
his
pocket
,
was
no
other
than
our
old
acquaintance
<EOS>
Mr
Jackson
,
of
the
house
of
Dodson
&
Fogg
,
Freeman
's
Court
,
Cornhill
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
returning
to
the
office
whence
he
came
,
however
,
he
bent
his
steps
direct
to
Sun
Court
,
and
walking
straight
into
the
George
and
Vulture
,
demanded
to
know
whether
one
Mr
Pickwick
was
within
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Call
Mr
Pickwick
's
servant
,
Tom
,
"
said
the
barmaid
of
the
George
and
Vulture
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
trouble
yourself
,
"
said
Mr
Jackson
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
come
on
business
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
'll
show
me
Mr
Pickwick
's
room
I
'll
step
up
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
name
,
Sir
?
"
said
the
waiter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jackson
,
"
replied
the
clerk
.
   
<EOS>
The
waiter
stepped
upstairs
to
announce
Mr
Jackson
;
but
Mr
Jackson
saved
him
the
trouble
by
following
close
at
his
heels
,
and
walking
into
the
apartment
before
he
could
articulate
a
syllable
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
had
,
that
day
,
invited
his
three
friends
to
dinner
;
they
were
all
seated
round
the
fire
,
drinking
their
wine
,
when
Mr
Jackson
presented
himself
,
as
above
described
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
de
do
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Jackson
,
nodding
to
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
That
gentleman
bowed
,
and
looked
somewhat
surprised
,
for
the
physiognomy
of
Mr
Jackson
dwelt
not
in
his
recollection
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
called
from
Dodson
and
Fogg
's
,
"
said
Mr
Jackson
,
in
an
explanatory
tone
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
roused
at
the
name
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
refer
you
to
my
attorney
,
Sir
;
Mr
Perker
,
of
Gray
's
Inn
,
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Waiter
,
show
this
gentleman
out
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Beg
your
pardon
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
said
Jackson
,
deliberately
depositing
his
hat
on
the
floor
,
and
drawing
from
his
pocket
the
strip
of
parchment
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
personal
service
,
by
clerk
or
agent
,
in
these
cases
,
you
know
,
Mr
Pickwick
---
nothing
like
caution
,
sir
,
in
all
legal
forms
---
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Jackson
cast
his
eye
on
the
parchment
;
and
,
resting
his
hands
on
the
table
,
and
looking
round
with
a
winning
and
persuasive
smile
,
said
,
"
Now
,
come
<EOS>
;
do
n't
let
's
have
no
words
about
such
a
little

<EOS>
Which
of
you
gentlemen
's
name
's
Snodgrass

"
   
<EOS>
At
this
inquiry
,
Mr
Snodgrass
gave
such
a
very
undisguised
and
palpable
start
,
that
no
further
reply
was
needed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
thought
so
,
"
said
Mr
Jackson
,
more
affably
than
before
.
<EOS>
"
I

little
something
to
trouble
you
with

<EOS>
"

"
exclaimed
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
only
a
subpoena
in
Bardell
and
Pickwick
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff
,
"
replied
Jackson
,
singling
out
one
of
the
slips
of
paper
,
and
producing
a
shilling
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
'll
come
on
,
in
the
settens
after
Term
:
fourteenth
of
Febooary
,
we
expect
;
we
've
marked
it
a
special
jury
cause
,
and
it
's
only
ten
down
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
yours
,
Mr
Snodgrass
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
Jackson
said
this
,
he
presented
the
parchment
before
the
eyes
of
Mr
Snodgrass
,
and
slipped
the
paper
and
the
shilling
into
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
had
witnessed
this
process
in
silent
astonishment
,
when
Jackson
,
turning
sharply
upon
him
,
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
ai
n't
mistaken
when
I
say
your
name
's
Tupman
,
am
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
looked
at
Mr
Pickwick
;
but
,
perceiving
no
encouragement
in
that
gentleman
's
widely
-
opened
eyes
to
deny
his
name
,
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
name
is
Tupman
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
that
other
gentleman
's
Mr
Winkle
,
I
think
?
"
said
Jackson
.
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
faltered
out
a
reply
in
the
affirmative
;
and
both
gentlemen
were
forthwith
invested
with
a
slip
of
paper
,
and
a
shilling
each
,
by
the
dexterous
Mr
Jackson
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Jackson
,
"
I
'm
afraid
you
'll
think
me
rather
troublesome
,
but
I
want
somebody
else
,
if
it
ai
n't
inconvenient
.
<EOS>
I
have
Samuel
Weller
's
name
here
,
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Send
my
servant
here
,
waiter
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
The
waiter
retired
,
considerably
astonished
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
motioned
Jackson
to
a
seat
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
painful
pause
,
which
was
at
length
broken
by
the
innocent
defendant
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
his
indignation
rising
while
he
spoke
---
"
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
Sir
,
that
it
is
the
intention
of
your
employers
to
seek
to
criminate
me
upon
the
testimony
of
my
own
friends
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jackson
struck
his
forefinger
several
times
against
the
left
side
of
his
nose
,
to
intimate
that
he
was
not
there
to
disclose
the
secrets
of
the
prison
house
,
and
playfully
rejoined
---
   
"
Not
knowin
'
,
ca
n't
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
what
other
reason
,
Sir
,
"
pursued
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
are
these
subpoenas
served
upon
them
,
if
not
for
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
plant
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
replied
Jackson
,
slowly
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
it
wo
n't
do
.
 
<EOS>
No
harm
in
trying
,
but
there
's
little
to
be
got
out
of
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Jackson
smiled
once
more
upon
the
company
,
and
,
applying
his
left
thumb
to
the
tip
of
his
nose
,
worked
a
visionary
coffee
-
mill
with
his
right
hand
,
thereby
performing
a
very
graceful
piece
of
pantomime
(
then
much
in
vogue
,
but
now
,
unhappily
,
almost
obsolete
)
which
was
familiarly
denominated
"
taking
a
grinder
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
said
Jackson
,
in
conclusion
;
"
Perker
's
people
must
guess
what
we
've
served
these
subpoenas
for
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
ca
n't
,
they
must
wait
till
the
action
comes
on
,
and
then
they
'll
find
out
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
bestowed
a
look
of
excessive
disgust
on
his
unwelcome
visitor
,
and
would
probably
have
hurled
some
tremendous
anathema
at
the
heads
of
Messrs.
Dodson
&
Fogg
,
had
not
Sam
's
entrance
at
the
instant
interrupted
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Samuel
Weller
?
"
said
Mr
Jackson
,
inquiringly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Vun
o
'
<EOS>
the
truest
things
as
you
've
said
for
many
a
long
year
,
"
replied
Sam
,
in
a
most
composed
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
subpoena
for
you
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
Jackson
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
in
English
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
the
original
,
"
said
Jackson
,
declining
the
required
explanation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Which
?
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
replied
Jackson
,
shaking
the
parchment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
's
the
"
rig'nal
,
is
it
?
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'm
wery
glad
I
've
seen
the
"
rig'nal
,
"
<EOS>
cos
it
's
a
gratifyin
'
<EOS>
sort
o
'
thing
,
and
eases
vun
's
mind
so
much
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
here
's
the
shilling
,
"
said
Jackson
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
from
Dodson
and
Fogg
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
it
's
uncommon
handsome
o
'
Dodson
and
Fogg
,
as
knows
so
little
of
me
,
to
come
down
vith
a
present
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
it
as
a
wery
high
compliment
,
sir
;
it
's
a
wery
honorable
thing
to
them
,
as
they
knows
how
to
reward
merit
werever
they
meets
it

<EOS>
Besides
which
,
it
's
affectin

to

"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Weller
said
this
,
he
inflicted
a
little
friction
on
his
right
eyelid
,
with
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
,
after
the
most
approved
manner
of
actors
when
they
are
in
domestic
pathetics
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jackson
seemed
rather
puzzled
by
Sam
's
proceedings
;
but
,
as
he
had
served
the
subpoenas
,
and
had
nothing
more
to
say
,
he
made
a
feint
of
putting
on
the
one
glove
which
he
usually
carried
in
his
hand
,
for
the
sake
of
appearances
;
and
returned
to
the
office
to
report
progress
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
slept
little
that
night
;
his
memory
had
received
a
very
disagreeable
refresher
on
the
subject
of
Mrs
Bardell
's
action
.
 
<EOS>
He
breakfasted
betimes
next
morning
,
and
,
desiring
Sam
to
accompany
him
,
set
forth
towards
Gray
's
Inn
Square
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
round
,
when
they
got
to
the
end
of
Cheapside
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
?
"
said
Sam
,
stepping
up
to
his
master
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Which
way
?
"
<EOS>
"
Up
Newgate
Street
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
did
not
turn
round
immediately
,
but
looked
vacantly
in
Sam
's
face
for
a
few
seconds
,
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
action
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
is
expected
to
come
on
,
on
the
fourteenth
of
next
month
.
"
<EOS>
"
Remarkable
coincidence
that
'
ere
,
sir
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
remarkable
,
Sam
?
"
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Walentine
's
day
,
sir
,
"
responded
Sam
;
"
<EOS>
reg'lar
good
day
for
a
breach
o
'
promise
trial
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
's
smile
awakened
no
gleam
of
mirth
in
his
master
's
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
turned
abruptly
round
,
and
led
the
way
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
They
had
walked
some
distance
,
Mr
Pickwick
trotting
on
before
,
plunged
in
profound
meditation
,
and
Sam
following
behind
,
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
the
most
enviable
and
easy
defiance
of
everything
and
everybody
,
when
the
latter
,
who
was
always
especially
anxious
to
impart
to
his
master
any
exclusive
information
he
possessed
,
quickened
his
pace
until
he
was
close
at
Mr
Pickwick
's
heels
;
and
,
pointing
up
at
a
house
they
were
passing
,
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
nice
pork
-
shop
that
'
ere
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
seems
so
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Celebrated
sassage
factory
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
!
"
<EOS>
reiterated
Sam
,
with
some
indignation
;
"
I
should
rayther
think
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
sir
,
bless
your
innocent
eyebrows
,
that
's
where
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
a
"
spectable
tradesman
took
place
four
years
ago
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
he
was
burked
,
Sam
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
hastily
round
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
do
n't
indeed
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
,
"
<EOS>
I
wish
I
did
;
far
worse
than
that
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
master
o

that
'
ere

,
sir

and
the
inwentor
o

the

as
easy

if
it
was
a
tender
young
babby

<EOS>
Wery
proud
o

that
machine

wen
<EOS>
it
was
in

at

<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell

he
says
one
day
;
"
if

sort
of

he
says
,
"
I
'm
blessed

she
,

<EOS>
Arter
which
she
keeps
on
abusin

of
him
for
half
an
hour
,
and
then
runs
into
the
little
parlour
behind
the
shop
,
sets
to
a

screamin

says
he
'll

Well

He

Merriker

<EOS>
Did

did

seein

that
he

;
the

dragged

for
two

wenever
a

Hows'ever

One
Saturday
night

a

thin

comes
into

the

in

temporary
insanity
he
rashly
converted

sassages

<EOS>
And
so
he

said
Mr

,
looking
steadily
into
Mr

horror
-
stricken
countenance
,
"

else

however

the
little

been
remarkably
partial

"
   
<EOS>
The
relation
of
this
affecting
incident
of
private
life
brought
master
and
man
to
Mr
Perker
's
chambers
.
 
<EOS>
Lowten
,
holding
the
door
half
open
,
was
in
conversation
with
a
rustily
-
clad
,
miserable
-
looking
man
,
in
boots
without
toes
and
gloves
without
fingers
.
<EOS>
There
were
traces
of
privation
and
suffering
---
almost
of
despair
 
---
in
his
lank
and
care
-
worn
countenance
;
he
felt
his
poverty
,
for
he
shrank
to
the
dark
side
of
the
staircase
as
Mr
Pickwick
approached
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
unfortunate
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
with
a
sigh
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
,
"
said
Lowten
,
scribbling
his
name
on
the
doorpost
with
his
pen
,
and
rubbing
it
out
again
with
the
feather
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
leave
a
message
for
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
do
you
think
he
'll
be
back
?
"
inquired
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
uncertain
,
"
replied
Lowten
,
winking
at
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
the
stranger
cast
his
eyes
towards
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
think
it
would
be
of
any
use
my
waiting
for
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
the
stranger
,
looking
wistfully
into
the
office
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
I
'm
sure
it
would
n't
,
"
replied
the
clerk
,
moving
a
little
more
into
the
centre
of
the
doorway
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
certain
not
to
be
back
this
week
,
and
it
's
a
chance
whether
he
will
be
next
;
for
when
Perker
once
gets
out
of
town
,
he
's
never
in
a
hurry
to
come
back
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Out
of
town
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
dear
me
,
how
unfortunate
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
go
away
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
said
Lowten
,
"
I
've
got
a
letter
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
,
seeming
to
hesitate
,
once
more
looked
towards
the
ground
,
and
the
clerk
winked
slyly
at
Mr
PickwiCK
,
as
if
to
intimate
that
some
exquisite
piece
of
humour
was
going
forward
,
though
what
it
was
Mr
Pickwick
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
divine
.
<EOS>
"
Step
in
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
said
Lowten
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
will
you
leave
a
message
,
Mr
Watty
,
or
<EOS>
will
you
call
again
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ask
him
to
be
so
kind
as
to
leave
out
word
what
has
been
done
in
my
business
,
"
said
the
man
;
"
for
God
's
sake
do
n't
neglect
it
,
Mr
Lowten
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
I
wo
n't
forget
it
,
"
replied
the
clerk
.
 
<EOS>
"
Walk
in
,
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
morning
,
<EOS>
Mr
Watty
;
it
's
a
fine
day
for
walking
,
is
n't
it
?
"
<EOS>
Seeing
that
the
stranger
still
lingered
,
he
beckoned
Sam
Weller
to
follow
his
master
in
,
and
shut
the
door
in
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
never
was
such
a
pestering
bankrupt
as
that
since
the
world
began
,
I
do
believe
!
<EOS>
"
said
Lowten
,
throwing
down
his
pen
with
the
air
of
an
injured
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
affairs
have
n't
been
in
Chancery
quite
four
years
yet
,
and
I
'm
d####d
if
he
do
n't
come
worrying
here
twice
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
Step
this
way
,
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
Perker
IS
in
,
and
he
'll
see
you
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
Devilish
cold
,
"
he
added
pettishly
,
"
standing
at
that
door
,
wasting
one
's
time
with
such
seedy
vagabonds
!
"
<EOS>
Having
very
vehemently
stirred
a
particularly
large
fire
with
a
particularly
small
poker
,
the
clerk
led
the
way
to
his
principal
's
private
room
,
and
announced
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
said
little
Mr
Perker
,
bustling
up
from
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
sir
,
and
what
's
the
news
about
your
matter
,
eh
?
 
Anything
more
about
our
friends
in
Freeman
's
Court
?
<EOS>
They
've
not
been
sleeping
,
I
know
that
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
they
're
very
smart
fellows
;
very
smart
,
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
little
man
concluded
,
he
took
an
emphatic
pinch
of
snuff
,
as
a
tribute
to
the
smartness
of
Messrs.
Dodson
and
Fogg
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
are
great
scoundrels
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
said
the
little
man
;
"
that
's
a
matter
of
opinion
,
you
know
,
and
we
wo
n't
dispute
about
terms
;
because
of
course
you
ca
n't
be
expected
to
view
these
subjects
with
a
professional
eye
.
<EOS>
Well
,
we
've
done
everything
that
's
necessary
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
retained
Serjeant
Snubbin
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
a
good
man
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
man
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Perker
<EOS>
;
"
bless
your
heart
and
soul
,
my
dear
Sir
,
Serjeant
Snubbin
is
at
the
very
top
of
his
profession
.
<EOS>
Gets
treble
the
business
of
any
man
in
court
---
engaged
in
every
case
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
n't
mention
it
abroad
;
but
we
say
---
we
of
the
profession
---
that
Serjeant
Snubbin
leads
the
court
by
the
nose
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
little
man
took
another
pinch
of
snuff
as
he
made
this
communication
,
and
nodded
mysteriously
to
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
have
subpoenaed
my
three
friends
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
of
course
they
would
,
"
replied
Perker
.
 
<EOS>
"
Important
witnesses
;
saw
you
in
a
delicate
situation
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
she
fainted
of
her
own
accord
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
threw
herself
into
my
arms
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
replied
Perker
;
"
very
likely
and
very
natural
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
<EOS>
more
so
,
my
dear
Sir
,
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
But
who
's
to
prove
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
have
subpoenaed
my
servant
,
too
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
quitting
the
other
point
;
for
there
Mr
Perker
's
question
had
somewhat
staggered
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
?
<EOS>
"
said
Perker
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
,
my
dear
Sir
;
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
they
would
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
told
you
that
,
a
month
ago
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
,
my
dear
Sir
,
if
you
WILL
take
the
management
of
your
affairs
into
your
own
hands
after
entrusting
them
to
your
solicitor
,
you
must
also
take
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Perker
drew
himself
up
with
conscious
dignity
,
and
brushed
some
stray
grains
of
snuff
from
his
shirt
frill
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
they
want
him
to
prove
?
"
asked
Mr
Pickwick
,
after
two
or
three
minutes
"
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
you
sent
him
up
to
the
plaintiff
"
s
to
make
some
offer
of
a
compromise
,
I
suppose
,
"
replied
Perker
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
do
n't
matter
much
,
though
;
I
do
n't
think
many
counsel
could
get
a
great
deal
out
of
HIM
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
they
could
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
smiling
,
despite
his
vexation
,
at
the
idea
of
Sam
's
appearance
as
a
witness
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
course
do
we
pursue
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
only
one
to
adopt
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
replied
Perker
;
"
cross
-
examine
the
witnesses
;
trust
to
Snubbin
's
eloquence
;
throw
dust
in
the
eyes
of
the
judge
;
throw
ourselves
on
the
jury
.
"
   
"
And
suppose
the
verdict
is
against
me
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Perker
smiled
,
took
a
very
long
pinch
of
snuff
,
stirred
the
fire
,
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
remained
expressively
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
mean
that
in
that
case
I
must
pay
the
damages
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
had
watched
this
telegraphic
answer
with
considerable
sternness
.
   
<EOS>
Perker
gave
the
fire
another
very
unnecessary
poke
,
and
said
,
"
I
am
afraid
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
beg
to
announce
to
you
my
unalterable
determination
to
pay
no
damages
whatever
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
most
emphatically
.
 
<EOS>
"
None
,
Perker
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
pound
,
not
a
penny
of
my
money
,
shall
find
its
way
into
the
pockets
of
Dodson
and
Fogg
.
<EOS>
That
is
my
deliberate
and
irrevocable
determination
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
gave
a
heavy
blow
on
the
table
before
him
,
in
confirmation
of
the
irrevocability
of
his
intention
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
,
my
dear
Sir
,
very
well
,
"
said
Perker
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
best
,
of
course
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
does
Serjeant
Snubbin
live
?
"
<EOS>
"
In
Lincoln
's
Inn
Old
Square
,
"
replied
Perker
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see
him
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
See
Serjeant
Snubbin
,
my
dear
Sir
!
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Perker
,
in
utter
amazement
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pooh
,
pooh
,
my
dear
Sir
,
impossible
.
 
See
Serjeant
Snubbin
!
 
<EOS>
Bless
you
,
my
dear
Sir
,
such
a
thing
was
never
heard
of
,
without
a
consultation
fee
being
previously
paid
,
and
a
consultation
fixed
.
 
<EOS>
It
could
n't
be
done
,
my
dear
Sir
;
it
could
n't
be
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
however
,
had
made
up
his
mind
not
only
that
it
could
be
done
,
but
that
it
should
be
done
;
and
the
consequence
was
,
that
within
ten
minutes
after
he
had
received
the
assurance
that
the
thing
was
impossible
,
he
was
conducted
by
his
solicitor
into
the
outer
office
of
the
great
Serjeant
Snubbin
himself
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
an
uncarpeted
room
of
tolerable
dimensions
,
with
a
large
writing
-
table
drawn
up
near
the
fire
,
the
baize
top
of
which
had
long
since
lost
all
claim
to
its
original
hue
of
green
,
and
had
gradually
grown
gray
with
dust
and
age
,
except
where
all
traces
of
its
natural
colour
were
obliterated
by
ink
-
stains
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
the
table
were
numerous
little
bundles
of
papers
tied
with
red
tape
;
and
behind
it
,
sat
an
elderly
clerk
,
whose
sleek
appearance
and
heavy
gold
watch
-
chain
presented
imposing
indications
of
the
extensive
and
lucrative
practice
of
Mr
Serjeant
Snubbin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
the
Serjeant
in
his
room
,
Mr
Mallard
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Perker
,
offering
his
box
with
all
imaginable
courtesy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
is
,
"
was
the
reply
,
"
but
he
's
very
busy
.
 
<EOS>
Look
here
;
not
an
opinion
given
yet
,
on
any
one
of
these
cases
;
and
an
expedition
fee
paid
with
all
of
'
em
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
clerk
smiled
as
he
said
this
,
and
inhaled
the
pinch
of
snuff
with
a
zest
which
seemed
to
be
compounded
of
a
fondness
for
snuff
and
a
relish
for
fees
.
   
<EOS>
"
Something
like
practice
that
,
"
said
Perker
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
barrister
's
clerk
,
producing
his
own
box
,
and
offering
it
with
the
greatest
cordiality
;
"
and
the
best
of
it
is
,
that
as
nobody
alive
except
myself
can
read
the
serjeant
's
writing
,
they
are
obliged
to
wait
for
the
opinions
,
when
he
has
given
them
,
till
I
have
copied
'em
,
ha
-
ha
-
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Which
makes
good
for
we
know
who
,
besides
the
serjeant
,
and
draws
a
little
more
out
of
the
clients
,
eh
?
"
said
Perker
;
"
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
<EOS>
At
this
the
serjeant
's
clerk
laughed
again
---
not
a
noisy
boisterous
laugh
,
but
a
silent
,
internal
chuckle
,
which
Mr
Pickwick
disliked
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
When
a
man
bleeds
inwardly
,
it
is
a
dangerous
thing
for
himself
;
but
when
he
laughs
inwardly
,
it
bodes
no
good
to
other
people
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
made
me
out
that
little
list
of
the
fees
that
I
'm
in
your
debt
,
have
you
?
"
said
Perker
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
have
not
,
"
replied
the
clerk
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
,
"
said
Perker
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
have
them
,
and
I
'll
send
you
a
cheque
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
suppose
you
're
too
busy
pocketing
the
ready
money
,
to
think
of
the
debtors
,
eh
?
<EOS>
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
<EOS>
This
sally
seemed
to
tickle
the
clerk
amazingly
,
and
he
once
more
enjoyed
a
little
quiet
laugh
to
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
Mr
Mallard
,
my
dear
friend
,
"
said
Perker
,
suddenly
recovering
his
gravity
,
and
drawing
the
great
man
's
great
man
into
a
Corner
,
by
the
lappel
of
his
coat
;
"
you
must
persuade
the
Serjeant
to
see
me
,
and
my
client
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
"
said
the
clerk
,
"
<EOS>
that
's
not
bad
either
.
 
<EOS>
See
the
Serjeant
!
<EOS>
come
,
that
's
too
absurd
.
"
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
absurdity
of
the
proposal
,
however
,
the
clerk
allowed
himself
to
be
gently
drawn
beyond
the
hearing
of
Mr
Pickwick
;
and
after
a
short
conversation
conducted
in
whispers
,
walked
softly
down
a
little
dark
passage
,
and
disappeared
into
the
legal
luminary
's
sanctum
,
whence
he
shortly
returned
on
tiptoe
,
and
informed
Mr
Perker
and
Mr
Pickwick
that
the
Serjeant
had
been
prevailed
upon
,
in
violation
of
all
established
rules
and
customs
,
to
admit
them
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Serjeant
Snubbins
was
a
lantern
-
faced
,
sallow
-
complexioned
man
,
of
about
five
-
and
-
forty
,
or
---
as
the
novels
say
---
he
might
be
fifty
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
that
dull
-
looking
,
boiled
eye
which
is
often
to
be
seen
in
the
heads
of
people
who
have
applied
themselves
during
many
years
to
a
weary
and
laborious
course
of
study
;
and
which
would
have
been
sufficient
,
without
the
additional
eyeglass
which
dangled
from
a
broad
black
riband
round
his
neck
,
to
warn
a
stranger
that
he
was
very
near
-
sighted
.
 
<EOS>
His
hair
was
thin
and
weak
,
which
was
partly
attributable
to
his
having
never
devoted
much
time
to
its
arrangement
,
and
partly
to
his
having
worn
for
five
-
and
-
twenty
years
<EOS>
the
forensic
wig
which
hung
on
a
block
beside
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
marks
of
hairpowder
on
his
coat
-
collar
,
and
the
ill
-
washed
and
worse
tied
white
neckerchief
round
his
throat
,
showed
that
he
had
not
found
leisure
since
he
left
the
court
to
make
any
alteration
in
his
dress
;
while
the
slovenly
style
of
the
remainder
of
his
costume
warranted
the
inference
that
his
personal
appearance
would
not
have
been
very
much
improved
if
he
had
.
 
<EOS>
Books
of
practice
,
heaps
of
papers
,
and
opened
letters
,
were
scattered
over
the
table
,
without
any
attempt
at
order
or
arrangement
;
the
furniture
of
the
room
was
old
and
rickety
;
the
doors
of
the
book
-
case
were
rotting
in
their
hinges
;
the
dust
flew
out
from
the
carpet
in
little
clouds
at
every
step
;
the
blinds
were
yellow
with
age
and
dirt
;
the
state
of
everything
in
the
room
showed
,
with
a
clearness
not
to
be
mistaken
,
that
Mr
Serjeant
Snubbin
was
far
too
much
occupied
with
his
professional
pursuits
to
take
any
great
heed
or
regard
of
his
personal
comforts
.
   
<EOS>
The
Serjeant
was
writing
when
his
clients
entered
;
he
bowed
abstractedly
when
Mr
Pickwick
was
introduced
by
his
solicitor
;
and
then
,
motioning
them
to
a
seat
,
put
his
pen
carefully
in
the
inkstand
,
nursed
his
left
leg
,
and
waited
to
be
spoken
to
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
is
the
defendant
in
Bardell
and
Pickwick
,
Serjeant
Snubbin
,
"
said
Perker
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
retained
in
that
,
am
I
?
"
said
the
Serjeant
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Perker
.
   
<EOS>
The
Serjeant
nodded
his
head
,
and
waited
for
something
else
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
anxious
to
call
upon
you
,
Serjeant
Snubbin
,
"
said
Perker
,
"
to
state
to
you
,
before
you
entered
upon
the
case
,
that
he
denies
there
being
any
ground
or
pretence
<EOS>
whatever
for
the
action
against
him
;
and
that
unless
he
came
into
court
with
clean
hands
,
and
without
the
most
conscientious
conviction
that
he
was
right
in
resisting
the
plaintiff
's
demand
,
he
would
not
be
there
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
state
your
views
correctly
;
do
I
not
,
my
dear
Sir
?
"
said
the
little
man
,
turning
to
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
so
,
"
replied
that
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Serjeant
Snubbin
unfolded
his
glasses
,
raised
them
to
his
eyes
;
and
,
after
looking
at
Mr
Pickwick
for
a
few
seconds
with
great
curiosity
,
turned
to
Mr
Perker
,
and
said
,
smiling
slightly
as
he
spoke
---
"
<EOS>
Has
Mr
Pickwick
a
strong
case
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
attorney
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
propose
calling
witnesses
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
smile
on
the
Serjeant
's
countenance
became
more
defined
;
he
rocked
his
leg
with
increased
violence
;
and
,
throwing
himself
back
in
his
easy
-
chair
,
coughed
dubiously
.
   
<EOS>
These
tokens
of
the
Serjeant
's
presentiments
on
the
subject
,
slight
as
they
were
,
were
not
lost
on
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
He
settled
the
spectacles
,
through
which
he
had
attentively
regarded
such
demonstrations
of
the
barrister
's
feelings
as
he
had
permitted
himself
to
exhibit
,
more
firmly
on
his
nose
;
and
said
with
great
energy
,
and
in
utter
disregard
of
all
Mr
Perker
's
admonitory
winkings
and
frownings
---
   
<EOS>
"
My
wishing
to
wait
upon
you
,
for
such
a
purpose
as
this
,
Sir
,
appears
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
to
a
gentleman
who
sees
so
much
of
these
matters
as
you
must
necessarily
do
,
a
very
extraordinary
circumstance
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Serjeant
tried
to
look
gravely
at
the
fire
,
but
the
smile
came
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
of
your
profession
,
Sir
,
"
continued
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
see
the
worst
side
of
human
nature
.
 
<EOS>
All
its
disputes
,
all
its
ill
-
will
and
bad
blood
,
rise
up
before
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
from
your
experience
of
juries
(
I
mean
no
disparagement
to
you
,
or
them
)
<EOS>
how
much
depends
upon
effect
;
and
you
are
apt
to
attribute
to
others
,
a
desire
to
use
,
for
purposes
of
deception
and
Self
-
interest
,
the
very
instruments
which
you
,
in
pure
honesty
and
honour
of
purpose
,
and
with
a
laudable
desire
to
do
your
utmost
for
your
client
,
know
the
temper
and
worth
of
<EOS>
so
well
,
from
constantly
employing
them
yourselves
.
 
<EOS>
I
really
believe
that
to
this
circumstance
may
be
attributed
the
vulgar
but
very
general
notion
of
your
being
,
as
a
body
,
suspicious
,
distrustful
,
and
over
-
cautious
.
<EOS>
Conscious
as
I
am
,
sir
,
of
the
disadvantage
of
making
such
a
declaration
to
you
,
under
such
circumstances
,
I
have
come
here
,
because
I
wish
you
distinctly
to
understand
,
as
my
friend
Mr
Perker
has
said
,
that
I
am
innocent
of
the
falsehood
laid
to
my
charge
;
and
although
I
am
very
well
aware
of
the
inestimable
value
of
your
assistance
,
Sir
,
I
must
beg
to
add
,
that
unless
you
sincerely
believe
this
,
I
would
rather
be
deprived
of
the
aid
of
your
talents
than
have
the
advantage
of
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
Long
before
the
close
of
this
address
,
which
we
are
bound
to
say
was
of
a
very
prosy
character
for
Mr
Pickwick
,
the
Serjeant
had
relapsed
into
a
state
of
abstraction
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
minutes
,
however
,
during
which
he
had
reassumed
his
pen
,
he
appeared
to
be
again
aware
of
the
presence
of
his
clients
;
raising
his
head
from
the
paper
,
he
said
,
rather
snappishly
---
   
<EOS>
"
Who
is
with
me
in
this
case
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Phunky
,
Serjeant
Snubbin
,
"
replied
the
attorney
.
   
<EOS>
"
Phunky
---
Phunky
,
"
said
the
Serjeant
,
"
I
never
heard
the
name
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
be
a
very
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
is
a
very
young
man
,
"
replied
the
attorney
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
only
called
the
other
day
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
see
<EOS>
---
he
has
not
been
at
the
Bar
eight
years
yet
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
I
thought
not
,
"
said
the
Serjeant
,
in
that
sort
of
pitying
tone
in
which
ordinary
folks
would
speak
of
a
very
helpless
little
child
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Mallard
,
send
round
to
Mr
---
Mr

"
"
Phunky
's

Holborn
Court

interposed
Perker
.
 
<EOS>
(
Holborn
Court
,
by
the
bye
,
is
South
Square
now
.
)
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Phunky
,
and
say
I
should
be
glad
if
he
'd
step
here
,
a
moment
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Mallard
departed
to
execute
his
commission
;
and
Serjeant
Snubbin
relapsed
into
abstraction
until
Mr
Phunky
himself
was
introduced
.
   
<EOS>
Although
an
infant
barrister
,
he
was
a
full
-
grown
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
very
nervous
manner
,
and
a
painful
hesitation
in
his
speech
;
it
did
not
appear
to
be
a
natural
defect
,
but
seemed
rather
the
result
of
timidity
,
arising
from
the
consciousness
of
being
"
kept
down
"
by
want
of
means
,
or
interest
,
or
connection
,
or
impudence
,
as
the
case
might
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
overawed
by
the
Serjeant
,
and
profoundly
courteous
to
the
attorney
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
before
,
Mr
Phunky
,
"
said
Serjeant
Snubbin
,
with
haughty
condescension
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Phunky
bowed
.
 
<EOS>
He
HAD
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
Serjeant
,
and
of
envying
him
too
,
with
all
a
poor
man
's
envy
,
for
eight
years
and
a
quarter
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
with
me
in
this
case
,
I
understand
?
"
said
the
Serjeant
.
   
<EOS>
If
Mr
Phunky
had
been
a
rich
man
,
he
would
have
instantly
sent
for
his
clerk
to
remind
him
;
if
he
had
been
a
wise
one
,
he
would
have
applied
his
forefinger
to
his
forehead
,
and
endeavoured
to
recollect
,
whether
,
in
the
multiplicity
of
his
engagements
,
he
had
undertaken
this
one
or
not
;
but
as
he
was
neither
rich
nor
wise
(
in
this
sense
,
at
all
events
)
<EOS>
he
turned
red
,
and
bowed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
read
the
papers
,
Mr
Phunky
?
"
inquired
the
Serjeant
.
   
<EOS>
Here
again
,
Mr
Phunky
should
have
professed
to
have
forgotten
all
about
the
merits
of
the
case
;
but
as
he
had
read
such
papers
as
had
been
laid
before
him
in
the
course
of
the
action
,
and
had
thought
of
nothing
else
,
waking
or
sleeping
,
throughout
the
two
months
during
which
he
had
been
retained
as
Mr
Serjeant
Snubbin
's
junior
,
he
turned
a
deeper
red
and
bowed
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
said
the
Serjeant
,
waving
his
pen
in
the
direction
in
which
that
gentleman
was
standing
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Phunky
bowed
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
a
reverence
which
a
first
client
must
ever
awaken
;
and
again
inclined
his
head
towards
his
leader
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
will
take
Mr
Pickwick
away
,
"
said
the
Serjeant
,
"
and
---
<EOS>
and
---
and
---
hear
anything
Mr
Pickwick
may
wish
to
communicate
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
have
a
consultation
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
that
hint
that
he
had
been
interrupted
quite
long
enough
,
Mr
Serjeant
Snubbin
,
who
had
been
gradually
growing
more
and
more
abstracted
,
applied
his
glass
to
his
eyes
for
an
instant
,
bowed
slightly
round
,
and
was
once
more
deeply
immersed
in
the
case
before
him
,
which
arose
out
of
an
interminable
lawsuit
,
originating
in
the
act
of
an
individual
,
deceased
a
century
or
so
ago
,
who
had
stopped
up
a
pathway
leading
from
some
place
which
nobody
ever
came
from
,
to
some
other
place
which
nobody
ever
went
to
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Phunky
would
not
hear
of
passing
through
any
door
until
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
solicitor
had
passed
through
before
him
,
so
it
was
some
time
before
they
got
into
the
Square
;
and
when
they
did
reach
it
,
they
walked
up
and
down
,
and
held
a
long
conference
,
<EOS>
the
result
of
which
was
,
that
it
was
a
very
difficult
matter
to
say
how
the
verdict
would
go
;
that
nobody
could
presume
to
calculate
on
the
issue
of
an
action
;
that
it
was
very
lucky
they
had
prevented
the
other
party
from
getting
Serjeant
Snubbin
;
and
other
topics
of
doubt
and
consolation
,
common
in
such
a
position
of
affairs
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
was
then
roused
by
his
master
from
a
sweet
sleep
of
an
hour
's
duration
;
and
,
bidding
adieu
to
Lowten
,
they
returned
to
the
city
.

Describes
,
far
more
fully
than
the
Court
Newsman
ever
did
,
a
Bachelor
's
party
,
given
by
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
at
his
lodgings
in
the
Borough
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
repose
about
Lant
Street
,
in
the
Borough
,
which
sheds
a
gentle
melancholy
upon
the
soul
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
always
a
good
many
houses
to
let
in
the
street
:
it
is
a
by
-
street
too
,
and
its
dulness
is
soothing
.
 
<EOS>
A
house
in
Lant
Street
would
not
come
within
the
denomination
of
a
first
-
rate
residence
,
in
the
strict
acceptation
of
the
term
;
but
it
is
a
most
desirable
spot
nevertheless
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
man
wished
to
abstract
himself
from
the
world
---
to
remove
himself
from
within
the
reach
of
temptation
---
to
place
himself
beyond
the
possibility
of
any
inducement
to
look
out
of
the
window
---
we
should
recommend
him
by
all
means
go
to
Lant
Street
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
happy
retreat
are
colonised
a
few
clear
-
starchers
,
a
sprinkling
of
journeymen
bookbinders
,
one
or
two
prison
agents
for
the
Insolvent
Court
,
several
small
housekeepers
who
are
employed
in
the
Docks
,
a
handful
of
mantua
-
makers
,
and
a
seasoning
of
jobbing
tailors
.
 
<EOS>
The
majority
of
the
inhabitants
either
direct
their
energies
to
the
letting
of
furnished
apartments
,
or
devote
themselves
to
the
healthful
and
invigorating
pursuit
of
mangling
.
 
<EOS>
The
chief
features
in
the
still
life
of
the
street
are
green
shutters
,
lodging
-
bills
,
brass
door
-
plates
,
and
bell
-
handles
;
the
principal
specimens
of
animated
nature
,
the
pot
-
boy
,
the
muffin
youth
,
and
the
baked

potato
man
.
 
<EOS>
The
population
is
migratory
,
usually
disappearing
on
the
verge
of
quarter
-
day
,
and
generally
by
night
.
 
<EOS>
His
Majesty
's
revenues
are
seldom
collected
in
this
happy
valley
;
the
rents
are
dubious
;
and
the
water
communication
is
very
frequently
cut
off
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
embellished
one
side
of
the
fire
,
in
his
first
-
floor
front
,
early
on
the
evening
for
which
he
had
invited
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
Mr
Ben
Allen
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
The
preparations
for
the
reception
of
visitors
appeared
to
be
completed
.
 
<EOS>
The
umbrellas
in
the
passage
had
been
heaped
into
the
little
corner
outside
the
back
-
parlour
door
;
the
bonnet
and
shawl
of
the
landlady
's
servant
had
been
removed
from
the
bannisters
;
there
were
not
more
than
two
pairs
of
pattens
on
the
street
-
door
mat
;
and
a
kitchen
candle
,
with
a
very
long
snuff
,
burned
cheerfully
on
the
ledge
of
the
staircase
window
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
had
himself
purchased
the
spirits
at
a
wine
vaults
in
High
Street
,
and
had
returned
home
preceding
the
bearer
thereof
,
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
their
delivery
at
the
wrong
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
punch
was
ready
-
made
in
a
red
pan
in
the
bedroom
;
a
little
table
,
covered
with
a
green
baize
cloth
,
had
been
borrowed
from
the
parlour
,
to
play
at
cards
on
;
and
the
glasses
of
the
establishment
,
together
with
those
which
had
been
borrowed
for
the
occasion
from
the
public
-
house
,
were
all
drawn
up
in
a
tray
,
which
was
deposited
on
the
landing
outside
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
highly
satisfactory
nature
of
all
these
arrangements
,
there
was
a
cloud
on
the
countenance
of
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
as
he
sat
by
the
fireside
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
sympathising
expression
,
too
,
in
the
features
of
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
as
he
gazed
intently
on
the
coals
,
and
a
tone
of
melancholy
in
his
voice
,
as
he
said
,
after
a
long
silence
---
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
is
unlucky
she
should
have
taken
it
in
her
head
to
turn
sour
,
just
on
this
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
She
might
at
least
have
waited
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
her
malevolence
<EOS>
---
that
's
her
malevolence
,
"
returned
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
vehemently
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
says
that
if
I
can
afford
to
give
a
party
I
ought
to
be
able
to
pay
her
confounded
"
little
bill
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
How
long
has
it
been
running
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Ben
Allen
.
 
<EOS>
A
bill
,
by
the
bye
,
is
the
most
extraordinary
locomotive
engine
that
the
genius
of
man
ever
produced
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
keep
on
running
during
the
longest
lifetime
,
without
ever
once
stopping
of
its
own
accord
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
a
quarter
,
and
a
month
or
so
,
"
replied
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
Ben
Allen
coughed
hopelessly
,
and
directed
a
searching
look
between
the
two
top
bars
of
the
stove
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
'll
be
a
deuced
unpleasant
thing
if
she
takes
it
into
her
head
to
let
out
,
when
those
fellows
are
here
,
wo
n't
it
?
"
said
Mr
Ben
Allen
at
length
.
   
<EOS>
"
Horrible
,
"
replied
Bob
Sawyer
,
"
horrible
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
low
tap
was
heard
at
the
room
door
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
looked
expressively
at
his
friend
,
and
bade
the
tapper
come
in
;
whereupon
a
dirty
,
slipshod
girl
in
black
cotton
stockings
,
who
might
have
passed
for
the
neglected
daughter
of
a
superannuated
dustman
in
very
reduced
circumstances
,
thrust
in
her
head
,
and
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
Please
,
Mister
Sawyer
,
Missis
Raddle
wants
to
speak
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Before
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
could
return
any
answer
,
the
girl
suddenly
disappeared
with
a
jerk
,
as
if
somebody
had
given
her
a
violent
pull
behind
;
this
mysterious
exit
was
no
sooner
accomplished
,
than
there
was
another
tap
at
the
door
---
a
smart
,
pointed
tap
,
which
seemed
to
say
,
"
Here
I
am
,
and
in
I
'm
coming
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
,
Bob
Sawyer
glanced
at
his
friend
with
a
look
of
abject
apprehension
,
and
once
more
cried
,
"
Come
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
permission
was
not
at
all
necessary
,
for
,
before
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
had
uttered
the
words
,
a
little
,
fierce
woman
bounced
into
the
room
,
all
in
a
tremble
with
passion
,
and
pale
with
rage
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr
Sawyer
,
"
said
the
little
,
fierce
woman
,
trying
to
appear
very
calm
,
"
if
you
'll
have
the
kindness
to
settle
that
little
bill
of
mine
<EOS>
I
'll
thank
you
,
because
I
've
got
my
rent
to
pay
this
afternoon
,
and
my
landlord
's
a
-
waiting
below
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Here
the
little
woman
rubbed
her
hands
,
and
looked
steadily
over
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
's
head
,
at
the
wall
behind
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
to
put
you
to
any
inconvenience
,
Mrs
Raddle
,
"
said
Bob
Sawyer
deferentially
,
"
<EOS>
but
---
"
   
"
Oh
,
it
is
n't
any
inconvenience
,
"
replied
the
little
woman
,
with
a
shrill
titter
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
want
it
particular
before
to
-
day
;
leastways
,
as
it
has
to
go
to
my
landlord
directly
,
it
was
as
well
for
you
to
keep
it
as
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
promised
me
this
afternoon
,
Mr
Sawyer
,
and
every
gentleman
as
has
ever
lived
here
,
has
kept
his
word
,
Sir
,
as
of
course
anybody
as
calls
himself
a
gentleman
does
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Raddle
tossed
her
head
,
bit
her
lips
,
rubbed
her
hands
harder
,
and
looked
at
the
wall
more
steadily
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
plain
to
see
,
as
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
remarked
in
a
style
of
Eastern
allegory
on
a
subsequent
occasion
,
that
she
was
"
getting
the
steam
up
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
,
Mrs
Raddle
,
"
said
Bob
Sawyer
,
with
all
imaginable
humility
,
"
but
the
fact
is
,
that
I
have
been
disappointed
in
the
City
to
-
day
.
"
<EOS>
---
Extraordinary
place
that
City
.
 
<EOS>
An
astonishing
number
of
men
always
ARE
getting
disappointed
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr
Sawyer
,
"
said
Mrs
Raddle
,
planting
herself
firmly
on
a
purple
cauliflower
in
the
Kidderminster
carpet
,
"
and
what
's
that
to
me
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
---
have
no
doubt
,
Mrs
Raddle
,
"
said
Bob
Sawyer
,
blinking
this
last
question
,
"
that
before
the
middle
of
next
week
we
shall
be
able
to
set
ourselves
quite
square
,
and
go
on
,
on
a
better
system
,
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
all
Mrs
Raddle
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
bustled
up
to
the
apartment
of
the
unlucky
Bob
Sawyer
,
so
bent
upon
going
into
a
passion
,
that
,
in
all
probability
,
payment
would
have
rather
disappointed
her
than
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
in
excellent
order
for
a
little
relaxation
of
the
kind
,
having
just
exchanged
a
few
introductory
compliments
with
Mr
R
in
the
front
kitchen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
suppose
,
Mr
Sawyer
,
"
said
Mrs
Raddle
,
elevating
her
voice
for
the
information
of
the
neighbours
---
"
<EOS>
do
you
suppose
that
I
'm
a
-
going
day
after
day
to
let
a
fellar
occupy
my
lodgings
as
never
thinks
of
paying
his
rent
,
nor
even
the
very
money
laid
out
for
the
fresh
butter
and
lump
sugar
that
's
bought
for
his
breakfast
,
and
the
very
milk
that
's
took
in

at

street
door

<EOS>
Do

working

has
lived
in
this
street
for
twenty
year
(
ten
year
over
the
way

and
nine
year
and
three

quarters
in
this
very
house
)
has
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
work
herself
to
death
after
a
parcel
of
lazy
idle
fellars
,
that
are
always
smoking
and
drinking
,
and
lounging
,
when
they
ought
to
be
glad
to
turn
their
hands
to
anything

to
pay
their
bills

Do

"
My
good

interposed
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
soothingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
the
goodness
to
keep
your
observashuns
to

<EOS>
Sir

I
beg

"
said
Mrs
Raddle
,
suddenly
arresting
the
rapid
torrent
of
her
speech
,
and
addressing
the
third
party
with
impressive
slowness
and
solemnity
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
aweer

Sir

that

any
right

I

<EOS>
"
No

did
not

said
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
good

responded
Mrs
Raddle
,
with
lofty
politeness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
p'raps

Sir

'll
confine

breaking
the
arms

legs
of

keep

be
some
persons
here

make

Sir

"
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
such
an
unreasonable
woman
,
"
remonstrated
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
parding
,
young
man
,
"
said
Mrs
Raddle
,
in
a
cold
perspiration
of
anger
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
will
you
have
the
goodness
just
to
call
me
that
again

sir

<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
make
use
of
the
word
in
any
invidious
sense

ma'am

replied
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
,
growing
somewhat
uneasy
on
his
own
account
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
parding
,
young
man
,
"
demanded
Mrs
Raddle
,
in
a
louder
and
more
imperative
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
who
do
you
call
a
woman

<EOS>
Did
you
make
that
remark
to
me

<EOS>
"
Why

bless
my
heart
!
"
said
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
apply
that
name
to
me
,
I
ask
of
you
,
sir

"
interrupted
Mrs
Raddle
,
with
intense
fierceness
,
throwing
the
door
wide
open
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
of
course
I
did
,
"
replied
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
of
course
you
did
,
"
said
Mrs
Raddle
,
backing
gradually
to
the
door
,
and
raising
her
voice
to
its
loudest
pitch
,
for
the
special
behoof
of
Mr
Raddle
in
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
of
course
you
did
!
 
<EOS>
And
everybody
knows
that
they
may
safely
insult
me
in
my
own
'
ouse
while
my
husband
sits
sleeping
downstairs
,
and
taking
no
more
notice
than
if
I
was
a
dog
in
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
He
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
(
here
Mrs
Raddle
sobbed
)
to
allow
his
wife
to
be
treated
in
this
way
by
a
parcel
of
young
cutters
and
carvers
of
live
people
's
bodies
,
that
disgraces
the
lodgings
(
another
sob
)
,
and
leaving
her
exposed
to
all
manner
of
abuse
;
a
base
,
faint
-
hearted
,
timorous
wretch
<EOS>
,
that
's
afraid
to
come
upstairs

and
face
the
ruffinly
creatures

that
's
afraid
<EOS>
---
that
's
afraid
to
come

"
<EOS>
Mrs
Raddle
paused
to
listen
whether
the
repetition
of
the
taunt
had
roused
her
better
half
;
and
finding
that
it
had
not
been
successful
,
proceeded
to
descend
the
stairs
with
sobs
innumerable
;
when
there
came
a
loud
double
knock
at
the
street
door
;
whereupon
she
burst
into
an
hysterical
fit
of
weeping
,
accompanied
with
dismal
moans
,
which
was
prolonged
until
the
knock
had
been
repeated
six
times
,
when
,
in
an
uncontrollable
burst
of
mental
agony
,
she
threw
down
all
the
umbrellas
,
and
disappeared
into
the
back
parlour
,
closing
the
door
after
her
with
an
awful
crash
.
   
<EOS>
"
Does
Mr
Sawyer
live
here
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
when
the
door
was
opened
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes

said
the
girl
,
"
first
floor

<EOS>
It
's
the
door
<EOS>
straight
afore
you

when
you
gets

the
top
of
the
stairs

"
 
<EOS>
Having
given
this
instruction
,
the
handmaid
,
who
had
been
brought
up
among
the
aboriginal
inhabitants
of
Southwark
,
disappeared
,
with
the
candle
in
her
hand
,
down
the
kitchen
stairs
,
perfectly
satisfied
that
she
had
done
everything
that
could
possibly
be
required
of
her
under
the
circumstances
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
,
who
entered
last
,
secured
the
street
door
,
after
several
ineffectual
efforts
,
by
putting
up
the
chain
;
and
the
friends
stumbled
upstairs
,
where
they
were
received
by
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
who
had
been
afraid
to
go
down
,
lest
he
should
be
waylaid
by
Mrs
Raddle
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
?
"
said
the
discomfited
student
.
 
<EOS>
"
Glad
to
see
you
 
---
take
care
of
the
glasses

"
 
<EOS>
This
caution
was
addressed
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
had
put
his
hat
in
the
tray
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
I
beg
your
pardon

<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
n't

mention
it

said
Bob
Sawyer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
rather
confined

a
young
bachelor

<EOS>
Walk
in

<EOS>
You
've
seen
this

before

<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
shook
hands
with
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
,
and
his
friends
followed
his
example
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
scarcely
taken
their
seats
when
there
was
another
double
knock
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
that
's
Jack
Hopkins
!
"
said
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush

<EOS>
Yes
,
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
Come
up

Jack

come
up

"
   
<EOS>
A
heavy
footstep
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
,
and
Jack
Hopkins
presented
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
wore
a
black
velvet
waistcoat
,
with
thunder
-
and
-
lightning
buttons
;
and
a
blue
striped
shirt
,
with
a
white
false
collar
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
late

said
Mr
Benjamin

<EOS>
"
Been

replied
Hopkins

<EOS>
"
Anything

No

nothing

Rather

ward

<EOS>
"
What
was
that

sir

"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Only

it

Do

recover

<EOS>
inquired
Mr

<EOS>
"
No

replied
Mr
Hopkins
carelessly

<EOS>
"
No

cake
---
exactly
two
minutes
after
it
was
all
over
,
boy
said
he
would
n't
lie
there
to
be
made
game
of
,
and
he
'd
tell
his
mother
if
they
did
n't
begin
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
astonished
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
nothing
,
that
ai
n't
,
"
said
Jack
Hopkins
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
,
Bob
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
at
all
,
"
replied
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
the
bye
,
Bob
,
"
said
Hopkins
,
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
glance
at
Mr
Pickwick
's
attentive
face
,
"
we
had
a
curious
accident
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
A
child
was
brought
in
,
who
had
swallowed
a
necklace
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Swallowed
what
,
Sir
?
"
interrupted
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
necklace
,
"
replied
Jack
Hopkins
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
all
at
once
,
you
know
,
that
would
be
too
much
<EOS>
---
you
could
n't
swallow
that
,
if
the
child
did
---
eh
,
Mr
Pickwick
?
<EOS>
ha
,
ha
!
"
<EOS>
Mr
Hopkins
appeared
highly
gratified
with
his
own
pleasantry
,
and
continued
---
"
No
,
the
way
was
this
.
 
<EOS>
Child
's
parents
were
poor
people
who
lived
in
a
court
.
<EOS>
Child
's
eldest
sister
bought
a
necklace
---
common
necklace
,
made
of
large
black
wooden
beads
.
 
<EOS>
Child
being
fond
of
toys
,
cribbed
the
necklace
,
hid
it
,
played
with
it
,
cut
the
string
,
and
swallowed
a
bead
.
 
<EOS>
Child
thought
it
capital
fun
,
went
back
next
day
,
and
swallowed
another
bead
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Bless
my
heart
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
what
a
dreadful
thing
!
 
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
Go
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Next
day
,
child
swallowed
two
beads
;
the
day
after
that
,
he
treated
himself
to
three
,
and
so
on
,
till
in
a
week
's
time
he
had
got
through
the
necklace
---
five
-
and
-
twenty
beads
in
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
sister
,
who
was
an
industrious
girl
,
and
seldom
treated
herself
to
a
bit
of
finery
,
cried
her
eyes
out
,
at
the
loss
of
the
necklace
;
looked
high
and
low
for
it
;
but
,
I
need
n't
say
,
did
n't
find
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
days
afterwards
,
the
family
were
at
dinner
---
baked
shoulder
of
mutton
,
and
potatoes
under
it
---
the
child
,
who
was
n't
hungry
,
was
playing
about
the
room
,
when
suddenly
there
was
heard
a
devil
of
a
noise
,
like
a
small
hailstorm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
do
that
,
my
boy
,
"
said
the
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
a
-
doin
'
nothing
,
"
said
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
do
n't
do
it
again
,
"
said
the
father
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
short
silence
,
and
then
the
noise
began
again
,
worse
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
mind
what
I
say
,
my
boy
,
"
said
the
father
,
"
you
'll
find
yourself
in
bed
,
in
something
less
than
a
pig
's
whisper
.
"
<EOS>
He
gave
the
child
a
shake
to
make
him
obedient
,
and
such
a
rattling
ensued
as
nobody
ever
heard
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
damme
,
it
's
IN
the
child
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
father
,
"
he
's
got
the
croup
in
the
wrong
place
!
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
have
n't
,
father
,
"
said
the
child
,
beginning
to
cry
<EOS>
,
"
it
's
the
necklace
;
I
swallowed
it
,
father
.
"
<EOS>
---
The
father
caught
the
child
up
,
and
ran
with
him
to
the
hospital
;
the
beads
in
the
boy
's
stomach
rattling
all
the
way
with
the
jolting
;
and
the
people
looking
up
in
the
air
,
and
down
in
the
cellars
,
to
see
where
the
unusual
sound
came
from
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
in
the
hospital
now
,
"
said
Jack
Hopkins
,
"
and
he
makes
such
a
devil
of
a
noise
when
he
walks
about
,
that
they
're
obliged
to
muffle
him
in
a
watchman
's
coat
,
for
fear
he
should
wake
the
patients
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
most
extraordinary
case
I
ever
heard
of
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
an
emphatic
blow
on
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
's
nothing
,
"
said
Jack
Hopkins
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
,
Bob
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
singular
things
occur
in
our
profession
,
I
can
assure
you
,
Sir
,
"
said
Hopkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
I
should
be
disposed
to
imagine
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
Another
knock
at
the
door
announced
a
large
-
headed
young
man
in
a
black
wig
,
who
brought
with
him
a
scorbutic
youth
in
a
long
stock
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
comer
was
a
gentleman
in
a
shirt
emblazoned
with
pink
anchors
,
who
was
closely
followed
by
a
pale
youth
with
a
plated
watchguard
.
 
<EOS>
The
arrival
of
a
prim
personage
in
clean
linen
and
cloth
boots
rendered
the
party
complete
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
table
with
the
green
baize
cover
was
wheeled
out
;
the
first
instalment
of
punch
was
brought
in
,
in
a
white
jug
;
and
the
succeeding
three
hours
were
devoted
to
VINGT
-
ET
-
UN
at
sixpence
a
dozen
,
which
was
only
once
interrupted
by
a
slight
dispute
between
the
scorbutic
youth
and
the
gentleman
with
the
pink
anchors
;
in
the
course
of
which
,
the
scorbutic
youth
intimated
a
burning
desire
to
pull
the
nose
of
the
gentleman
with
the
emblems
of
hope
;
in
reply
to
which
,
that
individual
expressed
his
decided
unwillingness
to
accept
of
any
"
sauce
"
on
gratuitous
terms
,
either
from
the
irascible
young
gentleman
with
the
scorbutic
countenance
,
or
any
other
person
who
was
ornamented
with
a
head
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
last
"
natural
"
had
been
declared
,
and
the
profit
and
loss
account
of
fish
and
sixpences
adjusted
,
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
,
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
rang
for
supper
,
and
the
visitors
squeezed
themselves
into
corners
while
it
was
getting
ready
.
   
<EOS>
it
was
not
so
easily
got
ready
as
some
people
may
imagine
.
<EOS>
First
of
all
,
it
was
necessary
to
awaken
the
girl
,
who
had
fallen
asleep
with
her
face
on
the
kitchen
table
;
this
took
a
little
time
,
and
,
even
when
she
did
answer
the
bell
,
another
quarter
of
an
hour
was
consumed
in
fruitless
endeavours
to
impart
to
her
a
faint
and
distant
glimmering
of
reason
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
to
whom
the
order
for
the
oysters
had
been
sent
,
had
not
been
told
to
open
them
;
it
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
open
an
oyster
with
a
limp
knife
and
a
two
-
pronged
fork
;
and
very
little
was
done
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
Very
little
of
the
beef
was
done
either
;
and
the
ham
(
which
was
also
from
the
German
-
sausage
shop
round
the
corner
)
<EOS>
was
in
a
similar
predicament
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
there
was
plenty
of
porter
in
a
tin
can
;
and
the
cheese
went
a
great
way
,
for
it
was
very
strong
.
<EOS>
So
upon
the
whole
,
perhaps
,
the
supper
was
quite
as
good
as
such
matters
usually
are
.
   
<EOS>
After
supper
,
another
jug
of
punch
was
put
upon
the
table
,
together
with
a
paper
of
cigars
,
and
a
couple
of
bottles
of
spirits
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
an
awful
pause
;
and
this
awful
pause
was
occasioned
by
a
very
common
occurrence
in
this
sort
of
place
,
but
a
very
embarrassing
one
notwithstanding
.
   
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
the
girl
was
washing
the
glasses
.
 
<EOS>
The
establishment
boasted
four
:
<EOS>
we
do
not
record
the
circumstance
as
at
all
derogatory
to
Mrs
Raddle
,
for
there
never
was
a
lodging
-
house
yet
,
that
was
not
short
of
glasses
.
 
<EOS>
The
landlady
's
glasses
were
little
,
thin
,
blown
-
glass
tumblers
,
and
those
which
had
been
borrowed
from
the
public
-
house
were
great
,
dropsical
,
bloated
articles
,
each
supported
on
a
huge
gouty
leg
.
 
<EOS>
This
would
have
been
in
itself
sufficient
to
have
possessed
the
company
with
the
real
state
of
affairs
;
but
the
young
woman
of
all
work
had
prevented
the
possibility
of
any
misconception
arising
in
the
mind
of
any
gentleman
upon
the
subject
,
by
forcibly
dragging
every
man
's
glass
away
,
long
before
he
had
finished
his
beer
,
and
audibly
stating
,
despite
the
winks
and
interruptions
of
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
that
it
was
to
be
conveyed
downstairs
,
and
washed
forthwith
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
a
very
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
any
good
.
 
<EOS>
The
prim
man
in
the
cloth
boots
,
who
had
been
unsuccessfully
attempting
to
make
a
joke
during
the
whole
time
the
round
game
lasted
,
saw
his
opportunity
,
and
availed
himself
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
instant
the
glasses
disappeared
<EOS>
,
he
commenced
a
long
story
about
a
great
public
character
,
whose
name
he
had
forgotten
,
making
a
particularly
happy
reply
to
another
eminent
and
illustrious
individual
whom
he
had
never
been
able
to
identify
.
 
<EOS>
He
enlarged
at
some
length
and
with
great
minuteness
upon
divers
collateral
circumstances
,
distantly
connected
with
the
anecdote
in
hand
,
but
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
n't
recollect
at
that
precise
moment
what
the
anecdote
was
,
although
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
telling
the
story
with
great
applause
for
the
last
ten
years
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
"
said
the
prim
man
in
the
cloth
boots
,
"
it
is
a
very
extraordinary
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
you
have
forgotten
it
,
"
said
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
glancing
eagerly
at
the
door
,
as
he
thought
he
heard
the
noise
of
glasses
jingling
;
"
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
am
I
,
"
responded
the
prim
man
,
"
because
I
know
it
would
have
afforded
so
much
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
;
I
dare
say
I
shall
manage
to
recollect
it
,
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
or
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
prim
man
arrived
at
this
point
just
as
the
glasses
came
back
,
when
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
who
had
been
absorbed
in
attention
during
the
whole
time
,
said
he
should
very
much
like
to
hear
the
end
of
it
,
for
,
so
far
as
it
went
,
it
was
,
without
exception
,
the
very
best
story
he
had
ever
heard
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
the
tumblers
restored
Bob
Sawyer
to
a
degree
of
equanimity
which
he
had
not
possessed
since
his
interview
with
his
landlady
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
brightened
up
,
and
he
began
to
feel
quite
convivial
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Betsy
,
"
said
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
with
great
suavity
,
and
dispersing
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
tumultuous
little
mob
of
glasses
the
girl
had
collected
in
the
centre
of
the
table
---
"
now
,
Betsy
,
the
warm
water
;
be
brisk
,
there
's
a
good
girl
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
have
no
warm
water
,
"
replied
Betsy
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
warm
water
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
girl
,
with
a
shake
of
the
head
which
expressed
a
more
decided
negative
than
the
most
copious
language
could
have
conveyed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Missis
Raddle
said
you
warn't
to
have
none
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
surprise
depicted
on
the
countenances
of
his
guests
imparted
new
courage
to
the
host
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bring
up
the
warm
water
instantly
---
instantly
!
"
said
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
with
desperate
sternness
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
,
"
replied
the
girl
;
"
Missis
Raddle
raked
out
the
kitchen
fire
<EOS>
afore
<EOS>
she
went
to
bed
,
and
locked
up
the
kittle
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
never
mind
;
never
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
disturb
yourself
about
such
a
trifle
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
observing
the
conflict
of
Bob
Sawyer
's
passions
,
as
depicted
in
his
countenance
,
"
cold
water
will
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
admirably
,
"
said
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
landlady
is
subject
to
some
slight
attacks
of
mental
derangement
,
"
remarked
Bob
Sawyer
,
with
a
ghastly
smile
;
"
I
fear
I
must
give
her
warning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
do
n't
,
"
said
Ben
Allen
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
must
,
"
said
Bob
,
with
heroic
firmness
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
pay
her
what
I
owe
her
,
and
give
her
warning
to
-
morrow
morning
.
"
 
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
how
devoutly
he
wished
he
could
!
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
's
heart
-
sickening
attempts
to
rally
under
this
last
blow
,
communicated
a
dispiriting
influence
to
the
company
,
the
greater
part
of
whom
,
with
the
view
of
raising
their
spirits
,
attached
themselves
with
extra
cordiality
to
the
cold
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
the
first
perceptible
effects
of
which
were
displayed
in
a
renewal
of
hostilities
between
the
scorbutic
youth
and
the
gentleman
in
the
shirt
.
 
<EOS>
The
belligerents
vented
their
feelings
of
mutual
contempt
,
for
some
time
,
in
a
variety
of
frownings
and
snortings
,
until
at
last
the
scorbutic
youth
felt
it
necessary
to
come
to
a
more
explicit
understanding
on
the
matter
;
when
the
following
clear
understanding
took
place
.
<EOS>
"
Sawyer
,
"
said
the
scorbutic
youth
,
in
a
loud
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Noddy
,
"
replied
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
sorry
,
Sawyer
,
"
said
Mr
Noddy
,
"
to
create
any
unpleasantness
at
any
friend
's
table
,
and
much
less
at
yours

Sawyer
---
very

but
I
must
take
this
opportunity
of
informing
Mr
Gunter
that
he
is
no
gentleman

And
I
should
be
very
sorry
,
Sawyer
,
to
create
any
disturbance
in
the
street
in
which
you
reside
,
"
said
Mr
Gunter
,
"
but
I
'm
afraid
I
shall
be
under
the
necessity
of
alarming
the
neighbours
by
throwing
the
person
who
has
just
spoken
,
out
o
'
window
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
that
,
sir
?
"
inquired
Mr
Noddy
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
I
say
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Gunter
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see
you
do
it
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Noddy
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
FEEL
me
<EOS>
do
it
in
half
a
minute
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Gunter
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
request
that
you
'll
favour
me
with
your
card
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Noddy
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
do
nothing
of
the
kind
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Gunter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
,
Sir
?
"
inquired
Mr
Noddy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Because
you
'll
stick
it
up
over
your
chimney
-
piece
,
and
delude
your
visitors
into
the
false
belief
that
a
gentleman
has
been
to
see
you
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Gunter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
a
friend
of
mine
shall
wait
on
you
in
the
morning
,
"
said
Mr
Noddy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
'm
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
caution
,
and
I
'll
leave
particular
directions
with
the
servant
to
lock
up
the
spoons
,
"
replied
Mr
Gunter
.
   
<EOS>
At
this
point
the
remainder
of
the
guests
interposed
,
and
remonstrated
with
both
parties
on
the
impropriety
of
their
conduct
;
on
which
Mr
Noddy
begged
to
state
that
his
father
was
quite
as
respectable
as
Mr
Gunter
's
father
;
to
which
Mr
Gunter
replied
that
his
father
was
to
the
full
as
respectable
as
Mr
Noddy
's
father
,
and
that
his
father
's
son
was
as
good
a
man
as
Mr
Noddy
,
any
day
in
the
week
.
 
<EOS>
As
this
announcement
seemed
the
prelude
to
a
recommencement
of
the
dispute
,
there
was
another
interference
on
the
part
of
the
company
;
and
a
vast
quantity
of
talking
and
clamouring
ensued
,
in
the
course
of
which
Mr
Noddy
gradually
allowed
his
feelings
to
overpower
him
,
and
professed
that
he
had
ever
entertained
a
devoted
personal
attachment
towards
Mr
Gunter
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
Mr
Gunter
replied
that
,
upon
the
whole
,
he
rather
preferred
Mr
Noddy
to
his
own
brother
;
on
hearing
which
admission
,
Mr
Noddy
magnanimously
rose
from
his
seat
,
and
proffered
his
hand
to
Mr
Gunter
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gunter
grasped
it
with
affecting
fervour
;
and
everybody
said
that
the
whole
dispute
had
been
conducted
in
a
manner
which
was
highly
honourable
to
both
parties
concerned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Jack
Hopkins
,
"
just
to
set
us
going
again
,
Bob
,
I
do
n't
mind
singing
a
song
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
Hopkins
,
incited
thereto
by
tumultuous
applause
,
plunged
himself
at
once
into
"
The
King
,
God
bless
him
,
"
which
he
sang
as
loud
as
he
could
,
to
a
novel
air
,
compounded
of
the
"
Bay
of
Biscay
,
"
and
"
A
Frog
he
would
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
chorus
was
the
essence
of
the
song
;
and
,
as
each
gentleman
sang
it
to
the
tune
he
knew
best
,
the
effect
was
very
striking
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
at
the
end
of
the
chorus
to
the
first
verse
,
that
Mr
Pickwick
held
up
his
hand
in
a
listening
attitude
,
and
said
,
as
soon
as
silence
was
restored
---
   
"
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
heard
somebody
calling
from
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
A
profound
silence
immediately
ensued
;
and
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
was
observed
to
turn
pale
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
hear
it
now
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
the
goodness
to
open
the
door
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
door
was
no
sooner
opened
than
all
doubt
on
the
subject
was
removed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Sawyer
!
<EOS>
Mr
Sawyer
!
"
screamed
a
voice
from
the
two
-
pair
landing
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
landlady
,
"
said
Bob
Sawyer
,
looking
round
him
with
great
dismay
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mrs
Raddle
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
this
,
Mr
Sawyer
?
"
replied
the
voice
,
with
great
shrillness
and
rapidity
of
utterance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ai
n't
it
enough
to
be
swindled
out
of
one
's
rent
,
and
money
lent
out
of
pocket
besides
,
and
abused
and
insulted
by
your
friends
that
dares
to
call
themselves
men
,
without
having
the
house
turned
out
of
the
window
,
and
noise
enough
made
to
bring
the
fire
-
engines
here
,
at
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
?
<EOS>
---
Turn
them
wretches
away
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourselves
,
"
said
the
voice
of
Mr
Raddle
,
which
appeared
to
proceed
from
beneath
some
distant
bed
-
clothes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ashamed
of
themselves
!
"
said
Mrs
Raddle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
go
down
and
knock
'em
every
one
downstairs
?
 
<EOS>
You
would
if
you
was
a
man
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
should
if
I
was
a
dozen
men
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
Mr
Raddle
pacifically
,
"
but
they
have
the
advantage
of
me
in
numbers
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ugh
,
you
coward
!
"
replied
Mrs
Raddle
,
with
supreme
contempt
.
<EOS>
"
DO
you
mean
to
turn
them
wretches
out
,
or
not
,
Mr
Sawyer
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
're
going
,
<EOS>
Mrs
Raddle
,
they
're
going
,
"
said
the
miserable
Bob
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
you
'd
better
go
,
"
said
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
to
his
friends
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
were
making
too
much
noise
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
very
unfortunate
thing
,
"
said
the
prim
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Just
as
we
were
getting
so
comfortable
too
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
prim
man
was
just
beginning
to
have
a
dawning
recollection
of
the
story
he
had
forgotten
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
hardly
to
be
borne
,
"
said
the
prim
man
,
looking
round
.
<EOS>
"
Hardly
to
be
borne
,
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
to
be
endured
,
"
replied
Jack
Hopkins
;
"
let
's
have
the
other
verse
,
Bob
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
here
goes
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
Jack
,
do
n't
,
"
interposed
Bob
Sawyer
;
"
it
's
a
capital
song
,
but
I
am
afraid
we
had
better
not
have
the
other
verse
.
<EOS>
They
are
very
violent
people
,
the
people
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
step
upstairs
,
and
pitch
into
the
landlord
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Hopkins
,
"
or
keep
on
ringing
the
bell
,
or
go
and
groan
on
the
staircase
?
 
<EOS>
You
may
command
me
,
Bob
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
much
indebted
to
you
for
your
friendship
and
good
-
nature
,
Hopkins
,
"
said
the
wretched
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
"
but
I
think
the
best
plan
to
avoid
any
further
dispute
is
for
us
to
break
up
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr
Sawyer
,
"
screamed
the
shrill
voice
of
Mrs
Raddle
,
"
are
them
brutes
going
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
're
only
looking
for
their
hats
,
Mrs
Raddle
,
"
said
Bob
;
"
they
are
going
directly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Going
!
"
said
Mrs
Raddle
,
thrusting
her
nightcap
over
the
banisters
just
as
Mr
Pickwick
,
followed
by
Mr
Tupman
,
emerged
from
the
sitting
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
Going
!
<EOS>
what
did
they
ever
come
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
ma'am
,
"
remonstrated
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Get
along
with
you
,
old
wretch
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Mrs
Raddle
,
hastily
withdrawing
the
nightcap
.
 
<EOS>
"
Old
enough
to
be
his
grandfather
,
you
willin
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
worse
than
any
of
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
found
it
in
vain
to
protest
his
innocence
,
so
hurried
downstairs
into
the
street
,
whither
he
was
closely
followed
by
Mr
Tupman
,
Mr
Winkle
,
and
Mr
Snodgrass
.
<EOS>
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
who
was
dismally
depressed
with
spirits
and
agitation
,
accompanied
them
as
far
as
London
Bridge
,
and
in
the
course
of
the
walk
confided
to
Mr
Winkle
,
as
an
especially
eligible
person
to
intrust
the
secret
to
,
that
he
was
resolved
to
cut
the
throat
of
any
gentleman
,
except
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
who
should
aspire
to
the
affections
of
his
sister
Arabella
.
 
<EOS>
Having
expressed
his
determination
to
perform
this
painful
duty
of
a
brother
with
proper
firmness
,
he
burst
into
tears
,
knocked
his
hat
over
his
eyes
,
and
,
making
the
best
of
his
way
back
,
knocked
double
knocks
at
the
door
of
the
Borough
Market
office
,
and
took
short
naps
on
the
steps
alternately
,
until
daybreak
,
under
the
firm
impression
that
he
lived
there
,
and
had
forgotten
the
key
.
   
<EOS>
The
visitors
having
all
departed
,
in
compliance
with
the
rather
pressing
request
of
Mrs
Raddle
,
the
luckless
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
was
left
alone
,
to
meditate
on
the
probable
events
of
to

morrow
,
and
the
pleasures
of
the

Chapter
33
.
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
the
elder
delivers
some
critical
sentiments
respecting
literary
composition
;
and
,
assisted
by
his
son
Samuel
,
pays
a
small
instalment
of
retaliation
to
the
account
of
the
reverend
gentleman
with
the
red
nose
 
<EOS>
The
morning
of
the
thirteenth
of
February
,
which
the
readers
of
this
authentic
narrative
know
,
as
well
as
we
do
,
to
have
been
the
day
immediately
preceding
that
which
was
appointed
for
the
trial
of
Mrs
Bardell
's
action
,
was
a
busy
time
for
Mr
Samuel
Weller
,
who
was
perpetually
engaged
in
travelling
from
the
George
and
Vulture
to
Mr
Perker
's
chambers
and
back
again
,
from
and
between
the
hours
of
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
two
in
the
afternoon
,
both
inclusive
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
there
was
anything
whatever
to
be
done
,
for
the
consultation
had
taken
place
,
and
the
course
of
proceeding
to
be
adopted
,
had
been
finally
determined
on
;
but
Mr
Pickwick
being
in
a
most
extreme
state
of
excitement
,
persevered
in
constantly
sending
small
notes
to
his
attorney
,
merely
containing
the
inquiry
,
"
Dear
Perker
.
 
<EOS>
Is
all
going
on
well
?
"
<EOS>
to
which
Mr
Perker
invariably
forwarded
the
reply
,
"
Dear
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
As
well
as
possible
"
;
the
fact
being
,
as
we
have
already
hinted
,
that
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
go
on
,
<EOS>
either
well
or
ill
,
until
the
sitting
of
the
court
on
the
following
morning
.
   
<EOS>
But
people
who
go
voluntarily
to
law
,
or
are
taken
forcibly
there
,
for
the
first
time
,
may
be
allowed
to
labour
under
some
temporary
irritation
and
anxiety
;
and
Sam
,
with
a
due
allowance
for
the
frailties
of
human
nature
,
obeyed
all
his
master
's
behests
with
that
imperturbable
good
-
humour
and
unruffable
composure
which
formed
one
of
his
most
striking
and
amiable
characteristics
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
had
solaced
himself
with
a
most
agreeable
little
dinner
,
and
was
waiting
at
the
bar
for
the
glass
of
warm
mixture
in
which
Mr
Pickwick
had
requested
him
to
drown
the
fatigues
of
his
morning
's
walks
,
when
a
young
boy
of
about
three
feet
high
,
or
thereabouts
,
in
a
hairy
cap
and
fustian
overalls
,
whose
garb
bespoke
a
laudable
ambition
to
attain
in
time
the
elevation
of
an
hostler
,
entered
the
passage
of
the
George
and
Vulture
,
and
looked
first
up
the
stairs
,
and
then
along
the
passage
,
and
then
into
the
bar
,
as
if
in
search
of
somebody
to
whom
he
bore
a
commission
;
whereupon
the
barmaid
,
conceiving
it
not
improbable
that
the
said
commission
might
be
directed
to
the
tea
or
table
spoons
of
the
establishment
,
accosted
the
boy
with
---
   
"
<EOS>
Now
,
young
man
,
what
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anybody
here
,
named
Sam
?
"
inquired
the
youth
,
in
a
loud
voice
of
treble
quality
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
t'other
name
?
"
said
Sam
Weller
,
looking
round
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
know
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
briskly
replied
the
young
gentleman
below
the
hairy
cap
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
sharp
boy
,
you
are
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
;
"
<EOS>
only
I
would
n't
show
that
wery
fine
edge
too
much

if
I
was
you

anybody
took
it
off

What
do
you
mean

comin

<EOS>
"
'Cos
an

replied
the
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
old
gen'l'm'n

"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
,
with
deep
disdain
.
   
<EOS>
"
Him
as
drives
a
Ipswich
coach
,
and
uses
our
parlour
,
"
rejoined
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
told
me
yesterday
mornin
'
to
come
to
the
George
and
Wultur
this
arternoon

ask

Sam

"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
father

said
Mr
Weller
,
turning
with
an
explanatory
air
to
the
young
lady
in
the
bar
;
"
blessed
if
I
think
he
hardly
knows
wot
my
other
name

<EOS>
Well

<EOS>
"
Why

said
the

,
"
you

replied
Sam
.
<EOS>
And
thus
empowered
,
the
young
gentleman
walked
away
,
awakening
all
the
echoes
in
George
Yard
as
he
did
so
,
with
several
chaste
and
extremely
correct
imitations
of
a
drover
's
whistle
,
delivered
in
a
tone
of
peculiar
richness
and
volume
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
having
obtained
leave
of
absence
from
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
,
in
his
then
state
of
excitement
and
worry
,
was
by
no
means
displeased
at
being
left
alone
,
set
forth
,
long
before
the
appointed
hour
,
and
having
plenty
of
time
at
his
disposal
,
sauntered
down
as
far
as
the
Mansion
House
,
where
he
paused
and
contemplated
,
with
a
face
of
great
calmness
and
philosophy
,
the
numerous
cads
and
drivers
of
short
stages
who
assemble
near
that
famous
place
of
resort
,
to
the
great
terror
and
confusion
of
the
old
-
lady
population
of
these
realms
.
 
<EOS>
Having
loitered
here
,
for
half
an
hour
or
so
,
Mr
Weller
turned
,
and
began
wending
his
way
towards
Leadenhall
Market
,
through
a
variety
of
by
-
streets
and
courts
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
was
sauntering
away
his
spare
time
,
and
stopped
to
look
at
almost
every
object
that
met
his
gaze
,
it
is
by
no
means
surprising
that
Mr
Weller
should
have
paused
before
a
small
stationer
's
and
print
-
seller
's
window
;
but
without
further
explanation
it
does
appear
surprising
that
his
eyes
should
have
no
sooner
rested
on
certain
pictures
which
were
exposed
for
sale
therein
,
than
he
gave
a
sudden
start
,
smote
his
right
leg
with
great
vehemence
,
and
exclaimed
,
with
energy
,
"
if
it
had
n't
been
for
this
,
I
should
ha
'
forgot
all
about
it
,
till
it
was
too
late
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
particular
picture
on
which
Sam
Weller
's
eyes
were
fixed
,
as
he
said
this
,
was
a
highly
-
coloured
representation
of
a
couple
of
human
hearts
skewered
together
with
an
arrow
,
cooking
before
a
cheerful
fire
,
while
a
male
and
female
cannibal
in
modern
attire
,
the
gentleman
being
clad
in
a
blue
coat
and
white
trousers
,
and
the
lady
in
a
deep
red
pelisse
with
a
parasol
of
the
same
,
were
approaching
the
meal
with
hungry
eyes
,
up
a
serpentine
gravel
path
leading
thereunto
.
 
<EOS>
A
decidedly
indelicate
young
gentleman
,
in
a
pair
of
wings
and
nothing
else
,
was
depicted
as
superintending
the
cooking
;
a
representation
of
the
spire
of
the
church
in
Langham
Place
,
London
,
appeared
in
the
distance
;
and
the
whole
formed
a
"
valentine
,
"
of
which
,
as
a
written
inscription
in
the
window
testified
,
there
was
a
large
assortment
within
,
which
the
shopkeeper
pledged
himself
to
dispose
of
,
to
his
countrymen
generally
,
at
the
reduced
rate
of
one
-
and
-
sixpence
each
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
ha
'
forgot
it
;
I
should
certainly
ha
'
forgot
it
!
"
<EOS>
said
Sam
;
<EOS>
so
saying
,
he
at
once
stepped
into
the
stationer
's
shop
,
and
requested
to
be
served
with
a
sheet
of
the
best
gilt
-
edged
letter
-
paper
,
and
a
hard
-
nibbed
pen
which
could
be
warranted
not
to
splutter
.
 
<EOS>
These
articles
having
been
promptly
supplied
,
he
walked
on
direct
towards
Leadenhall
Market
at
a
good
round
pace
,
very
different
from
his
recent
lingering
one
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
round
him
,
he
there
beheld
a
signboard
on
which
the
painter
's
art
had
delineated
something
remotely
resembling
a
cerulean
elephant
with
an
aquiline
nose
in
lieu
of
trunk
.
 
<EOS>
Rightly
conjecturing
that
this
was
the
Blue
Boar
himself
,
he
stepped
into
the
house
,
and
inquired
concerning
his
parent
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
wo
n't
be
here
this
three
-
quarters
of
an
hour
or
more
,
"
said
the
young
lady
who
superintended
the
domestic
arrangements
of
the
Blue
Boar
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wery
good
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
have
nine
-
penn'oth
o
'
brandy
-
and
-
water
luke
,
and
the
inkstand
,
will
you
,
miss
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
brandy
-
and
-
water
luke
,
and
the
inkstand
,
having
been
carried
into
the
little
parlour
,
and
the
young
lady
having
carefully
flattened
down
the
coals
to
prevent
their
blazing
,
and
carried
away
the
poker
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
the
fire
being
stirred
,
without
the
full
privity
and
concurrence
of
the
Blue
Boar
being
first
had
and
obtained
,
Sam
Weller
sat
himself
down
in
a
box
near
the
stove
,
and
pulled
out
the
sheet
of
gilt
-
edged
letter
-
paper
,
and
the
hard
-
nibbed
pen
.
 
<EOS>
Then
looking
carefully
at
the
pen
to
see
that
there
were
no
hairs
in
it
,
and
dusting
down
the
table
,
so
that
there
might
be
no
crumbs
of
bread
under
the
paper
,
Sam
tucked
up
the
cuffs
of
his
coat
,
squared
his
elbows
,
and
composed
himself
to
write
.
   
<EOS>
To
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
are
not
in
the
habit
of
devoting
themselves
practically
to
the
science
of
penmanship
,
writing
a
letter
is
no
very
easy
task
;
it
being
always
considered
necessary
in
such
cases
for
the
writer
to
recline
his
head
on
his
left
arm
,
so
as
to
place
his
eyes
as
nearly
as
possible
on
a
level
with
the
paper
,
and
,
while
glancing
sideways
at
the
letters
he
is
constructing
,
to
form
with
his
tongue
imaginary
characters
to
correspond
.
 
<EOS>
These
motions
,
although
unquestionably
of
the
greatest
assistance
to
original
composition
,
retard
in
some
degree
the
progress
of
the
writer
;
and
Sam
had
unconsciously
been
a
full
hour
and
a
half
writing
words
in
small
text
,
smearing
out
wrong
letters
with
his
little
finger
,
and
putting
in
new
ones
which
required
going
over
very
often
to
render
them
visible
through
the
old
blots
,
when
he
was
roused
by
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
entrance
of
his
parent
.
   
<EOS>
"

said
the

<EOS>
"

responded
the

laying
down
his

exclaimed
Mr

apparently
horror

by

<EOS>
These
reflections
were
too
much
for
the
good
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
raised
Sam
's
tumbler
to
his
lips
and
drank
off
its
contents

"

<EOS>
We
can
not
distinctly
say
whether
it
was
the
prospect
of
the
pipe
,
or
the
consolatory
reflection
that
a
fatal
disposition
to
get
married
ran
in
the
family
,
and
could
n't
be
helped
,
which
calmed
Mr
Weller
's
feelings
,
and
caused
his
grief
to
subside
.
 
<EOS>
We
should
be
rather
disposed
to
say
that
the
result
was
attained
by
combining
the
two
sources
of
consolation
,
for
he
repeated
the
second
in
a
low
tone
,
very
frequently
;
ringing
the
bell
meanwhile
,
to
order
in
the
first

He
then
divested
himself
of
his
upper
coat
;
and
lighting
the
pipe
and
placing
himself
in
front
of
the
fire
with
his
back
towards
it
,
so
that
he
could
feel
its
full
heat
,
and
recline
against
the
mantel
-
piece
at
the
same
time
,
turned
towards
Sam
,
and
,
with
a
countenance
greatly
mollified
by
the
softening
influence
of
tobacco
,
requested
him
to
"

<EOS>
Sam
dipped
his
pen
into
the
ink
to
be
ready
for
any
corrections

began
with
a
very
theatrical
air

Mr

scratching

Wot

that

"

Ah

what

"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
might
jist
as
well
call

a
griffin

or
a

a

which

wery
well

a
collection

fabulous
animals

added
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Just
as
well
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Drive
on
,
Sammy
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
complied
with
the
request
,
and
proceeded
as
follows
;
his
father
continuing
to
smoke
,
with
a
mixed
expression
of
wisdom
and
complacency
,
which
was
particularly
edifying
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Afore
I
see
you
,
I
thought
all
women
was
alike
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
So
they
are
,
"
observed
the
elder
Mr
Weller
parenthetically
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
But
now
,
"
"
continued
Sam
,
"
"
now
I
find
what
a
reg'lar
soft

headed

inkred'lous

I
must

I

it

said
Sam
,
looking
up
.
   
<EOS>
Mr

nodded
approvingly
,
and
Sam
resumed
.
   
<EOS>
"

So
I
take
the

dubiously

<EOS>
No

it

Sam
,
reading
on
very
quickly
,
to
avoid
contesting
the
point

"
<EOS>
"
Except
of
me
Mary

your

over

My

will
now
conclude

<EOS>
"
That
's
all
,

Sam

<EOS>
"
That
's
rather
a
Sudden

up

ai

it

"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr

.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a

on

said
Sam
;
"
she
'll
vish

that
's
the
great

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr

"
there
's
somethin'
in

I

"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
difficulty

Sam
;
"
I
do

to

<EOS>

said
the

proprietor
of
that

.
   
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
do

"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never

<EOS>
"
Sign
it

Pickwick

"
then
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
;
"
it
's
a
wery
good
name
,
and
a
easy
one
to
spell
.
"
<EOS>
"
The
wery
thing
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
COULD
end
with
a
werse
;
what
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
it

Sam
,

rejoined
Mr

.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
know'd
a
respectable
coachman
as
wrote

cept
one
,
as
made
<EOS>
an
affectin
'

<EOS>
the
night
afore
<EOS>
he
was
hung
for
a
highway
robbery
;
and
he
wos
only
a
Cambervell
man
,
so
even
that
's
no
rule
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
Sam
was
not
to
be
dissuaded
from
the
poetical
idea
that
had
occurred
to
him
,
so
he
signed
the
letter
---
     
<EOS>
"
Your
love
-
sick
    
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
And
having
folded
it
,
in
a
very
intricate
manner
,
squeezed
a
downhill
direction
in
one
corner
:
"
To
Mary
,
Housemaid
,
at
Mr
Nupkins
's
,
Mayor
's
,
Ipswich
,
Suffolk
"
;
and
put
it
into
his
pocket
,
wafered
,
and
ready
for
the
general
post
.
 
<EOS>
This
important
business
having
been
transacted
,
Mr
Weller
the
elder
proceeded
to
open
that
,
on
which
he
had
summoned
his
son
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
first
matter
relates
to
your
governor
,
Sammy
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
-
goin
'
to
be
tried
to

morrow
,
ai
n't
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
trial
's
a
-
comin
'
on
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
"
Now
I
s'pose
he
'll
want
to
call
some
witnesses
to
speak
to
his
character
,
or
p'rhaps
to
prove
a
alleybi
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
a

turnin
'
the
bis'ness
over
in
my

,
and
he
may
make
his

self
easy
,
Sammy

<EOS>
I
've
got
some
friends
<EOS>
as'll
do
either
for
him
,
but
my
adwice
'
ud
be
this
here
---
<EOS>
never
mind
the
character
,
and
stick
to
the
alleybi
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
like
a
alleybi
,
Sammy
,
nothing
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
looked
very
profound
as
he
delivered
this
legal
opinion
;
and
burying
his
nose
in
his
tumbler
,
winked
over
the
top
thereof
,
at
his
astonished
son
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
do
you
mean
?
"
said
Sam
;
<EOS>
"
you
do
n't
think
he
's
<EOS>
a
-
goin
'
to
be
tried
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
do
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
ai
n't
no
part
of
the
present
consideration
,
Sammy
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
Verever
he
's
a
-
goin
'
to
be
tried
,
my
boy
,
a
alleybi
's
the
thing
to
get
him
off
.
 
<EOS>
Ve
got
Tom
Vildspark
off
that
'
ere
manslaughter
,
with
a
alleybi
,
<EOS>
ven
all
the
big
vigs
to
a
man
<EOS>
said
as
nothing
could
n't
save
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
"
pinion
is
,
Sammy
,
that
if
your
governor
do
n't
prove
a
alleybi
,
he
'll
be
what
the
Italians
call
reg'larly
flummoxed
,
and
that
's
all
about
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
elder
Mr
Weller
entertained
a
firm
and
unalterable
conviction
that
the
Old
Bailey
was
the
supreme
court
of
judicature
in
this
country
,
and
that
its
rules
and
forms
of
proceeding
regulated
and
controlled
the
practice
of
all
other
courts
of
justice
whatsoever
,
he
totally
disregarded
the
assurances
and
arguments
of
his
son
,
tending
to
show
that
the
alibi
was
inadmissible
;
and
vehemently
protested
that
Mr
Pickwick
was
being
"
wictimised
.
<EOS>
"
Finding
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
discuss
the
matter
further
,
Sam
changed
the
subject
,
and
inquired
what
the
second
topic
was
,
on
which
his
revered
parent
wished
to
consult
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
pint
o
'
domestic
policy
,
Sammy
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
<EOS>
"
This
here
Stiggins
---
"
   
"
Red
-
nosed
man

"
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
wery
same
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
here
red

so

if
I

"
interposed
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
minute
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
;
"
I
wos
a
-
going
to
say
,
he
always
brings
now

a

said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Clean

"
replied
Mr
Weller
;
"
never
leaves
nothin'
in
it
<EOS>
but
the
cork
and
the
smell

trust
him
for
that

Sammy

<EOS>
Now
,
these
here

<EOS>
I
,
Sammy
<EOS>
---
I
've
got
the
two
tickets
as

sent
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
communicated
this
secret
with
great
glee
,
and
winked
so
indefatigably
after
doing
so
,
that
Sam
began
to
think
he
must
have
got
the
TIC
DOLOUREUX
in
his
right
eyelid
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
"
said
that
young
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
continued
his
progenitor
,
looking
round
him
very
cautiously
,
"
you
and
I
'll
go
,
punctiwal
to
the
time

<EOS>
The
deputy
-
shepherd
wo
n't

Sammy
;
the
deputy
-
shepherd
wo
n't

"
 
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Weller
was
seized
with
a
paroxysm
of
chuckles
,
which
gradually
terminated
in
as
near
an
approach
to
a
choke
as
an
elderly
gentleman
can
,
with
safety
,
sustain
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
never
see
sitch
an
old
ghost
in
all
my
born
days
,
"
exclaimed
Sam
,
rubbing
the
old
gentleman
's
back
,
hard
enough
to
set
him
on
fire
with
the
friction
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
a
-
laughin
'
at
,
corpilence
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
 
Sammy
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
looking
round
him
with
increased
caution
,
and
speaking
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Two
friends
o
'
mine
,
as
works
the
Oxford
Road
,
and
is
up
to
all
kinds
o

games
,
has
got
the
deputy
-
shepherd
safe
in
tow
,
Sammy
;
and
ven
he
does
come
to
the
Ebenezer
Junction
<EOS>
(
vich
he
's
sure
to
do
:
for
they
'll
see
him
to
the
door
,
and
shove
him
in
,
if
necessary
)
<EOS>
,
he
'll
be
as
far
gone
in
rum
-
and
-
water
,
as
ever
he
wos
at
the
Markis
o
'
Granby
,
Dorkin
'
,
and
that
's
not
sayin
'
a
little
neither
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
this
,
Mr
Weller
once
more
laughed
immoderately
,
and
once
more
relapsed
into
a
state
of
partial
suffocation
,
in
consequence
.
   
<EOS>
Nothing
could
have
been
more
in
accordance
with
Sam
Weller
's
feelings
than
the
projected
exposure
of
the
real
propensities
and
qualities
of
the
red
-
nosed
man
;
and
it
being
very
near
the
appointed
hour
of
meeting
,
the
father
and
son
took
their
way
at
once
to
Brick
Lane
<EOS>
,
Sam
not
forgetting
to
drop
his
letter
into
a
general
post
-
office
as
they
walked
along
.
   
<EOS>
The
monthly
meetings
of
the
Brick
Lane
Branch
of
the
United
Grand
Junction
Ebenezer
Temperance
Association
were
held
in
a
large
room
,
pleasantly
and
airily
situated
at
the
top
of
a
safe
and
commodious
ladder
.
 
<EOS>
The
president
was
the
straight
-
walking
Mr
Anthony
Humm
,
a
converted
fireman
,
now
a
schoolmaster
,
and
occasionally
an
itinerant
preacher
;
and
the
secretary
was
Mr
Jonas
Mudge
,
chandler
's
shopkeeper
,
an
enthusiastic
and
disinterested
vessel
,
who
sold
tea
to
the
members
.
 
<EOS>
Previous
to
the
commencement
of
business
,
the
ladies
sat
upon
forms
,
and
drank
tea
,
till
such
time
as
they
considered
it
expedient
to
leave
off
;
and
a
large
wooden
money
-
box
was
conspicuously
placed
upon
the
green
baize
cloth
of
the
business
-
table
,
behind
which
the
secretary
stood
,
and
acknowledged
,
with
a
gracious
smile
,
every
addition
to
the
rich
vein
of
copper
which
lay
concealed
within
.
   
<EOS>
On
this
particular
occasion
the
women
drank
tea
to
a
most
alarming
extent
;
greatly
to
the
horror
of
Mr
Weller
,
senior
,
who
,
utterly
regardless
of
all
Sam
's
admonitory
nudgings
,
stared
about
him
in
every
direction
with
the
most
undisguised
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sammy
,
"
whispered
Mr
Weller
,
"
if
some

<EOS>
these

people

<EOS>
"
Be

"
murmured
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
"
whispered
Mr
Weller
,
a
moment
afterwards
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
agitation
,
"
mark
my

my

<EOS>
If

<EOS>
"
Well

If
this
here
lasts
much
longer
,
Sammy

said
Mr
Weller
,
in
the
same
low
voice
,
"
I
shall
feel

my

"
   
<EOS>
There
is
little
doubt
that
Mr
Weller
would
have
carried
his
benevolent
intention
into
immediate
execution
,
if
a
great
noise
,
occasioned
by
putting
up
the
cups
and
saucers
,
had
not
very
fortunately
announced
that
the
tea
-
drinking
was
over
.
 
<EOS>
The
crockery
having
been
removed
,
the
table
with
the
green
baize
cover
was
carried
out
into
the
centre
of
the
room
,
and
the
business
of
the
evening
was
commenced
by
a
little
emphatic
man
,
with
a
bald
head
and
drab
shorts
,
who
suddenly
rushed
up
the
ladder
,
at
the
imminent
peril
of
snapping
the
two
little
legs
incased
in
the
drab
shorts
,
and
said
---
   
"
<EOS>
Ladies
and
gentlemen
,
I
move
our
excellent
brother
,
Mr
Anthony
Humm
,
into
the
chair

"
   
<EOS>
The
ladies
waved
a
choice
selection
of
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
at
this
proposition
;
and
the
impetuous
little
man
literally
moved
Mr
Humm
into
the
chair
,
by
taking
him
by
the
shoulders
and
thrusting
him
into
a
mahogany
-
frame
which
had
once
represented
that
article
of
furniture
.
 
<EOS>
The
waving
of
handkerchiefs
was
renewed
;
and
Mr
Humm
,
who
was
a
sleek
,
white
-
faced
man
,
in
a
perpetual
perspiration
,
bowed
meekly
,
to
the
great
admiration
of
the
females
,
and
formally
took
his
seat
.
 
<EOS>
Silence
was
then
proclaimed
by
the
little
man
in
the
drab
shorts
,
and
Mr
Humm
rose
and
said

That
,
with
the
permission
of
his
Brick
Lane
Branch

then

there

the

handkerchiefs

sneezed

the
cough
which
always
seizes
an
assembly

when
anything
particular

having

the

Is
now
out

penniless

thinks
it
must
be
the
porter

the
loss

the
use

his
right

is
not
certain

thinks
it
very
likely
that

water

his

expressing

had
written

song

<EOS>
Any
further
observations
from
the
indignant
old
gentleman
were
cut
short
by
the
announcement
of
the
song
,
which
Mr
Anthony
Humm
gave
out
two
lines
at
a
time
,
for
the
information
of
such
of
his
hearers
as
were
unacquainted
with
the
legend
.
<EOS>
While
it
was
being
sung
,
the
little
man
with
the
drab
shorts
disappeared
;
he
returned
immediately
on
its
conclusion
,
and
whispered
Mr
Anthony
Humm
,
with
a
face
of
the
deepest
importance
.
<EOS>
"
My
friends
,
"
said
Mr
Humm
,
holding
up
his
hand
in
a
deprecatory
manner
,
to
bespeak
the
silence
of
such
of
the
stout
old
ladies
as
were
yet
a
line
or
two
behind
;
"
my
friends
,
a
delegate
from
the
Dorking
Branch

our
society

Brother
Stiggins

<EOS>
Out
came
the
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
again
,
in
greater
force
than
ever
;
for
Mr
Stiggins
was
excessively
popular
among
the
female
constituency
of
Brick
Lane
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
may
approach
,
I
think

said
Mr

looking
round
him
,
with
a
fat
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Brother
Tadger
,
let
him
come
forth
and
greet
us

"
   
<EOS>
The
little
man
in
the
drab
shorts
who
answered
to
the
name
of
Brother
Tadger
,
bustled
down
the
ladder
with
great
speed
,
and
was
immediately
afterwards
heard
tumbling
up
with
the
Reverend
Mr
Stiggins
.
   
<EOS>
"
He

purple
in

laughter

As
Sam
Weller
spoke
,
the
little
door
flew
open
,
and
Brother
Tadger
appeared
,
closely
followed
by
the
Reverend
Mr
Stiggins
,
who
no
sooner
entered
,
than
there
was
a
great
clapping
of
hands
,
and
stamping
of
feet
,
and
flourishing
of
handkerchiefs
;
to
all
of
which
manifestations
of
delight
<EOS>
,
Brother
Stiggins
returned
no
other
acknowledgment
than
staring
with
a
wild
eye
,
and
a
fixed
smile
,
at
the
extreme
top
of
the
wick
of
the
candle
on
the
table
,
swaying
his
body
to
and
fro
,
meanwhile
,
in
a
very
unsteady
and
uncertain
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
unwell
,
Brother
Stiggins
?
<EOS>
"
whispered
Mr
Anthony
Humm
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
all
right
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Stiggins
,
in
a
tone
in
which
ferocity
was
blended
with
an
extreme
thickness
of
utterance
;
"
I
am
all
right
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
very
well
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Anthony
Humm
,
retreating
a
few
paces
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
no
man
here
has
ventured
to
say
that
I
am
not
all
right

said
Mr
Stiggins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

certainly
not

said
Mr
Humm
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
advise
him
not
to

Sir

I
should
advise
him
not

said
Mr
Stiggins
.
   
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
audience
were
perfectly
silent
,
and
waited
with
some
anxiety
for
the
resumption
of
business
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
address
the
meeting
,
brother
?
"
said
Mr
Humm
,
with
a
smile
of
invitation
.
   
<EOS>
"
No

"
rejoined
Mr
Stiggins
;
"
No

<EOS>
I
will
not

"
   
<EOS>
The
meeting
looked
at
each
other
with
raised
eyelids
;
and
a
murmur
of
astonishment
ran
through
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
opinion
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Stiggins
,
unbuttoning
his
coat
,
and
speaking
very
loudly
---
<EOS>
"
it
's
my
opinion
,
sir
,
that
this
meeting
is
drunk
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Brother
Tadger
,
sir
!
"
said
Mr
Stiggins
,
suddenly
increasing
in
ferocity
,
and
turning
sharp
round
on
the
little
man
in
the
drab
shorts
,
"
YOU
are
drunk
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
this
,
Mr
Stiggins
,
entertaining
a
praiseworthy
desire
to
promote
the
sobriety
of
the
meeting
,
and
to
exclude
therefrom
all
improper
characters
,
hit
Brother
Tadger
on
the
summit
of
the
nose
with
such
unerring
aim
,
that
the
drab
shorts
disappeared
like
a
flash
of
lightning
.
<EOS>
Brother
Tadger
had
been
knocked
,
head
first
,
down
the
ladder
.
   
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
women
set
up
a
loud
and
dismal
screaming
;
and
rushing
in
small
parties
before
their
favourite
brothers
,
flung
their
arms
around
them
to
preserve
them
from
danger
.
 
<EOS>
An
instance
of
affection
,
which
had
nearly
proved
fatal
to
Humm
,
who
,
being
extremely
popular
,
was
all
but
suffocated
,
by
the
crowd
of
female
devotees
that
hung
about
his
neck
,
and
heaped
caresses
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
greater
part
of
the
lights
were
quickly
put
out
,
and
nothing
but
noise
and
confusion
resounded
on
all
sides
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now

Sammy

said
Mr
Weller
,
taking
off
his
greatcoat
with
much
deliberation
,
"
just

inquired

"
Never

ockipy
myself
in
<EOS>
havin'
a
small
settlement
with
that
'
ere
Stiggins
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Before
Sam
could
interfere
to
prevent
it
,
his
heroic
parent
had
penetrated
into
a
remote
corner
of
the
room
,
and
attacked
the
Reverend
Mr
Stiggins
with
manual
dexterity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
off
!
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
on
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Weller
;
and
without
further
invitation
he
gave
the
Reverend
Mr
Stiggins
a
preliminary
tap
on
the
head
,
and
began
dancing
round
him
in
a
buoyant
and
cork
-
like
manner
,
which
in
a
gentleman
at
his
time
of
life
was
a
perfect
marvel
to
behold
.
   
<EOS>
Finding
all
remonstrances
unavailing
,
Sam
pulled
his
hat
firmly
on
,
threw
his
father
's
coat
over
his
arm
,
and
taking
the
old
man
round
the
waist
,
forcibly
dragged
him
down
the
ladder
,
and
into
the
street
;
never
releasing
his
hold
,
or
permitting
him
to
stop
,
until
they
reached
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
gained
it
,
they
could
hear
the
shouts
of
the
populace
,
who
were
witnessing
the
removal
of
the
Reverend
Mr
Stiggins
to
strong
lodgings
for
the
night
,
and
could
hear
the
noise
occasioned
by
the
dispersion
in
various
directions
of
the
members
of
the
Brick
Lane
Branch
of
the
United
Grand
Junction
Ebenezer
Temperance
Association

Chapter
34

<EOS>
Is
wholly
devoted
to
a
full
and
faithful
report
of
the
memorable
trial
of
Bardell
against
Pickwick
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
the
foreman
of
the
jury
,
whoever
he
'll
be
,
has
got
for
breakfast
,
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
,
by
way
of
keeping
up
a
conversation
on
the
eventful
morning
of
the
fourteenth
of
February
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Perker
,
"
I
hope
he
's
got
a
good
one
.
"
<EOS>
"
Why
so
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Highly
important
---
very
important
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
replied
Perker
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
good
,
contented
,
well
-
breakfasted
juryman
is
a
capital
thing
to
get
hold
of
.
 
<EOS>
Discontented
or
hungry
jurymen
,
my
dear
sir
,
always
find
for
the
plaintiff
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Bless
my
heart
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
very
blank
,
"
what
do
they
do
that
for
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
do
n't
know
,
"
replied
the
little
man
coolly
;
"
saves
time
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
's
near
dinner
-
time
,
the
foreman
takes
out
his
watch
when
the
jury
has
retired
,
and
says
,
"
Dear
me
,
gentlemen
,
ten
minutes
to
five
,
I
declare
!
 
<EOS>
I
dine
at
five
,
gentlemen
.
"
<EOS>
"
So
do
I
,
"
says
everybody
else
,
except
two
men
who
ought
to
have
dined
at
three
and
seem
more
than
half
disposed
to
stand
out
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
The
foreman
smiles
,
and
puts
up
his
watch
:
---
"
Well
,
gentlemen
,
what
do
we
say
,
plaintiff
or
defendant
,
gentlemen
?
 
<EOS>
I
rather
think
,
so
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
gentlemen
,
---
I
say
,
I
rather
think
---
but
do
n't
let
that
influence
you
---
<EOS>
I
RATHER
think
the
plaintiff
's
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
this
,
two
or
three
other
men
are
sure
to
say
that
they
think
so
too
---
as
of
course
they
do
;
and
then
they
get
on
very
unanimously
and
comfortably
.
 
<EOS>
Ten
minutes
past
nine
!
"
said
the
little
man
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
<EOS>
"
Time
we
were
off
,
my
dear
sir
;
breach
of
promise
trial

court
is
generally
full
in

cases

<EOS>
You

better
ring
for
a
coach
,
my
dear
sir
,
or
we
shall
be
rather
late
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
immediately
rang
the
bell
,
and
a
coach
having
been
procured
,
the
four
Pickwickians
and
Mr
Perker
ensconced
themselves
therein
,
and
drove
to
Guildhall
;
Sam
Weller
,
Mr
Lowten
,
and
the
blue
bag
,
following
in
a
cab
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lowten
,
"
said
Perker
,
when
they
reached
the
outer
hall
of
the
court
,
"
put
Mr
Pickwick
's
friends
in
the
students
"
box
;
Mr
Pickwick
himself
had
better
sit
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
This
way
,
my
dear
sir
,
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Taking
Mr
Pickwick
by
the
coat
sleeve
,
the
little
man
led
him
to
the
low
seat
just
beneath
the
desks
of
the
King
's
Counsel
,
which
is
constructed
for
the
convenience
of
attorneys
,
who
from
that
spot
can
whisper
into
the
ear
of
the
leading
counsel
in
the
case
,
any
instructions
that
may
be
necessary
during
the
progress
of
the
trial
.
 
<EOS>
The
occupants
of
this
seat
are
invisible
to
the
great
body
of
spectators
,
inasmuch
as
they
sit
on
a
much
lower
level
than
either
the
barristers
or
the
audience
,
whose
seats
are
raised
above
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
they
have
their
backs
to
both
,
and
their
faces
towards
the
judge
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
witness
-
box
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
pointing
to
a
kind
of
pulpit
,
with
a
brass
rail
,
on
his
left
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
witness
-
box
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
replied
Perker
,
disinterring
a
quantity
of
papers
from
the
blue
bag
,
which
Lowten
had
just
deposited
at
his
feet
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
pointing
to
a
couple
of
enclosed
seats
on
his
right
,
"
that
's
where
the
jurymen
sit
,
is
it
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
identical
place
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
replied
Perker
,
tapping
the
lid
of
his
snuff
-
box
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
stood
up
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
,
and
took
a
glance
at
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
already
a
pretty
large
sprinkling
of
spectators
in
the
gallery
,
and
a
numerous
muster
of
gentlemen
in
wigs
,
in
the
barristers
<EOS>
"
seats
,
who
presented
,
as
a
body
,
all
that
pleasing
and
extensive
variety
of
nose
and
whisker
for
which
the
Bar
of
England
is
so
justly
celebrated
.
 
<EOS>
Such
of
the
gentlemen
as
had
a
brief
to
carry
,
carried
it
in
as
conspicuous
a
manner
as
possible
,
and
occasionally
scratched
their
noses
therewith
,
to
impress
the
fact
more
strongly
on
the
observation
of
the
spectators
.
<EOS>
Other
gentlemen
,
who
had
no
briefs
to
show
,
carried
under
their
arms
goodly
octavos
,
with
a
red
label
behind
,
and
that
under
-
done
-
pie
-
crust
-
coloured
cover
,
which
is
technically
known
as
"
law
calf
.
"
 
Others
,
who
had
neither
briefs
nor
books
,
thrust
their
hands
into
their
pockets
,
and
looked
as
wise
as
they
conveniently
could
;
others
,
again
,
moved
here
and
there
with
great
restlessness
and
earnestness
of
manner
,
content
to
awaken
thereby
the
admiration
and
astonishment
of
the
uninitiated
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
,
to
the
great
wonderment
of
Mr
,
Pickwick
,
were
divided
into
little
groups
,
who
were
chatting
and
discussing
the
news
of
the
day
in
the
most
unfeeling
manner
possible
---
just
as
if
no
trial
at
all
were
coming
on
.
   
<EOS>
A
bow
from
Mr
Phunky
,
as
he
entered
,
and
took
his
seat
behind
the
row
appropriated
to
the
King
's
Counsel
,
attracted
Mr
Pickwick
's
attention
;
and
he
had
scarcely
returned
it
,
when
Mr
Serjeant
Snubbin
appeared
,
followed
by
Mr
Mallard
,
who
half
hid
the
Serjeant
behind
a
large
crimson
bag
,
which
he
placed
on
his
table
,
and
,
after
shaking
hands
with
Perker
,
withdrew
.
<EOS>
Then
there
entered
two
or
three
more
Serjeants
;
and
among
them
,
one
with
a
fat
body
and
a
red
face
,
who
nodded
in
a
friendly
manner
to
Mr
Serjeant
Snubbin
,
and
said
it
was
a
fine
morning
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
's
that
red
-
faced
man
,
who
said
it
was
a
fine
morning
,
and
nodded
to
our
counsel
?
"
<EOS>
whispered
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
"
replied
Perker
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
opposed
to
us
;
he
leads
on
the
other
side
.
 
<EOS>
That
gentleman
behind
him
is
Mr
Skimpin
,
his
junior
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
on
the
point
of
inquiring
,
with
great
abhorrence
of
the
man
's
cold
-
blooded
villainy
,
how
Mr
,
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
who
was
counsel
for
the
opposite
party
,
dared
to
presume
to
tell
Mr
Serjeant
Snubbin
,
who
was
counsel
for
him
,
that
it
was
a
fine
morning
,
when
he
was
interrupted
by
a
general
rising
of
the
barristers
,
and
a
loud
cry
of
"
Silence
!
"
<EOS>
from
the
officers
of
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
round
,
he
found
that
this
was
caused
by
the
entrance
of
the
judge
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Justice
Stareleigh
(
who
sat
in
the
absence
of
the
Chief
Justice
,
occasioned
by
indisposition
)
was
a
most
particularly
short
man
,
and
so
fat
,
that
he
seemed
all
face
and
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
He
rolled
in
,
upon
two
little
turned
legs
,
and
having
bobbed
gravely
to
the
Bar
,
who
bobbed
gravely
to
him
,
put
his
little
legs
underneath
his
table
,
and
his
little
three
-
cornered
hat
upon
it
;
and
when
Mr
Justice
Stareleigh
had
done
this
,
all
you
could
see
of
him
was
two
queer
little
eyes
,
one
broad
pink
face
,
and
somewhere
about
half
of
a
big
and
very
comical
-
looking
wig
.
   
<EOS>
The
judge
had
no
sooner
taken
his
seat
,
than
the
officer
on
the
floor
of
the
court
called
out
"
Silence
!
"
<EOS>
in
a
commanding
tone
,
upon
which
another
officer
in
the
gallery
cried
"
Silence
!
"
<EOS>
in
an
angry
manner
,
whereupon
three
or
four
more
ushers
shouted
"
Silence
!
"
<EOS>
in
a
voice
of
indignant
remonstrance
.
 
<EOS>
This
being
done
,
a
gentleman
in
black
,
who
sat
below
the
judge
,
proceeded
to
call
over
the
names
of
the
jury
;
and
after
a
great
deal
of
bawling
,
it
was
discovered
that
only
ten
special
jurymen
were
present
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Mr
Serjeant
Buzfuz
prayed
a
TALES
;
the
gentleman
in
black
then
proceeded
to
press
into
the
special
jury
,
two
of
the
common
jurymen
;
and
a
greengrocer
and
a
chemist
were
caught
directly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Answer
to
your
names
,
gentlemen
,
that
you
may
be
sworn
,
"
said
the
gentleman
in
black
.
 
<EOS>
"
Richard
Upwitch
.
"
   
<EOS>
"

Thomas
Groffin

<EOS>
"
Take
the
book

gentlemen

<EOS>
You
shall
well
and
truly
try

"
   
"
I
beg
this
court
's
pardon
,
"
said
the
chemist
,
who
was
a
tall
,
thin
,
yellow
-
visaged
man
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
hope
this
court
will
excuse
my
attendance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
what
grounds
,
Sir
?
"
said
Mr
Justice
Stareleigh
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
assistant
,
my
Lord
,
"
said
the
chemist
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
help
that
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Justice
Stareleigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
should
hire
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
afford
it
,
my
Lord
,
"
rejoined
the
chemist
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
ought
to
be
able
to
afford
it
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
judge
,
reddening
;
for
Mr
Justice
Stareleigh
's
temper
bordered
on
the
irritable
,
and
brooked
not
contradiction
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
OUGHT
to
do
,
if
I
got
on
as
well
as
I
deserved
;
but
I
do
n't
,
my
Lord
,
"
answered
the
chemist
.
   
<EOS>
"
Swear
the
gentleman
,
"
said
the
judge
peremptorily
.
   
<EOS>
The
officer
had
got
no
further
than
the
"
You
shall
well
and
truly
try
,
"
when
he
was
again
interrupted
by
the
chemist
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
to
be
sworn
,
my
Lord
,
am
I
?
"
said
the
chemist
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
testy
little
judge
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
,
my
Lord
,
"
replied
the
chemist
,
in
a
resigned
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
there
'll
be
murder
before
this
trial
's
over
;
that
's
all
.
 
<EOS>
Swear
me
,
if
you
please
,
Sir
;
"
and
sworn
the
chemist
was
,
before
the
judge
could
find
words
to
utter
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
merely
wanted
to
observe
,
my
Lord
,
"
said
the
chemist
,
taking
his
seat
with
great
deliberation
,
"
that
I
've
left
nobody
but
an
errand
-
boy
in
my
shop
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
very
nice
boy
,
my
Lord
,
but
he
is
not
acquainted
with
drugs
;
and
I
know
that
the
prevailing
impression
on
his
mind
is
,
that
Epsom
salts
means
oxalic
acid
;
and
syrup
of
senna
,
laudanum
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
,
my
Lord
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
the
tall
chemist
composed
himself
into
a
comfortable
attitude
,
and
,
assuming
a
pleasant
expression
of
countenance
,
appeared
to
have
prepared
himself
for
the
worst
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
regarding
the
chemist
with
feelings
of
the
deepest
horror
,
when
a
slight
sensation
was
perceptible
in
the
body
of
the
court
;
and
immediately
afterwards
Mrs
Bardell
,
supported
by
Mrs
Cluppins
,
was
led
in
,
and
placed
,
in
a
drooping
state
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
seat
on
which
Mr
Pickwick
sat
.
<EOS>
An
extra
-
sized
umbrella
was
then
handed
in
by
Mr
Dodson
,
and
a
pair
of
pattens
by
Mr
Fogg
,
each
of
whom
had
prepared
a
most
sympathising
and
melancholy
face
for
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sanders
then
appeared
,
leading
in
Master
Bardell
.
 
<EOS>
At
sight
of
her
child
,
Mrs
Bardell
started
;
suddenly
recollecting
herself
,
she
kissed
him
in
a
frantic
manner
;
then
relapsing
into
a
state
of
hysterical
imbecility
,
the
good
lady
requested
to
be
informed
where
she
was
.
 
<EOS>
In
reply
to
this
,
Mrs
Cluppins
and
Mrs
Sanders
turned
their
heads
away
and
wept
,
while
Messrs.
Dodson
and
Fogg
entreated
the
plaintiff
to
compose
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Serjeant
Buzfuz
rubbed
his
eyes
very
hard
with
a
large
white
handkerchief
,
and
gave
an
appealing
look
towards
the
jury
,
while
the
judge
was
visibly
affected
,
and
several
of
the
beholders
tried
to
cough
down
their
emotion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
notion
that
indeed
,
"
whispered
Perker
to
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Capital
fellows
those
Dodson
and
Fogg
;
excellent
ideas
of
effect
,
my
dear
Sir
,
excellent
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Perker
spoke
,
Mrs
Bardell
began
to
recover
by
slow
degrees
,
while
Mrs
Cluppins
,
after
a
careful
survey
of
Master
Bardell
's
buttons
and
the
button
-
holes
to
which
they
severally
belonged
,
placed
him
on
the
floor
of
the
court
in
front
of
his
mother
---
a
commanding
position
in
which
he
could
not
fail
to
awaken
the
full
commiseration
and
sympathy
of
both
judge
and
jury
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
not
done
without
considerable
opposition
,
and
many
tears
,
on
the
part
of
the
young
gentleman
himself
,
who
had
certain
inward
misgivings
that
the
placing
him
within
the
full
glare
of
the
judge
's
eye
was
only
a
formal
prelude
to
his
being
immediately
ordered
away
for
instant
execution
,
or
for
transportation
beyond
the
seas
,
during
the
whole
term
of
his
natural
life
,
at
the
very
least
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bardell
and
Pickwick
,
"
cried
the
gentleman
in
black
,
calling
on
the
case
,
which
stood
first
on
the
list
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
for
the
plaintiff
,
my
Lord
,
"
said
Mr
Serjeant
Buzfuz
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
is
with
you
,
Brother
Buzfuz
?
"
said
the
judge
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Skimpin
bowed
,
to
intimate
that
he
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
appear
for
the
defendant
,
my
Lord
,
"
said
Mr
Serjeant
Snubbin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Anybody
with
you
,
Brother
Snubbin
?
"
inquired
the
court
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Phunky
,
my
Lord
,
"
replied
Serjeant
Snubbin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Serjeant
Buzfuz
and
Mr
Skimpin
for
the
plaintiff
,
"
said
the
judge
,
writing
down
the
names
in
his
note
-
book
,
and
reading
as
he
wrote
;
"
for
the
defendant
,
Serjeant
Snubbin
and
Mr
Monkey
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Beg
your
Lordship
's
pardon
,
Phunky
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
very
good
,
"
said
the
judge
;
"
I
never
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
the
gentleman
's
name
before
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Phunky
bowed
and
smiled
,
and
the
judge
bowed
and
smiled
too
,
and
then
Mr
Phunky
,
blushing
into
the
very
whites
of
his
eyes
,
tried
to
look
as
if
he
did
n't
know
that
everybody
was
gazing
at
him
,
a
thing
which
no
man
ever
succeeded
in
doing
yet
,
or
in
all
reasonable
probability
,
ever
will
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
"
said
the
judge
.
   
<EOS>
The
ushers
again
called
silence
,
and
Mr
Skimpin
proceeded
to
"
open
the
case
"
;
and
the
case
appeared
to
have
very
little
inside
it
when
he
had
opened
it
,
for
he
kept
such
particulars
as
he
knew
,
completely
to
himself
,
and
sat
down
,
after
a
lapse
of
three
minutes
,
leaving
the
jury
in
precisely
the
same
advanced
stage
of
wisdom
as
they
were
in
before
.
   
<EOS>
Serjeant
Buzfuz
then
rose
with
all
the
majesty
and
dignity
which
the
grave
nature
of
the
proceedings
demanded
,
and
having
whispered
to
Dodson
,
and
conferred
briefly
with
Fogg
,
pulled
his
gown
over
his
shoulders
,
settled
his
wig
,
and
addressed
the
jury
.
   
<EOS>
Serjeant
Buzfuz
began
by
saying
,
that
never
,
in
the
whole
course
of
his
professional
experience
---
never
,
from
the
very
first
moment
of
his
applying
himself
to
the
study
and
practice
of
the
law
---
had
he
approached
a
case
with
feelings
of
such
deep
emotion
,
or
with
such
a
heavy
sense
of
the
responsibility
imposed
upon
him
---
a
responsibility
,
he
would
say
,
which
he
could
never
have
supported
,
were
he
not
buoyed
up
and
sustained
by
a
conviction
so
strong
,
that
it
amounted
to
positive
certainty
that
the
cause
of
truth
and
justice
,
or
,
in
other
words
,
the
cause
of
his
much
-
injured
and
most
oppressed
client
,
must
prevail
with
the
high
-
minded
and
intelligent
dozen
of
men
whom
he
now
saw
in
that
box
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
Counsel
usually
begin
in
this
way
,
because
it
puts
the
jury
on
the
very
best
terms
with
themselves
,
and
makes
them
think
what
sharp
fellows
they
must
be
.
 
<EOS>
A
visible
effect
was
produced
immediately
,
several
jurymen
beginning
to
take
voluminous
notes
with
the
utmost
eagerness
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
heard
from
my
learned
friend
,
gentlemen
,
"
continued
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
well
knowing
that
,
from
the
learned
friend
alluded
to
,
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
had
heard
just
nothing
at
all
---
"
you
have
heard
from
my
learned
friend
,
gentlemen
,
that
this
is
an
action
for
a
breach
of
promise
of
marriage
,
in
which
the
damages
are
laid
at
#
#
#
#
1,500
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
have
not
heard
from
my
learned
friend
,
inasmuch
as
it
did
not
come
within
my
learned
friend
's
province
to
tell
you
,
what
are
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
Those
facts
and
circumstances
,
gentlemen
<EOS>
,
you
shall
hear
detailed
by
me
,
and
proved
by
the
unimpeachable
female
whom
I
will
place
in
that
box
before
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
,
Mr
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
with
a
tremendous
emphasis
on
the
word
"
box
,
"
smote
his
table
with
a
mighty
sound
,
and
glanced
at
Dodson
and
Fogg
,
who
nodded
admiration
of
the
Serjeant
,
and
indignant
defiance
of
the
defendant
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
plaintiff
,
gentlemen
,
"
continued
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
in
a
soft
and
melancholy
voice
,
"
the
plaintiff
is
a
widow
;
yes
,
gentlemen
,
a
widow
.
 
<EOS>
The
late
Mr
Bardell
,
after
enjoying
,
for
many
years
,
the
esteem
and
confidence
of
his
sovereign
,
as
one
of
the
guardians
of
his
royal
revenues
,
glided
almost
imperceptibly
from
the
world
,
to
seek
elsewhere
for
that
repose
and
peace
which
a
custom
-
house
can
never
afford
.
"
<EOS>
At
this
pathetic
description
of
the
decease
of
Mr
Bardell
,
who
had
been
knocked
on
the
head
with
a
quart
-
pot
in
a
public
-
house
cellar
,
the
learned
serjeant
's
voice
faltered
,
and
he
proceeded
,
with
emotion
---
   
<EOS>
"
Some
time
before
his
death
,
he
had
stamped
his
likeness
upon
a
little
boy
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
little
boy
,
the
only
pledge
of
her
departed
exciseman
,
Mrs
Bardell
shrank
from
the
world
,
and
courted
the
retirement
and
tranquillity
of
Goswell
Street
;
and
here
she
placed
in
her
front
parlour
window
a
written
placard
,
bearing
this
inscription
---
"
Apartments
furnished
for
a
single
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Inquire
within
.
"
<EOS>
"
Here
Serjeant
Buzfuz
paused
,
while
several
gentlemen
of
the
jury
took
a
note
of
the
document
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
date
to
that
,
is
there
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
a
juror
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
date
,
gentlemen
,
"
replied
Serjeant
Buzfuz
;
"
but
I
am
instructed
to
say
that
it
was
put
in
the
plaintiff
's
parlour
window
just
this
time
three
years
.
 
<EOS>
I
entreat
the
attention
of
the
jury
to
the
wording
of
this
document
---
"
Apartments

"
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Bardell
's
opinions
of
the
opposite
sex
,
gentlemen
,
were
derived
from
a
long
contemplation
of
the
inestimable
qualities
of
her
lost
husband
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
no
fear
<EOS>
,
she
had
no
distrust
,
she
had
no
suspicion
;
all
was
confidence
and
reliance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Bardell
,
"
said
the
widow
---
"
<EOS>
Mr
Bardell
was
a
man
of
honour
,
Mr
Bardell
was
a
man
of
his
word
,
Mr
Bardell
was
no
deceiver
,
Mr
Bardell
was
once
a
single
gentleman
himself
;
to
single
gentlemen
I
look
for
protection
,
for
assistance
,
for
comfort
,
and
for
consolation
;
in
single
gentlemen
I
shall
perpetually
see
something
to
remind
me
of
what
Mr
Bardell
was
when
he
first
won
my
young
and
untried
affections
;
to
a
single
gentleman
,
then
,
shall
my
lodgings
be
let
.
<EOS>
"
Actuated
by
this
beautiful
and
touching
impulse
(
among
the
best
impulses
of
our
imperfect
nature
,
gentlemen
)
,
the
lonely
and
desolate
widow
dried
her
tears
,
furnished
her
first
floor
,
caught
her
innocent
boy
to
her
maternal
bosom
,
and
put
the
bill
up
in
her
parlour
window
.
<EOS>
Did
it
remain
there
long
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
The
serpent
was
on
the
watch
,
the
train
was
laid
,
the
mine
was
preparing
,
the
sapper
and
miner
was
at
work
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
bill
had
been
in
the
parlour
window
three
days
---
three
days
,
gentlemen
---
a
being
,
erect
upon
two
legs
,
and
bearing
all
the
outward
semblance
of
a
man
,
and
not
of
a
monster
,
knocked
at
the
door
of
Mrs
Bardell
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
inquired
within
---
he
took
the
lodgings
;
and
on
the
very
next
day
he
entered
into
possession
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
This
man
was
Pickwick
---
Pickwick
,
the
defendant

"
   
<EOS>
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
who
had
proceeded
with
such
volubility
that
his
face
was
perfectly
crimson
,
here
paused
for
breath
.
 
<EOS>
The
silence
awoke
Mr
Justice
Stareleigh
,
who
immediately
wrote
down
something
with
a
pen
without
any
ink
in
it
,
and
looked
unusually
profound
,
to
impress
the
jury
with
the
belief
that
he
always
thought
most
deeply
with
his
eyes
shut
.
 
<EOS>
Serjeant
Buzfuz
proceeded
---
   
<EOS>
"
Of
this
man
Pickwick
I
will
say
little
;
the
subject
presents
but
few
attractions
;
and
I
,
gentlemen
,
am
not
the
man
,
nor
are
you
,
gentlemen
,
the
men
,
to
delight
in
the
contemplation
of
revolting
heartlessness
,
and
of
systematic
villainy
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
had
been
writhing
in
silence
for
some
time
,
gave
a
violent
start
,
as
if
some
vague
idea
of
assaulting
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
in
the
august
presence
of
justice
and
law
,
suggested
itself
to
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
An
admonitory
gesture
from
Perker
restrained
him
,
and
he
listened
to
the
learned
gentleman
's
continuation
with
a
look
of
indignation
,
which
contrasted
forcibly
with
the
admiring
faces
of
Mrs
Cluppins
and
Mrs
Sanders
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
systematic
villainy
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
looking
through
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
talking
AT
him
;
"
and
when
I
say
systematic
villainy
,
let
me
tell
the
defendant
Pickwick
,
if
he
be
in
court
,
as
I
am
informed
he
is
,
that
it
would
have
been
more
decent
in
him
,
more
becoming
,
in
better
judgment
,
and
in
better
taste
,
if
he
had
stopped
away
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
tell
him
,
gentlemen
,
that
any
gestures
of
dissent
or
disapprobation
in
which
he
may
indulge
in
this
court
will
not
go
down
with
you
;
that
you
will
know
how
to
value
and
how
to
appreciate
them
;
and
let
me
tell
him
further
,
as
my
Lord
will
tell
you
,
gentlemen
,
that
a
counsel
,
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
to
his
client
,
is
neither
to
be
intimidated
nor
bullied
,
nor
put
down
;
and
that
any
attempt
to
do
either
the
one
or
the
other
,
or
the
first
,
or
the
last
,
will
recoil
on
the
head

"
   
<EOS>
This
little
divergence
from
the
subject
in
hand
,
had
,
of
course
,
the
intended
effect
of
turning
all
eyes
to
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
having
partially
recovered
from
the
state
of
moral
elevation
into
which
he
had
lashed
himself
,
resumed
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
show
you
,
gentlemen
,
that
for
two
years
,
Pickwick
continued
to
reside
constantly
,
and
without
interruption
or
intermission
,
at
Mrs
Bardell
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
show
you
that
Mrs
Bardell
,
during
the
whole
of
that
time
,
waited
on
him
,
attended
to
his
comforts
,
cooked
his
meals
,
looked
out
his
linen
for
the
washerwoman
when
it
went
abroad
,
darned
,
aired
,
and
prepared
it
for
wear
,
when
it
came
home
,
and
,
in
short
,
enjoyed
his
fullest
trust
and
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
show
you
that
,
on
many
occasions
,
he
gave
halfpence
,
and
on
some
occasions
even
sixpences
,
to
her
little
boy
;
and
I
shall
prove
to
you
,
by
a
witness
whose
testimony
it
will
be
impossible
for
my
learned
friend
to
weaken
or
controvert
,
that
on
one
occasion
he
patted
the
boy
on
the
head
,
and
,
after
inquiring
whether
he
had
won
any
"
ALLEY
TORS
"
or
"
COMMONEYS
"
lately
(
both
of
which
I
understand
to
be
a
particular
species
of
marbles
much
prized
by
the
youth
of
this
town
)
,
made
use
of
this
remarkable
expression
,
"
How
should
you
like
to
have
another
father
?
<EOS>
"
I
shall
prove
to
you
,
gentlemen
,
that
about
a
year
ago
,
Pickwick
suddenly
began
to
absent
himself
from
home
,
during
long
intervals
,
as
if
with
the
intention
of
gradually
breaking
off
from
my
client
;
but
I
shall
show
you
also
,
that
his
resolution
was
not
at
that
time
sufficiently
strong
,
or
that
his
better
feelings
conquered
,
if
better
feelings
he
has
,
or
that
the
charms
and
accomplishments
of
my
client
prevailed
against
his
unmanly
intentions
,
by
proving
to
you
,
that
on
one
occasion
,
when
he
returned
from
the
country
,
he
distinctly
and
in
terms
,
offered
her
marriage
:
previously
,
however
,
taking
special
care
that
there
would
be
no
witness
to
their
solemn
contract
;
and
I
am
in
a
situation
to
prove
to
you
,
on
the
testimony
of
three
of
his
own
friends
---
most
unwilling
witnesses
,
gentlemen
---
most
unwilling
witnesses
---
that
on
that
morning
he
was
discovered
by
them
holding
the
plaintiff
in
his
arms
,
and
soothing
her
agitation
by
his
caresses
and
endearments
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
visible
impression
was
produced
upon
the
auditors
by
this
part
of
the
learned
Serjeant
's
address
.
 
<EOS>
Drawing
forth
two
very
small
scraps
of
paper
,
he
proceeded
---
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
gentlemen
,
but
one
word
more
.
 
<EOS>
Two
letters
have
passed
between
these
parties
,
letters
which
are
admitted
to
be
in
the
handwriting
of
the
defendant
,
and
which
speak
volumes
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
The
letters
,
too
,
bespeak
the
character
of
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
not
open
,
fervent
,
eloquent
epistles
,
breathing
nothing
but
the
language
of
affectionate
attachment
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
covert
,
sly
,
underhanded
communications
,
but
,
fortunately
,
far
more
conclusive
than
if
couched
in
the
most
glowing
language
and
the
most
poetic
imagery
---
letters
that
must
be
viewed
with
a
cautious
and
suspicious
eye
---
letters
that
were
evidently
intended
at
the
time
,
by
Pickwick
,
to
mislead
and
delude
any
third
parties
into
whose
hands
they
might
fall
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
read
the
first
:
"
Garraways
,
twelve
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Mrs
B.
---
Chops
and
tomato
sauce
.
 
<EOS>
Yours
,
PICKWICK
.
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
what
does
this
mean
?
 
<EOS>
Chops
and
tomato
sauce
.
 
<EOS>
Yours
,
Pickwick
!
 
<EOS>
Chops
!
 
<EOS>
Gracious
heavens
!
<EOS>
and
tomato
sauce
!
 
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
is
the
happiness
of
a
sensitive
and
confiding
female
to
be
trifled
away
,
by
such
shallow
artifices
as
these
?
 
<EOS>
The
next
has
no
date
whatever
,
which
is
in
itself
suspicious
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
Mrs
B.
,
I
shall
not
be
at
home
till
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Slow
coach
.
<EOS>
"
And
then
follows
this
very
remarkable
expression
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
trouble
yourself
about
the
warming
-
pan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
warming
-
pan
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
gentlemen
,
who
DOES
trouble
himself
about
a
warming
-
pan
?
<EOS>
When
was
the
peace
of
mind
of
man
or
woman
broken
or
disturbed
by
a
warming
-
pan
,
which
is
in
itself
a
harmless
,
a
useful
,
and
I
will
add
,
gentlemen
,
a
comforting
article
of
domestic
furniture
?
 
<EOS>
Why
is
Mrs
Bardell
so
earnestly
entreated
not
to
agitate
herself
about
this
warming
-
pan
,
unless
(
as
is
no
doubt
the
case
)
<EOS>
it
is
a
mere
cover
for
hidden
fire
---
a
mere
substitute
for
some
endearing
word
or
promise
,
agreeably
to
a
preconcerted
system
of
correspondence
,
artfully
contrived
by
Pickwick
with
a
view
to
his
contemplated
desertion
,
and
which
I
am
not
in
a
condition
to
explain
?
 
<EOS>
And
what
does
this
allusion
to
the
slow
coach
mean
?
 
<EOS>
For
aught
<EOS>
I
know
,
it
may
be
a
reference
to
Pickwick
himself
,
who
has
most
unquestionably
been
a
criminally
slow
coach
during
the
whole
of
this
transaction
,
but
whose
speed
will
now
be
very
unexpectedly
accelerated
,
and
whose
wheels
,
gentlemen
,
as
he
will
find
to
his
cost
,
will
very
soon
be
greased
by
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Serjeant
Buzfuz
paused
in
this
place
,
to
see
whether
the
jury
smiled
at
his
joke
;
but
as
nobody
took
it
but
the
greengrocer
,
whose
sensitiveness
on
the
subject
was
very
probably
occasioned
by
his
having
subjected
a
chaise
-
cart
to
the
process
in
question
on
that
identical
morning
,
the
learned
Serjeant
considered
it
advisable
to
undergo
a
slight
relapse
into
the
dismals
before
he
concluded
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
enough
of
this
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Mr
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
"
it
is
difficult
to
smile
with
an
aching
heart
;
it
is
ill
jesting
when
our
deepest
sympathies
are
awakened
.
 
<EOS>
My
client
's
hopes
and
prospects
are
ruined
,
and
it
is
no
figure
of
speech
to
say
that
her
occupation
is
gone
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
The
bill
is
down
---
but
there
is
no
tenant
.
 
<EOS>
Eligible
single
gentlemen
pass
and
repass
-
<EOS>
but
there
is
no
invitation
for
to
inquire
within
or
without
.
 
<EOS>
All
is
gloom
and
silence
in
the
house
;
even
the
voice
of
the
child
is
hushed
;
his
infant
sports
are
disregarded
when
his
mother
weeps
;
his
"
alley
tors
"
and
his
"
commoneys
"
are
alike
neglected
;
he
forgets
the
long
familiar
cry
of
"
knuckle
down
,
"
and
at
tip
-
cheese
,
or
odd
and
even
,
his
hand
is
out
.
 
<EOS>
But
Pickwick
,
gentlemen
,
Pickwick
,
the
ruthless
destroyer
of
this
domestic
oasis
in
the
desert
of
Goswell
Street
---
Pickwick
who
has
choked
up
the
well
,
and
thrown
ashes
on
the
sward
---
Pickwick
,
who
comes
before
you
to
-
day
with
his
heartless
tomato
sauce
and
warming
-
pans
---
Pickwick
still
rears
his
head
with
unblushing
effrontery
,
and
gazes
without
a
sigh
on
the
ruin
he
has
made
.
 
<EOS>
Damages
,
gentlemen
---
<EOS>
heavy
damages
is
the
only
punishment
with
which
you
can
visit
him
;
the
only
recompense
you
can
award
to
my
client
.
 
<EOS>
And
for
those
damages
she
now
appeals
to
an
enlightened
,
a
high
-
minded
,
a
right
-
feeling
,
a
conscientious
,
a
dispassionate
,
a
sympathising
,
a
contemplative
jury
of
her
civilised
countrymen
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
beautiful
peroration
,
Mr
Serjeant
Buzfuz
sat
down
,
and
Mr
Justice
Stareleigh
woke
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Call
Elizabeth
Cluppins
,
"
said
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
rising
a
minute
afterwards
,
with
renewed
vigour
.
   
<EOS>
The
nearest
usher
called
for
Elizabeth
Tuppins
;
another
one
,
at
a
little
distance
off
,
demanded
Elizabeth
Jupkins
;
and
a
third
rushed
in
a
breathless
state
into
King
Street
,
and
screamed
for
Elizabeth
Muffins
till
he
was
hoarse
.
   
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Mrs
Cluppins
,
with
the
combined
assistance
of
Mrs
Bardell
,
Mrs
Sanders
,
Mr
Dodson
,
and
Mr
Fogg
,
was
hoisted
into
the
witness
-
box
;
and
when
she
was
safely
perched
on
the
top
step
,
Mrs
Bardell
stood
on
the
bottom
one
,
with
the
pocket
-
handkerchief
and
pattens
in
one
hand
,
and
a
glass
bottle
that
might
hold
about
a
quarter
of
a
pint
of
smelling
-
salts
in
the
other
,
ready
for
any
emergency
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sanders
,
whose
eyes
were
intently
fixed
on
the
judge
's
face
,
planted
herself
close
by
,
with
the
large
umbrella
,
keeping
her
right
thumb
pressed
on
the
spring
with
an
earnest
countenance
,
as
if
she
were
fully
prepared
to
put
it
up
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Cluppins
,
"
said
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
"
pray
compose
yourself
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Of
course
,
directly
Mrs
Cluppins
was
desired
to
compose
herself
,
she
sobbed
with
increased
vehemence
,
and
gave
divers
alarming
manifestations
of
an
approaching
fainting
fit
,
or
,
as
she
afterwards
said
,
of
her
feelings
being
too
many
for
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
recollect
,
Mrs
Cluppins
,
"
said
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
after
a
few
unimportant
questions
---
"
do
you
recollect
being
in
Mrs
Bardell
's
back
one
pair
of
stairs
,
on
one
particular
morning
in
July
last
,
when
she
was
dusting
Pickwick
's
apartment
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
Lord
and
jury
,
I
do
,
"
replied
Mrs
Cluppins
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
sitting
-
room
was
the
first
-
floor
front
,
I
believe
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
were
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mrs
Cluppins
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
were
you
doing
in
the
back
room
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
little
judge
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
Lord
and
jury
,
"
said
Mrs
Cluppins
,
with
interesting
agitation
,
"
I
will
not
deceive
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
not
,
ma'am
,
"
said
the
little
judge
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
there
,
"
resumed
Mrs
Cluppins
,
"
unbeknown
to
Mrs
Bardell
;
I
had
been
out
with
a
little
basket
,
gentlemen
,
to
buy
three
pound
of
red
kidney
pertaties
,
which
was
three
pound
tuppence
ha'penny
,
when
I
see
Mrs
Bardell
's
street
door
on
the
jar
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
the
what
?
"
exclaimed
the
little
judge
.
   
<EOS>
"
Partly
open
,
my
Lord
,
"
said
Serjeant
Snubbin
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
said
on
the
jar
,
"
said
the
little
judge
,
with
a
cunning
look
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
the
same
,
my
Lord
,
"
said
Serjeant
Snubbin
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
judge
looked
doubtful
,
and
said
he
'd
make
a
note
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Cluppins
then
resumed
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
walked
in
,
gentlemen
,
just
to
say
good
-
mornin
'
,
and
went
,
in
a
permiscuous
manner
,
upstairs
,
and
into
the
back
room
.
 
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
there
was
the
sound
of
voices
in
the
front
room
,
and
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
And
you
listened
,
I
believe
,
Mrs
Cluppins
?
"
said
Serjeant
Buzfuz
.
   
<EOS>
"
Beggin
'
your
pardon
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mrs
Cluppins
,
in
a
majestic
manner
,
"
I
would
scorn
the
haction
.
 
<EOS>
The
voices
was
very
loud
,
Sir
,
and
forced
themselves
upon
my
ear
,
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mrs
Cluppins
,
you
were
not
listening
,
but
you
heard
the
voices
.
 
<EOS>
Was
one
of
those
voices
Pickwick
's
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
were
,
Sir
.
"
<EOS>
And
Mrs
Cluppins
,
after
distinctly
stating
that
Mr
Pickwick
addressed
himself
to
Mrs
Bardell
,
repeated
by
slow
degrees
,
and
by
dint
of
many
questions
,
the
conversation
with
which
our
readers
are
already
acquainted
.
   
<EOS>
The
jury
looked
suspicious
,
and
Mr
Serjeant
Buzfuz
smiled
as
he
sat
down
.
 
<EOS>
They
looked
positively
awful
when
Serjeant
Snubbin
intimated
that
he
should
not
cross
-
examine
the
witness
,
for
Mr
Pickwick
wished
it
to
be
distinctly
stated
that
it
was
due
to
her
to
say
,
that
her
account
was
in
substance
correct
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Cluppins
having
once
broken
the
ice
,
thought
it
a
favourable
opportunity
for
entering
into
a
short
dissertation
on
her
own
domestic
affairs
;
so
she
straightway
proceeded
to
inform
the
court
that
she
was
the
mother
of
eight
children
at
that
present
speaking
,
and
that
she
entertained
confident
expectations
of
presenting
Mr
Cluppins
with
a
ninth
,
somewhere
about
that
day
six
months
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
interesting
point
,
the
little
judge
interposed
most
irascibly
;
and
the
effect
of
the
interposition
was
,
that
both
the
worthy
lady
and
Mrs
Sanders
were
politely
taken
out
of
court
,
under
the
escort
of
Mr
Jackson
,
without
further
parley
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nathaniel
Winkle
!
"
said
Mr
Skimpin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
!
"
replied
a
feeble
voice
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
entered
the
witness
-
box
,
and
having
been
duly
sworn
,
bowed
to
the
judge
with
considerable
deference
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
look
at
me
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
judge
sharply
,
in
acknowledgment
of
the
salute
;
"
look
at
the
jury
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
obeyed
the
mandate
,
and
looked
at
the
place
where
he
thought
it
most
probable
the
jury
might
be
;
for
seeing
anything
in
his
then
state
of
intellectual
complication
was
wholly
out
of
the
question
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
was
then
examined
by
Mr
Skimpin
,
who
,
being
a
promising
young
man
of
two
or
three
-
and
-
forty
,
was
of
course
anxious
to
confuse
a
witness
who
was
notoriously
predisposed
in
favour
of
the
other
side
,
as
much
as
he
could
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Skimpin
,
"
have
the
goodness
to
let
his
Lordship
know
what
your
name
is
,
will
you
?
"
<EOS>
and
Mr
Skimpin
inclined
his
head
on
one
side
to
listen
with
great
sharpness
to
the
answer
,
and
glanced
at
the
jury
meanwhile
,
as
if
to
imply
that
he
rather
expected
Mr
Winkle
's
natural
taste
for
perjury
would
induce
him
to
give
some
name
which
did
not
belong
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Winkle
,
"
replied
the
witness
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
your
Christian
name
,
Sir
?
"
<EOS>
angrily
inquired
the
little
judge
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nathaniel
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Daniel
---
any
other
name
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nathaniel
,
sir
---
my
Lord
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nathaniel
Daniel
,
or
Daniel
Nathaniel
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
Lord
,
only
Nathaniel
---
not
Daniel
at
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
tell
me
it
was
Daniel
for
,
then
,
sir
?
"
inquired
the
judge
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
,
my
Lord
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
did
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
judge
,
with
a
severe
frown
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
could
I
have
got
Daniel
on
my
notes
,
unless
you
told
me
so
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
argument
was
,
of
course
,
unanswerable
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Winkle
has
rather
a
short
memory
,
my
Lord
,
"
interposed
Mr
Skimpin
,
with
another
glance
at
the
jury
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
find
means
to
refresh
it
before
we
have
quite
done
with
him
,
I
dare
say
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
be
careful
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
little
judge
,
with
a
sinister
look
at
the
witness
.
   
<EOS>
Poor
Mr
Winkle
bowed
,
and
endeavoured
to
feign
an
easiness
of
manner
,
which
,
in
his
then
state
of
confusion
,
gave
him
rather
the
air
of
a
disconcerted
pickpocket
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr
Winkle
,
"
said
Mr
Skimpin
,
"
attend
to
me
,
if
you
please
,
Sir
;
and
let
me
recommend
you
,
for
your
own
sake
,
to
bear
in
mind
his
Lordship
's
injunctions
to
be
careful
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
are
a
particular
friend
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
the
defendant
,
are
you
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
known
Mr
Pickwick
now
,
as
well
as
I
recollect
at
this
moment
,
nearly
---
"
   
"
Pray
,
Mr
Winkle
,
do
not
evade
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
,
or
are
you
not
,
a
particular
friend
of
the
defendant
's
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
just
about
to
say
,
that
---
"
   
"
Will
you
,
or
will
you
not
,
answer
my
question
,
Sir
?
"
"
If
you
do
n't
answer
the
question
,
you
'll
be
committed
,
Sir
,
"
interposed
the
little
judge
,
looking
over
his
note
-
book
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Skimpin
,
"
yes
<EOS>
or
no
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
And
why
could
n't
you
say
that
at
once
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
know
the
plaintiff
too
?
 
<EOS>
Eh
,
Mr
Winkle
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
her
;
I
've
seen
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
do
n't
know
her
,
but
you
've
seen
her
?
 
<EOS>
Now
,
have
the
goodness
to
tell
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
what
you
mean
by
that
,
Mr
Winkle
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
I
am
not
intimate
with
her
,
but
I
have
seen
her
when
I
went
to
call
on
Mr
Pickwick
,
in
Goswell
Street
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
often
have
you
seen
her
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
often
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Yes
,
Mr
Winkle
,
how
often
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
repeat
the
question
for
you
a
dozen
times
,
if
you
require
it
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
the
learned
gentleman
,
with
a
firm
and
steady
frown
,
placed
his
hands
on
his
hips
,
and
smiled
suspiciously
to
the
jury
.
   
<EOS>
On
this
question
there
arose
the
edifying
brow
-
beating
,
customary
on
such
points
.
 
<EOS>
First
of
all
,
Mr
Winkle
said
it
was
quite
impossible
for
him
to
say
how
many
times
he
had
seen
Mrs
Bardell
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
was
asked
if
he
had
seen
her
twenty
times
,
to
which
he
replied
,
"
Certainly
---
more
than
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
he
was
asked
whether
he
had
n't
seen
her
a
hundred
times
---
whether
he
could
n't
swear
that
he
had
seen
her
more
than
fifty
times
---
whether
he
did
n't
know
that
he
had
seen
her
at
least
seventy
-
five
times
,
and
so
forth
;
the
satisfactory
conclusion
which
was
arrived
at
,
at
last
,
being
,
that
he
had
better
take
care
of
himself
,
and
mind
what
he
was
about
.
 
<EOS>
The
witness
having
been
by
these
means
reduced
to
the
requisite
ebb
of
nervous
perplexity
,
the
examination
was
continued
as
follows
---
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Mr
Winkle
,
do
you
remember
calling
on
the
defendant
Pickwick
at
these
apartments
in
the
plaintiff
's
house
in
Goswell
Street
,
on
one
particular
morning
,
in
the
month
of
July
last
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Were
you
accompanied
on
that
occasion
by
a
friend
of
the
name
of
Tupman
,
and
another
by
the
name
of
Snodgrass
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
they
here
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
they
are
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
,
looking
very
earnestly
towards
the
spot
where
his
friends
were
stationed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
attend
to
me
,
Mr
Winkle
,
and
never
mind
your
friends
,
"
said
Mr
Skimpin
,
with
another
expressive
look
at
the
jury
.
<EOS>
"
They
must
tell
their
stories
without
any
previous
consultation
with
you
,
if
none
has
yet
taken
place
(
another
look
at
the
jury
)
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Sir
,
tell
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
what
you
saw
on
entering
the
defendant
's
room
,
on
this
particular
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Come
;
out
with
it
,
Sir
;
we
must
have
it
,
sooner
or
later
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
defendant
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
was
holding
the
plaintiff
in
his
arms
,
with
his
hands
clasping
her
waist
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
with
natural
hesitation
,
"
and
the
plaintiff
appeared
to
have
fainted
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hear
the
defendant
say
anything
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
heard
him
call
Mrs
Bardell
a
good
creature
,
and
I
heard
him
ask
her
to
compose
herself
,
for
what
a
situation
it
was
,
if
anybody
should
come
,
or
words
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr
Winkle
,
I
have
only
one
more
question
to
ask
you
,
and
I
beg
you
to
bear
in
mind
his
Lordship
's
caution
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
undertake
to
swear
that
Pickwick
,
the
defendant
,
did
not
say
on
the
occasion
in
question
---
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mrs
Bardell
,
you
're
a
good
creature
;
compose
yourself
to
this
situation
,
for
to
this
situation
you
must
come
,
"
or
words
to
that
effect
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
did
n't
understand
him
so
,
certainly
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
astounded
on
this
ingenious
dove
-
tailing
of
the
few
words
he
had
heard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
on
the
staircase
,
and
could
n't
hear
distinctly
;
the
impression
on
my
mind
is
---
"
   
"
The
gentlemen
of
the
jury
want
none
of
the
impressions
on
your
mind
,
Mr
Winkle
,
which
I
fear
would
be
of
little
service
to
honest
,
straightforward
men
,
"
interposed
Mr
Skimpin
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
were
on
the
staircase
,
and
did
n't
distinctly
hear
;
but
you
will
not
swear
that
Pickwick
did
not
make
use
of
the
expressions
I
have
quoted
?
 
<EOS>
Do
I
understand
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
will
not
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
;
and
down
sat
Mr
Skimpin
with
a
triumphant
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
case
had
not
gone
off
in
so
particularly
happy
a
manner
,
up
to
this
point
,
that
it
could
very
well
afford
to
have
any
additional
suspicion
cast
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
it
could
afford
to
be
placed
in
a
rather
better
light
,
if
possible
,
Mr
Phunky
rose
for
the
purpose
of
getting
something
important
out
of
Mr
Winkle
in
cross
-
examination
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
did
get
anything
important
out
of
him
,
will
immediately
appear
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
Mr
Winkle
,
"
said
Mr
Phunky
,
"
that
Mr
Pickwick
is
not
a
young
man
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
;
"
old
enough
to
be
my
father
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
told
my
learned
friend
that
you
have
known
Mr
Pickwick
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
Had
you
ever
any
reason
to
suppose
or
believe
that
he
was
about
to
be
married
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
;
certainly
not
;
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
with
so
much
eagerness
,
that
Mr
Phunky
ought
to
have
got
him
out
of
the
box
with
all
possible
dispatch
.
 
<EOS>
Lawyers
hold
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
particularly
bad
witnesses
---
a
reluctant
witness
,
and
a
too
-
willing
witness
;
it
was
Mr
Winkle
's
fate
to
figure
in
both
characters
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
even
go
further
than
this
,
Mr
Winkle
,
"
continued
Mr
Phunky
,
in
a
most
smooth
and
complacent
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
see
anything
in
Mr
Pickwick
's
manner
and
conduct
towards
the
opposite
sex
,
to
induce
you
to
believe
that
he
ever
contemplated
matrimony
of
late
years
,
in
any
case
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
;
certainly
not
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Has
his
behaviour
,
when
females
have
been
in
the
case
,
always
been
that
of
a
man
,
who
,
having
attained
a
pretty
advanced
period
of
life
,
content
with
his
own
occupations
and
amusements
,
treats
them
only
as
a
father
might
his
daughters
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
the
least
doubt
of
it
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
,
in
the
fulness
of
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
---
yes
---
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
---
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
never
known
anything
in
his
behaviour
towards
Mrs
Bardell
,
or
any
other
female
,
in
the
least
degree
suspicious
?
"
said
Mr
Phunky
,
preparing
to
sit
down
;
for
Serjeant
Snubbin
was
winking
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
N
-
n
-
no
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
,
"
except
on
one
trifling
occasion
,
which
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
might
be
easily
explained
.
"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
if
the
unfortunate
Mr
Phunky
had
sat
down
when
Serjeant
Snubbin
had
winked
at
him
,
or
if
Serjeant
Buzfuz
had
stopped
this
irregular
cross
-
examination
at
the
outset
(
which
he
knew
better
than
to
do
;
observing
Mr
Winkle
's
anxiety
,
and
well
knowing
it
<EOS>
would
,
in
all
probability
,
lead
to
something
serviceable
to
him
)
,
this
unfortunate
admission
would
not
have
been
elicited
.
 
<EOS>
The
moment
the
words
fell
from
Mr
Winkle
's
lips
,
Mr
Phunky
sat
down
,
and
Serjeant
Snubbin
rather
hastily
told
him
he
might
leave
the
box
,
which
Mr
Winkle
prepared
to
do
with
great
readiness
,
when
Serjeant
Buzfuz
stopped
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
Mr
Winkle
,
stay
!
"
said
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
"
will
your
Lordship
have
the
goodness
to
ask
him
,
what
this
one
instance
of
suspicious
behaviour
towards
females
on
the
part
of
this
gentleman
,
who
is
old
enough
to
be
his
father
,
was
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
hear
what
the
learned
counsel
says
,
Sir
,
"
observed
the
judge
,
turning
to
the
miserable
and
agonised
Mr
Winkle
.
<EOS>
"
Describe
the
occasion
to
which
you
refer
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
Lord
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
trembling
with
anxiety
,
"
I
---
I
'd
rather
not
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
so
,
"
said
the
little
judge
;
"
but
you
must
.
"
   
<EOS>
Amid
the
profound
silence
of
the
whole
court
,
Mr
Winkle
faltered
out
,
that
the
trifling
circumstance
of
suspicion
was
Mr
Pickwick
's
being
found
in
a
lady
's
sleeping
-
apartment
at
midnight
;
which
had
terminated
,
he
believed
,
in
the
breaking
off
of
the
projected
marriage
of
the
lady
in
question
,
and
had
led
,
he
knew
,
to
the
whole
party
being
forcibly
carried
before
George
Nupkins
,
Esq
.
,
magistrate
and
justice
of
the
peace
,
for
the
borough
of
Ipswich
!
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
leave
the
box
,
Sir
,
"
said
Serjeant
Snubbin
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
did
leave
the
box
,
and
rushed
with
delirious
haste
to
the
George
and
Vulture
,
where
he
was
discovered
some
hours
after
,
by
the
waiter
,
groaning
in
a
hollow
and
dismal
manner
,
with
his
head
buried
beneath
the
sofa
cushions
.
   
<EOS>
Tracy
Tupman
,
and
Augustus
Snodgrass
,
were
severally
called
into
the
box
;
both
corroborated
the
testimony
of
their
unhappy
friend
;
and
each
was
driven
to
the
verge
of
desperation
by
excessive
badgering
.
<EOS>
Susannah
Sanders
was
then
called
,
and
examined
by
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
and
cross
-
examined
by
Serjeant
Snubbin
.
 
<EOS>
Had
always
said
and
believed
that
Pickwick
would
marry
Mrs
Bardell
;
knew
that
Mrs
Bardell
's
being
engaged
to
Pickwick
was
the
current
topic
of
conversation
in
the
neighbourhood
,
after
the
fainting
in
July
;
had
been
told
it
herself
by
Mrs
Mudberry
which
kept
a
mangle
,
and
Mrs
Bunkin
which
clear
-
starched
,
but
did
not
see
either
Mrs
Mudberry
or
Mrs
Bunkin
in
court
.
 
<EOS>
Had
heard
Pickwick
ask
the
little
boy
how
he
should
like
to
have
another
father
.
 
<EOS>
Did
not
know
that
Mrs
Bardell
was
at
that
time
keeping
company
with
the
baker
,
but
did
know
that
the
baker
was
then
a
single
man
and
is
now
married
.
 
<EOS>
Could
n't
swear
that
Mrs
Bardell
was
not
very
fond
of
the
baker
,
but
should
think
that
the
baker
was
not
very
fond
of
Mrs
Bardell
,
or
he
would
n't
have
married
somebody
else
.
 
<EOS>
Thought
Mrs
Bardell
fainted
away
on
the
morning
in
July
,
because
Pickwick
asked
her
to
name
the
day
:
knew
that
she
(
witness
)
fainted
away
stone
dead
when
Mr
Sanders
asked
her
to
name
the
day
,
and
believed
that
everybody
as
called
herself
a
lady
would
do
the
same
,
under
similar
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Heard
Pickwick
ask
the
boy
the
question
about
the
marbles
,
but
upon
her
oath
did
not
know
the
difference
between
an
"
alley
tor
"
and
a
"
commoney
.
"
   
<EOS>
By
the
COURT
.
<EOS>
---
During
the
period
of
her
keeping
company
with
Mr
Sanders
,
had
received
love
letters
,
like
other
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
their
correspondence
<EOS>
Mr
Sanders
had
often
called
her
a
"
duck
,
"
but
never
"
chops
,
"
nor
yet
"
tomato
sauce
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
particularly
fond
of
ducks
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
if
he
had
been
as
fond
of
chops
and
tomato
sauce
,
he
might
have
called
her
<EOS>
that
,
as
a
term
of
affection
.
   
<EOS>
Serjeant
Buzfuz
now
rose
with
more
importance
than
he
had
yet
exhibited
,
if
that
were
possible
,
and
vociferated
;
"
Call
Samuel
Weller
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
quite
unnecessary
to
call
Samuel
Weller
;
for
Samuel
Weller
stepped
briskly
into
the
box
the
instant
his
name
was
pronounced
;
and
placing
his
hat
on
the
floor
,
and
his
arms
on
the
rail
,
took
a
bird's
-
eye
view
of
the
Bar
,
and
a
comprehensive
survey
of
the
Bench
,
with
a
remarkably
cheerful
and
lively
aspect
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
your
name
,
sir
?
"
inquired
the
judge
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
Weller
,
my
Lord
,
"
replied
that
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
spell
it
with
a
"
V
"
or
a
"
W
"
?
"
inquired
the
judge
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
depends
upon
the
taste
and
fancy
of

replied
Sam
;
"
I
never
had
occasion
to
spell
it
more
than
once
or
twice
in
my
life

but
I
spells

with
a

"
   
Here
a
voice
in
the
gallery
exclaimed
aloud
,
"
Quite
right
too

Samivel

quite
right

Put

Who
is
that

who
dares
address
the
court

"
said
the
little
judge
,
looking
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
Usher
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
Lord

"
   
<EOS>
"
Bring
that
person
here
instantly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
Lord
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
as
the
usher
did
n't
find
the
person
,
he
did
n't
bring
him
;
and
,
after
a
great
commotion
,
all
the
people
who
had
got
up
to
look
for
the
culprit
,
sat
down
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
judge
turned
to
the
witness
as
soon
as
his
indignation
would
allow
him
to
speak
,
and
said
---
   
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
who
that
was
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
rayther
suspect
it
was
my
father
,
my
lord
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
him
here
now
?
"
said
the
judge
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
do
n't
,
my
Lord
,
"
replied
Sam
,
staring
right
up
into
the
lantern
at
the
roof
of
the
court
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
could
have
pointed
him
out
,
I
would
have
committed
him
instantly

"
said
the
judge
.
<EOS>
Sam
bowed
his
acknowledgments
and
turned
,
with
unimpaired
cheerfulness
of
countenance
,
towards
Serjeant
Buzfuz
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
Serjeant
Buzfuz
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
sir
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
are
in
the
service
of
Mr
Pickwick

the
defendant
in
this
case

<EOS>
Speak
up
,
if
you
please
,
Mr
Weller

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
speak
up

Sir

"
replied
Sam
;
"
I
am
in
the
service
o

that

ere
gen'l'man

and
a
wery
good
service
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Little
to
do
,
and
plenty
to
get
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
with
jocularity
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
quite
enough
to
get
,
Sir
,
as
the
soldier
said
ven
they
ordered
him
three
hundred
and
fifty
lashes
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
tell
us
what
the
soldier
,
or
any
other
man
,
said
,
Sir
,
"
interposed
the
judge
;
"
it
's
not
evidence
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
good
,
my
Lord
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
recollect
anything
particular
happening
on
the
morning
when
you
were
first
engaged
by
the
defendant
;
eh
,
Mr
Weller
?
"
said
Serjeant
Buzfuz
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
,
sir
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
the
goodness
to
tell
the
jury
what
it
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
a
reg'lar
new
fit
out
<EOS>
o
'
clothes
that
mornin
'
,
gen'l'men
of
the
jury
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
and
that
was
a
wery
partickler
and
uncommon
circumstance
vith
me
in
those
days
.
"
   
<EOS>
Hereupon
there
was
a
general
laugh
;
and
the
little
judge
,
looking
with
an
angry
countenance
over
his
desk
,
said
,
"
You
had
better
be
careful
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
Mr
Pickwick
said
at
the
time
,
my
Lord
,
"
replied
Sam
;
"
and
I
was
wery
careful
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
'
that
'
ere
suit
o
'
clothes
;
wery
careful
indeed
,
my
Lord
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
judge
looked
sternly
at
Sam
for
full
two
minutes
,
but
Sam
's
features
were
so
perfectly
calm
and
serene
that
the
judge
said
nothing
,
and
motioned
Serjeant
Buzfuz
to
proceed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
folding
his
arms
emphatically
,
and
turning
half
-
round
to
the
jury
,
as
if
in
mute
assurance
that
he
would
bother
the
witness
yet
---
"
<EOS>
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
,
Mr
Weller
,
that
you
saw
nothing
of
this
fainting
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff
in
the
arms
of
the
defendant
,
which
you
have
heard
described
by
the
witnesses
?
"
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
Sam
;
"
I
was
in
the
passage
till
they
called
me
up
,
and
then
the
old
lady
was
not
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
attend
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
dipping
a
large
pen
into
the
inkstand
before
him
,
for
the
purpose
of
frightening
Sam
with
a
show
of
taking
down
his
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
were
in
the
passage
,
and
yet
saw
nothing
of
what
was
going
forward
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
a
pair
of
eyes
,
Mr
Weller
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
a
pair
of
eyes
,
"
replied
Sam
,
"
and
that
's
just
it

<EOS>
If

<EOS>
At
this
answer
,
which
was
delivered
without
the
slightest
appearance
of
irritation
,
and
with
the
most
complete
simplicity
and
equanimity
of
manner
,
the
spectators
tittered
,
the
little
judge
smiled
,
and
Serjeant
Buzfuz
looked
particularly
foolish
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
short
consultation
with
Dodson
&
Fogg
,
the
learned
Serjeant
again
turned
towards
Sam
,
and
said
,
with
a
painful
effort
to
conceal
his
vexation
,
"
Now
,
Mr
Weller
,
I
'll
ask
you
a
question
on
another
point
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
Sir
,
"
rejoined
Sam
,
with
the
utmost
good
-
humour
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
going
up
to
Mrs
Bardell
's
house
,
one
night
in
November
last
?
"
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
wery
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
do
remember
that
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
recovering
his
spirits
;
"
I
thought
we
should
get
at
something
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
rayther
thought
that
,
too
,
sir
,
"
replied
Sam
;
and
at
this
the
spectators
tittered
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
;
I
suppose
you
went
up
to
have
a
little
talk
about
this
trial
---
eh
,
Mr
Weller
?
"
said
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
looking
knowingly
at
the
jury
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
went
up
to
pay
the
rent
;
but
we
did
get
a
-
talkin
'
about
the
trial
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
did
get
a
-
talking
about
the
trial
,
"
said
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
brightening
up
with
the
anticipation
of
some
important
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
what
passed
about
the
trial
;
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
tell
us
,
Mr
Weller
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Vith
all
the
pleasure
in
life

sir
<EOS>

replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Arter
a
few
unimportant
obserwations
from
the
two
wirtuous
females
as
has
been
examined
here
to

day
<EOS>

the
ladies
gets
into
a
very
great
state
o
'
admiration
at
the
honourable
conduct
of
Mr
Dodson
and
Fogg
---
them
two
gen'l'men
<EOS>
as
is
settin
'
near
you
now
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
,
of
course
,
drew
general
attention
to
Dodson
&
Fogg
,
who
looked
as
virtuous
as
possible
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
attorneys
for
the
plaintiff
,
"
said
Mr
Serjeant
Buzfuz
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
They
spoke
in
high
praise
of
the
honourable
conduct
of
Messrs.
Dodson
and
Fogg
,
the
attorneys
for
the
plaintiff
,
did
they
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
they
said
what
a
wery
gen'rous
thing
it
was
o
'
them
to
have
taken
up
the
case
on
spec
,
and
to
charge
nothing
at
all
for
costs
,
unless
they
got
'em
out
of
Mr
Pickwick
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
very
unexpected
reply
,
the
spectators
tittered
again
,
and
Dodson
&
Fogg
,
turning
very
red
,
leaned
over
to
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
and
in
a
hurried
manner
whispered
something
in
his
ear
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
right
,
"
said
Serjeant
Buzfuz
aloud
,
with
affected
composure
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
perfectly
useless
,
my
Lord
,
attempting
to
get
at
any
evidence
through
the
impenetrable
stupidity
of
this
witness
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
trouble
the
court
by
asking
him
any
more
questions
.
<EOS>
Stand
down
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
any
other
gen'l'man
like
to
ask
me
anythin
'
?
"
inquired
Sam
,
taking
up
his
hat
,
and
looking
round
most
deliberately
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
I
,
Mr
Weller
,
thank
you
,
"
said
Serjeant
Snubbin
,
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
go
down
,
sir
,
"
said
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
waving
his
hand
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
went
down
accordingly
,
after
doing
Messrs.
Dodson
&
Fogg
's
case
as
much
harm
as
he
conveniently
could
,
and
saying
just
as
little
respecting
Mr
Pickwick
as
might
be
,
which
was
precisely
the
object
he
had
had
in
view
all
along
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
objection
to
admit
,
my
Lord
,
"
said
Serjeant
Snubbin
,
"
if
it
will
save
the
examination
of
another
witness
,
that
Mr
Pickwick
has
retired
from
business
,
and
is
a
gentleman
of
considerable
independent
property
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
Serjeant
Buzfuz
,
putting
in
the
two
letters
to
be
read
,
"
then
that
's
my
case
,
my
Lord
.
"
   
<EOS>
Serjeant
Snubbin
then
addressed
the
jury
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
;
and
a
very
long
and
a
very
emphatic
address
he
delivered
,
in
which
he
bestowed
the
highest
possible
eulogiums
on
the
conduct
and
character
of
Mr
Pickwick
;
but
inasmuch
as
our
readers
are
far
better
able
to
form
a
correct
estimate
of
that
gentleman
's
merits
and
deserts
,
than
Serjeant
Snubbin
could
possibly
be
,
we
do
not
feel
called
upon
to
enter
at
any
length
into
the
learned
gentleman
's
observations
.
 
<EOS>
He
attempted
to
show
that
the
letters
which
had
been
exhibited
,
merely
related
to
Mr
Pickwick
's
dinner
,
or
to
the
preparations
for
receiving
him
in
his
apartments
on
his
return
from
some
country
excursion
.
<EOS>
It
is
sufficient
to
add
in
general
terms
,
that
he
did
the
best
he
could
for
Mr
Pickwick
;
and
the
best
,
as
everybody
knows
,
on
the
infallible
authority
of
the
old
adage
,
could
do
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Justice
Stareleigh
summed
up
,
in
the
old
-
established
and
most
approved
form
.
 
<EOS>
He
read
as
much
of
his
notes
to
the
jury
as
he
could
decipher
on
so
short
a
notice
,
and
made
running
-
comments
on
the
evidence
as
he
went
along
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mrs
Bardell
were
right
,
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
Mr
Pickwick
was
wrong
,
and
if
they
thought
the
evidence
of
Mrs
Cluppins
worthy
of
credence
they
would
believe
it
,
and
,
if
they
did
n't
,
why
,
they
would
n't
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
were
satisfied
that
a
breach
of
promise
of
marriage
had
been
committed
they
would
find
for
the
plaintiff
with
such
damages
as
they
thought
proper
;
and
if
,
on
the
other
hand
,
it
appeared
to
them
that
no
promise
of
marriage
had
ever
been
given
,
they
would
find
for
the
defendant
with
no
damages
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
jury
then
retired
to
their
private
room
to
talk
the
matter
over
,
and
the
judge
retired
to
HIS
private
room
,
to
refresh
himself
with
a
mutton
chop
and
a
glass
of
sherry
.
<EOS>
An
anxious
quarter
of
a
hour
elapsed
;
the
jury
came
back
;
the
judge
was
fetched
in
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
put
on
his
spectacles
,
and
gazed
at
the
foreman
with
an
agitated
countenance
and
a
quickly
-
beating
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
said
the
individual
in
black
,
"
are
you
all
agreed
upon
your
verdict
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
,
"
replied
the
foreman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
find
for
the
plaintiff
,
gentlemen
,
or
for
the
defendant
?
"
<EOS>
"
For
the
plaintiff
.
"
   
"
With
what
damages
,
gentlemen
?
"
   
"
Seven
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
took
off
his
spectacles
,
carefully
wiped
the
glasses
,
folded
them
into
their
case
,
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
;
then
,
having
drawn
on
his
gloves
with
great
nicety
,
and
stared
at
the
foreman
all
the
while
,
he
mechanically
followed
Mr
Perker
and
the
blue
bag
out
of
court
.
   
<EOS>
They
stopped
in
a
side
room
while
Perker
paid
the
court
fees
;
and
here
,
Mr
Pickwick
was
joined
by
his
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
too
,
he
encountered
Messrs.
Dodson
&
Fogg
,
rubbing
their
hands
with
every
token
of
outward
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
"
said
Dodson
,
for
self
and
partner
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
imagine
you
'll
get
your
costs
,
do
n't
you
,
gentlemen
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
Fogg
said
they
thought
it
rather
probable
.
 
<EOS>
Dodson
smiled
,
and
said
they
'd
try
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
try
,
and
try
,
and
try
again
,
Messrs.
Dodson
and
Fogg
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
vehemently
,
"
but
not
one
farthing
of
costs
or
damages
<EOS>
do
you
ever
get
from
me
,
if
I
spend
the
rest
of
my
existence
in
a
debtor
's
prison
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
ha
!
"
laughed
Dodson
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
think

We

grinned
Fogg

<EOS>
Speechless
with
indignation
<EOS>
,
Mr
Pickwick
allowed
himself
to
be
led
by
his
solicitor
and
friends
to
the
door
,
and
there
assisted
into
a
hackney
-
coach
,
which
had
been
fetched
for
the
purpose
,
by
the
ever
-
watchful
Sam
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
had
put
up
the
steps
,
and
was
preparing
to
jump
upon
the
box
,
when
he
felt
himself
gently
touched
on
the
shoulder
;
and
,
looking
round
,
his
father
stood
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
's
countenance
wore
a
mournful
expression
,
as
he
shook
his
head
gravely
,
and
said
,
in
warning
accents
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
know'd

In
which
Mr
Pickwick
thinks
he
had
better
go
to
Bath
;
and
goes
accordingly
 
"
But
surely
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
said
little
Perker
,
as
he
stood
in
Mr
Pickwick
's
apartment
on
the
morning
after
the
trial
,
"
surely
you
do
n't
really
mean
---
really
and
seriously
now
,
and
irritation
apart
---
that
you
wo
n't
pay
these
costs
and
damages
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
one
halfpenny

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
firmly
;
"
not
one
halfpenny
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hooroar
for
the
principle
,
as
the
money

lender
said
ven
<EOS>
he
vouldn't
renew
the

"
observed
Mr
Weller
,
who
was
clearing
away
the
breakfast
-
things
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
have
the
goodness
to
step
downstairs
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cert'nly
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
;
and
acting
on
Mr
Pickwick
's
gentle
hint
,
Sam
retired
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Perker
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
great
seriousness
of
manner
,
"
my
friends
here
have
endeavoured
to
dissuade
me
from
this
determination
,
but
without
avail
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
employ
myself
as
usual
,
until
the
opposite
party
have
the
power
of
issuing
a
legal
process
of
execution
against
me
;
and
if
they
are
vile
enough
to
avail
themselves
of
it
,
and
to
arrest
my
person
,
I
shall
yield
myself
up
with
perfect
cheerfulness
and
content
of
heart
.
 
<EOS>
When
can
they
do
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
can
issue
execution
,
my
dear
Sir
,
for
the
amount
of
the
damages
and
taxed
costs
,
next
term
,
"
replied
Perker
,
"
just
two
months
hence
,
my
dear
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Until
that
time
,
my
dear
fellow
,
let
me
hear
no
more
of
the
matter

<EOS>
And
now
,
"
continued
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
round
on
his
friends
with
a
good
-
humoured
smile
,
and
a
sparkle
in
the
eye
which
no
spectacles
could
dim
or
conceal
,
"
the
only
question
is
,
Where
shall
we
go
next
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
and
Mr
Snodgrass
were
too
much
affected
by
their
friend
's
heroism
to
offer
any
reply
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
had
not
yet
sufficiently
recovered
the
recollection
of
his
evidence
at
the
trial
,
to
make
any
observation
on
any
subject
,
so
Mr
Pickwick
paused
in
vain
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
that
gentleman
,
"
if
you
leave
me
to
suggest
our
destination
,
I
say
Bath
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
none
of
us
have
ever
been
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nobody
had
;
and
as
the
proposition
was
warmly
seconded
by
Perker
,
who
considered
it
extremely
probable
that
if
Mr
Pickwick
saw
a
little
change
and
gaiety
he
would
be
inclined
to
think
better
of
his
determination
,
and
worse
of
a
debtor
's
prison
,
it
was
carried
unanimously
;
and
Sam
was
at
once
despatched
to
the
White
Horse
Cellar
,
to
take
five
places
by
the
half
-
past
seven
o'clock
coach
,
next
morning
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
just
two
places
to
be
had
inside
,
and
just
three
to
be
had
out
;
so
Sam
Weller
booked
for
them
all
,
and
having
exchanged
a
few
compliments
with
the
booking
-
office
clerk
on
the
subject
of
a
pewter
half
-
crown
which
was
tendered
him
as
a
portion
of
his
"
change
,
"
walked
back
to
the
George
and
Vulture
,
where
he
was
pretty
busily
employed
until
bed
-
time
in
reducing
clothes
and
linen
into
the
smallest
possible
compass
,
and
exerting
his
mechanical
genius
in
constructing
a
variety
of
ingenious
devices
for
keeping
the
lids
on
boxes
which
had
neither
locks
nor
hinges
.
   
<EOS>
The
next
was
a
very
unpropitious
morning
for
a
journey
---
muggy
,
damp
,
and
drizzly
.
 
<EOS>
The
horses
in
the
stages
that
were
going
out
,
and
had
come
through
the
city
,
were
smoking
so
,
that
the
outside
passengers
were
invisible
.
 
<EOS>
The
newspaper
-
sellers
looked
moist
,
and
smelled
mouldy
;
the
wet
ran
off
the
hats
of
the
orange
-
vendors
as
they
thrust
their
heads
into
the
coach
windows
,
and
diluted
the
insides
in
a
refreshing
manner
.
 
<EOS>
The
Jews
with
the
fifty
-
bladed
penknives
shut
them
up
in
despair
;
the
men
with
the
pocket
-
books
made
pocket
-
books
of
them
.
<EOS>
Watch
-
guards
and
toasting
-
forks
were
alike
at
a
discount
,
and
pencil
-
cases
and
sponges
were
a
drug
in
the
market
.
   
<EOS>
Leaving
Sam
Weller
to
rescue
the
luggage
from
the
seven
or
eight
porters
who
flung
themselves
savagely
upon
it
,
the
moment
the
coach
stopped
,
and
finding
that
they
were
about
twenty
minutes
too
early
,
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
friends
went
for
shelter
into
the
travellers
"
room
---
the
last
resource
of
human
dejection
.
   
<EOS>
The
travellers
"
room
at
the
White
Horse
Cellar
is
of
course
uncomfortable
;
it
would
be
no
travellers
"
room
if
it
were
not
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
right
-
hand
parlour
,
into
which
an
aspiring
kitchen
fireplace
appears
to
have
walked
,
accompanied
by
a
rebellious
poker
,
tongs
,
and
shovel
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
divided
into
boxes
,
for
the
solitary
confinement
of
travellers
,
and
is
furnished
with
a
clock
,
a
looking
-
glass
,
and
a
live
waiter
,
which
latter
article
is
kept
in
a
small
kennel
for
washing
glasses
,
in
a
corner
of
the
apartment
.
   
<EOS>
One
of
these
boxes
was
occupied
,
on
this
particular
occasion
,
by
a
stern
-
eyed
man
of
about
five
-
and
-
forty
,
who
had
a
bald
and
glossy
forehead
,
with
a
good
deal
of
black
hair
at
the
sides
and
back
of
his
head
,
and
large
black
whiskers
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
in
a
brown
coat
;
and
had
a
large
sealskin
travelling
-
cap
,
and
a
greatcoat
and
cloak
,
lying
on
the
seat
beside
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
up
from
his
breakfast
as
Mr
Pickwick
entered
,
with
a
fierce
and
peremptory
air
,
which
was
very
dignified
;
and
,
having
scrutinised
that
gentleman
and
his
companions
to
his
entire
satisfaction
,
hummed
a
tune
,
in
a
manner
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
rather
suspected
somebody
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
him
,
but
it
would
n't
do
.
   
<EOS>
"
Waiter
,
"
said
the
gentleman
with
the
whiskers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
?
"
replied
a
man
with
a
dirty
complexion
,
and
a
towel
of
the
same
,
emerging
from
the
kennel
before
mentioned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Some
more
toast
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Buttered
toast
,
mind
,
"
said
the
gentleman
fiercely
.
   
<EOS>
"
Directly
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
waiter
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
with
the
whiskers
hummed
a
tune
in
the
same
manner
as
before
,
and
pending
the
arrival
of
the
toast
,
advanced
to
the
front
of
the
fire
,
and
,
taking
his
coat
tails
under
his
arms
,
looked
at
his
boots
and
ruminated
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whereabouts
in
Bath
this
coach
puts
up
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
mildly
addressing
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hum
---
<EOS>
eh
---
what
's
that
?
"
said
the
strange
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
made
an
observation
to
my
friend
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
always
ready
to
enter
into
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wondered
at
what
house
the
Bath
coach
put
up
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
can
inform
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
Bath
?
"
said
the
strange
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
those
other
gentlemen
?
"
   
"
They
are
going
also
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
inside
---
I
'll
be
damned
if
you
're
going
inside
,
"
said
the
strange
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
all
of
us
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
all
of
you
,
"
said
the
strange
man
emphatically
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
taken
two
places
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
try
to
squeeze
six
people
into
an
infernal
box
that
only
holds
four
,
I
'll
take
a
post
-
chaise
and
bring
an
action
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
paid
my
fare
.
 
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
do
;
I
told
the
clerk
when
I
took
my
places
that
it
would
n't
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
these
things
have
been
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
they
are
done
every
day
;
but
I
never
was
done
,
and
I
never
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
know
me
best
,
best
know
it
;
crush
me
!
"
<EOS>
Here
the
fierce
gentleman
rang
the
bell
with
great
violence
,
and
told
the
waiter
he
'd
better
bring
the
toast
in
five
seconds
,
or
he
'd
know
the
reason
why
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
good
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
you
will
allow
me
to
observe
that
this
is
a
very
unnecessary
display
of
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
taken
places
inside
for
two
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
said
the
fierce
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
withdraw
my
expressions
.
 
<EOS>
I
tender
an
apology
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
my
card
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
your
acquaintance

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
great
pleasure
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
to
be
fellow
-
travellers
,
and
I
hope
we
shall
find
each
other

society
mutually
agreeable

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
shall

said
the
fierce

.
 
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
Gentlemen

your

<EOS>
Know

"
   
<EOS>
Of
course
,
an
interchange
of
friendly
salutations
followed
this
gracious
speech
;
and
the
fierce
gentleman
immediately
proceeded
to
inform
the
friends
,
in
the
same
short
,
abrupt
,
jerking
sentences
,
that
his
name
was
Dowler
;
that
he
was
going
to
Bath
on
pleasure
;
that
he
was
formerly
in
the
army
;
that
he
had
now
set
up
in
business
as
a
gentleman
;
that
he
lived
upon
the
profits
;
and
that
the
individual
for
whom
the
second
place
was
taken
,
was
a
personage
no
less
illustrious
than
Mrs
Dowler
,
his
lady
wife
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
fine
woman
,
"
said
Mr
Dowler
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
proud
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
reason
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
judging
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
,
"
replied
Dowler
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
shall
know
you
.
 
<EOS>
She
shall
esteem
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
courted
her
under
singular
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
I
won
her
through
a
rash
vow
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
her
;
I
loved
her
;
I
proposed
;
she
refused
me
.
<EOS>
---
"
You
love
another
?
"
<EOS>
---
"
Spare
my
blushes
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
I
know
him
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
You
do
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
Very
good
;
if
he
remains
here
,
I
'll
skin
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
Lord
bless
me
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
involuntarily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
skin
the
gentleman
,
Sir
?
"
inquired
Mr
Winkle
,
with
a
very
pale
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wrote
him
a
note
,
I
said
it
was
a
painful
thing
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
it
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
interposed
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
said
I
had
pledged
my
word
as
a
gentleman
to
skin
him
.
 
<EOS>
My
character
was
at
stake
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
alternative
.
 
<EOS>
As
an
officer
in
His
Majesty
's
service
,
I
was
bound
to
skin
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
regretted
the
necessity
,
but
it
must
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
open
to
conviction
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
that
the
rules
of
the
service
were
imperative
.
 
<EOS>
He
fled
.
 
<EOS>
I
married
her
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
her
head
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Dowler
concluded
,
he
pointed
to
a
stage
which
had
just
driven
up
,
from
the
open
window
of
which
a
rather
pretty
face
in
a
bright
blue
bonnet
was
looking
among
the
crowd
on
the
pavement
,
most
probably
for
the
rash
man
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dowler
paid
his
bill
,
and
hurried
out
with
his
travelling
cap
,
coat
,
and
cloak
;
and
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
friends
followed
to
secure
their
places
.
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
and
Mr
Snodgrass
had
seated
themselves
at
the
back
part
of
the
coach
;
Mr
Winkle
had
got
inside
;
and
Mr
Pickwick
was
preparing
to
follow
him
,
when
Sam
Weller
came
up
to
his
master
,
and
whispering
in
his
ear
,
begged
to
speak
to
him
,
with
an
air
of
the
deepest
mystery
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
<EOS>
what
's
the
matter
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
rayther
a
rum
go
,
sir
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
here
,
Sir
,
"
rejoined
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
wery
much
afeerd
,
sir
,
that
the
properiator
o
'
<EOS>
this
here
coach
is
a
playin
'
some
imperence
vith
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
is
that
,
Sam
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
are
n't
the
names
down
on
the
way
-
bill
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
names
is
not
only
down
on
the
vay
-
bill
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Sam
,
"
but
they
've
painted
vun
on
'em
up
,
on
the
door
o
'
the
coach
.
"
<EOS>
As
Sam
spoke
,
he
pointed
to
that
part
of
the
coach
door
on
which
the
proprietor
's
name
usually
appears
;
and
there
,
sure
enough
,
in
gilt
letters
of
a
goodly
size
,
was
the
magic
name
of
PICKWICK
!
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
,
quite
staggered
by
the
coincidence
;
"
what
a
very
extraordinary
thing
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
that
ai
n't
all
,
"
said
Sam
,
again
directing
his
master
's
attention
to
the
coach
door
;
"
not
content
vith
writin
'
up
<EOS>
"
Pickwick
,
"
they
puts
"
Moses
"
afore
it
,
vich
I
call
addin
'
insult
to
injury
,
as
the
parrot
said
ven
they
not
only
took
him
from
his
native
land
,
but
made
him
talk
the
English
langwidge
arterwards
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
odd
enough
,
certainly
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
but
if
we
stand
talking
here
,
we
shall
lose
our
places
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
,
ai
n't
nothin'
to
be
done
in
consequence
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Sam
,
perfectly
aghast
at
the
coolness
with
which
Mr
Pickwick
prepared
to
ensconce
himself
inside
.
   
<EOS>
"
Done
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
should
be
done
?
"
<EOS>
"
Ai
n't
nobody
to
be
whopped
for
takin
'
this
here
liberty
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
who
had
expected
that
at
least
he
would
have
been
commissioned
to
challenge
the
guard
and
the
coachman
to
a
pugilistic
encounter
on
the
spot
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
eagerly
;
"
not
on
any
account
.
 
<EOS>
Jump
up
to
your
seat
directly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
wery
much
afeered
,
"
muttered
Sam
to
himself
,
as
he
turned
away
,
"
that
somethin'
queer
's
come
over
the
governor
,
or
he
'd
never
ha
'
stood
this
so
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
that
'
ere
trial
has
n't
broke
his
spirit
,
but
it
looks
bad
,
wery
bad
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
shook
his
head
gravely
;
and
it
is
worthy
of
remark
,
as
an
illustration
of
the
manner
in
which
he
took
this
circumstance
to
heart
,
that
he
did
not
speak
another
word
until
the
coach
reached
the
Kensington
turnpike
.
 
<EOS>
Which
was
so
long
a
time
for
him
to
remain
taciturn
,
that
the
fact
may
be
considered
wholly
unprecedented
.
   
<EOS>
Nothing
worthy
of
special
mention
occurred
during
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dowler
related
a
variety
of
anecdotes
,
all
illustrative
of
his
own
personal
prowess
and
desperation
,
and
appealed
to
Mrs
Dowler
in
corroboration
thereof
;
when
Mrs
Dowler
invariably
brought
in
,
in
the
form
of
an
appendix
,
some
remarkable
fact
or
circumstance
which
Mr
Dowler
had
forgotten
,
or
had
perhaps
through
modesty
,
omitted
;
for
the
addenda
in
every
instance
went
to
show
that
Mr
Dowler
was
even
a
more
wonderful
fellow
than
he
made
himself
out
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Winkle
listened
with
great
admiration
,
and
at
intervals
conversed
with
Mrs
Dowler
,
who
was
a
very
agreeable
and
fascinating
person
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
what
between
Mr
Dowler
's
stories
,
and
Mrs
Dowler
's
charms
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
's
good
-
humour
,
and
Mr
Winkle
's
good
listening
,
the
insides
contrived
to
be
very
companionable
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
The
outsides
did
as
outsides
always
do
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
very
cheerful
and
talkative
at
the
beginning
of
every
stage
,
and
very
dismal
and
sleepy
in
the
middle
,
and
very
bright
and
wakeful
again
towards
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
one
young
gentleman
in
an
India
-
rubber
cloak
,
who
smoked
cigars
all
day
;
and
there
was
another
young
gentleman
in
a
parody
upon
a
greatcoat
,
who
lighted
a
good
many
,
and
feeling
obviously
unsettled
after
the
second
whiff
,
threw
them
away
when
he
thought
nobody
was
looking
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
third
young
man
on
the
box
who
wished
to
be
learned
in
cattle
;
and
an
old
one
behind
,
who
was
familiar
with
farming
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
constant
succession
of
Christian
names
in
smock
-
frocks
and
white
coats
,
who
were
invited
to
have
a
"
lift
"
by
the
guard
,
and
who
knew
every
horse
and
hostler
on
the
road
and
off
it
;
and
there
was
a
dinner
which
would
have
been
cheap
at
half
-
a
-
crown
a
mouth
,
if
any
moderate
number
of
mouths
could
have
eaten
it
in
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
And
at
seven
o'clock
PM
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
friends
,
and
Mr
Dowler
and
his
wife
,
respectively
retired
to
their
private
sitting
-
rooms
at
the
White
Hart
Hotel
,
opposite
the
Great
Pump
Room
,
Bath
,
where
the
waiters
,
from
their
costume
,
might
be
mistaken
for
Westminster
boys
,
only
they
destroy
the
illusion
by
behaving
themselves
much
better
.
<EOS>
Breakfast
had
scarcely
been
cleared
away
on
the
succeeding
morning
,
when
a
waiter
brought
in
Mr
Dowler
's
card
,
with
a
request
to
be
allowed
permission
to
introduce
a
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dowler
at
once
followed
up
the
delivery
of
the
card
,
by
bringing
himself
and
the
friend
also
.
   
<EOS>
The
friend
was
a
charming
young
man
of
not
much
more
than
fifty
,
dressed
in
a
very
bright
blue
coat
with
resplendent
buttons
,
black
trousers
,
and
the
thinnest
possible
pair
of
highly
-
polished
boots
.
 
<EOS>
A
gold
eye
-
glass
was
suspended
from
his
neck
by
a
short
,
broad
,
black
ribbon
;
a
gold
snuff
-
box
was
lightly
clasped
in
his
left
hand
;
gold
rings
innumerable
glittered
on
his
fingers
;
and
a
large
diamond
pin
set
in
gold
glistened
in
his
shirt
frill
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
gold
watch
,
and
a
gold
curb
chain
with
large
gold
seals
;
and
he
carried
a
pliant
ebony
cane
with
a
gold
top
.
 
<EOS>
His
linen
was
of
the
very
whitest
,
finest
,
and
stiffest
;
his
wig
of
the
glossiest
,
blackest
,
and
curliest
.
 
<EOS>
His
snuff
was
princes
"
mixture
;
his
scent
BOUQUET
DU
ROI
.
 
<EOS>
His
features
were
contracted
into
a
perpetual
smile
;
and
his
teeth
were
in
such
perfect
order
that
it
was
difficult
at
a
small
distance
to
tell
the
real
from
the
false
.
   
<EOS>
"

Pickwick

said
Mr
Dowler
;
"

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
Re

"
   
<EOS>
Such
were
the
expressions
with
which
Angelo
Cyrus
Bantam
,
Esquire
,
M*C
,
took
Mr
Pickwick
's
hand
;
retaining
it
in
his
,
meantime
,
and
shrugging
up
his
shoulders
with
a
constant
succession
of
bows
,
as
if
he
really
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
the
trial
of
letting
it
go
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
very
long
time
since
I
drank
the
waters
,
certainly
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
for
,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
,
I
was
never
here
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never

exclaimed
the
Grand
Master
,
letting
the
hand
fall
in
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never

"
   
<EOS>
"
To
my
shame
,
I
must
say
that
I
am
perfectly
serious
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
really
never
was
here
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

"
exclaimed
the
Grand
Master
,
looking
extremely
pleased
;
"
yes

yes

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
Yes

we
know

Mr
Pickwick

we
know
you

"
   
<EOS>
"
The
reports
of
the
trial
in
those
confounded
papers
,
"
thought
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
have
heard
all
about
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
gentleman
residing
on
Clapham
Green
,
"
resumed
Bantam
,
"
who
lost
the
use
of
his
limbs
from
imprudently
taking
cold
after
port
wine
;
who
could
not
be
moved
in
consequence
of
acute
suffering
,
and
who
had
the
water
from
the
king
's
bath
bottled
at
one
hundred
and
three
degrees
,
and
sent
by
wagon
to
his
bedroom
in
town
,
where
he
bathed
,
sneezed
,
and
the
same
day
recovered
.
 
<EOS>
Very
remarkable
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
acknowledged
the
compliment
which
the
supposition
implied
,
but
had
the
self
-
denial
to
repudiate
it
,
notwithstanding
;
and
taking
advantage
of
a
moment
's
silence
on
the
part
of
the
M*C
,
begged
to
introduce
his
friends
,
Mr
Tupman
,
Mr
Winkle
,
and
Mr
Snodgrass
.
 
<EOS>
An
introduction
which
overwhelmed
the
M*C
 
with
delight
and
honour
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bantam
,
"
said
Mr
Dowler
,
"
Mr
Pickwick

<EOS>
They

"
   
<EOS>
"
The

be
at
the

Room
this
morning
at
two
o'clock

replied
the
M*C.
<EOS>
"
Will

<EOS>
"
I

"
rejoined
Dowler
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
long

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
I

"
   
<EOS>
"
This

a

night

said
the
M*C
,
again
taking
Mr

's
hand
,
as
he
rose
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
ball
-
nights
in
Ba
-
ath
<EOS>
are
moments
snatched
from
paradise
;
rendered
bewitching
by
music
,
beauty
,
elegance
,
fashion
,
etiquette
,
and
---
and
---
above
all
,
by
the
absence
of
tradespeople
,
who
are
quite
inconsistent
with
paradise
,
and
who
have
an
amalgamation
of
themselves
at
the
Guildhall
every
fortnight
,
which
is
,
to
say
the
least
,
remarkable
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
<EOS>
,
good
-
bye

"
<EOS>
and
protesting
all
the
way
downstairs
that
he
was
most
satisfied
,
and
most
delighted
,
and
most
overpowered
,
and
most
flattered
,
Angelo
Cyrus
Bantam
,
Esquire
,
M*C
,
stepped
into
a
very
elegant
chariot
that
waited
at
the
door
,
and
rattled
off
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
appointed
hour
,
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
friends
,
escorted
by
Dowler
,
repaired
to
the
Assembly
Rooms
,
and
wrote
their
names
down
in
the
book
---
an
instance
of
condescension
at
which
Angelo
Bantam
was
even
more
overpowered
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
Tickets
of
admission
to
that
evening
's
assembly
were
to
have
been
prepared
for
the
whole
party
,
but
as
they
were
not
ready
,
Mr
Pickwick
undertook
,
despite
all
the
protestations
to
the
contrary
of
Angelo
Bantam
,
to
send
Sam
for
them
at
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
to
the
M*C
's
house
in
Queen
Square
.
 
<EOS>
Having
taken
a
short
walk
through
the
city
,
and
arrived
at
the
unanimous
conclusion
that
Park
Street
was
very
much
like
the
perpendicular
streets
a
man
sees
in
a
dream
,
which
he
can
not
get
up
for
the
life
of
him
,
they
returned
to
the
White
Hart
,
and
despatched
Sam
on
the
errand
to
which
his
master
had
pledged
him
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
Weller
put
on
his
hat
in
a
very
easy
and
graceful
manner
,
and
,
thrusting
his
hands
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
,
walked
with
great
deliberation
to
Queen
Square
,
whistling
as
he
went
along
,
several
of
the
most
popular
airs
of
the
day
,
as
arranged
with
entirely
new
movements
for
that
noble
instrument
the
organ
,
either
mouth
or
barrel
.
 
<EOS>
Arriving
at
the
number
in
Queen
Square
to
which
he
had
been
directed
,
he
left
off
whistling
and
gave
a
cheerful
knock
,
which
was
instantaneously
answered
by
a
powdered
-
headed
footman
in
gorgeous
livery
,
and
of
symmetrical
stature
.
   
<EOS>
"
is
this
here
<EOS>
Mr
Bantam
's
,
old
feller
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Sam
Weller
,
nothing
abashed
by
the
blaze
of
splendour
which
burst
upon
his
sight
in
the
person
of
the
powdered
-
headed
footman
with
the
gorgeous
livery
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
young
man
?
<EOS>
"
was
the
haughty
inquiry
of
the
powdered
-
headed
footman
.
   
<EOS>
"
'Cos
if
it
is
,
jist
you
step
in
to
him
with
that

ere
card

and
say
Mr
Veller
's
a

waitin
'
<EOS>
,
will
you

"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
And
saying
it
,
he
very
coolly
walked
into
the
hall
,
and
sat
down
.
   
<EOS>
The
powdered

headed
footman
slammed
the
door
very
hard
,
and
scowled
very
grandly
;
but
both
the
slam
and
the
scowl
were
lost
upon
Sam
,
who
was
regarding
a
mahogany
umbrella
-
stand
with
every
outward
token
of
critical
approval
.
   
<EOS>
Apparently
his
master
's
reception
of
the
card
had
impressed
the
powdered
-
headed
footman
in
Sam
's
favour
,
for
when
he
came
back
from
delivering
it
,
he
smiled
in
a
friendly
manner
,
and
said
that
the
answer
would
be
ready
directly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
good
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
the
old
gen'l'm'n
not

put
himself
in
a
perspiration

<EOS>
No

I

had
my

<EOS>
"
You
dine
early

sir

said
the
powdered

headed
footman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
find
I
gets
on
better
at
supper
when
I
does
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
been
long
in
Bath
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
powdered
-
headed
footman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
of
you
before
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
created
any
wery
surprisin
'
sensation
here
,
as
yet

"
rejoined
Sam
,
"
for
me
and
the
other
fash'nables
only
come
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nice
place
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
powdered
-
headed
footman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Seems
so
,
"
observed
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pleasant
society
,
sir
,
"
remarked
the
powdered
-
headed
footman
.
<EOS>
"
Very
agreeable
servants
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
they
wos

replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Affable
,
unaffected

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
very
much
so
,
indeed
,
sir
,
"
said
the
powdered
-
headed
footman
,
taking
Sam
's
remarks
as
a
high
compliment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
much
so
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
do
anything
in
this
way
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
tall
footman
,
producing
a
small
snuff
-
box
with
a
fox
's
head
on
the
top
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
without
sneezing
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
IS
difficult
,
sir
,
I
confess
,
"
said
the
tall
footman
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
done
by
degrees
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
Coffee
is
the
best
practice
.
 
<EOS>
I
carried
coffee
,
Sir
,
for
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
looks
very
like
rappee
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
,
a
sharp
peal
at
the
bell
reduced
the
powdered
-
headed
footman
to
the
ignominious
necessity
of
putting
the
fox
's
head
in
his
pocket
,
and
hastening
with
a
humble
countenance
to
Mr
Bantam
's
"
study
.
"
 
<EOS>
By
the
bye
,
who
ever
knew
a
man
who
never
read
or
wrote
either
,
who
had
n't
got
some
small
back
parlour
which
he
WOULD
call
a
study
!
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
the
answer
,
sir
,
"
said
the
powdered
-
headed
footman
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
you
'll
find
it
inconveniently
large
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mention
it
,
"
said
Sam
,
taking
a
letter
with
a
small
enclosure
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
just
possible
as
exhausted
natur
"
may
manage
to
surwive
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
shall
meet
again
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
powdered
-
headed
footman
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
and
following
Sam
out
to
the
door
-
step
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
wery
obligin
'
,
sir
,
"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
do
n't
allow
yourself
to
be
fatigued
beyond
your
powers
;
there
's
a
amiable
bein

.
 
<EOS>
Consider
what
you
owe
to
society
,
and
do
n't
let
yourself
be
injured
by
too
much
work
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
sake
o

your
feller
-
creeturs
,
keep
yourself
as
quiet
as
you
can
;
only
think
what
a

"
<EOS>
With
these
pathetic
words
,
Sam
Weller
departed
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
very
singular
young
man
that
,
"
said
the
powdered
-
headed
footman
,
looking
after
Mr
Weller
,
with
a
countenance
which
clearly
showed
he
could
make
nothing
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
said
nothing
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
winked
,
shook
his
head
,
smiled
,
winked
again
;
<EOS>
and
,
with
an
expression
of
countenance
which
seemed
to
denote
that
he
was
greatly
amused
with
something
or
other
,
walked
merrily
away
.
   
<EOS>
At
precisely
twenty
minutes
before
eight
o'clock
that
night
,
Angelo
Cyrus
Bantam
,
Esq
.
,
the
Master
of
the
Ceremonies
,
emerged
from
his
chariot
at
the
door
of
the
Assembly
Rooms
in
the
same
wig
,
the
same
teeth
,
the
same
eye
-
glass
,
the
same
watch
and
seals
,
the
same
rings
,
the
same
shirt
-
pin
,
and
the
same
cane
.
<EOS>
The
only
observable
alterations
in
his
appearance
were
,
that
he
wore
a
brighter
blue
coat
,
with
a
white
silk
lining
,
black
tights
,
black
silk
stockings
,
and
pumps
,
and
a
white
waistcoat
,
and
was
,
if
possible
,
just
a
thought
more
scented
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
attired
,
the
Master
of
the
Ceremonies
,
in
strict
discharge
of
the
important
duties
of
his
all
-
important
office
,
planted
himself
in
the
room
to
receive
the
company
.
   
<EOS>
Bath
being
full
,
the
company
,
and
the
sixpences
for
tea
,
poured
in
,
in
shoals
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
ballroom
,
the
long
card
-
room
,
the
octagonal
card
-
room
,
the
staircases
,
and
the
passages
,
the
hum
of
many
voices
,
and
the
sound
of
many
feet
,
were
perfectly
bewildering
.
 
<EOS>
Dresses
rustled
,
feathers
waved
,
lights
shone
,
and
jewels
sparkled
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
music
---
not
of
the
quadrille
band
,
for
it
had
not
yet
commenced
;
but
the
music
of
soft
,
tiny
footsteps
,
with
now
and
then
a
clear
,
merry
laugh
---
low
and
gentle
,
but
very
pleasant
to
hear
in
a
female
voice
,
whether
in
Bath
or
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
Brilliant
eyes
,
lighted
up
with
pleasurable
expectation
,
gleamed
from
every
side
;
and
,
look
where
you
would
,
some
exquisite
form
glided
gracefully
through
the
throng
,
and
was
no
sooner
lost
,
than
it
was
replaced
by
another
as
dainty
and
bewitching
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
tea
-
room
,
and
hovering
round
the
card
-
tables
,
were
a
vast
number
of
queer
old
ladies
,
and
decrepit
old
gentlemen
,
discussing
all
the
small
talk
and
scandal
of
the
day
,
with
a
relish
and
gusto
which
sufficiently
bespoke
the
intensity
of
the
pleasure
they
derived
from
the
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
Mingled
with
these
groups
,
were
three
or
four
match
-
making
mammas
,
appearing
to
be
wholly
absorbed
by
the
conversation
in
which
they
were
taking
part
,
but
failing
not
from
time
to
time
to
cast
an
anxious
sidelong
glance
upon
their
daughters
,
who
,
remembering
the
maternal
injunction
to
make
the
best
use
of
their
youth
,
had
already
commenced
incipient
flirtations
in
the
mislaying
scarves
,
putting
on
gloves
,
setting
down
cups
,
and
so
forth
;
slight
matters
apparently
,
but
which
may
be
turned
to
surprisingly
good
account
by
expert
practitioners
.
   
<EOS>
Lounging
near
the
doors
,
and
in
remote
corners
,
were
various
knots
of
silly
young
men
,
displaying
various
varieties
of
puppyism
and
stupidity
;
amusing
all
sensible
people
near
them
with
their
folly
and
conceit
;
and
happily
thinking
themselves
the
objects
of
general
admiration
---
a
wise
and
merciful
dispensation
which
no
good
man
will
quarrel
with
.
   
<EOS>
And
lastly
,
seated
on
some
of
the
back
benches
,
where
they
had
already
taken
up
their
positions
for
the
evening
,
were
divers
unmarried
ladies
past
their
grand
climacteric
,
who
,
not
dancing
because
there
were
no
partners
for
them
,
and
not
playing
cards
lest
they
should
be
set
down
as
irretrievably
single
,
were
in
the
favourable
situation
of
being
able
to
abuse
everybody
without
reflecting
on
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
they
could
abuse
everybody
,
because
everybody
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
scene
of
gaiety
,
glitter
,
and
show
;
of
richly
-
dressed
people
,
handsome
mirrors
,
chalked
floors
,
girandoles
and
wax
-
candles
;
and
in
all
parts
of
the
scene
,
gliding
from
spot
to
spot
in
silent
softness
,
bowing
obsequiously
to
this
party
,
nodding
familiarly
to
that
,
and
smiling
complacently
on
all
,
was
the
sprucely
-
attired
person
of
Angelo
Cyrus
Bantam
,
Esquire
,
the
Master
of
the
Ceremonies
.
   
<EOS>
"

said
Mr
Dowler
,
in
a
loud
voice
,
directing
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
advanced
at
the
head
of
the
little
party
,
with
Mrs
Dowler
on
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
Into
the
tea
-
room
Mr
Pickwick
turned
;
and
catching
sight
of
him
,
Mr
Bantam
corkscrewed
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
welcomed
him
with
ecstasy
.
   
<EOS>
"

Mr

"

inquired
the

Mr

,
after
a
short
pause
,
during
which
young
Lord
Mutanhed
had
been
endeavouring
to
stare
Mr
Pickwick
out
of
countenance
,
and
Mr

had
been
reflecting
what
subject
his
Lordship
could
talk
about
best

<EOS>
"
Dear

At
this
anecdote
his
Lordship
laughed
very
heartily

as
did
the
listeners

of
course
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
drawing
his
arm
through
that
of
the
obsequious
Mr

Lord

walked
away

<EOS>
"
Delightful

So

rejoined
Mr

drily
.
   
<EOS>
The
dancing
having
commenced
,
the
necessary
introductions
having
been
made
,
and
all
preliminaries
arranged
,
Angelo
Bantam
rejoined
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
led
him
into
the
card
-
room
.
   
<EOS>
Just
at
the
very
moment
of
their
entrance
,
the
Dowager
Lady
Snuphanuph
and
two
other
ladies
of
an
ancient
and
whist
-
like
appearance
,
were
hovering
over
an
unoccupied
card
-
table
;
and
they
no
sooner
set
eyes
upon
Mr
Pickwick
under
the
convoy
of
Angelo
Bantam
,
than
they
exchanged
glances
with
each
other
,
seeing
that
he
was
precisely
the
very
person
they
wanted
,
to
make
up
the
rubber
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My

Bantam

said
the
Dowager

Snuphanuph
coaxingly
,
"
find

up
this

there

<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
happened
to
be
looking
another
way
at
the
moment
,
so
her
Ladyship
nodded
her
head
towards
him
,
and
frowned
expressively
.
   
<EOS>
"
My

Mr
Pickwick
bowed
to
each
of
the
ladies
,
and
,
finding
escape
impossible
,
cut
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
and
Miss
Bolo
against
Lady
Snuphanuph
and
Mrs
Colonel
Wugsby
.
<EOS>
As
the
trump
card
was
turned
up
,
at
the
commencement
of
the
second
deal
,
two
young
ladies
hurried
into
the
room
,
and
took
their
stations
on
either
side
of
Mrs
Colonel
Wugsby
's
chair
,
where
they
waited
patiently
until
the
hand
was
over
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now

Jane

"
said
Mrs
Colonel
Wugsby
,
turning
to
one
of
the
girls
,
"
what
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
came
to
ask
,
ma
,
whether
I
might
dance
with
the
youngest
Mr
Crawley
,
"
whispered
the
prettier
and
younger
of
the
two
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
God
,
Jane
,
how
can
you
think
of
such
things
?
"
replied
the
mamma
indignantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
n't
you
repeatedly
heard
that
his
father
has
eight
hundred
a
year
,
which
dies
with
him
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
ashamed
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
Not
on
any
account
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ma
,
"
whispered
the
other
,
who
was
much
older
than
her
sister
,
and
very
insipid
and
artificial
,
"
Lord
Mutanhed
has
been
introduced
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
I
thought
I
was
n't
engaged
,
ma

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
sweet
pet
,
my
love
,
"
replied
Mrs
Colonel
Wugsby
,
tapping
her
daughter
's
cheek
with
her
fan
,
"
and
are
always
to
be
trusted
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
immensely
rich
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
With
these
words
Mrs
Colonel
Wugsby
kissed
her
eldest
daughter
most
affectionately
,
and
frowning
in
a
warning
manner
upon
the
other
,
sorted
her
cards
.
   
<EOS>
Poor
Mr
Pickwick
!
<EOS>
he
had
never
played
with
three
thorough
-
paced
female
card
-
players
before
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
so
desperately
sharp
,
that
they
quite
frightened
him
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
played
a
wrong
card
,
Miss
Bolo
looked
a
small
armoury
of
daggers
;
if
he
stopped
to
consider
which
was
the
right
one
,
Lady
Snuphanuph
would
throw
herself
back
in
her
chair
,
and
smile
with
a
mingled
glance
of
impatience
and
pity
to
Mrs
Colonel
Wugsby
,
at
which
Mrs
Colonel
Wugsby
would
shrug
up
her
shoulders
,
and
cough
,
as
much
as
to
say
she
wondered
whether
he
ever
would
begin
.
<EOS>
Then
,
at
the
end
of
every
hand
,
Miss
Bolo
would
inquire
with
a
dismal
countenance
and
reproachful
sigh
,
why
Mr
Pickwick
had
not
returned
that
diamond
,
or
led
the
club
,
or
roughed
the
spade
,
or
finessed
the
heart
,
or
led
through
the
honour
,
or
brought
out
the
ace
,
or
played
up
to
the
king
,
or
some
such
thing
;
and
in
reply
to
all
these
grave
charges
,
Mr
Pickwick
would
be
wholly
unable
to
plead
any
justification
whatever
,
having
by
this
time
forgotten
all
about
the
game
.
 
<EOS>
People
came
and
looked
on
,
too
,
which
made
Mr
Pickwick
nervous
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
all
this
,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
distracting
conversation
near
the
table
,
between
Angelo
Bantam
and
the
two
Misses
Matinter
,
who
,
being
single
and
singular
,
paid
great
court
to
the
Master
of
the
Ceremonies
,
in
the
hope
of
getting
a
stray
partner
now
and
then
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
things
,
combined
with
the
noises
and
interruptions
of
constant
comings
in
and
goings
out
,
made
Mr
Pickwick
play
rather
badly
;
the
cards
were
against
him
,
also
;
and
when
they
left
off
at
ten
minutes
past
eleven
,
Miss
Bolo
rose
from
the
table
considerably
agitated
,
and
went
straight
home
,
in
a
flood
of
tears
and
a
sedan
-
chair
.
   
<EOS>
Being
joined
by
his
friends
,
who
one
and
all
protested
that
they
had
scarcely
ever
spent
a
more
pleasant
evening
,
Mr
Pickwick
accompanied
them
to
the
White
Hart
,
and
having
soothed
his
feelings
with
something
hot
,
went
to
bed
,
and
to
sleep
,
almost
simultaneously
.

The
chief
features
of
which
will
be
found
to
be
an
authentic
version
of
the
Legend
of
Prince
Bladud
,
and
a
most
extraordinary
calamity
that
befell
Mr
Winkle
 
<EOS>
As
Mr
Pickwick
contemplated
a
stay
of
at
least
two
months
in
Bath
,
he
deemed
it
advisable
to
take
private
lodgings
for
himself
and
friends
for
that
period
;
and
as
a
favourable
opportunity
offered
for
their
securing
,
on
moderate
terms
,
the
upper
portion
of
a
house
in
the
Royal
Crescent
,
which
was
larger
than
they
required
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Dowler
offered
to
relieve
them
of
a
bedroom
and
sitting
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
This
proposition
was
at
once
accepted
,
and
in
three
days
"
time
they
were
all
located
in
their
new
abode
,
when
Mr
Pickwick
began
to
drink
the
waters
with
the
utmost
assiduity
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
took
them
systematically
.
 
<EOS>
He
drank
a
quarter
of
a
pint
before
breakfast
,
and
then
walked
up
a
hill
;
and
another
quarter
of
a
pint
after
breakfast
,
and
then
walked
down
a
hill
;
and
,
after
every
fresh
quarter
of
a
pint
,
Mr
Pickwick
declared
,
in
the
most
solemn
and
emphatic
terms
,
that
he
felt
a
great
deal
better
;
whereat
his
friends
were
very
much
delighted
,
though
they
had
not
been
previously
aware
that
there
was
anything
the
matter
with
him
.

The
Great
Pump
Room
is
a
spacious
saloon
,
ornamented
with
Corinthian
pillars
,

a

,
and
a
Tompion

,
and
a
statue
of
Nash
,
and
a
golden
inscription
,
to
which
all
the
water

drinkers
should
attend
,
for
it
appeals
to
them
in
the
cause
of
a
deserving
charity
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
large
bar
with
a
marble
vase
,
out
of
which
the
pumper
gets
the
water
;
and
there
are
a
number
of
yellow

looking
tumblers
,
out
of
which
the

get
it
;

it
is
a
most
edifying

satisfactory
sight
to
behold
the
perseverance

gravity
with
which
they
swallow
it

There
are
baths
near
at
hand

in
which
a
part
of
the
company
wash
themselves
;
and
a
band
plays
afterwards
,
to
congratulate
the
remainder
on
their
having
done
so
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
another
pump
room
,
into
which
infirm
ladies
and
gentlemen
are
wheeled
,
in
such
an
astonishing
variety
of
chairs

chaises
,
that
any
adventurous
individual
who
goes
in
with
the
regular

of
toes

is
in
imminent
danger
of
coming
out
without
them
;
and
there
is
a
third

into
which
the
quiet
people
go

<EOS>
for
it

There

an
immensity

a
great
deal
of
conversation

and
liveliness
,
and
pleasantry
.
   
<EOS>
Every
morning
,
the
regular
water
-
drinkers
,
Mr
Pickwick
among
the
number
,
met
each
other
in
the
pump
room
,
took
their
quarter
of
a
pint

and
walked
constitutionally

At

After

After

After

they
went

If
it
were

perhaps
they
met
at

theatre
;
if
it

they
met
at

if

they
met

<EOS>
A
very
pleasant
routine
,
with
perhaps
a
slight

of
sameness
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
sitting
up
by
himself
,
after
a
day
spent
in
this
manner
,
making
entries
in
his
journal
,
his
friends
having
retired
to
bed
,
when
he
was
roused
by
a
gentle
tap
at
the
room
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Beg
your
pardon
,
Sir

"
said
Mrs
Craddock
,
the
landlady
,
peeping
in
;
"
but
did
you
want
anything
more
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
more

"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
young

is
gone
to
bed
,
Sir

"
said
Mrs
Craddock
;
"
and
Mr
Dowler
is
good
enough
to
say
that
he
'll
sit
up
for
Mrs
Dowler
,
as
the
party
is
n't
expected
to
be
over
till
late
<EOS>

so
I
was
thinking
that
if
you
wanted
nothing
more

Mr

,
I
would
go
to
bed

"
   
<EOS>
"
By

Mrs

closed

Mr

resumed
his
writing

In
half
an
hour

the

were
concluded

<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
carefully
rubbed
the

on
the
blotting

paper
,
shut
up
the
book
,
wiped
his
pen
on
the
bottom
of
the
inside
of
his
coat
tail
,
and
opened
the
drawer
of
the
inkstand
to
put
it
carefully
away
.
<EOS>
There
were
a
couple
of
sheets
of
writing

paper
,
pretty
closely
written
over
,
in
the
inkstand
drawer
,
and
they
were
folded
so
,
that
the
title

which
was
in
a
good
round

,
was
fully
disclosed
to
him

Seeing
from
this

that
it
was
no
private

as
it
seemed
to
relate
to
Bath

was
very
short

Mr
Pickwick
unfolded
it

lighted
his
bedroom
candle

THE
TRUE
LEGEND
OF
PRINCE
BLADUD
   
<EOS>
"
Less
than
two
hundred
years
ago
,
on
one
of
the
public
baths
in
this
city
,
there
appeared
an
inscription
in
honour
of
its
mighty
founder
,
the
renowned
Prince
Bladud
.
 
<EOS>
That
inscription
is
now
erased
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
many
hundred
years
before
that
time
,
there
had
been
handed
down
,
from
age
to
age
,
an
old
legend
,
that
the
illustrious
prince
being
afflicted
with
leprosy
,
on
his
return
from
reaping
a
rich
harvest
of
knowledge
in
Athens
,
shunned
the
court
of
his
royal
father
,
and
consorted
moodily
with
husbandman
and
pigs
.
<EOS>
Among
the
herd
(
so
said
the
legend
)
was
a
pig
of
grave
and
solemn
countenance
,
with
whom
the
prince
had
a
fellow
-
feeling
 
---
for
he
too
was
wise
---
a
pig
of
thoughtful
and
reserved
demeanour
;
an
animal
superior
to
his
fellows
,
whose
grunt
was
terrible
,
and
whose
bite
was
sharp
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
prince
sighed
deeply
as
he
looked
upon
the
countenance
of
the
majestic
swine
;
he
thought
of
his
royal
father
,
and
his
eyes
were
bedewed
with
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
sagacious
pig
was
fond
of
bathing
in
rich
,
moist
mud
.
<EOS>
Not
in
summer
,
as
common
pigs
do
now
,
to
cool
themselves
,
and
did
even
in
those
distant
ages
(
which
is
a
proof
that
the
light
of
civilisation
had
already
begun
to
dawn
,
though
feebly
)
,
but
in
the
cold
,
sharp
days
of
winter
.
 
<EOS>
His
coat
was
ever
so
sleek
,
and
his
complexion
so
clear
,
that
the
prince
resolved
to
essay
the
purifying
qualities
of
the
same
water
that
his
friend
resorted
to
.
<EOS>
He
made
the
trial
.
 
<EOS>
Beneath
that
black
mud
,
bubbled
the
hot
springs
of
Bath
.
 
<EOS>
He
washed
,
and
was
cured
.
 
<EOS>
Hastening
to
his
father
's
court
,
he
paid
his
best
respects
,
and
returning
quickly
hither
,
founded
this
city
and
its
famous
baths
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
sought
the
pig
with
all
the
ardour
of
their
early
friendship
 
---
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
the
waters
had
been
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
imprudently
taken
a
bath
at
too
high
a
temperature
,
and
the
natural
philosopher
was
no
more
!
 
<EOS>
He
was
succeeded
by
Pliny
,
who
also
fell
a
victim
to
his
thirst
for
knowledge
.

This
was
the
legend

Listen
to
the
true
one

A
great
many
centuries

flourished

in
great
state

the
famous
and
renowned
Lud
Hudibras

king
of
Britain
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
mighty
monarch
.
 
<EOS>
The
earth
shook
when
he
walked
---
he
was
so
very
stout
.
 
<EOS>
His
people
basked
in
the
light
of
his
countenance
---
it
was
so
red
and
glowing
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
,
indeed
,
every
inch
a
king
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
were
a
good
many
inches
of
him
,
too
,
for
although
he
was
not
very
tall
,
he
was
a
remarkable
size
round
,
and
the
inches
that
he
wanted
in
height
,
he
made
up
in
circumference
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
degenerate
monarch
of
modern
times
could
be
in
any
way
compared
with
him

I
should
say
the
venerable
King
Cole
would
be
that
illustrious
potentate

This
good

a

eighteen

Bladud

He
was
sent
to
a
preparatory
seminary
in
his
father

dominions
until
he
was
ten
years
old

and
was
then
despatched
,
in
charge
of
a
trusty
messenger
,
to
a
finishing
school
at
Athens
;
and
as
there
was
no
extra
charge
for
remaining
during
the
holidays
,
and
<EOS>
no
notice
required
previous
to
the
removal
of
a
pupil
,
there
he
remained
for
eight
long
years
,
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
,
the
king
his
father
sent
the
lord
chamberlain
over
,
to
settle
the
bill
,
and
to
bring
him
home

which
,
the
lord
chamberlain
doing

was
received
with
shouts

pensioned
immediately

prince
his
son
,
and
found
he
had
grown
up
such
a
fine
young
man
,
he
perceived
what
a
grand
thing
it
would
be
to
have
him
married
without
delay
,
so
that
his
children
might
be
the
means
of
perpetuating
the
glorious
race
of
Lud
,
down
to
the
very
latest
ages
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
he
sent
a
special
embassy
,
composed
of
great
noblemen
who
had
nothing
particular
to
do
,
and
wanted
lucrative
employment
,
to
a
neighbouring
king
,
and
demanded
his
fair
daughter
in
marriage
for
his
son
;
stating
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
anxious
to
be
on
the
most
affectionate
terms
with
his
brother
and
friend
,
but
that
if
they
could
n't
agree
in
arranging
this
marriage
,
he
should
be
under
the
unpleasant
necessity
of
invading
his
kingdom
and
putting
his
eyes
out
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
,
the
other
king
(
who
was
the
weaker
of
the
two
)
replied
that
he
was
very
much
obliged
to
his
friend
and
brother
for
all
his
goodness
and
magnanimity
,
and
that
his
daughter
was
quite
ready
to
be
married
,
whenever
Prince
Bladud
liked
to
come
and
fetch
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
answer
no
sooner
reached
Britain
,
than
the
whole
nation
was
transported
with
joy
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
was
heard
,
on
all
sides
,
but
the
sounds
of
feasting
and
revelry
---
except
the
chinking
of
money
as
it
was
paid
in
by
the
people
to
the
collector
of
the
royal
treasures
,
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
happy
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
upon
this
occasion
that
King
Lud
,
seated
on
the
top
of
his
throne
in
full
council
,
rose
,
in
the
exuberance
of
his
feelings
,
and
commanded
the
lord
chief
justice
to
order
in
the
richest
wines
and
the
court
minstrels
---
an
act
of
graciousness
which
has
been
,
through
the
ignorance
of
traditionary
historians
,
attributed
to
King
Cole
,
in
those
celebrated
lines
in
which
his
Majesty
is
represented
as
     
Calling
for
his
pipe
,
and
calling
for
his
pot
,
     
And
calling
for
his
fiddlers
three
.
   
<EOS>
Which
is
an
obvious
injustice
to
the
memory
of
King
Lud
,
and
a
dishonest
exaltation
of
the
virtues
of
King
Cole
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
,
in
the
midst
of
all
this
festivity
and
rejoicing
,
there
was
one
individual
present
,
who
tasted
not
when
the
sparkling
wines
were
poured
forth
,
and
who
danced
not
,
when
the
minstrels
played
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
no
other
than
Prince
Bladud
himself
,
in
honour
of
whose
happiness
a
whole
people
were
,
at
that
very
moment
,
straining
alike
their
throats
and
purse
-
strings
.
 
<EOS>
The
truth
was
,
that
the
prince
,
forgetting
the
undoubted
right
of
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
to
fall
in
love
on
his
behalf
,
had
,
contrary
to
every
precedent
of
policy
and
diplomacy
,
already
fallen
in
love
on
his
own
account
,
and
privately
contracted
himself
unto
the
fair
daughter
of
a
noble
Athenian
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
we
have
a
striking
example
of
one
of
the
manifold
advantages
of
civilisation
and
refinement
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
prince
had
lived
in
later
days
,
he
might
at
once
have
married
the
object
of
his
father
's
choice
,
and
then
set
himself
seriously
to
work
,
to
relieve
himself
of
the
burden
which
rested
heavily
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
have
endeavoured
to
break
her
heart
by
a
systematic
course
of
insult
and
neglect
;
or
,
if
the
spirit
of
her
sex
,
and
a
proud
consciousness
of
her
many
wrongs
had
upheld
her
under
this
ill
-
treatment
,
he
might
have
sought
to
take
her
life
,
and
so
get
rid
of
her
effectually
.
<EOS>
But
neither
mode
of
relief
suggested
itself
to
Prince
Bladud
;
so
he
solicited
a
private
audience
,
and
told
his
father
.
   
<EOS>
"
it
is
an
old
prerogative
of
kings
to
govern
everything
but
their
passions
.
 
<EOS>
King
Lud
flew
into
a
frightful
rage
,
tossed
his
crown
up
to
the
ceiling
,
and
caught
it
again
---
for
in
those
days
kings
kept
their
crowns
on
their
heads
,
and
not
in
the
Tower
---
stamped
the
ground
,
rapped
his
forehead
,
wondered
why
his
own
flesh
and
blood
rebelled
against
him
,
and
,
finally
,
calling
in
his
guards
,
ordered
the
prince
away
to
instant
Confinement
in
a
lofty
turret
;
a
course
of
treatment
which
the
kings
of
old
very
generally
pursued
towards
their
sons
,
when
their
matrimonial
inclinations
did
not
happen
to
point
to
the
same
quarter
as
their
own
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
Prince
Bladud
had
been
shut
up
in
the
lofty
turret
for
the
greater
part
of
a
year
,
with
no
better
prospect
before
his
bodily
eyes
than
a
stone
wall
,
or
before
his
mental
vision
than
prolonged
imprisonment
,
he
naturally
began
to
ruminate
on
a
plan
of
escape
,
which
,
after
months
of
preparation
,
he
managed
to
accomplish
;
considerately
leaving
his
dinner
-
knife
in
the
heart
of
his
jailer
,
lest
the
poor
fellow
(
who
had
a
family
)
should
be
considered
privy
to
his
flight
,
and
punished
accordingly
by
the
infuriated
king
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
monarch
was
frantic
at
the
loss
of
his
son
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
not
on
whom
to
vent
his
grief
and
wrath
,
until
fortunately
bethinking
himself
of
the
lord
chamberlain
who
had
brought
him
home
,
he
struck
off
his
pension
and
his
head
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
Meanwhile
,
the
young
prince
,
effectually
disguised
,
wandered
on
foot
through
his
father
's
dominions
,
cheered
and
supported
in
all
his
hardships
by
sweet
thoughts
of
the
Athenian
maid
,
who
was
the
innocent
cause
of
his
weary
trials
.
 
<EOS>
One
day
he
stopped
to
rest
in
a
country
village
;
and
seeing
that
there
were
gay
dances
going
forward
on
the
green
,
and
gay
faces
passing
to
and
fro
,
ventured
to
inquire
of
a
reveller
who
stood
near
him
,
the
reason
for
this
rejoicing
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Know
you
not
,
O
stranger
,
"
was
the
reply
,
"
of
the
recent
proclamation
of
our
gracious
king
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
Proclamation
!
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
What
proclamation
?
<EOS>
"
rejoined
the
prince
---
for
he
had
travelled
along
the
by
and
little
-
frequented
ways
,
and
knew
nothing
of
what
had
passed
upon
the
public
roads
,
such
as
they
were
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Why
,
"
replied
the
peasant
,
"
the
foreign
lady
that
our
prince
wished
to
we
d
,
is
married
to
a
foreign
noble
of
her
own
country
,
and
the
king
proclaims
the
fact
,
and
a
great
public
festival
besides
;
for
now
,
of
course
,
Prince
Bladud
will
come
back
and
marry
the
lady
his
father
chose
,
who
they
say
is
as
beautiful
as
the
noonday
sun
.
 
<EOS>
Your
health
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
God
save
the
king
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
prince
remained
to
hear
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
fled
from
the
spot
,
and
plunged
into
the
thickest
recesses
of
a
neighbouring
wood
.
<EOS>
On
,
on
,
he
wandered
,
night
and
day
;
beneath
the
blazing
sun
,
and
the
cold
pale
moon
;
through
the
dry
heat
of
noon
,
and
the
damp
cold
of
night
;
in
the
gray
light
of
morn
,
and
the
red
glare
of
eve
.
 
<EOS>
So
heedless
was
he
of
time
or
object
,
that
being
bound
for
Athens
,
he
wandered
as
far
out
of
his
way
as
Bath
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
city
where
Bath
stands
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
vestige
of
human
habitation
,
or
sign
of
man
's
resort
,
to
bear
the
name
;
but
there
was
the
same
noble
country
,
the
same
broad
expanse
of
hill
and
dale
,
the
same
beautiful
channel
stealing
on
,
far
away
,
the
same
lofty
mountains
which
,
like
the
troubles
of
life
,
viewed
at
a
distance
,
and
partially
obscured
by
the
bright
mist
of
its
morning
,
lose
their
ruggedness
and
asperity
,
and
seem
all
ease
and
softness
.
 
<EOS>
Moved
by
the
gentle
beauty
of
the
scene
,
the
prince
sank
upon
the
green
turf
,
and
bathed
his
swollen
feet
in
his
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
the
unhappy
Bladud
,
clasping
his
hands
,
and
mournfully
raising
his
eyes
towards
the
sky
,
"
would
that
my
wanderings
might
end
here
!
 
<EOS>
Would
that
these
grateful
tears
with
which
I
now
mourn
hope
misplaced
,
and
love
despised
,
might
flow
in
peace
for
ever
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
wish
was
heard
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
time
of
the
heathen
deities
,
who
used
occasionally
to
take
people
at
their
words
,
with
a
promptness
,
in
some
cases
,
extremely
awkward
.
 
<EOS>
The
ground
opened
beneath
the
prince
's
feet
;
he
sank
into
the
chasm
;
and
instantaneously
it
closed
upon
his
head
for
ever
,
save
where
his
hot
tears
welled
up
through
the
earth
,
and
where
they
have
continued
to
gush
forth
ever
since
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
observable
that
,
to
this
day
,
large
numbers
of
elderly
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
have
been
disappointed
in
procuring
partners
,
and
almost
as
many
young
ones
who
are
anxious
to
obtain
them
,
repair
annually
to
Bath
to
drink
the
waters
,
from
which
they
derive
much
strength
and
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
most
complimentary
to
the
virtue
of
Prince
Bladud
's
tears
,
and
strongly
corroborative
of
the
veracity
of
this
legend

Mr
Pickwick
yawned
several
times
when
he
had
arrived
at
the
end
of
this
little
manuscript
,
carefully
refolded
,
and
replaced
it
in
the
inkstand
drawer
,
and
then
,
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
the
utmost
weariness
,
lighted
his
chamber
candle
,
and
went
upstairs
to
bed
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
at
Mr
Dowler
's
door
,
according
to
custom
,
and
knocked
to
say
good
-
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Dowler
,
"
going
to
bed
?
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
was

<EOS>
Dismal
night

<EOS>
Windy

Very

"
Good

Good

<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
went
to
his
bedchamber
,
and
Mr
Dowler
resumed
his
seat
before
the
fire
,
in
fulfilment
of
his
rash
promise
to
sit
up
till
his
wife
came
home
.
   
<EOS>
There
are
few
things
more
worrying
than
sitting
up
for
somebody
,
especially
if
that
somebody
be
at
a
party
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
help
thinking
how
quickly
the
time
passes
with
them
,
which
drags
so
heavily
with
you
;
and
the
more
you
think
of
this
,
the
more
your
hopes
of
their
speedy
arrival
decline
.
 
<EOS>
Clocks
tick
so
loud
,
too
,
when
you
are
sitting
up
alone
,
and
you
seem
as
if
you
had
an
under
-
garment
of
cobwebs
on
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
something
tickles
your
right
knee
,
and
then
the
same
sensation
irritates
your
left
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
no
sooner
changed
your
position
,
than
it
comes
again
in
the
arms
;
when
you
have
fidgeted
your
limbs
into
all
sorts
of
queer
shapes
,
you
have
a
sudden
relapse
in
the
nose
,
which
you
rub
as
if
to
rub
it
off
---
as
there
is
no
doubt
you
would
,
if
you
could
.
<EOS>
Eyes
,
too
,
are
mere
personal
inconveniences
;
and
the
wick
of
one
candle
gets
an
inch
and
a
half
long
,
while
you
are
snuffing
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
These
,
and
various
other
little
nervous
annoyances
<EOS>
,
render
sitting
up
for
a
length
of
time
after
everybody
else
has
gone
to
bed
,
anything
but
a
cheerful
amusement
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
just
Mr
Dowler
's
opinion
,
as
he
sat
before
the
fire
,
and
felt
honestly
indignant
with
all
the
inhuman
people
at
the
party
who
were
keeping
him
up
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
put
into
better
humour
either
,
by
the
reflection
that
he
had
taken
it
into
his
head
,
<EOS>
early
in
the
evening
,
to
think
he
had
got
an
ache
there
,
and
so
stopped
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
after
several
droppings
asleep
,
and
fallings
forward
towards
the
bars
,
and
catchings
backward
soon
enough
to
prevent
being
branded
in
the
face
,
Mr
Dowler
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
throw
himself
on
the
bed
in
the
back
room
and
think
---
not
sleep
,
of
course
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
heavy
sleeper
,
"
said
Mr
Dowler
,
as
he
flung
himself
on
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
keep
awake
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
shall
hear
a
knock
here
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
hear
the
watchman
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
goes
.
<EOS>
Fainter
now
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
fainter
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
turning
the
corner
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
When
Mr
Dowler
arrived
at
this
point
,
he
turned
the
corner
at
which
he
had
been
long
hesitating
,
and
fell
fast
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
Just
as
the
clock
struck
three
,
there
was
blown
into
the
crescent
a
sedan
-
chair
with
Mrs
Dowler
inside
,
borne
by
one
short
,
fat
chairman
,
and
one
long
,
thin
one
,
who
had
had
much
ado
to
keep
their
bodies
perpendicular
:
to
say
nothing
of
the
chair
.
<EOS>
But
on
that
high
ground
,
and
in
the
crescent
,
which
the
wind
swept
round
and
round
as
if
it
were
going
to
tear
the
paving
stones
up
,
its
fury
was
tremendous
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
very
glad
to
set
the
chair
down
,
and
give
a
good
round
loud
double
-
knock
at
the
street
door
.
   
<EOS>
They
waited
some
time
,
but
nobody
came
.
   
<EOS>
"
Servants
is
in
the
arms
o
'
Porpus
,
I
think
,
"
said
the
short
chairman
,
warming
his
hands
at
the
attendant
link
-
boy
's
torch
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
'd
give
'em
a
squeeze
and
wake
'
em
,
"
observed
the
long
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
Knock
again
,
<EOS>
will
you
,
if
you
please
,
"
cried
Mrs
Dowler
from
the
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Knock
two
or
three
times
,
if
you
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
short
man
was
quite
willing
to
get
the
job
over
,
as
soon
as
possible
;
so
he
stood
on
the
step
,
and
gave
four
or
five
most
startling
double
-
knocks
,
of
eight
or
ten
knocks
a
-
piece
,
while
the
long
man
went
into
the
road
,
and
looked
up
at
the
windows
for
a
light
.
   
<EOS>
Nobody
came
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
all
as
silent
and
dark
as
ever
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
Mrs
Dowler
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
knock
again
,
if
you
please
.
"
<EOS>
"
There
ai
n't
a
bell
,
is
there
,
ma'am
?
"
said
the
short
chairman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
there
is
,
"
interposed
the
link
-
boy
,
"
I
've
been
a
-
ringing
at
it
ever
so
long
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
only
a
handle
,
"
said
Mrs
Dowler
,
"
the
wire
's
broken
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
the
servants
"
heads
wos
,
"
growled
the
long
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
trouble
you
to
knock
again
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
Mrs
Dowler
,
with
the
utmost
politeness
.
   
<EOS>
The
short
man
did
knock
again
several
times
,
without
producing
the
smallest
effect
.
 
<EOS>
The
tall
man
,
growing
very
impatient
,
then
relieved
him
,
and
kept
on
perpetually
knocking
double
-
knocks
of
two
loud
knocks
each
,
like
an
insane
postman
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
Mr
Winkle
began
to
dream
that
he
was
at
a
club
,
and
that
the
members
being
very
refractory
,
the
chairman
was
obliged
to
hammer
the
table
a
good
deal
to
preserve
order
;
then
he
had
a
confused
notion
of
an
auction
room
where
there
were
no
bidders
,
and
the
auctioneer
was
buying
everything
in
;
and
ultimately
he
began
to
think
it
just
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
somebody
might
be
knocking
at
the
street
door
.
 
<EOS>
To
make
quite
certain
,
however
,
he
remained
quiet
in
bed
for
ten
minutes
or
so
,
and
listened
;
and
when
he
had
counted
two
or
three
-
and
-
thirty
knocks
,
he
felt
quite
satisfied
,
and
gave
himself
a
great
deal
of
credit
for
being
so
wakeful
.

<EOS>
"
went
the
knocker
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
jumped
out
of
bed
,
wondering
very
much
what
could
possibly
be
the
matter
,
and
hastily
putting
on
his
stockings
and
slippers
,
folded
his
dressing
-
gown
round
him
,
lighted
a
flat
candle
from
the
rush
-
light
that
was
burning
in
the
fireplace
,
and
hurried
downstairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
somebody
comin
'
<EOS>
at
last
,
ma'am
,
"
said
the
short
chairman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
wos
behind
him
vith
a
bradawl
,
"
muttered
the
long
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
there
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Winkle
,
undoing
the
chain
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
stop
to
ask
questions
,
cast
-
iron
head
,
"
replied
the
long
man
,
with
great
disgust
,
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
inquirer
was
a
footman
;
"
but
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
look
sharp
,
timber
eyelids
,
"
added
the
other
encouragingly
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
,
being
half
asleep
,
obeyed
the
command
mechanically
,
opened
the
door
a
little
,
and
peeped
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
thing
he
saw
,
was
the
red
glare
of
the
link
-
boy
's
torch
.
 
<EOS>
Startled
by
the
sudden
fear
that
the
house
might
be
on
fire
,
he
hastily
threw
the
door
wide
open
,
and
holding
the
candle
above
his
head
,
stared
eagerly
before
him
,
not
quite
certain
whether
what
he
saw
was
a
sedan
-
chair
or
a
fire
-
engine
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
instant
there
came
a
violent
gust
of
wind
;
the
light
was
blown
out
;
Mr
Winkle
felt
himself
irresistibly
impelled
on
to
the
steps
;
and
the
door
blew
to
,
with
a
loud
crash
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
young
man
,
now
you
HAVE
done
it
!
"
said
the
short
chairman
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
,
catching
sight
of
a
lady
's
face
at
the
window
of
the
sedan
,
turned
hastily
round
,
plied
the
knocker
with
all
his
might
and
main
,
and
called
frantically
upon
the
chairman
to
take
the
chair
away
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
it
away
,
take
it
away
,
"
cried
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
somebody
coming
out
of
another
house
;
put
me
into
the
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Hide
me
!
 
<EOS>
Do
something
with
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
All
this
time
he
was
shivering
with
cold
;
and
every
time
he
raised
his
hand
to
the
knocker
<EOS>
,
the
wind
took
the
dressing
-
gown
in
a
most
unpleasant
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
people
are
coming
down
the
crescent
now
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
ladies
with
'em
;
cover
me
up
with
something
.
 
<EOS>
Stand
before
me
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
chairmen
were
too
much
exhausted
with
laughing
to
afford
him
the
slightest
assistance
,
and
the
ladies
were
every
moment
approaching
nearer
and
nearer
.
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
gave
a
last
hopeless
knock
;
the
ladies
were
only
a
few
doors
off
.
 
<EOS>
He
threw
away
the
extinguished
candle
,
which
,
all
this
time
he
had
held
above
his
head
,
and
fairly
bolted
into
the
sedan
-
chair
where
Mrs
Dowler
was
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
Mrs
Craddock
had
heard
the
knocking
and
the
voices
at
last
;
and
,
only
waiting
to
put
something
smarter
on
her
head
than
her
nightcap
,
ran
down
into
the
front
drawing
-
room
to
make
sure
that
it
was
the
right
party
.
 
<EOS>
Throwing
up
the
window
-
sash
as
Mr
Winkle
was
rushing
into
the
chair
,
she
no
sooner
caught
sight
of
what
was
going
forward
below
,
than
she
raised
a
vehement
and
dismal
shriek
,
and
implored
Mr
Dowler
to
get
up
directly
,
for
his
wife
was
running
away
with
another
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Mr
Dowler
bounced
off
the
bed
as
abruptly
as
an
India
-
rubber
ball
,
and
rushing
into
the
front
room
,
arrived
at
one
window
just
as
Mr
Pickwick
threw
up
the
other
,
when
the
first
object
that
met
the
gaze
of
both
,
was
Mr
Winkle
bolting
into
the
sedan
-
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
Watchman
,
"
shouted
Dowler
furiously
,
"
stop
him
---
hold
him
 
---
keep
him
tight
---
shut
him
in
,
till
I
come
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
cut
his
throat
---
give
me
a
knife
---
from
ear
<EOS>
to
ear
,
Mrs
Craddock
---
I
will
!
"
<EOS>
And
breaking
from
the
shrieking
landlady
,
and
from
Mr
Pickwick
,
the
indignant
husband
seized
a
small
supper
-
knife
,
and
tore
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
But
Mr
Winkle
did
n't
wait
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
heard
the
horrible
threat
of
the
valorous
Dowler
,
than
he
bounced
out
of
the
sedan
,
quite
as
quickly
as
he
had
bounced
in
,
and
throwing
off
his
slippers
into
the
road
,
took
to
his
heels
and
tore
round
the
crescent
,
hotly
pursued
by
Dowler
and
the
watchman
.
 
<EOS>
He
kept
ahead
;
the
door
was
open
as
he
came
round
the
second
time
;
he
rushed
in
,
slammed
it
in
Dowler
's
face
,
mounted
to
his
bedroom
,
locked
the
door
,
piled
a
wash
-
hand
-
stand
,
chest
of
drawers
,
and
a
table
against
it
,
and
packed
up
a
few
necessaries
ready
for
flight
with
the
first
ray
of
morning
.
   
<EOS>
Dowler
came
up
to
the
outside
of
the
door
;
avowed
,
through
the
keyhole
,
his
steadfast
determination
of
cutting
Mr
Winkle
's
throat
next
day
;
and
,
after
a
great
confusion
of
voices
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
amidst
which
that
of
Mr
Pickwick
was
distinctly
heard
endeavouring
to
make
peace
,
the
inmates
dispersed
to
their
several
bed
-
chambers
,
and
all
was
quiet
once
more
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
not
unlikely
that
the
inquiry
may
be
made
,
where
Mr
Weller
was
,
all
this
time
?
 
<EOS>
We
will
state
where
he
was
,
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
37
.
<EOS>
Honourably
accounts
for
Mr
Weller
's
absence
,
by
describing
a
soiree
to
which
he
was
invited
and
went
;
also
relates
how
he
was
entrusted
by
Mr
Pickwick
with
a
private
mission
of
delicacy
and
importance
 
"
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
Mrs
Craddock
,
upon
the
morning
of
this
very
eventful
day
,
"
here
's
a
letter
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
odd
that
,
"
said
Sam
;
"
I
'm
afeerd
there
must
be
somethin'
the
matter
,
for
I
do
n't
recollect
any
gen'l'm'n
in
my
circle
of
acquaintance
as
is
capable
o
'
writin
'
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
something
uncommon
has
taken
place
,
"
observed
Mrs
Craddock
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
somethin'
<EOS>
wery
uncommon
indeed
,
as
could
perduce
a
letter
out
o
'
any
friend
o
'
mine
,
"
replied
Sam
,
shaking
his
head
dubiously
;
"
<EOS>
nothin'
less
than
a
nat'ral
conwulsion
,
as
the
young
gen'l'm'n
observed
<EOS>
ven
<EOS>
he
wos
took
with
fits
.
 
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
be
from
the
gov'ner
,
"
said
Sam
,
looking
at
the
direction
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
always
prints
,
I
know
,
"
cos
he
learnt
writin
'
from
the
large
bills
in
the
booking
-
offices
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
wery
strange
thing
now
,
where
this
here
letter
can
ha
'
come
from
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Sam
said
this
,
he
did
what
a
great
many
people
do
when
they
are
uncertain
about
the
writer
of
a
note
---
looked
at
the
seal
,
and
then
at
the
front
,
and
then
at
the
back
,
and
then
at
the
sides
,
and
then
at
the
superscription
;
and
,
as
a
last
resource
,
thought
perhaps
he
might
as
well
look
at
the
inside
,
and
try
to
find
out
from
that
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
wrote
on
gilt
-
edged
paper
,
"
said
Sam
,
as
he
unfolded
it
,
"
and
sealed
in
bronze
vax
vith
the
top
of
a
door
key
.
 
<EOS>
Now
for
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
with
a
very
grave
face
,
Mr
Weller
slowly
read
as
follows
---
   
<EOS>
"
A
select
company
of
the
Bath
footmen
presents
their
compliments
to
Mr
Weller
,
and
requests
the
pleasure
of
his
company
this
evening
,
to
a
friendly
swarry
,
consisting
of
a
boiled
leg
of
mutton
with
the
usual
trimmings
.
 
<EOS>
The
swarry
to
be
on
table
at
half
-
past
nine
o'clock
punctually
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
inclosed
in
another
note
,
which
ran
thus
---
   
"
<EOS>
Mr
John
Smauker
,
the
gentleman
who
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
Mr
Weller
at
the
house
of
their
mutual
acquaintance
,
Mr
Bantam
,
a
few
days
since
,
begs
to
inclose
Mr
Weller
the
herewith
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mr
Weller
will
call
on
Mr
John
Smauker
at
nine
o'clock
,
Mr
John
Smauker
will
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
Mr
Weller
.
     
<EOS>
(
Signed
)
       
"
JOHN
SMAUKER
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
envelope
was
directed
to
blank
Weller
,
Esq
.
,
at
Mr
Pickwick
's
;
and
in
a
parenthesis
,
in
the
left
hand
corner
,
were
the
words
"
airy
bell
,
"
as
an
instruction
to
the
bearer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
this
is
comin
'
<EOS>
it
rayther
powerful
,
this
is

<EOS>
I
never
heerd
a
biled
leg
o

mutton
called
a
swarry
afore

<EOS>
I
wonder
wot
they
'd
call
a
roast
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
However
,
without
waiting
to
debate
the
point
,
Sam
at
once
betook
himself
into
the
presence
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
requested
leave
of
absence
for
that
evening
,
which
was
readily
granted
.
<EOS>
With
this
permission
and
the
street
-
door
key
,
Sam
Weller
issued
forth
a
little
before
the
appointed
time
,
and
strolled
leisurely
towards
Queen
Square
,
which
he
no
sooner
gained
than
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
beholding
Mr
John
Smauker
leaning
his
powdered
head
against
a
lamp
-
post
at
a
short
distance
off
,
smoking
a
cigar
through
an
amber
tube
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Mr
Weller
?
"
said
Mr
John
Smauker
,
raising
his
hat
gracefully
with
one
hand
,
while
he
gently
waved
the
other
in
a
condescending
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
reasonably
conwalessent
,
"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
YOU
find
yourself
,
my
dear
feller
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
so
so
,
"
said
Mr
John
Smauker
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
've
been
a
-
workin
'
too
hard
,
"
observed
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
fearful
you
would
;
it
wo
n't
do
,
you
know
;
you
must
not
give
way
to
that
'
ere
uncompromisin
'
spirit
o

yourn
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
so
much
that
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
replied
Mr
John
Smauker
,
"
as
bad
wine
;
I
'm
afraid
I
've
been
dissipating
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
's
it
,
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
said
Sam
;
<EOS>
"
that
's
a
wery
bad
complaint
,
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
the
temptation
,
you
see
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
observed
Mr
John
Smauker
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Plunged
into
the
very
vortex
of
society
,
you
know
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
Mr
John
Smauker
,
with
a
sigh
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dreadful
,
indeed
!
"
rejoined
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
always
the
way
,
"
said
Mr
John
Smauker
;
"
if
your
destiny
leads
you
into
public
life
,
and
public
station
,
you
must
expect
to
be
subjected
to
temptations
which
other
people
is
free
from
,
Mr
Weller
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Precisely
what
my
uncle
said
,
ven
he
vent
into
the
public

remarked
Sam
,
"
and
wery
right
the
old
gen'l'm'n

,
for
he
drank
hisself
to
death
in
somethin'
less

"
<EOS>
Mr
John
Smauker
looked
deeply
indignant
at
any
parallel
being
drawn
between
himself
and
the
deceased
gentleman
in
question
;
but
,
as
Sam
's
face
was
in
the
most
immovable
state
of
calmness
,
he
thought
better
of
it
,
and
looked
affable
again
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
we
had
better
be
walking
,
"
said
Mr
Smauker
,
consulting
a
copper
timepiece
which
dwelt
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
watch
-
pocket
,
and
was
raised
to
the
surface
by
means
of
a
black
string
,
with
a
copper
key
at
the
other
end
.
   
<EOS>
"
P'raps
we
had
,
"
replied
Sam
,
"
or
they
'll
overdo
the
swarry
,
and
that
'll
spile
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
drank
the
waters
,
Mr
Weller
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
his
companion
,
as
they
walked
towards
High
Street
.
   
<EOS>
"
Once
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
think
of
'em
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
they
was
particklery
unpleasant
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Mr
John
Smauker
,
"
you
disliked
the
killibeate
taste
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
much
about
that
'
ere
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
they
'd
a
wery
strong
flavour
o
'
warm
flat
irons
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
IS
the
killibeate
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
observed
Mr
John
Smauker
contemptuously
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
if
it
is
,
it
's
a
wery
inexpressive
word
<EOS>
,
that
's
all
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
,
but
I
ai
n't
much
in
the
chimical
line
myself
,
so
I
ca
n't
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
here
,
to
the
great
horror
of
Mr
John
Smauker
,
Sam
Weller
began
to
whistle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
Mr
John
Smauker
,
agonised
at
the
exceeding
ungenteel
sound
,
"
will
you
take
my
arm
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
you
're
wery
good
,
but
I
wo
n't
deprive
you
of
it
,
"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
rayther
a
way
o
'
putting
my
hands
in
my
pockets
,
if
it
's
all
the
same
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
Sam
said
this
,
he
suited
the
action
to
the
word
,
and
whistled
far
louder
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
way
,
"
said
his
new
friend
,
apparently
much
relieved
as
they
turned
down
a
by
-
street
;
"
we
shall
soon
be
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
?
"
said
Sam
,
quite
unmoved
by
the
announcement
of
his
close
vicinity
to
the
select
footmen
of
Bath
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr
John
Smauker
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
alarmed
,
Mr
Weller
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
see
some
very
handsome
uniforms
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
continued
Mr
John
Smauker
;
"
and
perhaps
you
'll
find
some
of
the
gentlemen
rather
high
at
first
,
you
know
,
but
they
'll
soon
come
round
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
wery
kind
on
'
em
,
"
replied
Sam
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
know
,
"
resumed
Mr
John
Smauker
,
with
an
air
of
sublime
protection
---
"
you
know
,
as
you
're
a
stranger
,
perhaps
,
they
'll
be
rather
hard
upon
you
at
first
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
wo
n't
be
wery
cruel
,
though
,
will
they
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
"
replied
Mr
John
Smauker
,
pulling
forth
the
fox
's
head
,
and
taking
a
gentlemanly
pinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
are
some
funny
dogs
among
us
,
and
they
will
have
their
joke
,
you
know
;
but
you
must
n't
mind
'em
<EOS>
,
you
must
n't
mind
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
try
and
bear
up
agin
<EOS>
such
a
reg'lar
knock
down
o
'
talent
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
"
said
Mr
John
Smauker
,
putting
forth
his
fox
's
head
,
and
elevating
his
own
;
"
I
'll
stand
by
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
By
this
time
they
had
reached
a
small
greengrocer
's
shop
,
which
Mr
John
Smauker
entered
,
followed
by
Sam
,
who
,
the
moment
he
got
behind
him
,
relapsed
into
a
series
of
the
very
broadest
and
most
unmitigated
grins
,
and
manifested
other
demonstrations
of
being
in
a
highly
enviable
state
of
inward
merriment
.
   
<EOS>
Crossing
the
greengrocer
's
shop
,
and
putting
their
hats
on
the
stairs
in
the
little
passage
behind
it
,
they
walked
into
a
small
parlour
;
and
here
the
full
splendour
of
the
scene
burst
upon
Mr
Weller
's
view
.
   
<EOS>
A
couple
of
tables
were
put
together
in
the
middle
of
the
parlour
,
covered
with
three
or
four
cloths
of
different
ages
and
dates
of
washing
,
arranged
to
look
as
much
like
one
as
the
circumstances
of
the
case
would
allow
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
these
were
laid
knives
and
forks
for
six
or
eight
people
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
knife
handles
were
green
,
others
red
,
and
a
few
yellow
;
and
as
all
the
forks
were
black
,
the
combination
of
colours
was
exceedingly
striking
.
 
<EOS>
Plates
for
a
corresponding
number
of
guests
were
warming
behind
the
fender
;
and
the
guests
themselves
were
warming
before
it
:
<EOS>
the
chief
and
most
important
of
whom
appeared
to
be
a
stoutish
gentleman
in
a
bright
crimson
coat
with
long
tails
,
vividly
red
breeches
,
and
a
cocked
hat
,
who
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
and
had
apparently
just
entered
,
for
besides
retaining
his
cocked
hat
on
his
head
,
he
carried
in
his
hand
a
high
stick
,
such
as
gentlemen
of
his
profession
usually
elevate
in
a
sloping
position
over
the
roofs
of
carriages
.
   
<EOS>
"
Smauker
,
my
lad
,
your
fin
,
"
said
the
gentleman
with
the
cocked
hat
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Smauker
dovetailed
the
top
joint
of
his
right
-
hand
little
finger
into
that
of
the
gentleman
with
the
cocked
hat
,
and
said
he
was
charmed
to
see
him
looking
so
well
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
they
tell
me
I
am
looking
pretty
blooming
,
"
said
the
man
with
the
cocked
hat
,
"
and
it
's
a
wonder
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
following
our
old
woman
about
,
two
hours
a
day
,
for
the
last
fortnight
;
and
if
a
constant
contemplation
of
the
manner
in
which
she
hooks
-
and
-
eyes
that
infernal
lavender
-
coloured
old
gown
of
hers
behind
,
is
n't
enough
to
throw
anybody
into
a
low
state
of
despondency
for
life
,
stop
my
quarter
's
salary
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
,
the
assembled
selections
laughed
very
heartily
;
and
one
gentleman
in
a
yellow
waistcoat
,
with
a
coach
-
trimming
border
,
whispered
a
neighbour
in
green
-
foil
smalls
,
that
Tuckle
was
in
spirits
to
-
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
the
bye
,
"
said
Mr
Tuckle
,
"
Smauker
,
my
boy
,
you
---
"
<EOS>
The
remainder
of
the
sentence
was
forwarded
into
Mr
John
Smauker
's
ear
,
by
whisper
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
me
,
I
quite
forgot
,
"
said
Mr
John
Smauker
.
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
my
friend
Mr
Weller
.
"
   
"
Sorry
to
keep
the
fire
off
you
,
Weller
,
"
said
Mr
Tuckle
,
with
a
familiar
nod
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hope
<EOS>
you
're
not
cold
,
Weller
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Not
by
no
means
,
Blazes
,
"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
'
ud
be
a
wery
chilly
subject
as
felt
cold
wen
you
stood
opposite
.
 
<EOS>
You
'd
save
coals
if
they
put
you
behind
the
fender
in
the
waitin'-room
at
a
public
office
,
you
would
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
this
retort
appeared
to
convey
rather
a
personal
allusion
to
Mr
Tuckle
's
crimson
livery
,
that
gentleman
looked
majestic
for
a
few
seconds
,
but
gradually
edging
away
from
the
fire
,
broke
into
a
forced
smile
,
and
said
it
was
n't
bad
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
much
obliged
for
your
good
opinion
,
sir
,
"
replied
Sam
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
get
on
by
degrees
,
I
des
-
say
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
try
a
better
one
by
and
bye
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
point
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
a
gentleman
in
orange
-
coloured
plush
,
accompanied
by
another
selection
in
purple
cloth
,
with
a
great
extent
of
stocking
.
<EOS>
The
new
-
comers
having
been
welcomed
by
the
old
ones
,
Mr
Tuckle
put
the
question
that
supper
be
ordered
in
,
which
was
carried
unanimously
.
   
<EOS>
The
greengrocer
and
his
wife
then
arranged
upon
the
table
a
boiled
leg
of
mutton
,
hot
,
with
caper
sauce
,
turnips
,
and
potatoes
.
<EOS>
Mr
Tuckle
took
the
chair
,
and
was
supported
at
the
other
end
of
the
board
by
the
gentleman
in
orange
plush
.
 
<EOS>
The
greengrocer
put
on
a
pair
of
wash
-
leather
gloves
to
hand
the
plates
with
,
and
stationed
himself
behind
Mr
Tuckle
's
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
Harris
,
"
said
Mr
Tuckle
,
in
a
commanding
tone
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
the
greengrocer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
got
your
gloves
on
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Sir
.
"
   
"
Then
take
the
kiver
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
greengrocer
did
as
he
was
told
,
with
a
show
of
great
humility
,
and
obsequiously
handed
Mr
Tuckle
the
carving
-
knife
;
in
doing
which
,
he
accidentally
gaped
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
that
,
Sir
?
"
said
Mr
Tuckle
,
with
great
asperity
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
crestfallen
greengrocer
,
"
I
did
n't
mean
to
do
it
,
Sir
;
I
was
up
very
late
last
night
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
my
opinion
of
you
is
,
Harris
,
"
said
Mr
Tuckle
,
with
a
most
impressive
air
,
"
you
're
a
wulgar
beast
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Harris
,
"
that
you
wo
n't
be
severe
with
me
,
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
indeed
,
gentlemen
,
for
your
patronage
,
and
also
for
your
recommendations
,
gentlemen
,
whenever
additional
assistance
in
waiting
is
required
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
gentlemen
,
I
give
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
you
do
n't
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tuckle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
far
from
it
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
consider
you
an
inattentive
reskel
,
"
said
the
gentleman
in
the
orange
plush
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
a
low
thief
,
"
added
the
gentleman
in
the
green
-
foil
smalls
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
an
unreclaimable
blaygaird
,
"
added
the
gentleman
in
purple
.
   
<EOS>
The
poor
greengrocer
bowed
very
humbly
while
these
little
epithets
were
bestowed
upon
him
,
in
the
true
spirit
of
the
very
smallest
tyranny
;
and
when
everybody
had
said
something
to
show
his
superiority
,
Mr
Tuckle
proceeded
to
carve
the
leg
of
mutton
,
and
to
help
the
company
.
   
<EOS>
This
important
business
of
the
evening
had
hardly
commenced
,
when
the
door
was
thrown
briskly
open
,
and
another
gentleman
in
a
light
-
blue
suit
,
and
leaden
buttons
,
made
his
appearance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Against
the
rules
,
"
said
Mr
Tuckle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Too
late
,
too
late
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
positively
I
could
n't
help
it
,
"
said
the
gentleman
in
blue
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
appeal
to
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
An
affair
of
gallantry
now
,
an
appointment
at
the
theayter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
indeed

"
said
the
gentleman
in
the
orange
plush
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
raly
now
,
honour
bright
,
"
said
the
man
in
blue
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
made
a
promese
to
fetch
our
youngest
daughter
at
half
-
past
ten
,
and
she
is
such
an
uncauminly
fine
gal
,
that
I
raly
had

disappint
her

<EOS>
No

a

a
petticut
<EOS>

Sir

is
irrevokeable

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
suspect
there
's
something
in
that
quarter
,
"
said
Tuckle
,
as
the
new
-
comer
took
his
seat
next
Sam
,
"
I
've
remarked
,
once
or
twice
,
that
she
leans
very
heavy
on
your
shoulder
when
she
gets
in
and
out
of
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

raly
,
raly
,
Tuckle
,
you
should
n't

"
said
the
man
in
blue
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
fair
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
said
to
one
or
two
friends
that
she
wos
a
very
divine
creechure

had
refused
one

two
offers

<EOS>
no

no

no

indeed

Tuckle

not

<EOS>
Delicacy

my

delicacy

"
 
<EOS>
And
the
man
in
blue
,
pulling
up
his
neckerchief
,
and
adjusting
his
coat
cuffs
,
nodded
and
frowned
as
if
there
were
more
behind
,
which
he
could
say
if
he
liked
,
but
was
bound
in
honour
to
suppress
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
in
blue
being
a
light

haired

stiff

necked

free
and
easy
sort
of
footman

with

had
attracted
Mr
Weller
's
special
attention
at
first
,
but
when
he
began
to
come
out
in
this
way
,
Sam
felt
more
than
ever
disposed
to
cultivate
his
acquaintance
;
so
he
launched
himself
into
the
conversation
at
once
,
with
characteristic
independence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
health
,
Sir
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
like
your
conversation
much
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
's
wery
pretty
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
the
man
in
blue
smiled
,
as
if
it
were
a
compliment
he
was
well
used
to
;
but
looked
approvingly
on
Sam
at
the
same
time
,
and
said
he
hoped
he
should
be
better
acquainted
with
him
,
<EOS>
for
without
any
flattery
at
all
he
seemed
to
have
the
makings
of
a
very
nice
fellow
about
him
,
and
to
be
just
the
man
after
his
own
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
wery
good
,
sir
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
lucky
feller
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
gentleman
in
blue
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
'
ere
young
lady
,
"
replied
Sam
.
"
<EOS>
She
knows
wot
's
wot
,
she
does
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
see
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
closed
one
eye
,
and
shook
his
head
from
side
to
side
,
in
a
manner
which
was
highly
gratifying
to
the
personal
vanity
of
the
gentleman
in
blue
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
your
a
cunning
fellow
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
that
individual
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
leave
all
that
'
ere
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
great
deal
more
in
your
way

mine

"
   
<EOS>
"
Well

Mr

"
said
the
gentleman
in

,
"
I
think

remarked
my

Mr

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should

"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
little
thing
of
that
kind
in
hand
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
favoured
gentleman
in
blue
,
drawing
a
toothpick
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
exactly
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
There

no

I
should

<EOS>
As
it
is
,
I
do
n't
think
I
can
do
with
anythin

under
a
female
markis

<EOS>
I
might
keep
up

a
young

large

if

made

.
 
<EOS>
Not
else
.
"
   
"
Of
course
not
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
the
gentleman
in
blue
,
"
one
ca
n't
be
troubled
,
you
know
;
and
WE
know
,
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
---
we
,
who
are
men
of
the
world
---
<EOS>
that
a
good
uniform
must
work
its
way
with
the
women
,
sooner
or
later
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
that
's
the
only
thing
,
between
you
and
me
,
that
makes
the
service
worth
entering
into
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
so
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
,
o
'
course
.
"
   
<EOS>
When
this
confidential
dialogue
had
gone
thus
far
,
glasses
were
placed
round
,
and
every
gentleman
ordered
what
he
liked
best
,
before
the
public
-
house
shut
up
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
in
blue
,
and
the
man
in
orange
,
who
were
the
chief
exquisites
of
the
party
,
ordered
"
cold
shrub
and
water
,
"
but
with
the
others
,
gin
-
and
-
water
,
sweet
,
appeared
to
be
the
favourite
beverage
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
called
the
greengrocer
a
"
desp'rate
willin
,
"
and
ordered
a
large
bowl
of
punch
---
two
circumstances
which
seemed
to
raise
him
very
much
in
the
opinion
of
the
selections
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
said
the
man
in
blue
,
with
an
air
of
the
most
consummate
dandyism
,
"
I
'll
give
you
the
ladies
;
come
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hear
,
hear
!
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
young
mississes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Here
there
was
a
loud
cry
of
"
Order
,
"
and
<EOS>
Mr
John
Smauker
,
as
the
gentleman
who
had
introduced
Mr
Weller
into
that
company
,
begged
to
inform
him
that
the
word
he
had
just
made
use
of
,
was
unparliamentary
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Which
word
was
that
'
ere
,
Sir
?
"
inquired
Sam
.
<EOS>
"
Mississes
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
John
Smauker
,
with
an
alarming
frown
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't
recognise
such
distinctions
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
wery
good
,
"
said
Sam
;
"
then
I
'll
amend
the
obserwation
and
call
'em
the
dear
creeturs
,
if
Blazes
vill
allow
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Some
doubt
appeared
to
exist
in
the
mind
of
the
gentleman
in
the
green
-
foil
smalls
,
whether
the
chairman
could
be
legally
appealed
to
,
as
"
Blazes
,
"
but
as
the
company
seemed
more
disposed
to
stand
upon
their
own
rights
than
his
,
the
question
was
not
raised
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
with
the
cocked
hat
breathed
short
,
and
looked
long
at
Sam
,
but
apparently
thought
it
as
well
to
say
nothing
,
in
case
he
should
get
the
worst
of
it
.
<EOS>
After
a
short
silence
,
a
gentleman
in
an
embroidered
coat
reaching
down
to
his
heels
,
and
a
waistcoat
of
the
same
which
kept
one
half
of
his
legs
warm
,
stirred
his
gin
-
and
-
water
with
great
energy
,
and
putting
himself
upon
his
feet
,
all
at
once
by
a
violent
effort
,
said
he
was
desirous
of
offering
a
few
remarks
to
the
company
,
<EOS>
whereupon
the
person
in
the
cocked
hat
had
no
doubt
that
the
company
would
be
very
happy
to
hear
any
remarks
that
the
man
in
the
long
coat
might
wish
to
offer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
feel
a
great
delicacy
,
gentlemen
,
in
coming
for'ard
,
"
said
the
man
in
the
long
coat
,
"
having
the
misforchune
to
be
a
coachman
,
and
being
only
admitted
as
a
honorary
member
of
these
agreeable
swarrys
,
but
I
do
feel
myself
bound
,
gentlemen
<EOS>
---
drove
into
a
corner
,
if
I
may
use
the
expression
---
to
make
known
an
afflicting
circumstance
which
has
come
to
my
knowledge
;
which
has
happened
I
may
say
within
the
soap
of
my
everyday
contemplation
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
our
friend
Mr
Whiffers
(
everybody
looked
at
the
individual
in
orange
)
,
our
friend
Mr
Whiffers
has
resigned
.
"
   
<EOS>
Universal
astonishment
fell
upon
the
hearers
.
 
<EOS>
Each
gentleman
looked
in
his
neighbour
's
face
,
and
then
transferred
his
glance
to
the
upstanding
coachman
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
well
be
sapparised
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
the
coachman
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
wenchure
to
state
the
reasons
of
this
irrepairabel
loss
to
the
service
,
but
I
will
beg
Mr
Whiffers
to
state
them
himself
,
for
the
improvement
and
imitation
of
his
admiring
friends
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
suggestion
being
loudly
approved
of
,
Mr
Whiffers
explained
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
certainly
could
have
wished
to
have
continued
to
hold
the
appointment
he
had
just
resigned
.
 
<EOS>
The
uniform
was
extremely
rich
and
expensive
,
the
females
of
the
family
was
most
agreeable
,
and
the
duties
of
the
situation
was
not
,
he
was
bound
to
say
,
too
heavy
;
the
principal
service
that
was
required
of
him
,
being
,
that
he
should
look
out
of
the
hall
window
as
much
as
possible
,
in
company
with
another
gentleman
,
who
had
also
resigned
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
have
wished
to
have
spared
that
company
the
painful
and
disgusting
detail
on
which
he
was
about
to
enter
,
but
as
the
explanation
had
been
demanded
of
him
,
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
state
,
boldly
and
distinctly
,
that
he
had
been
required
to
eat
cold
meat
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
conceive
the
disgust
which
this
avowal
awakened
in
the
bosoms
of
the
hearers
.
 
<EOS>
Loud
cries
of
"
Shame
,
"
mingled
with
groans
and
hisses
,
prevailed
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Whiffers
then
added
that
he
feared
a
portion
of
this
outrage
might
be
traced
to
his
own
forbearing
and
accommodating
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
distinct
recollection
of
having
once
consented
to
eat
salt
butter
,
and
he
had
,
moreover
,
on
an
occasion
of
sudden
sickness
in
the
house
,
so
far
forgotten
himself
as
to
carry
a
coal
-
scuttle
up
to
the
second
floor
.
 
<EOS>
He
trusted
he
had
not
lowered
himself
in
the
good
opinion
of
his
friends
by
this
frank
confession
of
his
faults
;
and
he
hoped
the
promptness
with
which
he
had
resented
the
last
unmanly
outrage
on
his
feelings
,
to
which
he
had
referred
,
would
reinstate
him
in
their
good
opinion
,
if
he
had
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Whiffers
's
address
was
responded
to
,
with
a
shout
of
admiration
,
and
the
health
of
the
interesting
martyr
was
drunk
in
a
most
enthusiastic
manner
;
for
this
,
the
martyr
returned
thanks
,
and
proposed
their
visitor
,
Mr
Weller
---
a
gentleman
whom
he
had
not
the
pleasure
of
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
,
but
who
was
the
friend
of
Mr
John
Smauker
,
which
was
a
sufficient
letter
of
recommendation
to
any
society
of
gentlemen
<EOS>
whatever
,
or
wherever
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
account
,
he
should
have
been
disposed
to
have
given
Mr
Weller
's
health
with
all
the
honours
,
if
his
friends
had
been
drinking
wine
;
but
as
they
were
taking
spirits
by
way
of
a
change
,
and
as
it
might
be
inconvenient
to
empty
a
tumbler
at
every
toast
,
he
should
propose
that
the
honours
be
understood
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
conclusion
of
this
speech
,
everybody
took
a
sip
in
honour
of
Sam
;
and
Sam
having
ladled
out
,
and
drunk
,
two
full
glasses
of
punch
in
honour
of
himself
,
returned
thanks
in
a
neat
speech
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
much
obliged
to
you
,
old
fellers
,
"
said
Sam
,
ladling
away
at
the
punch
in
the
most
unembarrassed
manner
possible
,
"
for
this
here
compliment
;
which
,
comin
'
from
sich
a
quarter
,
is
wery
overvelmin
'
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
heered
a
good
deal
on
you
as
a
body
,
but
I
will
say
,
that
I
never
thought
you
was
sich
uncommon
nice
men
as
I
find
you
air
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
hope
you
'll
take
care
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
yourselves
,
and
not
compromise
nothin'
o
'
<EOS>
your
dignity
,
which
is
a
wery
charmin
'
thing
to
see
,
when
one
's
out
a
-
walkin
'
,
and
has
always
made
me
wery
happy
to
look
at
,
ever
since
I
was
a
boy
about
half
as
high
as
the
brass
-
headed
stick
o
'
my
wery
respectable
friend
,
Blazes
,
there
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
wictim
of
oppression
in
the
suit
<EOS>
o
'
brimstone
,
all
I
can
say
of
him
,
is
,
that
I
hope
he
'll
get
jist
as
good
a
berth
as
he
deserves
;
in
vitch
case
it
's
wery
little
cold
swarry
as
ever
he
'll
be
troubled
with
agin
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Sam
sat
down
with
a
pleasant
smile
,
and
his
speech
having
been
vociferously
applauded
,
the
company
broke
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wy
,
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
're
a
-
goin
'
old
feller
?
"
said
Sam
Weller
to
his
friend
,
Mr
John
Smauker
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
,
indeed
,
"
said
Mr
Smauker
;
"
I
promised
Bantam
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
wery
<EOS>
well
,
"
said
Sam
;
<EOS>
"
that
's
another
thing
.
 
<EOS>
P'raps
he
'd
resign
if
you
disappinted
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
ai
n't
a
-
goin
'
,
Blazes
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
,
"
said
the
man
with
the
cocked
hat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
,
and
leave
three
-
quarters
of
a
bowl
of
punch
behind
you
!
"
said
Sam
;
"
nonsense
,
set
down
agin
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tuckle
was
not
proof
against
this
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
He
laid
aside
the
cocked
hat
and
stick
which
he
had
just
taken
up
,
and
said
he
would
have
one
glass
,
for
good
fellowship
's
sake
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
gentleman
in
blue
went
home
the
same
way
as
Mr
Tuckle
,
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
stop
too
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
punch
was
about
half
gone
,
Sam
ordered
in
some
oysters
from
the
green
-
grocer
's
shop
;
and
the
effect
of
both
was
so
extremely
exhilarating
,
that
Mr
Tuckle
,
dressed
out
with
the
cocked
hat
and
stick
,
danced
the
frog
hornpipe
among
the
shells
on
the
table
,
while
the
gentleman
in
blue
played
an
accompaniment
upon
an
ingenious
musical
instrument
formed
of
a
hair
-
comb
upon
a
curl
-
paper
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
when
the
punch
was
all
gone
,
and
the
night
nearly
so
,
they
sallied
forth
to
see
each
other
home
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tuckle
no
sooner
got
into
the
open
air
,
than
he
was
seized
with
a
sudden
desire
to
lie
on
the
curbstone
;
Sam
thought
it
would
be
a
pity
to
contradict
him
,
and
so
let
him
have
his
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
cocked
hat
would
have
been
spoiled
if
left
there
,
Sam
very
considerately
flattened
it
down
on
the
head
of
the
gentleman
in
blue
,
and
putting
the
big
stick
in
his
hand
,
propped
him
up
against
his
own
street
-
door
,
rang
the
bell
,
and
walked
quietly
home
.
   
<EOS>
At
a
much
earlier
hour
next
morning
than
his
usual
time
of
rising
,
Mr
Pickwick
walked
downstairs
completely
dressed
,
and
rang
the
bell
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
when
Mr
Weller
appeared
in
reply
to
the

<EOS>
Mr
Weller
did
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
was
an
unfortunate
occurrence
here
,
last
night
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
which
gave
Mr
Winkle
some
cause
to
apprehend
violence
from
Mr
Dowler
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
I
've
heerd
from
the
old
lady
downstairs
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
'm
sorry
to
say
,
Sam
,
"
continued
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
a
most
perplexed
countenance
,
"
that
in
dread
of
this
violence
,
Mr
Winkle
has
gone
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Gone
avay
!
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Left
the
house
early
this
morning
,
without
the
slightest
previous
communication
with
me
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
is
gone
,
I
know
not
where
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
should
ha
'
stopped
and
fought
it
out
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Sam
contemptuously
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
n't
take
much
to
settle
that
'
ere
Dowler
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
I
may
have
my
doubts
of
his
great
bravery
and
determination
also
.
 
<EOS>
But
however
that
may
be
,
Mr
Winkle
is
gone
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
be
found
,
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
Found
and
brought
back
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
s'pose
he
wo
n't
come
back
,
Sir
?
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
made
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
to
do
it
,
Sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
,
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
good
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
Mr
Weller
left
the
room
,
and
immediately
afterwards
was
heard
to
shut
the
street
door
.
 
<EOS>
In
two
hours
"
time
he
returned
with
so
much
coolness
as
if
he
had
been
despatched
on
the
most
ordinary
message
possible
,
and
brought
the
information
that
an
individual
,
in
every
respect
answering
Mr
Winkle
's
description
,
had
gone
over
to
Bristol
that
morning
,
by
the
branch
coach
from
the
Royal
Hotel
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
grasping
his
hand
,
"
you

a
capital

an
invaluable

You

Cert'nly

The

Mr

If

I

"
rejoined
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
tell
him
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
that
I
am
highly
excited

highly

indignant

at

proper

<EOS>
"
I
will

"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
tell
him

said
Mr

,
"
that
if
he
does

house

he

I

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
I
'll
mention
that
'
ere

Sir

"
rejoined
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
think
you
can
find
him

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
earnestly
in
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

I
'll
find
him

rejoined
Sam

with
great
confidence

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
the
sooner
you
go
the
better

"
   
<EOS>
With
these
instructions
,
Mr
Pickwick
placed
a
sum
of
money
in
the
hands
of
his
faithful
servitor
,
and
ordered
him
to
start
for
Bristol
immediately
,
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitive
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
put
a
few
necessaries
in
a
carpet
-
bag
,
and
was
ready
for
starting
.
 
<EOS>
He
stopped
when
he
had
got
to
the
end
of
the
passage
,
and
walking
quietly
back
,
thrust
his
head
in
at
the
parlour
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
whispered
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
fully
understands
my
instructions
,
do
I
,
Sir
?
"
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
reg'larly
understood
about
the
knockin

down

is
it

"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perfectly

"
replied
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thoroughly
.
 
<EOS>
Do
what
you
think
necessary
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
my
orders
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sam
gave
a
nod
of
intelligence
,
and
withdrawing
his
head
from
the
door
,
set
forth
on
his
pilgrimage
with
a
light
heart

Chapter
38
.
<EOS>
How
Mr
Winkle
,
when
he
stepped
out
of
the
Frying
-
pan
,
walked
gently
and
comfortably
into
the
fire
 
<EOS>
The
ill
-
starred
gentleman
who
had
been
the
unfortunate
cause
of
the
unusual
noise
and
disturbance
which
alarmed
the
inhabitants
of
the
Royal
Crescent
in
manner
and
form
already
described
,
after
passing
a
night
of
great
confusion
and
anxiety
,
left
the
roof
beneath
which
his
friends
still
slumbered
,
bound
he
knew
not
whither
.
<EOS>
The
excellent
and
considerate
feelings
which
prompted
Mr
Winkle
to
take
this
step
can
never
be
too
highly
appreciated
or
too
warmly
extolled
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
,
"
reasoned
Mr
Winkle
with
himself
---
"
if
this
Dowler
attempts
(
as
I
have
no
doubt
he
will
)
to
carry
into
execution
his
threat
of
personal
violence
against
myself
,
it
will
be
incumbent
on
me
to
call
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
wife
;
that
wife
is
attached
to
,
and
dependent
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
Heavens
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
should
kill
him
in
the
blindness
of
my
wrath
,
what
would
be
my
feelings
ever
afterwards
!
"
 
<EOS>
This
painful
consideration
operated
so
powerfully
on
the
feelings
of
the
humane
young
man
,
as
to
cause
his
knees
to
knock
together
,
and
his
countenance
to
exhibit
alarming
manifestations
of
inward
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
Impelled
by
such
reflections
,
he
grasped
his
carpet
-
bag
,
and
creeping
stealthily
downstairs
,
shut
the
detestable
street
door
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
,
and
walked
off
.
 
<EOS>
Bending
his
steps
towards
the
Royal
Hotel
,
he
found
a
coach
on
the
point
of
starting
for
Bristol
,
and
,
thinking
Bristol
as
good
a
place
for
his
purpose
as
any
other
he
could
go
to
<EOS>
,
he
mounted
the
box
,
and
reached
his
place
of
destination
in
such
time
as
the
pair
of
horses
,
who
went
the
whole
stage
and
back
again
,
twice
a
day
or
more
,
could
be
reasonably
supposed
to
arrive
there
.
<EOS>
He
took
up
his
quarters
at
the
Bush
,
and
designing
to
postpone
any
communication
by
letter
with
Mr
Pickwick
until
it
was
probable
that
Mr
Dowler
's
wrath
might
have
in
some
degree
evaporated
,
walked
forth
to
view
the
city
,
which
struck
him
as
being
a
shade
more
dirty
than
any
place
he
had
ever
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Having
inspected
the
docks
and
shipping
,
and
viewed
the
cathedral
,
he
inquired
his
way
to
Clifton
,
and
being
directed
thither
,
took
the
route
which
was
pointed
out
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
the
pavements
of
Bristol
are
not
the
widest
or
cleanest
upon
earth
,
so
its
streets
are
not
altogether
the
straightest
or
least
intricate
;
and
Mr
Winkle
,
being
greatly
puzzled
by
their
manifold
windings
and
twistings
,
looked
about
him
for
a
decent
shop
in
which
he
could
apply
afresh
for
counsel
and
instruction
.
   
<EOS>
His
eye
fell
upon
a
newly
-
painted
tenement
which
had
been
recently
converted
into
something
between
a
shop
and
a
private
house
,
and
which
a
red
lamp
,
projecting
over
the
fanlight
of
the
street
door
,
would
have
sufficiently
announced
as
the
residence
of
a
medical
practitioner
,
even
if
the
word
"
Surgery
"
had
not
been
inscribed
in
golden
characters
on
a
wainscot
ground
,
above
the
window
of
what
,
in
times
bygone
,
had
been
the
front
parlour
.
<EOS>
Thinking
this
an
eligible
place
wherein
to
make
his
inquiries
,
Mr
Winkle
stepped
into
the
little
shop
where
the
gilt
-
labelled
drawers
and
bottles
were
;
and
finding
nobody
there
,
knocked
with
a
half
-
crown
on
the
counter
,
to
attract
the
attention
of
anybody
who
might
happen
to
be
in
the
back
parlour
,
which
he
judged
to
be
the
innermost
and
peculiar
sanctum
of
the
establishment
,
from
the
repetition
of
the
word
surgery
on
the
door
---
painted
in
white
letters
this
time
,
by
way
of
taking
off
the
monotony
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
first
knock
,
a
sound
,
as
of
persons
fencing
with
fire
-
irons
,
which
had
until
now
been
very
audible
,
suddenly
ceased
;
at
the
second
,
a
studious
-
looking
young
gentleman
in
green
spectacles
,
with
a
very
large
book
in
his
hand
,
glided
quietly
into
the
shop
,
and
stepping
behind
the
counter
,
requested
to
know
the
visitor
's
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
trouble
you
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
"
but
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
direct
me
to
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
"
roared
the
studious
young
gentleman
,
throwing
the
large
book
up
into
the
air
,
and
catching
it
with
great
dexterity
at
the
very
moment
when
it
threatened
to
smash
to
atoms
all
the
bottles
on
the
counter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
start
!
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
,
without
doubt
;
for
Mr
Winkle
was
so
very
much
astonished
at
the
extraordinary
behaviour
of
the
medical
gentleman
,
that
he
involuntarily
retreated
towards
the
door
,
and
looked
very
much
disturbed
at
his
strange
reception
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
do
n't
you
know
me
?
"
said
the
medical
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
murmured
,
in
reply
,
that
he
had
not
that
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
,
"
said
the
medical
gentleman
,
"
there
are
hopes
for
me
yet
;
I
may
attend
half
the
old
women
in
Bristol
,
if
I
've
decent
luck
.
 
<EOS>
Get
out
,
you
mouldy
old
villain
,
get
out
!
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
adjuration
,
which
was
addressed
to
the
large
book
,
the
medical
gentleman
kicked
the
volume
with
remarkable
agility
to
the
farther
end
of
the
shop
,
and
,
pulling
off
his
green
spectacles
,
grinned
the
identical
grin
of
Robert
Sawyer
,
Esquire
,
formerly
of
Guy
's
Hospital
in
the
Borough
,
with
a
private
residence
in
Lant
Street
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
were
n't
down
upon
me
?
"
said
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
shaking
Mr
Winkle
's
hand
with
friendly
warmth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
I
was
not
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
,
returning
his
pressure
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
you
did
n't
see
the
name
,
"
said
Bob
Sawyer
,
calling
his
friend
's
attention
to
the
outer
door
,
on
which
,
in
the
same
white
paint
,
were
traced
the
words
"
Sawyer
,
late
Nockemorf
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
never
caught
my
eye
,
"
returned
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lord
,
if
I
had
known
who
you
were
,
I
should
have
rushed
out
,
and
caught
you
in
my
arms
,
"
said
Bob
Sawyer
;
"
but
upon
my
life
,
I
thought
you
were
the
King's
-
taxes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
indeed
,
"
responded
Bob
Sawyer
,
"
and
I
was
just
going
to
say
that
I
was
n't
at
home
,
but
if
you
'd
leave
a
message
I
'd
be
sure
to
give
it
to
myself
;
for
he
do
n't
know
me
;
no
more
does
the
Lighting
and
Paving
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
Church
-
rates
guesses
who
I
am
,
and
I
know
the
Water
-
works
does
,
because
I
drew
a
tooth
of
his
when
I
first
came
down
here
.
 
<EOS>
But
come
in
,
come
in
!
"
 
<EOS>
Chattering
in
this
way
,
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
pushed
Mr
Winkle
into
the
back
room
,
where
,
amusing
himself
by
boring
little
circular
caverns
in
the
chimney
-
piece
with
a
red
-
hot
poker
,
sat
no
less
a
person
than
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
indeed
a
pleasure
I
did
not
expect
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
very
nice
place
you
have
here
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
,
pretty
well
,
"
replied
Bob
Sawyer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
PASSED
,
soon
after
that
precious
party
,
and
my
friends
came
down
with
the
needful
for
this
business
;
so
I
put
on
a
black
suit
of
clothes
,
and
a
pair
of
spectacles
,
and
came
here
to
look
as
solemn
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
a
very
snug
little
business
you
have
,
no
doubt
?
"
said
Mr
Winkle
knowingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
,
"
replied
Bob
Sawyer
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
snug
,
that
at
the
end
of
a
few
years
you
might
put
all
the
profits
in
a
wine
-
glass
,
and
cover
'em
over
with
a
gooseberry
leaf
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
surely
mean
that
?
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
stock
itself
---
"
"
Dummies

my
dear
boy
,
"
said
Bob
Sawyer
;
"
half
the
drawers
have
nothing
in
'em

and
the
other
half
do

open

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense

"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fact

honour
!
<EOS>
"
returned
Bob
Sawyer
,
stepping
out
into
the
shop
,
and
demonstrating
the
veracity
of
the
assertion
by
divers
hard
pulls
at
the
little
gilt
knobs
on
the
counterfeit
drawers
.
"
<EOS>
Hardly
anything
real
in
the
shop

<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
have
thought
it
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mr
Winkle
,
much
surprised
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
replied
Bob
Sawyer
,
"
<EOS>
else
where
's
the
use
of
appearances
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
But
what
will
you
take

<EOS>
Do

we
do

That
's
right

Ben

my
fine

out

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
smiled
his
readiness
,
and
produced
from
the
closet
at
his
elbow
a
black
bottle
half
full
of
brandy
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
take
water
,
of
course
?
"
said
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
rather
early
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
qualify
it
,
if
you
have
no
objection
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
None
in
the
least
,
if
you
can
reconcile
it
to
your
conscience

"
replied
Bob
Sawyer
,
tossing
off
,
as
he
spoke
,
a
glass
of
the
liquor
with
great
relish
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ben
,
the
pipkin
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
drew
forth
,
from
the
same
hiding
-
place
,
a
small
brass
pipkin
,
which
Bob
Sawyer
observed
he
prided
himself
upon
,
particularly
because
it
looked
so
business
-
like
.
 
<EOS>
The
water
in
the
professional
pipkin
having
been
made
to
boil
,
in
course
of
time
,
by
various
little
shovelfuls
of
coal
,
which
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
took
out
of
a
practicable
window
-
seat
,
labelled
"
Soda
Water
,
"
Mr
Winkle
adulterated
his
brandy
;
and
the
conversation
was
becoming
general
,
when
it
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
into
the
shop
of
a
boy
,
in
a
sober
gray
livery
and
a
gold
-
laced
hat
,
with
a
small
covered
basket
under
his
arm
,
whom
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
immediately
hailed
with
,
"
Tom
,
you
vagabond
,
come
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
boy
presented
himself
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
've
been
stopping
to
"
over
"
all
the
posts
in
Bristol

idle

"
said
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
No

sir
,
I
have
n't
,
"
replied
the
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
not
!
"
said
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
with
a
threatening
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
do
you
suppose
will
ever
employ
a
professional
man
,
when
they
see
his

playing
at
marbles
in

gutter
,
or
flying
the

<EOS>
Have
you
no

Then
shut

the

<EOS>
"

said
Mr
Winkle
,
as
the

retired

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
peeped
into
the
shop
to
see
that
no
stranger
was
within
hearing
,
and
leaning
forward
to
Mr
Winkle
,
said
,
in
a
low
tone
---
   
<EOS>
"
He

it
all
at

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
looked
perplexed
,
and
Bob
Sawyer
and
his
friend
laughed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
see
?
"
said
Bob
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
goes
up
to
a
house

rings
the

bell
,
pokes
a
packet
of

into

The

Dear

observed
Mr

;
"
what
an
excellent
plan
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Ben
and
I
have
hit
upon
a

replied
Bob

,
with
great
glee
.
 
<EOS>
"
The

eighteenpence

and
my

always
rushes
into
the
church
just
before
the
psalms
,
when
the
people
have
got
nothing
to
do
but
look
about
'em
,
and
calls
me
out
,
with
horror
and
dismay
depicted
on
his
countenance

<EOS>

late

sent

<EOS>
What
a
business
that
young
man
has
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
At
the
termination
of
this
disclosure
of
some
of
the
mysteries
of
medicine
,
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
and
his
friend
,
Ben
Allen
,
threw
themselves
back
in
their
respective
chairs
,
and
laughed
boisterously
.
<EOS>
When
they
had
enjoyed
the
joke
to
their
heart
's
content
,
the
discourse
changed
to
topics
in
which
Mr
Winkle
was
more
immediately
interested
.
   
<EOS>
We
think
we
have
hinted
elsewhere
,
that
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
had
a
way
of
becoming
sentimental
after
brandy
.
 
<EOS>
The
case
is
not
a
peculiar
one
,
as
we
ourself
can
testify
,
having
,
on
a
few
occasions
,
had
to
deal
with
patients
who
have
been
afflicted
in
a
similar
manner
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
precise
period
of
his
existence
,
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
had
perhaps
a
greater
predisposition
to
maudlinism
than
he
had
ever
known
before
;
the
cause
of
which
malady
was
briefly
this
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
staying
nearly
three
weeks
with
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
;
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
was
not
remarkable
for
temperance
,
nor
was
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
for
the
ownership
of
a
very
strong
head
;
the
consequence
was
that
,
during
the
whole
space
of
time
just
mentioned
,
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
had
been
wavering
between
intoxication
partial
,
and
intoxication
complete
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
"
said
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
taking
advantage
of
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
's
temporary
absence
behind
the
counter
<EOS>
,
whither
he
had
retired
to
dispense
some
of
the
second
-
hand
leeches
,
previously
referred
to
;
"
my
dear
friend
,
I
am
very
miserable
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
professed
his
heartfelt
regret
to
hear
it
,
and
begged
to
know
whether
he
could
do
anything
to
alleviate
the
sorrows
of
the
suffering
student
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
my
dear
boy
,
nothing
,
"
said
Ben
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
recollect
Arabella
,
Winkle
?
 
<EOS>
My
sister
Arabella
---
a
little
girl
,
Winkle
,
with
black
eyes
---
when
we
were
down
at
Wardle
's
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
happened
to
notice
her
---
a
nice
little
girl
,
Winkle
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
my
features
may
recall
her
countenance
to
your
recollection
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
required
nothing
to
recall
the
charming
Arabella
to
his
mind
;
and
it
was
rather
fortunate
he
did
not
,
for
the
features
of
her
brother
Benjamin
would
unquestionably
have
proved
but
an
indifferent
refresher
to
his
memory
.
 
<EOS>
He
answered
,
with
as
much
calmness
as
he
could
assume
,
that
he
perfectly
remembered
the
young
lady
referred
to
,
and
sincerely
trusted
she
was
in
good
health
.
   
<EOS>
"
Our
friend
Bob
is
a
delightful
fellow
,
Winkle
,
"
was
the
only
reply
of
Mr
Ben
Allen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
not
much
relishing
this
close
connection
of
the
two
names
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
designed
'em
for
each
other
;
they
were
made
for
each
other
,
sent
into
the
world
for
each
other
,
born
for
each
other
,
Winkle
,
"
said
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
setting
down
his
glass
with
emphasis
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
special
destiny
in
the
matter
,
my
dear
sir
;
there
's
only
five
years
"
difference
between
'em
,
and
both
their
birthdays
are
in
August
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
was
too
anxious
to
hear
what
was
to
follow
to
express
much
wonderment
at
this
extraordinary
coincidence
,
marvellous
as
it
was
;
so
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
after
a
tear
or
two
,
went
on
to
say
that
,
notwithstanding
all
his
esteem
and
respect
and
veneration
for
his
friend
,
Arabella
had
unaccountably
and
undutifully
evinced
the
most
determined
antipathy
to
his
person
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
think
,
"
said
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
in
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
's
a
prior
attachment
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
idea
who
the
object
of
it
might
be
?
"
asked
Mr
Winkle
,
with
great
trepidation
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Ben
Allen
seized
the
poker
,
flourished
it
in
a
warlike
manner
above
his
head
,
inflicted
a
savage
blow
on
an
imaginary
skull
,
and
wound
up
by
saying
,
in
a
very
expressive
manner
,
that
he
only
wished
he
could
guess
;
that
was
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'd
show
him
what
I
thought
of
him
,
"
said
Mr
Ben
Allen
.
<EOS>
And
round
went
the
poker
again
,
more
fiercely
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
was
,
of
course
,
very
soothing
to
the
feelings
of
Mr
Winkle
,
who
remained
silent
for
a
few
minutes
;
but
at
length
mustered
up
resolution
to
inquire
whether
Miss
Allen
was
in
Kent
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
laying
aside
the
poker
,
and
looking
very
cunning
;
"
I
did
n't
think
Wardle
's
exactly
the
place
for
a
headstrong
girl
;
so
,
as
I
am
her
natural
protector
and
guardian
,
our
parents
being
dead
,
I
have
brought
her
down
into
this
part
of
the
country
to
spend
a
few
months
at
an
old
aunt
's
,
in
a
nice
,
dull
,
close
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
will
cure
her
,
my
boy
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
does
n't
,
I
'll
take
her
abroad
for
a
little
while
,
and
see
what
that
'll
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
the
aunt
's
is
in
Bristol
,
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
faltered
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
not
in
Bristol
,
"
replied
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
right
shoulder
;
"
over
that
way
---
down
there
.
<EOS>
But
,
hush
,
here
's
Bob
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
word
,
my
dear
friend
,
not
a
word
.
"
   
<EOS>
Short
as
this
conversation
was
,
it
roused
in
Mr
Winkle
the
highest
degree
of
excitement
and
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
The
suspected
prior
attachment
rankled
in
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Could
he
be
the
object
of
it
?
<EOS>
Could
it
be
for
him
that
the
fair
Arabella
had
looked
scornfully
on
the
sprightly
Bob
Sawyer
,
or
had
he
a
successful
rival
?
 
<EOS>
He
determined
to
see
her
,
cost
what
it
might
;
but
here
an
insurmountable
objection
presented
itself
,
for
whether
the
explanatory
"
over
that
way
,
"
and
"
down
there
,
"
of
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
meant
three
miles
off
,
or
thirty
,
or
three
hundred
,
he
could
in
no
wise
guess
.
   
<EOS>
But
he
had
no
opportunity
of
pondering
over
his
love
just
then
,
for
Bob
Sawyer
's
return
was
the
immediate
precursor
of
the
arrival
of
a
meat
-
pie
from
the
baker
's
,
of
which
that
gentleman
insisted
on
his
staying
to
partake
.
 
<EOS>
The
cloth
was
laid
by
an
occasional
charwoman
,
who
officiated
in
the
capacity
of
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
's
housekeeper
;
and
a
third
knife
and
fork
having
been
borrowed
from
the
mother
of
the
boy
in
the
gray
livery
(
for
Mr
Sawyer
's
domestic
arrangements
were
as
yet
conducted
on
a
limited
scale
)
,
they
sat
down
to
dinner
;
the
beer
being
served
up
,
as
Mr
Sawyer
remarked
,
"
in
its
native
pewter
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
dinner
,
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
ordered
in
the
largest
mortar
in
the
shop
,
and
proceeded
to
brew
a
reeking
jorum
of
rum
-
punch
therein
,
stirring
up
and
amalgamating
the
materials
with
a
pestle
in
a
very
creditable
and
apothecary
-
like
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sawyer
,
being
a
bachelor
,
had
only
one
tumbler
in
the
house
,
which
was
assigned
to
Mr
Winkle
as
a
compliment
to
the
visitor
,
Mr
Ben
Allen
being
accommodated
with
a
funnel
with
a
cork
in
the
narrow
end
,
and
Bob
Sawyer
contented
himself
with
one
of
those
wide
-
lipped
crystal
vessels
inscribed
with
a
variety
of
cabalistic
characters
,
in
which
chemists
are
wo
nt
to
measure
out
their
liquid
drugs
in
compounding
prescriptions
.
 
<EOS>
These
preliminaries
adjusted
,
the
punch
was
tasted
,
and
pronounced
excellent
;
and
it
having
been
arranged
that
Bob
Sawyer
and
Ben
Allen
should
be
considered
at
liberty
to
fill
twice
to
Mr
Winkle
's
once
<EOS>
,
they
started
fair
,
with
great
satisfaction
and
good
-
fellowship
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
singing
,
because
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
said
it
would
n't
look
professional
;
but
to
make
amends
for
this
deprivation
there
was
so
much
talking
and
laughing
that
it
might
have
been
heard
,
and
very
likely
was
,
at
the
end
of
the
street

Which
conversation
materially
lightened
the
hours
and
improved
the
mind
of
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
's
boy
,
who
,
instead
of
devoting
the
evening
to
his
ordinary
occupation
of
writing
his
name
on
the
counter
,
and
rubbing
it
out
again
,
peeped
through
the
glass
door
,
and
thus
listened
and
looked
on
at
the
same
time
.
   
<EOS>
The
mirth
of
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
was
rapidly
ripening
into
the
furious
,
Mr
Ben
Allen
was
fast
relapsing
into
the
sentimental
,
and
the
punch
had
well
-
nigh
disappeared
altogether
,
when
the
boy
hastily
running
in
,
announced
that
a
young
woman
had
just
come
over
,
to
say
that
Sawyer
late
Nockemorf
was
wanted
directly
,
a
couple
of
streets
off
.
 
<EOS>
This
broke
up
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
understanding
the
message
,
after
some
twenty
repetitions
,
tied
a
wet
cloth
round
his
head
to
sober
himself
,
and
,
having
partially
succeeded
,
put
on
his
green
spectacles
and
issued
forth
.
<EOS>
Resisting
all
entreaties
to
stay
till
he
came
back
,
and
finding
it
quite
impossible
to
engage
Mr
Ben
Allen
in
any
intelligible
conversation
on
the
subject
nearest
his
heart
,
or
indeed
on
any
other
,
Mr
Winkle
took
his
departure
,
and
returned
to
the
Bush
.
   
<EOS>
The
anxiety
of
his
mind
,
and
the
numerous
meditations
which
Arabella
had
awakened
,
prevented
his
share
of
the
mortar
of
punch
producing
that
effect
upon
him
which
it
would
have
had
under
other
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
after
taking
a
glass
of
soda
-
water
and
brandy
at
the
bar
,
he
turned
into
the
coffee
-
room
,
dispirited
rather
than
elevated
by
the
occurrences
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Sitting
in
front
of
the
fire
,
with
his
back
towards
him
,
was
a
tallish
gentleman
in
a
greatcoat
:
the
only
other
occupant
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
rather
a
cool
evening
for
the
season
of
the
year
,
and
the
gentleman
drew
his
chair
aside
to
afford
the
new
-
comer
a
sight
of
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
What
were
Mr
Winkle
's
feelings
when
,
in
doing
so
,
he
disclosed
to
view
the
face
and
figure
of
the
vindictive
and
sanguinary
Dowler
!
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
's
first
impulse
was
to
give
a
violent
pull
at
the
nearest
bell
-
handle
,
but
that
unfortunately
happened
to
be
immediately
behind
Mr
Dowler
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
made
one
step
towards
it
,
before
he
checked
himself
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
,
Mr
Dowler
very
hastily
drew
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Winkle
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
Be
calm
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
strike
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
blow
!
 
<EOS>
Never
!
"
said
Mr
Dowler
,
looking
meeker
than
Mr
Winkle
had
expected
in
a
gentleman
of
his
ferocity
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
blow
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
stammered
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
blow
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Dowler
.
 
<EOS>
"
Compose
your
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
Sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
Hear
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
trembling
from
head
to
foot
,
"
before
I
consent
to
sit
down
beside
,
or
opposite
you
,
without
the
presence
of
a
waiter
,
I
must
be
secured
by
some
further
understanding
.
<EOS>
You
used
a
threat
against
me
last
night
,
Sir
,
a
dreadful
threat
,
Sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Winkle
turned
very
pale
indeed
,
and
stopped
short
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
"
said
Dowler
,
with
a
countenance
almost
as
white
as
Mr
Winkle
's
.
 
<EOS>
"
Circumstances
were
suspicious
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
been
explained
.
 
<EOS>
I
respect
your
bravery
.
 
<EOS>
Your
feeling
is
upright
.
<EOS>
Conscious
innocence
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Grasp
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
hesitating
whether
to
give
his
hand
or
not
,
and
almost
fearing
that
it
was
demanded
in
order
that
he
might
be
taken
at
an
advantage
,
"
really
,
Sir
,
I
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
you
mean
,
"
interposed
Dowler
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
feel
aggrieved
.
 
<EOS>
Very
natural
.
 
<EOS>
So
should
I.
 
<EOS>
I
was
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
Be
friendly
.
 
<EOS>
Forgive
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
Dowler
fairly
forced
his
hand
upon
Mr
Winkle
,
and
shaking
it
with
the
utmost
vehemence
,
declared
he
was
a
fellow
of
extreme
spirit
,
and
he
had
a
higher
opinion
of
him
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Dowler
,
"
sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
Relate
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
How
did
you
find
me
?
 
<EOS>
When
did
you
follow
?
 
<EOS>
Be
frank
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
accidental
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
,
greatly
perplexed
by
the
curious
and
unexpected
nature
of
the
interview
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Glad
of
it
,
"
said
Dowler
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
woke
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
forgotten
my
threat
.
 
<EOS>
I
laughed
at
the
accident
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
friendly
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
To
whom
?
"
inquired
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
Mrs
Dowler
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
made
a
vow
,
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
"
said
I.
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
rash
one
,
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
apologise
.
<EOS>
Where
is
he
?
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
inquired
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
,
"
replied
Dowler
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
went
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
not
to
be
found
.
 
<EOS>
Pickwick
looked
gloomy
.
 
<EOS>
Shook
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
Hoped
no
violence
would
be
committed
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
You
felt
yourself
insulted
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
gone
,
for
a
friend
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
Possibly
for
pistols
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
High
spirit
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
admire
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
Mr
Winkle
coughed
,
and
beginning
to
see
how
the
land
lay
,
assumed
a
look
of
importance
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
left
a
note
for
you
,
"
resumed
Dowler
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
said
I
was
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
Pressing
business
called
me
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
not
satisfied
.
<EOS>
You
followed
.
 
<EOS>
You
required
a
verbal
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
right
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
over
now
.
 
<EOS>
My
business
is
finished
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
back
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Join
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Dowler
progressed
in
his
explanation
,
Mr
Winkle
's
countenance
grew
more
and
more
dignified
.
 
<EOS>
The
mysterious
nature
of
the
commencement
of
their
conversation
was
explained
;
Mr
Dowler
had
as
great
an
objection
to
duelling
as
himself
;
in
short
,
this
blustering
and
awful
personage
was
one
of
the
most
egregious
cowards
in
existence
,
and
interpreting
Mr
Winkle
's
absence
through
the
medium
of
his
own
fears
,
had
taken
the
same
step
as
himself
,
and
prudently
retired
until
all
excitement
of
feeling
should
have
subsided
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
real
state
of
the
case
dawned
upon
Mr
Winkle
's
mind
,
he
looked
very
terrible
,
and
said
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
;
but
at
the
same
time
,
said
so
with
an
air
that
left
Mr
Dowler
no
alternative
but
to
infer
that
if
he
had
not
been
,
something
most
horrible
and
destructive
must
inevitably
have
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dowler
appeared
to
be
impressed
with
a
becoming
sense
of
Mr
Winkle
's
magnanimity
and
condescension
;
and
the
two
belligerents
parted
for
the
night
,
with
many
protestations
of
eternal
friendship
.
   
<EOS>
About
half
-
past
twelve
o'clock
,
when
Mr
Winkle
had
been
revelling
some
twenty
minutes
in
the
full
luxury
of
his
first
sleep
<EOS>
,
he
was
suddenly
awakened
by
a
loud
knocking
at
his
chamber
door
,
which
,
being
repeated
with
increased
vehemence
,
caused
him
to
start
up
in
bed
,
and
inquire
who
was
there
,
and
what
the
matter
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
Please
,
Sir
,
here
's
a
young
man
which
says
he
must
see
you
directly
,
"
responded
the
voice
of
the
chambermaid
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
young
man
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
mistake
about
that
'
ere
,
Sir
,
"
replied
another
voice
through
the
keyhole
;
"
and
if
that
wery
same
interestin
'
young
creetur
ai
n't
let
in
vithout
delay
,
it
's
wery
possible
as
his
legs
vill
enter
afore
his
countenance
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
young
man
gave
a
gentle
kick
at
one
of
the
   
lower
panels
of
the
door
,
after
he
had
given
utterance
to
this
hint
,
as
if
to
add
force
and
point
to
the
remark
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
you
,
Sam
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Winkle
,
springing
out
of
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
unpossible
to
identify
any
gen'l'm'n
vith
<EOS>
any
degree
o
'
mental
satisfaction
,
vithout
lookin
'
at
him
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
voice
dogmatically
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
,
not
much
doubting
who
the
young
man
was
,
unlocked
the
door
;
which
he
had
no
sooner
done
than
Mr
Samuel
Weller
entered
with
great
precipitation
,
and
carefully
relocking
it
on
the
inside
,
deliberately
put
the
key
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
;
and
,
after
surveying
Mr
Winkle
from
head
to
foot
,
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
wery
humorous
young
gen'l'm'n
,
you
air
,
Sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
this
conduct
,
Sam
?
"
inquired
Mr
Winkle
indignantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Get
out
,
sir
,
this
instant
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
I
mean
,
"
retorted
Sam
;
"
come
,
Sir
,
this
is
rayther
too
rich
,
as
the
young
lady
said
when
she
remonstrated
with
the
pastry
-
cook
,
arter
he
'd
sold
her
a
pork
pie
as
had
got
nothin'
but
fat
inside
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
I
mean
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
that
ai
n't
a
bad
'
un
,
that
ai

.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Unlock
that
door
,
and
leave
this
room
immediately
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
leave
this
here
room
,
sir
,
just
precisely
at
the
wery
same
moment
as
you
leaves
it
,
"
responded
Sam
,
speaking
in
a
forcible
manner
,
and
seating
himself
with
perfect
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
find
it
necessary
to
carry
you
away
,
pick
-
a
-
back
,
o
'
<EOS>
course
I
shall
leave
it
the
least
bit
<EOS>
o
'
time
possible
<EOS>
afore
you
;
but
allow
me
to
express
a
hope
as
you
wo
n't
reduce
me
to
extremities
;
<EOS>
in
saying
wich
,
I
merely
quote
wot
the
nobleman
said
to
the
fractious
pennywinkle
,
ven
<EOS>
he
vouldn't
come
out
of
his
shell
by
means
of
a
pin
,
and
he
conseqvently
began
to
be
afeered
that
he
should
be
obliged
to
crack
him
in
the
parlour
door
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
this
address
,
which
was
unusually
lengthy
for
him
,
Mr
Weller
planted
his
hands
on
his
knees
,
and
looked
full
in
Mr
Winkle
's
face
,
with
an
expression
of
countenance
which
showed
that
he
had
not
the
remotest
intention
of
being
trifled
with
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
amiably
-
disposed
young
man
,
Sir
,
I
do
n't
think
,
"
resumed
Mr
Weller
,
in
a
tone
of
moral
reproof
,
"
to
go
inwolving
our
precious
governor
in
all
sorts
o
'
fanteegs
,
wen
he
's
made
up
his
mind
to
go
through
everythink
for
principle
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
far
worse
nor
Dodson
,
Sir
;
and
as
for
Fogg
,
I
consider
him
a
born
angel
to
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
having
accompanied
this
last
sentiment
with
an
emphatic
slap
on
each
knee
,
folded
his
arms
with
a
look
of
great
disgust
,
and
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
as
if
awaiting
the
criminal
's
defence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
good
fellow
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
extending
his
hand
---
<EOS>
his
teeth
chattering
all
the
time
he
spoke
,
for
he
had
been
standing
,
during
the
whole
of
Mr
Weller
's
lecture
,
in
his
night
-
gear
---
"
my
good
fellow
<EOS>
,
I
respect
your
attachment
to
my
excellent
friend
,
and
I
am
very
sorry
indeed
to
have
added
to
his
causes
for
disquiet
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
Sam
,
there
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Sam
,
rather
sulkily
,
but
giving
the
proffered
hand
a
respectful
shake
at
the
same
time
---
"
<EOS>
well
,
so
you
ought
to
be
,
and
I
am
very
glad
to
find
you
air
;
for
,
if
I
can
help
it
,
I
wo
n't
have
him
put
upon
by
nobody

and
that
's
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
!
 
<EOS>
Now
go
to
bed
,
Sam
,
and
we
'll
talk
further
about
this
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
wery
sorry

"
said
Sam
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
ca
n't
go
to

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
go
to

"
<EOS>
repeated
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
No

said
Sam
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
be
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
're
going
back
to
-
night
,
Sam
?
"
urged
Mr
Winkle
,
greatly
surprised
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
unless
you
particklerly
wish
it
,
"
replied
Sam
;
"

<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
"
I
must
stop
here
two
or
three
days
;
and
more
than
that
<EOS>
,
Sam
,
you
must
stop
here
too
,
to
assist
me
in
gaining
an
interview
with
a
young
lady
---
Miss
Allen
,
Sam
;
you
remember
her
---
whom
I
must
and
will
see
before
I
leave
Bristol
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
in
reply
to
each
of
these
positions
,
Sam
shook
his
head
with
great
firmness
,
and
energetically
replied
,
"
It
ca
n't
be
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
great
deal
of
argument
and
representation
on
the
part
of
Mr
Winkle
,
however
,
and
a
full
disclosure
of
what
had
passed
in
the
interview
with
Dowler
,
Sam
began
to
waver
;
and
at
length
a
compromise
was
effected
,
of
which
the
following
were
the
main
and
principal
conditions
:
---
   
That
Sam
should
retire
,
and
leave
Mr
Winkle
in
the
undisturbed
possession
of
his
apartment
,
on
the
condition
that
he
had
permission
to
lock
the
door
on
the
outside
,
and
carry
off
the
key
;
provided
always
,
that
in
the
event
of
an
alarm
of
fire
,
or
other
dangerous
contingency
,
the
door
should
be
instantly
unlocked
.
<EOS>
That
a
letter
should
be
written
to
Mr
Pickwick
early
next
morning
,
and
forwarded
per
Dowler
,
requesting
his
consent
to
<EOS>
Sam
and
Mr
Winkle
's
remaining
at
Bristol
,
for
the
purpose
and
with
the
object
already
assigned
,
and
begging
an
answer
by
the
next
coach
<EOS>
---
,
if
favourable
,
the
aforesaid
parties
to
remain
accordingly
,
and
if
not
,
to
return
to
Bath
immediately
on
the
receipt
thereof
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
lastly
,
that
Mr
Winkle
should
be
understood
as
distinctly
pledging
himself
not
to
resort
to
the
window
,
fireplace
,
or
other
surreptitious
mode
of
escape
in
the
meanwhile
.
<EOS>
These
stipulations
having
been
concluded
,
Sam
locked
the
door
and
departed
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
nearly
got
downstairs
,
when
he
stopped
,
and
drew
the
key
from
his
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
quite
forgot
about
the
knockin
'
down
,
"
said
Sam
,
half
turning
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
governor
distinctly
said
it
was
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
Amazin
'
stupid
o
'
me
,
that
'
ere
!
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
,
"
said
Sam
,
brightening
up
,
"
it
's
easily
done
to
-
morrow
,
anyvays
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Apparently
much
consoled
by
this
reflection
,
Mr
Weller
once
more
deposited
the
key
in
his
pocket
,
and
descending
the
remainder
of
the
stairs
without
any
fresh
visitations
of
conscience
,
was
soon
,
in
common
with
the
other
inmates
of
the
house
,
buried
in
profound
repose
.

Chapter
39
.
<EOS>
Mr
Samuel
Weller
,
being
intrusted
with
a
mission
of
love
,
proceeds
to
execute
it
;
with
what
success
will
hereinafter
appear
 
During
the
whole
of
next
day
,
Sam
kept
Mr
Winkle
steadily
in
sight
,
fully
determined
not
to
take
his
eyes
off
him
for
one
instant
,
until
he
should
receive
express
instructions
from
the
fountain
-
head
.
 
<EOS>
However
disagreeable
Sam
's
very
close
watch
and
great
vigilance
were
to
Mr
Winkle
,
he
thought
it
better
to
bear
with
them
,
than
,
by
any
act
of
violent
opposition
,
to
hazard
being
carried
away
by
force
,
which
Mr
Weller
more
than
once
strongly
hinted
was
the
line
of
conduct
that
a
strict
sense
of
duty
prompted
him
to
pursue
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
little
reason
to
doubt
that
Sam
would
very
speedily
have
quieted
his
scruples
,
by
bearing
Mr
Winkle
back
to
Bath
,
bound
hand
and
foot
,
had
not
Mr
Pickwick
's
prompt
attention
to
the
note
,
which
Dowler
had
undertaken
to
deliver
,
forestalled
any
such
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
Mr
Pickwick
himself
walked
into
the
coffee
-
room
of
the
Bush
Tavern
,
and
told
Sam
with
a
smile
,
to
his
very
great
relief
,
that
he
had
done
quite
right
,
and
it
was
unnecessary
for
him
to
mount
guard
any
longer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
better
to
come
myself
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
addressing
Mr
Winkle
,
as
Sam
disencumbered
him
of
his
great
-
coat
and
travelling
-
shawl
,
"
to
ascertain
,
before
I
gave
my
consent
to
Sam
's
employment
in
this
matter
,
that
you
are
quite
in
earnest
and
serious
,
with
respect
to
this
young
lady
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Serious
,
from
my
heart
---
from
my
soul
!
"
returned
Mr
Winkle
,
with
great
energy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Remember
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
beaming
eyes
,
"
we
met
her
at
our
excellent
and
hospitable
friend
's
,
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
an
ill
return
to
tamper
lightly
,
and
without
due
consideration
,
with
this
young
lady
's
affections
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
not
allow
that
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
not
allow
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
such
intention
,
indeed
,
"
exclaimed
Mr
Winkle
warmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
considered
the
matter
well
,
for
a
long
time
,
and
I
feel
that
my
happiness
is
bound
up
in
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
wot
we
call
tying
it
up
in
a
small
parcel
,
sir
,
"
interposed
Mr
Weller
,
with
an
agreeable
smile
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
looked
somewhat
stern
at
this
interruption
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
angrily
requested
his
attendant
not
to
jest
with
one
of
the
best
feelings
of
our
nature
;
to
which
Sam
replied
,
"
That
he
would
n't
,
if
he
was
aware
on
it
;
but
there
were
so
many
on
'em
,
that
he
hardly
know'd
<EOS>
which
was
the
best
ones
wen
he
heerd
'em
mentioned
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
then
recounted
what
had
passed
between
himself
and
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
relative
to
Arabella
;
stated
that
his
object
was
to
gain
an
interview
with
the
young
lady
,
and
make
a
formal
disclosure
of
his
passion
;
and
declared
his
conviction
,
founded
on
certain
dark
hints
and
mutterings
of
the
aforesaid
Ben
,
that
,
wherever
she
was
at
present
immured
,
it
was
somewhere
near
the
Downs
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
was
his
whole
stock
of
knowledge
or
suspicion
on
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
With
this
very
slight
clue
to
guide
him
,
it
was
determined
that
Mr
Weller
should
start
next
morning
on
an
expedition
of
discovery
;
it
was
also
arranged
that
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Winkle
,
who
were
less
confident
of
their
powers
,
should
parade
the
town
meanwhile
,
and
accidentally
drop
in
upon
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
in
the
course
of
the
day
,
in
the
hope
of
seeing
or
hearing
something
of
the
young
lady
's
whereabouts
.
   
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
next
morning
,
Sam
Weller
issued
forth
upon
his
quest
,
in
no
way
daunted
by
the
very
discouraging
prospect
before
him
;
and
away
he
walked
,
up
one
street
and
down
another
 
<EOS>
---
we
were
going
to
say
,
up
one
hill
and
down
another
,
only
it
's
all
uphill
at
Clifton
---
without
meeting
with
anything
or
anybody
that
tended
to
throw
the
faintest
light
on
the
matter
in
hand
.
<EOS>
Many
were
the
colloquies
into
which
Sam
entered
with
grooms
who
were
airing
horses
on
roads
,
and
nursemaids
who
were
airing
children
in
lanes
;
but
nothing
could
Sam
elicit
from
either
the
first
-
mentioned
or
the
last
,
which
bore
the
slightest
reference
to
the
object
of
his
artfully
-
prosecuted
inquiries
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
a
great
many
young
ladies
in
a
great
many
houses
,
the
greater
part
whereof
were
shrewdly
suspected
by
the
male
and
female
domestics
to
be
deeply
attached
to
somebody
,
or
perfectly
ready
to
become
so
,
if
opportunity
afforded
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
none
among
these
young
ladies
was
Miss
Arabella
Allen
,
the
information
left
Sam
at
exactly
the
old
point
of
wisdom
at
which
he
had
stood
before
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
struggled
across
the
Downs
against
a
good
high
wind
,
wondering
whether
it
was
always
necessary
to
hold
your
hat
on
with
both
hands
in
that
part
of
the
country
,
and
came
to
a
shady
by
-
place
,
about
which
were
sprinkled
several
little
villas
of
quiet
and
secluded
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Outside
a
stable
door
at
the
bottom
of
a
long
back
lane
without
a
thoroughfare
,
a
groom
in
undress
was
idling
about
,
apparently
persuading
himself
that
he
was
doing
something
with
a
spade
and
a
wheel
-
barrow
.
 
<EOS>
We
may
remark
,
in
this
place
,
that
we
have
scarcely
ever
seen
a
groom
near
a
stable
,
in
his
lazy
moments
,
who
has
not
been
,
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
,
the
victim
of
this
singular
delusion
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
thought
he
might
as
well
talk
to
this
groom
as
to
any
one
else
,
especially
as
he
was
very
tired
with
walking
,
and
there
was
a
good
large
stone
just
opposite
the
wheel
-
barrow
;
so
he
strolled
down
the
lane
,
and
,
seating
himself
on
the
stone
,
opened
a
conversation
with
the
ease
and
freedom
for
which
he
was
remarkable
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mornin
'
,
old
friend
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Arternoon
,
you
mean
,
"
replied
the
groom
,
casting
a
surly
look
at
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
wery
right
,
old
friend
,
"
said
Sam
;
"
I
DO
mean
arternoon
.
<EOS>
How
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
do
n't
find
myself
much
the
better
for
seeing
of
you
,
"
replied
the
ill
-
tempered
groom
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
wery
odd
---
that
is
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
<EOS>
for
you
look
so
uncommon
cheerful
,
and
seem
altogether
so
lively
,
that
it
does
vun
's
heart
good
to
see
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
surly
groom
looked
surlier
still
at
this
,
but
not
sufficiently
so
to
produce
any
effect
upon
Sam
,
who
immediately
inquired
,
with
a
countenance
of
great
anxiety
,
whether
his
master
's
name
was
not
Walker
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
ai
n't
,
"
said
the
groom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
Brown
,
I
s'pose
?
<EOS>
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
ai
n't

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
Vilson
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
;
nor
that
@ither
,
"
said
the
groom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
"
replied
Sam
,
"
<EOS>
then
I
'm
mistaken
,
and
he
has
n't
got
the
honour
<EOS>
o
'
my
acquaintance
,
which
I
thought
he
had
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
wait
here
out
o
'
compliment
to
me
,
"
said
Sam
,
as
the
groom
wheeled
in
the
barrow
,
and
prepared
to
shut
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ease
afore
ceremony
,
old
boy
<EOS>
;
I
'll
excuse
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'd
knock
your
head
off
for
half
-
a
-
crown
,
"
said
the
surly
groom
,
bolting
one
half
of
the
gate
.
   
<EOS>
"
Could
n't
afford
to
have
it
done
on
those
terms
,
"
rejoined
Sam
.
<EOS>
"
It
'
ud
be
worth
a
life
's
board
wages
at
least
,
to
you
,
and
'
ud
be
cheap
at
that
.
 
<EOS>
Make
my
compliments
indoors
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
'em
not
to
vait
dinner
for
me
,
and
say
they
need
n't
mind
puttin
'
any
by
,
for
it
'll
be
<EOS>
cold
afore
<EOS>
I
come
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
reply
to
this
,
the
groom
waxing
very
wroth
,
muttered
a
desire
to
damage
somebody
's
person
;
but
disappeared
without
carrying
it
into
execution
,
slamming
the
door
angrily
after
him
,
and
wholly
unheeding
Sam
's
affectionate
request
,
that
he
would
leave
him
a
lock
of
his
hair
before
he
went
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
continued
to
sit
on
the
large
stone
,
meditating
upon
what
was
best
to
be
done
,
and
revolving
in
his
mind
a
plan
for
knocking
at
all
the
doors
within
five
miles
of
Bristol
,
taking
them
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
or
two
hundred
a
day
,
and
endeavouring
to
find
Miss
Arabella
by
that
expedient
,
when
accident
all
of
a
sudden
threw
in
his
way
what
he
might
have
sat
there
for
a
twelvemonth
and
yet
not
found
without
it
.
   
<EOS>
Into
the
lane
where
he
sat
,
there
opened
three
or
four
garden
gates
,
belonging
to
as
many
houses
,
which
though
detached
from
each
other
,
were
only
separated
by
their
gardens
.
 
<EOS>
As
these
were
large
and
long
,
and
well
planted
with
trees
,
the
houses
were
not
only
at
some
distance
off
,
but
the
greater
part
of
them
were
nearly
concealed
from
view
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
was
sitting
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
dust
-
heap
outside
the
next
gate
to
that
by
which
the
groom
had
disappeared
,
profoundly
turning
over
in
his
mind
the
difficulties
of
his
present
undertaking
,
when
the
gate
opened
,
and
a
female
servant
came
out
into
the
lane
to
shake
some
bedside
carpets
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
was
so
very
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
,
that
it
is
probable
he
would
have
taken
no
more
notice
of
the
young
woman
than
just
raising
his
head
and
remarking
that
she
had
a
very
neat
and
pretty
figure
,
if
his
feelings
of
gallantry
had
not
been
most
strongly
roused
by
observing
that
she
had
no
one
to
help
her
,
and
that
the
carpets
seemed
too
heavy
for
her
single
strength
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
was
a
gentleman
of
great
gallantry
in
his
own
way
,
and
he
no
sooner
remarked
this
circumstance
than
he
hastily
rose
from
the
large
stone
,
and
advanced
towards
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
Sam
,
sliding
up
with
an
air
of
great
respect
,
"
you
'll
spile
that
wery
pretty
figure
out
<EOS>
o
'
all
perportion
<EOS>
if
you
shake
them
carpets
by
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
help
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
lady
,
who
had
been
coyly
affecting
not
to
know
that
a
gentleman
was
so
near
,
turned
round
as
Sam
spoke
---
no
doubt
(
indeed
she
said
so
,
afterwards
)
to
decline
this
offer
from
a
perfect
stranger
---
when
instead
of
speaking
,
she
started
back
,
and
uttered
a
half
-
suppressed
scream
.

Sam
was
scarcely
less
staggered
,
for
in
the
countenance
of
the
well
-
shaped
female
servant
,
he
beheld
the
very
features
of
his
valentine
,
the
pretty
housemaid
from
Mr
Nupkins
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wy
,
Mary
,
my
dear
!
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lauk
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
how
you
do
frighten
one
!
"
   
<EOS>
Sam
made
no
verbal
answer
to
this
complaint
,
nor
can
we
precisely
say
what
reply
he
did
make
.
 
<EOS>
We
merely
know
that
after
a
short
pause
Mary
said
,
"
Lor
,
do
adun
,
Mr
Weller
!
"
and
that
his
hat
had
fallen
off
a
few
moments
before
---
from
both
of
which
tokens
<EOS>
we
should
be
disposed
to
infer
that
one
kiss
,
or
more
,
had
passed
between
the
parties
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
did
you
come
here
?
"
said
Mary
,
when
the
conversation
to
which
this
interruption
had
been
offered
,
was
resumed
.
   
<EOS>
"
O
'
course
I
came
to
look
arter
you
,
my
darlin
'
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
;
for
once
permitting
his
passion
to
get
the
better
of
his
veracity
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
did
you
know
<EOS>
I
was
here
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
could
have
told
you
that
I
took
another
service
at
Ipswich
,
and
that
they
afterwards
moved
all
the
way
here
?
 
<EOS>
Who
COULD
have
told
you
that
,
Mr
Weller
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
Sam
,
with
a
cunning
look
,
"
that
's
the
pint
.
 
<EOS>
Who
could
ha
'
told
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
n't
Mr
Muzzle
,
was
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
.
"
 
<EOS>
replied
Sam
,
with
a
solemn
shake
of
the
head
,
"
<EOS>
it
warn't
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
must
have
been
the
cook
,
"
said
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
"
O
'
course
it
must
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
never
heard
the
like
of
that
!
"
exclaimed
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
more
did
I
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
Mary
,
my
dear
"
---
here
Sam
's
manner
grew
extremely
affectionate
---
"
Mary
,
my
dear
,
I
've
got
another
affair
in
hand
as

wery
pressin

<EOS>
There

<EOS>
Mr

"
   
<EOS>
"
Him

said
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh

yes

I
remember
him

"
   
<EOS>
"
Well

"
said
Sam
,
"
he

in

reg'larly
comfoozled

and
done

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lor

"
interposed
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Sam
;
"
but
that
's
nothin'
if
we
could
find
out
the
young
"
ooman
;
"
and
here
Sam
,
with
many
digressions
upon
the
personal
beauty
of
Mary
,
and
the
unspeakable
tortures
he
had
experienced
since
he
last
saw
her
,
gave
a
faithful
account
of
Mr
Winkle
's
present
predicament
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
I
never

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O

not

"
said
Sam
,
"
and
nobody

<EOS>
"
Miss

"
said
Mary
,
in
great
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Arabella
Allen
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Goodness
gracious
!
"
said
Mary
,
pointing
to
the
garden
door
which
the
sulky
groom
had
locked
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
's
that
very
house
;
she
's
been
living
there
these
six
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
Their
upper
house
-
maid
,
which
is
lady's
-
maid
too
,
told
me
all
about
it
over
the
wash

house

before

out

one

<EOS>
"
Wot
,
the
wery
next
door
to
you
?
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
very
next
,
"
replied
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
was
so
deeply
overcome
on
receiving
this
intelligence
that
he
found
it
absolutely
necessary
to
cling
to
his
fair
informant
for
support
;
and
divers
little
love
passages
had
passed
between
them
,
before
he
was
sufficiently
collected
to
return
to
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
"
said
Sam
at
length
,
"
if
this
do
n't
beat
cock
-
fightin
'
nothin'
never
vill
,
as
the
lord
mayor
said
,
<EOS>
ven
<EOS>
the
chief
secretary
o

proposed
his
missis
's
health
arter

.
 
<EOS>
That
wery
next
house
!
 
<EOS>
Wy
,
I
've
got
a
message
to
her
as
I
've
been
a
-
trying
all
day
to
deliver
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
but
<EOS>
you
ca
n't
deliver
it
now
,
because
she
only
walks
in
the
garden
in
the
evening
,
and
then
only
for
a
very
little
time
;
she
never
goes
out
,
without
the
old
lady
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sam
ruminated
for
a
few
moments
,
and
finally
hit
upon
the
following
plan
of
operations
;
that
he
should
return
just
at
dusk
 
---
the
time
at
which
Arabella
invariably
took
her
walk
---
and
,
being
admitted
by
Mary
into
the
garden
of
the
house
to
which
she
belonged
,
would
contrive
to
scramble
up
the
wall
,
beneath
the
overhanging
boughs
of
a
large
pear
-
tree
,
which
would
effectually
screen
him
from
observation
;
would
there
deliver
his
message
,
and
arrange
,
if
possible
,
an
interview
on
behalf
of
Mr
Winkle
for
the
ensuing
evening
at
the
same
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Having
made
this
arrangement
with
great
despatch
,
he
assisted
Mary
in
the
long
-
deferred
occupation
of
shaking
the
carpets
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
not
half
as
innocent
a
thing
as
it
looks
,
that
shaking
little
pieces
of
carpet
---
<EOS>
at
least
,
there
may
be
no
great
harm
in
the
shaking
,
but
the
folding
is
a
very
insidious
process
.
 
<EOS>
So
long
as
the
shaking
lasts
,
and
the
two
parties
are
kept
the
carpet
's
length
apart
,
it
is
as
innocent
an
amusement
as
can
well
be
devised
;
but
when
the
folding
begins
,
and
the
distance
between
them
gets
gradually
lessened
from
one
half
its
former
length
to
a
quarter
,
and
then
to
an
eighth
,
and
then
to
a
sixteenth
,
and
then
to
a
thirty
-
second
,
if
the
carpet
be
long
enough
,
it
becomes
dangerous
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
know
,
to
a
nicety
,
how
many
pieces
of
carpet
were
folded
in
this
instance
,
but
we
can
venture
to
state
that
as
many
pieces
as
there
were
,
so
many
times
did
Sam
kiss
the
pretty
housemaid
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
regaled
himself
with
moderation
at
the
nearest
tavern
until
it
was
nearly
dusk
,
and
then
returned
to
the
lane
without
the
thoroughfare
.
 
<EOS>
Having
been
admitted
into
the
garden
by
Mary
,
and
having
received
from
that
lady
sundry
admonitions
concerning
the
safety
of
his
limbs
and
neck
,
Sam
mounted
into
the
pear
-
tree
,
to
wait
until
Arabella
should
come
into
sight
.
   
<EOS>
He
waited
so
long
without
this
anxiously
-
expected
event
occurring
,
that
he
began
to
think
it
was
not
going
to
take
place
at
all
,
when
he
heard
light
footsteps
upon
the
gravel
,
and
immediately
afterwards
beheld
Arabella
walking
pensively
down
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
came
nearly
below
the
tree
,
Sam
began
,
by
way
of
gently
indicating
his
presence
,
to
make
sundry
diabolical
noises
similar
to
those
which
would
probably
be
natural
to
a
person
of
middle
age
who
had
been
afflicted
with
a
combination
of
inflammatory
sore
throat
,
croup
,
and
whooping
-
cough
,
from
his
earliest
infancy
.
   
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
young
lady
cast
a
hurried
glance
towards
the
spot
whence
the
dreadful
sounds
proceeded
;
and
her
previous
alarm
being
not
at
all
diminished
when
she
saw
a
man
among
the
branches
,
she
would
most
certainly
have
decamped
,
and
alarmed
the
house
,
had
not
fear
fortunately
deprived
her
of
the
power
of
moving
,
and
caused
her
to
sink
down
on
a
garden
seat
,
which
happened
by
good
luck
to
be
near
at
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
-
goin
'
off
,
"
soliloquised
Sam
in
great
perplexity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wot
a
thing
it
is
,
as
these
here
young
creeturs
will
go
<EOS>

faintin

avay

<EOS>
Here
,
young
"
ooman
,
Miss
Sawbones
,
Mrs
Vinkle
,
do
n't
!
"
   
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
the
magic
of
Mr
Winkle
's
name
,
or
the
coolness
of
the
open
air
,
or
some
recollection
of
Mr
Weller
's
voice
,
that
revived
Arabella
,
matters
not
.
 
<EOS>
She
raised
her
head
and
languidly
inquired
,
<EOS>
"
Who
's
that
,
and
what
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Hush
,
"
said
Sam
,
swinging
himself
on
to
the
wall
,
and
crouching
there
in
as
small
a
compass
as
he
could
reduce
himself
to
,
"
only
me
,
miss
,
only
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pickwick
's
servant
!
<EOS>
"
said
Arabella
earnestly
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
wery
same
,
miss
,
"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
Mr
Vinkle
reg'larly
sewed
up
vith
desperation
,
miss
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Arabella
,
drawing
nearer
the
wall
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
indeed
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ve
thought

should

obliged
to
strait

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
no

no

Mr
Weller

<EOS>
"
said
Arabella
,
clasping
her
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
wot
he
says
,
miss
,
"
replied
Sam
coolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
man
of
his
word
,
and
it
's
my
opinion
<EOS>
he
'll
do
it

<EOS>
He
's
heerd
all
about

from
the
sawbones
in
barnacles
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
From
my
brother

"
said
Arabella
,
having
some
faint
recognition
of
Sam
's
description
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
rightly
know
which
is
your
brother

miss
,
"
replied
Sam
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
the
dirtiest
vun
o

the
two
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes

yes

Mr
Weller

"
returned
Arabella
,
"
go
on

<EOS>
Make
haste
,
pray
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
miss
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
he
's
heerd
all
about
it
from
him
;
and
it
's
the
gov'nor

opinion
that

do

see

wery
quick
,
the
sawbones
as
we
've
been

speakin

"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
can
I
do
to
prevent
these
dreadful
quarrels
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Arabella
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
suspicion
of
a
priory
"
tachment
as
is
the
cause
of
it

replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
You

better

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
how

---
<EOS>
where
?
"
cried
Arabella
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
not
leave
the
house
alone
.
 
<EOS>
My
brother
is
so
unkind
,
so
unreasonable
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
how
strange
my
talking
thus
to
you
may
appear
,
Mr
Weller
,
but
I
am
very
,
very
unhappy
---
"
and
here
poor
Arabella
wept
so
bitterly
that
Sam
grew
chivalrous
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
may
seem
wery
strange
talkin
'
to
me
about
these
here
affairs
,
miss
,
"
said
Sam
,
with
great
vehemence
;
"
but
all
I
can
say
is
,
that
I
'm
not
only
ready
but
villin
'
to
do
<EOS>
anythin
'
as'll
make
matters
agreeable
;
and
<EOS>
if
chuckin
'
either
o
'
them
sawboneses
out
<EOS>
o
'
winder
"
ull
do
it
,
I
'm
the
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
Sam
Weller
said
this
,
he
tucked
up
his
wristbands
,
at
the
imminent
hazard
of
falling
off
the
wall
in
so
doing
,
to
intimate
his
readiness
to
set
to
work
immediately
.
   
<EOS>
Flattering
as
these
professions
of
good
feeling
were
,
Arabella
resolutely
declined
(
most
unaccountably
,
as
Sam
thought
)
to
avail
herself
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
For
some
time
she
strenuously
refused
to
grant
Mr
Winkle
<EOS>
the
interview
Sam
had
so
pathetically
requested
;
but
at
length
,
when
the
conversation
threatened
to
be
interrupted
by
the
unwelcome
arrival
of
a
third
party
,
she
hurriedly
gave
him
to
understand
,
with
many
professions
of
gratitude
,
that
it
was
barely
possible
she
might
be
in
the
garden
an
hour
later
,
next
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
understood
this
perfectly
well
;
and
Arabella
,
bestowing
upon
him
one
of
her
sweetest
smiles
,
tripped
gracefully
away
,
leaving
Mr
Weller
in
a
state
of
very
great
admiration
of
her
charms
,
both
personal
and
mental
.
   
<EOS>
Having
descended
in
safety
from
the
wall
,
and
not
forgotten
to
devote
a
few
moments
to
his
own
particular
business
in
the
same
department
,
Mr
Weller
then
made
the
best
of
his
way
back
to
the
Bush
,
where
his
prolonged
absence
had
occasioned
much
speculation
and
some
alarm
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
must
be
careful
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
after
listening
attentively
to
Sam
's
tale
,
"
not
for
our
sakes
,
but
for
that
of
the
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
be
very
cautious
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
WE
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
with
marked
emphasis
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
momentary
look
of
indignation
at
the
tone
of
this
remark
,
subsided
into
his
characteristic
expression
of
benevolence
,
as
he
replied
---
   
<EOS>
"
WE
,
Sir
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
accompany
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
!
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
mildly
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
affording
you
this
interview
,
the
young
lady
has
taken
a
natural
,
perhaps
,
but
still
a
very
imprudent
step
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
am
present
at
the
meeting
---
a
mutual
friend
,
who
is
old
enough
to
be
the
father
of
both
parties
---
the
voice
of
calumny
can
never
be
raised
against
her
hereafter
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
eyes
lightened
with
honest
exultation
at
his
own
foresight
,
as
he
spoke
thus
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
was
touched
by
this
little
trait
of
his
delicate
respect
for
the
young
PROTEGEE
of
his
friend
,
and
took
his
hand
with
a
feeling
of
regard
,
akin
to
veneration
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
SHALL
go
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
have
my
greatcoat
and
shawl
ready
,
and
order
a
conveyance
to
be
at
the
door
to
-
morrow
evening
,
rather
earlier
than
is
absolutely
necessary
,
in
order
that
we
may
be
in
good
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
touched
his
hat
,
as
an
earnest
of
his
obedience
,
and
withdrew
to
make
all
needful
preparations
for
the
expedition
.
   
<EOS>
The
coach
was
punctual
to
the
time
appointed
;
and
Mr
Weller
,
after
duly
installing
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Winkle
inside
,
took
his
seat
on
the
box
by
the
driver
.
 
<EOS>
They
alighted
,
as
had
been
agreed
on
,
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
place
of
rendezvous
,
and
desiring
the
coachman
to
await
their
return
,
proceeded
the
remaining
distance
on
foot
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
at
this
stage
of
the
undertaking
that
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
many
smiles
and
various
other
indications
of
great
self
-
satisfaction
,
produced
from
one
of
his
coat
pockets
a
dark
lantern
,
with
which
he
had
specially
provided
himself
for
the
occasion
,
and
the
great
mechanical
beauty
of
which
he
proceeded
to
explain
to
Mr
Winkle
,
as
they
walked
along
,
to
the
no
small
surprise
of
the
few
stragglers
they
met
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
been
the
better
for
something
of
this
kind
,
in
my
last
garden
expedition
,
at
night
;
eh
,
Sam
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
good
-
humouredly
round
at
his
follower
,
who
was
trudging
behind
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
nice
things
<EOS>
,
if
they
're
managed
properly
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
;
"
but
wen
you
do
n't
want
to
be
seen
,
I
think
they
're
more
useful
arter
<EOS>
the
candle
's
gone
out
,
than
wen
<EOS>
it
's
alight
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
appeared
struck
by
Sam
's
remarks
,
for
he
put
the
lantern
into
his
pocket
again
,
and
they
walked
on
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Down
here
,
Sir
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
lead
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
lane
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Down
the
lane
they
went
,
and
dark
enough
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
brought
out
the
lantern
,
once
or
twice
,
as
they
groped
their
way
along
,
and
threw
a
very
brilliant
little
tunnel
of
light
before
them
,
about
a
foot
in
diameter
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
pretty
to
look
at
,
but
seemed
to
have
the
effect
of
rendering
surrounding
objects
rather
darker
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
they
arrived
at
the
large
stone
.
 
<EOS>
Here
Sam
recommended
his
master
and
Mr
Winkle
to
seat
themselves
,
while
he
reconnoitred
,
and
ascertained
whether
Mary
was
yet
in
waiting
.
   
<EOS>
After
an
absence
of
five
or
ten
minutes
,
Sam
returned
to
say
that
the
gate
was
opened
,
and
all
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
Following
him
with
stealthy
tread
,
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Winkle
soon
found
themselves
in
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
Here
everybody
said
,
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
a
good
many
times
;
and
that
being
done
,
no
one
seemed
to
have
any
very
distinct
apprehension
of
what
was
to
be
done
next
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Miss
Allen
in
the
garden
yet
,
Mary
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Winkle
,
much
agitated
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
pretty
housemaid
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
best
thing
to
be
done
,
sir
,
will
be
for
Mr
Weller
to
give
you
a
hoist
up
into
the
tree
,
and
perhaps
Mr
Pickwick
will
have
the
goodness
to
see
that
nobody
comes
up
the
lane
,
while
I
watch
at
the
other
end
of
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
Goodness
gracious
<EOS>
,
what
's
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
'
ere
blessed
lantern
"
ull
be
the
death
on
us
all
,
"
exclaimed
Sam
peevishly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
care
<EOS>
wot
<EOS>
you
're
a
-
doin
'
on

you

right

parlour
winder

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
turning
hastily
aside
,
"
I
did
n't
mean
to
do
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
it
's
in
the
next
house
,
sir
,
"
remonstrated
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
heart
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
,
turning
round
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
it
's
in
the
stable
,
and
they
'll
think
the
place
is
afire

"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shut
it
up
,
sir
,
ca
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
most
extraordinary
lantern
I
ever
met
with
,
in
all
my
life
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
,
greatly
bewildered
by
the
effects
he
had
so
unintentionally
produced
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
such
a
powerful
reflector
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
'll
be
vun
too
powerful
for
us
,
if
you
keep
blazin
'
avay
in
that
manner

sir
,
"
replied
Sam
,
as
Mr
Pickwick
,
after
various
unsuccessful
efforts
,
managed
to
close
the
slide
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
young
lady
's
footsteps
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr
Winkle
,
sir
,
up

"
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
,
stop
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
I
must
speak
to
her
first
.
<EOS>
Help
me
up
,
Sam
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Gently
,
Sir
,
"
said
Sam
,
planting
his
head
against
the
wall
,
and
making
a
platform
of
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
Step
atop
o

that
'
ere
flower

pot

Sir
.
 
<EOS>
Now
then
,
up

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
I
shall
hurt
you
,
Sam

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never

me
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lend
him
a
hand
,
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Steady
,
sir
,
steady
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
time
o
'
day
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
Sam
spoke
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
by
exertions
almost
supernatural
in
a
gentleman
of
his
years
and
weight
,
contrived
to
get
upon
Sam
's
back
;
and
Sam
gently
raising
himself
up
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
holding
on
fast
by
the
top
of
the
wall
,
while
Mr
Winkle
clasped
him
tight
by
the
legs
,
they
contrived
by
these
means
to
bring
his
spectacles
just
above
the
level
of
the
coping
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
over
the
wall
,
and
catching
sight
of
Arabella
,
on
the
other
side
,
"
do
n't
be
frightened
,
my
dear
,
it
's
only
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
pray
go
away
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
said
Arabella
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
them
all
to
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
dreadfully
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
Mr
Pickwick
,
do
n't
stop
there
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
fall
down
and
kill
yourself
,
I
know
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
pray
do
n't
alarm
yourself
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
soothingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
not
the
least
cause
for
fear
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
Stand
firm
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
longer
than
you
can
conweniently
help
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
rayther
heavy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
another
moment
,
Sam
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
merely
wished
you
to
know
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
that
I
should
not
have
allowed
my
young
friend
to
see
you
in
this
clandestine
way
,
if
the
situation
in
which
you
are
placed
had
left
him
any
alternative
;
and
,
lest
the
impropriety
of
this
step
should
cause
you
any
uneasiness
,
my
love
,
it
may
be
a
satisfaction
to
you
,
to
know
that
I
am
present
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
kindness
and
consideration
,
"
replied
Arabella
,
drying
her
tears
with
her
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
probably
have
said
much
more
,
had
not
Mr
Pickwick
's
head
disappeared
with
great
swiftness
,
in
consequence
of
a
false
step
on
Sam
's
shoulder
which
brought
him
suddenly
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
up
again
in
an
instant
however
;
and
bidding
Mr
Winkle
make
haste
and
get
the
interview
over
,
ran
out
into
the
lane
to
keep
watch
,
with
all
the
courage
and
ardour
of
youth
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
himself
,
inspired
by
the
occasion
,
was
on
the
wall
in
a
moment
,
merely
pausing
to
request
Sam
to
be
careful
of
his
master
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
care
on
him
,
sir
,
"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
him
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
 
<EOS>
What
's
he
doing
,
Sam
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
his
old
gaiters
,
"
rejoined
Sam
,
looking
out
at
the
garden
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
-
keepin
'
guard
in
the
lane
vith
that
'
ere
dark
lantern
,
like
a
amiable
Guy
Fawkes
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
such
a
fine
creetur
in
my
days
.
 
<EOS>
Blessed
if
I
do
n't
think
his
heart
must
ha
'
been
born
five
-
and
-
twenty
year
arter
his
body
,
at
least
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
stayed
not
to
hear
the
encomium
upon
his
friend
.
<EOS>
He
had
dropped
from
the
wall
;
thrown
himself
at
Arabella
's
feet
;
and
by
this
time
was
pleading
the
sincerity
of
his
passion
with
an
eloquence
worthy
even
of
Mr
Pickwick
himself
.
   
<EOS>
While
these
things
were
going
on
in
the
open
air
,
an
elderly
gentleman
of
scientific
attainments
was
seated
in
his
library
,
two
or
three
houses
off
,
writing
a
philosophical
treatise
,
and
ever
and
anon
moistening
his
clay
and
his
labours
with
a
glass
of
claret
from
a
venerable
-
looking
bottle
which
stood
by
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
agonies
of
composition
,
the
elderly
gentleman
looked
sometimes
at
the
carpet
,
sometimes
at
the
ceiling
,
and
sometimes
at
the
wall
;
and
when
neither
carpet
,
ceiling
,
nor
wall
afforded
the
requisite
degree
of
inspiration
,
he
looked
out
of
the
window
.
   
<EOS>
In
one
of
these
pauses
of
invention
,
the
scientific
gentleman
was
gazing
abstractedly
on
the
thick
darkness
outside
,
when
he
was
very
much
surprised
by
observing
a
most
brilliant
light
glide
through
the
air
,
at
a
short
distance
above
the
ground
,
and
almost
instantaneously
vanish
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
short
time
the
phenomenon
was
repeated
,
not
once
or
twice
,
but
<EOS>
several
times
;
at
last
the
scientific
gentleman
,
laying
down
his
pen
,
began
to
consider
to
what
natural
causes
these
appearances
were
to
be
assigned
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
not
meteors
;
they
were
too
low
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
not
glow
-
worms
;
they
were
too
high
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
not
will
-
o'-the
-
wisps
;
they
were
not
fireflies
;
they
were
not
fireworks
.
 
<EOS>
What
could
they
be
?
 
<EOS>
Some
extraordinary
and
wonderful
phenomenon
of
nature
,
which
no
philosopher
had
ever
seen
before
;
<EOS>
something
which
it
had
been
reserved
for
him
alone
to
discover
,
and
which
he
should
immortalise
his
name
by
chronicling
for
the
benefit
of
posterity
.
 
<EOS>
Full
of
this
idea
,
the
scientific
gentleman
seized
his
pen
again
,
and
committed
to
paper
sundry
notes
of
these
unparalleled
appearances
,
with
the
date
,
day
,
hour
,
minute
,
and
precise
second
at
which
they
were
visible
:
all
of
which
were
to
form
the
data
of
a
voluminous
treatise
of
great
research
and
deep
learning
,
which
should
astonish
all
the
atmospherical
wiseacres
that
ever
drew
breath
in
any
part
of
the
civilised
globe
.
   
<EOS>
He
threw
himself
back
in
his
easy
-
chair
,
wrapped
in
contemplations
of
his
future
greatness
.
 
<EOS>
The
mysterious
light
appeared
more
brilliantly
than
before
,
dancing
,
to
all
appearance
,
up
and
down
the
lane
,
crossing
from
side
to
side
,
and
moving
in
an
orbit
as
eccentric
as
comets
themselves
.
   
<EOS>
The
scientific
gentleman
was
a
bachelor
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
wife
to
call
in
and
astonish
,
so
he
rang
the
bell
for
his
servant
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pruffle
,
"
said
the
scientific
gentleman
,
"
there
is
something
very
extraordinary
in
the
air
to
-
night
?
 
<EOS>
Did
you
see
that
?
"
said
the
scientific
gentleman
,
pointing
out
of
the
window
,
as
the
light
again
became
visible
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
did
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
it
,
Pruffle
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Think
of
it
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
been
bred
up
in
this
country
.
 
<EOS>
What
should
you
say
was
the
cause
for
those
lights
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
scientific
gentleman
smilingly
anticipated
Pruffle
's
reply
that
he
could
assign
no
cause
for
them
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Pruffle
meditated
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
it
was
thieves
,
Sir
,
"
said
Pruffle
at
length
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
fool
,
and
may
go
downstairs
,
"
said
the
scientific
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Sir
,
"
said
Pruffle
.
 
<EOS>
And
down
he
went
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
scientific
gentleman
could
not
rest
under
the
idea
of
the
ingenious
treatise
he
had
projected
being
lost
to
the
world
,
which
must
inevitably
be
the
case
if
the
speculation
of
the
ingenious
Mr
Pruffle
were
not
stifled
in
its
birth
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
on
his
hat
and
walked
quickly
down
the
garden
,
determined
to
investigate
the
matter
to
the
very
bottom
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
shortly
before
the
scientific
gentleman
walked
out
into
the
garden
,
Mr
Pickwick
had
run
down
the
lane
as
fast
as
he
could
,
to
convey
a
false
alarm
that
somebody
was
coming
that
way
;
occasionally
drawing
back
the
slide
of
the
dark
lantern
to
keep
himself
from
the
ditch
.
 
<EOS>
The
alarm
was
no
sooner
given
,
than
Mr
Winkle
scrambled
back
over
the
wall
,
and
Arabella
ran
into
the
house
;
the
garden
gate
was
shut
,
and
the
three
adventurers
were
making
the
best
of
their
way
down
the
lane
,
when
they
were
startled
by
the
scientific
gentleman
unlocking
his
garden
gate
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
hard
,
"
whispered
Sam
,
who
was
,
of
course
,
the
first
of
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
"
Show
a
light
for
just
vun
second
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
did
as
he
was
desired
,
and
Sam
,
seeing
a
man
's
head
peeping
out
very
cautiously
within
half
a
yard
of
his
own
,
gave
it
a
gentle
tap
with
his
clenched
fist
,
which
knocked
it
,
with
a
hollow
sound
,
against
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
Having
performed
this
feat
with
great
suddenness
and
dexterity
,
Mr
Weller
caught
Mr
Pickwick
up
on
his
back
,
and
followed
Mr
Winkle
down
the
lane
at
a
pace
which
,
considering
the
burden
he
carried
,
was
perfectly
astonishing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
got
your
vind
back
agin
,
Sir
,
"
inquired
Sam
,
when
they
had
reached
the
end
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
,
now
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
come
along
,
Sir
,
"
said
Sam
,
setting
his
master
on
his
feet
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
betveen
us
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Not
half
a
mile
to
run
.
 
<EOS>
Think
you
're
vinnin
'
a
cup
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Now
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
encouraged
,
Mr
Pickwick
made
the
very
best
use
of
his
legs
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
confidently
stated
that
a
pair
of
black
gaiters
never
got
over
the
ground
in
better
style
than
did
those
of
Mr
Pickwick
on
this
memorable
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
The
coach
was
waiting
,
the
horses
were
fresh
,
the
roads
were
good
,
and
the
driver
was
willing
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
party
arrived
in
safety
at
the
Bush
before
Mr
Pickwick
had
recovered
his
breath
.
   
<EOS>
"
in
with
you
at
once
,
sir
,
"
said
Sam
,
as
he
helped
his
master
out
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
stop
a
second
in
the
street
,
arter
that
'
ere
exercise
.
 
<EOS>
Beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
continued
Sam
,
touching
his
hat
as
Mr
Winkle
descended
,
"
hope
there
warn't
<EOS>
a
priory
"
tachment
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
grasped
his
humble
friend
by
the
hand
,
and
whispered
in
his
ear
,
"
It
's
all
right
,
Sam
;
quite
right
.
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
Mr
Weller
struck
three
distinct
blows
upon
his
nose
in
token
of
intelligence
,
smiled
,
winked
,
and
proceeded
to
put
the
steps
up
,
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
lively
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
the
scientific
gentleman
,
he
demonstrated
,
in
a
masterly
treatise
,
that
these
wonderful
lights
were
the
effect
of
electricity
;
and
clearly
proved
the
same
by
detailing
how
a
flash
of
fire
danced
before
his
eyes
when
he
put
his
head
out
of
the
gate
,
and
how
he
received
a
shock
which
stunned
him
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
;
which
demonstration
delighted
all
the
scientific
associations
beyond
measure
,
and
caused
him
to
be
considered
a
light
of
science
ever
afterwards
.

<EOS>
Introduces
Mr
Pickwick
to
a
new
and
not
uninteresting
scene
in
the
great
drama
of
life
 
<EOS>
The
remainder
of
the
period
which
Mr
Pickwick
had
assigned
as
the
duration
of
the
stay
at
Bath
passed
over
without
the
occurrence
of
anything
material
.
 
<EOS>
Trinity
term
commenced
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
expiration
of
its
first
week
,
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
friends
returned
to
London
;
and
the
former
gentleman
,
attended
of
course
by
Sam
,
straightway
repaired
to
his
old
quarters
at
the
George
and
Vulture
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
third
morning
after
their
arrival
,
just
as
all
the
clocks
in
the
city
were
striking
nine
individually
,
and
somewhere
about
nine
hundred
and
ninety
-
nine
collectively
,
Sam
was
taking
the
air
in
George
Yard
,
when
a
queer
sort
of
fresh
-
painted
vehicle
drove
up
,
out
of
which
there
jumped
with
great
agility
,
throwing
the
reins
to
a
stout
man
who
sat
beside
him
,
a
queer
sort
of
gentleman
,
who
seemed
made
for
the
vehicle
,
and
the
vehicle
for
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
vehicle
was
not
exactly
a
gig
,
neither
was
it
a
stanhope
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
what
is
currently
denominated
a
dog
-
cart
,
neither
was
it
a
taxed
cart
,
nor
a
chaise
-
cart
,
nor
a
guillotined
cabriolet
;
and
yet
it
had
something
of
the
character
of
each
and
every
of
these
machines
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
painted
a
bright
yellow
,
with
the
shafts
and
wheels
picked
out
in
black
;
and
the
driver
sat
in
the
orthodox
sporting
style
,
on
cushions
piled
about
two
feet
above
the
rail
.
<EOS>
The
horse
was
a
bay
,
a
well
-
looking
animal
enough
;
but
with
something
of
a
flash
and
dog
-
fighting
air
about
him
,
nevertheless
,
which
accorded
both
with
the
vehicle
and
his
master
.
   
<EOS>
The
master
himself
was
a
man
of
about
forty
,
with
black
hair
,
and
carefully
combed
whiskers
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
a
particularly
gorgeous
manner
,
with
plenty
of
articles
of
jewellery
about
him
---
all
about
three
sizes
larger
than
those
which
are
usually
worn
by
gentlemen
---
and
a
rough
greatcoat
to
crown
the
whole
.
 
<EOS>
Into
one
pocket
of
this
greatcoat
,
he
thrust
his
left
hand
the
moment
he
dismounted
,
while
from
the
other
he
drew
forth
,
with
his
right
,
a
very
bright
and
glaring
silk
handkerchief
,
with
which
he
whisked
a
speck
or
two
of
dust
from
his
boots
,
and
then
,
crumpling
it
in
his
hand
,
swaggered
up
the
court
.
   
<EOS>
It
had
not
escaped
Sam
's
attention
that
,
when
this
person
dismounted
,
a
shabby
-
looking
man
in
a
brown
greatcoat
shorn
of
divers
buttons
,
who
had
been
previously
slinking
about
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
,
crossed
over
,
and
remained
stationary
close
by
.
 
<EOS>
Having
something
more
than
a
suspicion
of
the
object
of
the
gentleman
's
visit
,
Sam
preceded
him
to
the
George
and
Vulture
,
and
,
turning
sharp
round
,
planted
himself
in
the
Centre
of
the
doorway
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
fine
fellow
!
"
said
the
man
in
the
rough
coat
,
in
an
imperious
tone
,
attempting
at
the
same
time
to
push
his
way
past
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Sir
,
wot
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
replied
Sam
,
returning
the
push
with
compound
interest
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
none
of
this
,
my
man
;
this
wo
n't
do
with
me
,
"
said
the
owner
of
the
rough
coat
,
raising
his
voice
,
and
turning
white
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
Smouch
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
wot
's
amiss
here
?
<EOS>
"
growled
the
man
in
the
brown
coat
,
who
had
been
gradually
sneaking
up
the
court
during
this
short
dialogue
.
   
<EOS>
"
Only
some
insolence
of
this
young
man
's
,
"
said
the
principal
,
giving
Sam
another
push
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
none
o
'
this
gammon
,
"
growled
Smouch
,
giving
him
another
,
and
a
harder
one
.
   
<EOS>
This
last
push
had
the
effect
which
it
was
intended
by
the
experienced
Mr
Smouch
to
produce
;
for
while
Sam
,
anxious
to
return
the
compliment
,
was
grinding
that
gentleman
's
body
against
the
door
-
post
,
the
principal
crept
past
,
and
made
his
way
to
the
bar
,
whither
Sam
,
after
bandying
a
few
epithetical
remarks
with
Mr
Smouch
,
followed
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
morning
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
principal
,
addressing
the
young
lady
at
the
bar
,
with
Botany
Bay
ease
,
and
New
South
Wales
gentility
;
"
which
is
Mr
Pickwick
's
room
,
my
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Show
him
up
,
"
said
the
barmaid
to
a
waiter
,
without
deigning
another
look
at
the
exquisite
,
in
reply
to
his
inquiry
.
   
<EOS>
The
waiter
led
the
way
upstairs
as
he
was
desired
,
and
the
man
in
the
rough
coat
followed
,
with
Sam
behind
him
,
who
,
in
his
progress
up
the
staircase
,
indulged
in
sundry
gestures
indicative
of
supreme
contempt
and
defiance
,
to
the
unspeakable
gratification
of
the
servants
and
other
lookers
-
on
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Smouch
,
who
was
troubled
with
a
hoarse
cough
,
remained
below
,
and
expectorated
in
the
passage
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
fast
asleep
in
bed
,
when
his
early
visitor
,
followed
by
Sam
,
entered
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
noise
they
made
,
in
so
doing
,
awoke
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shaving
-
water
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
from
within
the
curtains
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shave
you
directly
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
said
the
visitor
,
drawing
one
of
them
back
from
the
bed
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
an
execution
against
you

<EOS>
I
suppose
you
'll
come
over
to
my
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
Giving
Mr
Pickwick
a
friendly
tap
on
the
shoulder
,
the
sheriff
's
officer
(
for
such
he
was
)
threw
his
card
on
the
counterpane
,
and
pulled
a
gold
toothpick
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
"
Namby
's
the
name
,
"
said
the
sheriff
's
deputy
,
as
Mr
Pickwick
took
his
spectacles
from
under
the
pillow
,
and
put
them
on
,
to
read
the
card
.
 
<EOS>
"
Namby
,
Bell
Alley
,
Coleman
Street
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
point
,
Sam
Weller
,
who
had
had
his
eyes
fixed
hitherto
on
Mr
Namby
's
shining
beaver
,
interfered
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
a
Quaker
?
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
let
you
know
I
am
,
before
I
've
done
with
you
,
"
replied
the
indignant
officer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
teach
you
manners
,
my
fine
fellow
,
one
of
these
fine
mornings
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
do
the
same
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Take
your
hat
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
Mr
Weller
,
in
the
most
dexterous
manner
,
knocked
Mr
Namby
's
hat
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
,
with
such
violence
,
that
he
had
very
nearly
caused
him
to
swallow
the
gold
toothpick
into
the
bargain
.
   
<EOS>
"
Observe
this
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
said
the
disconcerted
officer
,
gasping
for
breath
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
assaulted
in
the
execution
of
my
dooty
by
your
servant
in
your
chamber

<EOS>
I
'm
in
bodily

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
witness
nothin'
,
Sir
,
"
interposed
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shut
your
eyes
up
tight
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
pitch
him
out
o

winder
,
only
he
could
n't
fall
far
enough
,
"
cause
o

the
leads
outside
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
in
an
angry
voice
,
as
his
attendant
made
various
demonstrations
of
hostilities
,
"
if
you
say
another
word
,
or
offer
the
slightest
interference
with
this
person
,
I
discharge
you
that
instant

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
Sir
!
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
"
interposed
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
that
hat
up
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
this
Sam
flatly
and
positively
refused
to
do
;
and
,
after
he
had
been
severely
reprimanded
by
his
master
,
the
officer
,
being
in
a
hurry
,
condescended
to
pick
it
up
himself
,
venting
a
great
variety
of
threats
against
Sam
meanwhile
,
which
that
gentleman
received
with
perfect
composure
,
merely
observing
that
if
Mr
Namby
would
have
the
goodness
to
put
his
hat
on
again
,
he
would
knock
it
into
the
latter
end
of
next
week
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Namby
,
perhaps
thinking
that
such
a
process
might
be
productive
of
inconvenience
to
himself
,
declined
to
offer
the
temptation
,
and
,
soon
after
,
called
up
Smouch
.
 
<EOS>
Having
informed
him
that
the
capture
was
made
,
and
that
he
was
to
wait
for
the
prisoner
until
he
should
have
finished
dressing
,
Namby
then
swaggered
out
,
and
drove
away
.
 
<EOS>
Smouch
,
requesting
Mr
Pickwick
in
a
surly
manner
"
to
be
as
alive
as
he
could
<EOS>
,
for
it
was
a
busy
time
,
"
drew
up
a
chair
by
the
door
and
sat
there
,
until
he
had
finished
dressing
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
was
then
despatched
for
a
hackney
-
coach
,
and
in
it
the
triumvirate
proceeded
to
Coleman
Street
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
fortunate
the
distance
was
short
;
for
Mr
Smouch
,
besides
possessing
no
very
enchanting
conversational
powers
,
was
rendered
a
decidedly
unpleasant
companion
in
a
limited
space
,
by
the
physical
weakness
to
which
we
have
elsewhere
adverted
.
   
<EOS>
The
coach
having
turned
into
a
very
narrow
and
dark
street
,
stopped
before
a
house
with
iron
bars
to
all
the
windows
;
the
door
-
posts
of
which
were
graced
by
the
name
and
title
of
"
Namby
,
Officer
to
the
Sheriffs
of
London
"
;
the
inner
gate
having
been
opened
by
a
gentleman
who
might
have
passed
for
a
neglected
twin
-
brother
of
Mr
Smouch
,
and
who
was
endowed
with
a
large
key
for
the
purpose
,
Mr
Pickwick
was
shown
into
the
"
coffee
-
room
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
coffee
-
room
was
a
front
parlour
,
the
principal
features
of
which
were
fresh
sand
and
stale
tobacco
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
bowed
to
the
three
persons
who
were
seated
in
it
when
he
entered
;
and
having
despatched
Sam
for
Perker
,
withdrew
into
an
obscure
corner
,
and
looked
thence
with
some
curiosity
upon
his
new
companions
.
   
<EOS>
One
of
these
was
a
mere
boy
of
nineteen
or
twenty
,
who
,
though
it
was
yet
barely
ten
o'clock
,
was
drinking
gin
-
and
-
water
,
and
smoking
a
cigar
---
amusements
to
which
,
judging
from
his
inflamed
countenance
,
he
had
devoted
himself
pretty
constantly
for
the
last
year
or
two
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
Opposite
him
,
engaged
in
stirring
the
fire
with
the
toe
of
his
right
boot
,
was
a
coarse
,
vulgar
young
man
of
about
thirty
,
with
a
sallow
face
and
harsh
voice
;
evidently
possessed
of
that
knowledge
of
the
world
,
and
captivating
freedom
of
manner
,
which
is
to
be
acquired
in
public
-
house
parlours
,
and
at
low
billiard
tables
.
 
<EOS>
The
third
tenant
of
the
apartment
was
a
middle
-
aged
man
in
a
very
old
suit
of
black
,
who
looked
pale
and
haggard
,
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
incessantly
;
stopping
,
now
and
then
,
to
look
with
great
anxiety
out
of
the
window
as
if
he
expected
somebody
,
and
then
resuming
his
walk
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
have
the
loan
of
my
razor
this
morning
,
Mr
Ayresleigh
,
"
said
the
man
who
was
stirring
the
fire
,
tipping
the
wink
to
his
friend
the
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
no
,
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
want
it
;
I
expect
I
shall
be
out
,
in
the
course
of
an
hour
or
so
,
"
replied
the
other
in
a
hurried
manner
.
<EOS>
Then
,
walking
again
up
to
the
window
,
and
once
more
returning
disappointed
,
he
sighed
deeply
,
and
left
the
room
;
upon
which
the
other
two
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
never
saw
such
a
game
as
that
,
"
said
the
gentleman
who
had
offered
the
razor
,
whose
name
appeared
to
be
Price
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Never
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Price
confirmed
the
assertion
with
an
oath
,
and
then
laughed
again
,
when
of
course
the
boy
(
who
thought
his
companion
one
of
the
most
dashing
fellows
alive
)
laughed
also
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'd
hardly
think
,
would
you
now
,
"
said
Price
,
<EOS>
turning
towards
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
that
that
chap
's
been
here
a
week
yesterday
,
and
never
once
shaved
himself
yet
,
because
he
feels
so
certain
he
's
going
out
in
half
an
hour
's
time
,
thinks
he
may
as
well
put
it
off
till
he
gets
home
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
man
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
his
chances
of
getting
out
of
his
difficulties
really
so
great
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Chances
be
d####d
,
"
replied
Price
;
"
he
has
n't
half
the
ghost
of
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
give
THAT
for
his
chance
of
walking
about
the
streets
this
time
ten
years
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
Mr
Price
snapped
his
fingers
contemptuously
,
and
rang
the
bell
.
   
<EOS>
"
Give
me
a
sheet
of
paper
,
Crookey
,
"
said
Mr
Price
to
the
attendant
,
who
in
dress
and
general
appearance
looked
something
between
a
bankrupt
glazier
,
and
a
drover
in
a
state
of
insolvency
;
"
and
a
glass
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
Crookey
,
d'ye
hear
?
 
<EOS>
I
'm
going
to
write
to
my
father
,
and
I
must
have
a
stimulant
,
or
I
sha
n't
be
able
to
pitch
it
strong
enough
into
the
old
boy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
facetious
speech
,
the
young
boy
,
it
is
almost
needless
to
say
,
was
fairly
convulsed
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
"
said
Mr
Price
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
say
die
.
 
<EOS>
All
fun
,
ai
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Prime
!
"
said
the
young
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
've
got
some
spirit
about
you
,
you
have
,
"
said
Price
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
seen
something
of
life
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
rather
think
I
have
!
"
replied
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
looked
at
it
through
the
dirty
panes
of
glass
in
a
bar
door
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
feeling
not
a
little
disgusted
with
this
dialogue
,
as
well
as
with
the
air
and
manner
of
the
two
beings
by
whom
it
had
been
carried
on
,
was
about
to
inquire
whether
he
could
not
be
accommodated
with
a
private
sitting
-
room
,
when
two
or
three
strangers
of
genteel
appearance
entered
,
at
sight
of
whom
the
boy
threw
his
cigar
into
the
fire
,
and
whispering
to
Mr
Price
that
they
had
come
to
"
make
it
all
right
"
for
him
,
joined
them
at
a
table
in
the
farther
end
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
appear
,
however
,
that
matters
were
not
going
to
be
made
all
right
quite
so
speedily
as
the
young
gentleman
anticipated
;
for
a
very
long
conversation
ensued
,
of
which
Mr
Pickwick
could
not
avoid
hearing
certain
angry
fragments
regarding
dissolute
conduct
,
and
repeated
forgiveness
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
there
were
very
distinct
allusions
made
by
the
oldest
gentleman
of
the
party
to
one
Whitecross
Street
,
at
which
the
young
gentleman
,
notwithstanding
his
primeness
and
his
spirit
,
and
his
knowledge
of
life
into
the
bargain
,
reclined
his
head
upon
the
table
,
and
howled
dismally
.
   
<EOS>
Very
much
satisfied
with
this
sudden
bringing
down
of
the
youth
's
valour
,
and
this
effectual
lowering
of
his
tone
,
Mr
Pickwick
rang
the
bell
,
and
was
shown
,
at
his
own
request
,
into
a
private
room
furnished
with
a
carpet
,
table
,
chairs
,
sideboard
and
sofa
,
and
ornamented
with
a
looking
-
glass
,
and
various
old
prints
.
 
<EOS>
Here
he
had
the
advantage
of
hearing
Mrs
Namby
's
performance
on
a
square
piano
overhead
,
while
the
breakfast
was
getting
ready
;
when
it
came
,
Mr
Perker
came
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aha
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
said
the
little
man
,
"
nailed
at
last
,
eh
?
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
I
'm
not
sorry
for
it
either
,
because
now
you
'll
see
the
absurdity
of
this
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
noted
down
the
amount
of
the
taxed
costs
and
damages
for
which
the
ca
-
sa
was
issued
,
and
we
had
better
settle
at
once
and
lose
no
time
.
 
<EOS>
Namby
is
come
home
by
this
time
,
I
dare
say
.
 
<EOS>
What
say
you
,
my
dear
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
draw
a
cheque
,
or
will
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
little
man
rubbed
his
hands
with
affected
cheerfulness
as
he
said
this
,
but
glancing
at
Mr
Pickwick
's
countenance
,
could
not
forbear
at
the
same
time
casting
a
desponding
look
towards
Sam
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perker
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
let
me
hear
no
more
of
this
,
I
beg
.
<EOS>
I
see
no
advantage
in
staying
here
,
so
I
Shall
go
to
prison
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
go
to
Whitecross
Street
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
said
Perker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Impossible
!
 
<EOS>
There
are
sixty
beds
in
a
ward
;
and
the
bolt
's
on
,
sixteen
hours
out
of
the
four
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
go
to
some
other
place
of
confinement
if
I
can
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
not
,
I
must
make
the
best
I
can
of
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
go
to
the
Fleet
,
my
dear
Sir
,
if
you
're
determined
to
go
somewhere
,
"
said
Perker
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
'll
do
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
there
directly
<EOS>
I
have
finished
my
breakfast
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
,
stop
,
my
dear
Sir
;
not
the
least
occasion
for
being
in
such
a
violent
hurry
to
get
into
a
place
that
most
other
men
are
as
eager
to
get
out
of
,
"
said
the
good
-
natured
little
attorney
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
have
a
habeas
-
corpus
.
 
<EOS>
There
'll
be
no
judge
at
chambers
till
four
o'clock
this
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
wait
till
then
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
unmoved
patience
.
<EOS>
"
Then
we
will
have
a
chop
here
,
at
two
.
 
<EOS>
See
about
it
,
Sam
,
and
tell
them
to
be
punctual
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
remaining
firm
,
despite
all
the
remonstrances
and
arguments
of
Perker
,
the
chops
appeared
and
disappeared
in
due
course
;
he
was
then
put
into
another
hackney
coach
,
and
carried
off
to
Chancery
Lane
,
after
waiting
half
an
hour
or
so
for
Mr
Namby
,
who
had
a
select
dinner
-
party
and
could
on
no
account
be
disturbed
before
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
two
judges
in
attendance
at
Serjeant
's
Inn
---
one
King
's
Bench
,
and
one
Common
Pleas
---
and
a
great
deal
of
business
appeared
to
be
transacting
before
them
,
if
the
number
of
lawyer
's
clerks
who
were
hurrying
in
and
out
with
bundles
of
papers
,
afforded
any
test
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
reached
the
low
archway
which
forms
the
entrance
to
the
inn
,
Perker
was
detained
a
few
moments
parlaying
with
the
coachman
about
the
fare
and
the
change
;
and
Mr
Pickwick
,
stepping
to
one
side
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
the
stream
of
people
that
were
pouring
in
and
out
,
looked
about
him
with
some
curiosity
.
   
<EOS>
The
people
that
attracted
his
attention
most
,
were
three
or
four
men
of
shabby
-
genteel
appearance
,
who
touched
their
hats
to
many
of
the
attorneys
who
passed
,
and
seemed
to
have
some
business
there
,
the
nature
of
which
Mr
Pickwick
could
not
divine
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
curious
-
looking
fellows
.
 
<EOS>
One
was
a
slim
and
rather
lame
man
in
rusty
black
,
and
a
white
neckerchief
;
another
was
a
stout
,
burly
person
,
dressed
in
the
same
apparel
,
with
a
great
reddish
-
black
cloth
round
his
neck
;
a
third
was
a
little
weazen
,
drunken
-
looking
body
,
with
a
pimply
face
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
loitering
about
,
with
their
hands
behind
them
,
and
now
and
then
with
an
anxious
countenance
whispered
something
in
the
ear
of
some
of
the
gentlemen
with
papers
,
as
they
hurried
by
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
remembered
to
have
very
often
observed
them
lounging
under
the
archway
when
he
had
been
walking
past
;
and
his
curiosity
was
quite
excited
to
know
to
what
branch
of
the
profession
these
dingy
-
looking
loungers
could
possibly
belong
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
about
to
propound
the
question
to
Namby
,
who
kept
close
beside
him
,
sucking
a
large
gold
ring
on
his
little
finger
,
when
Perker
bustled
up
,
and
observing
that
there
was
no
time
to
lose
,
led
the
way
into
the
inn
.
 
<EOS>
As
Mr
Pickwick
followed
,
the
lame
man
stepped
up
to
him
,
and
civilly
touching
his
hat
,
held
out
a
written
card
,
which
Mr
Pickwick
,
not
wishing
to
hurt
the
man
's
feelings
by
refusing
,
courteously
accepted
and
deposited
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Perker
,
turning
round
before
he
entered
one
of
the
offices
,
to
see
that
his
companions
were
close
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
here
,
my
dear
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Hallo
,
what
do
you
want
?
"
   
<EOS>
This
last
question
was
addressed
to
the
lame
man
,
who
,
unobserved
by
Mr
Pickwick
,
made
one
of
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
In
reply
to
it
,
the
lame
man
touched
his
hat
again
,
with
all
imaginable
politeness
,
and
motioned
towards
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Perker
,
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't
want
you
,
my
dear
friend
,
we
do
n't
want
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
said
the
lame
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
took
my
card
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
employ
me
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
nodded
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
be
judged
by
the
gentleman
himself
.
 
<EOS>
You
nodded
to
me
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pooh
,
pooh
,
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
You
did
n't
nod
to
anybody
,
Pickwick
?
<EOS>
A
mistake
,
a
mistake
,
"
said
Perker
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
gentleman
handed
me
his
card
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
producing
it
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
accepted
it
,
as
the
gentleman
seemed
to
wish
it

in
fact
I
had
some
curiosity
to
look
at
it
when
I
should
be
at
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
   
The
little
attorney
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
,
and
returning
the
card
to
the
lame
man
,
informing
him
it
was
all
a
mistake
,
<EOS>
whispered
to
Mr
Pickwick
as
the
man
turned
away
in
dudgeon
,
that
he
was
only
a
bail
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
what
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
bail
,
"
replied
Perker
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
bail
!
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
sir
---
half
a
dozen
of
'em
here
.
 
Bail
you
to
any
amount
,
and
only
charge
half
a
crown
.
 
<EOS>
Curious
trade
,
is
n't
it
?
"
said
Perker
,
regaling
himself
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
Am
I
to
understand
that
these
men
earn
a
livelihood
by
waiting
about
here
,
to
perjure
themselves
before
the
judges
of
the
land
,
at
the
rate
of
half
a
crown
a
crime
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
,
quite
aghast
at
the
disclosure
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
do
n't
exactly
know
about
perjury
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
replied
the
little
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Harsh
word
,
my
dear
sir
,
very
harsh
word
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
legal
fiction
,
my
dear
sir
,
nothing
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
Saying
which
,
the
attorney
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
smiled
,
took
a
second
pinch
of
snuff
,
and
led
the
way
into
the
office
of
the
judge
's
clerk
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
a
room
of
specially
dirty
appearance
,
with
a
very
low
ceiling
and
old
panelled
walls
;
and
so
badly
lighted
,
that
although
it
was
broad
day
outside
,
great
tallow
candles
were
burning
on
the
desks
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
end
,
was
a
door
leading
to
the
judge
's
private
apartment
,
round
which
were
congregated
a
crowd
of
attorneys
and
managing
clerks
,
who
were
called
in
,
in
the
order
in
which
their
respective
appointments
stood
upon
the
file
.
 
<EOS>
Every
time
this
door
was
opened
to
let
a
party
out
,
the
next
party
made
a
violent
rush
to
get
in
;
and
,
as
in
addition
to
the
numerous
dialogues
which
passed
between
the
gentlemen
who
were
waiting
to
see
the
judge
,
a
variety
of
personal
squabbles
ensued
between
the
greater
part
of
those
who
had
seen
him
,
there
was
as
much
noise
as
could
well
be
raised
in
an
apartment
of
such
confined
dimensions
.
   
<EOS>
Nor
were
the
conversations
of
these
gentlemen
<EOS>
the
only
sounds
that
broke
upon
the
ear
.
 
<EOS>
Standing
on
a
box
behind
a
wooden
bar
at
another
end
of
the
room
was
a
clerk
in
spectacles
who
was
"
taking
the
affidavits
"
;
large
batches
of
which
were
,
from
time
to
time
,
carried
into
the
private
room
by
another
clerk
for
the
judge
's
signature
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
a
large
number
of
attorneys
"
clerks
to
be
sworn
,
and
it
being
a
moral
impossibility
to
swear
them
all
at
once
,
the
struggles
of
these
gentlemen
to
reach
the
clerk
in
spectacles
,
were
like
those
of
a
crowd
to
get
in
at
the
pit
door
of
a
theatre
when
Gracious
Majesty
honours
it
with
its
presence
.
<EOS>
Another
functionary
,
from
time
to
time
,
exercised
his
lungs
in
calling
over
the
names
of
those
who
had
been
sworn
,
for
the
purpose
of
restoring
to
them
their
affidavits
after
they
had
been
signed
by
the
judge
,
which
gave
rise
to
a
few
more
scuffles
;
and
all
these
things
going
on
at
the
same
time
,
occasioned
as
much
bustle
as
the
most
active
and
excitable
person
could
desire
to
behold
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
yet
another
class
of
persons
---
those
who
were
waiting
to
attend
summonses
their
employers
had
taken
out
,
which
it
was
optional
to
the
attorney
on
the
opposite
side
to
attend
or
not
---
and
whose
business
it
was
,
from
time
to
time
,
to
cry
out
the
opposite
attorney
's
name
;
to
make
certain
that
he
was
not
in
attendance
without
their
knowledge
.
   
<EOS>
For
example
.
 
<EOS>
Leaning
against
the
wall
,
close
beside
the
seat
Mr
Pickwick
had
taken
,
was
an
office
-
lad
of
fourteen
,
with
a
tenor
voice
;
near
him
a
common
-
law
clerk
with
a
bass
one
.
   
<EOS>
A
clerk
hurried
in
with
a
bundle
of
papers
,
and
stared
about
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sniggle
and
Blink
,
"
cried
the
tenor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Porkin
and
Snob
,
"
growled
the
bass
.
<EOS>
"
Stumpy
and
Deacon
,
"
said
the
new
-
comer
.
   
<EOS>
Nobody
answered
;
the
next
man
who
came
in
,
was
bailed
by
the
whole
three
;
and
he
in
his
turn
shouted
for
another
firm
;
and
then
somebody
else
roared
in
a
loud
voice
for
another
;
and
so
forth
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
the
man
in
the
spectacles
was
hard
at
work
,
swearing
the
clerks
;
the
oath
being
invariably
administered
,
without
any
effort
at
punctuation
,
and
usually
in
the
following
terms
<EOS>
:
---
   
"
Take
the
book
in
your
right
hand
this
is
your
name
and
hand
-
writing
<EOS>
you
swear
that
the
contents
of
this
your
affidavit
are
true
<EOS>
so
help
you
God
a
shilling
<EOS>
you
must
get
change
<EOS>
I
have
n't
got
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
I
suppose
they
are
getting
the
HABEAS
-
CORPUS
ready
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
vish
<EOS>
they
'd
bring
out

carcase

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
I

got
half
a
dozen
have

his
-
carcases
ready
,
<EOS>
pack'd
up
and
all
,
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
What
sort
of
cumbrous
and
unmanageable
machine
,
Sam
Weller
imagined
a
habeas
-
corpus
to
be
,
does
not
appear
;
for
Perker
,
at
that
moment
,
walked
up
and
took
Mr
Pickwick
away
.
   
<EOS>
The
usual
forms
having
been
gone
through
,
the
body
of
Samuel
Pickwick
was
soon
afterwards
confided
to
the
custody
of
the
tipstaff
,
to
be
by
him
taken
to
the
warden
of
the
Fleet
Prison
,
and
there
detained
until
the
amount
of
the
damages
and
costs
in
the
action
of
Bardell
against
Pickwick
was
fully
paid
and
satisfied
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
laughing
,
"
will
be
a
very
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
,
call
another
hackney
-
coach
.
 
<EOS>
Perker
,
my
dear
friend
,
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
go
with
you
,
and
see
you
safe
there
,
"
said
Perker
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
I
would
rather
go
without
any
other
attendant
than
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
get
settled
,
I
will
write
and
let
you
know
,
and
I
shall
expect
you
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
Until
then
,
good
-
bye
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Pickwick
said
this
,
he
got
into
the
coach
which
had
by
this
time
arrived
,
followed
by
the
tipstaff
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
having
stationed
himself
on
the
box
,
it
rolled
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
most
extraordinary
man
that
!
<EOS>
"
said
Perker
,
as
he
stopped
to
pull
on
his
gloves
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
bankrupt
he
'd
make
,
Sir
,
"
observed
Mr
Lowten
,
who
was
standing
near
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
he
would
bother
the
commissioners
!
<EOS>
He
'd
set
'em
at
defiance
if
they
talked
of
committing
him
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
attorney
did
not
appear
very
much
delighted
with
his
clerk
's
professional
estimate
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
character
,
for
he
walked
away
without
deigning
any
reply
.
   
<EOS>
The
hackney
-
coach
jolted
along
Fleet
Street
,
as
hackney
-
coaches
usually
do
.
 
<EOS>
The
horses
"
went
better
"
,
the
driver
said
,
when
they
had
anything
before
them
(
they
must
have
gone
at
a
most
extraordinary
pace
when
there
was
nothing
)
,
and
so
the
vehicle
kept
behind
a
cart
;
when
the
cart
stopped
,
it
stopped
;
and
when
the
cart
went
on
again
,
it
did
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
sat
opposite
the
tipstaff
;
and
the
tipstaff
sat
with
his
hat
between
his
knees
,
whistling
a
tune
,
and
looking
out
of
the
coach
window
.
   
<EOS>
Time
performs
wonders
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
powerful
old
gentleman
's
aid
,
even
a
hackney
-
coach
gets
over
half
a
mile
of
ground
.
 
<EOS>
They
stopped
at
length
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
alighted
at
the
gate
of
the
Fleet
.
   
<EOS>
The
tipstaff
,
just
looking
over
his
shoulder
to
see
that
his
charge
was
following
close
at
his
heels
,
preceded
Mr
Pickwick
into
the
prison
;
turning
to
the
left
,
<EOS>
after
they
had
entered
,
they
passed
through
an
open
door
into
a
lobby
,
from
which
a
heavy
gate
,
opposite
to
that
by
which
they
had
entered
,
and
which
was
guarded
by
a
stout
turnkey
with
the
key
in
his
hand
,
led
at
once
into
the
interior
of
the
prison
.
   
<EOS>
Here
they
stopped
,
while
the
tipstaff
delivered
his
papers
;
and
here
Mr
Pickwick
was
apprised
that
he
would
remain
,
until
he
had
undergone
the
ceremony
,
known
to
the
initiated
as
"
sitting
for
your
portrait
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sitting
for
my
portrait
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Having
your
likeness
taken
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
stout
turnkey
.
<EOS>
"
We
're
capital
hands
at
likenesses
here
.
 
<EOS>
Take
'em
in
no
time
,
and
always
exact
.
 
<EOS>
Walk
in
,
sir
,
and
make
yourself
at
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
complied
with
the
invitation
,
and
sat
himself
down
;
when
Mr
Weller
,
who
stationed
himself
at
the
back
of
the
chair
,
whispered
that
the
sitting
was
merely
another
term
for
undergoing
an
inspection
by
the
different
turnkeys
,
in
order
that
they
might
know
prisoners
from
visitors
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
then
I
wish
the
artists
would
come
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
rather
a
public
place
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
von't
be
long
,
Sir
,
I
des
-
say
,
"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
Dutch
clock
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
I
see
,
"
observed
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
a
bird
-
cage
,
sir
,
"
says
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Veels
vithin
veels
,
a
prison
in
a
prison
.
 
<EOS>
Ai
n't
it
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Weller
made
this
philosophical
remark
,
Mr
Pickwick
was
aware
that
his
sitting
had
commenced
.
 
<EOS>
The
stout
turnkey
having
been
relieved
from
the
lock
,
sat
down
,
and
looked
at
him
carelessly
,
from
time
to
time
,
while
a
long
thin
man
who
had
relieved
him
,
thrust
his
hands
beneath
his
coat
tails
,
and
planting
himself
opposite
,
took
a
good
long
view
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
A
third
rather
surly
-
looking
gentleman
,
who
had
apparently
been
disturbed
at
his
tea
,
for
he
was
disposing
of
the
last
remnant
of
a
crust
and
butter
when
he
came
in
,
stationed
himself
close
to
Mr
Pickwick
;
and
,
resting
his
hands
on
his
hips
,
inspected
him
narrowly
;
while
two
others
mixed
with
the
group
,
and
studied
his
features
with
most
intent
and
thoughtful
faces
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
winced
a
good
deal
under
the
operation
,
and
appeared
to
sit
very
uneasily
in
his
chair
;
but
he
made
no
remark
to
anybody
while
it
was
being
performed
,
not
even
to
Sam
,
who
reclined
upon
the
back
of
the
chair
,
reflecting
,
partly
on
the
situation
of
his
master
,
and
partly
on
the
great
satisfaction
it
would
have
afforded
him
to
make
a
fierce
assault
upon
all
the
turnkeys
there
assembled
,
one
after
the
other
,
if
it
were
lawful
and
peaceable
so
to
do
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
the
likeness
was
completed
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
was
informed
that
he
might
now
proceed
into
the
prison
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
am
I
to
sleep
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
do
n't
rightly
know
about
to
-
night
,
"
replied
the
stout
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
chummed
on
somebody
to
-
morrow
,
and
then
you
'll
be
all
snug
and
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
night
's
generally
rather
unsettled
,
but
you
'll
be
set
all
squares
to
-
morrow
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
some
discussion
,
it
was
discovered
that
one
of
the
turnkeys
had
a
bed
to
let
,
which
Mr
Pickwick
could
have
for
that
night
.
<EOS>
He
gladly
agreed
to
hire
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
come
with
me
,
I
'll
show
it
you
at
once
,
"
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
a
large

un

but
it
's
an
out
-
and
-
outer
to
sleep
in
.
 
<EOS>
This
way
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
They
passed
through
the
inner
gate
,
and
descended
a
short
flight
of
steps
.
 
<EOS>
The
key
was
turned
after
them
;
and
Mr
Pickwick
found
himself
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
within
the
walls
of
a
debtors
"
prison
.

<EOS>
What
befell
Mr
Pickwick
when
he
got
into
the
fleet
;
what
prisoners
he
saw
there
,
and
how
he
passed
the
night
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tom
Roker
,
the
gentleman
who
had
accompanied
Mr
Pickwick
into
the
prison
,
turned
sharp
round
to
the
right
when
he
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
little
flight
of
steps
,
and
led
the
way
,
through
an
iron
gate
which
stood
open
,
and
up
another
short
flight
of
steps
,
into
a
long
narrow
gallery
,
dirty
and
low
,
paved
with
stone
,
and
very
dimly
lighted
by
a
window
at
each
remote
end
.
   
<EOS>
"
This

said
the
gentleman
,
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
and
looking
carelessly
over
his
shoulder
to
Mr
Pickwick
---
"
this
here
is
the
hall
flight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
down
a
dark
and
filthy
staircase
,
which
appeared
to
lead
to
a
range
of
damp
and
gloomy
stone
vaults
,
beneath
the
ground
,
"
and
those
,
I
suppose
,
are
the
little
cellars
where
the
prisoners
keep
their
small
quantities
of
coals
.
 
<EOS>
Unpleasant
places
to
have
to
go
down
to
;
but
very
convenient
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
should
n't
wonder
if
they
was
convenient
,
"
replied
the
gentleman
,
"
seeing
that
a
few
people
live
there
,
pretty
snug
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
Fair
,
that
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
friend
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
you
do
n't
really
mean
to
say
that
human
beings
live
down
in
those
wretched
dungeons
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
I
?
"
replied
Mr
Roker
,
with
indignant
astonishment
;
"
<EOS>
why
should
n't
I
?
"
   
"
Live
!
<EOS>
---
live
down
there
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Live
down
there
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
die
down
there
,
too
,
very
often
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Mr
Roker
;
"
and
what
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
Who
's
got
to
say
anything
agin
it
?
 
<EOS>
Live
down
there
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
a
wery
good
place
it
is
to
live
in
,
ai
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
Roker
turned
somewhat
fiercely
upon
Mr
Pickwick
in
saying
this
,
and
moreover
muttered
in
an
excited
fashion
certain
unpleasant
invocations
concerning
his
own
eyes
,
limbs
,
and
circulating
fluids
,
the
latter
gentleman
deemed
it
advisable
to
pursue
the
discourse
no
further
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Roker
then
proceeded
to
mount
another
staircase
,
as
dirty
as
that
which
led
to
the
place
which
has
just
been
the
subject
of
discussion
,
in
which
ascent
he
was
closely
followed
by
Mr
Pickwick
and
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
said
Mr
Roker
,
pausing
for
breath
when
they
reached
another
gallery
of
the
same
dimensions
as
the
one
below
,
"
this
is
the
coffee
-
room
flight
;
the
one
above
's
the
third
,
and
the
one
above
that
's
the
top
;
and
the
room
where
you
're
a
-
going
to
sleep
to
-
night
is
the
warden
's
room
,
and
it
's
this
way
---
come
on
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Having
said
all
this
in
a
breath
,
Mr
Roker
mounted
another
flight
of
stairs
with
Mr
Pickwick
and
Sam
Weller
following
at
his
heels
.
   
<EOS>
These
staircases
received
light
from
sundry
windows
placed
at
some
little
distance
above
the
floor
,
and
looking
into
a
gravelled
area
bounded
by
a
high
brick
wall
,
with
iron
CHEVAUX
-
DE
-
FRISE
at
the
top
.
 
<EOS>
This
area
,
it
appeared
from
Mr
Roker
's
statement
,
was
the
racket
-
ground
;
and
it
further
appeared
,
on
the
testimony
of
the
same
gentleman
,
that
there
was
a
smaller
area
in
that
portion
of
the
prison
which
was
nearest
Farringdon
Street
,
denominated
and
called
"
the
Painted
Ground
,
"
from
the
fact
of
its
walls
having
once
displayed
the
semblance
of
various
men
-
of
-
war
in
full
sail
,
and
other
artistical
effects
achieved
in
bygone
times
by
some
imprisoned
draughtsman
in
his
leisure
hours
.
   
<EOS>
Having
communicated
this
piece
of
information
,
apparently
more
for
the
purpose
of
discharging
his
bosom
of
an
important
fact
,
than
with
any
specific
view
of
enlightening
Mr
Pickwick
,
the
guide
,
having
at
length
reached
another
gallery
,
led
the
way
into
a
small
passage
at
the
extreme
end
,
opened
a
door
,
and
disclosed
an
apartment
of
an
appearance
by
no
means
inviting
,
containing
eight
or
nine
iron
bedsteads
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
said
Mr
Roker
,
holding
the
door
open
,
and
looking
triumphantly
round
at
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
there
's
a
room
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
face
,
however
,
betokened
such
a
very
trifling
portion
of
satisfaction
at
the
appearance
of
his
lodging
,
that
Mr
Roker
looked
,
for
a
reciprocity
of
feeling
,
into
the
countenance
of
Samuel
Weller
,
who
,
until
now
,
had
observed
a
dignified
silence
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
room
,
young
man
,
"
observed
Mr
Roker
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
,
"
replied
Sam
,
with
a
placid
nod
of
the
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
think
to
find
such
a
room
as
this
in
the
Farringdon
Hotel
,
would
you
?
"
said
Mr
Roker
,
with
a
complacent
smile
.
   
<EOS>
To
this
Mr
Weller
replied
with
an
easy
and
unstudied
closing
of
one
eye
;
which
might
be
considered
to
mean
,
either
that
he
would
have
thought
it
,
or
that
he
would
not
have
thought
it
,
or
that
he
had
never
thought
anything
at
all
about
it
,
as
the
observer
's
imagination
suggested
.
 
<EOS>
Having
executed
this
feat
,
and
reopened
his
eye
,
Mr
Weller
proceeded
to
inquire
which
was
the
individual
bedstead
that
Mr
Roker
had
so
flatteringly
described
as
an
out
-
and
-
outer
to
sleep
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
,
"
replied
Mr
Roker
,
pointing
to
a
very
rusty
one
in
a
corner
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
make
any
one
go
to
sleep
,
that
bedstead
would
,
whether
they
wanted
to
or
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
,
"
said
Sam
,
eyeing
the
piece
of
furniture
in
question
with
a
look
of
excessive
disgust
<EOS>
---
"
I
should
think
poppies
was
nothing
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
at
all
,
"
said
Mr
Roker
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
s'pose
,
"
said
Sam
,
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
his
master
,
as
if
to
see
whether
there
were
any
symptoms
of
his
determination
being
shaken
by
what
passed
,
"
I
s'pose
<EOS>
the
other
gen'l'men
<EOS>
as
sleeps
here
ARE
gen'l'men
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
but
it
,
"
said
Mr
Roker
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
of
'em
takes
his
twelve
pints
of
ale
a
day
,
and
never
leaves
off
smoking
even
at
his
meals
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
a
first
-
rater
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
A1
,
"
replied
Mr
Roker
.
   
<EOS>
Nothing
daunted
,
even
by
this
intelligence
,
Mr
Pickwick
smilingly
announced
his
determination
to
test
the
powers
of
the
narcotic
bedstead
for
that
night
;
and
Mr
Roker
,
after
informing
him
that
he
could
retire
to
rest
at
whatever
hour
<EOS>
he
thought
proper
,
without
any
further
notice
or
formality
,
walked
off
,
leaving
him
standing
with
Sam
in
the
gallery
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
getting
dark
;
that
is
to
say
,
a
few
gas
jets
were
kindled
in
this
place
which
was
never
light
,
by
way
of
compliment
to
the
evening
,
which
had
set
in
outside
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
rather
warm
,
some
of
the
tenants
of
the
numerous
little
rooms
which
opened
into
the
gallery
on
either
hand
,
had
set
their
doors
ajar
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
peeped
into
them
as
he
passed
along
,
with
great
curiosity
and
interest
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
four
or
five
great
hulking
fellows
,
just
visible
through
a
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
,
were
engaged
in
noisy
and
riotous
conversation
over
half
-
emptied
pots
of
beer
,
or
playing
at
all
-
fours
with
a
very
greasy
pack
of
cards
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
adjoining
room
,
some
solitary
tenant
might
be
seen
poring
,
by
the
light
of
a
feeble
tallow
candle
,
over
a
bundle
of
soiled
and
tattered
papers
,
yellow
with
dust
and
dropping
to
pieces
from
age
,
writing
,
for
the
hundredth
time
,
some
lengthened
statement
of
his
grievances
,
for
the
perusal
of
some
great
man
whose
eyes
it
would
never
reach
,
or
whose
heart
it
would
never
touch
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
third
,
a
man
,
with
his
wife
and
a
whole
crowd
of
children
,
might
be
seen
making
up
a
scanty
bed
on
the
ground
,
or
upon
a
few
chairs
,
for
the
younger
ones
to
pass
the
night
in
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
a
fourth
,
and
a
fifth
,
and
a
sixth
,
and
a
seventh
,
the
noise
,
and
the
beer
,
and
the
tobacco
smoke
,
and
the
cards
,
all
came
over
again
in
greater
force
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
galleries
themselves
,
and
more
especially
on
the
stair
-
cases
,
there
lingered
a
great
number
of
people
,
who
came
there
,
some
because
their
rooms
were
empty
and
lonesome
,
others
because
their
rooms
were
full
and
hot
;
the
greater
part
because
they
were
restless
and
uncomfortable
,
and
not
possessed
of
the
secret
of
exactly
knowing
what
to
do
with
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
many
classes
of
people
here
,
from
the
labouring
man
in
his
fustian
jacket
,
to
the
broken
-
down
spendthrift
in
his
shawl
dressing
-
gown
,
most
appropriately
out
at
elbows
;
but
there
was
the
same
air
about
them
all
---
a
kind
of
listless
,
jail
-
bird
,
careless
swagger
,
a
vagabondish
who's
-
afraid
sort
of
bearing
,
which
is
wholly
indescribable
in
words
,
but
which
any
man
can
understand
in
one
moment
if
he
wish
,
by
setting
foot
in
the
nearest
debtors
"
prison
,
and
looking
at
the
very
first
group
of
people
he
sees
there
,
with
the
same
interest
as
Mr
Pickwick
did
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
strikes
me
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
leaning
over
the
iron
rail
at
the
stair
-
head-'it
<EOS>
strikes
me
,
<EOS>
Sam
,
that
imprisonment
for
debt
is
scarcely
any
punishment
at
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Think
not
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
how
these
fellows
drink
,
and
smoke
,
and
roar
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
impossible
that
they
can
mind
it
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
that
's
just
the
wery
thing
,
Sir
,
"
rejoined
Sam
,
<EOS>
"
they
do
n't
mind
it
;
it
's
a
reg'lar
holiday
to

all

It

said
Mr

,
after
a

moments
"
reflection
,
"
quite

<EOS>
"
P'raps

there

observed
Mr
Weller
,
in
a
ruminative
tone
,
"
but
I
never

run

"
   
<EOS>
"
In
other

I

said
Mr

,
"
he
got
into

Just

:
and
that
wos
true
,
sure
enough
,
for
wen
he
wanted
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
any
new
-
comer
,
he
used
to
pull
out
a
little
limp
card
vith
them
words
on
it
and
nothin'
else
;
in
consideration
of
vich

vos

called

<EOS>
The
turnkey
takes
a
fixed
look
at
him
,
and
at
last
he
says
in
a
solemn
manner
,
"
Tventy
,
"
he
says
,
"
I
'll
trust
you

you
Wo

<EOS>
"
No

I
hope
I

somethin'
better

"
says
the
little
man
;
and
as
he
said
it
he
hit
his
little
vesket
wery
hard
,
and
then
a
tear
started
out
o
'
each
eye
,
which
wos
wery
extraordinary
,
for
it
<EOS>
wos
supposed
as
water
never
touched
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
shook
the
turnkey
by
the
hand
;
out
he
vent
---
"
   
"
And
never
came
back
again
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wrong
for
vunce
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
,
"
for
back
<EOS>
he
come
,
two
minits
afore

a

with
rage

sayin

how
he

been
nearly
run
over
by
a
hackney

coach

he
warn't
used

it
;
and
he
was
blowed
if
he
would
n't
write
to
the
lord

<EOS>
They
got
him
pacified
at
last
;
and
for
five
years
arter
that
,
he
never
even
so
much
as
peeped
out
o
'
the
lodge
gate
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
the
expiration
of
that
time
he
died
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
he
did
n't
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
got
a
curiosity
to
go
and
taste
the
beer
at
a
new
public
-
house
over
the
way
,
and
it
wos
such
a
wery
nice
parlour
,
that
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
go
there
every
night
,
which
he
did
for
a
long
time
,
always
comin
'
back
reg'lar
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afore
<EOS>
the
gate
shut
,
which
was
all
wery
snug
and
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
began
to
get
so
precious
jolly
,
that
he
used
to
forget
how
the
time
vent
,
or
care
nothin'
at
all
about
it
,
and
he
went
on
gettin
'
<EOS>
later
and
later
,
till
vun
night
his
old
friend
wos
just
a
-
shuttin
'
the
gate
---
<EOS>
had
turned
the
key
in
fact
---
wen
he
come
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
hard
,
Bill
,
"
he
says
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wot
,
ai
n't
you
come
home
yet
,
Tventy
?
"
says
the
turnkey
,
"
I
thought
you
wos
in
,
long
ago
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
was
n't
,
"
says
the
little
man
,
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
I
'll
tell
you
wot
<EOS>
it
is
,
my
friend
,
"
says
the
turnkey
,
openin
'
the
gate
wery
slow
and
sulky
,
"
it
's
my
"
pinion
as
you
've
got
into
bad
company
o
'
late
,
which
I
'm
wery
sorry
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
do
n't
wish
to
do
nothing
harsh
,
"
he
says
,
"
but
if
you
ca
n't
confine
yourself
to
steady
circles
,
and
find
your
vay
back
at
reg'lar
hours
,
as
sure
as
you
're
a

standin
'
there
,
I
'll
shut
you
out
altogether
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
little
man
was
seized
vith
a
wiolent
fit
o
'
tremblin
'
,
and
never
vent
outside
the
prison
walls
artervards
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
Sam
concluded
,
Mr
Pickwick
slowly
retraced
his
steps
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
few
thoughtful
turns
in
the
Painted
Ground
,
which
,
as
it
was
now
dark
,
was
nearly
deserted
,
he
intimated
to
Mr
Weller
that
he
thought
it
high
time
for
him
to
withdraw
for
the
night
;
requesting
him
to
seek
a
bed
in
some
adjacent
public
-
house
,
and
return
early
in
the
morning
,
to
make
arrangements
for
the
removal
of
his
master
's
wardrobe
from
the
George
and
Vulture
.
 
<EOS>
This
request
<EOS>
Mr
Samuel
Weller
prepared
to
obey
,
with
as
good
a
grace
as
he
could
assume
,
but
with
a
very
considerable
show
of
reluctance
nevertheless
.
 
<EOS>
He
even
went
so
far
as
to
essay
sundry
ineffectual
hints
regarding
the
expediency
of
stretching
himself
on
the
gravel
for
that
night
;
but
finding
Mr
Pickwick
obstinately
deaf
to
any
such
suggestions
,
finally
withdrew
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
no
disguising
the
fact
that
Mr
Pickwick
felt
very
low
-
spirited
and
uncomfortable
---
not
for
lack
of
society
,
for
the
prison
was
very
full
,
and
a
bottle
of
wine
would
at
once
have
purchased
the
utmost
good
-
fellowship
of
a
few
choice
spirits
,
without
any
more
formal
ceremony
of
introduction
;
but
he
was
alone
in
the
coarse
,
vulgar
crowd
,
and
felt
the
depression
of
spirits
and
sinking
of
heart
,
naturally
consequent
on
the
reflection
that
he
was
cooped
and
caged
up
,
without
a
prospect
of
liberation
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
idea
of
releasing
himself
by
ministering
to
the
sharpness
of
Dodson
&
Fogg
,
it
never
for
an
instant
entered
his
thoughts
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
frame
of
mind
he
turned
again
into
the
coffee
-
room
gallery
,
and
walked
slowly
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
The
place
was
intolerably
dirty
,
and
the
smell
of
tobacco
smoke
perfectly
suffocating
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
perpetual
slamming
and
banging
of
doors
as
the
people
went
in
and
out
;
and
the
noise
of
their
voices
and
footsteps
echoed
and
re
-
echoed
through
the
passages
constantly
.
 
<EOS>
A
young
woman
,
with
a
child
in
her
arms
,
who
seemed
scarcely
able
to
crawl
,
from
emaciation
and
misery
,
was
walking
up
and
down
the
passage
in
conversation
with
her
husband
,
who
had
no
other
place
to
see
her
in
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
passed
Mr
Pickwick
,
he
could
hear
the
female
sob
bitterly
;
and
once
she
burst
into
such
a
passion
of
grief
,
that
she
was
compelled
to
lean
against
the
wall
for
support
,
while
the
man
took
the
child
in
his
arms
,
and
tried
to
soothe
her
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
heart
was
really
too
full
to
bear
it
,
and
he
went
upstairs
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
although
the
warder
's
room
was
a
very
uncomfortable
one
(
being
,
in
every
point
of
decoration
and
convenience
,
several
hundred
degrees
inferior
to
the
common
infirmary
of
a
county
jail
)
,
it
had
at
present
the
merit
of
being
wholly
deserted
save
by
Mr
Pickwick
himself
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
sat
down
at
the
foot
of
his
little
iron
bedstead
,
and
began
to
wonder
how
much
a
year
the
warder
made
out
of
the
dirty
room
.
 
<EOS>
Having
satisfied
himself
,
by
mathematical
calculation
,
that
the
apartment
was
about
equal
in
annual
value
to
the
freehold
of
a
small
street
in
the
suburbs
of
London
,
he
took
to
wondering
what
possible
temptation
could
have
induced
a
dingy
-
looking
fly
that
was
crawling
over
his
pantaloons
,
to
come
into
a
close
prison
,
when
he
had
the
choice
of
so
many
airy
situations
---
a
course
of
meditation
which
led
him
to
the
irresistible
conclusion
that
the
insect
was
insane
.
 
<EOS>
After
settling
this
point
,
he
began
to
be
conscious
that
he
was
getting
sleepy
;
whereupon
he
took
his
nightcap
out
of
the
pocket
in
which
he
had
had
the
precaution
to
stow
it
in
the
morning
,
and
,
leisurely
undressing
himself
,
got
into
bed
and
fell
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bravo
!
 
<EOS>
Heel
over
toe
---
<EOS>
cut
and
shuffle
---
pay
away
at
it
,
Zephyr
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
smothered
if
the
opera
house
is
n't
your
proper
hemisphere
.
 
<EOS>
Keep
it
up
!
 
<EOS>
Hooray
!
"
 
<EOS>
These
expressions
,
delivered
in
a
most
boisterous
tone
,
and
accompanied
with
loud
peals
of
laughter
,
roused
Mr
Pickwick
from
one
of
those
sound
slumbers
which
,
lasting
in
reality
some
half
-
hour
,
seem
to
the
sleeper
to
have
been
protracted
for
three
weeks
or
a
month
.
   
<EOS>
The
voice
had
no
sooner
ceased
than
the
room
was
shaken
with
such
violence
that
the
windows
rattled
in
their
frames
,
and
the
bedsteads
trembled
again
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
started
up
,
and
remained
for
some
minutes
fixed
in
mute
astonishment
at
the
scene
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
floor
of
the
room
,
a
man
in
a
broad
-
skirted
green
coat
,
with
corduroy
knee
-
smalls
and
gray
cotton
stockings
,
was
performing
the
most
popular
steps
of
a
hornpipe
,
with
a
slang
and
burlesque
caricature
of
grace
and
lightness
,
which
,
combined
with
the
very
appropriate
character
of
his
costume
,
was
inexpressibly
absurd
.
 
<EOS>
Another
man
,
evidently
very
drunk
,
who
had
probably
been
tumbled
into
bed
by
his
companions
,
was
sitting
up
between
the
sheets
,
warbling
as
much
as
he
could
recollect
of
a
comic
song
,
with
the
most
intensely
sentimental
feeling
and
expression
;
while
a
third
,
seated
on
one
of
the
bedsteads
,
was
applauding
both
performers
with
the
air
of
a
profound
connoisseur
,
and
encouraging
them
by
such
ebullitions
of
feeling
as
had
already
roused
Mr
Pickwick
from
his
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
This
last
man
was
an
admirable
specimen
of
a
class
of
gentry
which
never
can
be
seen
in
full
perfection
but
in
such
places
---
they
may
be
met
with
,
in
an
imperfect
state
,
occasionally
about
stable
-
yards
and
Public
-
houses
;
but
they
never
attain
their
full
bloom
except
in
these
hot
-
beds
,
which
would
almost
seem
to
be
considerately
provided
by
the
legislature
for
the
sole
purpose
of
rearing
them
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
fellow
,
with
an
olive
complexion
,
long
dark
hair
,
and
very
thick
bushy
whiskers
meeting
under
his
chin
.
 
<EOS>
He
wore
no
neckerchief
,
as
he
had
been
playing
rackets
all
day
,
and
his
Open
shirt
collar
displayed
their
full
luxuriance
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
head
he
wore
one
of
the
common
eighteenpenny
French
skull
-
caps
,
with
a
gaudy
tassel
<EOS>
dangling
therefrom
,
very
happily
in
keeping
with
a
common
fustian
coat
.
 
<EOS>
His
legs
,
which
,
being
long
,
were
afflicted
with
weakness
,
graced
a
pair
of
Oxford
-
mixture
trousers
,
made
to
show
the
full
symmetry
of
those
limbs
.
 
<EOS>
Being
somewhat
negligently
braced
,
however
,
and
,
moreover
,
but
imperfectly
buttoned
,
they
fell
in
a
series
of
not
the
most
graceful
folds
over
a
pair
of
shoes
sufficiently
down
at
heel
to
display
a
pair
of
very
soiled
white
stockings
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
rakish
,
vagabond
smartness
,
and
a
kind
of
boastful
rascality
,
about
the
whole
man
,
that
was
worth
a
mine
of
gold
.
   
<EOS>
This
figure
was
the
first
to
perceive
that
Mr
Pickwick
was
looking
on
;
upon
which
he
winked
to
the
Zephyr
,
and
entreated
him
,
with
mock
gravity
,
not
to
wake
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
bless
the
gentleman
's
honest
heart
and
soul
!
"
said
the
Zephyr
,
turning
round
and
affecting
the
extremity
of
surprise
;
"
the
gentleman
is
awake
.
 
<EOS>
Hem
,
Shakespeare
!
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
,
Sir
?
 
<EOS>
How
is
Mary
and
Sarah
,
sir
?
<EOS>
and
the
dear
old
lady
at
home
,
Sir
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
have
the
kindness
to
put
my
compliments
into
the
first
little
parcel
you
're
sending
that
way
,
sir
,
and
say
that
I
would
have
sent
'em
before
,
only
I
was
afraid
they
might
be
broken
in
the
wagon
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
overwhelm
the
gentlemen
with
ordinary
civilities
when
you
see
he
's
anxious
to
have
something
to
drink
,
"
said
the
gentleman
with
the
whiskers
,
with
a
jocose
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
ask
the
gentleman
what
he
'll
take
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
I
quite
forgot
,
"
replied
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
will
you
take
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
take
port
wine
,
sir
,
or
sherry
wine
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
recommend
the
ale
,
sir
;
or
perhaps
you
'd
like
to
taste
the
porter
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Allow
me
to
have
the
felicity
of
hanging
up
your
nightcap
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
,
the
speaker
snatched
that
article
of
dress
from
Mr
Pickwick
's
head
,
and
fixed
it
in
a
twinkling
on
that
of
the
drunken
man
,
who
,
firmly
impressed
with
the
belief
that
he
was
delighting
a
numerous
assembly
,
continued
to
hammer
away
at
the
comic
song
in
the
most
melancholy
strains
imaginable
.
   
<EOS>
Taking
a
man
's
nightcap
from
his
brow
by
violent
means
,
and
adjusting
it
on
the
head
of
an
unknown
gentleman
,
of
dirty
exterior
,
however
ingenious
a
witticism
in
itself
,
is
unquestionably
one
of
those
which
come
under
the
denomination
of
practical
jokes
.
 
<EOS>
Viewing
the
matter
precisely
in
this
light
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
without
the
slightest
intimation
of
his
purpose
,
sprang
vigorously
out
of
bed
,
struck
the
Zephyr
<EOS>
so
smart
a
blow
in
the
chest
as
to
deprive
him
of
a
considerable
portion
of
the
commodity
which
sometimes
bears
his
name
,
and
then
,
recapturing
his
nightcap
,
boldly
placed
himself
in
an
attitude
of
defence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
gasping
no
less
from
excitement
than
from
the
expenditure
of
so
much
energy
,
"
come
on
---
both
of
you
---
both
of
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
liberal
invitation
the
worthy
gentleman
communicated
a
revolving
motion
to
his
clenched
fists
,
by
way
of
appalling
his
antagonists
with
a
display
of
science
.
   
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
Mr
Pickwick
's
very
unexpected
gallantry
,
or
it
might
have
been
the
complicated
manner
in
which
he
had
got
himself
out
of
bed
,
and
fallen
all
in
a
mass
upon
the
hornpipe
man
,
that
touched
his
adversaries
.
 
<EOS>
Touched
they
were
;
for
,
instead
of
then
and
there
making
an
attempt
to
commit
man
-
slaughter
,
<EOS>
as
Mr
Pickwick
implicitly
believed
they
would
have
done
,
they
paused
,
stared
at
each
other
a
short
time
,
and
finally
laughed
outright
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
you
're
a
trump
,
and
I
like
you
all
the
better
for
it
,
"
said
the
Zephyr
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
jump
into
bed
again
,
or
you
'll
catch
the
rheumatics
.
 
<EOS>
No
malice
,
I
hope
?
"
said
the
man
,
extending
a
hand
the
size
of
the
yellow
clump
of
fingers
which
sometimes
swings
over
a
glover
's
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
great
alacrity
;
for
,
<EOS>
now
that
the
excitement
was
over
,
he
began
to
feel
rather
cool
about
the
legs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Allow
me
the
H
-
onour
,
"
said
the
gentleman
with
the
whiskers
,
presenting
his
dexter
hand
,
and
aspirating
the
h.
   
<EOS>
"
With
much
pleasure
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
and
having
executed
a
very
long
and
solemn
shake
,
he
got
into
bed
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Smangle
,
sir
,
"
said
the
man
with
the
whiskers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mine
is
Mivins
,
"
said
the
man
in
the
stockings
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
delighted
to
hear
it
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hem
,
"
coughed
Mr
Smangle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
speak
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
did
not
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Smangle
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
was
very
genteel
and
pleasant
;
and
,
to
make
matters
still
more
comfortable
,
Mr
Smangle
assured
Mr
Pickwick
a
great
many
more
times
that
he
entertained
a
very
high
respect
for
the
feelings
of
a
gentleman
;
which
sentiment
,
indeed
,
did
him
infinite
credit
,
as
he
could
be
in
no
wise
supposed
to
understand
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
through
the
court
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Smangle
.
<EOS>
"
Through
the
what
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Through
the
court

Portugal
Street
---
the
Court

Relief
of

You

"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

no

"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
am
not

"
   
<EOS>
"
Going
out
,
perhaps
?
"
suggested
Mr
Mivins
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
not
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
refuse
to
pay
some
damages
,
and
am
here
in
consequence
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Mr
Smangle
,
<EOS>
"
paper
has
been
my
ruin
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
stationer
,
I
presume
,
Sir
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
innocently
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stationer
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
;
confound
and
curse
me
!
 
<EOS>
Not
so
low
as
that
.
<EOS>
No
trade
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
say
paper
,
I
mean
bills

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
use
the
word
in
that
sense
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Damme
!
 
<EOS>
A
gentleman
must
expect
reverses
,
"
said
Smangle
.
<EOS>
"
What
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
Here
am
I
in
the
Fleet
Prison
.
 
<EOS>
Well
;
good
.
 
<EOS>
What
then
?
 
<EOS>
I
'm
none
the
worse
for
that
,
am
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
,
"
replied
Mr
Mivins
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
was
quite
right
;
for
,
so
far
from
Mr
Smangle
being
any
the
worse
for
it
,
he
was
something
the
better
,
inasmuch
as
to
qualify
himself
for
the
place
,
he
had
attained
gratuitous
possession
of
certain
articles
of
jewellery
,
which
,
long
before
that
,
had
found
their
way
to
the
pawnbroker
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
;
but
come
,
"
said
Mr
Smangle
;
"
this
is
dry
work
.
 
<EOS>
Let
's
rinse
our
mouths
with
a
drop
of
burnt
sherry
;
the
last
-
comer
shall
stand
it
,
Mivins
shall
fetch
it
,
and
I
'll
help
to
drink
it
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
a
fair
and
gentlemanlike
division
of
labour
,
anyhow
.
 
<EOS>
Curse
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Unwilling
to
hazard
another
quarrel
,
Mr
Pickwick
gladly
assented
to
the
proposition
,
and
consigned
the
money
to
Mr
Mivins
,
who
,
as
it
was
nearly
eleven
o'clock
,
lost
no
time
in
repairing
to
the
coffee
-
room
on
his
errand
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
whispered
Smangle
,
the
moment
his
friend
had
left
the
room
;
"
what
did
you
give
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Half
a
sovereign
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
a
devilish
pleasant
gentlemanly
dog
,
"
said
Mr
Smangle
;
---
"
infernal
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
anybody
more
so
;
<EOS>
but
---
"
Here
Mr
Smangle
stopped
short
,
and
shook
his
head
dubiously
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
think
there
is
any
probability
of
his
appropriating
the
money
to
his
own
use
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
Mind
,
I
do
n't
say
that
;
I
expressly
say
that
he
's
a
devilish
gentlemanly
fellow
,
"
said
Mr
Smangle
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
think
,
perhaps
,
if
somebody
went
down
,
just
to
see
that
he
did
n't
dip
his
beak
into
the
jug
by
accident
,
or
make
some
confounded
mistake
in
losing
the
money
as
he
came
upstairs
,
it
would
be
as
well
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
you
sir
,
just
run
downstairs
,
and
look
after
that
gentleman
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
This
request
was
addressed
to
a
little
timid
-
looking
,
nervous
man
,
whose
appearance
bespoke
great
poverty
,
and
who
had
been
crouching
on
his
bedstead
all
this
while
,
apparently
stupefied
by
the
novelty
of
his
situation
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
where
the
coffee
-
room
is
,
"
said
Smangle
;
"
just
run
down
,
and
tell
that
gentleman
you
've
come
to
help
him
up
with
the
jug
.
 
<EOS>
Or
---
stop
<EOS>
---
I
'll
tell
you
<EOS>
what
---
I
'll
tell
you
how
we
'll
do
him
,
"
said
Smangle
,
with
a
cunning
look
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Send
down
word
that
he
's
to
spend
the
change
in
cigars
.
<EOS>
Capital
thought
.
 
<EOS>
Run
and
tell
him
that
<EOS>
;
d'ye
hear
?
 
<EOS>
They
sha
n't
be
wasted
,
"
continued
Smangle
,
turning
to
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
I'LL
smoke
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
manoeuvring
was
so
exceedingly
ingenious
and
,
withal
,
performed
with
such
immovable
composure
and
coolness
,
that
Mr
Pickwick
would
have
had
no
wish
to
disturb
it
,
even
if
he
had
had
the
power
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
short
time
Mr
Mivins
returned
,
bearing
the
sherry
,
which
Mr
Smangle
dispensed
in
two
little
cracked
mugs
;
considerately
remarking
,
with
reference
to
himself
,
that
a
gentleman
must
not
be
particular
under
such
circumstances
,
and
that
,
for
his
part
,
he
was
not
too
proud
to
drink
out
of
the
jug
.
<EOS>
In
which
,
to
show
his
sincerity
,
he
forthwith
pledged
the
company
in
a
draught
which
half
emptied
it
.
   
<EOS>
An
excellent
understanding
having
been
by
these
means
promoted
,
Mr
Smangle
proceeded
to
entertain
his
hearers
with
a
relation
of
divers
romantic
adventures
in
which
he
had
been
from
time
to
time
engaged
,
involving
various
interesting
anecdotes
of
a
thoroughbred
horse
,
and
a
magnificent
Jewess
,
both
of
surpassing
beauty
,
and
much
coveted
by
the
nobility
and
gentry
of
these
kingdoms
.
   
<EOS>
Long
before
these
elegant
extracts
from
the
biography
of
a
gentleman
were
concluded
,
Mr
Mivins
had
betaken
himself
to
bed
,
and
had
set
in
snoring
for
the
night
,
leaving
the
timid
stranger
and
Mr
Pickwick
to
the
full
benefit
of
Mr
Smangle
's
experiences
.
   
<EOS>
Nor
were
the
two
last
-
named
gentlemen
as
much
edified
as
they
might
have
been
by
the
moving
passages
narrated
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
had
been
in
a
state
of
slumber
for
some
time
,
when
he
had
a
faint
perception
of
the
drunken
man
bursting
out
afresh
with
the
comic
song
,
and
receiving
from
Mr
Smangle
a
gentle
intimation
,
through
the
medium
of
the
water
-
jug
,
that
his
audience
was
not
musically
disposed
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
then
once
again
dropped
off
to
sleep
,
with
a
confused
consciousness
that
Mr
Smangle
was
still
engaged
in
relating
a
long
story
,
the
chief
point
of
which
appeared
to
be
that
,
on
some
occasion
particularly
stated
and
set
forth
,
he
had
"
done
"
a
bill
and
a
gentleman
at
the
same
time

Chapter

<EOS>
Illustrative
,
like
the
preceding
one
,
of
the
old
proverb
,
that
adversity
brings
a
man
acquainted
with
strange
bedfellows
---
likewise
containing
Mr
Pickwick
's
extraordinary
and
startling
announcement
to
Mr
Samuel
Weller
 
<EOS>
When
Mr
Pickwick
opened
his
eyes
next
morning
,
the
first
object
upon
which
they
rested
was
Samuel
Weller
,
seated
upon
a
small
black
portmanteau
,
intently
regarding
,
apparently
in
a
condition
of
profound
abstraction
,
the
stately
figure
of
the
dashing
Mr
Smangle
;
while
Mr
Smangle
himself
,
who
was
already
partially
dressed
,
was
seated
on
his
bedstead
,
occupied
in
the
desperately
hopeless
attempt
of
staring
Mr
Weller
out
of
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
We
say
desperately
hopeless
,
because
Sam
,
with
a
comprehensive
gaze
which
took
in
Mr
Smangle
's
cap
,
feet
,
head
,
face
,
legs
,
and
whiskers
,
all
at
the
same
time
,
continued
to
look
steadily
on
,
with
every
demonstration
of
lively
satisfaction
,
but
with
no
more
regard
to
Mr
Smangle
's
personal
sentiments
on
the
subject
than
he
would
have
displayed
had
he
been
inspecting
a
wooden
statue
,
or
a
straw
-
embowelled
Guy
Fawkes
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
;
will
you
know
me
again
?
"
said
Mr
Smangle
,
with
a
frown
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'd
svear
to
you
anyveres
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Sam
cheerfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
impertinent
to
a
gentleman
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Smangle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
on
no
account
,
"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
'll
tell
me
wen
he
wakes
,
I
'll
be
upon
the
wery
best
extra
-
super
behaviour
!
"
 
<EOS>
This
observation
,
having
a
remote
tendency
to
imply
that
Mr
Smangle
was
no
gentleman
,
kindled
his
ire
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mivins
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Smangle
,
with
a
passionate
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
office
?
"
<EOS>
replied
that
gentleman
from
his
couch
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
the
devil
is
this
fellow
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
'
Gad
,
"
said
Mr
Mivins
,
looking
lazily
out
from
under
the
bed
-
clothes
,
"
I
ought
to
ask
YOU
that
.
 
<EOS>
Has
n't
he
any
business
here
?
"
   
"
No
,
"
replied
Mr
Smangle
.
<EOS>
"
Then
knock
him
downstairs
,
and
tell
him
not
to
presume
to
get
up
till
I
come
and
kick
him
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Mivins
;
with
this
prompt
advice
that
excellent
gentleman
again
betook
himself
to
slumber
.
   
<EOS>
The
conversation
exhibiting
these
unequivocal
symptoms
of
verging
on
the
personal
<EOS>
,
Mr
Pickwick
deemed
it
a
fit
point
at
which
to
interpose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
rejoined
that
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Has
anything
new
occurred
since
last
night
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothin'
partickler
,
sir
,
"
replied
Sam
,
glancing
at
Mr
Smangle
's
whiskers
;
"
the
late
prewailance
of
a
close
and
confined
atmosphere
has
been
rayther
favourable
to
the
growth
of
veeds

of
an
alarmin

but
vith
that
'
ere
exception
things

quiet
enough

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
get
up
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
give
me
some
clean
things
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whatever
hostile
intentions
Mr
Smangle
might
have
entertained
,
his
thoughts
were
speedily
diverted
by
the
unpacking
of
the
portmanteau
;
the
contents
of
which
appeared
to
impress
him
at
once
with
a
most
favourable
opinion
,
not
only
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
but
of
Sam
also
,
who
,
he
took
an
early
opportunity
of
declaring
in
a
tone
of
voice
loud
enough
for
that
eccentric
personage
to
overhear
,
was
a
regular
thoroughbred
original
,
and
consequently
the
very
man
after
his
own
heart
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
the
affection
he
conceived
for
him
knew
no
limits
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
is
there
anything
I
can
do
for
you
,
my
dear
Sir
?
"
said
Smangle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
that
I
am
aware
of
,
I
am
obliged
to
you
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
linen
that
you
want
sent

<EOS>
I
know
a
delightful

twice
a

and

<EOS>
Thus
spake
Mr
Smangle
,
edging
himself
meanwhile
as
near
as
possible
to
the
portmanteau
,
and
beaming
forth
looks
of
the
most
fervent
and
disinterested
friendship
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
you
want
to
give
out
for
the
man
to
brush
,
my
dear
creature
,
is
there
?
"
resumed
Smangle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothin'
whatever
,
my
fine
feller
,
"
rejoined
Sam
,
taking
the
reply
into
his
own
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
"
P'raps
if
vun
of
us
wos
to
brush
,
without
troubling
the
man
,
it
'
ud
be
more
agreeable
for
all
parties
,
as
the
schoolmaster
said
when
the
young
gentleman
objected
to
being
flogged
by
the
butler
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
there
's
nothing
I
can
send
in
my
little
box
to
the
washer
-
woman
's
,
is
there
?
"
said
Smangle
,
turning
from
Sam
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
an
air
of
some
discomfiture
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothin'
whatever
,
Sir
,
"
retorted
Sam
;
"
I
'm
afeered
the
little
box
must
be
chock
full
o
'
your
own
as
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
speech
was
accompanied
with
such
a
very
expressive
look
at
that
particular
portion
of
Mr
Smangle
's
attire
,
by
the
appearance
of
which
the
skill
of
laundresses
in
getting
up
gentlemen
's
linen
is
generally
tested
,
that
he
was
fain
to
turn
upon
his
heel
,
and
,
for
the
present
at
any
rate
,
to
give
up
all
design
on
Mr
Pickwick
's
purse
and
wardrobe
.
 
<EOS>
He
accordingly
retired
in
dudgeon
to
the
racket
-
ground
,
where
he
made
a
light
and
whole
-
some
breakfast
on
a
couple
of
the
cigars
which
had
been
purchased
on
the
previous
night
.
<EOS>
Mr
Mivins
,
who
was
no
smoker
,
and
whose
account
for
small
articles
of
chandlery
had
also
reached
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
slate
,
and
been
"
carried
over
"
to
the
other
side
,
remained
in
bed
,
and
,
in
his
own
words
,
"
took
it
out
in
sleep
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
breakfasting
in
a
small
closet
attached
to
the
coffee
-
room
,
which
bore
the
imposing
title
of
the
Snuggery
,
the
temporary
inmate
of
which
,
in
consideration
of
a
small
additional
charge
,
had
the
unspeakable
advantage
of
overhearing
all
the
conversation
in
the
coffee
-
room
aforesaid
;
and
,
after
despatching
Mr
Weller
on
some
necessary
errands
,
Mr
Pickwick
repaired
to
the
lodge
,
to
consult
Mr
Roker
concerning
his
future
accommodation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Accommodation
,
eh
?
"
said
that
gentleman
,
consulting
a
large
book
.
 
<EOS>
"
Plenty
of
that
,
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
Your
chummage
ticket
will
be
on
twenty
-
seven

"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
what
,
did
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
chummage
ticket

"
replied
Mr
Roker
;
"
you
're
up
to
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
said
Mr
Roker
,
"
it
's
as
plain
as
Salisbury
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
have
a
chummage
ticket
upon
twenty
-
seven
in
the
third
,
and
them
as
is
in
the
room
<EOS>
will
be
your
chums

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
there
many
of
them
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
dubiously
.
   
<EOS>
"
Three
,
"
replied
Mr
Roker
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
coughed
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
of
'em
's
a
parson
,
"
said
Mr
Roker
,
filling
up
a
little
piece
of
paper
as
he
spoke
;
"
another
's
a
butcher
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
butcher
,
"
repeated
Mr
Roker
,
giving
the
nib
of
his
pen
a
tap
on
the
desk
to
cure
it
of
a
disinclination
to
mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
thorough
-
paced
goer
he
used
to
be
sure
-
ly
!
 
<EOS>
You
remember
Tom
Martin
,
Neddy
?
"
said
Roker
,
appealing
to
another
man
in
the
lodge
,
who
was
paring
the
mud
off
his
shoes
with
a
five
-
and
-
twenty
-
bladed
pocket
-
knife
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
,
"
replied
the
party
addressed
,
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
personal
pronoun
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
dear
eyes
!
"
said
Mr
Roker
,
shaking
his
head
slowly
from
side
to
side
,
and
gazing
abstractedly
out
of
the
grated
windows
before
him
,
as
if
he
were
fondly
recalling
some
peaceful
scene
of
his
early
youth
;
"
it
seems
but
yesterday
that
he
whopped
the
coal
-
heaver
down
Fox
-
under
-
the
-
Hill
by
the
wharf
there
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
see
him
now
,
a
-
coming
up
the
Strand
between
the
two
street
-
keepers
,
a
little
sobered
by
the
bruising
,
with
a
patch
o
'
winegar
and
brown
paper
over
his
right
eyelid
,
and
that
'
ere
lovely
bulldog
,
as
pinned
the
little

,
a

following
at

heels
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
rum
thing
time
is
,
ai
n't
it
,
Neddy
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
to
whom
these
observations
were
addressed
,
who
appeared
of
a
taciturn
and
thoughtful
cast
,
merely
echoed
the
inquiry
;
Mr
Roker
,
shaking
off
the
poetical
and
gloomy
train
of
thought
into
which
he
had
been
betrayed
,
descended
to
the
common
business
of
life
,
and
resumed
his
pen
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
what
the
third
gentlemen
is
?
"
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
,
not
very
much
gratified
by
this
description
of
his
future
associates
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
Simpson
,
Neddy
?
"
said
Mr
Roker
,
turning
to
his
companion
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
Simpson
?
"
said
Neddy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
him
in
twenty
-
seven
in
the
third
,
that
this
gentleman
's
going
to
be
chummed
on
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
him
!
<EOS>
"
replied
Neddy
;
"
he
's
nothing
exactly
.
 
<EOS>
He
WAS
a
horse
chaunter
<EOS>
:
he
's
a
leg
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
so
I
thought
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Roker
,
closing
the
book
,
and
placing
the
small
piece
of
paper
in
Mr
Pickwick
's
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
ticket
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Very
much
perplexed
by
this
summary
disposition
of
this
person
,
Mr
Pickwick
walked
back
into
the
prison
,
revolving
in
his
mind
what
he
had
better
do
.
 
<EOS>
Convinced
,
however
,
that
before
he
took
any
other
steps
it
would
be
advisable
to
see
,
and
hold
personal
converse
with
,
the
three
gentlemen
with
whom
it
was
proposed
to
quarter
him
,
he
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
third
flight
.
   
<EOS>
After
groping
about
in
the
gallery
for
some
time
,
attempting
in
the
dim
light
to
decipher
the
numbers
on
the
different
doors
,
he
at
length
appealed
to
a
pot
-
boy
,
who
happened
to
be
pursuing
his
morning
occupation
of
gleaning
for
pewter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Which
is
twenty
-
seven
,
my
good
fellow
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Five
doors
farther
on
,
"
replied
the
pot
-
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
likeness
of
a
man
being
hung
,
and
smoking
the
while
,
chalked
outside
the
door
.
"
   
<EOS>
Guided
by
this
direction
,
Mr
Pickwick
proceeded
slowly
along
the
gallery
until
he
encountered
the
"
portrait
of
a
gentleman
,
"
above
described
,
upon
whose
countenance
he
tapped
,
with
the
knuckle
of
his
forefinger
---
gently
at
first
,
and
then
audibly
.
 
<EOS>
After
repeating
this
process
several
times
without
effect
,
he
ventured
to
open
the
door
and
peep
in
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
man
in
the
room
,
and
he
was
leaning
out
of
window
as
far
as
he
could
without
overbalancing
himself
,
endeavouring
,
with
great
perseverance
,
to
spit
upon
the
crown
of
the
hat
of
a
personal
friend
on
the
parade
below
.
 
<EOS>
As
neither
speaking
,
coughing
,
sneezing
,
knocking
,
nor
any
other
ordinary
mode
of
attracting
attention
,
made
this
person
aware
of
the
presence
of
a
visitor
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
after
some
delay
,
stepped
up
to
the
window
,
and
pulled
him
gently
by
the
coat
tail
.
 
<EOS>
The
individual
brought
in
his
head
and
shoulders
with
great
swiftness
,
and
surveying
Mr
Pickwick
from
head
to
foot
,
demanded
in
a
surly
tone
what
the
---
something
beginning
with
a
capital
H
---
he
wanted
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
consulting
his
ticket
---
"
<EOS>
I
believe
this
is
twenty
-
seven
in
the
third
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
replied
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
here
in
consequence
of
receiving
this
bit
of
paper
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hand
it
over
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
complied
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
Roker
might
have
chummed
you
somewhere
else
,
"
said
Mr
Simpson
(
for
it
was
the
leg
)
<EOS>
,
after
a
very
discontented
sort
of
a
pause
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
thought
so
also
;
but
,
under
all
the
circumstances
,
he
considered
it
a
matter
of
sound
policy
to
be
silent
.
<EOS>
Mr
Simpson
mused
for
a
few
moments
after
this
,
and
then
,
thrusting
his
head
out
of
the
window
,
gave
a
shrill
whistle
,
and
pronounced
some
word
aloud
,
several
times
.
 
<EOS>
What
the
word
was
,
Mr
Pickwick
could
not
distinguish
;
but
he
rather
inferred
that
it
must
be
some
nickname
which
distinguished
Mr
Martin
,
from
the
fact
of
a
great
number
of
gentlemen
on
the
ground
below
,
immediately
proceeding
to
cry
"
Butcher
!
"
<EOS>
in
imitation
of
the
tone
in
which
that
useful
class
of
society
are
wo
nt
,
diurnally
,
to
make
their
presence
known
at
area
railings
.
   
<EOS>
Subsequent
occurrences
confirmed
the
accuracy
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
impression
;
for
,
in
a
few
seconds
,
a
gentleman
,
prematurely
broad
for
his
years
,
clothed
in
a
professional
blue
jean
frock
and
top
-
boots
with
circular
toes
,
entered
the
room
nearly
out
of
breath
,
closely
followed
by
another
gentleman
in
very
shabby
black
,
and
a
sealskin
cap
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
gentleman
,
who
fastened
his
coat
all
the
way
up
to
his
chin
by
means
of
a
pin
and
a
button
alternately
,
had
a
very
coarse
red
face
,
and
looked
like
a
drunken
chaplain
;
which
,
indeed
,
he
was
.
   
<EOS>
These
two
gentlemen
having
by
turns
perused
Mr
Pickwick
's
billet
,
the
one
expressed
his
opinion
that
it
was
"
a
rig
,
"
and
the
other
his
conviction
that
it
was
"
a
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
Having
recorded
their
feelings
in
these
very
intelligible
terms
,
they
looked
at
Mr
Pickwick
and
each
other
in
awkward
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
an
aggravating
thing
,
just
as
we
got
the
beds
so
snug
,
"
said
the
chaplain
,
looking
at
three
dirty
mattresses
,
each
rolled
up
in
a
blanket
;
which
occupied
one
corner
of
the
room
during
the
day
,
and
formed
a
kind
of
slab
,
on
which
were
placed
an
old
cracked
basin
,
ewer
,
and
soap
-
dish
,
of
common
yellow
earthenware
,
with
a
blue
flower
---
"
very
aggravating
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Martin
expressed
the
same
opinion
in
rather
stronger
terms
;
Mr
Simpson
,
after
having
let
a
variety
of
expletive
adjectives
loose
upon
society
without
any
substantive
to
accompany
them
,
tucked
up
his
sleeves
,
and
began
to
wash
the
greens
for
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
While
this
was
going
on
,
Mr
Pickwick
had
been
eyeing
the
room
,
which
was
filthily
dirty
,
and
smelt
intolerably
close
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
vestige
of
either
carpet
,
curtain
,
or
blind
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
not
even
a
closet
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Unquestionably
there
were
but
few
things
to
put
away
,
if
there
had
been
one
;
but
,
<EOS>
however
few
in
number
,
or
small
in
individual
amount
,
still
,
remnants
of
loaves
and
pieces
of
cheese
,
and
damp
towels
,
and
scrags
of
meat
,
and
articles
of
wearing
apparel
,
and
mutilated
crockery
,
and
bellows
without
nozzles
,
and
toasting
-
forks
without
prongs
,
do
present
somewhat
of
an
uncomfortable
appearance
when
they
are
scattered
about
the
floor
of
a
small
apartment
,
which
is
the
common
sitting
and
sleeping
room
of
three
idle
men
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
this
can
be
managed
somehow
,
"
said
the
butcher
,
after
a
pretty
long
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
will
you
take
to
go
out
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
say
?
<EOS>
I
hardly
understand
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
will
you
take
to
be
paid
out
?
"
said
the
butcher
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
regular
chummage
is
two
-
and
-
six
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
take
three
bob
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
a
bender
,
"
suggested
the
clerical
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
do
n't
mind
that
;
it
's
only
twopence
<EOS>
a
piece
more
,
"
said
Mr
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
,
now
?
 
<EOS>
We
'll
pay
you
out
for
three
-
and
-
sixpence
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
Come
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
stand
a
gallon
of
beer
down
,
"
chimed
in
Mr
Simpson
.
"
There
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
drink
it
on
the
spot
,
"
said
the
chaplain
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
!
"
   
"
I
really
am
so
wholly
ignorant
of
the
rules
of
this
place
,
"
returned
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
that
I
do
not
yet
comprehend
you
.
 
<EOS>
Can
I
live
anywhere
else
?
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
could
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
inquiry
Mr
Martin
looked
,
with
a
countenance
of
excessive
surprise
,
at
his
two
friends
,
and
then
each
gentleman
pointed
with
his
right
thumb
over
his
left
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
This
action
imperfectly
described
in
words
by
the
very
feeble
term
of
"
over
the
left
,
"
when
performed
by
any
number
of
ladies
or
gentlemen
who
are
accustomed
to
act
in
unison
,
has
a
very
graceful
and
airy
effect
;
its
expression
is
one
of
light
and
playful
sarcasm
.
   
<EOS>
"
CAN
you
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Mr
Martin
,
with
a
smile
of
pity
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
if
I
knew
as
little
of
life
as
that
,
I
'd
eat
my
hat
and
swallow
the
buckle
whole
,
"
said
the
clerical
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
would
I
,
"
added
the
sporting
one
solemnly
.
   
<EOS>
After
this
introductory
preface
,
the
three
chums
informed
Mr
Pickwick
,
in
a
breath
,
that
money
was
,
in
the
Fleet
,
<EOS>
just
what
money
was
out
of
it
;
that
it
would
instantly
procure
him
almost
anything
he
desired
;
and
that
,
supposing
he
had
it
,
and
had
no
objection
to
spend
it
,
if
he
only
signified
his
wish
to
have
a
room
to
himself
,
he
might
take
possession
of
one
,
furnished
and
fitted
to
boot
,
in
half
an
hour
's
time
.
   
<EOS>
With
this
the
parties
separated
,
very
much
to
their
common
satisfaction
;
Mr
Pickwick
once
more
retracing
his
steps
to
the
lodge
,
and
the
three
companions
adjourning
to
the
coffee
-
room
,
there
to
spend
the
five
shillings
which
the
clerical
gentleman
had
,
with
admirable
prudence
and
foresight
,
borrowed
of
him
for
the
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
knowed
it
!
"
said
Mr
Roker
,
with
a
chuckle
,
when
Mr
Pickwick
stated
the
object
with
which
he
had
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
I
say
so
,
Neddy
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
philosophical
owner
of
the
universal
penknife
growled
an
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
knowed
you
'd
want
a
room
for
yourself
,
bless
you
!
"
said
Mr
Roker
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
want
some
furniture
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
hire
that
of
me
,
I
suppose
?
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
reg'lar
thing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
great
pleasure
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
capital
room
up
in
the
coffee
-
room
flight
,
that
belongs
to
a
Chancery
prisoner
,
"
said
Mr
Roker
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
'll
stand
you
in
a
pound
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
do
n't
mind
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Just
step
there
with
me
,
"
said
Roker
,
taking
up
his
hat
with
great
alacrity
;
"
the
matter
's
settled
in
five
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
why
did
n't
you
say
at
first
that
you
was
willing
to
come
down
handsome
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
matter
was
soon
arranged
,
as
the
turnkey
had
foretold
.
<EOS>
The
Chancery
prisoner
had
been
there
long
enough
to
have
lost
his
friends
,
fortune
,
home
,
and
happiness
,
and
to
have
acquired
the
right
of
having
a
room
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
laboured
,
however
,
under
the
inconvenience
of
often
wanting
a
morsel
of
bread
,
he
eagerly
listened
to
Mr
Pickwick
's
proposal
to
rent
the
apartment
,
and
readily
covenanted
and
agreed
to
yield
him
up
the
sole
and
undisturbed
possession
thereof
,
in
consideration
of
the
weekly
payment
of
twenty
shillings
;
from
which
fund
he
furthermore
contracted
to
pay
out
any
person
or
persons
that
might
be
chummed
upon
it
.
   
<EOS>
As
they
struck
the
bargain
,
Mr
Pickwick
surveyed
him
with
a
painful
interest
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
,
gaunt
,
cadaverous
man
,
in
an
old
greatcoat
and
slippers
,
with
sunken
cheeks
,
and
a
restless
,
eager
eye
.
 
<EOS>
His
lips
were
bloodless
,
and
his
bones
sharp
and
thin
.
 
<EOS>
God
help
him
!
<EOS>
the
iron
teeth
of
confinement
and
privation
had
been
slowly
filing
him
down
for
twenty
years
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
where
will
you
live
meanwhile
,
Sir
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
he
laid
the
amount
of
the
first
week
's
rent
,
in
advance
,
on
the
tottering
table
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
gathered
up
the
money
with
a
trembling
hand
,
and
replied
that
he
did
n't
know
yet
;
he
must
go
and
see
where
he
could
move
his
bed
to
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
laying
his
hand
gently
and
compassionately
on
his
arm
---
"
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
you
will
have
to
live
in
some
noisy
,
crowded
place
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
pray
,
consider
this
room
your
own
when
you
want
quiet
,
or
when
any
of
your
friends
come
to
see
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Friends
!
"
interposed
the
man
,
in
a
voice
which
rattled
in
his
throat
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
lay
dead
at
the
bottom
of
the
deepest
mine
in
the
world
;
tight
screwed
down
and
soldered
in
my
coffin
;
rotting
in
the
dark
and
filthy
ditch
that
drags
its
slime
along
,
beneath
the
foundations
of
this
prison
;
I
could
not
be
more
forgotten
or
unheeded
than
I
am
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
dead
man
;
dead
to
society
,
without
the
pity
they
bestow
on
those
whose
souls
have
passed
to
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
Friends
to
see
me
!
 
<EOS>
My
God
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
sunk
,
from
the
prime
of
life
into
old
age
,
in
this
place
,
and
there
is
not
one
to
raise
his
hand
above
my
bed
when
I
lie
dead
upon
it
,
and
say
,
"
It
is
a
blessing
he
is
gone
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
The
excitement
,
which
had
cast
an
unwonted
light
over
the
man
's
face
,
while
he
spoke
,
subsided
as
he
concluded
;
and
pressing
his
withered
hands
together
in
a
hasty
and
disordered
manner
,
he
shuffled
from
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rides
rather
rusty
,
"
said
Mr
Roker
,
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
they
're
like
the
elephants
.
 
<EOS>
They
feel
it
now
and
then
,
and
it
makes
'em
wild
!
"
   
<EOS>
Having
made
this
deeply
-
sympathising
remark
,
Mr
Roker
entered
upon
his
arrangements
with
such
expedition
,
that
in
a
short
time
the
room
was
furnished
with
a
carpet
,
six
chairs
,
a
table
,
a
sofa
bedstead
,
a
tea
-
kettle
,
and
various
small
articles
,
on
hire
,
at
the
very
reasonable
rate
of
seven
-
and
-
twenty
shillings
and
sixpence
per
week
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
is
there
anything
more
we
can
do
for
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Roker
,
looking
round
with
great
satisfaction
,
and
gaily
chinking
the
first
week
's
hire
in
his
closed
fist
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
had
been
musing
deeply
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
there
any
people
here
who
run
on
errands
,
and
so
forth
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Outside
,
do
you
mean
?
"
inquired
Mr
Roker
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
who
are
able
to
go
outside
.
 
<EOS>
Not
prisoners
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
there
is
,
"
said
Roker
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
an
unfortunate
devil
,
who
has
got
a
friend
on
the
poor
side
,
that
's
glad
to
do
anything
of
that
sort
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
been
running
odd
jobs
,
and
that
,
for
the
last
two
months
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
send
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
;
no
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
side
,
you
say
?
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
to
him
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
poor
side
of
a
debtor
's
prison
is
,
as
its
name
imports
,
that
in
which
the
most
miserable
and
abject
class
of
debtors
are
confined
.
 
<EOS>
A
prisoner
having
declared
upon
the
poor
side
,
pays
neither
rent
nor
chummage
.
 
<EOS>
His
fees
,
upon
entering
and
leaving
the
jail
,
are
reduced
in
amount
,
and
he
becomes
entitled
to
a
share
of
some
small
quantities
of
food
:
to
provide
which
,
a
few
charitable
persons
have
,
from
time
to
time
,
left
trifling
legacies
in
their
wills
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
our
readers
will
remember
,
that
,
until
within
a
very
few
years
past
,
there
was
a
kind
of
iron
cage
in
the
wall
of
the
Fleet
Prison
,
within
which
was
posted
some
man
of
hungry
looks
,
who
,
from
time
to
time
,
rattled
a
money
-
box
,
and
exclaimed
in
a
mournful
voice
,
"
Pray
,
remember
the
poor
debtors
;
pray
remember
the
poor
debtors
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
receipts
of
this
box
,
when
there
were
any
,
were
divided
among
the
poor
prisoners
;
and
the
men
on
the
poor
side
relieved
each
other
in
this
degrading
office
.
   
<EOS>
Although
this
custom
has
been
abolished
,
and
the
cage
is
now
boarded
up
,
the
miserable
and
destitute
condition
of
these
unhappy
persons
remains
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
We
no
longer
suffer
them
to
appeal
at
the
prison
gates
to
the
charity
and
compassion
of
the
passersby
;
but
we
still
leave
unblotted
the
leaves
of
our
statute
book
,
for
the
reverence
and
admiration
of
succeeding
ages
,
the
just
and
wholesome
law
which
declares
that
the
sturdy
felon
shall
be
fed
and
clothed
,
and
that
the
penniless
debtor
shall
be
left
to
die
of
starvation
and
nakedness
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
no
fiction
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
week
passes
over
our
head
,
but
,
in
every
one
of
our
prisons
for
debt
,
some
of
these
men
must
inevitably
expire
in
the
slow
agonies
of
want
,
if
they
were
not
relieved
by
their
fellow
-
prisoners
.
   
<EOS>
Turning
these
things
in
his
mind
,
as
he
mounted
the
narrow
staircase
at
the
foot
of
which
Roker
had
left
him
,
Mr
Pickwick
gradually
worked
himself
to
the
boiling
-
over
point
;
and
so
excited
was
he
with
his
reflections
on
this
subject
,
that
he
had
burst
into
the
room
to
which
he
had
been
directed
,
before
he
had
any
distinct
recollection
,
either
of
the
place
in
which
he
was
,
or
of
the
object
of
his
visit
.
   
<EOS>
The
general
aspect
of
the
room
recalled
him
to
himself
at
once
;
but
he
had
no
sooner
cast
his
eye
on
the
figure
of
a
man
who
was
brooding
over
the
dusty
fire
,
than
,
letting
his
hat
fall
on
the
floor
,
he
stood
perfectly
fixed
and
immovable
with
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
Yes
;
in
tattered
garments
,
and
without
a
coat
;
his
common
calico
shirt
,
yellow
and
in
rags
;
his
hair
hanging
over
his
face
;
his
features
changed
with
suffering
,
and
pinched
with
famine
---
there
sat
Mr
Alfred
Jingle
;
his
head
resting
on
his
hands
,
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
fire
,
and
his
whole
appearance
denoting
misery
and
dejection
!
   
<EOS>
Near
him
,
leaning
listlessly
against
the
wall
,
stood
a
strong
-
built
countryman
,
flicking
with
a
worn
-
out
hunting
-
whip
the
top
-
boot
that
adorned
his
right
foot
;
his
left
being
thrust
into
an
old
slipper
.
 
<EOS>
Horses
,
dogs
,
and
drink
had
brought
him
there
,
pell
-
mell
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
rusty
spur
on
the
solitary
boot
,
which
he
occasionally
jerked
into
the
empty
air
,
at
the
same
time
giving
the
boot
a
smart
blow
,
and
muttering
some
of
the
sounds
by
which
a
sportsman
encourages
his
horse
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
riding
,
in
imagination
,
some
desperate
steeplechase
at
that
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
wretch
!
 
<EOS>
He
never
rode
a
match
on
the
swiftest
animal
in
his
costly
stud
,
with
half
the
speed
at
which
he
had
torn
along
the
course
that
ended
in
the
Fleet
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
an
old
man
was
seated
on
a
small
wooden
box
,
with
his
eyes
riveted
on
the
floor
,
and
his
face
settled
into
an
expression
of
the
deepest
and
most
hopeless
despair
.
 
<EOS>
A
young
girl
---
his
little
grand
-
daughter
---
was
hanging
about
him
,
endeavouring
,
with
a
thousand
childish
devices
,
to
engage
his
attention
;
but
the
old
man
neither
saw
nor
heard
her
.
<EOS>
The
voice
that
had
been
music
to
him
,
and
the
eyes
that
had
been
light
,
fell
coldly
on
his
senses
.
 
<EOS>
His
limbs
were
shaking
with
disease
,
and
the
palsy
had
fastened
on
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
two
or
three
other
men
in
the
room
,
congregated
in
a
little
knot
,
and
noiselessly
talking
among
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
lean
and
haggard
woman
,
too
---
<EOS>
a
prisoner
's
wife
---
who
was
watering
,
with
great
solicitude
,
the
wretched
stump
of
a
dried
-
up
,
withered
plant
,
which
,
it
was
plain
to
see
,
could
never
send
forth
a
green
leaf
again
---
too
true
an
emblem
,
perhaps
,
of
the
office
she
had
come
there
to
discharge
.
   
<EOS>
Such
were
the
objects
which
presented
themselves
to
Mr
Pickwick
's
view
,
as
he
looked
round
him
in
amazement
.
 
<EOS>
The
noise
of
some
one
stumbling
hastily
into
the
room
,
roused
him
.
<EOS>
Turning
his
eyes
towards
the
door
,
they
encountered
the
new
-
comer
;
and
in
him
,
through
his
rags
and
dirt
,
he
recognised
the
familiar
features
of
Mr
Job
Trotter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pickwick
!
"
exclaimed
Job
aloud
.
   
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
"
said
Jingle
,
starting
from
his
seat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
 
---
!
 
<EOS>
So
it
is
---
<EOS>
queer
place
---
strange
things
---
serves
me
right
---
very
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jingle
thrust
his
hands
into
the
place
where
his
trousers
pockets
used
to
be
,
and
,
dropping
his
chin
upon
his
breast
,
sank
back
into
his
chair
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
affected
;
the
two
men
looked
so
very
miserable
.
<EOS>
The
sharp
,
involuntary
glance
Jingle
had
cast
at
a
small
piece
of
raw
loin
of
mutton
,
which
Job
had
brought
in
with
him
,
said
more
of
their
reduced
state
than
two
hours
"
explanation
could
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
looked
mildly
at
Jingle
,
and
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
speak
to
you
in
private
.
 
<EOS>
Will

Jingle
delivered
this
singular
summary
of
his
prospects
in
life
,
with
his
accustomed
volubility
,
and
with
various
twitches
of
the
countenance
to
counterfeit
smiles
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
easily
perceived
that
his
recklessness
was
assumed
,
and
looking
him
full
,
but
not
unkindly
,
in
the
face
,
saw
that
his
eyes
were
moist
with
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
fellow

said
Jingle
,
pressing
his
hand
,
and
turning
his

away

<EOS>
Wholly
unable
to
keep
up
appearances
any
longer
,
and
perhaps
rendered
worse
by
the
effort
he
had
made
,
the
dejected
stroller
sat
down
on
the
stairs
,
and
,
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
,
sobbed
like
a
child
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
considerable
emotion
,
"
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
,
when
I
know
all
about
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Here
,
Job
;
where
is
that
fellow
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
,
sir
,
"
replied
Job
,
presenting
himself
on
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
described
him
,
by
the
bye
,
as
having
deeply
-
sunken
eyes
,
in
the
best
of
times
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
present
state
of
want
and
distress
,
he
looked
as
if
those
features
had
gone
out
of
town
altogether
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
,
sir
,
"
cried
Job
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
here
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
trying
to
look
stern
,
with
four
large
tears
running
down
his
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
that
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Take
what
?
 
<EOS>
In
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
such
language
,
it
should
have
been
a
blow
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
world
runs
,
it
ought
to
have
been
a
sound
,
hearty
cuff
;
for
Mr
Pickwick
had
been
duped
,
deceived
,
and
wronged
by
the
destitute
outcast
who
was
now
wholly
in
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
Must
we
tell
the
truth
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
something
from
Mr
Pickwick
's
waistcoat
pocket
,
which
chinked
as
it
was
given
into
Job
's
hand
,
and
the
giving
of
which
,
somehow
or
other
imparted
a
sparkle
to
the
eye
,
and
a
swelling
to
the
heart
,
of
our
excellent
old
friend
,
as
he
hurried
away
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
had
returned
when
Mr
Pickwick
reached
his
own
room
,
and
was
inspecting
the
arrangements
that
had
been
made
for
his
comfort
,
with
a
kind
of
grim
satisfaction
which
was
very
pleasant
to
look
upon
.
 
<EOS>
Having
a
decided
objection
to
his
master
's
being
there
at
all
,
Mr
Weller
appeared
to
consider
it
a
high
moral
duty
not
to
appear
too
much
pleased
with
anything
that
was
done
,
said
,
suggested
,
or
proposed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well

"
replied
Mr

.
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty

"
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty

"
responded
Sam
,
looking
round
him
in
a
disparaging
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
seen
Mr
Tupman
and
our
other
friends
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes

replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
brought
the
things
I
wanted
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
in
reply
pointed
to
various
packages
which
he
had
arranged
,
as
neatly
as
he
could
,
in
a
corner
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
after
a
little
hesitation
;
"
listen
to
what
I
am
going
to
say
,
Sam
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cert'nly

Sir
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Weller
;
"
fire
away
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
felt
from
the
first
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
much
solemnity
,
"
that
this
is
not
the
place
to
bring
a
young
man
to
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
an
old
'
un
<EOS>
neither
,
Sir

"
observed
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
quite
right
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
but
old
men
may
come
here
through
their
own
heedlessness
and
unsuspicion
,
and
young
men
may
be
brought
here
by
the
selfishness
of
those
they
serve
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
better
for
those
young
men
,
in
every
point
of
view
,
that
they
should
not
remain
here
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
me
,
Sam
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Vy
<EOS>
no

Sir

I

NOT

replied
Mr
Weller
doggedly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Try

said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Vell

"
rejoined
Sam
,
after
a
short
pause
,
"
I
think
I
see

ven

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
comprehend
me
,
Sam

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Independently
of
my
wish
that
you
should
not
be
idling
about
a
place
like
this
,
for
years
to
come
,
I
feel
that
for
a
debtor
in
the
Fleet
to
be
attended
by
his
manservant
is
a
monstrous
absurdity
.
 
<EOS>
Sam

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
for
a

you
must
leave
me

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

rejoined
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
rather
sarcastically
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
for
the
time
that
I
remain
here

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
"
Your
wages
I
shall
continue
to

<EOS>
Any
one
of
my
three
friends
will
be
happy
to
take
you
,
were
it
only
out
of
respect
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
I
ever
do
leave
this
place
,
Sam
,
"
added
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
assumed
cheerfulness
---
"
<EOS>
if
I
do
,
I
pledge
you
my
word
that
you
shall
return
to
me
instantly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
I
'll
tell
you
wot
<EOS>
it
is
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
in
a
grave
and
solemn
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
This

<EOS>
"
I

said
Mr

.
   
<EOS>
"

inquired
Mr
Weller
firmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wery

then

"
   
<EOS>
Thus
speaking
,
Mr
Weller
fixed
his
hat
on
his
head
with
great
precision
,
and
abruptly
left
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam

"
cried
Mr
Pickwick
,
calling
after
him
,
"
Sam

Here

<EOS>
But
the
long
gallery
ceased
to
re

echo
the
sound
of
footsteps

Sam
Weller
was
gone

<EOS>
Showing
how
Mr
Samuel
Weller
got
into
difficulties
 
<EOS>
In
a
lofty
room
,
ill
-
lighted
and
worse
ventilated
,
situated
in
Portugal
Street
,
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
,
there
sit
<EOS>
nearly
the
whole
year
round
,
one
,
two
,
three
,
or
four
gentlemen
in
wigs
,
as
the
case
may
be
,
with
little
writing
-
desks
before
them
,
constructed
after
the
fashion
of
those
used
by
the
judges
of
the
land
,
barring
the
French
polish
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
box
of
barristers
on
their
right
hand
;
there
is
an
enclosure
of
insolvent
debtors
on
their
left
;
and
there
is
an
inclined
plane
of
most
especially
dirty
faces
in
their
front
.
 
<EOS>
These
gentlemen
are
the
Commissioners
of
the
Insolvent
Court
,
and
the
place
in
which
they
sit
,
is
the
Insolvent
Court
itself
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
,
and
has
been
,
time
out
of
mind
,
the
remarkable
fate
of
this
court
to
be
,
somehow
or
other
,
held
and
understood
,
by
the
general
consent
of
all
the
destitute
shabby
-
genteel
people
in
London
,
as
their
common
resort
,
and
place
of
daily
refuge
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
always
full
.
 
<EOS>
The
steams
of
beer
and
spirits
perpetually
ascend
to
the
ceiling
,
and
,
being
condensed
by
the
heat
,
roll
down
the
walls
like
rain
;
there
are
more
old
suits
of
clothes
in
it
at
one
time
,
than
will
be
offered
for
sale
in
all
Houndsditch
in
a
twelvemonth
;
more
unwashed
skins
and
grizzly
beards
than
all
the
pumps
and
shaving
-
shops
between
Tyburn
and
Whitechapel
could
render
decent
,
between
sunrise
and
sunset
.
   
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
supposed
that
any
of
these
people
have
the
least
shadow
of
business
in
,
or
the
remotest
connection
with
,
the
place
they
so
indefatigably
attend
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
had
,
it
would
be
no
matter
of
surprise
,
and
the
singularity
of
the
thing
would
cease
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
them
sleep
during
the
greater
part
of
the
sitting
;
others
carry
small
portable
dinners
wrapped
in
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
or
sticking
out
of
their
worn
-
out
pockets
,
and
munch
and
listen
with
equal
relish
;
but
no
one
among
them
was
ever
known
to
have
the
slightest
personal
interest
in
any
case
that
was
ever
brought
forward
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
they
do
,
there
they
sit
from
the
first
moment
to
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
is
heavy
,
rainy
weather
,
they
all
come
in
,
wet
through
;
and
at
such
times
the
vapours
of
the
court
are
like
those
of
a
fungus
-
pit
.
   
<EOS>
A
casual
visitor
might
suppose
this
place
to
be
a
temple
dedicated
to
the
Genius
of
Seediness
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
messenger
or
process
-
server
attached
to
it
,
who
wears
a
coat
that
was
made
for
him
;
not
a
tolerably
fresh
,
or
wholesome
-
looking
man
in
the
whole
establishment
,
except
a
little
white
-
headed
apple
-
faced
tipstaff
,
and
even
he
,
like
an
ill
-
conditioned
cherry
preserved
in
brandy
,
seems
to
have
artificially
dried
and
withered
up
into
a
state
of
preservation
to
which
he
can
lay
no
natural
claim
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
barristers
"
<EOS>
wigs
are
ill
-
powdered
,
and
their
curls
lack
crispness
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
attorneys
,
who
sit
at
a
large
bare
table
below
the
commissioners
,
are
,
after
all
,
the
greatest
curiosities
.
 
<EOS>
The
professional
establishment
of
the
more
opulent
of
these
gentlemen
,
consists
of
a
blue
bag
and
a
boy
;
generally
a
youth
of
the
Jewish
persuasion
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
fixed
offices
,
their
legal
business
being
transacted
in
the
parlours
of
public
-
houses
,
or
the
yards
of
prisons
,
whither
they
repair
in
crowds
,
and
canvass
for
customers
after
the
manner
of
omnibus
cads
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
of
a
greasy
and
mildewed
appearance
;
and
if
they
can
be
said
to
have
any
vices
at
all
,
perhaps
drinking
and
cheating
are
the
most
conspicuous
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
Their
residences
are
usually
on
the
outskirts
of
"
the
Rules
,
"
chiefly
lying
within
a
circle
of
one
mile
from
the
obelisk
in
St
George
's
Fields
.
 
<EOS>
Their
looks
are
not
prepossessing
,
and
their
manners
are
peculiar
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Solomon
Pell
,
one
of
this
learned
body
,
was
a
fat
,
flabby
,
pale
man
,
in
a
surtout
which
looked
green
one
minute
,
and
brown
the
next
,
with
a
velvet
collar
of
the
same
chameleon
tints
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
was
narrow

his
face
wide

his
head
large

with
the
propensities
she
observed
in
him
in
his
birth
,
had
given
it
an
angry
tweak
which
it
had
never
recovered
.
 
<EOS>
Being
short
-
necked
and
asthmatic
,
however
,
he
respired
principally
through
this
feature
;
so
,
perhaps
,
what
it
wanted
in
ornament
,
it
made
up
in
usefulness
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
to
bring
him
through
it
,
"
said
Mr
Pell
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
,
though
?
"
<EOS>
replied
the
person
to
whom
the
assurance
was
pledged
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Certain
sure
,
"
replied
Pell
;
"
but
if
he
'd
gone
to
any
irregular
practitioner
,
mind
you
,
I
would
n't
have
answered
for
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
other
,
with
open
mouth
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
that
I
would
n't
,
"
said
Mr
Pell
;
and
he
pursed
up
his
lips
,
frowned
,
and
shook
his
head
mysteriously
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
the
place
where
this
discourse
occurred
was
the
public
-
house
just
opposite
to
the
Insolvent
Court
;
and
the
person
with
whom
it
was
held
was
no
other
than
the
elder
Mr
Weller
,
who
had
come
there
,
to
comfort
and
console
a
friend
,
whose
petition
to
be
discharged
under
the
act
,
was
to
be
that
day
heard
,
and
whose
attorney
he
was
at
that
moment
consulting
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
vere
is
George
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pell
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
a
back
parlour
,
whither
Mr
Weller
at
once
repairing
,
was
immediately
greeted
in
the
warmest
and
most
flattering
manner
by
some
half
-
dozen
of
his
professional
brethren
,
in
token
of
their
gratification
at
his
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
The
insolvent
gentleman
,
who
had
contracted
a
speculative
but
imprudent
passion
for
horsing
long
stages
,
which
had
led
to
his
present
embarrassments
,
looked
extremely
well
,
and
was
soothing
the
excitement
of
his
feelings
with
shrimps
and
porter
.
   
<EOS>
The
salutation
between
Mr
Weller
and
his
friends
was
strictly
confined
to
the
freemasonry
of
the
craft
;
consisting
of
a
jerking
round
of
the
right
wrist
,
and
a
tossing
of
the
little
finger
into
the
air
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
We
once
knew
two
famous
coachmen
(
they
are
dead
now
,
poor
fellows
)
who
were
twins
,
and
between
whom
an
unaffected
and
devoted
attachment
existed
.
 
<EOS>
They
passed
each
other
on
the
Dover
road
,
every
day
,
for
twenty
-
four
years
,
never
exchanging
any
other
greeting
than
this
;
and
yet
,
when
one
died
,
the
other
pined
away
,
and
soon
afterwards
followed
him
!
   
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
George
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
senior
,
taking
off
his
upper
coat
,
and
seating
himself
with
his
accustomed
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
is
it
?
<EOS>
All
right
behind
,
and
full
inside
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
old
feller
,
"
replied
the
embarrassed
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
the
gray
mare
made
over
to
anybody
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Weller
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
George
nodded
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
that
's
all
right
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
Coach
taken
care
on
,
also
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Con
-
signed
in
a
safe
quarter
,
"
replied
George
,
wringing
the
heads
off
half
a
dozen
shrimps
,
and
swallowing
them
without
any
more
ado
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
good
,
wery
good
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alvays
see

the
drag
<EOS>
ven
you
go
downhill
.
 
<EOS>
Is
the
vay
-
bill
all
clear
and
straight
for'erd
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
schedule
,
sir
,
"
said
Pell
,
<EOS>
guessing
at
Mr
Weller
's
meaning
,
"
the
schedule
is
as
plain
and
satisfactory
as
pen
and
ink
can
make
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
nodded
in
a
manner
which
bespoke
his
inward
approval
of
these
arrangements
;
and
then
,
turning
to
Mr
Pell
,
said
,
pointing
to
his
friend
George
---
   
<EOS>
"
Ven
do
you
take
his
cloths
off
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
replied
Mr
Pell
,
"
he
stands
third
on
the
opposed
list
,
and
I
should
think
it
would
be
his
turn
in
about
half
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
my
clerk
to
come
over
and
tell
us
when
there
was
a
chance
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
surveyed
the
attorney
from
head
to
foot
with
great
admiration
,
and
said
emphatically
---
   
"
<EOS>
And
what
'll
you
take
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
really
,
"
replied
Mr
Pell
,
"
<EOS>
you
're
very
---
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
and
honour
,
I
'm
not
in
the

It
's
so
very
early
in
the
morning
,
that
,
actually
,
I
am
almost
---
 
<EOS>
Well
,
you
may
bring
me
threepenn'orth
of
rum
,
my

"
   
<EOS>
The
officiating
damsel
,
who
had
anticipated
the
order
before
it
was
given
,
set
the
glass
of
spirits
before
Pell
,
and
retired
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
said
Mr
Pell
,
looking
round
upon
the
company
,
"
success
to
your
friend
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
to
boast
,
gentlemen
;
it
's
not
my
way
;
but
I
ca
n't
help
saying
,
that
,
if
your
friend
had
n't
been
fortunate
enough
to
fall
into
hands
that
---
 
<EOS>
But
I
wo
n't
say
what
I
was
going
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
my
service
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Having
emptied
the
glass
in
a
twinkling
,
Mr
Pell
smacked
his
lips
,
and
looked
complacently
round
on
the
assembled
coachmen
,
who
evidently
regarded
him
as
a
species
of
divinity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
,
"
said
the
legal
authority
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
was
I
a
-
saying
,
gentlemen
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
was
remarkin
'
as
you
would
n't
have
no
objection
to
another
o

<EOS>
the
same
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
with
grave
facetiousness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
"
laughed
Mr
Pell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
bad
,
not
bad
.
 
<EOS>
A
professional
man
,
too
!
 
<EOS>
At
this
time
of
the
morning
,
it
would
be
rather
too
good
a
---
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
my
dear
<EOS>
---
you
may
do
that
again
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
Hem
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
last
sound
was
a
solemn
and
dignified
cough
,
in
which
Mr
Pell
,
observing
an
indecent
tendency
to
mirth
in
some
of
his
auditors
,
considered
it
due
to
himself
to
indulge
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
late
Lord
Chancellor
,
gentlemen
,
was
very
fond
of
me
,
"
said
Mr
Pell
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
wery
creditable
in
him
,
too
,
"
interposed
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hear
,
hear
,
"
assented
Mr
Pell
's
client
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
should
n't
he
be
?
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
indeed
!
"
said
a
very
red
-
faced
man
,
who
had
said
nothing
yet
,
and
who
looked
extremely
unlikely
to
say
anything
more
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
should
n't
he
?
"
   
A
murmur
of
assent
ran
through
the
company
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
remember
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Mr
Pell
,
"
dining
with
him
on
one
occasion
;
there
was
only
us
two
,
but
everything
as
splendid
as
if
twenty
people
had
been
expected
---
the
great
seal
on
a
dumb
-
waiter
at
his
right
hand
,
and
a
man
in
a
bag
-
wig
and
suit
of
armour
guarding
the
mace
with
a
drawn
sword
and
silk
stockings
 
---
which
is
perpetually
done
,
gentlemen
,
night
and
day
;
when
he
said
,
"
Pell
,
"
he
said
,
"
no
false
delicacy
,
Pell
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
man
of
talent
;
you
can
get
anybody
through
the
Insolvent
Court
,
Pell
;
and
your
country
should
be
proud
of
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Those
were
his
very
words
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
Lord
,
"
I
said
,
"
you
flatter
me
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
Pell
,
"
he
said
,
"
if
I
do
,
I
'm
damned
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
Did
he
say
that
?
"
inquired
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
did
,
"
replied
Pell
.
   
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
then
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
"
I
say
Parliament
ought
to
ha
'
took
it
up
;
and
if
he
'd
been
a
poor
man
,
they
would
ha
'
done
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
friend
,
"
argued
Mr
Pell
,
"
it
was
in
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
what
?
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
confidence
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
wery
good
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
,
after
a
little
reflection
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
damned
hisself
in
confidence
,
o
'
course
that
was
another
thing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
was
,
"
said
Mr
Pell
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
distinction
's
obvious
,
you
will
perceive
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Alters
the
case
entirely
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
Sir
.
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
will
not
go
on
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pell
,
in
a
low
and
serious
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
reminded
me
,
Sir
,
that
this
conversation
was
private
---
private
and
confidential
,
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
I
am
a
professional
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
I
am
a
good
deal
looked
up
to
,
in
my
profession
<EOS>
---
it
may
be
that
I
am
not
.
 
<EOS>
Most
people
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Observations
have
already
been
made
,
in
this
room
,
injurious
to
the
reputation
of
my
noble
friend
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
excuse
me
,
gentlemen
;
I
was
imprudent
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
have
no
right
to
mention
this
matter
without
his
concurrence
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
Sir
;
thank
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
delivering
himself
,
Mr
Pell
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
and
,
frowning
grimly
around
,
rattled
three
halfpence
with
terrible
determination
.
   
<EOS>
This
virtuous
resolution
had
scarcely
been
formed
,
when
the
boy
and
the
blue
bag
,
who
were
inseparable
companions
,
rushed
violently
into
the
room
,
and
said
(
at
least
the
boy
did
,
for
the
blue
bag
took
no
part
in
the
announcement
)
that
the
case
was
coming
on
directly
.
 
<EOS>
The
intelligence
was
no
sooner
received
than
the
whole
party
hurried
across
the
street
,
and
began
to
fight
their
way
into
court
---
a
preparatory
ceremony
,
which
has
been
calculated
to
occupy
,
in
ordinary
cases
,
from
twenty
-
five
minutes
to
thirty
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
,
being
stout
,
cast
himself
at
once
into
the
crowd
,
with
the
desperate
hope
of
ultimately
turning
up
in
some
place
which
would
suit
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
success
was
not
quite
equal
to
his
expectations
;
for
having
neglected
to
take
his
hat
off
,
it
was
knocked
over
his
eyes
by
some
unseen
person
,
upon
whose
toes
he
had
alighted
with
considerable
force
.
 
<EOS>
Apparently
this
individual
regretted
his
impetuosity
immediately
afterwards
,
for
,
muttering
an
indistinct
exclamation
of
surprise
,
he
dragged
the
old
man
out
into
the
hall
,
and
,
after
a
violent
struggle
,
released
his
head
and
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Samivel
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Weller
,
when
he
was
thus
enabled
to
behold
his
rescuer
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
nodded
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
dutiful
and
affectionate
little
boy
,
you
are
,

"
said
Mr
Weller
,
"
to
come

his
old
age

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How

"
responded
the
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do

"
   
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
that
's

replied
Mr
Weller
,
mollified
at
once
;
"
but

<EOS>

<EOS>
,
they

"
 
<EOS>
And
Mr
Weller
shook
his
head
with
legal
solemnity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
a
perwerse
old
file
it
is

"
exclaimed
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
always

and
that

<EOS>
Who
said
anything
about
the
werdick
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
made
no
reply
,
but
once
more
shook
his
head
most
learnedly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Leave
off

ere

if
you
do
n't
want

said
Sam
impatiently
,
"
and
behave
reasonable
.
 
<EOS>
I
vent

Markis

"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
see
the
Marchioness
o

Granby
,
Sammy
?
"
inquired
Mr
Weller
,
with
a
sigh
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
did
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
How

"
   
"
Wery

said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
that
,
Sammy
?
"
said
the
senior
earnestly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
indeed
,
"
replied
the
junior
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
seized
his
son
's
hand
,
clasped
it
,
and
let
it
fall
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
expression
on
his
countenance
in
doing
so
---
not
of
dismay
or
apprehension
,
but
partaking
more
of
the
sweet
and
gentle
character
of
hope
.
 
<EOS>
A
gleam
of
resignation
,
and
even
of
cheerfulness
,
passed
over
his
face
too
,
as
he
slowly
said
,
"
I
ai
n't
quite
certain
,
Sammy
;
I
would
n't
like
to
say
I
wos
altogether
positive
,
in
case
of
any
subsekent
disappointment
,
but
I
rayther
think
,
my
boy
,
I
rayther
think
,
that
the
shepherd
's
got
the
liver
complaint
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
he
look
bad
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
uncommon
pale
,
"
replied
his
father
,
"
'
<EOS>
cept
about
the
nose
,
which
is
redder
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
His
appetite
is
wery
so
-
so
,
but
he
imbibes
wonderful
.
"
   
<EOS>
Some
thoughts
of
the
rum
appeared
to
obtrude
themselves
on
Mr
Weller
's
mind
,
as
he
said
this
;
for
he
looked
gloomy
and
thoughtful
;
but
he
very
shortly
recovered
,
as
was
testified
by
a
perfect
alphabet
of
winks
,
in
which
he
was
only
wo
nt
to
indulge
when
particularly
pleased
.
   
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
now
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
about
my
affair
.
 
<EOS>
Just
open
them
ears
o
'
yourn
,
and
do
n't
say
nothin'
till
I
've
done
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
preface
,
Sam
related
,
as
succinctly
as
he
could
,
the
last
memorable
conversation
he
had
had
with
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
there
by
himself
,
poor
creetur
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
elder
Mr
Weller
,
"
without
nobody
to
take
his
part
!
 
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
be
done
,
Samivel
,
it
ca
n't
be
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
'
course
it
ca
n't
,
"
asserted
Sam
:
"
<EOS>
I
know'd
<EOS>
that
,
afore
I
came
.
"
<EOS>
"
Why
,
they
'll
eat
him
up
alive
,
Sammy
,
"
exclaimed
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
nodded
his
concurrence
in
the
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
goes
in
rayther
raw
,
Sammy
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
metaphorically
,
"
and
he
'll
come
out
,
done
<EOS>
so
ex

ceedin
'
brown
,
that
his
most

<EOS>
Roast

nothin'

Sammy

"
   
<EOS>
Again
Sam
Weller
nodded
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
ought
n't
to
be
,
Samivel
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
gravely
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
must
n't
be

"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cert'nly
not

"
said
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Vell

"
said
Sam
,
"
you

<EOS>
"
Who

"
inquired
Mr

.
   
<EOS>
"
Never

"
retorted
Sam
;
"
he
warn't
<EOS>

that

for
you

"
<EOS>
"
I
know'd
a

<EOS>

"
said
Mr

,
musing
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
warn't
him

"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
This

"
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
's
a

"
inquired
Mr

,
looking
sternly
on
his
son
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wy

"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I

know'd
him
,
Sammy

"
said
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
P'raps
he
might

throw'd
<EOS>
a

Hows'ever

an

<EOS>
Go

"
said
Mr

,
with
a
sigh
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well

"
said
Sam
,
"
<EOS>
you

Do

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No

I
do

said
Mr

,
with
a
reflective
visage
.
   
<EOS>
"
No

"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
No

"
said
Mr
Weller
,
"
unless
"
---
and
a
gleam
of
intelligence
lighted
up
his
countenance
as
he
sank
his
voice
to
a
whisper
,
and
applied
his
mouth
to
the
ear
of
his
offspring
---
"
unless
it
is
getting
him
out
in
a
turn
-
up
bedstead
,
unbeknown

or
dressin

him
up

a

"
ooman
vith

green
wail

"
   
<EOS>
Sam
Weller
received
both
of
these
suggestions
with
unexpected
contempt
,
and
again
propounded
his
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
;
"
if
he
von't
let
you
stop
there
<EOS>
,
I
see
no

at

.
 
<EOS>
It
's
no

Sammy
,
no
thoroughfare

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
I
'll
tell
you
wot
<EOS>
it
is
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
I
'll
trouble
you
for
the
loan
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
pound
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
good'll
that
do
?
"
inquired
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
P'raps
you
may
ask
for
it
five
minits
arterwards
;
<EOS>
p'raps
I
may
say
I
von't

<EOS>
You

you

you
unnat'ral
wagabone
?
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
reply
of
Sam
's
,
the
father
and
son
exchanged
a
complete
code
of
telegraph
nods
and
gestures
,
after
which
,
the
elder
Mr
Weller
sat
himself
down
on
a
stone
step
and
laughed
till
he
was
purple
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
a
old
image
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Sam
,
indignant
at
this
loss
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
a
-
settin
'
down
there
for

con

Where

"
<EOS>
"
In

Sammy
,
in
the
boot

"
replied
Mr
Weller
,
composing
his
features
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
my
hat
,
Sammy
.
"
   
<EOS>
Having
divested
himself
of
this
encumbrance
,
Mr
Weller
gave
his
body
a
sudden
wrench
to
one
side
,
and
by
a
dexterous
twist
,
contrived
to
get
his
right
hand
into
a
most
capacious
pocket
,
from
whence
,
after
a
great
deal
of
panting
and
exertion
,
he
extricated
a
pocket
-
book
of
the
large
octavo
size
,
fastened
by
a
huge
leathern
strap
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
ledger
he
drew
forth
a
couple
of
whiplashes
,
three
or
four
buckles
,
a
little
sample
-
bag
of
corn
,
and
,
finally
,
a
small
roll
of
very
dirty
bank
-
notes
,
from
which
he
selected
the
required
amount
,
which
he
handed
over
to
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
Sammy
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
when
the
whip
-
lashes
,
and
the
buckles
,
and
the
samples
,
had
been
all
put
back
,
and
the
book
once
more
deposited
at
the
bottom
of
the
same
pocket
,
"
<EOS>
now

Sammy

I

<EOS>

<EOS>
"

Well

"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr

.
   
<EOS>
"
Just

"
said
Sam
,
"
that
I

<EOS>
No

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Deferring
to
his
son
's
feeling
upon
this
point
,
Mr
Weller
at
once
sought
the
erudite
Solomon
Pell
,
and
acquainted
him
with
his
desire
to
issue
a
writ
,
instantly
,
for
the
SUM
of
twenty
-
five
pounds
,
and
costs
of
process
;
to
be
executed
without
delay
upon
the
body
of
one
Samuel
Weller
;
the
charges
thereby
incurred
,
to
be
paid
in
advance
to
Solomon
Pell
.
   
<EOS>
The
attorney
was
in
high
glee
,
for
the
embarrassed
coach
-
horser
was
ordered
to
be
discharged
forthwith
.
 
<EOS>
He
highly
approved
of
Sam
's
attachment
to
his
master
;
declared
that
it
strongly
reminded
him
of
his
own
feelings
of
devotion
to
his
friend
,
the
Chancellor
;
and
at
once
led
the
elder
Mr
Weller
down
to
the
Temple
,
to
swear
the
affidavit
of
debt
,
which
the
boy
,
with
the
assistance
of
the
blue
bag
,
had
drawn
up
on
the
spot
.
   
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Sam
,
having
been
formally
introduced
to
the
whitewashed
gentleman
and
his
friends
,
as
the
offspring
of
Mr
Weller
,
of
the
Belle
Savage
,
was
treated
with
marked
distinction
,
and
invited
to
regale
himself
with
them
in
honour
of
the
occasion
 
---
an
invitation
which
he
was
by
no
means
backward
in
accepting
.
   
<EOS>
The
mirth
of
gentlemen
of
this
class
is
of
a
grave
and
quiet
character
,
usually
;
but
the
present
instance
was
one
of
peculiar
festivity
,
and
they
relaxed
in
proportion
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
rather
tumultuous
toasting
of
the
Chief
Commissioner
and
Mr
Solomon
Pell
,
who
had
that
day
displayed
such
transcendent
abilities
,
a
mottled
-
faced
gentleman
in
a
blue
shawl
proposed
that
somebody
should
sing
a
song
.
 
<EOS>
The
obvious
suggestion
was
,
that
the
mottled
-
faced
gentleman
,
being
anxious
for
a
song
,
should
sing
it
himself
;
but
this
the
mottled
-
faced
gentleman
sturdily
,
and
somewhat
offensively
,
declined
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
as
is
not
unusual
in
such
cases
,
a
rather
angry
colloquy
ensued
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
said
the
coach
-
horser
,
"
rather
than
disturb
the
harmony
of
this
delightful
occasion
,
perhaps
Mr
Samuel
Weller
will
oblige
the
company
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Raly
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
I
'm
not
wery
much
in
the
habit
o
'
singin
'
without
the
instrument
;
but
anythin
'
for
a
quiet
life
,
as
the
man
said
wen
he
took
the
sitivation
at
the
lighthouse
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
prelude
,
Mr
Samuel
Weller
burst
at
once
into
the
following
wild
and
beautiful
legend
,
which
,
under
the
impression
that
it
is
not
generally
known
,
we
take
the
liberty
of
quoting
.
 
<EOS>
We
would
beg
to
call
particular
attention
to
the
monosyllable
at
the
end
of
the
second
and
fourth
lines
,
which
not
only
enables
the
singer
to
take
breath
at
those
points
,
but
greatly
assists
the
metre
.

ROMANCE

I^
   
<EOS>
Bold
Turpin

on
Hounslow

His
bold
mare

he
see'd

coming
along

<EOS>
So
he
gallops
close
to
the

And
he
claps
his
head
vithin
;
And
the
Bishop
says
,
"
Sure

This
here
's

Turpin

"
You

So
he
puts

<EOS>
As
the
mottled
-
faced
gentleman
spoke
with
great
energy
and
determination
,
and
as
the
opinions
of
the
company
seemed
divided
on
the
subject
,
it
threatened
to
give
rise
to
fresh
altercation
,
when
Mr
Weller
and
Mr
Pell
most
opportunely
arrived
.
   
<EOS>
"
All

said
Mr

.
   
<EOS>
"
The

Mr

Sam

with

broad
grin

<EOS>

Not

said
the
elder
Mr

.
   
<EOS>
"
Do

said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not

replied
the
inexorable
creditor
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
give

for

said
Mr

was
making
out
his

amusing

<EOS>
And
Mr
Pell
smiled
again
,
as
he
called
Mr
Weller
's
attention
to
the
amount
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,

"
said
the
professional
gentleman
,
taking
up
another
of
the
greasy
notes
as
Mr
Weller
took
it
from
the
pocket
-
book
.
 
<EOS>
"

added
Mr
Pell
,
smiling
smoothly
round
,
as
he
buttoned
up
the
money
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot

said
the

Mr

,
with
a
chuckle

<EOS>
"
Prodigal

suggested
Mr

,
mildly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never

said
Mr

,
with
dignity

"
   
<EOS>
By
the
time
the
officer
arrived
,
Sam
had
made
himself
so
extremely
popular
,
that
the
congregated
gentlemen
determined
to
see
him
to
prison
in
a
body
.
 
<EOS>
So
off
they
set
;
the
plaintiff
and
defendant
walking
arm
in
arm
,
the
officer
in
front
,
and
eight
stout
coachmen
bringing
up
the
rear
.
 
<EOS>
At
Serjeant
's
Inn
Coffee
-
house
the
whole
party
halted
to
refresh
,
and
,
the
legal
arrangements
being
completed
,
the
procession
moved
on
again
.
   
<EOS>
Some
little
commotion
was
occasioned
in
Fleet
Street
,
by
the
pleasantry
of
the
eight
gentlemen
in
the
flank
,
who
persevered
in
walking
four
abreast
;
it
was
also
found
necessary
to
leave
the
mottled
-
faced
gentleman
behind
,
to
fight
a
ticket
-
porter
,
it
being
arranged
that
his
friends
should
call
for
him
as
they
came
back
.
<EOS>
Nothing
but
these
little
incidents
occurred
on
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
reached
the
gate
of
the
Fleet
,
the
cavalcade
,
taking
the
time
from
the
plaintiff
,
gave
three
tremendous
cheers
for
the
defendant
,
and
,
after
having
shaken
hands
all
round
,
left
him
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
,
having
been
formally
delivered
into
the
warder
's
custody
,
to
the
intense
astonishment
of
Roker
,
and
to
the
evident
emotion
of
even
the
phlegmatic
Neddy
,
passed
at
once
into
the
prison
,
walked
straight
to
his
master
's
room
,
and
knocked
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
appeared
,
pulled
off
his
hat
,
and
smiled
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Sam
,
my
good
lad
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
evidently
delighted
to
see
his
humble
friend
again
;
"
I
had
no
intention
of
hurting
your
feelings
yesterday
,
<EOS>
my
faithful
fellow
,
by
what
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
Put
down
your

,
Sam

and
let

explain
my

a
little
more
at

"
   
<EOS>
"
Wo

"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly

Mr

;

why
not
now

"
   
<EOS>

I

rejoined

<EOS>
"
Why

inquired
Mr

.
   
<EOS>
"
'Cause

"
said
Sam
,
hesitating
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Because
of
what
?

inquired
Mr
Pickwick
,
alarmed
at
his
follower
's
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
out
,
Sam
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
'Cause

"
rejoined
Sam
---
"
'cause
I
've
got
a
little
bisness
as
I
want
to
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
business
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
,
surprised
at
Sam
's
confused
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothin'
partickler
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
if
it
's
nothing
particular
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
a
smile
,
"
you
can
speak
with
me
first
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
'd
better
see
arter
it
at
once
,
"
said
Sam
,
still
hesitating
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
looked
amazed
,
but
said
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
---
"
said
Sam
,
stopping
short
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
out
,
Sam
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
fact
is
,
"
said
Sam
,
with
a
desperate
effort
,
"
<EOS>
perhaps
I
'd
better
see
arter
<EOS>
my
bed
afore
<EOS>
I
do
anythin
'
else
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
YOUR
BED

"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
,
in
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
bed
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Sam
,
"
I
'm
a
prisoner

I
was

here

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You

"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
,
sinking
into
a
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
for
debt
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
the
man
as
puts
me
in
,
"
ull
never
let
me
out
till
you
go
yourself

"
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
heart
and

"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
I
say
,
Sir

"
rejoined
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
it
's
forty
years
to
come
,
I
shall
be
a
prisoner

and
I
'm
very
glad
on

if

been

Now

"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
which
he
repeated
with
great
emphasis
and
violence
,
Sam
Weller
dashed
his
hat
upon
the
ground
,
in
a
most
unusual
state
of
excitement
;
and
then
,
folding
his
arms
,
looked
firmly
and
fixedly
in
his
master
's
face
.

Treats
of
divers
little
matters
which
occurred
in

and
of
Mr
Winkle
's
mysterious
behaviour
;
and
shows
how
the
poor
Chancery
prisoner
obtained
his
release
at
last
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
felt
a
great
deal
too
much
touched
by
the
warmth
of
Sam
's
attachment
,
to
be
able
to
exhibit
any
manifestation
of
anger
or
displeasure
at
the
precipitate
course
he
had
adopted
,
in
voluntarily
consigning
himself
to
a
debtor
's
prison
for
an
indefinite
period
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
point
on
which
he
persevered
in
demanding
an
explanation
,
was
,
the
name
of
Sam
's
detaining
creditor
;
but
this
Mr
Weller
as
perseveringly
withheld
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
o
'
no
use
,
sir
,
"
said
Sam
,
again
and
again
;
"
he
's
a
malicious
,
bad
-
disposed
,
vorldly
-
minded
,
spiteful

,
with
a

as
the
wirtuous

remarked
of

with
the
dropsy
,
<EOS>
ven
<EOS>
he
said
,
that
upon
the

rayther
leave

than
build
a
chapel
vith
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
consider
,
Sam
,
"
Mr
Pickwick
remonstrated
,
"
the
sum
is
so
small
that
it
can
very
easily
be
paid
;
and
having
made
up
My
mind
that
you
shall
stop
with
me
,
you
should
recollect
how
much
more
useful
you
would
be
,
if
you
could
go
outside
the
walls
.
"
<EOS>
"
Wery
much
obliged
to
you

"
replied
Mr

gravely
;
"
but
I

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Rather
not
do

Sam

"
   
<EOS>
"
Wy

down

<EOS>
o
'
this
here
unremorseful

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
no
favour
asking
him
to
take
his
money
,
Sam
,
"
reasoned
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Sam
,
"
but
it
'
ud
be
a
wery
<EOS>
great
favour
to
pay
it
,
and
<EOS>
he
do
n't
deserve
none
;
that
's
where
it
is
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Pickwick
,
rubbing
his
nose
with
an
air
of
some
vexation
<EOS>
,
Mr
Weller
thought
it
prudent
to
change
the
theme
of
the
discourse
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
takes
my
determination
on

"
remarked
Sam
,
"
and
you

yours

<EOS>

you
've
heerd

"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
paused
when
he
arrived
at
this
point
,
and
cast
a
comical
look
at
his
master
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
"
of
course
"
in
the
case
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
gradually
breaking
into
a
smile
,
in
spite
of
the
uneasiness
which
Sam
's
obstinacy
had
given
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
fame
of

<EOS>
"
No

Mr

<EOS>
The
patient
looks
him
full
in
the
face
,
and
turns
it
over
in
his
mind
for
a
long
time
,
and
at
last
he
says
,
"
Are

"
 
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
do
that
for
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
abruptly
;
for
he
was
considerably
startled
by
this
tragical
termination
of
the
narrative
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
did
he
do
it
for
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
reiterated
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wy
,
in
support
of
his
great
principle
that
crumpets
wos
wholesome
,
and
to
show
that
he
would
n't
be
put
out
of
his
way
for
nobody
!
"
<EOS>
With
such
like
shiftings
and
changings
of
the
discourse
,
did
Mr
Weller
meet
his
master
's
questioning
on
the
night
of
his
taking
up
his
residence
in
the
Fleet
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
all
gentle
remonstrance
useless
,
Mr
Pickwick
at
length
yielded
a
reluctant
consent
to
his
taking
lodgings
by
the
week
,
of
a
bald
-
headed
cobbler
,
who
rented
a
small
slip
room
in
one
of
the
upper
galleries
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
humble
apartment
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
moved
a
mattress
and
bedding
,
which
he
hired
of
Mr
Roker
;
and
,
by
the
time
he
lay
down
upon
it
at
night
,
was
as
much
at
home
as
if
he
had
been
bred
in
the
prison
,
and
his
whole
family
had
vegetated
therein
for
three
generations
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
always
smoke
arter
you
goes
to
bed
,
old
cock
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Weller
of
his
landlord
,
when
they
had
both
retired
for
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
does
,
young
bantam
,
"
replied
the
cobbler
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
allow
me
to
in
-
quire
<EOS>
wy
<EOS>
you
make
up
your
bed
under
that
'
ere
deal
table
?
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
'Cause
I
was
always
used
to
a
four
-
poster
afore
<EOS>
I
came
here
,
and
I
find
the
legs
of
the
table
answer
just
as
well
,
"
replied
the
cobbler
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
character
,
sir
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
got
anything
of
the
kind
belonging
to
me
,
"
rejoined
the
cobbler
,
shaking
his
head
;
"
and
if
you
want
to
meet
with
a
good
one
,
I
'm
afraid
you
'll
find
some
difficulty
in
suiting
yourself
at
this
register
office
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
above
short
dialogue
took
place
as
Mr
Weller
lay
extended
on
his
mattress
at
one
end
of
the
room
,
and
the
cobbler
on
his
,
at
the
other
;
the
apartment
being
illumined
by
the
light
of
a
rush
-
candle
,
and
the
cobbler
's
pipe
,
which
was
glowing
below
the
table
,
like
a
red
-
hot
coal
.
 
<EOS>
The
conversation
,
brief
as
it
was
,
predisposed
Mr
Weller
strongly
in
his
landlord
's
favour
;
and
,
raising
himself
on
his
elbow
<EOS>
,
he
took
a
more
lengthened
survey
of
his
appearance
than
he
had
yet
had
either
time
or
inclination
to
make
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
sallow
man
---
all
cobblers
are
;
and
had
a
strong
bristly
beard
---
all
cobblers
have
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
was
a
queer
,
good
-
tempered
,
crooked
-
featured
piece
of
workmanship
,
ornamented
with
a
couple
of
eyes
that
must
have
worn
a
very
joyous
expression
at
one
time
,
for
they
sparkled
yet
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
was
sixty
,
by
years
,
and
Heaven
knows
how
old
by
imprisonment
,
so
that
his
having
any
look
approaching
to
mirth
or
contentment
,
was
singular
enough
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
little
man
,
and
,
being
half
doubled
up
as
he
lay
in
bed
,
looked
about
as
long
as
he
ought
to
have
been
without
his
legs
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
great
red
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
and
was
smoking
,
and
staring
at
the
rush
-
light
,
in
a
state
of
enviable
placidity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
been
here
long
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
,
breaking
the
silence
which
had
lasted
for
some
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Twelve
year
,
"
replied
the
cobbler
,
biting
the
end
of
his
pipe
as
he
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
Contempt
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
.
     
<EOS>
The
cobbler
nodded
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
said
Sam
,
with
some
sternness
,
"
wot
<EOS>
do
you
persevere
in
bein
'
obstinit
for
,
vastin
'
your
precious
life
away
,
in
this
here
magnified
pound
?
 
<EOS>
Wy
do
n't
you
give
in
,
and
tell
the
Chancellorship
that
you
're
wery
sorry
for
makin
'
his
court
contemptible
,
and
you
wo
n't
do
so
no
more
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
cobbler
put
his
pipe
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
,
while
he
smiled
,
and
then
brought
it
back
to
its
old
place
again
;
but
said
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wy
do
n't
you
?
"
said
Sam
,
urging
his
question
strenuously
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
the
cobbler
,
"
you
do
n't
quite
understand
these
matters
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
suppose
ruined
me
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wy
,
"
said
Sam
,
trimming
the
rush
-
light
,
"
I
s'pose
the
beginnin
'
wos
,
that
you
got
into
debt
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
owed
a
farden
,
"
said
the
cobbler
;
"
try
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
perhaps
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
you
bought
houses
<EOS>
,
wich
is
delicate
English
for
goin'
mad
;
or
took
to
buildin
'
,
wich
is
a
medical
term
for
bein
'
incurable
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
cobbler
shook
his
head
and
said
,
"
Try
again
.
"
     
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
go
to
law
,
I
hope
?
"
said
Sam
suspiciously
.
     
<EOS>
"
Never
in
my
life
,
"
replied
the
cobbler
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
I
was
ruined
by
having
money
left
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
that
von't
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
<EOS>
some
rich
enemy

try
to
vork
my

<EOS>
I
'd
let
him
.
"
     
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
dare
say
you
do
n't
believe
it
,
"
said
the
cobbler
,
quietly
smoking
his
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
if
I
was
you
;
but
it
's
true
for
all
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
wos
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
,
half
induced
to
believe
the
fact
already
,
by
the
look
the
cobbler
gave
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Just
this
,
"
replied
the
cobbler
;
"
an
old
gentleman
that
I
worked
for
,
down
in
the
country
,
and
a
humble
relation
of
whose
I
married
<EOS>
---
she
's
dead
,
God
bless
her
,
and
thank
Him
for
it
!
<EOS>
---
was
seized
with
a
fit
and
went
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
inquired
Sam
,
who
was
growing
sleepy
after
the
numerous
events
of
the
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
know
where
he
went
?
"
said
the
cobbler
,
speaking
through
his
nose
in
an
intense
enjoyment
of
his
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
went
off
dead
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
indeed
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
the
cobbler
,
"
he
left
five
thousand
pound
behind
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
wery
gen
-
teel
in
him
so
to
do

"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
of
which

"
continued
the
cobbler
,
"
he
left

"
cause
I

you
see

"
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
good

"
murmured
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
being
surrounded
by
a
great
number
of
nieces
and
nevys
,
as
was
always
quarrelling
and
fighting
among
themselves
for
the
property
,
he
makes
me
his
executor

and
leaves
the
rest
to
me
in
trust

to
divide

"
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
do
you
mean
by
leavin

it
on

"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
,
waking
up
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
it
ai
n't
ready
-
money

were
's
the

"
     
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
law
term
<EOS>
,
that
's
all

"
said
the
cobbler
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
that

"
said
Sam
,
shaking
his
head

<EOS>
"
There

<EOS>
Hows'ever

go

"
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
the
cobbler
,
"
when
I
was
going
to
take
out
a
probate
of
the
will
,
the
nieces
and
nevys
,
who
was
desperately
disappointed
at
not
getting
all
the
money
,
enters
a
caveat
against
it
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
legal
instrument
,
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
,
it
's
no
go
,
"
replied
the
cobbler
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
a
sort
of
brother
-
in
-
law
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
the
have
-
his
-
carcass
.
<EOS>
Well
.
"
   
"
But
,
"
continued
the
cobbler
,
"
finding
that
they
could
n't
agree
among
themselves
,
and
consequently
could
n't
get
up
a
case
against
the
will
,
they
withdrew
the
caveat
,
and
I
paid
all
the
legacies
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
hardly
done
it
,
when
one
nevy
brings
an
action
to
set
the
will
aside
.
 
<EOS>
The
case
comes
on
,
some
months
afterwards
,
afore
a
deaf
old
gentleman
,
in
a
back
room
somewhere
down
by
Paul
's
Churchyard
;
and
arter
four
counsels
had
taken
a
day
a
-
piece
to
bother
him
regularly
,
he
takes
a
week
or
two
to
consider
,
and
read
the
evidence
in
six
volumes
,
and
then
gives
his
judgment
that
how
the
testator
was
not
quite
right
in
his
head
,
and
I
must
pay
all
the
money
back
again
,
and
all
the
costs
.
 
<EOS>
I
appealed
;
the
case
come
on
before
three
or
four
very
sleepy
gentlemen
,
who
had
heard
it
all
before
in
the
other
court
,
where
they
're
lawyers
without
work
;
the
only
difference
being
,
that
,
there
,
they
're
called
doctors
,
and
in
the
other
place
delegates
,
if
you
understand
that
;
and
they
very
dutifully
confirmed
the
decision
of
the
old
gentleman
below
.
 
<EOS>
After
that
,
we
went
into
Chancery
,
where
we
are
still
,
and
where
I
shall
always
be
.
 
<EOS>
My
lawyers
have
had
all
my
thousand
pound
long
ago
;
and
what
between
the
estate
,
as
they
call
it
,
and
the
costs
,
I
'm
here
for
ten
thousand
,
and
shall
stop
here
,
till
I
die
,

Some
gentlemen
have
talked
of
bringing
it
before
Parliament
,
and
I
dare
say
would
have
done
it
,
only
they
had
n't
time
to
come
to
me
,
and
I
had
n't
power
to
go
to
them
,
and
they
got
tired
of
my
long
letters
,
and
dropped
the
business
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
is
God
's
truth
,
without
one
word
of
suppression
or
exaggeration
,
as
fifty
people
,
both
in
this
place
and
out
of
it
,
very
well
know
.

<EOS>
The
cobbler
paused
to
ascertain
what
effect
his
story
had
produced
on
Sam
;
but
finding
that
he
had
dropped
asleep
,
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
,
sighed
,
put
it
down
,
drew
the
bed
-
clothes
over
his
head
,
and
went
to
sleep
,
too
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
sitting
at
breakfast
,
alone
,
next
morning
(
Sam
being
busily
engaged
in
the
cobbler
's
room
,
polishing
his
master
's
shoes
and
brushing
the
black
gaiters
)
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
,
which
,
before
Mr
Pickwick
could
cry
"
Come
in
!
"
was
followed
by
the
appearance
of
a
head
of
hair
and
a
cotton
-
velvet
cap
,
both
of
which
articles
of
dress
he
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
as
the
personal
property
of
Mr
Smangle
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
?
"
said
that
worthy
,
accompanying
the
inquiry
with
a
score
or
two
of
nods
;
"
I
say
---
do
you
expect
anybody
this
morning
?
 
<EOS>
Three
men
---
devilish
gentlemanly
fellows
---
have
been
asking
after
you
downstairs
,
and
knocking
at
every
door
on
the
hall
flight
;
for
which
they
've
been
most
infernally
blown
up
by
the
collegians
that
had
the
trouble
of
opening
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
How
very
foolish
of
them
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
rising
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
have
no
doubt
they
are
some
friends
whom
I
rather
expected
to
see
,
yesterday
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Friends
of
yours
!
"
exclaimed
Smangle
,
seizing
Mr
Pickwick
by
the
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Curse
me
,
they
're
friends
of
mine
from
this
minute
,
and
friends
of
Mivins
's
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
Infernal
pleasant
,
gentlemanly
dog
,
Mivins
,
is
n't
he
?
"
said
Smangle
,
with
great
feeling
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
so
little
of
the
gentleman
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
hesitating
,
"
that
I
---
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
do
,
"
interrupted
Smangle
,
clasping
Mr
Pickwick
by
the
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
know
him
better
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
be
delighted
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
That
man
,
Sir
,
"
said
Smangle
,
with
a
solemn
countenance
,
"
has
comic
powers
that
would
do
honour
to
Drury
Lane
Theatre
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Has
he
indeed
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
by
Jove
he
has
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Smangle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
him
come
the
four
cats
in
the
wheel
-
barrow
---
four
distinct
cats
,
sir
<EOS>
,
I
pledge
you
my
honour
.
 
<EOS>
Now
you
know
that
's
infernal
clever
!
 
<EOS>
Damme
,
you
ca
n't
help
liking
a
man
,
when
you
see
these
traits
about
him
.
<EOS>
He
's
only
one
fault
---
that
little
failing
<EOS>
I
mentioned
to
you
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Smangle
shook
his
head
in
a
confidential
and
sympathising
manner
at
this
juncture
,
Mr
Pickwick
felt
that
he
was
expected
to
say
something
,
so
he
said
,
"
Ah
!
"
and
looked
restlessly
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
echoed
Mr
Smangle
,
with
a
long
-
drawn
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
delightful
company
,
that
man
is
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
better
company
anywhere
;
but
he
has
that
one
drawback
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
ghost
of
his
grandfather
,
Sir
,
was
to
rise
before
him
this
minute
,
he
'd
ask
him
for
the
loan
of
his
acceptance
on
an
eightpenny
stamp
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
added
Mr
Smangle
;
"
and
if
he
'd
the
power
of
raising
him
again
,
he
would
,
in
two
months
and
three
days
from
this
time
,
to
renew
the
bill
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Those
are
very
remarkable
traits
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
but
I
'm
afraid
that
while
we
are
talking
here
,
my
friends
may
be
in
a
state
of
great
perplexity
at
not
finding
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
show
'em
the
way
,
"
said
Smangle
,
making
for
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
disturb
you
while
they
're
here
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
bye
---
"
   
As
Smangle
pronounced
the
last
three
words
,
he
stopped
suddenly
,
reclosed
the
door
which
he
had
opened
,
and
,
walking
softly
back
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
stepped
close
up
to
him
on
tiptoe
,
and
said
,
in
a
very
soft
whisper
---
   
<EOS>
"
You
could
n't
make
it
convenient
to
lend
me
half
-
a
-
crown
till
the
latter
end
of
next
week
,
could
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
could
scarcely
forbear
smiling
,
but
managing
to
preserve
his
gravity
,
he
drew
forth
the
coin
,
and
placed
it
in
Mr
Smangle
's
palm
;
upon
which
,
that
gentleman
,
with
many
nods
and
winks
,
implying
profound
mystery
,
disappeared
in
quest
of
the
three
strangers
,
with
whom
he
presently
returned
;
and
having
coughed
thrice
,
and
nodded
as
many
times
,
as
an
assurance
to
Mr
Pickwick
that
he
would
not
forget
to
pay
,
he
shook
hands
all
round
,
in
an
engaging
manner
,
and
at
length
took
himself
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friends
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
shaking
hands
alternately
with
Mr
Tupman
,
Mr
Winkle
,
and
Mr
Snodgrass
,
who
were
the
three
visitors
in
question
,
"
I
am
delighted
to
see
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
triumvirate
were
much
affected
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
shook
his
head
deploringly
,
Mr
Snodgrass
drew
forth
his
handkerchief
,
with
undisguised
emotion
;
and
Mr
Winkle
retired
to
the
window
,
and
sniffed
aloud
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mornin
'
,
gen'l'm'n

"
said
Sam
,
entering
at
the
moment
with
the
shoes
and
gaiters
.
 
<EOS>
"
Avay
vith
melincholly

"
     
<EOS>
"
This
foolish
fellow

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
tapping
Sam
on
the
head
as
he
knelt
down
to
button
up
his
master
's
gaiters
<EOS>
---
"
this
foolish
fellow
has
got
himself
arrested
,
in
order
to
be
near
me
.
"
     
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
exclaimed
the
three
friends
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
gen'l'm'n
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
I
'm
a
---
stand
steady
,
<EOS>
sir
,
if
you
please
---
I
'm
a
prisoner
,
gen'l'm'n

<EOS>
Con
-
fined
,
as
the
lady
said
.
<EOS>
"
     
"
A
prisoner
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Winkle
,
with
unaccountable
vehemence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
,
sir
!
"
responded
Sam
,
looking
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wot
's
the
matter
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
hoped
,
Sam
,
that
---
 
Nothing
,
nothing
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
precipitately
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
very
abrupt
and
unsettled
in
Mr
Winkle
's
manner
,
that
Mr
Pickwick
involuntarily
looked
at
his
two
friends
for
an
explanation
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
answering
this
mute
appeal
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
much
excited
for
two
days
past
,
and
his
whole
demeanour
very
unlike
what
it
usually
is
.
 
<EOS>
We
feared
there
must
be
something
the
matter
,
but
he
resolutely
denies
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
colouring
beneath
Mr
Pickwick
's
gaze
;
"
there
is
really
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
there
is
nothing
,
my
dear
sir
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
leave
town
,
for
a
short
time
,
on
private
business
,
and
I
had
hoped
to
have
prevailed
upon
you
to
allow
Sam
to
accompany
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
looked
more
astonished
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
faltered
Mr
Winkle
,
"
that
Sam
would
have
had
no
objection
to
do
so
;
but
,
of
course
,
his
being
a
prisoner
here
,
renders
it
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
must
go
alone
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Winkle
said
these
words
,
Mr
Pickwick
felt
,
with
some
astonishment
,
that
Sam
's
fingers
were
trembling
at
the
gaiters
,
as
if
he
were
rather
surprised
or
startled
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
looked
up
at
Mr
Winkle
,
too
,
when
he
had
finished
speaking
;
and
though
the
glance
they
exchanged
was
instantaneous
,
they
seemed
to
understand
each
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
anything
of
this
,
Sam
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
sharply
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
do
n't
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
,
beginning
to
button
with
extraordinary
assiduity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
,
Sam
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wy
,
sir
,
"
responded
Mr
Weller
;
"
I
'm
sure
so
far
,
that
I
've
never
heerd
anythin
'
on
the
subject
afore
this
moment
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
makes
any
guess
about
it
,
"
added
Sam
,
looking
at
Mr
Winkle
,
"
I
have
n't
got
any
right
to
say
what
"
It
is
<EOS>
,
fear
it
should
be
a
wrong
'
un
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
right
to
make
any
further
inquiry
into
the
private
affairs
of
a
friend
,
however
intimate
a
friend
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
after
a
short
silence
;
"
at
present
let
me
merely
say
,
that
I
do
not
understand
this
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
There
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
had
quite
enough
of
the
subject
.
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
expressing
himself
,
Mr
Pickwick
led
the
conversation
to
different
topics
,
and
Mr
Winkle
gradually
appeared
more
at
ease
,
though
still
very
far
from
being
completely
so
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
all
so
much
to
converse
about
,
that
the
morning
very
quickly
passed
away
;
and
when
,
at
three
o'clock
,
Mr
Weller
produced
upon
the
little
dining
-
table
,
a
roast
leg
of
mutton
and
an
enormous
meat
-
pie
,
with
sundry
dishes
of
vegetables
,
and
pots
of
porter
,
which
stood
upon
the
chairs
or
the
sofa
bedstead
,
or
where
they
could
,
everybody
felt
disposed
to
do
justice
to
the
meal
,
notwithstanding
that
the
meat
had
been
purchased
,
and
dressed
,
and
the
pie
made
,
and
baked
,
at
the
prison
cookery
hard
by
.
   
<EOS>
To
these
succeeded
a
bottle
or
two
of
very
good
wine
,
for
which
a
messenger
was
despatched
by
Mr
Pickwick
to
the
Horn
Coffee
-
house
,
in
Doctors
"
Commons
.
 
<EOS>
The
bottle
or
two
,
indeed
,
might
be
more
properly
described
as
a
bottle
or
six
,
for
by
the
time
it
was
drunk
,
and
tea
over
,
the
bell
began
to
ring
for
strangers
to
withdraw
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
if
Mr
Winkle
's
behaviour
had
been
unaccountable
in
the
morning
,
it
became
perfectly
unearthly
and
solemn
when
,
under
the
influence
of
his
feelings
,
and
his
share
of
the
bottle
or
six
,
he
prepared
to
take
leave
of
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
He
lingered
behind
,
until
Mr
Tupman
and
Mr
Snodgrass
had
disappeared
,
and
then
fervently
clenched
Mr
Pickwick
's
hand
,
with
an
expression
of
face
in
which
deep
and
mighty
resolve
was
fearfully
blended
with
the
very
concentrated
essence
of
gloom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
my
dear
Sir
!
"
said
Mr
Winkle
between
his
set
teeth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
,
my
dear
fellow
!
"
replied
the
warm
-
hearted
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
he
returned
the
pressure
of
his
young
friend
's
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
then
!
"
cried
Mr
Tupman
from
the
gallery
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
directly
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
another
good
-
night
,
and
another
,
and
half
a
dozen
more
after
that
,
and
still
Mr
Winkle
had
fast
hold
of
his
friend
's
hand
,
and
was
looking
into
his
face
with
the
same
strange
expression
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
anything
the
matter
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
at
last
,
when
his
arm
was
quite
sore
with
shaking
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
good
-
night
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
attempting
to
disengage
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
friend
,
my
benefactor
,
my
honoured
companion
,
"
murmured
Mr
Winkle
,
catching
at
his
wrist
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
judge
me
harshly
;
do
not
,
when
you
hear
that
,
driven
to
extremity
by
hopeless
obstacles
,
I
---
"
   
"
Now
then
,
"
said
Mr
Tupman
,
reappearing
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
coming
,
or
are
we
to
be
locked
in
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
I
am
ready
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
And
with
a
violent
effort
he
tore
himself
away
.
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Pickwick
was
gazing
down
the
passage
after
them
in
silent
astonishment
,
Sam
Weller
appeared
at
the
stair
-
head
,
and
whispered
for
one
moment
in
Mr
Winkle
's
ear
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
,
depend
upon
me
,
"
said
that
gentleman
aloud
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee

sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
forget
,
sir

"
said

"
Of
course
not
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wish
you
luck
,
Sir
,
"
said
Sam
,
touching
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
very
much
liked
to
ha
'
joined
you
,
Sir
;
but
the
gov'nor
,
o

course
,
is
paramount
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
much
to
your
credit
that
you
remain
here
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
.
 
<EOS>
With
these
words
they
disappeared
down
the
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
,
Very
extraordinary
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
going
back
into
his
room
,
and
seating
himself
at
the
table
in
a
musing
attitude
.
<EOS>
"
What
can
that
young
man
be
going
to
do
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
sat
ruminating
about
the
matter
for
some
time
,
when
the
voice
of
Roker
,
the
turnkey
,
demanded
whether
he
might
come
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
brought
you
a
softer
pillow
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Roker
,
"
instead
of
the
temporary
one
you
had
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
take
a
glass
of
wine
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
wery
good
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Roker
,
accepting
the
proffered
glass
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yours
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
to
say
that
your
landlord
's
wery
bad
to
-
night
,
Sir
,
"
said
Roker
,
setting
down
the
glass
,
and
inspecting
the
lining
of
his
hat
preparatory
to
putting
it
on
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
The
Chancery
prisoner
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
wo
n't
be
a
Chancery
prisoner
wery
long
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Roker
,
turning
his
hat
round
,
so
as
to
get
the
maker
's
name
right
side
upwards
,
as
he
looked
into
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
make
my
blood
run
cold
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
been
consumptive
for
a
long
time
past
,
"
said
Mr
Roker
,
"
and
he
's
taken
wery
bad
in
the
breath
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
doctor
said
,
six
months
ago
,
that
nothing
but
change
of
air
could
save
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Great
Heaven
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
has
this
man
been
slowly
murdered
by
the
law
for
six
months
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
that
,
"
replied
Roker
,
weighing
the
hat
by
the
brim
in
both
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
'd
have
been
took
the
same
,
wherever
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
into
the
infirmary
,
this
morning
;
the
doctor
says
his
strength
is
to
be
kept
up
as
much
as
possible
;
and
the
warden
's
sent
him
wine
and
broth
and
that
,
from
his
own
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
the
warden
's
fault
,
you
know
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
hastily
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
,
however
,
"
said
Roker
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
that
it
's
all
up
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
offered
Neddy
two
six
-
penn'orths
to
one
upon
it
just
now
,
but
he
would
n't
take
it
,
and
quite
right
.
 
<EOS>
Thank'ee
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
this
infirmary
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
over
where
you
slept
,
sir
,
"
replied
Roker
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
show
you
,
if
you
like
to
come
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
snatched
up
his
hat
without
speaking
,
and
followed
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
The
turnkey
led
the
way
in
silence
;
and
gently
raising
the
latch
of
the
room
door
,
motioned
Mr
Pickwick
to
enter
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
large
,
bare
,
desolate
room
,
with
a
number
of
stump
bedsteads
made
of
iron
,
on
one
of
which
lay
<EOS>
stretched
the
shadow
of
a
man
 
---
wan
,
pale
,
and
ghastly
.
 
<EOS>
His
breathing
was
hard
and
thick
,
and
he
moaned
painfully
as
it
came
and
went
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
bedside
sat
a
short
old
man
in
a
cobbler
's
apron
,
who
,
by
the
aid
of
a
pair
of
horn
spectacles
,
was
reading
from
the
Bible
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
fortunate
legatee
.
   
<EOS>
The
sick
man
laid
his
hand
upon
his
attendant
's
arm
,
and
motioned
him
to
stop
.
 
<EOS>
He
closed
the
book
,
and
laid
it
on
the
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Open
the
window
,
"
said
the
sick
man
.
   
<EOS>
He
did
so
.
 
<EOS>
The
noise
of
carriages
and
carts
,
the
rattle
of
wheels
,
the
cries
of
men
and
boys
,
all
the
busy
sounds
of
a
mighty
multitude
instinct
with
life
and
occupation
,
blended
into
one
deep
murmur
,
floated
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Above
the
hoarse
loud
hum
,
arose
,
from
time
to
time
,
a
boisterous
laugh
;
or
a
scrap
of
some
jingling
song
,
shouted
forth
,
by
one
of
the
giddy
crowd
,
would
strike
upon
the
ear
,
for
an
instant
,
and
then
be
lost
amidst
the
roar
of
voices
and
the
tramp
of
footsteps
;
the
breaking
of
the
billows
of
the
restless
sea
of
life
,
that
rolled
heavily
on
,
without
.
<EOS>
These
are
melancholy
sounds
to
a
quiet
listener
at
any
time
;
but
how
melancholy
to
the
watcher
by
the
bed
of
death
!
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
air
here
,
"
said
the
man
faintly
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
place
pollutes
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
fresh
round
about
,
when
I
walked
there
,
years
ago
;
but
it
grows
hot
and
heavy
in
passing
these
walls
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
breathe
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
breathed
it
together
,
for
a
long
time
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
short
silence
,
during
which
the
two
spectators
approached
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
The
sick
man
drew
a
hand
of
his
old
fellow
-
prisoner
towards
him
,
and
pressing
it
affectionately
between
both
his
own
,
retained
it
in
his
grasp
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
he
gasped
after
a
while
,
so
faintly
that
they
bent
their
ears
close
over
the
bed
to
catch
the
half
-
formed
sounds
his
pale
lips
gave
vent
to
---
"
I
hope
my
merciful
Judge
will
bear
in
mind
my
heavy
punishment
on
earth
.
 
<EOS>
Twenty
years
,
my
friend
,
twenty
years
in
this
hideous
grave
!
 
<EOS>
My
heart
broke
when
my
child
died
,
and
I
could
not
even
kiss
him
in
his
little
coffin
.
 
<EOS>
My
loneliness
since
then
,
in
all
this
noise
and
riot
,
has
been
very
dreadful
.
 
<EOS>
May
God
forgive
me
!
 
<EOS>
He
has
seen
my
solitary
,
lingering
death
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
folded
his
hands
,
and
murmuring
something
more
they
could
not
hear
,
fell
into
a
sleep
---
only
a
sleep
at
first
,
for
they
saw
him
smile
.
   
<EOS>
They
whispered
together
for
a
little
time
,
and
the
turnkey
,
stooping
over
the
pillow
,
drew
hastily
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
got
his
discharge
,
by
G
---
!
"
said
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
grown
so
like
death
in
life
,
that
they
knew
not
when
he
died
.

Chapter

<EOS>
Descriptive
of
an
affecting
interview
between
Mr
Samuel
Weller
and
a
family
party
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
makes
a
tour
of
the
diminutive
world
he
inhabits
,
and
resolves
to
mix
with
it
,
in
future
,
as
little
as
possible
 
A
few
mornings
after
his
incarceration
,
Mr
Samuel
Weller
,
having
arranged
his
master
's
room
with
all
possible
care
,
and
seen
him
comfortably
seated
over
his
books
and
papers
,
withdrew
to
employ
himself
for
an
hour
or
two
to
come
,
as
he
best
could
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
morning
,
and
it
occurred
to
Sam
that
a
pint
of
porter
in
the
open
air
would
lighten
his
next
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
,
as
well
as
any
little
amusement
in
which
he
could
indulge
.
   
<EOS>
Having
arrived
at
this
conclusion
,
he
betook
himself
to
the
tap
.
 
<EOS>
Having
purchased
the
beer
,
and
obtained
,
moreover
,
the
day
-
but
-
one
-
before
-
yesterday
's
paper
,
he
repaired
to
the
skittle
-
ground
,
and
seating
himself
on
a
bench
,
proceeded
to
enjoy
himself
in
a
very
sedate
and
methodical
manner
.
   
<EOS>
First
of
all
,
he
took
a
refreshing
draught
of
the
beer
,
and
then
he
looked
up
at
a
window
,
and
bestowed
a
platonic
wink
on
a
young
lady
who
was
peeling
potatoes
thereat
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
opened
the
paper
,
and
folded
it
so
as
to
get
the
police
reports
outwards
;
and
this
being
a
vexatious
and
difficult
thing
to
do
,
when
there
is
any
wind
stirring
,
he
took
another
draught
of
the
beer
when
he
had
accomplished
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
read
two
lines
of
the
paper
,
and
stopped
short
to
look
at
a
couple
of
men
who
were
finishing
a
game
at
rackets
,
which
,
being
concluded
,
he
cried
out
"
wery
good
,
"
in
an
approving
manner
,
and
looked
round
upon
the
spectators
,
to
ascertain
whether
their
sentiments
coincided
with
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
This
involved
the
necessity
of
looking
up
at
the
windows
also
;
and
as
the
young
lady
was
still
there
,
it
was
an
act
of
common
politeness
to
wink
again
,
and
to
drink
to
her
good
health
in
dumb
show
,
in
another
draught
of
the
beer
,
which
Sam
did
;
and
having
frowned
hideously
upon
a
small
boy
who
had
noted
this
latter
proceeding
with
open
eyes
,
he
threw
one
leg
over
the
other
,
and
,
holding
the
newspaper
in
both
hands
,
began
to
read
in
real
earnest
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
hardly
composed
himself
into
the
needful
state
of
abstraction
,
when
he
thought
he
heard
his
own
name
proclaimed
in
some
distant
passage
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
mistaken
,
for
it
quickly
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
,
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
air
teemed
with
shouts
of
"
Weller
!
"
<EOS>
"
Here
!
"
roared
Sam
,
in
a
stentorian
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wot
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
Who
wants
him
?
 
<EOS>
Has
an
express
come
to
say
that
his
country
house
is
afire
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Somebody
wants
you
in
the
hall
,
"
said
a
man
who
was
standing
by
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
mind
that
'
ere
paper
and
the
pot
,
old
feller
,
will
you
?
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
-
comin
'
.
 
<EOS>
Blessed
,
if
they
was
a
-
callin
'
me
to
the
bar
,
they
could
n't
make
more
noise
about
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
Accompanying
these
words
with
a
gentle
rap
on
the
head
of
the
young
gentleman
before
noticed
,
who
,
unconscious
of
his
close
vicinity
to
the
person
in
request
,
was
screaming
"
Weller
!
"
<EOS>
with
all
his
might
,
Sam
hastened
across
the
ground
,
and
ran
up
the
steps
into
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Here
,
the
first
object
that
met
his
eyes
was
his
beloved
father
sitting
on
a
bottom
stair
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
shouting
out
"
Weller
!
"
<EOS>
in
his
very
loudest
tone
,
at
half
-
minute
intervals
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
are
you
a
-
roarin
'
at
?
"
said
Sam
impetuously
,
when
the
old
gentleman
had
discharged
himself
of
another
shout
;
"
making
yourself
so
precious
hot
that
you
looks
like
a
aggrawated
glass
-
blower
.
<EOS>
Wot
's
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
replied
the
old
gentleman
,
"
I
began
to
be
afeerd
that
you
'd
gone
for
a
walk
round
the
Regency
Park
,
Sammy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come

"
said
Sam
,
"
none
<EOS>
o

<EOS>

taunts
agin
the
wictim

and

<EOS>
Wot

<EOS>
I
do
n't

.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
such
a
game
for
you
,
Sammy
,
"
said
the
elder
Mr
Weller
,
rising
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
minit
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
you
're
all
vite
behind
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
Sammy
,
rub
it
off
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
as
his
son
dusted
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
might
look
personal
here
,
if
a
man
walked
about
with
vitevash
on
his
clothes
,
eh
,
Sammy
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Weller
exhibited
in
this
place
unequivocal
symptoms
of
an
approaching
fit
of
chuckling
,
Sam
interposed
to
stop
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Keep
quiet
,
do
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
there
never
vos
such
a
old
picter
-
card
born

<EOS>
Wot
are
you
bustin

vith

"
   
<EOS>
"
Sammy

"
said
Mr
Weller
,
wiping
his
forehead
,
"
I
'm
afeerd
that
vun

these

I
shall
laugh
myself
into

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
then
,
wot
do

for

"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
then
,
wot
have

say
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
do

with

"
said
Mr
Weller
,
drawing
back
a
pace
or
two
,
pursing
up
his
mouth
,
and
extending
his
eyebrows
.
<EOS>
"
Pell
?
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
shook
his
head
,
and
his
red
cheeks
expanded
with
the
laughter
that
was
endeavouring
to
find

Again
Mr

shook
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who

"
asked
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your

said
Mr
Weller
;
and
it
was
lucky
he
did
say
it
,
or
his
cheeks
must
inevitably
have
cracked
,
from
their
most
unnatural
distension
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your

Mr

Ho

"
   
<EOS>
With
this
,
Mr
Weller
launched
into
convulsions
of
laughter
,
while
Sam
regarded
him
with
a
broad
grin
gradually
over
-
spreading
his
whole
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
've
come
to

a

serious

said
Mr

wiping
his

replied
his

<EOS>
"
Vere

"
<EOS>
said
Sam
,
reciprocating
all
the
old
gentleman
's
grins
.
   
<EOS>
"
In

rejoined
Mr

Mr

when
he
felt
himself
equal
to
the
task
of
speaking
in
an
articulate
manner

<EOS>
"

said
Sam

<EOS>
"
I

replied
Mr

in
a
rapture
of
winks

"
   
<EOS>
Here
the
old
gentleman
shook
his
head
from
side
to
side
,
and
was
seized
with
a
hoarse
internal
rumbling
,
accompanied
with
a
violent
swelling
of
the
countenance
,
and
a
sudden
increase
in
the
breadth
of
all
his
features
;
symptoms
which
alarmed
his

<EOS>
"

said
the

,
when
by
dint
of
much
struggling
,
and
various
convulsive
stamps
upon
the
ground
,
he
had
recovered
his
voice

<EOS>

Not

Sam

<EOS>
"
<EOS>

said
Mr

,
with
the
tears
still
running
down
his
cheeks
,

<EOS>
This
conversation
brought
them
to
the
door
of
the
snuggery
,
into
which
Sam
---
pausing
for
an
instant
to
look
over
his
shoulder
,
and
cast
a
sly
leer
at
his
respected
progenitor
,
who
was
still
giggling
behind
---
at
once
led
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Stiggins
raised
his
hands
,
and
turned
up
his
eyes
,
until
the
whites
---
or
rather
the
yellows
---
were
alone
visible
;
but
made
no
reply
in
words
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is

looking

in

for
explanation
.
   
<EOS>
"
The

Mrs

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh

said
Sam

<EOS>

Young

said
Mr

ostentatiously
,
"
I

not

"
   
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
I

said
Mr

in

loud
voice

<EOS>
"

replied
Sam

"
you

<EOS>
Wery

"
   
<EOS>
At
this
point
of
the
conversation
,
a
sound
,
indecorously
approaching
to
a
laugh
,
was
heard
to
proceed
from
the
chair
in
which
the
elder
Mr
Weller
was
seated
;
upon
which
Mrs
Weller
,
on
a
hasty
consideration
of
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
,
considered
it
her
bounden
duty
to
become
gradually
hysterical
.
   
<EOS>
"
Weller

"
said
Mrs
W
(
the
old
gentleman
was
seated
in
a
corner
)
;
"

Come

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wery

replied
Mr

;
"
but
I

"
   
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Mrs
Weller
burst
into
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
's
gone
wrong

"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh

"
replied
Mrs

,
"
your

<EOS>
Will

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Wery

replied
the

.
 
<EOS>
"
I

vould
benefit

a

.
 
<EOS>
Could

"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mrs
Weller
let
fall
some
more
tears
,
and
Mr
Stiggins
groaned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo

<EOS>
Here
's
this
unfortunate
gen'l'm'n
<EOS>

said
Sam
,
looking

.
 
<EOS>
"
Vere

"
   
<EOS>
"
In

"
rejoined
Mr

,
"
in
the

place
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Vere
may
that
be

inquired
Sam
,
with
great
outward
simplicity
.
   
<EOS>
"
In

buzzim
,
young
man

"
replied
Mr
Stiggins
,
placing
his
umbrella
on
his
waistcoat
.
   
<EOS>
At
this
affecting
reply
,
Mrs
Weller
,
being
wholly
unable
to
suppress
her
feelings
,
sobbed
aloud
,
and
stated
her
conviction
that
the
red
-
nosed
man
was
a
saint
;
whereupon
Mr
Weller
,
senior
,
ventured
to
suggest
,
in
an
undertone
,
that
he
must
be
the
representative
of
the
united
parishes
of
St
Simon
Without
and
<EOS>
St
Walker
Within
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afeered
,
mum
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
that
this
here
gen'l'm'n
,
with
the
twist
in
his
countenance
,
feels
rather
thirsty
,
with
the
melancholy
spectacle
afore
him
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
the
case
,
mum
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
worthy
lady
looked
at
Mr
Stiggins
for
a
reply
;
that
gentleman
,
with
many
rollings
of
the
eye
,
clenched
his
throat
with
his
right
hand
,
and
mimicked
the
act
of
swallowing
,
to
intimate
that
he
was
athirst
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
Samuel
,
that
his
feelings
have
made
him
so
indeed
,
"
said
Mrs
Weller
mournfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
's
your
usual
tap
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
young
friend

"
replied
Mr
Stiggins
,
"
all
taps
is
vanities
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Too
true
,
too
true
,
indeed
,
"
said
Mrs
Weller
,
murmuring
a
groan
,
and
shaking
her
head
assentingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
<EOS>
I
des
-
say
they
may
be

but
wich

<EOS>
Wich

"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

my

young
friend
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Mr
Stiggins
,
"
I
despise
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
"
said
Mr
Stiggins
---
"
if
there
is
any
one
of
them
less
odious
than
another
,
it
is
the
liquor
called
rum
.
 
<EOS>
Warm
,
my
dear
young
friend
,
with
three
lumps
of
sugar
to
the
tumbler
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
sorry
to
say
,
sir
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
that
they
do
n't
allow
that
particular
wanity
to
be
sold
in
this
here
establishment
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
the
hardness
of
heart
of
these
inveterate
men
!
"
ejaculated
Mr
Stiggins
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
the
accursed
cruelty
of
these
inhuman
persecutors
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
Mr
Stiggins
again
cast
up
his
eyes
,
and
rapped
his
breast
with
his
umbrella
;
and
it
is
but
<EOS>
justice
to
the
reverend
gentleman
to
say
,
that
his
indignation
appeared
very
real
and
unfeigned
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
After
Mrs
Weller
and
the
red
-
nosed
gentleman
had
commented
on
this
inhuman
usage
in
a
very
forcible
manner
,
and
had
vented
a
variety
of
pious
and
holy
execrations
against
its
authors
,
the
latter
recommended
a
bottle
of
port
wine
,
warmed
with
a
little
water
,
spice
,
and
sugar
,
as
being
grateful
to
the
stomach
,
and
savouring
less
of
vanity
than
many
other
compounds
.
<EOS>
It
was
accordingly
ordered
to
be
prepared
,
and
pending
its
preparation
the
red
-
nosed
man
and
Mrs
Weller
looked
at
the
elder
W
and
groaned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sammy
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
"
I
hope
you
'll
find
your
spirits
rose
by
this
here
lively
wisit
.
 
<EOS>
Wery
cheerful
and
improvin
'
<EOS>
conwersation
,
ai
n't

Sammy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
reprobate

"
replied
Sam
;
"
and
I
desire
you
wo
n't
address
no
more
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
them
ungraceful
remarks
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
So
far
from
being
edified
by
this
very
proper
reply
,
the
elder
Mr
Weller
at
once
relapsed
into
a
broad
grin
;
and
this
inexorable
conduct
causing
the
lady
and
Mr
Stiggins
to
close
their
eyes
,
and
rock
themselves
to
and
fro
on
their
chairs
,
in
a
troubled
manner
,
he
furthermore
indulged
in
several
acts
of
pantomime
,
indicative
of
a
desire
to
pummel
and
wring
the
nose
of
the
aforesaid
Stiggins
,
the
performance
of
which
,
appeared
to
afford
him
great
mental
relief
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
very
narrowly
escaped
detection
in
one
instance
;
for
Mr
Stiggins
happening
to
give
a
start
on
the
arrival
of
the
negus
,
brought
his
head
in
smart
contact
with
the
clenched
fist
with
which
Mr
Weller
had
been
describing
imaginary
fireworks
in
the
air
,
within
two
inches
of
his
ear
,
for
some
minutes
.
   
<EOS>
"

said
Sam

with
great
promptitude
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do

gen'l'm'n

<EOS>

,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
in
some
degree
abashed
by
the
very
unexpected
occurrence
of
the
incident
.
   
<EOS>
"
Try
an
in'ard
application
,
sir
,
"
said
Sam
,
as
the
red
-
nosed
gentleman
rubbed
his
head
with
a
rueful
visage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wot
do
you
think
o
'
that
,
for
a
go
o
'
wanity
,
warm
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Stiggins
made
no
verbal
answer
,
but
his
manner
was
expressive
.
 
<EOS>
He
tasted
the
contents
of
the
glass
which
Sam
had
placed
in
his
hand
,
put
his
umbrella
on
the
floor
,
and
tasted
it
again
,
passing
his
hand
placidly
across
his
stomach
twice
or
thrice
;
he
then
drank
the
whole
at
a
breath
,
and
smacking
his
lips
,
held
out
the
tumbler
for
more
.
   
<EOS>
Nor
was
Mrs
Weller
behind
-
hand
in
doing
justice
to
the
composition
.
 
<EOS>
The
good
lady
began
by
protesting
that
she
could
n't
touch
a
drop
---
then
took
a
small
drop
---
then
a
large
drop
---
then
a
great
many
drops
;
and
her
feelings
being
of
the
nature
of
those
substances
which
are
powerfully
affected
by
the
application
of
strong
waters
,
she
dropped
a
tear
with
every
drop
of
negus
,
and
so
got
on
,
melting
the
feelings
down
,
<EOS>
until
at
length
she
had
arrived
at
a
very
pathetic
and
decent
pitch
of
misery
.
   
<EOS>
The
elder
Mr
Weller
observed
these
signs
and
tokens
with
many
manifestations
of
disgust
,
and
when
,
after
a
second
jug
of
the
same
,
Mr
Stiggins
began
to
sigh
in
a
dismal
manner
,
he
plainly
evinced
his
disapprobation
of
the
whole
proceedings
,
by
sundry
incoherent
ramblings
of
speech
,
among
which
frequent
angry
repetitions
of
the
word
"
gammon
"
were
alone
distinguishable
to
the
ear
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
wot
<EOS>
it
is
,
Samivel
,
my
boy
,
"
whispered
the
old
gentleman
into
his
son
's
ear
,
after
a
long
and
steadfast
contemplation
of
his
lady
and
Mr
Stiggins
;
"
I
think
there
must
be
somethin'
wrong
in
your
mother
-
in
-
law
's
inside
,
as
vell
as
in
that
o
'
the
red
-
nosed
man
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
do
you
mean
?
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
this
here
,
Sammy
,
"
replied
the
old
gentleman
,
"
that
wot
they
drink
,
do
n't
seem
no
nourishment
to
'em
;
it
all
turns
to
warm
water
,
and
comes
a
-
pourin
'
out
<EOS>
o
'
their
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pend
upon
it
,
Sammy
<EOS>
,
it
's
a
constitootional
infirmity
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
delivered
this
scientific
opinion
with
many
confirmatory
frowns
and
nods
;
which
,
Mrs
Weller
remarking
,
and
concluding
that
they
bore
some
disparaging
reference
either
to
herself
or
to
Mr
Stiggins
,
or
to
both
,
was
on
the
point
of
becoming
infinitely
worse
,
when
Mr
Stiggins
,
getting
on
his
legs
as
well
as
he
could
,
proceeded
to
deliver
an
edifying
discourse
for
the
benefit
of
the
company
,
but
more
especially
of
Mr
Samuel
,
whom
he
adjured
in
moving
terms
to
be
upon
his
guard
in
that
sink
of
iniquity
into
which
he
was
cast
;
to
abstain
from
all
hypocrisy
and
pride
of
heart
;
and
to
take
in
all
things
exact
pattern
and
copy
by
him
(
Stiggins
)
,
in
which
case
he
might
calculate
on
arriving
,
sooner
or
later
at
the
comfortable
conclusion
,
that
,
like
him
,
he
was
a
most
estimable
and
blameless
character
,
and
that
all
his
acquaintances
and
friends
were
hopelessly
abandoned
and
profligate
wretches
.
 
<EOS>
Which
consideration
,
he
said
,
could
not
but
afford
him
the
liveliest
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
He
furthermore
conjured
him
to
avoid
,
above
all
things
,
the
vice
of
intoxication
,
which
he
likened
unto
the
filthy
habits
of
swine
,
and
to
those
poisonous
and
baleful
drugs
which
being
chewed
in
the
mouth
,
are
said
to
filch
away
the
memory
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
point
of
his
discourse
,
the
reverend
and
red
-
nosed
gentleman
became
singularly
incoherent
,
and
staggering
to
and
fro
in
the
excitement
of
his
eloquence
,
was
fain
to
catch
at
the
back
of
a
chair
to
preserve
his
perpendicular
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Stiggins
did
not
desire
his
hearers
to
be
upon
their
guard
against
those
false
prophets
and
wretched
mockers
of
religion
,
who
,
without
sense
to
expound
its
first
doctrines
,
or
hearts
to
feel
its
first
principles
,
are
more
dangerous
members
of
society
than
the
common
criminal
;
imposing
,
as
they
necessarily
do
,
upon
the
weakest
and
worst
informed
,
casting
scorn
and
contempt
on
what
should
be
held
most
sacred
,
and
bringing
into
partial
disrepute
large
bodies
of
virtuous
and
well
-
conducted
persons
of
many
excellent
sects
and
persuasions
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
he
leaned
over
the
back
of
the
chair
for
a
considerable
time
,
and
closing
one
eye
,
winked
a
good
deal
with
the
other
,
it
is
presumed
that
he
thought
all
this
,
but
kept
it
to
himself
.
   
<EOS>
During
the
delivery
of
the
oration
,
Mrs
Weller
sobbed
and
wept
at
the
end
of
the
paragraphs
;
while
Sam
,
sitting
cross
-
legged
on
a
chair
and
resting
his
arms
on
the
top
rail
,
regarded
the
speaker
with
great
suavity
and
blandness
of
demeanour
;
occasionally
bestowing
a
look
of
recognition
on
the
old
gentleman
,
who
was
delighted
at
the
beginning
,
and
went
to
sleep
about
half
-
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
Brayvo
;
wery
pretty
!
"
said
Sam
,
when
the
red
-
nosed
man
having
finished
,
pulled
his
worn
gloves
on
,
thereby
thrusting
his
fingers
through
the
broken
tops
till
the
knuckles
were
disclosed
to
view
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wery
pretty
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
may
do
you
good

Samuel

"
said
Mrs
Weller
solemnly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
vill
,
mum

"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
hope
that
it
would
do
your
father
good
,
"
said
Mrs
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee

said
Mr
Weller
,
senior
.
 
<EOS>
"
How

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Scoffer

"
exclaimed
Mrs
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Benighted
man

"
said
the
Reverend
Mr
Stiggins
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
do
n't
get
no
better
light

ere

said
the

Mr

,
<EOS>
"
it

<EOS>
At
this
supposition
,
the
Reverend
Mr
Stiggins
,
in
evident
consternation
,
gathered
up
his
hat
and
umbrella
,
and
proposed
an
immediate
departure
,
to
which
Mrs
Weller
assented
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
walked
with
them
to
the
lodge
gate
,
and
took
a
dutiful
leave

his

falling

a

<EOS>
Mr
Weller
delivered
this
hurried
abstract
of
his
plot
with
great
vehemence
of
whisper
;
and
then
,
as
if
fearful
of
weakening
the
effect
of
the
tremendous
communication
by
any
further
dialogue
,
he
gave
the
coachman
's
salute
,
and
vanished
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
had
scarcely
recovered
his
usual
composure
of
countenance
,
which
had
been
greatly
disturbed
by
the
secret
communication
of
his
respected
relative
,
when
Mr
Pickwick
accosted
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
"
said
that
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
for
a
walk
round
the
prison

and
I
wish
you
to
attend

<EOS>
I
see
a
prisoner
we
know
coming
this
way
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
smiling
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wich
,
Sir
?
"
inquired
Mr
Weller
;
"
the
gen'l'm'n
vith
<EOS>
the
head
o

hair
,
or
the
interestin
'
captive

?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Neither
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
an
older
friend
of
yours
,
Sam
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
'
mine
,
Sir
?
"
exclaimed
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
recollect
the
gentleman
very
well
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
Sam
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
or
else
you
are
more
unmindful
of
your
old
acquaintances
than
I
think
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
not
a
word
,
Sam
;
not
a
syllable
.
 
<EOS>
Here
he
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Pickwick
spoke
,
Jingle
walked
up
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
less
miserable
than
before
,
being
clad
in
a
half
-
worn
suit
of
clothes
,
which
,
with
Mr
Pickwick
's
assistance
,
had
been
released
from
the
pawnbroker
's
.
 
<EOS>
He
wore
clean
linen
too
,
and
had
had
his
hair
cut
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
pale
and
thin
,
however
;
and
as
he
crept
slowly
up
,
leaning
on
a
stick
,
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
had
suffered
severely
from
illness
and
want
,
and
was
still
very
weak
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
off
his
hat
as
Mr
Pickwick
saluted
him
,
and
seemed
much
humbled
and
abashed
at
the
sight
of
Sam
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
Following
close
at
his
heels
,
came
Mr
Job
Trotter
,
in
the
catalogue
of
whose
vices
,
want
of
faith
and
attachment
to
his
companion
could
at
all
events
find
no
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
still
ragged
and
squalid
,
but
his
face
was
not
quite
so
hollow
as
on
his
first
meeting
with
Mr
Pickwick
,
a
few
days
before
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
took
off
his
hat
to
our
benevolent
old
friend
,
he
murmured
some
broken
expressions
of
gratitude
,
and
muttered
something
about
having
been
saved
from
starving
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
impatiently
interrupting
him
,
"
you
can
follow
with
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
you
,
Mr
Jingle
.
<EOS>
Can
you
walk
without
his
arm
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
sir
---
all
ready
---
not
too
fast
---
legs
shaky
---
head
queer
---
round
and
round
---
earthquaky
sort
of
feeling
---
very
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
,
give
me
your
arm
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
"
replied
Jingle
;
"
wo
n't
indeed
---
rather
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
lean
upon
me
,
I
desire
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Seeing
that
he
was
confused
and
agitated
,
and
uncertain
what
to
do
<EOS>
,
Mr
Pickwick
cut
the
matter
short
by
drawing
the
invalided
stroller
's
arm
through
his
,
and
leading
him
away
,
without
saying
another
word
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
During
the
whole
of
this
time
the
countenance
of
Mr
Samuel
Weller
had
exhibited
an
expression
of
the
most
overwhelming
and
absorbing
astonishment
that
the
imagination
can
portray
.
<EOS>
After
looking
from
Job
to
Jingle
,
and
from
Jingle
to
Job
in
profound
silence
,
he
softly
ejaculated
the
words
,
"
Well
,
I
AM
damn'd
!
"
<EOS>
which
he
repeated
at
least
a
score
of
times
;
after
which
exertion
,
he
appeared
wholly
bereft
of
speech
,
and
again
cast
his
eyes
,
first
upon
the
one
and
then
upon
the
other
,
in
mute
perplexity
and
bewilderment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Sam
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
-
comin
'
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
,
mechanically
following
his
master
;
and
still
he
lifted
not
his
eyes
from
Mr
Job
Trotter
,
who
walked
at
his
side
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Job
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
,
with
his
glued
to
Job
's
countenance
,
ran
up
against
the
people
who
were
walking
about
,
and
fell
over
little
children
,
and
stumbled
against
steps
and
railings
,
without
appearing
at
all
sensible
of
it
,
until
Job
,
looking
stealthily
up
,
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Mr
Weller
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
IS
him
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Sam
;
and
having
established
Job
's
identity
beyond
all
doubt
,
he
smote
his
leg
,
and
vented
his
feelings
in
a
long
,
shrill
whistle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Things
has
altered
with
me
,
sir
,
"
said
Job
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
they
had
,
"
exclaimed
Mr
Weller
,
surveying
his
companion
's
rags
with
undisguised
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
rayther
a
change
for
the
worse
,
Mr
Trotter
,
as
the
gen'l'm'n
said
,
wen
he
got
two
doubtful
shillin
's
and
sixpenn'orth
o
'
pocket
-
pieces
for
a
good
half
-
crown
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
indeed
,
"
replied
Job
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
deception
now
,
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
Tears
,
"
said
Job
,
with
a
look
of
momentary
slyness
---
"
tears
are
not
the
only
proofs
of
distress
,
nor
the
best
ones
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
they
ai
n't
,
"
replied
Sam
expressively
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
may
be
put
on
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
Job
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
they
may
,
"
said
Sam
;
"
some
people
,
indeed
,
has
'em
always
ready
laid
on
,
and
can
pull
out
the
plug
wenever
they
likes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Job
;
"
but
these
sort
of
things
are
not
so
easily
counterfeited
,
Mr
Weller
,
and
it
is
a
more
painful
process
to
get
them
up
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
pointed
to
his
sallow
,
sunken
cheeks
,
and
,
drawing
up
his
coat
sleeve
,
disclosed
an
arm
which
looked
as
if
the
bone
could
be
broken
at
a
touch
,
so
sharp
and
brittle
<EOS>
did
it
appear
,
beneath
its
thin
covering
of
flesh
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
have
you
been
a
-
doin
'
to
yourself
?
"
said
Sam
,
recoiling
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
replied
Job
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothin'
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
doin'
nothing
for
many
weeks
past
,
"
said
Job
;
and
eating
and
drinking
almost
as
little
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sam
took
one
comprehensive
glance
at
Mr
Trotter
's
thin
face
and
wretched
apparel
;
and
then
,
seizing
him
by
the
arm
,
commenced
dragging
him
away
with
great
violence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
,
Mr
Weller
?
"
<EOS>
said
Job
,
vainly
struggling
in
the
powerful
grasp
of
his
old
enemy
.
<EOS>
"
Come
on
,
"
said
Sam
;
"
come
on
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
deigned
no
further
explanation
till
they
reached
the
tap
,
and
then
called
for
a
pot
of
porter
,
which
was
speedily
produced
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
drink
that
up
,
ev'ry
drop
on
it
,
and
then
turn
the
pot
upside
down
,
to
let
me
see
as
you
've
took
the
medicine
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
Mr
Weller
,
"
remonstrated
Job
.
   
<EOS>
"
Down
vith
it
!
"
said
Sam
peremptorily
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
admonished
,
Mr
Trotter
raised
the
pot
to
his
lips
,
and
,
by
gentle
and
almost
imperceptible
degrees
,
tilted
it
into
the
air
.
<EOS>
He
paused
once
,
and
only
once
,
to
draw
a
long
breath
,
but
without
raising
his
face
from
the
vessel
,
which
,
in
a
few
moments
thereafter
,
he
held
out
at
arm
's
length
,
bottom
upward
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
fell
upon
the
ground
but
a
few
particles
of
froth
,
which
slowly
detached
themselves
from
the
rim
,
and
trickled
lazily
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
done
!
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
find
yourself
arter
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Better
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
am
better
,
"
responded
Job
.
   
<EOS>
"
O
'
course
you
air
,
"
said
Sam
argumentatively
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
like
puttin
'
gas
in
a
balloon
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
see
with
the
naked
eye
that
you
gets
stouter
under
the
operation

<EOS>
Wot
<EOS>
do
you
say
to
another
o

the

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not
,
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Job
---
"
much
rather
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
then
,
wot
do
you
say
to
some
wittles
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thanks
to
your
worthy
governor
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Trotter
,
"
we
have
half
a
leg
of
mutton
,
baked
,
at
a
quarter
before
three

with

boiling

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wot

<EOS>
Has
HE
been
a

"
asked
Sam
emphatically
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Job
.
 
<EOS>
"
More
than
that
,
Mr
Weller
;
my
master
being
very
ill
,
he
got
us
a
room
<EOS>
---
we
were
in
a
kennel
before
---
and
paid
for
it
,
Sir
;
and
come
to
look
at
us
,
at
night
,
when
nobody
should
know
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
Job
,
with
real
tears
in
his
eyes
,
for
once
,
"
I
could
serve
that
gentleman
till
I
fell
down
dead
at
his
feet
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
"
said
Sam
,
"
I
'll
trouble
you
,
my
friend
!
 
<EOS>
None
<EOS>
o

that
!
"
   
<EOS>
Job
Trotter
looked
amazed
.
   
<EOS>
"
None
o
'
that
,
I
say
,
young
feller
,
"
repeated
Sam
firmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
man
serves
him
but
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
we
're
upon
it
,
I
'll
let
you
into
another
secret
besides
that
,
"
said
Sam
,
as
he
paid
for
the
beer
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
heerd
,
mind
you
,
or
read
of

story
-
books
,
nor
see
in
picters
,
any
angel
in
tights

not
even
in
spectacles

as
I
remember
,
though
that
may
ha

been
done
for
anythin

<EOS>
I
know
to

---
but
mark
my
vords
,
<EOS>
Job
Trotter
,
he
's
a
reg'lar
thoroughbred
angel
for
all
that
;
and
let
me
see
the
man
as
wenturs
to
tell
me
he
knows
a
better
vun
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
defiance
,
Mr
Weller
buttoned
up
his
change
in
a
side
pocket
,
and
,
with
many
confirmatory
nods
and
gestures
by
the
way
,
proceeded
in
search
of
the
subject
of
discourse
.
   
<EOS>
They
found
Mr
Pickwick
,
in
company
with
Jingle
,
talking
very
earnestly
,
and
not
bestowing
a
look
on
the
groups
who
were
congregated
on
the
racket
-
ground
;
they
were
very
motley
groups
too
,
and
worth
the
looking
at
,
if
it
were
only
in
idle
curiosity
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
Sam
and
his
companion
drew
nigh
,
"
you
will
see
how
your
health
becomes
,
and
think
about
it
meanwhile
.
 
<EOS>
Make
the
statement
out
for
me
when
you
feel
yourself
equal
to
the
task
,
and
I
will
discuss
the
subject
with
you
when
I
have
considered
it
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
go
to
your
room
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
tired
,
and
not
strong
enough
to
be
out
long
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Alfred
Jingle
,
without
one
spark
of
his
old
animation
---
with
nothing
even
of
the
dismal
gaiety
which
he
had
assumed
when
Mr
Pickwick
first
stumbled
on
him
in
his
misery
---
bowed
low
without
speaking
,
and
,
motioning
to
Job
not
to
follow
him
just
yet
,
crept
slowly
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Curious
scene
this
,
is
it
not
,
Sam
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
good
-
humouredly
round
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
<EOS>
much
so
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wonders
"
ull
never
cease
,
"
added
Sam
,
speaking
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
wery
much
mistaken
if
that
,
ere
Jingle
<EOS>
worn't
a
-
doin
somethin'
in
the
water
-
cart
way
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
area
formed
by
the
wall
in
that
part
of
the
Fleet
in
which
Mr
Pickwick
stood
was
just
wide
enough
to
make
a
good
racket
-
court
;
one
side
being
formed
,
of
course
,
by
the
wall
itself
,
and
the
other
by
that
portion
of
the
prison
which
looked
(
or
rather
would
have
looked
,
but
for
the
wall
)
towards
St
Paul
's
Cathedral
.
 
<EOS>
Sauntering
or
sitting
about
,
in
every
possible
attitude
of
listless
idleness
,
were
a
great
number
of
debtors
,
the
major
part
of
whom
were
waiting
in
prison
until
their
day
of
"
going
up
"
before
the
Insolvent
Court
should
arrive
;
while
others
had
been
remanded
for
various
terms
,
which
they
were
idling
away
as
they
best
could
.
 
<EOS>
Some
were
shabby
,
some
were
smart
,
many
dirty
,
a
few
clean
;
but
there
they
all
lounged
,
and
loitered
,
and
slunk
about
with
as
little
spirit
or
purpose
as
the
beasts
in
a
menagerie
.
   
<EOS>
Lolling
from
the
windows
which
commanded
a
view
of
this
promenade
were
a
number
of
persons
,
some
in
noisy
conversation
with
their
acquaintance
below
,
others
playing
at
ball
with
some
adventurous
throwers
outside
,
others
looking
on
at
the
racket
-
players
,
or
watching
the
boys
as
they
cried
the
game
.
 
<EOS>
Dirty
,
slipshod
women
passed
and
repassed
,
on
their
way
to
the
cooking
-
house
in
one
corner
of
the
yard
;
children
screamed
,
and
fought
,
and
played
together
,
in
another
;
the
tumbling
of
the
skittles
,
and
the
shouts
of
the
players
,
mingled
perpetually
with
these
and
a
hundred
other
sounds
;
and
all
was
noise
and
tumult
---
save
in
a
little
miserable
shed
a
few
yards
off
,
<EOS>
where
lay
,
all
quiet
and
ghastly
,
the
body
of
the
Chancery
prisoner
who
had
died
the
night
before
,
awaiting
the
mockery
of
an
inquest
.
 
<EOS>
The
body
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
lawyer
's
term
for
the
restless
,
whirling
mass
of
cares
and
anxieties
,
affections
,
hopes
,
and
griefs
<EOS>
,
that
make
up
the
living
man
.
 
<EOS>
The
law
had
his
body
;
and
there
it
lay
,
clothed
in
grave
-
clothes
,
an
awful
witness
to
its
tender
mercy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
to
see
a
whistling
-
shop
,
Sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Job
Trotter
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
was
Mr
Pickwick
's
counter
inquiry
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
vistlin
'
shop
,
Sir
,
"
interposed
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
,
Sam
?
---
<EOS>
A
bird
-
fancier
's
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
your
heart
,
no
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Job
;
"
a
whistling
-
shop
,
Sir
,
is
where
they
sell
spirits
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Job
Trotter
briefly
explained
here
,
that
all
persons
,
being
prohibited
under
heavy
penalties
from
conveying
spirits
into
debtors
"
prisons
,
and
such
commodities
being
highly
prized
by
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
confined
therein
,
it
had
occurred
to
some
speculative
turnkey
to
connive
,
for
certain
lucrative
considerations
,
at
two
or
three
prisoners
retailing
the
favourite
article
of
gin
,
for
their
own
profit
and
advantage
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
plan
,
you
see
,
Sir
,
has
been
gradually
introduced
into
all
the
prisons
for
debt
,
"
said
Mr
Trotter
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
it
has
this
wery
great
advantage
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
that
the
turnkeys
takes
wery
good
care
to
seize
hold
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
ev'rybody
<EOS>
but
them
as
pays
'em
,
that
attempts
the
willainy
,
and
wen
it
gets
in
the
papers
they
're
applauded
for
their
wigilance
;
so
it
cuts
two
ways
---
frightens
other
people
from
the
trade
,
and
elewates
their
own
characters
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Exactly
so
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
observed
Job
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
are
these
rooms
never
searched
to
ascertain
whether
any
spirits
are
concealed
in
them
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cert'nly
<EOS>
they
are
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Sam
;
"
but
the
turnkeys
knows
beforehand
,
and
gives
the
word
to
the
wistlers
,
and
you
may
wistle
for
it
wen
you
go
to
look
.
"
   
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
Job
had
tapped
at
a
door
,
which
was
opened
by
a
gentleman
with
an
uncombed
head
,
who
bolted
it
after
them
when
they
had
walked
in
,
and
grinned
;
upon
which
Job
grinned
,
and
Sam
also
;
whereupon
Mr
Pickwick
,
thinking
it
might
be
expected
of
him
,
kept
on
smiling
to
the
end
of
the
interview
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
with
the
uncombed
head
appeared
quite
satisfied
with
this
mute
announcement
of
their
business
,
and
,
producing
a
flat
stone
bottle
,
which
might
hold
about
a
couple
of
quarts
,
from
beneath
his
bedstead
,
filled
out
three
glasses
of
gin
,
<EOS>
which
Job
Trotter
and
Sam
disposed
of
in
a
most
workmanlike
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Any
more
?
"
said
the
whistling
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
more
,
"
replied
Job
Trotter
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
paid
,
the
door
was
unbolted
,
and
out
they
came
;
the
uncombed
gentleman
bestowing
a
friendly
nod
upon
Mr
Roker
,
who
happened
to
be
passing
at
the
moment
.
   
<EOS>
From
this
spot
,
Mr
Pickwick
wandered
along
all
the
galleries
,
up
and
down
all
the
staircases
,
and
once
again
round
the
whole
area
of
the
yard
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
body
of
the
prison
population
appeared
to
be
Mivins

Smangle

and

and
the

over

over

<EOS>
There
were
the
same
squalor
,
the
same
turmoil
and
noise
,
the
same
general
characteristics
,
in
every
corner
;
in
the
best
and
the
worst
alike
.
<EOS>
The
whole
place
seemed
restless
and
troubled
;
and
the
people
were
crowding
and
flitting
to
and
fro
,
like
the
shadows
in
an
uneasy
dream
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
enough
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
in
his
little
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
head
aches
with
these
scenes
,
and
my
heart
too
.
 
<EOS>
Henceforth
I
will
be
a
prisoner
in
my
own
room
.
"
   
<EOS>
And
Mr
Pickwick
steadfastly
adhered
to
this
determination
.
<EOS>
For
three
long
months
he
remained
shut
up
,
all
day
;
only
stealing
out
at
night
to
breathe
the
air
,
when
the
greater
part
of
his
fellow
-
prisoners
were
in
bed
or
carousing
in
their
rooms
.
 
<EOS>
His
health
was
beginning
to
suffer
from
the
closeness
of
the
confinement
,
but
neither
the
often
-
repeated
entreaties
of
Perker
and
his
friends
,
nor
the
still
more
frequently
-
repeated
warnings
and
admonitions
of
Mr
Samuel
Weller
,
could
induce
him
to
alter
one
jot
of
his
inflexible
resolution
.

Chapter

<EOS>
Records
a
touching
act
of
delicate
feeling
,
not
unmixed
with
pleasantry
,
achieved
and
performed
by
Messrs
Dodson
and
<EOS>
Fogg
 
It
was
within
a
week
of
the
close
of
the
month
of
July
,
that
a
hackney
cabriolet
,
number
unrecorded
,
was
seen
to
proceed
at
a
rapid
pace
up
Goswell
Street
;
three
people
were
squeezed
into
it
besides
the
driver
,
who
sat
in
his
own
particular
little
dickey
at
the
side
;
over
the
apron
were
hung
two
shawls
,
belonging
to
two
small
vixenish
-
looking
ladies
under
the
apron
;
between
whom
,
compressed
into
a
very
small
compass
,
was
stowed
away
,
a
gentleman
of
heavy
and
subdued
demeanour
,
who
,
whenever
he
ventured
to
make
an
observation
,
was
snapped
up
short
by
one
of
the
vixenish
ladies
before
-
mentioned
.
 
<EOS>
Lastly
,
the
two
vixenish
ladies
and
the
heavy
gentleman
were
giving
the
driver
contradictory
directions
,
all
tending
to
the
one
point
,
that
he
should
stop
at
Mrs
Bardell
's
door
;
which
the
heavy
gentleman
,
in
direct
opposition
to
,
and
defiance
of
,
the
vixenish
ladies
,
contended
was
a
green
door
and
not
a
yellow
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
at
the
house
with
a
green
door
,
driver
,
"
said
the
heavy
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
perwerse
creetur
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
one
of
the
vixenish
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
"
Drive
to
the
'
ouse
with
the
yellow
door
,
cabmin
.
"
   
<EOS>
Upon
this
the
cabman
,
who
in
a
sudden
effort
to
pull
up
at
the
house
with
the
green
door
,
had
pulled
the
horse
up
so
high
that
he
nearly
pulled
him
backward
into
the
cabriolet
,
let
the
animal
's
fore
-
legs
down
to
the
ground
again
,
and
paused
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
vere
am
I
to
pull
up
?
"
inquired
the
driver
.
 
<EOS>
"
Settle
it
among
yourselves
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
ask
is
,
vere
?
"
   
<EOS>
Here
the
contest
was
renewed
with
increased
violence
;
and
the
horse
being
troubled
with
a
fly
on
his
nose
,
the
cabman
humanely
employed
his
leisure
in
lashing
him
about
on
the
head
,
on
the
counter
-
irritation
principle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Most
wotes
carries
the
day

"
said
one
of
the
vixenish
ladies
at
length
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
'
ouse
with
the
yellow
door
,
cabman
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
But
after
the
cabriolet
had
dashed
up
,
in
splendid
style
,
to
the
house
with
the
yellow
door
,
"
making
,
"
as
one
of
the
vixenish
ladies
triumphantly
said
,
"
acterrally
more
noise
than
if
one
had
come
in
one
's
own
carriage
,
"
and
after
the
driver
had
dismounted
to
assist
the
ladies
in
getting
out
,
the
small
round
head
of
Master
Thomas
Bardell
was
thrust
out
of
the
one
-
pair
window
of
a
house
with
a
red
door
,
a
few
numbers
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aggrawatin

<EOS>
"
said
the
vixenish
lady
last
-
mentioned
,
darting
a
withering
glance
at
the
heavy
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
it
's
not
my
fault
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
to

,
you
creetur

"
retorted
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
house
with

red

<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
If
ever
a

was
troubled
with
a
ruffinly
creetur
,
that
takes
a
pride
and
a
pleasure
in
disgracing
his
wife
on
every
possible
occasion
afore
strangers
,
I
am
that
woman
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
,
Raddle
,
"
said
the
other
little
woman
,
who
was
no
other
than
Mrs
Cluppins
.
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
been
a
-
doing
of
?
"
asked
Mr
Raddle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
to

you
brute
,
for
fear
I
should
be
perwoked
to
forgit
my

"
said
Mrs
Raddle
.
   
<EOS>
While
this
dialogue
was
going
on
,
the
driver
was
most
ignominiously
leading
the
horse
,
by
the
bridle
,
up
to
the
house
with
the
red
door
,
which
Master
Bardell
had
already
opened
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
mean
and
low
way
of
arriving
at
a
friend
's
house
!
<EOS>
No
dashing
up
,
with
all
the
fire
and
fury
of
the
animal
;
no
jumping
down
of
the
driver
;
no
loud
knocking
at
the
door
;
no
opening
of
the
apron
with
a
crash
at
the
very
last
moment
,
for
fear
of
the
ladies
sitting
in
a
draught
;
and
then
the
man
handing
the
shawls
out
,
afterwards
,
as
if
he
were
a
private
coachman
!
<EOS>
The
whole
edge
of
the
thing
had
been
taken
off
---
it
was
flatter
than
walking
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Tommy
,
"
said
Mrs
Cluppins
,
"
<EOS>
how
's
your
poor
dear
mother
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

she

"
replied
Master
Bardell
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
in
the
front
parlour
,
all
ready
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
ready
too

I

"
 
<EOS>
Here
Master
Bardell
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
jumped
off
and
on
the
bottom
step
of
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
anybody
else

said
Mrs

,
arranging
her
pelerine

<EOS>
"

replied

"

<EOS>
"
Drat

said

"
He

<EOS>
Here

"
   
<EOS>
"
Well

said
Master

.
   
<EOS>
"
Who

"
said
Mrs

,
in
an
insinuating
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
Mrs
Rogers
is
a

goin

"
replied
Master
Bardell
,
opening
his
eyes
very
wide
as
he
delivered
the
intelligence
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
?
 
<EOS>
The
lady
as
has
taken
the
lodgings

"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mrs
Cluppins
.
   
<EOS>
Master
Bardell
put
his
hands
deeper
down
into
his
pockets
,
and
nodded
exactly
thirty
-
five
times
,
to
imply
that
it
was
the
lady
-
lodger
,
and
no
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
us
!
"
said
Mrs
Cluppins
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
a
party
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
if
you
knew
what
was
in
the
cupboard
,
you
'd
say
so
,
"
replied
Master
Bardell
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
there
,
Tommy

"
said
Mrs
Cluppins
coaxingly
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
tell
ME

Tommy
,
I

"
<EOS>
"
No

I
wo

"
replied
Master
Bardell
,
shaking
his
head
,
and
applying
himself
to
the
bottom
step
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Drat
the
child
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Mrs
Cluppins
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
prowokin
'
little
wretch
it
is

<EOS>
Come

Tommy

tell
your

"
   
<EOS>
"
Mother
said
I

"
rejoined
Master
Bardell
,
"
I
'm
a

goin
'
to
have
some
,
I
am
.
"
 
<EOS>
Cheered
by
this
prospect
,
the
precocious
boy
applied
himself
to
his
infantile
treadmill
,
with
increased
vigour
.
   
<EOS>
The
above
examination
of
a
child
of
tender
years
took
place
while
Mr
and
Mrs
Raddle
and
the
cab
-
driver
were
having
an
altercation
concerning
the
fare
,
which
,
terminating
at
this
point
in
favour
of
the
cabman
,
Mrs
Raddle
came
up
tottering
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lauk
,
Mary
Ann
!
<EOS>
what
's
the
matter
?
"
said
Mrs
Cluppins
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
put
me
all
over
in
such
a
tremble
,
Betsy
,
"
replied
Mrs
Raddle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Raddle
ai
n't
like
a
man
;
he
leaves
everythink
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
scarcely
fair
upon
the
unfortunate
Mr
Raddle
,
who
had
been
thrust
aside
by
his
good
lady
in
the
commencement
of
the
dispute
,
and
peremptorily
commanded
to
hold
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
opportunity
of
defending
himself
,
however
,
for
Mrs
Raddle
gave
unequivocal
signs
of
fainting
;
which
,
being
perceived
from
the
parlour
window
,
Mrs
Bardell
,
Mrs
Sanders
,
the
lodger
,
and
the
lodger
's
servant
,
darted
precipitately
out
,
and
conveyed
her
into
the
house
,
all
talking
at
the
same
time
,
and
giving
utterance
to
various
expressions
of
pity
and
condolence
,
as
if
she
were
one
of
the
most
suffering
mortals
on
earth
.
 
<EOS>
Being
conveyed
into
the
front
parlour
,
she
was
there
deposited
on
a
sofa
;
and
the
lady
from
the
first
floor
running
up
to
the
first
floor
,
returned
with
a
bottle
of
sal
-
volatile
,
which
,
holding
Mrs
Raddle
tight
round
the
neck
,
she
applied
in
all
womanly
kindness
and
pity
to
her
nose
,
until
that
lady
with
many
plunges
and
struggles
was
fain
to
declare
herself
decidedly
better
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs
Rogers
,
"
I
know
what
her
feelin
's
is
,
too
well
.
"
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
so
do
I
,
"
said
Mrs
Sanders
;
and
then
all
the
ladies
moaned
in
unison
,
and
said
they
knew
what
it
was
,
and
they
pitied
her
from
their
hearts
,
they
did
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
lodger
's
little
servant
,
who
was
thirteen
years
old
and
three
feet
high
,
murmured
her
sympathy
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
what
's
been
the
matter
?
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
what
has
decomposed
you
,
ma'am
?
"
inquired
Mrs
Rogers
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
a
good
deal
flurried
,
"
replied
Mrs
Raddle
,
in
a
reproachful
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Thereupon
the
ladies
cast
indignant
glances
at
Mr
Raddle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
fact
is
,
"
said
that
unhappy
gentleman
,
stepping
forward
,
"
when
we
alighted
at
this
door
,
a
dispute
arose
with
the
driver
of
the
cabrioily
---
"
A
loud
scream
from
his
wife
,
at
the
mention
of
this
word
,
rendered
all
further
explanation
inaudible
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
leave
us
to
bring
her
round
,
Raddle
,
"
said
Mrs
Cluppins
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
'll
never
get
better
as
long
as
you
're
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
All
the
ladies
concurred
in
this
opinion
;
so
Mr
Raddle
was
pushed
out
of
the
room
,
and
requested
to
give
himself
an
airing
in
the
back
yard
.
 
<EOS>
Which
he
did
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
when
Mrs
Bardell
announced
to
him
with
a
solemn
face
that
he
might
come
in
now
,
but
that
he
must
be
very
careful
how
he
behaved
towards
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
he
did
n't
mean
to
be
unkind
;
but
Mary
Ann
was
very
far
from
strong
,
and
,
if
he
did
n't
take
care
,
he
might
lose
her
when
he
least
expected
it
,
which
would
be
a
very
dreadful
reflection
for
him
afterwards
;
and
so
on
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
,
Mr
Raddle
heard
with
great
submission
,
and
presently
returned
to
the
parlour
in
a
most
lamb
-
like
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mrs
Rogers
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
,
"
you
've
never
been
introduced
,
I
declare
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Raddle
,
ma'am
;
Mrs
Cluppins
,
ma'am
;
Mrs
Raddle
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Which
is
Mrs
Cluppins
's
sister
,
"
suggested
Mrs
Sanders
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
indeed
!
"
said
Mrs
Rogers
graciously
;
for
she
was
the
lodger
,
and
her
servant
was
in
waiting
,
<EOS>
so
she
was
more
gracious
than
intimate
,
in
right
of
her
position
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
indeed
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Raddle
smiled
sweetly
,
Mr
Raddle
bowed
,
and
Mrs
Cluppins
said
,
"
she
was
sure
she
was
very
happy
to
have
an
opportunity
of
being
known
to
a
lady
which
she
had
heerd
so
much
in
favour
of
,
as
Mrs
Rogers
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
compliment
which
the
last
-
named
lady
acknowledged
with
graceful
condescension
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr
Raddle
,
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
;
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
you
ought
to
feel
very
much
honoured
at

the
only

many
ladies
all
the
way

Spaniards

Do

Rogers

"
<EOS>
"
Oh

certainly

replied
Mrs
Rogers
;
after
whom
all
the
other
ladies
responded
,
"
Oh

certainly

"
<EOS>
Of
course
I
feel
it
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Raddle
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
and
evincing
a
slight
tendency
to
brighten
up
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
said
,
as
we
was
a
-
coming
along
in
the
cabrioily
---
"
   
At
the
recapitulation
of
the
word
which
awakened
so
many
painful
recollections
,
Mrs
Raddle
applied
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
again
,
and
uttered
a
half
-
suppressed
scream
;
so
that
Mrs
Bardell
frowned
upon
Mr
Raddle
,
to
intimate
that
he
had
better
not
say
anything
more
,
and
desired
Mrs
Rogers
's
servant
,
with
an
air
,
to
"
put
the
wine
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
the
signal
for
displaying
the
hidden
treasures
of
the
closet
,
which
comprised
sundry
plates
of
oranges
and
biscuits
,
and
a
bottle
of
old
crusted
port
---
<EOS>
that
at
one
-
and
-
nine
---
with
another
of
the
celebrated
East
India
sherry
at
fourteen
-
pence
,
which
were
all
produced
in
honour
of
the
lodger
,
and
afforded
unlimited
satisfaction
to
everybody
.
 
<EOS>
After
great
consternation
had
been
excited
in
the
mind
of
Mrs
Cluppins
,
by
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
Tommy
to
recount
how
he
had
been
cross
-
examined
regarding
the
cupboard
then
in
action
(
which
was
fortunately
nipped
in
the
bud
by
his
imbibing
half
a
glass
of
the
old
crusted
"
the
wrong
way
,
"
and
thereby
endangering
his
life
for
some
seconds
)
,
the
party
walked
forth
in
quest
of
a
Hampstead
stage
.
<EOS>
This
was
soon
found
,
and
in
a
couple
of
hours
they
all
arrived
safely
in
the
Spaniards
Tea
-
gardens
,
where
the
luckless
Mr
Raddle
's
very
first
act
nearly
occasioned
his
good
lady
a
relapse
;
it
being
neither
more
nor
less
than
to
order
tea
for
seven
,
whereas
(
as
the
ladies
one
and
all
remarked
)
,
what
could
have
been
easier
than
for
Tommy
to
have
drank
out
of
anybody
's
cup
---
or
everybody
's
,
if
that
was
all
---
when
the
waiter
was
n't
looking
,
which
would
have
saved
one
head
of
tea
,
and
the
tea
just
as
good
!
   
<EOS>
However
,
there
was
no
help
for
it
,
and
the
tea
-
tray
came
,
with
seven
cups
and
saucers
,
and
bread
-
and
-
butter
on
the
same
scale
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Bardell
was
unanimously
voted
into
the
chair
,
and
Mrs
Rogers
being
stationed
on
her
right
hand
,
and
Mrs
Raddle
on
her
left
,
the
meal
proceeded
with
great
merriment
and
success
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
sweet
the
country
is
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
sighed
Mrs
Rogers
;
"
I
almost
wish
I
lived
in
it
always
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
would
n't
like
that
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
Mrs
Bardell
,
rather
hastily
;
for
it
was
not
at
all
advisable
,
with
reference
to
the
lodgings
,
to
encourage
such
notions
;
"
you
would
n't
like
it
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
should
think
you
was
a
deal
too
lively
and
sought
after
,
to
be
content
with
the
country
,
ma'am
,
"
said
little
Mrs
Cluppins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
am
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
am
,
"
sighed
the
first
-
floor
lodger
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
lone
people
as
have
got
nobody
to
care
for
them
,
or
take
care
of
them
,
or
as
have
been
hurt
in
their
mind
,
or
that
kind
of
thing
,
"
observed
Mr
Raddle
,
plucking
up
a
little
cheerfulness
,
and
looking
round
,
"
the
country
is
all
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
The
country
for
a
wounded
spirit
,
they
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
of
all
things
in
the
world
that
the
unfortunate
man
could
have
said
,
any
would
have
been
preferable
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
Mrs
Bardell
burst
into
tears
,
and
requested
to
be
led
from
the
table
instantly
;
upon
which
the
affectionate
child
began
to
cry
too
,
most
dismally
.
   
<EOS>
"
Would
anybody
believe
,
ma'am
,
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Raddle
,
turning
fiercely
to
the
first
-
floor
lodger
,
"
that
a
woman
could
be
married
to
such
a
unmanly
creetur
,
which
can
tamper
with
a
woman
's
feelings
as
he
does
,
every
hour
in
the
day
,
ma'am
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
remonstrated
Mr
Raddle
,
"
I
did
n't
mean
anything
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
mean
!
"
repeated
Mrs
Raddle
,
with
great
scorn
and
contempt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
the
sight
on
you
,
<EOS>
you
brute
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
flurry
yourself
,
Mary
Ann
,
"
interposed
Mrs
Cluppins
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
really
must
consider
yourself
,
my
dear
,
which
you
never
do
.
 
<EOS>
Now
go
away
,
Raddle
<EOS>
,
there
's
a
good
soul
,
or
you
'll
only
aggravate
her
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
take
your
tea
by
yourself
,
Sir
,
indeed
,
"
said
Mrs
Rogers
,
again
applying
the
smelling
-
bottle
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sanders
,
who
,
according
to
custom
,
was
very
busy
with
the
bread
-
and
-
butter
,
expressed
the
same
opinion
,
and
Mr
Raddle
quietly
retired
.
   
<EOS>
After
this
,
there
was
a
great
hoisting
up
of
Master
Bardell
,
who
was
rather
a
large
size
for
hugging
,
into
his
mother
's
arms
,
in
which
operation
he
got
his
boots
in
the
tea
-
board
,
and
occasioned
some
confusion
among
the
cups
and
saucers
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
description
of
fainting
fits
,
which
is
contagious
among
ladies
,
seldom
lasts
long
;
so
when
he
had
been
well
kissed
,
and
a
little
cried
over
,
Mrs
Bardell
recovered
,
set
him
down
again
,
wondering
how
she
could
have
been
so
foolish
,
and
poured
out
some
more
tea
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
at
this
moment
,
that
the
sound
of
approaching
wheels
was
heard
,
and
that
the
ladies
,
looking
up
,
saw
a
hackney
-
coach
stop
at
the
garden
gate
.
   
<EOS>
"
More
company
!
"
said
Mrs
Sanders
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
gentleman
,
"
said
Mrs
Raddle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
if
it
ai
n't
Mr
Jackson
,
the
young
man
from
Dodson
and
Fogg
's
!
"
cried
Mrs
Bardell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
gracious
!
 
<EOS>
Surely
Mr
Pickwick
ca
n't
have
paid
the
damages
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Or
hoffered
marriage
!
"
said
Mrs
Cluppins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
how
slow
the
gentleman
is
,
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Rogers
.
<EOS>
"
Why
does
n't
he
make
haste
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
lady
spoke
these
words
,
Mr
Jackson
turned
from
the
coach
where
he
had
been
addressing
some
observations
to
a
shabby
man
in
black
leggings
,
who
had
just
emerged
from
the
vehicle
with
a
thick
ash
stick
in
his
hand
,
and
made
his
way
to
the
place
where
the
ladies
were
seated
;
winding
his
hair
round
the
brim
of
his
hat
,
as
he
came
along
.
"
<EOS>
Is
anything
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
Has
anything
taken
place
,
Mr
Jackson
?
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
eagerly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
whatever
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
Mr
Jackson
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
de
do
,
ladies
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
to
ask
pardon
,
ladies
,
for
intruding
---
but
the
law
,
ladies
---
the
law
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
apology
Mr
Jackson
smiled
,
made
a
comprehensive
bow
,
and
gave
his
hair
another
wind
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Rogers
whispered
Mrs
Raddle
that
he
was
really
an
elegant
young
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
called
in
Goswell
Street
,
"
resumed
Mr
Jackson
,
"
and
hearing
that
you
were
here
,
from
the
slavey
,
took
a
coach
and
came
on
.
<EOS>
Our
people
want
you
down
in
the
city
directly
,
Mrs
Bardell
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
!
"
ejaculated
that
lady
,
starting
at
the
sudden
nature
of
the
communication
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr
Jackson
,
biting
his
lip
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
important
and
pressing
business
,
which
ca
n't
be
postponed
on
any
account
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Dodson
expressly
said
so
to
me
,
and
so
did
Fogg
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
kept
the
coach
on
purpose
for
you
to
go
back
in
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
very
strange
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Bardell
.
   
<EOS>
The
ladies
agreed
that
it
WAS
very
strange
,
but
were
unanimously
of
opinion
that
it
must
be
very
important
,
or
Dodson
&
Fogg
would
never
have
sent
;
and
further
,
that
the
business
being
urgent
,
she
ought
to
repair
to
Dodson
&
Fogg
<EOS>
's
without
any
delay
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
certain
degree
of
pride
and
importance
about
being
wanted
by
one
's
lawyers
in
such
a
monstrous
hurry
,
that
was
by
no
means
displeasing
to
Mrs
Bardell
,
especially
as
it
might
be
reasonably
supposed
to
enhance
her
consequence
in
the
eyes
of
the
first
-
floor
lodger
.
 
<EOS>
She
simpered
a
little
,
affected
extreme
vexation
and
hesitation
,
and
at
last
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
she
supposed
she
must
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
wo
n't
you
refresh
yourself
after
your
walk
,
Mr
Jackson
?
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
persuasively
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
really
there
ai
n't
much
time
to
lose
,
"
replied
Jackson
;
"
and
I
've
got
a
friend
here
<EOS>
,
"
he
continued
,
looking
towards
the
man
with
the
ash
stick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
ask
your
friend
to
come
here
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pray
ask
your
friend
here
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
thank'ee
,
I
'd
rather
not
,
"
said
Mr
Jackson
,
with
some
embarrassment
of
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
not
much
used
to
ladies
"
society
,
and
it
makes
him
bashful
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
'll
order
the
waiter
to
deliver
him
anything
short
,
he
wo
n't
drink
it
off
at
once
,
wo
n't
he
!
<EOS>
---
only
try
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jackson
's
fingers
wandered
playfully
round
his
nose
at
this
portion
of
his
discourse
,
to
warn
his
hearers
that
he
was
speaking
ironically
.
   
<EOS>
The
waiter
was
at
once
despatched
to
the
bashful
gentleman
,
and
the
bashful
gentleman
took
something
;
Mr
Jackson
also
took
something
,
and
the
ladies
took
something
,
for
hospitality
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jackson
then
said
he
was
afraid
it
was
time
to
go
;
upon
which
,
Mrs
Sanders
,
Mrs
Cluppins
,
and
Tommy
(
who
it
was
arranged
should
accompany
Mrs
Bardell
,
leaving
the
others
to
Mr
Raddle
's
protection
)
,
got
into
the
coach
.
   
<EOS>
"
Isaac
,
"
said
Jackson
,
as
Mrs
Bardell
prepared
to
get
in
,
looking
up
at
the
man
with
the
ash
stick
,
who
was
seated
on
the
box
,
smoking
a
cigar
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
Mrs
Bardell
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
<EOS>
know'd
<EOS>
that
long
ago
,
"
said
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Bardell
got
in
,
Mr
Jackson
got
in
after
her
,
and
away
they
drove
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Bardell
could
not
help
ruminating
on
what
Mr
Jackson
's
friend
had
said
.
 
<EOS>
Shrewd
creatures
,
those
lawyers
.
<EOS>
Lord
bless
us
<EOS>
,
how
they
find
people
out
!
   
<EOS>
"
Sad
thing
about
these
costs
of
our
people
's
,
ai
n't
it
,
"
said
Jackson
,
when
Mrs
Cluppins
and
Mrs
Sanders
had
fallen
asleep
;
"
your
bill
of
costs
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
sorry
they
ca
n't
get
them
,
"
replied
Mrs
Bardell
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
law
gentlemen
do
these
things
on
speculation
,
why
you
must
get
a
loss
now
and
then
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
gave
them
a
COGNOVIT
for
the
amount
of
your
costs
,
after
the
trial
,
I
'm
told
!
"
said
Jackson
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
a
matter
of
form
,
"
replied
Mrs
Bardell
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
replied
Jackson
drily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
a
matter
of
form
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
On
they
drove
,
and
Mrs
Bardell
fell
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
awakened
,
after
some
time
,
by
the
stopping
of
the
coach
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
us
!
"
said
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
Are
we
at
Freeman
's
Court
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
're
not
going
quite
so
far
,
"
replied
Jackson
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
the
goodness
to
step
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Bardell
,
not
yet
thoroughly
awake
,
complied
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
curious
place
:
a
large
wall
,
with
a
gate
in
the
middle
,
and
a
gas
-
light
burning
inside
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
ladies
,
"
cried
the
man
with
the
ash
stick
,
looking
into
the
coach
,
and
shaking
Mrs
Sanders
to
wake
her
,
"
Come
!
"
<EOS>
Rousing
her
friend
,
Mrs
Sanders
alighted
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Bardell
,
leaning
on
Jackson
's
arm
,
and
leading
Tommy
by
the
hand
,
had
already
entered
the
porch
.
 
<EOS>
They
followed
.
   
<EOS>
The
room
they
turned
into
was
even
more
odd
-
looking
than
the
porch
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
number
of
men
standing
about
!
 
<EOS>
And
they
stared
so
!
   
<EOS>
"
What
place
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mrs
Bardell
,
pausing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Only
one
of
our
public
offices
,
"
replied
Jackson
,
hurrying
her
through
a
door
,
and
looking
round
to
see
that
the
other
women
were
following
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
sharp
,
Isaac
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Safe
and
sound
,
"
replied
the
man
with
the
ash
stick
.
 
<EOS>
The

swung
heavily
after
them
,
and
they
descended
a
small
flight
of
steps
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
we
are
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
All
right
and
tight
<EOS>
,
Mrs
Bardell

"
said
Jackson
,
looking
exultingly
round
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
said
Mrs
Bardell
,
with
a
palpitating
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
Just
this
,
"
replied
Jackson
,
drawing
her
a
little
on
one
side
;
"
do
n't
be
frightened
,
Mrs
Bardell
.
 
<EOS>
There
never
was
a
more
delicate
man
than
Dodson
,
ma'am
,
or
a
more
humane
man
than
Fogg
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
their
duty
in
the
way
of
business
,
to
take
you
in
execution
for
them
costs
;
but
they
were
anxious
to
spare
your
feelings
as
much
as
they
could
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
comfort
it
must
be
,
to
you
,
to
think
how
it
's
been
done
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
Fleet

ma'am

<EOS>
Wish
you
good

night

Mrs
Bardell

<EOS>
Good

night

"
   
<EOS>
As
Jackson
hurried
away
in
company
with
the
man
with
the
ash
stick
another
man
,
with
a
key
in
his
hand
,
who
had
been
looking
on
,
led
the
bewildered
female
to
a
second
short
flight
of
steps
leading
to
a
doorway
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Bardell
screamed
violently
;
Tommy
roared
;
Mrs
Cluppins
shrunk
within
herself
;
and
Mrs
Sanders
made
off
,
without
more
ado
.
 
<EOS>
For
there
stood
the
injured
Mr
Pickwick
,
taking
his
nightly
allowance
of
air
;
and
beside
him
leant
Samuel
Weller
,
who
,
seeing
Mrs
Bardell
,
took
his
hat
off
with
mock
reverence
,
while
his
master
turned
indignantly
on
his
heel
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
bother
the
woman
,
"
said
the
turnkey
to
Weller
;
"
she
's
just
come
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
prisoner

<EOS>
"
said
Sam
,
quickly
replacing
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who

the

<EOS>
What

<EOS>
Speak
up

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dodson

replied
the
man
;
"

<EOS>
"
Here

shouted
Sam
,
dashing
into
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Run

<EOS>
Hooray

"
   
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
reply
to
these
inquiries
,
for
Job
had
started
furiously
off
,
the
instant
he
received
his
commission
,
and
Mrs
Bardell
had
fainted
in
real
downright
earnest

Mr

Mr
Pickwick
's
benevolence
proves
stronger
than
his
obstinacy
 
Job
Trotter
,
abating
nothing
of
his
speed
,
ran
up
Holborn
,
sometimes
in
the
middle
of
the
road
,
sometimes
on
the
pavement
,
sometimes
in
the
gutter
,
as
the
chances
of
getting
along
varied
with
the
press
of
men
,
women
,
children
,
and
coaches
,
in
each
division
of
the
thoroughfare
,
and
,
regardless
of
all
obstacles
stopped
not
for
an
instant
until
he
reached
the
gate
of
Gray
's
Inn
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
the
expedition
he
had
used
,
however
,
the
gate
had
been
closed
a
good
half
-
hour
when
he
reached
it
,
and
by
the
time
he
had
discovered
Mr
Perker
's
laundress
,
who
lived
with
a
married
daughter
,
who
had
bestowed
her
hand
upon
a
non
-
resident
waiter
,
who
occupied
the
one
-
pair
of
some
number
in
some
street
closely
adjoining
to
some
brewery
somewhere
behind
Gray
's
Inn
Lane
,
it
was
within
fifteen
minutes
of
closing
the
prison
for
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Lowten
had
still
to
be
ferreted
out
from
the
back
parlour
of
the
Magpie
and
Stump
;
and
Job
had
scarcely
accomplished
this
object
,
and
communicated
Sam
Weller
's
message
,
when
the
clock
struck
ten
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
said
Lowten
,
"
it
's
too
late
now
.
 
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
get
in
to
-
night
;
you
've
got
the
key
of
the
street
,
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
me
,
"
replied
Job
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
sleep
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
But
wo
n't
it
be
better
to
see
Mr
Perker
to
-
night
,
so
that
we
may
be
there
,
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
responded
Lowten
,
after
a
little
consideration
,
"
if
it
was
in
anybody
else
's
case
,
Perker
would
n't
be
best
pleased
at
my
going
up
to
his
house
;
but
<EOS>
as
it
's
Mr
Pickwick
's
,
I
think
I
may
venture
to
take
a
cab
and
charge
it
to
the
office
.
"
 
<EOS>
Deciding
on
this
line
of
conduct
,
Mr
Lowten
took
up
his
hat
,
and
begging
the
assembled
company
to
appoint
a
deputy
-
chairman
during
his
temporary
absence
,
led
the
way
to
the
nearest
coach
-
stand
.
<EOS>
Summoning
the
cab
of
most
promising
appearance
,
he
directed
the
driver
to
repair
to
Montague
Place
,
Russell
Square
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Perker
had
had
a
dinner
-
party
that
day
,
as
was
testified
by
the
appearance
of
lights
in
the
drawing
-
room
windows
,
the
sound
of
an
improved
grand
piano
,
and
an
improvable
cabinet
voice
issuing
therefrom
,
and
a
rather
overpowering
smell
of
meat
which
pervaded
the
steps
and
entry
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
a
couple
of
very
good
country
agencies
happening
to
come
up
to
town
,
at
the
same
time
,
an
agreeable
little
party
had
been
got
together
to
meet
them
,
comprising
Mr
Snicks
,
the
Life
Office
Secretary
,
Mr
Prosee
,
the
eminent
counsel
,
three
solicitors
,
one
commissioner
of
bankrupts
,
a
special
pleader
from
the
Temple
,
a
small
-
eyed
peremptory
young
gentleman
,
his
pupil
,
who
had
written
a
lively
book
about
the
law
of
demises
,
with
a
vast
quantity
of
marginal
notes
and
references
;
and
several
other
eminent
and
distinguished
personages
.
<EOS>
From
this
society
,
little
Mr
Perker
detached
himself
,
on
his
clerk
being
announced
in
a
whisper
;
and
repairing
to
the
dining
-
room
,
there
found
Mr
Lowten
and
Job
Trotter
looking
very
dim
and
shadowy
by
the
light
of
a
kitchen
candle
,
which
the
gentleman
who
condescended
to
appear
in
plush
shorts
and
cottons
for
a
quarterly
stipend
,
had
,
with
a
becoming
contempt
for
the
clerk
and
all
things
appertaining
to
"
the
office
,
"
placed
upon
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Lowten
,
"
said
little
Mr
Perker
,
shutting
the
door
,
"
what
's
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
No
important
letter
come
in
a
parcel
,
is
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Lowten
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
messenger
from
Mr
Pickwick
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
From
Pickwick
,
eh
?
"
said
the
little
man
,
turning
quickly
to
Job
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
what
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dodson
and
Fogg
have
taken
Mrs
Bardell
in
execution
for
her
costs
,
Sir
,
"
said
Job
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
exclaimed
Perker
,
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
reclining
against
the
sideboard
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Job
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
seems
they
got
a
cognovit
out
of
her
,
for
the
amount
of
'em
,
directly
after
the
trial
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
By
Jove
!
<EOS>
"
said
Perker
,
taking
both
hands
out
of
his
pockets
,
and
striking
the
knuckles
of
his
right
against
the
palm
of
his
left
,
emphatically
,
"
those
are
the
cleverest
scamps
I
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
sharpest
practitioners
I
ever
knew
,
Sir
,
"
observed
Lowten
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sharp
!
"
echoed
Perker
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
knowing
where
to
have
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
Sir
,
there
is
not
,
"
replied
Lowten
;
and
then
,
both
master
and
man
pondered
for
a
few
seconds
,
with
animated
countenances
,
as
if
they
were
reflecting
upon
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
ingenious
discoveries
that
the
intellect
of
man
had
ever
made
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
had
in
some
measure
recovered
from
their
trance
of
admiration
,
Job
Trotter
discharged
himself
of
the
rest
of
his
commission
.
 
<EOS>
Perker
nodded
his
head
thoughtfully
,
and
pulled
out
his
watch
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
ten
precisely
,
I
will
be
there
,
"
said
the
little
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sam
is
quite
right
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
him
so
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
take
a
glass
of
wine
,
Lowten
?
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
mean
yes
,
I
think
,
"
said
the
little
man
,
turning
to
the
sideboard
for
a
decanter
and
glasses
.
   
<EOS>
As
Lowten
DID
mean
yes
,
he
said
no
more
on
the
subject
,
but
inquired
of
Job
,
in
an
audible
whisper
,
whether
the
portrait
of
Perker
,
which
hung
opposite
the
fireplace
,
was
n't
a
wonderful
likeness
,
to
which
Job
of
course
replied
that
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
The
wine
being
by
this
time
poured
out
,
Lowten
drank
to
Mrs
Perker
and
the
children
,
and
Job
to
Perker
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
in
the
plush
shorts
and
cottons
considering
it
no
part
of
his
duty
to
show
the
people
from
the
office
out
,
consistently
declined
to
answer
the
bell
,
and
they
showed
themselves
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
attorney
betook
himself
to
his
drawing
-
room
,
the
clerk
to
the
Magpie
and
Stump
,
and
Job
to
Covent
Garden
Market
to
spend
the
night
in
a
vegetable
basket
.
   
<EOS>
Punctually
at
the
appointed
hour
next
morning
,
the
good
-
humoured
little
attorney
tapped
at
Mr
Pickwick
's
door
,
which
was
opened
with
great
alacrity
by
Sam
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Perker
,
sir
,
"
said
Sam
,
announcing
the
visitor
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
was
sitting
at
the
window
in
a
thoughtful
attitude
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wery
glad
you
've
looked
in
accidentally
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
rather
think
the
gov'nor
wants
to
have
a
word
and
a
half
with
you
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Perker
bestowed
a
look
of
intelligence
on
Sam
,
intimating
that
he
understood
he
was
not
to
say
he
had
been
sent
for
;
and
beckoning
him
to
approach
,
whispered
briefly
in
his
ear
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
that
'
ere
,
Sir
?
"
said
Sam
,
starting
back
in
excessive
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
Perker
nodded
and
smiled
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Samuel
Weller
looked
at
the
little
lawyer
,
then
at
Mr
Pickwick
,
then
at
the
ceiling
,
then
at
Perker
again
;
grinned
,
laughed
outright
,
and
finally
,
catching
up
his
hat
from
the
carpet
,
without
further
explanation
,
disappeared
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
does
this
mean
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
at
Perker
with
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
has
put
Sam
into
this
extraordinary
state
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
nothing
,
nothing
,
"
replied
Perker
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
my
dear
Sir
,
draw
up
your
chair
to
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
deal
to
say
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
papers
are
those
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
the
little
man
deposited
on
the
table
a
small
bundle
of
documents
tied
with
red
tape
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
papers
in
Bardell
and
Pickwick
,
"
replied
Perker
,
undoing
the
knot
with
his
teeth
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
grated
the
legs
of
his
chair
against
the
ground
;
and
throwing
himself
into
it
,
folded
his
hands
and
looked
sternly
 
---
if
Mr
Pickwick
ever
could
look
sternly
---
at
his
legal
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
like
to
hear
the
name
of
the
cause
?
"
said
the
little
man
,
still
busying
himself
with
the
knot
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
do
not
indeed
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sorry
for
that
,
"
resumed
Perker
,
"
because
it
will
form
the
subject
of
our
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
that
the
subject
should
be
never
mentioned
between
us
,
Perker
,
"
interposed
Mr
Pickwick
hastily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pooh
,
pooh
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
said
the
little
man
,
untying
the
bundle
,
and
glancing
eagerly
at
Mr
Pickwick
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
mentioned
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
come
here
on
purpose
.
<EOS>
Now
,
are
you
ready
to
hear
what
I
have
to
say
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Sir
?
 
<EOS>
No
hurry
;
if
you
are
not
,
I
can
wait
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
this
morning
's
paper
here
.
 
<EOS>
Your
time
shall
be
mine
.
 
<EOS>
There
!
"
 
<EOS>
Hereupon
,
the
little
man
threw
one
leg
over
the
other
,
and
made
a
show
of
beginning
to
read
with
great
composure
and
application
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
a
sigh
,
but
softening
into
a
smile
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
Say
what
you
have
to
say
;
it
's
the
old
story
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
a
difference
,
my
dear
Sir
;
with
a
difference
,
"
rejoined
Perker
,
deliberately
folding
up
the
paper
and
putting
it
into
his
pocket
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Bardell
,
the
plaintiff
in
the
action
,
is
within
these
walls
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
was
Mr
Pickwick
's
reply
,
   
"
Very
good
,
"
retorted
Perker
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
know
how
she
comes
here
,
I
suppose
;
I
mean
on
what
grounds
,
and
at
whose
suit
?
"
   
"
Yes
;
at
least
I
have
heard
Sam
's
account
of
the
matter
,

said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
affected
carelessness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
's
account
of
the
matter
,
"
replied
Perker
,
"
is
,
I
will
venture
to
say
,
a
perfectly
correct
one
.
 
<EOS>
Well
now
,
my
dear
Sir
,
the
first
question
I
have
to
ask
,
is
,
whether
this
woman
is
to
remain
here
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
To
remain
here
!
"
echoed
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
remain
here
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
rejoined
Perker
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
looking
steadily
at
his
client
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
ask
me
?
"
said
that
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
rests
with
Dodson
and
Fogg
;
you
know
that
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
the
kind
,
"
retorted
Perker
firmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
does
NOT
rest
with
Dodson
and
Fogg
;
you
know
the
men
,
my
dear
Sir
,
as
well
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
rests
solely
,
wholly
,
and
entirely
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
me
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mr
Pickwick
,
rising
nervously
from
his
chair
,
and
reseating
himself
directly
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
The
little
man
gave
a
double
-
knock
on
the
lid
of
his
snuff
-
box
,
opened
it
,
took
a
great
pinch
,
shut
it
up
again
,
and
repeated
the
words
,
"
With
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
resumed
the
little
man
,
who
seemed
to
gather
confidence
from
the
snuff
---
"
I
say
,
that
her
speedy
liberation
or
perpetual
imprisonment
rests
with
you
,
and
with
you
alone
.
<EOS>
Hear
me
out
,
my
dear
Sir
,
if
you
please
,
and
do
not
be
so
very
energetic
,
<EOS>
for
it
will
only
put
you
into
a
perspiration
and
do
no
good
<EOS>
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
continued
Perker
,
checking
off
each
position
on
a
different
finger
,
as
he
laid
it
down
---
"
I
say
that
nobody
but
you
can
rescue
her
from
this
den
of
wretchedness
;
and
that
you
can
only
do
that
,
by
paying
the
costs
of
this
suit
---
both
of
plaintive
and
defendant
---
into
the
hands
of
these
Freeman
Court
sharks
.
 
<EOS>
Now
pray
be
quiet
,
my
dear
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
whose
face
had
been
undergoing
most
surprising
changes
during
this
speech
,
and
was
evidently
on
the
verge
of
a
strong
burst
of
indignation
,
calmed
his
wrath
as
well
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
Perker
,
strengthening
his
argumentative
powers
with
another
pinch
of
snuff
,
proceeded
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
the
woman
,
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
By
paying
the
costs
,
you
can
obtain
a
full
release
and
discharge
from
the
damages
;
and
further
---
this
I
know
is
a
far
greater
object
of
consideration
with
you
,
my
dear
sir
---
a
voluntary
statement
,
under
her
hand
,
in
the
form
of
a
letter
to
me
,
that
this
business
was
,
from
the
very
first
,
fomented
,
and
encouraged
,
and
brought
about
,
by
these
men
,
Dodson
and
Fogg
;
that
she
deeply
regrets
ever
having
been
the
instrument
of
annoyance
or
injury
to
you
;
and
that
she
entreats
me
to
intercede
with
you
,
and
implore
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
pay
her
costs
for
her
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
indignantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
valuable
document
,
indeed
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
"
if
"
in
the
case
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
said
Perker
triumphantly
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
the
very
letter
I
speak
of
.
 
<EOS>
Brought
to
my
office
by
another
woman
at
nine
o'clock
this
morning
,
before
I
had
set
foot
in
this
place
,
or
held
any
communication
with
Mrs
Bardell
,
upon
my
honour
.
"
 
<EOS>
Selecting
the
letter
from
the
bundle
,
the
little
lawyer
laid
it
at
Mr
Pickwick
's
elbow
,
and
took
snuff
for
two
consecutive
minutes
,
without
winking
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
this
all
you
have
to
say
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
mildly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
,
"
replied
Perker
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
undertake
to
say
,
at
this
moment
,
whether
the
wording
of
the
cognovit
,
the
nature
of
the
ostensible
consideration
,
and
the
proof
we
can
get
together
about
the
whole
conduct
of
the
suit
,
will
be
sufficient
to
justify
an
indictment
for
conspiracy
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
not
,
my
dear
Sir
;
they
are
too
clever
for
that
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
mean
to
say
,
however
,
that
the
whole
facts
,
taken
together
,
will
be
sufficient
to
justify
you
,
in
the
minds
of
all
reasonable
men
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
dear
Sir
,
I
put
it
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
This
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
,
or
whatever
it
may
be
 
<EOS>
---
take
it
in
round
numbers
---
is
nothing
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
A
jury
had
decided
against
you
;
well
,
their
verdict
is
wrong
,
but
still
they
decided
as
they
thought
right
,
and
it
IS
against
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
now
an
opportunity
,
on
easy
terms
,
of
placing
yourself
in
a
much
higher
position
than
you
ever
could
,
by
remaining
here
;
which
would
only
be
imputed
,
by
people
who
did
n't
know
you
,
to
sheer
dogged
,
wrongheaded
,
brutal
obstinacy
;
nothing
else
,
my
dear
Sir
,
believe
me
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
hesitate
to
avail
yourself
of
it
,
when
it
restores
you
to
your
friends
,
your
old
pursuits
,
your
health
and
amusements
;
when
it
liberates
your
faithful
and
attached
servant
,
whom
you
otherwise
doom
to
imprisonment
for
the
whole
of
your
life
;
and
above
all
,
when
it
enables
you
to
take
the
very
magnanimous
revenge
---
which
I
know
,
my
dear
sir
,
is
one
after
your
own
heart
---
of
releasing
this
woman
from
a
scene
of
misery
and
debauchery
,
to
which
no
man
should
ever
be
consigned
,
if
I
had
my
will
,
but
the
infliction
of
which
on
any
woman
,
is
even
more
frightful
and
barbarous
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
ask
you
,
my
dear
sir
,
not
only
as
your
legal
adviser
,
but
as
your
very
true
friend
,
will
you
let
slip
the
occasion
of
attaining
all
these
objects
,
and
doing
all
this
good
,
for
the
paltry
consideration
of
a
few
pounds
finding
their
way
into
the
pockets
of
a
couple
of
rascals
,
to
whom
it
makes
no
manner
of
difference
,
except
that
the
more
they
gain
,
the
more
they
'll
seek
,
and
so
the
sooner
be
led
into
some
piece
of
knavery
that
must
end
in
a
crash
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
these
considerations
to
you
,
my
dear
Sir
,
very
feebly
and
imperfectly
,
but
I
ask
you
to
think
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Turn
them
over
in
your
mind
as
long
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
wait
here
most
patiently
for
your
answer
.
"
   
<EOS>
Before
Mr
Pickwick
could
reply
,
before
Mr
Perker
had
taken
one
twentieth
part
of
the
snuff
with
which
so
unusually
long
an
address
imperatively
required
to
be
followed
up
,
there
was
a
low
murmuring
of
voices
outside
,
and
then
a
hesitating
knock
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
,
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
had
been
evidently
roused
by
his
friend
's
appeal
;
"
what
an
annoyance
that
door
is
!
<EOS>
Who
is
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Me
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Sam
Weller
,
putting
in
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
speak
to
you
just
now
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
engaged
at
this
moment
,
Sam
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Beg
your
pardon
,
Sir
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
here
's
a
lady
here
,
Sir
,
as
says
she
's
somethin'
wery
partickler
to
disclose
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
see
any
lady
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
whose
mind
was
filled
with
visions
of
Mrs
Bardell
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
make
too
sure
o
'
that
,
Sir
,
"
urged
Mr
Weller
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
you
know'd
who
was
near
,
sir
<EOS>
,
I
rayther
think
you
'd
change
your
note
;
as
the
hawk
remarked
to
himself
vith
a
cheerful
laugh
,
<EOS>
ven
<EOS>
he
heerd
the
robin
-
redbreast
a

singin
'
round
the
corner
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
see
her
,
Sir
?
"
asked
Mr
Weller
,
holding
the
door
in
his
hand
as
if
he
had
some
curious
live
animal
on
the
other
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
must
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
at
Perker
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
all
in
to
begin
!
"
cried
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sound
the
gong
,
draw
up
the
curtain
,
and
enter
the
two
conspiraytors
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Sam
Weller
spoke
,
he
threw
the
door
open
,
and
there
rushed
tumultuously
into
the
room
,
Mr
Nathaniel
Winkle
,
leading
after
him
by
the
hand
,
the
identical
young
lady
who
at
Dingley
Dell
had
worn
the
boots
with
the
fur
round
the
tops
,
and
who
,
now
a
very
pleasing
compound
of
blushes
and
confusion
,
and
lilac
silk
,
and
a
smart
bonnet
,
and
a
rich
lace
veil
,
looked
prettier
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Arabella
Allen
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
,
rising
from
his
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
,
dropping
on
his
knees
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Winkle
.
<EOS>
Pardon
,
my
dear
friend
,
pardon
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
could
scarcely
believe
the
evidence
of
his
senses
,
and
perhaps
would
not
have
done
so
,
but
for
the
corroborative
testimony
afforded
by
the
smiling
countenance
of
Perker
,
and
the
bodily
presence
,
in
the
background
,
of
Sam
and
the
pretty
housemaid
;
who
appeared
to
contemplate
the
proceedings
with
the
liveliest
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mr
Pickwick
!
"
said
Arabella
,
in
a
low
voice
,
as
if
alarmed
at
the
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
forgive
my
imprudence
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
returned
no
verbal
response
to
this
appeal
;
but
he
took
off
his
spectacles
in
great
haste
,
and
seizing
both
the
young
lady
's
hands
in
his
,
kissed
her
a
great
number
of
times
---
perhaps
a
greater
number
than
was
absolutely
necessary
---
and
then
,
still
retaining
one
of
her
hands
,
told
Mr
Winkle
he
was
an
audacious
young
dog
,
and
bade
him
get
up
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
Mr
Winkle
,
who
had
been
for
some
seconds
scratching
his
nose
with
the
brim
of
his
hat
,
in
a
penitent
manner
,
did
;
whereupon
Mr
Pickwick
slapped
him
on
the
back
several
times
,
and
then
shook
hands
heartily
with
Perker
,
who
,
not
to
be
behind
-
hand
in
the
compliments
of
the
occasion
,
saluted
both
the
bride
and
the
pretty
housemaid
with
right
good
-
will
,
and
,
having
wrung
Mr
,
Winkle
's
hand
most
cordially
,
wound
up
his
demonstrations
of
joy
by
taking
snuff
enough
to
set
any
half
-
dozen
men
with
ordinarily
-
constructed
noses
,
a
-
sneezing
for
life
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
girl
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
how
has
all
this
come
about
?
 
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Sit
down
,
and
let
me
hear
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
How
well
she
looks
,
does
n't
she
,
Perker
?
<EOS>
"
added
Mr
Pickwick
,
surveying
Arabella
's
face
with
a
look
of
as
much
pride
and
exultation
,
as
if
she
had
been
his
daughter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Delightful
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
replied
the
little
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
not
a
married
man
myself
,
I
should
be
disposed
to
envy
you
,
you
dog
.
"
<EOS>
Thus
expressing
himself
,
the
little
lawyer
gave
Mr
Winkle
a
poke
in
the
chest
,
which
that
gentleman
reciprocated
;
after
which
they
both
laughed
very
loudly
,
but
not
so
loudly
as
Mr
Samuel
Weller
,
who
had
just
relieved
his
feelings
by
kissing
the
pretty
housemaid
under
cover
of
the
cupboard
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
never
be
grateful
enough
to
you
,
Sam
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Arabella
,
with
the
sweetest
smile
imaginable
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
forget
your
exertions
in
the
garden
at
Clifton
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
n't
say
nothin'
wotever
about
it
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
assisted
natur
,
ma'am
;
as
the
doctor
said
to
the
boy
's
mother
,
after
he
'd
bled
him
to
death
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
my
dear
,
sit
down
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
cutting
short
these
compliments
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
then
;
how
long
have
you
been
married
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
Arabella
looked
bashfully
at
her
lord
and
master
,
who
replied
,
"
Only
three
days
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
three
days
,
eh
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
have
you
been
doing
these
three
months
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
to
be
sure
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Perker
;
"
come
,
account
for
this
idleness
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
Mr
Pickwick
's
only
astonishment
is
,
that
it
was
n't
all
over
,
months
ago
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
the
fact
is
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
,
looking
at
his
blushing
young
wife
,
"
that
I
could
not
persuade
Bella
to
run
away
,
for
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
had
persuaded
her
,
it
was
a
long
time
more
before
we
could
find
an
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
had
to
give
a
month
's
warning
,
too
,
before
she
could
leave
her
place
next
door
,
and
we
could
n't
possibly
have
done
it
without
her
assistance
.
"
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
by
this
time
had
resumed
his
spectacles
,
and
was
looking
from
Arabella
to
Winkle
,
and
from
Winkle
to
Arabella
,
with
as
much
delight
depicted
in
his
countenance
as
warmheartedness
and
kindly
feeling
can
communicate
to
the
human
face
---
"
upon
my
word
!
<EOS>
you
seem
to
have
been
very
systematic
in
your
proceedings
.
 
<EOS>
And
is
your
brother
acquainted
with
all
this
,
my
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
no
,
"
replied
Arabella
,
changing
colour
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
Mr
Pickwick
,
he
must
only
know
it
from
you
---
from
your
lips
alone
.
<EOS>
He
is
so
violent
,
so
prejudiced
,
and
has
been
so
---
so
anxious
in
behalf
of
his
friend
,
Mr
,
Sawyer
,
"
added
Arabella
,
looking
down
,
"
that
I
fear
the
consequences
dreadfully
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
Perker
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
take
this
matter
in
hand
for
them
,
my
dear
sir
.
 
<EOS>
These
young
men
will
respect
you
,
when
they
would
listen
to
nobody
else
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
prevent
mischief
,
my
dear
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
Hot
blood
,
hot
blood
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
the
little
man
took
a
warning
pinch
,
and
shook
his
head
doubtfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
forget
,
my
love
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
gently
,
"
you
forget
that
I
am
a
prisoner
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
I
do
not
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
replied
Arabella
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
have
forgotten
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
ceased
to
think
how
great
your
sufferings
must
have
been
in
this
shocking
place
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
hoped
that
what
no
consideration
for
yourself
would
induce
you
to
do
,
a
regard
to
our
happiness
might
.
 
<EOS>
If
my
brother
hears
of
this
,
first
,
from
you
,
I
feel
certain
we
shall
be
reconciled
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
my
only
relation
in
the
world
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
unless
you
plead
for
me
,
I
fear
I
have
lost
even
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
done
wrong
,
very
,
very
wrong
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Here
poor
Arabella
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
,
and
wept
bitterly
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
nature
was
a
good
deal
worked
upon
,
by
these
same
tears
;
but
when
Mrs
Winkle
,
drying
her
eyes
,
took
to
coaxing
and
entreating
in
the
sweetest
tones
of
a
very
sweet
voice
,
he
became
particularly
restless
,
and
evidently
undecided
how
to
act
,
as
was
evinced
by
sundry
nervous
rubbings
of
his
spectacle
-
glasses
,
nose
,
tights
,
head
,
and
gaiters
.
   
<EOS>
Taking
advantage
of
these
symptoms
of
indecision
,
Mr
Perker
(
to
whom
,
it
appeared
,
the
young
couple
had
driven
straight
that
morning
)
urged
with
legal
point
and
shrewdness
that
Mr
Winkle
,
senior
,
was
still
unacquainted
with
the
important
rise
in
life
's
flight
of
steps
which
his
son
had
taken
;
that
the
future
expectations
of
the
said
son
depended
entirely
upon
the
said
Winkle
,
senior
,
continuing
to
regard
him
with
undiminished
feelings
of
affection
and
attachment
,
which
it
was
very
unlikely
he
would
,
if
this
great
event
were
long
kept
a
secret
from
him
;
that
Mr
Pickwick
,
repairing
to
Bristol
to
seek
Mr
Allen
,
might
,
with
equal
reason
,
repair
to
Birmingham
to
seek
Mr
Winkle
,
senior
;
lastly
,
that
Mr
Winkle
,
senior
,
had
good
right
and
title
to
consider
Mr
Pickwick
as
in
some
degree
the
guardian
and
adviser
of
his
son
,
and
that
it
consequently
behoved
that
gentleman
,
and
was
indeed
due
to
his
personal
character
,
to
acquaint
the
aforesaid
Winkle
,
senior
,
personally
,
and
by
word
of
mouth
,
with
the
whole
circumstances
of
the
case
,
and
with
the
share
he
had
taken
in
the
transaction
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
and
Mr
Snodgrass
arrived
,
most
opportunely
,
in
this
stage
of
the
pleadings
,
and
as
it
was
necessary
to
explain
to
them
all
that
had
occurred
,
together
with
the
various
reasons
pro
and
con
,
the
whole
of
the
arguments
were
gone
over
again
,
after
which
everybody
urged
every
argument
in
his
own
way
,
and
at
his
own
length
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
at
last
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
fairly
argued
and
remonstrated
out
of
all
his
resolutions
,
and
being
in
imminent
danger
of
being
argued
and
remonstrated
out
of
his
wits
,
caught
Arabella
in
his
arms
,
and
declaring
that
she
was
a
very
amiable
creature
,
and
that
he
did
n't
know
how
it
was
,
but
he
had
always
been
very
fond
of
her
from
the
first
,
said
he
could
never
find
it
in
his
heart
to
stand
in
the
way
of
young
people
's
happiness
,
and
they
might
do
with
him
as
they
pleased
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
's
first
act
,
on
hearing
this
concession
,
was
to
despatch
Job
Trotter
to
the
illustrious
Mr
Pell
,
with
an
authority
to
deliver
to
the
bearer
the
formal
discharge
which
his
prudent
parent
had
had
the
foresight
to
leave
in
the
hands
of
that
learned
gentleman
,
in
case
it
should
be
,
at
any
time
,
required
on
an
emergency
;
his
next
proceeding
was
,
to
invest
his
whole
stock
of
ready
-
money
in
the
purchase
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
gallons
of
mild
porter
,
which
he
himself
dispensed
on
the
racket
-
ground
to
everybody
who
would
partake
of
it
;
this
done
,
he
hurra'd
<EOS>
in
divers
parts
of
the
building
until
he
lost
his
voice
,
and
then
quietly
relapsed
into
his
usual
collected
and
philosophical
condition
.
   
<EOS>
At
three
o'clock
that
afternoon
,
Mr
Pickwick
took
a
last
look
at
his
little
room
,
and
made
his
way
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
through
the
throng
of
debtors
who
pressed
eagerly
forward
to
shake
him
by
the
hand
,
until
he
reached
the
lodge
steps
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
here
,
to
look
about
him
,
and
his
eye
lightened
as
he
did
so
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
the
crowd
of
wan
,
emaciated
faces
,
he
saw
not
one
which
was
not
happier
for
his
sympathy
and
charity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perker
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
beckoning
one
young
man
towards
him
,
"
<EOS>
this
is
Mr
Jingle
,
whom
I
spoke
to
you
about
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
replied
Perker
,
looking
hard
at
Jingle
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
me
again
,
young
man
,
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
may
live
to
remember
and
feel
deeply
,
what
I
shall
have
to
communicate
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jingle
bowed
respectfully
,
trembled
very
much
as
he
took
Mr
Pickwick
's
proffered
hand
,
and
withdrew
.
   
<EOS>
"
Job
you
know
,
I
think
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
presenting
that
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
rascal
,
"
replied
<EOS>
Perker
good
-
humouredly
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
after
your
friend
,
and
be
in
the
way
to

morrow
at
one

<EOS>
Do
you
hear
?
<EOS>
Now
,
is
there
anything
more
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
delivered
the
little
parcel
I
gave
you
for
your
old
landlord
,
Sam
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
Sir

"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
bust
out
a

cryin

,
Sir

and
said
you
wos
wery
gen'rous

and
he
only
wished
you
could
have
him
innockilated
for
a
gallopin

consumption
,
for
his
old
friend
as
had
lived
here
<EOS>
so
long
wos
dead

and
he
'd
noweres
to
look
for
another
.
"
<EOS>
"
Poor
fellow
,
poor
fellow
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
my
friends
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Pickwick
uttered
this
adieu
,
the
crowd
raised
a
loud
shout
.
 
<EOS>
Many
among
them
were
pressing
forward
to
shake
him
by
the
hand
again
,
when
he
drew
his
arm
through
Perker
's
,
and
hurried
from
the
prison
,
far
more
sad
and
melancholy
,
for
the
moment
,
than
when
he
had
first
entered
it
.
 
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
how
many
sad
and
unhappy
beings
had
he
left
behind
!
   
<EOS>
A
happy
evening
was
that
for
at
least
one
party
in
the
George
and
Vulture
;
and
light
and
cheerful
were
two
of
the
hearts
that
emerged
from
its
hospitable
door
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
The
owners
thereof
were
Mr
Pickwick
and
Sam
Weller
,
the
former
of
whom
was
speedily
deposited
inside
a
comfortable
post
-
coach
,
with
a
little
dickey
behind
,
in
which
the
latter
mounted
with
great
agility
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
called
out
Mr
Weller
to
his
master
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sam
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
thrusting
his
head
out
of
the
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
them
horses
had
been
three
months
and
better
in
the
Fleet

"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Sam

"
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wy
,
Sir

exclaimed
Mr

,
rubbing
his
hands
,
"
how
they
would
go

Chapter

<EOS>
Relates
how
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
the
assistance
of
Samuel
Weller
,
essayed
to
soften
the
heart
of
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
,
and
to
mollify
the
wrath
of
Mr
Robert
Sawyer
 
Mr
Ben
Allen
and
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
<EOS>
sat
together
in
the
little
surgery
behind
the
shop
,
discussing
minced
veal
and
future
prospects
,
when
the
discourse
,
not
unnaturally
,
turned
upon
the
practice
acquired
by
Bob
the
aforesaid
,
and
his
present
chances
of
deriving
a
competent
independence
from
the
honourable
profession
to
which
he
had
devoted
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Which
,
I
think
,
"
observed
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
pursuing
the
thread
of
the
subject
---
"
which
,
I
think
,
Ben
,
are
rather
dubious
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
rather
dubious
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
at
the
same
time
sharpening
his
intellect
with
a
draught
of
beer
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
dubious
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
chances
,
"
responded
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
forgot
,
"
said
Mr
Ben
Allen
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
beer
has
reminded
me
that
I
forgot
,
Bob
---
<EOS>
yes
;
they
ARE
dubious
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
wonderful
how
the
poor
people
patronise
me
,
"
said
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
reflectively
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
knock
me
up
,
at
all
hours
of
the
night
;
they
take
medicine
to
an
extent
which
I
should
have
conceived
impossible
;
they
put
on
blisters
and
leeches
with
a
perseverance
worthy
of
a
better
cause
;
they
make
additions
to
their
families
,
in
a
manner
which
is
quite
awful
.
 
<EOS>
Six
of
those
last
-
named
little
promissory
notes
,
all
due
on
the
same
day
,
Ben
,
and
all
intrusted
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
gratifying
,
is
n't
it
?
"
said
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
holding
his
plate
for
some
more
minced
veal
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
very
,
"
replied
Bob
;
"
only
not
quite
so
much
so
as
the
confidence
of
patients
with
a
shilling
or
two
to
spare
would
be
.
<EOS>
This
business
was
capitally
described
in
the
advertisement

<EOS>
It
is
a
practice
,
a
very
extensive
practice

and
that
's
all

<EOS>
"
Bob
,
"
said
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
laying
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
visage
of
his
friend
,
"
Bob
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is

"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
You

make
yourself

as
little
delay

added
Bob

,
in
legal
phraseology
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Exactly
so
,
"
said
Ben
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
it
when
she
comes
of
age

or
marries

<EOS>
She
wants
a
year

coming
of
age

if
you
plucked
up
a

she
need
n't
want
a

<EOS>
"
She
's
a
very
charming

delightful
creature

quoth
<EOS>
Mr
Robert
Sawyer
,
in
reply
;
"
and
has
only
one
fault
that
I
know
of

Ben

<EOS>
It
happens
,
unfortunately
,
that
that
single
blemish
is
a
want
of
taste

<EOS>
She
do
n't
like

<EOS>
"
It
's
my
opinion

she
do

know
what
she
does
like

said
Mr
Ben
Allen
contemptuously
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not

remarked
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
my
opinion

she
does
know
what

that
's
of
more
importance

<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
"
said
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
setting
his
teeth
together
,

speaking
more
like
a
savage
warrior
who
fed
on
raw
wolf
's
flesh
which
he
carved
with
his
fingers
,
than
a
peaceable
young
gentleman
who
ate
minced
veal
with
a
knife
and
fork
---
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
knew
whether
any
rascal
really
has
been
tampering
with
her

attempting
to
engage
her

<EOS>
I
think
I
should
assassinate
him

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'd
put
a
bullet
in

out

said
Mr

,
stopping
in
the
course
of
a
long
draught
of
beer
,
and
looking
malignantly
out
of
the
porter
pot
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
that
did
n't
do
his
business

I
'd
extract
it
afterwards

kill
him
that
way

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
gazed
abstractedly
on
his
friend
for
some
minutes
in
silence
,
and
then
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
You

blank

<EOS>
No

<EOS>
Because
I
saw

replied
Mr

<EOS>
"
You
shall

twenty
-
four
hours
older
,
"
retorted
Ben
,
with
desperate
calmness
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
shall
have
you
,
or
I
'll
know
the
reason
why
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
exert
my
authority
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
"
we
shall
see
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
,
my
friend
,
"
replied
Mr
Ben
Allen
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
He
paused
for
a
few
seconds
,
and
added
in
a
voice
broken
by
emotion
,
"
You
have
loved
her
from
a
child
,
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
You
loved
her
when
we
were
boys
at
school
together
,
and
,
even
then
,
she
was
wayward
and
slighted
your
young
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
recollect
,
with
all
the
eagerness
of
a
child
's
love
,
one
day
pressing
upon
her
acceptance
,
two
small
caraway
-
seed
biscuits
and
one
sweet
apple
,
neatly
folded
into
a
circular
parcel
with
the
leaf
of
a
copy
-
book
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
slighted
that
,
I
think
?
"
said
Ben
Allen
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
did
,
"
rejoined
Bob
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
said
I
had
kept
the
parcel
so
long
in
the
pockets
of
my
corduroys
,
that
the
apple
was
unpleasantly
warm
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
remember
,
"
said
Mr
Allen
gloomily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Upon
which
we
ate
it
ourselves
,
in
alternate
bites
.
"
   
<EOS>
Bob
Sawyer
intimated
his
recollection
of
the
circumstance
last
alluded
to
,
by
a
melancholy
frown
;
and
the
two
friends
remained
for
some
time
absorbed
,
each
in
his
own
meditations
.
   
<EOS>
While
these
observations
were
being
exchanged
between
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
and
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
;
and
while
the
boy
in
the
gray
livery
,
marvelling
at
the
unwonted
prolongation
of
the
dinner
,
cast
an
anxious
look
,
from
time
to
time
,
towards
the
glass
door
,
distracted
by
inward
misgivings
regarding
the
amount
of
minced
veal
which
would
be
ultimately
reserved
for
his
individual
cravings
;
there
rolled
soberly
on
through
the
streets
of
Bristol
,
a
private
fly
,
painted
of
a
sad
green
colour
,
drawn
by
a
chubby
sort
of
brown
horse
,
and
driven
by
a
surly
-
looking
man
with
his
legs
dressed
like
the
legs
of
a
groom
,
and
his
body
attired
in
the
coat
of
a
coachman
.
 
<EOS>
Such
appearances
are
common
to
many
vehicles
belonging
to
,
and
maintained
by
,
old
ladies
of
economic
habits
;
and
in
this
vehicle
sat
an
old
lady
who
was
its
mistress
and
proprietor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Martin
!
"
said
the
old
lady
,
calling
to
the
surly
man
,
out
of
the
front
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
"
said
the
surly
man
,
touching
his
hat
to
the
old
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Sawyer
's
,
"
said
the
old
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
there
,
"
said
the
surly
man
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
lady
nodded
the
satisfaction
which
this
proof
of
the
surly
man
's
foresight
imparted
to
her
feelings
;
and
the
surly
man
giving
a
smart
lash
to
the
chubby
horse
,
they
all
repaired
to
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
's
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
Martin
!
"
said
the
old
lady
,
when
the
fly
stopped
at
the
door
of
Mr
Robert
Sawyer
,
late
Nockemorf
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ask
the
lad
to
step
out
,
and
mind
the
horse
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
going
to
mind
the
horse
myself
,
"
said
Martin
,
laying
his
whip
on
the
roof
of
the
fly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
permit
it
,
on
any
account
,
"
said
the
old
lady
;
"
your
testimony
will
be
very
important
,
and
I
must
take
you
into
the
house
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
stir
from
my
side
during
the
whole
interview
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hear
,
"
replied
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
;
what
are
you
stopping
for
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
replied
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
the
surly
man
leisurely
descended
from
the
wheel
,
on
which
he
had
been
poising
himself
on
the
tops
of
the
toes
of
his
right
foot
,
and
having
summoned
the
boy
in
the
gray
livery
,
opened
the
coach
door
,
flung
down
the
steps
,
and
thrusting
in
a
hand
enveloped
in
a
dark
wash
-
leather
glove
,
pulled
out
the
old
lady
with
as
much
unconcern
in
his
manner
as
if
she
were
a
bandbox
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
exclaimed
the
old
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
flurried
,
now
I
have
got
here
,
Martin
,
that
I
'm
all
in
a
tremble
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Martin
coughed
behind
the
dark
wash
-
leather
gloves
,
but
expressed
no
sympathy
;
so
the
old
lady
,
composing
herself
,
trotted
up
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
's
steps
,
and
Mr
Martin
followed
.
<EOS>
Immediately
on
the
old
lady
's
entering
the
shop
,
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
and
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
who
had
been
putting
the
spirits
-
and
-
water
out
of
sight
,
and
upsetting
nauseous
drugs
to
take
off
the
smell
of
the
tobacco
smoke
,
issued
hastily
forth
in
a
transport
of
pleasure
and
affection
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
aunt
,
"
exclaimed
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
"
how
kind
of
you
to
look
in
upon
us
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sawyer
,
aunt
;
my
friend
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
whom
I
have
spoken
to
you
about
,
regarding
---
you
know
,
aunt
.
"
<EOS>
And
here
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
who
was
not
at
the
moment
extraordinarily
sober
,
added
the
word
"
Arabella
,
"
in
what
was
meant
to
be
a
whisper
,
but
which
was
an
especially
audible
and
distinct
tone
of
speech
which
nobody
could
avoid
hearing
,
if
anybody
were
so
disposed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Benjamin
,
"
said
the
old
lady
,
struggling
with
a
great
shortness
of
breath
,
and
trembling
from
head
to
foot
,
"
do
n't
be
alarmed
,
my
dear
,
but
I
think
I
had
better
speak
to
Mr
Sawyer
,
alone
,
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Only
for
one
moment
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bob
,
"
said
Mr
Allen
,
"
will
you
take
my
aunt
into
the
surgery
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
responded
Bob
,
in
a
most
professional
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Step
this
way
,
my
dear
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
frightened
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
be
able
to
set
you
to
rights
in
a
very
short
time
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
my
dear
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
Now
then
!
"
 
With
this
,
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
having
handed
the
old
lady
to
a
chair
,
shut
the
door
,
drew
another
chair
close
to
her
,
and
waited
to
hear
detailed
the
symptoms
of
some
disorder
from
which
he
saw
in
perspective
a
long
train
of
profits
and
advantages
.
   
<EOS>
The
first
thing
the
old
lady
did
,
was
to
shake
her
head
a
great
many
times
,
and
began
to
cry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nervous
,
"
said
Bob
Sawyer
complacently
.
 
<EOS>
"
Camphor
-
julep
and
water
three
times
a
day
,
and
composing
draught
at
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
to
begin
,
Mr
Sawyer
,
"
said
the
old
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
very
painful
and
distressing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
begin
,
ma'am
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
anticipate
all
you
would
say
.
 
<EOS>
The
head
is
in
fault
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
think
it
was
the
heart
,
"
said
the
old
lady
,
with
a
slight
groan
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
the
slightest
danger
of
that
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
Bob
Sawyer
.
<EOS>
"
The
stomach
is
the
primary
cause
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Mr
Sawyer
!
"
exclaimed
the
old
lady
,
starting
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
the
least
doubt
of
it
,
ma'am
,
"
rejoined
Bob
,
looking
wondrous
wise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Medicine
,
in
time
,
my
dear
ma'am
,
would
have
prevented
it
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Sawyer
,
"
said
the
old
lady
,
more
flurried
than
before
,
"
this
conduct
is
either
great
impertinence
to
one
in
my
situation
,
Sir
,
or
it
arises
from
your
not
understanding
the
object
of
my
visit
.
<EOS>
If
it
had
been
in
the
power
of
medicine
,
or
any
foresight
I
could
have
used
,
to
prevent
what
has
occurred
,
I
should
certainly
have
done
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
better
see
my
nephew
at
once
,
"
said
the
old
lady
,
twirling
her
reticule
indignantly
,
and
rising
as
she
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
moment
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bob
Sawyer
;
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
I
have
not
understood
you
.
 
<EOS>
What
IS
the
matter
,
ma'am
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
niece
,
Mr
Sawyer
,
"
said
the
old
lady
:
"
your
friend
's
sister
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bob
,
all
impatience
;
for
the
old
lady
,
although
much
agitated
,
spoke
with
the
most
tantalising
deliberation
,
as
old
ladies
often
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Left
my
home
,
Mr
Sawyer
,
three
days
ago
,
on
a
pretended
visit
to
my
sister
,
another
aunt
of
hers
,
who
keeps
the
large
boarding
-
school
,
just
beyond
the
third
mile
-
stone
,
where
there
is
a
very
large
laburnum
-
tree
and
an
oak
gate
,
"
said
the
old
lady
,
stopping
in
this
place
to
dry
her
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
devil
take
the
laburnum
-
tree
,
ma'am
!
"
<EOS>
said
Bob
,
quite
forgetting
his
professional
dignity
in
his
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
"
Get
on
a
little
faster
;
put
a
little
more
steam
on
,
ma'am
,
pray
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
morning
,
"
said
the
old
lady
slowly
---
"
<EOS>
this
morning
,
she
---
"
   
"
She
came
back
,
ma'am
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Bob
,
with
great
animation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
she
come
back
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
she
did
not
;
she
wrote
,
"
replied
the
old
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
she
say
?
"
inquired
Bob
eagerly
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
said
,
Mr
Sawyer
,
"
replied
the
old
lady
---
"
and
it
is
this
I
want
to
prepare
Benjamin
's
mind
for
,
gently
and
by
degrees
;
she
said
that
she
was
---
 
<EOS>
I
have
got
the
letter
in
my
pocket
,
Mr
Sawyer
,
but
my
glasses
are
in
the
carriage
,
and
I
should
only
waste
your
time
if
I
attempted
to
point
out
the
passage
to
you
,
without
them
;
she
said
,
in
short
,
Mr
Sawyer
,
that
she
was
married
.
"
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
,
or
rather
shouted
,
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Married
,
"
repeated
the
old
lady
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
stopped
to
hear
no
more
;
but
darting
from
the
surgery
into
the
outer
shop
,
cried
in
a
stentorian
voice
,
"
Ben
,
my
boy
,
she
's
bolted
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
who
had
been
slumbering
behind
the
counter
,
with
his
head
half
a
foot
or
so
below
his
knees
,
no
sooner
heard
this
appalling
communication
,
than
he
made
a
precipitate
rush
at
Mr
Martin
,
and
,
twisting
his
hand
in
the
neck
-
cloth
of
that
taciturn
servitor
,
expressed
an
obliging
intention
of
choking
him
where
he
stood
.
 
<EOS>
This
intention
,
with
a
promptitude
often
the
effect
of
desperation
,
he
at
once
commenced
carrying
into
execution
,
with
much
vigour
and
surgical
skill
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Martin
,
who
was
a
man
of
few
words
and
possessed
but
little
power
of
eloquence
or
persuasion
,
submitted
to
this
operation
with
a
very
calm
and
agreeable
expression
of
countenance
,
for
some
seconds
;
finding
,
however
,
that
it
threatened
speedily
to
lead
to
a
result
which
would
place
it
beyond
his
power
to
claim
any
wages
,
board
or
otherwise
,
in
all
time
to
come
,
he
muttered
an
inarticulate
remonstrance
and
felled
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
As
that
gentleman
had
his
hands
entangled
in
his
cravat
,
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
follow
him
to
the
floor
.
<EOS>
There
they
both
lay
struggling
,
when
the
shop
door
opened
,
and
the
party
was
increased
by
the
arrival
of
two
most
unexpected
visitors
,
to
wit
,
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Samuel
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
The
impression
at
once
produced
on
Mr
Weller
's
mind
by
what
he
saw
,
was
,
that
Mr
Martin
was
hired
by
the
establishment
of
Sawyer
,
late
Nockemorf
,
to
take
strong
medicine
,
or
to
go
into
fits
and
be
experimentalised
upon
,
or
to
swallow
poison
now
and
then
with
the
view
of
testing
the
efficacy
of
some
new
antidotes
,
or
to
do
something
or
other
to
promote
the
great
science
of
medicine
,
and
gratify
the
ardent
spirit
of
inquiry
burning
in
the
bosoms
of
its
two
young
professors
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
without
presuming
to
interfere
,
Sam
stood
perfectly
still
,
and
looked
on
,
as
if
he
were
mightily
interested
in
the
result
of
the
then
pending
experiment
.
<EOS>
Not
so
,
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
He
at
once
threw
himself
on
the
astonished
combatants
,
with
his
accustomed
energy
,
and
loudly
called
upon
the
bystanders
to
interpose
.
   
<EOS>
This
roused
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
who
had
been
hitherto
quite
paralysed
by
the
frenzy
of
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
With
that
gentleman
's
assistance
,
Mr
Pickwick
raised
Ben
Allen
to
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Martin
finding
himself
alone
on
the
floor
,
got
up
,
and
looked
about
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Allen
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
what
is
the
matter
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
Sir
!
"
replied
Mr
Allen
,
with
haughty
defiance
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
at
Bob
Sawyer
.
<EOS>
"
Is
he
unwell
?
"
   
<EOS>
Before
Bob
could
reply
,
Mr
Ben
Allen
seized
Mr
Pickwick
by
the
hand
,
and
murmured
,
in
sorrowful
accents
,
"
My
sister
,
my
dear
Sir
;
my
sister
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
is
that
all
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
easily
arrange
that
matter
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Your
sister
is
safe
and
well
,
and
I
am
here
,
my
dear
Sir
,
to

"
Sorry
to
do
anythin

as
may
cause
an
interruption
to
such
wery
pleasant
proceedin

,
as
the
king
said
wen
he
dissolved
the
parliament
,
"
interposed
Mr
Weller
,
who
had
been
peeping
through
the
glass
door
;
"
but
there
's
another
experiment
here
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Here
's
a
wenerable
old
lady
a

lyin

on
the
carpet
waitin

for
dissection
,
or
galwinism
,
or
some
other
rewivin

and
scientific
inwention
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
forgot
,
"
exclaimed
Mr
Ben
Allen
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
aunt
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
lady
!
 
<EOS>
Gently
Sam
,
gently
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Strange
sitivation
for
one
o
'
the
family
,
"
observed
Sam
Weller
,
hoisting
the
aunt
into
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
depitty
sawbones
,
bring
out
the
wollatilly
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
latter
observation
was
addressed
to
the
boy
in
gray
,
who
,
having
handed
over
the
fly
to
the
care
of
the
street
-
keeper
,
had
come
back
to
see
what
all
the
noise
was
about
.
 
<EOS>
Between
the
boy
in
gray
,
and
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
and
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
(
who
having
frightened
his
aunt
into
a
fainting
fit
,
was
affectionately
solicitous
for
her
recovery
)
<EOS>
the
old
lady
was
at
length
restored
to
consciousness
;
then
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
turning
with
a
puzzled
countenance
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
asked
him
what
he
was
about
to
say
,
when
he
had
been
so
alarmingly
interrupted
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
all
friends
here
,
I
presume
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
clearing
his
voice
,
and
looking
towards
the
man
of
few
words
with
the
surly
countenance
,
who
drove
the
fly
with
the
chubby
horse
.
   
<EOS>
This
reminded
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
that
the
boy
in
gray
was
looking
on
,
with
eyes
wide
open
,
and
greedy
ears
.
 
<EOS>
The
incipient
chemist
having
been
lifted
up
by
his
coat
collar
,
and
dropped
outside
the
door
,
Bob
Sawyer
assured
Mr
Pickwick
that
he
might
speak
without
reserve
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
sister
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
turning
to
Benjamin
Allen
,
"
is
in
London
;
<EOS>
well
and
happy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Her
happiness
is
no
object
to
me
,
sir
,
"
said
Benjamin
Allen
,
with
a
flourish
of
the
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Her
husband
IS
an
object
to
ME
,
Sir
,
"
said
Bob
Sawyer
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
shall
be
an
object
to
me
,
sir
,
at
twelve
paces
,
and
a
pretty
object
I
'll
make
of
him
,
sir
---
a
mean
-
spirited
scoundrel
!
"
 
<EOS>
This
,
as
it
stood
,
was
a
very
pretty
denunciation
,
and
magnanimous
withal
;
but
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
rather
weakened
its
effect
,
by
winding
up
with
some
general
observations
concerning
the
punching
of
heads
and
knocking
out
of
eyes
,
which
were
commonplace
by
comparison
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
before
you
apply
those
epithets
to
the
gentleman
in
question
,
consider
,
dispassionately
,
the
extent
of
his
fault
,
and
above
all
remember
that
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
name

cried
Ben
Allen
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
name

<EOS>
"
Mr
Nathaniel
Winkle
,
"
said
Mr
,
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
deliberately
crushed
his
spectacles
beneath
the
heel
of
his
boot
,
and
having
picked
up
the
pieces
,
and
put
them
into
three
separate
pockets
,
folded
his
arms
,
bit
his
lips
,
and
looked
in
a
threatening
manner
at
the
bland
features
of
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
it
's
you
,
is
it
,
Sir
,
who
have
encouraged
and
brought
about
this
match
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
at
length
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
it
's
this
gentleman
's
servant
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
"
interrupted
the
old
lady
,
"
who
has
been
skulking
about
my
house
,
and
endeavouring
to
entrap
my
servants
to
conspire
against
their
mistress
.
<EOS>
---
Martin
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
said
the
surly
man
,
coming
forward
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
the
young
man
you
saw
in
the
lane
,
whom
you
told
me
about
,
this
morning
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Martin
,
who
,
as
it
has
already
appeared
,
was
a
man
of
few
words
,
looked
at
Sam
Weller
,
nodded
his
head
,
and
growled
forth
,
"
That
's
the
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
,
who
was
never
proud
,
gave
a
smile
of
friendly
recognition
as
his
eyes
encountered
those
of
the
surly
groom
,
and
admitted
in
courteous
terms
,
that
he
had
"
knowed
him
afore
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
this
is
the
faithful
creature
,
"
exclaimed
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
"
whom
I
had
nearly
suffocated
!
---
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
how
dare
you
allow
your
fellow
to
be
employed
in
the
abduction
of
my
sister
?
<EOS>
I
demand
that
you
explain
this
matter
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Explain
it
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bob
Sawyer
fiercely
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
conspiracy
,
"
said
Ben
Allen
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
regular
plant
,
"
added
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
disgraceful
imposition
,
"
observed
the
old
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
but
a
do
,
"
remarked
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
hear
me
,
"
urged
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
Mr
Ben
Allen
fell
into
a
chair
that
patients
were
bled
in
,
and
gave
way
to
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
rendered
no
assistance
in
this
matter
,
beyond
being
present
at
one
interview
between
the
young
people
which
I
could
not
prevent
,
and
from
which
I
conceived
my
presence
would
remove
any
slight
colouring
of
impropriety
that
it
might
otherwise
have
had
;
this
is
the
whole
share
I
have
had
in
the
transaction
,
and
I
had
no
suspicion
that
an
immediate
marriage
was
even
contemplated
.
 
<EOS>
Though
,
mind
,
"
added
Mr
Pickwick
,
hastily
checking
himself
---
"

,
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
I
should
have
prevented
it
,
if
I
had
known
that
it
was
intended
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
hear
that
,
all
of
you
;
you
hear
that
?
"
said
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
they
do
,
"
mildly
observed
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
round
,
"
and
,
"
added
that
gentleman
,
his
colour
mounting
as
he
spoke
,
"
I
hope
they
hear
this
,
Sir
,
also
.
 
<EOS>
That
from
what
has
been
stated
to
me
,
sir
,
I
assert
that
you
were
by
no
means
justified
in
attempting
to
force
your
sister
's
inclinations
as
you
did
,
and
that
you
should
rather
have
endeavoured
by
your
kindness
and
forbearance
to
have
supplied
the
place
of
other
nearer
relations
whom
she
had
never
known
,
from
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
As
regards
my
young
friend
,
I
must
beg
to
add
,
that
in
every
point
of
worldly
advantage
he
is
,
at
least
,
on
an
equal
footing
with
yourself
,
if
not
on
a
much
better
one
,
and
that
unless
I
hear
this
question
discussed
with
becoming
temper
and
moderation
,
I
decline
hearing
any
more
said
upon
the
subject
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
make
a
wery
few
remarks
in
addition
to
wot
has
been
put
for'ard
by
the
honourable
gen'l'm'n
as
has
jist
give
over

"
said
Mr
Weller
,
stepping
forth
,
"
<EOS>
wich
is
this
here
:
a
indiwidual
in
company
has
called
me
a
feller
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
matter
,
Sam
,
"
interposed
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
hold
your
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
a
-
goin
'
to
say
nothin'
on
that
'
ere
pint
,
sir
,
"
replied
Sam
,
"
but
merely
this
here
.
 
<EOS>
P'raps
that
gen'l'm'n
may
think
as
there
wos
a
priory
"
tachment
;
but
there
worn't
<EOS>
nothin'
o
'
the
sort
,
for
the
young
lady
said
in
the
wery
beginnin
'
<EOS>
o
'
the
keepin
'
company
,
that
she
could
n't
abide
him
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
's
cut
him
out
,
and
it
'
ud
ha
'
been
jist
the
wery
same
for
him
if
the
young
lady
had
never
seen
Mr
Vinkle
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
wished
to
say
,
sir
,
and
I
hope
I
've
now
made
that
'
ere
gen'l'm'n
's
mind
easy
.
   
<EOS>
A
short
pause
followed
these
consolatory
remarks
of
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Mr
Ben
Allen
rising
from
his
chair
,
protested
that
he
would
never
see
Arabella
's
face
again
;
while
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
despite
Sam
's
flattering
assurance
,
vowed
dreadful
vengeance
on
the
happy
bridegroom
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
just
when
matters
were
at
their
height
,
and
threatening
to
remain
so
,
Mr
Pickwick
found
a
powerful
assistant
in
the
old
lady
,
who
,
evidently
much
struck
by
the
mode
in
which
he
had
advocated
her
niece
's
cause
,
ventured
to
approach
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
with
a
few
comforting
reflections
,
of
which
the
chief
were
,
that
after
all
,
perhaps
,
it
was
well
<EOS>
it
was
no
worse
;
the
least
said
the
soonest
mended
,
and
upon
her
word
she
did
not
know
that
it
was
so
very
bad
after
all
;
what
was
over
could
n't
be
begun
,
and
what
could
n't
be
cured
must
be
endured
;
with
various
other
assurances
of
the
like
novel
and
strengthening
description
.
 
<EOS>
To
all
of
these
,
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
replied
that
he
meant
no
disrespect
to
his
aunt
,
or
anybody
there
,
but
if
it
were
all
the
same
to
them
,
and
they
would
allow
him
to
have
his
own
way
,
he
would
rather
have
the
pleasure
of
hating
his
sister
till
death
,
and
after
it
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
when
this
determination
had
been
announced
half
a
hundred
times
,
the
old
lady
suddenly
bridling
up
and
looking
very
majestic
,
wished
to
know
what
she
had
done
that
no
respect
was
to
be
paid
to
her
years
or
station
,
and
that
she
should
be
obliged
to
beg
and
pray
,
in
that
way
,
of
her
own
nephew
,
whom
she
remembered
about
five
-
and
-
twenty
years
before
he
was
born
,
and
whom
she
had
known
,
personally
,
when
he
had
n't
a
tooth
in
his
head
;
to
say
nothing
of
her
presence
on
the
first
occasion
of
his
having
his
hair
cut
,
and
assistance
at
numerous
other
times
and
ceremonies
during
his
babyhood
,
of
sufficient
importance
to
found
a
claim
upon
his
affection
,
obedience
,
and
sympathies
,
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
While
the
good
lady
was
bestowing
this
objurgation
on
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
Bob
Sawyer
and
Mr
Pickwick
had
retired
in
close
conversation
to
the
inner
room
,
where
Mr
Sawyer
was
observed
to
apply
himself
several
times
to
the
mouth
of
a
black
bottle
,
under
the
influence
of
which
,
his
features
gradually
assumed
a
cheerful
and
even
jovial
expression
.
 
<EOS>
And
at
last
he
emerged
from
the
room
,
bottle
in
hand
,
and
,
remarking
that
he
was
very
sorry
to
say
he
had
been
making
a
fool
of
himself
,
begged
to
propose
the
health
and
happiness
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Winkle
,
whose
felicity
,
so
far
from
envying
,
he
would
be
the
first
to
congratulate
them
upon
.
 
<EOS>
Hearing
this
,
Mr
Ben
Allen
suddenly
arose
from
his
chair
,
and
,
seizing
the
black
bottle
,
drank
the
toast
so
heartily
,
<EOS>
that
,
the
liquor
being
strong
,
he
became
nearly
as
black
in
the
face
as
the
bottle
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
the
black
bottle
went
round
till
it
was
empty
,
and
there
was
so
much
shaking
of
hands
and
interchanging
of
compliments
,
that
even
the
metal
-
visaged
Mr
Martin
condescended
to
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
said
Bob
Sawyer
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
"
we
'll
have
a
jolly
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
that
I
must
return
to
my
inn
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
accustomed
to
fatigue
lately
,
and
my
journey
has
tired
me
exceedingly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
take
some
tea
,
Mr
Pickwick
?
"
said
the
old
lady
,
with
irresistible
sweetness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
I
would
rather
not
,
"
replied
that
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
that
the
old
lady
's
evidently
increasing
admiration
was
Mr
Pickwick
's
principal
inducement
for
going
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
of
Mrs
Bardell
;
and
every
glance
of
the
old
lady
's
eyes
threw
him
into
a
cold
perspiration
.
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Pickwick
could
by
no
means
be
prevailed
upon
to
stay
,
it
was
arranged
at
once
,
on
his
own
proposition
,
that
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
should
accompany
him
on
his
journey
to
the
elder
Mr
Winkle
's
,
and
that
the
coach
should
be
at
the
door
,
at
nine
o'clock
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
took
his
leave
,
and
,
followed
by
Samuel
Weller
,
repaired
to
the
Bush
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
worthy
of
remark
,
that
Mr
Martin
's
face
was
horribly
convulsed
as
he
shook
hands
with
Sam
at
parting
,
and
that
he
gave
vent
to
a
smile
and
an
oath
simultaneously
;
from
which
tokens
it
has
been
inferred
by
those
who
were
best
acquainted
with
that
gentleman
's
peculiarities
,
that
he
expressed
himself
much
pleased
with
Mr
Weller
's
society
,
and
requested
the
honour
of
his
further
acquaintance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
order
a
private
room
,
Sir
?
"
inquired
Sam
,
when
they
reached
the
Bush
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
no
,
Sam
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
as
I
dined
in
the
coffee
-
room
,
and
shall
go
to
bed
soon
,
it
is
hardly
worth
while
.
<EOS>
See
who
there
is
in
the
travellers

room
,
Sam

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
departed
on
his
errand
,
and
presently
returned
to
say
that
there
was
only
a
gentleman
with
one
eye
;
and
that
he
and
the
landlord
were
drinking
a
bowl
of
bishop
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
join
them
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
queer
customer
,
the
vun
-
eyed
vun
,
sir
,
"
observed
Mr
Weller
,
as
he
led
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
-
gammonin
'
that
'
ere
landlord
,
he
is
,
sir
,
till
he
do
n't
rightly
know
wether
he
's
a

standing
on
the
soles
of
his
boots
or
the
crown
of
his
hat
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
individual
to
whom
this
observation
referred
,
was
sitting
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
when
Mr
Pickwick
entered
,
and
was
smoking
a
large
Dutch
pipe
,
with
his
eye
intently
fixed
on
the
round
face
of
the
landlord
;
a
jolly
-
looking
old
personage
,
to
whom
he
had
recently
been
relating
some
tale
of
wonder
,
as
was
testified
by
sundry
disjointed
exclamations
of
,
"
Well
,
I
would
n't
have
believed
it
!
 
<EOS>
The
strangest
thing
I
ever
heard
!
 
<EOS>
Could
n't
have
supposed
it
possible
!
"
<EOS>
and
other
expressions
of
astonishment
which
burst
spontaneously
from
his
lips
,
as
he
returned
the
fixed
gaze
of
the
one
-
eyed
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Servant
,
sir
,
"
said
the
one
-
eyed
man
to
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fine
night
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
much
so
indeed
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
the
waiter
placed
a
small
decanter
of
brandy
,
and
some
hot
water
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
While
Mr
Pickwick
was
mixing
his
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
the
one
-
eyed
man
looked
round
at
him
earnestly
,
from
time
to
time
,
and
at
length
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
've
seen
you
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
recollect
you
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
not
,
"
said
the
one
-
eyed
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
know
me
,
but
I
knew
two
friends
of
yours
that
were
stopping
at
the
Peacock
at
Eatanswill
,
at
the
time
of
the
election
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
rejoined
the
one
-
eyed
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
mentioned
a
little
circumstance
to
them
about
a
friend
of
mine
of
the
name
of
Tom
Smart
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
've
heard
them
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Often
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Pickwick
,
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
your
uncle
,
I
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
only
a
friend
of
my
uncle
's
,
"
replied
the
one
-
eyed
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
a
wonderful
man
,
that
uncle
of
yours
,
though
,
"
remarked
the
landlord
shaking
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
think
he
was
;
I
think
I
may
say
he
was
,
"
answered
the
one
-
eyed
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
tell
you
a
story
about
that
same
uncle
,
gentlemen
,
that
would
rather
surprise
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Could
you
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
us
hear
it
,
by
all
means
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
one
-
eyed
bagman
ladled
out
a
glass
of
negus
from
the
bowl
,
and
drank
it
;
smoked
a
long
whiff
out
of
the
Dutch
pipe
;
and
then
,
calling
to
Sam
Weller
who
was
lingering
near
the
door
,
that
he
need
n't
go
away
unless
he
wanted
to
,
because
the
story
was
no
secret
,
fixed
his
eye
upon
the
landlord
's
,
and
proceeded
,
in
the
words
of
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
49
.
<EOS>
Containing
the
story
of
the
bagman
's
uncle
 
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
the
bagman
,
"
was
one
of
the
merriest
,
pleasantest
,
cleverest
fellows
,
that
ever
lived
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
had
known
him
,
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
On
second
thoughts
,
gentlemen
,
I
do
n't
wish
you
had
known
him
,
for
if
you
had
,
you
would
have
been
all
,
by
this
time
,
in
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
,
if
not
dead
,
at
all
events
so
near
it
,
as
to
have
taken
to
stopping
at
home
and
giving
up
company
,
which
would
have
deprived
me
of
the
inestimable
pleasure
of
addressing
you
at
this
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
I
wish
your
fathers
and
mothers
had
known
my
uncle
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
been
amazingly
fond
of
him
,
especially
your
respectable
mothers
;
I
know
they
would
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
two
of
his
numerous
virtues
predominated
over
the
many
that
adorned
his
character
,
I
should
say
they
were
his
mixed
punch
and
his
after
-
supper
song
.
 
<EOS>
Excuse
my
dwelling
on
these
melancholy
recollections
of
departed
worth
<EOS>
;
you
wo
n't
see
a
man
like
my
uncle
every
day
in
the
week
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
considered
it
a
great
point
in
my
uncle
's
character
,
gentlemen
,
that
he
was
the
intimate
friend
and
companion
of
Tom
Smart
,
of
the
great
house
of
Bilson
and
Slum
,
Cateaton
Street
,
City
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
collected
for
Tiggin
and
Welps
,
but
for
a
long
time
he
went
pretty
near
the
same
journey
as
Tom
;
and
the
very
first
night
they
met
,
my
uncle
took
a
fancy
for
Tom
,
and
Tom
took
a
fancy
for
my
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
They
made
a
bet
of
a
new
hat
before
they
had
known
each
other
half
an
hour
,
who
should
brew
the
best
quart
of
punch
and
drink
it
the
quickest
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
was
judged
to
have
won
the
making
,
but
Tom
Smart
beat
him
in
the
drinking
by
about
half
a
salt
-
spoonful
.
 
<EOS>
They
took
another
quart
apiece
to
drink
each
other
's
health
in
,
and
were
staunch
friends
ever
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
destiny
in
these
things
,
gentlemen
;
we
ca
n't
help
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
personal
appearance
,
my
uncle
was
a
trifle
shorter
than
the
middle
size
;
he
was
a
thought
stouter
too
,
than
the
ordinary
run
of
people
,
and
perhaps
his
face
might
be
a
shade
redder
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
the
jolliest
face
you
ever
saw
,
gentleman
:
something
like
Punch
,
with
a
handsome
nose
and
chin
;
his
eyes
were
always
twinkling
and
sparkling
with
good
-
humour
;
and
a
smile
---
not
one
of
your
unmeaning
wooden
grins
,
but
a
real
,
merry
,
hearty
,
good
-
tempered
smile
---
was
perpetually
on
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
pitched
out
of
his
gig
once
,
and
knocked
,
head
first
,
against
a
milestone
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
lay
,
stunned
,
and
so
cut
about
the
face
with
some
gravel
which
had
been
heaped
up
alongside
it
,
that
,
to
use
my
uncle
's
own
strong
expression
,
if
his
mother
could
have
revisited
the
earth
,
she
would
n't
have
known
him
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
when
I
come
to
think
of
the
matter
,
gentlemen
,
I
feel
pretty
sure
she
would
n't
.
 
<EOS>
for
she
died
when
my
uncle
was
two
years
and
seven
months
old
,
and
I
think
it
's
very
likely
that
,
even
without
the
gravel
,
his
top
-
boots
would
have
puzzled
the
good
lady
not
a
little
;
to
say
nothing
of
his
jolly
red
face
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
there
he
lay
,
and
I
have
heard
my
uncle
say
,
many
a
time
,
that
the
man
said
who
picked
him
up
that
he
was
smiling
as
merrily
as
if
he
had
tumbled
out
for
a
treat
,
and
that
after
they
had
bled
him
,
the
first
faint
glimmerings
of
returning
animation
,
were
his
jumping
up
in
bed
,
bursting
out
into
a
loud
laugh
,
kissing
the
young
woman
who
held
the
basin
,
and
demanding
a
mutton
chop
and
a
pickled
walnut
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
fond
of
pickled
walnuts
,
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
always
found
that
,
taken
without
vinegar
,
they
relished
the
beer
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
's
great
journey
was
in
the
fall
of
the
leaf
,
at
which
time
he
collected
debts
,
and
took
orders
,
in
the
north
;
going
from
London
to
Edinburgh
,
from
Edinburgh
to
Glasgow
,
from
Glasgow
back
to
Edinburgh
,
and
thence
to
London
by
the
smack
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
to
understand
that
his
second
visit
to
Edinburgh
was
for
his
own
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
He
used
to
go
back
for
a
week
,
just
to
look
up
his
old
friends
;
and
what
with
breakfasting
with
this
one
,
lunching
with
that
,
dining
with
the
third
,
and
supping
with
another
,
a
pretty
tight
week
he
used
to
make
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
any
of
you
,
gentlemen
,
ever
partook
of
a
real
substantial
hospitable
Scotch
breakfast
,
and
then
went
out
to
a
slight
lunch
of
a
bushel
of
oysters
,
a
dozen
or
so
of
bottled
ale
,
and
a
noggin
or
two
of
whiskey
to
close
up
with
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
ever
did
,
you
will
agree
with
me
that
it
requires
a
pretty
strong
head
to
go
out
to
dinner
and
supper
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
bless
your
hearts
and
eyebrows
,
all
this
sort
of
thing
was
nothing
to
my
uncle
!
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
well
seasoned
,
that
it
was
mere
child
's
play
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
him
say
that
he
could
see
the
Dundee
people
out
,
any
day
,
and
walk
home
afterwards
without
staggering
;
and
yet
the
Dundee
people
have
as
strong
heads
and
as
strong
punch
,
gentlemen
,
as
you
are
likely
to
meet
with
,
between
the
poles
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
of
a
Glasgow
man
and
a
Dundee
man
drinking
against
each
other
for
fifteen
hours
at
a
sitting
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
both
suffocated
,
as
nearly
as
could
be
ascertained
,
at
the
same
moment
,
but
with
this
trifling
exception
,
gentlemen
,
they
were
not
a
bit
the
worse
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
night
,
within
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
of
the
time
when
he
had
settled
to
take
shipping
for
London
,
my
uncle
supped
at
the
house
of
a
very
old
friend
of
his
,
a
Bailie
Mac
something
and
four
syllables
after
it
,
who
lived
in
the
old
town
of
Edinburgh
.
<EOS>
There
were
the
bailie
's
wife
,
and
the
bailie
's
three
daughters
,
and
the
bailie
's
grown
-
up
son
,
and
three
or
four
stout
,
bushy
eye
-
browed
,
canny
,
old
Scotch
fellows
,
that
the
bailie
had
got
together
to
do
honour
to
my
uncle
,
and
help
to
make
merry
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
glorious
supper
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
kippered
salmon
,
and
Finnan
haddocks
,
and
a
lamb
's
head
,
and
a
haggis
---
a
celebrated
Scotch
dish
,
gentlemen
,
which
my
uncle
used
to
say
always
looked
to
him
,
when
it
came
to
table
,
very
much
like
a
Cupid
's
stomach
---
and
a
great
many
other
things
besides
,
that
I
forget
the
names
of
,
but
very
good
things
,
notwithstanding
.
 
<EOS>
The
lassies
were
pretty
and
agreeable
;
the
bailie
's
wife
was
one
of
the
best
creatures
that
ever
lived
;
and
my
uncle
was
in
thoroughly
good
cue
.
 
<EOS>
The
consequence
of
which
was
,
that
the
young
ladies
tittered
and
giggled
,
and
the
old
lady
laughed
out
loud
,
and
the
bailie
and
the
other
old
fellows
roared
till
they
were
red
in
the
face
,
the
whole
mortal
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
quite
recollect
how
many
tumblers
of
whiskey
-
toddy
each
man
drank
after
supper
;
but
this
I
know
,
that
about
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
the
bailie
's
grown
-
up
son
became
insensible
while
attempting
the
first
verse
of
"
Willie
brewed
a
peck
o
'
maut
"
;
and
he
having
been
,
for
half
an
hour
before
,
the
only
other
man
visible
above
the
mahogany
<EOS>
,
it
occurred
to
my
uncle
that
it
was
almost
time
to
think
about
going
,
especially
as
drinking
had
set
in
at
seven
o'clock
,
in
order
that
he
might
get
home
at
a
decent
hour
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
thinking
it
might
not
be
quite
polite
to
go
just
then
,
my
uncle
voted
himself
into
the
chair
,
mixed
another
glass
,
<EOS>
rose
to
propose
his
own
health
,
addressed
himself
in
a
neat
and
complimentary
speech
,
and
drank
the
toast
with
great
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
Still
nobody
woke
;
so
my
uncle
took
a
little
drop
more
---
<EOS>
neat
this
time
,
to
prevent
the
toddy
from
disagreeing
with
him
---
and
,
laying
violent
hands
on
his
hat
,
sallied
forth
into
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
"
it
was
a
wild
,
gusty
night
when
my
uncle
closed
the
bailie
's
door
,
and
settling
his
hat
firmly
on
his
head
to
prevent
the
wind
from
taking
it
,
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
and
looking
upward
,
took
a
short
survey
of
the
state
of
the
weather
.
 
<EOS>
The
clouds
were
drifting
over
the
moon
at
their
giddiest
speed
;
at
one
time
wholly
obscuring
her
;
at
another
,
suffering
her
to
burst
forth
in
full
splendour
and
shed
her
light
on
all
the
objects
around
;
anon
,
driving
over
her
again
,
with
increased
velocity
,
and
shrouding
everything
in
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
"
Really
,
this
wo
n't
do
,
"
said
my
uncle
,
addressing
himself
to
the
weather
,
as
if
he
felt
himself
personally
offended
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
at
all
the
kind
of
thing
for
my
voyage
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
not
do
at
any
price
,
"
said
my
uncle
,
very
impressively
.
 
<EOS>
Having
repeated
this
,
several
times
,
he
recovered
his
balance
with
some
difficulty
---
for
he
was
rather
giddy
with
looking
up
into
the
sky
so
long
---
and
walked
merrily
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
bailie
's
house
was
in
the
Canongate
,
and
my
uncle
was
going
to
the
other
end
of
Leith
Walk
,
rather
better
than
a
mile
's
journey
.
 
<EOS>
On
either
side
of
him
,
there
shot
up
against
the
dark
sky
,
tall
,
gaunt
,
straggling
houses
,
with
time
-
stained
fronts
,
and
windows
that
seemed
to
have
shared
the
lot
of
eyes
in
mortals
,
and
to
have
grown
dim
and
sunken
with
age
.
 
<EOS>
Six
,
seven
,
eight
Storey
high
,
were
the
houses
;
storey
piled
upon
storey
,
as
children
build
with
cards
---
throwing
their
dark
shadows
over
the
roughly
paved
road
,
and
making
the
dark
night
darker
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
oil
lamps
were
scattered
at
long
distances
,
but
they
only
served
to
mark
the
dirty
entrance
to
some
narrow
close
,
or
to
show
where
a
common
stair
communicated
,
by
steep
and
intricate
windings
,
with
the
various
flats
above
.
 
<EOS>
Glancing
at
all
these
things
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
seen
them
too
often
before
,
to
think
them
worthy
of
much
notice
now
,
my
uncle
walked
up
the
middle
of
the
street
,
with
a
thumb
in
each
waistcoat
pocket
,
indulging
from
time
to
time
in
various
snatches
of
song
,
chanted
forth
with
such
good
-
will
and
spirit
,
that
the
quiet
honest
folk
started
from
their
first
sleep
and
lay
trembling
in
bed
till
the
sound
died
away
in
the
distance
;
when
,
satisfying
themselves
that
it
was
only
some
drunken
ne'er
-
do
-
weel
finding
his
way
home
,
they
covered
themselves
up
warm
and
fell
asleep
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
particular
in
describing
how
my
uncle
walked
up
the
middle
of
the
street
,
with
his
thumbs
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
,
gentlemen
,
because
,
as
he
often
used
to
say
(
and
with
great
reason
too
)
there
is
nothing
at
all
extraordinary
in
this
story
,
unless
you
distinctly
understand
at
the
beginning
,
that
he
was
not
by
any
means
of
a
marvellous
or
romantic
turn
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
my
uncle
walked
on
with
his
thumbs
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
,
taking
the
middle
of
the
street
to
himself
,
and
singing
,
now
a
verse
of
a
love
song
,
and
then
a
verse
of
a
drinking
one
,
and
when
he
was
tired
of
both
,
whistling
melodiously
,
until
he
reached
the
North
Bridge
,
which
,
at
this
point
,
connects
the
old
and
new
towns
of
Edinburgh
.
 
<EOS>
Here
he
stopped
for
a
minute
,
to
look
at
the
strange
,
irregular
clusters
of
lights
piled
one
above
the
other
,
and
twinkling
afar
off
so
high
,
that
they
looked
like
stars
,
gleaming
from
the
castle
walls
on
the
one
side
and
the
Calton
Hill
on
the
other
,
as
if
they
illuminated
veritable
castles
in
the
air
;
while
the
old
picturesque
town
slept
heavily
on
,
in
gloom
and
darkness
below
:
its
palace
and
chapel
of
Holyrood
,
guarded
day
and
night
,
as
a
friend
of
my
uncle
's
used
to
say
,
by
old
Arthur
's
Seat
,
towering
,
surly
and
dark
,
like
some
gruff
genius
,
over
the
ancient
city
he
has
watched
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
gentlemen
,
my
uncle
stopped
here
,
for
a
minute
,
to
look
about
him
;
and
then
,
paying
a
compliment
to
the
weather
,
which
had
a
little
cleared
up
,
though
the
moon
was
sinking
,
walked
on
again
,
as
royally
as
before
;
keeping
the
middle
of
the
road
with
great
dignity
,
and
looking
as
if
he
would
very
much
like
to
meet
with
somebody
who
would
dispute
possession
of
it
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nobody
at
all
disposed
to
contest
the
point
,
as
it
happened
;
and
so
,
on
he
went
,
with
his
thumbs
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
,
like
a
lamb
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
my
uncle
reached
the
end
of
Leith
Walk
,
he
had
to
cross
a
pretty
large
piece
of
waste
ground
which
separated
him
from
a
short
street
which
he
had
to
turn
down
to
go
direct
to
his
lodging
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
in
this
piece
of
waste
ground
,
there
was
,
at
that
time
,
an
enclosure
belonging
to
some
wheelwright
who
contracted
with
the
Post
Office
for
the
purchase
of
old
,
worn
-
out
mail
coaches
;
and
my
uncle
,
being
very
fond
of
coaches
,
old
,
young
,
or
middle
-
aged
,
all
at
once
took
it
into
his
head
to
step
out
of
his
road
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
peep
between
the
palings
at
these
mails
---
about
a
dozen
of
which
he
remembered
to
have
seen
,
crowded
together
in
a
very
forlorn
and
dismantled
state
,
inside
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
was
a
very
enthusiastic
,
emphatic
sort
of
person
,
gentlemen
;
so
,
finding
that
he
could
not
obtain
a
good
peep
between
the
palings
he
got
over
them
,
and
sitting
himself
quietly
down
on
an
old
axle
-
tree
,
began
to
contemplate
the
mail
coaches
with
a
deal
of
gravity
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
might
be
a
dozen
of
them
,
or
there
might
be
more
---
my
uncle
was
never
quite
certain
on
this
point
,
and
being
a
man
of
very
scrupulous
veracity
about
numbers
,
did
n't
like
to
say
---
but
there
they
stood
,
all
huddled
together
in
the
most
desolate
condition
imaginable
.
 
<EOS>
The
doors
had
been
torn
from
their
hinges
and
removed
;
the
linings
had
been
stripped
off
,
only
a
shred
hanging
here
and
there
by
a
rusty
nail
;
the
lamps
were
gone
,
the
poles
had
long
since
vanished
,
the
ironwork
was
rusty
,
the
paint
was
worn
away
;
the
wind
whistled
through
the
chinks
in
the
bare
woodwork
;
and
the
rain
,
which
had
collected
on
the
roofs
,
fell
,
drop
by
drop
,
into
the
insides
with
a
hollow
and
melancholy
sound
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
the
decaying
skeletons
of
departed
mails
,
and
in
that
lonely
place
,
at
that
time
of
night
,
they
looked
chill
and
dismal
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
rested
his
head
upon
his
hands
,
and
thought
of
the
busy
,
bustling
people
who
had
rattled
about
,
years
before
,
in
the
old
coaches
,
and
were
now
as
silent
and
changed
;
he
thought
of
the
numbers
of
people
to
whom
one
of
these
crazy
,
mouldering
vehicles
had
borne
,
night
after
night
,
for
many
years
,
and
through
all
weathers
,
the
anxiously
expected
intelligence
,
the
eagerly
looked
-
for
remittance
,
the
promised
assurance
of
health
and
safety
,
the
sudden
announcement
of
sickness
and
death
.
 
<EOS>
The
merchant
,
the
lover
,
the
wife
,
the
widow
,
the
mother
,
the
school
-
boy
,
the
very
child
who
tottered
to
the
door
at
the
postman
's
knock
---
how
had
they
all
looked
forward
to
the
arrival
of
the
old
coach
.
 
<EOS>
And
where
were
they
all
now
?
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
my
uncle
used
to
SAY
that
he
thought
all
this
at
the
time
,
but
I
rather
suspect
he
learned
it
out
of
some
book
afterwards
,
<EOS>
for
he
distinctly
stated
that
he
fell
into
a
kind
of
doze
,
as
he
sat
on
the
old
axle
-
tree
looking
at
the
decayed
mail
coaches
,
and
that
he
was
suddenly
awakened
by
some
deep
church
bell
striking
two
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
my
uncle
was
never
a
fast
thinker
,
and
if
he
had
thought
all
these
things
,
I
am
quite
certain
it
would
have
taken
him
till
full
half
-
past
two
o'clock
at
the
very
least
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
,
therefore
,
decidedly
of
opinion
,
gentlemen
,
that
my
uncle
fell
into
a
kind
of
doze
,
without
having
thought
about
anything
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
Be
this
as
it
may
,
a
church
bell
struck
two
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
woke
,
rubbed
his
eyes
,
and
jumped
up
in
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
one
instant
,
after
the
clock
struck
two
,
the
whole
of
this
deserted
and
quiet
spot
had
become
a
scene
of
most
extraordinary
life
and
animation
.
 
<EOS>
The
mail
coach
doors
were
on
their
hinges
,
the
lining
was
replaced
,
the
ironwork
was
as
good
as
new
,
the
paint
was
restored
,
the
lamps
were
alight
;
cushions
and
greatcoats
were
on
every
coach
-
box
,
porters
were
thrusting
parcels
into
every
boot
,
guards
were
stowing
away
letter
-
bags
,
hostlers
were
dashing
pails
of
water
against
the
renovated
wheels
;
numbers
of
men
were
pushing
about
,
fixing
poles
into
every
coach
<EOS>
;
passengers
arrived
,
portmanteaus
were
handed
up
,
horses
were
put
to
;
in
short
,
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
every
mail
there
,
was
to
be
off
directly
.
 
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
my
uncle
opened
his
eyes
so
wide
at
all
this
,
that
,
to
the
very
last
moment
of
his
life
,
he
used
to
wonder
how
it
fell
out
that
he
had
ever
been
able
to
shut
'em
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Now
then
!
"
said
a
voice
,
as
my
uncle
felt
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
,
"
you
're
booked
for
one
inside
.
 
<EOS>
You
'd
better
get
in
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
booked
!
"
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
,
turning
round
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Yes
,
certainly
.
"
   
"
My
uncle
,
gentlemen
,
could
say
nothing
,
he
was
so
very
much
astonished
.
 
<EOS>
The
queerest
thing
of
all
was
that
although
there
was
such
a
crowd
of
persons
,
and
although
fresh
faces
were
pouring
in
,
every
moment
,
there
was
no
telling
where
they
came
from
.
<EOS>
They
seemed
to
start
up
,
in
some
strange
manner
,
from
the
ground
,
or
the
air
,
and
disappear
in
the
same
way
.
 
<EOS>
When
a
porter
had
put
his
luggage
in
the
coach
,
and
received
his
fare
,
he
turned
round
and
was
gone
;
and
before
my
uncle
had
well
begun
to
wonder
what
had
become
of
him
,
half
a
dozen
fresh
ones
started
up
,
and
staggered
along
under
the
weight
of
parcels
,
which
seemed
big
enough
to
crush
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
passengers
were
all
dressed
so
oddly
too
!
 
<EOS>
Large
,
broad
-
skirted
laced
coats
,
with
great
cuffs
and
no
collars
;
and
wigs
,
gentlemen
---
great
formal
wigs
with
a
tie
behind
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
could
make
nothing
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Now
,
are
you
going
to
get
in
?
"
said
the
person
who
had
addressed
my
uncle
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
as
a
mail
guard
,
with
a
wig
on
his
head
and
most
enormous
cuffs
to
his
coat
,
and
had
a
lantern
in
one
hand
,
and
a
huge
blunderbuss
in
the
other
,
which
he
was
going
to
stow
away
in
his
little
arm
-
chest
.
 
<EOS>
"
ARE
you
going
to
get
in
,
Jack
Martin
?
"
said
the
guard
,
holding
the
lantern
to
my
uncle
's
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Hollo
!
"
said
my
uncle
,
falling
back
a
step
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
familiar
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
It
's
so
on
the
way
-
bill
,
"
said
the
guard
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Is
n't
there
a
"
Mister
"
before
it
?
"
said
my
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
For
he
felt
,
gentlemen
,
that
for
a
guard
he
did
n't
know
,
to
call
him
Jack
Martin
,
was
a
liberty
which
the
Post
Office
would
n't
have
sanctioned
if
they
had
known
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
No
,
there
is
not
,
"
rejoined
the
guard
coolly
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Is
the
fare
paid
?
"
inquired
my
uncle
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Of
course
it
is
,
"
rejoined
the
guard
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
it
is
,
is
it
?
"
said
my
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
here
goes
!
 
<EOS>
Which
coach
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
"
This
,
"
said
the
guard
,
pointing
to
an
old
-
fashioned
Edinburgh
and
London
mail
,
which
had
the
steps
down
and
the
door
open
.
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
 
<EOS>
Here
are
the
other
passengers
.
 
<EOS>
Let
them
get
in
first
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
the
guard
spoke
,
there
all
at
once
appeared
,
right
in
front
of
my
uncle
,
a
young
gentleman
in
a
powdered
wig
,
and
a
sky
-
blue
coat
trimmed
with
silver
,
made
very
full
and
broad
in
the
skirts
,
which
were
lined
with
buckram
.
 
<EOS>
Tiggin
and
Welps
were
in
the
printed
calico
and
waistcoat
piece
line
,
gentlemen
,
so
my
uncle
knew
all
the
materials
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
He
wore
knee
breeches
,
and
a
kind
of
leggings
rolled
up
over
his
silk
stockings
,
and
shoes
with
buckles
;
he
had
ruffles
at
his
wrists
,
a
three
-
cornered
hat
on
his
head
,
and
a
long
taper
sword
by
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
The
flaps
of
his
waist
-
coat
came
half
-
way
down
his
thighs
,
and
the
ends
of
his
cravat
reached
to
his
waist
.
 
<EOS>
He
stalked
gravely
to
the
coach
door
,
pulled
off
his
hat
,
and
held
it
above
his
head
at
arm
's
length
,
cocking
his
little
finger
in
the
air
at
the
same
time
,
as
some
affected
people
do
,
when
they
take
a
cup
of
tea
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
drew
his
feet
together
,
and
made
a
low
,
grave
bow
,
and
then
put
out
his
left
hand
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
was
just
going
to
step
forward
,
and
shake
it
heartily
,
when
he
perceived
that
these
attentions
were
directed
,
not
towards
him
,
but
to
a
young
lady
who
just
then
appeared
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
,
attired
in
an
old
-
fashioned
green
velvet
dress
with
a
long
waist
and
stomacher
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
no
bonnet
on
her
head
,
gentlemen
,
which
was
muffled
in
a
black
silk
hood
,
but
she
looked
round
for
an
instant
as
she
prepared
to
get
into
the
coach
,
and
such
a
beautiful
face
as
she
disclosed
,
my
uncle
had
never
seen
---
not
even
in
a
picture
.
 
<EOS>
She
got
into
the
coach
,
holding
up
her
dress
with
one
hand
;
and
as
my
uncle
always
said
with
a
round
oath
,
when
he
told
the
story
,
he
would
n't
have
believed
it
possible
that
legs
and
feet
could
have
been
brought
to
such
a
state
of
perfection
unless
he
had
seen
them
with
his
own
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
,
in
this
one
glimpse
of
the
beautiful
face
,
my
uncle
saw
that
the
young
lady
cast
an
imploring
look
upon
him
,
and
that
she
appeared
terrified
and
distressed
.
 
<EOS>
He
noticed
,
too
,
that
the
young
fellow
in
the
powdered
wig
,
notwithstanding
his
show
of
gallantry
,
which
was
all
very
fine
and
grand
,
clasped
her
tight
by
the
wrist
when
she
got
in
,
and
followed
himself
immediately
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
An
uncommonly
ill
-
looking
fellow
,
in
a
close
brown
wig
,
and
a
plum
-
coloured
suit
,
wearing
a
very
large
sword
,
and
boots
up
to
his
hips
,
belonged
to
the
party
;
and
when
he
sat
himself
down
next
to
the
young
lady
,
who
shrank
into
a
corner
at
his
approach
,
my
uncle
was
confirmed
in
his
original
impression
that
something
dark
and
mysterious
was
going
forward
,
or
,
as
he
always
said
himself
,
that
"
there
was
a
screw
loose
somewhere
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
's
quite
surprising
how
quickly
he
made
up
his
mind
to
help
the
lady
at
any
peril
,
if
she
needed
any
help
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Death
and
lightning
!
"
exclaimed
the
young
gentleman
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
sword
as
my
uncle
entered
the
coach
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Blood
and
thunder
!
"
roared
the
other
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
whipped
his
sword
out
,
and
made
a
lunge
at
my
uncle
without
further
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
had
no
weapon
about
him
,
but
with
great
dexterity
he
snatched
the
ill
-
looking
gentleman
's
three
-
cornered
hat
from
his
head
,
and
,
receiving
the
point
of
his
sword
right
through
the
crown
,
squeezed
the
sides
together
,
and
held
it
tight
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Pink
him
behind
!
"
cried
the
ill
-
looking
gentleman
to
his
companion
,
as
he
struggled
to
regain
his
sword
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
He
had
better
not
,
"
cried
my
uncle
,
displaying
the
heel
of
one
of
his
shoes
,
in
a
threatening
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
kick
his
brains
out
,
if
he
has
any
---
,
or
fracture
his
skull
if
he
has
n't
.
"
 
<EOS>
Exerting
all
his
strength
,
at
this
moment
,
my
uncle
wrenched
the
ill
-
looking
man
's
sword
from
his
grasp
,
and
flung
it
clean
out
of
the
coach
window
,
upon
which
the
younger
gentleman
vociferated
,
"
Death
and
lightning
!
"
<EOS>
again
,
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
hilt
of
his
sword
,
in
a
very
fierce
manner
,
but
did
n't
draw
it
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
gentlemen
,
as
my
uncle
used
to
say
with
a
smile
,
perhaps
he
was
afraid
of
alarming
the
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Now
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
my
uncle
,
taking
his
seat
deliberately
,
"
I
do
n't
want
to
have
any
death
,
with
or
without
lightning
,
in
a
lady
's
presence
,
and
we
have
had
quite
blood
and
thundering
enough
for
one
journey
;
so
,
if
you
please
,
we
'll
sit
in
our
places
like
quiet
insides
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
guard
,
pick
up
that
gentleman
's
carving
-
knife
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
quickly
as
my
uncle
said
the
words
,
the
guard
appeared
at
the
coach
window
,
with
the
gentleman
's
sword
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
up
his
lantern
,
and
looked
earnestly
in
my
uncle
's
face
,
as
he
handed
it
in
,
when
,
by
its
light
,
my
uncle
saw
,
to
his
great
surprise
,
that
an
immense
crowd
of
mail
-
coach
guards
swarmed
round
the
window
,
every
one
of
whom
had
his
eyes
earnestly
fixed
upon
him
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
never
seen
such
a
sea
of
white
faces
,
red
bodies
,
and
earnest
eyes
,
in
all
his
born
days
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
This
is
the
strangest
sort
of
thing
I
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
,
"
thought
my
uncle
;
"
allow
me
to
return
you
your
hat
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
ill
-
looking
gentleman
received
his
three
-
cornered
hat
in
silence
,
looked
at
the
hole
in
the
middle
with
an
inquiring
air
,
and
finally
stuck
it
on
the
top
of
his
wig
with
a
solemnity
the
effect
of
which
was
a
trifle
impaired
by
his
sneezing
violently
at
the
moment
,
and
jerking
it
off
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
All
right
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
guard
with
the
lantern
,
mounting
into
his
little
seat
behind
.
 
<EOS>
Away
they
went
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
peeped
out
of
the
coach
window
as
they
emerged
from
the
yard
,
and
observed
that
the
other
mails
,
with
coachmen
,
guards
,
horses
,
and
passengers
,
complete
,
were
driving
round
and
round
in
circles
,
at
a
slow
trot
of
about
five
miles
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
burned
with
indignation
,
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
commercial
man
,
he
felt
that
the
mail
-
bags
were
not
to
be
trifled
with
,
and
he
resolved
to
memorialise
the
Post
Office
on
the
subject
,
the
very
instant
he
reached
London
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
present
,
however
,
his
thoughts
were
occupied
with
the
young
lady
who
sat
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
coach
,
with
her
face
muffled
closely
in
her
hood
;
the
gentleman
with
the
sky
-
blue
coat
sitting
opposite
to
her
;
the
other
man
in
the
plum
-
coloured
suit
,
by
her
side
;
and
both
watching
her
intently
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
so
much
as
rustled
the
folds
of
her
hood
,
he
could
hear
the
ill
-
looking
man
clap
his
hand
upon
his
sword
,
and
could
tell
by
the
other
's
breathing
(
it
was
so
dark
he
could
n't
see
his
face
)
that
he
was
looking
as
big
as
if
he
were
going
to
devour
her
at
a
mouthful
.
<EOS>
This
roused
my
uncle
more
and
more
,
and
he
resolved
,
come
what
might
,
to
see
the
end
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
great
admiration
for
bright
eyes
,
and
sweet
faces
,
and
pretty
legs
and
feet
;
in
short
,
he
was
fond
of
the
whole
sex
.
 
<EOS>
It
runs
in
our
family
,
gentleman
---
so
am
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Many
were
the
devices
which
my
uncle
practised
,
to
attract
the
lady
's
attention
,
or
at
all
events
,
to
engage
the
mysterious
gentlemen
in
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
all
in
vain
;
the
gentlemen
would
n't
talk
,
and
the
lady
did
n't
dare
.
 
<EOS>
He
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
coach
window
at
intervals
,
and
bawled
out
to
know
why
they
did
n't
go
faster
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
called
till
he
was
hoarse
;
nobody
paid
the
least
attention
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
leaned
back
in
the
coach
,
and
thought
of
the
beautiful
face
,
and
the
feet
and
legs
.
 
<EOS>
This
answered
better
;
it
whiled
away
the
time
,
and
kept
him
from
wondering
where
he
was
going
,
and
how
it
was
that
he
found
himself
in
such
an
odd
situation
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
this
would
have
worried
him
much
,
anyway
 
---
he
was
a
mighty
free
and
easy
,
roving
,
devil
-
may
-
care
sort
of
person
,
was
my
uncle
,
gentlemen
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
of
a
sudden
the
coach
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hollo
!
"
said
my
uncle
,
"
what
's
in
the
wind
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
Alight
here
,
"
said
the
guard
,
letting
down
the
steps
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Here
!
"
cried
my
uncle
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Here
,
"
rejoined
the
guard
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
'll
do
nothing
of
the
sort
,
"
said
my
uncle
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Very
well
,
then
stop
where
you
are
,
"
said
the
guard
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
will
,
"
said
my
uncle
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Do
,
"
said
the
guard
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
passengers
had
regarded
this
colloquy
with
great
attention
,
and
,
finding
that
my
uncle
was
determined
not
to
alight
,
the
younger
man
squeezed
past
him
,
to
hand
the
lady
out
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
the
ill
-
looking
man
was
inspecting
the
hole
in
the
crown
of
his
three
-
cornered
hat
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
young
lady
brushed
past
,
she
dropped
one
of
her
gloves
into
my
uncle
's
hand
,
and
softly
whispered
,
with
her
lips
so
close
to
his
face
that
he
felt
her
warm
breath
on
his
nose
,
the
single
word
"
Help
!
"
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
my
uncle
leaped
out
of
the
coach
at
once
,
with
such
violence
that
it
rocked
on
the
springs
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Oh
!
you
've
thought
better
of
it
,
have
you
?
"
said
the
guard
,
when
he
saw
my
uncle
standing
on
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
looked
at
the
guard
for
a
few
seconds
,
in
some
doubt
whether
it
would
n't
be
better
to
wrench
his
blunderbuss
from
him
,
fire
it
in
the
face
of
the
man
with
the
big
sword
,
knock
the
rest
of
the
company
over
the
head
with
the
stock
,
snatch
up
the
young
lady
,
and
go
off
in
the
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
On
second
thoughts
,
however
,
he
abandoned
this
plan
,
as
being
a
shade
too
melodramatic
in
the
execution
,
and
followed
the
two
mysterious
men
,
who
,
keeping
the
lady
between
them
,
were
now
entering
an
old
house
in
front
of
which
the
coach
had
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
They
turned
into
the
passage
,
and
my
uncle
followed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
all
the
ruinous
and
desolate
places
my
uncle
had
ever
beheld
,
this
was
the
most
so
.
 
<EOS>
It
looked
as
if
it
had
once
been
a
large
house
of
entertainment
;
but
the
roof
had
fallen
in
,
in
many
places
,
and
the
stairs
were
steep
,
rugged
,
and
broken
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
huge
fireplace
in
the
room
into
which
they
walked
,
and
the
chimney
was
blackened
with
smoke
;
but
no
warm
blaze
lighted
it
up
now
.
 
<EOS>
The
white
feathery
dust
of
burned
wood
was
still
strewed
over
the
hearth
,
but
the
stove
was
cold
,
and
all
was
dark
and
gloomy
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Well
,
"
said
my
uncle
,
as
he
looked
about
him
,
"
a
mail
travelling
at
the
rate
of
six
miles
and
a
half
an
hour
,
and
stopping
for
an
indefinite
time
at
such
a
hole
as
this
,
is
rather
an
irregular
sort
of
proceeding
,
I
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
This
shall
be
made
known
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
write
to
the
papers
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
said
this
in
a
pretty
loud
voice
,
and
in
an
open
,
unreserved
sort
of
manner
,
with
the
view
of
engaging
the
two
strangers
in
conversation
if
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
neither
of
them
took
any
more
notice
of
him
than
whispering
to
each
other
,
and
scowling
at
him
as
they
did
so
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
was
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
,
and
once
she
ventured
to
wave
her
hand
,
as
if
beseeching
my
uncle
's
assistance
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
length
the
two
strangers
advanced
a
little
,
and
the
conversation
began
in
earnest
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
You
do
n't
know
this
is
a
private
room
,
I
suppose
,
fellow
?
"
said
the
gentleman
in
sky
-
blue
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
No
,
I
do
not
,
fellow
,
"
rejoined
my
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
,
if
this
is
a
private
room
specially
ordered
for
the
occasion
,
I
should
think
the
public
room
must
be
a
VERY
comfortable
one
;
"
with
this
,
my
uncle
sat
himself
down
in
a
high
-
backed
chair
,
and
took
such
an
accurate
measure
of
the
gentleman
,
with
his
eyes
,
that
Tiggin
and
Welps
could
have
supplied
him
with
printed
calico
for
a
suit
,
and
not
an
inch
too
much
or
too
little
,
from
that
estimate
alone
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Quit
this
room
,
"
said
both
men
together
,
grasping
their
swords
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Eh
?
"
said
my
uncle
,
not
at
all
appearing
to
comprehend
their
meaning
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Quit
the
room
,
or
you
are
a
dead
man
,
"
said
the
ill
-
looking
fellow
with
the
large
sword
,
drawing
it
at
the
same
time
and
flourishing
it
in
the
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Down
with
him
!
"
cried
the
gentleman
in
sky
-
blue
,
drawing
his
sword
also
,
and
falling
back
two
or
three
yards
.
 
<EOS>
"
Down
with
him
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
lady
gave
a
loud
scream
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
uncle
was
always
remarkable
for
great
boldness
,
and
great
presence
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
time
that
he
had
appeared
so
indifferent
to
what
was
going
on
,
he
had
been
looking
slily
about
for
some
missile
or
weapon
of
defence
,
and
at
the
very
instant
when
the
swords
were
drawn
,
he
espied
,
standing
in
the
chimneycorner
,
an
old
basket
-
hilted
rapier
in
a
rusty
scabbard
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
bound
,
my
uncle
caught
it
in
his
hand
,
drew
it
,
flourished
it
gallantly
above
his
head
,
called
aloud
to
the
lady
to
keep
out
of
the
way
,
hurled
the
chair
at
the
man
in
sky
-
blue
,
and
the
scabbard
at
the
man
in
plum
-
colour
,
and
taking
advantage
of
the
confusion
,
fell
upon
them
both
,
pell
-
mell
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
there
is
an
old
story
---
none
the
worse
for
being
true
---
regarding
a
fine
young
Irish
gentleman
,
who
being
asked
if
he
could
play
the
fiddle
,
<EOS>
replied
he
had
no
doubt
he
could
,
but
he
could
n't
exactly
say
,
for
certain
,
because
he
had
never
tried
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
not
inapplicable
to
my
uncle
and
his
fencing
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
never
had
a
sword
in
his
hand
before
,
except
once
when
he
played
Richard
the
Third
at
a
private
theatre
,
upon
which
occasion
it
was
arranged
with
Richmond
that
he
was
to
be
run
through
,
from
behind
,
without
showing
fight
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
But
here
he
was
,
cutting
and
slashing
with
two
experienced
swordsman
,
thrusting
,
and
guarding
,
and
poking
,
and
slicing
,
and
acquitting
himself
in
the
most
manful
and
dexterous
manner
possible
,
although
up
to
that
time
he
had
never
been
aware
that
he
had
the
least
notion
of
the
science
.
 
<EOS>
It
only
shows
how
true
the
old
saying
is
,
that
a
man
never
knows
what
he
can
do
till
he
tries
,
gentlemen
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
noise
of
the
combat
was
terrific
;
each
of
the
three
combatants
swearing
like
troopers
,
and
their
swords
clashing
with
as
much
noise
as
if
all
the
knives
and
steels
in
Newport
market
were
rattling
together
,
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
was
at
its
very
height
,
the
lady
(
to
encourage
my
uncle
most
probably
)
withdrew
her
hood
entirely
from
her
face
,
and
disclosed
a
countenance
of
such
dazzling
beauty
,
that
he
would
have
fought
against
fifty
men
,
to
win
one
smile
from
it
and
die
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
done
wonders
before
,
but
now
he
began
to
powder
away
like
a
raving
mad
giant
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
this
very
moment
,
the
gentleman
in
sky
-
blue
turning
round
,
and
seeing
the
young
lady
with
her
face
uncovered
,
vented
an
exclamation
of
rage
and
jealousy
,
and
,
turning
his
weapon
against
her
beautiful
bosom
,
pointed
a
thrust
at
her
heart
,
which
caused
my
uncle
to
utter
a
cry
of
apprehension
that
made
the
building
ring
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
stepped
lightly
aside
,
and
snatching
the
young
man
's
sword
from
his
hand
,
before
he
had
recovered
his
balance
,
drove
him
to
the
wall
,
and
running
it
through
him
,
and
the
panelling
,
up
to
the
very
hilt
,
pinned
him
there
,
hard
and
fast
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
splendid
example
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
with
a
loud
shout
of
triumph
,
and
a
strength
that
was
irresistible
,
made
his
adversary
retreat
in
the
same
direction
,
and
plunging
the
old
rapier
into
the
very
centre
of
a
large
red
flower
in
the
pattern
of
his
waistcoat
,
nailed
him
beside
his
friend
;
there
they
both
stood
,
gentlemen
,
jerking
their
arms
and
legs
about
in
agony
,
like
the
toy
-
shop
figures
that
are
moved
by
a
piece
of
pack
-
thread
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
always
said
,
afterwards
,
that
this
was
one
of
the
surest
means
he
knew
of
,
for
disposing
of
an
enemy
;
but
it
was
liable
to
one
objection
on
the
ground
of
expense
,
inasmuch
as
it
involved
the
loss
of
a
sword
for
every
man
disabled
.
   
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
The
mail
,
the
mail

"
cried
the
lady
,
running
up
to
my
uncle
and
throwing
her
beautiful
arms
round
his
neck
;
"
we
may
yet
escape
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
"
May

"
cried
my
uncle
;
"
why
,
my
dear
,
there
's
nobody
else
to
kill
,
is
there
?
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
was
rather
disappointed
,
gentlemen
,
for
he
thought
a
little
quiet
bit
of
love
-
making
would
be
agreeable
after
the
slaughtering
,
if
it
were
only
to
change
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
We
have
not
an
instant
to
lose
here
,
"
said
the
young
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
(
pointing
to
the
young
gentleman
in
sky
-
blue
)
is
the
only
son
of
the
powerful
Marquess
of
Filletoville
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
Well
then
,
my
dear
,
I
'm
afraid
he
'll
never
come
to
the
title
,
"
said
my
uncle
,
looking
coolly
at
the
young
gentleman
as
he
stood
fixed
up
against
the
wall
,
in
the
cockchafer
fashion
that
I
have
described
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
cut
off
the
entail
,
my
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
have
been
torn
from
my
home
and
my
friends
by
these
villains
,
"
said
the
young
lady
,
her
features
glowing
with
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
That
wretch
would
have
married
me
by
violence
in
another
hour
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
Confound
his
impudence
!
"
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
,
bestowing
a
very
contemptuous
look
on
the
dying
heir
of
Filletoville
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
As
you
may
guess
from
what
you
have
seen
,
"
said
the
young
lady
,
"
the
party
were
prepared
to
murder
me
if
I
appealed
to
any
one
for
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
If
their
accomplices
find
us
here

we
are
lost

<EOS>
Two
minutes
hence
may
be
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
The
mail
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
overpowered
by
her
feelings
,
and
the
exertion
of
sticking
the
young
Marquess
of
Filletoville
,
she
sank
into
my
uncle
's
arms
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
caught
her
up
,
and
bore
her
to
the
house
door
.
<EOS>
There
stood
the
mail
,
with
four
long
-
tailed
,
flowing
-
maned
,
black
horses
,
ready
harnessed
;
but
no
coachman

no
guard

no

"
Gentlemen
,
I
hope
I
do
no
injustice
to
my
uncle
's
memory
,
when
I
express
my
opinion
,
that
although
he
was
a
bachelor
,
he
had
held
some
ladies
in
his
arms
before
this
time
;
I
believe
,
indeed
,
that
he
had
rather
a
habit
of
kissing
barmaids
;
and
I
know
,
that
in
one
or
two
instances
,
he
had
been
seen
by
credible
witnesses
,
to
hug
a
landlady
in
a
very
perceptible
manner
.
 
<EOS>
I
mention
the
circumstance
,
to
show
what
a
very
uncommon
sort
of
person
<EOS>
this
beautiful
young
lady
must
have
been
,
to
have
affected
my
uncle
in
the
way
she
did
;
he
used
to
say
,
that
as
her
long
dark
hair
trailed
over
his
arm
,
and
her
beautiful
dark
eyes
fixed
themselves
upon
his
face
when
she
recovered
,
he
felt
so
strange
and
nervous
that
his
legs
trembled
beneath
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
who
can
look
in
a
sweet
,
soft
pair
of
dark
eyes
,
without
feeling
queer
?
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
,
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
to
look
at
some
eyes
I
know
,
and
that
's
the
truth
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
You
will
never
leave
me
,
"
murmured
the
young
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Never
,
"
said
my
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
meant
it
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
My
dear
preserver
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
kind
,
brave
preserver
!
<EOS>
"
   
"
"
Do
n't
,
"
said
my
uncle
,
interrupting
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
"
Why
?
"
inquired
the
young
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Because
your
mouth
looks
so
beautiful
when
you
speak
,
"
rejoined
my
uncle
,
"
that
I
'm
afraid
I
shall
be
rude
enough
to
kiss
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
young
lady
put
up
her
hand
as
if
to
caution
my
uncle
not
to
do
so
,
and
said
---
 
No
,
she
did
n't
say
anything
---
she
smiled
.
<EOS>
When
you
are
looking
at
a
pair
of
the
most
delicious
lips
in
the
world
,
and
see
them
gently
break
into
a
roguish
smile
---
if
you
are
very
near
them
,
and
nobody
else
by
---
you
can
not
better
testify
your
admiration
of
their
beautiful
form
and
colour
than
by
kissing
them
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
did
so
,
and
I
honour
him
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Hark
!
"
cried
the
young
lady
,
starting
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
noise
of
wheels
,
and
horses
!
<EOS>
"
   
"
"
So
it
is
,
"
said
my
uncle
,
listening
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
good
ear
for
wheels
,
and
the
trampling
of
hoofs
;
but
there
appeared
to
be
so
many
horses
and
carriages
rattling
towards
them
,
from
a
distance
,
that
it
was
impossible
to
form
a
guess
at
their
number
.
 
<EOS>
The
sound
was
like
that
of
fifty
brakes
,
with
six
blood
cattle
in
each
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
We
are
pursued
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
young
lady
,
clasping
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
pursued
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
hope
<EOS>
but
in
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
was
such
an
expression
of
terror
in
her
beautiful
face
,
that
my
uncle
made
up
his
mind
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
He
lifted
her
into
the
coach
,
told
her
not
to
be
frightened
,
pressed
his
lips
to
hers
once
more
,
and
then
advising
her
to
draw
up
the
window
to
keep
the
cold
air
out
,
mounted
to
the
box
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Stay
,
love
,
"
cried
the
young
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
said
my
uncle
,
from
the
coach
-
box
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
,
"
said
the
young
lady
;
"
only
a
word
.
<EOS>
Only
one
word
,
dearest
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
"
Must
I
get
down
?
"
inquired
my
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
made
no
answer
,
but
she
smiled
again
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
smile
,
gentlemen
!
 
<EOS>
It
beat
the
other
one
,
all
to
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
descended
from
his
perch
in
a
twinkling
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
What
is
it
,
my
dear
?
"
said
my
uncle
,
looking
in
at
the
coach
window
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
happened
to
bend
forward
at
the
same
time
,
and
my
uncle
thought
she
looked
more
beautiful
than
she
had
done
yet
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
close
to
her
just
then
,
gentlemen
,
so
he
really
ought
to
know
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
What
is
it
,
my
dear
?
"
said
my
uncle
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Will
you
never
love
any
one
<EOS>
but
me
---
never
marry
any
one
beside
?
"
said
the
young
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
swore
a
great
oath
that
he
never
would
marry
anybody
else
,
and
the
young
lady
drew
in
her
head
,
and
pulled
up
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
He
jumped
upon
the
box
,
squared
his
elbows
,
adjusted
the
ribands
,
seized
the
whip
which
lay
on
the
roof
,
gave
one
flick
to
the
off
leader
,
and
away
went
the
four
long
-
tailed
,
flowing
-
maned
black
horses
,
at
fifteen
good
English
miles
an
hour
,
with
the
old
mail
-
coach
behind
them
.
 
<EOS>
Whew
!
 
<EOS>
How
they
tore
along
!
   
<EOS>
"
The
noise
behind
grew
louder
.
 
<EOS>
The
faster
the
old
mail
went
,
the
faster
came
the
pursuers
---
men
,
horses
,
dogs
,
were
leagued
in
the
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
The
noise
was
frightful
,
but
,
above
all
,
rose
the
voice
of
the
young
lady
,
urging
my
uncle
on
,
and
shrieking
,
"
Faster
!
 
<EOS>
Faster
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
whirled
past
the
dark
trees
,
as
feathers
would
be
swept
before
a
hurricane
.
 
<EOS>
Houses
,
gates
,
churches
,
haystacks
,
objects
of
every
kind
they
shot
by
,
with
a
velocity
and
noise
like
roaring
waters
suddenly
let
loose
.
 
<EOS>
But
still
the
noise
of
pursuit
grew
louder
,
and
still
my
uncle
could
hear
the
young
lady
wildly
screaming
,
"
<EOS>
Faster
!
 
<EOS>
Faster
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
plied
whip
and
rein
,
and
the
horses
flew
onward
till
they
were
white
with
foam
;
and
yet
the
noise
behind
increased
;
and
yet
the
young
lady
cried
,
"
Faster
!
 
<EOS>
Faster
!
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
gave
a
loud
stamp
on
the
boot
in
the
energy
of
the
moment
,
and
---
found
that
it
was
gray
morning
,
and
he
was
sitting
in
the
wheelwright
's
yard
,
on
the
box
of
an
old
Edinburgh
mail
,
shivering
with
the
cold
and
wet
and
stamping
his
feet
to
warm
them
!
 
<EOS>
He
got
down
,
and
looked
eagerly
inside
for
the
beautiful
young
lady
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
 
<EOS>
There
was
neither
door
nor
seat
to
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
mere
shell
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
my
uncle
knew
very
well
that
there
was
some
mystery
in
the
matter
,
and
that
everything
had
passed
exactly
as
he
used
to
relate
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
remained
staunch
to
the
great
oath
he
had
sworn
to
the
beautiful
young
lady
,
refusing
several
eligible
landladies
on
her
account
,
and
dying
a
bachelor
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
said
what
a
curious
thing
it
was
that
he
should
have
found
out
,
by
such
a
mere
accident
as
his
clambering
over
the
palings
,
that
the
ghosts
of
mail
-
coaches
and
horses
,
guards
,
coachmen
,
and
passengers
,
were
in
the
habit
of
making
journeys
regularly
every
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
used
to
add
,
that
he
believed
he
was
the
only
living
person
who
had
ever
been
taken
as
a
passenger
on
one
of
these
excursions
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
think
he
was
right
,
gentlemen
---
at
least
I
never
heard
of
any
other
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
these
ghosts
of
mail
-
coaches
carry
in
their
bags
,
"
said
the
landlord
,
who
had
listened
to
the
whole
story
with
profound
attention
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
dead
letters
,
of
course

said
the
bagman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
ah
!
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure

"
rejoined
the
landlord
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
thought
of
that

How
Mr
Pickwick
sped
upon
his
mission
,
and
how
he
was
reinforced
in
the
outset
by
a
most
unexpected
auxiliary
 
<EOS>
The
horses
were
put
to
,
punctually
at
a
quarter
before
nine
next
morning
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
and
Sam
Weller
<EOS>
having
each
taken
his
seat
,
the
one
inside
and
the
other
out
,
the
postillion
was
duly
directed
to
repair
in
the
first
instance
to
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
's
house
,
for
the
purpose
of
taking
up
Mr
Benjamin
Allen

<EOS>
It
was
with
feelings
of
no
small
astonishment
,
when
the
carriage
drew
up
before
the
door
with
the
red
lamp
,
and
the
very
legible
inscription
of
"
Sawyer
,
late
Nockemorf

that
Mr
Pickwick
saw
,
on
popping
his
head
out
of
the
coach
window
,
the
boy
in
the
gray
livery
very
busily
employed
in
putting
up
the
shutters
 
---
the
which
,
being
an
unusual
and
an
unbusinesslike
proceeding
at
that
hour
of
the
morning
,
at
once
suggested
to
his
mind
two
inferences
:
the
one
,
that
some
good
friend
and
patient
of
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
's
was
dead
;
the
other
,
that
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
himself
was
bankrupt
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
to
the
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
's
the
matter
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
boy
,
expanding
his
mouth
to
the
whole
breadth
of
his
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
all
right
!
"
cried
Bob
Sawyer
,
suddenly
appearing
at
the
door
,
with
a
small
leathern
knapsack
,
limp
and
dirty
,
in
one
hand
,
and
a
rough
coat
and
shawl
thrown
over
the
other
arm
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
going
,
old
fellow
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Bob
Sawyer
,
"
and
a
regular
expedition
we
'll
make
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
Sam
!
 
<EOS>
Look
out
!
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
briefly
bespeaking
Mr
Weller
's
attention
,
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
jerked
the
leathern
knapsack
into
the
dickey
,
where
it
was
immediately
stowed
away
,
under
the
seat
,
by
Sam
,
who
regarded
the
proceeding
with
great
admiration
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
with
the
assistance
of
the
boy
,
forcibly
worked
himself
into
the
rough
coat
,
which
was
a
few
sizes
too
small
for
him
,
and
then
advancing
to
the
coach
window
,
thrust
in
his
head
,
and
laughed
boisterously
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
start
it
is
,
is
n't
it
?
"
cried
Bob
,
wiping
the
tears
out
of
his
eyes
,
with
one
of
the
cuffs
of
the
rough
coat
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
some
embarrassment
,
"
I
had
no
idea
of
your
accompanying
us
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
that
's
just
the
very
thing
,
"
replied
Bob
,
seizing
Mr
Pickwick
by
the
lappel
of
his
coat
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
joke
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
's
the
joke
,
is
it
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
replied
Bob
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
whole
point
of
the
thing
,
you
know
---
that
,
and
leaving
the
business
to
take
care
of
itself
,
as
it
seems
to
have
made
up
its
mind
not
to
take
care
of
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
explanation
of
the
phenomenon
of
the
shutters
,
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
pointed
to
the
shop
,
and
relapsed
into
an
ecstasy
of
mirth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
me
,
you
are
surely
not
mad
enough
to
think
of
leaving
your
patients
without
anybody
to
attend
them
!
"
<EOS>
remonstrated
Mr
Pickwick
in
a
very
serious
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
asked
Bob
,
in
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
save
by
it
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
None
of
them
ever
pay
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
"
said
Bob
,
lowering
his
voice
to
a
confidential
whisper
,
"
they
will
be
all
the
better
for
it
;
for
,
being
nearly
out
of
drugs
,
and
not
able
to
increase
my
account
just
now
,
I
should
have
been
obliged
to
give
them
calomel
all
round
,
and
it
would
have
been
certain
to
have
disagreed
with
some
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
So
it
's
all
for
the
best
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
philosophy
and
a
strength
of
reasoning
about
this
reply
,
which
Mr
Pickwick
was
not
prepared
for
.
 
<EOS>
He
paused
a
few
moments
,
and
added
,
less
firmly
than
before
---
   
"
<EOS>
But
this
chaise
,
my
young
friend
,
will
only
hold
two
;
and
I
am
pledged
to
Mr
Allen
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
think
of
me
for
a
minute
,
"
replied
Bob
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
arranged
it
all
;
Sam
and
I
will
share
the
dickey
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
Look
here
.
<EOS>
This
little
bill
is
to
be
wafered
on
the
shop
door
:
"
Sawyer
,
late
Nockemorf
.
 
<EOS>
Inquire
of
Mrs
Cripps
over
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Cripps
is
my
boy
's
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Sawyer
's
very
sorry
,
"
says
Mrs
Cripps
,
"
could
n't
help
it
---
fetched
away
early
this
morning
to
a
consultation
of
the
very
first
surgeons
in
the
country
---
could
n't
do
without
him
---
would
have
him
at
any
price
---
tremendous
operation
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
"
said
Bob
,
in
conclusion
,
"
it
'll
do
me
more
good
than
otherwise
,
I
expect
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
gets
into
one
of
the
local
papers
,
it
will
be
the
making
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
Ben
;
now
then
,
jump
in
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
hurried
words
,
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
pushed
the
postboy
on
one
side
,
jerked
his
friend
into
the
vehicle
,
slammed
the
door
,
put
up
the
steps
,
wafered
the
bill
on
the
street
door
,
locked
it
,
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
,
jumped
into
the
dickey
,
gave
the
word
for
starting
,
and
did
the
whole
with
such
extraordinary
precipitation
,
that
before
Mr
Pickwick
had
well
begun
to
consider
whether
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
ought
to
go
or
not
,
they
were
rolling
away
,
with
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
thoroughly
established
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
equipage
.
   
<EOS>
So
long
as
their
progress
was
confined
to
the
streets
of
Bristol
,
the
facetious
Bob
kept
his
professional
green
spectacles
on
,
and
conducted
himself
with
becoming
steadiness
and
gravity
of
demeanour
;
merely
giving
utterance
to
divers
verbal
witticisms
for
the
exclusive
behoof
and
entertainment
of
Mr
Samuel
Weller
.
<EOS>
But
when
they
emerged
on
the
open
road
,
he
threw
off
his
green
spectacles
and
his
gravity
together
,
and
performed
a
great
variety
of
practical
jokes
,
which
were
calculated
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
passersby
,
and
to
render
the
carriage
and
those
it
contained
objects
of
more
than
ordinary
curiosity
;
the
least
conspicuous
among
these
feats
being
a
most
vociferous
imitation
of
a
key
-
bugle
,
and
the
ostentatious
display
of
a
crimson
silk
pocket
-
handkerchief
attached
to
a
walking
-
stick
,
which
was
occasionally
waved
in
the
air
with
various
gestures
indicative
of
supremacy
and
defiance
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
stopping
in
the
midst
of
a
most
sedate
conversation
with
Ben
Allen
,
bearing
reference
to
the
numerous
good
qualities
of
Mr
Winkle
and
his
sister
---
"
I
wonder
what
all
the
people
we
pass
,
can
see
in
us
to
make
them
stare
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
neat
turn
-
out
,
"
replied
Ben
Allen
,
with
something
of
pride
in
his
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
're
not
used
to
see
this
sort
of
thing
,
every
day
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Possibly
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
might
very
probably
have
reasoned
himself
into
the
belief
that
it
really
was
,
had
he
not
,
just
then
happening
to
look
out
of
the
coach
window
,
observed
that
the
looks
of
the
passengers
betokened
anything
but
respectful
astonishment
,
and
that
various
telegraphic
communications
appeared
to
be
passing
between
them
and
some
persons
outside
the
vehicle
,
whereupon
it
occurred
to
him
that
these
demonstrations
might
be
,
in
some
remote
degree
,
referable
to
the
humorous
deportment
of
Mr
Robert
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
that
our
volatile
friend
is
committing
no
absurdities
in
that
dickey
behind
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no
,
"
replied
Ben
Allen
.
 
<EOS>
"
Except
when
he
's
elevated
,
Bob
's
the
quietest
creature
breathing
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
a
prolonged
imitation
of
a
key
-
bugle
broke
upon
the
ear
,
succeeded
by
cheers
and
screams
,
all
of
which
evidently
proceeded
from
the
throat
and
lungs
of
the
quietest
creature
breathing
,
or
in
plainer
designation
,
of
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
himself
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Ben
Allen
looked
expressively
at
each
other
,
and
the
former
gentleman
taking
off
his
hat
,
and
leaning
out
of
the
coach
window
until
nearly
the
whole
of
his
waistcoat
was
outside
it
,
was
at
length
enabled
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
his
facetious
friend
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
was
seated
,
not
in
the
dickey
,
but
on
the
roof
of
the
chaise
,
with
his
legs
as
far
asunder
as
they
would
conveniently
go
,
wearing
Mr
Samuel
Weller
's
hat
on
one
side
of
his
head
,
and
bearing
,
in
one
hand
,
a
most
enormous
sandwich
,
while
,
in
the
other
,
he
supported
a
goodly
-
sized
case
-
bottle
,
to
both
of
which
he
applied
himself
with
intense
relish
,
varying
the
monotony
of
the
occupation
by
an
occasional
howl
,
or
the
interchange
of
some
lively
badinage
with
any
passing
stranger
.
<EOS>
The
crimson
flag
was
carefully
tied
in
an
erect
position
to
the
rail
of
the
dickey
;
and
Mr
Samuel
Weller
,
decorated
with
Bob
Sawyer
's
hat
,
was
seated
in
the
centre
thereof
,
discussing
a
twin
sandwich
,
with
an
animated
countenance
,
the
expression
of
which
betokened
his
entire
and
perfect
approval
of
the
whole
arrangement
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
enough
to
irritate
a
gentleman
with
Mr
Pickwick
's
sense
of
propriety
,
but
it
was
not
the
whole
extent
of
the
aggravation
,
for
a
stage
-
coach
full
,
inside
and
out
,
was
meeting
them
at
the
moment
,
and
the
astonishment
of
the
passengers
was
very
palpably
evinced
.
 
<EOS>
The
congratulations
of
an
Irish
family
,
too
,
who
were
keeping
up
with
the
chaise
,
and
begging
all
the
time
,
were
of
rather
a
boisterous
description
,
especially
those
of
its
male
head
,
who
appeared
to
consider
the
display
as
part
and
parcel
of
some
political
or
other
procession
of
triumph
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Sawyer
!
"
cried
Mr
Pickwick
,
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
,
"
Mr
Sawyer
,
Sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
!
"
responded
that
gentleman
,
looking
over
the
side
of
the
chaise
with
all
the
coolness
in
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
mad
,
sir
?
"
demanded
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
"
replied
Bob
;
"
only
cheerful
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cheerful
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
down
that
scandalous
red
handkerchief
,
I
beg
.
 
<EOS>
I
insist
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
,
take
it
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
Before
Sam
could
interpose
,
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
gracefully
struck
his
colours
,
and
having
put
them
in
his
pocket
,
nodded
in
a
courteous
manner
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
wiped
the
mouth
of
the
case
-
bottle
,
and
applied
it
to
his
own
,
thereby
informing
him
,
without
any
unnecessary
waste
of
words
,
that
he
devoted
that
draught
to
wishing
him
all
manner
of
happiness
and
prosperity
.
 
<EOS>
Having
done
this
,
Bob
replaced
the
cork
with
great
care
,
and
looking
benignantly
down
on
Mr
Pickwick
,
took
a
large
bite
out
of
the
sandwich
,
and
smiled
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
whose
momentary
anger
was
not
quite
proof
against
Bob
's
immovable
self
-
possession
,
"
pray
let
us
have
no
more
of
this
absurdity
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
replied
Bob
,
once
more
exchanging
hats
with
Mr
Weller
;
"
I
did
n't
mean
to
do
it
,
only
I
got
so
enlivened
with
the
ride
that
I
could
n't
help
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Think
of
the
look
of
the
thing
,
"
expostulated
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
have
some
regard
to
appearances
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
,
"
said
Bob
,
"
it
's
not
the
sort
of
thing
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
All
over
,
governor
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Satisfied
with
this
assurance
,
Mr
Pickwick
once
more
drew
his
head
into
the
chaise
and
pulled
up
the
glass
;
but
he
had
scarcely
resumed
the
conversation
which
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
had
interrupted
,
when
he
was
somewhat
startled
by
the
apparition
of
a
small
dark
body
,
of
an
oblong
form
,
on
the
outside
of
the
window
,
which
gave
sundry
taps
against
it
,
as
if
impatient
of
admission
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
this
?
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
looks
like
a
case
-
bottle
;
"
remarked
Ben
Allen
,
eyeing
the
object
in
question
through
his
spectacles
with
some
interest
;
"
I
rather
think
it
belongs
to
Bob
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
impression
was
perfectly
accurate
;
for
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
having
attached
the
case
-
bottle
to
the
end
of
the
walking
-
stick
,
was
battering
the
window
with
it
,
in
token
of
his
wish
,
that
his
friends
inside
would
partake
of
its
contents
,
in
all
good
-
fellowship
and
harmony
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
to
be
done
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
at
the
bottle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
proceeding
is
more
absurd
than
the
other
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
would
be
best
to
take
it
in
,
"
replied
Mr
Ben
Allen
;
"
it
would
serve
him
right
to
take
it
in
and
keep
it
,
would
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
shall
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
the
most
proper
course
<EOS>
we
could
possibly
adopt
,
"
replied
Ben
.
   
<EOS>
This
advice
quite
coinciding
with
his
own
opinion
,
Mr
Pickwick
gently
let
down
the
window
and
disengaged
the
bottle
from
the
stick
;
upon
which
the
latter
was
drawn
up
,
and
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
was
heard
to
laugh
heartily
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
merry
dog
it
is
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
round
at
his
companion
,
with
the
bottle
in
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
,
"
said
Mr
Allen
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
possibly
be
angry
with
him
,
"
remarked
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
out
of
the
question
,
"
observed

During
this
short
interchange
of
sentiments
,
Mr
Pickwick
had
,
in
an
abstracted
mood
,
uncorked
the
bottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Ben
Allen
carelessly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
equal
carelessness
.
<EOS>
"
It
smells
,
I
think
,
like
milk
-
punch
.
"
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
indeed
?
"
said
Ben
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
THINK
so
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Pickwick
,
very
properly
guarding
himself
against
the
possibility
of
stating
an
untruth
;
"
mind
,
I
could
not
undertake
to
say
certainly
,
without
tasting
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
do
so
,
"
said
Ben
;
"
we
may
as
well
know
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
so
?
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
;
if
you
are
curious
to
know
,
of
course
I
have
no
objection
.
"
   
<EOS>
Ever
willing
to
sacrifice
his
own
feelings
to
the
wishes
of
his
friend
,
Mr
Pickwick
at
once
took
a
pretty
long
taste
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Ben
Allen
,
interrupting
him
with
some
impatience
.
   
<EOS>
"
Curious
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
smacking
his
lips
,
"
I
hardly
know
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
after
a
second
taste
.
<EOS>
"
It
IS
punch
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Ben
Allen
looked
at
Mr
Pickwick
;
Mr
Pickwick
looked
at
Mr
Ben
Allen
;
Mr
Ben
Allen
smiled
;
Mr
Pickwick
did
not
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
serve
him
right
,
"
said
the
last
-
named
gentleman
,
with
some
severity
---
"
it
would
serve
him
right
to
drink
it
every
drop
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
very
thing
that
occurred
to
me
,
"
said
Ben
Allen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
,
indeed
?
"
rejoined
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
here
's
his
health
!
"
 
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
that
excellent
person
took
a
most
energetic
pull
at
the
bottle
,
and
handed
it
to
Ben
Allen
,
who
was
not
slow
to
imitate
his
example
.
 
<EOS>
The
smiles
became
mutual
,
and
the
milk
-
punch
was
gradually
and
cheerfully
disposed
of
.
   
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
he
drained
the
last
drop
,
"
his
pranks
are
really
very
amusing
;
very
entertaining
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
that
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Ben
Allen
.
 
<EOS>
In
proof
of
Bob
Sawyer
's
being
<EOS>
one
of
the
funniest
fellows
alive
,
he
proceeded
to
entertain
Mr
Pickwick
with
a
long
and
circumstantial
account
how
that
gentleman
once
drank
himself
into
a
fever
and
got
his
head
shaved
;
the
relation
of
which
pleasant
and
agreeable
history
was
only
stopped
by
the
stoppage
of
the
chaise
at
the
Bell
at
Berkeley
Heath
,
to
change
horses
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
 
<EOS>
We
're
going
to
dine
here
,
are
n't
we
?
"
<EOS>
said
Bob
,
looking
in
at
the
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dine
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
we
have
only
come
nineteen
miles
,
and
have
eighty
-
seven
and
a
half
to
go
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
the
reason
why
we
should
take
something
to
enable
us
to
bear
up
against
the
fatigue
,
"
remonstrated
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
quite
impossible
to
dine
at
half
-
past
eleven
o'clock
in
the
day
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
it
is
,
"
rejoined
Bob
,
"
lunch
is
the
very
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Hollo
,
you
sir
!
<EOS>
Lunch
for
three
,
directly
;
and
keep
the
horses
back
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
them
to
put
everything
they
have
cold
,
on
the
table
,
and
some
bottled
ale
,
and
let
us
taste
your
very
best
Madeira
.
"
 
<EOS>
Issuing
these
orders
with
monstrous
importance
and
bustle
,
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
at
once
hurried
into
the
house
to
superintend
the
arrangements
;
in
less
than
five
minutes
he
returned
and
declared
them
to
be
excellent
.
   
<EOS>
The
quality
of
the
lunch
fully
justified
the
eulogium
which
Bob
had
pronounced
,
and
very
great
justice
was
done
to
it
,
not
only
by
that
gentleman
,
but
Mr
Ben
Allen
and
Mr
Pickwick
also
.
 
<EOS>
Under
the
auspices
of
the
three
,
the
bottled
ale
and
the
Madeira
were
promptly
disposed
of
;
and
when
(
the
horses
being
once
more
put
to
)
<EOS>
they
resumed
their
seats
,
with
the
case
-
bottle
full
of
the
best
substitute
for
milk
-
punch
that
could
be
procured
on
so
short
a
notice
,
the
key
-
bugle
sounded
,
and
the
red
flag
waved
,
without
the
slightest
opposition
on
Mr
Pickwick
's
part
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
Hop
Pole
at
Tewkesbury
,
they
stopped
to
dine
;
upon
which
occasion
there
was
more
bottled
ale
,
with
some
more
Madeira
,
and
some
port
besides
;
and
here
the
case
-
bottle
was
replenished
for
the
fourth
time
.
 
<EOS>
Under
the
influence
of
these
combined
stimulants
,
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Ben
Allen
fell
fast
asleep
for
thirty
miles
,
while
Bob
and
Mr
Weller
sang
duets
in
the
dickey
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
quite
dark
when
Mr
Pickwick
roused
himself
sufficiently
to
look
out
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
The
straggling
cottages
by
the
road
-
side
,
the
dingy
hue
of
every
object
visible
,
the
murky
atmosphere
,
the
paths
of
cinders
and
brick
-
dust
,
the
deep
-
red
glow
of
furnace
fires
in
the
distance
,
the
volumes
of
dense
smoke
issuing
heavily
forth
from
high
toppling
chimneys
,
blackening
and
obscuring
everything
around
;
the
glare
of
distant
lights
,
the
ponderous
wagons
which
toiled
along
the
road
,
laden
with
clashing
rods
of
iron
,
or
piled
with
heavy
goods
---
all
betokened
their
rapid
approach
to
the
great
working
town
of
Birmingham
.
   
<EOS>
As
they
rattled
through
the
narrow
thoroughfares
leading
to
the
heart
of
the
turmoil
,
the
sights
and
sounds
of
earnest
occupation
struck
more
forcibly
on
the
senses
.
 
<EOS>
The
streets
were
thronged
with
working
people
.
 
<EOS>
The
hum
of
labour
resounded
from
every
house
;
lights
gleamed
from
the
long
casement
windows
in
the
attic
storeys
,
and
the
whirl
of
wheels
and
noise
of
machinery
shook
the
trembling
walls
.
 
<EOS>
The
fires
,
whose
lurid
,
sullen
light
had
been
visible
for
miles
,
blazed
fiercely
up
,
in
the
great
works
and
factories
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
The
din
of
hammers
,
the
rushing
of
steam
,
and
the
dead
heavy
clanking
of
engines
,
was
the
harsh
music
which
arose
from
every
quarter
.
<EOS>
The
postboy
was
driving
briskly
through
the
open
streets
,
and
past
the
handsome
and
well
-
lighted
shops
that
intervene
between
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
the
Old
Royal
Hotel
,
before
Mr
Pickwick
had
begun
to
consider
the
very
difficult
and
delicate
nature
of
the
commission
which
had
carried
him
thither
.
   
<EOS>
The
delicate
nature
of
this
commission
,
and
the
difficulty
of
executing
it
in
a
satisfactory
manner
,
were
by
no
means
lessened
by
the
voluntary
companionship
of
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
.
 
<EOS>
Truth
to
tell
<EOS>
,
Mr
Pickwick
felt
that
his
presence
on
the
occasion
,
however
considerate
and
gratifying
,
was
by
no
means
an
honour
he
would
willingly
have
sought
;
in
fact
,
he
would
cheerfully
have
given
a
reasonable
sum
of
money
to
have
had
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
removed
to
any
place
at
not
less
than
fifty
miles
"
distance
,
without
delay
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
had
never
held
any
personal
communication
with
Mr
Winkle
,
senior
,
although
he
had
once
or
twice
corresponded
with
him
by
letter
,
and
returned
satisfactory
answers
to
his
inquiries
concerning
the
moral
character
and
behaviour
of
his
son
;
he
felt
nervously
sensible
that
to
wait
upon
him
,
for
the
first
time
,
attended
by
Bob
Sawyer
and
Ben
Allen
,
both
slightly
fuddled
,
was
not
the
most
ingenious
and
likely
means
that
could
have
been
hit
upon
to
prepossess
him
in
his
favour
.
   
<EOS>
"
However
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
endeavouring
to
reassure
himself
,
"
I
must
do
the
best
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
see
him
to
-
night
,
for
I
faithfully
promised
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
persist
in
accompanying
me
,
I
must
make
the
interview
as
brief
as
possible
,
and
be
content
that
,
for
their
own
sakes
,
they
will
not
expose
themselves
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
comforted
himself
with
these
reflections
,
the
chaise
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
Old
Royal
.
 
<EOS>
Ben
Allen
having
been
partially
awakened
from
a
stupendous
sleep
,
and
dragged
out
by
the
collar
by
Mr
Samuel
Weller
,
Mr
Pickwick
was
enabled
to
alight
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
shown
to
a
comfortable
apartment
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
at
once
propounded
a
question
to
the
waiter
concerning
the
whereabout
of
Mr
Winkle
's
residence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Close
by
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
waiter
,
"
not
above
five
hundred
yards
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
is
a
wharfinger
,
Sir
,
at
the
canal
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Private
residence
is
not
---
oh
dear
,
no
,
sir
,
not
five
hundred
yards
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
Here
the
waiter
blew
a
candle
out
,
and
made
a
feint
of
lighting
it
again
,
in
order
to
afford
Mr
Pickwick
an
opportunity
of
asking
any
further
questions
,
if
he
felt
so
disposed
.
<EOS>
"
Take
anything
now
,
Sir
?
"
said
the
waiter
,
lighting
the
candle
in
desperation
at
Mr
Pickwick
's
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tea
or
coffee
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
Dinner
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Like
to
order
supper
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Very
good
,
Sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
,
he
walked
slowly
to
the
door
,
and
then
stopping
short
,
turned
round
and
said
,
with
great
suavity
---
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
send
the
chambermaid
,
gentlemen
?
"
   
"
You
may
if
you
please
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
YOU
please
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
bring
some
soda
-
water
,
"
said
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Soda
-
water
,
Sir
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
Sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
his
mind
apparently
relieved
from
an
overwhelming
weight
,
by
having
at
last
got
an
order
for
something
,
the
waiter
imperceptibly
melted
away
.
 
<EOS>
Waiters
never
walk
or
run
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
a
peculiar
and
mysterious
power
of
skimming
out
of
rooms
,
which
other
mortals
possess
not
.
   
<EOS>
Some
slight
symptoms
of
vitality
having
been
awakened
in
Mr
Ben
Allen
by
the
soda
-
water
,
he
suffered
himself
to
be
prevailed
upon
to
wash
his
face
and
hands
,
and
to
submit
to
be
brushed
by
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
and
Bob
Sawyer
having
also
repaired
the
disorder
which
the
journey
had
made
in
their
apparel
,
the
three
started
forth
,
arm
in
arm
,
to
Mr
Winkle
's
;
Bob
Sawyer
impregnating
the
atmosphere
with
tobacco
smoke
as
he
walked
along
.
   
<EOS>
About
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
,
in
a
quiet
,
substantial
-
looking
street
,
stood
an
old
red
brick
house
with
three
steps
before
the
door
,
and
a
brass
plate
upon
it
,
bearing
,
in
fat
Roman
capitals
,
the
words
,
"
Mr
Winkle
.
<EOS>
"
The
steps
were
very
white
,
and
the
bricks
were
very
red
,
and
the
house
was
very
clean
;
and
here
stood
Mr
Pickwick
,
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
,
and
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
as
the
clock
struck
ten
.
   
<EOS>
A
smart
servant
-
girl
answered
the
knock
,
and
started
on
beholding
the
three
strangers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr
Winkle
at
home
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
just
going
to
supper
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"
Give
him
that
card
if
you
please
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
"
Say
I
am
sorry
to
trouble
him
at
so
late
an
hour
;
but
I
am
anxious
to
see
him
to
-
night
,
and
have
only
just
arrived
.
<EOS>
"
The
girl
looked
timidly
at
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
who
was
expressing
his
admiration
of
her
personal
charms
by
a
variety
of
wonderful
grimaces
;
and
casting
an
eye
at
the
hats
and
greatcoats
which
hung
in
the
passage
,
called
another
girl
to
mind
the
door
while
she
went
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
The
sentinel
was
speedily
relieved
;
for
the
girl
returned
immediately
,
and
begging
pardon
of
the
gentlemen
for
leaving
them
in
the
street
,
ushered
them
into
a
floor
-
clothed
back
parlour
,
half
office
and
half
dressing
room
,
in
which
the
principal
useful
and
ornamental
articles
of
furniture
were
a
desk
,
a
wash
-
hand
stand
and
shaving
-
glass
,
a
boot
-
rack
and
boot
-
jack
,
a
high
stool
,
four
chairs
,
a
table
,
and
an
old
eight
-
day
clock
.
 
<EOS>
Over
the
mantelpiece
were
the
sunken
doors
of
an
iron
safe
,
while
a
couple
of
hanging
shelves
for
books
,
an
almanac
,
and
several
files
of
dusty
papers
,
decorated
the
walls
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
sorry
to
leave
you
standing
at
the
door
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
girl
,
lighting
a
lamp
,
and
addressing
Mr
Pickwick
with
a
winning
smile
,
"
but
you
was
quite
strangers
to
me
;
and
we
have
such
a
many
trampers
that
only
come
to
see
what
they
can
lay
their
hands
on
,
that
really
---
"
   
"
There
is
not
the
least
occasion
for
any
apology
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
good
-
humouredly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
the
slightest
,
my
love
,
"
said
Bob
Sawyer
,
playfully
stretching
forth
his
arms
,
and
skipping
from
side
to
side
,
as
if
to
prevent
the
young
lady
's
leaving
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
The
young
lady
was
not
at
all
softened
by
these
allurements
,
for
she
at
once
expressed
her
opinion
,
that
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
was
an
"
odous
creetur
;
"
and
,
on
his
becoming
rather
more
pressing
in
his
attentions
,
imprinted
her
fair
fingers
upon
his
face
,
and
bounced
out
of
the
room
with
many
expressions
of
aversion
and
contempt
.
   
<EOS>
Deprived
of
the
young
lady
's
society
,
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
proceeded
to
divert
himself
by
peeping
into
the
desk
,
looking
into
all
the
table
drawers
,
feigning
to
pick
the
lock
of
the
iron
safe
,
turning
the
almanac
with
its
face
to
the
wall
,
trying
on
the
boots
of
Mr
Winkle
,
senior
,
over
his
own
,
and
making
several
other
humorous
experiments
upon
the
furniture
,
all
of
which
afforded
Mr
Pickwick
unspeakable
horror
and
agony
,
and
yielded
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
proportionate
delight
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
the
door
opened
,
and
a
little
old
gentleman
in
a
snuff
-
coloured
suit
,
with
a
head
and
face
the
precise
counterpart
of
those
belonging
to
Mr
Winkle
,
junior
,
excepting
that
he
was
rather
bald
,
trotted
into
the
room
with
Mr
Pickwick
's
card
in
one
hand
,
and
a
silver
candlestick
in
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pickwick
,
sir
,
how
do
you
do
?
"
said
Winkle
the
elder
,
putting
down
the
candlestick
and
proffering
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hope
<EOS>
I
see
you
well
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Glad
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
Be
seated
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
I
beg
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
This
gentleman
is
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
My
friend
,
Mr
Sawyer
,
"
interposed
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
your
son
's
friend
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
the
elder
,
looking
rather
grimly
at
Bob
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
are
well
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Right
as
a
trivet
,
sir
,
"
replied
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
other
gentleman
,
"
cried
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
is
,
as
you
will
see
when
you
have
read
the
letter
with
which
I
am
intrusted
,
a
very
near
relative
,
or
I
should
rather
say
a
very
particular
friend
of
your
son
's
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
is
Allen
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
THAT
gentleman
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Winkle
,
pointing
with
the
card
towards
Ben
Allen
,
who
had
fallen
asleep
in
an
attitude
which
left
nothing
of
him
visible
but
his
spine
and
his
coat
collar
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
was
on
the
point
of
replying
to
the
question
,
and
reciting
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
's
name
and
honourable
distinctions
at
full
length
,
when
the
sprightly
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
with
a
view
of
rousing
his
friend
to
a
sense
of
his
situation
,
inflicted
a
startling
pinch
upon
the
fleshly
part
of
his
arm
,
which
caused
him
to
jump
up
with
a
shriek
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
aware
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
a
stranger
<EOS>
,
Mr
Ben
Allen
advanced
and
,
shaking
Mr
Winkle
most
affectionately
by
both
hands
for
about
five
minutes
,
murmured
,
in
some
half
-
intelligible
fragments
of
sentences
,
the
great
delight
he
felt
in
seeing
him
,
and
a
hospitable
inquiry
whether
he
felt
disposed
to
take
anything
after
his
walk
,
or
would
prefer
waiting
"
till
dinner
-
time
;
"
which
done
,
he
sat
down
and
gazed
about
him
with
a
petrified
stare
,
as
if
he
had
not
the
remotest
idea
where
he
was
,
which
indeed
he
had
not
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
was
most
embarrassing
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
the
more
especially
as
Mr
Winkle
,
senior
,
evinced
palpable
astonishment
at
the
eccentric
---
not
to
say
extraordinary
---
behaviour
of
his
two
companions
.
 
<EOS>
To
bring
the
matter
to
an
issue
at
once
,
he
drew
a
letter
from
his
pocket
,
and
presenting
it
to
Mr
Winkle
,
senior
,
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
This
letter
,
Sir
,
is
from
your
son
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
see
,
by
its
contents
,
that
on
your
favourable
and
fatherly
consideration
of
it
,
depend
his
future
happiness
and
welfare
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
oblige
me
by
giving
it
the
calmest
and
coolest
perusal
,
and
by
discussing
the
subject
afterwards
with
me
,
in
the
tone
and
spirit
in
which
alone
it
ought
to
be
discussed
?
 
<EOS>
You
may
judge
of
the
importance
of
your
decision
to
your
son
,
and
his
intense
anxiety
upon
the
subject
,
by
my
waiting
upon
you
,
without
any
previous
warning
,
at
so
late
an
hour
;
<EOS>
and
,
"
added
Mr
Pickwick
,
glancing
slightly
at
his
two
companions
---
"
and
under
such
unfavourable
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
prelude
,
Mr
Pickwick
placed
four
closely
-
written
sides
of
extra
superfine
wire
-
wove
penitence
in
the
hands
of
the
astounded
Mr
Winkle
,
senior
.
 
<EOS>
Then
reseating
himself
in
his
chair
,
he
watched
his
looks
and
manner
:
anxiously
,
it
is
true
,
but
with
the
open
front
of
a
gentleman
who
feels
he
has
taken
no
part
which
he
need
excuse
or
palliate
.
<EOS>
The
old
wharfinger
turned
the
letter
over
,
looked
at
the
front
,
back
,
and
sides
,
made
a
microscopic
examination
of
the
fat
little
boy
on
the
seal
,
raised
his
eyes
to
Mr
Pickwick
's
face
,
and
then
,
seating
himself
on
the
high
stool
,
and
drawing
the
lamp
closer
to
him
,
broke
the
wax
,
unfolded
the
epistle
,
and
lifting
it
to
the
light
,
prepared
to
read
.
<EOS>
Just
at
this
moment
,
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
whose
wit
had
lain
dormant
for
some
minutes
,
placed
his
hands
on
his
knees
,
and
made
a
face
after
the
portraits
of
the
late
Mr
Grimaldi
,
as
clown
.
<EOS>
It
so
happened
that
Mr
Winkle
,
senior
,
instead
of
being
deeply
engaged
in
reading
the
letter
,
as
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
thought
,
chanced
to
be
looking
over
the
top
of
it
at
no
less
a
person
than
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
himself
;
rightly
conjecturing
that
the
face
aforesaid
was
made
in
ridicule
and
derision
of
his
own
person
,
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
Bob
with
such
expressive
sternness
,
that
the
late
Mr
Grimaldi
's
lineaments
gradually
resolved
themselves
into
a
very
fine
expression
of
humility
and
confusion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
speak
,
Sir
?
"
inquired
Mr
Winkle
,
senior
,
after
an
awful
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
replied
Bob
,
With
no
remains
of
the
clown
about
him
,
save
and
except
the
extreme
redness
of
his
cheeks
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
sure
you
did
not
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
senior
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
yes
,
sir
,
quite
,
"
replied
Bob
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
did
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
old
gentleman
,
with
indignant
emphasis
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
LOOKED
at
me
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
sir
,
not
at
all
,
"
replied
Bob
,
with
extreme
civility
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
senior
.
 
<EOS>
Having
frowned
upon
the
abashed
Bob
with
great
magnificence
,
the
old
gentleman
again
brought
the
letter
to
the
light
,
and
began
to
read
it
seriously
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
eyed
him
intently
as
he
turned
from
the
bottom
line
of
the
first
page
to
the
top
line
of
the
second
,
and
from
the
bottom
of
the
second
to
the
top
of
the
third
,
and
from
the
bottom
of
the
third
to
the
top
of
the
fourth
;
but
not
the
slightest
alteration
of
countenance
afforded
a
clue
to
the
feelings
with
which
he
received
the
announcement
of
his
son
's
marriage
,
which
Mr
Pickwick
knew
was
in
the
very
first
half
-
dozen
lines
.
   
<EOS>
He
read
the
letter
to
the
last
word
,
folded
it
again
with
all
the
carefulness
and
precision
of
a
man
of
business
,
and
,
just
when
Mr
Pickwick
expected
some
great
outbreak
of
feeling
,
dipped
a
pen
in
the
ink
-
stand
,
and
said
,
as
quietly
as
if
he
were
speaking
on
the
most
ordinary
counting
-
house
topic
---
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
Nathaniel
's
address
,
Mr
Pickwick
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
George
and
Vulture
,
at
present
,
"
replied
that
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
George
and
Vulture
.
 
<EOS>
Where
is
that
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
George
Yard
,
Lombard
Street
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
the
city
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
methodically
indorsed
the
address
on
the
back
of
the
letter
;
and
then
,
placing
it
in
the
desk
,
which
he
locked
,
said
,
as
he
got
off
the
stool
and
put
the
bunch
of
keys
in
his
pocket
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
there
is
nothing
else
which
need
detain
us
,
Mr
Pickwick
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
else
,
my
dear
Sir
!
"
observed
that
warm
-
hearted
person
in
indignant
amazement
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
else
!
 
<EOS>
Have
you
no
opinion
to
express
on
this
momentous
event
in
our
young
friend
's
life
?
 
<EOS>
No
assurance
to
convey
to
him
,
through
me
,
of
the
continuance
of
your
affection
and
protection
?
 
<EOS>
Nothing
to
say
which
will
cheer
and
sustain
him
,
and
the
anxious
girl
who
looks
to
him
for
comfort
and
support
?
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Sir
,
consider
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
consider
,
"
replied
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
say
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
man
of
business
,
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
commit
myself
hastily
in
any
affair
,
and
from
what
I
see
of
this
,
I
by
no
means
like
the
appearance
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
thousand
pounds
is
not
much
,
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
very
right
,
Sir
,
"
interposed
Ben
Allen
,
just
awake
enough
to
know
that
he
had
spent
his
thousand
pounds
without
the
smallest
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
an
intelligent
man
.
 
<EOS>
Bob
,
he
's
a
very
knowing
fellow
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
happy
to
find
that
you
do
me
the
justice
to
make
the
admission
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
,
senior
,
looking
contemptuously
at
Ben
Allen
,
who
was
shaking
his
head
profoundly
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
that
when
I
gave
my
son
a
roving
license
for
a
year
or
so
,
to
see
something
of
men
and
manners
(
which
he
has
done
under
your
auspices
)
,
so
that
he
might
not
enter
life
a
mere
boarding
-
school
milk
-
sop
to
be
gulled
by
everybody
,
I
never
bargained
for
this
.
 
<EOS>
He
knows
that
very
well
,
so
if
I
withdraw
my
countenance
from
him
on
this
account
,
he
has
no
call
to
be
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
He
shall
hear
from
me
,
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
night

Margaret

open
the
door

"
   
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
Bob
Sawyer
had
been
nudging
Mr
Ben
Allen
to
say
something
on
the
right
side
;
Ben
accordingly
now
burst
,
without
the
slightest
preliminary
notice
,
into
a
brief
but
impassioned
piece
of
eloquence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Ben
Allen
,
staring
at
the
old
gentleman
,
out
of
a
pair
of
very
dim
and
languid
eyes
,
and
working
his
right
arm
vehemently
up
and
down
,
"
you
---
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
the
lady
's
brother
,
of
course
you
are
an
excellent
judge
of
the
question
,
"
retorted
Mr
Winkle
,
senior
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
;
that
's
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
say
no
more
,
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
gentlemen
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
the
old
gentleman
took
up
the
candle
-
stick
and
opening
the
room
door
,
politely
motioned
towards
the
passage
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
regret
this
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
setting
his
teeth
close
together
to
keep
down
his
choler
;
for
he
felt
how
important
the
effect
might
prove
to
his
young
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
at
present
of
a
different
opinion
,
"
calmly
replied
Mr
Winkle
,
senior
.
 
<EOS>
"
Once
again
,
gentlemen
,
I
wish
you
a
good
-
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
walked
with
angry
strides
into
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
completely
quelled
by
the
decision
of
the
old
gentleman
's
manner
,
took
the
same
course
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Ben
Allen
's
hat
rolled
down
the
steps
immediately
afterwards
,
and
Mr
Ben
Allen
's
body
followed
it
directly
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
party
went
silent
and
supperless
to
bed
;
and
Mr
Pickwick
thought
,
just
before
he
fell
asleep
,
that
if
he
had
known
Mr
Winkle
,
senior
,
had
been
quite
so
much
of
a
man
of
business
,
it
was
extremely
probable
he
might
never
have
waited
upon
him
,
on
such
an
errand
.

<EOS>
In
which
Mr
Pickwick
encounters
an
old
acquaintance
---
to
which
fortunate
circumstance
the
reader
is
mainly
indebted
for
matter
of
thrilling
interest
herein
set
down
,
concerning
two
great
public
men
of
might
and
power
 
<EOS>
The
morning
which
broke
upon
Mr
Pickwick
's
sight
at
eight
o'clock
,
was
not
at
all
calculated
to
elevate
his
spirits
,
or
to
lessen
the
depression
which
the
unlooked
-
for
result
of
his
embassy
inspired
.
 
<EOS>
The
sky
was
dark
and
gloomy
,
the
air
was
damp
and
raw
,
the
streets
were
wet
and
sloppy
.
 
<EOS>
The
smoke
hung
sluggishly
above
the
chimney
-
tops
as
if
it
lacked
the
courage
to
rise
,
and
the
rain
came
slowly
and
doggedly
down
,
as
if
it
had
not
even
the
spirit
to
pour
.
 
<EOS>
A
game
-
cock
in
the
stableyard
,
deprived
of
every
spark
of
his
accustomed
animation
,
balanced
himself
dismally
on
one
leg
in
a
corner
;
a
donkey
,
moping
with
drooping
head
under
the
narrow
roof
of
an
outhouse
,
appeared
from
his
meditative
and
miserable
countenance
to
be
contemplating
suicide
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
street
,
umbrellas
were
the
only
things
to
be
seen
,
and
the
clicking
of
pattens
and
splashing
of
rain
-
drops
were
<EOS>
the
only
sounds
to
be
heard
.
   
<EOS>
The
breakfast
was
interrupted
by
very
little
conversation
;
even
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
felt
the
influence
of
the
weather
,
and
the
previous
day
's
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
own
expressive
language
he
was
"
floored
.
"
<EOS>
So
was
Mr
Ben
Allen
.
 
<EOS>
So
was
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
In
protracted
expectation
of
the
weather
clearing
up
,
the
last
evening
paper
from
London
was
read
and
re
-
read
with
an
intensity
of
interest
only
known
in
cases
of
extreme
destitution
;
every
inch
of
the
carpet
was
walked
over
with
similar
perseverance
;
the
windows
were
looked
out
of
,
often
enough
to
justify
the
imposition
of
an
additional
duty
upon
them
;
all
kinds
of
topics
of
conversation
were
started
,
and
failed
;
and
at
length
Mr
Pickwick
,
when
noon
had
arrived
,
without
a
change
for
the
better
,
rang
the
bell
resolutely
,
and
ordered
out
the
chaise
.
   
<EOS>
Although
the
roads
were
miry
,
and
the
drizzling
rain
came
down
harder
than
it
had
done
yet
,
and
although
the
mud
and
wet
splashed
in
at
the
open
windows
of
the
carriage
to
such
an
extent
that
the
discomfort
was
almost
as
great
to
the
pair
of
insides
as
to
the
pair
of
outsides
,
still
there
was
something
in
the
motion
,
and
the
sense
of
being
up
and
doing
,
which
was
so
infinitely
superior
to
being
pent
in
a
dull
room
,
looking
at
the
dull
rain
dripping
into
a
dull
street
,
that
they
all
agreed
,
on
starting
,
that
the
change
was
a
great
improvement
,
and
wondered
how
they
could
possibly
have
delayed
making
it
as
long
as
they
had
done
.
   
<EOS>
When
they
stopped
to
change
at
Coventry
,
the
steam
ascended
from
the
horses
in
such
clouds
as
wholly
to
obscure
the
hostler
,
whose
voice
was
however
heard
to
declare
from
the
mist
,
that
he
expected
the
first
gold
medal
from
the
Humane
Society
on
their
next
distribution
of
rewards
,
for
taking
the
postboy
's
hat
off
;
the
water
descending
from
the
brim
of
which
,
the
invisible
gentleman
declared
,
must
have
drowned
him
(
the
postboy
)
,
but
for
his
great
presence
of
mind
in
tearing
it
promptly
from
his
head
,
and
drying
the
gasping
man
's
countenance
with
a
wisp
of
straw
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
pleasant
,
"
said
Bob
Sawyer
,
turning
up
his
coat
collar
,
and
pulling
the
shawl
over
his
mouth
to
concentrate
the
fumes
of
a
glass
of
brandy
just
swallowed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
,
"
replied
Sam
composedly
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
seem
to
mind
it
,
"
observed
Bob
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Vy

I

replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
an
unanswerable
reason
,
anyhow
,
"
said
Bob
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wotever
is
,
is
right
,
as
the
young
nobleman
sweetly
remarked
wen
they
put
him
down
in

pension
list
<EOS>
"
cos

"
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bad
notion
that
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
approvingly
.
   
<EOS>
,
Just
wot
<EOS>
the
young
nobleman
said
ev'ry
quarter
-
day
arterwards
for
the
rest
of
his
life
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wos
you
ever
called
in
,
"
inquired
Sam
,
glancing
at
the
driver
,
after
a
short
silence
,
and
lowering
his
voice
to
a
mysterious
whisper
---
"
wos
you
ever
called
in

when

prentice
to

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
remember
that
I
ever
was

"
replied
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
never
see
a

WALKED

demanded
Sam

<EOS>

No

Bob

I

you

<EOS>
inquired
Sam
,
pursuing
his
catechism
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
rejoined
Bob
,
"
I
never

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No

"
rejoined
Sam
triumphantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
never
vill
;
and
there
's
another
thing
that
no

<EOS>
No

never

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
the
postboys
?
"
asked
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
here
,
"
replied
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Without
goin'
so
far
as
to
as
-
sert
,
as
some
wery
sensible
people
do
,
that
postboys
and
donkeys
is
both
immortal
,
wot
<EOS>
I
say
is
this
:
that
wenever
they
feels
theirselves
gettin
'
stiff
and
past
their
work
,
they
just
rides
off
together
,
wun
postboy
to
a
pair
in
the
usual
way
;
wot
becomes
on
'em
<EOS>
nobody
knows
,
but
it
's
wery
probable
as
they
starts
avay
to
take
their
pleasure
in
some
other
vorld
,
for
there
ai
n't
a
man
alive
as
ever
see
either
a
donkey
or
a
postboy
<EOS>
a
-
takin
'
his
pleasure
in
this
!
"
   
<EOS>
Expatiating
upon
this
learned
and
remarkable
theory
,
and
citing
many
curious
statistical
and
other
facts
in
its
support
,
Sam
Weller
beguiled
the
time
until
they
reached
Dunchurch
,
where
a
dry
postboy
and
fresh
horses
were
procured
;
the
next
stage
was
Daventry
,
and
the
next
Towcester
;
and
at
the
end
of
each
stage
it
rained
harder
than
it
had
done
at
the
beginning
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
remonstrated
Bob
Sawyer
,
looking
in
at
the
coach
window
,
as
they
pulled
up
before
the
door
of
the
Saracen
's
Head
,
Towcester
,
"
this
wo
n't
do
,
you
know
.
"
   
"
Bless
me
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
just
awakening
from
a
nap
,
"
I
'm
afraid
you
're
wet
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
are
,
are
you
?
"
returned
Bob
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
,
a
little
that
way
,
Uncomfortably
damp
,
perhaps
.
"
   
<EOS>
Bob
did
look
dampish
,
inasmuch
as
the
rain
was
streaming
from
his
neck
,
elbows
,
cuffs
,
skirts
,
and
knees
;
and
his
whole
apparel
shone
so
with
the
wet
,
that
it
might
have
been
mistaken
for
a
full
suit
of
prepared
oilskin
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
AM
rather
wet
,
"
said
Bob
,
giving
himself
a
shake
and
casting
a
little
hydraulic
shower
around
,
like
a
Newfoundland
dog
just
emerged
from
the
water
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
's
quite
impossible
to
go
on
to
-
night
,
"
interposed
Ben
.
   
<EOS>
"
Out
of
the
question
,
sir
,
"
remarked
Sam
Weller
,
coming
to
assist
in
the
conference
;
"
it
's
a
cruelty
to
animals
,
sir
,
to
ask
'em
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
beds
here
,
sir
,
"
said
Sam
,
addressing
his
master
,
"
everything
clean
and
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
Wery
good
little
dinner
,
sir
,
they
can
get
ready
in
half
an
hour

of
fowls

and
a

French

"
taturs

tart
,
and
tidiness

<EOS>
You

you

I
might
recommend

<EOS>
Take

the
doctor
said

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
host
of
the
Saracen
's
Head
opportunely
appeared
at
this
moment
,
to
confirm
Mr
Weller
's
statement
relative
to
the
accommodations
of
the
establishment
,
and
to
back
his
entreaties
with
a
variety
of
dismal
conjectures
regarding
the
state
of
the
roads
,
the
doubt
of
fresh
horses
being
to
be
had
at
the
next
stage
,
the
dead
certainty
of
its
raining
all
night
,
the
equally
mortal
certainty
of
its
clearing
up
in
the
morning
,
and
other
topics
of
inducement
familiar
to
innkeepers
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
but
I
must
send
a
letter
to
London
by
some
conveyance
,
so
that
it
may
be
delivered
the
very
first
thing
in
the
morning
,
or
I
must
go
forwards
at
all
hazards
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
landlord
smiled
his
delight
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
easier
than
for
the
gentleman
to
inclose
a
letter
in
a
sheet
of
brown
paper
,
and
send
it
on
,
either
by
the
mail
or
the
night
coach
from
Birmingham
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
gentleman
were
particularly
anxious
to
have
it
left
as
soon
as
possible
,
he
might
write
outside
,
"
To
be
delivered
immediately
,
"
which
was
sure
to
be
attended
to
;
or
"
Pay
the
bearer
half
-
a
-
crown
extra
for
instant
delivery
,
"
which
was
surer
still
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
then
we
will
stop
here
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Lights

Sun

up

cried
the
landlord
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
way
,
gentlemen
;
do
n't
trouble
yourselves
about
the
postboy
now

<EOS>
I

for

<EOS>
Now
,
John
,
the
candles

"
   
<EOS>
The
candles
were
brought
,
the
fire
was
stirred
up
,
and
a
fresh
log
of
wood
thrown
on
.
 
<EOS>
In
ten
minutes
"
time
,
a
waiter
was
laying
the
cloth
for
dinner
,
the
curtains
were
drawn
,
the
fire
was
blazing
brightly
,
and
everything
looked
(
as
everything
always
does
,
in
all
decent
English
inns
)
as
if
the
travellers
had
been
expected
,
and
their
comforts
prepared
,
for
days
beforehand
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
sat
down
at
a
side
table
,
and
hastily
indited
a
note
to
Mr
Winkle
,
merely
informing
him
that
he
was
detained
by
stress
of
weather
,
but
would
certainly
be
in
London
next
day
;
until
when
he
deferred
any
account
of
his
proceedings
.
 
<EOS>
This
note
was
hastily
made
into
a
parcel
,
and
despatched
to
the
bar
per
Mr
Samuel
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
left
it
with
the
landlady
,
and
was
returning
to
pull
his
master
's
boots
off
,
after
drying
himself
by
the
kitchen
fire
,
when
glancing
casually
through
a
half
-
opened
door
,
he
was
arrested
by
the
sight
of
a
gentleman
with
a
sandy
head
who
had
a
large
bundle
of
newspapers
lying
on
the
table
before
him
,
and
was
perusing
the
leading
article
of
one
with
a
settled
sneer
which
curled
up
his
nose
and
all
other
features
into
a
majestic
expression
of
haughty
contempt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
!
<EOS>
"
said
Sam
,
"
I
ought
to
know
that
'
ere
head

features

brimmed

<EOS>
Eatansvill

"
   
<EOS>
Sam
was
taken
with
a
troublesome
cough
,
at
once
,
for
the
purpose
of
attracting
the
gentleman
's
attention
;
the
gentleman
starting
at
the
sound
,
raised
his
head
and
his
eyeglass
,
and
disclosed
to
view
the
profound
and
thoughtful
features
of
Mr
Pott
,
of
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
.
   
<EOS>
"
Beggin
'
your
pardon

"
said
Sam
,
advancing
with
a
bow
,
"
my
master
's
here
,
Mr
Pott
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
hush
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Pott
,
drawing
Sam
into
the
room
,
and
closing
the
door
,
with
a
countenance
of
mysterious
dread
and
apprehension
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
's
the
matter
,
Sir
?
"
inquired
Sam
,
looking
vacantly
about
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
whisper
of
my
name
,
"
replied
Pott
;
"
this
is
a
buff
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
excited
and
irritable
populace
knew
I
was
here
,
I
should
be
torn
to
pieces

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No

<EOS>
Vould
you

inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
the
victim
of
their
fury
,
"
replied
Pott
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
young
man
,
what
of
your
master
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
-
stopping
here
to
-
night
on
his
vay
to
town
,
with
a
couple
of
friends
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr
Winkle
one
of
them
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Pott
,
with
a
slight
frown
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Vinkle
stops
at
home
now
,
"
rejoined
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
married
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Married
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Pott
,
with
frightful
vehemence
.
 
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
smiled
darkly
,
and
added
,
in
a
low
,
vindictive
tone
,
"
It
serves
him
right
!
"
<EOS>
Having
given
vent
to
this
cruel
ebullition
of
deadly
malice
and
cold
-
blooded
triumph
over
a
fallen
enemy
,
Mr
Pott
inquired
whether
Mr
Pickwick
's
friends
were
"
blue
?
"
 
<EOS>
Receiving
a
most
satisfactory
answer
in
the
affirmative
from
Sam
,
who
knew
as
much
about
the
matter
as
Pott
himself
,
he
consented
to
accompany
him
to
Mr
Pickwick
's
room
,
where
a
hearty
welcome
awaited
him
,
and
an
agreement
to
club
their
dinners
together
was
at
once
made
and
ratified
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
are
matters
going
on
in
Eatanswill
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
,
when
Pott
had
taken
a
seat
near
the
fire
,
and
<EOS>
the
whole
party
had
got
their
wet
boots
off
,
and
dry
slippers
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
the
INDEPENDENT
still
in
being
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
INDEPENDENT
,
sir
,
"
replied
Pott
,
"
is
still
dragging
on
a
wretched
and
lingering
career

<EOS>
Abhorred
and
despised
by
even
the
few
who
are
cognisant
of
its
miserable
and
disgraceful
existence
,
stifled
by
the
very
filth
<EOS>
it
so
profusely
scatters
,
rendered
deaf
and
blind
by
the
exhalations
of
its
own
slime
<EOS>
,
the
obscene
journal
,
happily
unconscious
of
its
degraded
state
,
is
rapidly
sinking
beneath
that
treacherous
mud
which
,
while
it
seems
to
give
it
a
firm
standing
with
the
low
and
debased
classes
of
society
,
is
nevertheless
rising
above
its
detested
head
,
and
will
speedily
engulf
it
for
ever
.
"
   
<EOS>
Having
delivered
this
manifesto
(
which
formed
a
portion
of
his
last
week
's
leader
)
with
vehement
articulation
,
the
editor
paused
to
take
breath
,
and
looked
majestically
at
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
young
man
,
sir
,
"
said
Pott
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
nodded
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
are
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Pott
,
addressing
Mr
Ben
Allen
.
   
<EOS>
Ben
admitted
the
soft
impeachment
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
are
both
deeply
imbued
with
those
blue
principles
,
which
,
so
long
as
I
live
,
I
have
pledged
myself
to
the
people
of
these
kingdoms
to
support
and
to
maintain
?
"
suggested
Pott
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
do
n't
exactly
know
about
that
,
"
replied
Bob
Sawyer
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
---
"
   
"
Not
buff
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
interrupted
Pott
,
drawing
back
his
chair
,
"
your
friend
is
not
buff
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
rejoined
Bob
,
"
<EOS>
I
'm
a
kind
of
plaid
at
present
;
a
compound
of
all
sorts
of
colours
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
waverer
,
"
said
Pott
solemnly
,
"
a
waverer
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
show
you
a
series
of
eight
articles
<EOS>
,
Sir
,
that
have
appeared
in
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
may
venture
to
say
that
you
would
not
be
long
in
establishing
your
opinions
on
a
firm
and
solid
blue
basis
,
sir
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
I
should
turn
very
blue
,
long
before
I
got
to
the
end
of
them
,
"
responded
Bob
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pott
looked
dubiously
at
Bob
Sawyer
for
some
seconds
,
and
,
turning
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
the
literary
articles
which
have
appeared
at
intervals
in
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
in
the
course
of
the
last
three
months
,
and
which
have
excited
such
general
---
I
may
say
such
universal
---
attention
and
admiration
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
slightly
embarrassed
by
the
question
,
"
the
fact
is
,
I
have
been
so
much
engaged
in
other
ways
,
that
I
really
have
not
had
an
opportunity
of
perusing
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
should
do
so
,
Sir
,
"
said
Pott
,
with
a
severe
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
appeared
in
the
form
of
a
copious
review
of
a
work
on
Chinese
metaphysics
,
Sir
,
"
said
Pott
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
observed
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
from
your
pen
,
I
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
From
the
pen
of
my
critic
,
Sir
,
"
rejoined
Pott
,
with
dignity
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
abstruse
subject
,
I
should
conceive
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
,
Sir
,
"
responded
Pott
,
looking
intensely
sage
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
CRAMMED
for
it
,
to
use
a
technical
but
expressive
term
;
he
read
up
for
the
subject
,
at
my
desire
,
in
the
"
Encyclopaedia
Britannica
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
   
"
Indeed
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
I
was
not
aware
that
that
valuable
work
contained
any
information
respecting
Chinese
metaphysics
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
read
,
Sir
,
"
rejoined
Pott
,
laying
his
hand
on
Mr
Pickwick
's
knee
,
and
looking
round
with
a
smile
of
intellectual
superiority
 
<EOS>
---
"
he
read
for
metaphysics
under
the
letter
M
,
and
for
China
under
the
letter
C
,
and
combined
his
information
,
Sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pott
's
features
assumed
so
much
additional
grandeur
at
the
recollection
of
the
power
and
research
displayed
in
the
learned
effusions
in
question
,
that
some
minutes
elapsed
before
Mr
Pickwick
felt
emboldened
to
renew
the
conversation
;
at
length
,
as
the
editor
's
countenance
gradually
relaxed
into
its
customary
expression
of
moral
supremacy
,
he
ventured
to
resume
the
discourse
by
asking
---
   
"
<EOS>
Is
it
fair
to
inquire
<EOS>
what
great
object
has
brought
you
so
far
from
home
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
object
which
actuates
and
animates
me
in
all
my
gigantic
labours
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Pott
,
with
a
calm
smile
:
"
my
country
's
good
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
supposed
it
was
some
public
mission
,
"
observed
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Sir
,
"
resumed
Pott
,
"
it
is
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
,
bending
towards
Mr
Pickwick
,
he
whispered
in
a
deep
,
hollow
voice
,
"
A
Buff
ball
,
Sir
,
will
take
place
in
Birmingham
to
-
morrow
evening
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
me
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Sir
,
and
supper
,
"
added
Pott
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
say
so
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
Pott
nodded
portentously
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
although
Mr
Pickwick
feigned
to
stand
aghast
at
this
disclosure
,
he
was
so
little
versed
in
local
politics
that
he
was
unable
to
form
an
adequate
comprehension
of
the
importance
of
the
dire
conspiracy
it
referred
to
;
observing
which
,
Mr
Pott
,
drawing
forth
the
last
number
of
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
,
and
referring
to
the
same
,
delivered
himself
of
the
following
paragraph
:
---
          
HOLE
-
AND
-
CORNER
BUFFERY
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
reptile
contemporary
has
recently
sweltered
forth
his
black
venom
in
the
vain
and
hopeless
attempt
of
sullying
the
fair
name
of
our
distinguished
and
excellent
representative
,
the
Honourable
Mr
Slumkey
---
that
Slumkey
whom
we
,
long
before
he
gained
his
present
noble
and
exalted
position
,
predicted
would
one
day
be
,
as
he
now
is
,
at
once
his
country
's
brightest
honour
,
and
her
proudest
boast
:
alike
her
bold
defender
and
her
honest
pride
---
our
reptile
contemporary
,
we
say
,
has
made
himself
merry
,
at
the
expense
of
a
superbly
embossed
plated
coal
-
scuttle
,
which
has
been
presented
to
that
glorious
man
by
his
enraptured
constituents
,
and
towards
the
purchase
of
which
,
the
nameless
wretch
insinuates
,
the
Honourable
Mr
Slumkey
himself
contributed
,
through
a
confidential
friend
of
his
butler
's
,
more
than
three
-
fourths
of
the
whole
sum
subscribed
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
does
not
the
crawling
creature
see
,
that
even
if
this
be
the
fact
,
the
Honourable
Mr
Slumkey
only
appears
in
a
still
more
amiable
and
radiant
light
than
before
,
if
that
be
possible
?
 
<EOS>
Does
not
even
his
obtuseness
perceive
that
this
amiable
and
touching
desire
to
carry
out
the
wishes
of
the
constituent
body
,
must
for
ever
endear
him
to
the
hearts
and
souls
of
such
of
his
fellow
townsmen
as
are
not
worse
than
swine
;
or
,
in
other
words
,
who
are
not
as
debased
as
our
contemporary
himself
?
 
<EOS>
But
such
is
the
wretched
trickery
of
hole
-
and
-
corner
Buffery
!
 
<EOS>
These
are
not
its
only
artifices
.
 
<EOS>
Treason
is
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
We
boldly
state
,
now
that
we
are
goaded
to
the
disclosure
,
and
we
throw
ourselves
on
the
country
and
its
constables
for
protection
<EOS>
---
we
boldly
state
that
secret
preparations
are
at
this
moment
in
progress
for
a
Buff
ball
;
which
is
to
be
held
in
a
Buff
town
,
in
the
very
heart
and
centre
of
a
Buff
population
;
which
is
to
be
conducted
by
a
Buff
master
of
the
ceremonies
;
which
is
to
be
attended
by
four
ultra
Buff
members
of
Parliament
,
and
the
admission
to
which
,
is
to
be
by
Buff
tickets
!
 
<EOS>
Does
our
fiendish
contemporary
wince
?
 
<EOS>
Let
him
writhe
,
in
impotent
malice
,
as
we
pen
the
words
,
WE
WILL
BE
THERE
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
Sir
,
"
said
Pott
,
folding
up
the
paper
quite
exhausted
,
"
that
is
the
state
of
the
case
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
landlord
and
waiter
entering
at
the
moment
with
dinner
,
caused
Mr
Pott
to
lay
his
finger
on
his
lips
,
in
token
that
he
considered
his
life
in
Mr
Pickwick
's
hands
,
and
depended
on
his
secrecy
.
 
<EOS>
Messrs.
Bob
Sawyer
and
Benjamin
Allen
,
who
had
irreverently
fallen
asleep
during
the
reading
of
the
quotation
from
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
,
and
the
discussion
which
followed
it
,
were
roused
by
the
mere
whispering
of
the
talismanic
word
"
Dinner
"
in
their
ears
;
and
to
dinner
they
went
with
good
digestion
waiting
on
appetite
,
and
health
on
both
,
and
a
waiter
on
all
three
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
dinner
and
the
sitting
which
succeeded
it
,
Mr
Pott
descending
,
for
a
few
moments
,
to
domestic
topics
,
informed
Mr
Pickwick
that
the
air
of
Eatanswill
not
agreeing
with
his
lady
,
she
was
then
engaged
in
making
a
tour
of
different
fashionable
watering
-
places
with
a
view
to
the
recovery
of
her
wonted
health
and
spirits
;
this
was
a
delicate
veiling
of
the
fact
that
Mrs
Pott
,
acting
upon
her
often
-
repeated
threat
of
separation
,
had
,
in
virtue
of
an
arrangement
negotiated
by
her
brother
,
the
lieutenant
,
and
concluded
by
Mr
Pott
,
permanently
retired
with
the
faithful
bodyguard
upon
one
moiety
or
half
part
of
the
annual
income
and
profits
arising
from
the
editorship
and
sale
of
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
.
   
<EOS>
While
the
great
Mr
Pott
was
dwelling
upon
this
and
other
matters
,
enlivening
the
conversation
from
time
to
time
with
various
extracts
from
his
own
lucubrations
,
a
stern
stranger
,
calling
from
the
window
of
a
stage
-
coach
,
outward
bound
,
which
halted
at
the
inn
to
deliver
packages
,
requested
to
know
whether
if
he
stopped
short
on
his
journey
and
remained
there
for
the
night
,
he
could
be
furnished
with
the
necessary
accommodation
of
a
bed
and
bedstead
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
landlord
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
can
I
?
"
inquired
the
stranger
,
who
seemed
habitually
suspicious
in
look
and
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
of
it
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
landlord
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
,
"
said
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Coachman
,
I
get
down
here
.
<EOS>
Guard
,
my
carpet
-
bag
!
"
   
<EOS>
Bidding
the
other
passengers
good
-
night
,
in
a
rather
snappish
manner
,
the
stranger
alighted
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
shortish
gentleman
,
with
very
stiff
black
hair
cut
in
the
porcupine
or
blacking
-
brush
style
,
and
standing
stiff
and
straight
all
over
his
head
;
his
aspect
was
pompous
and
threatening
;
his
manner
was
peremptory
;
his
eyes
were
sharp
and
restless
;
and
his
whole
bearing
bespoke
a
feeling
of
great
confidence
in
himself
,
and
a
consciousness
of
immeasurable
superiority
over
all
other
people
.
   
<EOS>
This
gentleman
was
shown
into
the
room
originally
assigned
to
the
patriotic
Mr
Pott
;
and
the
waiter
remarked
,
in
dumb
astonishment
at
the
singular
coincidence
,
that
he
had
no
sooner
lighted
the
candles
than
the
gentleman
,
diving
into
his
hat
,
drew
forth
a
newspaper
,
and
began
to
read
it
with
the
very
same
expression
of
indignant
scorn
,
which
,
upon
the
majestic
features
of
Pott
,
had
paralysed
his
energies
an
hour
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
observed
too
,
that
,
whereas
Mr
Pott
's
scorn
had
been
roused
by
a
newspaper
headed
the
Eatanswill
INDEPENDENT
,
this
gentleman
's
withering
contempt
was
awakened
by
a
newspaper
entitled
the
Eatanswill
GAZETTE
.
   
<EOS>
"
Send
the
landlord
,
"
said
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
the
waiter
.
   
<EOS>
The
landlord
was
sent
,
and
came
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
the
landlord
?
"
inquired
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sir
,
"
replied
the
landlord
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Slurk
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
The
landlord
slightly
inclined
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Slurk
,
sir
,
"
repeated
the
gentleman
haughtily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
me
now
,
man
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
landlord
scratched
his
head
,
looked
at
the
ceiling
,
and
at
the
stranger
,
and
smiled
feebly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
me
,
man
?
"
inquired
the
stranger
angrily
.
   
<EOS>
The
landlord
made
a
strong
effort
,
and
at
length
replied
,
   
"
Well
,
Sir
,
I
do
not
know
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Great
Heaven
!
"
said
the
stranger
,
dashing
his
clenched
fist
upon
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
this
is
popularity
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
landlord
took
a
step
or
two
towards
the
door
;
the
stranger
fixing
his
eyes
upon
him
,
resumed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
,
"
said
the
stranger
---
"
this
is
gratitude
for
years
of
labour
and
study
in
behalf
of
the
masses
.
 
<EOS>
I
alight
wet
and
weary
;
no
enthusiastic
crowds
press
forward
to
greet
their
champion
<EOS>
;
the
church
bells
are
silent
;
the
very
name
elicits
no
responsive
feeling
in
their
torpid
bosoms
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
enough
,
"
said
the
agitated
Mr
Slurk
,
pacing
to
and
fro
,
"
to
curdle
the
ink
in
one
's
pen
,
and
induce
one
to
abandon
their
cause
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
say
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
landlord
,
venturing
a
hint
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rum
,
"
said
Mr
Slurk
,
turning
fiercely
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
got
a
fire
anywhere
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
can
light
one
directly
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
landlord
.
   
<EOS>
"
Which
will
throw
out
no
heat
until
it
is
bed
-
time
,
"
interrupted
Mr
Slurk
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anybody
in
the
kitchen
?
"
   
<EOS>
Not
a
soul
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
beautiful
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
had
gone
,
and
the
house
door
was
closed
for
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
drink
my
rum
-
and
-
water
,
"
said
Mr
Slurk
,
"
by
the
kitchen
fire
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
,
gathering
up
his
hat
and
newspaper
,
he
stalked
solemnly
behind
the
landlord
to
that
humble
apartment
,
and
throwing
himself
on
a
settle
by
the
fireside
,
resumed
his
countenance
of
scorn
,
and
began
to
read
and
drink
in
silent
dignity
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
some
demon
of
discord
,
flying
over
the
Saracen
's
Head
at
that
moment
,
on
casting
down
his
eyes
in
mere
idle
curiosity
,
happened
to
behold
Slurk
established
comfortably
by
the
kitchen
fire
,
and
Pott
slightly
elevated
with
wine
in
another
room
;
upon
which
the
malicious
demon
,
darting
down
into
the
last
-
mentioned
apartment
with
inconceivable
rapidity
,
passed
at
once
into
the
head
of
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
and
prompted
him
for
his
(
the
demon
's
)
own
evil
purpose
to
speak
as
follows
:
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
we
've
let
the
fire
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
uncommonly
cold
after
the
rain
,
is
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
really
is
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
shivering
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
n't
be
a
bad
notion
to
have
a
cigar
by
the
kitchen
fire
,
would
it
?
"
said
Bob
Sawyer
,
still
prompted
by
the
demon
aforesaid
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
particularly
comfortable
,
I
think
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pott
,
what
do
you
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pott
yielded
a
ready
assent
;
and
all
four
travellers
,
each
with
his
glass
in
his
hand
,
at
once
betook
themselves
to
the
kitchen
,
with
Sam
Weller
heading
the
procession
to
show
them
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
The
stranger
was
still
reading
;
he
looked
up
and
started
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pott
started
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
whispered
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
reptile
!
"
replied
Pott
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
reptile
?
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
about
him
for
fear
he
should
tread
on
some
overgrown
black
beetle
,
or
dropsical
spider
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
reptile
,
"
whispered
Pott
,
catching
Mr
Pickwick
by
the
arm
,
and
pointing
towards
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
reptile
Slurk
,
of
the
INDEPENDENT
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
we
had
better
retire
,
"
whispered
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
,
Sir
,
"
rejoined
Pott
,
pot
-
valiant
in
a
double
sense
---
"
never
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
Mr
Pott
took
up
his
position
on
an
opposite
settle
,
and
selecting
one
from
a
little
bundle
of
newspapers
,
began
to
read
against
his
enemy
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pott
,
of
course
read
the
INDEPENDENT
,
and
Mr
Slurk
,
of
course
,
read
the
GAZETTE
;
and
each
gentleman
audibly
expressed
his
contempt
at
the
other
's
compositions
by
bitter
laughs
and
sarcastic
sniffs
;
whence
they
proceeded
to
more
open
expressions
of
opinion
,
such
as
"
absurd
,
"
"
wretched
,
"
"
atrocity
,
"
"
humbug
,
"
"
knavery
,
"
"
dirt
,
"
"
filth
,
"
"
slime
,
"
"
ditch
-
water
,
"
and
other
critical
remarks
of
the
like
nature
.
   
<EOS>
Both
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
and
Mr
Ben
Allen
had
beheld
these
symptoms
of
rivalry
and
hatred
,
with
a
degree
of
delight
which
imparted
great
additional
relish
to
the
cigars
at
which
they
were
puffing
most
vigorously
.
 
<EOS>
The
moment
they
began
to
flag
,
the
mischievous
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
addressing
Slurk
with
great
politeness
,
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
allow
me
to
look
at
your
paper
,
Sir
,
when
you
have
quite
done
with
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
very
little
to
repay
you
for
your
trouble
in
this
contemptible
THING
,
sir
,
"
replied
Slurk
,
bestowing
a
Satanic
frown
on
Pott
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
this
presently
,
"
said
Pott
,
looking
up
,
pale
with
rage
,
and
quivering
in
his
speech
,
from
the
same
cause
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
you
will
be
amused
with
this
FELLOW
'S
audacity
.
"
   
<EOS>
Terrible
emphasis
was
laid
upon
"
thing
"
and
"
fellow
"
;
and
the
faces
of
both
editors
began
to
glow
with
defiance
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
ribaldry
of
this
miserable
man
is
despicably
disgusting
,
"
said
Pott
,
pretending
to
address
Bob
Sawyer
,
and
scowling
upon
Slurk
.
<EOS>
Here
,
Mr
Slurk
laughed
very
heartily
,
and
folding
up
the
paper
so
as
to
get
at
a
fresh
column
conveniently
,
said
,
that
the
blockhead
really
amused
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
an
impudent
blunderer
this
fellow
is
,
"
said
Pott
,
turning
from
pink
to
crimson
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
read
any
of
this
man
's
foolery
,
Sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Slurk
of
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
replied
Bob
;
"
is
it
very
bad
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
shocking
!
<EOS>
shocking
!
<EOS>
"
rejoined
Slurk
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Really
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
me
,
this
is
too
atrocious
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Pott
,
at
this
juncture
;
still
feigning
to
be
absorbed
in
his
reading
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
can
wade
through
a
few
sentences
of
malice
,
meanness
,
falsehood
,
perjury
,
treachery
,
and
ca
nt
,
"
said
Slurk
,
handing
the
paper
to
Bob
<EOS>
,
"
you
will
,
perhaps
,
be
somewhat
repaid
by
a
laugh
at
the
style
of
this
ungrammatical
twaddler
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
you
said
,
Sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pott
,
looking
up
,
trembling
all
over
with
passion
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
to
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
replied
Slurk
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ungrammatical
twaddler
,
was
it
,
sir
?
"
said
Pott
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
it
was
,
"
replied
Slurk
;
"
and
BLUE
BORE
,
Sir
,
if
you
like
that
better
;
ha

ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pott
retorted
not
a
word
at
this
jocose
insult
,
but
deliberately
folded
up
his
copy
of
the
INDEPENDENT
,
flattened
it
carefully
down
,
crushed
it
beneath
his
boot
,
spat
upon
it
with
great
ceremony
,
and
flung
it
into
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
sir
,
"
said
Pott
,
retreating
from
the
stove
,
"
and
that
's
the
way
I
would
serve
the
viper
who
produces
it

if
I
were
not

fortunately
for
him

restrained
by
the

my

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Serve

<EOS>
cried
Slurk
,
starting
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
Those
laws
shall
never
be
appealed
to
by
him

in

Serve

<EOS>
"
Hear

said
Bob
Sawyer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing

fairer

observed
Mr
Ben
Allen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Serve
him
so
,
sir

"
<EOS>
reiterated
Slurk
,
in
a
loud
voice
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pott
darted
a
look
of
contempt
,
which
might
have
withered
an
anchor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Serve
him
so
,
sir

"
<EOS>
reiterated
Slurk
,
in
a
louder
voice
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not

"
rejoined
Pott
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

you
wo
n't
,
wo
n't
you

"
said
Mr
Slurk
,
in
a
taunting
manner
;
"

<EOS>
He
wo

oh

<EOS>
he
WON'T.
 
<EOS>
Ha

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
consider
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pott
,
moved
by
this
sarcasm
,
"
I
consider
you
a
viper
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
upon
you
,
sir
,
as
a
man
who
has
placed
himself
beyond
the
pale
of
society
,
by
his
most
audacious
,
disgraceful
,
and
abominable
public
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
I
view
you
,
sir
,
personally
and
politically
,
in
no
other
light
than
as
a
most
unparalleled
and
unmitigated
viper
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
indignant
Independent
did
not
wait
to
hear
the
end
of
this
personal
denunciation
;
for
,
catching
up
his
carpet
-
bag
,
which
was
well
stuffed
with
movables
,
he
swung
it
in
the
air
as
Pott
turned
away
,
and
,
letting
it
fall
with
a
circular
sweep
on
his
head
,
just
at
that
particular
angle
of
the
bag
where
a
good
thick
hairbrush
happened
to
be
packed
,
caused
a
sharp
crash
to
be
heard
throughout
the
kitchen
,
and
brought
him
at
once
to
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
cried
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
Pott
started
up
and
seized
the
fire
-
shovel
---
"
gentlemen
!
 
<EOS>
Consider
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
---
help
 
---
<EOS>
Sam
---
here
---
pray
,
gentlemen
---
interfere
,
somebody

"
   
<EOS>
Uttering
these
incoherent
exclamations
,
Mr
Pickwick
rushed
between
the
infuriated
combatants
just
in
time
to
receive
the
carpet
-
bag
on
one
side
of
his
body
,
and
the
fire
-
shovel
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
the
representatives
of
the
public
feeling
of
Eatanswill
were
blinded
by
animosity
,
or
(
being
both
acute
reasoners
)
saw
the
advantage
of
having
a
third
party
between
them
to
bear
all
the
blows
,
<EOS>
certain
it
is
that
they
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
but
defying
each
other
with
great
spirit
,
plied
the
carpet
-
bag
and
the
fire
-
shovel
most
fearlessly
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
would
unquestionably
have
suffered
severely
for
his
humane
interference
,
if
Mr
Weller
,
attracted
by
his
master
's
cries
,
had
not
rushed
in
at
the
moment
,
and
,
snatching
up
a
meal
---
sack
,
effectually
stopped
the
conflict
by
drawing
it
over
the
head
and
shoulders
of
the
mighty
Pott
,
and
clasping
him
tight
round
the
shoulders
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
away
that
'
ere
bag
from
the
t'other
madman
,
"
said
Sam
to
Ben
Allen
and
Bob
Sawyer
,
who
had
done
nothing
but
dodge
<EOS>
round
the
group
,
each
with
a
tortoise
-
shell
lancet
in
his
hand
,
ready
to
bleed
the
first
man
stunned
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
it
up
,
you
wretched
little
creetur
,
or
I
'll
smother
you
in
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Awed
by
these
threats
,
and
quite
out
of
breath
,
the
INDEPENDENT
suffered
himself
to
be
disarmed
;
and
Mr
Weller
,
removing
the
extinguisher
from
Pott
,
set
him
free
with
a
caution
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
take
yourselves
off
to
bed
quietly
,
"
said
Sam
,
"
or
I
'll
put
you
both
in
it
,
and
let
you
fight
it
out
vith
the
mouth
tied
,
as
I
vould
a
dozen
sich
,
if
they
played
these
games

<EOS>
And
you
have
the
goodness
to
come
this
here
way
,
sir
,
if
you
please

"
   
<EOS>
Thus
addressing
his
master
,
Sam
took
him
by
the
arm
,
and
led
him
off
,
while
the
rival
editors
were
severally
removed
to
their
beds
by
the
landlord
,
under
the
inspection
of
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
and
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
;
breathing
,
as
they
went
away
,
many
sanguinary
threats
,
and
making
vague
appointments
for
mortal
combat
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
came
to
think
it
over
,
however
,
it
occurred
to
them
that
they
could
do
it
much
better
in
print
,
so
they
recommenced
deadly
hostilities
without
delay
;
and
all
Eatanswill
rung
with
their
boldness
---
on
paper
.
   
<EOS>
They
had
taken
themselves
off
in
separate
coaches
,
early
next
morning
,
before
the
other
travellers
were
stirring
;
and
the
weather
having
now
cleared
up
,
the
chaise
companions
once
more
turned
their
faces
to
London

Chapter

<EOS>
Involving
a
serious
change
in
the
Weller
family
,
and
the
untimely
downfall
of
Mr
Stiggins
 
<EOS>
Considering
it
a
matter
of
delicacy
to
abstain
from
introducing
either
Bob
Sawyer
or
Ben
Allen
to
the
young
couple
,
until
they
were
fully
prepared
to
expect
them
,
and
wishing
to
spare
Arabella
's
feelings
as
much
as
possible
,
Mr
Pickwick
proposed
that
he
and
Sam
should
alight
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
George
and
Vulture
,
and
that
the
two
young
men
should
for
the
present
take
up
their
quarters
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
they
very
readily
agreed
,
and
the
proposition
was
accordingly
acted
upon
;
Mr
Ben
Allen
and
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
betaking
themselves
to
a
sequestered
pot
-
shop
on
the
remotest
confines
of
the
Borough
,
behind
the
bar
door
of
which
their
names
had
in
other
days
very
often
appeared
at
the
head
of
long
and
complex
calculations
worked
in
white
chalk
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
the
pretty
housemaid
,
meeting
Sam
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
ME
I
vish
it
vos
,
my

"
replied
Sam
,
dropping
behind
,
to
let
his
master
get
out
of
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wot

<EOS>
"

Mary

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh

Why

replied
the
pretty
housemaid
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lor

"
 
<EOS>
Thus
admonishing
him
,
the
pretty
housemaid
pushed
Sam
against
the
wall
,
declaring
that
he
had
tumbled
her
cap
,
and
put
her
hair
quite
out
of
curl
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
prevented

I
was
going
to
say

added
Mary

<EOS>
"
There

"
   
<EOS>
"
Vere
is
it
,
my
love
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
took
care
of
it
,
for
you
,
or
I
dare
say
it
would
have
been
lost
long
before
this
,
"
replied
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
,
take
it
;
it
's
more
than
you
deserve
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
after
many
pretty
little
coquettish
doubts
and
fears
,
and
wishes
that
she
might
not
have
lost
it
,
Mary
produced
the
letter
from
behind
the
nicest
little
muslin
tucker
possible
,
and
handed
it
to
Sam
,
who
thereupon
kissed
it
with
much
gallantry
and
devotion
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
goodness
me
!
"
said
Mary
,
adjusting
the
tucker
,
and
feigning
unconsciousness
,
"
you
seem
to
have
grown
very
fond
of
it
all
at
once
.
"
   
<EOS>
To
this
Mr
Weller
only
replied
by
a
wink
,
the
intense
meaning
of
which
no
description
could
convey
the
faintest
idea
of
;
and
,
sitting
himself
down
beside
Mary
on
a
window
-
seat
,
opened
the
letter
and
glanced
at
the
contents
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
!
"
exclaimed
Sam
,
"
wot
's
all
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
the
matter
<EOS>
,
I
hope
?
"
said
Mary
,
peeping
over
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
them
eyes
o
'
yourn
!
"
said
Sam
,
looking
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
my
eyes
;
you
had
much
better
read
your
letter
,
"
said
the
pretty
housemaid
;
and
as
she
said
so
,
she
made
the
eyes
twinkle
with
such
slyness
and
beauty
that
they
were
perfectly
irresistible
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
refreshed
himself
with
a
kiss
,
and
read
as

Wot

said
Sam
;
"
who
's

<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
got
somebody
to
write
it
for
him
,
and
signed
it
himself
afterwards
,
"
said
the
pretty
housemaid
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
minit
,
"
replied
Sam
,
running
over
the
letter
again
,
and
pausing
here
and
there
,
to
reflect
,
as
he
did
so
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
hit
it

<EOS>
The

then
my

comes
a

lookin

over

complicates

the

thing
he

<EOS>
You
're
right
,
Mary
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
Having
satisfied
himself
on
this
point
,
Sam
read
the
letter
all
over
,
once
more
,
and
,
appearing
to
form
a
clear
notion
of
its
contents
for
the
first
time
,
ejaculated
thoughtfully
,
as
he
folded
it
up
---
   
"
<EOS>
And
so
the
poor
creetur
's
dead
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry

<EOS>
She
warn't
<EOS>
a

disposed

ooman
,
if
them
shepherds
had
let
her
alone
.
<EOS>
I
'm
wery
sorry
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
uttered
these
words
in
so
serious
a
manner
,
that
the
pretty
housemaid
cast
down
her
eyes
and
looked
very
grave
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hows'ever
,
"
said
Sam
,
putting
the
letter
in
his
pocket
with
a
gentle
sigh
,
"
it
wos
to
be
---
and
wos
,
as
the
old
lady
said
arter
she
'd
married
the

<EOS>
Ca
n't
be
helped
now
,
can
it
,
Mary
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mary
shook
her
head
,
and
sighed
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
apply
to
the
hemperor
for
leave
of
absence
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
Mary
sighed
again
---
<EOS>
the
letter
was
so
very
affecting
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
!
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
"
rejoined
the
pretty
housemaid
,
turning
her
head
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
shake
hands
,
wo
n't
you
?
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
The
pretty
housemaid
put
out
a
hand
which
,
although
it
was
a
housemaid
's
,
was
a
very
small
one
,
and
rose
to
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
sha
n't
be
wery
long
avay
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
always
away
,
"
said
Mary
,
giving
her
head
the
slightest
possible
toss
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
no
sooner
come
,
Mr
Weller
,
than
you
go
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
drew
the
household
beauty
closer
to
him
,
and
entered
upon
a
whispering
conversation
,
which
had
not
proceeded
far
,
when
she
turned
her
face
round
and
condescended
to
look
at
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
parted
,
it
was
somehow
or
other
indispensably
necessary
for
her
to
go
to
her
room
,
and
arrange
the
cap
and
curls
before
she
could
think
of
presenting
herself
to
her
mistress
;
which
preparatory
ceremony
she
went
off
to
perform
,
bestowing
many
nods
and
smiles
on
Sam
over
the
banisters
as
she
tripped
upstairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
sha
n't
be
avay
more
than
a
day
,
or
two
,
<EOS>
Sir
,
at
the
furthest
,
"
said
Sam
,
when
he
had
communicated
to
Mr
Pickwick
the
intelligence
of
his
father
's
loss
.
   
<EOS>
"
As
long
as
may
be
necessary
,
Sam
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
you
have
my
full
permission
to
remain
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sam
bowed
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
tell
your
father
,
Sam
,
that
if
I
can
be
of
any
assistance
to
him
in
his
present
situation
,
I
shall
be
most
willing
and
ready
to
lend
him
any
aid
in
my
power
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
mention
it
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
And
with
some
expressions
of
mutual
good
-
will
and
interest
,
master
and
man
separated
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
just
seven
o'clock
when
Samuel
Weller
,
alighting
from
the
box
of
a
stage
-
coach
which
passed
through
Dorking
,
stood
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
Marquis
of
Granby
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
cold
,
dull
evening
;
the
little
street
looked
dreary
and
dismal
;
and
the
mahogany
countenance
of
the
noble
and
gallant
marquis
seemed
to
wear
a
more
sad
and
melancholy
expression
than
it
was
wo
nt
to
do
,
as
it
swung
to
and
fro
,
creaking
mournfully
in
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
The
blinds
were
pulled
down
,
and
the
shutters
partly
closed
;
of
the
knot
of
loungers
that
usually
collected
about
the
door
,
not
one
was
to
be
seen
;
the
place
was
silent
and
desolate
.
   
<EOS>
Seeing
nobody
of
whom
he
could
ask
any
preliminary
questions
,
Sam
walked
softly
in
,
and
glancing
round
,
he
quickly
recognised
his
parent
in
the
distance
.
   
<EOS>
The
widower
was
seated
at
a
small
round
table
in
the
little
room
behind
the
bar
,
smoking
a
pipe
,
with
his
eyes
intently
fixed
upon
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
The
funeral
had
evidently
taken
place
that
day
,
for
attached
to
his
hat
,
which
he
still
retained
on
his
head
,
was
a
hatband
measuring
about
a
yard
and
a
half
in
length
,
which
hung
over
the
top
rail
of
the
chair
and
streamed
negligently
down
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
was
in
a
very
abstracted
and
contemplative
mood
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
that
Sam
called
him
by
name
several
times
<EOS>
,
he
still
continued
to
smoke
with
the
same
fixed
and
quiet
countenance
,
and
was
only
roused
ultimately
by
his
son
's
placing
the
palm
of
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sammy
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
"
you
're
welcome
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
a
-
callin
'
to
you
half
a
dozen
times
,
"
said
Sam
,
hanging
his
hat
on
a
peg
,
"
but
you
did
n't
hear
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sammy
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
,
again
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
in
a
referee
,
Sammy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
about
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
,
drawing
his
chair
up
to
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
a
referee
,
Sammy
,
"
replied
the
elder
Mr
Weller
,
"
regarding
HER
,
Samivel
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Weller
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
Dorking
churchyard
,
in
mute
explanation
that
his
words
referred
to
the
late
Mrs
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wos
a
-
thinkin
'
,
Sammy
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
eyeing
his
son
,
with
great
earnestness
,
over
his
pipe
,
as
if
to
assure
him
that
however
extraordinary
and
incredible
<EOS>
the
declaration
might
appear
,
it
was
nevertheless
calmly
and
deliberately
uttered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wos
a
-
thinkin
'
,
Sammy
,
that
upon
the
whole
I
wos
wery
sorry
she
wos
gone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
and
so
you
ought
to
be
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
nodded
his
acquiescence
in
the
sentiment
,
and
again
fastening
his
eyes
on
the
fire
,
shrouded
himself
in
a
cloud
,
and
mused
deeply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Those
wos
wery
sensible
observations
as
she
made
,
Sammy
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
driving
the
smoke
away
with
his
hand
,
after
a
long
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
observations
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Them
as
she
made
,
arter
she
was
took
ill
,
"
replied
the
old
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
Wot
was
they
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Somethin'
to
this
here
effect

<EOS>
"
Veller
,

she
says
,
"
I

<EOS>
I
begin

she
says
,
"
ven
it
's
too
late

that
if

she
says
,
"
and
I
've
vasted

She
smiled
at
this

Samivel

said
the
old
gentleman
,
stifling
a
sigh
with
his
pipe
,
"

Vell

said
Sam
,
venturing
to
offer
a
little
homely
consolation
,
after
the
lapse
of
three
or
four
minutes
,
consumed
by
the
old
gentleman
in
slowly
shaking
his
head
from
side

solemnly
smoking

So

said
Mr
Weller
the
elder
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
Providence
in
it
all
,
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
O
'
course
there
is
,
"
replied
his
father
,
with
a
nod
of
grave
approval
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wot

undertakers
vithout

Sammy

"
   
<EOS>
Lost
in
the
immense
field
of
conjecture
opened
by
this
reflection
,
the
elder
Mr
Weller
laid
his
pipe
on
the
table
,
and
stirred
the
fire
with
a
meditative
visage
.
   
<EOS>
While
the
old
gentleman
was
thus
engaged
,
a
very
buxom
-
looking
cook
,
dressed
in
mourning
,
who
had
been
bustling
about
,
in
the
bar
,
glided
into
the
room
,
and
bestowing
many
smirks
of
recognition
upon
Sam
,
silently
stationed
herself
at
the
back
of
his
father
's
chair
,
and
announced
her
presence
by
a
slight
cough
,
the
which
,
being
disregarded
,
was
followed
by
a
louder
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
elder
Mr
Weller
,
dropping
the
poker
as
he
looked
round
,
and
hastily
drew
his
chair
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wot
's
the
matter
now
?
"
   
"
Have
a
cup
of
tea
<EOS>
,
there
's
a
good
soul
,
"
replied
the
buxom
female
coaxingly
.
<EOS>
"
I
von't
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
,
in
a
somewhat
boisterous
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
see
you
---
"
Mr
Weller
hastily
checked
himself
,
and
added
in
a
low
tone
,
"
furder
fust
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
,
dear
!
 
<EOS>
How
adwersity
does
change
people
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
lady
,
looking
upwards
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
only
thing
'
twixt
this
and
the
doctor
as
shall
change
my
condition
,
"
muttered
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
really
never
saw
a
man
so
cross
,
"
said
the
buxom
female
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
for
my
own
good
;
vich
is
the
reflection
vith
vich

penitent
school

boy
comforted
his
feelin
's
ven
<EOS>
they
flogged
him
,
"
rejoined
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
The
buxom
female
shook
her
head
with
a
compassionate
and
sympathising
air
;
and
,
appealing
to
Sam
,
inquired
whether
his
father
really
ought
not
to
make
an
effort
to
keep
up
,
and
not
give
way
to
that
lowness
of
spirits
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Mr
Samuel
,
"
said
the
buxom
female
,
"
<EOS>
as
I
was
telling
him
yesterday
,
he
will
feel
lonely
,
he
ca
n't
expect
but
what
he
should
,
sir
,
but
he
should
keep
up
a
good
heart
,
because
,
dear
me
,
I
'm
sure
we
all
pity
his
loss
,
and
are
ready
to
do
anything
for
him
;
and
there
's
no
situation
in
life
so
bad
,
Mr
Samuel
,
that
it
ca
n't
be
mended
.
 
<EOS>
Which
is
what
a
very
worthy
person
said
to
me
when
my
husband
died
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
the
speaker
,
putting
her
hand
before
her
mouth
,
coughed
again
,
and
looked
affectionately
at
the
elder
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
As
I
do
n't
rekvire
any
o
'
your
conversation
just
now

,
vill
you
have
the
goodness
to
re

tire

"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Weller
,
in
a
grave
and
steady
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
the
buxom
female
,
"
I
'm
sure
I
only
spoke
to
you
out
of
kindness

"
Wery

Mr

<EOS>
"
Samivel

the

and
shut
the
door
after
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
hint
was
not
lost
upon
the
buxom
female
;
for
she
at
once
left
the
room
,
and
slammed
the
door
behind
her
,
upon
which
Mr
Weller
,
senior
,
falling
back
in
his
chair
in
a
violent
perspiration
,
said
---
   
<EOS>

<EOS>
"

smiling
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do

take
no

replied
Mr

,
poking
the
fire
vehemently
,
"

"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
paused
with
an
aspect
of
intense
disgust
,
and
looking
round
,
added
in
a
whisper
,
"
They

"
   
<EOS>
Sam
gave
a
comical
look
in
reply
,
and
the
old
gentleman
having
broken
an
obstinate
lump
of
coal
,
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
as
much
earnestness
and
malice
as
if
it
had
been
the
head
of
one
of
the
widows
last
-
mentioned
,
said
:
   
"

<EOS>
"
How
are
you
safer

"
interrupted
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cos

replied
Mr
Weller
,
looking
fixedly
at
his
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
'Cos

<EOS>
"
If

Mr

rather
disparagingly

Mr

;
"

correcting

<EOS>
"
Wery

Samivel

returned
Mr

<EOS>
With
these
words
,
Mr
Weller
refilled
and
relighted
his
pipe
,
and
once
more
summoning
up
a
meditative
expression
of
countenance
,
continued
as
follows

Mr

Sam

<EOS>
"
The

continued
the
elder
Mr

;
"

"
   
<EOS>
Having
delivered
this
warning
,
Mr
Weller
resumed
his
pipe
with
a
more
serene
countenance
;
the
disclosure
of
these
matters
appearing
to
have
eased
his
mind
considerably
.
   
<EOS>
"
Somebody
's
a
-
tappin
'
at

door

"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
'em
tap
,
"
replied
his
father
,
with
dignity
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
acted
upon
the
direction
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
another
tap
,
and
another
,
and
then
a
long
row
of
taps
;
upon
which
Sam
inquired
why
the
tapper
was
not
admitted
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
"
whispered
Mr
Weller
,
with
apprehensive
looks
,
"
do

take
no
notice

Sammy
<EOS>
,

<EOS>

"
   
<EOS>
No
notice
being
taken
of
the
taps
,
the
unseen
visitor
,
after
a
short
lapse
,
ventured
to
open
the
door
and
peep
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
no
female
head
that
was
thrust
in
at
the
partially
-
opened
door
,
but
the
long
black
locks
and
red
face
of
Mr
Stiggins
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
's
pipe
fell
from
his
hands
.
   
<EOS>
The
reverend
gentleman
gradually
opened
the
door
by
almost
imperceptible
degrees
,
until
the
aperture
was
just
wide
enough
to
admit
of
the
passage
of
his
lank
body
,
when
he
glided
into
the
room
and
closed
it
after
him
,
with
great
care
and
gentleness
.
<EOS>
Turning
towards
Sam
,
and
raising
his
hands
and
eyes
in
token
of
the
unspeakable
sorrow
with
which
he
regarded
the
calamity
that
had
befallen
the
family
,
he
carried
the
high
-
backed
chair
to
his
old
corner
by
the
fire
,
and
,
seating
himself
on
the
very
edge
,
drew
forth
a
brown
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
and
applied
the
same
to
his
optics
.
   
<EOS>
While
this
was
going
forward
,
the
elder
Mr
Weller
sat
back
in
his
chair
,
with
his
eyes
wide
open
,
his
hands
planted
on
his
knees
,
and
his
whole
countenance
expressive
of
absorbing
and
overwhelming
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
sat
opposite
him
in
perfect
silence
,
waiting
,
with
eager
curiosity
,
for
the
termination
of
the
scene
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Stiggins
kept
the
brown
pocket
-
handkerchief
before
his
eyes
for
some
minutes
,
moaning
decently
meanwhile
,
and
then
,
mastering
his
feelings
by
a
strong
effort
,
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
buttoned
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
After
this
,
he
stirred
the
fire
;
after
that
,
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
looked
at
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
young
friend
,
"
said
Mr
Stiggins
,
breaking
the
silence
,
in
a
very
low
voice
,
"
here
's
a
sorrowful
affliction
!
"
   
<EOS>
Sam
nodded
very
slightly
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
the
man
of
wrath
,
too
!
"
added
Mr
Stiggins
;
"
it
makes
a
vessel
's
heart
bleed
!
"
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
was
overheard
by
his
son
to
murmur
something
relative
to
making
a
vessel
's
nose
bleed
;
but
Mr
Stiggins
heard
him
not
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
young
man
,
"
whispered
Mr
Stiggins
,
drawing
his
chair
closer
to
Sam
,
"
whether
she
has
left
Emanuel
anything
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
he
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
chapel
,
"
replied
Mr
Stiggins
;
"
our
chapel
;
our
fold
,
Mr
Samuel
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
has
n't
left
the
fold
nothin'
,
nor
the
shepherd
nothin'
,
nor
the
animals
nothin'
,
"
said
Sam
decisively
;
"
nor
the
dogs
neither
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Stiggins
looked
slily
at
Sam
;
glanced
at
the
old
gentleman
,
who
was
sitting
with
his
eyes
closed
,
as
if
asleep
;
and
drawing
his
chair
still
nearer
,
said
---
   
"
Nothing
for
ME
,
Mr
Samuel
?
"
   
<EOS>
Sam
shook
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
's
something
,
"
said
Stiggins
,
turning
as
pale
as
he
could
turn
.
 
<EOS>
"
Consider
,
Mr
Samuel
;
no
little
token
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
so
much
as
<EOS>
the
vorth
o
'
that
'
ere
old
umberella
o
'
yourn
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
said
Mr
Stiggins
hesitatingly
,
after
a
few
moments
"
deep
thought
,
"
<EOS>
perhaps
she
recommended
me
to
the
care
of
the
man
of
wrath
,
Mr
Samuel
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
's
wery
likely
,
from
what
he
said
,
"
rejoined
Sam
;
"
he
wos
a
-
speakin
'
about
you
,
jist
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Was
he
,
though
?
"
exclaimed
Stiggins
,
brightening
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
He
's
changed
,
I
dare
say
.
 
<EOS>
We
might
live
very
comfortably
together
now
,
Mr
Samuel
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
take
care
of
his
property
when
you
are
away
---
<EOS>
good
care
<EOS>
,
you
see
.
"
   
<EOS>
Heaving
a
long
-
drawn
sigh
,
Mr
Stiggins
paused
for
a
response
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
nodded
,
and
Mr
Weller
the
elder
gave
vent
to
an
extraordinary
sound
,
which
,
being
neither
a
groan
,
nor
a
grunt
,
nor
a
gasp
,
nor
a
growl
,
seemed
to
partake
in
some
degree
of
the
character
of
all
four
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Stiggins
,
encouraged
by
this
sound
,
which
he
understood
to
betoken
remorse
or
repentance
,
looked
about
him
,
rubbed
his
hands
,
wept
,
smiled
,
wept
again
,
and
then
,
walking
softly
across
the
room
to
a
well
-
remembered
shelf
in
one
corner
,
took
down
a
tumbler
,
and
with
great
deliberation
put
four
lumps
of
sugar
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Having
got
thus
far
,
he
looked
about
him
again
,
and
sighed
grievously
;
with
that
,
he
walked
softly
into
the
bar
,
and
presently
returning
with
the
tumbler
half
full
of
pine
-
apple
rum
,
advanced
to
the
kettle
which
was
singing
gaily
on
the
hob
,
mixed
his
grog
,
stirred
it
,
sipped
it
,
sat
down
,
and
taking
a
long
and
hearty
pull
at
the
rum
-
and
-
water
,
stopped
for
breath
.
   
<EOS>
The
elder
Mr
Weller
,
who
still
continued
to
make
various
strange
and
uncouth
attempts
to
appear
asleep
,
offered
not
a
single
word
during
these
proceedings
;
but
when
Stiggins
stopped
for
breath
,
he
darted
upon
him
,
and
snatching
the
tumbler
from
his
hand
,
threw
the
remainder
of
the
rum
-
and
-
water
in
his
face
,
and
the
glass
itself
into
the
grate
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
seizing
the
reverend
gentleman
firmly
by
the
collar
,
he
suddenly
fell
to
kicking
him
most
furiously
,
accompanying
every
application
of
his
top
-
boot
to
Mr
Stiggins
's
person
,
with
sundry
violent
and
incoherent
anathemas
upon
his
limbs
,
eyes
,
and
body
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sammy
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
"
put
my
hat
on
tight
for
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sam
dutifully
adjusted
the
hat
with
the
long
hatband
more
firmly
on
his
father
's
head
,
and
the
old
gentleman
,
resuming
his
kicking
with
greater
agility
than
before
,
tumbled
with
Mr
Stiggins
through
the
bar
,
and
through
the
passage
,
out
at
the
front
door
,
and
so
into
the
street
---
the
kicking
continuing
the
whole
way
,
and
increasing
in
vehemence
,
rather
than
diminishing
,
every
time
the
top
-
boot
was
lifted
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
beautiful
and
exhilarating
sight
to
see
the
red
-
nosed
man
writhing
in
Mr
Weller
's
grasp
,
and
his
whole
frame
quivering
with
anguish
as
kick
followed
kick
in
rapid
succession
;
it
was
a
still
more
exciting
spectacle
to
behold
Mr
Weller
,
after
a
powerful
struggle
,
immersing
Mr
Stiggins
's
head
in
a
horse
-
trough
full
of
water
,
and
holding
it
there
,
until
he
was
half
suffocated
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
throwing
all
his
energy
into
one
most
complicated
kick
,
as
he
at
length
permitted
Mr
Stiggins
to
withdraw
his
head
from
the
trough
,
"
send
any
vun
o
'
<EOS>
them
lazy
shepherds
here
,
and
<EOS>
I
'll
pound
him
to
a

<EOS>
Sammy
,
help
me
in
,
and
fill
me
a
small
glass
of
brandy

<EOS>
Comprising
the
final
exit
of
Mr
Jingle
and
job
trotter
,
with
a
great
morning
of
business
in
Gray
's
Inn
Square
---
concluding
with
a
double
knock
at
Mr
Perker
's
door
 
<EOS>
When
Arabella
,
after
some
gentle
preparation
and
many
assurances
that
there
was
not
the
least
occasion
for
being
low
-
spirited
,
was
at
length
made
acquainted
by
Mr
Pickwick
with
the
unsatisfactory
result
of
his
visit
to
Birmingham
,
she
burst
into
tears
,
and
sobbing
aloud
,
lamented
in
moving
terms
that
she
should
have
been
the
unhappy
cause
of
any
estrangement
between
a
father
and
his
son
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
girl
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
kindly
,
"
it
is
no
fault
of
yours
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
foresee
that
the
old
gentleman
would
be
so
strongly
prepossessed
against
his
son
's
marriage
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
"
added
Mr
Pickwick
,
glancing
at
her
pretty
face
,
"
he
can
have
very
little
idea
of
the
pleasure
he
denies
himself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
said
Arabella
,
"
what
shall
we
do
,
if
he
continues
to
be
angry
with
us
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
wait
patiently
,
my
dear
,
until
he
thinks
better
of
it
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
cheerfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
dear
Mr
Pickwick
,
what
is
to
become
of
Nathaniel
if
his
father
withdraws
his
assistance
?
"
urged
Arabella
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
,
my
love
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
I
will
venture
to
prophesy
that
he
will
find
some
other
friend
who
will
not
be
backward
in
helping
him
to
start
in
the
world
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
significance
of
this
reply
was
not
so
well
disguised
by
Mr
Pickwick
but
that
Arabella
understood
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
throwing
her
arms
round
his
neck
,
and
kissing
him
affectionately
<EOS>
,
she
sobbed
louder
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
taking
her
hand
,
"
we
will
wait
here
a
few
days
longer
,
and
see
whether
he
writes
or
takes
any
other
notice
of
your
husband
's
communication
.
 
<EOS>
If
not
,
I
have
thought
of
half
a
dozen
plans
,
any
one
of
which
would
make
you
happy
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
my
dear
,
there
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
Mr
Pickwick
gently
pressed
Arabella
's
hand
,
and
bade
her
dry
<EOS>
her
eyes
,
and
not
distress
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
Arabella
,
who
was
one
of
the
best
little
creatures
alive
,
put
her
handkerchief
in
her
reticule
,
and
by
the
time
Mr
Winkle
joined
them
,
exhibited
in
full
lustre
the
same
beaming
smiles
and
sparkling
eyes
that
had
originally
captivated
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
distressing
predicament
for
these
young
people
,
"
thought
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
he
dressed
himself
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
walk
up
to
Perker
's
,
and
consult
him
about
the
matter
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Pickwick
was
further
prompted
to
betake
himself
to
Gray
's
Inn
Square
by
an
anxious
desire
to
come
to
a
pecuniary
settlement
with
the
kind
-
hearted
little
attorney
without
further
delay
,
he
made
a
hurried
breakfast
,
and
executed
his
intention
so
speedily
,
that
ten
o'clock
had
not
struck
when
he
reached
Gray
's
Inn
.
   
<EOS>
It
still
wanted
ten
minutes
to
the
hour
when
he
had
ascended
the
staircase
on
which
Perker
's
chambers
were
.
 
<EOS>
The
clerks
had
not
arrived
yet
,
and
he
beguiled
the
time
by
looking
out
of
the
staircase
window
.
<EOS>
The
healthy
light
of
a
fine
October
morning
made
even
the
dingy
old
houses
brighten
up
a
little
;
some
of
the
dusty
windows
actually
looking
almost
cheerful
as
the
sun
's
rays
gleamed
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
Clerk
after
clerk
hastened
into
the
square
by
one
or
other
of
the
entrances
,
and
looking
up
at
the
Hall
clock
,
accelerated
or
decreased
his
rate
of
walking
according
to
the
time
at
which
his
office
hours
nominally
commenced
;
the
half
-
past
nine
o'clock
people
suddenly
becoming
very
brisk
,
and
the
ten
o'clock
gentlemen
falling
into
a
pace
of
most
aristocratic
slowness
.
<EOS>
The
clock
struck
ten
,
and
clerks
poured
in
faster
than
ever
,
each
one
in
a
greater
perspiration
than
his
predecessor
.
 
<EOS>
The
noise
of
unlocking
and
opening
doors
echoed
and
re
-
echoed
on
every
side
;
heads
appeared
as
if
by
magic
in
every
window
;
the
porters
took
up
their
stations
for
the
day
;
the
slipshod
laundresses
hurried
off
;
the
postman
ran
from
house
to
house
;
and
the
whole
legal
hive
was
in
a
bustle
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
early
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
said
a
voice
behind
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Mr
Lowten
,
"
replied
that
gentleman
,
looking
round
,
and
recognising
his
old
acquaintance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Precious
warm
walking
,
is
n't
it
?
"
said
Lowten
,
drawing
a
Bramah
key
from
his
pocket
,
with
a
small
plug
therein
,
to
keep
the
dust
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
appear
to
feel
it
so
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Pickwick
,
smiling
at
the
clerk
,
who
was
literally
red
-
hot
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
come
along
,
rather
,
I
can
tell
you
,
"
replied
Lowten
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
went
the
half
hour
as
I
came
through
the
Polygon
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
here
before
him
,
though
,
so
I
do
n't
mind
.
"
   
<EOS>
Comforting
himself
with
this
reflection
,
Mr
Lowten
extracted
the
plug
from
the
door
-
key
;
having
opened
the
door
,
replugged
and
repocketed
his
Bramah
,
and
picked
up
the
letters
which
the
postman
had
dropped
through
the
box
,
he
ushered
Mr
Pickwick
into
the
office
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
he
divested
himself
of
his
coat
,
put
on
a
threadbare
garment
,
which
he
took
out
of
a
desk
,
hung
up
his
hat
,
pulled
forth
a
few
sheets
of
cartridge
and
blotting
-
paper
in
alternate
layers
,
and
,
sticking
a
pen
behind
his
ear
,
rubbed
his
hands
with
an
air
of
great
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
you
see
,
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
he
said
,
"
now
I
'm
complete
.
<EOS>
I
've
got
my
office
coat
on
,
and
my
pad
out
,
and
let
him
come
as
soon
as
he
likes
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
n't
got
a
pinch
of
snuff
about
you
,
have
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
have
not
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
for
it
,
"
said
Lowten
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
run
out
presently
,
and
get
a
bottle
of
soda
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
I
look
rather
queer
about
the
eyes
,
Mr
Pickwick
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
individual
appealed
to
,
surveyed
Mr
Lowten
's
eyes
from
a
distance
,
and
expressed
his
opinion
that
no
unusual
queerness
was
perceptible
in
those
features
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
of
it
,
"
said
Lowten
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
were
keeping
it
up
pretty
tolerably
at
the
Stump
last
night
,
and
I
'm
rather
out
of
sorts
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Perker
's
been
about
that
business
of
yours
,
by
the
bye
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
business
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Bardell
's
costs
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
n't
mean
that
,
"
replied
Mr
Lowten
.
 
<EOS>
"
About
getting
that
customer
that
we
paid
the
ten
shillings
in
the
pound
to
the
bill
-
discounter
for

on
your
account
---
to
get
him
out

you

about

to
Demerara

"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr
Jingle
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Well
?
"
   
"
Well
,
it
's
all
arranged
,
"
said
Lowten
,
mending
his
pen
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
agent
at
Liverpool
said
he
had
been
obliged
to
you
many
times
when
you
were
in
business
,
and
he
would
be
glad
to
take
him
on
your
recommendation
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
delighted
to
hear
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
say
,
"
resumed
Lowten
,
scraping
the
back
of
the
pen
preparatory
to
making
a
fresh
split
,
"
what
a
soft
chap
that
other
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Which
other
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
that
servant
,
or
friend
,
or
whatever
he
is
;
you

Trotter

<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
always
thought
him
the
reverse
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
so
did
I
,
from
what
little
I
saw
of
him
,
"
replied
Lowten
,
"
it
only
shows
how
one
may
be
deceived
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
his
going
to
Demerara
,
too
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
And
giving
up
what
was
offered
him
here
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Treating
Perker
's
offer
of
eighteen
bob
a
week
,
and
a
rise
if
he
behaved
himself
,
like
dirt
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Lowten
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
said
he
must
go
along
with
the
other
one
,
and
so
they
persuaded
Perker
to
write
again
,
and
they
've
got
him
something
on
the
same
estate
;
not
near
so
good
,
Perker
says
,
as
a
convict
would
get
in
New
South
Wales
,
if
he
appeared
at
his
trial
in
a
new
suit
of
clothes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Foolish
fellow
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
glistening
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
Foolish
fellow
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
worse
than
foolish
;
it
's
downright
sneaking
,
you
know
,
"
replied
Lowten
,
nibbing
the
pen
with
a
contemptuous
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
says
that
he
's
the
only
friend
he
ever
had
,
and
he
's
attached
to
him
,
and
all
that
.
 
<EOS>
Friendship
's
a
very
good
thing
in
its
way
<EOS>
---
we
are
all
very
friendly
and
comfortable
at
the
Stump
,
for
instance
,
over
our
grog
,
where
every
man
pays
for
himself
;
but
damn
hurting
yourself
for
anybody
else
,
you
know
!
 
<EOS>
No
man
should
have
more
than
two
attachments
---
the
first
,
to
number
one
,
and
the
second
to
the
ladies
;
that
's
what
I
say
---
ha
!
ha
!
"
<EOS>
Mr
Lowten
concluded
with
a
loud
laugh
,
half
in
jocularity
,
and
half
in
derision
,
which
was
prematurely
cut
short
by
the
sound
of
Perker
's
footsteps
on
the
stairs
,
at
the
first
approach
of
which
,
he
vaulted
on
his
stool
with
an
agility
most
remarkable
,
and
wrote
intensely
.
   
<EOS>
The
greeting
between
Mr
Pickwick
and
his
professional
adviser
was
warm
and
cordial
;
the
client
was
scarcely
ensconced
in
the
attorney
's
arm
-
chair
,
however
,
when
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
,
and
a
voice
inquired
whether
Mr
Perker
was
within
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
<EOS>
"
said
Perker
,
"
that
's
one
of
our
vagabond
friends
---
Jingle
himself
,
my
dear
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
see
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
,
hesitating
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
think
you
had
better
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
you
Sir
,
what
's
your
name
,
walk
in
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
In
compliance
with
this
unceremonious
invitation
,
Jingle
and
Job
walked
into
the
room
,
but
,
seeing
Mr
Pickwick
,
stopped
short
in
some
confusion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
Perker
,
"
do
n't
you
know
that
gentleman
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
reason
to
,
"
replied
Mr
Jingle
,
stepping
forward
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pickwick
---
deepest
obligations
---
life
preserver
---
made
a
man
of
me
---
you
shall
never
repent
it
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
happy
to
hear
you
say
so
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
look
much
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thanks

you

sir

<EOS>
great
change

<EOS>
Majesty
's
Fleet
---
unwholesome
place

very
,
"
said
Jingle
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
decently
and
cleanly
dressed
,
and
so
was
Job
,
who
stood
bolt
upright
behind
him
,
staring
at
Mr
Pickwick
with
a
visage
of
iron
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
do
they
go
to
Liverpool
?
"
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
,
half
aside
to
Perker
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
evening
,
Sir
,
at
seven
o'clock
,
"
said
Job
,
taking
one
step
forward
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
the
heavy
coach
from
the
city
,
Sir
.
"
   
"
Are
your
places
taken
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
are
,
sir
,
"
replied
Job
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
fully
made
up
your
mind
to
go
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
sir
,
"
answered
Job
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
regard
to
such
an
outfit
as
was
indispensable
for
Jingle
,
"
said
Perker
,
addressing
Mr
Pickwick
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
taken
upon
myself
to
make
an
arrangement
for
the
deduction
of
a
small
sum
from
his
quarterly
salary
,
which
,
being
made
only
for
one
year
,
and
regularly
remitted
,
will
provide
for
that
expense
.
 
<EOS>
I
entirely
disapprove
of
your
doing
anything
for
him
,
<EOS>
my
dear
sir
,
which
is
not
dependent
on
his
own
exertions
and
good
conduct
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
interposed
Jingle
,
with
great
firmness
.
 
<EOS>
"
Clear
head
 
---
man
of
the
world
---
quite
right
---
perfectly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
compounding
with
his
creditor
,
releasing
his
clothes
from
the
pawnbroker
's
,
relieving
him
in
prison
,
and
paying
for
his
passage
,
"
continued
Perker
,
without
noticing
Jingle
's
observation
,
"
you
have
already
lost
upwards
of
fifty
pounds
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
lost
,
"
said
Jingle
hastily
,
"
Pay
it
all
<EOS>
---
stick
to
business

cash
up
---
every
farthing

<EOS>
Yellow
fever
,
perhaps
---
ca
n't
help
that
 
---
if
not
---
"
Here
Mr
Jingle
paused
,
and
striking
the
crown
of
his
hat
with
great
violence
,
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
,
and
sat
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
means
to
say
,
"
said
Job
,
advancing
a
few
paces
,
"
that
if
he
is
not
carried
off
by
the
fever
,
he
will
pay
the
money
back
again
.
<EOS>
If
he
lives
,
he
will
,
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
see
it
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
he
will
,
Sir
,
"
said
Job
,
with
energy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
undertake
to
swear
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
had
been
bestowing
a
score
or
two
of
frowns
upon
Perker
,
to
stop
his
summary
of
benefits
conferred
,
which
the
little
attorney
obstinately
disregarded
,
"
you
must
be
careful
not
to
play
any
more
desperate
cricket
matches
,
Mr
Jingle
,
or
to
renew
your
acquaintance
with
Sir
Thomas
Blazo
,
and
I
have
little
doubt
of
your
preserving
your
health
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jingle
smiled
at
this
sally
,
but
looked
rather
foolish
notwithstanding
;
so
Mr
Pickwick
changed
the
subject
by
saying
---
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
happen
to
know
<EOS>
,
do
you
,
what
has
become
of
another
friend
of
yours
---
a
more
humble
one
,
whom
I
saw
at
Rochester
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dismal
Jemmy
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Jingle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jingle
shook
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Clever
rascal
---
queer
fellow
,
hoaxing
genius
---
Job
's
brother
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Job
's
brother
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
now
I
look
at
him
closely
,
there
IS
a
likeness
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
were
always
considered
like
each
other
,
Sir
,
"
said
Job
,
with
a
cunning
look
just
lurking
in
the
corners
of
his
eyes
,
"
only
I
was
really
of
a
serious
nature
,
and
he
never
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
emigrated
to
America
,
Sir
,
in
consequence
of
being
too
much
sought
after
here
,
to
be
comfortable
;
and
has
never
been
heard
of
since
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
accounts
for
my
not
having
received
the
"
page
from
the
romance
of
real
life
,
"
which
he
promised
me
one
morning
when
he
appeared
to
be
contemplating
suicide
on
Rochester
Bridge
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
inquire
whether
his
dismal
behaviour
was
natural
or
assumed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
could
assume
anything
,
Sir
,
"
said
Job
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
consider
yourself
very
fortunate
in
having
escaped
him
so
easily
.
 
<EOS>
On
intimate
terms
he
would
have
been
even
a
more
dangerous
acquaintance
than
---
"
<EOS>
Job
looked
at
Jingle
,
hesitated
,
and
finally
added
,
"
than
---
than
-
myself
even
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
hopeful
family
yours
,
Mr
Trotter
,
"
said
Perker
,
sealing
a
letter
which
he
had
just
finished
writing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Job
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
much
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
the
little
man
,
laughing
,
"
I
hope
you
are
going
to
disgrace
it
.
 
<EOS>
Deliver
this
letter
to
the
agent
when
you
reach
Liverpool
,
and
let
me
advise
you
,
gentlemen
,
not
to
be
too
knowing
in
the
West
Indies
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
throw
away
this
chance
,
you
will
both
richly
deserve
to
be
hanged
,
as
I
sincerely
trust
you
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
you
had
better
leave
Mr
Pickwick
and
me
alone
,
for
we
have
other
matters
to
talk
over
,
and
time
is
precious
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
Perker
said
this
,
he
looked
towards
the
door
,
with
an
evident
desire
to
render
the
leave
-
taking
as
brief
as
possible
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
brief
enough
on
Mr
Jingle
's
part
.
 
<EOS>
He
thanked
the
little
attorney
in
a
few
hurried
words
for
the
kindness
and
promptitude
with
which
he
had
rendered
his
assistance
,
and
,
turning
to
his
benefactor
,
stood
for
a
few
seconds
as
if
irresolute
what
to
say
or
how
to
act
.
 
<EOS>
Job
Trotter
relieved
his
perplexity
;
for
,
with
a
humble
and
grateful
bow
to
Mr
Pickwick
,
he
took
his
friend
gently
by
the
arm
,
and
led
him
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
worthy
couple
!
<EOS>
"
said
Perker
,
as
the
door
closed
behind
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
they
may
become
so
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
?
 
<EOS>
Is
there
any
chance
of
their
permanent
reformation
?
"
   
<EOS>
Perker
shrugged
his
shoulders
doubtfully
,
but
observing
Mr
Pickwick
's
anxious
and
disappointed
look
,
rejoined
---
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
there
is
a
chance
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
may
prove
a
good
one
.
<EOS>
They
are
unquestionably
penitent
now
;
but
then
,
you
know
,
they
have
the
recollection
of
very
recent
suffering
fresh
upon
them
.
<EOS>
What
they
may
become
,
when
that
fades
away
,
is
a
problem
that
neither
you
nor
I
can
solve
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
added
Perker
,
laying
his
hand
on
Mr
Pickwick
's
shoulder
,
"
your
object
is
equally
honourable
,
whatever
the
result
is
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
that
species
of
benevolence
which
is
so
very
cautious
and
long
-
sighted
that
it
is
seldom
exercised
at
all
,
lest
its
owner
should
be
imposed
upon
,
and
so
wounded
in
his
self
-
love
,
be
real
charity
or
a
worldly
counterfeit
,
I
leave
to
wiser
heads
than
mine
to
determine
.
<EOS>
But
if
those
two
fellows
were
to
commit
a
burglary
to
-
morrow
,
my
opinion
of
this
action
would
be
equally
high
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
remarks
,
which
were
delivered
in
a
much
more
animated
and
earnest
manner
than
is
usual
in
legal
gentlemen
,
Perker
drew
his
chair
to
his
desk
,
and
listened
to
Mr
Pickwick
's
recital
of
old
Mr
Winkle
's
obstinacy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Give
him
a
week
,
"
said
Perker
,
nodding
his
head
prophetically
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
he
will
come
round
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
will
,
"
rejoined
Perker
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
not
,
we
must
try
the
young
lady
's
persuasion
;
and
that
is
what
anybody
<EOS>
but
you
would
have
done
at
first
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Perker
was
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
with
various
grotesque
contractions
of
countenance
,
eulogistic
of
the
persuasive
powers
appertaining
unto
young
ladies
,
when
the
murmur
of
inquiry
and
answer
was
heard
in
the
outer
office
,
and
Lowten
tapped
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
in
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
little
man
.
   
<EOS>
The
clerk
came
in
,
and
shut
the
door
after
him
,
with
great
mystery
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Perker
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
wanted
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
wants
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
Lowten
looked
at
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
coughed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
wants
me
?
 
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
speak
,
Mr
Lowten
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
"
replied
Lowten
,
"
it
's
Dodson
;
and
Fogg
is
with
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
life
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
little
man
,
looking
at
his
watch
,
"
I
appointed
them
to
be
here
at
half
-
past
eleven
,
to
settle
that
matter
of
yours
,
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
them
an
undertaking
on
which
they
sent
down
your
discharge
;
it
's
very
awkward
,
my
dear
Sir
;
what
will
you
do
?
 
<EOS>
Would
you
like
to
step
into
the
next
room
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
next
room
being
the
identical
room
in
which
Messrs.
Dodson
&
Fogg
were
,
Mr
Pickwick
replied
that
he
would
remain
where
he
was
:
the
more
especially
as
Messrs.
Dodson
&
Fogg
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
look
him
in
the
face
,
instead
of
his
being
ashamed
to
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
Which
latter
circumstance
he
begged
Mr
Perker
to
note
,
with
a
glowing
countenance
and
many
marks
of
indignation
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
,
my
dear
Sir
,
very
well
,
"
replied
Perker

"
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that
if
you
expect
either
Dodson
or
Fogg
to
exhibit
any
symptom
of
shame
or
confusion
at
having
to
look
you
,
or
anybody
else
,
in
the
face
,
you
are
the
most
sanguine
man
in
your
expectations
that
I
ever
met
with
.
 
<EOS>
Show
them
in
,
Mr
Lowten
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lowten
disappeared
with
a
grin
,
and
immediately
returned
ushering
in
the
firm
,
in
due
form
of
precedence
---
Dodson
first
,
and
Fogg
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
Mr
Pickwick
,
I
believe
?
"
said
Perker
to
Dodson
,
inclining
his
pen
in
the
direction
where
that
gentleman
was
seated
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Mr
Pickwick
?
"
said
Dodson
,
in
a
loud
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
"
cried
Fogg
,
"
how
do
you
do
,
Mr
Pickwick
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
well
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
knew
the
face
,
"
said
Fogg
,
drawing
up
a
chair
,
and
looking
round
him
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
bent
his
head
very
slightly
,
in
answer
to
these
salutations
,
and
,
seeing
Fogg
pull
a
bundle
of
papers
from
his
coat
pocket
,
rose
and
walked
to
the
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
occasion
for
Mr
Pickwick
to
move
,
Mr
Perker
,
"
said
Fogg
,
untying
the
red
tape
which
encircled
the
little
bundle
,
and
smiling
again
more
sweetly
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pickwick
is
pretty
well
acquainted
with
these
proceedings
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
no
secrets
between
us
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
He
!
<EOS>
he
!
<EOS>
he
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
many
,
I
think
,
"
said
Dodson
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
both
the
partners
laughed
together
---
pleasantly
and
cheerfully
,
as
men
who
are
going
to
receive
money
often
do
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
shall
make
Mr
Pickwick
pay
for
peeping
,
"
said
Fogg
,
with
considerable
native
humour
,
as
he
unfolded
his
papers
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
amount
of
the
taxed
costs
is
one
hundred
and
thirty
-
three
,
six
,
four
,
Mr
Perker
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
comparing
of
papers
,
and
turning
over
of
leaves
,
by
Fogg
and
Perker
,
after
this
statement
of
profit
and
loss
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Dodson
said
,
in
an
affable
manner
,
to
Mr
Pickwick
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
you
are
looking
quite
so
stout
as
when
I
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
last
,
Mr
Pickwick
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Possibly
not
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
had
been
flashing
forth
looks
of
fierce
indignation
,
without
producing
the
smallest
effect
on
either
of
the
sharp
practitioners
;
"
I
believe
I
am
not
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
persecuted
and
annoyed
by
scoundrels
of
late
,
Sir
.
"
<EOS>
Perker
coughed
violently
,
and
asked
Mr
Pickwick
whether
he
would
n't
like
to
look
at
the
morning
paper
.
 
<EOS>
To
which
inquiry
Mr
Pickwick
returned
a
most
decided
negative
.
   
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
said
Dodson
,
"
I
dare
say
you
have
been
annoyed
in
the
Fleet
;
there
are
some
odd
gentry
there
.
 
<EOS>
Whereabouts
were
your
apartments
,
Mr
Pickwick
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
one
room
,
"
replied
that
much
-
injured
gentleman
,
"
was
on
the
coffee
-
room
flight
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
indeed
!
"
said
Dodson
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
that
is
a
very
pleasant
part
of
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
drily
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
coolness
about
all
this
,
which
,
to
a
gentleman
of
an
excitable
temperament
,
had
,
under
the
circumstances
,
rather
an
exasperating
tendency
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
restrained
his
wrath
by
gigantic
efforts
;
but
when
Perker
wrote
a
cheque
for
the
whole
amount
,
and
Fogg
deposited
it
in
a
small
pocket
-
book
,
with
a
triumphant
smile
playing
over
his
pimply
features
,
which
communicated
itself
likewise
to
the
stern
countenance
of
Dodson
,
he
felt
the
blood
in
his
cheeks
tingling
with
indignation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr
Dodson
,
"
said
Fogg
,
putting
up
the
pocket
-
book
and
drawing
on
his
gloves
,
"
I
am
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
said
Dodson
,
rising
;
"
I
am
quite
ready
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
happy
,
"
said
Fogg
,
softened
by
the
cheque
,
"
to
have
had
the
pleasure
of
making
Mr
Pickwick
's
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
do
n't
think
quite
so
ill
of
us
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
when
we
first
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
said
Dodson
,
with
the
high
tone
of
calumniated
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pickwick
now
knows
us
better
,
I
trust
;
whatever
your
opinion
of
gentlemen
of
our
profession
may
be
,
I
beg
to
assure
you
,
sir
,
that
I
bear
no
ill
-
will
or
vindictive
feeling
towards
you
for
the
sentiments
you
thought
proper
to
express
in
our
office
in
Freeman
's
Court
,
Cornhill
,
on
the
occasion
to
which
my
partner
has
referred
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
no
;
nor
I
,
"
said
Fogg
,
in
a
most
forgiving
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Our
conduct
,
Sir
,
"
said
Dodson
,
"
will
speak
for
itself
,
and
justify
itself
,
I
hope
,
upon
every
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
been
in
the
profession
some
years
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
have
been
honoured
with
the
confidence
of
many
excellent
clients
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
good
-
morning
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
morning
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
said
Fogg
.
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
put
his
umbrella
under
his
arm
,
drew
off
his
right
glove
,
and
extended
the
hand
of
reconciliation
to
that
most
indignant
gentleman
;
who
,
thereupon
,
thrust
his
hands
beneath
his
coat
tails
,
and
eyed
the
attorney
with
looks
of
scornful
amazement
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lowten
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Perker
,
at
this
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Open
the
door
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wait
one
instant
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perker
,
I
WILL
speak
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Sir
,
pray
let
the
matter
rest
where
it
is
,
"
said
the
little
attorney
,
who
had
been
in
a
state
of
nervous
apprehension
during
the
whole
interview
;
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
I
beg
---
"
   
"
I
will
not
be
put
down
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
hastily
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Dodson
,
you
have
addressed
some
remarks
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Dodson
turned
round
,
bent
his
head
meekly
,
and
smiled
.
   
<EOS>
"
Some
remarks
to
me
,
"
repeated
Mr
Pickwick
,
almost
breathless
;
"
and
your
partner
has
tendered
me
his
hand
,
and
you
have
both
assumed
a
tone
of
forgiveness
and
high
-
mindedness
,
which
is
an
extent
of
impudence
that
I
was
not
prepared
for
,
even
in
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
sir
!
"
exclaimed
Dodson
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
sir
!
"
reiterated
Fogg
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
that
I
have
been
the
victim
of
your
plots
and
conspiracies
?
<EOS>
"
continued
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
that
I
am
the
man
whom
you
have
been
imprisoning
and
robbing
?
<EOS>
Do
you
know
that
you
were
the
attorneys
for
the
plaintiff
,
in
Bardell
and
Pickwick
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
we
do
know
it
,
"
replied
Dodson
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
we
know
it
,
Sir
,
"
rejoined
Fogg
,
slapping
his
pocket
 
---
perhaps
by
accident
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
that
you
recollect
it
with
satisfaction
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
attempting
to
call
up
a
sneer
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
and
failing
most
signally
in
so
doing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Although
I
have
long
been
anxious
to
tell
you
,
in
plain
terms
,
what
my
opinion
of
you
is
,
I
should
have
let
even
this
opportunity
pass
,
in
deference
to
my
friend
Perker
's
wishes
,
but
for
the
unwarrantable
tone
you
have
assumed
,
and
your
insolent
familiarity
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
insolent
familiarity
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
turning
upon
Fogg
with
a
fierceness
of
gesture
which
caused
that
person
to
retreat
towards
the
door
with
great
expedition
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
care
,
Sir
,
"
said
Dodson
,
who
,
though
he
was
the
biggest
man
of
the
party
,
had
prudently
entrenched
himself
behind
Fogg
,
and
was
speaking
over
his
head
with
a
very
pale
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
him
assault
you
,
Mr
Fogg
;
do
n't
return
it
on
any
account
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
I
wo
n't
return
it
,
"
said
Fogg
,
falling
back
a
little
more
as
he
spoke
;
to
the
evident
relief
of
his
partner
,
who
by
these
means
was
gradually
getting
into
the
outer
office
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
,
"
continued
Mr
Pickwick
,
resuming
the
thread
of
his
discourse
---
"
you
are
a
well
-
matched
pair
of
mean
,
rascally
,
pettifogging
robbers
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
interposed
Perker
,
"
is
that
all
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
summed
up
in
that
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
they
are
mean
,
rascally
,
pettifogging
robbers
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
Perker
,
in
a
most
conciliatory
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sirs
,
he
has
said
all
he
has
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
Now
pray
go
.
 
<EOS>
Lowten
,
is
that
door
open
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lowten
,
with
a
distant
giggle
,
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
There
,
there
---
good
-
morning
---
good
-
morning
---
now
pray
,
my
dear
sirs
---
<EOS>
Mr
Lowten
,
the
door
!
"
cried
the
little
man
,
pushing
Dodson
&
Fogg
,
nothing
loath
,
out
of
the
office
;
"
this
way
,
my
dear
sirs
---
now
pray
do
n't
prolong
this
---
 
Dear
me
---
<EOS>
Mr
Lowten
---
the
door
,
sir
---
why
do
n't
you
attend
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
there
's
law
in
England
,
sir
,
"
said
Dodson
,
looking
towards
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
he
put
on
his
hat
,
"
you
shall
smart
for
this
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
couple
of
mean
---
"
   
"
Remember
,
sir
,
you
pay
dearly
for
this
,
"
said
Fogg
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
Rascally
,
pettifogging
robbers
!
"
<EOS>
continued
Mr
Pickwick
,
taking
not
the
least
notice
of
the
threats
that
were
addressed
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Robbers
!
"
cried
Mr
Pickwick
,
running
to
the
stair
-
head
,
as
the
two
attorneys
descended
.
   
<EOS>
"
Robbers
!
<EOS>
"
shouted
Mr
Pickwick
,
breaking
from
Lowten
and
Perker
,
and
thrusting
his
head
out
of
the
staircase
window
.
   
<EOS>
When
Mr
Pickwick
drew
in
his
head
again
,
his
countenance
was
smiling
and
placid
;
and
,
walking
quietly
back
into
the
office
,
he
declared
that
he
had
now
removed
a
great
weight
from
his
mind
,
and
that
he
felt
perfectly
comfortable
and
happy
.
   
<EOS>
Perker
said
nothing
at
all
until
he
had
emptied
his
snuff
-
box
,
and
sent
Lowten
out
to
fill
it
,
when
he
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
laughing
,
which
lasted
five
minutes
;
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
he
said
that
he
supposed
he
ought
to
be
very
angry
,
but
he
could
n't
think
of
the
business
seriously
yet
---
when
he
could
,
he
would
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
now
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
let
me
have
a
settlement
with
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
Of
the
same
kind
as
the
last
?
"
inquired
Perker
,
with
another
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
Not
exactly
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Pickwick
,
drawing
out
his
pocket
-
book
,
and
shaking
the
little
man
heartily
by
the
hand
,
"
I
only
mean
a
pecuniary
settlement
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
done
me
many
acts
of
kindness
that
I
can
never
repay
,
and
have
no
wish
to
repay
,
for
I
prefer
continuing
the
obligation
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
preface
,
the
two
friends
dived
into
some
very
complicated
accounts
and
vouchers
,
which
,
having
been
duly
displayed
and
gone
through
by
Perker
,
were
at
once
discharged
by
Mr
Pickwick
with
many
professions
of
esteem
and
friendship
.
   
<EOS>
They
had
no
sooner
arrived
at
this
point
,
than
<EOS>
a
most
violent
and
startling
knocking
was
heard
at
the
door
;
it
was
not
an
ordinary
double
-
knock
,
but
a
constant
and
uninterrupted
succession
of
the
loudest
single
raps
,
as
if
the
knocker
were
endowed
with
the
perpetual
motion
,
or
the
person
outside
had
forgotten
to
leave
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
what
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Perker
,
starting
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
a
knock
at
the
door
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
as
if
there
could
be
the
smallest
doubt
of
the
fact
.
   
<EOS>
The
knocker
made
a
more
energetic
reply
than
words
could
have
yielded
,
for
it
continued
to
hammer
with
surprising
force
and
noise
,
without
a
moment
's
cessation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
Perker
,
ringing
his
bell
,
"
we
shall
alarm
the
inn
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Lowten
,
do
n't
you
hear
a
knock
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
answer
the
door
in
one
moment
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
clerk
.
   
<EOS>
The
knocker
appeared
to
hear
the
response
,
and
to
assert
that
it
was
quite
impossible
he
could
wait
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
It
made
a
stupendous
uproar
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
dreadful
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
stopping
his
ears
.
   
<EOS>
"
Make
haste
,
Mr
Lowten
,
"
<EOS>
Perker
called
out
;
"
we
shall
have
the
panels
beaten
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lowten
,
who
was
washing
his
hands
in
a
dark
closet
,
hurried
to
the
door
,
and
turning
the
handle
,
beheld
the
appearance
which
is
described
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
54
.
<EOS>
Containing
some
particulars
relative
to
the
double
knock
,
and
other
matters
:
among
which
certain
interesting
disclosures
relative
to
Mr
Snodgrass
and
a
young
lady
are
by
no
means
irrelevant
to
this
history
 
<EOS>
The
object
that
presented
itself
to
the
eyes
of
the
astonished
clerk
,
was
a
boy
---
a
wonderfully
fat
boy
---
habited
as
a
serving
lad
,
standing
upright
on
the
mat
,
with
his
eyes
closed
as
if
in
sleep
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
seen
such
a
fat
boy
,
in
or
out
of
a
travelling
caravan
;
and
this
,
coupled
with
the
calmness
and
repose
of
his
appearance
,
so
very
different
from
what
was
reasonably
to
have
been
expected
of
the
inflicter
of
such
knocks
,
smote
him
with
wonder
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
clerk
.
   
<EOS>
The
extraordinary
boy
replied
not
a
word
;
but
he
nodded
once
,
and
seemed
,
to
the
clerk
's
imagination
,
to
snore
feebly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
do
you
come
from
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
clerk
.
   
<EOS>
The
boy
made
no
sign
.
 
<EOS>
He
breathed
heavily
,
but
in
all
other
respects
was
motionless
.
   
<EOS>
The
clerk
repeated
the
question
thrice
,
and
receiving
no
answer
,
prepared
to
shut
the
door
,
when
the
boy
suddenly
opened
his
eyes
,
winked
several
times
,
sneezed
once
,
and
raised
his
hand
as
if
to
repeat
the
knocking
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
the
door
open
,
he
stared
about
him
with
astonishment
,
and
at
length
fixed
his
eyes
on
Mr
Lowten
's
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
do
you
knock
in
that
way
for
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
clerk
angrily
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Which
way
?
"
said
the
boy
,
in
a
slow
and
sleepy
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
like
forty
hackney
-
coachmen
,
"
replied
the
clerk
.
   
<EOS>
"
Because
master
said
,
I
was
n't
to
leave
off
knocking
till
they
opened
the
door
,
for
fear
I
should
go
to
sleep
,
"
said
the
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
the
clerk
,
"
what
message
have
you
brought
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
downstairs
,
"
rejoined
the
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Master
.
 
<EOS>
He
wants
to
know
whether
you
're
at
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lowten
bethought
himself
,
at
this
juncture
,
of
looking
out
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
an
open
carriage
with
a
hearty
old
gentleman
in
it
,
looking
up
very
anxiously
,
he
ventured
to
beckon
him
;
on
which
,
the
old
gentleman
jumped
out
directly
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
your
master
in
the
carriage
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Lowten
.
   
<EOS>
The
boy
nodded
.
   
<EOS>
All
further
inquiries
were
superseded
by
the
appearance
of
old
Wardle
,
who
,
running
upstairs
and
just
recognising
Lowten
,
passed
at
once
into
Mr
Perker
's
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pickwick
!
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
hand
,
my
boy
!
 
<EOS>
Why
have
I
never
heard
until
the
day
before
yesterday
of
your
suffering
yourself
to
be
cooped
up
in
jail
?
 
<EOS>
And
why
did
you
let
him
do
it
,
Perker
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
help
it
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
replied
Perker
,
with
a
smile
and
a
pinch
of
snuff
;
"
you
know
how
obstinate
he
is
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
do
;
of
course
I
do
,
"
replied
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
heartily
glad
to
see
him
,
notwithstanding
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
lose
sight
of
him
again
,
in
a
hurry
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
Wardle
shook
Mr
Pickwick
's
hand
once
more
,
and
,
having
done
the
same
by
Perker
,
threw
himself
into
an
arm
-
chair
,
his
jolly
red
face
shining
again
with
smiles
and
health
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
are
pretty
goings
on
---
a
pinch
of
your
snuff
,
Perker
,
my
boy
---
never
were
such
times
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mean
!
"
replied
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
think
the
girls
are
all
running
mad
<EOS>
;
that
's
no
news
,
you
'll
say
?
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
's
not
;
but
it
's
true
,
for
all
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
come
up
to
London
,
of
all
places
in
the
world
,
to
tell
us
that
,
my
dear
Sir
,
have
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Perker
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
altogether
,
"
replied
Wardle
;
"
though
it
was
the
main
cause
of
my
coming
.
 
<EOS>
How
's
Arabella
?
"
   
"
Very
well
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
and
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Black
-
eyed
little
jilt
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
had
a
great
idea
of
marrying
her
myself
,
one
of
these
odd
days
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
glad
of
it
too
,
very
glad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
did
the
intelligence
reach
you
?
"
asked
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
came
to
my
girls
,
of
course
,
"
replied
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Arabella
wrote
,
the
day
before
yesterday
,
to
say
she
had
made
a
stolen
match
without
her
husband
's
father
's
consent
,
and
so
you
had
gone
down
to
get
it
when
his
refusing
it
could
n't
prevent
the
match
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
it
a
very
good
time
to
say
something
serious
to
my
girls
;
so
I
said
what
a
dreadful
thing
it
was
that
children
should
marry
without
their
parents
"
consent
,
and
so
forth
;
but
,
bless
your
hearts
,
I
could
n't
make
the
least
impression
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
thought
it
such
a
much
more
dreadful
thing
that
there
should
have
been
a
wedding
without
bridesmaids
,
that
I
might
as
well
have
preached
to
Joe
himself
.
<EOS>
"
Here
the
old
gentleman
stopped
to
laugh
;
and
having
done
so
to
his
heart
's
content
,
presently
resumed
---
   
"
<EOS>
But
this
is
not
the
best
of
it
,
it
seems
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
only
half
the
love
-
making
and
plotting
that
have
been
going
forward
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
been
walking
on
mines
for
the
last
six
months
,
and
they
're
sprung
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mr
Pickwick
,
turning
pale
;
"
no
other
secret
marriage
,
I
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
<EOS>
no
,
"
replied
old
Wardle
;
"
not
so
bad
as
that
;
no
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
then
?
"
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
am
I
interested
in
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
answer
that
question
,
Perker
?
"
said
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
commit
yourself
by
doing
so
,
my
dear
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
you
are
,
"
said
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
asked
Mr
Pickwick
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
what
way
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
Really
,
"
replied
Wardle
<EOS>
,
"
you
're
such
a
fiery
sort
of
a
young
fellow
that
I
am
almost
afraid
to
tell
you
;
but
,
however
,
if
Perker
will
sit
between
us
to
prevent
mischief
,
I
'll
venture
.
"
   
<EOS>
Having
closed
the
room
door
,
and
fortified
himself
with
another
application
to
Perker
's
snuff
-
box
,
the
old
gentleman
proceeded
with
his
great
disclosure
in
these
words
---
   
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
that
my
daughter
Bella
---
Bella
,
who
married
young
Trundle
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
we
know
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
impatiently
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
alarm
me
at
the
very
beginning
.
 
<EOS>
My
daughter
Bella
---
Emily
having
gone
to
bed
with
a
headache
after
she
had
read
Arabella
's
letter
to
me
---
sat
herself
down
by
my
side
the
other
evening
,
and
began
to
talk
over
this
marriage
affair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
pa
,
"
she
says
,
"
what
do
you
think
of
it
?
"
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
suppose
it
's
all
very
well
;
I
hope
it
's
for
the
best
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
answered
in
this
way
because
I
was
sitting
before
the
fire
at
the
time
,
drinking
my
grog
rather
thoughtfully
,
and
<EOS>
I
knew
my
throwing
in
an
undecided
word
now
and
then
,
would
induce
her
to
continue
talking
.
<EOS>
Both
my
girls
are
pictures
of
their
dear
mother
,
and
as
I
grow
old
I
like
to
sit
with
only
them
by
me
;
for
their
voices
and
looks
carry
me
back
to
the
happiest
period
of
my
life
,
and
make
me
,
for
the
moment
,
as
young
as
I
used
to
be
then
,
though
not
quite
so
light
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
a
marriage
of
affection
,
pa
,
"
said
Bella
,
after
a
short
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
"
said
I
,
"
but
such
marriages
do
not
always
turn
out
the
happiest
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
I
question
that
,
mind
!
<EOS>
"
interposed
Mr
Pickwick
warmly
.
"
Very
good
,
"
responded
Wardle
,
"
question
anything
you
like
when
it
's
your
turn
to
speak
,
but
do
n't
interrupt
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Granted
,
"
replied
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
"
I
am
sorry
to
hear
you
express
your
opinion
against
marriages
of
affection
,
pa
,
"
said
Bella
,
colouring
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
wrong
;
I
ought
not
to
have
said
so
,
my
dear
,
either
,
"
said
I
,
patting
her
cheek
as
kindly
as
a
rough
old
fellow
like
me
could
pat
it
,
"
for
your
mother
's
was
one
,
and
so
was
yours
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
that
I
meant
,
pa
,
"
said
Bella
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
pa
,
I
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
Emily
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
Mr
Pickwick
started
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
now
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Wardle
,
stopping
in
his
narrative
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
could
spin
out
a
story
,
"
said
Wardle
abruptly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
come
out
,
sooner
or
later
,
and
it
'll
save
us
all
a
great
deal
of
time
if
it
comes
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
The
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
,
then
,
that
Bella
at
last
mustered
up
courage
to
tell
me
that
Emily
was
very
unhappy
;
that
she
and
your
young
friend
Snodgrass
had
been
in
constant
correspondence
and
communication
ever
since
last
Christmas
;
that
she
had
very
dutifully
made
up
her
mind
to
run
away
with
him
,
in
laudable
imitation
of
her
old
friend
and
school
-
fellow
;
but
that
having
some
compunctions
of
conscience
on
the
subject
,
inasmuch
as
I
had
always
been
rather
kindly
disposed
to
both
of
them
,
they
had
thought
it
better
in
the
first
instance
to
pay
me
the
compliment
of
asking
whether
I
would
have
any
objection
to
their
being
married
in
the
usual
matter
-
of
-
fact
manner
.
 
<EOS>
There
now
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
if
you
can
make
it
convenient
to
reduce
your
eyes
to
their
usual
size
again
,
and
to
let
me
hear
what
you
think
we
ought
to
do
,
I
shall
feel
rather
obliged
to
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
testy
manner
in
which
the
hearty
old
gentleman
uttered
this
last
sentence
was
not
wholly
unwarranted
;
for
Mr
Pickwick
's
face
had
settled
down
into
an
expression
of
blank
amazement
and
perplexity
,
quite
curious
to
behold
.
   
<EOS>
"
Snodgrass!-since
<EOS>
last
Christmas
!
"
were
the
first
broken
words
that
issued
from
the
lips
of
the
confounded
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Since
last
Christmas
,
"
replied
Wardle
<EOS>
;
"
that
's
plain
enough
,
and
very
bad
spectacles
we
must
have
worn
,
not
to
have
discovered
it
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
it
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
ruminating
;
"
I
can
not
really
understand
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
easy
enough
to
understand
it
,
"
replied
the
choleric
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
been
a
younger
man
,
you
would
have
been
in
the
secret
long
ago
;
and
besides
,
"
added
Wardle
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
"
the
truth
is
,
that
,
knowing
nothing
of
this
matter
,
I
have
rather
pressed
Emily
for
four
or
five
months
past
,
to
receive
favourably
(
if
she
could
;
I
would
never
attempt
to
force
a
girl
's
inclinations
)
<EOS>
the
addresses
of
a
young
gentleman
down
in
our
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
that
,
girl
-
like
,
to
enhance
her
own
value
and
increase
the
ardour
of
Mr
Snodgrass
,
she
has
represented
this
matter
in
very
glowing
colours
,
and
that
they
have
both
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
they
are
a
terribly
-
persecuted
pair
of
unfortunates
,
and
have
no
resource
but
clandestine
matrimony
,
or
charcoal
.
 
<EOS>
Now
the
question
is
,
what
's
to
be
done
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
have
YOU
done
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
what
did
you
do
when
your
married
daughter
told
you
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
made
a
fool
of
myself
of
course
,
"
rejoined
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Just
so
,
"
interposed
Perker
,
who
had
accompanied
this
dialogue
with
sundry
twitchings
of
his
watch
-
chain
,
vindictive
rubbings
of
his
nose
,
and
other
symptoms
of
impatience
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
very
natural
;
but
how
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
went
into
a
great
passion
and
frightened
my
mother
into
a
fit
,
"
said
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
was
judicious
,
"
remarked
Perker
;
"
and
what
else
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
fretted
and
fumed
all
next
day
,
and
raised
a
great
disturbance
,
"
rejoined
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
last
I
got
tired
of
rendering
myself
unpleasant
and
making
everybody
miserable
;
so
I
hired
a
carriage
at
Muggleton
,
and
,
putting
my
own
horses
in
it
,
came
up
to
town
,
under
pretence
of
bringing
Emily
to
see
Arabella
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Miss
Wardle
is
with
you
,
then
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
she
is
,
"
replied
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
at
Osborne
's
Hotel
in
the
Adelphi
at
this
moment
,
unless
your
enterprising
friend
has
run
away
with
her
since
I
came
out
this
morning
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
reconciled
then
?
"
said
Perker
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
"
answered
Wardle
;
"
she
has
been
crying
and
moping
ever
since
,
except
last
night
,
between
tea
and
supper
,
when
she
made
a
great
parade
of
writing
a
letter
that
I
pretended
to
take
no
notice
of
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
want
my
advice
in
this
matter
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
said
Perker
,
looking
from
the
musing
face
of
Mr
Pickwick
to
the
eager
countenance
of
Wardle
,
and
taking
several
consecutive
pinches
of
his
favourite
stimulant
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
,
"
said
Wardle
,
looking
at
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
replied
that
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
"
said
Perker
,
rising
and
pushing
his
chair
back
,
"
my
advice
is
,
that
you
both
walk
away
together
,
or
ride
away
,
or
get
away
by
some
means
or
other
,
for
I
'm
tired
of
you
,
and
just
talk
this
matter
over
between
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
not
settled
it
by
the
next
time
I
see
you
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
to
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
satisfactory
,
"
said
Wardle
,
hardly
knowing
whether
to
smile
or
be
offended
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pooh
,
pooh
,
my
dear
Sir
,
"
returned
Perker
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
both
a
great
deal
better
than
you
know
yourselves
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
settled
it
already
,
to
all
intents
and
purposes
.
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
expressing
himself
,
the
little
gentleman
poked
his
snuff
-
box
first
into
the
chest
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
then
into
the
waistcoat
of
Mr
Wardle
,
upon
which
they
all
three
laughed
,
especially
the
two
last
-
named
gentlemen
,
who
at
once
shook
hands
again
,
without
any
obvious
or
particular
reason
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
dine
with
me
to
-
day
,
"
said
Wardle
to
Perker
,
as
he
showed
them
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
promise
,
my
dear
Sir
,
ca
n't
promise
,
"
replied
Perker
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
look
in
,
in
the
evening
,
at
all
events
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
expect
you
at
five
,
"
said
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Joe
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
Joe
having
been
at
length
awakened
,
the
two
friends
departed
in
Mr
Wardle
's
carriage
,
which
in
common
humanity
had
a
dickey
behind
for
the
fat
boy
,
who
,
if
there
had
been
a
footboard
instead
,
would
have
rolled
off
and
killed
himself
in
his
very
first
nap
.
   
<EOS>
Driving
to
the
George
and
Vulture
,
they
found
that
Arabella
and
her
maid
had
sent
for
a
hackney
-
coach
immediately
on
the
receipt
of
a
short
note
from
Emily
announcing
her
arrival
in
town
,
and
had
proceeded
straight
to
the
Adelphi
.
 
<EOS>
As
Wardle
had
business
to
transact
in
the
city
,
they
sent
the
carriage
and
the
fat
boy
to
his
hotel
,
with
the
information
that
he
and
Mr
Pickwick
would
return
together
to
dinner
at
five
o'clock
.
   
<EOS>
Charged
with
this
message
,
the
fat
boy
returned
,
slumbering
as
peaceably
in
his
dickey
,
over
the
stones
,
as
if
it
had
been
a
down
bed
on
watch
springs
.
 
<EOS>
By
some
extraordinary
miracle
he
awoke
of
his
own
accord
,
when
the
coach
stopped
,
and
giving
himself
a
good
shake
to
stir
up
his
faculties
,
went
upstairs
to
execute
his
commission
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
whether
the
shake
had
jumbled
the
fat
boy
's
faculties
together
,
instead
of
arranging
them
in
proper
order
,
or
had
roused
such
a
quantity
of
new
ideas
within
him
as
to
render
him
oblivious
of
ordinary
forms
and
ceremonies
,
or
(
which
is
also
possible
)
had
proved
unsuccessful
in
preventing
his
falling
asleep
as
he
ascended
the
stairs
,
it
is
an
undoubted
fact
that
he
walked
into
the
sitting
-
room
without
previously
knocking
at
the
door
;
and
so
beheld
a
gentleman
with
his
arms
clasping
his
young
mistress
's
waist
,
sitting
very
lovingly
by
her
side
on
a
sofa
,
while
Arabella
and
her
pretty
handmaid
feigned
to
be
absorbed
in
looking
out
of
a
window
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
sight
of
this
phenomenon
,
the
fat
boy
uttered
an
interjection
,
the
ladies
a
scream
,
and
the
gentleman
an
oath
,
almost
simultaneously
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wretched
creature
,
what
do
you
want
here
?
"
said
the
gentleman
,
who
it
is
needless
to
say
was
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
To
this
<EOS>
the
fat
boy
,
considerably
terrified
,
briefly
responded
,
"
Missis
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
me
for
,
"
inquired
Emily
,
turning
her
head
aside
,
"
you
stupid
creature
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Master
and
Mr
Pickwick
is
a
-
going
to
dine
here
at
five
,
"
replied
the
fat
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Leave
the
room
!
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
,
glaring
upon
the
bewildered
youth
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
added
Emily
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bella
,
dear
,
advise
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Emily
and
Mr
Snodgrass
,
and
Arabella
and
Mary
,
crowded
into
a
corner
,
and
conversed
earnestly
in
whispers
for
some
minutes
,
during
which
the
fat
boy
dozed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Joe
,
"
said
Arabella
,
at
length
,
looking
round
with
a
most
bewitching
smile
,
"
how
do
you
do
,
Joe
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Joe
,
"
said
Emily
,
"
you
're
a
very
good
boy
;
I
wo
n't
forget
you
,
Joe
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Joe
,
"
said
Mr
Snodgrass
,
advancing
to
the
astonished
youth
,
and
seizing
his
hand
,
"
I
did
n't
know
you
before
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
five
shillings
for
you
,
Joe
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
owe
you
five
,
Joe
,
"
said
Arabella
,
"
for
old
acquaintance
sake
,
you
know
;
"
and
another
most
captivating
smile
was
bestowed
upon
the
corpulent
intruder
.
   
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
's
perception
being
slow
,
he
looked
rather
puzzled
at
first
to
account
for
this
sudden
prepossession
in
his
favour
,
and
stared
about
him
in
a
very
alarming
manner
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
his
broad
face
began
to
show
symptoms
of
a
grin
of
proportionately
broad
dimensions
;
and
then
,
thrusting
half
-
a
-
crown
into
each
of
his
pockets
,
and
a
hand
and
wrist
after
it
,
he
burst
into
a
horse
laugh
:
being
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
his
existence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
understands
us
,
I
see
,
"
said
Arabella
.
<EOS>
"
He
had
better
have
something
to
eat
,
immediately
,
"
remarked
Emily
.
   
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
almost
laughed
again
when
he
heard
this
suggestion
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
after
a
little
more
whispering
,
tripped
forth
from
the
group
and
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
dine
with
you
to
-
day
,
sir
,
if
you
have
no
objection
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
way
,
"
said
the
fat
boy
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
such
a
jolly
meat
-
pie
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
the
fat
boy
led
the
way
downstairs
;
his
pretty
companion
captivating
all
the
waiters
and
angering
all
the
chambermaids
as
she
followed
him
to
the
eating
-
room
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
the
meat
-
pie
of
which
the
youth
had
spoken
so
feelingly
,
and
there
were
,
moreover
,
a
steak
,
and
a
dish
of
potatoes
,
and
a
pot
of
porter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
"
said
the
fat
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
eye
,
how
prime
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
SO
hungry
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Having
apostrophised
his
eye
,
in
a
species
of
rapture
,
five
or
six
times
,
the
youth
took
the
head
of
the
little
table
,
and
Mary
seated
herself
at
the
bottom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
have
some
of
this
?
"
said
the
fat
boy
,
plunging
into
the
pie
up
to
the
very
ferules
of
the
knife
and
fork
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
little
,
if
you
please
,
"
replied
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
assisted
Mary
to
a
little
,
and
himself
to
a
great
deal
,
and
was
just
going
to
begin
eating
when
he
suddenly
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
,
and
letting
his
hands
,
with
the
knife
and
fork
in
them
,
fall
on
his
knees
,
said
,
very
slowly
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
 
<EOS>
How
nice
you
look
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
said
in
an
admiring
manner
,
and
was
,
so
far
,
gratifying
;
but
still
there
was
enough
of
the
cannibal
in
the
young
gentleman
's
eyes
to
render
the
compliment
a
double
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
Joseph
,
"
said
Mary
,
affecting
to
blush
,
"
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
,
gradually
recovering
his
former
position
,
replied
with
a
heavy
sigh
,
and
,
remaining
thoughtful
for
a
few
moments
,
drank
a
long
draught
of
the
porter
.
 
<EOS>
Having
achieved
this
feat
,
he
sighed
again
,
and
applied
himself
assiduously
to
the
pie
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
nice
young
lady
Miss
Emily
is
!
"
<EOS>
said
Mary
,
after
a
long
silence
.
   
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
had
by
this
time
finished
the
pie
.
 
<EOS>
He
fixed
his
eyes
on
Mary
,
and
replied
---
"
I
knows
a
nicerer
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
"
said
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
!
"
replied
the
fat
boy
,
with
unwonted
vivacity
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
her
name
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
yours
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mary
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
's
hers
,
"
said
the
fat
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
boy
grinned
to
add
point
to
the
compliment
,
and
put
his
eyes
into
something
between
a
squint
and
a
cast
,
which
there
is
reason
to
believe
he
intended
for
an
ogle
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
n't
talk
to
me
in
that
way
,
"
said
Mary
;
"
you
do
n't
mean
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
I
,
though
?
"
replied
the
fat
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
come
here
regular
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
rejoined
Mary
,
shaking
her
head
,
"
I
'm
going
away
again
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Why
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
said
the
fat
boy
,
in
a
tone
of
strong
feeling
;
"
how
we
should
have
enjoyed
ourselves
at
meals
,
if
you
had
been
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
might
come
here
sometimes
,
perhaps
,
to
see
you
,
"
said
Mary
,
plaiting
the
table
-
cloth
in
assumed
coyness
,
"
if
you
would
do
me
a
favour
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
looked
from
the
pie
-
dish
to
the
steak
,
as
if
he
thought
a
favour
must
be
in
a
manner
connected
with
something
to
eat
;
and
then
took
out
one
of
the
half
-
crowns
and
glanced
at
it
nervously
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
understand
me
?
"
said
Mary
,
looking
slily
in
his
fat
face
.
   
<EOS>
Again
he
looked
at
the
half
-
crown
,
and
said
faintly
,
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
ladies
want
you
not
to
say
anything
to
the
old
gentleman
about
the
young
gentleman
having
been
upstairs
;
and
I
want
you
too
.
"
   
,
is
that
all
?
"
said
the
fat
boy
,
evidently
very
much
relieved
,
as
he
pocketed
the
half
-
crown
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
ai
n't
a
-
going
to
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
is
very
fond
of
Miss
Emily
,
and
Miss
Emily
's
very
fond
of
him
,
and
if
you
were
to
tell
about
it
,
the
old
gentleman
would
carry
you
all
away
miles
into
the
country
,
where
you
'd
see
nobody
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
I
wo
n't
tell
,
"
said
the
fat
boy
stoutly
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
dear
,
"
said
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
it
's
time
I
went
upstairs
,
and
got
my
lady
ready
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
n't
go
yet
,
"
urged
the
fat
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
,
"
replied
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
for
the
present
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
,
with
elephantine
playfulness
,
stretched
out
his
arms
to
ravish
a
kiss
;
but
as
it
required
no
great
agility
to
elude
him
,
his
fair
enslaver
had
vanished
before
he
closed
them
again
;
upon
which
the
apathetic
youth
ate
a
pound
or
so
of
steak
with
a
sentimental
countenance
,
and
fell
fast
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
so
much
to
say
upstairs
,
and
there
were
so
many
plans
to
concert
for
elopement
and
matrimony
in
the
event
of
old
Wardle
continuing
to
be
cruel
,
that
it
wanted
only
half
an
hour
of
dinner
when
Mr
Snodgrass
took
his
final
adieu
.
 
<EOS>
The
ladies
ran
to
Emily
's
bedroom
to
dress
,
and
the
lover
,
taking
up
his
hat
,
walked
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
got
outside
the
door
,
when
he
heard
Wardle
's
voice
talking
loudly
,
and
looking
over
the
banisters
<EOS>
beheld
him
,
followed
by
some
other
gentlemen
,
coming
straight
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
Knowing
nothing
of
the
house
,
Mr
Snodgrass
in
his
confusion
stepped
hastily
back
into
the
room
he
had
just
quitted
,
and
passing
thence
into
an
inner
apartment
(
Mr
Wardle
's
bedchamber
)
,
closed
the
door
softly
,
just
as
the
persons
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
entered
the
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
These
were
Mr
Wardle
,
Mr
Pickwick
,
Mr
Nathaniel
Winkle
,
and
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
,
whom
he
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
by
their
voices
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
lucky
I
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
avoid
them
,
"
thought
Mr
Snodgrass
with
a
smile
,
and
walking
on
tiptoe
to
another
door
near
the
bedside
;
"
this
opens
into
the
same
passage
,
and
I
can
walk
quietly
and
comfortably
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
obstacle
to
his
walking
quietly
and
comfortably
away
,
which
was
that
the
door
was
locked
and
the
key
gone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
us
have
some
of
your
best
wine
to
-
day
,
waiter
,
"
said
old
Wardle
,
rubbing
his
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
some
of
the
very
best
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
waiter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
the
ladies
know
we
have
come
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Devoutly
and
ardently
did
Mr
Snodgrass
wish
that
the
ladies
could
know
he
had
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
He
ventured
once
to
whisper
,
"
Waiter
!
"
<EOS>
through
the
keyhole
,
but
the
probability
of
the
wrong
waiter
coming
to
his
relief
,
flashed
upon
his
mind
,
together
with
a
sense
of
the
strong
resemblance
between
his
own
situation
and
that
in
which
another
gentleman
had
been
recently
found
in
a
neighbouring
hotel
(
an
account
of
whose
misfortunes
had
appeared
under
the
head
of
"
Police
"
in
that
morning
's
paper
)
,
he
sat
himself
on
a
portmanteau
,
and
trembled
violently
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
wo
n't
wait
a
minute
for
Perker
,
"
said
Wardle
,
looking
at
his
watch
;
"
he
is
always
exact
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
be
here
,
in
time
,
if
he
means
to
come
;
and
if
he
does
not
,
it
's
of
no
use
waiting
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
 
<EOS>
Arabella
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
sister
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
,
folding
her
in
a
most
romantic
embrace
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Ben
,
dear
,
how
you
do
smell
of
tobacco
,
"
said
Arabella
,
rather
overcome
by
this
mark
of
affection
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
I
?
"
said
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
I
,
Bella
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
perhaps
I
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
did
,
having
just
left
a
pleasant
little
smoking
-
party
of
twelve
medical
students
,
in
a
small
back
parlour
with
a
large
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
delighted
to
see
you
,
"
said
Mr
Ben
Allen
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
,
Bella
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
said
Arabella
,
bending
forward
to
kiss
her
brother
;
"
do
n't
take
hold
of
me
again
,
Ben
,
dear
,
because
you
tumble
me
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
At
this
point
of
the
reconciliation
,
Mr
Ben
Allen
allowed
his
feelings
and
the
cigars
and
porter
to
overcome
him
,
and
looked
round
upon
the
beholders
with
damp
spectacles
.
   
<EOS>
"
is
nothing
to
be
said
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Wardle
,
with
open
arms
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
great
deal
,
"
whispered
Arabella
,
as
she
received
the
old
gentleman
's
hearty
caress
and
congratulation
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
hard
-
hearted
,
unfeeling
,
cruel
monster
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
little
rebel
,
"
replied
Wardle
,
in
the
same
tone
,
"
and
I
am
afraid
I
shall
be
obliged
to
forbid
you
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
People
like
you
,
who
get
married
in
spite
of
everybody
,
ought
not
to
be
let
loose
on
society
.
 
<EOS>
But
come
!
"
<EOS>
added
the
old
gentleman
aloud
,
"
here
's
the
dinner
;
you
shall
sit
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
;
why
,
damn
the
boy
,
he
's
awake
!
"
   
<EOS>
To
the
great
distress
of
his
master
,
the
fat
boy
was
indeed
in
a
state
of
remarkable
vigilance
,
his
eyes
being
wide
open
,
and
looking
as
if
they
intended
to
remain
so
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
alacrity
in
his
manner
,
too
,
which
was
equally
unaccountable
;
every
time
his
eyes
met
those
of
Emily
or
Arabella
,
he
smirked
and
grinned
;
once
,
Wardle
could
have
sworn
,
he
saw
him
wink
.
   
<EOS>
This
alteration
in
the
fat
boy
's
demeanour
originated
in
his
increased
sense
of
his
own
importance
,
and
the
dignity
he
acquired
from
having
been
taken
into
the
confidence
of
the
young
ladies
;
and
the
smirks
,
and
grins
,
and
winks
were
so
many
condescending
assurances
that
they
might
depend
upon
his
fidelity
.
 
<EOS>
As
these
tokens
were
rather
calculated
to
awaken
suspicion
than
allay
it
,
and
were
somewhat
embarrassing
besides
,
they
were
occasionally
answered
by
a
frown
or
shake
of
the
head
from
Arabella
,
which
the
fat
boy
,
considering
as
hints
to
be
on
his
guard
,
expressed
his
perfect
understanding
of
,
by
smirking
,
grinning
,
and
winking
,
with
redoubled
assiduity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Joe
,
"
said
Mr
Wardle
,
after
an
unsuccessful
search
in
all
his
pockets
,
"
is
my
snuff
-
box
on
the
sofa
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
fat
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
recollect
;
I
left
it
on
my
dressing
-
table
this
morning
,
"
said
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Run
into
the
next
room
and
fetch
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
went
into
the
next
room
;
and
,
having
been
absent
about
a
minute
,
returned
with
the
snuff
-
box
,
and
the
palest
face
that
ever
a
fat
boy
wore
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
with
the
boy
?
"
exclaimed
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nothen
's
the
matter
with
me
,
"
replied
Joe
nervously
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
been
seeing
any
spirits
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Or
taking
any
?
<EOS>
"
added
Ben
Allen
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
're
right
,
"
whispered
Wardle
across
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
intoxicated
,
I
'm
sure
.
"
   
<EOS>
Ben
Allen
replied
that
he
thought
he
was
;
and
,
as
that
gentleman
had
seen
a
vast
deal
of
the
disease
in
question
,
Wardle
was
confirmed
in
an
impression
which
had
been
hovering
about
his
mind
for
half
an
hour
,
and
at
once
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
the
fat
boy
was
drunk
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
keep
your
eye
upon
him
for
a
few
minutes
,
"
murmured
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
soon
find
out
whether
he
is
or
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
youth
had
only
interchanged
a
dozen
words
with
Mr
Snodgrass
,
that
gentleman
having
implored
him
to
make
a
private
appeal
to
some
friend
to
release
him
,
and
then
pushed
him
out
with
the
snuff
-
box
,
lest
his
prolonged
absence
should
lead
to
a
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
He
ruminated
a
little
with
a
most
disturbed
expression
of
face
,
and
left
the
room
in
search
of
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
But
Mary
had
gone
home
after
dressing
her
mistress
,
and
the
fat
boy
came
back
again
more
disturbed
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
Wardle
and
Mr
Ben
Allen
exchanged
glances
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Joe
!
"
said
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
go
away
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
looked
hopelessly
in
the
face
of
everybody
at
table
,
and
stammered
out
that
he
did
n't
know
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
said
Wardle
,
"
you
do
n't
know
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Take
this
cheese
to
Mr
Pickwick
.
"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr
Pickwick
being
in
the
very
best
health
and
spirits
,
had
been
making
himself
perfectly
delightful
all
dinner
-
time
,
and
was
at
this
moment
engaged
in
an
energetic
conversation
with
Emily
and
Mr
Winkle
;
bowing
his
head
,
courteously
,
in
the
emphasis
of
his
discourse
,
gently
waving
his
left
hand
to
lend
force
to
his
observations
,
and
all
glowing
with
placid
smiles
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
a
piece
of
cheese
from
the
plate
,
and
was
on
the
point
of
turning
round
to
renew
the
conversation
,
when
the
fat
boy
,
stooping
so
as
to
bring
his
head
on
a
level
with
that
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
pointed
with
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
,
and
made
the
most
horrible
and
hideous
face
that
was
ever
seen
out
of
a
Christmas
pantomime
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
starting
,
"
<EOS>
what
a
very
---
Eh
?
"
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
for
the
fat
boy
had
drawn
himself
up
,
and
was
,
or
pretended
to
be
,
fast
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
such
an
extremely
singular
lad
!
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
uneasily
at
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
seems
an
odd
thing
to
say
,
but
upon
my
word
I
am
afraid
that
,
at
times
,
he
is
a
little
deranged
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
pray
do
n't
say
so
,
"
cried
Emily
and
Arabella
,
both
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
certain
,
of
course
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
amidst
profound
silence
and
looks
of
general
dismay
;
"
but
his
manner
to
me
this
moment
really
was
very
alarming
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
ejaculated
Mr
Pickwick
,
suddenly
jumping
up
with
a
short
scream
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
ladies
,
but
at
that
moment
he
ran
some
sharp
instrument
into
my
leg
.
 
<EOS>
Really
,
he
is
not
safe
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
drunk
,
"
roared
old
Wardle
passionately
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ring
the
bell
!
<EOS>
Call
the
waiters
!
 
<EOS>
He
's
drunk
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
,
"
said
the
fat
boy
,
falling
on
his
knees
as
his
master
seized
him
by
the
collar
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
drunk
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
're
mad
;
that
's
worse
.
 
<EOS>
Call
the
waiters
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
mad
;
I
'm
sensible
,
"
rejoined
the
fat
boy
,
beginning
to
cry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
what
the
devil
did
you
run
sharp
instruments
into
Mr
Pickwick
's
legs
for
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Wardle
angrily
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
would
n't
look
at
me
,
"
replied
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wanted
to
speak
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
want
to
say
?
"
asked
half
a
dozen
voices
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
The
fat
boy
gasped
,
looked
at
the
bedroom
door
,
gasped
again
,
and
wiped
two
tears
away
with
the
knuckle
of
each
of
his
forefingers
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
want
to
say
?
"
demanded
Wardle
,
shaking
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
allow
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
you
wish
to
communicate
to
me
,
my
poor
boy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
whisper
to
you
,
"
replied
the
fat
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
bite
his
ear
off
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
come
near
him
;
he
's
vicious
;
ring
the
bell
,
and
let
him
be
taken
downstairs
.
"
   
<EOS>
Just
as
Mr
Winkle
caught
the
bell
-
rope
in
his
hand
,
it
was
arrested
by
a
general
expression
of
astonishment
;
the
captive
lover
,
his
face
burning
with
confusion
,
suddenly
walked
in
from
the
bedroom
,
and
made
a
comprehensive
bow
to
the
company
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wardle
,
releasing
the
fat
boy
's
collar
,
and
staggering
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
concealed
in
the
next
room
,
sir
,
since
you
returned
,
"
explained
Mr
Snodgrass
.
   
<EOS>
"
Emily
,
my
girl
,
"
said
Wardle
reproachfully
,
"
I
detest
meanness
and
deceit
;
this
is
unjustifiable
and
indelicate
in
the
highest
degree
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
deserve
this
at
your
hands
,
Emily
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
papa
,
"
said
Emily
,
"
Arabella
knows
<EOS>
---
everybody
here
knows
---
<EOS>
Joe
knows
---
that
I
was
no
party
to
this
concealment
.
<EOS>
Augustus
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
explain
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
,
who
had
only
waited
for
a
hearing
,
at
once
recounted
how
he
had
been
placed
in
his
then
distressing
predicament
;
how
the
fear
of
giving
rise
to
domestic
dissensions
had
alone
prompted
him
to
avoid
Mr
Wardle
on
his
entrance
;
how
he
merely
meant
to
depart
by
another
door
,
but
,
finding
it
locked
,
had
been
compelled
to
stay
against
his
will
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
painful
situation
to
be
placed
in
;
but
he
now
regretted
it
the
less
,
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
it
afforded
him
an
opportunity
of
acknowledging
,
before
their
mutual
friends
,
that
he
loved
Mr
Wardle
's
daughter
deeply
and
sincerely
;
that
he
was
proud
to
avow
that
the
feeling
was
mutual
;
and
that
if
thousands
of
miles
were
placed
between
them
,
or
oceans
rolled
their
waters
,
he
could
never
for
an
instant
forget
those
happy
days
,
when
first
---

<EOS>
Having
delivered
himself
to
this
effect
,
Mr
Snodgrass
bowed
again
,
looked
into
the
crown
of
his
hat
,
and
stepped
towards
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
shouted
Wardle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
in
the
name
of
all
that
's
---
"
   
"
Inflammable
,
"
mildly
suggested
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
thought
something
worse
was
coming
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
---
that
's
inflammable
,
"
said
Wardle
,
adopting
the
substitute
;
"
could
n't
you
say
all
this
to
me
in
the
first
instance
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Or
confide
in
me
?
"
added
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
,
"
said
Arabella
,
taking
up
the
defence
<EOS>
,
"
what
is
the
use
of
asking
all
that
now
,
especially
when
you
know
you
had
set
your
covetous
old
heart
on
a
richer
son
-
in
-
law
,
and
are
so
wild
and
fierce
besides
,
that
everybody
is
afraid
of
you
,
except
me
?
 
<EOS>
Shake
hands
with
him
,
and
order
him
some
dinner
,
for
goodness
gracious
"
sake
,
for
he
looks
half
starved
;
and
pray
have
your
wine
up
at
once
,
for
you
'll
not
be
tolerable
until
you
have
taken
two
bottles
at
least
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
worthy
old
gentleman
pulled
Arabella
's
ear
,
kissed
her
without
the
smallest
scruple
,
kissed
his
daughter
also
with
great
affection
,
and
shook
Mr
Snodgrass
warmly
by
the
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
right
on
one
point
at
all
events

said
the
old
gentleman
cheerfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ring
for
the
wine

<EOS>
The
wine
came
,
and
Perker
came
upstairs
at
the
same
moment
.
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
had
dinner
at
a
side
table
,
and
,
when
he
had
despatched
it
,
drew
his
chair
next
Emily
,
without
the
smallest
opposition
on
the
old
gentleman
's
part
.
   
<EOS>
The
evening
was
excellent
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Mr
Perker
came
out
wonderfully
,
told
various
comic
stories
,
and
sang
a
serious
song
which
was
almost
as
funny
as
the
anecdotes
.
 
<EOS>
Arabella
was
very
charming
,
<EOS>
Mr
Wardle
very
jovial
,
Mr
Pickwick
very
harmonious
,

Mr
Ben

very
uproarious

Mr

very
talkative

all

very
happy

<EOS>
With
this
figurative
illustration
of
his

,
Mr
Weller
unclasped
his
pocket

book
,
and
drew
forth
a
dirty
sheet
of
letter

paper
,
on
which
were
inscribed
various
characters
crowded
together
in
remarkable
confusion

laying

Sam
buttoned

replied
Mr

,
who
,
having
tied
his
shawl
with
the
aid
of
a
small
glass
that
hung
in
the
window
,
was
now
,
by
dint
of
the
most
wonderful
exertions
,
struggling
into
his
upper
garments
.
 
<EOS>
"

rejoined
his
son
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
think
so
now

said
Mr

,
with
the
gravity
of

<EOS>
As
Mr
Weller
delivered
this
infallible
maxim
---
the
result
of
many
years
"
personal
experience
and
observation
---
he
contrived
,
by
a
dexterous
twist
of
his
body
,
to
get
the
bottom
button
of
his
coat
to
perform
its
office
.
 
<EOS>
Having
paused
a
few
seconds
to
recover
breath
,
he
brushed
his
hat
with
his
elbow
,
and
declared
himself
ready
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
four
heads

Sammy
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
as
they
drove
along
the
London
Road
in
the
chaise
-
cart
,
"
and
as
all
this

is
a
wery
great
temptation

take

added
Mr
Weller
,
in
a
half
-
whisper
---
"
the

,
you
ever
<EOS>
know'd

<EOS>
"
   
"
And
of
a
lawyer
too

"
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
man
as
can
form
a
ackerate
judgment
of

can
form

"
replied
his
father
,
so
dogmatically
,
that
Sam
did
not
attempt
to
controvert
the
position
.
   
<EOS>
In
pursuance
of
this
notable
resolution
,
the
services
of
the
mottled
-
faced
gentleman
and
of
two
other
very
fat
coachmen
 
---
selected
by
Mr
Weller
,
probably
,
with
a
view
to
their
width
and
consequent
wisdom
---
were
put
into
requisition
;
and
this
assistance
having
been
secured
,
the
party
proceeded
to
the
public
-
house
in
Portugal
Street
,
whence
a
messenger
was
despatched
to
the
Insolvent
Court
over
the
way
,
requiring
Mr
Solomon
Pell
's
immediate
attendance
.
   
<EOS>
The
messenger
fortunately
found
Mr
Solomon
Pell
in
court
,
regaling
himself
,
business
being
rather
slack
,
with
a
cold
collation
of
an
Abernethy
biscuit
and
a
saveloy
.
 
<EOS>
The
message
was
no
sooner
whispered
in
his
ear
than
he
thrust
them
in
his
pocket
among
various
professional
documents
,
and
hurried
over
the
way
with
such
alacrity
that
he
reached
the
parlour
before
the
messenger
had
even
emancipated
himself
from
the
court
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
said
Mr
Pell
,
touching
his
hat
,
"
my
service
to
you
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
it
to
flatter
you
,
gentlemen
,
but
there
are
not
five
other
men
in
the
world

that
I
'd
have
come
out
of

court
for

day

<EOS>
"
So
busy

eh

"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Busy

"
<EOS>
replied
Pell
;
"
I
'm
completely
sewn
up
,
as
my
friend
the
late
Lord
Chancellor
many
a
time
used
to
say
to
me
,
gentlemen
,
when
he
came
out
from
hearing
appeals
in
the
House
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
;
he
was
very
susceptible
to
fatigue
;
he
used
to
feel
those
appeals
uncommonly
.
 
<EOS>
I
actually
thought
more
than
once
that
he
'd
have
sunk
under
'em
;
I
did
,
indeed

"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Pell
shook
his
head
and
paused
;
on
which
,
the
elder
Mr
Weller
,
nudging
his
neighbour
,
as
begging
him
to
mark
the
attorney
's
high
connections
,
asked
whether
the
duties
in
question
produced
any
permanent
ill
effects
on
the
constitution
of
his
noble
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
he
ever
quite
recovered
them

"
replied
Pell
;
"
<EOS>
in
fact
I
'm
sure
he
never
did

<EOS>
"
Pell
,
"
he
used
to
say
to
me
many
a
time
,
"
how
the
blazes
you
can
stand
the
head

work
you
do
,
is
a
mystery
to

---
"
Well

I
used
to
answer
,
"
I
hardly

do
it

upon

<EOS>
---
"
Pell
,
"
he
'd
add
,
sighing
,
and
looking
at
me
with
a
little
envy

friendly
envy

you

I

it

"
<EOS>
Pell
,
you
're
a
wonder
;
a
wonder
.
"
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
'd
have
liked
him
very
much
if
you
had
known
him
,
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
Bring
me
three
-
penn'orth
of
rum
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
Addressing
this
latter
remark
to
the
waitress
,
in
a
tone
of
subdued
grief
,
Mr
Pell
sighed
,
looked
at
his
shoes
and
the
ceiling
;
and
,
the
rum
having
by
that
time
arrived
,
drank
it
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
However
,
"
said
Pell
,
drawing
a
chair
to
the
table
,
"
a
professional
man
has
no
right
to
think
of
his
private
friendships
when
his
legal
assistance
is
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
bye
,
gentlemen
,
since
I
saw
you
here
before
,
we
have
had
to
weep
over
a
very
melancholy
occurrence
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pell
drew
out
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
when
he
came
to
the
word
weep
,
but
he
made
no
further
use
of
it
than
to
wipe
away
a
slight
tinge
of
rum
which
hung
upon
his
upper
lip
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
saw
it
in
the
ADVERTISER
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
continued
Pell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
soul
,
not
more
than
fifty
-
two

<EOS>
Dear
me
---
only
think

"
   
<EOS>
These
indications
of
a
musing
spirit
were
addressed
to
the
mottled
-
faced
man
,
whose
eyes
Mr
Pell
had
accidentally
caught
;
on
which
,
the
mottled
-
faced
man
,
whose
apprehension
of
matters
in
general
was
of
a
foggy
nature
,
moved
uneasily
in
his
seat
,
and
opined
that
,
indeed
,
so
far
as
that
went
,
there
was
no
saying
how
things
was
brought
about
;
which
observation
,
involving
one
of
those
subtle
propositions
which
it
is
difficult
to
encounter
in
argument
,
was
controverted
by
nobody
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
it
remarked
that
she
was
a
very
fine
woman
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
Pell
,
in
a
sympathising
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
she
wos
,
"
replied
the
elder
Mr
Weller
,
not
much
relishing
this
mode
of
discussing
the
subject
,
and
yet
thinking
that
the
attorney
,
from
his
long
intimacy
with
the
late
Lord
Chancellor
,
must
know
best
on
all
matters
of
polite
breeding
.
"
<EOS>
She
wos
a
wery
fine
"
ooman
,
sir
,
ven
<EOS>
I
first
know'd
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
wos
a
widder
,
sir
,
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
it
's
curious
,
"
said
Pell
,
looking
round
with
a
sorrowful
smile
;
"
Mrs
Pell
was
a
widow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
very
extraordinary
,
"
said
the
mottled
-
faced
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
it
is
a
curious
coincidence
,
"
said
Pell
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
gruffly
remarked
the
elder
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
More
widders
is
married
than
single
wimin

"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
very
good
,
"
said
Pell
,
"
you
're
quite
right
,
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Pell
was
a
very
elegant
and
accomplished
woman
;
her
manners
were
the
theme
of
universal
admiration
in
our
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
proud
to
see
that
woman
dance
;
there
was
something
so
firm
and
dignified
,
and
yet
natural
,
in
her
motion
.
<EOS>
Her
cutting
,
gentlemen
,
was
simplicity
itself
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
well
,
well
!
<EOS>
Excuse
my
asking
the
question
<EOS>
,
Mr
Samuel
,
"
continued
the
attorney
in
a
lower
voice
,
"
was
your
mother
-
in
-
law
tall
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
wery
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Pell
was
a
tall
figure
,
"
said
Pell
,
"
a
splendid
woman
,
with
a
noble
shape
,
and
a
nose
,
gentlemen
,
formed
to
command
and
be
majestic
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
very
much
attached
to
me
---
very
much
---
highly
connected
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mother
's
brother

,
failed
for
eight
hundred
pounds
,
as
a
law
stationer
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
who
had
grown
rather
restless
during
this
discussion
,
"
vith
regard
to
bis'ness
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
word
was
music
to
Pell
's
ears
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
revolving
in
his
mind
whether
any
business
was
to
be
transacted
,
or
whether
he
had
been
merely
invited
to
partake
of
a
glass
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
or
a
bowl
of
punch
,
or
any
similar
professional
compliment
,
and
now
the
doubt
was
set
at
rest
without
his
appearing
at
all
eager
for
its
solution
.
 
<EOS>
His
eyes
glistened
as
he
laid
his
hat
on
the
table
,
and
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
business
upon
which
---
um
?
 
<EOS>
Either
of
these
gentlemen
wish

<EOS>
We

a

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Give
me
the
dockyment
,
Sammy
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
taking
the
will
from
his
son
,
who
appeared
to
enjoy
the
interview
amazingly
.
<EOS>
"
Wot

said
Pell
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well

replied
Mr
Weller
sharply
,
"
probe

probe

<EOS>
"
No

"
said
Pell
meekly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You

"
he
added
,
casting
his
eyes
over
the
paper
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
These
other
gentlemen
,
I
presume
,
are
legatees
,
are
they
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Pell
,
with
a
congratulatory
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sammy
is
a
leg
-
at
-
ease
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
;
"
these
other
gen'l'm'n
is
friends

mine

just
come
to
see
fair
;
a
kind
of
umpires
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Pell
,
"
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
objections
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
want
a
matter
of
five
pound
of
you
before
I
begin
,
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
being
decided
by
the
committee
that
the
five
pound
might
be
advanced
,
Mr
Weller
produced
that
sum
;
after
which
,
a
long
consultation
about
nothing
particular
took
place
,
in
the
course
whereof
Mr
Pell
demonstrated
to
the
perfect
satisfaction
of
the
gentlemen
who
saw
fair
,
that
unless
the
management
of
the
business
had
been
intrusted
to
him
,
it
must
all
have
gone
wrong
,
for
reasons
not
clearly
made
out
,
but
no
doubt
sufficient
.
 
<EOS>
This
important
point
being
despatched
,
Mr
Pell
refreshed
himself
with
three
chops
,
and
liquids
both
malt
and
spirituous
,
at
the
expense
of
the
estate
;
and
then
they
all
went
away
to
Doctors
"
Commons
.
   
<EOS>
The
next
day
there
was
another
visit
to
Doctors
"
Commons
,
and
a
great
to
-
do
with
an
attesting
hostler
,
who
,
being
inebriated
,
declined
swearing
anything
but
profane
oaths
,
to
the
great
scandal
of
a
proctor
and
surrogate
.
 
<EOS>
Next
week
,
there
were
more
visits
to
Doctors
"
Commons
,
and
there
was
a
visit
to
the
Legacy
Duty
Office
besides
,
and
there
were
treaties
entered
into
,
for
the
disposal
of
the
lease
and
business
,
and
ratifications
of
the
same
,
and
inventories
to
be
made
out
,
and
lunches
to
be
taken
,
and
dinners
to
be
eaten
,
and
so
many
profitable
things
to
be
done
,
and
such
a
mass
of
papers
accumulated
that
Mr
Solomon
Pell
,
and
the
boy
,
and
the
blue
bag
to
boot
,
all
got
so
stout
that
scarcely
anybody
would
have
known
them
for
the
same
man
,
boy
,
and
bag
,
that
had
loitered
about
Portugal
Street
,
a
few
days
before
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
all
these
weighty
matters
being
arranged
,
a
day
was
fixed
for
selling
out
and
transferring
the
stock
,
and
of
waiting
with
that
view
upon
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
,
stock
-
broker
,
of
somewhere
near
the
bank
,
who
had
been
recommended
by
Mr
Solomon
Pell
for
the
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
kind
of
festive
occasion
,
and
the
parties
were
attired
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
's
tops
were
newly
cleaned
,
and
his
dress
was
arranged
with
peculiar
care
;
the
mottled
-
faced
gentleman
wore
at
his
button
-
hole
a
full
-
sized
dahlia
with
several
leaves
;
and
the
coats
of
his
two
friends
were
adorned
with
nosegays
of
laurel
and
other
evergreens
.
 
<EOS>
All
three
were
habited
in
strict
holiday
costume
;
that
is
to
say
,
they
were
wrapped
up
to
the
chins
,
and
wore
as
many
clothes
as
possible
,
which
is
,
and
has
been
,
a
stage
-
coachman
's
idea
of
full
dress
ever
since
stage
-
coaches
were
invented
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pell
was
waiting
at
the
usual
place
of
meeting
at
the
appointed
time
;
even
he
wore
a
pair
of
gloves
and
a
clean
shirt
,
much
frayed
at
the
collar
and
wristbands
by
frequent
washings
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
quarter
to
two
,
"
said
Pell
,
looking
at
the
parlour
clock
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
we
are
with
Mr
Flasher
at
a
quarter
past
,
we
shall
just
hit
the
best
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
should
you
say
to
a
drop
o
'
beer
,
gen'l'm'n
?
"
suggested
the
mottled
-
faced
man
.
"
<EOS>
And
a
little
bit
o
'
cold
beef
,
"
said
the
second
coachman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Or
a
oyster
,
"
added
the
third
,
who
was
a
hoarse
gentleman
,
supported
by
very
round
legs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hear
,
hear
!
"
<EOS>
said
Pell
;
"
to
congratulate
Mr
Weller
,
on
his
coming
into
possession
of
his
property
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
quite
agreeable
,
gen'l'm'n

"
answered
Mr
Weller
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sammy
,
pull
the
bell
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sammy
complied
;
and
the
porter
,
cold
beef
,
and
oysters
being
promptly
produced
,
the
lunch
was
done
ample
justice
to
.
 
<EOS>
Where
everybody
took
so
active
a
part
,
it
is
almost
invidious
to
make
a
distinction
;
but
if
one
individual
evinced
greater
powers
than
another
,
it
was
the
coachman
with
the
hoarse
voice
,
who
took
an
imperial
pint
of
vinegar
with
his
oysters
,
without
betraying
the
least
emotion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pell
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
elder
Mr
Weller
,
stirring
a
glass
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
of
which
one
was
placed
before
every
gentleman
when
the
oyster
shells
were
removed
---
"
Mr
Pell
,
Sir
<EOS>
,
it
wos
my
intention
to
have
proposed
the
funs
on
this
occasion

but
Samivel
has
vispered
to
me
---
"
   
Here
<EOS>
Mr
Samuel
Weller
,
who
had
silently
eaten
his
oysters
with
tranquil
smiles
,
cried
,
"
Hear
!
"
<EOS>
in
a
very
loud
voice
.
    
<EOS>
---
"
Has
vispered
to
me
,
"
resumed
his
father
,
"
that
it
vould
be
better
to
dewote
the
liquor
to
vishin
'
you
success
and
prosperity
,
and
thankin

you
for
the
manner

Here

health

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
hard
there
,

interposed
the
mottled
-
faced
gentleman
,
with
sudden
energy
;
"
your
eyes
on
me
,
gen'l'm'n
!
"
   
<EOS>
Saying
this
,
the
mottled
-
faced
gentleman
rose
,
as
did
the
other
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
The
mottled
-
faced
gentleman
reviewed
the
company
,
and
slowly
lifted
his
hand
,
upon
which
every
man
(
including
him
of
the
mottled
countenance
)
drew
a
long
breath
,
and
lifted
his
tumbler
to
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
instant
,
the
mottled
-
faced
gentleman
depressed
his
hand
again
,
and
every
glass
was
set
down
empty
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
describe
the
thrilling
effect
produced
by
this
striking
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
At
once
dignified
,
solemn
,
and
impressive
,
it
combined
every
element
of
grandeur
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Mr
Pell
,
"
all
I
can
say
is
,
that
such
marks
of
confidence
must
be
very
gratifying
to
a
professional
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wish
to
say
anything
that
might
appear
egotistical
,
gentlemen
,
but
I
'm
very
glad
,
for
your
own
sakes
,
that
you
came
to
me
;
that
's
all
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
had
gone
to
any
low
member
of
the
profession
,
it
's
my
firm
conviction
,
and
I
assure
you
of
it
as
a
fact
,
that
you
would
have
found
yourselves
in
Queer
Street
before
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
wished
my
noble
friend
had
been
alive
to
have
seen
my
management
of
this
case
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
it
out
of
pride

<EOS>
I
think

<EOS>
However

gentlemen

I
wo
n't
trouble
you
with
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
generally
to
be
found
here

gentlemen

if
I
'm
not
here
,
or
over
the
way

that
's
my
address

<EOS>
You
'll
find
my
terms
very
cheap
and
reasonable
,
and
no
man
attends
more
to
his
clients
than
I
do
,
and
<EOS>
I
hope
I
know
a
little
of
my
profession
besides
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
opportunity
of
recommending
me
to
any
of
your
friends
,
gentlemen
,
I
shall
be
very
much
obliged
to
you

so
will

Your

<EOS>
With
this
expression
of
his
feelings
,
Mr
Solomon
Pell
laid
three
small
written
cards
before
Mr
Weller
's
friends
,
and
,
looking
at
the
clock
again
,
feared
it
was
time
to
be
walking
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
hint
Mr
Weller
settled
the
bill
,
and
,
issuing
forth
,
the
executor
,
legatee
,
attorney
,
and
umpires
,
directed
their
steps
towards
the

<EOS>
The
office
of
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
,
of
the
Stock
Exchange
,
was
in
a
first
floor
up
a
court
behind
the
Bank
of
England
;
the
house
of
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
,
was
at
Brixton
,
Surrey
;
the
horse
and
stanhope
of
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
,
were
at
an
adjacent
livery
stable
;
the
groom
of
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
,
was
on
his
way
to
the
West
End
to
deliver
some
game
;
the
clerk
of
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
,
had
gone
to
his
dinner
;
and
so
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
,
himself
,
cried
,
"
Come
in
,
"
when
Mr
Pell
and
his
companions
knocked
at
the
counting
-
house
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
morning
,
Sir
,
"
said
Pell
,
bowing
obsequiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
want
to
make
a
little
transfer
,
if
you
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
just
come
in
,
will
you
?
"
said
Mr
Flasher
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
a
minute
;
I
'll
attend
to
you
directly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Sir
,
"
said
Pell
,
"
there
's
no
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
Take
a
chair
,
Mr
Weller
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
took
a
chair
,
and
Sam
took
a
box
,
and
the
umpires
took
what
they
could
get
,
and
looked
at
the
almanac
and
one
or
two
papers
which
were
wafered
against
the
wall
,
with
as
much
open
-
eyed
reverence
as
if
they
had
been
the
finest
efforts
of
the
old
masters
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'll
bet
you
half
a
dozen
of
claret
on
it
;
come
!
"
said
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
,
resuming
the
conversation
to
which
Mr
Pell
's
entrance
had
caused
a
momentary
interruption
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
addressed
to
a
very
smart
young
gentleman
who
wore
his
hat
on
his
right
whisker
,
and
was
lounging
over
the
desk
,
killing
flies
with
a
ruler
.
 
<EOS>
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
,
was
balancing
himself
on
two
legs
of
an
office
stool
,
spearing
a
wafer
-
box
with
a
penknife
,
which
he
dropped
every
now
and
then
with
great
dexterity
into
the
very
centre
of
a
small
red
wafer
that
was
stuck
outside
.
 
<EOS>
Both
gentlemen
had
very
open
waistcoats
and
very
rolling
collars
,
and
very
small
boots
,
and
very
big
rings
,
and
very
little
watches
,
and
very
large
guard
-
chains
,
and
symmetrical
inexpressibles
,
and
scented
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
bet
half
a
dozen

"
said
the
other
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
a
dozen
.

<EOS>
"
Done

Esquire

<EOS>
"
P

"
observed
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
replied
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
.
 
<EOS>
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
,
entered
it
in
a
little
book
,
with
a
gold
pencil
-
case
,
and
the
other
gentleman
entered
it
also
,
in
another
little
book
with
another
gold
pencil
-
case
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
there
's
a
notice
up
this
morning
about
Boffer
,
"
observed
Mr
Simmery
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
devil
,
he
's
expelled
the
house
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll

ten

said
Wilkins
Flasher

Esquire
.
   
<EOS>
"
Done

replied
Mr

.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop

<EOS>
I

"
said
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
,
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
may
hang
himself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Simmery
,
pulling
out
the
gold
pencil
-
case
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
no
objection
to
take
you
that

<EOS>
Say

"
   
<EOS>
"
Kills

,
in

"
said
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
.
   
<EOS>
"
Just
so
,
"
replied
Mr
Simmery
,
putting
it
down
.
 
<EOS>
"
"
Flasher
---
ten
guineas
to
five
,
Boffer
kills
himself
.
"
 
<EOS>
Within
what
time
shall
we
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
fortnight
?
"
suggested
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
.
   
<EOS>
"
Con
-
found
it
,
no
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Simmery
,
stopping
for
an
instant
to
smash
a
fly
with
the
ruler
.
 
<EOS>
"
Say
a
week
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Split
the

"
said
Wilkins
Flasher

Esquire

<EOS>
"
Make
it
ten
days
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
;
ten
days
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Simmery
.
   
<EOS>
So
it
was
entered
down
on
the
little
books
that
Boffer
was
to
kill
himself
within
ten
days
,
or
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
,
was
to
hand
over
to
Frank
Simmery
,
Esquire
,
the
sum
of
ten
guineas
;
and
that
if
Boffer
did
kill
himself
within
that
time
,
Frank
Simmery
,
Esquire
,
would
pay
to
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
,
five
guineas
,
instead
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
sorry
he
has
failed
,
"
said
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Capital
dinners
he
gave
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fine
port
he
had
too
,
"
remarked
Mr
Simmery
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
going
to
send
our
butler
to
the
sale
to

morrow

to
pick
up
some

"
   
<EOS>
"
The

said
Wilkins
Flasher

Esquire

<EOS>
"
My

<EOS>
Five

<EOS>

Done

<EOS>
Another
entry
was
made
in
the
little
books
,
with
the
gold
pencil
-
cases
;
and
Mr
Simmery
,
having
by
this
time
killed
all
the
flies
and
taken
all
the
bets
,
strolled
away
to
the
Stock
Exchange
to
see
what
was
going
forward
.
   
<EOS>
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
,
now
condescended
to
receive
Mr
Solomon
Pell
's
instructions
,
and
having
filled
up
some
printed
forms
,
requested
the
party
to
follow
him
to
the
bank
,
which
they
did
:
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
and
his
three
friends
staring
at
all
they
beheld
in
unbounded
astonishment
,
and
Sam
encountering
everything
with
a
coolness
which
nothing
could
disturb
.
   
<EOS>
Crossing
a
courtyard
which
was
all
noise
and
bustle
,
and
passing
a
couple
of
porters
who
seemed
dressed
to
match
the
red
fire
engine
which
was
wheeled
away
into
a
corner
,
they
passed
into
an
office
where
their
business
was
to
be
transacted
,
and
where
Pell
and
Mr
Flasher
left
them
standing
for
a
few
moments
,
while
they
went
upstairs
into
the
Will
Office
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wot
place

"
whispered
the
mottled
-
faced
gentleman
to
the
elder
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Counsel

Office

"
replied
the
executor
in
a
whisper
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot

asked

hoarse
coachman

<EOS>
"
Reduced

replied
Mr

"
<EOS>
inquired
Sam
,
with
some
disdain
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
know
?
"
retorted
Mr
Weller
;
"
I
thought
they
looked
wery
like

<EOS>
Wot

"
   
<EOS>

inquired
his

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
'Cos

replied
Sam

"
it

"
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
and
his
friends
had
scarcely
had
a
moment
to
reflect
upon
this
singular
regulation
as
connected
with
the
monetary
system
of
the
country
,
when
they
were
rejoined
by
Pell
and
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
,
who
led
them
to
a
part
of
the
counter
above
which
was
a
round
blackboard
with
a
large
"
W^
"
on
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
's
that
for

Sir

"
inquired
Mr
Weller
,
directing
Pell
's
attention
to
the
target
in
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
first
letter
of
the
name
of
the
deceased

"
replied
Pell
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
turning
round
to
the
umpires
,
there
's
somethin'
wrong
here
.
 
<EOS>
We
's
our
letter
---
this
wo
n't
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
referees
at
once
gave
it
as
their
decided
opinion
that
the
business
could
not
be
legally
proceeded
with
,
under
the
letter
W^
,
and
in
all
probability
it
would
have
stood
over
for
one
day
at
least
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
prompt
,
though
,
at
first
sight
,
undutiful
behaviour
of
Sam
,
who
,
seizing
his
father
by
the
skirt
of
the
coat
,
dragged
him
to
the
counter
,
and
pinned
him
there
,
until
he
had
affixed
his
signature
to
a
couple
of
instruments
;
which
,
from
Mr
Weller
's
habit
of
printing
,
was
a
work
of
so
much
labour
and
time
,
that
the
officiating
clerk
peeled
and
ate
three
Ribstone
pippins
while
it
was
performing
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
elder
Mr
Weller
insisted
on
selling
out
his
portion
forthwith
,
they
proceeded
from
the
bank
to
the
gate
of
the
Stock
Exchange
,
to
which
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
,
after
a
short
absence
,
returned
with
a
cheque
on
Smith
,
Payne
,
&
Smith
,
for
five
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
;
that
being
the
money
to
which
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
,
at
the
market
price
of
the
day
,
was
entitled
,
in
consideration
of
the
balance
of
the
second
Mrs
Weller
's
funded
savings
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
's
two
hundred
pounds
stood
transferred
to
his
name
,
and
Wilkins
Flasher
,
Esquire
,
having
been
paid
his
commission
,
dropped
the
money
carelessly
into
his
coat
pocket
,
and
lounged
back
to
his
office
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
was
at
first
obstinately
determined
on
cashing
the
cheque
in
nothing
but
sovereigns
;
but
it
being
represented
by
the
umpires
that
by
so
doing
he
must
incur
the
expense
of
a
small
sack
to
carry
them
home
in
,
he
consented
to
receive
the
amount
in
five
-
pound
notes
.

"

Mr

,

they
came
out

A
quiet
room
was
soon
found
,
and
the
accounts
were
produced
and
audited
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pell
's
bill
was
taxed
by
Sam
,
and
some
charges
were
disallowed
by
the
umpires
;
but
,
notwithstanding
Mr
Pell
's
declaration
,
accompanied
with
many
solemn
asseverations
that
they
were
really
too
hard
upon
him
,
it
was
by
very
many
degrees
the
best
professional
job
he
had
ever
had
,
and
one
on
which
he
boarded
,
lodged
,
and
washed
,
for
six
months
afterwards

The
umpires
having
partaken
of
a
dram
,
shook
hands
and
departed
,
as
they
had
to
drive
out
of
town
that
night

Mr
Solomon
Pell
,
finding
that
nothing
more
was
going
forward
,
either
in
the
eating
or
drinking
way

took
a
friendly
leave

and
Sam

his
father
were
left
alone

Chapter
56
.
<EOS>
An
important
conference
takes
place
between
Mr
Pickwick
and
Samuel
Weller
,
at
which
his
parent
assists
---
an
old
gentleman
in
a
snuff
-
coloured
suit
<EOS>
arrives
unexpectedly
 
Mr
Pickwick
was
sitting
alone
,
musing
over
many
things
,
and
thinking
among
other
considerations
how
he
could
best
provide
for
the
young
couple
whose
present
unsettled
condition
was
matter
of
constant
regret
and
anxiety
to
him
,
when
Mary
stepped
lightly
into
the
room
,
and
,
advancing
to
the
table
,
said
,
rather
hastily
---
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
if
you
please
,
Sir
,
Samuel
is
downstairs
,
and
he
says
may
his
father
see
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mary
,
tripping
towards
the
door
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
has
not
been
here
long
,
has
he
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mary
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
only
just
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
going
to
ask
you
for
any
more
leave
,
Sir
,
he
says
.
<EOS>
"
   
Mary
might
have
been
conscious
that
she
had
communicated
this
last
intelligence
with
more
warmth
than
seemed
actually
necessary
,
or
she
might
have
observed
the
good
-
humoured
smile
with
which
Mr
Pickwick
regarded
her
,
when
she
had
finished
speaking
.
 
<EOS>
She
certainly
held
down
her
head
,
and
examined
the
corner
of
a
very
smart
little
apron
,
with
more
closeness
than
there
appeared
any
absolute
occasion
for
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
them
they
can
come
up
at
once
,
by
all
means
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
Mary
,
apparently
much
relieved
,
hurried
away
with
her
message
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
took
two
or
three
turns
up
and
down
the
room
;
and
,
rubbing
his
chin
with
his
left
hand
as
he
did
so
,
appeared
lost
in
thought
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
at
length
in
a
kind
but
somewhat
melancholy
tone
,
"
<EOS>
it
is
the
best
way
in
which
I
could
reward
him
for
his
attachment
and
fidelity
;
let
it
be
so
,
in
Heaven
's
name
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
fate
of
a
lonely
old
man
,
that
those
about
him
should
form
new
and
different
attachments
and
leave
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
expect
that
it
should
be
otherwise
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
"
added
Mr
Pickwick
more
cheerfully
,
"
it
would
be
selfish
and
ungrateful
.
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
be
happy
to
have
an
opportunity
of
providing
for
him
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
I
am

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
had
been
so
absorbed
in
these
reflections
,
that
a
knock
at
the
door
was
three
or
four
times
repeated
before
he
heard
it
.
 
<EOS>
Hastily
seating
himself
,
and
calling
up
his
accustomed
pleasant
looks
,
he
gave
the
required
permission
,
and
Sam
Weller
entered
,
followed
by
his
father
.
   
<EOS>
"
Glad
to
see
you
back
again
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
How

"
   
<EOS>
"
Wery

the

;

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite

replied
Mr

<EOS>
"
I

Mr

<EOS>
"

"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee

I

said
Mr
Weller
,
bringing
one
forward
as
he
spoke
;
"
uncommon
fine
day
it
's
been
,
sir
,
"
added
the
old
gentleman
,
laying
his
hat
on
the
floor
as
he
sat
himself
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
Remarkably

Mr

<EOS>

Very

<EOS>
"
Seasonablest

rejoined
Mr
Weller
.
<EOS>
Here
,
the
old
gentleman
was
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
,
which
,
being
terminated
,
he
nodded
his
head
and
winked
and
made
several
supplicatory
and
threatening
gestures
to
his
son
,
all
of
which
Sam
Weller
steadily
abstained
from
seeing
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
perceiving
that
there
was
some
embarrassment
on
the
old
gentleman
's
part
,
affected
to
be
engaged
in
cutting
the
leaves
of
a
book
that
lay
beside
him
,
and
waited
patiently
until
Mr
Weller
should
arrive
at
the
object
of
his
visit
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never

said
Mr

looking
indignantly
at
his

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What

inquired
Mr

<EOS>
"
He

<EOS>

with

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
nodded
his
head
an
extraordinary
number
of
times
,
in
the
excess
of
his
gratification
,
and
waited
in
a
listening
attitude
for
Sam
to
resume
his
statement
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
sit
down
,
Sam

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
apprehending
that
the
interview
was
likely
to
prove
rather
longer
than
he
had
expected
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
bowed
again
and
sat
down
;
his
father
looking
round
,
he
continued
---
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

in

walking
up

whispering
in

"
 
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
Mr
Weller
placed
the
pocket
-
book
in
Mr
Pickwick
's
hands
,
caught
up
his
hat
,
and
ran
out
of
the
room
with
a
celerity
scarcely
to
be
expected
from
so
corpulent
a
subject
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop

Sam

"
exclaimed
Mr

earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Overtake

<EOS>
Mr

---

"
   
<EOS>
Sam
saw
that
his
master
's
injunctions
were
not
to
be
disobeyed
;
and
,
catching
his
father
by
the
arm
as
he
was
descending
the
stairs
,
dragged
him
back
by
main
force
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
taking
the
old
man
by
the
hand
,
"

confidence
overpowers

"
   
<EOS>
"
I

replied
Mr

obstinately
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you

said
Mr

.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No

knows
how
much
he
can
spend

till

tries
,
"
observed
Mr
Weller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
but
as
I
have
no
intention
of
trying
any
such
experiments
,
I
am
not
likely
to
come
to
want

<EOS>
I
must
beg
you
to
take
this
back
,
Mr
Weller
.
"
<EOS>
"
Wery

said
Mr
Weller
,
with
a
discontented
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mark
my

<EOS>

I
'll

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
not

"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
reflected
for
a
short
time
,
and
then
,
buttoning
up
his
coat
with
great
determination
,
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
keep
a
pike
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
!
"
exclaimed
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
pike
!
"
rejoined
Mr
Weller
,
through
his
set
teeth
;
"
I
'll
keep
a
pike
.
 
<EOS>
Say
good

bye
to
your

,
Samivel
.
 
<EOS>
I
dewote
the
remainder
of
my
days
to

"
   
<EOS>
This
threat
was
such
an
awful
one
,
and
Mr
Weller
,
besides
appearing
fully
resolved
to
carry
it
into
execution
,
seemed
so
deeply
mortified
by
Mr
Pickwick
's
refusal
,
that
that
gentleman
,
after
a
short
reflection
,
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
Mr
Weller
,
I
will
keep
your
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
do
more

perhaps
,
than
you

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
the
wery
thing
,
to
be

"
said
Mr
Weller
,
brightening
up
;
"
o
'
course
you
can
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Say
no
more
about
it
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
locking
the
pocket
-
book
in
his
desk
;
"
I
am
heartily
obliged
to
you
,
my
good

<EOS>
Now
sit
down
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
ask
your
advice
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
internal
laughter
occasioned
by
the
triumphant
success
of
his
visit
,
which
had
convulsed
not
only
Mr
Weller
's
face
,
but
his
arms
,
legs
,
and
body
also
,
during
the
locking
up
of
the
pocket
-
book
,
suddenly
gave
place
to
the
most
dignified
gravity
as
he
heard
these
words
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wait
outside
a
few
minutes
,
Sam
,
will
you
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
immediately
withdrew
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
looked
uncommonly
wise
and
very
much
amazed
,
when
Mr
Pickwick
opened
the
discourse
by
saying
---
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
an
advocate
for
matrimony
,
I
think
,
Mr
Weller
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
shook
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
wholly
unable
to
speak
;
vague
thoughts
of
some
wicked
widow
having
been
successful
in
her
designs
on
Mr
Pickwick
,
choked
his
utterance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
happen
to
see
a
young
girl
downstairs
when
you
came
in
just
now
with
your
son
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
a
young
gal
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
shortly
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
think
of
her
,
now
?
 
<EOS>
Candidly
,
Mr
Weller
,
what
did
you
think
of
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
she
wos
wery
plump
,
and
vell
made
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
with
a
critical
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
she
is
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
<EOS>
so
she
is
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
you
think
of
her
manners
,
from
what
you
saw
of
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
pleasant
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wery
pleasant
and
comformable
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
precise
meaning
which
Mr
Weller
attached
to
this
last
-
mentioned
adjective
,
did
not
appear
;
but
,
as
it
was
evident
from
the
tone
in
which
he
used
it
that
it
was
a
favourable
expression
,
Mr
Pickwick
was
as
well
satisfied
as
if
he
had
been
thoroughly
enlightened
on
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
take
a
great
interest
in
her
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
coughed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
an
interest
in
her
doing
well
,
"
resumed
Mr
Pickwick
;
"
a
desire
that
she
may
be
comfortable
and
prosperous
.
 
<EOS>
You
understand
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
clearly
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
,
who
understood
nothing
yet
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
young

Mr

<EOS>
"
Wery

responded
Mr

You

"
observed
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
but
I
had
better
do
so
at
once
.
<EOS>
This
young
person
is
not
only
attached
to
your
son
,
Mr
Weller
,
but
your
son
is
attached
to
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
"
this
<EOS>
here
's
a
pretty
sort
<EOS>
o
'
thing
to
come
to
a
father
's
ears
,
this
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
observed
them
on
several
occasions
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
making
no
comment
on
Mr
Weller
's
last
remark
;
"
and
entertain
no
doubt
at
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Supposing
<EOS>
I
were
desirous
of
establishing
them
comfortably
as
man
and
wife
in
some
little
business
or
situation
,
where
they
might
hope
to
obtain
a
decent
living
<EOS>
,
what
should
you
think
of
it
,
Mr
Weller
?
"
   
<EOS>
At
first
,
Mr
Weller
received
with
wry
faces
a
proposition
involving
the
marriage
of
anybody
in
whom
he
took
an
interest
;
but
,
as
Mr
Pickwick
argued
the
point
with
him
,
and
laid
great
stress
on
the
fact
that
Mary
was
not
a
widow
,
he
gradually
became
more
tractable
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
had
great
influence
over
him
,
and
he
had
been
much
struck
with
Mary
's
appearance
;
having
,
in
fact
,
bestowed
several
very
unfatherly
winks
upon
her
,
already
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
said
that
it
was
not
for
him
to
oppose
Mr
Pickwick
's
inclination
,
and
that
he
would
be
very
happy
to
yield
to
his
advice
;
upon
which
,
Mr
Pickwick
joyfully
took
him
at
his
word
,
and
called
Sam
back
into
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
clearing
his
throat
,
"
your
father
<EOS>
and
I
have
been
having
some
conversation
about
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
About
you
,
Samivel
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
in
a
patronising
and
impressive
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
so
blind
,
Sam
,
as
not
to
have
seen
,
a
long
time
since
,
that
you
entertain
something
more
than
a
friendly
feeling
towards
Mrs
Winkle
's
maid
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
hear
this
,
Samivel
?
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
in
the
same
judicial
form
of
speech
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Sir
,
"
said
Sam
,
addressing
his
master
,
"
I
hope
there
's
no
harm
in
a
young
man
takin
'
notice
of
a
young
"
ooman
as
is
undeniably
good
-
looking
and
well
-
conducted
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
by
no
means
,
"
acquiesced
Mr
Weller
,
affably
but
magisterially
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
far
from
thinking
there
is
anything
wrong
in
conduct
so
natural
,
"
resumed
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
it
is
my
wish
to
assist
and
promote
your
wishes
in
this
respect
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
I
have
had
a
little
conversation
with
your
father
;
and
finding
that
he
is
of
my
opinion
---
"
   
"
The
lady
not
bein
'
a
widder
,
"
interposed
Mr
Weller
in
explanation
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
lady
not
being
a
widow
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
free
you
from
the
restraint
which
your
present
position
imposes
upon
you
,
and
to
mark
my
sense
of
your
fidelity
and
many
excellent
qualities
,
by
enabling
you
to
marry
this
girl
at
once
,
and
to
earn
an
independent
livelihood
for
yourself
and
family
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
proud
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
whose
voice
had
faltered
a
little
hitherto
,
but
now
resumed
its
customary
tone
,
"
proud
and
happy
to
make
your
future
prospects
in
life
my
grateful
and
peculiar
care
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
profound
silence
for
a
short
time
,
and
then
Sam
said
,
in
a
low
,
husky
sort
of
voice
,
but
firmly
withal
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
goodness
,
Sir
,
as
is
only
like
yourself

but
it
ca
n't
be
done

"
   
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
be
done

"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mr
Pickwick
in
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Samivel

"
said
Mr
Weller
,
with
dignity
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
it
ca
n't
be
done
,
"
repeated
Sam
in
a
louder
key
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wot
's
to
become
of
you
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
good
fellow
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
<EOS>
the
recent
changes
among
my
friends
will
alter
my
mode
of
life
in
future
,
entirely
;
besides
,
I
am
growing
older
,
and
want
repose
and
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
My

Sam
,
are
over

"
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
I
know
that
'
ere
,

?
"
argued
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>

"
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
good
,
Samivel
,
there
's
a
good
deal
in
that
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
encouragingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
speak
after
long
deliberation
,
Sam
,
and
with
the
certainty
that
I
shall
keep
my
word
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
New
scenes
have
closed
upon
me
;
my
rambles
are
at
an
end
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
good
,
"
rejoined
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
that
's
the
wery
best
reason

<EOS>
you
should
alvays
have
somebody

Sam

"
   
<EOS>
At
the
close
of
this
declaration
,
which
Sam
made
with
great
emotion
,
the
elder
Mr
Weller
rose
from
his
chair
,
and
,
forgetting
all
considerations
of
time
,
place
,
or
propriety
,
waved
his
hat
above
his
head
,
and
gave
three
vehement
cheers
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
good
fellow
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
when
Mr
Weller
had
sat
down
again
,
rather
abashed
at
his
own
enthusiasm
,
"
you
are
bound
to
consider
the
young
woman
also
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
consider
the
young
"
ooman
,
Sir
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
considered
the
young
"
ooman
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
spoke
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
told
her
how
I
'm
sitivated
;
she
's
ready

vait

I
'm
ready

and
I
believe
she
vill
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
do
n't
,
she
's
not
the
young
"
ooman
I
take
her
for
,
and
I
give
her
up
<EOS>
vith
readiness
.
 
<EOS>
You
've
<EOS>
know'd
<EOS>
me
afore
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
My
mind
's
made
up
,
and
nothin'
can
ever
alter
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Who
could
combat
this
resolution
?
 
<EOS>
Not
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
He
derived
,
at
that
moment
,
more
pride
and
luxury
of
feeling
from
the
disinterested
attachment
of
his
humble
friends
,
<EOS>
than
ten
thousand
protestations
from
the
greatest
men
living
could
have
awakened
in
his
heart
.
   
<EOS>
While
this
conversation
was
passing
in
Mr
Pickwick
's
room
,
a
little
old
gentleman
in
a
suit
of
snuff
-
coloured
clothes
,
followed
by
a
porter
carrying
a
small
portmanteau
,
presented
himself
below
;
and
,
after
securing
a
bed
for
the
night
,
inquired
of
the
waiter
whether
one
Mrs
Winkle
was
staying
there
,
to
which
question
the
waiter
of
course
responded
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
she
alone
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
she
is
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
waiter
;
"
I
can
call
her
own
maid
,
Sir
,
if
you
---
"
   
"
No
,
I
do
n't
want
her
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Show
me
to
her
room
without
announcing
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
Sir
?
"
said
the
waiter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
deaf
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
little
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
listen
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
hear
me
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
.
 
<EOS>
Show
me
to
Mrs
Winkle
's
room
,
without
announcing
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
little
old
gentleman
uttered
this
command
,
he
slipped
five
shillings
into
the
waiter
's
hand
,
and
looked
steadily
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
sir
,
"
said
the
waiter
,
"
I
do
n't
know
,
sir
,
whether
---
"
   
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
'll
do
it
<EOS>
,
I
see
,
"
said
the
little
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
do
it
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
save
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
very
cool
and
collected
in
the
gentleman
's
manner
,
that
the
waiter
put
the
five
shillings
in
his
pocket
,
and
led
him
upstairs
without
another
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
room
,
is
it
?
"
said
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
go
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
waiter
complied
,
wondering
much
who
the
gentleman
could
be
,
and
what
he
wanted
;
the
little
old
gentleman
,
waiting
till
he
was
out
of
sight
,
tapped
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
"
said
Arabella
.
   
<EOS>
"
Um
,
a
pretty
voice
,
at
any
rate
,
"
murmured
the
little
old
gentleman
;
"
but
that
's
nothing
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
,
he
opened
the
door
and
walked
in
.
 
<EOS>
Arabella
,
who
was
sitting
at
work
,
rose
on
beholding
a
stranger
---
<EOS>
a
little
confused
---
but
by
no
means
ungracefully
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
rise
,
ma'am
,
"
said
the
unknown
,
walking
in
,
and
closing
the
door
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Winkle
,
I
believe
?
"
   
<EOS>
Arabella
inclined
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Nathaniel
Winkle
,
who
married
the
son
of
the
old
man
at
Birmingham
?
"
said
the
stranger
,
eyeing
Arabella
with
visible
curiosity
.
   
<EOS>
Again
Arabella
inclined
her
head
,
and
looked
uneasily
round
,
as
if
uncertain
whether
to
call
for
assistance
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
surprise
you
,
I
see
,
ma'am
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rather
,
I
confess
,
"
replied
Arabella
,
wondering
more
and
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
a
chair
,
if
you
'll
allow
me
,
ma'am
,
"
said
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
He
took
one
;
and
drawing
a
spectacle
-
case
from
his
pocket
,
leisurely
pulled
out
a
pair
of
spectacles
,
which
he
adjusted
on
his
nose
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
me
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
,
looking
so
intently
at
Arabella
that
she
began
to
feel
alarmed
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
she
replied
timidly
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
nursing
his
left
leg
;
"
I
do
n't
know
how
you
should
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
my
name
,
though
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
I
?
"
said
Arabella
,
trembling
,
though
she
scarcely
knew
why
.
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
what
it
is
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Presently
,
ma'am
,
presently
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
not
having
yet
removed
his
eyes
from
her
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
recently
married
,
ma'am
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
replied
Arabella
,
in
a
scarcely
audible
tone
,
laying
aside
her
work
,
and
becoming
greatly
agitated
as
a
thought
,
that
had
occurred
to
her
before
,
struck
more
forcibly
upon
her
mind
.
   
<EOS>
"
Without
having
represented
to
your
husband
the
propriety
of
first
consulting
his
father
,
on
whom
he
is
dependent
,
I
think
?
"
said
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
Arabella
applied
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Without
an
endeavour
,
even
,
to
ascertain
,
by
some
indirect
appeal
,
what
were
the
old
man
's
sentiments
on
a
point
in
which
he
would
naturally
feel
much
interested
?
"
said
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
deny
it
,
Sir
,
"
said
Arabella
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
without
having
sufficient
property
of
your
own
to
afford
your
husband
any
permanent
assistance
in
exchange
for
the
worldly
advantages
which
you
knew
he
would
have
gained
if
he
had
married
agreeably
to
his
father
's
wishes
?
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
what
boys
and
girls
call
disinterested
affection
,
till
they
have
boys
and
girls
of
their
own
,
and
then
they
see
it
in
a
rougher
and
very
different
light
!
"
   
<EOS>
Arabella
's
tears
flowed
fast
,
as
she
pleaded
in
extenuation
that
she
was
young
and
inexperienced
;
<EOS>
that
her
attachment
had
alone
induced
her
to
take
the
step
to
which
she
had
resorted
;
and
that
she
had
been
deprived
of
the
counsel
and
guidance
of
her
parents
almost
from
infancy
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
wrong
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
in
a
milder
tone
,
"
very
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
romantic
,
unbusinesslike
,
foolish
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
my
fault
;
all
my
fault
,
Sir
,
"
replied
poor
Arabella
,
weeping
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
;
"
it
was
not
your
fault
that
he
fell
in
love
with
you
,
I
suppose
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
it
was
,
though
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
looking
rather
slily
at
Arabella
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
your
fault
.
<EOS>
He
could
n't
help
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
little
compliment
,
or
the
little
gentleman
's
odd
way
of
paying
it
,
or
his
altered
manner
---
so
much
kinder
than
it
was
,
at
first
---
or
all
three
together
,
forced
a
smile
from
Arabella
in
the
midst
of
her
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
's
your
husband
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
old
gentleman
,
abruptly
;
stopping
a
smile
which
was
just
coming
over
his
own
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
expect
him
every
instant
,
sir
,
"
said
Arabella
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
persuaded
him
to
take
a
walk
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
very
low
and
wretched
at
not
having
heard
from
his
father
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Low
,
is
he
?
"
said
the
old
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
"
Serve
him
right
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
feels
it
on
my
account
,
I
am
afraid
,
"
said
Arabella
;
"
and
indeed
,
Sir
,
I
feel
it
deeply
on
his
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
the
sole
means
of
bringing
him
to
his
present
condition
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mind
it
on
his
account
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
It
serves
him
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
it
---
actually
glad
of
it
,
as
far
as
he
is
concerned
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
words
were
scarcely
out
of
the
old
gentleman
's
lips
,
when
footsteps
were
heard
ascending
the
stairs
,
which
he
and
Arabella
seemed
both
to
recognise
at
the
same
moment
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
gentleman
turned
pale
;
and
,
making
a
strong
effort
to
appear
composed
,
stood
up
,
as
Mr
Winkle
entered
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Father
!
"
cried
Mr
Winkle
,
recoiling
in
amazement
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
little
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
what
have
you
got
to
say
to
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
remained
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
ashamed
of
yourself
,
I
hope
,
Sir
?
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
Still
Mr
Winkle
said
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
ashamed
of
yourself
,
Sir
,
or
are
you
not
?
"
inquired
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Winkle
,
drawing
Arabella
's
arm
through
his
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
ashamed
of
myself
,
or
of
my
wife
either
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
!
"
cried
the
old
gentleman
ironically
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
to
have
done
anything
which
has
lessened
your
affection
for
me
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Winkle
;
"
but
I
will
say
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
I
have
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
having
this
lady
for
my
wife
,
nor
you
of
having
her
for
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Give
me
your
hand
,
Nat
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
in
an
altered
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Kiss
me
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
very
charming
little
daughter
-
in
-
law
after
all
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
"
time
Mr
Winkle
went
in
search
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
returning
with
that
gentleman
,
presented
him
to
his
father
,
whereupon
they
shook
hands
for
five
minutes
incessantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
I
thank
you
most
heartily
for
all
your
kindness
to
my
son
,
"
said
old
Mr
Winkle
,
in
a
bluff
,
straightforward
way
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
hasty
fellow
,
and
when
I
saw
you
last
,
I
was
vexed
and
taken
by
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
judged
for
myself
now
,
and
am
more
than
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
make
any
more
apologies
,
Mr
Pickwick
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
one
,
"
replied
that
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
done
the
only
thing
wanting
to
complete
my
happiness
.
"
   
<EOS>
Hereupon
<EOS>
there
was
another
shaking
of
hands
for
five
minutes
longer
,
accompanied
by
a
great
number
of
complimentary
speeches
,
which
,
besides
being
complimentary
,
had
the
additional
and
very
novel
recommendation
of
being
sincere
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
had
dutifully
seen
his
father
to
the
Belle
Sauvage
,
when
,
on
returning
,
he
encountered
the
fat
boy
in
the
court
,
who
had
been
charged
with
the
delivery
of
a
note
from
Emily
Wardle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
said
Joe
,
who
was
unusually
loquacious
,
"
what
a
pretty
girl
Mary
is
,
is
n't
she
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
SO
fond
of
her
,
I
am
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
made
no
verbal
remark
in
reply
;
but
eyeing
the
fat
boy
for
a
moment
,
quite
transfixed
at
his
presumption
,
led
him
by
the
collar
to
the
corner
,
and
dismissed
him
with
a
harmless
but
ceremonious
kick
.
 
<EOS>
After
which
,
he
walked
home

whistling

<EOS>
In
which
the
Pickwick
Club
is
finally
dissolved
,
and
everything
concluded
to
the
satisfaction
of
everybody
 
For
a
whole
week
after
the
happy
arrival
of
Mr
Winkle
from
Birmingham
,
Mr
Pickwick
and
Sam
Weller
were
from
home
all
day
long
,
only
returning
just
in
time
for
dinner
,
and
then
wearing
an
air
of
mystery
and
importance
quite
foreign
to
their
natures
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
that
very
grave
and
eventful
proceedings
were
on
foot
;
but
various
surmises
were
afloat
,
respecting
their
precise
character
.
 
<EOS>
Some
(
among
whom
was
Mr
Tupman
)
were
disposed
to
think
that
Mr
Pickwick
contemplated
a
matrimonial
alliance
;
but
this
idea
the
ladies
most
strenuously
repudiated
.
 
<EOS>
Others
rather
inclined
to
the
belief
that
he
had
projected
some
distant
tour
,
and
was
at
present
occupied
in
effecting
the
preliminary
arrangements
;
but
this
again
was
stoutly
denied
by
Sam
himself
,
who
had
unequivocally
stated
,
when
cross
-
examined
by
Mary
,
that
no
new
journeys
were
to
be
undertaken
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
when
the
brains
of
the
whole
party
had
been
racked
for
six
long
days
,
by
unavailing
speculation
,
it
was
unanimously
resolved
that
Mr
Pickwick
should
be
called
upon
to
explain
his
conduct
,
and
to
state
distinctly
why
he
had
thus
absented
himself
from
the
society
of
his
admiring
friends
.
   
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
Mr
Wardle
invited
the
full
circle
to
dinner
at
the
Adelphi
;
and
the
decanters
having
been
thrice
sent
round
,
opened
the
business
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
all
anxious
to
know
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
"
what
we
have
done
to
offend
you
,
and
to
induce
you
to
desert
us
and
devote
yourself
to
these
solitary
walks
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
?
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
singular
enough
that
I
had
intended
to
volunteer
a
full
explanation
this
very
day
;
so
,
if
you
will
give
me
another
glass
of
wine
,
I
will
satisfy
your
curiosity
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
decanters
passed
from
hand
to
hand
with
unwonted
briskness
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
,
looking
round
on
the
faces
of
his
friends
with
a
cheerful
smile
,
proceeded
---
"
All
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
among
us
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
<EOS>
I
mean
the
marriage
that
HAS
taken
place
,
and
the
marriage
that
WILL
take
place
,
with
the
changes
they
involve
,
rendered
it
necessary
for
me
to
think
,
soberly
and
at
once
,
upon
my
future
plans
.
 
<EOS>
I
determined
on
retiring
to
some
quiet
,
pretty
neighbourhood
in
the
vicinity
of
London
;
I
saw
a
house
which
exactly
suited
my
fancy
;
I
have
taken
it
and
furnished
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
fully
prepared
for
my
reception
,
and
I
intend
entering
upon
it
at
once
,
trusting
that
I
may
yet
live
to
spend
many
quiet
years
in
peaceful
retirement
,
cheered
through
life
by
the
society
of
my
friends
,
and
followed
in
death
by
their
affectionate
remembrance
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Pickwick
paused
,
and
a
low
murmur
ran
round
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
house
I
have
taken
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
is
at
Dulwich
.
<EOS>
It
has
a
large
garden
,
and
is
situated
in
one
of
the
most
pleasant
spots
near
London
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
fitted
up
with
every
attention
to
substantial
comfort
;
perhaps
to
a
little
elegance
besides
;
but
of
that
you
shall
judge
for
yourselves
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
accompanies
me
there
.
<EOS>
I
have
engaged
,
on
Perker
's
representation
,
a
housekeeper
---
a
very
old
one
---
and
such
other
servants
as
she
thinks
I
shall
require
.
 
<EOS>
I
propose
to
consecrate
this
little
retreat
,
by
having
a
ceremony
in
which
I
take
a
great
interest
,
performed
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
,
if
my
friend
Wardle
entertains
no
objection
,
that
his
daughter
should
be
married
from
my
new
house
,
on
the
day
I
take
possession
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
happiness
of
young
people
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
a
little
moved
,
"
has
ever
been
the
chief
pleasure
of
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
warm
my
heart
to
witness
the
happiness
of
those
friends
who
are
dearest
to
me
,
beneath
my
own
roof
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
paused
again
:
Emily
and
Arabella
sobbed
audibly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
communicated
,
both
personally
and
by
letter
,
with
the
club
,
"
resumed
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
acquainting
them
with
my
intention
.
<EOS>
During
our
long
absence
,
it
has
suffered
much
from
internal
dissentions
;
and
the
withdrawal
of
my
name
,
coupled
with
this
and
other
circumstances
,
has
occasioned
its
dissolution
.
 
<EOS>
The
Pickwick
Club
exists
no
longer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
regret
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
in
a
low
voice
,
"
I
shall
never
regret
having
devoted
the
greater
part
of
two
years
to
mixing
with
different
varieties
and
shades
of
human
character
,
frivolous
as
my
pursuit
of
novelty
may
have
appeared
to
many
.
<EOS>
Nearly
the
whole
of
my
previous
life
having
been
devoted
to
business
and
the
pursuit
of
wealth
,
numerous
scenes
of
which
I
had
no
previous
conception
have
dawned
upon
me
---
I
hope
to
the
enlargement
of
my
mind
,
and
the
improvement
of
my
understanding
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
have
done
but
<EOS>
little
good
,
I
trust
I
have
done
less
harm
,
and
that
none
of
my
adventures
will
be
other
than
a
source
of
amusing
and
pleasant
recollection
to
me
in
the
decline
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
all
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
Mr
Pickwick
filled
and
drained
a
bumper
with
a
trembling
hand
;
and
his
eyes
moistened
as
his
friends
rose
with
one
accord
,
and
pledged
him
from
their
hearts
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
few
preparatory
arrangements
to
be
made
for
the
marriage
of
Mr
Snodgrass
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
had
neither
father
nor
mother
,
and
had
been
in
his
minority
a
ward
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
,
that
gentleman
was
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
his
possessions
and
prospects
.
 
<EOS>
His
account
of
both
was
quite
satisfactory
to
Wardle
 
---
<EOS>
as
almost
any
other
account
would
have
been
,
for
<EOS>
the
good
old
gentleman
was
overflowing
with
Hilarity
and
kindness
---
and
a
handsome
portion
having
been
bestowed
upon
Emily
,
the
marriage
was
fixed
to
take
place
on
the
fourth
day
from
that
time
 
---
the
suddenness
of
which
preparations
reduced
three
dressmakers
and
a
tailor
to
the
extreme
verge
of
insanity
.
   
<EOS>
Getting
post
-
horses
to
the
carriage
,
old
Wardle
started
off
,
next
day
,
to
bring
his
mother
back
to
town
.
 
<EOS>
Communicating
his
intelligence
to
the
old
lady
with
characteristic
impetuosity
,
she
instantly
fainted
away
;
but
being
promptly
revived
,
ordered
the
brocaded
silk
gown
to
be
packed
up
forthwith
,
and
proceeded
to
relate
some
circumstances
of
a
similar
nature
attending
the
marriage
of
the
eldest
daughter
of
Lady
Tollimglower
,
deceased
,
which
occupied
three
hours
in
the
recital
,
and
were
not
half
finished
at
last
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Trundle
had
to
be
informed
of
all
the
mighty
preparations
that
were
making
in
London
;
and
,
being
in
a
delicate
state
of
health
,
was
informed
thereof
through
Mr
Trundle
,
lest
the
news
should
be
too
much
for
her
;
but
it
was
not
too
much
for
her
,
inasmuch
as
she
at
once
wrote
off
to
Muggleton
,
to
order
a
new
cap
and
a
black
satin
gown
,
and
moreover
avowed
her
determination
of
being
present
at
the
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
Hereupon
,
Mr
Trundle
called
in
the
doctor
,
and
the
doctor
said
Mrs
Trundle
ought
to
know
best
how
she
felt
herself
,
to
which
Mrs
Trundle
replied
that
she
felt
herself
quite
equal
to
it
,
and
that
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
go
;
upon
which
the
doctor
,
who
was
a
wise
and
discreet
doctor
,
and
knew
what
was
good
for
himself
,
as
well
as
for
other
people
,
said
that
perhaps
if
Mrs
Trundle
stopped
at
home
,
she
might
hurt
herself
more
by
fretting
,
than
by
going
,
so
perhaps
she
had
better
go
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
did
go
;
the
doctor
with
great
attention
sending
in
half
a
dozen
of
medicine
,
to
be
drunk
upon
the
road
.
   
<EOS>
In
addition
to
these
points
of
distraction
,
Wardle
was
intrusted
with
two
small
letters
to
two
small
young
ladies
who
were
to
act
as
bridesmaids
;
upon
the
receipt
of
which
,
the
two
young
ladies
were
driven
to
despair
by
having
no
"
things
"
ready
for
so
important
an
occasion
,
and
no
time
to
make
them
in
---
a
circumstance
which
appeared
to
afford
the
two
worthy
papas
of
the
two
small
young
ladies
rather
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
than
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
old
frocks
were
trimmed
,
and
new
bonnets
made
,
and
the
young
ladies
looked
as
well
as
could
possibly
have
been
expected
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
they
cried
at
the
subsequent
ceremony
in
the
proper
places
,
and
trembled
at
the
right
times
,
they
acquitted
themselves
to
the
admiration
of
all
beholders
.
<EOS>
How
the
two
poor
relations
ever
reached
London
---
whether
they
walked
,
or
got
behind
coaches
,
or
procured
lifts
in
wagons
,
or
carried
each
other
by
turns
---
is
uncertain
;
but
there
they
were
,
before
Wardle
;
and
the
very
first
people
that
knocked
at
the
door
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
house
,
on
the
bridal
morning
,
were
the
two
poor
relations
,
all
smiles
and
shirt
collar
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
welcomed
heartily
though
,
for
riches
or
poverty
had
no
influence
on
Mr
Pickwick
;
the
new
servants
were
all
alacrity
and
readiness
;
Sam
was
in
a
most
unrivalled
state
of
high
spirits
and
excitement
;
Mary
was
glowing
with
beauty
and
smart
ribands
.
   
<EOS>
The
bridegroom
,
who
had
been
staying
at
the
house
for
two
or
three
days
previous
,
sallied
forth
gallantly
to
Dulwich
Church
to
meet
the
bride
,
attended
by
Mr
Pickwick
,
Ben
Allen
,
Bob
Sawyer
,
and
Mr
Tupman
;
with
Sam
Weller
outside
,
having
at
his
button
-
hole
a
white
favour
,
the
gift
of
his
lady
-
love
,
and
clad
in
a
new
and
gorgeous
suit
of
livery
invented
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
They
were
met
by
the
Wardles
,
and
the
Winkles
,
and
the
bride
and
bridesmaids
,
and
the
Trundles
;
and
the
ceremony
having
been
performed
,
the
coaches
rattled
back
to
Mr
Pickwick
's
to
breakfast
,
where
little
Mr
Perker
already
awaited
them
.
   
<EOS>
Here
,
all
the
light
clouds
of
the
more
solemn
part
of
the
proceedings
passed
away
;
every
face
shone
forth
joyously
;
and
nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
congratulations
and
commendations
.
<EOS>
Everything
was
so
beautiful
!
 
<EOS>
The
lawn
in
front
,
the
garden
behind
,
the
miniature
conservatory
,
the
dining
-
room
,
the
drawing
-
room
,
the
bedrooms
,
the
smoking
-
room
,
and
,
above
all
,
the
study
,
with
its
pictures
and
easy
-
chairs
,
and
odd
cabinets
,
and
queer
tables
,
and
books
out
of
number
,
with
a
large
cheerful
window
opening
upon
a
pleasant
lawn
and
commanding
a
pretty
landscape
,
dotted
here
and
there
with
little
houses
almost
hidden
by
the
trees
;
and
then
the
curtains
,
and
the
carpets
,
and
the
chairs
,
and
the
sofas
!
 
<EOS>
Everything
was
so
beautiful
,
so
compact
,
so
neat
,
and
in
such
exquisite
taste
,
said
everybody
,
that
there
really
was
no
deciding
what
to
admire
most
.
   
<EOS>
And
in
the
midst
of
all
this
,
stood
Mr
Pickwick
,
<EOS>
his
countenance
lighted
up
with
smiles
,
which
the
heart
of
no
man
,
woman
,
or
child
,
could
resist
:
himself
the
happiest
of
the
group
:
shaking
hands
,
over
and
over
again
,
with
the
same
people
,
and
when
his
own
hands
were
not
so
employed
,
rubbing
them
with
pleasure
:
turning
round
in
a
different
direction
at
every
fresh
expression
of
gratification
or
curiosity
,
and
inspiring
everybody
with
his
looks
of
gladness
and
delight
.
   
<EOS>
Breakfast
is
announced
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
leads
the
old
lady
(
who
has
been
very
eloquent
on
the
subject
of
Lady
Tollimglower
)
to
the
top
of
a
long
table
;
Wardle
takes
the
bottom
;
the
friends
arrange
themselves
on
either
side
;
Sam
takes
his
station
behind
his
master
's
chair
;
the
laughter
and
talking
cease
;
Mr
Pickwick
,
having
said
grace
,
pauses
for
an
instant
and
looks
round
him
.
<EOS>
As
he
does
so
,
the
tears
roll
down
his
cheeks
,
in
the
fullness
of
his
joy
.
   
<EOS>
Let
us
leave
our
old
friend
in
one
of
those
moments
of
unmixed
happiness
,
of
which
,
if
we
seek
them
,
there
are
ever
some
,
to
cheer
our
transitory
existence
here
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
dark
shadows
on
the
earth
,
but
its
lights
are
stronger
in
the
contrast
.
 
<EOS>
Some
men
,
like
bats
or
owls
,
have
better
eyes
for
the
darkness
than
for
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
We
,
who
have
no
such
optical
powers
,
are
better
pleased
to
take
our
last
parting
look
at
the
visionary
companions
of
many
solitary
hours
,
when
the
brief
sunshine
of
the
world
is
blazing
full
upon
them
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
the
fate
of
most
men
who
mingle
with
the
world
,
and
attain
even
the
prime
of
life
,
to
make
many
real
friends
,
and
lose
them
in
the
course
of
nature
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
fate
of
all
authors
or
chroniclers
to
create
imaginary
friends
,
and
lose
them
in
the
course
of
art
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
is
this
the
full
extent
of
their
misfortunes
;
for
they
are
required
to
furnish
an
account
of
them
besides
.
   
<EOS>
In
compliance
with
this
custom
---
unquestionably
a
bad
one
 
<EOS>
---
we
subjoin
a
few
biographical
words
,
in
relation
to
the
party
at
Mr
Pickwick
's
<EOS>
assembled
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Winkle
,
being
fully
received
into
favour
by
the
old
gentleman
,
were
shortly
afterwards
installed
in
a
newly
-
built
house
,
not
half
a
mile
from
Mr
Pickwick
's
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Winkle
,
being
engaged
in
the
city
as
agent
or
town
correspondent
of
his
father
,
exchanged
his
old
costume
for
the
ordinary
dress
of
Englishmen
,
and
presented
all
the
external
appearance
of
a
civilised
Christian
ever
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Snodgrass
settled
at
Dingley
Dell
,
where
they
purchased
and
cultivated
a
small
farm
,
more
for
occupation
than
profit
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Snodgrass
,
being
occasionally
abstracted
and
melancholy
,
is
to
this
day
reputed
a
great
poet
among
his
friends
and
acquaintance
,
although
we
do
not
find
that
he
has
ever
written
anything
to
encourage
the
belief
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
many
celebrated
characters
,
literary
,
philosophical
,
and
otherwise
,
who
hold
a
high
reputation
on
a
similar
tenure
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tupman
,
when
his
friends
married
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
settled
,
took
lodgings
at
Richmond
,
where
he
has
ever
since
resided
.
 
<EOS>
He
walks
constantly
on
the
terrace
during
the
summer
months
,
with
a
youthful
and
jaunty
air
,
which
has
rendered
him
the
admiration
of
the
numerous
elderly
ladies
of
single
condition
,
who
reside
in
the
vicinity
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
never
proposed
again
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bob
Sawyer
,
having
previously
passed
through
the
GAZETTE
,
passed
over
to
Bengal
,
accompanied
by
Mr
Benjamin
Allen
;
both
gentlemen
having
received
surgical
appointments
from
the
East
India
Company
.
 
<EOS>
They
each
had
the
yellow
fever
fourteen
times
,
and
then
resolved
to
try
a
little
abstinence
;
since
which
period
,
they
have
been
doing
well
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Bardell
let
lodgings
to
many
conversable
single
gentlemen
,
with
great
profit
,
but
never
brought
any
more
actions
for
breach
of
promise
of
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
Her
attorneys
,
Messrs.
Dodson
&
Fogg
,
continue
in
business
,
from
which
they
realise
a
large
income
,
and
in
which
they
are
universally
considered
among
the
sharpest
of
the
sharp
.
   
<EOS>
Sam
Weller
kept
his
word
,
and
remained
unmarried
,
for
two
years
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
housekeeper
dying
at
the
end
of
that
time
,
Mr
Pickwick
promoted
Mary
to
the
situation
,
on
condition
of
her
marrying
Mr
Weller
at
once
,
which
she
did
without
a
murmur
.
<EOS>
From
the
circumstance
of
two
sturdy
little
boys
having
been
repeatedly
seen
at
the
gate
of
the
back
garden
,
there
is
reason
to
suppose
that
Sam
has
some
family
.
   
<EOS>
The
elder
Mr
Weller
drove
a
coach
for
twelve
months
,
but
being
afflicted
with
the
gout
,
was
compelled
to
retire
.
 
<EOS>
The
contents
of
the
pocket
-
book
had
been
so
well
invested
for
him
,
however
,
by
Mr
Pickwick
,
that
he
had
a
handsome
independence
to
retire
on
,
upon
which
he
still
lives
at
an
excellent
public
-
house
near
Shooter
's
Hill
,
where
he
is
quite
reverenced
as
an
oracle
,
boasting
very
much
of
his
intimacy
with
Mr
Pickwick
,
and
retaining
a
most
unconquerable
aversion
to
widows
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
himself
continued
to
reside
in
his
new
house
,
employing
his
leisure
hours
in
arranging
the
memoranda
which
he
afterwards
presented
to
the
secretary
of
the
once
famous
club
,
or
in
hearing
Sam
Weller
read
aloud
,
with
such
remarks
as
suggested
themselves
to
his
mind
,
which
never
failed
to
afford
Mr
Pickwick
great
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
much
troubled
at
first
,
by
the
numerous
applications
made
to
him
by
Mr
Snodgrass
,
Mr
Winkle
,
and
Mr
Trundle
,
to
act
as
godfather
to
their
offspring
;
but
he
has
become
used
to
it
now
,
and
officiates
as
a
matter
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
had
occasion
to
regret
his
bounty
to
Mr
Jingle
;
for
both
that
person
and
<EOS>
Job
Trotter
became
,
in
time
,
worthy
members
of
society
,
although
they
have
always
steadily
objected
to
return
to
the
scenes
of
their
old
haunts
and
temptations
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
is
somewhat
infirm
now
;
but
he
retains
all
his
former
juvenility
of
spirit
,
and
may
still
be
frequently
seen
,
contemplating
the
pictures
in
the
Dulwich
Gallery
,
or
enjoying
a
walk
about
the
pleasant
neighbourhood
on
a
fine
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
known
by
all
the
poor
people
about
,
who
never
fail
to
take
their
hats
off
,
as
he
passes
,
with
great
respect
.
 
<EOS>
The
children
idolise
him
,
and
so
indeed
does
the
whole
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
Every
year
he
repairs
to
a
large
family
merry
-
making
at
Mr
Wardle
's
;
on
this
,
as
on
all
other
occasions
,
he
is
invariably
attended
by
the
faithful
Sam
,
between
whom
and
<EOS>
his
master
there
exists
a
steady
and
reciprocal
attachment
which
nothing
but
death
will
terminate
.
