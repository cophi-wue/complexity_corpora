"
Oh

MANCHESTER
SONG
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
some
fields
near
Manchester
,
well
known
to
the
inhabitants
as
"
Green
Heys
Fields
,
"
through
which
runs
a
public
footpath
to
a
little
village
about
two
miles
distant
.
 
<EOS>
In
spite
of
these
fields
being
flat
,
and
low
,
nay
,
in
spite
of
the
want
of
wood
(
the
great
and
usual
recommendation
of
level
tracts
of
land
)
,
there
is
a
charm
about
them
which
strikes
even
the
inhabitant
of
a
mountainous
district
,
who
sees
and
feels
the
effect
of
contrast
in
these
commonplace
but
thoroughly
rural
fields
,
with
the
busy
,
bustling
manufacturing
town
he
left
<EOS>
but
half
-
an
-
hour
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Here
and
there
an
old
black
and
white
farmhouse
,
with
its
rambling
outbuildings
,
speaks
of
other
times
and
other
occupations
than
those
which
now
absorb
the
population
of
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
Here
in
their
seasons
may
be
seen
the
country
business
of
haymaking
,
ploughing
,
etc
.
,
which
are
such
pleasant
mysteries
for
townspeople
to
watch
:
and
here
the
artisan
,
deafened
with
noise
of
tongues
and
engines
,
may
come
to
listen
awhile
to
the
delicious
sounds
of
rural
life
:
<EOS>
the
lowing
of
cattle
,
the
milkmaid
's
call
,
the
clatter
and
cackle
of
poultry
in
the
farmyards
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
wonder
,
then
,
that
these
fields
are
popular
places
of
resort
at
every
holiday
time
;
and
you
would
not
wonder
,
if
you
could
see
,
or
I
properly
describe
,
the
charm
of
one
particular
stile
,
that
it
should
be
,
on
such
occasions
,
a
crowded
halting
place
.
 
<EOS>
Close
by
it
is
a
deep
,
clear
pond
,
reflecting
in
its
dark
green
depths
the
shadowy
trees
that
bend
over
it
to
exclude
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
place
where
its
banks
are
shelving
is
on
the
side
next
to
a
rambling
farmyard
,
belonging
to
one
of
those
old
world
,
gabled
,
black
and
white
houses
I
named
above
,
overlooking
the
field
through
which
the
public
footpath
leads
.
 
<EOS>
The
porch
of
this
farmhouse
is
covered
by
a
rose
-
tree
;
and
the
little
garden
surrounding
it
is
crowded
with
a
medley
of
old
-
fashioned
herbs
and
flowers
,
planted
long
ago
,
when
the
garden
was
the
only
druggist
's
shop
within
reach
,
and
allowed
to
grow
in
scrambling
and
wild
luxuriance
 
roses
,
lavender
,
sage
,
balm
(
for
tea
)
,
rosemary
,
pinks
and
wallflowers
,
onions
and
jessamine
,
in
most
republican
and
indiscriminate
order
.
 
<EOS>
This
farmhouse
and
garden
are
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
stile
of
which
I
spoke
,
leading
from
the
large
pasture
field
into
a
smaller
one
,
divided
by
a
hedge
of
hawthorn
and
blackthorn
;
and
near
this
stile
,
on
the
further
side
<EOS>
,
there
runs
a
tale
that
primroses
may
often
be
found
,
and
occasionally
the
blue
sweet
violet
on
the
grassy
hedge
bank
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
it
was
on
a
holiday
granted
by
the
masters
,
or
a
holiday
seized
in
right
of
Nature
and
her
beautiful
spring
time
by
the
workmen
,
but
one
afternoon
(
now
ten
or
a
dozen
years
ago
)
<EOS>
these
fields
were
much
thronged
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
early
May
evening
 
<EOS>
the
April
of
the
poets
;
for
heavy
showers
had
fallen
all
the
morning
,
and
the
round
,
soft
,
white
clouds
which
were
blown
by
a
west
wind
over
the
dark
blue
sky
,
were
sometimes
varied
by
one
blacker
and
more
threatening
.
 
<EOS>
The
softness
of
the
day
tempted
forth
the
young
green
leaves
,
which
almost
visibly
fluttered
into
life
;
and
the
willows
,
which
that
morning
had
had
only
a
brown
reflection
in
the
water
below
,
were
now
of
that
tender
grey
-
green
which
blends
so
delicately
with
the
spring
harmony
of
colours
.
  
<EOS>
Groups
of
merry
and
somewhat
loud
-
talking
girls
,
whose
ages
might
range
from
twelve
to
twenty
,
came
by
with
a
buoyant
step
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
most
of
them
factory
girls
,
and
wore
the
usual
out
-
of
-
doors
dress
of
that
particular
class
of
maidens
;
namely
,
a
shawl
,
which
at
midday
or
in
fine
weather
was
allowed
to
be
merely
a
shawl
,
but
towards
evening
,
if
the
day
was
chilly
,
became
a
sort
of
Spanish
mantilla
or
Scotch
plaid
,
and
was
brought
over
the
head
and
hung
loosely
down
,
or
was
pinned
under
the
chin
in
no
unpicturesque
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
Their
faces
were
not
remarkable
for
beauty
;
indeed
,
they
were
below
the
average
,
with
one
or
two
exceptions
;
they
had
dark
hair
,
neatly
and
classically
arranged
,
dark
eyes
,
but
sallow
complexions
and
irregular
features
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
thing
to
strike
a
passer
-
by
was
an
acuteness
and
intelligence
of
countenance
,
which
has
often
been
noticed
in
a
manufacturing
population
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
also
numbers
of
boys
,
or
rather
young
men
,
rambling
among
these
fields
,
ready
to
bandy
jokes
with
any
one
,
and
particularly
ready
to
enter
into
conversation
with
the
girls
,
who
,
however
,
held
themselves
aloof
,
not
in
a
shy
,
but
rather
in
an
independent
way
,
assuming
an
indifferent
manner
to
the
noisy
wit
or
obstreperous
compliments
of
the
lads
.
 
<EOS>
Here
and
there
came
a
sober
,
quiet
couple
,
either
whispering
lovers
,
or
husband
and
wife
,
as
the
case
might
be
;
and
if
the
latter
,
they
were
seldom
unencumbered
by
an
infant
,
carried
for
the
most
part
by
the
father
,
while
occasionally
even
three
or
four
<EOS>
little
toddlers
had
been
carried
or
dragged
thus
far
,
in
order
that
the
whole
family
might
enjoy
the
delicious
May
afternoon
together
.
  
<EOS>
Some
time
in
the
course
of
that
afternoon
,
two
working
men
met
with
friendly
greeting
at
the
stile
so
often
named
.
 
<EOS>
One
was
a
thorough
specimen
of
a
Manchester
man
;
born
of
factory
workers
,
and
himself
bred
up
in
youth
,
and
living
in
manhood
,
among
the
mills
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
below
the
middle
size
and
slightly
made
;
there
was
almost
a
stunted
look
about
him
;
and
his
wan
,
colourless
face
gave
you
the
idea
,
that
in
his
childhood
he
had
suffered
from
the
scanty
living
consequent
upon
bad
times
and
improvident
habits
.
 
<EOS>
His
features
were
strongly
marked
,
though
not
irregular
,
and
their
expression
was
extreme
earnestness
;
resolute
either
for
good
or
evil
,
a
sort
of
latent
stern
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
time
of
which
I
write
,
the
good
predominated
over
the
bad
in
the
countenance
,
and
he
was
one
from
whom
a
stranger
would
have
asked
a
favour
with
tolerable
faith
that
it
would
be
granted
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
accompanied
by
his
wife
,
who
might
,
without
exaggeration
,
have
been
called
a
lovely
woman
,
although
now
her
face
was
swollen
with
crying
,
and
often
hidden
behind
her
apron
.
<EOS>
She
had
the
fresh
beauty
of
the
agricultural
districts
;
and
somewhat
of
the
deficiency
of
sense
in
her
countenance
,
which
is
likewise
characteristic
of
the
rural
inhabitants
in
comparison
with
the
natives
of
the
manufacturing
towns
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
far
advanced
in
pregnancy
,
which
perhaps
occasioned
the
overpowering
and
hysterical
nature
of
her
grief
.
 
<EOS>
The
friend
whom
they
met
was
more
handsome
and
less
sensible
-
looking
than
the
man
I
have
just
described
;
he
seemed
hearty
and
hopeful
,
and
although
his
age
was
greater
,
yet
there
was
far
more
of
youth
's
buoyancy
in
his
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
tenderly
carrying
a
baby
in
arms
,
while
his
wife
,
a
delicate
,
fragile
-
looking
woman
,
limping
in
her
gait
,
bore
another
of
the
same
age
;
little
,
feeble
twins
,
inheriting
the
frail
appearance
of
their
mother
.
  
<EOS>
The
last
-
mentioned
man
was
the
first
to
speak
,
while
a
sudden
look
of
sympathy
dimmed
his
gladsome
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
John
,
how
goes
it
with
you
?
"
<EOS>
and
in
a
lower
voice
,
he
added
,
"
Any
news
of
Esther
yet
?
"
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
wives
greeted
each
other
like
old
friends
,
the
soft
and
plaintive
voice
of
the
mother
of
the
twins
seeming
to
call
forth
only
fresh
sobs
from
Mrs.
Barton
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
women
,
"
said
John
Barton
,
"
you
've
both
walked
far
enough
.
 
<EOS>
My
Mary
expects
to
have
her
bed
in
three
weeks
;
and
as
for
you
,
Mrs.
Wilson
,
you
know
you
are
but
a
cranky
sort
of
a
body
at
the
best
of
times
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
This
was
said
so
kindly
,
that
no
offence
could
be
taken
.
"
<EOS>
Sit
you
down
here
;
the
grass
is
well
nigh
dry
by
this
time
;
and
you
're
neither
of
you
nesh
<EOS>
*
folk
about
taking
cold
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
,
"
he
added
,
with
some
tenderness
,
"
here
's
my
pocket
-
handkerchief
to
spread
under
you
to
save
the
gowns
women
always
think
so
much
on
;
and
now
,
Mrs.
Wilson
,
give
me
the
baby
,
I
may
as
well
carry
him
,
while
you
talk
and
comfort
my
wife
;
poor
thing
<EOS>
,
she
takes
on
sadly
about
Esther
.
"
     
<EOS>
These
arrangements
were
soon
completed
;
the
two
women
sat
down
on
the
blue
cotton
handkerchiefs
of
their
husbands
,
and
the
latter
,
each
carrying
a
baby
,
set
off
for
a
further
walk
;
but
as
soon
as
Barton
had
turned
his
back
upon
his
wife
,
his
countenance
fell
back
into
an
expression
of
gloom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
've
heard
nothing
of
Esther
,
poor
lass
?
"
asked
Wilson
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
nor
sha
n't
,
as
I
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
mind
is
,
she
's
gone
off
with
somebody
.
 
<EOS>
My
wife
frets
and
thinks
she
's
drowned
herself
,
but
<EOS>
I
tell
her
,
folks
do
n't
care
to
put
on
their
best
clothes
to
drown
themselves
;
and
Mrs.
Bradshaw
(
where
she
lodged
,
you
know
)
says
the
last
time
she
set
eyes
on
her
<EOS>
was
last
Tuesday
,
<EOS>
when
she
came
downstairs
,
dressed
in
her
Sunday
gown
,
and
with
a
new
ribbon
in
her
bonnet
,
and
gloves
on
her
hands
,
like
the
lady
she
was
so
fond
of
thinking
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
as
pretty
a
creature
as
ever
the
sun
shone
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
she
was
a
farrantly
*
lass
;
more
's
the
pity
now
,
"
added
Barton
,
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
them
<EOS>
Buckinghamshire
people
as
comes
to
work
here
<EOS>
has
quite
a
different
look
with
them
to
us
Manchester
folk
.
<EOS>
You
'll
not
see
among
the
Manchester
wenches
such
fresh
rosy
cheeks
,
or
such
black
lashes
to
grey
eyes
(
making
them
look
like
black
)
,
as
my
wife
and
Esther
had
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
seed
two
such
pretty
women
for
sisters
;
never
.
 
<EOS>
Not
<EOS>
but
what
beauty
is
a
sad
snare
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
Esther
so
puffed
up
,
that
there
was
no
holding
her
in
.
 
<EOS>
Her
spirit
was
always
up
,
if
I
spoke
ever
so
little
in
the
way
of
advice
to
her
;
my
wife
spoiled
her
,
it
is
true
,
for
you
see
she
was
so
much
older
than
Esther
<EOS>
,
she
was
more
like
a
mother
to
her
,
doing
everything
for
her
.
"
     
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
she
ever
left
you
,
"
observed
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
worst
of
factory
work
for
girls
.
 
<EOS>
They
can
earn
so
much
when
work
is
plenty
,
that
they
can
maintain
themselves
anyhow
.
 
<EOS>
My
Mary
shall
never
work
in
a
factory
,
that
I
'm
determined
on
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
Esther
spent
her
money
in
dress
,
thinking
to
set
off
her
pretty
face
;
and
got
to
come
home
so
late
at
night
,
that
at
last
I
told
her
my
mind
;
my
missis
thinks
I
spoke
crossly
,
but
I
meant
right
,
for
I
loved
Esther
,
if
it
was
only
for
Mary
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
Says
I
,
"
<EOS>
Esther
,
I
see
what
you
'll
end
at
with
your
artificials
,
and
your
fly
-
away
veils
,
and
stopping
out
when
honest
women
are
in
their
beds
:
you
'll
be
a
street
-
walker
,
Esther
,
and
then
,
do
n't
you
go
to
think
I
'll
have
you
darken
my
door
,
though
my
wife
is
your
sister
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
says
she
,
"
Do
n't
trouble
yourself
,
John
,
I
'll
pack
up
and
be
off
now
,
for
I
'll
never
stay
to
hear
myself
called
as
you
call
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
flushed
up
like
a
turkey
-
cock
,
and
I
thought
fire
would
come
out
of
her
eyes
;
<EOS>
but
when
she
saw
Mary
cry
(
for
Mary
ca
n't
abide
words
in
a
house
)
,
she
went
and
kissed
her
,
and
said
she
was
not
so
bad
as
I
thought
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
we
talked
more
friendly
,
for
,
as
I
said
<EOS>
,
I
liked
the
lass
well
enough
,
and
her
pretty
looks
,
and
her
cheery
ways
.
<EOS>
But
she
said
(
and
at
that
time
I
thought
there
was
sense
in
what
she
said
)
<EOS>
we
should
be
much
better
friends
if
she
went
into
lodgings
,
and
only
came
to
see
us
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
still
were
friendly
.
 
<EOS>
Folks
said
you
'd
cast
her
off
,
and
said
you
'd
never
speak
to
her
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Folks
always
make
one
a
deal
worse
than
one
is
,
"
said
John
Barton
testily
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
came
many
a
time
to
our
house
after
she
left
off
living
with
us
.

Last
Sunday
se'nnight
 
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
it
was
this
very
last
Sunday
,
she
came
to
drink
a
cup
of
tea
with
Mary
;
and
that
was
the
last
time
we
set
eyes
on
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
she
any
ways
different
in
her
manner
?
"
asked
Wilson
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
thought
several
times
since
,
that
she
was
a
bit
quieter
,
and
more
womanly
-
like
;
more
gentle
,
and
more
blushing
,
and
not
so
riotous
and
noisy
.
 
<EOS>
She
comes
in
towards
four
o'clock
,
when
afternoon
church
was
loosing
,
and
she
goes
and
hangs
her
bonnet
up
on
the
old
nail
we
used
to
call
hers
,
while
she
lived
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
thinking
what
a
pretty
lass
she
was
,
as
she
sat
on
a
low
stool
by
Mary
,
who
was
rocking
herself
,
and
in
rather
a
poor
way
.
 
<EOS>
She
laughed
and
cried
by
turns
,
but
all
so
softly
and
gently
,
like
a
child
,
that
I
could
n't
find
in
my
heart
to
scold
her
,
especially
as
Mary
was
fretting
already
.
 
<EOS>
One
thing
I
do
remember
I
did
say
,
and
pretty
sharply
too
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
our
little
Mary
by
the
waist
and
"
    
"
Thou
must
leave
off
calling
her
"
little
"
Mary
<EOS>
,
she
's
growing
up
into
as
fine
a
lass
as
one
can
see
on
a
summer
's
day
;
more
of
her
mother
's
stock
than
thine
,
"
interrupted
Wilson
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
I
call
her
"
little
"
because
her
mother
's
name
is
Mary
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
was
saying
,
she
takes
Mary
in
a
coaxing
sort
of
way
,
and
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
"
says
she
,
"
what
should
you
think
if
I
sent
for
you
some
day
and
made
a
lady
of
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
So
I
could
not
stand
such
talk
as
that
to
my
girl
,
and
I
said
,
"
Thou'd
<EOS>
best
not
put
that
nonsense
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
the
girl
's
head
<EOS>
I
can
tell
thee
<EOS>
;
I
'd
rather
see
her
earning
her
bread
by
the
sweat
of
brow
,
as
the
Bible
tells
her
she
should
do
,
ay
,
though
she
never
got
butter
to
her
bread
,
than
be
like
a
do
-
nothing
lady
,
worrying
shopmen
all
morning
,
and
screeching
at
her
pianny
all
afternoon
,
and
going
to
bed
without
having
done
a
good
turn
to
any
one
of
God
's
creatures
but
herself
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Thou
never
could
abide
the
gentlefolk
,
"
said
Wilson
,
half
amused
at
his
friend
's
vehemence
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
good
have
they
ever
done
me
that
I
should
like
them
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Barton
,
the
latent
fire
lighting
up
his
eye
:
and
bursting
forth
he
continued
,
"
If
I
am
sick
do
they
come
and
nurse
me
?
 
<EOS>
If
my
child
lies
dying
(
as
poor
Tom
lay
,
with
his
white
wan
lips
quivering
,
for
want
of
better
food
than
I
could
give
him
)
,
does
the
rich
man
bring
the
wine
or
broth
that
might
save
his
life
?
 
<EOS>
If
I
am
out
of
work
for
weeks
in
the
bad
times
,
and
winter
comes
,
with
black
frost
,
and
keen
east
wind
,
and
there
is
no
coal
for
the
grate
,
and
no
clothes
for
the
bed
,
and
the
thin
bones
are
seen
through
the
ragged
clothes
,
does
the
rich
man
share
his
plenty
with
me
,
as
he
ought
to
do
,
if
his
religion
was
n't
a
humbug
?
 
<EOS>
When
I
lie
on
my
death
-
bed
and
Mary
(
bless
her
!
)
<EOS>
stands
fretting
,
as
I
know
she
will
fret
,
"
and
here
his
voice
faltered
a
little
,
"
will
a
rich
lady
come
and
take
her
to
her
own
home
if
need
be
,
till
she
can
look
round
,
and
see
what
best
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
tell
you
it
's
the
poor
,
and
the
poor
only
,
as
does
such
things
for
the
poor
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
think
to
come
over
me
with
th
'
old
tale
,
that
the
rich
know
nothing
of
the
trials
of
the
poor
<EOS>
;
I
say
,
if
they
do
n't
know
,
they
ought
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
We
're
their
slaves
as
long
as
we
can
work
;
we
pile
up
their
fortunes
with
the
sweat
of
our
brows
,
and
yet
we
are
to
live
as
separate
as
if
we
were
in
two
worlds
;
ay
,
as
separate
as
Dives
and
Lazarus
,
with
a
great
gulf
betwixt
us
:
<EOS>
but
I
know
who
was
best
off
then
,
"
and
he
wound
up
his
speech
with
a
low
chuckle
that
had
no
mirth
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
neighbour
,
"
said
Wilson
,
"
all
that
may
be
very
true
,
but
what
I
want
to
know
now
is
about
Esther
 
<EOS>
when
did
you
last
hear
of
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
she
took
leave
of
us
that
Sunday
night
in
a
very
loving
way
,
kissing
both
wife
Mary
,
and
daughter
Mary
(
if
I
must
not
call
her
"
little
"
)
,
and
shaking
hands
with
me
;
but
all
in
a
cheerful
sort
of
manner
,
so
we
thought
nothing
about
her
kisses
and
shakes
.
 
<EOS>
But
on
Wednesday
night
comes
Mrs.
Bradshaw
's
son
 
with
Esther
's
box
,
and
presently
Mrs.
Bradshaw
follows
with
the
key
;
and
when
we
began
to
talk
,
we
found
Esther
told
her
she
was
coming
back
to
live
with
us
,
and
would
pay
her
week
's
money
for
not
giving
notice
;
and
on
Tuesday
night
she
carried
off
a
little
bundle
<EOS>
(
her
best
clothes
were
on
her
back
,
as
I
said
before
)
and
told
Mrs.
Bradshaw
not
to
hurry
herself
about
the
big
box
,
but
bring
it
when
she
had
time
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
of
course
,
she
thought
she
should
find
Esther
with
us
;
and
when
she
told
her
story
,
my
missis
set
up
such
a
screech
,
and
fell
down
in
a
dead
swoon
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
ran
up
with
water
for
her
mother
,
and
I
thought
so
much
about
my
wife
<EOS>
,
I
did
not
seem
to
care
at
all
for
Esther
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
next
day
I
asked
all
the
neighbours
(
both
our
own
and
Bradshaw
's
)
and
<EOS>
they
'd
none
of
'em
heard
or
seen
nothing
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
even
went
to
a
policeman
,
a
good
enough
sort
of
man
,
but
a
fellow
I
'd
never
spoken
to
before
because
of
his
livery
,
and
<EOS>
I
asks
him
if
his
"
cuteness
could
find
anything
out
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
believe
he
asks
other
policemen
;
and
one
on
'em
had
seen
a
wench
,
like
our
Esther
,
walking
very
quickly
,
with
a
bundle
under
her
arm
,
on
Tuesday
night
,
toward
eight
o'clock
,
and
get
into
a
hackney
coach
,
near
Hulme
Church
,
and
we
do
n't
know
th
'
number
,
and
ca
n't
trace
it
no
further
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
enough
for
the
girl
,
for
bad
's
come
over
her
,
one
way
or
another
,
but
I
'm
sorrier
for
my
wife
.
 
<EOS>
She
loved
her
next
to
me
and
Mary
,
and
she
's
never
been
the
same
body
since
poor
Tom
's
death
.
<EOS>
However
,
let
's
go
back
to
them
;
your
old
woman
may
have
done
her
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
they
walked
homewards
with
a
brisker
pace
,
Wilson
expressed
a
wish
that
they
still
were
the
near
neighbours
they
once
had
been
.
  
<EOS>
"
Still
our
Alice
lives
in
the
cellar
under
No
.
14
,
in
Barber
Street
,
and
if
you
'd
only
speak
the
word
she
'd
be
with
you
in
five
minutes
to
keep
your
wife
company
when
she
's
lonesome
.
 
<EOS>
Though
I
'm
Alice
's
brother
,
and
perhaps
ought
not
to
say
it
,
I
will
say
there
's
none
more
ready
to
help
with
heart
or
hand
than
she
is
.
 
<EOS>
Though
she
may
have
done
a
hard
day
's
wash
,
there
's
not
a
child
ill
within
the
street
,
but
Alice
goes
to
offer
to
sit
up
,
and
does
sit
up
,
too
,
though
may
be
<EOS>
she
's
to
be
at
her
work
by
six
next
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
poor
woman
,
and
can
feel
for
the
poor
,
Wilson
,
"
was
Barton
's
reply
;
and
then
he
added
,
"
Thank
you
kindly
for
your
offer
,
and
mayhap
I
may
trouble
her
to
be
a
bit
with
my
wife
,
for
while
I
'm
at
work
,
and
Mary
's
at
school
,
I
know
she
frets
above
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
See
,
there
's
Mary
!
"
and
the
father
's
eye
brightened
,
as
in
the
distance
,
among
a
group
of
girls
,
he
spied
his
only
daughter
,
a
bonny
lass
of
thirteen
or
so
,
who
came
bounding
along
to
meet
and
to
greet
her
father
,
in
a
manner
that
showed
that
the
stern
-
looking
man
had
a
tender
nature
within
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
men
had
crossed
the
last
stile
,
while
Mary
loitered
behind
to
gather
some
buds
of
the
coming
hawthorn
,
when
an
overgrown
lad
came
past
her
,
and
snatched
a
kiss
,
exclaiming
,
"
For
old
acquaintance
sake
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
that
for
old
acquaintance
sake
,
then
,
"
said
the
girl
,
blushing
rosy
red
,
more
with
anger
than
shame
,
as
she
slapped
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
The
tones
of
her
voice
called
back
her
father
and
his
friend
,
and
the
aggressor
proved
to
be
the
eldest
son
of
the
latter
,
the
senior
by
eighteen
years
of
his
little
brothers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
children
,
instead
o
'
kissing
and
quarrelling
,
do
ye
each
take
a
baby
,
for
if
Wilson
's
arms
be
like
mine
they
are
heartily
tired
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
sprang
forward
to
take
her
father
's
charge
,
with
a
girl
's
fondness
for
infants
,
and
with
some
little
foresight
of
the
event
soon
to
happen
at
home
;
while
young
Wilson
seemed
to
lose
his
rough
,
cubbish
nature
as
he
crowed
and
cooed
to
his
little
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Twins
is
a
great
trial
to
a
poor
man
,
bless
'
em
,
"
said
the
half
-
proud
,
half
-
weary
father
,
as
he
bestowed
a
smacking
kiss
on
the
babe
ere
he
parted
with
it
.

A
MANCHESTER
TEA
-
PARTY
.
 
<EOS>
"
Polly
,
put
the
kettle
on
,
 
And
let
's
have
tea
!
 
<EOS>
Polly
,
put
the
kettle
on
,
 
<EOS>
And
we
'll
all
have
tea
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
we
are
,
wife
;
did'st
thou
think
thou'd
lost
us
?
"
<EOS>
quoth
hearty
-
voiced
Wilson
,
as
the
two
women
rose
and
shook
themselves
in
preparation
for
their
homeward
walk
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Barton
was
evidently
soothed
,
if
not
cheered
,
by
the
unburdening
of
her
fears
and
thoughts
to
her
friend
;
and
her
approving
look
went
far
to
second
her
husband
's
invitation
that
the
whole
party
should
adjourn
from
Green
Heys
Fields
to
tea
,
at
the
Bartons
'
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
faint
opposition
was
raised
by
Mrs.
Wilson
,
on
account
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
at
which
they
would
probably
return
,
which
she
feared
on
her
babies
'
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
hold
your
tongue
,
missis
,
will
you
,
"
said
her
husband
good
-
temperedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
know
them
brats
never
goes
to
sleep
till
long
past
ten
?
<EOS>
and
have
n't
you
a
shawl
,
under
which
you
can
tuck
one
lad
's
head
,
as
safe
as
a
bird
's
under
its
wing
?
 
<EOS>
And
as
for
t'other
one
,
I
'll
put
it
in
my
pocket
rather
than
not
stay
,
now
we
are
this
far
away
from
Ancoats
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Or
,
I
can
lend
you
another
shawl
,
"
suggested
Mrs.
Barton
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
anything
rather
than
not
stay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
matter
being
decided
the
party
proceeded
home
,
through
many
half
-
finished
streets
,
all
so
like
one
another
,
that
you
might
have
easily
been
bewildered
and
lost
your
way
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
step
,
however
,
did
our
friends
lose
;
down
this
entry
,
cutting
off
that
corner
,
until
they
turned
out
of
one
of
these
innumerable
streets
into
a
little
paved
court
,
having
the
backs
of
houses
at
the
end
opposite
to
the
opening
,
and
a
gutter
running
through
the
middle
to
carry
off
household
slops
,
washing
suds
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
The
women
who
lived
in
the
court
were
busy
taking
in
strings
of
caps
,
frocks
,
and
various
articles
of
linen
,
which
hung
from
side
to
side
,
dangling
so
low
,
that
if
our
friends
had
been
a
few
minutes
'
sooner
,
they
would
have
had
to
stoop
very
much
,
or
else
the
half
-
wet
clothes
would
have
flapped
in
their
faces
:
but
although
the
evening
seemed
yet
early
when
they
were
in
the
open
fields
 
among
the
pent
-
up
houses
,
night
,
with
its
mists
and
its
darkness
,
had
already
begun
to
fall
.
  
<EOS>
Many
greetings
were
given
and
exchanged
between
the
Wilsons
and
these
women
,
for
not
long
ago
they
had
also
dwelt
in
this
court
.
  
<EOS>
Two
rude
lads
,
standing
at
a
disorderly
looking
house
-
door
,
exclaimed
,
as
Mary
Barton
(
the
daughter
)
passed
,
"
Eh
,
look
!
<EOS>
Polly
Barton
's
getten
*
<EOS>
a
sweetheart
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
Of
course
this
referred
to
young
Wilson
,
who
stole
a
look
to
see
how
Mary
took
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
her
assume
the
air
of
a
young
fury
,
and
to
his
next
speech
she
answered
not
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Barton
produced
the
key
of
the
door
from
her
pocket
;
and
on
entering
the
house
-
place
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
in
total
darkness
,
except
one
bright
spot
,
which
might
be
a
cat
's
eye
,
or
might
be
,
what
it
was
,
a
red
-
hot
fire
,
smouldering
under
a
large
piece
of
coal
,
which
John
Barton
immediately
applied
himself
to
break
up
,
and
the
effect
instantly
produced
was
warm
and
glowing
light
in
every
corner
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
To
add
to
this
(
although
the
coarse
yellow
glare
seemed
lost
in
the
ruddy
glow
from
the
fire
)
,
Mrs.
Barton
lighted
a
dip
by
sticking
it
in
the
fire
,
and
having
placed
it
satisfactorily
in
a
tin
candlestick
,
began
to
look
further
about
her
,
on
hospitable
thoughts
intent
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
was
tolerably
large
,
and
possessed
many
conveniences
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
right
of
the
door
,
as
you
entered
,
was
a
longish
window
,
with
a
broad
ledge
.
 
<EOS>
On
each
side
of
this
,
hung
blue
-
and
-
white
check
curtains
,
which
were
now
drawn
,
to
shut
in
the
friends
met
to
enjoy
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Two
geraniums
,
unpruned
and
leafy
,
which
stood
on
the
sill
,
formed
a
further
defence
from
out
-
door
pryers
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
corner
between
the
window
<EOS>
and
the
fireside
was
a
cupboard
,
apparently
full
of
plates
and
dishes
,
cups
and
saucers
,
and
<EOS>
some
more
nondescript
articles
,
for
which
one
would
have
fancied
their
possessors
could
find
no
use
 
such
as
triangular
pieces
of
glass
to
save
carving
knives
and
forks
from
dirtying
table
-
cloths
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
it
was
evident
<EOS>
Mrs.
Barton
was
proud
of
her
crockery
and
glass
,
for
she
left
her
cupboard
door
open
,
with
a
glance
round
of
satisfaction
and
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
opposite
side
to
the
door
and
window
was
the
staircase
,
and
two
doors
;
one
of
which
(
the
nearest
to
the
fire
)
led
into
a
sort
of
little
back
kitchen
,
where
dirty
work
,
such
as
washing
up
dishes
,
might
be
done
,
and
whose
shelves
served
as
larder
,
and
pantry
,
and
storeroom
,
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
door
,
which
was
considerably
lower
,
opened
into
the
coal
-
hole
 
the
slanting
closet
under
the
stairs
;
from
which
,
to
the
fire
-
place
,
there
was
a
gay
-
coloured
piece
of
oil
-
cloth
laid
.
 
<EOS>
The
place
seemed
almost
crammed
with
furniture
(
sure
sign
of
good
times
among
the
mills
)
.
 
<EOS>
Beneath
the
window
was
a
dresser
,
with
three
deep
drawers
.
 
<EOS>
Opposite
the
fire
-
place
was
a
table
,
which
I
should
call
a
Pembroke
,
only
that
it
was
made
of
deal
,
and
I
can
not
tell
how
far
such
a
name
may
be
applied
to
such
humble
material
.
 
<EOS>
On
it
,
resting
against
the
wall
,
was
a
bright
green
japanned
tea
-
tray
,
having
a
couple
of
scarlet
lovers
embracing
in
the
middle
.
 
<EOS>
The
fire
-
light
danced
merrily
on
this
,
and
really
(
setting
all
taste
but
<EOS>
that
of
a
child
's
aside
)
<EOS>
it
gave
a
richness
of
colouring
to
that
side
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
some
measure
propped
up
by
a
crimson
tea
-
caddy
,
also
of
japan
ware
.
 
<EOS>
A
round
table
on
one
branching
leg
,
really
for
use
,
stood
in
the
corresponding
corner
to
the
cupboard
;
and
,
if
you
can
picture
all
this
,
with
a
washy
,
but
clean
stencilled
pattern
on
the
walls
,
you
can
form
some
idea
of
John
Barton
's
home
.
  
<EOS>
The
tray
was
soon
hoisted
down
,
and
before
the
merry
clatter
of
cups
and
saucers
began
,
the
women
disburdened
themselves
of
their
out
-
of
-
door
things
,
and
sent
Mary
upstairs
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
a
long
whispering
,
and
chinking
of
money
,
to
which
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Wilson
were
too
polite
to
attend
;
knowing
,
as
they
did
full
well
,
that
it
all
related
to
the
preparations
for
hospitality
;
hospitality
that
,
in
their
turn
,
they
should
have
such
pleasure
in
offering
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
tried
to
be
busily
occupied
with
the
children
,
and
not
to
hear
Mrs.
Barton
's
directions
to
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Run
,
Mary
,
dear
,
just
round
the
corner
,
and
get
some
fresh
eggs
at
Tipping
's
(
you
may
get
one
apiece
,
that
will
be
fivepence
)
,
and
see
if
he
has
any
nice
ham
cut
,
that
he
would
let
us
have
a
pound
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
two
pounds
,
missis
,
and
do
n't
be
stingy
,
"
chimed
in
the
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
a
pound
and
a
half
,
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
And
get
it
<EOS>
Cumberland
ham
,
for
Wilson
comes
from
there
-
away
,
and
it
will
have
a
sort
of
relish
of
home
with
it
<EOS>
he
'll
like
,
 
and
Mary
"
<EOS>
(
seeing
the
lassie
fain
to
be
off
)
,
"
you
must
get
a
pennyworth
of
milk
and
a
loaf
of
bread
 
<EOS>
mind
you
get
it
fresh
and
new
 
and
,
and
 
that
's
all
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
's
not
all
,
"
said
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
must
get
sixpennyworth
of
rum
,
to
warm
the
tea
;
thou'll
get
it
at
the
"
Grapes
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
thou
just
go
to
Alice
Wilson
;
he
says
she
lives
just
right
round
the
corner
,
<EOS>
under
14
,
Barber
Street
"
(
this
was
addressed
to
his
wife
)
;
"
and
tell
her
to
come
and
take
her
tea
with
us
;
she
'll
like
to
see
her
brother
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
let
alone
<EOS>
Jane
and
the
twins
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
she
comes
she
must
bring
a
tea
-
cup
and
saucer
,
for
we
have
but
half
-
a
-
dozen
,
and
here
's
six
of
us
,
"
said
Mrs.
Barton
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
,
pooh
,
Jem
and
Mary
can
drink
out
of
one
,
surely
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Mary
secretly
determined
to
take
care
that
Alice
brought
her
tea
-
cup
and
saucer
,
if
the
alternative
was
to
be
her
sharing
anything
with
Jem
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
Wilson
had
but
just
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
out
all
day
in
the
fields
,
gathering
wild
herbs
for
drinks
and
medicine
,
for
in
addition
to
her
invaluable
qualities
as
a
sick
nurse
and
her
worldly
occupations
as
a
washerwoman
,
she
added
a
considerable
knowledge
of
hedge
and
field
simples
;
and
on
fine
days
,
when
no
more
profitable
occupation
offered
itself
,
she
used
to
ramble
off
into
the
lanes
and
meadows
as
far
as
her
legs
could
carry
her
.
 
<EOS>
This
evening
she
had
returned
loaded
with
nettles
,
and
her
first
object
was
to
light
a
candle
and
see
to
hang
them
up
in
bunches
in
every
available
place
in
her
cellar
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
perfection
of
cleanliness
;
in
one
corner
stood
the
modest
-
looking
bed
,
with
a
check
curtain
at
the
head
,
the
whitewashed
wall
filling
up
the
place
where
the
corresponding
one
should
have
been
.
 
<EOS>
The
floor
was
bricked
,
and
scrupulously
clean
,
although
so
damp
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
last
washing
would
never
dry
up
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
cellar
window
looked
into
an
area
in
the
street
,
down
which
boys
might
throw
stones
,
it
was
protected
by
an
outside
shutter
,
and
was
oddly
festooned
with
all
manner
of
hedge
-
row
,
ditch
,
and
field
plants
,
which
we
are
accustomed
to
call
valueless
,
but
which
have
a
powerful
effect
either
for
good
or
for
evil
,
and
are
consequently
much
used
among
the
poor
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
was
strewed
,
hung
,
and
darkened
with
these
bunches
,
which
emitted
no
very
fragrant
odour
in
their
process
of
drying
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
corner
was
a
sort
of
broad
hanging
shelf
,
made
of
old
planks
,
where
some
old
hoards
of
Alice
's
were
kept
.
 
<EOS>
Her
little
bit
of
crockery
-
ware
was
ranged
on
the
mantelpiece
,
where
also
stood
her
candlestick
and
box
of
matches
.
 
<EOS>
A
small
cupboard
contained
at
the
bottom
coals
,
and
at
the
top
her
bread
and
basin
of
oatmeal
,
her
frying
-
pan
,
teapot
,
and
a
small
tin
saucepan
,
which
served
as
a
kettle
,
as
well
as
for
cooking
the
delicate
little
messes
of
broth
which
Alice
was
sometimes
able
to
manufacture
for
a
sick
neighbour
.
  
<EOS>
After
her
walk
she
felt
chilly
and
weary
,
and
was
busy
trying
to
light
her
fire
with
the
damp
coals
,
and
half
-
green
sticks
,
when
Mary
knocked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
"
said
Alice
,
remembering
,
however
,
that
she
had
barred
the
door
for
the
night
,
and
hastening
to
make
it
possible
for
any
one
to
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
you
,
Mary
Barton
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
she
,
as
the
light
from
the
candle
streamed
on
the
girl
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
you
are
grown
since
I
used
to
see
you
at
my
brother
's
!
 
<EOS>
Come
in
,
lass
,
come
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Please
,
"
said
Mary
,
almost
breathless
,
<EOS>
"
mother
says
you
're
to
come
to
tea
,
and
bring
your
cup
and
saucer
,
for
George
and
Jane
Wilson
is
with
us
,
and
the
twins
,
and
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
're
to
make
haste
,
please
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
it
's
very
neighbourly
and
kind
in
your
mother
,
and
I
'll
come
,
with
many
thanks
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
,
Mary
,
has
your
mother
got
any
nettles
for
spring
drink
?
 
<EOS>
If
she
has
n't
,
I
'll
take
her
some
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
n't
think
she
has
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
ran
off
like
a
hare
to
fulfil
what
,
to
a
girl
of
thirteen
,
fond
of
power
,
was
the
more
interesting
part
of
her
errand
 
<EOS>
the
money
-
spending
part
.
 
<EOS>
And
well
and
ably
did
she
perform
her
business
,
returning
home
with
a
little
bottle
of
rum
,
and
the
eggs
in
one
hand
,
while
her
other
was
filled
with
some
excellent
red
-
and
-
white
,
smoke
-
flavoured
,
Cumberland
ham
,
wrapped
up
in
paper
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
at
home
,
and
frying
ham
,
before
Alice
had
chosen
her
nettles
,
put
out
her
candle
,
locked
her
door
,
and
walked
in
a
very
foot
-
sore
manner
as
far
as
John
Barton
's
.
 
<EOS>
What
an
aspect
of
comfort
did
his
house
-
place
present
,
after
her
humble
cellar
!
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
think
of
comparing
;
but
for
all
that
she
felt
the
delicious
glow
of
the
fire
,
the
bright
light
that
revelled
in
every
corner
of
the
room
,
the
savoury
smells
,
the
comfortable
sounds
of
a
boiling
kettle
,
and
the
hissing
,
frizzling
ham
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
little
old
-
fashioned
curtsey
she
shut
the
door
,
and
replied
with
a
loving
heart
to
the
boisterous
and
surprised
greeting
of
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
all
preparations
being
made
,
the
party
sat
down
;
Mrs.
Wilson
in
the
post
of
honour
,
the
rocking
-
chair
,
on
the
right
-
hand
side
of
the
fire
,
nursing
her
baby
,
while
its
father
,
in
an
opposite
arm
-
chair
,
tried
vainly
to
quiet
the
other
with
bread
soaked
in
milk
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Barton
knew
manners
too
well
to
do
anything
but
sit
at
the
tea
-
table
and
make
tea
,
though
in
her
heart
she
longed
to
be
able
to
superintend
the
frying
of
the
ham
,
and
cast
many
an
anxious
look
at
Mary
as
she
broke
the
eggs
and
turned
the
ham
,
with
a
very
comfortable
portion
of
confidence
in
her
own
culinary
powers
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
stood
awkwardly
leaning
against
the
dresser
,
replying
rather
gruffly
to
his
aunt
's
speeches
,
which
gave
him
,
he
thought
,
the
air
of
being
a
little
boy
;
whereas
he
considered
himself
as
a
young
man
,
and
not
so
very
young
neither
,
as
in
two
months
he
would
be
eighteen
.
<EOS>
Barton
vibrated
between
the
fire
and
the
tea
-
table
,
his
only
drawback
being
a
fancy
that
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
his
wife
's
face
flushed
and
contracted
as
if
in
pain
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
the
business
actually
began
.
 
<EOS>
Knives
and
forks
,
cups
and
saucers
made
a
noise
,
but
human
voices
were
still
,
for
human
beings
were
hungry
and
had
no
time
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
first
broke
silence
;
holding
her
tea
-
cup
with
the
manner
of
one
proposing
a
toast
,
she
said
,
"
Here
's
to
absent
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Friends
may
meet
,
but
mountains
never
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
an
unlucky
toast
or
sentiment
,
as
she
instantly
felt
.
 
<EOS>
Every
one
thought
of
Esther
,
the
absent
Esther
;
and
Mrs.
Barton
put
down
her
food
,
and
could
not
hide
the
fast
-
dropping
tears
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
could
have
bitten
her
tongue
out
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
wet
blanket
to
the
evening
;
for
though
all
had
been
said
and
suggested
in
the
fields
that
could
be
said
or
suggested
,
every
one
had
a
wish
to
say
something
in
the
way
of
comfort
to
poor
Mrs.
Barton
,
and
a
dislike
to
talk
about
anything
else
while
her
tears
fell
fast
and
scalding
.
 
<EOS>
So
George
Wilson
,
his
wife
,
and
children
set
off
early
home
,
not
before
(
in
spite
of
mal
-
a
-
propos
speeches
)
<EOS>
they
had
expressed
a
wish
that
such
meetings
might
often
take
place
,
and
not
before
John
Barton
had
given
his
hearty
consent
;
and
declared
that
as
soon
as
ever
his
wife
was
well
again
they
would
have
just
such
another
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
care
not
to
come
and
spoil
it
,
"
thought
poor
Alice
,
and
going
up
to
Mrs.
Barton
<EOS>
,
she
took
her
hand
almost
humbly
,
and
said
,
"
You
do
n't
know
how
sorry
I
am
<EOS>
I
said
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
her
surprise
,
a
surprise
that
brought
tears
of
joy
into
her
eyes
,
Mary
Barton
put
her
arms
round
her
neck
,
and
kissed
the
self
-
reproaching
Alice
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
mean
any
harm
,
and
it
was
me
as
was
so
foolish
;
only
this
work
about
Esther
,
and
not
knowing
where
she
is
,
lies
so
heavy
on
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
night

never

no

about
it

God

Many
and
many
a
time
,
as
Alice
reviewed
that
evening
in
her
after
life
,
did
she
bless
Mary
Barton
for
these
kind
and
thoughtful
words
.
<EOS>
But
just
then
all
she
could
say
was
,
"
Good
-
night
,
Mary
,
and
may
God
bless
YOU

JOHN
BARTONS
GREAT
TROUBLE
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
when
the
morn
came
dim
and
sad
,
And
chill
with
early
showers
,
Her
quiet
eyelids
closed
 
she
had
Another
morn
than
ours
.
"
 
HOOD
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
middle
of
that
same
night
a
neighbour
of
the
Bartons
was
roused
from
her
sound
,
well
-
earned
sleep
,
by
a
knocking
,
which
had
at
first
made
part
of
her
dream
;
but
starting
up
,
as
soon
as
she
became
convinced
of
its
reality
,
she
opened
the
window
,
and
asked
who
was
there
?
  
<EOS>
"
Me
 
John
Barton
,
"
answered
he
,
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
My
missis
is
in
labour
,
and
,
for
the
love
of
God
,
step
in
while
I
run
for
th
'
doctor
,
for
she
's
fearful
bad
.
"
  
<EOS>
While
the
woman
hastily
dressed
herself
,
leaving
the
window
still
open
,
she
heard
the
cries
of
agony
,
which
resounded
in
the
little
court
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
In
less
than
five
minutes
she
was
standing
by
Mrs.
Barton
's
bedside
,
relieving
the
terrified
Mary
,
who
went
about
where
she
was
told
like
an
automaton
<EOS>
;
her
eyes
tearless
,
her
face
calm
,
though
deadly
pale
,
and
uttering
no
sound
,
except
when
her
teeth
chattered
for
very
nervousness
.
  
<EOS>
The
cries
grew
worse
.
  
<EOS>
The
doctor
was
very
long
in
hearing
the
repeated
rings
at
his
night
-
bell
,
and
still
longer
in
understanding
who
it
was
that
made
this
sudden
call
upon
his
services
;
and
then
he
begged
Barton
just
to
wait
while
he
dressed
himself
,
in
order
that
no
time
might
be
lost
in
finding
the
court
and
house
.
 
<EOS>
Barton
absolutely
stamped
with
impatience
,
outside
the
doctor
's
door
,
before
he
came
down
;
and
walked
so
fast
homewards
,
that
the
medical
man
several
times
asked
him
to
go
slower
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
so
very
bad
?
"
asked
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Worse
,
much
worser
than
I
ever
saw
her
before
,
"
replied
John
.
  
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
she
was
not
 
she
was
at
peace
.
 
<EOS>
The
cries
were
still
for
ever
.
<EOS>
John
had
no
time
for
listening
.
 
<EOS>
He
opened
the
latched
door
,
stayed
not
to
light
a
candle
for
the
mere
ceremony
of
showing
his
companion
up
the
stairs
,
so
well
known
to
himself
;
but
,
in
two
minutes
,
was
in
the
room
,
where
lay
the
dead
wife
,
whom
he
had
loved
with
all
the
power
of
his
strong
heart
.
 
<EOS>
The
doctor
stumbled
upstairs
by
the
fire
-
light
,
and
met
the
awe
-
struck
look
of
the
neighbour
,
which
at
once
told
him
the
state
of
things
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
was
still
,
as
he
,
with
habitual
tiptoe
step
,
approached
the
poor
frail
body
,
that
nothing
now
could
more
disturb
.
 
<EOS>
Her
daughter
knelt
by
the
bedside
,
her
face
buried
in
the
clothes
,
which
were
almost
crammed
into
her
mouth
,
to
keep
down
the
choking
sobs
.
 
<EOS>
The
husband
stood
like
one
stupefied
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
questioned
the
neighbour
in
whispers
,
and
then
approaching
Barton
,
said
,
"
You
must
go
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
great
shock
,
but
bear
it
like
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
Go
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
went
mechanically
and
sat
down
on
the
first
chair
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
hope
.
 
<EOS>
The
look
of
death
was
too
clear
upon
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
when
he
heard
one
or
two
unusual
noises
,
the
thought
burst
on
him
that
it
might
only
be
a
trance
,
a
fit
<EOS>
,
a
 
he
did
not
well
know
what
 
but
not
death
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
not
death
!
 
<EOS>
And
he
was
starting
up
to
go
up
-
stairs
again
,
when
the
doctor
's
heavy
cautious
creaking
footstep
was
heard
on
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
knew
what
it
really
was
in
the
chamber
above
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
could
have
saved
her
 
there
has
been
some
shock
to
the
system
"
 
a
nd
<EOS>
so
he
went
on
,
but
to
unheeding
ears
,
which
yet
retained
his
words
to
ponder
on
;
words
not
for
immediate
use
in
conveying
sense
,
but
to
be
laid
by
,
in
the
store
-
house
of
memory
,
for
a
more
convenient
season
.
 
<EOS>
The
doctor
,
seeing
the
state
of
the
case
,
grieved
for
the
man
;
and
,
very
sleepy
,
thought
it
best
to
go
,
and
accordingly
wished
him
good
-
night
 
<EOS>
but
there
was
no
answer
,
so
he
let
himself
out
;
and
Barton
sat
on
,
like
a
stock
or
a
stone
,
so
rigid
,
so
still
.
 
<EOS>
He
heard
the
sounds
above
,
too
,
and
knew
what
they
meant
.
 
<EOS>
He
heard
the
stiff
unseasoned
drawer
,
in
which
his
wife
kept
her
clothes
,
pulled
open
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
the
neighbour
come
down
,
and
blunder
about
in
search
of
soap
and
water
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
well
what
she
wanted
,
and
WHY
she
wanted
them
,
but
he
did
not
speak
nor
offer
to
help
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
she
went
,
with
some
kindly
meant
words
(
a
text
of
comfort
,
which
fell
upon
a
deafened
ear
)
,
and
something
about
"
Mary
,
"
but
which
Mary
,
in
his
bewildered
state
,
he
could
not
tell
.
  
<EOS>
He
tried
to
realise
it
 
to
think
it
possible
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
his
mind
wandered
off
to
other
days
,
to
far
different
times
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
of
their
courtship
;
of
his
first
seeing
her
,
an
awkward
beautiful
rustic
,
far
too
shiftless
for
the
delicate
factory
work
to
which
she
was
apprenticed
;
of
his
first
gift
to
her
,
a
bead
necklace
,
which
had
long
ago
been
put
by
,
in
one
of
the
deep
drawers
of
the
dresser
,
to
be
kept
for
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
He
wondered
if
it
was
there
yet
,
and
with
a
strange
curiosity
he
got
up
to
feel
for
it
;
for
the
fire
by
this
time
was
well
nigh
out
,
and
candle
he
had
none
.
 
<EOS>
His
groping
hand
fell
on
the
piled
-
up
tea
-
things
,
which
at
his
desire
she
had
left
unwashed
till
morning
 
they
were
all
so
tired
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
reminded
of
one
of
the
daily
little
actions
,
which
acquire
such
power
when
they
have
been
performed
for
the
last
time
by
one
we
love
.
 
<EOS>
He
began
to
think
over
his
wife
's
daily
round
of
duties
:
and
something
in
the
remembrance
that
these
would
never
more
be
done
by
her
,
touched
the
source
of
tears
,
and
he
cried
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Mary
,
meanwhile
,
had
mechanically
helped
the
neighbour
in
all
the
last
attentions
to
the
dead
;
and
when
she
was
kissed
and
spoken
to
soothingly
,
tears
stole
quietly
down
her
cheeks
;
but
she
reserved
the
luxury
of
a
full
burst
of
grief
till
she
should
be
alone
.
 
<EOS>
She
shut
the
chamber
-
door
softly
,
after
the
neighbour
was
gone
,
and
then
shook
the
bed
by
which
she
knelt
with
her
agony
of
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
She
repeated
,
over
and
over
again
,
<EOS>
the
same
words
;
the
same
vain
,
unanswered
address
to
her
who
was
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mother
!
<EOS>
mother
,
are
you
really
dead
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
mother
,
mother
!
"
  
<EOS>
At
last
she
stopped
,
because
it
flashed
across
her
mind
that
her
violence
of
grief
might
disturb
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
All
was
still
below
.
<EOS>
She
looked
on
the
face
so
changed
,
and
yet
so
strangely
like
.
 
<EOS>
She
bent
down
to
kiss
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
cold
unyielding
flesh
struck
a
shudder
to
her
heart
,
and
hastily
obeying
her
impulse
,
she
grasped
the
candle
,
and
opened
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
heard
the
sobs
of
her
father
's
grief
;
and
quickly
,
quietly
stealing
down
the
steps
,
she
knelt
by
him
,
and
kissed
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
no
notice
at
first
;
for
his
burst
of
grief
would
not
be
controlled
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
her
shriller
sobs
,
her
terrified
cries
(
which
she
could
not
repress
)
,
rose
upon
his
ear
,
he
checked
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Child
,
we
must
be
all
to
one
another
,
now
SHE
is
gone
,
"
whispered
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
father
,
what
can
I
do
for
you
?
 
<EOS>
Do
tell
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
do
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
thou
wilt
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
must
not
fret
thyself
ill
<EOS>
,
that
's
the
first
thing
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
must
leave
me
and
go
to
bed
now
,
like
a
good
girl
as
thou
art
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Leave
you
,
father
!
<EOS>
oh
,
do
n't
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
but
thou
must
:
thou
must
go
to
bed
,
and
try
and
sleep
;
thou'lt
have
enough
to
do
and
to
bear
,
poor
wench
,
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
Mary
got
up
,
kissed
her
father
,
and
sadly
went
upstairs
to
the
little
closet
,
where
she
slept
.
 
<EOS>
She
thought
it
was
of
no
use
undressing
,
for
that
she
could
never
,
never
sleep
<EOS>
,
so
threw
herself
on
her
bed
in
her
clothes
,
and
before
ten
minutes
had
passed
away
,
the
passionate
grief
of
youth
had
subsided
into
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
Barton
had
been
roused
by
his
daughter
's
entrance
,
both
from
his
stupor
and
from
his
uncontrollable
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
think
on
what
was
to
be
done
,
could
plan
for
the
funeral
,
could
calculate
the
necessity
of
soon
returning
to
his
work
,
as
the
extravagance
of
the
past
night
would
leave
them
short
of
money
if
he
long
remained
away
from
the
mill
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
a
club
,
so
that
money
was
provided
for
the
burial
.
 
<EOS>
These
things
settled
in
his
own
mind
,
he
recalled
the
doctor
's
words
,
and
bitterly
thought
of
the
shock
his
poor
wife
had
so
recently
had
,
in
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
her
cherished
sister
.
 
<EOS>
His
feelings
towards
Esther
almost
amounted
to
curses
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
she
who
had
brought
on
all
this
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
Her
giddiness
,
her
lightness
of
conduct
had
wrought
this
woe
.
 
<EOS>
His
previous
thoughts
about
her
had
been
tinged
with
wonder
and
pity
,
but
now
he
hardened
his
heart
against
her
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
the
good
influences
over
John
Barton
's
life
had
departed
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
ties
which
bound
him
down
to
the
gentle
humanities
of
earth
was
loosened
,
and
henceforward
the
neighbours
all
remarked
he
was
a
changed
man
.
 
<EOS>
His
gloom
and
his
sternness
became
habitual
instead
of
occasional
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
more
obstinate
.
 
<EOS>
But
never
to
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
Between
the
father
and
the
daughter
there
existed
in
full
force
that
mysterious
bond
which
unites
those
who
have
been
loved
by
one
who
is
now
dead
and
gone
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
harsh
and
silent
to
others
,
he
humoured
Mary
with
tender
love
:
she
had
more
of
her
own
way
than
is
common
in
any
rank
with
girls
of
her
age
.
<EOS>
Part
of
this
was
the
necessity
of
the
case
;
for
of
course
all
the
money
went
through
her
hands
,
and
the
household
arrangements
were
guided
by
her
will
and
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
But
part
was
her
father
's
indulgence
,
for
he
left
her
,
with
full
trust
in
her
unusual
sense
and
spirit
,
to
choose
her
own
associates
,
and
her
own
times
for
seeing
them
.
  
<EOS>
With
all
this
,
Mary
had
not
her
father
's
confidence
in
the
matters
which
now
began
to
occupy
him
,
heart
and
soul
;
she
was
aware
that
he
had
joined
clubs
,
and
become
an
active
member
of
the
Trades
'
Union
,
but
it
was
hardly
likely
that
a
girl
of
Mary
's
age
(
even
when
two
or
three
years
had
elapsed
since
her
mother
's
death
)
should
care
much
for
the
differences
between
the
employers
and
the
employed
 
an
eternal
subject
for
agitation
in
the
manufacturing
districts
,
which
,
however
it
may
be
lulled
for
a
time
,
is
sure
to
break
forth
again
with
fresh
violence
at
any
depression
of
trade
,
showing
that
in
its
apparent
quiet
,
the
ashes
had
still
smouldered
in
the
breasts
of
a
few
.
  
<EOS>
Among
these
few
was
John
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
times
it
is
a
bewildering
thing
to
the
poor
weaver
to
see
his
employer
removing
from
house
to
house
,
<EOS>
each
one
grander
than
the
last
,
till
he
ends
in
building
one
more
magnificent
than
all
,
or
withdraws
his
money
from
the
concern
,
or
sells
his
mill
,
to
buy
an
estate
in
the
country
,
while
all
the
time
the
weaver
,
who
thinks
he
and
his
fellows
are
the
real
makers
of
this
wealth
,
is
struggling
on
for
bread
for
his
children
,
through
the
vicissitudes
of
lowered
wages
,
short
hours
,
fewer
hands
employed
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
he
knows
trade
is
bad
,
and
could
understand
(
at
least
partially
)
that
there
are
not
buyers
enough
in
the
market
to
purchase
the
goods
already
made
,
and
consequently
that
there
is
no
demand
for
more
;
when
he
would
bear
and
endure
much
without
complaining
<EOS>
,
could
he
also
see
that
his
employers
were
bearing
their
share
;
he
is
,
I
say
,
bewildered
and
(
to
use
his
own
word
)
"
aggravated
"
to
see
that
all
goes
on
just
as
usual
with
the
millowners
.
 
<EOS>
Large
houses
are
still
occupied
,
while
spinners
'
and
weavers
'
cottages
stand
empty
,
because
the
families
that
once
filled
them
are
obliged
to
live
in
rooms
or
cellars
.
 
<EOS>
Carriages
still
roll
along
the
streets
,
concerts
are
still
crowded
by
subscribers
,
the
shops
for
expensive
luxuries
still
find
daily
customers
,
while
the
workman
loiters
away
his
unemployed
time
in
watching
these
things
,
and
thinking
of
the
pale
,
uncomplaining
wife
at
home
,
and
the
wailing
children
asking
in
vain
for
enough
of
food
 
of
the
sinking
health
,
of
the
dying
life
of
those
near
and
dear
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
contrast
is
too
great
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
he
alone
suffer
from
bad
times
?
  
<EOS>
I
know
that
this
is
not
really
the
case
;
and
I
know
what
is
the
truth
in
such
matters
;
but
what
I
wish
to
impress
is
what
the
workman
feels
and
thinks
.
 
<EOS>
True
,
that
with
child
-
like
improvidence
,
good
times
will
often
dissipate
his
grumbling
,
and
make
him
forget
all
prudence
and
foresight
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
are
earnest
men
among
these
people
,
men
who
have
endured
wrongs
without
complaining
,
but
without
ever
forgetting
or
forgiving
those
whom
(
they
believe
)
have
caused
all
this
woe
.
  
<EOS>
Among
these
was
John
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
His
parents
had
suffered
;
his
mother
had
died
from
absolute
want
of
the
necessaries
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
himself
was
a
good
,
steady
workman
,
and
,
as
such
,
pretty
certain
of
steady
employment
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
spent
all
he
got
with
the
confidence
<EOS>
(
you
may
also
call
it
improvidence
)
of
one
who
was
willing
,
and
believed
himself
able
,
to
supply
all
his
wants
by
his
own
exertions
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
his
master
suddenly
failed
,
and
all
hands
in
the
mill
were
turned
back
,
one
Tuesday
morning
,
with
the
news
that
Mr.
Hunter
had
stopped
,
Barton
had
only
a
few
shillings
to
rely
on
;
but
he
had
good
heart
of
being
employed
at
some
other
mill
,
and
accordingly
,
before
returning
home
,
he
spent
some
hours
in
going
from
factory
to
factory
,
asking
for
work
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
every
mill
was
some
sign
of
depression
of
trade
!
<EOS>
some
were
working
short
hours
,
some
were
turning
off
hands
,
and
for
weeks
Barton
was
out
of
work
,
living
on
credit
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
during
this
time
that
his
little
son
,
the
apple
of
his
eye
,
the
cynosure
of
all
his
strong
power
of
love
,
fell
ill
of
the
scarlet
fever
.
 
<EOS>
They
dragged
him
through
the
crisis
,
but
his
life
hung
on
a
gossamer
thread
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
,
the
doctor
said
,
depended
on
good
nourishment
,
on
generous
living
,
to
keep
up
the
little
fellow
's
strength
,
in
the
prostration
in
which
the
fever
had
left
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mocking
words
!
<EOS>
when
the
commonest
food
in
the
house
would
not
furnish
one
little
meal
.
 
<EOS>
Barton
tried
credit
;
but
it
was
worn
out
at
the
little
provision
shops
,
which
were
now
suffering
in
their
turn
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
it
would
be
no
sin
to
steal
,
and
would
have
stolen
;
but
he
could
not
get
the
opportunity
in
the
few
days
the
child
lingered
.
 
<EOS>
Hungry
himself
,
almost
to
an
animal
pitch
of
ravenousness
,
but
with
the
bodily
pain
swallowed
up
in
anxiety
for
his
little
sinking
lad
<EOS>
,
he
stood
at
one
of
the
shop
windows
where
all
edible
luxuries
are
displayed
;
haunches
of
venison
,
Stilton
cheeses
,
moulds
of
jelly
 
all
appetising
sights
to
the
common
passer
-
by
.
 
<EOS>
And
out
of
this
shop
came
Mrs.
Hunter
!
 
<EOS>
She
crossed
to
her
carriage
,
followed
by
the
shopman
loaded
with
purchases
for
a
party
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
was
quickly
slammed
to
,
and
she
drove
away
;
and
Barton
returned
home
with
a
bitter
spirit
of
wrath
in
his
heart
to
see
his
only
boy
a
corpse
!
  
<EOS>
You
can
fancy
,
now
,
the
hoards
of
vengeance
in
his
heart
against
the
employers
.
 
<EOS>
For
there
are
never
wanting
those
who
,
either
in
speech
or
in
print
,
find
it
their
interest
to
cherish
such
feelings
in
the
working
classes
;
who
know
how
and
when
to
rouse
the
dangerous
power
at
their
command
;
and
who
use
their
knowledge
with
unrelenting
purpose
to
either
party
.
  
<EOS>
So
while
Mary
took
her
own
way
,
growing
more
spirited
every
day
,
and
growing
in
her
beauty
too
,
her
father
was
chairman
at
many
a
Trades
'
Union
meeting
;
a
friend
of
delegates
,
and
ambitious
of
being
a
delegate
himself
;
a
Chartist
,
and
ready
to
do
anything
for
his
order
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
times
were
good
;
and
all
these
feelings
were
theoretical
,
not
practical
.
 
<EOS>
His
most
practical
thought
was
getting
Mary
apprenticed
to
a
dressmaker
;
for
he
had
never
left
off
disliking
a
factory
life
for
a
girl
,
on
more
accounts
than
one
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
must
do
something
.
 
<EOS>
The
factories
being
,
as
I
said
,
out
of
the
question
,
there
were
two
things
open
 
going
out
to
service
and
the
dressmaking
business
;
and
against
the
first
of
these
,
Mary
set
herself
with
all
the
force
of
her
strong
will
.
 
<EOS>
What
that
will
might
have
been
able
to
achieve
had
her
father
been
against
her
,
I
can
not
tell
;
but
he
disliked
the
idea
of
parting
with
her
,
who
was
the
light
of
his
hearth
;
the
voice
of
his
otherwise
silent
home
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
with
his
ideas
and
feelings
towards
the
higher
classes
,
he
considered
domestic
servitude
as
a
species
of
slavery
;
a
pampering
of
artificial
wants
on
the
one
side
,
a
giving
up
of
every
right
of
leisure
by
day
and
quiet
rest
by
night
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
How
far
his
strong
exaggerated
feelings
had
any
foundation
in
truth
,
it
is
for
you
to
judge
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
that
Mary
's
determination
not
to
go
to
service
arose
from
far
less
sensible
thoughts
on
the
subject
than
her
father
's
.
 
<EOS>
Three
years
of
independence
of
action
(
since
her
mother
's
death
such
a
time
had
now
elapsed
)
had
little
inclined
her
to
submit
to
rules
as
to
hours
and
associates
,
to
regulate
her
dress
by
a
mistress
's
ideas
of
propriety
,
to
lose
the
dear
feminine
privileges
of
gossiping
with
a
merry
neighbour
,
and
working
night
and
day
to
help
one
who
was
sorrowful
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
all
this
,
the
sayings
of
her
absent
,
the
mysterious
aunt
Esther
,
had
an
unacknowledged
influence
over
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
she
was
very
pretty
;
the
factory
people
as
they
poured
from
the
mills
,
and
in
their
freedom
told
the
truth
(
whatever
it
might
be
)
to
every
passer
-
by
,
had
early
let
Mary
into
the
secret
of
her
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
If
their
remarks
had
fallen
on
an
unheeding
ear
,
there
were
always
young
men
enough
,
in
a
different
rank
from
her
own
,
who
were
willing
to
compliment
the
pretty
weaver
's
daughter
as
they
met
her
in
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
trust
a
girl
of
sixteen
for
knowing
it
well
if
she
is
pretty
;
concerning
her
plainness
<EOS>
she
may
be
ignorant
.
 
<EOS>
So
with
this
consciousness
she
had
early
determined
that
her
beauty
should
make
her
a
lady
;
the
rank
she
coveted
the
more
for
her
father
's
abuse
;
the
rank
to
which
she
firmly
believed
her
lost
aunt
<EOS>
Esther
had
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
while
a
servant
must
often
drudge
and
be
dirty
,
must
be
known
as
his
servant
by
all
who
visited
at
her
master
's
house
,
a
dressmaker
's
apprentice
must
(
or
so
Mary
thought
)
<EOS>
be
always
dressed
with
a
certain
regard
to
appearances
;
must
never
soil
her
hands
,
and
need
never
redden
or
dirty
her
face
with
hard
labour
.
 
<EOS>
Before
my
telling
you
so
truly
what
folly
Mary
felt
or
thought
,
injures
her
without
redemption
in
your
opinion
,
think
what
are
the
silly
fancies
of
sixteen
years
of
age
in
every
class
,
and
under
all
circumstances
.
<EOS>
The
end
of
all
the
thoughts
of
father
and
daughter
was
,
as
I
said
before
,
Mary
was
to
be
a
dressmaker
;
and
her
ambition
prompted
her
unwilling
father
to
apply
at
all
the
first
establishments
,
to
know
on
what
terms
of
painstaking
and
zeal
his
daughter
might
be
admitted
into
ever
so
humble
a
workwoman
's
situation
.
 
<EOS>
But
high
premiums
were
asked
at
all
;
poor
man
!
<EOS>
he
might
have
known
that
without
giving
up
a
day
's
work
to
ascertain
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
been
indignant
,
indeed
<EOS>
,
had
he
known
that
if
Mary
had
accompanied
him
,
the
case
might
have
been
rather
different
,
as
her
beauty
would
have
made
her
desirable
as
a
show
-
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
tried
second
-
rate
places
;
at
all
the
payment
of
a
sum
of
money
was
necessary
,
and
money
he
had
none
.
<EOS>
Disheartened
and
angry
,
he
went
home
at
night
,
declaring
it
was
time
lost
;
that
dressmaking
was
at
all
events
a
troublesome
business
,
and
not
worth
learning
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
saw
that
the
grapes
were
sour
,
and
the
next
day
she
set
out
herself
,
as
her
father
could
not
afford
to
lose
another
day
's
work
;
and
before
night
(
as
yesterday
's
experience
had
considerably
lowered
her
ideas
)
<EOS>
she
had
engaged
herself
as
apprentice
(
so
called
,
though
there
were
no
deeds
or
indentures
to
the
bond
)
to
a
certain
Miss
Simmonds
,
milliner
and
dressmaker
,
in
a
respectable
little
street
leading
off
Ardwick
Green
,
where
her
business
was
duly
announced
in
gold
letters
on
a
black
ground
,
enclosed
in
a
bird's
-
eye
maple
frame
,
and
stuck
in
the
front
-
parlour
window
;
where
the
workwomen
were
called
"
her
young
ladies
"
;
and
where
Mary
was
to
work
for
two
years
without
any
remuneration
,
on
consideration
of
being
taught
the
business
;
and
where
afterwards
she
was
to
dine
and
have
tea
,
with
a
small
quarterly
salary
(
paid
quarterly
because
so
much
more
genteel
than
by
the
week
)
,
a
VERY
small
one
,
divisible
into
a
minute
weekly
pittance
.
 
<EOS>
In
summer
she
was
to
be
there
by
six
,
bringing
her
day
's
meals
during
the
first
two
years
;
in
winter
she
was
not
to
come
till
after
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
Her
time
for
returning
home
at
night
must
always
depend
upon
the
quantity
of
work
<EOS>
Miss
Simmonds
had
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
And
Mary
was
satisfied
;
and
seeing
this
,
her
father
was
contented
too
,
although
his
words
were
grumbling
and
morose
;
but
Mary
knew
his
ways
,
and
coaxed
and
planned
for
the
future
so
cheerily
,
that
both
went
to
bed
with
easy
if
not
happy
hearts
.

Another
year
passed
on
.
 
<EOS>
The
waves
of
time
seemed
long
since
to
have
swept
away
all
trace
of
poor
Mary
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
But
her
husband
still
thought
of
her
,
although
with
a
calm
and
quiet
grief
,
in
the
silent
watches
of
the
night
:
and
Mary
would
start
from
her
hard
-
earned
sleep
,
and
think
,
in
her
half
-
dreamy
,
half
-
awakened
state
,
she
saw
her
mother
stand
by
her
bedside
,
as
she
used
to
do
"
in
the
days
of
long
ago
"
;
with
a
shaded
candle
and
an
expression
of
ineffable
tenderness
,
while
she
looked
on
her
sleeping
child
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mary
rubbed
her
eyes
and
sank
back
on
her
pillow
,
awake
,
and
knowing
it
was
a
dream
;
and
still
,
in
all
her
troubles
and
perplexities
,
her
heart
called
on
her
mother
for
aid
,
and
she
thought
,
"
If
mother
had
but
lived
,
she
would
have
helped
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Forgetting
that
the
woman
's
sorrows
are
far
more
difficult
to
mitigate
than
a
child
's
,
even
by
the
mighty
power
of
a
mother
's
love
;
and
unconscious
of
the
fact
,
that
she
was
far
superior
in
sense
and
spirit
to
the
mother
she
mourned
.
 
<EOS>
Aunt
Esther
was
still
mysteriously
absent
,
and
people
had
grown
weary
of
wondering
,
and
begun
to
forget
.
 
<EOS>
Barton
still
attended
his
club
,
and
was
an
active
member
of
a
Trades
'
Union
;
indeed
,
more
frequently
than
ever
,
since
the
time
of
Mary
's
return
in
the
evening
was
so
uncertain
;
and
as
she
occasionally
,
in
very
busy
times
,
remained
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
His
chiefest
friend
was
still
George
Wilson
,
although
he
had
no
great
sympathy
on
the
questions
that
agitated
Barton
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
But
their
hearts
were
bound
by
old
ties
to
one
another
,
and
the
remembrance
of
former
things
gave
an
unspoken
charm
to
their
meetings
.
 
<EOS>
Our
old
friend
,
the
cub
-
like
lad
,
Jem
Wilson
,
had
shot
up
into
the
powerful
,
well
-
made
young
man
,
with
a
sensible
face
enough
;
nay
,
a
face
that
might
have
been
handsome
,
had
it
not
been
here
and
there
marked
by
the
small
-
pox
.
 
<EOS>
He
worked
with
one
of
the
great
firms
of
engineers
,
who
send
from
out
their
towns
of
workshops
engines
and
machinery
to
the
dominions
of
the
Czar
and
the
Sultan
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
and
mother
were
never
weary
of
praising
Jem
,
at
all
which
commendation
<EOS>
pretty
Mary
Barton
would
toss
her
head
,
seeing
clearly
enough
that
they
wished
her
to
understand
what
a
good
husband
he
would
make
,
and
to
favour
his
love
,
about
which
he
never
dared
to
speak
,
whatever
eyes
and
looks
revealed
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
,
in
the
early
winter
time
,
when
people
were
provided
with
warm
substantial
gowns
,
not
likely
soon
to
wear
out
,
and
when
,
accordingly
,
business
was
rather
slack
at
Miss
Simmonds
'
,
Mary
met
Alice
Wilson
,
coming
home
from
her
half
-
day
's
work
at
some
tradesman
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
and
Alice
had
always
liked
each
other
;
indeed
,
Alice
looked
with
particular
interest
on
the
motherless
girl
,
the
daughter
of
her
whose
forgiving
kiss
had
comforted
her
in
many
sleepless
hours
.
 
<EOS>
So
there
was
a
warm
greeting
between
the
tidy
old
woman
and
the
blooming
young
work
-
girl
;
and
then
Alice
ventured
to
ask
if
she
would
come
in
and
take
her
tea
with
her
that
very
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
think
it
dull
enough
to
come
just
to
sit
with
an
old
woman
like
me
,
but
there
's
a
tidy
young
lass
as
lives
in
the
floor
above
,
who
does
plain
work
,
and
now
and
then
a
bit
in
your
own
line
,
Mary
;
she
's
grand
-
daughter
to
old
Job
Legh
,
a
spinner
,
and
a
good
girl
she
is
.
 
<EOS>
Do
come
,
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
I
've
a
terrible
wish
to
make
you
known
to
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
a
genteel
-
looking
lass
,
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
the
beginning
of
this
speech
Mary
had
feared
the
intended
visitor
was
to
be
no
other
than
Alice
's
nephew
;
but
Alice
was
too
delicate
-
minded
to
plan
a
meeting
,
even
for
her
dear
Jem
,
when
one
would
have
been
an
unwilling
party
;
and
Mary
,
relieved
from
her
apprehension
by
the
conclusion
,
gladly
agreed
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
How
busy
Alice
felt
!
<EOS>
it
was
not
often
she
had
any
one
to
tea
;
and
now
her
sense
of
the
duties
of
a
hostess
were
almost
too
much
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
made
haste
home
,
and
lighted
the
unwilling
fire
,
borrowing
a
pair
of
bellows
to
make
it
burn
the
faster
.
 
<EOS>
For
herself
she
was
always
patient
;
she
let
the
coals
take
their
time
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
put
on
her
pattens
,
and
went
to
fill
her
kettle
at
the
pump
in
the
next
court
,
and
on
her
way
she
borrowed
a
cup
;
of
odd
saucers
she
had
plenty
,
serving
as
plates
when
occasion
required
.
 
<EOS>
Half
an
ounce
of
tea
and
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
butter
went
far
to
absorb
her
morning
's
wages
;
but
this
was
an
unusual
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
In
general
,
she
used
herb
-
tea
for
herself
,
when
at
home
,
unless
some
thoughtful
mistress
made
a
present
of
tea
-
leaves
from
her
more
abundant
household
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
chairs
drawn
out
for
visitors
,
and
duly
swept
and
dusted
;
an
old
board
arranged
with
some
skill
upon
two
old
candle
boxes
set
on
end
(
rather
rickety
to
be
sure
,
but
she
knew
the
seat
of
old
,
and
when
to
sit
lightly
;
indeed
the
whole
affair
was
more
for
apparent
dignity
of
position
than
for
any
real
ease
)
;
a
little
,
very
little
round
table
,
put
just
before
the
fire
,
which
by
this
time
was
blazing
merrily
;
her
unlacquered
ancient
,
third
-
hand
tea
-
tray
arranged
with
a
black
tea
-
pot
,
two
cups
with
a
red
and
white
pattern
,
and
one
with
the
old
friendly
willow
pattern
,
and
saucers
,
not
to
match
(
on
one
of
the
extra
supply
the
lump
of
butter
flourished
away
)
;
all
these
preparations
complete
,
Alice
began
to
look
about
her
with
satisfaction
,
and
a
sort
of
wonder
what
more
could
be
done
to
add
to
the
comfort
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
one
of
the
chairs
away
from
its
appropriate
place
by
the
table
,
and
putting
it
close
to
the
broad
large
hanging
shelf
I
told
you
about
when
I
first
described
her
cellar
-
dwelling
,
and
mounting
on
it
,
she
pulled
towards
her
an
old
deal
box
,
and
took
thence
a
quantity
of
the
oat
bread
of
the
north
,
the
"
clap
-
bread
"
of
Cumberland
and
Westmoreland
,
and
descending
carefully
with
the
thin
cakes
,
threatening
to
break
to
pieces
in
her
hand
,
she
placed
them
on
the
bare
table
,
with
the
belief
that
her
visitors
would
have
an
unusual
treat
in
eating
the
bread
of
her
childhood
.
 
<EOS>
She
brought
out
a
good
piece
of
a
four
-
pound
loaf
of
common
household
bread
as
well
,
and
then
sat
down
to
rest
,
really
to
rest
,
and
not
to
pretend
,
on
one
of
the
rush
-
bottomed
chairs
.
 
<EOS>
The
candle
was
ready
to
be
lighted
,
the
kettle
boiled
,
the
tea
was
awaiting
its
doom
in
its
paper
parcel
;
all
was
ready
.
  
<EOS>
A
knock
at
the
door
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
Margaret
,
the
young
workwoman
who
lived
in
the
rooms
above
,
who
having
heard
the
bustle
,
and
the
subsequent
quiet
,
began
to
think
it
was
time
to
pay
her
visit
below
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
sallow
,
unhealthy
,
sweet
-
looking
young
woman
,
with
a
careworn
look
;
her
dress
was
humble
and
very
simple
,
consisting
of
some
kind
of
dark
stuff
gown
,
her
neck
being
covered
by
a
drab
shawl
or
large
handkerchief
,
pinned
down
behind
and
at
the
sides
in
front
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
gave
her
a
hearty
greeting
,
and
made
her
sit
down
on
the
chair
she
had
just
left
,
while
she
balanced
herself
on
the
board
seat
,
in
order
that
Margaret
might
think
it
was
quite
her
free
and
independent
choice
to
sit
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
think
what
keeps
Mary
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
quite
grand
with
her
late
hours
,
"
said
Alice
,
as
Mary
still
delayed
.
  
<EOS>
The
truth
was
,
Mary
was
dressing
herself
;
yes
,
to
come
to
poor
old
Alice
's
 
<EOS>
she
thought
it
worth
while
to
consider
what
gown
she
should
put
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
for
Alice
,
however
,
you
may
be
pretty
sure
;
no
,
they
knew
each
other
too
well
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mary
liked
making
an
impression
,
and
in
this
it
must
be
owned
she
was
pretty
often
gratified
 
and
there
was
this
strange
girl
to
consider
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
put
on
her
pretty
new
blue
merino
,
made
tight
to
her
throat
her
little
linen
collar
and
linen
cuffs
,
and
sallied
forth
to
impress
poor
gentle
Margaret
.
 
<EOS>
She
certainly
succeeded
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
,
who
never
thought
much
about
beauty
,
had
never
told
Margaret
how
pretty
Mary
was
;
and
,
as
she
came
in
half
-
blushing
at
her
own
self
-
consciousness
,
Margaret
could
hardly
take
her
eyes
off
her
,
and
Mary
put
down
her
long
black
lashes
with
a
sort
of
dislike
of
the
very
observation
she
had
taken
such
pains
to
secure
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
fancy
the
bustle
of
Alice
to
make
the
tea
,
to
pour
it
out
,
and
sweeten
it
to
their
liking
,
to
help
and
help
again
to
clap
-
bread
and
bread
and
butter
?
 
<EOS>
Can
you
fancy
the
delight
with
which
she
watched
her
piled
-
up
clap
-
bread
disappear
before
the
hungry
girls
and
listened
to
the
praises
of
her
home
-
remembered
dainty
?
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
used
to
send
me
some
clap
-
bread
by
any
north
-
country
person
 
bless
her
!
<EOS>
She
knew
how
good
such
things
taste
when
far
away
from
home
.
 
<EOS>
Not
but
what
every
one
likes
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
was
in
service
my
fellow
-
servants
were
always
glad
to
share
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
,
it
's
a
long
time
ago
,
yon
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
tell
us
about
it
,
Alice
,
"
said
Margaret
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
lass
,
there
's
nothing
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
more
mouths
at
home
than
could
be
fed
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
,
that
's
Will
's
father
<EOS>
(
you
do
n't
know
Will
,
but
he
's
a
sailor
to
foreign
parts
)
,
had
come
to
Manchester
,
and
sent
word
what
terrible
lots
of
work
was
to
be
had
,
both
for
lads
and
lasses
.
 
<EOS>
So
father
sent
George
first
(
you
know
George
,
well
enough
,
Mary
)
,
and
then
work
was
scarce
out
toward
Burton
,
where
we
lived
,
and
father
said
I
maun
try
and
get
a
place
.
 
<EOS>
And
George
wrote
as
how
wages
were
far
higher
in
Manchester
than
Milnthorpe
or
Lancaster
;
<EOS>
and
,
lasses
,
I
was
young
and
thoughtless
,
and
thought
it
was
a
fine
thing
to
go
so
far
from
home
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
one
day
,
th
'
butcher
he
brings
us
a
letter
fra
George
,
to
say
he
'd
heard
on
a
place
 
<EOS>
and
I
was
all
agog
to
go
,
and
father
was
pleased
like
<EOS>
;
but
mother
said
little
,
and
that
little
was
very
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
often
thought
she
was
a
bit
hurt
to
see
me
so
ready
to
go
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
me
!
 
<EOS>
But
she
packed
up
my
clothes
,
and
some
of
the
better
end
of
her
own
as
would
fit
me
,
in
yon
little
paper
box
up
there
 
<EOS>
it
's
good
for
nought
now
,
but
I
would
liefer
live
without
fire
than
break
it
up
to
be
burnt
;
and
yet
it
is
going
on
for
eighty
years
old
,
<EOS>
for
she
had
it
when
she
was
a
girl
,
and
brought
all
her
clothes
in
it
to
father
's
when
they
were
married
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
was
saying
,
she
did
not
cry
,
though
the
tears
was
often
in
her
eyes
;
and
I
seen
her
looking
after
me
down
the
lane
as
long
as
I
were
in
sight
,
with
her
hand
shading
her
eyes
 
<EOS>
and
that
were
the
last
look
I
ever
had
on
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
knew
that
before
long
she
should
go
to
that
mother
;
and
,
besides
,
the
griefs
and
bitter
woes
of
youth
have
worn
themselves
out
before
we
grow
old
;
but
she
looked
so
sorrowful
that
the
girls
caught
her
sadness
,
and
mourned
for
the
poor
woman
who
had
been
dead
and
gone
so
many
years
ago
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
never
see
her
again
,
Alice
?
 
<EOS>
Did
you
never
go
home
while
she
was
alive
?
"
asked
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
nor
since
.
 
<EOS>
Many
a
time
and
oft
<EOS>
have
I
planned
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
plan
it
yet
,
and
hope
to
go
home
again
before
it
please
God
to
take
me
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
try
and
save
money
enough
to
go
for
a
week
when
I
was
in
service
;
but
first
one
thing
came
,
and
then
another
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
missis
's
children
fell
ill
of
the
measles
,
just
when
the
week
I
'd
asked
for
came
,
and
I
could
n't
leave
them
,
for
one
and
all
cried
for
me
to
nurse
them
.
 
<EOS>
Then
missis
herself
fell
sick
,
and
I
could
go
less
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
you
see
,
they
kept
a
little
shop
,
and
he
drank
,
and
missis
and
me
was
all
there
was
to
mind
children
and
shop
and
all
,
and
cook
and
wash
besides
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
was
glad
she
had
not
gone
into
service
,
and
said
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
lass
!
<EOS>
thou
little
knows
the
pleasure
o
'
helping
others
;
I
was
as
happy
there
as
could
be
;
almost
as
happy
as
I
was
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
next
year
I
thought
I
could
go
at
a
leisure
time
,
and
missis
telled
me
<EOS>
I
should
have
a
fortnight
then
,
and
I
used
to
sit
up
all
that
winter
working
hard
at
patchwork
,
to
have
a
quilt
of
my
own
making
to
take
to
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
But
master
died
,
and
missis
went
away
fra
Manchester
,
and
I
'd
to
look
out
for
a
place
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
"
interrupted
Mary
,
"
I
should
have
thought
that
was
the
best
time
to
go
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
thought
not
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
it
was
a
different
thing
going
home
for
a
week
on
a
visit
,
may
be
with
money
in
my
pocket
to
give
father
a
lift
,
to
going
home
to
be
a
burden
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
how
could
I
hear
o
'
a
place
there
?
 
<EOS>
Anyways
I
thought
it
best
to
stay
,
though
perhaps
it
might
have
been
better
to
ha
'
gone
,
for
then
I
should
ha
'
seen
mother
again
"
;
and
the
poor
old
woman
looked
puzzled
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
you
did
what
you
thought
right
,
"
said
Margaret
gently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
lass
<EOS>
,
that
's
it
,
"
said
Alice
,
raising
her
head
and
speaking
more
cheerfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
thing
,
and
then
let
the
Lord
send
what
He
sees
fit
;
not
but
that
I
grieved
sore
,
oh
,
sore
and
sad
,
when
towards
spring
next
year
,
when
my
quilt
were
all
done
to
th
'
lining
,
George
came
in
one
evening
to
tell
me
mother
was
dead
.
 
<EOS>
I
cried
many
a
night
at
after
;
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
I
'd
no
time
for
crying
by
day
,
for
that
missis
was
terrible
strict
;
she
would
not
hearken
to
my
going
to
th
'
funeral
;
and
indeed
I
would
have
been
too
late
,
for
George
set
off
that
very
night
by
th
'
coach
,
and
the
letter
had
been
kept
or
summut
<EOS>
(
posts
were
not
like
th
'
posts
now
-
a
-
days
)
,
and
he
found
the
burial
all
over
,
and
father
talking
o
'
flitting
;
for
he
could
n't
abide
the
cottage
after
mother
was
gone
.
"
     
<EOS>
"
Was
it
a
pretty
place
?
"
asked
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
,
lass
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
seed
such
a
bonny
bit
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
there
are
hills
there
as
seem
to
go
up
into
th
'
skies
,
not
near
maybe
,
but
that
makes
them
all
the
bonnier
.
 
<EOS>
I
used
to
think
they
were
the
golden
hills
of
heaven
,
about
which
mother
sang
when
I
was
a
child
   
<EOS>

Something
about
a
ship
and
a
lover
that
should
hae
been
na
lover
,
the
ballad
was
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
and
near
our
cottage
were
rocks

Eh

lasses
!

ye
do

some

some

the

knee

deep
in

smelling
sae
sweet

the

Mother
used
to
send
Sally
and
me
out
to
gather
ling
and
heather
for
besoms
,
and
it
was
such
pleasant
work
!
 
<EOS>
We
used
to
come
home
of
an
evening
loaded
so
as
you
could
not
see
us
,
for
all
that
it
was
so
light
to
carry
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
mother
would
make
us
sit
down
under
the
old
hawthorn
tree
(
where
we
used
to
make
our
house
among
the
great
roots
as
stood
above
th

)
,
to
pick
and
tie
up
the
heather
.

It
seems
all

it

Poor

Sally
has
been
in

grave
this

But
I
often
wonder
if
the
hawthorn
is
standing
yet
,

if
the
lasses
still
go
to
gather
heather
,

we
did
many

a

Why

asked

<EOS>
"
Why
,
lass
!
<EOS>
first
one
wanted
me
and
then
another
;
and
I
could
n't
go
without
money
either
,
and
I
got
very
poor
at
times
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
was
a
scapegrace
,
poor
fellow
,
and
always
wanted
help
of
one
kind
or
another
;
and
his
wife
(
for
I
think
scapegraces
are
always
married
long
before
steady
folk
)
was
but
a
helpless
kind
of
body
.
 
<EOS>
She
were
always
ailing
,
and
he
were
always
in
trouble
;
so
I
had
enough
to
do
with
my
hands
,
and
my
money
too
,
for
that
matter
.
 
<EOS>
They
died
within
twelvemonth
of
each
other
,
leaving
one
lad
(
they
had
had
seven
,
but
the
Lord
had
taken
six
to
Hisself
)
,
<EOS>
Will
,
as
I
was
telling
you
on
;
and
I
took
him
myself
,
and
left
service
to
make
a
bit
of
a
home
-
place
for
him
,
and
a
fine
lad
he
was
,
the
very
spit
of
his
father
as
to
looks
,
only
steadier
.
 
<EOS>
For
he
was
steady
,
although
nought
would
serve
him
but
going
to
sea
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
all
I
could
to
set
him
again
a
sailor
's
life
.
 
<EOS>
Says
I
,
"
Folks
is
as
sick
as

all
the

<EOS>
Your
own
mother
telled
me
(
for
she
came
from
foreign
parts
,
being
a
Manx
woman
)
<EOS>
that
she
'd
ha
'
thanked
any
one
for
throwing
her
into

"
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
sent
him
a
'
the
way
to
Runcorn
by
th
'
Duke
's
canal
,
that
he
might
know
what
th

were
;
and
I
looked
to
see
him
come
back
as
white
as
a
sheet
wi
'
vomiting
.
<EOS>
But
the
lad
went
on
to
Liverpool
and
saw
real
ships
,
and
came
back
more
set
than
ever
on
being
a
sailor
,
and
he
said
as
how
he
had
never
been
sick
at
all
,
and
thought
he
could
stand
the
sea
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
told
him
he
mun
do
as
he
liked
;
and
he
thanked
me
and
kissed
me
,
for
all
I
was
very
frabbit
<EOS>

<EOS>
with
him
;
and
now
he

<EOS>
Mary
stole
a
glance
at
Margaret
to
see
what
she
thought
of
Alice
's
geography
;
but
Margaret
looked
so
quiet
and
demure
,
that
Mary
was
in
doubt
if
she
were
not
really
ignorant
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
Mary
's
knowledge
was
very
profound
,
but
she
had
seen
a
terrestrial
globe
,
and
knew
where
to
find
France
and
the
continents
on
a
map
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
long
talking
Alice
seemed
lost
for
a
time
in
reverie
;
and
the
girls
respecting
her
thoughts
,
which
they
suspected
had
wandered
to
the
home
and
scenes
of
her
childhood
,
were
silent
.
 
<EOS>
All
at
once
she
recalled
her
duties
as
hostess
,
and
by
an
effort
brought
back
her
mind
to
the
present
time

<EOS>
"
Margaret
,

<EOS>
I

With

The
air
to
which
this
is
sung
is
a
kind
of
droning
recitative
,
depending
much
on
expression
and
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
To
read
it
,
it
may
,
perhaps
,
seem
humorous
;
but
it
is
that
humour
which
is
near
akin
to
pathos
,

to
those
who
have
seen
the
distress
it
describes
it
is
a
powerfully
pathetic
song

Margaret
had
both
witnessed
the
destitution
,
and
had
the
heart
to
feel
it
,
and
withal
,
her
voice
was
of
that
rich
and
rare
order
,
which
does
not
require
any
great
compass
of
notes
to
make
itself
appreciated
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
had
her
quiet
enjoyment
of
tears
.
 
<EOS>
But
Margaret
,
with
fixed
eye
,
and
earnest
,
dreamy
look
,
seemed
to
become
more
and
more
absorbed
in
realising
to
herself
the
woe
she
had
been
describing
,
and
<EOS>
which
she
felt
might
at
that
very
moment
be
suffering
and
hopeless
within
a
short
distance
of
their
comparative
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
she
burst
forth
with
all
the
power
of
her
magnificent
voice
,
as
if
a
prayer
from
her
very
heart
for
all
who
were
in
distress
,
in
the
grand
supplication
,
"
Lord

Mary
held
her
breath
,
unwilling
to
lose
a
note
,
it
was
so
clear
,
so
perfect
,
so
imploring
.
 
<EOS>
A
far
more
correct
musician
than
Mary
might
have
paused
with
equal
admiration
of
the
really
scientific
knowledge
with
which
the
poor
depressed
-
looking
young
needlewoman
used
her
superb
and
flexile
voice

(
once

<EOS>
might
have

<EOS>
She
stopped
;
and
with
tears
of
holy
sympathy
in
her
eyes
,
Alice
thanked
the
songstress
,
who
resumed
her
calm
,
demure
manner
,
much
to
Mary
's
wonder
,
for
she
looked
at
her
unweariedly
,
as
if
surprised
that
the
hidden
power
should
not
be
perceived
in
the
outward
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
When
Alice
's
little
speech
of
thanks
was
over
,
there
was
quiet
enough
to
hear
a
fine
,
though
rather
quavering
,
male
voice
,
going
over
again
one
or
two
strains
of
Margaret
's
song
.
  
<EOS>
"

There

a

unknown

many
of

whose
existence
will

kindred

In

common

Newton

open

It

perhaps
less

have
their
warm

There
are
botanists
among

equally
familiar

Natural

who
know
the
name

habitat

within
a

their
dwellings

who
steal
the
holiday

two

any
particular
plant
should
be
in
flower
,
and
tying
up
their
simple

handkerchiefs

set
off

,
who
pore
over
every
new
specimen
with
real
scientific
delight
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
is
it
the
common
and
more
obvious
divisions
of
Entomology
and
Botany
that
alone
attract
these
earnest
seekers
after
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
may
be
owing
to
the
great
annual
town
-
holiday
of
Whitsun
-
week
so
often
falling
in
May
or
June
,
that
the
two
great
beautiful
families
of
Ephemeridae
and
Phryganidae
have
been
so
much
and
so
closely
studied
by
Manchester
workmen
,
while
they
have
in
a
great
measure
escaped
general
observation
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
will
refer
to
the
preface
to
Sir
J.
E.
Smith
's
Life
(
I
have
it
not
by
me
,
or
I
would
copy
you
the
exact
passage
)
,
you
will
find
that
he
names
a
little
circumstance
corroborative
of
what
I
have
said
.
 
<EOS>
Being
on
a
visit
to
Roscoe
,
of
Liverpool
,
he
made
some
inquiries
of
him
as
to
the
habitat
of
a
very
rare
plant
,
said
to
be
found
in
certain
places
in
Lancashire
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Roscoe
knew
nothing
of
the
plant
;
but
stated
,
that
if
any
one
could
give
him
the
desired
information
,
it
would
be
a
hand
-
loom
weaver
in
Manchester
,
whom
he
named
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
J.
E.
Smith
proceeded
by
boat
to
Manchester
,
and
on
arriving
at
that
town
,
he
inquired
of
the
porter
who
was
carrying
his
luggage
if
he
could
direct
him
to
So
-
and
-
So
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
replied
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
does
a
bit
in
my
way
"
;
and
,
on
further
investigation
,
it
turned
out
that
both
the
porter
and
his
friend
the
weaver
were
skilful
botanists
,
and
able
to
give
Sir
J.
E.
Smith
the
very
information
which
he
wanted
.
  
<EOS>
Such
are
the
tastes
and
pursuits
of
some
of
the
thoughtful
,
little
understood
,
working
-
men
of
Manchester
.
  
<EOS>
And
Margaret
's
grandfather
was
one
of
these
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
little
wiry
-
looking
old
man
,
who
moved
with
a
jerking
motion
,
as
if
his
limbs
were
worked
by
a
string
like
a
child
's
toy
,
with
dun
-
coloured
hair
lying
thin
and
soft
at
the
back
and
sides
of
his
head
;
his
forehead
was
so
large
it
seemed
to
overbalance
the
rest
of
his
face
,
<EOS>
which
had
,
indeed
,
lost
its
natural
contour
by
the
absence
of
all
the
teeth
.
 
<EOS>
The
eyes
absolutely
gleamed
with
intelligence
;
so
keen
,
so
observant
,
you
felt
as
if
they
were
almost
wizard
-
like
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
whole
room
looked
not
unlike
a
wizard
's
dwelling
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
pictures
were
hung
rude
wooden
frames
of
impaled
insects
;
the
little
table
was
covered
with
cabalistic
books
;
and
beside
them
lay
a
case
of
mysterious
instruments
,
one
of
which
Job
Legh
was
using
when
his
grand
-
daughter
entered
.
  
<EOS>
On
her
appearance
he
pushed
his
spectacles
up
so
as
to
rest
midway
on
his
forehead
,
and
gave
Mary
a
short
,
kind
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
But
Margaret
he
caressed
as
a
mother
<EOS>
caresses
her
first
-
born
;
stroking
her
with
tenderness
,
and
almost
altering
his
voice
as
he
spoke
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
looked
round
on
the
odd
,
strange
things
she
had
never
seen
at
home
,
and
which
seemed
to
her
to
have
a
very
uncanny
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
your
grandfather
a
fortune
-
teller
?
"
<EOS>
whispered
she
to
her
new
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Margaret
,
in
the
same
voice
;
"
but
you
are
not
the
first
as
has
taken
him
for
such
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
only
fond
of
such
things
as
most
folks
know
nothing
about
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
know
aught
about
them
too
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
a
bit
about
some
of
the
things
grandfather
is
fond
on
;
just
because
he
's
fond
on
'em
,
I
tried
to
learn
about
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
things
are
these
?
"
said
Mary
,
struck
with
the
weird
-
looking
creatures
that
sprawled
around
the
room
in
their
roughly
-
made
glass
cases
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
was
not
prepared
for
the
technical
names
,
which
Job
Legh
pattered
down
on
her
ear
,
on
which
they
fell
like
hail
on
a
skylight
;
and
<EOS>
the
strange
language
only
bewildered
her
more
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
saw
the
state
of
the
case
,
and
came
to
the
rescue
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
,
Mary
,
at
this
horrid
scorpion
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
me
such
a
fright
<EOS>
:
I
am
all
of
a
twitter
yet
when
I
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Grandfather
went
to
Liverpool
one
Whitsun
-
week
to
go
strolling
about
the
docks
and
pick
up
what
he
could
from
the
sailors
,
who
often
bring
some
queer
thing
or
another
from
the
hot
countries
they
go
to
;
and
so
he
sees
a
chap
with
a
bottle
in
his
hand
,
like
a
druggist
's
physic
-
bottle
;
and
says
grandfather
,
"
What
have
ye
gotten
there
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
the
sailor
holds
it
up
,
and
grandfather
knew
it
was
a
rare
kind
<EOS>
o
'
scorpion
,
not
common
even
in
the
East
Indies
where
the
man
came
from
;
and
says
he
,
"
How
did
you
catch
this
fine
fellow
,
for
he
would
n't
be
taken
for
nothing
,
I
'm
thinking
?
"
 
<EOS>
And
the
man
said
as
how
when
they
were
unloading
the
ship
he
'd
found
him
lying
behind
a
bag
of
rice
,
and
he
thought
the
cold
had
killed
him
,
for
he
was
not
squashed
nor
injured
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
like
to
part
with
any
of
the
spirit
out
of
his
grog
to
put
the
scorpion
in
,
but
slipped
him
into
the
bottle
,
knowing
there
were
folks
enow
who
would
give
him
something
for
him
.
<EOS>
So
grandfather
gives
him
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Two
shillings
,
"
interrupted
Job
Legh
;
"
and
a
good
bargain
it
was
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
grandfather
came
home
as
proud
as
Punch
,
and
pulled
the
bottle
out
of
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
see
th
'
scorpion
were
doubled
up
,
and
grandfather
thought
I
could
n't
fairly
see
how
big
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
shakes
him
out
right
before
the
fire
;
and
a
good
warm
one
it
was
,
for
I
was
ironing
<EOS>
,
I
remember
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
off
ironing
and
stooped
down
over
him
,
to
look
at
him
better
,
and
grandfather
got
a
book
,
and
began
to
read
how
this
very
kind
were
the
most
poisonous
and
vicious
species
,
how
their
bite
were
often
fatal
,
and
then
went
on
to
read
how
people
who
were
bitten
got
swelled
,
and
screamed
with
pain
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
listening
hard
,
but
as
it
fell
out
,
I
never
took
my
eyes
off
the
creature
,
though
I
could
not
ha
'
told
I
was
watching
it
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
it
seemed
to
give
a
jerk
,
and
before
I
could
speak
it
gave
another
,
and
in
a
minute
it
was
as
wild
as
it
could
be
,
running
at
me
just
like
a
mad
dog
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
do
?
"
asked
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Me
!
<EOS>
why
,
I
jumped
first
on
a
chair
,
and
then
on
all
the
things
I
'd
been
ironing
on
the
dresser
,
and
I
screamed
for
grandfather
to
come
up
by
me
,
but
he
did
not
hearken
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
if
I
'd
come
up
by
thee
,
who
'd
ha
'
caught
the
creature
,
I
should
like
to
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
begged
grandfather
to
crush
it
,
and
I
had
the
iron
right
over
it
once
,
ready
to
drop
,
but
grandfather
begged
me
not
to
hurt
it
in
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
could
n't
think
what
he
'd
have
<EOS>
,
for
he
hopped
round
the
room
as
if
he
were
sore
afraid
,
for
all
he
begged
me
not
to
injure
it
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
goes
to
th
'
kettle
,
and
lifts
up
the
lid
,
and
peeps
in
.
 
<EOS>
What
on
earth
is
he
doing
that
for
,
thinks
I
;
he
'll
never
drink
his
tea
with
a
scorpion
running
free
and
easy
about
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
takes
the
tongs
,
and
he
settles
his
spectacles
on
his
nose
,
and
in
a
minute
he
had
lifted
the
creature
up
by
th
'
leg
,
and
dropped
him
into
the
boiling
water
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
that
kill
him
?
"
said
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
sure
enough
;
he
boiled
for
longer
time
than
grandfather
liked
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
so
afeard
of
his
coming
round
again
<EOS>
,
I
ran
to
the
public
-
house
for
some
gin
,
and
grandfather
filled
the
bottle
,
and
then
we
poured
off
the
water
,
and
picked
him
out
of
the
kettle
,
and
dropped
him
into
the
bottle
,
and
he
were
there
about
a
twelvemonth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
brought
him
to
life
at
first
?
"
asked
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
see
,
he
were
never
really
dead
,
only
torpid
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
dead
asleep
with
the
cold
,
and
<EOS>
our
good
fire
brought
him
round
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
father
does
not
care
for
such
things
,
"
said
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'm
often
<EOS>
downright
glad
grandfather
is
so
fond
of
his
books
,
and
his
creatures
,
and
his
plants
.
 
<EOS>
It
does
my
heart
good
to
see
him
so
happy
,
sorting
them
all
at
home
,
and
so
ready
to
go
in
search
of
more
,
whenever
he
's
a
spare
day
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
him
now
!
<EOS>
he
's
gone
back
to
his
books
,
and
he
'll
be
as
happy
as
a
king
,
working
away
<EOS>
till
I
make
him
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
It
keeps
him
silent
,
to
be
sure
;
but
so
long
as
I
see
him
earnest
,
and
pleased
,
and
eager
,
what
does
that
matter
?
 
<EOS>
Then
,
when
he
has
his
talking
bouts
,
you
ca
n't
think
how
much
he
has
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
grandfather
!
<EOS>
you
do
n't
know
how
happy
we
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
wondered
if
the
dear
grandfather
heard
all
this
,
for
Margaret
did
not
speak
in
an
undertone
;
but
no
!
<EOS>
he
was
far
too
deep
,
and
eager
in
solving
a
problem
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
even
notice
Mary
's
leave
-
taking
,
and
she
went
home
with
the
feeling
that
she
had
that
night
made
the
acquaintance
of
two
of
the
strangest
people
she
ever
saw
in
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
,
so
quiet
,
so
commonplace
,
until
her
singing
powers
were
called
forth
;
so
silent
from
home
,
so
cheerful
and
agreeable
at
home
;
and
her
grandfather
so
very
different
to
any
one
Mary
had
ever
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
had
said
he
was
not
a
fortune
-
teller
,
but
she
did
not
know
whether
to
believe
her
.
  
<EOS>
To
resolve
her
doubts
,
she
told
the
history
of
the
evening
to
her
father
,
who
was
interested
by
her
account
,
and
curious
to
see
and
judge
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Opportunities
are
not
often
wanting
where
inclination
goes
before
,
and
ere
the
end
of
that
winter
Mary
looked
upon
Margaret
almost
as
an
old
friend
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
would
bring
her
work
when
Mary
was
likely
to
be
at
home
in
the
evenings
and
sit
with
her
;
and
Job
Legh
would
put
a
book
and
his
pipe
in
his
pocket
and
just
step
round
the
corner
to
fetch
his
grandchild
,
ready
for
a
talk
if
he
found
Barton
in
;
ready
to
pull
out
pipe
and
book
if
the
girls
wanted
him
to
wait
,
and
John
was
still
at
his
club
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
ready
to
do
whatever
would
give
pleasure
to
his
darling
Margaret
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
points
of
resemblance
,
or
dissimilitude
(
for
this
joins
people
as
often
as
that
)
attracted
the
two
girls
to
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
had
the
great
charm
of
possessing
good
strong
common
sense
,
and
do
you
not
perceive
how
involuntarily
this
is
valued
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
so
pleasant
to
have
a
friend
who
possesses
the
power
of
setting
a
difficult
question
in
a
clear
light
;
whose
judgment
can
tell
what
is
best
to
be
done
;
and
who
is
so
convinced
of
what
is
"
wisest
,
best
,
"
that
in
consideration
of
the
end
,
all
difficulties
in
the
way
diminish
.
 
<EOS>
People
admire
talent
,
and
talk
about
their
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
value
common
sense
without
talking
about
it
,
and
often
without
knowing
it
.
  
<EOS>
So
Mary
and
Margaret
grew
in
love
one
toward
the
other
;
and
Mary
told
many
of
her
feelings
in
a
way
she
had
never
done
before
to
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
her
foibles
also
were
made
known
to
Margaret
,
but
not
all
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
one
cherished
weakness
still
concealed
from
every
one
.
 
<EOS>
It
concerned
a
lover
,
not
beloved
,
but
favoured
by
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
A
gallant
,
handsome
young
man
;
but
 
not
beloved
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
Mary
hoped
to
meet
him
every
day
in
her
walks
,
blushed
when
she
heard
his
name
,
and
tried
to
think
of
him
as
her
future
husband
,
and
above
all
,
tried
to
think
of
herself
as
his
future
wife
.
 
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
poor
Mary
!
<EOS>
Bitter
woe
did
thy
weakness
work
thee
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
other
lovers
.
 
<EOS>
One
or
two
would
gladly
have
kept
her
company
,
but
she
held
herself
too
high
,
they
said
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
Wilson
said
nothing
,
but
loved
on
and
on
,
ever
more
fondly
;
he
hoped
against
hope
;
he
would
not
give
up
,
for
it
seemed
like
giving
up
life
to
give
up
thought
of
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
dare
to
look
to
any
end
of
all
this
;
<EOS>
the
present
,
so
that
he
saw
her
,
touched
the
hem
of
her
garment
,
was
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
,
in
time
,
such
deep
hope
would
beget
love
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
not
relinquish
hope
,
and
yet
her
coldness
of
manner
was
enough
to
daunt
any
man
;
and
it
made
Jem
more
despairing
than
he
would
acknowledge
for
a
long
time
even
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
But
one
evening
he
came
round
by
Barton
's
house
,
a
willing
messenger
for
his
father
,
and
opening
the
door
saw
Margaret
sitting
asleep
before
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
come
in
to
speak
to
Mary
;
and
worn
-
out
by
a
long
,
working
,
watching
night
,
she
fell
asleep
in
the
genial
warmth
.
  
<EOS>
An
old
-
fashioned
saying
about
a
pair
of
gloves
came
into
Jem
's
mind
,
and
stepping
gently
up
,
he
kissed
Margaret
with
a
friendly
kiss
.
  
<EOS>
She
awoke
,
and
perfectly
understanding
the
thing
,
she
said
,
"
<EOS>
For
shame
of
yourself
,
Jem
!
 
<EOS>
What
would
Mary
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
Lightly
said
,
lightly
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
'd
nobbut
say
,
practice
makes
perfect
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
they
both
laughed
.
<EOS>
But
the
words
Margaret
had
said
rankled
in
Jem
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Would
Mary
care
?
 
<EOS>
Would
she
care
in
the
very
least
?
 
<EOS>
They
seemed
to
call
for
an
answer
by
night
and
by
day
;
and
Jem
felt
that
his
heart
told
him
Mary
was
quite
indifferent
to
any
action
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
Still
he
loved
on
,
and
on
,
ever
more
fondly
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
's
father
was
well
aware
of
the
nature
of
Jem
Wilson
's
feelings
for
his
daughter
,
but
he
took
no
notice
of
them
to
any
one
,
thinking
Mary
full
young
yet
for
the
cares
of
married
life
,
and
unwilling
,
too
,
to
entertain
the
idea
of
parting
with
her
at
any
time
,
however
distant
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
welcomed
Jem
at
his
house
,
as
he
would
have
done
his
father
's
son
,
whatever
were
his
motives
for
coming
;
and
now
and
then
admitted
the
thought
,
that
Mary
might
do
worse
,
when
her
time
came
,
than
marry
Jem
Wilson
,
a
steady
workman
at
a
good
trade
,
a
good
son
to
his
parents
,
and
a
fine
manly
spirited
chap
 
at
least
when
Mary
was
not
by
;
for
when
she
was
present
he
watched
her
too
closely
,
and
too
anxiously
,
to
have
much
of
what
John
Barton
called
"
spunk
"
in
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
towards
the
end
of
February
,
in
that
year
,
and
a
bitter
black
frost
had
lasted
for
many
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
The
keen
east
wind
had
long
since
swept
the
streets
clean
,
though
in
a
gusty
day
the
dust
would
rise
like
pounded
ice
,
and
make
people
's
faces
quite
smart
with
the
cold
force
with
which
it
blew
against
them
.
 
<EOS>
Houses
,
sky
,
people
,
and
everything
looked
as
if
a
gigantic
brush
had
washed
them
all
over
with
a
dark
shade
of
Indian
ink
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
some
reason
for
this
grimy
appearance
on
human
beings
,
whatever
there
might
be
for
the
dun
looks
of
the
landscape
;
for
soft
water
had
become
an
article
not
even
to
be
purchased
;
and
the
poor
washerwomen
might
be
seen
vainly
trying
to
procure
a
little
by
breaking
the
thick
grey
ice
that
coated
the
ditches
and
ponds
in
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
People
prophesied
a
long
continuance
to
this
already
lengthened
frost
;
said
the
spring
would
be
very
late
;
no
spring
fashions
required
;
no
summer
clothing
chased
for
a
short
uncertain
summer
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
there
was
no
end
to
the
evil
prophesied
during
the
continuance
of
that
bleak
east
wind
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
hurried
home
one
evening
,
just
as
daylight
was
fading
,
from
Miss
Simmonds
'
,
with
her
shawl
held
up
to
her
mouth
,
and
her
head
bent
as
if
in
deprecation
of
the
meeting
wind
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
did
not
perceive
Margaret
till
she
was
close
upon
her
at
the
very
turning
into
the
court
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
me
,
Margaret
!
<EOS>
is
that
you
?
 
<EOS>
Where
are
you
bound
to
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
nowhere
<EOS>
but
your
own
house
(
that
is
,
if
you
'll
take
me
in
)
.
<EOS>
I
've
a
job
of
work
to
finish
to
-
night
;
mourning
,
as
must
be
in
time
for
the
funeral
to
-
morrow
;
and
grandfather
has
been
out
moss
-
hunting
,
and
will
not
be
home
till
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
charming
it
will
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
help
you
if
you
're
backward
.
<EOS>
Have
you
much
to
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
only
got
the
order
yesterday
at
noon
;
and
there
's
three
girls
beside
the
mother
;
and
what
with
trying
on
and
matching
the
stuff
(
for
there
was
not
enough
in
the
piece
they
chose
first
)
,
I
'm
above
a
bit
behindhand
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
the
skirts
all
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
I
kept
that
work
till
candlelight
;
and
the
sleeves
,
to
say
nothing
of
little
bits
to
the
bodies
;
for
the
missis
is
very
particular
,
and
I
could
scarce
keep
from
smiling
while
they
were
crying
so
,
really
taking
on
sadly
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
,
to
hear
first
one
and
then
t'other
clear
up
to
notice
the
set
of
her
gown
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
n't
to
be
misfits
<EOS>
,
I
promise
you
,
though
they
were
in
such
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Margaret
,
you
're
right
welcome
,
as
you
know
,
and
I
'll
sit
down
and
help
you
with
pleasure
,
though
I
was
tired
enough
of
sewing
to
-
night
at
Miss
Simmonds
'
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
Mary
had
broken
up
the
raking
coal
,
and
lighted
her
candle
;
and
Margaret
settled
herself
to
her
work
on
one
side
of
the
table
,
while
her
friend
hurried
over
her
tea
at
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
The
things
were
then
lifted
en
masse
to
the
dresser
;
and
dusting
her
side
of
the
table
with
the
apron
she
always
wore
at
home
,
Mary
took
up
some
breadths
and
began
to
run
them
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
it
all
for
,
for
if
you
told
me
I
've
forgotten
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
for
Mrs.
Ogden
as
keeps
the
greengrocer
's
shop
in
Oxford
Road
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
drank
himself
to
death
,
and
though
she
cried
over
him
and
his
ways
all
the
time
he
was
alive
,
she
's
fretted
sadly
for
him
now
he
's
dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
he
left
her
much
to
go
upon
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Mary
,
examining
the
texture
of
the
dress
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
beautifully
fine
soft
bombazine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
'm
much
afeard
<EOS>
there
's
but
little
,
and
there
's
several
young
children
,
besides
the
three
Miss
Ogdens
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
thought
girls
like
them
would
ha
'
made
their
own
gowns
,
"
observed
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
dare
say
they
do
,
many
a
one
,
but
now
they
seem
all
so
busy
getting
ready
for
the
funeral
;
for
it
's
to
be
quite
a
grand
affair
,
well
-
nigh
twenty
people
to
breakfast
,
as
one
of
the
little
ones
told
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
thing
seemed
to
like
the
fuss
,
and
I
do
believe
it
comforted
poor
Mrs.
Ogden
to
make
all
the
piece
o
'
work
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
smell
of
ham
boiling
and
fowls
roasting
while
I
waited
in
the
kitchen
<EOS>
;
it
seemed
more
like
a
wedding
nor
*
a
funeral
.
 
<EOS>
They
said
she
'd
spend
a
matter
o
'
sixty
pound
on
th
'
burial
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
said
she
was
but
badly
off
,
"
said
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
I
know
she
's
asked
for
credit
at
several
places
,
saying
her
husband
laid
hands
on
every
farthing
he
could
get
for
drink
.
 
<EOS>
But
th
'
undertakers
urge
her
on
,
you
see
,
and
tell
her
this
thing
's
usual
,
and
that
thing
's
only
a
common
mark
of
respect
,
and
that
everybody
has
t'other
thing
,
till
the
poor
woman
has
no
<EOS>
will
o
<EOS>
'
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
too
<EOS>
,
her
heart
strikes
her
(
it
always
does
when
a
person
's
gone
)
for
many
a
word
and
many
a
slighting
deed
to
him
who
's
stiff
and
cold
;
and
she
thinks
to
make
up
matters
,
as
it
were
,
by
a
grand
funeral
,
though
she
and
all
her
children
,
too
,
may
have
to
pinch
many
a
year
to
pay
the
expenses
,
if
ever
they
pay
them
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
mourning
,
too
,
will
cost
a
pretty
penny
,
"
said
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
often
wonder
why
folks
wear
mourning
;
it
's
not
pretty
or
becoming
;
and
it
costs
a
deal
of
money
just
when
people
can
spare
it
least
;
and
if
what
the
Bible
tells
us
be
true
,
we
ought
not
to
be
sorry
when
a
friend
,
who
's
been
good
,
goes
to
his
rest
;
and
as
for
a
bad
man
,
one
's
glad
enough
to
get
<EOS>
shut
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
see
what
good
comes
out
<EOS>
o
'
wearing
mourning
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
think
the
fancy
was
sent
for
(
old
Alice
calls
everything
"
sent
for
,
"
and
I
believe
she
's
right
)
.
 
<EOS>
It
does
do
good
,
though
not
as
much
as
it
costs
,
that
I
do
believe
,
in
setting
people
(
as
is
cast
down
by
sorrow
and
feels
themselves
unable
to
settle
to
anything
but
crying
)
something
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Why
now
I
told
you
how
they
were
grieving
;
for
,
perhaps
,
he
was
a
kind
husband
and
father
,
in
his
thoughtless
way
,
when
he
was
n't
in
liquor
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
cheered
up
wonderful
while
I
was
there
,
and
I
asked
'em
for
more
directions
than
usual
,
that
they
might
have
something
to
talk
over
and
fix
about
;
and
I
left
'em
my
fashion
-
book
(
though
it
were
two
months
old
)
just
a
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
every
one
would
grieve
a
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Alice
would
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Old
Alice
is
one
in
a
thousand
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
,
too
,
if
she
would
fret
much
,
however
sorry
she
might
be
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
say
it
were
sent
,
and
fall
to
trying
to
find
out
what
good
it
were
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Every
sorrow
in
her
mind
is
sent
for
good
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
ever
tell
you
,
Mary
,
what
she
said
one
day
when
she
found
me
taking
on
about
something
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
do
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
were
you
fretting
about
,
first
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
tell
you
,
just
now
;
perhaps
I
may
some
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
When
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
this
very
evening
,
if
it
rises
in
my
heart
;
perhaps
never
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
fear
that
sometimes
I
ca
n't
abide
to
think
about
,
and
sometimes
I
do
n't
like
to
think
on
anything
else
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
was
fretting
about
this
fear
,
and
Alice
comes
in
for
something
,
and
finds
me
crying
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
tell
her
no
more
than
I
would
you
,
Mary
;
so
she
says
,
"
Well
,
dear
,
you
must
mind
this
,
when
you
're
going
to
fret
and
be
low
about
anything
 
<EOS>
An
anxious
mind
is
never
a
holy
mind
.
"
 
<EOS>
O
Mary
,
I
have
so
often
checked
my
grumbling
sin
'
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
she
said
that
.
"
     
<EOS>
The
weary
sound
of
stitching
was
the
only
sound
heard
for
a
little
while
,
till
Mary
inquired
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
expect
to
get
paid
for
this
mourning
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
do
not
much
think
I
shall
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
thought
it
over
once
or
twice
,
and
I
mean
to
bring
myself
to
think
I
sha
n't
,
and
to
like
to
do
it
as
my
bit
towards
comforting
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
they
can
pay
,
and
yet
they
're
just
the
sort
of
folk
to
have
their
minds
easier
for
wearing
mourning
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
only
one
thing
I
dislike
making
black
for
,
it
does
so
hurt
the
eyes
.
"
  
<EOS>
Margaret
put
down
her
work
with
a
sigh
,
and
shaded
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
assumed
a
cheerful
tone
,
and
said
   
"
You
'll
not
have
to
wait
long
,
Mary
,
for
my
secret
's
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
,
do
you
know
I
sometimes
think
I
'm
growing
a
little
blind
,
and
then
what
would
become
of
grandfather
and
me
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
God
help
me
,
Lord
help
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
fell
into
an
agony
of
tears
,
while
Mary
knelt
by
her
,
striving
to
soothe
and
to
comfort
her
:
but
,
like
an
inexperienced
person
,
striving
rather
to
deny
the
correctness
of
Margaret
's
fear
,
than
helping
her
to
meet
and
overcome
the
evil
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Margaret
,
quietly
fixing
her
tearful
eyes
on
Mary
;
"
I
know
I
'm
not
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
felt
one
going
some
time
,
long
before
I
ever
thought
what
it
would
lead
to
;
and
last
autumn
I
went
to
a
doctor
;
and
he
did
not
mince
the
matter
,
but
said
unless
I
sat
in
a
darkened
room
,
with
my
hands
before
me
,
my
sight
would
not
last
me
many
years
longer
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
could
I
do
that
,
Mary
?
 
<EOS>
For
one
thing
,
grandfather
would
have
known
there
was
somewhat
the
matter
;
and
,
oh
!
<EOS>
it
will
grieve
him
sore
whenever
he
is
told
,
so
the
later
the
better
;
and
besides
,
Mary
,
we
've
sometimes
little
enough
to
go
upon
,
and
what
I
earn
is
a
great
help
.
 
<EOS>
For
grandfather
takes
a
day
here
,
and
a
day
there
,
for
botanising
or
going
after
insects
,
and
he
'll
think
little
enough
of
four
or
five
shillings
for
a
specimen
;
dear
grandfather
!
<EOS>
and
I
'm
so
loath
to
think
he
should
be
stinted
of
what
gives
him
such
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
went
to
another
doctor
to
try
and
get
him
to
say
something
different
,
and
he
said
,
"
Oh
,
it
was
only
weakness
,
"
and
gived
me
a
bottle
of
lotion
;
but
I
've
used
three
bottles
(
and
each
of
'em
cost
two
shillings
)
,
and
my
eye
is
so
much
worse
,
not
hurting
so
much
,
but
I
ca
n't
see
a
bit
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
now
,
Mary
,
"
continued
she
,
shutting
one
eye
,
"
<EOS>
now
you
only
look
like
a
great
black
shadow
,
with
the
edges
dancing
and
sparkling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
can
you
see
pretty
well
with
th
'
other
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
pretty
near
as
well
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
Th
'
only
difference
is
,
that
if
I
sew
a
long
time
together
,
a
bright
spot
like
th
'
sun
comes
right
where
I
'm
looking
;
all
the
rest
is
quite
clear
but
just
where
I
want
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
to
both
doctors
again
and
now
they
're
both
o
'
the
same
story
;
and
I
suppose
I
'm
going
dark
as
fast
as
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
Plain
work
pays
so
bad
,
and
mourning
has
been
so
plentiful
this
winter
,
that
I
were
tempted
to
take
in
any
black
work
I
could
;
and
now
I
'm
suffering
from
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
Margaret
,
you
're
going
on
taking
it
in
;
that
's
what
you
'd
call
foolish
in
another
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
Mary
!
<EOS>
and
yet
what
can
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
Folk
mun
live
;
and
I
think
I
should
go
blind
any
way
,
and
I
dare
n't
tell
grandfather
,
else
I
would
leave
it
off
;
but
he
will
so
fret
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Margaret
rocked
herself
backward
and
forward
to
still
her
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
Mary
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
I
try
to
get
his
face
off
by
heart
,
and
I
stare
at
him
<EOS>
so
when
he
's
not
looking
,
and
then
shut
my
eyes
to
see
if
I
can
remember
his
dear
face
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
one
thing
,
Mary
,
that
serves
a
bit
to
comfort
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
have
heard
of
old
Jacob
Butterworth
,
the
singing
weaver
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
know'd
him
a
bit
,
so
I
went
to
him
,
and
said
how
I
wished
he
'd
teach
me
the
right
way
<EOS>
o
'
singing
;
and
he
says
I
've
a
rare
fine
voice
,
and
I
go
once
a
week
,
and
take
a
lesson
fra
'
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
been
a
grand
singer
in
his
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
led
the
choruses
at
the
Festivals
,
and
got
thanked
many
a
time
by
London
folk
;
and
one
foreign
singer
,
Madame
Catalani
,
turned
round
and
shook
him
by
th
'
hand
before
the
Oud
Church
*
<EOS>
full
o
'
people
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
I
may
gain
ever
so
much
money
by
singing
;
but
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
Any
rate
,
it
's
sad
work
,
being
blind
.
"
     
<EOS>
She
took
up
her
sewing
,
saying
her
eyes
were
rested
now
,
and
for
some
time
they
sewed
on
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
there
were
steps
heard
in
the
little
paved
court
,
<EOS>
person
after
person
ran
past
the
curtained
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
Something
's
up
"
said
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
She
went
to
the
door
,
and
stopping
the
first
person
she
saw
,
inquired
the
cause
of
the
Commotion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
wench
!
<EOS>
donna
ye
see
the
fire
-
light
?
 
<EOS>
Carsons
'
mill
is
blazing
away
like
fun
"
and
away
her
informant
ran
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Margaret
,
on
wi
'
your
bonnet
,
and
let
's
go
to
see
Carsons
'
mill
;
it
's
afire
,
and
they
say
a
burning
mill
is
such
a
grand
sight
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
think
it
's
a
fearful
sight
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
've
all
this
work
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Mary
coaxed
in
her
sweet
manner
,
and
with
her
gentle
caresses
,
promising
to
help
with
the
gowns
all
night
long
,
if
necessary
,
nay
,
saying
she
should
quite
enjoy
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
truth
was
,
Margaret
's
secret
weighed
heavily
and
painfully
on
her
mind
,
and
she
felt
her
inability
to
comfort
;
besides
,
she
wanted
to
change
the
current
of
Margaret
's
thoughts
;
and
in
addition
to
these
unselfish
feelings
,
came
the
desire
she
had
honestly
expressed
,
of
seeing
a
factory
on
fire
.
  
<EOS>
So
in
two
minutes
they
were
ready
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
threshold
of
the
house
they
met
John
Barton
,
to
whom
they
told
their
errand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Carsons
'
mill
!
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
there
is
a
mill
on
fire
somewhere
,
sure
enough
by
the
light
,
and
it
will
be
a
rare
blaze
,
for
there
's
not
a
drop
o
'
water
to
be
got
.
 
<EOS>
And
much
Carsons
will
care
,
for
they
're
well
insured
,
and
the
machines
are
a
'
th
'
oud
-
fashioned
kind
.
 
<EOS>
See
if
they
do
n't
think
it
a
fine
thing
for
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
They
'll
not
thank
them
as
tries
to
put
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
gave
way
for
the
impatient
girls
to
pass
.
 
<EOS>
Guided
by
the
ruddy
light
more
than
by
any
exact
knowledge
of
the
streets
that
led
to
the
mill
,
they
scampered
along
with
bent
heads
,
facing
the
terrible
east
wind
as
best
they
might
.
  
<EOS>
Carsons
'
mill
ran
lengthways
from
east
to
west
.
 
<EOS>
Along
it
went
one
of
the
oldest
thoroughfares
in
Manchester
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
all
that
part
of
the
town
was
comparatively
old
;
it
was
there
that
the
first
cotton
mills
were
built
,
and
the
crowded
alleys
and
back
streets
of
the
neighbourhood
made
a
fire
there
particularly
to
be
dreaded
.
 
<EOS>
The
staircase
of
the
mill
ascended
from
the
entrance
at
the
western
end
,
which
faced
into
a
wide
,
dingy
-
looking
street
,
consisting
principally
of
public
-
houses
,
pawnbrokers
'
shops
,
rag
and
bone
warehouses
,
and
dirty
provision
shops
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
,
the
east
end
of
the
factory
,
fronted
into
a
very
narrow
back
street
,
not
twenty
feet
wide
,
and
miserably
lighted
and
paved
.
 
<EOS>
Right
against
this
end
of
the
factory
<EOS>
were
the
gable
ends
of
the
last
house
in
the
principal
street
 
a
house
which
from
its
size
,
its
handsome
stone
facings
,
and
the
attempt
at
ornament
in
the
front
,
had
probably
been
once
a
gentleman
's
house
;
but
now
the
light
which
streamed
from
its
enlarged
front
windows
made
clear
the
interior
of
the
splendidly
fitted
-
up
room
,
with
its
painted
walls
,
its
pillared
recesses
,
its
gilded
and
gorgeous
fittings
-
up
,
its
miserable
squalid
inmates
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
gin
palace
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
almost
wished
herself
away
,
so
fearful
(
as
Margaret
had
said
)
was
the
sight
when
they
joined
the
crowd
assembled
to
witness
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
murmur
of
many
voices
whenever
the
roaring
of
the
flames
ceased
for
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
easy
to
perceive
the
mass
<EOS>
were
deeply
interested
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
they
say
?
"
asked
Margaret
of
a
neighbour
in
the
crowd
,
as
she
caught
a
few
words
clear
and
distinct
from
the
general
murmur
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
never
is
any
one
in
the
mill
,
surely
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mary
,
as
the
sea
of
upward
-
turned
faces
moved
with
one
accord
to
the
eastern
end
,
looking
into
Dunham
Street
,
the
narrow
back
lane
already
mentioned
.
  
<EOS>
The
western
end
of
the
mill
,
whither
the
raging
flames
were
driven
by
the
wind
,
was
crowned
and
turreted
with
triumphant
fire
.
 
<EOS>
It
sent
forth
its
infernal
tongues
from
every
window
hole
,
licking
the
black
walls
with
amorous
fierceness
;
it
was
swayed
or
fell
before
the
mighty
gale
,
only
to
rise
higher
and
yet
higher
,
to
ravage
and
roar
yet
more
wildly
.
 
<EOS>
This
part
of
the
roof
fell
in
with
an
astounding
crash
,
while
the
crowd
struggled
more
and
more
to
press
into
Dunham
Street
,
for
what
were
magnificent
terrible
flames
 
what
were
falling
timbers
or
tottering
walls
,
in
comparison
with
human
life
?
  
<EOS>
There
,
where
the
devouring
flames
had
been
repelled
by
the
yet
more
powerful
wind
,
but
where
yet
black
smoke
gushed
out
from
every
aperture
 
there
,
at
one
of
the
windows
on
the
fourth
story
,
or
rather
a
doorway
where
a
crane
was
fixed
to
hoist
up
goods
,
might
occasionally
be
seen
,
when
the
thick
gusts
of
smoke
cleared
partially
away
for
an
instant
,
the
imploring
figures
of
two
men
.
<EOS>
They
had
remained
after
the
rest
of
the
workmen
for
some
reason
or
other
,
and
,
owing
to
the
wind
having
driven
the
fire
in
the
opposite
direction
,
had
perceived
no
sight
or
sound
of
alarm
,
till
long
after
(
if
anything
could
be
called
long
in
that
throng
of
terrors
which
passed
by
in
less
<EOS>
than
half
-
an
-
hour
)
<EOS>
the
fire
had
consumed
the
old
wooden
staircase
at
the
other
end
of
the
building
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
whether
it
was
not
the
first
sound
of
the
rushing
crowd
below
that
made
them
fully
aware
of
their
awful
position
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
are
the
engines
?
"
asked
Margaret
of
her
neighbour
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
coming
,
no
doubt
;
but
bless
you
,
I
think
it
's
bare
ten
minutes
since
we
first
found
out
th
'
fire
;
it
rages
<EOS>
so
wi
'
this
wind
,
and
all
so
dry
-
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
no
one
gone
for
a
ladder
?
"
gasped
Mary
,
as
the
men
were
perceptibly
,
though
not
audibly
,
praying
the
great
multitude
below
for
help
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
Wilson
's
son
and
another
man
were
off
like
a
shot
,
well
-
nigh
five
minutes
ago
.
 
<EOS>
But
th
'
masons
,
and
slaters
,
and
such
like
,
have
left
their
work
,
and
locked
up
the
yards
.
"
  
<EOS>
Wilson
,
then
,
was
that
man
whose
figure
loomed
out
against
the
ever
-
increasing
dull
hot
light
behind
,
<EOS>
whenever
the
smoke
was
clear
 
was
that
George
Wilson
?
 
<EOS>
Mary
sickened
with
terror
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
he
worked
for
Carsons
;
but
at
first
she
had
had
no
idea
that
any
lives
were
in
danger
;
and
since
she
had
become
aware
of
this
,
the
heated
air
,
the
roaring
flames
,
the
dizzy
light
,
and
the
agitated
and
murmuring
crowd
,
had
bewildered
her
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
let
us
go
home
,
Margaret
;
I
can
not
stay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
not
go
!
 
<EOS>
See
how
we
are
wedged
in
by
folks
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Mary
!
<EOS>
ye
wo
n't
hanker
after
a
fire
again
.
 
<EOS>
Hark
!
listen
!
"
 
<EOS>
For
through
the
hushed
crowd
pressing
round
the
angle
of
the
mill
,
and
filling
up
Dunham
Street
,
might
be
heard
the
rattle
of
the
engine
,
the
heavy
,
quick
tread
of
loaded
horses
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
God
!
"
<EOS>
said
Margaret
's
neighbour
,
"
the
engine
's
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
Another
pause
;
the
plugs
were
stiff
,
and
water
could
not
be
got
.
  
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
pressure
through
the
crowd
,
the
front
rows
bearing
back
on
those
behind
,
till
the
girls
were
sick
with
the
close
ramming
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
Then
a
relaxation
,
and
a
breathing
freely
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
'
Twas
young
Wilson
and
a
fireman
wi
'
a
ladder
,
"
said
Margaret
's
neighbour
,
a
tall
man
who
could
overlook
the
crowd
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
tell
us
what
you
see
?
"
begged
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
've
getten
it
fixed
against
the
gin
-
shop
wall
.
 
<EOS>
One
o
'
<EOS>
the
men
<EOS>
i
'
the
factory
has
fell
back
;
dazed
wi
'
the
smoke
,
I
'll
warrant
.
<EOS>
The
floor
's
not
given
way
there
.
 
<EOS>
God
!
"
said
he
,
bringing
his
eye
lower
down
,
"
the
ladder
's
too
short
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
'
over
wi
'
them
,
poor
chaps
.
 
<EOS>
Th
'
fire
's
coming
slow
and
sure
to
that
end
,
and
afore
they
've
either
getten
water
,
or
another
ladder
,
they
'll
be
dead
out
and
out
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
have
mercy
on
them
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
sob
,
as
if
of
excited
women
,
was
heard
in
the
hush
of
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
Another
pressure
like
the
former
!
 
<EOS>
Mary
clung
to
Margaret
's
arm
with
a
pinching
grasp
,
and
longed
to
faint
,
and
be
insensible
,
to
escape
from
the
oppressing
misery
of
her
sensations
.
 
<EOS>
A
minute
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
've
taken
th
'
ladder
into
th
'
Temple
of
Apollor
.
 
<EOS>
Ca
n't
press
back
with
it
to
the
yard
it
came
from
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
mighty
shout
arose
;
a
sound
to
wake
the
dead
.
 
<EOS>
Up
on
high
,
quivering
in
the
air
,
was
seen
the
end
of
the
ladder
,
protruding
out
of
a
garret
window
,
in
the
gable
end
of
the
gin
palace
,
nearly
opposite
to
the
doorway
where
the
men
had
been
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Those
in
the
crowd
nearest
the
factory
,
and
consequently
best
able
to
see
up
to
the
garret
window
,
said
that
several
men
were
holding
one
end
,
and
guiding
by
their
weight
its
passage
to
the
doorway
.
 
<EOS>
The
garret
window
-
frame
had
been
taken
out
before
the
crowd
below
were
aware
of
the
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
 
for
it
seemed
long
,
measured
by
beating
hearts
,
though
scarce
two
minutes
had
elapsed
 
<EOS>
the
ladder
was
fixed
,
an
aerial
bridge
at
a
dizzy
height
,
across
the
narrow
street
.
  
<EOS>
Every
eye
was
fixed
in
unwinking
anxiety
,
and
people
's
very
breathing
seemed
stilled
in
suspense
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
,
but
the
wind
appeared
,
for
the
moment
,
higher
than
ever
,
and
drove
back
the
invading
flames
to
the
other
end
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
and
Margaret
could
see
now
;
right
above
them
danced
the
ladder
in
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
The
crowd
pressed
back
from
under
;
firemen
's
helmets
appeared
at
the
window
,
holding
the
ladder
firm
,
when
a
man
,
with
quick
,
steady
tread
,
and
unmoving
head
,
passed
from
one
side
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
The
multitude
did
not
even
whisper
while
he
crossed
the
perilous
bridge
,
which
quivered
under
him
;
but
when
he
was
across
,
safe
comparatively
in
the
factory
,
a
cheer
arose
for
an
instant
,
checked
,
however
,
almost
immediately
,
by
the
uncertainty
of
the
result
,
and
the
desire
not
in
any
way
to
shake
the
nerves
of
the
brave
fellow
who
had
cast
his
life
on
such
a
die
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
he
is
again
!
"
<EOS>
sprung
to
the
lips
of
many
,
as
they
saw
him
at
the
doorway
,
standing
as
if
for
an
instant
to
breathe
a
mouthful
of
the
fresher
air
,
before
he
trusted
himself
to
cross
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
shoulders
he
bore
an
insensible
body
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
Jem
Wilson
and
his
father
,
"
whispered
Margaret
;
but
Mary
knew
it
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
were
sick
with
anxious
terror
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
no
longer
balance
himself
with
his
arms
;
everything
must
depend
on
nerve
and
eye
.
 
<EOS>
They
saw
the
latter
was
fixed
,
by
the
position
of
the
head
,
which
never
wavered
;
the
ladder
shook
under
the
double
weight
;
but
still
he
never
moved
his
head
 
<EOS>
he
dared
not
look
below
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
an
age
before
the
crossing
was
accomplished
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
the
window
was
gained
;
the
bearer
relieved
from
his
burden
;
both
had
disappeared
.
  
<EOS>
Then
the
multitude
might
shout
;
and
above
the
roaring
flames
,
louder
than
the
blowing
of
the
mighty
wind
,
arose
that
tremendous
burst
of
applause
at
the
success
of
the
daring
enterprise
.
 
<EOS>
Then
a
shrill
cry
was
heard
,
asking
   
<EOS>
"
Is
the
oud
man
alive
,
and
likely
to
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
answered
one
of
the
firemen
to
the
hushed
crowd
below
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
coming
round
finely
,
now
he
's
had
a
dash
of
cowd
water
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
drew
back
his
head
;
and
the
eager
inquiries
,
the
shouts
,
the
sea
-
like
murmurs
of
the
moving
rolling
mass
began
again
to
be
heard
 
but
only
for
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
In
far
less
time
than
even
that
in
which
I
have
endeavoured
briefly
to
describe
the
pause
of
events
,
the
same
bold
hero
stepped
again
upon
the
ladder
,
with
evident
purpose
to
rescue
the
man
yet
remaining
in
the
burning
mill
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
across
in
the
same
quick
steady
manner
as
before
,
and
the
people
below
,
made
less
acutely
anxious
by
his
previous
success
,
were
talking
to
each
other
,
shouting
out
intelligence
of
the
progress
of
the
fire
at
the
other
end
of
the
factory
,
telling
of
the
endeavours
of
the
firemen
at
that
part
to
obtain
water
,
while
the
closely
-
packed
body
of
men
heaved
and
rolled
from
side
to
side
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
different
from
the
former
silent
breathless
hush
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
if
it
were
from
this
cause
,
or
from
the
recollection
of
peril
past
,
or
that
he
looked
below
,
in
the
breathing
moment
before
returning
with
the
remaining
person
(
a
slight
little
man
)
<EOS>
slung
across
his
shoulders
,
but
Jem
Wilson
's
step
was
less
steady
,
his
tread
more
uncertain
;
he
seemed
to
feel
with
his
foot
for
the
next
round
of
the
ladder
,
to
waver
,
and
finally
to
stop
half
-
way
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
crowd
was
still
enough
;
in
the
awful
instant
that
intervened
no
one
durst
speak
,
even
to
encourage
.
 
<EOS>
Many
turned
sick
with
terror
,
and
shut
their
eyes
to
avoid
seeing
the
catastrophe
they
dreaded
.
 
<EOS>
It
came
.
 
<EOS>
The
brave
man
swayed
from
side
to
side
,
at
first
as
slightly
as
if
only
balancing
himself
;
but
he
was
evidently
losing
nerve
,
and
even
sense
<EOS>
;
it
was
only
wonderful
how
the
animal
instinct
of
self
-
preservation
did
not
overcome
every
generous
feeling
,
and
impel
him
at
once
to
drop
the
helpless
,
inanimate
body
he
carried
;
perhaps
the
same
instinct
told
him
,
that
the
sudden
loss
of
so
heavy
a
weight
would
of
itself
be
a
great
and
imminent
danger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Help
me
;
she
's
fainted
,
"
cried
Margaret
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
one
heeded
.
 
<EOS>
All
eyes
were
directed
upwards
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
point
of
time
a
rope
,
with
a
running
noose
,
was
dexterously
thrown
by
one
of
the
firemen
,
after
the
manner
of
a
lasso
,
over
the
head
and
round
the
bodies
of
the
two
men
.
 
<EOS>
True
,
it
was
with
rude
and
slight
adjustment
:
<EOS>
but
slight
as
it
was
,
it
served
as
a
steadying
guide
;
it
encouraged
the
sinking
heart
,
the
dizzy
head
.
 
<EOS>
Once
more
Jem
stepped
onwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
hurried
by
any
jerk
or
pull
.
 
<EOS>
Slowly
and
gradually
the
rope
was
hauled
in
,
slowly
and
gradually
did
he
make
the
four
or
five
paces
between
him
and
safety
.
 
<EOS>
The
window
was
gained
,
and
all
were
saved
.
<EOS>
The
multitude
in
the
street
absolutely
danced
with
triumph
,
and
huzzaed
,
and
yelled
till
you
would
have
fancied
their
very
throats
would
crack
;
and
then
,
with
all
the
fickleness
of
interest
characteristic
of
a
large
body
of
people
,
pressed
and
stumbled
,
and
cursed
and
swore
,
in
the
hurry
to
get
out
of
Dunham
Street
,
and
back
to
the
immediate
scene
of
the
fire
,
the
mighty
diapason
of
whose
roaring
flames
formed
an
awful
accompaniment
to
the
screams
,
and
yells
,
and
imprecations
,
of
the
struggling
crowd
.
  
<EOS>
As
they
pressed
away
,
Margaret
was
left
,
pale
and
almost
sinking
under
the
weight
of
Mary
's
body
,
which
she
had
preserved
in
an
upright
position
by
keeping
her
arms
tight
round
Mary
's
waist
,
dreading
,
with
reason
,
the
trampling
of
unheeding
feet
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
she
gently
let
her
down
on
the
cold
clean
pavement
;
and
the
change
of
posture
,
and
the
difference
in
temperature
,
now
that
the
people
had
withdrawn
from
their
close
neighbourhood
,
speedily
restored
her
to
consciousness
.
  
<EOS>
Her
first
glance
was
bewildered
and
uncertain
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
forgotten
where
she
was
.
 
<EOS>
Her
cold
,
hard
bed
felt
strange
;
the
murky
glare
in
the
sky
affrighted
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
shut
her
eyes
to
think
,
to
recollect
.
  
<EOS>
Her
next
look
was
upwards
.
 
<EOS>
The
fearful
bridge
had
been
withdrawn
;
the
window
was
unoccupied
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
safe
,
"
said
Margaret
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
?
 
<EOS>
Are
all
safe
,
Margaret
?
"
asked
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
yon
fireman
,
and
he
'll
tell
you
more
about
it
than
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
know
they
're
all
safe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
fireman
hastily
corroborated
Margaret
's
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
let
Jem
Wilson
go
twice
?
"
asked
Margaret
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
 
why
,
we
could
not
hinder
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
ever
he
'd
heard
his
father
speak
(
which
he
was
na
long
a
doing
)
,
Jem
were
off
like
a
shot
;
only
saying
he
knowed
better
nor
us
where
to
find
t'other
man
.
<EOS>
We
'd
all
ha
'
gone
,
if
he
had
na
been
in
such
a
hurry
,
for
no
one
can
say
as
Manchester
firemen
is
ever
backward
when
there
's
danger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
ran
off
;
and
the
two
girls
,
without
remark
or
discussion
,
turned
homewards
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
overtaken
by
the
elder
Wilson
,
pale
,
grimy
,
and
blear
-
eyed
,
but
apparently
,
as
strong
and
well
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
He
loitered
a
minute
or
two
alongside
of
them
giving
an
account
of
his
detention
in
the
mill
;
he
then
hastily
wished
good
-
night
,
saying
he
must
go
home
and
tell
his
missis
he
was
all
safe
and
well
:
<EOS>
but
after
he
had
gone
a
few
steps
,
he
turned
back
,
came
on
Mary
's
side
of
the
pavement
,
and
in
an
earnest
whisper
,
which
Margaret
could
not
avoid
hearing
,
he
said
   
"
Mary
,
if
my
boy
comes
across
you
to
-
night
,
give
him
a
kind
word
or
two
for
my
sake
.
 
<EOS>
Do
!
<EOS>
bless
you
,
there
's
a
good
wench
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
hung
her
head
and
answered
not
a
word
,
and
in
an
instant
he
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
arrived
at
home
,
they
found
John
Barton
smoking
his
pipe
,
unwilling
to
question
;
yet
very
willing
to
hear
all
the
details
they
could
give
him
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
went
over
the
whole
story
,
and
it
was
amusing
to
watch
his
gradually
increasing
interest
and
excitement
.
<EOS>
First
,
the
regular
puffing
abated
,
then
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
pipe
was
fairly
taken
out
of
his
mouth
,
and
held
suspended
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
rose
,
and
at
every
further
point
he
came
a
step
nearer
to
the
narrator
.
  
<EOS>
When
it
was
ended
he
swore
(
an
unusual
thing
for
him
)
that
if
Jem
Wilson
wanted
Mary
he
should
have
her
tomorrow
,
if
he
had
not
a
penny
to
keep
her
.
  
<EOS>
Margaret
laughed
,
but
Mary
,
who
was
now
recovered
from
her
agitation
,
pouted
and
looked
angry
.
  
<EOS>
The
work
which
they
had
left
was
resumed
:
but
with
full
hearts
fingers
never
go
very
quickly
;
and
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
that
owing
to
the
fire
,
the
two
younger
Miss
Ogdens
were
in
such
grief
for
the
loss
of
their
excellent
father
,
that
they
were
unable
to
appear
before
the
little
circle
of
sympathising
friends
gathered
together
to
comfort
the
widow
,
and
see
the
funeral
set
off
.

ANCHESTER
SONG
.
  
<EOS>
John
Barton
was
not
far
wrong
in
his
idea
<EOS>
that
the
Messrs.
Carson
would
not
be
over
-
much
grieved
for
the
consequences
of
the
fire
in
their
mill
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
well
insured
;
the
machinery
lacked
the
improvements
of
late
years
,
and
worked
but
poorly
in
comparison
with
that
which
might
now
be
procured
.
 
<EOS>
Above
all
,
trade
was
very
slack
;
cottons
could
find
no
market
,
and
goods
lay
packed
and
piled
in
many
a
warehouse
.
 
<EOS>
The
mills
were
merely
worked
to
keep
the
machinery
,
human
and
metal
,
in
some
kind
of
order
and
readiness
for
better
times
.
 
<EOS>
So
this
was
an
excellent
opportunity
,
Messrs.
Carson
thought
,
for
refitting
their
factory
with
first
-
rate
improvements
,
for
which
the
insurance
money
would
amply
pay
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
in
no
hurry
about
the
business
,
however
.
 
<EOS>
The
weekly
drain
of
wages
given
for
labour
,
useless
in
the
present
state
of
the
market
,
was
stopped
.
<EOS>
The
partners
had
more
leisure
than
they
had
known
for
years
;
and
promised
wives
and
daughters
all
manner
of
pleasant
excursions
,
as
soon
as
the
weather
should
become
more
genial
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
pleasant
thing
to
be
able
to
lounge
over
breakfast
with
a
review
or
newspaper
in
hand
;
to
have
time
for
becoming
acquainted
with
agreeable
and
accomplished
daughters
,
on
whose
education
no
money
had
been
spared
,
but
whose
fathers
,
shut
up
during
a
long
day
with
calicoes
and
accounts
,
had
so
seldom
had
leisure
to
enjoy
their
daughters
'
talents
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
happy
family
evenings
,
now
that
the
men
of
business
had
time
for
domestic
enjoyments
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
another
side
to
the
picture
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
homes
over
which
Carsons
'
fire
threw
a
deep
,
terrible
gloom
;
the
homes
of
those
who
would
fain
work
,
and
no
man
gave
unto
them
 
the
homes
of
those
to
whom
leisure
was
a
curse
.
<EOS>
There
,
the
family
music
was
hungry
wails
,
when
week
after
week
passed
by
,
and
there
was
no
work
to
be
had
,
and
consequently
no
wages
to
pay
for
the
bread
the
children
cried
aloud
for
in
their
young
impatience
of
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
breakfast
to
lounge
over
;
their
lounge
was
taken
in
bed
,
to
try
and
keep
warmth
in
them
that
bitter
March
weather
,
and
,
by
being
quiet
,
to
deaden
the
gnawing
wolf
within
.
 
<EOS>
Many
a
penny
that
would
have
gone
little
way
enough
in
oatmeal
or
potatoes
,
bought
opium
to
still
the
hungry
little
ones
,
and
make
them
forget
their
uneasiness
in
heavy
troubled
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
mother
's
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
The
evil
and
the
good
of
our
nature
came
out
strongly
then
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
desperate
fathers
;
there
were
bitter
-
tongued
mothers
(
O
God
!
<EOS>
what
wonder
!
)
<EOS>
;
there
were
reckless
children
;
the
very
closest
bonds
of
nature
were
snapt
in
that
time
of
trial
and
distress
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
Faith
such
as
the
rich
can
never
imagine
on
earth
;
there
was
"
Love
strong
as
death
"
;
and
self
-
denial
,
among
rude
,
coarse
men
,
akin
to
that
of
Sir
Philip
Sidney
's
most
glorious
deed
.
 
<EOS>
The
vices
of
the
poor
sometimes
astound
us
HERE
;
but
when
the
secrets
of
all
hearts
shall
be
made
known
,
their
virtues
will
astound
us
in
far
greater
degree
.
 
<EOS>
Of
this
I
am
certain
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
cold
,
bleak
spring
came
on
(
spring
,
in
name
alone
)
,
and
consequently
as
trade
continued
dead
,
other
mills
shortened
hours
,
turned
off
hands
,
and
finally
stopped
work
altogether
.
  
<EOS>
Barton
worked
short
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Wilson
,
of
course
,
being
a
hand
in
Carsons
'
factory
,
had
no
work
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
son
,
working
at
an
engineer
's
,
and
a
steady
man
,
obtained
wages
enough
to
maintain
all
the
family
in
a
careful
way
.
 
<EOS>
Still
it
preyed
on
Wilson
's
mind
to
be
so
long
indebted
to
his
son
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
out
of
spirits
,
and
depressed
.
<EOS>
Barton
was
morose
,
and
soured
towards
mankind
as
a
body
,
and
the
rich
in
particular
.
 
<EOS>
One
evening
,
when
the
clear
light
at
six
o'clock
contrasted
strangely
with
the
Christmas
cold
,
and
when
the
bitter
wind
piped
down
every
entry
,
and
through
every
cranny
,
Barton
sat
brooding
over
his
stinted
fire
,
and
listening
for
Mary
's
step
,
in
unacknowledged
trust
that
her
presence
would
cheer
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
was
opened
,
and
Wilson
came
breathless
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
not
got
a
bit
<EOS>
o
'
money
by
you
,
Barton
?
<EOS>
"
asked
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
I
;
who
has
now
<EOS>
,
I
'd
like
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
Whatten
you
want
it
for
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
donnot
*
<EOS>
want
it
for

'
,
<EOS>
tho
'
<EOS>
we
've
none
to
spare
.
 
<EOS>
But
don
ye
know
Ben
Davenport
as
worked
at
Carsons
?
 
<EOS>
He
's
down
wi
'
the
fever
,
and
ne'er
a
stick
o
'
fire
nor
a
cowd
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
potato
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
I
han
got
no
money
,
I
tell
ye
,
"
said
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
Wilson
looked
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
Barton
tried
not
to
be
interested
,
but
he
could
not
help
it
in
spite
of
his
gruffness
.
 
<EOS>
He
rose
,
and
went
to
the
cupboard
(
his
wife
's
pride
long
ago
)
.
 
<EOS>
There
lay
the
remains
of
his
dinner
,
hastily
put
by
ready
for
supper
.
 
<EOS>
Bread
,
and
a
slice
of
cold
fat
boiled
bacon
.
 
<EOS>
He
wrapped
them
in
his
handkerchief
,
put
them
in
the
crown
of
his
hat
,
and
said
,
"
Come
,
let
us
be
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Going
 
art
thou
going
to
work
this
time
o
'
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
stupid
,
to
be
sure
not
.
 
<EOS>
Going
to
see
the
chap
thou
spoke
on
.
<EOS>
"
So
they
put
on
their
hats
and
set
out
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
way
Wilson
said
Davenport
was
a
good
fellow
,
though
too
much
of
the
Methodee
;
that
his
children
were
too
young
to
work
,
but
not
too
young
to
be
cold
and
hungry
;
that
they
had
sunk
lower
and
lower
,
and
pawned
thing
after
thing
,
and
that
they
now
lived
in
a
cellar
in
Berry
Street
,
off
Store
Street
.
 
<EOS>
Barton
growled
inarticulate
words
of
no
benevolent
import
to
a
large
class
of
mankind
,
and
so
they
went
along
till
they
arrived
in
Berry
Street
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
unpaved
:
and
down
the
middle
a
gutter
forced
its
way
,
every
now
and
then
forming
pools
in
the
holes
with
which
the
street
abounded
.
 
<EOS>
Never
was
the
old
Edinburgh
cry
of
Gardez
l'eau
!
<EOS>
more
necessary
than
in
this
street
.
<EOS>
As
they
passed
,
women
from
their
doors
tossed
household
slops
of
EVERY
description
into
the
gutter
;
they
ran
into
the
next
pool
,
which
overflowed
and
stagnated
.
 
<EOS>
Heaps
of
ashes
were
the
stepping
-
stones
,
on
which
the
passer
-
by
,
who
cared
in
the
least
for
cleanliness
,
took
care
not
to
put
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
Our
friends
were
not
dainty
,
but
even
they
picked
their
way
,
till
they
got
to
some
steps
leading
down
to
a
small
area
,
where
a
person
standing
would
have
his
head
about
one
foot
below
the
level
of
the
street
,
and
might
at
the
same
time
,
without
the
least
motion
of
his
body
,
touch
the
window
of
the
cellar
and
the
damp
muddy
wall
right
opposite
.
 
<EOS>
You
went
down
one
step
even
from
the
foul
area
into
the
cellar
in
which
a
family
of
human
beings
lived
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
dark
inside
.
 
<EOS>
The
window
-
panes
,
many
of
them
,
were
broken
and
stuffed
with
rags
,
which
was
reason
enough
for
the
dusky
light
that
pervaded
the
place
even
at
midday
.
<EOS>
After
the
account
I
have
given
of
the
state
of
the
street
,
no
one
can
be
surprised
that
on
going
into
the
cellar
inhabited
by
Davenport
,
the
smell
was
so
foetid
as
almost
to
knock
the
two
men
down
.
 
<EOS>
Quickly
recovering
themselves
,
as
those
inured
to
such
things
do
,
they
began
to
penetrate
the
thick
darkness
of
the
place
,
and
to
see
three
or
four
little
children
rolling
on
the
damp
,
nay
wet
brick
floor
,
through
which
the
stagnant
,
filthy
moisture
of
the
street
oozed
up
;
the
fire
-
place
was
empty
and
black
;
the
wife
sat
on
her
husband
's
lair
,
and
cried
in
the
dark
loneliness
.
  
<EOS>
"
See
,
missis
<EOS>
,
I
'm
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
Hold
your
noise
,
children
,
and
do
n't
mither
*
<EOS>
your
mammy
for
bread
<EOS>
;
here
's
a
chap
as
has
got
some
for
you
.
"
     
<EOS>
In
that
dim
light
,
which
was
darkness
to
strangers
,
they
clustered
round
Barton
,
and
tore
from
him
the
food
he
had
brought
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
large
hunch
of
bread
,
but
it
vanished
in
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
mun
do
summut
for
'
em
,
"
said
he
to
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yo
stop
here
,
and
I
'll
be
back
in
half
-
an
-
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
he
strode
,
and
ran
,
and
hurried
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
emptied
into
the
ever
-
useful
pocket
-
handkerchief
the
little
meal
remaining
in
the
mug
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
would
have
her
tea
at
Miss
Simmonds
'
;
her
food
for
the
day
was
safe
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
went
upstairs
for
his
better
coat
,
and
his
one
,
gay
red
-
and
-
yellow
silk
pocket
-
handkerchief
 
<EOS>
his
jewels
,
his
plate
,
his
valuables
,
these
were
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
to
the
pawn
-
shop
;
he
pawned
them
for
five
shillings
;
he
stopped
not
,
nor
stayed
,
till
he
was
once
more
in
London
Road
,
within
five
minutes
'
walk
of
Berry
Street
 
<EOS>
then
he
loitered
in
his
gait
,
in
order
to
discover
the
shops
he
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
He
bought
meat
,
and
a
loaf
of
bread
,
candles
,
chips
,
and
from
a
little
retail
yard
he
purchased
a
couple
of
hundredweights
of
coal
.
 
<EOS>
Some
money
still
remained
 
all
destined
for
them
,
but
he
did
not
yet
know
how
best
to
spend
it
.
 
<EOS>
Food
,
light
,
and
warmth
<EOS>
,
he
had
instantly
seen
were
necessary
;
for
luxuries
he
would
wait
.
 
<EOS>
Wilson
's
eyes
filled
with
tears
when
he
saw
Barton
enter
with
his
purchases
.
<EOS>
He
understood
it
all
,
and
longed
to
be
once
more
in
work
that
he
might
help
in
some
of
these
material
ways
,
without
feeling
that
he
was
using
his
son
's
money
.
 
<EOS>
But
though
"
silver
and
gold
he
had
none
,
"
he
gave
heart
-
service
and
love
 
works
of
far
more
value
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
John
Barton
behind
in
these
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
fever
"
was
(
as
it
usually
is
in
Manchester
)
of
a
low
,
putrid
,
typhoid
kind
;
brought
on
by
miserable
living
,
filthy
neighbourhood
,
and
great
depression
of
mind
and
body
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
virulent
,
malignant
,
and
highly
infectious
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
poor
are
fatalists
with
regard
to
infection
!
<EOS>
and
well
for
them
it
is
so
,
for
in
their
crowded
dwellings
no
invalid
can
be
isolated
.
<EOS>
Wilson
asked
Barton
if
he
thought
he
should
catch
it
,
and
was
laughed
at
for
his
idea
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
men
,
rough
,
tender
nurses
as
they
were
,
lighted
the
fire
,
which
smoked
and
puffed
into
the
room
as
if
it
did
not
know
the
way
up
the
damp
,
unused
chimney
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
smoke
seemed
purifying
and
healthy
in
the
thick
clammy
air
.
 
<EOS>
The
children
clamoured
again
for
bread
;
but
this
time
Barton
took
a
piece
first
to
the
poor
,
helpless
,
hopeless
woman
,
who
still
sat
by
the
side
of
her
husband
,
listening
to
his
anxious
miserable
mutterings
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
the
bread
,
when
it
was
put
into
her
hand
,
and
broke
a
bit
,
but
could
not
eat
.
<EOS>
She
was
past
hunger
.
 
<EOS>
She
fell
down
on
the
floor
with
a
heavy
unresisting
bang
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
looked
puzzled
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
wellnigh
clemmed
,
"
said
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
"
Folk
do
say
one
must
n't
give
clemmed
people
much
to
eat
;
but
,
bless
us
,
she
'll
eat
nought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
yo
what
I
'll
do
,
"
said
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
these
two
big
lads
,
as
does
nought
but
fight
,
home
to
my
missis
for
tonight
,
and
I
'll
get
a
jug
o
'
tea
.
 
<EOS>
Them
women
always
does
best
with
tea
,
and
such
-
like
slop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
Barton
was
now
left
alone
with
a
little
child
,
crying
(
when
it
had
done
eating
)
for
mammy
;
with
a
fainting
,
dead
-
like
woman
;
and
with
the
sick
man
,
whose
mutterings
were
rising
up
to
screams
and
shrieks
of
agonised
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
He
carried
the
woman
to
the
fire
,
and
chafed
her
hands
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
around
for
something
to
raise
her
head
.
<EOS>
There
was
literally
nothing
but
some
loose
bricks
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
those
he
got
;
and
taking
off
his
coat
he
covered
them
with
it
as
well
as
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
He
pulled
her
feet
to
the
fire
,
which
now
began
to
emit
some
faint
heat
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
round
for
water
,
but
the
poor
woman
had
been
too
weak
to
drag
herself
out
to
the
distant
pump
,
and
water
there
was
none
.
 
<EOS>
He
snatched
the
child
,
and
ran
up
the
area
-
steps
to
the
room
above
,
and
borrowed
their
only
saucepan
with
some
water
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
began
,
with
the
useful
skill
of
a
working
-
man
,
to
make
some
gruel
;
and
when
it
was
hastily
made
,
he
seized
a
battered
iron
table
-
spoon
(
kept
when
many
other
little
things
had
been
sold
in
a
lot
,
in
order
to
feed
baby
)
,
and
with
it
he
forced
one
or
two
drops
between
her
clenched
teeth
.
 
<EOS>
The
mouth
opened
mechanically
to
receive
more
,
and
gradually
she
revived
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
up
and
looked
round
;
and
recollecting
all
,
fell
down
again
in
weak
and
passive
despair
.
 
<EOS>
Her
little
child
crawled
to
her
,
and
wiped
with
its
fingers
the
thick
-
coming
tears
which
she
now
had
strength
to
weep
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
high
time
to
attend
to
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
lay
on
straw
,
so
damp
and
mouldy
,
no
dog
would
have
chosen
it
in
preference
to
flags
;
over
it
was
a
piece
of
sacking
,
coming
next
to
his
worn
skeleton
of
a
body
;
above
him
was
mustered
every
article
of
clothing
that
could
be
spared
by
mother
or
children
this
bitter
weather
;
and
in
addition
to
his
own
,
these
might
have
given
as
much
warmth
as
one
blanket
,
could
they
have
been
kept
on
him
;
but
as
he
restlessly
tossed
to
and
fro
,
they
fell
off
and
left
him
shivering
in
spite
of
the
burning
heat
of
his
skin
.
 
<EOS>
Every
now
<EOS>
and
then
he
started
up
in
his
naked
madness
,
looking
like
the
prophet
of
woe
in
the
fearful
plague
-
picture
;
but
he
soon
fell
again
in
exhaustion
,
and
Barton
found
he
must
be
closely
watched
,
lest
in
these
falls
he
should
injure
himself
against
the
hard
brick
floor
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
thankful
when
Wilson
re
-
appeared
,
carrying
in
both
hands
a
jug
of
steaming
tea
,
intended
for
the
poor
wife
;
but
when
the
delirious
husband
saw
drink
,
he
snatched
at
it
with
animal
instinct
,
with
a
selfishness
he
had
never
shown
in
health
.
  
<EOS>
Then
the
two
men
consulted
together
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
decided
,
without
a
word
being
spoken
on
the
subject
,
that
both
should
spend
the
night
with
the
forlorn
couple
;
that
was
settled
.
 
<EOS>
But
could
no
doctor
be
had
?
 
<EOS>
In
all
probability
,
no
;
the
next
day
an
Infirmary
order
must
be
begged
,
but
meanwhile
the
only
medical
advice
they
could
have
must
be
from
a
druggist
's
.
 
<EOS>
So
Barton
<EOS>
(
being
the
moneyed
man
)
set
out
to
find
a
shop
in
London
Road
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
pretty
sight
to
walk
through
a
street
with
lighted
shops
;
the
gas
is
so
brilliant
,
the
display
of
goods
so
much
more
vividly
shown
than
by
day
,
and
of
all
shops
a
druggist
's
looks
the
most
like
the
tales
of
our
childhood
,
from
Aladdin
's
garden
of
enchanted
fruits
to
the
charming
Rosamond
with
her
purple
jar
.
 
<EOS>
No
such
associations
had
Barton
;
yet
he
felt
the
contrast
between
the
well
-
filled
,
well
-
lighted
shops
and
the
dim
gloomy
cellar
,
and
it
made
him
moody
that
such
contrasts
should
exist
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
the
mysterious
problem
of
life
to
more
than
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
wondered
if
any
in
all
the
hurrying
crowd
had
come
from
such
a
house
of
mourning
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
they
all
looked
joyous
,
and
he
was
angry
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
<EOS>
,
you
can
not
,
read
the
lot
of
those
who
daily
pass
you
by
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
know
the
wild
romances
of
their
lives
;
the
trials
,
the
temptations
they
are
even
now
enduring
,
resisting
,
sinking
under
?
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
elbowed
one
instant
by
the
girl
desperate
in
her
abandonment
,
laughing
in
mad
merriment
with
her
outward
gesture
,
while
her
soul
is
longing
for
the
rest
of
the
dead
,
and
bringing
itself
to
think
of
the
cold
flowing
river
as
the
only
mercy
of
God
remaining
to
her
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
pass
the
criminal
,
meditating
crimes
at
which
you
will
to
-
morrow
shudder
with
horror
as
you
read
them
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
push
against
one
,
humble
and
unnoticed
,
the
last
upon
earth
,
who
in
heaven
will
for
ever
be
in
the
immediate
light
of
God
's
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
Errands
of
mercy
 
errands
of
sin
 
<EOS>
did
you
ever
think
where
all
the
thousands
of
people
you
daily
meet
are
bound
?
<EOS>
Barton
's
was
an
errand
of
mercy
;
but
the
thoughts
of
his
heart
were
touched
by
sin
,
by
bitter
hatred
of
the
happy
,
whom
he
,
for
the
time
,
confounded
with
the
selfish
.
  
<EOS>
He
reached
a
druggist
's
shop
,
and
entered
.
 
<EOS>
The
druggist
(
whose
smooth
manners
seemed
to
have
been
salved
over
with
his
own
spermaceti
)
listened
attentively
to
Barton
's
description
of
Davenport
's
illness
;
concluded
it
was
typhus
fever
,
very
prevalent
in
that
neighbourhood
;
and
proceeded
to
make
up
a
bottle
of
medicine
,
sweet
spirits
of
nitre
,
or
some
such
innocent
potion
,
very
good
for
slight
colds
,
but
utterly
powerless
to
stop
,
for
an
instant
,
the
raging
fever
of
the
poor
man
it
was
intended
to
relieve
.
 
<EOS>
He
recommended
the
same
course
they
had
previously
determined
to
adopt
,
applying
the
next
morning
for
an
Infirmary
order
;
and
Barton
left
the
shop
with
comfortable
faith
in
the
physic
given
him
;
for
men
of
his
class
,
if
they
believe
in
physic
at
all
,
believe
that
every
description
is
equally
efficacious
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Wilson
had
done
what
he
could
at
Davenport
's
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
soothed
,
and
covered
the
man
many
a
time
;
he
had
fed
and
hushed
the
little
child
,
and
spoken
tenderly
to
the
woman
,
who
lay
still
in
her
weakness
and
her
weariness
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
opened
a
door
,
but
only
for
an
instant
;
it
led
into
a
back
cellar
,
with
a
grating
instead
of
a
window
,
down
which
dropped
the
moisture
from
pigsties
,
and
worse
abominations
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
paved
;
the
floor
was
one
mass
of
bad
smelling
mud
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
never
been
used
,
for
there
was
not
an
article
of
furniture
in
it
;
nor
could
a
human
being
,
much
less
a
pig
,
have
lived
there
many
days
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
the
"
back
apartment
"
made
a
difference
in
the
rent
.
 
<EOS>
The
Davenports
paid
threepence
more
for
having
two
rooms
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
turned
round
again
,
he
saw
the
woman
suckling
the
child
from
her
dry
,
withered
breast
.
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
the
lad
is
weaned
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
he
,
in
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
old
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Going
on
two
year
,
"
she
faintly
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
oh
!
<EOS>
it
keeps
him
quiet
when
I
've
nought
else
to
gi
'
him
,
and
he
'll
get
a
bit
of
sleep
lying
there
,
if
he
's
getten
nought
beside
.
 
<EOS>
We
han
done
our
best
to
gi
'
the
childer
*
food
,
howe'er
we
pinch
ourselves
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
Han
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
ye
had
no
money
fra
'
th
'
town
?
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
No
;
my
master
is
Buckinghamshire
born
;
and
he
's
feared
the
town
would
send
him
back
to
his
parish
,
if
he
went
to
th
'
board
;
so
we
've
just
borne
on
in
hope
o
'
better
times
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
think
they
'll
never
come
in
my
day
,
"
and
the
poor
woman
began
her
weak
high
-
pitched
cry
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
sup
*
<EOS>
this
drop
o
'
gruel
,
and
then
try
and
get
a
bit
o
'
sleep
.
<EOS>
John
and
I
will
watch
by
your
master
to
-
night
.
"
     
<EOS>
"
God
's
blessing
be
on
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
finished
the
gruel
,
and
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Wilson
covered
her
with
his
coat
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
tried
to
move
lightly
,
for
fear
of
disturbing
her
;
but
there
need
have
been
no
such
dread
,
for
her
sleep
was
profound
and
heavy
with
exhaustion
.
 
<EOS>
Once
only
she
roused
to
pull
the
coat
<EOS>
round
her
little
child
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
Wilson
's
care
,
and
<EOS>
Barton
's
to
boot
,
was
wanted
to
restrain
the
wild
mad
agony
of
the
fevered
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
started
up
,
he
yelled
,
he
seemed
infuriated
by
overwhelming
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
He
cursed
and
swore
,
which
surprised
Wilson
,
who
knew
his
piety
in
health
,
and
who
did
not
know
the
unbridled
tongue
of
delirium
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
seemed
exhausted
,
and
fell
asleep
;
and
Barton
and
Wilson
drew
near
the
fire
,
and
talked
together
in
whispers
.
 
<EOS>
They
sat
on
the
floor
,
for
chairs
there
were
none
;
the
sole
table
was
an
old
tub
turned
upside
down
.
 
<EOS>
They
put
out
the
candle
and
conversed
by
the
flickering
firelight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Han
yo
known
this
chap
long
?
"
asked
Barton
.
  
<EOS>
"
Better
nor
three
year
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
worked
wi
'
Carsons
that
long
,
and
were
always
a
steady
,
civil
-
spoken
fellow
,
though
,
as
I
said
afore
,
somewhat
of
a
Methodee
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
'd
getten
a
letter
he
'd
sent
his
missis
,
a
week
or
two
agone
,
when
he
were
on
tramp
for
work
.
 
<EOS>
It
did
my
heart
good
to
read
it
;
for
,
yo
see
,
I
were
a
bit
grumbling
mysel
;
it
seemed
hard
to
be
sponging
on
Jem
,
and
taking
a
'
his
flesh
-
meat
money
to
buy
bread
for
me
and
them
as
I
ought
to
be
keeping
.
 
<EOS>
But
yo
know
,
though
I
can
earn
nought
,
I
mun
eat
summut
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
as
I
telled
ye
,
I
were
grumbling
,
when
she
"
(
indicating
the
sleeping
woman
by
a
nod
)
"
brought
me
Ben
's
letter
,
for
she
could
na
'
read
hersel
.
 
<EOS>
It
were
as
good
as
Bible
-
words
;
ne'er
a
word
<EOS>
o
'
repining
;
<EOS>
a
'
about
God
being
our
Father
,
and
that
we
mun
bear
patiently
<EOS>
whate'er
<EOS>
He
sends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Don
ye
think
He
's
th
'
masters
'
Father
,
too
?
 
<EOS>
I
'd
be
loth
to
have
'em
for
brothers
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Eh
,
John
!
<EOS>
donna
talk
<EOS>
so
;
sure
there
's
many
and
many
a
master
as
good
or
better
nor
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
think
so
,
tell
me
this
.
 
<EOS>
How
comes
it
they
're
rich
,
and
we
're
poor
?
 
<EOS>
I
'd
like
to
know
that
.
 
<EOS>
Han
they
done
as
they
'd
be
done
by
for
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
But
Wilson
was
no
arguer
;
no
speechifier
,
as
he
would
have
called
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
Barton
,
seeing
he
was
likely
to
have
it
his
own
way
,
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
say
(
at
least
many
a
one
does
)
,
<EOS>
they'n
*
getten
capital
<EOS>
an
'
we'n
getten
none
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
our
labour
's
our
capital
,
and
we
ought
to
draw
interest
on
that
.
 
<EOS>
They
get
interest
on
their
capital
<EOS>
somehow
a
'
this
time
,
while
ourn
is
lying
idle
,
else
how
could
they
all
live
as
they
do
?
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
there
's
<EOS>
many
on
'em
has
had
nought
to
begin
wi
'
;
there
's
Carsons
,
and
Duncombes
,
and
Mengies
,
and
many
another
,
as
comed
into
Manchester
with
clothes
to
their
back
,
and
that
were
all
,
and
now
they
're
worth
their
tens
of
thousands
<EOS>
,
a
'
getten
out
of
our
labour
;
why
,
the
very
land
as
fetched
but
sixty
pound
twenty
year
<EOS>
agone
is
now
worth
six
hundred
,
and
that
,
too
,
is
owing
to
our
labour
;
but
look
at
yo
,
and
see
me
,
and
poor
Davenport
yonder
;
whatten
better
are
we
?
 
<EOS>
They'n
screwed
us
down
to
the
lowest
peg
,
in
order
to
make
their
great
big
fortunes
,
and
build
their
great
big
houses
,
and
we
,
why
we
're
just
clemming
,
many
and
many
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
say
there
's
nought
wrong
in
this
?
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Barton
,
I
'll
not
gainsay
ye
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Carson
spoke
to
me
after
th
'
fire
,
and
says
he
,
"
I
shall
ha
'
to
retrench
,
and
be
very
careful
in
my
expenditure
during
these
bad
times
,
I
assure
ye
'
;
<EOS>
so
yo
see
th
'
masters
suffer
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Han
they
ever
seen
a
child
o
'
their'n
die
for
want
o
'
food
?
"
asked
Barton
,
in
a
low
deep
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
donnot
mean
,
"
continued
he
,
"
to
say
as
I
'm
so
badly
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
scorn
to
speak
for
mysel
;
but
when
I
see
such
men
as
Davenport
there
dying
away
,
for
very
clemming
,
I
can
not
stand
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
but
gotten
Mary
,
and
she
keeps
herself
pretty
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
we
'll
ha
'
to
give
up
housekeeping
;
but
that
I
donnot
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
in
this
kind
of
talk
the
night
,
the
long
heavy
night
of
watching
,
wore
away
.
 
<EOS>
As
far
as
they
could
judge
,
Davenport
continued
in
the
same
state
,
although
the
symptoms
varied
occasionally
.
 
<EOS>
The
wife
slept
on
,
only
roused
by
the
cry
of
her
child
now
and
then
,
which
seemed
to
have
power
over
her
,
when
far
louder
noises
failed
to
disturb
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
watchers
agreed
,
that
as
soon
as
it
was
likely
Mr.
Carson
would
be
up
and
visible
,
Wilson
should
go
to
his
house
,
and
beg
for
an
Infirmary
order
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
the
grey
dawn
penetrated
even
into
the
dark
cellar
.
 
<EOS>
Davenport
slept
,
and
Barton
was
to
remain
there
until
Wilson
's
return
;
so
,
stepping
out
into
the
fresh
air
,
brisk
and
reviving
,
even
in
that
street
of
abominations
<EOS>
,
Wilson
took
his
way
to
Mr.
Carson
's
.
  
<EOS>
Wilson
had
about
two
miles
to
walk
before
he
reached
Mr.
Carson
's
house
,
which
was
almost
in
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
The
streets
were
not
yet
bustling
and
busy
.
 
<EOS>
The
shopmen
were
lazily
taking
down
the
shutters
,
although
it
was
near
eight
o'clock
;
for
the
day
was
long
enough
for
the
purchases
people
made
in
that
quarter
of
the
town
,
while
trade
was
so
flat
.
 
<EOS>
One
or
two
miserable
-
looking
women
were
setting
off
on
their
day
's
begging
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
were
few
people
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
's
was
a
good
house
,
and
furnished
with
disregard
to
expense
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
addition
to
lavish
expenditure
,
there
was
much
taste
shown
,
and
many
articles
chosen
for
their
beauty
and
elegance
adorned
his
rooms
.
 
<EOS>
As
Wilson
passed
a
window
which
a
housemaid
had
thrown
open
,
he
saw
pictures
and
gilding
,
at
which
he
was
tempted
to
stop
and
look
;
but
then
he
thought
it
would
not
be
respectful
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
hastened
on
to
the
kitchen
door
.
 
<EOS>
The
servants
seemed
very
busy
with
preparations
for
breakfast
;
but
good
-
naturedly
,
though
hastily
,
told
him
to
step
in
,
and
they
could
soon
let
Mr.
Carson
know
he
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
was
ushered
into
a
kitchen
hung
round
with
glittering
tins
,
where
a
roaring
fire
burnt
merrily
,
and
where
numbers
of
utensils
hung
round
,
at
whose
nature
and
use
Wilson
amused
himself
by
guessing
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
servants
bustled
to
and
fro
;
an
outdoor
manservant
came
in
for
orders
,
and
sat
down
near
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
The
cook
broiled
steaks
,
and
the
kitchen
-
maid
toasted
bread
,
and
boiled
eggs
.
  
<EOS>
The
coffee
steamed
upon
the
fire
,
and
altogether
the
odours
were
so
mixed
and
appetising
,
that
Wilson
began
to
yearn
for
food
to
break
his
fast
,
which
had
lasted
since
dinner
the
day
before
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
servants
had
known
this
,
they
would
have
willingly
given
him
meat
and
bread
in
abundance
;
but
they
were
like
the
rest
of
us
,
and
not
feeling
hunger
themselves
,
forgot
it
was
possible
<EOS>
another
might
.
 
<EOS>
So
Wilson
's
craving
turned
to
sickness
,
while
they
chatted
on
,
making
the
kitchen
's
free
and
keen
remarks
upon
the
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
late
you
were
last
night
,
Thomas
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
was
right
weary
of
waiting
;
they
told
me
to
be
at
the
rooms
by
twelve
;
and
there
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
two
o'clock
before
they
called
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
you
wait
all
that
time
in
the
street
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
housemaid
,
who
had
done
her
work
for
the
present
,
and
come
into
the
kitchen
for
a
bit
of
gossip
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
eye
as
like
!
<EOS>
you
do
n't
think
I
'm
such
a
fool
as
to
catch
my
death
of
cold
,
and
let
the
horses
catch
their
death
too
,
as
we
should
ha
'
done
if
we
'd
stopped
there
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
I
put
th
'
horses
up
in
th
'
stables
at
th
'
Spread
Eagle
,
and
went
mysel
,
and
got
a
glass
or
two
by
th
'
fire
.
 
<EOS>
They
're
driving
a
good
custom
,
them
,
wi
'
coachmen
.
<EOS>
There
were
five
on
us
,
and
we
'd
many
a
quart
o
'
ale
,
and
gin
wi
'
it
,
to
keep
out
th
'
cold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mercy
on
us
,
Thomas
;
you
'll
get
a
drunkard
at
last
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
do
,
I
know
whose
blame
it
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
missis
's
,
and
not
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Flesh
and
blood
ca
n't
sit
to
be
starved
to
death
on
a
coach
-
box
,
waiting
for
folks
as
do
n't
know
their
own
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
servant
,
semi
-
upper
-
housemaid
,
semi
-
lady's
-
maid
,
now
came
down
with
orders
from
her
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thomas
,
you
must
ride
to
the
fishmongers
,
and
say
missis
ca
n't
give
above
half
-
a
-
crown
a
pound
for
salmon
for
Tuesday
;
she
's
grumbling
because
trade
's
so
bad
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
'll
want
the
carriage
at
three
to
go
to
the
lecture
,
Thomas
;
at
the
Royal
Execution
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
'd
better
<EOS>
all
of
you
mind
your
P
's
and
Q
's
,
for
she
's
very
black
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
got
a
bad
headache
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
pity
Miss
Jenkins
is
not
here
to
match
her
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
how
she
and
missis
did
quarrel
which
had
got
the
worst
headaches
;
it
was
that
Miss
Jenkins
left
for
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
not
give
up
having
bad
headaches
,
and
missis
could
not
abide
anyone
to
have
'em
but
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Missis
will
have
her
breakfast
upstairs
,
cook
,
and
the
cold
partridge
as
was
left
yesterday
,
and
put
plenty
of
cream
in
her
coffee
,
and
she
thinks
there
's
a
roll
left
,
and
she
would
like
it
well
buttered
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
saying
,
the
maid
left
the
kitchen
to
be
ready
to
attend
to
the
young
ladies
'
bell
when
they
chose
to
ring
,
after
their
late
assembly
the
night
before
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
luxurious
library
,
at
the
well
-
spread
breakfast
-
table
,
sat
the
two
Mr.
Carsons
,
father
and
son
.
 
<EOS>
Both
were
reading
 
the
father
a
newspaper
,
the
son
a
review
 
while
they
lazily
enjoyed
their
nicely
prepared
food
.
 
<EOS>
The
father
was
a
prepossessing
-
looking
old
man
;
perhaps
self
-
indulgent
you
might
guess
.
 
<EOS>
The
son
was
strikingly
handsome
,
and
knew
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
dress
was
neat
and
well
appointed
,
and
his
manners
far
more
gentlemanly
than
his
father
's
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
only
son
,
and
his
sisters
were
proud
of
him
;
his
father
and
mother
were
proud
of
him
:
he
could
not
set
up
his
judgment
against
theirs
;
he
was
proud
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
The
door
opened
and
in
bounded
Amy
,
the
sweet
youngest
daughter
of
the
house
,
a
lovely
girl
of
sixteen
,
fresh
and
glowing
,
and
bright
as
a
rosebud
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
too
young
to
go
to
assemblies
,
at
which
her
father
rejoiced
,
for
he
had
little
Amy
with
her
pretty
jokes
,
and
her
bird
-
like
songs
,
and
her
playful
caresses
all
the
evening
to
amuse
him
in
his
loneliness
;
and
she
was
not
too
much
tired
like
Sophy
and
Helen
,
to
give
him
her
sweet
company
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
He
submitted
willingly
while
she
blinded
him
with
her
hands
,
and
kissed
his
rough
red
face
all
over
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
his
newspaper
away
after
a
little
pretended
resistance
,
and
would
not
allow
her
brother
Harry
to
go
on
with
his
review
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
the
only
lady
this
morning
,
papa

so
you
know
you
must
make
a
great
deal
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
darling

I
think
you
have
your
own
way
always
,
whether
you
're
the
only
lady
or
not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
papa
,
you
're
pretty
good
and
obedient

I
must
say
that
;
but
I
'm
sorry
to
say
Harry
is
very
naughty
,
and
does
not
do
what
I
tell
him
;
do
you
,
Harry
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
to
accuse
me
of
,
<EOS>
Amy
;
I
expected
praise
and
not
blame
;
for
did
not
I
get
you
that
eau
de
Portugal
from
town
,
that
you
could
not
meet
with
at
Hughes
'
,
you
little
ungrateful
puss

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
sweet
Harry
;
you
're
as
sweet
as
eau
de
Portugal
yourself
;
you
're
almost
as
good
as
papa
;
but
still
you
know
you
did
go
and
forget
to
ask
Bigland
for
that
rose
,
<EOS>
that
new
rose
<EOS>
they
say
he
has
got
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Amy
,
I
did
not
forget
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
him
,
and
he
has
got
the
Rose
<EOS>
,
sans
reproche
:
<EOS>
but
do
you
know
,
little
Miss
Extravagance
,
a
very
small
one
is
half
-
a
-
guinea
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Papa
will
give
it
me
,
wo
n't
you
,
dear
father
?
<EOS>
He
knows
his
little
daughter
can
not
live
without
flowers
and
scents
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
tried
to
refuse
his
darling
,
but
she
coaxed
him
into
acquiescence
,
saying
she
must
have
it
,
it
was
one
of
her
necessaries
.
 
<EOS>
Life
was
not
worth
having
without
flowers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Amy
,
"
said
her
brother
,
"
try
and
be
content
with
peonies
and
dandelions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
wretch
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
call
them
flowers
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
you
're
every
bit
as
extravagant
.
 
<EOS>
Who
gave
half
-
a
-
crown
for
a
bunch
of
lilies
of
the
valley
at
Yates
'
,
a
month
ago
,
and
then
would
not
let
his
poor
little
sister
have
them
,
though
she
went
on
her
knees
to
beg
them
?
<EOS>
Answer
me
that
,
Master
Hal
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
on
compulsion
,
"
replied
her
brother
,
smiling
with
his
mouth
,
while
his
eyes
had
an
irritated
expression
,
and
he
went
first
red
,
then
pale
,
with
vexed
embarrassment
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
sir
,
"
said
a
servant
,
entering
the
room
,
"
<EOS>
here
's
one
of
the
mill
people
wanting
to
see
you
;
his
name
is
Wilson
,
he
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
'll
come
to
him
directly
;
stay
,
tell
him
to
come
in
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
Amy
danced
off
into
the
conservatory
which
opened
out
of
the
room
,
before
the
gaunt
,
pale
,
unwashed
,
unshaven
weaver
was
ushered
in
.
<EOS>
There
he
stood
at
the
door
sleeking
his
hair
with
old
country
habit
,
and
every
now
and
then
stealing
a
glance
round
at
the
splendour
of
the
apartment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Wilson
,
and
what
do
you
want
to
-
day
,
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Please
,
sir
,
Davenport
's
ill
of
the
fever
,
and
I
'm
come
to
know
if
you
've
got
an
Infirmary
order
for
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Davenport
 
Davenport
;
who
is
the
fellow
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
the
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
worked
in
your
factory
better
nor
three
years
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
;
I
do
n't
pretend
to
know
the
names
of
the
men
I
employ
;
that
I
leave
to
the
overlooker
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
's
ill
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
sir
,
he
's
very
bad
;
we
want
to
get
him
in
at
the
Fever
Wards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
if
I
've
an
in
-
patient
's
order
to
spare
at
present
;
but
I
'll
give
you
an
out
-
patient
's
and
welcome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
rose
up
,
unlocked
a
drawer
,
pondered
a
minute
,
and
then
gave
Wilson
an
out
-
patient
's
order
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
younger
Mr.
Carson
had
ended
his
review
,
and
began
to
listen
to
what
was
going
on
.
 
<EOS>
He
finished
his
breakfast
,
got
up
,
and
pulled
five
shillings
out
of
his
pocket
,
which
he
gave
to
Wilson
as
he
passed
him
,
for
the
"
poor
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
went
past
quickly
,
and
calling
for
his
horse
,
mounted
gaily
,
and
rode
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
anxious
to
be
in
time
to
have
a
look
and
a
smile
from
lovely
 
Mary
Barton
,
as
she
went
to
Miss
Simmonds
'
.
 
<EOS>
But
to
-
day
he
was
to
be
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
Wilson
left
the
house
,
not
knowing
whether
to
be
pleased
or
grieved
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
all
spoken
kindly
to
him
,
and
who
could
tell
if
they
might
not
inquire
into
Davenport
's
case
,
and
do
something
for
him
and
his
family
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
cook
,
who
,
when
she
had
had
time
to
think
,
after
breakfast
was
sent
in
,
had
noticed
his
paleness
,
had
had
meat
and
bread
ready
to
put
in
his
hand
when
he
came
out
of
the
parlour
;
and
a
full
stomach
makes
every
one
of
us
more
hopeful
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
reached
Berry
Street
,
he
had
persuaded
himself
he
bore
good
news
,
and
felt
almost
elated
in
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
fell
when
he
opened
the
cellar
-
door
,
and
saw
Barton
and
the
wife
both
bending
over
the
sick
man
's
couch
with
awestruck
,
saddened
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
here
,
"
said
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
change
comed
over
him
sin
'
yo
left
,
is
there
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
Wilson
looked
.
 
<EOS>
The
flesh
was
sunk
,
the
features
prominent
,
bony
,
and
rigid
.
 
<EOS>
The
fearful
clay
-
colour
of
death
was
over
all
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
eyes
were
open
and
sensitive
,
though
the
films
of
the
grave
were
setting
upon
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
wakened
fra
'
his
sleep
,
as
yo
left
him
in
,
and
began
to
mutter
and
moan
;
but
he
soon
went
off
again
,
and
we
never
knew
he
were
awake
till
he
called
his
wife
,
but
now
she
's
here
<EOS>
he
's
gotten
nought
to
say
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Most
probably
,
as
they
all
felt
,
he
could
not
speak
,
for
his
strength
<EOS>
was
fast
ebbing
.
 
<EOS>
They
stood
round
him
still
and
silent
;
even
the
wife
checked
her
sobs
,
though
her
heart
was
like
to
break
.
<EOS>
She
held
her
child
to
her
breast
,
to
try
and
keep
him
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
Their
eyes
were
all
fixed
on
the
yet
living
one
,
whose
moments
of
life
were
passing
so
rapidly
away
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
brought
(
with
jerking
convulsive
effort
)
<EOS>
his
two
hands
into
the
attitude
of
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
They
saw
his
lips
move
,
and
bent
to
catch
the
words
,
which
came
in
gasps
,
and
not
in
tones
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
Lord
God
!
 
<EOS>
I
thank
thee
,
that
the
hard
struggle
of
living
is
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
O
Ben
!
Ben
!
"
wailed
forth
his
wife
,
"
have
you
no
thought
for
me
?
 
<EOS>
O
Ben
!
 
<EOS>
Ben
!
<EOS>
do
say
one
word
to
help
me
through
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
speak
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
trump
of
the
archangel
would
set
his
tongue
free
;
but
not
a
word
more
would
it
utter
till
then
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
he
heard
,
he
understood
,
and
though
sight
failed
,
he
moved
his
hand
gropingly
over
the
covering
.
 
<EOS>
They
knew
what
he
meant
,
and
guided
it
to
her
head
,
bowed
and
hidden
in
her
hands
,
when
she
had
sunk
in
her
woe
.
 
<EOS>
It
rested
there
with
a
feeble
pressure
of
endearment
.
 
<EOS>
The
face
grew
beautiful
,
as
the
soul
neared
God
.
 
<EOS>
A
peace
beyond
understanding
came
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
hand
was
a
heavy
stiff
weight
on
the
wife
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
No
more
grief
or
sorrow
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
reverently
laid
out
the
corpse
 
<EOS>
Wilson
fetching
his
only
spare
shirt
to
array
it
in
.
 
<EOS>
The
wife
still
lay
hidden
in
the
clothes
,
in
a
stupor
of
agony
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
knock
at
the
door
,
and
Barton
went
to
open
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Mary
,
who
had
received
a
message
from
her
father
,
through
a
neighbour
,
telling
her
where
he
was
;
and
she
had
set
out
early
to
come
and
have
a
word
with
him
before
her
day
's
work
;
but
some
errands
she
had
to
do
for
Miss
Simmonds
had
detained
her
until
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
wench
!
"
said
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
Try
if
thou
canst
comfort
yon
poor
,
poor
woman
,
kneeling
down
there
.
 
<EOS>
God
help
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
did
not
know
what
to
say
,
or
how
to
comfort
;
but
she
knelt
down
by
her
,
and
put
her
arm
round
her
neck
,
and
in
a
little
while
fell
to
crying
herself
so
bitterly
that
the
source
of
tears
was
opened
by
sympathy
in
the
widow
,
and
her
full
heart
was
,
for
a
time
,
relieved
.
  
<EOS>
And
Mary
forgot
<EOS>
all
purposed
meeting
with
her
gay
lover
,
Harry
Carson
;
forgot
Miss
Simmonds
'
errands
,
and
her
anger
,
in
the
anxious
desire
to
comfort
the
poor
lone
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Never
had
her
sweet
face
looked
more
angelic
,
never
had
her
gentle
voice
seemed
so
musical
as
when
she
murmured
her
broken
sentences
of
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
cry
so
,
dear
Mrs.
Davenport
,
pray
do
n't
take
on
so
.
 
<EOS>
Sure
he
's
gone
<EOS>
where
he
'll
never
know
care
again
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
know
how
lonesome
you
must
feel
;
but
think
of
your
children
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
we
'll
all
help
to
earn
food
for
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Think
how
sorry
HE'D
be
,
if
he
sees
you
fretting
so
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
cry
so
,
please
do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
she
ended
by
crying
herself
as
passionately
as
the
poor
widow
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
agreed
the
town
must
bury
him
;
he
had
paid
to
a
burial
club
as
long
as
he
could
,
but
by
a
few
weeks
'
omission
,
he
had
forfeited
his
claim
to
a
sum
of
money
now
.
 
<EOS>
Would
Mrs.
Davenport
and
the
little
child
go
home
with
Mary
?
 
<EOS>
The
latter
brightened
up
as
she
urged
this
plan
;
but
no
!
<EOS>
where
the
poor
,
fondly
loved
remains
were
,
there
would
the
mourner
be
;
and
all
that
they
could
do
was
to
make
her
as
comfortable
as
their
funds
would
allow
,
and
to
beg
a
neighbour
to
look
in
and
say
a
word
at
times
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
was
left
alone
with
her
dead
,
and
they
went
to
work
that
had
work
,
and
he
who
had
none
,
took
upon
him
the
arrangements
for
the
funeral
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
had
many
a
scolding
from
Miss
Simmonds
that
day
for
her
absence
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
Miss
Simmonds
was
much
put
out
by
Mary
's
non
-
appearance
in
the
morning
with
certain
bits
of
muslin
,
and
shades
of
silk
which
were
wanted
to
complete
a
dress
to
be
worn
that
night
;
but
it
was
true
enough
that
Mary
did
not
mind
what
she
was
about
;
she
was
too
busy
planning
how
her
old
black
gown
(
her
best
when
her
mother
died
)
might
be
sponged
,
and
turned
,
and
lengthened
into
something
like
decent
mourning
for
the
widow
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
she
went
home
at
night
(
though
it
was
very
late
,
as
a
sort
of
retribution
for
her
morning
's
negligence
)
,
she
set
to
work
at
once
,
and
was
so
busy
and
so
glad
over
her
task
,
that
she
had
,
every
now
and
then
,
to
check
herself
in
singing
merry
ditties
,
which
she
felt
little
accorded
with
the
sewing
on
which
she
was
engaged
.
  
<EOS>
So
when
the
funeral
day
came
,
Mrs.
Davenport
was
neatly
arrayed
in
black
,
a
satisfaction
to
her
poor
heart
in
the
midst
of
her
sorrow
.
<EOS>
Barton
and
Wilson
both
accompanied
her
,
as
she
led
her
two
elder
boys
,
and
followed
the
coffin
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
simple
walking
funeral
,
with
nothing
to
grate
on
the
feelings
of
any
;
far
more
in
accordance
with
its
purpose
,
to
my
mind
,
than
the
gorgeous
hearses
,
and
nodding
plumes
,
which
form
the
grotesque
funeral
pomp
of
respectable
people
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
"
rattling
the
bones
over
the
stones
,
"
of
the
pauper
's
funeral
.
 
<EOS>
Decently
and
quietly
was
he
followed
to
the
grave
by
one
determined
to
endure
her
woe
meekly
for
his
sake
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
mark
of
pauperism
attendant
on
the
burial
concerned
the
living
and
joyous
,
far
more
than
the
dead
,
or
the
sorrowful
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
arrived
in
the
churchyard
,
they
halted
before
a
raised
and
handsome
tombstone
;
in
reality
a
wooden
mockery
of
stone
respectabilities
which
adorned
the
burial
-
ground
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
easily
raised
in
a
very
few
minutes
,
and
below
was
the
grave
in
which
pauper
bodies
were
piled
until
within
a
foot
or
two
of
the
surface
;
when
the
soil
was
shovelled
over
,
and
stamped
down
,
and
the
wooden
cover
went
to
do
temporary
duty
over
another
hole
.
<EOS>
*
 
<EOS>
But
little
recked
they
of
this
who
now
gave
up
their
dead
.
      
<EOS>
JEM
WILSON
'S
REPULSE

"
How
infinite
the
wealth
of
love
and
hope
Garnered

tiny

houses
<EOS>
And
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
what
bankrupts
in
the

we
feel

When
Death

like

Seizes

"
THE
TWINS
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
ghoul
-
like
fever
was
not
to
be
braved
with
impunity
,
and
balked
of
its
prey
.
 
<EOS>
The
widow
had
reclaimed
her
children
;
her
neighbours
,
in
the
good
-
Samaritan
sense
of
the
word
,
had
paid
her
little
arrears
of
rent
,
and
made
her
a
few
shillings
beforehand
with
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
determined
to
flit
from
that
cellar
to
another
less
full
of
painful
associations
,
less
haunted
by
mournful
memories
.
 
<EOS>
The
Board
,
not
so
formidable
as
she
had
imagined
,
had
inquired
into
her
case
;
and
,
instead
of
sending
her
to
Stoke
Claypole
,
her
husband
's
Buckinghamshire
parish
,
as
she
had
dreaded
,
had
agreed
to
pay
her
rent
.
 
<EOS>
So
food
for
four
mouths
was
all
she
was
now
required
to
find
;
only
for
three
she
would
have
said
;
for
herself
and
the
unweaned
child
were
but
reckoned
as
one
in
her
calculation
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
a
strong
heart
,
now
her
bodily
strength
had
been
recruited
by
a
week
or
two
of
food
,
and
she
would
not
despair
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
took
in
some
little
children
to
nurse
,
who
brought
their
daily
food
with
them
,
which
she
cooked
for
them
,
without
wronging
their
helplessness
of
a
crumb
;
and
when
she
had
restored
them
to
their
mothers
at
night
,
she
set
to
work
at
plain
sewing
,
"
seam
,
and
gusset
,
and
band
,
"
and
sat
thinking
how
she
might
best
cheat
the
factory
inspector
,
and
persuade
him
that
her
strong
,
big
,
hungry
Ben
was
above
thirteen
.
 
<EOS>
Her
plan
of
living
was
so
far
arranged
,
when
she
heard
,
with
keen
sorrow
,
that
Wilson
's
twin
lads
were
ill
of
the
fever
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
never
been
strong
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
like
many
a
pair
of
twins
,
and
seemed
to
have
but
one
life
divided
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
One
life
,
one
strength
,
and
in
this
instance
,
I
might
almost
say
,
one
brain
,
for
they
were
helpless
,
gentle
,
silly
children
,
but
not
the
less
dear
to
their
parents
and
to
their
strong
,
active
,
manly
,
elder
brother
.
<EOS>
They
were
late
on
their
feet
,
late
in
talking
,
late
every
way
;
had
to
be
nursed
and
cared
for
when
other
lads
of
their
age
were
tumbling
about
in
the
street
,
and
losing
themselves
,
and
being
taken
to
the
police
-
office
miles
away
from
home
.
  
<EOS>
Still
want
had
never
yet
come
in
at
the
door
to
make
love
for
these
innocents
fly
out
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
the
case
even
now
,
when
Jem
Wilson
's
earnings
,
and
his
mother
's
occasional
charings
,
were
barely
sufficient
to
give
all
the
family
their
fill
of
food
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
the
twins
,
after
ailing
many
days
,
and
caring
little
for
their
meat
,
fell
sick
on
the
same
afternoon
,
with
the
same
heavy
stupor
of
suffering
,
the
three
hearts
that
loved
them
so
,
each
felt
,
though
none
acknowledged
to
the
other
,
that
they
had
little
chance
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
nearly
a
week
before
the
tale
of
their
illness
spread
as
far
as
the
court
where
the
Wilsons
had
once
dwelt
,
and
the
Bartons
yet
lived
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
had
heard
of
the
sickness
of
her
little
nephews
several
days
before
,
and
had
locked
her
cellar
door
,
and
gone
off
straight
to
her
brother
's
house
,
in
Ancoats
;
but
she
was
often
absent
for
days
,
sent
for
,
as
her
neighbours
knew
,
to
help
in
some
sudden
emergency
of
illness
or
distress
,
so
that
occasioned
no
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
Margaret
met
Jem
Wilson
several
days
after
his
brothers
were
seriously
ill
,
and
heard
from
him
the
state
of
things
at
his
home
.
<EOS>
She
told
Mary
of
it
as
she
entered
the
court
late
that
evening
;
and
Mary
listened
with
saddened
heart
to
the
strange
contrast
which
such
woeful
tidings
presented
to
the
gay
and
loving
words
she
had
been
hearing
on
her
walk
home
.
 
<EOS>
She
blamed
herself
for
being
so
much
taken
up
with
visions
of
the
golden
future
that
she
had
lately
gone
but
seldom
on
Sunday
afternoons
,
or
other
leisure
time
,
to
see
Mrs.
Wilson
,
her
mother
's
friend
;
and
with
hasty
purpose
of
amendment
she
only
stayed
to
leave
a
message
for
her
father
with
the
next
-
door
neighbour
,
and
then
went
off
at
a
brisk
pace
on
her
way
to
the
house
of
mourning
.
  
<EOS>
She
stopped
with
her
hand
on
the
latch
of
the
Wilsons
'
door
,
to
still
her
beating
heart
,
and
listened
to
the
hushed
quiet
within
.
<EOS>
She
opened
the
door
softly
;
there
sat
Mrs.
Wilson
in
the
old
rocking
-
chair
,
with
one
sick
death
-
like
boy
lying
on
her
knee
,
crying
without
let
or
pause
,
but
softly
,
gently
,
as
fearing
to
disturb
the
troubled
,
gasping
child
;
while
behind
her
,
old
Alice
let
her
fast
-
dropping
tears
fall
down
on
the
dead
body
of
the
other
twin
,
which
she
was
laying
out
on
a
board
placed
on
a
sort
of
sofa
-
settee
in
a
corner
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Over
the
child
,
which
yet
breathed
,
the
father
bent
,
watching
anxiously
for
some
ground
of
hope
,
where
hope
there
was
none
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
stepped
slowly
and
lightly
across
to
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
poor
lad
!
 
<EOS>
God
has
taken
him
early
,
Mary
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
could
not
speak
,
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
;
it
was
so
much
worse
than
she
had
expected
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
she
ventured
to
whisper
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
chance
for
the
other
one
,
think
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
shook
her
head
,
and
told
with
a
look
that
she
believed
there
was
none
.
 
<EOS>
She
next
endeavoured
to
lift
the
little
body
,
and
carry
it
to
its
old
accustomed
bed
in
its
parents
'
room
.
 
<EOS>
But
earnest
as
the
father
was
in
watching
the
yet
-
living
,
he
had
eyes
and
ears
for
all
that
concerned
the
dead
,
and
sprang
gently
up
,
and
took
his
dead
son
on
his
hard
couch
in
his
arms
with
tender
strength
,
and
carried
him
upstairs
as
if
afraid
of
wakening
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
other
child
gasped
louder
,
longer
,
with
more
of
effort
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
mun
get
him
away
from
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
not
die
while
she
's
wishing
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wishing
him
?
"
said
Mary
,
in
a
tone
of
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
;
donno
'
ye
know
what
"
wishing
"
means
?
 
<EOS>
There
's
none
can
die
in
the
arms
of
those
who
are
wishing
them
sore
to
stay
on
earth
.
 
<EOS>
The
soul
o
'
<EOS>
them
as
holds
them
wo
n't
let
the
dying
soul
go
free
;
so
it
has
a
hard
struggle
for
the
quiet
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
We
mun
get
him
away
<EOS>
fra
'
his
mother
,
or
he
'll
have
a
hard
death
,
poor
lile

<EOS>
So
without
circumlocution
she
went
and
offered
to
take
the
sinking
child
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
mother
would
not
let
him
go
,
and
looking
in
Alice
's
face
with
brimming
and
imploring
eyes
,
declared
,
in
earnest
whispers
,
that
she
was
not
wishing
him
,
that
she
would
fain
have
him
released
from
his
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
and
Mary
stood
by
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
poor
child
,
whose
struggles
seemed
to
increase
,
till
at
last
his
mother
said
,
with
a
choking
voice
   
<EOS>
"
May
happen
*
<EOS>
yo'd
better
take
him
,
Alice
<EOS>
;
I
believe
my
heart
's
wishing
him
a

this
while
,
for
I
can
not
,
no
,
I
can
not
bring
mysel
to
let
my
two
childer
go
in
one
day
;
I
can
not
help
longing
to
keep
him
,
and
yet
he
sha
n't
suffer
longer
for
me
.
"
     
<EOS>
She
bent
down
,
and
fondly
,
oh
!
with
what
passionate
fondness
,
kissed
her
child
,
and
then
gave
him
up
to
Alice
,
who
took
him
with
tender
care
.
 
<EOS>
Nature
's
struggles
were
soon
exhausted
,
and
he
breathed
his
little
life
away
in
peace
.
  
<EOS>
Then
the
mother
lifted
up
her
voice
and
wept
.
 
<EOS>
Her
cries
brought
her
husband
down
to
try
with
his
aching
heart
to
comfort
hers
.
 
<EOS>
Again
Alice
laid
out
the
dead
,
Mary
helping
with
reverent
fear
.
 
<EOS>
The
father
and
mother
carried
him
upstairs
to
the
bed
,
where
his
little
brother
lay
in
calm
repose
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
and
Alice
drew
near
the
fire
,
and
stood
in
quiet
sorrow
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Alice
broke
the
silence
by
saying
   
"
It
will
be
bad
news
for
Jem
,
poor
fellow
,
when
he
comes
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
"
asked
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Working
over
-
hours
at
th
'
shop
.
 
<EOS>
They'n
getten
a
large
order
fra
'
forrin
parts
;
and
yo
know
,
<EOS>
Jem
mun
work
,
though
his
heart
's
well
-
nigh
breaking
for
these
poor
laddies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Again
they
were
silent
in
thought
,
and
again
Alice
spoke
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
sometimes
think
the
Lord
is
against
planning
.
 
<EOS>
Whene'er
<EOS>
I
plan
overmuch
,
He
is
sure
to
send
and
mar
all
my
plans
,
as
if
He
would
ha
'
me
put
the
future
into
His
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Afore
Christmas
time
I
was
as
full
as
full
could
be
,
of
going
home
for
good
and
all
;
yo
han
heard
how
I
've
wished
it
this
terrible
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
And
a
young
lass
from
behind
Burton
came
into
place
in
Manchester
last
Martinmas
;
so
after
awhile
she
had
a
Sunday
out
,
and
she
comes
to
me
,
and
tells
me
some
cousins
o
'
mine
bid
her
find
me
out
,
and
say
how
glad
they
should
be
to
ha
'
me
to
bide
wi
'
'em
,
and
look
after
th
'
childer
,
for
they'n
getten
a
big
farm
,
and
she
's
a
deal
to
do
among
th
'
cows
.
 
<EOS>
So
many
's
a
winter
's
night
<EOS>
did
I
lie
awake
and
think
,
that
please
God
,
come
summer
,
I
'd
bid
George
and
his
wife
goodbye
,
and
go
home
at
last
.
<EOS>
Little
did
I
think
how
God
Almighty
would
balk
me
,
for
not
leaving
my
days
in
His
hands
,
who
had
led
me
through
the
wilderness
hitherto
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
George
out
of
work
,
and
more
cast
down
than
ever
I
seed
him
;
wanting
every
chip
o
'
comfort
he
can
get
,
e'en
<EOS>
afore
this
last
heavy
stroke
;
and
now
I
'm
thinking
the
Lord
's
finger
points
very
clear
to
my
fit
abiding
-
place
;
and
I
'm
sure
if
George
and
Jane
can
say
"
His
will
be
done
,
"
it
's
no
more
than
what
I
'm
beholden
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
fell
to
tidying
the
room
,
removing
as
much
as
she
could
every
vestige
of
sickness
;
making
up
the
fire
,
and
setting
on
the
kettle
for
a
cup
of
tea
for
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
whose
low
moans
and
sobs
were
occasionally
heard
in
the
room
below
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
helped
her
in
all
these
little
offices
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
busy
in
this
way
when
the
door
was
softly
opened
,
and
Jem
came
in
,
all
grimed
and
dirty
from
his
night
-
work
,
his
soiled
apron
wrapped
round
his
middle
,
in
guise
and
apparel
in
which
he
would
have
been
sorry
at
another
time
to
have
been
seen
by
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
But
just
now
he
hardly
saw
her
;
he
went
straight
up
to
Alice
,
and
asked
how
the
little
chaps
were
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
been
a
shade
better
at
dinner
-
time
;
and
he
had
been
working
away
through
the
long
afternoon
,
and
far
into
the
night
,
in
the
belief
that
they
had
taken
the
turn
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
stolen
out
during
the
half
-
hour
allowed
at
the
works
for
tea
,
to
buy
them
an
orange
or
two
,
which
now
puffed
out
his
jacket
-
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
make
his
aunt
speak
<EOS>
:
he
would
not
understand
her
shake
of
the
head
and
fast
coursing
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
both
gone
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dead
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
poor
fellows
.
 
<EOS>
They
took
worse
about
two
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
went
first
,
as
easy
as
a
lamb
,
and
Will
died
harder
like
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Both
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
lad
!
<EOS>
both
.
 
<EOS>
The
Lord
has
ta'en
them
from
some
evil
to
come
,
or
He
would
na
'
ha
'
made
choice
o
'
them
.
 
<EOS>
Ye
may
rest
sure
o
'
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
went
to
the
cupboard
,
and
quietly
extricated
from
his
pocket
the
oranges
he
had
bought
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
stayed
long
there
,
and
at
last
his
sturdy
frame
shook
with
his
strong
agony
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
women
were
frightened
,
as
women
always
are
,
on
witnessing
a
man
's
overpowering
grief
.
 
<EOS>
They
cried
afresh
in
company
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
's
heart
melted
within
her
as
she
witnessed
Jem
's
sorrow
,
and
she
stepped
gently
up
to
the
corner
where
he
stood
,
with
his
back
turned
to
them
,
and
putting
her
hand
softly
on
his
arm
,
said
   
"
<EOS>
O
Jem
,
do
n't
give
way
so
;
I
can
not
bear
to
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
felt
a
strange
leap
of
joy
in
his
heart
,
and
knew
the
power
she
had
of
comforting
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
speak
,
as
though
fearing
to
destroy
by
sound
or
motion
the
happiness
of
that
moment
,
when
her
soft
hand
's
touch
thrilled
through
his
frame
,
and
her
silvery
voice
was
whispering
tenderness
in
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
it
might
be
very
wrong
;
he
could
almost
hate
himself
for
it
;
with
death
and
woe
so
surrounding
him
,
it
yet
was
happiness
,
was
bliss
,
to
be
so
spoken
to
by
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
,
Jem
,
please
do
n't
,
"
whispered
she
again
,
believing
that
his
silence
was
only
another
form
of
grief
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
contain
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
her
hand
in
his
firm
yet
trembling
grasp
,
and
said
,
in
tones
that
instantly
produced
a
revulsion
in
her
mood
   
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
I
almost
loathe
myself
when
I
feel
I
would
not
give
up
this
minute
,
when
my
brothers
lie
dead
,
and
father
and
mother
are
in
such
trouble
,
for
all
my
life
that
's
past
and
gone
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
Mary
,
"
(
as
she
tried
to
release
her
hand
)
<EOS>
,
"
you
know
what
makes
me
feel
so
blessed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
did
know
 
<EOS>
he
was
right
there
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
he
turned
to
catch
a
look
at
her
sweet
face
,
he
saw
that
it
expressed
unfeigned
distress
,
almost
amounting
to
vexation
;
<EOS>
a
dread
of
him
,
that
he
thought
was
almost
repugnance
.
  
<EOS>
He
let
her
hand
go
,
and
she
quickly
went
away
to
Alice
's
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fool
that
I
was
 
nay
,
wretch
that
I
was
 
to
let
myself
take
this
time
of
trouble
to
tell
her
how
I
loved
her
;
no
wonder
that
she
turns
away
from
such
a
selfish
beast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Partly
to
relieve
her
from
his
presence
,
and
partly
from
natural
desire
,
and
partly
,
perhaps
,
from
a
penitent
wish
to
share
to
the
utmost
<EOS>
his
parents
'
sorrow
,
he
soon
went
upstairs
to
the
chamber
of
death
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
mechanically
helped
Alice
in
all
the
duties
she
performed
through
the
remainder
of
that
long
night
,
but
she
did
not
see
Jem
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
remained
upstairs
until
after
the
early
dawn
showed
Mary
that
she
need
have
no
fear
of
going
home
through
the
deserted
and
quiet
streets
,
to
try
and
get
a
little
sleep
before
work
-
hour
.
 
<EOS>
So
leaving
kind
messages
to
George
and
Jane
Wilson
,
and
hesitating
whether
she
might
dare
to
send
a
few
kind
words
to
Jem
,
and
deciding
that
she
had
better
not
,
she
stepped
out
into
the
bright
morning
light
,
so
fresh
a
contrast
to
the
darkened
room
where
death
had
been
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
had
 
<EOS>
Another
morn
than
ours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
lay
down
on
her
bed
in
her
clothes
;
and
whether
it
was
this
,
or
the
broad
day
-
light
that
poured
in
through
the
sky
window
,
or
whether
it
was
over
-
excitement
,
it
was
long
before
she
could
catch
a
wink
of
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Her
thoughts
ran
on
Jem
's
manner
and
words
;
not
but
what
she
had
known
the
tale
they
told
for
many
a
day
;
but
still
she
wished
he
had
not
put
it
so
plainly
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
dear
,
"
said
she
to
herself
,
"
I
wish
he
would
not
mistake
me
so
;
I
never
dare
to
speak
a
common
word
o
'
kindness
,
but
his
eye
brightens
and
his
cheek
flushes
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
very
hard
on
me
;
for
father
and
George
Wilson
are
old
friends
;
and
Jem
and
I
ha
'
known
each
other
since
we
were
quite
children
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
what
possesses
me
,
that
I
must
always
be
wanting
to
comfort
him
when
he
's
downcast
,
and
that
I
must
go
meddling
wi
'
him
to
-
night
,
when
sure
enough
it
was
his
aunt
's
place
to
speak
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
for
him
,
and
yet
,
unless
I
'm
always
watching
myself
,
I
'm
speaking
to
him
in
a
loving
voice
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
not
go
right
,
for
I
either
check
myself
till
I
'm
downright
cross
to
him
,
or
else
I
speak
just
natural
,
and
that
's
too
kind
and
tender
by
half
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
'm
as
good
as
engaged
to
be
married
to
another
;
and
another
far
handsomer
than
Jem
;
only
I
think
I
like
Jem
's
face
best
for
all
that
;
liking
's
liking
,
and
there
's
no
help
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
when
I
'm
Mrs.
Harry
Carson
,
may
happen
I
can
put
some
good
fortune
in
Jem
's
way
.
 
<EOS>
But
will
he
thank
me
for
it
?
 
<EOS>
He
's
rather
savage
at
times
,
that
I
can
see
,
and
perhaps
kindness
from
me
,
when
I
'm
another
's
,
will
only
go
against
the
grain
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
not
plague
myself
wi
'
thinking
any
more
about
him
,
that
I
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
she
turned
on
her
pillow
,
and
fell
asleep
,
and
dreamt
of
what
was
often
in
her
waking
thoughts
;
of
the
day
when
she
should
ride
from
church
in
her
carriage
,
with
wedding
-
bells
ringing
,
and
take
up
her
astonished
father
,
and
drive
away
from
the
old
dim
work
-
a
-
day
court
for
ever
,
to
live
in
a
grand
house
,
where
her
father
should
have
newspapers
,
and
pamphlets
,
and
pipes
,
and
meat
dinners
every
day
 
and
all
day
long
if
he
liked
.
  
<EOS>
Such
thoughts
mingled
in
her
predilection
for
the
handsome
young
Mr.
Carson
,
who
,
unfettered
by
work
-
hours
,
let
scarcely
a
day
pass
without
contriving
a
meeting
with
the
beautiful
little
milliner
he
had
first
seen
while
lounging
in
a
shop
where
his
sisters
were
making
some
purchases
,
and
afterwards
never
rested
till
he
had
freely
,
though
respectfully
,
made
her
acquaintance
in
her
daily
walks
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
,
to
use
his
own
expression
to
himself
,
quite
infatuated
by
her
,
and
was
restless
each
day
till
the
time
came
when
he
had
a
chance
,
and
,
of
late
,
more
than
a
chance
of
meeting
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
of
keen
practical
shrewdness
about
her
,
which
contrasted
very
bewitchingly
with
the
simple
,
foolish
,
unworldly
ideas
she
had
picked
up
from
the
romances
which
Miss
Simmonds
'
young
ladies
were
in
the
habit
of
recommending
to
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
Mary
was
ambitious
,
and
did
not
favour
Mr.
Carson
the
less
because
he
was
rich
and
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
leaven
,
infused
years
ago
by
her
Aunt
Esther
,
fermented
in
her
little
bosom
,
and
perhaps
all
the
more
,
for
her
father
's
aversion
to
the
rich
and
the
gentle
.
<EOS>
Such
is
the
contrariness
of
the
human
heart
,
from
Eve
downwards
,
that
we
all
,
in
our
old
Adam
state
,
fancy
things
forbidden
sweetest
.
<EOS>
So
Mary
dwelt
upon
and
enjoyed
the
idea
of
some
day
becoming
a
lady
,
and
doing
all
the
elegant
nothings
appertaining
to
ladyhood
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
comfort
to
her
,
when
scolded
by
Miss
Simmonds
,
to
think
of
the
day
when
she
would
drive
up
to
the
door
in
her
own
carriage
,
to
order
her
gowns
from
the
hasty
-
tempered
yet
kind
dressmaker
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
pleasure
to
her
to
hear
the
general
admiration
of
the
two
elder
Miss
Carsons
,
acknowledged
beauties
in
ball
-
room
and
street
,
on
horseback
and
on
foot
,
and
to
think
of
the
time
when
she
should
ride
and
walk
with
them
in
loving
sisterhood
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
best
of
her
plans
,
the
holiest
,
that
which
in
some
measure
redeemed
the
vanity
of
the
rest
,
were
those
relating
to
her
father
;
her
dear
father
,
now
oppressed
with
care
,
and
always
a
disheartened
,
gloomy
person
.
 
<EOS>
How
she
would
surround
him
with
every
comfort
she
could
devise
<EOS>
(
of
course
,
he
was
to
live
with
them
)
,
till
he
should
acknowledge
riches
to
be
very
pleasant
things
,
and
bless
his
lady
-
daughter
!
 
<EOS>
Every
one
who
had
shown
her
kindness
in
her
low
estate
should
then
be
repaid
a
hundredfold
.
  
<EOS>
Such
were
the
castles
in
air
,
the
Alnaschar
-
visions
in
which
Mary
indulged
,
and
which
she
was
doomed
in
after
days
to
expiate
with
many
tears
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
her
words
 
or
,
even
more
,
her
tones
 
would
maintain
their
hold
on
Jem
Wilson
's
memory
.
 
<EOS>
A
thrill
would
yet
come
over
him
when
he
remembered
how
her
hand
had
rested
on
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
The
thought
of
her
mingled
with
all
his
grief
,
and
it
was
profound
,
for
the
loss
of
his
brothers
.

LOVE
THOUGHTS
.
  
<EOS>
One
Sunday
afternoon
,
about
three
weeks
after
that
mournful
night
,
Jem
Wilson
set
out
with
the
ostensible
purpose
of
calling
on
John
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
his
best
 
his
Sunday
suit
of
course
;
while
his
face
glittered
with
the
scrubbing
he
had
bestowed
on
it
.
<EOS>
His
dark
black
hair
had
been
arranged
and
rearranged
before
the
household
looking
-
glass
,
and
in
his
button
-
hole
he
stuck
a
narcissus
(
a
sweet
Nancy
is
its
pretty
Lancashire
name
)
,
hoping
it
would
attract
Mary
's
notice
,
so
that
he
might
have
the
delight
of
giving
it
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
bad
beginning
of
his
visit
of
happiness
that
Mary
saw
him
some
minutes
before
he
came
into
her
father
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
sitting
at
the
end
of
the
dresser
,
with
the
little
window
-
blind
drawn
on
one
side
,
in
order
that
she
might
see
the
passers
-
by
,
in
the
intervals
of
reading
her
Bible
,
which
lay
open
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
watched
all
the
greeting
a
friend
gave
Jem
;
she
saw
the
face
of
condolence
,
the
sympathetic
shake
of
the
hand
,
and
had
time
to
arrange
her
own
face
and
manner
before
Jem
came
in
,
which
he
did
,
as
if
he
had
eyes
for
no
one
but
her
father
,
who
sat
smoking
his
pipe
by
the
fire
,
while
he
read
an
old
Northern
Star
,
borrowed
from
a
neighbouring
public
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
Then
he
turned
to
Mary
,
who
,
he
felt
through
the
sure
instinct
of
love
,
by
which
almost
his
body
thought
,
was
present
.
 
<EOS>
Her
hands
were
busy
adjusting
her
dress
;
a
forced
and
unnecessary
movement
Jem
could
not
help
thinking
.
 
<EOS>
Her
accost
was
quiet
and
friendly
,
if
grave
;
she
felt
that
she
reddened
like
a
rose
,
and
wished
she
could
prevent
it
,
while
Jem
wondered
if
her
blushes
arose
from
fear
,
or
anger
,
or
love
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
very
cunning
<EOS>
,
I
am
afraid
.
 
<EOS>
She
pretended
to
read
diligently
,
and
not
to
listen
to
a
word
that
was
said
,
while
in
fact
she
heard
all
sounds
,
even
to
Jem
's
long
,
deep
sighs
,
which
wrung
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
she
took
up
her
Bible
,
and
as
if
their
conversation
disturbed
her
,
went
upstairs
to
her
little
room
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
had
scarcely
spoken
a
word
to
Jem
<EOS>
;
scarcely
looked
at
him
;
never
noticed
his
beautiful
sweet
Nancy
,
which
only
awaited
her
least
word
of
praise
to
be
hers
!
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
 
that
pang
was
spared
 
that
in
her
little
dingy
bedroom
stood
a
white
jug
,
filled
with
a
luxuriant
bunch
of
early
spring
roses
,
making
the
whole
room
fragrant
and
bright
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
the
gift
of
her
richer
lover
.
 
<EOS>
So
Jem
had
to
go
on
sitting
with
John
Barton
,
fairly
caught
in
his
own
trap
,
and
had
to
listen
to
his
talk
,
and
answer
him
as
best
he
might
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
right
stuff
in
this
here
Star
,
and
no
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
right
-
down
piece
for
short
hours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
the
same
rate
of
wages
as
now
?
"
asked
Jem
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
!
<EOS>
else
where
's
the
use
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
only
taking
out
o
'
the
masters
'
pocket
what
they
can
well
afford
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
ever
tell
yo
<EOS>
what
th
'
Infirmary
chap
let
me
into
,
many
a
year
agone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Jem
listlessly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
yo
must
know
I
were
in
th
'
Infirmary
for
a
fever
,
and
times
were
rare
and
bad
,
and
there
be
good
chaps
there
to
a
man
while
he
's
wick
,
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
whate'er
they
may
be
about
cutting
him
up
at
after
.
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
 
<EOS>
So
when
I
were
better
o
'
th
'
fever
,
but
weak
as
water
,
they
says
to
me
,
says
they
,
"
If
yo
can
write
,
you
may
stay
in
a
week
longer
,
and
help
our
surgeon
wi
'
sorting
his
papers
;
and
we
'll
take
care
<EOS>
yo've
your
bellyful
of
meat
and
drink
.
 
<EOS>
Yo'll
be
twice
as
strong
in
a
week
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
there
wanted
but
<EOS>
one
word
to
that
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
were
set
to
writing
and
copying
;
th
'
writing
I
could
do
well
enough
,
but
they
'd
<EOS>
such
queer
ways
<EOS>
o
'
spelling
,
that
I
'd
ne'er
been
used
to
,
that
I
'd
to
look
first
at
th
'
copy
and
then
at
my
letters
,
for
all
the
world
like
a
cock
picking
up
grains
o
'
corn
.
 
<EOS>
But
one
thing
startled
me
e'en
then
,
and
I
thought
I
'd
make
bold
to
ask
the
surgeon
<EOS>
the
meaning
o't
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
getten
no
head
for
numbers
,
but
this
I
know
,
that
by

when

and

<EOS>
Th
'
surgeon
said
it
were
all
true
,
and
that
he
were
going
to
bring
that
fact
to
light
.

CHAUCER
,
The
Squire
's
Tale
.
  
<EOS>
Jem
was
pondering
Mary
's
conduct
;
but
the
pause
made
him
aware
he
ought
to
utter
some
civil
listening
noise
;
so
he
said
   
"
Very
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
it
's
true
enough
,
my
lad
,
that
we
're
sadly
over
-
borne
,
and
worse
will
come
of
it
<EOS>
afore
long
.
 
<EOS>
Block

they'n
getten
a
bang

up

,
as
wo
n't
let
'em
be
put
upon
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
many
a
thing
will
happen
afore
long
,
as
folk
do
n't
expect
.
 
<EOS>
Yo
may
take
my
word
for
that
,
Jem
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
was
very
willing
to
take
it
,
but
did
not
express
the
curiosity
he
should
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
So
John
Barton
thought
he
'd
try
another
hint
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
Working
folk
wo
n't
be
ground
to
the
dust
much
longer
.
 
<EOS>
We'n
a
'
had
as
much
to
bear
as
human
nature
can
bear
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
if
th
'
masters
ca
n't
do
us
no
good
,
and
they
say
they
ca
n't
,
we
mun
try
higher
folk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Still
Jem
was
not
curious
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
up
hope
of
seeing
Mary
again
by
her
own
good
free
-
will
;
and
the
next
best
thing
would
be
,
to
be
alone
to
think
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
muttering
something
which
he
meant
to
serve
as
an
excuse
for
his
sudden
departure
,
he
hastily
wished
John
good
-
afternoon
,
and
left
him
to
resume
his
pipe
and
his
politics
.
  
<EOS>
For
three
years
past
trade
had
been
getting
worse
and
worse
,
and
the
price
of
provisions
higher
and
higher
.
 
<EOS>
This
disparity
between
the
amount
of
the
earnings
of
the
working
classes
and
the
price
of
their
food
,
occasioned
,
in
more
cases
than
could
well
be
imagined
,
disease
and
death
.
 
<EOS>
Whole
families
went
through
a
gradual
starvation
.
 
<EOS>
They
only
wanted
a
Dante
to
record
their
sufferings
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
even
his
words
would
fall
short
of
the
awful
truth
;
they
could
only
present
an
outline
of
the
tremendous
facts
of
the
destitution
that
surrounded
thousands
upon
thousands
in
the
terrible
years
1839
,
1840
,
and
1841
.
 
<EOS>
Even
philanthropists
who
had
studied
the
subject
,
were
forced
to
own
themselves
perplexed
in
their
endeavour
to
ascertain
the
real
causes
of
the
misery
;
the
whole
matter
was
of
so
complicated
a
nature
,
that
it
became
next
to
impossible
to
understand
it
thoroughly
.
 
<EOS>
It
need
excite
no
surprise
,
then
,
to
learn
that
a
bad
feeling
between
working
-
men
and
the
upper
classes
became
very
strong
in
this
season
of
privation
.
 
<EOS>
The
indigence
and
sufferings
of
the
operatives
induced
a
suspicion
in
the
minds
of
many
of
them
,
that
their
legislators
,
their
magistrates
,
their
employers
,
and
even
the
ministers
of
religion
,
were
,
in
general
,
their
oppressors
and
enemies
;
and
were
in
league
for
their
prostration
and
enthralment
.
 
<EOS>
The
most
deplorable
and
enduring
evil
that
arose
out
of
the
period
of
commercial
depression
to
which
I
refer
,
was
this
feeling
of
alienation
between
the
different
classes
of
society
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
so
impossible
to
describe
,
or
even
faintly
to
picture
,
the
state
of
distress
which
prevailed
in
the
town
at
that
time
,
that
I
will
not
attempt
it
;
and
yet
I
think
again
that
surely
,
in
a
Christian
land
,
it
was
not
known
even
so
feebly
as
words
could
tell
it
,
or
the
more
happy
and
fortunate
would
have
thronged
with
their
sympathy
and
their
aid
.
 
<EOS>
In
many
instances
the
sufferers
wept
first
,
and
then
they
cursed
.
 
<EOS>
Their
vindictive
feelings
exhibited
themselves
in
rabid
politics
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
hear
,
as
I
have
heard
,
of
the
sufferings
and
privations
of
the
poor
,
of
provision
shops
where
ha'porths
of
tea
,
sugar
,
butter
,
and
even
flour
,
were
sold
to
accommodate
the
indigent
 
of
parents
sitting
in
their
clothes
by
the
fireside
during
the
whole
night
,
for
seven
weeks
together
,
in
order
that
their
only
bed
and
bedding
might
be
reserved
for
the
use
of
their
large
family
 
of
others
sleeping
upon
the
cold
hearthstone
for
weeks
in
succession
,
without
adequate
means
of
providing
themselves
with
food
or
fuel
(
and
this
in
the
depth
of
winter
)
 
of
others
being
compelled
to
fast
for
days
together
,
uncheered
by
any
hope
of
better
fortune
,
living
,
moreover
,
or
rather
starving
,
in
a
crowded
garret
,
or
damp
cellar
,
and
gradually
sinking
under
the
pressure
of
want
and
despair
into
a
premature
grave
;
and
when
this
has
been
confirmed
by
the
evidence
of
their
careworn
looks
,
their
excited
feelings
,
and
their
desolate
homes
 
<EOS>
can
I
wonder
that
many
of
them
,
in
such
times
of
misery
and
destitution
,
spoke
and
acted
with
ferocious
precipitation
?
  
<EOS>
An
idea
was
now
springing
up
among
the
operatives
,
that
originated
with
the
Chartists
,
but
which
came
at
last
to
be
cherished
as
a
darling
child
by
many
and
many
a
one
.
 
<EOS>
They
could
not
believe
that
Government
knew
of
their
misery
;
they
rather
chose
to
think
it
possible
that
men
could
voluntarily
assume
the
office
of
legislators
for
a
nation
who
were
ignorant
of
its
real
state
;
as
who
should
make
domestic
rules
for
the
pretty
behaviour
of
children
without
caring
to
know
that
those
children
had
been
kept
for
days
without
food
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
starving
multitudes
had
heard
,
that
the
very
existence
of
their
distress
had
been
denied
in
Parliament
;
and
though
they
felt
this
strange
and
inexplicable
,
yet
the
idea
that
their
misery
had
still
to
be
revealed
in
all
its
depths
,
and
that
then
some
remedy
would
be
found
,
soothed
their
aching
hearts
,
and
kept
down
their
rising
fury
.
  
<EOS>
So
a
petition
was
framed
,
and
signed
by
thousands
in
the
bright
spring
days
of
1839
,
imploring
Parliament
to
hear
witnesses
who
could
testify
to
the
unparalleled
destitution
of
the
manufacturing
districts
.
 
<EOS>
Nottingham
,
Sheffield
,
Glasgow
,
Manchester
,
and
many
other
towns
,
were
busy
appointing
delegates
to
convey
this
petition
,
who
might
speak
,
not
merely
of
what
they
had
seen
,
and
had
heard
,
but
from
what
they
had
borne
and
suffered
.
 
<EOS>
Life
-
worn
,
gaunt
,
anxious
,
hunger
-
stamped
men
,
were
those
delegates
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
them
was
John
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
been
ashamed
to
own
the
flutter
of
spirits
his
appointment
gave
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
childish
delight
of
seeing
London
 
that
went
a
little
way
,
and
but
a
little
way
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
vain
idea
of
speaking
out
his
notions
before
so
many
grand
folk
 
<EOS>
that
went
a
little
further
;
and
last
,
there
was
the
really
pure
gladness
of
heart
arising
from
the
idea
that
he
was
one
of
those
chosen
to
be
instruments
in
making
known
the
distresses
of
the
people
,
and
consequently
in
procuring
them
some
grand
relief
,
by
means
of
which
they
should
never
suffer
want
or
care
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
hoped
largely
,
but
vaguely
,
of
the
results
of
his
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
An
argosy
of
the
precious
hopes
of
many
otherwise
despairing
creatures
,
was
that
petition
to
be
heard
concerning
their
sufferings
.
  
<EOS>
The
night
before
the
morning
on
which
the
Manchester
delegates
were
to
leave
for
London
,
Barton
might
be
said
to
hold
a
levee
,
so
many
neighbours
came
dropping
in
.
 
<EOS>
Job
Legh
had
early
established
himself
and
his
pipe
by
John
Barton
's
fire
,
not
saying
much
,
but
puffing
away
,
and
imagining
himself
of
use
in
adjusting
the
smoothing
-
irons
that
hung
before
the
fire
,
ready
for
Mary
when
she
should
want
them
.
<EOS>
As
for
Mary
,
her
employment
was
the
same
as
that
of
Beau
Tibbs
'
wife
,
"
just
washing
her
father
's
two
shirts
,
"
in
the
pantry
back
-
kitchen
;
for
she
was
anxious
about
his
appearance
in
London
.
<EOS>
(
The
coat
had
been
redeemed
,
though
the
silk
handkerchief
was
forfeited
.
)
 
<EOS>
The
door
stood
open
,
as
usual
,
between
the
house
-
place
and
back
-
kitchen
,
so
she
gave
her
greeting
to
their
friends
as
they
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
,
John
,
yo're
bound
for
London

are
yo
?
"
said
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
I
suppose
I
mun
go
,
"
answered
John
,
yielding
to
necessity
as
it
were
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
there
's
many
a
thing
I
'd
like
yo
to
speak
on
to
the
Parliament
people
.
 
<EOS>
Thou'lt
not
spare
'em
,
John
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
'em
our
minds
:
how
we
're
thinking
we'n
been
clemmed
long
enough
,
and
we
donnot
see
whatten
good
they'n
been
doing

if
they
ca

give
us
what
we
're
all
crying
for
sin
'
<EOS>
the
day
we
were
born
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
!
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
'em
that
,
and
much
more
to
it
,
when
it
gets
to
my
turn
;
but
thou
knows
there
's
<EOS>
many
will
have
their
word
afore
me

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well

thou'lt
speak
at

<EOS>
Bless
thee

lad

do
ask
'em
to
make
th

<EOS>
There

never
been

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Machines
is
th
'
ruin
of
poor
folk
,
"
chimed
in
several
voices
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
my
part
,
"
said
a
shivering
,
half
-
clad
man
,
who
crept
near
the
fire
,
as
if
ague
-
stricken
,
"
I
would
like
thee
to
tell
'em
to
pass
th
'
Short

hours
Bill
.
 
<EOS>
Flesh
and
blood
gets
wearied
wi
'
so
much
work
;
why
should
factory
hands
work
so
much
longer
nor
other
trades
?
<EOS>
Just
ask
'em
that
,
Barton
,
will
ye
?
"
  
<EOS>
Barton
was
saved
the
necessity
of
answering
,
by
the
entrance
of
Mrs.
Davenport
,
the
poor
widow
he
had
been
so
kind
to
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
half
-
fed
,
and
eager
,
but
was
decently
clad
.
 
<EOS>
In
her
hand
she
brought
a
little
newspaper
parcel
,
which
she
took
to
Mary
,
who
opened
it
,
and
then
called
out
,
dangling
a
shirt
collar
from
her
soapy
fingers
   
<EOS>
"
See
,
father
,
<EOS>
what
a
dandy
you
'll
be
in
London
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davenport
has
brought
you
this
;
made
new
cut
,
all
after
the
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
for
thinking
on
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
Mary
!
"
said
Mrs.
Davenport
in
a
low
voice
,
"
whatten
's
all
I
can
do
,
to
what
he
's
done
for
me
and
mine
?
 
<EOS>
But
,
Mary
,
sure
I
can
help
ye
,
for
you
'll
be
busy
wi
'
this
journey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
help
me
wring
these
out
,
and
then
I
'll
take
'em
to
the
mangle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
Mrs.
Davenport
became
a
listener
to
the
conversation
;
and
after
a
while
joined
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
,
John
Barton
,
if
yo
are
taking
messages
to
the
Parliament
folk
,
yo'll
not
object
to
telling
'em
<EOS>
what
a
sore
trial
it
is
,
this
law
o
'
theirs
,
keeping
childer
fra
'
factory
work
,
whether
they
be
weakly
or
strong
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
our
Ben
;
why
,
porridge
seems
to
go
no
way
wi
'
him
,
he
eats
so
much
;
and
I
han
gotten
no
money
to
send
him
t
'
school
,
as
I
would
like
;
and
there
he
is
,
rampaging
about
the
streets
a
'
day
,
getting
hungrier
and
hungrier
,
and
picking
up
a
'
manner
o
'
bad
ways
;
and
th
'
inspector
wo
n't
let
him
in
to
work
in
th
'
factory
,
because
he
's
not
right
age

though
he
's
twice
as
strong

<EOS>
of
a

and
better
.
"
     
<EOS>
"
I
've
one
plan
I
wish
to
tell
John
Barton
,
"
said
a
pompous
,
careful
-
speaking
man
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
should
like
him
for
to
lay
it
afore
the
Honourable
House
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
comed
out
o
'
Oxfordshire
,
and
were
under
-
laundry
-
maid
in
Sir
Francis
Dashwood
's
family
;
and
when
we
were
little
ones
,
she
'd
tell
us
stories
of
their
grandeur
:
and
one
thing
she
named
were
,
that
Sir
Francis
wore
two
shirts
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
Now
he
were
all
as
one
as
a
Parliament
man
;
and
many
on
'em
,
I
han
no
doubt
,
are
like
extravagant
.
 
<EOS>
Just
tell
'em
,
John
,
do
,
that
they
'd
be
doing
the
Lancashire
weavers
a
great
kindness
,
if
they
'd
ha
'
their
shirts
a
'
made
o
'
calico
;
'
t
would
make
trade
brisk
,
that
would
,
wi
'
the
power
o
'
shirts
they
wear
.
"
  
<EOS>
Job
Legh
now
put
in
his
word
.
 
<EOS>
Taking
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
,
and
addressing
the
last
speaker
,
he
said
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
ye
<EOS>
what
,
Bill
,
and
no
offence
,
mind
ye
<EOS>
;
there
's
but
<EOS>
hundreds
of
them
Parliament
folk
as
wear
so
many
shirts
to
their
back
;
but
there
's
thousands
and
thousands
<EOS>
o
'
poor
weavers
as
han
only
gotten
one
shirt
<EOS>
i
'
the
world
;
ay
,
and
do
n't
know
where
t
'
get
another
when
that
rag
's
done
,
though
they
're
turning
out
miles
o
'
calico
every
day
;
and
many
a
mile
o't
is
lying
in
warehouses
,
stopping
up
trade
for
want
o
'
purchasers
.
 
<EOS>
Yo
take
my
advice
,
John
Barton
,
and
ask
Parliament
to
set
trade
free
,
so
as
workmen
can
earn
a
decent
wage
,
and
buy
their
two
,
ay
and
three
,
shirts
a
year
;
that
would
make
weaving
brisk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
again
,
and
redoubled
his
puffing
,
to
make
up
for
lost
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afeard
,
neighbours
,
"
said
John
Barton
,
"
I
've
not
much
chance
<EOS>
o
'
telling
<EOS>
'em
all
yo
say
;
what
I
think
on
,
is
just
speaking
out
about
the
distress
that
they
say
is
nought
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
hear
o
'
children
born
on
wet
flags
,
without
a
rag
t
'
cover
'em
or
a
bit
<EOS>
o
'
food
for
th
'
mother
;
when
they
hear
of
folk
lying
down
to
die
i
'
th
'
streets
,
or
hiding
their
want
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
some
hole
o
'
a
cellar
till
death
come
to
set
'em
free
;
and
when
they
hear
o
'
all
this
plague
,
pestilence
,
and
famine
,
they
'll
surely
do
somewhat
wiser
for
us
than
we
can
guess
at
now
.
 
<EOS>
Howe'er
,
I
han
no
objection
,
if
so
be
there
's
an
opening
,
to
speak
up
for
what
yo
say
;
anyhow
,
I
'll
do
my
best
,
and
yo
see
now
,
if
better
times
do
n't
come
after
Parliament
knows
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Some
shook
their
heads
,
but
more
looked
cheery
:
and
then
one
by
one
dropped
off
,
leaving
John
and
his
daughter
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Didst
thou
mark
how
poorly
Jane
Wilson
looked
?
"
<EOS>
asked
he
,
as
they
wound
up
their
hard
day
's
work
by
a
supper
eaten
over
the
fire
,
which
glowed
and
glimmered
through
the
room
,
and
formed
their
only
light
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
ca
n't
say
as
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
's
never
rightly
held
up
her
head
since
the
twins
died
;
and
all
along
<EOS>
she
has
never
been
a
strong
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
sin
'
her
accident
.
 
<EOS>
Afore
that
I
mind
her
looking
as
fresh
and
likely
a
girl
as
e'er
a
one
in
Manchester
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
accident
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
cotched
*
<EOS>
her
side
again
a
wheel
.
 
<EOS>
It
were
afore
wheels
were
boxed
up
.
 
<EOS>
It
were
just
when
she
were
to
have
been
married
,
and
many
a
one
thought
George
would
ha
'
been
off
his
bargain
;
but
I
knew
he
wern't
<EOS>
the
chap
for
that
trick
.
 
<EOS>
Pretty
near
the
first
place
she
went
to
when
she
were
able
to
go
about
again
,
was
th
'
Oud
Church
;
poor
wench
,
all
pale
and
limping
,
she
went
up
the
aisle
,
George
holding
her
up
as
tender
as
a
mother
,
and
walking
as
slow
as
e'er
<EOS>
he
could
,
not
to
hurry
her
,
though
there
were
plenty
enow
of
rude
lads
to
cast
their
jests
at
him
and
her
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
were
white
like
a
sheet
when
she
came
in
church
,
but
afore
she
got
to
th
'
altar
<EOS>
she
were
all
one
flush
.
 
<EOS>
But
for
a
'
that
it
's
been
a
happy
marriage
,
and
George
has
stuck
by
me
through
life
like
a
brother
.
 
<EOS>
He
'll
never
hold
up
his
head
again
if
he
loses
Jane
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
like
her
looks
to
-
night
.
"
     
<EOS>
And
so
he
went
to
bed
,
the
fear
of
forthcoming
sorrow
to
his
friend
mingling
with
his
thoughts
of
to
-
morrow
,
and
his
hopes
for
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
watched
him
set
off
,
with
her
hands
over
her
eyes
to
shade
them
from
the
bright
slanting
rays
of
the
morning
sun
,
and
then
she
turned
into
the
house
to
arrange
its
disorder
before
going
to
her
work
.
 
<EOS>
She
wondered
if
she
should
like
or
dislike
the
evening
and
morning
solitude
;
for
several
hours
when
the
clock
struck
she
thought
of
her
father
,
and
wondered
where
he
was
;
she
made
good
resolutions
according
to
her
lights
;
and
by
-
and
-
bye
came
the
distractions
and
events
of
the
broad
full
day
to
occupy
her
with
the
present
,
and
to
deaden
the
memory
of
the
absent
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
Mary
's
resolutions
was
,
that
she
would
not
be
persuaded
or
induced
to
see
Mr.
Harry
Carson
during
her
father
's
absence
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
something
crooked
in
her
conscience
after
all
;
for
this
very
resolution
seemed
an
acknowledgment
that
it
was
wrong
to
meet
him
at
any
time
;
and
yet
she
had
brought
herself
to
think
her
conduct
quite
innocent
and
proper
,
for
although
unknown
to
her
father
,
and
certain
,
even
did
he
know
it
,
to
fail
of
obtaining
his
sanction
<EOS>
,
she
esteemed
her
love
-
meetings
with
Mr.
Carson
as
sure
to
end
in
her
fathers
good
and
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
that
he
was
away
,
she
would
do
nothing
that
he
would
disapprove
of
;
no
,
not
even
though
it
was
for
his
own
good
in
the
end
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
amongst
Miss
Simmonds
'
young
ladies
was
one
who
had
been
from
the
beginning
a
confidante
in
Mary
's
love
affair
,
made
so
by
Mr.
Carson
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
felt
the
necessity
of
some
third
person
to
carry
letters
and
messages
,
and
to
plead
his
cause
when
he
was
absent
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
girl
named
Sally
Leadbitter
he
had
found
a
willing
advocate
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
have
been
willing
to
have
embarked
in
a
love
affair
herself
(
especially
a
clandestine
one
)
,
for
the
mere
excitement
of
the
thing
;
but
her
willingness
was
strengthened
by
sundry
half
-
sovereigns
,
which
from
time
to
time
Mr.
Carson
bestowed
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
Sally
Leadbitter
was
vulgar
-
minded
to
the
last
degree
;
never
easy
unless
her
talk
was
of
love
and
lovers
;
in
her
eyes
it
was
an
honour
to
have
had
a
long
list
of
wooers
.
 
<EOS>
So
constituted
,
it
was
a
pity
that
Sally
herself
was
but
a
plain
,
red
-
haired
,
freckled
girl
;
never
likely
,
one
would
have
thought
,
to
become
a
heroine
on
her
own
account
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
she
lacked
in
beauty
she
tried
to
make
up
for
by
a
kind
of
witty
boldness
,
which
gave
her
what
her
betters
would
have
called
piquancy
.
 
<EOS>
Considerations
of
modesty
or
propriety
never
checked
her
utterance
of
a
good
thing
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
just
talent
enough
to
corrupt
others
.
 
<EOS>
Her
very
good
nature
was
an
evil
influence
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
hate
one
who
was
so
kind
;
they
could
not
avoid
one
who
was
so
willing
to
shield
them
from
scrapes
by
any
exertion
of
her
own
;
whose
ready
fingers
would
at
any
time
make
up
for
their
deficiencies
,
and
whose
still
more
convenient
tongue
would
at
any
time
invent
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
Jews
,
or
Mohammedans
(
I
forget
which
)
,
believe
that
there
is
one
little
bone
of
our
body
,
 
one
of
the
vertebrae
,
if
I
remember
rightly
,
 
which
will
never
decay
and
turn
to
dust
,
but
will
lie
incorrupt
and
indestructible
in
the
ground
until
the
Last
Day
:
this
is
the
Seed
of
the
Soul
.
 
<EOS>
The
most
depraved
have
also
their
Seed
of
the
Holiness
that
shall
one
day
overcome
their
evil
;
their
one
good
quality
,
lurking
hidden
,
but
safe
,
among
all
the
corrupt
and
bad
.
  
<EOS>
Sally
's
seed
of
the
future
soul
was
her
love
for
her
mother
,
an
aged
bedridden
woman
.
 
<EOS>
For
her
she
had
self
-
denial
;
for
her
,
her
good
-
nature
rose
into
tenderness
;
to
cheer
her
lonely
bed
,
her
spirits
,
in
the
evenings
,
when
her
body
was
often
woefully
tired
,
never
flagged
,
but
were
ready
to
recount
the
events
of
the
day
,
to
turn
them
into
ridicule
,
and
to
mimic
,
with
admirable
fidelity
,
any
person
gifted
with
an
absurdity
who
had
fallen
under
her
keen
eye
.
<EOS>
But
the
mother
was
lightly
principled
like
Sally
herself
;
nor
was
there
need
to
conceal
from
her
the
reason
why
Mr.
Carson
gave
her
so
much
money
.
 
<EOS>
She
chuckled
with
pleasure
,
and
only
hoped
that
the
wooing
would
be
long
a
-
doing
.
  
<EOS>
Still
neither
she
,
nor
her
daughter
,
nor
Harry
Carson
liked
this
resolution
of
Mary
,
not
to
see
him
during
her
father
's
absence
.
  
<EOS>
One
evening
(
and
the
early
summer
evenings
were
long
and
bright
now
)
,
Sally
met
Mr.
Carson
by
appointment
,
to
be
charged
with
a
letter
for
Mary
,
imploring
her
to
see
him
,
which
Sally
was
to
back
with
all
her
powers
of
persuasion
.
 
<EOS>
After
parting
from
him
she
determined
,
as
it
was
not
so
very
late
,
to
go
at
once
to
Mary
's
,
and
deliver
the
message
and
letter
.
  
<EOS>
She
found
Mary
in
great
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
just
heard
of
George
Wilson
's
sudden
death
:
her
old
friend
,
her
father
's
friend
,
Jem
's
father
 
<EOS>
all
his
claims
came
rushing
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
Though
not
guarded
from
unnecessary
sight
or
sound
of
death
,
as
the
children
of
the
rich
are
,
yet
it
had
so
often
been
brought
home
to
her
this
last
three
or
four
months
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
so
terrible
thus
to
see
friend
after
friend
depart
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
,
too
,
who
had
dreaded
Jane
Wilson
's
death
the
evening
before
he
set
off
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
,
the
weakly
,
was
left
behind
,
while
the
strong
man
was
taken
.
 
<EOS>
At
any
rate
the
sorrow
her
father
had
so
feared
for
him
was
spared
.
 
<EOS>
Such
were
the
thoughts
which
came
over
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
go
to
comfort
the
bereaved
,
even
if
comfort
were
in
her
power
to
give
;
for
she
had
resolved
to
avoid
Jem
;
and
she
felt
that
this
of
all
others
was
not
the
occasion
on
which
she
could
keep
up
a
studiously
cold
manner
.
  
<EOS>
And
in
this
shock
of
grief
,
Sally
Leadbitter
was
the
last
person
she
wished
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
she
rose
to
welcome
her
,
betraying
her
tear
-
swollen
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
shall
tell
Mr.
Carson
to
-
morrow
how
you
're
fretting
for
him
;
it
's
no
more
nor
he
's
doing
for
you
,
I
can
tell
you
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
For
him
,
indeed
!
"
said
Mary
,
with
a
toss
of
her
pretty
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
miss
,
for
him
!
 
<EOS>
You
've
been
sighing
as
if
your
heart
would
break
now
for
several
days
,
over
your
work
;
now
arn't
you
a
little
goose
not
to
go
and
see
one
who
I
am
sure
loves
you
as
his
life
,
and
whom
you
love
;
"
How
much
,
Mary
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
much
,
"
as
the
children
say
"
(
opening
her
arms
very
wide
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
"
said
Mary
,
pouting
;
"
I
often
think
I
do
n't
love
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
'm
to
tell
him
that
,
am
I
,
<EOS>
next
time
I
see
him
?
"
asked
Sally
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
like
,
"
replied
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
care
for
that
or
anything
else
now
"
;
weeping
afresh
.
  
<EOS>
But
Sally
did
not
like
to
be
the
bearer
of
any
such
news
.
 
<EOS>
She
saw
she
had
gone
on
the
wrong
tack
,
and
that
Mary
's
heart
was
too
full
to
value
either
message
or
letter
as
she
ought
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
wisely
paused
in
their
delivery
and
said
,
in
a
more
sympathetic
tone
than
she
had
hitherto
used
   
"
<EOS>
Do
tell
me
,
Mary
,
what
's
fretting
you
so
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
I
never
could
abide
to
see
you
cry
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
George
Wilson
's
dropped
down
dead
this
afternoon
,
"
said
Mary
,
fixing
her
eyes
for
one
minute
on
Sally
,
and
the
next
hiding
her
face
in
her
apron
as
she
sobbed
anew
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
!
 
<EOS>
All
flesh
is
grass
;
here
to
-
day
and
gone
tomorrow
,
as
the
Bible
says
.
 
<EOS>
Still
he
was
an
old
man
,
and
not
good
for
much
;
there
's
better
folk
than
him
left
behind
.
 
<EOS>
Is
th
'
canting
old
maid
as
was
his
sister
alive
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
who
you
mean
,
"
said
Mary
sharply
;
for
she
did
know
,
and
did
not
like
to
have
her
dear
,
simple
Alice
so
spoken
of
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Mary
,
do
n't
be
so
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
Is
Miss
Alice
Wilson
alive
,
then
;
will
that
please
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
n't
seen
her
hereabouts
lately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
she
's
left
living
here
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
twins
died
,
she
thought
she
could
,
maybe
,
be
of
use
to
her
sister
,
who
was
sadly
cast
down
,
and
Alice
thought
she
could
cheer
her
up
;
at
any
rate
she
could
listen
to
her
when
her
heart
grew
overburdened
;
so
she
gave
up
her
cellar
and
went
to
live
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
good
go
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
no
fancy
for
her
,
and
<EOS>
I
'd
no
fancy
for
her
making
my
pretty
Mary
into
a
Methodee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
n't
a
Methodee
;
she
was
Church
o
'
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
Mary
,
you
're
very
particular
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
what
I
meant
.
<EOS>
Look
,
who
is
this
letter
from
?
"
<EOS>
holding
up
Henry
Carson
's
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
and
do
n't
care
,
"
said
Mary
,
turning
very
red
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
eye
!
<EOS>
as
if
I
did
n't
know
you
did
know
and
did
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
give
it
me
,
"
said
Mary
impatiently
,
and
anxious
in
her
present
mood
for
her
visitor
's
departure
.
  
<EOS>
Sally
relinquished
it
unwillingly
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
,
however
,
the
pleasure
of
seeing
Mary
dimple
and
blush
as
she
read
the
letter
,
which
seemed
to
say
the
writer
was
not
indifferent
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
tell
him
I
ca
n't
come
,
"
said
Mary
,
raising
her
eyes
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
I
wo
n't
meet
him
while
father
is
away
,
and
I
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Mary
,
he
does
so
look
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
'd
be
quite
sorry
for
him
,
he
's
so
put
out
about
not
seeing
you
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
you
go
when
your
father
's
at
home
,
without
letting
on
*
to
him
,
and
what
harm
would
there
be
in
going
now
?
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sally
,
you
know
my
answer
,
I
wo
n't
;
and
I
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
him
to
come
and
see
you
himself
some
evening
,
instead
o
'
sending
me
;
he
'd
maybe
find
you
not
so
hard
to
deal
with
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
flashed
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
dares
to
come
here
while
father
's
away
,
I
'll
call
the
neighbours
in
to
turn
him
out
,
so
do
n't
be
putting
him
up
to
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mercy
on
us
!
<EOS>
one
would
think
you
were
the
first
girl
that
ever
had
a
lover
;
have
you
never
heard
what
other
girls
do
and
think
no
shame
of
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
Sally
!
<EOS>
that
's
Margaret
Jennings
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
in
an
instant
Margaret
was
in
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
had
begged
Job
Legh
to
let
her
come
and
sleep
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
uncertain
firelight
you
could
not
help
noticing
that
she
had
the
groping
walk
of
a
blind
person
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
must
go
,
Mary
,
"
said
Sally
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
that
's
your
last
word
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
;
good
-
night
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
shut
the
door
gladly
on
her
unwelcome
visitor
 
unwelcome
at
that
time
at
least
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
Margaret
,
have
ye
heard
this
sad
news
about
George
Wilson
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
that
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
creatures
,
they
've
been
so
tried
lately
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
think
sudden
death
so
bad
a
thing
;
it
's
easy
,
and
there
's
no
terrors
for
him
as
dies
.
 
<EOS>
For
them
as
survives
it
's
very
hard
.
<EOS>
Poor
George
!
<EOS>
he
were
such
a
hearty
-
looking
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Margaret
,
"
said
Mary
,
who
had
been
closely
observing
her
friend
,
"
thou'rt
very
blind
to
-
night
,
<EOS>
arn't
thou
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
wi
'
crying
?
 
<EOS>
Your
eyes
are
so
swollen
and
red
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dear
!
<EOS>
but
not
crying
for
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
Han
ye
heard
where
I
was
last
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
where
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
held
up
a
bright
golden
sovereign
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
opened
her
large
grey
eyes
with
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
all
and
<EOS>
how
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
there
's
a
gentleman
lecturing
on
music
at
th
'
Mechanics
'
,
and
he
wants
folk
to
sing
his
songs
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
last
night
the
counter
got
a
sore
throat
and
could
n't
make
a
note
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
sent
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Jacob
Butterworth
had
said
a
good
word
for
me
,
and
they
asked
me
would
I
sing
?
 
<EOS>
You
may
think
I
was
frightened
,
but
I
thought
,
Now
or
never
,
and
said
I
'd
do
my
best
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
tried
o'er
the
songs
wi
'
th
'
lecturer
,
and
then
th
'
managers
told
me
I
were
to
make
myself
decent
and
be
there
by
seven
.
"
  
"
And
what
did
you
put
on
?
"
asked
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
why
did
n't
you
come
in
for
my
pretty
pink
gingham
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
think
on't
;
but
you
had
na
come
home
then
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
I
put
on
my
merino
,
as
was
turned
last
winter
,
and
my
white
shawl
,
and
did
my
hair
pretty
tidy
;
it
did
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
as
I
was
saying
,
I
went
at
seven
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
see
to
read
my
music
,
but
I
took
th
'
paper
in
wi
'
me
,
to
ha
'
something
to
do
wi
'
my
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
Th
'
folks
'
heads
danced
,
as
I
stood
as
right
<EOS>
afore
<EOS>
'em
all
as
if
I
'd
been
going
to
play
at
ball
wi
'
'em
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
guess
I
felt
squeamish
,
but
mine
were
n't
the
first
song
,
and
th
'
music
sounded
like
a
friend
's
voice
telling
me
to
take
courage
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
to
make
a
long
story
short
,
when
it
were
all
o'er
th
'
lecturer
thanked
me
,
and
th
'
managers
said
as
how
there
never
was
a
new
singer
so
applauded
(
for
they
'd
clapped
and
stamped
after
I
'd
done
,
till
I
began
to
wonder
how
many
pair
o
'
shoes
<EOS>
they
'd
get
through
a
week
at
that
rate
,
let
alone
their
hands
)
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
'm
to
sing
again
o
'
Thursday
;
and
I
got
a
sovereign
last
night
,
and
am
to
have
half
-
a
-
sovereign
every
night
th
'
<EOS>
lecturer
is
at
th
'
Mechanics
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Margaret
,
I
'm
right
glad
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
do
n't
think
you
've
heard
the
best
bit
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Now
that
a
way
seemed
open
to
me
,
of
not
being
a
burden
to
any
one
,
though
it
did
please
God
to
make
me
blind
,
I
thought
I
'd
tell
grandfather
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
tell'd
<EOS>
him
about
the
singing
and
the
sovereign
last
night
,
for
I
thought
I
'd
not
send
him
to
bed
wi
'
a
heavy
heart
;
but
this
morning
I
telled
him
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
did
he
take
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
not
a
man
of
many
words
;
and
it
took
him
by
surprise
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
at
that
;
I
've
noticed
it
in
your
ways
ever
since
you
telled
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
that
's
it
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
'd
not
telled
you
,
and
you
'd
seen
me
every
day
,
you
'd
not
ha
'
noticed
the
little
mite
o
'
difference
fra
'
day
to
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
what
did
your
grandfather
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mary
,
"
said
Margaret
,
half
smiling
,
"
I
'm
a
bit
loth
to
tell
yo
,
for
unless
yo
knew
grandfather
's
ways
like
me
<EOS>
,
yo'd
think
it
strange
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
taken
by
surprise
,
and
he
said
:
"
Damn
yo
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
he
began
looking
at
his
book
as
it
were
,
and
were
very
quiet
,
while
I
telled
him
all
about
it
;
how
I
'd
feared
,
and
how
downcast
I
'd
been
;
and
how
I
were
now
reconciled
to
it
,
if
it
were
th
'
Lord
's
will
;
and
how
I
hoped
to
earn
money
by
singing
;
and
<EOS>
while
I
were
talking
,
I
saw
great
big
tears
come
dropping
on
th
'
book
;
but
in
course
I
never
let
on
that
I
saw
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
grandfather
!
<EOS>
and
all
day
long
he
's
been
quietly
moving
things
out
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
my
way
,
as
he
thought
might
trip
me
up
,
and
putting
things
in
my
way
as
he
thought
I
might
want
;
never
knowing
I
saw
and
felt
what
he
were
doing
;
for
,
yo
see
,
he
thinks
I
'm
out
and
out
blind
<EOS>
,
I
guess
 
as
I
shall
be
soon
.
"
  
<EOS>
Margaret
sighed
in
spite
of
her
cheerful
and
relieved
tone
.
  
<EOS>
Though
Mary
caught
the
sigh
,
she
felt
it
was
better
to
let
it
pass
without
notice
,
and
began
,
with
the
tact
which
true
sympathy
rarely
fails
to
supply
,
to
ask
a
variety
of
questions
respecting
her
friend
's
musical
debut
,
which
tended
to
bring
out
more
distinctly
how
successful
it
had
been
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Margaret
,
"
at
length
she
exclaimed
,
"
thou'lt
become
as
famous
,
maybe
,
as
that
grand
lady
fra
'
London
as
we
see'd
one
night
driving
up
to
th
'
concert
-
room
door
in
her
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
looks
very
like
it
,
"
said
Margaret
,
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
be
sure
,
Mary
,
I
'll
not
forget
to
give
thee
a
lift
now
<EOS>
and
then
when
that
comes
about
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
who
knows
,
if
thou'rt
a
good
girl
,
but
may
-
happen
<EOS>
I
may
make
thee
my
lady
's
maid
!
 
<EOS>
Would
n't
that
be
nice
?
 
<EOS>
So
I
e'en
sing
to
myself
th
'
beginning
o
'
<EOS>
one
o
'
my
songs
   
"
An
'
ye
shall
walk
in
silk
attire
,
 
An
'
siller
hae
to
spare
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
do
n't
stop
;
or
else
give
me
something
rather
more
new
,
for
somehow
I
never
quite
liked
that
part
about
thinking
o
'
Donald
mair
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
though
I
'm
a
bit
tired
I
do
n't
care
if
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
Before
I
come
I
were
practising
well
-
nigh
upon
two
hours
this
one
which
I
'm
to
sing
o
'
Thursday
.
 
<EOS>
The
lecturer
said
he
were
sure
it
would
just
suit
me
,
and
I
should
do
justice
to
it
;
and
I
should
be
right
sorry
to
disappoint
him
,
he
were
so
nice
and
encouraging
like
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
!
<EOS>
Mary
,
what
a
pity
<EOS>
there
is
n't
more
o
'
that
way
,
and
less
scolding
and
rating
i
'
th
'
world
!
 
<EOS>
It
would
go
a
vast
deal
further
.
 
<EOS>
Beside
,
some
o
'
th
'
singers
said
,
they
were
a'most
certain
that
it
were
a
song
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
his
own
,
because
he
were
so
fidgety
and
particular
about
it
,
and
so
anxious
I
should
give
it
th
'
proper
expression
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
makes
me
care
still
more
.
 
<EOS>
Th
'
first
verse
,
he
said
,
were
to
be
sung
"
tenderly
,
but
joyously
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
I
do
n't
quite
hit
that
,
but
I
'll
try
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
single
word
can
do
!
<EOS>
Thrilling
all
the
heart
-
strings
through
,
 
Calling
forth
fond
memories
,
 
Raining
round
hope
's
melodies
,
 
Steeping
all
in
one
bright
hue
 
<EOS>
What
a
single
word
can
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
it
falls
into
th
'
minor
key
,
and
must
be
very
sad
-
like
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
could
do
that
better
than
t'other
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
single
word
can
do
!
<EOS>
Making
life
seem
all
untrue
,
 
Driving
joy
and
hope
away
,
 
Leaving
not
one
cheering
ray
,
 
Blighting
every
flower
that
grew
 
What
a
single
word
can
do
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
Margaret
certainly
made
the
most
of
this
little
song
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
factory
worker
,
listening
outside
,
observed
,
"
She
spun
it
<EOS>
reet
<EOS>
*
fine
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
if
she
only
sang
it
at
the
Mechanics
'
with
half
the
feeling
she
put
into
it
that
night
,
the
lecturer
must
have
been
hard
to
please
if
he
did
not
admit
that
his
expectations
were
more
than
fulfilled
.
  
<EOS>
When
it
was
ended
,
Mary
's
looks
told
more
than
words
could
have
done
what
she
thought
of
it
;
and
partly
to
keep
in
a
tear
which
would
fain
have
rolled
out
,
she
brightened
into
a
laugh
,
and
said
,
"
For
certain
th
'
carriage
is
coming
.
 
<EOS>
So
let
us
go
and
dream
on
it
.

<EOS>
The
next
evening
it
was
a
warm
,
pattering
,
incessant
rain
 
<EOS>
just
the
rain
to
waken
up
the
flowers
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
Manchester
,
where
,
alas
!
<EOS>
there
are
no
flowers
,
the
rain
had
only
a
disheartening
and
gloomy
effect
;
the
streets
were
wet
and
dirty
,
the
drippings
from
the
houses
were
wet
and
dirty
,
and
the
people
were
wet
and
dirty
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
most
kept
within
doors
;
and
there
was
an
unusual
silence
of
footsteps
in
the
little
paved
courts
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
had
to
change
her
clothes
after
her
walk
home
;
and
had
hardly
settled
herself
before
she
heard
some
one
fumbling
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
The
noise
continued
long
enough
to
allow
her
to
get
up
,
and
go
and
open
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
stood
 
<EOS>
could
it
be
?
<EOS>
yes
it
was
,
her
father
!
  
<EOS>
Drenched
and
wayworn
,
there
he
stood
!
 
<EOS>
He
came
in
with
no
word
to
Mary
in
return
for
her
cheery
and
astonished
greeting
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
down
by
the
fire
in
his
wet
things
,
unheeding
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mary
would
not
let
him
so
rest
.
 
<EOS>
She
ran
up
and
brought
down
his
working
-
day
clothes
,
and
went
into
the
pantry
to
rummage
up
their
little
bit
of
provision
while
he
changed
by
the
fire
,
talking
all
the
while
as
gaily
as
she
could
,
though
her
father
's
depression
hung
like
lead
on
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
For
Mary
,
in
her
seclusion
at
Miss
Simmonds
'
,
 
where
the
chief
talk
was
of
fashions
,
and
dress
,
and
parties
to
be
given
,
for
which
such
and
such
gowns
would
be
wanted
,
varied
with
a
slight
-
whispered
interlude
occasionally
about
love
and
lovers
 
had
not
heard
the
political
news
of
the
day
;
that
Parliament
had
refused
to
listen
to
the
working
-
men
,
when
they
petitioned
,
with
all
the
force
of
their
rough
,
untutored
words
,
to
be
heard
concerning
the
distress
which
was
riding
,
like
the
Conqueror
on
his
Pale
Horse
,
among
the
people
;
which
was
crushing
their
lives
out
of
them
,
and
stamping
woe
-
marks
over
the
land
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
eaten
and
was
refreshed
,
they
sat
for
some
time
in
silence
;
for
Mary
wished
him
to
tell
her
what
oppressed
him
so
,
yet
durst
not
ask
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
she
was
wise
;
for
when
we
are
heavy
-
laden
in
our
hearts
it
falls
in
better
with
our
humour
to
reveal
our
case
in
our
own
way
,
and
our
own
time
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
sat
on
a
stool
at
her
father
's
feet
in
old
childish
guise
,
and
stole
her
hand
into
his
,
while
his
sadness
infected
her
,
and
she
"
caught
the
trick
of
grief
,
and
sighed
,
"
she
knew
not
why
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mary
,
we
mun
speak
to
our
God
to
hear
us
,
for
man
will
not
hearken
;
no
,
not
now
,
when
we
weep
tears
o
'
blood
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
an
instant
Mary
understood
the
fact
,
if
not
the
details
,
that
so
weighed
down
her
father
's
heart
.
 
<EOS>
She
pressed
his
hand
with
silent
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
know
what
to
say
,
and
was
so
afraid
of
speaking
wrongly
,
that
she
was
silent
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
his
attitude
had
remained
unchanged
for
more
than
half
-
an
-
hour
,
his
eyes
gazing
vacantly
and
fixedly
at
the
fire
,
no
sound
<EOS>
but
now
and
then
a
deep
-
drawn
sigh
to
break
the
weary
ticking
of
the
clock
,
and
the
drip
-
drop
from
the
roof
without
,
Mary
could
bear
it
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Anything
to
rouse
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
Even
bad
news
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
do
you
know
George
Wilson
's
dead
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
Her
hand
was
suddenly
and
almost
violently
compressed
.
)
 
<EOS>
"
He
dropped
down
dead
in
Oxford
Road
yester
morning
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
very
sad
,
is
n't
it
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
tears
were
ready
to
flow
as
she
looked
up
in
her
father
's
face
for
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
Still
the
same
fixed
look
of
despair
,
not
varied
by
grief
for
the
dead
.
  
<EOS>
"
Best
for
him
to
die
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
unbearable
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
got
up
under
pretence
of
going
to
tell
Margaret
that
she
need
not
come
to
sleep
with
her
to
-
night
,
but
really
to
ask
Job
Legh
to
come
and
cheer
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
She
stopped
outside
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
was
practising
her
singing
,
and
through
the
still
night
air
her
voice
rang
out
,
like
that
of
an
angel
   
"
Comfort
ye
,
comfort
ye
,
my
people
,
saith
your
God
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
Hebrew
prophetic
words
fell
like
dew
on
Mary
's
heart
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
interrupt
.
 
<EOS>
She
stood
listening
and
"
comforted
,
"
till
the
little
buzz
of
conversation
again
began
,
and
then
entered
and
told
her
errand
.
  
<EOS>
Both
grandfather
and
grand
-
daughter
rose
instantly
to
fulfil
her
request
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
just
tired
out
,
Mary
,
"
said
old
Job
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
'll
be
a
different
man
to

morrow

"
  
<EOS>
There
is
no
describing
the
looks
and
tones
that
have
power
over
an
aching
,
heavy
-
laden
heart
;
but
in
an
hour
or
so
John
Barton
was
talking
away
as
freely
as
ever
,
though
all
his
talk
ran
,
as
was
natural
,
on
the
disappointment
of
his
fond
hope
,
of
the
forlorn
hope
of
many
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
London
's
a
fine
place
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
finer
folk
live
in
it
than
I
ever
thought
on
,
or
ever
heerd
tell
on
except
in
th

storybooks

<EOS>
They
are
having
their
good
things
now
,
that
afterwards
they
may
be
tormented
.
"
  
<EOS>
Still
at
the
old
parable
of
Dives
and
Lazarus
!
 
<EOS>
Does
it
haunt
the
minds
of
the
rich
as
it
does
those
of
the
poor
?
  
<EOS>
"
Do
tell
us
all
about
London

asked
Mary
,
who
was
sitting
at
her
old
post
by
her
father
's
knee

turning

there
were
a
day
appointed

house

spread
for
breakfast

ha

down
to

I
suppose

thought

wanted
putting
in

There
were
mutton

more

I
could

could
eat

little

stuck
in

thought
o

them
at

wives

little
ones

had
,
maybe
at

very
time

nought

after
breakfast

we
were
all
set
to
walk
in
procession

time
it
took
to
put
us
in
order
,
two
and
two
,
and
the
petition
,
as
was
yards
long
,
carried
by
the
foremost
pairs

The
men
looked
grave
enough

may

I
were
fat
and
rosy
to
many
a
one
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
we
walked
on
and
on
through
many
a
street
,
much
the
same
as
Deansgate
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
to
walk
slowly
,
slowly
,
for
th
'
carriages
an
'
cabs
as
thronged
th
'
streets
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
by
-
and
-
bye
we
should
maybe
get
clear
on
'em
,
but
as
the
streets
grew
wider
they
grew
worse
,
and
at
last
we
were
fairly
blocked
up
at
Oxford
Street
.
 
<EOS>
We
getten
across
it
after
a
while
though
,
and
my
eyes
!
<EOS>
the
grand
streets
we
were
in
then
!
<EOS>
They
're
sadly
puzzled
how
to
build
houses
though
in
London
;
there
'd
be
an
opening
for
a
good
steady
master
builder
there
,
as
know'd
his
business
.
 
<EOS>
For
yo
see
the
houses
are
many
on
'em
built
without
any
proper
shape
for
a
body
to
live
in
;
some
on
'em
<EOS>
they
've
after
thought
would
fall
down
,
so
they
've
stuck
great
ugly
pillars
out
before
'em
.
 
<EOS>
And
some
on
'em
(
we
thought
they
must
be
th
'
tailors
'
sign
)
had
getten
stone
men
and
women
as
wanted
clothes
stuck
on
'em
.
<EOS>
I
were
like
a
child
,
I
forgot
a
'
my
errand
in
looking
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
it
were
dinner
-
time
,
or
better
,
as
we
could
tell
by
the
sun
,
right
above
our
heads
,
and
we
were
dusty
and
tired
,
going
a
step
now
and
a
step
then
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
at
last
we
getten
into
a
street
grander
nor
all
,
leading
to
th
'
Queen
's
palace
,
and
there
it
were
<EOS>
I
thought
I
saw
th
'
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
Yo've
seen
th
'
hearses
wi
'
white
plumes
,
Job
?
"
  
<EOS>
Job
assented
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
them
undertaker
folk
are
driving
a
pretty
trade
in
London
.
<EOS>
Well
-
nigh
<EOS>
every
lady
we
saw
in
a
carriage
had
hired
one
o
'
them
plumes
for
the
day
,
and
had
it
niddle
noddling
on
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
It
were
the
Queen
's
Drawing
-
room
,
they
said
,
and
the
carriages
went
bowling
along
towards
her
house
,
some
wi
'
dressed
-
up
gentlemen
like
circus
folk
in
'em
,
and
rucks
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
o
'
ladies
in
others
.
 
<EOS>
Carriages
themselves
were
great
shakes
too
.
 
<EOS>
Some
o
'
<EOS>
the
gentlemen
as
could
n't
get
inside
hung
on
behind
,
wi
'
nosegays
to
smell
at
,
and
sticks
to
keep
off
folk
as
might
splash
their
silk
stockings
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
why
they
did
n't
hire
a
cab
rather
than
hang
on
like
a
whip
-
behind
boy
;
but
I
suppose
they
wished
to
keep
wi
'
their
wives
,
Darby
and
Joan
like
.
 
<EOS>
Coachmen
were
little
squat
men
,
wi
'
wigs
like
the
oud
-
fashioned
parsons
'
.
<EOS>
Well
,
we
could
na
get
on
for
these
carriages
,
though
we
waited
and
waited
.
 
<EOS>
Th
'
horses
were
too
fat
to
move
quick
;
they
never
known
want
o
'
food
,
one
might
tell
by
their
sleek
coats
;
and
police
pushed
us
back
when
we
tried
to
cross
.
 
<EOS>
One
or
two
of
'em
struck
wi
'
their
sticks
,
and
coachmen
laughed
,
and
some
officers
as
stood
nigh
put
their
spy
-
glasses
in
their
eye
,
and
left
'em
sticking
there
like
mountebanks
.
 
<EOS>
One
o
'
th
'
police
struck
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whatten
business
have
you
to
do
that
?
"
said
<EOS>
I.
     
<EOS>
"
"
You
're
frightening
them
horses
,
"
says
he
,
in
his
mincing
way
(
for
Londoners
are
mostly
all
tongue
-
tied
,
and
ca
n't
say
their
a
's
<EOS>
and
i
's
properly
,
"
and
it
's
our
business
to
keep
you
from
molesting
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
going
to
her
Majesty
's
Drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
And
why
are
we
to
be
molested
?
"
asked
I
,
"
going
decently
about
our
business
,
which
is
life
and
death
to
us
,
and
many
a
little
one
clemming
at
home
in
Lancashire
?
 
<EOS>
Which
business
is
of
most
consequence
<EOS>
i
'
the
sight
<EOS>
o
'
God
,
think
yo
,
ourn
or
them
grand
ladies
and
gentlemen
as
yo
think
so
much
on
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
might
as
well
ha
'
held
my
peace
,
for
he
only
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
John
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
After
waiting
a
little
,
to
see
if
he
would
go
on
himself
,
Job
said
   
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
that
's
not
a
'
your
story
,
man
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
us
what
happened
when
you
got
to
th
'
Parliament
House
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
a
little
pause
,
John
answered
   
"
If
you
please
,
neighbour
,
I
'd
rather
say
nought
about
that
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
to
be
forgotten
,
or
forgiven
either
,
by
me
or
many
another
;
but
I
canna
tell
of
our
down
-
casting
just
as
a
piece
of
London
news
.
 
<EOS>
As
long
as
I
live
,
our
rejection
of
that
day
will
abide
in
my
heart
;
and
as
long
as
I
live
I
shall
curse
them
as
so
cruelly
refused
to
hear
us
;
but
I
'll
not
speak
of
it
<EOS>
no
*
more
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
So
,
daunted
in
their
inquiries
,
they
sat
silent
for
a
few
minutes
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Job
,
however
,
felt
that
some
one
must
speak
,
else
all
the
good
they
had
done
in
dispelling
John
Barton
's
gloom
was
lost
.
 
<EOS>
So
after
a
while
he
thought
of
a
subject
,
neither
sufficiently
dissonant
from
the
last
to
jar
on
a
full
heart
,
nor
too
much
the
same
to
cherish
the
continuance
of
the
gloomy
train
of
thought
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
hear
tell
,
"
said
he
to
Mary
,
"
that
I
were
in
London
once
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
she
with
surprise
,
and
looking
at
Job
with
increased
respect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
but
I
were
though
,
and
Peg
there
too
,
though
she
minds
nought
about
it
,
poor
wench
!
 
<EOS>
You
must
know
<EOS>
I
had
<EOS>
but
one
child
,
and
<EOS>
she
were
Margaret
's
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
loved
her
above
a
bit
,
and
one
day
when
she
came
(
standing
behind
me
for
that
<EOS>
I
should
not
see
her
blushes
,
and
stroking
my
cheeks
in
her
own
coaxing
way
)
,
and
told
me
she
and
Frank
Jennings
(
as
was
a
joiner
lodging
near
us
)
should
be
so
happy
<EOS>
if
they
were
married
,
I
could
not
find
in
my
heart
t
'
say
her
nay
,
though
I
went
sick
at
the
thought
of
losing
her
away
from
my
home
.
<EOS>
However
,
she
was
my
only
child
,
and
I
never
said
nought
of
what
I
felt
,
for
fear
o
'
grieving
her
young
heart
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
tried
to
think
o
'
the
time
when
I
'd
been
young
mysel
,
and
had
loved
her
blessed
mother
,
and
how
we
'd
left
father
and
mother
,
and
gone
out
into
th
'
world
together
,
and
I
'm
now
right
thankful
<EOS>
I
held
my
peace
,
and
didna
fret
her
wi
'
telling
her
how
sore
I
was
at
parting
wi
'
her
that
were
the
light
o
'
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
you
said
the
young
man
were
a
neighbour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
so
he
were
,
and
his
father
afore
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
work
were
rather
slack
in
Manchester
,
and
Frank
's
uncle
sent
him
<EOS>
word
o
'
London
work
and
London
wages
,
so
he
were
to
go
there
,
and
it
were
there
<EOS>
Margaret
was
to
follow
him
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
my
heart
aches
yet
at
thought
of
those
days
.
 
<EOS>
She
<EOS>
so
happy
,
and
he
so
happy
;
only
the
poor
father
as
fretted
sadly
behind
their
backs
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
married
and
stayed
some
days
wi
'
me
afore
setting
off
;
and
I
've
often
thought
sin
'
,
Margaret
's
heart
failed
her
many
a
time
those
few
days
,
and
she
would
fain
ha
'
spoken
;
but
I
knew
fra
'
mysel
it
were
better
to
keep
it
pent
up
,
and
I
never
let
on
what
I
were
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
what
she
meant
when
she
came
kissing
,
and
holding
my
hand
,
and
all
her
old
childish
ways
o
'
loving
me
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
they
went
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
them
two
letters
,
Margaret
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sure
,
"
replied
his
grand
-
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
them
two
were
the
only
letters
I
ever
had
fra
<EOS>
'
her
,
poor
lass
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
in
them
she
were
very
happy
,
and
I
believe
she
were
.
<EOS>
And
Frank
's
family
heard
he
were
in
good
work
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
o
'
her
letters
,
poor
thing
,
she
ends
wi
'
saying
,
"
Farewell
,
Grandad
!
"
<EOS>
wi
'
a
line
drawn
under
grandad
,
and
fra
'
that
an
'
other
hints
I
knew
she
were
in
th
'
family
way
;
and
<EOS>
I
said
nought
,
but
I
screwed
up
a
little
money
,
thinking
come
<EOS>
Whitsuntide
<EOS>
I
'd
take
a
holiday
and
go
and
see
her
an
'
th
'
little
one
.
 
<EOS>
But
one
day
towards
Whitsuntide
,
comed
Jennings
wi
'
a
grave
face
,
and
says
he
,
"
I
hear
our
Frank
and
your
Margaret
's
both
getten
the
fever
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
You
might
ha
'
knocked
me
down
wi
'
a
straw
,
for
it
seemed
as
if
God
told
me
what
th
'
upshot
would
be
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Jennings
had
gotten
a
letter
,
you
see
,
fra
'
the
landlady
they
lodged
wi
'
;
a
well
-
penned
letter
,
asking
if
they
'd
no
friends
to
come
and
nurse
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
'd
caught
it
first
,
and
Frank
,
who
was
as
tender
<EOS>
o'er
her
as
her
own
mother
could
ha
'
been
,
had
nursed
her
till
he
'd
caught
it
himsel
;
and
she
expecting
her
down-
lying
*
everyday
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
t
'
make
a
long
story
short
,
old
Jennings
<EOS>
and
I
went
up
by
that
night
's
coach
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
see
,
Mary
<EOS>
,
that
was
the
way
I
got
to
London
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
But
how
was
your
daughter
when
you
got
there
?
"
asked
Mary
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
were
at
rest
,
poor
wench
,
and
so
were
Frank
.
 
<EOS>
I
guessed
as
much
when
I
see'd
th
'
landlady
's
face
,
all
swelled
wi
'
crying
,
when
she
opened
th
'
door
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
We
said
,
"
Where
are
they
?
"
<EOS>
and
I
knew
they
were
dead
<EOS>
,
fra
'
her
look
;
but
Jennings
did
n't
,
as
I
take
it
;
for
when
she
showed
us
into
a
room
wi
'
a
white
sheet
on
th
'
bed
,
and
underneath
it
,
plain
to
be
seen
,
two
still
figures
,
he
screeched
out
as
if
he
'd
been
a
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
he
'd
<EOS>
other
children
<EOS>
and
I
'd
none
.
 
<EOS>
There
lay
my
darling
,
my
only
one
.
 
<EOS>
She
were
dead
,
and
there
were
no
one
to
love
me
,
no
,
not
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
disremember
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
rightly
what
I
did
;
but
I
know
I
were
very
quiet
,
while
my
heart
were
crushed
within
me
.
     
<EOS>
"
Jennings
could
na
'
stand
being
in
the
room
at
all
,
so
the
landlady
took
him
down
,
and
I
were
glad
to
be
alone
.
 
<EOS>
It
grew
dark
while
I
sat
there
;
and
at
last
th
'
landlady
came
up
again
,
and
said
,
"
Come
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
I
got
up
,
and
walked
into
the
light
,
but
I
had
to
hold
by
th
'
stair
-
rails
<EOS>
,
I
were
so
weak
and
dizzy
.
 
<EOS>
She
led
me
into
a
room
,
where
Jennings
lay
on
a
sofa
fast
asleep
,
wi
'
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
over
his
head
for
a
night
-
cap
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
he
'd
cried
himself
fairly
off
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
tea
on
th
'
table
all
ready
;
for
she
were
a
kind
-
hearted
body
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
still
said
,
"
Come
here
,
"
and
took
hold
o
'
my
arm
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
went
round
the
table
,
and
there
were
a
clothes
-
basket
by
th
'
fire
,
wi
'
a
shawl
put
<EOS>
o'er
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lift
that
up
,
"
says
she
,
and
I
did
;
and
there
lay
a
little
wee
babby
fast
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
gave
a
leap
,
and
th
'
tears
comed
rushing
into
my
eyes
first
time
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
hers
?
"
said
I
,
though
I
knew
it
were
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
were
getting
a
bit
better
<EOS>
o
'
the
fever
,
and
th
'
<EOS>
babby
were
born
;
and
then
the
poor
young
man
took
worse
and
died
,
and
she
were
not
many
hours
behind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Little
mite
of
a
thing
!
<EOS>
and
yet
it
seemed
her
angel
come
back
to
comfort
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
were
quite
jealous
<EOS>
o
'
Jennings
<EOS>
whenever
he
went
near
the
babby
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
it
were
more
my
flesh
and
blood
than
his'n
,
and
yet
I
were
afraid
he
would
claim
it
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
that
were
far
enough
fra
'
his
thoughts
;
he
'd
plenty
other
childer
,
and
,
as
I
found
out
after
,
he
'd
all
along
been
wishing
me
to
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
we
buried
Margaret
and
her
husband
in
a
big
,
crowded
,
lonely
churchyard
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
I
were
loath
to
leave
them
there
,
as
I
thought
,
<EOS>
when
they
rose
again
,
they
'd
feel
so
strange
at
first
away
fra
'
Manchester
,
and
all
old
friends
;
but
it
could
na
be
helped
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
God
watches
o'er
their
graves
there
as
well
as
here
.
 
<EOS>
That
funeral
cost
a
mint
o
'
money
,
but
Jennings
and
I
wished
to
do
th
'
thing
decent
.
 
<EOS>
Then
we
'd
the
stout
little
babby
to
bring
home
.
 
<EOS>
We
'd
not
overmuch
money
left
;
but
it
were
fine
weather
,
and
we
thought
we
'd
take
th
'
coach
to
Brummagem
,
and
walk
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
were
a
bright
May
morning
when
I
last
saw
London
town
,
looking
back
from
a
big
hill
a
mile
or
two
off
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
that
big
mass
o
'
a
place
I
were
leaving
my
blessed
child
asleep
 
in
her
last
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
God
's
will
be
done
!
<EOS>
She
's
gotten
to
heaven
afore
me
;
but
I
shall
get
there
at
last
,
please
God
,
though
it
's
a
long
while
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
babby
had
been
fed
afore
we
set
out
,
and
th
'
coach
moving
kept
it
asleep
,
bless
its
little
heart
!
 
<EOS>
But
when
th
'
coach
stopped
for
dinner
it
were
awake
,
and
crying
for
its
pobbies
.
<EOS>
*
 
<EOS>
So
we
asked
for
some
bread
and
milk
,
and
Jennings
took
it
first
for
to
feed
it
,
but
it
made
its
mouth
like
a
square
,
and
let
it
run
out
at
each
o
'
the
four
corners
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shake
it
,
Jennings
,
"
says
I
;
"
that
's
the
way
they
make
water
run
through
a
funnel
,
when
it
's
o'er
full
;
and
a
child
's
mouth
is
broad
end
<EOS>
o
'
th
'
funnel
,
and
th
'
gullet
the
narrow
one
.
"
<EOS>
So
he
shook
it
,
but
it
only
cried
th
'
more
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
have
it
,
"
says
I
,
thinking
he
were
an
awkward
oud
chap
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
were
just
as
bad
<EOS>
wi
'
me
.
 
<EOS>
By
shaking
th
'
babby
we
got
better
nor
a
gill
into
its
mouth
,
but
more
nor
that
came
up
again
,
wetting
a
'
th
'
nice
dry
clothes
landlady
had
put
on
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
just
as
we
'd
gotten
to
th
'
dinner
-
table
,
and
helped
oursels
,
and
eaten
two
mouthful
,
came
in
th
'
guard
,
and
a
fine
chap
wi
'
a
sample
of
calico
flourishing
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Coach
is
ready
!
"
<EOS>
says
one
;
"
Half
-
a
-
crown
your
dinner
!
"
says
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
we
thought
it
a
deal
for
both
our
dinners
,
when
we
'd
hardly
tasted
'em
;
but
,
bless
your
life
,
it
were
half
-
a
-
crown
apiece
,
and
a
shilling
for
th
'
bread
and
milk
as
were
possetted
all
over
babby
's
clothes
.
 
<EOS>
We
spoke
up
again
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
it
<EOS>
;
but
everybody
said
it
were
the
rule
,
so
what
could
two
poor
oud
chaps
like
us
do
again
it
?
<EOS>
Well
,
poor
babby
cried
without
stopping
to
take
breath
,
fra
'
<EOS>
that
time
till
we
got
to
Brummagem
for
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
ached
for
th
'
little
thing
.
 
<EOS>
It
caught
wi
'
its
wee
mouth
at
our
coat
sleeves
and
at
our
mouths
,
when
we
tried
t
'
comfort
it
by
talking
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
little
wench
!
<EOS>
it
wanted
its
mammy
,
as
were
lying
cold
in
th
'
grave
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
says
I
,
"
it
'll
be
clemmed
to
death
,
if
it
lets
out
its
supper
as
it
did
its
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Let
's
get
some
woman
to
feed
it
;
it
comes
natural
to
women
to
do
for
babbies
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
we
asked
th
'
chambermaid
at
the
inn
,
and
she
took
quite
kindly
to
it
;
and
we
got
a
good
supper
,
and
grew
rare
and
sleepy
,
what
wi
'
th
'
warmth
and
wi
'
our
long
ride
i
'
the
open
air
.
 
<EOS>
Th
'
chambermaid
said
she
would
like
t
'
have
it
t
'
sleep
wi
'
her
,
only
missis
would
scold
so
;
but
it
looked
so
quiet
and
smiling
like
,
as
it
lay
in
her
arms
,
that
we
thought
'
t
would
be
no
trouble
to
have
it
<EOS>
wi
'
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
says
:
"
See
,
Jennings
<EOS>
,
how
women
folk
do
quieten
babbies
;
it
's
just
as
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
looked
grave
;
he
were
always
thoughtful
-
looking
,
though
I
never
heard
him
say
anything
very
deep
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
says
he
   
"
"
Young
woman
!
<EOS>
have
you
gotten
a
spare
nightcap
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Missis
always
keeps
nightcaps
for
gentlemen
as
does
not
like
to
unpack
,
"
says
she
,
rather
quick
.
     
<EOS>
"
"
Ay
,
but
young
woman
,
it
's
one
of
your
nightcaps
I
want
.
 
<EOS>
Th
'
babby
seems
to
have
taken
a
mind
to
yo
;
and
maybe
in
th
'
dark
it
might
take
me
for
yo
if
I
'd
getten
your
nightcap
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
chambermaid
smirked
and
went
for
a
cap
,
but
I
laughed
outright
at
th
'
oud
bearded
chap
thinking
he
'd
make
hissel
like
a
woman
just
by
putting
on
a
woman
's
cap
.
 
<EOS>
Howe'er
he
'd
not
be
laughed
out
on't
,
so
I
held
th
'
babby
till
he
were
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
night
as
we
had
on
it
!
 
<EOS>
Babby
began
to
scream
o
'
th
'
oud
fashion
,
and
we
took
it
turn
and
turn
about
to
sit
up
and
rock
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
were
very
sore
for
the
little
one
,
as
it
groped
about
wi
'
its
mouth
;
but
for
a
'
that
I
could
scarce
keep
fra
'
smiling
at
th
'
thought
<EOS>
o
'
us
two
oud
chaps
,
th
'
one
wi
'
a
woman
's
nightcap
on
,
sitting
on
our
hinder
ends
for
half
the
night
,
hushabying
a
babby
as
would
n't
be
hushabied
.
 
<EOS>
Toward
morning
,
poor
little
wench
!
<EOS>
it
fell
asleep
,
fairly
tired
out
wi
'
crying
,
but
even
in
its
sleep
it
gave
such
pitiful
sobs
,
quivering
up
fra
'
the
very
bottom
of
its
little
heart
,
that
once
or
twice
I
almost
wished
it
lay
on
its
mother
's
breast
,
at
peace
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Jennings
fell
asleep
too
;
but
I
began
for
to
reckon
up
our
money
.
<EOS>
It
were
little
enough
we
had
left
,
our
dinner
<EOS>
the
day
afore
had
ta'en
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
what
our
reckoning
would
be
for
that
night
lodging
,
and
supper
,
and
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
Doing
a
sum
always
sent
me
asleep
<EOS>
ever
sin
<EOS>
'
I
were
a
lad
;
so
I
fell
sound
in
a
short
time
,
and
were
only
wakened
by
chambermaid
tapping
at
th
'
door
,
to
say
she
'd
dress
the
babby
before
her
missis
were
up
if
we
liked
.
 
<EOS>
But
bless
yo
<EOS>
,
we
'd
never
thought
<EOS>
o
'
undressing
it
the
night
afore
,
and
now
it
were
sleeping
so
sound
,
and
we
were
so
glad
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
'
the
peace
and
quietness
,
that
we
thought
it
were
no
good
to
waken
it
up
to
screech
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
(
there
's
Mary
asleep
for
a
good
listener
!
)
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
're
getting
weary
of
my
tale
,
so
I
'll
not
be
long
over
ending
it
.
 
<EOS>
Th
'
reckoning
left
us
very
bare
,
and
we
thought
we
'd
best
walk
home
,
for
it
were
only
sixty
mile
,
they
telled
us
,
and
not
stop
again
for
nought
,
save
victuals
.
 
<EOS>
So
we
left
Brummagem
(
which
is
as
black
a
place
as
Manchester
,
without
looking
so
like
home
)
,
and
walked
a
'
that
day
,
carrying
babby
turn
and
turn
about
.
 
<EOS>
It
were
well
fed
by
<EOS>
chambermaid
afore
<EOS>
we
left
,
and
th
'
day
were
fine
,
and
folk
began
to
have
some
knowledge
o
'
th
'
proper
way
<EOS>
o
'
speaking
,
and
we
were
more
cheery
at
thought
<EOS>
o
'
home
(
though
mine
,
God
knows
,
were
lonesome
enough
)
.
 
<EOS>
We
stopped
none
for
dinner
,
but
at
baggin
-
time
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
we
getten
a
good
meal
at
a
public
-
house
,
an
'
fed
th
'
babby
as
well
as
we
could
,
but
that
were
but
poorly
.
 
<EOS>
We
got
a
crust
too
for
it
to
suck
 
chambermaid
put
us
up
to
that
.
 
<EOS>
That
night
,
whether
we
were
tired
or
whatten
,
I
do
n't
know
,
but
it
were
dree
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
work
,
and
th
'
poor
little
wench
had
slept
out
her
sleep
,
and
began
th
'
cry
as
wore
my
heart
out
again
.
 
<EOS>
Says
Jennings
,
says
<EOS>
he
   
<EOS>
"
"
We
should
na
ha
'
set
out
<EOS>
so
like
gentlefolk
<EOS>
a
top
o
'
the
coach
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
"
Nay
,
lad
!
 
<EOS>
We
should
ha
'
had
more
to
walk
if
we
had
na
ridden
,
and
I
'm
sure
both
you
and
I'se
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
weary
o
'
tramping
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
So
he
were
quiet
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
were
<EOS>
one
o
'
<EOS>
them
as
were
sure
to
find
out
somewhat
<EOS>
had
been
done
amiss
when
there
were
no
going
back
to
undo
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
presently
he
coughs
,
as
if
he
were
going
to
speak
,
and
I
says
to
myself
,
"
At
it
again
,
my
lad
.
"
 
<EOS>
Says
<EOS>
he
   
"
<EOS>
"
I
ax
pardon
,
neighbour
,
but
<EOS>
it
strikes
me
it
would
ha
'
been
better
for
my
son
if
he
had
never
begun
to
keep
company
wi
'
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
that
put
me
up
,
and
my
heart
got
very
full
,
and
but
that
I
were
carrying
HER
babby
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
should
ha
'
struck
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
I
could
hold
in
no
longer
,
and
says
<EOS>
I
   
"
"
Better
say
at
once
it
would
ha
'
been
better
for
God
never
to
ha
'
made
th
'
world
,
for
then
we
'd
never
ha
'
been
in
it
,
to
have
had
th
'
heavy
hearts
we
have
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
he
said
that
were
rank
blasphemy
;
but
I
thought
his
way
of
casting
up
again
th
'
events
God
had
pleased
to
send
,
were
worse
blasphemy
.
 
<EOS>
Howe'er
,
I
said
nought
more
angry
,
for
th
'
little
babby
's
sake
,
as
were
th
'
child
o
'
<EOS>
his
dead
son
,
as
well
as
o
'
my
dead
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Th
'
longest
lane
will
have
a
turning
,
and
that
night
came
to
an
end
at
last
;
and
we
were
footsore
and
tired
enough
,
and
to
my
mind
the
babby
were
getting
weaker
and
weaker
,
and
it
wrung
my
heart
to
hear
its
little
wail
!
 
<EOS>
I
'd
ha
'
given
my
right
hand
for
one
of
yesterday
's
hearty
cries
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
wanting
our
breakfasts
,
and
so
were
it
too
,
motherless
babby
!
 
<EOS>
We
could
see
no
public
-
houses
,
so
about
six
o'clock
(
only
we
thought
it
were
later
)
<EOS>
we
stopped
at
a
cottage
,
where
a
woman
were
moving
about
near
th
'
open
door
.
 
<EOS>
Says
I
,
"
Good
woman
,
may
we
rest
us
a
bit
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
"
says
she
,
wiping
a
chair
,
as
looked
bright
enough
afore
,
wi
'
her
apron
.
 
<EOS>
It
were
a
cheery
,
clean
room
;
and
we
were
glad
to
sit
down
again
,
though
I
thought
my
legs
would
never
bend
at
th
'
knees
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
minute
she
fell
a
noticing
th
'
babby
,
and
took
it
in
her
arms
,
and
kissed
it
again
and
again
.
<EOS>
"
Missis
,
"
says
I
,
"
we
're
not
without
money
and
if
yo'd
give
us
somewhat
for
breakfast
,
we
'd
pay
yo
honest
,
and
if
yo
would
wash
and
dress
that
poor
babby
,
and
get
some
pobbies
down
its
throat
,
for
it
's
well
-
nigh
clemmed
<EOS>
,
I
'd
pray
for
you
till
my
dying
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
she
said
nought
but
gived
me
th
'
babby
back
,
and
afore
you
could
say
Jack
Robinson
,
she
'd
a
pan
on
th
'
fire
,
and
bread
and
cheese
on
th
'
table
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
turned
round
,
her
face
looked
red
,
and
her
lips
were
tight
pressed
together
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
we
were
right
down
glad
on
our
breakfast
,
and
God
bless
and
reward
that
woman
for
her
kindness
that
day
!
 
<EOS>
She
fed
th
'
poor
babby
as
gently
and
softly
,
and
spoke
to
it
as
tenderly
as
its
own
poor
mother
could
ha
'
done
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
that
stranger
and
it
had
known
each
other
afore
,
maybe
in
heaven
,
where
folk
's
spirits
come
from
,
they
say
;
th
'
babby
looked
up
so
lovingly
in
her
eyes
,
and
made
little
noises
more
like
a
dove
than
aught
else
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
undressed
it
(
poor
darling
!
<EOS>
it
were
time
)
,
touching
it
so
softly
;
and
washed
it
from
head
to
foot
;
and
as
many
on
its
clothes
were
dirty
,
and
what
bits
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
things
its
mother
had
gotten
ready
for
it
had
been
sent
by
th
'
carrier
fra
'
London
<EOS>
,
she
put
'em
aside
;
and
wrapping
little
naked
babby
in
her
apron
,
she
pulled
out
a
key
,
as
were
fastened
to
a
black
ribbon
,
and
hung
down
her
breast
,
and
unlocked
a
drawer
in
th
'
dresser
.
 
<EOS>
I
were
sorry
to
be
prying
,
but
I
could
na
help
seeing
in
that
drawer
some
little
child
's
clothes
,
all
strewed
wi
'
lavender
,
and
lying
by
'em
a
little
whip
an
'
a
broken
rattle
.
 
<EOS>
I
began
to
have
an
insight
into
that
woman
's
heart
then
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
out
a
thing
or
two
and
locked
the
drawer
,
and
went
on
dressing
babby
.
 
<EOS>
Just
about
then
come
her
husband
down
,
a
great
big
fellow
as
did
n't
look
half
awake
,
though
it
were
getting
late
;
but
he
'd
heard
all
as
had
been
said
downstairs
,
as
were
plain
to
be
seen
;
but
he
were
a
gruff
chap
.
<EOS>
We
'd
finished
our
breakfast
,
and
Jennings
were
looking
hard
at
th
'
woman
as
she
were
getting
the
babby
to
sleep
wi
'
a
sort
of
rocking
way
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
says
he
,
"
I
ha
'
learnt
th
'
way
now
;
it
's
two
jiggits
and
a
shake
,
two
jiggits
and
a
shake
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
get
that
babby
asleep
<EOS>
now
mysel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
man
had
nodded
cross
enough
to
us
,
and
had
gone
to
th
'
door
,
and
stood
there
,
whistling
wi
'
his
hands
in
his
breeches
-
pockets
,
looking
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
last
he
turns
and
says
,
quite
sharp
   
"
"
I
say
,
<EOS>
missis
,
I
'm
to
have
no
breakfast
to
-
day
,
I
s'pose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
So
wi
'
that
she
kissed
th
'
child
,
a
long
,
soft
kiss
,
and
looking
in
my
face
to
see
if
I
could
take
her
meaning
,
gave
me
th
'
babby
without
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
were
loath
to
stir
,
but
I
saw
it
were
better
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
So
giving
Jennings
a
sharp
nudge
(
for
he
'd
fallen
asleep
)
,
I
says
,
"
Missis
,
what
's
to
pay
?
<EOS>
"
pulling
out
my
money
wi
'
a
jingle
that
she
might
na
guess
we
were
at
all
bare
o
'
cash
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
looks
at
her
husband
,
who
said
ne'er
a
word
,
but
were
listening
with
all
his
ears
nevertheless
;
and
when
she
saw
he
would
na
say
,
she
said
,
hesitating
,
as
if
 
pulled
two
ways
,
by
her
fear
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
'
him
,
"
Should
you
think
sixpence
over
much
?
"
 
<EOS>
It
were
so
different
to
public
-
house
reckoning
,
for
we
'd
eaten
a
main
deal
<EOS>
afore
the
chap
came
down
.
 
<EOS>
So
says
I
,
"
<EOS>
And
,
missis
,
what
should
we
gi
'
<EOS>
you
for
the
babby
's
bread
and
milk
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
I
had
it
once
in
my
mind
to
say
"
and
for
a
'
your
trouble
with
it
,
"
but
my
heart
would
na
let
me
say
it
,
for
I
could
read
in
her
ways
how
it
had
been
a
work
o
'
love
)
.
 
<EOS>
So
says
she
,
quite
quick
,
and
stealing
a
look
at
her
husband
's
back
,
as
looked
all
<EOS>
ear
,
if
ever
a
back
did
,
"
Oh
,
we
could
take
nought
for
the
little
babby
's
food
,
if
it
had
eaten
twice
as
much
,
bless
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Wi
'
that
he
looked
at
her
;
such
a
scowling
look
!
 
<EOS>
She
knew
what
he
meant
,
and
stepped
softly
across
the
floor
to
him
,
and
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem'd
<EOS>
as
though
he
'd
shake
it
off
by
a
jerk
on
his
elbow
,
but
she
said
quite
low
,
"
For
poor
little
Johnnie
's
sake
,
Richard
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
move
or
speak
again
,
and
after
looking
in
his
face
for
a
minute
,
she
turned
away
,
swallowing
deep
in
her
throat
.
<EOS>
She
kissed
th
'
sleeping
babby
as
she
passed
,
when
I
paid
her
.
 
<EOS>
To
quieten
th
'
gruff
husband
,
and
stop
him
if
he
rated
her
,
I
could
na
help
slipping
another
sixpence
under
th
'
loaf
,
and
then
we
set
off
again
.
 
<EOS>
Last
look
<EOS>
I
had
o
'
that
woman
she
were
quietly
wiping
her
eyes
wi
'
the
corner
of
her
apron
,
as
she
went
about
her
husband
's
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
shall
know
her
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
to
think
of
that
long
ago
May
morning
,
when
he
had
carried
his
grand
-
daughter
under
the
distant
hedgerows
and
beneath
the
flowering
sycamores
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
nought
more
to
say
,
wench
,
"
said
he
to
Margaret
,
as
she
begged
him
to
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
night
we
reached
Manchester
,
and
I
'd
found
out
that
Jennings
would
be
glad
enough
to
give
up
babby
to
me
,
so
I
took
her
home
at
once
,
and
a
blessing
she
's
been
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
all
silent
for
a
few
minutes
;
each
following
out
the
current
of
their
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
almost
simultaneously
,
their
attention
fell
upon
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
Sitting
on
her
little
stool
,
her
head
resting
on
her
father
's
knee
,
and
sleeping
as
soundly
as
any
infant
,
her
breath
(
still
like
an
infant
's
)
came
and
went
as
softly
as
a
bird
steals
to
her
leafy
nest
.
 
<EOS>
Her
half
-
open
mouth
was
as
scarlet
as
the
winter
-
berries
,
and
contrasted
finely
with
the
clear
paleness
of
her
complexion
,
where
the
eloquent
blood
flushed
carnation
at
each
motion
.
 
<EOS>
Her
black
eye
-
lashes
lay
on
the
delicate
cheek
,
which
was
still
more
shaded
by
the
masses
of
her
golden
hair
,
<EOS>
that
seemed
to
form
a
nest
-
like
pillar
for
her
as
she
lay
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
in
fond
pride
straightened
one
glossy
curl
,
for
an
instant
,
as
if
to
display
its
length
and
silkiness
.
  
<EOS>
The
little
action
awoke
her
,
and
,
like
nine
out
of
ten
people
in
similar
circumstances
,
she
exclaimed
,
opening
her
eyes
to
their
fullest
extent
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
awake
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Even
her
father
could
not
keep
from
smiling
,
and
Job
Legh
and
Margaret
laughed
outright
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
wench
,
"
said
Job
,
"
do
n't
look
so
gloppened
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
because
thou'st
fallen
asleep
while
an
oud
chap
like
me
was
talking
on
oud
times
.
<EOS>
It
were
like
enough
to
send
thee
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Try
if
thou
canst
keep
thine
eyes
open
while
I
read
thy
father
a
bit
on
a
poem
as
is
written
by
a
weaver
like
oursel
.
 
<EOS>
A
rare
chap
I
'll
be
bound
is
he
who
could
weave
verse
like
this
.
"
     
<EOS>
So
adjusting
his
spectacles
on
nose
,
cocking
his
chin
,
crossing
his
legs
,
and
coughing
to
clear
his
voice
,
he
read
aloud
a
little
poem
of
Samuel
Bamford
's
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
he
had
picked
up
somewhere
.
     
<EOS>
God
help
the
poor
,
who
,
on
this
wintry
morn
,
 
Come
forth
from
alleys
dim
and
courts
obscure
.
<EOS>
God
help
yon
poor
pale
girl
,
who
droops
forlorn
,
 
<EOS>
And
meekly
her
affliction
doth
endure
;
 
<EOS>
God
help
her
,
outcast
lamb
;
she
trembling
stands
,
 
<EOS>
All
wan
her
lips
,
and
frozen
red
her
hands
 
<EOS>
Her
sunken
eyes
are
modestly
downcast
,
 
<EOS>
Her
night
-
black
hair
streams
on
the
fitful
blast
;
 
<EOS>
Her
bosom
,
passing
fair
,
is
half
revealed
,
 
<EOS>
And
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
so
cold
,
the
snow
lies
there
congealed
;
 
Her
feet
benumbed
,
<EOS>
her
shoes
all
rent
and
worn
,
 
<EOS>
God
help
thee
,
outcast
lamb
,
who
standst
forlorn
!
<EOS>
God
help
the
poor
!
  
<EOS>
God
help
the
poor
!
<EOS>
An
infant
's
feeble
wail
 
Comes
from
yon
narrow
gateway
,
and
behold
!
<EOS>
A
female
crouching
there
,
so
deathly
pale
,
 
<EOS>
Huddling
her
child
,
to
screen
it
from
the
cold
;
 
Her
vesture
scant
,
her
bonnet
crushed
and
torn
;
 
A
thin
shawl
doth
her
baby
dear
enfold
.
<EOS>
And
so
she
'
bides
the
ruthless
gale
of
morn
,
 
Which
almost
to
her
heart
hath
sent
its
cold
.
<EOS>
And
now
she
,
sudden
,
darts
a
ravening
look
,
 
<EOS>
As
one
,
with
new
hot
bread
,
goes
past
the
nook
;
 
And
,
as
the
tempting
load
is
onward
borne
,
 
She
<EOS>
weeps
.
<EOS>
God
help
thee
,
helpless
one
,
forlorn
!
 
<EOS>
God
help
the
poor
!
  
<EOS>
God
help
the
poor
!
<EOS>
Behold
yon
famished
lad
,
 
No
shoes
,
nor
hose
,
his
wounded
feet
protect
;
 
With
limping
gait
,
and
looks
so
dreamy
sad
,
 
<EOS>
He
wanders
onward
,
stopping
to
inspect
 
<EOS>
Each
window
stored
with
articles
of
food
.
<EOS>
He
yearns
but
to
enjoy
one
cheering
meal
;
 
Oh
!
<EOS>
to
the
hungry
palate
viands
rude
 
<EOS>
Would
yield
a
zest
<EOS>
the
famished
only
feel
!
<EOS>
He
now
devours
a
crust
of
mouldy
bread
;
 
With
teeth
and
hands
the
precious
boon
is
torn
 
<EOS>
Unmindful
of
the
storm
that
round
his
head
 
Impetuous
sweeps
.
<EOS>
God
help
thee
,
child
forlorn
!
<EOS>
God
help
the
poor
!
  
<EOS>
God
help
the
poor
!
<EOS>
Another
have
I
found
 
A
bowed
and
venerable
man
is
he
;
His
slouch
-
ed
hat
with
faded
crape
is
bound
;
His
coat
is
grey
,
and
threadbare
too
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
"
The
rude
winds
"
seem
"
to
mock
his
hoary
hair
"
:
<EOS>
His
shirtless
bosom
to
the
blast
is
bare
.
<EOS>
Anon
he
turns
and
casts
a
wistful
eye
,
And
with
scant
napkin
wipes
the
blinding
spray
,
And
looks
around
,
as
if
he
fain
would
spy
Friends
he
had
feasted
in
his
better
day
:
Ah
!
<EOS>
some
are
dead
:
and
some
have
long
forborne
To
know
the
poor
;
and
he
is
left
forlorn
!
<EOS>
God
help
the
poor
!
  
<EOS>
God
help
the
poor
,
who
in
lone
valleys
dwell
,
Or
by
far
hills
,
where
whin
and
heather
grow
;
Theirs
is
a
story
sad
indeed
to
tell
;
Yet
little
cares
the
world
,
and
less
'
t
would
know
About
the
toil
and
want
men
undergo
.
<EOS>
The
wearying
loom
doth
call
them
up
at
morn
;
They
work
till
worn
-
out
nature
sinks
to
sleep
;
They
taste
,
but
are
not
fed
.
<EOS>
The
snow
drifts
deep
Around
the
fireless
cot
,
and
blocks
the
door
;
The
night
-
storm
howls
a
dirge
across
the
moor
;
<EOS>
And
shall
they
perish
thus
 
oppressed
and
lorn
?
<EOS>
Shall
toil
and
famine
,
hopeless
,
still
be
borne
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
God
will
yet
arise
and
help
the
poor
!
  
<EOS>
"
Amen
!
"
said
Barton
,
solemnly
and
sorrowfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mary
!
wench
,
couldst
thou
copy
me
them
lines
,
dost
think
?
 
<EOS>
that
's
to
say
,
if
Job
there
has
no
objection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
I.
 
<EOS>
More
they
're
heard
and
read
and
the
better
,
say
I.
"
  
<EOS>
So
Mary
took
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
next
day
,
on
a
blank
half
-
sheet
of
a
valentine
,
all
bordered
with
hearts
and
darts
 
a
valentine
she
had
once
suspected
to
come
from
Jem
Wilson
 
<EOS>
she
copied
Bamford
's
beautiful
little
poem
.
   
<EOS>
RETURN
OF
THE
PRODIGAL
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
heart
,
once
soft
as
woman
's
tear
,
is
gnarled
With
gloating
on
the
ills
I
can
not
cure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
ELLIOTT
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
guard
and
shield
her
innocence
,
Let
her
not
fall
like
me
;
'
Twere
better
,
oh
!
<EOS>
a
thousand
times
,
She
in
her
grave
should
be

"
  
<EOS>
The
Outcast
.
  
<EOS>
Despair
settled
down
like
a
heavy
cloud
;
and
now
and
then
,
through
the
dead
calm
of
sufferings
,
came
pipings
of
stormy
winds
,
foretelling
the
end
of
these
dark
prognostics
.
 
<EOS>
In
times
of
sorrowful
or
fierce
endurance
,
we
are
often
soothed
by
the
mere
repetition
of
old
proverbs
which
tell
the
experience
of
our
forefathers
;
but
now
,
"
it
's
a
long
lane
that
has
no
turning
,
"
"
the
weariest
day
draws
to
an
end
,
"
etc
.
,
seemed
false
and
vain
sayings
,
so
long
and
<EOS>
so
weary
was
the
pressure
of
the
terrible
times
.
 
<EOS>
Deeper
and
deeper
still
sank
the
poor
.
 
<EOS>
It
showed
how
much
lingering
suffering
it
takes
to
kill
men
,
that
so
few
(
in
comparison
)
died
during
those
times
.
 
<EOS>
But
remember
!
<EOS>
we
only
miss
those
who
do
men
's
work
in
their
humble
sphere
;
the
aged
,
the
feeble
,
the
children
,
when
they
die
,
are
hardly
noted
by
the
world
;
and
yet
to
many
hearts
,
their
deaths
make
a
blank
which
long
years
will
never
fill
up
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
,
too
,
that
though
it
may
take
much
suffering
to
kill
the
able
-
bodied
and
effective
members
of
society
,
it
does
NOT
take
much
to
reduce
them
to
worn
,
listless
,
diseased
creatures
,
who
thenceforward
crawl
through
life
with
moody
hearts
and
pain
-
stricken
bodies
.
  
<EOS>
The
people
had
thought
the
poverty
of
the
preceding
years
hard
to
bear
,
and
had
found
its
yoke
heavy
;
but
this
year
added
sorely
to
its
weight
.
 
<EOS>
Former
times
had
chastised
them
with
whips
,
but
this
chastised
them
with
scorpions
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
,
Barton
had
his
share
of
mere
bodily
sufferings
.
 
<EOS>
Before
he
had
gone
up
to
London
on
his
vain
errand
,
he
had
been
working
short
time
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
the
hopes
of
speedy
redress
by
means
of
the
interference
of
Parliament
,
he
had
thrown
up
his
place
;
and
now
,
when
he
asked
leave
to
resume
his
work
,
he
was
told
they
were
diminishing
their
number
of
hands
every
week
,
and
he
was
made
aware
,
by
the
remarks
of
fellow
-
workmen
,
that
a
Chartist
delegate
,
and
a
leading
member
of
a
Trades
'
Union
,
was
not
likely
to
be
favoured
in
his
search
after
employment
.
 
<EOS>
Still
he
tried
to
keep
up
a
brave
heart
concerning
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
he
could
bear
hunger
;
for
that
power
of
endurance
had
been
called
forth
when
he
was
a
little
child
,
and
had
seen
his
mother
hide
her
daily
morsel
to
share
it
among
her
children
,
and
when
he
,
being
the
eldest
,
had
told
the
noble
lie
,
that
"
he
was
not
hungry
,
could
not
eat
a
bit
more
,
"
in
order
to
imitate
his
mother
's
bravery
,
and
still
the
sharp
wail
of
the
younger
infants
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
,
too
,
was
secure
of
two
meals
a
day
at
Miss
Simmonds
'
;
though
,
by
the
way
,
the
dressmaker
too
,
feeling
the
effect
of
bad
times
,
had
left
off
giving
tea
to
her
apprentices
,
setting
them
the
example
of
long
abstinence
by
putting
off
her
own
meal
till
work
was
done
for
the
night
,
however
late
that
might
be
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
rent
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
half
-
a
-
crown
a
week
 
<EOS>
nearly
all
Mary
's
earnings
 
and
much
less
room
might
do
for
them
,
only
two
.
 
<EOS>
(
Now
came
the
time
to
be
thankful
that
the
early
dead
were
saved
from
the
evil
to
come
.
)
 
<EOS>
The
agricultural
labourer
generally
has
strong
local
attachments
;
but
they
are
far
less
common
,
almost
obliterated
,
among
the
inhabitants
of
a
town
.
 
<EOS>
Still
there
are
exceptions
,
and
Barton
formed
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
removed
to
his
present
house
just
after
the
last
bad
times
,
when
little
Tom
had
sickened
and
died
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
then
thought
the
bustle
of
a
removal
would
give
his
poor
stunned
wife
something
to
do
,
and
he
had
taken
more
interest
in
the
details
of
the
proceeding
than
he
otherwise
would
have
done
,
in
the
hope
of
calling
her
forth
to
action
again
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
seemed
to
know
every
brass
-
headed
nail
driven
up
for
her
convenience
.
 
<EOS>
Only
one
had
been
displaced
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Esther
's
bonnet
nail
,
which
in
his
deep
revengeful
anger
against
her
,
after
his
wife
's
death
,
he
had
torn
out
of
the
wall
,
and
cast
into
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
hard
work
to
leave
the
house
,
which
yet
seemed
hallowed
by
his
wife
's
presence
in
the
happy
days
of
old
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
a
law
unto
himself
,
though
sometimes
a
bad
,
fierce
law
;
and
he
resolved
to
give
the
rent
-
collector
notice
,
and
look
out
for
a
cheaper
abode
,
and
tell
Mary
they
must
flit
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Mary
!
<EOS>
she
loved
the
house
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
wrenching
up
her
natural
feelings
of
home
,
for
it
would
be
long
before
the
fibres
of
her
heart
would
gather
themselves
about
another
place
.
  
<EOS>
This
trial
was
spared
.
 
<EOS>
The
collector
(
of
himself
)
,
on
the
very
Monday
when
Barton
planned
to
give
him
notice
of
his
intention
to
leave
,
lowered
the
rent
threepence
a
week
,
just
enough
to
make
Barton
compromise
and
agree
to
stay
on
a
little
longer
.
  
<EOS>
But
by
degrees
the
house
was
stripped
of
all
its
little
ornaments
.
<EOS>
Some
were
broken
;
and
the
odd
twopences
and
threepences
,
wanted
to
pay
for
their
repairs
,
were
required
for
the
far
sterner
necessity
of
food
.
 
<EOS>
And
by
-
and
-
bye
Mary
began
to
part
with
other
superfluities
at
the
pawn
-
shop
.
 
<EOS>
The
smart
tea
-
tray
and
tea
-
caddy
,
long
and
carefully
kept
,
went
for
bread
for
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
ask
for
it
,
or
complain
,
but
she
saw
hunger
in
his
shrunk
,
fierce
,
animal
look
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
blankets
went
,
for
it
was
summer
time
,
and
they
could
spare
them
;
and
their
sale
made
a
fund
,
which
Mary
fancied
would
last
till
better
times
came
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
soon
all
gone
;
and
then
she
looked
around
the
room
to
crib
it
of
its
few
remaining
ornaments
.
 
<EOS>
To
all
these
proceedings
her
father
said
never
a
word
.
<EOS>
If
he
fasted
,
or
feasted
(
after
the
sale
of
some
article
)
on
an
unusual
meal
of
bread
and
cheese
,
he
took
all
with
a
sullen
indifference
,
which
depressed
Mary
's
heart
.
 
<EOS>
She
often
wished
he
would
apply
for
relief
from
the
Guardians
'
relieving
office
;
often
wondered
the
Trades
'
Union
did
nothing
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
when
she
asked
him
as
he
sat
,
grimed
,
unshaven
,
and
gaunt
,
after
a
day
's
fasting
,
over
the
fire
,
why
he
did
not
get
relief
from
the
town
,
he
turned
round
,
with
grim
wrath
,
and
said
,
"
I
do
n't
want
money
,
child
!
<EOS>
D####n
<EOS>
their
charity
and
their
money
!
 
<EOS>
I
want
work
,
and
it
is
my
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
would
bear
it
all
,
he
said
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
did
bear
it
,
but
not
meekly
;
that
was
too
much
to
expect
.
 
<EOS>
Real
meekness
of
character
is
called
out
by
experience
of
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
And
few
had
been
kind
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
through
it
all
,
with
stern
determination
he
refused
the
assistance
his
Trades
'
Union
would
have
given
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
not
much
to
give
,
but
,
with
worldly
wisdom
,
thought
it
better
to
propitiate
an
active
,
useful
member
,
than
to
help
those
who
were
more
unenergetic
,
though
they
had
large
families
to
provide
for
.
 
<EOS>
Not
so
thought
John
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
With
him
,
need
was
right
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
it
to
Tom
Darbyshire
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
more
claim
on
it
than
me
,
for
he
's
more
need
of
it
,
with
his
seven
children
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
Tom
Darbyshire
was
,
in
his
listless
,
grumbling
way
,
a
back
-
biting
enemy
of
John
Barton
's
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
knew
it
;
but
he
was
not
to
be
influenced
by
that
in
a
matter
like
this
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
went
early
to
her
work
;
but
her
cheery
laugh
over
it
was
now
missed
by
the
other
girls
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mind
wandered
over
the
present
distress
,
and
then
settled
,
as
she
stitched
,
on
the
visions
of
the
future
,
where
yet
her
thoughts
dwelt
more
on
the
circumstances
of
ease
,
and
the
pomps
and
vanities
awaiting
her
,
than
on
the
lover
with
whom
she
was
to
share
them
.
 
<EOS>
Still
she
was
not
insensible
to
the
pride
of
having
attracted
one
so
far
above
herself
in
station
;
not
insensible
to
the
secret
pleasure
of
knowing
that
he
,
whom
so
many
admired
,
had
often
said
he
would
give
anything
for
one
of
her
sweet
smiles
.
 
<EOS>
Her
love
for
him
was
a
bubble
,
blown
out
of
vanity
;
but
it
looked
very
real
and
very
bright
.
 
<EOS>
Sally
Leadbitter
,
meanwhile
,
keenly
observed
the
signs
of
the
times
;
she
found
out
that
Mary
had
begun
to
affix
a
stern
value
to
money
as
the
"
Purchaser
of
Life
,
"
and
many
girls
had
been
dazzled
and
lured
by
gold
,
even
without
the
betraying
love
which
she
believed
to
exist
in
Mary
's
heart
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
urged
young
Mr.
Carson
,
by
representations
of
the
want
she
was
sure
surrounded
Mary
,
to
bring
matters
more
to
a
point
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
a
kind
of
instinctive
dread
of
hurting
Mary
's
pride
of
spirit
,
and
durst
not
hint
his
knowledge
in
any
way
of
the
distress
that
many
must
be
enduring
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
that
for
the
present
he
must
still
be
content
with
stolen
meetings
and
summer
evening
strolls
,
and
the
delight
of
pouring
sweet
honeyed
words
into
her
ear
,
while
she
listened
with
a
blush
and
a
smile
that
made
her
look
radiant
with
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
No
;
he
would
be
cautious
in
order
to
be
certain
;
for
Mary
,
one
way
or
another
,
he
must
make
his
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
doubt
of
the
effect
of
his
own
personal
charms
in
the
long
run
;
for
he
knew
he
was
handsome
,
and
believed
himself
fascinating
.
  
<EOS>
If
he
had
known
what
Mary
's
home
was
,
he
would
not
have
been
so
much
convinced
of
his
increasing
influence
over
her
,
by
her
being
more
and
more
ready
to
linger
with
him
in
the
sweet
summer
air
.
 
<EOS>
For
when
she
returned
for
the
night
her
father
was
often
out
,
and
the
house
wanted
the
cheerful
look
it
had
had
in
the
days
when
money
was
never
wanted
to
purchase
soap
and
brushes
,
black
-
lead
and
pipe
-
clay
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
dingy
and
comfortless
;
for
,
of
course
,
there
was
not
even
the
dumb
familiar
home
-
friend
,
a
fire
.
 
<EOS>
And
Margaret
,
too
,
was
now
very
often
from
home
,
singing
at
some
of
those
grand
places
.
 
<EOS>
And
Alice
<EOS>
;
oh
,
Mary
wished
she
had
never
left
her
cellar
to
go
and
live
at
Ancoats
with
her
sister
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
For
in
that
matter
Mary
felt
very
guilty
;
she
had
put
off
and
put
off
going
to
see
the
widow
,
after
George
Wilson
's
death
,
from
dread
of
meeting
Jem
,
or
giving
him
reason
to
think
she
wished
to
be
as
intimate
with
him
as
formerly
;
and
now
she
was
so
much
ashamed
of
her
delay
that
she
was
likely
never
to
go
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
If
her
father
was
at
home
it
was
no
better
;
indeed
,
it
was
worse
.
<EOS>
He
seldom
spoke
,
less
than
ever
;
and
often
when
he
did
speak
,
they
were
sharp
angry
words
,
such
as
he
had
never
given
her
formerly
.
<EOS>
Her
temper
was
high
,
too
,
and
her
answers
not
over
mild
;
and
once
in
his
passion
he
had
even
beaten
her
.
 
<EOS>
If
Sally
Leadbitter
or
Mr.
Carson
had
been
at
hand
at
that
moment
,
Mary
would
have
been
ready
to
leave
home
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
alone
,
after
her
father
had
flung
out
of
the
house
,
bitterly
thinking
on
the
days
that
were
gone
;
angry
with
her
own
hastiness
,
and
believing
that
her
father
did
not
love
her
;
striving
to
heap
up
one
painful
thought
on
another
.
 
<EOS>
Who
cared
for
her
?
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
might
,
but
in
this
grief
that
seemed
no
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
Mother
dead
!
 
<EOS>
Father
so
often
angry
,
so
lately
cruel
(
for
it
was
a
hard
blow
,
and
blistered
and
reddened
Mary
's
soft
white
skin
with
pain
)
:
<EOS>
and
then
her
heart
turned
round
,
and
she
remembered
with
self
-
reproach
how
provokingly
she
had
looked
and
spoken
,
and
how
much
her
father
had
to
bear
;
and
oh
,
what
a
kind
and
loving
parent
he
had
been
,
till
these
days
of
trial
.
 
<EOS>
The
remembrance
of
one
little
instance
of
his
fatherly
love
thronged
after
another
into
her
mind
,
and
she
began
to
wonder
how
she
could
have
behaved
to
him
as
she
had
done
.
  
<EOS>
Then
he
came
home
;
and
but
for
very
shame
she
would
have
confessed
her
penitence
in
words
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
looked
sullen
,
from
her
effort
to
keep
down
emotion
;
and
for
some
time
her
father
did
not
know
how
to
begin
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
gulped
down
pride
,
and
said
   
"
<EOS>
Mary
,
I
'm
not
above
saying
I
'm
very
sorry
<EOS>
I
beat
thee
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
wert
a
bit
aggravating
,
and
I
'm
not
the
man
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
were
wrong
,
and
I
'll
try
never
to
lay
hands
on
thee
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
he
held
out
his
arms
,
and
in
many
tears
she
told
him
her
repentance
for
her
fault
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
struck
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
he
often
was
angry
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
was
almost
better
than
being
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
sat
near
the
fireplace
(
from
habit
)
smoking
,
or
chewing
opium
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
Mary
loathed
that
smell
!
 
<EOS>
And
in
the
dusk
,
just
before
it
merged
into
the
short
summer
night
,
she
had
learned
to
look
with
dread
towards
the
window
,
which
now
her
father
would
have
kept
uncurtained
:
for
there
were
not
seldom
seen
sights
which
haunted
her
in
her
dreams
.
 
<EOS>
Strange
faces
of
pale
men
,
with
dark
glaring
eyes
,
peered
into
the
inner
darkness
,
and
seemed
desirous
to
ascertain
if
her
father
was
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
Or
,
a
hand
and
arm
<EOS>
(
the
body
hidden
)
was
put
within
the
door
,
and
beckoned
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
went
.
 
<EOS>
And
once
or
twice
,
when
Mary
was
in
bed
,
she
heard
men
's
voices
below
,
in
earnest
,
whispered
talk
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
all
desperate
members
of
Trades
'
Unions
,
ready
for
anything
;
made
ready
by
want
.
  
<EOS>
While
all
this
change
for
gloom
yet
struck
fresh
and
heavy
on
Mary
's
heart
,
her
father
startled
her
out
of
a
reverie
one
evening
,
by
asking
her
when
she
had
been
to
see
Jane
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
From
his
manner
of
speaking
,
she
was
made
aware
that
he
had
been
;
but
at
the
time
of
his
visit
he
had
never
mentioned
anything
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
he
gruffly
told
her
to
go
next
day
without
fail
,
and
added
some
abuse
of
her
for
not
having
been
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
outward
impulse
of
her
father
's
speech
gave
Mary
the
push
which
she
in
this
instance
required
;
and
accordingly
,
timing
her
visit
so
as
to
avoid
Jem
's
hours
at
home
,
she
went
the
following
afternoon
to
Ancoats
.
  
<EOS>
The
outside
of
the
well
-
known
house
struck
her
as
different
;
for
the
door
was
closed
,
instead
of
open
,
as
it
once
had
always
stood
.
 
<EOS>
The
window
-
plants
,
George
Wilson
's
pride
and
especial
care
,
looked
withering
and
drooping
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
been
without
water
for
a
long
time
,
and
now
,
when
the
widow
had
reproached
herself
severely
for
neglect
,
in
her
ignorant
anxiety
she
gave
them
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
On
opening
the
door
,
Alice
was
seen
,
not
stirring
about
in
her
habitual
way
,
but
knitting
by
the
fireside
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
felt
hot
,
although
the
fire
burnt
grey
and
dim
,
under
the
bright
rays
of
the
afternoon
sun
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilson
was
"
siding
"
*
<EOS>
the
dinner
things
,
and
talking
all
the
time
,
in
a
kind
of
whining
,
shouting
voice
,
which
Mary
did
not
at
first
understand
.
 
<EOS>
She
understood
,
at
once
,
however
,
that
her
absence
had
been
noted
,
and
talked
over
;
she
saw
a
constrained
look
on
Mrs.
Wilson
's
sorrow
-
stricken
face
,
which
told
her
a
scolding
was
to
come
.
     
<EOS>
"
Dear
!
 
<EOS>
Mary
,
is
that
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
began
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
who
would
ha
'
dreamt
of
seeing
you
!
 
<EOS>
We
thought
you
'd
clean
forgotten
us
;
and
Jem
has
often
wondered
if
he
should
know
you
,
if
he
met
you
in
the
street
.
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
poor
Jane
Wilson
had
been
sorely
tried
;
and
at
present
her
trials
had
had
no
outward
effect
,
but
that
of
increased
acerbity
of
temper
.
 
<EOS>
She
wished
to
show
Mary
how
much
she
was
offended
,
and
meant
to
strengthen
her
cause
,
by
putting
some
of
her
own
sharp
speeches
into
Jem
's
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
felt
guilty
,
and
had
no
good
reason
to
give
as
an
apology
;
so
for
a
minute
she
stood
silent
,
looking
very
much
ashamed
,
and
then
turned
to
speak
to
Aunt
Alice
,
who
,
in
her
surprised
,
hearty
greeting
to
Mary
,
had
dropped
her
ball
of
worsted
,
and
was
busy
,
trying
to
set
the
thread
to
rights
,
before
the
kitten
had
entangled
it
past
redemption
,
once
round
every
chair
,
and
twice
round
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
mun
speak
louder
than
that
,
if
you
mean
her
to
hear
;
she
's
become
as
deaf
as
a
post
this
last
few
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
ha
'
told
you
,
if
I
'd
remembered
how
long
it
were
sin
'
you
'd
seen
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
I
'm
getting
very
hard
o
'
hearing
of
late
,
"
said
Alice
,
catching
the
state
of
the
case
,
with
her
quick
glancing
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
's
the
beginning
of
the
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
o
'
that
way
,
"
screamed
her
sister
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
've
had
enow
of
ends
and
deaths
without
forecasting
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
covered
her
face
with
her
apron
,
and
sat
down
to
cry
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
such
a
good
husband
,
"
said
she
,
in
a
less
excited
tone
,
to
Mary
,
as
she
looked
up
with
tear
-
streaming
eyes
from
behind
her
apron
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
one
can
tell
what
I
've
lost
in
him
,
for
no
one
knew
his
worth
like
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
's
listening
sympathy
softened
her
,
and
she
went
on
to
unburden
her
heavy
-
laden
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
dear
,
dear
!
 
<EOS>
No
one
knows
what
I
've
lost
.
 
<EOS>
When
my
poor
boys
went
,
I
thought
the
Almighty
had
crushed
me
to
th
'
ground
,
but
I
never
thought
o
'
losing
George
;
I
did
na
think
I
could
ha
'
borne
to
ha
'
lived
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
I
'm
here
,
and
he
's
"
 
A
 
fresh
burst
of
crying
interrupted
her
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
"
 
beginning
to
speak
again
,
 
"
did
you
ever
hear
what
a
poor
creature
I
were
when
he
married
me
?
 
<EOS>
And
he
such
a
handsome
fellow
!
<EOS>
Jem
's
nothing
to
what
his
father
were
at
his
age
.
"
  
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
Mary
had
heard
,
and
so
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
poor
woman
's
thoughts
had
gone
back
to
those
days
,
and
her
little
recollections
came
out
,
with
many
interruptions
of
sighs
,
and
tears
,
and
shakes
of
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
were
nought
about
me
for
him
to
choose
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
were
just
well
enough
afore
that
accident
,
but
at
after
I
were
downright
plain
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
Bessy
Witter
as
would
ha
'
given
her
eyes
for
him
;
she
as
is
Mrs.
Carson
now
,
for
she
were
a
handsome
lass
,
although
I
never
could
see
her
beauty
then
;
and
Carson
warn't
<EOS>
so
much
above
her
,
as
they
're
both
above
us
all
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
went
very
red
,
and
wished
she
could
help
doing
so
,
and
wished
also
that
Mrs.
Wilson
would
tell
her
more
about
the
father
and
mother
of
her
lover
;
but
she
durst
not
ask
,
and
Mrs.
Wilson
's
thoughts
soon
returned
to
her
husband
,
and
their
early
married
days
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
believe
me
,
Mary
,
there
never
was
such
a
born
goose
at
housekeeping
as
I
were
;
and
yet
he
married
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
had
been
in
a
factory
sin
'
five
years
old
a'most
,
and
I
knew
nought
about
cleaning
,
or
cooking
,
let
alone
washing
and
such
like
work
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
after
we
were
married
,
he
went
to
his
work
at
after
breakfast
,
and
says
he
,
"
Jenny
,
we
'll
ha
'
th
'
cold
beef
,
and
potatoes
,
and
that
's
a
dinner
for
a
prince
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
were
anxious
to
make
him
comfortable
,
God
knows
how
anxious
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
I
'd
no
notion
how
to
cook
a
potato
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
know'd
<EOS>
they
were
boiled
,
and
know'd
their
skins
were
taken
off
,
and
that
were
all
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
tidied
my
house
in
a
rough
kind
o
'
way
,
then
I
looked
at
that
very
clock
up
yonder
,
"
 
pointing
at
one
that
hung
against
the
wall
 
"
and
I
seed
it
were
nine
o'clock
,
so
<EOS>
,
thinks
I
,
th
'
potatoes
shall
be
well
boiled
at
any
rate
,
and
I
gets
'em
on
th
'
fire
in
a
jiffy
(
that
's
to
say
,
as
soon
as
I
could
peel
'em
,
which
were
a
tough
job
at
first
)
,
and
then
I
fell
to
unpacking
my
boxes
!
<EOS>
and
at
twenty
minutes
past
twelve
,
he
comes
home
,
and
I
had
the
beef
ready
on
th
'
table
,
and
I
went
to
take
the
potatoes
out
o
'
th
'
pot
;
<EOS>
but
oh
!
<EOS>
Mary
,
th
'
water
had
boiled
away
,
and
they
were
all
a
nasty
brown
mess
,
as
smelt
through
all
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
nought
,
and
were
very
gentle
;
but
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Mary
,
I
cried
so
that
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
ne'er
forget
it
;
no
,
never
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
many
a
blunder
at
after
,
but
none
that
fretted
me
like
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Father
does
not
like
girls
to
work
in
factories
,
"
said
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
know
he
does
not
;
and
reason
good
.
 
<EOS>
They
ought
n't
to
go
at
after
they
're
married
,
that
I
'm
very
clear
about
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
reckon
up
,
"
 
counting
with
her
finger
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
nine
men
,
I
know
,
as
has
been
driven
to
th
'
public
-
house
by
having
wives
as
worked
in
factories
;
good
folk
,
too
,
as
thought
there
was
no
harm
in
putting
their
little
ones
out
to
nurse
,
and
letting
their
house
go
all
dirty
,
and
their
fires
all
out
;
and
that
was
a
place
as
was
tempting
for
a
husband
to
stay
in
,
was
it
?
 
<EOS>
He
soon
finds
out
gin
-
shops
,
where
all
is
clean
and
bright
,
and
where
th
'
fire
blazes
cheerily
,
and
gives
a
man
a
welcome
as
it
were
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
,
who
was
standing
near
for
the
convenience
of
hearing
,
had
caught
much
of
this
speech
,
and
it
was
evident
<EOS>
the
subject
had
previously
been
discussed
by
the
women
,
for
she
chimed
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
our
Jem
could
speak
a
word
to
th
'
Queen
,
about
factory
work
for
married
women
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
!
<EOS>
but
he
comes
it
strong
when
once
yo
get
him
to
speak
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Wife
o
'
his'n
will
never
work
away
fra
'
home

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
it
's
Prince
Albert
<EOS>
as
ought
to
be
asked
how
he
'd
like
his
missis
to
be
from
home
when
he
comes
in
,
tired
and
worn
,
and
wanting
some
one
to
cheer
him
;
and
maybe
,
her
to
come
in
by
-
and
-
bye
,
just
as
tired
and
down
in
th
'
mouth
;
and
how
he
'd
like
for
her
never
to
be
at
home
to
see
to
th
'
cleaning
of
his
house
,
or
to
keep
a
bright
fire
in
his
grate
.
 
<EOS>
Let
alone
his
meals
being
all
hugger
-
mugger
and
comfortless
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
be
bound
,
prince
as
he
is
,
if
his
missis
served
him
so
,
he
'd
be
off
to
a
gin
-
palace
,
or
summut
o
'
<EOS>
that
kind
.
 
<EOS>
So
why
ca
n't
he
make
a
law
again
poor
folks
'
wives
working
in
factories
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
ventured
to
say
that
she
thought
the
Queen
and
Prince
Albert
could
not
make
laws
,
but
the
answer
was
   
"
Pooh
!
<EOS>
do
n't
tell
me
it
's
not
the
Queen
as
makes
laws
;
and
is
n't
she
bound
to
obey
Prince
Albert
?
 
<EOS>
And
if
he
said
they
must
n't
,
why
she
'd
say
they
must
n't
,
and
then
all
folk
would
say
,
oh
,
no
,
we
never
shall
do
any
such
thing
no
more
.

"
Jem
's
getten
on
rarely

"
said
Alice
,
who
had
not
heard
her
sister
's
last
burst
of
eloquence
,
and
whose
thoughts
were
still
running
on
her
nephew
,
and
his
various
talents
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
found
out
summut
about
a
crank
or
tank
<EOS>
,
I
forget
rightly
which
it
is
,
but
th
'
master
's
made
him
foreman
,
and
he
<EOS>
all
the
while
turning
off
hands
;
but
he
said
he
could
na
part
wi
'
Jem
,
nohow
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
good
wage
now
;
I
tell
him
he
'll
be
thinking
of
marrying
soon
,
and
he
deserves
a
right
down
good
wife
,
that
he
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
went
very
red
,
and
looked
annoyed
,
although
there
was
a
secret
spring
of
joy
deep
down
in
her
heart
,
at
hearing
Jem
so
spoken
of
.
<EOS>
But
his
mother
only
saw
the
annoyed
look
,
and
was
piqued
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
not
over
and
above
desirous
that
her
son
should
marry
.
 
<EOS>
His
presence
in
the
house
seemed
a
relic
of
happier
times
,
and
she
had
some
little
jealousy
of
his
future
wife
,
whoever
she
might
be
.
 
<EOS>
Still
she
could
not
bear
any
one
not
to
feel
gratified
and
flattered
by
Jem
's
preference
,
and
<EOS>
full
well
she
knew
how
above
all
others
he
preferred
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
Now
she
had
never
thought
Mary
good
enough
for
Jem
,
and
her
late
neglect
in
coming
to
see
her
still
rankled
a
little
in
her
breast
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
determined
to
invent
a
little
,
in
order
to
do
away
with
any
idea
Mary
might
have
that
Jem
would
choose
her
for
"
his
right
down
good
wife
,
"
as
Aunt
Alice
called
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
he
'll
be
for
taking
a
wife
soon
,
"
and
then
,
in
a
lower
voice
,
as
if
confidentially
,
but
really
to
prevent
any
contradiction
or
explanation
from
her
simple
sister
-
in
-
law
,
she
added
   
<EOS>
"
It
'll
not
be
long
afore
Molly
Gibson
(
that
's
her
at
th
<EOS>
'
provision
shop
round
the
corner
)
will
hear
a
secret
as
will
not
displease
her
,
I
'm
thinking
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
been
casting
sheep
's
eyes
at
our
Jem
this
many
a
day
,
but
he
thought
her
father
would
not
give
her
to
a
common
working
-
man
;
but
now
he
's
good
as
her
,
every
bit
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
once
he
'd
a
fancy
for
thee
,
Mary
,
but
I
donnot
think
yo'd
ever
ha
'
suited
,
so
it
's
best
as
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
By
an
effort
Mary
managed
to
keep
down
her
vexation
,
and
to
say
,
"
She
hoped
he
'd
be
happy
with
Molly
Gibson
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
very
handsome
,
for
certain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
and
a
notable
body
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
just
step
upstairs
and
show
you
the
patchwork
quilt
she
gave
me
but
last
Saturday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
was
glad
she
was
going
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Her
words
irritated
her
;
perhaps
not
the
less
because
she
did
not
fully
believe
them
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
she
wanted
to
speak
to
Alice
,
and
Mrs.
Wilson
seemed
to
think
that
she
,
as
the
widow
,
ought
to
absorb
all
the
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Alice
,
"
began
Mary
,
"
I
'm
so
grieved
to
find
you
so
deaf
;
it
must
have
come
on
very
rapid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dear
,
it
's
a
trial
;
I
'll
not
deny
it
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
God
give
me
strength
to
find
out
its
teaching
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
it
sore
one
fine
day
when
I
thought
I
'd
go
gather
some
meadow
-
sweet
to
make
tea
for
Jane
's
cough
;
and
the
fields
seemed
so
dree
and
still
,
and
at
first
I
could
na
make
out
what
was
wanting
;
and
then
it
struck
me
it
were
th
'
song
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
the
birds
,
and
that
I
never
should
hear
their
sweet
music
no
more
,
and
I
could
na
help
crying
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
've
much
to
be
thankful
for
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
'm
a
comfort
to
Jane
,
if
I
'm
only
some
one
to
scold
now
and
then
;
poor
body
!
 
<EOS>
It
takes
off
her
thoughts
from
her
sore
losses
when
she
can
scold
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
If
my
eyes
are
left
I
can
do
well
enough
;
I
can
guess
at
what
folk
are
saying
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
splendid
red
and
yellow
patch
quilt
now
made
its
appearance
,
and
Jane
Wilson
would
not
be
satisfied
unless
Mary
praised
it
all
over
,
border
,
centre
,
and
ground
-
work
,
right
side
and
wrong
;
and
Mary
did
her
duty
,
saying
all
the
more
,
because
she
could
not
work
herself
up
to
any
very
hearty
admiration
of
her
rival
's
present
.
 
<EOS>
She
made
haste
,
however
,
with
her
commendations
,
in
order
to
avoid
encountering
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
was
fairly
away
from
the
house
and
street
,
she
slackened
her
pace
,
and
began
to
think
.
 
<EOS>
Did
Jem
really
care
for
Molly
Gibson
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
if
he
did
,
let
him
.
 
<EOS>
People
seemed
all
to
think
he
was
much
too
good
for
her
<EOS>
(
Mary
's
own
self
)
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
some
one
else
,
far
more
handsome
,
and
far
more
grand
,
would
show
him
one
day
that
she
was
good
enough
to
be
Mrs.
Henry
Carson
.
 
<EOS>
So
temper
,
or
what
Mary
called
"
spirit
,
"
led
her
to
encourage
Mr.
Carson
more
than
ever
she
had
done
before
.
  
<EOS>
Some
weeks
after
this
there
was
a
meeting
of
the
Trades
'
Union
to
which
John
Barton
belonged
.
 
<EOS>
The
morning
of
the
day
on
which
it
was
to
take
place
he
had
lain
late
in
bed
,
for
what
was
the
use
of
getting
up
?
 
<EOS>
He
had
hesitated
between
the
purchase
of
meal
or
opium
,
and
had
chosen
the
latter
,
for
its
use
had
become
a
necessity
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
wanted
it
to
relieve
him
from
the
terrible
depression
its
absence
occasioned
.
 
<EOS>
A
large
lump
seemed
only
to
bring
him
into
a
natural
state
,
or
what
had
been
his
natural
state
formerly
.
 
<EOS>
Eight
o'clock
was
the
hour
fixed
for
the
meeting
;
and
at
it
were
read
letters
,
filled
with
details
of
woe
,
from
all
parts
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
Fierce
,
heavy
gloom
brooded
over
the
assembly
;
and
fiercely
and
heavily
did
the
men
separate
,
towards
eleven
o'clock
,
some
irritated
by
the
opposition
of
others
to
their
desperate
plans
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
night
to
cheer
them
,
as
they
quitted
the
glare
of
the
gas
-
lighted
room
,
and
came
out
into
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
Unceasing
,
soaking
rain
was
falling
;
the
very
lamps
seemed
obscured
by
the
damp
upon
the
glass
,
and
their
light
reached
but
to
a
little
distance
from
the
posts
.
 
<EOS>
The
streets
were
cleared
of
passers
-
by
;
not
a
creature
seemed
stirring
,
except
here
and
there
a
drenched
policeman
in
his
oilskin
cape
.
 
<EOS>
Barton
wished
the
others
good
-
night
,
and
set
off
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
gone
through
a
street
or
two
,
when
he
heard
a
step
behind
him
;
but
he
did
not
care
to
stop
and
see
who
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
further
,
and
the
person
quickened
step
,
and
touched
his
arm
very
lightly
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
,
and
saw
,
even
by
the
darkness
visible
of
that
badly
-
lighted
street
,
that
the
woman
who
stood
by
him
was
of
no
doubtful
profession
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
told
by
her
faded
finery
,
all
unfit
to
meet
the
pelting
of
that
pitiless
storm
;
the
gauze
bonnet
,
once
pink
,
now
dirty
white
;
the
muslin
gown
,
all
draggled
,
and
soaking
wet
up
to
the
very
knees
;
the
gay
-
coloured
barege
shawl
,
closely
wrapped
round
the
form
,
which
yet
shivered
and
shook
,
as
the
woman
whispered
,
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
swore
an
oath
,
and
bade
her
begone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
send
me
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
so
out
of
breath
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
say
what
I
would
all
at
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
put
her
hand
to
her
side
,
and
caught
her
breath
with
evident
pain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
thee
<EOS>
I
'm
not
the
man
for
thee
,
"
adding
an
opprobrious
name
.
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
"
said
he
,
as
a
thought
suggested
by
her
voice
flashed
across
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
gripped
her
arm
 
<EOS>
the
arm
he
had
just
before
shaken
off
 
and
dragged
her
,
faintly
resisting
,
to
the
nearest
lamp
-
post
.
 
<EOS>
He
pushed
the
bonnet
back
,
and
roughly
held
the
face
she
would
fain
have
averted
,
to
the
light
,
and
in
her
large
,
unnaturally
bright
grey
eyes
,
her
lovely
mouth
,
half
open
,
as
if
imploring
the
forbearance
she
could
not
ask
for
in
words
,
he
saw
at
once
the
long
-
lost
Esther
;
she
who
had
caused
his
wife
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
Much
was
like
the
gay
creature
of
former
years
;
but
the
glaring
paint
,
the
sharp
features
,
the
changed
expression
of
the
whole
!
 
<EOS>
But
most
of
all
,
he
loathed
the
dress
;
and
yet
the
poor
thing
,
out
of
her
little
choice
of
attire
,
had
put
on
the
plainest
she
had
,
to
come
on
that
night
's
errand
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
it
's
thee
,
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
thee
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
John
,
as
he
ground
his
teeth
,
and
shook
her
with
passion
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
looked
for
thee
long
at
corners
o
'
streets
,
and
such
like
places
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
I
should
find
thee
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
Thee'll
maybe
bethink
thee
o
'
<EOS>
some
words
I
spoke
,
which
put
thee
up
at
th
'
time
;
summut
about
street
-
walkers
;
but
oh
no
!
<EOS>
thou
art
<EOS>
none
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
them
naughts
;
no
one
thinks
thou
art
,
who
sees
thy
fine
draggle
-
tailed
dress
,
and
thy
pretty
pink
cheeks
!
"
<EOS>
stopping
for
very
want
of
breath
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mercy
!
<EOS>
John
,
mercy
!
<EOS>
listen
to
me
for
Mary
's
sake
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
meant
his
daughter
,
but
the
name
only
fell
on
his
ear
as
belonging
to
his
wife
;
and
it
was
adding
fuel
to
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
In
vain
did
her
face
grow
deadly
pale
around
the
vivid
circle
of
paint
,
in
vain
did
she
gasp
for
mercy
,
 
he
burst
forth
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
thou
names
that
name
to
me
?
<EOS>
and
thou
thinks
the
thought
of
her
will
bring
thee
mercy
!
 
<EOS>
Dost
thou
know
it
was
thee
who
killed
her
,
as
sure
as
ever
<EOS>
Cain
killed
Abel
.
 
<EOS>
She
'd
loved
thee
as
her
own
,
and
she
trusted
thee
as
her
own
,
and
when
thou
wert
gone
<EOS>
she
never
held
head
up
again
,
but
died
in
less
than
a
three
week
;
and
at
her
judgment
-
day
she
'll
rise
,
and
point
to
thee
as
her
murderer
;
or
if
she
do
n't
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
flung
her
,
trembling
,
sinking
,
fainting
,
from
him
,
and
strode
away
.
 
<EOS>
She
fell
with
a
feeble
scream
against
the
lamp
-
post
,
and
lay
there
in
her
weakness
,
unable
to
rise
.
 
<EOS>
A
policeman
came
up
in
time
to
see
the
close
of
these
occurrences
,
and
concluding
from
Esther
's
unsteady
,
reeling
fall
,
that
she
was
tipsy
,
he
took
her
in
her
half
-
unconscious
state
to
the
lock
-
ups
for
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
superintendent
of
that
abode
of
vice
and
misery
was
roused
from
his
dozing
watch
through
the
dark
hours
,
by
half
-
delirious
wails
and
moanings
,
which
he
reported
as
arising
from
intoxication
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
listened
,
he
would
have
heard
these
words
,
repeated
in
various
forms
,
but
always
in
the
same
anxious
,
muttering
way
   
<EOS>
"
He
would
not
listen
to
me
;
what
can
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
listen
to
me
,
and
I
wanted
to
warn
him
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
shall
I
do
to
save
Mary
's
child
!
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
How
can
I
keep
her
from
being
such
a
one
as
I
am
;
such
a
wretched
,
loathsome
creature
!
 
<EOS>
She
was
listening
just
as
I
listened
,
and
loving
just
as
I
loved
,
and
the
end
will
be
just
like
my
end
.
 
<EOS>
How
shall
I
save
her
?
 
<EOS>
She
wo
n't
hearken
to
warning
,
or
heed
it
more
than
I
did
:
and
who
loves
her
well
enough
to
watch
over
her
as
she
should
be
watched
?
 
<EOS>
God
keep
her
from
harm
!
<EOS>
And
yet
I
wo
n't
pray
for
her
;
sinner
that
I
am
!
 
<EOS>
Can
my
prayers
be
heard
?
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
they
'll
only
do
harm
.
 
<EOS>
How
shall
I
save
her
?
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
listen
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
the
night
wore
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
morning
she
was
taken
up
to
the
New
Bailey
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
clear
case
of
disorderly
vagrancy
,
and
she
was
committed
to
prison
for
a
month
.
 
<EOS>
How
much
might
happen
in
that
time
!

<EOS>
Barton
returned
home
after
his
encounter
with
Esther
,
uneasy
 
and
dissatisfied
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
said
no
more
than
he
had
been
planning
to
say
for
years
,
in
case
she
was
ever
thrown
in
his
way
,
in
the
character
in
which
he
felt
certain
he
should
meet
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
believed
she
deserved
it
all
,
and
yet
he
now
wished
he
had
not
said
it
.
 
<EOS>
Her
look
,
as
she
asked
for
mercy
,
haunted
him
through
his
broken
and
disordered
sleep
;
her
form
,
as
he
last
saw
her
,
lying
prostrate
in
helplessness
,
would
not
be
banished
from
his
dreams
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
up
in
bed
to
try
and
dispel
the
vision
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
too
late
,
his
conscience
smote
him
with
harshness
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
all
very
well
<EOS>
,
he
thought
,
to
have
said
what
he
did
,
if
he
had
added
some
kind
words
,
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
He
wondered
if
his
dead
wife
was
conscious
of
that
night
's
occurrence
;
and
he
hoped
not
,
for
with
her
love
for
Esther
he
believed
it
would
embitter
heaven
to
have
seen
her
so
degraded
and
repulsed
.
 
<EOS>
For
he
now
recalled
her
humility
,
her
tacit
acknowledgment
of
her
lost
character
;
and
he
began
to
marvel
if
there
was
power
in
the
religion
he
had
often
heard
of
,
to
turn
her
from
her
ways
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
that
no
earthly
power
that
he
knew
of
could
do
it
,
but
there
glimmered
on
his
darkness
the
idea
that
religion
might
save
her
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
where
to
find
her
again
?
 
<EOS>
In
the
wilderness
of
a
large
town
,
where
to
meet
with
an
individual
of
so
little
value
or
note
to
any
?
  
<EOS>
And
evening
after
evening
he
paced
the
same
streets
in
which
he
had
heard
those
footsteps
following
him
,
peering
under
every
fantastic
,
discreditable
bonnet
,
in
the
hopes
of
once
more
meeting
Esther
,
and
addressing
her
in
a
far
different
manner
from
what
he
had
done
before
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
returned
,
night
after
night
,
disappointed
in
his
search
,
and
at
last
gave
it
up
in
despair
,
and
tried
to
recall
his
angry
feelings
towards
her
,
in
order
to
find
relief
from
his
present
self
-
reproach
.
  
<EOS>
He
often
looked
at
Mary
,
and
wished
she
were
not
so
like
her
aunt
,
for
the
very
bodily
likeness
seemed
to
suggest
the
possibility
of
a
similar
likeness
in
their
fate
;
and
then
this
idea
enraged
his
irritable
mind
,
and
he
became
suspicious
and
anxious
about
Mary
's
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
Now
hitherto
<EOS>
she
had
been
so
remarkably
free
from
all
control
,
and
almost
from
all
inquiry
concerning
her
actions
,
that
she
did
not
brook
this
change
in
her
father
's
behaviour
very
well
.
<EOS>
Just
when
she
was
yielding
more
than
ever
to
Mr.
Carson
's
desire
of
frequent
meetings
,
it
was
hard
to
be
so
questioned
concerning
her
hours
of
leaving
off
work
,
whether
she
had
come
straight
home
,
etc
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
tell
lies
;
though
she
could
conceal
much
if
she
were
not
questioned
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
took
refuge
in
obstinate
silence
,
alleging
as
a
reason
for
it
her
indignation
at
being
so
cross
-
examined
.
 
<EOS>
This
did
not
add
to
the
good
feeling
between
father
and
daughter
,
and
yet
they
dearly
loved
each
other
;
and
in
the
minds
of
each
,
one
principal
reason
for
maintaining
such
behaviour
as
displeased
the
other
,
was
the
believing
that
this
conduct
would
insure
that
person
's
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
now
began
to
wish
Mary
was
married
.
 
<EOS>
Then
this
terrible
superstitious
fear
suggested
by
her
likeness
to
Esther
would
be
done
away
with
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
that
he
could
not
resume
the
reins
he
had
once
slackened
.
 
<EOS>
But
with
a
husband
it
would
be
different
.
 
<EOS>
If
Jem
Wilson
would
but
marry
her
!
 
<EOS>
With
his
character
for
steadiness
and
talent
!
<EOS>
But
he
was
afraid
Mary
had
slighted
him
,
he
came
so
seldom
now
to
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
ask
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
what
's
come
o'er
thee
and
Jem
Wilson
?
 
<EOS>
You
were
great
friends
at
one
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
folk
say
he
is
going
to
be
married
to
Molly
Gibson
,
and
of
course
courting
takes
up
a
deal
o
'
time
,
"
answered
Mary
,
as
indifferently
as
she
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou'st
played
thy
cards
badly
,
then
,
"
replied
her
father
,
in
a
surly
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
one
time
he
were
desperate
fond
o
'
thee
,
or
I
'm
much
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
Much
fonder
of
thee
than
thou
deservedst
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
as
people
think
,
"
said
Mary
pertly
,
for
she
remembered
that
the
very
morning
before
she
had
met
Mr.
Carson
,
who
had
sighed
,
and
swore
,
and
protested
all
manner
of
tender
vows
that
she
was
the
loveliest
,
sweetest
,
best
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
she
had
seen
him
afterwards
riding
with
one
of
his
beautiful
sisters
,
had
he
not
evidently
pointed
her
out
as
in
some
way
or
other
an
object
worthy
of
attention
and
interest
,
and
then
lingered
behind
his
sister
's
horse
for
a
moment
to
kiss
his
hand
repeatedly
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
as
for
Jem
Wilson
,
she
could
whistle
him
down
the
wind
.
  
<EOS>
But
her
father
was
not
in
the
mood
to
put
up
with
pertness
,
and
he
upbraided
her
with
the
loss
of
Jem
Wilson
till
she
had
to
bite
her
lips
till
the
blood
came
,
in
order
to
keep
down
the
angry
words
that
would
rise
in
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
her
father
left
the
house
,
and
then
she
might
give
way
to
her
passionate
tears
.
  
<EOS>
It
so
happened
that
Jem
,
after
much
anxious
thought
,
had
determined
that
day
to
"
put
his
fortune
to
the
touch
,
to
win
or
lose
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
a
condition
to
maintain
a
wife
in
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
true
his
mother
and
aunt
must
form
part
of
the
household
:
but
such
is
not
an
uncommon
case
among
the
poor
,
and
if
there
were
the
advantages
of
previous
friendship
between
the
parties
,
it
was
not
,
he
thought
,
an
obstacle
to
matrimony
.
 
<EOS>
Both
mother
and
aunt
,
he
believed
,
would
welcome
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
oh
!
<EOS>
what
a
certainty
of
happiness
<EOS>
the
idea
of
that
welcome
implied
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
absent
and
abstracted
all
day
long
with
the
thought
of
the
coming
event
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
He
almost
smiled
at
himself
for
his
care
in
washing
and
dressing
in
preparation
for
his
visit
to
Mary
;
as
if
one
waistcoat
or
another
could
decide
his
fate
in
so
passionately
a
momentous
thing
.
 
<EOS>
He
believed
he
only
delayed
before
his
little
looking
-
glass
for
cowardice
,
for
absolute
fear
of
a
girl
.
<EOS>
He
would
try
not
to
think
so
much
about
the
affair
,
and
he
thought
the
more
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Jem
!
<EOS>
it
is
not
an
auspicious
moment
for
thee
!
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
"
said
Mary
,
as
some
one
knocked
at
the
door
,
while
she
sat
sadly
at
her
sewing
,
trying
to
earn
a
few
pence
by
working
over
hours
at
some
mourning
.
  
<EOS>
Jem
entered
,
looking
more
awkward
and
abashed
than
he
had
ever
done
before
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
here
was
Mary
all
alone
,
just
as
he
had
hoped
to
find
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
ask
him
to
take
a
chair
,
but
after
standing
a
minute
or
two
<EOS>
he
sat
down
near
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
your
father
at
home
,
Mary
?
"
said
he
,
by
way
of
making
an
opening
,
for
she
seemed
determined
to
keep
silence
,
and
went
on
stitching
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
's
gone
to
his
Union
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Another
silence
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
no
use
waiting
,
thought
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
The
subject
would
never
be
led
to
by
any
talk
he
could
think
of
in
his
anxious
,
fluttered
state
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
better
begin
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
!
"
said
he
,
and
the
unusual
tone
of
his
voice
made
her
look
up
for
an
instant
,
but
in
that
time
she
understood
from
his
countenance
what
was
coming
,
and
her
heart
beat
so
suddenly
and
violently
she
could
hardly
sit
still
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
one
thing
she
was
sure
of
;
nothing
he
could
say
should
make
her
have
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
show
them
all
WHO
would
be
glad
to
have
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
not
yet
calm
after
her
father
's
irritating
speeches
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
her
eyes
fell
veiled
before
that
passionate
look
fixed
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Mary
!
<EOS>
(
for
how
dear
you
are
,
I
can
not
rightly
tell
you
in
words
.
)
 
<EOS>
It
's
no
new
story
I
'm
going
to
speak
about
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
ha
'
seen
and
known
it
long
;
for
since
we
were
boy
and
girl
<EOS>
I
ha
'
loved
you
above
father
and
mother
and
all
;
and
all
I
've
thought
on
by
day
and
dreamt
on
by
night
has
been
something
in
which
you
've
had
a
share
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
no
way
of
keeping
you
for
long
,
and
I
scorned
to
try
and
tie
you
down
;
and
I
lived
in
terror
lest
some
one
else
should
take
you
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
,
Mary
,
I
'm
foreman
in
th
'
works
,
and
,
dear
Mary
!
<EOS>
listen
,
"
as
she
,
in
her
unbearable
agitation
,
stood
up
and
turned
away
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
rose
too
,
and
came
nearer
,
trying
to
take
hold
of
her
hand
;
but
this
she
would
not
allow
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
bracing
herself
up
to
refuse
him
,
for
once
and
for
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
Mary
,
I
've
a
home
to
offer
you
,
and
a
heart
as
true
as
ever
man
had
to
love
you
and
cherish
you
;
we
shall
never
be
rich
folk
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
;
but
if
a
loving
heart
and
a
strong
right
arm
can
shield
you
from
sorrow
,
or
from
want
,
mine
shall
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
speak
as
I
would
like
;
my
love
wo
n't
let
itself
be
put
in
words
.
<EOS>
But
,
oh
!
<EOS>
darling
,
say
you
'll
believe
me
,
and
that
you
'll
be
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
speak
at
once
;
her
words
would
not
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
they
say
silence
gives
consent
;
is
it
so
?
"
<EOS>
he
whispered
.
  
<EOS>
Now
or
never
the
effort
must
be
made
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
it
does
not
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Her
voice
was
calm
,
although
she
trembled
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
always
be
your
friend
,
Jem
,
but
I
can
never
be
your
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
my
wife
?
"
said
he
mournfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
O
Mary
,
think
awhile
!
<EOS>
you
can
not
be
my
friend
if
you
will
not
be
my
wife
.
 
<EOS>
At
least
,
I
can
never
be
content
to
be
only
your
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Do
think
awhile
!
 
<EOS>
If
you
say
No
,
you
will
make
me
hopeless
,
desperate
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
no
love
of
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
made
the
very
groundwork
of
all
that
people
call
good
in
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
I
shall
be
if
you
wo
n't
have
me
.
<EOS>
And
,
Mary
,
think
how
glad
your
father
would
be
!
 
<EOS>
It
may
sound
vain
,
but
he
's
told
me
more
than
once
how
much
he
should
like
to
see
us
<EOS>
two
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
intended
this
for
a
powerful
argument
,
but
in
Mary
's
present
mood
it
told
against
him
more
than
anything
;
for
it
suggested
the
false
and
foolish
idea
that
her
father
,
in
his
evident
anxiety
to
promote
her
marriage
with
Jem
,
had
been
speaking
to
him
on
the
subject
with
some
degree
of
solicitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
Jem
,
it
can
not
be
.
 
<EOS>
Once
for
all
,
I
will
never
marry
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
is
this
the
end
of
all
my
hopes
and
fears
?
<EOS>
the
end
of
my
life
,
I
may
say
,
for
<EOS>
it
is
the
end
of
all
worth
living
for
!
"
 
<EOS>
His
agitation
rose
and
carried
him
into
passion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
you
'll
hear
,
maybe
,
of
me
as
a
drunkard
,
and
maybe
as
a
thief
,
and
maybe
as
a
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
!
<EOS>
when
all
are
speaking
ill
of
me
,
you
will
have
no
right
to
blame
me
,
for
it
's
your
cruelty
that
will
have
made
me
what
I
feel
I
shall
become
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
even
say
you
'll
try
and
like
me
;
will
you
,
Mary
?
"
said
he
,
suddenly
changing
his
tone
from
threatening
despair
to
fond
,
passionate
entreaty
,
as
he
took
her
hand
and
held
it
forcibly
between
both
of
his
,
while
he
tried
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
averted
face
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
silent
,
but
it
was
from
deep
and
violent
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
to
wait
;
he
would
not
hope
,
to
be
dashed
away
again
;
he
rather
in
his
bitterness
of
heart
chose
the
certainty
of
despair
,
and
before
she
could
resolve
what
to
answer
,
he
flung
away
her
hand
and
rushed
out
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jem
!
Jem
!
"
<EOS>
cried
she
,
with
faint
and
choking
voice
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
too
late
;
he
left
street
after
street
behind
him
with
his
almost
winged
speed
,
as
he
sought
the
fields
,
where
he
might
give
way
unobserved
to
all
the
deep
despair
he
felt
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
scarcely
ten
minutes
since
he
had
entered
the
house
,
and
found
Mary
at
comparative
peace
,
and
now
she
lay
half
across
the
dresser
,
her
head
hidden
in
her
hands
,
and
every
part
of
her
body
shaking
with
the
violence
of
her
sobs
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
told
at
first
(
if
you
had
asked
her
,
and
she
could
have
commanded
voice
enough
to
answer
)
why
she
was
in
such
agonized
grief
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
too
sudden
for
her
to
analyse
,
or
think
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
only
felt
that
by
her
own
doing
her
life
would
be
hereafter
blank
and
dreary
.
 
<EOS>
By-
<EOS>
and
-
bye
her
sorrow
exhausted
her
body
by
its
power
,
and
she
seemed
to
have
no
strength
left
for
crying
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
down
;
and
now
thoughts
crowded
on
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
One
little
hour
ago
,
and
all
was
still
unsaid
,
and
she
had
her
fate
in
her
own
power
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
,
how
long
ago
had
she
determined
to
say
pretty
much
what
she
did
,
if
the
occasion
ever
offered
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
two
people
were
arguing
the
matter
;
that
mournful
desponding
communion
between
her
former
self
,
and
her
present
self
.
<EOS>
Herself
,
a
day
,
an
hour
ago
;
and
herself
now
.
 
<EOS>
For
we
have
every
one
of
us
felt
how
a
very
few
minutes
of
the
months
and
years
called
life
,
will
sometimes
suffice
to
place
all
time
past
and
future
in
an
entirely
new
light
;
will
make
us
see
the
vanity
or
the
criminality
of
the
bygone
,
and
so
change
the
aspect
of
the
coming
time
that
we
look
with
loathing
on
the
very
thing
we
have
most
desired
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
moments
may
change
our
character
for
life
,
by
giving
a
totally
different
direction
to
our
aims
and
energies
.
  
<EOS>
To
return
to
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
Her
plan
had
been
,
as
we
well
know
,
to
marry
Mr.
Carson
,
and
the
occurrence
an
hour
ago
was
only
a
preliminary
step
.
<EOS>
True
;
but
it
had
unveiled
her
heart
to
her
;
it
had
convinced
her
that
she
loved
Jem
above
all
persons
or
things
.
 
<EOS>
But
Jem
was
a
poor
mechanic
,
with
a
mother
and
aunt
to
keep
;
a
mother
,
too
,
who
had
shown
her
pretty
clearly
that
she
did
not
desire
her
for
a
daughter
-
in
-
law
:
while
Mr.
Carson
was
rich
,
and
prosperous
,
and
gay
,
and
(
she
believed
)
would
place
her
in
all
circumstances
of
ease
and
luxury
,
where
want
could
never
come
.
 
<EOS>
What
were
these
hollow
vanities
to
her
,
now
she
had
discovered
the
passionate
secret
of
her
soul
?
 
<EOS>
She
felt
as
if
she
almost
hated
Mr.
Carson
,
who
had
decoyed
her
with
his
baubles
.
 
<EOS>
She
now
saw
how
vain
,
how
nothing
to
her
,
would
be
all
gaieties
and
pomps
,
all
joys
and
pleasures
,
unless
she
might
share
them
with
Jem
;
yes
,
with
him
she
had
harshly
rejected
so
short
a
time
ago
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
were
poor
,
she
loved
him
all
the
better
.
<EOS>
If
his
mother
did
think
her
unworthy
of
him
,
what
was
it
but
the
truth
?
<EOS>
as
she
now
owned
with
bitter
penitence
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
hitherto
been
walking
in
grope
-
light
towards
a
precipice
;
but
in
the
clear
revelation
of
that
past
hour
she
saw
her
danger
,
and
turned
away
resolutely
and
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
That
was
some
comfort
<EOS>
:
I
mean
her
clear
perception
of
what
she
ought
not
to
do
;
of
what
no
luring
temptation
should
ever
again
induce
her
to
hearken
to
.
 
<EOS>
How
she
could
best
undo
the
wrong
she
had
done
to
Jem
and
herself
by
refusing
his
love
was
another
anxious
question
.
 
<EOS>
She
wearied
herself
by
proposing
plans
,
and
rejecting
them
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
roused
to
a
consciousness
of
time
by
hearing
the
neighbouring
church
clock
strike
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
<EOS>
she
knew
might
be
expected
home
any
minute
,
and
she
was
in
no
mood
for
a
meeting
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
hastily
gathered
up
her
work
,
and
went
to
her
own
little
bedroom
,
leaving
him
to
let
himself
in
.
  
<EOS>
She
put
out
her
candle
,
that
her
father
might
not
see
its
light
under
the
door
;
and
sat
down
on
her
bed
to
think
.
 
<EOS>
But
again
,
turning
things
over
in
her
mind
again
and
again
,
she
could
only
determine
at
once
to
put
an
end
to
all
further
communication
with
Mr.
Carson
,
in
the
most
decided
way
she
could
.
 
<EOS>
Maidenly
modesty
(
and
true
love
is
ever
modest
)
seemed
to
oppose
every
plan
she
could
think
of
,
for
showing
Jem
how
much
she
repented
her
decision
against
him
,
and
how
dearly
she
had
now
discovered
that
she
loved
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
came
to
the
unusual
wisdom
of
resolving
to
do
nothing
,
but
strive
to
be
patient
,
and
improve
circumstances
as
they
might
turn
up
.
<EOS>
Surely
,
if
Jem
knew
of
her
remaining
unmarried
,
he
would
try
his
fortune
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
never
be
content
with
one
rejection
;
she
believed
she
could
not
in
his
place
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
very
wrong
,
but
now
she
would
endeavour
to
do
right
,
and
have
womanly
patience
,
until
he
saw
her
changed
and
repentant
mind
in
her
natural
actions
.
<EOS>
Even
if
she
had
to
wait
for
years
,
it
was
no
more
than
now
<EOS>
it
was
easy
to
look
forward
to
,
as
a
penance
for
her
giddy
flirting
on
the
one
hand
,
and
her
cruel
mistake
concerning
her
feelings
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
So
anticipating
a
happy
ending
in
the
course
of
her
love
,
however
distant
it
might
be
,
she
fell
asleep
just
as
the
earliest
factory
bells
were
ringing
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
sunk
down
in
her
clothes
,
and
her
sleep
was
unrefreshing
.
 
<EOS>
She
wakened
up
shivery
and
chill
in
body
,
and
sorrow
-
stricken
in
mind
,
though
she
could
not
at
first
rightly
tell
the
cause
of
her
depression
.
  
<EOS>
She
recalled
the
events
of
the
night
before
,
and
still
resolved
to
adhere
to
the
determinations
she
had
then
formed
.
 
<EOS>
But
patience
seemed
a
far
more
difficult
virtue
this
morning
.
  
<EOS>
She
hastened
downstairs
,
and
in
her
earnest
,
sad
desire
to
do
right
,
now
took
much
pains
to
secure
a
comfortable
though
scanty
breakfast
for
her
father
;
and
when
he
dawdled
into
the
room
,
in
an
evidently
irritable
temper
,
she
bore
all
with
the
gentleness
of
penitence
,
till
at
last
her
mild
answers
turned
away
wrath
.
  
<EOS>
She
loathed
the
idea
of
meeting
Sally
Leadbitter
at
her
daily
work
;
yet
it
must
be
done
,
and
she
tried
to
nerve
herself
for
the
encounter
,
and
to
make
it
at
once
understood
,
that
having
determined
to
give
up
having
anything
further
to
do
with
Mr.
Carson
<EOS>
,
she
considered
the
bond
of
intimacy
broken
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
But
Sally
was
not
the
person
to
let
these
resolutions
be
carried
into
effect
too
easily
.
 
<EOS>
She
soon
became
aware
of
the
present
state
of
Mary
's
feelings
,
but
she
thought
they
merely
arose
from
the
changeableness
of
girlhood
,
and
that
the
time
would
come
when
Mary
would
thank
her
for
almost
forcing
her
to
keep
up
her
meetings
and
communications
with
her
rich
lover
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
when
two
days
had
passed
over
in
rather
too
marked
avoidance
of
Sally
on
Mary
's
part
,
and
when
the
former
was
made
aware
by
Mr.
Carson
's
complaints
that
Mary
was
not
keeping
her
appointments
with
him
,
and
that
unless
he
detained
her
by
force
,
he
had
no
chance
of
obtaining
a
word
as
she
passed
him
in
the
street
on
her
rapid
walk
home
,
she
resolved
to
compel
Mary
to
what
she
called
her
own
good
.
  
<EOS>
She
took
no
notice
during
the
third
day
of
Mary
's
avoidance
as
they
sat
at
work
;
she
rather
seemed
to
acquiesce
in
the
coolness
of
their
intercourse
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
away
her
sewing
early
,
and
went
home
to
her
mother
,
who
,
she
said
,
was
more
ailing
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
girls
soon
followed
her
example
,
and
Mary
,
casting
a
rapid
glance
up
and
down
the
street
,
as
she
stood
last
on
Miss
Simmonds
'
doorstep
,
darted
homewards
,
in
hopes
of
avoiding
the
person
whom
she
was
fast
learning
to
dread
.
 
<EOS>
That
night
she
was
safe
from
any
encounter
on
her
road
,
and
she
arrived
at
home
,
which
she
found
,
as
she
expected
,
empty
<EOS>
;
for
she
knew
it
was
a
club
night
,
which
her
father
would
not
miss
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
down
to
recover
breath
,
and
to
still
her
heart
,
which
panted
more
from
nervousness
than
from
over
-
exertion
,
although
she
had
walked
so
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
arose
,
and
taking
off
her
bonnet
<EOS>
,
her
eye
caught
the
form
of
Sally
Leadbitter
passing
the
window
with
a
lingering
step
,
and
looking
into
the
darkness
with
all
her
might
,
as
if
to
ascertain
if
Mary
were
returned
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
she
repassed
and
knocked
at
the
house
-
door
;
but
without
awaiting
an
answer
,
she
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mary
,
dear
"
(
knowing
well
how
little
<EOS>
"
dear
"
Mary
considered
her
just
then
)
;
"
it
's
so
difficult
to
get
any
comfortable
talk
at
Miss
Simmonds
'
<EOS>
,
I
thought
I
'd
just
step
up
and
see
you
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understood
,
from
what
you
said
,
your
mother
was
ailing
,
and
that
you
wanted
to
be
with
her
,
"
replied
Mary
,
in
no
welcoming
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
but
mother
's
better
now
,
"
said
the
unabashed
Sally
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
father
's
out
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
looking
round
as
well
as
she
could
;
for
Mary
made
no
haste
to
perform
the
hospitable
offices
of
striking
a
match
,
and
lighting
a
candle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
's
out
,
"
said
Mary
shortly
,
and
busying
herself
at
last
about
the
candle
,
without
ever
asking
her
visitor
to
sit
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
better
,
"
answered
Sally
;
"
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
Mary
,
I
've
a
friend
at
th
'
end
of
the
road
,
as
is
anxious
to
come
and
see
you
at
home
,
since
you
're
grown
so
particular
as
not
to
like
to
speak
to
him
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
He
'll
be
here
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
O
Sally
,
do
n't
let
him
,
"
said
Mary
,
speaking
at
last
heartily
;
and
running
to
the
door
,
she
would
have
fastened
it
,
but
Sally
held
her
hands
,
laughing
meanwhile
at
her
distress
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
please
,
Sally
,
"
struggling
,
"
dear
Sally
!
<EOS>
do
n't
let
him
come
here
,
the
neighbours
will
so
talk
,
and
father'll
go
mad
if
he
hears
;
he
'll
kill
me
,
Sally
<EOS>
,
he
will
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
do
n't
love
him
 
I
never
did
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
let
me
go
,
"
as
footsteps
approached
;
and
then
,
as
they
passed
the
house
,
and
seemed
to
give
her
a
respite
,
she
continued
,
"
Do
,
Sally
,
dear
Sally
,
go
and
tell
him
I
do
n't
love
him
,
and
that
I
do
n't
want
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
wrong
,
I
dare
say
,
keeping
company
with
him
at
all
,
but
I
'm
very
sorry
,
if
I
've
led
him
to
think
too
much
of
me
;
and
I
do
n't
want
him
to
think
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
tell
him
this
,
Sally
?
<EOS>
and
I
'll
do
anything
for
you
,
if
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
'll
do
,
"
said
Sally
,
in
a
more
relenting
mood
;
"
I
'll
go
back
with
you
to
where
he
's
waiting
for
us
;
or
rather
<EOS>
,
I
should
say
,
where
I
told
him
to
wait
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
till
I
seed
if
your
father
was
at
home
;
and
if
I
did
n't
come
back
in
that
time
,
he
said
he
'd
come
here
,
and
break
the
door
open
<EOS>
but
he
'd
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
let
us
go
,
let
us
go
,
"
said
Mary
,
feeling
that
the
interview
must
be
,
and
had
better
be
anywhere
than
at
home
,
where
her
father
might
return
at
any
minute
.
 
<EOS>
She
snatched
up
her
bonnet
,
and
was
at
the
end
of
the
court
in
an
instant
;
but
then
,
not
knowing
whether
to
turn
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
,
she
was
obliged
to
wait
for
Sally
,
who
came
leisurely
up
,
and
put
her
arm
through
Mary
's
with
a
kind
of
decided
hold
,
intended
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
her
changing
her
mind
and
turning
back
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
,
under
the
circumstances
,
was
quite
different
to
Mary
's
plan
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
wondered
more
than
once
if
she
must
not
have
another
interview
with
Mr.
Carson
;
and
had
then
determined
,
while
she
expressed
her
resolution
that
it
should
be
the
final
one
,
to
tell
him
how
sorry
she
was
if
she
had
thoughtlessly
given
him
false
hopes
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
be
it
remembered
,
she
had
the
innocence
,
or
the
ignorance
,
to
believe
his
intentions
honourable
;
and
<EOS>
he
,
feeling
that
at
any
price
he
must
have
her
,
only
that
he
would
obtain
her
as
cheaply
as
he
could
,
had
never
undeceived
her
;
while
Sally
Leadbitter
laughed
in
her
sleeve
at
them
both
,
and
wondered
how
it
would
all
end
 
whether
Mary
would
gain
her
point
of
marriage
,
with
her
sly
affectation
of
believing
such
to
be
Mr.
Carson
's
intention
in
courting
her
.
  
<EOS>
Not
very
far
from
the
end
of
the
street
,
into
which
the
court
where
Mary
lived
opened
,
they
met
Mr.
Carson
,
his
hat
a
good
deal
slouched
over
his
face
,
as
if
afraid
of
being
recognised
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
when
he
saw
them
coming
,
and
led
the
way
without
uttering
a
word
(
although
they
were
close
behind
)
to
a
street
of
half
-
finished
houses
.
  
<EOS>
The
length
of
the
walk
gave
Mary
time
to
recoil
from
the
interview
which
was
to
follow
;
but
even
if
her
own
resolve
to
go
through
with
it
had
failed
,
there
was
the
steady
grasp
of
Sally
Leadbitter
,
which
she
could
not
evade
without
an
absolute
struggle
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
he
stopped
in
the
shelter
and
concealment
of
a
wooden
fence
,
put
up
to
keep
the
building
rubbish
from
intruding
on
the
foot
-
pavement
.
<EOS>
Inside
this
fence
,
a
minute
afterwards
,
the
girls
were
standing
by
him
;
Mary
now
returning
Sally
's
detaining
grasp
with
interest
,
for
she
had
determined
on
the
way
to
make
her
a
witness
,
willing
or
unwilling
,
to
the
ensuing
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
But
Sally
's
curiosity
led
her
to
be
a
very
passive
prisoner
in
Mary
's
hold
.
  
<EOS>
With
more
freedom
than
he
had
ever
used
before
,
Mr.
Carson
put
his
arm
firmly
round
Mary
's
waist
,
in
spite
of
her
indignant
resistance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
!
<EOS>
you
little
witch
!
 
<EOS>
Now
I
have
caught
you
,
I
shall
keep
you
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
now
what
has
made
you
run
away
from
me
so
fast
<EOS>
these
few
days
 
tell
me
,
you
sweet
little
coquette
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
ceased
struggling
,
but
turned
so
as
to
be
almost
opposite
to
him
,
while
she
spoke
out
calmly
and
boldly
   
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Carson
!
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
you
for
once
and
for
all
.
 
<EOS>
Since
I
met
you
last
Monday
evening
,
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
've
been
wrong
in
leading
you
to
think
I
liked
you
;
but
I
believe
I
did
n't
rightly
know
my
own
mind
;
and
I
humbly
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
if
I
've
led
you
to
think
too
much
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
For
an
instant
he
was
surprised
;
the
next
,
vanity
came
to
his
aid
,
and
convinced
him
that
she
could
only
be
joking
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
young
,
agreeable
,
rich
,
handsome
!
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
she
was
only
showing
a
little
womanly
fondness
for
coquetting
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
darling
little
rascal
to
go
on
in
this
way
!
 
<EOS>
"
Humbly
begging
my
pardon
if
you
've
made
me
think
too
much
of
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
if
you
did
n't
know
I
think
of
you
from
morning
till
night
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
want
to
be
told
it
again
and
again
,
do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
sir
,
I
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
far
liefer
<EOS>
*
that
you
should
say
you
would
never
think
of
me
again
,
than
that
you
should
speak
of
me
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
indeed
,
sir
,
I
never
was
more
in
earnest
than
I
am
,
when
I
say
to
-
night
is
the
last
night
I
will
ever
speak
to
you
.
"
     
<EOS>
"
Last
night
,
you
sweet
little
equivocator
,
but
not
last
day
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
Mary
<EOS>
,
I
've
caught
you
,
have
I
?
"
<EOS>
as
she
,
puzzled
by
his
perseverance
in
thinking
her
joking
,
hesitated
in
what
form
she
could
now
put
her
meaning
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
sir
,
"
she
said
sharply
,
"
that
I
will
never
speak
to
you
again
,
at
any
time
,
after
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
's
made
this
change
,
Mary
?
"
said
he
,
seriously
enough
now
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
I
done
anything
to
offend
you
?
"
<EOS>
added
he
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
she
answered
gently
,
but
yet
firmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
you
exactly
why
I
've
changed
my
mind
;
but
I
shall
not
alter
it
again
;
and
,
as
I
said
before
,
I
beg
your
pardon
if
I
've
done
wrong
by
you
.
<EOS>
And
now
sir
,
if
you
please
,
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
not
please
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
not
go
.
 
<EOS>
What
have
I
done
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
go
without
telling
me
how
I
have
vexed
you
.
<EOS>
What
would
you
have
me
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nothing
,
sir
,
but
<EOS>
"
(
in
an
agitated
tone
)
,
"
oh
!
let
me
go
!
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
change
my
mind
;
it
's
quite
made
up
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
sir
!
<EOS>
why
do
you
hold
me
so
tight
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
WILL
know
why
I
wo
n't
have
anything
more
to
do
with
you
,
it
is
that
I
can
not
love
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
tried
,
and
I
really
can
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
naive
and
candid
avowal
served
her
but
little
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
understand
how
it
could
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
Some
reason
lurked
behind
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
passionately
in
love
.
 
<EOS>
What
should
he
do
to
tempt
her
?
 
<EOS>
A
thought
struck
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Listen
!
<EOS>
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
can
not
let
you
go
till
you
have
heard
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
love
you
dearly
;
and
I
wo
n't
believe
but
<EOS>
what
you
love
me
a
very
little
,
just
a
very
little
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
if
you
do
n't
like
to
own
it
,
never
mind
!
 
<EOS>
I
only
want
now
to
tell
you
how
much
I
love
you
,
by
what
I
am
ready
to
give
up
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
(
or
perhaps
you
are
not
fully
aware
)
<EOS>
how
little
my
father
and
mother
would
like
me
to
marry
you
.
 
<EOS>
So
angry
would
they
be
,
and
so
much
ridicule
<EOS>
should
I
have
to
brave
<EOS>
,
that
of
course
I
have
never
thought
of
it
till
now
.
<EOS>
I
thought
we
could
be
happy
enough
without
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
Deep
sank
those
words
into
Mary
's
heart
.
)
 
<EOS>
"
But
now
,
if
you
like
,
I
'll
get
a
licence
to
-
morrow
morning
 
nay
,
to
-
night
,
and
I
'll
marry
you
in
defiance
of
all
the
world
,
rather
than
give
you
up
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
year
or
two
my
father
will
forgive
me
,
and
meanwhile
you
shall
have
every
luxury
money
can
purchase
,
and
every
charm
that
love
can
devise
to
make
your
life
happy
.
 
<EOS>
After
all
,
my
mother
was
but
a
factory
girl
.
"
<EOS>
(
This
was
said
to
himself
,
as
if
to
reconcile
himself
to
this
bold
step
.
)
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mary
,
you
see
how
willing
I
am
to
 
to
sacrifice
a
good
deal
for
you
;
I
even
offer
you
marriage
,
to
satisfy
your
little
ambitious
heart
;
so
now
,
wo
n't
you
say
,
you
can
love
me
a
little
,
little
bit
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
pulled
her
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
To
his
surprise
,
she
still
resisted
.
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
though
all
she
had
pictured
to
herself
for
so
many
months
in
being
the
wife
of
Mr.
Carson
was
now
within
her
grasp
,
she
resisted
.
<EOS>
His
speech
had
given
her
but
one
feeling
,
that
of
exceeding
great
relief
.
 
<EOS>
For
she
had
dreaded
,
now
she
knew
what
true
love
was
,
to
think
of
the
attachment
she
might
have
created
;
the
deep
feeling
her
flirting
conduct
might
have
called
out
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
loaded
herself
with
reproaches
for
the
misery
she
might
have
caused
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
relief
to
gather
that
the
attachment
was
of
that
low
despicable
kind
which
can
plan
to
seduce
the
object
of
its
affection
;
that
the
feeling
she
had
caused
was
shallow
enough
,
for
it
only
pretended
to
embrace
self
,
at
the
expense
of
the
misery
,
the
ruin
,
of
one
falsely
termed
beloved
.
<EOS>
She
need
not
be
penitent
to
such
a
plotter
!
<EOS>
that
was
the
relief
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
obliged
to
you
,
sir
,
for
telling
me
what
you
have
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
think
I
am
a
fool
;
but
I
did
think
you
meant
to
marry
me
all
along
;
and
yet
,
thinking
so
<EOS>
,
I
felt
I
could
not
love
you
.
 
<EOS>
Still
I
felt
sorry
I
had
gone
so
far
in
keeping
company
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
sir
,
I
tell
you
,
if
I
had
loved
you
before
,
I
do
n't
think
I
should
have
loved
you
now
<EOS>
you
have
told
me
you
meant
to
ruin
me
;
for
that
's
the
plain
English
of
not
meaning
to
marry
me
till
just
this
minute
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
I
was
sorry
,
and
humbly
begged
your
pardon
;
that
was
before
I
knew
what
you
were
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
scorn
you
,
sir
,
for
plotting
to
ruin
a
poor
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Goodnight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
with
a
wrench
,
for
which
she
had
reserved
all
her
strength
,
she
flew
off
like
a
bolt
.
 
<EOS>
They
heard
her
flying
footsteps
echo
down
the
quiet
street
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
sound
was
Sally
's
laugh
,
which
grated
on
Mr.
Carson
's
ears
,
and
keenly
irritated
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
find
so
amusing
,
Sally
?
"
asked
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir
,
I
beg
your
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
I
humbly
beg
your
pardon
,
as
Mary
says
,
but
I
ca
n't
help
laughing
to
think
how
she
's
outwitted
us
.
"
<EOS>
(
She
was
going
to
have
said
,
"
outwitted
you
,
"
but
changed
the
pronoun
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Sally
,
had
you
any
idea
she
was
going
to
fly
out
in
this
style
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
had
n't
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
you
did
think
of
marrying
her
,
why
(
if
I
may
be
so
bold
as
to
ask
)
did
you
go
and
tell
her
you
had
no
thought
of
doing
otherwise
by
her
?
 
<EOS>
That
was
what
put
her
up
at
last
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
had
repeatedly
before
led
her
to
infer
that
marriage
was
not
my
object
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
dreamed
she
could
have
been
so
foolish
as
to
have
mistaken
me
,
little
provoking
romancer
though
she
be
!
 
<EOS>
So
I
naturally
wished
her
to
know
what
a
sacrifice
of
prejudice
,
of
 
of
myself
,
in
short
,
I
was
willing
to
make
for
her
sake
;
yet
I
do
n't
think
she
was
aware
of
it
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
might
have
any
lady
in
Manchester
if
I
liked
,
<EOS>
and
yet
I
was
willing
and
ready
to
marry
a
poor
dressmaker
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
understand
me
now
?
<EOS>
and
do
n't
you
see
what
a
sacrifice
<EOS>
I
was
making
to
humour
her
?
<EOS>
and
all
to
no
avail
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sally
was
silent
,
so
he
went
on
   
"
<EOS>
My
father
would
have
forgiven
any
temporary
connection
,
far
sooner
than
my
marrying
one
so
far
beneath
me
in
rank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
said
,
sir
,
your
mother
was
a
factory
girl
,
"
remarked
Sally
rather
maliciously
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
!
 
<EOS>
but
then
my
father
was
in
much
such
a
station
;
at
any
rate
,
there
was
not
the
disparity
there
is
between
Mary
and
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Another
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
mean
to
give
her
up
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
She
made
no
bones
of
saying
she
gave
you
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
do
not
mean
to
give
her
up
,
whatever
you
and
she
may
please
to
think
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
more
in
love
with
her
than
ever
;
even
for
this
charming
capricious
ebullition
of
hers
.
 
<EOS>
She
'll
come
round
<EOS>
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Women
always
do
.
 
<EOS>
They
always
have
second
thoughts
,
and
find
out
that
they
are
best
in
casting
off
a
lover
.
 
<EOS>
Mind
,
I
do
n't
say
I
shall
offer
her
the
same
terms
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
few
more
words
of
no
importance
,
the
allies
parted
.
   
<EOS>
OLD
ALICE
'S
<EOS>
BAIRN
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
lov'd
him
not
;
and
yet
now
he
is
gone
<EOS>
,
I
feel
I
am
alone
.
<EOS>
I
check'd
him
while
he
spoke
;
yet
could
he
speak
,
Alas
!
<EOS>
I
would
not
check
.
<EOS>
For
reasons
not
to
love
him
once
I
sought
,
And
wearied
all
my
thought
.
"
  
W.
S.
LANDOR
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
Mary
had
,
as
she
thought
,
dismissed
both
her
lovers
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
looked
on
their
dismissals
with
very
different
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
He
who
loved
her
with
all
his
heart
and
with
all
his
soul
,
considered
his
rejection
final
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
comfort
himself
with
the
idea
,
which
would
have
proved
so
well
founded
in
his
case
,
that
women
have
second
thoughts
about
casting
off
their
lovers
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
too
much
respect
for
his
own
heartiness
of
love
to
believe
himself
unworthy
of
Mary
;
that
mock
humble
conceit
did
not
enter
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
he
did
not
"
hit
Mary
's
fancy
"
;
and
though
that
may
sound
a
trivial
every
-
day
expression
,
yet
the
reality
of
it
cut
him
to
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Wild
visions
of
enlistment
,
of
drinking
himself
into
forgetfulness
,
of
becoming
desperate
in
some
way
or
another
,
entered
his
mind
;
but
then
the
thought
of
his
mother
stood
like
an
angel
with
a
drawn
sword
in
the
way
to
sin
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
you
know
,
"
he
was
the
only
son
of
his
mother
,
and
she
was
a
widow
"
;
dependent
on
him
for
daily
bread
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
could
not
squander
away
health
and
time
,
which
were
to
him
money
wherewith
to
support
her
failing
years
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
to
his
work
,
accordingly
,
to
all
outward
semblance
just
as
usual
;
but
with
a
heavy
,
heavy
heart
within
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
,
as
we
have
seen
,
persevered
in
considering
Mary
's
rejection
of
him
as
merely
a
"
charming
caprice
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
If
she
were
at
work
,
Sally
Leadbitter
was
sure
to
slip
a
passionately
loving
note
into
her
hand
,
and
then
so
skilfully
move
away
from
her
side
,
that
Mary
could
not
all
at
once
return
it
,
without
making
some
sensation
among
the
workwomen
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
even
forced
to
take
several
home
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
after
reading
one
,
she
determined
on
her
plan
.
 
<EOS>
She
made
no
great
resistance
to
receiving
them
from
Sally
,
but
kept
them
unopened
,
and
occasionally
returned
them
in
a
blank
half
-
sheet
of
paper
.
 
<EOS>
But
far
worse
than
this
<EOS>
,
was
the
being
so
constantly
waylaid
as
she
went
home
by
her
persevering
lover
;
who
had
been
so
long
acquainted
with
all
her
habits
,
that
she
found
it
difficult
to
evade
him
.
 
<EOS>
Late
or
early
,
she
was
never
certain
of
being
free
from
him
.
<EOS>
Go
this
way
or
that
,
he
might
come
up
some
cross
street
when
she
had
just
congratulated
herself
on
evading
him
for
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
taken
a
surer
mode
of
making
himself
odious
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
And
all
this
time
Jem
Wilson
never
came
!
 
<EOS>
Not
to
see
her
 
that
she
did
not
expect
 
but
to
see
her
father
;
to
 
she
did
not
know
what
,
but
she
had
hoped
he
would
have
come
on
some
excuse
,
just
to
see
if
she
had
n't
changed
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
came
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
grew
weary
and
impatient
,
and
her
spirits
sank
.
 
<EOS>
The
persecution
of
the
one
lover
,
and
the
neglect
of
the
other
,
oppressed
her
sorely
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
now
sit
quietly
through
the
evening
at
her
work
;
or
,
if
she
kept
,
by
a
strong
effort
,
from
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
,
she
felt
as
if
she
must
sing
to
keep
off
thought
while
she
sewed
.
 
<EOS>
And
her
songs
were
the
maddest
,
merriest
,
she
could
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
"
Barbara
Allen
,
"
and
such
sorrowful
ditties
,
did
well
enough
for
happy
times
;
but
now
she
required
all
the
aid
that
could
be
derived
from
external
excitement
to
keep
down
the
impulse
of
grief
.
  
<EOS>
And
her
father
,
too
 
he
was
a
great
anxiety
to
her
<EOS>
,
he
looked
so
changed
and
so
ill
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
he
would
not
acknowledge
to
any
ailment
.
<EOS>
She
knew
,
that
be
it
as
late
as
it
would
,
she
never
left
off
work
until
(
if
the
poor
servants
paid
her
pretty
regularly
for
the
odd
jobs
of
mending
she
did
for
them
)
<EOS>
she
had
earned
a
few
pence
,
enough
for
one
good
meal
for
her
father
on
the
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
But
very
frequently
all
she
could
do
in
the
morning
,
after
her
late
sitting
up
at
night
,
was
to
run
with
the
work
home
,
and
receive
the
money
from
the
person
for
whom
it
was
done
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
stay
often
to
make
purchases
of
food
,
but
gave
up
the
money
at
once
to
her
father
's
eager
clutch
;
sometimes
prompted
by
a
savage
hunger
it
is
true
,
but
more
frequently
by
a
craving
for
opium
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
whole
he
was
not
so
hungry
as
his
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
For
it
was
a
long
fast
from
the
one
o'clock
dinner
hour
at
Miss
Simmonds
'
to
the
close
of
Mary
's
vigil
,
which
was
often
extended
to
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
young
,
and
had
not
yet
learned
to
bear
"
clemming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
One
evening
,
as
she
sang
a
merry
song
over
her
work
,
stopping
occasionally
to
sigh
,
the
blind
Margaret
came
groping
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
one
of
Mary
's
additional
sorrows
that
her
friend
had
been
absent
from
home
,
accompanying
the
lecturer
on
music
in
his
round
among
the
manufacturing
towns
of
Yorkshire
and
Lancashire
.
 
<EOS>
Her
grandfather
,
too
,
had
seen
this
a
good
time
for
going
his
expeditions
in
search
of
specimens
;
so
that
the
house
had
been
shut
up
for
several
weeks
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
Margaret
,
Margaret
!
<EOS>
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
Take
care
.
 
<EOS>
There
now
,
you
're
all
right
,
that
's
father
's
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Sit
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
kissed
her
over
and
over
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
like
the
beginning
o
'
brighter
times
,
to
see
you
again
,
Margaret
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
you
!
 
<EOS>
And
how
well
you
look
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Doctors
always
send
ailing
folk
for
change
of
air
:
and
you
know
I
've
had
plenty
o
'
<EOS>
that
same
lately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
been
quite
a
traveller
for
sure
!
 
<EOS>
Tell
us
all
about
it
,
do
,
Margaret
.
 
<EOS>
Where
have
you
been
to
,
first
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
lass
,
that
would
take
a
long
time
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
Half
o'er
the
world
,
I
sometimes
think
.
 
<EOS>
Bolton
and
Bury
,
and
Owdham
,
and
Halifax
,
and
 
but
Mary
,
guess
who
I
saw
there
?
 
<EOS>
Maybe
you
know
,
though
,
so
it
's
not
fair
guessing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
dunnot
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
Margaret
,
for
I
can
not
abide
waiting
and
guessing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
one
night
as
I
were
going
fra
'
my
lodgings
wi
'
the
help
on
a
lad
as
belonged
to
th
'
landlady
,
to
find
the
room
where
I
were
to
sing
,
I
heard
a
cough
before
me
,
walking
along
.
 
<EOS>
Thinks
I
<EOS>
,
that
's
Jem
Wilson
's
cough
,
or
I
'm
much
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
Next
time
came
a
sneeze
and
cough
,
and
then
I
were
certain
.
 
<EOS>
First
I
hesitated
whether
I
should
speak
,
thinking
if
it
were
a
stranger
<EOS>
he
'd
maybe
think
me
forrard
.
<EOS>
*
 
<EOS>
But
I
knew
blind
folks
must
not
be
nesh
about
using
their
tongues
,
so
<EOS>
says
I
,
"
Jem
Wilson
,
is
that
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
And
sure
enough
it
was
,
and
nobody
else
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
know
he
were
in
Halifax
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
answered
,
faintly
and
sadly
;
for
Halifax
was
all
the
same
to
her
heart
as
the
Antipodes
;
equally
inaccessible
by
humble
penitent
looks
and
maidenly
tokens
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
he
's
there
,
however
:
he
's
putting
up
an
engine
for
some
folks
there
,
for
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
doing
well
,
for
he
's
getten
four
or
five
men
under
him
;
we
'd
two
or
three
meetings
,
and
he
telled
me
all
about
his
invention
for
doing
away
wi
'
the
crank
,
or
somewhat
.
<EOS>
His
master
's
bought
it
from
him
,
and
ta'en
out
a
patent
,
and
Jem
's
a
gentleman
for
life
<EOS>
wi
'
the
money
his
master
gied
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
'll
ha
'
heard
all
this
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
she
had
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
thought
it
all
happened
afore
<EOS>
he
left
Manchester
,
and
then
in
course
you
'd
ha
'
known
.
 
<EOS>
But
maybe
it
were
all
settled
after
he
got
to
Halifax
;
however
,
he
's
gotten
two
or
three
hunder
pounds
for
his
invention
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
's
up
with
you
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
you
're
sadly
out
of
sorts
.
 
<EOS>
You
've
never
been
quarrelling
wi
'
Jem
,
surely
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
Mary
cried
outright
;
she
was
weak
in
body
,
and
unhappy
in
mind
,
and
the
time
was
come
when
she
might
have
the
relief
of
telling
her
grief
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
confess
how
much
of
her
sorrow
was
caused
by
her
having
been
vain
and
foolish
;
she
hoped
that
need
never
be
known
,
and
she
could
not
bear
to
think
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
Margaret
!
<EOS>
do
you
know
Jem
came
here
one
night
when
I
were
put
out
,
and
cross
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
dear
!
<EOS>
I
could
bite
my
tongue
out
when
I
think
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
told
me
how
he
loved
me
,
and
I
thought
I
did
not
love
him
,
and
I
told
him
I
did
n't
;
<EOS>
and
,
Margaret
,
 
he
believed
me
,
and
went
away
so
sad
,
and
so
angry
;
and
now
,
I
'd
do
anything
 
I
would
indeed
"
;
her
sobs
choked
the
end
of
her
sentence
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
looked
at
her
with
sorrow
,
but
with
hope
;
for
she
had
no
doubt
in
her
own
mind
,
that
it
was
only
a
temporary
estrangement
,
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
Margaret
,
"
said
Mary
,
taking
her
apron
down
from
her
eyes
,
and
looking
at
Margaret
with
eager
anxiety
,
"
what
can
I
do
to
bring
him
back
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
Should
I
write
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
her
friend
,
"
that
would
not
do
.
 
<EOS>
Men
are
so
queer
,
they
like
to
have
a
'
the
courting
to
themselves
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
did
not
mean
to
write
him
a
courting
letter
,
"
said
Mary
,
somewhat
indignantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
wrote
at
all
,
it
would
be
to
give
him
a
hint
you
'd
taken
the
rue
,
and
would
be
very
glad
to
have
him
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
now
he
'd
rather
find
that
out
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
wo
n't
try
,
"
said
Mary
,
sighing
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
can
he
find
it
out
when
he
's
at
Halifax
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
's
a
will
<EOS>
he
's
a
way
,
depend
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
would
not
have
him
if
he
's
not
a
will
to
you
,
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
dear
!
"
<EOS>
changing
her
tone
from
the
somewhat
hard
way
in
which
sensible
people
too
often
speak
,
to
the
soft
accents
of
tenderness
which
come
with
such
peculiar
grace
from
them
,
"
you
must
just
wait
and
be
patient
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
depend
upon
it
,
all
will
end
well
,
and
better
than
if
you
meddled
in
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
so
hard
to
be
patient
,
"
pleaded
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
dear
;
being
patient
is
the
hardest
work
<EOS>
we
,
any
of
us
,
have
to
do
through
life
<EOS>
,
I
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
Waiting
is
far
more
difficult
than
doing
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
known
that
about
my
sight
,
and
many
a
one
has
known
it
in
watching
the
sick
;
but
it
's
one
of
God
's
lessons
we
all
must
learn
,
one
way
or
another
.
"
 
<EOS>
After
a
pause
 
"
Have
ye
been
to
see
his
mother
of
late
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
for
some
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
When
last
I
went
she
was
so
frabbit
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
with
me
,
that
I
really
thought
she
wished
I
'd
keep
away
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
Well
!
<EOS>
if
I
were
you
I
'd
go
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
will
hear
on't
,
and
it
will
do
you
far
more
good
in
his
mind
than
writing
a
letter
,
which
,
after
all
,
you
would
find
a
tough
piece
of
work
when
you
came
to
settle
to
it
.
'
<EOS>
T
would
be
hard
to
say
neither
too
much
nor
too
little
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
be
going
,
grandfather
is
at
home
,
and
it
's
our
first
night
together
,
and
he
must
not
be
sitting
wanting
me
any
longer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
rose
up
from
her
seat
,
but
still
delayed
going
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
I
've
somewhat
else
<EOS>
I
want
to
say
to
you
,
and
I
do
n't
rightly
know
how
to
begin
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
grandfather
<EOS>
and
I
know
what
bad
times
is
,
and
<EOS>
we
know
your
father
is
out
of
work
,
and
I
'm
getting
more
money
than
I
can
well
manage
;
and
,
dear
,
would
you
just
take
this
bit
o
'
gold
,
and
pay
me
back
in
good
times
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
tears
stood
in
Margaret
's
eyes
as
she
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Margaret
,
we
're
not
so
bad
pressed
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
The
thought
of
her
father
and
his
ill
looks
,
and
his
one
meal
a
day
,
rushed
upon
Mary
.
)
 
<EOS>
"
And
yet
,
dear
,
if
it
would
not
put
you
out
o
'
your
way
 
I
would
work
hard
to
make
it
up
to
you
;
 
but
would
not
your
grandfather
be
vexed
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
he
,
wench
!
 
<EOS>
It
were
more
his
thought
than
mine
,
and
we
have
gotten
ever
so
many
more
at
home
,
so
do
n't
hurry
yourself
about
paying
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
hard
to
be
blind
,
to
be
sure
,
else
money
comes
in
so
easily
now
to
what
it
used
to
do
;
and
it
's
downright
pleasure
to
earn
it
,
for
I
do
so
like
singing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
sing
,
"
said
Mary
,
looking
at
the
sovereign
.
  
<EOS>
"
Some
has
one
kind
of
gifts
,
and
some
another
.
 
<EOS>
Many
's
the
time
when
I
could
see
,
that
I
longed
for
your
beauty
,
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
We
're
like
childer
,
ever
wanting
what
we
han
not
got
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
I
must
say
just
one
more
word
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
,
if
you
're
sore
pressed
for
money
,
we
shall
take
it
very
unkind
if
you
donnot
let
us
know
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
to
ye
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
spite
of
her
blindness
she
hurried
away
,
anxious
to
rejoin
her
grandfather
,
and
desirous
also
to
escape
from
Mary
's
expressions
of
gratitude
.
  
<EOS>
Her
visit
had
done
Mary
good
in
many
ways
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
strengthened
her
patience
and
her
hope
;
it
had
given
her
confidence
in
Margaret
's
sympathy
;
and
last
,
and
really
least
in
comforting
power
(
of
so
little
value
are
silver
and
gold
in
comparison
to
love
,
that
gift
in
every
one
's
power
to
bestow
)
,
came
the
consciousness
of
the
money
-
value
of
the
sovereign
she
held
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
many
things
it
might
purchase
!
 
<EOS>
First
of
all
came
the
thought
of
the
comfortable
supper
for
her
father
that
very
night
;
and
acting
instantly
upon
the
idea
,
she
set
off
in
hopes
that
all
the
provision
shops
might
not
yet
be
closed
,
although
it
was
so
late
.
  
<EOS>
That
night
the
cottage
shone
with
unusual
light
and
fire
gleam
;
and
the
father
and
daughter
sat
down
to
a
meal
they
thought
almost
extravagant
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
so
long
since
they
had
had
enough
to
eat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Food
gives
heart
,
"
say
the
Lancashire
people
;
and
the
next
day
Mary
made
time
to
go
and
call
on
Mrs.
Wilson
,
according
to
Margaret
's
advice
.
 
<EOS>
She
found
her
quite
alone
,
and
more
gracious
than
she
had
been
the
last
time
Mary
had
visited
her
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
was
gone
out
,
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
just
step
up
to
the
post
-
office
,
all
for
no
earthly
use
.
<EOS>
For
it
were
to
ask
if
they
had
n't
a
letter
lying
there
for
her
from
her
foster
-
son
,
Will
Wilson
,
the
sailor
-
lad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
made
her
think
there
were
a
letter
?
"
asked
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yo
see
,
a
neighbour
as
has
been
in
Liverpool
,
telled
us
<EOS>
Will
's
ship
were
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
Now
he
said
last
time
he
were
in
Liverpool
,
he
'd
ha
'
come
to
ha
'
seen
Alice
,
but
his
ship
had
<EOS>
but
a
week
holiday
,
and
hard
work
for
the
men
in
that
time
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
So
Alice
makes
sure
he
'll
come
this
,
and
has
had
her
hand
behind
her
ear
at
every
noise
in
th
'
street
,
thinking
it
were
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
-
day
she
were
neither
to
have
nor
to
hold
,
but
off
she
would
go
to
th
'
post
,
and
see
if
he
had
na
sent
her
a
line
to
th
'
old
house
near
yo
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
to
get
her
to
give
up
going
,
for
let
alone
her
deafness
she
's
getten
so
dark
<EOS>
,
she
can
not
see
five
yards
afore
her
;
but
no
,
she
would
go
,
poor
old
body
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
know
her
sight
failed
her
;
she
used
to
have
good
eyes
enough
when
she
lived
near
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
but
it
's
gone
lately
a
good
deal
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
never
ask
after
Jem
"
 
a
nxious
to
get
in
a
word
on
the
subject
nearest
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Mary
,
blushing
scarlet
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
justly
say
how
he
is
,
seeing
he
's
at
Halifax
;
but
he
were
very
well
when
he
wrote
last
Tuesday
.
 
<EOS>
Han
ye
heard
o
'
his
good
luck
?
"
  
<EOS>
Rather
to
her
disappointment
,
Mary
owned
she
had
heard
of
the
sum
his
master
had
paid
him
for
his
invention
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
and
did
not
Margaret
tell
you
what
he
'd
done
wi
'
it
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
just
like
him
,
though
,
ne'er
to
say
a
word
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
when
he
were
paid
,
what
does
he
do
but
get
his
master
to
help
him
to
buy
an
income
for
me
and
Alice
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
her
name
put
down
for
her
life
;
but
,
poor
thing
,
she
'll
not
be
long
to
the
fore
,
I
'm
thinking
.
<EOS>
She
's
sadly
failed
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
Mary
,
yo
see
,
we
're
two
ladies
o
'
property
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
matter
o
'
twenty
pound
a
year
,
they
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
the
twins
had
lived
,
bless
'
em
,
"
said
she
,
dropping
a
few
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
should
ha
'
had
the
best
o
'
schooling
,
and
their
bellyfuls
o
'
food
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
're
better
off
in
heaven
,
only
I
should
so
like
to
see
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
's
heart
filled
with
love
at
this
new
proof
of
Jem
's
goodness
;
but
she
could
not
talk
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
Jane
Wilson
's
hand
,
and
pressed
it
with
affection
;
and
then
turned
the
subject
to
Will
,
her
sailor
nephew
.
 
<EOS>
Jane
was
a
little
bit
sorry
,
but
her
prosperity
had
made
her
gentler
,
and
she
did
not
resent
what
she
felt
at
Mary
's
indifference
to
Jem
and
his
merits
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
been
in
Africa
,
and
that
neighbourhood
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
fine
chap
,
but
he
's
not
getten
Jem
's
hair
.
 
<EOS>
His
has
too
much
o
'
the
red
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
sent
Alice
<EOS>
(
but
,
maybe
,
she
telled
you
)
<EOS>
a
matter
o
'
five
pound
when
he
were
over
before
:
but
that
were
nought
to
an
income
,
yo
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
every
one
that
can
get
a
hundred
or
two
at
a
time
,
"
said
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
no
!
<EOS>
that
's
true
enough
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
not
many
a
one
like
Jem
.
<EOS>
That
's
Alice
's
step
,
"
said
she
,
<EOS>
hastening
to
open
the
door
to
her
sister
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
looked
weary
,
and
sad
,
and
dusty
.
 
<EOS>
The
weariness
and
the
dust
would
not
have
been
noticed
either
by
her
,
or
the
others
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
sadness
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
letters
?
"
said
Mrs.
Wilson
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
none
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
just
wait
another
day
to
hear
fra
'
my
lad
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
very
dree
work
,
waiting
,
"
said
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
Margaret
's
words
came
into
Mary
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Every
one
has
their
time
and
kind
of
waiting
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
I
but
knew
he
were
safe
,
and
not
drowned
!
"
<EOS>
spoke
Alice
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
I
but
knew
he
WERE
drowned
,
I
would
ask
grace
to
say
,
Thy
will
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
waiting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
hard
work
to
be
patient
to
all
of
us
,
"
said
Mary
;
"
I
know
I
find
it
so
,
but
I
did
not
know
one
so
good
as
you
did
,
Alice
<EOS>
;
I
shall
not
think
so
badly
of
myself
for
being
a
bit
impatient
,
now
I
've
heard
you
say
you
find
it
difficult
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
idea
of
reproach
to
Alice
was
the
last
in
Mary
's
mind
;
and
Alice
knew
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
she
said
   
"
<EOS>
Then
,
my
dear
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
and
God
's
pardon
,
too
,
if
I
've
weakened
your
faith
,
by
showing
you
how
feeble
mine
was
.
 
<EOS>
Half
our
life
's
spent
in
waiting
,
and
it
ill
becomes
one
like
me
,
wi
'
so
many
mercies
,
to
grumble
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
try
and
put
a
bridle
<EOS>
o'er
my
tongue
,
and
my
thoughts
too
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
spoke
in
a
humble
and
gentle
voice
,
like
one
asking
forgiveness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Alice
,
"
interposed
Mrs.
Wilson
,
"
do
n't
fret
yoursel
for
e'er
<EOS>
a
trifle
wrong
said
here
or
there
.
 
<EOS>
See
!
<EOS>
I
've
put
th
'
kettle
on
,
and
you
and
Mary
shall
ha
'
a
dish
o
'
tea
in
no
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
she
bustled
about
,
and
brought
out
a
comfortable
-
looking
substantial
loaf
,
and
set
Mary
to
cut
bread
and
butter
,
while
she
rattled
out
the
tea
-
cups
 
always
a
cheerful
sound
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
they
were
sitting
down
,
there
was
a
knock
heard
at
the
door
,
and
without
waiting
for
it
to
be
opened
from
the
inside
,
some
one
lifted
the
latch
,
and
in
a
man
's
voice
asked
,
if
one
George
Wilson
lived
there
?
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilson
was
entering
on
a
long
and
sorrowful
explanation
of
his
having
once
lived
there
,
but
of
his
having
dropped
down
dead
;
when
Alice
,
with
the
instinct
of
love
(
for
in
all
usual
and
common
instances
sight
and
hearing
failed
to
convey
impressions
to
her
until
long
after
other
people
had
received
them
)
,
arose
,
and
tottered
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
bairn
!
 
<EOS>
my
own
dear
bairn
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
falling
on
Will
Wilson
's
neck
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
fancy
the
hospitable
and
welcoming
commotion
that
ensued
;
how
Mrs.
Wilson
laughed
,
and
talked
,
and
cried
,
all
together
,
if
such
a
thing
can
be
done
;
and
how
Mary
gazed
with
wondering
pleasure
at
her
old
playmate
;
now
a
dashing
,
bronzed
-
looking
,
ringleted
sailor
,
frank
,
and
hearty
,
and
affectionate
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
something
different
from
common
to
see
Alice
's
joy
at
once
more
having
her
foster
-
child
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
speak
,
for
she
really
could
not
;
but
the
tears
came
coursing
down
her
old
withered
cheeks
,
and
dimmed
the
horn
spectacles
she
had
put
on
,
in
order
to
pry
lovingly
into
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
So
what
with
her
failing
sight
,
and
her
tear
-
blinded
eyes
,
she
gave
up
the
attempt
of
learning
his
face
by
heart
through
the
medium
of
that
sense
,
and
tried
another
.
 
<EOS>
She
passed
her
sodden
,
shrivelled
hands
,
all
trembling
with
eagerness
,
over
his
manly
face
,
bent
meekly
down
in
order
that
she
might
more
easily
make
her
strange
inspection
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
her
soul
was
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
After
tea
,
Mary
feeling
sure
there
was
much
to
be
said
on
both
sides
,
at
which
it
would
be
better
none
should
be
present
,
not
even
an
intimate
friend
like
herself
,
got
up
to
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
This
seemed
to
arouse
Alice
from
her
dreamy
consciousness
of
exceeding
happiness
,
and
she
hastily
followed
Mary
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
standing
outside
,
with
the
latch
in
her
hand
,
she
took
hold
of
Mary
's
arm
,
and
spoke
nearly
the
first
words
she
had
uttered
since
her
nephew
's
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
!
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forgive
mysel
,
if
my
wicked
words
to
-
night
are
any
stumbling
-
block
in
your
path
.
 
<EOS>
See
how
the
Lord
has
put
coals
of
fire
on
my
head
!
 
<EOS>
O
Mary
,
do
n't
let
my
being
an
unbelieving
Thomas
weaken
your
faith
.
 
<EOS>
Wait
patiently
on
the
Lord

whatever
your
trouble
may
be

The

upon

All

Admiring

combing

And
singing

It
was
perhaps
four
or
five
days
after
the
events
mentioned
in
the
last
chapter
,
that
one
evening
,
as
Mary
stood
lost
in
reverie
at
the
window
,
she
saw
Will
Wilson
enter
the
court
,
and
come
quickly
up
to
her
door
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
glad
to
see
him
,
for
he
had
always
been
a
friend
of
hers
,
perhaps
too
much
like
her
in
character
ever
to
become
anything
nearer
or
dearer
.
 
<EOS>
She
opened
the
door
in
readiness
to
receive
his
frank
greeting
,
which
she
as
frankly
returned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Mary
!
<EOS>
on
with
bonnet
and
shawl
,
or
whatever
rigging
you
women
require
before
leaving
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sent
to
fetch
you
,
and
I
ca
n't
lose
time
when
I
'm
under
orders
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
am
I
to
go
to
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Mary
,
as
her
heart
leaped
up
at
the
thought
of
who
might
be
waiting
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
very
far
,
"
replied
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
to
old
<EOS>
Job
Legh
's
round
the
corner
there
.
 
<EOS>
Aunt
would
have
me
come
and
see
these
new
friends
of
hers
,
and
then
we
meant
to
ha
'
come
on
here
to
see
you
and
your
father
,
but
the
old
gentleman
seems
inclined
to
make
a
night
of
it
,
and
have
you
all
there
.
 
<EOS>
Where
is
your
father
?
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
must
come
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
out
,
but
I
'll
leave
word
next
door
for
him
to
follow
me
;
that
's
to
say
,
if
he
comes
home
afore
long
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
added
hesitatingly
,
"
Is
any
one
else
at
Job
's
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
Jane
would
not
come
,
for
some
maggot
or
other
;
and
as
for
Jem
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
you
've
all
been
doing
to
him
,
but
he
's
as
down
-
hearted
a
chap
as
I
'd
wish
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
had
his
sorrows
sure
enough
,
poor
lad
!
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
time
for
him
to
be
shaking
off
his
dull
looks
,
and
not
go
moping
like
a
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
he
's
come
<EOS>
fra
'
Halifax
,
is
he
?
"
asked
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
his
body
's
come
,
but
I
think
he
's
left
his
heart
behind
him
.
<EOS>
His
tongue
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
he
has
,
as
we
used
to
say
to
childer
,
when
they
would
not
speak
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
to
rouse
him
up
a
bit
,
and
I
think
he
likes
having
me
with
him
,
but
still
he
's
as
gloomy
and
as
dull
as
can
be
.
'
<EOS>
Twas
only
yesterday
he
took
me
to
the
works
,
and
you
'd
ha
'
thought
us
two
Quakers
as
the
spirit
had
n't
moved
,
all
the
way
down
<EOS>
we
were
so
mum
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
place
to
craze
a
man
,
certainly
;
such
a
noisy
black
hole
!
 
<EOS>
There
were
one
or
two
things
worth
looking
at
,
the
bellows
for
instance
,
or
the
gale
they
called
a
bellows
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
ha
'
stood
near
it
a
whole
day
;
and
if
I
'd
a
berth
in
that
place
,
I
should
like
to
be
bellows
-
man
,
if
there
is
such
a
one
.
 
<EOS>
But
Jem
were
n't
diverted
even
with
that
;
he
stood
as
grave
as
a
judge
while
it
blew
my
hat
out
o
'
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
lost
all
relish
for
his
food
,
too
,
which
frets
my
aunt
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
Mary
,
are
n't
you
ready
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
not
been
able
to
gather
if
she
were
to
see
Jem
at
Job
Legh
's
;
but
when
the
door
was
opened
,
she
at
once
saw
and
felt
he
was
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
evening
then
would
be
a
blank
;
at
least
so
she
thought
for
the
first
five
minutes
;
but
she
soon
forgot
her
disappointment
in
the
cheerful
meeting
of
old
friends
,
all
,
except
herself
,
with
some
cause
for
rejoicing
at
that
very
time
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
,
who
could
not
be
idle
,
was
knitting
away
,
with
her
face
looking
full
into
the
room
,
away
from
her
work

<EOS>
Alice
sat
meek
and
patient
with
her
dimmed
eyes
and
gentle
look
,
trying
to
see
and
to
hear
,
but
never
complaining
;
indeed
,
in
her
inner
self
she
was
blessing
God
for
her
happiness
;
for
the
joy
of
having
her
nephew
,
her
child
,
near
her
,
was
far
more
present
to
her
mind
,
than
her
deprivations
of
sight
and
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
Job
was
in
the
full
glory
of
host
and
hostess
too
,
for
by
a
tacit
agreement
he
had
roused
himself
from
his
habitual
abstraction
,
and
had
assumed
many
of
Margaret
's
little
household
duties
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
moved
about
he
was
deep
in
conversation
with
the
young
sailor
,
trying
to
extract
from
him
any
circumstances
connected
with
the
natural
history
of
the
different
countries
he
had
visited
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
if
you
are
fond
of
grubs
,
and
flies
,
and
beetles
,
there
's
no
place
for
'em
like
Sierra
Leone
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
'd
had
some
of
ours
;
we
had
rather
too
much
of
a
good
thing
;
we
drank
them
with
our
drink
,
and
could
scarcely
keep
from
eating
them
with
our
food
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
any
folk
could
care
for
such
fat
green
beasts
as
those
,
or
I
would
ha
'
brought
you
them
by
the
thousand
.
 
<EOS>
A
plate
full
o
'
peas
soup
would
ha
'
been
full
enough
for
you
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
;
it
were
often
too
full
for
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
ha
'
given
a
good
deal
for
some
on
'
em
,
"
said
Job
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
knew
folk
at
home
liked
some
o
'
the
queer
things
one
meets
with
abroad
;
but
I
never
thought
they
'd
care
for
them
nasty
slimy
things
.
 
<EOS>
I
were
always
on
the
look
-
out
for
a
mermaid
,
for
that
<EOS>
,
I
knew
,
were
a
curiosity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
ha
'
looked
long
enough
,
"
said
Job
,
in
an
undertone
of
contempt
,
which
,
however
,
the
quick
ears
of
the
sailor
caught
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
so
long
,
master
,
in
some
latitudes
,
as
you
think
.
 
<EOS>
It
stands
to
reason
th
<EOS>
'
sea
hereabouts
is
too
cold
for
mermaids
;
for
women
here
do
n't
go
half
naked
on
account
o
'
climate
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
've
been
in
lands
where
muslin
were
too
hot
to
wear
on
land
,
and
where
the
sea
were
more
than
milk
-
warm
;
and
<EOS>
though
I
'd
never
the
good
luck
to
see
a
mermaid
in
that
latitude
,
I
know
them
that
has
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
tell
us
about
it
,
"
cried
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
,
pooh
!
<EOS>
"
said
Job
,
the
naturalist
.
  
<EOS>
Both
speeches
determined
Will
to
go
on
with
his
story
.
 
<EOS>
What
could
a
fellow
who
had
never
been
many
miles
from
home
know
about
the
wonders
of
the
deep
,
that
he
should
put
him
down
in
that
way
?
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
were
Jack
Harris
,
our
third
mate
last
voyage
,
as
many
and
many
a
time
telled
us
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
he
were
becalmed
off
Chatham
Island
(
that
's
in
the
Great
Pacific
,
and
a
warm
enough
latitude
for
mermaids
,
and
sharks
,
and
such
like
perils
)
.
 
<EOS>
So
some
of
the
men
took
the
long
-
boat
,
and
pulled
for
the
island
to
see
what
it
were
like
;
and
when
they
got
near
,
they
heard
a
puffing
,
like
a
creature
come
up
to
take
breath
;
you
've
never
heard
a
diver
?
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
Well
;
you
've
heard
folks
in
th
'
asthma
,
and
it
were
for
all
the
world
like
that
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
looked
around
,
and
what
should
they
see
but
a
mermaid
,
sitting
on
a
rock
,
and
sunning
herself
.
 
<EOS>
The
water
is
always
warmer
when
it
's
rough
,
you
know
,
so
I
suppose
in
the
calm
she
felt
it
rather
chilly
,
and
had
come
up
to
warm
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
was
she
like
?
"
asked
Mary
breathlessly
.
  
<EOS>
Job
took
his
pipe
off
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
began
to
smoke
with
very
audible
puffs
,
as
if
the
story
were
not
worth
listening
to
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Jack
used
to
say
she
was
for
all
the
world
as
beautiful
as
any
of
the
wax
ladies
in
the
barbers
'
shops
;
only
,
Mary
,
there
were
one
little
difference
;
her
hair
was
bright
grass
-
green
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
think
that
was
pretty
,
"
said
Mary
hesitatingly
;
as
if
not
liking
to
doubt
the
perfection
of
anything
belonging
to
such
an
acknowledged
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
but
it
is
when
you
're
used
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
think
when
first
we
get
sight
of
land
,
there
's
no
colour
so
lovely
as
grass
-
green
.
<EOS>
However
,
she
had
green
hair
sure
enough
:
and
were
proud
enough
of
it
,
too
;
for
she
were
combing
it
out
full
length
when
first
they
saw
her
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
thought
she
were
a
fair
prize
,
and
maybe
as
good
as
a
whale
in
ready
money
(
they
were
whale
-
fishers
,
you
know
)
.
 
<EOS>
For
some
folk
think
a
deal
of
mermaids
,
whatever
other
folk
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
hit
at
Job
,
who
retaliated
in
a
series
of
sonorous
spittings
and
puffs
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
,
as
I
were
saying
,
they
pulled
towards
her
,
thinking
to
catch
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
were
all
the
while
combing
her
beautiful
hair
,
and
beckoning
to
them
,
while
with
the
other
hand
she
held
a
looking
-
glass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
many
hands
had
she
?
"
asked
Job
.
  
<EOS>
"
Two
,
to
be
sure
,
just
like
any
other
woman
,
"
answered
Will
indignantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
thought
you
said
she
beckoned
with
one
hand
,
and
combed
her
hair
with
another
,
and
held
a
looking
-
glass
with
her
third
,
"
said
Job
,
with
provoking
quietness
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
!
<EOS>
at
least
,
if
I
did
,
I
meant
she
did
one
thing
after
another
,
as
anyone
but
<EOS>
"
(
here
he
mumbled
a
word
or
two
)
"
could
understand
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Mary
,
"
turning
very
decidedly
towards
her
,
"
when
she
saw
them
coming
near
,
whether
it
were
she
grew
frightened
at
their
fowling
-
pieces
,
as
they
had
on
board
for
a
bit
<EOS>
o
'
shooting
on
the
island
,
or
whether
it
were
she
were
just
a
fickle
jade
as
did
not
rightly
know
her
own
mind
(
which
,
seeing
one
half
of
her
was
woman
,
I
think
myself
was
most
probably
)
,
but
when
they
were
only
about
two
oars
'
length
from
the
rock
where
she
sat
,
down
she
plopped
into
the
water
,
leaving
nothing
but
her
hinder
end
of
a
fish
tail
sticking
up
for
a
minute
,
and
then
that
disappeared
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
they
never
see
her
again
?
"
asked
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
so
plain
;
the
man
who
had
the
second
watch
one
night
declared
he
saw
her
swimming
round
the
ship
,
and
holding
up
her
glass
for
him
to
look
in
;
and
then
he
saw
the
little
cottage
near
Aber
in
Wales
(
where
his
wife
lived
)
as
plain
as
ever
<EOS>
he
saw
it
in
life
,
and
his
wife
standing
outside
,
shading
her
eyes
as
if
she
were
looking
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
Jack
Harris
gave
him
no
credit
,
for
he
said
he
were
always
a
bit
of
a
romancer
,
and
beside
that
,
were
a
home
-
sick
,
down
-
hearted
chap
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
they
had
caught
her
,
"
said
Mary
,
musing
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
got
one
thing
as
belonged
to
her
,
"
replied
Will
,
"
and
that
I
've
often
seen
with
my
own
eyes
,
and
I
reckon
it
's
a
sure
proof
of
the
truth
of
their
story
,
for
them
that
wants
proof
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
was
it
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Margaret
,
almost
anxious
her
grandfather
should
be
convinced
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
in
her
hurry
she
left
her
comb
on
the
rock
,
and
one
o
'
<EOS>
the
men
spied
it
;
so
they
thought
that
were
better
than
nothing
,
and
they
rowed
there
and
took
it
,
and
Jack
Harris
had
it
on
board
the
John
Cropper
,
and
I
saw
him
comb
his
hair
with
it
every
Sunday
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
was
it
like
?
"
asked
Mary
eagerly
;
her
imagination
running
on
coral
combs
,
studded
with
pearls
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
if
it
had
not
had
such
a
strange
yarn
belonging
to
it
,
you
'd
never
ha
'
noticed
it
from
any
other
small
-
tooth
comb
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
rather
think
not
,
"
sneered
Job
Legh
.
  
<EOS>
The
sailor
bit
his
lips
to
keep
down
his
anger
against
an
old
man
.
<EOS>
Margaret
felt
very
uneasy
,
knowing
her
grandfather
so
well
,
and
not
daring
to
guess
what
caustic
remark
might
come
next
to
irritate
the
young
sailor
guest
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
,
however
,
was
too
much
interested
by
the
wonders
of
the
deep
to
perceive
the
incredulity
with
which
Job
Legh
received
Wilson
's
account
of
the
mermaid
,
and
when
he
left
off
,
half
offended
,
and
very
much
inclined
not
to
open
his
lips
again
through
the
evening
,
she
eagerly
said
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
tell
us
something
more
of
what
you
hear
and
see
on
board
ship
.
 
<EOS>
Do
,
Will
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
use
,
Mary
,
if
folk
wo
n't
believe
one
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
things
I
saw
with
my
own
eyes
,
that
some
people
would
pish
and
pshaw
at
,
as
if
I
were
a
baby
to
be
put
down
by
cross
noises
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
tell
you
,
Mary
,
"
with
an
emphasis
on
YOU
,
"
some
more
of
the
wonders
of
the
sea
,
sin
'
<EOS>
you
're
not
too
wise
to
believe
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
a
fish
fly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
did
stagger
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
heard
of
mermaids
as
signs
of
inns
and
as
sea
-
wonders
,
but
never
of
flying
fish
.
 
<EOS>
Not
so
Job
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
down
his
pipe
,
and
nodding
his
head
as
a
token
of
approbation
,
he
said
   
"
<EOS>
Ay
!
<EOS>
ay
!
<EOS>
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
Now
you
're
speaking
truth

<EOS>
"
Well
,
now
,
you
'll
swallow
that
,
old
gentleman

<EOS>
You
'll
credit
me
when
I
say
I
've
seen
a
critter
half
fish
,
half
bird
,
and
you
wo
n't
credit
me
when
I
say
there
be
such
beasts
as
mermaids
,
half
fish
,
half
woman

<EOS>
To
me
,
one
's
just
as
strange
as
t'other

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
saw
the
mermaid
yoursel
,
"
interposed
Margaret
gently
.
<EOS>
But
"
love
me
,
love
my
dog
,
"
was
Will
Wilson
's
motto
,
only
his
version
was
,
"
Believe
me
,
believe
Jack
Harris
"
;
and
the
remark
was
not
so
soothing
to
him
as
it
was
intended
to
have
been
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
Exocetus
;
one
of
the
Malacopterygii
Abdominales
,
"
said
Job
,
much
interested
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay

there
you
go
!
<EOS>
you
're
one
o

<EOS>
them
folks

out

<EOS>
Put
'em
in

and
you
know
'em

but
in
their
work

a

day
English
you

I
've
met

many
o

your

if
I

known

I

christened
poor

mermaid
wi

some
grand
gibberish
of
a
name

<EOS>
Mermaidicus
Jack
Harrisensis
;
that
's
just
like
their
new

fangled
words

<EOS>
D'ye
believe
there
's
such
a
thing
as
the
Mermaidicus

master

"
<EOS>
asked
Will
,
enjoying
his
own
joke
uncommonly
,
as
most
people
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
I
!
<EOS>
tell
me
about
the

"
Well
!
<EOS>
"
said
Will
,
pleased
at
having
excited
the
old
gentleman
's
faith
and
credit
at
last
,
"
it
were
on
this
last
voyage
,
about
a
day
's
sail
from
Madeira
,
that
one
of
our
men

<EOS>
"
Not
Jack
Harris
,
I
hope

"
murmured
Job
.
  
<EOS>
"
Called
me
,
"
continued
Will
,
not
noticing
the
interruption
,
"
to
see
the
what
d'ye
call
it
 
flying
fish
<EOS>
I
say
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
It
were
twenty
feet
out
o

water
,
and
it
flew
near
on
to
a
hundred
yards
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
say
,
old
gentleman

,
I
ha

gotten
one
dried
,

if
you
'll
take
it

why

it

he
added
,
in
a
lower
tone
,
"
I
wish
you
'd
just
gie
me
credit
for
the
Mermaidicus
.

<EOS>
I
really
believe
,
if
the
assuming
faith
in
the
story
of
the
mermaid
had
been
made
the
condition
of
receiving
the
flying
fish
,
Job
Legh
,
sincere
man
as
he
was
,
would
have
pretended
belief
;
he
was
so
much
delighted
at
the
idea
of
possessing
this
specimen
.
 
<EOS>
He
won
the
sailor
's
heart
by
getting
up
to
shake
both
his
hands
in
his
vehement
gratitude
,
puzzling
poor
old
Alice
,
who
yet
smiled
through
her
wonder
;
for
she
understood
the
action
to
indicate
some
kindly
feeling
towards
her
nephew
.
  
<EOS>
Job
wanted
to
prove
his
gratitude
,
and
was
puzzled
how
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
feared
the
young
man
would
not
appreciate
any
of
his
duplicate
Araneides
;
not
even
the
great
American
Mygale
,
one
of
his
most
precious
treasures
;
or
else
he
would
gladly
have
bestowed
any
duplicate
on
the
donor
of
a
real
dried
Exocetus
.
 
<EOS>
What
could
he
do
for
him
?
 
<EOS>
He
could
ask
Margaret
to
sing
.
 
<EOS>
Other
folks
beside
her
old
doting
grandfather
thought
a
deal
of
her
songs
.
 
<EOS>
So
Margaret
began
some
of
her
noble
old
-
fashioned
songs
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
no
modern
music
(
for
which
her
auditors
might
have
been
thankful
)
,
but
she
poured
her
rich
voice
out
in
some
of
the
old
canzonets
she
had
lately
learnt
while
accompanying
the
musical
lecturer
on
his
tour
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
was
amused
to
see
how
the
young
sailor
sat
entranced
;
mouth
,
eyes
,
all
open
,
in
order
to
catch
every
breath
of
sound
.
 
<EOS>
His
very
lids
refused
to
wink
,
as
if
afraid
in
that
brief
proverbial
interval
to
lose
a
particle
of
the
rich
music
that
floated
through
the
room
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
the
idea
crossed
Mary
's
mind
that
it
was
possible
the
plain
little
sensible
Margaret
,
so
prim
and
demure
,
might
have
power
over
the
heart
of
the
handsome
,
dashing
spirited
Will
Wilson
.
  
<EOS>
Job
,
too
,
was
rapidly
changing
his
opinion
of
his
new
guest
.
 
<EOS>
The
flying
fish
went
a
great
way
,
and
his
undisguised
admiration
for
Margaret
's
singing
carried
him
still
further
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
amusing
enough
to
see
these
two
,
within
the
hour
so
barely
civil
to
each
other
,
endeavouring
now
to
be
ultra
-
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
Will
,
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
breath
(
a
long
,
deep
gasp
of
admiration
)
<EOS>
after
Margaret
's
song
,
sidled
up
to
Job
,
and
asked
him
in
a
sort
of
doubting
tone
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
like
a
live
Manx
cat
,
would
ye
,
master
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
what
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Job
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
its
best
name
,
"
said
Will
humbly
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
we
call
'em
just
Manx
cats
.
 
<EOS>
They
're
cats
without
tails
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
Job
,
in
all
his
natural
history
,
had
never
heard
of
such
animals
;
so
Will
continued
   
"
Because
I
'm
going
,
<EOS>
afore
joining
my
ship
,
to
see
mother
's
friends
in
the
island
,
and
would
gladly
bring
you
one
,
if
so
be
you
'd
like
to
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
look
as
queer
and
out
<EOS>
o
'
nature
as
flying
fish
,
or
<EOS>
"
 
h
e
gulped
the
words
down
that
should
have
followed
.
<EOS>
"
Especially
when
you
see
'em
walking
a
roof
-
top
,
right
again
the
sky
,
when
a
cat
,
as
is
a
proper
cat
,
is
sure
to
stick
her
tail
stiff
out
behind
,
like
a
slack
-
rope
dancer
a
-
balancing
;
but
these
cats
having
no
tail
,
can
not
stick
it
out
,
which
captivates
some
people
uncommonly
.
 
<EOS>
If
yo'll
allow
me
,
I
'll
bring
one
for
Miss
there
,
"
jerking
his
head
at
Margaret
.
 
<EOS>
Job
assented
with
grateful
curiosity
,
wishing
much
to
see
the
tailless
phenomenon
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
are
you
going
to
sail
?
"
asked
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
justly
say
;
our
ship
's
bound
for
America
next
voyage
,
they
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
A
messmate
will
let
me
know
when
her
sailing
-
day
is
fixed
;
but
I
've
got
to
go
to
th
<EOS>
'
Isle
o
'
Man
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
promised
uncle
<EOS>
last
time
I
were
in
England
to
go
this
next
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
to
hoist
the
blue
Peter
any
day
;
so
,
make
much
of
me
while
you
have
me
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Job
asked
him
if
he
had
been
in
America
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
n't
I
!
 
<EOS>
North
and
South
both
!
 
<EOS>
This
time
we
're
bound
to
North
.
<EOS>
Yankee
-
Land
<EOS>
as
we
call
it
,
where
Uncle
Sam
lives
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Uncle
who
?
"
said
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
a
way
sailors
have
of
speaking
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
only
mean
I
'm
going
to
Boston
,
U.S.
<EOS>
,
that
's
Uncle
Sam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
did
not
understand
,
so
she
left
him
and
went
to
sit
by
Alice
,
who
could
not
hear
conversation
unless
expressly
addressed
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
sat
patiently
silent
the
greater
part
of
the
night
,
and
now
greeted
Mary
with
a
quiet
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
's
yo'r
father
?
"
asked
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
guess
he
's
at
his
Union
!
<EOS>
he
's
there
most
evenings
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
shook
her
head
;
but
whether
it
were
that
she
did
not
hear
,
or
that
she
did
not
quite
approve
of
what
she
heard
,
Mary
could
not
make
out
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
silently
watching
Alice
,
and
regretting
over
her
dimmed
and
veiled
eyes
,
formerly
so
bright
and
speaking
.
 
<EOS>
As
if
Alice
understood
by
some
other
sense
what
was
passing
in
Mary
's
mind
,
she
turned
suddenly
round
,
and
answered
Mary
's
thought
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo're
mourning
for
me
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
and
there
's
no
need
,
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
as
happy
as
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
sometimes
think
I
am
a
child
,
whom
the
Lord
is
hushabying
to
my
long
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
For
when
I
were
a
nurse
-
girl
,
my
missis
always
telled
me
to
speak
very
soft
and
low
,
and
to
darken
the
room
that
her
little
one
might
go
to
sleep
;
and
now
all
noises
are
hushed
and
still
to
me
,
and
the
bonny
earth
seems
dim
and
dark
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
it
's
my
Father
lulling
me
away
to
my
long
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
very
well
content
;
and
yo
must
n't
fret
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
had
well
-
nigh
every
blessing
in
life
I
could
desire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
thought
of
Alice
's
long
-
cherished
,
fond
wish
to
revisit
the
home
of
her
childhood
,
so
often
and
often
deferred
,
and
now
probably
never
to
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
Or
if
it
did
,
how
changed
from
the
fond
anticipation
of
what
it
was
to
have
been
!
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
mockery
to
the
blind
and
deaf
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
The
evening
came
quickly
to
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
humble
cheerful
meal
,
and
then
the
bustling
,
merry
farewell
,
and
Mary
was
once
more
in
the
quietness
and
solitude
of
her
own
dingy
,
dreary
-
looking
home
;
her
father
still
out
,
the
fire
extinguished
,
and
her
evening
's
task
of
work
lying
all
undone
upon
the
dresser
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
had
been
a
pleasant
little
interlude
to
think
upon
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
distracted
her
attention
for
a
few
hours
from
the
pressure
of
many
uneasy
thoughts
,
of
the
dark
,
heavy
,
oppressive
times
,
when
sorrow
and
want
seemed
to
surround
her
on
every
side
;
of
her
father
,
his
changed
and
altered
looks
,
telling
so
plainly
of
broken
health
,
and
an
embittered
heart
;
of
the
morrow
,
and
the
morrow
beyond
that
,
to
be
spent
in
that
close
monotonous
workroom
,
with
Sally
Leadbitter
's
odious
whispers
hissing
in
her
ear
;
and
of
the
hunted
look
,
so
full
of
dread
,
from
Miss
Simmonds
'
door
-
step
up
and
down
the
street
,
lest
her
persecuting
lover
should
be
near
;
for
he
lay
in
wait
for
her
with
wonderful
perseverance
,
and
of
late
had
made
himself
almost
hateful
,
by
the
unmanly
force
which
he
had
used
to
detain
her
to
listen
to
him
,
and
the
indifference
with
which
he
exposed
her
to
the
remarks
of
the
passers
-
by
,
any
one
of
whom
might
circulate
reports
which
it
would
be
terrible
for
her
father
to
hear
 
and
worse
than
death
<EOS>
should
they
reach
Jem
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
And
all
this
she
had
drawn
upon
herself
by
her
giddy
flirting
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
she
loathed
the
recollection
of
the
hot
summer
evening
,
when
,
worn
out
by
stitching
and
sewing
,
she
had
loitered
homewards
with
weary
languor
,
and
first
listened
to
the
voice
of
the
tempter
.
  
<EOS>
And
Jem
Wilson
!
 
<EOS>
O
Jem
,
Jem
,
why
did
you
not
come
to
receive
some
of
the
modest
looks
and
words
of
love
which
Mary
longed
to
give
you
,
to
try
and
make
up
for
the
hasty
rejection
which
you
as
hastily
took
to
be
final
,
though
both
mourned
over
it
with
many
tears
.
 
<EOS>
But
day
after
day
passed
away
,
and
patience
seemed
of
no
avail
;
and
Mary
's
cry
was
ever
the
old
moan
of
the
Moated
Grange
   
"
<EOS>
"
Why
comes
he
not
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
I
am
aweary
,
aweary
.
<EOS>
I
would
that
I
were
dead

Esther
's
term
of
imprisonment
was
ended
.
 
<EOS>
She
received
a
good
character
in
the
governor
's
books
;
she
had
picked
her
daily
quantity
of
oakum
,
had
never
deserved
the
extra
punishment
of
the
treadmill
,
and
had
been
civil
and
decorous
in
her
language
.
 
<EOS>
And
once
more
she
was
out
of
prison
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
closed
behind
her
with
a
ponderous
clang
,
and
in
her
desolation
she
felt
as
if
shut
out
of
home
 
from
the
only
shelter
she
could
meet
with
,
houseless
and
penniless
as
she
was
,
on
that
dreary
day
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
but
for
an
instant
that
she
stood
there
doubting
.
 
<EOS>
One
thought
had
haunted
her
both
by
night
and
by
day
,
with
monomaniacal
incessancy
;
and
that
thought
was
how
to
save
Mary
(
her
dead
sister
's
only
child
,
her
own
little
pet
in
the
days
of
her
innocence
)
from
following
in
the
same
downward
path
to
vice
.
 
<EOS>
To
whom
could
she
speak
and
ask
for
aid
?
 
<EOS>
She
shrank
from
the
idea
of
addressing
John
Barton
again
;
her
heart
sank
within
her
,
at
the
remembrance
of
his
fierce
repulsing
action
,
and
far
fiercer
words
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
worse
than
death
to
reveal
her
condition
to
Mary
,
<EOS>
else
she
sometimes
thought
that
this
course
would
be
the
most
terrible
,
the
most
efficient
warning
.
 
<EOS>
She
must
speak
;
to
that
she
was
soul
-
compelled
;
but
to
whom
?
 
<EOS>
She
dreaded
addressing
any
of
her
former
female
acquaintance
,
even
supposing
they
had
sense
,
or
spirit
,
or
interest
enough
to
undertake
her
mission
.
  
<EOS>
To
whom
shall
the
outcast
prostitute
tell
her
tale
?
 
<EOS>
Who
will
give
her
help
in
the
day
of
need
?
 
<EOS>
Hers
is
the
leper
sin
,
and
all
stand
aloof
dreading
to
be
counted
unclean
.
  
<EOS>
In
her
wild
night
wanderings
,
she
had
noted
the
haunts
and
habits
of
many
a
one
who
little
thought
of
a
watcher
in
the
poor
forsaken
woman
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
easily
imagine
that
a
double
interest
was
attached
by
her
to
the
ways
and
companionships
of
those
with
whom
she
had
been
acquainted
in
the
days
which
,
when
present
,
she
had
considered
hardly
-
worked
and
monotonous
,
but
which
now
in
retrospection
seemed
so
happy
and
unclouded
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
she
had
,
as
we
have
seen
,
known
where
to
meet
with
John
Barton
on
that
unfortunate
night
,
which
had
only
produced
irritation
in
him
,
and
a
month
's
imprisonment
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
also
observed
that
he
was
still
intimate
with
the
Wilsons
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
seen
him
walking
and
talking
with
both
father
and
son
;
her
old
friends
too
;
and
she
had
shed
unregarded
,
unvalued
tears
,
when
some
one
had
casually
told
her
of
George
Wilson
's
sudden
death
.
 
<EOS>
It
now
flashed
across
her
mind
that
to
the
son
,
to
Mary
's
playfellow
,
her
elder
brother
in
the
days
of
childhood
,
her
tale
might
be
told
,
and
listened
to
with
interest
by
him
,
and
some
mode
of
action
suggested
by
which
Mary
might
be
guarded
and
saved
.
  
<EOS>
All
these
thoughts
had
passed
through
her
mind
while
yet
she
was
in
prison
;
so
when
she
was
turned
out
,
her
purpose
was
clear
,
and
she
did
not
feel
her
desolation
of
freedom
as
she
would
otherwise
have
done
.
  
<EOS>
That
night
she
stationed
herself
early
near
the
foundry
where
she
knew
Jem
worked
;
he
stayed
later
than
usual
,
being
detained
by
some
arrangements
for
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
She
grew
tired
and
impatient
;
many
workmen
had
come
out
of
the
door
in
the
long
,
dead
,
brick
wall
,
and
eagerly
had
she
peered
into
their
faces
,
deaf
to
all
insult
or
curse
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
gone
home
early
;
one
more
turn
in
the
street
,
and
she
would
go
.
  
<EOS>
During
that
turn
he
came
out
,
and
in
the
quiet
of
that
street
of
workshops
and
warehouses
,
she
directly
heard
his
steps
.
 
<EOS>
How
her
heart
failed
her
for
an
instant
!
<EOS>
but
still
she
was
not
daunted
from
her
purpose
,
painful
as
its
fulfilment
was
sure
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
She
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
expected
,
after
a
momentary
glance
at
the
person
who
thus
endeavoured
to
detain
him
,
he
made
an
effort
to
shake
it
off
,
and
pass
on
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
trembling
as
she
was
,
she
had
provided
against
this
by
a
firm
and
unusual
grasp
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
listen
to
me
,
Jem
Wilson
,
"
she
said
,
with
almost
an
accent
of
command
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
away
,
missis
;
I
've
nought
to
do
with
you
,
either
in
hearkening
or
talking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
made
another
struggle
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
listen
,
"
she
said
again
,
authoritatively
,
"
for
Mary
Barton
's
sake
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
spell
of
her
name
was
as
potent
as
that
of
the
mariner
's
glittering
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
listened
like
a
three
-
year
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
care
enough
for
her
to
wish
to
save
her
from
harm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
interrupted
his
earnest
gaze
into
her
face
,
with
the
exclamation
   
<EOS>
"
And
who
can
yo
be
to
know
Mary
Barton
,
or
to
know
that
she
's
aught
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
strife
in
Esther
's
mind
for
an
instant
,
between
the
shame
of
acknowledging
herself
,
and
the
additional
weight
to
her
revelation
which
such
acknowledgment
would
give
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
spoke
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
Esther
,
the
sister
of
John
Barton
's
wife
?
<EOS>
the
aunt
to
Mary
?
 
<EOS>
And
the
valentine
I
sent
you
last
February
ten
years
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
mind
her
well
!
 
<EOS>
But
yo
are
not
Esther
,
are
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
looked
again
into
her
face
,
and
seeing
that
indeed
it
was
his
boyhood
's
friend
<EOS>
,
he
took
her
hand
,
and
shook
it
with
a
cordiality
that
forgot
the
present
in
the
past
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Esther
!
 
<EOS>
Where
han
ye
been
this
many
a
year
?
 
<EOS>
Where
han
ye
been
wandering
that
we
none
of
us
could
find
you
out
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
question
was
asked
thoughtlessly
,
but
answered
with
fierce
earnestness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
have
I
been
?
 
<EOS>
What
have
I
been
doing
?
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
torment
me
with
questions
like
these
?
 
<EOS>
Can
you
not
guess
?
 
<EOS>
But
the
story
of
my
life
is
wanted
to
give
force
to
my
speech
,
afterwards
I
will
tell
it
you
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
!
do
n't
change
your
fickle
mind
now
,
and
say
you
do
n't
want
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
hear
it
,
and
I
must
tell
it
;
and
then
see
after
Mary
,
and
take
care
<EOS>
she
does
not
become
like
me
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
is
loving
now
,
so
did
I
love
once
:
one
above
me
far
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
remarked
not
,
in
her
own
absorption
,
<EOS>
the
change
in
Jem
's
breathing
,
the
sudden
clutch
at
the
wall
which
told
the
fearfully
vivid
interest
he
took
in
what
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
so
handsome
,
so
kind
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
the
regiment
was
ordered
to
Chester
<EOS>
(
did
I
tell
you
he
was
an
officer
?
)
,
and
he
could
not
bear
to
part
from
me
,
nor
I
from
him
,
so
he
took
me
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
poor
Mary
would
have
taken
it
so
to
heart
!
 
<EOS>
I
always
meant
to
send
for
her
to
pay
me
a
visit
when
I
was
married
;
for
,
mark
you
!
<EOS>
he
promised
me
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
do
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
three
years
of
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
ought
not
to
have
been
happy
,
but
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
little
girl
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
the
sweetest
darling
that
ever
was
seen
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
not
think
of
her
,
"
putting
her
hand
wildly
up
to
her
forehead
,
"
or
I
shall
go
mad
;
I
shall
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
tell
me
any
more
about
yoursel
,
"
said
Jem
soothingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
you
're
tired
already
,
are
you
?
<EOS>
but
I
will
tell
you
;
as
you
've
asked
for
it
,
you
shall
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
recall
the
agony
of
the
past
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
have
the
relief
of
telling
it
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
happy
I
was
!
"
 
<EOS>
sinking
her
voice
into
a
plaintive
,
childlike
manner
.
<EOS>
"
It
went
like
a
shot
through
me
when
one
day
he
came
to
me
and
told
me
he
was
ordered
to
Ireland
,
and
must
leave
me
behind
;
at
Bristol
we
then
were
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
muttered
some
words
;
she
caught
their
meaning
,
and
in
a
pleading
voice
continued
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
abuse
him
;
do
n't
speak
a
word
against
him
!
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
how
I
love
him
yet
;
<EOS>
yet
,
when
I
am
sunk
so
low
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
guess
how
kind
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
me
fifty
pounds
before
we
parted
,
and
I
knew
he
could
ill
spare
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
,
Jem
,
please
,
"
as
his
muttered
indignation
rose
again
.
 
<EOS>
For
her
sake
he
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
might
have
done
better
with
the
money
;
I
see
now
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
did
not
know
the
value
of
it
then
.
 
<EOS>
Formerly
I
had
earned
it
easily
enough
at
the
factory
,
and
as
I
had
no
more
sensible
wants
,
I
spent
it
on
dress
and
on
eating
.
 
<EOS>
While
I
lived
with
him
,
I
had
it
for
asking
;
and
fifty
pounds
would
,
I
thought
,
go
a
long
way
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
went
back
to
Chester
,
where
I
'd
been
so
happy
,
and
set
up
a
small
-
ware
shop
,
and
hired
a
room
near
.
 
<EOS>
We
should
have
done
well
,
but
alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
my
little
girl
fell
ill
,
and
I
could
not
mind
my
shop
and
her
too
:
and
things
grew
worse
and
worse
.
 
<EOS>
I
sold
my
goods
anyhow
to
get
money
to
buy
her
food
and
medicine
;
I
wrote
over
and
over
again
to
her
father
for
help
,
but
he
must
have
changed
his
quarters
,
for
I
never
got
an
answer
.
 
<EOS>
The
landlord
seized
the
few
bobbins
and
tapes
I
had
left
,
for
shop
-
rent
;
and
the
person
to
whom
the
mean
little
room
,
to
which
we
had
been
forced
to
remove
,
belonged
,
threatened
to
turn
us
out
unless
his
rent
was
paid
;
it
had
run
on
many
weeks
,
and
it
was
winter
,
cold
bleak
winter
;
and
my
child
was
so
ill
,
so
ill
,
and
I
was
starving
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
could
not
bear
to
see
her
suffer
,
and
forgot
how
much
better
it
would
be
for
us
to
die
together
;
 
<EOS>
oh
,
her
moans
,
her
moans
,
which
money
could
give
the
means
of
relieving
!
 
<EOS>
So
I
went
out
into
the
street
one
January
night
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
God
will
punish
me
for
that
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
with
wild
vehemence
,
almost
amounting
to
insanity
,
and
shaking
Jem
's
arm
in
order
to
force
an
answer
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
before
he
could
shape
his
heart
's
sympathy
into
words
,
her
voice
had
lost
its
wildness
,
and
she
spoke
with
the
quiet
of
despair
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
no
matter
!
 
<EOS>
I
've
done
that
since
,
which
separates
us
as
far
asunder
as
heaven
and
hell
can
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
Her
voice
rose
again
to
the
sharp
pitch
of
agony
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
darling
!
<EOS>
my
darling
!
<EOS>
even
after
death
I
may
not
see
thee
,
my
own
sweet
one
!
<EOS>
she
was
so
good
 
<EOS>
like
a
little
angel
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
that
text
,
I
do
n't
remember
,
 
the
text
mother
used
to
teach
me
when
I
sat
on
her
knee
long
ago
;
it
begins
,
"
Blessed
are
the
pure
"
    
"
Blessed
are
the
pure
in
heart
,
for
they
shall
see
God
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
that
's
it
!
 
<EOS>
It
would
break
mother
's
heart
if
she
knew
what
I
am
now
 
it
did
break
Mary
's
heart
<EOS>
,
you
see
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
I
recollect
it
was
about
her
child
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
see
you
,
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
Mary
Barton
,
do
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
trying
to
collect
her
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
Jem
knew
her
.
 
<EOS>
How
well
,
his
beating
heart
could
testify
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
there
's
something
to
do
for
her
;
I
forget
what
;
wait
a
minute
!
 
<EOS>
She
is
so
like
my
little
girl
,
"
said
she
,
raising
her
eyes
glistening
with
unshed
tears
,
in
search
of
the
sympathy
of
Jem
's
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
He
deeply
pitied
her
;
but
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
he
longed
to
recall
her
mind
to
the
subject
of
Mary
,
and
the
lover
above
her
in
rank
,
and
the
service
to
be
done
for
her
sake
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
controlled
himself
to
silence
.
 
<EOS>
After
awhile
,
she
spoke
again
,
and
in
a
calmer
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
came
to
Manchester
(
for
I
could
not
stay
in
Chester
after
her
death
)
,
I
found
you
all
out
very
soon
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
I
never
thought
my
poor
sister
was
dead
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
would
not
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
used
to
watch
about
the
court
where
John
lived
,
for
many
and
many
a
night
,
and
gather
all
I
could
about
them
from
the
neighbours
'
talk
;
for
I
never
asked
a
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
this
and
that
together
,
and
followed
one
,
and
listened
to
another
;
many
's
the
time
I
've
watched
the
policeman
off
his
beat
,
and
peeped
through
the
chink
of
the
window
-
shutter
to
see
the
old
room
,
and
sometimes
Mary
or
her
father
sitting
up
late
for
some
reason
or
another
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
out
Mary
went
to
learn
dressmaking
,
and
<EOS>
I
began
to
be
frightened
for
her
;
for
it
's
a
bad
life
for
a
girl
to
be
out
late
at
night
in
the
streets
,
and
after
many
an
hour
of
weary
work
,
they
're
ready
to
follow
after
any
novelty
that
makes
a
little
change
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
made
up
my
mind
,
that
bad
as
I
was
<EOS>
,
I
could
watch
over
Mary
,
and
perhaps
keep
her
from
harm
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
used
to
wait
for
her
at
nights
,
and
follow
her
home
,
often
when
she
little
knew
any
one
was
near
her
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
one
of
her
companions
I
never
could
abide
,
and
I
'm
sure
that
girl
is
at
the
bottom
of
some
mischief
.
 
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
Mary
's
walks
homewards
were
not
alone
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
joined
soon
after
she
came
out
by
a
man
;
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
I
began
to
fear
for
her
,
for
I
saw
she
was
light
-
hearted
,
and
pleased
with
his
attentions
;
and
I
thought
worse
of
him
for
having
such
long
talks
with
that
bold
girl
<EOS>
I
told
you
of
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
laid
up
for
a
long
time
with
spitting
of
blood
;
and
could
do
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
it
made
made
me
worse
,
thinking
about
what
might
be
happening
to
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
came
out
,
all
was
going
on
as
before
,
only
she
seemed
fonder
of
him
than
ever
;
and
oh
!
<EOS>
Jem
,
her
father
wo
n't
listen
to
me
,
and
it
's
you
must
save
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
like
a
brother
to
her
,
and
maybe
could
give
her
advice
and
watch
over
her
,
and
at
any
rate
John
will
hearken
to
you
;
only
he
's
so
stern
,
and
so
cruel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
began
to
cry
a
little
at
the
remembrance
of
his
harsh
words
;
but
Jem
cut
her
short
by
his
hoarse
,
stern
inquiry
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
is
this
spark
that
Mary
loves
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
his
name
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
young
Carson
,
old
Carson
's
son
,
that
your
father
worked
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
She
broke
the
silence
   
<EOS>
"
O
Jem
,
I
charge
you
with
the
care
of
her
!
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
would
be
murder
to
kill
her
,
but
it
would
be
better
for
her
to
die
than
to
live
to
lead
such
a
life
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
me
,
Jem
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
hear
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
better
.
 
<EOS>
Better
we
were
all
dead
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
said
as
if
thinking
aloud
;
but
he
immediately
changed
his
tone
and
continued
   
<EOS>
"
Esther
,
you
may
trust
to
my
doing
all
I
can
for
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
have
determined
on
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
listen
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
loathe
the
life
you
lead
,
else
you
would
not
speak
of
it
as
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
Come
home
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Come
to
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
She
and
my
aunt
Alice
live
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
see
that
they
give
you
a
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
-
morrow
I
will
see
if
some
honest
way
of
living
can
not
be
found
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
Come
home
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
silent
for
a
minute
,
and
he
hoped
he
had
gained
his
point
.
<EOS>
Then
she
said
   
"
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
Jem
,
for
the
words
you
have
just
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
Some
years
ago
you
might
have
saved
me
,
as
I
hope
and
trust
<EOS>
you
will
yet
save
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
it
is
too
late
now
;
 
too
late
,
"
she
added
,
with
accents
of
deep
despair
.
  
<EOS>
Still
he
did
not
relax
his
hold
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
home
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
I
can
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
lead
a
virtuous
life
if
I
would
.
<EOS>
I
should
only
disgrace
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
will
know
all
,
"
said
she
,
as
he
still
seemed
inclined
to
urge
her
,
"
I
must
have
drink
.
 
<EOS>
Such
as
live
like
me
could
not
bear
life
if
they
did
not
drink
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
only
thing
to
keep
us
from
suicide
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
did
not
drink
,
we
could
not
stand
the
memory
of
what
we
have
been
,
and
the
thought
of
what
we
are
,
for
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
go
without
food
,
and
without
shelter
,
I
must
have
my
dram
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
do
n't
know
the
awful
nights
I
have
had
in
prison
for
want
of
it
,
"
said
she
,
shuddering
,
and
glaring
round
with
terrified
eyes
,
as
if
dreading
to
see
some
spiritual
creature
,
with
dim
form
,
near
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
frightful
to
see
them
,
"
whispering
in
tones
of
wildness
,
although
so
low
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
they
go
round
and
round
my
bed
the
whole
night
through
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
,
carrying
little
Annie
(
I
wonder
how
they
got
together
)
and
Mary
 
and
all
looking
at
me
with
their
sad
,
stony
eyes
;
O
Jem
!
<EOS>
it
is
so
terrible
!
 
<EOS>
They
do
n't
turn
back
either
,
but
pass
behind
the
head
of
the
bed
,
and
I
feel
their
eyes
on
me
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
creep
under
the
clothes
I
still
see
them
;
and
what
is
worse
,
"
hissing
out
her
words
with
fright
,
"
they
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
speak
to
me
of
leading
a
better
life
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
drink
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
pass
to
-
night
without
a
dram
;
I
dare
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
was
silent
from
deep
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
could
he
,
then
,
do
nothing
for
her
!
 
<EOS>
She
spoke
again
,
but
in
a
less
excited
tone
,
although
it
was
thrillingly
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
grieved
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
better
than
if
you
told
me
in
words
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
can
do
nothing
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
past
hope
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
yet
save
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
innocent
,
except
for
the
great
error
of
loving
one
above
her
in
station
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
!
<EOS>
you
WILL
save
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
With
heart
and
soul
,
though
in
few
words
,
Jem
promised
that
if
aught
earthly
could
keep
her
from
falling
,
he
would
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
blessed
him
,
and
bade
him
good
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
a
minute
,
"
said
he
,
as
she
was
on
the
point
of
departure
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
may
want
to
speak
to
you
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
mun
know
where
to
find
you
 
where
do
you
live
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
laughed
strangely
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
think
one
sunk
so
low
as
I
am
has
a
home
?
 
<EOS>
Decent
,
good
people
have
homes
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
none
.
 
<EOS>
No
;
if
you
want
me
,
come
at
night
and
look
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
about
here
.
 
<EOS>
The
colder
,
the
bleaker
,
the
more
stormy
the
night
,
the
more
certain
you
will
be
to
find
me
.
 
<EOS>
For
then
,
"
she
added
,
with
a
plaintive
fall
in
her
voice
,
"
it
is
so
cold
sleeping
in
entries
,
and
on
door
-
steps
,
and
I
want
a
dram
more
than
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Again
she
rapidly
turned
off
,
and
Jem
also
went
on
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
But
before
he
reached
the
end
of
the
street
,
even
in
the
midst
of
the
jealous
anguish
that
filled
his
heart
,
his
conscience
smote
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
done
enough
to
save
her
.
 
<EOS>
One
more
effort
,
and
she
might
have
come
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
twenty
efforts
would
have
been
well
rewarded
by
her
yielding
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
back
,
but
she
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
tumult
of
his
other
feelings
,
his
self
-
reproach
was
deadened
for
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
But
many
and
many
a
day
afterwards
he
bitterly
regretted
his
omission
of
duty
;
his
weariness
of
well
-
doing
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
the
great
thing
was
to
reach
home
,
and
solitude
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
loved
another
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
should
he
bear
it
?
 
<EOS>
He
had
thought
her
rejection
of
him
a
hard
trial
,
but
that
was
nothing
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
remembered
it
,
to
be
thankful
that
he
had
not
yielded
to
the
temptation
of
trying
his
fate
again
,
not
in
actual
words
,
but
in
a
meeting
,
where
her
manner
should
tell
far
more
than
words
,
that
her
sweet
smiles
,
her
dainty
movements
,
her
pretty
household
ways
,
were
all
to
be
reserved
to
gladden
another
's
eyes
and
heart
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
must
live
on
;
that
seemed
the
strangest
.
 
<EOS>
That
a
long
life
(
and
he
knew
men
did
live
long
,
even
with
deep
,
biting
sorrow
corroding
at
their
hearts
)
must
be
spent
without
Mary
;
nay
,
with
the
consciousness
<EOS>
she
was
another
's
!
 
<EOS>
That
hell
of
thought
he
would
reserve
for
the
quiet
of
his
own
room
,
the
dead
stillness
of
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
on
the
threshold
of
home
now
.
  
<EOS>
He
entered
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
the
usual
faces
,
the
usual
sights
.
 
<EOS>
He
loathed
them
,
and
then
he
cursed
himself
because
he
loathed
them
.
<EOS>
His
mother
's
love
had
taken
a
cross
turn
,
because
he
had
kept
the
tempting
supper
she
had
prepared
for
him
waiting
until
it
was
nearly
spoilt
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
,
her
dulled
senses
deadening
day
by
day
,
sat
mutely
near
the
fire
:
<EOS>
her
happiness
bounded
by
the
consciousness
of
the
presence
of
her
foster
-
child
,
knowing
that
his
voice
repeated
what
was
passing
to
her
deafened
ear
,
that
his
arm
removed
each
little
obstacle
to
her
tottering
steps
.
 
<EOS>
And
Will
,
out
of
the
very
kindness
of
his
heart
,
talked
more
and
more
merrily
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
Jem
was
downcast
,
and
fancied
his
rattling
might
cheer
him
;
at
any
rate
,
it
drowned
his
aunt
's
muttered
grumblings
,
and
in
some
measure
concealed
the
blank
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
bed
-
time
came
;
and
Will
withdrew
to
his
neighbouring
lodging
;
and
Jane
and
Alice
Wilson
had
raked
the
fire
,
and
fastened
doors
and
shutters
,
and
pattered
upstairs
,
with
their
tottering
footsteps
and
shrill
voices
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
,
too
,
went
to
the
closet
termed
his
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
bolt
to
the
door
;
but
by
one
strong
effort
of
his
right
arm
a
heavy
chest
was
moved
against
it
,
and
he
could
sit
down
on
the
side
of
his
bed
,
and
think
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
loved
another
!
 
<EOS>
That
idea
would
rise
uppermost
in
his
mind
,
and
had
to
be
combated
in
all
its
forms
of
pain
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
,
perhaps
,
no
great
wonder
that
she
should
prefer
one
so
much
above
Jem
in
the
external
things
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
gentleman
;
why
did
he
,
with
his
range
of
choice
among
the
ladies
of
the
land
,
why
did
he
stoop
down
to
carry
off
the
poor
man
's
darling
?
 
<EOS>
With
all
the
glories
of
the
garden
at
his
hand
,
why
did
he
prefer
to
cull
the
wild
-
rose
,
 
Jem
's
own
fragrant
wild
-
rose
?
  
<EOS>
His
OWN
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
never
now
his
own
!
 
<EOS>
Gone
for
evermore
.
  
<EOS>
Then
uprose
the
guilty
longing
for
blood
!
 
<EOS>
the
frenzy
of
jealousy
!
 
<EOS>
Some
one
should
die
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
rather
Mary
were
dead
,
cold
in
her
grave
,
than
that
she
were
another
's
.
 
<EOS>
A
vision
of
her
pale
,
sweet
face
,
with
her
bright
hair
all
bedabbled
with
gore
,
seemed
to
float
constantly
before
his
aching
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
But
hers
were
ever
open
,
and
contained
,
in
their
soft
,
deathly
look
,
such
mute
reproach
!
 
<EOS>
What
had
she
done
to
deserve
such
cruel
treatment
from
him
?
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
wooed
by
one
whom
Jem
knew
to
be
handsome
,
gay
,
and
bright
,
and
she
had
given
him
her
love
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
all
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
wooer
who
should
die
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
die
,
knowing
the
cause
of
his
death
.
<EOS>
Jem
pictured
him
(
and
gloated
on
the
picture
)
,
lying
smitten
,
yet
conscious
;
and
listening
to
the
upbraiding
accusation
of
his
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
How
he
had
left
his
own
rank
,
and
dared
to
love
a
maiden
of
low
degree
!
<EOS>
and
oh
!
stinging
agony
of
all
 
how
she
,
in
return
,
had
loved
him
!
 
<EOS>
Then
the
other
nature
spoke
up
,
and
bade
him
<EOS>
remember
the
anguish
he
should
so
prepare
for
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
At
first
he
refused
to
listen
to
that
better
voice
;
or
listened
only
to
pervert
.
<EOS>
He
would
glory
in
her
wailing
grief
!
<EOS>
he
would
take
pleasure
in
her
desolation
of
heart
!
  
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
he
could
not
,
said
the
still
small
voice
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
worse
,
far
worse
,
to
have
caused
such
woe
,
than
it
was
now
to
bear
his
present
heavy
burden
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
too
heavy
,
too
grievous
to
be
borne
,
and
live
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
slay
himself
and
the
lovers
should
love
on
,
and
the
sun
shine
bright
,
and
he
with
his
burning
,
woeful
heart
would
be
at
rest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rest
that
is
reserved
for
the
people
of
God
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Had
he
not
promised
,
with
such
earnest
purpose
of
soul
as
makes
words
more
solemn
than
oaths
,
to
save
Mary
from
becoming
such
as
Esther
?
 
<EOS>
Should
he
shrink
from
the
duties
of
life
,
into
the
cowardliness
of
death
?
 
<EOS>
Who
would
then
guard
Mary
,
with
her
love
and
her
innocence
?
 
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
a
goodly
thing
to
serve
her
,
although
she
loved
him
not
;
to
be
her
preserving
angel
,
through
the
perils
of
life
;
and
she
,
unconscious
all
the
while
?
  
<EOS>
He
braced
up
his
soul
,
and
said
to
himself
,
that
with
God
's
help
he
would
be
that
earthly
keeper
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
the
mists
and
the
storms
seemed
clearing
away
from
his
path
,
though
it
still
was
full
of
stinging
thorns
.
 
<EOS>
Having
done
the
duty
nearest
to
him
(
of
reducing
the
tumult
of
his
own
heart
to
something
like
order
)
,
the
second
became
more
plain
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Esther
's
experience
had
led
her
,
perhaps
too
hastily
,
to
the
conclusion
that
Mr.
Carson
's
intentions
were
evil
towards
Mary
;
at
least
she
had
given
no
just
ground
for
the
fears
she
entertained
<EOS>
that
such
was
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
possible
,
nay
,
to
Jem
's
heart
very
probable
,
that
he
might
only
be
too
happy
to
marry
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
lady
by
right
of
nature
,
<EOS>
Jem
thought
;
in
movement
,
grace
,
and
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
birth
to
a
Manchester
manufacturer
,
many
of
whom
glory
,
and
justly
too
,
in
being
the
architects
of
their
own
fortunes
?
 
<EOS>
And
,
as
far
as
wealth
was
concerned
,
judging
another
by
himself
,
Jem
could
only
imagine
it
a
great
privilege
to
lay
it
at
the
feet
of
the
loved
one
.
 
<EOS>
Harry
Carson
's
mother
had
been
a
factory
girl
;
<EOS>
so
,
after
all
,
what
was
the
great
reason
for
doubting
his
intentions
towards
Mary
?
  
<EOS>
There
might
probably
be
some
little
awkwardness
about
the
affair
at
first
;
Mary
's
father
having
such
strong
prejudices
on
the
one
hand
;
and
something
of
the
same
kind
being
likely
to
exist
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Carson
's
family
.
 
<EOS>
But
Jem
knew
he
had
power
over
John
Barton
's
mind
;
and
it
would
be
something
to
exert
that
power
in
promoting
Mary
's
happiness
,
and
to
relinquish
all
thought
of
self
in
so
doing
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
why
had
Esther
chosen
him
for
this
office
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
beyond
his
strength
to
act
rightly
!
 
<EOS>
Why
had
she
singled
him
out
?
  
<EOS>
The
answer
came
when
he
was
calm
enough
to
listen
for
it
:
Because
Mary
had
no
other
friend
capable
of
the
duty
required
of
him
;
the
duty
of
a
brother
,
as
Esther
imagined
him
to
be
in
feeling
,
from
his
long
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
be
unto
her
as
a
brother
.
  
<EOS>
As
such
,
he
ought
to
ascertain
Harry
Carson
's
intentions
towards
her
in
winning
her
affections
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
ask
him
straightforwardly
,
as
became
man
speaking
to
man
,
not
concealing
,
if
need
were
,
the
interest
he
felt
in
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
with
the
resolve
to
do
his
duty
to
the
best
of
his
power
,
peace
came
into
his
soul
;
he
had
left
the
windy
storm
and
tempest
behind
.
  
<EOS>
Two
hours
before
day
-
dawn
he
fell
asleep
.

A
VIOLENT
MEETING
BETWEEN
THE
RIVALS

"
What
thoughtful
heart
can
look
into
this
gulf
<EOS>
That
darkly
yawns
'
twixt
rich
and
poor
,
And
not
find
food
for
saddest
meditation

<EOS>
Can
see
,
without
a
pang
of
keenest
grief
,
Them
fiercely
battling
(
like
some
natural
foes

Whom
God

made

with

and
sympathy

To

Where
is
the

that
shall
bridge
this

And

<EOS>
We
must
return
to
John
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
John
!
 
<EOS>
He
never
got
over
his
disappointing
journey
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
The
deep
mortification
he
then
experienced
(
with
,
perhaps
,
as
little
selfishness
for
its
cause
as
mortification
ever
had
)
was
of
no
temporary
nature
;
indeed
,
few
of
his
feelings
were
.
  
<EOS>
Then
came
a
long
period
of
bodily
privation
;
of
daily
hunger
after
food
;
and
though
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
he
could
bear
want
himself
with
stoical
indifference
,
and
did
care
about
it
as
little
as
most
men
,
yet
the
body
took
its
revenge
for
its
uneasy
feelings
.
<EOS>
The
mind
became
soured
and
morose
,
and
lost
much
of
its
equipoise
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
longer
elastic
,
as
in
the
days
of
youth
,
or
in
times
of
comparative
happiness
;
it
ceased
to
hope
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
is
hard
to
live
on
when
one
can
no
longer
hope
.
  
<EOS>
The
same
state
of
feeling
which
John
Barton
entertained
,
if
belonging
to
one
who
had
had
leisure
to
think
of
such
things
,
and
physicians
to
give
names
to
them
,
would
have
been
called
monomania
;
so
haunting
,
so
incessant
,
were
the
thoughts
that
pressed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
somewhere
read
a
forcibly
described
punishment
among
the
Italians
,
worthy
of
a
Borgia
.
 
<EOS>
The
supposed
or
real
criminal
was
shut
up
in
a
room
,
supplied
with
every
convenience
and
luxury
;
and
at
first
mourned
little
over
his
imprisonment
.
 
<EOS>
But
day
by
day
he
became
aware
that
the
space
between
the
walls
of
his
apartment
was
narrowing
,
and
then
he
understood
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
Those
painted
walls
would
come
into
hideous
nearness
,
and
at
last
crush
the
life
out
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
day
by
day
,
nearer
and
nearer
,
came
the
diseased
thoughts
of
John
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
They
excluded
the
light
of
heaven
,
the
cheering
sounds
of
earth
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
preparing
his
death
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
true
much
of
their
morbid
power
might
be
ascribed
to
the
use
of
opium
.
 
<EOS>
But
before
you
blame
too
harshly
this
use
,
or
rather
abuse
,
try
a
hopeless
life
,
with
daily
cravings
of
the
body
for
food
.
 
<EOS>
Try
,
not
alone
being
without
hope
yourself
,
but
seeing
all
around
you
reduced
to
the
same
despair
,
arising
from
the
same
circumstances
;
all
around
you
telling
(
though
they
use
no
words
or
language
)
,
by
their
looks
and
feeble
actions
,
that
they
are
suffering
and
sinking
under
the
pressure
of
want
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
not
be
glad
to
forget
life
,
and
its
burdens
?
 
<EOS>
And
opium
gives
forgetfulness
for
a
time
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
true
they
who
thus
purchase
it
pay
dearly
for
their
oblivion
;
but
can
you
expect
the
uneducated
to
count
the
cost
of
their
whistle
?
 
<EOS>
Poor
wretches
!
 
<EOS>
They
pay
a
heavy
price
.
 
<EOS>
Days
of
oppressive
weariness
and
languor
,
whose
realities
have
the
feeble
sickliness
of
dreams
<EOS>
;
nights
,
whose
dreams
are
fierce
realities
of
agony
;
sinking
health
,
tottering
frames
,
incipient
madness
,
and
worse
,
the
CONSCIOUSNESS
of
incipient
madness
;
this
is
the
price
of
their
whistle
.
 
<EOS>
But
have
you
taught
them
the
science
of
consequences
?
  
<EOS>
John
Barton
's
overpowering
thought
,
which
was
to
work
out
his
fate
on
earth
,
was
rich
and
poor
;
why
are
they
so
separate
<EOS>
,
so
distinct
,
when
God
has
made
them
all
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
His
will
that
their
interests
are
so
far
apart
.
 
<EOS>
Whose
doing
is
it
?
  
<EOS>
And
so
on
into
the
problems
and
mysteries
of
life
,
until
,
bewildered
and
lost
,
unhappy
and
suffering
,
the
only
feeling
that
remained
clear
and
undisturbed
in
the
tumult
of
his
heart
,
was
hatred
to
the
one
class
,
and
keen
sympathy
with
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
availed
his
sympathy
?
 
<EOS>
No
education
had
given
him
wisdom
;
and
without
wisdom
,
even
love
,
with
all
its
effects
,
too
often
works
but
harm
.
 
<EOS>
He
acted
to
the
best
of
his
judgment
,
but
it
was
a
widely
-
erring
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
The
actions
of
the
uneducated
seem
to
me
typified
in
those
of
Frankenstein
,
that
monster
of
many
human
qualities
,
ungifted
with
a
soul
,
a
knowledge
of
the
difference
between
good
and
evil
.
  
<EOS>
The
people
rise
up
to
life
;
they
irritate
us
,
they
terrify
us
,
and
we
become
their
enemies
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
in
the
sorrowful
moment
of
our
triumphant
power
,
their
eyes
gaze
on
us
with
mute
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
Why
have
we
made
them
what
they
are
;
a
powerful
monster
,
yet
without
the
inner
means
for
peace
and
happiness
?
  
<EOS>
John
Barton
became
a
Chartist
,
a
Communist
,
all
that
is
commonly
called
wild
and
visionary
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
!
<EOS>
but
being
visionary
is
something
.
<EOS>
It
shows
a
soul
,
a
being
not
altogether
sensual
;
a
creature
who
looks
forward
for
others
,
if
not
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
And
with
all
his
weakness
he
had
a
sort
of
practical
power
,
which
made
him
useful
to
the
bodies
of
men
to
whom
he
belonged
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
ready
kind
of
rough
Lancashire
eloquence
,
arising
out
of
the
fulness
of
his
heart
,
which
was
very
stirring
to
men
similarly
circumstanced
,
who
liked
to
hear
their
feelings
put
into
words
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
pretty
clear
head
at
times
,
for
method
and
arrangement
;
a
necessary
talent
to
large
combinations
of
men
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
perhaps
more
than
all
made
him
relied
upon
and
valued
,
was
the
consciousness
which
every
one
who
came
in
contact
with
him
felt
,
that
he
was
actuated
by
no
selfish
motives
;
that
his
class
,
his
order
,
was
what
he
stood
by
,
not
the
rights
of
his
own
paltry
self
.
 
<EOS>
For
even
in
great
and
noble
men
,
as
soon
as
self
comes
into
prominent
existence
,
it
becomes
a
mean
and
paltry
thing
.
  
<EOS>
A
little
time
before
this
,
there
had
come
one
of
those
occasions
for
deliberation
among
the
employed
,
which
deeply
interested
John
Barton
,
and
the
discussions
concerning
which
had
caused
his
frequent
absence
from
home
of
late
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
if
I
can
express
myself
in
the
technical
terms
of
either
masters
or
workmen
,
but
I
will
try
simply
to
state
the
case
on
which
the
latter
deliberated
.
  
<EOS>
An
order
for
coarse
goods
came
in
from
a
new
foreign
market
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
large
order
,
giving
employment
to
all
the
mills
engaged
in
that
species
of
manufacture
;
but
it
was
necessary
to
execute
it
speedily
,
and
at
as
low
prices
as
possible
,
as
the
masters
had
reason
to
believe
that
a
duplicate
order
had
been
sent
to
one
of
the
continental
manufacturing
towns
,
where
there
were
no
restrictions
on
food
,
no
taxes
on
building
or
machinery
,
and
where
consequently
they
dreaded
that
the
goods
could
be
made
at
a
much
lower
price
than
they
could
afford
them
for
;
and
that
,
by
so
acting
and
charging
,
the
rival
manufacturers
would
obtain
undivided
possession
of
the
market
.
<EOS>
It
was
clearly
their
interest
to
buy
cotton
as
cheaply
,
and
to
beat
down
wages
as
low
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
the
long
run
the
interests
of
the
workmen
would
have
been
thereby
benefited
.
 
<EOS>
Distrust
each
other
as
they
may
,
the
employers
and
the
employed
must
rise
or
fall
together
.
 
<EOS>
There
may
be
some
difference
as
to
chronology
,
none
as
to
fact
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
masters
did
not
choose
to
make
all
these
circumstances
known
.
 
<EOS>
They
stood
upon
being
the
masters
,
and
that
they
had
a
right
to
order
work
at
their
own
prices
,
and
they
believed
that
in
the
present
depression
of
trade
,
and
unemployment
of
hands
,
there
would
be
no
great
difficulty
in
getting
it
done
.
  
<EOS>
Now
let
us
turn
to
the
workmen
's
view
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
The
masters
(
of
the
tottering
foundation
of
whose
prosperity
they
were
ignorant
)
seemed
doing
well
,
and
,
like
gentlemen
,
"
lived
at
home
in
ease
,
"
while
they
were
starving
,
gasping
on
from
day
to
day
;
and
there
was
a
foreign
order
to
be
executed
,
the
extent
of
which
,
large
as
it
was
,
was
greatly
exaggerated
;
and
it
was
to
be
done
speedily
.
 
<EOS>
Why
were
the
masters
offering
such
low
wages
under
these
circumstances
?
<EOS>
Shame
upon
them
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
taking
advantage
of
their
workpeople
being
almost
starved
;
but
they
would
starve
entirely
rather
than
come
into
such
terms
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
bad
enough
to
be
poor
,
while
by
the
labour
of
their
thin
hands
,
the
sweat
of
their
brows
,
the
masters
were
made
rich
;
but
they
would
not
be
utterly
ground
down
to
dust
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
they
would
fold
their
hands
and
sit
idle
,
and
smile
at
the
masters
,
whom
even
in
death
they
could
baffle
.
 
<EOS>
With
Spartan
endurance
they
determined
to
let
the
employers
know
their
power
,
by
refusing
to
work
.
  
<EOS>
So
class
distrusted
class
,
and
their
want
of
mutual
confidence
wrought
sorrow
to
both
.
 
<EOS>
The
masters
would
not
be
bullied
,
and
compelled
to
reveal
why
they
felt
it
wisest
and
best
to
offer
only
such
low
wages
;
they
would
not
be
made
to
tell
that
they
were
even
sacrificing
capital
to
obtain
a
decisive
victory
over
the
continental
manufacturers
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
workmen
sat
silent
and
stern
with
folded
hands
,
refusing
to
work
for
such
pay
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
strike
in
Manchester
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
it
was
succeeded
by
the
usual
consequences
.
 
<EOS>
Many
other
Trades
'
Unions
,
connected
with
different
branches
of
business
,
supported
with
money
,
countenance
,
and
encouragement
of
every
kind
,
the
stand
which
the
Manchester
power
-
loom
weavers
were
making
against
their
masters
.
 
<EOS>
Delegates
from
Glasgow
,
from
Nottingham
,
and
other
towns
,
were
sent
to
Manchester
,
to
keep
up
the
spirit
of
resistance
;
a
committee
was
formed
,
and
all
the
requisite
officers
elected
;
chairman
,
treasurer
,
honorary
secretary
;
 
among
them
was
John
Barton
.
  
<EOS>
The
masters
,
meanwhile
,
took
their
measures
.
 
<EOS>
They
placarded
the
walls
with
advertisements
for
power
-
loom
weavers
.
 
<EOS>
The
workmen
replied
by
a
placard
in
still
larger
letters
,
stating
their
grievances
.
 
<EOS>
The
masters
met
daily
in
town
,
to
mourn
over
the
time
(
so
fast
slipping
away
)
for
the
fulfilment
of
the
foreign
orders
;
and
to
strengthen
each
other
in
their
resolution
not
to
yield
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
gave
up
now
,
they
might
give
up
always
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
never
do
.
<EOS>
And
amongst
the
most
energetic
of
the
masters
,
the
Carsons
,
father
and
son
,
took
their
places
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
well
known
,
that
there
is
no
religionist
so
zealous
as
a
convert
;
no
masters
so
stern
,
and
regardless
of
the
interests
of
their
workpeople
,
as
those
who
have
risen
from
such
a
station
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
This
would
account
for
the
elder
Mr.
Carson
's
determination
not
to
be
bullied
into
yielding
;
not
even
to
be
bullied
into
giving
reasons
for
acting
as
the
masters
did
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
employers
'
will
,
and
that
should
be
enough
for
the
employed
.
 
<EOS>
Harry
Carson
did
not
trouble
himself
much
about
the
grounds
for
his
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
He
liked
the
excitement
of
the
affair
.
 
<EOS>
He
liked
the
attitude
of
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
brave
,
and
he
liked
the
idea
of
personal
danger
,
with
which
some
of
the
more
cautious
tried
to
intimidate
the
violent
among
the
masters
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
power
-
loom
weavers
living
in
the
more
remote
parts
of
Lancashire
,
and
the
neighbouring
counties
,
heard
of
the
masters
'
advertisements
for
workmen
;
and
in
their
solitary
dwellings
grew
weary
of
starvation
,
and
resolved
to
come
to
Manchester
.
 
<EOS>
Foot
-
sore
,
way
-
worn
,
half
-
starved
looking
men
they
were
,
as
they
tried
to
steal
into
town
in
the
early
dawn
,
before
people
were
astir
,
or
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
began
the
real
wrong
-
doing
of
the
Trades
'
Unions
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
their
decision
to
work
,
or
not
,
at
such
a
particular
rate
of
wages
,
that
was
either
wise
or
unwise
;
all
error
of
judgment
at
the
worst
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
had
no
right
to
tyrannise
over
others
,
and
tie
them
down
to
their
own
Procrustean
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Abhorring
what
they
considered
oppression
in
the
masters
,
why
did
they
oppress
others
?
 
<EOS>
Because
,
when
men
get
excited
,
they
know
not
what
they
do
.
<EOS>
Judge
,
then
,
with
something
of
the
mercy
of
the
Holy
One
,
whom
we
all
love
.
  
<EOS>
In
spite
of
policemen
set
to
watch
over
the
safety
of
the
poor
country
weavers
 
in
spite
of
magistrates
,
and
prisons
,
and
severe
punishments
 
<EOS>
the
poor
depressed
men
tramping
in
from
Burnley
,
Padiham
,
and
other
places
,
to
work
at
the
condemned
"
Starvation
Prices
,
"
were
waylaid
,
and
beaten
,
and
left
by
the
roadside
almost
for
dead
.
 
<EOS>
The
police
broke
up
every
lounging
knot
of
men
:
 
<EOS>
they
separated
quietly
,
to
reunite
half
-
a
-
mile
out
of
town
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
the
feeling
between
the
masters
and
workmen
did
not
improve
under
these
circumstances
.
  
<EOS>
Combination
is
an
awful
power
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
like
the
equally
mighty
agency
of
steam
;
capable
of
almost
unlimited
good
or
evil
.
 
<EOS>
But
to
obtain
a
blessing
on
its
labours
,
it
must
work
under
the
direction
of
a
high
and
intelligent
will
;
incapable
of
being
misled
by
passion
or
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
The
will
of
the
operatives
had
not
been
guided
to
the
calmness
of
wisdom
.
  
<EOS>
So
much
for
generalities
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
now
return
to
individuals
.
  
<EOS>
A
note
,
respectfully
worded
,
although
its
tone
of
determination
was
strong
,
had
been
sent
by
the
power
-
loom
weavers
,
requesting
that
a
"
deputation
"
of
them
might
have
a
meeting
with
the
masters
,
to
state
the
conditions
they
must
have
fulfilled
before
they
would
end
the
turn
-
out
.
 
<EOS>
They
thought
they
had
attained
a
sufficiently
commanding
position
to
dictate
.
 
<EOS>
John
Barton
was
appointed
one
of
the
deputation
.
  
<EOS>
The
masters
agreed
to
this
meeting
,
being
anxious
to
end
the
strife
,
although
undetermined
among
themselves
how
far
they
should
yield
,
or
whether
they
should
yield
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
old
,
whose
experience
had
taught
them
sympathy
,
were
for
concession
.
 
<EOS>
Others
,
white
-
headed
men
too
,
had
only
learnt
hardness
and
obstinacy
from
the
days
of
the
years
of
their
lives
,
and
sneered
at
the
more
gentle
and
yielding
.
<EOS>
The
younger
men
were
one
and
all
for
an
unflinching
resistance
to
claims
urged
with
so
much
violence
.
 
<EOS>
Of
this
party
<EOS>
Harry
Carson
was
the
leader
.
  
<EOS>
But
like
all
energetic
people
,
the
more
he
had
to
do
the
more
time
he
seemed
to
find
.
 
<EOS>
With
all
his
letter
-
writing
,
his
calling
,
his
being
present
at
the
New
Bailey
,
when
investigations
of
any
case
of
violence
against
knob
-
sticks
*
were
going
on
,
he
beset
Mary
more
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
weary
of
her
life
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
From
blandishments
he
had
even
gone
to
threats
 
threats
that
whether
she
would
or
not
she
should
be
his
;
he
showed
an
indifference
that
was
most
insulting
to
everything
which
might
attract
attention
and
injure
her
character
.
     
<EOS>
And
still
she
never
saw
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
he
had
returned
home
.
 
<EOS>
She
heard
of
him
occasionally
through
his
cousin
,
who
roved
gaily
from
house
to
house
,
finding
and
making
friends
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
never
saw
him
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
she
to
think
?
 
<EOS>
Had
he
given
her
up
?
 
<EOS>
Were
a
few
hasty
words
,
spoken
in
a
moment
of
irritation
,
to
stamp
her
lot
through
life
?
 
<EOS>
At
times
she
thought
that
she
could
bear
this
meekly
,
happy
in
her
own
constant
power
of
loving
.
 
<EOS>
For
of
change
or
of
forgetfulness
<EOS>
she
did
not
dream
.
 
<EOS>
Then
at
other
times
her
state
of
impatience
was
such
,
that
it
required
all
her
self
-
restraint
to
prevent
her
from
going
and
seeking
him
out
,
and
(
as
man
would
do
to
man
,
or
woman
to
woman
)
begging
him
to
forgive
her
hasty
words
,
and
allow
her
to
retract
them
,
and
bidding
him
accept
of
the
love
that
was
filling
her
whole
heart
.
 
<EOS>
She
wished
Margaret
had
not
advised
her
against
such
a
manner
of
proceeding
;
she
believed
it
was
her
friend
's
words
that
seemed
to
make
such
a
simple
action
impossible
,
in
spite
of
all
the
internal
urgings
.
 
<EOS>
But
a
friend
's
advice
is
only
thus
powerful
,
when
it
puts
into
language
the
secret
oracle
of
our
souls
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
whisperings
of
her
womanly
nature
that
caused
her
to
shrink
from
any
unmaidenly
action
,
not
Margaret
's
counsel
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
this
ten
days
or
so
,
of
Will
's
visit
to
Manchester
,
there
was
something
going
on
which
interested
Mary
even
now
,
and
which
,
in
former
times
,
would
have
exceedingly
amused
and
excited
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
saw
as
clearly
as
if
told
in
words
,
that
the
merry
,
random
,
boisterous
sailor
had
fallen
deeply
in
love
with
the
quiet
,
prim
,
somewhat
plain
Margaret
:
she
doubted
if
Margaret
was
aware
of
it
,
and
yet
,
as
she
watched
more
closely
,
she
began
to
think
some
instinct
made
the
blind
girl
feel
whose
eyes
were
so
often
fixed
upon
her
pale
face
;
that
some
inner
feeling
made
the
delicate
and
becoming
rose
-
flush
steal
over
her
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
speak
so
decidedly
as
before
;
there
was
a
hesitation
in
her
manner
,
that
seemed
to
make
her
very
attractive
;
as
if
something
softer
,
more
lovable
than
excellent
sense
,
were
coming
in
as
a
motive
for
speech
;
her
eyes
had
always
been
soft
,
and
were
in
no
ways
disfigured
by
her
blindness
,
and
now
seemed
to
have
a
new
charm
,
as
they
quivered
under
their
white
,
downcast
lids
.
 
<EOS>
She
must
be
conscious
,
thought
Mary
 
heart
answering
to
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Will
's
love
had
no
blushings
,
no
downcast
eyes
,
no
weighing
of
words
;
it
was
as
open
and
undisguised
as
his
nature
;
yet
he
seemed
afraid
of
the
answer
its
acknowledgment
might
meet
with
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Margaret
's
angelic
voice
that
had
entranced
him
,
and
which
made
him
think
of
her
as
a
being
of
some
other
sphere
,
that
he
feared
to
woo
.
<EOS>
So
he
tried
to
propitiate
Job
in
all
manner
of
ways
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
over
to
Liverpool
to
rummage
in
his
great
sea
-
chest
for
the
flying
-
fish
(
no
very
odorous
present
,
by
the
way
)
.
 
<EOS>
He
hesitated
over
a
child
's
caul
for
some
time
,
which
was
,
in
his
eyes
,
a
far
greater
treasure
than
any
Exocetus
.
 
<EOS>
What
use
could
it
be
of
to
a
landsman
?
 
<EOS>
Then
Margaret
's
voice
rang
in
his
ears
;
and
he
determined
to
sacrifice
it
,
his
most
precious
possession
,
to
one
whom
she
loved
as
she
did
her
grandfather
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
rather
a
relief
to
him
,
when
,
having
put
it
and
the
flying
-
fish
together
in
a
brown
paper
parcel
,
and
sat
upon
them
for
security
all
the
way
in
the
railroad
,
he
found
that
Job
was
so
indifferent
to
the
precious
caul
that
he
might
easily
claim
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
hung
about
Margaret
,
till
he
had
received
many
warnings
and
reproaches
from
his
conscience
in
behalf
of
his
dear
aunt
Alice
's
claims
upon
his
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
away
,
and
then
he
bethought
him
of
some
other
little
word
with
Job
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
turned
back
,
and
stood
talking
once
more
in
Margaret
's
presence
,
door
in
hand
,
only
waiting
for
some
little
speech
of
encouragement
to
come
in
and
sit
down
again
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
the
invitation
was
not
given
,
he
was
forced
to
leave
at
last
,
and
go
and
do
his
duty
.
  
<EOS>
Four
days
had
Jem
Wilson
watched
for
Mr.
Harry
Carson
without
success
;
his
hours
of
going
and
returning
to
his
home
were
so
irregular
,
owing
to
the
meetings
and
consultations
among
the
masters
,
which
were
rendered
necessary
by
the
turn
-
out
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
fifth
,
without
any
purpose
on
Jem
's
part
,
they
met
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
workmen
's
dinner
-
hour
,
the
interval
between
twelve
and
one
;
when
the
streets
of
Manchester
are
comparatively
quiet
,
for
a
few
shopping
ladies
and
lounging
gentlemen
count
for
nothing
in
that
busy
,
bustling
,
living
place
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
had
been
on
an
errand
for
his
master
,
instead
of
returning
to
his
dinner
;
and
in
passing
along
a
lane
,
a
road
(
called
,
in
compliment
to
the
intentions
of
some
future
builder
,
a
street
)
,
he
encountered
Harry
Carson
,
the
only
person
,
as
far
as
he
saw
,
beside
himself
,
treading
the
unfrequented
path
.
<EOS>
Along
one
side
ran
a
high
broad
fence
,
blackened
over
by
coal
-
tar
,
and
spiked
and
stuck
with
pointed
nails
at
the
top
,
to
prevent
any
one
from
climbing
over
into
the
garden
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
fence
was
the
footpath
.
 
<EOS>
The
carriage
-
road
was
such
as
no
carriage
,
no
,
not
even
a
cart
,
could
possibly
have
passed
along
without
Hercules
to
assist
in
lifting
it
out
of
the
deep
clay
ruts
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
other
side
of
the
way
was
a
dead
brick
wall
;
and
a
field
after
that
,
where
there
was
a
saw
-
pit
and
joiner
's
shed
.
  
<EOS>
Jem
's
heart
beat
violently
when
he
saw
the
gay
,
handsome
young
man
approaching
,
with
a
light
buoyant
step
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
then
,
was
he
whom
Mary
loved
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
,
perhaps
,
no
wonder
;
for
he
seemed
to
the
poor
smith
so
elegant
,
so
well
appointed
,
that
he
felt
the
superiority
in
externals
,
strangely
and
painfully
,
for
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
Then
something
uprose
within
him
,
and
told
him
,
that
"
a
man
's
a
man
for
a
'
that
,
for
a
'
that
,
and
twice
as
much
as
a
'
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
no
longer
felt
troubled
by
the
outward
appearance
of
his
rival
.
  
<EOS>
Harry
Carson
came
on
,
lightly
bounding
over
the
dirty
places
with
almost
a
lad
's
buoyancy
.
 
<EOS>
To
his
surprise
the
dark
,
sturdy
-
looking
artisan
stopped
him
by
saying
respectfully
   
"
May
I
speak
a
word
wi
'
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
my
good
man
,
"
looking
his
astonishment
;
then
finding
that
the
promised
speech
did
not
come
very
quickly
,
he
added
,
"
<EOS>
But
make
haste
,
for
I
'm
in
a
hurry
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
had
cast
about
for
some
less
abrupt
way
of
broaching
the
subject
uppermost
in
his
mind
than
he
now
found
himself
obliged
to
use
.
<EOS>
With
a
husky
voice
that
trembled
as
he
spoke
,
he
said
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
sir
,
yo're
keeping
company
wi
'
a
young
woman
called
Mary
Barton
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
light
broke
in
upon
Henry
Carson
's
mind
,
and
he
paused
before
he
gave
the
answer
for
which
the
other
waited
.
  
<EOS>
Could
this
man
be
a
lover
of
Mary
's
?
 
<EOS>
And
(
strange
stinging
thought
)
<EOS>
could
he
be
beloved
by
her
,
and
so
have
caused
her
obstinate
rejection
of
himself
?
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
Jem
from
head
to
foot
,
a
black
,
grimy
mechanic
,
in
dirty
fustian
clothes
,
strongly
built
,
and
awkward
(
according
to
the
dancing
-
master
)
;
then
he
glanced
at
himself
,
and
recalled
the
reflection
he
had
so
lately
quitted
in
his
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
No
woman
with
eyes
could
choose
the
one
when
the
other
wooed
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Hyperion
to
a
Satyr
.
 
<EOS>
That
quotation
came
aptly
;
he
forgot
"
That
a
man
's
a
man
for
a
'
that
.
"
<EOS>
And
yet
here
was
a
clue
,
which
he
had
often
wanted
,
to
her
changed
conduct
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
loved
this
man
 
if
 
he
hated
the
fellow
,
and
longed
to
strike
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
know
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
Barton
!
<EOS>
let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
that
is
the
name
of
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
An
arrant
flirt
the
little
hussy
is
;
but
very
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
Mary
Barton
is
her
name
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
bit
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
then
so
;
that
Mary
was
a
flirt
;
the
giddy
creature
of
whom
he
spoke
?
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
believe
it
,
and
yet
how
he
wished
the
suggestive
words
unspoken
.
 
<EOS>
That
thought
must
keep
now
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
Even
if
she
were
,
the
more
reason
for
there
being
some
one
to
protect
her
;
poor
faulty
darling
,
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
good
girl
,
sir
,
though
maybe
a
bit
set
up
with
her
beauty
;
but
she
's
her
father
's
only
child
,
sir
,
and
"
 
h
e
stopped
;
he
did
not
like
to
express
suspicion
,
and
yet
he
was
determined
he
would
be
certain
there
was
ground
for
none
.
 
<EOS>
What
should
he
say
?
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
fine
fellow
,
and
what
have
I
to
do
with
that
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
but
loss
of
my
time
,
and
yours
,
too
,
if
you
've
only
stopped
me
to
tell
me
Mary
Barton
is
very
pretty
<EOS>
;
I
know
that
well
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
seemed
as
though
he
would
have
gone
on
,
but
Jem
put
his
black
,
working
,
right
hand
upon
his
arm
to
detain
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
haughty
young
man
shook
it
off
,
and
with
his
glove
pretended
to
brush
away
the
sooty
contamination
that
might
be
left
upon
his
light
greatcoat
sleeve
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
action
aroused
Jem
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
in
plain
words
,
what
I
have
got
to
say
to
you
,
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
been
telled
me
by
one
as
knows
,
and
has
seen
,
that
you
walk
with
this
same
Mary
Barton
,
and
are
known
to
be
courting
her
;
and
her
as
spoke
to
me
about
it
,
thinks
as
how
Mary
loves
you
.
<EOS>
That
may
be
or
may
not
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'm
an
old
friend
of
hers
and
her
father
's
;
and
I
just
wished
to
know
if
you
mean
to
marry
the
girl
.
<EOS>
Spite
of
what
you
said
of
her
lightness
,
I
ha
'
known
her
long
enough
to
be
sure
she
'll
make
a
noble
wife
for
any
one
,
let
him
be
what
he
may
;
and
I
mean
to
stand
by
her
like
a
brother
;
and
if
you
mean
rightly
,
you
'll
not
think
the
worse
on
me
for
what
I
've
now
said
;
and
if
 
but
no
,
I
'll
not
say
what
I
'll
do
to
the
man
who
wrongs
a
hair
of
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
He
shall
rue
it
to
the
longest
day
he
lives
,
that
's
all
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
sir
,
what
I
ask
of
you
is
this
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
mean
fair
and
honourable
by
her
,
well
and
good
:
<EOS>
but
if
not
,
for
your
own
sake
as
well
as
hers
,
leave
her
alone
,
and
never
speak
to
her
more
.
<EOS>
"
Jem
's
voice
quivered
with
the
earnestness
with
which
he
spoke
,
and
he
eagerly
waited
for
some
answer
.
  
<EOS>
Harry
Carson
,
meanwhile
,
instead
of
attending
very
particularly
to
the
purpose
the
man
had
in
addressing
him
,
was
trying
to
gather
from
his
speech
what
was
the
real
state
of
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
He
succeeded
so
far
as
to
comprehend
that
Jem
inclined
to
believe
that
Mary
loved
his
rival
;
and
consequently
,
that
if
the
speaker
were
attached
to
her
himself
,
he
was
not
a
favoured
admirer
.
 
<EOS>
The
idea
came
into
Mr.
Carson
's
mind
,
that
perhaps
,
after
all
,
Mary
loved
him
in
spite
of
her
frequent
and
obstinate
rejections
;
and
that
she
had
employed
this
person
(
whoever
he
was
)
to
bully
him
into
marrying
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
resolved
to
try
and
ascertain
more
correctly
the
man
's
relation
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Either
he
was
a
lover
,
and
if
so
,
not
a
favoured
one
(
in
which
case
Mr.
Carson
could
not
at
all
understand
the
man
's
motives
for
interesting
himself
in
securing
her
marriage
)
;
or
<EOS>
he
was
a
friend
,
an
accomplice
,
whom
she
had
employed
to
bully
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
little
faith
in
goodness
have
the
mean
and
selfish
!
  
<EOS>
"
Before
I
make
you
into
my
confidant
,
my
good
man
,
"
said
Mr.
Carson
,
in
a
contemptuous
tone
,
"
I
think
it
might
be
as
well
to
inquire
your
right
to
meddle
with
our
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
Mary
,
nor
I
,
as
I
conceive
,
called
you
in
as
a
mediator
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
paused
:
he
wanted
a
distinct
answer
to
this
last
supposition
.
 
<EOS>
None
came
;
so
he
began
to
imagine
he
was
to
be
threatened
into
some
engagement
,
and
his
angry
spirit
rose
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
my
fine
fellow
,
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
leave
us
to
ourselves
,
and
not
to
meddle
with
what
does
not
concern
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
were
a
brother
or
father
of
hers
,
the
case
might
have
been
different
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
I
can
only
consider
you
an
impertinent
meddler
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
he
would
have
passed
on
,
but
Jem
stood
in
a
determined
way
before
him
,
saying
   
<EOS>
"
You
say
if
I
had
been
her
brother
,
or
her
father
,
you
'd
have
answered
me
what
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
neither
father
nor
brother
could
love
her
as
I
have
loved
her
 
ay
,
and
as
I
love
her
still
;
if
love
gives
a
right
to
satisfaction
,
it
's
next
to
impossible
any
one
breathing
can
come
up
to
my
right
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
sir
,
tell
me
!
<EOS>
do
you
mean
fair
by
Mary
or
not
?
 
<EOS>
I
've
proved
my
claim
to
know
,
and
,
by
G
#
#
#
#
,
I
will
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
come
,
no
impudence
,
"
replied
Mr.
Carson
,
who
,
having
discovered
what
he
wanted
to
know
(
namely
,
that
Jem
was
a
lover
of
Mary
's
,
and
that
she
was
not
encouraging
his
suit
)
,
wished
to
pass
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
Father
,
brother
,
or
rejected
lover
"
(
with
an
emphasis
on
the
word
rejected
)
"
no
one
has
a
right
to
interfere
between
my
little
girl
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
shall
.
 
<EOS>
Confound
you
,
man
!
<EOS>
get
out
of
my
way
,
or
I
'll
make
you
,
"
as
Jem
still
obstructed
his
path
with
dogged
determination
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
,
then
,
till
you
've
given
me
your
word
about
Mary
,
"
replied
the
mechanic
,
grinding
his
words
out
between
his
teeth
,
and
the
livid
paleness
of
the
anger
he
could
no
longer
keep
down
covering
his
face
till
he
looked
ghastly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
(
with
a
taunting
laugh
)
,
"
then
I
'll
make
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
young
man
raised
his
slight
cane
,
and
smote
the
artisan
across
the
face
with
a
stinging
stroke
.
 
<EOS>
An
instant
<EOS>
afterwards
he
lay
stretched
in
the
muddy
road
,
Jem
standing
over
him
,
panting
with
rage
.
 
<EOS>
What
he
would
have
done
next
in
his
moment
of
ungovernable
passion
,
no
one
knows
;
but
a
policeman
from
the
main
street
,
into
which
this
road
led
,
had
been
sauntering
about
for
some
time
,
unobserved
by
either
of
the
parties
,
and
expecting
some
kind
of
conclusion
like
the
present
to
the
violent
discussion
going
on
between
the
two
young
men
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
minute
he
had
pinioned
Jem
,
who
sullenly
yielded
to
the
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
was
on
his
feet
directly
,
his
face
glowing
with
rage
or
shame
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
take
him
to
the
lock
-
ups
for
assault
,
sir
?
"
said
the
policeman
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
exclaimed
Mr.
Carson
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
struck
him
first
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
no
assault
on
his
side
:
though
,
"
he
continued
,
hissing
out
his
words
to
Jem
,
who
even
hated
freedom
procured
for
him
,
however
justly
,
at
the
intervention
of
his
rival
,
"
I
will
never
forgive
or
forget
insult
.
 
<EOS>
Trust
me
,
"
he
gasped
the
words
in
excess
of
passion
,
"
Mary
shall
fare
no
better
for
your
insolent
interference
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
laughed
,
as
if
with
the
consciousness
of
power
.
  
<EOS>
Jem
replied
with
equal
excitement
   
"
<EOS>
And
if
you
dare
to
injure
her
in
the
least
,
I
will
await
you
where
no
policeman
can
step
in
between
.
 
<EOS>
And
God
shall
judge
between
us
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
policeman
now
interfered
with
persuasions
and
warnings
.
 
<EOS>
He
locked
his
arm
in
Jem
's
to
lead
him
away
in
an
opposite
direction
to
that
in
which
he
saw
Mr.
Carson
was
going
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
submitted
gloomily
,
for
a
few
steps
,
then
wrenched
himself
free
.
 
<EOS>
The
policeman
shouted
after
him
   
<EOS>
"
Take
care
,
my
man
!
<EOS>
there
's
no
girl
on
earth
worth
what
you
'll
be
bringing
on
yourself
if
you
do
n't
mind
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Jem
was
out
of
hearing
.
   
<EOS>
MEETING
BETWEEN
MASTERS
AND
WORKMEN
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
for
a
moment
take
the
scorner
's
chair
;
While
seated
there
,
thou
know'st
not
how
a
word
,
A
tone
,
a
look
,
may
gall
thy
brother
's
heart
,
And
make
him
turn
in
bitterness
against
thee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
LOVE
-
TRUTHS
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
day
arrived
on
which
the
masters
were
to
have
an
interview
with
a
deputation
of
the
workpeople
.
 
<EOS>
The
meeting
was
to
take
place
in
a
public
room
,
at
an
hotel
;
and
there
,
about
eleven
o'clock
,
the
mill
-
owners
,
who
had
received
the
foreign
orders
,
began
to
collect
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
,
the
first
subject
,
however
full
their
minds
might
be
of
another
,
was
the
weather
.
 
<EOS>
Having
done
their
duty
by
all
the
showers
and
sunshine
which
had
occurred
during
the
past
week
,
they
fell
to
talking
about
the
business
which
brought
them
together
.
 
<EOS>
There
might
be
about
twenty
gentlemen
in
the
room
,
including
some
by
courtesy
,
who
were
not
immediately
concerned
in
the
settlement
of
the
present
question
;
but
who
,
nevertheless
,
were
sufficiently
interested
to
attend
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
divided
into
little
groups
,
who
did
not
seem
by
any
means
unanimous
.
 
<EOS>
Some
were
for
a
slight
concession
,
just
a
sugar
-
plum
to
quieten
the
naughty
child
,
a
sacrifice
to
peace
and
quietness
.
 
<EOS>
Some
were
steadily
and
vehemently
opposed
to
the
dangerous
precedent
of
yielding
one
jot
or
one
tittle
to
the
outward
force
of
a
turn
-
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
teaching
the
workpeople
how
to
become
masters
,
said
they
.
 
<EOS>
Did
they
want
the
wildest
thing
here
-
after
,
they
would
know
that
the
way
to
obtain
their
wishes
would
be
to
strike
work
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
one
or
two
of
those
present
had
only
just
returned
from
the
New
Bailey
,
where
one
of
the
turn
-
outs
had
been
tried
for
a
cruel
assault
on
a
poor
north
-
country
weaver
,
who
had
attempted
to
work
at
the
low
price
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
indignant
,
and
justly
so
,
at
the
merciless
manner
in
which
the
poor
fellow
had
been
treated
;
and
their
indignation
at
wrong
,
took
(
as
it
often
does
)
the
extreme
form
of
revenge
.
 
<EOS>
They
felt
as
if
,
rather
than
yield
to
the
body
of
men
who
were
resorting
to
such
cruel
measures
towards
their
fellow
-
workmen
,
they
,
the
masters
,
would
sooner
relinquish
all
the
benefits
to
be
derived
from
the
fulfilment
of
the
commission
,
in
order
that
the
workmen
might
suffer
keenly
.
 
<EOS>
They
forgot
that
the
strike
was
in
this
instance
the
consequence
of
want
and
need
,
suffered
unjustly
,
as
the
endurers
believed
;
for
,
however
insane
,
and
without
ground
of
reason
,
such
was
their
belief
,
and
such
was
the
cause
of
their
violence
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
truth
that
you
can
not
extinguish
violence
by
violence
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
put
it
down
for
a
time
;
but
while
you
are
crowing
over
your
imaginary
success
,
see
if
it
does
not
return
with
seven
devils
worse
than
its
former
self
!
  
<EOS>
No
one
thought
of
treating
the
workmen
as
brethren
and
friends
,
and
openly
,
clearly
,
as
appealing
to
reasonable
men
,
stating
exactly
and
fully
the
circumstances
which
led
the
masters
to
think
it
was
the
wise
policy
of
the
time
to
make
sacrifices
themselves
,
and
to
hope
for
them
from
the
operatives
.
  
<EOS>
In
going
from
group
to
group
in
the
room
,
you
caught
such
a
medley
of
sentences
as
the
following
   
"
Poor
devils
!
<EOS>
they
're
near
enough
to
starving
,
I
'm
afraid
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Aldred
makes
two
cows
'
heads
into
soup
every
week
,
and
people
come
many
miles
to
fetch
it
;
and
if
these
times
last
,
we
must
try
and
do
more
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
must
not
be
bullied
into
anything
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
rise
of
a
shilling
or
so
wo
n't
make
much
difference
,
and
they
will
go
away
thinking
they
've
gained
their
point
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
very
thing
I
object
to
.
 
<EOS>
They
'll
think
so
,
and
whenever
they
've
a
point
to
gain
,
no
matter
how
unreasonable
,
they
'll
strike
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
really
injures
them
more
than
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
how
our
interests
can
be
separated
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
The
d####d
brute
had
thrown
vitriol
on
the
poor
fellow
's
ankles
,
and
you
know
what
a
bad
part
that
is
to
heal
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
to
stand
still
with
the
pain
,
and
that
left
him
at
the
mercy
of
the
cruel
wretch
,
who
beat
him
about
the
head
till
you
'd
hardly
have
known
he
was
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
They
doubt
if
he
'll
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
were
only
for
that
,
I
'll
stand
out
against
them
,
even
if
it
is
the
cause
of
my
ruin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
I
for
one
wo
n't
yield
one
farthing
to
the
cruel
brutes
;
they
're
more
like
wild
beasts
than
human
beings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
Well
,
who
might
have
made
them
different
?
)
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Carson
,
just
go
and
tell
Duncombe
of
this
fresh
instance
of
their
abominable
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
wavering
,
but
I
think
this
will
decide
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
door
was
now
opened
,
and
the
waiter
announced
that
the
men
were
below
,
and
asked
if
it
were
the
pleasure
of
the
gentlemen
that
they
should
be
shown
up
.
  
<EOS>
They
assented
,
and
rapidly
took
their
places
round
the
official
table
;
looking
,
as
like
as
they
could
,
to
the
Roman
senators
who
awaited
the
irruption
of
Brennus
and
his
Gauls
.
  
<EOS>
Tramp
,
tramp
,
came
the
heavy
clogged
feet
up
the
stairs
;
and
in
a
minute
five
wild
,
earnest
-
looking
men
stood
in
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
John
Barton
,
from
some
mistake
as
to
time
,
was
not
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
Had
they
been
larger
-
boned
men
,
you
would
have
called
them
gaunt
;
as
it
was
,
they
were
little
of
stature
,
and
their
fustian
clothes
hung
loosely
upon
their
shrunk
limbs
.
 
<EOS>
In
choosing
their
delegates
,
too
,
the
operatives
had
had
more
regard
to
their
brains
,
and
power
of
speech
,
than
to
their
wardrobes
;
they
might
have
read
the
opinions
of
that
worthy
Professor
Teufelsdreck
,
in
Sartor
Resartus
,
to
judge
from
the
dilapidated
coats
and
trousers
,
which
yet
clothed
men
of
parts
and
of
power
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
long
since
many
of
them
had
known
the
luxury
of
a
new
article
of
dress
;
and
air
-
gaps
were
to
be
seen
in
their
garments
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
masters
were
rather
affronted
at
such
a
ragged
detachment
coming
between
the
wind
and
their
nobility
;
but
what
cared
they
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
request
of
a
gentleman
hastily
chosen
to
officiate
as
chairman
,
the
leader
of
the
delegates
read
,
in
a
high
-
pitched
,
psalm
-
singing
voice
,
a
paper
,
containing
the
operatives
'
statement
of
the
case
at
issue
,
their
complaints
,
and
their
demands
,
which
last
were
not
remarkable
for
moderation
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
then
desired
to
withdraw
for
a
few
minutes
,
with
his
fellow
-
delegates
,
to
another
room
,
while
the
masters
considered
what
should
be
their
definite
answer
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
men
had
left
the
room
,
a
whispered
earnest
consultation
took
place
,
every
one
re
-
urging
his
former
arguments
.
 
<EOS>
The
conceders
carried
the
day
,
but
only
by
a
majority
of
one
.
 
<EOS>
The
minority
haughtily
and
audibly
expressed
their
dissent
from
the
measures
to
be
adopted
,
even
after
the
delegates
re
-
entered
the
room
<EOS>
;
their
words
and
looks
did
not
pass
unheeded
by
the
quick
-
eyed
operatives
;
their
names
were
registered
in
bitter
hearts
.
  
<EOS>
The
masters
could
not
consent
to
the
advance
demanded
by
the
workmen
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
agree
to
give
one
shilling
per
week
more
than
they
had
previously
offered
.
 
<EOS>
Were
the
delegates
empowered
to
accept
such
offer
?
  
<EOS>
They
were
empowered
to
accept
or
decline
any
offer
made
that
day
by
the
masters
.
  
<EOS>
Then
it
might
be
as
well
for
them
to
consult
among
themselves
as
to
what
should
be
their
decision
.
 
<EOS>
They
again
withdrew
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
for
long
.
 
<EOS>
They
came
back
,
and
positively
declined
any
compromise
of
their
demands
.
  
<EOS>
Then
up
sprang
Mr.
Henry
Carson
,
the
head
and
voice
of
the
violent
party
among
the
masters
,
and
addressing
the
chairman
,
even
before
the
scowling
operatives
,
he
proposed
some
resolutions
,
which
he
,
and
those
who
agreed
with
him
,
had
been
concocting
during
this
last
absence
of
the
deputation
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
,
firstly
,
withdrawing
the
proposal
just
made
,
and
declaring
all
communication
between
the
masters
and
that
particular
Trades
'
Union
at
an
end
;
secondly
,
declaring
that
no
master
would
employ
any
workman
in
future
,
unless
he
signed
a
declaration
that
he
did
not
belong
to
any
Trades
'
Union
,
and
pledged
himself
not
to
assist
or
subscribe
to
any
society
,
having
for
its
object
interference
with
the
masters
'
powers
;
and
,
thirdly
,
that
the
masters
should
pledge
themselves
to
protect
and
encourage
all
workmen
willing
to
accept
employment
on
those
conditions
,
and
at
the
rate
of
wages
first
offered
.
 
<EOS>
Considering
that
the
men
who
now
stood
listening
with
lowering
brows
of
defiance
were
all
of
them
leading
members
of
the
Union
,
such
resolutions
were
in
themselves
sufficiently
provocative
of
animosity
:
but
not
content
with
simply
stating
them
,
Harry
Carson
went
on
to
characterise
the
conduct
of
the
workmen
in
no
measured
terms
;
every
word
he
spoke
rendering
their
looks
more
livid
,
their
glaring
eyes
more
fierce
.
 
<EOS>
One
among
them
would
have
spoken
,
but
checked
himself
,
in
obedience
to
the
stern
glance
and
pressure
on
his
arm
,
received
from
the
leader
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
sat
down
,
and
a
friend
instantly
got
up
to
second
the
motion
.
<EOS>
It
was
carried
,
but
far
from
unanimously
.
 
<EOS>
The
chairman
announced
it
to
the
delegates
(
who
had
been
once
more
turned
out
of
the
room
for
a
division
)
.
 
<EOS>
They
received
it
with
deep
brooding
silence
,
but
spake
never
a
word
,
and
left
the
room
without
even
a
bow
.
  
<EOS>
Now
there
had
been
some
by
-
play
at
this
meeting
,
not
recorded
in
the
Manchester
newspapers
,
which
gave
an
account
of
the
more
regular
part
of
the
transaction
.
  
<EOS>
While
the
men
had
stood
grouped
near
the
door
,
on
their
first
entrance
,
Mr.
Harry
Carson
had
taken
out
his
silver
pencil
,
and
had
drawn
an
admirable
caricature
of
them
 
lank
,
ragged
,
dispirited
,
and
famine
-
stricken
.
 
<EOS>
Underneath
he
wrote
a
hasty
quotation
from
the
fat
knight
's
well
-
known
speech
in
Henry
IV
.
 
<EOS>
He
passed
it
to
one
of
his
neighbours
,
who
acknowledged
the
likeness
instantly
,
and
by
him
it
was
sent
round
to
others
,
who
all
smiled
and
nodded
their
heads
.
<EOS>
When
it
came
back
to
its
owner
he
tore
the
back
of
the
letter
on
which
it
was
drawn
in
two
,
twisted
them
up
,
and
flung
them
into
the
fireplace
;
but
,
careless
whether
they
reached
their
aim
or
not
,
he
did
not
look
to
see
that
they
fell
just
short
of
any
consuming
cinders
.
  
<EOS>
This
proceeding
was
closely
observed
by
one
of
the
men
.
  
<EOS>
He
watched
the
masters
as
they
left
the
hotel
(
laughing
,
some
of
them
were
,
at
passing
jokes
)
,
and
when
all
had
gone
,
he
re
-
entered
.
<EOS>
He
went
to
the
waiter
,
who
recognised
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
bit
on
a
picture
up
yonder
,
as
one
o
'
the
gentlemen
threw
away
;
I
've
a
little
lad
at
home
as
dearly
loves
a
picture
;
by
your
leave
I
'll
go
up
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
waiter
,
good
-
natured
and
sympathetic
,
accompanied
him
upstairs
;
saw
the
paper
picked
up
and
untwisted
,
and
then
being
convinced
,
by
a
hasty
glance
at
its
contents
,
that
it
was
only
what
the
man
had
called
it
,
"
a
bit
of
a
picture
,
"
he
allowed
him
to
bear
away
his
prize
.
  
<EOS>
Towards
seven
o'clock
that
evening
,
many
operatives
began
to
assemble
in
a
room
in
the
Weavers
'
Arms
public
-
house
,
a
room
appropriated
for
"
festive
occasions
,
"
as
the
landlord
,
in
his
circular
,
on
opening
the
premises
,
had
described
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
it
was
on
no
festive
occasion
that
they
met
there
this
night
.
 
<EOS>
Starved
,
irritated
,
despairing
men
,
they
were
assembling
to
hear
the
answer
that
morning
given
by
the
masters
to
their
delegates
;
after
which
,
as
was
stated
in
the
notice
,
a
gentleman
from
London
would
have
the
honour
of
addressing
the
meeting
on
the
present
state
of
affairs
between
the
employers
and
the
employed
,
or
(
as
he
chose
to
term
them
)
<EOS>
the
idle
and
the
industrious
classes
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
was
not
large
,
but
its
bareness
of
furniture
made
it
appear
so
.
 
<EOS>
Unshaded
gas
flared
down
upon
the
lean
and
unwashed
artisans
as
they
entered
,
their
eyes
blinking
at
the
excess
of
light
.
  
<EOS>
They
took
their
seats
on
benches
,
and
awaited
the
deputation
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
,
gloomily
and
ferociously
,
delivered
the
masters
'
ultimatum
,
adding
thereto
not
one
word
of
their
own
;
and
it
sank
all
the
deeper
into
the
sore
hearts
of
the
listeners
for
their
forbearance
.
  
<EOS>
Then
the
"
gentleman
from
London
"
(
who
had
been
previously
informed
of
the
masters
'
decision
)
entered
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
have
been
puzzled
to
define
his
exact
position
,
or
what
was
the
state
of
his
mind
as
regarded
education
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
so
self
-
conscious
,
so
far
from
earnest
,
among
the
group
of
eager
,
fierce
,
absorbed
men
,
among
whom
he
now
stood
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
have
been
a
disgraced
medical
student
of
the
Bob
Sawyer
class
,
or
an
unsuccessful
actor
,
or
a
flashy
shopman
.
<EOS>
The
impression
he
would
have
given
you
would
have
been
unfavourable
,
and
yet
there
was
much
about
him
that
could
only
be
characterised
as
doubtful
.
  
<EOS>
He
smirked
in
acknowledgment
of
their
uncouth
greetings
,
and
sat
down
;
then
glancing
round
,
he
inquired
whether
it
would
not
be
agreeable
to
the
gentlemen
present
to
have
pipes
and
liquor
handed
round
,
adding
,
that
he
would
stand
treat
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
man
who
has
had
his
taste
educated
to
love
reading
,
falls
devouringly
upon
books
after
a
long
abstinence
,
so
these
poor
fellows
,
whose
tastes
had
been
left
to
educate
themselves
into
a
liking
for
tobacco
,
beer
,
and
similar
gratifications
,
gleamed
up
at
the
proposal
of
the
London
delegate
.
 
<EOS>
Tobacco
and
drink
deaden
the
pangs
of
hunger
,
and
make
one
forget
the
miserable
home
,
the
desolate
future
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
now
ready
to
listen
to
him
with
approbation
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
it
;
and
rising
like
a
great
orator
,
with
his
right
arm
outstretched
,
his
left
in
the
breast
of
his
waistcoat
,
he
began
to
declaim
,
with
a
forced
theatrical
voice
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
burst
of
eloquence
,
in
which
he
blended
the
deeds
of
the
elder
and
the
younger
Brutus
,
and
magnified
the
resistless
might
of
the
"
millions
of
Manchester
,
"
the
Londoner
descended
to
matter
-
of
-
fact
business
,
and
in
his
capacity
this
way
he
did
not
belie
the
good
judgment
of
those
who
had
sent
him
as
a
delegate
.
<EOS>
Masses
of
people
,
when
left
to
their
own
free
choice
,
seem
to
have
discretion
in
distinguishing
men
of
natural
talent
:
it
is
a
pity
they
so
little
regard
temper
and
principles
.
 
<EOS>
He
rapidly
dictated
resolutions
,
and
suggested
measures
.
 
<EOS>
He
wrote
out
a
stirring
placard
for
the
walls
.
 
<EOS>
He
proposed
sending
delegates
to
entreat
the
assistance
of
other
Trades
'
Unions
in
other
towns
.
 
<EOS>
He
headed
the
list
of
subscribing
Unions
,
by
a
liberal
donation
from
that
with
which
he
was
especially
connected
in
London
;
and
what
was
more
,
and
more
uncommon
,
he
paid
down
the
money
in
real
,
clinking
,
blinking
,
golden
sovereigns
!
 
<EOS>
The
money
,
alas
!
<EOS>
was
cravingly
required
;
but
before
alleviating
any
private
necessities
on
the
morrow
,
small
sums
were
handed
to
each
of
the
delegates
,
who
were
in
a
day
or
two
to
set
out
on
their
expeditions
to
Glasgow
,
Newcastle
,
Nottingham
,
etc
.
<EOS>
These
men
were
most
of
them
members
of
the
deputation
who
had
that
morning
waited
upon
the
masters
.
 
<EOS>
After
he
had
drawn
up
some
letters
,
and
spoken
a
few
more
stirring
words
,
the
gentleman
from
London
withdrew
,
previously
shaking
hands
all
round
;
and
many
speedily
followed
him
out
of
the
room
,
and
out
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
The
newly
-
appointed
delegates
,
and
one
or
two
others
,
remained
behind
to
talk
over
their
respective
missions
,
and
to
give
and
exchange
opinions
in
more
homely
and
natural
language
than
they
dared
to
use
before
the
London
orator
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
rare
chap
,
yon
,
"
began
one
,
indicating
the
departed
delegate
by
a
jerk
of
his
thumb
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
getten
the
gift
of
the
gab
,
anyhow
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
ay
!
<EOS>
he
knows
what
he
's
about
.
 
<EOS>
See
how
he
poured
it
into
us
about
that
there
Brutus
.
 
<EOS>
He
were
pretty
hard
,
too
,
to
kill
his
own
son
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
kill
mine
if
he
took
part
with
the
masters
;
to
be
sure
,
he
's
but
a
step
-
son
,
but
that
makes
no
odds
,
"
said
another
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
tongues
were
hushed
,
and
all
eyes
were
directed
towards
the
member
of
the
deputation
who
had
that
morning
returned
to
the
hotel
to
obtain
possession
of
Harry
Carson
's
clever
caricature
of
the
operatives
.
  
<EOS>
The
heads
clustered
together
,
to
gaze
at
and
detect
the
likenesses
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
John
Slater
!
 
<EOS>
I
'd
ha
'
known
him
anywhere
,
by
his
big
nose
.
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
how
like
;
that
's
me
,
by
G
-
d
<EOS>
,
it
's
the
very
way
I
'm
obligated
to
pin
my
waistcoat
up
,
to
hide
that
I
've
getten
no
shirt
.
 
<EOS>
That
IS
a
shame
,
and
I
'll
not
stand
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
"
said
John
Slater
,
after
having
acknowledged
his
nose
and
his
likeness
;
"
I
could
laugh
at
a
jest
as
well
as
e'er
the
best
on
'em
,
though
it
did
tell
agen
mysel
,
if
I
were
not
clemming
"
(
<EOS>
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
;
he
was
a
poor
,
pinched
,
sharp
-
featured
man
,
with
a
gentle
and
melancholy
expression
of
countenance
)
,
"
and
if
I
could
keep
from
thinking
of
them
at
home
,
as
is
clemming
;
but
with
their
cries
for
food
ringing
in
my
ears
,
and
making
me
afeard
of
going
home
,
and
wonder
if
I
should
hear
'em
wailing
out
,
if
I
lay
cold
and
drowned
at
th
'
bottom
o
'
th
'
canal
,
there
 
why
,
man
,
I
can
not
laugh
at
aught
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
to
make
me
sad
that
there
is
any
as
can
make
game
on
what
they
've
never
knowed
;
as
can
make
such
laughable
pictures
on
men
,
whose
very
hearts
within
'em
are
so
raw
and
sore
as
ours
were
and
are
,
God
help
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
John
Barton
began
to
speak
;
they
turned
to
him
with
great
attention
.
<EOS>
"
It
makes
me
more
than
sad
,
it
makes
my
heart
burn
within
me
,
to
see
that
folk
can
make
a
jest
of
striving
men
;
of
chaps
who
comed
to
ask
for
a
bit
o
'
fire
for
th
'
old
granny
,
as
shivers
i

th

cold
;
for
a
bit
o
'
bedding
,
and
some
warm
clothing
to
the
poor
wife
who
lies
in
labour
on
th
'
damp
flags
;
and
for
victuals
for
the
childer
,
whose
little
voices
are
getting
too
faint
and
weak
to
cry
aloud
wi
'
hunger

<EOS>
For
,
brothers
,
is
not
them
the
things
we
ask
for
when
we
ask
for
more
wage
?
 
<EOS>
We
donnot
want
dainties
,
we
want
bellyfuls

;
we
donnot
want
gimcrack
coats

waistcoats

we
want
warm
clothes

and
so
that
we
get
'em
,
we
'd
not
quarrel
wi
'
what
they
're
made
on
.
 
<EOS>
We
donnot
want
their
grand
houses
,
we
want
a
roof
to
cover
us
from
the
rain
,
and
the
snow
,
and
the
storm
;
ay
,
and
not
alone
to
cover
us
,
but
the
helpless
ones
that
cling
to
us
in
the
keen
wind
,
and
ask
us
with
their
eyes
why
we
brought
'em
into
th
'
world
to
suffer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
lowered
his
deep
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
seen
a
father
who
had
killed
his
child
rather
than
<EOS>
let
it
clem
before
his
eyes
;
and
he
were
a
tender
-
hearted
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
began
again
in
his
usual
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
come
to
th
'
masters
wi
'
full
hearts
,
to
ask
for
them
things
I
named
afore
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
that
they
've
getten
money
,
as
we
've
earned
for
'em
;
we
know
trade
is
mending
,
and
they
've
large
orders
,
for
which
they
'll
be
well
paid
;
we
ask
for
our
share
o
'
th
'
payment
;
for
,
say
we
,
if
th
'
masters
get
our
share
of
payment
it
will
only
go
to
keep
servants
and
horses
 
to
more
dress
and
pomp
.
 
<EOS>
Well
<EOS>
and
good
,
if
yo
choose
to
be
fools
we
'll
not
hinder
you
,
so
long
as
you
're
just
;
but
our
share
we
must
and
will
have
;
we
'll
not
be
cheated
.
 
<EOS>
We
want
it
for
daily
bread
,
for
life
itself
;
and
not
for
our
own
lives
neither
(
for
there
's
many
a
one
here
<EOS>
,
I
know
by
mysel
,
as
would
be
glad
and
thankful
to
lie
down
and
die
out
o
'
this
weary
world
)
,
but
for
the
lives
of
them
little
ones
,
who
do
n't
yet
know
what
life
is
,
and
are
afeard
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
we
come
before
th
'
masters
to
state
what
we
want
,
and
what
we
must
have
,
afore
we
'll
set
shoulder
to
their
work
;
and
they
say
,
"
No
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
One
would
think
that
would
be
enough
of
hard
-
heartedness
,
but
it
is
n't
.
<EOS>
They
go
and
make
jesting
pictures
on
us
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
laugh
at
mysel
,
as
well
as
poor
John
Slater
there
;
but
then
I
must
be
easy
in
my
mind
to
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
only
know
that
I
would
give
the
last
drop
of
my
blood
to
avenge
us
on
yon
chap
,
who
had
so
little
feeling
in
him
as
to
make
game
on
earnest
,
suffering
men
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
low
angry
murmur
was
heard
among
the
men
,
but
it
did
not
yet
take
form
or
words
.
 
<EOS>
John
continued
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
wonder
,
chaps
,
<EOS>
how
I
came
to
miss
the
time
this
morning
;
I
'll
just
tell
you
what
I
was
a
-
doing
.
 
<EOS>
Th
'
chaplain
at
the
New
Bailey
sent
and
gived
me
an
order
to
see
Jonas
Higginbotham
;
him
as
was
taken
up
last
week
for
throwing
vitriol
in
a
knob
-
stick
's
face
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
could
n't
help
but
go
;
and
I
did
n't
reckon
it
would
ha
'
kept
me
so
late
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
were
like
one
crazy
when
I
got
to
him
;
he
said
he
could
na
get
rest
night
or
day
for
th
'
face
of
the
poor
fellow
he
had
damaged
;
then
he
thought
on
his
weak
,
clemmed
look
,
as
he
tramped
,
footsore
,
into
town
;
and
Jonas
thought
,
maybe
,
he
had
left
them
at
home
as
would
look
for
news
,
and
hope
and
get
none
,
but
,
haply
,
tidings
of
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Jonas
had
thought
on
these
things
till
he
could
not
rest
,
but
walked
up
and
down
continually
like
a
wild
beast
in
his
cage
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
bethought
him
on
a
way
to
help
a
bit
,
and
he
got
the
chaplain
to
send
for
me
;
and
he
telled
me
this
;
and
that
th
'
man
were
lying
in
the
Infirmary
,
and
he
bade
me
go
<EOS>
(
to
-
day
's
the
day
as
folk
may
be
admitted
into
th
'
Infirmary
)
and
get
his
silver
watch
,
as
was
his
mother
's
,
and
sell
it
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
take
the
money
,
and
bid
the
poor
knob
-
stick
send
it
to
his
friends
beyond
Burnley
;
and
I
were
to
take
him
Jonas
's
kind
regards
,
and
he
humbly
axed
him
to
forgive
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
did
what
Jonas
wished
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
bless
your
life
,
none
on
us
would
ever
throw
vitriol
again
(
at
least
at
a
knob
-
stick
)
if
they
could
see
the
sight
I
saw
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
lay
,
his
face
all
wrapped
in
cloths
,
so
I
did
n't
see
that
:
but
not
a
limb
,
nor
a
bit
of
a
limb
,
could
keep
from
quivering
with
pain
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
ha
'
bitten
his
hand
to
keep
down
his
moans
,
but
could
n't
,
his
face
hurt
him
so
if
he
moved
it
<EOS>
e'er
<EOS>
so
little
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
scarce
mind
me
when
I
telled
him
about
Jonas
;
he
did
squeeze
my
hand
when
I
jingled
the
money
,
but
when
I
axed
his
wife
's
name
,
he
shrieked
out
,
"
Mary
,
Mary
,
shall
I
never
see
you
again
?
 
<EOS>
Mary
,
my
darling
,
they
've
made
me
blind
because
I
wanted
to
work
for
you
and
our
own
baby
;
O
Mary
,
Mary
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
the
nurse
came
,
and
said
he
were
raving
,
and
that
I
had
made
him
worse
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
'm
afeard
<EOS>
it
was
true
;
yet
I
were
loth
to
go
without
knowing
where
to
send
the
money
.
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
.
.
 
<EOS>
So
that
kept
me
beyond
my
time
,
chaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hear
where
the
wife
lived
at
last
?
"
asked
many
anxious
voices
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
he
went
on
talking
to
her
,
till
his
words
cut
my
heart
like
a
knife
.
 
<EOS>
I
axed
th
'
nurse
to
find
out
who
she
was
,
and
where
she
lived
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
I
'm
more
especial
naming
it
now
for
is
this
,
 
for
one
thing
I
wanted
you
all
to
know
why
I
were
n't
at
my
post
this
morning
;
for
another
,
I
wish
to
say
,
that
I
,
for
one
,
ha
'
seen
enough
of
what
comes
of
attacking
knob
-
sticks
,
and
I
'll
ha
'
nought
to
do
with
it
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
were
some
expressions
of
disapprobation
,
but
John
did
not
mind
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
!
<EOS>
I
'm
no
coward
,
"
he
replied
,
"
and
I
'm
true
to
th
'
backbone
.
<EOS>
What
I
would
like
,
and
what
I
would
do
,
would
be
to
fight
the
masters
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
one
among
yo
called
me
a
coward
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
every
man
has
a
right
to
his
opinion
;
but
since
I
've
thought
on
th
'
matter
to
-
day
<EOS>
I
've
thought
we
han
all
on
us
<EOS>
been
more
like
cowards
in
attacking
the
poor
like
ourselves
;
them
as
has
none
to
help
,
but
mun
choose
between
vitriol
and
starvation
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
we
're
more
cowardly
in
doing
that
than
in
leaving
them
alone
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
what
I
would
do
is
this
.
<EOS>
Have
at
the
masters
!
"
 
<EOS>
Again
he
shouted
,
"
Have
at
the
masters
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
lower
;
all
listened
with
hushed
breath
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
masters
as
has
wrought
this
woe
;
it
's
the
masters
as
should
pay
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Him
as
called
me
coward
just
now
,
may
try
if
I
am
one
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
Set
me
to
serve
out
the
masters
,
and
see
if
there
's
aught
I
'll
stick
at
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
give
the
masters
a
bit
on
a
fright
if
one
of
them
were
beaten
within
an
inch
of
his
life
,
"
said
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
or
beaten
till
no
life
were
left
in
him
,
"
growled
another
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
with
words
,
or
looks
that
told
more
than
words
,
they
built
up
a
deadly
plan
.
 
<EOS>
Deeper
and
darker
grew
the
import
of
their
speeches
,
as
they
stood
hoarsely
muttering
their
meaning
out
,
and
glaring
with
eyes
that
told
the
terror
their
own
thoughts
were
to
them
,
upon
their
neighbours
.
 
<EOS>
Their
clenched
fists
,
their
set
teeth
,
their
livid
looks
,
all
told
the
suffering
which
their
minds
were
voluntarily
undergoing
in
the
contemplation
of
crime
,
and
in
familiarising
themselves
with
its
details
.
  
<EOS>
Then
came
one
of
those
fierce
terrible
oaths
which
bind
members
of
Trades
'
Unions
to
any
given
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Then
under
the
flaring
gaslight
,
they
met
together
to
consult
further
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
distrust
of
guilt
,
each
was
suspicious
of
his
neighbour
;
each
dreaded
the
treachery
of
another
.
 
<EOS>
A
number
of
pieces
of
paper
(
the
identical
letter
on
which
the
caricature
had
been
drawn
that
very
morning
)
were
torn
up
,
and
one
was
marked
.
 
<EOS>
Then
all
were
folded
up
again
,
looking
exactly
alike
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
shuffled
together
in
a
hat
.
 
<EOS>
The
gas
was
extinguished
;
each
drew
out
a
paper
.
 
<EOS>
The
gas
was
re
-
lighted
.
 
<EOS>
Then
each
went
as
far
as
he
could
from
his
fellows
,
and
examined
the
paper
he
had
drawn
without
saying
a
word
,
and
with
a
countenance
as
stony
and
immovable
as
he
could
make
it
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
still
rigidly
silent
,
they
each
took
up
their
hats
and
went
every
one
his
own
way
.
  
<EOS>
He
who
had
drawn
the
marked
paper
had
drawn
the
lot
of
the
assassin
!
<EOS>
and
he
had
sworn
to
act
according
to
his
drawing
!
 
<EOS>
But
no
one
,
save
God
and
his
own
conscience
,
knew
who
was
the
appointed
murderer
.

A
NONYMOUS
.
  
<EOS>
The
events
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
took
place
on
a
Tuesday
.
 
<EOS>
On
Thursday
afternoon
Mary
was
surprised
,
in
the
midst
of
some
little
bustle
in
which
she
was
engaged
,
by
the
entrance
of
Will
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
strange
<EOS>
,
at
least
it
was
strange
to
see
any
different
expression
on
his
face
to
his
usual
joyous
beaming
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
paper
parcel
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
in
,
and
sat
down
,
more
quietly
than
usual
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Will
!
<EOS>
what
's
the
matter
with
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
seem
quite
cut
up
about
something
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
,
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
come
to
say
good
-
bye
;
and
few
folk
like
to
say
good
-
bye
to
them
they
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
!
 
<EOS>
Bless
me
,
Will
,
that
's
sudden
,
is
n't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
left
off
ironing
,
and
came
and
stood
near
the
fireplace
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
always
liked
Will
;
but
now
it
seemed
as
if
a
sudden
spring
of
sisterly
love
had
gushed
up
in
her
heart
,
so
sorry
did
she
feel
to
hear
of
his
approaching
departure
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
sudden
,
is
n't
it
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
repeating
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
's
very
sudden
,
"
said
he
dreamily
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
is
n't
"
;
rousing
himself
to
think
of
what
he
was
saying
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
captain
told
me
in
a
fortnight
he
would
be
ready
to
sail
again
;
but
it
comes
very
sudden
on
me
<EOS>
,
I
had
got
so
fond
of
you
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
understood
the
particular
fondness
that
was
thus
generalised
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
not
a
fortnight
since
you
came
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
fortnight
since
you
knocked
at
Jane
Wilson
's
door
,
and
<EOS>
I
was
there
,
you
remember
.
<EOS>
Nothing
like
a
fortnight
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
<EOS>
;
I
know
it
's
not
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
you
see
,
I
got
a
letter
this
afternoon
from
Jack
Harris
,
to
tell
me
our
ship
sails
on
Tuesday
next
;
and
it
's
long
since
I
promised
my
uncle
(
my
mother
's
brother
,
him
that
lives
at
Kirk
-
Christ
,
beyond
Ramsay
,
in
the
Isle
of
Man
)
<EOS>
that
I
'd
go
and
see
him
and
his
,
this
time
of
coming
ashore
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
enough
;
but
I
must
n't
slight
poor
mother
's
friends
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
go
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
try
to
keep
me
,
"
said
he
,
evidently
fearing
the
strength
of
his
own
resolution
,
if
hard
pressed
by
entreaty
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
a
-
going
,
Will
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
're
right
;
only
I
ca
n't
help
feeling
sorry
you
're
going
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
so
flat
to
be
left
behind
.
 
<EOS>
When
do
you
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
see
you
again

<EOS>
"
  
"
To
-
night
!
<EOS>
and
you
go
to
Liverpool
!
 
<EOS>
Maybe
you
and
father
will
go
together
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
going
to
Glasgow
,
by
way
of
Liverpool
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
walking
;
and
I
do
n't
think
your
father
will
be
up
to
walking
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
and
why
on
earth
are
you
walking
?
 
<EOS>
You
can
get
by
railway
for
three
-
and
-
sixpence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
but
Mary
!
<EOS>
(
thou
must
n't
let
out
what
I
'm
going
to
tell
thee
)
<EOS>
I
have
n't
got
three
shillings
,
no
,
nor
even
a
sixpence
left
,
at
least
,
not
here
;
before
I
came
I
gave
my
landlady
enough
to
carry
me
to
the
island
and
back
,
and
maybe
a
trifle
for
presents
,
and
I
brought
the
rest
here
;
and
it
's
all
gone
<EOS>
but
this
,
"
jingling
a
few
coppers
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
never
fret
over
my
walking
a
matter
of
thirty
mile
,
"
added
he
,
as
he
saw
she
looked
grave
and
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
fine
clear
night
,
and
I
shall
set
off
betimes
,
and
get
in
afore
the
Manx
packet
sails
.
<EOS>
Where
's
your
father
going
?
 
<EOS>
To
Glasgow
did
you
say
?
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
and
I
may
have
a
bit
of
a
trip
together
then
,
for
,
if
the
Manx
boat
has
sailed
when
I
get
into
Liverpool
,
I
shall
go
by
a
Scotch
packet
.
<EOS>
What
's
he
going
to
do
in
Glasgow
?
 
<EOS>
Seek
for
work
?
 
<EOS>
Trade
is
as
bad
there
as
here
,
folk
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
he
knows
that
,
"
answered
Mary
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
sometimes
think
he
'll
never
get
work
again
,
and
that
trade
will
never
mend
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
very
hard
to
keep
up
one
's
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
were
a
boy
<EOS>
,
I
'd
go
to
sea
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
getting
away
from
bad
news
at
any
rate
;
and
now
,
there
's
hardly
a
creature
that
crosses
the
door
-
step
,
but
has
something
sad
and
unhappy
to
tell
one
.
 
<EOS>
Father
is
going
as
a
delegate
from
his
Union
,
to
ask
help
from
the
Glasgow
folk
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
starting
this
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
sighed
,
for
the
feeling
again
came
over
her
that
it
was
very
flat
to
be
left
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
no
one
crosses
the
threshold
but
has
something
sad
to
say
;
you
do
n't
mean
that
Margaret
Jennings
has
any
trouble
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
young
sailor
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
replied
Mary
,
smiling
a
little
;
"
she
's
the
only
one
I
know
,
I
believe
,
who
seems
free
from
care
.
 
<EOS>
Her
blindness
almost
appears
a
blessing
sometimes
;
she
was
so
down
-
hearted
when
she
dreaded
it
,
and
now
she
seems
so
calm
and
happy
<EOS>
when
it
's
downright
come
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
Margaret
's
happy
,
I
do
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
almost
wish
it
had
been
otherwise
,
"
said
Will
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
have
been
so
glad
to
comfort
her
,
and
cherish
her
,
if
she
had
been
in
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
ca
n't
you
cherish
her
,
even
though
she
is
happy
?
"
asked
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
She
seems
so
much
better
than
I
am
!
 
<EOS>
And
her
voice
!
 
<EOS>
When
I
hear
it
,
and
think
of
the
wishes
that
are
in
my
heart
,
it
seems
as
much
out
of
place
to
ask
her
to
be
my
wife
,
as
it
would
be
to
ask
an
angel
from
heaven
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
could
not
help
laughing
outright
,
in
spite
of
her
depression
,
at
the
idea
of
Margaret
as
an
angel
;
it
was
so
difficult
(
even
to
her
dressmaking
imagination
)
to
fancy
where
,
and
how
,
the
wings
would
be
fastened
to
the
brown
stuff
gown
,
or
the
blue
and
yellow
print
.
  
<EOS>
Will
laughed
,
too
,
a
little
,
out
of
sympathy
with
Mary
's
pretty
merry
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
said
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
you
may
laugh
,
Mary
<EOS>
:
it
only
shows
you
've
never
been
in
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
an
instant
Mary
was
carnation
colour
,
and
the
tears
sprang
to
her
soft
grey
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
She
that
was
suffering
so
much
from
the
doubts
arising
from
love
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
unkind
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
notice
her
change
of
look
and
of
complexion
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
noticed
that
she
was
silent
,
so
he
continued
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
 
I
think
,
that
when
I
come
back
from
this
voyage
,
I
will
speak
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
my
fourth
voyage
in
the
same
ship
and
with
the
same
captain
,
and
he
's
promised
he
'll
make
me
a
second
mate
after
this
trip
;
then
I
shall
have
something
to
offer
Margaret
;
and
her
grandfather
,
and
Aunt
Alice
,
shall
live
with
her
,
and
keep
her
from
being
lonesome
while
I
'm
at
sea
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
speaking
as
if
she
cared
for
me
,
and
would
marry
me
;
d'ye
think
she
does
care
at
all
for
me
,
Mary
?
"
<EOS>
asked
he
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
had
a
very
decided
opinion
of
her
own
on
the
subject
,
but
she
did
not
feel
as
if
she
had
any
right
to
give
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
said
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
ask
Margaret
,
not
me
,
<EOS>
Will
<EOS>
;
she
's
never
named
your
name
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
countenance
fell
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
should
say
that
was
a
good
sign
from
a
girl
like
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
no
right
to
say
what
I
think
;
but
,
if
I
was
you
,
I
would
not
leave
her
now
without
speaking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
speak
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
tried
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
in
to
wish
them
good
-
bye
,
and
my
voice
stuck
in
my
throat
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
say
nought
of
what
I
'd
planned
to
say
;
and
I
never
thought
of
being
so
bold
as
to
offer
her
marriage
till
I
'd
been
my
next
trip
,
and
been
made
mate
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
even
offer
her
this
box
,
"
said
he
,
undoing
his
paper
parcel
and
displaying
a
gaudily
ornamented
accordion
;
"
I
longed
to
buy
her
something
,
and
I
thought
,
if
it
were
something
in
the
music
line
,
she
would
maybe
fancy
it
more
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
will
you
give
it
to
her
,
Mary
,
when
I
'm
gone
?
<EOS>
and
,
if
you
can
slip
in
something
tender
,
  
something
,
you
know
,
of
what
I
feel
 
<EOS>
maybe
she
would
listen
to
you
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
promised
that
she
would
do
all
that
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
thinking
on
her
many
and
many
a
night
,
when
I
'm
keeping
my
watch
in
mid
-
sea
;
I
wonder
if
she
will
ever
think
on
me
when
the
wind
is
whistling
,
and
the
gale
rising
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
often
speak
of
me
to
her
,
Mary
?
 
<EOS>
And
if
I
should
meet
with
any
mischance
,
tell
her
how
dear
,
how
very
dear
,
she
was
to
me
,
and
bid
her
,
for
the
sake
of
one
who
loved
her
well
,
try
and
comfort
my
poor
aunt
Alice
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
old
aunt
!
<EOS>
you
and
Margaret
will
often
go
and
see
her
,
wo
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
She
's
sadly
failed
since
I
was
last
ashore
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
good
as
she
has
been
!
<EOS>
When
I
lived
with
her
,
a
little
wee
chap
,
I
used
to
be
wakened
by
the
neighbours
knocking
her
up
;
this
one
was
ill
,
and
that
body
's
child
was
restless
;
and
for
as
tired
as
ever
she
might
be
,
she
would
be
up
and
dressed
in
a
twinkling
,
never
thinking
of
the
hard
day
's
wash
afore
her
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Them
were
happy
times
!
 
<EOS>
How
pleased
I
used
to
be
when
she
would
take
me
into
the
fields
with
her
to
gather
herbs
!
 
<EOS>
I
've
tasted
tea
in
China
since
then
,
but
it
was
n't
half
so
good
as
the
herb
tea
she
used
to
make
for
me
o
'
Sunday
nights
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
knew
such
a
deal
about
plants
and
birds
,
and
their
ways
.
 
<EOS>
She
used
to
tell
me
long
stories
about
her
childhood
,
and
we
used
to
plan
how
we
would
go
some
time
,
please
God
(
that
was
always
her
word
)
,
and
live
near
her
old
home
beyond
Lancaster
;
in
the
very
cottage
where
she
was
born
,
if
we
could
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
!
<EOS>
and
how
different
it
is
!
 
<EOS>
Here
is
she
still
in
a
back
street
o
'
Manchester
,
never
likely
to
see
her
own
home
again
;
and
I
,
a
sailor
,
off
for
America
next
week
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
she
had
been
able
to
go
to
Burton
<EOS>
once
afore
she
died
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
maybe
have
found
all
sadly
changed
,
"
said
Mary
,
though
her
heart
echoed
Will
's
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
ay
!
<EOS>
I
dare
say
it
's
best
.
 
<EOS>
One
thing
I
do
wish
though
,
<EOS>
and
I
have
often
wished
it
when
out
alone
on
the
deep
sea
,
when
even
the
most
thoughtless
ca
n't
choose
but
think
on
th
'
past
and
th
'
future
;
and
that
is
,
that
I
'd
never
grieved
her
.
 
<EOS>
O
Mary
!
<EOS>
many
a
hasty
word
comes
sorely
back
on
the
heart
when
one
thinks
one
shall
never
see
the
person
whom
one
has
grieved
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
both
stood
thinking
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
Mary
started
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
father
's
step
.
 
<EOS>
And
his
shirt
's
not
ready
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
hurried
to
her
irons
,
and
tried
to
make
up
for
lost
time
.
  
<EOS>
John
Barton
came
in
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
haggard
and
wildly
anxious
-
looking
man
<EOS>
,
Will
thought
he
had
never
seen
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
Will
,
but
spoke
no
word
of
greeting
or
welcome
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
come
to
bid
you
good
-
bye
,
"
said
the
sailor
,
and
would
in
his
sociable
friendly
humour
have
gone
on
speaking
.
 
<EOS>
But
John
answered
abruptly
   
"
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
to
ye
,
then
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
that
in
his
manner
which
left
no
doubt
of
his
desire
to
get
rid
of
the
visitor
,
and
Will
accordingly
shook
hands
with
Mary
,
and
looked
at
John
,
as
if
doubting
how
far
to
offer
to
shake
hands
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
met
with
no
answering
glance
or
gesture
,
so
he
went
his
way
,
stopping
for
an
instant
at
the
door
to
say
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
think
on
me
on
Tuesday
,
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
day
we
shall
hoist
our
blue
Peter
,
Jack
Harris
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
Mary
was
heartily
sorry
when
the
door
closed
;
it
seemed
like
shutting
out
a
friendly
sunbeam
.
 
<EOS>
And
her
father
!
<EOS>
what
could
be
the
matter
with
him
?
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
restless
;
not
speaking
(
she
wished
he
would
)
,
but
starting
up
and
then
sitting
down
,
and
meddling
with
her
irons
;
he
seemed
so
fierce
,
too
,
to
judge
from
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
She
wondered
if
he
disliked
Will
being
there
;
or
if
he
were
vexed
to
find
that
she
had
not
got
further
on
with
her
work
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
she
could
bear
his
nervous
way
no
longer
,
it
made
her
equally
nervous
and
fidgety
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
are
you
going
,
father
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
the
time
<EOS>
o
'
the
trains
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
shouldst
thou
know
?
<EOS>
"
replied
he
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Meddle
with
thy
ironing
,
but
donnot
be
asking
questions
about
what
does
n't
concern
thee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wanted
to
get
you
something
to
eat
first
,
"
answered
she
gently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
dost
not
know
that
I
'm
larning
to
do
without
food
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
looked
at
him
to
see
if
he
spoke
jestingly
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
he
looked
savagely
grave
.
  
<EOS>
She
finished
her
bit
of
ironing
,
and
began
preparing
the
food
she
was
sure
her
father
needed
;
for
by
this
time
her
experience
in
the
degrees
of
hunger
had
taught
her
that
his
present
irritability
was
increased
,
if
not
caused
by
want
of
food
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
had
a
sovereign
given
him
to
pay
his
expenses
as
delegate
to
Glasgow
,
and
out
of
this
he
had
given
Mary
a
few
shillings
in
the
morning
;
so
she
had
been
able
to
buy
a
sufficient
meal
,
and
now
her
care
was
to
cook
it
so
as
to
tempt
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
thou'rt
doing
that
for
me
,
Mary
,
thou
mayst
spare
thy
labour
.
 
<EOS>
I
telled
thee
<EOS>
I
were
not
for
eating
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
a
little
bit
,
father
,
before
starting
,
"
coaxed
Mary
perseveringly
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
instant
who
should
come
in
<EOS>
but
Job
Legh
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
often
he
came
,
but
when
he
did
pay
visits
,
Mary
knew
from
past
experience
they
were
anything
but
short
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
's
countenance
fell
back
into
the
deep
gloom
from
which
it
was
but
just
emerging
at
the
sound
of
Mary
's
sweet
voice
,
and
pretty
pleading
.
 
<EOS>
He
became
again
restless
and
fidgety
,
scarcely
giving
Job
Legh
<EOS>
the
greeting
necessary
for
a
host
in
his
own
house
.
 
<EOS>
Job
,
however
,
did
not
stand
upon
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
come
to
pay
a
visit
,
and
was
not
to
be
daunted
from
his
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
interested
in
John
Barton
's
mission
to
Glasgow
,
and
wanted
to
hear
all
about
it
;
so
he
sat
down
,
and
made
himself
comfortable
,
in
a
manner
that
Mary
saw
was
meant
to
be
stationary
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
thou'rt
off
to
Glasgow
,
art
thou
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
began
his
catechism
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
art
starting
?
"
  
"
To
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
knowed
.
 
<EOS>
But
by
what
train
?
"
  
<EOS>
That
was
just
what
Mary
wanted
to
know
;
but
what
apparently
her
father
was
in
no
mood
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
He
got
up
without
speaking
,
and
went
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
knew
from
his
step
,
and
his
way
,
how
much
he
was
put
out
,
and
feared
Job
would
see
it
too
!
 
<EOS>
But
no
!
<EOS>
Job
seemed
imperturbable
.
 
<EOS>
So
much
the
better
,
and
perhaps
she
could
cover
her
father
's
rudeness
by
her
own
civility
to
so
kind
a
friend
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
half
-
listening
to
her
father
's
movements
upstairs
(
passionate
,
violent
,
restless
motions
they
were
)
,
and
half
-
attending
to
Job
Legh
<EOS>
,
she
tried
to
pay
him
all
due
regard
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
does
thy
father
start
,
Mary
?
"
  
<EOS>
That
plaguing
question
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
very
soon
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
just
getting
him
a
bit
of
supper
.
 
<EOS>
Is
Margaret
very
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
she
's
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
meaning
to
go
and
keep
Alice
Wilson
company
for
an
hour
or
so
this
evening
:
as
soon
as
she
thinks
her
nephew
will
have
started
for
Liverpool
;
for
she
fancies
the
old
woman
will
feel
a
bit
lonesome
.
 
<EOS>
Th
'
Union
is
paying
for
your
father
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
they
've
given
him
a
sovereign
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
one
of
th
'
Union
,
Job
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
I
'm
one
,
sure
enough
;
but
I
'm
but
a
sleeping
partner
in
the
concern
.
 
<EOS>
I
were
obliged
to
become
a
member
for
peace
,
else
I
do
n't
go
along
with
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Yo
see
they
think
themselves
wise
,
and
me
silly
,
for
differing
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
there
's
no
harm
in
that
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
they
wo
n't
let
me
be
silly
in
peace
and
quietness
,
but
will
force
me
to
be
as
wise
as
they
are
;
now
that
's
not
British
liberty
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
I
'm
forced
to
be
wise
according
to
their
notions
,
else
they
parsecute
me
,
and
sarve
me
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
What
could
her
father
be
doing
upstairs
?
 
<EOS>
Tramping
and
banging
about
.
 
<EOS>
Why
did
he
not
come
down
?
 
<EOS>
Or
why
did
not
Job
go
?
 
<EOS>
The
supper
would
be
spoilt
.
  
<EOS>
But
Job
had
no
notion
of
going
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
my
folly
is
this
,
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
take
what
I
could
get
;
I
think
half
a
loaf
is
better
than
no
bread
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
work
for
low
wages
rather
than
sit
idle
and
starve
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
comes
the
Trades
'
Union
,
and
says
,
"
Well
,
if
you
take
the
half
-
loaf
,
we
'll
worry
you
out
of
your
life
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
be
clemmed
,
or
will
you
be
worried
?
<EOS>
"
Now
clemming
is
a
quiet
death
,
and
worrying
is
n't
,
so
I
choose
clemming
,
and
come
into
th
'
Union
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'd
wish
they
'd
leave
me
free
,
if
I
am
a
fool
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Creak
,
creak
,
went
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
was
coming
down
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
came
down
,
but
more
doggedly
fierce
than
before
,
and
made
up
for
his
journey
,
too
;
with
his
little
bundle
on
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
up
to
Job
,
and
,
more
civilly
than
Mary
expected
,
wished
him
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
He
then
turned
to
her
,
and
in
a
short
cold
manner
,
bade
her
farewell
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
father
,
do
n't
go
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Your
supper
is
all
ready
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
one
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
he
pushed
her
away
,
and
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
She
followed
him
to
the
door
<EOS>
,
her
eyes
blinded
by
sudden
tears
;
she
stood
there
looking
after
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
strange
,
so
cold
,
so
hard
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
at
the
end
of
the
court
,
he
turned
,
and
saw
her
standing
there
;
he
came
back
quickly
,
and
took
her
in
his
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
thee
,
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
God
in
heaven
bless
thee
,
poor
child
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
go
yet
,
father
;
I
ca
n't
bear
you
to
go
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Come
in
,
and
eat
some
supper
<EOS>
;
you
look
so
ghastly
;
dear
father
,
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
said
,
faintly
and
mournfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
best
as
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
eat
,
and
it
's
best
to
be
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
still
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
moving
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
unlaced
her
soft
twining
arms
,
and
kissing
her
once
more
,
set
off
on
his
fierce
errand
.
  
<EOS>
And
he
was
out
of
sight
!
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
know
why
,
but
she
had
never
before
felt
so
depressed
,
so
desolate
.
 
<EOS>
She
turned
in
to
Job
,
who
sat
there
still
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
,
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
sight
,
slackened
his
pace
,
and
fell
into
that
heavy
listless
step
which
told
,
as
well
as
words
could
do
,
of
hopelessness
and
weakness
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
getting
dark
,
but
he
loitered
on
,
returning
no
greeting
to
any
one
.
  
<EOS>
A
child
's
cry
caught
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
His
thoughts
were
running
on
little
Tom
;
on
the
dead
and
buried
child
of
happier
years
.
 
<EOS>
He
followed
the
sound
of
the
wail
,
that
might
have
been
HIS
,
and
found
a
poor
little
mortal
,
who
had
lost
his
way
,
and
whose
grief
had
choked
up
his
thoughts
to
the
single
want
,
"
Mammy
,
mammy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
tender
address
,
John
Barton
soothed
the
little
laddie
,
and
with
beautiful
patience
he
gathered
fragments
of
meaning
from
the
half
-
spoken
words
which
came
mingled
with
sobs
from
the
terrified
little
heart
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
aided
by
inquiries
here
and
there
from
a
passer
-
by
,
he
led
and
carried
the
little
fellow
home
,
where
his
mother
had
been
too
busy
to
miss
him
,
but
now
received
him
with
thankfulness
,
and
with
an
eloquent
Irish
blessing
.
 
<EOS>
When
John
heard
the
words
of
blessing
,
he
shook
his
head
mournfully
and
turned
away
to
retrace
his
steps
.
  
<EOS>
Let
us
leave
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
took
her
sewing
after
he
had
gone
,
and
sat
on
,
and
sat
on
,
trying
to
listen
to
Job
,
who
was
more
inclined
to
talk
than
usual
.
<EOS>
She
had
conquered
her
feeling
of
impatience
towards
him
so
far
as
to
be
able
to
offer
him
her
father
's
rejected
supper
;
and
she
even
tried
to
eat
herself
.
 
<EOS>
But
her
heart
failed
her
.
 
<EOS>
A
leaden
weight
seemed
to
hang
over
her
;
a
sort
of
presentiment
of
evil
,
or
perhaps
only
an
excess
of
low
-
spirited
feeling
in
consequence
of
the
two
departures
which
had
taken
place
that
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
She
wondered
how
long
Job
Legh
would
sit
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
like
putting
down
her
work
,
and
crying
before
him
,
and
yet
<EOS>
she
had
never
in
her
life
longed
so
much
to
be
alone
in
order
to
indulge
in
a
good
hearty
burst
of
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mary
,
"
she
suddenly
caught
him
saying
,
"
I
thought
you
'd
be
a
bit
lonely
to
-
night
;
and
as
Margaret
were
going
to
cheer
th
'
old
woman
,
I
said
I
'd
go
and
keep
th
'
young
un
company
;
and
a
very
pleasant
chatty
evening
we
've
had
;
<EOS>
very
.
 
<EOS>
Only
I
wonder
as
Margaret
is
not
come
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
perhaps
she
is
,
"
suggested
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
I
took
care
o
'
that
.
 
<EOS>
Look
ye
here
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
he
pulled
out
the
great
house
-
key
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
'll
have
to
stand
waiting
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
street
,
and
that
I
'm
sure
she
would
n't
do
,
when
she
knew
where
to
find
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
she
come
back
by
hersel
?
"
asked
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
I
were
afraid
o
'
trusting
her
,
and
I
used
to
follow
her
a
bit
behind
;
never
letting
on
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
bless
you
!
<EOS>
she
goes
along
as
steadily
as
can
be
;
rather
slow
to
be
sure
,
and
her
head
a
bit
on
one
side
,
as
if
she
were
listening
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
's
real
beautiful
to
see
her
cross
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
She
'll
wait
above
a
bit
to
hear
that
all
is
still
;
not
that
she
's
so
dark
as
not
to
see
a
coach
or
a
cart
like
a
big
black
thing
,
but
she
ca
n't
rightly
judge
how
far
off
it
is
by
sight
,
so
she
listens
.
 
<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
that
's
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
Yes
;
in
she
came
,
with
her
usually
calm
face
all
tear
-
stained
and
sorrow
-
marked
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
,
my
wench
?
"
said
Job
hastily
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
grandfather
!
 
<EOS>
Alice
Wilson
's
so
bad
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
could
say
no
more
for
her
breathless
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
The
afternoon
,
and
the
parting
with
Will
,
had
weakened
her
nerves
for
any
after
-
shock
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Do
tell
us
,
Margaret
!
"
said
Mary
,
placing
her
in
a
chair
,
and
loosening
her
bonnet
-
strings
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
's
<EOS>
a
stroke
o
'
the
palsy
.
 
<EOS>
Any
rate
she
has
lost
the
use
of
one
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
afore
Will
set
off
?
"
asked
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
were
gone
before
I
got
there
,
"
said
Margaret
;
"
and
she
were
much
about
as
well
as
she
has
been
for
many
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
She
spoke
a
bit
,
but
not
much
;
but
that
were
only
natural
,
for
Mrs.
Wilson
likes
to
have
the
talk
to
hersel
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
She
got
up
to
go
across
the
room
,
and
then
I
heard
a
drag
wi
'
her
leg
,
and
presently
a
fall
,
and
Mrs.
Wilson
came
running
,
and
set
up
such
a
cry
!
 
<EOS>
I
stopped
wi
'
Alice
,
while
she
fetched
a
doctor
;
but
she
could
not
speak
,
to
answer
me
,
though
she
tried
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
was
Jem
?
 
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
he
go
for
the
doctor
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
were
out
when
I
got
there
,
and
he
never
came
home
while
I
stopped
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Thou'st
never
left
Mrs.
Wilson
alone
wi
'
poor
Alice
?
"
asked
Job
hastily
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Margaret
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
oh
!
<EOS>
grandfather
,
it
's
now
<EOS>
I
feel
how
hard
it
is
to
have
lost
my
sight
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
so
loved
to
nurse
her
;
and
I
did
try
,
until
I
found
I
did
more
harm
than
good
.
 
<EOS>
O
grandfather
;
if
I
could
but
see
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
sobbed
a
little
;
and
they
let
her
give
that
ease
to
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Then
she
went
on
   
"
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
I
went
round
by
Mrs.
Davenport
's
,
and
she
were
hard
at
work
;
but
,
the
minute
I
told
my
errand
<EOS>
,
she
were
ready
and
willing
to
go
to
Jane
Wilson
,
and
stop
up
all
night
with
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
does
the
doctor
say
?
"
asked
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
much
what
all
doctors
say
:
he
puts
a
fence
on
this
side
,
and
a
fence
on
that
,
for
fear
he
should
be
caught
tripping
in
his
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
One
moment
he
does
not
think
there
's
much
hope
 
<EOS>
but
while
there
is
life
there
is
hope
!
<EOS>
th
'
next
he
says
he
should
think
she
might
recover
partial
 
<EOS>
but
her
age
is
again
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
ordered
her
leeches
to
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Margaret
having
told
her
tale
,
leant
back
with
weariness
,
both
of
body
and
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
hastened
to
make
her
a
cup
of
tea
;
while
Job
,
lately
so
talkative
,
sat
quiet
and
mournfully
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
first
thing
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
learn
how
she
is
;
and
I
'll
bring
word
back
before
I
go
to
work
,

's

"
Jane
does
not
think
she
knows
any
one

"
replied
Margaret
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
perhaps
<EOS>
as
well
he
should
n't
see
her
now
for
they
say
her
face
is
sadly
drawn
.
 
<EOS>
He
'll
remember
her
with
her
own
face
better
,
if
he
does
not
see
her
again

"
  
<EOS>
With
a
few
more
sorrowful
remarks
they
separated
for
the
night
,
and
Mary
was
left
alone
in
her
house
,
to
meditate
on
the
heavy
day
that
had
passed
over
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
seemed
going
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
Will
gone
;
her
father
gone
 
and
so
strangely
too
!
 
<EOS>
And
to
a
place
so
mysteriously
distant
as
Glasgow
seemed
to
be
to
her
!
 
<EOS>
She
had
felt
his
presence
as
a
protection
against
Harry
Carson
and
his
threats
;
and
now
she
dreaded
lest
he
should
learn
she
was
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Her
heart
began
to
despair
,
too
,
about
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
She
feared
he
had
ceased
to
love
her
;
and
she
 
<EOS>
she
only
loved
him
more
and
more
for
his
seeming
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
as
if
all
this
aggregate
of
sorrowful
thoughts
was
not
enough
,
here
was
this
new
woe
,
of
poor
Alice
's
paralytic
stroke
.
   
<EOS>
MURDER
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
in
his
pulse
there
was
no
throb
,
Nor
on
his
lips
one
dying
sob
;
<EOS>
Sigh
,
nor
word
,
nor
struggling
breath
Heralded
his
way
to
death
.

<EOS>
I
must
now
go
back
to
an
hour
or
two
before
Mary
and
her
friends
parted
for
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
be
about
eight
o'clock
that
evening
,
and
the
three
Miss
Carsons
were
sitting
in
their
father
's
drawing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
asleep
in
the
dining
-
room
,
in
his
own
comfortable
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carson
was
(
as
was
usual
with
her
,
when
no
particular
excitement
was
going
on
)
very
poorly
,
and
sitting
upstairs
in
her
dressing
-
room
,
indulging
in
the
luxury
of
a
headache
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
not
well
,
certainly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wind
in
the
head
,
"
the
servants
called
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
<EOS>
but
the
natural
consequence
of
the
state
of
mental
and
bodily
idleness
in
which
she
was
placed
.
<EOS>
Without
education
enough
to
value
the
resources
of
wealth
and
leisure
,
she
was
so
circumstanced
as
to
command
both
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
done
her
more
good
than
all
the
ether
and
sal
-
volatile
<EOS>
she
was
daily
in
the
habit
of
swallowing
,
if
she
might
have
taken
the
work
of
one
of
her
own
housemaids
for
a
week
;
made
beds
,
rubbed
tables
,
shaken
carpets
,
and
gone
out
into
the
fresh
morning
air
,
without
all
the
paraphernalia
of
shawl
,
cloak
,
boa
,
fur
boots
,
bonnet
,
and
veil
,
in
which
she
was
equipped
before
setting
out
for
an
"
airing
,
"
in
the
closely
shut
-
up
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
So
the
three
girls
were
by
themselves
in
the
comfortable
,
elegant
,
well
-
lighted
drawing
-
room
;
and
,
like
many
similarly
situated
young
ladies
,
they
did
not
exactly
know
what
to
do
to
while
away
the
time
until
the
tea
-
hour
.
 
<EOS>
The
elder
two
had
been
at
a
dancing
-
party
the
night
before
,
and
were
listless
and
sleepy
in
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
One
tried
to
read
"
Emerson
's
Essays
,
"
and
fell
asleep
in
the
attempt
;
the
other
was
turning
over
a
parcel
of
new
songs
,
in
order
to
select
what
she
liked
.
 
<EOS>
Amy
,
the
youngest
,
was
copying
some
manuscript
music
.
 
<EOS>
The
air
was
heavy
with
the
fragrance
of
strongly
-
scented
flowers
,
which
sent
out
their
night
odours
from
an
adjoining
conservatory
.
  
<EOS>
The
clock
on
the
chimney
-
piece
chimed
eight
.
 
<EOS>
Sophy
(
the
sleeping
sister
)
started
up
at
the
sound
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
o'clock
is
that
?
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eight
,
"
said
<EOS>
Amy
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
dear
!
<EOS>
how
tired
I
am
!
 
<EOS>
Is
Harry
come
in
?
 
<EOS>
Tea
will
rouse
one
up
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
not
worn
out
,
Helen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
am
tired
enough
.
 
<EOS>
One
is
good
for
nothing
the
day
after
a
dance
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
do
n't
feel
weary
at
the
time
;
I
suppose
it
is
the
lateness
of
the
hours
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
yet
,
how
could
it
be
managed
otherwise
?
 
<EOS>
So
many
do
n't
dine
till
five
or
six
,
that
one
can
not
begin
before
eight
or
nine
;
and
then
it
takes
a
long
time
to
get
into
the
spirit
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
always
more
pleasant
after
supper
than
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'm
too
tired
to
-
night
to
reform
the
world
in
the
matter
of
dances
or
balls
.
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
copying
,
Amy
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Only
that
little
Spanish
air
you
sing
,
"
Quien
quiera
.
"
  
"
What
are
you
copying
it
for
?
"
asked
Helen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Harry
asked
me
to
do
it
for
him
this
morning
at
breakfast
-
time
 
for
Miss
Richardson
,
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
For
Jane
Richardson
!
"
said
Sophy
,
as
if
a
new
idea
were
receiving
strength
in
her
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
Harry
means
anything
by
his
attention
to
her
?
"
asked
Helen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
do
not
know
anything
more
than
you
do
;
I
can
only
observe
and
conjecture
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
,
Helen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Harry
always
likes
to
be
of
consequence
to
the
belle
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
If
one
girl
is
more
admired
than
another
,
he
likes
to
flutter
about
her
,
and
seem
to
be
on
intimate
terms
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
his
way
,
and
I
have
not
noticed
anything
beyond
that
in
his
manner
to
Jane
Richardson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
think
she
knows
it
's
only
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
Just
watch
her
the
next
time
we
meet
her
when
Harry
is
there
,
and
see
how
she
crimsons
,
and
looks
another
way
when
she
feels
he
is
coming
up
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
sees
it
,
too
,
and
I
think
he
is
pleased
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
Harry
would
like
well
enough
to
turn
the
head
of
such
a
lovely
girl
as
Jane
Richardson
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'm
not
convinced
that
he
's
in
love
,
whatever
she
may
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
!
"
said
Sophy
indignantly
,
"
though
it
is
our
own
brother
,
I
do
not
think
he
is
behaving
very
wrongly
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
I
think
of
it
,
the
more
sure
I
am
that
she
thinks
he
means
something
,
and
that
he
intends
her
to
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
when
he
leaves
off
paying
her
attention
"
    
"
Which
will
be
as
soon
as
a
prettier
girl
makes
her
appearance
,
"
interrupted
Helen
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
he
leaves
off
paying
her
attention
,
"
resumed
Sophy
,
"
she
will
have
many
and
many
a
heartache
,
and
then
she
will
harden
herself
into
being
a
flirt
,
a
feminine
flirt
,
as
he
is
a
masculine
flirt
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
girl
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
to
hear
you
speak
so
of
Harry
,
"
said
Amy
,
looking
up
at
Sophy
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
do
n't
like
to
have
to
speak
so
,
Amy
,
<EOS>
for
I
love
him
dearly
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
good
,
kind
brother
,
but
I
do
think
him
vain
,
and
I
think
he
hardly
knows
the
misery
,
the
crime
,
to
which
indulged
vanity
may
lead
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Helen
yawned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
do
you
think
we
may
ring
for
tea
?
 
<EOS>
Sleeping
after
dinner
makes
me
so
feverish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
surely
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
not
we
?
"
said
the
more
energetic
Sophy
,
pulling
the
bell
with
some
determination
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tea
,
directly
,
Parker
,
"
said
she
authoritatively
,
as
the
man
entered
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
too
little
in
the
habit
of
reading
expressions
on
the
faces
of
others
to
notice
Parker
's
countenance
,
  
<EOS>
Yet
it
was
striking
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
blanched
to
a
dead
whiteness
;
the
lips
compressed
as
if
to
keep
within
some
tale
of
horror
;
the
eyes
distended
and
unnatural
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
terror
-
stricken
face
.
  
<EOS>
The
girls
began
to
put
away
their
music
and
books
,
in
preparation
for
tea
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
slowly
opened
again
,
and
this
time
it
was
the
nurse
who
entered
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
her
nurse
,
for
such
had
been
her
office
in
bygone
days
,
though
now
she
held
rather
an
anomalous
situation
in
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
Seamstress
,
attendant
on
the
young
ladies
,
keeper
of
the
stores
;
only
"
Nurse
"
was
still
her
name
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
lived
longer
with
them
than
any
other
servant
,
and
to
her
their
manner
was
far
less
haughty
than
to
the
other
domestics
.
 
<EOS>
She
occasionally
came
into
the
drawing
-
room
to
look
for
things
belonging
to
their
father
or
mother
,
so
it
did
not
excite
any
surprise
when
she
advanced
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
They
went
on
arranging
their
various
articles
of
employment
.
  
<EOS>
She
wanted
them
to
look
up
.
 
<EOS>
She
wanted
them
to
read
something
in
her
face
 
<EOS>
her
face
<EOS>
so
full
of
woe
,
of
horror
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
went
on
without
taking
any
notice
.
 
<EOS>
She
coughed
;
not
a
natural
cough
;
but
one
of
those
coughs
which
asks
so
plainly
for
remark
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
nurse
,
what
is
the
matter
?
"
asked
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
not
you
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Is
mamma
ill
?
"
asked
Sophy
quickly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
,
speak
,
nurse
!
"
said
they
all
,
as
they
saw
her
efforts
to
articulate
choked
by
the
convulsive
rising
in
her
throat
.
 
<EOS>
They
clustered
round
her
with
eager
faces
,
catching
a
glimpse
of
some
terrible
truth
to
be
revealed
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
young
ladies
!
<EOS>
my
dear
girls
!
<EOS>
"
she
gasped
out
at
length
,
and
then
she
burst
into
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
do
tell
us
what
it
is
,
nurse
!
"
said
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
Anything
is
better
than
this
.
 
<EOS>
Speak
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
children
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
to
break
it
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
My
dears
,
poor
Mr.
Harry
is
brought
home
"
    
<EOS>
"
Brought
home
 
BROUGHT
home
 
how
?
"
 
<EOS>
Instinctively
they
sank
their
voices
to
a
whisper
;
but
a
fearful
whisper
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
same
low
tone
,
as
if
afraid
lest
the
walls
,
<EOS>
the
furniture
,
the
inanimate
things
which
told
of
preparation
for
life
and
comfort
,
should
hear
,
she
answered
   
"
<EOS>
Dead
!
"
  
<EOS>
Amy
clutched
her
nurse
's
arm
,
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
her
as
if
to
know
if
such
a
tale
could
be
true
;
and
when
she
read
its
confirmation
in
those
sad
,
mournful
,
unflinching
eyes
,
she
sank
,
without
word
or
sound
,
down
in
a
faint
upon
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
One
sister
sat
down
on
an
ottoman
,
and
covered
her
face
,
to
try
and
realise
it
.
<EOS>
That
was
Sophy
.
 
<EOS>
Helen
threw
herself
on
the
sofa
,
and
burying
her
head
in
the
pillows
,
tried
to
stifle
the
screams
and
moans
which
shook
her
frame
.
  
<EOS>
The
nurse
stood
silent
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
not
told
ALL
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
"
said
Sophy
,
looking
up
,
and
speaking
in
a
hoarse
voice
,
which
told
of
the
inward
pain
,
"
tell
me
,
nurse
!
 
<EOS>
Is
he
DEAD
,
did
you
say
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
sent
for
a
doctor
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
send
for
one
,
send
for
one
,
"
continued
she
,
her
voice
rising
to
shrillness
,
and
starting
to
her
feet
.
 
<EOS>
Helen
lifted
herself
up
,
and
looked
,
with
breathless
waiting
,
towards
nurse
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dears
,
he
is
dead
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
sent
for
a
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
done
all
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
did
he
 
when
did
they
bring
him
home
?
"
asked
Sophy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
ten
minutes
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Before
you
rang
for
Parker
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
did
he
die
?
 
<EOS>
Where
did
they
find
him
?
 
<EOS>
He
looked
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
seemed
so
strong
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
are
you
sure
he
is
dead
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
went
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Nurse
laid
her
hand
on
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Sophy
,
I
have
not
told
you
all
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
bear
to
hear
it
?
<EOS>
Remember
,
master
is
in
the
next
room
,
and
he
knows
nothing
yet
.
<EOS>
Come
,
you
must
help
me
to
tell
him
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
be
quiet
,
dear
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
no
common
death
<EOS>
he
died
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
looked
in
her
face
as
if
trying
to
convey
her
meaning
by
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
Sophy
's
lips
moved
,
but
nurse
could
hear
no
sound
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
shot
as
he
was
coming
home
along
Turner
Street
,
to
-
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sophy
went
on
with
the
motion
of
her
lips
,
twitching
them
almost
convulsively
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
must
rouse
yourself
,
and
remember
your
father
and
mother
have
yet
to
be
told
.
 
<EOS>
Speak
!
<EOS>
Miss
Sophy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
she
could
not
;
her
whole
face
worked
involuntarily
.
 
<EOS>
The
nurse
left
the
room
,
and
almost
immediately
brought
back
some
sal
-
volatile
and
water
.
 
<EOS>
Sophy
drank
it
eagerly
,
and
gave
one
or
two
deep
gasps
.
<EOS>
Then
she
spoke
in
a
calm
,
unnatural
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
me
to
do
,
nurse
?
 
<EOS>
Go
to
Helen
and
poor
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
See
,
they
want
help
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
creatures
!
<EOS>
we
must
let
them
alone
for
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
go
to
master
;
that
's
what
I
want
you
to
do
,
Miss
Sophy
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
break
it
to
him
,
poor
old
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
Come
,
he
's
asleep
in
the
dining
-
room
,
and
the
men
are
waiting
to
speak
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sophy
went
mechanically
to
the
dining
-
room
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
go
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
him
.
 
<EOS>
What
must
I
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
'll
come
with
you
,
Miss
Sophy
.
 
<EOS>
Break
it
to
him
by
degrees
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
,
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
My
head
throbs
<EOS>
so
,
I
shall
be
sure
to
say
the
wrong
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
However
,
she
opened
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
There
sat
her
father
,
the
shaded
light
of
the
candle
-
lamp
falling
upon
,
and
softening
his
marked
features
,
while
his
snowy
hair
contrasted
well
with
the
deep
crimson
morocco
of
the
chair
.
 
<EOS>
The
newspaper
he
had
been
reading
had
dropped
on
the
carpet
by
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
breathed
regularly
and
deeply
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
instant
the
words
of
Mrs.
Hemans
's
song
came
full
in
Sophy
's
mind
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ye
know
not
what
ye
do
,
That
call
the
slumberer
back
From
the
realms
unseen
by
you
,
To
life
's
dim
weary
track
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
this
life
's
track
would
be
to
the
bereaved
father
something
more
than
dim
and
weary
,
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
"
said
she
softly
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
stir
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
somewhat
louder
.
  
<EOS>
He
started
up
,
half
awake
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tea
is
ready
,
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
and
he
yawned
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
papa
,
but
something
very
dreadful
 
very
sad
,
has
happened
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
gaping
so
loud
that
he
did
not
catch
the
words
she
uttered
,
and
did
not
see
the
expression
of
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Master
Henry
has
not
come
back
,
"
said
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
Her
voice
,
heard
in
unusual
speech
to
him
,
arrested
his
attention
,
and
rubbing
his
eyes
,
he
looked
at
the
servant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Harry
!
<EOS>
oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
he
had
to
attend
a
meeting
of
the
masters
about
these
cursed
turn
-
outs
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
expect
him
yet
.
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
looking
at
me
so
strangely
for
,
Sophy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
papa
,
Harry
is
come
back
,
"
said
she
,
bursting
into
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
said
he
,
startled
into
an
impatient
consciousness
that
something
was
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
of
you
says
he
is
not
come
home
,
and
the
other
says
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
that
's
nonsense
!
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
at
once
<EOS>
what
's
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Did
he
go
on
horseback
to
town
?
 
<EOS>
Is
he
thrown
?
 
<EOS>
Speak
,
child
,
ca
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
<EOS>
he
's
not
been
thrown
,
papa
,
"
said
Sophy
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
's
badly
hurt
,
"
put
in
the
nurse
,
desirous
to
be
drawing
his
anxiety
to
a
point
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hurt
?
 
<EOS>
Where
?
 
<EOS>
How
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
sent
for
a
doctor
?
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
hastily
rising
,
as
if
to
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
papa
,
we
've
sent
for
a
doctor
 
<EOS>
but
I
'm
afraid
 
<EOS>
I
believe
it
's
of
no
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
,
and
in
her
face
he
read
the
truth
.
<EOS>
His
son
,
his
only
son
,
was
dead
.
  
<EOS>
He
sank
back
in
his
chair
,
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
,
and
bowed
his
head
upon
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
The
strong
mahogany
dining
-
table
shook
and
rattled
under
his
agony
.
  
<EOS>
Sophy
went
and
put
her
arms
round
his
bowed
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
!
<EOS>
you
are
not
Harry
,
"
said
he
;
but
the
action
roused
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
<EOS>
where
is
the
"
 
s
aid
<EOS>
he
,
with
his
strong
face
set
into
the
lines
of
anguish
,
by
two
minutes
of
such
intense
woe
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
servants
'
hall
,
"
said
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
"
Two
policemen
and
another
man
brought
him
home
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
be
glad
to
speak
to
you
when
you
are
able
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
now
able
,
"
replied
he
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
when
he
stood
up
he
tottered
.
<EOS>
But
steadying
himself
,
he
walked
,
as
firmly
as
a
soldier
on
drill
,
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
turned
back
and
poured
out
a
glass
of
wine
from
the
decanter
which
yet
remained
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
His
eye
caught
the
wine
-
glass
which
Harry
had
used
but
two
or
three
hours
before
.
<EOS>
He
sighed
a
long
quivering
sigh
,
and
then
mastering
himself
again
,
he
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
go
back
to
your
sisters
,
Miss
Sophy
,
"
said
nurse
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Carson
went
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
face
death
yet
.
  
<EOS>
The
nurse
followed
Mr.
Carson
to
the
servants
'
hall
.
 
<EOS>
There
on
their
dinner
-
table
lay
the
poor
dead
body
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
who
had
brought
it
were
sitting
near
the
fire
,
while
several
of
the
servants
stood
round
the
table
,
gazing
at
the
remains
.
  
<EOS>
THE
REMAINS
!
  
<EOS>
One
or
two
were
crying
;
one
or
two
were
whispering
;
awed
into
a
strange
stillness
of
voice
and
action
by
the
presence
of
the
dead
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Carson
came
in
they
all
drew
back
and
looked
at
him
with
the
reverence
due
to
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
forward
and
gazed
long
and
fondly
on
the
calm
,
dead
face
;
then
he
bent
down
and
kissed
the
lips
yet
crimson
with
life
.
 
<EOS>
The
policemen
had
advanced
,
and
stood
ready
to
be
questioned
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
first
the
old
man
's
mind
could
only
take
in
the
idea
of
death
;
slowly
,
slowly
came
the
conception
of
violence
,
of
murder
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
did
he
die
?
<EOS>
"
he
groaned
forth
.
  
<EOS>
The
policemen
looked
at
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
Then
one
began
,
and
stated
that
having
heard
the
report
of
a
gun
in
Turner
Street
,
he
had
turned
down
that
way
(
a
lonely
,
unfrequented
way
Mr.
Carson
knew
,
but
a
short
cut
to
his
garden
door
,
of
which
Harry
had
a
key
)
;
that
as
he
(
the
policeman
)
came
nearer
,
he
had
heard
footsteps
as
of
a
man
running
away
;
but
the
evening
was
so
dark
(
the
moon
not
having
yet
risen
)
that
he
could
see
no
one
twenty
yards
off
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
had
even
been
startled
when
close
to
the
body
by
seeing
it
lying
across
the
path
at
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
had
sprung
his
rattle
;
and
when
another
policeman
came
up
,
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
they
had
discovered
who
it
was
that
had
been
killed
.
 
<EOS>
That
they
believed
him
to
be
dead
when
they
first
took
him
up
,
as
he
had
never
moved
,
spoken
,
or
breathed
.
 
<EOS>
That
intelligence
of
the
murder
had
been
sent
to
the
superintendent
,
who
would
probably
soon
be
here
.
 
<EOS>
That
two
or
three
policemen
were
still
about
the
place
where
the
murder
was
committed
,
seeking
out
for
some
trace
of
the
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
Having
said
this
,
they
stopped
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
had
listened
attentively
,
never
taking
his
eyes
off
the
dead
body
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
had
ended
,
he
said
   
<EOS>
"
Where
was
he
shot
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
lifted
up
some
of
the
thick
chestnut
curls
,
and
showed
a
blue
spot
(
you
could
hardly
call
it
a
hole
,
the
flesh
had
closed
so
much
over
it
)
in
the
left
temple
.
 
<EOS>
A
deadly
aim
!
<EOS>
And
yet
it
was
so
dark
a
night
!
  
<EOS>
"
He
must
have
been
close
upon
him
,
"
said
one
policeman
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
have
had
him
between
him
and
the
sky
,
"
added
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
commotion
at
the
door
of
the
room
,
and
there
stood
poor
Mrs.
Carson
,
the
mother
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
heard
unusual
noises
in
the
house
,
and
had
sent
down
her
maid
(
much
more
a
companion
to
her
than
her
highly
-
educated
daughters
)
to
discover
what
was
going
on
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
maid
either
forgot
,
or
dreaded
,
to
return
;
and
with
nervous
impatience
Mrs.
Carson
came
down
herself
,
and
had
traced
the
hum
and
buzz
of
voices
to
the
servants
'
hall
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
turned
round
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
leave
the
dead
for
any
one
living
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
her
away
,
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
no
sight
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
Miss
Sophy
to
go
to
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
again
fixed
on
the
dead
face
of
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
Mrs.
Carson
's
hysterical
cries
were
heard
all
over
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Her
husband
shuddered
at
the
outward
expression
of
the
agony
which
was
rending
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Then
the
police
superintendent
came
,
and
after
him
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
went
through
all
the
forms
of
ascertaining
death
,
without
uttering
a
word
,
and
when
at
the
conclusion
of
the
operation
of
opening
a
vein
,
from
which
no
blood
flowed
,
he
shook
his
head
,
all
present
understood
the
confirmation
of
their
previous
belief
.
 
<EOS>
The
superintendent
asked
to
speak
to
Mr.
Carson
in
private
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
just
what
I
was
going
to
request
of
you
,
"
answered
he
;
so
he
led
the
way
into
the
dining
-
room
,
with
the
wine
-
glass
still
on
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
The
door
was
carefully
shut
,
and
both
sat
down
,
each
apparently
waiting
for
the
other
to
begin
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
Mr.
Carson
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
probably
have
heard
that
I
am
a
rich
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
superintendent
bowed
in
assent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
half
 
nay
,
if
necessary
,
the
whole
of
my
fortune
I
will
give
to
have
the
murderer
brought
to
the
gallows
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Every
exertion
,
you
may
be
sure
,
sir
,
shall
be
used
on
our
part
;
but
probably
offering
a
handsome
reward
might
accelerate
the
discovery
of
the
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
I
wanted
particularly
to
tell
you
,
sir
,
is
that
one
of
my
men
has
already
got
some
clue
,
and
that
another
(
who
accompanied
me
here
)
has
within
this
quarter
of
an
hour
found
a
gun
in
the
field
which
the
murderer
crossed
,
and
which
he
probably
threw
away
when
pursued
,
as
encumbering
his
flight
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
smallest
doubt
of
discovering
the
murderer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
call
a
handsome
reward
?
"
said
Mr.
Carson
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
three
,
or
five
hundred
pounds
is
a
munificent
reward
:
more
than
will
probably
be
required
as
a
temptation
to
any
accomplice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Make
it
a
thousand
,
"
said
Mr.
Carson
decisively
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
doing
of
those
damned
turn
-
outs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
imagine
not
,
"
said
the
superintendent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Some
days
ago
the
man
I
was
naming
to
you
before
,
reported
to
the
inspector
when
he
came
on
his
beat
,
that
he
had
to
separate
your
son
from
a
young
man
,
who
by
his
dress
he
believed
to
be
employed
in
a
foundry
;
that
the
man
had
thrown
Mr.
Carson
down
,
and
seemed
inclined
to
proceed
to
more
violence
,
when
the
policeman
came
up
and
interfered
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
my
man
wished
to
give
him
in
charge
for
an
assault
,
but
Mr.
Carson
would
not
allow
that
to
be
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
like
him
!
 
<EOS>
noble
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
the
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
after
your
son
had
left
,
the
man
made
use
of
some
pretty
strong
threats
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
's
rather
a
curious
coincidence
that
this
scuffle
took
place
in
the
very
same
spot
where
the
murder
was
committed
;
in
Turner
Street
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
some
one
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Sophy
,
who
beckoned
her
father
out
,
and
then
asked
him
,
in
an
awestruck
whisper
,
to
come
upstairs
and
speak
to
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
not
leave
Harry
,
and
talks
so
strangely
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
 
indeed
 
papa
,
I
think
she
has
lost
her
senses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
the
poor
girl
sobbed
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
she
?
"
asked
Mr.
Carson
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
his
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
went
upstairs
rapidly
and
silently
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
large
comfortable
bedroom
;
too
large
to
be
well
lighted
by
the
flaring
,
flickering
kitchen
-
candle
which
had
been
hastily
snatched
up
,
and
now
stood
on
the
dressing
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
bed
,
surrounded
by
its
heavy
,
pall
-
like
green
curtains
,
lay
the
dead
son
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
carried
him
up
,
and
laid
him
down
,
as
tenderly
as
though
they
feared
to
waken
him
;
and
,
indeed
,
it
looked
more
like
sleep
than
death
,
so
very
calm
and
full
of
repose
was
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
You
saw
,
too
,
the
chiselled
beauty
of
the
features
much
more
perfectly
than
when
the
brilliant
colouring
of
life
had
distracted
your
attention
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
peace
about
him
which
told
that
death
had
come
too
instantaneously
to
give
any
previous
pain
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
chair
,
at
the
head
of
the
bed
,
sat
the
mother
 
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
She
held
one
of
the
hands
(
rapidly
stiffening
,
even
in
her
warm
grasp
)
,
and
gently
stroked
the
back
of
it
,
with
the
endearing
caress
she
had
used
to
all
her
children
when
young
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
are
come
,
"
said
she
,
looking
up
at
her
husband
,
and
still
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Harry
is
so
full
of
fun
,
he
always
has
something
new
to
amuse
us
with
;
and
now
he
pretends
he
is
asleep
,
and
that
we
ca
n't
waken
him
.
 
<EOS>
Look
!
<EOS>
he
is
smiling
now
;
he
hears
I
have
found
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
Look
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
,
in
truth
,
the
lips
,
in
the
rest
of
death
,
did
look
as
though
they
wore
a
smile
,
and
the
waving
light
of
the
unsnuffed
candle
almost
made
them
seem
to
move
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
,
Amy
,
"
said
she
to
her
youngest
child
,
who
knelt
at
her
feet
,
trying
to
soothe
her
,
by
kissing
her
garments
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
was
always
a
rogue
!
 
<EOS>
You
remember
,
do
n't
you
,
love
?
<EOS>
how
full
of
play
he
was
as
a
baby
;
hiding
his
face
under
my
arm
,
when
you
wanted
to
play
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Always
a
rogue
,
Harry
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
get
her
away
,
sir
,
"
said
nurse
;
<EOS>
"
you
know
there
is
much
to
be
done
before
"
    
"
I
understand
,
nurse
.
"
said
the
father
,
hastily
interrupting
her
in
dread
of
the
distinct
words
which
would
tell
of
the
changes
of
mortality
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
love
,
"
said
he
to
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
come
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
you
downstairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
coming
,
"
said
she
,
rising
;
"
perhaps
,
after
all
,
nurse
,
he
's
really
tired
,
and
would
be
glad
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
him
get
cold
,
though
,
 
he
feels
rather
chilly
,
"
continued
she
,
after
she
had
bent
down
,
and
kissed
the
pale
lips
.
  
<EOS>
Her
husband
put
his
arm
around
her
waist
,
and
they
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
Then
the
three
sisters
burst
into
unrestrained
wailings
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
startled
into
the
reality
of
life
and
death
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
in
the
midst
of
shrieks
and
moans
,
of
shivering
and
chattering
of
teeth
,
Sophy
's
eye
caught
the
calm
beauty
of
the
dead
;
so
calm
amidst
such
violence
,
and
she
hushed
her
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
said
she
to
her
sisters
,
"
nurse
wants
us
to
go
;
and
besides
,
we
ought
to
be
with
mamma
.
 
<EOS>
Papa
told
the
man
he
was
talking
to
,
when
I
went
for
him
,
to
wait
,
and
she
must
not
be
left
.
"
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
superintendent
had
taken
a
candle
,
and
was
examining
the
engravings
that
hung
round
the
dining
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
so
common
to
him
to
be
acquainted
with
crime
,
that
he
was
far
from
feeling
all
his
interest
absorbed
in
the
present
case
of
violence
,
although
he
could
not
help
having
much
anxiety
to
detect
the
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
busy
looking
at
the
only
oil
-
painting
in
the
room
(
a
youth
of
eighteen
or
so
,
in
a
fancy
dress
)
,
and
conjecturing
its
identity
with
the
young
man
so
mysteriously
dead
,
when
the
door
opened
,
and
Mr.
Carson
returned
.
 
<EOS>
Stern
as
he
had
looked
before
leaving
the
room
,
he
looked
far
sterner
now
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
was
hardened
into
deep
-
purposed
wrath
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
for
leaving
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
superintendent
bowed
.
 
<EOS>
They
sat
down
,
and
spoke
long
together
.
 
<EOS>
One
by
one
the
policemen
were
called
in
,
and
questioned
.
  
<EOS>
All
through
the
night
there
was
bustle
and
commotion
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Nobody
thought
of
going
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
strange
to
Sophy
to
hear
nurse
summoned
from
her
mother
's
side
to
supper
,
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
and
still
stranger
that
she
could
go
.
 
<EOS>
The
necessity
of
eating
and
drinking
seemed
out
of
place
in
the
house
of
death
.
  
<EOS>
When
night
was
passing
into
morning
,
the
dining
-
room
door
opened
,
and
two
persons
'
steps
were
heard
along
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
The
superintendent
was
leaving
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
stood
on
the
front
-
door
step
,
feeling
the
refreshment
of
the
caller
morning
air
,
and
seeing
the
starlight
fade
away
into
dawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
forget
,
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
policeman
bowed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Spare
no
money
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
purpose
for
which
I
now
value
wealth
is
to
have
the
murderer
arrested
,
and
brought
to
justice
.
 
<EOS>
My
hope
in
life
now
is
to
see
him
sentenced
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
Offer
any
rewards
.
 
<EOS>
Name
a
thousand
pounds
in
the
placards
.
 
<EOS>
Come
to
me
at
any
hour
,
night
or
day
,
if
that
be
required
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
ask
of
you
is
,
to
get
the
murderer
hanged
.
 
<EOS>
Next
week
,
if
possible
 
to
-
day
is
Friday
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
with
the
clues
you
already
possess
,
you
can
muster
up
evidence
sufficient
to
have
him
tried
next
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
may
easily
request
an
adjournment
of
his
trial
,
on
the
ground
of
the
shortness
of
the
notice
,
"
said
the
superintendent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oppose
it
,
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
see
that
the
first
lawyers
are
employed
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
know
no
rest
while
he
lives
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Everything
shall
be
done
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
arrange
with
the
coroner
.
 
<EOS>
Ten
o'clock
if
convenient
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
superintendent
took
leave
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
stood
on
the
step
,
dreading
to
shut
out
the
light
and
air
,
and
return
into
the
haunted
,
gloomy
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
son
!
<EOS>
my
son
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
shall
be
avenged
,
my
poor
murdered
boy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Ay
!
to
avenge
his
wrongs
the
murderer
had
singled
out
his
victim
,
and
with
one
fell
action
had
taken
away
the
life
that
God
had
given
.
<EOS>
To
avenge
his
child
's
death
,
the
old
man
lived
on
;
with
the
single
purpose
in
his
heart
of
vengeance
on
the
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
True
,
his
vengeance
was
sanctioned
by
law
,
but
was
it
the
less
revenge
?
  
<EOS>
Are
ye
worshippers
of
Christ
?
<EOS>
or
of
Alecto
?
  
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Orestes
,
you
would
have
made
a
very
tolerable
Christian
of
the
nineteenth
century
!

JEM

ARRESTED
ON
SUSPICION
,
 
<EOS>
"
Deeds
to
be
hid
which
were
not
hid
,
Which
,
all
confused
,
I
could
not
know
,
Whether
I
suffered

I
did

For
all
seemed
guilt

COLERIDGE
.
  
<EOS>
I
left
Mary
,
on
that
same
Thursday
night
which
left
its
burden
of
woe
at
Mr.
Carson
's
threshold
,
haunted
with
depressing
thoughts
.
<EOS>
All
through
the
night
she
tossed
restlessly
about
,
trying
to
get
quit
of
the
ideas
that
harassed
her
,
and
longing
for
the
light
when
she
could
rise
,
and
find
some
employment
.
 
<EOS>
But
just
as
dawn
began
to
appear
,
she
became
more
quiet
,
and
fell
into
a
sound
heavy
sleep
,
which
lasted
till
she
was
sure
it
was
late
in
the
morning
,
by
the
full
light
that
shone
in
.
  
<EOS>
She
dressed
hastily
,
and
heard
the
neighbouring
church
clock
strike
eight
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
far
too
late
to
do
as
she
had
planned
(
after
inquiring
how
Alice
was
,
to
return
and
tell
Margaret
)
,
and
she
accordingly
went
in
to
inform
the
latter
of
her
change
of
purpose
,
and
the
cause
of
it
;
but
on
entering
the
house
she
found
Job
sitting
alone
,
looking
sad
enough
.
 
<EOS>
She
told
him
what
she
came
for
.
  
<EOS>
"
Margaret
,
wench
!
<EOS>
why
,
she
's
been
gone
to
Wilson
's
these
two
hours
.
<EOS>
Ay
!
<EOS>
sure
,
you
did
say
last
night
you
would
go
;
but
she
could
na
rest
in
her
bed
,
so
was
off
betimes
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
could
do
nothing
but
feel
guilty
of
her
long
morning
nap
,
and
hasten
to
follow
Margaret
's
steps
;
for
late
as
it
was
,
she
felt
she
could
not
settle
well
to
her
work
,
unless
she
learnt
how
kind
good
Alice
Wilson
was
going
on
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
eating
her
crust
-
of
-
bread
breakfast
,
she
passed
rapidly
along
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
She
remembered
afterwards
the
little
groups
of
people
she
had
seen
,
eagerly
hearing
,
and
imparting
news
;
but
at
the
time
her
only
care
was
to
hasten
on
her
way
,
in
dread
of
a
reprimand
from
Miss
Simmonds
.
  
<EOS>
She
went
into
the
house
at
Jane
Wilson
's
,
her
heart
at
the
instant
giving
a
strange
knock
,
and
sending
the
rosy
flush
into
her
face
,
at
the
thought
that
Jem
might
possibly
be
inside
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
assure
you
,
she
had
not
thought
of
it
before
.
 
<EOS>
Impatient
and
loving
as
she
was
,
her
solicitude
about
Alice
on
that
hurried
morning
had
not
been
mingled
with
any
thought
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
Her
heart
need
not
have
leaped
,
her
colour
need
not
have
rushed
so
painfully
to
her
cheeks
,
for
he
was
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
round
table
,
with
a
cup
and
saucer
,
which
had
evidently
been
used
,
and
there
was
Jane
Wilson
sitting
on
the
other
side
,
crying
quietly
,
while
she
ate
her
breakfast
with
a
sort
of
unconscious
appetite
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
Mrs.
Davenport
washing
away
at
a
night
-
cap
or
so
,
which
,
by
their
simple
,
old
-
world
make
,
Mary
knew
at
a
glance
were
Alice
's
.
 
<EOS>
But
nothing
 
<EOS>
no
one
else
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
was
much
the
same
,
or
rather
better
of
the
two
,
they
told
her
:
at
any
rate
she
could
speak
,
though
it
was
sad
rambling
talk
.
 
<EOS>
Would
Mary
like
to
see
her
?
  
<EOS>
Of
course
she
would
.
 
<EOS>
Many
are
interested
by
seeing
their
friends
under
the
new
aspect
of
illness
;
and
among
the
poor
there
is
no
wholesome
fear
of
injury
or
excitement
to
restrain
this
wish
.
  
<EOS>
So
Mary
went
upstairs
,
accompanied
by
Mrs.
Davenport
,
wringing
the
suds
off
her
hands
,
and
speaking
in
a
loud
whisper
far
more
audible
than
her
usual
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mun
be
hastening
home
,
but
I
'll
come
again
to
-
night
,
time
enough
to
iron
her
cap
;
'
twould
be
a
sin
and
a
shame
if
we
let
her
go
dirty
<EOS>
now
she
's
ill
,
when
she
's
been
so
rare
and
clean
all
her
life
long
.
<EOS>
But
she
's
sadly
forsaken
,
poor
thing
!
 
<EOS>
She
'll
not
know
you
,
Mary
;
she
knows
none
of
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
room
upstairs
held
two
beds
,
one
superior
in
the
grandeur
of
four
posts
and
checked
curtains
to
the
other
,
which
had
been
occupied
by
the
twins
in
their
brief
lifetime
.
 
<EOS>
The
smaller
had
been
Alice
's
bed
since
she
had
lived
there
;
but
with
the
natural
reverence
to
one
"
stricken
of
God
and
afflicted
,
"
she
had
been
installed
,
since
her
paralytic
stroke
the
evening
before
,
in
the
larger
and
grander
bed
;
while
Jane
Wilson
had
taken
her
short
broken
rest
on
the
little
pallet
.
  
<EOS>
Margaret
came
forwards
to
meet
her
friend
,
whom
she
half
expected
,
and
whose
step
she
knew
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davenport
returned
to
her
washing
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
girls
did
not
speak
;
the
presence
of
Alice
awed
them
into
silence
.
 
<EOS>
There
she
lay
with
the
rosy
colour
,
absent
from
her
face
since
the
days
of
childhood
,
flushed
once
more
into
it
by
her
sickness
nigh
unto
death
.
 
<EOS>
She
lay
on
the
affected
side
,
and
with
her
other
arm
she
was
constantly
sawing
the
air
,
not
exactly
in
a
restless
manner
,
but
in
a
monotonous
,
incessant
way
,
very
trying
to
a
watcher
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
talking
away
,
too
,
almost
as
constantly
,
in
a
low
indistinct
tone
.
 
<EOS>
But
her
face
,
her
profiled
countenance
,
looked
calm
and
smiling
,
even
interested
by
the
ideas
that
were
passing
through
her
clouded
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Listen
!
"
<EOS>
said
Margaret
,
as
she
stooped
her
head
down
to
catch
the
muttered
words
more
distinctly
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
will
mother
say
?
 
<EOS>
The
bees
are
turning
homeward
for
th
'
last
time
,
and
we
've
a
terrible
long
bit
to
go
yet
.
 
<EOS>
See
!
<EOS>
here
's
a
linnet
's
nest
in
this
gorse
-
bush
.
 
<EOS>
Th
'
hen
bird
is
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
her
bright
eyes
,
she
wo
n't
stir
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
!
<EOS>
we
mun
hurry
home
.
 
<EOS>
Wo
n't
mother
be
pleased
with
the
bonny
lot
of
heather
we
've
got
!
 
<EOS>
Make
haste
,
Sally
,
maybe
we
shall
have
cockles
for
supper
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
th
'
cockleman
's
donkey
turn
up
<EOS>
our
way
fra
'
Arnside
.
"
  
<EOS>
Margaret
touched
Mary
's
hand
,
and
the
pressure
in
return
told
her
that
they
understood
each
other
;
that
they
knew
how
in
this
illness
to
the
old
,
world
-
weary
woman
,
God
had
sent
her
a
veiled
blessing
:
she
was
once
more
in
the
scenes
of
her
childhood
,
unchanged
and
bright
as
in
those
long
departed
days
;
once
more
with
the
sister
of
her
youth
,
the
playmate
of
fifty
years
ago
,
who
had
for
nearly
as
many
years
slept
in
a
grassy
grave
in
the
little
churchyard
beyond
Burton
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
's
face
changed
;
she
looked
sorrowful
,
almost
penitent
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
Sally
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
we
'd
told
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
thinks
we
were
in
church
all
morning
,
and
we
've
gone
on
deceiving
her
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
'd
told
her
at
first
how
it
was
 
how
sweet
th
'
hawthorn
smelt
through
the
open
church
door
,
and
how
we
were
on
th
'
last
bench
in
the
aisle
,
and
how
it
were
the
first
butterfly
we
'd
seen
this
spring
,
and
how
it
flew
into
th
'
very
church
itself
;
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
mother
is
so
gentle
<EOS>
,
I
wish
we
'd
told
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
to
her
next
time
she
comes
in
sight
,
and
say
,
"
Mother
,
we
were
naughty
last
Sabbath
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
stopped
,
and
a
few
tears
came
stealing
down
the
old
withered
cheek
,
at
the
thought
of
the
temptation
and
deceit
of
her
childhood
.
<EOS>
Surely
many
sins
could
not
have
darkened
that
innocent
child
-
like
spirit
since
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
found
a
red
-
spotted
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
and
put
it
into
the
hand
which
sought
about
for
something
to
wipe
away
the
trickling
tears
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
it
with
a
gentle
murmur
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
mother
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
pulled
Margaret
away
from
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
she
's
happy
,
Margaret
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
that
I
do
,
bless
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
feels
no
pain
,
and
knows
nought
of
her
present
state
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
I
could
see
,
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
I
try
and
be
patient
with
her
afore
me
,
but
I
'd
give
aught
I
have
to
see
her
,
and
see
what
she
wants
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
useless
!
 
<EOS>
I
mean
to
stay
here
as
long
as
Jane
Wilson
is
alone
;
and
I
would
fain
be
here
all
to
-
night
,
but
"
    
"
I
'll
come
,
"
said
Mary
decidedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Davenport
said
she
'd
come
again
,
but
she
's
hardworked
all
day
"
    
"
I
'll
come
,
"
repeated
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
!
"
said
Margaret
,
"
and
I
'll
be
here
till
you
come
.
 
<EOS>
Maybe
,
Jem
and
you
could
take
th
'
night
between
you
,
and
Jane
Wilson
might
get
a
bit
of
sound
sleep
in
his
bed
;
for
she
were
up
and
down
the
better
part
of
last
night
,
and
just
when
she
were
in
a
sound
sleep
this
morning
,
between
two
and
three
,
Jem
came
home
,
and
th
'
sound
o
'
his
voice
roused
her
in
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
had
he
been
till
that
time
<EOS>
o
'
night
?
"
asked
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
!
<EOS>
it
were
none
of
my
business
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
never
saw
him
till
he
came
in
here
to
see
Alice
.
 
<EOS>
He
were
in
again
this
morning
,
and
seemed
sadly
downcast
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
'll
,
maybe
,
manage
to
comfort
him
to
-
night
,
Mary
,
"
said
Margaret
,
smiling
,
while
a
ray
of
hope
glimmered
in
Mary
's
heart
,
and
she
almost
felt
glad
,
for
an
instant
,
of
the
occasion
which
would
at
last
bring
them
together
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
happy
night
!
<EOS>
when
would
it
come
?
 
<EOS>
Many
hours
had
yet
to
pass
.
  
<EOS>
Then
she
saw
Alice
,
and
repented
,
with
a
bitter
self
-
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
could
not
help
having
gladness
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
,
blame
herself
as
she
would
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
tried
not
to
think
,
as
she
hurried
along
to
Miss
Simmonds
'
,
with
a
dancing
step
of
lightness
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
late
 
that
she
knew
she
should
be
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Simmonds
was
vexed
and
cross
.
 
<EOS>
That
also
she
had
anticipated
,
and
had
intended
to
smooth
her
raven
down
by
extraordinary
diligence
and
attention
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
something
about
the
girls
she
did
not
understand
 
had
not
anticipated
.
 
<EOS>
They
stopped
talking
when
she
came
in
;
or
rather
,
I
should
say
,
stopped
listening
,
for
Sally
Leadbitter
<EOS>
was
the
talker
to
whom
they
were
hearkening
with
deepest
attention
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
they
eyed
Mary
,
as
if
she
had
acquired
some
new
interest
to
them
since
the
day
before
.
 
<EOS>
Then
they
began
to
whisper
;
and
,
absorbed
as
Mary
had
been
in
her
own
thoughts
,
she
could
not
help
becoming
aware
that
it
was
of
her
they
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
Sally
Leadbitter
asked
Mary
if
she
had
heard
the
news
?
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
 
<EOS>
What
news
?
<EOS>
"
answered
she
.
  
<EOS>
The
girls
looked
at
each
other
with
gloomy
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
Sally
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
not
heard
that
young
Mr.
Carson
was
murdered
last
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
's
lips
could
not
utter
a
negative
,
but
no
one
who
looked
at
her
pale
and
terror
-
stricken
face
could
have
doubted
that
she
had
not
heard
before
of
the
fearful
occurrence
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
it
is
terrible
,
that
sudden
information
,
that
one
you
have
known
has
met
with
a
bloody
death
!
 
<EOS>
You
seem
to
shrink
from
the
world
where
such
deeds
can
be
committed
,
and
to
grow
sick
with
the
idea
of
the
violent
and
wicked
men
of
earth
.
 
<EOS>
Much
as
Mary
had
learned
to
dread
him
lately
,
now
he
was
dead
(
and
dead
in
such
a
manner
)
<EOS>
her
feeling
was
that
of
oppressive
sorrow
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
room
went
round
and
round
,
and
she
felt
as
though
she
should
faint
;
but
Miss
Simmonds
came
in
,
bringing
a
waft
of
fresher
air
as
she
opened
the
door
,
to
refresh
the
body
,
and
the
certainty
of
a
scolding
for
inattention
to
brace
the
sinking
mind
.
 
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
was
full
of
the
morning
's
news
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
heard
any
more
of
this
horrid
affair
,
Miss
Barton
?
"
<EOS>
asked
she
,
as
she
settled
to
her
work
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
tried
to
speak
;
at
first
she
could
not
,
and
when
she
succeeded
in
uttering
a
sentence
,
it
seemed
as
though
it
were
not
her
own
voice
that
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
ma'am
,
I
never
heard
of
it
till
this
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
!
<EOS>
that
's
strange
,
for
every
one
is
up
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
the
murderer
will
be
found
out
,
that
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
handsome
young
man
to
be
killed
as
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
the
wretch
that
did
it
may
be
hanged
as
high
as
Haman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
One
of
the
girls
reminded
them
that
the
assizes
came
on
next
week
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
replied
Miss
Simmonds
,
"
and
the
milkman
told
me
they
will
catch
the
wretch
,
and
have
him
tried
and
hung
in
less
than
a
week
.
<EOS>
Serve
him
right
,
whoever
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
handsome
young
man
as
he
was
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
each
began
to
communicate
to
Miss
Simmonds
the
various
reports
they
had
heard
.
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
she
burst
out
   
"
Miss
Barton
!
<EOS>
as
I
live
,
dropping
tears
on
that
new
silk
gown
of
Mrs.
Hawkes
'
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
they
will
stain
,
and
make
it
shabby
for
ever
?
 
<EOS>
Crying
like
a
baby
,
because
a
handsome
young
man
meets
with
an
untimely
end
.
 
<EOS>
For
shame
of
yourself
,
miss
!
 
<EOS>
Mind
your
character
and
your
work
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
Or
if
you
must
cry
"
(
seeing
her
scolding
rather
increased
the
flow
of
Mary
's
tears
,
than
otherwise
)
<EOS>
,
"
take
this
print
to
cry
over
.
 
<EOS>
That
wo
n't
be
marked
like
this
beautiful
silk
,
"
rubbing
it
,
as
if
she
loved
it
,
with
a
clean
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
in
order
to
soften
the
edges
of
the
hard
round
drops
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
took
the
print
,
and
,
naturally
enough
,
having
had
leave
given
her
to
cry
over
it
,
rather
checked
the
inclination
to
weep
.
  
<EOS>
Everybody
was
full
of
the
one
subject
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
sent
out
to
match
silk
,
came
back
with
the
account
gathered
at
the
shop
,
of
the
coroner
's
inquest
then
sitting
;
the
ladies
who
called
to
speak
about
gowns
first
began
about
the
murder
,
and
mingled
details
of
that
,
with
directions
for
their
dresses
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
felt
as
though
the
haunting
horror
were
a
nightmare
,
a
fearful
dream
,
from
which
awakening
would
relieve
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
picture
of
the
murdered
body
,
far
more
ghastly
than
the
reality
,
seemed
to
swim
in
the
air
before
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Sally
Leadbitter
looked
and
spoke
of
her
,
almost
accusingly
,
and
made
no
secret
now
of
Mary
's
conduct
,
more
blamable
to
her
fellow
-
workwomen
for
its
latter
changeableness
,
than
for
its
former
giddy
flirting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
young
gentleman
,
"
said
one
,
as
Sally
recounted
Mary
's
last
interview
with
Mr.
Carson
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
shame
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
another
,
looking
indignantly
at
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
I
call
regular
jilting
,
"
said
a
third
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
he
lying
cold
and
bloody
in
his
coffin
now
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
was
more
thankful
than
she
could
express
,
when
Miss
Simmonds
returned
,
to
put
a
stop
to
Sally
's
communications
,
and
to
check
the
remarks
of
the
girls
.
  
<EOS>
She
longed
for
the
peace
of
Alice
's
sick
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
No
more
thinking
with
infinite
delight
of
her
anticipated
meeting
with
Jem
<EOS>
;
she
felt
too
much
shocked
for
that
now
;
but
longing
for
peace
and
kindness
,
for
the
images
of
rest
and
beauty
,
and
sinless
times
long
ago
,
which
the
poor
old
woman
's
rambling
presented
,
she
wished
to
be
as
near
death
as
Alice
;
and
to
have
struggled
through
this
world
,
whose
sufferings
she
had
early
learnt
,
and
whose
crimes
now
seemed
pressing
close
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
Old
texts
from
the
Bible
,
that
her
mother
used
to
read
(
or
rather
spell
out
)
aloud
in
the
days
of
childhood
,
came
up
to
her
memory
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
,
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
God
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes
,
"
etc
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
was
to
that
world
Alice
was
hastening
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
that
she
were
Alice
!
  
<EOS>
I
must
return
to
the
Wilsons
'
house
,
which
was
far
from
being
the
abode
of
peace
that
Mary
was
picturing
it
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
You
remember
the
reward
Mr.
Carson
offered
for
the
apprehension
of
the
murderer
of
his
son
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
itself
a
temptation
,
and
to
aid
its
efficacy
<EOS>
came
the
natural
sympathy
for
the
aged
parents
mourning
for
their
child
,
for
the
young
man
cut
off
in
the
flower
of
his
days
;
and
besides
this
,
there
is
always
a
pleasure
in
unravelling
a
mystery
,
in
catching
at
the
gossamer
clue
which
will
guide
to
certainty
.
<EOS>
This
feeling
,
I
am
sure
,
gives
much
impetus
to
the
police
.
 
<EOS>
Their
senses
are
ever
and
always
on
the
qui
-
vive
,
and
they
enjoy
the
collecting
and
collating
evidence
,
and
the
life
of
adventure
they
experience
:
a
continual
unwinding
of
Jack
Sheppard
romances
,
always
interesting
to
the
vulgar
and
uneducated
mind
,
to
which
the
outward
signs
and
tokens
of
crime
are
ever
exciting
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
lack
of
clue
or
evidence
at
the
coroner
's
inquest
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
The
shot
,
the
finding
of
the
body
,
the
subsequent
discovery
of
the
gun
,
were
rapidly
deposed
to
;
and
then
the
policeman
who
had
interrupted
the
quarrel
between
Jem
Wilson
and
the
murdered
young
man
was
brought
forward
,
and
gave
his
evidence
,
clear
,
simple
,
and
straightforward
.
 
<EOS>
The
coroner
had
no
hesitation
,
the
jury
had
none
,
but
the
verdict
was
cautiously
worded
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wilful
murder
against
some
person
unknown

This
very
cautiousness
,
when
he
deemed
the
thing
so
sure
as
to
require
no
caution
,
irritated
Mr.
Carson
.
 
<EOS>
It
did
not
soothe
him
that
the
superintendent
called
the
verdict
a
mere
form
,
 
exhibited
a
warrant
empowering
him
to
seize
the
body
of
Jem
Wilson
committed
on
suspicion
,
 
declared
his
intention
of
employing
a
well
-
known
officer
in
the
Detective
Service
to
ascertain
the
ownership
of
the
gun
,
and
to
collect
other
evidence
,
especially
as
regarded
the
young
woman
,
about
whom
the
policeman
deposed
that
the
quarrel
had
taken
place
;
Mr.
Carson
was
still
excited
and
irritable
;
restless
in
body
and
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
every
preparation
for
the
accusation
of
Jem
the
following
morning
before
the
magistrates
:
he
engaged
attorneys
skilled
in
criminal
practice
to
watch
the
case
and
prepare
briefs
;
he
wrote
to
celebrated
barristers
coming
the
Northern
Circuit
,
to
bespeak
their
services
.
 
<EOS>
A
speedy
conviction
,
a
speedy
execution
,
seemed
to
be
the
only
things
that
would
satisfy
his
craving
thirst
for
blood
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
fain
been
policeman
,
magistrate
,
accusing
speaker
,
all
;
but
most
of
all
,
the
judge
,
rising
with
full
sentence
of
death
on
his
lips
.
  
<EOS>
That
afternoon
,
as
Jane
Wilson
had
begun
to
feel
the
effect
of
a
night
's
disturbed
rest
,
evinced
in
frequent
droppings
off
to
sleep
,
while
she
sat
by
her
sister
-
in
-
law
's
bedside
,
lulled
by
the
incessant
crooning
of
the
invalid
's
feeble
voice
,
she
was
startled
by
a
man
speaking
in
the
house
-
place
below
,
who
,
wearied
of
knocking
at
the
door
,
without
obtaining
any
answer
,
had
entered
and
was
calling
lustily
for
   
<EOS>
"
Missis
!
missis
!
"
  
<EOS>
When
Mrs.
Wilson
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
intruder
through
the
stair
-
rails
,
she
at
once
saw
he
was
a
stranger
,
a
working
-
man
,
it
might
be
a
fellow
-
labourer
with
her
son
,
for
his
dress
was
grimy
enough
for
the
supposition
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
a
gun
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
make
bold
to
ask
if
this
gun
belongs
to
your
son
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
first
looked
at
the
man
,
and
then
,
weary
and
half
asleep
,
not
seeing
any
reason
for
refusing
to
answer
the
inquiry
,
she
moved
forward
to
examine
it
,
talking
while
she
looked
for
certain
old
-
fashioned
ornaments
on
the
stock
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
looks
like
his
;
ay
,
it
is
his
,
sure
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
speak
to
it
anywhere
by
these
marks
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
it
were
his
grandfather
's
as
were
gamekeeper
to
some
one
up
in
th
'
north
;
and
they
do
n't
make
guns
so
smart
nowadays
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
how
comed
you
by
it
?
 
<EOS>
He
sets
great
store
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
Is
he
bound
for
th
'
shooting
-
gallery
?
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
,
for
sure
,
now
his
aunt
is
so
ill
,
and
me
left
all
alone
"
;
and
the
immediate
cause
of
her
anxiety
being
thus
recalled
to
her
mind
,
she
entered
on
a
long
story
of
Alice
's
illness
,
interspersed
with
recollections
of
her
husband
's
and
her
children
's
deaths
.
  
<EOS>
The
disguised
policeman
listened
for
a
minute
or
two
,
to
glean
any
further
information
he
could
;
and
then
,
saying
he
was
in
a
hurry
,
he
turned
to
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
She
followed
him
to
the
door
,
still
telling
him
her
troubles
,
and
was
never
struck
,
until
it
was
too
late
to
ask
the
reason
,
with
the
unaccountableness
of
his
conduct
,
in
carrying
the
gun
away
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
as
she
heavily
climbed
the
stairs
,
she
put
away
the
wonder
and
the
thought
about
his
conduct
,
by
determining
to
believe
he
was
some
workman
with
whom
her
son
had
made
some
arrangement
about
shooting
at
the
gallery
;
or
mending
the
old
weapon
;
or
something
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
enough
to
fret
her
,
without
moidering
herself
about
old
guns
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
had
given
it
to
him
to
bring
it
to
her
;
so
it
was
safe
enough
;
or
,
if
it
was
not
,
why
she
should
be
glad
never
to
set
eyes
on
it
again
,
for
she
could
not
abide
firearms
,
they
were
so
apt
to
shoot
people
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
comforting
herself
for
the
want
of
thought
in
not
making
further
inquiry
,
she
fell
off
into
another
dose
,
feverish
,
dream
-
haunted
,
and
unrefreshing
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
policeman
walked
off
with
his
prize
,
with
an
odd
mixture
of
feelings
;
a
little
contempt
,
a
little
disappointment
,
and
a
good
deal
of
pity
.
 
<EOS>
The
contempt
and
the
disappointment
were
caused
by
the
widow
's
easy
admission
of
the
gun
being
her
son
's
property
,
and
her
manner
of
identifying
it
by
the
ornaments
.
 
<EOS>
He
liked
an
attempt
to
baffle
him
;
he
was
accustomed
to
it
;
it
gave
some
exercise
to
his
wits
and
his
shrewdness
.
 
<EOS>
There
would
be
no
fun
in
fox
-
hunting
,
if
Reynard
yielded
himself
up
without
any
effort
to
escape
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
again
,
his
mother
's
milk
was
yet
in
him
,
policeman
,
officer
of
the
Detective
Service
though
he
was
;
and
he
felt
sorry
for
the
old
woman
,
whose
"
softness
"
had
given
such
material
assistance
in
identifying
her
son
as
the
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
he
conveyed
the
gun
,
and
the
intelligence
he
had
gained
,
to
the
superintendent
;
and
the
result
was
,
that
,
in
a
short
time
afterwards
,
three
policemen
went
to
the
works
at
which
Jem
was
foreman
,
and
announced
their
errand
to
the
astonished
overseer
,
who
directed
them
to
the
part
of
the
foundry
where
Jem
was
then
superintending
a
casting
.
  
<EOS>
Dark
,
black
were
the
walls
,
the
ground
,
the
faces
around
them
,
as
they
crossed
the
yard
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
furnace
-
house
,
a
deep
and
lurid
red
glared
over
all
;
the
furnace
roared
with
mighty
flame
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
,
like
demons
,
in
their
fire
-
and
-
soot
colouring
,
stood
swart
around
,
awaiting
the
moment
when
the
tons
of
solid
iron
should
have
melted
down
into
fiery
liquid
,
fit
to
be
poured
,
with
still
,
heavy
sound
,
into
the
delicate
moulding
of
fine
black
sand
,
prepared
to
receive
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
heat
was
intense
,
and
the
red
glare
grew
every
instant
more
fierce
;
the
policemen
stood
awed
with
the
novel
sight
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
black
figures
,
holding
strange
-
shaped
bucket
-
shovels
,
came
athwart
the
deep
-
red
furnace
light
,
and
clear
and
brilliant
flowed
forth
the
iron
into
the
appropriate
mould
.
 
<EOS>
The
buzz
of
voices
rose
again
;
there
was
time
to
speak
,
and
gasp
,
and
wipe
the
brows
;
and
then
one
by
one
,
the
men
dispersed
to
some
other
branch
of
their
employment
.
  
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
B72
pointed
out
Jem
as
the
man
he
had
seen
engaged
in
a
scuffle
with
Mr.
Carson
,
and
then
the
other
two
stepped
forward
and
arrested
him
,
stating
of
what
he
was
accused
,
and
the
grounds
of
the
accusation
.
 
<EOS>
He
offered
no
resistance
,
though
he
seemed
surprised
;
but
calling
a
fellow
-
workman
to
him
,
he
briefly
requested
him
to
tell
his
mother
he
had
got
into
trouble
,
and
could
not
return
home
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
wish
her
to
hear
more
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
So
Mrs.
Wilson
's
sleep
was
next
interrupted
in
almost
an
exactly
similar
way
to
the
last
,
like
a
recurring
nightmare
.
  
<EOS>
"
Missis
!
missis
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
some
one
called
out
from
below
.
  
<EOS>
Again
it
was
a
workman
,
but
this
time
a
blacker
-
looking
one
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
don
ye
want
?
"
said
she
peevishly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
nothing
but
"
 
s
tammered
the
man
,
a
kind
-
hearted
matter
-
of
-
fact
person
,
with
no
invention
,
but
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
speak
out
,
ca
n't
ye
,
and
ha
'
done
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jem
's
in
trouble
,
"
said
he
,
repeating
Jem
's
very
words
,
as
he
could
think
of
no
others
.
  
<EOS>
"
Trouble
?
"
said
the
mother
,
in
a
high
-
pitched
voice
of
distress
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Trouble
!
 
<EOS>
God
help
me
,
trouble
will
never
end
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
What
d'ye
mean
by
trouble
?
 
<EOS>
Speak
out
,
man
,
ca
n't
ye
?
 
<EOS>
Is
he
ill
?
 
<EOS>
My
boy
!
<EOS>
tell
me
,
is
he
ill
?
"
<EOS>
in
a
hurried
voice
of
terror
.
  
<EOS>
"
Na
,
na
,
that
's
not
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
All
he
bade
<EOS>
me
say
was
,
"
<EOS>
Tell
mother
I
'm
in
trouble
,
and
ca
n't
come
home
tonight
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
come
home
to
-
night
!
 
<EOS>
And
what
am
I
to
do
with
Alice
?
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
go
on
,
wearing
my
life
out
wi
'
watching
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
come
and
help
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
he
ca
n't
,
"
said
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
,
and
he
is
well
,
you
say
?
 
<EOS>
Stuff
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
just
that
he
's
getten
like
other
young
men
,
and
wants
to
go
a
-
larking
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
give
it
him
when
he
comes
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
turned
to
go
;
he
durst
not
trust
himself
to
speak
in
Jem
's
justification
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
would
not
let
him
off
.
  
<EOS>
She
stood
between
him
and
the
door
,
as
she
said
   
"
Yo
shall
not
go
till
yo've
told
me
what
he
's
after

<EOS>
I
can
see
plain
enough
you
know

and
I
'll
know
too

before
I
've
done

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
know
soon
enough

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
know
now

I
tell
ye

<EOS>
What
's
up
that
he
ca
n't
come
home
and
help
me
nurse
?
 
<EOS>
Me
,
as
never
got
<EOS>
a
wink
o
'
sleep
last
night
wi
'
watching
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
you
will
have
it
out
,
"
said
the
poor
badgered
man
,
"
the
police
have
got
hold
on
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
my
Jem
!
"
said
the
enraged
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
downright
liar
,
and
that
's
what
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
My
Jem
,
as
never
did
harm
to
any
one
in
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
liar
<EOS>
,
that
's
what
you
are

"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
done
harm
enough
now
,
"
said
the
man
,
angry
in
his
turn
,
"
for
there
's
good
evidence
he
murdered
young
Carson
,
as
was
shot
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
staggered
forward
to
strike
the
man
for
telling
the
terrible
truth
;
but
the
weakness
of
old
age
,
of
motherly
agony
,
overcame
her
,
and
she
sank
down
on
a
chair
,
and
covered
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
leave
her
.
  
<EOS>
When
next
she
spoke
,
it
was
in
an
imploring
,
feeble
,
child
-
like
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
master
,
say
you
're
only
joking
.
 
<EOS>
I
ax
your
pardon
if
I
have
vexed
ye
,
but
please
say
you
're
only
joking
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
what
Jem
is
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
humbly
,
anxiously
up
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
were
only
joking
,
missis
;
but
it
's
true
as
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
They
've
taken
him
up
on
charge
of
murder
.
 
<EOS>
It
were
his
gun
as
were
found
near
th
'
place
;
and
one
o
'
<EOS>
the
police
heard
him
quarrelling
with
Mr.
Carson
a
few
days
back
,
about
a
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
About
a
girl
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
broke
in
the
mother
,
once
more
indignant
,
though
too
feeble
to
show
it
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
Jem
was
as
steady
as
"
 
s
he
hesitated
for
a
comparison
wherewith
to
finish
,
and
then
repeated
,
"
as
steady
as
Lucifer
,
and
he
were
an
angel

you
know

<EOS>
My
Jem
was
not
one
to
quarrel
about
a
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
but
it
was
that
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
They
'd
got
her
name
quite
pat

<EOS>
The
man
had
heard
all
they
said

Mary

her

whoever

Mary
Barton

<EOS>
the
dirty
hussy

<EOS>
to
bring
my
Jem
into
trouble
of
this
kind

I
'll
give
it
her
<EOS>
well

I
see
her

that
I
will

<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
my
poor
Jem

<EOS>
"
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
about
the
gun
?
<EOS>
What
did
ye
say
about
that

<EOS>
"
His
gun
were
found
on
th

spot

the
murder
were
done

<EOS>
"
That

a

one

A

got
the
gun
now

safe

sound

shook
his

Yes

A

<EOS>
"
Did

chap

"
asked
the
man
,
who
was
really
anxious
for
Jem
's
exculpation
,
and
caught
a
gleam
of
hope
from
her
last
speech

No
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
as
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
were
put
on
as
a
workman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
maybe
only
one
of
them
policemen
,
disguised
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
;
they
'd
never
go
for
to
do
that
,
and
trick
me
into
telling
on
my
own
son
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
like
seething
a
kid
in
its
mother
's
milk
;
and
that
th
'
Bible
forbids
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
replied
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
he
went
away
,
feeling
unable
to
comfort
,
yet
distressed
at
the
sight
of
sorrow
;
she
would
fain
have
detained
him
,
but
go
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
was
alone
.
  
<EOS>
She
never
for
an
instant
believed
Jem
guilty
:
she
would
have
doubted
if
the
sun
were
fire
,
first
:
but
sorrow
,
desolation
,
and
at
times
anger
,
took
possession
of
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
She
told
the
unconscious
Alice
,
hoping
to
rouse
her
to
sympathy
;
and
then
was
disappointed
,
because
,
still
smiling
and
calm
,
she
murmured
of
her
mother
,
and
the
happy
days
of
infancy
.

MARY
'S
DREAM
 
AND
THE
AWAKENING
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
saw
where
stark
and
cold
<EOS>
he
lay
,
Beneath
the
gallows
-
tree
,
And
every
one
did
point
and
say
,
"
'
<EOS>
Twas
there
he
died
for
thee
!
"
     
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
weeping
heart
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
bleeding
heart
!
<EOS>
What
boots
thy
pity
now
?
<EOS>
Bid
from
his
eyes
that
shade
depart
,
That
death
-
damp
from
his
brow
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
THE
BIRTLE
TRAGEDY
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
there
was
no
more
peace
in
the
house
of
sickness
except
to
Alice
,
the
dying
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mary
knew
nothing
of
the
afternoon
's
occurrences
;
and
gladly
did
she
breathe
in
the
fresh
air
,
as
she
left
Miss
Simmonds
'
house
,
to
hasten
to
the
Wilsons
'
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
change
,
from
the
indoor
to
the
outdoor
atmosphere
,
seemed
to
alter
the
current
of
her
thoughts
.
<EOS>
She
thought
less
of
the
dreadful
subject
which
had
so
haunted
her
all
day
;
she
cared
less
for
the
upbraiding
speeches
of
her
fellow
-
workwomen
;
the
old
association
of
comfort
and
sympathy
received
from
Alice
gave
her
the
idea
that
,
even
now
,
her
bodily
presence
would
soothe
and
compose
those
who
were
in
trouble
,
changed
,
unconscious
,
and
absent
though
her
spirit
might
be
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
again
,
she
reproached
herself
a
little
for
the
feeling
of
pleasure
she
experienced
,
in
thinking
that
he
whom
she
dreaded
could
never
more
beset
her
path
;
in
the
security
with
which
she
could
pass
each
street
corner
 
each
shop
,
where
he
used
to
lie
in
ambush
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
beating
heart
!
<EOS>
was
there
no
other
little
thought
of
joy
lurking
within
,
to
gladden
the
very
air
without
!
 
<EOS>
Was
she
not
going
to
meet
,
to
see
,
to
hear
Jem
;
and
could
they
fail
at
last
to
understand
each
other
's
loving
hearts
!
  
<EOS>
She
softly
lifted
the
latch
,
with
the
privilege
of
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
HE
was
not
there
,
but
his
mother
was
standing
by
the
fire
,
stirring
some
little
mess
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
!
<EOS>
he
would
come
soon
:
and
with
an
unmixed
desire
to
do
her
graceful
duty
to
all
belonging
to
him
,
she
stepped
lightly
forwards
,
unheard
by
the
old
lady
,
who
was
partly
occupied
by
the
simmering
,
bubbling
sound
of
her
bit
of
cookery
;
but
more
with
her
own
sad
thoughts
,
and
wailing
,
half
-
uttered
murmurings
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
took
off
bonnet
and
shawl
with
speed
,
and
advancing
,
made
Mrs.
Wilson
conscious
of
her
presence
,
by
saying
   
"
Let
me
do
that
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
you
mun
be
tired
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilson
slowly
turned
round
,
and
her
eyes
gleamed
like
those
of
a
pent
-
up
wild
beast
,
as
she
recognised
her
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
is
it
thee
that
dares
set
foot
in
this
house
,
after
what
has
come
to
pass
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
enough
to
have
robbed
me
of
my
boy
with
thy
arts
and
thy
profligacy
,
but
thou
must
come
here
to
crow
over
me
 
me
 
<EOS>
his
mother
?
 
<EOS>
Dost
thou
know
where
he
is
,
thou
bad
hussy
,
with
thy
great
blue
eyes
and
yellow
hair
,
to
lead
men
on
to
ruin
?
<EOS>
Out
upon
thee
with
thy
angel
's
face
,
thou
whited
sepulchre
!
 
<EOS>
Dost
thou
know
where
Jem
is
,
all
through
thee
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
<EOS>
quivered
out
poor
Mary
,
scarcely
conscious
that
she
spoke
,
so
daunted
,
so
terrified
was
she
by
the
indignant
mother
's
greeting
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
lying
in
th
'
New
Bailey
,
"
slowly
and
distinctly
spoke
the
mother
,
watching
the
effect
of
her
words
,
as
if
believing
in
their
infinite
power
to
pain
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
he
lies
,
waiting
to
take
his
trial
for
murdering
young
Mr.
Carson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
answer
;
but
such
a
blanched
face
,
such
wild
,
distended
eyes
,
such
trembling
limbs
,
instinctively
seeking
support
!
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
know
Mr.
Carson
as
now
lies
dead
?
"
continued
the
merciless
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Folk
say
you
did
,
and
knew
him
but
too
well
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
for
the
sake
of
such
as
you
,
my
precious
child
shot
yon
chap
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
he
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
hang
him
,
but
his
mother
will
speak
to
his
innocence
with
her
last
dying
breath
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
stopped
more
from
exhaustion
than
want
of
words
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
spoke
,
but
in
so
changed
and
choked
a
voice
that
the
old
woman
almost
started
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
some
third
person
must
be
in
the
room
,
the
voice
was
so
hoarse
and
strange
.
  
<EOS>
"
Please
say
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
quite
understand
you
.
 
<EOS>
What
has
Jem
done
?
 
<EOS>
Please
to
tell
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
said
he
had
done
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
and
I
'll
swear
,
that
he
never
did
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
who
heard
'em
quarrel
,
or
if
it
is
his
gun
as
were
found
near
the
body
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
my
own
Jem
as
would
go
for
to
kill
any
man
,
choose
how
a
girl
had
jilted
him
.
 
<EOS>
My
own
good
Jem
,
as
was
a
blessing
sent
upon
the
house
where
he
was
born
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Tears
came
into
the
mother
's
burning
eyes
as
her
heart
recurred
to
the
days
when
she
had
rocked
the
cradle
of
her
"
first
-
born
"
;
and
then
,
rapidly
passing
over
events
,
till
the
full
consciousness
of
his
present
situation
came
upon
her
,
and
perhaps
annoyed
at
having
shown
any
softness
of
character
in
the
presence
of
the
Delilah
who
had
lured
him
to
his
danger
,
she
spoke
again
,
and
in
a
sharp
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
him
,
and
told
him
to
leave
off
thinking
on
thee
;
but
he
would
n't
be
led
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
Thee
!
<EOS>
wench
!
<EOS>
thou
wert
not
good
enough
to
wipe
the
dust
off
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
A
vile
,
flirting
quean
as
thou
art
.
<EOS>
It
's
well
<EOS>
thy
mother
does
not
know
(
poor
body
)
<EOS>
what
a
good-
for
-
nothing
thou
art
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mother
!
<EOS>
O
mother
!
"
said
Mary
,
as
if
appealing
to
the
merciful
dead
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
was
not
good
enough
for
him
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
I
was
not
,
"
added
she
,
in
a
voice
of
touching
humility
.
  
<EOS>
For
through
her
heart
went
tolling
the
ominous
,
prophetic
words
he
had
used
when
he
had
last
spoken
to
her
   
"
Mary
!
<EOS>
you
'll
maybe
hear
of
me
as
a
drunkard
,
and
maybe
as
a
thief
,
and
maybe
as
a
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
!
<EOS>
when
all
are
speaking
ill
of
me
,
yo
will
have
no
right
to
blame
me
,
for
it
's
your
cruelty
that
will
have
made
me
what
I
feel
I
shall
become
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
she
did
not
blame
him
,
though
she
doubted
not
his
guilt
;
she
felt
how
madly
she
might
act
if
once
jealous
of
him
,
and
<EOS>
how
much
cause
had
she
not
given
him
for
jealousy
,
miserable
guilty
wretch
that
she
was
!
 
<EOS>
Speak
on
,
desolate
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Abuse
her
as
you
will
.
<EOS>
Her
broken
spirit
feels
to
have
merited
all
.
  
<EOS>
But
her
last
humble
,
self
-
abased
words
had
touched
Mrs.
Wilson
's
heart
,
sore
as
it
was
;
and
she
looked
at
the
snow
-
pale
girl
with
those
piteous
eyes
,
so
hopeless
of
comfort
,
and
she
relented
in
spite
of
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
seest
what
comes
of
light
conduct
,
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
thy
doing
that
suspicion
has
lighted
on
him
,
who
is
as
innocent
as
the
babe
unborn
.
<EOS>
Thou'lt
have
much
to
answer
for
if
he
's
hung
.
 
<EOS>
Thou'lt
have
my
death
too
at
thy
door
!
"
  
<EOS>
Harsh
as
these
words
seem
,
she
spoke
them
in
a
milder
tone
of
voice
than
she
had
yet
used
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
idea
of
Jem
on
the
gallows
,
Jem
dead
,
took
possession
of
Mary
,
and
she
covered
her
eyes
with
her
wan
hands
,
as
if
indeed
to
shut
out
the
fearful
sight
.
  
<EOS>
She
murmured
some
words
,
which
,
though
spoken
low
,
as
if
choked
up
from
the
depths
of
agony
,
Jane
Wilson
caught
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
heart
is
breaking
,
"
said
she
feebly
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
heart
is
breaking
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nonsense
!
"
said
Mrs.
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
in
that
silly
way
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
has
a
better
right
to
break
than
yours
,
and
yet
I
hold
up
<EOS>
,
you
see
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
oh
dear
!
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
a
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
,
as
the
reality
of
the
danger
in
which
her
son
was
placed
pressed
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
saying
?
 
<EOS>
How
could
I
hold
up
if
thou
wert
gone
,
Jem
?
 
<EOS>
Though
I
'm
as
sure
as
I
stand
here
of
thy
innocence
,
if
they
hang
thee
,
my
lad
,
I
will
lie
down
and
die
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
wept
aloud
with
bitter
consciousness
of
the
fearful
chance
awaiting
her
child
.
 
<EOS>
She
cried
more
passionately
still
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
roused
herself
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
let
me
stay
with
you
,
at
any
rate
,
till
we
know
the
end
.
<EOS>
Dearest
Mrs.
Wilson
,
may
n't
I
stay
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
more
obstinately
and
upbraidingly
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilson
refused
,
the
more
Mary
pleaded
,
with
ever
the
same
soft
entreating
cry
,
"
Let
me
stay
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Her
stunned
soul
seem
to
bound
its
wishes
,
for
the
hour
at
least
,
to
remaining
with
one
who
loved
and
sorrowed
for
the
same
human
being
that
she
did
.
  
<EOS>
But
no
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilson
was
inflexible
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
,
maybe
,
been
a
bit
hard
on
you
,
Mary
,
I
'll
own
that
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
abide
you
yet
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
remember
it
's
your
giddiness
as
has
wrought
this
woe
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
stay
with
Alice
,
and
perhaps
Mrs.
Davenport
may
come
help
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
put
up
with
you
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
may
look
on
you
different
,
maybe
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
Mary
turned
out
of
the
house
,
which
had
been
HIS
home
,
where
HE
was
loved
,
and
mourned
for
,
into
the
busy
,
desolate
,
crowded
street
,
where
they
were
crying
halfpenny
broadsides
,
giving
an
account
of
the
bloody
murder
,
the
coroner
's
inquest
,
and
a
raw
-
head
-
and
-
bloody-
bones
picture
of
the
suspected
murderer
,
James
Wilson
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mary
heard
not
;
she
heeded
not
.
 
<EOS>
She
staggered
on
like
one
in
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
With
hung
head
and
tottering
steps
,
she
instinctively
chose
the
shortest
cut
to
that
home
which
was
to
her
,
in
her
present
state
of
mind
,
only
the
hiding
-
place
of
four
walls
,
where
she
might
vent
her
agony
,
unseen
and
unnoticed
by
the
keen
unkind
world
without
,
but
where
no
welcome
,
no
love
,
no
sympathising
tears
awaited
her
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
neared
that
home
,
within
two
minutes
'
walk
of
it
,
her
impetuous
course
was
arrested
by
a
light
touch
on
her
arm
,
and
turning
hastily
<EOS>
she
saw
a
little
Italian
boy
with
his
humble
show
-
box
,
a
white
mouse
,
or
some
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
The
setting
sun
cast
its
red
glow
on
his
face
,
otherwise
the
olive
complexion
would
have
been
very
pale
;
and
the
glittering
tear
-
drops
hung
on
the
long
-
curled
eye
-
lashes
.
 
<EOS>
With
his
soft
voice
and
pleading
looks
,
he
uttered
,
in
his
pretty
broken
English
,
the
words
   
<EOS>
"
Hungry
!
<EOS>
so
hungry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
as
if
to
aid
by
gesture
the
effect
of
the
solitary
word
,
he
pointed
to
his
mouth
,
with
its
white
quivering
lips
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
answered
him
impatiently
,
"
O
lad
,
hunger
is
nothing
 
nothing
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
she
rapidly
passed
on
.
 
<EOS>
But
her
heart
upbraided
her
the
next
minute
with
her
unrelenting
speech
,
and
she
hastily
entered
her
door
and
seized
the
scanty
remnant
of
food
which
the
cupboard
contained
,
and
she
retraced
her
steps
to
the
place
where
the
little
hopeless
stranger
had
sunk
down
by
his
mute
companion
in
loneliness
and
starvation
,
and
was
raining
down
tears
as
he
spoke
in
some
foreign
tongue
,
with
low
cries
for
the
far
distant
"
Mamma
mia
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
the
elasticity
of
heart
belonging
to
childhood
he
sprang
up
as
he
saw
the
food
the
girl
brought
;
she
whose
face
,
lovely
in
its
woe
,
had
tempted
him
first
to
address
her
;
and
,
with
the
graceful
courtesy
of
his
country
,
he
looked
up
and
smiled
while
he
kissed
her
hand
,
and
then
poured
forth
his
thanks
,
and
shared
her
bounty
with
his
little
pet
companion
.
 
<EOS>
She
stood
an
instant
,
diverted
from
the
thought
of
her
own
grief
by
the
sight
of
his
infantine
gladness
;
and
then
bending
down
and
kissing
his
smooth
forehead
,
she
left
him
,
and
sought
to
be
alone
with
her
agony
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
She
re
-
entered
the
house
,
locked
the
door
,
and
tore
off
her
bonnet
,
as
if
greedy
of
every
moment
which
took
her
from
the
full
indulgence
of
painful
,
despairing
thought
.
  
<EOS>
Then
she
threw
herself
on
the
ground
,
yes
,
on
the
hard
flags
she
threw
her
soft
limbs
down
;
and
the
comb
fell
out
of
her
hair
,
and
those
bright
tresses
swept
the
dusty
floor
,
while
she
pillowed
and
hid
her
face
on
her
arms
,
and
burst
forth
into
loud
,
suffocating
sobs
.
  
<EOS>
O
earth
!
<EOS>
thou
didst
seem
but
a
dreary
dwelling
-
place
for
thy
poor
child
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
None
to
comfort
,
none
to
pity
!
 
<EOS>
And
self
-
reproach
gnawing
at
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
why
did
she
ever
listen
to
the
tempter
?
 
<EOS>
Why
did
she
ever
give
ear
to
her
own
suggestions
,
and
cravings
after
wealth
and
grandeur
?
<EOS>
Why
had
she
thought
it
a
fine
thing
to
have
a
rich
lover
?
  
<EOS>
She
 
she
had
deserved
it
all
:
but
he
was
the
victim
,
 
he
,
the
beloved
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
conjecture
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
even
pause
to
think
who
had
revealed
,
or
how
he
had
discovered
her
acquaintance
with
Harry
Carson
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
but
too
clear
,
<EOS>
some
way
or
another
,
he
had
learnt
all
;
and
what
would
he
think
of
her
?
 
<EOS>
No
hope
of
his
love
,
 
<EOS>
oh
,
that
she
would
give
up
,
and
be
content
:
it
was
his
life
,
his
precious
life
,
that
was
threatened
!
 
<EOS>
Then
she
tried
to
recall
the
particulars
,
which
,
when
Mrs.
Wilson
had
given
them
,
had
fallen
but
upon
a
deafened
ear
,
 
something
about
a
gun
,
a
quarrel
,
which
she
could
not
remember
clearly
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
terrible
to
think
of
his
crime
,
his
blood
-
guiltiness
;
he
who
had
hitherto
been
so
good
,
so
noble
,
and
now
an
assassin
!
 
<EOS>
And
then
she
shrank
from
him
in
thought
;
and
then
,
with
bitter
remorse
,
clung
more
closely
to
his
image
with
passionate
self
-
upbraiding
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
not
she
who
had
led
him
to
the
pit
into
which
he
had
fallen
?
 
<EOS>
Was
she
to
blame
him
?
 
<EOS>
She
to
judge
him
?
 
<EOS>
Who
could
tell
how
maddened
he
might
have
been
by
jealousy
;
how
one
moment
's
uncontrollable
passion
might
have
led
him
to
become
a
murderer
!
 
<EOS>
And
she
had
blamed
him
in
her
heart
after
his
last
deprecating
,
imploring
,
prophetic
speech
!
  
<EOS>
Then
she
burst
out
crying
afresh
;
and
when
weary
of
crying
,
fell
to
thinking
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
gallows
!
 
<EOS>
The
gallows
!
 
<EOS>
Black
it
stood
against
the
burning
light
which
dazzled
her
shut
eyes
,
press
on
them
as
she
would
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
she
was
going
mad
;
and
for
awhile
she
lay
outwardly
still
,
but
with
the
pulses
careering
through
her
head
with
wild
vehemence
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
came
a
strange
forgetfulness
of
the
present
,
in
thought
of
the
long
-
past
times
;
 
of
those
days
when
she
hid
her
face
on
her
mother
's
pitying
,
loving
bosom
,
and
heard
tender
words
of
comfort
,
be
her
grief
or
her
error
<EOS>
what
it
might
;
 
of
those
days
when
she
had
felt
as
if
her
mother
's
love
was
too
mighty
not
to
last
for
ever
;
 
of
those
days
when
hunger
had
been
to
her
(
as
to
the
little
stranger
she
had
that
evening
relieved
)
something
to
be
thought
about
,
and
mourned
over
;
 
when
Jem
and
she
had
played
together
;
<EOS>
he
,
with
the
condescension
of
an
older
child
,
and
she
,
with
unconscious
earnestness
,
believing
that
he
was
as
much
gratified
with
important
trifles
as
she
was
;
 
when
her
father
was
a
cheery
-
hearted
man
,
rich
in
the
love
of
his
wife
,
and
the
companionship
of
his
friend
;
 
when
(
for
it
still
worked
round
to
that
)
,
when
mother
was
alive
,
and
HE
was
not
a
murderer
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
Heaven
blessed
her
unaware
,
and
she
sank
from
remembering
,
to
wandering
,
unconnected
thought
,
and
thence
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
it
was
sleep
,
though
in
that
strange
posture
,
on
that
hard
cold
bed
;
and
she
dreamt
of
the
happy
times
of
long
ago
,
and
her
mother
came
to
her
,
and
kissed
her
as
she
lay
,
and
once
more
the
dead
were
alive
again
in
that
happy
world
of
dreams
.
 
<EOS>
All
was
restored
to
the
gladness
of
childhood
,
even
to
the
little
kitten
which
had
been
her
playmate
and
bosom
friend
then
,
and
which
had
been
long
forgotten
in
her
waking
hours
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
loved
ones
were
there
!
  
<EOS>
She
suddenly
wakened
!
 
<EOS>
Clear
and
wide
awake
!
 
<EOS>
Some
noise
had
startled
her
from
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
up
,
and
put
her
hair
(
still
wet
with
tears
)
back
from
her
flushed
cheeks
,
and
listened
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
she
could
only
hear
her
beating
heart
.
 
<EOS>
All
was
still
without
,
for
it
was
after
midnight
,
such
hours
of
agony
had
passed
away
;
but
the
moon
shone
clearly
in
at
the
unshuttered
window
,
making
the
room
almost
as
light
as
day
,
in
its
cold
ghastly
radiance
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
low
knock
at
the
door
!
 
<EOS>
A
strange
feeling
crept
over
Mary
's
heart
,
as
if
something
spiritual
were
near
;
as
if
the
dead
,
so
lately
present
in
her
dreams
,
were
yet
gliding
and
hovering
round
her
,
with
their
dim
,
dread
forms
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
,
why
dread
?
 
<EOS>
Had
they
not
loved
her
?
 
<EOS>
and
who
loved
her
now
?
 
<EOS>
Was
she
not
lonely
enough
to
welcome
the
spirits
of
the
dead
,
who
had
loved
her
while
here
?
 
<EOS>
If
her
mother
had
conscious
being
,
her
love
for
her
child
endured
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
quieted
her
fears
,
and
listened
 
listened
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
Mary
!
open
the
door
!
"
<EOS>
as
a
little
movement
on
her
part
seemed
to
tell
the
being
outside
of
her
wakeful
,
watchful
state
.
<EOS>
They
were
the
accents
of
her
mother
's
voice
;
the
very
south
-
country
pronunciation
,
that
Mary
so
well
remembered
;
and
which
she
had
sometimes
tried
to
imitate
when
alone
,
with
the
fond
mimicry
of
affection
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
without
fear
,
without
hesitation
,
she
rose
and
unbarred
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
against
the
moonlight
,
stood
a
form
,
so
closely
resembling
her
dead
mother
,
that
Mary
never
doubted
the
identity
,
but
exclaiming
(
as
if
she
were
a
terrified
child
,
secure
of
safety
when
near
the
protecting
care
of
its
parent
)
    
"
O
mother
!
<EOS>
mother
!
<EOS>
you
are
come
at
last
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
threw
herself
,
or
rather
fell
,
into
the
trembling
arms
of
her
long
-
lost
,
unrecognised
aunt
,
Esther
.
   
<EOS>
ESTHER
'S
MOTIVE
IN
SEEKING
MARY
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
rest
is
gone
,
My
heart
is
sore
,
Peace
find
I
never
,
And
never
more
.
"

MARGARET
'S
SONG
IN
"
FAUST
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
must
go
back
a
little
to
explain
the
motives
which
caused
Esther
to
seek
an
interview
with
her
niece
.
  
<EOS>
The
murder
had
been
committed
early
on
Thursday
night
,
and
between
then
and
the
dawn
of
the
following
day
there
was
ample
time
for
the
news
to
spread
far
and
wide
among
all
those
whose
duty
,
or
whose
want
,
or
whose
errors
,
caused
them
to
be
abroad
in
the
streets
of
Manchester
.
  
<EOS>
Among
those
who
listened
to
the
tale
of
violence
was
Esther
.
  
<EOS>
A
craving
desire
to
know
more
took
possession
of
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Far
away
as
she
was
from
Turner
Street
,
she
immediately
set
off
to
the
scene
of
the
murder
,
which
was
faintly
lighted
by
the
grey
dawn
as
she
reached
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
so
quiet
and
still
that
she
could
hardly
believe
it
to
be
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
vestige
of
any
scuffle
or
violence
was
a
trail
on
the
dust
,
as
if
somebody
had
been
lying
there
,
and
then
been
raised
by
extraneous
force
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
birds
were
beginning
to
hop
and
twitter
in
the
leafless
hedge
,
making
the
only
sound
that
was
near
and
distinct
.
 
<EOS>
She
crossed
into
the
field
where
she
guessed
the
murderer
to
have
stood
;
it
was
easy
of
access
,
for
the
worn
,
stunted
hawthorn
-
hedge
had
many
gaps
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
-
smell
of
bruised
grass
came
up
from
under
her
feet
,
as
she
went
towards
the
saw
-
pit
and
carpenter
's
shed
which
,
as
I
have
said
before
,
were
in
a
corner
of
the
field
near
the
road
,
and
where
one
of
her
informants
had
told
her
it
was
supposed
by
the
police
that
the
murderer
had
lurked
while
waiting
for
his
victim
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
sign
,
however
,
that
any
one
had
been
about
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
grass
had
been
bruised
or
bent
where
he
had
trod
,
it
had
had
enough
of
the
elasticity
of
life
to
raise
itself
under
the
dewy
influences
of
night
.
 
<EOS>
She
hushed
her
breath
in
involuntary
awe
,
but
nothing
else
told
of
the
violent
deed
by
which
a
fellow
-
creature
had
passed
away
.
<EOS>
She
stood
still
for
a
minute
,
imagining
to
herself
the
position
of
the
parties
,
guided
by
the
only
circumstance
which
afforded
any
evidence
,
the
trailing
mark
on
the
dust
in
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
(
it
was
before
the
sun
had
risen
above
the
horizon
)
<EOS>
she
became
aware
of
something
white
in
the
hedge
.
 
<EOS>
All
other
colours
wore
the
same
murky
hue
,
though
the
forms
of
objects
were
perfectly
distinct
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
it
?
 
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
a
flower
;
 
that
,
the
time
of
year
made
clear
.
 
<EOS>
A
frozen
lump
of
snow
,
lingering
late
in
one
of
the
gnarled
tufts
of
the
hedge
?
 
<EOS>
She
stepped
forward
to
examine
.
 
<EOS>
It
proved
to
be
a
little
piece
of
stiff
writing
-
paper
compressed
into
a
round
shape
.
 
<EOS>
She
understood
it
instantly
;
it
was
the
paper
that
had
served
as
wadding
for
the
murderer
's
gun
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
had
been
standing
just
where
the
murderer
must
have
been
but
a
few
hours
before
;
probably
(
as
the
rumour
had
spread
through
the
town
,
reaching
her
ears
)
<EOS>
one
of
the
poor
maddened
turn
-
outs
,
who
hung
about
everywhere
,
with
black
,
fierce
looks
,
as
if
contemplating
some
deed
of
violence
.
 
<EOS>
Her
sympathy
was
all
with
them
,
for
she
had
known
what
they
suffered
;
and
besides
this
,
there
was
her
own
individual
dislike
of
Mr.
Carson
,
and
dread
of
him
for
Mary
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
poor
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
Death
was
<EOS>
a
terrible
,
though
sure
,
remedy
for
the
evil
Esther
had
dreaded
for
her
;
and
how
would
she
stand
the
shock
,
loving
as
her
aunt
believed
her
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
Poor
Mary
!
<EOS>
who
would
comfort
her
?
<EOS>
Esther
's
thoughts
began
to
picture
her
sorrow
,
her
despair
,
when
the
news
of
her
lover
's
death
should
reach
her
;
and
she
longed
to
tell
her
there
might
have
been
a
keener
grief
yet
had
he
lived
.
  
<EOS>
Bright
,
beautiful
came
the
slanting
rays
of
the
morning
sun
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
time
for
such
as
she
to
hide
themselves
,
with
the
other
obscene
things
of
night
,
from
the
glorious
light
of
day
,
which
was
only
for
the
happy
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
turned
her
steps
towards
town
,
still
holding
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
getting
over
the
hedge
it
encumbered
her
to
hold
it
in
her
clasped
hand
,
and
she
threw
it
down
.
 
<EOS>
She
passed
on
a
few
steps
,
her
thoughts
still
of
Mary
,
till
the
idea
crossed
her
mind
,
<EOS>
could
it
(
blank
as
it
appeared
to
be
)
give
any
clue
to
the
murderer
?
<EOS>
As
I
said
before
,
her
sympathies
were
all
on
that
side
,
so
she
turned
back
and
picked
it
up
;
and
then
feeling
as
if
in
some
measure
an
accessory
,
she
hid
it
unexamined
in
her
hand
,
and
hastily
passed
out
of
the
street
at
the
opposite
end
to
that
by
which
she
had
entered
it
.
  
<EOS>
And
what
do
you
think
she
felt
,
when
having
walked
some
distance
from
the
spot
,
she
dared
to
open
the
crushed
paper
,
and
saw
written
on
it
Mary
Barton
's
name
,
and
not
only
that
,
but
the
street
in
which
she
lived
!
 
<EOS>
True
,
a
letter
or
two
was
torn
off
,
but
,
nevertheless
,
there
was
the
name
clear
to
be
recognised
.
 
<EOS>
And
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
what
terrible
thought
flashed
into
her
mind
;
or
was
it
only
fancy
?
 
<EOS>
But
it
looked
very
like
the
writing
which
she
had
once
known
<EOS>
well
 
<EOS>
the
writing
of
Jem
Wilson
,
who
,
when
she
lived
at
her
brother
-
in
-
law
's
,
and
he
was
a
near
neighbour
,
had
often
been
employed
by
her
to
write
her
letters
to
people
,
to
whom
she
was
ashamed
of
sending
her
own
misspelt
scrawl
.
 
<EOS>
She
remembered
the
wonderful
flourishes
she
had
so
much
admired
in
those
days
,
while
she
sat
by
dictating
,
and
Jem
,
in
all
the
pride
of
newly
-
acquired
penmanship
,
used
to
dazzle
her
eyes
by
extraordinary
graces
and
twirls
.
  
<EOS>
If
it
were
his
!
  
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
perhaps
it
was
merely
that
her
head
was
running
so
on
Mary
,
that
she
was
associating
every
trifle
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
As
if
only
one
person
wrote
in
that
flourishing
,
meandering
style
!
  
<EOS>
It
was
enough
to
fill
her
mind
to
think
from
what
she
might
have
saved
Mary
by
securing
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
look
at
it
just
once
more
,
and
see
if
some
very
dense
and
stupid
policeman
could
have
mistaken
the
name
,
or
if
Mary
would
certainly
have
been
dragged
into
notice
in
the
affair
.
  
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
no
one
could
have
mistaken
the
"
ry
Barton
,
"
and
it
WAS
Jem
's
handwriting
!
  
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
it
was
so
,
she
understood
it
all
,
and
she
had
been
the
cause
!
<EOS>
With
her
violent
and
unregulated
nature
,
rendered
morbid
by
the
course
of
life
she
led
,
and
her
consciousness
of
her
degradation
,
she
cursed
herself
for
the
interference
which
she
believed
had
led
to
this
;
for
the
information
and
the
warning
she
had
given
to
Jem
,
which
had
roused
him
to
this
murderous
action
.
 
<EOS>
How
could
she
,
the
abandoned
and
polluted
outcast
,
ever
have
dared
to
hope
for
a
blessing
,
even
on
her
efforts
to
do
good
.
 
<EOS>
The
black
curse
of
Heaven
rested
on
all
her
doings
,
were
they
for
good
or
for
evil
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
,
diseased
mind
!
<EOS>
and
there
were
none
to
minister
to
thee
!
  
<EOS>
So
she
wandered
about
,
too
restless
to
take
her
usual
heavy
morning
's
sleep
,
up
and
down
the
streets
,
greedily
listening
to
every
word
of
the
passers
-
by
,
and
loitering
near
each
group
of
talkers
,
anxious
to
scrape
together
every
morsel
of
information
,
or
conjecture
,
or
suspicion
,
though
without
possessing
any
definite
purpose
in
all
this
.
 
<EOS>
And
ever
and
always
she
clenched
the
scrap
of
paper
which
might
betray
so
much
,
until
her
nails
had
deeply
indented
the
palm
of
her
hand
;
so
fearful
was
she
in
her
nervous
dread
,
<EOS>
lest
unawares
<EOS>
she
should
let
it
drop
.
  
<EOS>
Towards
the
middle
of
the
day
she
could
no
longer
evade
the
body
's
craving
want
of
rest
and
refreshment
;
but
the
rest
was
taken
in
a
spirit
vault
,
and
the
refreshment
was
a
glass
of
gin
.
  
<EOS>
Then
she
started
up
from
the
stupor
she
had
taken
for
repose
;
and
suddenly
driven
before
the
gusty
impulses
of
her
mind
,
she
pushed
her
way
to
the
place
where
at
that
very
time
the
police
were
bringing
the
information
they
had
gathered
with
regard
to
the
all
-
engrossing
murder
.
  
<EOS>
She
listened
with
painful
acuteness
of
comprehension
to
dropped
words
,
and
unconnected
sentences
,
the
meaning
of
which
became
clearer
,
and
yet
more
clear
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
was
suspected
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
was
ascertained
to
be
the
murderer
.
  
<EOS>
She
saw
him
(
although
he
,
absorbed
in
deep
sad
thought
,
saw
her
not
)
,
she
saw
him
brought
handcuffed
and
guarded
out
of
the
coach
.
<EOS>
She
saw
him
enter
the
station
 
<EOS>
she
gasped
for
breath
till
he
came
out
,
still
handcuffed
,
and
still
guarded
,
to
be
conveyed
to
the
New
Bailey
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
the
only
one
who
had
spoken
to
her
with
hope
that
she
might
win
her
way
back
to
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
His
words
had
lingered
in
her
heart
with
a
sort
of
call
to
heaven
,
like
distant
Sabbath
bells
,
although
in
her
despair
she
had
turned
away
from
his
voice
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
only
one
who
had
spoken
to
her
kindly
.
 
<EOS>
The
murder
,
shocking
though
it
was
,
was
an
absent
,
abstract
thing
,
on
which
her
thoughts
could
not
,
and
would
not
dwell
:
<EOS>
all
that
was
present
in
her
mind
was
Jem
's
danger
,
and
his
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Mary
came
to
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
Esther
wondered
till
she
was
sick
of
wondering
,
in
what
way
she
was
taking
the
affair
.
 
<EOS>
In
some
manner
it
would
be
a
terrible
blow
for
the
poor
,
motherless
girl
;
with
her
dreadful
father
,
too
,
who
was
to
Esther
a
sort
of
accusing
angel
.
  
<EOS>
She
set
off
towards
the
court
where
Mary
lived
,
to
pick
up
what
she
could
there
of
information
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
was
ashamed
to
enter
in
where
once
she
had
been
innocent
,
and
hung
about
the
neighbouring
streets
,
not
daring
to
question
,
so
she
learnt
but
little
;
nothing
,
in
fact
,
but
the
knowledge
of
John
Barton
's
absence
from
home
.
  
<EOS>
She
went
up
a
dark
entry
to
rest
her
weary
limbs
on
a
doorstep
and
think
.
 
<EOS>
Her
elbows
on
her
knees
,
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands
,
she
tried
to
gather
together
and
arrange
her
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
But
still
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
she
opened
her
hand
to
see
if
the
paper
were
yet
there
.
  
<EOS>
She
got
up
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
formed
a
plan
,
and
had
a
course
of
action
to
look
forward
to
that
would
satisfy
one
craving
desire
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
The
time
was
long
gone
by
when
there
was
much
wisdom
or
consistency
in
her
projects
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
getting
late
,
and
that
was
so
much
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
She
went
to
a
pawnshop
,
and
took
off
her
finery
in
a
back
room
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
known
by
the
people
,
and
had
a
character
for
honesty
,
so
she
had
no
very
great
difficulty
in
inducing
them
to
let
her
have
a
suit
of
outer
clothes
,
befitting
the
wife
of
a
working
-
man
,
a
black
silk
bonnet
,
a
printed
gown
,
a
plaid
shawl
,
dirty
and
rather
worn
to
be
sure
,
but
which
had
a
sort
of
sanctity
to
the
eyes
of
the
street
-
walker
as
being
the
appropriate
garb
of
that
happy
class
to
which
she
could
never
,
never
more
belong
.
  
<EOS>
She
looked
at
herself
in
the
little
glass
which
hung
against
the
wall
,
and
sadly
shaking
her
head
<EOS>
thought
how
easy
were
the
duties
of
that
Eden
of
innocence
from
which
she
was
shut
out
;
how
she
would
work
,
and
toil
,
and
starve
,
and
die
,
if
necessary
,
for
a
husband
,
a
home
 
for
children
 
<EOS>
but
that
thought
she
could
not
bear
;
a
little
form
rose
up
,
stern
in
its
innocence
,
from
the
witches
'
caldron
of
her
imagination
,
and
she
rushed
into
action
again
.
  
<EOS>
You
know
now
how
she
came
to
stand
by
the
threshold
of
Mary
's
door
,
waiting
,
trembling
,
until
the
latch
was
lifted
,
and
her
niece
,
with
words
that
spoke
of
such
desolation
among
the
living
,
fell
into
her
arms
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
felt
as
if
some
holy
spell
would
prevent
her
(
even
as
the
unholy
Lady
Geraldine
was
prevented
,
in
the
abode
of
Christabel
)
from
crossing
the
threshold
of
that
home
of
her
early
innocence
;
and
she
had
meant
to
wait
for
an
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mary
's
helpless
action
did
away
with
all
reluctant
feeling
,
and
she
bore
or
dragged
her
to
her
seat
,
and
looked
on
her
bewildered
eyes
,
as
,
puzzled
with
the
likeness
,
which
was
not
identity
<EOS>
,
she
gazed
on
her
aunt
's
features
.
  
<EOS>
In
pursuance
of
her
plan
,
Esther
meant
to
assume
the
manners
and
character
,
as
she
had
done
the
dress
,
of
a
mechanic
's
wife
;
but
then
,
to
account
for
her
long
absence
,
and
her
long
silence
towards
all
that
ought
to
have
been
dear
to
her
,
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
put
on
an
indifference
far
distant
from
her
heart
,
which
was
loving
and
yearning
,
in
spite
of
all
its
faults
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
perhaps
,
she
over
-
acted
her
part
,
for
<EOS>
certainly
Mary
felt
a
kind
of
repugnance
to
the
changed
and
altered
aunt
,
who
so
suddenly
reappeared
on
the
scene
;
and
it
would
have
cut
Esther
to
the
very
core
,
could
she
have
known
how
her
little
darling
of
former
days
was
feeling
towards
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
remember
me
,
I
see
,
Mary
!
"
<EOS>
she
began
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
long
while
since
I
left
you
all
,
to
be
sure
;
and
I
,
many
a
time
,
thought
of
coming
to
see
you
,
and
 
and
your
father
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
live
so
far
off
,
and
am
always
so
busy
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
do
just
what
I
wish
.
 
<EOS>
You
recollect
aunt
Esther
,
do
n't
you
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
Aunt
Hetty
?
"
asked
Mary
faintly
,
still
looking
at
the
face
which
was
so
different
from
the
old
recollections
of
her
aunt
's
fresh
dazzling
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
I
am
Aunt
Hetty
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
's
so
long
since
I
heard
that
name
,
"
sighing
forth
the
thoughts
it
suggested
;
then
,
recovering
herself
,
and
striving
after
the
hard
character
she
wished
to
assume
,
she
continued
:
"
And
to
-
day
I
heard
a
friend
of
yours
,
and
of
mine
too
,
long
ago
,
was
in
trouble
,
and
I
guessed
you
would
be
in
sorrow
<EOS>
,
so
I
thought
I
would
just
step
this
far
and
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
's
tears
flowed
afresh
,
but
she
had
no
desire
to
open
her
heart
to
her
strangely
-
found
aunt
,
who
had
,
by
her
own
confession
,
kept
aloof
from
and
neglected
them
for
so
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
she
tried
to
feel
grateful
for
kindness
(
however
late
)
from
any
one
,
and
wished
to
be
civil
.
 
<EOS>
Moreover
,
she
had
a
strong
disinclination
to
speak
on
the
terrible
subject
uppermost
in
her
mind
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
after
a
pause
,
she
said
   
"
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
mean
very
kind
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
had
a
long
walk
?
 
<EOS>
I
'm
so
sorry
,
"
said
she
,
rising
with
a
sudden
thought
,
which
was
as
suddenly
checked
by
recollection
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
've
nothing
to
eat
in
the
house
,
and
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
you
must
be
hungry
,
after
your
walk
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
Mary
concluded
that
certainly
her
aunt
's
residence
must
be
far
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
,
out
of
sight
or
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
after
all
,
she
did
not
think
much
about
her
;
her
heart
was
so
aching
-
full
of
other
things
,
that
all
besides
seemed
like
a
dream
.
<EOS>
She
received
feelings
and
impressions
from
her
conversation
with
her
aunt
,
but
did
not
,
could
not
,
put
them
together
,
or
think
or
argue
about
them
.
  
<EOS>
And
Esther
!
<EOS>
How
scanty
had
been
her
food
for
days
and
weeks
,
her
thinly
-
covered
bones
and
pale
lips
might
tell
,
but
her
words
should
never
reveal
!
  
<EOS>
So
,
with
a
little
unreal
laugh
,
she
replied
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mary
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
do
n't
talk
about
eating
.
 
<EOS>
We
've
the
best
of
everything
,
and
plenty
of
it
,
for
my
husband
is
in
good
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
such
a
supper
before
I
came
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
touch
a
morsel
if
you
had
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
words
shot
a
strange
pang
through
Mary
's
heart
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
always
remembered
her
aunt
's
loving
and
unselfish
disposition
;
how
was
it
changed
,
if
,
living
in
plenty
,
she
had
never
thought
it
worth
while
to
ask
after
her
relations
who
were
all
but
starving
!
 
<EOS>
She
shut
up
her
heart
instinctively
against
her
aunt
.
  
<EOS>
And
all
the
time
poor
Esther
was
swallowing
her
sobs
,
and
over
-
acting
her
part
,
and
controlling
herself
more
than
she
had
done
for
many
a
long
day
,
in
order
that
her
niece
might
not
be
shocked
and
revolted
,
by
the
knowledge
of
what
her
aunt
had
become
 
a
prostitute
;
an
outcast
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
longed
to
open
her
wretched
,
wretched
heart
,
so
hopeless
,
so
abandoned
by
all
living
things
,
to
one
who
had
loved
her
once
;
and
yet
she
refrained
,
from
dread
of
the
averted
eye
,
the
altered
voice
,
the
internal
loathing
,
which
she
feared
such
disclosure
might
create
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
go
straight
to
the
subject
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
tarry
long
,
for
she
felt
unable
to
support
the
character
she
had
assumed
for
any
length
of
time
.
  
<EOS>
They
sat
by
the
little
round
table
,
facing
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
The
candle
was
placed
right
between
them
,
and
Esther
moved
it
in
order
to
have
a
clearer
view
of
Mary
's
face
,
so
that
she
might
read
her
emotions
,
and
ascertain
her
interests
.
  
<EOS>
Then
she
began
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
bad
business
<EOS>
,
I
'm
afraid
,
this
of
Mr.
Carson
's
murder
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
winced
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
Jem
Wilson
is
taken
up
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hands
,
as
if
to
shade
them
from
the
light
,
and
Esther
herself
,
less
accustomed
to
self
-
command
,
was
getting
too
much
agitated
for
calm
observation
of
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
taking
a
walk
near
Turner
Street
,
and
I
went
to
see
the
spot
,
"
continued
Esther
,
"
and
,
as
luck
would
have
it
<EOS>
,
I
spied
this
bit
of
paper
in
the
hedge
,
"
producing
the
precious
piece
still
folded
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
used
as
wadding
for
the
gun
,
I
reckon
;
indeed
,
that
's
clear
enough
,
from
the
shape
it
's
crammed
into
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
sorry
for
the
murderer
<EOS>
,
whoever
he
might
be
(
I
did
n't
then
know
of
Jem
's
being
suspected
)
,
and
I
thought
I
would
never
leave
a
thing
about
as
might
help
,
ever
so
little
,
to
convict
him
;
the
police
are
so
'
cute
about
straws
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
carried
it
a
little
way
,
and
then
I
opened
it
and
saw
your
name
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
took
her
hands
away
from
her
eyes
,
and
looked
with
surprise
at
her
aunt
's
face
,
as
she
uttered
these
words
.
 
<EOS>
She
WAS
kind
after
all
,
for
was
she
not
saving
her
from
being
summoned
,
and
from
being
questioned
and
examined
;
a
thing
to
be
dreaded
above
all
others
:
as
she
felt
sure
that
her
unwilling
answers
,
frame
them
how
she
might
,
would
add
to
the
suspicions
against
Jem
;
her
aunt
was
indeed
kind
,
to
think
of
what
would
spare
her
this
.
  
<EOS>
Esther
went
on
,
without
noticing
Mary
's
look
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
action
of
speaking
was
so
painful
to
her
,
and
so
much
interrupted
by
the
hard
,
raking
little
cough
,
which
had
been
her
constant
annoyance
for
months
,
that
she
was
too
much
engrossed
by
the
physical
difficulty
of
utterance
,
to
be
a
very
close
observer
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
could
be
no
mistake
if
they
had
found
it
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
your
name
,
together
with
the
very
name
of
this
court
!
 
<EOS>
And
in
Jem
's
handwriting
too
,
<EOS>
or
I
'm
much
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
Look
,
Mary
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
now
she
did
watch
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
took
the
paper
and
flattened
it
;
then
suddenly
stood
stiff
up
,
with
irrepressible
movement
,
as
if
petrified
by
some
horror
abruptly
disclosed
;
her
face
,
strung
and
rigid
;
her
lips
compressed
tight
,
to
keep
down
some
rising
exclamation
.
 
<EOS>
She
dropped
on
her
seat
,
as
suddenly
as
if
the
braced
muscles
had
in
an
instant
given
way
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
spoke
no
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
his
handwriting
 
is
n't
it
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Esther
,
though
Mary
's
manner
was
almost
confirmation
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
tell
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
will
tell
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Mary
,
in
a
tone
so
sternly
earnest
,
as
almost
to
be
threatening
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Mary
,
"
said
Esther
,
rather
reproachfully
,
"
I
am
not
so
bad
as
that
.
 
<EOS>
O
Mary
,
you
can
not
think
I
would
do
that
,
whatever
I
may
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
tears
sprang
to
her
eyes
at
the
idea
that
she
was
suspected
of
being
one
who
would
help
to
inform
against
an
old
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
caught
her
sad
and
upbraiding
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
I
know
you
would
not
tell
,
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
I
say
,
I
am
so
shocked
.
 
<EOS>
But
say
you
will
not
tell
.
 
<EOS>
Do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
I
willn't
tell
,
come
what
may
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
sat
still
looking
at
the
writing
,
and
turning
the
paper
round
with
careful
examination
,
trying
to
hope
,
but
her
very
fears
belying
her
hopes
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
cared
for
the
young
man
that
's
murdered
,
"
observed
Esther
,
half
-
aloud
;
but
feeling
that
she
could
not
mistake
this
strange
interest
in
the
suspected
murderer
,
implied
by
Mary
's
eagerness
to
screen
him
from
anything
which
might
strengthen
suspicion
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
come
,
desirous
to
know
the
extent
of
Mary
's
grief
for
Mr.
Carson
,
and
glad
of
the
excuse
afforded
her
by
the
important
scrap
of
paper
.
 
<EOS>
Her
remark
about
its
being
Jem
's
handwriting
<EOS>
,
she
had
,
with
this
view
of
ascertaining
Mary
's
state
of
feeling
,
felt
to
be
most
imprudent
the
instant
after
she
had
uttered
it
;
but
Mary
's
anxiety
that
she
should
not
tell
was
too
great
,
and
too
decided
,
to
leave
a
doubt
as
to
her
interest
for
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
She
grew
more
and
more
bewildered
,
and
her
dizzy
head
refused
to
reason
.
<EOS>
Mary
never
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
She
held
the
bit
of
paper
firmly
,
determined
to
retain
possession
of
it
<EOS>
,
come
what
might
;
and
anxious
,
and
impatient
,
for
her
aunt
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
sat
,
her
face
bore
a
likeness
to
Esther
's
dead
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
so
like
my
little
girl
,
Mary
!
"
<EOS>
said
Esther
,
weary
of
the
one
subject
on
which
she
could
get
no
satisfaction
,
and
recurring
,
with
full
heart
,
to
the
thought
of
the
dead
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
looked
up
.
 
<EOS>
Her
aunt
had
children
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
all
the
idea
she
received
.
 
<EOS>
No
faint
imagination
of
the
love
and
the
woe
of
that
poor
creature
crossed
her
mind
,
or
she
would
have
taken
her
,
all
guilty
and
erring
,
to
her
bosom
,
and
tried
to
bind
up
the
broken
heart
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
it
was
not
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Her
aunt
had
children
,
then
;
and
she
was
on
the
point
of
putting
some
question
about
them
,
but
before
it
could
be
spoken
another
thought
turned
it
aside
,
and
she
went
back
to
her
task
of
unravelling
the
mystery
of
the
paper
,
and
the
handwriting
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
she
wished
her
aunt
would
go
!
  
<EOS>
As
if
,
according
to
the
believers
in
mesmerism
,
the
intenseness
of
her
wish
gave
her
power
over
another
,
although
the
wish
was
unexpressed
,
Esther
felt
herself
unwelcome
,
and
that
her
absence
was
desired
.
  
<EOS>
She
felt
this
some
time
before
she
could
summon
up
resolution
to
go
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
much
disappointed
in
this
longed
-
for
,
dreaded
interview
with
Mary
;
she
had
wished
to
impose
upon
her
with
her
tale
of
married
respectability
,
and
yet
she
had
yearned
and
craved
for
sympathy
in
her
real
lot
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
had
imposed
upon
her
well
.
 
<EOS>
She
should
perhaps
be
glad
of
it
afterwards
;
but
her
desolation
of
hope
seemed
for
the
time
redoubled
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
must
leave
the
old
dwelling
-
place
,
<EOS>
whose
very
walls
,
and
flags
,
dingy
and
sordid
as
they
were
,
had
a
charm
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
Must
leave
the
abode
of
poverty
,
for
the
more
terrible
abodes
of
vice
.
 
<EOS>
She
must
 
<EOS>
she
would
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
good
-
night
,
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
That
bit
of
paper
is
safe
enough
with
you
,
I
see
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
made
me
promise
I
would
not
tell
about
it
,
and
you
must
promise
me
to
destroy
it
before
you
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
promise
,
"
said
Mary
hoarsely
,
but
firmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
going
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Not
if
you
wish
me
to
stay
.
 
<EOS>
Not
if
I
could
be
of
any
comfort
to
you
,
Mary
"
;
catching
at
some
glimmering
hope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
"
said
Mary
,
anxious
to
be
alone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
husband
will
be
wondering
where
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
Some
day
you
must
tell
me
all
about
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
I
forget
what
your
name
is
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fergusson
,
"
said
Esther
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Fergusson
,
"
repeated
Mary
half
unconsciously
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
where
did
you
say
you
lived
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
did
say
,
"
muttered
Esther
;
then
aloud
,
"
In
Angel
's
Meadow
,
145
,
Nicholas
Street
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
145
,
Nicholas
Street
,
Angel
Meadow
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
remember
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
Esther
drew
her
shawl
around
her
,
and
prepared
to
depart
,
a
thought
crossed
Mary
's
mind
that
she
had
been
cold
and
hard
in
her
manner
towards
one
,
who
had
certainly
meant
to
act
kindly
in
bringing
her
the
paper
(
that
dread
,
terrible
piece
of
paper
!
)
<EOS>
and
thus
saving
her
from
 
<EOS>
she
could
not
rightly
think
how
much
,
or
how
little
she
was
spared
.
 
<EOS>
So
desirous
of
making
up
for
her
previous
indifferent
manner
,
she
advanced
to
kiss
her
aunt
before
her
departure
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
to
her
surprise
,
her
aunt
pushed
her
off
with
a
frantic
kind
of
gesture
,
and
saying
the
words
   
"
<EOS>
Not
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
never
kiss
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
rushed
into
the
outer
darkness
of
the
street
,
and
there
wept
long
and
bitterly
.
   
<EOS>
MARY
'S
EFFORTS
TO
PROVE
AN
ALIBI
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
listening
fear
in
her
regard
,
As
if
calamity
had
but
begun
;
As
if
the
vanward
clouds
of
evil
days
Had
spent
their
malice
,
and
the
sullen
rear
Was
,
with
its
stored
thunder
,
labouring
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
KEATS
'
Hyperion
.
  
<EOS>
No
sooner
was
Mary
alone
than
she
fastened
the
door
,
and
put
the
shutters
up
against
the
window
,
which
had
all
this
time
remained
shaded
only
by
the
curtains
hastily
drawn
together
on
Esther
's
entrance
,
and
the
lighting
of
the
candle
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
all
this
with
the
same
compressed
lips
,
and
the
same
stony
look
that
her
face
had
assumed
on
the
first
examination
of
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
sat
down
for
an
instant
to
think
;
and
rising
directly
,
went
,
with
a
step
rendered
firm
by
inward
resolution
of
purpose
,
up
the
stairs
;
passed
her
own
door
,
two
steps
,
into
her
father
's
room
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
she
want
there
?
  
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
;
I
must
put
into
words
the
dreadful
secret
which
she
believed
that
bit
of
paper
had
revealed
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
was
the
murderer
.
  
<EOS>
That
corner
of
stiff
,
shining
,
thick
,
writing
paper
,
she
recognised
as
a
part
of
the
sheet
on
which
she
had
copied
Samuel
Bamford
's
beautiful
lines
so
many
months
ago
 
copied
(
as
you
perhaps
remember
)
on
the
blank
part
of
a
valentine
sent
to
her
by
Jem
Wilson
,
in
those
days
when
she
did
not
treasure
and
hoard
up
everything
he
had
touched
,
as
she
would
do
now
.
  
<EOS>
That
copy
had
been
given
to
her
father
,
for
whom
it
was
made
,
and
she
had
occasionally
seen
him
reading
it
over
,
not
<EOS>
a
fortnight
ago
she
was
sure
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
resolved
to
ascertain
if
the
other
part
still
remained
in
his
possession
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
 
<EOS>
it
was
just
possible
<EOS>
he
MIGHT
,
have
given
it
away
to
some
friend
;
and
if
so
,
that
person
was
the
guilty
one
,
for
she
could
swear
to
the
paper
anywhere
.
  
<EOS>
First
of
all
she
pulled
out
every
article
from
the
little
old
chest
of
drawers
.
 
<EOS>
Amongst
them
were
some
things
which
had
belonged
to
her
mother
,
but
she
had
no
time
now
to
examine
and
try
and
remember
them
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
reverence
she
could
pay
them
was
to
carry
them
and
lay
them
on
the
bed
carefully
,
while
the
other
things
were
tossed
impatiently
out
upon
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
The
copy
of
Bamford
's
lines
was
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
perhaps
he
might
have
given
it
away
;
but
then
must
it
not
have
been
to
Jem
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
his
gun
.
  
<EOS>
And
she
set
to
with
redoubled
vigour
to
examine
the
deal
box
which
served
as
chair
,
and
which
had
once
contained
her
father
's
Sunday
clothes
,
in
the
days
when
he
could
afford
to
have
Sunday
clothes
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
redeemed
his
better
coat
from
the
pawn
-
shop
before
he
left
,
that
she
had
noticed
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
his
old
one
.
 
<EOS>
What
rustled
under
her
hand
in
the
pocket
?
  
<EOS>
The
paper
!
 
<EOS>
"
O
father
!
"
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
it
fitted
;
<EOS>
jagged
end
to
jagged
end
,
letter
to
letter
,
and
even
the
part
which
Esther
had
considered
blank
<EOS>
had
its
tallying
mark
with
the
larger
piece
,
its
tails
of
ys
and
gs
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
as
if
that
were
not
damning
evidence
enough
,
she
felt
again
,
and
found
some
little
bullets
or
shot
(
I
do
n't
know
which
you
would
call
them
)
in
that
same
pocket
,
along
with
a
small
paper
parcel
of
gunpowder
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
was
going
to
replace
the
jacket
,
having
abstracted
the
paper
,
and
bullets
,
etc
.
,
she
saw
a
woollen
gun
-
case
made
of
that
sort
of
striped
horse
-
cloth
<EOS>
you
must
have
seen
a
thousand
times
appropriated
to
such
a
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
The
sight
of
it
made
her
examine
still
further
,
but
there
was
nothing
else
that
could
afford
any
evidence
,
so
she
locked
the
box
,
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
to
contemplate
the
articles
;
now
with
a
sickening
despair
,
now
with
a
kind
of
wondering
curiosity
,
how
her
father
had
managed
to
evade
observation
.
 
<EOS>
After
all
it
was
easy
enough
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
evidently
got
possession
of
some
gun
<EOS>
(
was
it
really
<EOS>
Jem
's
?
<EOS>
was
he
an
accomplice
?
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
she
did
not
believe
it
;
he
never
,
never
would
deliberately
plan
a
murder
with
another
,
however
he
might
be
wrought
up
to
it
by
passionate
feeling
at
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
Least
of
all
would
he
accuse
her
to
her
father
,
without
previously
warning
her
;
it
was
out
of
his
nature
)
.
  
<EOS>
Then
having
obtained
possession
of
the
gun
,
her
father
had
loaded
it
at
home
,
and
might
have
carried
it
away
with
him
some
time
when
the
neighbours
were
not
noticing
,
and
she
was
out
,
or
asleep
;
and
then
he
might
have
hidden
it
somewhere
to
be
in
readiness
when
he
should
want
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
sure
he
had
no
such
thing
with
him
when
he
went
away
the
last
time
.
  
<EOS>
She
felt
it
was
of
no
use
to
conjecture
his
motives
.
 
<EOS>
His
actions
had
become
so
wild
and
irregular
of
late
,
that
she
could
not
reason
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
was
it
not
enough
to
know
that
he
was
guilty
of
this
terrible
offence
?
 
<EOS>
Her
love
for
her
father
seemed
to
return
with
painful
force
,
mixed
up
as
it
was
with
horror
at
his
crime
.
<EOS>
That
dear
father
who
was
once
so
kind
,
so
warm
-
hearted
,
so
ready
to
help
either
man
or
beast
in
distress
,
to
murder
!
 
<EOS>
But
in
the
desert
of
misery
with
which
these
thoughts
surrounded
her
,
the
arid
depths
of
whose
gloom
she
dared
not
venture
to
contemplate
,
a
little
spring
of
comfort
was
gushing
up
at
her
feet
,
unnoticed
at
first
,
but
soon
to
give
her
strength
and
hope
.
  
<EOS>
And
THAT
was
the
necessity
for
exertion
on
her
part
which
this
discovery
enforced
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
do
think
that
the
necessity
for
exertion
,
for
some
kind
of
action
(
bodily
or
mental
)
in
time
of
distress
,
is
a
most
infinite
blessing
,
although
the
first
efforts
at
such
seasons
are
painful
.
<EOS>
Something
to
be
done
implies
that
there
is
yet
hope
of
some
good
thing
to
be
accomplished
,
or
some
additional
evil
that
may
be
avoided
;
and
by
degrees
the
hope
absorbs
much
of
the
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
the
woes
that
can
not
in
any
earthly
way
be
escaped
that
admit
least
earthly
comforting
.
 
<EOS>
Of
all
trite
,
worn
-
out
,
hollow
mockeries
of
comfort
that
were
ever
uttered
by
people
who
will
not
take
the
trouble
of
sympathising
with
others
,
<EOS>
the
one
I
dislike
the
most
is
the
exhortation
not
to
grieve
over
an
event
,
"
for
it
can
not
be
helped
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
if
I
could
help
it
,
I
would
sit
still
with
folded
hands
,
content
to
mourn
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
not
believe
that
as
long
as
hope
remained
I
would
be
up
and
doing
?
 
<EOS>
I
mourn
because
what
has
occurred
can
not
be
helped
.
 
<EOS>
The
reason
you
give
me
for
not
grieving
,
is
the
very
sole
reason
of
my
grief
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
nobler
and
higher
reasons
for
enduring
meekly
what
my
Father
sees
fit
to
send
,
and
I
will
try
earnestly
and
faithfully
to
be
patient
;
but
mock
me
not
,
or
any
other
mourner
,
with
the
speech
,
"
Do
not
grieve
,
for
it
can
not
be
helped
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
past
remedy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
some
remedy
to
Mary
's
sorrow
came
with
thinking
.
 
<EOS>
If
her
father
was
guilty
,
Jem
was
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
If
innocent
,
there
was
a
possibility
of
saving
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
be
saved
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
must
do
it
;
for
,
was
not
she
the
sole
depository
of
the
terrible
secret
?
 
<EOS>
Her
father
was
not
suspected
;
and
never
should
be
,
if
by
any
foresight
or
any
exertions
of
her
own
she
could
prevent
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
know
how
Jem
was
to
be
saved
,
while
her
father
was
also
to
be
considered
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
require
much
thought
and
much
prudence
.
 
<EOS>
But
with
the
call
upon
her
exertions
,
and
her
various
qualities
of
judgment
and
discretion
,
came
the
answering
consciousness
of
innate
power
to
meet
the
emergency
.
 
<EOS>
Every
step
now
,
nay
,
the
employment
of
every
minute
was
of
consequence
;
for
you
must
remember
she
had
learnt
at
Miss
Simmonds
'
the
probability
that
the
murderer
would
be
brought
to
trial
the
next
week
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
must
remember
,
too
,
that
never
was
so
young
a
girl
so
friendless
,
or
so
penniless
,
as
Mary
was
at
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
lion
accompanied
Una
through
the
wilderness
and
the
danger
;
and
so
will
a
high
,
resolved
purpose
of
right
-
doing
ever
guard
and
accompany
the
helpless
.
  
<EOS>
It
struck
two
;
deep
,
mirk
night
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
of
no
use
bewildering
herself
with
plans
this
weary
,
endless
night
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
done
before
morning
;
and
,
at
first
in
her
impatience
,
she
began
to
long
for
day
;
but
then
she
felt
in
how
unfit
a
state
her
body
was
for
any
plan
of
exertion
,
and
she
resolutely
made
up
her
mind
to
husband
her
physical
strength
.
  
<EOS>
First
of
all
she
must
burn
the
tell
-
tale
paper
.
 
<EOS>
The
powder
,
bullets
,
and
gun
-
case
,
she
tied
into
a
bundle
,
and
hid
in
the
sacking
of
the
bed
for
the
present
,
although
there
was
no
likelihood
of
their
affording
evidence
against
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
carried
the
paper
downstairs
,
and
burned
it
on
the
hearth
,
powdering
the
very
ashes
with
her
fingers
,
and
dispersing
the
fragments
of
fluttering
black
films
among
the
cinders
of
the
grate
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
breathed
again
.
  
<EOS>
Her
head
ached
with
dizzying
violence
;
she
must
get
quit
of
the
pain
or
it
would
incapacitate
her
for
thinking
and
planning
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
for
food
,
but
there
was
nothing
but
a
little
raw
oatmeal
in
the
house
:
<EOS>
still
,
although
it
almost
choked
her
,
she
ate
some
of
this
,
knowing
from
experience
,
how
often
headaches
were
caused
by
long
fasting
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
sought
for
some
water
to
bathe
her
throbbing
temples
,
and
quench
her
feverish
thirst
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
none
in
the
house
,
so
she
took
the
jug
and
went
out
to
the
pump
at
the
other
end
of
the
court
,
whose
echoes
resounded
her
light
footsteps
in
the
quiet
stillness
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
hard
,
square
outlines
of
the
houses
cut
sharply
against
the
cold
bright
sky
,
from
which
myriads
of
stars
were
shining
down
in
eternal
repose
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
little
sympathy
in
the
outward
scene
,
with
the
internal
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
All
was
so
still
,
so
motionless
,
so
hard
!
 
<EOS>
Very
different
to
this
lovely
night
in
the
country
in
which
I
am
now
writing
,
where
the
distant
horizon
is
soft
and
undulating
in
the
moonlight
,
and
the
nearer
trees
sway
gently
to
and
fro
in
the
night
-
wind
with
something
of
almost
human
motion
;
and
the
rustling
air
makes
music
among
their
branches
,
as
if
speaking
soothingly
to
the
weary
ones
who
lie
awake
in
heaviness
of
heart
.
 
<EOS>
The
sights
and
sounds
of
such
a
night
lull
pain
and
grief
to
rest
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mary
re
-
entered
her
home
after
she
had
filled
her
pitcher
,
with
a
still
stronger
sense
of
anxiety
,
and
a
still
clearer
conviction
of
how
much
rested
upon
her
unassisted
and
friendless
self
,
alone
with
her
terrible
knowledge
,
in
the
hard
,
cold
,
populous
world
.
  
<EOS>
She
bathed
her
forehead
,
and
quenched
her
thirst
,
and
then
,
with
wise
deliberation
of
purpose
,
went
upstairs
,
and
undressed
herself
,
as
if
for
a
long
night
's
slumber
,
although
so
few
hours
intervened
before
day
-
dawn
.
 
<EOS>
She
believed
she
never
could
sleep
,
but
she
lay
down
,
and
shut
her
eyes
;
and
before
many
minutes
she
was
in
as
deep
and
sound
a
slumber
as
if
there
was
no
sin
or
sorrow
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
She
woke
up
,
as
it
was
natural
,
much
refreshed
in
body
;
but
with
a
consciousness
of
some
great
impending
calamity
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
up
in
bed
to
recollect
,
and
when
she
did
remember
,
she
sank
down
again
with
all
the
helplessness
of
despair
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
only
the
weakness
of
an
instant
;
for
were
not
the
very
minutes
precious
,
for
deliberation
if
not
for
action
?
  
<EOS>
Before
she
had
finished
the
necessary
morning
business
of
dressing
,
and
setting
her
house
in
some
kind
of
order
,
she
had
disentangled
her
ravelled
ideas
,
and
arranged
some
kind
of
a
plan
for
action
.
 
<EOS>
If
Jem
was
innocent
(
and
now
of
his
guilt
,
even
his
slightest
participation
in
,
or
knowledge
of
,
the
murder
,
she
acquitted
him
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
)
,
he
must
have
been
somewhere
else
when
the
crime
was
committed
;
probably
with
some
others
,
who
might
bear
witness
to
the
fact
,
if
she
only
knew
where
to
find
them
.
<EOS>
Everything
rested
on
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
heard
of
an
alibi
,
and
believed
it
might
mean
the
deliverance
she
wished
to
accomplish
;
but
she
was
not
quite
sure
,
and
determined
to
apply
to
Job
,
as
one
of
the
few
among
her
acquaintance
gifted
with
the
knowledge
of
hard
words
,
for
to
her
,
all
terms
of
law
,
or
natural
history
,
were
alike
many
-
syllabled
mysteries
.
  
<EOS>
No
time
was
to
be
lost
.
 
<EOS>
She
went
straight
to
<EOS>
Job
Legh
's
house
,
and
found
the
old
man
and
his
grand
-
daughter
sitting
at
breakfast
;
as
she
opened
the
door
she
heard
their
voices
speaking
in
a
grave
,
hushed
,
subdued
tone
,
as
if
something
grieved
their
hearts
.
 
<EOS>
They
stopped
talking
on
her
entrance
,
and
then
she
knew
they
had
been
conversing
about
the
murder
;
about
Jem
's
probable
guilt
;
and
(
it
flashed
upon
her
for
the
first
time
)
on
the
new
light
they
would
have
obtained
regarding
herself
:
<EOS>
for
until
now
they
had
never
heard
of
her
giddy
flirting
with
Mr.
Carson
;
not
in
all
her
confidential
talk
with
Margaret
had
she
ever
spoken
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
Margaret
would
hear
her
conduct
talked
of
by
all
,
as
that
of
a
bold
,
bad
girl
;
and
even
if
she
did
not
believe
everything
that
was
said
,
she
could
hardly
help
feeling
wounded
,
and
disappointed
in
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
So
it
was
in
a
timid
voice
that
Mary
wished
her
usual
good
-
morrow
,
and
her
heart
sunk
within
her
a
little
,
when
Job
,
with
a
form
of
civility
,
bade
her
welcome
in
that
dwelling
,
where
,
until
now
,
she
had
been
too
well
assured
to
require
to
be
asked
to
sit
down
.
  
<EOS>
She
took
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
continued
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
come
to
speak
to
you
about
this
 
about
Jem
Wilson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
bad
business
,
I
'm
afeard
,
"
replied
Job
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
it
's
bad
enough
anyhow
.
 
<EOS>
But
Jem
's
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
he
is
;
I
'm
as
sure
as
sure
can
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
know
,
wench
?
 
<EOS>
Facts
bear
strong
again
him
,
poor
fellow
,
though
he
'd
a
deal
to
put
him
up
,
and
aggravate
him
,
they
say
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
poor
lad
<EOS>
,
he
's
done
for
himself
,
I
'm
afeard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Job
,
"
said
Mary
,
rising
from
her
chair
in
her
eagerness
<EOS>
,
"
you
must
not
say
he
did
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
n't
;
I
'm
sure
and
certain
<EOS>
he
did
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
why
do
you
shake
your
head
?
 
<EOS>
Who
is
to
believe
me
,
 
who
is
to
think
him
innocent
,
if
you
,
who
know'd
him
<EOS>
so
well
,
stick
to
it
<EOS>
he
's
guilty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
loth
enough
to
do
it
,
lass
,
"
<EOS>
replied
Job
<EOS>
;
"
but
I
think
he
's
been
ill
-
used
,
and
 
jilted
(
that
's
plain
truth
,
Mary
,
bare
as
it
may
seem
)
,
and
his
blood
has
been
up
 
many
<EOS>
a
man
has
done
the
like
afore
,
from
like
causes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
O
God
!
 
<EOS>
Then
you
wo
n't
help
me
,
Job
,
to
prove
him
innocent
?
 
<EOS>
O
Job
,
Job
!
<EOS>
believe
me
,
Jem
never
did
harm
to
no
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
afore
;
 
and
mind
,
<EOS>
wench
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
over
-
blame
him
for
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
Job
relapsed
into
silence
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
thought
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Job
,
you
'll
not
refuse
me
this
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
mind
what
you
think
,
if
you
'll
help
me
as
if
he
was
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
Now
suppose
I
know
 
<EOS>
I
knew
,
he
was
innocent
,
 
<EOS>
it
's
only
supposing
,
Job
,
 
<EOS>
what
must
I
do
to
prove
it
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
Job
!
 
<EOS>
Is
n't
it
called
an
alibi
,
the
getting
folk
to
swear
to
where
he
really
was
at
the
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Best
way
,
if
you
know'd
<EOS>
him
innocent
,
would
be
to
find
out
the
real
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
Some
one
did
it
,
that
's
clear
enough
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
was
n't
Jem
who
was
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
tell
?
"
answered
Mary
,
in
agony
of
terror
,
lest
Job
's
question
was
prompted
by
any
suspicion
of
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
was
far
enough
from
any
such
thought
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
had
no
doubt
in
his
own
mind
that
Jem
had
,
in
some
passionate
moment
,
urged
on
by
slighted
love
and
jealousy
,
been
the
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
was
strongly
inclined
to
believe
,
that
Mary
was
aware
of
this
,
only
that
,
too
late
repentant
of
her
light
conduct
which
had
led
to
such
fatal
consequences
,
she
was
now
most
anxious
to
save
her
old
playfellow
,
her
early
friend
,
from
the
doom
awaiting
the
shedder
of
blood
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
Jem
's
not
done
it
,
I
do
n't
see
as
any
on
us
can
tell
who
did
it
.
<EOS>
We
might
find
out
something
if
we
'd
time
;
but
they
say
he
's
to
be
tried
on
Tuesday
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
no
use
hiding
it
,
Mary
<EOS>
;
things
looks
strong
against
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
they
do
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
they
do
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
O
Job
!
<EOS>
is
n't
an
alibi
a
proving
where
he
really
was
at
th
'
time
of
the
murder
;
and
how
must
I
set
about
an
alibi
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
An
alibi
is
that
,
sure
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
thought
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
mun
ask
his
mother
his
doings
,
and
his
whereabouts
that
night
;
the
knowledge
of
that
will
guide
you
a
bit
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
he
was
anxious
that
on
another
should
fall
the
task
of
enlightening
Mary
on
the
hopelessness
of
the
case
,
and
he
felt
that
her
own
sense
would
be
more
convinced
by
inquiry
and
examination
than
any
mere
assertion
of
his
.
  
<EOS>
Margaret
had
sat
silent
and
grave
all
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
To
tell
the
truth
,
she
was
surprised
and
disappointed
by
the
disclosure
of
Mary
's
conduct
,
with
regard
to
Mr.
Henry
Carson
.
 
<EOS>
Gentle
,
reserved
,
and
prudent
herself
,
never
exposed
to
the
trial
of
being
admired
for
her
personal
appearance
,
and
unsusceptible
enough
to
be
in
doubt
even
yet
,
whether
the
fluttering
,
tender
,
infinitely
joyous
feeling
she
was
for
the
first
time
experiencing
,
at
sight
or
sound
,
or
thought
of
Will
Wilson
,
was
love
or
not
,
 
Margaret
had
no
sympathy
with
the
temptations
to
which
loveliness
,
vanity
,
ambition
,
or
the
desire
of
being
admired
,
exposes
so
many
;
no
sympathy
with
flirting
girls
,
in
short
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
she
had
no
idea
of
the
strength
of
the
conflict
between
will
and
principle
in
some
who
were
differently
constituted
from
herself
.
 
<EOS>
With
her
,
to
be
convinced
that
an
action
was
wrong
,
was
tantamount
to
a
determination
not
to
do
so
again
;
and
she
had
little
or
no
difficulty
in
carrying
out
her
determination
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
could
not
understand
how
it
was
that
Mary
had
acted
wrongly
,
and
had
felt
too
much
ashamed
,
in
spite
of
internal
sophistry
,
to
speak
of
her
actions
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
considered
herself
deceived
;
felt
aggrieved
;
and
,
at
the
time
of
which
I
am
now
telling
you
,
was
strongly
inclined
to
give
Mary
up
altogether
,
as
a
girl
devoid
of
the
modest
proprieties
of
her
sex
,
and
capable
of
gross
duplicity
,
in
speaking
of
one
lover
as
she
had
done
of
Jem
,
while
she
was
encouraging
another
in
attentions
,
at
best
of
a
very
doubtful
character
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
Margaret
was
drawn
into
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
it
flashed
across
Mary
's
mind
,
that
the
night
of
the
murder
was
the
very
night
,
or
rather
the
same
early
morning
,
that
Margaret
had
been
with
Alice
.
 
<EOS>
She
turned
sharp
round
,
with
   
"
<EOS>
O
Margaret
,
you
can
tell
me
;
you
were
there
when
he
came
back
that
night
;
were
you
not
?
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
you
were
not
;
but
you
were
there
not
many
hours
after
.
 
<EOS>
Did
not
you
hear
where
he
'd
been
?
 
<EOS>
He
was
away
the
night
before
,
too
,
when
Alice
was
first
taken
;
when
you
were
there
for
your
tea
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
where
was
he
,
Margaret
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
she
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
<EOS>
I
do
remember
something
about
his
keeping
Will
company
,
in
his
walk
to
Liverpool
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
justly
say
what
it
was
,
so
much
happened
that
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
to
his
mother
's
,
"
said
Mary
resolutely
.
  
<EOS>
They
neither
of
them
spoke
,
either
to
advise
or
dissuade
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
felt
she
had
no
sympathy
from
them
,
and
braced
up
her
soul
to
act
without
such
loving
aid
of
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
that
their
advice
would
be
willingly
given
at
her
demand
,
and
that
was
all
she
really
required
for
Jem
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
Still
her
courage
failed
a
little
as
she
walked
to
Jane
Wilson
's
,
alone
in
the
world
with
her
secret
.
  
<EOS>
Jane
Wilson
's
eyes
were
swelled
with
crying
;
and
it
was
sad
to
see
the
ravages
which
intense
anxiety
and
sorrow
had
made
on
her
appearance
in
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
.
 
<EOS>
All
night
long
she
and
Mrs.
Davenport
had
crooned
over
their
sorrows
,
always
recurring
,
like
the
burden
of
an
old
song
,
to
the
dreadest
sorrow
of
all
,
which
was
now
impending
over
Mrs.
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
grown
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
what
word
to
use
 
<EOS>
but
,
something
like
proud
of
her
martyrdom
;
she
had
grown
to
hug
her
grief
;
to
feel
an
excitement
in
her
agony
of
anxiety
about
her
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
,
Mary
,
you
're
here
!
 
<EOS>
O
Mary
,
lass
!
 
<EOS>
He
's
to
be
tried
on
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
fell
to
sobbing
,
in
the
convulsive
breath
-
catching
manner
which
tells
of
so
much
previous
weeping
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
Mrs.
Wilson
,
do
n't
take
on
so
!
 
<EOS>
We
'll
get
him
off
,
you
'll
see
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
fret
;
they
ca
n't
prove
him
guilty
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
tell
thee
they
will
,
"
interrupted
Mrs.
Wilson
,
half
-
irritated
at
the
light
way
,
as
she
considered
it
,
in
which
Mary
spoke
;
and
a
little
displeased
that
another
could
hope
when
she
had
almost
brought
herself
to
find
pleasure
in
despair
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
suit
thee
well
,
"
continued
she
,
"
to
make
light
o
'
the
misery
thou
hast
caused
;
but
I
shall
lay
his
death
at
thy
door
,
as
long
as
I
live
,
and
die
<EOS>
I
know
he
will
;
and
all
for
what
he
never
did
 
<EOS>
no
,
he
never
did
;
my
own
blessed
boy
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
too
weak
to
be
angry
long
;
her
wrath
sank
away
to
feeble
sobbing
and
worn
-
out
moans
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
was
most
anxious
to
soothe
her
from
any
violence
of
either
grief
or
anger
;
she
did
so
want
her
to
be
clear
in
her
recollection
;
and
,
besides
,
her
tenderness
was
great
towards
Jem
's
mother
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
spoke
in
a
low
gentle
tone
the
loving
sentences
,
which
sound
so
broken
and
powerless
in
repetition
,
and
which
yet
have
so
much
power
when
accompanied
with
caressing
looks
and
actions
,
fresh
from
the
heart
;
and
the
old
woman
insensibly
gave
herself
up
to
the
influence
of
those
sweet
,
loving
blue
eyes
,
those
tears
of
sympathy
,
those
words
of
love
and
hope
,
and
was
lulled
into
a
less
morbid
state
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
dear
Mrs.
Wilson
,
can
you
remember
where
he
said
he
was
going
on
Thursday
night
?
 
<EOS>
He
was
out
when
Alice
was
taken
ill
;
and
he
did
not
come
home
till
early
in
the
morning
,
or
,
to
speak
true
,
in
the
night
:
did
he
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
he
went
out
near
upon
five
;
he
went
out
with
Will
;
he
said
he
were
going
to
set
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
him
a
part
of
the
way
,
for
Will
were
hot
upon
walking
to
Liverpool
,
and
would
n't
hearken
to
Jem
's
offer
of
lending
him
five
shillings
for
his
fare
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
two
lads
set
off
together
.
<EOS>
I
mind
it
all
now
:
but
,
thou
seest
,
Alice
's
illness
,
and
this
business
of
poor
Jem
's
,
drove
it
out
of
my
head
;
they
went
off
together
,
to
walk
to
Liverpool
<EOS>
;
that
's
to
say
,
Jem
were
to
go
a
part
o
<EOS>
'
th
'
way
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
who
knows
"
(
falling
back
into
the
old
desponding
tone
)
<EOS>
"
if
he
really
went
?
 
<EOS>
He
might
be
led
off
on
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
O
Mary
,
wench
!
<EOS>
they
'll
hang
him
for
what
he
's
never
done
.
"
     
<EOS>
"
No
they
wo
n't
,
they
sha
n't
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
my
way
a
bit
now
.
 
<EOS>
We
mun
get
Will
to
help
;
there
'll
be
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
swear
that
Jem
were
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Where
is
Jem
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Folk
said
he
were
taken
to
Kirkdale
,
i
'
th
'
prison
van
this
morning
,
without
my
seeing
him
,
poor
chap
!
 
<EOS>
O
wench
!
<EOS>
but
they
've
hurried
on
the
business
at
a
cruel
rate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
they
've
not
let
grass
grow
under
their
feet
,
in
hunting
out
the
man
that
did
it
,
"
said
Mary
sorrowfully
and
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
keep
up
your
heart
.
 
<EOS>
They
got
on
the
wrong
scent
when
they
took
to
suspecting
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afeard
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
see
it
will
end
right
for
Jem
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
mind
it
less
if
I
could
do
aught
,
"
said
Jane
Wilson
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
'm
such
a
poor
weak
old
body
,
and
my
head
's
so
gone
,
and
I
'm
so
dazed
<EOS>
like
,
what
with
Alice
and
all
,
that
I
think
and
think
,
and
can
do
nought
to
help
my
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
might
ha
'
gone
and
seen
him
last
night
,
they
tell
me
now
,
and
then
I
missed
it
.
 
<EOS>
O
Mary
,
I
missed
it
;
and
I
may
never
see
the
lad
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
so
piteously
in
Mary
's
face
with
her
miserable
eyes
,
that
Mary
felt
her
heart
giving
way
,
and
,
dreading
the
weakness
of
her
powers
,
which
the
burst
of
crying
she
longed
for
<EOS>
would
occasion
,
hastily
changed
the
subject
to
Alice
;
and
Jane
<EOS>
,
in
her
heart
,
feeling
that
there
was
no
sorrow
like
a
mother
's
sorrow
,
replied
   
"
<EOS>
She
keeps
on
much
the
same
,
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
happy
,
for
she
knows
nothing
of
what
's
going
on
;
but
th
'
doctor
says
she
grows
weaker
and
weaker
.
 
<EOS>
Thou'lt
maybe
like
to
see
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
went
upstairs
;
partly
because
it
is
the
etiquette
in
humble
life
to
offer
to
friends
a
last
opportunity
of
seeing
the
dying
or
the
dead
,
while
the
same
etiquette
forbids
a
refusal
of
the
invitation
;
and
partly
because
she
longed
to
breathe
,
for
an
instant
,
the
atmosphere
of
holy
calm
,
which
seemed
ever
to
surround
the
pious
,
good
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
lay
,
as
before
,
without
pain
,
or
at
least
any
outward
expression
of
it
;
but
totally
unconscious
of
all
present
circumstances
,
and
absorbed
in
recollections
of
the
days
of
her
girlhood
,
which
were
vivid
enough
to
take
the
place
of
reality
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Still
she
talked
of
green
fields
,
and
still
she
spoke
to
the
long
-
dead
mother
and
sister
,
low
-
lying
in
their
graves
this
many
a
year
,
as
if
they
were
with
her
and
about
her
,
in
the
pleasant
places
where
her
youth
had
passed
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
voice
was
fainter
,
the
motions
were
more
languid
;
she
was
evidently
passing
away
;
but
HOW
happily
!
  
<EOS>
Mary
stood
for
a
time
in
silence
,
watching
and
listening
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
bent
down
and
reverently
kissed
Alice
's
cheek
;
and
drawing
Jane
Wilson
away
from
the
bed
,
as
if
the
spirit
of
her
who
lay
there
were
yet
cognisant
of
present
realities
,
she
whispered
a
few
words
of
hope
to
the
poor
mother
,
and
kissing
her
over
and
over
again
in
a
warm
,
loving
manner
,
she
bade
her
good
-
bye
,
went
a
few
steps
,
and
then
once
more
came
back
to
bid
her
keep
up
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
And
when
she
had
fairly
left
the
house
,
Jane
Wilson
felt
as
if
a
sunbeam
had
ceased
shining
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
sorely
Mary
's
heart
ached
;
for
more
and
more
the
fell
certainty
came
on
her
that
her
father
was
the
murderer
!
 
<EOS>
She
struggled
hard
not
to
dwell
on
this
conviction
;
to
think
alone
on
the
means
of
proving
Jem
's
innocence
;
that
was
her
first
duty
,
and
that
should
be
done
.
   
<EOS>
THE
SUB
-
POENA
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
must
it
then
depend
on
this
poor
eye
<EOS>
And
this
unsteady
hand
,
whether
the
bark
,
That
bears
my
all
of
treasured
hope
and
love
,
Shall
find
a
passage
through
these
frowning
rocks
To
some
fair
port
where
peace
and
safety
smile
,
 
Or
whether
it
shall
blindly
dash
against
them
,
And
miserably
sink
?
<EOS>
Heaven
be
my
help
;
And
clear
my
eye
and
nerve
my
trembling
hand
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
THE
CONSTANT
WOMAN
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
heart
beating
,
her
head
full
of
ideas
,
which
required
time
and
solitude
to
be
reduced
into
order
,
Mary
hurried
home
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
like
one
who
finds
a
jewel
of
which
he
can
not
all
at
once
ascertain
the
value
,
but
who
hides
his
treasure
until
some
quiet
hour
when
he
may
ponder
over
the
capabilities
its
possession
unfolds
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
like
one
who
discovers
the
silken
clue
which
guides
to
some
bower
of
bliss
,
and
secure
of
the
power
within
his
grasp
,
has
to
wait
for
a
time
before
he
may
thread
the
labyrinth
.
  
<EOS>
But
no
jewel
,
no
bower
of
bliss
was
ever
so
precious
to
miser
or
lover
as
was
the
belief
which
now
pervaded
Mary
's
mind
that
Jem
's
innocence
might
be
proved
,
without
involving
any
suspicion
of
that
other
 
<EOS>
that
dear
one
,
so
dear
,
although
so
criminal
 
on
whose
part
in
this
cruel
business
she
dared
not
dwell
even
in
thought
.
 
<EOS>
For
if
she
did
there
arose
the
awful
question
,
 
if
all
went
against
Jem
<EOS>
the
innocent
,
if
judge
and
jury
gave
the
verdict
forth
which
had
the
looming
gallows
in
the
rear
,
what
ought
she
to
do
,
possessed
of
her
terrible
knowledge
?
 
<EOS>
Surely
not
to
inculpate
her
father
 
and
<EOS>
yet
 
<EOS>
and
yet
 
she
almost
prayed
for
the
blessed
unconsciousness
of
death
or
madness
,
rather
than
that
awful
question
should
have
to
be
answered
by
her
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
a
way
seemed
opening
,
opening
yet
more
clear
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
thankful
she
had
thought
of
the
alibi
,
and
yet
more
thankful
to
have
so
easily
obtained
the
clue
to
Jem
's
whereabouts
that
miserable
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
bright
light
that
her
new
hope
threw
over
all
seemed
also
to
make
her
thankful
for
the
early
time
appointed
for
the
trial
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
easy
to
catch
Will
Wilson
on
his
return
from
the
Isle
of
Man
,
which
he
had
planned
<EOS>
should
be
on
the
Monday
;
and
on
the
Tuesday
all
would
be
made
clear
 
all
that
she
dared
to
wish
to
be
made
clear
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
still
to
collect
her
thoughts
and
freshen
her
memory
enough
to
arrange
how
to
meet
with
Will
 
for
to
the
chances
of
a
letter
she
would
not
trust
;
to
find
out
his
lodgings
when
in
Liverpool
;
to
try
and
remember
the
name
of
the
ship
in
which
he
was
to
sail
:
and
the
more
she
considered
these
points
,
the
more
difficulty
she
found
there
would
be
in
ascertaining
these
minor
but
important
facts
.
 
<EOS>
For
you
are
aware
that
Alice
,
whose
memory
was
clear
and
strong
on
all
points
in
which
her
heart
was
interested
,
was
lying
in
a
manner
senseless
:
<EOS>
that
Jane
Wilson
was
(
to
use
her
own
word
,
so
expressive
to
a
Lancashire
ear
)
"
dazed
"
;
that
is
to
say
,
bewildered
,
lost
in
the
confusion
of
terrifying
and
distressing
thoughts
;
incapable
of
concentrating
her
mind
;
and
at
the
best
of
times
Will
's
proceedings
were
a
matter
of
little
importance
to
her
(
or
so
she
pretended
)
,
she
was
so
jealous
of
aught
which
distracted
attention
from
her
pearl
of
price
,
her
only
son
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
So
Mary
felt
hopeless
of
obtaining
any
intelligence
of
the
sailor
's
arrangements
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
should
she
apply
to
Jem
himself
?
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
she
knew
him
too
well
.
<EOS>
She
felt
how
thoroughly
he
must
ere
now
have
had
it
in
his
power
to
exculpate
himself
at
another
's
expense
.
 
<EOS>
And
his
tacit
refusal
so
to
do
,
had
assured
her
of
what
she
had
never
doubted
,
that
the
murderer
was
safe
from
any
impeachment
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
neither
would
he
consent
,
she
feared
,
to
any
steps
which
might
tend
to
prove
himself
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
she
could
not
consult
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
removed
to
Kirkdale
,
and
time
pressed
.
 
<EOS>
Already
it
was
Saturday
at
noon
.
<EOS>
And
even
if
she
could
have
gone
to
him
,
I
believe
she
would
not
.
<EOS>
She
longed
to
do
all
herself
;
to
be
his
liberator
,
his
deliverer
;
to
win
him
life
,
though
she
might
never
regain
his
lost
love
by
her
own
exertions
!
 
<EOS>
And
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
could
she
see
him
to
discuss
a
subject
in
which
both
knew
who
was
the
bloodstained
man
;
and
yet
whose
name
might
not
be
breathed
by
either
,
so
dearly
with
all
his
faults
,
his
sins
,
was
he
loved
by
both
.
  
<EOS>
All
at
once
,
when
she
had
ceased
to
try
and
remember
,
the
name
of
Will
's
ship
flashed
across
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
The
John
Cropper
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
named
it
<EOS>
,
she
had
been
sure
,
all
along
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
named
it
in
his
conversation
with
her
that
last
,
that
fatal
Thursday
evening
.
<EOS>
She
repeated
it
over
and
over
again
,
through
a
nervous
dread
of
again
forgetting
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
John
Cropper
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
,
as
if
she
were
rousing
herself
out
of
some
strange
stupor
,
she
bethought
her
of
Margaret
.
 
<EOS>
Who
so
likely
as
Margaret
to
treasure
<EOS>
every
little
particular
respecting
Will
,
now
Alice
was
dead
to
all
the
stirring
purposes
of
life
?
  
<EOS>
She
had
gone
thus
far
in
her
process
of
thought
,
when
a
neighbour
stepped
in
;
she
with
whom
they
had
usually
deposited
the
house
-
key
,
when
both
Mary
and
her
father
were
absent
from
home
,
and
who
consequently
took
upon
herself
to
answer
all
inquiries
,
and
receive
all
messages
which
any
friends
might
make
,
or
leave
,
on
finding
the
house
shut
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
somewhat
for
you
,
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
A
policeman
left
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
bit
of
parchment
.
  
<EOS>
Many
people
have
a
dread
of
those
mysterious
pieces
of
parchment
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
one
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
was
another
.
 
<EOS>
Her
heart
misgave
her
as
she
took
it
,
and
looked
at
the
unusual
appearance
of
the
writing
,
which
,
though
legible
enough
,
conveyed
no
idea
to
her
,
or
rather
her
mind
shut
itself
up
against
receiving
any
idea
,
which
after
all
was
rather
a
proof
she
had
some
suspicion
of
the
meaning
that
awaited
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
asked
she
,
in
a
voice
from
which
all
the
pith
and
marrow
seemed
extracted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
!
<EOS>
how
should
I
know
?
 
<EOS>
Policeman
said
he
'd
call
again
towards
evening
,
and
see
if
you
'd
getten
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
were
loth
to
leave
it
,
though
I
telled
him
who
I
was
,
and
all
about
my
keeping
th
'
key
,
and
taking
messages
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
about
?
"
asked
Mary
again
,
in
the
same
hoarse
,
feeble
voice
,
and
turning
it
over
in
her
fingers
,
as
if
she
dreaded
to
inform
herself
of
its
meaning
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
yo
can
read
word
of
writing
and
I
can
not
,
so
it
's
queer
I
should
have
to
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
master
says
it
's
a
summons
for
yo
to
bear
witness
again
Jem
Wilson
,
at
th
'
trial
at
Liverpool
Assize
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
God
pity
me
!
"
said
Mary
faintly
,
as
white
as
a
sheet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
wench
,
never
take
on
so
.
 
<EOS>
What
yo
can
say
will
go
little
way
either
to
help
or
to
hinder
,
for
folk
say
he
's
certain
to
be
hung
;
and
sure
enough
,
it
was
t'other
one
as
was
your
sweetheart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
was
beyond
any
pang
<EOS>
this
speech
would
have
given
at
another
time
.
 
<EOS>
Her
thoughts
were
all
busy
picturing
to
herself
the
terrible
occasion
of
their
next
meeting
 
not
as
lovers
meet
should
they
meet
!
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
the
neighbour
,
seeing
no
use
in
remaining
with
one
who
noticed
her
words
or
her
presence
so
little
,
<EOS>
"
thou'lt
tell
<EOS>
policeman
thou'st
getten
his
precious
bit
of
paper
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
think
I
should
be
keeping
it
for
mysel
;
he
's
the
first
as
has
ever
misdoubted
me
about
giving
messages
,
or
notes
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
left
the
house
,
but
Mary
did
not
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
still
with
the
parchment
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
All
at
once
she
started
up
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
take
it
to
Job
Legh
and
ask
him
to
tell
her
the
true
meaning
,
for
it
could
not
be
THAT
.
  
<EOS>
So
she
went
,
and
choked
out
her
words
of
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
sub
-
poena
,
"
he
replied
,
turning
the
parchment
over
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
;
for
Job
loved
hard
words
,
and
lawyer
-
like
forms
,
and
even
esteemed
himself
slightly
qualified
for
a
lawyer
,
from
the
smattering
of
knowledge
he
had
picked
up
from
an
odd
volume
of
Blackstone
that
he
had
once
purchased
at
a
bookstall
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
sub
-
poena
 
<EOS>
what
is
that
?
<EOS>
"
gasped
Mary
,
still
in
suspense
.
  
<EOS>
Job
was
struck
with
her
voice
,
her
changed
miserable
voice
,
and
peered
at
her
countenance
from
over
his
spectacles
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
sub
-
poena
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
this
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
summonsing
you
to
attend
,
and
answer
such
questions
as
may
be
asked
of
you
regarding
the
trial
of
James
Wilson
,
for
the
murder
of
Henry
Carson
;
that
's
the
long
and
short
of
it
,
only
more
elegantly
put
,
for
the
benefit
of
them
who
knows
how
to
value
the
gift
of
language
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
a
witness
beforetime
myself
;
there
's
nothing
much
to
be
afeard
on
;
if
they
are
impudent
,
why
,
just
you
be
impudent
,
and
give
'em
tit
for
tat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
much
to
be
afeard
on
!
"
echoed
Mary
,
but
in
such
a
different
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
poor
wench
,
I
see
how
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
It
'll
go
hard
with
thee
a
bit
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
;
but
keep
up
thy
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Yo
can
not
have
much
to
tell
'em
<EOS>
,
that
can
go
either
one
way
<EOS>
or
th
'
other
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
!
<EOS>
maybe
thou
may
do
him
a
bit
o
'
<EOS>
good
,
for
when
they
set
eyes
on
thee
,
they
'll
see
fast
enough
how
he
came
<EOS>
to
be
so
led
away
by
jealousy
;
for
thou'rt
a
pretty
creature
,
Mary
,
and
one
look
at
thy
face
will
let
'em
into
th
'
secret
of
a
young
man
's
madness
,
and
make
'em
more
ready
to
pass
it
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
O
Job
,
and
wo
n't
you
ever
believe
me
when
I
tell
you
he
's
innocent
?
<EOS>
Indeed
,
and
indeed
I
can
prove
it
;
he
was
with
Will
all
that
night
;
he
was
,
indeed
,
Job
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
wench
!
<EOS>
whose
word
hast
thou
for
that
?
"
said
Job
pityingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
!
<EOS>
his
mother
told
me
,
and
I
'll
get
Will
to
bear
witness
to
it
.
<EOS>
But
,
oh
!
Job
"
<EOS>
(
bursting
into
tears
)
,
"
it
is
hard
if
you
wo
n't
believe
me
.
 
<EOS>
How
shall
I
clear
him
to
strangers
,
when
those
who
know
him
,
and
ought
to
love
him
,
are
so
set
against
his
being
innocent
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
knows
,
I
'm
not
against
his
being
innocent
,
"
said
Job
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
give
half
my
remaining
days
on
earth
 
<EOS>
I
'd
give
them
all
<EOS>
,
Mary
(
and
but
for
the
love
I
bear
to
my
poor
blind
girl
,
they
'd
be
no
great
gift
)
,
if
I
could
save
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
've
thought
me
hard
,
Mary
,
but
I
'm
not
hard
at
bottom
,
and
I
'll
help
you
if
I
can
;
that
I
will
,
right
or
wrong
,
"
he
added
;
but
in
a
low
voice
,
and
coughed
the
uncertain
words
away
the
moment
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
Job
!
<EOS>
if
you
will
help
me
,
"
exclaimed
Mary
,
brightening
up
(
though
it
was
but
a
wintry
gleam
after
all
)
,
"
tell
me
what
to
say
,
when
they
question
me
;
I
shall
be
so
gloppened
,
*
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
know
what
to
answer

<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
Thou
canst
do
nought
better
than
tell
the
truth

<EOS>
Truth
's
best
at
all
times
,
they
say
;
and
for
sure
it
is
when
folk
have
to
do
with
lawyers
;
for
they
're
'
cute
and
cunning
enough
to
get
it
out
sooner
or
later
,
and
it
makes
folk
look
like
Tom
Noddies
,
when
truth
follows
falsehood
,
against
their
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
know
the
truth
;
I
mean
 
I
ca
n't
say
rightly
what
I
mean
;
but
I
'm
sure
,
if
I
were
pent
up
,
and
stared
at
by
hundreds
of
folk
,
and
asked
ever
so
simple
a
question
,
I
should
be
for
answering
it
wrong
;
if
they
asked
me
if
I
had
seen
you
on
a
Saturday
,
or
a
Tuesday
,
or
any
day
,
I
should
have
clean
forgotten
all
about
it
,
and
say
the
very
thing
I
should
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
do
n't
go
for
to
get
such
notions
into
your
head
;
they
're
what
they
call
"
narvous
,
"
and
talking
on
'em
does
no
good

<EOS>
Here
's
Margaret
!
<EOS>
bless
the
wench
!
 
<EOS>
Look
,
Mary
,
how
well
she
guides
hersel

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Job
fell
to
watching
his
grand
-
daughter
,
as
with
balancing
,
measured
steps
,
timed
almost
as
if
to
music
,
she
made
her
way
across
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
shrank
as
if
from
a
cold
blast
 
shrank
from
Margaret
!
 
<EOS>
The
blind
girl
,
with
her
reserve
,
her
silence
,
seemed
to
be
a
severe
judge
;
she
,
listening
,
would
be
such
a
check
to
the
trusting
earnestness
of
confidence
,
which
was
beginning
to
unlock
the
sympathy
of
Job
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
knew
herself
to
blame
;
felt
her
errors
in
every
fibre
of
her
heart
;
but
yet
she
would
rather
have
had
them
spoken
about
,
even
in
terms
of
severest
censure
,
than
have
been
treated
in
the
icy
manner
in
which
Margaret
had
received
her
that
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
Mary
,
"
said
Job
,
almost
as
if
he
wished
to
propitiate
his
grand
-
daughter
,
"
come
to
take
a
bit
of
dinner
with
us
,
for
I
'll
warrant
she
's
never
thought
of
cooking
any
for
herself
to
-
day
;
and
she
looks
as
wan
and
pale
as
a
ghost
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
calling
out
the
feeling
of
hospitality
,
so
strong
and
warm
in
most
of
those
who
have
little
to
offer
,
but
whose
heart
goes
eagerly
and
kindly
with
that
little
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
came
towards
Mary
with
a
welcoming
gesture
,
and
a
kinder
manner
by
far
than
she
had
used
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Mary
,
thou
know'st
thou'st
getten
naught
at
home
,
"
urged
Job
.
  
<EOS>
And
Mary
,
faint
and
weary
,
and
with
a
heart
too
aching
-
full
of
other
matters
to
be
pertinacious
in
this
,
withdrew
her
refusal
.
  
<EOS>
They
ate
their
dinner
quietly
;
for
to
all
it
was
an
effort
to
speak
:
and
after
one
or
two
attempts
they
had
subsided
into
silence
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
meal
was
ended
<EOS>
Job
began
again
on
the
subject
they
all
had
at
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yon
poor
lad
at
Kirkdale
will
want
a
lawyer
to
see
they
do
n't
put
on
him
,
but
do
him
justice
.
 
<EOS>
Hast
thought
of
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
had
not
,
and
felt
sure
his
mother
had
not
.
  
<EOS>
Margaret
confirmed
this
last
supposition
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
but
just
been
there
,
and
poor
Jane
is
like
one
dateless
;
so
many
griefs
come
on
her
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
One
time
she
seems
to
make
sure
he
'll
be
hung
;
and
if
I
took
her
in
that
way
,
she
flew
out
(
poor
body
!
)
and
said
that
in
spite
of
what
folks
said
,
there
were
them
as
could
,
and
would
prove
him
guiltless
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
never
knew
where
to
have
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
thing
she
was
constant
in
,
was
declaring
him
innocent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
-
like
!
"
said
Job
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
meant
Will
,
when
she
spoke
of
them
that
could
prove
him
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
with
Will
on
Thursday
night
,
walking
a
part
of
the
way
with
him
to
Liverpool
;
now
the
thing
is
to
lay
hold
on
Will
and
get
him
to
prove
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
spoke
Mary
,
calm
,
from
the
earnestness
of
her
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
build
too
much
on
it
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Job
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
build
on
it
,
"
replied
Mary
,
"
because
I
know
it
's
the
truth
,
and
I
mean
to
try
and
prove
it
,
come
what
may
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
you
can
say
will
daunt
me
,
Job
,
so
do
n't
you
go
and
try
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
help
,
but
you
can
not
hinder
me
doing
what
I
'm
resolved
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
respected
her
firmness
of
determination
,
and
Job
almost
gave
in
to
her
belief
,
when
he
saw
how
steadfastly
she
was
acting
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
surest
way
of
conversion
to
our
faith
,
<EOS>
whatever
it
may
be
 
regarding
either
small
things
,
or
great
 
when
it
is
beheld
as
the
actuating
principle
,
from
which
we
never
swerve
!
 
<EOS>
When
it
is
seen
that
,
instead
of
overmuch
profession
,
it
is
worked
into
the
life
,
and
moves
every
action
!
  
<EOS>
Mary
gained
courage
as
she
instinctively
felt
she
had
made
way
with
one
at
least
of
her
companions
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
I
'm
clear
about
this
much
,
"
she
continued
,
"
he
was
with
Will
when
the
 
shot
was
fired
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
say
,
when
the
murder
was
committed
,
when
she
remembered
WHO
it
was
that
,
she
had
every
reason
to
believe
,
was
the
taker
-
away
of
life
)
 
<EOS>
"
Will
can
prove
this
:
I
must
find
Will
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
n't
to
sail
till
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
There
's
time
enough
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
to
come
back
from
his
uncle
's
,
in
the
Isle
of
Man
,
on
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
meet
him
in
Liverpool
,
on
that
day
,
and
tell
him
what
has
happened
,
and
how
poor
Jem
is
in
trouble
,
and
that
he
must
prove
an
alibi
,
come
Tuesday
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
I
can
and
will
do
,
though
perhaps
I
do
n't
clearly
know
<EOS>
how
,
just
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
But
surely
God
will
help
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
know
I
'm
doing
right
,
I
will
have
no
fear
,
but
put
my
trust
in
Him
;
for
I
'm
acting
for
the
innocent
and
good
,
and
not
for
my
own
self
,
who
have
done
so
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
fear
when
I
think
of
Jem
,
who
is
so
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
stopped
,
oppressed
with
the
fulness
of
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
began
to
love
her
again
;
to
see
in
her
the
same
sweet
,
faulty
,
impulsive
,
lovable
creature
she
had
known
in
the
former
Mary
Barton
,
but
with
more
of
dignity
,
self
-
reliance
,
and
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
spoke
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
I
know
the
name
of
Will
's
vessel
 
the
John
Cropper
;
and
I
know
that
she
is
bound
to
America
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
something
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
forgot
,
if
I
ever
heard
,
where
he
lodges
in
Liverpool
.
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
of
his
landlady
,
as
a
good
,
trustworthy
woman
;
but
if
he
named
her
name
,
it
has
slipped
my
memory
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
help
me
,
Margaret
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
appealed
to
her
friend
calmly
and
openly
,
as
if
perfectly
aware
of
,
and
recognising
the
unspoken
tie
which
bound
her
and
Will
together
;
she
asked
her
in
the
same
manner
in
which
she
would
have
asked
a
wife
where
her
husband
dwelt
.
 
<EOS>
And
Margaret
replied
in
the
like
calm
tone
,
two
spots
of
crimson
on
her
cheeks
alone
bearing
witness
to
any
internal
agitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
lodges
at
a
Mrs.
Jones
'
,
Milk
-
House
Yard
,
out
of
Nicholas
Street
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
lodged
there
ever
since
he
began
to
go
to
sea
;
she
is
a
very
decent
kind
of
woman
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
,
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
give
you
my
prayers
"
said
Job
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
often
I
pray
regular
,
though
I
often
speak
a
word
to
God
,
when
I
'm
either
very
happy
or
very
sorry
;
I
've
catched
myself
thanking
Him
at
odd
hours
when
I
've
found
a
rare
insect
,
or
had
a
fine
day
for
an
out
;
but
I
can
not
help
it
,
no
more
than
I
can
talking
to
a
friend
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
time
I
'll
pray
regular
for
Jem
,
and
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
will
Margaret
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
wench
!
<EOS>
what
think
yo
of
a
lawyer
?
<EOS>
I
know
one
,
Mr.
Cheshire
,
who
's
rather
given
to
th
'
insect
line
 
and
a
good
kind
o
'
chap
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
I
have
swopped
<EOS>
specimens
many
's
the
time
,
when
either
of
us
had
a
duplicate
.
 
<EOS>
He
'll
do
me
a
kind
turn
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
just
take
my
hat
,
and
pay
him
a
visit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
No
sooner
said
,
than
done
.
  
<EOS>
Margaret
and
Mary
were
left
alone
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
seemed
to
bring
back
the
feeling
of
awkwardness
,
not
to
say
estrangement
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mary
,
excited
to
an
unusual
pitch
of
courage
,
was
the
first
to
break
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
Margaret
!
<EOS>
"
said
she
,
"
I
see
 
I
feel
how
wrong
you
think
I
have
acted
;
you
can
not
think
me
worse
than
I
think
myself
,
now
my
eyes
are
opened
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
her
sobs
came
choking
up
her
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
Margaret
began
,
"
I
have
no
right
to
"
    
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Margaret
,
you
have
a
right
to
judge
;
you
can
not
help
it
;
only
in
your
judgment
remember
mercy
,
as
the
Bible
says
.
 
<EOS>
You
,
who
have
been
always
good
,
can
not
tell
how
easy
it
is
at
first
to
go
a
little
wrong
,
and
then
how
hard
it
is
to
go
back
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
little
thought
when
I
was
first
pleased
with
Mr.
Carson
's
speeches
<EOS>
,
how
it
would
all
end
;
perhaps
in
the
death
of
him
I
love
better
than
life
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
.
 
<EOS>
The
feelings
pent
up
through
the
day
would
have
vent
.
 
<EOS>
But
checking
herself
with
a
strong
effort
,
and
looking
up
at
Margaret
as
piteously
as
if
those
calm
,
stony
eyes
could
see
her
imploring
face
,
she
added
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
cry
;
I
must
not
give
way
;
there
will
be
time
enough
for
that
hereafter
,
if
 
I
only
wanted
you
to
speak
kindly
to
me
,
Margaret
,
for
I
am
very
,
very
wretched
;
more
wretched
than
any
one
can
ever
know
;
more
wretched
,
I
sometimes
fancy
,
than
I
have
deserved
 
<EOS>
but
that
's
wrong
,
is
n't
it
,
Margaret
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
have
done
wrong
,
and
I
am
punished
:
you
can
not
tell
how
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
Who
could
resist
her
voice
,
her
tones
of
misery
,
of
humility
?
 
<EOS>
Who
would
refuse
the
kindness
for
which
she
begged
so
penitently
?
 
<EOS>
Not
Margaret
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
friendly
manner
came
back
.
 
<EOS>
With
it
,
maybe
,
more
of
tenderness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
Margaret
,
do
you
think
he
can
be
saved
;
do
you
think
they
can
find
him
guilty
,
if
Will
comes
forward
as
a
witness
?
 
<EOS>
Wo
n't
that
be
a
good
alibi
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Margaret
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
speak
!
<EOS>
Margaret
,
"
said
Mary
,
with
anxious
impatience
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nought
about
law
,
or
alibis
,
"
replied
Margaret
meekly
;
"
but
,
Mary
,
as
grandfather
says
,
are
n't
you
building
too
much
on
what
Jane
Wilson
has
told
you
about
his
going
with
Will
?
 
<EOS>
Poor
soul
,
she
's
gone
dateless
,
I
think
,
with
care
,
and
watching
,
and
overmuch
trouble
;
and
who
can
wonder
?
 
<EOS>
Or
Jem
may
have
told
her
he
was
going
,
by
way
of
a
blind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
Jem
,
"
said
Mary
,
starting
from
her
seat
in
a
hurried
manner
,
"
or
you
would
not
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
may
be
wrong
!
<EOS>
but
think
,
Mary
,
how
much
there
is
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
shot
was
fired
with
his
gun
;
he
it
was
as
threatened
Mr.
Carson
not
many
days
before
;
he
was
absent
from
home
at
that
very
time
,
as
we
know
,
and
,
as
I
'm
much
afeard
,
some
one
will
be
called
on
to
prove
;
and
there
's
no
one
else
to
share
suspicion
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
heaved
a
deep
sigh
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
Margaret
,
he
did
not
do
it
,
"
Mary
again
asserted
.
  
<EOS>
Margaret
looked
unconvinced
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
no
good
,
I
see
,
by
saying
so
,
for
none
on
you
believe
me
,
and
I
wo
n't
say
so
again
till
I
can
prove
it
.
 
<EOS>
Monday
morning
I
'll
go
to
Liverpool
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
at
hand
for
the
trial
.
 
<EOS>
O
dear
!
<EOS>
dear
!
<EOS>
And
I
will
find
Will
;
and
then
,
Margaret
,
I
think
you
'll
be
sorry
for
being
so
stubborn
about
Jem
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
fly
off
,
dear
Mary
;
I
'd
give
a
deal
to
be
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
I
'm
going
to
be
plain
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
want
money
.
 
<EOS>
Them
lawyers
is
no
better
than
a
sponge
for
sucking
up
money
;
let
alone
your
hunting
out
Will
,
and
your
keep
in
Liverpool
,
and
what
not
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
take
some
of
the
mint
I
've
got
laid
by
in
the
old
tea
-
pot
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
no
right
to
refuse
,
for
I
offer
it
to
Jem
,
not
to
you
;
it
's
for
his
purposes
you
're
to
use
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
 
I
see
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
Margaret
;
you
're
a
kind
one
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
I
take
it
for
Jem
;
and
I
'll
do
my
very
best
with
it
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Not
all
,
though
;
do
n't
think
I
'll
take
all
.
 
<EOS>
They
'll
pay
me
for
my
keep
.
<EOS>
I
'll
take
this
,
"
accepting
a
sovereign
from
the
hoard
which
Margaret
produced
out
of
its
accustomed
place
in
the
cupboard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
grandfather
will
pay
the
lawyer
,
I
'll
have
nought
to
do
with
him
,
"
shuddering
as
she
remembered
Job
's
words
,
about
lawyers
'
skill
in
always
discovering
the
truth
,
sooner
or
later
;
and
knowing
what
was
the
secret
she
had
to
hide
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
!
<EOS>
do
n't
make
such
ado
about
it
,
"
said
Margaret
,
cutting
short
Mary
's
thanks
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
sometimes
think
there
's
two
sides
to
the
commandment
;
and
that
we
may
say
,
"
Let
others
do
unto
you
,
as
you
would
do
unto
them
,
"
for
pride
often
prevents
our
giving
others
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
,
in
not
letting
them
be
kind
,
when
their
hearts
are
longing
to
help
;
and
<EOS>
when
we
ourselves
should
wish
to
do
just
the
same
,
if
we
were
in
their
place
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
often
I
've
been
hurt
,
by
being
coldly
told
by
persons
not
to
trouble
myself
about
their
care
,
or
sorrow
,
when
I
saw
them
in
great
grief
,
and
wanted
to
be
of
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
Our
Lord
Jesus
was
not
above
letting
folk
minister
to
Him
,
for
He
knew
how
happy
it
makes
one
to
do
aught
for
another
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
happiest
work
on
earth
.

<EOS>
Mary
had
been
too
much
engrossed
by
watching
what
was
passing
in
the
street
to
attend
very
closely
to
that
which
Margaret
was
saying
.
<EOS>
From
her
seat
she
could
see
out
of
the
window
pretty
plainly
,
and
she
caught
sight
of
a
gentleman
walking
alongside
of
Job
,
evidently
in
earnest
conversation
with
him
,
and
looking
keen
and
penetrating
enough
to
be
a
lawyer
.
 
<EOS>
Job
was
laying
down
something
to
be
attended
to
<EOS>
she
could
see
,
by
his
uplifted
forefinger
,
and
his
whole
gesture
;
then
he
pointed
and
nodded
across
the
street
to
his
own
house
,
as
if
inducing
his
companion
to
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
dreaded
lest
he
should
,
and
she
be
subjected
to
a
closer
cross
-
examination
than
she
had
hitherto
undergone
,
as
to
why
she
was
so
certain
that
Jem
was
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
She
feared
he
was
coming
;
he
stepped
a
little
towards
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
it
was
only
to
make
way
for
a
child
,
tottering
along
,
whom
Mary
had
overlooked
.
 
<EOS>
Now
Job
took
him
by
the
button
,
so
earnestly
familiar
had
he
grown
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
looked
"
fidging
fain
"
to
be
gone
,
but
submitted
in
a
manner
that
made
Mary
like
him
in
spite
of
his
profession
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
a
volley
of
last
words
,
answered
by
briefest
nods
,
and
monosyllables
;
and
then
the
stranger
went
off
with
redoubled
quickness
of
pace
,
and
Job
crossed
the
street
with
a
little
satisfied
air
of
importance
on
his
kindly
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Mary
,
"
said
he
on
entering
,
"
I
've
seen
the
lawyer
,
not
Mr.
Cheshire
though
;
trials
for
murder
,
it
seems
,
are
not
his
line
o
'
business
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
gived
me
a
note
to
another
'
torney
;
a
fine
fellow
enough
,
only
too
much
of
a
talker
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
get
a
word
in
<EOS>
,
he
cut
me
so
short
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
've
just
been
going
over
the
principal
points
again
to
him
;
maybe
you
saw
us
!
 
<EOS>
I
wanted
him
just
to
come
over
and
speak
to
you
himsel
,
Mary
,
but
he
was
pressed
for
time
;
and
he
said
your
evidence
would
not
be
much
either
here
or
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
going
to
the
'
sizes
first
train
on
Monday
morning
,
and
will
see
Jem
,
and
hear
the
ins
and
outs
from
him
,
and
he
's
gived
me
his
address
,
Mary
,
and
you
and
<EOS>
Will
are
to
call
on
him
(
Will
'
special
)
on
Monday
at
two
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
Thou'rt
taking
it
in
,
Mary
;
thou'rt
to
call
on
him
in
Liverpool
at
two
,
Monday
afternoon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Job
had
reason
to
doubt
if
she
fully
understood
him
;
for
all
this
minuteness
of
detail
,
these
satisfactory
arrangements
,
as
he
considered
them
,
only
seemed
to
bring
the
circumstances
in
which
she
was
placed
more
vividly
home
to
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
They
convinced
her
that
it
was
real
,
and
not
all
a
dream
,
as
she
had
sunk
into
fancying
it
for
a
few
minutes
,
while
sitting
in
the
old
accustomed
place
,
her
body
enjoying
the
rest
,
and
her
frame
sustained
by
food
,
and
listening
to
Margaret
's
calm
voice
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
she
had
just
beheld
would
see
and
question
Jem
in
a
few
hours
,
and
what
would
be
the
result
?
  
<EOS>
Monday
:
that
was
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
,
and
on
Tuesday
,
life
and
death
would
be
tremendous
realities
to
her
lover
;
or
else
death
would
be
an
awful
certainty
to
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
No
wonder
Job
went
over
his
main
points
again
   
"
Monday
;
at
two
o'clock
,
mind
;
and
here
's
his
card
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bridgnorth
,
41
,
Renshaw
Street
,
Liverpool
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
'll
be
lodging
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Job
ceased
talking
,
and
the
silence
roused
Mary
up
to
thank
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
very
kind
,
Job
;
very
.
 
<EOS>
You
and
Margaret
wo
n't
desert
me
,
come
what
will

<EOS>
"
Pooh

<EOS>
pooh
!
<EOS>
wench
;
do
n't
lose
heart
,
just
as
I
'm
beginning
to
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
seems
to
think
a
deal
on
Will
's
evidence
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
sure
<EOS>
,
girls
,
you
're
under
no
mistake
about
Will
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
he
went
straight
from
here
,
purposing
to
go
to
see
his
uncle
at
the
Isle
of
Man
,
and
be
back
Sunday
night
,
ready
for
the
ship
sailing
on
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
So
am
I
,
"
said
Margaret
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
the
ship
's
name
was
the
John
Cropper
,
and
he
lodged
where
I
told
Mary
before
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
got
it
down
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mary
wrote
it
on
the
back
of
Mr.
Bridgnorth
's
card
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
not
over
-
willing
to
go
,
"
said
she
as
she
wrote
,
"
for
he
knew
little
about
his
uncle
,
and
said
he
did
n't
care
if
he
never
know'd
more
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
said
kinsfolk
was
kinsfolk
,
and
promises
was
promises
,
so
he
'd
go
for
a
day
or
so
,
and
then
it
would
be
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
Margaret
had
to
go
and
practise
some
singing
in
town
;
so
,
though
loth
to
depart
and
be
alone
,
Mary
bade
her
friends
<EOS>
good
-
bye
.
   
<EOS>
WITH
THE
DYING
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sad
and
solemn
is
the
trembling
watch
Of
those
who
sit
and
count
the
heavy
hours
Beside
the
fevered
sleep
of
one
they
love
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
awful
is
it
in
the
hushed
midnight
,
While
gazing
on
the
pallid
moveless
form
,
To
start
and
ask
,
"
Is
it
now
sleep
or
death
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
NONYMOUS
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
could
not
be
patient
in
her
loneliness
;
so
much
painful
thought
weighed
on
her
mind
;
the
very
house
was
haunted
with
memories
and
foreshadowings
.
  
<EOS>
Having
performed
all
duties
to
Jem
,
as
far
as
her
weak
powers
,
yet
loving
heart
could
act
;
and
a
black
veil
being
drawn
over
her
father
's
past
,
present
,
and
future
life
,
beyond
which
she
could
not
penetrate
to
judge
of
any
filial
service
she
ought
to
render
:
her
mind
unconsciously
sought
after
some
course
of
action
in
which
she
might
engage
.
 
<EOS>
Anything
,
anything
,
rather
than
leisure
for
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
came
up
the
old
feeling
which
first
bound
Ruth
to
Naomi
<EOS>
;
the
love
they
both
held
towards
one
object
;
and
Mary
felt
that
her
cares
would
be
most
lightened
by
being
of
use
,
or
of
comfort
to
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
once
more
locked
up
the
house
,
and
set
off
towards
Ancoats
;
rushing
along
with
downcast
head
,
for
fear
lest
anyone
should
recognise
her
and
arrest
her
progress
.
  
<EOS>
Jane
Wilson
sat
quietly
in
her
chair
as
Mary
entered
;
so
quietly
,
as
to
strike
one
by
the
contrast
it
presented
to
her
usual
bustling
and
nervous
manner
.
  
<EOS>
She
looked
very
pale
and
wan
:
but
the
quietness
was
the
thing
that
struck
Mary
most
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
rise
as
Mary
came
in
,
but
sat
still
and
said
something
in
so
gentle
,
so
feeble
a
voice
,
that
Mary
did
not
catch
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davenport
,
who
was
there
,
plucked
Mary
by
the
gown
,
and
whispered
,
"
Never
heed
her
;
she
's
worn
out
,
and
best
let
alone
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
all
about
it
,
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Mary
,
touched
by
the
anxious
look
with
which
Mrs.
Wilson
gazed
at
her
,
as
if
waiting
the
answer
to
some
question
,
went
forward
to
listen
to
the
speech
she
was
again
repeating
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
tell
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Mary
looked
and
saw
another
ominous
slip
of
parchment
in
the
mother
's
hand
,
which
she
was
rolling
up
and
down
in
a
tremulous
manner
between
her
fingers
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
's
heart
sickened
within
her
,
and
she
could
not
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
repeated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
tell
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
still
looked
at
Mary
,
with
the
same
child
-
like
gaze
of
wonder
and
patient
entreaty
.
  
<EOS>
What
could
she
answer
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
telled
ye
not
to
heed
her
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davenport
,
a
little
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
knows
well
enough
what
it
is
 
too
well
,
<EOS>
belike
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
in
when
they
sarved
it
;
but
Mrs.
Heming
(
her
as
lives
next
door
)
was
,
and
she
spelled
out
the
meaning
,
and
made
it
all
clear
to
Mrs.
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
summons
to
be
a
witness
on
Jem
's
trial
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Heming
thinks
to
swear
to
the
gun
;
for
yo
see
,
there
's
nobbut
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
her
as
can
testify
to
its
being
his
,
and
she
let
on
so
easily
to
the
policeman
that
it
was
his
,
that
there
's
no
getting
off
her
word
now
.
<EOS>
Poor
body
;
she
takes
it
very
hard
,
I
dare
say
!
"
     
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilson
had
waited
patiently
while
this
whispered
speech
was
being
uttered
,
imagining
,
perhaps
,
that
it
would
end
in
some
explanation
addressed
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
both
were
silent
,
though
their
eyes
,
without
speech
or
language
,
told
their
hearts
'
pity
,
she
spoke
again
in
the
same
unaltered
gentle
voice
(
so
different
from
the
irritable
impatience
she
had
been
ever
apt
to
show
to
everyone
except
her
husband
 
<EOS>
he
who
had
wedded
her
,
broken
-
down
and
injured
)
,
 
in
a
voice
so
different
,
I
say
,
from
the
old
,
hasty
manner
<EOS>
,
she
spoke
now
the
same
anxious
words
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
tell
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yo'd
better
give
it
me
at
once
,
Mrs.
Wilson
,
and
let
me
put
it
out
of
your
sight
.
 
<EOS>
Speak
to
her
,
Mary
,
wench
,
and
ask
for
a
sight
on
it
<EOS>
;
I
've
tried
and
better
-
tried
to
get
it
from
her
,
and
she
takes
no
heed
of
words
,
and
I
'm
loth
to
pull
it
by
force
out
of
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
drew
the
little
"
cricket
"
*
out
from
under
the
dresser
,
and
sat
down
at
Mrs.
Wilson
's
knee
,
and
,
coaxing
one
of
her
tremulous
ever
-
moving
hands
into
hers
,
began
to
rub
it
soothingly
;
there
was
a
little
resistance
 
a
very
little
,
but
that
was
all
;
and
presently
,
in
the
nervous
movement
of
the
imprisoned
hand
,
the
parchment
fell
to
the
ground
.
     
<EOS>
Mary
calmly
and
openly
picked
it
up
,
without
any
attempt
at
concealment
,
and
quietly
placing
it
in
sight
of
the
anxious
eyes
that
followed
it
with
a
kind
of
spell
-
bound
dread
,
went
on
with
her
soothing
caresses
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
had
no
sleep
for
many
nights
,
"
said
the
girl
to
Mrs.
Davenport
,
"
and
all
this
woe
and
sorrow
,
 
<EOS>
it
's
no
wonder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davenport
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
get
her
fairly
to
bed
;
we
must
get
her
undressed
,
and
all
;
and
trust
to
God
in
His
mercy
to
send
her
to
sleep
,
or
else
<EOS>
"
    
For
,
you
see
,
they
spoke
before
her
as
if
she
were
not
there
;
her
heart
was
so
far
away
.
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
they
almost
lifted
her
from
the
chair
,
in
which
she
sat
motionless
,
and
taking
her
up
as
gently
as
a
mother
carries
her
sleeping
baby
,
they
undressed
her
poor
,
worn
form
,
and
laid
her
in
the
little
bed
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
once
thought
of
placing
her
in
Jem
's
bed
,
to
be
out
of
sight
or
sound
of
any
disturbance
of
Alice
's
;
but
then
again
they
remembered
the
shock
she
might
receive
in
awakening
in
so
unusual
a
place
,
and
also
that
Mary
,
who
intended
to
keep
vigil
that
night
in
the
house
of
mourning
,
would
find
it
difficult
to
divide
her
attention
in
the
possible
cases
that
might
ensue
.
  
<EOS>
So
they
laid
her
,
as
I
said
before
,
on
that
little
pallet
bed
;
and
,
as
they
were
slowly
withdrawing
from
the
bedside
,
hoping
and
praying
that
she
might
sleep
,
and
forget
for
a
time
her
heavy
burden
<EOS>
,
she
looked
wistfully
after
Mary
,
and
whispered
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
told
me
what
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
And
gazing
in
her
face
for
the
expected
answer
,
her
eyelids
slowly
closed
,
and
she
fell
into
a
deep
,
heavy
sleep
,
almost
as
profound
a
rest
as
death
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davenport
went
her
way
,
and
Mary
was
alone
,
 
for
I
can
not
call
those
who
sleep
allies
against
the
agony
of
thought
which
solitude
sometimes
brings
up
.
  
<EOS>
She
dreaded
the
night
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
might
die
;
the
doctor
had
that
day
declared
her
case
hopeless
,
and
not
far
from
death
;
and
at
times
,
the
terror
so
natural
to
the
young
,
not
of
death
,
but
of
the
remains
of
the
dead
,
came
over
Mary
;
and
she
bent
and
listened
anxiously
for
the
long
-
drawn
,
pausing
breath
of
the
sleeping
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
Or
Mrs.
Wilson
might
awake
in
a
state
which
Mary
dreaded
to
anticipate
,
and
anticipated
while
she
dreaded
;
 
in
a
state
of
complete
delirium
.
 
<EOS>
Already
her
senses
had
been
severely
stunned
by
the
full
explanation
of
what
was
required
of
her
 
of
what
she
had
to
prove
against
her
son
,
her
Jem
,
her
only
child
 
<EOS>
which
Mary
could
not
doubt
the
officious
Mrs.
Heming
had
given
;
and
what
if
in
dreams
(
that
land
into
which
no
sympathy
or
love
can
penetrate
with
another
,
either
to
share
its
bliss
or
its
agony
 
<EOS>
that
land
whose
scenes
are
unspeakable
terrors
,
are
hidden
mysteries
,
are
priceless
treasures
to
one
alone
 
that
land
where
alone
<EOS>
I
may
see
,
while
yet
I
tarry
here
,
the
sweet
looks
of
my
dear
child
)
 
<EOS>
what
if
,
in
the
horrors
of
her
dreams
,
her
brain
should
go
still
more
astray
,
and
she
should
waken
crazy
with
her
visions
,
and
the
terrible
reality
that
begot
them
?
  
<EOS>
How
much
worse
is
anticipation
sometimes
than
reality
!
 
<EOS>
How
Mary
dreaded
that
night
,
and
how
calmly
it
passed
by
!
 
<EOS>
Even
more
so
than
if
Mary
had
not
had
such
claims
upon
her
care
!
  
<EOS>
Anxiety
about
them
deadened
her
own
peculiar
anxieties
.
 
<EOS>
She
thought
of
the
sleepers
whom
she
was
watching
,
till
,
overpowered
herself
by
the
want
of
rest
<EOS>
,
she
fell
off
into
short
slumbers
in
which
the
night
wore
imperceptibly
away
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
Alice
spoke
,
and
sang
during
her
waking
moments
,
like
the
child
she
deemed
herself
;
but
so
happily
with
the
dearly
-
loved
ones
around
her
,
with
the
scent
of
the
heather
,
and
the
song
of
the
wild
bird
hovering
about
her
in
imagination
 
with
old
scraps
of
ballads
,
or
old
snatches
of
primitive
versions
of
the
Psalms
(
such
as
are
sung
in
country
churches
half
draperied
over
with
ivy
,
and
where
the
running
brook
,
or
the
murmuring
wind
among
the
trees
makes
fit
accompaniment
to
the
chorus
of
human
voices
uttering
praise
and
thanksgiving
to
their
God
)
 
<EOS>
that
the
speech
and
the
song
gave
comfort
and
good
cheer
to
the
listener
's
heart
,
and
the
grey
dawn
began
to
dim
the
light
of
the
rush
-
candle
,
before
Mary
thought
it
possible
that
day
was
already
trembling
in
the
horizon
.
  
<EOS>
Then
she
got
up
from
the
chair
where
she
had
been
dozing
,
and
went
,
half
-
asleep
,
to
the
window
to
assure
herself
that
morning
was
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
streets
were
unusually
quiet
with
a
Sabbath
stillness
.
<EOS>
No
factory
bells
that
morning
;
no
early
workmen
going
to
their
labours
;
no
slip
-
shod
girls
cleaning
the
windows
of
the
little
shops
which
broke
the
monotony
of
the
street
;
instead
,
you
might
see
here
<EOS>
and
there
some
operative
sallying
forth
for
a
breath
of
country
air
,
or
some
father
leading
out
his
wee
toddling
bairns
for
the
unwonted
pleasure
of
a
walk
with
"
Daddy
,
"
in
the
clear
frosty
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Men
with
more
leisure
on
week
-
days
would
perhaps
have
walked
quicker
than
they
did
through
the
fresh
sharp
air
of
this
Sunday
morning
;
but
to
them
there
was
a
pleasure
,
an
absolute
refreshment
in
the
dawdling
gait
they
,
one
and
all
of
them
,
had
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
,
indeed
,
one
or
two
passengers
on
that
morning
whose
objects
were
less
innocent
and
less
praiseworthy
than
those
of
the
people
I
have
already
mentioned
,
and
whose
animal
state
of
mind
and
body
clashed
jarringly
on
the
peacefulness
of
the
day
,
but
upon
them
I
will
not
dwell
;
as
you
and
I
,
and
almost
every
one
,
I
think
,
may
send
up
our
individual
cry
of
self
-
reproach
that
we
have
not
done
all
that
we
could
for
the
stray
and
wandering
ones
of
our
brethren
.
  
<EOS>
When
Mary
turned
from
the
window
,
she
went
to
the
bed
of
each
sleeper
,
to
look
and
listen
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
looked
perfectly
quiet
and
happy
in
her
slumber
,
and
her
face
seemed
to
have
become
much
more
youthful
during
the
painless
approach
to
death
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilson
's
countenance
was
stamped
with
the
anxiety
of
the
last
few
days
,
although
she
,
too
,
appeared
sleeping
soundly
;
but
as
Mary
gazed
on
her
,
trying
to
trace
a
likeness
to
her
son
in
her
face
,
she
awoke
and
looked
up
into
Mary
's
eyes
,
while
the
expression
of
consciousness
came
back
into
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
Both
were
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
's
eyes
had
fallen
beneath
that
penetrating
gaze
,
in
which
the
agony
of
memory
seemed
every
minute
to
find
fuller
vent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
a
dream
?
"
<EOS>
the
mother
asked
at
last
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
replied
Mary
,
in
the
same
tone
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilson
hid
her
face
in
the
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
fully
conscious
of
everything
this
morning
;
it
was
evident
that
the
stunning
effect
of
the
sub
-
poena
,
which
had
affected
her
so
much
last
night
in
her
weak
,
worn
-
out
state
,
had
passed
away
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
offered
no
opposition
when
she
indicated
by
languid
gesture
and
action
that
she
wished
to
rise
.
 
<EOS>
A
sleepless
bed
is
a
haunted
place
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
was
dressed
with
Mary
's
aid
,
she
stood
by
Alice
for
a
minute
or
two
looking
at
the
slumberer
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
happy
she
is
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
quietly
and
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
time
that
Mary
was
getting
breakfast
ready
,
and
performing
every
other
little
domestic
office
she
could
think
of
,
to
add
to
the
comfort
of
Jem
's
mother
,
Mrs.
Wilson
sat
still
in
the
arm
-
chair
,
watching
her
silently
.
 
<EOS>
Her
old
irritation
of
temper
and
manner
seemed
to
have
suddenly
disappeared
,
or
perhaps
she
was
too
depressed
in
body
and
mind
to
show
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
told
her
all
that
had
been
done
with
regard
to
Mr.
Bridgnorth
;
all
her
own
plans
for
seeking
out
Will
;
all
her
hopes
;
and
concealed
as
well
as
she
could
all
the
doubts
and
fears
that
would
arise
unbidden
.
  
<EOS>
To
this
Mrs.
Wilson
listened
without
much
remark
,
but
with
deep
interest
and
perfect
comprehension
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mary
ceased
,
she
sighed
,
and
said
,
"
O
wench
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
his
mother
,
and
yet
I
do
so
little
<EOS>
,
I
can
do
so
little
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
frets
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
seem
like
a
child
as
sees
its
mammy
ill
,
and
moans
and
cries
its
little
heart
out
,
yet
does
nought
to
help
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
my
sense
has
left
me
all
at
once
,
and
I
ca
n't
even
find
strength
to
cry
like
the
little
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hereupon
she
broke
into
a
feeble
wail
of
self
-
reproach
,
that
her
outward
show
of
misery
was
not
greater
;
as
if
any
cries
,
or
tears
,
or
loud
-
spoken
words
could
have
told
of
such
pangs
at
the
heart
as
that
look
,
and
that
thin
,
piping
,
altered
voice
!
  
<EOS>
But
think
of
Mary
and
what
she
was
enduring
.
 
<EOS>
Picture
to
yourself
<EOS>
(
for
I
can
not
tell
you
)
<EOS>
the
armies
of
thoughts
that
met
and
clashed
in
her
brain
;
and
then
imagine
the
effort
it
cost
her
to
be
calm
,
and
quiet
,
and
even
in
a
faint
way
,
cheerful
and
smiling
at
times
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
while
she
began
to
stir
about
in
her
own
mind
for
some
means
of
sparing
the
poor
mother
<EOS>
the
trial
of
appearing
as
a
witness
in
the
matter
of
the
gun
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
made
no
allusion
to
her
summons
this
morning
,
and
Mary
almost
thought
she
must
have
forgotten
it
;
and
surely
some
means
might
be
found
to
prevent
that
additional
sorrow
.
<EOS>
She
must
see
Job
about
it
;
nay
,
if
necessary
,
she
must
see
Mr.
Bridgnorth
,
with
all
his
truth
-
compelling
powers
;
for
,
indeed
,
she
had
so
struggled
and
triumphed
(
though
a
sadly
-
bleeding
victor
at
heart
)
over
herself
these
two
last
days
,
had
so
concealed
agony
,
and
hidden
her
inward
woe
and
bewilderment
,
that
she
began
to
take
confidence
,
and
to
have
faith
in
her
own
powers
of
meeting
any
one
with
a
passably
fair
show
,
whatever
might
be
rending
her
life
beneath
the
cloak
of
her
deception
.
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
as
soon
as
Mrs.
Davenport
came
in
after
morning
church
,
to
ask
after
the
two
lone
women
,
and
she
had
heard
the
report
Mary
had
to
give
(
so
much
better
as
regarded
Mrs.
Wilson
than
what
they
had
feared
the
night
before
it
would
have
been
)
 
as
soon
as
this
kind
-
hearted
,
grateful
woman
came
in
,
Mary
,
telling
her
purpose
,
went
off
to
fetch
the
doctor
who
attended
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
shaking
himself
after
his
morning
's
round
,
and
happy
in
the
anticipation
of
his
Sunday
's
dinner
;
but
he
was
a
good
-
tempered
man
,
who
found
it
difficult
to
keep
down
his
jovial
easiness
even
by
the
bed
of
sickness
or
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
mischosen
his
profession
;
for
it
was
his
delight
to
see
every
one
around
him
in
full
enjoyment
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
he
subdued
his
face
to
the
proper
expression
of
sympathy
,
befitting
a
doctor
listening
to
a
patient
,
or
a
patient
's
friend
(
and
Mary
's
sad
,
pale
,
anxious
face
might
be
taken
for
either
the
one
or
the
other
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
my
girl
!
<EOS>
and
what
brings
you
here
?
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
as
he
entered
his
surgery
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
on
your
own
account
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wanted
you
to
come
and
see
Alice
Wilson
,
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
thought
you
would
maybe
take
a
look
at
Mrs.
Wilson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
bustled
on
his
hat
and
coat
,
and
followed
Mary
instantly
.
  
<EOS>
After
shaking
his
head
over
Alice
(
as
if
it
was
a
mournful
thing
for
one
so
pure
and
good
,
so
true
,
although
so
humble
a
Christian
,
to
be
nearing
her
desired
haven
)
,
and
muttering
the
accustomed
words
intended
to
destroy
hope
,
and
prepare
anticipation
,
he
went
,
in
compliance
with
Mary
's
look
,
to
ask
the
usual
questions
of
Mrs.
Wilson
,
who
sat
passively
in
her
arm
-
chair
.
  
<EOS>
She
answered
his
questions
,
and
submitted
to
his
examination
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
think
her
?
"
asked
Mary
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
 
a
,
"
began
he
,
perceiving
that
he
was
desired
to
take
one
side
in
his
answer
,
and
unable
to
find
out
whether
his
listener
was
anxious
for
a
favourable
verdict
or
otherwise
;
but
thinking
it
most
probable
that
she
would
desire
the
former
,
he
continued
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
weak
,
certainly
;
the
natural
result
of
such
a
shock
as
the
arrest
of
her
son
would
be
,
 
for
I
understand
this
James
Wilson
,
who
murdered
Mr.
Carson
,
was
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
Sad
thing
to
have
such
a
reprobate
in
the
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
"
WHO
MURDERED
,
"
sir
!
"
said
Mary
indignantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
only
taken
up
on
suspicion
,
and
many
have
no
doubt
of
his
innocence
 
those
who
know
him
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
well
,
well
!
<EOS>
doctors
have
seldom
time
to
read
newspapers
,
and
I
dare
say
I
'm
not
very
correct
in
my
story
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
<EOS>
say
he
's
innocent
<EOS>
;
I
'm
sure
I
had
no
right
to
say
otherwise
,
 
only
words
slip
out
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
indeed
,
young
woman
,
I
see
no
cause
for
apprehension
about
this
poor
creature
in
the
next
room
;
 
weak
 
certainly
;
but
a
day
or
two
's
good
nursing
will
set
her
up
,
and
I
'm
sure
you
're
a
good
nurse
,
my
dear
,
from
your
pretty
kind
-
hearted
face
,
 
I
'll
send
a
couple
of
pills
and
a
draught
,
but
do
n't
alarm
yourself
 
<EOS>
there
's
no
occasion
,
I
assure
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
n't
think
her
fit
to
go
to
Liverpool
?
"
asked
Mary
,
still
in
the
anxious
tone
of
one
who
wishes
earnestly
for
some
particular
decision
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
Liverpool
 
yes
,
"
replied
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
short
journey
like
that
could
n't
fatigue
,
and
might
distract
her
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
Let
her
go
by
all
means
,
 
it
would
be
the
very
thing
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
sir
!
"
<EOS>
burst
out
Mary
,
almost
sobbing
;
"
I
did
so
hope
you
would
say
she
was
too
ill
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whew
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
he
,
with
a
prolonged
whistle
,
trying
to
understand
the
case
;
but
being
,
as
he
said
,
no
reader
of
newspapers
,
utterly
unaware
of
the
peculiar
reasons
there
might
be
for
so
apparently
unfeeling
a
wish
 
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
not
tell
me
so
sooner
?
 
<EOS>
It
might
certainly
do
her
harm
in
her
weak
state
!
<EOS>
there
is
always
some
risk
attending
journeys
 
draughts
,
and
what
not
.
 
<EOS>
To
her
,
they
might
prove
very
injurious
,
 
very
.
 
<EOS>
I
disapprove
of
journeys
,
or
excitement
,
in
all
cases
where
the
patient
is
in
the
low
,
fluttered
state
in
which
Mrs.
Wilson
is
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
take
MY
advice
,
you
will
certainly
put
a
stop
to
all
thoughts
of
going
to
Liverpool
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
really
had
completely
changed
his
opinion
,
though
quite
unconsciously
;
so
desirous
was
he
to
comply
with
the
wishes
of
others
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
sir
,
thank
you
!
 
<EOS>
And
will
you
give
me
a
certificate
of
her
being
unable
to
go
,
if
the
lawyer
says
he
must
have
one
?
 
<EOS>
The
lawyer
,
you
know
,
"
continued
she
,
seeing
him
look
puzzled
,
"
who
is
to
defend
Jem
,
 
<EOS>
it
was
as
a
witness
against
him
"
    
"
My
dear
girl
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
almost
angrily
,
"
why
did
you
not
state
the
case
fully
at
first
?
<EOS>
one
minute
would
have
done
it
,
 
and
my
dinner
waiting
all
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
she
ca
n't
go
,
 
it
would
be
madness
to
think
of
it
;
if
her
evidence
could
have
done
good
,
it
would
have
been
a
different
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Come
to
me
for
the
certificate
any
time
;
that
is
to
say
,
if
the
lawyer
advises
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
second
the
lawyer
;
take
counsel
with
both
the
learned
professions
 
ha
,
ha
,
ha
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
laughing
at
his
own
joke
,
he
departed
,
leaving
Mary
accusing
herself
of
stupidity
in
having
imagined
that
every
one
was
as
well
acquainted
with
the
facts
concerning
the
trial
as
she
was
herself
;
for
indeed
she
had
never
doubted
that
the
doctor
would
have
been
aware
of
the
purpose
of
poor
Mrs.
Wilson
's
journey
to
Liverpool
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
she
went
to
Job
<EOS>
(
the
ever
ready
Mrs.
Davenport
keeping
watch
over
the
two
old
women
)
,
and
told
him
her
fears
,
her
plans
,
and
her
proceedings
.
  
<EOS>
To
her
surprise
he
shook
his
head
doubtfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
have
an
awkward
look
,
if
we
keep
her
back
.
 
<EOS>
Lawyers
is
up
to
tricks
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
no
trick
,
"
said
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
so
poorly
,
she
was
last
night
so
,
at
least
;
and
to
-
day
she
's
so
faded
and
weak
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
soul
!
<EOS>
I
dare
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
mean
for
Jem
's
sake
;
and
so
much
is
known
,
it
wo
n't
do
now
to
hang
back
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
ask
Mr.
Bridgnorth
.
<EOS>
I
'll
e'en
take
your
doctor
's
advice
.
 
<EOS>
Yo
tarry
at
home

I
'll
come
to
yo

hour

"
   
<EOS>
MRS

<EOS>
WILSON
'S
DETERMINATION
.
 
<EOS>
"
Something
there
was
,
<EOS>
what
,
<EOS>
none
presumed
to
say
,
Clouds
lightly
passing
on
a
smiling
day
,
 
Whispers
and
hints
which
went
from
ear
to
ear
,
And
mixed
reports
no
judge
on
earth
could
clear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
CRABBE
.
  
<EOS>
"
Curious
conjectures
he
may
always
make
,
And
either
side
of
dubious
questions
take

"
  
<EOS>
IBID
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
went
home
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
her
head
did
ache
,
and
how
dizzy
her
brain
was
growing
!
 
<EOS>
But
there
would
be
time
enough
she
felt
for
giving
way
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
So
she
sat
quiet
and
still
by
an
effort
;
sitting
near
the
window
,
and
looking
out
of
it
,
but
seeing
nothing
,
when
all
at
once
she
caught
sight
of
something
which
roused
her
up
,
and
made
her
draw
back
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
seen
.
  
<EOS>
Sally
Leadbitter
flaunted
into
the
little
dingy
room
,
making
it
gaudy
with
the
Sunday
excess
of
colouring
in
her
dress
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
really
curious
to
see
Mary
;
her
connection
with
a
murderer
seemed
to
have
made
her
into
a
sort
of
lusus
naturae
,
and
was
almost
,
by
some
,
expected
to
have
made
a
change
in
her
personal
appearance
,
so
earnestly
did
they
stare
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mary
had
been
too
much
absorbed
the
last
day
or
two
to
notice
this
.
  
<EOS>
Now
Sally
had
a
grand
view
,
and
looked
her
over
and
over
(
a
very
different
thing
from
looking
her
through
and
through
)
,
and
almost
learnt
her
off
by
heart
:
 
<EOS>
"
Her
every
-
day
gown
(
Hoyle
's
print
you
know
,
that
lilac
thing
with
the
high
body
)
<EOS>
she
was
so
fond
of
;
a
little
black
silk
handkerchief
just
knotted
round
her
neck
,
like
a
boy
;
her
hair
all
taken
back
from
her
face
,
as
if
she
wanted
to
keep
her
head
cool
 
<EOS>
she
would
always
keep
that
hair
of
hers
so
long
;
and
her
hands
twitching
continually
about
"
    
Such
particulars
would
make
Sally
into
a
Gazette
Extraordinary
the
next
morning
at
the
workroom
and
were
worth
coming
for
,
even
if
little
else
could
be
extracted
from
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mary
!
<EOS>
"
she
began
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
have
you
hidden
yourself
?
 
<EOS>
You
never
showed
your
face
all
yesterday
at
Miss
Simmonds
's
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
fancy
<EOS>
we
think
any
the
worse
of
you
for
what
's
come
and
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Some
on
us
,
indeed
,
were
a
bit
sorry
for
the
poor
young
man
,
as
lies
stiff
and
cold
for
your
sake
,
Mary
;
but
we
shall
ne'er
cast
it
up
against
you
.
<EOS>
Miss
Simmonds
,
too
,
will
be
mighty
put
out
if
you
do
n't
come
,
<EOS>
for
there
's
a
deal
of
mourning
,
agait
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
,
"
Mary
said
,
in
a
low
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
ever
to
come
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mary
!
"
said
Sally
,
in
unfeigned
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
you
'll
have
to
be
in
Liverpool
,
Tuesday
,
and
maybe
Wednesday
;
but
after
that
you
'll
surely
come
,
and
tell
us
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Simmonds
knows
you
'll
have
to
be
off
those
two
days
.
 
<EOS>
But
between
you
and
me
,
she
's
a
bit
of
a
gossip
,
and
will
like
hearing
all
<EOS>
how
and
about
the
trial
,
well
enough
to
let
you
off
very
easy
for
your
being
absent
a
day
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
Betsy
Morgan
was
saying
yesterday
,
she
should
n't
wonder
<EOS>
but
you
'd
prove
quite
an
attraction
to
customers
.
<EOS>
Many
a
one
would
come
and
have
their
gowns
made
by
Miss
Simmonds
just
to
catch
a
glimpse
at
you
,
at
after
the
trial
's
over
.
 
<EOS>
Really
,
Mary
,
you
'll
turn
out
quite
a
heroine
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
little
fingers
twitched
worse
than
ever
;
the
large
soft
eyes
looked
up
pleadingly
into
Sally
's
face
;
but
she
went
on
in
the
same
strain
,
not
from
any
unkind
or
cruel
feeling
towards
Mary
,
but
solely
because
she
was
incapable
of
comprehending
her
suffering
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
been
shocked
,
of
course
,
at
Mr.
Carson
's
death
,
though
at
the
same
time
the
excitement
was
rather
pleasant
than
otherwise
;
and
dearly
now
would
she
have
enjoyed
the
conspicuous
notice
which
Mary
was
sure
to
receive
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
shall
you
like
being
cross
-
examined
,
Mary
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
at
all
,
"
answered
Mary
,
when
she
found
she
must
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
La
!
<EOS>
what
impudent
fellows
those
lawyers
are
!
 
<EOS>
And
their
clerks
,
too
,
not
a
bit
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
n't
wonder
"
(
in
a
comforting
tone
,
and
really
believing
she
was
giving
comfort
)
<EOS>
"
if
you
picked
up
a
new
sweetheart
in
Liverpool
.
 
<EOS>
What
gown
are
you
going
in
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
and
do
n't
care
,
"
exclaimed
Mary
,
sick
and
weary
of
her
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
!
take
my
advice
,
and
go
in
that
blue
merino
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
old
to
be
sure
,
and
a
bit
worn
at
elbows
,
but
folk
wo
n't
notice
that
,
and
th
'
colour
suits
you
.
 
<EOS>
Now
mind
,
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
'll
lend
you
my
black
-
watered
scarf
,
"
added
she
really
good
-
naturedly
,
according
to
her
sense
of
things
,
and
withal
,
a
little
bit
pleased
at
the
idea
of
her
pet
article
of
dress
figuring
away
on
the
person
of
a
witness
at
a
trial
for
murder
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
bring
it
to
-
morrow
before
you
start
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
do
n't
!
"
said
Mary
;
"
thank
you
,
but
I
do
n't
want
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
can
you
wear
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
all
your
clothes
as
well
as
I
do
my
own
,
and
what
is
there
you
can
wear
?
 
<EOS>
Not
your
old
plaid
shawl
,
I
do
hope
?
 
<EOS>
You
would
not
fancy
this
I
have
on
,
more
nor
the
scarf
,
would
you
?
"
said
she
,
brightening
up
at
the
thought
,
and
willing
to
lend
it
,
or
anything
else
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
Sally
!
<EOS>
do
n't
go
on
talking
a
-
that
<EOS>
-
ns
;
how
can
I
think
on
dress
at
such
a
time
?
 
<EOS>
When
it
's
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
Jem
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
the
girl
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
Jem
,
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Well
now
,
I
thought
there
was
some
sweetheart
in
the
background
,
when
you
flew
off
so
with
Mr.
Carson
.
 
<EOS>
Then
what
,
in
the
name
of
goodness
,
made
him
shoot
Mr.
Harry
?
 
<EOS>
After
you
had
given
up
going
with
him
,
I
mean
?
 
<EOS>
Was
he
afraid
you
'd
be
on
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
say
he
shot
Mr.
Harry
?
"
asked
Mary
,
firing
up
from
the
state
of
languid
indifference
into
which
she
had
sunk
while
Sally
had
been
settling
about
her
dress
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
no
matter
what
you
think
as
did
not
know
him
.
 
<EOS>
What
grieves
me
is
,
that
people
should
go
on
thinking
him
guilty
as
did
know
him
,
"
she
said
,
sinking
back
into
her
former
depressed
tone
and
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
n't
you
think
he
did
it
?
"
asked
Sally
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
paused
;
she
was
going
on
too
fast
with
one
so
curious
and
so
unscrupulous
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
she
remembered
how
even
she
herself
had
,
at
first
,
believed
him
guilty
;
and
she
felt
it
was
not
for
her
to
cast
stones
at
those
who
,
on
similar
evidence
,
inclined
to
the
same
belief
.
 
<EOS>
None
had
given
him
much
benefit
of
a
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
None
had
faith
in
his
innocence
.
 
<EOS>
None
but
his
mother
;
and
the
heart
loved
more
than
the
head
reasoned
,
and
her
yearning
affection
had
never
for
an
instant
entertained
the
idea
that
her
Jem
was
a
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mary
disliked
the
whole
conversation
;
the
subject
,
the
manner
in
which
it
was
treated
,
were
all
painful
,
and
she
had
a
repugnance
to
the
person
with
whom
she
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
thankful
,
therefore
,
when
Job
Legh
's
voice
was
heard
at
the
door
,
as
he
stood
with
the
latch
in
his
hand
,
talking
to
a
neighbour
,
and
when
Sally
jumped
up
in
vexation
and
said
,
"
There
's
that
old
fogey
coming
in
here
,
as
I
'm
alive
!
 
<EOS>
Did
your
father
set
him
to
look
after
you
while
he
was
away
?
<EOS>
or
what
brings
the
old
chap
here
?
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
'm
off
;
I
never
could
abide
either
him
or
his
prim
grand
-
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
far
in
a
whisper
,
then
louder
,
"
If
you
think
better
of
my
offer
about
the
scarf
,
Mary
,
just
step
in
to
-
morrow
before
nine
,
and
you
're
quite
welcome
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
and
Job
passed
each
other
at
the
door
,
with
mutual
looks
of
dislike
,
which
neither
took
any
pains
to
conceal
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yon
's
a
bold
,
bad
girl
,
"
said
Job
to
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
very
good
-
natured
,
"
replied
Mary
,
too
honourable
to
abuse
a
visitor
,
who
had
only
that
instant
crossed
her
threshold
,
and
gladly
dwelling
on
the
good
quality
most
apparent
in
Sally
's
character
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
!
good
-
natured
,
generous
,
jolly
,
full
of
fun
;
there
are
a
number
of
other
names
for
the
good
qualities
the
devil
leaves
his
children
,
as
baits
to
catch
gudgeons
with
.
 
<EOS>
D'ye
think
folk
could
be
led
astray
by
one
who
was
every
way
bad
?
 
<EOS>
Howe'er
,
that
's
not
what
I
came
to
talk
about
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
seen
Mr.
Bridgnorth
,
and
he
is
in
a
manner
the
same
mind
as
we
;
he
thinks
it
would
have
an
awkward
look
,
and
might
tell
against
the
poor
lad
on
his
trial
;
still
if
she
's
ill
<EOS>
she
's
ill
,
and
it
ca
n't
be
helped
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
if
she
's
so
bad
as
all
that
,
"
said
Mary
,
who
began
to
dread
her
part
in
doing
anything
which
might
tell
against
her
poor
lover
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
come
and
see
her
,
Job
?
 
<EOS>
The
doctor
seemed
to
say
as
I
liked
,
not
as
he
thought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
because
he
had
no
great
thought
on
the
subject
,
either
one
way
or
t'other
,
"
replied
Job
,
whose
contempt
for
medical
men
pretty
nearly
equalled
his
respect
for
lawyers
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
'll
go
and
welcome
.
<EOS>
I
han
not
seen
th
'
ould
ladies
since
their
sorrows
,
and
it
's
but
<EOS>
manners
to
go
and
ax
after

<EOS>
Come
along
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
room
at
Mrs.
Wilson
's
had
that
still
,
changeless
look
<EOS>
you
must
have
often
observed
in
the
house
of
sickness
or
mourning
.
 
<EOS>
No
particular
employment
going
on
<EOS>
;
people
watching
and
waiting
rather
than
acting
,
unless
in
the
more
sudden
and
violent
attacks
:
what
little
movement
is
going
on
,
so
noiseless
and
hushed
;
the
furniture
all
arranged
and
stationary
,
with
a
view
to
the
comfort
of
the
afflicted
;
the
window
-
blinds
drawn
down
to
keep
out
the
disturbing
variety
of
a
sunbeam
;
the
same
saddened
serious
look
on
the
faces
of
the
indwellers
:
you
fall
back
into
the
same
train
of
thought
with
all
these
associations
,
and
forget
the
street
,
the
outer
world
,
in
the
contemplation
of
the
one
stationary
,
absorbing
interest
within
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilson
sat
quietly
in
her
chair
,
with
just
the
same
look
Mary
had
left
on
her
face
;
Mrs.
Davenport
went
about
with
creaking
shoes
which
made
all
the
more
noise
from
her
careful
and
lengthened
tread
,
annoying
the
ears
of
those
who
were
well
,
in
this
instance
,
far
more
than
the
dull
senses
of
the
sick
and
the
sorrowful
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
's
voice
still
was
going
on
cheerfully
in
the
upper
room
with
incessant
talking
and
little
laughs
to
herself
,
or
perhaps
in
sympathy
with
her
unseen
companions
;
"
unseen
,
"
I
say
,
in
preference
to
"
fancied
,
"
for
who
knows
whether
God
does
not
permit
the
forms
of
those
who
were
dearest
when
living
,
to
hover
round
the
bed
of
the
dying
?
  
<EOS>
Job
spoke
,
and
Mrs.
Wilson
answered
.
  
<EOS>
So
quietly
that
it
was
unnatural
under
the
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
It
made
a
deeper
impression
on
the
old
man
than
any
token
of
mere
bodily
illness
could
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
had
raved
in
delirium
,
or
moaned
in
fever
,
he
could
have
spoken
after
his
wo
nt
,
and
given
his
opinion
,
his
advice
,
and
his
consolation
:
now
he
was
awed
into
silence
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
he
pulled
Mary
aside
into
a
corner
of
the
house
-
place
,
where
Mrs.
Wilson
was
sitting
,
and
began
to
talk
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo're
right
,
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
She
's
no
ways
fit
to
go
to
Liverpool
,
poor
soul
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
've
seen
her
<EOS>
I
only
wonder
the
doctor
could
ha
'
been
unsettled
in
his
mind
at
th
'
first
.
 
<EOS>
Choose
how
it
goes
wi
'
poor
Jem
,
she
can
not
go
.
 
<EOS>
One
way
or
another
it
will
soon
be
over
;
the
best
to
leave
her
in
the
state
she
is
till
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
sure
you
would
think
so
,
"
said
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
But
they
were
reckoning
without
their
host
.
 
<EOS>
They
esteemed
her
senses
gone
,
while
,
in
fact
,
they
were
only
inert
,
and
could
not
convey
impressions
rapidly
to
the
overburdened
,
troubled
brain
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
noticed
that
her
eyes
had
followed
them
(
mechanically
it
seemed
at
first
)
as
they
had
moved
away
to
the
corner
of
the
room
;
that
her
face
,
hitherto
so
changeless
,
had
begun
to
work
with
one
or
two
of
the
old
symptoms
of
impatience
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
they
were
silent
she
stood
up
,
and
startled
them
almost
as
if
a
dead
person
had
spoken
,
by
saying
clearly
and
decidedly
   
"
I
go
to
Liverpool
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
you
and
your
plans
;
and
I
tell
you
I
shall
go
to
Liverpool
.
 
<EOS>
If
my
words
are
to
kill
my
son
,
they
have
already
gone
forth
out
of
my
mouth
,
and
nought
can
bring
them
back
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
have
faith
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
(
up
above
)
has
often
telled
me
I
wanted
faith
,
and
now
I
will
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
can
not
 
they
will
not
kill
my
child
,
my
only
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
afeard
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
am
so
sick
with
terror
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
he
is
to
die
,
think
ye
not
that
I
will
see
him
again
;
ay
!
<EOS>
see
him
at
his
trial
?
 
<EOS>
When
all
are
hating
him
,
he
shall
have
his
poor
mother
near
him
,
to
give
him
all
the
comfort
,
eyes
,
and
looks
,
and
tears
,
and
a
heart
that
is
dead
to
all
but
him
,
can
give
;
his
poor
mother
,
who
knows
how
free
he
is
from
sin
 
in
the
sight
of
man
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
They
'll
let
me
go
to
him
,
<EOS>
maybe
,
the
very
minute
it
's
over
;
and
I
know
many
Scripture
texts
(
though
you
would
not
think
it
)
,
that
may
keep
up
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
missed
seeing
him
ere
<EOS>
he
went
to
yon
prison
,
but
nought
shall
keep
me
away
again
one
minute
when
I
can
see
his
face
;
for
maybe
the
minutes
are
numbered
,
and
the
count
but
small
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
can
be
a
comfort
to
him
,
poor
lad
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
not
think
it
,
now
,
but
he
'd
always
speak
as
kind
and
soft
to
me
as
if
he
were
courting
me
,
like
.
 
<EOS>
He
loved
me
above
a
bit
;
and
am
I
to
leave
him
now
to
dree
all
the
cruel
slander
they
'll
put
upon
him
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
pray
for
him
at
each
hard
word
they
say
against
him
,
if
I
can
do
nought
else
;
and
he
'll
know
what
his
mother
is
doing
for
him
,
poor
lad
,
by
the
look
on
my
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Still
they
made
some
look
,
or
gesture
of
opposition
to
her
wishes
.
<EOS>
She
turned
sharp
round
on
Mary
,
the
old
object
of
her
pettish
attacks
,
and
said
,
"
Now
,
wench
!
<EOS>
once
for
all
,
I
tell
you
this
.
 
<EOS>
HE
could
never
guide
me
;
and
he
'd
sense
enough
not
to
try
.
 
<EOS>
What
he
could
na
do
,
do
n't
you
try
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
go
to
Liverpool
tomorrow
,
and
find
my
lad
,
and
stay
with
him
through
thick
and
thin
;
and
if
he
dies
,
why
,
perhaps
,
God
of
His
mercy
will
take
me
too
.
 
<EOS>
The
grave
is
a
sure
cure
for
an
aching
heart
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
sank
back
in
her
chair
,
quite
exhausted
by
the
sudden
effort
she
had
made
;
but
if
they
even
offered
to
speak
,
she
cut
them
short
(
whatever
the
subject
might
be
)
,
with
the
repetition
of
the
same
words
,
"
I
shall
go
to
Liverpool
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
No
more
could
be
said
,
the
doctor
's
opinion
had
been
so
undecided
;
Mr.
Bridgnorth
had
given
his
legal
voice
in
favour
of
her
going
,
and
Mary
was
obliged
to
relinquish
the
idea
of
persuading
her
to
remain
at
home
,
if
,
indeed
,
under
all
the
circumstances
,
it
could
be
thought
desirable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Best
way
will
be
,
"
said
Job
,
"
for
me
to
hunt
out
Will
,
early
tomorrow
morning
,
and
yo
,
Mary
,
come
at
after
with
Jane
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
a
decent
woman
where
yo
two
can
have
a
bed
,
and
where
we
may
meet
together
when
I
've
found
Will
,
afore
going
to
Mr.
Bridgnorth
's
at
two
o'clock
;
for
,
I
can
tell
him
,
I
'll
not
trust
none
of
his
clerks
for
hunting
up
Will
,
if
Jem
's
life
's
to
depend
on
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Now
Mary
disliked
this
plan
inexpressibly
;
her
dislike
was
partly
grounded
on
reason
,
and
partly
on
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
deputing
to
any
one
the
active
measures
necessary
to
be
taken
in
order
to
save
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
She
felt
as
if
they
were
her
duty
,
<EOS>
her
right
.
 
<EOS>
She
durst
not
trust
to
any
one
the
completion
of
her
plan
:
they
might
not
have
energy
,
or
perseverance
,
or
desperation
enough
to
follow
out
the
slightest
chance
;
and
her
love
would
endow
her
with
all
these
qualities
independently
of
the
terrible
alternative
which
awaited
her
in
case
all
failed
and
Jem
was
condemned
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
could
have
her
motives
;
and
consequently
no
one
could
have
her
sharpened
brain
,
her
despairing
determination
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
(
only
that
was
purely
selfish
)
,
she
could
not
endure
the
suspense
of
remaining
quiet
,
and
only
knowing
the
result
when
all
was
accomplished
.
  
<EOS>
So
with
vehemence
and
impatience
she
rebutted
every
reason
Job
adduced
for
his
plan
;
and
of
course
,
thus
opposed
,
by
what
appeared
to
him
wilfulness
,
he
became
more
resolute
,
and
angry
words
were
exchanged
,
and
a
feeling
of
estrangement
rose
up
between
them
,
for
a
time
,
as
they
walked
homewards
.
  
<EOS>
But
then
came
in
Margaret
with
her
gentleness
,
like
an
angel
of
peace
,
so
calm
and
reasonable
,
that
both
felt
ashamed
of
their
irritation
,
and
tacitly
left
the
decision
to
her
(
only
,
by
the
way
,
I
think
Mary
could
never
have
submitted
if
it
had
gone
against
her
,
penitent
and
tearful
<EOS>
as
was
her
manner
now
to
Job
,
the
good
old
man
who
was
helping
her
to
work
for
Jem
,
although
they
differed
as
to
the
manner
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
had
better
go
,
"
said
Margaret
to
her
grandfather
,
in
a
low
tone
;
"
I
know
what
she
's
feeling
,
and
it
will
be
a
comfort
to
her
soon
,
maybe
,
to
think
she
did
all
she
could
herself
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
,
perhaps
,
fancy
it
might
have
been
different
;
do
,
grandfather
,
let
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Margaret
had
still
,
you
see
,
little
or
no
belief
in
Jem
's
innocence
and
besides
,
she
thought
if
Mary
saw
Will
,
and
heard
herself
from
him
that
Jem
had
not
been
with
him
that
Thursday
night
,
it
would
in
a
measure
break
the
force
of
the
blow
which
was
impending
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
lock
up
house
,
grandfather
,
for
a
couple
of
days
,
and
go
and
stay
with
Alice
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
but
<EOS>
little
one
like
me
can
do
,
I
know
"
(
she
added
softly
)
;
"
but
,
by
the
blessing
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
God
,
I
'll
do
it
and
welcome
;
and
here
comes
one
kindly
use
o
'
money
,
I
can
hire
them
as
will
do
for
her
what
I
can
not
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davenport
is
a
willing
body
,
and
one
who
knows
sorrow
and
sickness
,
and
I
can
pay
her
for
her
time
,
and
keep
her
there
pretty
near
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
So
let
that
be
settled
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
take
Mrs.
Wilson
,
dear
grandad
,
and
let
Mary
go
find
Will
,
and
you
can
all
meet
together
at
after
,
and
I
'm
sure
I
wish
you
luck
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Job
consented
with
only
a
few
dissenting
grunts
;
but
on
the
whole
with
a
very
good
grace
for
an
old
man
who
had
been
so
positive
only
a
few
minutes
before
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
was
thankful
for
Margaret
's
interference
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
speak
,
but
threw
her
arms
round
Margaret
's
neck
,
and
put
up
her
rosy
-
red
mouth
to
be
kissed
;
and
even
Job
was
attracted
by
the
pretty
,
child
-
like
gesture
;
and
when
she
drew
near
him
,
afterwards
,
like
a
little
creature
sidling
up
to
some
person
whom
it
feels
to
have
offended
,
he
bent
down
and
blessed
her
,
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
of
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
To
Mary
the
old
man
's
blessing
came
like
words
of
power
.

The
early
trains
for
Liverpool
,
on
Monday
morning
,
were
 
crowded
by
attorneys
,
attorneys
'
clerks
,
plaintiffs
,
defendants
,
and
witnesses
,
all
going
to
the
Assizes
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
a
motley
assembly
,
each
with
some
cause
for
anxiety
stirring
at
his
heart
;
though
,
after
all
,
that
is
saying
little
or
nothing
,
for
we
are
all
of
us
in
the
same
predicament
through
life
;
each
with
a
fear
and
a
hope
from
childhood
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
passengers
there
was
Mary
Barton
,
dressed
in
the
blue
gown
and
obnoxious
plaid
shawl
.
  
<EOS>
Common
as
railroads
are
now
in
all
places
as
a
means
of
transit
,
and
especially
in
Manchester
,
Mary
had
never
been
on
one
before
;
and
she
felt
bewildered
by
the
hurry
,
the
noise
of
people
,
and
bells
,
and
horns
;
the
whiz
and
the
scream
of
the
arriving
trains
.
  
<EOS>
The
very
journey
itself
seemed
to
her
a
matter
of
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
a
back
seat
,
and
looked
towards
the
factory
-
chimneys
,
and
the
cloud
of
smoke
which
hovers
over
Manchester
,
with
a
feeling
akin
to
the
"
Heimweh
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
was
losing
sight
of
the
familiar
objects
of
her
childhood
for
the
first
time
;
and
unpleasant
as
those
objects
are
to
most
<EOS>
,
she
yearned
after
them
with
some
of
the
same
sentiment
which
gives
pathos
to
the
thoughts
of
the
emigrant
.
  
<EOS>
The
cloud
-
shadows
which
give
beauty
to
Chat
-
Moss
,
the
picturesque
old
houses
of
Newton
,
what
were
they
to
Mary
,
whose
heart
was
full
of
many
things
?
 
<EOS>
Yet
she
seemed
to
look
at
them
earnestly
as
they
glided
past
;
but
she
neither
saw
nor
heard
.
  
<EOS>
She
neither
saw
nor
heard
till
some
well
-
known
names
fell
upon
her
ear
.
  
<EOS>
Two
lawyers
'
clerks
were
discussing
the
cases
to
come
on
that
Assizes
;
of
course
,
"
the
murder
case
,
"
as
it
had
come
to
be
termed
,
held
a
conspicuous
place
in
their
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
no
doubt
of
the
result
.
  
<EOS>
"
Juries
are
always
very
unwilling
to
convict
on
circumstantial
evidence
,
it
is
true
,
"
said
one
,
"
<EOS>
but
here
there
can
hardly
be
any
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
had
not
been
so
clear
a
case
,
"
replied
the
other
,
"
I
should
have
said
they
were
injudicious
in
hurrying
on
the
trial
so
much
.
<EOS>
Still
,
more
evidence
might
have
been
collected
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
tell
me
,
"
said
the
first
speaker
 
"
the
people
in
Gardener
's
office
,
<EOS>
I
mean
 
that
it
was
really
feared
the
old
gentleman
would
have
gone
out
of
his
mind
,
if
the
trial
had
been
delayed
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
with
Mr.
Gardener
as
many
as
seven
times
on
Saturday
,
and
called
him
up
at
night
to
suggest
that
some
letter
should
be
written
,
or
something
done
to
secure
the
verdict
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
old
man
,
"
answered
his
companion
,
"
who
can
wonder
?
 
<EOS>
an
only
son
,
 
such
a
death
,
 
the
disagreeable
circumstances
attending
it
<EOS>
;
I
had
not
time
to
read
the
Guardian
on
Saturday
,
but
I
understand
it
was
some
dispute
about
a
factory
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
some
such
person
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
she
'll
be
examined
,
and
Williams
will
do
it
in
style
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
slip
out
from
our
court
to
hear
him
,
if
I
can
hit
the
nick
of
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
you
can
get
a
place
,
you
mean
,
for
depend
upon
it
the
court
will
be
crowded
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
the
ladies
(
sweet
souls
)
will
come
in
shoals
to
hear
a
trial
for
murder
,
and
see
the
murderer
,
and
watch
the
judge
put
on
his
black
cap
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
then
go
home
and
groan
over
the
Spanish
ladies
who
take
delight
in
bull
-
fights
"
such
unfeminine
creatures
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
they
went
on
to
other
subjects
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
but
another
drop
to
Mary
's
cup
;
but
she
was
nearly
in
that
state
which
Crabbe
describes
   
<EOS>
"
For
when
so
full
the
cup
of
sorrows
flows
,
Add
but
a
drop
it
instantly
o'erflows
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
now
they
were
in
the
tunnel
!
 
<EOS>
and
now
they
were
in
Liverpool
;
and
she
must
rouse
herself
from
the
torpor
of
mind
and
body
which
was
creeping
over
her
;
the
result
of
much
anxiety
and
fatigue
,
and
several
sleepless
nights
.
  
<EOS>
She
asked
a
policeman
the
way
to
Milk
House
Yard
,
and
following
his
directions
with
the
savoir
faire
of
a
town
-
bred
girl
,
she
reached
a
little
court
leading
out
of
a
busy
,
thronged
street
,
not
far
from
the
Docks
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
entered
the
quiet
little
yard
,
she
stopped
to
regain
her
breath
,
and
to
gather
strength
,
for
her
limbs
trembled
,
and
her
heart
beat
violently
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
unfavourable
contingencies
she
had
,
until
now
,
forbidden
herself
to
dwell
upon
,
came
forward
to
her
mind
 
<EOS>
the
possibility
,
the
bare
possibility
,
of
Jem
being
an
accomplice
in
the
murder
 
the
still
greater
possibility
that
he
had
not
fulfilled
his
intention
of
going
part
of
the
way
with
Will
,
but
had
been
led
off
by
some
little
accidental
occurrence
from
his
original
intention
;
and
that
he
had
spent
the
evening
with
those
,
whom
it
was
now
too
late
to
bring
forward
as
witnesses
.
  
<EOS>
But
sooner
or
later
she
must
know
the
truth
;
so
,
taking
courage
,
she
knocked
at
the
door
of
a
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
this
Mrs.
Jones
's
?
"
<EOS>
she
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Next
door
but
one
,
"
was
the
curt
answer
.
  
<EOS>
And
even
this
extra
minute
was
a
reprieve
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jones
was
busy
washing
,
and
would
have
spoken
angrily
to
the
person
who
knocked
so
gently
at
the
door
,
if
anger
had
been
in
her
nature
;
but
she
was
a
soft
,
helpless
kind
of
woman
,
and
only
sighed
over
the
many
interruptions
she
had
had
to
her
business
that
unlucky
Monday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
feeling
which
would
have
been
anger
in
a
more
impatient
temper
,
took
the
form
of
prejudice
against
the
disturber
,
whoever
he
or
she
might
be
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
's
fluttered
and
excited
appearance
strengthened
this
prejudice
in
Mrs.
Jones
's
mind
,
as
she
stood
,
stripping
the
soap
-
suds
off
her
arms
,
while
she
eyed
her
visitor
,
and
waited
to
be
told
what
her
business
was
.
  
<EOS>
But
no
words
would
come
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
's
voice
seemed
choked
up
in
her
throat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
what
do
you
want
,
young
woman
?
"
coldly
asked
Mrs.
Jones
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
is
Will
Wilson
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
is
not
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Jones
,
inclining
to
shut
the
door
in
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
not
come
back
from
the
Isle
of
Man
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Mary
,
sickening
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
never
went
;
he
stayed
in
Manchester
too
long
;
as
perhaps
you
know
,
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
again
the
door
seemed
closing
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mary
bent
forwards
with
suppliant
action
(
as
some
young
tree
bends
,
when
blown
by
the
rough
,
autumnal
wind
)
,
and
gasped
out
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
 
tell
 
me
 
<EOS>
where
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jones
suspected
some
love
affair
,
and
,
perhaps
,
one
of
not
the
most
creditable
kind
;
but
the
distress
of
the
pale
young
creature
before
her
was
so
obvious
and
so
pitiable
,
that
were
she
ever
so
sinful
,
Mrs.
Jones
could
no
longer
uphold
her
short
,
reserved
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
gone
this
very
morning
,
<EOS>
my
poor
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Step
in
,
and
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gone
!
"
<EOS>
cried
"
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
gone
?
 
<EOS>
I
must
see
him
,
 
<EOS>
it
's
a
matter
of
life
and
death
:
he
can
save
the
innocent
from
being
hanged
,
 
he
can
not
be
gone
,
 
how
gone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sailed
,
my
dear

sailed
in
the
John
Cropper
this
very
blessed
morning
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Sailed
!
"
   
<EOS>
IN
THE
LIVERPOOL
DOCKS
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yon
is
our

Hark
to
the
clamour
in
that
miry
road
,
Bounded
and
narrowed
by
yon
vessel
's
load

;
The
lumbering
wealth
she
empties
round
the
place
,
Package
and
parcel

hogshead

chest

While

the
angry

Mingling
in
business

bellow
to
the
wind

<EOS>
CRABBE
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
staggered
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jones
placed
her
tenderly
in
a
chair
,
and
there
stood
bewildered
by
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
father
!
<EOS>
father
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
she
,
"
what
have
you
done
!
 
<EOS>
What
must
I
do
?
<EOS>
must
the
innocent
die
?
 
<EOS>
or
he
 
<EOS>
whom
I
fear
 
<EOS>
I
fear
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
what
am
I
saying
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
looking
round
affrighted
,
and
,
seemingly
reassured
by
Mrs.
Jones
's
countenance
,
"
I
am
so
helpless
,
so
weak
 
but
<EOS>
a
poor
girl
,
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
How
can
I
tell
what
is
right
?
 
<EOS>
Father
!
<EOS>
you
have
always
been
so
kind
to
me
,
 
and
you
to
be
 
<EOS>
never

<EOS>
never

all
will
come
right
in
the
grave

"
  
<EOS>
"
Save
us
,
and
bless
us
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mrs.
Jones
,
"
if
I
do
n't
think
she
's
gone
out
of
her
wits
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
am
not
,
"
said
Mary
,
catching
at
the
words
,
and
with
a
strong
effort
controlling
the
mind
she
felt
to
be
wandering
,
while
the
red
blood
flushed
to
scarlet
the
heretofore
white
cheek
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
out
of
my
senses
;
there
is
so
much
to
be
done
 
so
much
 
and
no
one
but
<EOS>
me
to
do
it
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
though
I
ca
n't
rightly
tell
what
it
is
,
"
looking
up
with
bewilderment
into
Mrs.
Jones
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
go
mad
<EOS>
whatever
comes
 
at
least
not
yet
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
"
<EOS>
(
bracing
herself
up
)
"
something
may
yet
be
done
,
and
I
must
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Sailed
!
<EOS>
did
you
say
?
<EOS>
The
John
Cropper
?
 
<EOS>
Sailed
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
she
went
out
of
dock
last
night
,
to
be
ready
for
the
morning
's
tide
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
she
was
not
to
sail
till
to
-
morrow
,
"
murmured
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
did
Will
(
he
's
lodged
here
long
,
so
we
all
call
him
"
Will
"
)
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Jones
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
mate
had
told
him
so
,
I
believe
,
and
he
never
knew
different
till
he
got
to
Liverpool
on
Friday
morning
;
but
as
soon
as
he
heard
,
he
gave
up
going
to
the
Isle
o
'
Man
,
and
just
ran
over
to
Rhyl
with
the
mate
,
one
John
Harris
,
as
has
friends
a
bit
beyond
Abergele
;
you
may
have
heard
him
speak
on
him
;
for
they
are
great
chums
,
though
I
've
my
own
opinion
of
Harris
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
's
sailed
?
"
<EOS>
repeated
Mary
,
trying
by
repetition
to
realise
the
fact
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
he
went
on
board
last
night
to
be
ready
for
the
morning
's
tide
,
as
I
said
afore
,
and
my
boy
went
to
see
the
ship
go
down
the
river
,
and
came
back
all
agog
with
the
sight
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
Charley
,
Charley
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
called
out
loudly
for
her
son
;
but
Charley
was
one
of
those
boys
who
are
never
"
far
to
seek
,
"
as
the
Lancashire
people
say
,
when
anything
is
going
on
;
a
mysterious
conversation
,
an
unusual
event
,
a
fire
,
or
a
riot
,
anything
in
short
;
such
boys
are
the
little
omnipresent
people
of
this
world
.
  
<EOS>
Charley
had
,
in
fact
,
been
spectator
and
auditor
all
this
time
;
though
for
a
little
while
he
had
been
engaged
in
"
dollying
"
and
a
few
other
mischievous
feats
in
the
washing
line
,
which
had
prevented
his
attention
from
being
fully
given
to
his
mother
's
conversation
with
the
strange
girl
who
had
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
Charley
!
<EOS>
there
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
Did
you
not
see
the
John
Cropper
sail
down
the
river
this
morning
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
the
young
woman
about
it
,
for
I
think
she
hardly
credits
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
saw
her
tugged
down
the
river
by
a
steamboat
,
which
comes
to
the
same
thing
,
"
replied
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
I
had
but
come
last
night
!
"
moaned
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
never
thought
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
but
<EOS>
what
he
knew
right
when
he
said
he
would
be
back
from
the
Isle
of
Man
on
Monday
morning
,
and
not
afore
 
<EOS>
and
now
some
one
must
die
for
my
negligence
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Die
!
"
exclaimed
the
lad
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
Will
would
have
proved
an
alibi
,
 
but
he
's
gone
,
 
and
<EOS>
what
am
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
give
it
up
yet
,
"
cried
the
energetic
boy
,
interested
at
once
in
the
case
;
"
let
's
have
a
try
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
but
<EOS>
where
we
were
,
if
we
fail
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
roused
herself
.
 
<EOS>
The
sympathetic
"
we
"
gave
her
heart
and
hope
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
can
be
done
?
 
<EOS>
You
say
he
's
sailed
;
what
can
be
done
?
"
 
<EOS>
But
she
spoke
louder
,
and
in
a
more
life
-
like
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
say
he
'd
sailed
;
mother
said
that
,
and
women
know
nought
about
such
matters
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
"
(
proud
of
his
office
of
instructor
,
and
insensibly
influenced
,
as
all
about
her
were
,
by
Mary
's
sweet
,
earnest
,
lovely
countenance
)
<EOS>
,
"
there
's
sandbanks
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
,
and
ships
ca
n't
get
over
them
but
at
high
-
water
;
especially
ships
of
heavy
burden
,
like
the
John
Cropper
.
<EOS>
Now
she
was
tugged
down
the
river
at
low
water
,
or
pretty
near
,
and
will
have
to
lie
some
time
before
the
water
will
be
high
enough
to
float
her
over
the
banks
.
 
<EOS>
So
hold
up
your
head
,
 
you
've
a
chance
yet
,
though
,
maybe
,
but
a
poor
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
must
I
do
?
"
asked
Mary
,
to
whom
all
this
explanation
had
been
a
vague
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
boy
impatiently
,
"
why
,
have
not
I
told
you
?
 
<EOS>
Only
women
(
begging
your
pardon
)
are
so
stupid
at
understanding
about
anything
belonging
to
the
sea
;
 
you
must
get
a
boat
,
and
make
all
haste
,
and
sail
after
him
,
 
after
the
John
Cropper
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
overtake
her
,
or
you
may
not
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
just
a
chance
;
but
she
's
heavy
laden
,
and
that
's
in
your
favour
.
 
<EOS>
She
'll
draw
many
feet
of
water
.
<EOS>
"
  
Mary
had
humbly
and
eagerly
(
oh
,
how
eagerly
!
)
<EOS>
listened
to
this
young
Sir
Oracle
's
speech
;
but
try
as
she
would
<EOS>
,
she
could
only
understand
that
she
must
make
haste
,
and
sail
 
somewhere
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
(
and
her
little
acknowledgment
of
inferiority
in
this
speech
pleased
the
lad
,
and
made
him
her
still
more
zealous
friend
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
said
she
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
know
where
to
get
a
boat
.
 
<EOS>
Are
there
boat
-
stands
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
lad
laughed
outright
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
long
in
Liverpool
,
I
guess
.
 
<EOS>
Boat
-
stands
!
 
<EOS>
No
;
go
down
to
the
pier
,
 
any
pier
will
do
,
and
hire
a
boat
,
 
<EOS>
you
'll
be
at
no
loss
when
once
you
are
there
.
 
<EOS>
Only
make
haste
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
need
not
tell
me
that
,
if
I
but
knew
how
,
"
said
Mary
,
trembling
with
eagerness
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
say
right
,
 
I
never
was
here
before
,
and
I
do
n't
know
my
way
to
the
place
you
speak
on
;
only
tell
me
,
and
I
'll
not
lose
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
"
said
the
wilful
lad
,
"
I
'm
going
to
show
her
the
way
to
the
pier
;
I
'll
be
back
in
an
hour
,
 
or
so
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
.
  
<EOS>
And
before
the
gentle
Mrs.
Jones
could
collect
her
scattered
wits
sufficiently
to
understand
half
of
the
hastily
-
formed
plan
,
her
son
was
scudding
down
the
street
,
closely
followed
by
Mary
's
half
-
running
steps
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
he
slackened
his
pace
sufficiently
to
enable
him
to
enter
into
conversation
with
Mary
,
for
once
escaped
from
the
reach
of
his
mother
's
recalling
voice
,
he
thought
he
might
venture
to
indulge
his
curiosity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ahem
!
 
<EOS>
What
's
your
name
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
so
awkward
to
be
calling
you
young
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Mary
,
 
Mary
Barton
,
"
answered
she
,
anxious
to
propitiate
one
who
seemed
so
willing
to
exert
himself
in
her
behalf
,
or
else
she
grudged
every
word
which
caused
the
slightest
relaxation
in
her
speed
,
although
her
chest
seemed
tightened
,
and
her
head
throbbing
,
from
the
rate
at
which
they
were
walking
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
want
Will
Wilson
to
prove
an
alibi
 
is
that
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
 
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
,
 
can
we
not
cross
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
wait
a
minute
;
it
's
the
teagle
hoisting
above
your
head
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
of
;
and
who
is
it
<EOS>
that
's
to
be
tried
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jem
;
oh
,
lad
!
<EOS>
ca
n't
we
get
past
?
"
  
<EOS>
They
rushed
under
the
great
bales
quivering
in
the
air
above
their
heads
and
pressed
onward
for
a
few
minutes
,
till
Master
Charley
again
saw
fit
to
walk
a
little
slower
,
and
ask
a
few
more
questions
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
is
Jem
your
brother
,
or
your
sweetheart
,
that
you
're
so
set
upon
saving
him
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
 
no
,
"
replied
she
,
but
with
something
of
hesitation
,
that
made
the
shrewd
boy
yet
more
anxious
to
clear
up
the
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
's
your
cousin
,
then
?
 
<EOS>
Many
a
girl
has
a
cousin
who
has
not
a
sweetheart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
's
neither
kith
nor
kin
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
stopping
for
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
with
nervous
terror
,
as
Charley
turned
back
a
few
steps
,
and
peered
up
a
side
street
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
nothing
to
flurry
you
so
,
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
you
say
to
mother
<EOS>
you
had
never
been
in
Liverpool
before
,
and
if
you
'll
only
look
up
this
street
you
may
see
the
back
windows
of
our
Exchange
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
building
as
yon
is
!
<EOS>
with
'
natomy
hiding
under
a
blanket
,
and
Lord
Admiral
Nelson
,
and
a
few
more
people
in
the
middle
of
the
court
!
<EOS>
No
!
come
here
,
"
as
Mary
,
in
her
eagerness
,
was
looking
at
any
window
that
caught
her
eye
first
,
to
satisfy
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
then
,
now
you
can
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
say
,
now
,
you
've
seen
Liverpool
Exchange
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
to
be
sure
 
it
's
a
beautiful
window
,
I
'm
sure
.
 
<EOS>
But
are
we
near
the
boats
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
stop
as
I
come
back
,
you
know
;
only
I
think
we
'd
better
get
on
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
the
wind
's
in
your
favour
you
'll
be
down
the
river
in
no
time
,
and
catch
Will
,
I
'll
be
bound
;
and
if
it
's
not
,
why
,
you
know
the
minute
it
took
you
to
look
at
the
Exchange
will
be
neither
here
nor
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Another
rush
onwards
,
till
one
of
the
long
crossings
near
the
Docks
caused
a
stoppage
,
and
gave
Mary
time
for
breathing
,
and
Charley
leisure
to
ask
another
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
never
said
where
you
come
from
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Manchester
,
"
replied
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
then
!
<EOS>
you
've
a
power
of
things
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
Liverpool
beats
<EOS>
Manchester
hollow
,
they
say
.
 
<EOS>
A
nasty
,
smoky
hole
,
<EOS>
bean't
it
?
 
<EOS>
Are
you
bound
to
live
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
!
<EOS>
it
's
my
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
do
n't
think
I
could
abide
a
home
in
the
middle
of
smoke
.
<EOS>
Look
there
!
<EOS>
now
you
see
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
something
now
<EOS>
you
'd
give
a
deal
for
in
Manchester
.
 
<EOS>
Look
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
Mary
did
look
,
and
saw
down
an
opening
made
in
the
forest
of
masts
belonging
to
the
vessels
in
dock
,
the
glorious
river
,
along
which
white
-
sailed
ships
were
gliding
with
the
ensigns
of
all
nations
,
not
"
braving
the
battle
,
"
but
telling
of
the
distant
lands
,
spicy
or
frozen
,
that
sent
to
that
mighty
mart
for
their
comforts
or
their
luxuries
;
she
saw
small
boats
passing
to
and
fro
on
that
glittering
highway
,
but
she
also
saw
such
puffs
and
clouds
of
smoke
from
the
countless
steamers
,
that
she
wondered
at
Charley
's
intolerance
of
the
smoke
of
Manchester
.
 
<EOS>
Across
the
swing
-
bridge
,
along
the
pier
,
 
and
they
stood
breathless
by
a
magnificent
dock
,
where
hundreds
of
ships
lay
motionless
during
the
process
of
loading
and
unloading
.
 
<EOS>
The
cries
of
the
sailors
,
the
variety
of
languages
used
by
the
passers
-
by
,
and
the
entire
novelty
of
the
sight
compared
with
anything
which
Mary
had
ever
seen
,
made
her
feel
most
helpless
and
forlorn
;
and
she
clung
to
her
young
guide
as
to
one
who
alone
by
his
superior
knowledge
could
interpret
between
her
and
the
new
race
of
men
by
whom
she
was
surrounded
,
 
for
a
new
race
sailors
might
reasonably
be
considered
,
to
a
girl
who
had
hitherto
seen
none
but
inland
dwellers
,
and
those
for
the
greater
part
factory
people
.
  
<EOS>
In
that
new
world
of
sight
and
sound
,
she
still
bore
one
prevailing
thought
,
and
though
her
eye
glanced
over
the
ships
and
the
wide
-
spreading
river
,
her
mind
was
full
of
the
thought
of
reaching
Will
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
are
we
here
?
"
<EOS>
asked
she
of
Charley
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
are
no
little
boats
about
,
and
I
thought
I
was
to
go
in
a
little
boat
;
those
ships
are
never
meant
for
short
distances
,
are
they
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
be
sure
not
,
"
replied
he
,
rather
contemptuously
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
John
Cropper
lay
in
this
dock
,
and
I
know
many
of
the
sailors
;
and
if
I
could
see
one
I
knew
,
I
'd
ask
him
to
run
up
the
mast
,
and
see
if
he
could
catch
a
sight
of
her
in
the
offing
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
's
weighed
her
anchor
,
no
use
for
your
going
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
assented
quietly
to
this
speech
,
as
if
she
were
as
careless
as
Charley
seemed
now
to
be
about
her
overtaking
Will
;
but
in
truth
her
heart
was
sinking
within
her
,
and
she
no
longer
felt
the
energy
which
had
hitherto
upheld
her
.
 
<EOS>
Her
bodily
strength
was
giving
way
,
and
she
stood
cold
and
shivering
,
although
the
noonday
sun
beat
down
with
considerable
power
on
the
shadeless
spot
where
she
was
standing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
Tom
Bourne
!
"
said
Charley
;
and
altering
his
manner
from
the
patronising
key
in
which
he
had
spoken
to
Mary
,
he
addressed
a
weather
-
beaten
old
sailor
who
came
rolling
along
the
pathway
where
they
stood
,
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
his
quid
in
his
mouth
,
with
very
much
the
air
of
one
who
had
nothing
to
do
but
look
about
him
,
and
spit
right
and
left
;
addressing
this
old
tar
,
Charley
made
known
to
him
his
wish
in
slang
,
which
to
Mary
was
almost
inaudible
,
and
quite
unintelligible
,
and
which
I
am
too
much
of
a
land
-
lubber
to
repeat
correctly
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
watched
looks
and
actions
with
a
renovated
keenness
of
perception
.
  
<EOS>
She
saw
the
old
man
listen
attentively
to
Charley
;
she
saw
him
eye
her
over
from
head
to
foot
,
and
wind
up
his
inspection
with
a
little
nod
of
approbation
(
for
her
very
shabbiness
and
poverty
of
dress
were
creditable
signs
to
the
experienced
old
sailor
)
,
and
then
she
watched
him
leisurely
swing
himself
on
to
a
ship
in
the
basin
,
and
,
borrowing
a
glass
,
run
up
the
mast
with
the
speed
of
a
monkey
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
fall
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
in
affright
,
clutching
at
Charley
's
arm
,
and
judging
the
sailor
,
from
his
storm
-
marked
face
and
unsteady
walk
on
land
,
to
be
much
older
than
he
really
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
he
!
"
said
Charley
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
at
the
mast
-
head
now
.
 
<EOS>
See
!
<EOS>
he
's
looking
through
his
glass
,
and
using
his
arms
as
steady
as
if
he
were
on
dry
land
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
've
been
up
the
mast
,
many
and
many
a
time
;
only
do
n't
tell
mother
.
 
<EOS>
She
thinks
I
'm
to
be
a
shoemaker
,
but
I
've
made
up
my
mind
to
be
a
sailor
;
only
there
's
no
good
arguing
with
a
woman
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
not
tell
her
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
see
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
she
<EOS>
(
his
secret
was
very
safe
with
her
,
for
,
in
fact
,
she
had
not
heard
it
)
;
"
see
!
<EOS>
he
's
coming
down
;
he
's
down
.
<EOS>
Speak
to
him
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
unable
to
wait
another
instant
,
she
called
out
herself
   
"
<EOS>
Can
you
see
the
John
Cropper
?
 
<EOS>
Is
she
there
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
"
he
answered
,
and
coming
quickly
up
to
them
,
he
hurried
them
away
to
seek
for
a
boat
,
saying
the
bar
was
already
covered
,
and
in
an
hour
the
ship
would
hoist
her
sails
and
be
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
the
wind
right
against
you
,
and
must
use
oars
.
 
<EOS>
No
time
to
lose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
ran
to
some
steps
leading
down
to
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
They
beckoned
to
some
watermen
,
who
,
suspecting
the
real
state
of
the
case
,
appeared
in
no
hurry
for
a
fare
,
but
leisurely
brought
their
boat
alongside
the
stairs
,
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
indifference
to
them
whether
they
were
engaged
or
not
,
while
they
conversed
together
in
few
words
,
and
in
an
undertone
,
respecting
the
charge
they
should
make
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
pray
make
haste
,
"
called
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
take
me
to
the
John
Cropper
.
 
<EOS>
Where
is
she
,
Charley
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
them
 
I
do
n't
rightly
know
the
words
 
only
make
haste
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
offing
she
is
,
sure
enough
,
miss
,
"
answered
one
of
the
men
,
shoving
Charley
on
one
side
,
regarding
him
as
too
young
to
be
a
principal
in
the
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
we
can
go
,
Dick
,
"
said
he
,
with
a
wink
to
his
companion
;
 
<EOS>
"
there
's
the
gentleman
over
at
New
Brighton
as
wants
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
mayhap
,
the
young
woman
will
pay
us
handsome
for
giving
her
a
last
look
at
her
sweetheart
,
"
interposed
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
much
do
you
want
?
 
<EOS>
Only
make
haste
 
<EOS>
I
've
enough
to
pay
you
,
but
every
moment
is
precious
,
"
said
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
that
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
Less
than
an
hour
wo
n't
take
us
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
,
and
she
'll
be
off
by
two

Poor
Mary
's
ideas
of
"
plenty
of
money
,
"
however
,
were
different
to
those
entertained
by
the
boatmen
.
 
<EOS>
Only
fourteen
or
fifteen
shillings
remained
out
of
the
sovereign
Margaret
had
lent
her
,
and
the
boatmen
,
imagining
"
plenty
"
to
mean
no
less
than
several
pounds
,
insisted
upon
receiving
a
sovereign
(
an
exorbitant
fare
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
although
reduced
from
their
first
demand
of
thirty
shillings
)
.
  
<EOS>
While
Charley
,
with
a
boy
's
impatience
of
delay
,
and
disregard
to
money
,
kept
urging
   
<EOS>
"
Give
it
'em
,
Mary
;
they
'll
none
of
them
take
you
for
less
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
your
only
chance
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
St.
Nicholas
ringing
one
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
only
got
fourteen
and
ninepence
,
"
cried
she
in
despair
,
after
counting
over
her
money
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
'll
give
you
my
shawl
,
and
you
can
sell
it
for
four
or
five
shillings
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
wo
n't
that
much
do
?
"
<EOS>
asked
she
,
in
such
a
tone
of
voice
,
that
they
must
indeed
have
had
hard
hearts
who
could
refuse
such
agonised
entreaty
.
  
<EOS>
They
took
her
on
board
.
  
<EOS>
And
in
less
than
five
minutes
she
was
rocking
and
tossing
in
a
boat
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
,
alone
with
two
rough
,
hard
-
looking
men
.

A

<EOS>
Mary
had
not
understood
that
Charley
was
not
coming
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
she
had
not
thought
about
it
,
till
she
perceived
his
absence
,
as
they
pushed
off
from
the
landing
-
place
,
and
remembered
that
she
had
never
thanked
him
for
all
his
kind
interest
in
her
behalf
;
and
now
his
absence
made
her
feel
most
lonely
 
even
his
,
the
little
mushroom
friend
of
an
hour
's
growth
.
  
<EOS>
The
boat
threaded
her
way
through
the
maze
of
larger
vessels
which
surrounded
the
shore
,
bumping
against
one
,
kept
off
by
the
oars
from
going
right
against
another
,
overshadowed
by
a
third
,
until
at
length
they
were
fairly
out
on
the
broad
river
,
away
from
either
shore
;
the
sights
and
sounds
of
land
being
heard
in
the
distance
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
came
a
sort
of
pause
.
  
<EOS>
Both
wind
and
tide
were
against
the
two
men
,
and
labour
as
they
would
they
made
but
little
way
.
 
<EOS>
Once
Mary
in
her
impatience
had
risen
up
to
obtain
a
better
view
of
the
progress
they
had
made
;
but
the
men
had
roughly
told
her
to
sit
down
immediately
,
and
she
had
dropped
on
her
seat
like
a
chidden
child
,
although
the
impatience
was
still
at
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
she
grew
sure
they
were
turning
off
from
the
straight
course
<EOS>
which
they
had
hitherto
kept
on
the
Cheshire
side
of
the
river
,
whither
they
had
gone
to
avoid
the
force
of
the
current
,
and
after
a
short
time
she
could
not
help
naming
her
conviction
,
as
a
kind
of
nightmare
dread
and
belief
came
over
her
,
that
everything
animate
and
inanimate
was
in
league
against
her
one
sole
aim
and
object
of
overtaking
Will
.
  
<EOS>
They
answered
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
They
saw
a
boatman
whom
they
knew
,
and
were
desirous
of
obtaining
his
services
as
a
steersman
,
so
that
both
might
row
with
greater
effect
.
 
<EOS>
They
knew
what
they
were
about
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
sat
silent
with
clenched
hands
while
the
parley
went
on
,
the
explanation
was
given
,
the
favour
asked
and
granted
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
was
sickening
all
the
time
with
nervous
fear
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
been
rowing
a
long
,
long
time
 
half
a
day
it
seemed
,
at
least
 
yet
Liverpool
appeared
still
close
at
hand
,
and
Mary
began
almost
to
wonder
that
the
men
were
not
as
much
disheartened
as
she
was
,
when
the
wind
,
which
had
been
hitherto
against
them
,
dropped
,
and
thin
clouds
began
to
gather
over
the
sky
,
shutting
out
the
sun
,
and
casting
a
chilly
gloom
over
everything
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
breath
of
air
,
and
yet
it
was
colder
than
when
the
soft
violence
of
the
westerly
wind
had
been
felt
.
  
<EOS>
The
men
renewed
their
efforts
.
 
<EOS>
The
boat
gave
a
bound
forwards
at
every
pull
of
the
oars
.
 
<EOS>
The
water
was
glassy
and
motionless
,
reflecting
tint
by
tint
of
the
Indian
-
ink
sky
above
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
shivered
,
and
her
heart
sank
within
her
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
now
they
evidently
were
making
progress
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
steersman
pointed
to
a
rippling
line
on
the
river
only
a
little
way
off
,
and
the
men
disturbed
Mary
,
who
was
watching
the
ships
that
lay
in
what
appeared
to
her
the
open
sea
,
to
get
at
their
sails
.
  
<EOS>
She
gave
a
little
start
,
and
rose
.
 
<EOS>
Her
patience
,
her
grief
,
and
perhaps
her
silence
,
had
begun
to
win
upon
the
men
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yon
second
to
the
norrard
is
the
John
Cropper
.
 
<EOS>
Wind
's
right
now
,
and
sails
will
soon
carry
us
alongside
of
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
forgotten
(
or
perhaps
he
did
not
like
to
remind
Mary
)
that
the
same
wind
which
now
bore
their
little
craft
along
with
easy
,
rapid
motion
,
would
also
be
favourable
to
the
John
Cropper
.
  
<EOS>
But
as
they
looked
with
straining
eyes
,
as
if
to
measure
the
decreasing
distance
that
separated
them
from
her
,
they
saw
her
sails
unfurled
and
flap
in
the
breeze
,
till
,
catching
the
right
point
,
they
bellied
forth
into
white
roundness
,
and
the
ship
began
to
plunge
and
heave
,
as
if
she
were
a
living
creature
,
impatient
to
be
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
heaving
anchor
!
"
said
one
of
the
boatmen
to
the
other
,
as
the
faint
musical
cry
of
the
sailors
came
floating
over
the
waters
that
still
separated
them
.
  
<EOS>
Full
of
the
spirit
of
the
chase
,
though
as
yet
ignorant
of
Mary
's
motives
,
the
men
sprung
to
hoist
another
sail
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
fully
as
much
as
the
boat
could
bear
,
in
the
keen
,
gusty
east
wind
which
was
now
blowing
,
and
she
bent
,
and
laboured
,
and
ploughed
,
and
creaked
upbraidingly
as
if
tasked
beyond
her
strength
;
but
she
sped
along
with
a
gallant
swiftness
.
  
<EOS>
They
drew
nearer
,
and
they
heard
the
distant
"
ahoy
"
more
clearly
.
<EOS>
It
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
The
anchor
was
up
,
and
the
ship
was
away
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
stood
up
,
steadying
herself
by
the
mast
,
and
stretched
out
her
arms
,
imploring
the
flying
vessel
to
stay
its
course
,
by
that
mute
action
,
while
the
tears
streamed
down
her
cheeks
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
caught
up
their
oars
and
hoisted
them
in
the
air
,
and
shouted
to
arrest
attention
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
seen
by
the
men
aboard
the
larger
craft
;
but
they
were
too
busy
with
all
the
confusion
prevalent
in
an
outward
-
bound
vessel
to
pay
much
attention
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
coils
of
ropes
and
seamen
's
chests
to
be
stumbled
over
at
every
turn
;
there
were
animals
,
not
properly
secured
,
roaming
bewildered
about
the
deck
,
adding
their
pitiful
lowings
and
bleatings
to
the
aggregate
of
noises
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
carcases
not
cut
up
,
looking
like
corpses
of
sheep
and
pigs
rather
than
like
mutton
and
pork
;
there
were
sailors
running
here
and
there
and
everywhere
,
having
had
no
time
to
fall
into
method
,
and
with
their
minds
divided
between
thoughts
of
the
land
and
the
people
they
had
left
,
and
the
present
duties
on
board
ship
;
while
the
captain
strove
hard
to
procure
some
kind
of
order
by
hasty
commands
given
in
a
loud
,
impatient
voice
,
to
right
and
left
,
starboard
and
larboard
,
cabin
and
steerage
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
paced
the
deck
with
a
chafed
step
,
vexed
at
one
or
two
little
mistakes
on
the
part
of
the
mate
,
and
suffering
himself
from
the
pain
of
separation
from
wife
and
children
,
but
showing
his
suffering
only
by
his
outward
irritation
,
he
heard
a
hail
from
the
shabby
little
river
boat
that
was
striving
to
overtake
his
winged
ship
.
<EOS>
For
the
men
fearing
that
,
as
the
ship
was
now
fairly
over
the
bar
,
they
should
only
increase
the
distance
between
them
,
and
being
now
within
shouting
range
,
had
asked
of
Mary
her
more
particular
desire
.
  
<EOS>
Her
throat
was
dry
,
all
musical
sound
had
gone
out
of
her
voice
;
but
in
a
loud
,
harsh
whisper
she
told
the
men
her
errand
of
life
and
death
,
and
they
hailed
the
ship
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
're
come
for
one
William
Wilson
,
who
is
wanted
to
prove
an
alibi
in
Liverpool
Assize
Courts
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
James
Wilson
is
to
be
tried
for
a
murder
done
on
Thursday
night
when
he
was
with
William
Wilson
.
<EOS>
Anything
more
,
missis
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
boatman
of
Mary
,
in
a
lower
voice
,
and
taking
his
hands
down
from
his
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
I
'm
Mary
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
ship
is
going
on
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
for
the
love
of
Heaven
,
ask
them
to
stop
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
boatman
was
angry
at
the
little
regard
paid
to
his
summons
,
and
called
out
again
;
repeating
the
message
with
the
name
of
the
young
woman
who
sent
it
,
and
interlarding
it
with
sailors
'
oaths
.
  
<EOS>
The
ship
flew
along
 
away
 
<EOS>
the
boat
struggled
after
.
  
<EOS>
They
could
see
the
captain
take
his
speaking
-
trumpet
.
 
<EOS>
And
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
and
alas
!
<EOS>
they
heard
his
words
.
  
<EOS>
He
swore
a
dreadful
oath
;
he
called
Mary
a
disgraceful
name
!
<EOS>
and
he
said
he
would
not
stop
his
ship
for
any
one
,
nor
could
he
part
with
a
single
hand
,
whoever
swung
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
words
came
in
unpitying
clearness
with
their
trumpet
-
sound
.
<EOS>
Mary
sat
down
looking
like
one
who
prays
in
the
death
agony
.
 
<EOS>
For
her
eyes
were
turned
up
to
that
heaven
,
where
mercy
dwelleth
,
while
her
blue
lips
quivered
,
though
no
sound
came
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
bowed
her
head
,
and
hid
it
in
her
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
yon
sailor
hails
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
up
,
and
her
heart
stopped
its
beating
to
listen
.
  
<EOS>
William
Wilson
stood
as
near
the
stern
of
the
vessel
as
he
could
get
;
and
unable
to
obtain
the
trumpet
from
the
angry
captain
,
made
a
tube
of
his
own
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
help
me
God
,
Mary
Barton
,
I
'll
come
back
in
the
pilot
-
boat
time
enough
to
save
the
life
of
the
innocent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
he
say
?
"
asked
Mary
wildly
,
as
the
voice
died
away
in
the
increasing
distance
,
while
the
boatmen
cheered
,
in
their
kindled
sympathy
with
their
passenger
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
he
say
?
"
repeated
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
heard
with
her
ears
,
but
her
brain
refused
to
recognise
the
sense
.
  
<EOS>
They
repeated
his
speech
,
all
three
speaking
at
once
,
with
many
comments
;
while
Mary
looked
at
them
and
then
at
the
vessel
far
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
rightly
know
about
it
,
"
said
she
sorrowfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
pilot
-
boat
?
"
  
<EOS>
They
told
her
,
and
she
gathered
the
meaning
out
of
the
sailors
'
slang
which
enveloped
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
hope
still
,
although
so
slight
and
faint
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
far
does
the
pilot
go
with
the
ship
?
"
  
<EOS>
To
different
distances
,
they
said
.
 
<EOS>
Some
pilots
would
go
as
far
as
Holyhead
for
the
chance
of
the
homeward
-
bound
vessels
;
others
only
took
the
ships
over
the
Banks
.
 
<EOS>
Some
captains
were
more
cautious
than
others
,
and
the
pilots
had
different
ways
.
 
<EOS>
The
wind
was
against
the
homeward
-
bound
vessels
,
so
perhaps
the
pilot
aboard
the
John
Cropper
would
not
care
to
go
far
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
soon
would
he
come
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
were
three
boatmen
,
and
three
opinions
,
varying
from
twelve
hours
to
two
days
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
man
who
gave
his
vote
for
the
longest
time
,
on
having
his
judgment
disputed
,
grew
stubborn
,
and
doubled
the
time
,
and
thought
it
might
be
the
end
of
the
week
before
the
pilot
-
boat
came
home
.
  
<EOS>
They
began
disputing
and
urging
reasons
;
and
Mary
tried
to
understand
them
;
but
independently
of
their
nautical
language
,
a
veil
seemed
drawn
over
her
mind
,
and
she
had
no
clear
perception
of
anything
that
passed
.
 
<EOS>
Her
very
words
seemed
not
her
own
,
and
beyond
her
power
of
control
,
for
she
found
herself
speaking
quite
differently
to
what
she
meant
.
  
<EOS>
One
by
one
<EOS>
her
hopes
had
fallen
away
,
and
left
her
desolate
;
and
though
a
chance
yet
remained
,
she
could
no
longer
hope
.
 
<EOS>
She
felt
certain
it
,
too
,
would
fade
and
vanish
.
 
<EOS>
She
sank
into
a
kind
of
stupor
.
 
<EOS>
All
outward
objects
harmonised
with
her
despair
 
<EOS>
the
gloomy
leaden
sky
 
<EOS>
the
deep
dark
waters
below
,
of
a
still
heavier
shade
of
colour
 
<EOS>
the
cold
,
flat
yellow
shore
in
the
distance
,
which
no
ray
lightened
up
 
the
nipping
,
cutting
wind
.
  
<EOS>
She
shivered
with
her
depression
of
mind
and

The
sails
were
taken
down
,
of
course
,
on
the
return
to
Liverpool
,
and
the
progress
they
made
,
rowing
and
tacking
,
was
very
slow
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
talked
together
,
disputing
about
the
pilots
at
first
,
and
then
about
matters
of
local
importance
,
in
which
Mary
would
have
taken
no
interest
at
any
time
,
and
she
gradually
became
drowsy
;
<EOS>
irrepressibly
so
,
indeed
,
for
in
spite
of
her
jerking
efforts
to
keep
awake
,
she
sank
away
to
the
bottom
of
the
boat
,
and
there
lay
crouched
on
a
rough
heap
of
sails
,
rope
,
and
tackles
of
various
kinds
.
  
<EOS>
The
measured
beat
of
the
waters
against
the
sides
of
the
boat
,
and
the
musical
boom
of
the
more
distant
waves
,
were
more
lulling
than
silence
,
and
she
slept
sound
.
  
<EOS>
Once
she
opened
her
eyes
heavily
,
and
dimly
saw
the
old
grey
,
rough
boatman
(
who
had
stood
out
the
most
obstinately
for
the
full
fare
)
covering
her
with
his
thick
pea
-
jacket
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
taken
it
off
on
purpose
,
and
was
doing
it
tenderly
in
his
way
,
but
before
she
could
rouse
herself
up
to
thank
him
she
had
dropped
off
to
sleep
again
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
in
the
dusk
of
evening
,
they
arrived
at
the
landing
-
place
from
which
they
had
started
some
hours
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
spoke
to
Mary
,
but
though
she
mechanically
replied
,
she
did
not
stir
;
so
,
at
length
,
they
were
obliged
to
shake
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
stood
up
,
shivering
and
puzzled
as
to
her
whereabouts
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
tell
me
where
you
are
bound
to
,
missus
,
"
said
the
grey
old
man
,
"
and
maybe
I
can
put
you
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
slowly
comprehended
what
he
said
,
and
went
through
the
process
of
recollection
;
but
very
dimly
,
and
with
much
labour
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
her
hand
into
her
pocket
and
pulled
out
her
purse
,
and
shook
its
contents
into
the
man
's
hand
;
and
then
began
meekly
to
unpin
her
shawl
,
although
they
had
turned
away
without
asking
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
no
!
"
said
the
old
man
,
who
lingered
on
the
step
before
springing
into
the
boat
,
and
to
whom
she
mutely
offered
the
shawl
.
<EOS>
"
Keep
it
!
<EOS>
we
donnot
want
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
were
only
for
to
try
you
,
 
<EOS>
some
folks
say
they
've
no
more
blunt
,
when
all
the
while
they
've
getten
a
mint
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
she
,
in
a
dull
,
low
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
bound
to
?
 
<EOS>
I
axed
that
question
afore
,
"
said
the
gruff
old
fellow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
stranger
,
"
replied
she
quietly
,
with
a
strange
absence
of
anxiety
under
the
circumstances
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
you
mun
find
out
then
,
"
said
he
sharply
:
<EOS>
"
pier
-
head
's
no
place
for
a
young
woman
to
be
standing
on
,
gapeseying
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
a
card
somewhere
as
will
tell
me
,
"
she
answered
,
and
the
man
,
partly
relieved
,
jumped
into
the
boat
,
which
was
now
pushing
off
to
make
way
for
the
arrivals
from
some
steamer
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
felt
in
her
pocket
for
the
card
,
on
which
was
written
the
name
of
the
street
where
she
was
to
have
met
Mr.
Bridgnorth
at
two
o'clock
;
where
Job
and
Mrs.
Wilson
were
to
have
been
,
and
where
she
was
to
have
learnt
from
the
former
the
particulars
of
some
respectable
lodging
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
to
be
found
.
  
<EOS>
She
tried
to
brighten
her
perceptions
,
and
felt
again
,
and
took
out
the
little
articles
her
pocket
contained
,
her
empty
purse
,
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
and
such
little
things
,
but
it
was
not
there
.
  
<EOS>
In
fact
,
she
had
dropped
it
when
,
so
eager
to
embark
,
she
had
pulled
out
her
purse
to
reckon
up
her
money
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
know
this
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
She
only
knew
it
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
It
added
but
little
to
the
despair
that
was
creeping
over
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
tried
a
little
more
to
help
herself
,
though
every
minute
her
mind
became
more
cloudy
.
 
<EOS>
She
strove
to
remember
where
Will
had
lodged
,
but
she
could
not
;
name
,
street
,
everything
had
passed
away
,
and
it
did
not
signify
;
better
she
were
lost
than
found
.
  
<EOS>
She
sat
down
quietly
on
the
top
step
of
the
landing
,
and
gazed
down
into
the
dark
,
dank
water
below
.
 
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
a
spectral
thought
loomed
among
the
shadows
of
her
brain
;
a
wonder
whether
beneath
that
cold
dismal
surface
there
would
not
be
rest
from
the
troubles
of
earth
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
could
not
hold
an
idea
before
her
for
two
consecutive
moments
;
and
she
forgot
what
she
thought
about
before
she
could
act
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
So
she
continued
sitting
motionless
,
without
looking
up
,
or
regarding
in
any
way
the
insults
to
which
she
was
subjected
.
  
<EOS>
Through
the
darkening
light
the
old
boatman
had
watched
her
:
interested
in
her
in
spite
of
himself
,
and
his
scoldings
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
landing
-
place
was
once
more
comparatively
clear
,
he
made
his
way
towards
it
,
across
boats
,
and
along
planks
,
swearing
at
himself
while
he
did
so
for
an
old
fool
.
  
<EOS>
He
shook
Mary
's
shoulder
violently
.
  
<EOS>
"
D
#
#
#
#
you
<EOS>
,
I
ask
you
again
where
you
're
bound
to
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
sit
there
,
stupid
.
 
<EOS>
Where
are
going
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
sighed
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
;
avast
with
that
story
.
 
<EOS>
You
said
a
bit
ago
you
'd
a
card
,
which
was
to
tell
you
where
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
,
but
I
've
lost
it
.
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
again
down
upon
the
black
mirror
below
.
  
<EOS>
He
stood
by
her
,
striving
to
put
down
his
better
self
;
but
he
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
shook
her
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
up
,
as
if
she
had
forgotten
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
?
"
asked
she
wearily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
with
me
and
be
d####d
to
you
!
"
<EOS>
replied
he
,
clutching
her
arm
to
pull
her
up
.
  
<EOS>
She
arose
and
followed
him
,
with
the
unquestioning
docility
of
a
little
child
.

<EOS>
At
five
minutes
before
two
,
Job
Legh
stood
upon
the
doorstep
of
the
house
where
Mr.
Bridgnorth
lodged
at
Assize
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
left
Mrs.
Wilson
at
the
dwelling
of
a
friend
of
his
,
who
had
offered
him
a
room
for
the
old
woman
and
Mary
:
a
room
which
had
frequently
been
his
,
on
his
occasional
visits
to
Liverpool
,
but
which
he
was
thankful
now
to
have
obtained
for
them
,
as
his
own
sleeping
place
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
,
and
the
town
appeared
crowded
and
disorderly
on
the
eve
of
the
Assizes
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
shown
in
to
Mr.
Bridgnorth
,
who
was
writing
;
Mary
and
Will
Wilson
had
not
yet
arrived
,
being
,
as
you
know
,
far
away
on
the
broad
sea
;
but
of
this
Job
of
course
knew
nothing
,
and
he
did
not
as
yet
feel
much
anxiety
about
their
non
-
appearance
;
he
was
more
curious
to
know
the
result
of
Mr.
Bridgnorth
's
interview
that
morning
with
Jem
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
"
said
Mr.
Bridgnorth
,
putting
down
his
pen
,
"
I
have
seen
him
,
but
to
little
purpose
,
I
'm
afraid
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
very
impracticable
 
very
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
,
of
course
,
that
he
must
be
perfectly
open
with
me
,
or
else
I
could
not
be
prepared
for
the
weak
points
.
 
<EOS>
I
named
your
name
with
the
view
of
unlocking
his
confidence
,
but
"
    
"
What
did
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Job
breathlessly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
very
little
.
 
<EOS>
He
barely
answered
me
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
refused
to
answer
some
questions
 
positively
refused
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
I
can
do
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
think
him
guilty
,
sir
?
"
said
Job
despondingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
n't
,
"
replied
Mr.
Bridgnorth
,
quickly
and
decisively
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Much
less
than
I
did
before
I
saw
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
impression
(
mind
,
'
tis
only
impression
;
I
rely
upon
your
caution
,
not
to
take
it
for
fact
)
  
the
impression
,
"
with
an
emphasis
on
the
word
,
"
he
gave
me
is
,
that
he
knows
something
about
the
affair
,
but
what
,
he
will
not
say
;
and
so
the
chances
are
,
if
he
persists
in
his
obstinacy
,
he
'll
be
hung
.
<EOS>
That
's
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
began
to
write
again
,
for
he
had
no
time
to
lose
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
must
not
be
hung
,
"
said
Job
with
vehemence
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bridgnorth
looked
up
,
smiled
a
little
,
but
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
say
,
sir
,
if
I
may
be
so
bold
as
to
ask
?
"
<EOS>
continued
Job
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
words
were
few
enough
,
and
he
was
so
reserved
and
short
,
that
,
as
I
said
before
,
I
can
only
give
you
the
impression
they
conveyed
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
,
of
course
,
who
I
was
,
and
for
what
I
was
sent
.
<EOS>
He
looked
pleased
<EOS>
,
I
thought
 
at
least
his
face
(
sad
enough
when
I
went
in
<EOS>
,
I
assure
ye
)
<EOS>
brightened
a
little
;
but
he
said
he
had
nothing
to
say
,
no
defence
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
him
if
he
was
guilty
,
then
;
and
,
by
way
of
opening
his
heart
,
I
said
I
understood
he
had
had
provocation
enough
,
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
I
heard
that
the
girl
was
very
lovely
and
had
jilted
him
to
fall
desperately
in
love
with
that
handsome
young
Carson
(
poor
fellow
!
)
.
 
<EOS>
But
James
Wilson
did
not
speak
one
way
or
another
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
went
to
particulars
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
him
if
the
gun
was
his
,
as
his
mother
had
declared
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
heard
of
her
admission
<EOS>
,
it
was
evident
,
from
his
quick
way
of
looking
up
,
and
the
glance
of
his
eye
;
but
when
he
saw
I
was
observing
him
,
he
hung
down
his
head
again
,
and
merely
said
she
was
right
;
it
was
his
gun
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
"
said
Job
impatiently
,
as
Mr.
Bridgnorth
paused
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
little
more
to
tell
you
,
"
continued
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
I
asked
him
to
inform
me
,
in
all
confidence
,
how
it
came
to
be
found
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
silent
for
a
time
,
and
then
refused
.
 
<EOS>
Not
only
refused
to
answer
that
question
,
but
candidly
told
me
he
would
not
say
another
word
on
the
subject
,
and
,
thanking
me
for
my
trouble
and
interest
in
his
behalf
,
he
all
but
dismissed
me
.
 
<EOS>
Ungracious
enough
on
the
whole
,
was
it
not
,
Mr.
Legh
?
 
<EOS>
And
yet
,
I
assure
ye
,
<EOS>
I
am
twenty
times
more
inclined
to
think
him
innocent
than
before
I
had
the
interview
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
Mary
Barton
would
come
,
"
said
Job
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
and
Will
are
a
long
time
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
that
's
our
only
chance
,
I
believe
,
"
answered
Mr.
Bridgnorth
,
who
was
writing
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
sent
Johnson
off
before
twelve
to
serve
him
with
his
sub
-
poena
,
and
to
say
I
wanted
to
speak
with
him
;
he
'll
be
here
soon
,
<EOS>
I
've
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bridgnorth
looked
up
again
,
and
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Duncombe
promised
to
be
here
to
speak
to
his
character
.
 
<EOS>
I
sent
him
a
sub
-
poena
on
Saturday
night
.
 
<EOS>
Though
,
after
all
,
juries
go
very
little
by
such
general
and
vague
testimony
as
that
to
character
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
right
that
they
should
not
often
;
but
in
this
instance
unfortunate
for
us
,
as
we
must
rest
our
case
on
the
alibi
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
pen
went
again
,
scratch
,
scratch
over
the
paper
.
  
<EOS>
Job
grew
very
fidgety
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
,
the
more
readily
to
start
up
when
Will
and
Mary
should
appear
.
 
<EOS>
He
listened
intently
to
every
noise
and
every
step
on
the
stair
.
  
<EOS>
Once
he
heard
a
man
's
footstep
,
and
his
old
heart
gave
a
leap
of
delight
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
only
Mr.
Bridgnorth
's
clerk
,
bringing
him
a
list
of
those
cases
in
which
the
grand
jury
had
found
true
bills
.
<EOS>
He
glanced
it
over
and
pushed
it
to
Job
,
merely
saying
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
we
expected
this
,
"
and
went
on
with
his
writing
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
true
bill
against
James
Wilson
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
Job
felt
now
doubly
anxious
and
sad
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
the
beginning
of
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
got
,
by
imperceptible
degrees
,
to
think
Jem
innocent
.
<EOS>
Little
by
little
this
persuasion
had
come
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
(
tossing
about
in
the
little
boat
on
the
broad
river
)
did
not
come
,
nor
did
Will
.
  
<EOS>
Job
grew
very
restless
.
 
<EOS>
He
longed
to
go
and
watch
for
them
out
of
the
window
,
but
feared
to
interrupt
Mr.
Bridgnorth
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
his
desire
to
look
out
was
irresistible
,
and
he
got
up
and
walked
carefully
and
gently
across
the
room
,
his
boots
creaking
at
every
cautious
step
.
 
<EOS>
The
gloom
which
had
overspread
the
sky
,
and
the
influence
of
which
had
been
felt
by
Mary
on
the
open
water
,
was
yet
more
perceptible
in
the
dark
,
dull
street
.
 
<EOS>
Job
grew
more
and
more
fidgety
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
obliged
to
walk
about
the
room
,
for
he
could
not
keep
still
;
and
he
did
so
,
regardless
of
Mr.
Bridgnorth
's
impatient
little
motions
and
noises
,
as
the
slow
,
stealthy
,
creaking
movements
were
heard
,
backwards
and
forwards
,
behind
his
chair
.
  
<EOS>
He
really
liked
Job
,
and
was
interested
for
Jem
,
else
his
nervousness
would
have
overcome
his
sympathy
long
before
it
did
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
hold
out
no
longer
against
the
monotonous
,
grating
sound
;
so
at
last
he
threw
down
his
pen
,
locked
his
portfolio
,
and
taking
up
his
hat
and
gloves
,
he
told
Job
he
must
go
to
the
courts
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
Will
Wilson
is
not
come
,
"
said
Job
in
dismay
.
 
<EOS>
"
Just
wait
while
I
run
to
his
lodgings
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
done
it
before
,
but
I
thought
they
'd
be
here
every
minute
,
and
I
were
afraid
of
missing
them
.
<EOS>
I
'll
be
back
in
no
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
good
fellow
,
I
really
must
go
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
begin
to
think
Johnson
must
have
made
a
mistake
,
and
have
fixed
with
this
William
Wilson
to
meet
me
at
the
courts
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
like
to
wait
for
him
here
,
pray
make
use
of
my
room
;
but
I
've
a
notion
I
shall
find
him
there
:
in
which
case
,
I
'll
send
him
to
your
lodging
;
shall
I
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
where
to
find
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
here
again
by
eight
o'clock
,
and
with
the
evidence
of
this
witness
that
's
to
prove
the
alibi
,
I
'll
have
the
brief
drawn
out
,
and
in
the
hands
of
counsel
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
saying
he
shook
hands
with
Job
,
and
went
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
considered
for
a
minute
as
he
lingered
at
the
door
,
and
then
bent
his
steps
towards
Mrs.
Jones
's
,
where
he
knew
(
from
reference
to
queer
,
odd
,
heterogeneous
memoranda
,
in
an
ancient
black
-
leather
pocket
-
book
)
that
Will
lodged
,
and
where
he
doubted
not
he
should
hear
both
of
him
and
of
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
there
,
and
gathered
what
intelligence
he
could
out
of
Mrs.
Jones
's
slow
replies
.
  
<EOS>
He
asked
if
a
young
woman
had
been
there
that
morning
,
and
if
she
had
seen
Will
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
bless
you
,
'cause
he
had
sailed
some
hours
before
she
came
asking
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
dead
silence
,
broken
only
by
the
even
,
heavy
sound
of
Mrs.
Jones
's
ironing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
young
woman
now
?
"
asked
Job
.
  
<EOS>
"
Somewhere
down
at
the
docks
,
"
she
thought
.
 
<EOS>
"
Charley
would
know
,
if
he
was
in
,
but
he
was
n't
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
mischief
,
somewhere
or
other
,
she
had
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
Boys
always
were
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
break
his
neck
some
day
,
she
knew
"
;
<EOS>
so
saying
,
she
quietly
spat
upon
her
fresh
iron
,
to
test
its
heat
,
and
then
went
on
with
her
business
.
  
<EOS>
Job
could
have
boxed
her
,
he
was
in
such
a
state
of
irritation
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
,
and
he
had
his
reward
.
 
<EOS>
Charley
came
in
,
whistling
with
an
air
of
indifference
,
assumed
to
carry
off
his
knowledge
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
to
which
he
had
lingered
about
the
docks
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
<EOS>
an
old
man
come
to
know
where
the
young
woman
is
who
went
out
with
thee
this
morning
,
"
said
his
mother
,
after
she
had
bestowed
on
him
a
little
motherly
scolding
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
she
is
now
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
her
last
sailing
down
the
river
after
the
John
Cropper
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
<EOS>
afeard
she
wo
n't
reach
her
;
wind
changed
,
and
she
would
be
under
weigh
,
and
over
the
bar
in
no
time
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
been
back
by
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
took
Job
some
little
time
to
understand
this
,
from
the
confused
use
of
the
feminine
pronoun
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
inquired
how
he
could
best
find
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
run
down
again
to
the
pier
,
"
said
the
boy
;
"
I
'll
warrant
I
'll
find
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
shalt
do
no
such
a
thing
,
"
said
his
mother
,
setting
her
back
against
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
The
lad
made
a
comical
face
at
Job
,
which
met
with
no
responsive
look
from
the
old
man
,
whose
sympathies
were
naturally
in
favour
of
the
parent
:
although
he
would
thankfully
have
availed
himself
of
Charley
's
offer
;
for
he
was
weary
,
and
anxious
to
return
to
poor
Mrs.
Wilson
,
who
would
be
wondering
what
had
become
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
best
find
her
?
 
<EOS>
Who
did
she
go
with
,
lad
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Charley
was
sullen
at
his
mother
's
exercise
of
authority
before
a
stranger
,
and
at
that
stranger
's
grave
looks
when
he
meant
to
have
made
him
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
were
river
boatmen
;
 
that
's
all
I
know
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
was
the
name
of
their
boat
?
"
<EOS>
persevered
Job
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
took
no
notice
;
the
Anne
,
or
William
,
 
or
some
of
them
common
names
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
pier
did
she
start
from
?
"
asked
Job
despairingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
as
for
that
matter
,
it
were
the
stairs
on
the
Prince
's
Pier
she
started
from
;
but
she
'll
not
come
back
to
the
same
,
for
the
American
steamer
came
up
with
the
tide
,
and
anchored
close
to
it
,
blocking
up
the
way
for
all
the
smaller
craft
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
rough
evening
,
too
,
to
be
out
on
,
"
he
maliciously
added
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
God
's
will
be
done
!
 
<EOS>
I
did
hope
we
could
have
saved
the
lad
,
"
said
Job
sorrowfully
;
<EOS>
"
but
I
'm
getten
very
doubtful
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
uneasy
about
Mary
,
too
,
 
very
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
a
stranger
in
Liverpool
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
she
told
me
,
"
said
Charley
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
traps
about
for
young
women
at
every
corner
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
pity
<EOS>
she
's
no
one
to
meet
her
when
she
lands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
for
that
,
"
replied
Job
,
"
I
do
n't
see
how
any
one
could
meet
her
when
we
ca
n't
tell
where
she
would
come
to
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
trust
to
her
coming
right
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
getten
spirit
and
sense
.
 
<EOS>
She
'll
most
likely
be
for
coming
here
again
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
do
n't
know
what
else
she
can
do
,
for
she
knows
no
other
place
in
Liverpool
.
 
<EOS>
Missus
,
if
she
comes
,
will
you
give
your
son
leave
to
bring
her
to
No
.
8
,
Back
Garden
Court
,
where
there
's
friends
waiting
for
her
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
give
him
sixpence
for
his
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jones
,
pleased
with
the
reference
to
her
,
gladly
promised
.
 
<EOS>
And
even
Charley
,
indignant
as
he
was
at
first
at
the
idea
of
his
motions
being
under
the
control
of
his
mother
,
was
mollified
at
the
prospect
of
the
sixpence
,
and
at
the
probability
of
getting
nearer
to
the
heart
of
the
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mary
never
came
.
   
<EOS>
JOB
LEGH
'S
<EOS>
DECEPTION
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
sad
is
the
night
-
time
,
The
night
-
time
of
sorrow
,
When
through
the
deep
gloom
,
we
catch
but
the
boom
Of
the
waves
that
may
whelm
us
to
-
morrow
.
"
  
<EOS>
Job
found
Mrs.
Wilson
pacing
about
in
a
restless
way
;
not
speaking
to
the
woman
at
whose
house
she
was
staying
,
but
occasionally
heaving
such
deep
oppressive
sighs
as
quite
startled
those
around
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
she
,
turning
sharp
round
in
her
tottering
walk
up
and
down
as
Job
came
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
speak
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
she
,
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
what
to
say
;
for
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
he
was
studying
for
some
kind
-
hearted
lie
which
might
soothe
her
for
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
the
real
state
of
the
case
came
blurting
forth
in
answer
to
her
impatient
questioning
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
's
not
to
the
fore
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
'll
maybe
turn
up
yet
,
time
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
steadily
for
a
minute
,
as
if
almost
doubting
if
such
despair
could
be
in
store
for
her
as
his
words
seemed
to
imply
.
<EOS>
Then
she
slowly
shook
her
head
,
and
said
,
more
quietly
than
might
have
been
expected
from
her
previous
excited
manner
   
"
Do
n't
go
for
to
say
that
!
 
<EOS>
Thou
dost
not
think
it
.
 
<EOS>
Thou'rt
well
-
nigh
hopeless
,
like
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
seed
all
along
my
lad
<EOS>
would
be
hung
for
what
he
never
did
.
 
<EOS>
And
better
he
were
,
and
were
shut
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
of
this
weary
world
,
where
there
's
neither
justice
nor
mercy
left
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
She
looked
up
with
tranced
eyes
as
if
praying
,
and
then
sat
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
now
thou'rt
off
at
a
gallop
,
"
said
Job
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
has
sailed
this
morning
,
for
sure
;
but
that
brave
wench
,
Mary
Barton
,
is
after
him
,
and
will
bring
him
back
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
if
she
can
but
get
speech
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
not
back
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
hold
up
thy
head
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
all
end
right

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
all
end
right
,
"
echoed
she
;
"
but
not
as
thou
tak'st
it
.
<EOS>
Jem
will
be
hung
,
and
will
go
to
his
father
and
the
little
lads
,
where
the
Lord
God
wipes
away
all
tears
,
and
where
the
Lord
Jesus
speaks
kindly
to
the
little
ones
,
who
look
about
for
the
mothers
they
left
upon
earth
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
,
Job
,
yon
's
a
blessed
land
,
and
I
long
to
go
to
it
,
<EOS>
and
yet
I
fret
because
Jem
is
hastening
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
fret
if
he
and
I
could
lie
down
to
-
night
to
sleep
our
last
sleep
;
not
a
bit
would
I
fret
if
folk
would
but
know
him
to
be
innocent
 
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
'll
know
it
sooner
or
later
,
and
repent
sore
if
they
've
hanged
him
for
what
he
never
did
,
"
replied
Job
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
that
they
will
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
souls
!
 
<EOS>
May
God
have
mercy
on
them
when
they
find
out
their
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Presently
Job
grew
tired
of
sitting
waiting
,
and
got
up
,
and
hung
about
the
door
and
window
,
like
some
animal
wanting
to
go
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
pitch
dark
,
for
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
just
go
to
bed
,
"
said
he
to
the
widow
;
"
you
'll
want
your
strength
for
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
will
be
sadly
off
,
if
he
sees
you
<EOS>
so
cut
up
as
you
look
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
step
down
again
and
find
Mary
.
<EOS>
She
'll
be
back
by
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
come
and
tell
you
everything
,
never
fear
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
,
you
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Thou'rt
a
kind
friend
,
Job
Legh
,
and
I
'll
go
,
as
thou
wishest
me
.
<EOS>
But
,
oh
!
mind
thou
com'st
straight
off
to
me
,
and
bring
Mary
as
soon
as
thou'st
lit
on
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
spoke
low
,
but
very
calmly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Job
,
slipping
out
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
first
to
Mr.
Bridgnorth
's
,
where
it
had
struck
him
that
Will
and
Mary
might
be
all
this
time
waiting
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
not
there
,
however
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bridgnorth
had
just
come
in
,
and
Job
went
breathlessly
upstairs
to
consult
with
him
as
to
the
state
of
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
bad
job
,
"
said
the
lawyer
,
looking
very
grave
,
while
he
arranged
his
papers
.
 
<EOS>
"
Johnson
told
me
how
it
was
;
the
woman
that
Wilson
lodged
with
told
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
's
but
<EOS>
a
wildgoose
chase
of
the
girl
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
Our
case
must
rest
on
the
uncertainty
of
circumstantial
evidence
,
and
the
goodness
of
the
prisoner
's
previous
character
.
 
<EOS>
A
very
vague
and
weak
defence
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
've
engaged
Mr.
Clinton
as
counsel
,
and
he
'll
make
the
best
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
good
fellow
,
I
must
wish
you
good
-
night
,
and
turn
you
out
of
doors
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
I
shall
have
to
sit
up
into
the
small
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
see
my
clerk
as
you
came
upstairs
?
 
<EOS>
You
did
!
 
<EOS>
Then
may
I
trouble
you
to
ask
him
to
step
up
immediately
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
this
Job
could
not
stay
,
and
,
making
his
humble
bow
,
he
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Then
he
went
to
Mrs.
Jones
's
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
in
,
but
Charley
had
slipped
off
again
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
holding
that
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
kept
him
but
lock
and
key
,
and
they
did
not
always
;
for
once
she
had
him
locked
up
in
the
garret
,
and
he
had
got
off
through
the
skylight
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
now
he
was
gone
to
see
after
the
young
woman
down
at
the
docks
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
wanted
an
excuse
to
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
Unasked
,
Job
took
a
chair
,
resolved
to
wait
Charley
's
reappearance
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jones
ironed
and
folded
her
clothes
,
talking
all
the
time
of
Charley
and
her
husband
,
who
was
a
sailor
in
some
ship
bound
for
India
,
and
who
,
in
leaving
her
their
boy
,
had
evidently
left
her
rather
more
than
she
could
manage
.
 
<EOS>
She
moaned
and
croaked
over
sailors
,
and
seaport
towns
,
and
stormy
weather
,
and
sleepless
nights
,
and
trousers
all
over
tar
and
pitch
,
long
after
Job
had
left
off
attending
to
her
,
and
was
only
trying
to
hearken
to
every
step
and
every
voice
in
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
Charley
came
in
,
but
he
came
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yon
Mary
Barton
has
getten
into
some
scrape
or
another
,
"
said
he
,
addressing
himself
to
Job
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
not
to
be
heard
of
at
any
of
the
piers
;
and
Bourne
says
it
were
a
boat
from
the
Cheshire
side
as
she
went
aboard
of
.
 
<EOS>
So
there
's
no
hearing
of
her
till
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
-
morrow
morning
she
'll
have
to
be
in
court
at
nine
o'clock
,
to
bear
witness
on
a
trial
,
"
said
Job
sorrowfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
she
said
;
at
least
somewhat
of
the
kind
,
"
said
Charley
,
looking
desirous
to
hear
more
.
 
<EOS>
But
Job
was
silent
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
think
of
anything
further
that
could
be
done
;
so
he
rose
up
,
and
,
thanking
Mrs.
Jones
for
the
shelter
she
had
given
him
<EOS>
,
he
went
out
into
the
street
;
and
there
he
stood
still
,
to
ponder
over
probabilities
and
chances
.
  
<EOS>
After
some
little
time
he
slowly
turned
towards
the
lodging
where
he
had
left
Mrs.
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
;
but
he
loitered
on
the
way
,
fervently
hoping
that
her
weariness
and
her
woes
might
have
sent
her
to
sleep
before
his
return
,
that
he
might
be
spared
her
questionings
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
very
gently
into
the
house
-
place
where
the
sleepy
landlady
awaited
his
coming
and
his
bringing
the
girl
,
who
,
she
had
been
told
,
was
to
share
the
old
woman
's
bed
.
  
<EOS>
But
in
her
sleepy
blindness
she
knocked
things
so
about
in
lighting
the
candle
<EOS>
(
she
could
see
to
have
a
nap
by
firelight
,
she
said
)
,
that
the
voice
of
Mrs.
Wilson
was
heard
from
the
little
back
-
room
,
where
she
was
to
pass
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
Job
gave
no
answer
,
and
kept
down
his
breath
,
that
she
might
think
herself
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
The
landlady
,
having
no
such
care
,
dropped
the
snuffers
with
a
sharp
metallic
sound
,
and
then
,
by
her
endless
apologies
,
convinced
the
listening
woman
that
Job
had
returned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Job
!
 
<EOS>
Job
Legh
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cried
out
nervously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
dear
!
"
said
Job
to
himself
,
going
reluctantly
to
her
bedroom
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
if
one
little
lie
would
be
a
sin
,
as
things
stand
?
<EOS>
It
would
happen
give
her
sleep
,
and
she
wo
n't
have
sleep
for
many
and
many
a
night
(
not
to
call
sleep
)
,
if
things
goes
wrong
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
chance
it
,
any
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Job
!
<EOS>
art
thou
there
?
<EOS>
"
asked
she
again
with
a
trembling
impatience
that
told
in
every
tone
of
her
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
sure
!
 
<EOS>
I
thought
thou'd
ha
'
been
asleep
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Asleep
!
 
<EOS>
How
could
I
sleep
till
<EOS>
I
know'd
<EOS>
if
Will
were
found
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
for
it
,
"
muttered
Job
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Then
in
a
louder
voice
,
"
Never
fear
!
<EOS>
he
's
found
,
and
safe
,
ready
for
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
'll
prove
that
thing
for
my
poor
lad
,
will
he
?
 
<EOS>
He
'll
bear
witness
that
Jem
were
with
him
?
 
<EOS>
O
Job
,
speak
!
<EOS>
tell
me
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
for
a
penny
,
in
for
a
pound
,
"
thought
Job
.
 
<EOS>
"
Happen
one
prayer
will
do
for
the
sum
total
.
 
<EOS>
Any
rate
,
I
must
go
on
now
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
ay
,
"
shouted
he
,
through
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
can
prove
all
;
and
Jem
will
come
off
as
clear
as
a
new
-
born
babe
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
could
hear
Mrs.
Wilson
's
rustling
movements
,
and
in
an
instant
guessed
she
was
on
her
knees
,
for
he
heard
her
trembling
voice
uplifted
in
thanksgiving
and
praise
to
God
,
stopped
at
times
by
sobs
of
gladness
and
relief
.
  
<EOS>
And
when
he
heard
this
,
his
heart
misgave
him
;
for
he
thought
of
the
awful
enlightening
,
the
terrible
revulsion
of
feeling
that
awaited
her
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
the
shortsightedness
of
falsehood
;
but
what
could
he
do
now
?
  
<EOS>
While
he
listened
,
she
ended
her
grateful
prayers
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
Mary
?
 
<EOS>
Thou'st
found
her
at
Mrs.
Jones
's
,
Job
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
continuing
her
inquiries
.
  
<EOS>
He
gave
a
great
sigh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
she
was
there
,
safe
enough
,
second
time
of
going
.
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
me
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
he
,
"
who
'd
ha
'
thought
of
my
turning
out
such
an
arrant
liar
in
my
old
days
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
the
wench
!
 
<EOS>
Is
she
here
?
 
<EOS>
Why
does
she
not
come
to
bed
?
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
she
's
need
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Job
coughed
away
his
remains
of
conscience
,
and
made
answer
   
<EOS>
"
She
was
a
bit
weary
,
and
o'erdone
with
her
sail
!
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Jones
axed
her
to
stay
there
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
nigh
at
hand
to
the
courts
,
where
she
will
have
to
be
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
comes
easy
enough
after
a
while
,
"
groaned
out
Job
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
father
of
lies
helps
one
,
I
suppose
,
for
now
my
speech
comes
as
natural
as
truth
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
done
questioning
now
<EOS>
,
that
's
one
good
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
be
off
,
before
Satan
<EOS>
and
she
are
at
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
went
to
the
house
-
place
,
where
the
landlady
stood
wearily
waiting
.
 
<EOS>
Her
husband
was
in
bed
,
and
asleep
long
ago
.
  
<EOS>
But
Job
had
not
yet
made
up
his
mind
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
go
to
sleep
,
with
all
his
anxieties
,
if
he
were
put
into
the
best
bed
in
Liverpool
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou'lt
let
me
sit
up
in
this
arm
-
chair
,
"
said
he
at
length
to
the
woman
,
who
stood
,
expecting
his
departure
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
an
old
friend
,
so
she
let
him
do
as
he
wished
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
she
was
too
sleepy
to
have
opposed
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
too
glad
to
be
released
and
go
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
HOW
MARY
PASSED
THE
NIGHT
.
<EOS>
"
To
think
That
all
this
long
interminable
night
,
Which
I
have
passed
in
thinking
on
two
words
 
"
Guilty
"
 
"
Not
Guilty
!
"
 
<EOS>
like
one
happy
moment
O'er
many
a
head
hath
flown
unheeded
by
;
O'er
happy
sleepers
dreaming
in
their
bliss
Of
bright
to
-
morrows
 
or
far
happier
still
,
With
deep
breath
buried
in
forgetfulness
.
<EOS>
O
all
the
dismallest
images
of
death
Did
swim
before
my
eyes
!
"
  
<EOS>
WILSON
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
where
was
Mary
?
  
<EOS>
How
Job
's
heart
would
have
been
relieved
of
one
of
its
cares
if
he
could
have
seen
her
:
for
he
was
in
a
miserable
state
of
anxiety
about
her
;
and
many
and
many
a
time
through
that
long
night
he
scolded
her
and
himself
;
her
for
her
obstinacy
,
and
himself
for
his
weakness
in
yielding
to
her
obstinacy
,
when
she
insisted
on
being
the
one
to
follow
and
find
out
Will
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
pass
that
night
in
bed
any
more
than
Job
;
but
she
was
under
a
respectable
roof
,
and
among
kind
,
though
rough
people
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
offered
no
resistance
to
the
old
boatman
,
when
he
had
clutched
her
arm
,
in
order
to
insure
her
following
him
,
as
he
threaded
the
crowded
dock
-
ways
,
and
dived
up
strange
by
-
streets
.
<EOS>
She
came
on
meekly
after
him
,
scarcely
thinking
in
her
stupor
where
she
was
going
,
and
glad
(
in
a
dead
,
heavy
way
)
that
some
one
was
deciding
things
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
led
her
to
an
old
-
fashioned
house
,
almost
as
small
as
house
could
be
,
which
had
been
built
long
ago
,
before
all
the
other
part
of
the
street
,
and
had
a
country
-
town
look
about
it
in
the
middle
of
that
bustling
back
-
street
.
 
<EOS>
He
pulled
her
into
the
house
-
place
;
and
relieved
to
a
certain
degree
of
his
fear
of
losing
her
on
the
way
,
he
exclaimed
   
"
There
!
"
<EOS>
giving
a
great
slap
of
one
hand
on
her
back
.
  
<EOS>
The
room
was
light
and
bright
,
and
roused
Mary
(
perhaps
the
slap
on
her
back
might
help
a
little
too
)
,
and
she
felt
the
awkwardness
of
accounting
for
her
presence
to
a
little
bustling
old
woman
who
had
been
moving
about
the
fireplace
on
her
entrance
.
 
<EOS>
The
boatman
took
it
very
quietly
,
never
deigning
to
give
any
explanation
,
but
sitting
down
in
his
own
particular
chair
,
and
chewing
tobacco
,
while
he
looked
at
Mary
with
the
most
satisfied
air
imaginable
,
half
triumphantly
,
as
if
she
were
the
captive
of
his
bow
and
spear
,
and
half
defying
,
as
if
daring
her
to
escape
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
,
his
wife
,
stood
still
,
poker
in
hand
,
waiting
to
be
told
who
it
was
that
her
husband
had
brought
home
so
unceremoniously
;
but
,
as
she
looked
in
amazement
,
the
girl
's
cheek
flushed
,
and
then
blanched
to
a
dead
whiteness
;
a
film
came
over
her
eyes
,
and
catching
at
the
dresser
for
support
in
that
hot
whirling
room
,
she
fell
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
Both
man
and
wife
came
quickly
to
her
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
They
raised
her
up
,
still
insensible
,
and
he
supported
her
on
one
knee
,
while
his
wife
pattered
away
for
some
cold
fresh
water
.
 
<EOS>
She
threw
it
straight
over
Mary
;
but
though
it
caused
a
great
sob
,
the
eyes
still
remained
closed
,
and
the
face
as
pale
as
ashes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
she
,
Ben
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
woman
,
as
she
rubbed
her
unresisting
,
powerless
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
know
?
"
answered
her
husband
gruffly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
-
a
-
well
!
"
<EOS>
(
in
a
soothing
tone
,
such
as
you
use
to
irritated
children
)
,
and
as
if
half
to
herself
,
"
I
only
thought
you
might
,
you
know
,
as
you
brought
her
home
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
thing
!
<EOS>
we
must
not
ask
aught
about
her
,
but
that
she
needs
help
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
'd
my
salts
at
home
,
but
I
lent
'em
to
Mrs.
Burton
,
last
Sunday
in
church
,
for
she
could
not
keep
awake
through
the
sermon
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
-
a
-
me
,
how
white
she
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
!
you
hold
her
up
a
bit
,
"
said
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
as
he
desired
,
still
crooning
to
herself
,
not
caring
for
his
short
,
sharp
interruptions
as
she
went
on
;
and
,
indeed
,
to
her
old
,
loving
heart
,
his
crossest
words
fell
like
pearls
and
diamonds
,
for
he
had
been
the
husband
of
her
youth
;
and
even
he
,
rough
and
crabbed
as
he
was
,
was
secretly
soothed
by
the
sound
of
her
voice
,
although
not
for
worlds
,
if
he
could
have
helped
it
,
would
he
have
shown
any
of
the
love
that
was
hidden
beneath
his
rough
outside
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
old
fellow
after
?
"
said
she
,
bending
over
Mary
,
so
as
to
accommodate
the
drooping
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Taking
my
pen
,
as
I
've
had
for
better
nor
five
year
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
us
,
and
save
us
!
<EOS>
he
's
burning
it
!
 
<EOS>
Ay
<EOS>
,
I
see
now
,
he
's
his
wits
about
him
;
burnt
feathers
is
always
good
for
a
faint
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
do
n't
bring
her
round
,
poor
wench
!
 
<EOS>
Now
what
's
he
after
next
?
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
he
is
a
bright
one
,
my
old
man
!
 
<EOS>
That
I
never
thought
of
that
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
she
,
as
he
produced
a
square
bottle
of
smuggled
spirits
,
labelled
"
Golden
Wasser
,
"
from
a
corner
cupboard
in
their
little
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
'll
do
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
as
the
dose
he
poured
into
Mary
's
open
mouth
made
her
start
and
cough
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bless
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
just
like
him
to
be
so
tender
and
thoughtful
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
!
"
snarled
he
,
as
he
was
relieved
by
Mary
's
returning
colour
,
and
opened
eyes
,
and
wondering
,
sensible
gaze
;
"
not
a
bit
.
<EOS>
I
never
was
such
a
fool
afore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
wife
helped
Mary
to
rise
,
and
placed
her
in
a
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
's
right
,
now
,
young
woman
?
"
asked
the
boatman
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
and
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
,
sir
,
I
do
n't
know
rightly
how
to
thank
you
,
"
faltered
Mary
softly
forth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Be
hanged
to
you
and
your
thanks
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
shook
himself
,
took
his
pipe
,
and
went
out
without
deigning
another
word
;
leaving
his
wife
sorely
puzzled
as
to
the
character
and
history
of
the
stranger
within
her
doors
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
watched
the
boatman
leave
the
house
,
and
then
,
turning
her
sorrowful
eyes
to
the
face
of
her
hostess
,
she
attempted
feebly
to
rise
,
with
the
intention
of
going
away
,
 
where
she
knew
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
!
<EOS>
nay
!
<EOS>
whoe'er
thou
be'st
,
thou'rt
not
fit
to
go
out
into
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
"
(
sinking
her
voice
a
little
)
"
thou'rt
a
bad
one
;
I
almost
misdoubt
thee
,
thou'rt
so
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
Well
-
a
-
well
!
<EOS>
it
's
the
bad
ones
as
have
the
broken
hearts
,
sure
enough
;
good
folk
never
get
utterly
cast
down
,
they
've
always
getten
hope
in
the
Lord
;
it
's
the
sinful
as
bear
the
bitter
,
bitter
grief
in
their
crushed
hearts
,
poor
souls
;
it
's
them
<EOS>
we
ought
,
most
of
all
,
to
pity
and
help
.
 
<EOS>
She
shanna
leave
the
house
to
-
night
,
choose
who
she
is
 
worst
woman
in
Liverpool
,
she
shanna
.
 
<EOS>
I
wished
I
knew
where
th
'
old
man
picked
her
up
,
that
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
had
listened
feebly
to
this
soliloquy
,
and
now
tried
to
satisfy
her
hostess
in
weak
,
broken
sentences
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
a
bad
one
,
missis
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Your
master
took
me
out
to
see
after
a
ship
as
had
sailed
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
man
in
it
as
might
save
a
life
at
the
trial
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
The
captain
would
not
let
him
come
,
but
he
says
he
'll
come
back
in
the
pilot
-
boat
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
fell
to
sobbing
at
the
thought
of
her
waning
hopes
,
and
the
old
woman
tried
to
comfort
her
,
beginning
with
her
accustomed
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
-
a
-
well
!
<EOS>
and
he
'll
come
back
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
he
will
;
so
keep
up
your
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
fret
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
sure
to
be
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
'm
afraid
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sore
afraid
he
wo
n't
,
"
cried
Mary
,
<EOS>
consoled
,
nevertheless
,
by
the
woman
's
assertions
,
all
groundless
as
she
knew
them
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
Still
talking
half
to
herself
and
half
to
Mary
,
the
old
woman
prepared
tea
,
and
urged
her
visitor
to
eat
and
refresh
herself
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mary
shook
her
head
at
the
proffered
food
,
and
only
drank
a
cup
of
tea
with
thirsty
eagerness
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
spirits
had
thrown
her
into
a
burning
heat
,
and
rendered
each
impression
received
through
her
senses
of
the
most
painful
distinctness
and
intensity
,
while
her
head
ached
in
a
terrible
manner
.
  
<EOS>
She
disliked
speaking
,
her
power
over
her
words
seemed
so
utterly
gone
.
 
<EOS>
She
used
quite
different
expressions
to
those
she
intended
.
<EOS>
So
she
kept
silent
,
while
Mrs.
Sturgis
(
for
that
was
the
name
of
her
hostess
)
talked
away
,
and
put
her
tea
-
things
by
,
and
moved
about
incessantly
,
in
a
manner
that
increased
the
dizziness
in
Mary
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
She
felt
as
if
she
ought
to
take
leave
for
the
night
and
go
.
<EOS>
But
where
?
  
<EOS>
Presently
the
old
man
came
back
,
crosser
and
gruffer
than
when
he
went
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
kicked
aside
the
dry
shoes
his
wife
had
prepared
for
him
,
and
snarled
at
all
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
attributed
this
to
his
finding
her
still
there
,
and
gathered
up
her
strength
for
an
effort
to
leave
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
was
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
,
he
said
(
looking
right
into
the
fire
,
as
if
addressing
it
)
,
"
Wind
's
right
against
them
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
and
is
it
so
?
"
said
his
wife
,
who
,
knowing
him
well
,
knew
that
his
surliness
proceeded
from
some
repressed
sympathy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
-
a
-
well
,
wind
changes
often
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
Time
enough
before
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
bet
a
penny
it
has
changed
sin
'
thou
looked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
out
of
her
little
window
at
a
weathercock
near
,
glittering
in
the
moonlight
;
and
as
she
was
a
sailor
's
wife
,
she
instantly
recognised
the
unfavourable
point
at
which
the
indicator
seemed
stationary
,
and
giving
a
heavy
sigh
,
turned
into
the
room
,
and
began
to
beat
about
in
her
own
mind
for
some
other
mode
of
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
one
else
who
can
prove
what
you
want
at
the
trial
to
-
morrow
,
is
there
?
"
<EOS>
asked
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
one
!
"
answered
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
've
no
clue
to
the
one
as
is
really
guilty
,
if
t'other
is
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
did
not
answer
,
but
trembled
all
over
.
  
<EOS>
Sturgis
saw
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
bother
her
with
thy
questions
,
"
said
he
to
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
mun
go
to
bed
,
for
she
's
all
in
a
shiver
with
the
sea
-
air
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
see
after
the
wind
,
hang
it
,
and
the
weathercock
too
.
 
<EOS>
Tide
will
help
'em
when
it
turns
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
went
upstairs
murmuring
thanks
and
blessings
on
those
who
took
the
stranger
in
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sturgis
led
her
into
a
little
room
redolent
of
the
sea
and
foreign
lands
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
small
bed
for
one
son
bound
for
China
;
and
a
hammock
slung
above
for
another
,
who
was
now
tossing
in
the
Baltic
.
 
<EOS>
The
sheets
looked
made
out
of
sail
-
cloth
,
but
were
fresh
and
clean
in
spite
of
their
brownness
.
  
<EOS>
Against
the
wall
were
wafered
two
rough
drawings
of
vessels
with
their
names
written
underneath
,
on
which
the
mother
's
eyes
caught
,
and
gazed
until
they
filled
with
tears
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
brushed
the
drops
away
with
the
back
of
her
hand
,
and
in
a
cheerful
tone
went
on
to
assure
Mary
the
bed
was
well
aired
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
sleep
,
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
sit
here
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
Mary
,
sinking
down
on
the
window
-
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
now
,
"
said
Mrs.
Sturgis
,
"
my
master
told
me
to
see
you
to
bed
,
and
I
mun
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
use
of
watching
?
 
<EOS>
A
watched
pot
never
boils
,
and
I
see
you
are
after
watching
that
weathercock
.
 
<EOS>
Why
now
,
I
try
never
to
look
at
it
,
else
I
could
do
nought
else
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
many
a
time
goes
sick
when
the
wind
rises
,
but
I
turn
away
and
work
away
,
and
try
never
to
think
on
the
wind
,
but
on
what
I
ha
'
getten
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
stay
up
a
little
,
"
pleaded
Mary
,
as
her
hostess
seemed
so
resolute
about
seeing
her
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Her
looks
won
her
suit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
suppose
I
mun
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
catch
it
downstairs
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
He
'll
be
in
a
fidget
till
you
're
getten
to
bed
<EOS>
,
I
know
;
so
you
mun
be
quiet
if
you
are
so
bent
upon
staying
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
quietly
,
noiselessly
,
Mary
watched
the
unchanging
weathercock
through
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
on
the
little
window
seat
,
her
hand
holding
back
the
curtain
which
shaded
the
room
from
the
bright
moonlight
without
;
her
head
resting
its
weariness
against
the
corner
of
the
window
-
frame
;
her
eyes
burning
and
stiff
with
the
intensity
of
her
gaze
.
  
<EOS>
The
ruddy
morning
stole
up
the
horizon
,
casting
a
crimson
glow
into
the
watcher
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
morning
of
the
day
of
trial
!
   
<EOS>
THE
TRIAL
AND
VERDICT
 
"
NOT
GUILTY
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
stand'st
here
arraign'd
,
<EOS>
That
with
presumption
impious
and
accurs'd

Thou

usurp'd

high

Making

<EOS>
Of
all
the
restless
people
who
found
that
night
's
hours
agonising
from
excess
of
anxiety
,
the
poor
father
of
the
murdered
man
was
perhaps
the
most
restless
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
slept
but
little
since
the
blow
had
fallen
;
his
waking
hours
had
been
too
full
of
agitated
thought
,
which
seemed
to
haunt
and
pursue
him
through
his
unquiet
slumbers
.
  
<EOS>
And
this
night
of
all
others
was
the
most
sleepless
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
over
and
over
again
in
his
mind
the
wonder
if
everything
had
been
done
,
that
could
be
done
,
to
insure
the
conviction
of
Jem
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
He
almost
regretted
the
haste
with
which
he
had
urged
forward
the
proceedings
,
and
yet
,
until
he
had
obtained
vengeance
,
he
felt
as
if
there
was
no
peace
on
earth
for
him
<EOS>
(
I
do
n't
know
that
he
exactly
used
the
term
vengeance
in
his
thoughts
;
he
spoke
of
justice
,
and
probably
thought
of
his
desired
end
as
such
)
;
no
peace
,
either
bodily
or
mental
,
for
he
moved
up
and
down
his
bedroom
with
the
restless
incessant
tramp
of
a
wild
beast
in
a
cage
,
and
if
he
compelled
his
aching
limbs
to
cease
for
an
instant
,
the
twitchings
which
ensued
almost
amounted
to
convulsions
,
and
he
recommenced
his
walk
as
the
lesser
evil
,
and
the
more
bearable
fatigue
.
  
<EOS>
With
daylight
increased
power
of
action
came
;
and
he
drove
off
to
arouse
his
attorney
,
and
worry
him
with
further
directions
and
inquiries
;
and
when
that
was
ended
,
he
sat
,
watch
in
hand
,
until
the
courts
should
be
opened
,
and
the
trial
begin
.
  
<EOS>
What
were
all
the
living
,
 
wife
or
daughters
,
 
what
were
they
in
comparison
with
the
dead
,
the
murdered
son
who
lay
unburied
still
,
in
compliance
with
his
father
's
earnest
wish
,
and
almost
vowed
purpose
,
of
having
the
slayer
of
his
child
sentenced
to
death
,
before
he
committed
the
body
to
the
rest
of
the
grave
?
  
<EOS>
At
nine
o'clock
they
all
met
at
their
awful
place
of
rendezvous
.
  
<EOS>
The
judge
,
the
jury
,
the
avenger
of
blood
,
the
prisoner
,
the
witnesses
 
all
were
gathered
together
within
the
building
.
 
<EOS>
And
besides
these
were
many
others
,
personally
interested
in
some
part
of
the
proceedings
,
in
which
,
however
,
they
took
no
part
;
Job
Legh
,
Ben
Sturgis
,
and
several
others
were
there
,
amongst
whom
was
Charley
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
Job
Legh
had
carefully
avoided
any
questioning
from
Mrs.
Wilson
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
had
not
been
much
in
her
company
,
for
he
had
risen
up
early
to
go
out
once
more
to
make
inquiry
for
Mary
;
and
when
he
could
hear
nothing
of
her
,
he
had
desperately
resolved
not
to
undeceive
Mrs.
Wilson
,
as
sorrow
never
came
too
late
;
and
if
the
blow
were
inevitable
,
it
would
be
better
to
leave
her
in
ignorance
of
the
impending
evil
as
long
as
possible
,
She
took
her
place
in
the
witness
-
room
,
worn
and
dispirited
,
but
not
anxious
.
  
<EOS>
As
Job
struggled
through
the
crowd
into
the
body
of
the
court
,
Mr.
Bridgnorth
's
clerk
beckoned
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
letter
for
you
from
our
client
!
"
  
<EOS>
Job
sickened
as
he
took
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
why
,
but
he
dreaded
a
confession
of
guilt
,
which
would
be
an
overthrow
of
all
hope
.
  
<EOS>
The
letter
ran
as
follows
:
    
"
DEAR
FRIEND
,
 
<EOS>
I
thank
you
heartily
for
your
goodness
in
finding
me
a
lawyer
,
but
lawyers
can
do
no
good
to
me
,
whatever
they
may
do
to
other
people
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
the
less
obliged
to
you
,
dear
friend
.
 
<EOS>
I
foresee
things
will
go
against
me
 
and
no
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
was
a
juryman
I
should
say
the
man
was
guilty
as
had
as
much
evidence
brought
against
him
as
may
be
brought
against
me
tomorrow
.
 
<EOS>
So
it
's
no
blame
to
them
if
they
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Job
Legh
,
I
think
I
need
not
tell
you
I
am
as
guiltless
in
this
matter
as
the
babe
unborn
,
although
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
prove
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
did
not
believe
that
you
thought
me
innocent
,
I
could
not
write
as
I
do
now
to
tell
you
my
wishes
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
not
forget
they
are
the
words
of
a
man
shortly
to
die
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
friend
,
you
must
take
care
of
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Not
in
the
money
way
,
for
she
will
have
enough
for
her
and
Aunt
Alice
;
but
you
must
let
her
talk
to
you
of
me
;
and
show
her
that
(
whatever
others
may
do
)
<EOS>
you
think
I
died
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
reckon
she
'll
stay
long
behind
when
we
are
all
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Be
tender
with
her
,
Job
,
for
my
sake
;
and
if
she
is
a
bit
fractious
at
times
,
remember
what
she
has
gone
through
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
mother
will
never
doubt
me
,
God
bless
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
one
other
whom
I
fear
I
have
loved
too
dearly
;
and
yet
,
the
loving
her
has
made
the
happiness
of
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
think
I
have
murdered
her
lover
:
she
will
think
I
have
caused
the
grief
she
must
be
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
must
go
on
thinking
so
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
hard
upon
me
to
say
this
;
but
she
MUST
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
best
for
her
,
and
that
's
all
I
ought
to
think
on
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
dear
Job
,
you
are
a
hearty
fellow
for
your
time
of
life
,
and
may
live
many
years
to
come
;
and
perhaps
you
could
tell
her
,
when
you
felt
sure
you
were
drawing
near
your
end
,
that
I
solemnly
told
you
(
as
I
do
now
)
that
I
was
innocent
of
this
thing
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
tell
her
for
many
years
to
come
:
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
well
bear
to
think
on
her
living
through
a
long
life
,
and
hating
the
thought
of
me
as
the
murderer
of
him
she
loved
,
and
dying
with
that
hatred
to
me
in
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
hurt
me
sore
in
the
other
world
to
see
the
look
of
it
in
her
face
,
as
it
would
be
,
till
she
was
told
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
let
myself
think
on
how
she
must
be
viewing
me
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
God
bless
you
,
Job
Legh
;
and
no
more
from
yours
to
command
,
  
"
JAMES
WILSON
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Job
turned
the
letter
over
and
over
when
he
had
read
it
;
sighed
deeply
;
and
then
wrapping
it
carefully
up
in
a
bit
of
newspaper
he
had
about
him
,
he
put
it
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
and
went
off
to
the
door
of
the
witness
-
room
to
ask
if
Mary
Barton
was
there
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
door
opened
he
saw
her
sitting
within
,
against
a
table
on
which
her
folded
arms
were
resting
,
and
her
head
was
hidden
within
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
attitude
of
hopelessness
,
and
would
have
served
to
strike
Job
dumb
in
sickness
of
heart
,
even
without
the
sound
of
Mrs.
Wilson
's
voice
in
passionate
sobbing
,
and
sore
lamentations
,
which
told
him
as
well
as
words
could
do
(
for
she
was
not
within
view
of
the
door
,
and
he
did
not
care
to
go
in
)
,
that
she
was
at
any
rate
partially
undeceived
as
to
the
hopes
he
had
given
her
last
night
.
  
<EOS>
Sorrowfully
did
Job
return
into
the
body
of
the
court
;
neither
Mrs.
Wilson
nor
Mary
having
seen
him
as
he
had
stood
at
the
witness
-
room
door
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
could
bring
his
distracted
thoughts
to
bear
upon
the
present
scene
,
he
perceived
that
the
trial
of
James
Wilson
for
the
murder
of
Henry
Carson
was
just
commencing
.
 
<EOS>
The
clerk
was
gabbling
over
the
indictment
,
and
in
a
minute
or
two
there
was
the
accustomed
question
,
"
How
say
you
,
Guilty
or
Not
Guilty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Although
but
one
answer
was
expected
,
 
was
customary
in
all
cases
,
 
there
was
a
pause
of
dead
silence
,
an
interval
of
solemnity
even
in
this
hackneyed
part
of
the
proceeding
;
while
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
stood
with
compressed
lips
,
looking
at
the
judge
with
his
outward
eyes
,
but
with
far
other
and
different
scenes
presented
to
his
mental
vision
;
a
sort
of
rapid
recapitulation
of
his
life
,
 
remembrances
of
his
childhood
,
 
his
father
(
so
proud
of
him
,
his
first
-
born
child
)
,
 
his
sweet
little
playfellow
,
Mary
,
 
his
hopes
,
his
love
,
his
despair
,
 
yet
still
,
yet
ever
and
ever
,
his
love
,
 
the
blank
,
wide
world
<EOS>
it
had
been
without
her
love
,
 
his
mother
,
 
his
childless
mother
,
 
but
not
long
to
be
so
,
 
not
long
to
be
away
from
all
she
loved
,
 
nor
during
that
time
to
be
oppressed
with
doubt
as
to
his
innocence
,
sure
and
secure
of
her
darling
's
heart
;
 
he
started
from
his
instant
's
pause
,
and
said
in
a
low
firm
voice
  
"
Not
guilty
,
my
lord
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
circumstances
of
the
murder
,
the
discovery
of
the
body
,
the
causes
of
suspicion
against
Jem
,
were
as
well
known
to
most
of
the
audience
as
they
are
to
you
,
so
there
was
some
little
buzz
of
conversation
going
on
among
the
people
while
the
leading
counsel
for
the
prosecution
made
his
very
effective
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
Mr.
Carson
,
the
father
,
sitting
behind
Serjeant
Wilkinson
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
noble
-
looking
old
man
he
is
!
<EOS>
so
stern
and
inflexible
,
with
such
classical
features
!
 
<EOS>
Does
he
not
remind
you
of
some
of
the
busts
of
Jupiter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
more
interested
by
watching
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
Criminals
always
interest
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
to
trace
in
the
features
common
to
humanity
some
expression
of
the
crimes
by
which
they
have
distinguished
themselves
from
their
kind
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
a
good
number
of
murderers
in
my
day
,
but
I
have
seldom
seen
one
with
such
marks
of
Cain
on
his
countenance
as
the
man
at
the
bar
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
am
no
physiognomist
,
but
I
do
n't
think
his
face
strikes
me
as
bad
.
 
<EOS>
It
certainly
is
gloomy
and
depressed
,
and
not
unnaturally
so
,
considering
his
situation
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Only
look
at
his
low
,
resolute
brow
,
his
downcast
eye
,
his
white
compressed
lips
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
looks
up
,
 
just
watch
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
forehead
is
not
so
low
if
he
had
that
mass
of
black
hair
removed
,
and
is
very
square
,
which
some
people
say
is
a
good
sign
.
<EOS>
If
others
are
to
be
influenced
by
such
trifles
as
you
are
,
it
would
have
been
much
better
if
the
prison
barber
had
cut
his
hair
a
little
previous
to
the
trial
;
and
as
for
downcast
eye
,
and
compressed
lip
,
it
is
all
part
and
parcel
of
his
inward
agitation
just
now
;
nothing
to
do
with
character
,
my
good
fellow
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Jem
!
 
<EOS>
His
raven
hair
(
his
mother
's
pride
,
and
so
often
fondly
caressed
by
her
fingers
)
,
was
that
,
too
,
to
have
its
influence
against
him
?
  
<EOS>
The
witnesses
were
called
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
they
consisted
principally
of
policemen
;
who
,
being
much
accustomed
to
giving
evidence
,
knew
what
were
the
material
points
they
were
called
on
to
prove
,
and
did
not
lose
the
time
of
the
court
in
listening
to
anything
unnecessary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Clear
as
day
against
the
prisoner
,
"
whispered
one
attorney
's
clerk
to
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
Black
as
night
,
you
mean
,
"
replied
his
friend
;
and
they
both
smiled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
Wilson
!
<EOS>
who
's
she
?
<EOS>
some
relation
,
I
suppose
,
from
the
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
The
mother
,
 
she
that
is
to
prove
the
gun
part
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
ay
 
I
remember
!
 
<EOS>
Rather
hard
on
her
,
too
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
both
were
silent
,
as
one
of
the
officers
of
the
court
ushered
Mrs.
Wilson
into
the
witness
-
box
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
called
her
"
the
old
woman
,
"
and
"
an
old
woman
,
"
because
,
in
truth
,
her
appearance
was
so
much
beyond
her
years
,
which
could
not
be
many
above
fifty
.
 
<EOS>
But
partly
owing
to
her
accident
in
early
life
,
which
left
a
stamp
of
pain
upon
her
face
,
partly
owing
to
her
anxious
temper
,
partly
to
her
sorrows
,
and
partly
to
her
limping
gait
,
she
always
gave
me
the
idea
of
age
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
she
might
have
seemed
more
than
seventy
;
her
lines
were
so
set
and
deep
,
her
features
so
sharpened
,
and
her
walk
so
feeble
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
trying
to
check
her
sobs
into
composure
,
and
(
unconsciously
)
was
striving
to
behave
as
she
thought
would
best
please
her
poor
boy
,
whom
she
knew
she
had
often
grieved
by
her
uncontrolled
impatience
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
buried
his
face
in
his
arms
,
which
rested
on
the
front
of
the
dock
(
an
attitude
he
retained
during
the
greater
part
of
his
trial
,
and
which
prejudiced
many
against
him
)
.
  
<EOS>
The
counsel
began
the
examination
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
name
is
Jane
Wilson
,
I
believe
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
mother
of
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
with
quivering
voice
,
ready
to
break
out
into
weeping
,
but
earning
respect
by
the
strong
effort
at
self
-
control
,
prompted
,
as
I
have
said
before
,
by
her
earnest
wish
to
please
her
son
by
her
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
The
barrister
now
proceeded
to
the
important
part
of
the
examination
,
tending
to
prove
that
the
gun
found
on
the
scene
of
the
murder
was
the
prisoner
's
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
committed
herself
so
fully
to
the
policeman
,
that
she
could
not
well
retract
;
so
without
much
delay
in
bringing
the
question
round
to
the
desired
point
,
the
gun
was
produced
in
court
,
and
the
inquiry
made
   
"
<EOS>
That
gun
belongs
to
your
son
,
does
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
clenched
the
sides
of
the
witness
-
box
in
her
efforts
to
make
her
parched
tongue
utter
words
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
she
moaned
forth
   
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Jem
,
Jem
!
<EOS>
what
mun
I
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
Every
one
bent
forward
to
hear
the
prisoner
's
answer
;
although
,
in
fact
,
it
was
of
little
importance
to
the
issue
of
the
trial
.
 
<EOS>
He
lifted
up
his
head
;
and
with
a
face
brimming
full
of
pity
for
his
mother
,
yet
resolved
into
endurance
,
said
   
"
<EOS>
Tell
the
truth
,
mother
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
she
did
,
with
the
fidelity
of
a
little
child
.
 
<EOS>
Every
one
felt
that
she
did
;
and
the
little
colloquy
between
mother
and
son
did
them
some
slight
service
in
the
opinion
of
the
audience
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
awful
judge
sat
unmoved
;
and
the
jurymen
changed
not
a
muscle
of
their
countenances
;
while
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
went
triumphantly
through
this
part
of
the
case
,
including
the
fact
of
Jem
's
absence
from
home
on
the
night
of
the
murder
,
and
bringing
every
admission
to
bear
right
against
the
prisoner
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
over
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
told
to
go
down
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
could
no
longer
compel
her
mother
's
heart
to
keep
silence
,
and
suddenly
turning
towards
the
judge
(
with
whom
she
imagined
the
verdict
to
rest
)
<EOS>
,
she
thus
addressed
him
with
her
choking
voice
   
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
sir
,
I
've
telled
you
the
truth
,
and
<EOS>
the
whole
truth
,
as
he
bid
me
;
but
do
n't
you
let
what
I
have
said
go
for
to
hang
him
;
oh
,
my
lord
judge
,
take
my
word
for
it
,
he
's
as
innocent
as
the
child
as
has
yet
to
be
born
.
 
<EOS>
For
sure
,
I
,
who
am
his
mother
,
and
have
nursed
him
on
my
knee
,
and
been
gladdened
by
the
sight
of
him
every
day
since
,
ought
to
know
him
better
than
yon
pack
of
fellows
"
(
indicating
the
jury
,
while
she
strove
against
her
heart
to
render
her
words
distinct
and
clear
for
her
dear
son
's
sake
)
,
"
who
,
I
'll
go
bail
,
never
saw
him
before
this
morning
in
all
their
born
days
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
judge
,
he
's
so
good
<EOS>
I
often
wondered
what
harm
there
was
in
him
;
many
is
the
time
when
I
've
been
fretted
(
for
I
'm
frabbit
enough
at
times
)
,
when
I
've
scold't
myself
,
and
said
:
"
You
ungrateful
thing
,
the
Lord
God
has
given
you
Jem
,
and
is
n't
that
blessing
enough
for
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
But
He
has
seen
fit
to
punish
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
Jem
is
 
if
Jem
is
 
taken
from
me
,
I
shall
be
a
childless
woman
;
and
very
poor
,
having
nought
left
to
love
on
earth
,
and
I
can
not
say
"
His
will
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
my
lord
judge
,
oh
,
I
can
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
While
sobbing
out
these
words
she
was
led
away
by
the
officers
of
the
court
,
but
tenderly
,
and
reverently
,
with
the
respect
which
great
sorrow
commands
.
  
<EOS>
The
stream
of
evidence
went
on
and
on
,
gathering
fresh
force
from
every
witness
who
was
examined
,
and
threatening
to
overwhelm
poor
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
Already
they
had
proved
that
the
gun
was
his
,
that
he
had
been
heard
not
many
days
before
the
commission
of
the
deed
to
threaten
the
deceased
;
indeed
,
that
the
police
had
,
at
that
time
,
been
obliged
to
interfere
,
to
prevent
some
probable
act
of
violence
.
 
<EOS>
It
only
remained
to
bring
forward
a
sufficient
motive
for
the
threat
and
the
murder
.
 
<EOS>
The
clue
to
this
had
been
furnished
by
the
policeman
,
who
had
overheard
Jem
's
angry
language
to
Mr.
Carson
;
and
his
report
in
the
first
instance
had
occasioned
the
sub
-
poena
to
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
she
was
to
be
called
on
to
bear
witness
.
 
<EOS>
The
court
was
by
this
time
almost
as
full
as
it
could
hold
;
but
fresh
attempts
were
being
made
to
squeeze
in
at
all
the
entrances
,
for
many
were
anxious
to
see
and
hear
this
part
of
the
trial
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Mr.
Carson
felt
an
additional
beat
at
his
heart
at
the
thought
of
seeing
the
fatal
Helen
,
the
cause
of
all
,
 
a
kind
of
interest
and
yet
repugnance
,
for
was
not
she
beloved
by
the
dead
;
nay
,
perhaps
,
in
her
way
,
loving
and
mourning
for
the
same
being
that
he
himself
was
so
bitterly
grieving
over
?
 
<EOS>
And
yet
he
felt
as
if
he
abhorred
her
and
her
rumoured
loveliness
,
as
if
she
were
the
curse
against
him
;
and
he
grew
jealous
of
the
love
with
which
she
had
inspired
his
son
,
and
would
fain
have
deprived
her
of
even
her
natural
right
of
sorrowing
over
her
lover
's
untimely
end
:
for
you
see
it
was
a
fixed
idea
in
the
minds
of
all
,
that
the
handsome
,
bright
,
gay
,
rich
young
gentleman
must
have
been
beloved
in
preference
to
the
serious
,
almost
stern
-
looking
smith
,
who
had
to
toil
for
his
daily
bread
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
<EOS>
the
effect
of
the
trial
had
equalled
Mr.
Carson
's
most
sanguine
hopes
,
and
a
severe
look
of
satisfaction
came
over
the
face
of
the
avenger
,
 
over
that
countenance
<EOS>
whence
<EOS>
the
smile
had
departed
,
never
more
to
return
.
  
<EOS>
All
eyes
were
directed
to
the
door
through
which
the
witnesses
entered
.
 
<EOS>
Even
Jem
looked
up
to
catch
one
glimpse
before
he
hid
his
face
from
her
look
of
aversion
.
 
<EOS>
The
officer
had
gone
to
fetch
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
in
exactly
the
same
attitude
as
when
Job
Legh
had
seen
her
two
hours
before
through
the
half
-
open
door
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
finger
had
moved
.
 
<EOS>
The
officer
summoned
her
,
but
she
did
not
stir
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
<EOS>
so
still
,
he
thought
she
had
fallen
asleep
,
and
he
stepped
forward
and
touched
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
started
up
in
an
instant
,
and
followed
him
with
a
kind
of
rushing
rapid
motion
into
the
court
,
into
the
witness
-
box
.
  
<EOS>
And
amid
all
that
sea
of
faces
,
misty
and
swimming
before
her
eyes
,
she
saw
<EOS>
but
two
clear
bright
spots
,
distinct
and
fixed
:
the
judge
,
who
might
have
to
condemn
;
and
the
prisoner
,
who
might
have
to
die
.
  
<EOS>
The
mellow
sunlight
streamed
down
that
high
window
on
her
head
,
and
fell
on
the
rich
treasure
of
her
golden
hair
,
stuffed
away
in
masses
under
her
little
bonnet
-
cap
;
and
in
those
warm
beams
the
motes
kept
dancing
up
and
down
.
 
<EOS>
The
wind
had
changed
 
had
changed
almost
as
soon
as
she
had
given
up
her
watching
;
the
wind
had
changed
,
and
she
heeded
it
not
.
  
<EOS>
Many
who
were
looking
for
mere
flesh
and
blood
beauty
,
mere
colouring
,
were
disappointed
;
for
her
face
was
deadly
white
,
and
almost
set
in
its
expression
,
while
a
mournful
bewildered
soul
looked
out
of
the
depths
of
those
soft
,
deep
,
grey
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
But
others
recognised
a
higher
and
a
stranger
kind
of
beauty
;
one
that
would
keep
its
hold
on
the
memory
for
many
after
years
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
not
there
myself
;
but
one
who
was
,
told
me
that
her
look
,
and
indeed
her
whole
face
,
was
more
like
the
well
-
known
engraving
from
Guido
's
picture
of
"
Beatrice
Cenci
"
than
anything
else
he
could
give
me
an
idea
of
.
 
<EOS>
He
added
,
that
her
countenance
haunted
him
,
like
the
remembrance
of
some
wild
sad
melody
,
heard
in
childhood
;
that
it
would
perpetually
recur
with
its
mute
imploring
agony
.
  
<EOS>
With
all
the
court
reeling
before
her
(
always
save
and
except
those
awful
two
)
,
she
heard
a
voice
speak
,
and
answered
the
simple
inquiry
(
something
about
her
name
)
<EOS>
mechanically
,
as
if
in
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
went
on
for
two
or
three
more
questions
,
with
a
strange
wonder
in
her
brain
,
at
the
reality
of
the
terrible
circumstances
in
which
she
was
placed
.
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
she
was
roused
,
she
knew
not
how
or
by
what
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
conscious
that
all
was
real
,
that
hundreds
were
looking
at
her
,
that
true
-
sounding
words
were
being
extracted
from
her
;
<EOS>
that
that
figure
,
so
bowed
down
,
with
the
face
concealed
with
both
hands
,
was
really
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
flushed
scarlet
,
and
then
,
paler
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
dread
of
herself
,
with
the
tremendous
secret
imprisoned
within
her
,
she
exerted
every
power
she
had
to
keep
in
the
full
understanding
of
what
was
going
on
,
of
what
she
was
asked
,
and
of
what
she
answered
.
<EOS>
With
all
her
faculties
preternaturally
alive
and
sensitive
,
she
heard
the
next
question
from
the
pert
young
barrister
,
who
was
delighted
to
have
the
examination
of
this
witness
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
pray
,
may
I
ask
,
which
was
the
favoured
lover
?
 
<EOS>
You
say
you
knew
both
these
young
men
.
 
<EOS>
Which
was
the
favoured
lover
?
 
<EOS>
Which
did
you
prefer
?
"
  
<EOS>
And
who
was
he
,
the
questioner
,
that
he
should
dare
so
lightly
to
ask
of
her
heart
's
secrets
?
 
<EOS>
That
he
should
dare
to
ask
her
to
tell
,
before
that
multitude
assembled
there
,
what
woman
usually
whispers
with
blushes
and
tears
,
and
many
hesitations
,
to
one
ear
alone
?
  
<EOS>
So
,
for
an
instant
,
a
look
of
indignation
contracted
Mary
's
brow
,
as
she
steadily
met
the
eyes
of
the
impertinent
counsellor
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
that
instant
,
she
saw
the
hands
removed
from
a
face
beyond
,
behind
;
and
a
countenance
revealed
of
such
intense
love
and
woe
,
 
such
a
deprecating
dread
of
her
answer
;
and
suddenly
her
resolution
was
taken
.
 
<EOS>
The
present
was
everything
;
the
future
,
that
vast
shroud
,
it
was
maddening
to
think
upon
;
but
NOW
she
might
own
her
fault
,
but
NOW
she
might
even
own
her
love
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
when
the
beloved
stood
thus
,
abhorred
of
men
,
there
would
be
no
feminine
shame
to
stand
between
her
and
her
avowal
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
also
turned
towards
the
judge
,
partly
to
mark
that
her
answer
was
not
given
to
the
monkeyfied
man
who
questioned
her
,
and
likewise
that
the
face
might
be
averted
from
,
and
her
eyes
not
gaze
upon
,
the
form
that
contracted
with
the
dread
of
the
words
he
anticipated
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
asks
me
which
of
them
two
I
liked
best
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
liked
Mr.
Harry
Carson
once
 
I
do
n't
know
 
I
've
forgotten
;
but
I
loved
James
Wilson
<EOS>
,
that
's
now
on
trial
,
above
what
tongue
can
tell
 
above
all
else
on
earth
put
together
;
and
I
love
him
now
better
than
ever
,
though
he
has
never
known
a
word
of
it
till
this
minute
.
 
<EOS>
For
you
see
,
sir
,
mother
died
before
I
was
thirteen
,
before
I
could
know
right
from
wrong
about
some
things
;
and
I
was
giddy
and
vain
,
and
ready
to
listen
to
any
praise
of
my
good
looks
;
and
this
poor
young
Mr.
Carson
fell
in
with
me
,
and
told
me
he
loved
me
;
and
I
was
foolish
enough
to
think
he
meant
me
marriage
:
a
mother
is
a
pitiful
loss
to
a
girl
,
sir
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
used
to
fancy
<EOS>
I
could
like
to
be
a
lady
,
and
rich
,
and
never
know
want
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
found
out
how
dearly
I
loved
another
till
one
day
,
when
James
Wilson
asked
me
to
marry
him
,
and
I
was
very
hard
and
sharp
in
my
answer
(
for
indeed
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
'd
a
deal
to
bear
just
then
)
,
and
he
took
me
at
my
word
and
left
me
;
and
from
that
day
to
this
I
've
never
spoken
a
word
to
him
,
or
set
eyes
on
him
;
though
I
'd
fain
have
done
so
,
to
try
and
show
him
we
had
both
been
too
hasty
;
for
he
'd
not
been
gone
out
of
my
sight
above
a
minute
before
I
knew
I
loved
 
far
above
my
life
,
"
said
she
,
dropping
her
voice
as
she
came
to
this
second
confession
of
the
strength
of
her
attachment
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
if
the
gentleman
asks
me
which
I
loved
the
best
,
I
make
answer
,
I
was
flattered
by
Mr.
Carson
,
and
pleased
with
his
flattery
;
but
James
Wilson
,
I
"
  
<EOS>
She
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
,
to
hide
the
burning
scarlet
blushes
,
which
even
dyed
her
fingers
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
pause
;
still
,
though
her
speech
might
inspire
pity
for
the
prisoner
,
it
only
strengthened
the
supposition
of
his
guilt
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
the
counsellor
went
on
with
his
examination
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
seen
young
Mr.
Carson
since
your
rejection
of
the
prisoner
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
often
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
spoken
to
him
,
I
conclude
,
at
these
times
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
once
,
to
call
speaking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
was
the
substance
of
your
conversation
?
 
<EOS>
Did
you
tell
him
you
found
you
preferred
his
rival
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
as
I
've
done
wrong
in
saying
,
now
as
things
stand
,
what
my
feelings
are
;
but
I
never
would
be
so
bold
as
to
tell
one
young
man
I
cared
for
another
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
named
Jem
's
name
to
Mr.
Carson
.
 
<EOS>
Never
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
what
did
you
say
when
you
had
this
final
conversation
with
Mr.
Carson
?
 
<EOS>
You
can
give
me
the
substance
of
it
,
if
you
do
n't
remember
the
words
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
try
,
sir
;
but
I
'm
not
very
clear
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
could
not
love
him
,
and
wished
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
his
best
to
over
-
persuade
me
,
but
I
kept
steady
,
and
at
last
I
ran
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
never
spoke
to
him
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
young
woman
,
remember
you
are
upon
your
oath
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
tell
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
of
Mr.
Henry
Carson
's
attentions
to
you
?
<EOS>
of
your
acquaintance
,
in
short
?
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
try
to
excite
his
jealousy
by
boasting
of
a
lover
so
far
above
you
in
station
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Never
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
did
,
"
said
she
,
in
so
firm
and
distinct
a
manner
as
to
leave
no
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Were
you
aware
that
he
knew
of
Mr.
Henry
Carson
's
regard
for
you
?
<EOS>
Remember
you
are
on
your
oath
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
aware
until
I
heard
of
the
quarrel
between
them
,
and
<EOS>
what
Jem
had
said
to
the
policeman
,
and
that
was
after
the
murder
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
day
I
ca
n't
make
out
who
told
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
may
not
I
go
down
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
For
she
felt
the
sense
,
the
composure
,
the
very
bodily
strength
which
she
had
compelled
to
her
aid
for
a
time
,
suddenly
giving
way
,
and
was
conscious
that
she
was
losing
all
command
over
herself
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
occasion
to
detain
her
longer
;
she
had
done
her
part
.
<EOS>
She
might
go
down
.
 
<EOS>
The
evidence
was
still
stronger
against
the
prisoner
;
but
now
he
stood
erect
and
firm
,
with
self
-
respect
in
his
attitude
,
and
a
look
of
determination
on
his
face
,
which
almost
made
it
appear
noble
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
he
seemed
lost
in
thought
.
  
<EOS>
Job
Legh
had
all
this
time
been
trying
to
soothe
and
comfort
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilson
,
who
would
first
be
in
the
court
,
in
order
to
see
her
darling
,
and
then
,
when
her
sobs
became
irrepressible
,
had
to
be
led
out
into
the
open
air
,
and
sat
there
weeping
,
on
the
steps
of
the
court
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
Who
would
have
taken
charge
of
Mary
,
on
her
release
from
the
witness
-
box
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
,
if
Mrs.
Sturgis
,
the
boatman
's
wife
,
had
not
been
there
,
brought
by
her
interest
in
Mary
,
towards
whom
she
now
pressed
,
in
order
to
urge
her
to
leave
the
scene
of
the
trial
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
no
!
"
said
Mary
,
to
this
proposition
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
be
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
watch
that
they
do
n't
hang
him
,
you
know
I
must
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
they
'll
not
hang
him
!
<EOS>
never
fear
!
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
wind
has
changed
,
and
that
's
in
his
favour
.
 
<EOS>
Come
away
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
so
hot
,
and
first
white
and
then
red
;
I
'm
sure
you
're
ill
.
 
<EOS>
Just
come
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
do
n't
know
about
anything
but
that
I
must
stay
,
"
replied
Mary
,
in
a
strange
hurried
manner
,
catching
hold
of
some
rails
as
if
she
feared
some
bodily
force
would
be
employed
to
remove
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
Mrs.
Sturgis
just
waited
patiently
by
her
,
every
now
and
then
peeping
among
the
congregation
of
heads
in
the
body
of
the
court
,
to
see
if
her
husband
were
still
there
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
he
always
was
to
be
seen
,
looking
and
listening
with
all
his
might
.
 
<EOS>
His
wife
felt
easy
that
he
would
not
be
wanting
her
at
home
until
the
trial
was
ended
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
never
let
go
her
clutched
hold
on
the
rails
.
 
<EOS>
She
wanted
them
to
steady
her
,
in
that
heaving
,
whirling
court
.
 
<EOS>
She
thought
the
feeling
of
something
hard
compressed
within
her
hand
would
help
her
to
listen
,
for
it
was
such
pain
,
such
weary
pain
in
her
head
,
to
strive
to
attend
to
what
was
being
said
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
all
at
sea
,
sailing
away
on
billowy
waves
,
and
every
one
speaking
at
once
,
and
no
one
heeding
her
father
,
who
was
calling
on
them
to
be
silent
,
and
listen
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Then
again
,
for
a
brief
second
,
the
court
stood
still
,
and
she
could
see
the
judge
,
sitting
up
there
like
an
idol
,
with
his
trappings
,
so
rigid
and
stiff
;
and
Jem
,
opposite
,
looking
at
her
,
as
if
to
say
,
Am
I
to
die
for
what
you
know
your
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
checked
herself
,
and
by
a
great
struggle
brought
herself
round
to
an
instant
's
sanity
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
round
of
thought
never
stood
still
;
and
off
she
went
again
;
and
every
time
her
power
of
struggling
against
the
growing
delirium
grew
fainter
and
fainter
.
 
<EOS>
She
muttered
low
to
herself
,
but
no
one
heard
her
except
her
neighbour
,
Mrs.
Sturgis
;
all
were
too
closely
attending
to
the
case
for
the
prosecution
,
which
was
now
being
wound
up
.
  
<EOS>
The
counsel
for
the
prisoner
had
avoided
much
cross
-
examination
,
reserving
to
himself
the
right
of
calling
the
witnesses
forward
again
;
for
he
had
received
so
little
,
and
such
vague
instructions
,
and
understood
that
so
much
depended
on
the
evidence
of
one
who
was
not
forthcoming
,
that
in
fact
he
had
little
hope
of
establishing
anything
like
a
show
of
a
defence
,
and
contented
himself
with
watching
the
case
,
and
lying
in
wait
for
any
legal
objections
that
might
offer
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
He
lay
back
on
the
seat
,
occasionally
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
in
a
manner
intended
to
be
contemptuous
;
now
and
then
elevating
his
eyebrows
,
and
sometimes
exchanging
a
little
note
with
Mr.
Bridgnorth
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
attorney
had
far
more
interest
in
the
case
than
the
barrister
,
to
which
he
was
perhaps
excited
by
his
poor
old
friend
Job
Legh
;
who
had
edged
and
wedged
himself
through
the
crowd
close
to
Mr.
Bridgnorth
's
elbow
,
sent
thither
by
Ben
Sturgis
,
to
whom
he
had
been
"
introduced
"
by
Charley
Jones
,
and
who
had
accounted
for
Mary
's
disappearance
on
the
preceding
day
,
and
spoken
of
their
chase
,
their
fears
,
their
hopes
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
was
told
in
a
few
words
to
Mr.
Bridgnorth
 
so
few
,
that
they
gave
him
but
a
confused
idea
,
that
time
was
of
value
;
and
this
he
named
to
his
counsel
,
who
now
rose
to
speak
for
the
defence
.
  
<EOS>
Job
Legh
looked
about
for
Mary
,
now
he
had
gained
,
and
given
,
some
idea
of
the
position
of
things
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
saw
her
,
standing
by
a
decent
-
looking
woman
,
looking
flushed
and
anxious
,
and
moving
her
lips
incessantly
,
as
if
eagerly
talking
;
her
eyes
never
resting
on
any
object
,
but
wandering
about
as
if
in
search
of
something
.
 
<EOS>
Job
thought
it
was
for
him
she
was
seeking
,
and
he
struggled
to
get
round
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
succeeded
,
she
took
no
notice
of
him
,
although
he
spoke
to
her
,
but
still
kept
looking
round
and
round
in
the
same
wild
,
restless
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
tried
to
hear
the
low
quick
mutterings
of
her
voice
,
as
he
caught
the
repetition
of
the
same
words
over
and
over
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
go
mad
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
people
tell
the
truth
when
they
're
mad
;
but
I
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
always
a
liar
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
,
indeed
;
but
I
'm
not
mad
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
go
mad
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
she
seemed
to
become
aware
how
earnestly
Job
was
listening
(
with
mournful
attention
)
to
her
words
,
and
turning
sharp
round
upon
him
,
with
upbraiding
for
his
eavesdropping
on
her
lips
<EOS>
,
she
caught
sight
of
something
,
 
or
some
one
,
 
who
even
in
that
state
,
had
power
to
arrest
her
attention
;
and
throwing
up
her
arms
with
wild
energy
,
she
shrieked
aloud
   
<EOS>
"
O
Jem
!
<EOS>
Jem
!
<EOS>
you
're
saved
;
and
I
AM
mad
"
and
was
instantly
seized
with
convulsions
.
 
<EOS>
With
much
commiseration
she
was
taken
out
of
court
,
while
the
attention
of
many
was
diverted
from
her
,
by
the
fierce
energy
with
which
a
sailor
forced
his
way
over
rails
and
seats
,
against
turnkeys
and
policemen
.
 
<EOS>
The
officers
of
the
court
opposed
this
forcible
manner
of
entrance
,
but
they
could
hardly
induce
the
offender
to
adopt
any
quieter
way
of
attaining
his
object
,
and
telling
his
tale
in
the
witness
-
box
,
the
legitimate
place
.
 
<EOS>
For
Will
had
dwelt
so
impatiently
on
the
danger
in
which
his
absence
would
place
his
cousin
,
that
even
yet
he
seemed
to
fear
that
he
might
see
the
prisoner
carried
off
,
and
hung
,
before
he
could
pour
out
the
narrative
which
would
exculpate
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
Job
Legh
,
his
feelings
were
all
but
uncontrollable
;
as
you
may
judge
by
the
indifference
with
which
he
saw
Mary
borne
,
stiff
and
convulsed
,
out
of
the
court
,
in
the
charge
of
the
kind
Mrs.
Sturgis
,
who
,
you
will
remember
,
was
an
utter
stranger
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
'll
keep
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
not
trouble
myself
about
her
,
"
said
he
to
himself
,
as
he
wrote
with
trembling
hands
a
little
note
of
information
to
Mr.
Bridgnorth
,
who
had
conjectured
,
when
Will
had
first
disturbed
the
awful
tranquillity
of
the
life
-
and
-
death
court
,
that
the
witness
had
arrived
(
better
late
than
never
)
on
whose
evidence
rested
all
the
slight
chance
yet
remaining
to
Jem
Wilson
of
escaping
death
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
commotion
in
the
court
,
among
all
the
cries
and
commands
,
the
dismay
and
the
directions
,
consequent
upon
Will
's
entrance
,
and
poor
Mary
's
fearful
attack
of
illness
,
Mr.
Bridgnorth
had
kept
his
lawyer
-
like
presence
of
mind
;
and
long
before
Job
Legh
's
almost
illegible
note
was
poked
at
him
,
he
had
recapitulated
the
facts
on
which
Will
had
to
give
evidence
,
and
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
pursued
,
after
his
ship
had
taken
her
leave
of
the
land
.
  
<EOS>
The
barrister
who
defended
Jem
took
new
heart
when
he
was
put
in
possession
of
these
striking
points
to
be
adduced
,
not
so
much
out
of
earnestness
to
save
the
prisoner
,
of
whose
innocence
he
was
still
doubtful
,
as
because
he
saw
the
opportunities
for
the
display
of
forensic
eloquence
which
were
presented
by
the
facts
;
"
a
gallant
tar
brought
back
from
the
pathless
ocean
by
a
girl
's
noble
daring
,
"
"
the
dangers
of
too
hastily
judging
from
circumstantial
evidence
,
"
etc
.
<EOS>
etc
.
<EOS>
;
while
the
counsellor
for
the
prosecution
prepared
himself
by
folding
his
arms
,
elevating
his
eyebrows
,
and
putting
his
lips
in
the
form
in
which
they
might
best
whistle
down
the
wind
such
evidence
as
might
be
produced
by
a
suborned
witness
,
who
dared
to
perjure
himself
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
of
course
,
it
is
etiquette
to
suppose
that
such
evidence
as
may
be
given
against
the
opinion
which
lawyers
are
paid
to
uphold
,
is
anything
but
based
on
truth
;
and
"
perjury
,
"
"
conspiracy
,
"
and
"
peril
of
your
immortal
soul
,
"
are
light
expressions
to
throw
at
the
heads
of
those
who
may
prove
(
not
the
speaker
,
there
would
then
be
some
excuse
for
the
hasty
words
of
personal
anger
,
but
)
<EOS>
the
hirer
of
the
speaker
to
be
wrong
,
or
mistaken
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
once
Will
had
attained
his
end
,
and
felt
that
his
tale
,
or
part
of
a
tale
,
would
be
heard
by
judge
and
jury
;
when
once
he
saw
Jem
standing
safe
and
well
before
him
(
even
though
he
saw
him
pale
and
careworn
at
the
felons
'
bar
)
,
his
courage
took
the
shape
of
presence
of
mind
,
and
he
awaited
the
examination
with
a
calm
,
unflinching
intelligence
,
which
dictated
the
clearest
and
most
pertinent
answers
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
the
story
you
know
<EOS>
so
well
:
how
his
leave
of
absence
being
nearly
expired
,
he
had
resolved
to
fulfil
his
promise
,
and
go
to
see
an
uncle
residing
in
the
Isle
of
Man
;
how
his
money
(
sailor
-
like
)
was
all
expended
in
Manchester
,
and
how
,
consequently
,
it
had
been
necessary
for
him
to
walk
to
Liverpool
,
which
he
had
accordingly
done
on
the
very
night
of
the
murder
,
accompanied
as
far
as
Hollins
Green
by
his
friend
and
cousin
,
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
clear
and
distinct
in
every
corroborative
circumstance
,
and
gave
a
short
account
of
the
singular
way
in
which
he
had
been
recalled
from
his
outward
-
bound
voyage
,
and
the
terrible
anxiety
he
had
felt
,
as
the
pilot
-
boat
had
struggled
home
against
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
The
jury
felt
that
their
opinion
(
so
nearly
decided
half
-
an
-
hour
ago
)
was
shaken
and
disturbed
in
a
very
uncomfortable
and
perplexing
way
,
and
were
almost
grateful
to
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
,
when
he
got
up
,
with
a
brow
of
thunder
,
to
demolish
the
evidence
,
which
was
so
bewildering
when
taken
in
connection
with
everything
previously
adduced
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
such
,
without
looking
to
the
consequences
,
was
the
first
impulsive
feeling
of
some
among
the
jury
<EOS>
,
how
shall
I
describe
the
vehemence
of
passion
which
possessed
the
mind
of
poor
Mr.
Carson
,
as
he
saw
the
effect
of
the
young
sailor
's
statement
?
 
<EOS>
It
never
shook
his
belief
in
Jem
's
guilt
in
the
least
,
that
attempt
at
an
alibi
;
his
hatred
,
his
longing
for
vengeance
,
having
once
defined
an
object
to
itself
,
could
no
more
bear
to
be
frustrated
and
disappointed
than
the
beast
of
prey
can
submit
to
have
his
victim
taken
from
his
hungry
jaws
.
 
<EOS>
No
more
likeness
to
the
calm
stern
power
of
Jupiter
was
there
in
that
white
eager
face
,
almost
distorted
by
its
fell
anxiety
of
expression
.
  
<EOS>
The
counsel
to
whom
etiquette
assigned
the
cross
-
examination
of
Will
,
caught
the
look
on
Mr.
Carson
's
face
,
and
in
his
desire
to
further
the
intense
wish
there
manifested
,
he
over
-
shot
his
mark
even
in
his
first
insulting
question
   
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
man
,
you
've
told
the
court
a
very
good
and
very
convincing
story
;
no
reasonable
man
ought
to
doubt
the
unstained
innocence
of
your
relation
at
the
bar
.
 
<EOS>
Still
there
is
one
circumstance
you
have
forgotten
to
name
;
and
I
feel
that
without
it
your
evidence
is
rather
incomplete
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
have
the
kindness
to
inform
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
what
has
been
your
charge
for
repeating
this
very
plausible
story
?
 
<EOS>
How
much
good
coin
of
Her
Majesty
's
realm
have
you
received
,
or
are
you
to
receive
,
for
walking
up
from
the
docks
,
or
some
less
credible
place
,
and
uttering
the
tale
you
have
just
now
repeated
,
 
very
much
to
the
credit
of
your
instructor
,
I
must
say
?
 
<EOS>
Remember
,
sir
,
you
are
upon
oath
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
took
Will
a
minute
to
extract
the
meaning
from
the
garb
of
unaccustomed
words
in
which
it
was
invested
,
and
during
this
time
he
looked
a
little
confused
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
instant
the
truth
flashed
upon
him
<EOS>
he
fixed
his
bright
clear
eyes
,
flaming
with
indignation
,
upon
the
counsellor
,
whose
look
fell
at
last
before
that
stern
unflinching
gaze
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
and
not
till
then
,
Will
made
answer
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
tell
the
judge
and
jury
how
much
money
you
've
been
paid
for
your
impudence
towards
one
who
has
told
God
's
blessed
truth
,
and
who
would
scorn
to
tell
a
lie
,
or
blackguard
any
one
,
for
the
biggest
fee
as
ever
lawyer
got
for
doing
dirty
work
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
tell
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
'm
ready
,
my
lord
judge
,
to
take
my
oath
as
many
times
as
your
lordship
or
the
jury
would
like
,
to
testify
to
things
having
happened
just
as
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
O'Brien
,
the
pilot
,
in
court
now
.
<EOS>
Would
somebody
with
a
wig
on
please
to
ask
him
how
much
he
can
say
for
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
good
idea
,
and
caught
at
by
the
counsel
for
the
defence
.
<EOS>
O'Brien
gave
just
such
testimony
as
was
required
to
clear
Will
from
all
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
witnessed
the
pursuit
,
he
had
heard
the
conversation
which
took
place
between
the
boat
and
the
ship
;
he
had
given
Will
a
homeward
passage
in
his
boat
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
character
of
an
accredited
pilot
,
appointed
by
the
Trinity
House
,
was
known
to
be
above
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
sank
back
on
his
seat
in
sickening
despair
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
enough
of
courts
to
be
aware
of
the
extreme
unwillingness
of
juries
to
convict
,
even
where
the
evidence
is
most
clear
,
when
the
penalty
of
such
conviction
is
death
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
period
of
the
trial
most
condemnatory
to
the
prisoner
,
he
had
repeated
this
fact
to
himself
,
in
order
to
damp
his
too
certain
expectation
for
a
conviction
.
 
<EOS>
Now
it
needed
not
repetition
,
for
it
forced
itself
upon
his
consciousness
,
and
he
seemed
to
KNOW
,
even
before
the
jury
retired
to
consult
,
that
by
some
trick
,
some
negligence
,
some
miserable
hocus
-
pocus
,
the
murderer
of
his
child
,
his
darling
,
his
Absalom
,
who
had
never
rebelled
 
the
slayer
of
his
unburied
boy
would
slip
through
the
fangs
of
justice
,
and
walk
free
and
unscathed
over
that
earth
where
his
son
would
never
more
be
seen
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
even
so
.
 
<EOS>
The
prisoner
hid
his
face
once
more
to
shield
the
expression
of
an
emotion
he
could
not
control
,
from
the
notice
of
the
over
-
curious
;
Job
Legh
ceased
his
eager
talking
to
Mr.
Bridgnorth
;
Charley
looked
grave
and
earnest
;
for
the
jury
filed
one
by
one
back
into
their
box
,
and
the
question
was
asked
to
which
such
an
awful
answer
might
be
given
.
  
<EOS>
The
verdict
they
had
come
to
was
unsatisfactory
to
themselves
at
last
;
neither
being
convinced
of
his
innocence
,
nor
yet
quite
willing
to
believe
him
guilty
in
the
teeth
of
the
alibi
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
punishment
that
awaited
him
,
if
guilty
,
was
so
terrible
,
and
so
unnatural
a
sentence
for
man
to
pronounce
on
man
,
that
the
knowledge
of
it
had
weighed
down
the
scale
on
the
side
of
innocence
,
and
"
Not
Guilty
"
was
the
verdict
that
thrilled
through
the
breathless
court
.
  
<EOS>
One
moment
of
silence
,
<EOS>
and
then
the
murmurs
rose
,
as
the
verdict
was
discussed
by
all
with
lowered
voice
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
stood
motionless
,
his
head
bowed
;
poor
fellow
,
he
was
stunned
with
the
rapid
career
of
events
during
the
last
few
hours
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
assumed
his
place
at
the
bar
with
little
or
no
expectation
of
an
acquittal
;
and
with
scarcely
any
desire
for
life
,
in
the
complication
of
occurrences
tending
to
strengthen
the
idea
of
Mary
's
more
than
indifference
to
him
;
she
had
loved
another
,
and
in
her
mind
Jem
believed
that
he
himself
must
be
regarded
as
the
murderer
of
him
she
loved
.
 
<EOS>
And
suddenly
,
athwart
this
gloom
which
made
life
seem
such
a
blank
expanse
of
desolation
,
there
flashed
the
exquisite
delight
of
hearing
Mary
's
avowal
of
love
,
making
the
future
all
glorious
,
if
a
future
in
this
world
he
might
hope
to
have
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
dwell
on
anything
but
her
words
,
telling
of
her
passionate
love
;
all
else
was
indistinct
,
nor
could
he
strive
to
make
it
otherwise
.
<EOS>
She
loved
him
.
  
<EOS>
And
life
,
now
full
of
tender
images
,
suddenly
bright
with
all
exquisite
promises
,
hung
on
a
breath
,
the
slenderest
gossamer
chance
.
 
<EOS>
He
tried
to
think
that
the
knowledge
of
her
love
would
soothe
him
even
in
his
dying
hours
;
but
the
phantoms
of
what
life
with
her
might
be
would
obtrude
,
and
made
him
almost
gasp
and
reel
under
the
uncertainty
he
was
enduring
.
 
<EOS>
Will
's
appearance
had
only
added
to
the
intensity
of
this
suspense
.
  
<EOS>
The
full
meaning
of
the
verdict
could
not
at
once
penetrate
his
brain
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
dizzy
and
motionless
.
 
<EOS>
Some
one
pulled
his
coat
.
<EOS>
He
turned
,
and
saw
Job
Legh
,
the
tears
stealing
down
his
brown
furrowed
cheeks
,
while
he
tried
in
vain
to
command
voice
enough
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
He
kept
shaking
Jem
by
the
hand
,
as
the
best
and
necessary
expression
of
his
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
make
yourself
scarce
!
 
<EOS>
I
should
think
you
'd
be
glad
to
get
out
of
that
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
gaoler
,
as
he
brought
up
another
livid
prisoner
,
from
out
whose
eyes
came
the
anxiety
which
he
would
not
allow
any
other
feature
to
display
.
  
<EOS>
Job
Legh
pressed
out
of
court
,
and
Jem
followed
unreasoningly
.
  
<EOS>
The
crowd
made
way
,
and
kept
their
garments
tight
about
them
,
as
Jem
passed
,
for
about
him
there
still
hung
the
taint
of
the
murderer
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
open
air
,
and
free
once
more
!
 
<EOS>
Although
many
looked
on
him
with
suspicion
,
faithful
friends
closed
round
him
;
his
arm
was
unresistingly
pumped
up
and
down
by
his
cousin
and
Job
;
when
one
was
tired
,
the
other
took
up
the
wholesome
exercise
,
while
Ben
Sturgis
was
working
off
his
interest
in
the
scene
by
scolding
Charley
for
walking
on
his
head
round
and
round
Mary
's
sweetheart
,
for
a
sweetheart
he
was
now
satisfactorily
ascertained
to
be
,
in
spite
of
her
assertion
to
the
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
And
all
this
time
Jem
himself
felt
bewildered
and
dazzled
;
he
would
have
given
anything
for
an
hour
's
uninterrupted
thought
on
the
occurrences
of
the
past
week
,
and
<EOS>
the
new
visions
raised
up
during
the
morning
;
ay
,
even
though
that
tranquil
hour
were
to
be
passed
in
the
hermitage
of
his
quiet
prison
cell
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
question
sobbed
out
by
his
choking
voice
,
oppressed
with
emotion
,
was
   
<EOS>
"
Where
is
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
They
led
him
to
the
room
where
his
mother
sat
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
told
her
of
her
son
's
acquittal
,
and
now
she
was
laughing
,
and
crying
,
and
talking
,
and
giving
way
to
all
those
feelings
which
she
had
restrained
with
such
effort
during
the
last
few
days
.
 
<EOS>
They
brought
her
son
to
her
,
and
she
threw
herself
upon
his
neck
,
weeping
there
.
<EOS>
He
returned
her
embrace
,
but
looked
around
,
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
Excepting
his
mother
,
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
but
the
friends
who
had
entered
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
lad
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
when
she
found
voice
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
what
it
is
to
have
behaved
thysel
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
put
in
a
good
word
for
thee
,
and
the
jury
could
na
go
and
hang
thee
in
the
face
of
th
'
character
I
gave
thee
.
 
<EOS>
Was
na
it
a
good
thing
they
did
na
keep
me
from
Liverpool
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
would
come
;
I
knew
I
could
do
thee
good
,
bless
thee
,
my
lad
.
 
<EOS>
But
thou'rt
very
white
,
and
all
of
a
tremble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
kissed
her
again
and
again
,
but
looking
round
as
if
searching
for
some
one
he
could
not
find
,
the
first
words
he
uttered
were
still
   
<EOS>
"
Where
is
she
?
"
   
<EOS>
REQUIESCAT
IN
PACE
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fear
no
more
<EOS>
the

Nor
the
furious
winter
's
rages

<EOS>

While

can

Or

For

When

grim

Comes

The

BURNS
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
where
no
words
of
peace
,
no
soothing
hopeful
tidings
could
reach
her
;
in
the
ghastly
spectral
world
of
delirium
.
 
<EOS>
Hour
after
hour
,
day
after
day
,
she
started
up
with
passionate
cries
on
her
father
to
save
Jem
;
or
rose
wildly
,
imploring
the
winds
and
waves
,
the
pitiless
winds
and
waves
,
to
have
mercy
;
and
over
and
over
again
she
exhausted
her
feverish
fitful
strength
in
these
agonised
entreaties
,
and
fell
back
powerless
,
uttering
only
the
wailing
moans
of
despair
.
 
<EOS>
They
told
her
Jem
was
safe
,
they
brought
him
before
her
eyes
;
but
sight
and
hearing
were
no
longer
channels
of
information
to
that
poor
distracted
brain
,
nor
could
human
voice
penetrate
to
her
understanding
.
  
<EOS>
Jem
alone
gathered
the
full
meaning
of
some
of
her
strange
sentences
,
and
perceived
that
,
by
some
means
or
other
,
she
,
like
himself
,
had
divined
the
truth
of
her
father
being
the
murderer
.
  
<EOS>
Long
ago
(
reckoning
time
by
events
and
thoughts
,
and
not
by
clock
or
dial
-
plate
)
,
Jem
had
felt
certain
that
Mary
's
father
was
Harry
Carson
's
murderer
;
and
although
the
motive
was
in
some
measure
a
mystery
,
yet
a
whole
train
of
circumstances
(
the
principal
of
which
was
that
John
Barton
had
borrowed
the
fatal
gun
only
two
days
before
)
<EOS>
had
left
no
doubt
in
Jem
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
thought
that
John
had
discovered
,
and
thus
bloodily
resented
,
the
attentions
which
Mr.
Carson
had
paid
to
his
daughter
;
at
others
,
he
believed
the
motive
to
exist
in
the
bitter
feuds
between
the
masters
and
their
work
-
people
,
in
which
Barton
was
known
to
take
so
keen
an
interest
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
he
had
felt
himself
pledged
to
preserve
this
secret
,
even
when
his
own
life
was
the
probable
penalty
,
and
he
believed
he
should
fall
execrated
by
Mary
as
the
guilty
destroyer
of
her
lover
,
how
much
more
was
he
bound
now
to
labour
to
prevent
any
word
of
hers
from
inculpating
her
father
,
now
that
she
was
his
own
;
now
that
she
had
braved
so
much
to
rescue
him
;
and
now
that
her
poor
brain
had
lost
all
guiding
and
controlling
power
over
her
words
.
  
<EOS>
All
that
night
long
Jem
wandered
up
and
down
the
narrow
precincts
of
Ben
Sturgis
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
little
bedroom
where
Mrs.
Sturgis
alternately
tended
Mary
,
and
wept
over
the
violence
of
her
illness
,
he
listened
to
her
ravings
;
each
sentence
of
which
had
its
own
peculiar
meaning
and
reference
,
intelligible
to
his
mind
,
till
her
words
rose
to
the
wild
pitch
of
agony
,
that
no
one
could
alleviate
,
and
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
,
and
stole
,
sick
and
miserable
,
downstairs
,
where
Ben
Sturgis
thought
it
his
duty
to
snore
away
in
an
arm
-
chair
instead
of
his
bed
,
under
the
idea
that
he
should
thus
be
more
ready
for
active
service
,
such
as
fetching
the
doctor
to
revisit
his
patient
.
  
<EOS>
Before
it
was
fairly
light
,
Jem
(
wide
awake
,
and
listening
with
an
earnest
attention
he
could
not
deaden
,
however
painful
its
results
proved
)
heard
a
gentle
subdued
knock
at
the
house
door
;
it
was
no
business
of
his
,
to
be
sure
,
to
open
it
,
but
as
Ben
slept
on
,
he
thought
he
would
see
who
the
early
visitor
might
be
,
and
ascertain
if
there
was
any
occasion
for
disturbing
either
host
or
hostess
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Job
Legh
who
stood
there
,
distinct
against
the
outer
light
of
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
she
?
 
<EOS>
Eh
!
<EOS>
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
is
that
her
?
 
<EOS>
No
need
to
ask
!
 
<EOS>
How
strange
her
voice
sounds
!
 
<EOS>
Screech
!
<EOS>
screech
!
<EOS>
and
she
so
low
,
sweet
-
spoken
,
when
she
's
well
!
 
<EOS>
Thou
must
keep
up
heart
,
old
boy
,
and
not
look
so
dismal
,
thysel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
Job
;
it
's
past
a
man
's
bearing
to
hear
such
a
one
as
she
is
,
going
on
as
she
is
doing
;
<EOS>
even
if
I
did
not
care
for
her
,
it
would
cut
me
sore
to
see
one
so
young
,
and
 
I
ca
n't
speak
of
it
,
Job
,
as
a
man
should
do
,
"
said
Jem
,
his
sobs
choking
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
in
,
will
you
?
"
said
Job
,
pushing
past
him
,
for
all
this
time
Jem
had
stood
holding
the
door
,
unwilling
to
admit
Job
where
he
might
hear
so
much
that
would
be
suggestive
to
one
acquainted
with
the
parties
that
Mary
named
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
more
than
one
reason
for
coming
betimes
.
 
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
hear
how
yon
poor
wench
was
 
that
stood
first
.
 
<EOS>
Late
last
night
I
got
a
letter
from
Margaret
,
<EOS>
very
anxious
-
like
.
 
<EOS>
The
doctor
says
the
old
lady
yonder
ca
n't
last
many
days
longer
,
and
it
seems
so
lonesome
for
her
to
die
with
no
one
but
Margaret
and
Mrs.
Davenport
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
thought
I
'd
just
come
and
stay
with
Mary
Barton
,
and
see
as
she
's
well
done
to
,
and
you
and
your
mother
and
Will
go
and
take
leave
of
old
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
's
countenance
,
sad
at
best
just
now
,
fell
lower
and
lower
.
 
<EOS>
But
Job
went
on
with
his
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
still
wanders
,
Margaret
says
,
and
thinks
she
's
with
her
mother
at
home
;
but
for
all
that
,
she
should
have
some
kith
and
kin
near
her
to
close
her
eyes
,
to
my
thinking
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Could
not
you
and
Will
take
mother
home
?
 
<EOS>
I
'd
follow
when
"
 
J
<EOS>
em
faltered
out
thus
far
,
when
Job
interrupted
   
<EOS>
"
Lad
!
<EOS>
if
thou
knew
what
thy
mother
has
suffered
for
thee
,
thou'd
not
speak
of
leaving
her
just
when
she
's
got
thee
from
the
grave
as
it
were
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
this
very
night
she
roused
me
up
,
and

Job
,
"
says
she
,
"
I
ask
your
pardon
for
wakening
you
,
but
tell
me
,
am
I
awake
or
dreaming
?
 
<EOS>
Is
Jem
proved
innocent
?
 
<EOS>
O
Job
Legh
!
 
<EOS>
God
send
I
've
not
been
only
dreaming
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
For
thou
see'st
<EOS>
she
ca
n't
rightly
understand
why
thou'rt
with
Mary
,
and
not
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
ay
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
why
;
but
a
mother
only
gives
up
her
son
's
heart
inch
by
inch
to
his
wife
,
and
then
she
gives
it
up
with
a
grudge
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
Jem
!
<EOS>
thou
must
go
with
thy
mother
just
now
,
if
ever
thou
hopest
for
God
's
blessing
.
<EOS>
She
's
a
widow
,
and
has
none
but
thee
.
 
<EOS>
Never
fear
for
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
She
's
young
,
and
will
struggle
through
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
decent
people
,
these
folk
she
is
with
,
and
I
'll
watch
o'er
her
as
though
she
was
my
own
poor
girl
,
that
lies
cold
enough
in
London
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
grant
ye
<EOS>
,
it
's
hard
enough
for
her
to
be
left
among
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
To
my
mind
,
John
Barton
would
be
more
in
the
way
of
his
duty
,
looking
after
his
daughter
,
than
delegating
it
up
and
down
the
country
,
looking
after
every
one
's
business
but
his
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
new
idea
and
a
new
fear
came
into
Jem
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
What
if
Mary
should
implicate
her
father
?
  
<EOS>
"
She
raves
terribly
,
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
night
long
she
's
been
speaking
of
her
father
,
and
mixing
up
thoughts
of
him
with
the
trial
she
saw
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
wonder
if
she
'll
speak
of
him
as
being
in
court
next
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
na
wonder
,
either
,
"
answered
Job
.
 
<EOS>
"
Folk
in
her
way
say
many
and
many
a
strange
thing
;
and
th
'
best
way
is
never
to
mind
them
.
 
<EOS>
Now
you
take
your
mother
home
,
Jem
,
and
stay
by
her
till
old
Alice
is
gone
,
and
trust
me
for
seeing
after
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
felt
how
right
Job
was
,
and
could
not
resist
what
he
knew
to
be
his
duty
,
but
I
can
not
tell
you
how
heavy
and
sick
at
heart
he
was
as
he
stood
at
the
door
to
take
a
last
fond
,
<EOS>
lingering
look
at
Mary
.
<EOS>
He
saw
her
sitting
up
in
bed
,
her
golden
hair
,
dimmed
with
her
one
day
's
illness
,
floating
behind
her
,
her
head
bound
round
with
wetted
cloths
,
her
features
all
agitated
,
even
to
distortion
,
with
the
pangs
of
her
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
Her
lover
's
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
hope
.
 
<EOS>
The
elasticity
of
his
heart
had
been
crushed
out
of
him
by
early
sorrows
;
and
now
,
especially
,
the
dark
side
of
everything
seemed
to
be
presented
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
What
if
she
died
,
just
when
he
knew
the
treasure
,
the
untold
treasure
he
possessed
in
her
love
!
 
<EOS>
What
if
(
worse
than
death
)
<EOS>
she
remained
a
poor
gibbering
maniac
all
her
life
long
(
and
mad
people
do
live
to
be
old
sometimes
,
even
under
all
the
pressure
of
their
burden
)
,
terror
-
distracted
as
she
was
now
,
and
no
one
able
to
comfort
her
!
  
<EOS>
"
Jem
,
"
said
Job
,
partly
guessing
the
other
's
feelings
by
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Jem
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
he
,
arresting
his
attention
before
he
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
turned
round
,
the
little
motion
causing
the
tears
to
overflow
and
trickle
down
his
cheeks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
must
trust
in
God
,
and
leave
her
in
His
hands
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
hushed
,
and
low
;
but
the
words
sank
all
the
more
into
Jem
's
heart
,
and
gave
him
strength
to
tear
himself
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
found
his
mother
(
notwithstanding
that
she
had
but
just
regained
her
child
through
Mary
's
instrumentality
)
half
inclined
to
resent
his
having
passed
the
night
in
anxious
devotion
to
the
poor
invalid
.
<EOS>
She
dwelt
on
the
duties
of
children
to
their
parents
(
above
all
others
)
,
till
Jem
could
hardly
believe
the
relative
positions
they
had
held
only
yesterday
,
when
she
was
struggling
with
and
controlling
every
instinct
of
her
nature
,
only
because
HE
wished
it
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
recollection
of
that
yesterday
,
with
its
hair's
-
breadth
between
him
and
a
felon
's
death
,
and
the
love
that
had
lightened
the
dark
shadow
,
made
him
bear
with
the
meekness
and
patience
of
a
true
-
hearted
man
all
the
worrying
little
acerbities
of
to
-
day
;
and
he
had
no
small
merit
in
doing
so
;
for
in
him
,
as
in
his
mother
,
the
reaction
after
intense
excitement
had
produced
its
usual
effect
in
increased
irritability
of
the
nervous
system
.
  
<EOS>
They
found
Alice
alive
,
and
without
pain
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
was
all
.
 
<EOS>
A
child
of
a
few
weeks
old
would
have
had
more
bodily
strength
;
a
child
of
a
very
few
months
old
,
more
consciousness
of
what
was
passing
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
even
in
this
state
she
diffused
an
atmosphere
of
peace
around
her
.
 
<EOS>
True
,
Will
,
at
first
,
wept
passionate
tears
at
the
sight
of
her
,
who
had
been
as
a
mother
to
him
,
so
standing
on
the
confines
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
But
even
now
,
as
always
,
loud
passionate
feeling
could
not
long
endure
in
the
calm
of
her
presence
.
 
<EOS>
The
firm
faith
which
her
mind
had
no
longer
power
to
grasp
,
had
left
its
trail
of
glory
;
for
by
no
other
word
can
I
call
the
bright
happy
look
which
illumined
the
old
earth
-
worn
face
.
 
<EOS>
Her
talk
,
it
is
true
,
bore
no
more
that
constant
earnest
reference
to
God
and
His
holy
Word
which
it
had
done
in
health
,
and
there
were
no
deathbed
words
of
exhortation
from
the
lips
of
one
so
habitually
pious
.
 
<EOS>
For
still
she
imagined
herself
once
again
in
the
happy
,
happy
realms
of
childhood
;
and
again
dwelling
in
the
lovely
northern
haunts
where
she
had
so
often
longed
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Though
earthly
sight
was
gone
away
,
she
beheld
again
the
scenes
she
had
loved
from
long
years
ago
!
<EOS>
she
saw
them
without
a
change
to
dim
the
old
radiant
hues
.
 
<EOS>
The
long
dead
were
with
her
,
fresh
and
blooming
as
in
those
bygone
days
.
 
<EOS>
And
death
came
to
her
as
a
welcome
blessing
,
like
as
evening
comes
to
the
weary
child
.
 
<EOS>
Her
work
here
was
finished
,
and
faithfully
done
.
  
<EOS>
What
better
sentence
can
an
emperor
wish
to
have
said
over
his
bier
?
<EOS>
In
second
childhood
(
that
blessing
clouded
by
a
name
)
,
she
said
her
"
Nunc
Dimittis
"
 
t
<EOS>
he
sweetest
canticle
to
the
holy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
good
-
night
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
mother
!
<EOS>
bless
me
once
more
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
very
tired
,
and
would
fain
go
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
never
spoke
again
on
this
side
heaven
.
  
<EOS>
She
died
the
day
after
their
return
from
Liverpool
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
time
,
Jem
became
aware
that
his
mother
was
jealously
watching
for
some
word
or
sign
which
should
betoken
his
wish
to
return
to
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
go
to
Liverpool
<EOS>
he
must
and
would
,
as
soon
as
the
funeral
was
over
,
if
but
for
a
simple
glimpse
of
his
darling
.
 
<EOS>
For
Job
had
never
written
;
indeed
,
any
necessity
for
his
so
doing
had
never
entered
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mary
died
,
he
would
announce
it
personally
;
if
she
recovered
,
he
meant
to
bring
her
home
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Writing
was
to
him
little
more
than
an
auxiliary
to
natural
history
;
a
way
of
ticketing
specimens
,
not
of
expressing
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
The
consequence
of
this
want
of
intelligence
as
to
Mary
's
state
was
,
that
Jem
was
constantly
anticipating
that
every
person
and
every
scrap
of
paper
was
to
convey
to
him
the
news
of
her
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
endure
this
state
long
;
but
he
resolved
not
to
disturb
the
house
by
announcing
to
his
mother
his
purposed
intention
of
returning
to
Liverpool
,
until
the
dead
had
been
buried
forth
.
  
<EOS>
On
Sunday
afternoon
they
laid
her
low
with
many
tears
.
 
<EOS>
Will
wept
as
one
who
would
not
be
comforted
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
childish
feeling
came
over
him
,
the
feeling
of
loneliness
at
being
left
among
strangers
.
  
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
,
Margaret
timidly
stole
near
him
,
as
if
waiting
to
console
;
and
soon
his
passion
sank
down
to
grief
,
and
grief
gave
way
to
melancholy
,
and
though
he
felt
as
if
he
never
could
be
joyful
again
,
he
was
all
the
while
unconsciously
approaching
nearer
to
the
full
happiness
of
calling
Margaret
his
own
,
and
a
golden
thread
was
interwoven
even
now
with
the
darkness
of
his
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
it
was
on
his
arm
that
Jane
Wilson
leant
on
her
return
homewards
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
took
charge
of
Margaret
.
  
<EOS>
"
Margaret
,
I
'm
bound
for
Liverpool
by
the
first
train
to
-
morrow
;
I
must
set
your
grandfather
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
he
likes
nothing
better
than
watching
over
poor
Mary
;
he
loves
her
nearly
as
well
as
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
let
me
go
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
so
full
of
poor
Alice
<EOS>
,
I
've
never
thought
of
it
before
;
I
ca
n't
do
so
much
as
many
a
one
,
but
Mary
will
like
to
have
a
woman
about
her
that
she
knows
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
I
waited
to
be
reminded
,
Jem
,
"
replied
Margaret
,
with
some
little
self
-
reproach
.
  
<EOS>
But
Margaret
's
proposition
did
not
at
all
agree
with
her
companion
's
wishes
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
he
had
better
speak
out
,
and
put
his
intention
at
once
to
the
right
motive
;
the
subterfuge
about
setting
Job
Legh
at
liberty
had
done
him
harm
instead
of
good
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
tell
truth
,
Margaret
,
it
's
I
that
must
go
,
and
that
for
my
own
sake
,
not
your
grandfather
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
rest
neither
by
night
nor
day
for
thinking
on
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
she
lives
or
dies
,
I
look
on
her
as
my
wife
before
God
,
as
surely
and
solemnly
as
if
we
were
married
.
<EOS>
So
being
,
I
have
the
greatest
right
to
look
after
her
,
and
I
can
not
yield
it
even
to
"
    
"
Her
father
,
"
said
Margaret
,
finishing
his
interrupted
sentence
.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
strange
that
a
girl
like
her
should
be
thrown
on
the
bare
world
to
struggle
through
so
bad
an
illness
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
seems
to
know
where
John
Barton
is
,
else
I
thought
of
getting
Morris
to
write
him
a
letter
telling
him
about
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
he
was
home
,
that
I
do
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
could
not
echo
this
wish
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
's
not
bad
off
for
friends
where
she
is
,
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
call
them
friends
,
though
a
week
ago
we
none
of
us
knew
there
were
such
folks
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
But
being
anxious
and
sorrowful
about
the
same
thing
makes
people
friends
quicker
than
anything
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
like
a
mother
to
Mary
in
her
ways
;
and
he
bears
a
good
character
,
as
far
as
I
could
learn
just
in
that
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
We
're
drawing
near
home
,
and
<EOS>
I
've
not
said
my
say
,
Margaret
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
look
after
mother
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
She
'll
not
like
my
going
,
and
I
've
got
to
break
it
to
her
yet
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
takes
it
very
badly
,
I
'll
come
back
to
-
morrow
night
;
but
if
she
's
not
against
it
very
much
,
I
mean
to
stay
till
it
's
settled
about
Mary
,
one
way
or
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Will
,
you
know
,
will
be
there
,
Margaret
,
to
help
a
bit
in
doing
for
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Will
's
being
there
made
the
only
objection
Margaret
saw
to
this
plan
.
 
<EOS>
She
disliked
the
idea
of
seeming
to
throw
herself
in
his
way
,
and
yet
she
did
not
like
to
say
anything
of
this
feeling
to
Jem
,
who
had
all
along
seemed
perfectly
unconscious
of
any
love
-
affair
,
besides
his
own
,
in
progress
.
  
<EOS>
So
Margaret
gave
a
reluctant
consent
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
can
just
step
up
to
our
house
to
-
night
,
Jem
,
I
'll
put
up
a
few
things
as
may
be
useful
to
Mary
,
and
then
you
can
say
when
you
'll
likely
be
back
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
come
home
to
-
morrow
night
,
and
Will
's
there
,
perhaps
I
need
not
step
up
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Margaret
,
do
!
 
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
leave
easy
unless
you
go
some
time
in
the
day
to
see
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
come
to
-
night
,
though
;
and
now
good
-
bye
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
!
<EOS>
do
you
think
you
could
just
coax
poor
Will
to
walk
a
bit
home
with
you
,
that
I
might
speak
to
mother
by
myself
?
"
  
<EOS>
No
!
that
Margaret
could
not
do
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
expecting
too
great
a
sacrifice
of
bashful
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
object
was
accomplished
by
Will
's
going
upstairs
immediately
on
their
return
to
the
house
,
to
indulge
his
mournful
thoughts
alone
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Jem
and
his
mother
were
left
by
themselves
,
he
began
on
the
subject
uppermost
in
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
put
her
handkerchief
from
her
eyes
,
and
turned
quickly
round
so
as
to
face
him
where
he
stood
,
thinking
what
best
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
action
annoyed
him
,
and
he
rushed
at
once
into
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
back
to
Liverpool
to
-
morrow
morning
to
see
how
Mary
Barton
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
's
Mary
Barton
to
thee
,
that
thou
shouldst
be
running
after
her
in
that
-
a
-
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
she
lives
,
she
shall
be
my
wedded
wife
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
dies
 
mother
,
I
ca
n't
speak
of
what
I
shall
feel
if
she
dies
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
voice
was
choked
in
his
throat
.
  
<EOS>
For
an
instant
his
mother
was
interested
by
his
words
;
and
then
came
back
the
old
jealousy
of
being
supplanted
in
the
affections
of
that
son
,
who
had
been
,
as
it
were
,
newly
born
to
her
,
by
the
escape
he
had
so
lately
experienced
from
danger
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
hardened
her
heart
against
entertaining
any
feeling
of
sympathy
;
and
turned
away
from
the
face
,
which
recalled
the
earnest
look
of
his
childhood
,
when
he
had
come
to
her
in
some
trouble
,
sure
of
help
and
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
And
coldly
she
spoke
,
in
those
tones
which
Jem
knew
and
dreaded
,
even
before
the
meaning
they
expressed
was
fully
shaped
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou'rt
old
enough
to
please
thysel
.
 
<EOS>
Old
mothers
are
cast
aside
,
and
what
they
've
borne
forgotten
,
as
soon
as
a
pretty
face
comes
across
.
 
<EOS>
I
might
have
thought
of
that
last
Tuesday
,
when
I
felt
as
if
thou
wert
all
my
own
,
and
the
judge
were
some
wild
animal
trying
to
rend
thee
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
spoke
up
for
thee
then
;
but
it
's
all
forgotten
now
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mother
!
<EOS>
you
know
all
this
while
,
YOU
KNOW
I
can
never
forget
any
kindness
you
've
ever
done
for
me
;
and
they
've
been
many
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
you
think
I
've
only
room
for
one
love
in
my
heart
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
love
you
as
dearly
as
ever
,
and
Mary
too
,
as
much
as
man
ever
loved
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
awaited
a
reply
.
 
<EOS>
None
was
vouchsafed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
answer
me
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
mun
I
answer
?
 
<EOS>
You
asked
me
no
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
ask
you
this
now
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
morning
I
go
to
Liverpool
to
see
her
who
is
as
my
wife
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
mother
!
<EOS>
will
you
bless
me
on
my
errand
?
 
<EOS>
If
it
please
God
<EOS>
she
recovers
,
will
you
take
her
to
you
as
you
would
a
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
neither
refuse
nor
assent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
need
you
go
?
"
said
she
querulously
,
at
length
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
getting
in
some
mischief
or
another
again
.
 
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
stop
at
home
quiet
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
got
up
,
and
walked
about
the
room
in
despairing
impatience
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
not
understand
his
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
stopped
right
before
the
place
where
she
was
sitting
,
with
an
air
of
injured
meekness
on
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
 
<EOS>
I
often
think
what
a
good
man
father
was
!
 
<EOS>
I
've
often
heard
you
tell
of
your
courting
days
;
and
of
the
accident
that
befell
you
,
and
how
ill
you
were
.
 
<EOS>
How
long
is
it
ago
?
"
  
"
Near
upon
five
-
and
-
twenty
years
,
"
said
she
,
with
a
sigh
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
little
thought
when
you
were
so
ill
you
should
live
to
have
such
a
fine
strapping
son
as
I
am
,
did
you
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
smiled
a
little
and
looked
up
at
him
,
which
was
just
what
he
wanted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou'rt
not
so
fine
a
man
as
thy
father
was
,
by
a
deal
,
"
said
she
,
looking
at
him
with
much
fondness
,
notwithstanding
her
depreciatory
words
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
another
turn
or
two
up
and
down
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
wanted
to
bend
the
subject
round
to
his
own
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
Those
were
happy
days
when
father
was
alive
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
so
,
lad
!
 
<EOS>
Such
days
as
will
never
come
again
to
me
,
at
any
rate
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
sighed
sorrowfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
"
said
he
at
last
,
stopping
short
,
and
taking
her
hand
in
his
with
tender
affection
,
"
you
'd
like
me
to
be
as
happy
<EOS>
a
man
as
my
father
was
before
me
,
would
not
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
'd
like
me
to
have
some
one
to
make
me
as
happy
as
you
made
father
?
 
<EOS>
Now
,
would
you
not
,
dear
mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
make
him
as
happy
as
I
might
ha
'
done
,
"
murmured
she
,
in
a
low
,
sad
voice
of
self
-
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
"
Th
'
accident
gave
a
jar
to
my
temper
<EOS>
it
's
never
got
the
better
of
;
and
now
he
's
gone
where
he
can
never
know
how
I
grieve
for
having
frabbed
him
as
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
mother
,
we
do
n't
know
that
!
"
said
Jem
,
with
gentle
soothing
.
<EOS>
"
Anyhow
,
you
and
father
got
along
with
as
few
rubs
as
most
people
.
<EOS>
But
for
HIS
sake
,
dear
mother
,
do
n't
say
me
nay
,
now
that
I
come
to
you
to
ask
your
blessing
before
setting
out
to
see
her
,
who
is
to
be
my
wife
,
if
ever
woman
is
;
for
HIS
sake
,
if
not
for
mine
,
love
her
whom
I
shall
bring
home
to
be
to
me
all
you
were
to
him
:
and
,
mother
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
ask
for
a
truer
or
a
tenderer
heart
than
yours
is
,
in
the
long
run
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
hard
look
left
her
face
;
though
her
eyes
were
still
averted
from
Jem
's
gaze
,
it
was
more
because
they
were
brimming
over
with
tears
,
called
forth
by
his
words
,
than
because
any
angry
feeling
yet
remained
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
his
manly
voice
died
away
in
low
pleadings
,
she
lifted
up
her
hands
,
and
bent
down
her
son
's
head
below
the
level
of
her
own
;
and
then
she
solemnly
uttered
a
blessing
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
thee
,
Jem
,
my
own
dear
lad
.
 
<EOS>
And
may
He
bless
Mary
Barton
for
thy
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
Jem
's
heart
leapt
up
,
and
from
this
time
hope
took
the
place
of
fear
in
his
anticipations
with
regard
to
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
<EOS>
you
show
your
own
true
self
to
Mary
,
and
she
'll
love
you
as
dearly
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
with
some
few
smiles
,
and
some
few
tears
,
and
much
earnest
talking
,
the
evening
wore
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
be
off
to
see
Margaret
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
it
's
near
ten
o'clock
!
 
<EOS>
Could
you
have
thought
it
?
 
<EOS>
Now
do
n't
you
stop
up
for
me
,
mother
.
 
<EOS>
You
and
Will
go
to
bed
,
for
you
've
both
need
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
home
in
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Margaret
had
felt
the
evening
long
and
lonely
;
and
was
all
but
giving
up
the
thoughts
of
<EOS>
Jem
's
coming
that
night
,
when
she
heard
his
step
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
He
told
her
of
his
progress
with
his
mother
;
he
told
her
his
hopes
and
was
silent
on
the
subject
of
his
fears
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
think
how
sorrow
and
joy
are
mixed
up
together
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
date
your
start
in
life
as
Mary
's
acknowledged
lover
from
poor
Alice
Wilson
's
burial
day
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
the
dead
are
soon
forgotten
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
Dear
Margaret
!
 
<EOS>
But
you
're
worn
-
out
with
your
long
evening
waiting
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
But
never
you
,
nor
any
one
else
,
think
because
God
sees
fit
to
call
up
new
interests
,
perhaps
right
out
of
the
grave
,
that
therefore
the
dead
are
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
,
you
yourself
can
remember
our
looks
,
and
fancy
what
we
're
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
remembering
Alice
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
just
this
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
not
always
trying
to
think
on
our
faces
,
and
making
a
labour
of
remembering
;
but
often
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
when
you
're
sinking
off
to
sleep
,
or
when
you
're
very
quiet
and
still
,
the
faces
you
knew
so
well
when
you
could
see
,
come
smiling
before
you
with
loving
looks
.
 
<EOS>
Or
you
remember
them
,
without
striving
after
it
,
and
without
thinking
it
's
your
duty
to
keep
recalling
them
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
it
is
with
them
that
are
hidden
from
our
sight
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
've
been
worthy
to
be
heartily
loved
while
alive
,
they
'll
not
be
forgotten
when
dead
;
it
's
against
nature
.
 
<EOS>
And
we
need
no
more
be
upbraiding
ourselves
for
letting
in
God
's
rays
of
light
upon
our
sorrow
,
and
no
more
be
fearful
of
forgetting
them
,
because
their
memory
is
not
always
haunting
and
taking
up
our
minds
,
than
you
need
to
trouble
yourself
about
remembering
your
grandfather
's
face
,
or
what
the
stars
were
like
 
<EOS>
you
ca
n't
forget
if
you
would
,
what
it
's
such
a
pleasure
to
think
about
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
fear
my
forgetting
Aunt
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
,
Jem
;
not
now
,
at
least
;
only
you
seemed
so
full
about
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
kept
it
down
so
long
,
remember
.
 
<EOS>
How
glad
Aunt
Alice
would
have
been
to
know
that
I
might
hope
to
have
her
for
my
wife
!
<EOS>
that
's
to
say
,
if
God
spares
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
not
have
known
it
,
even
if
you
could
have
told
her
this
last
fortnight
 
ever
since
you
went
away
she
's
been
thinking
always
that
she
was
a
little
child
at
her
mother
's
apron
-
string
.
 
<EOS>
She
must
have
been
a
happy
little
thing
;
it
was
such
a
pleasure
to
her
to
think
about
those
early
days
,
when
she
lay
old
and
grey
on
her
deathbed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
knew
any
one
seem
more
happy
all
her
life
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
and
how
gentle
and
easy
her
death
was
!
 
<EOS>
She
thought
her
mother
was
near
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
fell
into
calm
thought
above
those
last
peaceful
,
happy
hours
.
  
<EOS>
It
struck
eleven
.
  
<EOS>
Jem
started
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
been
gone
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
the
bundle
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
not
forget
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
Margaret
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
let
him
out
and
bolted
the
door
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
on
the
steps
to
adjust
some
fastening
about
the
bundle
.
 
<EOS>
The
court
,
the
street
,
was
deeply
still
.
 
<EOS>
Long
ago
all
had
retired
to
rest
on
that
quiet
Sabbath
evening
.
 
<EOS>
The
stars
shone
down
on
the
silent
deserted
streets
,
and
the
clear
soft
moonlight
fell
in
bright
masses
,
leaving
the
steps
on
which
Jem
stood
in
shadow
.
  
<EOS>
A
footfall
was
heard
along
the
pavement
;
slow
and
heavy
was
the
sound
.
 
<EOS>
Before
Jem
had
ended
his
little
piece
of
business
,
a
form
had
glided
into
sight
;
a
wan
,
feeble
figure
,
bearing
with
evident
and
painful
labour
a
jug
of
water
from
a
neighbouring
pump
.
 
<EOS>
It
went
before
Jem
,
turned
up
the
court
at
the
corner
of
which
he
was
standing
,
passed
into
the
broad
,
calm
light
;
and
there
,
with
bowed
head
,
sinking
and
shrunk
body
,
Jem
recognised
John
Barton
.
  
<EOS>
No
haunting
ghost
could
have
had
less
of
the
energy
of
life
in
its
involuntary
motions
than
he
,
who
,
nevertheless
,
went
on
with
the
same
measured
clockwork
tread
until
the
door
of
his
own
house
was
reached
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
he
disappeared
,
and
the
latch
fell
feebly
to
,
and
made
a
faint
and
wavering
sound
,
breaking
the
solemn
silence
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
Then
all
again
was
still
.
  
<EOS>
For
a
minute
or
two
Jem
stood
motionless
,
stunned
by
the
thoughts
which
the
sight
of
Mary
's
father
had
called
up
.
  
<EOS>
Margaret
did
not
know
he
was
at
home
:
had
he
stolen
like
a
thief
by
dead
of
night
into
his
own
dwelling
?
 
<EOS>
Depressed
as
Jem
had
often
and
long
seen
him
<EOS>
,
this
night
there
was
something
different
about
him
still
;
beaten
down
by
some
inward
storm
,
he
seemed
to
grovel
along
,
all
self
-
respect
lost
and
gone
.
  
<EOS>
Must
he
be
told
of
Mary
's
state
?
 
<EOS>
Jem
felt
he
must
not
;
and
this
for
many
reasons
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
informed
of
her
illness
without
many
other
particulars
being
communicated
at
the
same
time
,
of
which
it
were
better
he
should
be
kept
in
ignorance
;
indeed
,
of
which
Mary
herself
could
alone
give
the
full
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
No
suspicion
that
he
was
the
criminal
seemed
hitherto
to
have
been
excited
in
the
mind
of
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
Added
to
these
reasons
was
Jem
's
extreme
unwillingness
to
face
him
,
with
the
belief
in
his
breast
that
he
,
and
none
other
,
had
done
the
fearful
deed
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
he
was
Mary
's
father
,
and
as
such
had
every
right
to
be
told
of
all
concerning
her
;
but
supposing
he
were
,
and
that
he
followed
the
impulse
so
natural
to
a
father
,
and
wished
to
go
to
her
<EOS>
,
what
might
be
the
consequences
?
 
<EOS>
Among
the
mingled
feelings
she
had
revealed
in
her
delirium
,
ay
,
mingled
even
with
the
most
tender
expressions
of
love
for
her
father
,
was
a
sort
of
horror
of
him
;
a
dread
of
him
as
a
blood
-
shedder
,
which
seemed
to
separate
him
into
two
persons
,
 
one
,
the
father
who
had
dandled
her
on
his
knee
,
and
loved
her
all
her
life
long
;
the
other
,
the
assassin
,
the
cause
of
all
her
trouble
and
woe
.
  
<EOS>
If
he
presented
himself
before
her
while
this
idea
of
his
character
was
uppermost
,
who
might
tell
the
consequence
?
  
<EOS>
Jem
could
not
,
and
would
not
,
expose
her
to
any
such
fearful
chance
:
and
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
believe
he
looked
upon
her
as
more
his
own
,
to
guard
from
all
shadow
of
injury
with
most
loving
care
,
than
as
belonging
to
any
one
else
in
this
world
,
though
girt
with
the
reverend
name
of
Father
,
and
guiltless
of
aught
that
might
have
lessened
such
reverence
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
think
this
account
of
mine
confused
,
of
the
half
-
feelings
,
half
-
reasons
,
which
passed
through
Jem
's
mind
,
as
he
stood
gazing
on
the
empty
space
,
where
that
crushed
form
had
so
lately
been
seen
,
 
if
you
are
perplexed
to
disentangle
the
real
motives
,
I
do
assure
you
it
was
from
just
such
an
involved
set
of
thoughts
that
Jem
drew
the
resolution
to
act
as
if
he
had
not
seen
that
phantom
likeness
of
John
Barton
;
himself
,
yet
not
himself
.

ELLIOT

<EOS>
Mary
still
hovered
between
life
and
death
when
Jem
arrived
at
the
house
where
she
lay
;
and
the
doctors
were
as
yet
unwilling
to
compromise
their
wisdom
by
allowing
too
much
hope
to
be
entertained
.
<EOS>
But
the
state
of
things
,
if
not
less
anxious
,
was
less
distressing
than
when
Jem
had
quitted
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
lay
now
in
a
stupor
,
which
was
partly
disease
,
and
partly
exhaustion
after
the
previous
excitement
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
Jem
found
the
difficulty
which
every
one
who
has
watched
by
a
sick
-
bed
knows
full
well
;
and
which
is
perhaps
more
insurmountable
to
men
than
it
is
to
women
,
 
the
difficulty
of
being
patient
,
and
trying
not
to
expect
any
visible
change
for
long
,
long
hours
of
sad
monotony
.
  
<EOS>
But
after
a
while
the
reward
came
.
 
<EOS>
The
laboured
breathing
became
lower
and
softer
,
the
heavy
look
of
oppressive
pain
melted
away
from
the
face
,
and
a
languor
that
was
almost
peace
took
the
place
of
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
She
slept
a
natural
sleep
;
and
they
stole
about
on
tiptoe
,
and
spoke
low
,
and
softly
,
and
hardly
dared
to
breathe
,
however
much
they
longed
to
sigh
out
their
thankful
relief
.
  
<EOS>
She
opened
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mind
was
in
the
tender
state
of
a
lately
born
infant
's
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
pleased
with
the
gay
but
not
dazzling
colours
of
the
paper
;
soothed
by
the
subdued
light
;
and
quite
sufficiently
amused
by
looking
at
all
the
objects
in
the
room
 
the
drawing
of
the
ships
,
the
festoons
of
the
curtain
,
the
bright
flowers
on
the
painted
backs
of
the
chairs
 
to
care
for
any
stronger
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
She
wondered
at
the
ball
of
glass
,
containing
various
coloured
sands
from
the
Isle
of
Wight
,
or
some
other
place
,
which
hung
suspended
from
the
middle
of
the
little
valance
over
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
did
not
care
to
exert
herself
to
ask
any
questions
,
although
she
saw
Mrs.
Sturgis
standing
at
the
bedside
with
some
tea
,
ready
to
drop
it
into
her
mouth
by
spoonfuls
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
see
the
face
of
honest
joy
,
of
earnest
thankfulness
,
 
the
clasped
hands
,
the
beaming
eyes
,
 
the
trembling
eagerness
of
gesture
,
of
one
who
had
long
awaited
her
awakening
,
and
who
now
stood
behind
the
curtains
watching
through
some
little
chink
her
every
faint
motion
;
or
if
she
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
that
loving
,
peeping
face
,
she
was
in
too
exhausted
a
state
to
have
taken
much
notice
,
or
have
long
retained
the
impression
that
he
she
loved
<EOS>
so
well
was
hanging
about
her
,
and
blessing
God
for
every
conscious
look
which
stole
over
her
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
She
fell
softly
into
slumber
,
without
a
word
having
been
spoken
by
any
one
during
that
half
-
hour
of
inexpressible
joy
.
 
<EOS>
And
again
the
stillness
was
enforced
by
a
sign
and
whispered
word
,
but
with
eyes
that
beamed
out
their
bright
thoughts
of
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
sat
by
the
side
of
the
bed
,
holding
back
the
little
curtain
,
and
gazing
as
if
he
could
never
gaze
his
fill
at
the
pale
,
wasted
face
,
so
marbled
and
so
chiselled
in
its
wan
outline
.
  
<EOS>
She
wakened
once
more
;
her
soft
eyes
opened
,
and
met
his
overbending
look
.
 
<EOS>
She
smiled
gently
,
as
a
baby
does
when
it
sees
its
mother
tending
its
little
cot
;
and
continued
her
innocent
,
infantine
gaze
into
his
face
,
as
if
the
sight
gave
her
much
unconscious
pleasure
.
<EOS>
But
by
-
and
-
by
a
different
expression
came
into
her
sweet
eyes
;
a
look
of
memory
and
intelligence
;
her
white
flesh
flushed
the
brightest
rosy
red
,
and
with
feeble
motion
she
tried
to
hide
her
head
in
the
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
It
required
all
Jem
's
self
-
control
to
do
what
he
knew
and
felt
to
be
necessary
,
to
call
Mrs.
Sturgis
,
who
was
quietly
dozing
by
the
fireside
;
and
that
done
,
he
felt
almost
obliged
to
leave
the
room
to
keep
down
the
happy
agitation
which
would
gush
out
in
every
feature
,
every
gesture
,
and
every
tone
.
  
<EOS>
From
that
time
forward
Mary
's
progress
towards
health
was
rapid
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
every
reason
,
but
one
,
in
favour
of
her
speedy
removal
home
.
 
<EOS>
All
Jem
's
duties
lay
in
Manchester
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
his
mother
's
dwelling
-
place
,
and
there
his
plans
for
life
had
been
to
be
worked
out
;
<EOS>
plans
which
the
suspicion
and
imprisonment
he
had
fallen
into
,
had
thrown
for
a
time
into
a
chaos
,
which
his
presence
was
required
to
arrange
into
form
.
 
<EOS>
For
he
might
find
,
in
spite
of
a
jury
's
verdict
,
that
too
strong
a
taint
was
on
his
character
for
him
ever
to
labour
in
Manchester
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
remembered
the
manner
in
which
some
one
suspected
of
having
been
a
convict
was
shunned
by
masters
and
men
,
when
he
had
accidentally
met
with
work
in
their
foundry
;
the
recollection
smote
him
now
,
how
he
himself
had
thought
it
did
not
become
an
honest
upright
man
to
associate
with
one
who
had
been
a
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
choose
but
think
on
that
poor
humble
being
,
with
his
downcast
conscious
look
;
hunted
out
of
the
workshop
,
where
he
had
sought
to
earn
an
honest
livelihood
,
by
the
looks
,
and
half
-
spoken
words
,
and
the
black
silence
of
repugnance
(
worse
than
words
to
bear
)
,
that
met
him
on
all
sides
.
  
<EOS>
Jem
felt
that
his
own
character
had
been
attainted
;
and
that
to
many
it
might
still
appear
suspicious
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
could
convince
the
world
,
by
a
future
as
blameless
as
his
past
had
been
,
that
he
was
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
the
same
time
he
saw
that
he
must
have
patience
,
and
nerve
himself
for
some
trials
;
and
the
sooner
these
were
undergone
<EOS>
,
the
sooner
he
was
aware
of
the
place
he
held
in
men
's
estimation
,
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
He
longed
to
have
presented
himself
once
more
at
the
foundry
;
and
then
the
reality
would
drive
away
the
pictures
that
would
(
unbidden
)
come
of
a
shunned
man
,
eyed
askance
by
all
,
and
driven
forth
to
shape
out
some
new
career
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
every
reason
"
but
one
"
inclined
Jem
to
hasten
Mary
's
return
as
soon
as
she
was
sufficiently
convalescent
.
 
<EOS>
That
one
was
the
meeting
which
awaited
her
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
Turn
it
over
as
Jem
would
,
he
could
not
decide
what
was
the
best
course
to
pursue
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
compel
himself
to
any
line
of
conduct
that
his
reason
and
his
sense
of
right
told
him
to
be
desirable
;
but
they
did
not
tell
him
it
was
desirable
to
speak
to
Mary
,
in
her
tender
state
of
mind
and
body
,
of
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
How
much
would
be
implied
by
the
mere
mention
of
his
name
!
 
<EOS>
Speak
it
as
calmly
,
and
as
indifferently
as
he
might
,
he
could
not
avoid
expressing
some
consciousness
of
the
terrible
knowledge
she
possessed
.
  
<EOS>
She
,
for
her
part
,
was
softer
and
gentler
than
she
had
even
been
in
her
gentlest
mood
;
since
her
illness
,
her
motions
,
her
glances
,
her
voice
were
all
tender
in
their
languor
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
almost
a
trouble
to
her
to
break
the
silence
with
the
low
sounds
of
her
own
sweet
voice
,
and
her
words
fell
sparingly
on
Jem
's
greedy
,
listening
ear
.
  
<EOS>
Her
face
was
,
however
,
so
full
of
love
and
confidence
,
that
Jem
felt
no
uneasiness
at
the
state
of
silent
abstraction
into
which
she
often
fell
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
did
but
love
him
,
all
would
yet
go
right
;
and
it
was
better
not
to
press
for
confidence
on
that
one
subject
which
must
be
painful
to
both
.
  
<EOS>
There
came
a
fine
,
bright
,
balmy
day
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mary
tottered
once
more
out
into
the
open
air
,
leaning
on
Jem
's
arm
,
and
close
to
his
beating
heart
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Sturgis
watched
them
from
her
door
,
with
a
blessing
on
her
lips
,
as
they
went
slowly
up
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
They
came
in
sight
of
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
shuddered
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
Jem
!
<EOS>
take
me
home
.
 
<EOS>
Yon
river
seems
all
made
of
glittering
,
heaving
,
dazzling
metal
,
just
as
it
did
when
I
began
to
be
ill
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
led
her
homewards
.
 
<EOS>
She
dropped
her
head
as
searching
for
something
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jem
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
all
attention
.
 
<EOS>
She
paused
for
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
may
I
go
home
?
 
<EOS>
To
Manchester
<EOS>
,
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
weary
of
this
place
;
and
I
would
fain
be
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
spoke
in
a
feeble
voice
;
not
at
all
impatiently
,
as
the
words
themselves
would
seem
to
intimate
,
but
in
a
mournful
way
,
as
if
anticipating
sorrow
even
in
the
very
fulfilment
of
her
wishes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Darling
!
<EOS>
we
will
go
whenever
you
wish
;
whenever
you
feel
strong
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
Job
to
tell
Margaret
to
get
all
in
readiness
for
you
to
go
there
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
She
'll
tend
you
and
nurse
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
go
home
.
 
<EOS>
Job
proffered
for
you
to
go
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
but
I
must
go
home
,
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
try
and
not
fail
now
in
what
's
right
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
things
we
must
not
speak
on
"
(
lowering
her
voice
)
,
"
but
you
'll
be
really
kind
if
you
'll
not
speak
against
my
going
home
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
say
no
more
about
it
,
dear
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
go
home
,
and
I
must
go
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
alone
,
Mary
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
alone
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
you
why
I
ask
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
you
guess
,
I
know
you
well
enough
to
be
sure
you
'll
understand
why
I
ask
you
never
to
speak
on
that
again
to
me
,
till
I
begin
.
 
<EOS>
Promise
,
dear
Jem
,
promise
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
promised
;
to
gratify
that
beseeching
face
,
he
promised
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
he
repented
,
and
felt
as
if
he
had
done
ill
.
 
<EOS>
Then
again
he
felt
as
if
she
were
the
best
judge
,
and
knowing
all
(
perhaps
more
than
even
he
did
)
,
might
be
forming
plans
which
his
interference
would
mar
.
  
<EOS>
One
thing
was
certain
!
<EOS>
it
was
a
miserable
thing
to
have
this
awful
forbidden
ground
of
discourse
;
to
guess
at
each
other
's
thoughts
,
when
eyes
were
averted
,
and
cheeks
blanched
,
and
words
stood
still
,
arrested
in
their
flow
by
some
casual
allusion
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
a
day
,
fine
enough
for
Mary
to
travel
on
,
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
wished
to
go
,
but
now
her
courage
failed
her
.
 
<EOS>
How
could
she
have
said
she
was
weary
of
that
quiet
house
,
where
even
Ben
Sturgis
's
grumblings
only
made
a
kind
of
harmonious
bass
in
the
concord
between
him
and
his
wife
,
so
thoroughly
did
they
know
each
other
with
the
knowledge
of
many
years
!
 
<EOS>
How
could
she
have
longed
to
quit
that
little
peaceful
room
where
she
had
experienced
such
loving
tendence
!
 
<EOS>
Even
the
very
check
bed
-
curtains
became
dear
to
her
under
the
idea
of
seeing
them
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
was
so
with
inanimate
objects
,
if
they
had
such
power
of
exciting
regret
,
what
were
her
feelings
with
regard
to
the
kind
old
couple
,
who
had
taken
the
stranger
in
,
and
cared
for
her
,
and
nursed
her
,
as
though
she
had
been
a
daughter
?
 
<EOS>
Each
wilful
sentence
spoken
in
the
half
-
unconscious
irritation
of
feebleness
came
now
with
avenging
self
-
reproach
to
her
memory
,
as
she
hung
about
Mrs.
Sturgis
,
with
many
tears
,
which
served
instead
of
words
to
express
her
gratitude
and
love
.
  
<EOS>
Ben
bustled
about
with
the
square
bottle
of
Goldenwasser
in
one
of
his
hands
,
and
a
small
tumbler
in
the
other
;
he
went
to
Mary
,
Jem
,
and
his
wife
in
succession
,
pouring
out
a
glass
for
each
,
and
bidding
them
drink
it
to
keep
their
spirits
up
;
but
as
each
severally
refused
,
he
drank
it
himself
;
and
passed
on
to
offer
the
same
hospitality
to
another
,
with
the
like
refusal
,
and
the
like
result
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
swallowed
the
last
of
the
three
draughts
,
he
condescended
to
give
his
reasons
for
having
done
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
abide
waste
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
poured
out
mun
be
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
my
maxim
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
replaced
the
bottle
in
the
cupboard
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
he
who
,
in
a
firm
commanding
voice
,
at
last
told
Jem
and
Mary
to
be
off
,
or
they
would
be
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sturgis
had
kept
up
till
then
;
but
as
they
left
her
house
,
she
could
no
longer
restrain
her
tears
,
and
cried
aloud
in
spite
of
her
husband
's
upbraiding
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
they
'll
be
too
late
for
the
train
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
she
,
with
a
degree
of
hope
,
as
the
clock
struck
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
and
come
back
again
!
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
that
would
never
do
.
 
<EOS>
We
've
done
our
part
,
and
cried
our
cry
;
it
's
no
use
going
over
the
same
ground
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
ha
'
to
give
'em
more
out
of
yon
bottle
when
next
parting
time
came
,
and
them
three
glasses
they
ha
'
made
a
hole
in
the
stuff
,
I
can
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
Time
Jack
was
back
from
Hamburg
with
some
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
they
reached
Manchester
,
Mary
looked
very
white
,
and
the
expression
of
her
face
was
almost
stern
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
in
fact
summoning
up
her
resolution
to
meet
her
father
if
he
were
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
had
never
named
his
midnight
glimpse
of
John
Barton
to
human
being
:
but
Mary
had
a
sort
of
presentiment
,
that
wander
where
he
would
,
he
would
seek
his
home
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
what
mood
she
dreaded
to
think
.
<EOS>
For
the
knowledge
of
her
father
's
capability
of
guilt
seemed
to
have
opened
a
dark
gulf
in
his
character
,
into
the
depths
of
which
she
trembled
to
look
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
moment
she
would
fain
have
claimed
protection
against
the
life
she
must
lead
,
for
some
time
at
least
,
alone
with
a
murderer
!
 
<EOS>
She
thought
of
his
gloom
,
before
his
mind
was
haunted
by
the
memory
of
so
terrible
a
crime
;
his
moody
,
irritable
ways
.
 
<EOS>
She
imagined
the
evenings
as
of
old
;
she
,
toiling
at
some
work
,
long
after
houses
were
shut
,
and
folks
abed
;
<EOS>
he
,
more
savage
than
he
had
ever
been
before
with
the
inward
gnawing
of
his
remorse
.
 
<EOS>
At
such
times
she
could
have
cried
aloud
with
terror
,
at
the
scenes
her
fancy
conjured
up
.
  
<EOS>
But
her
filial
duty
,
nay
,
her
love
and
gratitude
for
many
deeds
of
kindness
done
to
her
as
a
little
child
,
conquered
all
fear
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
endure
all
imaginable
terrors
,
although
of
daily
occurrence
.
<EOS>
And
she
would
patiently
bear
all
wayward
violence
of
temper
;
more
than
patiently
would
she
bear
it
 
pitifully
,
as
one
who
knew
of
some
awful
curse
awaiting
the
blood
-
shedder
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
watch
over
him
tenderly
,
as
the
innocent
should
watch
over
the
guilty
;
awaiting
the
gracious
seasons
,
wherein
to
pour
oil
and
balm
into
the
bitter
wounds
.
  
<EOS>
With
the
untroubled
peace
which
the
resolve
to
endure
to
the
end
gives
,
she
approached
the
house
that
from
habit
she
still
called
home
,
but
which
possessed
the
holiness
of
home
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jem
!
"
said
she
,
as
they
stood
at
the
entrance
to
the
court
,
close
by
Job
Legh
's
door
,
"
you
must
go
in
there
and
wait
half
-
an
-
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Not
less
.
<EOS>
If
in
that
time
I
do
n't
come
back
,
you
go
your
ways
to
your
mother
.
<EOS>
Give
her
my
dear
love
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
send
by
Margaret
when
I
want
to
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
sighed
heavily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
!
<EOS>
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
leave
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
speak
as
coldly
as
if
we
were
to
be
nought
to
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
heart
's
bound
up
in
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
why
you
bid
me
keep
away
,
but
"
    
She
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
,
as
he
spoke
in
a
loud
agitated
tone
;
she
looked
into
his
face
with
upbraiding
love
in
her
eyes
,
and
then
she
said
,
while
her
lips
quivered
,
and
he
felt
her
whole
frame
trembling
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Jem
!
 
<EOS>
I
often
could
have
told
you
more
of
love
,
if
I
had
not
once
spoken
out
so
free
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
that
time
,
Jem
,
if
ever
you
think
me
cold
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
love
that
's
in
my
heart
would
out
in
words
;
but
now
,
though
I
'm
silent
on
the
pain
I
'm
feeling
in
quitting
you
,
the
love
is
in
my
heart
all
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
is
not
the
time
to
speak
on
such
things
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
do
not
do
what
I
feel
to
be
right
now
,
I
may
blame
myself
all
my
life
long
!
 
<EOS>
Jem
,
you
promised
"
    
<EOS>
And
so
saying
she
left
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
went
quicker
than
she
would
otherwise
have
passed
over
those
few
yards
of
ground
,
<EOS>
for
fear
he
should
still
try
to
accompany
her
.
 
<EOS>
Her
hand
was
on
the
latch
,
and
in
a
breath
the
door
was
opened
.
  
<EOS>
There
sat
her
father
,
still
and
motionless
 
not
even
turning
his
head
to
see
who
had
entered
;
but
perhaps
he
recognised
the
footstep
 
the
trick
of
action
.
  
<EOS>
He
sat
by
the
fire
;
the
grate
,
I
should
say
,
for
fire
there
was
none
.
 
<EOS>
Some
dull
grey
ashes
,
negligently
left
,
long
days
ago
,
coldly
choked
up
the
bars
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
taken
the
accustomed
seat
from
mere
force
of
habit
,
which
ruled
his
automaton
body
.
 
<EOS>
For
all
energy
,
both
physical
and
mental
,
seemed
to
have
retreated
inwards
to
some
of
the
great
citadels
of
life
,
there
to
do
battle
against
the
Destroyer
,
Conscience
.
  
<EOS>
His
hands
were
crossed
,
his
fingers
interlaced
;
usually
a
position
implying
some
degree
of
resolution
,
or
strength
;
but
in
him
it
was
so
faintly
maintained
,
that
it
appeared
more
the
result
of
chance
;
<EOS>
an
attitude
requiring
some
application
of
outward
force
to
alter
 
and
a
blow
with
a
straw
seemed
as
though
it
would
be
sufficient
.
  
<EOS>
And
as
for
his
face
,
it
was
sunk
and
worn
 
like
a
skull
,
with
yet
a
suffering
expression
that
skulls
have
not
!
 
<EOS>
Your
heart
would
have
ached
to
have
seen
the
man
,
however
hardly
you
might
have
judged
his
crime
.
  
<EOS>
But
crime
and
all
was
forgotten
by
his
daughter
,
as
she
saw
his
abashed
look
,
his
smitten
helplessness
.
 
<EOS>
All
along
she
had
felt
it
difficult
(
as
I
may
have
said
before
)
to
reconcile
the
two
ideas
,
of
her
father
and
a
blood
-
shedder
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
it
was
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
her
father
!
<EOS>
her
own
dear
father
!
<EOS>
and
in
his
sufferings
,
whatever
their
cause
,
more
dearly
loved
than
ever
before
.
 
<EOS>
His
crime
was
a
thing
apart
,
never
more
to
be
considered
by
her
.
  
<EOS>
And
tenderly
did
she
treat
him
,
and
fondly
did
she
serve
him
in
every
way
that
heart
could
devise
,
or
hand
execute
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
some
money
about
her
,
the
price
of
her
strange
services
as
a
witness
;
and
when
the
lingering
dusk
grew
on
she
stole
out
to
effect
some
purchases
necessary
for
her
father
's
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
For
how
body
and
soul
had
been
kept
together
,
even
as
much
as
they
were
,
during
the
days
he
had
dwelt
alone
,
no
one
can
say
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
was
bare
as
when
Mary
had
left
it
,
of
coal
,
or
of
candle
,
of
food
,
or
of
blessing
in
any
shape
.
  
<EOS>
She
came
quickly
home
;
but
as
she
passed
Job
Legh
's
door
,
she
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
Doubtless
Jem
had
long
since
gone
;
and
doubtless
,
<EOS>
too
,
he
had
given
Margaret
some
good
reason
for
not
intruding
upon
her
friend
for
this
night
at
least
,
otherwise
Mary
would
have
seen
her
before
now
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
-
morrow
,
 
would
she
not
come
in
to
-
morrow
?
 
<EOS>
And
who
so
quick
as
blind
Margaret
in
noticing
tones
,
and
sighs
,
and
even
silence
?
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
give
herself
time
for
further
thought
,
her
desire
to
be
once
more
with
her
father
was
too
pressing
;
but
she
opened
the
door
,
before
she
well
knew
what
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
Mary
Barton
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
her
by
her
breathing
!
 
<EOS>
Grandfather
,
it
's
Mary
Barton
!
"
  
<EOS>
Margaret
's
joy
at
meeting
her
,
the
open
demonstration
of
her
love
,
affected
Mary
much
;
she
could
not
keep
from
crying
,
and
sat
down
weak
and
agitated
on
the
first
chair
she
could
find
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
Mary
!
<EOS>
thou'rt
<EOS>
looking
a
bit
different
to
when
I
saw
thee
last
.
 
<EOS>
Thou'lt
give
Jem
and
me
good
characters
for
sick
nurses
,
I
trust
.
 
<EOS>
If
all
trades
fail
,
I
'll
turn
to
that
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
's
place
is
for
life
,
I
reckon
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
never
redden
so
,
lass
.
 
<EOS>
You
and
<EOS>
he
know
each
other
's
minds
by
this
time
!
"
  
<EOS>
Margaret
held
her
hand
,
and
gently
smiled
into
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
Job
Legh
took
the
candle
up
,
and
began
a
leisurely
inspection
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
hast
gotten
a
bit
of
pink
in
thy
cheeks
,
 
not
much
;
but
when
last
I
see
thee
,
thy
lips
were
as
white
as
a
sheet
.
 
<EOS>
Thy
nose
is
sharpish
at
th
'
end
;
thou'rt
more
like
thy
father
than
ever
thou
wert
before
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
child
,
what
's
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
Art
thou
going
to
faint
?
"
  
<EOS>
For
Mary
had
sickened
at
the
mention
of
that
name
;
yet
she
felt
that
now
or
never
was
the
time
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
's
come
home
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
but
he
's
very
poorly
;
I
never
saw
him
as
he
is
now
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
Jem
not
to
come
near
him
for
fear
it
might
fidget
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
spoke
hastily
,
and
(
to
her
own
idea
)
in
an
unnatural
manner
.
<EOS>
But
they
did
not
seem
to
notice
it
,
nor
to
take
the
hint
she
had
thrown
out
of
company
being
unacceptable
;
for
Job
Legh
directly
put
down
some
insect
,
which
he
was
impaling
on
a
corking
-
pin
,
and
exclaimed
   
"
Thy
father
come
home
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Jem
never
said
a
word
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
And
ailing
too
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
in
,
and
cheer
him
with
a
bit
of
talk
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
knew
any
good
come
of
delegating
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
O
Job
!
<EOS>
father
can
not
stand
 
father
is
too
ill
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
come
;
not
but
that
you
're
very
kind
and
good
;
but
to
-
night
 
indeed
,
"
said
she
at
last
,
in
despair
,
seeing
Job
still
persevere
in
putting
away
his
things
;
"
you
must
not
come
till
I
send
or
come
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
Father
's
in
that
strange
way
,
I
ca
n't
answer
for
it
if
he
sees
strangers
.
<EOS>
Please
do
n't
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
come
and
tell
you
every
day
how
he
goes
on
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
off
now
to
see
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Job
!
<EOS>
kind
Job
!
<EOS>
do
n't
be
angry
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
knew
all
,
you
'd
pity
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
Job
was
muttering
away
in
high
dudgeon
,
and
even
Margaret
's
tone
was
altered
as
she
wished
Mary
good
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Just
then
she
could
ill
brook
coldness
from
any
one
,
and
least
of
all
bear
the
idea
of
being
considered
ungrateful
by
so
kind
and
zealous
<EOS>
a
friend
as
Job
had
been
<EOS>
;
so
she
turned
round
suddenly
,
even
when
her
hand
was
on
the
latch
of
the
door
,
and
ran
back
,
and
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
,
and
kissed
him
first
,
and
then
Margaret
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
the
tears
fast
falling
down
her
cheeks
,
but
no
word
spoken
,
she
hastily
left
the
house
,
and
went
back
to
her
home
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
change
in
her
father
's
position
,
or
in
his
spectral
look
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
answered
her
questions
(
but
few
in
number
,
for
so
many
subjects
were
unapproachable
)
by
monosyllables
,
and
in
a
weak
,
high
,
childish
voice
;
but
he
had
not
lifted
his
eyes
;
he
could
not
meet
his
daughter
's
look
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
,
when
she
spoke
,
or
as
she
moved
about
,
avoided
letting
her
eyes
rest
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
wished
to
be
her
usual
self
;
but
while
everything
was
done
with
a
consciousness
of
purpose
,
she
felt
it
was
impossible
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
manner
things
went
on
for
some
days
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
he
feebly
clambered
upstairs
to
bed
;
and
during
those
long
dark
hours
Mary
heard
those
groans
of
agony
which
never
escaped
his
lips
by
day
,
when
they
were
compressed
in
silence
over
his
inward
woe
.
  
<EOS>
Many
a
time
she
sat
up
listening
,
and
wondering
if
it
would
ease
his
miserable
heart
if
she
went
to
him
,
and
told
him
she
knew
all
,
and
loved
and
pitied
him
more
than
words
could
tell
.
  
<EOS>
By
day
the
monotonous
hours
wore
on
in
the
same
heavy
,
hushed
manner
as
on
that
first
dreary
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
He
ate
,
 
but
without
that
relish
;
and
food
seemed
no
longer
to
nourish
him
,
for
each
morning
his
face
had
caught
more
of
the
ghastly
foreshadowing
of
Death
.
  
<EOS>
The
neighbours
kept
strangely
aloof
.
 
<EOS>
Of
late
years
John
Barton
had
had
a
repellent
power
about
him
,
felt
by
all
,
except
to
the
few
who
had
either
known
him
in
his
better
and
happier
days
,
or
those
to
whom
he
had
given
his
sympathy
and
his
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
People
did
not
care
to
enter
the
doors
of
one
whose
very
depth
of
thoughtfulness
rendered
him
moody
and
stern
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
they
contented
themselves
with
a
kind
inquiry
when
they
saw
Mary
in
her
goings
-
out
or
in
her
comings
-
in
.
 
<EOS>
With
her
oppressing
knowledge
,
she
imagined
their
reserved
conduct
stranger
than
it
was
in
reality
.
 
<EOS>
She
missed
Job
and
Margaret
too
;
<EOS>
who
,
in
all
former
times
of
sorrow
or
anxiety
since
their
acquaintance
first
began
,
had
been
ready
with
their
sympathy
.
  
<EOS>
But
most
of
all
she
missed
the
delicious
luxury
she
had
lately
enjoyed
in
having
Jem
's
tender
love
at
hand
every
hour
of
the
day
,
to
ward
off
every
wind
of
heaven
,
and
every
disturbing
thought
.
  
<EOS>
She
knew
he
was
often
hovering
about
the
house
;
though
the
knowledge
seemed
to
come
more
by
intuition
,
than
by
any
positive
sight
or
sound
for
the
first
day
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
third
day
she
met
him
at
Job
Legh
's
.
  
<EOS>
They
received
her
with
every
effort
of
cordiality
;
but
still
there
was
a
cobweb
-
veil
of
separation
between
them
,
to
which
Mary
was
morbidly
acute
;
while
in
Jem
's
voice
,
and
eyes
,
and
manner
,
there
was
every
evidence
of
most
passionate
,
most
admiring
,
and
most
trusting
love
.
 
<EOS>
The
trust
was
shown
by
his
respectful
silence
on
that
one
point
of
reserve
on
which
she
had
interdicted
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
He
left
Job
Legh
's
house
when
she
did
.
 
<EOS>
They
lingered
on
the
step
,
he
holding
her
hand
between
both
of
his
,
as
loth
to
let
her
go
;
he
questioned
her
as
to
when
he
should
see
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
does
so
want
to
see
you
,
"
whispered
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
come
to
see
her
to
-
morrow
;
or
when
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
,
"
replied
she
softly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Wait
awhile
;
<EOS>
perhaps
only
a
little
while
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Jem
,
I
must
go
to
him
,
 
dearest
Jem
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
,
the
fourth
from
Mary
's
return
home
,
as
she
was
sitting
near
the
window
,
sadly
dreaming
over
some
work
,
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
last
person
she
wished
to
see
 
of
Sally
Leadbitter
!
  
<EOS>
She
was
evidently
coming
to
their
house
;
another
moment
,
and
she
tapped
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
John
Barton
gave
an
anxious
,
uneasy
side
-
glance
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
knew
that
if
she
delayed
answering
the
knock
,
Sally
would
not
scruple
to
enter
;
so
as
hastily
as
if
the
visit
had
been
desired
,
she
opened
the
door
,
and
stood
there
with
the
latch
in
her
hand
,
barring
up
all
entrance
,
and
as
much
as
possible
obstructing
all
curious
glances
into
the
interior
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mary
Barton
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
home
at
last
!
 
<EOS>
I
heard
you
'd
getten
home
;
so
I
thought
I
'd
just
step
over
and
hear
the
news
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
bent
on
coming
in
,
and
saw
Mary
's
preventive
design
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
stood
on
tiptoe
,
looking
over
Mary
's
shoulders
into
the
room
where
she
suspected
a
lover
to
be
lurking
;
but
instead
,
she
saw
only
the
figure
of
the
stern
,
gloomy
father
<EOS>
she
had
always
been
in
the
habit
of
avoiding
;
and
she
dropped
down
again
,
content
to
carry
on
the
conversation
where
Mary
chose
,
and
as
Mary
chose
,
in
whispers
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
the
old
governor
is
back
again
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
And
what
does
he
say
to
all
your
fine
doings
at
Liverpool
,
and
before
?
 
<EOS>
you
and
<EOS>
I
know
where
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
hide
it
now
,
Mary
,
for
it
's
all
in
print
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
gave
a
low
moan
 
and
then
implored
Sally
to
change
the
subject
;
for
unpleasant
as
it
always
was
,
it
was
doubly
unpleasant
in
the
manner
in
which
she
was
treating
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
had
been
alone
<EOS>
Mary
would
have
borne
it
patiently
 
<EOS>
or
she
thought
,
<EOS>
but
now
she
felt
almost
certain
,
her
father
was
listening
;
there
was
a
subdued
breathing
,
a
slight
bracing
-
up
of
the
listless
attitude
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
arresting
Sally
's
curiosity
to
hear
all
she
could
respecting
the
adventures
Mary
had
experienced
.
 
<EOS>
She
,
in
common
with
the
rest
of
Miss
Simmonds
'
young
ladies
,
was
almost
jealous
of
the
fame
that
Mary
had
obtained
;
to
herself
,
such
miserable
notoriety
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
!
<EOS>
there
's
no
use
shunning
talking
it
over
.
 
<EOS>
Why
!
<EOS>
it
was
in
the
Guardian
 
and
the
Courier
 
and
some
one
told
Jane
Hodgson
it
was
even
copied
into
a
London
paper
.
 
<EOS>
You
've
set
up
heroine
on
your
own
account
,
Mary
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
How
did
you
like
standing
witness
?
 
<EOS>
Are
n't
them
lawyers
impudent
things
?
<EOS>
staring
at
one
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
be
bound
<EOS>
you
wished
you
'd
taken
my
offer
,
and
borrowed
my
black
watered
scarf
!
<EOS>
Now
did
n't
you
,
Mary
?
 
<EOS>
Speak
truth
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
tell
the
truth
,
I
never
thought
about
it
then
,
Sally
.
 
<EOS>
How
could
I
?
"
asked
she
reproachfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
 
I
forgot
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
all
for
that
stupid
James
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
if
I
've
ever
the
luck
to
go
witness
on
a
trial
,
see
if
I
do
n't
pick
up
a
better
beau
than
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
aim
at
a
lawyer
's
clerk
,
but
I
'll
not
take
less
than
a
turnkey
.
"
  
<EOS>
Cast
down
as
Mary
was
,
she
could
hardly
keep
from
smiling
at
the
idea
,
so
wildly
incongruous
with
the
scene
she
had
really
undergone
,
of
looking
out
for
admirers
during
a
trial
for
murder
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
no
thought
to
be
looking
out
for
beaux
<EOS>
,
I
can
assure
you
,
Sally
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
let
us
talk
any
more
about
it
<EOS>
;
I
ca
n't
bear
to
think
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
How
is
Miss
Simmonds
?
<EOS>
and
everybody
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
very
well
;
and
by
the
way
,
she
gave
me
a
bit
of
a
message
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
come
back
to
work
if
you
'll
behave
yourself
,
she
says
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
she
'd
be
glad
to
have
you
back
,
after
all
this
piece
of
business
,
by
way
of
tempting
people
to
come
to
her
shop
.
 
<EOS>
They
'd
come
from
Salford
to
have
a
peep
at
you
,
for
six
months
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
talk
so
;
I
can
not
come
,
I
can
never
face
Miss
Simmonds
again
.
<EOS>
And
even
if
I
could
"
 
s
he
stopped
,
and
blushed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
I
know
what
you
are
thinking
on
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
will
not
be
this
some
time
,
as
he
's
turned
off
from
the
foundry
 
<EOS>
you
'd
better
think
twice
afore
refusing
Miss
Simmonds
'
offer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Turned
off
from
the
foundry
?
 
<EOS>
Jem
?
"
cried
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
!
<EOS>
did
n't
you
know
it
?
 
<EOS>
Decent
men
were
not
going
to
work
with
a
 
no
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
must
n't
say
it
,
seeing
you
went
to
such
trouble
to
get
up
an
alibi
;
not
that
I
should
think
much
the
worse
of
a
spirited
young
fellow
for
falling
foul
of
a
rival
 
they
always
do
at
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Mary
's
thoughts
were
with
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
How
good
he
had
been
never
to
name
his
dismissal
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
How
much
he
had
had
to
endure
for
her
sake
!
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
all
about
it
,
"
she
gasped
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
see
,
they
've
always
swords
quite
handy
at
them
plays
,
"
began
Sally
;
but
Mary
,
with
an
impatient
shake
of
her
head
,
interrupted
   
"
About
Jem
 
about
Jem
<EOS>
,
I
want
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
do
n't
pretend
to
know
more
than
is
in
every
one
's
mouth
:
he
's
turned
away
from
the
foundry
,
because
folk
does
n't
think
you
've
cleared
him
outright
of
the
murder
;
though
perhaps
the
jury
were
loth
to
hang
him
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Mr.
Carson
is
savage
against
judge
and
jury
,
and
lawyers
and
all
,
as
I
heard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
to
him
,
I
must
go
to
him
,
"
repeated
Mary
,
in
a
hurried
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
tell
you
all
I
've
said
is
true
,
and
not
a
word
of
lie
,
"
replied
Sally
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
'll
not
give
your
answer
to
Miss
Simmonds
,
but
leave
you
to
think
twice
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Good
afternoon
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
shut
the
door
,
and
turned
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
sat
in
the
same
attitude
;
the
old
unchanging
attitude
.
<EOS>
Only
his
head
was
more
bowed
towards
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
She
put
on
her
bonnet
to
go
to
Ancoats
;
for
see
,
and
question
,
and
comfort
,
and
worship
Jem
,
she
must
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
hung
about
her
father
for
an
instant
before
leaving
him
,
he
spoke
 
voluntarily
spoke
for
the
first
time
since
her
return
;
but
his
head
was
drooping
so
low
she
could
not
hear
what
he
said
,
so
she
stooped
down
;
and
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
he
repeated
the
words
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
Jem
Wilson
to
come
here
at
eight
o'clock
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Could
he
have
overheard
her
conversation
with
Sally
Leadbitter
?
<EOS>
They
had
whispered
low
,
she
thought
.
 
<EOS>
Pondering
on
this
,
and
many
other
things
,
she
reached
Ancoats
.
   
<EOS>
"
FORGIVE
US
OUR
TRESPASSES
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
had
he
lived
,
Replied
Rusilla
,
never
penitence
Had
equalled
his
!
<EOS>
full
<EOS>
well
I
knew
his
heart
,
Vehement
in
all
things
.
<EOS>
He
would
on
himself
Have
wreaked
such
penance
as
had
reached
the
height
Of
fleshy
suffering
,
 
yea
,
which
being
told
,
With
its
portentous
rigour
should
have
made
The
memory
of
his
fault
o'erpowered
and
lost
,
In
shuddering
pity
and
astonishment
,
Fade
like
a
feeble
horror
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
SOUTHEY
'S
Roderick
.
  
<EOS>
As
Mary
was
turning
into
the
street
where
the
Wilsons
lived
,
Jem
overtook
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
upon
her
suddenly
,
and
she
started
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
going
to
see
mother
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
tenderly
,
placing
her
arm
within
his
,
and
slackening
his
pace
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
you
too
.
 
<EOS>
O
Jem
,
is
it
true
?
<EOS>
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
felt
rightly
that
he
would
guess
the
meaning
of
her
only
half
-
expressed
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
He
hesitated
a
moment
before
he
answered
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Darling
,
it
is
;
it
's
no
use
hiding
it
 
if
you
mean
that
I
'm
no
longer
to
work
at
Duncombe
's
foundry
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
no
time
(
to
my
mind
)
to
have
secrets
from
each
other
,
though
I
did
not
name
it
yesterday
,
thinking
you
might
fret
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
soon
get
work
again
,
never
fear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
did
they
turn
you
off
,
when
the
jury
had
said
you
were
innocent
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
just
to
say
turned
off
,
though
I
do
n't
think
I
could
have
well
stayed
on
.
 
<EOS>
A
good
number
of
the
men
managed
to
let
out
they
should
not
like
to
work
under
me
again
;
there
were
some
few
who
knew
me
well
enough
to
feel
I
could
not
have
done
it
,
but
more
were
doubtful
;
and
one
spoke
to
young
Mr.
Duncombe
,
hinting
at
what
they
thought
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
O
Jem
!
<EOS>
what
a
shame
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mary
,
with
mournful
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
darling
!
<EOS>
I
'm
not
for
blaming
them
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
fellows
like
them
have
nought
to
stand
upon
and
be
proud
of
but
their
character
,
and
it
's
fitting
they
should
take
care
of
that
,
and
keep
that
free
from
soil
and
taint
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
 
what
could
they
get
but
good
from
you
?
 
<EOS>
They
might
have
known
you
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
some
do
;
the
overlooker
,
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
,
would
know
I
'm
innocent
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
said
as
much
to
-
day
;
and
he
said
he
had
had
some
talk
with
old
Mr.
Duncombe
,
and
they
thought
it
might
be
better
if
I
left
Manchester
for
a
bit
;
they
'd
recommend
me
to
some
other
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Mary
could
only
shake
her
head
in
a
mournful
way
,
and
repeat
her
words
   
<EOS>
"
They
might
have
known
thee
better
,
Jem
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
pressed
the
little
hand
he
held
between
his
own
work
-
hardened
ones
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
minute
or
two
,
he
asked
   
"
Mary
,
art
thou
much
bound
to
Manchester
?
 
<EOS>
Would
it
grieve
thee
sore
to
quit
the
old
smoke
-
jack
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
With
thee
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
in
a
quiet
,
glancing
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
lass
!
 
<EOS>
Trust
me
,
I
'll
never
ask
thee
to
leave
Manchester
while
I
'm
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Because
I
have
heard
fine
things
of
Canada
;
and
our
overlooker
has
a
cousin
in
the
foundry
line
there
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
knowest
where
Canada
is
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
rightly
 
not
now
,
at
any
rate
<EOS>
;
 
but
with
thee
,
Jem
,
"
her
voice
sunk
to
a
soft
,
low
whisper
,
"
anywhere
"
    
What
was
the
use
of
a
geographical
description
?
  
<EOS>
"
But
father
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mary
,
suddenly
breaking
that
delicious
silence
with
the
one
sharp
discord
in
her
present
life
.
  
<EOS>
She
looked
up
at
her
lover
's
grave
face
;
and
then
the
message
her
father
had
sent
flashed
across
her
memory
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
Jem
,
did
I
tell
you
?
 
<EOS>
Father
sent
word
he
wished
to
speak
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
bid
you
<EOS>
come
to
him
at
eight
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
he
want
,
Jem
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
,
"
replied
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
I
'll
go
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
no
use
troubling
ourselves
to
guess
,
"
he
continued
,
after
a
pause
for
a
few
minutes
,
during
which
they
slowly
and
silently
paced
up
and
down
the
by
-
street
,
into
which
he
had
led
her
when
their
conversation
began
.
<EOS>
"
Come
and
see
mother
,
and
then
I
'll
take
thee
home
,
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
wert
all
in
a
tremble
<EOS>
when
first
I
came
up
to
thee
;
thou'rt
not
fit
to
be
trusted
home
by
thyself
,
"
said
he
,
with
fond
exaggeration
of
her
helplessness
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
a
little
more
lovers
'
loitering
!
<EOS>
a
few
more
words
,
in
themselves
nothing
 
to
you
nothing
 
but
to
those
two
,
what
tender
passionate
language
can
I
use
to
express
the
feelings
which
thrilled
through
that
young
man
and
maiden
,
as
they
listened
to
the
syllables
made
dear
and
lovely
through
life
by
that
hour
's
low
-
whispered
talk
.
  
<EOS>
It
struck
the
half
-
hour
past
seven
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
and
speak
to
mother
<EOS>
;
she
knows
you
're
to
be
her
daughter
,
Mary
,
darling
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
they
went
in
.
 
<EOS>
Jane
Wilson
was
rather
chafed
at
her
son
's
delay
in
returning
home
,
for
as
yet
he
had
managed
to
keep
her
in
ignorance
of
his
dismissal
from
the
foundry
;
and
it
was
her
way
to
prepare
some
little
pleasure
,
some
little
comfort
for
those
she
loved
;
and
if
they
,
unwittingly
,
did
not
appear
at
the
proper
time
to
enjoy
her
preparation
,
she
worked
herself
up
into
a
state
of
fretfulness
which
found
vent
in
upbraidings
as
soon
as
ever
the
objects
of
her
care
appeared
,
thereby
marring
the
peace
which
should
ever
be
the
atmosphere
of
a
home
,
however
humble
;
and
causing
a
feeling
almost
amounting
to
loathing
to
arise
at
the
sight
of
the
"
stalled
ox
,
"
which
,
though
an
effect
and
proof
of
careful
love
,
has
been
the
cause
of
so
much
disturbance
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilson
at
first
sighed
,
and
then
grumbled
to
herself
,
over
the
increasing
toughness
of
the
potato
-
cakes
she
had
made
for
her
son
's
tea
.
  
<EOS>
The
door
opened
,
and
he
came
in
;
his
face
brightening
into
proud
smiles
,
Mary
Barton
hanging
on
his
arm
,
blushing
and
dimpling
,
with
eyelids
veiling
the
happy
light
of
her
eyes
 
<EOS>
there
was
around
the
young
couple
a
radiant
atmosphere
 
a
glory
of
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
Could
his
mother
mar
it
?
 
<EOS>
Could
she
break
into
it
with
her
Martha
-
like
cares
?
 
<EOS>
Only
for
one
moment
did
she
remember
her
sense
of
injury
,
 
her
wasted
trouble
,
 
and
then
her
whole
woman
's
heart
heaving
with
motherly
love
and
sympathy
,
she
opened
her
arms
,
and
received
Mary
into
them
,
as
shedding
tears
of
agitated
joy
,
she
murmured
in
her
ear
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
thee
,
Mary
,
bless
thee
!
 
<EOS>
Only
make
him
happy
,
and
God
bless
thee
for
ever
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
took
some
of
Jem
's
self
-
command
to
separate
those
whom
he
so
much
loved
,
and
who
were
beginning
,
for
his
sake
,
to
love
one
another
so
dearly
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
time
for
his
meeting
John
Barton
drew
on
:
and
it
was
a
long
way
to
his
house
.
  
<EOS>
As
they
walked
briskly
thither
they
hardly
spoke
;
though
many
thoughts
were
in
their
minds
.
  
<EOS>
The
sun
had
not
long
set
,
but
the
first
faint
shade
of
twilight
was
over
all
;
and
when
they
opened
the
door
,
Jem
could
hardly
perceive
the
objects
within
by
the
waning
light
of
day
,
and
the
flickering
fire
-
blaze
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mary
saw
all
at
a
glance
.
  
<EOS>
Her
eye
,
accustomed
to
what
was
usual
in
the
aspect
of
the
room
,
saw
instantly
what
was
unusual
,
 
saw
and
understood
it
all
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
was
standing
behind
his
habitual
chair
;
holding
by
the
back
of
it
as
if
for
support
.
 
<EOS>
And
opposite
to
him
there
stood
Mr.
Carson
;
the
dark
outline
of
his
stern
figure
looming
large
against
the
light
of
the
fire
in
that
little
room
.
  
<EOS>
Behind
her
father
sat
Job
Legh
,
his
head
in
his
hands
,
and
resting
his
elbow
on
the
little
family
table
,
listening
evidently
;
but
as
evidently
deeply
affected
by
what
he
heard
.
  
<EOS>
There
seemed
to
be
some
pause
in
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
and
Jem
stood
at
the
half
-
open
door
,
not
daring
to
stir
;
hardly
to
breathe
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
have
I
heard
you
aright
?
"
began
Mr.
Carson
,
with
his
deep
quivering
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Man
!
<EOS>
have
I
heard
you
aright
?
 
<EOS>
Was
it
you
,
then
,
that
killed
my
boy
?
<EOS>
my
only
son
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
he
said
these
last
few
words
almost
as
if
appealing
for
pity
,
and
then
he
changed
his
tone
to
one
more
vehement
and
fierce
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
dare
to
think
that
I
shall
be
merciful
,
and
spare
you
,
because
you
have
come
forward
to
accuse
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
I
will
not
spare
you
<EOS>
the
least
pang
the
law
can
inflict
,
 
<EOS>
you
,
who
did
not
show
pity
on
my
boy
,
shall
have
none
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
ask
for
any
,
"
said
John
Barton
,
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
,
or
not
ask
,
what
care
I
?
 
<EOS>
You
shall
be
hanged
 
hanged
 
man
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
advancing
his
face
,
and
repeating
the
word
with
slow
,
grinding
emphasis
,
as
if
to
infuse
some
of
the
bitterness
of
his
soul
into
it
.
  
<EOS>
John
Barton
gasped
,
but
not
with
fear
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
only
that
he
felt
it
terrible
to
have
inspired
such
hatred
,
as
was
concentrated
into
every
word
,
every
gesture
of
Mr.
Carson
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
for
being
hanged
,
sir
,
I
know
it
's
all
right
and
proper
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
it
's
bad
enough
;
but
I
tell
you
what
,
sir
,
"
speaking
with
an
outburst
,
"
if
you
'd
hanged
me
the
day
after
I
'd
done
the
deed
,
I
would
have
gone
down
on
my
knees
and
blessed
you
.
 
<EOS>
Death
!
 
<EOS>
Lord
,
what
is
it
to
Life
?
 
<EOS>
To
such
a
life
as
I
've
been
leading
this
fortnight
past
.
 
<EOS>
Life
at
best
is
no
great
thing
;
but
such
a
life
as
I
have
dragged
through
since
that
night
,
"
he
shuddered
at
the
thought
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
I
've
been
on
the
point
of
killing
myself
this
many
a
time
to
get
away
from
my
own
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
!
<EOS>
and
I
'll
tell
you
why
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
but
that
I
should
be
more
haunted
than
ever
with
the
recollection
of
my
sin
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
God
above
only
can
tell
the
agony
with
which
I
've
repented
me
of
it
,
and
part
perhaps
because
I
feared
He
would
think
I
were
impatient
of
the
misery
He
sent
as
punishment
 
far
,
far
worse
misery
than
any
hanging
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
ceased
from
excess
of
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
Then
he
began
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sin
'
that
day
(
it
may
be
very
wicked
,
sir
,
but
it
's
the
truth
)
<EOS>
I
've
kept
thinking
and
thinking
if
I
were
but
in
that
world
where
they
say
God
is
,
He
would
,
maybe
,
teach
me
right
from
wrong
,
even
if
it
were
with
many
stripes
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
sore
puzzled
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
go
through
hell
-
fire
if
I
could
but
get
free
from
sin
at
last
<EOS>
,
it
's
such
an
awful
thing
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
hanging
,
that
's
just
nought
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
exhaustion
compelled
him
to
sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
rushed
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
till
then
he
had
been
unaware
of
her
presence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
wench
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
feebly
,
"
is
it
thee
?
 
<EOS>
Where
's
Jem
Wilson
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
came
forward
.
  
<EOS>
John
Barton
spoke
again
,
with
many
a
break
and
gasping
pause
   
<EOS>
"
Lad
!
<EOS>
thou
hast
borne
a
deal
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
meanest
thing
I
ever
did
to
leave
thee
to
bear
the
brunt
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
,
who
wert
as
innocent
of
any
knowledge
of
it
as
the
babe
unborn
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
not
bless
thee
for
it
.
<EOS>
Blessing
from
such
as
me
would
not
bring
thee
any
good
.
 
<EOS>
Thou'lt
love
Mary
,
though
she
is
my
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
ceased
,
and
there
was
a
pause
for
a
few
seconds
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Carson
turned
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
When
his
hand
was
on
the
latch
of
the
door
,
he
hesitated
for
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
have
no
doubt
for
what
purpose
I
go
.
 
<EOS>
Straight
to
the
police
-
office
,
to
send
men
to
take
care
of
you
,
wretched
man
,
and
your
accomplice
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
morning
your
tale
shall
be
repeated
to
those
who
can
commit
you
to
gaol
,
and
before
long
you
shall
have
the
opportunity
of
trying
how
desirable
hanging
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
sir
!
"
said
Mary
,
springing
forward
,
and
catching
hold
of
Mr.
Carson
's
arm
,
"
my
father
is
dying
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
him
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
want
Death
for
Death
you
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
take
him
away
from
me
these
last
hours
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
go
alone
through
Death
,
but
let
me
be
with
him
as
long
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
O
sir
!
<EOS>
if
you
have
any
mercy
in
you
,
leave
him
here
to
die
.
"
  
<EOS>
John
himself
stood
up
,
stiff
and
rigid
,
and
replied
   
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
wench
!
<EOS>
I
owe
him
summit
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
die
,
where
,
and
as
he
wishes
me
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
hast
said
true
,
I
am
standing
side
by
side
with
Death
;
and
it
matters
little
where
I
spend
the
bit
of
time
left
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
That
time
I
must
pass
wrestling
with
my
soul
for
a
character
to
take
into
the
other
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
where
you
see
fit
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
innocent
,
"
faintly
indicating
Jem
,
as
he
fell
back
in
his
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
fear
!
 
<EOS>
They
can
not
touch
him
,
"
said
Job
Legh
,
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
But
as
Mr.
Carson
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
house
with
no
sign
of
relenting
about
him
,
he
was
again
stopped
by
John
Barton
,
who
had
risen
once
more
from
his
chair
,
and
stood
supporting
himself
on
Jem
,
while
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
one
word
!
 
<EOS>
My
hairs
are
grey
with
suffering
,
and
yours
with
years
"
    
"
And
have
I
had
no
suffering
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Mr.
Carson
,
as
if
appealing
for
sympathy
,
even
to
the
murderer
of
his
child
.
  
<EOS>
And
the
murderer
of
his
child
answered
to
the
appeal
,
and
groaned
in
spirit
over
the
anguish
he
had
caused
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
I
had
no
inward
suffering
to
blanch
these
hairs
?
 
<EOS>
Have
not
I
toiled
and
struggled
even
to
these
years
with
hopes
in
my
heart
that
all
centred
in
my
boy
?
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
speak
of
them
,
but
were
they
not
there
?
 
<EOS>
I
seemed
hard
and
cold
;
and
so
I
might
be
to
others
,
but
not
to
him
!
 
<EOS>
who
shall
ever
imagine
the
love
I
bore
to
him
?
 
<EOS>
Even
he
never
dreamed
how
my
heart
leapt
up
at
the
sound
of
his
footstep
,
and
how
precious
he
was
to
his
poor
old
father
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
is
gone
 
<EOS>
killed
 
out
of
the
hearing
of
all
loving
words
 
out
of
my
sight
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
my
sunshine
,
and
now
it
is
night
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
God
!
<EOS>
comfort
me
,
comfort
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
old
man
aloud
.
  
<EOS>
The
eyes
of
John
Barton
grew
dim
with
tears
.
  
<EOS>
Rich
and
poor
,
masters
and
men
,
were
then
brothers
in
the
deep
suffering
of
the
heart
;
for
was
not
this
the
very
anguish
he
had
felt
for
little
Tom
,
in
years
so
long
gone
by
,
that
they
seemed
like
another
life
!
  
<EOS>
The
mourner
before
him
was
no
longer
the
employer
;
a
being
of
another
race
,
eternally
placed
in
antagonistic
attitude
;
going
through
the
world
glittering
like
gold
,
with
a
stony
heart
within
,
which
knew
no
sorrow
but
through
the
accidents
of
Trade
;
no
longer
the
enemy
,
the
oppressor
,
but
a
very
poor
and
desolate
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
The
sympathy
for
suffering
,
formerly
so
prevalent
a
feeling
with
him
,
again
filled
John
Barton
's
heart
,
and
almost
impelled
him
to
speak
(
as
best
he
could
)
<EOS>
some
earnest
,
tender
words
to
the
stern
man
,
shaking
in
his
agony
.
  
<EOS>
But
who
was
he
,
that
he
should
utter
sympathy
or
consolation
?
 
<EOS>
The
cause
of
all
this
woe
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
blasting
thought
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
miserable
remembrance
!
 
<EOS>
He
had
forfeited
all
right
to
bind
up
his
brother
's
wounds
.
  
<EOS>
Stunned
by
the
thought
,
he
sank
upon
the
seat
,
almost
crushed
with
the
knowledge
of
the
consequences
of
his
own
action
;
for
he
had
no
more
imagined
to
himself
the
blighted
home
,
and
the
miserable
parents
,
than
does
the
soldier
,
who
discharges
his
musket
,
picture
to
himself
the
desolation
of
the
wife
,
and
the
pitiful
cries
of
the
helpless
little
ones
,
who
are
in
an
instant
to
be
made
widowed
and
fatherless
.
  
<EOS>
To
intimidate
a
class
of
men
,
known
only
to
those
below
them
as
desirous
to
obtain
the
greatest
quantity
of
work
for
the
lowest
wages
 
at
most
to
remove
an
overbearing
partner
from
an
obnoxious
firm
,
who
stood
in
the
way
of
those
who
struggled
as
well
as
they
were
able
to
obtain
their
rights
 
<EOS>
this
was
the
light
in
which
John
Barton
had
viewed
his
deed
;
and
even
so
viewing
it
,
after
the
excitement
had
passed
away
,
the
Avenger
,
the
sure
Avenger
,
had
found
him
out
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
he
knew
that
he
had
killed
a
man
,
and
a
brother
 
<EOS>
now
he
knew
that
no
good
thing
could
come
out
of
this
evil
,
even
to
the
sufferers
whose
cause
he
had
so
blindly
espoused
.
  
<EOS>
He
lay
across
the
table
,
broken
-
hearted
.
 
<EOS>
Every
fresh
quivering
sob
of
Mr.
Carson
's
stabbed
him
to
his
soul
.
  
<EOS>
He
felt
execrated
by
all
;
and
as
if
he
could
never
lay
bare
the
perverted
reasonings
which
had
made
the
performance
of
undoubted
sin
appear
a
duty
.
 
<EOS>
The
longing
to
plead
some
faint
excuse
grew
stronger
and
stronger
.
 
<EOS>
He
feebly
raised
his
head
,
and
looking
at
Job
Legh
,
he
whispered
out
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
know
what
I
was
doing
,
Job
Legh
;
God
knows
I
did
n't
!
 
<EOS>
O
sir
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
wildly
,
almost
throwing
himself
at
Mr.
Carson
's
feet
,
"
say
you
forgive
me
the
anguish
I
now
see
I
have
caused
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
care
not
for
pain
,
or
death
,
you
know
I
do
n't
;
<EOS>
but
oh
,
man
!
<EOS>
forgive
me
the
trespass
I
have
done
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Forgive
us
our
trespasses
as
we
forgive
them
that
trespass
against
us
,
"
said
Job
,
solemnly
and
low
,
as
if
in
prayer
:
as
if
the
words
were
suggested
by
those
John
Barton
had
used
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
took
his
hands
away
from
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
rather
see
death
than
the
ghastly
gloom
which
darkened
that
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
my
trespasses
be
unforgiven
,
so
that
I
may
have
vengeance
for
my
son
's
murder
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
are
blasphemous
actions
as
well
as
blasphemous
words
:
all
unloving
,
cruel
deeds
,
are
acted
blasphemy
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
left
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
And
John
Barton
lay
on
the
ground
as
one
dead
.
  
<EOS>
They
lifted
him
up
,
and
almost
hoping
that
that
deep
trance
might
be
to
him
the
end
of
all
earthly
things
,
they
bore
him
to
his
bed
.
  
<EOS>
For
a
time
they
listened
with
divided
attention
to
his
faint
breathings
;
for
in
each
hasty
hurried
step
that
echoed
in
the
street
outside
,
they
thought
they
heard
the
approach
of
the
officers
of
justice
.
  
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Carson
left
the
house
he
was
dizzy
with
agitation
;
the
hot
blood
went
careering
through
his
frame
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
see
the
deep
blue
of
the
night
-
heavens
for
the
fierce
pulses
which
throbbed
in
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
And
partly
to
steady
and
calm
himself
,
he
leaned
against
a
railing
,
and
looked
up
into
those
calm
majestic
depths
with
all
their
thousand
stars
.
  
<EOS>
And
by
-
and
-
by
his
own
voice
returned
upon
him
,
as
if
the
last
words
he
had
spoken
were
being
uttered
through
all
that
infinite
space
;
but
in
their
echoes
there
was
a
tone
of
unutterable
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
my
trespasses
be
unforgiven
,
so
that
I
may
have
vengeance
for
my
son
's
murder
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
tried
to
shake
off
the
spiritual
impression
made
by
this
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
feverish
and
ill
,
 
and
no
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
So
he
turned
to
go
homewards
;
not
,
as
he
had
threatened
,
to
the
police
-
office
.
 
<EOS>
After
all
(
he
told
himself
)
,
that
would
do
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
No
fear
of
the
man
's
escaping
,
unless
he
escaped
to
the
grave
.
  
<EOS>
So
he
tried
to
banish
the
phantom
voices
and
shapes
which
came
unbidden
to
his
brain
,
and
to
recall
his
balance
of
mind
by
walking
calmly
and
slowly
,
and
noticing
everything
which
struck
his
senses
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
warm
soft
evening
in
spring
,
and
there
were
many
persons
in
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
Among
others
a
nurse
with
a
little
girl
in
her
charge
,
conveying
her
home
from
some
children
's
gaiety
;
a
dance
most
likely
,
for
the
lovely
little
creature
was
daintily
decked
out
in
soft
,
snowy
muslin
;
and
her
fairy
feet
tripped
along
by
her
nurse
's
side
as
if
to
the
measure
of
some
tune
she
had
lately
kept
time
to
.
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
up
behind
her
there
came
a
rough
,
rude
errand
-
boy
,
nine
or
ten
years
of
age
;
a
giant
he
looked
by
the
fairy
-
child
,
as
she
fluttered
along
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
it
was
,
but
in
some
awkward
way
he
knocked
the
poor
little
girl
down
upon
the
hard
pavement
as
he
brushed
rudely
past
,
not
much
caring
whom
he
hurt
,
so
that
he
got
along
.
  
<EOS>
The
child
arose
,
sobbing
with
pain
;
and
not
without
cause
,
for
blood
was
dropping
down
from
the
face
,
but
a
minute
before
so
fair
and
bright
 
dropping
down
on
the
pretty
frock
,
making
those
scarlet
marks
so
terrible
to
little
children
.
  
<EOS>
The
nurse
,
a
powerful
woman
,
had
seized
the
boy
,
just
as
Mr.
Carson
(
who
had
seen
the
whole
transaction
)
came
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
naughty
little
rascal
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
give
you
to
a
policeman
,
that
I
will
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
see
how
you
've
hurt
the
little
girl
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
?
"
<EOS>
accompanying
every
sentence
with
a
violent
jerk
of
passionate
anger
.
  
<EOS>
The
lad
looked
hard
and
defying
;
but
withal
terrified
at
the
threat
of
the
policeman
,
those
ogres
of
our
streets
to
all
unlucky
urchins
.
<EOS>
The
nurse
saw
it
,
and
began
to
drag
him
along
,
with
a
view
of
making
what
she
called
"
a
wholesome
impression
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
terror
increased
and
with
it
his
irritation
;
when
the
little
sweet
face
,
choking
away
its
sobs
,
pulled
down
nurse
's
head
and
said
   
"
Please
,
dear
nurse
,
I
'm
not
much
hurt
;
it
was
very
silly
to
cry
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
mean
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
HE
DID
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
HE
WAS
DOING
,
did
you
,
little
boy
?
 
<EOS>
Nurse
wo
n't
call
a
policeman
,
so
do
n't
be
frightened
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
put
up
her
little
mouth
to
be
kissed
by
her
injurer
,
just
as
she
had
been
taught
to
do
at
home
to
"
make
peace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
lad
will
mind
,
and
be
more
gentle
for
the
time
to
come
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
thanks
to
that
little
lady
,
"
said
a
passer
-
by
,
half
to
himself
,
and
half
to
Mr.
Carson
,
whom
he
had
observed
to
notice
the
scene
.
  
<EOS>
The
latter
took
no
apparent
heed
of
the
remark
,
but
passed
on
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
child
's
pleading
reminded
him
of
the
low
,
broken
voice
he
had
so
lately
heard
,
penitently
and
humbly
urging
the
same
extenuation
of
his
great
guilt
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
know
what
I
was
doing
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
some
association
with
those
words
;
he
had
heard
,
or
read
of
that
plea
somewhere
before
.
 
<EOS>
Where
was
it
?
  
<EOS>
"
Could
it
be
?
"
    
<EOS>
He
would
look
when
he
got
home
.
 
<EOS>
So
when
he
entered
his
house
he
went
straight
and
silently
upstairs
to
his
library
,
and
took
down
the
great
,
large
,
handsome
Bible
,
all
grand
and
golden
,
with
its
leaves
adhering
together
from
the
bookbinder
's
press
,
so
little
had
it
been
used
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
first
page
(
which
fell
open
to
Mr.
Carson
's
view
)
were
written
the
names
of
his
children
,
and
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
Henry
John
,
son
of
the
above
John
and
Elizabeth
Carson
.
<EOS>
Born
Sept.
29th
,
1815
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
make
the
entry
complete
,
his
death
should
now
be
added
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
page
became
hidden
by
the
gathering
mist
of
tears
.
  
<EOS>
Thought
upon
thought
,
and
recollection
upon
recollection
came
crowding
in
,
from
the
remembrance
of
the
proud
day
when
he
had
purchased
the
costly
book
,
in
order
to
write
down
the
birth
of
the
little
babe
of
a
day
old
.
  
<EOS>
He
laid
his
head
down
on
the
open
page
,
and
let
the
tears
fall
slowly
on
the
spotless
leaves
.
  
<EOS>
His
son
's
murderer
was
discovered
;
had
confessed
his
guilt
,
and
yet
(
strange
to
say
)
<EOS>
he
could
not
hate
him
with
the
vehemence
of
hatred
he
had
felt
,
when
he
had
imagined
him
a
young
man
,
full
of
lusty
life
,
defying
all
laws
,
human
and
divine
.
 
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
desire
to
retain
the
revengeful
feeling
he
considered
as
a
duty
to
his
dead
son
,
something
of
pity
would
steal
in
for
the
poor
,
wasted
skeleton
of
a
man
,
the
smitten
creature
,
who
had
told
him
of
his
sin
,
and
implored
his
pardon
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
days
of
his
childhood
and
youth
,
Mr.
Carson
had
been
accustomed
to
poverty
;
but
it
was
honest
,
decent
poverty
;
not
the
grinding
squalid
misery
he
had
remarked
in
every
part
of
John
Barton
's
house
,
and
which
contrasted
strangely
with
the
pompous
sumptuousness
of
the
room
in
which
he
now
sat
.
 
<EOS>
Unaccustomed
wonder
filled
his
mind
at
the
reflection
of
the
different
lots
of
the
brethren
of
mankind
.
  
<EOS>
Then
he
roused
himself
from
his
reverie
,
and
turned
to
the
object
of
his
search
 
<EOS>
the
Gospel
,
where
he
half
expected
to
find
the
tender
pleading
:
"
<EOS>
They
know
not
what
they
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
murk
midnight
by
this
time
,
and
the
house
was
still
and
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
to
interrupt
the
old
man
in
his
unwonted
study
.
  
<EOS>
Years
ago
,
the
Gospel
had
been
his
task
-
book
in
learning
to
read
.
<EOS>
So
many
years
ago
,
that
he
had
become
familiar
with
the
events
before
he
could
comprehend
the
Spirit
that
made
the
Life
.
  
<EOS>
He
fell
to
the
narrative
now
afresh
,
with
all
the
interest
of
a
little
child
.
 
<EOS>
He
began
at
the
beginning
,
and
read
on
almost
greedily
,
understanding
for
the
first
time
the
full
meaning
of
the
story
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
to
the
end
;
<EOS>
the
awful
End
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
were
the
haunting
words
of
pleading
.
  
<EOS>
He
shut
the
book
,
and
thought
deeply
.
  
<EOS>
All
night
long
,
the
Archangel
combated
with
the
Demon
.
  
<EOS>
All
night
long
,
others
watched
by
the
bed
of
Death
.
 
<EOS>
John
Barton
had
revived
to
fitful
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
at
times
with
even
something
of
his
former
energy
;
and
in
the
racy
Lancashire
dialect
he
had
always
used
when
speaking

You
see
I
've
so
often
been
hankering
after
the
right
way
;
and
it
's
a
hard
one
for
a
poor
man
to
find
.
 
<EOS>
At
least
it
's
been
so
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
learned
me
,
and
no
one
telled
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
was
a
little
chap
they
taught
me
to
read
,
and
then
they
never
gave
no
books
;
only
I
heard
say
the
Bible
was
a
good
book
.
 
<EOS>
So
when
I
grew
thoughtful
,
and
puzzled
,
I
took
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
'd
never
believe
black
was
black
,
or
night
was
night
,
when
you
saw
all
about
you
acting
as
if
black
was
white
,
and
night
was
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
much
I
can
say
for
myself
in
t'other
world
.
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
me
;
but
I
can
say
this
,
I
would
fain
have
gone
after
the
Bible
rules
if
I
'd
seen
folk
credit
it
;
they
all
spoke
up
for
it
,
and
went
and
did
clean
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
In
those
days
I
would
ha
'
gone
about
wi
'
my
Bible
,
like
a
little
child
,
my
finger
in
th
'
place
,
and
asking
the
meaning
of
this
or
that
text
,
and
no
one
told
me
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
took
out
two
or
three
texts
as
clear
as
glass
,
and
I
tried
to
do
what
they
bid
me
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
know
how
it
was
,
<EOS>
masters
and
men
,
all
alike
cared
no
more
for
minding
those
texts
,
than
I
did
for
th
'
Lord
Mayor
of
London
;
so
I
grew
to
think
it
must
be
a
sham
put
upon
poor
ignorant
folk
,
women
,
and
such
like
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
long
I
tried
to
live
Gospel
-
wise
,
but
it
was
liker
heaven
than
any
other
bit
of
earth
has
been
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
old
Alice
to
strengthen
me
;
but
every
one
else
said
,
"
Stand
up
for
thy
rights
,
or
thou'lt
never
get
'
em
"
;
and
wife
and
children
never
spoke
,
but
their
helplessness
cried
aloud
,
and
I
was
driven
to
do
as
others
did
 
<EOS>
and
then
Tom
died
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
all
about
that
 
<EOS>
I
'm
getting
scant
o
'
<EOS>
breath
,
and
blind
-
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
again
he
spoke
,
after
some
minutes
of
hushed
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
along
it
came
natural
to
love
folk
,
though
now
I
am
what
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
think
one
time
I
could
e'en
have
loved
the
masters
if
they
'd
ha
'
letten
me
;
that
was
in
my
Gospel
-
days
,
<EOS>
afore
my
child
died
o
'
hunger
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
tore
in
two
oftentimes
,
between
my
sorrow
for
poor
suffering
folk
,
and
my
trying
to
love
them
as
caused
their
sufferings
(
to
my
mind
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
last
I
gave
it
up
in
despair
,
trying
to
make
folks
'
actions
square
wi
'
th
'
Bible
;
and
I
thought
I
'd
no
longer
labour
at
following
th
'
Bible
mysel
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
said
all
this
afore
,
maybe
.
 
<EOS>
But
from
that
time
I
've
dropped
down
,
down
 
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
that
he
only
spoke
in
broken
sentences
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
think
he
'd
been
such
an
old
man
,
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
that
he
had
but
forgiven
me
,
"
 
and
then
came
earnest
,
passionate
,
broken
words
of
prayer
.
  
<EOS>
Job
Legh
had
gone
home
like
one
struck
down
with
the
unexpected
shock
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
and
Jem
together
waited
the
approach
of
death
;
but
as
the
final
struggle
drew
on
,
and
morning
dawned
,
Jem
suggested
some
alleviation
to
the
gasping
breath
,
to
purchase
which
he
left
the
house
in
search
of
a
druggist
's
shop
,
which
should
be
open
at
that
early
hour
.
  
<EOS>
During
his
absence
,
Barton
grew
worse
;
he
had
fallen
across
the
bed
,
and
his
breathing
seemed
almost
stopped
;
in
vain
did
Mary
strive
to
raise
him
,
<EOS>
her
sorrow
and
exhaustion
had
rendered
her
too
weak
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
on
hearing
some
one
enter
the
house
-
place
below
<EOS>
,
she
cried
out
for
Jem
to
come
to
her
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
A
step
,
which
was
not
Jem
's
,
came
up
the
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
stood
in
the
doorway
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
instant
he
comprehended
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
He
raised
up
the
powerless
frame
;
and
the
departing
soul
looked
out
of
the
eyes
with
gratitude
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
the
dying
man
propped
in
his
arms
.
  
<EOS>
John
Barton
folded
his
hands
as
if
in
prayer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
for
us
,
"
said
Mary
,
sinking
on
her
knees
,
and
forgetting
in
that
solemn
hour
all
that
had
divided
her
father
and
Mr.
Carson
.
  
<EOS>
No
other
words
would
suggest
themselves
than
some
of
those
he
had
read
only
a
few
hours
before
   
<EOS>
"
God
be
merciful
to
us
sinners
.
 
<EOS>
Forgive
us
our
trespasses
as
we
forgive
them
that
trespass
against
us
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
when
the
words
were
said
,
John
Barton
lay
a
corpse
in
Mr.
Carson
's
arms
.
  
<EOS>
So
ended
the
tragedy
of
a
poor
man
's
life
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
knew
nothing
more
for
many
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
recovered
consciousness
,
she
found
herself
supported
by
Jem
on
the
"
settle
"
in
the
house
-
place
.
 
<EOS>
Job
and
Mr.
Carson
were
there
,
talking
together
lowly
and
solemnly
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Carson
bade
farewell
and
left
the
house
;
and
Job
said
aloud
,
but
as
if
speaking
to
himself
   
<EOS>
"
God
has
heard
that
man
's
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
comforted
him

JEM
'S
INTERVIEW
WITH
MR

<EOS>

The

dark
day
of
nothingness
,
The
last
of

and

BYRON
.
  
<EOS>
Although
Mary
had
hardly
been
conscious
of
her
thoughts
,
and
it
had
been
more
like
a
secret
instinct
informing
her
soul
,
than
the
result
of
any
process
of
reasoning
,
she
had
felt
for
some
time
(
ever
since
her
return
from
Liverpool
,
in
fact
)
,
that
for
her
father
there
was
but
one
thing
to
be
desired
and
anticipated
,
and
that
was
death
!
  
<EOS>
She
had
seen
that
Conscience
had
given
the
mortal
wound
to
his
earthly
frame
;
she
did
not
dare
to
question
of
the
infinite
mercy
of
God
,
what
the
Future
Life
would
be
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Though
at
first
desolate
and
stunned
by
the
blow
which
had
fallen
on
herself
,
she
was
resigned
and
submissive
as
soon
as
she
recovered
strength
enough
to
ponder
and
consider
a
little
;
and
you
may
be
sure
that
no
tenderness
or
love
was
wanting
on
Jem
's
part
,
and
no
consideration
and
sympathy
on
that
of
Job
and
Margaret
to
soothe
and
comfort
the
girl
who
now
stood
alone
in
the
world
as
far
as
blood
relations
were
concerned
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
ask
or
care
to
know
what
arrangements
they
were
making
in
whispered
tones
with
regard
to
the
funeral
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
herself
into
their
hands
with
the
trust
of
a
little
child
;
glad
to
be
undisturbed
in
the
reveries
and
remembrances
which
filled
her
eyes
with
tears
,
and
caused
them
to
fall
quietly
,
down
her
pale
cheeks
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
longest
day
she
had
ever
known
in
her
life
;
every
change
and
every
occupation
was
taken
away
from
her
:
but
perhaps
the
length
of
quiet
time
thus
afforded
was
really
good
,
although
its
duration
weighed
upon
her
;
for
by
this
means
she
contemplated
her
situation
in
every
light
,
and
fully
understood
that
the
morning
's
event
had
left
her
an
orphan
;
and
thus
she
was
spared
the
pangs
caused
to
us
by
the
occurrence
of
death
in
the
evening
,
just
before
we
should
naturally
,
in
the
usual
course
of
events
,
lie
down
to
slumber
.
 
<EOS>
For
in
such
case
,
worn
out
by
anxiety
,
and
it
may
be
by
much
watching
,
our
very
excess
of
grief
rocks
itself
to
sleep
,
before
we
have
had
time
to
realise
its
cause
;
and
we
waken
,
with
a
start
of
agony
like
a
fresh
stab
,
to
the
consciousness
of
the
one
awful
vacancy
,
which
shall
never
,
while
the
world
endures
,
be
filled
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
day
brought
its
burden
of
duty
to
Mrs.
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
She
felt
bound
by
regard
,
as
well
as
by
etiquette
,
to
go
and
see
her
future
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
And
by
an
old
association
of
ideas
(
perhaps
of
death
with
churchyards
,
and
churches
with
Sunday
)
<EOS>
she
thought
it
necessary
to
put
on
her
best
,
and
latterly
unused
clothes
,
the
airing
of
which
on
a
little
clothes
-
horse
before
the
fire
seemed
to
give
her
a
not
unpleasing
occupation
.
  
<EOS>
When
Jem
returned
home
late
in
the
evening
succeeding
John
Barton
's
death
,
weary
and
oppressed
with
the
occurrences
and
excitements
of
the
day
,
he
found
his
mother
busy
about
her
mourning
,
and
much
inclined
to
talk
.
 
<EOS>
Although
he
longed
for
quiet
,
he
could
not
avoid
sitting
down
and
answering
her
questions
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Jem
,
he
's
gone
at
last
,
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
How
did
you
hear
,
mother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Job
came
over
here
,
and
telled
me
,
on
his
way
to
the
undertaker
's
.
 
<EOS>
Did
he
make
a
fine
end
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
struck
Jem
that
she
had
not
heard
of
the
confession
which
had
been
made
by
John
Barton
on
his
death
-
bed
;
he
remembered
Job
Legh
's
discretion
,
and
he
determined
that
if
it
could
be
avoided
his
mother
should
never
hear
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
the
difficulties
to
be
anticipated
in
preserving
the
secret
would
be
obviated
,
if
he
could
induce
his
mother
to
fall
into
the
plan
he
had
named
to
Mary
of
emigrating
to
Canada
.
 
<EOS>
The
reasons
which
rendered
this
secrecy
desirable
related
to
the
domestic
happiness
he
hoped
for
.
 
<EOS>
With
his
mother
's
irritable
temper
he
could
hardly
expect
that
all
allusion
to
the
crime
of
John
Barton
would
be
for
ever
restrained
from
passing
her
lips
,
and
he
knew
the
deep
trial
which
such
references
would
be
to
Mary
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
he
resolved
as
soon
as
possible
in
the
morning
to
go
to
Job
and
beseech
his
silence
;
he
trusted
that
secrecy
in
that
quarter
,
even
if
the
knowledge
had
been
extended
to
Margaret
,
might
be
easily
secured
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
would
be
Mr.
Carson
's
course
?
  
<EOS>
Were
there
any
means
by
which
he
might
be
persuaded
to
spare
John
Barton
's
memory
?
  
<EOS>
He
was
roused
up
from
this
train
of
thought
by
his
mother
's
more
irritated
tone
of
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jem
!
"
she
was
saying
,
"
thou
mightst
just
as
well
never
be
at
a
death
-
bed
again
,
if
thou
can
not
bring
off
more
news
about
it
;
here
have
I
been
by
mysel
all
day
(
except
when
oud
Job
came
in
)
,
but
thinks
I
when
Jem
comes
he
'll
be
sure
to
be
good
company
,
seeing
he
was
in
the
house
at
the
very
time
of
the
death
;
and
here
thou
art
,
without
a
word
to
throw
at
a
dog
,
much
less
thy
mother
<EOS>
:
it
's
no
use
thy
going
to
a
death
-
bed
if
thou
can
not
carry
away
any
of
the
sayings
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
not
make
any
,
mother
,
"
replied
Jem
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
So
fond
as
he
used
to
be
of
holding
forth
,
to
miss
such
a
fine
opportunity
that
will
never
come
again
!
 
<EOS>
Did
he
die
easy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
very
restless
all
night
long
,
"
said
Jem
,
reluctantly
returning
to
the
thoughts
of
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
in
course
thou
plucked
the
pillow
away
?
 
<EOS>
Thou
didst
not
!
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
with
thy
bringing
up
,
and
thy
learning
,
thou
mightst
have
known
that
were
the
only
help
in
such
a
case
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
pigeons
'
feathers
in
the
pillow
,
depend
on't
.
 
<EOS>
To
think
of
two
grown
-
up
folk
like
you
and
Mary
,
not
knowing
death
could
never
come
easy
to
a
person
lying
on
a
pillow
with
pigeons
'
feathers
in
!
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
was
glad
to
escape
from
all
this
talking
,
to
the
solitude
and
quiet
of
his
own
room
,
where
he
could
lie
and
think
uninterruptedly
of
what
had
happened
and
remained
to
be
done
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
thing
was
to
seek
an
interview
with
Mr.
Duncombe
,
his
former
master
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
early
the
next
morning
Jem
set
off
on
his
walk
to
the
works
,
where
for
so
many
years
his
days
had
been
spent
;
where
for
so
long
a
time
his
thoughts
had
been
thought
,
his
hopes
and
fears
experienced
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
cheering
feeling
to
remember
that
henceforward
he
was
to
be
severed
from
all
these
familiar
places
;
nor
were
his
spirits
enlivened
by
the
evident
feelings
of
the
majority
of
those
who
had
been
his
fellow
-
workmen
.
<EOS>
As
he
stood
in
the
entrance
to
the
foundry
,
awaiting
Mr.
Duncombe
's
leisure
,
many
of
those
employed
in
the
works
passed
him
on
their
return
from
breakfast
;
and
,
with
one
or
two
exceptions
,
without
any
acknowledgment
of
former
acquaintance
beyond
a
distant
nod
at
the
utmost
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
hard
,
"
said
Jem
to
himself
,
with
a
bitter
and
indignant
feeling
rising
in
his
throat
,
"
that
let
a
man
's
life
be
what
it
may
,
folk
are
so
ready
to
credit
the
first
word
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
live
it
down
if
I
stayed
in
England
;
but
then
what
would
not
Mary
have
to
bear
?
 
<EOS>
Sooner
or
later
the
truth
would
out
;
and
then
she
would
be
a
show
to
folk
for
many
a
day

John
Barton
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
God
does
not
judge
as
hardly
as
man

that
's
one
comfort
for
all
of
us

<EOS>
Mr.
Duncombe
did
not
believe
in
Jem
's
guilt
,
in
spite
of
the
silence
in
which
he
again
this
day
heard
the
imputation
of
it
;
but
he
agreed
that
under
the
circumstances
it
was
better
he
should
leave
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
written
to
by
Government
,
as
I
think
I
told
you
before
,
to
recommend
an
intelligent
man
,
well
acquainted
with
mechanics
,
as
instrument
-
maker
to
the
Agricultural
College
they
are
establishing
at
Toronto
,
in
Canada
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
comfortable
appointment
,
 
house
,
 
land
,
 
and
a
good
percentage
on
the
instruments
made
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
show
you
the
particulars
if
I
can
lay
my
hand
on
the
letter
,
which
I
believe
I
must
have
left
at
home

<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir

<EOS>
No
need
for
seeing
the
letter
to
say
I
'll
accept
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
leave
Manchester
;
and
I
'd
as
lief
quit
England
at
once
when
I
'm
about
it

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
Government
will
give
you
your
passage
;
indeed
,
I
believe
an
allowance
would
be
made
for
a
family
if
you
had
one
;

you
are
not
a
married
man

I
believe
?

<EOS>
"
No

<EOS>
J
<EOS>
em
hung
back
from
a
confession
with
the
awkwardness
of
a
girl

<EOS>

But
"
 
s
aid
Mr.
Duncombe
,
smiling
,
"
you
would
like
to
be
a
married
man

you
go

I

,
Wilson

<EOS>
"
If
you
please

<EOS>
And
there
's
my
mother
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
she
'll
go
with
us

<EOS>
But
I
can
pay
her
passage
;
no
need
to
trouble
Government

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
write
to
-
day
and
recommend
you
;
and
say
that
you
have
a
family
of
two
.
 
<EOS>
They
'll
never
ask
if
the
family
goes
upwards
or
downwards

<EOS>
I
shall
see
you
again
before
you
sail
<EOS>
,
I
hope

Wilson

though
I
believe
they
'll
not
allow
you
long
to
wait
.
 
<EOS>
Come
to
my
house
next
time
;
you
'll
find
it
pleasanter

I
dare
say

<EOS>
These
men
are
so
wrong
-
headed

<EOS>
Keep
up
your
heart
!
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
felt
that
it
was
a
relief
to
have
this
point
settled
;
and
that
he
need
no
longer
weigh
reasons
for
and
against
his
emigration
.
  
<EOS>
And
with
his
path
growing
clearer
and
clearer
before
him
the
longer
he
contemplated
it
<EOS>
,
he
went
to
see
Mary
,
and
if
he
judged
it
fit
,
to
tell
her
what
he
had
decided
upon
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
was
sitting
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Grandfather
wants
to
see
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
to
Jem
on
his
entrance
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
want
to
see
him
,
"
replied
Jem
,
suddenly
remembering
his
last
night
's
determination
to
enjoin
secrecy
on
Job
Legh
.
  
<EOS>
So
he
hardly
stayed
to
kiss
poor
Mary
's
sweet
woe
-
begone
face
,
but
tore
himself
away
from
his
darling
to
go
to
the
old
man
,
who
awaited
him
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
getten
a
note
from
Mr.
Carson
,
"
exclaimed
Job
<EOS>
the
moment
he
saw
Jem
;
"
and
,
man
alive
,
he
wants
to
see
thee
and
me
!
 
<EOS>
For
sure
,
there
's
no
more
mischief
up
,
is
there
?
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
looking
at
Jem
with
an
expression
of
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
any
suspicion
mingled
for
an
instant
with
the
thoughts
that
crossed
Job
's
mind
,
it
was
immediately
dispelled
by
Jem
's
honest
,
fearless
,
open
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
guess
what
he
's
wanting
,
poor
old
chap
,
"
answered
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Maybe
there
's
some
point
<EOS>
he
's
not
yet
satisfied
on
;
maybe
 
<EOS>
but
it
's
no
use
guessing
;
let
's
be
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
n't
be
better
for
thee
to
be
scarce
a
bit
,
would
it
,
and
leave
me
to
go
and
find
out
what
's
up
?
 
<EOS>
He
has
,
perhaps
,
getten
some
crotchet
into
his
head
thou'rt
an
accomplice
,
and
is
laying
a
trap
for
thee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
afeard
!
"
<EOS>
said
Jem
;
"
I
've
done
nought
wrong
,
and
know
nought
wrong
,
about
yon
poor
dead
lad
;
though
I
'll
own
<EOS>
I
had
evil
thoughts
once
on
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
Folk
ca
n't
mistake
long
if
once
they
'll
search
into
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
and
give
the
old
gentleman
all
the
satisfaction
in
my
power
,
now
it
can
injure
no
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
my
reasons
for
wanting
to
see
him
besides
,
and
it
all
falls
in
right
enough
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Job
was
a
little
reassured
by
Jem
's
boldness
;
but
still
,
if
the
truth
must
be
told
,
he
wished
the
young
man
would
follow
his
advice
,
and
leave
him
to
sound
Mr.
Carson
's
intentions
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Jane
Wilson
had
donned
her
Sunday
suit
of
black
,
and
set
off
on
her
errand
of
condolence
.
 
<EOS>
She
felt
nervous
and
uneasy
at
the
idea
of
the
moral
sayings
and
texts
which
she
fancied
were
expected
from
visitors
on
occasions
like
the
present
;
and
prepared
many
a
good
set
speech
as
she
walked
towards
the
house
of
mourning
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
gently
opened
the
door
,
Mary
,
sitting
idly
by
the
fire
,
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
,
 
of
Jem
's
mother
,
 
of
the
early
friend
of
her
dead
parents
,
 
of
the
kind
minister
to
many
a
little
want
in
days
of
childhood
,
 
and
rose
and
came
and
fell
about
her
neck
,
with
many
a
sob
and
moan
,
saying
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
's
gone
 
<EOS>
he
's
dead
 
<EOS>
all
gone
 
all
dead
,
and
I
am
left
alone
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
wench
!
<EOS>
poor
,
poor
wench
!
"
said
Jane
Wilson
,
tenderly
kissing
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou'rt
not
alone
;
so
donnot
take
on
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
say
nought
of
Him
who
's
above
,
for
thou
knowest
<EOS>
He
is
ever
the
orphan
's
friend
;
but
think
on
Jem
!
<EOS>
nay
,
Mary
,
<EOS>
dear
,
think
on
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
but
a
frabbit
woman
at
times
,
but
I
've
a
heart
within
me
through
all
my
temper
,
and
thou
shalt
be
as
a
daughter
henceforward
,
 
as
mine
own
ewe
-
lamb
.
<EOS>
Jem
shall
not
love
thee
better
in
his
way
,
than
I
will
in
mine
;
and
thou'lt
bear
with
my
turns
,
Mary
,
knowing
that
in
my
soul
God
sees
the
love
that
shall
ever
be
thine
,
if
thou'lt
take
me
for
thy
mother
,
and
speak
no
more
of
being
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilson
was
weeping
herself
long
before
she
had
ended
this
speech
,
which
was
so
different
to
all
she
had
planned
to
say
,
and
from
all
the
formal
piety
she
had
laid
in
store
for
the
visit
;
for
this
was
heart
's
piety
,
and
needed
no
garnish
of
texts
to
make
it
true
religion
,
pure
and
undefiled
.
  
<EOS>
They
sat
together
on
the
same
chair
,
their
arms
encircling
each
other
;
they
wept
for
the
same
dead
;
they
had
the
same
hope
,
and
trust
,
and
overflowing
love
in
the
living
.
  
<EOS>
From
that
time
forward
,
hardly
a
passing
cloud
dimmed
the
happy
confidence
of
their
intercourse
;
even
by
Jem
would
his
mother
's
temper
sooner
be
irritated
than
by
Mary
;
before
the
latter
she
repressed
her
occasional
nervous
ill
-
humour
till
the
habit
of
indulging
it
was
perceptibly
decreased
.
  
<EOS>
Years
afterwards
,
in
conversation
with
Jem
,
he
was
startled
by
a
chance
expression
which
dropped
from
his
mother
's
lips
;
it
implied
a
knowledge
of
John
Barton
's
crime
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
many
a
long
day
since
they
had
seen
any
Manchester
people
who
could
have
revealed
the
secret
(
if
indeed
it
was
known
in
Manchester
,
against
which
Jem
had
guarded
in
every
possible
way
)
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
was
led
to
inquire
first
as
to
the
extent
,
and
then
as
to
the
source
of
her
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Mary
herself
who
had
told
all
.
  
<EOS>
For
on
the
morning
to
which
this
chapter
principally
relates
,
as
Mary
sat
weeping
,
and
as
Mrs.
Wilson
comforted
her
by
every
tenderest
word
and
caress
,
she
revealed
,
to
the
dismayed
and
astonished
Jane
,
the
sting
of
her
deep
sorrow
;
the
crime
which
stained
her
dead
father
's
memory
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
quite
unconscious
that
Jem
had
kept
it
secret
from
his
mother
;
she
had
imagined
it
bruited
abroad
as
the
suspicion
against
her
lover
had
been
;
so
word
after
word
(
dropped
from
her
lips
in
the
supposition
that
Mrs.
Wilson
knew
all
)
<EOS>
had
told
the
tale
and
revealed
the
cause
of
her
deep
anguish
;
deeper
than
is
ever
caused
by
death
alone
.
  
<EOS>
On
large
occasions
like
the
present
,
Mrs.
Wilson
's
innate
generosity
came
out
.
 
<EOS>
Her
weak
and
ailing
frame
imparted
its
irritation
to
her
conduct
in
small
things
,
and
daily
trifles
;
but
she
had
deep
and
noble
sympathy
with
great
sorrows
,
and
even
at
the
time
that
Mary
spoke
she
allowed
no
expression
of
surprise
or
horror
to
escape
her
lips
.
 
<EOS>
She
gave
way
to
no
curiosity
as
to
the
untold
details
;
she
was
as
secret
and
trustworthy
as
her
son
himself
;
and
if
in
years
to
come
her
anger
was
occasionally
excited
against
Mary
,
and
she
,
on
rare
occasions
,
yielded
to
ill
-
temper
against
her
daughter
-
in
-
law
,
she
would
upbraid
her
for
extravagance
,
or
stinginess
,
or
over
-
dressing
,
or
under
-
dressing
,
or
too
much
mirth
or
too
much
gloom
,
but
never
,
never
in
her
most
uncontrolled
moments
did
she
allude
to
any
one
of
the
circumstances
relating
to
Mary
's
flirtation
with
Harry
Carson
,
or
his
murderer
;
and
always
when
she
spoke
of
John
Barton
,
named
him
with
the
respect
due
to
his
conduct
before
the
last
,
miserable
,
guilty
month
of
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
Therefore
it
came
like
a
blow
to
Jem
,
when
,
after
years
had
passed
away
,
he
gathered
his
mother
's
knowledge
of
the
whole
affair
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
day
when
he
learnt
(
not
without
remorse
)
<EOS>
what
hidden
depths
of
self
-
restraint
she
had
in
her
soul
,
his
manner
to
her
,
always
tender
and
respectful
,
became
reverential
;
and
it
was
more
than
ever
a
loving
strife
between
him
and
Mary
which
should
most
contribute
towards
the
happiness
of
the
declining
years
of
their
mother
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
am
speaking
of
the
events
which
have
occurred
only
lately
,
while
I
have
yet
many
things
to
tell
you
that
happened
six
or
seven
years
ago
.

DETAILS
CONNECTED
WITH
THE
MURDER

The

dines

while
the
poor
man
pines
,
And
eats
his
heart
away

<EOS>
The
Dream
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
stood
at
one
of
the
breathing
-
moments
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
The
object
of
the
toils
,
the
fears
,
and
the
wishes
of
his
past
years
,
was
suddenly
hidden
from
his
sight
,
 
vanished
into
the
deep
mystery
which
circumscribes
existence
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
even
the
vengeance
which
he
had
cherished
,
taken
away
from
before
his
eyes
,
as
by
the
hand
of
God
.
  
<EOS>
Events
like
these
would
have
startled
the
most
thoughtless
into
reflection
,
much
more
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Carson
,
whose
mind
,
if
not
enlarged
,
was
energetic
;
indeed
,
whose
very
energy
,
having
been
hitherto
the
cause
of
the
employment
of
his
powers
in
only
one
direction
,
had
prevented
him
from
becoming
largely
and
philosophically
comprehensive
in
his
views
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
the
foundations
of
his
past
life
were
razed
to
the
ground
,
and
the
place
they
had
once
occupied
was
sown
with
salt
,
to
be
rebuilt
no
more
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
like
the
change
from
this
Life
to
that
other
hidden
one
,
when
so
many
of
the
motives
which
have
actuated
all
our
earthly
existence
,
will
have
become
more
fleeting
than
the
shadows
of
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
wrench
of
his
soul
from
the
past
,
so
much
of
which
was
as
nothing
,
and
worse
than
nothing
to
him
now
,
Mr.
Carson
took
some
hours
,
after
he
had
witnessed
the
death
of
his
son
's
murderer
,
to
consider
his
situation
.
  
<EOS>
But
suddenly
,
while
he
was
deliberating
,
and
searching
for
motives
which
should
be
effective
to
compel
him
to
exertion
and
action
once
more
;
while
he
contemplated
the
desire
after
riches
,
social
distinction
,
a
name
among
the
merchant
-
princes
amidst
whom
he
moved
,
and
saw
these
false
substances
fade
away
into
the
shadows
they
truly
are
,
and
one
by
one
disappear
into
the
grave
of
his
son
,
 
suddenly
,
I
say
,
the
thought
arose
within
him
that
more
yet
remained
to
be
learned
about
the
circumstances
and
feelings
which
had
prompted
John
Barton
's
crime
;
and
when
once
this
mournful
curiosity
was
excited
,
it
seemed
to
gather
strength
in
every
moment
that
its
gratification
was
delayed
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
he
sent
a
message
to
summon
Job
Legh
and
Jem
Wilson
,
from
whom
he
promised
himself
some
elucidation
of
what
was
as
yet
unexplained
;
while
he
himself
set
forth
to
call
on
Mr.
Bridgnorth
,
whom
he
knew
to
have
been
Jem
's
attorney
,
with
a
glimmering
suspicion
intruding
on
his
mind
,
which
he
strove
to
repel
,
that
Jem
might
have
had
some
share
in
his
son
's
death
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
returned
before
his
summoned
visitors
arrived
;
and
had
time
enough
to
recur
to
the
evening
on
which
John
Barton
had
made
his
confession
.
 
<EOS>
He
remembered
with
mortification
how
he
had
forgotten
his
proud
reserve
,
and
his
habitual
concealment
of
his
feelings
,
and
had
laid
bare
his
agony
of
grief
in
the
presence
of
these
two
men
who
were
coming
to
see
him
by
his
desire
;
and
he
entrenched
himself
behind
stiff
barriers
of
self
-
control
,
through
which
he
hoped
no
appearance
of
emotion
would
force
its
way
in
the
conversation
he
anticipated
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
when
the
servant
announced
that
two
men
were
there
by
appointment
to
speak
to
him
,
and
he
had
desired
that
they
might
be
shown
into
the
library
where
he
sat
,
any
watcher
might
have
perceived
by
the
trembling
hands
,
and
shaking
head
,
not
only
how
much
he
was
aged
by
the
occurrences
of
the
last
few
weeks
,
but
also
how
much
he
was
agitated
at
the
thought
of
the
impending
interview
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
so
far
succeeded
in
commanding
himself
at
first
,
as
to
appear
to
Jem
Wilson
and
<EOS>
Job
Legh
one
of
the
hardest
and
most
haughty
men
they
had
ever
spoken
to
,
and
to
forfeit
all
the
interest
which
he
had
previously
excited
in
their
minds
by
his
unreserved
display
of
deep
and
genuine
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
desired
them
to
be
seated
,
he
shaded
his
face
with
his
hand
for
an
instant
before
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
calling
on
Mr.
Bridgnorth
this
morning
,
"
said
he
,
at
last
;
"
as
I
expected
,
he
can
give
me
but
<EOS>
little
satisfaction
on
some
points
respecting
the
occurrence
on
the
18th
of
last
month
which
I
desire
to
have
cleared
up
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
two
can
tell
me
what
I
want
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
As
intimate
friends
of
Barton
's
you
probably
know
,
or
can
conjecture
a
good
deal
.
 
<EOS>
Have
no
scruple
as
to
speaking
the
truth
.
<EOS>
What
you
say
in
this
room
shall
never
be
named
again
by
me
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
you
are
aware
that
the
law
allows
no
one
to
be
tried
twice
for
the
same
offence
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
for
a
minute
,
for
the
mere
act
of
speaking
was
fatiguing
to
him
after
the
excitement
of
the
last
few
days
.
  
<EOS>
Job
Legh
took
the
opportunity
of
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
going
to
be
affronted
either
for
myself
or
Jem
at
what
you
've
just
now
been
saying
about
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
us
,
and
there
's
an
end
on't
;
only
it
's
as
well
for
folk
to
think
others
good
and
true
until
they
're
proved
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
Ask
what
you
like
,
sir
,
I
'll
answer
for
it
<EOS>
we
'll
either
tell
truth
or
hold
our
tongues
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
said
Mr.
Carson
,
slightly
bowing
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
wish
to
know
was
,
"
referring
to
a
slip
of
paper
he
held
in
his
hand
,
and
shaking
so
much
he
could
hardly
adjust
his
glasses
to
his
eyes
,
"
whether
you
,
Wilson
,
can
explain
how
Barton
came
possessed
of
your
gun
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
refused
this
explanation
to
Mr.
Bridgnorth
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
said
what
I
knew
then
,
I
saw
it
would
criminate
Barton
,
and
so
I
refused
telling
aught
.
 
<EOS>
To
you
,
sir
,
now
I
will
tell
everything
and
anything
;
only
it
is
but
little
.
 
<EOS>
The
gun
was
my
father
's
before
it
was
mine
,
and
long
ago
he
and
John
Barton
had
a
fancy
for
shooting
at
the
gallery
;
and
they
used
always
to
take
this
gun
,
and
brag
that
though
it
was
old
-
fashioned
it
was
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
saw
with
self
-
upbraiding
pain
how
Mr.
Carson
winced
at
these
last
words
,
but
at
each
irrepressible
and
involuntary
evidence
of
feeling
,
the
hearts
of
the
two
men
warmed
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
went
on
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
day
in
the
week
 
I
think
it
was
on
the
Wednesday
,
 
<EOS>
yes
,
it
was
 
<EOS>
it
was
on
St.
Patrick
's
day
,
I
met
John
just
coming
out
of
our
house
,
as
I
were
going
to
my
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Mother
was
out
,
and
he
'd
found
no
one
in
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
'd
come
to
borrow
the
old
gun
,
and
that
he
'd
have
made
bold
,
and
taken
it
,
but
it
was
not
to
be
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Mother
was
afraid
of
it
,
so
after
father
's
death
(
for
while
he
were
alive
,
she
seemed
to
think
he
could
manage
it
)
<EOS>
I
had
carried
it
to
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
I
went
up
and
fetched
it
for
John
,
who
stood
outside
the
door
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
say
he
wanted
it
for
?
"
asked
Mr.
Carson
hastily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
he
spoke
when
I
gave
it
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
he
muttered
something
about
the
shooting
gallery
,
and
I
never
doubted
but
that
it
was
for
practice
there
,
as
I
knew
he
had
done
years
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
had
strung
up
his
frame
to
an
attitude
of
upright
attention
while
Jem
was
speaking
;
now
the
tension
relaxed
,
and
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
,
weak
and
powerless
.
  
<EOS>
He
rose
up
again
,
however
,
as
Jem
went
on
,
anxious
to
give
every
particular
which
could
satisfy
the
bereaved
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
knew
for
what
he
wanted
the
gun
till
I
was
taken
up
,
 
I
do
not
know
yet
why
he
wanted
it
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
would
have
had
me
get
out
of
the
scrape
by
implicating
an
old
friend
,
 
my
father
's
old
friend
,
and
the
father
of
the
girl
I
loved
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
refused
to
tell
Mr.
Bridgnorth
aught
about
it
,
and
would
not
have
named
it
now
to
any
one
but
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
's
face
became
very
red
at
the
allusion
he
made
to
Mary
,
but
his
honest
,
fearless
eyes
had
met
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
's
penetrating
gaze
unflinchingly
,
and
had
carried
conviction
of
his
innocence
and
truthfulness
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
felt
certain
that
he
had
heard
all
that
Jem
could
tell
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
he
turned
to
Job
Legh
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
in
the
room
the
whole
time
while
Barton
was
speaking
to
me
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
answered
Job
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
excuse
my
asking
plain
and
direct
questions
;
the
information
I
am
gaining
is
really
a
relief
to
my
mind
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
how
,
but
it
is
,
 
will
you
tell
me
if
you
had
any
idea
of
Barton
's
guilt
in
this
matter
before
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
whatever
,
so
help
me
God
!
"
said
Job
solemnly
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
tell
truth
(
and
axing
your
forgiveness
,
Jem
)
,
I
had
never
got
quite
shut
of
the
notion
that
Jem
here
had
done
it
.
 
<EOS>
At
times
I
was
as
clear
of
his
innocence
as
I
was
of
my
own
;
and
whenever
I
took
to
reasoning
about
it
,
I
saw
he
could
not
have
been
the
man
that
did
it
.
 
<EOS>
Still
I
never
thought
of
Barton
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
yet
by
his
confession
he
must
have
been
absent
at
the
time
,
"
said
Mr.
Carson
,
referring
to
his
slip
of
paper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
and
for
many
a
day
after
,
 
I
ca
n't
rightly
say
how
long
.
 
<EOS>
But
still
,
you
see
,
one
's
often
blind
to
many
a
thing
that
lies
right
under
one
's
nose
,
till
it
's
pointed
out
.
 
<EOS>
And
till
I
heard
what
John
Barton
had
to
say
yon
night
,
I
could
not
have
seen
what
reason
he
had
for
doing
it
;
while
in
the
case
of
Jem
,
any
one
who
looked
at
Mary
Barton
might
have
seen
a
cause
for
jealousy
clear
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
believe
that
Barton
had
no
knowledge
of
<EOS>
my
son
's
unfortunate
"
 
h
e
looked
at
Jem
 
"
of
his
attentions
to
Mary
Barton
.
<EOS>
This
young
man
,
Wilson
,
has
heard
of
them
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
person
who
told
me
said
clearly
she
neither
had
,
nor
would
tell
Mary
's
father
,
"
interposed
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
he
'd
ever
heard
of
it
;
he
were
n't
a
man
to
keep
still
in
such
a
matter
,
if
he
had
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
"
said
Job
,
"
the
reason
he
gave
on
his
death
-
bed
,
so
to
speak
,
was
enough
;
'
specially
to
those
who
knew
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
his
feelings
regarding
the
treatment
of
the
workmen
by
the
masters
;
you
think
he
acted
from
motives
of
revenge
,
in
consequence
of
the
part
my
son
had
taken
in
putting
down
the
strike
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
replied
Job
,
<EOS>
"
it
's
hard
to
say
:
John
Barton
was
not
a
man
to
take
counsel
with
people
;
nor
did
he
make
many
words
about
his
doings
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
can
only
judge
from
his
way
of
thinking
and
talking
in
general
,
never
having
heard
him
breathe
a
syllable
concerning
this
matter
in
particular
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
he
were
sadly
put
about
to
make
great
riches
and
great
poverty
square
with
Christ
's
Gospel
"
 
J
ob
paused
,
in
order
to
try
and
express
what
was
clear
enough
in
his
own
mind
,
as
to
the
effect
produced
on
John
Barton
by
the
great
and
mocking
contrasts
presented
by
the
varieties
of
human
condition
.
 
<EOS>
Before
he
could
find
suitable
words
to
explain
his
meaning
,
Mr.
Carson
spoke
.
<EOS>
"
You
mean
he
was
an
Owenite
;
all
for
equality
and
community
of
goods
,
and
that
kind
of
absurdity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
John
Barton
was
no
fool
.
 
<EOS>
No
need
to
tell
him
that
were
all
men
equal
to
-
night
,
some
would
get
the
start
by
rising
an
hour
earlier
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
yet
did
he
care
for
goods
,
nor
wealth
 
<EOS>
no
man
less
,
so
that
he
could
get
daily
bread
for
him
and
his
;
but
what
hurt
him
sore
,
and
rankled
in
him
as
long
as
I
knew
him
(
and
,
sir
,
it
rankles
in
many
a
poor
man
's
heart
far
more
than
the
want
of
any
creature
-
comforts
,
and
puts
a
sting
into
starvation
itself
)
,
was
that
those
who
wore
finer
clothes
,
and
eat
better
food
,
and
had
more
money
in
their
pockets
,
kept
him
at
arm
's
length
,
and
cared
not
whether
his
heart
was
sorry
or
glad
;
whether
he
lived
or
died
,
  
whether
he
was
bound
for
heaven
or
hell
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
hard
to
him
that
a
heap
of
gold
should
part
him
and
his
brother
so
far
asunder
.
 
<EOS>
For
he
was
a
loving
man
before
he
grew
mad
with
seeing
such
as
he
was
slighted
,
as
if
Christ
Himself
had
not
been
poor
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
time
,
I
've
heard
him
say
,
he
felt
kindly
towards
every
man
,
rich
or
poor
,
because
he
thought
they
were
all
men
alike
.
 
<EOS>
But
latterly
he
grew
aggravated
with
the
sorrows
and
suffering
that
he
saw
,
and
<EOS>
which
he
thought
the
masters
might
help
if
they
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
notion
<EOS>
you
've
all
of
you
got
,
"
said
Mr.
Carson
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
how
in
the
world
can
we
help
it
?
 
<EOS>
We
can
not
regulate
the
demand
for
labour
.
 
<EOS>
No
man
or
set
of
men
can
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
depends
on
events
which
God
alone
can
control
.
 
<EOS>
When
there
is
no
market
for
our
goods
,
we
suffer
just
as
much
as
you
can
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
as
much
,
I
'm
sure
,
sir
;
though
I
'm
not
given
to
Political
Economy
,
I
know
that
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
wanting
in
learning
<EOS>
,
I
'm
aware
;
but
I
can
use
my
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
the
masters
getting
thin
and
haggard
for
want
of
food
;
I
hardly
ever
see
them
making
much
change
in
their
way
of
living
,
though
I
do
n't
doubt
they
've
got
to
do
it
in
bad
times
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
in
things
for
show
they
cut
short
;
while
for
such
as
me
,
it
's
in
things
for
life
we
've
to
stint
.
 
<EOS>
For
sure
,
sir
,
you
'll
own
it
's
come
to
a
hard
pass
when
a
man
would
give
aught
in
the
world
for
work
to
keep
his
children
from
starving
,
and
ca
n't
get
a
bit
,
if
he
's
ever
so
willing
to
labour
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
not
up
to
talking
as
John
Barton
would
have
done
,
but
that
's
clear
to
me
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
good
man
,
just
listen
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Two
men
live
in
solitude
;
one
produces
loaves
of
bread
,
the
other
coats
,
 
or
what
you
will
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
would
it
not
be
hard
if
the
bread
-
producer
were
forced
to
give
bread
for
the
coats
,
whether
he
wanted
them
or
not
,
in
order
to
furnish
employment
to
the
other
?
 
<EOS>
That
is
the
simple
form
of
the
case
;
you
've
only
to
multiply
the
numbers
.
 
<EOS>
There
will
come
times
of
great
changes
in
the
occupation
of
thousands
,
when
improvements
in
manufactures
and
machinery
are
made
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
nonsense
talking
,
 
it
must
be
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
Job
Legh
pondered
a
few

"
It
's
true
it
was
a
sore
time
for
the
hand
-
loom
weavers
when
power
-
looms
came
in
:
<EOS>
them
new
-
fangled
things
make
a
man
's
life
like
a
lottery
;
and
yet
I
'll
never
misdoubt
that
power
-
looms
and
railways
,
and
all
such
-
like
inventions
,
are
the
gifts
of
God
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
lived
long
enough
,
too
,
to
see
that
it
is
a
part
of
His
plan
to
send
suffering
to
bring
out
a
higher
good
;
but
surely
it
's
also
a
part
of
His
plan
that
so
much
of
the
burden
of
the
suffering
as
can
be
should
be
lightened
by
those
whom
it
is
His
pleasure
to
make
happy
,
and
content
in
their
own
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
it
would
take
a
deal
more
thought
and
wisdom
than
me
,
or
any
other
man
has
,
to
settle
out
of
hand
how
this
should
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'm
clear
about
this
,
when
God
gives
a
blessing
to
be
enjoyed
,
He
gives
it
with
a
duty
to
be
done
;
and
the
duty
of
the
happy
is
to
help
the
suffering
to
bear
their
woe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Still
facts
have
proved
,
and
are
daily
proving
,
how
much
better
it
is
for
every
man
to
be
independent
of
help
,
and
self
-
reliant
,
"
said
Mr.
Carson
thoughtfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
never
work
facts
as
you
would
fixed
quantities
,
and
say
,
given
two
facts
,
and
the
product
is
so
and
so
.
 
<EOS>
God
has
given
men
feelings
and
passions
which
can
not
be
worked
into
the
problem
,
because
they
are
for
ever
changing
and
uncertain
.
 
<EOS>
God
has
also
made
some
weak
;
not
in
any
one
way
,
but
in
all
.
 
<EOS>
One
is
weak
in
body
,
another
in
mind
,
another
in
steadiness
of
purpose
,
a
fourth
ca
n't
tell
right
from
wrong
,
and
so
on
;
or
if
he
can
tell
the
right
,
he
wants
strength
to
hold
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
to
my
thinking
,
them
that
is
strong
in
any
of
God
's
gifts
is
meant
to
help
the
weak

be
hanged

the
facts

<EOS>
I
ask
your
pardon
,
sir
;
I
ca
n't
rightly
explain
the
meaning
that
is
in
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
like
a
tap
as
wo
n't
run
,
but
keeps
letting
it
out
drop
by
drop
,
so
that
you
've
no

the
force

what
's
within

Job
looked
and
felt
very
sorrowful
at
the
want
of
power
in
his
words
,
while
the
feeling
within
him
was
so
strong
and
clear
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
you
say
is
very
true
,
no
doubt
,
"
replied
Mr.
Carson
;
"
but
how
would
you
bring
it
to
bear
upon
the
masters
'
conduct
,
 
on
my
particular
case
?

"
added
he
gravely
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
learned
enough
to
argue
.
 
<EOS>
Thoughts
come
into
my
head
that
I
'm
sure
are
as
true
as
Gospel
,
though
maybe
they
do
n't
follow
each
other
like
the
Q.E.D.
of
a
Proposition

<EOS>
The
masters
has
it
on
their
own
conscience
,
 
you
have
it
on
yours
,
sir
,
to
answer
for
to
God
whether
you
've
done
,
and
are
doing
all
in
your
power
to
lighten
the
evils
that
seem
always
to
hang
on
the
trades
by
which
you
make
your
fortunes

<EOS>
It
's
no
business
of
mine
,
thank
God

<EOS>
John
Barton
took
the
question
in
hand
,
and
his
answer
to
it
was
NO
!
 
<EOS>
Then
he
grew
bitter
,
and
angry
,
and
mad
;
and
in
his
madness
he
did
a
great
sin
,
and
wrought
a
great
woe
;
and
repented
him
with
tears
of
blood
,
and
will
go
through
his
penance
humbly
and
meekly
in
t'other
place
,
I
'll
be
bound

<EOS>
I
never
seed
such
bitter
repentance
as
his
that
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
silence
of
many
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
had
covered
his
face
,
and
seemed
utterly
forgetful
of
their
presence
;
and
yet
they
did
not
like
to
disturb
him
by
rising
to
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
he
said
,
without
meeting
their
sympathetic
eyes
   
"
Thank
you
both
for
coming
,
 
and
for
speaking
candidly
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
,
Legh
,
neither
you
nor
I
have
convinced
each
other
,
as
to
the
power
,
or
want
of
power
,
in
the
masters
to
remedy
the
evils
the
men
complain
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
loth
to
vex
you
,
sir
,
just
now
;
but
it
was
not
the
want
of
power
I
was
talking
on
;
what
we
all
feel
sharpest
is
the
want
of
inclination
to
try
and
help
the
evils
which
come
like
blights
at
times
over
the
manufacturing
places
,
while
we
see
the
masters
can
stop
work
and
not
suffer
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
saw
the
masters
try
for
our
sakes
to
find
a
remedy
,
 
even
if
they
were
long
about
it
,
 
even
if
they
could
find
no
help
,
and
at
the
end
of
all
could
only
say
,
"
Poor
fellows
,
our
hearts
are
sore
for
ye
;
we
've
done
all
we
could
,
and
ca
n't
find
a
cure
,
"
 
we
'd
bear
up
like
men
through
bad
times
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
knows
till
they
have
tried
,
what
power
of
bearing
lies
in
them
,
if
once
they
believe
that
men
are
caring
for
their
sorrows
and
will
help
if
they
can
.
 
<EOS>
If
fellow
-
creatures
can
give
nought
but
tears
and
brave
words
,
we
take
our
trials
straight
from
God
,
and
we
know
enough
of
His
love
to
put
ourselves
blind
into
His
hands
.
 
<EOS>
You
say
our
talk
has
done
no
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
it
has
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
view
you
take
of
things
from
the
place
where
you
stand
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
remember
that
,
when
the
time
comes
for
judging
you
;
I
sha
n't
think
any
longer
,
does
he
act
right
on
my
views
of
a
thing
,
but
does
he
act
right
on
his
own
.
<EOS>
It
has
done
me
good
in
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
an
old
man
,
and
may
never
see
you
again
;
but
I
'll
pray
for
you
,
and
think
on
you
and
your
trials
,
both
of
your
great
wealth
,
and
of
your
son
's
cruel
death
,
many
and
many
a
day
to
come
;
and
I
'll
ask
God
to
bless
both

you
now
and
for
evermore

Farewell

"
  
<EOS>
Jem
had
maintained
a
manly
and
dignified
reserve
ever
since
he
had
made
his
open
statement
of
all
he
knew
.
 
<EOS>
Now
both
the
men
rose
and
bowed
low
,
looking
at
Mr.
Carson
with
the
deep
human
interest
<EOS>
they
could
not
fail
to
take
in
one
who
had
endured
and
forgiven
a
deep
injury
;
and
who
struggled
hard
,
as
it
was
evident
he
did
,
to
bear
up
like
a
man
under
his
affliction
.
  
<EOS>
He
bowed
low
in
return
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
suddenly
came
forward
and
shook
them
by
the
hand
;
and
thus
,
without
a
word
more
,
they
parted
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
stages
in
the
contemplation
and
endurance
of
great
sorrow
,
which
endow
men
with
the
same
earnestness
and
clearness
of
thought
that
in
some
of
old
took
the
form
of
Prophecy
.
 
<EOS>
To
those
who
have
large
capability
of
loving
and
suffering
,
united
with
great
power
of
firm
endurance
,
there
comes
a
time
in
their
woe
,
when
they
are
lifted
out
of
the
contemplation
of
their
individual
case
into
a
searching
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
their
calamity
,
and
the
remedy
(
if
remedy
there
be
)
which
may
prevent
its
recurrence
to
others
as
well
as
to
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
Hence
the
beautiful
,
noble
efforts
which
are
from
time
to
time
brought
to
light
,
as
being
continuously
made
by
those
who
have
once
hung
on
the
cross
of
agony
,
in
order
that
others
may
not
suffer
as
they
have
done
;
one
of
the
grandest
ends
which
sorrow
can
accomplish
;
the
sufferer
wrestling
with
God
's
messenger
until
a
blessing
is
left
behind
,
not
for
one
alone
but
for
generations
.
  
<EOS>
It
took
time
before
the
stern
nature
of
Mr.
Carson
was
compelled
to
the
recognition
of
this
secret
of
comfort
,
and
that
same
sternness
prevented
his
reaping
any
benefit
in
public
estimation
from
the
actions
he
performed
;
for
the
character
is
more
easily
changed
than
the
habits
and
manners
originally
formed
by
that
character
,
and
to
his
dying
day
Mr.
Carson
was
considered
hard
and
cold
by
those
who
only
casually
saw
him
or
superficially
knew
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
those
who
were
admitted
into
his
confidence
were
aware
,
that
the
wish
that
lay
nearest
to
his
heart
was
that
none
might
suffer
from
the
cause
from
which
he
had
suffered
;
that
a
perfect
understanding
,
and
complete
confidence
and
love
,
might
exist
between
masters
and
men
;
that
the
truth
might
be
recognised
that
the
interests
of
one
were
the
interests
of
all
,
and
,
as
such
,
required
the
consideration
and
deliberation
of
all
;
that
hence
it
was
most
desirable
to
have
educated
workers
,
capable
of
judging
,
not
mere
machines
of
ignorant
men
:
and
to
have
them
bound
to
their
employers
by
the
ties
of
respect
and
affection
,
not
by
mere
money
bargains
alone
;
in
short
,
to
acknowledge
the
Spirit
of
Christ
as
the
regulating
law
between
both
parties
.
  
<EOS>
Many
of
the
improvements
now
in
practice
in
the
system
of
employment
in
Manchester
,
owe
their
origin
to
short
,
earnest
sentences
spoken
by
Mr.
Carson
.
 
<EOS>
Many
and
many
yet
to
be
carried
into
execution
,
take
their
birth
from
that
stern
,
thoughtful
mind
,
which
submitted
to
be
taught
by
suffering
.

BARRY
CORNWALL
.
  
<EOS>
Not
many
days
after
John
Barton
's
funeral
was
over
,
all
was
arranged
respecting
Jem
's
appointment
at
Toronto
;
and
the
time
was
fixed
for
his
sailing
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
to
take
place
almost
immediately
:
yet
much
remained
to
be
done
;
many
domestic
preparations
were
to
be
made
;
and
one
great
obstacle
,
anticipated
by
both
Jem
and
Mary
,
to
be
removed
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
opposition
they
expected
from
Mrs.
Wilson
,
to
whom
the
plan
had
never
yet
been
named
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
most
anxious
that
their
home
should
continue
ever
to
be
hers
,
yet
they
feared
that
her
dislike
to
a
new
country
might
be
an
insuperable
objection
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
Jem
took
advantage
of
an
evening
of
unusual
placidity
,
as
he
sat
alone
with
his
mother
just
before
going
to
bed
,
to
broach
the
subject
;
and
to
his
surprise
she
acceded
willingly
to
his
proposition
of
her
accompanying
himself
and
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
'
Merica
is
a
long
way
to
flit
to
;
beyond
London
a
good
bit
I
reckon
;
and
quite
in
foreign
parts
;
but
I
've
never
had
no
opinion
of
England
,
ever
since
they
could
be
such
fools
as
to
take
up
a
quiet
chap
like
thee
,
and
clap
thee
in
prison
.
 
<EOS>
Where
you
go
,
I
'll
go

<EOS>
Perhaps
in
them
Indian
countries
they
'll
know
a
well
-
behaved
lad
when
they
see
him
<EOS>
;
ne'er
speak
a
word
more
,
lad
,
I
'll
go

"
  
<EOS>
Their
path
became
daily
more
smooth
and
easy
;
the
present
was
clear
and
practicable
,
the
future
was
hopeful
;
they
had
leisure
of
mind
enough
to
turn
to
the
past
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jem
!
"
said
Mary
to
him
,
one
evening
as
they
sat
in
the
twilight
,
talking
together
in
low
happy
voices
till
Margaret
should
come
to
keep
Mary
company
through
the
night
,
"
Jem
!
<EOS>
you
've
never
yet
told
me
how
you
came
to
know
about
my
naughty
ways
with
poor
young
Mr.
Carson
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
blushed
for
shame
at
the
remembrance
of
her
folly
,
and
hid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
while
he
made
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Darling
,
I
'm
almost
loth
to
tell
you
;
your
aunt
Esther
told
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
remember
!
<EOS>
but
how
did
she
know
?
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
put
about
<EOS>
that
night
I
did
not
think
of
asking
her
.
 
<EOS>
Where
did
you
see
her
?
 
<EOS>
I
've
forgotten
where
she
lives
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
said
all
this
in
so
open
and
innocent
a
manner
,
that
Jem
felt
sure
she
knew
not
the
truth
respecting
Esther
,
and
he
half
hesitated
to
tell
her
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
replied
   
<EOS>
"
Where
did
you
see
Esther
lately
?
 
<EOS>
When
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
love
,
for
you
've
never
named
it
before
,
and
I
ca
n't
make
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
was
that
horrible
night
,
which
is
like
a
dream
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
told
him
of
Esther
's
midnight
visit
,
concluding
with
,
"
We
must
go
and
see
her
before
we
leave
,
though
I
do
n't
rightly
know
where
to
find
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dearest
Mary
"
    
"
What
,
Jem
?
"
exclaimed
she
,
alarmed
by
his
hesitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
poor
aunt
<EOS>
Esther
has
no
home
:
 
<EOS>
she
's
one
of
them
miserable
creatures
that
walk
the
streets
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
in
his
turn
told
of
his
encounter
with
Esther
,
with
so
many
details
that
Mary
was
forced
to
be
convinced
,
although
her
heart
rebelled
against
the
belief
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jem
,
lad
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
vehemently
,
"
we
must
find
her
out
 
<EOS>
we
must
hunt
her
up
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
rose
as
if
she
was
going
on
the
search
there
and
then
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
could
we
do
,
darling
?

<EOS>
asked
he
,
fondly
restraining
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
!
 
<EOS>
Why
!
<EOS>
what
could
we
NOT
do
,
if
we
could
but
find
her
?
 
<EOS>
She
's
none
so
happy
in
her
ways
,
think
ye
,
but
what
she
'd
turn
from
them
,
if
any
one
would
lend
her
a
helping
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
hold
me
,
Jem
;
this
is
just
the
time
for
such
as
her
to
be
out
,
and
who
knows
but
what
I
might
find
her
close
to
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
Mary
,
for
a
minute
;
I
'll
go
out
now
and
search
for
her
if
you
wish
,
though
it
's
but
a
wild
chase
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
go
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
better
to
ask
the
police
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
I
should
find
her
,
how
can
I
make
her
come
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
Once
before
she
refused
,
and
said
she
could
not
break
off
her
drinking
ways
,
come
what
might
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
will
persuade
her
if
you
fear
and
doubt
,
"
said
Mary
,
in
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hope
yourself
,
and
trust
to
the
good
that
must
be
in
her
.
<EOS>
Speak
to
that
,
 
she
has
it
in
her
yet
,
 
<EOS>
oh
,
bring
her
home
,
and
we
will
love
her
<EOS>
so
,
we
'll
make
her
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
"
said
Jem
,
catching
Mary
's
sanguine
spirit
;
"
she
shall
go
to
America
with
us
:
and
we
'll
help
her
to
get
rid
of
her
sins
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
now
,
my
precious
darling
,
and
if
I
ca
n't
find
her
,
it
's
but
<EOS>
trying
the
police
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Take
care
of
your
own
sweet
self
,
Mary
,
"
said
he
,
fondly
kissing
her
before
he
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
wandered
far
and
wide
that
night
,
but
never
met
Esther
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
day
he
applied
to
the
police
;
and
at
last
they
recognised
under
his
description
of
her
,
a
woman
known
to
them
under
the
name
of
the
"
Butterfly
,
"
from
the
gaiety
of
her
dress
a
year
or
two
ago
.
 
<EOS>
By
their
help
he
traced
out
one
of
her
haunts
,
a
low
lodging
-
house
behind
Peter
-
street
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
his
companion
,
a
kind
-
hearted
policeman
,
were
admitted
,
suspiciously
enough
,
by
the
landlady
,
who
ushered
them
into
a
large
garret
where
twenty
or
thirty
people
of
all
ages
and
both
sexes
lay
and
dosed
away
the
day
,
choosing
the
evening
and
night
for
their
trades
of
beggary
,
thieving
,
or
prostitution
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
Butterfly
was
here
,
"
said
she
,
looking
round
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
came
in
,
the
night
before
last
,
and
said
she
had
not
a
penny
to
get
a
place
for
shelter
;
and
that
if
she
was
far
away
in
the
country
she
could
steal
aside
and
die
in
a
copse
,
or
a
clough
,
like
the
wild
animals
;
but
here
the
police
would
let
no
one
alone
in
the
streets
,
and
she
wanted
a
spot
to
die
in
,
in
peace
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
queer
sort
of
peace
we
have
here
,
but
that
night
the
room
was
uncommon
empty
,
and
I
'm
not
a
hard
-
hearted
woman
<EOS>
(
I
wish
I
were
,
I
could
ha
'
made
a
good
thing
out
of
it
<EOS>
afore
this
if
I
were
harder
)
<EOS>
,
so
I
sent
her
up
 
<EOS>
but
she
's
not
here
now
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
she
very
bad
?
"
asked
Jem
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
nought
but
skin
and
bone
,
with
a
cough
to
tear
her
in
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
made
some
inquiries
,
and
found
that
in
the
restlessness
of
approaching
death
,
she
had
longed
to
be
once
more
in
the
open
air
,
and
had
gone
forth
 
<EOS>
where
,
no
one
seemed
to
be
able
to
tell
.
<EOS>
Leaving
many
messages
for
her
,
and
directions
that
he
was
to
be
sent
for
if
either
the
policeman
or
the
landlady
obtained
any
clue
to
her
whereabouts
,
Jem
bent
his
steps
towards
Mary
's
house
;
for
he
had
not
seen
her
all
that
long
day
of
search
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
her
of
his
proceedings
and
want
of
success
;
and
both
were
saddened
at
the
recital
,
and
sat
silent
for
some
time
.
  
<EOS>
After
awhile
they
began
talking
over
their
plans
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
day
or
two
,
Mary
was
to
give
up
house
,
and
go
and
live
for
a
week
or
so
with
Job
Legh
,
until
the
time
of
her
marriage
,
which
would
take
place
immediately
before
sailing
;
they
talked
themselves
back
into
silence
and
delicious
reverie
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
sat
by
Jem
,
his
arm
around
her
waist
,
her
head
on
his
shoulder
;
and
thought
over
the
scenes
which
 
had
passed
in
that
home
she
was
so
soon
to
leave
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
she
felt
Jem
start
,
and
started
too
without
knowing
why
;
she
tried
to
see
his
countenance
,
but
the
shades
of
evening
had
deepened
so
much
she
could
read
no
expression
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
turned
to
the
window
;
she
looked
and
saw
a
white
face
pressed
against
the
panes
on
the
outside
,
gazing
intently
into
the
dusky
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
While
they
watched
,
as
if
fascinated
by
the
appearance
,
and
 
unable
to
think
or
stir
,
a
film
came
over
the
bright
,
feverish
,
glittering
eyes
outside
,
and
the
form
sank
down
to
the
ground
without
a
struggle
of
instinctive
resistance
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
Esther
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
they
,
both
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
They
rushed
outside
;
and
,
fallen
into
what
appeared
simply
a
heap
of
white
or
light
-
coloured
clothes
,
fainting
or
dead
,
lay
the
poor
crushed
Butterfly
 
<EOS>
the
once
innocent
Esther
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
come
(
as
a
wounded
deer
drags
its
heavy
limbs
once
more
to
the
green
coolness
of
the
lair
in
which
it
was
born
,
there
to
die
)
to
see
the
place
familiar
to
her
innocence
,
yet
once
again
before
her
death
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
she
was
indeed
alive
or
dead
,
they
knew
not
now
.
  
<EOS>
Job
came
in
with
Margaret
,
for
it
was
bedtime
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
<EOS>
Esther
's
pulse
beat
a
little
yet
.
 
<EOS>
They
carried
her
upstairs
and
laid
her
on
Mary
's
bed
,
not
daring
to
undress
her
,
lest
any
motion
should
frighten
the
trembling
life
away
;
but
it
was
all
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
Towards
midnight
,
she
opened
wide
her
eyes
and
looked
around
on
the
once
familiar
room
;
<EOS>
Job
Legh
knelt
by
the
bed
praying
aloud
and
fervently
for
her
,
but
he
stopped
as
he
saw
her
roused
look
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
up
in
bed
with
a
sudden
convulsive
motion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
it
been
a
dream
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
asked
she
wildly
.
 
<EOS>
Then
with
a
habit
,
which
came
like
instinct
even
in
that
awful
dying
hour
,
her
hand
sought
for
a
locket
which
hung
concealed
in
her
bosom
,
and
,
finding
that
,
she
knew
all
was
true
which
had
befallen
her
since
last
she
lay
an
innocent
girl
on
that
bed
.
  
<EOS>
She
fell
back
,
and
spoke
word
never
more
.
 
<EOS>
She
held
the
locket
containing
her
child
's
hair
still
in
her
hand
,
and
once
or
twice
she
kissed
it
with
a
long
soft
kiss
.
 
<EOS>
She
cried
feebly
and
sadly
as
long
as
she
had
any
strength
to
cry
,
and
then
she
died
.
  
<EOS>
They
laid
her
in
one
grave
with
John
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
they
lie
without
name
,
or
initial
,
or
date
.
 
<EOS>
Only
this
verse
is
inscribed
upon
the
stone
which
covers
the
remains
of
these
two
wanderers
.
  
<EOS>
Psalm
ciii
.
<EOS>
v.
9
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
He
will
not
always
chide
,
neither
will
He
keep
His
anger
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
see
a
long
,
low
,
wooden
house
,
with
room
enough
and
to
spare
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
primeval
trees
are
felled
and
gone
for
many
a
mile
around
;
one
alone
remains
to
overshadow
the
gable
-
end
of
the
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
garden
around
the
dwelling
,
and
far
beyond
that
stretches
an
orchard
.
 
<EOS>
The
glory
of
an
Indian
summer
is
over
all
,
making
the
heart
leap
at
the
sight
of
its
gorgeous
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
door
of
the
house
,
looking
towards
the
town
,
stands
Mary
,
watching
the
return
of
her
husband
from
his
daily
work
;
and
while
she
watches
,
she
listens
,
smiling
   
<EOS>
"
Clap
hands
,
daddy
comes
,
With
his
pocket
full
of
plums
,
And
a
cake
for
Johnnie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
comes
a
crow
of
delight
from
Johnnie
.
 
<EOS>
Then
his
grandmother
carries
him
to
the
door
,
and
glories
in
seeing
him
resist
his
mother
's
blandishments
to
cling
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
English
letters

<EOS>
'
Twas

me
so
late

<EOS>
"
O
Jem
,
Jem
!
<EOS>
do
n't
hold
them
so
tight
!
 
<EOS>
What
do
they
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
some
good
news
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
give
a
guess
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
tell
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
guess
,
"
said
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
give
it
up
,
do
you
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
,
mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
Jane
Wilson
thought
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
and
Margaret
are
married
?
"
asked
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
exactly
,
 
but
very
near
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
woman
has
twice
the
spirit
of
the
young
one
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
Mary
,
give
a
guess
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
covered
his
little
boy
's
eyes
with
his
hands
for
an
instant
,
significantly
,
till
the
baby
pushed
them
down
,
saying
in
his
imperfect
way
   
"
Tan't
see

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
There
now
!
 
<EOS>
Johnnie
can
see

<EOS>
Do
you
guess

Mary
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
've
done
something
to
Margaret
to
give
her
back
her
sight
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
been
couched
,
and
can
see
as
well

<EOS>
She
and
Will
are
to
be
married
on
the
twenty
-
fifth
of
this
month
,
and
he
's
bringing
her
out
next
voyage
;
and
Job
Legh
talks
of
coming
too
,
 
not
to
see
you

Mary
,
 
nor

,
 
nor

(
kissing
him
)
,
"
but
to
try
and
pick
up
a
few
specimens
of
Canadian
insects
,
Will
says
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
compliment
is
to

earwigs

<EOS>
"
Dear

Mary

softly

seriously
